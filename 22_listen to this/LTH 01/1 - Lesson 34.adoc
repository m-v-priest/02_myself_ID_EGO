== Section 1 段；部分

Listen to these people talking about videos. +

Speech 1:  +
1. I borrow videos every week. I can watch cartoons or adventures 冒险；冒险经历；奇遇 at any time and I can watch them over and over again. I never watch children's programs on television any more. +

Speech 2: +
2. My wife likes the video because she doesn't speak any English. But I say, if she doesn't hear English, how can she learn it? She needs to learn English to meet people and make friends. +

Speech 3: +
3. Videos are ruining the cinema, of course. Too many people copy films instead of buying or borrowing them. There are too many pirates  海盗;盗版者；盗印者. Of course, more people can see their favorite films now. Videos are obviously cheaper than the cinema, but they don't have the same effect, do they? +

Speech 4: +
4. I watch the video every day while I knit (v.)编织；针织；机织 —mostly old films, ice-skating and pop videos. I used to watch television all the time —news, talk shows, soap operas —anything that was on. Now I can choose what I watch and when I watch it. +

Speech 5: +
5. A lot of educational videos are made with government money and video is used by a lot of schools now. Videos can be used at any time of the day and they can be stopped and replayed. When I was learning to be a teacher we were filmed and we could see our
mistakes. Of course some teachers just put the video on and let it do the work, but it can be extremely valuable in the classroom. +

Speech 6: +
6. I use the video for three things: I record programs when I'm not at home and I watch
them when I have time. At work we use videos for training new employees, and I hire 租用；租借 films at weekends 星期六和星期日；周末 and my friends come to watch. It makes quite a nice social evening. +


听听这些人在谈论视频。



演讲1: +
1.我每周都借录像带。我可以在任何时候看卡通或冒险，我可以一遍又一遍地看。我再也不看儿童电视节目了。

演讲2: +
2.我妻子喜欢这个视频，因为她不会说英语。但是我说，如果她听不到英语，她怎么能学呢?她需要学习英语来认识人和交朋友。

演讲3: +
3.当然，视频正在毁掉电影院。太多的人拷贝电影而不是购买或借阅。海盗太多了。当然，现在更多的人可以看到他们喜欢的电影了。视频显然比电影院便宜，但效果却不一样，不是吗?

演讲4: +
4.我每天在编织的时候都会看录像——主要是老电影、滑冰和流行音乐的录像。我过去总是看电视——新闻、脱口秀、肥皂剧——任何正在播放的节目。现在我可以选择看什么，什么时候看。

演讲5: +
5.很多教育视频是用政府的钱制作的，现在很多学校都在使用视频。视频可以在一天中的任何时间使用，它们可以停止和重播。当我学习成为一名教师时，我们被拍摄下来，我们可以看到我们的错误。当然，有些老师只是把视频放上去，让它自己完成任务，但它在课堂上非常有价值。

演讲6: +
6.我用视频做三件事:我不在家的时候录节目，有时间的时候看。在工作中，我们用视频来培训新员工，我在周末放电影，我的朋友们来观看。这是一个很好的社交之夜。

== Section 2

==== A. Discussion.

Speaker A: Well, hunk is a verb. And it means to carry something, particularly something that’s heavy and difficult to move. So you can say something like 'When I saw the men they were hunking the piano down the stairs.'

Speaker B: Actually, hunk is the cry made by an elephant, especially when it’s angry, or it’s trying to contact other elephants. The word sounds like the noise they make 'hunk, hunk.' So you can say, for example, 'The elephants are hunking a lot tonight.'

Speaker C: No, no, the truth is, hunk （尤指食物切下或掰下的）大块，大片 is a noun. And it means a piece of something, a big thick piece. So if you cut a thin piece of bread, that’s not a hunk. When you tear off a thick piece of bread, that’s a hunk. Today, for example, I had a big hunk of bread and cheese for my lunch.

答:讨论。

说话者甲:嗯，大块头是个动词。它的意思是携带某物，尤其是那些重而难移动的东西。所以你可以这样说:“当我看到那些人的时候，他们正把钢琴拖下楼梯。”

说话者B:实际上，“hunk”是大象发出的叫声，尤其是当它生气的时候，或者它试图联系其他大象的时候。这个词听起来就像他们发出的声音:“大块头，大块头。”所以你可以说，例如，“大象今晚很胖。”

说话者丙:不，不，事实是，大块头是个名词。它的意思是某物的一块，又大又厚的一块。所以如果你切一片薄面包，那不是大块的。当你撕下一片厚厚的面包时，那是一大块。例如，今天我午餐吃了一大块面包和奶酪。

==== B. Mark.

Tony; Whew （惊讶、宽慰或感到很热、疲劳时发出的声音）哟，噢. The disco wasn't bad but I'm glad to escape from the noise. Aren't you? +
Richard: Ummmmm. +
Tony: Richard, I'd forgotten. You've got a letter. Now where did I put it? There it is. Under the gas bill 燃气费账单. +
Richard: Oh, from my brother. +
Tony: Good. How many brothers have you got? +
Richard: Only one. +
Tony: Name? +
Richard: Mark. +
Tony: Older or younger? +
Richard: Much older. +
Tony: How much? +
Richard: Five years. +
Tony: *Get on* 进展，过得去，与某人相处得好 all right? +
Richard: Yes, all right. +
Tony: Tell me about Mark. You must have a lot in common. Such as problems. +
Richard: Well, when I have a real problem I usually discuss it with Mark. +
Tony: And what is a real problem? +
Richard: Money is one. But Mark never minds (v.)对（某事）烦恼，苦恼，焦虑；介意  *helping* me *out* 帮助某人摆脱（困境）. +
Tony: You say money is one problem. I suppose you mean there are others. +
Richard: Well, yes. Of course there are. Friends and possessions 个人财产；私人物品. He knows who my friends are and I know who his friends are. But when we meet we hardly ever speak. His friends aren't interested in talking to my friends. And my friends think his friends are boring and patronising (a.)自认为高人一等的；摆派头的. +
Tony: Go on, Richard. You mentioned possessions. What about possessions? +
Richard: I can never find my favorite cassettes 磁带盒；盒式磁带； 卡式磁带. Mark and his friends keep borrowing them. I suppose Mark has a point when he says he can't find his calculator. I use it whenever I can find it. +
Tony: So ... if you were in real trouble, who would you contact first? +
Richard: Mark, of course. +

马克。 +
托尼;唷。迪斯科舞厅不错，但我很高兴能远离噪音。不是吗? +
理查德:真是。 +
托尼:理查德，我都忘了。你有一封信。我把它放哪了?就是这个。在煤气费账单下。 +
哦，我哥哥送的。 +
托尼:好的。你有几个兄弟? +
理查德:只有一个。 +
托尼:名字? +
理查德:马克。 +
托尼:老一点还是小一点? +
理查德:老多了。 +
托尼:多少钱? +
理查德:五年了。 +
托尼:还好吧? +
理查德:是的，好的。 +
托尼:跟我说说马克吧。你们一定有很多共同之处。比如问题。 +
理查德:嗯，当我遇到真正的问题时，我通常会和马克讨论。 +
托尼:什么是真正的问题? +
理查德:钱是其中之一。但马克从不介意帮我。 +
托尼:你说钱是一个问题。我想你的意思是还有其他人。 +
理查德:嗯，是的。当然有。朋友和财产。他知道我的朋友是谁，我也知道他的朋友是谁。但当我们见面时，我们几乎不说话。他的朋友对和我的朋友说话不感兴趣。我的朋友们认为他的朋友们无聊又傲慢。 +
托尼:接着说，理查德。你提到了财产。财产呢? +
理查德:我从来找不到我最喜欢的磁带。马克和他的朋友们一直在借它们。我想马克说他找不到计算器是有道理的。只要我能找到，我就用它。 +
托尼:那么，如果你真的遇到麻烦了，你会先联系谁? +
理查德:当然是马克。 +

==== C. Gardening. +

Chairman: Now Mr. Grant has a question, I think, on gardening. Mr. Grant?

Mr. Grant: Can the team please suggest any suitable gardening task that could be given to young children between eight and twelve years old.
Chairman: I usually get them to wash my car. But a gardening task, well, what do you suggest, Peter? Peter: There’s a great tendency 倾向；偏好；性情;趋势；趋向 among some people I know to treat young children like slave labor. I don’t think you should. I think you should give them a job which is going to be useful to you, not one that you would object 不同意；不赞成；反对 to doing yourself and, if possible, one which is going to be of some educational benefit to them. A job I would suggest is hand weeding 除草.

Chairman: You must have thought about this, Jeff. What job would you give them? +
Jeff: Well, I’d sooner have them eating ice cream. No, seriously, I like having young people in the garden. One thing that they enjoy doing, because they get very messy (a.)肮脏的；凌乱的；不整洁的, is cleaning tools, you know spades  锹；铲, rakes 耙子；耙状工具 and things like that. I mean you give a little boy an old rag  抹布；破布 to clean them with /and he is so happy. Another job they love /and which I hate absolutely /is edging 给…加边. You know, trying to give a shape to the lawn  草坪；草地. They make a horrible mess of it /cutting it smaller and smaller and giving it no shape at all, but they thoroughly 非常；极其；彻底；完全 enjoy it. The other thing that I like to give them to do is pot  （某种用途的）容器,锅,罐，瓶，壶 washing. They’re not so keen (a.) on 渴望；热切；热衷于  that but I get them to wash the pots. But anything that’s going to get them messy, lovely!

Chairman: What do you say, Susan?  +
Susan: Well, I would say heaven help any young boy or girl who came into my garden because their life would be made a misery 痛苦；悲惨;不幸的事；痛苦的事. The only way I would let anybody touch my garden is if I was in the garden with them /and working alongside 与…一起；与…同时, so I think the only thing to do is, whatever you do, work with them /and make sure (a) that it’s done properly /and (b) that they’re happy while they do it.

主席:现在格兰特先生有一个关于园艺的问题。格兰特先生吗? +
格兰特先生:请团队建议一些适合的园艺任务, 给8到12岁的孩子。

主席:我通常让他们帮我洗车。但是一个园艺任务，你有什么建议，彼得? +
彼得:在我认识的一些人中，有一种很大的倾向，他们把小孩子当作奴隶一样对待。我觉得你不应该这么做。我认为你应该给他们一份对你有用的工作，而不是你自己反对做的工作，如果可能的话，一份对他们有教育意义的工作。我的建议是手工除草。

主席:你一定想过这个，杰夫。你会给他们什么工作?

杰夫:嗯，我宁愿让他们吃冰淇淋。不，说真的，我喜欢花园里有年轻人。他们喜欢做的一件事，因为他们会弄得很乱，那就是清洁工具，你知道铲子，耙子之类的东西。我的意思是，你给一个小男孩一块旧抹布来擦它们，他会很高兴。另一份他们喜欢而我非常讨厌的工作是边缘化。你知道，试着给草坪一个形状。他们把它弄得一团糟，把它切得越来越小，根本没有形状，但他们非常喜欢它。我喜欢让他们做的另一件事是洗锅。他们不太喜欢，但我让他们洗锅。但是任何会弄脏他们的东西，可爱!

主席:苏珊，你说呢?苏珊:嗯，我想说，上帝会帮助任何来到我花园的男孩或女孩，因为他们的生活将会变得痛苦。我让任何人触摸我的花园的唯一方式, 就是我和他们一起在花园里工作，所以我认为唯一要做的就是，无论你做什么，都要和他们一起工作，确保(a)做得好，(b)他们做的时候很开心。

Speaker 1: No, no, I wouldn't say that. +
Interviewer: Are you excited 激动的；兴奋的, perhaps? +
Speaker 1: Excited? No, no, not at all. What's there to be excited about? +
Interviewer: Well, a lot of people who go to boxing matches seem to be excited. +
Speaker 1: Yes, I know. But I really *can't understand* why anybody should do that sort of thing *at all*. +
Interviewer: What? Go to a boxing match? Or box in one? +
Speaker 1: No, the first. I ... I think ... well ... it's hard to understand why people should want to *earn their living* 谋生 by fighting, but I think I can. I mean, it's the money, isn't it? No, I meant going to a thing like that and watching it. I ... I just can't understand it. That's all. +
Speaker 2: Well, before ... I used to be disgusted by the idea of this sort of thing. Men fighting for money. Blood. All that sort of thing. +
Interviewer: And now? +
Speaker 2: Well, since I've started going to a few boxing matches with my boyfriend, I
think I see something ... something else in it. +
Interviewer: What? +
Speaker 2: Well ... perhaps you'll be surprised when I say this ... but I think there's a real element 少量；有点；有些 of skill. Yes. Skill. +
Interviewer: What kind of skill? +
Speaker 2: Physical skill 身体技能. Those men are really ... fit 健壮的；健康的. And if you watch two good boxers ... boxers who know what they're doing ... you can see the skill. The way they ... they ... the way they watch each other and wait for an opening. That sort of thing. It's quite exciting,
really. A bit like ... a chess 国际象棋 game. Yes. +
Speaker 3: To me it's just disgusting 极糟的；令人不快的;令人厌恶的；令人气愤的. A brutal, disgusting spectacle 精彩的表演；壮观的场面. It ought to be banned.
It sickens (v.)使大为震惊；使愤怒;患病；生病 me ... the very thought of it sickens me. +


体育中的暴力。 +
三个人在发表他们对拳击的看法。 +
 +
提问者1:当我看到这样的照片时，我感觉，嗯，我感觉，我不太确定我的感觉。 +
采访者:也许是厌恶?吓坏了吗? +
提问者1:不，不，我不会这么说。 +
采访者:你是不是很兴奋? +
提问者1:兴奋吗?不，不，一点也不。有什么好兴奋的? +
记者:嗯，很多去看拳击比赛的人似乎都很兴奋。 +
提问者1:是的，我知道。但我真的不明白为什么有人要做那种事。 +
面试官:什么?去看拳击比赛?还是一个盒子? +
提问者1:不，是第一个。我…我想…嗯…很难理解为什么人们要靠打架来谋生，但我想我可以。我是说，是钱的问题，不是吗?不，我是说去看那种表演。我…我就是不明白。这是所有。 +
提问者2:在此之前，我对这种事情很反感。男人为钱而战。血。诸如此类的事情。 +
采访者:现在呢? +
说话者2:嗯，自从我开始和我男朋友去看几场拳击比赛以来，我想我看到了一些……一些别的东西。 +
面试官:什么? +
提话者2:嗯。也许当我这么说的时候你会感到惊讶。但是我认为这确实有技巧的因素。是的。技能。 +
面试官:什么样的技能? +
说话者2:身体技能。那些人真的……很健康。如果你观察两个优秀的拳击手，他们知道自己在做什么，你就能看到他们的技巧。他们…，他们…，他们看着对方等待机会的样子。诸如此类的事情。真的很令人兴奋。有点像棋局。是的。 +
提问者3:对我来说，这很恶心。残酷、恶心的场面。它应该被禁止。我一想到它就恶心。 +

==== E. Films. +

Woman: Well, what did you think of the film, Margaret? +
Margaret: Oh, I enjoyed it actually. But I do like musicals 音乐剧 and I think Julie Andrews is wonderful. +
Woman: Lovely  美丽的；优美的；有吸引力的；迷人的;令人愉快的；极好的 voice. +
Margaret: Oh, beautiful. +
Woman: And a lovely face. +
Margaret: Oh, she's very very attractive. +
Woman: I can't think why so many people criticize her. +
Margaret: Oh well, a lot of people do, but I think it's a snob 自以为优越的人；自命高雅的人;势利小人；谄上欺下的人 thing with a lot of people. +
Woman: I've always enjoyed her films. Very well produced, too. +
Margaret: Oh, excellent 优秀的；杰出的；极好的, yes. +
Woman: Those lovely scenes in the Alps 阿尔卑斯山脉. +
Margaret: Yes, where she was doing that number  一首歌，一段舞蹈（尤指演出的节目） where she was dancing on the hills. +
Woman: Mm, and that scene in the school. It brought tears to my eyes. What about next
week then? +
Margaret: Yes, what are we going to see next week? Do you know what's on? I haven't

Margaret: Really? Are they bringing that back again? +
Woman: I believe so. But it's on at the Odeon 音乐厅，剧场, on the other side of town, so it would involve quite a bit of travelling . +
Margaret: Oh, yes, but I'd go anywhere to see Frank Sinatra. +
Woman: I'd forgotten he was in it, so he is. Well, let's try and see that if we can. +
Margaret: I have seen it before, of course, but they're always bringing it back. +
Woman: What do you say, shall we meet for tea and then take in a matinee （戏剧、电影的）午后场，日场? +

Woman: Now what about the Odeon cafe. Four o'clock?
Margaret; Fine. Which day? +
Woman: Tuesday? +
Margaret: No, I can't make it Tuesday. How about Thursday? +
Woman: Yes, Thursday is all right. My husband likes to *go off to* 动身前往, 离开去做某事
 his club on Thursday. +
Margaret: So Thursday, four o'clock, have tea and then go and see Guys and Dolls. Well,
that'll be nice because I do like Frank Sinatra. So I'll see you on Thursday. I have to *be off* 离开，走开 now. Goodbye. +

== Section 3

==== A. Boat Trip.

Angela Rogers is describing a boat trip which she took with her husband down the Nile.

It was the summer of last year when we went. It was a special package （必须整体接收的）一套东西，一套建议；一揽子交易 holiday 包价旅游,一缆子度假计划 which included three days in Cairo 开罗（埃及首都）, and a week cruising 乘船游览；航行 down the Nile. It sounded lovely in the brochure 资料（或广告）手册. Relaxing, luxurious, delicious food —all the usual things. And the boat looked nice in the picture. In fact when we got there, and on the boat, it was exactly the opposite of luxurious. It was positively 绝对地；肯定地 uncomfortable. It was too small to be comfortable. And too hot. The only air-conditioning was from the wind, and inside, in the cabins （轮船上工作或生活的）隔间,（飞机的）座舱, it was too hot to sleep, and the dining room was stifling  热得难受的,令人感到压抑的.

My husband and I paid *the special rate* 价格,费用;优惠价格 for the best cabin （轮船上工作或生活的）隔间. I’m glad we didn’t have to stay in the worst one. The cabins were very poorly equipped; there wasn’t even a mirror, or a socket （电源）插座 for *a hair drier*, or even a point  某地方；地点 for *the electric razor* 剃须刀；刮脸刀. There was a shower, but *the water pressure* wasn’t high enough to use it. The cabin was badly designed as well. There wasn’t enough room to move. The beds *took up* 占用（时间、空间等） three quarters 四分之三 of the space.

The brochure  资料（或广告）手册 also talked about the mouth-watering  (a.)（食物）令人垂涎的，非常好吃的 *French cuisine* （通常指昂贵的饭店中的）饭菜，菜肴;烹饪；风味 available on board, but you could hardly call it food. It was boring, and practically inedible 不能吃的；不宜食用的. There was nothing to do, really. There was a table-tennis table, but one bat 球棒；球拍；球板 was broken. In the daytime the decks were so crowded, there wasn’t even enough room to sit. We did stop *now and then* 偶尔，有时候 for a swim, but who wants to swim in that filthy  肮脏的；污秽的;下流的；淫秽的；猥亵的 river? I certainly didn’t.

乘船旅行。 +
安吉拉·罗杰斯正在描述她和丈夫乘船沿尼罗河而下的一次旅行。 +
 +
我们去的时候是去年夏天。这是一个特别的旅游套餐，包括三天的开罗之旅和一周的尼罗河之旅。宣传册上写得很好。放松、奢华、美味的食物——都是平常的东西。这艘船在照片上看起来很漂亮。事实上，当我们到达那里，在船上，这是完全相反的豪华。这确实很不舒服。它太小了，不舒服。而且太热了。唯一的空调来自风，在船舱里，太热了，不能睡觉，餐厅里令人窒息。 +
 +
我丈夫和我付了优惠价买了最好的小屋。我很高兴我们不用住在最糟糕的地方。小屋的设备非常简陋;连镜子都没有，连吹风机的插座都没有，连电动剃须刀的刀尖都没有。有淋浴，但水压不够高，无法使用。机舱的设计也很糟糕。没有足够的空间移动。床占了四分之三的空间。 +
 +
宣传册上还提到了船上令人垂涎欲滴的法国美食，但你很难称之为美食。它很无聊，几乎无法下咽。没有什么可做的，真的。有一张乒乓球桌，但是有一个球棒坏了。白天，甲板上挤满了人，连坐的地方都没有。我们确实偶尔停下来游泳，但谁想在那条肮脏的河里游泳呢?我当然没有。 +

==== B. Interview.

Professor Ernest Taylor is a sociologist and the author of *a number of 一些 books*. He was interviewed recently on CBC radio by Norman Blunt.

Blunt: Now Professor 教授,（大学的）讲师，教员, in your latest book *Granny 奶奶；姥姥 Doesn’t Live Here Any More*, you suggest that Granny is a problem, and she is going to become even more of a problem in the future. Am I correct?

Taylor: Yes, in fact it’s not only Granny who is a problem, it’s Grandfather, too, and old people in general.

Blunt: Now, is this a peculiarly British phenomenon 现象? It seems very sad that parents should give so much of their lives to *bringing up* 抚养，培养 their children and then, when they become old, *be regarded as* a problem.

Taylor: Our research was mainly *carried out* 执行：完成或实施（计划、任务、指示等） in Britain. In many countries *it is still regarded as quite natural* that a widowed mother should go to *live with* one of her married children, but in Britain, certainly during the last thirty or forty years, there has been considerable 相当多（或大、重要等）的 resistance (n.)反对；抵制；抗拒 to this idea.

Blunt: Now why do you think this is? Surely having a Granny about the place *to take care of* the younger children, and *give a hand with* the housework, can *take* a lot of pressure *off* a young wife, can’t it?

Taylor: Yes, I think this is true. But remember the old people themselves are of ten totally *opposed to the idea of* going to live with the young family. And modern houses and flats are very small, much smaller than the sort of homes people used to live in.

Blunt: And when Granny gets very old, then the situation becomes even worse, doesn’t it?

Taylor: Yes, *as long as* 只要……就 old people are able to look after themselves, the system *works (v.) quite well*. But as soon as they need anything in the way of care and attention, the situation becomes very difficult indeed.

Blunt: Well, presumably 大概，可能  *a point comes* when old people *have to* go into a nursing home or something similar.

Taylor: Yes, but it’s not *as simple as* that. Because of improvements in medical science, life expectancy is increasing all the time. *The birth rate* has fallen. This means that an ever smaller working population is having to *provide for* an ever larger number of old people, in need of care and attention. `主` The number of places in old people’s homes provided by the State `系` is strictly limited. There are private nursing homes, but the cost is way out of reach of the average family.

Blunt: And how do you see the situation developing in the future?

Taylor: Well, obviously a lot of money is going to *have to* be spent. But it’s difficult persuading people to do this. There aren’t many votes for politicians in providing nursing homes for elderly.

Blunt: You don’t see a reversal (n.)颠倒；彻底转变；反转；倒置 of this trend, with Granny going back to live with the family.

Taylor: I think this is most unlikely.


面试。 +
欧内斯特·泰勒教授是一位社会学家，著有多本书。他最近在CBC电台接受了诺曼·布朗特的采访。 +
 +
布朗特:教授，在你的新书《奶奶不再住在这里》中，你认为奶奶是个问题，而且将来该问题会变得更大。我说的对吗? +
泰勒:是的，事实上不仅是奶奶有问题，爷爷也有问题，所有的老人都有问题。 +
布朗特:这是英国特有的现象吗?这似乎很可悲，父母应该付出这么多的生命来抚养他们的孩子，然后，当他们老了，被视为一个问题。 +
泰勒:我们的研究主要在英国进行。在许多国家，丧偶的母亲去和她已婚的孩子住在一起, 仍然被认为是很自然的事，但是在英国，当然在过去的三四十年间，这种想法遭到了相当大的抵制。 +
布朗特:你认为这是为什么?当然，有一个奶奶在身边照顾年幼的孩子，帮助做家务，可以减轻年轻妻子的压力，不是吗? +
泰勒:是的，我想这是真的。但是要记住，老人自己通常是完全反对和年轻的家庭住在一起的。现代的房子和公寓都很小，比人们过去住的那种房子小得多。 +
布朗特:当奶奶老了，情况就更糟了，不是吗? +
泰勒:是的，只要老年人能够照顾自己，这个制度就很有效。但是，一旦他们需要任何关心和关注的方式，情况变得非常困难。 +
布朗特:嗯，大概有一天，老人不得不去养老院或类似的地方。 +
泰勒:是的，但事情没那么简单。由于医学的进步，预期寿命一直在增加。出生率下降了。这意味着越来越少的工作人口不得不供养越来越多需要照顾和照顾的老年人。国家提供的养老院的名额是严格限制的。也有私人养老院，但费用超出了普通家庭的承受能力。 +
布朗特:你如何看待未来的形势发展? +
泰勒:嗯，显然要花很多钱。但说服人们这样做很难。在为老年人提供养老院的问题上，政客们没有多少选票。 +
布朗特:你看不到这种趋势的逆转，奶奶会回去和家人住在一起。 +
泰勒:我认为这不太可能。 +
