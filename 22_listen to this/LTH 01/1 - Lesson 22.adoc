== Section 3

===== Dictation.

I have always been interested in making things. When I was a child I used to enjoy painting, but I also liked making things out of clay. I managed to win a prize for one of my paintings when I was fourteen. That is probably the reason that I managed to get into art college four years later. But I studied painting at first, not pottery.  +

I like being a potter because I like to work with my hands and feel the clay; I enjoy working on a potter’s wheel. I’m happy working by myself and being near my home. +
I don’t like mass-produced things. I think crafts and craftspeople are very important.

When I left college I managed to get a grant from the Council, and I hope to become a full-time craftswoman. This workshop is small, but I hope to move to a larger one next year.
