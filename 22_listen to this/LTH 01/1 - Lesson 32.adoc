==== B. Schedule in the Nursing Home.

Mrs. Weston is describing(v.) her schedule in the nursing home.

I usually get up at 6:30. I’ve always been an *early riser*. When my husband was alive, we had to be up by five o’clock. He was a long distance train driver, you see.

Before breakfast I have a cup of tea and I listen to music on the radio. Then between seven and eight I *get dressed* and eat breakfast —a boiled egg and a large glass of orange juice —I never have anything else. Then at eight o’clock I always watch *breakfast television* —for the news and the weather and the chat.

And then I usually *have a nap* until lunch. That’s always at twelve. We have a big lunch here at Twybury’s —soup, *roast meat*, potatoes, vegetables, always a pudding.

After lunch I like being taken out in my wheelchair, or even in a car, if there’s anyone to take me. I hate staying indoors. I like looking in the shop windows, or sitting in a park and watching the world *go by*.

Sometimes someone will read to me or write some letters.

I usually fall asleep about three, and then of course we have our tea around five —nothing heavy —cold meats and salads and fruit, and that kind of thing.

In the evening we play cards, or do knitting, and then I’m in bed by eight. I am *getting on* a bit, you know. I’m nearly eighty-three.

==== B. How to Advertise(v.) for a Bank.


If you ask someone, they’ll say that the bank is where you can *cash a cheque*. But it’s more than that and we have to tell people that in our advertisements. There are several things to think about.

When do you start? I mean at what age. That is the first problem. I think you must start very young. So we said: 'Let’s introduce the name of the bank to children and they will never forget it.'

The next question is this: How do you attract the different age groups? My partner said 'Why don’t we use a gimmick for each age group? Give them *something for nothing* —*money boxes* for young children, T-shirts for teenagers, gold pens for young executives.' That always works.

But what do you give to your best customer? That’s another question. What about leather diaries(n.), for example? Banks are very competitive. How do you think of something new? That’s always a problem.

We were one of the first banks to have *drive-in banks* and to open on Saturdays, but now many banks do. Of course, most banks now offer insurance and travel services, and all the usually *standing order(n.)* and *direct debit* services.

The other thing about advertising is where. Where do you put the ads —on television, of course, but which journals and newspapers? And when and how often? These are questions you have to ask yourself.

standing order 是你给银行下的订单，这个订单是你和银行之间签定的。用来告诉银行定期划款给某个账户，而且每次所划的款项是固定不变的，如房租，宽带包月费等。 +
这里面不是银行付款，银行只是中间人，而是委托人要求银行每月从他账上自动转钱给另一方。
