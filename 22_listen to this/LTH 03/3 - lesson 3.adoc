IBM, following the lead of General Motors, announced today it's pulling out of South Africa. Like General Motors, IBM says it's selling its South African holdings because of the political and economic situation there. Anti-apartheid groups have praised the decision, but the State Department says business pullouts are regrettable. Spokesman Charles Redmond said today the Reagan Administration believes US corporate involvement in South Africa has been a progressive force against apartheid. "We regret any decision to reduce US private sector involvement in South Africa. Such reductions could have harmful effects on black workers, injure the South African economy which has, on the whole, weakened the premises of apartheid and provided a means of improving the living standards and skills of many people otherwise disadvantaged by apartheid, and it might limit the extent of US influence in South Africa." State Department spokesman Charles Redmond. IBM employs some 1,500 people in South Africa. More than fifty black youths were arrested today in Harare, Zimbabwe, when police broke up demonstrations at South African offices and the US embassy. Julie Fredricks
reports. "A group of more than a thousand students and youths caused thousands of dollars of damage by burning and stoning the offices of the South African trade mission, South African Airways, Air Malawi, and the Malawian High Commission. The demonstrators suspected South African complicity in the plane crash that killed Mozambiquan President Machel in South Africa and blamed Malawi for supporting the Pretoria-backed insurgents that are attacking Mozambique. Zimbabwean government officials appealed for calm, and a statement from Prime Minister Mugabe just back from a trip to London is expected tomorrow. For National Public Radio, this is Julie Fredricks in Harare. President Reagan met for about an hour today with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the White House. Kohl is the first European Leader to visit the President since the Reykjavik summit. US officials say Kohl expressed support for the President's SDI program. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is in Washington D.C. for four days of meetings. Among the issues on his agenda are economic relations with the US and Germany's policy towards southern Africa. But today, Kohl's talk with President Reagan was dominated by the recent US-Soviet summit meeting in Iceland. NPR's Brenda Wilson reports. While no major agreement was signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in Reykjavik, the two countries made progress in arms control talks in areas that are a central concern to America's European allies. Those particular areas involve disarmament proposals made in Iceland, affecting medium-range missiles and long-range missiles over which allies have voiced some reservations. This was a major topic of discussion with Chancellor Kohl today, even though his Foreign Minister was briefed by the US Secretary of State only last week. In remarks welcoming Chancellor Kohl, President Reagan sounded a positive note, saying that there was ample reason for optimism. "When the next agreement is finally reached with the Soviet Union, and I say when, not if, it will not be the result of weakness of timidity on the part of Western nations. Instead, it will flow from our strength, realism and unity." The President also explained that achieving such an agreement would depend upon pushing ahead with his Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI, because it offered protection against cheating. But members of NATO, including Germany, have expressed concern that eliminating medium-range missiles in Europe as was proposed in Reykjavik would potentially leave Europe vulnerable to the Soviet shorter-range missiles and greater superiority in conventional forces. They expressed doubts that SDI could make up for those deficiencies. The allies, in particular West Germany, want reductions in medium-range missiles tied to reductions in shorter-range missiles and conventional forces. Chancellor Kohl was expected to press these points and to urge President Reagan to compromise on SDI to keep talks between the US and the Soviets moving. Speaking through an interpreter in his arrival remarks, Kohl did not
mention SDI, "It remains our goal, and I know that I shared with you, Mr. President, to create peace and security with ever fewer weapons. In Reykjavik, thanks to your serious and consistent efforts in pursuit of peace, a major step was taken in this direction. And we must now take the opportunities that present themselves without endangering our defensive capability." After the meeting between Kohl and the President, a senior administration official quoted Kohl as saying that he has always been in favor of the Strategic Defense system.

The business leaders announced plans for a permanent five-million dollar endowment fund, and they also promise to hire any of the students who go on to complete their college educations. Andrew Kaffery of member station WBUR has the report. The Boston business community's involvement in the Boston public school dates back almost twenty years, from work internships to an endowment program for Boston teachers. Business has pumped more than one million dollars into the public schools. Now business leaders say they're ready to make their biggest commitment yet: a multi-million dollar scholarship program that will enable the city's poorest kids to go on to college and to jobs afterward. The program is called Action Center for Educational Services and Scholarships, or ACESS. According to Daniel Cheever, the President of Boston's Wheelock College, ACESS in not a blank check for the eligible graduates. "First We'll help them get as much aid as they can from other sources, and secondly, we'll provide the last dollar scholarship. I should add, of course, they have to qualify for financial aid; that is, we're not handing out money to students who don't need it." The average grant is around five hundred dollars and already the program has given one hundred Boston students more than fifty thousand dollars in scholarship money. Other assistance from the program has helped those students raise more than six hundred thousand dollars in additional financial aid. School officials say this program will help a system where 43% of the students live below the poverty level, and almost half who enter high school drop out. Robert Weaver was on Boston high school graduate who could not afford college. He's in the ACESS program now and will get a degree in airplane mechanics next year from the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. "I got the Pale grant and the state scholarship, but there was still a gap. There was like a twenty-three hundred-dollar gap. Wentworth's total bill was fifty-seven hundred, so I had to fill that amount with working over the summer, my family contribution. I paid for my own books, my own tools, things like that. But without ACESS I wouldn't be where I am today." This program comes at an important time for the city of Boston. Unemployment here is among the lowest in the nation and business leaders say they're having a hard time finding qualified job applicants. So the ACESS program is not just good public relations. Business leaders, like Edward Philips, who is the chairman of the ACESS
program, say there's a bit of self-preservation involved. "Over time, we believe this program will increase the flow of Boston residents into Boston businesses and that, of course, is a self-serving opportunity. If where you are has a supply of qualified people to enter managerial and technical-professional level jobs, that can't be anything but a plus." Philips says any scholarship student who finishes college will be given hiring priority over other job applicants by the participating businesses. College student Robert Weaver says the program has inspired other high school students to stay in school. "I went back to my high school yesterday, Brighton High School, and I talked to a senior class, the general assembly, and I was telling them basically what I'm involved in, and basically, to get yourselves motivated and go look for those ACESS advisers. They're not going to come to you all the time. You have to get out there and get it if you want to take account for your own life, because no one else is going to do it for you. And that really pumped them up, and now that they're aware, and they know that ACESS advisers are there, things will be a lot easier for them." The business group is in the middle of a five-million-dollar fund drive. Two million dollars has already been collected. Thirty-two of Boston's most influential corporations have already joined in, with twenty more soon to follow. The program has drawn the praise of US Education Secretary William Bennett, who predicted it will become a national model. For National Public Radio, I'm Andrew Kaffery in Boston.



IBM 继通用汽车之后，今天宣布退出南非。与通用汽车一样，IBM 表示，由于南非的政治和经济形势，该公司正在出售其在南非的股份。反种族隔离团体赞扬了这一决定，但国务院表示，企业撤出令人遗憾。发言人查尔斯·雷德蒙德今天表示，里根政府相信美国企业对南非的参与是反对种族隔离的进步力量。 “我们对减少美国私营部门在南非的参与的任何决定感到遗憾。这种减少可能对黑人工人产生有害影响，损害南非经济，总体上削弱了种族隔离的前提，并提供了改善生活的手段许多因种族隔离而处于不利地位的人的标准和技能，这可能会限制美国在南非的影响力。”美国国务院发言人查尔斯·雷德蒙德。 IBM 在南非拥有约 1,500 名员工。今天，当警察驱散南非办事处和美国大使馆的示威活动时，津巴布韦哈拉雷有五十多名黑人青年被捕。朱莉·弗雷德里克斯报道。 “一千多名学生和青年组成的团体烧毁了南非贸易代表团、南非航空公司、马拉维航空公司和马拉维高级专员公署的办公室，并用石头砸死了他们的办公室，造成了数千美元的损失。示威者怀疑南非是这起事件的同谋。莫桑比克总统马谢尔在南非坠机身亡，并指责马拉维支持比勒陀利亚支持的袭击莫桑比克的叛乱分子。津巴布韦政府官员呼吁保持冷静，预计明天穆加贝总理刚刚从伦敦访问归来将发表声明。 我是国家公共广播电台的朱莉·弗雷德里克斯，来自哈拉雷。里根总统今天在白宫会见了西德总理赫尔穆特·科尔约一个小时。科尔是雷克雅未克峰会以来第一位拜访总统的欧洲领导人。美国官员称科尔表达了对总统战略防御计划的支持。西德总理赫尔穆特·科尔正在华盛顿特区参加为期四天的会议。他议程上的问题包括与美国的经济关系以及德国对南部非洲的政策。但今天，科尔与里根总统的谈话主要是最近在冰岛举行的美苏峰会。 NPR 的布伦达·威尔逊报道。尽管美国和苏联在雷克雅未克没有签署任何重大协议，但两国在美国欧洲盟友最关心的领域的军控谈判取得了进展。这些特定领域涉及冰岛提出的裁军提议，影响到盟国对此持保留意见的中程导弹和远程导弹。这是今天与科尔总理讨论的一个主要话题，尽管他的外交部长上周才听取了美国国务卿的通报。里根总统在欢迎科尔总理的讲话中表达了积极的态度，称有充分的理由保持乐观。 “当最终与苏联达成下一份协议时，我说的是何时，而不是是否，这将不是西方国家胆怯软弱的结果。相反，它将源于我们的力量、现实主义和团结”。总统还解释说，达成这样的协议将取决于推进他的战略防御计划（SDI），因为它提供了防止作弊的保护。 但包括德国在内的北约成员国表示担心，雷克雅未克提议的消除欧洲中程导弹可能会让欧洲容易受到苏联短程导弹和常规部队更大优势的攻击。他们对 SDI 能否弥补这些缺陷表示怀疑。盟国，特别是西德，希望在削减中程导弹的同时削减短程导弹和常规部队。预计科尔总理将强调这些观点，并敦促里根总统在 SDI 问题上做出妥协，以保持美国和苏联之间的谈判继续进行。科尔在抵达致辞中通过翻译发表讲话，并没有提及战略防御计划，“总统先生，这仍然是我们的目标，我知道我与你分享过，用更少的武器创造和平与安全。在雷克雅未克，感谢你们为追求和平而做出的认真而持续的努力，是朝这个方向迈出的重要一步。我们现在必须抓住出现的机会，而不危及我们的防御能力。”科尔与总统会晤后，一位政府高级官员援引科尔的话说，他一直赞成战略防御系统。在白宫，我是布伦达·威尔逊。波士顿的一群商界领袖今天宣布计划扩大大学奖学金计划，以涵盖任何符合条件的波士顿高中毕业生。商界领袖宣布了设立 500 万美元永久性捐赠基金的计划，他们还承诺雇用任何继续完成大学教育的学生。 WBUR 会员站的安德鲁·卡弗里 (Andrew Kaffery) 收到了这份报告。 波士顿商界对波士顿公立学校的参与可以追溯到近二十年前，从工作实习到波士顿教师的捐赠计划。企业已向公立学校注入了超过一百万美元。现在，商界领袖表示，他们已准备好做出迄今为止最大的承诺：一项数百万美元的奖学金计划，该计划将使该市最贫困的孩子能够继续上大学并随后找到工作。该计划称为教育服务和奖学金行动中心，或 ACESS。波士顿会德丰学院 (Wheelock College) 校长丹尼尔·奇弗 (Daniel Cheever) 表示，对于符合条件的毕业生来说，ACESS 并不是一张空白支票。 “首先，我们将帮助他们从其他来源获得尽可能多的援助，其次，我们将提供最后一美元的奖学金。当然，我应该补充一点，他们必须有资格获得经济援助；也就是说，我们”我们不会把钱分发给不需要的学生。”平均助学金约为五百美元，该项目已经为一百名波士顿学生提供了超过五万美元的奖学金。该计划的其他援助已帮助这些学生筹集了超过六十万美元的额外经济援助。学校官员表示，该计划将帮助一个 43% 的学生生活在贫困线以下、几乎一半进入高中的学生辍学的系统。罗伯特·韦弗 (Robert Weaver) 是波士顿高中毕业生，无法负担大学费用。他现在正在参加 ACESS 项目，明年将从波士顿温特沃斯理工学院获得飞机力学学位。 “我得到了帕莱助学金和国家奖学金，但仍然有差距。大约有两千三百美元的差距。 温特沃斯的账单总额为五千七百美元，所以我必须通过暑假的工作来填补这笔钱，这是我家庭的贡献。我为自己的书、工具等东西付费。但如果没有 ACESS，我就不会取得今天的成绩。” 该计划对波士顿市来说是在一个重要时刻推出的。这里的失业率是全国最低的之一，商界领袖表示他们很难找到合格的工作因此，ACES 计划不仅仅是良好的公共关系。像 ACESS 计划主席爱德华·飞利浦 (Edward Philips) 等商界领袖表示，这其中涉及到一些自我保护。“随着时间的推移，我们相信该计划将增加波士顿居民涌入波士顿企业，这当然是一个自私的机会。如果你所在的地方有足够的合格人才进入管理和技术专业级别的工作，那只能是一个加分。”飞利浦表示，任何完成大学学业的奖学金学生都将比其他求职者获得招聘优先权。大学生罗伯特·韦弗 (Robert Weaver) 表示，该计划激励了其他高中生留在学校。“昨天我回到了我的高中布莱顿高中，我在高年级学生大会上进行了交谈，我很高兴告诉他们我正在参与什么，基本上是为了激励自己去寻找那些 ACESS 顾问。他们不会一直来找你。如果你想为自己的生活负责，你就必须走出去并得到它，因为没有人会为你做这件事。这确实让他们兴奋不已，现在他们意识到了，而且他们知道 ACESS 顾问就在那里，事情对他们来说会容易得多。“该商业集团正在进行一项 500 万美元的资金筹集活动。已经筹集到 200 万美元。波士顿最有影响力的 32 家公司已经加入，很快还有 20 家公司加入。该计划已经吸引了美国教育部长威廉·贝内特 (William Bennett) 的赞扬，他预测它将成为全国典范。我是国家公共广播电台的安德鲁·卡弗里 (Andrew Kaffery)，在波士顿。
