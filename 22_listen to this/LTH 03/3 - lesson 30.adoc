Lesson30


Israeli warplanes raided suspected Palestinian targets in southern Lebanon today, a day after a grenade attack near Jerusalem's Wailing Wall. NPR's Deborah Amis reports. "This afternoon four Israeli jets streaked over the Palestinian refugee camp of Miamia near the south Lebanese town of Sidon within the Palestinian targets. According to reports from Sidon, one Israeli Phantom jet was shot down by a Sam-5 missile during the raid. Two of the crewmen on board parachuted out. One died; the other was captured by Amal, the Lebanese Shi'ite Muslim group. The Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem would only confirm that a raid had taken place in south Lebanon, but wouldn't comment on any of the other details coming from Lebanese reports. Meanwhile in Israel, a government crisis that has riveted the attention of most Israelis was resolved today, but hardly noticed in the unfolding drama of the day's events. In a rotation agreement made by the two major political parties, Yitzhak Shamir will become the new Prime Minister of Israel on Monday. For National Public Radio, this is Deborah Amis in Jerusalem." Nigerian playwright, poet and novelist Wole Soyinka was named today as the first black to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Soyinka has published about twenty works that denounce racism and fascism, and praise everyday man of every color. And at the news conference in Paris today, Soyinka said the award represented world recognition of the long misunderstood culture and traditions of Africa. The winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for Economics was also named today. James Buchanan of George Mason University is recognized for discoveries demonstrating the link between political decisions and a nation's economic performance. Congress approved another emergency funding bill to keep the government operating another day, while lawmakers continued debate on an overall spending package for the year. NPR's Cokie Roberts reports. "Big orange and white buttons reading 'Free the 99th Congress' have sprouted on the lapels all over Capitol Hill. Members of Congress, ready to hit the campaign trail, just don't seem able to get out of Washington. The big five hundred and seventy-six billion dollar spending bill needed to keep the government functioning through this fiscal year is being debated on the Senate floor. The House passed the measure last night. But the other
must-pass piece of legislation, the measure to allow the government to keep borrowing in order to pay its bills, is now not expected before tomorrow. Two other big bills still need one house to act on them. The House passed immigration reform yesterday. The Senate will deal with it tomorrow. The Senate passed a drug bill yesterday and now it looks like it will be tomorrow before that measure reaches the House floor. I'm Cokie Roberts at the Capitol." Israel reacted swiftly today both diplomatically and militarily to a grenade attack in Jerusalem last night. The Palestine Liberation Organization claimed responsibility for the attack from its office in Cairo. Today, according to reports from news agencies in Lebanon, Israeli war planes bombed and shelled a Palestinian refugee camp in south Lebanon. From Jerusalem, Deborah Amis reports. Event unfolded quickly today. According to reports from Lebanon, Israeli jets bombed and shelled Miamia, a Palestinian refugee camp near the Lebanese port city of Sidon. According to witnesses there three civilians were wounded as the planes hit their targets. Sidon and the refugee camp nearby have become a stronghold for Al-Fatah guerrillas, loyal to Yasir Arafat, Chairman of the PLO. The raid today appears to be in retaliation for yesterday's grenade attacks in Jerusalem. Although other groups claimed responsibility throughout the day, the Israeli government chose to take the PLO claim seriously as shown in their choice of targets. According to reports out of Lebanon tonight, an Israeli plane was shot down in the raid, and one crewman was captured; the other one died. The Israeli military spokesman would only confirm that a raid had taken place in south Lebanon, but would not comment on any of the other details. On the diplomatic front earlier today Mohammed Basuni, Egypt's Ambassador to Israel was summoned to the Foreign Ministry. There a senior Israeli official presented him with a formal protest. Basuni was told that the PLO office in Cairo was incompatible with the terms of the peace treaty with Israel. This morning, when the PLO claimed responsibility for the grenade attack in Jerusalem, the statement was made from the Cairo office. Fizo Awada, the PLO representative, was interviewed on Cairo radio. Ambassador Basuni said today that Egypt condemns terrorism and that Egyptian authority has summoned the PLO representative for an explanation. However, the fact that Egypt is the only Arab country to have an Ambassador in Israel and a PLO representative in Cairo presents some problems. Today, some Israeli military authorities were making the semantic distinction on last night's grenade attack. Some called it "a guerrilla attack" rather than "a terrorist one." Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's Prime Minister, said he saw no difference. "Civilians or military, the PLO was out to kill Jews," he said. Clearly, that was the reason for today's raids on Palestinian refugee camps in south Lebanon. For National Public Radio, this is Deborah Amis in Jerusalem. The recipient of this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced today. He is Wole Soyinka, a fifty-two-year-old Nigerian playwright and an author. Soyinka's best
known work in this country is probably Ake , his childhood memoir. Soyinka is the first African and the first black to win the distinguished prize for literature. And he was in Paris today when he heard the news. Melodie Walker reports. Wole Soyinka is in Paris to attend a meeting of International Theatre Institute, a non-governmental organization at UNESCO headquarters. Appearing somewhat annoyed by the crowd of reporters who cornered him in a lounge at UNESCO, the Nigerian writer confessed that he wasn't really prepared for the onslaught of instant Nobel prize fame. "I am not really enjoying it, honestly. It's ... I had no psychological preparation. You know, I'm just into it like that, you know. If I'd had some notice and I'd been able to, you know, prepare myself, you know, like an athlete going into combat, into competition perhaps, but this was rather sudden. You know, really, really sudden, totally unexpected." Soyinka says he accepted the news of the Nobel Prize for Literature with the deep sense of honor, but not for himself alone. He says the award goes beyond his individual work and honors all African writers. "I don't believe in literally prizes. And therefore when I view the literary prize, I tend to see the prize in a much larger context than the individual writer, because how do you judge works of literature? How do you compare works of literature from different cultures? It's an almost impossible task. So certain contradictions must go into the choice of somebody to receive an award of this kind. And that, those contradictions must go outside of the person himself. It has to do with the context. Without any compromise in literary qualities, I do not believe that I'm considered a bad writer; that's why I've been given this prize. No, don't misunderstand me. But I'm saying that it's more than just being an acceptable writer who gives some kind of literary pleasure to discerning, sophisticated people. It goes beyond that. It has to do with the significance of this occasional symbolic event. And it is very much a symbolic event. It's for all the African writers, for even the third would, for even the universal literature, because it opens the universe to the literature not merely of the recipient of the prize, but of the society from which his literature comes. It opens, then, certain nuggets, literary and artistic nuggets which they have taken for granted, which they have relegated to the exotica. So it's a symbolic prize, and I view it as such ..." Wole Soyinka writes poetry, plays and novels in his native Yoruba and in English. He studied theatre in England in the 1950s after attending Leeds University. Then he returned to Nigeria in 1960 to form a highly successful and popular theatre group. His works, including political satire sketches, have been translated into many languages and performed all over the world. Soyinka says he is a writer for the theatre above all else, and he feels perfectly comfortable writing in both his native tribal language as well as in English. "In the history of the world, there have been many writers, in fact, who ended up writing in a language which is not their first language. I think it's possible to evaluate the angst which goes with this kind of imposition, which becomes almost second nature. But I think if one examines the question of translation ... and African, the
works of African writers have been translated into all languages (the works of Chinow Tado, like mine, have been translated into Japanese, Arabic, Russian, Bulgarian, and of course, African languages as well) —then the problem becomes much smaller." Soyinka was reluctant to talk about his work amid the microphones, clicking cameras and glaring TV lights. With a smile, he criticized reporters for preventing him from attending his UNESCO meeting today, and said he hoped to return to Nigeria as soon as possible where he can have some peace and quiet and time to write.

今天，在耶路撒冷哭墙附近发生手榴弹袭击一天后，以色列战机袭击了黎巴嫩南部的可疑巴勒斯坦目标。 NPR 的黛博拉·艾米斯报道。 “今天下午，四架以色列喷气式飞机在巴勒斯坦目标内的黎巴嫩南部城镇西顿附近的迈阿密巴勒斯坦难民营上空掠过。根据西顿的报道，一架以色列“幻影”喷气式飞机在袭击中被萨姆-5导弹击落。两架机上船员跳伞跳伞，一人死亡，另一人被黎巴嫩什叶派穆斯林组织阿迈勒抓获。以色列驻耶路撒冷军方发言人仅证实黎巴嫩南部发生袭击事件，但不予置评来自黎巴嫩报道的任何其他细节。与此同时，在以色列，一场引起大多数以色列人关注的政府危机今天得到了解决，但在当天事件的戏剧性展开中却几乎没有被注意到。在两国达成的轮换协议中主要政党伊扎克·沙米尔将于周一成为以色列新总理。对于国家公共广播电台来说，这是耶路撒冷的黛博拉·艾米斯。尼日利亚剧作家、诗人和小说家沃勒·索因卡今天被任命为第一位获得诺贝尔文学奖的黑人。索因卡出版了大约二十部作品，谴责种族主义和法西斯主义，赞扬各种肤色的普通人。索因卡今天在巴黎举行的新闻发布会上表示，该奖项代表了世界对长期被误解的非洲文化和传统的认可。 1986年诺贝尔经济学奖的获得者也于今天揭晓。乔治梅森大学的詹姆斯·布坎南因证明政治决策与国家经济表现之间的联系的发现而受到认可。 国会批准了另一项紧急拨款法案，以使政府继续运转，而立法者则继续就今年的总体支出方案进行辩论。 NPR 的 Cokie Roberts 报道。 “国会山各地的翻领上都出现了写着‘解放第 99 届国会’的橙色和白色大纽扣。准备好参加竞选活动的国会议员们似乎无法离开华盛顿。五百强参议院正在讨论维持政府在本财年正常运作所需的 760 亿美元支出法案。众议院昨晚通过了这项法案。但另一项必须通过的立法，即允许政府继续借贷以支付账单，现在预计明天之前不会。另外两项重大法案仍需要众议院采取行动。众议院昨天通过了移民改革。参议院明天将处理它。参议院通过了一项药物昨天的法案，现在看起来该措施要到明天才能到达众议院。我是国会大厦的科基·罗伯茨。”今天，以色列对昨晚耶路撒冷发生的手榴弹袭击事件做出了迅速的外交和军事反应。巴勒斯坦解放组织驻开罗办事处声称对此次袭击负责。今天，据黎巴嫩通讯社报道，以色列战机轰炸了黎巴嫩南部一处巴勒斯坦难民营。黛博拉·艾米斯在耶路撒冷报道。今天事件进展很快。据黎巴嫩报道，以色列战机轰炸了黎巴嫩港口城市西顿附近的巴勒斯坦难民营迈阿密亚。据目击者称，飞机击中目标时造成三名平民受伤。 西顿和附近的难民营已成为效忠巴解组织主席亚西尔·阿拉法特的法塔赫游击队的据点。今天的袭击似乎是对昨天耶路撒冷发生的手榴弹袭击的报复。尽管其他组织全天声称对此事负责，但以色列政府选择认真对待巴解组织的声明，这一点从他们对目标的选择中可见一斑。据黎巴嫩今晚报道，一架以色列飞机在袭击中被击落，一名机组人员被俘；另一个死了。以色列军方发言人仅证实黎巴嫩南部发生了袭击，但不会评论任何其他细节。在外交方面，今天早些时候埃及驻以色列大使穆罕默德·巴苏尼被传唤到外交部。一名以色列高级官员向他提出正式抗议。巴苏尼被告知巴解组织驻开罗办事处不符合与以色列签订的和平条约的条款。今天上午，巴解组织声称对耶路撒冷的手榴弹袭击负责，这一声明是从开罗办事处发表的。巴解组织代表菲索·阿瓦达接受开罗电台采访。巴苏尼大使今天表示，埃及谴责恐怖主义，埃及当局已传唤巴解组织代表作出解释。然而，埃及是唯一在以色列设有大使并在开罗设有巴解组织代表的阿拉伯国家，这一事实带来了一些问题。今天，一些以色列军事当局对昨晚的手榴弹袭击进行了语义区分。一些人称其为“游击队袭击”，而不是“恐怖分子袭击”。以色列总理伊扎克·沙米尔表示，他认为没有什么区别。 “无论是平民还是军人，巴解组织都是为了杀害犹太人，”他说。 显然，这就是今天袭击黎巴嫩南部巴勒斯坦难民营的原因。我是国家公共广播电台的黛博拉·艾米斯，在耶路撒冷。今年的诺贝尔文学奖获奖者今天揭晓。他就是 Wole Soyinka，一位五十二岁的尼日利亚剧作家和作家。索因卡在这个国家最著名的作品可能是他的童年回忆录《阿克》。索因卡是第一位获得该杰出文学奖的非洲人和第一位黑人。今天他听到这个消息时正在巴黎。梅洛迪·沃克报道。沃勒·索因卡 (Wole Soyinka) 正在巴黎参加联合国教科文组织总部的非政府组织国际戏剧学院的会议。这位尼日利亚作家似乎对被一群记者把他困在联合国教科文组织休息室里感到有点恼火，他承认自己并没有真正准备好迎接诺贝尔奖的瞬间名声。 “老实说，我并不是很喜欢它。这是......我没有任何心理准备。你知道，我只是喜欢那样，你知道。如果我有一些注意并且我能够做到，你知道，做好准备，你知道，就像一名运动员进入战斗，也许进入比赛，但这相当突然。你知道，真的非常突然，完全出乎意料。”索因卡表示，他怀着深深的荣誉感接受了诺贝尔文学奖的消息，但不仅仅是为了他自己。他说，该奖项超越了他的个人作品，向所有非洲作家致敬。 “我不相信字面上的奖项。因此，当我看待文学奖时，我倾向于在比单个作家更大的背景下看待该奖项，因为你如何评判文学作品？你如何比较不同作家的作品不同文化的文学作品？这几乎是一项不可能完成的任务。 因此，选择某人获得此类奖项必然存在一定的矛盾。而且，这些矛盾必须超出人本身的范围。这与上下文有关。在不影响文学品质的情况下，我不认为我是一个糟糕的作家；这就是我获得这个奖项的原因。不，别误会我的意思。但我想说的是，这不仅仅是成为一个可以接受的作家，为眼光敏锐、经验丰富的人们带来某种文学乐趣。它超出了这一点。这与这个偶然的象征性事件的重要性有关。这在很大程度上是一个具有象征意义的事件。这是为了所有非洲作家，甚至是第三个作家，甚至是普世文学，因为它不仅向获奖者的文学开放了宇宙，而且向其文学来源的社会开放了文学的宇宙。然后，它打开了某些他们认为理所当然的金块，文学和艺术金块，他们将其归为异国情调。所以这是一个象征性的奖项，我认为它是这样的......”沃勒·索因卡用他的祖国约鲁巴语和英语创作诗歌、戏剧和小说。他在利兹大学毕业后于 20 世纪 50 年代在英国学习戏剧。然后他于 2017 年返回尼日利亚。 1960年组建了一个非常成功和受欢迎的剧团。他的作品，包括政治讽刺小品，被翻译成多种语言并在世界各地演出。索因卡说，他是一名戏剧作家，最重要的是，他感到非常舒服他既用他的母语部落语言也用英语写作。“事实上，在世界历史上，有许多作家最终都用非母语的语言进行写作。 我认为可以评估这种强加所带来的焦虑，这几乎成为第二天性。但我认为，如果我们审视一下翻译问题……以及非洲，非洲作家的作品已经被翻译成所有语言（奇诺多多的作品，就像我的一样，已经被翻译成日语、阿拉伯语、俄语、保加利亚语和当然，还有非洲语言）——那么问题就小得多了。”索因卡不愿意在麦克风、摄像机的咔嗒声和刺眼的电视灯光下谈论他的工作。他微笑着批评记者阻止他参加联合国教科文组织会议今天，他说他希望尽快返回尼日利亚，在那里他可以享受一些平静和安静，并有时间写作。我是国家公共广播电台，我是巴黎的梅洛迪·沃克。
