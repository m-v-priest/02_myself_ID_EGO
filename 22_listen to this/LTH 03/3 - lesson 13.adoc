Lesson13


A special committee of twelve senators today began the impeachment trial of Federal Judge Harry Claiborne. It's the first such proceeding in fifteen years. Claiborne is serving a jail sentence for tax evasion. President Reagan today continued his campaign for a drug-free America. He ordered mandatory testing for federal workers in sensitive positions. And he also sent Congress a legislative package that would increase federal anti-drug spending by nine hundred million dollars, much of that on increased border patrols. The President said the legislation is the federal government's way of just saying no to drugs. "We're getting tough on drugs; we mean business. To those who are thinking of using drugs, we say 'Stop.' And to those who are pushing drugs, we say 'Beware.'" Mandatory drug testing for some federal workers is the most controversial part of the President's plan. It's been condemned by some employee groups. One person was killed and more than fifty injured today in Paris when a bomb exploded at the drivers' permit office at police headquarters. It was the fourth blast in seven days in the French capital. In Paris today, one person was killed and more than fifty were injured when a bomb exploded at police headquarters. This is the fourth attack on a crowded public target in a week. A police officer was killed yesterday while removing a bomb from a restaurant on the Avenue Champs Elysee. Minutes after that incident, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac announced new security measures aimed at curbing terrorist activities in France. Melodie Walker reports from Paris. A group calling itself "the Committee for Solidarity with Arab and Middle-Eastern Prisoners" has claimed responsibility for the current series of bombings in Paris, in addition to ten other attacks in the French capital over the past year. The Committee has delivered messages to news agencies in Beirut threatening to continue its bombing campaign in Paris until the French government agrees to release three men jailed in France on charges of terrorism. One of the convicted prisoners, George Ibraham Abdullah, is believed to be the leader of the Lebanese Army Faction suspected of killing a US Military Attache in Paris in 1982. The French government has officially declared it will not release the prisoners. In response to the repeated attacks in Paris, Prime Minister Chirac last night announced new anti-terrorist measures: military patrols along the French borders will be increased and, beginning today, all foreigners will require a visa to enter France. Citizens of European Common Market countries and Switzerland will be exempt from the visa requirement. But
Americans planning to visit France will need to apply for visas at the nearest French consulate. For an initial period of fifteen days, however, emergency visas will be granted at French airports and other border checkpoints. France has been plagued with terrorism at home and abroad in recent years. In the past two weeks, three French members of the United Nations peace keeping force in Lebanon have been killed by remote-controlled bombs. Today, France called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the role and safety of the force. Seven French hostages in Beirut are also a major concern for the Chirac government. Dominique Moazi, Associate Director of the French Institute for International Relations, says the bombings in Paris, the attacks on the UN troops, and the hostage situation are all indirectly related. "I think there is a global goal, which is looked after, and that is to punish France for its involvement in Middle-Eastern affairs, either Lebanon or the war between Iran and Iraq. And France is, at the same time, more visible than any other European actors, in Lebanon and in the Gulf." According to Moazi, the long French tradition of granting political asylum has made France more open and accessible to terrorist activities. "In the past we have given, unfortunately, the impression, which was maybe a reality, of being less resolute in our treatment of terrorist action than, for example, the Israelis. So that combination of visibility, vulnerability, and lack of resolution has made us the ideal target for terrorists now." In a statement released today, President Francois Mitterand said, "The fight against terrorism is the business of the entire nation." But despite the government's determination to combat terrorism, the question of how to do it remains unanswered. For National Public Radio, this is Melodie Walker in Paris. The United States Senate Intelligence Committee today released a report calling for sweeping changes in US security policies and counter-intelligence, its first unclassified assessment of recent spy cases the Committee says the damage done has cost billions of dollars, threatening America's security as never before. NPR's David Malthus has the story. The report states that damage done from espionage and lax security is worse than anyone in the government has yet acknowledged publicly. It concludes that US military plans and capabilities have been seriously compromised, intelligence operations gravely impaired. US technological advantages have been overcome in some areas because of spying. And diplomatic secrets were exposed to adversaries. Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy is Vice-Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "The national security is many times threatened more by this than by the buildup of Soviet arms, of the buildup of Soviet personnel, or breakthrough in weapon development." The Committee report says foreign intelligence services have penetrated some of the most vital parts of US defense, intelligence, and foreign policy structures. The report
cites a string of recent cases, including the Walker-Whitworth spy ring, which gave the Soviets the ability to decode at least a million military communications. Despite some improvements by the Reagan Administration in security and tough talk over the last two years, the report also concludes that the administration has failed to follow through with enough specific steps to tighten security, and that its counter-intelligence programs have lacked the needed resources to be effective. Republican Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, sums up the current situation this way: "Too many secrets, too much access to secrets, too many spies, too little accountability for securing our national secrets, and too little effort given to combating the very real threat which spies represent to our national security." Senator Durenberger said the Committee found some progress has been made in toughening up security clearances for personnel, and some additional resources have been devoted to countering technical espionage, but he said much more needs to be done and he described the current security system as one "paralyzed by bureaucratic inertia." The Committee makes ninety-five specific recommendations, including greater emphasis on re-investigations of cleared personnel, a streamlined classification system, more money for counter-intelligence elements of the FBI, CIA and the military services, and tighter controls on foreign diplomats from hostile countries. The report cites FBI assessments on how extensively the Soviets use diplomatic cover to hide spying activity. There are twenty-one hundred diplomats, UN officials, and trade representatives from te Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries living in the United States. And according to the FBI, 30% of them are professional intelligence officers. The Committee report also says the Soviet Union is effectively using United Nations organizations worldwide to conduct spying operations. It says approximately eight hundred Soviets work for UN agencies, three hundred of them in New York, and one fourth of those are working for the KGB or the Soviet military intelligence, the GRU. Next week, the Reagan Administration is to deliver to the Congress its classified report on counter-intelligence. I'm David Malthus in Washington.



由十二名参议员组成的特别委员会今天开始对联邦法官哈里·克莱伯恩进行弹劾​​审判。这是十五年来的第一次此类诉讼。克莱伯恩因逃税正在监狱服刑。里根总统今天继续他的无毒美国运动。他下令对敏感职位的联邦工作人员进行强制检测。他还向国会提交了一项立法计划，将联邦禁毒支出增加九亿美元，其中大部分用于增加边境巡逻。总统表示，这项立法是联邦政府对毒品说不的方式。 “我们对毒品越来越严厉；我们是认真的。对于那些考虑吸毒的人，我们说‘停止’。”对于那些推销毒品的人，我们说‘当心’。”对一些联邦工作人员进行强制药物检测是总统计划中最具争议的部分。此举遭到了一些员工团体的谴责。今天，巴黎警察总部驾照办公室发生炸弹爆炸，造成一人死亡、五十多人受伤。这是法国首都七天内的第四次爆炸。今天在巴黎，一枚炸弹在警察总部爆炸，造成一人死亡、五十多人受伤。这是一周内第四次针对拥挤的公共目标的袭击。昨天，一名警察在香榭丽舍大街一家餐厅拆除炸弹时被杀。事件发生几分钟后，法国总理雅克·希拉克宣布了新的安全措施，旨在遏制法国境内的恐怖活动。梅洛迪·沃克从巴黎报道。 一个自称“声援阿拉伯和中东囚犯委员会”的组织声称对巴黎目前发生的一系列爆炸事件以及去年法国首都发生的其他十起袭击事件负责。该委员会已向贝鲁特的新闻机构发出信息，威胁要继续在巴黎进行轰炸行动，直到法国政府同意释放因恐怖主义罪名而在法国被监禁的三名男子。其中一名被定罪的囚犯乔治·易卜拉汉·阿卜杜拉据信是黎巴嫩陆军派别领导人，涉嫌于1982年在巴黎杀害一名美国武官。法国政府已正式宣布不会释放这些囚犯。针对巴黎频频发生的袭击事件，希拉克总理昨晚宣布了新的反恐措施：将加强法国边境沿线的军事巡逻，并且从今天开始，所有外国人进入法国都需要签证。欧洲共同市场国家和瑞士的公民将免除签证要求。但计划访问法国的美国人需要在最近的法国领事馆申请签证。不过，在最初的十五天期限内，法国机场和其他边境检查站将发放紧急签证。近年来，法国国内外深受恐怖主义困扰。过去两周，联合国驻黎巴嫩维和部队的三名法国成员被遥控炸弹炸死。今天，法国呼吁联合国安理会召开紧急会议，讨论部队的作用和安全。贝鲁特的七名法国人质也是希拉克政府的主要担忧。 法国国际关系研究所副所长多米尼克·莫阿齐表示，巴黎爆炸事件、联合国部队遇袭事件以及人质事件都有间接关系。 “我认为有一个受到关注的全球目标，那就是惩罚法国参与中东事务，无论是黎巴嫩还是伊朗和伊拉克之间的战争。同时，法国也更加引人注目。”在黎巴嫩和海湾地区，比任何其他欧洲参与者都要多。”莫阿齐表示，法国给予政治庇护的悠久传统使法国对恐怖活动更加开放和容易。 “不幸的是，过去我们给人的印象是，我们在对待恐怖主义行动方面不如以色列人那么坚决，这也许是现实。因此，可见性、脆弱性和缺乏解决方案的结合，使我们现在成为恐怖分子的理想目标。”弗朗索瓦·密特朗总统在今天发布的一份声明中表示：“打击恐怖主义是整个国家的事情。”但尽管政府决心打击恐怖主义，但如何打击恐怖主义的问题仍然没有答案。我是国家公共广播电台的梅洛迪·沃克 (Melodie Walker)，在巴黎。美国参议院情报委员会今天发布了一份报告，呼吁彻底改变美国的安全政策和反情报政策，这是该委员会对近期间谍案件的首次非保密评估，称造成的损失已达数十亿美元，对美国的安全构成了前所未有的威胁。 NPR 的大卫·马尔萨斯讲述了这个故事。报告指出，间谍活动和松懈的安全造成的损害比政府中任何人公开承认的还要严重。 报告的结论是，美国的军事计划和能力已受到严重损害，情报行动也受到严重损害。美国的技术优势在某些领域因间谍活动而被削弱。外交机密被暴露给对手。佛蒙特州民主党人帕特里克·莱希是参议院情报委员会副主席。 “国家安全受到的威胁很多时候比苏联武器的集结、苏联人员的集结或武器开发的突破所受到的威胁更大。”该委员会的报告称，外国情报机构已经渗透到美国国防、情报和外交政策结构中一些最重要的部分。该报告引用了最近发生的一系列案件，其中包括沃克-惠特沃斯间谍团伙，该团伙使苏联有能力破译至少一百万条军事通信。尽管过去两年里根政府在安全方面取得了一些进步，并且发表了强硬言论，但报告还得出结论，政府未能采取足够的具体措施来加强安全，而且其反情报计划缺乏所需的资源才能有效。情报委员会主席、明尼苏达州共和党人戴夫·杜伦伯格这样总结当前形势：“秘密太多，接触秘密的渠道太多，间谍太多，保护国家秘密的责任太少，为保护国家秘密付出的努力太少。”打击间谍对我们国家安全构成的真正威胁。杜伦伯格参议员表示，委员会发现在加强人员安全许可方面已经取得了一些进展，并且已经投入了一些额外资源来打击技术间谍活动，但他表示还有很多工作要做，他将当前的安全系统描述为一个“因官僚惰性而瘫痪。”委员会提出了九十五项具体建议，包括更加重视对已清除人员的重新调查、简化分类系统、为联邦调查局、中央情报局和军事部门的反情报部门提供更多资金，以及对来自敌对国家的外国外交官进行更严格的控制。报告引用了联邦调查局对苏联利用外交掩护来隐藏间谍活动的广泛程度的评估。有 2100 名来自苏联和华沙条约国家的外交官、联合国官员和贸易代表生活在这片土地上。据美国联邦调查局称，其中 30% 是专业情报人员。该委员会的报告还称，苏联正在有效地利用联合国在世界各地的组织进行间谍活动。报告称，大约有八百名苏联人为联合国机构工作，其中三百人在纽约，其中四分之一为克格勃或苏联军事情报机构格鲁乌工作。下周，里根政府将向国会提交有关反情报的机密报告。我是华盛顿的大卫·马尔萨斯。
