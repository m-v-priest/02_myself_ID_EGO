Lesson36


An arbitrator today blocked a National Football League plan to randomly test NFL players for illegal drugs. Arbitrator Richard Casher responding to a grievance filed by the NFL Players Association said the plan violates the players' contract. The Commissioner Pete Rozelle had announced the drug testing proposal in July. It called for two surprise tests during the football season, but Casher said Rozelle lacks the power to implement the plan without going through the collective bargaining process.
NASA today gave an update on its efforts to remodel space shuttle booster rockets. A faulty booster caused the shuttle Challenger to explode in January. NPR's Richard Harris has details. "NASA engineer John Thomas says the rocket testing program is progressing just about on schedule. He says redesign booster rockets should be available for a space shuttle launch in February 1988. Engineers have simulated the exact problem the caused the shuttle disaster in January. They've also started testing the remodeled components. Thomas admitted that testing could take longer if NASA follows the advice of independent engineers at the National Research Council. Those engineers suggested additional tests beyond what NASA has planned. But Thomas said NASA might run some of those tests after the first shuttle flight. For example, NASA might delay tests for unusually hot or cold launch conditions. He said NASA would just make sure the weather was mild at lift-off until those tests were completed. This is Richard Harris in Washington." Religious leaders from around the world joined Pope John Paul II today in a day of prayer for peace. The leaders gathered at the birthplace of Saint Francis of Assisi in Italy to pray according to their own rites. One hundred sixty people representing twelve of the world's major religions gathered today in the central Italian town of Assisi for an unprecedented day of prayer for peace. The initiative was proposed by Pope John Paul II to commemorate the United Nations' International Year of Peace. The Pontiff also appealed for a twenty-four-hour of truce in the world's conflicts, and several revolutionary groups agreed to honor the cease-fire. From Assisi, Sylvia Perjoli reports. The narrow cobblestoned streets and the pink toned medieval churches of Assisi were the backdrop today of one of the most colorful and spectacular events organized by Pope John Paul II since he assumed the Papacy eight years ago. The ceremony spanned eight hours and was divided into three parts. This morning at a basilica outside the town, the Pope received religious leaders representing Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Shintoism, Hinduism, as well as Sikhs, African animists, Byes, Zorastrians, Jane and native Americans. The Pope told his guests, some attired in formal religious robes, others in traditional costumes, that he chose Assisi because of its particular significance as the birthplace of Saint Francis, who is revered as a symbol of peace, reconciliation and brotherhood. For the second moment of the day, each religious delegation went to an assigned place to hold its own prayers. The Jewish delegation convened on the site of a fourteenth-century synagogue. Some groups prayed in Catholic churches, others in municipal buildings, and still others, such as the Shintoists, prayed in squares. The day's final event came this afternoon when the participants who had observed a fast marched in a procession to the square of the Basilica of Saint Francis. The delegates sat on a large podium, the Pope in the center with the Christians and Jews on his right, and the other religions on his left. The final part of the ceremony began
with each group reciting their won prayers in the presence of others. The Buddhists were first. One of the most colorful prayer services was that of the native Americans. John Pretty-on-Top and his nephew Burton of the Crow Indian tribe of Montana wore feathered headdresses and inhaled deeply from a long peace pipe which they offered the great spirit of the Mother Earth. After the prayer, young men and women distributed olive branches while a choir sang a hymn in Greek. The Pope then delivered his elocutions, in which he stressed that despite their differences, the world's religions have a common ground. "Besides, we also make the world looking at us through the media, moreover, of the responsibilities of religion regarding problems of war and peace." The ceremony ended with the release of hundreds of doves as the choir sang "Saint Francis Canticle to Father Sun and Sister Moon." As the ceremony was coming to a close, the Vatican announced that the Pope's appeal for a truce of all conflicts raging throughout the world had been widely respected. The Holy See spokesman said that after an intense diplomatic effort by the Vatican, all guerrilla groups in Latin America with the exception of Peru's Venda Luminosa and various guerrilla groups in Africa and Asia had responded favorably. In the Middle East, the warring factions in Lebanon, as well as PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, also welcomed the appeal. But in Mozambique, Afghanistan, Iran, Vietnam, and some of the Communist guerrillas in the Philippines did not reply or refused to observe a truce. Tomorrow it will be known if the message from the largest gathering of religions was carried out. For National Public Radio, this is Sylvisa Perjoli in Assisi. The "American Century" has become the "American Crisis," and that happened in just twenty-five years. That's the theme of David Halberstam's latest book called The Reckoning . It's the story of the Ford Motor Company and the story of Nissan, a Japanese car maker since the late 1930s. It is now a very successful importer to the US. Basically Halberstam believes the American automobile industry, Detroit since the Second World War, became a shared de facto monopoly failing to listen to congress, failing to notice Japan, and mostly failing, he says, because the car companies came under the control of the financial people rather than the car people. David Halberstam talks with us now about one very important year in auto biz, 1964, and about several important people, beginning with Yutaca Catayama of Nissan. "Catayama, who is a kind of exuberant, somewhat aristocratic man, was very frustrated. At home in Tokyo, there seemed to be no place for him in the company. He loved making cars. He was on the wrong side politically, and that's a very political company. And so he was almost exiled to America on the assumption that selling cars in America would be a sure place: if you wanted someone to fail, that's what you would do. And he came here, and he loved America. I mean, he was more at home, oddly enough, in America than he was in Japan. In the beginning he would almost, I
mean, sell cars hand by hand. He would go to the Japanese gardeners in Los Angeles and sell these little pick-up trucks and he found these, you know, almost used car dealers whom he convinced to be Nissan dealers, and he would hand ... he'd drive the cars down to their lots, and he got to know the business, and just it began to surface in '64. That's a very important demarcation point, 1964." "You mention the pick-up trucks they were trying to sell on the west coast. It is funny the correspondence back and forth between the west coast and Tokyo that the Japanese in Tokyo don't believe that Americans should be riding in pick-up trucks as passenger vehicles and refuse to accommodate some design changes." "Well, factories in those days were not very technologically advanced. I mean, they have this wonderful work force, and they have this enormous ambition and this willingness as to pay a high price. But their cars were very primitive really, like American cars in the '30s. But the truck they were building was like a small tank and was very inexpensive, and they were started selling on the west coast. And for the first couple years, the little truck was what carried the company. I mean that's where they made their inroads. And Catayama kept saying, 'You know, you don't under ...' to the home-office. 'You don't understand Americans. They drive the truck, I mean, pick-up truck. That's a car for them, I mean, they'll work in it, and they'll play in it; they'll go to the bank in it; they'll go to a drive-in movie in it. Can we put some air conditioner? Can we make it more comfortable? Can we put in a radio?' And Tokyo kept saying, you know, 'No, no, no, no. It should not be used for those things. We want the Americans just to drive it as a truck.' You know Catayama just had a feeling that they were losing all these sales. He mostly did not win the battle on the truck, but he won a lot other battles." "Talking about '64, just about the time the Japanese car workers had begun to be able to afford the Japanese car and much earlier in your book, writing about the original Henry Ford, you talk about the time that Ford decided to pay his employees five dollars a day, as been an incredibly revolutionary time in American labor history." "I think that he revolutionized the economy and the idea of the worker as the consumer. I mean if there is a thing called the "American Century,' it is also a thing called the 'Oil Century.' The two are the same, and the coming of the first Henry Ford with the Model T at the very beginning of the century, at the very same time when you have these huge oil gushers down in the Southwest—its spindle top which supplies the inexpensive energy—you begin to get the oil culture. And then very quickly you have small gas engines, and you have items which are consumer items. What Henry ford did was bring mass production and finally create a cycle in which, for the first time, in the industrial would, the worker was also a consumer. And when he paid for the first time five dollars a day, everybody else in the industrial sector jumped on his back, you know, and said, 'he was ruining us.' This would, you know cause all kinds of social chaos, that workers couldn't handle that much money. But he was very skillfully creating this cycle, and he knew that he could build this many cars, but there's no sense in building them if people couldn't buy them. And the worker became the consumer." "Let me ask you for an explanation of this man. His name is Kadsundo Kohamu. This
is a Japanese name given ... taken by an American." "Yes, his name ... well, that means William the Conqueror, I believe, in rough translation. His real name—he was born, I suppose, well, in the other century—is a man named William Reagan Gorham. And he was a wonderful tinker that the kind that we were producing in the very beginning of the twentieth century, men who just loved this moment of explosion of machinery. He was like a Henry Ford, who came along a few years after Ford. In fact, the original Henry Ford was his God. And he was trying to ... and he invented everything; he could do almost everything. And frustrated in America, because there seemed to be no place for him, he went over to Japan to ... originally to design airplanes during World War I. Loved it there. Became kind of a sort of industrial or mechanical missionary there. And he would invent motorized little vehicles. He invented the diesel engines, airplanes, and finally, he really was, in all respects, the inventor of the first Datsun car. I mean, the intriguing thing that this American, because the Japanese are so good at absorbing other people' knowledge, he invented the first Datsun. He came to love Japan. I mean, for him, it was a country loved many of the values, systems of the respect for work, the cleanliness, whatever the country. And he was honored there. He was never interested in making very much money. As Would War II began to approach, he became very melancholy, because he saw his adopted country and his native country about to do go war. He argued, without very much success, on both sides to ... in ways that would sort of cut off the growing confrontation. And on the very eve, he took up Japanese citizenship, this name and told his then colleague sons to go back to America before it was too late. And he is buried there. It is an extraordinary life.

今天，一名仲裁员阻止了国家橄榄球联盟对 NFL 球员进行非法药物随机检测的计划。仲裁员理查德·卡舍尔在回应 NFL 球员协会提出的申诉时表示，该计划违反了球员合同。专员皮特·罗泽尔 (Pete Rozelle) 于 7 月宣布了药物测试提案。它要求在足球赛季期间进行两次突击测试，但卡舍尔表示，罗泽尔缺乏在不经过集体谈判程序的情况下实施该计划的权力。美国宇航局今天公布了其改造航天飞机助推火箭的最新进展。一月份，一个有故障的助推器导致挑战者号航天飞机爆炸。 NPR 的理查德·哈里斯 (Richard Harris) 提供了详细信息。 “美国宇航局工程师约翰·托马斯表示，火箭测试计划正在按计划进行。他说，重新设计的助推火箭应该可用于 1988 年 2 月的航天飞机发射。工程师们已经模拟了 1 月份造成航天飞机灾难的确切问题。他们”我们还开始测试改造后的组件。托马斯承认，如果美国宇航局遵循国家研究委员会独立工程师的建议，测试可能需要更长时间。这些工程师建议在美国宇航局计划之外进行更多测试。但托马斯表示，美国宇航局可能会进行其中一些测试“在第一次航天飞机飞行后。例如，美国宇航局可能会推迟对异常炎热或寒冷的发射条件的测试。他说美国宇航局只会确保升空时天气温和，直到这些测试完成。这是华盛顿的理查德·哈里斯。”今天，来自世界各地的宗教领袖与教皇约翰·保罗二世一起祈祷和平。领导人聚集在意大利阿西西圣方济各的出生地，按照自己的仪式进行祈祷。 今天，代表世界十二个主要宗教的一百六十人聚集在意大利中部小镇阿西西，参加史无前例的和平祈祷日。该倡议是由教皇约翰·保罗二世为纪念联合国国际和平年而提出的。教宗还呼吁在世界冲突中实行二十四小时停火，一些革命团体也同意遵守停火协议。 Sylvia Perjoli 从阿西西报道。今天，狭窄的鹅卵石街道和粉红色的阿西西中世纪教堂成为教皇约翰·保罗二世自八年前就任教皇以来组织的最丰富多彩、最壮观的活动之一的背景。仪式持续八个小时，分为三个部分。今天早上，教皇在城外的一座大教堂接见了代表基督教、犹太教、伊斯兰教、佛教、神道教、印度教以及锡克教徒、非洲万物有灵论者、拜斯教徒、琐拉斯特教徒、简和美洲原住民的宗教领袖。教皇告诉他的客人，一些穿着正式的宗教长袍，另一些则穿着传统服装，他选择阿西西是因为它作为圣方济各的出生地具有特殊的意义，圣方济各被尊为和平、和解与兄弟情谊的象征。当天的第二个时刻，各个宗教代表团前往指定地点进行各自的祈祷活动。犹太代表团在一座十四世纪的犹太教堂旧址上召开会议。一些团体在天主教堂祈祷，另一些团体在市政建筑中祈祷，还有一些团体，例如神道教徒，在广场祈祷。今天下午是当天的最后一场活动，观看了快速行进的参与者列队前往圣弗朗西斯大教堂广场。 代表们坐在一个大讲台上，教皇坐在中间，基督徒和犹太人在他的右边，其他宗教在他的左边。仪式的最后部分开始，每个小组在其他人在场的情况下背诵他们赢得的祈祷文。首先是佛教徒。最丰富多彩的祈祷仪式之一是美洲原住民的祈祷仪式。来自蒙大拿州克罗印第安部落的约翰·普雷蒂-上衣和他的侄子伯顿戴着羽毛头饰，从长长的和平烟斗中深深地吸了一口气，向他们献上了大地母亲的伟大精神。祈祷结束后，年轻男女分发橄榄枝，唱诗班用希腊语唱赞美诗。教宗随后发表演讲，强调世界宗教尽管存在差异，但仍有共同点。 “此外，我们还通过媒体让世界关注我们宗教在战争与和平问题上的责任。”仪式以数百只鸽子被释放而结束，唱诗班唱着“圣弗朗西斯颂歌给太阳父亲和月亮姐妹”。仪式即将结束时，梵蒂冈宣布教皇关于世界各地所有冲突停战的呼吁已得到广泛尊重。罗马教廷发言人表示，经过梵蒂冈的大力外交努力，除秘鲁的“文达·卢米诺萨”游击队以及非洲和亚洲的各个游击队外，拉丁美洲所有游击队都做出了积极回应。在中东，黎巴嫩交战各派以及巴解组织领导人亚西尔·阿拉法特和伊拉克总统萨达姆·侯赛因也对这一呼吁表示欢迎。但莫桑比克、阿富汗、伊朗、越南和菲律宾的一些共产党游击队没有做出答复或拒绝遵守停战协议。 明天就会知道最大的宗教集会所传达的信息是否得到落实。我是国家公共广播电台的西尔维萨·佩尔乔利 (Sylvisa Perjoli)，来自阿西西。 “美国世纪”已经变成了“美国危机”，而这仅仅发生了二十五年。这是大卫·哈尔伯斯坦最新著作《清算》的主题。这是福特汽车公司和 20 世纪 30 年代末以来的日本汽车制造商日产汽车的故事。它现在是美国非常成功的进口商。哈尔伯斯坦基本上认为，自第二次世界大战以来，底特律的美国汽车工业成为了事实上的共同垄断，没有听取国会的意见，没有注意到日本，而且大部分都失败了，他说，因为汽车公司受到了金融机构的控制。人而不是车人。 David Halberstam 现在与我们谈论汽车行业非常重要的一年，即 1964 年，以及几位重要人物，首先是日产汽车公司的 Yutaca Catayama。 “片山是一个精力充沛、有点贵族气质的人，他非常沮丧。在东京的家中，公司里似乎没有他的位置。他喜欢制造汽车。他在政治上站在了错误的一边，这就是一家非常政治化的公司。因此，他几乎被流放到美国，因为他认为在美国销售汽车将是一个肯定的地方：如果你想让某人失败，那就是你会做的。他来到了这里，他热爱美国。我的意思是，奇怪的是，他在美国比在日本更自在。我的意思是，一开始他几乎会手工销售汽车。 他会去洛杉矶的日本园丁那里卖这些小皮卡车，他找到了这些，你知道的，几乎是二手车经销商，他说服他们是日产经销商，然后他会……他会开这些车深入了解他们的情况，他开始了解这个行业，直到 64 年才开始浮出水面。那是一个非常重要的分界点，1964 年。” “你提到了他们试图在西海岸销售的皮卡车。有趣的是，西海岸和东京之间的来回通信，东京的日本人不相信美国人应该乘坐皮卡车作为客车，并且拒绝适应一些设计变更。”那个时代技术还不是很先进。我的意思是，他们拥有出色的劳动力，他们有巨大的野心，也愿意付出高昂的代价。但他们的汽车确实非常原始，就像 30 年代的美国汽车一样。但他们制造的卡车就像一辆小坦克，而且非常便宜，他们开始在西海岸销售。在最初的几年里，小卡车是公司的承载者。我的意思是，这就是他们取得进展的地方。卡塔亚马一直对总部说：“你知道，你不……”。 “你不了解美国人。他们开卡车，我是说，皮卡车。我的意思是，这对他们来说是一辆汽车，他们会在里面工作，他们会在里面玩耍；他们会在里面工作。他们会穿着它去银行；他们会去里面看一场免下车电影。可以加点空调吗？我们可以让它变得更舒服吗？我们可以安装收音机吗？东京一直说，你知道，‘不，不，不，不。它不应该用于那些事情。我们希望美国人把它当作卡车来驾驶。’你知道卡塔山只是有一种感觉，他们正在失去所有这些销售。他大多没有赢得卡车上的战斗，但他赢得了很多其他战斗。”“谈到 64 年，就在日本汽车工人开始能够买得起日本汽车的时候，而且在你的书中更早的时候在写关于最初的亨利·福特的文章时，你谈到了福特决定每天向员工支付五美元的时间，这是美国劳工史上令人难以置信的革命性时刻。”“我认为他彻底改变了经济和劳动观念。工人作为消费者。我的意思是，如果有一个叫做“美国世纪”的东西，那么它也是一个叫做“石油世纪”的东西。两者是相同的，第一辆亨利·福特和 T 型车在本世纪初问世，就在同一时间，西南地区有这些巨大的石油喷井——它的主轴顶部提供廉价的石油。能源——你开始了解石油文化。然后很快你就有了小型燃气发动机，你就有了消费品。亨利·福特所做的是实现大规模生产，并最终创造了一个循环，在这个循环中，第一次，在工业界，工人也是消费者。当他第一次每天支付五美元时，工业部门的其他人都跳到他的背上，你知道，并说，“他正在毁掉我们。”你知道，这会导致各种社会混乱，工人们无法处理那么多钱。但他非常巧妙地创造了这个循环，他知道他可以制造这么多汽车，但如果如果人们买不到它们。工人变成了消费者。” “我想请你解释一下这个人。他的名字叫卡松多·科哈姆。 这是一个日本名字……由美国人取。”“是的，他的名字……嗯，我相信，粗略翻译的意思是征服者威廉。他的真名——我想，嗯，他出生在另一个世纪——是一个名叫威廉·里根·戈勒姆的人。他是一位出色的修补匠，正是我们在二十世纪初培养的那种人，他们只是喜欢机械爆炸的时刻。他就像亨利·福特，比福特晚了几年。事实上，原来的亨利·福特就是他的上帝。他试图……他发明了一切；他几乎可以做任何事情。在美国感到沮丧，因为似乎没有他的位置，他去了日本……最初是在第一次世界大战期间设计飞机。他喜欢那里。在那里成为某种工业或机械传教士。他还发明了小型机动车辆。他发明了柴油发动机、飞机，最后，从各方面来看，他确实是第一辆 Datsun 汽车的发明者。我的意思是，有趣的是，这个美国人，因为日本人非常善于吸收别人的知识，所以他发明了第一个 Datsun。他开始爱上日本。我的意思是，对他来说，这是一个热爱许多价值观、尊重工作、清洁的制度的国家，无论是哪个国家。他在那里受到了荣誉。他从来没有对赚很多钱感兴趣。随着第二次世界大战的临近，他变得非常忧郁，因为他看到他的移居国和他的祖国即将开战。他认为双方都应该……以某种方式阻止日益加剧的对抗，但没有取得很大成功。 就在前夕，他获得了日本公民身份（这个名字），并告诉他当时同事的儿子们在为时已晚之前回到美国。他被埋在那里。这是一个非凡的人生。大卫·哈尔伯斯坦。他的书名叫《清算》。
