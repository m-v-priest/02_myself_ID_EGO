Lesson 9 +

== 1

Catherine has just left school and she wants to find a job. She and her mother have come to speak to the Careers Advisory Officer. +
Listen to their conversation. +
Officer: Oh, come in, take a seat. I'm the Careers Officer. You're Cathy, aren't you? +
Mother: That's right. This is Catherine Hunt, and I'm her mother. +
Officer: How do you do, Mrs Hunt. Hello, Catherine. +
Cathy: Hello. Pleased to meet you. +
Officer: And you'd like some advice about choosing a career? +
Mother: Yes, she would. Wouldn't you, Catherine? +
Cathy: Yes, Please. +
Officer: Well, just let me ask a few questions to begin with. How old are you, Catherine? +
Mother: She's nineteen. Well, she's almost nineteen. She'll be nineteen next month. +
Officer: And what qualifications have you got? +
Mother: Well, qualifications from school of course. Very good results she got. And she's got certificates for ballet and for playing the piano. +
Officer: Is that what you're interested in, Catherine, dancing and music? +
Cathy: Well ... +
Mother: Ever since she was a little girl she's been very keen on her music and dancing. She ought to be a music teacher or something. She's quite willing to train for a few more years to get the right job, aren't you, Catherine? +
Cathy: Well, if it's a good idea. +
Mother: There you are, you see. She's good girl really. A bit lazy and disorganized sometimes, but she's very bright. I'm sure the Careers Officer will have lots of jobs for you. +
Officer: Well, I'm afraid it's not as easy as that. There are many young people these days who can't find the job they want. +
Mother: I told you so, Catherine. I told you shouldn't wear that dress. You have to look smart to get a job these days. +
Officer: I think she looks very nice. Mrs. Hunt, will you come into the other office for a moment and look at some of the information we have there. I'm sure you'd like to see how we can help young people. +
Mother: Yes, I'd love to. Mind you, I think Catherine would be a very nice teacher. She could work with young children. She'd like that. Or she could be a vet. She's always looking after sick animals. +
Officer: I'm afraid there's a lot of competition. You need very good results to be a vet. This way, Mrs. Hunt. Just wait a minute, Catherine. +
* * * +
Officer: There are just one or two more things, Catherine. +
Cathy: Do call me Cathy. +
Officer: OK, Cathy. Are you really interested in being a vet? +
Cathy: Not really. Anyway, I'm not bright enough. I'm reasonably intelligent, but I'm not brilliant. I'm afraid my mother is a bit over-optimistic. +
Officer: Yes, I guessed that. She's a bit overpowering, isn't she, your mum? +
Cathy: A bit. But she's very kind. +
Officer: I'm sure she is. So, you're interested in ballet and music, are you? +
Cathy: Not really. My mother sent me to lessons when I was six, so I'm quite good, I suppose. But I don't think I want to do that for the rest of my life, especially music. It's so lonely. +
Officer: What do you enjoy doing? +
Cathy: Well, I like playing tennis, and swimming. Oh, I went to France with the school choir last year. I really enjoyed that. And I like talking to people. But I suppose you mean real interests — things that would help me to get a job? +
Officer: No. I'm more interested in what you really want to do. You like talking to people, do you? +
Cathy: Oh yes, I really enjoy meeting new people. +
Officer: Do you think you would enjoy teaching? +
Cathy: No, no, I don't really. I was never very interested in school work, and I'd like to do something different. Anyway, there's a teacher training college very near us. It would be just like going to school again. +
Officer: So you don't want to go on training? +
Cathy: Oh, I wouldn't mind at all, not for something useful. I wondered about being a hairdresser — you meet lots of people, and you learn to do something properly — but I don't know. It doesn't seem very worthwhile. +
Officer: What about nursing? +
Cathy: Nursing? In a hospital? Oh, I couldn't do that, I'm not good enough. +
Officer: Yes, you are. You've got good qualifications in English and Maths. But it is very hard work. +
Cathy: Oh, I don't mind that. +
Officer: And it's not very pleasant sometimes. +
Cathy: That doesn't worry me either. Mum's right. I do look after sick animals. I looked after our dog when it was run over by a car. My mother was sick, but I didn't mind. I was too worried about the dog. Do you really think I could be a nurse? +
Officer: I think you could be a very good nurse. You'd have to leave home, of course. +
Cathy: I rather think I should enjoy that. +
Officer: Well, don't decide all at once. Here's some information about one or two other things which might suit you. Have a look through it before you make up your mind.


凯瑟琳刚刚离开学校，她想找一份工作。她和她的母亲来与职业咨询官交谈。 +
听听他们的谈话。 +
官员：噢，请进，请坐。我是职业官员。你是凯茜，不是吗？ +
妈妈：原来如此。这是凯瑟琳·亨特，我是她的母亲。 +
警官：你好，亨特夫人。你好，凯瑟琳。 +
凯茜：你好。很高兴认识你。 +
官员：您想听听有关选择职业的建议吗？ +
母亲：是的，她会的。你不是吗，凯瑟琳？ +
  凯茜： 是的，请。 +
官员：好吧，首先让我问几个问题。你几岁了，凯瑟琳？ +
母亲：她十九岁了。嗯，她快十九岁了。下个月她就十九岁了。 +
官员：那你有什么资格？ +
母亲：嗯，当然是学校的资格证书。她得到了非常好的结果。她还获得了芭蕾舞和钢琴演奏证书。 +
警官：凯瑟琳，舞蹈和音乐是你感兴趣的吗？ +
  凯茜：嗯……​ +
母亲：从小她就非常热衷于音乐和舞蹈。她应该是一名音乐老师什么的。她很愿意再接受几年培训以获得合适的工作，不是吗，凯瑟琳？ +
凯茜：好吧，如果这是个好主意的话。 +
妈妈：你瞧，就在这儿。她真的是个好女孩。有时有点懒惰和杂乱，但她很聪明。我相信职业官员会给你提供很多工作机会。 +
官员：嗯，恐怕没那么容易。现在有很多年轻人找不到自己想要的工作。 +
母亲：我告诉过你了，凯瑟琳。我告诉过你不应该穿那件衣服。如今，你必须看起来很聪明才能找到工作。 +
官员：我觉得她看起来很漂亮。亨特夫人，请您到另一间办公室来一下，看看我们那里有一些信息。我相信您想看看我们如何帮助年轻人。 +
母亲：是的，我很乐意。请注意，我认为凯瑟琳会是一位非常好的老师。她可以和小孩子一起工作。她会喜欢这样的。或者她可以成为一名兽医。她总是照顾生病的动物。 +
官员：恐怕竞争很激烈。你需要非常好的成绩才能成为一名兽医。这边走，亨特夫人。等一下，凯瑟琳。 +
* * * +
警官：还有一两件事，凯瑟琳。 +
凯茜：请叫我凯茜。 +
警官：好的，凯茜。您真的有兴趣成为一名兽医吗？ +
凯茜：不完全是。无论如何，我还不够聪明。我相当聪明，但并不聪明。我担心我妈妈有点过于乐观了。 +
官员：是的，我猜到了。她有点太强势了，不是吗，你的妈妈？ +
凯茜：有一点。但她非常善良。 +
警官：我确信她是。那么，您对芭蕾舞和音乐感兴趣，是吗？ +
凯茜：不完全是。我六岁的时候，我妈妈送我去上课，所以我想我已经很优秀了。但我不认为我想一辈子都这样做，尤其是音乐。太孤独了。 +
官员：你喜欢做什么？ +
凯茜：嗯，我喜欢打网球和游泳。哦，去年我随学校合唱团去了法国。我真的很喜欢这样。我喜欢与人交谈。但我想你指的是真正的兴趣——能帮助我找到工作的东西？ +
官员：不，我更感兴趣的是你真正想做的事情。你喜欢和人说话，是吗？ +
凯茜：哦，是的，我真的很喜欢结识新朋友。 +
官员：你认为你喜欢教书吗？ +
凯茜：不，不，我真的不知道。我对学校作业一向不太感兴趣，我想做一些不同的事情。不管怎样，我们附近有一所师范学院。就像再次上学一样。 +
官员：所以你不想参加训练？ +
凯茜：哦，我一点也不介意，不是为了有用的东西。我想知道成为一名美发师——你会遇到很多人，你学会正确地做一些事情——但我不知道。看起来不太值得。 +
官员：护理呢？ +
凯茜：护理？在医院里？哦，我做不到，我不够好。 +
官员：是的，你是。您在英语和数学方面拥有良好的资格。但这是非常辛苦的工作。 +
凯茜：噢，我不介意。 +
警官：有时这并不令人愉快。 +
凯茜：这也不让我担心。妈妈是对的。我确实照顾生病的动物。当我们的狗被车碾过时，我照顾了它。我妈妈病了，但我并不介意。我太担心那只狗了。你真的认为我可以成为一名护士吗？ +
警官：我认为你可以成为一名非常好的护士。当然，你必须离开家。 +
凯茜：我觉得我应该享受这个。 +
官员：好吧，不要一下子决定所有事情。以下是有关可能适合您的一两件事的一些信息。在你做出决定之前先看一下它。 +

Speaker 1. When I was at university, I was — I was horrified by what had happened to a lot of my friends by the time they reached the end of the course. Having spent their university careers being all the things one is at university — clever, artistic, very noisy — at the end of their time they all seemed to take entry exams for the ... the Civil Service, and there were some of them who went ... huh ... went as low as to go into the Tax Office huh. How grey, how grey, I thought. But now huh. well, look at me! +
Speaker 2. The circular letters I get drive me absolutely mad, from American Express, etc. They're sent to my work address and they're all addressed to Mr. S Andrews! Obviously they found the name on some published list and assumed that anybody who wasn't a secretary must of course be a man. It's stupid really, because the Company does put Mr. or Ms. in front of the names on its departmental lists, but perhaps because they naturally assume it's a man, they're just blind to the women's names amongst the heads of departments. +
Speaker 3. I work in London at er ... a large hospital as a nursing officer. It's erm ... it's what a lot of people call a male nurse, which I think is the most ridiculous term I've ever come across. It ... sort of implies that a nurse ought to be female and that by being male I'm different, but er ... the idea still carries on. The other thing is that people always say 'I suppose you really wanted to be a doctor', just because I'm a man. They can't imagine that I really wanted to be a nurse and that er ... erm ... it wasn't just that I failed to be a doctor. And ... what they don't realize is the work's completely different, you know as a ... a male nurse you've much more contact with the er ... patients and, you know, a long term responsibility for their ... their welfare huh. There's no way I'd want to be a doctor. Well, except for the money of course. +
Speaker 4. Whenever I say I'm a bank manager, half the time people tend to laugh. I've never understood why. I suppose bank managers do have a rather stuffy bourgeois image, but I can't see why it's funny. +
Speaker 5. I'm a sales representative, what used to be called a travelling salesman, and for some reason there's lots of dirty jokes about travelling salesmen. Can't think why. Well, I suppose it's because they tend to travel a lot, you know, a night here, a night there. Well, people get the idea they're not particularly dependable, sort of fly by nights I suppose, you know, wife in every port. But it aint true, I promise you. +
Speaker 6. I'm an apprentice hairdresser. I enjoy the work very much. I'm learning a lot, not just about hair, but how to get along with people. I'm gaining confidence 'cos I never had that at school. I left as soon as I could. I hated it. I remember teachers used to look down on jobs like hairdressing. They were ever so stuck up. They thought that only girls who were a bit dim went in for hairdressing, but I'm not dim at all. If I work hard in the salon and get all my certificates, if I save hard, in a few years I could start my own business, and I'd be earning five times as much as those old bags at school!


演讲者 1. 当我在大学时，我对我的很多朋友在课程结束时所发生的事情感到震惊。他们在大学生涯中度过了大学时的一切——聪明、艺术、非常吵闹——在他们的大学生涯结束时，他们似乎都参加了……公务员部门的入学考试，其中一些人去了...​呵呵...​低至去税务局呵呵。多么灰色，多么灰色，我想。但现在啊。好吧，看着我！ +
发言者 2. 我收到的来自美国运通公司等的通知信让我非常生气。它们被发送到我的工作地址，而且都是写给 S Andrews 先生的！显然，他们在一些公布的名单上找到了这个名字，并认为任何不是秘书的人当然一定是男人。确实很愚蠢，因为公司确实在部门名单的名字前面加上了先生或女士，但也许是因为他们自然地认为是男性，所以他们对部门负责人中女性的名字视而不见。 +
演讲者 3. 我在伦敦一家大型医院工作，担任护理人员。嗯……这是很多人所说的男护士，我认为这是我遇到过的最可笑的术语。它......有点暗示护士应该是女性，而作为男性我就不同，但是呃......这个想法仍然存在。另一件事是，人们总是说“我想你真的想成为一名医生”，只是因为我是个男人。他们无法想象我真的想成为一名护士，而且呃……呃……不仅仅是我没能成为一名医生。而且......他们没有意识到的是工作完全不同，你知道作为一名......一名男护士，你与呃......患者有更多的接触，并且你知道，对他们的......他们的长期责任福利啊。我不可能想当一名医生。好吧，当然除了钱。 +
演讲者 4. 每当我说我是银行经理时，一半的时间人们都会笑。我一直不明白为什么。我想银行经理确实有一种相当古板的资产阶级形象，但我不明白为什么这很有趣。 +
演讲者 5. 我是一名销售代表，以前被称为旅行推销员，不知为什么，有很多关于旅行推销员的黄色笑话。想不出为什么。嗯，我想这是因为他们经常旅行，你知道，在这里住一晚，在那里住一晚。好吧，人们认为他们不是特别可靠，我想，你知道，在每个港口都有妻子在夜里飞行。但这不是真的，我向你保证。 +
演讲者 6. 我是一名学徒美发师。我非常享受这份工作。我学到了很多东西，不仅仅是关于头发，还有如何与人相处。我正在获得自信，因为我在学校从未有过这种自信。我尽快离开了。我讨厌它。我记得以前老师们很瞧不起美发这样的工作。他们总是那么固执。他们以为只有有点迟钝的女孩才去理发，但我一点也不迟钝。如果我在发廊努力工作，拿到所有证书，如果我努力存钱，几年后我就可以自己创业，我的收入将是学校那些旧书包的五倍！ +

Interviewer: Well, we heard some people just now who seem to feel that other people have a wrong idea about the work they do. Do you think this sort of thing is very widespread? +
Sociologist: Oh absolutely. Most jobs or professions seem to have an image or a stereotype attached to them, often much to the irritation of the job holders. But there is a serious point to all this, too, that maybe young people actually choose their careers under the influence of these false images. And certainly, there is evidence that they may even avoid certain careers because they have a negative image. Well, on a large scale, as you can imagine, this could cause problems for whole sectors of the economy. +
Interviewer: Er, you say there's evidence? +
Sociologist: Oh most definitely. There was a survey recently into children's attitudes to different professions. +
Interviewer: How was that done, though? Because, after all, children don't know much about the world of work before they get into it. +
Sociologist: Well, exactly. What the investigators wanted to get at was their impressions and their prejudices. They used a very simple technique. They gave the children twelve pairs of statements. In each pair one statement was positive, the other was its opposite. +
Interviewer: For example? +
Sociologist: Well, for example, 'Such and such a person is likely to be boring or interesting company.' +
Interviewer: I see. What professions did they ask about? +
Sociologist: (laugh) Do you want the whole list? +
Interviewer: Well, why not? +
Sociologist: OK. Here goes. They looked at: physicists, lawyers, economists, accountants, sales representatives, estate agents, biologists, and three types of engineer — mechanical engineers, electrical and civil. The children were asked to say which of the statements was 'most true' about each profession. +
Interviewer: And the results? +
Sociologist: Well, they were rather striking concerning one profession in particular, the poor old engineer. Of all the jobs mentioned, he came out really much worse than you might expect. The vast majority of children (90% in the case of the mechanical engineer), thought that engineering was a 'dirty job'. They also thought the job was of 'low status' and 'subordinate'; that is, the engineer is more likely to take orders than to give them. Oh, and insecure too. The only other person they thought more likely to actually lose his job was the sales representative. But，I must say there were good points too. Engineering was seen to be 'interesting, well paid' work. +
Interviewer: Hmm, not such a rosy picture, really. +
Sociologist: No ... but it got better when the children were asked about how they imagined the engineer as a person. The majority of the children chose positive comments, except that they thought the engineer was likely to be badly rather than well dressed. (laugh) +
Interviewer: Well, what about the other professions, then? Erm ... what came out favourite, for example? +
Sociologist: Oh the lawyer without a doubt. He collected by far the greatest number of positive opinions. The sales representative and then the estate agent were right at the bottom. +
Interviewer: Oh, so the engineers weren't right down there? +
Sociologist: Oh no! The children's ratings put them just above the poor old sales representative all bunched together. Probably the children don't have that much of an idea of their real work. I think they ... (laughs) ... they went by the titles, really, since civil engineer came out top, perhaps the suggestion of the name? +
Interviewer: Oh, I see. You mean that he was a ... a more civilized sort of chap than the others? +
Sociologist: (laughs) Yes, right. Reasonable sounding, isn't it? +
Interviewer: Yes. Quite sensible, I suppose. And I imagine the mechanical engineer came out bottom? +
Sociologist: Absolutely right. In fact 90% of the children associated him with dirty work, as against 76% for the electrical engineer and 68% for the civil engineer. +
Interviewer: And the other professions? +
Sociologist: Well, after the lawyer came the accountant; then the scientists, the physicist first. The economist came just above the engineers. Funnily enough, he was the only one that the majority of children felt would be gloomy rather than cheerful. +
Interviewer: A real sign of the times, that. +
Sociologist: Yes. But I still think the most serious implication of the results of the survey was the children's apparent ignorance of the importance of the engineer's role in society. +
Interviewer: Hmm. +
Sociologist: After all, in most other European countries to be an engineer is to be somebody. And I imagine that this means that many bright children, who might really enjoy the profession and do well in it, probably never consider it, which is a great pity for the country as a whole. We do need good engineers after all.


采访者：嗯，我们刚才听到有些人似乎觉得其他人对他们所做的工作有错误的看法。你认为这种事情很普遍吗？ +
社会学家：哦，当然。大多数工作或职业似乎都带有某种形象或刻板印象，这往往会激怒工作人员。但这一切也有一个严重的问题，也许年轻人实际上是在这些虚假形象的影响下选择了自己的职业。当然，有证据表明，他们甚至可能会因为负面形象而回避某些职业。嗯，从大范围来看，正如你可以想象的那样，这可能会给整个经济部门带来问题。 +
采访者：呃，你说有证据吗？ +
社会学家：哦，绝对是这样。最近有一项调查调查了孩子们对不同职业的态度。 +
采访者：那是怎么做到的呢？因为毕竟，孩子们在进入工作世界之前对工作世界了解不多。 +
社会学家：嗯，确实如此。调查人员想要了解的是他们的印象和偏见。他们使用了一种非常简单的技术。他们给了孩子们十二对陈述。在每一对中，一个陈述是积极的，另一个是相反的。 +
采访者：比如说？ +
社会学家：嗯，例如，“某某人可能是无聊或有趣的伙伴。” +
采访者：我明白了。他们询问了哪些职业？ +
社会学家：（笑）你想要整个名单吗？ +
采访者：嗯，为什么不呢？ +
社会学家：好的。开始。他们考察了：物理学家、律师、经济学家、会计师、销售代表、房地产经纪人、生物学家以及三类工程师——机械工程师、电气工程师和土木工程师。孩子们被要求说出关于每个职业的哪种说法“最真实”。 +
采访者：结果呢？ +
社会学家：嗯，他们对一种职业（尤其是可怜的老工程师）的看法相当引人注目。在提到的所有工作中，他的表现确实比你想象的要糟糕得多。绝大多数孩子（机械工程师占 90%）认为工程是一项“肮脏的工作”。他们还认为这份工作“地位低下”、“从属”；也就是说，工程师更有可能接受命令而不是下达命令。哦，还有没有安全感。他们认为唯一更有可能真正失业的人是销售代表。但是，我必须说也有好的地方。工程被视为“有趣、报酬丰厚”的工作。 +
采访者：嗯，情况确实不太乐观。 +
社会学家：不……​但是当孩子们被问及他们如何想象工程师这个人时，情况变得更好了。大多数孩子都选择了积极的评论，只是他们认为工程师可能穿着很糟糕，而不是穿着得体。 （笑） +
采访者：那么其他职业呢？呃……​例如，最喜欢什么？ +
社会学家：噢，毫无疑问是律师。迄今为止，他收集到的积极意见数量最多。销售代表和房地产经纪人就在最底层。 +
采访者：哦，那么工程师并不在那儿？ +
社会学家：哦不！孩子们的评分略高于那些挤在一起的可怜的老销售代表。孩子们可能对他们真正的工作不太了解。我认为他们……（笑）……他们确实是按照头衔来的，因为土木工程师名列前茅，也许是名字的暗示？ +
采访者：噢，我明白了。你的意思是他是一个……比其他人更文明的人？ +
社会学家：（笑）是的，没错。听起来很合理，不是吗？ +
采访者：是的。我想，相当明智。我想机械工程师会垫底吗？ +
社会学家：完全正确。事实上，90% 的孩子将他与肮脏的工作联系起来，而 76% 的孩子认为他是电气工程师，68% 的孩子认为他是土木工程师。 +
采访者：其他职业呢？ +
社会学家：嗯，律师之后是会计师；然后是科学家，首先是物理学家。经济学家的地位略高于工程师。有趣的是，他是唯一一个大多数孩子觉得阴沉而不是快乐的人。 +
采访者：这是时代的真正标志。 +
社会学家：是的。但我仍然认为调查结果最严重的影响是孩子们显然不了解工程师在社会中角色的重要性。 +
  面试官：嗯。 +
社会学家：毕竟，在大多数其他欧洲国家，成为一名工程师就意味着成为一个重要人物。我想这意味着许多聪明的孩子，他们可能真的喜欢这个职业并且做得很好，可能永远不会考虑它，这对整个国家来说是一个很大的遗憾。毕竟我们确实需要优秀的工程师。 +

1. Bartering is the process by which trade takes place through the exchange of goods. +
2. Whereas in the past, seashells and spices had no specific value, this new money idea had a stated value. +
3. However, due to recent economic developments, the world is once again conducting trade by bartering goods for goods. +
4. We refer to the more valuable currency as hard currency while we term the less valuable money, soft currency. +
5. In fact, hard currency is usually demanded by the seller, particularly if the seller is from a nation having hard currency. +
6. Inflation refers to an abnormally rapid increase in prices. +
7. As a result of the scarcity of hard currency in some nations and the recent high world-wide inflation, it is obvious that the conventional method of payment in hard currency must be supplemented by other types of payment such as bartering. +
8. Not only is the following illustration a good example of bartering, it also reveals, to a small degree, consumer preferences in beverages in the USSR and the United States. +
9. It seems that Pepsi-Cola was the first company to introduce cola into the USSR, much to the disappointment of Coca-Cola. +
10. Of course, bartering presents some great problems that are not always easy to overcome.


易货贸易是通过货物交换进行贸易的过程。 +
过去，贝壳和香料没有特定的价值，而这种新的货币理念却具有明确的价值。 +
然而，由于最近的经济发展，世界再次通过以物易物的方式进行贸易。 +
我们将价值较高的货币称为硬通货，而将价值较低的货币称为软通货。 +
事实上，卖方通常会要求硬通货，特别是如果卖方来自拥有硬通货的国家。 +
通货膨胀是指物价异常快速上涨。 +
由于一些国家硬通货的稀缺以及最近全球范围内的高通胀，显然传统的硬通货支付方式必须辅以其他形式的支付，例如易货贸易。 +
下图不仅是易货贸易的一个很好的例子，它还在一定程度上揭示了苏联和美国消费者对饮料的偏好。 +
百事可乐似乎是第一家将可乐引入苏联的公司，这让可口可乐非常失望。 +
当然，易货贸易带来了一些并不总是容易克服的重大问题。 +

== 5. How to Make Wine +

This is how wine is made in our winery. After the grapes are picked in late summer, they are pressed so that all the juice runs out. Then the juice is separated from the skins and pips and it is put into large containers and left to ferment. Later, it is put into smaller containers. Then it is left for about a year when it is put into bottles. If it is a good wine, the bottles are kept for several years but the cheaper wines are sold immediately.


如何酿酒 +
我们的酒庄就是这样酿造葡萄酒的。夏末采摘葡萄后，将其压榨，使汁液全部流出。然后将果汁与果皮和果核分离，放入大容器中发酵。随后，将其放入较小的容器中。然后将其装瓶后放置约一年。如果是好酒，瓶子会保存几年，但更便宜的酒会立即出售。 +

== 6. Alan Simpson +

The mystery of the man found wandering in the city centre has now been solved. The man, whose name is now known to be Alan Simpson, is a medical student. Mr. Simpson was taking part in an experiment conducted by the university department of psychology, when he walked away, unnoticed by the staff supervising the experiment. He has now regained his memory, and has left hospital. Several people, including his sister, April Simpson, telephoned the police to identify Mr. Simpson after seeing his picture in the press.


艾伦·辛普森 +
这名在市中心徘徊的男子的谜团现已解开。该男子现名为艾伦·辛普森 (Alan Simpson)，是一名医科学生。辛普森先生当时正在参加大学心理学系进行的一项实验，当他走开时，监督实验的工作人员并没有注意到。目前，他已恢复记忆，并已出院。包括他的妹妹阿普丽尔·辛普森在内的几个人在媒体上看到辛普森先生的照片后，打电话给警方确认了辛普森先生的身份。 +
