Lesson 8 +


== 1

Interviewer: We continue with the World of Investigation. Laura, an identical twin, has agreed to contribute to our investigations. I must apologize for the fact that Laura's twin cannot be here tonight. And I'd like to tell you, Laura, how sorry we are. You and your sister are very close, aren't you? +
Laura: Of course we are. +
Interviewer: Interesting! You said 'of course'. Don't you think there are quite a few sisters who aren't close? +
Laura: Sarah and I aren't just sisters. We're identical twins. +
Interviewer: I take your point. How identical are you, in fact? +
Laura: Both blonde, with brown eyes. Same height, same weight, same size. Even shoes. +
Interviewer: As you're the same size, have you always dressed alike? +
Laura: Oh yes. I'm told it started when we were babies. Mum made a feature of her twins. And then we got into the habit of buying two of everything. +
Interviewer: And you've never minded having a double identity? I mean ... another person exactly like you? +
Laura: Sarah isn't exactly like me. We may look identical, but. I remember our boyfriends couldn't tell us apart. +
Interviewer: Didn't that cause problems? +
Laura: For them, perhaps. Not for us. We couldn't stop laughing. +
Interviewer: I think you said you and Sarah weren't exactly alike? Just what did you mean by that? +
Laura: Sarah has a well-fed happy husband and four healthy children. When she was washing up, I was learning to type. When she was knitting, I was writing articles for the school newspaper. When she was having her second child, I was in Panama, doing my first job for United Information Services. See what I mean? +
Interviewer: And haven't you got a healthy husband and happy children? +
Laura: You must be joking. There's never been the time ... or the inclination. +
Interviewer: Laura, you've made some very interesting points. I gather that you don't feel that behaviour is purely genetic ... that there might be some element of environment or choice or even perhaps ... +
Laura: Shall I conclude? Sarah and I are identical twins ... in appearance, that is ... but it's a fact that life has presented us with different opportunities, so we've led very different lives.


采访者：我们继续调查世界。劳拉是同卵双胞胎，她同意参与我们的调查。我必须为劳拉的双胞胎今晚不能来这里而道歉。劳拉，我想告诉你，我们非常抱歉。你和你姐姐很亲密，不是吗？ +
劳拉：我们当然是。 +
采访者：有趣！你说“当然”。你不觉得关系不太好的姐妹不少吗？ +
劳拉：莎拉和我不仅仅是姐妹。我们是同卵双胞胎。 +
采访者：我同意你的观点。事实上，你们有多相似？ +
劳拉：都是金发女郎，棕色眼睛。相同的身高、相同的体重、相同的尺寸。甚至鞋子。 +
采访者：由于你们体型相同，所以你们总是穿得一样吗？ +
劳拉：哦，是的。我听说它从我们还是婴儿的时候就开始了。妈妈给她的双胞胎做了一个特写。然后我们就养成了每样东西都买两件的习惯。 +
采访者：你从来不介意有双重身份？我的意思是……​另一个和你一模一样的人？ +
劳拉：莎拉和我不太一样。我们可能看起来很相似，但是。我记得我们的男朋友无法区分我们。 +
采访者：这没有带来问题吗？ +
劳拉：也许对他们来说。不适合我们。我们忍不住笑了。 +
采访者：我想你说过你和莎拉不完全一样？你这是什么意思？ +
劳拉：莎拉有一个吃饱喝足、幸福快乐的丈夫和四个健康的孩子。她洗碗的时候，我正在学打字。当她编织的时候，我正在为校报写文章。当她生第二个孩子时，我在巴拿马，为联合信息服务公司做我的第一份工作。明白了吗？ +
采访者：那你没有一个健康的丈夫和幸福的孩子吗？ +
劳拉：你一定是在开玩笑。从来没有时间……​也没有兴趣。 +
采访者：劳拉，你提出了一些非常有趣的观点。我猜你不认为行为纯粹是遗传的……​可能有一些环境或选择的因素，甚至可能……​ +
劳拉：我可以总结一下吗？莎拉和我是同卵双胞胎……从外表上看……但事实上，生活给了我们不同的机会，所以我们过着截然不同的生活。 +

Alan and Barbara have just read an article about twins and coincidences. They are discussing the article over lunch. Listen to their discussion. +
Alan: That idea about our genetic make-up is rather frightening, isn't it? +
Barbara: Do you mean the idea that because of our genetic make-up we are bound to act in a particular way? +
Alan: Yes. If it's true, then it suggests that criminals are born and not made. +
Barbara: Not necessarily. It would only mean that somebody was born with the potential to become a criminal. +
Alan: How do you mean? +
Barbara: Well, if somebody was born with a particular set of genes that made him a potential criminal, it would be necessary for him to be brought up in a particular way if he was actually going to become a criminal. +
Alan: He'd have to grow up in a family of criminals, you mean? +
Barbara: Yes, in the sort of family that regarded crime as a way of life and saw the police as the enemy. +
Alan: They say it takes a thief to catch a thief. +
Barbara: What do you mean by that? +
Alan: Well, I suppose I mean that similar qualities are necessary to become a successful criminal or a first-class policeman. +
Barbara: That's a bit hard on the policeman, isn't it? +
Alan: I don't think so. In time of war men who might easily be in jail win medals for gallantry. +
Barbara: That's because they're the sort of men who aren't satisfied with a normal everyday job. +
Alan: Yes, they're men who get bored with ordinary life and want action. They're usually pretty strong characters, too.


艾伦和芭芭拉刚刚读了一篇关于双胞胎和巧合的文章。他们正在午餐时讨论这篇文章。听听他们的讨论。 +
艾伦：关于我们基因构成的想法相当可怕，不是吗？ +
芭芭拉：你的意思是说，由于我们的基因构成，我们注定会以特定的方式行事？ +
艾伦：是的。如果这是真的，那就表明罪犯是天生的，而不是后天养成的。 +
芭芭拉：不一定。这仅意味着某人生来就有成为罪犯的潜力。 +
艾伦：你这是什么意思？ +
芭芭拉：嗯，如果一个人生来就有一组特定的基因，使他成为潜在的罪犯，那么如果他真的要成为一名罪犯，就必须以特定的方式抚养他。 +
艾伦：你是说，他必须在一个犯罪家庭中长大？ +
芭芭拉：是的，在那种将犯罪视为一种生活方式并将警察视为敌人的家庭中。 +
艾伦：他们说贼要抓贼。 +
芭芭拉：你这是什么意思？ +
艾伦：嗯，我想我的意思是，要成为一名成功的罪犯或一流的警察，必须具备类似的品质。 +
芭芭拉：这对警察来说有点难，不是吗？ +
艾伦：我不这么认为。在战争时期，那些很容易入狱的人会因为英勇而获得奖章。 +
芭芭拉：那是因为他们是那种对正常的日常工作不满意的人。 +
艾伦：是的，他们是厌倦了平凡的生活并想要采取行动的人。他们通常也是非常坚强的角色。 +

== 4. Night Flight +

'This is Captain Cook speaking. Our estimated time of arrival in Brisbane will be one am, so we've got a long flight ahead of us. I hope you enjoy it. Our hostesses will be serving dinner shortly. Thank you.' +
 +
It was Christmas Eve 1959, and the beginning of another routine flight. The hostesses started preparing the food trays. A few of the passengers were trying to get some sleep, but most of them were reading. There was nothing to see from the windows except the vast blackness of the Australian desert below. There was nothing unusual about the flight, except perhaps that the plane was nearly full. A lot of the passengers were travelling home to spend Christmas with their families. The hostesses started serving dinner. +
 +
It was a smooth and quiet flight. The hostesses had finished collecting the trays, and they were in the galley putting things away when the first buzzers sounded. One of the hostesses went along the aisle to check. When she came back she looked surprised. 'It's amazing,' she said. 'Even on a smooth flight like this two people have been sick.' +
 +
Twenty minutes later nearly half the passengers were ill — dramatically ill. Several were moaning and groaning, some were doubled up in pain, and two were unconscious. Fortunately there was a doctor on board, and he was helping the hostesses. He came to the galley and said, 'I'd better speak to the captain. This is a severe case of food poisoning. I think we'd better land as soon as possible.' 'What caused it?' asked one of the hostesses. 'Well,' replied the doctor, 'I had the beef for dinner, and I'm fine. The passengers who chose the fish are ill.' The hostess led him to the flight deck. She tried to open the door. 'I think it's jammed,' she said. The doctor helped her to push it open. The captain was lying behind the door. He was unconscious. The co-pilot was slumped across the controls, and the radio operator was trying to revive him. +
 +
The doctor quickly examined the two pilots. 'They just collapsed,' said the radio operator. 'I don't feel too good myself.' 'Can you land the plane?' said the doctor. 'Me? No, I'm not a pilot. We've got to revive them!' he replied. 'The plane's on automatic pilot. We're OK for a couple of hours.' 'I don't know,' said the doctor. 'They could be out for a long time.' 'I'd better contact ground control,' said the radio operator. The doctor turned to the hostess. 'Perhaps you should make an announcement, try to find out if there's a pilot on board.' 'We can't do that!' she said, 'It'll cause a general panic.' 'Well, how the hell are we going to get this thing down?' said the doctor. +
 +
Suddenly the hostess remembered something. 'One of the passengers ... I overheard him saying that he'd been a pilot in the war. I'll get him.' She found the man and asked him to come to the galley. 'Didn't you say you used to be a pilot?' she asked. 'Yes ... why? The pilot's all right, isn't he?' She led him to the flight deck. They explained the situation to him. 'You mean, you want me to fly the plane?' he said. 'You must be joking. I was a pilot, but I flew single-engined fighter planes, and that was fifteen years ago. This thing's got four engines!' +
 +
'Isn't there anybody else?' he asked. 'I'm afraid not,' said the hostess. The man sat down at the controls. His hands were shaking slightly. The radio operator connected him to Air Traffic Control. They told him to keep flying on automatic pilot towards Brisbane, and to wait for further instructions from an experienced pilot. An hour later the lights of Brisbane appeared on the horizon. He could see the lights of the runway shining brightly beyond the city. Air Traffic Control told him to keep circling until the fuel gauge registered almost empty. This gave him a chance to get used to handling the controls. In the cabin the hostesses and the doctor were busy attending to the sick. Several people were unconscious. The plane circled for over half an hour. The passengers had begun to realize that something was wrong. 'What's going on? Why don't we land?' shouted a middle aged man. 'My wife's ill. We've got to get her to hospital!' A woman began sobbing quietly. At last the plane started its descent. Suddenly there was a bump which shook the plane. 'We're all going to die!' screamed a man. Even the hostesses looked worried as panic began to spread through the plane. 'It's all right!' someone said. 'The pilot's just lowered the wheels, that's all.' As the plane approached the runway they could see fire trucks and ambulances speeding along beside the runway with their lights flashing. There was a tremendous thump as the wheels hit the tarmac, bounced twice, raced along the runway and screeched to a halt. The first airport truck was there in seconds. 'That was nearly a perfect landing. Well done!' shouted the control tower. 'Thanks,' said the man. 'Any chance of a job?'


夜间飞行 +
“这是库克船长在讲话。我们预计抵达布里斯班的时间是凌晨 1 点，所以我们还有一段长途飞行。我希望你喜欢它。我们的女主人很快就会准备晚餐。谢谢。' +
那是 1959 年的圣诞节前夕，也是另一次例行飞行的开始。女主人开始准备餐盘。一些乘客想睡觉，但大多数人都在看书。从窗户里看不到任何东西，除了下面澳大利亚沙漠的广阔黑暗之外。这次飞行并没有什么异常，除了飞机几乎满员之外。许多乘客正在回家与家人一起度过圣诞节。女主人开始准备晚餐。 +
这是一次平稳而安静的飞行。女服务员们已经收拾好了托盘，当第一声蜂鸣器响起时，她们正在厨房里收拾东西。一位女主人沿着过道去查看。当她回来时，她显得很惊讶。 “太棒了，”她说。 “即使是在这样顺利的航班上，两个人还是生病了。” +
二十分钟后，近一半的乘客病了——病得很重。有几个人在呻吟，有些人痛苦地弯下腰，还有两个人失去知觉。幸运的是，船上有一名医生，他正在帮助女主人。他来到厨房说：“我最好和船长谈谈。”这是一起严重的食物中毒事件。我认为我们最好尽快着陆。” “是什么造成的？”一位女主人问道。 “嗯，”医生回答道，“我晚餐吃了牛肉，我很好。”选择这些鱼的乘客病了。”女主人领着他来到了驾驶舱。她试图打开门。 “我认为它被卡住了，”她说。医生帮她把它推开。船长躺在门后。他失去知觉了。副驾驶倒在了驾驶台上，无线电操作员正试图让他苏醒。 +
医生迅速对两名飞行员进行了检查。 “他们就这样倒塌了，”无线电操作员说。 “我自己感觉不太好。” “你能让飞机降落吗？”医生说。 '我？不，我不是飞行员。我们必须让他们复活！他回答。 “飞机处于自动驾驶状态。我们几个小时都没事。” “我不知道，”医生说。 “他们可能会缺席很长一段时间。” “我最好联系地面控制人员，”无线电操作员说。医生转向女主人。 “也许你应该发布公告，尝试查明机上是否有飞行员。” “我们不能那样做！”她说，“这会引起普遍的恐慌。” “那么，我们到底要怎样才能把这东西弄下来呢？”医生说。 +
突然，女主人想起了什么。 “其中一名乘客……我无意中听到他说他曾在战争中当过飞行员。我会去找他的。她找到了那个男人并请他到厨房来。 “你不是说你曾经是一名飞行员吗？”她问。 “是的……​为什么？飞行员没事吧？她把他带到了驾驶舱。他们向他解释了情况。 “你的意思是，你想让我驾驶飞机？”他说。 '你一定是在开玩笑。我是一名飞行员，但我驾驶的是单引擎战斗机，那是十五年前的事了。这东西有四个引擎！ +
“没有其他人了吗？”他问。 “恐怕不行，”女主人说。那人在控制台旁坐下。他的双手在微微颤抖。无线电操作员给他接通了空中交通管制。他们告诉他继续使用自动驾驶仪飞往布里斯班，并等待经验丰富的飞行员的进一步指示。一小时后，布里斯班的灯光出现在地平线上。他可以看到跑道上的灯光在城市之外闪闪发光。空中交通管制告诉他继续盘旋，直到燃油表显示几乎空了。这给了他一个习惯操作控制的机会。船舱里，女主人和医生正忙着照顾病人。几个人都昏迷不醒。飞机盘旋了半个多小时。乘客们开始意识到有些不对劲。 '这是怎么回事？我们为什么不着陆？一名中年男子喊道。 “我妻子病了。我们必须送她去医院！”一个女人开始小声抽泣。飞机终于开始下降。突然，一阵颠簸使飞机摇晃起来。 “我们都会死！”一个男人尖叫道。随着恐慌开始在飞机上蔓延，就连空姐们也显得很担心。 '没关系！'有人说。 “飞行员只是放下了轮子，仅此而已。”当飞机接近跑道时，他们看到消防车和救护车在跑道旁边飞驰，灯光闪烁。当车轮撞上停机坪时，发出一声巨大的撞击声，弹跳了两次，沿着跑道飞驰，然后嘎吱嘎吱地停了下来。第一辆机场卡车几秒钟就到了。 “这几乎是一次完美的着陆。做得好！'控制塔喊道。 “谢谢，”那人说。 “有工作机会吗？” +

== 5

1. Thousands of people die of heart attacks every year; heart disease is becoming so widespread that we can almost talk of an epidemic. +
2. That is, people with heart disease often show one or more of these traits. +
3. The answer is, a person's personality determines that he or she will be likely to develop this illness. +
4. They set themselves unrealistic goals and force themselves to meet impossible deadlines. +
5. Eventually their responses to life become less creative, more automatic, and all of their activities are performed under stress. +
6. In the past, men have tended to show Type A behaviour more than women have, but with an increasing number of women entering the labour force, this also may change. +
7. Stress seems to be caused by our highly technical, highly rushed modern way of life. +
8. Now it is not uncommon for a sixty or fifty or even a forty-year-old to suffer a heart attack. +
9. Too preoccupied with his own schedule, he has little capacity to concentrate on what other people are saying — unless, of course, they are talking about work. +
10. When he returns to work, he finds that the leisure time of the night before has helped him find a creative solution to his work problems.

每年有数千人死于心脏病；心脏病变得如此普遍，以至于我们几乎可以说是一种流行病。 +
也就是说，患有心脏病的人经常表现出这些特征中的一种或多种。 +
答案是，一个人的性格决定了他或她有可能患上这种疾病。 +
他们给自己设定了不切实际的目标，并强迫自己在不可能的期限内完成任务。 +
最终，他们对生活的反应变得不那么有创造力，更加自动化，他们的所有活动都是在压力下进行的。 +
过去，男性比女性更倾向于表现出 A 型行为，但随着越来越多的女性进入劳动力市场，这种情况也可能会改变。 +
压力似乎是由我们高度技术化、高度匆忙的现代生活方式造成的。 +
现在，六十岁、五十岁甚至四十岁的人患心脏病已是屡见不鲜。 +
由于过于专注于自己的日程安排，他几乎没有能力关注其他人在说什么——当然，除非他们在谈论工作。 +
当他回到工作岗位时，他发现前一天晚上的闲暇时间帮助他找到了解决工作问题的创造性方法。 +

== 6 The Boy Who Cried Wolf +

Once upon a time there was a very naughty shepherd boy. He often fell asleep while he was watching his sheep. And he told lies. The villagers shook their heads and said, 'That boy will come to a bad end.' +
 +
One day, when he was feeling very bored, the boy decided to play a practical joke on the villagers. He ran down the hill. 'Wolf, wolf!' he cried. 'Help, come quickly. Wolf!' All the villagers seized their spears and ran to help him. But there was no wolf. 'He heard you,' the naughty boy lied, 'and ran away.' When everyone had gone, he started to laugh. +
 +
Three weeks later, when he was feeling very bored indeed, he decided to play the same trick again. 'Wolf, wolf!' he shouted. 'Help, come quickly. Wolf!' Most of the villagers hurried to help him. This time the boy laughed at them. 'Ha, ha. There wasn't a wolf,' he said. 'What a good joke!' The villagers were very angry. 'Lies are not jokes,' they said. +
 +
Two days later the boy woke up suddenly. He had fallen asleep in the afternoon sun. What was that big dark animal coming towards his flock? Suddenly it seized a lamb. 'Wolf!' screamed the boy. 'Wolf. Help, come quickly. Wolf!' But none of the villagers came to help him. He screamed again. The wolf heard him and licked its lips. 'I like lamb,' it thought, 'but shepherd boy tastes much nicer.' +
 +
When the shepherd boy didn't come home that night, some of the villagers went to look for him. They found a few bones.

狼来了的男孩 +
从前，有一个非常顽皮的牧童。他常常在看着羊群时睡着了。他还撒谎了。村民们纷纷摇头说道：“这孩子的下场不会太好。” +
有一天，当他感到非常无聊时，男孩决定对村民们开一个恶作剧。他跑下山。 “狼，狼！”他哭了。 ‘救命啊，快点过来。狼！'村民们纷纷拿起长矛，跑去帮助他。但没有狼。 “他听到了你的声音，”顽皮的男孩撒谎道，“然后就跑掉了。”当所有人都走了之后，他开始大笑。 +
三周后，当他确实感到非常无聊时，他决定再玩同样的把戏。 “狼，狼！”他喊道。 ‘救命啊，快点过来。狼！'大多数村民赶紧上前帮助他。这次男孩嘲笑他们。 '哈哈。没有狼，”他说。 “多好的笑话啊！”村民们非常愤怒。 “谎言不是笑话，”他们说。 +
两天后，男孩突然醒来。他在午后的阳光下睡着了。那个向他的羊群走来的黑色大动物是什么？突然，它抓住了一只小羊。 '狼！'男孩尖叫道。 '狼。帮忙，快点来。狼！'但没有一个村民来帮助他。他再次尖叫起来。狼听到了他的话，舔了舔嘴唇。 “我喜欢羊肉，”它想，“但是牧童的味道更好。” +
那天晚上，牧童没有回家，一些村民就去找他。他们发现了一些骨头。
