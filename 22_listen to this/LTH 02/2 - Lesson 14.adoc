Lesson 14 +

== 1

Here is a summary of the news.  No general election yet says the Prime Minister.  Five people die in an earthquake in central Italy.  And ￡1/4 million is stolen from a security van. +
 +
In a speech in the city of London last night, the Prime Minister announced that there will be no general election in the near future. Talk of a quick election was pure speculation, she said. A general election would be held when it was in the best interests of the nation to do so. +
 +
In central Italy, several small towns and villages are still cut off by avalanches following the earthquake during the night which killed five people. It was central Italy's strongest earthquake for several years and hundreds of people have been made homeless. In Rome, as well as in Florence, Naples and Perugia, gas pipes were broken, windows shattered and electric cables thrown onto the streets. +
 +
Thieves got away with almost ￡1/4 million after a security van was ambushed in central London early this morning. The security van was rammed by a lorry as it was taking a short cut through a narrow street off Piccadilly. Three masked men then threatened the driver and his assistant with shotguns and forced one of them to unlock the van. The thieves made their escape in a car parked nearby. This car was later found abandoned in south London. The driver of the van and his assistant were badly shaken but not seriously hurt. +
 +
The flight recorder of the DC10 airliner which crashed in the Antarctic a fortnight ago has shown that the plane was flying normally just before impact. All two hundred and fifty-seven people on board the aircraft died when it hit the side of a volcano. The investigation into what happened is still going on. +
 +
Voting is taking place today in the Euro-Constituency of London SouthWest. This by election for the European Parliament is being held because of the death of the previous member, Mr. Harold Friend. At the last election Mr. Friend had a majority of 17,000 over his nearest opponent. +
 +
Talks on a formula for ending the strike at Independent Television get under way in London this afternoon. Looking forward to the meeting, the General Secretary of the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians, Mr. Albert Tapper, said it was taking place on the basis of new proposals from the companies. He hoped it would lead to a basis for negotiations but he refused to speculate on the chances of success. +
 +
Fifteen people are to appear in court in Manchester today, following disturbances on a train bringing football supporters back from matches in London. Eye witnesses report that the trouble began when groups of rival supporters whose teams had both been playing London clubs began to insult each other. After fighting had broken out police boarded the train just outside Manchester and arrests were made. British Rail have announced that they are considering withdrawing all soccer specials operating from Manchester.


以下是新闻摘要。总理表示尚未举行大选。意大利中部地震造成五人死亡。一辆保安车上的 1/400 万英镑被盗。 +
首相昨晚在伦敦市发表讲话时宣布，近期不会举行大选。她说，有关快速选举的言论纯粹是猜测。当符合国家最大利益时才会举行大选。 +
在意大利中部，夜间地震造成五人死亡后，一些小镇和村庄仍因雪崩与外界隔绝。这是意大利中部多年来最强烈的地震，数百人无家可归。在罗马、佛罗伦萨、那不勒斯和佩鲁贾，煤气管被破坏，窗户被震碎，电缆被扔到街上。 +
今天凌晨，一辆保安车在伦敦市中心遭到伏击，窃贼偷走了近四百万英镑。这辆安全车在抄近路穿过皮卡迪利大街附近的一条狭窄街道时被一辆卡车撞上。随后，三名蒙面男子用猎枪威胁司机和他的助手，并强迫其中一人打开货车的锁。窃贼乘坐停在附近的一辆汽车逃跑了。这辆车后来被发现遗弃在伦敦南部。货车司机和他的助手受到严重震动，但伤势并不严重。 +
两周前在南极坠毁的DC10客机的飞行记录显示，飞机在撞击前飞行正常。飞机撞向火山一侧时，机上 257 人全部遇难。对所发生事件的调查仍在进行中。 +
投票今天在伦敦西南部的欧洲选区进行。由于前任议员哈罗德·弗兰德先生去世，欧洲议会举行补选。在上次选举中，弗兰德先生以 17,000 票的多数票击败了最接近的对手。 +
今天下午，关于结束独立电视台罢工方案的谈判在伦敦开始。电影、电视和联合技术人员协会秘书长阿尔伯特·塔珀先生对这次会议充满期待，他表示会议是根据各公司的新提案举行的。他希望这能为谈判奠定基础，但他拒绝猜测成功的机会。 +
今天，在将足球支持者从伦敦比赛带回的火车上发生骚乱后，15 人将在曼彻斯特出庭。目击者称，当双方球队都在伦敦俱乐部比赛的敌对支持者群体开始互相侮辱时，麻烦就开始了。战斗爆发后，警察在曼彻斯特郊外登上火车并逮捕了一些人。英国铁路公司宣布，他们正在考虑撤回从曼彻斯特运营的所有足球特价列车。 +

Interviewer: Tell me Mrs. Clark, how did you come to be a bearded lady? +
Mrs. Clark: Well, it all began when I started growing a beard. +
Interviewer: Mm ... and when was that exactly? +
Mrs. Clark: Just after my fourth birthday, I believe. +
Interviewer: Really? As early as that? Didn't you see a doctor? +
Mrs. Clark: Oh, yes, my parents took me to dozens of specialists. +
Interviewer: And what did they have to say? +
Mrs. Clark: They just told me to shave. +
Interviewer: That's all the advice they could give? So you started shaving? +
Mrs. Clark: Well, I was too young to be allowed to use a razor, and electric razors weren't even thought of in those days, so my dad used to shave me once a week before going to church on Sundays. +
Interviewer: And when did you stop shaving? +
Mrs. Clark: Oh, that would have been when I was around fifteen. You see it was growing at an enormous rate, something like five inches a day, I mean you could almost see it growing, and it was so thick. I mean a razor or scissors were no use. +
Interviewer: So you ... let it grow? +
Mrs. Clark: Well, it was taking so much time trying to keep it down and I was just wasting my time fighting a losing battle. So I thought ... I'll just let it grow ... and that's when I came to work in the circus. I was spotted by a talent scout. +
Interviewer: Do you ... ever cut your beard now? +
Mrs. Clark: Oh, yes every week I chop off a few feet. I have to cut it or I fall over it if I don't remember to wrap it around my waist. +
Interviewer: (Laughs) What about the circus? How did you find it at first, being stared at all day? +
Mrs. Clark: Well, I must admit it was a bit unnerving at first ... what with people gaping at you as though you were a goldfish in a bowl. I used to feel like saying. 'It's all right, dear, it's not that unusual, you know. It's only a bit of extra hair. It's not another head or something.' But you get used to the pointing and laughing in the end. Don't hardly notice it any more. Even the jokes don't upset me now. It's a bit boring in fact, after thirty years, just sitting here all day being stared at. But still there's always the breaks. and then the Ten-Foot Woman and the Midget from next door come in for a cup of tea and a chat, that passes the time nicely. +
Interviewer: Would you say there were any advantages to having a fifteen-foot long beard? +
Mrs. Clark: Well, my husband says it keeps his toes warm on cold nights.


采访者：告诉我克拉克女士，您是如何成为一名留胡子的女士的？ +
克拉克夫人：嗯，这一切都是从我开始留胡子开始的。 +
采访者：嗯……​那具体是什么时候？ +
克拉克夫人：我想，就在我四岁生日之后。 +
采访者：真的吗？这么早？你没去看医生吗？ +
克拉克夫人：哦，是的，我父母带我去看了几十位专家。 +
采访者：他们都说了些什么？ +
克拉克夫人：他们只是叫我刮胡子。 +
采访者：他们能提供的建议就这些吗？所以你开始刮胡子了？ +
克拉克夫人：嗯，我太小了，不能使用剃须刀，那时候甚至没有想到电动剃须刀，所以我爸爸每周日去教堂之前每周给我刮一次胡子。 +
采访者：那你什么时候停止刮胡子的？ +
克拉克夫人：哦，那是我十五岁左右的时候。你看它正在以惊人的速度生长，大约每天五英寸，我的意思是你几乎可以看到它在生长，而且它是如此厚。我的意思是剃刀或剪刀没有用。 +
采访者：所以你……​让它生长？ +
克拉克夫人：嗯，我花了很多时间试图控制住它，而我只是在浪费时间去打一场必败的仗。所以我想……我会让它成长……就在那时我开始在马戏团工作。我被星探发现了。 +
采访者：你……现在剪过胡子吗？ +
克拉克夫人：哦，是的，我每周都会砍掉几英尺。我必须把它剪掉，否则如果我不记得把它缠在腰上，我就会摔倒。 +
采访者：（笑）马戏团呢？整天被人盯着看，你一开始是怎么发现的？ +
克拉克夫人：嗯，我必须承认一开始有点令人不安……人们目瞪口呆地看着你，就好像你是碗里的金鱼一样。我曾经觉得很想说。 “没关系，亲爱的，你知道，这并不是什么不寻常的事情。这只是一点额外的头发。这不是另一个头或什么东西。但最终你会习惯别人的指指点点和大笑。几乎不再注意到它了。现在即使是笑话也不会让我心烦意乱。事实上，三十年后，整天坐在这里被人盯着，有点无聊。但仍然总会有中断。然后隔壁的十英尺女人和侏儒进来喝杯茶聊天，很好地打发了时间。 +
采访者：你觉得留着十五英尺长的胡子有什么好处吗？ +
克拉克夫人：嗯，我丈夫说这能让他的脚趾在寒冷的夜晚保持温暖。 +

Paul: Anyone want another Coke or something? +
James: I think we're all drinking Paul ... thanks just the same. +
Darley: I was thinking ... What would you youngsters do without the youth centre? You'd be pretty lost, wouldn't you? +
Paul: Huh! It's all right I suppose. But I'm telling you ... we don't need no bloody youth club to find something to do. Me ... well ... I only come when there's a dance on. Them berks what come all the time ... well ... they need their heads examined. If I want to drink ... well there's the pub, isn't there. +
Mrs. Brent: But how old are you Paul? Sixteen? You can't drink in pubs — it's illegal. +
Paul: No barman's ever turned me out yet. Anyway ... thanks for the drink. What about a dance, Denise? +
Denise: I don't mind. +
Paul: Come on then. +
Finchley: Er ... Would you care to dance, Mrs. Brent? +
Mrs. Brent: Thank you ... but no. The music isn't of my generation. You know ... the generation gap. When I was young I'd never have dared speak as Paul just did. Especially with a clergyman present. +
James: What sort of world do you think we live in Mrs. Brent? It's part of my job to know people ... and especially young people ... as they are. +
Mrs. Brent: Please don't misunderstand me. I only thought it offensive. If my own son ... +
James: Oh, I'm used to it. In a sense I feel it's a kind of compliment that ... +
Darley: Compliment? +
James: Don't get me wrong. Paul feels free to express himself with me just as he would with his friends. He accepts me as a kind of friend. +
Finchley: And really the so-called generation gap is a myth you know. Teenagers aren't really so different. As a teacher I find them quite traditional in their attitudes. +
Darley: But look at the way they dress ... and their hair! +
James: You haven't got the point I think. Those things are quite superficial. I agree with Mr. Finchley ... Basically their attitudes are very similar to those of my generation. +
Darley: So you approve of the kind of language we heard from Paul just now ... +
James: Now I didn't say that. Anyway the concepts of 'approval' and 'disapproval' tend to over simplify matters. Every generation creates its ... its own special language ... just as it creates its own styles in clothes and music. +
Mrs. Brent: It's just that ... er ... the styles and habits of today's teenagers are so ... well basically ... so unacceptable. +
Finchley: You mean unacceptable to you. +
Mrs. Brent: No ... I mean unacceptable to the rest of society. +
Darley: When you come to think of it ... I mean I'm always on at my boy about his clothes ... +
James: So you find them unacceptable too. +
Darley: No ... just let me finish. I was about to say that in fact his clothes are very practical ... very simple. +
Finchley: Anyway ... the generation gap is non-existent. I mean ... the idea of teenagers ... of a teenage generation that ... which has rejected the values of its parents for a sort of mixture of violence and lethargy ... well ... it's totally unrealistic. +
Mrs. Brent: I do wish you had a teenage son or daughter of your own, Mr. Finchley. +
Finchley: But I have more contact with them ... +
Mrs. Brent: I'm not implying that you have no understanding of their problems. +
Finchley: My contact with them ... as a teacher of English ... is close. You see we have regular discussions ... and they very often carry on after school and here at the youth centre. You'd find them interesting. You could come and sit in sometime if you like. +
Darley: That'd be interesting. +
Mrs. Brent: I'd be too embarrassed to say anything. +
Finchley: I don't mean there's any need for you to take part in the discussion. Just listen. And you'd realize I think just how traditional their attitudes are. +
James: For example? +
Finchley: For example ... you probably wouldn't think so but the majority have ... a firm belief in marriage ... and in the family. +
Darley: Those are things I've never talked about with my boy. +
Finchley: And one very clear ... very notable thing is that they're always looking for opportunities to help others ... +
Mrs. Brent: Well, Tony doesn't help much in the house ... +
Finchley: ... to help others that is who really need help. Not just helping with the washing-up, Mrs. Brent. Anyway ... another point that's come out of the discussions is that nearly all of them — about 90 per cent I should say — get on well with their parents. +
Mrs. Brent: Oh but I ... +
Finchley: Most disagreements seem to be over hair and general appearance. +
James: And we've called those superficial. +
Finchley: Exactly. +
Darley: I like the idea of sitting in on a discussion. I'll take you up on that. +
Finchley: Fine. And Mrs Brent. As you would find it embarrassing ... +
Mrs. Brent: Well I ... I didn't really mean embarrassing. It's just that ... you know ... +
Finchley: There's a book you ought to read ... published by The National Children's Bureau. It's called Britain's Sixteen-Year-Olds. I'll lend you my copy. +
Mrs. Brent: That's very kind of you. Look, I'd better be going. From the way my son's dancing he'll be at it all night. +
Darley: Have you got a car, Mrs. Brent? +
Mrs. Brent: No. There's a bus. +
Darley: Then please let me give you a lift. +
Mrs. Brent: I wouldn't want to take you out of your way. +
Darley: Not at all. Anyway ... we have to take an example from the youngsters, don't we? Helping those in need I mean ... Well ... we'll say good night ... +
Voices: Good night.


保罗：有人想要再来一杯可乐什么的吗？ +
詹姆斯：我想我们都在喝保罗……同样感谢。 +
达利：我在想……如果没有青少年中心，你们这些年轻人会做什么？你会很失落，不是吗？ +
保罗：哈！我想没关系。但我告诉你……​我们不需要血腥的青年俱乐部来找事做。我……嗯……我只在有舞会的时候才来。他们对不断发生的事情感到厌烦……好吧……他们需要检查一下自己的头脑。如果我想喝酒……那么那里有酒吧，不是吗。 +
布伦特夫人：但是保罗你多大了？十六？你不能在酒吧喝酒——这是违法的。 +
保罗：还没有酒吧招待把我赶出去。无论如何……谢谢你的饮料。丹妮丝，跳舞怎么样？ +
丹妮丝：我不介意。 +
保罗：那就来吧。 +
芬奇利：呃……你愿意跳舞吗，布伦特夫人？ +
布伦特夫人：谢谢……​但是不行。音乐不是我这一代的。你知道……代沟。当我年轻的时候，我从来不敢像保罗那样说话。尤其是有牧师在场的情况下。 +
詹姆斯：你认为布伦特夫人生活在一个什么样的世界？了解人们……尤其是年轻人……的本来面目是我工作的一部分。 +
布伦特夫人：请不要误解我。我只是觉得这很冒犯。如果我自己的儿子……​ +
詹姆斯：哦，我已经习惯了。从某种意义上说，我觉得这是一种赞美……​ +
  达利：恭维？ +
詹姆斯：别误会我的意思。保罗可以像对待朋友一样自由地向我表达自己的想法。他接受我作为一种朋友。 +
芬奇利：实际上，所谓的代沟是一个神话，你知道。青少年其实并没有那么不同。作为一名老师，我发现他们的态度非常传统。 +
达利：但是看看他们的穿着方式......还有他们的头发！ +
詹姆斯：我认为你没有明白要点。这些东西都是很表面的。我同意芬奇利先生的观点……​基本上他们的态度与我这一代人非常相似。 +
达利：所以你同意我们刚才从保罗那里听到的那种语言……​ +
詹姆斯：我没有这么说。无论如何，“批准”和“不批准”的概念往往过于简单化问题。每一代人都会创造自己的……自己的特殊语言……就像他们在服装和音乐上创造自己的风格一样。 +
布伦特夫人：只是……呃……当今青少年的风格和习惯是如此……基本上……如此令人无法接受。 +
芬奇利：你的意思是你无法接受。 +
布伦特夫人：不……我的意思是社会其他人无法接受。 +
达利：当你想到这一点时......我的意思是我总是对我儿子的衣服感兴趣...... +
詹姆斯：所以你也觉得他们不可接受。 +
达利：不……让我说完。我正想说其实他的衣服很实用……​很简单。 +
芬奇利：无论如何……代沟是不存在的。我的意思是……青少年的想法……青少年一代……拒绝了父母的价值观，因为混合了暴力和昏昏欲睡……嗯……这是完全不现实的。 +
布伦特夫人：芬奇利先生，我真希望您有一个自己的十几岁的儿子或女儿。 +
芬奇利：但我和他们有更多的接触……​ +
布伦特夫人：我并不是说你不了解他们的问题。 +
芬奇利：作为英语老师，我与他们的联系……很密切。你看，我们定期进行讨论……他们经常在放学后和青少年中心进行讨论。你会发现它们很有趣。如果你愿意的话，可以找个时间来坐坐。 +
达利：那会很有趣。 +
布伦特夫人：我会不好意思说什么。 +
芬奇利：我并不是说你有必要参与讨论。听就是了。你会意识到我认为他们的态度是多么传统。 +
  詹姆斯：例如？ +
芬奇利：例如……你可能不会这么认为，但大多数人……对婚姻……和家庭有坚定的信念。 +
达利：这些是我从未和我儿子谈论过的事情。 +
芬奇利：有一点非常明确……非常值得注意的是，他们总是在寻找机会帮助他人……​ +
布伦特夫人：嗯，托尼在家里帮不了什么忙……​ +
芬奇利：……​帮助那些真正需要帮助的人。布伦特夫人，不只是帮忙洗碗。无论如何……讨论中得出的另一点是，几乎所有人（我应该说大约 90%）都与父母相处得很好。 +
布伦特夫人：哦，但是我……​ +
芬奇利：大多数分歧似乎都集中在头发和整体外表上。 +
詹姆斯：我们称这些为肤浅的。 +
  芬奇利：没错。 +
达利：我喜欢参加讨论的想法。我会带你去解决这个问题。 +
芬奇利：好的。还有布伦特夫人。因为你会觉得很尴尬……​ +
布伦特夫人：嗯，我……我并不是真的想说令人尴尬。只是……​你知道……​ +
芬奇利：有一本你应该读的书……​由国家儿童局出版。它被称为英国的十六岁孩子。我把我的副本借给你。 +
布伦特夫人：你真是太好了。听着，我最好走了。从我儿子跳舞的方式来看，他会整晚都在跳舞。 +
达利：布伦特夫人，你有车吗？ +
布伦特夫人：没有。有公共汽车。 +
达利：那么请让我载你一程。 +
布伦特夫人：我不想妨碍你。 +
达利：一点也不。无论如何……我们必须以年轻人为榜样，不是吗？帮助那些有需要的人，我的意思是……好吧……我们会说晚安……​ +
  声音：晚安。 +

1. How was trade conducted, then, without money to pay for goods? The answer is by bartering. Bartering is the process by which trade takes place through the exchange of goods. Money is not used as payment. Instead, one good is traded for another good. +
2. As trade became more common as a result of people's interdependence upon one another, it was necessary to develop or invent a more convenient method of payment. Consequently, a new form of exchange medium, money, was introduced into society. +
3. Of course, the evolution from a total barter society to one that was totally monetized did not occur overnight. In fact, today there are still societies that are not monetized, although they account for an insignificant amount of world trade. In the interim between a barter world and a monetized world, both systems operated together. +
4. As I stated earlier, money has a specific value, but due to certain conditions, the money — or currency, as money is referred to — of some countries is more valuable than that of other countries. +
5. It is difficult to give examples of barter deals because in most cases the terms of the contract are not disclosed. In some cases, we don't hear about barter transactions simply because they work so well. If one company has arranged a profitable exchange, it will be very quiet about it so that its competitors will not come in and try to make a better deal. +
6. It is unlikely that the world will revert to a totally barter-oriented existence, but until the economic disorder that is present in today's world is remedied, bartering will probably become increasingly important as an exchange medium.

那么，在没有钱支付货物的情况下，贸易是如何进行的呢？答案是通过物物交换。易货贸易是通过货物交换进行贸易的过程。金钱不用作付款。相反，一种商品被交换为另一种商品。 +
由于人们相互依赖，贸易变得更加普遍，因此有必要开发或发明一种更方便的支付方式。因此，一种新形式的交换媒介——货币——被引入社会。 +
当然，从完全的易货社会到完全货币化的社会的演变并不是一夜之间发生的。事实上，今天仍然有一些社会没有货币化，尽管它们在世界贸易中所占的份额微不足道。在易货世界和货币化世界之间的过渡时期，两个系统一起运行。 +
正如我前面所说，货币具有特定的价值，但由于某些条件，某些国家的货币（或货币）比其他国家的货币更有价值。 +
很难给出易货交易的例子，因为在大多数情况下，合同条款都没有披露。在某些情况下，我们没有听说过易货交易，只是因为它们运作良好。如果一家公司安排了一项有利可图的交易，它会对此非常安静，这样它的竞争对手就不会介入并试图达成更好的交易。 +
世界不太可能恢复到完全以物易物为导向的存在，但在当今世界存在的经济混乱得到纠正之前，物物交换作为交换媒介可能会变得越来越重要。
