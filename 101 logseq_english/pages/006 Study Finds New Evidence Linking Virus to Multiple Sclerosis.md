	- Researchers have found more evidence that one of the world’s most common viruses may be linked to the disease multiple sclerosis.
	- MS causes the body’s own immune system to mistakenly attack nerve cells. It destroys the protective material that covers nerve tissue.
	- The Epstein-Barr virus has long been suspected of playing a part in development of MS. But a connection is hard to prove because just about everybody gets infected with Epstein-Barr but few develop MS.
	- Last week, Harvard researchers reported one of the largest studies yet to support the possible link between the virus and MS. They studied a supply of blood samples from usual medical tests on more than 10 million members of the American military. The samples cover a period from 1993 to 2013. The scientists searched the samples for antibodies signaling viral infection.
	- They found that the risk of MS increased by 32 times following Epstein-Barr infection.
	- Only 5.3 percent of the sampled group were free of signs of the virus when they joined the military. The researchers compared 801 MS cases found later over the 20-year period with 1,566 service members who never got MS.
	- Only one of the MS patients had no evidence of the Epstein-Barr virus before their MS diagnosis. And the researchers found no evidence that other viral infections were involved.
	- The findings “strongly suggest” that Epstein-Barr infection is “a cause and not a consequence of MS,” study leader Alberto Ascherio and his team reported in the publication Science. Dr. Ascherio is with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
	- The virus appears to be “the initial trigger,” Dr. William H. Robinson and Dr. Lawrence Steinman of Stanford University wrote in a report alongside the study.
	- Epstein-Barr is best known for causing “mono,” or infectious mononucleosis, in teenagers and young adults. The virus remains inactive in the body after infection and has been linked to later development of some autoimmune diseases, including MS, and rare cancers.
	- It is not clear why. Some scientists think the body is tricked by viral proteins that look very much like nerve proteins.
	- Whatever the cause may be, the new study is “the strongest evidence to date that Epstein-Barr contributes to cause MS,” said Mark Allegretta. He is vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
	- He added that the evidence, “opens the door to potentially prevent MS by preventing Epstein-Barr infection.”
	- I’m Caty Weaver.

		  传染性单核白血球增多症（英语：Infectious mononucleosis，缩写“IM”，别名mono、glandular fever、Pfeiffer's disease、Filatov's disease）是一种由EB病毒(是疱疹病毒家族成员之一)造成的传染病。大部分人是在孩童时期被感染，当时症状轻微或没有症状。罹患 infectious mononucleosis , 在青壮年族群会造成发烧、喉咙痛、颈部淋巴结肿大以及疲倦感。大部分人会在两到四周后痊愈，然而疲倦感会持续数月。肝脏或脾脏也会肿大，在1%案例中会造成脾脏破裂。
