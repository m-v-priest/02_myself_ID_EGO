title:: 031 What Is the US Capitol Building?

- pure
  collapsed:: true
	- In 1863, the American poet Walt Whitman wrote approvingly about the United States Capitol building in Washington, DC.
	- Whitman described the building as calm and confident. And he said the Capitol’s dome made it easily recognized and seen throughout the Washington area.
	- Whitman called the dome “a vast eggshell, built of iron and glass.” He also likened it to a bubble, a tiara, and a “towering bulge of pure white.”
	- Today, the Capitol building is still a well-known symbol of the U.S. government. Although some people confuse it with the White House, where the president lives, it is the home of the U.S. Congress. In other words, the Capitol is the place where the country’s lawmakers meet to discuss, make and approve legislation. The House of Representatives meets in the building’s south wing. The Senate meets in its north wing.
	- The two large meeting rooms for lawmakers are called chambers. Usually House members and senators meet in their own chambers. But from time to time, they gather together in the House chamber, which is larger.
	- These gatherings are called joint sessions of Congress. They happen at least once a year when the president gives a speech that is called the State of the Union address. Sometimes joint sessions of Congress happen after an election or when a foreign leader speaks.
	- U.S. lawmakers also gather at the Capitol when a president is sworn-in. Years ago, those swearing-in ceremonies – called inaugurations – sometimes took place inside the building. But today they usually are held outside. Many people who have never visited Washington, DC may still recognize the Capitol building because they have seen pictures of it during a presidential inauguration.
	- And those who come to Washington can visit the Capitol building in person. The U.S. Capitol Visitors Center can hold up to 4,000 people at one time. Visitors can see the building up close, learn its history and even listen to lawmakers debate the issues of the day.

		- > ▶  from time to time 不时,有时,时常,偶尔
		- 通常众议院成员和参议员在各自的议院开会。但有时，他们会聚集在众议院的大厅里，那里更大。
	- These gatherings /are called **joint sessions of Congress.** They happen /at least once a year /when the president gives a speech /that is called **the State of the Union address**. Sometimes **joint sessions of Congress** /happen after an election /or when a foreign leader speaks.

		  这里的state，指的是：状态、情况（注意不要理解为“国家”，或“陈述”）。而the Union，当U大写时，指的是：the United States（美国）。所以，State of the Union的字面意思是：美国国情.
		  除了**State of the Union**，国情咨文还有几个接近的说法，**State of the Union speech**，或 **state of the Union address**.
		  每年的SOTU大会，总有一名政府内阁成员是缺席的。原因是万一美国总统或其他继任者在做国情咨文报告时发生不测，这位缺席的成员可以继任总统，以确保美国政府的连续运作。在IT术语里，这类措施叫灾备（DR，Disaster Recovery）。
