	- 进一步 我们考虑了另一些案例, 在这种情况下, 人们无法确信"结果主义道德伦理"正确与否.
- When people hesitated /to push the fat man over the bridge /or to yank out the organs of the innocent patient, people gestured(v.) toward reasons /**having to do with** the intrinsic quality of the act itself, consequences be what they may. People were reluctant.

- People thought it was just wrong, categorically wrong,
- to kill a person, an innocent person,
- even for the sake of saving five lives.
- At least people thought that in the second version
- of each story we considered.
- So this points to a second categorical way of thinking about moral reasoning.
- Categorical moral reasoning locates morality
- in certain absolute moral requirements,
- certain categorical duties and rights, regardless of the consequences.
- We're going to explore in the days and weeks to come
- the contrast between consequentialist and categorical
- moral principles.
- The most influential example of consequential moral reasoning
- is utilitarianism, a doctrine invented
- by Jeremy Bentham, the 18th century
- English political philosopher.
- The most important philosopher of categorical moral reasoning
- is the 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant.
- So we will look at those two different modes
- of moral reasoning, assess them,
- and also consider others.
- If you look at the syllabus, you'll notice that we read
- a number of great and famous books,
- books by Aristotle, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, John Stewart Mill,
- and others.
- You'll notice too from the syllabus
- that we don't only read these books
- we also take up contemporary political, and legal controversies
- that raise philosophical questions. We will debate equality and inequality,
- affirmative action, free speech versus hate speech, same sex marriage,
- military conscription, a range of practical questions. Why?
- Not just to enliven these abstract and distant books
- but to make clear, to bring out what's at stake
- in our everyday lives, including our political lives,
- for philosophy.
- And so we will read these books and we will debate these issues,
- and we'll see how each informs and illuminates the other.
- This may sound appealing enough, but here I have to issue a warning.
- And the warning is this, to read these books
- in this way as an exercise in self knowledge,
- to read them in this way carries certain risks,
- risks that are both personal and political,
- risks that every student of political philosophy has known.
- These risks spring from the fact that philosophy teaches us
- and unsettles us by confronting us with
- what we already know.
- There's an irony. The difficulty of this course consists in the fact
- that it teaches what you already know.
- It works by taking what we know from familiar unquestioned settings
- and making it strange.
- That's how those examples worked, the hypotheticals with which we began,
- with their mix of playfulness and sobriety.
- It's also how these philosophical books work.
- Philosophy estranges us from the familiar,
- not by supplying new information but by inviting and provoking
- a new way of seeing but, and here's the risk,
- once the familiar turns strange, it's never quite the same again.
- Self knowledge is like lost innocence, however unsettling you find it
- it can never be un-thought or un-known.
- What makes this enterprise difficult but also riveting
- is that moral and political philosophy is a story and you don't know
- where the story will lead.
- But what you do know is that the story is about you.
- Those are the personal risks. Now what of the political risks?
- One way of introducing a course like this would be to promise you
- that by reading these books and debating these issues,
- you will become a better, more responsible citizen
- you will examine the presuppositions of public policy,
- you will hone your political judgment,
- you will become a more effective participant in public affairs.
- But this would be a partial and misleading promise.
- Political philosophy, for the most part,
- hasn't worked that way.
- You have to allow for the possibility that political philosophy
- may make you a worse citizen rather than a better one
- or at least a worse citizen before it makes you a better one,
- and that's because philosophy is a distancing,
- even debilitating activity.
- And you see this going back to Socrates, there's a dialogue,
- the Gorgias, in which one of Socrates' friends, Callicles,
- tries to talk him out of philosophizing.
- Callicles tells Socrates "Philosophy is a pretty toy
- if one indulges in it with moderation
- at the right time of life. But if one pursues it further than one should,
- it is absolute ruin."
- "Take my advice," Callicles says, "abandon argument.
- Learn the accomplishments of active life,
- take for your models not those people who spend
- their time on these petty quibbles but those who have a good livelihood
- and reputation and many other blessings."
- So Callicles is really saying to Socrates "Quit philosophizing, get real,
- go to business school."
- And Callicles did have a point. He had a point because philosophy
- distances us from conventions, from established assumptions,
- and from settled beliefs.
- Those are the risks, personal and political.
- And in the face of these risks,
- there is a characteristic evasion.
- The name of the evasion is skepticism, it's the idea...
- well, it goes something like this... we didn't resolve once and for all
- either the cases or the principles we were arguing when we began
- and if Aristotle and Locke and Kant and Mill
- haven't solved these questions after all of these years,
- who are we to think, that we here in Sanders Theatre,
- over the course of a semester, can resolve them?
- And so, maybe it's just a matter of each person having his or her own
- principles and there's nothing more to be said about it,
- no way of reasoning.
- That's the evasion, the evasion of skepticism,
- to which I would offer the following reply.
- It's true, these questions have been debated for a very long time
- but the very fact that they have recurred and persisted
- may suggest that though they're impossible in one sense,
- they're unavoidable in another.
- And the reason they're unavoidable, the reason they're inescapable
- is that we live some answer to these questions every day.
- So skepticism, just throwing up your hands and giving up on moral reflection
- is no solution.
- Immanuel Kant described very well the problem with skepticism
- when he wrote "Skepticism is a resting place
- for human reason, where it can reflect upon
- its dogmatic wanderings, but it is no dwelling place
- for permanent settlement."
- "Simply to acquiesce in skepticism," Kant wrote,
- "can never suffice to overcome the restlessness of reason."
- I've tried to suggest through these stories
- and these arguments some sense of the risks
- and temptations, of the perils and the possibilities.
- I would simply conclude by saying that the aim of this course
- is to awaken the restlessness of reason and to see where it might lead.
- Thank you very much.
- Like, in a situation that desperate, you have to do what you have to do to survive.
- You have to do what you have to do?
- Yeah. You got to do what you got to do, pretty much.
- If you've been going 19 days without any food, you know,
- someone just has to take the sacrifice.
- Someone has to make the sacrifice and people can survive.
- Alright, that's good. What's your name?
- - Marcus.  - Marcus, what do you say to Marcus?
- Last time, we started out last time
- with some stories, with some moral dilemmas
- about trolley cars and about doctors
- and healthy patients vulnerable to being victims
- of organ transplantation.
- We noticed two things about the arguments we had,
- one had to do with the way we were arguing.
- We began with our judgments in particular cases.
- We tried to articulate the reasons or the principles lying behind
- our judgments.
- And then confronted with a new case,
- we found ourselves reexamining those principles,
- revising each in the light of the other.
- And we noticed the built in pressure
- to try to bring into alignment our judgments
- about particular cases and the principles
- we would endorse on reflection.
- We also noticed something about the substance
- of the arguments that emerged from the discussion.
- We noticed that sometimes we were tempted to locate
- the morality of an act in the consequences, in the results,
- in the state of the world that it brought about.
- And we called this consequentialist moral reasoning.
- But we also noticed that in some cases,
- we weren't swayed only by the result.
- Sometimes, many of us felt, that not just consequences
- but also the intrinsic quality or character
- of the act matters morally.
- Some people argued that there are certain things
- that are just categorically wrong even if they bring about
- a good result, even if they saved five people
- at the cost of one life.
- So we contrasted consequentialist moral principles with categorical ones.
- Today and in the next few days, we will begin to examine
- one of the most influential versions of consequentialist moral theory.
- And that's the philosophy of utilitarianism.
- Jeremy Bentham, the 18th century
- English political philosopher gave first the first clear
- systematic expression to the utilitarian moral theory.
- And Bentham's idea, his essential idea,
- is a very simple one.
- With a lot of morally intuitive appeal,
- Bentham's idea is the following,
- the right thing to do, the just thing to do
- is to maximize utility.
- What did he mean by utility?
- He meant by utility the balance of pleasure over pain,
- happiness over suffering.
- Here's how he arrived at the principle of maximizing utility.
- He started out by observing that all of us,
- all human beings are governed by two sovereign masters,
- pain and pleasure.
- We human beings like pleasure and dislike pain.
- And so we should base morality, whether we're thinking about
- what to do in our own lives or whether as legislators or citizens,
- we're thinking about what the laws should be.
- The right thing to do individually or collectively is to maximize,
- act in a way that maximizes the overall level of happiness.
- Bentham's utilitarianism is sometimes summed up
- with the slogan
- "The greatest good for the greatest number."
- With this basic principle of utility on hand,
- let's begin to test it and to examine it
- by turning to another case, another story, but this time,
- not a hypothetical story, a real life story,
- the case of the Queen versus Dudley and Stevens.
- This was a 19th century British law case
- that's famous and much debated in law schools.
- Here's what happened in the case. I'll summarize the story
- then I want to hear how you would rule,
- imagining that you were the jury.
- A newspaper account of the time described the background.
- A sadder story of disaster at sea was never told
- than that of the survivors of the yacht, Mignonette.
- The ship floundered in the South Atlantic,
- 1300 miles from the Cape.
- There were four in the crew, Dudley was the captain,
- Stevens was the first mate, Brooks was a sailor,
- all men of excellent character or so the newspaper account tells us.
- The fourth crew member was the cabin boy,
- Richard Parker, 17 years old.
- He was an orphan, he had no family,
- and he was on his first long voyage at sea.
- He went, the news account tells us,
- rather against the advice of his friends.
- He went in the hopefulness of youthful ambition,
- thinking the journey would make a man of him.
- Sadly, it was not to be. The facts of the case
- were not in dispute.
- A wave hit the ship and the Mignonette went down.
- The four crew members escaped to a lifeboat.
- The only food they had were two cans of
- preserved turnips, no fresh water.
- For the first three days, they ate nothing.
- On the fourth day, they opened one
- of the cans of turnips and ate it.
- The next day they caught a turtle.
- Together with the other can of turnips,
- the turtle enabled them to subsist for the next few days.
- And then for eight days, they had nothing.
- No food. No water.
- Imagine yourself in a situation like that,
- what would you do? Here's what they did.
- By now the cabin boy, Parker, is lying at the bottom
- of the lifeboat in the corner
- because he had drunk seawater against the advice of the others
- and he had become ill and he appeared to be dying.
- So on the 19th day, Dudley, the captain,
- suggested that they should all have a lottery,
- that they should draw lots to see who would die
- to save the rest.
- Brooks refused. He didn't like the lottery idea.
- We don't know whether this was
- because he didn't want to take the chance
- or because he believed in categorical moral principles.
- But in any case, no lots were drawn.
- The next day there was still no ship in sight
- so Dudley told Brooks to avert his gaze
- and he motioned to Stevens that the boy, Parker,
- had better be killed.
- Dudley offered a prayer, he told the boy his time had come,
- and he killed him with a pen knife,
- stabbing him in the jugular vein.
- Brooks emerged from his conscientious objection
- to share in the gruesome bounty.
- For four days, the three of them fed
- on the body and blood of the cabin boy.
- True story. And then they were rescued.
- Dudley describes their rescue in his diary with staggering euphemism.
- "On the 24th day, as we were having our breakfast,
- a ship appeared at last."
- The three survivors were picked up by a German ship.
- They were taken back to Falmouth in England
- where they were arrested and tried.
- Brooks turned state's witness. Dudley and Stevens went to trial.
- They didn't dispute the facts. They claimed they had
- acted out of necessity, that was their defense.
- They argued in effect better that one should die
- so that three could survive. The prosecutor wasn't swayed
- by that argument.
- He said murder is murder, and so the case went to trial.
- Now imagine you are the jury. And just to simplify the discussion,
- put aside the question of law, let's assume that you as the jury
- are charged with deciding whether what they did
- was morally permissible or not.
- How many would vote 'not guilty',
- that what they did was morally permissible?
- And how many would vote 'guilty',
- what they did was morally wrong?
- A pretty sizeable majority.
- Now let's see what people's reasons are and let me begin with those
- who are in the minority.
- Let's hear first from the defense of Dudley and Stevens.
- Why would you morally exonerate them?
- What are your reasons? Yes.
- I think it's... I think it is morally reprehensible
- but I think that there is a distinction
- between what's morally reprehensible and what makes someone
- legally accountable.
- In other words, as the judge said,
- what's always moral isn't necessarily against the law
- and while I don't think that necessity justifies theft
- or murder or any illegal act, at some point your degree
- of necessity does, in fact, exonerate you from any guilt.
- Okay. Good. Other defenders. Other voices for the defense.
- Moral justifications for what they did. Yes.
- Thank you. I just feel like
- in the situation that desperate, you have to do
- what you have to do to survive.
- You have to do what you have to do.
- Yeah, you've got to do what you've got to do.
- Pretty much. If you've been going
- 19 days without any food, you know, someone just has to take the sacrifice,
- someone has to make the sacrifice and people can survive.
- And furthermore from that, let's say they survive
- and then they become productive members of society
- who go home and start like a million charity organizations
- and this and that and this and that.
- - I mean they benefited everybody in the end.  - Yeah.
- So, I mean I don't know what they did afterwards,
- they might have gone and like, I don't know,
- - killed more people, I don't know. Whatever but.  - What?
- Maybe they were assassins.
- What if they went home and they turned out to be assassins?
- What if they'd gone home and turned out to be assassins? Well...
- You'd want to know who they assassinated.
- That's true too. That's fair. That's fair. I would want to know
- who they assassinated.
- All right. That's good. What's your name?
- - Marcus.  - Marcus. All right.
- We've heard a defense, a couple of voices
- for the defense.
- Now we need to hear from the prosecution.
- Most people think what they did was wrong. Why?
- - Yes.  - One of the first things that I was thinking was
- they haven't been eating for a really long time
- maybe they... they're... they're mentally like affected and so
- then that could be used as a defense,
- a possible argument that they weren't
- in the proper state of mind, they weren't making decisions
- they might otherwise be making.
- And if that's an appealing argument that... that you have to be
- in an altered mindset to do something like that,
- it suggests that people who find that argument convincing
- do think that they were acting immorally.
- But what do you... I want to know
- what you think. You defend them.
- - No, no, no.  - I'm sorry, you vote to convict, right?
- Yeah, I don't think that they acted in a morally
- appropriate way.
- And why not? What do you say,
- here's Marcus, he just defended them.
- He said... you heard what he said.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- That you've got to do what you've got to do
- - in a case like that. What do you say to Marcus?  - Yeah.
- That there's no situation that would allow
- human beings to take the idea of fate or
- the other people's lives in their own hands,
- that we don't have that kind of power.
- Good. Okay. Thank you.
- And what's your name?
- Britt.
- - Britt. Okay. Who else? What do you say? Stand up.  - Yes.
- I'm wondering if Dudley and Stevens had asked Richard Parker's... for Richard Parker's
- consent in you know, dying, if that would exonerate them
- from... from an act of murder and if so,
- is that still morally justifiable?
- That's interesting. All right. Consent.
- Wait wait, hang on. What's your name?
- Kathleen.
- Kathleen says suppose they had that,
- what would that scenario look like?
- So in the story Dudley is there, pen knife in hand,
- but instead of the prayer or before the prayer,
- he says "Parker, would you mind?"
- "We're desperately hungry",
- as Marcus empathizes with, "we're... we're desperately hungry.
- - You're not going to last long anyhow."  -Yeah. You can be a martyr.
- "Would you be a martyr? How about it Parker?"
- Then, then, what do... what do you think? Would it be morally justified then?
- - I don't think...  - Suppose... suppose Parker in his semi-stupor says "Okay."
- I don't think it would be morally justifiable but I'm wondering if...
- - Even then, even then it wouldn't be?  - No.
- You don't think that even with consent
- it would be morally justified?
- Are there people who think, uh, who want to take up
- Kathleen's consent idea and who think that
- that would make it morally justified?
- Raise your hand if it would, if you think it would.
- That's very interesting. Why would consent
- make a moral difference? Why would it? Yes.
- Well, I just think that if he was making
- his own original idea and it was his idea
- to start with, then that would be
- the only situation in which I would see it
- being appropriate in any way because that way
- you couldn't make the argument that he was pressured,
- you know it's three-to-one or whatever the ratio was.
- - Right.  - And I think that if he was making a decision
- to give his life and he took on the agency
- to sacrifice himself which some people
- might see as admirable and other people might disagree
- with that decision.
- So if he came up with the idea,
- that's the only kind of consent we could have
- confidence in morally then it would be okay.
- Otherwise, it would be kind of coerced consent
- under the circumstances, you think.
- Is there anyone who thinks that even the consent of Parker
- would not justify their killing him? Who thinks that? Yes.
- Tell us why. Stand up.
- I think that Parker would be killed with the hope
- that the other crew members would be rescued so there's no
- definite reason that he should be killed
- because you don't know when they're going to get rescued
- so if you kill him, it's killing him in vain,
- do you keep killing a crew member until you're rescued
- and then you're left with no one because someone's going
- to die eventually?
- Well, the moral logic of the situation seems to be that,
- that they would keep on picking off the weakest maybe,
- one by one, until they were rescued.
- And in this case, luckily, they were rescued when three at least
- were still alive. Now, if Parker did give his consent,
- would it be all right, do you think or not?
- - No, it still wouldn't be right.  - And tell us why
- it wouldn't be all right.
- First of all, cannibalism, I believe, is morally incorrect
- so you shouldn't be eating human anyway.
- So cannibalism is morally objectionable as such so then,
- even on the scenario of waiting until someone died,
- still it would be objectionable.
- Yes, to me personally, I feel like it all depends
- on one's personal morals and like we can't sit here and just,
- like this is just my opinion, of course other people
- are going to disagree, but...
- Well we'll see, let's see what their disagreements are
- and then we'll see if they have reasons that can
- persuade you or not.
- Let's try that. All right.
- Now, is there someone who can explain,
- those of you who are tempted by consent,
- can you explain why consent makes such
- a moral difference?
- What about the lottery idea? Does that count as consent?
- Remember at the beginning, Dudley proposed a lottery,
- suppose that they had agreed to a lottery,
- then how many would then say it was all right?
- Suppose there were a lottery, cabin boy lost,
- and the rest of the story unfolded, then how many people would say
- it was morally permissible?
- So the numbers are rising if we had a lottery.
- Let's hear from one of you for whom the lottery
- would make a moral difference. Why would it?
- I think the essential element, in my mind,
- that makes it a crime is the idea that they decided
- at some point that their lives were more important than his,
- and that, I mean, that's kind of the basis for really any crime.
- Right? It's like my needs, my desires are more important
- than yours and mine take precedent.
- And if they had done a lottery where everyone consented
- that someone should die and it's sort of like they're all
- sacrificing themselves to save the rest.
- Then it would be all right?
- - A little grotesque but...  - But morally permissible?
- - Yes.  - And what's your name?
- - Matt.  - So Matt, for you,
- what bothers you is not the cannibalism
- but the lack of due process.
- I guess you could say that.
- Right? And can someone who agrees with Matt say a little bit more
- about why a lottery would make it, in your view, morally permissible.
- Go ahead.
- The way I understood it originally was that
- that was the whole issue is that the cabin boy
- was never consulted about whether or not
- something was going to happen to him,
- even with the original lottery whether or not
- he would be a part of that, it was just decided
- that he was the one that was going to die.
- Right, that's what happened in the actual case.
- Right.
- But if there were a lottery and they'd all agreed to the procedure,
- you think that would be okay?
- Right, because then everyone knows that there's going to be a death,
- whereas the cabin boy didn't know that this discussion was even happening,
- there was no forewarning for him to know that
- "Hey, I may be the one that's dying."
- All right. Now, suppose everyone agrees
- to the lottery, they have the lottery, the cabin boy loses,
- and he changes his mind.
- You've already decided, it's like a verbal contract.
- You can't go back on that, you've decided,
- the decision was made.
- If you know that you're dying for the reason of others to live.
- If someone else had died, you know that you would
- consume them so...
- Right. But then you could say, "I know, but I lost".
- I just think that that's the whole moral issue
- is that there was no consulting of the cabin boy
- and that's what makes it the most horrible
- is that he had no idea what was even going on.
- That had he known what was going on,
- it would be a bit more understandable.
- All right. Good. Now I want to hear...
- so there are some who think it's morally permissible
- but only about 20%, led by Marcus.
- Then there are some who say the real problem here
- is the lack of consent, whether the lack of consent
- to a lottery, to a fair procedure or, Kathleen's idea,
- lack of consent at the moment of death.
- And if we add consent, then more people are willing
- to consider the sacrifice morally justified.
- I want to hear now, finally, from those of you
- who think even with consent, even with a lottery,
- even with a final murmur of consent by Parker,
- at the very last moment, it would still be wrong.
- And why would it be wrong? That's what I want to hear. Yes.
- Well, the whole time I've been leaning off towards
- the categorical moral reasoning and I think that there's a possibility
- I'd be okay with the idea of a lottery
- and then the loser taking into their own hands to kill themselves
- so there wouldn't be an act of murder,
- but I still think that even that way, it's coerced.
- Also, I don't think that there is any remorse,
- like in Dudley's diary, "We're eating our breakfast,'
- it seems as though he's just sort of like, you know,
- the whole idea of not valuing someone else's life.
- So that makes me feel like I have to take the...
- You want to throw the book at him when he lacks remorse
- or a sense of having done anything wrong.
- Right.
- So, all right. Good. Are there any other defenders
- who say it's just categorically wrong, with or without consent?
- Yes. Stand up. Why?
- I think undoubtedly the way our society is shaped
- murder is murder.
- Murder is murder in every way
- and our society looks at murder down on the same light
- and I don't think it's any different in any case.
- Good. Let me ask you a question. There were three lives at stake versus one.
- Okay.
- The one, the cabin boy, he had no family,
- he had no dependents, these other three had families
- back home in England, they had dependents,
- they had wives and children. Think back to Bentham.
- Bentham says we have to consider
- the welfare, the utility, the happiness of everybody.
- We have to add it all up so it's not just numbers,
- three against one, it's also all of those
- people at home.
- In fact, the London newspaper at that time and popular opinion
- sympathized with them, Dudley and Stevens,
- and the paper said if they weren't motivated
- by affection and concern for their loved ones at home
- and their dependents, surely they wouldn't have done this.
- Yeah and how is that any different
- from people on a corner trying, with the same desire
- to feed their family. I don't think it's any different.
- I think in any case, if I'm murdering you
- to advance my status, that's murder,
- and I think that we should look at all that
- in the same light instead of criminalizing
- certain activities and making certain things
- seem more violently savage when in the same case,
- it's all the same, it's all the same act and mentality that goes
- into murder, necessity to feed your family so...
- Suppose it weren't three, suppose it were 30? 300?
- One life to save 300? Or in wartime? 3000?
- Suppose the stakes are even bigger.
- Suppose the stakes are even bigger?
- I think it's still the same deal.
- You think Bentham is wrong to say the right thing to do
- is to add up the collective happiness?
- You think he's wrong about that?
- I don't think he's wrong but I think murder is murder
- in any case.
- Well, then Bentham has to be wrong.
- If you're right, he's wrong.
- Okay, then he's wrong. I'm right.
- All right. Thank you. Well done. All right.
- Let's step back from this discussion and notice how many objections
- have we heard to what they did?
- We heard some defenses of what they did.
- The defenses had to do with necessity, their dire circumstance and,
- implicitly at least, the idea that numbers matter.
- And not only numbers matter but the wider effects matter,
- their families back home, their dependents.
- Parker was an orphan, no one would miss him.
- So if you add up, if you try to calculate the balance
- of happiness and suffering, you might have a case
- for saying what they did was the right thing.
- Then we heard at least three different types of objections.
- We heard an objection that said what they did
- was categorically wrong, like here at the end,
- categorically wrong, murder is murder,
- it's always wrong even if it increases the overall
- happiness of society, a categorical objection.
- But we still need to investigate why murder is categorically wrong.
- Is it because even cabin boys have certain fundamental rights?
- And if that's the reason, where do those rights come from
- if not from some idea of the larger welfare
- or utility or happiness?
- Question number one. Others said a lottery
- would make a difference, a fair procedure Matt said,
- and some people were swayed by that.
- That's not a categorical objection exactly.
- It's saying everybody has to be counted as an equal
- even though at the end of the day, one can be sacrificed
- for the general welfare.
- That leaves us with another question to investigate.
- Why does agreement to a certain procedure,
- even a fair procedure, justify whatever result flows
- from the operation of that procedure?
- Question number two. And question number three,
- the basic idea of consent. Kathleen got us on to this.
- If the cabin boy had agreed himself, and not under duress, as was added,
- then it would be all right to take his life to save the rest
- and even more people signed on to that idea.
- But that raises a third philosophical question:
- What is the moral work that consent does?
- Why does an act of consent make such a moral difference,
- that an act that would be wrong,
- taking a life without consent, is morally permissible with consent?
- To investigate those three questions, we're going to have to read
- some philosophers.
- And starting next time, we're going to read Bentham
- and John Stuart Mill, utilitarian philosophers.
