	- Studies of both animals and humans /have shown that **sex hormones** somehow(ad.)  affect(v.) **the stress response**, causing females **under stress** /to produce more of **the rigger chemicals** /than do males /under the same conditions.

	- **Adding to** a woman’s increased dose of **stress chemicals**, are her **increased “opportunities”** for stress. “**It’s not necessarily(ad.) that** /women don’t **cope as well**. It’s just that /they have so much more **to cope with**,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for **tolerating stress** /may even be greater than men’s,” she observes, “it’s just that /they’re dealing with **so** many more things /**that** they become **worn out from it** /more visibly(ad.) and sooner.”

The kinds of **interpersonal violence** /that women are exposed to /tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be **one-shot deals**. The wear-and-tear /that comes from these longer relationships /can be quite devastating.”

	- Not everyone experiences(v.) the kinds of severe **chronic stresses** /Alvarez describes. But most women today **are coping with** a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez’s experience demonstrates(v.)  the importance of finding ways **to diffuse(v.) stress** /before it threatens your health and your ability to function.

			- > ▶  obligation =the state of being forced to do sth because it is your duty, or because of a law, etc 义务；职责；责任
