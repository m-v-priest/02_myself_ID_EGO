title:: 005 Experts: More Variants after Omicron Likely

- PURE TEXT
  collapsed:: true
	- Scientists warn that the fast-spreading Omicron will likely not be the last worrisome version of the coronavirus.
	- The Omicron version of the coronavirus was first identified in mid-November. By the first week of January, the World Health Organization reported a record 15 million new COVID-19 cases. That is a 55 percent increase from the previous week.
	- Every new infection provides a chance for the virus to mutate, or change. The fast spread of Omicron means the virus has more chances to develop new versions, called variants.
	- Scientists do not know what the next variants will look like or how they might shape the pandemic. But they say there is no guarantee that new coronavirus variants will cause milder illness or that existing vaccines will work against them. And they urge wider vaccination now, while the shots still work against the virus.
	- Dr. Leonardo Martinez is an infectious disease expert at Boston University. He said, “The faster Omicron spreads, the more opportunities there are for mutation, potentially leading to more variants.”
	-
	- ## More contagious, breakthrough infections
	- Research shows that Omicron is at least two times as contagious as the Delta variant and four times more contagious than the original version of the virus. Contagious means the variant could easily pass between people.
	  Omicron is also more likely than Delta to reinfect individuals who previously had COVID-19 and to cause “breakthrough infections” - meaning to cause an infection even if a person is vaccinated.
	  The variant’s quick spread increases the chances that the virus will infect and remain inside people with weakened immune systems - giving it more time to develop mutations or changes.
	- Dr. Stuart Campbell Ray of Johns Hopkins University said, “It’s the longer...infections that seem to be the most likely breeding grounds for new variants.” He added more infections also increased the chances for that to happen.
	-
	- ## Other possibilities for the virus
	- Since Omicron appears to cause less severe disease than Delta, there is hope that it could make the virus milder like a common cold. It is a possibility, experts say, given that viruses do not spread well if they kill their hosts very quickly. But viruses do not always get less deadly over time.
	- Ray explained that a variant could realize its main goal – replicating or reproducing – if it caused mild infections at first then caused severe illness later. This would give time for an infected person to spread the virus to others before getting very sick.
	- Ray added, “I don’t think we can be confident that the virus will become less lethal over time.” Lethal is a term that means deadly.
	- When SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused COVID-19, first appeared, no one was immune. But infections and vaccines have given at least some immunity to much of the world, so the virus must change to survive and spread to others.
	- There are many possible ways for such change to take place.
	- Animals could possibly release new variants. Dogs and cats, deer and farm-raised mink are some of the animals that could be infected by the virus. The virus could mutate within them and then jump back to people.
	- Another possibility is that people could get infected with both Omicron and Delta at the same time. Such infections could create what Ray calls “Frankenvariants” with qualities of both variants.
	- When new variants do develop, scientists said it is still very difficult to know which ones might spread. For example, Omicron has 30 mutations that let it attach easily to human cells. But the IHU variant, identified in France, has 46 mutations and does not seem to have spread much at all.
	- To control or limit the spread of new variants, scientists stress continuing with public health measures such as wearing face coverings and getting vaccinated.
	- Louis Mansky is director of the Institute for Molecular Virology at the University of Minnesota. He said with so many unvaccinated people, “the virus is still kind of in control of what’s going on.”

It is a possibility, experts say, **given that** viruses do not spread well /if they kill their hosts(n.) very quickly. But viruses do not always get less deadly /over time.

		  /**~ of sb/sth** : a large number of people or things 许多；大量
		  -> **a host of possibilities** 多种可能性
		- 由于Omicron 病毒引起的疾病, 似乎没有Delta病毒那么严重，因此有希望使这种病毒变得像普通感冒一样温和。专家说，这是一种可能，因为如果病毒迅速杀死了宿主，它就不能很好地传播。但病毒并不总是随着时间的推移而变得不那么致命。
	- Ray explained(v.) that /a variant **could realize(v.) its main goal** – replicating or reproducing – if it caused **mild infections** at first /then caused **severe illness** later. This would give time for **an infected person** /==to spread== the virus ==to== others /before getting very sick.

		- > ▶ realize (v.)( not used in the progressive tenses 不用于进行时 ) to understand or become aware of a particular fact or situation 理解；领会；认识到；意识到
		  /to achieve sth important that you very much want to do 实现；将…变为现实
		  /[ VN ] [ usually passive ] if sb's fears are realized , the things that they are afraid will happen do happen （所担心的事）发生，产生
		  -> We try to help all students **realize(v.) their full potential** (= be as successful as they are able to be) . 我们努力帮助所有的学生充分发挥他们的潜力。
		- > ▶ replicate (v.) ( technical 术语 ) ~ (itself) ( of a virus or a molecule 病毒或分子 ) to produce exact copies of itself 再造；再生；自我复制 /[ VN ] ( formal ) to copy sth exactly 复制；（精确地）仿制
		- > ▶ reproduce (v.)[ VN ] to make a copy of a picture, piece of text, etc. 复制 /if people, plants, animals, etc. reproduce or reproduce themselves , they produce young 繁殖；生育
		  -> cells reproducing themselves (= making new ones) 自我繁殖的细胞
		- Ray解释说，如果一种变种病毒, 采取这种策略:  即最初只引起轻微的感染，之后再引起严重的疾病，它就可以实现它的主要目标——复制或繁殖自己。病毒的这种策略, 能让感染者在他们病情严重之前, 有时间将病毒传播给其他人。
	- Ray added, “**I don’t think we can be confident that** /the virus will become less lethal(a.) over time.” Lethal is a term that means deadly.
		- > ▶ lethal : /ˈliːθl/(a.)causing or able to cause death 致命的；可致死的 /危害极大的；破坏性极大的
		  => 来自拉丁语letum,死亡，词源不详。可能同Lethe,冥河，地狱，引申词义死去的，致命的。
		- > ▶ term  词语；术语；措辞 /期；期限；任期
	- When SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused COVID-19, first appeared, no one was immune(a.). But infections and vaccines **have given** at least some immunity **to** much of the world, so the virus must change /to survive(v.) and spread to others.
		- > ▶ immune  /ɪˈmjuːn/ (a.) ~ (to sth) that cannot catch or be affected by a particular disease or illness 有免疫力 /不受影响 /~ (from sth) protected from sth and therefore able to avoid it 受保护；免除；豁免
		- 当导致COVID-19 的SARS-CoV-2病毒首次出现时，没有人有免疫力。但是感染和疫苗至少给了世界上大部分地区的人一些免疫力，所以病毒必须变异, 才能存活下去, 并继续传播给其他人。
	- There are many possible ways /for such change **to take place**.
	- Animals could possibly release new variants. `主` Dogs and cats, deer and **farm-raised(a.) mink** `系` are some of the animals /that could be infected by the virus. The virus could mutate within them /and then jump back to people.
		- > ▶ farm-raised 人工饲养的
		- > ▶ mink : [ C ] a small wild animal with thick shiny fur, a long body and short legs. Mink are often kept on farms for their fur. 水貂
		  -> a mink jacket 貂皮外套

	- Another possibility is that /people could **get infected with** both Omicron and Delta at the same time. Such infections could create what Ray calls “Frankenvariants” with qualities of both variants.

But the IHU variant, identified in France, has 46 mutations /and does not seem to have spread much at all.
		- 当新的变种确实出现时，仍然很难知道哪些变种可能会传播。例如，Omicron有30个突变，可以很容易地附着在人类细胞上。但是，在法国发现的IHU变异有46个突变，却似乎传播得不多。
	- To control or limit(v.) the spread of new variants, scientists stress(v.) continuing with **public health measures** such as **wearing(v.) face coverings** and **getting vaccinated**.
		- 为了控制或限制新病毒变种的传播，科学家强调, 应继续采取公共卫生措施，如戴口罩和接种疫苗。
	- Louis Mansky is director of the Institute for **Molecular Virology** at the University of Minnesota. He said /with so many unvaccinated people, “the virus is still **kind of** in control of **what’s going on**.”

		- > ▶ molecular   /məˈlekjələr/  adj. 分子的，与分子有关的
		- > ▶ virology  /vaɪˈrɒlədʒi/ [ U ] the scientific study of viruses and the diseases caused by them 病毒学
		- > ▶ kind of ( also ˈkinda ) ( informal ) slightly; in some ways 稍微；有几分；有点儿
		  -> I like him, kind of. 我有点儿喜欢他。
		- 有这么多的人没有接种疫苗，“病毒在某种程度上, 依然控制着事态的发展。”
