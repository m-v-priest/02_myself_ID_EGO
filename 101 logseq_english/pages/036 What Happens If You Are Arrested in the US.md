- # 036 What Happens If You Are Arrested in the US
- pure
  collapsed:: true
	- If you have ever watched an American crime show, you know about this Supreme Court case. Listen to what the police officer says.
	- “You do have the right to remain silent. You also have the right to be represented by an attorney…”
	- Those rights – the rights not to speak and to have a lawyer – are known as Miranda rights.
	- The name comes from Ernesto Miranda. In 1963, he was arrested and charged with kidnapping, robbing, and raping a young woman. Police arrested Miranda and questioned him. Miranda admitted to some of the crimes, and a jury later used his confession to find him guilty.
	- But some activists said Miranda’s trial was not fair. The reason, they said, was because police had not clearly told Miranda about his rights. The U.S. Constitution says people do not have to admit to wrongdoing.
	- A majority of justices agreed. Their decision changed police policies, and strengthened protections for people who have been arrested.
	- By the way, Ernesto Miranda? He was given another trial. This time, lawyers could not use his confession against him. But they did use sworn statements by his ex-girlfriend. He was again found guilty and sentenced to prison.

	- “You do have the right **to remain silent**. You also have the right **to be represented by an attorney**…”
		- > ▶ attorney : a lawyer, especially one who can act for sb in court 律师（尤指代表当事人出庭者） /a person who is given the power to act on behalf of another in business or legal matters （业务或法律事务上的）代理人
		  => 前缀at-同ad-. -torn同turn, 转。转向顾客的，代表当事人利益的人。
		  -> **district attorney** : ( abbr. DA ) (in the US) a lawyer who is responsible for bringing criminal charges against sb in a particular area or state （美国）地方检察官

		  =>  what is the difference between **lawyer** and **attorney**? 
		  ->  in American English, we use the two words interchangeably. Some people with licenses to practice /do not represent clients in court. They work /in other law-related professions. **Attorneys**, however, **are people /that do represent clients in court.**
		  在美式英语中，这两个词可以互换使用。一些有执业执照的人不代表客户出庭。他们从事其他与法律相关的职业。然而，Attorneys 是在法庭上代表客户的人。
	- Those rights – the rights not to speak /and to have a lawyer – are known as **Miranda rights**.
		- >  You have the right to remain silent /and refuse to answer questions.
		  **Anything you say /may be used against you** /in a court of law.
		  You have the right ①to consult(v.) an attorney /before speaking to the police /and ②to have an attorney /present during questioning /now or in the future.
		  If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you /before any questioning if you wish.
		  **If you decide to answer questions now /without an attorney present, you will still have the right /to stop answering at any time /until you talk to an attorney.**
		  Knowing and understanding your rights /as I have explained them to you, **are you willing to answer my questions /without an attorney present?**
		  你有权保持沉默，你对任何一个警察所说的一切都将可能被作为法庭对你不利的证据。
		  如果决定在没有律师在场的情况下回答问题，你仍然有权利在任何时候停止回答，直到你和律师谈话。
		  了解和理解了向你解释的权利后，你愿意在没有律师在场的情况下回答我的问题吗？
