== (解说) 北美殖民地人民, 自治民主议会的建立

Although many differences separated Spain and France from England, perhaps the factor that contributed most to distinct paths of colonization was the form of their government.
尽管西班牙和法国与英国之间存在许多差异，但对不同殖民化道路贡献最大的因素也许是它们的政府形式。

Spain and France had absolute monarchies, but Britain had a limited monarchy. In New France and New Spain, all authority flowed from the Crown to the settlers, with no input from below.
西班牙和法国实行绝对君主制，但英国实行有限君主制。在新法兰西和新西班牙，所有权力都从王室流向定居者，没有来自下层的干预。

An absolute monarchy is a state in which the monarch has sovereign power and controls all aspects of government without being checked by any representative assemblies.
绝对君主制是君主拥有主权并控制政府各个方面而不受任何代表议会制衡的国家。


A limited or constitutional monarchy is a state in which the power of the monarch is checked by other constitutionally sanctioned institutions, such as a REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY (e.g., the British Parliament).
有限君主制或君主立宪制是君主的权力受到其他宪法认可的机构（例如代表大会（例如英国议会））检查的国家。

The English kings who ruled the 13 original colonies reserved the right to decide the fate of their colonies as well, but not alone. The colonists drew upon their claims to traditional English rights and insisted on raising their own representative assemblies. Such was the case with the VIRGINIA HOUSE OF BURGESSES, the first popularly elected legislative body in the New World.
统治最初 13 个殖民地的英国国王也保留决定其殖民地命运的权利，但不是单独决定。殖民者利用他们对英国传统权利的主张，坚持建立自己的代表大会。弗吉尼亚议院就是这种情况，它是新世界第一个民选立法机构。

English landowners had insisted on meeting with their leaders for consultation in local matters ever since the MAGNA CARTA was signed in 1215. Virginia settlers expected that same right.
自 1215 年《大宪章》签署以来，英国土地所有者就一直坚持与他们的领导人会面，协商当地事务。弗吉尼亚定居者也希望拥有同样的权利。

Modeled after the English Parliament, the General Assembly was established in 1619. In 1643 it became a bicameral body, establishing the House of Burgesses as one of its two chambers. Members would meet at least once a year with their royal governor to decide local laws and determine local taxation.
仿效英国议会，大会于 1619 年成立。1643 年，它成为两院制机构，并设立了下议院作为其两院之一。成员每年至少与皇家总督会面一次，以决定当地法律并确定地方税收。


The FOUNDERS of the New England colonies had an entirely different mission from the Jamestown settlers. Although economic prosperity was still a goal of the New England settlers, their true goal was spiritual. Fed up with the ceremonial Church of England, Pilgrims and Puritans sought to recreate society in the manner they believed God truly intended it to be designed.
新英格兰殖民地的创始人肩负着与詹姆斯敦定居者完全不同的使命。尽管经济繁荣仍然是新英格兰定居者的目标，但他们真正的目标是精神上的。厌倦了英国教会的仪式，朝圣者和清教徒试图以他们相信上帝真正想要设计的方式重建社会。

Where else but in the New World could such a golden opportunity be found? The land was unspoiled. Children could be raised without the corruption of old English religious ideas. The chance to create a perfect society was there for the taking. The Stuart kings saw America a means to get rid of troublemakers. Everything was falling into place.
除了新世界之外，还能在哪里找到这样的黄金机会呢？这片土地没有受到任何破坏。孩子们可以在不受古老英国宗教观念污染的情况下成长。创建一个完美社会的机会就在眼前。斯图亚特国王将美国视为摆脱麻烦制造者的手段。一切都步入正轨。

By 1620, the seeds for a new society, quite different from the one already established at Jamestown, were planted deeply within the souls of a few brave pioneers. Their quest would form the basis of New England society.
到 1620 年，一个与詹姆斯敦已经建立的社会截然不同的新社会的种子已深深植根于一些勇敢的先驱者的灵魂中。他们的追求将构成新英格兰社会的基础。


Not all the English Separatists set out for the New World.
并非所有英国分离主义者都出发前往新世界。

The first group to leave England actually headed for the Dutch Netherlands in 1608. They became uneasy in their new land as their children started speaking Dutch and abandoning English traditions. Even worse to the Separatists, the tolerance shown to them by the Dutch was shown to many different faiths. They became disgusted with the attention paid to worldly goods, and the presence of many "unholy" faiths.
第一批离开英国的人实际上是在 1608 年前往荷属荷兰。当他们的孩子开始说荷兰语并放弃英国传统时，他们对这片新土地感到不安。对分离主义者来说更糟糕的是，荷兰人对他们表现出的宽容也体现在对许多不同信仰的宽容。他们对对世俗物品的关注以及许多“不神圣”信仰的存在感到厌恶。


The great Separatist experiment in the Netherlands came to a quick end, as they began to look elsewhere for a purer place to build their society. Some headed for English islands in the Caribbean. Those who would be forever known to future Americans as the Pilgrims set their sights on the New World in late 1620.
荷兰伟大的分离主义实验很快就结束了，因为他们开始在其他地方寻找更纯粹的地方来建设他们的社会。有些前往加勒比海的英国​​岛屿。那些被未来的美国人永远称为“清教徒”的人于 1620 年底将目光投向了新大陆。

Over a hundred travelers embarked on the voyage of the Mayflower in September 1620. Less than one third were Separatists. The rest were immigrants, adventurers, and speculators.
1620 年 9 月，一百多名旅客踏上了五月花号的航行。其中不到三分之一是分离主义者。其余的是移民、冒险家和投机者。


One of the greatest twists of fate in human history occurred on that epochal voyage. The Pilgrims were originally bound for Virginia to live north of Jamestown under the same charter granted to citizens of Jamestown. Fate charted a different course. Lost at sea, they happened upon a piece of land that would become known as Cape Cod. After surveying the land, they set up camp not too far from PLYMOUTH ROCK.  +
人类历史上最伟大的命运转折之一发生在这次划时代的航行中。根据授予詹姆斯敦公民的同一宪章，清教徒最初前往弗吉尼亚州居住在詹姆斯敦以北。命运开辟了一条不同的道路。他们在海上迷路了，偶然发现了一块后来被称为科德角的土地。勘察完土地后，他们在距离普利茅斯岩不远的地方扎营。



The Pilgrims had an important question to answer before they set ashore. Since they were not landing within the jurisdiction of the Virginia Company, they had no CHARTER to govern them. Who would rule their society?
清教徒们在上岸之前有一个重要的问题需要回答。由于他们不在弗吉尼亚公司的管辖范围内着陆，因此没有宪章来管理他们。谁来统治他们的社会？

In the landmark MAYFLOWER COMPACT OF 1620, the Pilgrims decided that they would rule themselves, based on majority rule of the townsmen. This independent attitude set up a tradition of self-rule that would later lead to TOWN MEETINGS and elected legislatures in New England.
在 1620 年具有里程碑意义的《五月花契约》中，朝圣者决定在城镇居民多数统治的基础上进行自我管理。这种独立的态度建立了自治的传统，后来导致了新英格兰的城镇会议和选举产生的立法机构。

Like the Virginia House of Burgesses established the previous year, Plymouth colony began to lay the foundation for democracy in the American colonies.
就像前一年成立的弗吉尼亚众议院一样，普利茅斯殖民地开始为美洲殖民地的民主奠定基础。



The passengers of the Arbella who left England in 1630 with their new charter had a great vision. They were to be an example for the rest of the world in rightful living. Future governor JOHN WINTHROP stated their purpose quite clearly: "We shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us."
1630 年，阿尔贝拉号上的乘客带着新包机离开英国，他们怀揣着伟大的愿景。他们将成为世界其他地区正确生活的榜样。未来的州长约翰·温思罗普 (JOHN WINTHROP) 非常明确地阐明了他们的目的：“我们将成为山上之城，所有人的目光都集中在我们身上。”

The Arbella was one of eleven ships carrying over a thousand Puritans to Massachusetts that year. It was the largest original venture ever attempted in the English New World. The passengers were determined to be a beacon for the rest of Europe, "A Modell of Christian Charity," in the words of the governor.
阿贝拉号是当年载着一千多名清教徒前往马萨诸塞州的 11 艘船之一。这是英国新世界有史以来最大的原创冒险活动。乘客们决心成为欧洲其他地区的灯塔，用州长的话来说，是“基督教慈善的典范”。


Puritans believed in PREDESTINATION. This doctrine holds that God is all-powerful and all-knowing; therefore, the fate of each individual soul is known to God at birth. Nothing an individual can do or say could change their ultimate fate. Puritans believed that those chosen by God to be saved — the elect — would experience "CONVERSION." In this process, God would reveal to the individual His grace, and the person would know he was saved.
清教徒相信预定论。该学说认为，上帝是全能、全知的。因此，每个灵魂的命运在出生时就为上帝所知。一个人所做或所说的任何事情都无法改变他们最终的命运。清教徒相信那些被上帝选中要得救的人——选民——会经历“转变”。在这个过程中，神会向个人显明他的恩典，这个人就会知道他已经得救了。


Only the elect could serve as Church members. If a person were truly saved, he would only be capable of behavior endorsed by God. These "living saints" would serve as an example to the rest of the world. During the early years, ministers such as JOHN COTTON carefully screened individuals claiming to have experienced conversion.
只有选民才能成为教会成员。一个人如果真正得救了，他只能做出神所认可的行为。这些“活着的圣人”将为世界其他地区树立榜样。早年，约翰·科顿（JOHN COTTON）等牧师仔细筛选了声称经历过转变的个人。


An elected legislature was established, echoing the desire for self-government already seen in other English colonies. Although ministers were prohibited from holding political office, many of the most important decisions were made by the clergy. In 1636, HARVARD COLLEGE was instituted for the purpose of training Puritan ministers.
选举产生的立法机构成立，呼应了其他英国殖民地已经出现的自治愿望。尽管部长被禁止担任政治职务，但许多最重要的决定都是由神职人员做出的。 1636年，哈佛学院成立，旨在培养清教徒牧师。

By the end of the 1630s, as part of a "GREAT MIGRATION" of Puritans out of England, nearly 14,000 more Puritan settlers came to Massachusetts, and the colony began to spread. In 1691, Plymouth colony, still without a charter, was absorbed by their burgeoning neighbor to the West.
到 1630 年代末，作为清教徒离开英格兰的“大迁徙”的一部分，近 14,000 名清教徒定居者来到马萨诸塞州，殖民地开始扩张。 1691 年，尚未获得特许状的普利茅斯殖民地被其新兴的西方邻国吞并。

The great experiment seemed to be a smashing success for the first few decades. In the end however, worldly concerns led to a decline in religious fervor as the 1600s grew old.
这项伟大的实验在最初的几十年里似乎取得了巨大的成功。然而最终，随着 1600 年代的衰老，世俗的担忧导致宗教热情下降。


The Puritans believed they were doing God's work. Hence, there was little room for compromise. Harsh punishment was inflicted on those who were seen as straying from God's work. There were cases when individuals of differing faiths were hanged in BOSTON COMMON.
清教徒相信他们正在做上帝的工作。因此，妥协的余地很小。那些被视为偏离上帝工作的人受到严厉的惩罚。曾有不同信仰的人在 BOSTON COMMON 被绞死的案例。


ROGER WILLIAMS was a similar threat.
罗杰威廉姆斯也有类似的威胁。


Two ideas got him into big trouble in Massachusetts Bay. First, he preached separation of church and state. He believed in complete RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, so no single church should be supported by tax dollars. Massachusetts Puritans believed they had the one true faith; therefore such talk was intolerable. Second, Williams claimed taking land from the Native Americans without proper payment was unfair.
有两个想法让他在马萨诸塞湾陷入了大麻烦。首先，他宣扬政教分离。他相信完全的宗教自由，因此任何一个教会都不应该靠税收来支持。马萨诸塞州的清教徒相信他们拥有唯一的真正信仰。因此这种言论是无法容忍的。其次，威廉姆斯声称在没有适当付款的情况下从美洲原住民手中夺取土地是不公平的。


Massachusetts wasted no time in banishing the minister.
马萨诸塞州立即驱逐了这位部长。

In 1636, he purchased land from the NARRAGANSETT Indians and founded the colony of RHODE ISLAND. Here there would be complete religious freedom. Dissenters from the English New World came here seeking refuge. Anne Hutchinson herself moved to Rhode Island before her fatal relocation to New York.
1636 年，他从纳拉甘西特印第安人手中购买了土地，并建立了罗德岛殖民地。在这里会有完全的宗教自由。来自英国新大陆的持不同政见者来到这里寻求庇护。安妮·哈钦森 (Anne Hutchinson) 本人在搬到纽约之前搬到了罗德岛。

America has long been a land where people have reserved the right to say, "I disagree." Many early settlers left England in the first place because they disagreed with English practice. Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were two brave souls who reminded everyone at their own great peril of that most sacred right.
美国长期以来一直是一个人们保留说“我不同意”的权利的国家。许多早期定居者首先离开英格兰是因为他们不同意英国的做法。罗杰·威廉姆斯和安妮·哈钦森是两个勇敢的灵魂，他们提醒每个人在自己面临巨大危险时记住这项最神圣的权利。


Unlike solidly Puritan New England, the middle colonies presented an assortment of religions. The presence of Quakers, MENNONITES, LUTHERANS, DUTCH CALVINISTS, and PRESBYTERIANS made the dominance of one faith next to impossible.
与纯粹的清教徒新英格兰不同，中部殖民地呈现出各种各样的宗教。贵格会、门诺派、路德派、荷兰加尔文派和长老会的出现使得单一信仰的统治几乎不可能。

Advantaged by their central location, the middle colonies served as important distribution centers in the English mercantile system. New York and Philadelphia grew at a fantastic rate. These cities gave rise to brilliant thinkers such as Benjamin Franklin, who earned respect on both sides of the Atlantic. In many ways, the middle colonies served as the crossroads of ideas during the colonial period.
中部殖民地凭借其中心位置的优势，成为英国商业体系中重要的配送中心。纽约和费城以惊人的速度增长。这些城市孕育了本杰明·富兰克林等杰出思想家，他们赢得了大西洋两岸的尊重。在许多方面，中部殖民地都是殖民时期思想的十字路口。

The Dutch had no patience for democratic institutions. The point of the colony was to enrich its stockholders.
荷兰人对民主制度没有耐心。殖民地的目的是使其股东致富。

Slavery was common during the Dutch era, as the DUTCH WEST INDIA COMPANY was one of the most prominent in the world's trade of slaves.
奴隶制在荷兰时代很常见，因为荷兰西印度公司是世界奴隶贸易中最著名的公司之一。

When a powerful English military unit appeared in New Amsterdam, Governor Stuyvesant was forced to surrender and New Netherland became New York.
当一支强大的英国军队出现在新阿姆斯特丹时，史岱文森总督(荷兰人)被迫投降，新荷兰成为纽约。

Virginia was the first successful southern colony.
弗吉尼亚是第一个成功的南方殖民地。
