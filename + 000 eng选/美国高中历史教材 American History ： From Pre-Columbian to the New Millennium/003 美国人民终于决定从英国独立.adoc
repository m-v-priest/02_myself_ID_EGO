The distance British colonists enjoyed from their kings made direct rule nearly impossible. The Virginia House of Burgesses was the first representative assembly in the Western Hemisphere. The Pilgrims committed themselves to self rule in the form of the Mayflower Compact before they had ever set foot on the new continent. Town meetings were quickly the norm throughout New England. The Quaker faith made equality a practice in the community and the meetinghouse throughout the Middle Colonies. All these important steps toward independence were already realized by the American colonists before 1700. Events in the early part of the eighteenth century made independence from Britain even more inevitable.
英国殖民者与国王的距离使得直接统治几乎不可能。弗吉尼亚众议院是西半球第一个代表大会。清教徒们在踏上新大陆之前就以《五月花号公约》的形式承诺实行自治。城镇会议很快就成为整个新英格兰的常态。贵格会信仰使平等成为整个中部殖民地社区和教堂的一种实践。所有这些迈向独立的重要步骤在1700年之前就已经被美国殖民者实现了。18世纪初期的事件使得脱离英国的独立变得更加不可避免。

Many events transpired between the years of 1763 and 1776 that served as short-term causes of the Revolution. But the roots had already been firmly planted. In many ways, the American Revolution had been completed before any of the actual fighting began.
 1763 年至 1776 年间发生的许多事件都是革命的短期原因。但根已经扎得很牢了。从很多方面来说，美国革命在任何实际战斗开始之前就已经完成了。


New ideas shaped political attitudes as well. John Locke defended the displacement of a monarch who would not protect the lives, liberties, and property of the English people. JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU stated that society should be ruled by the "general will" of the people. BARON DE MONTESQUIEU declared that power should not be concentrated in the hands of any one individual. He recommended separating power among executive, legislative, judicial branches of government. American intellectuals began to absorb these ideas. The delegates who declared independence from Britain used many of these arguments. The entire opening of the Declaration of Independence is Thomas Jefferson's application of John Locke's ideas. The constitutions of our first states and the UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION reflect Enlightenment principles. The writings of Benjamin Franklin made many Enlightenment ideas accessible to the general public.
新思想也塑造了政治态度。约翰·洛克为一位不愿保护英国人民的生命、自由和财产的君主的流亡辩护。让-雅克·卢梭指出，社会应该由人民的“公意”来统治。孟德斯鸠男爵宣称权力不应集中在任何个人手中。他建议将政府行政、立法、司法部门的权力分开。美国知识分子开始吸收这些思想。宣布脱离英国独立的代表们使用了许多这样的论点。 《独立宣言》的整个开头就是托马斯·杰斐逊对约翰·洛克思想的应用。我们最早的州的宪法和美国宪法反映了启蒙运动的原则。本杰明·富兰克林的著作使许多启蒙思想为公众所接受。


The old way of life was represented by superstition, an angry God, and absolute submission to authority. The thinkers of the Age of Reason ushered in a new way of thinking. This new way championed the accomplishments of humankind. Individuals did not have to accept despair. Science and reason could bring happiness and progress. Kings did not rule by divine right. They had an obligation to their subjects. Europeans pondered the implications for nearly a century. Americans put them into practice first.
旧的生活方式以迷信、愤怒的上帝和绝对服从权威为代表。理性时代的思想家开创了一种新的思维方式。这种新方式捍卫了人类的成就。个人不必接受绝望。科学和理性可以带来幸福和进步。国王并不以神权来统治。他们对自己的臣民负有义务。欧洲人思考了近一个世纪的影响。美国人首先将其付诸实践。


No democracy has existed in the modern world without the existence of a FREE PRESS. Newspapers and pamphlets allow for the exchange of ideas and for the voicing of dissent. When a corrupt government holds power, the press becomes a critical weapon. It organizes opposition and can help revolutionary ideas spread. The trial of JOHN PETER ZENGER, a New York printer, was an important step toward this most precious freedom for American colonists.
如果没有新闻自由，现代世界就不存在民主。报纸和小册子允许交流思想和表达异议。当腐败的政府掌权时，媒体就成为关键武器。它组织反对派，可以帮助革命思想传播。对纽约印刷商约翰·彼得·曾格 (JOHN PETER ZENGER) 的审判是美国殖民者走向这一最宝贵自由的重要一步。


The British had an empire to run. The prevailing economic philosophy of seventeenth and eighteenth century empires was called MERCANTILISM. In this system, the colonies existed to enrich the mother country. Restrictions were placed on what the colonies could manufacture, whose ships they could use, and most importantly, with whom they could trade. British merchants wanted American colonists to buy British goods, not French, Spanish, or Dutch products. In theory, Americans would pay DUTIES on imported goods to discourage this practice. The NAVIGATION ACTS and the MOLASSES ACT are examples of royal attempts to restrict colonial trade. SMUGGLING is the way the colonists ignored these restrictions.
英国人要经营一个帝国。十七、十八世纪帝国盛行的经济哲学被称为重商主义。在这个体系中，殖民地的存在是为了丰富母国。殖民地可以制造什么，可以使用谁的船只，最重要的是，可以与谁进行贸易都受到限制。英国商人希望美国殖民者购买英国商品，而不是法国、西班牙或荷兰的产品。理论上，美国人会对进口商品缴纳关税以阻止这种做法。 《航海法》和《糖蜜法》是王室试图限制殖民地贸易的例子。走私是殖民者无视这些限制的方式。


Distance and the size of the British Empire worked to colonial advantage. Prior to 1763, the British followed a policy known as SALUTARY NEGLECT. They passed laws regulating colonial trade, but they knew they could not easily enforce them. It cost four times as much to use the British navy to collect duties as the value of the duties themselves. Colonists, particularly in New England, thought nothing of ignoring these laws. Ships from the colonies often loaded their holds with illegal goods from the French, Dutch, and Spanish West Indies. British customs officials earned a modest salary from the Crown. They soon found their pockets stuffed with bribe money from colonial shippers. When smugglers were caught, they were often freed by sympathetic American juries. Smuggling became commonplace. The British estimated that over £700,000 per year were brought into the American colonies illegally.
距离和大英帝国的规模对殖民有利。在1763年之前，英国人遵循一种被称为“有益忽视”的政策。他们通过了规范殖民地贸易的法律，但他们知道执行起来并不容易。使用英国海军征收关税的成本是关税本身价值的四倍。殖民者，尤其是新英格兰的殖民者，对这些法律不屑一顾。来自殖民地的船只经常装载来自法国、荷兰和西班牙西印度群岛的非法货物。英国海关官员从王室那里领取微薄的薪水。他们很快就发现自己的口袋里塞满了殖民地托运人的贿款。当走私者被抓住时，他们通常会被同情的美国陪审团释放。走私变得司空见惯。据英国估计，每年有超过70万英镑被非法带入美国殖民地。


approached, the tradition of smuggling became vital to the Revolutionary cause. This encouraged ignoring British law, particularly in the harbors of New England. American shippers soon became quite skilled at avoiding the British navy, a practice they used extensively in the Revolutionary War. Soon England began to try offenders in admiralty courts, which had no juries. All attempts to crack down merely brought further rebellion.
随着 1776 年的临近，走私传统对于革命事业变得至关重要。这鼓励了人们无视英国法律，特别是在新英格兰的港口。美国托运人很快就变得非常擅长避开英国海军，这是他们在独立战争中广泛使用的做法。很快，英国开始在没有陪审团的海事法庭审判罪犯。所有镇压的尝试都只会带来进一步的叛乱。

American colonists had proven themselves experienced rebels. Whenever they felt their rights were jeopardized, they seemed willing to take up arms. Economic exploitation, lack of political representation, unfair taxation, were among the causes that led to these clashes.
美国殖民者已经证明自己是经验丰富的叛逆者。每当他们感到自己的权利受到威胁时，他们似乎都愿意拿起武器。经济剥削、缺乏政治代表性、不公平的税收是导致这些冲突的原因之一。

The emerging American would be ready to fight for justice and if necessary independence.
新兴的美国人将准备好为正义而战，并在必要时争取独立。

At the time of the American Revolution, English citizens made up less than two thirds of the colonial population, excluding Native Americans. Nearly one fifth of the population was of African descent. Of the white population, there was still tremendous diversity, particularly in Pennsylvania, America's first MELTING POT. Most numerous of the non-English settler population were the Germans and the Scots-Irish.
美国独立战争时期，不包括美洲原住民，英国公民仅占殖民地人口的不到三分之二。近五分之一的人口是非洲人后裔。在白人人口中，仍然存在巨大的多样性，特别是在美国第一个大熔炉宾夕法尼亚州。大多数非英国定居者是德国人和苏格兰爱尔兰人。


Soon these cultures began to blend. Americans became culturally distinct from the English. Their language, culture, and religions differed greatly from those of MOTHER ENGLAND. Most Americans were born here and never even visited England during their lives. The Germans were never loyal to England. The Scots-Irish had great resentment toward Great Britain. The ties that bound them to the British Crown were weakening fast.
很快这些文化开始融合。美国人在文化上与英国人截然不同。他们的语言、文化和宗教与英国母亲有很大不同。大多数美国人出生在这里，一生中甚至从未访问过英国。德国人从来不忠于英国。苏格兰爱尔兰人对英国怀有极大的怨恨。他们与英国王室的联系正在迅速减弱。

During the century that preceded American independence, England and France would fight four major wars, with the rest of Europe often actively participating as well. Each time there was conflict, war reached the shores of North America. With each conflict, France would slowly lose influence. King William's War and Queen Anne's War led to the removal of French power from ACADIA, now NOVA SCOTIA. After losses were incurred during KING GEORGE'S WAR, the French maintained their North American holdings only by ceding land to Britain elsewhere. The final blow, the French and Indian War, would remove France from the continental mainland altogether. How could momentum shift so rapidly? Much of the answer lies in the histories of France and England. But profound differences between New France and the English American colonies contributed to the outcome.
在美国独立之前的一个世纪里，英国和法国爆发了四次重大战争，欧洲其他国家也经常积极参与。每次发生冲突时，战争都会波及北美海岸。每次冲突，法国都会慢慢失去影响力。威廉国王战争和安妮女王战争导致法国权力从阿卡迪亚（现为新斯科舍省）消失。在乔治王战争期间遭受损失后，法国人只能通过在其他地方割让土地给英国来维持其在北美的领土。最后一击，即法印战争，将法国彻底从大陆上赶走。势头如何转变得如此之快？大部分答案在于法国和英国的历史。但新法兰西和英属美洲殖民地之间的深刻差异促成了这一结果。

The imperial struggle took its toll on England. First, the empire incurred tremendous debt. Its attempts to recoup losses by charging the American colonists would ultimately be one of the causes of revolution. Also, the leadership experience gained by colonial fighters such as George Washington during the wars for empire would be used against the Redcoats in the decades that followed. Moreover, France did not forget the embarrassment of defeat. What better way to strike back at Britain than to provide direct aid to the colonists fighting for freedom?
帝国斗争给英国带来了损失。首先，帝国背负巨额债务。它试图通过向美国殖民者发起进攻来挽回损失，这最终将成为革命的原因之一。此外，乔治·华盛顿等殖民战士在帝国战争中获得的领导经验将在接下来的几十年里用来对抗英国红衣党。而且，法国并没有忘记失败的尴尬。还有什么比向争取自由的殖民者提供直接援助更好的反击英国的方式呢？

About the same time John Smith and the Jamestown settlers were setting up camp in Virginia, France was building permanent settlements of their own.
大约在约翰·史密斯和詹姆斯敦定居者在弗吉尼亚州扎营的同时，法国也在建设自己的永久定居点。

There were profound differences between New England and NEW FRANCE. The English colonies, though much smaller in area, dwarfed the French colonization in population. Louis XIV was a devout Catholic and tolerated no other faiths within the French Empire. French HUGUENOTS, the dominant religious minority, therefore found no haven in New France. Land was less of an issue in France than England, so French peasants had less economic incentive to leave. The French Crown was far more interested in its holdings in the Far East and the sugar islands of the Caribbean, so the French monarchs did little to sponsor emigration to North America. Eventually, the sparse French population would be no match for the more numerous British colonists as the wars raged on.
新英格兰和新法国之间存在着深刻的差异。英国殖民地虽然面积小得多，但人口却使法国殖民地相形见绌。路易十四是一位虔诚的天主教徒，不容忍法兰西帝国境内的其他信仰。因此，占主导地位的宗教少数派法国胡格诺派在新法兰西找不到避难所。与英国相比，土地在法国不是一个大问题，因此法国农民离开的经济动力较小。法国王室对其在远东和加勒比海糖岛的财产更感兴趣，因此法国君主几乎没有资助移民到北美。最终，随着战争的激烈进行，稀少的法国人口将无法与数量较多的英国殖民者相抗衡。

Unlike the English colonies where self-rule had been pursued immediately, the people of New France had no such privileges. There were no elected assemblies. Decisions were made by local MAGISTRATES on behalf of the French king. Trial by jury did not exist, nor did a free press. The French citizenry depended directly on the Crown for guidance. The English colonists depended on themselves. In the end, despite huge claims to North American lands, the French would be overwhelmed by more numerous, self-directed subjects of Britain.
与立即实行自治的英国殖民地不同，新法兰西人民没有这样的特权。没有民选议会。决定由当地地方法官代表法国国王做出。陪审团审判不存在，新闻自由也不存在。法国公民直接依赖国王的指导。英国殖民者只能依靠自己。最终，尽管法国对北美土地提出了巨大的要求，但法国仍将被数量更多、自主的英国臣民所压倒。

Few figures loom as large in American history as GEORGE WASHINGTON. His powerful leadership, unflagging determination, and boundless patriotism would be essential to the winning of the Revolutionary War, the creation of the United States Constitution, and the establishment of a new government as the nation's first president. As time has passed, his legend has grown. Honesty — he could not tell a lie, we are told. Strength — he could throw a coin across the Potomac, the legend declares. Humility — he was offered an American crown, but turned it down in the name of democracy. Time may have made great myths out of small truths, but the contributions this one man made to the creation of the American nation cannot be denied.
在美国历史上，很少有人物能像乔治·华盛顿那样举足轻重。他强有力的领导、坚定不移的决心和无限的爱国主义对于赢得独立战争、制定美国宪法以及作为国家第一任总统建立新政府至关重要。随着时间的推移，他的传奇故事不断流传。诚实——据我们所知，他不会说谎。力量——传说中他可以将一枚硬币扔过波托马克河。谦逊——有人向他提供一顶美国王冠，但他以民主的名义拒绝了。时间也许会从小事实中创造出伟大的神话，但这个人对美国国家的创建所做出的贡献是不可否认的。


Round four of the global struggle between England and France began in 1754. Unlike the three previous conflicts, this war began in America.
英法之间的第四轮全球斗争始于1754年。与前三场冲突不同，这场战争始于美国。

The terms of the Treaty of Paris were harsh to losing France. All French territory on the mainland of North America was lost. The British received Quebec and the Ohio Valley. The port of New Orleans and the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi were ceded to Spain for their efforts as a British ally.
《巴黎条约》的条款对于失去法国来说是严酷的。法国在北美大陆的所有领土都丧失了。英国人接收了魁北克和俄亥俄河谷。由于西班牙作为英国盟友的努力，新奥尔良港和密西西比河以西的路易斯安那领土被割让给西班牙。


There is nothing like fear to make a group of people feel close to a protector. The American colonists had long felt the threat of France peering over their shoulders. They needed the might of the great British military to keep them safe from France. With France gone, this was no longer true. They could be free to chart their own destinies.
没有什么比恐惧更能让一群人感觉自己与保护者很亲近了。美国殖民者长期以来一直感受到法国在他们身后窥视的威胁。他们需要强大的英国军队的力量来保护他们免受法国的侵害。随着法国的消失，这不再是事实。他们可以自由地规划自己的命运。

In 1763, few would have predicted that by 1776 a revolution would be unfolding in British America.
1763 年，很少有人预料到 1776 年英属美洲将爆发一场革命。

The ingredients of discontent seemed lacking — at least on the surface. The colonies were not in a state of economic crisis; on the contrary, they were relatively prosperous. Unlike the Irish, no groups of American citizens were clamoring for freedom from England based on national identity. KING GEORGE III was not particularly despotic — surely not to the degree his predecessors of the previous century had been. Furthermore, the colonies were not unified.
至少在表面上，似乎缺乏不满的成分。殖民地并没有处于经济危机状态；相反，他们相对繁荣。与爱尔兰人不同，没有任何美国公民团体基于民族认同而大声疾呼脱离英国的自由。乔治三世国王并不是特别专制——肯定没有达到他上个世纪的前任们的专制程度。此外，殖民地并不统一。


How, then, in a few short years did everything change? What happened to make the American colonists, most of whom thought of themselves as English subjects, want to break the ties that bound them to their forebears? What forces led the men and women in the 13 different colonies to set aside their differences and unanimously declare their independence?
那么，短短几年，一切是如何发生变化的呢？发生了什么让大多数自认为是英国臣民的美国殖民者想要打破将他们与祖先联系在一起的纽带？是什么力量让13个不同殖民地的男男女女抛开分歧，一致宣布独立？

Much happened between the years of 1763 and 1776. The colonists felt unfairly taxed, watched over like children, and ignored in their attempts to address grievances. Religious issues rose to the surface, political ideals crystallized, and, as always, economics were the essence of many debates.
1763 年至 1776 年间发生了很多事情。殖民者感到自己的税收不公平，他们像孩子一样受到监视，在他们试图解决不满的过程中却被忽视。宗教问题浮出水面，政治理想具体化，而经济一如​​既往地成为许多辩论的本质。

For their part, the British found the colonists unwilling to pay their fair share for the administration of the Empire. After all, citizens residing in England paid more in taxes than was asked of any American during the entire time of crisis.
就英国而言，他们发现殖民者不愿意为帝国的管理支付应有的份额。毕竟，在整个危机期间，居住在英国的公民缴纳的税款比任何美国人所要求的还要多。

This was not the first time American colonists found themselves in dispute with Great Britain. But this time the cooler heads did not prevail. Every action by one side brought an equally strong response from the other. The events during these important years created sharp divisions among the English people, among the colonists themselves, and between the English and the Colonists.
这并不是美国殖民者第一次发现自己与英国发生争端。但这一次，冷静的头脑并没有占上风。一方的每一个举动都会引起另一方同样强烈的反应。这些重要年份发生的事件在英国人民、殖民者本身以及英国人和殖民者之间造成了尖锐的分歧。



Worst of all, the British now began levying taxes against American colonists. What had gone wrong?
最糟糕的是，英国现在开始向美国殖民者征税。出了什么问题？



The British point of view is not difficult to grasp. The Seven Years' War had been terribly costly. The TAXES asked of the American colonists were lower than those asked of mainland English citizens. The revenue raised from taxing the colonies was used to pay for their own defense. Moreover, the funds received from American colonists barely covered one-third of the cost of maintaining British troops in the 13 colonies.
英国人的观点并不难理解。七年战争的代价极其惨重。美国殖民者所要求的税收低于英国大陆公民所要求的税收。对殖民地征税所获得的收入被用来支付他们自己的国防费用。此外，从美国殖民者那里获得的资金仅够维持13个殖民地的英国军队费用的三分之一。

The Americans, however, saw things through a different lens. What was the purpose of maintaining British GARRISONS in the colonies now that the French threat was gone? Americans wondered about contributing to the maintenance of troops they felt were there only to watch them.
然而，美国人却从不同的角度看待事情。既然法国的威胁已经消失，英国在殖民地保留驻军的目的是什么？美国人想知道是否可以为维持部队做出贡献，因为他们觉得那只是为了观看他们的部队。

True, those in England paid more in taxes, but Americans paid much more in sweat. All the land that was cleared, the Indians who were fought, and the relatives who died building a colony that enhanced the British Empire made further taxation seem insulting.
确实，英国人缴纳的税款更多，但美国人付出的汗水要多得多。所有被清理的土地、被征战的印第安人，以及为建立大英帝国而牺牲的亲戚，进一步的征税似乎是一种侮辱。

In addition to emotional appeals, the colonists began to make a political argument, as well. The tradition of receiving permission for levying taxes dated back hundreds of years in British history. But the colonists had no representation in the British Parliament. To tax them without offering representation was to deny their traditional rights as English subjects. This could not stand.
除了情感诉求外，殖民者也开始提出政治争论。获得征税许可的传统可以追溯到英国数百年前的历史。但殖民者在英国议会中没有代表权。在不提供代表的情况下向他们征税就等于否认他们作为英国臣民的传统权利。这是无法忍受的。

The Stamp Act of 1765 was not the first attempt to tax the American colonies. Parliament had passed the SUGAR ACT and Currency Act the previous year. Because tax was collected at ports though, it was easily circumvented. Indirect taxes such as these were also much less visible to the consumer.
1765 年的《印花税法》并不是对美洲殖民地征税的第一次尝试。议会去年通过了《糖法》和《货币法》。由于税收是在港口征收的，因此很容易规避。诸如此类的间接税对消费者来说也不太明显。

When Parliament passed the STAMP ACT in March 1765, things changed. It was the first direct tax on the American colonies. Every legal document had to be written on specially stamped paper, showing proof of payment. Deeds, wills, marriage licenses — contracts of any sort — were not recognized as legal in a court of law unless they were prepared on this paper. In addition, newspaper, dice, and playing cards also had to bear proof of tax payment. American activists sprang into action.
当议会于 1765 年 3 月通过《印花税法》时，情况发生了变化。这是对美洲殖民地的第一个直接税。每份法律文件都必须写在专门盖章的纸上，以显示付款证明。契约、遗嘱、结婚证——任何类型的合同——除非在这张纸上准备好，否则在法庭上不会被认为是合法的。此外，报纸、骰子、扑克牌也必须附有纳税证明。美国活动人士立即采取行动。


Taxation in this manner and the QUARTERING ACT (which required the American colonies to provide food and shelter for British troops) were soundly thrashed in colonial assemblies. From Patrick Henry in Virginia to James Otis in Massachusetts, Americans voiced their protest. A Stamp Act Congress was convened in the colonies to decide what to do.
以这种方式征税和《驻营法》（要求美洲殖民地为英国军队提供食物和住所）在殖民地议会中遭到了严厉的抨击。从弗吉尼亚州的帕特里克·亨利到马萨诸塞州的詹姆斯·奥蒂斯，美国人表达了他们的抗议。殖民地召开了印花税法代表大会来决定该怎么做。

The colonists put their words into action and enacted widespread boycotts of British goods. Radical groups such as the Sons and Daughters of Liberty did not hesitate to harass tax collectors or publish the names of those who did not comply with the boycotts.
殖民者将他们的言论付诸行动，对英国商品进行了广泛的抵制。自由之子和自由之女等激进团体毫不犹豫地骚扰收税人员或公布那些不遵守抵制行动的人的名字。

Soon, the pressure on Parliament by business-starved British merchants was too great to bear. The Stamp Act was repealed the following year.
很快，缺乏生意的英国商人给议会带来了巨大的压力，难以承受。 《印花税法》于次年被废除。


Several issues remained unresolved. First, Parliament had absolutely no wish to send a message across the Atlantic that ultimate authority lay in the colonial legislatures. Immediately after repealing the Stamp Act, Parliament issued the Declaratory Act.
有几个问题仍未解决。首先，议会绝对不想向大西洋彼岸传递这样一个信息：最终权力属于殖民地立法机构。废除《印花税法》后，议会立即颁布了《宣言法》。

This act proclaimed Parliament's ability "to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever." The message was clear: under no circumstances did Parliament abandon in principle its right to legislate for the 13 colonies.
该法案宣称议会有能力“在任何情况下约束殖民地”。传达的信息很明确：议会在任何情况下原则上都不会放弃为 13 个殖民地立法的权利。


Most American statesmen had drawn a clear line between legislation and taxation. In 1766, the notion of Parliamentary supremacy over the law was questioned only by a radical few, but the ability to tax without representation was another matter. The DECLARATORY ACT made no such distinction. "All cases whatsoever" could surely mean the power to tax.
大多数美国政治家在立法和税收之间划出了明确的界限。 1766 年，议会凌驾于法律之上的理念只受到少数激进分子的质疑，但在没有代表的情况下征税的能力则是另一回事。 《声明法》没有做出这样的区分。 “无论何种情况”肯定意味着征税的权力。


Sure enough, the "truce" did not last long. Back in London, CHARLES TOWNSHEND persuaded the HOUSE OF COMMONS to once again tax the Americans, this time through an import tax on such items as glass, paper, lead, and tea.
果然，“休战”并没有持续多久。回到伦敦，查尔斯·汤森说服下议院再次对美国人征税，这次是对玻璃、纸张、铅和茶叶等物品征收进口税。

Townshend had ulterior motives, however. The revenue from these duties would now be used to pay the salaries of colonial governors. This was not an insignificant change. Traditionally, the legislatures of the colonies held the authority to pay the governors. It was not uncommon for a governor's salary to be withheld if the legislature became dissatisfied with any particular decision. The legislature could, in effect, blackmail the governor into submission. Once this important leverage was removed, the governors could be freer to oppose the assemblies.
然而，汤森德别有用心。这些关税的收入现在将用于支付殖民地总督的工资。这并不是一个微不足道的变化。传统上，殖民地的立法机关有权向总督支付工资。如果立法机关对任何特定决定不满意，州长的工资被扣留的情况并不少见。事实上，立法机关可以勒索州长，迫使其屈服。一旦这个重要的杠杆被消除(即法律强制规定, 殖民地立法机关不再对殖民地总督具有薪水控制权, 那么总督就可以不受立法机关的控制了)，州长们就可以更自由地反对议会。

In a CIRCULAR LETTER to the other colonies, the Massachusetts legislature recommended collective action against the British Parliament. Parliament, in turn, threatened to disband the body unless they repealed the letter. By a vote of 92 to 17, the Massachusetts lawmakers refused and were duly dissolved. Other colonial assemblies voiced support of Massachusetts by affirming the circular letter.
在给其他殖民地的通函中，马萨诸塞州立法机构建议对英国议会采取集体行动。反过来，议会威胁要解散该机构，除非他们废除这封信。马萨诸塞州立法者以 92 比 17 的投票结果拒绝了这一提议，并正式解散。其他殖民地议会通过确认这封通函来表达对马萨诸塞州的支持。

The partial repeal of the Townshend Acts did not bring the same reaction in the American colonies as the repeal of the Stamp Act. Too much had already happened. Not only had the Crown attempted to tax the colonies on several occasions, but two taxes were still being collected — one on sugar and one on tea.
汤森法案的部分废除并没有在美洲殖民地引起与印花法案废除相同的反应。已经发生了太多事情。国王不仅多次试图向殖民地征税，而且仍在征收两项税——一项针对糖，一项针对茶叶。



Throughout the colonies, the message was clear: what could happen in Massachusetts could happen anywhere. The British had gone too far. Supplies were sent to the beleaguered colony from the other twelve. For the first time since the Stamp Act Crisis, an intercolonial conference was called.
在整个殖民地，信息很明确：马萨诸塞州可能发生的事情也可能发生在任何地方。英国人走得太远了。其他十二个殖民地都向陷入困境的殖民地运送了补给品。自《印花税法案》危机以来，这是第一次召开殖民地间会议。

It was under these tense circumstances that the FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS convened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774.
正是在这种紧张的情况下，第一次大陆会议于 1774 年 9 月 5 日在费城召开。


The DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE was a product of the SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS. Two earlier intercolonial conferences had occurred, each building important keystones of colonial unity. The Stamp Act Congress and the First Continental Congress brought the delegates from differing colonies to agreement on a message to send to the king. Each successive Congress brought greater participation. Each time the representatives met, they were more accustomed to compromise. As times grew more desperate, the people at home became more and more willing to trust their national leaders.
《独立宣言》是第二次大陆会议的产物。此前曾举行过两次殖民间会议，每次会议都奠定了殖民地团结的重要基石。印花税法大会和第一届大陆会议使来自不同殖民地的代表就向国王发送的信息达成一致。每届大会都带来了更多的参与。每次代表们见面，他们都更习惯于妥协。随着时代变得越来越绝望，国内人民越来越愿意信任他们的国家领导人。


"No taxation without representation!" was the cry. The colonists were not merely griping about the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act. They intended to place actions behind their words. One thing was clear — no colony acting alone could effectively convey a message to the king and Parliament. The appeals to Parliament by the individual legislatures had been ignored. It was James Otis who suggested an intercolonial conference to agree on a united course of action. With that, the STAMP ACT CONGRESS convened in New York in October 1765.
“无代表不纳税！”是哭声。殖民者不仅仅抱怨《糖法》和《印花税法》。他们打算将行动置于言语之上。有一点是明确的——任何一个殖民地单独行动都无法有效地向国王和议会传达信息。个别立法机关向议会提出的呼吁遭到忽视。詹姆斯·奥蒂斯建议召开一次殖民间会议，以商定统一的行动方针。由此，印花税法大会于 1765 年 10 月在纽约召开。

The Congress seemed at first to be an abject failure. In the first place, only nine of the colonies sent delegates. Georgia, North Carolina, New Hampshire, and the all-important Virginia were not present. The Congress became quickly divided between radicals and moderates. The moderates would hold sway at this time. Only an extreme few believed in stronger measures against Britain than articulating the principle of no taxation without representation. This became the spirit of the STAMP ACT RESOLVES. The Congress humbly acknowledged Parliament's right to make laws in the colonies. Only the issue of taxation was disputed.
大会起初似乎是一次彻底的失败。首先，只有九个殖民地派出了代表。佐治亚州、北卡罗来纳州、新罕布什尔州和最重要的弗吉尼亚州没有出席。国会很快就分裂为激进派和温和派。此时温和派将占据主导地位。只有极少数人相信对英国采取比阐明无代表不纳税原则更强有力的措施。这成为《印花税法案决议》的精神。国会谦卑地承认议会在殖民地制定法律的权利。只有税收问题存在争议。

Colonial and personal differences already began to surface. A representative from New Jersey stormed out during the proceedings. The president of the Congress, TIMOTHY RUGGLES of Massachusetts, refused to sign the Stamp Act Resolves. In the end, however, the spirit of the Congress prevailed. Every colonial legislature except one approved the Stamp Act Resolves.
殖民地和个人差异已经开始显现。新泽西州的一名代表在诉讼过程中怒气冲冲地离场。国会主席、马萨诸塞州的蒂莫西·拉格尔斯拒绝签署《印花税法决议》。然而，最终大会的精神占了上风。除一个殖民地立法机构外，所有殖民地立法机构都批准了《印花税法决议》。

In the end, the widespread boycotts enacted by individual colonists surely did more to secure the repeal of the Stamp Act than did the Congress itself. But the gesture was significant. For the first time, against all odds, respected delegates from differing colonies sat with each other and engaged in spirited debate. They discovered that in many ways they had more in common than they originally had thought. This is a tentative but essential step toward the unity that would be necessary to declare boldly their independence from mother England.
最终，个别殖民者发起的广泛抵制无疑比国会本身对《印花税法》的废除起到了更大的作用。但这一举动意义重大。尽管困难重重，来自不同殖民地的受人尊敬的代表们第一次坐在一起，进行了激烈的辩论。他们发现，在很多方面，他们的共同点比他们最初想象的要多。这是迈向统一的试探性但重要的一步，对于大胆宣布脱离母国英格兰独立是必要的。


They were the ones who were not afraid. They knew instinctively that talk and politics alone would not bring an end to British tyranny. They were willing to resort to extralegal means if necessary to end this series of injustices.
他们是那些不害怕的人。他们本能地知道，仅靠言论和政治无法结束英国的暴政。如果有必要，他们愿意诉诸法律外的手段来结束这一系列的不公正行为。

Of course, the winners write the history books. Had the American Revolution failed, the Sons and Daughters of Liberty would no doubt be regarded as a band of thugs, or at the very least, outspoken troublemakers. History will be on their sides, however. These individuals risked their lives and reputations to fight against tyranny. In the end, they are remembered as heroes.
当然，历史书是由胜利者书写的。如果美国革命失败，自由之子(反英的秘密组织之一)无疑会被视为一群暴徒，或者至少会被视为直言不讳的麻烦制造者。然而，历史将站在他们一边。这些人冒着生命和名誉的危险与暴政作斗争。最终，他们作为英雄被人们铭记。



In the summer that followed Parliament's attempt to punish Boston, sentiment for the patriot cause increased dramatically.
在英国议会试图惩罚波士顿之后的那个夏天，爱国主义事业的情绪急剧上升。

There was agreement that this new quandary warranted another intercolonial meeting. It was nearly ten years since the Stamp Act Congress had assembled.
大家一致认为，这一新的困境需要召开另一次殖民间会议。印花税法案国会召开已有近十年了。

It was time once again for intercolonial action. Thus, on September 5, 1774, the First Continental Congress was convened in Philadelphia.
又到了殖民地间采取行动的时候了。于是，1774年9月5日，第一届大陆会议在费城召开。



This time participation was better. Only Georgia withheld a delegation. The representatives from each colony were often selected by almost arbitrary means, as the election of such representatives was illegal.
这次的参与度比较好。只有格鲁吉亚没有派出代表团。每个殖民地的代表往往是通过近乎任意的方式选出的，因为选举这些代表是非法的。

Still, the natural leaders of the colonies managed to be selected.
尽管如此，殖民地的自然领袖还是被选出了。

First and most obvious, complete nonimportation was resumed. The Congress set up an organization called the Association to ensure compliance in the colonies.
首先也是最明显的是，恢复了完全禁止进口。国会成立了一个名为“协会”的组织，以确保殖民地的遵守。

A declaration of colonial rights was drafted and sent to London. Much of the debate revolved around defining the colonies' relationship with mother England.
起草了一份殖民权利宣言并发送给伦敦。大部分争论都围绕着定义殖民地与英格兰母亲的关系展开。

A plan introduced by JOSEPH GALLOWAY of Pennsylvania proposed an imperial union with Britain. Under this program, all acts of Parliament would have to be approved by an American assembly to take effect.
宾夕法尼亚州的约瑟夫·加洛威提出的一项计划提议与英国建立帝国联盟。根据该计划，议会的所有法案都必须得到美国议会的批准才能生效。

Such an arrangement, if accepted by London, might have postponed revolution. But the delegations voted against it — by one vote.
这样的安排如果被伦敦接受，可能会推迟革命。但各代表团以一票之差投了反对票。


One decision by the Congress often overlooked in importance is its decision to reconvene in May 1775 if their grievances were not addressed. This is a major step in creating an ongoing intercolonial decision making body, unprecedented in colonial history.
国会做出的一项经常被忽视的重要决定是，如果他们的不满得不到解决，它将在 1775 年 5 月重新召开会议。这是建立一个持续的殖民间决策机构的重要一步，这在殖民历史上是前所未有的。

When Parliament chose to ignore the Congress, they did indeed reconvene that next May, but by this time boycotts were no longer a major issue. Unfortunately, the Second Continental Congress would be grappling with choices caused by the spilling of blood at Lexington and Concord the previous month.
当议会选择忽视国会时，他们确实在明年五月重新召开了会议，但此时抵制已不再是一个主要问题。不幸的是，第二届大陆会议将面临上个月列克星敦和康科德的流血事件所造成的选择。

It was at CARPENTERS' HALL that America came together politically for the first time on a national level and where the seeds of participatory democracy were sown.
正是在卡普特斯大厅，美国首次在国家层面上在政治上聚集在一起，并播下了参与式民主的种子。

In May 1775, with Redcoats once again storming Boston, the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia.
1775 年 5 月，英国军人再次袭击波士顿，第二次大陆会议在费城召开。

The questions were different this time. First and foremost, how would the colonist meet the military threat of the British. It was agreed that a CONTINENTAL ARMY would be created. The Congress commissioned George Washington of Virginia to be the supreme commander, who chose to serve without pay. How would supplies be paid for? The Congress authorized the printing of money. Before the leaves had turned, Congress had even appointed a standing committee to conduct relations with foreign governments, should the need ever arise to ask for help. No longer was the Congress dealing with mere grievances. It was a full-fledged governing body.
这次的问题有所不同。首先也是最重要的，殖民者将如何应对英国的军事威胁。会议同意建立一支大陆军。国会任命弗吉尼亚州的乔治·华盛顿为最高统帅，他选择无薪服役。物资如何支付？国会授权印钞。在休假之前，国会甚至任命了一个常设委员会来处理与外国政府的关系，以便在需要时寻求帮助。国会不再仅仅处理不满。这是一个成熟的管理机构。

Still, in May of 1775 the majority of delegates were not seeking independence from Britain. Only radicals like John Adams were of this mindset. In fact, that July Congress approved the OLIVE BRANCH PETITION, a direct appeal to the king. The American delegates pleaded with George III to attempt peaceful resolution and declared their loyalty to the Crown. The King refused to receive this petition and instead declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion in August. Insult turned to injury when George ordered the hiring of HESSIAN mercenaries to bring the colonists under control. Americans now felt less and less like their English brethren. How could their fellow citizens order a band of ruthless, foreign goons? The moderate voice in the Continental Congress was dealt a serious blow.
尽管如此，1775 年 5 月，大多数代表并没有寻求脱离英国独立。只有像约翰·亚当斯这样的激进分子才有这种心态。事实上，那年七月国会批准了橄榄枝请愿书，直接向国王提出请求。美国代表恳求乔治三世尝试和平解决问题，并宣布效忠英国王室。国王拒绝接受这份请愿书，并于八月宣布殖民地处于叛乱状态。当乔治下令雇佣黑森雇佣兵来控制殖民者时，侮辱变成了伤害。美国人现在感觉越来越不像他们的英国同胞了。他们的同胞怎么能命令一群残忍的外国暴徒呢？大陆会议中的温和派声音受到严重打击。


As the seasons changed and hostilities continued, cries for independence grew stronger. The men in Philadelphia were now wanted for treason. They continued to govern and hope against hope that all would end well. For them, the summer of 1776 brought the point of no return — a formal declaration of independence.
随着季节的变化和敌对行动的持续，要求独立的呼声越来越强烈。费城的这些人现在因叛国罪被通缉。他们继续执政，并希望一切都会有好结果。对他们来说，1776 年夏天是一个无法回头的时刻——正式宣布独立。

Americans could not break their ties with Britain easily. Despite all the recent hardships, the majority of colonists since birth were reared to believe that England was to be loved and its monarch revered.
美国人无法轻易断绝与英国的联系。尽管最近经历了种种困难，但大多数殖民者自出生起就相信英格兰值得热爱，其君主值得尊敬。

Fear was another factor. Any student of history was familiar with the harsh manner the British employed on Irish rebels. A revolution could bring mob rule, and no one, not even the potential mob, wanted that. Furthermore, despite taxes, times were good. Arguments can be made that average American was more prosperous than the average Briton.
恐惧是另一个因素。任何学习历史的学生都熟悉英国人对爱尔兰叛乱分子采取的严厉手段。一场革命可能会带来暴民统治，但没有人，甚至是潜在的暴民，愿意这样。此外，尽管有税收，但日子还是过得很好。可以说，普通美国人比普通英国人更富裕。

Yet there were the terrible injustices the colonists could not forget. Americans were divided against themselves. Arguments for independence were growing. Thomas Paine would provide the extra push.
然而，殖民者却无法忘记那些可怕的不公正现象。美国人内部存在分裂。支持独立的呼声越来越高。托马斯·潘恩将提供额外的推动力。


COMMON SENSE was an instant best-seller. Published in January 1776 in Philadelphia, nearly 120,000 copies were in circulation by April. Paine's brilliant arguments were straightforward. He argued for two main points: (1) independence from England and (2) the creation of a democratic republic.
《常识》立即成为畅销书。该书于 1776 年 1 月在费城出版，截至 4 月已发行近 120,000 册。潘恩的精彩论点直截了当。他主张两个要点：（1）脱离英国独立；（2）建立民主共和国。


In the end, his prose was common sense. Why should tiny England rule the vastness of a continent? How can colonists expect to gain foreign support while still professing loyalty to the British king? How much longer can Americans stand for the repeated abuses of the Crown? All these questions led many readers to one answer as the summer of 1776 drew near.
最后，他的散文是常识。为什么小小的英格兰要统治广阔的大陆呢？殖民者如何能在声称效忠英国国王的同时获得外国支持呢？美国人还能忍受国王一再滥用权力多久？随着 1776 年夏天的临近，所有这些问题让许多读者找到了一个答案。


The moment had finally come. Far too much bad blood existed between the colonial leaders and the crown to consider a return to the past. More and more colonists felt deprived by the British not only of their money and their civil liberties, but their lives as well. Bloodshed had begun over a year ago and there seemed little chance of a ceasefire. The radical wing of the Continental Congress was gaining strength with each passing day. It was time for a formal break with mother England. It was time to declare independence.
这一刻终于到来了。殖民地领导人和王室之间存在太多的不和，以至于无法考虑回到过去。越来越多的殖民者感到英国不仅剥夺了他们的金钱和公民自由，还剥夺了他们的生命。流血事件一年多前就开始了，停火的可能性似乎很小。大陆会议的激进派日益壮大。是时候与英格兰母亲正式决裂了。是时候宣布独立了。
