`主` The extraordinary conflict /that divided American life in the 1790s /`谓` *centered 把…当作中心；（使）成为中心 on* _divergent 不同的，分歧的 understandings_ of the meaning of the American Revolution /and how its legacy should *be nurtured* (v.)养育；养护；培养 in the new nation. +
`主` Arguments about that fundamental question /`谓` probably would have been controversial  (a.)有争议的，引发争论的 /under any circumstances, but were dramatically heightened /by the explosive example of the French Revolution. +
The United States was still _a fragile experiment_ /in republican government. +
Its domestic events and attitudes /would greatly *be shaped by* events in Europe.



[.my2]
1790 年代, **导致美国生活分裂的非同寻常的冲突, 集中在对"美国革命的意义", 以及"如何在新国家中培育其遗产"的不同理解上。**关于这个基本问题的争论, 在任何情况下都可能会引起争议，但法国大革命的爆炸性例子, 大大加剧了这一争论。**美国仍然是共和政府的一个脆弱的实验。**它的国内事件和态度, 将在很大程度上受到欧洲事件的影响。

.*centre around/on/round/upon sb/sth  | ˈcentre sth around/on/round/upon sb/sth*
to be or make sb/sth become the person or thing around which most activity, etc. takes place把…当作中心；（使）成为中心 +
• State occasions always centred around the king.国家庆典总是以国王为中心。 +

The deep conflict of the 1790s /stimulated a profound 巨大的；深切的；深远的 new development /in American politics. +
During the Revolution /`主` patriots 爱国者 `谓` *had expected, and even demanded, that* all _virtuous 品德高的；有道德的 people_ support (v.) them /in a cause 后定 they *saw as* _the only real force_ for the public good. +
Even into the 1790s, most Americans believed that /there could be only one legitimate position /to take [on political issues]. +
This helps /to explain _the rabid (a.)极端的；疯狂的 opinions_ of the period /that were set (v.) before the public /by _a remarkable growth_ in newspapers /during the decade. +
These newspapers did not *pretend /to be objective* (a.)客观的；就事论事的；不带个人感情的 /in how they reported (v.) events. +
Instead, newspapers sold  (v.) issues 一期；期号 /*because of* their _intense (a.)有强烈感情（或意见、想法）的；尖锐的；热切的 commitment_ to _a particular partisan (a.)（对某个人、团体或思想）过分支持的，偏护的，盲目拥护的 view_ of _the contentious events_ of the day.

[.my2]
1790年代的深刻冲突刺激了美国政治深刻的新发展。在革命期间，爱国者们期望，甚至要求所有有道德的人都支持他们的事业，他们认为这是实现公共利益的唯一真正力量。即使到了 1790 年代，大多数美国人仍然相信在政治问题上只能采取一种合法立场。这有助于解释这十年间报纸的显着增长向公众提出的狂热观点。这些报纸在报道事件时并不假装客观。相反，报纸之所以能卖出特刊，是因为它们对当天有争议的事件抱有特定的党派观点。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.rabid
(a.)
[ usually before noun] ( disapproving) ( of a type of person某类人 ) having very strong feelings about sth /and acting in an unacceptable way极端的；疯狂的 +
• rabid (a.) right-wing fanatics 极端的右翼狂热分子 +
• the rabid (a.) tabloid press 偏激的小报

Consider (v.)（尤指为作出决定而）仔细考虑，细想 these _diametrically 完全（不同）；截然（相反） opposed opinions_ about President Washington. +
A Federalist newspaper trumpeted (v.)宣扬；鼓吹；吹嘘, "Many _a private person_ might make _a great President_; but will *there ever be* a President /who will *make* _so great a man_ /*as* Washington?" Meanwhile, `主` a Democratic-Republican paper `谓` condemned (v.)（通常因道义上的原因而）谴责，指责 that same hero. +
"If ever a nation *was debauched* (v.)使堕落放纵 by a man, the American nation *has been debauched* by Washington. +

Let _the history of the federal government_ instruct (v.) mankind, that _the mask of patriotism_ may be worn (v.)穿，戴 /to conceal _the foulest 肮脏恶臭的；难闻的(最高级) designs_ /against the liberties of the people." As this newspaper suggests, most people believed that /their political enemies would destroy the nation /if allowed to hold power.

[.my2]
考虑一下这些关于华盛顿总统的截然相反的观点。一份《联邦党人》报纸大肆宣扬：“许多普通人都可能成为一位伟大的总统；但是会有一位总统能够成为像华盛顿这样伟大的人吗？”与此同时，一份民主共和党报纸谴责了这位英雄。 “如果有一个国家被一个人放荡，那么美国民族就被华盛顿放荡了……让联邦政府的历史告诉人类，爱国主义的面具可能会被戴上，以掩盖针对人民自由的最肮脏的图谋。人民。”正如本报所言，大多数人相信，如果允许他们的政敌掌权，就会毁灭国家。

It was JOHN ADAMS' misfortune /to be elected president /in these deeply divided times. +
_A genuine (a.)真的；名副其实的 patriot_ and _man of deep principle_, `主` domestic and international controversies 争论，争议 /`谓` placed (v.) nearly impossible challenges /before the second president. +
If even Washington *suffered* (v.) harsh public attack *from* opposition newspapers, imagine (v.) what they were prepared (a.) /to say about _the less imposing (a.)壮观的；使人印象深刻的 John Adams_.

[.my2]
在这个分裂严重的时代当选总统, 是约翰·亚当斯的不幸。作为一位真正的爱国者, 和有深刻原则的人，国内和国际争议, 给第二任总统带来了几乎不可能完成的挑战。*如果连华盛顿都受到反对派报纸的严厉公开攻击，那么想象一下, 他们准备对不那么威严的约翰·亚当斯说些什么。*

.JOHN ADAMS

By 1798 /`主` Adams and the FEDERALIST CONGRESS /`谓` passed a series of laws /that severely limited (v.) American _civil liberties_ 公民自由；公民权力. +
*Acting (v.) upon* 根据（建议、信息等）行事 their judgment /that _political critics_ *were* _treasonous 叛逆的；谋反的；犯叛国罪的 opponents_ 对手 of good government, `主` Adams `谓` followed (v.) the lead of _Congressional leaders_ /and heightened  (v.)（使）加强，提高，增加 _domestic repression_ 国内镇压. +

[.my2]
到了1798年，**亚当斯和"联邦党国会", 通过了一系列严重限制美国公民自由的法律。基于他们的判断，认为, 政治批评者是反对"良好政府"的叛徒**，亚当斯紧随国会领导的步伐，加强了国内的镇压。**亚当斯支持的政策, 后来被广泛认为违宪。**然而，他在自己的党内起到了缓和的作用，并拒绝利用战争威胁来利用爱国热情, 谋取个人利益。*我们如今的政治态度, 与亚当斯及其联邦党同僚在18世纪末的政治思想, 存在着巨大差距，这揭示了美国政治思想在那个十年发生的根本转变。*

=== 跨大西洋危机：法国大革命 Trans-Atlantic Crisis: The French Revolution


The French Revolution *brought* (v.) fundamental changes (n.) *to* _the feudal (a.)封建（制度）的 order_ of _monarchical (a.)君主的；帝王的；君主制的 and aristocratic (a.)贵族的 privilege_ （有钱有势者的）特权，特殊待遇.

Americans widely celebrated (v.) the French Revolution /in _its glorious opening_ in 1789, 因为 as *it struck (v.) at* _the very heart_ of ABSOLUTIST POWER.

France seemed /to be following (v.) the American republican example 样板；榜样 /by creating (v.) _a constitutional 宪法的；宪法规定的 monarchy (君主政体)_ 君主立宪制度 /where `主` _traditional elites_ `谓` would *be restrained* by written law.

Where the king *had previously held* absolute power, now he would have to *act* (v.)  within _clear legal boundaries_.

[.my2]
法国大革命, 使君主和贵族特权的封建秩序, 发生了根本性的变化。美国人广泛庆祝 1789 年法国大革命的光荣开幕，因为它击中了"专制主义"权力的核心。法国似乎效仿美国共和政体，建立了君主立宪制国家，传统精英, 将受到成文法律的约束。国王以前拥有绝对权力，但现在他必须在明确的法律范围内行事。


The FRENCH REVOLUTION /`谓` soon *moved (v.) beyond* this already _considerable assault_ (n.)攻击；突击；袭击;侵犯他人身体（罪）；侵犯人身罪 on _the traditional order_.

The French Revolution /became far more radical (a.)激进的；极端的 /*than* the American Revolution. +
*In addition to* 除了…之外 a period of _extreme public violence_, which *became known as* the REIGN OF TERROR, the French Revolution also *attempted* /to enhance (v.) _the rights and power_ of poor people and women.

In fact, it even *went so far* /*as to* 竟至, 竟然到...的地步,甚至 outlaw (v.)宣布…不合法；使…成为非法 slavery /in _the FRENCH COLONIES_ of the Caribbean.


[.my2]
法国大革命, 很快就超越了"对传统秩序本已相当大的攻击"。 *1792 年开始的针对普鲁士和奥地利的战争, 引发的危机, 在很大程度上推动了法国大革命*. +
法国大革命发生了戏剧性的转变，随着国王路易十六的斩首, 和放弃基督教转而支持一种基于理性的新国教，法国大革命达到了高潮。**法国大革命比美国革命更加激进。除了被称为恐怖统治的极端公共暴力时期外，法国大革命还试图增强穷人和妇女的权利和权力。**事实上，它甚至禁止加勒比法属殖民地的奴隶制。

[.my1]

While `主` the French Revolution `谓` *had initially received* broad support /in the United States, `主` its radicalization 激进，激进化 in 1792-1793 /`谓` *led to* sharp disagreement /in American opinion 意见；想法；看法;（群体的）观点，信仰.

[.my2]
法国大革命引发的深刻变革, 对法国及其引发的 1792 年至 1815 年间的大规模欧洲战争, 产生了巨大影响。它还帮助改变了 1790 年代中期开始的美国政治。虽然法国大革命, 最初在美国得到了广泛的支持，但其在 1792 年至 1793 年的激进化, 导致了美国舆论对其的尖锐分歧。



Domestic 国内的 attitudes (n.) toward _the proper future_ of _the American republic_ /`谓` grew even more intense (a.)严肃紧张的；激烈的;有强烈感情（或意见、想法）的；尖锐的；热切的 /*as a result of* the example of revolutionary France.

When Great Britain *joined* European allies /in the war against France in 1793, Federalists supported (v.) this action /*as* an attempt /to enforce (v.) _proper 正确的；恰当的；符合规则的 order_.

[.my2]
由于革命法国的榜样，国内对"美利坚共和国的正确未来"的态度, 变得更加强烈。汉密尔顿、华盛顿等保守派人士, 以及其他很快组织起来的联邦党, 将法国大革命视为"杀人无政府状态的"一个例子。 1793 年，当英国与欧洲盟友一起对抗法国时，联邦党人支持这一行动，认为这是强制执行适当秩序的尝试。

`主` The opposing (a.)对立的；相竞争的；对抗的 _American view_, held by men like Jefferson /and others 后定 who came to organize as _the Democratic-Republican political party_, `谓` #supported# (v.) French actions *as* an extension of _a world-wide republican struggle_ against _corrupt monarchy and aristocratic privilege_.

[.my2]
美国的反对观点, 是由杰斐逊等人组成的民主共和党政党所持，他们支持法国的行动，将其视为"全世界共和主义"反对"腐败君主制和贵族特权"的斗争的延伸。

The example of the French Revolution /helped *#convince#* (v.)使确信；使相信；使信服 Americans /on both sides /#*that*# `主` their political opponents /`谓` *were motivated (v.) by* dangerous and even evil forces /后定 that *threatened* to destroy the young republic.

[.my2]
法国大革命的例子, 帮助双方的美国人相信，他们的政治对手(即"政府"和"批评政府者"彼此认为对方)是受到危险甚至邪恶势力的驱使，这些势力威胁要摧毁这个年轻的共和国。

While France had aided the U.S. /during the American Revolution, America would not do the same /for France.

[.my2]
华盛顿总统宣布. +
美国在法国战争中保持中立，违反了 1778 年与法国签订的两国互助条约的条款。虽然法国在美国革命期间援助了美国，但美国不会为法国提供同样的援助。

=== "联邦党"的反对党 -- "民主共和党"出现. (犹如台湾的"国民党"的反对党 -- "民进党"出现) 即两党诞生 Two Parties Emerge


The ELECTION OF 1796 /*was* the first election /in American history /where political CANDIDATES _at the local, state, and national level_ /*began* to run for OFFICE /as members of _organized political parties_ /that held strongly opposed political principles.

[.my2]
1796 年的选举, 是美国历史上的第一次选举，地方、州, 和国家各级的政治候选人, 开始作为持有强烈反对政治原则的有组织政党的成员, 竞选公职。

This was a stunning 令人惊奇万分的；令人震惊的;极有魅力的；绝妙的；给人以深刻印象的 new phenomenon 现象 /that shocked most of the older leaders of the Revolutionary Era. +
Even Madison, who was one of the earliest /to see the value of political parties, believed that /they would only *serve as* temporary coalitions 联合；结合；联盟 /for specific controversial 有争议的，引发争论的 elections. +

The older leaders /failed to understand the dynamic (a.)充满活力的；精力充沛的；个性强的 new conditions /that had been created /by the importance of _popular sovereignty_ 主权；最高统治权；最高权威 — democracy 民主政体；民主制度 — to the American Revolution. +
The people now *understood themselves as* a fundamental force /in legitimating government authority. +

In the modern American political system, voters mainly express (v.) themselves /*through* allegiances (n.)（对政党、宗教、统治者的）忠诚，效忠，拥戴 within _a competitive party system_. +
1796 was the first election /where _this defining (a.)最典型的；起决定性作用的 element_ of _modern political life_ /began to appear.

[.my2]
这是一个惊人的新现象，震惊了革命时代的大多数老领导人。**即使是最早看到政党价值的人之一麦迪逊，也认为政党只能在有争议的特定选举中, 充当"临时联盟"。老一辈领导人未能理解"人民主权"——民主——对美国革命的重要性所创造的充满活力的新条件。人民现在认识到, 自己是使政府权威"合法化"的基本力量。在现代美国政治制度中，选民主要通过在"竞争激烈的政党制度"中效忠, 来表达自己。**1796年, 是现代政治生活的决定性因素, 首次出现的选举。

The two parties adopted (v.)采用（某方法）；采取（某态度） names /that reflected their _most cherished (a.)珍爱的，珍藏的 values_. +
The Federalists 联邦党人 of 1796 /① `谓` *attached 把…固定，把…附（在…上） themselves to* the successful campaign /*in favor of* 支持；赞同；偏向于 the Constitution /and ② `系` *were* solid supporters of _the federal administration_ 联邦行政机构. +
Although Washington *denounced* 谴责；指责；斥责 parties *as* _a horrid 可怕的；恐怖的；极讨厌 threat_ to the republic, his _vice president_ John Adams /became _the *de facto* 实际上存在的（不一定合法） presidential candidate_ of the Federalists. +

The party had its strongest support /among those who favored Hamilton's policies. +
Merchants 商人, creditors 债权人,债主；贷方 and urban artisans /who built (v.) _the growing commercial economy_ of the northeast /provided (v.) its _most dedicated 献身的：专心致志的；一心一意的 supporters_ and _strongest regional support_.

[.my2]
两党采用的名字, 都反映他们最珍视的价值观。 1796 年的联邦党人, 致力于支持宪法的成功运动，并且是"联邦政府"的坚定支持者。尽管华盛顿谴责政党是对共和国的可怕威胁，但他的副总统约翰·亚当斯, 成为"联邦党"事实上的总统候选人。该党在支持汉密尔顿政策的人中, 得到了最强有力的支持。商人、债权人, 和城市工匠, 为东北不断发展的商业经济提供了最忠实的支持者, 和最强有力的地区支持。



_The opposition party_ adopted (v.) the name DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICANS, which suggested that /they were more fully committed /*to extending* the Revolution *to* ordinary people. +

The supporters of the Democratic-Republicans (often referred to as the Republicans) /① *were drawn /from* many segments of American society / ② and included (v.) farmers 后定 throughout 各处；遍及 the country /with _high popularity_ among _German and Scots-Irish 有苏格兰-爱尔兰血统的 ethnic groups_. +

Although it effectively reached (v.) ordinary citizens, its _key leaders_ /*were* _wealthy southern tobacco elites_ like Jefferson and Madison. +
#尽管# While the Democratic-Republicans *were* more diverse (a.)不同的，各式各样的, /#但是# the Federalists *were* wealthier /and *carried* more prestige 声望，威信, especially *by association with* 联合；合伙；关联；交往 _the retired (a.) Washington_.

[.my2]
**反对党则采用了"民主共和党"的名称，这表明他们更加致力于将革命, 扩展到普通民众。**民主共和党（通常被称为"*共和党"）的支持者, 来自美国社会的许多阶层，包括全国各地的农民*，在德国和苏格兰-爱尔兰族群中, 颇受欢迎。尽管它有效地影响了普通公民，但其主要领导人, 是杰斐逊和麦迪逊等富有的南方烟草精英。**虽然"民主共和党"更加多元化，但"联邦党"更加富有, 并且拥有更高的威望，**特别是通过与退休的华盛顿本人的联系。

The 1796 election /was waged (v.)开始，发动，进行，继续（战争、战斗等） with _uncommon 不寻常的，罕有的 intensity_ 强烈；紧张；剧烈. +
Federalists *thought of* themselves *as* the "friends of order" and good government. +
They *viewed* (v.) their opponents *as* dangerous radicals 激进分子 /who would *bring* the anarchy 无政府状态；混乱，无秩序 of the French Revolution *to* America.

[.my2]
1796 年的选举, 异常激烈。*联邦党人认为自己是“秩序之友”和好政府。他们认为他们的对手, 是危险的激进分子，他们会将"法国大革命"的无政府状态, 带到美国。*

[.my2]
"民主共和党"鄙视"联邦党"的政策。据纽约一份"共和党"倾向的报纸报道，联邦党人是“贵族，致力于为'君主政体'奠定基础，而'共和党人'是独立的真正支持者，平等权利的朋友，以及'自由选举'政府的热情拥护者”。

=== 亚当斯总统任期 (美国第二任总统) The Adams Presidency

The Adams administration /*faced* several _severe tests_ 严峻考验. +
It was a mixed administration. +
Adams was a Federalist. +
Jefferson, the vice-president, was a Democratic-Republican. +

Federalists *were increasingly divided* /#between# CONSERVATIVES 保守党，保守派 *such as* Hamilton #and# MODERATES 持温和观点者（尤指政见） *such as* Adams /who still *saw himself as* above _party politics_.

[.my2]
亚当斯政府面临多重严峻考验。这是一个混合政府。亚当斯是"联邦党"人。副总统杰斐逊是"民主共和党"人。联邦党人在汉密尔顿等保守派, 和亚当斯等温和派之间, 日益分裂，后者仍然认为自己凌驾于政党政治之上。

Beyond these _considerable 相当多（或大、重要等）的 problems_ in his own party, Adams also *faced* a major _international crisis_. +
The French *were outraged 使震怒；激怒 /by* what they *viewed as* an ANGLO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE 联盟，结盟 /in Jay's Treaty.

[.my2]
除了党内的这些重大问题之外，亚当斯还面临着重大的国际危机。法国人对他们所认为的"杰伊条约"中的英美联盟, 感到愤怒。

亚当斯为应对法国的外国威胁, 而采取的强有力措施还包括 : 严厉镇压国内抗议活动。 1798 年，联邦党国会通过了一系列统称为《外国人和煽动叛乱法》的法律，并由亚当斯总统签署成为法律。这些法律包括驱逐外国人的新权力，并加大新移民投票的难度。此前，新移民必须在美国居住五年才有资格投票，但新法律将这一期限提高到了 14 年。

=== 杰斐逊主义的美国：第二次革命？(托马斯·杰斐逊 : 美国第三任总统) Jeffersonian America: A Second Revolution?

The harsh public antagonism of the 1790s largely came to an end with the victory of the Democratic- Republicans in the 1800 election.

[.my2]
随着"民主共和党"在 1800 年选举中的胜利，1790 年代激烈的公众对抗基本上结束了。

To Jefferson and his supporters, the defeat of the Federalists ended their attempt to lead America on a more conservative and less democratic course. +
Since the Federalists never again played a national political role after the defeat in 1800, it seems that most American voters of the era shared Jefferson's view.

[.my2]
对于杰斐逊(民主共和党人)和他的支持者来说，联邦党人的失败, 结束了他们领导美国走上更加保守和民主的道路的尝试。由于联邦党在 1800 年失败后, 再也没有发挥过国家政治作用，似乎那个时代的大多数美国选民都同意杰斐逊的观点。

====

Jefferson's election inaugurated a "VIRGINIA DYNASTY" that held the presidency from 1801 to 1825. +
After Jefferson's two terms as president, he was followed by two other two-term Democratic-Republicans from Virginia, James Madison and James Monroe.

[.my2]
杰斐逊的当选开启了“弗吉尼亚王朝”，从 1801 年到 1825 年担任总统。杰斐逊连任两届总统后，紧随其后的是另外两位来自弗吉尼亚州的民主共和党人, 詹姆斯·麦迪逊, 和詹姆斯·门罗。

The CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT throughout the JEFFERSONIAN ERA, JOHN MARSHALL, was an ardent Federalist. +
Even while his political opponents controlled elected national office, Marshall consistently supported the supremacy of national power over the states. +
He led the court in establishing legal precedents to support this view.

[.my2]
整个杰斐逊时代的最高法院首席大法官约翰·马歇尔是一位热心的联邦党人。即使他的政治对手控制了民选国家公职，马歇尔始终支持国家权力高于各州。他领导法院确立了支持这一观点的法律先例。

JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA is a term that helps us enter the contested and deeply contradictory nature of the United States at the start of the 19th century. +
Grappling fully with its meaning requires the use of sophisticated analytical skills that assess both its strengths and its weaknesses. +
To merely celebrate or condemn, seeing one side, but not the other, is to judge without attempting to understand.

[.my2]
“杰斐逊美国”这个术语, 可以帮助我们了解 19 世纪初, 美国充满争议和深刻矛盾的本质。充分理解其含义, 需要使用复杂的分析技能, 来评估其优点和缺点。仅仅称赞或谴责，只看到一面, 而没看到另一面，这种做法就是在不试图先理解的情况下就来做出判断。(没有调查, 就没有发言权)

Seeing how the best and the worst of Jeffersonian America were deeply intermixed, and continue to inform American life in our transformed circumstances of the 21st century, is among the most important purposes of historical inquiry.

[.my2]
历史探究最重要的目的之一, 是了解杰斐逊时代, 美国最好的事物, 和最坏的事物, 是如何深深地混合在一起的，并继续影响着今天我们21世纪变化环境中的美国人的生活。


Jefferson's most fundamental political belief was an "absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the MAJORITY." Stemming from his deep optimism in human reason, Jefferson believed that the WILL OF THE PEOPLE, expressed through elections, provided the most appropriate guidance for directing the republic's course.

[.my2]
杰斐逊最基本的政治信念是“绝对默许多数人的决定”。由于他对人类理性的深刻乐观，杰斐逊相信，通过选举表达的人民意志, 为"指导共和国的进程"提供了最适当的指导。


Jefferson also felt that the central government should be "rigorously frugal and simple." As president he reduced the size and scope of the federal government by ending internal taxes, reducing the size of the army and navy, and paying off the government's debt. +
Limiting the federal government flowed from his strict interpretation of the Constitution.

[.my2]
杰斐逊还认为, 中央政府应该“严格节俭、简朴”。作为总统，他通过终止内部税收、减少陆军和海军的规模, 以及偿还政府债务, 来缩小联邦政府的规模和范围。对联邦政府的限制, 源于他对宪法的严格解释。

Finally, Jefferson also committed his presidency to the protection of civil liberties and minority rights. +
As he explained in his INAUGURAL ADDRESS IN 1801, "though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, and to violate would be oppression." Jefferson's experience of Federalist repression in the late 1790s led him to more clearly define a central concept of American democracy.

[.my2]
最后，杰斐逊还承诺, 在其总统任期内保护公民自由和少数群体权利。正如他在 1801 年的就职演说中所解释的那样，“虽然在所有情况下, 多数人的意志都会占上风，但这种意志若要合法，就必须是合理的；少数人拥有平等的权利，平等的法律必须保护这些权利，并且如果违反这些法律, 那就意味着压迫。”杰斐逊在 1790 年代末遭受联邦党镇压的经历, 使他更清晰地定义了"美国民主"的核心概念。


His crucial sense of what mattered most in life grew from a deep appreciation of farming, in his mind the most virtuous and meaningful human activity.

[.my2]
他对生活中最重要的东西的关键认识, 来自于对农业的深刻欣赏，在他看来，农业是最高尚、最有意义的人类活动。

he saw two dangerous threats to his ideal AGRARIAN DEMOCRACY. +
To him, financial speculation and the development of urban industry both threatened to rob men of the independence that they maintained as farmers. +
Debt, on the one hand, and factory work, on the other, could rob men of the economic autonomy essential for republican citizens.

[.my2]
他看到了对他理想的"农业民主"的两个危险威胁。对他来说，"金融投机"和"城市工业"的发展, 都威胁着剥夺人们作为农民所维持的独立性。一方面, 债务, 和另一方面的工厂工作, 可能会剥夺人们对共和国的公民至关重要的"经济自主权"。

Jefferson's vision was not anti-modern, for he had too brilliant a scientific mind to fear technological change. +
He supported INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE to benefit farmers and wanted to see new TECHNOLOGY widely incorporated into ordinary farms and households to make them more productive.

[.my2]
杰斐逊的愿景并不"反现代"，因为他拥有卓越的科学头脑，不会担心技术变革。他支持国际商业造福农民，并希望看到新技术能广泛融入普通农场和家庭，以提高他们的生产力。


Jefferson pinpointed a deeply troubling problem. +
How could REPUBLICAN LIBERTY and DEMOCRATIC EQUALITY be reconciled with social changes that threatened to increase inequality? The awful working conditions in early industrial England loomed as a terrifying example. +
For Jefferson, western expansion provided an escape from the British model. +
As long as hard working farmers could acquire land at reasonable prices, then America could prosper as a republic of equal and independent citizens. +
Jefferson's ideas helped to inspire a mass political movement that achieved many key aspects of his plan.

[.my2]
*杰斐逊指出了一个令人深感不安的问题。"共和党的自由, 和民主党的平等", 如何与"可能加剧不平等的社会变革"相协调?* 早期工业化的英国, 其糟糕的工作环境, 就是一个可怕的例子。对杰斐逊来说，西部扩张能让他摆脱英国模式。只要辛勤工作的农民, 能够以合理的价格获得土地，那么美国就可以作为一个平等和独立公民的共和国, 而繁荣昌盛。杰斐逊的想法, 帮助激发了一场大规模的政治运动，实现了他的计划的许多关键方面。

In spite of the success and importance of Jeffersonian Democracy, dark flaws limited even Jefferson's grand vision. +
First, his hopes for the incorporation of technology at the household level failed to grasp how poverty often pushed women and children to the forefront of the new industrial labor. +
Second, an equal place for Native Americans could not be accommodated within his plans for an agrarian republic. +
Third, Jefferson's celebration of agriculture disturbingly ignored the fact that slaves worked the richest farm land in the United States. +
Slavery was obviously incompatible with true democratic values. +
Jefferson's explanation of slaves within the republic argued that African Americans' racial inferiority barred them from becoming full and equal citizens.

[.my2]
尽管杰斐逊式民主, 取得了成功和重要性，但黑暗的缺陷, 甚至限制了杰斐逊的宏伟愿景。首先，他希望在家庭层面上结合技术，但他没能理解, 贫困是如何将妇女和儿童推到新工业劳动力的最前沿的。其次，他的农业共和国计划, 无法为美洲原住民提供平等的地位。第三，杰斐逊对农业的颂扬, 令人不安地忽视了"美国最肥沃的农田中, 存在着用奴隶来耕作"这个事实。奴隶制显然与真正的民主价值观不相容。杰斐逊对"共和国境内存在奴隶"的解释是，非洲裔美国人的种族劣势, 使他们无法成为完全平等的公民。


Our final assessment of Jeffersonian Democracy rests on a profound contradiction. +
Jefferson was the single most powerful individual leading the struggle to enhance the rights of ordinary people in the early republic. +
Furthermore, his Declaration of Independence had eloquently expressed America's statement of purpose "that all men are created equal." Still, he owned slaves all his life and, unlike Washington, never set them free.

[.my2]
我们对杰斐逊民主的最终评估, 建立在一个深刻的矛盾之上。杰斐逊是"共和初期, 在领导提高普通人权利斗争"中, 最有权势的人。此外，在他的《独立宣言》, 雄辩地表达了美国“人人生而平等”的宗旨。尽管如此，他一生都拥有奴隶，并且与华盛顿不同的是，他从未释放过他们。

For all his greatness, Jefferson did not transcend the pervasive racism of his day.

[.my2]
尽管杰斐逊非常伟大，但他并没有超越他那个时代普遍存在的"种族主义"。


Jefferson's plans for the nation depended upon western expansion and access to international markets for American farm products. +
This vision was threatened, however, when France regained control of Louisiana. +
NAPOLEON, who had now risen to power in the French Revolution, threatened to block American access to the important port of New Orleans on the Mississippi River. +
New American settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains depended upon river transport to get their goods to market since overland trade to the east was expensive and impractical.

[.my2]
杰斐逊的国家计划, 取决于西部扩张, 和美国农产品进入国际市场的机会。然而，当法国重新控制"路易斯安那"时，这一愿景受到了威胁。在法国大革命中掌权的拿破仑, 威胁要阻止美国进入密西西比河上的重要港口"新奥尔良"。阿巴拉契亚山脉以西的新美国定居点, 依靠河流运输将货物运往市场，因为东部的陆路贸易, 既昂贵又不切实际。



Blocking American access to New Orleans was such a grave threat to American interests that President Jefferson considered changing his traditional foreign policy stance to an anti-French alliance with the British. +
At the same time that he sent diplomats to France to bargain for continued trade access along the Mississippi, he also sent diplomats to Britain to pursue other policy options. +
James Monroe, the top person negotiating in Paris, was empowered to purchase New Orleans and West Florida for between two and ten million dollars.

[.my2]
阻止美国进入"新奥尔良", 对美国利益构成如此严重的威胁，以至于杰斐逊总统考虑改变其传统的外交政策立场，转而与英国结成反法联盟。在他派遣外交官前往法国, 就密西西比河沿岸继续贸易准入, 进行谈判的同时，他还派遣外交官前往英国, 寻求其他政策选择。巴黎谈判的最高人物詹姆斯·门罗(美国外交官), 被授权以两到一千万美元, 购买"新奥尔良"和"西佛罗里达"。

Surprisingly, however, Napoleon offered much more. +
He was militarily overextended and needing money to continue his war against Britain. +
Knowing full well that he could not force Americans out of the land France possessed in North America, Napoleon offered all of LOUISIANA to the U.S. +
for 15 million dollars. +
The massive territory stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and more than doubled the size of the United States.

[.my2]
然而，令人惊讶的是，拿破仑提供的远不止于此。他的军事扩张过度，需要资金来继续对英国的战争。拿破仑深知自己无法迫使美国人离开法国在北美拥有的土地，因此以 1500 万美元的价格, 将整个路易斯安那送给美国。这片广阔的领土从密西西比河一直延伸到落基山脉，是美国面积的两倍多。


Napoleon's asking price worked out to be about four cents an acre.

[.my2]
拿破仑的要价, 约为每英亩四美分。

The deal was struck in April 1803, but it brought a good deal of controversy. +
While American development in the 19th century depended on WESTERN EXPANSION, it also raised controversial issues that might lead to the disunion of the United States. +
Some New England Federalists, for example, began to talk of seceding from the U.S. +
since their political power was dramatically reduced by the purchase.

[.my2]
该协议于 1803 年 4 月达成，但引起了很大争议。*尽管美国19世纪的发展依赖于西部扩张，但它也引发了可能导致美国分裂的争议性问题。例如，一些新英格兰联邦党人, 开始谈论脱离美国，因为他们的政治权力, 因购买而急剧下降。*

Further, Jefferson had clearly not followed his own strict interpretation of the Constitution. +
Federalist critics howled that the Constitution nowhere permitted the federal government to purchase new land. +
Jefferson was troubled by the inconsistency, but in the end decided that the Constitution's treaty-making provisions allowed him room to act.

[.my2]
此外，杰斐逊显然没有遵循他自己对宪法的严格解释。联邦党批评者大声疾呼，宪法中没有任何地方允许联邦政府购买新土地。杰斐逊对这种不一致感到困扰，但最终决定宪法的条约制定条款给了他采取行动的空间。

Most of the Senate agreed and the LOUISIANA PURCHASE easily passed 26 to 6. +
The dramatic expansion also contradicted Jefferson's commitment to reduce the national debt as swiftly as possible. +
Although 15 million dollars was a relatively small sum for such a large amount of land, it was still an enormous price tag for the modest federal budget of the day.

[.my2]
参议院大多数人都同意，路易斯安那购买案以 26 比 6 轻松通过。这种戏剧性的扩张也与杰斐逊关于尽快减少国家债务的承诺相矛盾。虽然 1500 万美元对于如此大面积的土地来说是一个相对较小的数字，但对于当时适度的联邦预算来说，这仍然是一个巨大的价格标签。


Thomas Jefferson's purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803 — over 600 million acres at less than 4¢ an acre — was an economic as well as a political victory, as it avoided a possible war with the French.

[.my2]
托马斯·杰斐逊 (Thomas Jefferson) 于 1803 年以每英亩不到 4 美分的价格购买了路易斯安那领土，占地超过 6 亿英亩，这既是经济上的胜利，也是政治上的胜利，因为它避免了与法国可能发生的战争。

The Louisiana Purchase demonstrates Jefferson's ability to make pragmatic political decisions. +
Although contrary to some of his central principles, guaranteeing western expansion was so important to Jefferson's overall vision that he took bold action. +
The gains were dramatic, as the territory acquired would in time add 13 new states to the union. +
In 1812, Louisiana became the first state to join the union from land bought in the purchase. +
Louisiana was allowed to enter the United States with its French legal traditions largely in place. +
Even today, Louisiana's legal code retains many elements that do not follow English common law traditions. +
The federal system could be remarkably flexible.

[.my2]
路易斯安那购买案, 证明了杰斐逊做出务实的政治决策的能力。尽管与他的一些核心原则相反，但保证西部扩张, 对杰斐逊的总体愿景非常重要，因此他采取了大胆的行动。收获是巨大的，因为**所获得的领土, 及时为联邦增添了 13 个新州。 **1812年，**路易斯安那州, 成为第一个通过购买土地加入联邦的州。**路易斯安那州被允许进入美国，**其"法国法律传统"基本被保存了下来。即使在今天，路易斯安那州的法典仍然保留了许多不遵循英国普通法传统的元素。**联邦制度可以非常灵活。

image:/img/008.png[,]


The Louisiana Purchase and rapid western expansion were crucial developments during the early republic. +
But attention there can misleadingly suggest that the United States rapidly assumed the shape we know today. +
Focusing on how the capital city of the federal government changed in the early years of the nation reminds us of the limited nature of the early central government. +
Like so many other elements of the new nation, even the most basic features of the capital city were unsettled. +
President Washington first took office in NEW YORK CITY, but, when reelected in 1792, the capital had already moved to Philadelphia where it would remain for a decade. +
Fittingly, Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in the new and lasting capital of Washington, D.C. +
in March 1801.

[.my2]
**路易斯安那购买, 和快速西部扩张, 是共和国早期的关键发展。**但对那里的关注, 可能会误导人们以为美国很快就形成了我们今天所知道的形状。关注建国初期联邦政府首都的变化，提醒我们早期中央政府的有限性。就像这个新国家的许多其他元素一样，即使是首都最基本的特征也没有得到解决。华盛顿总统首次在纽约市就职，但 1792 年连任时，首都已迁往费城，并在那里停留了十年。由此, 恰当的，杰斐逊于 1801 年 3 月, 就成为第一位在新的永久首都"华盛顿特区"就职的总统。

The site of the new capital was the product of political compromise. +
As part of the struggle over Hamilton's financial poliWashington, D.C哥伦比亚特区cy, Congress supported the Bank of the United States which would be headquartered in Philadelphia. +
In exchange the special DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, to be under Congressional control, would be built on the POTOMAC RIVER. +
The compromise represented a symbolic politics of the very highest order. +
While Hamilton's policies encouraged the consolidation of economic power in the hands of bankers, financiers, and merchants who predominated in the urban northeast, the political capital was to be in a more southerly and agricultural region apart from those economic elites.

[.my2]
**新首都的选址, 是政治妥协的产物。**作为汉密尔顿金融政策斗争的一部分，**国会支持总部设在费城的美国银行。作为交换，将在波托马克河上, 建立受"国会"控制的"哥伦比亚特区"。**这种妥协代表了最高级别的象征性政治。*虽然汉密尔顿的政策, 鼓励将经济权力, 巩固在"东北部城市占主导地位的"银行家、金融家和商人手中，但"政治资本", 却位于远离这些经济精英的更南部的农业地区。*

image:/img/011.png[,]



Today's Washington, D.C., however, is a far cry from the humble place that Jefferson entered in 1801. +
Then just beginning to emerge from a swampy location along the Potomac, the city claimed only 5,000 inhabitants, many of them temporary residents to serve the incoming politicians. +
The Senate building had been completed, but the building for the House of Representatives was still incomplete as was the president's house. +
Jefferson took office while living in a boardinghouse! The limited physical stature of the capital city matched the modest scope of the federal government in the early republic which only included 130 officials. +
In fact, with the exception of the postal service, the national government provided almost no services that reached ordinary people in their everyday lives. +
For most people in the early republic the most meaningful political decisions were made at the state and local level.

[.my2]
然而，今天的华盛顿特区, 与杰斐逊 1801 年进入的那个不起眼的地方相去甚远。当时，这座城市刚开始从波托马克河沿岸的沼泽地中崛起，只有 5,000 名居民，其中许多人是临时居民，为即将到来的新移民提供服务。政治家。参议院大楼已经完工，但"众议院大楼"和"总统府"尚未完工。杰斐逊上任时住在寄宿公寓！首都的物质地位有限，与共和国早期联邦政府规模不大相匹配，仅包括 130 名官员。事实上，除了邮政服务之外，国家政府几乎没有提供任何触及普通百姓日常生活的服务。对于共和国早期的大多数人来说，最有意义的政治决策, 是在州和地方层面做出的。

=== 联邦党人的据点：约翰·马歇尔的最高法院 A Federalist Stronghold: John Marshall's Supreme Court

The Democratic-Republican victory in the 1800 election began a long run of Republican political success. +
In spite of Federalists' departure from most elective offices, they remained a powerful force in American life especially through their leading position among federal judges. +
In the final months of Adams' administration he enlarged the federal judiciary and appointed many new judges.

[.my2]
**"民主共和党"在 1800 年选举中的胜利, 开始了"共和党"政治上的长期成功。尽管"联邦党人"退出了大多数民选职位，但他们仍然是美国生活中的一支强大力量，特别是通过他们在"联邦法官"中的领导地位。**在亚当斯执政的最后几个月，他扩大了"联邦司法机构", 并任命了许多新法官。

In the view of GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, a Federalist senator from New York, this created an independent judiciary necessary "to save the people from their most dangerous enemy, themselves."

[.my2]
在纽约联邦党参议员古维纳尔·莫里斯看来，*这创建了一个必要的独立司法机构，“以将人民从最危险的敌人——他们自己手中(即可能的暴民政治中)拯救出来”。*

In sharp contrast, Democratic-Republicans were appalled by the "MIDNIGHT APPOINTMENTS" that tried to continue Federalist influence despite their election loss. +
In Jefferson's view, the Federalists "retired into the judiciary as a stronghold ... and from that battery all the works of Republicanism are to be beaten down and destroyed."  +
As in so many areas, the two political parties fundamentally disagreed.

[.my2]
与此形成鲜明对比的是，民主共和党人对“午夜任命”感到震惊，*尽管他们(指联邦党)在选举中失利，但仍试图继续"联邦党"的影响力。在杰斐逊看来，联邦党人“退缩到司法部门作为一个据点……* 共和主义的所有工作都将被击垮和摧毁。”正如在许多领域一样，两个政党存在根本分歧。



The most influential of Adams' final judicial appointments in 1801 was naming John Marshall as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. +
He held that position until his death in 1835 and shaped the court's decisions and dramatically raised its stature. +
He also defined the basic relationship of the judiciary to the rest of the federal government. +
His forceful actions as Chief Justice set the Supreme Court on a course it has continued to follow for the next two centuries. +
Marshall was guided by a strong commitment to judicial power and by a belief in the supremacy of national over state legislatures. +
His judicial vision was very much in keeping with the Federalist political program.

[.my2]
1801 年, 亚当斯最终任命的最有影响力的司法任命, 是任命**"约翰·马歇尔"为最"高法院首席大法官"。**他一直担任这一职务, 直至 1835 年去世，**他影响了法院的判决, 并极大地提升了法院的地位。 他还定义了"司法部门"与"联邦政府其他部门"的基本关系。** 作为首席大法官，他采取的有力行动, 使"最高法院"走上了接下来两个世纪继续遵循的道路。马歇尔对司法权力的坚定承诺, 和"国家立法机构至上"的信念为指导。他的司法愿景, 与联邦党的政治纲领非常一致。

John Marshall's earliest landmark decision as Chief Justice came in MARBURY V. +
MADISON (1803) and demonstrates his sophisticated leadership of the Court. +
The issue at stake was the validity of the Federalists' last-minute EXPANSION OF THE JUDICIARY IN 1801, but Marshall used the case to make a much broader statement about the relationship between the distinct branches of the federal government.

[.my2]
*约翰·马歇尔作为首席大法官, 做出的最早具有里程碑意义的裁决, 是在《马伯里诉麦迪逊案》（MARBURY v. +
MADISON）（1803 年）中*，这体现了他对法院的成熟领导。关键问题是, 联邦党人在 1801 年最后一刻扩大司法的有效性，但**马歇尔利用此案, 对联邦政府不同部门之间的关系, 做出了更广泛的声明。**

When James Madison, Jefferson's secretary of state, refused to deliver several commissions for new justices, they petitioned the Supreme Court to compel the executive to act. +
Marshall's written decision on behalf of the unanimous Court found that the petitioners were entitled to their commissions, but refused to take the legal action that they wanted. +
Rather, the court declared that the JUDICIARY ACT OF 1789, which had given the court such power, was inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore invalid.

[.my2]
当杰斐逊的国务卿詹姆斯·麦迪逊, 拒绝向新法官交付几项委任状时，(新法官)他们请求"最高法院"迫使"行政部门"采取行动。马歇尔代表法院一致做出书面决定，认定请愿者有权获得委任，但拒绝采取他们(新法官)想要的法律行动。相反，法院宣布, 赋予法院这种权力的《1789 年司法法》不符合宪法，因此无效。(由此, 最高法院获得了"违宪审查"权)


This was a complex decision. +
In the specific matter before the Court, the decision limited judicial power. +
However, the more fundamental issue that it decided was to insist on the court's authority to declare an act of Congress void if found to be in conflict with the Constitution. +
As Marshall explained, "it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." Since Marbury v. +
Madison the Supreme Court has been the final decision maker regarding the Constitutionality of Congressional legislation.

[.my2]
这是一个复杂的决定。在法院审理的具体事项中，虽然该判决限制了最高法院的司法权。但是，它却决定下了的更加重要的问题，即 -- 如果发现"国会的法案"与"宪法"相冲突，法院有权宣布国会的法案无效。正如马歇尔所解释的那样，“阐明法律是什么，这是司法部门的职权和职责。”自从"马布里诉麦迪逊案"以来，"最高法院"一直是"国会的立法是否符合宪法"的最终决策者。

The MARSHALL COURT, and this decision in particular, established the principle of "judicial review" whereby Congressional laws and executive actions may be judged by the Supreme Court to be within the bounds of the Constitution. +
In keeping with John Marshall's Federalist views, he generally favored strong government action and especially supported the supremacy of the federal government over state authorities.

[.my2]
马歇尔法院，特别是这一判决，确立了“司法审查”原则，最高法院可以据此, 来判定"国会法律"和"行政行为"是否符合宪法。与约翰·马歇尔的联邦党人观点一致，他总体上赞成采取强有力的政府行动，特别支持联邦政府, 凌驾于州当局之上。

===== John Adams  约翰·亚当斯 (第二任美国总统, 1797-1801年)

法国大革命后英法开战，*汉密尔顿与"联邦党人"认为, 法国大革命无论在政治还是反宗教领域都太激进，主张支持英国王室；而杰斐逊与"民主共和党"则反对英王，极力支持法国*。*亚当斯上台后, 决定延续华盛顿总统政策, 不卷入战争*.

但《杰伊条约》导致法国把美国视为英国的小老弟，开始扣押与英国交易的美国商船。*看在革命战争时期援助的份儿上，大部分美国人还对法国心存亲切，许多人把《杰伊条约》视为国耻，渴望支持共和国对抗英国君主，无法接受与法开战。*

亚当斯1797年5月16日向国会两院演讲，呼吁加强国防, 以防与法开战. +
但"民主共和党人"却对总统出离愤怒, 因为他不但未表态支持法兰西共和国革命事业，甚至还主张对法开战。

亚当斯任命约翰·马歇尔等人, 与法国外长谈判, 但法国外长的三名代理人 X、Y、Z, 要求美方支付巨额贿赂, 才愿谈判. +
其中有些钱是付给法国外长本人，有些付给法兰西共和国，借口是对"亚当斯国会演讲冒犯法国"的补偿. +
美方拒绝. +
XYZ事件无疑大幅削弱了美国民众支持法国的民意。

XYZ事件不足以扭转"民主共和党人"反对亚当斯的立场。**"联邦党"指控法国及其侨民挑起内乱，为平息动乱, 提出连串法案并经国会通过，亚当斯1798年6月签署，史称《客籍法和镇压叛乱法》。** 国会短短两周就通过《归化法》、《外国友人法》、《敌侨法》、《惩治叛乱法》.

政府根据《惩治叛乱法》, 提出至少14条诉状，六家最有名的"民主共和党"报纸中, 有五家被告上法庭。但部分史家认为《客籍法和惩治叛乱法》很少执行.

对此, *"民主共和党人"杰斐逊撰写的《肯塔基决议案》, 主张各州拥有废止任何违宪法案的“自然权利”，麦迪逊起草的《弗吉尼来决议案》, 宣称各州可能不得不以最后手段, “与我们无比珍视的联邦分离”。* (美国联邦可能有分裂的危险)

===== 马伯利诉麦迪逊案 Marbury v. +
Madison -- 另最高法院, 获得"违宪审查"权力. +
由此最终为美国确立了"三权分立"的实质

是美国最高法院于1803年判决的一个案例。庄园主马伯利由于上届政府的疏忽，而未收到“太平绅士”的委任状，而继任政府的国务卿麦迪逊, 拒绝承认"委任"的合法性及将委任状下发。*根据1789年美国国会通过的《司法法》第13条，"最高法院"对此具有初审管辖权，于是马伯利直接向当时并无实权的最高法院提起诉讼，要求得到自己的委任状。*

*在由首席大法官约翰·马歇尔主笔的判决意见中，裁定马伯利不应该获得委任状，但同时首次运用"司法审查权"，判定1789年美国国会通过的《司法法》因为违宪而无效，理由是根据美国宪法第三条第二项第二款，最高法院对此案并不具有"初审管辖权"，而仅具有"上诉管辖权"，故将案件撤销。*

*虽然马伯利未得到委任状，但美国"最高法院"得以在避免与"行政权"正面冲突的基础上，树立了对宪法的解释权，即"司法审查权" (马歇尔是利用了这个案子, 虽然没有帮打官司者实现目标, 但借这个案子实现了马歇尔自己的目标)。由此开始，"司法权"成为制衡"行政权"和"立法权"的第三种权力，确立了美国"三权分立"的宪政体制。*

背景:
1801年2月4日，约翰·马歇尔宣誓就职最高法院首席大法官，*当时宪法也未将最高法院的权限定义清楚，所以对于最高法院的作用，人们有不同认识，并引发各种分歧和争论。许多人认为最高法院的作用最多只能解释法律而不能推翻法律。* 最高法院1790年-1800年的最初十年中只审理了100多起案件，而且多为涉及海事、财产和商务的非宪法案件。**不过乔治·华盛顿对最高法院的大法官们寄予厚望，在给大法官的信中, 他相信“联邦政府的稳定与成功”很大程度上有赖于“其法律的解释和执行”。所以，他认为“重要的是，司法制度不仅应该行动独立，**而且，其组织构成也应该尽可能完美”。他希望大法官能够坦率地告诉他所遇到的各种问题，这样，他和立法部门, 就可以进行改正。

*尽管有华盛顿的支持，最高法院的大法官, 还是要在每年的春秋季各3个月的时间中，在各自的巡回区内奔波审案。*

其次，美国宪法第六条中虽然确立了《美利坚合众国"宪法"》的最高法地位，但**美国宪法中却留下了一个重大遗憾：它没有规定由哪个机关来进行"违宪审查"。** 原因在于制宪者对于这一问题无法进行妥协，这导致, 无论制宪者是出于有意还是无意，这一问题只能留待后人去解决。

*1800年美国总统选举中，在任总统"约翰·亚当斯"的"联邦党"遭遇失败，在同时举行的"国会"选举中，联邦党也失去多数。在其任期的最后阶段，亚当斯利用手中的总统权力, 及其由联邦党人所控制的"国会"，对"司法部门"作了重大调整，并且迅速委任了大批的"联邦党人"出任"联邦法官"。*

正好在1800年12月，美国最高法院首席大法官"埃尔沃思"辞职，亚当斯即提名时任国务卿的"马歇尔"继任为最高法院首席大法官，这一提名立即获得"国会"批准。

与此同时，联邦党人国会1801年2月13日通过《司法法》, 将联邦巡回法院由3个增加到6个，增加了16个联邦巡回法官；两个星期后又通过了《哥伦比亚特区组织法》，成立了特区法院. +
在1801年3月3日，由当天卸任的亚当斯总统连夜任命42位“太平绅士” (临下台前, 突袭来给民主党埋地雷)，后人将这些法官戏称为“午夜法官”（midnight judges）。这些做法，尤其是这两部法律激怒了杰斐逊。

*根据上述两项新的法律，即将卸任的亚当斯总统一共任命了50多名法官，全部都是右翼联邦党人。本案原告威廉·马伯利（William Marbury）——一位来自马里兰州的银行家兼庄园主，也成为“午夜法官”之一。*"参议院"批准了这些任命。即将卸任的总统也签署的委任状，接下来的工作应由国务卿——同时也是正式就任首席大法官的马歇尔，在委任状上加盖美利坚合众国的国玺，然后发出。马歇尔于1801年3月3日抓紧送发委任状，但是由于最后时刻工作过多，有17份委任状未在马歇尔卸任国务卿之前发出。*1801年3月4日，托马斯·杰斐逊就任总统，并任命"詹姆斯·麦迪逊"为国务卿。他得知此事后，对亚当斯卸任前的这些做法十分恼火，决心采取措施纠正，指令其国务卿"詹姆斯·麦迪逊"不得发出这些委任状。*

1801年12月，马伯利和另外四名没有收到委任状的法官一起，直接向最高法院一审起诉詹姆斯·麦迪逊，要求最高法院颁布执行令，指令麦迪逊将委任状投递给他们。依据是国会于1789年颁布的《司法法》第13条规定，针对联邦官员提出执行令的案件，最高法院具有初审管辖权。

马歇尔的选择 +
**这似乎只是一个"最高法院"能否向"国务卿"下达执行令的问题。**从表面上看, 最高法院有两种选择:

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |这意味着

|→ *否认"最高法院"拥有针对"行政机关"下达执行令的权力*，并驳回马伯利的申请.
|*如果作此选择，将意味着放弃宪法赋予最高法院"司法权"的实质.*

|→ *命令麦迪逊发给马伯利委任状，这样可以宣称"最高法院"具有约束"行政机关"遵守法律的权力*.
|但这只是“纸面的宣告”，因为最高法院并不具有执行自己命令的权力，可以预见杰斐逊和麦迪逊将拒绝发出委任状。
|===

**无论"最高法院"采用这两种选择中的哪种，都将使其地位下降到"行政机关"和"国会"以下的次等位置 (也就是说, 如果你直接放弃你的权力, 那你自然降格; 但如果你去命令, 但指挥不动别人, 你也等于降格了)。**所以实质上最高法院此时面临的是自身法律地位的问题，**宪法赋予"最高法院"与"行政权"、"立法权"同等的权力，但是否能够得以确立？又以何种方式正式确立？**问题放在马歇尔法官面前。


马歇尔对于政治事务与法律问题同样内行，*他找出《司法法》与宪法的矛盾点，并聚焦于此：*

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|美国宪法 →
|美国宪法第三条第二款第二项是这样写的：“涉及大使、其他使节和领事, 以及一州为一方当事人的一切案件，其'初审权'属于最高法院。对上述的所有其他案件，无论是法律方面还是事实方面，最高法院有'上诉审理权'，但须遵照国会所规定的例外和规则。”

可见，根据宪法的这一规定，联邦最高法院的一审案件管辖权只限于两类：

- 以大使、其他使节和领事为一方当事人的一切案件；
- 一州为一方当事人的一切案件。

|司法法 →
|1789年《司法法》第13条是这样写的：“在法律原则和习惯所容许的范围内，美国最高法院, 有权向联邦政府现职官员下达执行令，命其履行其法定义务。”  +
*可见, 1789年《司法法》第13条所规定的联邦最高法院管辖的一审案件, 有三类: 即除了宪法中规定的两类外，还包括在联邦行政部门不履行法定职责时，当事人向联邦"最高法院"起诉, 请求向联邦"行政部门"发布强制执行令的案件。*

由此可知，1789年**《司法法》第13条, 扩大了宪法赋予联邦"最高法院"的一审案件的管辖权，这就涉及1789年《司法法》第13条扩大的部分, 是否有宪法依据、是否违反了宪法的问题。**
|===


而马伯利恰恰是依据1789年《司法法》第13条中, 扩大了宪法规定的联邦最高法院一审案件管辖权的规定, 向联邦最高法院提起的诉讼。马歇尔选择了运用"司法审查权"，裁定1789年《司法法》的第13条违宪。这样马歇尔就使自己摆脱了两难境地，理由是宪法赋予"最高法院"的"一审"案件管辖权, 是排他性的，不能通过"国会的法律"加以扩大。所以最高法院否决马伯利的申请, 并不是因为"行政机关"高于"司法法的法律"，而是因为马伯利直接要求最高法院颁布执行令，而最高法院本身并不具有此案的一审案件管辖权。



约翰·马歇尔1808年
1803年2月24日，马歇尔宣布了由他自己撰写的最高法院判决意见，他首先提出了三个问题：[16]

问题[编辑]
“申诉人是否有权取得他所要求的委任状？”[17]
“如果他有权，而这种权利已受到侵犯，他所在州的法律是否向他提供补救办法？”[18]
“如果法律确实向他提供补救办法，是否即为本院发出的执行令？”[18]
答案[编辑]
马歇尔在判决意见中接下来作出了这样回答：

对于第一个问题，马歇尔是这样回答的：“合众国总统通过签署马伯利先生的委任状，任命他为哥伦比亚特区华盛顿县的一名太平绅士，国务卿盖在委任状上的合众国国玺是总统签名正式有效及委任业已完成的确证；委任状授予他担任此项职位五年的合法权利。”[18]
对于前述第二个问题，马歇尔的回答也是肯定的。他说“每个人受到侵害时，都有权要求法律保护。合众国政府被宣称为法治政府，而非人治政府，如果它的法律不能对于合法权利进行保护与补偿的话，那么就不配享有这个荣誉。”[16]“太平绅士作为司法系统中的一员，并不像各部部长一样从属于总统的酌情权。所以总统于该案中的作为必须要经受司法审查。”[来源请求]也就是说，国务卿麦迪逊不得剥夺马伯利既得的权利，帮助马伯利从麦迪逊处得到委任状是法院的责任。[13]
对于第三个问题，马歇尔笔锋一转，给出一个否定的回答。马歇尔认为虽然法院有权向行政官员发出执行令，但在马伯利案中，最高法院仅具有“上诉管辖权”，而不具有“初审管辖权”；简单地说，就是马伯利告错了地方。[13]
结论[编辑]
马歇尔的根据是如前所述的宪法第三条第二款第二项；而马伯利在最高法院起诉，是参考了如上所述的1789年《司法法》第13条，于是马歇尔斩钉截铁的指出，《司法法》这一条与宪法冲突，非法扩大了最高法院的权限。[13] 在马歇尔的判决意见中，有一部分是这样写的：“宪法要么是一项用普通方法不可改变的最高法，要么就是与普通法处于同等地位，并且像其他立法一样，立法机关想要改变就可以改变。倘若前一种选择是正确的，那么违反宪法的立法就不成其为法律；倘若后一种选择是正确的，那么成文宪法就是人民想要限制一项其本身性质是无限权力的荒谬企图。”[19]马歇尔强调，“宪法构成国家的根本法和最高法律”，“违反宪法的法律是无效的”，“解释法律显然是司法部门的权限范围和责任”。[13]马歇尔在判决意见中运用三段论推断出法院有审查法律是否违反宪法的职责：

大前提：宪法是最高法，具有最高的法效力；
小前提：法官在就职时宣誓忠于宪法；
结论：法官有维护宪法、判断法律是否违反宪法的职责。
由于法院拥有违宪审查权是由这一三段论推导出来的，而不是宪法上的明确规定，因而马歇尔在判决中说，法院的这一权力虽不是宪法上明确规定的，但它是宪法上“默示”的。据此，马歇尔得出结论，宪法的含义否定了最高法院拥有原诉管辖权；尽管1789年《司法法》赋予了最高法院原诉和上诉管辖权，但因违宪而无效，本案撤销。

分析[编辑]
为了做出这一判决，并裁定国会的法律无效，最高法院宣布自己有权审查国会法律的合宪性。这是一个绝无仅有的时机，因为最高法院并未支持马伯利的申请，所以不会引发与杰斐逊的正面冲突。并且，作为司法权中的最强大的权力——司法审查权，是在裁定国会赋予最高法院额外管辖权的法律违宪，这样一个环境中得到声明的；这使得杰斐逊很难对此进行攻击；而且马伯利案正处于美国建国之初的1803年，倘若马歇尔这时不采取此一立场，最高法院第二次使用司法审查权是时隔54年后的斯科特诉桑福德案，到那时再提出以司法审查权来推翻国会法律，可能就很难得到认可。[15]不过，后世有学者认为该论定并非无懈可击，因为1789年《司法法》原文可有多种合理的解释。[来源请求]马歇尔在本案中关于最高法院具有司法审查权的说法，并非首创。该学说起源于殖民时代和独立战争时期；在宪法成文时，对政府权力的限制措施，使得学说成为法律的一条固有原则；而马歇尔在马伯利案的判决意见中，则是把以前宣告过的内容以明确的形式确立下来。进一步说，马歇尔的判决意见之所以重要，是因为美国最高裁判机构以判决的形式阐述了自身具有司法审查权这样一个事实。[20]司法机关和法官以法为依据进行判案，而当法律与宪法相抵触时，当然要适用法效力更高的宪法，不能适用法效力低而与宪法相抵触的法律。

影响[编辑]

刻在美国最高法院墙壁上的判语
由于马伯利案是确立最高法院审查合宪性的第一案，所以该案对后世有深远影响，此案例后来被数百次的引用，成为被引用次数最多的案例。[21]美国首席大法官马歇尔在这个案件中写下的著名的一句判语，现在被刻在美国最高法院的墙壁上：
“解释法律显然是司法部门的权限范围和责任。”

[13]

今天，几乎所有的宪法课程，一开始都会提到马伯利诉麦迪逊案，世界各国的立宪民主政体，都把这个案例奉为制衡之源。[22]

批判[编辑]
从理论上对马歇尔的判决提出有力批判的要数约翰·B·吉布森法官。他在宾夕法尼亚州最高法院审理埃金诉劳布案中，对马歇尔的判决提出了以下批驳：

司法机关的正常的和主要的权力并未扩展到取消立法机关所制定的法令；
凡适用于具有平等地位其他部门之一的东西，也应适用于政府的其他部门。司法机关有权解释宪法，那么立法机关至少有同样的宪法解释权。不解释宪法怎么可能依据宪法的精神制定具体的法律呢？
相互制约的概念本身并不包含司法否决权的思想；
他用另一个三段论来反驳马歇尔的三段论：
大前提：宪法是最高法，具有最高的法效力；
小前提：总统在就职时宣誓忠于宪法；
结论：总统有维护宪法、审查法律是否违反宪法的权力。
在美国宪法上，联邦的行政权属总统一个人，行政权实行总统高度集权制。因此，由总统来行使违宪审查权是不可思议的。由此得出结论来说，法院的违宪审查权并不是宪法上默示的权力，而是马歇尔从宪法那里“偷”来的权力。[23]

=== 1790 年代的公共冲突

The French Revolution. The emergence of the two-party system. Threats of war with France and England. The first transfer of Presidential political power. George Washington called "debauched" and worse. The clampdown of personal freedoms. Welcome to the political 1790s in America.

The extraordinary conflict that divided American life in the 1790s centered on divergent understandings of the meaning of the American Revolution and how its legacy should be nurtured in the new nation. Arguments about that fundamental question probably would have been controversial under any circumstances, but were dramatically heightened by the explosive example of the French Revolution. The United States was still a fragile experiment in republican government. Its domestic events and attitudes would greatly be shaped by events in Europe.


The deep conflict of the 1790s stimulated a profound new development in American politics. During the Revolution patriots had expected, and even demanded, that all virtuous people support them in a cause they saw as the only real force for the public good. Even into the 1790s, most Americans believed that there could be only one legitimate position to take on political issues. This helps to explain the rabid opinions of the period that were set before the public by a remarkable growth in newspapers during the decade. These newspapers did not pretend to be objective in how they reported events. Instead, newspapers sold issues because of their intense commitment to a particular partisan view of the contentious events of the day.

Consider these diametrically opposed opinions about President Washington. A Federalist newspaper trumpeted, "Many a private person might make a great President; but will there ever be a President who will make so great a man as Washington?" Meanwhile, a Democratic-Republican paper condemned that same hero. "If ever a nation was debauched by a man, the American nation has been debauched by Washington. . . . Let the history of the federal government instruct mankind, that the mask of patriotism may be worn to conceal the foulest designs against the liberties of the people." As this newspaper suggests, most people believed that their political enemies would destroy the nation if allowed to hold power.

It was JOHN ADAMS' misfortune to be elected president in these deeply divided times. A genuine patriot and man of deep principle, domestic and international controversies placed nearly impossible challenges before the second president. If even Washington suffered harsh public attack from opposition newspapers, imagine what they were prepared to say about the less imposing John Adams.


By 1798 Adams and the FEDERALIST CONGRESS passed a series of laws that severely limited American civil liberties. Acting upon their judgment that political critics were treasonous opponents of good government, Adams followed the lead of Congressional leaders and heightened domestic repression. Adams supported policies that have subsequently been widely viewed as unconstitutional. Nevertheless, he was a moderating influence in his own party and refused to use the threat of war as a tool to exploit patriotic fervor to his own advantage. The gulf that separates our political attitudes from those of Adams and his Federalist colleagues in the late 1790s reveals the fundamental transformation of American political thought during that decade.

=== Trans-Atlantic Crisis: The French Revolution


The French Revolution brought fundamental changes to the feudal order of monarchical and aristocratic privilege.

Americans widely celebrated the French Revolution in its glorious opening in 1789, as it struck at the very heart of ABSOLUTIST POWER.

France seemed to be following the American republican example by creating a constitutional monarchy where traditional elites would be restrained by written law.

Where the king had previously held absolute power, now he would have to act within clear legal boundaries.



The FRENCH REVOLUTION soon moved beyond this already considerable assault on the traditional order.

Largely pushed forward by a crisis brought on by a war that began in 1792 against Prussia and Austria, the French Revolution took a dramatic turn that climaxed with the beheading of KING LOUIS XVI and the abandonment of Christianity in favor of a new state religion based on reason.

The French Revolution became far more radical than the American Revolution. In addition to a period of extreme public violence, which became known as the REIGN OF TERROR, the French Revolution also attempted to enhance the rights and power of poor people and women.

In fact, it even went so far as to outlaw slavery in the FRENCH COLONIES of the Caribbean.



The profound changes set in motion by the French Revolution had an enormous impact in France as well as through the large scale European war it sparked from 1792 to 1815.

It also helped to transform American politics starting in the mid-1790s. While the French Revolution had initially received broad support in the United States, its radicalization in 1792-1793 led to sharp disagreement in American opinion.




Domestic attitudes toward the proper future of the American republic grew even more intense as a result of the example of revolutionary France.

Conservatives like Hamilton, Washington, and others who would soon organize as the Federalist political party saw the French Revolution as an example of homicidal anarchy.

When Great Britain joined European allies in the war against France in 1793, Federalists supported this action as an attempt to enforce proper order.


The opposing American view, held by men like Jefferson and others who came to organize as the Democratic-Republican political party, supported French actions as an extension of a world-wide republican struggle against corrupt monarchy and aristocratic privilege.


The example of the French Revolution helped convince Americans on both sides that their political opponents were motivated by dangerous and even evil forces that threatened to destroy the young republic.




The United States was a small new country. Regardless, it found itself in the midst of the dramatic escalation of political and military conflicts brought on by the French Revolution.

President Washington declared American neutrality in the war, breaking the terms of a 1778 treaty with France that had promised mutual assistance between the two countries. While France had aided the U.S. during the American Revolution, America would not do the same for France.

Washington's decision stemmed from his philosophical commitment to non-involvement in foreign affairs, but was also based upon pragmatic considerations. Ninety percent of all U.S. imports came from Britain and customs duties on these imports produced ninety percent of federal revenues.

The conflict in Europe created an immense opportunity for Americans. Farmers, merchants, and ship owners all stood to profit from the long European war and even American manufacturers were shielded from massive cheap imports from the Old World. The war stimulated a broad recovery of the American economy.

In the face of American neutrality that would continue a strong economic relationship with Great Britain, the French government sent EDMOND GENET to the U.S. as a diplomatic envoy. Controversially, Genet was instructed to enlist American aid for the French Revolution even though Washington had established a clear policy of neutrality.

The American republic was caught between the two great superpowers of the day.

===  Two Parties Emerge


The ELECTION OF 1796 was the first election in American history where political CANDIDATES at the local, state, and national level began to run for OFFICE as members of organized political parties that held strongly opposed political principles.

This was a stunning new phenomenon that shocked most of the older leaders of the Revolutionary Era. Even Madison, who was one of the earliest to see the value of political parties, believed that they would only serve as temporary coalitions for specific controversial elections. The older leaders failed to understand the dynamic new conditions that had been created by the importance of popular sovereignty — democracy — to the American Revolution. The people now understood themselves as a fundamental force in legitimating government authority. In the modern American political system, voters mainly express themselves through allegiances within a competitive party system. 1796 was the first election where this defining element of modern political life began to appear.

The two parties adopted names that reflected their most cherished values. The Federalists of 1796 attached themselves to the successful campaign in favor of the Constitution and were solid supporters of the federal administration. Although Washington denounced parties as a horrid threat to the republic, his vice president John Adams became the de facto presidential candidate of the Federalists. The party had its strongest support among those who favored Hamilton's policies. Merchants, creditors and urban artisans who built the growing commercial economy of the northeast provided its most dedicated supporters and strongest regional support.



The opposition party adopted the name DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICANS, which suggested that they were more fully committed to extending the Revolution to ordinary people. The supporters of the Democratic-Republicans (often referred to as the Republicans) were drawn from many segments of American society and included farmers throughout the country with high popularity among German and Scots-Irish ethnic groups. Although it effectively reached ordinary citizens, its key leaders were wealthy southern tobacco elites like Jefferson and Madison. While the Democratic-Republicans were more diverse, the Federalists were wealthier and carried more prestige, especially by association with the retired Washington.

The 1796 election was waged with uncommon intensity. Federalists thought of themselves as the "friends of order" and good government. They viewed their opponents as dangerous radicals who would bring the anarchy of the French Revolution to America.

The Democratic-Republicans despised Federalist policies. According to one Republican-minded New York newspaper, the Federalists were "aristocrats, endeavoring to lay the foundations of monarchical government, and Republicans [were] the real supporters of independence, friends to equal rights, and warm advocates of free elective government."


A sure sign of the great novelty of political parties was that the Constitution had established that the runner-up in the presidential election would become the vice president.

John Adams took office after a harsh campaign and narrow victory. His political opponent Jefferson served as second in command.

=== The Adams Presidency

The Adams administration faced several severe tests. It was a mixed administration. Adams was a Federalist. Jefferson, the vice-president, was a Democratic-Republican. Federalists were increasingly divided between CONSERVATIVES such as Hamilton and MODERATES such as Adams who still saw himself as above party politics.

Beyond these considerable problems in his own party, Adams also faced a major international crisis. The French were outraged by what they viewed as an ANGLO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE in Jay's Treaty.

The strong steps that Adams took in response to the French foreign threat also included severe repression of domestic protest. A series of laws known collectively as the ALIEN AND SEDITION ACTS were passed by the Federalist Congress in 1798 and signed into law by President Adams. These laws included new powers to DEPORT foreigners as well as making it harder for new IMMIGRANTS to vote. Previously a new immigrant would have to reside in the United States for five years before becoming eligible to vote, but a new law raised this to 14 years.



Clearly, the Federalists saw foreigners as a deep threat to American security. As one Federalist in Congress declared, there was no need to "invite hordes of Wild Irishmen, nor the turbulent and disorderly of all the world, to come here with a basic view to distract our tranquillity." Not coincidentally, non-English ethnic groups had been among the core supporters of the Democratic-Republicans in 1796.

The most controversial of the new laws permitting strong government control over individual actions was the SEDITION ACT. In essence, this Act prohibited public opposition to the government. Fines and imprisonment could be used against those who "write, print, utter, or publish . . . any false, scandalous and malicious writing" against the government.

Under the terms of this law over 20 Democratic-Republican newspaper editors were arrested and some were imprisoned.



The Sedition Act clearly violated individual protections under the first amendment of the Constitution; however, the practice of "JUDICIAL REVIEW," whereby the Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of laws was not yet well developed. Furthermore, the justices were all strong Federalists. As a result, Madison and Jefferson directed their opposition to the new laws to state legislatures. The Virginia and Kentucky legislatures passed resolutions declaring the federal laws invalid within their states. The bold challenge to the federal government offered by this strong states' rights position seemed to point toward imminent armed conflict within the United States.


Enormous changes had occurred in the explosive decade of the 1790s. Federalists in government now viewed the persistence of their party as the equivalent of the survival of the republic. This led them to enact and enforce harsh laws. Madison, who had been the chief architect of a strong central government in the Constitution, now was wary of national authority. He actually helped the KENTUCKY LEGISLATURE to reject federal law. By placing states rights above those of the federal government, Kentucky and Virginia had established a precedent that would be used to justify the secession of southern states in the Civil War.



The ELECTION OF 1800 between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson was an emotional and hard-fought campaign. Each side believed that victory by the other would ruin the nation.

Federalists attacked Jefferson as an un-Christian deist whose sympathy for the French Revolution would bring similar bloodshed and chaos to the United States. On the other side, the Democratic-Republicans denounced the strong centralization of federal power under Adams's presidency. Republicans' specifically objected to the expansion of the U.S. army and navy, the attack on individual rights in the Alien and Sedition Acts, and new taxes and deficit spending used to support broadened federal action.

Overall, the Federalists wanted strong federal authority to restrain the excesses of popular majorities, while the Democratic-Republicans wanted to reduce national authority so that the people could rule more directly through state governments.


As the first peaceful transition of political power between opposing parties in U.S. history, however, the election of 1800 had far-reaching significance.




John Adams stands as an almost tragic figure.

Rather than continue to use the exigencies of war to build his own popularity and to justify the need for strong federal authority, Adams opened negotiations with France when the opportunity arose to work toward peace. Reconciling with France during the critical campaign of 1800 enraged many Federalists.

Hamilton, ever the shrewd political operator, denounced Adams' actions, for a quasi-war clearly could stimulate patriotic fervor. This might help Federalists win the upcoming election. In the end, Adams only convinced the Federalist Congress to move toward peace by threatening to resign and thus allow Jefferson to become president! Vilified by his political opponents and abandoned by conservatives in his own party, Adams would be the only one-tern president in the early national period until his son suffered the same fate in the election of 1828.

Adams emphasized the limits of human nature. Unlike the more optimistic Jefferson, Adams stressed that human reason could not overcome all the world's problems.

=== Jeffersonian America: A Second Revolution?

The harsh public antagonism of the 1790s largely came to an end with the victory of the Democratic- Republicans in the 1800 election.

To Jefferson and his supporters, the defeat of the Federalists ended their attempt to lead America on a more conservative and less democratic course. Since the Federalists never again played a national political role after the defeat in 1800, it seems that most American voters of the era shared Jefferson's view.



Jefferson's election inaugurated a "VIRGINIA DYNASTY" that held the presidency from 1801 to 1825. After Jefferson's two terms as president, he was followed by two other two-term Democratic-Republicans from Virginia, James Madison and James Monroe.

The CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT throughout the JEFFERSONIAN ERA, JOHN MARSHALL, was an ardent Federalist. Even while his political opponents controlled elected national office, Marshall consistently supported the supremacy of national power over the states. He led the court in establishing legal precedents to support this view.

JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA is a term that helps us enter the contested and deeply contradictory nature of the United States at the start of the 19th century. Grappling fully with its meaning requires the use of sophisticated analytical skills that assess both its strengths and its weaknesses. To merely celebrate or condemn, seeing one side, but not the other, is to judge without attempting to understand.

Seeing how the best and the worst of Jeffersonian America were deeply intermixed, and continue to inform American life in our transformed circumstances of the 21st century, is among the most important purposes of historical inquiry.


Jefferson's most fundamental political belief was an "absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the MAJORITY." Stemming from his deep optimism in human reason, Jefferson believed that the WILL OF THE PEOPLE, expressed through elections, provided the most appropriate guidance for directing the republic's course.


Jefferson also felt that the central government should be "rigorously frugal and simple." As president he reduced the size and scope of the federal government by ending internal taxes, reducing the size of the army and navy, and paying off the government's debt. Limiting the federal government flowed from his strict interpretation of the Constitution.

Finally, Jefferson also committed his presidency to the protection of civil liberties and minority rights. As he explained in his INAUGURAL ADDRESS IN 1801, "though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, and to violate would be oppression." Jefferson's experience of Federalist repression in the late 1790s led him to more clearly define a central concept of American democracy.


His crucial sense of what mattered most in life grew from a deep appreciation of farming, in his mind the most virtuous and meaningful human activity.

he saw two dangerous threats to his ideal AGRARIAN DEMOCRACY. To him, financial speculation and the development of urban industry both threatened to rob men of the independence that they maintained as farmers. Debt, on the one hand, and factory work, on the other, could rob men of the economic autonomy essential for republican citizens.

Jefferson's vision was not anti-modern, for he had too brilliant a scientific mind to fear technological change. He supported INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE to benefit farmers and wanted to see new TECHNOLOGY widely incorporated into ordinary farms and households to make them more productive.


Jefferson pinpointed a deeply troubling problem. How could REPUBLICAN LIBERTY and DEMOCRATIC EQUALITY be reconciled with social changes that threatened to increase inequality? The awful working conditions in early industrial England loomed as a terrifying example. For Jefferson, western expansion provided an escape from the British model. As long as hard working farmers could acquire land at reasonable prices, then America could prosper as a republic of equal and independent citizens. Jefferson's ideas helped to inspire a mass political movement that achieved many key aspects of his plan.

In spite of the success and importance of Jeffersonian Democracy, dark flaws limited even Jefferson's grand vision. First, his hopes for the incorporation of technology at the household level failed to grasp how poverty often pushed women and children to the forefront of the new industrial labor. Second, an equal place for Native Americans could not be accommodated within his plans for an agrarian republic. Third, Jefferson's celebration of agriculture disturbingly ignored the fact that slaves worked the richest farm land in the United States. Slavery was obviously incompatible with true democratic values. Jefferson's explanation of slaves within the republic argued that African Americans' racial inferiority barred them from becoming full and equal citizens.



Our final assessment of Jeffersonian Democracy rests on a profound contradiction. Jefferson was the single most powerful individual leading the struggle to enhance the rights of ordinary people in the early republic. Furthermore, his Declaration of Independence had eloquently expressed America's statement of purpose "that all men are created equal." Still, he owned slaves all his life and, unlike Washington, never set them free.

For all his greatness, Jefferson did not transcend the pervasive racism of his day.


Jefferson's plans for the nation depended upon western expansion and access to international markets for American farm products. This vision was threatened, however, when France regained control of Louisiana. NAPOLEON, who had now risen to power in the French Revolution, threatened to block American access to the important port of New Orleans on the Mississippi River. New American settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains depended upon river transport to get their goods to market since overland trade to the east was expensive and impractical.



Blocking American access to New Orleans was such a grave threat to American interests that President Jefferson considered changing his traditional foreign policy stance to an anti-French alliance with the British. At the same time that he sent diplomats to France to bargain for continued trade access along the Mississippi, he also sent diplomats to Britain to pursue other policy options. James Monroe, the top person negotiating in Paris, was empowered to purchase New Orleans and West Florida for between two and ten million dollars.


Surprisingly, however, Napoleon offered much more. He was militarily overextended and needing money to continue his war against Britain. Knowing full well that he could not force Americans out of the land France possessed in North America, Napoleon offered all of LOUISIANA to the U.S. for 15 million dollars. The massive territory stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and more than doubled the size of the United States.


Napoleon's asking price worked out to be about four cents an acre.

The deal was struck in April 1803, but it brought a good deal of controversy. While American development in the 19th century depended on WESTERN EXPANSION, it also raised controversial issues that might lead to the disunion of the United States. Some New England Federalists, for example, began to talk of seceding from the U.S. since their political power was dramatically reduced by the purchase.

Further, Jefferson had clearly not followed his own strict interpretation of the Constitution. Federalist critics howled that the Constitution nowhere permitted the federal government to purchase new land. Jefferson was troubled by the inconsistency, but in the end decided that the Constitution's treaty-making provisions allowed him room to act.

Most of the Senate agreed and the LOUISIANA PURCHASE easily passed 26 to 6. The dramatic expansion also contradicted Jefferson's commitment to reduce the national debt as swiftly as possible. Although 15 million dollars was a relatively small sum for such a large amount of land, it was still an enormous price tag for the modest federal budget of the day.


Thomas Jefferson's purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803 — over 600 million acres at less than 4¢ an acre — was an economic as well as a political victory, as it avoided a possible war with the French.

The Louisiana Purchase demonstrates Jefferson's ability to make pragmatic political decisions. Although contrary to some of his central principles, guaranteeing western expansion was so important to Jefferson's overall vision that he took bold action. The gains were dramatic, as the territory acquired would in time add 13 new states to the union. In 1812, Louisiana became the first state to join the union from land bought in the purchase. Louisiana was allowed to enter the United States with its French legal traditions largely in place. Even today, Louisiana's legal code retains many elements that do not follow English common law traditions. The federal system could be remarkably flexible.


The Louisiana Purchase and rapid western expansion were crucial developments during the early republic. But attention there can misleadingly suggest that the United States rapidly assumed the shape we know today. Focusing on how the capital city of the federal government changed in the early years of the nation reminds us of the limited nature of the early central government. Like so many other elements of the new nation, even the most basic features of the capital city were unsettled. President Washington first took office in NEW YORK CITY, but, when reelected in 1792, the capital had already moved to Philadelphia where it would remain for a decade. Fittingly, Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in the new and lasting capital of Washington, D.C. in March 1801.


The site of the new capital was the product of political compromise. As part of the struggle over Hamilton's financial poliWashington, D.C哥伦比亚特区cy, Congress supported the Bank of the United States which would be headquartered in Philadelphia. In exchange the special DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, to be under Congressional control, would be built on the POTOMAC RIVER. The compromise represented a symbolic politics of the very highest order. While Hamilton's policies encouraged the consolidation of economic power in the hands of bankers, financiers, and merchants who predominated in the urban northeast, the political capital was to be in a more southerly and agricultural region apart from those economic elites.




Today's Washington, D.C., however, is a far cry from the humble place that Jefferson entered in 1801. Then just beginning to emerge from a swampy location along the Potomac, the city claimed only 5,000 inhabitants, many of them temporary residents to serve the incoming politicians. The Senate building had been completed, but the building for the House of Representatives was still incomplete as was the president's house. Jefferson took office while living in a boardinghouse! The limited physical stature of the capital city matched the modest scope of the federal government in the early republic which only included 130 officials. In fact, with the exception of the postal service, the national government provided almost no services that reached ordinary people in their everyday lives. For most people in the early republic the most meaningful political decisions were made at the state and local level.

===  A Federalist Stronghold: John Marshall's Supreme Court

The Democratic-Republican victory in the 1800 election began a long run of Republican political success. In spite of Federalists' departure from most elective offices, they remained a powerful force in American life especially through their leading position among federal judges. In the final months of Adams' administration he enlarged the federal judiciary and appointed many new judges.

In the view of GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, a Federalist senator from New York, this created an independent judiciary necessary "to save the people from their most dangerous enemy, themselves."

In sharp contrast, Democratic-Republicans were appalled by the "MIDNIGHT APPOINTMENTS" that tried to continue Federalist influence despite their election loss. In Jefferson's view, the Federalists "retired into the judiciary as a stronghold . . . and from that battery all the works of Republicanism are to be beaten down and destroyed." As in so many areas, the two political parties fundamentally disagreed.



The most influential of Adams' final judicial appointments in 1801 was naming John Marshall as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He held that position until his death in 1835 and shaped the court's decisions and dramatically raised its stature. He also defined the basic relationship of the judiciary to the rest of the federal government. His forceful actions as Chief Justice set the Supreme Court on a course it has continued to follow for the next two centuries. Marshall was guided by a strong commitment to judicial power and by a belief in the supremacy of national over state legislatures. His judicial vision was very much in keeping with the Federalist political program.

John Marshall's earliest landmark decision as Chief Justice came in MARBURY V. MADISON (1803) and demonstrates his sophisticated leadership of the Court. The issue at stake was the validity of the Federalists' last-minute EXPANSION OF THE JUDICIARY IN 1801, but Marshall used the case to make a much broader statement about the relationship between the distinct branches of the federal government.

When James Madison, Jefferson's secretary of state, refused to deliver several commissions for new justices, they petitioned the Supreme Court to compel the executive to act. Marshall's written decision on behalf of the unanimous Court found that the petitioners were entitled to their commissions, but refused to take the legal action that they wanted. Rather, the court declared that the JUDICIARY ACT OF 1789, which had given the court such power, was inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore invalid.


This was a complex decision. In the specific matter before the Court, the decision limited judicial power. However, the more fundamental issue that it decided was to insist on the court's authority to declare an act of Congress void if found to be in conflict with the Constitution. As Marshall explained, "it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." Since Marbury v. Madison the Supreme Court has been the final decision maker regarding the Constitutionality of Congressional legislation.

The MARSHALL COURT, and this decision in particular, established the principle of "judicial review" whereby Congressional laws and executive actions may be judged by the Supreme Court to be within the bounds of the Constitution. In keeping with John Marshall's Federalist views, he generally favored strong government action and especially supported the supremacy of the federal government over state authorities.
