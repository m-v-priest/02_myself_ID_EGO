== 解说

=== The Vietnam War 越南战争

The VIETNAM WAR was the second-longest war in United States history, after the war in Afghanistan.
越南战争是美国历史上第二长的战争，仅次于阿富汗战争。

Promises and commitments to the people and government of South Vietnam to keep communist forces from overtaking them reached back into the Truman Administration. Eisenhower placed military advisers and CIA operatives in Vietnam, and John F. Kennedy sent American soldiers to Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson ordered the first real combat by American troops, and Richard Nixon concluded the war.
杜鲁门政府向南越人民和政府, 做出了阻止共产主义势力超越南越的承诺和承诺。艾森豪威尔在越南派遣军事顾问和中央情报局特工，约翰·肯尼迪则派遣美国士兵前往越南。林登·约翰逊下令美军进行第一次真正的战斗，理查德·尼克松结束了战争。

Despite the decades of resolve, billions and billions of dollars, nearly 60,000 American lives and many more injuries, the United States failed to achieve its objectives.
尽管几十年来下了决心，投入了数十亿美元，造成近 60,000 名美国人丧生和更多人受伤，但美国仍未能实现其目标。

One factor that influenced the failure of the United States in Vietnam was lack of public support. However, the notion that the war initially was prosecuted by the government against the wishes of the American people is false. The notion that the vast majority of American youths took to the streets to end the Vietnam War is equally false. Early initiatives by the United States under Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy received broad support.
影响美国在越南失败的因素之一, 是缺乏公众支持。然而，有关"最初战争是在违背美国人民意愿的情况下, 由政府进行"的观念是错误的。关于"绝大多数美国年轻人走上街头, 要求结束越南战争"的观念同样是错误的。在杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔和肯尼迪领导下，美国早期的行动得到了广泛支持。

Only two members of the United States Congress voted against granting Johnson broad authority to wage the war in Vietnam, and most Americans supported this measure as well. The antiwar movement in 1965 was small, and news of its activities was buried in the inner pages of newspapers, if there was any mention at all. Only later in the war did public opinion sour.
只有两名美国国会议员, 投票反对授予约翰逊在越南发动战争的广泛权力，大多数美国人也支持这一举措。 1965年的反战运动规模很小，有关其活动的新闻即使有提及，也被埋在报纸的内页中。直到战争后期，公众舆论才开始恶化。

The enemy was hard to identify. The war was not fought between conventional army forces. The Viet Cong blended in with the native population and struck by ambush, often at night. Massive American bombing campaigns hit their targets, but failed to make the North Vietnamese concede. Promises made by American military and political leaders that the war would soon be over were broken.
敌人很难辨认。战争不是在常规军队之间进行的。越共与当地居民混在一起，经常在夜间遭到伏击。美国的大规模轰炸袭击了目标，但未能使北越认输。美国军事和政治领导人关于战争很快结束的承诺, 被打破了。

And night after night, Americans turned on the news to see the bodies of their young flown home in bags. Draft injustices like college deferments surfaced, hearkening back to the similar controversies of the Civil War. The average age of the American soldier in Vietnam was nineteen. As the months of the war became years, the public became impatient.
夜复一夜，美国人打开新闻, 看到他们孩子的尸体被装在袋子里空运回家。诸如大学延期入学之类的征兵不公正现象也浮出水面(但**上大学虽然可以推迟服兵役, 但并不能豁免服役**)，让人回想起美国内战时期的类似争议。**在越南的美国士兵, 平均年龄只有十九岁。**随着战争从几个月变成几年，公众变得不耐烦了。

Only a small percentage of Americans believed their government was evil or sympathized with the Viet Cong. But many began to feel it was time to cut losses.
只有一小部分美国人认为, 他们的政府是邪恶的, 或同情越共。但许多人开始觉得是时候减少损失了。

President Nixon signed a ceasefire in January 1973 that formally ended the hostilities. In 1975, communist forces from the north overran the south and unified the nation. Neighboring CAMBODIA and LAOS also became communist dictatorships. At home, returning Vietnamese veterans found readjustment and even acceptance difficult. The scars of Vietnam would not heal quickly for the United States.
1973 年 1 月，尼克松总统签署停火协议，正式结束敌对行动。 1975年，共产党军队从北方占领南方，统一了国家。邻国柬埔寨和老挝, 也成为共产主义独裁国家。在国内，回国的越南退伍军人发现很难适应甚至接受。对于美国来说，越南的伤疤不会很快愈合。

The legacy of bitterness divided the American citizenry and influenced foreign policy into the 21st century.
痛苦的遗产使美国公民分裂，并影响了进入 21 世纪的外交政策。

==== Early Involvement 早期参与


Ho Chi Minh's resistance to colonial powers in Indochina led to the formation of the Marxist liberation movement known as the Viet Minh. The United States provided financial support to France's fight against Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh from the 1940s until direct U.S. involvement.
胡志明对印度支那殖民势力​​的抵抗, 导致了马克思主义解放运动“越明”的形成。从 20 世纪 40 年代起，美国一直为法国对抗胡志明和越盟的斗争, 提供财政支持，直至美国直接介入。

While Americans were girding to fight the Civil War in 1860, the French were beginning a century-long imperial involvement in Indochina. The lands now known as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia comprised INDOCHINA. The riches to be harvested in these lands proved economically enticing to the French.
1860 年，当美国人准备打内战(南北战争)时，法国人却开始了对印度支那长达一个世纪的帝国主义介入。现在的越南、老挝和柬埔寨, 组成了印度支那。事实证明，这些土地上收获的财富, 对法国人来说具有经济吸引力。

After World War I, a nationalist movement formed in Vietnam led by HO CHI MINH. Ho was educated in the West, where he became a disciple of Marxist thought. Ho resented and resisted the French. When the Japanese invaded Vietnam during World War II, they displaced French rule. Ho formed a liberation movement known as the Viet Minh. Using guerrilla warfare, the VIET MINH battled the Japanese and held many key cities by 1945. Paraphrasing the Declaration of Independence, Ho proclaimed the new nation of Vietnam — a new nation Western powers refused to recognize.
第一次世界大战后，胡志明领导的越南民族主义运动兴起。胡志明在西方接受教育，成为马克思主义思想的信徒。胡氏对法国人充满怨恨和抵制。第二次世界大战期间，日本入侵越南，取代了法国的统治。胡志明发起了一场名为“越盟”的解放运动。越盟通过游击战与日本人作战，并于 1945 年占领了许多重要城市。胡志明解释《独立宣言》，宣布建立新国家越南——一个西方列强拒绝承认的新国家。

France was determined to reclaim all its territories after World War II. The United States now faced an interesting dilemma. American tradition dictated sympathy for the revolutionaries over any colonial power. However, supporting the Marxist Viet Minh was unthinkable, given the new strategy of containing communism.
*第二次世界大战后，法国决心收回所有领土。美国现在面临着一个有趣的困境。美国的传统, 决定了对革命者的同情胜过对任何殖民国家的同情。然而，鉴于遏制共产主义的新战略，支持"马克思主义的越盟"是不可想象的。*

Domino Theory 多米诺骨牌理论

American diplomats subscribed to the DOMINO THEORY. A communist victory in Vietnam might lead to communist victories in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Such a scenario was unthinkable to the makers of American foreign policy.
*美国外交官认同"多米诺骨牌理论"。共产主义在越南的胜利, 可能会导致共产主义在老挝、柬埔寨、泰国、马来西亚和印度尼西亚的胜利。对于美国外交政策的制定者来说，这种情况是不可想象的。*

image:/img/096.png[,30%]

President Truman decided to support France in its efforts to reclaim Indochina by providing money and military advisers. The United States financial commitment amounted to nearly $1 billion per year.
**杜鲁门总统决定通过提供资金和军事顾问, 来支持法国收复"印度支那"的努力。**美国每年的财政承诺, 接近10亿美元。

The French found Ho Chi Minh a formidable adversary. Between 1945 and 1954 a fierce war developed between the two sides. Slowly but surely, the Viet Minh wore down the French will to fight. On May, 8th, 1954 a large regiment of French troops was captured by the Vietnamese led by communist general VO NGUYEN GIAP at DIEN BIEN PHU.
法国人认为胡志明是一个可怕的对手。 1945年至1954年间，双方爆发了激烈的战争。越盟缓慢但肯定地削弱了法国人的战斗意志。 1954 年 5 月 8 日，一个大团的法国军队, 在奠边府被共产党将军武元甲领导的越南军队俘获。

A Nation Divided 一个分裂的国家

The rest of the French troops withdrew, leaving a buffer zone separating the North and South. Negotiations to end the conflict took place in Geneva. A multinational agreement divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel. The territory north of this line would be led by Ho Chi Minh with Hanoi its capital.
**其余法军撤出，留下分隔南北的缓冲区。**结束冲突的谈判, 在日内瓦举行。一项多国协议以北纬 17 度线, 划分越南。这条线以北的领土, 将由胡志明领导，首都"河内"。

The southern sector named Saigon its capital and Ngo Dinh Diem its leader. This division was meant to be temporary, with nationwide elections scheduled for 1956. Knowing that Ho Chi Minh would be a sure victor, the South made sure these elections were never held.
南部地区将"西贡"定为首都，吴庭艳为领导人。*这种分裂本来是暂时的，全国选举定于 1956 年举行。南方知道胡志明一定会获胜，因此确保这些选举永远不会举行。*

During the administrations of Eisenhower and Kennedy, the United States continued to supply funds, weapons, and military advisers to SOUTH VIETNAM. Ho Chi Minh turned NORTH VIETNAM into a communist dictatorship and created a new band of GUERRILLAS in the South called the Viet Cong, whose sole purpose was to overthrow the military regime in the South and reunite the nation under Ho Chi Minh.
在艾森豪威尔和肯尼迪执政期间，美国继续向"南越"提供资金、武器和军事顾问。胡志明将"北越"变成了共产主义独裁政权，并在南方创建了一支新的游击队，称为"越共"，其唯一目的是推翻南方的军政权, 并在胡志明领导下重新统一国家。

The United States was backing an unpopular leader in NGO DINH DIEM. Diem was corrupt, showed little commitment to democratic principles, and favored Catholics to the dismay of the Buddhist majority. In November 1963, Diem was murdered in a coup with apparent CIA involvement.
美国支持吴廷琰(吴庭艳)（NGO DINH DIEM）(原南越总统) , 他是一位不受欢迎的领导人。吴庭艳腐败，对民主原则缺乏承诺，而且偏袒天主教徒，这令大多数佛教徒感到沮丧。 1963 年 11 月，吴庭艳在一场明显有中央情报局参与的政变中被谋杀。

Few of Ngo's successors fared any better, while Ho Chi Minh was the Vietnamese equivalent of George Washington. He had successfully won the hearts and minds of the majority of the Vietnamese people. Two weeks after the fall of Diem, Kennedy himself was felled by an assassin's bullet.
吴庭艳的继任者中, 很少有人表现得更好，而胡志明则相当于越南的乔治·华盛顿。他成功赢得了广大越南人民的心。吴庭艳倒台两周后，肯尼迪本人也被刺客的子弹击中身亡。

By the time Lyndon Johnson inherited the Presidency, Vietnam was a bitterly divided nation. The United States would soon too be divided on what to do in Vietnam.
当林登·约翰逊继承总统职位时，越南已是一个严重分裂的国家。美国很快也会在越南问题上出现分歧。

.Lyndon Johnson
image:/img/Lyndon Johnson.jpg[,20%]

1963年至1969年, 担任第36任美国总统.

约翰逊以其专横粗暴性格闻名，不时透过“约翰逊待遇”迫使有权势的政客支持推动其立法。

**约翰逊被受共和党建议提出了“伟大社会”这一立法举措，推动维护民权、公共广播、联邦医保、医疗补助、教育援助、艺术、城市及乡村发展、公共服务及“向贫穷宣战”。**在约翰逊任内，向贫穷宣战政策及经济的发展, 使数百万美国人脱离了贫困阶层。

*约翰逊同时签署了一系列民权法案，禁止在公共设施、跨州贸易、工作场所及住房领域进行种族歧视，*《选举权法案》则取缔了南方一些州对非裔美国人"选举权"进行的限制。 +
《1965年移民及国籍法案》则改革了美国的移民体系，以种族为尺度的移民配额制度终结，以国籍为尺度的制度开始实施。

史学家称, "新政"时期后的美国现代自由主义, 在约翰逊任内达到了顶峰。由于其在国内政绩优异，推动立法对民权、枪支管制、原野保护, 及社会保险等有重大影响，尽管他对外在越战上受挫，许多史学家对其评价仍旧颇为积极，在美国总统排名中依旧较为靠前。

==== Years of Escalation: 1965-68   / 升级年份：1965-68


It was David vs. Goliath, with U.S. playing Goliath.
这是大卫与歌利亚的较量，美国队扮演歌利亚。

On August 2, 1964, gunboats of North Vietnam allegedly fired on ships of the United States Navy stationed in the GULF OF TONKIN. They had been sailing 10 miles off the coast of North Vietnam in support of the South Vietnamese navy.
1964年8月2日，北越炮艇据称向驻扎在东京湾的美国海军舰艇开火。他们当时正在距北越海岸10英里处航行，以支援南越海军。

When reports that further firing occurred on August 4, President Johnson quickly asked Congress to respond. With nearly unanimous consent, members of the Senate and House empowered Johnson to "take all necessary measures" to repel North Vietnamese aggression. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution gave the President a "BLANK CHECK" to wage the war in Vietnam as he saw fit. After Lyndon Johnson was elected President in his own right that November, he chose escalate the conflict.
当8月4日有报道称再次开火时，约翰逊总统迅速要求国会作出回应。参议院和众议院几乎一致同意，授权约翰逊“采取一切必要措施”击退北越的侵略。北部湾决议给了总统一张“空白支票”，可以在他认为合适的情况下发动越南战争。当年11月，林登·约翰逊以自己的身份当选总统后，他选择了使冲突升级。

Operation Rolling Thunder
滚雷行动

In February 1965, the United States began a long program of sustained bombing of North Vietnamese targets known as OPERATION ROLLING THUNDER. At first only military targets were hit, but as months turned into years, civilian targets were pummeled as well.
1965 年 2 月，美国开始了一项名为“滚雷行动”的长期计划，对北越目标进行持续轰炸。起初只有军事目标受到打击，但随着时间的推移，民用目标也受到打击。

The United States also bombed the Ho Chi Minh trail, a supply line used by the North Vietnamese to aid the VIETCONG. The trail meandered through Laos and Cambodia, so the bombing was kept secret from the Congress and the American people. More bombs rained down on Vietnam than the Allies used on the Axis powers during the whole of World War II.
美国还轰炸了胡志明小道，这是北越用来援助"越共"的补给线。这条路线蜿蜒穿过老挝和柬埔寨，因此爆炸事件对国会和美国人民保密。整个二战期间，落在越南的炸弹数量, 比盟军对轴心国使用的炸弹数量还多。

Additional sorties delivered defoliating agents such as AGENT ORANGE and napalm to remove the jungle cover utilized by the Vietcong. The intense bombardment did little to deter the communists. They continued to use the Ho Chi Minh trail despite the grave risk. The burrowed underground, building 30,000 miles of tunnel networks to keep supply lines open.
其他架次还运送了橙剂和凝固汽油弹等脱叶剂，以清除越共使用的丛林覆盖物。猛烈的轰炸并没有阻止共产党人。尽管存在严重风险，他们仍继续使用胡志明小道。他们在地下挖洞，建造了 30,000 英里的隧道网络，以保持补给线畅通。

Ground Troops 地面部队

Agent Orange +
Often unable to see the enemy through the dense growth of Vietnam's jungles, the U.S. military sprayed a chemical herbicide known as "Agent Orange" in an attempt to destroy the trees. Currently, debate rages on whether or not exposure to this compound is responsible for disease and disability in many Vietnam veterans.
由于越南茂密的丛林常常无法看到敌人，美军喷洒了一种名为“橙剂”的化学除草剂，试图摧毁树木。目前，关于接触这种化合物是否会导致许多越南退伍军人患病和残疾的争论十分激烈。

It soon became clear to GENERAL WILLIAM WESTMORELAND, the American military commander, that combat troops would be necessary to root out the enemy. Beginning in March 1965, when the first American combat troops waded ashore at Danang, the United States began "search and destroy" missions.
美国军事指挥官威廉·威斯特摩兰将军, 很快就清楚地认识到，需要作战部队来铲除敌人。 1965年3月，当第一批美国作战部队在岘港涉水登陆时，美国开始了“搜索和摧毁”任务。

One of the most confounding problems faced by U.S. military personnel in Vietnam was identifying the enemy. The same Vietnamese peasant who waved hello in the daytime might be a VC guerrilla fighter by night. The United States could not indiscriminately kill South Vietnamese peasants. Any mistake resulted in a dead ally and an angrier population.
在越南的美国军事人员面临的最令人困惑的问题之一是识别敌人。白天挥手打招呼的越南农民，晚上可能就是越共游击战士。美国不能不分青红皂白地杀害南越农民。任何错误都会导致盟友死亡和民众愤怒。

Search and destroy missions were conducted by moving into a village and inspecting for any signs of Vietcong support. If any evidence was found, the troops would conduct a "ZIPPO RAID" by torching the village to the ground and confiscating discovered munitions. Most efforts were fruitless, as the VC proved adept at covering their tracks. The enemy surrounded and confounded the Americans but direct confrontation was rare.
搜索和摧毁任务是通过进入一个村庄，检查越共支持的任何迹象来执行的。如果发现任何证据，部队将进行“ZIPPO突袭”，将村庄烧为平地，没收发现的弹药。大多数努力都是徒劳的，因为事实证明 VC 善于掩盖他们的踪迹。敌人包围并迷惑了美国人，但直接对抗的情况很少见。


By the end of 1965, there were American 189,000 troops stationed in Vietnam. At the end of the following year, that number doubled. Casualty reports steadily increased. Unlike World War II, there few major ground battles.
截至1965年底，美国在越南驻军有18.9万人。次年年底，这个数字翻了一番。伤亡报告稳步增加。*与第二次世界大战不同的是，很少有大规模的地面战斗。*

Most Vietnamese attacks were by ambush or night skirmishes. Many Americans died by stepping on landmines or by triggering BOOBY TRAPS. Although Vietnamese body counts were higher, Americans were dying at rate of approximately 100 per week through 1967. By the end of that year there were nearly 500,000 American combat troops stationed in Vietnam.
越南的进攻大多是伏击或夜间小冲突。许多美国人死于踩到地雷或触发饵雷。尽管越南人的死亡人数更高，但到1967年，美国人的死亡率大约为每周100人。到那年年底，有近50万美国作战部队驻扎在越南。

General Westmoreland promised a settlement soon, but the end was not in sight.
威斯特摩兰将军承诺尽快解决问题，但结局却遥遥无期。


'''


==== The Tet Offensive


During the BUDDHIST holiday of TET, over 80,000 Vietcong troops emerged from their tunnels and attacked nearly every major metropolitan center in South Vietnam. Surprise strikes were made at the American base at DANANG, and even the seemingly impenetrable American embassy in SAIGON was attacked.
在佛教节日春节期间，超过 80,000 名越共军队从地道中涌出，袭击了南越几乎所有主要大都市中心。美国在岘港的基地遭到突然袭击，甚至看似坚不可摧的美国驻西贡大使馆, 也遭到袭击。

During the weeks that followed, the South Vietnamese army and U.S. ground forces recaptured all of the lost territory, inflicting twice as many casualties on the Vietcong as suffered by the Americans.
在接下来的几周内，南越军队和美国地面部队, 重新夺回了所有失去的领土，给"越共"造成的伤亡是美国人的两倍。

The showdown was a military victory for the United States, but American morale suffered an insurmountable blow.
这次对决是美国军事上的胜利，但美国的士气却遭受了难以克服的打击。

Doves Outnumber Hawks 鸽派数量超过鹰派

When Operation Rolling Thunder began in 1965, only 15 percent of the American public opposed the war effort in Vietnam. As late as January 1968, only a few weeks before Tet, only 28 percent of the American public labeled themselves "doves." But by April 1968, six weeks after the TET OFFENSIVE, "DOVES" outnumbered "HAWKS" 42 to 41 percent.
1965 年“滚雷行动”开始时，只有 15% 的美国公众反对越南战争。直到 1968 年 1 月，距离春节仅几周，只有 28% 的美国公众称自己为“鸽派”。但到了 1968 年 4 月，即春节攻势六周后，“鸽派”的人数超过了“鹰派”的 42% 到 41%。

Only 28% of the American people were satisfied with President Johnson's handling of the war. The Tet Offensive convinced many Americans that government statements about the war being nearly over were false. After three years of intense bombing, billions of dollars and 500,000 troops, the VC proved themselves capable of attacking anywhere they chose. The message was simple: this war was not almost over. The end was nowhere in sight.
只有28%的美国民众对约翰逊总统对战争的处理感到满意。春节攻势让许多美国人相信，政府关于"战争即将结束"的声明是错误的。*经过三年的猛烈轰炸、数十亿美元和 50 万军队，越共证明了自己有能力攻击任何他们选择的地方。传达的信息很简单：这场战争还没有结束。结局还看不到尽头。*

Sagging U.S. Troop Morale
美军士气低落

Declining public support brought declining troop morale. Many soldiers questioned the wisdom of American involvement. Soldiers indulged in alcohol, marijuana, and even heroin to escape their daily horrors. Incidents of "FRAGGING," or the murder of officers by their own troops increased in the years that followed Tet. Soldiers who completed their yearlong tour of duty often found hostile receptions upon returning to the states.
**公众支持率下降, 导致部队士气下降。**许多士兵质疑美国参与其中是否明智。**士兵们沉迷于酒精、大麻甚至海洛因来逃避日常的恐惧。**春节之后的几年里，“FRAGGING”（即自己部队谋杀军官）的事件有所增加。完成一年服役期的士兵返回各州后, 经常会受到敌意的接待。

General William Westmoreland

Following the Tet Offensive, General William Westmoreland called for an additional 200,000 troops to help break the resolve of the Vietcong. But President Lyndon B. Johnson's rejection of the proposal showed that America's commitment to the war in Vietnam was waning.
春节攻势结束后，威廉·威斯特摩兰将军呼吁增派 20 万军队，以帮助"瓦解越共"的决心。但林登·约翰逊总统拒绝了该提议，这表明美国对越南战争的承诺正在减弱。

After Tet, General Westmoreland requested an additional 200,000 troops to put added pressure on the Vietcong. His request was denied. President Johnson knew that activating that many reserves, bringing the total American commitment to nearly three quarters of a million soldiers was not politically tenable.
春节过后，威斯特摩兰将军请求增派 20 万军队，以对越共施加更大压力。他的请求被拒绝了。约翰逊总统知道，动用如此多的后备力量，让美国承诺提供近四分之三的百万士兵，这在政治上是站不住脚的。

The North Vietnamese sensed the crumbling of American resolve. They knew that the longer the war raged, the more antiwar sentiment in America would grow. They gambled that the American people would demand troop withdrawals before the military met its objectives.
*北越人感受到了美国决心的崩溃。他们知道，战争持续的时间越长，美国的反战情绪就会越高涨。他们赌美国人民会要求在军队实现目标之前撤军。*

For the next five years they pretended to negotiate with United States, making proposals they knew would be rejected. With each passing day, the number of "hawks" in America decreased. Only a small percentage of Americans objected to the war on moral grounds, but a growing majority saw the war as an effort whose price of victory was way too high.
**在接下来的五年里，他们假装与美国谈判，提出他们知道会被拒绝的建议。**美国“鹰派”的数量与日俱增。只有一小部分美国人出于道义理由反对这场战争，但越来越多的人认为这场战争的胜利代价太高了。

'''


==== The Antiwar Movement 反战运动


Of all the lessons learned from Vietnam, one rings louder than all the rest — it is impossible to win a long, protracted war without popular support.
*在从越南战争中吸取的所有教训中，有一个比其他教训更响亮：没有民众的支持，就不可能赢得一场长期持久的战争。*

When the war in Vietnam began, many Americans believed that defending South Vietnam from communist aggression was in the national interest. Communism was threatening free governments across the globe. Any sign of non-intervention from the United States might encourage revolutions elsewhere.
当越南战争开始时，*许多美国人认为保卫南越免受共产主义侵略, 符合美国国家利益。共产主义正在威胁全球的自由政府。美国任何不干预的迹象, 都可能会鼓励其他地方的革命。*

As the war dragged on, more and more Americans grew weary of mounting casualties and escalating costs. The small antiwar movement grew into an unstoppable force, pressuring American leaders to reconsider its commitment.
随着战争的拖延，越来越多的美国人对不断增加的伤亡, 和不断上升的费用, 感到厌倦。这场小型反战运动发展成为一股不可阻挡的力量，迫使美国领导人重新考虑其承诺。

PEACE MOVEMENT leaders opposed the war on moral and economic grounds. The North Vietnamese, they argued, were fighting a patriotic war to rid themselves of foreign aggressors. Innocent Vietnamese peasants were being killed in the crossfire. American planes wrought environmental damage by dropping their defoliating chemicals.
和平运动领导人, 从道德和经济角度反对这场战争。他们认为，北越人正在进行一场爱国战争，以摆脱外国侵略者。无辜的越南农民在交火中被杀害。美国飞机投放落叶化学物质造成了环境破坏。

Ho Chi Minh was the most popular leader in all of Vietnam, and the United States was supporting an undemocratic, corrupt military regime. Young American soldiers were suffering and dying. Their economic arguments were less complex, but as critical of the war effort. Military spending simply took money away from Great Society social programs such as welfare, housing, and urban renewal.
胡志明是越南最受欢迎的领导人，而美国支持的是一个不民主、腐败的军事政权。年轻的美国士兵正在遭受痛苦和死亡。他们在经济问题上的论点没有那么复杂，但同样对战争努力持批评态度。军费开支只是从福利、住房和城市更新等“伟大社会”社会项目中拿走了钱。

The Draft 草案

The draft was another major source of resentment among college students. The age of the average American soldier serving in Vietnam was 19, seven years younger than its World War II counterpart. Students observed that young Americans were legally old enough to fight and die, but were not permitted to vote or drink alcohol. Such criticism led to the 26TH AMENDMENT, which granted suffrage to 18-year-olds.
该草案是大学生不满的另一个主要根源。*在越南服役的美国士兵的平均年龄为 19 岁，比二战时期的士兵年轻 7 岁。学生们观察到，年轻的美国人在法律上已经达到了可以战斗和死亡的年龄，但不允许投票或喝酒。此类批评导致了第 26 条修正案的出台，该修正案赋予 18 岁青少年选举权。*

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution 美国宪法第二十六修正案
第二十六修正案是因应反越战学生运动下的产物. **早在第二次世界大战期间，当时的总统富兰克林·D·罗斯福就通过法案, 将征兵年龄降低到了18岁，然而这些年轻人却很多都连"投票表明立场"或自我保护的权力都没有。“有资格打战，有资格投票”**成为了越战期间美国一个非常具有标志性的反战口号。  +

第二十六修正案的内容是: 年满十八岁和十八岁以上的合众国公民的"选举权"，不得因为年龄而被合众国或任何一州加以拒绝或限制。 +
*即, 自1972年起，年满18岁的美国公民, 正式享有投票权。*

====



Because DRAFT DEFERMENTS were granted to college students, the less affluent and less educated made up a disproportionate percentage of combat troops. Once drafted, Americans with higher levels of education were often given military office jobs. About 80 percent of American ground troops in Vietnam came from the lower classes. Latino and African American males were assigned to combat more regularly than drafted white Americans.
*由于"延期征兵"是授予大学生的权力，因此不太富裕和受教育程度较低的人, 在作战部队中所占比例过高(所以好好学习, 能救你的命. 又犹如二战中, 日本将文科生派去打仗, 文科生战死率高, 理科生死亡率低)。一旦应征入伍，受过高等教育的美国人, 往往会获得军事办公室的职位。大约80%的美国驻越南地面部队来自下层阶级。拉丁裔和非裔美国男性, 比应征入伍的美国白人更频繁地被派去参战。*

Antiwar demonstrations were few at first, with active participants numbering in the low thousands when Congress passed the TONKIN GULF RESOLUTION. Events in Southeast Asia and at home caused those numbers to grow as the years passed. As the Johnson Administration escalated the commitment, the peace movement grew. Television changed many minds. Millions of Americans watched body bags leave the Asian rice paddies every night in their living rooms.
反战示威活动一开始很少，当国会通过"东京湾决议"时，反战活动的活跃参与者只有数千人。东南亚和国内发生的事件, 导致这些数字随着时间的推移而不断增长。随着约翰逊政府加大承诺力度，和平运动不断发展。电视改变了许多人的想法。数以百万计的美国人每天晚上在客厅里看着尸袋离开亚洲稻田。

Give Peace a Chance
给和平一个机会

The late 1960s became increasingly radical as the activists felt their demands were ignored. Peaceful demonstrations turned violent. When the police arrived to arrest protesters, the crowds often retaliated. Students occupied buildings across college campuses forcing many schools to cancel classes.

==== Years of Withdrawal 戒断年限


President Nixon had a plan to end American involvement in Vietnam.
尼克松总统制定了一项结束美国介入越南的计划。

By the time he entered the White House in 1969, he knew the American war effort was failing. Greater military power may have brought a favorable outcome, but there were no guarantees. And the American people were less and less willing to support any sort of escalation with each passing day.
1969 年入主白宫时，他知道美国的战争努力正在失败。更强大的军事力量可能会带来有利的结果，但并不能保证结果必然如此。随着时间的推移，美国人民越来越不愿意支持任何形式的升级。

Immediate American withdrawal would amount to a defeat of the noncommunist South Vietnamese allies. Nixon announced a plan later known as VIETNAMIZATION. The United States would gradually withdraw troops from Southeast Asia as American military personnel turned more and more of the fighting over to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. In theory, as the South Vietnamese became more able to defend themselves, United States soldiers could go home without a communist takeover of Saigon.
美国立即撤军, 将意味着非共产主义的"南越"盟友的失败。尼克松宣布了一项后来被称为"越南化"的计划。随着美国军事人员将越来越多的战斗任务, 交给越南共和国陆军，美国将逐渐从东南亚撤军。理论上，随着南越人变得更有能力自卫，美国士兵可以在"共产党不占领西贡"的情况下回家。

Troop withdrawals did little to placate the antiwar movement. Demonstrators wanted an immediate and complete departure. Events in Vietnam and at home gave greater strength to the protesters.
撤军并没有安抚反战运动。示威者希望立即彻底撤离。越南和国内发生的事件, 给抗议者带来了更大的力量。

In the spring of 1970, President Nixon announced a temporary invasion of neighboring Cambodia. Although Cambodia was technically neutral, the Ho Chi Minh trail stretched through its territory. Nixon ordered the Viet Cong bases located along the trail to be bombed.
1970年春，尼克松总统宣布暂时入侵邻国柬埔寨。尽管柬埔寨在技术上保持中立，但胡志明小道贯穿其领土。尼克松下令轰炸沿途的越共基地。

Kent State and MY LAI MASSACRES
肯特州立大学和我莱屠杀事件

Peace advocates were enraged. They claimed that Nixon was expanding the war, not reducing it as promised. Protests were mounted across America.
和平倡导者被激怒了。他们声称尼克松正在扩大战争，而不是按照承诺减少战争。美国各地爆发了抗议活动。

At KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, students rioted in protest. The burned down the ROTC building located on campus, and destroyed local property. The governor of Ohio sent the National Guard to maintain order. A state of high tension and confusion hung between the Guard and the students. Several soldiers fired their rifles, leading to deaths of four students and the wounding of several others. This became known as the Kent State massacre.
在肯特州立大学，学生发生骚乱抗议。他们烧毁了校园内的后备军官训练队大楼，并毁坏了当地财产。俄亥俄州州长派出国民警卫队维持秩序。警卫和学生之间笼罩着高度紧张和混乱的气氛。几名士兵开枪射击，导致四名学生死亡，数人受伤。这被称为肯特州立大屠杀。


The following year the American public learned about the My Lai massacre. In 1968, American soldiers opened fire on several hundred women and children in the tiny hamlet of My Lai. How could this happen? It was not unusual for Viet Cong guerilla activity to be initiated from small villages. Further, U.S. troops were tired, scared, and confused.
次年，美国公众得知了美莱村惨案。 1968 年，美国士兵在美莱小村庄向数百名妇女和儿童开枪。怎么会发生这种事？越共游击活动从小村庄发起的情况并不罕见。此外，美军感到疲倦、恐惧和困惑。

At first the Lieutenant who had given the order, WILLIAM L. CALLEY, JR., was declared guilty of murder, but the ruling was later overturned. Moral outrage swept through the antiwar movement. They cited My Lai as an example of how American soldiers were killing innocent peasants.
最初下达命令的中尉小威廉·L·卡利被宣布犯有谋杀罪，但该裁决后来被推翻。道德义愤席卷了反战运动。他们引用美莱村为例，说明美国士兵如何杀害无辜农民。

The Pentagon Papers 五角大楼文件

In 1971, the New York Times published excerpts from the PENTAGON PAPERS, a top-secret overview of the history of government involvement in Vietnam. A participant in the study named DANIEL ELLSBERG believed the American public needed to know some of the secrets, so he leaked information to the press. The Pentagon Papers revealed a high-level deception of the American public by the Johnson Administration.
1971 年，《纽约时报》发表了五角大楼文件的摘录，这是政府参与越南历史的绝密概述。这项研究的参与者丹尼尔·埃尔斯伯格认为美国公众需要了解一些秘密，因此他向媒体泄露了信息。五角大楼文件揭露了约翰逊政府对美国公众的高层欺骗。

Evacuation of Saigon

The North Vietnamese Army captured Saigon in April, 1975, and renamed the capital Ho Chi Minh City. It was at this time that the last remaining American personnel in Vietnam were forced to flee.
1975年4月，北越军队占领西贡，并将首都改名为胡志明市。正是在这个时候，最后一批留在越南的美国人员被迫逃离。

Many statements released about the military situation in Vietnam were simply untrue, including the possibility that even the bombing of American naval boats in the Gulf of Tonkin might never have happened. A growing credibility gap between the truth and what the government said was true caused many Americans to grow even more cynical about the war.
许多有关越南军事局势的声明, 根本不真实，包括甚至可能永远不会发生"在北部湾轰炸美国海军舰艇"的可能性。事实与政府所说的真实之间的可信度差距越来越大，导致许多美国人对战争变得更加愤世嫉俗。

By December 1972, Nixon decided to escalate the bombing of North Vietnamese cities, including Hanoi. He hoped this initiative would push North Vietnam to the peace table. In January 1973, a ceasefire was reached, and the remaining American combat troops were withdrawn. Nixon called the agreement "peace with honor," but he knew the South Vietnamese Army would have difficulty maintaining control.
1972 年 12 月，*尼克松决定升级对包括河内在内的北越城市的轰炸。他希望这一举措能够将北越推向和平谈判桌 (以打促谈, 打是为了提高自己在谈判桌上的筹码)。* 1973年1月，双方达成停火，剩余的美国作战部队撤出。尼克松称该协议是“有荣誉的和平”，但他知道南越军队将很难维持控制。

The North soon attacked the South and in April 1975 they captured Saigon. Vietnam was united into one communist nation. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. Cambodia and Laos soon followed with communist regimes of their own. The United States was finally out of Vietnam. But every single one of its political objectives for the region met with failure.
北方很快就攻击了南方，并于 1975 年 4 月占领了西贡。越南统一为一个共产主义国家。西贡改名为胡志明市。柬埔寨和老挝, 很快也建立了自己的共产主义政权。美国终于从越南撤军了。但其对该地区的每一项政治目标都失败了。

Over 55,000 Americans perished fighting the Vietnam War.
*超过 55,000 名美国人在越南战争中丧生。*

=== The Vietnam War

The VIETNAM WAR was the second-longest war in United States history, after the war in Afghanistan.

Promises and commitments to the people and government of South Vietnam to keep communist forces from overtaking them reached back into the Truman Administration. Eisenhower placed military advisers and CIA operatives in Vietnam, and John F. Kennedy sent American soldiers to Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson ordered the first real combat by American troops, and Richard Nixon concluded the war.

Despite the decades of resolve, billions and billions of dollars, nearly 60,000 American lives and many more injuries, the United States failed to achieve its objectives.

One factor that influenced the failure of the United States in Vietnam was lack of public support. However, the notion that the war initially was prosecuted by the government against the wishes of the American people is false. The notion that the vast majority of American youths took to the streets to end the Vietnam War is equally false. Early initiatives by the United States under Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy received broad support.

Only two members of the United States Congress voted against granting Johnson broad authority to wage the war in Vietnam, and most Americans supported this measure as well. The antiwar movement in 1965 was small, and news of its activities was buried in the inner pages of newspapers, if there was any mention at all. Only later in the war did public opinion sour.

The enemy was hard to identify. The war was not fought between conventional army forces. The Viet Cong blended in with the native population and struck by ambush, often at night. Massive American bombing campaigns hit their targets, but failed to make the North Vietnamese concede. Promises made by American military and political leaders that the war would soon be over were broken.

And night after night, Americans turned on the news to see the bodies of their young flown home in bags. Draft injustices like college deferments surfaced, hearkening back to the similar controversies of the Civil War. The average age of the American soldier in Vietnam was nineteen. As the months of the war became years, the public became impatient.



Only a small percentage of Americans believed their government was evil or sympathized with the Viet Cong. But many began to feel it was time to cut losses.

President Nixon signed a ceasefire in January 1973 that formally ended the hostilities. In 1975, communist forces from the north overran the south and unified the nation. Neighboring CAMBODIA and LAOS also became communist dictatorships. At home, returning Vietnamese veterans found readjustment and even acceptance difficult. The scars of Vietnam would not heal quickly for the United States.

The legacy of bitterness divided the American citizenry and influenced foreign policy into the 21st century.

==== Early Involvement


Ho Chi Minh's resistance to colonial powers in Indochina led to the formation of the Marxist liberation movement known as the Viet Minh. The United States provided financial support to France's fight against Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh from the 1940s until direct U.S. involvement.

While Americans were girding to fight the Civil War in 1860, the French were beginning a century-long imperial involvement in Indochina. The lands now known as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia comprised INDOCHINA. The riches to be harvested in these lands proved economically enticing to the French.


After World War I, a nationalist movement formed in Vietnam led by HO CHI MINH. Ho was educated in the West, where he became a disciple of Marxist thought. Ho resented and resisted the French. When the Japanese invaded Vietnam during World War II, they displaced French rule. Ho formed a liberation movement known as the Viet Minh. Using guerrilla warfare, the VIET MINH battled the Japanese and held many key cities by 1945. Paraphrasing the Declaration of Independence, Ho proclaimed the new nation of Vietnam — a new nation Western powers refused to recognize.

France was determined to reclaim all its territories after World War II. The United States now faced an interesting dilemma. American tradition dictated sympathy for the revolutionaries over any colonial power. However, supporting the Marxist Viet Minh was unthinkable, given the new strategy of containing communism.

Domino Theory

American diplomats subscribed to the DOMINO THEORY. A communist victory in Vietnam might lead to communist victories in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Such a scenario was unthinkable to the makers of American foreign policy.


President Truman decided to support France in its efforts to reclaim Indochina by providing money and military advisers. The United States financial commitment amounted to nearly $1 billion per year.

The French found Ho Chi Minh a formidable adversary. Between 1945 and 1954 a fierce war developed between the two sides. Slowly but surely, the Viet Minh wore down the French will to fight. On May, 8th, 1954 a large regiment of French troops was captured by the Vietnamese led by communist general VO NGUYEN GIAP at DIEN BIEN PHU.

A Nation Divided

The rest of the French troops withdrew, leaving a buffer zone separating the North and South. Negotiations to end the conflict took place in Geneva. A multinational agreement divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel. The territory north of this line would be led by Ho Chi Minh with Hanoi its capital.

The southern sector named Saigon its capital and Ngo Dinh Diem its leader. This division was meant to be temporary, with nationwide elections scheduled for 1956. Knowing that Ho Chi Minh would be a sure victor, the South made sure these elections were never held.

During the administrations of Eisenhower and Kennedy, the United States continued to supply funds, weapons, and military advisers to SOUTH VIETNAM. Ho Chi Minh turned NORTH VIETNAM into a communist dictatorship and created a new band of GUERRILLAS in the South called the Viet Cong, whose sole purpose was to overthrow the military regime in the South and reunite the nation under Ho Chi Minh.

The United States was backing an unpopular leader in NGO DINH DIEM. Diem was corrupt, showed little commitment to democratic principles, and favored Catholics to the dismay of the Buddhist majority. In November 1963, Diem was murdered in a coup with apparent CIA involvement.

Few of Ngo's successors fared any better, while Ho Chi Minh was the Vietnamese equivalent of George Washington. He had successfully won the hearts and minds of the majority of the Vietnamese people. Two weeks after the fall of Diem, Kennedy himself was felled by an assassin's bullet.

By the time Lyndon Johnson inherited the Presidency, Vietnam was a bitterly divided nation. The United States would soon too be divided on what to do in Vietnam.

==== Years of Escalation: 1965-68


It was David vs. Goliath, with U.S. playing Goliath.

On August 2, 1964, gunboats of North Vietnam allegedly fired on ships of the United States Navy stationed in the GULF OF TONKIN. They had been sailing 10 miles off the coast of North Vietnam in support of the South Vietnamese navy.

When reports that further firing occurred on August 4, President Johnson quickly asked Congress to respond. With nearly unanimous consent, members of the Senate and House empowered Johnson to "take all necessary measures" to repel North Vietnamese aggression. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution gave the President a "BLANK CHECK" to wage the war in Vietnam as he saw fit. After Lyndon Johnson was elected President in his own right that November, he chose escalate the conflict.

Operation Rolling Thunder

In February 1965, the United States began a long program of sustained bombing of North Vietnamese targets known as OPERATION ROLLING THUNDER. At first only military targets were hit, but as months turned into years, civilian targets were pummeled as well.

The United States also bombed the Ho Chi Minh trail, a supply line used by the North Vietnamese to aid the VIETCONG. The trail meandered through Laos and Cambodia, so the bombing was kept secret from the Congress and the American people. More bombs rained down on Vietnam than the Allies used on the Axis powers during the whole of World War II.

Additional sorties delivered defoliating agents such as AGENT ORANGE and napalm to remove the jungle cover utilized by the Vietcong. The intense bombardment did little to deter the communists. They continued to use the Ho Chi Minh trail despite the grave risk. The burrowed underground, building 30,000 miles of tunnel networks to keep supply lines open.

Ground Troops

Agent Orange +
Often unable to see the enemy through the dense growth of Vietnam's jungles, the U.S. military sprayed a chemical herbicide known as "Agent Orange" in an attempt to destroy the trees. Currently, debate rages on whether or not exposure to this compound is responsible for disease and disability in many Vietnam veterans.

It soon became clear to GENERAL WILLIAM WESTMORELAND, the American military commander, that combat troops would be necessary to root out the enemy. Beginning in March 1965, when the first American combat troops waded ashore at Danang, the United States began "search and destroy" missions.

One of the most confounding problems faced by U.S. military personnel in Vietnam was identifying the enemy. The same Vietnamese peasant who waved hello in the daytime might be a VC guerrilla fighter by night. The United States could not indiscriminately kill South Vietnamese peasants. Any mistake resulted in a dead ally and an angrier population.

Search and destroy missions were conducted by moving into a village and inspecting for any signs of Vietcong support. If any evidence was found, the troops would conduct a "ZIPPO RAID" by torching the village to the ground and confiscating discovered munitions. Most efforts were fruitless, as the VC proved adept at covering their tracks. The enemy surrounded and confounded the Americans but direct confrontation was rare.


By the end of 1965, there were American 189,000 troops stationed in Vietnam. At the end of the following year, that number doubled. Casualty reports steadily increased. Unlike World War II, there few major ground battles.

Most Vietnamese attacks were by ambush or night skirmishes. Many Americans died by stepping on landmines or by triggering BOOBY TRAPS. Although Vietnamese body counts were higher, Americans were dying at rate of approximately 100 per week through 1967. By the end of that year there were nearly 500,000 American combat troops stationed in Vietnam.

General Westmoreland promised a settlement soon, but the end was not in sight.


'''


==== The Tet Offensive


During the BUDDHIST holiday of TET, over 80,000 Vietcong troops emerged from their tunnels and attacked nearly every major metropolitan center in South Vietnam. Surprise strikes were made at the American base at DANANG, and even the seemingly impenetrable American embassy in SAIGON was attacked.

During the weeks that followed, the South Vietnamese army and U.S. ground forces recaptured all of the lost territory, inflicting twice as many casualties on the Vietcong as suffered by the Americans.

The showdown was a military victory for the United States, but American morale suffered an insurmountable blow.

Doves Outnumber Hawks

When Operation Rolling Thunder began in 1965, only 15 percent of the American public opposed the war effort in Vietnam. As late as January 1968, only a few weeks before Tet, only 28 percent of the American public labeled themselves "doves." But by April 1968, six weeks after the TET OFFENSIVE, "DOVES" outnumbered "HAWKS" 42 to 41 percent.

Only 28% of the American people were satisfied with President Johnson's handling of the war. The Tet Offensive convinced many Americans that government statements about the war being nearly over were false. After three years of intense bombing, billions of dollars and 500,000 troops, the VC proved themselves capable of attacking anywhere they chose. The message was simple: this war was not almost over. The end was nowhere in sight.

Sagging U.S. Troop Morale

Declining public support brought declining troop morale. Many soldiers questioned the wisdom of American involvement. Soldiers indulged in alcohol, marijuana, and even heroin to escape their daily horrors. Incidents of "FRAGGING," or the murder of officers by their own troops increased in the years that followed Tet. Soldiers who completed their yearlong tour of duty often found hostile receptions upon returning to the states.

General William Westmoreland

Following the Tet Offensive, General William Westmoreland called for an additional 200,000 troops to help break the resolve of the Vietcong. But President Lyndon B. Johnson's rejection of the proposal showed that America's commitment to the war in Vietnam was waning.

After Tet, General Westmoreland requested an additional 200,000 troops to put added pressure on the Vietcong. His request was denied. President Johnson knew that activating that many reserves, bringing the total American commitment to nearly three quarters of a million soldiers was not politically tenable.

The North Vietnamese sensed the crumbling of American resolve. They knew that the longer the war raged, the more antiwar sentiment in America would grow. They gambled that the American people would demand troop withdrawals before the military met its objectives.

For the next five years they pretended to negotiate with United States, making proposals they knew would be rejected. With each passing day, the number of "hawks" in America decreased. Only a small percentage of Americans objected to the war on moral grounds, but a growing majority saw the war as an effort whose price of victory was way too high.

'''


==== The Antiwar Movement


Of all the lessons learned from Vietnam, one rings louder than all the rest — it is impossible to win a long, protracted war without popular support.

When the war in Vietnam began, many Americans believed that defending South Vietnam from communist aggression was in the national interest. Communism was threatening free governments across the globe. Any sign of non-intervention from the United States might encourage revolutions elsewhere.

As the war dragged on, more and more Americans grew weary of mounting casualties and escalating costs. The small antiwar movement grew into an unstoppable force, pressuring American leaders to reconsider its commitment.

PEACE MOVEMENT leaders opposed the war on moral and economic grounds. The North Vietnamese, they argued, were fighting a patriotic war to rid themselves of foreign aggressors. Innocent Vietnamese peasants were being killed in the crossfire. American planes wrought environmental damage by dropping their defoliating chemicals.

Ho Chi Minh was the most popular leader in all of Vietnam, and the United States was supporting an undemocratic, corrupt military regime. Young American soldiers were suffering and dying. Their economic arguments were less complex, but as critical of the war effort. Military spending simply took money away from Great Society social programs such as welfare, housing, and urban renewal.

The Draft

The draft was another major source of resentment among college students. The age of the average American soldier serving in Vietnam was 19, seven years younger than its World War II counterpart. Students observed that young Americans were legally old enough to fight and die, but were not permitted to vote or drink alcohol. Such criticism led to the 26TH AMENDMENT, which granted suffrage to 18-year-olds.



Because DRAFT DEFERMENTS were granted to college students, the less affluent and less educated made up a disproportionate percentage of combat troops. Once drafted, Americans with higher levels of education were often given military office jobs. About 80 percent of American ground troops in Vietnam came from the lower classes. Latino and African American males were assigned to combat more regularly than drafted white Americans.

Antiwar demonstrations were few at first, with active participants numbering in the low thousands when Congress passed the TONKIN GULF RESOLUTION. Events in Southeast Asia and at home caused those numbers to grow as the years passed. As the Johnson Administration escalated the commitment, the peace movement grew. Television changed many minds. Millions of Americans watched body bags leave the Asian rice paddies every night in their living rooms.


Give Peace a Chance

The late 1960s became increasingly radical as the activists felt their demands were ignored. Peaceful demonstrations turned violent. When the police arrived to arrest protesters, the crowds often retaliated. Students occupied buildings across college campuses forcing many schools to cancel classes. Roads were blocked and ROTC buildings were burned. Doves clashed with police and the National Guard in August 1968, when antiwar demonstrators flocked to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to prevent the nomination of a prowar candidate.



Despite the growing antiwar movement, a silent majority of Americans still supported the Vietnam effort. Many admitted that involvement was a mistake, but military defeat was unthinkable.

When Richard Nixon was inaugurated in January 1969, the nation was bitterly divided over what course of action to follow next.

==== Years of Withdrawal


President Nixon had a plan to end American involvement in Vietnam.

By the time he entered the White House in 1969, he knew the American war effort was failing. Greater military power may have brought a favorable outcome, but there were no guarantees. And the American people were less and less willing to support any sort of escalation with each passing day.

Immediate American withdrawal would amount to a defeat of the noncommunist South Vietnamese allies. Nixon announced a plan later known as VIETNAMIZATION. The United States would gradually withdraw troops from Southeast Asia as American military personnel turned more and more of the fighting over to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. In theory, as the South Vietnamese became more able to defend themselves, United States soldiers could go home without a communist takeover of Saigon.

Troop withdrawals did little to placate the antiwar movement. Demonstrators wanted an immediate and complete departure. Events in Vietnam and at home gave greater strength to the protesters.

In the spring of 1970, President Nixon announced a temporary invasion of neighboring Cambodia. Although Cambodia was technically neutral, the Ho Chi Minh trail stretched through its territory. Nixon ordered the Viet Cong bases located along the trail to be bombed.

Kent State and MY LAI MASSACRES

Peace advocates were enraged. They claimed that Nixon was expanding the war, not reducing it as promised. Protests were mounted across America.

At KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, students rioted in protest. The burned down the ROTC building located on campus, and destroyed local property. The governor of Ohio sent the National Guard to maintain order. A state of high tension and confusion hung between the Guard and the students. Several soldiers fired their rifles, leading to deaths of four students and the wounding of several others. This became known as the Kent State massacre.


The following year the American public learned about the My Lai massacre. In 1968, American soldiers opened fire on several hundred women and children in the tiny hamlet of My Lai. How could this happen? It was not unusual for Viet Cong guerilla activity to be initiated from small villages. Further, U.S. troops were tired, scared, and confused.

At first the Lieutenant who had given the order, WILLIAM L. CALLEY, JR., was declared guilty of murder, but the ruling was later overturned. Moral outrage swept through the antiwar movement. They cited My Lai as an example of how American soldiers were killing innocent peasants.

The Pentagon Papers

In 1971, the New York Times published excerpts from the PENTAGON PAPERS, a top-secret overview of the history of government involvement in Vietnam. A participant in the study named DANIEL ELLSBERG believed the American public needed to know some of the secrets, so he leaked information to the press. The Pentagon Papers revealed a high-level deception of the American public by the Johnson Administration.

Evacuation of Saigon

The North Vietnamese Army captured Saigon in April, 1975, and renamed the capital Ho Chi Minh City. It was at this time that the last remaining American personnel in Vietnam were forced to flee.

Many statements released about the military situation in Vietnam were simply untrue, including the possibility that even the bombing of American naval boats in the Gulf of Tonkin might never have happened. A growing credibility gap between the truth and what the government said was true caused many Americans to grow even more cynical about the war.

By December 1972, Nixon decided to escalate the bombing of North Vietnamese cities, including Hanoi. He hoped this initiative would push North Vietnam to the peace table. In January 1973, a ceasefire was reached, and the remaining American combat troops were withdrawn. Nixon called the agreement "peace with honor," but he knew the South Vietnamese Army would have difficulty maintaining control.

The North soon attacked the South and in April 1975 they captured Saigon. Vietnam was united into one communist nation. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. Cambodia and Laos soon followed with communist regimes of their own. The United States was finally out of Vietnam. But every single one of its political objectives for the region met with failure.

Over 55,000 Americans perished fighting the Vietnam War.
