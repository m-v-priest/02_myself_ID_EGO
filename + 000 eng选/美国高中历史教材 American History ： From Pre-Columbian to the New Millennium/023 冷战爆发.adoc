=== Postwar Challenges  战后挑战


When he became President upon Franklin D. Roosevelt's death in 1945, few believed in Harry Truman's ability to govern. But it was Truman's common sense approach that helped the U.S. end World War II and move on to tackle postwar challenges.
*1945 年富兰克林·罗斯福去世后就任总统时，很少有人相信哈里·杜鲁门的执政能力。但正是杜鲁门的常识性做法, 帮助美国结束了第二次世界大战, 并继续应对战后挑战。*


For its part, the United States was unwilling to sit idle while another form of totalitarianism spread westward from Moscow. One war immediately begat another — the COLD WAR.
就美国而言，当另一种形式的极权主义, 从莫斯科向西蔓延时，美国也不愿意袖手旁观。一场战争立即引发了另一场战争——冷战。

No theater of the globe was free from Cold War struggle. From Eastern Europe to China and Korea, the Truman Administration was beset with the challenge of halting the advance of communism. As the wave of decolonization washed through the southern part of the globe, each new nation would be courted by the superpowers. The INDEPENDENCE OF ISRAEL IN 1948 had Cold War implications in the Middle East. Within five years of the end of World War II, American troops were summoned to South Korea to halt the advancing communist forces of the North.
世界上没有一个地区不受到冷战影响。从东欧到中国和韩国，杜鲁门政府面临着阻止共产主义前进的挑战。随着非殖民化浪潮席卷全球南部，每个新国家都会受到超级大国的青睐。 1948 年以色列独立对中东产生了冷战影响。*第二次世界大战结束后的五年内，美国军队被召集到韩国, 阻止朝鲜共产党军队的前进。*



No single foreign policy issue mattered more to the United States for the next 50 years as much as the Cold War. President Truman set the direction for the next eight presidents with the announcement of the containment policy. Crises in Berlin, China, and Korea forced Truman to back his words with actions. The Cold War kept defense industries humming and ultimately proved the limits of American power in Vietnam. Democracy was tested with outbreaks of Communist witch hunts.
**在接下来的 50 年里，没有哪个外交政策问题, 比"冷战"对美国更重要。杜鲁门总统宣布遏制政策，为接下来的八位总统确定了方向。**柏林、中国和韩国的危机, 迫使杜鲁门用行动来兑现他的诺言。冷战使国防工业保持蓬勃发展，并最终证明了美国在越南的实力有限。民主政治因共产主义政治迫害的爆发, 而受到考验。

Although the United States would emerge triumphant in the Cold War, the last half of the 1940s was marked by an uncertainty that soured the sweet taste of victory in World War II.
尽管美国在冷战中取得了胜利，但 20 世纪 40 年代后半叶的不确定性, 却让二战胜利的甜蜜滋味变酸。

==== The Cold War Erupts 冷战爆发


In 1945, one major war ended and another began.
1945年，一场大战结束，另一场战争开始。

The Cold War lasted about 45 years. There were no direct military campaigns between the two main antagonists, the United States and the Soviet Union. Yet billions of dollars and millions of lives were lost in the fight.
**冷战持续了大约45年。**美国和苏联这两个主要对手之间没有发生直接的军事行动。然而，数十亿美元和数百万人, 在这场战斗中丧生。


Winston Churchill's 1946 speech to Westminster University in Missouri contained the first reference to the communism of Eastern Europe as an "iron curtain."
温斯顿·丘吉尔 1946 年在密苏里州威斯敏斯特大学的演讲中, 首次将东欧共产主义称为“铁幕”。

image:/img/iron curtain 1.webp[,30%]
image:/img/iron curtain 2.jpg[,30%]



The long-term causes of the Cold War are clear. Western democracies had always been hostile to the idea of a communist state. The United States had refused recognition to the USSR for 16 years after the Bolshevik takeover. Domestic fears of communism erupted in a RED SCARE in America in the early Twenties. American business leaders had long feared the consequences of a politically driven workers' organization. World War II provided short-term causes as well.
冷战的长期原因是显而易见的。西方民主国家一直敌视共产主义国家的想法。布尔什维克接管苏联后，美国长达 16 年拒绝承认苏联。二十世纪二十年代初期，美国国内对共产主义的恐惧爆发了一场红色恐慌。**美国商界领袖长期以来一直担心政治驱动的工人组织的后果。**第二次世界大战也提供了短期原因。

There was hostility on the Soviet side as well. Twenty million Russian citizens perished during World War II. Stalin was enraged that the Americans and British had waited so long to open a front in France. This would have relieved pressure on the Soviet Union from the attacking Germans. Further, The United States terminated Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union before the war was complete. Finally, the Soviet Union believed in communism.
苏联方面也存在敌意。第二次世界大战期间，两千万俄罗斯公民丧生。斯大林对美国和英国等了这么久才在法国开辟战线感到愤怒。这将减轻德国人进攻对苏联的压力。此外，美国在战争结束前, 终止了对苏联的租借援助。最后，苏联信仰了"共产主义"。

Stalin made promises during the war about the freedom of eastern Europe on which he blatantly reneged. At the YALTA CONFERENCE, the USSR pledged to enter the war against Japan no later than three months after the conclusion of the European war. In return, the United States awarded the Soviets territorial concessions from Japan and special rights in Chinese Manchuria.
斯大林在战争期间, 做出了关于东欧自由的承诺，但他公然违背了这一承诺。在雅尔塔会议上，苏联承诺在欧洲战争结束后三个月内, 加入对日战争。作为回报，美国向苏联授予日本的领土让步, 和在中国满洲的特殊权利。






When the Soviet Union entered the war between the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States no longer needed their aid, but Stalin was there to collect on Western promises. All these factors contributed to a climate of mistrust that heightened tensions at the outbreak of the Cold War.
当苏联加入广岛和长崎原子弹爆炸之间的战争时，美国不再需要他们的援助，但斯大林在那里收取西方的承诺。所有这些因素都造成了不信任的气氛，加剧了冷战爆发时的紧张局势。

The cold-war world in 1950
For most of the second half of the 20th century, the USSR and the United States were engaged in a Cold War of economic and diplomatic struggles. The communist bloc, as it appeared in 1950, included countries to the west and southeast of the Soviet Union.
在20世纪下半叶的大部分时间里，苏联和美国都处于经济和外交斗争的冷战之中。 1950 年出现的"共产主义集团"包括苏联西部和东南部的国家。

At Potsdam, the Allies agreed on the postwar outcome for Nazi Germany. After territorial adjustments, Germany was divided into four OCCUPATION ZONES with the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union each administering one. Germany was to be democratized and de-Nazified. Once the Nazi leaders were arrested and war crimes trials began, a date would be agreed upon for the election of a new German government and the withdrawal of Allied troops.
在波茨坦，盟军就纳粹德国的战后结果达成一致。领土调整后，*德国被划分为四个占领区，美国、英国、法国、苏联各管辖一个。德国将实现民主化和去纳粹化。一旦纳粹领导人被捕并开始战争罪审判，德国新政府选举, 和盟军撤军的日期, 就会商定。*

This process was executed in the zones held by the western Allies. In the eastern Soviet occupation zone, a puppet communist regime was elected. There was no promise of repatriation with the west. Soon such governments, aided by the Soviet Red Army came to power all across eastern Europe. Stalin was determined to create a buffer zone to prevent any future invasion of the Russian heartland.
**这一过程是在西方盟军控制的地区进行的。在东部苏联占领区，选举产生了共产主义傀儡政权。西方国家没有做出遣返的承诺。**很快，这些政府在苏联红军的帮助下, 在东欧各地上台执政。斯大林决心建立一个缓冲区，以防止未来对俄罗斯腹地的任何入侵。

Winston Churchill remarked in 1946 that an "iron curtain had descended across the continent."
1946 年，温斯顿·丘吉尔 (Winston Churchill) 评论道，“铁幕已经降临整个大陆”。

==== The United Nations 联合国


The Allies had won the war, but would they be able to keep the peace?
盟军赢得了战争，但他们能维持和平吗？

An examination of the period between WWI and WWII showed a lack of commitment to the spirit of internationalism. The old League of Nations proved too weak in structure to fill this void. Perhaps a stronger international body, as envisioned by Woodrow Wilson, was necessary to keep the world powers from tearing each other apart. It was in this spirit that Franklin Roosevelt championed the creation of a United Nations.
*对一战和二战期间的考察表明，缺乏对国际主义精神的承诺。事实证明，旧的"国际联盟"在结构上过于薄弱，无法填补这一空白(即国际联盟无法实现这一目标)。也许正如伍德罗·威尔逊所设想的那样，有必要建立一个更强大的国际机构，以防止世界大国相互分裂。正是本着这种精神，富兰克林·罗斯福倡导创建"联合国"。*

The BIG THREE of Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin had devoted hours of dialogue to the nature of a United Nations. After agreeing on the general principles at the DUMBARTON OAKS and Yalta Conferences, delegates from around the world met in San Francisco to write a charter. With the nation still mourning the recent death of Franklin Roosevelt, his wife Eleanor addressed the delegates. Despite considerable enmity and conflicts of interest among the attending nations, a charter was ultimately approved by unanimous consent.
丘吉尔、罗斯福和斯大林三巨头, 就"联合国"的性质进行了数小时的对话。在敦巴顿橡树园会议, 和雅尔塔会议, 就"一般原则"达成一致后，来自世界各地的代表在旧金山齐聚一堂，起草了一份章程。当全国仍在哀悼富兰克林·罗斯福最近去世时，他的妻子埃莉诺向代表们发表了讲话。尽管与会国家之间存在相当大的敌意, 和利益冲突，但宪章最终获得一致同意并通过。

Despite the ideological animosity spawned by the Cold War, a new spirit of globalism was born after WWII. It was based, in part, on the widespread recognition of the failures of isolationism. The incarnation of this global sprit came to life with the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 with its headquarters in New York City.
**尽管冷战催生了意识形态上的敌意，但二战后一种新的"全球主义精神"诞生了。它部分基于对"孤立主义"失败的广泛认识。**随着 1945 年总部设在纽约市的联合国的成立，这种全球精神得到了体现。

How does the UN work?
联合国如何运作？

The UN charter called for the establishment of a Security Council, or "upper house." The SECURITY COUNCIL serves as the executive branch of the United Nations. The Security Council must authorize any actions, such as economic sanctions, the use of force, or the deployment of peacekeeping troops.
*联合国宪章要求设立"安理会"，即“上议院”。*"安全理事会"是联合国的执行机构。*任何行动都必须得到"安理会"的授权，例如经济制裁、使用武力或部署维和部队。*

Each of the "GREAT POWERS" — the United States, Great Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union — holds a permanent seat on the Security Council. The remaining ten seats are elected to two-year terms by the General Assembly. Each permanent member holds the power of veto. No action can go forth if any one of the five objects. As the Cold War crystallized, the countervailing veto powers of the United States and the Soviet Union served often to inhibit the Security Council from taking any forceful or meaningful action.
美国、英国、法国、中国和苏联等“大国”, 都在安理会拥有"常任理事国"席位。其余十个席位由大会选举产生，任期两年。**每个"常任理事国"都拥有否决权。**如果有五个对象中的任何一个反对，则无法进行任何操作。随着冷战的具体化，美国和苏联的否决权, 常常抑制"安理会"采取任何有力或有意义的行动。

The main body of the United Nations is called the GENERAL ASSEMBLY. Every member nation holds a seat in the General Assembly, which is often described as a town meeting for the world. The General Assembly has standing committees to address ongoing issues such as economics and finance, social, cultural and humanitarian concerns, and legal problems. The General Assembly passes resolutions and has the power to make recommendations to the Security Council, but has no power to require any action. In addition to the General Assembly, and ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL has committees designed to address a wide array of topics from the STATUS OF WOMEN to the ENVIRONMENT.
**联合国的主要机构称为"大会"。每个成员国都在大会中占有一席之地，这通常被描述为世界的城镇会议。**大会设有常设委员会, 来解决经济和金融、社会、文化和人道主义问题, 以及法律问题等持续存在的问题。**"大会"通过决议, 并有权向"安理会"提出建议，但无权要求采取任何行动。**除"大会"外，"经济及社会理事会"还设有"委员会"，旨在解决从妇女地位到环境等一系列广泛主题。


A TRUSTEESHIP COUNCIL was designed to oversee the transition of states from colonies to independent nations.
"托管委员会", 旨在监督国家从"殖民地"向"独立国家"的过渡。

The Secretariat manages the day-to-day operations of the United Nations. An INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE was also created.
"秘书处"管理联合国的日常运作。"国际法院"也成立了。

The UN can point to many solid accomplishments. Among them: sending peacekeepers to war-stricken areas, making recommendations on how to raise literacy and health rates in the Third World, and even authorizing the use of force against aggressor nations.
联合国可以指出许多扎实的成就。其中：向战乱地区派遣维和人员，就"如何提高第三世界的识字率和健康率提"出建议，甚至授权对侵略国使用武力。

In 1945 as well as today the UN gives cause for believe that nations can get along together. In a world with conflicting histories, agendas, and political posturing, one international group — the United Nations — remains above the day-to-day fray.
无论是 1945 年还是今天，联合国都有理由相信各国可以和睦相处。*在一个历史、议程和政治姿态相互冲突的世界中，一个国际组织——联合国——仍然置身于日常冲突之外。*

When the Cold War ended in the 1990s, many citizens around the globe once again looked to the United Nations with renewed hope of building a safer, stronger planet.
20 世纪 90 年代冷战结束后，全球许多公民再次寄望于"联合国"，重新燃起建设一个更安全、更强大的地球的希望。

==== Containment and the Marshall Plan 遏制和马歇尔计划


Communism was on the march.
共产主义正在前进。

When the RED ARMY marched on Germany, it quickly absorbed the nearby nations ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA into the Soviet Union. Soon communist forces dominated the governments of ROMANIA and BULGARIA. By the fall of 1945, it was clear that the Soviet-backed LUBLIN REGIME had complete control of Poland, violating the Yalta promise of free and unfettered elections there. It was only a matter of time before Hungary and Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet orbit. Yugoslavia had an independent communist leader named TITO.
当红军进军德国时，它很快将附近的国家"爱沙尼亚"、"拉脱维亚", 和"立陶宛", 并入苏联。很快，共产主义势力统治了"罗马尼亚"和"保加利亚"政府。到 1945 年秋天，**苏联支持的卢布林政权, 显然已经完全控制了"波兰"，这违反了雅尔塔关于在那里举行"自由和不受约束的选举"的承诺。**"匈牙利"和"捷克斯洛伐克", 落入苏联轨道, 也只是时间问题。"南斯拉夫"有一位独立的共产主义领导人，名叫铁托。

And now Stalin was ordering the creation of a communist PUPPET REGIME in the Soviet sector of occupied Germany. How many dominoes would fall? United States diplomats saw a continent ravaged by war looking for strong leadership and aid of any sort, providing a climate ripe for revolution. Would the Soviets get all of Germany? Or Italy and France? President Truman was determined to reverse this trend.
现在斯大林下令, 在被占领的德国的苏联地区, 建立一个共产主义傀儡政权。会有多少多米诺骨牌倒下？美国外交官看到一个饱受战争蹂躏的(欧洲)大陆, 正在寻求强有力的领导和任何形式的援助，为革命提供了成熟的气候。*苏联会得到整个德国吗？还是意大利和法国？杜鲁门总统决心扭转这一趋势。*



Greece and Turkey were the first nations spiraling into crisis that had not been directly occupied by the Soviet Army. Both countries were on the verge of being taken over by Soviet-backed guerrilla movements. Truman decided to draw a line in the sand. In March 1947, he asked Congress to appropriate $400 million to send to these two nations in the form of military and economic assistance. Within two years the communist threat had passed, and both nations were comfortably in the western sphere of influence.
**希腊和土耳其, 是最先陷入危机, 但未被苏联军队直接占领的国家。这两个国家都处于被苏联支持的游击运动接管的边缘。杜鲁门决定划清界限。 1947 年 3 月，他要求国会拨款 4 亿美元，以军事和经济援助的形式, 向这两个国家提供援助。两年之内，共产主义威胁就过去了，两国都轻松地处于西方势力范围内。**

A mid-level diplomat in the State Department named GEORGE KENNAN proposed the POLICY OF CONTAINMENT. Since the American people were weary from war and had no desire to send United States troops into Eastern Europe, rolling back the gains of the Red Army would have been impossible.
国务院一位名叫乔治·凯南的中层外交官, 提出了遏制政策。由于美国人民已经厌倦了战争，不愿意派遣美国军队进入东欧，想要扭转苏联红军的战果是不可能的。

Marshall Plan poster

In July 1947 a majority of the American public had never even heard of the Marshall Plan. But to win passage in Congress, the Truman administration needed strong public support, so it launched a massive public relations campaign.
1947 年 7 月，大多数美国公众甚至从未听说过马歇尔计划。但为了赢得国会通过，杜鲁门政府需要强有力的公众支持，因此发起了大规模的公关活动。

But in places where communism threatened to expand, American aid might prevent a takeover. By vigorously pursuing this policy, the United States might be able to contain communism within its current borders. The policy became known as the TRUMAN DOCTRINE, as the President outlined these intentions with his request for monetary aid for Greece and Turkey.
但在共产主义有扩张威胁的地方，美国的援助, 可能会阻止共产主义的接管。通过大力推行这一政策，美国或许能够将"共产主义"遏制在其现有境内。该政策被称为"杜鲁门主义"，因为总统在向希腊和土耳其提供货币援助的请求中, 概述了这些意图。

.Truman Doctrine 杜鲁门主义
是在美国总统"杜鲁门"任期内形成的美国对外政策，**成为第二次世界大战后美国的对外政策核心。**

Harry S. Truman 哈里·S·杜鲁门 +
image:/img/Harry S. Truman 2.webp[,30%]
image:/img/Harry S. Truman.jpg[,30%]


希腊内战期间，杜鲁门于1947年3月12日发表《国情咨文》，主张：“自由人民正在抵抗少数武装份子或外来势力征服之意图，美国政策必须支持他们。”杜鲁门认为，极权主义裹挟自由人民，形成对于国际和平与美国国家安全的威胁。他因此要求国会为援助土耳其和希腊政府，拨款4亿美元，防止当地落入共产党手中。一般认为，这是杜鲁门主义正式形成的起点。

历史学家埃里克·福纳认为，*杜鲁门主义“成为美国在世界各地援助反共政权（无论其多不民主）的先例，并建立一套针对苏联的全球军事联盟。”*

**美国为了防止"共产主义"在世界任何地方出现, 并协助欧洲国家偿还美国贷款, 与协助美国公司战后的成长，因此实行“马歇尔计划”，援助西欧国家，解救他们战后的贫困，以防止发生革命。**

美国也大力发展军备，仅在1948年一年内就将核武器的储备从13枚扩展到50多枚。因此**杜鲁门主义也是冷战的开始，彻底改变了罗斯福时代的美国对外政策，奠定了战后世界的基本格局。**

In the aftermath of WWII, Western Europe lay devastated. The war had ruined crop fields and destroyed infrastructure, leaving most of Europe in dire need. On June 5, 1947, Secretary of State GEORGE MARSHALL announced the European Recovery Program. To avoid antagonizing the Soviet Union, Marshall announced that the purpose of sending aid to Western Europe was completely humanitarian, and even offered aid to the communist states in the east. Congress approved Truman's request of $17 billion over four years to be sent to Great Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium.
二战结束后，西欧满目疮痍。战争毁坏了农田, 并摧毁了基础设施，使欧洲大部分地区陷入困境。** 1947 年 6 月 5 日，国务卿乔治·马歇尔宣布了欧洲复兴计划。为了避免与苏联对抗，马歇尔宣布向西欧提供援助的目的完全是人道主义，**甚至向东部的共产主义国家提供了援助。国会批准了杜鲁门的请求，在四年内向英国、法国、西德、意大利、荷兰和比利时提供 170 亿美元的资金。



The MARSHALL PLAN created an economic miracle in Western Europe. By the target date of the program four years later, Western European industries were producing twice as much as they had been the year before war broke out. Some Americans grumbled about the costs, but the nation spent more on liquor during the years of the Marshall Plan than they sent overseas to Europe. The aid also produced record levels of trade with American firms, fueling a postwar economic boom in the United States.
**马歇尔计划创造了西欧的经济奇迹。**到四年后该计划的目标日期，西欧工业的产量, 是战争爆发前一年的两倍。一些美国人对成本抱怨不已，但在马歇尔计划期间，美国在酒类上的花费比销往欧洲的还要多。*这些援助还使与美国企业的贸易达到了创纪录的水平，推动了美国战后的经济繁荣。*

Lastly and much to Truman's delight, none of these nations of western Europe faced a serious threat of communist takeover for the duration of the Cold War.
最后，令杜鲁门高兴的是，冷战期间这些西欧国家, 都没有面临共产主义接管的严重威胁。

==== The Berlin Airlift and NATO 柏林空运和北约


BERLIN, Germany's wartime capital was the prickliest of all issues that separated the United States and Soviet Union during the late 1940s. The city was divided into four ZONES OF OCCUPATION like the rest of Germany. However, the entire city lay within the Soviet zone of occupation. Once the nation of EAST GERMANY was established, the Allied sections of the capital known as West Berlin became an island of democracy and capitalism behind the IRON CURTAIN.
**柏林**是德国战时首都，是 20 世纪 40 年代末, 美国和苏联分裂的所有问题中最棘手的。与德国其他地区一样，这座城市分为四个占领区。然而，**整个城市都位于苏联占领区内。**东德国家成立后，首都西柏林的盟军部分, 就成为铁幕背后的民主和资本主义岛屿。

In June 1948, tensions within Berlin touched off a crisis.
1948 年 6 月，柏林内部的紧张局势, 引发了一场危机。

The Soviets decided to seal all land routes going into West Berlin. Stalin gambled that the Western powers were not willing to risk another war to protect half of Berlin. The Allies were tired, and their populations were unlikely to support a new war. A withdrawal by the United States would eliminate this democratic enclave in the Soviet zone.
**苏联决定封锁所有进入西柏林的陆路。斯大林赌西方列强不愿意冒另一场战争的风险来保护半个柏林。**盟军已经疲惫不堪，他们的人民也不太可能支持新的战争。美国的撤军, 将消除苏联地区的这片民主飞地。

Truman was faced with tough choices. Relinquishing Berlin to the Soviets would seriously undermine the new doctrine of containment. Any negotiated settlement would suggest that the USSR could engineer a crisis at any time to exact concessions. If Berlin were compromised, the whole of West Germany might question the American commitment to German democracy. To Harry Truman, there was no question. "We are going to stay, period, " he declared. Together, with Britain, the United States began moving massive amounts of food and supplies into West Berlin by the only path still open — the air.
杜鲁门面临着艰难的选择。将柏林交给苏联, 将严重破坏新的"遏制理论"。任何谈判解决方案, 都表明苏联可以随时制造危机, 以迫使其让步。**如果柏林受到损害，整个西德可能会质疑美国对德国民主的承诺。**对于哈里·杜鲁门来说，这是毫无疑问的。 “我们会留下来，就这样，”他宣称。美国与英国将一起, 开始通过唯一的仍然开放的道路——空中, 来运输大量食品和物资, 进入西柏林。


Berlin Airlift map
Flying from occupied Germany and landing a supply plane in Berlin at the rate of one every 3 minutes, the Berlin Airlift managed to supply the city with the materials needed for survival.
柏林空运, 从被占领的德国起飞，以每 3 分钟一架的速度降落在柏林，成功为这座城市提供了生存所需的物资。

Truman had thrown the gauntlet at Stalin's feet. The USSR had to now choose between war and peace. He refused to give the order to shoot down the American planes. Over the next eleven months, British and American planes flew over 4000 tons of supplies daily into West Berlin. As the American public cheered "OPERATION VITTLES," Stalin began to look bad in the eyes of the world. He was clearly willing to use innocent civilians as pawns to quench his expansionist thirst. In May 1949, the Soviets ended the blockade. The United States and Britain had flown over 250,000-supply missions.
杜鲁门已向斯大林发出了挑战。**苏联现在必须在战争与和平之间做出选择。他拒绝下令击落美国飞机。**在接下来的 11 个月里，英国和美国的飞机每天向西柏林运送超过 4000 吨物资。当美国公众为“维特尔斯行动”欢呼时，**斯大林开始在世人眼中变得不好起来。**他显然愿意利用无辜平民作为棋子, 来满足其扩张主义的渴望。 **1949年5月，苏联结束了封锁。**美国和英国已执行超过 25 万次补给任务。

Stalin miscalculated when he estimated the strength of western unity. To cement the cooperation that the western allies had shown during the war and immediate postwar years, the NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION was created in April 1949. The pact operated on the basis of collective security. If any one of the member states were attacked, all would retaliate together. The original NATO included Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Iceland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, and the United States.
斯大林在估计西方团结的力量时失算了。**为了巩固西方盟国在战争期间和战后几年所表现出的合作，"北大西洋公约组织"于 1949 年 4 月成立。该条约在集体安全的基础上运作。如果任何一个成员国受到攻击，所有成员国都会联合起来进行报复。**最初的北约包括英国、法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时、加拿大、冰岛、卢森堡、丹麦、挪威、葡萄牙和美国。

==== The Korean War 朝鲜战争


Containment had not gone so well in Asia. When the Soviet Union entered the war against Japan, they sent troops into Japanese-occupied Korea. As American troops established a presence in the southern part of the Korean peninsula, the Soviets began cutting roads and communications at the 38TH PARALLEL. Two separate governments were emerging, as Korea began to resemble the divided Germany.
在亚洲的遏制措施, 进展得不太顺利。当苏联对日本发动战争时，他们派兵进入日本占领的朝鲜。当美国军队在朝鲜半岛南部建立存在时，苏联开始切断北纬 38 度线的道路和通讯。随着韩国开始类似于分裂的德国，两个独立的政府正在出现。

Upon the recommendation of the UN, elections were scheduled, but the North refused to participate. The South elected SYNGMAN RHEE as president, but the Soviet-backed North was ruled by KIM IL SUNG. When the United States withdrew its forces from the peninsula, trouble began.
**根据联合国的建议，安排了选举，但朝鲜拒绝参加。韩国选举李承晚为总统，**但苏联支持的朝鲜则由金日成统治。当美国从半岛撤军时，麻烦就开始了。

Northern Korean armed forces crossed the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950. It took only two days for President Truman to commit the United States military to the defense of southern Korea. Truman hoped to build a broad coalition against the aggressors from the North by enlisting support from the United Nations.
1950 年 6 月 25 日，朝鲜武装部队越过了北纬 38 度线。杜鲁门总统只用了两天时间就让美国军队保卫朝鲜南部。*杜鲁门希望通过争取"联合国"的支持，建立一个广泛的联盟来对抗北方的侵略者。*

North Korean Tanks Cross 38th Parallel

Of course, the Soviet Union could veto any proposed action by the Security Council, but this time, the Americans were in luck. The Soviets were boycotting the Security Council for refusing to admit RED CHINA into the United Nations. As a result, the Council voted unanimously to "repel the armed attack" of North Korea. Many countries sent troops to defend the South, but forces beyond those of the United States and South Korea were nominal.
**当然，苏联可以否决"安理会"提出的任何行动建议，但这一次，美国人很幸运。苏联人抵制"安理会"，因为安理会拒绝接纳红色中国加入联合国。结果，安理会一致投票“击退”朝鲜的武装进攻。**许多国家派兵保卫南方，但美国和韩国之外的力量只是名义上的。

The commander of the UN forces was none other than Douglas MacArthur. He had an uphill battle to fight, as the North had overrun the entire peninsula with the exception of the small PUSAN PERIMETER in the South. MacArthur ordered an amphibious assault at Inchon on the western side of the peninsula on September 15.
**联合国部队的指挥官不是别人，正是道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟。**他有一场艰苦的战斗要打，因为北方已经占领了整个半岛，除了南方的小釜山周边地区。 9月15日，麦克阿瑟下令对半岛西侧的"仁川"发动两栖攻击。

Caught by surprise, the communist-backed northern forces reeled in retreat. American led-forces from INCHON and the Pusan Perimeter quickly pushed the northern troops to the 38th Parallel — and kept going. The United States saw an opportunity to create a complete indivisible democratic Korea and pushed the northern army up to the Yalu River, which borders China.
共产党支持的北方军队措手不及，纷纷撤退。来自"仁川"和"釜山"周界的美国主力, 迅速将北方部队推至北纬 38 度线，并继续前进。美国看到了建立一个完全不可分割的民主朝鲜的机会，并将北方军队推至与中国接壤的鸭绿江边。


With anticommunism on the rise at home, Truman relished the idea of reuniting Korea. His hopes were dashed on November 27, when over 400,000 Chinese soldiers flooded across the YALU RIVER. In 1949, Mao Tse-tung had established a communist dictatorship in China, the world's most populous nation. The Chinese now sought to aide the communists in northern Korea.
随着国内反共情绪高涨，杜鲁门对朝鲜半岛重新统一的想法很感兴趣。 11月27日，超过40万中国士兵涌入鸭绿江，他的希望破灭了。 1949年，毛泽东在中国这个世界上人口最多的国家建立了共产主义专政。中国人现在寻求援助朝鲜的共产党人。

In no time, American troops were once again forced below the 38th Parallel. General MacArthur wanted to escalate the war. He sought to bomb the Chinese mainland and blockade their coast.
很快，美军再次被迫撤退至北纬 38 度线以下。*麦克阿瑟将军想要使战争升级。他试图轰炸中国大陆并封锁他们的海岸。*

Truman disagreed. He feared escalation of the conflict could lead to World War III, especially if the now nuclear-armed Soviet Union lent assistance to China. Disgruntled, MacArthur took his case directly to the American people by openly criticizing Truman's approach. Truman promptly fired him for insubordination.
*杜鲁门不同意。他担心冲突升级可能导致第三次世界大战，特别是如果现在拥有核武器的苏联向中国提供援助的话。麦克阿瑟心怀不满，通过公开批评杜鲁门的做法，将自己的案子直接告诉美国人民。杜鲁门立即以不服从命令为由解雇了他。*

Meanwhile, the war evolved into a stalemate, with the front line corresponding more or less to the 38th Parallel. Ceasefire negotiations dragged on for two more years, beyond Truman's Presidency. Finally, on July 27, 1953, an armistice was signed at PANMUNJOM. North Korea remained a communist dictatorship, and South Korea remained under the control of Syngman Rhee, a military strong man. Over 37,000 Americans were killed in the conflict.
与此同时，战争陷入胶着状态，战线大致对应于北纬38度线。**停火谈判又拖延了两年，直到杜鲁门总统任期结束。**最终，1953年7月27日，停战协定在"板门店"签署。朝鲜仍然是共产主义独裁国家，韩国仍然处于军事强人李承晚的控制之下。*超过 37,000 名美国人在韩战冲突中丧生。*

Note: For decades after the war, the accepted figure for American Korean War deaths was 54,246. In 1993, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement clarifying that this figure represented all deaths of U.S. military personel worldwide during the war, and not only casualties of the war. The DoD stated that 17,730 deaths during this period were not related to the war in Korea
注：**战后数十年，公认的美国朝鲜战争死亡人数为 54,246 人。** 1993年，战争结束50周年，美国国防部发表声明澄清，*这一数字代表了战争期间全世界所有美军人员的死亡，而不仅仅是战争的伤亡人数。国防部表示，在此期间有 17,730 人死亡与朝鲜战争无关*

==== Domestic Challenges 国内挑战

The sign on Harry Truman's desk read "THE BUCK STOPS HERE." By buck, he meant responsibility, and the bucks ran amuck on his desk.
哈里·杜鲁门办公桌上的牌子上写着“责任止于此”。他所说的“钱”意味着责任，而钱却在他的办公桌上横行。

The end of World War II brought a series of challenges to Harry Truman. The entire economy had to be converted from a wartime economy to a consumer economy. Strikes that had been delayed during the war erupted with a frenzy across America. Inflation threatened as millions of Americans planned to spend wealth they had not enjoyed since 1929. As the soldiers returned home, they wanted their old jobs back, creating a huge labor surplus. Truman, distracted by new threats overseas, was faced with additional crises at home.
**第二次世界大战的结束, 给哈里·杜鲁门带来了一系列挑战。整个经济必须从"战时经济"转变为"消费经济"。战争期间被推迟的罢工, 在美国各地疯狂爆发。**由于数以百万计的美国人计划花掉他们自 1929 年以来从未享受过的财富，产生了"通货膨胀"的威胁。**当士兵们返回家园时，他们希望恢复原来的工作，从而创造了巨大的劳动力剩余。**杜鲁门因海外新威胁而心烦意乱，国内也面临着更多危机。

To provide relief for the veterans of World War II, and to diminish the labor surplus, Congress passed the SERVICEMAN'S READJUSTMENT ACT OF 1944. Known as the GI BILL OF RIGHTS, this law granted government loans to veterans who wished to start a new business or build a home. It also provided money for veterans to attend school or college. Thousands took advantage, and Americans enjoyed the double bonus of relieving unemployment and investing in a more educated workforce.
**为了向二战退伍军人提供救济，并减少劳动力剩余，国会通过了 1944 年《军人重新调整法案》。这项法律被称为《退伍军人权利法案》，向希望开办新企业或希望创业的退伍军人提供政府贷款。建造一个家。它还为退伍军人提供上学或大学的资金。**成千上万的人从中受益，美国人享受到了缓解失业, 和投资于受过更多教育的劳动力的双重红利。

这项法案由"美国退伍军人协会"推动。

Although Truman maintained wartime price controls for over a year after the war, he was pressured to end them by the Republican Congress in 1947. Inflation skyrocketed and workers immediately demanded pay increases. Strikes soon spread across America involving millions of American workers.
尽管杜鲁门在战后维持了一年多的战时价格管制，但他在 1947 年受到共和党国会的压力, 而终止了这种管制。**通货膨胀飙升，工人们立即要求加薪。罢工很快蔓延到美国各地，**涉及数百万美国工人。

Congress passed the TAFT-HARTLEY ACT, which allowed the President to declare a "cooling-off" period if a strike were to erupt. Union leaders became liable for damages in lawsuits and were required to sign noncommunist oaths. The ability of unions to contribute to political campaigns was limited. Truman vetoed this measure, but it was passed by the Congress nonetheless.
国会通过了《塔夫脱-哈特利法案》，该法案允许总统在罢工爆发时宣布“冷静期”。工会领导人要对诉讼中的损害承担责任，并被要求签署"非共产主义誓言"。工会为政治运动做出贡献的能力是有限的。杜鲁门否决了这项措施，但国会还是通过了这项措施。




Serious issues remained. Now that nuclear power was a reality, who would control the fissionable materials? In August 1946, Truman signed the ATOMIC ENERGY ACT, which gave the government a monopoly over all nuclear material. Five civilians would head the ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION. They directed the peaceful uses of the atom. The President was vested with exclusive authority to launch a NUCLEAR STRIKE. The military was also reorganized.
严重的问题仍然存在。既然核能已成为现实，谁将控制裂变材料？ 1946 年 8 月，杜鲁门签署了《原子能法案》，该法案赋予政府对所有核材料的垄断权。五名文职人员将担任"原子能委员会"主席。他们指导原子的和平利用。总统被授予发动核打击的专属权力。军队也进行了重组。

The WAR DEPARTMENT was eliminated and a new DEFENSE DEPARTMENT was created. The Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were subordinate to the new Secretary of Defense. The NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL was created to coordinate the Departments of State and Defense. Finally, a CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY was established to monitor espionage activities around the globe.
"战争部"被取消，并创建了新的"国防部"。陆军、海军和空军部长, 均隶属于新任国防部长。"国家安全委员会"的成立, 是为了协调"国务院"和"国防部"。最后，成立了"中央情报局"来监视全球的间谍活动。

=== Postwar Challenges


When he became President upon Franklin D. Roosevelt's death in 1945, few believed in Harry Truman's ability to govern. But it was Truman's common sense approach that helped the U.S. end World War II and move on to tackle postwar challenges.


For its part, the United States was unwilling to sit idle while another form of totalitarianism spread westward from Moscow. One war immediately begat another — the COLD WAR.

No theater of the globe was free from Cold War struggle. From Eastern Europe to China and Korea, the Truman Administration was beset with the challenge of halting the advance of communism. As the wave of decolonization washed through the southern part of the globe, each new nation would be courted by the superpowers. The INDEPENDENCE OF ISRAEL IN 1948 had Cold War implications in the Middle East. Within five years of the end of World War II, American troops were summoned to South Korea to halt the advancing communist forces of the North.



No single foreign policy issue mattered more to the United States for the next 50 years as much as the Cold War. President Truman set the direction for the next eight presidents with the announcement of the containment policy. Crises in Berlin, China, and Korea forced Truman to back his words with actions. The Cold War kept defense industries humming and ultimately proved the limits of American power in Vietnam. Democracy was tested with outbreaks of Communist witch hunts.

Although the United States would emerge triumphant in the Cold War, the last half of the 1940s was marked by an uncertainty that soured the sweet taste of victory in World War II.


'''

==== The Cold War Erupts


In 1945, one major war ended and another began.

The Cold War lasted about 45 years. There were no direct military campaigns between the two main antagonists, the United States and the Soviet Union. Yet billions of dollars and millions of lives were lost in the fight.


Winston Churchill's 1946 speech to Westminster University in Missouri contained the first reference to the communism of Eastern Europe as an "iron curtain."


The long-term causes of the Cold War are clear. Western democracies had always been hostile to the idea of a communist state. The United States had refused recognition to the USSR for 16 years after the Bolshevik takeover. Domestic fears of communism erupted in a RED SCARE in America in the early Twenties. American business leaders had long feared the consequences of a politically driven workers' organization. World War II provided short-term causes as well.

There was hostility on the Soviet side as well. Twenty million Russian citizens perished during World War II. Stalin was enraged that the Americans and British had waited so long to open a front in France. This would have relieved pressure on the Soviet Union from the attacking Germans. Further, The United States terminated Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union before the war was complete. Finally, the Soviet Union believed in communism.

Stalin made promises during the war about the freedom of eastern Europe on which he blatantly reneged. At the YALTA CONFERENCE, the USSR pledged to enter the war against Japan no later than three months after the conclusion of the European war. In return, the United States awarded the Soviets territorial concessions from Japan and special rights in Chinese Manchuria.






When the Soviet Union entered the war between the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States no longer needed their aid, but Stalin was there to collect on Western promises. All these factors contributed to a climate of mistrust that heightened tensions at the outbreak of the Cold War.

The cold-war world in 1950

For most of the second half of the 20th century, the USSR and the United States were engaged in a Cold War of economic and diplomatic struggles. The communist bloc, as it appeared in 1950, included countries to the west and southeast of the Soviet Union.

At Potsdam, the Allies agreed on the postwar outcome for Nazi Germany. After territorial adjustments, Germany was divided into four OCCUPATION ZONES with the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union each administering one. Germany was to be democratized and de-Nazified. Once the Nazi leaders were arrested and war crimes trials began, a date would be agreed upon for the election of a new German government and the withdrawal of Allied troops.

This process was executed in the zones held by the western Allies. In the eastern Soviet occupation zone, a puppet communist regime was elected. There was no promise of repatriation with the west. Soon such governments, aided by the Soviet Red Army came to power all across eastern Europe. Stalin was determined to create a buffer zone to prevent any future invasion of the Russian heartland.

Winston Churchill remarked in 1946 that an "iron curtain had descended across the continent."

'''

==== The United Nations


The Allies had won the war, but would they be able to keep the peace?

An examination of the period between WWI and WWII showed a lack of commitment to the spirit of internationalism. The old League of Nations proved too weak in structure to fill this void. Perhaps a stronger international body, as envisioned by Woodrow Wilson, was necessary to keep the world powers from tearing each other apart. It was in this spirit that Franklin Roosevelt championed the creation of a United Nations.

The BIG THREE of Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin had devoted hours of dialogue to the nature of a United Nations. After agreeing on the general principles at the DUMBARTON OAKS and Yalta Conferences, delegates from around the world met in San Francisco to write a charter. With the nation still mourning the recent death of Franklin Roosevelt, his wife Eleanor addressed the delegates. Despite considerable enmity and conflicts of interest among the attending nations, a charter was ultimately approved by unanimous consent.

Despite the ideological animosity spawned by the Cold War, a new spirit of globalism was born after WWII. It was based, in part, on the widespread recognition of the failures of isolationism. The incarnation of this global sprit came to life with the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 with its headquarters in New York City.






How does the UN work?

The UN charter called for the establishment of a Security Council, or "upper house." The SECURITY COUNCIL serves as the executive branch of the United Nations. The Security Council must authorize any actions, such as economic sanctions, the use of force, or the deployment of peacekeeping troops.

Each of the "GREAT POWERS" — the United States, Great Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union — holds a permanent seat on the Security Council. The remaining ten seats are elected to two-year terms by the General Assembly. Each permanent member holds the power of veto. No action can go forth if any one of the five objects. As the Cold War crystallized, the countervailing veto powers of the United States and the Soviet Union served often to inhibit the Security Council from taking any forceful or meaningful action.

The main body of the United Nations is called the GENERAL ASSEMBLY. Every member nation holds a seat in the General Assembly, which is often described as a town meeting for the world. The General Assembly has standing committees to address ongoing issues such as economics and finance, social, cultural and humanitarian concerns, and legal problems. The General Assembly passes resolutions and has the power to make recommendations to the Security Council, but has no power to require any action. In addition to the General Assembly, and ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL has committees designed to address a wide array of topics from the STATUS OF WOMEN to the ENVIRONMENT.


A TRUSTEESHIP COUNCIL was designed to oversee the transition of states from colonies to independent nations.

The Secretariat manages the day-to-day operations of the United Nations. An INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE was also created.

The UN can point to many solid accomplishments. Among them: sending peacekeepers to war-stricken areas, making recommendations on how to raise literacy and health rates in the Third World, and even authorizing the use of force against aggressor nations.

In 1945 as well as today the UN gives cause for believe that nations can get along together. In a world with conflicting histories, agendas, and political posturing, one international group — the United Nations — remains above the day-to-day fray.

When the Cold War ended in the 1990s, many citizens around the globe once again looked to the United Nations with renewed hope of building a safer, stronger planet.


'''

==== Containment and the Marshall Plan


Communism was on the march.

When the RED ARMY marched on Germany, it quickly absorbed the nearby nations ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA into the Soviet Union. Soon communist forces dominated the governments of ROMANIA and BULGARIA. By the fall of 1945, it was clear that the Soviet-backed LUBLIN REGIME had complete control of Poland, violating the Yalta promise of free and unfettered elections there. It was only a matter of time before Hungary and Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet orbit. Yugoslavia had an independent communist leader named TITO.




And now Stalin was ordering the creation of a communist PUPPET REGIME in the Soviet sector of occupied Germany. How many dominoes would fall? United States diplomats saw a continent ravaged by war looking for strong leadership and aid of any sort, providing a climate ripe for revolution. Would the Soviets get all of Germany? Or Italy and France? President Truman was determined to reverse this trend.



Greece and Turkey were the first nations spiraling into crisis that had not been directly occupied by the Soviet Army. Both countries were on the verge of being taken over by Soviet-backed guerrilla movements. Truman decided to draw a line in the sand. In March 1947, he asked Congress to appropriate $400 million to send to these two nations in the form of military and economic assistance. Within two years the communist threat had passed, and both nations were comfortably in the western sphere of influence.



A mid-level diplomat in the State Department named GEORGE KENNAN proposed the POLICY OF CONTAINMENT. Since the American people were weary from war and had no desire to send United States troops into Eastern Europe, rolling back the gains of the Red Army would have been impossible.

Marshall Plan poster

In July 1947 a majority of the American public had never even heard of the Marshall Plan. But to win passage in Congress, the Truman administration needed strong public support, so it launched a massive public relations campaign.

But in places where communism threatened to expand, American aid might prevent a takeover. By vigorously pursuing this policy, the United States might be able to contain communism within its current borders. The policy became known as the TRUMAN DOCTRINE, as the President outlined these intentions with his request for monetary aid for Greece and Turkey.

In the aftermath of WWII, Western Europe lay devastated. The war had ruined crop fields and destroyed infrastructure, leaving most of Europe in dire need. On June 5, 1947, Secretary of State GEORGE MARSHALL announced the European Recovery Program. To avoid antagonizing the Soviet Union, Marshall announced that the purpose of sending aid to Western Europe was completely humanitarian, and even offered aid to the communist states in the east. Congress approved Truman's request of $17 billion over four years to be sent to Great Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium.



The MARSHALL PLAN created an economic miracle in Western Europe. By the target date of the program four years later, Western European industries were producing twice as much as they had been the year before war broke out. Some Americans grumbled about the costs, but the nation spent more on liquor during the years of the Marshall Plan than they sent overseas to Europe. The aid also produced record levels of trade with American firms, fueling a postwar economic boom in the United States.

Lastly and much to Truman's delight, none of these nations of western Europe faced a serious threat of communist takeover for the duration of the Cold War.


'''

==== The Berlin Airlift and NATO


BERLIN, Germany's wartime capital was the prickliest of all issues that separated the United States and Soviet Union during the late 1940s. The city was divided into four ZONES OF OCCUPATION like the rest of Germany. However, the entire city lay within the Soviet zone of occupation. Once the nation of EAST GERMANY was established, the Allied sections of the capital known as West Berlin became an island of democracy and capitalism behind the IRON CURTAIN.


In June 1948, tensions within Berlin touched off a crisis.

The Soviets decided to seal all land routes going into West Berlin. Stalin gambled that the Western powers were not willing to risk another war to protect half of Berlin. The Allies were tired, and their populations were unlikely to support a new war. A withdrawal by the United States would eliminate this democratic enclave in the Soviet zone.

Truman was faced with tough choices. Relinquishing Berlin to the Soviets would seriously undermine the new doctrine of containment. Any negotiated settlement would suggest that the USSR could engineer a crisis at any time to exact concessions. If Berlin were compromised, the whole of West Germany might question the American commitment to German democracy. To Harry Truman, there was no question. "We are going to stay, period, " he declared. Together, with Britain, the United States began moving massive amounts of food and supplies into West Berlin by the only path still open — the air.


Berlin Airlift map
Flying from occupied Germany and landing a supply plane in Berlin at the rate of one every 3 minutes, the Berlin Airlift managed to supply the city with the materials needed for survival.

Truman had thrown the gauntlet at Stalin's feet. The USSR had to now choose between war and peace. He refused to give the order to shoot down the American planes. Over the next eleven months, British and American planes flew over 4000 tons of supplies daily into West Berlin. As the American public cheered "OPERATION VITTLES," Stalin began to look bad in the eyes of the world. He was clearly willing to use innocent civilians as pawns to quench his expansionist thirst. In May 1949, the Soviets ended the blockade. The United States and Britain had flown over 250,000-supply missions.

Stalin miscalculated when he estimated the strength of western unity. To cement the cooperation that the western allies had shown during the war and immediate postwar years, the NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION was created in April 1949. The pact operated on the basis of collective security. If any one of the member states were attacked, all would retaliate together. The original NATO included Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Iceland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, and the United States.

NATO was the very sort of permanent alliance GEORGE WASHINGTON warned against in his FAREWELL ADDRESS, and represented the first such agreement since the FRANCO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE that helped secure victory in the AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

The United States formally shed its ISOLATIONIST past and thrust itself forward as a determined superpower fighting its new rival.

'''

==== The Korean War


Containment had not gone so well in Asia. When the Soviet Union entered the war against Japan, they sent troops into Japanese-occupied Korea. As American troops established a presence in the southern part of the Korean peninsula, the Soviets began cutting roads and communications at the 38TH PARALLEL. Two separate governments were emerging, as Korea began to resemble the divided Germany.

Upon the recommendation of the UN, elections were scheduled, but the North refused to participate. The South elected SYNGMAN RHEE as president, but the Soviet-backed North was ruled by KIM IL SUNG. When the United States withdrew its forces from the peninsula, trouble began.

Northern Korean armed forces crossed the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950. It took only two days for President Truman to commit the United States military to the defense of southern Korea. Truman hoped to build a broad coalition against the aggressors from the North by enlisting support from the United Nations.

North Korean Tanks Cross 38th Parallel
North Korean tanks cross the 38th Parallel, marking the opening salvo of the Korean War.

Of course, the Soviet Union could veto any proposed action by the Security Council, but this time, the Americans were in luck. The Soviets were boycotting the Security Council for refusing to admit RED CHINA into the United Nations. As a result, the Council voted unanimously to "repel the armed attack" of North Korea. Many countries sent troops to defend the South, but forces beyond those of the United States and South Korea were nominal.

The commander of the UN forces was none other than Douglas MacArthur. He had an uphill battle to fight, as the North had overrun the entire peninsula with the exception of the small PUSAN PERIMETER in the South. MacArthur ordered an amphibious assault at Inchon on the western side of the peninsula on September 15.

Caught by surprise, the communist-backed northern forces reeled in retreat. American led-forces from INCHON and the Pusan Perimeter quickly pushed the northern troops to the 38th Parallel — and kept going. The United States saw an opportunity to create a complete indivisible democratic Korea and pushed the northern army up to the Yalu River, which borders China.


With anticommunism on the rise at home, Truman relished the idea of reuniting Korea. His hopes were dashed on November 27, when over 400,000 Chinese soldiers flooded across the YALU RIVER. In 1949, Mao Tse-tung had established a communist dictatorship in China, the world's most populous nation. The Chinese now sought to aide the communists in northern Korea.

In no time, American troops were once again forced below the 38th Parallel. General MacArthur wanted to escalate the war. He sought to bomb the Chinese mainland and blockade their coast.

Truman disagreed. He feared escalation of the conflict could lead to World War III, especially if the now nuclear-armed Soviet Union lent assistance to China. Disgruntled, MacArthur took his case directly to the American people by openly criticizing Truman's approach. Truman promptly fired him for insubordination.

Meanwhile, the war evolved into a stalemate, with the front line corresponding more or less to the 38th Parallel. Ceasefire negotiations dragged on for two more years, beyond Truman's Presidency. Finally, on July 27, 1953, an armistice was signed at PANMUNJOM. North Korea remained a communist dictatorship, and South Korea remained under the control of Syngman Rhee, a military strong man. Over 37,000 Americans were killed in the conflict.

Note: For decades after the war, the accepted figure for American Korean War deaths was 54,246. In 1993, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement clarifying that this figure represented all deaths of U.S. military personel worldwide during the war, and not only casualties of the war. The DoD stated that 17,730 deaths during this period were not related to the war in Korea

==== Domestic Challenges

The sign on Harry Truman's desk read "THE BUCK STOPS HERE." By buck, he meant responsibility, and the bucks ran amuck on his desk.

The end of World War II brought a series of challenges to Harry Truman. The entire economy had to be converted from a wartime economy to a consumer economy. Strikes that had been delayed during the war erupted with a frenzy across America. Inflation threatened as millions of Americans planned to spend wealth they had not enjoyed since 1929. As the soldiers returned home, they wanted their old jobs back, creating a huge labor surplus. Truman, distracted by new threats overseas, was faced with additional crises at home.

To provide relief for the veterans of World War II, and to diminish the labor surplus, Congress passed the SERVICEMAN'S READJUSTMENT ACT OF 1944. Known as the GI BILL OF RIGHTS, this law granted government loans to veterans who wished to start a new business or build a home. It also provided money for veterans to attend school or college. Thousands took advantage, and Americans enjoyed the double bonus of relieving unemployment and investing in a more educated workforce.



Although Truman maintained wartime price controls for over a year after the war, he was pressured to end them by the Republican Congress in 1947. Inflation skyrocketed and workers immediately demanded pay increases. Strikes soon spread across America involving millions of American workers.

Congress passed the TAFT-HARTLEY ACT, which allowed the President to declare a "cooling-off" period if a strike were to erupt. Union leaders became liable for damages in lawsuits and were required to sign noncommunist oaths. The ability of unions to contribute to political campaigns was limited. Truman vetoed this measure, but it was passed by the Congress nonetheless.




Serious issues remained. Now that nuclear power was a reality, who would control the fissionable materials? In August 1946, Truman signed the ATOMIC ENERGY ACT, which gave the government a monopoly over all nuclear material. Five civilians would head the ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION. They directed the peaceful uses of the atom. The President was vested with exclusive authority to launch a NUCLEAR STRIKE. The military was also reorganized.

The WAR DEPARTMENT was eliminated and a new DEFENSE DEPARTMENT was created. The Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were subordinate to the new Secretary of Defense. The NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL was created to coordinate the Departments of State and Defense. Finally, a CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY was established to monitor espionage activities around the globe.

Harry Truman kept this sign on his desk to make it known that he would not be "passing the buck" on to anyone else.
