=== The Road to Pearl Harbor 通往珍珠港之路



Storm clouds were darkening around the world. While Americans struggled to make ends meet during the Great Depression, fascism swept Italy and Germany. Elsewhere, militarists consolidated their hold on the Japanese government. Soon fears of fascist domination were realized as nations fell, hapless victims to new aggressive leaders. Remembering the scars caused by WORLD WAR I, Americans hoped against hope to remain aloof from the increasingly dangerous world.
世界各地的暴风云正在变暗。当美国人在大萧条期间努力维持生计时，法西斯主义席卷了意大利和德国。在其他地方，军国主义者巩固了对日本政府的控制。很快，随着国家的衰落，对法西斯统治的恐惧成为现实，成为新的侵略领导人的不幸受害者。美国人铭记第一次世界大战造成的伤痕，希望能够远离这个日益危险的世界。

Japan struck first, plunging into Chinese Manchuria. Next Italy struck at Ethiopia. Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, was the greatest fear. The industrial potential of Germany was awesome, and the power of the German army to inflict great damage was all too fresh in the minds of Europeans and Americans alike. Like dominoes, the nations surrounding Germany began to fall. First Austria was annexed, then Czechoslovakia. As Hitler set his sights on Poland, the world braced itself for another great conflict.
日本首先发起进攻，侵入中国满洲。接下来意大利袭击了埃塞俄比亚。阿道夫·希特勒领导下的德国是最令人恐惧的。德国的工业潜力巨大，德国军队造成巨大破坏的力量, 对欧洲人和美国人来说都记忆犹新。就像多米诺骨牌一样，德国周边的国家开始倒下。首先吞并奥地利，然后吞并捷克斯洛伐克。当希特勒把目光投向波兰时，世界准备迎接另一场伟大的冲突。

Hitler announces acquisition of Austria, 1938
Economic hard times around the globe led to the rise of fascist leaders like Adolf Hitler. Here, Hitler receives the salute of the Reichstag upon announcing the annexation of Austria.
全球经济困难时期, 导致了阿道夫·希特勒等法西斯领导人的崛起。在这里，希特勒在宣布吞并奥地利时接受德国国会大厦的致敬。
Meanwhile, Americans clung to their time-tested philosophy of isolationism. A series of Neutrality Acts sought to avoid the entrapments that plunged the nation into World War I. Poll after poll showed an unwillingness to become diplomatically involved in international disputes. Isolationist clubs spread across the land.
与此同时，美国人坚持他们经过时间考验的孤立主义哲学。一系列中立法案试图避免让国家陷入第一次世界大战的困境。一次又一次的民意调查显示，他们不愿意在外交上卷入国际争端。孤立主义俱乐部遍布全国。

Yet when Great Britain became the last bastion of freedom standing against a Nazi-controlled Europe, Americans reluctantly began to act. Led by President Roosevelt, the United States used its industrial might to become the arsenal of democracy for the Allied war effort.
然而，当英国成为对抗纳粹控制的欧洲的最后自由堡垒时，美国人不情愿地开始采取行动。在罗斯福总统的领导下，美国利用其工业实力成为盟军战争努力的民主武器库。

In the end, it was Japan who provoked the United States into war. The United States was the only nation standing against Japanese domination of the entire PACIFIC RIM. When economic sanctions against Japan produced a diplomatic stalemate, Japan launched a ruthless surprise attack against American naval bases at Pearl Harbor. Faced with an assault on its own forces, the United States finally entered the Second World War.
最终，是日本挑起了美国的战争。美国是唯一反对日本统治整个环太平洋地区的国家。当对日本的经济制裁造成外交僵局时，日本对美国珍珠港海军基地发动了无情的突然袭击。面对本国军队的攻击，美国最终加入了第二次世界大战。
