== 西部农场 & 民粹主义

=== From the Countryside to the City 从农村到城市

The modern American city was truly born in the Gilded Age.
现代美国城市真正诞生于镀金时代。

Perhaps the single greatest impact of industrialization on the growing nation was urbanization. THOMAS JEFFERSON had once idealized America as a land of small, independent farmers who became educated enough to participate in a republic. That notion was forever a part of history.
也许工业化, 对成长中国家的最大影响, 就是"城市化"。托马斯·杰斐逊曾经将美国理想化为"一片由独立小农组成的土地，他们受过足够的教育，可以加入共和国"。但这个观念已经永远成为历史的一部分了。

As large farms and improved technology displaced the small farmer, a new demand grew for labor in the American economy. Factories spread rapidly across the nation, but they did not spread evenly. Most were concentrated in urban areas, particularly in the Northeast, around the Great Lakes, and on the West Coast. And so the American workforce began to migrate from the countryside to the city.
随着大型农场和技术的进步, 取代了小农，美国经济对劳动力的新需求不断增长。工厂迅速遍布全国，但分布并不均匀。大多数集中在城市地区，特别是东北部、五大湖周围, 和西海岸。于是美国劳动力开始从农村迁移到城市。

Never before in American history had such a large number of Americans lived so close to each other.
在美国历史上，从来没有如此多的美国人彼此住得如此之近。

There was also a darker side. Beneath the magnificent skylines lay slums of abject poverty. Immigrant neighborhoods struggled to realize the American dream. Overcrowding, disease, and crime plagued many urban communities. Pollution and sewage plagued the new metropolitan centers. Corruption in local leadership often blocked needed improvements.
还有更黑暗的一面。壮丽的天际线下面是赤贫的贫民窟。移民社区努力实现美国梦。过度拥挤、疾病和犯罪, 困扰着许多城市社区。污染和污水困扰着新的大都市中心。地方领导层的腐败, 常常阻碍所需的改进。

American values were changing as a result. Urban dwellers sought new faiths to cope with new realities. Relations between men and women, and between adults and children also changed. As the 20th century approached, American ways of life were not necessarily better or worse than before. But they surely were different.
美国的价值观因此发生了变化。城市居民寻求新的信仰来应对新的现实。男女之间、成人与儿童之间的关系也发生了变化。随着20世纪的临近，美国人的生活方式并不一定比以前更好或更差。但他们肯定是不同的。

'''

==== The Underside of Urban Life 城市生活的阴暗面


Much of the urban poor, including a majority of incoming immigrants, lived in tenement housing.
许多城市贫民，包括大多数新移民，都住在廉价公寓里

Because of the massive overcrowding, disease was widespread. CHOLERA and YELLOW-FEVER epidemics swept through the slums on a regular basis. TUBERCULOSIS was a huge killer. Infants suffered the most. Almost 25% of babies born in late-19th century cities died before reaching the age of one.
由于大规模过度拥挤，疾病广泛传播。霍乱和黄热病流行病, 经常席卷贫民窟。结核病是一个巨大的杀手。婴儿受害最深。 19 世纪末城市出生的婴儿中，近 25% 在一岁之前死亡。

==== The Rush of Immigrants 移民潮

immigration to the United States reached its peak from 1880-1920. The so-called "OLD IMMIGRATION" brought thousands of Irish and German people to the New World.
1880年至1920年间，美国移民数量达到顶峰。(以前,) 所谓的“旧移民”将成千上万的爱尔兰人和德国人带到了新世界。

This time, although those groups would continue to come, even greater ethnic diversity would grace America's populace. Many would come from Southern and Eastern Europe, and some would come from as far away as Asia.
但这一次(的新移民潮中)，尽管这些旧来源的群体会继续出现，但更大的种族多样性, 将给美国民众带来好处。(如今这批新移民中的)许多人来自南欧和东欧，还有一些来自遥远的亚洲。


Most immigrant groups that had formerly come to America by choice seemed distinct, but in fact had many similarities. Most had come from Northern and Western Europe. Most had some experience with representative democracy. With the exception of the Irish, most were PROTESTANT. Many were literate, and some possessed a fair degree of wealth.
(以前的移民中, )大多数以前自愿来到美国的移民群体, 虽然看似截然不同，但实际上他们有许多相似之处。大多数人来自北欧和西欧。大多数人都有一些代议制民主的经验。除爱尔兰人外，大多数人都是新教徒。许多人受过教育，有些人拥有相当程度的财富。

The new groups arriving by the boatload in the Gilded Age were characterized by few of these traits. Their nationalities included Greek, Italian, Polish, Slovak, Serb, Russian, Croat, and others. Until cut off by federal decree, Japanese and Chinese settlers relocated to the American West Coast. None of these groups were predominantly Protestant.
而镀金时代涌入的这批新群体, 就几乎没有那些特征了。新移民的来源国籍包括希腊、意大利、波兰、斯洛伐克、塞尔维亚、俄罗斯、克罗地亚等。直到"移民流入"被联邦法令禁止之前，日本和中国定居者迁移到了美国西海岸。这些群体中, 没有一个来源国, 主要是信奉新教徒的。

The vast majority were ROMAN CATHOLIC or EASTERN ORTHODOX. However, due to increased persecution of JEWS in Eastern Europe, many Jewish immigrants sought freedom from torment. Very few newcomers spoke any English, and large numbers were illiterate in their native tongues. None of these groups hailed from democratic regimes. The American form of government was as foreign as its culture.
绝大多数是罗马天主教徒或东正教徒。然而，由于在东欧对犹太人的迫害加剧，许多犹太移民寻求摆脱折磨的自由。很少有新移民能说一口英语，很多人在自己的母语中都是文盲。这些群体中没有一个来自民主政权。美国的政府形式和文化一样陌生。

The new American cities became the destination of many of the most destitute. Once the trend was established, letters from America from friends and family beckoned new immigrants to ethnic enclaves such as CHINATOWN, GREEKTOWN, or LITTLE ITALY. This led to an urban ethnic patchwork, with little integration. The dumbbell tenement and all of its woes became the reality for most newcomers until enough could be saved for an upward move.
新的美国城市, 成为许多最贫困人口的目的地。这一趋势一旦确立，来自美国的朋友和家人的来信, 就会吸引新移民前往唐人街、希腊城, 或小意大利等少数民族聚居地。这导致了城市民族的杂乱无章，几乎没有融合。对于大多数新移民来说，哑铃公寓及其所有的困境, 都成为了现实，直到能够攒够足够的钱, 来实现阶层跨越。

Despite the horrors of tenement housing and factory work, many agreed that the wages they could earn and the food they could eat surpassed their former realities. Still, as many as 25% of the European immigrants of this time never intended to become American citizens. These so-called "BIRDS OF PASSAGE" simply earned enough income to send to their families and returned to their former lives.
尽管廉价公寓和工厂工作令人恐惧，但许多人都认为, 他们能赚到的工资和吃到的食物, 还是超出了他们以前的待遇。尽管如此，当时有多达 25% 的欧洲移民, 从未打算成为真正的美国公民。这些所谓的“候鸟”, 只是为了赚到足够的收入寄给家人，然后他们又会回到了从前的生活中去。

Not all Americans welcomed the new immigrants with open arms.
并非所有美国人都张开双臂欢迎新移民。

Gradually, these "NATIVISTS" lobbied successfully to restrict the flow of immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT, barring this ethnic group in its entirety. Twenty-five years later, Japanese immigration was restricted by executive agreement. These two Asian groups were the only ethnicities to be completely excluded from America.
渐渐地，这些“本土主义者”成功地进行了游说, 限制了移民的流动。 1882年，国会通过了《排华法案》，将这一族群全部排除在外。二十五年后，日本移民受到行政协议的限制。这两个亚洲群体, 是唯一被完全排除在美国之外的种族。

Criminals, contract workers, the mentally ill, anarchists, and alcoholics were among groups to be gradually barred from entry by Congress. In 1917, Congress required the passing of a literacy test to gain admission. Finally, in 1924, the door was shut to millions by placing an absolute cap on new immigrants based on ethnicity. That cap was based on the United States population of 1890 and was therefore designed to favor the previous immigrant groups.
罪犯、合同工、精神病患者、无政府主义者, 和酗酒者等群体, 逐渐被国会禁止入境。1917年，国会要求通过识字测试才能入境。最后，**在1924年，美国根据种族, 对新移民的准入数量设置了绝对上限，**从而关闭了数百万移民入境的大门。这个上限是根据1890年的美国人口制定的，因此是为了照顾以前的移民群体。

But millions had already come. During the age when the STATUE OF LIBERTY beckoned the world's "huddled masses yearning to breathe free," American diversity mushroomed. Each brought pieces of an old culture and made contributions to a new one. Although many former Europeans swore to their deaths to maintain their old ways of life, their children did not agree. Most enjoyed a higher standard of living than their parents, learned English easily, and sought American lifestyles. At least to that extent, America was a MELTING POT.
但数百万人已经来了。在自由女神像向全世界“渴望自由呼吸的群众”招手的时代，美国的多样性如雨后春笋般涌现。每个人都带来了旧文化国家中的片段，并为美国熔炉的新文化做出了贡献。尽管许多前欧洲人发誓誓死维持他们原有的生活方式，但他们的孩子却不一定赞同。大多数人比他们的父母辈, 享有了更高的生活水平，能轻松学会英语，并追求美国的生活方式。至少在某种程度上，美国是一个文化的熔炉。

==== Religious Revival: The "Social Gospel" 宗教复兴：“社会福音”

Most political bosses appealed to the newest, most desperate part of the growing populace — the immigrants.
大多数政治领袖, 都吸引了不断增长的民众中最新、最绝望的部分——移民。

The Protestant churches of America feared the worst. Although the population of America was growing by leaps and bounds, there were many empty seats in the pews of urban Protestant churches. Middle-class churchgoers were ever faithful, but large numbers of workers were starting to lose faith in the local church. The old-style heaven and hell sermons just seemed irrelevant to those who toiled long, long hours for small, small wages.
美国的新教教会担心, 最坏的情况正在发生。尽管美国人口突飞猛进，但城市新教教堂的长椅上, 仍然有许多空座位(即没人去教堂了)。去教堂做礼拜的中产阶级一直很忠诚，但大量工人开始对当地教会失去信心。对那些长时间辛苦工作却只挣得微薄工资的人来说, 布道你死后会去往老式的天堂还是地狱, 似乎无关紧要。

Immigration swelled the ranks of Roman Catholic churches. Eastern Orthodox churches and Jewish synagogues were sprouting up everywhere. At the same time, many cities reported the loss of Protestant congregations. They would have to face this challenge or perish.
新移民壮大了"罗马天主教会"的队伍。东正教教堂和犹太教堂随处可见。与此同时，许多城市报告新教教会数量却在减少。*他们必须面对这一挑战，否则新教就会灭亡。*

Preaching for Politics 为政治讲道

Out of this concern grew the social gospel movement. Progressive-minded preachers began to tie the teachings of the church with contemporary problems. Christian virtue, they declared, demanded a redress of poverty and despair on earth.
*出于这种担忧，"社会福音运动"应运而生。思想进步的传教士们, 开始将"教会的教义"与"当代的现实问题"联系起来。他们宣称，基督教的美德, 要求必须纠正地球上人们的贫困和绝望。*

Many ministers became politically active. WASHINGTON GLADDEN, the most prominent of the social gospel ministers, supported the workers' right to strike in the wake of the Great Upheaval of 1877. Ministers called for an end to child labor, the enactment of temperance laws, and civil service reform.
**许多牧师开始在政治上活跃起来。**华盛顿·格拉登是最著名的"社会福音派牧师"，他支持工人在 1877 年大动乱后罢工的权利。*牧师们还呼吁结束童工、颁布禁酒法, 和进行公务员制度改革。*

Liberal churches such as the CONGREGATIONALISTS and the UNITARIANS led the way, but the movement spread to many sects. Middle class women became particularly active in the arena of social reform.
诸如"公理会"和"统一派"等自由派教会, 引领了这些运动，但这场运动也蔓延到了许多其他教派中。中产阶级妇女, 在"社会改革领域"变得尤其活跃。


The Third Great Awakening
第三次大觉醒

The changes were profound. Many historians call this period in the history of American religion the THIRD GREAT AWAKENING. Like the first two awakenings, it was characterized by revival and reform. The temperance movement and the settlement house movement were both affected by church activism. The chief difference between this movement and those of an earlier era was location. These changes in religion transpired because of urban realities, underscoring the social impact of the new American city.
**这些变化是深远的。许多历史学家, 将美国宗教史上的这一时期, 称为“第三次大觉醒”。**与前两次觉醒一样，它的特点是"复兴"和"改革"。禁酒运动和社区服务运动, 都受到了教会积极参与的影响。这一运动与早期时代的运动之间的主要区别, 在于"地点"。这些宗教上的变化, 是由"城市现实"引起的，强调了新兴美国城市的社会影响。


.案例
====
.第三次大觉醒
以布朗大学麦克洛克林（William McLoughlin）教授为代表的一些历史学家, 已经划分了美国历史上的三次“宗教大觉醒”，福格尔则提出了**美国的四次“宗教-政治周期”。**因此，他的“大觉醒”概念是"指宗教-政治周期"，而不是单纯的宗教大觉醒。*每一次"宗教-政治周期"都包含“宗教复兴阶段” “政治影响力上升阶段”和“对主要政治方案的挑战不断增加的阶段”，在后来两个阶段的参与者, 并不一定是宗教信徒.*

第一次大觉醒从1730年到1830年，它导致了美国独立建国的革命。

第二次大觉醒大约从1800年到1920年，它的宗教复兴阶段强调奴隶制不是“上帝第二次降临”的适当环境，导致了反奴隶制运动并最终引发了美国南北战争。

第三次大觉醒从1890年开始，至今还没结束，而是处在和1960年开始的第四次大觉醒的重叠时期。**第三次大觉醒的宗教理论“社会福音派”认为，“贫困不是个人罪恶的代价”，而是社会条件造成的。**1930年代罗斯福新政, 和1960年代约翰逊“伟大社会”的福利国家理念, 体现了第三次大觉醒的社会伦理观——*条件平等。*

=== Western Folkways 美国西边的民俗


When the Native Americans were placed on reservations, one of the last barriers to western expansion was lifted. The railroad could get people where they wanted to go, and the resources of the West seemed boundless.
当美洲原住民被置于保留地时，向西部扩张的最后障碍之一, 也就被解除了。铁路可以把人们送到他们想去的地方，而西方的资源似乎取之不尽用之不竭。

How did the typical Westerner make a living? Although migrant settlers had skills too numerous to mention, the most dominant Western industries were mining, ranching, and farming.
典型的美国西部人, 是如何谋生的？尽管移民定居者拥有的技能不胜枚举，但**西方最主要的产业是采矿业、畜牧业和农业。**



Eastern industry required lead and other precious metals. The inventions of the telephone, light bulb, and DYNAMO (a massive generator that could pump electricity directly into people's homes) all required copper wiring. New mining techniques presented the possibility for large-scale industry to provide these necessary ores. Life in the western mining towns contributed much to the legendary lore of the American West.
东部工业需要铅和其他贵金属。电话、灯泡和 DYNAMO（一种可以将电力直接输送到人们家中的大型发电机）的发明都需要铜线。新的采矿技术, 为大规模工业提供这些必要的矿石, 提供了可能性。西部矿业城镇的生活, 为美国西部的传奇故事, 做出了很大贡献。

Demand for beef soared after the Civil War. Learning from the Spanish Mexican tradition, cattle ranchers sought their fortunes in Southern Texas. The archetypal American cowboy was needed between 1866 and 1889 to move the steer to market. Life on the open prairies became a reality for thousands of cowhands during the American cattle boom.
内战后，对牛肉的需求猛增。牧场主借鉴西班牙墨西哥传统，在德克萨斯州南部寻求财富。 从1866年到1889年，美国需要典型的牛仔们, 来把牛(牛肉)推向交易市场。在美国的养牛热潮中，辽阔草原上的生活, 就成为了成千上万的牧牛人的现实。


==== Bonanza 富矿

BONANZA! That was the exclamation when a large vein of valuable ore was discovered. Thousands of optimistic Americans and even a few foreigners dreamed of finding a bonanza and retiring at a very young age.
富矿！这是发现一大片有价值的矿石时发出的惊叹声。成千上万乐观的美国人，甚至一些外国人，都梦想着找到一笔财富并在很年轻的时候就退休。

Ten years after the 1849 CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH, new deposits were gradually found throughout the West. Colorado yielded gold and silver at PIKES PEAK in 1859 and LEADVILLE IN 1873. NEVADA claimed COMSTOCK LODE, the largest of American silver strikes.
1849年加利福尼亚淘金热十年后，新的矿藏逐渐在整个西部被发现。科罗拉多于1859年和1873年, 分别在派克峰和莱德维尔, 开采了黄金和白银。内华达州宣称拥有美国最大的银矿——康斯托克矿脉。

From COEUR D'ALENE in Idaho to TOMBSTONE in Arizona, BOOM TOWNS flowered across the American West. They produced not only gold and silver, but zinc, copper, and lead, all essential for the eastern Industrial Revolution. Soon the West was filled with ne'er-do-wells hoping to strike it rich.
从爱达荷州的科达伦(COEUR D'ALENE), 到亚利桑那州的墓碑镇(TOMBSTONE)，新兴城镇在美国西部遍地开花。他们不仅生产黄金和白银，还生产锌、铜和铅，这些都是美国东部工业革命的必需品。很快，西部就充满了希望发财致富的无业游民。

Prospecting 勘探

Few were so lucky. The chances of an individual prospector finding a valuable lode were slim indeed. The gold-seeker often worked in a stream bed. A tin pan was filled with sediment and water. After shaking, the heavier gold nuggets would sink to the bottom. Rarely was anything found of substantial size.
很少有人如此幸运。个人探矿者找到有价值矿脉的机会, 确实很小。淘金者经常在河床上工作。他们手中的锡盘里, 装满了沉积物和水。经过摇晃后，较重的金块会沉到底部。但很少发现任何尺寸较大的东西。



Once the loose chunks of gold were removed from the surface, large machinery was required to dig into the earth and to split the quartz where the elusive gold was often hidden. This was too large of an operation for an individual prospector. Eastern investors conducted these ventures and often profited handsomely. The best case scenario for the prospector was to locate a large deposit and sell the claim. Those who were not as lucky often eventually went to work in the mines of the Eastern financiers.
一旦松散的大块黄金从地表被挖出，就需要大型机械挖入地下，并将石英分开，因为石英里往往隐藏着难以捉摸的黄金。对于个人探矿者来说，这是一项规模太大的行动。来自美国东边的投资者进行这些冒险活动, 并常常获得丰厚的利润。对于探矿者来说，最好的情况是找到大量矿床, 并出售矿权。而对于那些不那么幸运的人来说, 他们最终往往只能给来自东方金融家打工, 去他们的矿井中工作。

WESTERN MINING wrought havoc on the local environment. Rock dust from drilling was often dumped into river beds, forming silt deposits downstream that flooded towns and farmlands. Miners and farmers were often at loggerheads over the effects of one enterprise on the other. Poisonous underground gases, mostly containing sulfur, were released into the atmosphere. Removing gold from quartz required mercury, the excess of which polluted local streams and rivers. Strip mining caused erosion and further desertification. Little was done to regulate the mining industry until the turn of the 20th century.
西部采矿业, 对当地环境造成了严重破坏。钻探产生的岩尘, 经常被倾倒到河床中，在下游形成淤泥沉积物，会淹没城镇和农田。矿工和农民, 经常因为一个企业对另一个企业的影响, 而发生争执。主要含有硫的地下有毒气体, 被释放到大气中。从石英中提取金, 需要用到汞，而过量的汞会污染当地的溪流和河流。露天采矿, 也造成了侵蚀和进一步的荒漠化。对采矿业进行的监管工作, 直到 20 世纪之交还很少存在。

Life in a Mining Town
矿业小镇的生活

Each mining bonanza required a town. Many towns had as high as a 9-to-1 male-to-female ratio. The ethnic diversity was great. Mexican immigrants were common. Native Americans avoided the mining industry, but mestizos, the offspring of Mexican and Native American parents, often participated. Many African Americans aspired to the same get-rich-quick idea as whites. Until excluded by federal law in 1882, Chinese Americans were numerous in mining towns.
每一个金矿, 工人都需要建一个城镇来居住。许多城镇的男女比例高达9:1。种族多样性是巨大的。墨西哥移民很常见。印第安人则回避采矿业，但墨西哥人和印第安人的后代混血儿, 却经常参与其中。许多非裔美国人渴望像白人一样快速致富。在1882年被联邦法律排除入境之前，在采矿城镇中, 华裔有很多。

The ethnic patchwork was intricate, but the socio-economic ladder was clearly defined. Whites owned and managed all of the mines. Poor whites, Mexicans and Chinese Americans worked the mine shafts. A few African Americans joined them, but many worked in the service sector as cooks or artisans.
虽然参与挖矿的种族, 错综复杂，但社会阶层, 却有着明确的分界限。白人拥有并管理着所有矿山。白人中的贫穷者、墨西哥人和华裔, 则做矿井里的工人。一些非裔美国人虽然也加入过这些工作，但许多人是在服务行业担任厨师或工匠的。

It is these mining towns that often conjure images of the mythical American Wild West. Most did have a saloon (or several) with swinging doors and a player piano. But miners and prospectors worked all day; few had the luxury of spending it at the bar. By nighttime, most were too tired to carouse. Weekends might bring folks out to the saloon for gambling or drinking, to engage in the occasional bar fight, or even to hire a prostitute.
正是这些矿镇常常勾勒出美国西部的神秘形象。大多数矿镇确实有一个或几个带摇摆门和自动钢琴的酒吧。但矿工和探矿者整天都在工作，很少有人有在酒吧度过的奢侈。到了夜晚，大多数人都太疲倦以至于无法去狂欢。周末可能会有人来酒吧赌博或喝酒，参与偶尔的酒吧斗殴，甚至雇佣妓女。

Law enforcement was crude. Many towns could not afford a sheriff, so vigilante justice prevailed. Occasionally a posse, or hunting party, would be raised to capture a particularly nettlesome miscreant.
矿镇中的执法手段较为粗糙。许多城镇负担不起雇佣治安官，因此私刑司法盛行。偶尔会组成武装队伍或追捕小组，以逮捕特别令人讨厌的罪犯。

When the bonanza was at its zenith, the town prospered. But eventually the mines were exhausted or proved fruitless. Slowly its inhabitants would leave, leaving behind nothing but a ghost town.
当财富达到顶峰时，这个小镇就繁荣起来。但最终这些矿井要么被耗尽，要么毫无成果。慢慢地，它的居民会离开，只留下一座鬼城。

==== The Ways of the Cowboy 牛仔之路

Mining was not the only bonanza to be found in the West. Millions could be made in the CATTLE INDUSTRY. A calf bought for $5 in Southern Texas might sell for $60 in Chicago. The problem was, of course, getting the cattle to market.
采矿并不是西部唯一的发财之路. 养牛业可以赚取数百万美元。在德克萨斯州南部以 5 美元购买的一头小牛, 在芝加哥可能会卖到 60 美元。当然，问题在于如何将牛推向市场。


Myth vs. Reality 神话与现实

Americans did not invent cattle raising. This tradition was learned from the vaquero, a Mexican cowboy. The vacqueros taught the tricks of the trade to the Texans, who realized the potential for great profits.
美国人没有发明养牛。这一传统是从墨西哥牛仔 Vaquero 那里学来的。牛仔们向德克萨斯人传授了贸易技巧，他们意识到了巨大利润的潜力。

The typical COWBOY wore a hat with a wide brim to provide protection from the unforgiving sunlight. Cattle kicked up clouds of dust on the drive, so the cowboy donned a bandanna over the lower half of his face. CHAPS, or leggings, and high boots were worn as protection from briars and cactus needles.
典型的牛仔戴着宽边帽子，以抵御无情的阳光。牛群在道路上扬起了尘土，所以牛仔在下半张脸上戴了一条大手帕。穿着CHAPS（或紧身裤）和高筒靴，以防止荆棘和仙人掌针。

Contrary to legend, the typical cowboy was not a skilled marksman. The lariat, not the gun, was how the cattle drover showed his mastery. About a quarter of all cowboys were African Americans, and even more were at least partially Mexican. To avoid additional strain on the horses, cowboys were usually smaller than according to legend.
与传说相反，典型的牛仔并不是熟练的射手。赶牛人是通过套索而不是枪, 来展示他的技艺的。大约四分之一的牛仔是非裔美国人，更多的牛仔至少有部分是墨西哥人。*为了避免给马带来额外的压力，牛仔通常比传说中的要小。*

The lone cowboy is an American myth. Cattle were always driven by a group of DROVERS. The cattle were branded so the owner could distinguish his STEER from the rest. Several times per DRIVE, cowboys conducted a roundup where the cattle would be sorted and counted again.
孤独的牛仔, 是一个美国神话。牛总是由一群赶牛人赶。这些牛都被打上烙印，这样主人就可以将他的牛, 与其他牛区分开来。每次驱赶时，牛仔都会进行几次围捕，对牛进行分类并再次清点。

Work was very difficult. The workdays lasted fifteen hours, much of which was spent in the saddle. Occasionally, shots were fired by hostile Indians or farmers. Cattle RUSTLERS sometimes stole their steers.
工作非常困难。工作日持续十五个小时，其中大部分时间是在马鞍上度过的。偶尔，敌对的印第安人或农民, 也会开枪。偷牛者有时会偷走他们的牛。

One of the greatest fears was the STAMPEDE, which could result in lost or dead cattle or cowboys. One method of containing a stampede was to get the cattle to run in a circle, where the steer would eventually tire.
最可怕的事情之一是牛群踩踏事件，这可能会导致牛或牛仔丢失或死亡。遏制踩踏事件的一种方法, 是让牛绕圈跑，这样牛最终会感到疲倦。

Upon reaching Abilene, the cattle were sold. Then it was time to let loose. Abilene had twenty-five saloons open all hours to service incoming riders of the long drive.
到达阿比林后，牛就被卖掉了。然后是时候放松了。阿比林有 25 家酒吧全天候营业，为长途奔波的乘客提供服务。

Twilight of the Cowboy
牛仔的黄昏

The heyday of the long drive was short. By the early 1870s, rail lines reached Texas so the cattle could be shipped directly to the slaughterhouses. Ranchers then began to allow cattle to graze on the open range near rail heads. But even this did not last. The invention of BARBED WIRE by JOSEPH GLIDDEN ruined the OPEN RANGE. Now farmers could cheaply mark their territory to keep the unwanted steers off their lands. Overproduction caused prices to fall, leading many ranchers out of business.
"长途驱牛, 来送到城市"的鼎盛时期很短暂。到了1870年代初，铁路线已经延伸到德克萨斯，因此, 牛只可以直接运往屠宰场。牧场主随后开始允许牛只在靠近铁路站的开放区域上放牧。但即便如此，这种情况也未能持续。约瑟夫·格里登发明的有刺铁丝网, 破坏了开放牧场。现在，农民可以廉价地标明他们的领地，以阻止不受欢迎的牛只进入他们的土地来吃草。生产过剩导致价格下跌，导致许多牧场主破产。

==== Life on the Farm 农场生活


A homestead at last! Many eastern families who longed for the opportunity to own and farm a plot of land of their own were able to realize their dreams when Congress passed the HOMESTEAD ACT in 1862. That landmark piece of legislation provided 160 acres free to any family who lived on the land for five years and made improvements. The same amount could be obtained instantly for the paltry sum of $1.25 per acre.
终于有了自己的宅基地了！当国会于 1862 年通过《宅基地法》时，许多渴望有机会"拥有, 和耕种自己土地"的东部家庭, 得以实现他们的梦想。这项具有里程碑意义的法案, 为任何在土地上居住五年, 并进行改良的家庭, 提供了免费的160英亩土地。同样的土地, 也可以立即获得，每英亩只需微薄的1.25美元。

.Homestead Acts 宅地法
是1862年美国联邦政府颁布的"针对农业发展，*以很低的价格转让, 或无偿分配国有土地, 给开垦荒地者*"的一系列法案。仅这一系列法案中的第一部 -- 1862年宅地法，就开拓了数百万英亩土地。宅地法案的终止时间是1976年，阿拉斯加州是唯一特例，1986年终止。

image:/img/061.jpg[,30%]

**美国独立后，联邦政府逐渐向西部推进，对取得的西部土地先实行"国有化"，并决定按地段分块出售，以增加政府的收入，偿还国债, 和满足土地投机者的要求。但出售的土地单位，通常是面积大、价格高，西部移民无力购买，因而北方人展开了长期争取"无偿分配土地"的斗争。**这边来讲，可以分为北方人（Northerner）想要个体农民拥有, 并运作自己的农场; 而南方的奴隶主, 则想要大块的土地, 并使用奴隶来劳作的模式。

19世纪中期, 美国联邦政府制定法律，**将政府土地免费转让给民众“安身立命”，**此举不但推动了西部开发的进程，也大大增加了“民者有其田”的家庭数目，据不完全统计，*约有200万家庭获得了总计2.7至2.85亿英亩的政府土地，面积约占全国土地总面积的八分之一。*

这项被称为“宅地法”（Homestead Act）的土地法通过的目的，是向农民提供公共土地以开发西部地区。**不过在南北战争之前，南部各州, 并不赞同此类让百姓获得无偿土地的法案，因为南部蓄奴州担心, 这样会增加北方自由州的数量，**导致国会议席的分配有利于自由州。最初的宅地法于1858年在众议院通过，但在参议院被一票否决；第二年，国会通过了类似法案，但被詹姆斯·布坎南（James Buchanan）总统否决。

**南北战争爆发以后，随着南方各州脱离联邦，"宅地法"在共和党主导的国会被通过、由林肯总统于1862年5月20日签署成为法律，**并于1863年1月1日实施。

There were tremendous economic difficulties associated with Western farm life. First and foremost was overproduction. Because the amount of land under cultivation increased dramatically and new farming techniques produced greater and greater yields, the food market became so flooded with goods that prices fell sharply. While this might be great for the consumer, the farmer had to grow a tremendous amount of food to recoup enough profits to survive the winter.
**西方的农场生活面, 临着巨大的经济困难。首先也是最重要的, 是生产过剩。**由于耕地面积急剧增加，新的耕作技术产量越来越高，**食品市场上商品泛滥，价格急剧下跌。**虽然这对消费者来说可能是件好事，但农民必须种植大量粮食, 才能收回足够的利润来过冬。



New machinery and fertilizer was needed to farm on a large scale. Often farmers borrowed money to purchase this equipment, leaving themselves hopelessly in debt when the harvest came. The high tariff forced them to pay higher prices for household goods for their families, while the goods they themselves sold were unprotected.
大规模耕种, 需要新的机械和肥料。农民常常借钱购买这些设备，当收获季节到来时，他们就负债累累。高关税迫使他们为了家人, 要支付更高的价格来购买生活用品，而他们自己出售的商品, 却不受价格保护。

The railroads also fleeced the small farmer. Farmers were often charged higher rates to ship their goods a short distance than a manufacturer would pay to transport wares a great distance.
铁路公司也敲诈了小农。农民短距离运输货物, 被收取的费用, 通常高于"制造商长距离运输货物"所支付的费用。


Farmers lacked political power. Washington was a long way from the Great Plains, and politicians seemed to turn deaf ears to the farmers' cries. Social problems were also prevalent. With each neighbor on 160-acre plots of land, communication was difficult and loneliness was widespread.
*农民也缺乏政治上的权力。华盛顿距离大平原很远，政客们似乎对农民的呼声充耳不闻。社会问题也普遍存在。每个邻居都住在 160 英亩的土地上，沟通很困难，孤独感普遍存在。*

==== The Growth of Populism 民粹主义的增长

Organization was inevitable. Like the oppressed laboring classes of the East, it was only a matter of time before Western farmers would attempt to use their numbers to effect positive change.
组织是不可避免的。就像东方受压迫的劳动阶级一样，西部农民试图利用他们的人数, 来实现积极的变革, 这只是时间问题。

Farmers Organize 农民组织

In 1867, the first such national organization was formed. Led by OLIVER KELLEY, the PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY, also known as the GRANGE, organized to address the social isolation of farm life. Like other SECRET SOCIETIES, such as the MASONS, GRANGERS had local chapters with secret passwords and rituals.
1867 年，第一个此类全国性组织成立。在奥利弗·凯利 (Oliver Kelley) 的领导下，"畜牧赞助者组织"（也称为 GRANGE）组织起来，旨在解决农场生活中的"社会孤立问题"。与共济会等其他秘密社团一样，格兰杰斯也有地方分会，有秘密密码和仪式。

Identifying the railroads as the chief villains, Grangers lobbied state legislatures for regulation of the industry. By 1874, several states passed the GRANGER LAWS, establishing maximum shipping rates. Grangers also pooled their resources to buy grain elevators of their own so that members could enjoy a break on grain storage.
格兰杰斯认为, 铁路是罪魁祸首，他游说"州立法机关"对该行业进行监管。到 1874 年，几个州通过了"格兰杰法"，确定了最高运费。格兰杰们还集中资源购买了自己的粮仓，让会员们可以享受粮食储存的休息。

格兰杰法是美国中西部几个州，即明尼苏达州、爱荷华州、威斯康星州和伊利诺伊州于 1860 年代末和 1870 年代初通过的一系列法律。 格兰杰法主要是由一群被称为“国家农庄”的农民推动的。格兰杰的主要目标是规范"美国内战"后铁路和谷物电梯公司不断上涨的票价。

格兰杰法的某些方面因州而异，但所有涉及的州都有相同的意图：使铁路费率的定价更有利于各州的农民，特别是小农。这种共同的愿望是全国畜牧赞助人农庄（Grange）在州政治中大力推广这些法律的结果。

FARMERS' ALLIANCES went one step further. Beginning in 1889, NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN FARMERS' ALLIANCES championed the same issues as the Grangers, but also entered the political arena. Members of these alliances won seats in state legislatures across the Great Plains to strengthen the agrarian voice in politics.
农民联盟更进一步。从 1889 年开始，南北农民联盟支持与格兰杰家族相同的问题，但也进入了政治舞台。*这些联盟的成员, 在大平原地区的"州立法机构"中赢得了席位，以加强农民在政治中的声音。*

Creating Inflation 制造通货膨胀

What did all the farmers seem to have in common? The answer was simple: debt. Looking for solutions to this condition, farmers began to attack the nation's monetary system. As of 1873, Congress declared that all federal money must be backed by gold. This limited the nation's money supply and benefited the wealthy.
**所有农民似乎有什么共同点？答案很简单：债务。为了寻找解决这种情况的方法，农民开始攻击国家的货币体系。**自 1873 年起，国会宣布所有联邦货币都必须以黄金为后盾。这限制了国家的货币供应量, 并使富人受益。

The farmers wanted to create INFLATION. Inflation actually helps debtors.

=== From the Countryside to the City

The modern American city was truly born in the Gilded Age.

Perhaps the single greatest impact of industrialization on the growing nation was urbanization. THOMAS JEFFERSON had once idealized America as a land of small, independent farmers who became educated enough to participate in a republic. That notion was forever a part of history.

As large farms and improved technology displaced the small farmer, a new demand grew for labor in the American economy. Factories spread rapidly across the nation, but they did not spread evenly. Most were concentrated in urban areas, particularly in the Northeast, around the Great Lakes, and on the West Coast. And so the American workforce began to migrate from the countryside to the city.

Never before in American history had such a large number of Americans lived so close to each other.

There was also a darker side. Beneath the magnificent skylines lay slums of abject poverty. Immigrant neighborhoods struggled to realize the American dream. Overcrowding, disease, and crime plagued many urban communities. Pollution and sewage plagued the new metropolitan centers. Corruption in local leadership often blocked needed improvements.

American values were changing as a result. Urban dwellers sought new faiths to cope with new realities. Relations between men and women, and between adults and children also changed. As the 20th century approached, American ways of life were not necessarily better or worse than before. But they surely were different.

'''

==== The Underside of Urban Life


Much of the urban poor, including a majority of incoming immigrants, lived in tenement housing.

Because of the massive overcrowding, disease was widespread. CHOLERA and YELLOW-FEVER epidemics swept through the slums on a regular basis. TUBERCULOSIS was a huge killer. Infants suffered the most. Almost 25% of babies born in late-19th century cities died before reaching the age of one.


'''

==== The Rush of Immigrants

immigration to the United States reached its peak from 1880-1920. The so-called "OLD IMMIGRATION" brought thousands of Irish and German people to the New World.

This time, although those groups would continue to come, even greater ethnic diversity would grace America's populace. Many would come from Southern and Eastern Europe, and some would come from as far away as Asia.


Most immigrant groups that had formerly come to America by choice seemed distinct, but in fact had many similarities. Most had come from Northern and Western Europe. Most had some experience with representative democracy. With the exception of the Irish, most were PROTESTANT. Many were literate, and some possessed a fair degree of wealth.

The new groups arriving by the boatload in the Gilded Age were characterized by few of these traits. Their nationalities included Greek, Italian, Polish, Slovak, Serb, Russian, Croat, and others. Until cut off by federal decree, Japanese and Chinese settlers relocated to the American West Coast. None of these groups were predominantly Protestant.

The vast majority were ROMAN CATHOLIC or EASTERN ORTHODOX. However, due to increased persecution of JEWS in Eastern Europe, many Jewish immigrants sought freedom from torment. Very few newcomers spoke any English, and large numbers were illiterate in their native tongues. None of these groups hailed from democratic regimes. The American form of government was as foreign as its culture.

The new American cities became the destination of many of the most destitute. Once the trend was established, letters from America from friends and family beckoned new immigrants to ethnic enclaves such as CHINATOWN, GREEKTOWN, or LITTLE ITALY. This led to an urban ethnic patchwork, with little integration. The dumbbell tenement and all of its woes became the reality for most newcomers until enough could be saved for an upward move.

Despite the horrors of tenement housing and factory work, many agreed that the wages they could earn and the food they could eat surpassed their former realities. Still, as many as 25% of the European immigrants of this time never intended to become American citizens. These so-called "BIRDS OF PASSAGE" simply earned enough income to send to their families and returned to their former lives.

Not all Americans welcomed the new immigrants with open arms.

Gradually, these "NATIVISTS" lobbied successfully to restrict the flow of immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT, barring this ethnic group in its entirety. Twenty-five years later, Japanese immigration was restricted by executive agreement. These two Asian groups were the only ethnicities to be completely excluded from America.

Criminals, contract workers, the mentally ill, anarchists, and alcoholics were among groups to be gradually barred from entry by Congress. In 1917, Congress required the passing of a literacy test to gain admission. Finally, in 1924, the door was shut to millions by placing an absolute cap on new immigrants based on ethnicity. That cap was based on the United States population of 1890 and was therefore designed to favor the previous immigrant groups.

But millions had already come. During the age when the STATUE OF LIBERTY beckoned the world's "huddled masses yearning to breathe free," American diversity mushroomed. Each brought pieces of an old culture and made contributions to a new one. Although many former Europeans swore to their deaths to maintain their old ways of life, their children did not agree. Most enjoyed a higher standard of living than their parents, learned English easily, and sought American lifestyles. At least to that extent, America was a MELTING POT.

'''

==== Religious Revival: The "Social Gospel"

Most political bosses appealed to the newest, most desperate part of the growing populace — the immigrants.

The Protestant churches of America feared the worst. Although the population of America was growing by leaps and bounds, there were many empty seats in the pews of urban Protestant churches. Middle-class churchgoers were ever faithful, but large numbers of workers were starting to lose faith in the local church. The old-style heaven and hell sermons just seemed irrelevant to those who toiled long, long hours for small, small wages.

Immigration swelled the ranks of Roman Catholic churches. Eastern Orthodox churches and Jewish synagogues were sprouting up everywhere. At the same time, many cities reported the loss of Protestant congregations. They would have to face this challenge or perish.

Preaching for Politics

Out of this concern grew the social gospel movement. Progressive-minded preachers began to tie the teachings of the church with contemporary problems. Christian virtue, they declared, demanded a redress of poverty and despair on earth.

Many ministers became politically active. WASHINGTON GLADDEN, the most prominent of the social gospel ministers, supported the workers' right to strike in the wake of the Great Upheaval of 1877. Ministers called for an end to child labor, the enactment of temperance laws, and civil service reform.

Liberal churches such as the CONGREGATIONALISTS and the UNITARIANS led the way, but the movement spread to many sects. Middle class women became particularly active in the arena of social reform.


The Third Great Awakening

The changes were profound. Many historians call this period in the history of American religion the THIRD GREAT AWAKENING. Like the first two awakenings, it was characterized by revival and reform. The temperance movement and the settlement house movement were both affected by church activism. The chief difference between this movement and those of an earlier era was location. These changes in religion transpired because of urban realities, underscoring the social impact of the new American city.

=== Western Folkways


When the Native Americans were placed on reservations, one of the last barriers to western expansion was lifted. The railroad could get people where they wanted to go, and the resources of the West seemed boundless.

How did the typical Westerner make a living? Although migrant settlers had skills too numerous to mention, the most dominant Western industries were mining, ranching, and farming.



Eastern industry required lead and other precious metals. The inventions of the telephone, light bulb, and DYNAMO (a massive generator that could pump electricity directly into people's homes) all required copper wiring. New mining techniques presented the possibility for large-scale industry to provide these necessary ores. Life in the western mining towns contributed much to the legendary lore of the American West.

Demand for beef soared after the Civil War. Learning from the Spanish Mexican tradition, cattle ranchers sought their fortunes in Southern Texas. The archetypal American cowboy was needed between 1866 and 1889 to move the steer to market. Life on the open prairies became a reality for thousands of cowhands during the American cattle boom.


==== Bonanza

BONANZA! That was the exclamation when a large vein of valuable ore was discovered. Thousands of optimistic Americans and even a few foreigners dreamed of finding a bonanza and retiring at a very young age.

Ten years after the 1849 CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH, new deposits were gradually found throughout the West. Colorado yielded gold and silver at PIKES PEAK in 1859 and LEADVILLE IN 1873. NEVADA claimed COMSTOCK LODE, the largest of American silver strikes.

From COEUR D'ALENE in Idaho to TOMBSTONE in Arizona, BOOM TOWNS flowered across the American West. They produced not only gold and silver, but zinc, copper, and lead, all essential for the eastern Industrial Revolution. Soon the West was filled with ne'er-do-wells hoping to strike it rich.

Prospecting

Few were so lucky. The chances of an individual prospector finding a valuable lode were slim indeed. The gold-seeker often worked in a stream bed. A tin pan was filled with sediment and water. After shaking, the heavier gold nuggets would sink to the bottom. Rarely was anything found of substantial size.



Once the loose chunks of gold were removed from the surface, large machinery was required to dig into the earth and to split the quartz where the elusive gold was often hidden. This was too large of an operation for an individual prospector. Eastern investors conducted these ventures and often profited handsomely. The best case scenario for the prospector was to locate a large deposit and sell the claim. Those who were not as lucky often eventually went to work in the mines of the Eastern financiers.

WESTERN MINING wrought havoc on the local environment. Rock dust from drilling was often dumped into river beds, forming silt deposits downstream that flooded towns and farmlands. Miners and farmers were often at loggerheads over the effects of one enterprise on the other. Poisonous underground gases, mostly containing sulfur, were released into the atmosphere. Removing gold from quartz required mercury, the excess of which polluted local streams and rivers. Strip mining caused erosion and further desertification. Little was done to regulate the mining industry until the turn of the 20th century.

Life in a Mining Town


Each mining bonanza required a town. Many towns had as high as a 9-to-1 male-to-female ratio. The ethnic diversity was great. Mexican immigrants were common. Native Americans avoided the mining industry, but mestizos, the offspring of Mexican and Native American parents, often participated. Many African Americans aspired to the same get-rich-quick idea as whites. Until excluded by federal law in 1882, Chinese Americans were numerous in mining towns.

The ethnic patchwork was intricate, but the socio-economic ladder was clearly defined. Whites owned and managed all of the mines. Poor whites, Mexicans and Chinese Americans worked the mine shafts. A few African Americans joined them, but many worked in the service sector as cooks or artisans.

It is these mining towns that often conjure images of the mythical American Wild West. Most did have a saloon (or several) with swinging doors and a player piano. But miners and prospectors worked all day; few had the luxury of spending it at the bar. By nighttime, most were too tired to carouse. Weekends might bring folks out to the saloon for gambling or drinking, to engage in the occasional bar fight, or even to hire a prostitute.

Law enforcement was crude. Many towns could not afford a sheriff, so vigilante justice prevailed. Occasionally a posse, or hunting party, would be raised to capture a particularly nettlesome miscreant.

When the bonanza was at its zenith, the town prospered. But eventually the mines were exhausted or proved fruitless. Slowly its inhabitants would leave, leaving behind nothing but a ghost town.


'''

==== The Ways of the Cowboy

Mining was not the only bonanza to be found in the West. Millions could be made in the CATTLE INDUSTRY. A calf bought for $5 in Southern Texas might sell for $60 in Chicago. The problem was, of course, getting the cattle to market.


Myth vs. Reality

Americans did not invent cattle raising. This tradition was learned from the vaquero, a Mexican cowboy. The vacqueros taught the tricks of the trade to the Texans, who realized the potential for great profits.

The typical COWBOY wore a hat with a wide brim to provide protection from the unforgiving sunlight. Cattle kicked up clouds of dust on the drive, so the cowboy donned a bandanna over the lower half of his face. CHAPS, or leggings, and high boots were worn as protection from briars and cactus needles.

Contrary to legend, the typical cowboy was not a skilled marksman. The lariat, not the gun, was how the cattle drover showed his mastery. About a quarter of all cowboys were African Americans, and even more were at least partially Mexican. To avoid additional strain on the horses, cowboys were usually smaller than according to legend.

The lone cowboy is an American myth. Cattle were always driven by a group of DROVERS. The cattle were branded so the owner could distinguish his STEER from the rest. Several times per DRIVE, cowboys conducted a roundup where the cattle would be sorted and counted again.

Work was very difficult. The workdays lasted fifteen hours, much of which was spent in the saddle. Occasionally, shots were fired by hostile Indians or farmers. Cattle RUSTLERS sometimes stole their steers.

One of the greatest fears was the STAMPEDE, which could result in lost or dead cattle or cowboys. One method of containing a stampede was to get the cattle to run in a circle, where the steer would eventually tire.

Upon reaching Abilene, the cattle were sold. Then it was time to let loose. Abilene had twenty-five saloons open all hours to service incoming riders of the long drive.

Twilight of the Cowboy

The heyday of the long drive was short. By the early 1870s, rail lines reached Texas so the cattle could be shipped directly to the slaughterhouses. Ranchers then began to allow cattle to graze on the open range near rail heads. But even this did not last. The invention of BARBED WIRE by JOSEPH GLIDDEN ruined the OPEN RANGE. Now farmers could cheaply mark their territory to keep the unwanted steers off their lands. Overproduction caused prices to fall, leading many ranchers out of business.

'''

==== Life on the Farm


A homestead at last! Many eastern families who longed for the opportunity to own and farm a plot of land of their own were able to realize their dreams when Congress passed the HOMESTEAD ACT in 1862. That landmark piece of legislation provided 160 acres free to any family who lived on the land for five years and made improvements. The same amount could be obtained instantly for the paltry sum of $1.25 per acre.



There were tremendous economic difficulties associated with Western farm life. First and foremost was overproduction. Because the amount of land under cultivation increased dramatically and new farming techniques produced greater and greater yields, the food market became so flooded with goods that prices fell sharply. While this might be great for the consumer, the farmer had to grow a tremendous amount of food to recoup enough profits to survive the winter.



New machinery and fertilizer was needed to farm on a large scale. Often farmers borrowed money to purchase this equipment, leaving themselves hopelessly in debt when the harvest came. The high tariff forced them to pay higher prices for household goods for their families, while the goods they themselves sold were unprotected.

The railroads also fleeced the small farmer. Farmers were often charged higher rates to ship their goods a short distance than a manufacturer would pay to transport wares a great distance.


Farmers lacked political power. Washington was a long way from the Great Plains, and politicians seemed to turn deaf ears to the farmers' cries. Social problems were also prevalent. With each neighbor on 160-acre plots of land, communication was difficult and loneliness was widespread.


'''

==== The Growth of Populism

Organization was inevitable. Like the oppressed laboring classes of the East, it was only a matter of time before Western farmers would attempt to use their numbers to effect positive change.

Farmers Organize

In 1867, the first such national organization was formed. Led by OLIVER KELLEY, the PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY, also known as the GRANGE, organized to address the social isolation of farm life. Like other SECRET SOCIETIES, such as the MASONS, GRANGERS had local chapters with secret passwords and rituals.

By 1874, several states passed the GRANGER LAWS, establishing maximum shipping rates. Grangers also pooled their resources to buy grain elevators of their own so that members could enjoy a break on grain storage.
