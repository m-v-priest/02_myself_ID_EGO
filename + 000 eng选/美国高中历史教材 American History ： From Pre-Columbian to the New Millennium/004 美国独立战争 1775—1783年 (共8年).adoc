On June 7, 1776, RICHARD HENRY LEE introduced a resolution to the Congress that declared the thirteen colonies "free and independent states." Congress did not act on the resolution immediately. A vote was set for early July. In the meantime it seemed appropriate that some sort of explanation was in order for such a bold act. A subcommittee of five, including Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and THOMAS JEFFERSON, was selected to choose the careful wording.
1776 年 6 月 7 日，理查德·亨利·李向国会提出一项决议，宣布十三个殖民地为“自由独立国家”。国会没有立即对该决议采取行动。投票定于七月初进行。与此同时，对如此大胆的举动进行某种解释似乎是适当的。包括本杰明·富兰克林、约翰·亚当斯和托马斯·杰斐逊在内的五人小组委员会被选中来仔细选择措辞。

The declaration is divided into three main parts. The first was a simple statement of intent. Jefferson's words echo down through the decades of American life until the present day. Phrases like "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL," "unalienable rights," and "life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness" have bounced from the lips of Americans in grammar school and retirement. All are contained in the first section that outlines the basic principles of the enlightened leaders. The next section is a list of grievances; that is, why the colonies deemed independence appropriate. King George was guilty of "repeated injuries" that intended to establish "ABSOLUTE TYRANNY" in North America. He has "plundered our seas, burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people." It was difficult for Americans to argue his points. The concluding paragraph officially dissolves ties with Britain. It also shows modern readers the courage taken by each delegate who would sign. They were now officially guilty of treason and would hang in the gallows if taken before a royal court. Thus, they would "pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor."
声明分为三个主要部分。第一个是简单的意向声明。杰斐逊的话在美国几十年的生活中回响，直到今天。 “人人生而平等”、“不可剥夺的权利”和“生命、自由和追求幸福”等短语在文法学校和退休后的美国人口中不断出现。所有内容都包含在第一部分中，概述了开明领导人的基本原则。下一部分是申诉清单；这就是为什么殖民地认为独立是适当的。乔治国王犯有“屡次伤害”罪，意图在北美建立“绝对暴政”。他“掠夺了我们的海洋，烧毁了我们的城镇，摧毁了我们人民的生活”。美国人很难反驳他的观点。最后一段正式解除与英国的关系。它还向现代读者展示了每位签名代表所具有的勇气。他们现在被正式犯有叛国罪，如果被带到皇家法庭，他们将被绞死在绞刑架上。因此，他们将“互相保证我们的生命、我们的财富和我们神圣的荣誉”。


Debate in the Congress followed. Jefferson watched painfully as the other delegates tweaked his prose. Jefferson had wanted to include a passage blaming the king for the slave trade, for example, but the southern delegates insisted upon its removal. Finally on July 4, 1776, the colonies approved the document. The vote was twelve to zero, with the New York delegation abstaining. As president of the Congress, John Hancock scrawled his famous signature across the bottom and history was made. If the American effort was successful, they would be hailed as heroes. If it failed, they would be hanged as traitors.
接下来是国会的辩论。杰斐逊痛苦地看着其他代表修改他的散文。例如，杰斐逊曾想加入一段指责国王从事奴隶贸易的段落，但南方代表坚持将其删除。最终，1776 年 7 月 4 日，殖民地批准了该文件。投票结果为十二比零，纽约代表团弃权。作为国会主席，约翰·汉考克在底部潦草地写下了他著名的签名，历史就此被创造。如果美国的努力成功，他们将被誉为英雄。如果失败，他们将被当作叛徒绞死。






Americans faced seemingly impossible obstacles. When the guns fired at Lexington and Concord in 1775, there was not yet even a Continental Army. Those battles were fought by local militias. Few Americans had any military experience, and there was no method of training, supplying, or paying an army.
美国人面临着看似不可能的障碍。 1775 年，当炮火向列克星敦和康科德开火时，当时甚至还没有一支大陆军。这些战斗是由当地民兵进行的。很少有美国人有军事经验，也没有训练、补给或支付军队费用的方法。

Moreover, a majority of Americans opposed the war in 1775. Many historians believe only about a third of all Americans supported a war against the British at that time.
此外，大多数美国人反对 1775 年的战争。许多历史学家认为，当时只有大约三分之一的美国人支持对英国发动战争。

Further, the Colonies had a poor track record of working together.
此外，殖民地之间的合作记录不佳。

How, then, could a ragtag group of patriots defeat the British?
那么，一群乌合之众的爱国者如何能够击败英国人呢？

The early stages of war, in 1775, can be best described as British military victories and American moral triumphs.
1775 年战争的早期阶段可以用英国的军事胜利和美国的道德胜利来形容。


Regardless, by 1777 the British occupied Philadelphia, the seat of the Continental Congress, and sent that body into hiding. The British also controlled New York City and pretty much had their way in the waters along the Eastern Seaboard. In fact, there was no Continental Navy to speak of at this time. Meanwhile, the British began mounting a southward attack from Canada into upstate New York. This threatened to cut New England off from the rest of the Colonies.
不管怎样，到 1777 年，英国占领了大陆会议所在地费城，并将会议机构藏了起来。英国人还控制了纽约市，并在东海岸沿线的水域中占据了很大的份额。事实上，此时还没有大陆海军可言。与此同时，英国人开始从加拿大向南进攻纽约州北部。这有可能切断新英格兰与其他殖民地的联系。

The Battle of Saratoga, in northern New York, served as a critical turning point. The British attempt to capture the Hudson River Valley ended with their surrender to General Horatio Gates in October. Washington, having lost Philadelphia, led his troops to Valley Forge to spend the winter. None of the world's powers had come to the aid of the patriot cause — yet.
纽约北部的萨拉托加战役是一个关键的转折点。英国占领哈德逊河谷的企图以十月向霍雷肖·盖茨将军投降而告终。失去费城后，华盛顿率军前往福吉谷过冬。目前为止，世界上还没有任何一个国家对爱国事业提供援助。

In early 1778, the French agreed to recognize American independence and formed a permanent alliance with the new nation. Military help and sizable stores of much-needed gunpowder soon arrived. The tide was beginning to turn.
1778 年初，法国同意承认美国独立，并与这个新国家结成永久联盟。军事援助和大量急需的火药储备很快就到达了。潮流开始转变。


The British grew increasingly frustrated. The loss at Saratoga was humiliating. Capturing the enemy's capital, Philadelphia, did not bring them much advantage. As long as the American Continental Army and state militias remained in the field, the British had to keep on fighting.
英国人越来越沮丧。萨拉托加的失利是一种耻辱。攻占敌人的首都费城并没有给他们带来多少优势。只要美国大陆军和州民兵仍在战场上，英国人就必须继续战斗。


Having failed in the north, the British turned their attention to the south. They hoped to inspire Loyalist support among dissatisfied Americans — a hope that was never realized. Fighting continued. The threat of French naval participation kept the British uneasy.
在北方失败后，英国人将注意力转向南方。他们希望激发不满的美国人对效忠派的支持——这一希望从未实现。战斗仍在继续。法国海军参与的威胁让英国感到不安。

In October 1781, the war virtually came to an end when General Cornwallis was surrounded and forced to surrender the British position at Yorktown, Virginia. Two years later, the Treaty of Paris made it official: America was independent.
1781 年 10 月，当康沃利斯将军被包围并被迫交出位于弗吉尼亚州约克镇的英国阵地时，战争实际上已经结束。两年后，《巴黎条约》正式宣布：美国独立。

It is impossible to know the exact number of American colonists who favored or opposed independence.
我们不可能知道支持或反对独立的美国殖民者的确切人数。

For years it was widely believed that one third favored the Revolution, one third opposed it, and one third were undecided. This stems from an estimate made by John Adams in his personal writings in 1815.
多年来，人们普遍认为三分之一的人支持革命，三分之一的人反对革命，还有三分之一的人尚未做出决定。这源于约翰·亚当斯 1815 年在其个人著作中做出的估计。

Historians have since concluded that Adams was referring to American attitudes toward the French Revolution, not ours. The current thought is that about 20 percent of the colonists were LOYALISTS — those whose remained loyal to England and King George. Another small group in terms of percentage were the dedicated PATRIOTS, for whom there was no alternative but independence.
此后历史学家得出的结论是，亚当斯指的是美国人对法国大革命的态度，而不是我们的态度。目前的观点是，大约 20% 的殖民者是保皇派——那些仍然忠于英格兰和乔治国王的人。从百分比来看，另一个小群体是忠诚的爱国者，他们除了独立别无选择。

Often overlooked are the fence-sitters who made up the largest group.
经常被忽视的是构成最大群体的中立派。

With so many Americans undecided, the war became in great measure a battle to win popular support. If the patriots could succeed in selling their ideas of revolution to the public, then popular support might follow and the British would be doomed.
由于如此多的美国人犹豫不决，战争在很大程度上变成了一场赢得民众支持的战争。如果爱国者能够成功地向公众推销他们的革命思想，那么民众的支持可能会随之而来，而英国人将注定失败。

Even with military victory, it would have been impossible for the Crown to regain the allegiance of the people. Revolution would merely flare up at a later date.
即使取得了军事上的胜利，英国国王也不可能重新获得美国人民的效忠。殖民地的革命只会在晚些时候爆发。

In the long run, however, the patriots were much more successful attracting support. American patriots won the war of propaganda. Committees of Correspondence persuaded many fence-sitters to join the patriot cause.
然而，从长远来看，爱国者队更成功地吸引了支持。美国爱国者赢得了宣传战。通讯委员会说服了许多中立者加入爱国事业。


Patriots subjected Loyalists to public humiliation and violence. Many Loyalists found their property vandalized, looted, and burned. The patriots controlled public discourse. Woe to the citizen who publicly proclaimed sympathy to Britain.
爱国者让效忠派遭受公开羞辱和暴力。许多效忠派发现他们的财产遭到破坏、抢劫和焚烧。爱国者控制了公众话语。公开表示同情英国的公民有祸了。

In the end, many Loyalists simply left America. About 80,000 of them fled to Canada or Britain during or just after the war. Because Loyalists were often wealthy, educated, older, and Anglican, the American social fabric was altered by their departure. American history brands them as traitors. But most were just trying to maintain the lifestyles to which they had become accustomed. After all, history is always written by the winners.
最终，许多效忠派干脆离开了美国。其中约 80,000 人在战争期间或战争结束后逃往加拿大或英国。由于效忠派通常富有、受过教育、年龄较大并且是英国圣公会教徒，因此美国的社会结构因他们的离开而发生了改变。美国历史将他们标记为叛徒。但大多数人只是试图维持他们已经习惯的生活方式。毕竟，历史总是由胜利者书写的。

As the British entered major cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, many people fled to the countryside, looking for food and work. Traditional markets were disrupted. Farmers who one week sold their wares to their usual American customers might the next week be selling to an occupying British army.
战争期间, 随着英国人进入波士顿、费城和纽约等主要城市，许多人逃到乡村寻找食物和工作。传统市场被扰乱。一周将商品卖给他们通常的美国客户的农民可能会在下周卖给一支占领的英国军队。


The BRITISH BLOCKADE caused widespread UNEMPLOYMENT. Almost anyone dependent on the foreign market was out of work, from shippers to merchants. Both armies were sometimes followed by men and women willing to work in any way for a hot meal. The Colonial economy was in shambles.
英国的封锁造成了广泛的失业。从托运人到商人，几乎所有依赖国外市场的人都失业了。两支军队有时都会跟着愿意以任何方式工作的男男女女，只为了吃一顿热饭。殖民地经济一片混乱。

Some farmers and merchants hoped to profit from increased prices due to scarcity. Many sold their wares to the British army. Violence sometimes came in the wake of rising prices, and the Continental Congress enacted regulations to counter inflation throughout the Colonies.
一些农民和商人希望从稀缺性涨价中获利。许多人将他们的商品卖给英国军队。物价上涨有时会引发暴力，大陆会议颁布法规来对抗整个殖民地的通货膨胀。

When the men went off to fight in the war, American women, children, and elderly were frequently faced with the occupation of their houses, churches, and government buildings by British soldiers.
当男人们去参战时，美国妇女、儿童和老人经常面临着英国士兵占领他们的房屋、教堂和政府大楼的情况。

Women stepped forth to fill holes left by fighting Continental soldiers. Women needed to perform tasks formerly reserved for their husbands (such as farming or running businesses).
妇女们挺身而出，填补了与大陆士兵作战时留下的漏洞。妇女需要执行以前留给丈夫的任务（例如务农或经营企业）。


Many men would have returned to bankruptcy after the war had it not been for the efforts of their spouses.
如果没有他们配偶的努力，许多男人在战后可能会再次破产。


American spirits reached a low point during the harsh winter of 1777-78.
1777-78 年的严冬期间，美国人的精神达到了最低点。

British troops had marched triumphantly into Philadelphia the previous autumn. Philadelphia was the largest city in the Colonies and the seat of political power. After the British swept into Philadelphia, the Continental Congress had flee to west, first to Lancaster then to York.
去年秋天，英国军队胜利进军费城。费城是殖民地最大的城市和政治权力所在地。英国人席卷费城后，大陆会议逃往西部，先是兰开斯特，然后又逃到约克。


Washington's army had spent the summer of 1777 fighting a string of losing battles. The Americans harassed the British army in skirmishes and minor battles for much of the fighting season. In the fall, the Americans showed pluck at the BATTLE OF BRANDYWINE in September and the BATTLE OF GERMANTOWN in October. Yet the Americans were unable to keep the British out of Philadelphia.
1777 年夏天，华盛顿的军队经历了一系列失败的战斗。在战斗季节的大部分时间里，美国人都在小规模冲突和小规模战斗中骚扰英军。秋天，美国人在 9 月的布兰迪万战役和 10 月的日耳曼敦战役中表现出了勇气。然而美国人无法阻止英国人进入费城。

In December, Washington marched his tired, beaten, hungry and sick army to VALLEY FORGE, a location about 20 miles northwest of British-occupied Philadelphia. From Valley Forge, Washington could keep an eye on General Howe's British army ensconced in Philadelphia.
12 月，华盛顿率领他疲惫不堪、挨打、饥饿、患病的军队前往福吉谷，该地点位于英占费城西北约 20 英里处。从福吉谷，华盛顿可以监视豪将军驻扎在费城的英国军队。

At Valley Forge, there were shortages of everything from food to clothing to medicine. Washington's men were sick from disease, hunger, and exposure. The Continental Army camped in crude LOG CABINS and endured cold conditions while the Redcoats warmed themselves in colonial homes. The patriots went hungry while the British soldiers ate well.
在福吉谷，从食物到衣服再到药品，一切都短缺。华盛顿的士兵们因疾病、饥饿和暴露而患病。大陆军在简陋的小木屋里扎营，忍受着寒冷的天气，而英国士兵则在殖民地房屋中取暖。爱国者挨饿，英国士兵却吃得饱饱的。

Terms of enlistment were ending for many soldiers in Washington's army. The General wondered if he would even have an army left when the spring thaw finally arrived.
华盛顿军队的许多士兵的入伍期限即将结束。将军想知道，当春天解冻最终到来时，他是否还能留下一支军队。

General Washington was upset that local farmers were hoarding much-needed food waiting to earn higher profits in the spring. Some farmers even sneaked grain into Philadelphia to feed the British army, who paid in gold or silver. With each passing night came more desertions. Washington grew privately disgusted at the lack of commitment of his so-called patriot fighters.
华盛顿将军对当地农民囤积急需的粮食等待春季赚取更高利润感到不安。一些农民甚至偷偷地将谷物运到费城来喂养英国军队，而英国军队则用黄金或白银支付费用。每过一夜，就会有更多的逃兵。华盛顿私下里对他所谓的爱国战士缺乏承诺感到厌恶。

Then there was the grumbling of some in Congress and among some of Washington's own officers. Washington's leadership skills were openly questioned. Many said General Horatio Gates was better-suited to leading the army. After all, hadn't he scored a major victory in October at the battle of Saratoga.? Within the environment of cold, deprivation, and rebellion, how long could Washington and his army endure?
随后国会中的一些人和华盛顿自己的一些官员也开始抱怨。华盛顿的领导能力受到公开质疑。许多人说霍雷肖·盖茨将军更适合领导军队。毕竟，他不是在十月的萨拉托加战役中取得了重大胜利吗？在寒冷、匮乏、叛乱的环境下，华盛顿和他的军队还能坚持多久？


Over the course of the winter, the weather improved somewhat. Food trickled in from the surrounding countryside. Many wives of soldiers spent time at Valley Forge over the winter. Washington was able to quash those who questioned his leadership abilities.
入冬以来，天气有所好转。食物从周围的乡村源源不断地运来。许多士兵的妻子在福吉谷度过了冬天。华盛顿能够平息那些质疑他领导能力的人。

The Continental Army encamped at Valley Forge in the fall of 1777 with about 12,000 men in its ranks. Death claimed about a quarter of them before spring arrived. Another thousand didn't reenlist or deserted. But the army that remained was stronger. They were fewer, but more disciplined. They were weary, but firmly resolved.
1777 年秋天，大陆军在福吉谷扎营，约有 12,000 人。在春天到来之前，大约四分之一的人死亡。还有一千人没有重新入伍或开小差。但留下来的军队更加强大。他们人数较少，但纪律更加严明。他们很疲倦，但决心坚定。

The next year, 1778, brought greater fortune to the American cause. While Washington froze at Valley Forge, Benjamin Franklin was busy securing the French alliance. Now the war would be different indeed.
第二年，即 1778 年，美国事业迎来了更大的命运。当华盛顿在福吉谷僵住时，本杰明·富兰克林正忙于确保与法国的联盟。现在战争确实会有所不同。

The BATTLE OF SARATOGA was the turning point of the Revolutionary War.
萨拉托加战役是独立战争的转折点。


A stupendous American victory in October 1777, the success at Saratoga gave France the confidence in the American cause to enter the war as an American ALLY. Later American successes owed a great deal to French aid in the form of financial and military assistance.
1777 年 10 月，美国取得了惊人的胜利，萨拉托加的胜利让法国对美国的事业充满信心，作为美国的盟友参战。美国后来的成功在很大程度上要归功于法国的财政和军事援助。

As early as 1774, VERGENNES, the French foreign minister, had sent secret emissaries to explore the American colonists' commitment to independence. In the spring of 1776, Congress dispatched SILAS DEANE to France as a secret commercial agent to see if he could make arrangements for the purchase of military supplies on terms of credit. Deane also made inquiries into possible French political and even military assistance.
早在1774年，法国外交部长维尔根尼斯就派出秘密使者，探寻美洲殖民者对独立的承诺。 1776 年春，国会派遣西拉斯·迪恩 (SILAS DEANE) 作为秘密商业代理人前往法国，看看他是否可以安排以信贷方式购买军事物资。迪恩还询问了法国可能提供的政治甚至军事援助。

Watchful waiting by French diplomacy came to an end when the news of the surrender of Burgoyne's army at Saratoga reached Paris on December 4, 1777. Two FRANCO-AMERICAN TREATIES were rapidly concluded. The first was a treaty of amity and commerce, which bestowed most-favored nation trading privileges and also contained cooperative maritime provisions.
1777 年 12 月 4 日，当伯戈因军队在萨拉托加投降的消息传到巴黎时，法国外交的警惕等待结束了。两项法美条约迅速缔结。第一个是友好通商条约，赋予最惠国贸易特权，并包含海事合作条款。

The second was a treaty of "CONDITIONAL AND DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE." It provided, among other things, that in case war should break out between France and Great Britain as a result of the first treaty, France and America should fight the war together, and neither would make a peace or truce with the enemy without the formal consent of the other. Nor would they "lay down their arms until the Independence of the united states shall have been formally or tacitly assured by the Treaty or Treaties that shall terminate the War."
第二个是“有条件的防御性联盟”条约。除其他外，它规定，如果法国和英国因第一个条约而爆发战争，法国和美国应共同作战，并且在没有正式条约的情况下，双方都不会与敌人缔结和平或休战协议。对方的同意。他们也不会“放下武器，直到美国的独立得到终止战争的条约的正式或默示保证”。


Although the American military was still enduring losses in 1780, the French were making a difference. The French navy was disrupting the British blockade.
尽管美国军队在 1780 年仍然遭受损失，但法国军队正在扭转局面。法国海军正在破坏英国的封锁。

Although, the British occupied much of the south, they had still been unable to mobilize the local Loyalists. Grumbling in England grew louder over the war's expense and duration. The morale of Washington's men was improving. The war was by no means over, but the general could now see a bright side.
尽管英国占领了南部大部分地区，但他们仍然无法动员当地的保皇派。英国国内对战争费用和持续时间的抱怨越来越大。华盛顿士兵的士气正在提高。战争还没有结束，但将军现在看到了光明的一面。

the Battle of Yorktown turned the British public against the war. The following March, a pro-American Parliament was elected and peace negotiations began in earnest.
约克镇之战使英国公众开始反对战争。次年三月，亲美议会当选，和平谈判正式开始。


Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and JOHN JAY met with the British in the hopes of securing a peace treaty.
本杰明·富兰克林、约翰·亚当斯和约翰·杰伊与英国人会面，希望达成和平条约。

In the 1783 TREATY OF PARIS the British agreed to recognize American independence as far west as the Mississippi River. Americans agreed to honor debts owed to British merchants from before the war and to stop persecuting British Loyalists.
在 1783 年《巴黎条约》中，英国同意承认美国独立，远至密西西比河以西。美国人同意偿还战前欠英国商人的债务，并停止迫害英国保皇派。

David had triumphed over Goliath. Independence was achieved at last!
大卫战胜了歌利亚。终于实现独立了！
