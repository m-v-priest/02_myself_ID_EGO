=== America in the Second World War 第二次世界大战中的美国

For the second time in the 20th century, the United States became involved in a devastating world conflict.
美国在20世纪, 第二次卷入毁灭性的世界冲突。

The mobilization effort of the government in WORLD WAR II eclipsed even that of World War I. With major operations in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, American industries literally fueled two wars simultaneously. The social and economic consequences were profound. The GREAT MIGRATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS from the rural South to the industrial North was accelerated. New opportunities opened for women. Americans finally enjoyed a standard of living higher than the pre-Depression years.
**政府在第二次世界大战中的动员力度, 甚至超过了第一次世界大战。**美国工业在大西洋和太平洋战区, 都有重要行动，实际上同时助长了两场战争。**社会和经济后果是深远的。**非裔美国人从南方农村向北方工业大迁徙的速度加快。*为女性带来了新的机遇。美国人终于享受到了比大萧条前更高的生活水平。*

But the war effort also had a darker side. Civil liberties were compromised, particularly for the 110,000 Japanese Americans who were forcibly uprooted from their West Coast homes to be sent to remote relocation camps.
**但战争努力, 也有阴暗的一面。公民自由受到损害，**尤其是 110,000 名日裔美国人，他们被强行从西海岸的家园连根拔起，送往偏远的安置营。



In both Europe and Asia, the Axis powers had established a firm foothold prior to American entry into the conflict. Slowly, but surely the Allies closed the ring on Nazi Germany after turning points at El Alamein and STALINGRAD. Once Italy quit the Axis and the Allies landed successfully at NORMANDY, it was only a matter of time before the Nazi machine was smashed. Similar failures marked the early war in the Pacific, as the Japanese captured the Philippines. But once Japanese offensive capabilities were damaged at Midway, the United States "ISLAND HOPPED" its way to the Japanese mainland.
在欧洲和亚洲，轴心国在美国介入冲突之前, 就已经站稳了脚跟。在阿拉曼和斯大林格勒的转折点之后，盟军缓慢但坚定地关闭上了对纳粹德国的包围圈。一旦意大利退出轴心国、盟军成功登陆诺曼底，纳粹机器被粉碎只是时间问题。类似的失败标志着太平洋战争的早期，日本占领了菲律宾。但一旦日本的进攻能力在中途岛遭到破坏，美国就“跳岛”前往日本本土。

.阿拉曼战役
是第二次世界大战中"北非战场"的转折点。这次战役从1942年10月23日一直持续到11月3日。**盟军在阿拉曼的胜利, 致使意大利和德国欲占领埃及、控制苏伊士运河, 及中东油田的希望破灭。**这次战役结束了非洲装甲集团军的攻势，**此场战役后, 轴心国于北非战场转入战略撤退。**

*"阿拉曼战役"与同时期的"斯大林格勒战役"与"瓜达康纳尔战役", 成为同盟国进入"战略反攻阶段"的开始。*

.Suez Canal 苏伊士运河

全长约164公里. 这条运河连结了欧洲与亚洲之间的南北双向水运，船只不必绕过非洲南端的"好望角"，大大节省航程。

运河当前由埃及的苏伊士运河管理局拥有和管理。*由于位置极具战略价值，根据君士坦丁堡公约，“运河在战时也可像和平时期一样，任何商用及军用船只均可使用，而无需悬挂区别旗帜。”*

法兰西第二殖民帝国, 因为美洲的殖民地被英国所夺，所以重点向东方发展。打通"苏伊士运河"对法国意义更为重大。运河于1869年11月17日通航。

New technologies emerged during the war as well. RADAR helped the British locate incoming German planes, and SONAR made SUBMARINE detection much more feasible. GERMAN V-1 AND V-2 ROCKETS ushered in a new age of long-range warfare. But no weapon compared in destructive capacity to the atomic bomb, developed after a massive, secret research project spearheaded by the United States government.
战争期间也出现了新技术。"雷达"帮助英国定位来袭的德国飞机，"声纳"使潜艇探测变得更加可行。德国 V-1 和 V-2 火箭弹, 开创了远程战争的新时代。但没有任何一种武器的破坏力可以与原子弹相比，原子弹是在美国政府牵头的大规模秘密研究项目后开发出来的。

World War II was fought over differences left unresolved after World War I. Over 400,000 Americans perished in the four years of involvement, an American death rate second only to the Civil War. Twelve million victims perished from Nazi atrocities in the HOLOCAUST. The deaths of twenty million Russians created a defensive Soviet mindset that spilled into the postwar era. After all the blood and sacrifice, the Axis powers were defeated, but the GRAND ALLIANCE that emerged victorious did not last long. Soon the world was involved in a 45-year struggle that claimed millions of additional lives — the Cold War.
**第二次世界大战, 是因第一次世界大战后未解决的分歧而爆发的。四年来，超过 40 万美国人丧生，美国死亡率仅次于内战。**一千二百万受害者死于纳粹大屠杀的暴行。两千万俄罗斯人的死亡, 创造了苏联的防御心态，这种心态一直蔓延到战后时代。经过所有的鲜血和牺牲，轴心国被击败，但胜利的大联盟并没有持续多久。很快，世界就卷入了一场长达 45 年的斗争，夺走了数百万人的生命——冷战。

====  Wartime Strategy 51a.战时策略


Three days after Congress declared war on Japan, Germany responded by declaring war on the United States.
*国会对日本宣战三天后，德国也对美国宣战。*

Japan had an advance pledge of support from Hitler in the event of war with the United States. Now President Roosevelt faced a two-ocean war — a true world war. Despite widespread cries for revenge against Japan, the first major decision made by the President was to concentrate on Germany first. The American Pacific Fleet would do its best to contain Japanese expansion, while emphasis was placed on confronting Hitler's troops.
日本事先得到希特勒的保证，一旦日本与美国发生战争，德国将给予支持。现在罗斯福总统面临着一场两洋战争——一场真正的世界大战。尽管人们普遍呼吁报复日本，但**总统做出的第一个重大决定就是, 首先集中精力对付德国。美国"太平洋舰队"将尽力遏制日本的扩张，同时美国的重点放在对抗希特勒的军队。**



Roosevelt believed that a Nazi-dominated Europe would be far more impregnable that any defenses Japan could build in the Pacific. American scientists worried that, with enough time, German scientists might develop weapons of mass destruction. Once Hitler was defeated, the combined Allied forces would concentrate on smashing Japanese ambitions.
*罗斯福认为，纳粹统治的欧洲, 将比日本在太平洋建立的任何防御都要坚不可摧。美国科学家担心，如果有足够的时间，德国科学家可能会研制出大规模杀伤性武器。一旦击败希特勒，盟军将集中力量粉碎日本的野心。*

American military leaders favored a far more aggressive approach to attacking Germany than their British counterparts. A cross-channel invasion of France from Britain would strike at the heart of Nazi strength, but the British command was dubious. Winston Churchill feared that should such an operation fail, the loss of human life, military resources, and British morale could be fatal.
美国军事领导人, 倾向于采取比英国军事领导人更加激进的方式, 来攻击德国。英国对法国的跨海峡入侵, 将打击纳粹的核心力量，但英国的指挥权, 却令人怀疑。温斯顿·丘吉尔担心，如果这样的行动失败，人员伤亡、军事资源和英国士气的损失, 可能是致命的。

Instead, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to implement an immediate blockade of supplies to Germany and to begin bombing German cities and munitions centers. The army would attack Hitler's troops at their weakest points first and slowly advance toward German soil. The plan was known as "CLOSING THE RING." In December 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to attack German holdings in North Africa first.
*替代的，罗斯福和丘吉尔同意, 立即封锁对德国的物资供应，并开始轰炸德国的城市和弹药中心。军队将首先攻击希特勒的部队最薄弱的地方，然后慢慢向德国领土推进。这个计划被称为“缩紧包围圈”。1941年12月，罗斯福和丘吉尔同意首先攻击德国在北非的据点。*

That maneuver was finally executed in October 1942. Nazi troops were occupying much of the African Mediterranean coast, which had been controlled by France prior to the war. Led by BRITISH GENERAL BERNARD MONTGOMERY, British forces struck at German and Italian troops commanded by the "DESERT FOX," German FIELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL, at EL ALAMEIN in Egypt. As the British forced a German retreat, Anglo-American forces landed on the west coast of Africa on November 8 to stage a simultaneous assault. Rommel fought gamely, but numbers and positioning soon forced a German surrender. The Allies had achieved their first important joint victory.
这一行动最终于 1942 年 10 月实施。纳粹军队占领了战前由法国控制的非洲"地中海沿岸"大部分地区。在英国将军伯纳德·蒙哥马利的率领下，英国军队在埃及阿拉曼, 袭击了由“沙漠之狐”德国陆军元帅埃尔文·隆美尔指挥的德国和意大利军队。**当英国迫使德军撤退时，英美联军于 11 月 8 日在非洲西海岸登陆，**同时发起进攻。虽然隆美尔奋勇作战，但数量和布局, 很快迫使德军投降。盟军取得了他们的第一个重要的联合胜利。

Simultaneously, the Soviets turned the tide against Nazi advances into the Soviet Union by defeating the German forces at Stalingrad. When springtime came in 1943, the Allies had indeed begun to close the ring.
*与此同时，苏联在斯大林格勒击败了德国军队，扭转了纳粹向苏联进军的局面。 1943年春天到来时，盟军确实开始封闭包围圈。*



Once Northern Africa was secured, the Allies took the next step toward Germany by launching invasions of Sicily and Italy. American and British leaders believed that when the Italian people faced occupation of their homeland, they would rise up and overthrow Mussolini. Fearing that the Allies would have a free road up to the border of Austria, German forces began to entrench themselves in Italy.
**一旦北非获得安全，盟军就向德国迈出了下一步，入侵西西里岛和意大利。美国和英国领导人相信，当意大利人民面临祖国被占领时，他们会奋起推翻墨索里尼。**由于担心盟军有一条通往奥地利边境的自由道路，德国军队开始在意大利巩固自己的阵地。

Despite German presence in Italy, Mussolini was arrested and the Italians surrendered to the Allies on September 3. There was no free road to Austria, however. German forces defended the peninsula ferociously, and even when the European war ended in May 1945, the Allies had failed to capture much of Italy.
尽管德国在意大利存在，墨索里尼还是被捕了，意大利人于 9 月 3 日向盟军投降。然而，通往奥地利的道路并不畅通。德国军队顽强地保卫着半岛，*即使 1945 年 5 月欧洲战争结束，盟军也未能占领意大利的大部分地区。*

==== The American Homefront 美国国土安全部

America was the largest military power in the world — in theory.
理论上，美国是世界上最大的军事强国。

The large population, generous natural resources, advanced infrastructure, and solid capital base were all just potential. Centralization and mobilization were necessary to jump-start this unwieldy machine. Within a week of Pearl Harbor, Congress passed the WAR POWERS ACT, granting wide authority to the President to conduct the war effort. Throughout the war hundreds more alphabet agencies were created to manage the American homefront.
*庞大的人口、丰富的自然资源、先进的基础设施, 和雄厚的资本基础, 都只是潜力。要启动这台笨重的机器，必须进行集中化和动员。珍珠港事件发生一周内，国会通过了《战争权力法》，授予总统广泛的权力来开展战争工作。整个战争期间，又成立了数百个字母机构来管理美国后方。*

First the United States needed to enlarge its armed forces. Because of the peacetime draft, the UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES boasted over 1.5 million members. By the end of the war, that number rose to 12 million. A more expansive draft and a vigorous recruitment campaign produced these results. Prodded by ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, FDR created women's auxiliary forces for the army (WACS), navy (WAVES), air force (WASPS), and Coast Guard (SPARS). The colossal ranks of the armed services created a huge labor shortage.
首先，美国需要扩大其武装部队。由于**和平时期的征兵，美国武装部队拥有超过 150 万名成员。到战争结束时，这个数字上升到 1200 万。**更广泛的征兵和强有力的招募活动产生了这些结果。在埃莉诺·罗斯福的推动下，罗斯福为陆军（WACS）、海军（WAVES）、空军（WASPS）和海岸警卫队（SPARS）创建了女性辅助部队。*庞大的军队队伍, 造成了巨大的劳动力短缺。*

Toward this end a "WORK OR FIGHT" propaganda campaign was waged. "ROSIE THE RIVETER" posters beckoned housewives to leave the home and enter the nation's factories. About 6.5 million females entered the workforce during the war years, many for the first time. African Americans continued the Great Migration northward, filling vacated factory jobs. Mexican Americans were courted to cross the border to assist with the harvest season in the BRACERO GUEST-WORKER PROGRAM. Thousands of retirees went back on the job, and more and more teenagers pitched in to fill the demand for new labor.
为此，开展了“工作或战斗”的宣传运动。 “铆工罗西”海报吸引**家庭主妇离开家，进入国家的工厂。**大约 650 万女性在战争年代进入劳动力市场，其中许多是第一次。*非裔美国人继续向北大迁徙，填补工厂空缺的职位。* BRACERO 客工计划邀请墨西哥裔美国人跨越边境, 协助收获季节。*成千上万的退休人员, 重返工作岗位，越来越多的青少年加入进来，以满足对新劳动力的需求。*


The United States government spent over twice as much money fighting World War II as it had spent on all previous programs since its creation. Tax rates were raised to generate revenue and control inflation. Some people paid 90% of what they earned toward taxes!
美国政府在二战中花费的资金, 是其自创建以来, 在所有先前项目上花费的资金的两倍多。**提高税率是为了创造税收收入, 并控制通货膨胀。**有些人将收入的 90% 用来缴税！

Still, more money was needed so the government again launched Liberty and VICTORY LOAN DRIVES like those that helped finance the First World War. In addition, the size of the federal government more than tripled from about a million workers in 1940 to almost 3.5 million in 1945.
**尽管如此，仍然需要更多的资金，因此政府再次启动了"自由和胜利贷款"计划，**就像那些为第一次世界大战提供资金的计划一样。此外，**联邦政府的规模增加了两倍多，**从 1940 年的约 100 万工人增加到 1945 年的近 350 万。

The United States managed to raise enough food and raw materials in the First World War through voluntary measures. This time, federal officials agreed that only through RATIONING could the demands be met. Americans were issued books of stamps for key items such as gasoline, sugar, meat, butter, canned foods, fuel oil, shoes, and rubber. No purchase of these commodities was legal without a stamp. VICTORY SPEED LIMITS attempted to conserve fuel by requiring Americans to drive more slowly. Rotating blackouts conserved fuel to be shipped overseas. Groups such as the Boy Scouts led scrap metal drives. Consumer goods like automobiles and refrigerators simply were not produced. Women drew lines down the backs of their legs to simulate nylon stockings when there were such shortages. Backyard gardens produced about 8 million tons of food.
美国在第一次世界大战中, 通过自愿措施, 筹集了足够的粮食和原材料。这一次，联邦官员同意, 只有通过配给才能满足这些要求。美国人获得了汽油、糖、肉类、黄油、罐头食品、燃油、鞋子和橡胶等关键物品的邮票册。如果没有邮票，购买这些商品就是合法的。胜利限速, 试图通过要求美国人放慢车速, 来节省燃料。**轮流停电, 节省了运往海外的燃料。**童子军等团体领导了废金属运动。**汽车和冰箱等消费品, 根本就没有生产。**当尼龙袜短缺时，妇女们在腿后画线以模仿尼龙袜。后院花园生产了约 800 万吨粮食。

At tremendous cost to the American taxpayer, the American people vanquished two evils: the AXIS POWERS and the Great Depression.
美国人民付出了巨大的代价，美国纳税人战胜了两大罪恶：轴心国和大萧条。

==== D-Day and the German Surrender



The time had finally come. British and American troops had liberated North Africa and pressed on into Italy. Soviet troops had turned the tide at Stalingrad and were slowly reclaiming their territory. The ENGLISH CHANNEL was virtually free of Nazi submarines, and American and British planes were bombing German industrial centers around the clock.
*时机终于到了。英国和美国军队解放了北非, 并向意大利挺进。苏联军队在斯大林格勒扭转了局势，并正在慢慢收复领土。英吉利海峡几乎没有纳粹潜艇存在了，美国和英国的飞机昼夜不停地轰炸德国工业中心。*

Still, Hitler refused to surrender and hid behind his ATLANTIC WALL. Since the outbreak of war, Stalin was demanding an all-out effort to liberate France from German occupation. An invasion force greater than any in the history of the world was slowly amassing in southern Britain toward that end.
尽管如此，希特勒拒绝投降, 并躲在他的大西洋墙后面。战争爆发以来，斯大林要求全力以赴将法国从德国占领下解放出来。为此，一支比世界历史上任何一次都要强大的入侵力量, 正在英国南部慢慢集结。



A great game of espionage soon unfolded. If the Germans could discover when and where the attack would occur, they could simply concentrate all their efforts in one area, and the operation would be doomed to failure. The Allies staged phony exercises meant to confuse German intelligence. Two-dimensional dummy tanks were arranged to distract air surveillance. There was considerable reason to believe the attack would come at CALAIS, where the English Channel is narrowest. In actuality, OPERATION OVERLORD was aiming for the NORMANDY PENINSULA on the morning of June 4, 1944.
一场伟大的间谍游戏很快展开了。如果德国人能发现攻击发生的时间和地点，他们就可以把所有的精力集中在一个地区，而这次盟军的登录行动注定要失败。**盟军进行了虚假的演习，目的是迷惑德国情报部门。**布置二维模拟坦克, 以分散空中监视。有相当多的理由相信，攻击会发生在英吉利海峡最狭窄的"加来"。事实上，“霸王”行动的目标, 是1944年6月4日上午的"诺曼底半岛"。

After D-DAY, the days of the German resistance were numbered. Paris was liberated in August 1944 as the Allies pushed slowly eastward. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was moving into German territory as well. Hitler, at the BATTLE OF THE BULGE, launched a final unsuccessful counteroffensive in December 1944. Soon the Americans, British, and Free French found themselves racing the Soviets to Berlin.
诺曼底登陆之后，德国抵抗的日子就屈指可数了。 1944 年 8 月，随着盟军缓慢向东推进，巴黎获得解放。与此同时，苏联也正在进入德国领土。 1944 年 12 月，希特勒在突出部战役中发动了最后一次反攻，但没有成功。很快，美国、英国和自由法国发现自己正在与苏联争夺柏林。


Following the defeat of the Nazi regime, the full extent of the Holocaust was at last revealed.  Approximately 12,000,000 people were killed between 1933-45.
纳粹政权战败后，大屠杀的全部真相终于被揭露出来。 1933 年至 45 年间，大约有 12,000,000 人被杀。


Along the way they encountered the depths of Nazi horrors when they discovered concentration camps. American soldiers saw humans that looked more like skeletons, gas chambers, crematoriums, and countless victims. Although American government officials were aware of atrocities against Jews, the sheer horror of the Holocaust of 12 million Jews, homosexuals, and anyone else Hitler had deemed deviant was unknown to its fullest extent.
一路上，当他们发现集中营时，他们遭遇了纳粹恐怖的深渊。美国士兵看到的是更像骷髅的人类、毒气室、火化炉以及无数的受害者。尽管美国政府官员知晓对犹太人的暴行，但对1200万犹太人、同性恋者, 以及希特勒视为异常者的大屠杀的真实恐怖程度, 仍然事先不为人知。

When the Allies entered Berlin, they discovered that the mastermind of all the destruction — Adolf Hitler — had already died by his own hand. With little left to sustain any sort of resistance, the Germans surrendered on May 8, 1945, hereafter known as V-E (VICTORY IN EUROPE) DAY.
当盟军进入柏林时，他们发现这一切破坏的主谋——阿道夫·希特勒——已经死在自己的手上了。由于无力维持任何形式的抵抗，德国人于 1945 年 5 月 8 日投降，这一天被称为 V-E（欧洲胜利日）。

'''

==== 51d. War in the Pacific 太平洋战争


Defeating Germany was only part of America's mission.
击败德国只是美国使命的一部分。

Pearl Harbor was only the beginning of Japanese assaults on American holdings in the Pacific. Two days after attacking Pearl Harbor, they seized Guam, and two weeks after that they captured WAKE ISLAND. Before 1941 came to a close, the Philippines came under attack.
珍珠港事件, 只是日本袭击美国太平洋领土的开始。袭击珍珠港两天后，他们占领了关岛，两周后又占领了威克岛。 1941 年结束之前，菲律宾遭受攻击。

Led by GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR, the Americans were confident they could hold the islands. A fierce Japanese strike proved otherwise. After retreating to strongholds at BATAAN AND CORREGIDOR, the United States had no choice but to surrender the Philippines. Before being summoned away by President Roosevelt, General MacArthur promised: "I SHALL RETURN."
在道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军的领导下，美国人有信心能够守住这些岛屿。日军的猛烈打击证明了事实并非如此。在撤退到巴丹岛和科雷吉多岛的据点后，美国别无选择，只能放弃菲律宾。在被罗斯福总统召回之前，麦克阿瑟将军许诺：“我将会回来。”

Before he returned however, the Japanese inflicted the BATAAN DEATH MARCH, a brutal 85-mile forced on American and Filipino POWs. 16,000 souls perished along the way.
然而，在他返回之前，日本人对美国和菲律宾战俘进行了"巴丹死亡行军"，这是一次残酷的 85 英里路程。途中有 16,000 人丧生。

.Bataan Death March 巴丹死亡行军

是第二次世界大战太平洋战争期间, 日军对巴丹半岛投降的76,000至78,000名美国与菲律宾战俘, 实施强迫行军、虐待、屠杀的暴行，后被判为"战争罪行"。
====

In June 1942, Japan hoped to capture Midway Island, an American held base about 1000 miles from Hawaii. Midway could have been used as a staging point for future attacks on Pearl Harbor. The United States was still benefiting from being able to decipher Japanese radio messages. American naval commanders led by CHESTER NIMITZ therefore knew the assault was coming.
1942 年 6 月，日本希望夺取距离夏威夷约 1000 英里的美国基地"中途岛"。中途岛可能被用作未来袭击"珍珠港"的中转站。美国仍然受益于能够破译日本无线电信息。因此，切斯特·尼米兹领导的美国海军指挥官, 知道袭击即将到来。

Airplane combat decided the BATTLE AT MIDWAY. After the smoke had cleared, four Japanese aircraft carriers had been destroyed. The plot to capture Midway collapsed, and Japan lost much of its offensive capability in the process. After the Battle of Midway, the Japanese were forced to fall back and defend their holdings.
飞机战斗决定了"中途岛战役"。硝烟散去后，四艘日本航空母舰被摧毁。夺取"中途岛"的阴谋失败了，日本在此过程中失去了大部分进攻能力。中途岛海战后，日军被迫撤退并保卫自己的据点。


In 1941, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was forced to surrender the Philippines, but made his famous promise of "I shall return." Three years later, he made good on his promise to liberate the islands.
1941年，道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军被迫投降菲律宾，但他做出了著名的“我会回来”的承诺。三年后，他兑现了解放岛屿的诺言。

Island hopping was the strategy used by the United States command. Rather than taking every Japanese fortification, the United States selectively chose a path that would move U.S. naval forces closer and closer to the Japanese mainland. In October 1944, MacArthur returned to the Philippines accompanied by a hundred ships and soon the islands were liberated. The capture of IWO JIMA and OKINAWA cleared the way for an all-out assault on Japan. Despite heavy losses, the Japanese refused to surrender. They intensified the attacks on American ships with suicide mission KAMIKAZE flights.
*"跳岛"是美国指挥部使用的策略。美国没有占领日本的所有防御工事，而是有选择地选择了一条让美国海军越来越接近日本本土的道路。* 1944年10月，麦克阿瑟率领一百艘舰艇返回菲律宾，很快菲律宾群岛就被解放了。占领"硫磺岛"和"冲绳"为全面进攻日本扫清了道路。尽管损失惨重，日军仍拒绝投降。他们利用神风特攻队的自杀式飞机，加强了对美国船只的攻击。

==== Japanese-American Internment 日裔美国人拘留

Publicly posted instructions for Japanese-Americans to turn themselves in
Many Americans worried that citizens of Japanese ancestry would act as spies or saboteurs for the Japanese government. Fear — not evidence — drove the U.S. to place over 127,000 Japanese-Americans in concentration camps for the duration of WWII.
许多美国人担心日裔公民会成为日本政府的间谍或破坏者。第二次世界大战期间，恐惧（而非证据）驱使美国将超过 127,000 名日裔美国人关进集中营。

Over 127,000 United States citizens were imprisoned during World War II. Their crime? Being of Japanese ancestry.
第二次世界大战期间，超过 127,000 名美国公民被监禁。他们的罪行？拥有日本血统。

Despite the lack of any concrete evidence, Japanese Americans were suspected of remaining loyal to their ancestral land. ANTI-JAPANESE PARANOIA increased because of a large Japanese presence on the West Coast. In the event of a Japanese invasion of the American mainland, Japanese Americans were feared as a security risk.
尽管缺乏任何具体证据，日裔美国人仍被怀疑仍然忠于他们祖先的土地。由于日本在西海岸的大量存在，反日偏执情绪有所增加。*一旦日本入侵美国本土，日裔美国人就会被视为安全风险。*

Succumbing to bad advice and popular opinion, President Roosevelt signed an executive order in February 1942 ordering the RELOCATION of all Americans of Japanese ancestry to CONCENTRATION CAMPS in the interior of the United States.
罗斯福总统屈从于不良建议和大众舆论，*于 1942 年 2 月签署了一项行政命令，命令将所有日裔美国人迁移到美国内陆的集中营。*

Evacuation orders were posted in JAPANESE-AMERICAN communities giving instructions on how to comply with the executive order. Many families sold their homes, their stores, and most of their assets. They could not be certain their homes and livelihoods would still be there upon their return. Because of the mad rush to sell, properties and inventories were often sold at a fraction of their true value.
**日裔美国人社区, 张贴了疏散令，**指示如何遵守行政命令。*许多家庭卖掉了他们的房屋、商店和大部分资产。他们无法确定返回后他们的家园和生计是否仍在那里。由于疯狂的抛售，房产和库存的售价, 往往只是其真实价值的一小部分。*


After being forced from their communities, Japanese families made these military style barracks their homes.
在被迫离开自己的社区后，日本家庭将这些军事风格的营房, 作为自己的家。


image:/img/090.jpg[,30%]

Until the camps were completed, many of the evacuees were held in temporary centers, such as stables at local racetracks. Almost two-thirds of the interns were NISEI, or Japanese Americans born in the United States. It made no difference that many had never even been to Japan. Even Japanese-American veterans of World War I were forced to leave their homes.
在营地建成之前，许多撤离者被关押在临时中心，例如当地赛马场的马厩。几乎三分之二的扣留, 是 NISEI，即出生在美国的日裔美国人。尽管许多人甚至从未去过日本，但这并没有什么区别。*即使是第一次世界大战的日裔美国退伍军人, 也被迫离开家园。*

Ten camps were finally completed in remote areas of seven western states. Housing was spartan, consisting mainly of tarpaper barracks. Families dined together at communal mess halls, and children were expected to attend school. Adults had the option of working for a salary of $5 per day. The United States government hoped that the interns could make the camps self-sufficient by farming to produce food. But cultivation on arid soil was quite a challenge.
最终在西部七个州的偏远地区, 建成了十个营地。房屋简朴，主要由防水纸搭建的营房组成。家人在公共食堂一起用餐，孩子们应该去上学。成年人可以选择以每天 5 美元的工资工作。美国政府希望"被扣押者"能够通过务农生产粮食，使难民营实现自给自足。但在干旱的土壤上种植, 是一个很大的挑战。



Most of the ten relocation camps were built in arid and semi-arid areas where life would have been harsh under even ideal conditions.
十个安置营, 大部分建在干旱和半干旱地区，即使在理想的条件下，这些地区的生活也很艰苦。

image:/img/091.jpg[,30%]



Evacuees elected representatives to meet with government officials to air grievances, often to little avail. Recreational activities were organized to pass the time. Some of the interns actually volunteered to fight in one of two all-Nisei army regiments and went on to distinguish themselves in battle.
*撤离者选出代表, 与政府官员会面表达不满，但往往收效甚微*。组织了娱乐活动来打发时间。一些实习生实际上自愿参加了两个全日清陆军团之一的战斗，并在战斗中表现出色。

Nisei is a Japanese term for a person born in America whose parents emigrated from Japan. They were American citizens, often spoke two languages, and only knew life in America. +
Nisei 是一个日语术语，指的是出生在美国、父母从日本移民的人。他们是美国公民，经常说两种语言，只了解美国的生活。

On the whole, however, life in the relocation centers was not easy. The camps were often too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer. The food was mass produced army-style grub. And the interns knew that if they tried to flee, armed sentries who stood watch around the clock, would shoot them.
但总体而言，安置点的生活并不轻松。营地往往冬天太冷，夏天太热。食物是批量生产的军用食物。被扣押者们知道，*如果他们试图逃跑，全天候站岗的武装哨兵就会开枪射杀他们。*

FRED KOREMATSU decided to test the government relocation action in the courts. He found little sympathy there. In KOREMATSU VS. THE UNITED STATES, the Supreme Court justified the executive order as a wartime necessity. When the order was repealed, many found they could not return to their hometowns. Hostility against Japanese Americans remained high across the West Coast into the postwar years as many villages displayed signs demanding that the evacuees never return. As a result, the interns scattered across the country.
FRED KOREMATSU 决定在法庭上测试政府的搬迁行动。他在那里很少得到同情。在是松诉美国案(KOREMATSU VS. UNITED STATES)中，最高法院证明了这一行政命令是战时必需的。*当禁令被废除后，许多人发现他们无法回到家乡。在整个西海岸，对日裔美国人的敌意一直居高不下，直到战后的几年，许多村庄都张贴了标语，要求撤离者永远不要回来。结果，被扣押者们分散到了全国各地。*

In 1988, Congress attempted to apologize for the action by awarding each surviving intern $20,000. While the American concentration camps never reached the levels of Nazi death camps as far as atrocities are concerned, they remain a dark mark on the nation's record of respecting civil liberties and cultural differences.
1988 年，国会试图为这一行为道歉，向每位幸存的被扣押者颁发 20,000 美元。尽管就暴行而言，美国集中营从未达到纳粹死亡营的水平，但它们仍然是该国尊重公民自由和文化差异的记录上的一个污点。

.Internment of Japanese Americans  对日裔美国人的囚禁

1941年珍珠港事件发生以后，美国政府于隔年战争白热化阶段，针对居住在美国太平洋沿岸的约12万日裔美国人的扣留，转移和囚禁。1942年2月19日，富兰克林·D·罗斯福总统下达了9066号行政命令，授权美国陆军部把美国国内某些地区设置为“战区”, 并对生活在战区的人, 加以任何必要的限制，甚至可以把他们驱逐出战区。这份命令声明，美国西海岸各州（加利福尼亚州、俄勒冈州、华盛顿州和亚利桑那州）的所有日裔美国人, 都有可能被强迫转移。

在所有被囚禁的日裔美国人中，62％是美国公民。直到二战结束, 美国才陆续解散了这些集中营。

**为了避免日裔美国人擅自离开禁区，美国政府禁止他们自银行账户中提款。日裔美国人被给予48小时离开集中营收拾简单的行李。**他们只被允许带一个包, 且不能携带收音机或相机。

**这些拘留营位于各州最贫瘠、荒芜的土地上，四周围着铁丝网和瞭望塔，**从外观上看，与德国纳粹的集中营并无二致，罗斯福总统都不止一次地把它们称为“集中营”。在拘留营内，**分配给一个6口或7口之家的住房只有30平方米，房间里没有独立的煤气炉和自来水，数个家庭共用一个洗衣间、一个餐厅和一个厕所。露天的淋浴间也是数个家庭共用的，瞭望塔上的哨兵可以清楚地看到在淋浴间里洗澡的人。**

联邦政府规定，拘留营内，每人每天的伙食费为50美分，糟糕的食物更是难以下咽。此外，不少被认为“可疑”的日裔居民，还遭到了“隔离审查”。

集中营被铁丝网所围绕，营内亦有持枪的士兵于看守塔驻守。有些人被射杀.

==== The Manhattan Project 曼哈顿计划



Early in 1939, the world's scientific community discovered that German physicists had learned the secrets of splitting a uranium atom. Fears soon spread over the possibility of Nazi scientists utilizing that energy to produce a bomb capable of unspeakable destruction.
1939年初，世界科学界发现德国物理学家已经掌握了分裂铀原子的秘密。人们很快就开始担心纳粹科学家可能会利用这种能量制造出具有难以形容的破坏力的炸弹。

Scientists ALBERT EINSTEIN, who fled Nazi persecution, and ENRICO FERMI, who escaped Fascist Italy, were now living in the United States. They agreed that the President must be informed of the dangers of atomic technology in the hands of the Axis powers. Fermi traveled to Washington in March to express his concerns to government officials. But few shared his uneasiness.

Einstein penned a letter to President Roosevelt urging the development of an atomic research program later that year. Roosevelt saw neither the necessity nor the utility for such a project, but agreed to proceed slowly. In late 1941, the American effort to design and build an ATOMIC BOMB received its code name — the MANHATTAN PROJECT.
同年晚些时候，爱因斯坦给罗斯福总统写了一封信，敦促发展原子研究计划。罗斯福既没有看到这个项目的必要性，也没有实用性，但同意缓慢推进。 1941 年底，美国设计和建造原子弹的计划获得了代号——曼哈顿计划。

At first the research was based at only a few universities — Columbia University, the University of Chicago and the University of California at Berkeley. A breakthrough occurred in December 1942 when Fermi led a group of physicists to produce the first controlled NUCLEAR CHAIN REACTION under the grandstands of STAGG FIELD at the University of Chicago.
最初，这项研究仅在几所大学进行——哥伦比亚大学、芝加哥大学和加州大学伯克利分校。 1942 年 12 月，费米带领一群物理学家, 在芝加哥大学 STAGG 场的看台上, 首次实现了受控核链式反应，取得了突破。


After this milestone, funds were allocated more freely, and the project advanced at breakneck speed. Nuclear facilities were built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Hanford, Washington. The main assembly plant was built at LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER was put in charge of putting the pieces together at Los Alamos. After the final bill was tallied, nearly $2 billion had been spent on research and development of the atomic bomb. The Manhattan Project employed over 120,000 Americans.
在这个里程碑之后，资金分配更加自由，项目以惊人的速度推进。核设施建于田纳西州橡树岭, 和华盛顿州汉福德。主装配厂建在新墨西哥州洛斯阿拉莫斯。罗伯特·奥本海默受命, 负责在洛斯阿拉莫斯将各个部分整合起来。最终帐目统计后，原子弹的研发已经花费了近20亿美元。曼哈顿计划雇用了超过 120,000 名美国人。

Secrecy was paramount. Neither the Germans nor the Japanese could learn of the project. Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed that Stalin would be kept in the dark. Consequently, there was no public awareness or debate. Keeping 120,000 people quiet would be impossible; therefore only a small privileged cadre of inner scientists and officials knew about the atomic bomb's development. In fact, Vice-President Truman had never heard of the Manhattan Project until he became President Truman.
**保密是最重要的。**德国人和日本人都无法得知该项目。罗斯福和丘吉尔也同意将斯大林蒙在鼓里。因此，没有公众意识或辩论。让 12 万人保持安静是不可能的；因此，只有一小部分享有特权的内部科学家和官员, 知道原子弹的研制情况。*事实上，副总统杜鲁门在成为杜鲁门总统之前, 从未听说过"曼哈顿计划"。*

Although the Axis powers remained unaware of the efforts at Los Alamos, American leaders later learned that a Soviet spy named KLAUS FUCHS had penetrated the inner circle of scientists.
尽管轴心国仍然不知道洛斯阿拉莫斯的努力，但美国领导人后来得知，*一位名叫克劳斯·福斯的苏联间谍, 已经渗透到科学家的核心圈子。*



By the summer of 1945, Oppenheimer was ready to test the first bomb. On July 16, 1945, at TRINITY SITE near ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO, scientists of the Manhattan Project readied themselves to watch the detonation of the world's first atomic bomb.
1945 年夏天，奥本海默准备测试第一颗炸弹。 1945 年 7 月 16 日，在新墨西哥州阿拉莫戈多附近的 TRINITY SITE，曼哈顿计划的科学家们准备观看世界上第一颗原子弹的爆炸。

The world had entered the nuclear age.
世界已进入核时代。

==== The Decision to Drop the Bomb


America had the bomb. Now what?
美国拥有原子弹。现在该怎么做？

When Harry Truman learned of the success of the Manhattan Project, he knew he was faced with a decision of unprecedented gravity. The capacity to end the war with Japan was in his hands, but it would involve unleashing the most terrible weapon ever known.
当哈里·杜鲁门得知"曼哈顿计划"取得成功时，他知道自己面临着一个前所未有的重大决定。结束与日本的战争的能力掌握在他手中，但这将涉及使用有史以来最可怕的武器。

American soldiers and civilians were weary from four years of war, yet the Japanese military was refusing to give up their fight. American forces occupied Okinawa and Iwo Jima and were intensely fire bombing Japanese cities. But Japan had an army of 2 million strong stationed in the home islands guarding against invasion.
美国士兵和平民, 因四年的战争而疲惫不堪，但日本军队拒绝放弃战斗。美军占领了冲绳岛和硫磺岛，并对日本城市进行猛烈的轰炸。但日本却有200万大军驻扎在本土岛屿上, 以防备入侵。



For Truman, the choice whether or not to use the atomic bomb was the most difficult decision of his life.
对于杜鲁门来说，是否使用原子弹的选择, 是他一生中最困难的决定。

First, an Allied demand for an immediate unconditional surrender was made to the leadership in Japan. Although the demand stated that refusal would result in total destruction, no mention of any new weapons of mass destruction was made. The Japanese military command rejected the request for unconditional surrender, but there were indications that a conditional surrender was possible.
首先，盟军向日本领导人提出立即"无条件投降"的要求。尽管要求指出拒绝将导致彻底毁灭，但没有提及任何新的大规模杀伤性武器。日本军司令部拒绝了无条件投降的要求，但有迹象表明"有条件投降"是可能的。

Regardless, on August 6, 1945, a plane called the ENOLA GAY dropped an atomic bomb on the city of HIROSHIMA. Instantly, 70,000 Japanese citizens were vaporized. In the months and years that followed, an additional 100,000 perished from burns and radiation sickness.
不管怎样，1945 年 8 月 6 日，一架名为 ENOLA GAY 的飞机向广岛市投下了一颗原子弹。瞬间，七万名日本公民化为灰烬。在随后的岁月里，又有 10 万人死于烧伤和放射病。


Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. On August 9, a second atomic bomb was dropped on NAGASAKI, where 80,000 Japanese people perished.
两天后，苏联对日宣战。 8月9日，第二颗原子弹落在长崎，造成8万日本人丧生。

On August 14, 1945, the Japanese surrendered.
1945年8月14日，日本投降。


Other critics argued that American diplomats had ulterior motives. The Soviet Union had entered the war against Japan, and the atomic bomb could be read as a strong message for the Soviets to tread lightly. In this respect, Hiroshima and Nagasaki may have been the first shots of the Cold War as well as the final shots of World War II.
其他批评者认为美国外交官别有用心。苏联已加入对日战争，原子弹可以被解读为苏联人要小心行事的强烈信息。从这个角度来看，广岛和长崎可能是冷战的第一枪，也是二战的最后一枪。

Truman stated that his decision to drop the bomb was purely military. A Normandy-type amphibious landing would have cost an estimated million casualties. Truman believed that the bombs saved Japanese lives as well. Prolonging the war was not an option for the President. Over 3,500 Japanese kamikaze raids had already wrought great destruction and loss of American lives.
杜鲁门表示，他投下炸弹的决定纯粹是出于军事目的。诺曼底式的两栖登陆预计将造成数百万人伤亡。杜鲁门相信这些炸弹也拯救了日本人的生命。延长战争不是总统的选择。日本神风特攻队的 3,500 多次袭击已经给美国人造成了巨大的破坏和人员伤亡。

The President rejected a demonstration of the atomic bomb to the Japanese leadership. He knew there was no guarantee the Japanese would surrender if the test succeeded, and he felt that a failed demonstration would be worse than none at all. Even the scientific community failed to foresee the awful effects of RADIATION SICKNESS. Truman saw little difference between atomic bombing Hiroshima and FIRE BOMBING Dresden or Tokyo.
总统拒绝向日本领导人事先展示原子弹。他知道，如果试验成功，日本人不一定会投降，而且他认为，示威失败比没有示威更糟糕。甚至科学界也未能预见到"辐射病"的可怕影响。杜鲁门认为"广岛原子弹爆炸"与"德累斯顿或东京火灾轰炸"之间没有什么区别。

Pandora's box was now open. The question that came flying out was, "How will the world use its nuclear capability?" It is a question still being addressed on a daily basis.
潘多拉的盒子现在打开了。随之而来的问题是：“世界将如何利用其核能力？”这是一个每天仍在讨论的问题。

=== America in the Second World War

For the second time in the 20th century, the United States became involved in a devastating world conflict.

The mobilization effort of the government in WORLD WAR II eclipsed even that of World War I. With major operations in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, American industries literally fueled two wars simultaneously. The social and economic consequences were profound. The GREAT MIGRATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS from the rural South to the industrial North was accelerated. New opportunities opened for women. Americans finally enjoyed a standard of living higher than the pre-Depression years.

But the war effort also had a darker side. Civil liberties were compromised, particularly for the 110,000 Japanese Americans who were forcibly uprooted from their West Coast homes to be sent to remote relocation camps.



In both Europe and Asia, the Axis powers had established a firm foothold prior to American entry into the conflict. Slowly, but surely the Allies closed the ring on Nazi Germany after turning points at El Alamein and STALINGRAD. Once Italy quit the Axis and the Allies landed successfully at NORMANDY, it was only a matter of time before the Nazi machine was smashed. Similar failures marked the early war in the Pacific, as the Japanese captured the Philippines. But once Japanese offensive capabilities were damaged at Midway, the United States "ISLAND HOPPED" its way to the Japanese mainland.



New technologies emerged during the war as well. RADAR helped the British locate incoming German planes, and SONAR made SUBMARINE detection much more feasible. GERMAN V-1 AND V-2 ROCKETS ushered in a new age of long-range warfare. But no weapon compared in destructive capacity to the atomic bomb, developed after a massive, secret research project spearheaded by the United States government.

World War II was fought over differences left unresolved after World War I. Over 400,000 Americans perished in the four years of involvement, an American death rate second only to the Civil War. Twelve million victims perished from Nazi atrocities in the HOLOCAUST. The deaths of twenty million Russians created a defensive Soviet mindset that spilled into the postwar era. After all the blood and sacrifice, the Axis powers were defeated, but the GRAND ALLIANCE that emerged victorious did not last long. Soon the world was involved in a 45-year struggle that claimed millions of additional lives — the Cold War.


'''


====  Wartime Strategy


Three days after Congress declared war on Japan, Germany responded by declaring war on the United States.

Japan had an advance pledge of support from Hitler in the event of war with the United States. Now President Roosevelt faced a two-ocean war — a true world war. Despite widespread cries for revenge against Japan, the first major decision made by the President was to concentrate on Germany first. The American Pacific Fleet would do its best to contain Japanese expansion, while emphasis was placed on confronting Hitler's troops.



Roosevelt believed that a Nazi-dominated Europe would be far more impregnable that any defenses Japan could build in the Pacific. American scientists worried that, with enough time, German scientists might develop weapons of mass destruction. Once Hitler was defeated, the combined Allied forces would concentrate on smashing Japanese ambitions.

American military leaders favored a far more aggressive approach to attacking Germany than their British counterparts. A cross-channel invasion of France from Britain would strike at the heart of Nazi strength, but the British command was dubious. Winston Churchill feared that should such an operation fail, the loss of human life, military resources, and British morale could be fatal.

Instead, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to implement an immediate blockade of supplies to Germany and to begin bombing German cities and munitions centers. The army would attack Hitler's troops at their weakest points first and slowly advance toward German soil. The plan was known as "CLOSING THE RING." In December 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to attack German holdings in North Africa first.

That maneuver was finally executed in October 1942. Nazi troops were occupying much of the African Mediterranean coast, which had been controlled by France prior to the war. Led by BRITISH GENERAL BERNARD MONTGOMERY, British forces struck at German and Italian troops commanded by the "DESERT FOX," German FIELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL, at EL ALAMEIN in Egypt. As the British forced a German retreat, Anglo-American forces landed on the west coast of Africa on November 8 to stage a simultaneous assault. Rommel fought gamely, but numbers and positioning soon forced a German surrender. The Allies had achieved their first important joint victory.


Simultaneously, the Soviets turned the tide against Nazi advances into the Soviet Union by defeating the German forces at Stalingrad. When springtime came in 1943, the Allies had indeed begun to close the ring.



Once Northern Africa was secured, the Allies took the next step toward Germany by launching invasions of Sicily and Italy. American and British leaders believed that when the Italian people faced occupation of their homeland, they would rise up and overthrow Mussolini. Fearing that the Allies would have a free road up to the border of Austria, German forces began to entrench themselves in Italy.

Despite German presence in Italy, Mussolini was arrested and the Italians surrendered to the Allies on September 3. There was no free road to Austria, however. German forces defended the peninsula ferociously, and even when the European war ended in May 1945, the Allies had failed to capture much of Italy.

'''


==== The American Homefront

America was the largest military power in the world — in theory.

The large population, generous natural resources, advanced infrastructure, and solid capital base were all just potential. Centralization and mobilization were necessary to jump-start this unwieldy machine. Within a week of Pearl Harbor, Congress passed the WAR POWERS ACT, granting wide authority to the President to conduct the war effort. Throughout the war hundreds more alphabet agencies were created to manage the American homefront.

First the United States needed to enlarge its armed forces. Because of the peacetime draft, the UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES boasted over 1.5 million members. By the end of the war, that number rose to 12 million. A more expansive draft and a vigorous recruitment campaign produced these results. Prodded by ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, FDR created women's auxiliary forces for the army (WACS), navy (WAVES), air force (WASPS), and Coast Guard (SPARS). The colossal ranks of the armed services created a huge labor shortage.

Toward this end a "WORK OR FIGHT" propaganda campaign was waged. "ROSIE THE RIVETER" posters beckoned housewives to leave the home and enter the nation's factories. About 6.5 million females entered the workforce during the war years, many for the first time. African Americans continued the Great Migration northward, filling vacated factory jobs. Mexican Americans were courted to cross the border to assist with the harvest season in the BRACERO GUEST-WORKER PROGRAM. Thousands of retirees went back on the job, and more and more teenagers pitched in to fill the demand for new labor.


The United States government spent over twice as much money fighting World War II as it had spent on all previous programs since its creation. Tax rates were raised to generate revenue and control inflation. Some people paid 90% of what they earned toward taxes!

Still, more money was needed so the government again launched Liberty and VICTORY LOAN DRIVES like those that helped finance the First World War. In addition, the size of the federal government more than tripled from about a million workers in 1940 to almost 3.5 million in 1945.

The United States managed to raise enough food and raw materials in the First World War through voluntary measures. This time, federal officials agreed that only through RATIONING could the demands be met. Americans were issued books of stamps for key items such as gasoline, sugar, meat, butter, canned foods, fuel oil, shoes, and rubber. No purchase of these commodities was legal without a stamp. VICTORY SPEED LIMITS attempted to conserve fuel by requiring Americans to drive more slowly. Rotating blackouts conserved fuel to be shipped overseas. Groups such as the Boy Scouts led scrap metal drives. Consumer goods like automobiles and refrigerators simply were not produced. Women drew lines down the backs of their legs to simulate nylon stockings when there were such shortages. Backyard gardens produced about 8 million tons of food.

At tremendous cost to the American taxpayer, the American people vanquished two evils: the AXIS POWERS and the Great Depression.



'''

==== D-Day and the German Surrender



The time had finally come. British and American troops had liberated North Africa and pressed on into Italy. Soviet troops had turned the tide at Stalingrad and were slowly reclaiming their territory. The ENGLISH CHANNEL was virtually free of Nazi submarines, and American and British planes were bombing German industrial centers around the clock.

Still, Hitler refused to surrender and hid behind his ATLANTIC WALL. Since the outbreak of war, Stalin was demanding an all-out effort to liberate France from German occupation. An invasion force greater than any in the history of the world was slowly amassing in southern Britain toward that end.



A great game of espionage soon unfolded. If the Germans could discover when and where the attack would occur, they could simply concentrate all their efforts in one area, and the operation would be doomed to failure. The Allies staged phony exercises meant to confuse German intelligence. Two-dimensional dummy tanks were arranged to distract air surveillance. There was considerable reason to believe the attack would come at CALAIS, where the English Channel is narrowest. In actuality, OPERATION OVERLORD was aiming for the NORMANDY PENINSULA on the morning of June 4, 1944.



After D-DAY, the days of the German resistance were numbered. Paris was liberated in August 1944 as the Allies pushed slowly eastward. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was moving into German territory as well. Hitler, at the BATTLE OF THE BULGE, launched a final unsuccessful counteroffensive in December 1944. Soon the Americans, British, and Free French found themselves racing the Soviets to Berlin.


Following the defeat of the Nazi regime, the full extent of the Holocaust was at last revealed.  Approximately 12,000,000 people were killed between 1933-45.


Along the way they encountered the depths of Nazi horrors when they discovered concentration camps. American soldiers saw humans that looked more like skeletons, gas chambers, crematoriums, and countless victims. Although American government officials were aware of atrocities against Jews, the sheer horror of the Holocaust of 12 million Jews, homosexuals, and anyone else Hitler had deemed deviant was unknown to its fullest extent.

When the Allies entered Berlin, they discovered that the mastermind of all the destruction — Adolf Hitler — had already died by his own hand. With little left to sustain any sort of resistance, the Germans surrendered on May 8, 1945, hereafter known as V-E (VICTORY IN EUROPE) DAY.

'''

==== 51d. War in the Pacific


Defeating Germany was only part of America's mission.

Pearl Harbor was only the beginning of Japanese assaults on American holdings in the Pacific. Two days after attacking Pearl Harbor, they seized Guam, and two weeks after that they captured WAKE ISLAND. Before 1941 came to a close, the Philippines came under attack.

Led by GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR, the Americans were confident they could hold the islands. A fierce Japanese strike proved otherwise. After retreating to strongholds at BATAAN AND CORREGIDOR, the United States had no choice but to surrender the Philippines. Before being summoned away by President Roosevelt, General MacArthur promised: "I SHALL RETURN."

Before he returned however, the Japanese inflicted the BATAAN DEATH MARCH, a brutal 85-mile forced on American and Filipino POWs. 16,000 souls perished along the way.


In June 1942, Japan hoped to capture Midway Island, an American held base about 1000 miles from Hawaii. Midway could have been used as a staging point for future attacks on Pearl Harbor. The United States was still benefiting from being able to decipher Japanese radio messages. American naval commanders led by CHESTER NIMITZ therefore knew the assault was coming.

Airplane combat decided the BATTLE AT MIDWAY. After the smoke had cleared, four Japanese aircraft carriers had been destroyed. The plot to capture Midway collapsed, and Japan lost much of its offensive capability in the process. After the Battle of Midway, the Japanese were forced to fall back and defend their holdings.


In 1941, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was forced to surrender the Philippines, but made his famous promise of "I shall return." Three years later, he made good on his promise to liberate the islands.

Island hopping was the strategy used by the United States command. Rather than taking every Japanese fortification, the United States selectively chose a path that would move U.S. naval forces closer and closer to the Japanese mainland. In October 1944, MacArthur returned to the Philippines accompanied by a hundred ships and soon the islands were liberated. The capture of IWO JIMA and OKINAWA cleared the way for an all-out assault on Japan. Despite heavy losses, the Japanese refused to surrender. They intensified the attacks on American ships with suicide mission KAMIKAZE flights.


In April 1945, President Roosevelt died of a brain hemorrhage, and HARRY TRUMAN was unexpectedly left to decide the outcome of the war in the Pacific.

'''


==== Japanese-American Internment

Publicly posted instructions for Japanese-Americans to turn themselves in
Many Americans worried that citizens of Japanese ancestry would act as spies or saboteurs for the Japanese government. Fear — not evidence — drove the U.S. to place over 127,000 Japanese-Americans in concentration camps for the duration of WWII.

Over 127,000 United States citizens were imprisoned during World War II. Their crime? Being of Japanese ancestry.

Despite the lack of any concrete evidence, Japanese Americans were suspected of remaining loyal to their ancestral land. ANTI-JAPANESE PARANOIA increased because of a large Japanese presence on the West Coast. In the event of a Japanese invasion of the American mainland, Japanese Americans were feared as a security risk.

Succumbing to bad advice and popular opinion, President Roosevelt signed an executive order in February 1942 ordering the RELOCATION of all Americans of Japanese ancestry to CONCENTRATION CAMPS in the interior of the United States.

Evacuation orders were posted in JAPANESE-AMERICAN communities giving instructions on how to comply with the executive order. Many families sold their homes, their stores, and most of their assets. They could not be certain their homes and livelihoods would still be there upon their return. Because of the mad rush to sell, properties and inventories were often sold at a fraction of their true value.


After being forced from their communities, Japanese families made these military style barracks their homes.



Until the camps were completed, many of the evacuees were held in temporary centers, such as stables at local racetracks. Almost two-thirds of the interns were NISEI, or Japanese Americans born in the United States. It made no difference that many had never even been to Japan. Even Japanese-American veterans of World War I were forced to leave their homes.

Ten camps were finally completed in remote areas of seven western states. Housing was spartan, consisting mainly of tarpaper barracks. Families dined together at communal mess halls, and children were expected to attend school. Adults had the option of working for a salary of $5 per day. The United States government hoped that the interns could make the camps self-sufficient by farming to produce food. But cultivation on arid soil was quite a challenge.



Most of the ten relocation camps were built in arid and semi-arid areas where life would have been harsh under even ideal conditions.




Evacuees elected representatives to meet with government officials to air grievances, often to little avail. Recreational activities were organized to pass the time. Some of the interns actually volunteered to fight in one of two all-Nisei army regiments and went on to distinguish themselves in battle.




On the whole, however, life in the relocation centers was not easy. The camps were often too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer. The food was mass produced army-style grub. And the interns knew that if they tried to flee, armed sentries who stood watch around the clock, would shoot them.

FRED KOREMATSU decided to test the government relocation action in the courts. He found little sympathy there. In KOREMATSU VS. THE UNITED STATES, the Supreme Court justified the executive order as a wartime necessity. When the order was repealed, many found they could not return to their hometowns. Hostility against Japanese Americans remained high across the West Coast into the postwar years as many villages displayed signs demanding that the evacuees never return. As a result, the interns scattered across the country.

In 1988, Congress attempted to apologize for the action by awarding each surviving intern $20,000. While the American concentration camps never reached the levels of Nazi death camps as far as atrocities are concerned, they remain a dark mark on the nation's record of respecting civil liberties and cultural differences.

For Truman, the choice whether or not to use the atomic bomb was the most difficult decision of his life.

Although the demand stated that refusal would result in total destruction, no mention of any new weapons of mass destruction was made. The Japanese military command rejected the request for unconditional surrender, but there were indications that a conditional surrender was possible.

Regardless, on August 6, 1945, a plane called the ENOLA GAY dropped an atomic bomb on the city of HIROSHIMA. Instantly, 70,000 Japanese citizens were vaporized. In the months and years that followed, an additional 100,000 perished from burns and radiation sickness.


Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. On August 9, a second atomic bomb was dropped on NAGASAKI, where 80,000 Japanese people perished.

On August 14, 1945, the Japanese surrendered.


Other critics argued that American diplomats had ulterior motives. The Soviet Union had entered the war against Japan, and the atomic bomb could be read as a strong message for the Soviets to tread lightly. In this respect, Hiroshima and Nagasaki may have been the first shots of the Cold War as well as the final shots of World War II.

Truman stated that his decision to drop the bomb was purely military. A Normandy-type amphibious landing would have cost an estimated million casualties. Truman believed that the bombs saved Japanese lives as well. Prolonging the war was not an option for the President. Over 3,500 Japanese kamikaze raids had already wrought great destruction and loss of American lives.

The President rejected a demonstration of the atomic bomb to the Japanese leadership. He knew there was no guarantee the Japanese would surrender if the test succeeded, and he felt that a failed demonstration would be worse than none at all. Even the scientific community failed to foresee the awful effects of RADIATION SICKNESS. Truman saw little difference between atomic bombing Hiroshima and FIRE BOMBING Dresden or Tokyo.

Pandora's box was now open. The question that came flying out was, "How will the world use its nuclear capability?" It is a question still being addressed on a daily basis.
