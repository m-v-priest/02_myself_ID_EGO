=== The Road to Pearl Harbor 通往珍珠港之路



Storm clouds were darkening around the world. While Americans struggled to make ends meet during the Great Depression, fascism swept Italy and Germany. Remembering the scars caused by WORLD WAR I, Americans hoped against hope to remain aloof from the increasingly dangerous world.
世界各地的暴风云, 正在变暗。当美国人在大萧条期间努力维持生计时，法西斯主义席卷了意大利和德国。美国人铭记第一次世界大战造成的伤痕，希望能够远离这个日益危险的世界。


Americans clung to their time-tested philosophy of isolationism. A series of Neutrality Acts sought to avoid the entrapments that plunged the nation into World War I. Poll after poll showed an unwillingness to become diplomatically involved in international disputes. Isolationist clubs spread across the land.
美国人坚持他们经过时间考验的"孤立主义"哲学。一系列中立法案, 试图避免让国家陷入第一次世界大战的困境。一次又一次的民意调查显示，他们不愿意在外交上卷入国际争端。孤立主义俱乐部遍布全国。

Yet when Great Britain became the last bastion of freedom standing against a Nazi-controlled Europe, Americans reluctantly began to act. Led by President Roosevelt, the United States used its industrial might to become the arsenal of democracy for the Allied war effort.
然而，当英国成为对抗纳粹控制的欧洲的最后自由堡垒时，美国人不情愿地开始采取行动。在罗斯福总统的领导下，美国利用其工业实力, 成为盟军战争努力的民主武器库。

In the end, it was Japan who provoked the United States into war. The United States was the only nation standing against Japanese domination of the entire PACIFIC RIM. When economic sanctions against Japan produced a diplomatic stalemate, Japan launched a ruthless surprise attack against American naval bases at Pearl Harbor. Faced with an assault on its own forces, the United States finally entered the Second World War.
最终，是日本挑起了美国的战争。美国是唯一反对日本统治整个环太平洋地区的国家。当对日本的经济制裁造成外交僵局时，日本对美国珍珠港海军基地发动了无情的突然袭击。面对本国军队的攻击，美国最终加入了第二次世界大战。

==== 1930s Isolationism 20世纪30年代孤立主义


"Leave me alone," seemed to be America's attitude toward the rest of the world in the 1930s.
“别管我”, 似乎是 20 世纪 30 年代美国对世界其他国家的态度。

At the dawn of the '30s, foreign policy was not a burning issue for the average American. The stock market had just crashed and each passing month brought greater and greater hardships. American involvement with Europe had brought war in 1917 and unpaid debt throughout the 1920s. Having grown weary with the course of world events, citizens were convinced the most important issues to be tackled were domestic. Foreign policy leaders of the 1930s once again led the country down its well-traveled path of isolationism.
三十年代初期，对于普通美国人来说, "外交政策"并不是一个紧迫的问题。股市刚刚崩盘，每个月都带来越来越大的困难。美国对欧洲的介入, 导致了 1917 年的战争, 和整个 20 年代的未偿债务。由于对世界事件的进程感到厌倦，公民们相信要解决的最重要的问题是"国内问题"。 20世纪30年代的外交政策领导人, 再次带领该国走上了"孤立主义"的老路。

The Hoover Administration set the tone for an isolationist foreign policy with the Hawley-Smoot Tariff. Trade often dominated international relations and the protective wall of the tariff left little to discuss. The Far East became an area of concern when the Japanese government ordered an attack on CHINESE MANCHURIA. This invasion was a clear violation of the NINE POWER TREATY, which prohibited nations from carving a special sphere of influence in China.
胡佛政府通过霍利-斯穆特关税, 为孤立主义外交政策, 定下了基调。贸易往往主导国际关系，关税保护墙几乎没有什么可讨论的。当日本政府下令进攻中国满洲时，远东成为一个令人担忧的地区。这次入侵明显违反了《九国公约》，该条约禁止各国在中国划定特殊势力范围。


[.my1]

.Nine-Power Treaty 九国公约
《九国条约》缺乏任何执行规章，当日本违反公约在在1931年入侵满洲和建立满洲国期间，美国除了表示抗议和施加经济制裁外无能为力。 1937年11月， 第二次中日战争爆发后，《九国条约》的签署国在布鲁塞尔召集了九国公约大会 ，不过无济于事。 但不管如何，该条约最终还是对"淞沪会战"的发生起到了一定的影响，使日军不敢大规模进攻。


."门户开放"政策
美国国务卿约翰·海伊于1899年9月至11月发出了有关门户开放政策的“公开信”，请求: +
- 所有在中国拥有特权的国家, 正式宣布将保持"门户开放"， +
- 在他们在中国的势力范围内的通商口岸，所有的国家都拥有平等的进出权利。 +
- 由于担心欧洲列强和日本正准备将中国瓜分为殖民地，海伊还增加了一些条款，*要求维护中国的领土和主权完整。*

1900年以后订立的条约, 都参考了门户开放政策 。

在日俄战争 （1904-1905）和二十一条（1915）之后，美国尤其对"日本对中国的意图"持怀疑态度，并多次与日本政府签署协议，要求日本承诺维持"满洲"和"中国其余地区"平等的政策 。 但这些协议随着1917年《 蓝辛—石井协议》的缔结，就被证明完全无效。

.Lansing–Ishii Agreement 蓝辛-石井协定
是在1917年11月2日签订，双方重申在中国尊重“门户开放”、“机会均等”及维持中国政权及领土完整等多项原则。*但同时，美国却又承认日本由于“地理上的接近”，在中国享有“特殊利益”。美国政府这一举动与其提倡之"门户开放"政策自相矛盾。*

美国总统哈定在1922年3月8日, 对参议院的信件中指出：1917年11月2日签署的**所谓《兰辛-石井协定》并不是条约，而是**美国国务卿与日本特命全权大使石井子爵**之间的公开声明。** 从本质上讲，这种交换意见只不过是行政政策的宣言。 这样的声明或交换照会, 不会产生任何与现有或之后生效的条约义务不一致的效力。

该协定曾被认为是美-日关系中的里程碑，但**由于换文内容含糊，有可能出现不同的演绎方式，故此该协定实际上并未有发挥重大作用。最终，该协定于1922年被废除，为华盛顿会议中达成的"九国公约"所取代。**

The Hoover Administration knew that any harsh action against JAPAN would be unpopular in the midst of the Great Depression. The official American response was the STIMSON DOCTRINE, which refused to recognize any territory illegally occupied by Japan. As meek as this may sound, it went further toward condemning Japan than the government of Great Britain was willing to do.
胡佛政府知道，在大萧条时期，任何针对日本的严厉行动都不会受欢迎。美国的官方回应是"史汀生主义"，拒绝承认任何被日本非法占领的领土。尽管这听起来可能很温和，但它对日本的谴责, 却超出了英国政府的意愿。

One possibility for international economic cooperation failed at the LONDON CONFERENCE OF 1933. Leaders of European nations hoped to increase trade and stabilize international currencies. Roosevelt sent a "BOMBSHELL MESSAGE" to the conference refusing any attempt to tie the American dollar to a gold standard. The conference dissolved with European delegates miffed at the lack of cooperation by the United States.
国际经济合作的一种可能性, 在1933年的伦敦会议上失败了。欧洲国家领导人希望增加贸易, 并稳定国际货币。罗斯福向会议发出了“重磅炸弹消息”，拒绝任何将美元与金本位挂钩的尝试。会议解散，欧洲代表对美国缺乏合作感到愤怒。

Roosevelt did realize that the Hawley-Smoot Tariff was forestalling American economic recovery. Toward this end, Congress did act to make United States trade policy more flexible. Under the Reciprocal Trade Agreement of 1934, Congress authorized the President to negotiate tariff rates with individual nations. Should a nation agree to reduce its barriers to trade with the United States, the President could reciprocate without the consent of Congress. In addition, FDR broke a 16-year-old diplomatic freeze with the SOVIET UNION by extending formal recognition. Roosevelt hoped to settle some nettlesome outstanding issues with the Soviets, and at the same time stimulate bilateral trade.
**罗斯福确实意识到霍利-斯穆特关税, 正在阻碍美国经济复苏。为此，国会确实采取了使美国贸易政策更加灵活的行动。**根据 1934 年互惠贸易协定，**国会授权总统与个别国家, 谈判关税税率。如果一个国家同意减少与美国的贸易壁垒，总统可以在未经国会同意的情况下做出回报。**此外，罗斯福通过正式承认苏联，打破了与苏联长达 16 年的外交冻结。罗斯福希望与苏联解决一些棘手的悬而未决的问题，同时刺激双边贸易。


The Japanese attack on Chinese Manchuria was in direct violation of the Nine Powers Treaty, which had been passed to prevent nations from establishing a special sphere of influence in China.
*日本对中国满洲的进攻, 直接违反了旨在阻止各国在中国建立特殊势力范围的《九国条约》。*

Isolationists did not however designate the Western Hemisphere as a dangerous region. On the contrary, as tensions grew in Europe and Asia, a strong sense of PAN-AMERICANISM swept the diplomatic circles. In the face of overseas adversity, strong hemispheric solidarity was attractive. To foster better relations with the nations to the south, Roosevelt declared a bold new GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY. Marines stationed in Central America and the Caribbean were withdrawn. The (Theodore) ROOSEVELT COROLLARY, which proclaimed the right of the United States to intervene in Latin American affairs was renounced.
然而，孤立主义者并未将西半球指定为危险地区。相反，随着欧洲和亚洲紧张局势加剧，强烈的泛美主义情绪席卷了外交界。面对海外逆境，西半球的强大团结具有吸引力。为了与南方国家建立更好的关系，罗斯福宣布了一项大胆的新睦邻政策。驻扎在中美洲和加勒比地区的海军陆战队已撤出。宣布美国干预拉丁美洲事务的权利的（西奥多）罗斯福推论, 被放弃。

==== Reactions to a Troubled World 对动荡世界的反应


The day after Franklin Roosevelt took the oath of office the Nazi REICHSTAG gave ADOLF HITLER absolute control of Germany. Hitler had campaigned spewing ANTI-SEMITIC rhetoric and vowing to rebuild a strong Germany.
富兰克林·罗斯福宣誓就职的第二天，纳粹国会授予阿道夫·希特勒对德国的绝对控制权。希特勒在竞选中大肆宣扬"反犹太主义"言论，并发誓要重建一个强大的德国。

During the week prior to FDR's inauguration, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations for the condemnation of Japanese aggressions in China. FASCISM and MILITARISM were spreading across Europe and East Asia. Meanwhile Americans were not bracing themselves for the coming war; they were determined to avoid it at all costs.
在罗斯福就职前一周，日本因"谴责日本侵略中国"而退出国际联盟。"法西斯主义"和"军国主义"在欧洲和东亚蔓延。与此同时，美国人并没有为即将到来的战争做好准备。他们决心不惜一切代价避免这种情况。

The first act of European aggression was not committed by Nazi Germany. Fascist DICTATOR BENITO MUSSOLINI ordered the Italian army to invade ETHIOPIA in 1935. The League of Nations refused to act, despite the desperate pleas from Ethiopia's leader HAILE SELASSIE.
欧洲的第一次侵略行为, 并不是纳粹德国所为。 1935 年，法西斯独裁者贝尼托·墨索里尼, 命令意大利军队入侵埃塞俄比亚。尽管埃塞俄比亚领导人海尔·塞拉西极力恳求，国际联盟仍拒绝采取行动。

The following year Hitler and Mussolini formed the ROME-BERLIN AXIS, an alliance so named because its leaders believed that the line that connected the two capitals would be the axis around which the entire world would revolve. Later in 1936, Hitler marched troops into the Rhineland of Germany, directly breaching the TREATY OF VERSAILLES, which was signed after World War I. A few months later, Fascist GENERAL FRANCISCO FRANCO launched an attempt to overthrow the established LOYALIST government of SPAIN. Franco received generous support from Hitler and Mussolini.
次年，希特勒和墨索里尼组成了"罗马-柏林轴心联盟"，之所以如此命名，是因为其领导人相信连接两个首都的线将成为整个世界围绕的轴心。 1936年晚些时候，**希特勒出兵进入德国"莱茵兰"，直接违反了第一次世界大战后签署的《凡尔赛条约》。**几个月后，法西斯将军弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥, 发起了推翻西班牙"保皇派政府"的企图。佛朗哥得到了希特勒和墨索里尼的慷慨支持。



While Fascist aggressors were chalking up victories across Europe, America, Britain, and France sat on the sidelines. The desire to avoid repeating the mistakes of World War I was so strong, no government was willing to confront the dictators. Economic sanctions were unpopular during the height of the Great Depression. The Loyalists in Spain were already receiving aid from the Soviet Union; therefore, public opinion was against assisting Moscow in its "private" war against fascism. As the specter of dictatorship spread across Europe, the West feebly objected with light rebukes and economic penalties with no teeth.
**当法西斯侵略者在欧洲取得胜利时，美国、英国和法国却袖手旁观。避免重蹈第一次世界大战覆辙的愿望是如此强烈，**以至于没有政府愿意与独裁者对抗。在大萧条最严重的时期，经济制裁并不受欢迎。西班牙的效忠派已经接受了苏联的援助；因此，公众舆论反对协助莫斯科进行反法西斯的“私人”战争。*当独裁的幽灵在欧洲蔓延时，西方以轻微的谴责, 和不加牙齿的经济惩罚, 来软弱地进行反对。*

The United States Congress and President Roosevelt passed three important laws — all called NEUTRALITY ACTS — directly aimed at reversing the mistakes made that led to the American entry into the First World War.
*美国国会和罗斯福总统, 通过了三项重要法律——全部称为《中立法案》——直接旨在扭转"导致美国加入第一次世界大战的错误"。*

The NEUTRALITY ACT OF 1935 prohibited the shipping of arms to nations at war, including the victims of aggressions. This would reduce the possibility of maritime attacks on American vessels. A Senate Committee led by Gerald Nye had conducted extensive research on US activities prior to World War I concluded that trade and international finance had been the leading cause of American entry.
**1935 年的《中立法案》, 禁止向交战国家（包括侵略受害者）运送武器。这将减少美国船只遭受海上袭击的可能性。**由杰拉尔德·奈领导的**参议院委员会, 对第一次世界大战前美国的活动, 进行了广泛的研究，得出的结论是，贸易和国际金融, 是美国进入的主要原因。**

Sinking of the Lusitania
The Neutrality Act of 1936 was designed to keep American citizens out of peril by forbidding them to travel on the ships of warring nations. More than 100 Americans were killed when a German submarine torpedoed the Lusitania in 1915.
1936 年的《中立法案》, 旨在禁止美国公民乘坐交战国家的船只，从而使他们免受危险。 1915 年，一艘德国潜艇用鱼雷击沉了卢西塔尼亚号，造成 100 多名美国人死亡。

The NEUTRALITY ACT OF 1936 renewed the law of the previous year with the additional restrictions — no loans could be made to belligerent nations. Nor were any Americans permitted to travel on the ships of nations at war. There would be no more LUSITANIA incidents.
**1936 年的中立法案, 更新了前一年的法律，但增加了额外的限制——不得向交战国提供贷款。任何美国人也不被允许乘坐交战国家的船只。**不会再有卢西塔尼亚事件了。

A NEUTRALITY ACT OF 1937 limited the trade of even non-munitions to belligerent nations to a "CASH AND CARRY BASIS." This meant that the nation in question would have to use its ships to transport goods to avoid American entanglements on the high seas. Isolationists in Congress felt reasonably confident that these measures would keep the United States out of another war.
1937 年的中立法案, 甚至将与交战国的非军火贸易, 限制为“现购自运”。这意味着该国将不得不使用其船只来运输货物，以避免美国在公海上的纠缠。国会中的孤立主义者有理由相信，这些措施将使美国远离另一场战争。

[.my1]

.Cash and carry
Cash and Carry was a policy by US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced at a joint session of the United States Congress on September 21, 1939, subsequent to the outbreak of war in Europe. It replaced the Neutrality Act of 1937, by which belligerents could purchase only nonmilitary goods from the United States as long as the recipients paid immediately in cash and assumed all risk in transportation using their own ships. A later revision, the Neutrality Act of 1939, allowed the sale of military arms to belligerents on the same cash-and-carry basis.
"现购自运"是 1939 年 9 月 21 日欧洲战争爆发后，美国总统富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福, 在美国国会联席会议上宣布的一项政策。它取代了 1937 年的《中立法案》，**根据该法案，交战方只能从美国购买非军事物资，只要接收者立即以现金支付，并承担"使用自己的船只来运输"的所有风险。**后来的修订，即 1939 年《中立法案》，允许在同样的"现购自运"基础上, 向交战方出售军事武器。

The first Neutrality Act was passed in August 1935. It was renewed in 1936 and later extended to May 1937. The Act forbade selling implements of war or lending money to belligerent countries under any terms. US passengers traveling on foreign ships were advised that they did so at their own risk.
第一个中立法案于 1935 年 8 月通过，并于 1936 年更新，后来延长至 1937 年 5 月。该法案禁止以任何条件, 向交战国出售战争工具或贷款。乘坐外国船只的美国乘客被告知，他们需要自行承担风险。

However, after Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the position of many in Congress changed.
然而，1939 年 9 月德国入侵波兰后，国会中许多人的立场发生了变化。

1939 年 9 月，德国军队入侵波兰后在华沙举行阅兵式。英国和法国对德国宣战作为回应。第二次世界大战正式打响。



Reports of the "RAPE OF NANKING," the sacking of the Chinese capital reached the American mainland in the summer of 1937. The brutalities prompted President Roosevelt to abandon cooperation with Congressional isolationists to pursue a more forceful approach against the Japanese.
1937 年夏天，有关“南京大屠杀”（即洗劫中国首都）的报道传到了美国本土。这些暴行促使罗斯福总统放弃与国会孤立主义者的合作，转而对日本采取更有力的手段。

The Munich Pact of 1938 recognized Germany's claim to the Sudetenland and Italy's claim to Ethiopia in exchange for the promise of no further aggressions.

欧洲大部分地区都在庆祝《慕尼黑协定》，因为他们认为这是防止欧洲大陆发生重大战争的一种方式。阿道夫·希特勒宣布这是他在北欧的最后一次领土主张。*如今，《慕尼黑协定》被广泛认为是一种失败的绥靖行为，这个词已经成为: 绥靖'扩张主义极权主义国家'却徒劳 的代名词*

In October 1937, he delivered his famous QUARANTINE SPEECH in Chicago. For the first time, Roosevelt advocated collective action to stop the epidemic aggression. But his hopes of igniting American sensibilities failed.
1937 年 10 月，他在芝加哥发表了著名的隔离演讲。罗斯福首次主张采取集体行动，制止法西斯侵略的蔓延。但他激发美国人情感的希望落空了。

Emboldened by western inaction, Hitler's troops marched into Austria in 1938 and annexed the country. Then Hitler set his eyes upon the SUDETENLAND, a region in western Czechoslovakia inhabited by 3.5 million Germans. In September the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy met in Munich attempting to diffuse a precarious situation.
受到西方无所作为的鼓舞，希特勒军队于 1938 年进军奥地利并吞并了该国。随后，希特勒将目光投向了苏台德地区，这是捷克斯洛伐克西部的一个地区，居住着 350 万德国人。 9月，英国、法国、德国和意大利领导人在慕尼黑举行会议，试图化解不稳定的局势。

Britain and France recognized Hitler's claim to the Sudetenland and Mussolini's conquest of Ethiopia in exchange for the promise of no future aggressions. PRIME MINISTER NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN returned to Great Britain triumphantly proclaiming that he had achieved "peace in our time." It would be one of the most mocked statements of the 20th century.
英国和法国承认希特勒对苏台德地区的主权要求, 和墨索里尼对埃塞俄比亚的征服，以换取未来不再侵略的承诺。首相内维尔·张伯伦回到英国，胜利地宣称他已经实现了“我们时代的和平”。这将是 20 世纪最受嘲笑的言论之一。



European appeasement failed six months later, as Hitler mockingly marched his troops into the rest of Czechoslovakia.
六个月后，欧洲的绥靖政策失败了，希特勒嘲讽地将军队开进了捷克斯洛伐克的其他地区。

In May 1939, Roosevelt urged Congressional leaders to repeal the arms embargo of the earlier Neutrality Acts. Senators from both parties refused the request. Another bombshell crossed the Atlantic on August 24. Adolf Hitler and JOSEF STALIN agreed to put their mutual hatred aside. Germany and the Soviet Union signed a ten-year NONAGGRESSION PACT. Hitler was now free to seize the territory Germany had lost to Poland as a result of the Treaty of Versailles. On September 1, 1939, Nazi troops crossed into Poland from the west.
1939 年 5 月，罗斯福敦促国会领导人废除早期"中立法案"中的武器禁运。两党参议员都拒绝了这一请求。 8 月 24 日，另一枚重磅炸弹横渡大西洋。阿道夫·希特勒和约瑟夫·斯大林同意放下彼此的仇恨。德国和苏联签署了十年互不侵犯条约。希特勒现在可以自由地夺取德国因《凡尔赛条约》而失去的领土。 1939年9月1日，纳粹军队从西部进入波兰。

Finally, on September 3, France and Great Britain declared war on Germany. World War II had begun.
最终，9月3日，法国和英国对德国宣战。第二次世界大战开始了。

==== The Arsenal of Democracy 民主的兵工厂


War had finally come.
战争终于来临了。

Two days after Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany, President Roosevelt issued a proclamation of neutrality and ordered the suspension of munitions sales to all belligerents. But Roosevelt stopped short of asking that Americans remain emotionally neutral in the European conflict. FDR knew that the only chance Britain and France would have to defeat the German Reich was to have ample supplies of weaponry. He immediately began to press Congress to repeal the ARMS EMBARGO.
英国和法国向纳粹德国宣战两天后，罗斯福总统发布中立公告，并下令暂停"向所有交战方出售军火"。但罗斯福没有要求美国人在欧洲冲突中, 保持情感中立。*罗斯福知道，英国和法国击败德意志帝国的唯一机会, 就是拥有充足的武器供应。他立即开始向国会施压，要求废除"武器禁运"。*

The request was simple. Allow trade of MUNITIONS with belligerent nations on a "cash and carry" basis. There would be no danger to American shipping if the Allies had to carry the supplies on their own ships. Isolationists were concerned, but support for the President's initiative was strong enough. The NEUTRALITY ACT OF 1939 ended the arms embargo and permitted the sales of munitions on a "cash and carry" basis.
要求很简单。允许在“现购自运”的基础上, 与交战国进行弹药贸易。**如果盟军必须用自己的船只运送物资，那么美国航运就不会有危险。**孤立主义者对此表示担忧，但对总统倡议的支持足够强烈。 *1939 年的《中立法案》结束了武器禁运，并允许以“现购自运”的方式销售弹药。*

Meanwhile, the European war seemed to be more talk than action. Throughout the fall and winter of 1939-40, Stalin moved Soviet troops into sovereign Eastern European states including eastern Poland, but Hitler's WEHRMACHT was silent. Europeans nervously joked of a "phony war" as the winter drew to a close.
**与此同时，欧洲战争似乎是"空谈"多于"行动"。 1939-40 年整个秋冬季，**斯大林将苏联军队调往包括波兰东部在内的东欧主权国家，但希特勒的国防军却保持沉默。冬天即将结束时，*欧洲人紧张地开玩笑说这是一场“假战争”。*

Suddenly on April 9, 1940, the German BLITZKRIEG moved rapidly into Denmark and Norway. As the weeks passed, the German war machine steadily advanced through the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and into northern France. Hitler arrived in France to sign the terms of French surrender. The hapless French were forced to submit to the Germans in the very same railroad car the Germans surrendered twenty-two years previously at the end of World War I. Britain was the only democracy in Europe in open opposition to Germany.
1940 年 4 月 9 日，德国闪电战突然进入丹麦和挪威。几周过去了，德国的战争机器稳步推进，穿过荷兰、比利时、卢森堡，进入法国北部。希特勒抵达法国签署法国投降条款。倒霉的法国被迫在二十二年前第一次世界大战结束时德国投降的同一辆火车车厢里, 向德国屈服。*英国是欧洲唯一公开反对德国的民主国家。*

New PRIME MINISTER WINSTON CHURCHILL desperately pleaded with Roosevelt for assistance. In the summer of 1940, Hitler launched OPERATION SEA LION, an all-out assault on the British mainland. The ROYAL AIR FORCE of Britain battled the German Luftwaffe in the greatest air battle in history as Americans watched nervously.
新任首相温斯顿·丘吉尔, 迫切恳求罗斯福提供援助。 1940年夏，希特勒发动“海狮行动”，全面进攻英国本土。英国皇家空军与德国空军, 进行了历史上最伟大的空战，美国人紧张地观看着。

Slowly but surely American public opinion shifted toward helping the British. The COMMITTEE TO DEFEND AMERICA BY AIDING THE ALLIES launched a propaganda campaign to mobilize the American public. Groups like the AMERICA FIRST COMMITTEE, which contained prominent Americans such as CHARLES LINDBERGH, insisted a hemispheric defense was the wisest choice for the United States to follow. A great debate was on.
美国公众舆论缓慢但肯定地转向帮助英国。援助盟国保卫美国委员会, 发起了一场动员美国公众的宣传运动。美国第一委员会等团体, 坚持认为"西半球防御"是美国最明智的选择，该委员会, 由查尔斯·林德伯格等美国名人组成。一场激烈的辩论正在进行中。

Miraculously Britain held its own with Germany while America deliberated. In September 1940, the United States agreed to the transfer of 50 old destroyers to the British fleet in exchange for naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. By directly aiding the ALLIES, America could no longer hide behind the shield of neutrality. At Roosevelt's urging, Congress authorized the construction of new planes to defend America's coast. Congress also enacted the first peacetime draft in the nation's history in September 1940. The interventionist argument seemed to be prevailing, but debate continued into 1941.
*英国奇迹般地在德国面前坚持了下来，而美国则在深思熟虑。* 1940年9月，美国同意将50艘旧驱逐舰, 移交给英国舰队，以换取西半球的海军基地。通过直接援助盟国，美国不能再躲在中立的盾牌后面。在罗斯福的敦促下，国会授权建造新飞机, 来保卫美国海岸。国会还于 1940 年 9 月, 颁布了美国历史上第一个和平时期的草案。干预主义的论点似乎占了上风，但**争论一直持续到 1941 年。**

Senator Robert Taft
Congress eventually approved the Lend-Lease Act, but not without a great deal of debate. Senator Robert Taft argued that the Act allowed the U.S. "to carry on a kind of undeclared war."
国会最终批准了《租借法案》，但并非没有经过大量辩论。参议员罗伯特·塔夫脱认为，该法案允许美国“进行一种不宣而战的战争”。

The DESTROYER DEAL was helpful, but Britain simply did not have the financial reserves to pay for all the weapons they needed. Roosevelt feared another postwar debt crisis so he hatched a new plan called Lend-Lease. Roosevelt publicly mused that if a neighbor's house is on fire, nobody sells him a hose to put it out. Common sense dictated that the hose is lent to the neighbor and returned when the fire is extinguished. The United States could simply lend Great Britain the materials it would need to fight the war. When the war was over, they would be returned. The Congress hotly argued over the proposal. SENATOR ROBERT TAFT retorted: "Lending war equipment is a good deal like lending chewing gum. You don't want it back."
《驱逐舰协议》很有帮助，但英国根本没有财政储备来支付他们所需的所有武器。罗斯福担心战后会出现另一场债务危机，因此他制定了一项名为“租借法案”的新计划。罗斯福公开表示，如果邻居的房子着火了，没有人会卖给他一根水管来灭火。常识告诉我们，软管应该借给邻居，并在火被扑灭后归还。美国可以简单地借给英国战争所需的物资。战争结束后，他们就会回来。国会对该提案进行了激烈争论。参议员罗伯特·塔夫脱反驳道：“出借战争装备就像借出口香糖一样划算。你不会想要回来的。”

In March 1941 after a great deal of controversy, Congress approved the LEND-LEASE ACT, which eventually appropriated $50 billion of aid to the Allies. Meanwhile Roosevelt began an unprecedented third term.
**1941 年 3 月，经过大量争议后，国会批准了《租借法案》，最终向盟军拨款 500 亿美元。**与此同时，罗斯福开始了前所未有的第三任期。

是美国国会在第二次世界大战初期通过的一项法案，目的是在美国不卷入战争的同时，为同盟国提供战争物资，租借法案使得美国成为名副其实的“民主兵工厂”。

1939年9月纳粹德国入侵波兰，第二次世界大战欧洲战场正式爆发；欧洲各国重新整军经武，面临了军备青黄不接的艰困时期。**美国虽然有能力提供世界各国需要的武器，但是因美国"中立法"限制, 有很多严格的但书。一般所知的就有得"以现款或贵金属采购"，而"不得以贷款方式采购"（"现购自运"政策），且运输手段也有相当多的规范。**

美国总统罗斯福对于轴心国的侵略态度, 采取了一些游走在灰色地带的政策对应，如1940年"驱逐舰换基地协议"，开始用有价交换的方式, 及时供给大英帝国各领土极需护航用的"驱逐舰"；

而后来罗斯褔的立场也日趋明显，1940年12月29日的炉边谈话节目中, 已充分表露他将采取的手段；他强调美国应以生产更多的武器成为英国的后盾，并贩售给英国及加拿大，也就是民主兵工厂谈话。

虽然"孤立主义者"批评罗斯福总统的政策, 将会将美国带入战争，但民意风向确实因德国扩张而松动. 而后租借法案在于参众议院开始审理，在众议院投票通过，**在1941年3月11日生效，**为第1776号案，授权美国总统“售卖、转移、交换、租赁、借出、或交付任何防卫物资，予美国总统认为与"美国国防"有至关重要之国家政府”；法案最初授权总统借出不多于13亿美元的物资。罗斯福总统随即任命小爱德华·斯特蒂纽斯成立租借法案管理办公室。

*在3月法案生效时，可使用国家仅包括"英联邦"，4月"中华民国"开始纳入，10月接受"苏联"能运用此法案采购物资。*

.驱逐舰换基地协议
是美国和英国间的一项交易，发生于1940年9月2日。**在交易中，美国共计50艘老式驱逐舰, 被转交给英国海军，以换取8个"英属北美和西印度群岛殖民地"的"海军港口"和"军用机场"的99年使用权。**

Neutrality was no longer a façade behind which America could hide. Hitler saw Lend-Lease as tantamount to a war declaration and ordered attacks on American ships.
"中立"不再是美国可以躲藏的幌子。希特勒认为"租借法案"等同于宣战，并下令袭击美国船只。

Roosevelt urged Congress and Americans to take action. In his famous FOUR FREEDOM SPEECH he enumerates what the rights of any citizen of the world are and why it is important for America to lead the way:
罗斯福敦促国会和美国人采取行动。在他著名的四大自由演讲中，他列举了世界上任何公民的权利是什么，以及为什么美国带头很重要：

The first is freedom of speech and expression — everywhere in the world. The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way — everywhere in the world. The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants — everywhere in the world. The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor — anywhere in the world.
首先是世界各地的"言论和表达自由"。 +
第二个是世界各地的每个人都可以"自由地以自己的方式敬拜上帝"。 +
第三个**是"免于匮乏的自由"**，用世界术语来说，这意味着经济上的理解，这将确保世界各地每个国家的居民在和平时期过上健康的生活。 +
第四个是**"免于恐惧的自由"，**用世界术语来说，意味着在全世界范围内彻底削减军备，使任何国家都无法对任何邻国实施武力侵略。 -- 在世界上任何地方。


Congress still vacillated. Roosevelt met with Churchill in the summer of 1941 and agreed to the ATLANTIC CHARTER, a statement that outlined Anglo-American war aims. At this point, the United States was willing to commit almost everything to the Allied war machine — money, resources, and diplomacy.
国会仍然犹豫不决。 1941 年夏天，罗斯福会见了丘吉尔，并同意《大西洋宪章》，该声明概述了英美战争目标。此时，美国愿意向盟军战争机器, 奉献几乎一切——金钱、资源和外交。

.Atlantic Charter 大西洋宪章
由美国总统罗斯福, 和英国首相丘吉尔, 于1941年8月13日签署. 章宣布了民族自治、领土完整、经济国际主义、社会安全、缩减军备以及国际合作等八个原则，并决心以此作为重建战后世界和平和秩序的政策依据。虽不具约束力，但标志着英美两国在政治上结成了同盟.

该文件全文共8条，宣布两国不追求领土或其他方面的扩张，不承认法西斯通过侵略造成的领土变更，尊重各国人民选择其政府形式的权利，恢复被暴力剥夺的各国人民的主权，各国在贸易和原料方面享受平等待遇，促成一切国家在经济方面最全面的合作，摧毁纳粹暴政后重建和平，公海航行自由，各国必须放弃武力削减军备，解除侵略国家的武装。*"大西洋宪章"的精神, 后来写入了"联合国宪章"。*


大西洋宪章具体内容如下：

1. 两国不寻求任何领土的或其他方面的扩张；
1. 他们不希望看见任何与人民意志不符合的领土变更；
1. 他们尊重所有民族选择他们愿意生活于其下的政府形式之权利；他们希望看到曾经被武力剥夺其主权及自治权的民族，重新获得主权与自治；
1. 他们要在尊重他们现有的义务下，努力促使所有国家，不分大小，战胜者或战败者，都有机会在同等条件下，为了实现它们经济的繁荣，参加世界贸易和获得世界的原料；
1. 他们希望促成所有国家在经济领域内最充分的合作，以促进所有国家的劳动水平、经济进步和社会保障；
1. **在纳粹暴政被最后消灭之后，**他们希望建立和平，使所有国家能够在它们境内安然自存，并**保障所有地方的所有人在"免于恐惧"和"不虞匮乏"的自由中，**安度他们的一生；
1. 这样的和平, 将使所有人能够在公海上, 不受阻碍地自由地航行；
1. 他们相信为了现实的和精神上的理由，世界上所有国家必须放弃使用武力。如果那些在国境外从事或可能以侵略相威胁的国家, 继续使用陆海空武器装备，则无法维持未来的和平；所以他们相信，**在一个更普遍和更持久的全面安全体系建立之前，必须解除这些国家的武装。**同样，他们会协助和鼓励一切其他可行的措施，来减轻爱好和平的人民在军备上的沉重负担。

==== 50e. Pearl Harbor 珍珠港



While the international picture in Europe was growing increasingly dimmer for the United States, relations with Japan were souring as well. Japan's aggression was literally being fueled by the United States. The Japanese military machine relied heavily on imports of American steel and oil to prosecute its assault on China and French Indochina.
尽管对美国来说, 欧洲的国际形势日益黯淡，但它与日本的关系也在恶化。*日本的侵略实际上是由美国助长的。日本的军事机器, 严重依赖进口美国的钢铁和石油, 来攻击中国和法属印度支那。*

Placing a strict embargo on Japan would have seemed obvious, but Roosevelt feared that Japan would strike at the resource-laden Dutch East Indies to make up the difference. Beginning in late-1940, the United States grew less patient with Japanese atrocities and began to restrict trade with the Empire.
对日本实行严格禁运, 似乎是理所当然的事，但罗斯福担心, 日本会袭击资源丰富的荷属东印度群岛, 来弥补能源短缺的差距。*从 1940 年底开始，美国对日本的暴行失去了耐心，并开始限制与日本的贸易。*

Just prior to Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, Japan signed a nonaggression pact with Stalin. This removed the threat of a Russian attack on Japan's new holdings. With Europe busy fighting Hitler, the United States remained the only obstacle to the establishment of a huge Japanese empire spanning East Asia.
就在希特勒入侵苏联之前，日本与斯大林签署了互不侵犯条约。这消除了俄罗斯攻击日本新资产的威胁。*当欧洲忙于与希特勒作战时，美国仍然是建立横跨东亚的庞大日本帝国的唯一障碍。*

By the end of 1940, the United States had ended shipments of scrap metal, steel, and iron ore to Japan. Simultaneously, the United States began to send military hardware to CHIANG KAI-SHEK, the nominal leader of the Chinese forces resisting Japanese takeover.
1940 年底，美国停止向日本运送废金属、钢铁和铁矿石。与此同时，美国开始向中国抗日军队的名义领导人蒋介石, 提供军事装备。



Negotiations between Japan and the U.S. began in early 1941, but there was little movement. By midsummer, FDR made the fateful step of freezing all Japanese assets in the United States and ending shipments of oil to the island nation. Negotiations went nowhere. The United States was as unwilling to accept Japanese expansion and Japan was unwilling to end its conquests.
**日本和美国之间的谈判, 于 1941 年初开始，但进展甚微。仲夏时节，罗斯福迈出了决定性的一步，冻结了日本在美国的所有资产，并停止向这个岛国运送石油。**谈判毫无结果。美国不愿意接受日本的扩张，日本也不愿意结束其征服。

American diplomats did, however, have a hidden advantage. With the help of "MAGIC," a decoding device, the United States was able to decipher Japan's radio transmissions. Leaders in Washington knew that the deadline for diplomacy set by Japan's high command was November 25. When that date came and passed, American officials were poised for a strike. The prevailing view was that the attack would focus on British Malaya or the Dutch East Indies to replenish dwindling fuel supplies.
然而，美国外交官确实有一个隐藏的优势。在解码设备“MAGIC”的帮助下，**美国能够破译日本的无线电传输。华盛顿领导人知道，日本最高指挥部设定的外交最后期限是 11 月 25 日。当这个日期到来并过去时，美国官员已做好了发动打击的准备。**普遍的观点是，袭击将集中在英属马来亚或荷属东印度群岛，以补充日益减少的燃料供应。

Unbeknown to the United States, a Japanese fleet of aircraft carriers stealthily steamed toward Hawaii.
美国不知道的是，日本的一支航空母舰舰队正悄悄驶向夏威夷。

The goals for the Japanese attack were simple. Japan did not hope to conquer the United States or even to force the abandonment of Hawaii with the attack on Pearl Harbor. The United States was too much of a threat to their newly acquired territories. With holdings in the Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, and other small islands, Japan was vulnerable to an American naval attack. A swift first strike against the bulk of the UNITED STATES PACIFIC FLEET would seriously cripple the American ability to respond. The hopes were that Japan could capture the PHILIPPINES and American island holdings before the American navy could recuperate and retaliate. An impenetrable fortress would then stretch across the entire Pacific Rim. The United States, distracted by European events, would be forced to recognize the new order in East Asia.
**日本进攻的目标很简单。**日本并不希望征服美国，甚至不希望通过袭击珍珠港迫使其放弃夏威夷。美国对他们新获得的领土构成了太大的威胁。日本拥有菲律宾、关岛、美属萨摩亚和其他小岛屿，因此很容易受到美国海军的攻击。对美国太平洋舰队主力的快速首次打击, 将严重削弱美国的反应能力。日本人希望日本能够在美国海军恢复元气, 并进行报复之前, 占领菲律宾和美国的岛屿。一座坚不可摧的堡垒将横跨整个环太平洋地区。*被欧洲事件分散注意力的美国, 将被迫承认东亚的新秩序。*



All these assumptions were wrong. As the bombs rained on PEARL HARBOR on the infamous morning of Sunday, December 7, 1941, almost 3,000 Americans were killed. Six battleships were destroyed or rendered unseaworthy, and most of the ground planes were ravaged as well. Americans reacted with surprise and anger.
所有这些假设都是错误的。 1941 年 12 月 7 日那个臭名昭著的早晨，炸弹如雨点般袭击珍珠港，导致近 3,000 名美国人丧生。六艘战列舰被摧毁或无法航行，大部分地面飞机也被毁坏。美国人的反应是惊讶和愤怒。

Most American newspaper headlines had been focusing on European events, so the Japanese attack was a true blindside. When President Roosevelt addressed the Congress the next day and asked for a declaration of war, there was only one dissenting vote in either house of Congress. Despite two decades of regret over World War I and ostrichlike isolationism, the American people plunged headfirst into a destructive conflict.
大多数美国报纸的头条都集中在欧洲的事件上，所以日本的进攻是一个真正的意外。第二天，当罗斯福总统向国会发表讲话，要求宣战时，国会参众两院只有一人投了反对票。尽管对第一次世界大战和鸵鸟式的孤立主义悔恨了20年，美国人民还是一头栽进了一场破坏性的冲突。

=== America in the Second World War 第二次世界大战中的美国

For the second time in the 20th century, the United States became involved in a devastating world conflict.
美国在20世纪, 第二次卷入毁灭性的世界冲突。

The mobilization effort of the government in WORLD WAR II eclipsed even that of World War I. With major operations in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, American industries literally fueled two wars simultaneously. The social and economic consequences were profound. The GREAT MIGRATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS from the rural South to the industrial North was accelerated. New opportunities opened for women. Americans finally enjoyed a standard of living higher than the pre-Depression years.
**政府在第二次世界大战中的动员力度, 甚至超过了第一次世界大战。**美国工业在大西洋和太平洋战区, 都有重要行动，实际上同时助长了两场战争。**社会和经济后果是深远的。**非裔美国人从南方农村向北方工业大迁徙的速度加快。*为女性带来了新的机遇。美国人终于享受到了比大萧条前更高的生活水平。*

But the war effort also had a darker side. Civil liberties were compromised, particularly for the 110,000 Japanese Americans who were forcibly uprooted from their West Coast homes to be sent to remote relocation camps.
**但战争努力, 也有阴暗的一面。公民自由受到损害，**尤其是 110,000 名日裔美国人，他们被强行从西海岸的家园连根拔起，送往偏远的安置营。



In both Europe and Asia, the Axis powers had established a firm foothold prior to American entry into the conflict. Slowly, but surely the Allies closed the ring on Nazi Germany after turning points at El Alamein and STALINGRAD. Once Italy quit the Axis and the Allies landed successfully at NORMANDY, it was only a matter of time before the Nazi machine was smashed. Similar failures marked the early war in the Pacific, as the Japanese captured the Philippines. But once Japanese offensive capabilities were damaged at Midway, the United States "ISLAND HOPPED" its way to the Japanese mainland.
在欧洲和亚洲，轴心国在美国介入冲突之前, 就已经站稳了脚跟。在阿拉曼和斯大林格勒的转折点之后，盟军缓慢但坚定地关闭上了对纳粹德国的包围圈。一旦意大利退出轴心国、盟军成功登陆诺曼底，纳粹机器被粉碎只是时间问题。类似的失败标志着太平洋战争的早期，日本占领了菲律宾。但一旦日本的进攻能力在中途岛遭到破坏，美国就“跳岛”前往日本本土。

.阿拉曼战役
是第二次世界大战中"北非战场"的转折点。这次战役从1942年10月23日一直持续到11月3日。**盟军在阿拉曼的胜利, 致使意大利和德国欲占领埃及、控制苏伊士运河, 及中东油田的希望破灭。**这次战役结束了非洲装甲集团军的攻势，**此场战役后, 轴心国于北非战场转入战略撤退。**

*"阿拉曼战役"与同时期的"斯大林格勒战役"与"瓜达康纳尔战役", 成为同盟国进入"战略反攻阶段"的开始。*

全长约164公里. 这条运河连结了欧洲与亚洲之间的南北双向水运，船只不必绕过非洲南端的"好望角"，大大节省航程。

运河当前由埃及的苏伊士运河管理局拥有和管理。*由于位置极具战略价值，根据君士坦丁堡公约，“运河在战时也可像和平时期一样，任何商用及军用船只均可使用，而无需悬挂区别旗帜。”*

法兰西第二殖民帝国, 因为美洲的殖民地被英国所夺，所以重点向东方发展。打通"苏伊士运河"对法国意义更为重大。运河于1869年11月17日通航。

New technologies emerged during the war as well. RADAR helped the British locate incoming German planes, and SONAR made SUBMARINE detection much more feasible. GERMAN V-1 AND V-2 ROCKETS ushered in a new age of long-range warfare. But no weapon compared in destructive capacity to the atomic bomb, developed after a massive, secret research project spearheaded by the United States government.
战争期间也出现了新技术。"雷达"帮助英国定位来袭的德国飞机，"声纳"使潜艇探测变得更加可行。德国 V-1 和 V-2 火箭弹, 开创了远程战争的新时代。但没有任何一种武器的破坏力可以与原子弹相比，原子弹是在美国政府牵头的大规模秘密研究项目后开发出来的。

World War II was fought over differences left unresolved after World War I. Over 400,000 Americans perished in the four years of involvement, an American death rate second only to the Civil War. Twelve million victims perished from Nazi atrocities in the HOLOCAUST. The deaths of twenty million Russians created a defensive Soviet mindset that spilled into the postwar era. After all the blood and sacrifice, the Axis powers were defeated, but the GRAND ALLIANCE that emerged victorious did not last long. Soon the world was involved in a 45-year struggle that claimed millions of additional lives — the Cold War.
**第二次世界大战, 是因第一次世界大战后未解决的分歧而爆发的。四年来，超过 40 万美国人丧生，美国死亡率仅次于内战。**一千二百万受害者死于纳粹大屠杀的暴行。两千万俄罗斯人的死亡, 创造了苏联的防御心态，这种心态一直蔓延到战后时代。经过所有的鲜血和牺牲，轴心国被击败，但胜利的大联盟并没有持续多久。很快，世界就卷入了一场长达 45 年的斗争，夺走了数百万人的生命——冷战。

====  Wartime Strategy 51a.战时策略


Three days after Congress declared war on Japan, Germany responded by declaring war on the United States.
*国会对日本宣战三天后，德国也对美国宣战。*

Japan had an advance pledge of support from Hitler in the event of war with the United States. Now President Roosevelt faced a two-ocean war — a true world war. Despite widespread cries for revenge against Japan, the first major decision made by the President was to concentrate on Germany first. The American Pacific Fleet would do its best to contain Japanese expansion, while emphasis was placed on confronting Hitler's troops.
日本事先得到希特勒的保证，一旦日本与美国发生战争，德国将给予支持。现在罗斯福总统面临着一场两洋战争——一场真正的世界大战。尽管人们普遍呼吁报复日本，但**总统做出的第一个重大决定就是, 首先集中精力对付德国。美国"太平洋舰队"将尽力遏制日本的扩张，同时美国的重点放在对抗希特勒的军队。**



Roosevelt believed that a Nazi-dominated Europe would be far more impregnable that any defenses Japan could build in the Pacific. American scientists worried that, with enough time, German scientists might develop weapons of mass destruction. Once Hitler was defeated, the combined Allied forces would concentrate on smashing Japanese ambitions.
*罗斯福认为，纳粹统治的欧洲, 将比日本在太平洋建立的任何防御都要坚不可摧。美国科学家担心，如果有足够的时间，德国科学家可能会研制出大规模杀伤性武器。一旦击败希特勒，盟军将集中力量粉碎日本的野心。*

American military leaders favored a far more aggressive approach to attacking Germany than their British counterparts. A cross-channel invasion of France from Britain would strike at the heart of Nazi strength, but the British command was dubious. Winston Churchill feared that should such an operation fail, the loss of human life, military resources, and British morale could be fatal.
美国军事领导人, 倾向于采取比英国军事领导人更加激进的方式, 来攻击德国。英国对法国的跨海峡入侵, 将打击纳粹的核心力量，但英国的指挥权, 却令人怀疑。温斯顿·丘吉尔担心，如果这样的行动失败，人员伤亡、军事资源和英国士气的损失, 可能是致命的。

Instead, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to implement an immediate blockade of supplies to Germany and to begin bombing German cities and munitions centers. The army would attack Hitler's troops at their weakest points first and slowly advance toward German soil. The plan was known as "CLOSING THE RING." In December 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to attack German holdings in North Africa first.
*替代的，罗斯福和丘吉尔同意, 立即封锁对德国的物资供应，并开始轰炸德国的城市和弹药中心。军队将首先攻击希特勒的部队最薄弱的地方，然后慢慢向德国领土推进。这个计划被称为“缩紧包围圈”。1941年12月，罗斯福和丘吉尔同意首先攻击德国在北非的据点。*

That maneuver was finally executed in October 1942. Nazi troops were occupying much of the African Mediterranean coast, which had been controlled by France prior to the war. Led by BRITISH GENERAL BERNARD MONTGOMERY, British forces struck at German and Italian troops commanded by the "DESERT FOX," German FIELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL, at EL ALAMEIN in Egypt. As the British forced a German retreat, Anglo-American forces landed on the west coast of Africa on November 8 to stage a simultaneous assault. Rommel fought gamely, but numbers and positioning soon forced a German surrender. The Allies had achieved their first important joint victory.
这一行动最终于 1942 年 10 月实施。纳粹军队占领了战前由法国控制的非洲"地中海沿岸"大部分地区。在英国将军伯纳德·蒙哥马利的率领下，英国军队在埃及阿拉曼, 袭击了由“沙漠之狐”德国陆军元帅埃尔文·隆美尔指挥的德国和意大利军队。**当英国迫使德军撤退时，英美联军于 11 月 8 日在非洲西海岸登陆，**同时发起进攻。虽然隆美尔奋勇作战，但数量和布局, 很快迫使德军投降。盟军取得了他们的第一个重要的联合胜利。

Simultaneously, the Soviets turned the tide against Nazi advances into the Soviet Union by defeating the German forces at Stalingrad. When springtime came in 1943, the Allies had indeed begun to close the ring.
*与此同时，苏联在斯大林格勒击败了德国军队，扭转了纳粹向苏联进军的局面。 1943年春天到来时，盟军确实开始封闭包围圈。*



Once Northern Africa was secured, the Allies took the next step toward Germany by launching invasions of Sicily and Italy. American and British leaders believed that when the Italian people faced occupation of their homeland, they would rise up and overthrow Mussolini. Fearing that the Allies would have a free road up to the border of Austria, German forces began to entrench themselves in Italy.
**一旦北非获得安全，盟军就向德国迈出了下一步，入侵西西里岛和意大利。美国和英国领导人相信，当意大利人民面临祖国被占领时，他们会奋起推翻墨索里尼。**由于担心盟军有一条通往奥地利边境的自由道路，德国军队开始在意大利巩固自己的阵地。

Despite German presence in Italy, Mussolini was arrested and the Italians surrendered to the Allies on September 3. There was no free road to Austria, however. German forces defended the peninsula ferociously, and even when the European war ended in May 1945, the Allies had failed to capture much of Italy.
尽管德国在意大利存在，墨索里尼还是被捕了，意大利人于 9 月 3 日向盟军投降。然而，通往奥地利的道路并不畅通。德国军队顽强地保卫着半岛，*即使 1945 年 5 月欧洲战争结束，盟军也未能占领意大利的大部分地区。*

==== The American Homefront 美国国土安全部

America was the largest military power in the world — in theory.
理论上，美国是世界上最大的军事强国。

The large population, generous natural resources, advanced infrastructure, and solid capital base were all just potential. Centralization and mobilization were necessary to jump-start this unwieldy machine. Within a week of Pearl Harbor, Congress passed the WAR POWERS ACT, granting wide authority to the President to conduct the war effort. Throughout the war hundreds more alphabet agencies were created to manage the American homefront.
*庞大的人口、丰富的自然资源、先进的基础设施, 和雄厚的资本基础, 都只是潜力。要启动这台笨重的机器，必须进行集中化和动员。珍珠港事件发生一周内，国会通过了《战争权力法》，授予总统广泛的权力来开展战争工作。整个战争期间，又成立了数百个字母机构来管理美国后方。*

First the United States needed to enlarge its armed forces. Because of the peacetime draft, the UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES boasted over 1.5 million members. By the end of the war, that number rose to 12 million. A more expansive draft and a vigorous recruitment campaign produced these results. Prodded by ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, FDR created women's auxiliary forces for the army (WACS), navy (WAVES), air force (WASPS), and Coast Guard (SPARS). The colossal ranks of the armed services created a huge labor shortage.
首先，美国需要扩大其武装部队。由于**和平时期的征兵，美国武装部队拥有超过 150 万名成员。到战争结束时，这个数字上升到 1200 万。**更广泛的征兵和强有力的招募活动产生了这些结果。在埃莉诺·罗斯福的推动下，罗斯福为陆军（WACS）、海军（WAVES）、空军（WASPS）和海岸警卫队（SPARS）创建了女性辅助部队。*庞大的军队队伍, 造成了巨大的劳动力短缺。*

Toward this end a "WORK OR FIGHT" propaganda campaign was waged. "ROSIE THE RIVETER" posters beckoned housewives to leave the home and enter the nation's factories. About 6.5 million females entered the workforce during the war years, many for the first time. African Americans continued the Great Migration northward, filling vacated factory jobs. Mexican Americans were courted to cross the border to assist with the harvest season in the BRACERO GUEST-WORKER PROGRAM. Thousands of retirees went back on the job, and more and more teenagers pitched in to fill the demand for new labor.
为此，开展了“工作或战斗”的宣传运动。 “铆工罗西”海报吸引**家庭主妇离开家，进入国家的工厂。**大约 650 万女性在战争年代进入劳动力市场，其中许多是第一次。*非裔美国人继续向北大迁徙，填补工厂空缺的职位。* BRACERO 客工计划邀请墨西哥裔美国人跨越边境, 协助收获季节。*成千上万的退休人员, 重返工作岗位，越来越多的青少年加入进来，以满足对新劳动力的需求。*


The United States government spent over twice as much money fighting World War II as it had spent on all previous programs since its creation. Tax rates were raised to generate revenue and control inflation. Some people paid 90% of what they earned toward taxes!
美国政府在二战中花费的资金, 是其自创建以来, 在所有先前项目上花费的资金的两倍多。**提高税率是为了创造税收收入, 并控制通货膨胀。**有些人将收入的 90% 用来缴税！

Still, more money was needed so the government again launched Liberty and VICTORY LOAN DRIVES like those that helped finance the First World War. In addition, the size of the federal government more than tripled from about a million workers in 1940 to almost 3.5 million in 1945.
**尽管如此，仍然需要更多的资金，因此政府再次启动了"自由和胜利贷款"计划，**就像那些为第一次世界大战提供资金的计划一样。此外，**联邦政府的规模增加了两倍多，**从 1940 年的约 100 万工人增加到 1945 年的近 350 万。

The United States managed to raise enough food and raw materials in the First World War through voluntary measures. This time, federal officials agreed that only through RATIONING could the demands be met. Americans were issued books of stamps for key items such as gasoline, sugar, meat, butter, canned foods, fuel oil, shoes, and rubber. No purchase of these commodities was legal without a stamp. VICTORY SPEED LIMITS attempted to conserve fuel by requiring Americans to drive more slowly. Rotating blackouts conserved fuel to be shipped overseas. Groups such as the Boy Scouts led scrap metal drives. Consumer goods like automobiles and refrigerators simply were not produced. Women drew lines down the backs of their legs to simulate nylon stockings when there were such shortages. Backyard gardens produced about 8 million tons of food.
美国在第一次世界大战中, 通过自愿措施, 筹集了足够的粮食和原材料。这一次，联邦官员同意, 只有通过配给才能满足这些要求。美国人获得了汽油、糖、肉类、黄油、罐头食品、燃油、鞋子和橡胶等关键物品的邮票册。如果没有邮票，购买这些商品就是合法的。胜利限速, 试图通过要求美国人放慢车速, 来节省燃料。**轮流停电, 节省了运往海外的燃料。**童子军等团体领导了废金属运动。**汽车和冰箱等消费品, 根本就没有生产。**当尼龙袜短缺时，妇女们在腿后画线以模仿尼龙袜。后院花园生产了约 800 万吨粮食。

At tremendous cost to the American taxpayer, the American people vanquished two evils: the AXIS POWERS and the Great Depression.
美国人民付出了巨大的代价，美国纳税人战胜了两大罪恶：轴心国和大萧条。

==== D-Day and the German Surrender



The time had finally come. British and American troops had liberated North Africa and pressed on into Italy. Soviet troops had turned the tide at Stalingrad and were slowly reclaiming their territory. The ENGLISH CHANNEL was virtually free of Nazi submarines, and American and British planes were bombing German industrial centers around the clock.
*时机终于到了。英国和美国军队解放了北非, 并向意大利挺进。苏联军队在斯大林格勒扭转了局势，并正在慢慢收复领土。英吉利海峡几乎没有纳粹潜艇存在了，美国和英国的飞机昼夜不停地轰炸德国工业中心。*

Still, Hitler refused to surrender and hid behind his ATLANTIC WALL. Since the outbreak of war, Stalin was demanding an all-out effort to liberate France from German occupation. An invasion force greater than any in the history of the world was slowly amassing in southern Britain toward that end.
尽管如此，希特勒拒绝投降, 并躲在他的大西洋墙后面。战争爆发以来，斯大林要求全力以赴将法国从德国占领下解放出来。为此，一支比世界历史上任何一次都要强大的入侵力量, 正在英国南部慢慢集结。



A great game of espionage soon unfolded. If the Germans could discover when and where the attack would occur, they could simply concentrate all their efforts in one area, and the operation would be doomed to failure. The Allies staged phony exercises meant to confuse German intelligence. Two-dimensional dummy tanks were arranged to distract air surveillance. There was considerable reason to believe the attack would come at CALAIS, where the English Channel is narrowest. In actuality, OPERATION OVERLORD was aiming for the NORMANDY PENINSULA on the morning of June 4, 1944.
一场伟大的间谍游戏很快展开了。如果德国人能发现攻击发生的时间和地点，他们就可以把所有的精力集中在一个地区，而这次盟军的登录行动注定要失败。**盟军进行了虚假的演习，目的是迷惑德国情报部门。**布置二维模拟坦克, 以分散空中监视。有相当多的理由相信，攻击会发生在英吉利海峡最狭窄的"加来"。事实上，“霸王”行动的目标, 是1944年6月4日上午的"诺曼底半岛"。

After D-DAY, the days of the German resistance were numbered. Paris was liberated in August 1944 as the Allies pushed slowly eastward. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was moving into German territory as well. Hitler, at the BATTLE OF THE BULGE, launched a final unsuccessful counteroffensive in December 1944. Soon the Americans, British, and Free French found themselves racing the Soviets to Berlin.
诺曼底登陆之后，德国抵抗的日子就屈指可数了。 1944 年 8 月，随着盟军缓慢向东推进，巴黎获得解放。与此同时，苏联也正在进入德国领土。 1944 年 12 月，希特勒在突出部战役中发动了最后一次反攻，但没有成功。很快，美国、英国和自由法国发现自己正在与苏联争夺柏林。


Following the defeat of the Nazi regime, the full extent of the Holocaust was at last revealed.  Approximately 12,000,000 people were killed between 1933-45.
纳粹政权战败后，大屠杀的全部真相终于被揭露出来。 1933 年至 45 年间，大约有 12,000,000 人被杀。


Along the way they encountered the depths of Nazi horrors when they discovered concentration camps. American soldiers saw humans that looked more like skeletons, gas chambers, crematoriums, and countless victims. Although American government officials were aware of atrocities against Jews, the sheer horror of the Holocaust of 12 million Jews, homosexuals, and anyone else Hitler had deemed deviant was unknown to its fullest extent.
一路上，当他们发现集中营时，他们遭遇了纳粹恐怖的深渊。美国士兵看到的是更像骷髅的人类、毒气室、火化炉以及无数的受害者。尽管美国政府官员知晓对犹太人的暴行，但对1200万犹太人、同性恋者, 以及希特勒视为异常者的大屠杀的真实恐怖程度, 仍然事先不为人知。

When the Allies entered Berlin, they discovered that the mastermind of all the destruction — Adolf Hitler — had already died by his own hand. With little left to sustain any sort of resistance, the Germans surrendered on May 8, 1945, hereafter known as V-E (VICTORY IN EUROPE) DAY.
当盟军进入柏林时，他们发现这一切破坏的主谋——阿道夫·希特勒——已经死在自己的手上了。由于无力维持任何形式的抵抗，德国人于 1945 年 5 月 8 日投降，这一天被称为 V-E（欧洲胜利日）。

The United States Marine Memorial
Located in Arlington, Virginia, this sculpture depicts the raising of the American flag over Iwo Jima and is dedicated to all Marines who have given their life in defense of the United States.
这座雕塑位于弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿，描绘了美国国旗在硫磺岛升起的情景，献给所有为保卫美国而献出生命的海军陆战队员。
Defeating Germany was only part of America's mission.
击败德国只是美国使命的一部分。

Pearl Harbor was only the beginning of Japanese assaults on American holdings in the Pacific. Two days after attacking Pearl Harbor, they seized Guam, and two weeks after that they captured WAKE ISLAND. Before 1941 came to a close, the Philippines came under attack.
珍珠港事件只是日本袭击美国太平洋领土的开始。袭击珍珠港两天后，他们占领了关岛，两周后又占领了威克岛。 1941 年结束之前，菲律宾遭受攻击。

Led by GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR, the Americans were confident they could hold the islands. A fierce Japanese strike proved otherwise. After retreating to strongholds at BATAAN AND CORREGIDOR, the United States had no choice but to surrender the Philippines. Before being summoned away by President Roosevelt, General MacArthur promised: "I SHALL RETURN."
在道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军的领导下，美国人有信心能够守住这些岛屿。日军的猛烈打击证明了事实并非如此。在撤退到巴丹岛和科雷吉多岛的据点后，美国别无选择，只能放弃菲律宾。在被罗斯福总统召回之前，麦克阿瑟将军许诺：“我将会回来。”

Before he returned however, the Japanese inflicted the BATAAN DEATH MARCH, a brutal 85-mile forced on American and Filipino POWs. 16,000 souls perished along the way.
然而，在他返回之前，日本人对美国和菲律宾战俘进行了巴丹死亡行军，这是一次残酷的 85 英里路程。途中有 16,000 人丧生。

Midway Islands
The map inset depicts the movements of both the Japanese and Allied forces during the Battle of Midway in June 1942.
地图插图描绘了 1942 年 6 月中途岛海战期间日军和盟军的行动。
In June 1942, Japan hoped to capture Midway Island, an American held base about 1000 miles from Hawaii. Midway could have been used as a staging point for future attacks on Pearl Harbor. The United States was still benefiting from being able to decipher Japanese radio messages. American naval commanders led by CHESTER NIMITZ therefore knew the assault was coming.
1942 年 6 月，日本希望夺取距离夏威夷约 1000 英里的美国基地中途岛。中途岛可能被用作未来袭击珍珠港的中转站。美国仍然受益于能够破译日本无线电信息。因此，切斯特·尼米兹领导的美国海军指挥官知道袭击即将到来。

Airplane combat decided the BATTLE AT MIDWAY. After the smoke had cleared, four Japanese aircraft carriers had been destroyed. The plot to capture Midway collapsed, and Japan lost much of its offensive capability in the process. After the Battle of Midway, the Japanese were forced to fall back and defend their holdings.
飞机战斗决定了中途岛战役。硝烟散去后，四艘日本航空母舰被摧毁。夺取中途岛的阴谋失败了，日本在此过程中失去了大部分进攻能力。中途岛海战后，日军被迫撤退并保卫自己的据点。

General MacArthur during WWII
In 1941, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was forced to surrender the Philippines, but made his famous promise of "I shall return." Three years later, he made good on his promise to liberate the islands.
1941年，道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军被迫投降菲律宾，但他做出了著名的“我会回来”的承诺。三年后，他兑现了解放岛屿的诺言。
Island hopping was the strategy used by the United States command. Rather than taking every Japanese fortification, the United States selectively chose a path that would move U.S. naval forces closer and closer to the Japanese mainland. In October 1944, MacArthur returned to the Philippines accompanied by a hundred ships and soon the islands were liberated. The capture of IWO JIMA and OKINAWA cleared the way for an all-out assault on Japan. Despite heavy losses, the Japanese refused to surrender. They intensified the attacks on American ships with suicide mission KAMIKAZE flights.
跳岛是美国指挥部使用的策略。美国没有占领日本的所有防御工事，而是有选择地选择了一条让美国海军越来越接近日本本土的道路。 1944年10月，麦克阿瑟率领一百艘舰艇返回菲律宾，很快菲律宾群岛就被解放了。占领硫磺岛和冲绳为全面进攻日本扫清了道路。尽管损失惨重，日军仍拒绝投降。他们利用神风特攻队的自杀式飞机，加强了对美国船只的攻击。

In April 1945, President Roosevelt died of a brain hemorrhage, and HARRY TRUMAN was unexpectedly left to decide the outcome of the war in the Pacific.
1945 年 4 月，罗斯福总统因脑溢血去世，哈里·杜鲁门出人意料地被留下来决定太平洋战争的结果。
