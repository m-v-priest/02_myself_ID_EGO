=== The Gilded Age 镀金时代

.案例
====
.Gilded Age 镀金时代
*处于美国历史中"南北战争"和"进步时代"之间，时间上大概是从1870年代到1900年。* 这个名字取自马克·吐温第一部长篇小说。
====

From the ashes of the American Civil War sprung an economic powerhouse.
从美国内战的废墟中诞生了一个经济强国。


The growth was astounding. From the end of RECONSTRUCTION in 1877 to the disastrous PANIC OF 1893, the American economy nearly doubled in size. New technologies and new ways of organizing business led a few individuals to the top. The competition was ruthless. Those who could not provide the best product at the cheapest price were simply driven into bankruptcy or were bought up by hungry, successful industrialists.
增长是惊人的。从 1877 年重建结束, 到 1893 年灾难性的恐慌，美国经济规模几乎翻了一番。新技术和新的业务组织方式, 让一些人登上了顶峰。竞争是残酷的。那些无法以最便宜的价格提供最好的产品的企业, 要么被迫破产，要么被贪婪、成功的实业家收购。



The so-called captains of industry became household names: John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil, Andrew Carnegie of Carnegie Steel, and J. Pierpont Morgan, the powerful banker who controlled a great many industries. Their tactics were not always fair, but there were few laws regulating business conduct at that time.
所谓的工业领袖, 变得家喻户晓：标准石油公司的约翰·D·洛克菲勒、卡内基钢铁公司的安德鲁·卡内基, 和控制着许多工业的强大银行家J·皮尔庞特·摩根。他们的策略并不总是公平的，但当时很少有法律来规范商业行为。

The "Molly Maguires" were a band of 19th century Irish immigrant laborers who struggled to survive in American industry. They organized labor unions and were not averse to violence, as this "coffin notice," delivered to three bosses, suggests.
“莫莉·马奎尔”是一群 19 世纪的爱尔兰移民劳工，他们在美国工业中挣扎求生。正如这份发给三位老板的“棺材通知”所表明的那样，他们组织了工会，并不反对暴力。




Nevertheless, the American economy grew and grew. By 1914, the small nation once seen as a playground for European empires had now surpassed them all. The United States had become the largest industrial nation in the world.
尽管如此，美国经济却不断增长。到 1914 年，这个曾经被视为欧洲帝国游乐场的小国, 现在已经超越了所有欧洲帝国。美国已成为世界上最大的工业国。

However, the prosperity of America did not reach everyone. Amid the fabulous wealth of the new economic elite was tremendous poverty. How did some manage to be so successful while others struggled to put food on the table? Americans wrestled with this great question as new attitudes toward wealth began to emerge.
**然而，当时美国的繁荣并没有惠及所有人。在新经济精英的巨额财富背后, 却是巨大的贫困。**为什么有些人能够如此成功，而另一些人却只能勉强维持生计？随着新的财富态度开始出现，美国人开始思考这个重大问题。

What role did the government play in this trend? Basically, it was pro-business. Congress, the Presidents, and the Courts looked favorably on this new growth. But leadership was generally lacking on the political level. CORRUPTION spread like a plague through the city, state, and national governments. Greedy legislators and "forgettable" Presidents dominated the political scene.
政府在这一趋势中扮演了什么角色?基本上，它是支持商业的(即支持企业主的)。国会、总统和法院都对这种新的增长持赞成态度。但在政治层面上普遍缺乏领导力。腐败像瘟疫一样在城市、州和国家政府中蔓延。贪婪的立法者和“容易被遗忘的”总统主导了政治舞台。

True leadership, for better or for worse, resided among the magnates who dominated the Gilded Age.
真正的领导权，无论好坏，都掌握在"统治着镀金时代的权贵"手中。

==== Politics of the Gilded Age 镀金时代的政治

The Gilded Age will be remembered for the accomplishments of thousands of American thinkers, inventors, entrepreneurs, writers, and promoters of social justice. Few politicians had an impact on the tremendous change transforming America. The Presidency was at an all-time low in power and influence, and the Congress was rife with corruption. State and city leaders shared in the graft, and the public was kept largely unaware. Much like in the colonial days, Americans were not taking their orders from the top; rather, they were building a new society from its foundation.
**镀金时代, 将因成千上万的美国思想家、发明家、企业家、作家, 和社会正义推动者的成就, 而被铭记。很少有政治家能够对改变美国的巨大变革, 产生影响。总统的权力和影响力处于历史最低水平，国会腐败盛行。**州和市领导人也参与了腐败行为，而公众基本上不知情。*就像在殖民时期一样，美国人不会听从上级的命令; 相反，他们正在从基础上建立一个新社会。*

The American Presidents who resided in the White House from the end of the Civil War until the 1890s are sometimes called "THE FORGETTABLE PRESIDENTS." A case-by-case study helps illustrates this point.
**从内战结束, 到 1890 年代, 一直居住在白宫的美国总统, 有时被称为“被遗忘的总统”。**个案研究有助于说明这一点。

ANDREW JOHNSON was so hated he was impeached and would have been removed from office were it not for a single Senate vote.
安德鲁·约翰逊（Andrew Johnson）如此令人憎恨，他被弹劾，如果没有参议院的一次投票，他就会被免职。

A Soldier in the White House
白宫里的一名士兵
ULYSSES S. GRANT was a war hero but was unprepared for public office. He had not held a single elected office prior to the Presidency and was totally naive to the workings of Washington. He relied heavily on the advice of insiders who were stealing public money. His secretary of war sold Indian land to investors and pocketed public money. His private secretary worked with officials in the Treasury Department to steal money raised from the tax on whiskey.
尤利西斯·s·格兰特是一位战争英雄，但他对担任公职毫无准备。在担任总统之前，他没有担任过任何一个民选公职，对华盛顿的运作完全不了解。他严重依赖"那些窃取公款的内部人士"的建议。他的战争部长, 把印第安人的土地卖给投资者，却把公共资金收入囊中。他的私人秘书与财政部官员合作，窃取从"威士忌税"中所得的钱。

Many members of his Administration were implicated in the CRÉDIT MOBILIER SCANDAL, which defrauded the American public of common land. Grant himself seemed above these scandals, but lacked the political skill to control his staff or replace them with officers of integrity.
他的政府的许多成员都与 CRÉDIT MOBILIER丑闻 有牵连，该丑闻骗取了美国公众的公共土地。格兰特本人似乎不受这些丑闻的影响，但他缺乏政治技巧, 来控制下属, 或用正直的官员取代他们。


.案例
====
.The Crédit Mobilier Scandal 動產信用公司醜聞
受政府委託興建"太平洋鐵路"的動產信用公司（Crédit Mobilier）, 利用其股份, 賄賂總統尤利西斯・辛普森・格蘭特的行政團隊，其中包括副總統、白宮發言人, 以及幾位"眾議院"議員，藉此確保該公司能獲得聯邦政府的支撐, 來完成這項美洲大陸的大型鐵路計劃。該事件始於格蘭特擔任總統前的1867年，卻在1872年才見光。
====


His successor was RUTHERFORD B. HAYES. Hayes himself had tremendous integrity, but his Presidency was weakened by the means of his election. After the electoral votes were counted, his opponent, SAMUEL TILDEN, already claimed a majority of the popular vote and needed just one electoral vote to win. Hayes needed twenty. Precisely twenty electoral votes were in dispute because the states submitted double returns — one proclaiming Hayes the victor, the other Tilden. A Republican-biased electoral commission awarded all 20 electoral votes to the Republican Hayes, and he won by just one electoral vote.
他的继任者是卢瑟福德·B·海斯。海斯本人具有极高的廉正品质，但他的总统任期因选举手段而受到削弱。在选举选票被计算后，他的对手塞缪尔·蒂尔登已经宣称赢得了多数选民的支持，只需再赢得一张选举选票即可获胜。而海斯则需要二十张。恰好有二十张选举选票存在争议，因为各州提交了双份选票——一份宣称海斯获胜，另一份宣称蒂尔登获胜。一个对共和党有利的选举委员会将这二十张选举选票全部授予了共和党的海斯，他最终以仅仅一张选举选票的优势获胜。

While he was able to claim the White House, many considered his election a fraud, and his power to rule was diminished.
虽然他能够入主白宫，但许多人认为他的选举是欺诈，他的统治权力也被削弱了。

Assassination 暗杀
JAMES GARFIELD succeeded Hayes to the Presidency. After only four months, his life was cut short by an assassin's bullet.
詹姆斯·加菲尔德, 接替海斯担任总统。仅仅四个月后，他就被刺客的子弹夺去了生命。


Vice-President CHESTER ARTHUR became the next leader. Although his political history was largely composed of appointments of friends, the tragedy that befell his predecessor led him to believe that the system had gone bad. He signed into law the PENDLETON CIVIL SERVICE ACT, which opened many jobs to competitive exam rather than political connections. The Republican Party rewarded him by refusing his nomination for the Presidency in 1884.
副总统切斯特·阿瑟 (CHESTER ARTHUR) 成为下一任领导人。尽管他的政治历史主要是由朋友任命组成的，但发生在他前任身上的悲剧让他相信这个制度已经变坏了。他签署了《彭德尔顿公务员法》，使许多工作机会进入竞争性考试，而不是靠政治裙带关系。 1884 年，共和党拒绝了他的总统提名，以此作为对他的"奖励"。


.案例
====
.1883年文官制度法
对于阿瑟的任期来说，最大的功绩被认为是改革文官制度。此前，美国政界长期流行“政党分肥制”，根据这种制度，在大选中获胜的党派依据“战利品归胜利者所有”的规则，可以取得政府机构中的各种职位。党的领导人利用这一制度可以用官职来做政治交易，培植亲信。这样，每次大选后，政府人员大量更换。

阿瑟深感这种“分赃”制度的弊端，在他的敦促下，国会在1863年1月16日通过了《彭德尔顿法》。该法禁止在竞选总统时利用政府职位去拉票，并规定政府中10%的职位需通过文官考试聘用人员. 但这一制度仅适用于低级文职人员，至于当选总统任命政府主要人员，仍是按党派关系来选定。

该法自1883年通过以采沿用了近一个世纪，适用范围不断扩大，但基本条文没有什么改变。直至1978年吉米·卡特总统时期，才对条文作了修改。
====

One President impeached, one President drowning in corruption, one President elected by possible fraud, one President assassinated, and one disgraced by his own party for doing what he thought was right. Clearly this was not a good time in Presidential history.
*一位总统被弹劾，一位总统陷入腐败，一位总统因可能存在的舞弊而当选，一位总统被暗杀，一位总统因为做了他认为正确的事情而被自己的政党羞辱。显然，这不是总统历史上的好时机。*



This was an era of CONGRESSIONAL SUPREMACY. The REPUBLICAN PARTY dominated the Presidency and the Congress for most of these years. Both houses of Congress were full of representatives owned by big business.
这是一个"国会至上"的时代。这些年来的大部分时间里，"共和党"在"总统"职位和"国会"中, 占据主导地位。国会参众两院, 都是大企业的代表。

Laws regulating campaigns were minimal and big money bought a government that would not interfere. Similar conditions existed in the states. City governments were dominated by political machines. Members of a small network gained power and used the public treasury to stay in power — and grow fabulously rich in the process.
监管"竞选活动"的法律很少，而大笔资金, 就可以收买到一个"不会进行干预的政府"。类似的情况在各州也存在。市政府被政治机器所控制。一个小圈子网络的成员, 获得了权力，并利用公共财政来维护自己的权力，并在此过程中变得非常富有。

Not until the dawn of the 20th century would serious attempts be made to correct the abuses of Gilded Age government.
直到二十世纪初，人们才认真尝试纠正"镀金时代"政府的弊端。

=== Organized Labor 有组织的劳工

In the mid-19th century, the vast majority of American work was still done on the farm. By the turn of the 20th century, the United States economy revolved around the FACTORY.
19世纪中叶，美国绝大多数工作仍然在农场完成。到了 20 世纪之交，美国经济以工厂为中心。

Most Americans living in the Gilded Age knew nothing of the millions of Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan. They worked 10 hour shifts, 6 days a week, for wages barely enough to survive. Children as young as eight years old worked hours that kept them out of school. Men and women worked until their bodies could stand no more, only to be released from employment without retirement benefits. Medical coverage did not exist. Women who became pregnant were often fired. Compensation for being hurt while on the job was zero.
大多数生活在镀金时代的美国人, 对数以百万计的洛克菲勒、卡内基和摩根一无所知。他们每周工作 6 天，轮班 10 小时，工资勉强维持生计。年仅八岁的儿童因工作时间而无法上学。男人和女人一直工作到身体无法忍受为止，然后才被解雇，没有退休金。不存在医疗保险。怀孕的妇女经常被解雇。在工作中受伤的赔偿为零。



Soon laborers realized that they must unite to demand change. Even though they lacked money, education, or political power, they knew one critical thing. There were simply more workers than there were owners.
*很快，工人们意识到, 他们必须团结起来要求变革。尽管他们缺乏金钱、教育或政治权力，但他们知道一件重要的事情。工人的数量比业主的数量还要多。*

UNIONS did not emerge overnight. Despite their legal rights to exist, bosses often took extreme measures, including intimidation and violence, to prevent a union from taking hold. Workers, too, often chose the sword when peaceful measures failed.
UNIONs 并非一夜之间出现的。尽管老板们拥有合法的生存权利，但他们经常采取极端措施，包括恐吓和暴力，以阻止工会成立。*当和平措施失败时，工人们也常常选择武力。*

Many Americans believed that a violent revolution would take place in America. How long would so many stand to be poor? Industrial titans including John Rockefeller arranged for mighty castles to be built as fortresses to stand against the upheaval they were sure was coming.
**许多美国人相信美国将发生一场暴力革命。**这么多人还要贫穷多久？包括约翰·洛克菲勒在内的工业巨头, 安排建造了宏伟的城堡作为堡垒，以抵御他们确信即将到来的剧变。

Slowly but surely unions did grow. Efforts to form nationwide organizations faced even greater difficulties. Federal troops were sometimes called to block their efforts. Judges almost always ruled in favor of the bosses.
工会确实在缓慢但确定地发展中。组建全国性组织的努力面临着更大的困难。有时联邦军队会被召集来阻止他们的行动。而法官几乎总是做出有利于老板的裁决。

'''

==== 劳工采取的策略

The workers often could not agree on common goals. Some flirted with extreme ideas like Marxism. Others simply wanted a nickel more per hour. Fights erupted over whether or not to admit women or African Americans. Immigrants were often viewed with hostile eyes. Most did agree on one major issue — the eight-hour day. But even that agreement was often not strong enough glue to hold the group together.
**工人们常常无法就共同目标达成一致。**有些人热衷于马克思主义等极端思想。其他人只是想要每小时多赚五分钱。关于是否接纳女性或非裔美国人的争论爆发了。移民常常遭到敌视。*大多数人确实在一个重大问题上达成了一致——八小时工作制。但即使是这样的共识, 也常常不足以将团队凝聚在一起。*

Organized labor has brought tremendous positive change to working Americans. Today, many workers enjoy higher wages, better hours, and safer working conditions. Employers often pay for medical coverage and several weeks vacation. Jobs and lives were lost in the epic struggle for a fair share. The fight sprouted during the Gilded Age, when labor took its first steps toward unity. It began with the Great Upheaval.
**有组织的劳工, 给美国工薪阶层带来了巨大的积极变化。**如今，许多工人享受着更高的工资、更好的工作时间, 和更安全的工作条件 (*所以一切权利都是斗争来的*)。雇主通常支付医疗保险和几周的假期。**在争夺公平份额的史诗般的斗争中，人们失去了工作和生命。**这场斗争在"镀金时代"开始萌芽，*当时"工党"迈出了团结的第一步*。这要从大动乱开始。



The most frequently employed technique of workers was the STRIKE. Withholding labor from management would, in theory, force the company to suffer great enough financial losses that they would agree to worker terms. Strikes have been known in America since the colonial age, but their numbers grew larger in the Gilded Age.
工人最常用的方法是罢工。从理论上讲，拒绝向管理层提供劳动力, 会迫使公司遭受足够大的财务损失，以至于他们会同意工人条款。美国自殖民时代起就开始罢工，但在镀金时代, 罢工的数量变得越来越多。

Most 19th century strikes were not successful, so unions thought of other means. If the workers at a shoe factory could garner enough sympathy from the local townspeople, a BOYCOTT could achieve desirable results. The union would make its case to the town in the hope that no one would buy any shoes from the factory until the owners agreed to a pay raise. Boycotts could be successful in a small community where the factory was dependent upon the business of a group of people in close proximity
**19世纪的大多数罢工, 都没有成功，因此工会想到了其他手段。**如果鞋厂的工人能够获得当地居民足够的同情(即居民和工人联合起来, 对资本家的产品进行抵制)，抵制运动就能取得理想的效果。**工会将向镇上表明立场，希望在工厂主同意加薪之前，没有人会从工厂购买鞋子。**在工厂依赖附近一群人的生意的小社区里，抵制可能会成功.

In desperate times, workers would also resort to illegal means if necessary. For example, SABOTAGE of factory equipment was not unknown. Occasionally, the foreman or the owner might even be the victims of worker-sponsored violence.
**危急时刻，工人们在必要时也会诉诸非法手段。**例如，工厂设备遭到破坏的情况并不鲜见。有时，工头或工厂主, 甚至可能成为工人发起的暴力行为的受害者。

'''

==== 资方采取的策略

Owners had strategies of their own. If a company found itself with a high inventory, the boss might afford to enact a LOCKOUT, which is a reverse strike. In this case, the owner tells the employees not to bother showing up until they agree to a pay cut. Sometimes when a new worker was hired the employee was forced to sign a YELLOW-DOG CONTRACT, or an ironclad oath swearing that the employee would never join a union.
**"工厂主"有自己的策略。如果一家公司发现自己的库存很高，老板可能会实施停工 (直接让员工去放长假, 不给他们活干)，这是一种反向罢工。在这种情况下，老板告诉员工，除非他们同意减薪，否则不要费心想去上班。**有时，当雇用新工人时，雇员被迫签署黄狗合同，或者宣誓该雇员永远不会加入工会。

Strikes could be countered in a variety of ways. The first measure was usually to hire strikebreakers, or SCABS, to take the place of the regular labor force. Here things often turned violent. The crowded cities always seemed to have someone hopeless enough to "CROSS THE PICKET LINE" during a strike. The striking workers often responded with fists, occasionally even leading to death.
**可以通过多种方式来应对罢工。第一项措施通常是雇用"罢工破坏者"(SCABS)来代替正规劳动力。**这里的事情经常演变成暴力。拥挤的城市似乎总有一些绝望的人在罢工期间“越过纠察线”。罢工的工人经常用拳头回击，有时甚至导致死亡。

.案例
====
.Strikebreaker 罢工破坏者
A strikebreaker (sometimes pejoratively called a scab, blackleg, or knobstick) is a person who works despite a strike. Strikebreakers are usually individuals who were not employed by the company before the trade union dispute but hired after or during the strike to keep the organization running. Strikebreakers may also refer to workers (union members or not) who cross picket lines to work.
罢工破坏者（有时被轻蔑地称为工贼、黑腿或旋钮）是指不顾罢工仍坚持工作的人。"罢工破坏者"通常是在工会纠纷发生之前未受公司雇用、但在罢工之后或期间, 受雇以维持组织运转的个人。"罢工破坏者"也可以指跨越纠察线上班的工人（无论是否是工会成员）。

The use of strikebreakers is a worldwide phenomenon; many countries have passed laws outlawing their use to give more power to unionized workers. As of 2002, strikebreakers were used far more frequently in the United States than in other industrialized countries.[1]
使用"罢工破坏者"是一种世界性现象；许多国家已通过法律, 禁止使用这些工具人，以赋予"工会"工人更多权力。
====


Prior to the 20th century the government never sided with the union in a labor dispute. Bosses persuaded the courts to issue injunctions to declare a strike illegal. If the strike continued, the participants would be thrown into prison. When all these efforts failed to break a strike, the government at all levels would be willing to send a militia to regulate as in the case of the Great Upheaval.
20世纪之前，政府在劳资纠纷中, 从未站在"工会"一边。老板们说服法院发布禁令，宣布罢工非法。如果罢工继续下去，参与者将被投入监狱。当这些努力都无法阻止罢工时，各级政府就会像大动乱时那样，愿意派出民兵去镇压。


Divide and conquer. That simple strategy gave the owners the advantage over labor until the dawn of the 20th century. Laborers did not all have the same goals. By favoring one group over another, the bosses could create internal dissent in any union. Unions were spread from town to town. Unity among them might make a more effective boycott or strike, but bringing diverse groups together across a large area was extremely difficult.
**分而治之。**直到 20 世纪初，这种简单的策略, 使资方相对于劳动者具有优势。**劳动者并非都有相同的目标。通过偏袒某一群体而不是另一群体，老板们可能会在任何工会中制造内部分裂。**工会从一个城镇扩展到另一个城镇。他们之间的团结, 可能会使抵制或罢工更有效，但将不同地区的劳工群体聚集在一起, 以形成一个更大的组织, 是非常困难的.

Owners were smart enough to circulate BLACKLISTS. These lists contained the names of any workers active in the union. If anyone on the list would show up in another town trying to get hired (or to start another union), the employers would be wise. Still, the ratio of labor to management was so large that national organization was inevitable. The first group to clear the hurdles was the National Labor Union.
**老板们很聪明，会分发黑名单。这些名单上有工会中所有活跃的工人的名字。如果名单上的人出现在另一个城镇试图找到工作(或成立另一个工会)，那么雇主就知道自己该怎么做了 (全网封杀)。**尽管如此，劳动者与管理层的比例, 仍然如此之大，以至于劳工最终形成"国家规模级别的组织"是不可避免的。第一个扫清障碍的团体, 是"全国工会"。

==== National Labor Union

William Sylvis worked in many trades in his life, from wagon making to canal boat building. Later, he became a pioneer in organizing and motivating labor unions.
威廉·西尔维斯一生从事过许多行业，从马车制造到运河船舶建造。后来，他成为组织和激励工会的先驱。

By 1866, there were about 200,000 workers in local unions across the United States. WILLIAM SYLVIS seized the opportunity presented by these numbers and established the first nationwide labor organization, named the NATIONAL LABOR UNION. Sylvis had very ambitious goals. Not only did the NLU fight for higher wages and shorter hours, Sylvis took labor activity into the political arena. The NLU supported legislation banning PRISON LABOR, land reform laws to keep public holdings out of the hands of speculators, and national currency reform to raise farm prices.
到 1866 年，全美地方工会约有 20 万工人。威廉·西尔维斯抓住了这些数字带来的机遇，建立了第一个全国性劳工组织，名为"全国劳工联盟"。*西尔维斯有非常雄心勃勃的目标。西尔维斯不仅争取更高的工资和更短的工作时间，还将劳工活动带入了政治舞台 (成立劳工自己的政党?)。* NLU 支持"禁止监狱劳动"的立法，"土地改革法"以防止公共财产落入投机者之手，以及"国家货币改革"以提高农产品价格。

It brought together skilled and unskilled workers, as well as farmers. The National Labor Union stopped short of admitting African Americans. RACIST tendencies of the times prevailed, despite the wisdom of bringing as many workers as possible into the fold. Unfortunately for the NLU, it tried to represent too many different groups. Farmers had their own agenda, and skilled workers often had different realities than the unskilled. When the Panic of 1873 hit America, the union was severely disabled. Soon after, the National Labor Union withered away.
它汇集了熟练和非熟练工人以及农民。全国工会没有接纳非裔美国人。尽管让尽可能多的工人加入其中是明智之举，但当时的种族主义倾向仍然盛行。不幸的是，对于 NLU 来说，它试图代表太多不同的群体。农民有自己的议程，熟练工人的现实情况往往与非熟练工人不同。当 1873 年的恐慌袭击美国时，工会严重瘫痪。不久之后，全国工会就消亡了。


'''

==== The KNIGHTS OF LABOR

The KNIGHTS OF LABOR soon inherited the mantle of organized labor. Begun by URIAH STEPHENS as a secret society in 1869, the Knights admitted all wage earners into their ranks, including women and African Americans. The philosophy was simple: class was more important than race or gender. For such a group to influence the federal government, complete solidarity would be required.
劳工骑士团, 很快继承了有组织劳工的衣钵。骑士团由尤利亚·斯蒂芬斯 (URIAH STEPHENS) 于 1869 年创立，是一个秘密社团，接纳所有工薪阶层加入，包括妇女和非裔美国人。这个理念很简单：阶级比种族或性别更重要。对于这样一个团体来说，要影响联邦政府，就需要完全团结起来。

image:/img/Knights-of-Labour.png[,30%]


The Knights supported the entire political agenda of the NLU and more. They advocated limits on immigration, restrictions on child labor, and government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones. At the height of its membership in 1886, the Knights boasted 750,000 workers. But then disaster struck.
骑士团支持 NLU 的整个政治议程等等。他们主张限制移民、限制童工, 以及政府拥有铁路、电报和电话。 1886 年，骑士团成员人数达到顶峰，拥有 75 万名工人。但随后灾难降临了。


On May 1, 1886, INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY, local chapters of the Knights went on strike demanding an eight-hour day for all laborers. At a rally in HAYMARKET SQUARE in Chicago on May 4, someone threw a bomb into the crowd. One police officer died and several crowd members sustained injuries.
1886 年 5 月 1 日，国际劳动节，骑士当地分会举行罢工，要求所有工人实行八小时工作制。 5月4日，在芝加哥HAYMARKET SQUARE的一次集会上，有人向人群扔了一枚炸弹。一名警察死亡，数名人群受伤。

Who was responsible? No one was really sure, but the American press, government, and general public blamed the Knights of Labor. Leader TERENCE POWDERLY condemned the bombing to no avail. Americans associated labor activity with anarchists and mob violence. Membership began to fall. Soon the Knights were merely a shadow of their former size. But labor leaders had learned some valuable lessons. The next national organization of workers would endure.
谁该负责？没有人真正确定，但美国媒体、政府和公众都指责劳工骑士团。领导人特伦斯·鲍德利（TERENCE POWDERLY）谴责爆炸事件，但没有效果。美国人将"劳工活动"与"无政府主义者"和"暴民暴力"联系在一起。成员人数开始下降。很快，骑士队的规模就缩水得只剩下影子了。但劳工领袖已经吸取了一些宝贵的教训。下一个全国工人组织, 将会持续下去。

==== American Federation of Labor 美国劳工联合会

Keep it simple. That was the mantra of labor leader SAMUEL GOMPERS. He was a diehard capitalist and saw no need for a radical restructuring of America. Gompers quickly learned that the issues that workers cared about most deeply were personal. They wanted higher wages and better working conditions. These "BREAD AND BUTTER" issues would always unite the labor class. By keeping it simple, unions could avoid the pitfalls that had drawn the life from the National Labor Union and the Knights of Labor.
保持简单。这是劳工领袖SAMUEL GOMPERS的口头禅。他是一个顽固的资本家，认为没有必要对美国进行彻底的重组。龚帕斯很快了解到，工人们最关心的问题都是个人问题。他们要求提高工资和改善工作条件。这些“面包和黄油”的问题总是会把工人阶级团结起来。通过保持简单，工会可以避免陷入国家工会和劳工骑士团的陷阱。


In December of 1886, the same year the Knights of Labor was dealt its fatal blow at Haymarket Square, Gompers met with the leaders of other craft unions to form the AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR. The A.F. of L. was a loose grouping of smaller craft unions, such as the masons' union, the hatmakers' union or Gompers's own cigarmakers' union. Every member of the A.F. of L. was therefore a skilled worker.
1886年12月，也就是劳工骑士团在干草市场广场遭受致命打击的那一年，龚帕斯与其他行业工会的领导人会面，成立了美国劳工联合会。美国劳工联合会是一个松散的小型行业工会组织，比如泥瓦匠工会、制帽商工会, 或龚帕斯自己的雪茄制造商工会。因此，劳联的每一个成员都是熟练工人。

image:/img/American Federation of Labor.jpg[,20%]


Gompers had no visions of uniting the entire working class. Tradespeople were in greater demand and already earned higher wages than their unskilled counterparts. Gompers knew that the A.F. of L. would have more political and economic power if unskilled workers were excluded. He served as president of the union every year except one until his death in 1924.
龚帕斯没有把整个工人阶级团结起来的想法。手艺人的需求量更大，他们的工资已经高于非熟练工人。龚帕斯知道，如果非技术工人被排除在外，劳联将拥有更大的政治和经济力量。除了一年之外，他每年都担任工会主席，直到1924年去世。

Although conservative in nature, Gompers was not afraid to call for a strike or a boycott. The larger A.F. of L. could be used to support these actions, as well as provide relief for members engaged in a work stoppage. By refusing to pursue a radical program for political change, Gompers maintained the support of the American government and public. By 1900, the ranks of the A.F. of L. swelled to over 500,000 tradespeople. Gompers was seen as the unofficial leader of the labor world in America.
尽管冈帕斯生性保守，但他并不害怕号召罢工或抵制。更大的美国劳工联合会可以用来支持这些行动，并为参与停工的成员提供救济。由于拒绝推行激进的政治变革计划，龚帕斯得到了美国政府和公众的支持。到1900年，美国劳工联合会的队伍, 扩大到超过50万名手艺人。龚帕斯被视为美国劳工界的非官方领袖。

Simplicity worked. Although the bosses still had the upper hand with the government, unions were growing in size and status. There were over 20,000 strikes in America in the last two decades of the 19th century. Workers lost about half, but in many cases their demands were completely or partially met. The A.F. of L. served as the preeminent national labor organization until the Great Depression when unskilled workers finally came together. Smart leadership, patience, and realistic goals made life better for the hundreds of thousands of working Americans it served.
简单有效。尽管老板们在政府面前仍然占上风，但工会的规模和地位都在增长。在19世纪的最后20年里，美国发生了2万多起罢工。其中大约有一半, 工人们失败了，但在许多情况下，他们的要求完全或部分得到了满足。美国劳工联合会一直是最杰出的全国劳工组织，直到大萧条时期，非技术工人终于团结起来。聪明的领导，耐心, 和现实的目标, 使成千上万的美国工薪阶层的生活变得更好。

==== Eugene V. Debs and American Socialism 尤金·V·德布斯和美国社会主义


Despite the success of the American Federation of Labor, American RADICALISM was not dead. The number of those who felt the American capitalist system was fundamentally flawed was in fact growing fast.
尽管"美国劳工联合会"取得了成功，但美国"激进主义"并未消亡。事实上，认为美国资本主义制度存在根本缺陷的人, 数量正在快速增长。

American SOCIALISTS based their beliefs on the writings of KARL MARX, the German philosopher. Many asked why so many working Americans should have so little while a few owners grew incredibly wealthy. No wealth could exist without the sweat and blood of its workforce. They suggested that the government should own all industries and divide the profits among those who actually created the products. While the current management class would stand to lose, many more people would gain. These radicals grew in number as industries spread. But their enemies were legion.
美国社会主义者的信仰基于德国哲学家卡尔·马克思的著作。许多人问，为什么如此多的美国工薪阶层拥有的如此之少，而少数业主却变得异常富有。没有劳动力的汗水和鲜血，就不可能有任何财富。他们建议政府应该拥有所有行业(公有制)，并将利润分配给实际创造产品的人。虽然当前的管理阶层可能会遭受损失，但更多的人将会受益。随着工业的扩展，这些激进分子的数量不断增加。但他们的敌人数量众多。

The Father of American Socialism
美国"社会主义"之父

EUGENE V. DEBS was born in Terre Haute, Indiana in 1855 to a family of French Alsatian immigrants. Making his way in the railroad industry, Debs formed the AMERICAN RAILWAY UNION in 1892.
尤金·V·德布斯 (EUGENE V. DEBS) 1855 年出生于印第安纳州特雷霍特的一个法国阿尔萨斯移民家庭。德布斯在铁路行业崭露头角，于 1892 年成立了美国铁路联盟。

Two years later he found himself leading one of the largest strikes in American history — the great PULLMAN STRIKE.
两年后，他发现自己领导了美国历史上最大的罢工之一——伟大的普尔曼罢工 (罢工后来失败)。

Debs was not originally a socialist, but his experience with the Pullman Strike and his subsequent six-month jail term led him to believe that drastic action was necessary. Debs chose to confine his activity to the political arena. In 1900 he ran for President as a socialist and garnered some 87,000 votes.
德布斯原本并不是社会主义者，但他在普尔曼罢工中的经历, 以及随后的六个月监禁, 使他相信采取严厉行动是必要的。德布斯选择将他的活动限制在政治领域。 1900年，他作为"社会党人"竞选总统，获得约87,000张选票。



The following year, leading sympathizers joined with him to form the SOCIALIST PARTY. At its height, the party numbered over 100,000 active members. Debs ran for President four more times. In the election of 1912 he received over 900,000 votes. After being arrested for antiwar activities during World War I, he ran for President from his jail cell and polled 919,000 votes. Debs died in 1926 having never won an election, but over one thousand Socialist Party members were elected to state and city governments.
次年，**主要同情者与他一起组建了"社会党"。**该党在鼎盛时期拥有超过10万名活跃党员。**德布斯又四次竞选总统。**在 1912 年的选举中，他获得了超过 90 万张选票。第一次世界大战期间因反战活动被捕后，他从牢房里竞选总统，并获得了 919,000 票。德布斯于 1926 年去世，*从未赢得过选举，但有超过 1000 名社会党成员当选为州和市政府成员。*
