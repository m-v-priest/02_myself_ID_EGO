== 解说

=== The Great Depression 大萧条


At the end of the 1920s, the United States boasted the largest economy in the world. With the destruction wrought by World War I, Europeans struggled while Americans flourished. Upon succeeding to the Presidency, Herbert Hoover predicted that the United States would soon see the day when poverty was eliminated. Then, in a moment of apparent triumph, everything fell apart. The stock market crash of 1929 touched off a chain of events that plunged the United States into its longest, deepest economic crisis of its history.
20世纪20年代末，美国号称是世界上最大的经济体。**由于第一次世界大战造成的破坏，欧洲人苦苦挣扎，而美国人则蓬勃发展。**赫伯特·胡佛继任总统后预言，美国很快就会看到消除贫困的那一天。然后，在表面上的胜利时刻，一切都崩溃了。 *1929 年的股市崩盘引发了一系列事件，使美国陷入了历史上最长、最严重的经济危机。*


Nine thousand banks failed during the months following the stock market crash of 1929.
1929 年股市崩盘后的几个月里，有 9000 家银行倒闭。

It is far too simplistic to view the stock market crash as the single cause of the Great Depression. A healthy economy can recover from such a contraction. Long-term underlying causes sent the nation into a downward spiral of despair. First, American firms earned record profits during the 1920s and reinvested much of these funds into expansion. By 1929, companies had expanded to the bubble point. Workers could no longer continue to fuel further expansion, so a slowdown was inevitable. While corporate profits, skyrocketed, wages increased incrementally, which widened the distribution of wealth.
如果将股市崩盘视为大萧条的单一原因，那就太简单化了。健康的经济可以从这种收缩中复苏。长期的根本原因使国家陷入绝望的螺旋式下降。首先，**美国公司在 20 年代获得了创纪录的利润，并将大部分资金再投资于扩张。到 1929 年，公司规模已达到泡沫点。工人无法再继续推动进一步扩张，因此经济放缓是不可避免的。**在企业利润猛增的同时，工资也逐渐增加，从而扩大了财富的分配。

The richest one percent of Americans owned over a third of all American assets. Such wealth concentrated in the hands of a few limits economic growth. The wealthy tended to save money that might have been put back into the economy if it were spread among the middle and lower classes. Middle class Americans had already stretched their debt capacities by purchasing automobiles and household appliances on installment plans.
最富有的百分之一的美国人, 拥有美国全部资产的三分之一以上。这种财富集中在少数人手中限制了经济增长。**富人倾向于存钱，如果这些钱分散到中下阶层，这些钱本可以重新投入到经济中。**美国中产阶级在购买汽车和家用电器时,已经通过"分期付款"方式, 来增加自己的偿债能力。

The American way?
The unprecedented prosperity of the 1920s was suddenly gone, the Great Depression was upon the nation, and breadlines became a common sight.
20 年代空前的繁荣突然消失，大萧条降临到全国，排队领取救济金的现象司空见惯。

There were fundamental structural weaknesses in the American economic system. Banks operated without guarantees to their customers, creating a climate of panic when times got tough. Few regulations were placed on banks and they lent money to those who speculated recklessly in stocks. Agricultural prices had already been low during the 1920s, leaving farmers unable to spark any sort of recovery. When the Depression spread across the Atlantic, Europeans bought fewer American products, worsening the slide.
**美国经济体系, 存在根本性的"结构性弱点"。银行在没有向客户提供担保的情况下运营，**在困难时期造成恐慌气氛。*对银行的监管很少，它们把钱借给那些不顾一切地炒股的人。* 20 年代农产品价格已经很低，导致农民无法激发任何形式的复苏。*当大萧条蔓延到大西洋彼岸时，欧洲人购买的美国产品减少，导致经济下滑更加严重。(不但内需不振, 连外贸也没了)*

When President Hoover was inaugurated, the American economy was a house of cards. Unable to provide the proper relief from hard times, his popularity decreased as more and more Americans lost their jobs. His minimalist approach to government intervention made little impact . The economy shrank with each successive year of his Presidency. As middle class Americans stood in the same soup lines previously graced only by the nation's poorest, the entire social fabric of America was forever altered.
胡佛总统就职时，美国经济是纸牌屋。由于无法为困难时期提供适当的缓解，随着越来越多的美国人失业，他的受欢迎程度下降了。他对政府干预的极简主义做法, 收效甚微。在他担任总统期间，经济逐年萎缩。当美国的中产阶级站在以前只有美国最穷的人才能享受到的同一"排汤队"时，美国的整个社会结构永远改变了。

==== The Market Crashes 市场崩溃


It was a boom time for the STOCKHOLDER. STOCK PRICES soared to record levels. Millionaires were made overnight. Sound like the stock market of the 1990s? Try the New York Stock Exchange on the eve of the GREAT CRASH in 1929.
对于股东来说，这是一个繁荣时期。股票价格飙升至创纪录水平。百万富翁是一夜之间成为的。听起来像 20 世纪 90 年代的股市吗？试试 1929 年大崩盘前夕的纽约证券交易所吧。

Although the 1920s were marked by growth in stock values, the last four years saw an explosion in the market. In 1925, the total value of the NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE was $27 billion. By September 1929, that figure skyrocketed to $87 billion. This means that the average stockholder more than tripled the value of the stock portfolio he or she was lucky enough to possess.
尽管 20 年代的特点是"股票价值增长"，但过去四年, 市场出现了爆炸式增长。 *1925年，纽约证券交易所的总市值为270亿美元。到 1929 年 9 月，这个数字飙升至 870 亿美元。这意味着普通股东所拥有的股票投资组合的价值增加了​​两倍多。*



Fueling the rapid expansion was the risky practice of buying stock on margin. A MARGIN PURCHASE allows an investor to borrow money, typically as much as 75% of the purchase price, to buy a greater amount of stock. Stockbrokers and even banks funded the reckless SPECULATOR. Borrowers were often willing to pay 20% interest rates on loans, being dead certain that the risk would be worth the rewards. The lender was so certain that the market would rise that such transactions became commonplace, despite warnings by the Federal Reserve Board against the practice. Clearly, there had to be a limit to how high the market could reach.
以保证金购买股票的高风险做法, 推动了公司的快速扩张。**保证金购买, 允许投资者借钱（通常高达购买价格的 75%）来购买更多股票。股票经纪人, 甚至银行, 都为鲁莽的投机者提供了资金。借款人通常愿意支付 20% 的贷款利率，因为他们确信风险值得回报。**尽管联邦储备委员会警告不要这样做，但贷方非常确信市场会上涨，因此此类交易变得司空见惯。显然，市场能达到的高度必须有一个限制。

Stock prices, 1921-40
On October 24, 1929, a day that came to be known as Black Thursday, investors began to sell their stocks at an alarming rate. By October 29, the Great Crash was underway, and by November 17, over $30 billion dollars had disappeared from the U.S. economy. In the chart above, the horizontal axis represents the years 1921-40, and the vertical axis represents the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
1929 年 10 月 24 日，这一天被称为“黑色星期四”，投资者开始以惊人的速度抛售股票。到 10 月 29 日，大崩溃已经开始，到 11 月 17 日，超过 300 亿美元从美国经济中消失。在上图中，横轴代表 1921-40 年，纵轴代表道琼斯工业平均指数。

What causes stock prices to fall? Although the workings of the New York Stock Exchange can be quite complex, one simple principle governs the price of stock. When investors believe a stock is a good value they are willing to pay more for a share and its value rises. When traders believe the value of a security will fall, they cannot sell it at as high of a price. If all investors try to sell their shares at once and no one is willing to buy, the value of the market shrinks.
是什么导致股价下跌？尽管纽约证券交易所的运作可能相当复杂，但有一个简单的原则控制着股票价格。当投资者相信股票具有良好的价值时，他们愿意为股票支付更多费用，其价值就会上升。当交易者认为证券的价值将会下跌时，他们就无法以那么高的价格出售它。*如果所有投资者都试图立即出售其股票, 而没有人愿意购买，那么市场价值就会缩水。*

Wealthy investors like J.P. Morgan hoped to stop the crash by pooling their resources and buying up large amounts of stock.
摩根大通等富有的投资者, 希望通过集中资源购买大量股票, 来阻止股市崩盘。

On October 24, 1929, "BLACK THURSDAY," this massive sell-a-thon began. By the late afternoon, wealthy financiers like J.P. Morgan pooled their resources and began to buy stocks in the hopes of reversing the trend.
1929 年 10 月 24 日，“黑色星期四”，这场大规模的销售马拉松开始了。到了下午晚些时候，摩根大通等富有的金融家集中资源开始购买股票，希望扭转这一趋势。

But the bottom fell out of the market on Tuesday, October 29. A record 16 million shares were exchanged for smaller and smaller values as the day progressed. For some stocks, no buyers could be found at any price. By the end of the day, panic had erupted, and the next few weeks continued the downward spiral. In a matter of ten short weeks the value of the entire market was cut in half. Suicide and despair swept the investing classes of America.
但 10 月 29 日星期二，市场触底。随着交易日的推移，创纪录的 1600 万股股票的交易价值越来越小。对于某些股票，无论价格如何, 都找不到买家。到当天结束时，恐慌已经爆发，接下来的几周继续呈螺旋式下降。短短十周内，整个市场的价值就减半了。自杀和绝望席卷了美国的投资阶层。

==== Sinking Deeper and Deeper: 1929-33    /越陷越深：1929-33


When the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, few Americans believed that a decade long depression was underway. After all, only 4 million Americans had money invested on Wall Street. 90% of American households owned precisely zero shares of stock. President Herbert Hoover quickly addressed the nation, professing his faith in the soundness of the American economy. But soothing words were clearly not enough to stop the shrinking of a deeply flawed national economic system.
1929 年 10 月 29 日股市崩盘时，很少有美国人相信**长达 10 年的萧条正在到来。**毕竟，只有 400 万美国人有钱投资于华尔街。 90% 的美国家庭拥有的股票恰好为零。赫伯特·胡佛总统迅速向全国发表讲话，表达了他对美国经济稳健的信心。但安慰的话, 显然不足以阻止存在严重缺陷的国民经济体系的萎缩。

The stock market crash had many short-term consequences. Banks that improvidently lent money to futures traders to buy stock on margin found that many of those loans would go unpaid. Consequently, a rash of BANK FAILURES swept the nation. This had a tremendous ripple effect on the economy. If a working-class family was unfortunate enough to have their savings held in trust by a failed bank — too bad for them, all their money was lost.
股市崩盘产生了许多短期后果。*那些轻率地向期货交易商借钱, 用"保证金"购买股票的银行发现，其中许多贷款都无法偿还。结果，银行倒闭潮席卷全国。这对经济产生了巨大的连锁反应。如果一个工人阶级家庭不幸将他们的积蓄交给一家倒闭的银行托管——对他们来说太糟糕了，他们所有的钱都会损失殆尽。*

As Americans saw banks close and savings disappear, less money was spent on goods and services. Many consumers who had bought the new conveniences of the GOLDEN TWENTIES on the installment plan were unable to make their payments. Businesses began to lay off workers to offset new losses. Many manufacturers had overproduced and created huge inventories.
*随着美国人看到银行关闭、储蓄消失，花在商品和服务上的钱减少了。许多用分期付款方式购买了“黄金1920年代”新便利产品的消费者, 无法付款。企业开始裁员以抵消新的损失。许多制造商生产过剩，造成大量库存。(即经济运作的整个链条, 被'连锁反应'瘫痪了. 经济的运作, 就像一个链条, 里面是一环套一环的,只要有一环瘫痪停下来, 整个链条也就瘫痪了.)*

Unemployment brought even less savings and spending, and the economy slowed yet another notch. The downward spiral continued into 1933. The $87 billion 1929 New York Stock Exchange was worth a mere $15 billion in 1932. UNEMPLOYMENT rose from 1.5 million Americans in 1929 to a debilitating 12 million in 1932.
**失业导致储蓄和支出减少，经济进一步放缓。这种螺旋式下降一直持续到 1933 年。**1929 年价值 870 亿美元的纽约证券交易所, 在 1932 年仅值 150 亿美元。*美国失业人数, 从 1929 年的 150 万, 增加到 1932 年的 1200 万。*

Despair swept the nation. In addition to the nationwide 25% unemployment rate, many laborers were forced to choose between wage cuts and a PINK SLIP. Most people who retained their jobs saw their incomes shrink by a third. SOUP KITCHENS and CHARITY LINES, previously unknown to the middle class, were unable to meet the growing demand for food.
绝望席卷全国。除了全国25%的失业率之外，**许多劳动者被迫在"减薪"和"解雇通知"之间做出选择。**大多数保住了工作的人的收入, 减少了三分之一。以前中产阶级不知道的汤厨房和慈善热线, 无法满足日益增长的食品需求。

Desperate for income, thousands performed odd jobs from taking in laundry to collecting and selling apples on the street. College professors in New York City drove taxicabs to make ends meet. Citizens of Washington State lit forest fires in the hopes of earning a few bucks extinguishing them. Millions of backyard gardens were cultivated to grow vegetables.
**由于急需收入，数千人不得不"打零工"，**从洗衣服, 到在街上捡苹果和卖苹果。纽约市的大学教授靠开出租车维持生计。华盛顿州的公民点燃森林大火，希望通过扑灭大火赚点钱。数以百万计的后院花园, 被用来种植蔬菜。



Americans prowled landfills waiting for the next load of refuse to arrive in the hopes of finding a few table scraps among the trash.
美国人在"垃圾填埋场"徘徊，等待下一批垃圾到达，希望能在垃圾中找到一些餐桌残渣。

The strife was uneven across the land. Oklahoma was particularly hard hit, as a DROUGHT brought dry winds, kicking up a "DUST BOWL" that forced thousands to migrate westward. African Americans endured unemployment rates of nearly twice the white communities, as African American workers were often the last hired and the first fired. Mexican Americans in California were offered free one-way trips back to Mexico to decrease job competition in the state. The Latino population of the American Southwest sharply decreased throughout the decade, as ethnic violence increased.
全国各地的冲突并不平衡。俄克拉荷马州受到的打击尤其严重，因为干旱带来了干燥的风，引发了“沙尘暴”，迫使数千人向西迁移。**非裔美国人的失业率, 几乎是白人社区的两倍，因为非裔美国工人往往是最后被雇用、最先被解雇的。**加利福尼亚州的墨西哥裔美国人, 获得了返回墨西哥的免费单程旅行，以减少该州的就业竞争。十年来，随着种族暴力的增加，美国西南部的拉丁裔人口急剧减少。

As the days and weeks of the GREAT DEPRESSION turned into months and years, Americans began to organize their discontent.
随着大萧条的日子, 从"几周"变成了"几个月和几年"，美国人开始组织他们的不满情绪。

==== The Bonus March 奖金进行曲


Many in America wondered if the nation would survive.
许多美国人想知道, 这个国家还能否生存下去。

Although the United States had little history of massive social upheaval or coup attempts against the government, hunger has an ominous way of stirring those passions among any population. As bread riots and shantytowns grew in number, many began to seek alternatives to the status quo. Demonstrations in the nation's capital increased, as Americans grew increasingly weary with President Hoover's perceived inaction. The demonstration that drew the most national attention was the BONUS ARMY MARCH of 1932.
尽管美国几乎没有发生过大规模社会动乱, 或反对政府的政变的历史，但饥饿却以一种不祥的方式, 激起了任何人的激情。随着面包骚乱, 和棚户区数量的增加，许多人开始寻求改变现状的替代方案。**随着美国人对胡佛总统的无所作为, 越来越感到厌倦，首都的示威活动有所增加。**最引起全国关注的示威活动是 1932 年的红军游行。

In 1924, Congress rewarded VETERANS of WORLD WAR I with certificates redeemable in 1945 for $1,000 each. By 1932, many of these former servicemen had lost their jobs and fortunes in the early days of the Depression. They asked Congress to redeem their BONUS CERTIFICATES early.
1924 年，国会向第一次世界大战退伍军人, 颁发了可在 1945 年兑换的证书，每张价值 1,000 美元。到 1932 年，许多退伍军人在大萧条初期失去了工作和财产。他们要求国会尽早兑现他们的奖金证书。


Led by WALTER WATERS of Oregon, the so-called Bonus Expeditionary Force set out for the nation's capital. Hitching rides, hopping trains, and hiking finally brought the Bonus Army, now 15,000 strong, into the capital in June 1932. Although President Hoover refused to address them, the veterans did find an audience with a congressional delegation. Soon a debate began in the Congress over whether to meet the demonstrators' demands.
在俄勒冈州的沃尔特·沃特斯的率领下，所谓的“红利远征军”向国家首都进发。 1932 年 6 月，搭便车、跳火车和徒步旅行, 最终将现有 15,000 人的红利军带入首都。尽管胡佛总统拒绝向他们发表讲话，但退伍军人确实会见了国会代表团。很快，国会就是否满足示威者的要求, 展开了辩论。

====

As deliberation continued on Capitol Hill, the Bonus Army built a SHANTYTOWN across the Potomac River in ANACOSTIA FLATS. When the Senate rejected their demands on June 17, most of the veterans dejectedly returned home. But several thousand remained in the capital with their families. Many had nowhere else to go. The Bonus Army conducted itself with decorum and spent their vigil unarmed.
随着国会山审议的继续，红利军在波托马克河对岸的阿纳科斯蒂亚公寓, 建造了一个棚户区。当参议院于 6 月 17 日拒绝他们的要求时，大多数退伍军人垂头丧气地回家了。但仍有数千人和家人留在首都。许多人无处可去。奖金军举止得体，守夜时没有携带武器。



However, many believed them a threat to national security. On July 28, Washington police began to clear the demonstrators out of the capital. Two men were killed as tear gas and bayonets assailed the Bonus Marchers. Fearing rising disorder, Hoover ordered an army regiment into the city, under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur. The army, complete with infantry, cavalry, and tanks, rolled into Anacostia Flats forcing the Bonus Army to flee. MacArthur then ordered the shanty settlements burned.
然而，许多人认为他们对国家安全构成威胁。 7月28日，华盛顿警方开始将示威者驱离首都。奖金游行者遭到催泪瓦斯和刺刀袭击，两名男子被杀。由于担心混乱加剧，胡佛命令一个军团在道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军的领导下, 进入该市。这支军队，包括步兵、骑兵和坦克，开进了阿纳科斯蒂亚平原，迫使红军逃跑。麦克阿瑟随后下令烧毁棚户区。

Many Americans were outraged. How could the army treat veterans of the Great War with such disrespect? Hoover maintained that political agitators, anarchists, and communists dominated the mob. But facts contradict his claims. Nine out of ten Bonus Marchers were indeed veterans, and 20% were disabled. Despite the fact that the Bonus Army was the largest march on Washington up to that point in history, Hoover and MacArthur clearly overestimated the threat posed to national security. As Hoover campaigned for reelection that summer, his actions turned an already sour public opinion of him even further bottomward.
**许多美国人感到愤怒。军队怎么能如此不尊重一战老兵呢？**胡佛坚持认为，政治煽动者、无政府主义者, 和共产主义者, 主导了暴民。但事实与他的说法相矛盾。十个奖励游行者中, 有九个确实是退伍军人，其中 20% 是残疾人。尽管“红利军”是迄今为止历史上规模最大的华盛顿进军，但胡佛和麦克阿瑟, 显然高估了对国家安全构成的威胁。那年夏天，当胡佛竞选连任时，他的行为使公众对他本已恶劣的看法, 进一步恶化。

America sank deeper in Depression.
美国在大萧条中, 越陷越深。

==== Hoover's Last Stand 胡佛的最后一战



PRESIDENT HERBERT HOOVER had the distinction of stepping into the White House at the height of one of the longest periods of growth in American history. Less than seven months after his inauguration, the worst depression in American history began.
赫伯特·胡佛总统, 有幸在美国历史上最长的经济增长时期之一的鼎盛时期, 入主白宫。他就职后不到七个月，美国历史上最严重的萧条开始了。

Undoubtedly, the fault of the Great Depression was not Hoover's. But as the years of his Presidency passed and the country slipped deeper and deeper into its quagmire, he would receive great blame. Urban shantytowns were dubbed HOOVERVILLES. Newspapers used by the destitute as bundling for warmth became known as Hoover blankets. Pockets turned inside out were called Hoover flags. Somebody had to be blamed, and many Americans blamed their President.
毫无疑问，大萧条的过错不是胡佛的。但随着他担任总统的岁月流逝，国家在泥潭中越陷越深，他将受到巨大的指责。城市棚户区被称为“胡佛维尔”。穷人用来捆绑取暖的报纸, 被称为胡佛毯子。翻过来的口袋被称为胡佛旗。必须有人受到指责，许多美国人指责他们的总统。

Running for President under the slogan "RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM" made it difficult for Hoover to promote massive government intervention in the economy. In 1930, succumbing to pressure from American industrialists, Hoover signed the HAWLEY-SMOOT TARIFF which was designed to protect American industry from overseas competition. Passed against the advice of nearly every prominent economist of the time, it was the largest TARIFF in American history.
以“粗犷的个人主义”为竞选口号的胡佛, 很难推动政府对经济的大规模干预。1930年，迫于美国实业家的压力，胡佛签署了《霍利-斯穆特关税法案》，旨在保护美国工业免受海外竞争的影响。这是美国历史上规模最大的关税，完全违背了当时几乎所有著名经济学家的建议。

.The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act 斯姆特-霍利关税法案
是一项在美国实施"保护主义贸易政策"的法律. 于1930年6月17日, 经赫伯特·胡佛总统签署成为法律，**该法案将20000多种的进口商品的关税, 提升到历史最高水平。许多国家对美国采取了报复性关税措施*, 令世界贸易规模发生了萎缩。

虽然该法案是在1929年股市大崩盘之后通过的，但是部分经济历史学家认为, 该法案进一步导致1929年的衰退。

1945年12月，一轮遍及全球的大规模削减关税行动实施；五十年代，关税及贸易总协定组织建立。
====



The amount of protection received by industry did not offset the losses brought by a decrease in foreign trade. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff proved to be a disaster. Believing in a balanced budget, Hoover's 1931 economic plan cut federal spending and increased taxes, both of which inhibited individual efforts to spur the economy.
*工业获得的保护数额, 并不能抵消外贸下降带来的损失。霍利-斯穆特关税, 被证明是一场灾难。胡佛 1931 年的经济计划, 相信预算平衡，因此削减了联邦支出并增加了税收，这两者都抑制了个人刺激经济的努力。(即 gdp= c+i+g+nx 中的 g 和 nx, 都降低了)*



Finally in 1932 Hoover signed legislation creating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. This act allocated a half billion dollars for loans to banks, corporations, and state governments. Public works projects such as the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE and the Los Angeles Aqueduct were built as a result of this plan.
最终，胡佛于 1932 年签署了创建重建金融公司的立法。该法案拨出五亿美元用于向银行、企业和州政府提供贷款。金门大桥和洛杉矶渡槽等公共工程项目, 就是根据该计划建造的。

Hoover and the RFC stopped short of meeting one demand of the American masses — federal aid to individuals. Hoover believed that government aid would stifle initiative and create dependency where individual effort was needed. Past governments never resorted to such schemes and the economy managed to rebound. Clearly Hoover and his advisors failed to grasp the scope of the Great Depression.
**胡佛和 RFC , 未能满足美国群众的一项要求——对个人的联邦援助。胡佛认为，政府援助会扼杀主动​​性，并在需要个人努力的地方产生依赖性。**过去的政府从未采取过此类计划，经济也成功反弹。显然，胡佛和他的顾问们未能掌握大萧条的范围。



The stage was set for the ELECTION OF 1932. New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt won the Democratic nomination on the fourth ballot of their national convention. Roosevelt promised "a new deal for the American people" that included a repeal of the prohibition amendment. The Republicans renominated Hoover, perhaps because there were few other interested GOP candidates.
1932 年选举的舞台已经搭建完毕。纽约州州长富兰克林·D·罗斯福, 在全国代表大会第四次投票中, 赢得了民主党提名。罗斯福承诺“为美国人民制定一项新政”，其中包括废除"禁酒令修正案"。共和党重新提名胡佛，也许是因为几乎没有其他感兴趣的共和党候选人。

Election day brought a landslide for the Democrats, as Roosevelt earned 58% of the popular vote and 89% of the electoral vote, handing the Republicans their second-worst defeat in their history. Bands across America struck up Roosevelt's theme song — "HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN" — as millions of Americans looked with hope toward their new leader.
选举日，民主党取得压倒性胜利，罗斯福赢得了 58% 的普选票, 和 89% 的选举人票，让共和党遭遇了历史上第二惨重的失败。美国各地的乐队演奏了罗斯福的主题曲——“快乐的日子又来了”——数百万美国人满怀希望地看着他们的新领导人。

==== Social and Cultural Effects of the Depression 大萧条的社会和文化影响


No nation could emerge from the cauldron of national crisis without profound social and cultural changes. While many undesirable vices associated with hopelessness were on the rise, many family units were also strengthened through the crisis. MASS MIGRATIONS reshaped the American mosaic. While many businesses perished during the Great Depression, others actually emerged stronger. And new forms of expression flourished in the culture of despair.
如果没有深刻的社会和文化变革，任何国家都无法走出民族危机的深渊。**尽管许多与绝望相关的不良恶习, 正在增加，但许多家庭单位, 也在危机中得到了加强。**大规模移民重塑了美国的格局。*虽然许多企业在大萧条期间倒闭，但其他企业, 实际上变得更加强大。新的表达形式, 在绝望文化中蓬勃发展。*

The Great Depression brought a rapid rise in the CRIME RATE as many unemployed workers resorted to petty theft to put food on the table. Suicide rates rose, as did reported cases of malnutrition. Prostitution was on the rise as desperate women sought ways to pay the bills. Health care in general was not a priority for many Americans, as visiting the doctor was reserved for only the direst of circumstances. Alcoholism increased with Americans seeking outlets for escape, compounded by the repeal of prohibition in 1933. Cigar smoking became too expensive, so many Americans switched to cheaper cigarettes.
**大萧条, 导致犯罪率迅速上升，**因为许多失业工人通过小偷小摸, 来维持生计。自杀率上升，据报道的营养不良病例也在上升。**随着绝望的妇女寻找支付账单的方法，卖淫活动呈上升趋势。**一般来说，医疗保健对于许多美国人来说, 并不是优先考虑的事情，因为只有在最糟糕的情况下才会去看医生。随着美国人寻找出路，酗酒现象日益增多，1933 年禁酒令的废除更是雪上加霜。吸雪茄变得太贵了，因此许多美国人转而购买更便宜的香烟。

Higher education remained out of reach for most Americans as the nation's universities saw their student bodies shrink during the first half of the decade. High school attendance increased among males, however. Because the prospects of a young male getting a job were so incredibly dim, many decided to stay in school longer. However, public spending on education declined sharply, causing many schools to open understaffed or close due to lack of funds.
对于大多数美国人来说，高等教育仍然遥不可及，因为美国大学的学生人数, 在这十年的前五年里不断萎缩。然而，男性高中入学率有所增加。由于年轻男性找到工作的前景极其黯淡，许多人决定在学校待更长时间。然而，公共教育支出急剧下降，导致许多学校人手不足, 或因缺乏资金而关闭。

Demographic trends also changed sharply. Marriages were delayed as many males waited until they could provide for a family before proposing to a prospective spouse. Divorce rates dropped steadily in the 1930s. Rates of abandonment increased as many husbands chose the "poor man's divorce" option — they just ran away from their marriages. Birth rates fell sharply, especially during the lowest points of the Depression. More and more Americans learned about birth control to avoid the added expenses of unexpected children.
人口趋势也发生了急剧变化。**婚姻被推迟，因为许多男性等到能够养家糊口才, 向未来的配偶求婚。 20 世纪 30 年代，离婚率稳步下降。**由于许多丈夫选择了“穷人离婚”的选择——他们只是逃离了婚姻，遗弃率增加了。**出生率急剧下降，尤其是在大萧条的最低点期间。**越来越多的美国人了解节育知识，*以避免意外生育带来的额外费用。* (跟现在的中国情况一样, 在学校里延后延后, 少生孩子)

Mass migrations continued throughout the 1930s. Rural New England and upstate New York lost many citizens seeking opportunity elsewhere. The GREAT PLAINS lost population to states such as California and Arizona. The Dust Bowl sent thousands of "OKIES" and "ARKIES" looking to make a better life.

=== The Great Depression


At the end of the 1920s, the United States boasted the largest economy in the world. With the destruction wrought by World War I, Europeans struggled while Americans flourished. Upon succeeding to the Presidency, Herbert Hoover predicted that the United States would soon see the day when poverty was eliminated. Then, in a moment of apparent triumph, everything fell apart. The stock market crash of 1929 touched off a chain of events that plunged the United States into its longest, deepest economic crisis of its history.


Nine thousand banks failed during the months following the stock market crash of 1929.

It is far too simplistic to view the stock market crash as the single cause of the Great Depression. A healthy economy can recover from such a contraction. Long-term underlying causes sent the nation into a downward spiral of despair. First, American firms earned record profits during the 1920s and reinvested much of these funds into expansion. By 1929, companies had expanded to the bubble point. Workers could no longer continue to fuel further expansion, so a slowdown was inevitable. While corporate profits, skyrocketed, wages increased incrementally, which widened the distribution of wealth.

The richest one percent of Americans owned over a third of all American assets. Such wealth concentrated in the hands of a few limits economic growth. The wealthy tended to save money that might have been put back into the economy if it were spread among the middle and lower classes. Middle class Americans had already stretched their debt capacities by purchasing automobiles and household appliances on installment plans.

The American way?
The unprecedented prosperity of the 1920s was suddenly gone, the Great Depression was upon the nation, and breadlines became a common sight.

There were fundamental structural weaknesses in the American economic system. Banks operated without guarantees to their customers, creating a climate of panic when times got tough. Few regulations were placed on banks and they lent money to those who speculated recklessly in stocks. Agricultural prices had already been low during the 1920s, leaving farmers unable to spark any sort of recovery. When the Depression spread across the Atlantic, Europeans bought fewer American products, worsening the slide.

When President Hoover was inaugurated, the American economy was a house of cards. Unable to provide the proper relief from hard times, his popularity decreased as more and more Americans lost their jobs. His minimalist approach to government intervention made little impact . The economy shrank with each successive year of his Presidency. As middle class Americans stood in the same soup lines previously graced only by the nation's poorest, the entire social fabric of America was forever altered.

==== The Market Crashes


It was a boom time for the STOCKHOLDER. STOCK PRICES soared to record levels. Millionaires were made overnight. Sound like the stock market of the 1990s? Try the New York Stock Exchange on the eve of the GREAT CRASH in 1929.

Although the 1920s were marked by growth in stock values, the last four years saw an explosion in the market. In 1925, the total value of the NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE was $27 billion. By September 1929, that figure skyrocketed to $87 billion. This means that the average stockholder more than tripled the value of the stock portfolio he or she was lucky enough to possess.



Fueling the rapid expansion was the risky practice of buying stock on margin. A MARGIN PURCHASE allows an investor to borrow money, typically as much as 75% of the purchase price, to buy a greater amount of stock. Stockbrokers and even banks funded the reckless SPECULATOR. Borrowers were often willing to pay 20% interest rates on loans, being dead certain that the risk would be worth the rewards. The lender was so certain that the market would rise that such transactions became commonplace, despite warnings by the Federal Reserve Board against the practice. Clearly, there had to be a limit to how high the market could reach.

Stock prices, 1921-40
On October 24, 1929, a day that came to be known as Black Thursday, investors began to sell their stocks at an alarming rate. By October 29, the Great Crash was underway, and by November 17, over $30 billion dollars had disappeared from the U.S. economy. In the chart above, the horizontal axis represents the years 1921-40, and the vertical axis represents the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


What causes stock prices to fall? Although the workings of the New York Stock Exchange can be quite complex, one simple principle governs the price of stock. When investors believe a stock is a good value they are willing to pay more for a share and its value rises. When traders believe the value of a security will fall, they cannot sell it at as high of a price. If all investors try to sell their shares at once and no one is willing to buy, the value of the market shrinks.

Wealthy investors like J.P. Morgan hoped to stop the crash by pooling their resources and buying up large amounts of stock.

On October 24, 1929, "BLACK THURSDAY," this massive sell-a-thon began. By the late afternoon, wealthy financiers like J.P. Morgan pooled their resources and began to buy stocks in the hopes of reversing the trend.

But the bottom fell out of the market on Tuesday, October 29. A record 16 million shares were exchanged for smaller and smaller values as the day progressed. For some stocks, no buyers could be found at any price. By the end of the day, panic had erupted, and the next few weeks continued the downward spiral. In a matter of ten short weeks the value of the entire market was cut in half. Suicide and despair swept the investing classes of America.

==== Sinking Deeper and Deeper: 1929-33


When the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, few Americans believed that a decade long depression was underway. After all, only 4 million Americans had money invested on Wall Street. 90% of American households owned precisely zero shares of stock. President Herbert Hoover quickly addressed the nation, professing his faith in the soundness of the American economy. But soothing words were clearly not enough to stop the shrinking of a deeply flawed national economic system.

The stock market crash had many short-term consequences. Banks that improvidently lent money to futures traders to buy stock on margin found that many of those loans would go unpaid. Consequently, a rash of BANK FAILURES swept the nation. This had a tremendous ripple effect on the economy. If a working-class family was unfortunate enough to have their savings held in trust by a failed bank — too bad for them, all their money was lost.

As Americans saw banks close and savings disappear, less money was spent on goods and services. Many consumers who had bought the new conveniences of the GOLDEN TWENTIES on the installment plan were unable to make their payments. Businesses began to lay off workers to offset new losses. Many manufacturers had overproduced and created huge inventories.

Unemployment brought even less savings and spending, and the economy slowed yet another notch. The downward spiral continued into 1933. The $87 billion 1929 New York Stock Exchange was worth a mere $15 billion in 1932. UNEMPLOYMENT rose from 1.5 million Americans in 1929 to a debilitating 12 million in 1932.

Despair swept the nation. In addition to the nationwide 25% unemployment rate, many laborers were forced to choose between wage cuts and a PINK SLIP. Most people who retained their jobs saw their incomes shrink by a third. SOUP KITCHENS and CHARITY LINES, previously unknown to the middle class, were unable to meet the growing demand for food.

Desperate for income, thousands performed odd jobs from taking in laundry to collecting and selling apples on the street. College professors in New York City drove taxicabs to make ends meet. Citizens of Washington State lit forest fires in the hopes of earning a few bucks extinguishing them. Millions of backyard gardens were cultivated to grow vegetables.



Americans prowled landfills waiting for the next load of refuse to arrive in the hopes of finding a few table scraps among the trash.

The strife was uneven across the land. Oklahoma was particularly hard hit, as a DROUGHT brought dry winds, kicking up a "DUST BOWL" that forced thousands to migrate westward. African Americans endured unemployment rates of nearly twice the white communities, as African American workers were often the last hired and the first fired. Mexican Americans in California were offered free one-way trips back to Mexico to decrease job competition in the state. The Latino population of the American Southwest sharply decreased throughout the decade, as ethnic violence increased.

As the days and weeks of the GREAT DEPRESSION turned into months and years, Americans began to organize their discontent.

==== The Bonus March


Many in America wondered if the nation would survive.

Although the United States had little history of massive social upheaval or coup attempts against the government, hunger has an ominous way of stirring those passions among any population. As bread riots and shantytowns grew in number, many began to seek alternatives to the status quo. Demonstrations in the nation's capital increased, as Americans grew increasingly weary with President Hoover's perceived inaction. The demonstration that drew the most national attention was the BONUS ARMY MARCH of 1932.

In 1924, Congress rewarded VETERANS of WORLD WAR I with certificates redeemable in 1945 for $1,000 each. By 1932, many of these former servicemen had lost their jobs and fortunes in the early days of the Depression. They asked Congress to redeem their BONUS CERTIFICATES early.


Led by WALTER WATERS of Oregon, the so-called Bonus Expeditionary Force set out for the nation's capital. Hitching rides, hopping trains, and hiking finally brought the Bonus Army, now 15,000 strong, into the capital in June 1932. Although President Hoover refused to address them, the veterans did find an audience with a congressional delegation. Soon a debate began in the Congress over whether to meet the demonstrators' demands.


As deliberation continued on Capitol Hill, the Bonus Army built a SHANTYTOWN across the Potomac River in ANACOSTIA FLATS. When the Senate rejected their demands on June 17, most of the veterans dejectedly returned home. But several thousand remained in the capital with their families. Many had nowhere else to go. The Bonus Army conducted itself with decorum and spent their vigil unarmed.



However, many believed them a threat to national security. On July 28, Washington police began to clear the demonstrators out of the capital. Two men were killed as tear gas and bayonets assailed the Bonus Marchers. Fearing rising disorder, Hoover ordered an army regiment into the city, under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur. The army, complete with infantry, cavalry, and tanks, rolled into Anacostia Flats forcing the Bonus Army to flee. MacArthur then ordered the shanty settlements burned.

Many Americans were outraged. How could the army treat veterans of the Great War with such disrespect? Hoover maintained that political agitators, anarchists, and communists dominated the mob. But facts contradict his claims. Nine out of ten Bonus Marchers were indeed veterans, and 20% were disabled. Despite the fact that the Bonus Army was the largest march on Washington up to that point in history, Hoover and MacArthur clearly overestimated the threat posed to national security. As Hoover campaigned for reelection that summer, his actions turned an already sour public opinion of him even further bottomward.

America sank deeper in Depression.

==== Hoover's Last Stand



PRESIDENT HERBERT HOOVER had the distinction of stepping into the White House at the height of one of the longest periods of growth in American history. Less than seven months after his inauguration, the worst depression in American history began.

Undoubtedly, the fault of the Great Depression was not Hoover's. But as the years of his Presidency passed and the country slipped deeper and deeper into its quagmire, he would receive great blame. Urban shantytowns were dubbed HOOVERVILLES. Newspapers used by the destitute as bundling for warmth became known as Hoover blankets. Pockets turned inside out were called Hoover flags. Somebody had to be blamed, and many Americans blamed their President.

Running for President under the slogan "RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM" made it difficult for Hoover to promote massive government intervention in the economy. In 1930, succumbing to pressure from American industrialists, Hoover signed the HAWLEY-SMOOT TARIFF which was designed to protect American industry from overseas competition. Passed against the advice of nearly every prominent economist of the time, it was the largest TARIFF in American history.




The amount of protection received by industry did not offset the losses brought by a decrease in foreign trade. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff proved to be a disaster. Believing in a balanced budget, Hoover's 1931 economic plan cut federal spending and increased taxes, both of which inhibited individual efforts to spur the economy.



Finally in 1932 Hoover signed legislation creating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. This act allocated a half billion dollars for loans to banks, corporations, and state governments. Public works projects such as the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE and the Los Angeles Aqueduct were built as a result of this plan.



Hoover and the RFC stopped short of meeting one demand of the American masses — federal aid to individuals. Hoover believed that government aid would stifle initiative and create dependency where individual effort was needed. Past governments never resorted to such schemes and the economy managed to rebound. Clearly Hoover and his advisors failed to grasp the scope of the Great Depression.



The stage was set for the ELECTION OF 1932. New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt won the Democratic nomination on the fourth ballot of their national convention. Roosevelt promised "a new deal for the American people" that included a repeal of the prohibition amendment. The Republicans renominated Hoover, perhaps because there were few other interested GOP candidates.

Election day brought a landslide for the Democrats, as Roosevelt earned 58% of the popular vote and 89% of the electoral vote, handing the Republicans their second-worst defeat in their history. Bands across America struck up Roosevelt's theme song — "HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN" — as millions of Americans looked with hope toward their new leader.

==== Social and Cultural Effects of the Depression


No nation could emerge from the cauldron of national crisis without profound social and cultural changes. While many undesirable vices associated with hopelessness were on the rise, many family units were also strengthened through the crisis. MASS MIGRATIONS reshaped the American mosaic. While many businesses perished during the Great Depression, others actually emerged stronger. And new forms of expression flourished in the culture of despair.

The Great Depression brought a rapid rise in the CRIME RATE as many unemployed workers resorted to petty theft to put food on the table. Suicide rates rose, as did reported cases of malnutrition. Prostitution was on the rise as desperate women sought ways to pay the bills. Health care in general was not a priority for many Americans, as visiting the doctor was reserved for only the direst of circumstances. Alcoholism increased with Americans seeking outlets for escape, compounded by the repeal of prohibition in 1933. Cigar smoking became too expensive, so many Americans switched to cheaper cigarettes.

Higher education remained out of reach for most Americans as the nation's universities saw their student bodies shrink during the first half of the decade. High school attendance increased among males, however. Because the prospects of a young male getting a job were so incredibly dim, many decided to stay in school longer. However, public spending on education declined sharply, causing many schools to open understaffed or close due to lack of funds.

Demographic trends also changed sharply. Marriages were delayed as many males waited until they could provide for a family before proposing to a prospective spouse. Divorce rates dropped steadily in the 1930s. Rates of abandonment increased as many husbands chose the "poor man's divorce" option — they just ran away from their marriages. Birth rates fell sharply, especially during the lowest points of the Depression. More and more Americans learned about birth control to avoid the added expenses of unexpected children.

Mass migrations continued throughout the 1930s. Rural New England and upstate New York lost many citizens seeking opportunity elsewhere. The GREAT PLAINS lost population to states such as California and Arizona. The Dust Bowl sent thousands of "OKIES" and "ARKIES" looking to make a better life. Many of the MIGRANTS were adolescents seeking opportunity away from a family that had younger mouths to feed. Over 600,000 people were caught hitching rides on trains during the Great Depression. Many times offenders went unpunished.


President Roosevelt made wide use of radio technology with his periodic "fireside chats" to keep the public informed.

And an apt musical form — the blues — gained popularity during the decade.
