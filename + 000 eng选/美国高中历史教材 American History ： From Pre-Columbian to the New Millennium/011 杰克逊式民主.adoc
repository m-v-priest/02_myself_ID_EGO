== 投票权的扩大

Leaders in the earlier system remained deeply suspicious that parties could corrupt and destroy the young republic.
早期体制的领导人仍然深感怀疑，认为政党可能会腐败并摧毁这个年轻的共和国。

Immediately after the Revolution most states retained some PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS that prevented poor people from voting. Following republican logic, citizens were believed to need an economic stake in society in order to be trusted to vote wisely. If a voter lacked economic independence, then it seemed that those who controlled his livelihood could easily manipulate his vote.
革命结束后，大多数州立即保留了一些阻止穷人投票的财产要求。*按照共和逻辑，人们认为, 公民需要在社会中拥有经济利益，才能被信任他们能够进行明智的投票。如果一个选民缺乏经济独立，那么那些控制他生计的人, 似乎就可以轻易操纵他的选票(即购买他们的选票)。*

Ironically, just as industrial wage labor began to create dependent laborers on a large new scale, the older republican commitment to propertied voters fell out of favor. As property requirements for voting were abolished, economic status disappeared as a foundation for citizenship. By 1840 more than 90 percent of adult white men possessed the right to vote.
具有讽刺意味的是，正当工业工资劳动开始大规模地创造出依赖劳动者时，共和党对有产选民的旧承诺却失宠了。**随着投票的财产要求被废除，经济地位作为公民身份的基础消失了。**到 1840 年，超过 90% 的成年白人拥有投票权。

Not only that, voters could now cast their opinion for more offices. Previously, governors and presidential electors had usually been selected by state legislatures as part of a republican strategy that limited the threat of direct democratic control over the highest political offices. The growing democratic temper of the first decades of the 19th century changed this and increasingly all offices were chosen by direct vote. The United States was the world leader in allowing popular participation in elections. This triumph of American politics built upon, but also expanded, the egalitarian ideals of the American Revolution.
不仅如此，选民现在还可以为更多的职位表达意见。**此前，"州长"和"总统选举人", 通常由州"立法机构"选出，**作为共和党战略的一部分，限制直接民主控制最高政治职位的威胁。 **19 世纪头几十年日益增长的民主气氛改变了这一点，所有职位都越来越多地通过直接投票选出。**美国在允许民众参与选举方面处于世界领先地位。美国政治的这一胜利建立在美国革命的平等主义理想之上，但也扩展了这一理想。

This democratic triumph, however, also had sharp limitations that today seem quite shocking. At the same time that state legislatures opened SUFFRAGE (that is, the right to vote) to all white men, they simultaneously closed the door firmly on white women and free African Americans. This movement was especially disappointing since it represented a retreat from a broader sense of political rights that had been included in some early state constitutions.
然而，这一民主胜利也有严重的局限性，今天看来相当令人震惊。在州立法机构向所有白人男性开放选举权（即投票权）的同时，他们同时牢牢地向白人女性和自由的非裔美国人关上了大门。这场运动尤其令人失望，因为它代表了一些早期州宪法所包含的更广泛的政治权利意识的倒退。


For example, New Jersey revised its state constitution to abolish property requirements in 1807, but at the same time prevented all women from voting (even wealthy ones who had been allowed to vote there since 1776) as well as all free blacks.
例如，新泽西州于 1807 年修改了州宪法，废除了财产要求，但同时禁止所有妇女（甚至是自 1776 年以来被允许投票的富有妇女）以及所有自由黑人投票。

== 杰克逊式民主 -- 人民高于精英

Van Buren, perhaps even more than Jackson, helped to create the new Democratic party that centered upon three chief qualities closely linked to Jacksonian Democracy. First, it declared itself to be the party of ordinary farmers and workers. Second, it opposed the special privileges of economic elites. Third, to offer affordable western land to ordinary white Americans, Indians needed to be forced further westward. The WHIG PARTY soon arose to challenge the Democrats with a different policy platform and vision for the nation. Whigs' favored active government support for economic improvement as the best route to sustained prosperity. Thus, the Whig-Democrat political contest was in large part a disagreement about the early Industrial Revolution. Whigs defended economic development's broad benefits, while Democrats stressed the new forms of dependence that it created. The fiercely partisan campaigns waged between these parties lasted into the 1850s and are known as the SECOND PARTY SYSTEM, an assuredly modern framework of political competition that reached ordinary voters as never before with both sides organizing tirelessly to carry their message directly to the American people.

范布伦，甚至可能比杰克逊，更加大力帮助创建了新的**"民主党"，它以三个主要品质为中心，**与杰克逊式民主密切相关。**首先，它宣称自己是普通农民和工人的政党。其次，它反对经济精英的特权。第三，为了向普通美国白人提供负担得起的西部土地，印第安人需要被迫进一步向西迁移。** +
**"辉格党"很快崛起，以不同的政策纲领和国家愿景挑战"民主党"。辉格党支持"政府积极支持经济改善的行动"，**认为这是实现持续繁荣的最佳途径。因此，"辉格党"和"民主党"的政治竞争, 在很大程度上是对"早期工业革命"的分歧。"辉格党"为"经济发展能带来广泛利益"进行辩护，而"民主党"则强调"经济发展带来的新形式的依赖"。 +
**两党之间激烈的党派斗争, 一直持续到19世纪50年代，被称为"第二党体系"，这是一种毫无疑问的"现代政治竞争框架"，前所未有地影响到普通选民，双方都不知疲倦地组织起来，直接向美国人民传达自己的信息。**

.辉格党 Whig Party
是美国一个已消失的政党，在1833年-1856年间(共23年)持续运作, 反对安德鲁·杰克逊总统(民主党)及其创建之"民主党"所订立的政策。具体的说，**辉格党拥护"国会立法权"高于"总统内阁的执行权"，**赞同现代化与经济发展纲领。 +
该党自选“辉格”为名，主要是附和反对英国王室君主专权的辉格党，以象征反对"总统专权独断"。

19 世紀中葉以前，美國兩大主要政黨就是"民主黨"與"輝格黨"。

由不同利益團體組成的輝格黨，可視為一個鬆散的政治聯盟. 因摒弃组织紧密的民主党式惯性"政党效忠"，辉格党始终受派系之争所苦。

1854 年，「堪薩斯-內布拉斯加法案」（Kansas-Nebraska Act）通過，授權聯邦新領土及州份, 可自行決定是否允許奴隸制。法案令"奴隸制問題"再次浮面。*包括林肯在內的"反奴隸制輝格黨人"認為，自己的黨派未能阻止奴隸制擴展，決定脫黨，並與其他同樣反對奴隸制的民主黨人，組成了今天的"共和黨。"*

.民主党  Democratic Party
*1828年, 第七任美国总统"安德鲁·杰克逊"创建"民主党".* 但它的起源最早可以追溯至"托马斯·杰斐逊"于1792年创立的"民主共和党"。

**"民主党"在建立之初, 主要代表美国南部和中西部"农场主"的利益，主张民粹主义的农业主义。**因此:

- 民主党在19世纪中期通过法案, 强制驱逐印第安人，发动美墨战争，获得大量土地以供农耕。
- **在美国内战中则支持"奴隶制", 以维护成型的农业体制。** "民主党"在战后长期获得南方各州的支持。
- *20世纪初，民主党加入支持维护白人的工人权利*，创建了联邦储备系统，并通过了反垄断法，*限制大企业的垄断。*
- 自从1930年代以来，富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福总统, 推行"新政", 并称之为**美国的"自由主义"(即反对削减社会安全网，支持政府在减少贫富差距、提供教育、保障医保、监管经济活动, 和保护自然环境方面采取行动)**，此后**强调"社会保障体系"就成为了民主党的主要政策。**

**民主党在2000年代之前的政策, 一直偏向于白人、蓝领、工人阶级和农民的利益；但在2000年后发生了巨大转变，**因为支持者主要是东西岸及五大湖地区的大都会居民，**所以现在的"民主党"主要获大企业、城市富裕阶层、女性、LGBT、代表性不足少数族裔（非、拉、原住民）的支持，对内力求建立平等型的福利国家，**对外奉行国际主义的外交政策。

A new era of American politics began with Jackson's election in 1828, but it also completed a grand social experiment begun by the American Revolution. Although the Founding Fathers would have been astounded by the new shape of the nation during Jackson's presidency, just as Jackson himself had served in the American Revolution, its values helped form his sense of the world. The ideals of the Revolution had, of course, been altered by the new conditions of the early nineteenth century and would continue to be reworked over time. Economic, religious, and geographic changes had all reshaped the nation in fundamental ways and pointed toward still greater opportunities and pitfalls in the future. Nevertheless, JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY represented a provocative blending of the best and worst qualities of American society. On the one hand it was an authentic democratic movement that contained a principled egalitarian thrust, but this powerful social critique was always cast for the benefit of white men. This tragic mix of egalitarianism, masculine privilege, and racial prejudice remains a central quality of American life and to explore their relationship in the past may help suggest ways of overcoming their haunting limitations in the future.
**1828年杰克逊的当选, 开启了美国政治的新纪元，同时也完成了美国革命开始的一项宏大的社会实验。**尽管开国元勋们, 会对杰克逊担任总统期间国家的新形态感到震惊，就像杰克逊本人在美国革命中服役一样，但它的价值观, 帮助形成了他的世界观。当然，**革命的理想, 已经被十九世纪初的新形势所改变，并且随着时间的推移将继续被修改。经济、宗教和地理的变化, 都从根本上重塑了这个国家，并为未来带来了更大的机遇和陷阱。**然而，杰克逊式民主, 代表了美国社会最好和最坏品质的挑衅性融合。一方面，这是一场真正的民主运动，包含有原则的平等主义主旨，但这种强有力的社会批评, 总是为了白人的利益。这种平等主义、男性特权, 和种族偏见的悲剧性混合体, 仍然是美国生活的核心品质，探索它们过去的关系, 可能有助于提出"克服它们在未来难以摆脱的局限性"的方法。

.Andrew Jackson 杰克逊民主 (1829-1837年, 第七任美国总统)
*"杰克逊民主"因杰克逊得名，代表民主的转变与扩张，即精英阶层的部分政治权力, 转移到以"政党"为基础的普通选民手中。美国政治和国民议程, 在“杰克逊时代”发生重大变化。*

image:/img/Andrew Jackson.jpg[,30%]


**杰克逊的总统哲学, 与杰斐逊类似，倡导革命一代持有的"共和"价值观。杰克逊的道德立场倾向靠平均地权、限制联邦政府权力、强调州权, 来减少腐败，担心金钱与商业利益会损害共和价值观。**南卡罗来纳州在反对"关税法",威胁"分家单过"之际，*他极力主张国家至上、反对分裂。*

- 杰克逊相信人民能够“得出正确结论”, 他们有权选举并“指示代表和代理人”. 公职人员要么服从民意、要么辞职。
- 他主张“国会、行政、法院, 应当各自遵从对应宪法条文，以自身理解主导”，不应将决定权交给所谓强大而独立的最高法院。
- 杰克逊认为"最高法院大法官"应由选举生产，保障民主统治的最好办法是"从严解读宪法"。
- 他呼吁限制总统任期、废除选举人团。

《美国简史》的作者雷 Robert V. Remini 认为, 杰克逊的政治哲学“远超时代，甚至可能超越本国能力极限”。

杰克逊式民主（英语：Jacksonian democracy），又译"杰弗逊式民主"，是19世纪美国的一种意识形态、政治现象或者说是一种政治运动，鼓吹大众民主. 美国总统"安德鲁·杰克逊"是其核心人物，一度风靡美国。 +
杰克逊及其拥趸, 形成了一个由唯农论者、平民主义者、自由主义者、民族主义者等群体, 出于政治上的考量而组成的联盟。 +
总之，*杰克逊式民主, 使得美国政治大众化，给后世带来的影响是: 民主从启蒙时代的菁英掌控, 转向了平民（当时指的是中产阶级白人男性）广泛参政。*

杰克逊时代，这种民主思潮, 约始于1828年杰克逊获选总统；直至1858年后美国奴隶制度问题趋向炽热，以及美国政治因为南北战争而转为"第三政党制"，象征该时代结束。

*1820年代，杰佛逊派别将"民主共和党"派别化的同时，杰克逊的支持者亦开始组织现代的"民主党"；同时也有以约翰·昆西·亚当斯及杰克逊派别为竞敌的派别，之后合为"辉格党"。*

更为广义，杰克逊民主亦可定义为第二政党制（1830年代中叶－1854年）的时代，这时代以民主精神见称。

杰克逊之后的时代下，美国的投票门槛开始降低，民主进入平民草根时代，几乎所有成年男性公民都获选举权。*在杰克逊之前，美国历届总统均出身东部拥有相当政治权力的保守的贵族精英；但此后平民、乡下地区出身的人, 开始参与政治*。

杰克逊的所作所为为美国社会统治与管理带来了革命性变化，迄今为止，总共有两位总统有此贡献：一位是19世纪的杰克逊，另一位是21世纪的罗斯福总统。随着杰克逊执掌政权，发生了深刻而持久的政治变革：其一，政治权力核心由东部转移到西部；其二，组织严密的政党发挥着越来越重要的作用；其三，政治机器——奥尔巴尼摄政团——越发成熟；其四，民主政治越来越普及。

On July 4, 1826, less than two years before "KING ANDREW" ascended to the "throne," the Yankee JOHN ADAMS and the aristocratic Virginian THOMAS JEFFERSON both passed away. America's Revolutionary generation was gone. With them went the last vestiges of the FEDERALIST and DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN parties. This helped to bring about a new balance of political power, and with it two new political parties. The 1828 election was portrayed by Jackson's Democrats as proof of the "common people's right" to pick a President. No longer were Virginia Presidents and northern money-men calling the shots. Class systems were breaking down. To that end, some states had recently abolished property requirements for voting. These poorer folk supported General Jackson.
**1826年7月4日，距离“安德鲁国王”登上“王位”不到两年，北方佬约翰·亚当斯, 和弗吉尼亚贵族托马斯·杰斐逊, 双双去世。美国的革命一代已经消失了。"联邦党"和"民主共和党"的最后残余, 也随之消失。这有助于实现政治权力的新平衡，并带来两个新的政党。**杰克逊的"民主党人"将 1828 年的选举, 描述为“普通人民有权”选择"总统"的证据。弗吉尼亚总统和北方财主, 不再发号施令。阶级制度正在崩溃。为此，一些州最近取消了投票的财产要求。这些较穷的人支持杰克逊将军。

Jackson's strong personality and controversial ways incited the development of an opposition party, the WHIGS. Their name echoes British history. In Great Britain, the Whigs were the party opposed to a strong monarch. By calling themselves Whigs, Jackson's enemies labeled him a king. And they held firm in their opposition to "King Andrew" and his hated policies.
杰克逊坚强的个性, 和颇具争议的行事方式, 促进了"反对党辉格党"的发展。后者的名字呼应了英国的历史。**在英国，辉格党是反对强势君主的政党。**杰克逊的敌人称自己为辉格党，并称他(之杰克逊)为"国王"。他们坚决反对“安德鲁国王”和他令人憎恶的政策。

Sectional rivalries bubbled to the surface as the ERA OF GOOD FEELINGS slipped into history. The South began feeling more and more resentful of the influential manufacturers of the North. The South's resentment came to an ugly head in the nullification battle of the early 1830s in which South Carolina considered leaving the Union because it disagreed with a federal law. The Second Bank of the United States was seen by westerners and southerners as a tool to make northerners and easterners rich at the expense of the rest of the country. Through force of personality, Jackson got his way in the nullification battle and triumphed again when he vetoed the charter of the national bank. These regional rifts would only get worse over time.
随着“美好感情时代”逐渐成为历史，部门间的竞争浮出水面。南方开始对"北方有影响力的那些制造商"越来越不满。在 1830 年代初期的废奴之战中，南方的怨恨达到了丑陋的地步，当时"南卡罗来纳州"因为不同意一项联邦法律, 而考虑离开联邦。美国第二银行, 被西方人和南方人视为让北方人和东方人致富的工具，而牺牲了该国其他地区的利益。凭借个人的力量，杰克逊在废除国家银行章程的斗争中, 取得了胜利，并在否决了国家银行章程时, 再次取得了胜利。但随着时间的推移，这些地区分歧, 只会变得更加严重。


The Jacksonian Era was nothing short of another American Revolution. By 1850, the "common man" demanded his place in politics, the office of the president was invigorated, and the frontier exerted its ever more powerful impact on the American scene. Hated by many, but loved by many more, Andrew Jackson embodied this new American character.
杰克逊时代无异于另一场美国革命。到了 1850 年，“普通人”要求在政治上占有一席之地，总统办公室充满活力，边疆对美国舞台产生了越来越强大的影响。安德鲁·杰克逊被许多人憎恨，但也受到更多人的喜爱，他体现了这种新的美国性格。

Growth, expansion and social change rapidly followed the end of the WAR OF 1812. Many an enterprising American pushed westward. In the new western states, there was a greater level of equality among the masses than in the former English colonies. Land was readily available. Frontier life required hard work. There was little tolerance for aristocrats afraid to get their hands dirty.
1812 年战争结束后，经济增长、扩张和社会变革迅速展开。许多有进取心的美国人向西推进。**在新的西部各州，群众之间的平等程度比前英国殖民地更高。**土地很容易获得。边疆生活需要艰苦奋斗。对于害怕弄脏自己的手的贵族来说，几乎没有容忍度。

The west led the path by having no property requirements for voting, which the eastern states soon adopted, as well.
**西部各州走在了前面，投票时没有财产要求，东部各州也很快采用了这一做法。**

The COMMON MAN always held a special place in America, but with Jackson, he rose to the top of the American political power system.
*普通人在美国一直占有特殊的地位，但在杰克逊的带领下，他登上了美国政治权力体系的顶端。*

In the campaign of 1828, Jackson, known as "OLD HICKORY," triumphed over the aristocratic, reclusive and unpopular incumbent PRESIDENT JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.
在 1828 年的竞选中，被称为“老胡桃木”的杰克逊, 击败了贵族出身、隐居且不受欢迎的现任总统"约翰·昆西·亚当斯"。

The first six Presidents were from the same mold: wealthy, educated, and from the east. Jackson was a self-made man who declared education an unnecessary requirement for political leadership. Indeed, Jackson launched the era when politicians would desperately try to show how poor they had been.
美国开国后, 前六位总统都是同一模子：富有、受过教育、来自东方。杰克逊是一个白手起家的人，他宣称教育对于政治领导来说是不必要的要求。事实上，杰克逊开创了一个政客们拼命试图展示他们有多么贫穷的时代。

Jackson's inauguration in 1828 seemed to many the embodiment of "MOB RULE" by uneducated ruffians. Jackson rode to the White House followed by a swarm of well-wishers who were invited in. Muddy hob-nailed boots trod over new carpets, glassware and crockery were smashed, and chaos generally reigned. After a time, Jackson ordered the punch bowls moved outside to the White House lawn, and the crowd followed. Naturally, Jackson's critics were quick to point to the party as the beginning of the "reign of King Mob."
在许多人看来，杰克逊 1828 年的就职典礼, 似乎是未受过教育的暴徒实施“暴民统治”的体现。杰克逊骑马前往白宫，后面跟着一大群受邀的祝福者。沾满泥巴的平头钉靴子踩在新地毯上，玻璃器皿和陶器被砸碎，一片混乱。过了一段时间，杰克逊下令将潘趣酒碗移到白宫草坪上，人群也跟着移动。自然，杰克逊的批评者很快指出这次聚会是“黑帮之王统治”的开始。


As a military hero, a frontiersman, and a POPULIST, Jackson enchanted the common people and alarmed the political, social and economic elite. A Man of the People would now govern the nation — America did not disintegrate into anarchy.
作为一名军事英雄、一名拓荒者, 和一名民粹主义者，杰克逊让普通民众着迷，也让政治、社会和经济精英感到震惊。现在将由一个人民来统治国家——美国并没有陷入无政府状态。


Jackson was committed to remaining a MAN OF THE PEOPLE, representing and protecting the Common Man. He possessed a commanding presence, a strong will, and a personality that reflected his strength and decisiveness. Jackson had a lot going for him in the view of the electorate. In the War of 1812, he defeated the British at NEW ORLEANS IN 1815. He was renowned as an Indian fighter. Jackson's military service had produced a large and influential group of supporters and friends who urged him to seek the Presidency.
杰克逊致力于继续成为人民的代表，代表并保护普通人。他具有威严的气势、坚强的意志, 和体现出他的力量和果断的个性。在选民看来，杰克逊有很多优点。在 1812 年战争中，他于 1815 年在"新奥尔良"击败了英国人。他作为"抗击印第安者"而闻名(印第安人和英军是同盟)。杰克逊的参军经历, 造就了一大批有影响力的支持者和朋友，他们敦促他竞选总统。

Major General Andrew Jackson made a name for himself at the Battle of New Orleans. He was the only U.S. President to be a veteran of both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.
安德鲁·杰克逊少将, 在"新奥尔良战役"中一举成名。他是唯一一位同时参加过"独立战争"和 "1812 年战争"的美国总统。

The Founders of the nation feared a tyrannical President — they believed that only a strong Congress could best represent the people. Jackson felt that the Congress was not representing the people — that they were acting like an aristocracy. Jackson took the view that only the President could be trusted to stand for the will of the people against the aristocratic Congress. Jackson's weapon was the veto. "ANDY VETO" used this power more often than all six previous Presidents combined.
**建国之父们害怕会有一位残暴的总统——他们相信, 只有强大的"国会", 才能最好地代表人民。但杰克逊则认为"国会"并不代表人民——他们的行为就像贵族一样。杰克逊认为，只有"总统"才能代表人民的意志, 来反对贵族国会。**杰克逊的武器就是"否决权"。 “安迪否决权”使用这一权力的次数, 比前六任总统的总和还多。

At the same time, Jackson espoused the "SPOILS SYSTEM" in awarding government offices. In his view, far too many career politicians walked the streets of Washington. These people had lost touch with the public. Jackson believed in rotation in office. America was best served with clearing out the old officeholders and replacing them with appointees of the winning candidates. This "spoils system" would eventually lead to considerable CORRUPTION. To Jackson, rotating the officeholders was simply more democratic.
与此同时，杰克逊在授予政府职位时, 拥护“战利品制度”。在他看来，华盛顿街头行走的职业政客太多了。这些人已经与民众失去了联系。杰克逊相信, 政府办公室里的官员应执行"轮换制"。对美国最有利的做法就是清除旧的官员，用对"获胜的候选人"的任命, 来代替他们。这种“分赃制度”最终会导致严重的腐败。对杰克逊来说，轮换制更加民主。

While he made his share of enemies, Jackson transformed the Office of the President into one of dynamic leadership and initiative. His direct appeal to the people for support was new and has served as a model for strong Presidents to this day.
杰克逊虽然树敌众多，但他把总统办公室, 也变成了一个充满"活力"和"工作主动性"的办公室。他对"支持人民"的直接呼吁, 是新颖的，至今仍是"强有力总统"的效仿榜样。

== 南卡罗来纳州"拒绝接受联邦法律"的争议 The South Carolina Nullification Controversy

By the late 1820's, the north was becoming increasingly industrialized, and the south was remaining predominately agricultural.
到 1820 年代末，北方工业化程度不断提高，而南方仍以农业为主。

In 1828, Congress passed a high protective tariff that infuriated the southern states because they felt it only benefited the industrialized north. For example, a high TARIFF on imports increased the cost of British TEXTILES. This tariff benefited American producers of cloth — mostly in the north. But it shrunk English demand for southern raw cotton and increased the final cost of finished goods to American buyers. The southerners looked to Vice President John C. Calhoun from South Carolina for leadership against what they labeled the "TARIFF OF ABOMINATIONS."
1828年，国会通过了一项高额"保护性关税"，这激怒了南方各州，因为他们认为, 这只会让"工业化的北方"受益。例如，"高进口关税"增加了从英国进口的纺织品的成本。这项关税使美国的"布料生产商"受益——主要是在北方(即, 对美国人来说, 英国进口货更贵了, 美国本国货相对更便宜了)。但这减少了英国对"美国南方的原棉"的需求，并增加了美国买家的"成品最终成本"(应为美国对英国的进口产品, 增加了关税, 抬高了在美国的售价)。南方人指望来自"南卡罗来纳州"的副总统"约翰·C·卡尔霍恩"（John C. Calhoun）发挥领导作用，反对他们所谓的“令人憎恶的关税”。


The Ordinance of Nullification issued by South Carolina in 1832 foreshadowed the state's announcement of secession nearly 30 years later.
**南卡罗来纳州于 1832 年颁布的《废除法令》, 预示着该州在美国开国近 30 年后, 宣布脱离联邦。**

Calhoun had supported the Tariff of 1816, but he realized that if he were to have a political future in South Carolina, he would need to rethink his position. Some felt that this issue was reason enough for dissolution of the Union. Calhoun argued for a less drastic solution — the doctrine of "NULLIFICATION." According to Calhoun, the federal government only existed at the will of the states. Therefore, if a state found a federal law unconstitutional and detrimental to its sovereign interests, it would have the right to "nullify" that law within its borders. Calhoun advanced the position that a state could declare a national law void.
卡尔霍恩曾支持 1816 年的关税，但他意识到，如果他想在"南卡罗来纳州"拥有政治前途，他需要重新考虑自己的立场。**一些人认为, 这个问题足以成为"脱离联盟"的理由。卡尔霍恩主张采取一种不那么激烈的解决方案——“无效化”说。卡尔霍恩认为，"联邦政府"仅根据"各州"的意愿而存在。因此，如果一个州发现一项"联邦法律"违宪, 并损害其(州的)主权利益，它就有权在其境内“废除”该法律。卡尔霍恩提出了一个立场，即"州可以宣布国家法律无效"。**


In 1832, Henry Clay pushed through Congress a new tariff bill, with lower rates than the Tariff of Abominations, but still too high for the southerners. A majority of states-rights proponents had won the South Carolina State House in the recent 1832 election and their reaction was swift. The SOUTH CAROLINA ORDINANCE OF NULLIFICATION was enacted into law on November 24, 1832. As far as South Carolina was concerned, there was no tariff. A line had been drawn. Would President Jackson dare to cross it?
1832 年，亨利·克莱 (Henry Clay) 推动国会, 通过了一项新的关税法案，其税率低于《令人憎恶的关税》(Tariff of Abominations)，但对南方人来说仍然太高。大多数"州权"支持者, 在最近的 1832 年选举中赢得了南卡罗来纳州"众议院"的席位，他们的反应很快。 《南卡罗来纳州废止条例》于 1832 年 11 月 24 日颁布成为"州法律"。就南卡罗来纳州而言，不接受关税。我们这一条红线已经画好了, 你杰克逊总统敢跨越过它吗？

Jackson rightly regarded this STATES-RIGHTS challenge as so serious that he asked Congress to enact legislation permitting him to use federal troops to enforce federal laws in the face of nullification. Fortunately, an armed confrontation was avoided when Congress, led by the efforts of Henry Clay, revised the tariff with a compromise bill. This permitted the South Carolinians to back down without "losing face."
杰克逊正确地认为, 这一对"国家权力"的挑战非常严重，以至于他要求"国会"颁布立法，允许他在面临"州在拒绝联邦法律"的情况下, 使用"联邦军队"来执行"联邦法律"。幸运的是，在亨利·克莱的努力下，国会通过妥协法案, 修改了关税，避免了武装对抗。这使得南卡罗来纳人能够在“不丢面子”的情况下做出让步。

In retrospect, Jackson's strong, decisive support for the Union was one of the great moments of his Presidency. If nullification had been successful, could secession have been far behind?
*回想起来，杰克逊对联邦的强有力、决定性的支持, 是他总统任期内最伟大的时刻之一。如果"州对联邦法律的拒绝"成功了，联邦的分裂还会远吗？*

== 美国工业的崛起 The Rise of American Industry

During the first 30 years of the 1800s, AMERICAN INDUSTRY was truly born.
在 1800 年代的头 30 年里，美国工业真正诞生了。

In 1790, SAMUEL SLATER built the first factory in America, based on the secrets of textile manufacturing he brought from England.
**1790 年，塞缪尔·斯莱特 (Samuel SLATER) 根据他从英国带来的纺织制造秘密，在美国建造了第一家工厂。**

Ever since the days of Jamestown and Plymouth, America was moving West. TRAIL BLAZERS had first hewn their way on foot and by horseback. HOMESTEADERS followed by WAGON and by either keelboat or bargeboat, bringing their possessions with them. Yet, real growth in the movement of people and goods west started with the canal.
自从"詹姆斯敦"和"普利茅斯"时代以来，美国就一直向西移动。开拓者队首先是步行和骑马开辟道路。宅基地后面跟着货车和龙骨船或驳船，带着他们的财产。然而，人员和货物向西流动的真正增长, 始于"运河"。

For over a hundred years, people had dreamed of building a canal across New York that would connect the Great Lakes to the Hudson River to New York City and the Atlantic Ocean. After unsuccessfully seeking federal government assistance, DEWITT CLINTON successfully petitioned the New York State legislature to build the canal and bring that dream to reality.
**一百多年来，人们一直梦想着修建一条横跨纽约的运河，将五大湖、哈德逊河、纽约市, 和大西洋连接起来。** 在寻求"联邦政府"援助未果后，德威特·克林顿, 成功向"纽约州立法机构"请愿修建运河，将这一梦想变为现实。


Construction began in 1817 and was completed in 1825. The canal spanned 350 miles between the Great Lakes and the Hudson River and was an immediate success. Between its completion and its closure in 1882, it returned over $121 million in revenues on an original cost of $7 million. Its success led to the great CANAL AGE. By bringing the Great Lakes within reach of a metropolitan market, the ERIE CANAL opened up the unsettled northern regions of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. It also fostered the development of many small industrial companies, whose products were used in the construction and operation of the canal.
这条运河于 1817 年动工，于 1825 年竣工。这条运河横跨五大湖和哈德逊河，全长 350 英里，立即取得了成功。从竣工到 1882 年关闭，该公司以 700 万美元的原始成本获得了超过 1.21 亿美元的收入。它的成功导致了伟大的"运河时代"。"伊利运河"使五大湖区靠近大都市市场，从而开辟了俄亥俄州、印第安纳州和伊利诺伊州北部不稳定的地区。它还促进了许多小型工业公司的发展，这些公司的产品被用于运河的建设和运营。

New York City became the principal gateway to the West and financial center for the nation. The Erie Canal was also in part responsible for the creation of strong bonds between the new western territories and the northern states. Soon the flat lands of the west would be converted into large-scale grain farming. The Canal enabled the farmers to send their goods to New England. Subsistence farmers in the north were now less necessary. Many farmers left for jobs in the factories. The Erie Canal transformed America.
**纽约市成为通往西方的主要门户和国家的金融中心。** +
**伊利运河, 也对在"新的西部领土"和"北部各州"之间建立牢固的联系, 承担起了部分责任。**很快，西部的平坦土地, 就会变成大规模的粮食种植。**运河使农民能够将货物运往"新英格兰"。**北方自给自足的农民, 现在也不再需要那么多了, 许多农民可以离开本地, 去工厂工作。伊利运河改变了美国。



Pennsylvanians were shocked to find that the cheapest route to Pittsburgh was by way of New York City, up the Hudson River, across New York by the Erie Canal to the Great Lakes — with a short overland trip to Pittsburgh. When it became evident that little help for state improvements could be expected from the federal government, other states followed New York in constructing canals. Ohio built a canal in 1834 to link the Great Lakes with the Mississippi Valley. As a result of Ohio's investment, Cleveland rose from a frontier village to a Great Lakes port by 1850. Cincinnati could now send food products down the Ohio and Mississippi by flatboat and steamboat and ship flour by canal boat to New York.
宾夕法尼亚州人惊讶地发现，前往"匹兹堡"最便宜的路线, 是取道纽约市，沿"哈德逊河"而上，经"伊利运河"穿过"纽约"到达"五大湖"，然后通过短途陆路, 到达"匹兹堡"。 +
当联邦政府显然无法对各州的"基建"改善, 提供帮助时，**其他州纷纷效仿纽约修建运河。** +
**俄亥俄州于 1834 年修建了一条运河，将"五大湖"与"密西西比河谷"连接起来。**由于俄亥俄州的投资，到 1850 年，"**克利夫兰"从一个边境村庄, 发展成为"五大湖港口"。** "辛辛那提"现在可以通过平底船和汽船, 将食品沿着俄亥俄州和密西西比河运送，并通过运河船, 将面粉运送到纽约。

The state of Pennsylvania then put through a great portage canal system to Pittsburgh. It used a series of inclined planes and stationary steam engines to transport canal boats up and over the Alleghenies on rails. At its peak, Pennsylvania had almost a thousand miles of canals in operation. By the 1830s, the country had a complete water route from New York City to New Orleans. By 1840, over 3,000 miles of canals had been built. Yet, within twenty years a new mode of transportation, the railroad, would render most of them unprofitable.
宾夕法尼亚州, 随后开通了通往"匹兹堡"的大型运输运河系统。它采用了一系列的倾斜平台和固定蒸汽引擎，通过轨道运输"运河船只", 来越过阿勒格尼山脉。在鼎盛时期，宾夕法尼亚州有近一千英里的运河在运营。到 1830 年代，该国已拥有从纽约市到新奥尔良的完整水路。到 1840 年，运河已建成 3,000 多英里。然而，在二十年内，一种新的运输方式——铁路——将使大多数运河无利可图。

The development of RAILROADS was one of the most important phenomena of the Industrial Revolution. With their formation, construction and operation, they brought profound social, economic and political change to a country only 50 years old.
铁路的发展是"工业革命"最重要的现象之一。它们的形成、建设和运作，给这个只有50年历史的国家, 带来了深刻的社会、经济和政治变革。

Baltimore, the third largest city in the nation in 1827, had not invested in a canal. Yet, Baltimore was 200 miles closer to the frontier than New York and soon recognized that the development of a railway could make the city more competitive with New York and the Erie Canal in transporting people and goods to the West. The result was the BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD, the first railroad chartered in the United States.
巴尔的摩是 1827 年的美国第三大城市，当时还没有投资修建运河。然而，巴尔的摩比纽约距离边境近 200 英里，很快就认识到, 铁路的发展可以使该市, 在向西部运送"人员和货物"方面, 比纽约和伊利运河更具竞争力。结果就是巴尔的摩和俄亥俄铁路的诞生 -- 美国第一条特许铁路。


Although the first railroads were successful, attempts to finance new ones originally failed as opposition was mounted by turnpike operators, canal companies, stagecoach companies and those who drove wagons. But the economic benefits of the railroad soon won over the skeptics.
尽管第一批铁路取得了成功，但为新铁路融资的尝试最初失败了，因为收费公路运营商、运河公司、驿站马车公司, 和货车司机, 都强烈反对铁路。但铁路的经济效益很快就赢得了怀疑者的支持。


Perhaps the greatest physical feat of 19th century America was the creation of the TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. Two railroads, the CENTRAL PACIFIC starting in San Francisco and a new railroad, the Union Pacific, starting in Omaha, Nebraska, would build the rail-line. Huge forces of immigrants, mainly Irish for the UNION PACIFIC and Chinese for the Central Pacific, crossed mountains, dug tunnels and laid track. The two railroads met at PROMONTORY, UTAH, on May 10, 1869.
也许 19 世纪美国最伟大的物理壮举, 就是"跨大陆铁路"的创建。有两条铁路，即始于旧金山的"中央太平洋铁路", 和一条始于"内布拉斯加州"奥马哈的新铁路，即"联合太平洋铁路"。 1869 年 5 月 10 日，两条铁路在犹他州海角相遇。


While New England was moving to mechanize manufacturing, others were working to mechanize agriculture. CYRUS MCCORMICK wanted to design equipment that would simplify farmers' work.
当"新英格兰"正在转向制造业机械化时，其他地区正在努力实现农业机械化。


Perhaps no one had as great an impact on the development of the industrial north as ELI WHITNEY. Whitney raised eyebrows when he walked into the US Patent office, took apart ten guns, and reassembled them mixing the parts of each gun. Whitney lived in an age where an artisan would handcraft each part of every gun. No two products were quite the same. Whitney's milling machine allowed workers to cut metal objects in an identical fashion, making INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS. It was the start of the concept of mass production.
也许没有人像 ELI WHITNEY 那样对北方工业的发展产生如此巨大的影响。当惠特尼走进美国专利办公室，拆开十把枪，然后将每把枪的零件混合在一起重新组装起来时，他扬起了眉毛。惠特尼生活在一个工匠手工制作每把枪的每个部件的时代。没有两种产品是完全相同的。惠特尼的铣床允许工人以相同的方式切割金属物体，制造可互换的零件。这是"大规模生产"概念的开始。


In the middle half of the nineteenth century, more than one-half of the population of IRELAND emigrated to the United States. So did an equal number of GERMANS. Most of them came because of civil unrest, severe unemployment or almost inconceivable hardships at home. This wave of immigration affected almost every city and almost every person in America. From 1820 to 1870, over seven and a half million immigrants came to the United States — more than the entire population of the country in 1810. Nearly all of them came from northern and western Europe — about a third from Ireland and almost a third from Germany. Burgeoning companies were able to absorb all that wanted to work.  Immigrants built canals and constructed railroads.  They became involved in almost every labor-intensive endeavor in the country.
**十九世纪中叶，爱尔兰一半以上的人口移民到美国。同样数量的德国人也是如此。他们中的大多数人是因为内乱、严重失业, 或国内几乎难以想象的困难, 而来到这里的。**这波移民浪潮, 几乎影响了美国的每个城市和每个人。**从 1820 年到 1870 年，超过七百五十万移民来到美国，比 1810 年全国总人口还多。**几乎所有移民都来自北欧和西欧，**大约三分之一来自爱尔兰，近三分之一来自德国。**新兴公司能够吸收所有想要工作的人。移民们修建运河和铁路。他们几乎参与了这个国家的每一项劳动密集型事业。

In Ireland almost half of the population lived on farms that produced little income. Because of their poverty, most Irish people depended on potatoes for food. When this crop failed three years in succession, it led to a great FAMINE with horrendous consequences. Over 750,000 people starved to death. Over two million Irish eventually moved to the United States seeking relief from their desolated country. Impoverished, the Irish could not buy property. Instead, they congregated in the cities where they landed, almost all in the northeastern United States. Today, Ireland has just half the population it did in the early 1840s. There are now more Irish Americans than there are Irish nationals.
在爱尔兰，几乎一半的人口生活在收入很少的农场里。由于贫困，大多数爱尔兰人以土豆为食。当这种作物连续三年歉收时，就引发了一场大饥荒，造成了可怕的后果。超过75万人饿死。超过两百万爱尔兰人最终移居美国，寻求摆脱荒凉国家的解脱。**由于贫困，爱尔兰人无法购买房产。相反，他们聚集在他们登陆的城市，几乎都在美国东北部。**如今，爱尔兰的人口只有 1840 年代初的一半。*现在爱尔兰裔美国人的数量比爱尔兰国民还要多。*

In the decade from 1845 to 1855, more than a million Germans fled to the United States to escape economic hardship. They also sought to escape the political unrest caused by riots, rebellion and eventually a revolution in 1848. The Germans had little choice — few other places besides the United States allowed German immigration. Unlike the Irish, many Germans had enough money to journey to the Midwest in search of farmland and work. The largest settlements of Germans were in New York City, Baltimore, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Milwaukee.
**1845年至1855年的十年间，超过一百万德国人为逃避经济困难逃往美国。他们还试图逃避由骚乱、叛乱和最终 1848 年革命引起的政治动荡。德国人别无选择——除了美国之外，几乎没有其他地方允许德国移民。与爱尔兰人不同，许多德国人有足够的钱前往中西部寻找农田和工作。**德国人最大的定居点位于纽约市、巴尔的摩、辛辛那提、圣路易斯和密尔沃基。

With the vast numbers of German and Irish coming to America, hostility to them erupted. Part of the reason for the opposition was religious. All of the Irish and many of the Germans were Roman Catholic. Part of the opposition was political. Most immigrants living in cities became Democrats because the party focused on the needs of commoners. Part of the opposition occurred because Americans in low-paying jobs were threatened and sometimes replaced by groups willing to work for almost nothing in order to survive.
随着大量德国人和爱尔兰人来到美国，对他们的敌意爆发了。反对的原因之一, 是宗教原因。所有爱尔兰人和许多德国人都是罗马天主教徒。反对的原因之二,是"政治" -- 大多数居住在城市的移民, 都成为民主党人，因为该党关注平民的需求。反对的原因之三, 是从事低薪工作的美国人受到了工作上的威胁，他们有时会被"愿意为了生存而几乎无偿工作的群体"所取代.

Ethnic and ANTI-CATHOLIC RIOTING occurred in many northern cites.
北部许多城市, 都发生了种族和反天主教骚乱.

== 新思想的爆发 An Explosion of New Thought

What did it mean to think like an American? Once the colonists had thrown off the burdens and controls of England, the possibilities for political, social and artistic creativity and experimentation seemed limitless. People felt optimistic and determined that a new order would be brought to bear, not just on government but on all institutions of social interaction. So, from the beginning of the 1800s until the first gunshot of the Civil War, the American experiment unfolded like an epic. Opportunity, heightened by political freedom and a surge of nationalism, caused most citizens to believe that the experiment might actually work. Thus, a uniquely American tradition in literature, art, thought, and social reform emerged.
像美国人一样思考意味着什么？**一旦殖民者摆脱了英国的负担和控制，政治、社会和艺术创造力, 和实验的可能性, 似乎是无限的。**人们感到乐观, 并决心建立新的秩序，不仅对政府, 而且对所有社会中的互动机构。**因此，从 1800 年代初, 到南北战争第一声枪响，美国的实验, 像史诗一样展开。**政治自由和民族主义高涨带来的机遇, 让大多数公民相信, 这项实验可能确实有效。由此，美国在文学、艺术、思想和社会改革方面, 形成了独特的传统。



Religion was renewed through a Second Great Awakening. Evangelists on a "divine mission" believed that churches were the proper agents of change, not violence or political movements. Ardent believers in the perfectibility of society tried communal living with distinctly utopian goals, convinced that ultimately their small fellowships would grow into larger, more influential gatherings for the common good of all. Women began to explore the possibility of individual rights and equality with men. Their agenda was quite vast and included not only the right to vote but also such diverse problems as prohibition and world peace. Reformers, sure that the dire human conditions in prisons, workhouses and asylums were the result of bad institutions and not bad people, made gallant efforts to alleviate pain and suffering. Hopes were high that cures for social disorders in America caused by rapid expansion, population growth, and industrialization would work.
宗教通过"第二次大觉醒"得到更新。肩负“神圣使命”的传教士相信，教会才是变革的适当推动者，而不是暴力或政治运动。社会完美性的热心信徒, 尝试着具有明显乌托邦目标的集体生活，相信最终他们的小型团契会发展成为更大、更有影响力的聚会，以实现所有人的共同利益。 +
女性开始探索个人权利, 和与男性平等的可能性。他们的议程相当广泛，不仅包括"投票权"，还包括"禁酒令", 和"世界和平"等各种各样的问题。 +
改革者确信，监狱、济贫院和收容所中的恶劣的人性条件, 是由糟糕的机构, 而不是坏人造成的，因此他们做出了巨大的努力来减轻痛苦和苦难。 +
*人们对治愈"美国因快速扩张、人口增长, 和工业化而造成的社会混乱"的治疗方法能够发挥作用, 寄予厚望。*

The Transcendentalists and literary lights wanted to remind everyone who he or she was and might become. Their philosophy celebrated individualism, the goodness of humankind and the benevolence of the universe.
超验主义者和文学之光, 想要提醒每个人, "他或她是谁", 以及"可能成为谁"。他们的哲学, 颂扬个人主义、人类的善良, 和宇宙的仁慈。

It was an exciting era to live in. But, like any other, it inevitably developed problems for which neither optimism nor expansion, religion nor reform could provide answers. The tragic flaw in the American experiment would slowly reveal itself in the widening breach between the North and the South over the issue of slavery. As the tone of the Abolitionist cause became more and more shrill, it began to drown out moderation, compromise and good feelings. Americans had previously been willing to argue about everything from women's rights to the virtues of homemade bread, yet rarely did they lose sight of another American's right to disagree. But the unprecedented divisiveness of the institution of slavery and the resultant catastrophe of the Civil War brought down the curtain, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, on "the better angels of our Nature."
**这是一个令人兴奋的时代。但是，与其他时代一样，它不可避免地会出现一些问题，而乐观主义或扩张、宗教或改革, 都无法解决这些问题。美国实验中的悲剧性缺陷, 将在南北"奴隶制问题"上日益扩大的分歧中, 慢慢显现出来。**随着废奴主义事业的基调, 变得越来越尖锐，它开始淹没温和、妥协和美好的感情。美国人以前愿意就从"妇女权利"到"自制面包的优点"等各种问题, 进行争论，但他们很少忽视"另一个美国人提出不同意见的权利"。但奴隶制带来的前所未有的分歧, 以及由此引发的内战灾难，用亚伯拉罕·林肯的话来说，给“我们本性中更好的天使”带来了落幕。

== 骑士精神 Chivalry


By around 1825, the dominance of Virginia was fading and the emergence of King Cotton shifted the center of Southern influence to South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.
到 1825 年左右，弗吉尼亚的统治地位逐渐减弱，棉花大王的出现将南方影响力的中心转移到了南卡罗来纳州、佐治亚州、阿拉巴马州和密西西比州。

A proper GENTLEMAN, it was believed, should be a lawyer, politician, planter, or military man, rather than be a businessman or other occupation. Because plantation owners had their money tied up in property and slaves, many of the generation could not afford to send their children to prestigious colleges, but were able to send them to the esteemed military schools. This created a generation of very able and talented military officers. Many were trained at WEST POINT and VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE. They held to old-fashioned ideals of what honorable warfare meant. When the Civil War arrived, most of the military leadership talent was southern.

== 昭昭天命 Manifest Destiny

Expansion westward seemed perfectly natural to many Americans in the mid-nineteenth century. Like the Massachusetts Puritans who hoped to build a "city upon a hill, "courageous pioneers believed that America had a divine obligation to stretch the boundaries of their noble republic to the Pacific Ocean. Independence had been won in the Revolution and reaffirmed in the War of 1812. The spirit of nationalism that swept the nation in the next two decades demanded more territory. The "every man is equal" mentality of the Jacksonian Era fueled this optimism. Now, with territory up to the Mississippi River claimed and settled and the Louisiana Purchase explored, Americans headed west in droves. Newspaper editor JOHN O'SULLIVAN coined the term "MANIFEST DESTINY" in 1845 to describe the essence of this mindset.
对于十九世纪中叶的许多美国人来说，向西扩张似乎是很自然的事情。*就像马萨诸塞州的清教徒希望建立一座“山巅之城”一样，勇敢的先驱者们相信, 美国有神圣的义务, 将他们高贵的共和国的边界, 延伸到太平洋。*"美国的独立"已经在革命中赢得，并在 1812 年的战争中得到了巩固。在接下来的二十年里, 席卷全国的民族主义精神需要更多的领土。杰克逊时代“人人平等”的心态, 助长了这种乐观情绪。现在，随着密西西比河沿岸的领土被宣称和定居，以及对路易斯安那购买地的探索，美国人成群结队地向西进发。报纸编辑约翰·奥沙利文 (JOHN O'SULLIVAN) 于 1845 年创造了**“昭昭天命”(MANIFEST DESTINY) 一词来描述这种心态的本质。**



The religious fervor spawned by the Second Great Awakening created another incentive for the drive west. Indeed, many settlers believed that God himself blessed the growth of the American nation. The Native Americans were considered heathens. By Christianizing the tribes, American missionaries believed they could save souls and they became among the first to cross the Mississippi River.
**"第二次大觉醒"引发的宗教狂热, 为西进创造了另一个动力。事实上，许多定居者相信, 上帝亲自祝福美国民族的成长。**美洲原住民被认为是异教徒。通过使部落基督教化，*美国传教士相信他们可以拯救灵魂，并成为第一批横渡密西西比河的人之一。*

Economic motives were paramount for others. The fur trade had been dominated by European trading companies since colonial times. German immigrant John Jacob Astor was one of the first American entrepreneurs to challenge the Europeans. He became a millionaire in the process. The desire for more land brought aspiring homesteaders to the frontier. When gold was discovered in California in 1848, the number of migrants increased even more.
**对于其他人来说，经济动机至关重要。**自殖民时代以来，毛皮贸易一直由欧洲贸易公司主导。德国移民约翰·雅各布·阿斯特是最早挑战欧洲人的美国企业家之一。在这个过程中他成为了百万富翁。对更多土地的渴望, 将"有抱负的自耕农"带到了边境。 1848 年，*加利福尼亚州发现金矿后，移民人数进一步增加。*

At the heart of manifest destiny was the pervasive belief in American cultural and racial superiority. Native Americans had long been perceived as inferior, and efforts to "civilize" them had been widespread since the days of John Smith and MILES STANDISH. The Hispanics who ruled Texas and the lucrative ports of California were also seen as "backward."
**"昭昭天命"的核心是, 对美国文化和种族优越性的普遍信念。**长期以来，美洲原住民一直被视为低等人，自约翰·史密斯和迈尔斯·斯坦迪什时代以来，“教化”他们的努力就已广泛存在。统治"德克萨斯州"和利润丰厚的"加利福尼亚港口"的西班牙裔, 也被视为“落后”。



Expanding the boundaries of the United States was in many ways a cultural war as well. The desire of southerners to find more lands suitable for cotton cultivation would eventually spread slavery to these regions. North of the Mason-Dixon line, many citizens were deeply concerned about adding any more slave states. Manifest destiny touched on issues of religion, money, race, patriotism, and morality. These clashed in the 1840s as a truly great drama of regional conflict began to unfold.
扩大美国疆域, 在很多方面也是一场思想文化上的战争。**南方人渴望找到更多适合棉花种植的土地，最终将"奴隶制"传播到这些地区。在梅森-迪克森线以北，许多公民对增加更多"奴隶州"深感担忧。**天命论涉及宗教、金钱、种族、爱国主义和道德等问题。这些冲突在 1840 年代发生，一场真正伟大的地区冲突戏剧开始上演。



At the time Spain granted independence to Mexico in 1821, the land now comprising the state of Texas was very sparsely populated. The Mexican government actually encouraged the settlement of the area by American pioneers.
1821 年西班牙给予墨西哥独立时，现在德克萨斯州的土地上, 人烟稀少。*墨西哥政府实际上鼓励美国拓荒者在该地区定居。*

image:/img/033.png[,30%]

In 1823, STEPHEN AUSTIN led 300 American families onto land granted to his father by the Mexican government. A prosperous province was greatly in the interest of Mexico, so no alarm was raised. Mexico was also interested in creating a buffer zone between the Mexican heartland and the COMANCHE TRIBE.
1823 年，斯蒂芬·奥斯汀带领 300 个美国家庭, 登上了墨西哥政府授予他父亲的土地。一个繁荣的省份对墨西哥来说非常有利，所以没有引起任何警报。墨西哥也有兴趣在墨西哥中心地带和科曼奇部落之间建立一个缓冲区。

There were, however, strings attached.
*然而，这是有附加条件的。*

The American settlers were expected to become Mexican. All immigrants from the United States were by law forced to become Catholic. When the Mexican government outlawed slavery in 1829, it expected the Texans to follow suit. None of the conditions were met, and a great cultural war was underway.
**美国定居者预计将成为墨西哥人。根据法律，所有来自美国的移民都被迫成为"天主教徒"。当墨西哥政府于 1829 年宣布"奴隶制"为非法时，它希望德克萨斯人也能效仿。**这些条件都不具备，一场伟大的文化战争正在进行。


relations between the Texans and the Mexicans deteriorated. On March 2, 1836, representatives from Texas formally declared their independence.
但德克萨斯人和墨西哥人之间的关系却恶化了。 1836年3月2日，德克萨斯州代表正式宣布独立。

Most TEXAN-AMERICANS wanted to be annexed by the United States. They feared that the Mexican government might soon try to recapture their land. Many had originally come from the American south and had great interest in becoming a southern state. President Andrew Jackson saw trouble. Many Whigs and Abolitionists in the North refused to admit another slave state to the Union. Rather than risk tearing the nation apart over this controversial issue, Jackson did not pursue annexation. The Lone Star flag flew proudly over the LONE STAR REPUBLIC for nine years.
大多数德克萨斯裔美国人希望被美国吞并。他们担心墨西哥政府可能很快就会试图夺回他们的土地。许多人最初来自美国南部，并对成为南部各州抱有极大的兴趣。安德鲁·杰克逊总统看到了麻烦。北方的许多辉格党人和废奴主义者拒绝接纳另一个蓄奴州加入联邦。杰克逊没有冒着因风险, 来因这个有争议的问题而导致国家陷入分裂，所以没有寻求吞并。孤星旗帜在"孤星共和国"(德克萨斯)上空, 骄傲地飘扬了九年。

Texas was an independent country.

== 奴隶制

"The PECULIAR INSTITUTION" is slavery. Its history in America begins with the earliest European settlements and ends with the Civil War. Yet its echo continues to reverberate loudly. Slavery existed both in the north and in the South, at times in equal measure. The industrialization of the north and the expansion of demand for cotton in the south shifted the balance so that it became a regional issue, as the southern economy grew increasingly reliant on cheap labor.
“特殊制度”就是**奴隶制。它在美国的历史, 始于最早的欧洲定居点，结束于内战。**然而它的回声, 仍然响亮地回荡着。奴隶制在北方和南方都存在，有时程度相当。北方的工业化, 和南方对棉花需求的扩大, 改变了平衡，使其成为一个地区性问题，因为南方经济越来越依赖廉价劳动力。

The Peculiar Institution refused to die. Great Britain had outlawed the slave trade long before its former American colonies.
特殊机构拒绝消亡。英国早在其前美洲殖民地之前, 就已宣布奴隶贸易为非法。

New nations in the Western Hemisphere, such as Mexico, often banned slavery upon achieving independence.
西半球的新国家，例如墨西哥，在获得独立后, 往往禁止奴隶制。

But in America, political, religious, economic and social arguments in favor of the continuation of slavery emerged. Slavery became a completely sectional issue, as few states above the MASON-DIXON LINE still permitted human bondage. These arguments also revealed the growing separation in the needs and priorities of the northern industrial interests versus the southern planting society, all of which culminated in the Civil War.
但在美国，支持"奴隶制继续存在"的政治、宗教、经济和社会论据出现了。奴隶制成为一个完全地区性的问题，因为"梅森-迪克森线"以上的几个州, 仍然允许奴役人类。这些论点还揭示了北方工业利益, 与南方种植社会的需求和优先事项, 日益分离，所有这些, 都在内战中达到顶峰。

Defenders of slavery noted that in the Bible, Abraham had slaves. They point to the Ten Commandments, noting that "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, ... nor his manservant, nor his maidservant." In the New Testament, Paul returned a runaway slave, Philemon, to his master, and, although slavery was widespread throughout the Roman world, Jesus never spoke out against it.
奴隶制的捍卫者指出，在圣经中，亚伯拉罕有奴隶。他们提到《十诫》，指出“不可贪图邻舍的房屋……也不可贪图他的男仆、女仆”。在新约中，保罗将逃跑的奴隶腓利门归还给他的主人，尽管奴隶制在整个罗马世界很普遍，但耶稣从未公开反对它。

Defenders of slavery argued that by comparison with the poor of Europe and the workers in the Northern states, that slaves were better cared for. They said that their owners would protect and assist them when they were sick and aged, unlike those who, once fired from their work, were left to fend helplessly for themselves.
奴隶制的捍卫者认为，与欧洲的穷人和北方各州的工人相比，奴隶得到了更好的照顾。他们说，当他们生病或年老时，主人会保护和帮助他们，不像那些一旦被解雇就只能自力更生的人。

Abolitionists were always a minority, even on the eve of the Civil War. Their dogged determination to end human bondage was a struggle that persisted for decades. While mostly peaceful at first, as each side became more and more firmly rooted, pens were exchanged for swords. Another seed of sectional conflict had been deeply planted.
即使在内战前夕，废奴主义者始终是少数。他们结束人类束缚的顽强决心是一场持续了数十年的斗争。虽然一开始基本上是和平的，但随着双方的根基越来越牢固，笔就变成了刀剑。另一领域冲突的种子已经深深埋下。



The land obtained from Mexico quickly became the subject of a bitter feud between the NORTHERN WHIGS and the SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS. Abolitionists rightly feared that attempts would be made to plant cotton in the new territory, which would bring the blight of slavery. Slaveholders feared that if slavery were prohibited in the new territory, southern slaveholding states would lose power in Congress.
从墨西哥获得的土地, 很快成为北方"辉格党"和南方"民主党"之间激烈争斗的对象。废奴主义者担心, 有人会试图在新领土上种植棉花，这会带来奴隶制的祸害，这是有道理的。奴隶主则担心，如果新领土上禁止奴隶制，南方蓄奴州将失去在国会的权力。

The specter of secession had risen again. Desperately the elder statesmen of the federal legislature proposed methods of keeping the country together.
"联邦分裂"的幽灵再次升起。联邦立法机构的元老们绝望地提出了保持国家团结的方法。


The country's founders left no clear solution to the issue of slavery in the Constitution. Popular sovereignty, amendment, nullification, and secession were all discussed as possible remedies. Conflict was avoided with the passing of the Compromise of 1850. The cooler heads prevailed — this time.
*美国的创始人, 在宪法中没有对奴隶制问题留下明确的解决方案。人民主权、修正案、废止和分裂, 都作为可能的补救措施进行了讨论。* 1850 年妥协案的通过, 避免了冲突。这一次，冷静的头脑占了上风。

As the Mexican War drew to a close and no compromise could be reached in the Wilmot argument, the campaign for President became heated. The Democratic standard bearer, LEWIS CASS of Michigan, coined the term "POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY" for a new solution that had begun to emerge. The premise was simple. Let the people of the territories themselves decide whether slavery would be permitted. The solution seemed perfect. In a country that has championed democracy, letting the people decide seemed right, if not obvious.
随着墨西哥战争接近尾声，威尔莫特的争论无法达成妥协，总统竞选变得白热化。民主党旗手、密歇根州的刘易斯·卡斯为已经开始出现的新解决方案, 创造了“人民主权”一词。前提很简单。**让这些领土的人民, 自己决定是否允许奴隶制。**这个解决方案看起来很完美。在一个崇尚民主的国家，让人民来决定似乎是正确的，即使不是显而易见的。

However simple popular sovereignty seemed, it was difficult to put into practice. By what means would the people decide? Directly or indirectly? If a popular vote were scheduled, what guarantees could be made against voter fraud? If slavery were voted down, would the individuals who already owned slaves be allowed to keep them? Cass and the Democrats did not say. His opponent, Zachary Taylor, ignored the issue of slavery altogether in his campaign, and won the ELECTION OF 1848.
"人民主权"看似简单，但落实起来却困难重重。人民将通过什么方式做出决定？直接还是间接？如果安排全民投票，可以采取哪些措施来防止选民欺诈？如果奴隶制被否决，那些已经拥有奴隶的人是否可以保留奴隶？卡斯和民主党人没有说。

HENRY CLAY of Kentucky, JOHN C. CALHOUN of South Carolina, and DANIEL WEBSTER of Massachusetts dominated national politics from the end of the War of 1812 until their deaths in the early 1850s. Although none would ever be President, the collective impact they created in Congress was far greater than any President of the era, with the exception of Andrew Jackson. There was one issue that loomed over the nation throughout their time in power — slavery. They were continuously successful in keeping peace in America by forging a series of compromises. The next generation's leaders were not.
肯塔基州的亨利·克莱、南卡罗来纳州的约翰·C·卡尔霍恩, 和马萨诸塞州的丹尼尔·韦伯斯特, 从 1812 年战争结束, 到 1850 年代初去世，一直主导着国家政治。尽管没有人成为总统，但他们在国会产生的集体影响, 远远超过了那个时代的任何一位总统（安德鲁·杰克逊除外）。*在他们执政期间，有一个问题一直笼罩着这个国家——奴隶制。他们通过达成一系列妥协，不断成功地维持了美国的和平。下一代领导人则不然。*CaliforniaMissouri


.案例
====
.Henry Clay 亨利·克莱
辉格党的创立者和领导人。美国经济现代化的倡导者。并五次参加美国总统竞选。均告失败. +
他因善于调解冲突的两方，并数次解决南北方关于奴隶制的矛盾, 维护了联邦的稳定, 而被称为“伟大的调解者”，并在1957年被评选为美国历史上最伟大的五位参议员之一。

*1820年, 南北双方为新加入联邦的"密苏里州"是否采用"蓄奴"爆发了争论。在克莱的调解下，双方同意采用"密苏里妥协案 Missouri Compromise"，即将"密苏里州"划为蓄奴州，"缅因州"为自由州，以保持参议院中"自由州"和"蓄奴州"议员数目相等，且除密苏里州以外, 不得将奴隶制扩展到北纬36度30分线以北（阿肯色州的北部边界）。*

克莱的政治能力毋庸置疑，但他坚持通过美国系统, 来发展经济, 和控制奴隶制的发展, 在当时非常不受南方的欢迎. 曾经有人规劝他能否不采取如此强硬的反对奴隶制和发展工业的姿态，克莱回答了一句, 后来常被引用的政治名言：“比起当总统，我宁可选择真理。”

... 参议院里充满了南北两方对于"奴隶制在新从墨西哥获得的土地上是否推行"的争论，南方以退出联邦作为威胁。*克莱继续发挥他的调和能力，终于促使双方达成了"1850年妥协案"，这一被称为“火山口上的盖子”的法案规定: 加利福尼亚州以"自由州"加入联邦，"新墨西哥州"和"犹他州"由居民自己决定，从而缓解了南方退出联邦的危机，被认为将美国南北战争拖延了11年。*

克莱去世后, 他墓碑上写着简单的一句：“I know no North-no South-no East-no West.”（大意：在我看来，地不分东西，人不分南北）

.John Caldwell Calhoun 约翰·C·卡尔霍恩
他是19世纪前半叶最著名的美国政治家之一.

虽然卡尔霍恩在美国南北战争爆发前十年就逝世了，但他是后来短命的"美利坚联盟国"的主要精神设计师。卡尔霍恩享有“铸铁人”之称，原因是他毫不动摇地坚持他的信仰。**他提出了"无效论"的理论。这个极端理论的内容是: 任何州在认为任何"联邦法律"违反宪法的话, 可以宣称这个法律无效。他是"奴隶制"的强烈支持者。**他对奴隶制的强烈维护, 是南方针对北方不断增强的反奴隶制态度开始威胁退出联邦的因素之一。

.Daniel Webster 丹尼尔·韦伯斯特
韦伯斯特是19世纪美国最杰出的律师之一. 他与亨利·克莱（Henry Clay）, 和约翰·卡尔霍恩（John C. Calhoun）, 并称 "三巨头"。

他强烈反对约翰·C·卡尔霍恩（John C. Calhoun）主张的废止论。 +
人们普遍认为韦伯斯特是一位重要而有才华的律师、演说家和政治家，但历史学家和观察家对他作为国家领导人的道德品质和能力却褒贬不一。

The Gold Rush led to the rapid settlement of California which resulted in its imminent admission as the 31st state. Southerners recognized that there were few slaves in California because Mexico had prohibited slavery. Immediate admission would surely mean California would be the 16th free state, giving the non-slave-holding states an edge in the Senate. Already holding the House of Representatives, the free states could then dominate legislation.
淘金热, 导致人们到加"利福尼亚州"迅速定居，**并使其即将成为美国的第 31 个州。**南方人认识到"加州"奴隶很少，因为墨西哥禁止奴隶制。*如果加州立即加入联邦, 肯定意味着加利福尼亚州将成为第 16 个"自由州"，从而使"非蓄奴州"在"参议院"获得优势。已经掌握了众议院席位的自由州, 就可以主导立法。*

Texas was claiming land that was part of New Mexico. As a slave state, any expansion of the boundaries of Texas would be opening new land to slavery. northerners were opposed. The north was also appalled at the ongoing practice of slavery in the nation's capital — a practice the south was not willing to let go. The lines were drawn as the three Senatorial giants took the stage for the last critical time.
德克萨斯州声称, 拥有属于新墨西哥州一部分的土地。**作为一个蓄奴州，德克萨斯州边界的任何扩张, 都会为奴隶制开辟新的土地。北方人反对。**北方也对国家的首都中持续存在的奴隶制而感到震惊——南方不愿意放弃这种做法。当三位参议员巨头在最后关键时刻上台时，界限已经划定。

Henry Clay had brokered compromises before. When the Congress was divided in 1820 over the issue of slavery in the Louisiana Territory, Clay set forth the MISSOURI COMPROMISE. When South Carolina nullified the tariff in 1832, Clay saved the day with the COMPROMISE TARIFF OF 1833. After 30 years in Congress and three unsuccessful attempts at the Presidency, Clay wanted badly to make good with yet another nation-saving deal. He put forth a set of eight proposals that he hoped would pass muster with his colleagues.
亨利·克莱之前曾促成过妥协。 1820 年，当国会在路易斯安那领地的奴隶制问题上出现分歧时，克莱提出了"密苏里妥协案"。 1832 年，南卡罗来纳州取消了关税，克莱通过 1833 年的"妥协关税"挽救了局面。在国会任职 30 年，并三次竞选总统失败后，克莱迫切希望达成另一项拯救国家的协议。他提出了八项提案，希望能够得到同事们的认可。



John C. Calhoun took to the floor next. Although sick and dying with consumption, he sat sternly in the Senate chamber, as his speech was read. The compromises would betray the south, he claimed. Northerners would have to agree to federal protection of slavery for the south to feel comfortable remaining in the Union. His words foreshadowed the very doom to the Union that would come within the decade.
约翰·C·卡尔霍恩 (John C. Calhoun) 接下来发言。尽管他病重并因肺病而濒临死亡，但在宣读他的演讲时，他还是严肃地坐在参议院会议厅里。他声称，妥协将背叛南方。北方人必须同意联邦政府对奴隶制的保护，南方人才能放心地留在联邦。他的话预示着联邦在十年内的厄运。

Daniel Webster spoke three days after Calhoun's speech. With the nation's fate in the balance, he pleaded with northerners to accept southern demands, for the sake of Union. Withdrawing his former support for the Wilmot Proviso, he hoped to persuade enough of his colleagues to move closer to Clay's proposals. Although there was no immediate deal, his words echoed in the minds of the Congressmen as they debated into that hot summer.
丹尼尔·韦伯斯特在卡尔霍恩演讲三天后发表了讲话。在国家命运悬而未决的情况下，他恳求北方人为了联邦而接受南方的要求。他撤回了之前对《威尔莫特条款》的支持，希望说服足够多的同事向克莱的提议靠拢。尽管没有立即达成协议，但在国会议员们辩论到那个炎热的夏天时，他的话在他们的脑海中回响。

By 1852, Clay, Calhoun, and Webster had all passed away. They left a rich legacy behind them. Clay of the West, Calhoun of the South, and Webster of the North loved and served their country greatly. The generation that followed produced no leader that could unite the country without the force of arms.
1852 年，克莱、卡尔霍恩, 和韦伯斯特, 都去世了。他们留下了丰富的遗产。西部的克莱、南部的卡尔霍恩和北部的韦伯斯特都非常热爱并为他们的国家服务。接下来的一代没有产生能够在没有武力的情况下团结国家的领导人。
