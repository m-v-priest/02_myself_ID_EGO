Knowledge of history is empowering. An event is but the furthest ripple of an ever-expanding wave that may have started eddying outward hundreds of years ago. One who "sees" history is able to harness the power of that wave's entire journey. +
历史知识可以赋予人力量。事件只是不断扩大的波浪中最远的涟漪，而波浪可能在数百年前就开始向外涡流。 “看到”历史的人能够利用那波整个旅程的力量。

There are between 140 and 160 different AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBES. There is no single Native American language. +
有 140 到 160 个不同的美洲印第安部落。没有单一的美洲原住民语言。


Twenty-seven states derive names from Indian languages. +
有二十七个州的名称源自印度语言。

Since 1492, European explorers and settlers have tended to ignore the vast diversity of the people who had previously lived here. It soon became common to lump all such groups under the term "Indian."  +
自 1492 年以来，欧洲探险家和定居者往往忽视了以前居住在这里的人们的巨大多样性。很快，将所有这些群体归为“印第安人”一词就变得很普遍。

Stereotyping Indians in this way denies the vast cultural differences between tribes. +
以这种方式对印第安人进行刻板印象，否认了部落之间巨大的文化差异。

There were over 200 North American tribes speaking over 200 different languages.  +
北美有 200 多个部落，讲 200 多种不同的语言。


Before the English arrived in North America, the Spanish, the Dutch, the Swedish, and the French were already on the scene.  +
在英国人到达北美之前，西班牙人、荷兰人、瑞典人和法国人就已经出现了。



by the time British arrived in the New World and established their first permanent settlement at Jamestown in 1607, much of the continent had already been claimed by other European nations. +
当英国人于 1607 年抵达新大陆并在詹姆斯敦建立第一个永久定居点时，其他欧洲国家已对这片大陆的大部分地区提出了主权要求。


Many factors contributed to Britain's tardiness. England was not the most powerful European nation in the 16th century. Spain was most influential. Along with Portugal, Spain dominated New World exploration in the decades that followed Columbus. France, the Netherlands, and Sweden all showed greater interest in the Western Hemisphere than England did. +
许多因素导致了英国的迟到。英国并不是16世纪欧洲最强大的国家。西班牙最具影响力。在哥伦布之后的几十年里，西班牙与葡萄牙一起主导了新大陆的勘探。法国、荷兰和瑞典对西半球的兴趣都比英国大。



Although England was an island and therefore a seafaring nation, Spain was the undisputed superpower of the seas in the 16th century. Many of England's adventurous sea captains found that plundering Spanish ships was a far simpler means of acquiring wealth than establishing colonies. +
尽管英格兰是一个岛屿，因此是一个航海国家，但西班牙却是 16 世纪无可争议的海洋超级大国。许多富有冒险精神的英国船长发现，掠夺西班牙船只是比建立殖民地简单得多的获取财富的手段。


PHILIP was certain that his great fleet of ships would put an end to England's piracy. In 1588, one of the greatest turning points in world history occurred when Spain's "invincible" ARMADA of 130 ships sailed into the English Channel. Despite their numerical inferiority, the English ships were faster and easier to maneuver than the Spanish fleet. With the aid of a great storm, Elizabeth's ships humiliated Philip's navy, which returned to Spain with fewer than half their original number. +
菲利普确信他的庞大舰队将终结英国的海盗行为。 1588 年，世界历史上最伟大的转折点之一发生了，西班牙由 130 艘船组成的“无敌”舰队驶入英吉利海峡。尽管数量上处于劣势，但英国船只比西班牙舰队更快、更容易操纵。在一场大风暴的帮助下，伊丽莎白的船只羞辱了腓力的海军，后者返回西班牙时人数不足原来的一半。

This battle marked the beginning of the end of Spain's domination of Europe and the Western Hemisphere. More importantly for England, it marked the dawn of the era of permanent ENGLISH SETTLEMENT of the New World. +
这场战役标志着西班牙对欧洲和西半球统治地位结束的开始。对于英国来说更重要的是，它标志着新世界的英国永久定居时代的黎明。

As tensions flared between England and Spain, it soon became sensible for England to establish permanent settlements in the New World to rival the Spanish. If nothing more, they could serve as bases from which to raid Spanish ships. +
随着英格兰和西班牙之间的紧张局势加剧，英格兰在新世界建立永久定居点以与西班牙竞争很快就变得明智。如果没有更多的话，它们可以作为袭击西班牙船只的基地。

Compared with other European nations in 1600, England was relatively poor. +
与1600年的其他欧洲国家相比，英国相对贫穷。

As new agricultural techniques made fewer farmers necessary, the poor multiplied in the streets of cities such as LONDON and Bristol.  +
随着新的农业技术减少了需要的农民，伦敦和布里斯托尔等城市街道上的穷人数量成倍增加。

Richard Hakluyt, a 16th-century geographer interested in explorers and travel narratives, suggested to Queen Elizabeth that New World colonies could serve two purposes. First, they could challenge Spanish domination of the New World. Second, the ever-growing poorer classes could be transported there, easing England's population pressures. +
理查德·哈克卢特 (Richard Hakluyt) 是一位对探险家和旅行叙事感兴趣的 16 世纪地理学家，他向伊丽莎白女王建议，新世界殖民地可以有两个目的。首先，他们可以挑战西班牙对新大陆的统治。其次，不断增长的贫困阶层可以被转移到那里，从而缓解英格兰的人口压力。

The joint-stock company was the forerunner of the modern corporation. In a JOINT-STOCK VENTURE, stock was sold to high net-worth investors who provided CAPITAL and had limited RISK. These companies had proven profitable in the past with trading ventures. The risk was small, and the returns were fairly quick.
股份公司是现代企业的前身。在合资企业中，股票被出售给提供资本且风险有限的高净值投资者。事实证明，这些公司过去通过贸易业务实现了盈利。风险很小，回报也很快。

The risk was larger as the colony might fail. The STARTUP COSTS were enormous and the returns might take years. Investors in such endeavors needed more than a small sense of adventure.
风险更大，因为殖民地可能会失败。启动成本巨大，回报可能需要数年时间。从事此类事业的投资者需要的不仅仅是一点点冒险精神。


the joint-stock company became the vehicle by which England finally settled the Western Hemisphere.
股份公司成为英国最终定居西半球的工具。

This starkly contrasted with Spanish and French settlements. New Spain and New France were developed by their kings. The English colonies were developed by their people. Many historians argue that the primary reason the relatively small and late English colonization effort ultimately outlasted its predecessors was because individuals had a true stake in its success.
这与西班牙和法国的定居点形成鲜明对比。新西班牙和新法兰西是由他们的国王开发的。英国殖民地是由他们的人民开发的。许多历史学家认为，相对较小且较晚的英国殖民努力最终比其前辈更持久的主要原因是个人对其成功有着真正的利害关系。


The first joint-stock company to launch a lasting venture to the New World was the VIRGINIA COMPANY OF LONDON. The investors had one goal in mind: gold. They hoped to repeat the success of Spaniards who found gold in South America.
第一家在新世界开展持久投资的股份公司是伦敦弗吉尼亚公司。投资者心中只有一个目标：黄金。他们希望重复西班牙人在南美洲发现黄金的成功。

Investments in permanent settlements were risky indeed. The merchants and gentry paid with their pocketbooks. Many colonists paid with their lives. For every six colonists who ventured across the Atlantic, only one survived.
对永久定居点的投资确实存在风险。商人和士绅用他们的钱袋支付。许多殖民者付出了生命的代价。每六名冒险横渡大西洋的殖民者中，只有一人幸存。


Virginia's economic future did not lie with gold. There was too little gold to be found there. Looking for new ways to make its investments pay dividends, the Virginia Company of London began encouraging multiple ventures by 1618.
弗吉尼亚州的经济未来并不取决于黄金。那里的金子太少了，找不到。为了寻找新的方式让其投资产生股息，伦敦弗吉尼亚公司于 1618 年开始鼓励多种合资企业。

Jamestown settlers experimented with GLASSBLOWING, VINEYARD cultivation, and even silkworm farming. Despite efforts to diversify Virginia's economy, by the end of the 1620s only one Virginia crop was drawing a fair market price in England: tobacco.
詹姆斯敦的定居者尝试了玻璃吹制、葡萄园种植，甚至养蚕。尽管弗吉尼亚州努力实现经济多元化，但到 1620 年代末，弗吉尼亚州只有一种作物在英国获得了公平的市场价格：烟草。


The tobacco economy rapidly began to shape the society and development of the colony. Growing tobacco takes its toil on the soil. Because tobacco drained the soil of its nutrients, only about three successful growing seasons could occur on a plot of land. Then the land had to lie fallow for three years before the soil could be used again. This created a huge drive for new farmland. Naturally, the colony began to expand.
烟草经济迅速开始塑造殖民地的社会和发展。种植烟草需要在土壤上付出辛劳。由于烟草耗尽了土壤的养分，一块土地上只能出现大约三个成功的生长季节。然后，土地必须休耕三年才能再次使用。这为新农田创造了巨大的动力。自然地，殖民地开始扩大。

Warfare and disease eliminated about 90% percent of the Native American population in Virginia within the first 60 years of English settlement.
在英国人定居的最初 60 年内，战争和疾病消灭了弗吉尼亚州约 90% 的美洲原住民人口。
