=== 54. A New Civil Rights Movement 新民权运动


In 1950, the United States operated under an apartheid-like system of legislated white supremacy.
1950年，美国在类似"种族隔离"的"白人至上"立法制度下运作。

Although the Civil War did bring an official end to slavery in the United States, it did not erase the social barriers built by that "PECULIAR INSTITUTION."
尽管内战确实正式结束了美国的奴隶制，但它并没有消除该“特殊制度”所建立的社会障碍。

Despite the efforts of RADICAL RECONSTRUCTIONISTS, the American South emerged from the CIVIL WAR with a system of laws that undermined the freedom of African Americans and preserved many elements of white privilege. No major successful attack was launched on the segregation system until the 1950s.
尽管激进的重建主义者做出了努力，但美国南方在内战结束后，出现了一套法律体系，削弱了非裔美国人的自由，并保留了许多白人特权的要素。直到 20 世纪 50 年代，才对种族隔离制度发起了重大成功的攻击。



Beginning with the Supreme Court's school integration ruling of 1954, the American legal system seemed sympathetic to African American demands that their FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT CIVIL RIGHTS be protected. Soon, a peaceful equality movement began under the unofficial leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A wave of marches, boycotts, sit-ins, and freedom rides swept the American South and even parts of the North.
从 1954 年最高法院的"学校融合"裁决开始，美国法律体系似乎同情非裔美国人要求保护他们的第十四条修正案公民权利。很快，在马丁·路德·金博士的非正式领导下，一场和平的平等运动开始了。游行、抵制、静坐和自由骑行的浪潮, 席卷了美国南部甚至北部部分地区。

Public opinion polls across the nation and the world revealed a great deal of sympathy for African Americans. The Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations gave the Civil Rights Movement at least tacit support. Although many obstacles to complete racial equity remained, by 1965 most legal forms of discrimination had been abolished.
全国和世界各地的民意调查显示，人们对非裔美国人抱有极大的同情。艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪和约翰逊政府, 至少给予了民权运动默许的支持。*尽管"实现种族平等"的障碍仍然存在，但到 1965 年，大多数合法形式的歧视已经被废除。*


Legal equality did not bring economic equality and social acceptance. Gains made by civil rights activists did not bring greater unity in the movement. On the contrary, as the 1960s progressed, a radical wing of the movement grew stronger and stronger. Influenced by Malcolm X, the Black Power Movement rejected the policy of nonviolence at all costs and even believed integration was not a desirable short-term goal. Black nationalists called for the establishment of a nation of African Americans dependent on each other for support without the interference or help of whites.
法律平等并没有带来经济平等和社会接受。民权活动人士取得的成果. 并没有给运动带来更大的团结。相反，**随着 20 世纪 60 年代的进展，运动中的"激进派"变得越来越强大。**受马尔科姆·艾克斯的影响，*黑人权力运动, 不惜一切代价拒绝"非暴力"政策，甚至认为"融合"并不是一个理想的短期目标。黑人民族主义者呼吁建立一个非裔美国人相互依赖、相互支持、不受白人干涉或帮助的国家。*

Race-related violence began to spread across the country. Beginning in 1964, a series of "long, hot summers" of rioting plagued urban centers. More and more individuals dedicated to African American causes became victims of assassination. Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr. were a few of the more famous casualties of the tempest.
与种族有关的暴力, 开始在全国蔓延。从 1964 年开始，一系列“漫长而炎热的夏天”的骚乱, 困扰着城市中心。越来越多致力于非裔美国人事业的个人, 成为暗杀的受害者。梅德加·埃弗斯（Medgar Evers）、马尔科姆·艾克斯（Malcolm X）和小马丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）, 是这场风暴中较为著名的遇难者。

Hope and optimism gave way to alienation and despair as the 1970s began. Many realized that although changing racist laws was actually relatively simple, changing racist attitudes was a much more difficult task.
*20 世纪 70 年代开始，"希望"和"乐观主义", 被"疏远"和"绝望"所取代。许多人意识到，虽然改"变种族主义的法律"实际上相对简单，但"改变种族主义的态度", 却是一项艰巨的任务。*

====  Separate No Longer? 不再分开？



Jim Crow laws existed in several southern states and served to reinforce the white authority that had been lost following Reconstruction. One such law required blacks and whites to drink from separate water fountains.
南部几个州存在种族隔离法，旨在加强重建后失去的白人权威。其中一项法律要求, 黑人和白人从不同的饮水机喝水。

During the first half of the 20th century, the United States existed as two nations in one.
20世纪上半叶，美国作为两个国家合而为一。

The Supreme Court ruling in PLESSY V. FERGUSON (1896) decreed that the legislation of two separate societies — one black and one white — was permitted as long as the two were equal.
最高法院在《普莱西诉弗格森案》（PLESSY V. FERGUSON，1896）中做出的裁决规定，只要两个独立的社会——一个黑人和一个白人——的立法是允许的，只要两个社会平等。

States across the North and South passed laws creating schools and public facilities for each race. These regulations, known as Jim Crow laws, reestablished white authority after it had diminished during the Reconstruction era. Across the land, blacks and whites dined at separate restaurants, bathed in separate swimming pools, and drank from separate water fountains.
南北各州通过了法律，为每个种族建立学校和公共设施。这些被称为"吉姆·克劳法"的法规, 在重建时期削弱了白人权威后又重新建立了它。在这片土地上，黑人和白人在不同的餐厅用餐，在不同的游泳池洗澡，从不同的喷泉喝水。

.Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法
是1876年至1965年间, 美国南部各州以及边境各州对有色人种（主要针对非洲裔美国人，但同时也包含其他族群）实行"种族隔离制度"的法律。

这些法律上的种族隔离, **强制公共设施必须依照种族的不同, 而隔离使用，**且在"隔离但平等"的原则下，"种族隔离"被解释为不违反宪法保障的同等保护权，因此得以持续存在。*但事实上, 黑人所能享有的部分与白人相较往往是较差的，而这样的差别待遇, 也造成了黑人长久以来处于经济、教育及社会上较为弱势的地位。*

1865年至1876年的"重建时期"，联邦法律为南方的自由黑人, 提供一定程度的民权保护。重建时期结束后，南方各州政府、立法机构, 及法院, 重新被南方白人所掌控，一系列"吉姆·克劳法"被通过，扩大用来隔离其他非白人种族。

1945年后，非裔美国人民权运动兴起，民权团体用联邦法律来抵抗吉姆·克劳法。例如著名的“布朗诉托皮卡教育局案”（1954年），由第14任美国首席大法官厄尔·沃伦领导的美国最高法院通过判决，九位大法官一致同意终止了公立学校中的种族隔离。

而后，沃伦法院进一步在不同案件中, 逐步废除了吉姆·克劳法，主要包括"亚特兰大之心汽车旅馆诉美国案"（1965年）。

而**美国国会也在1964年通过《1964年民权法案》及《1965年投票权法案》，禁止法律上有任何形式的种族隔离和歧视政策，"吉姆·克劳法"在法律层面上正式走入历史。**

The United States had established an American brand of apartheid.
美国已经树立了美国式的"种族隔离制度"。

In the aftermath of World War II, America sought to demonstrate to the world the merit of free democracies over communist dictatorships. But its segregation system exposed fundamental hypocrisy. Change began brewing in the late 1940s. President Harry Truman ordered the end of segregation in the armed services, But the wall built by JIM CROW legislation seemed insurmountable.
第二次世界大战后，美国试图向世界展示"自由民主"相对于"共产主义独裁"的优点。但其"隔离制度"暴露了根本的虚伪。 20 世纪 40 年代末，变革开始酝酿。哈里·杜鲁门总统下令结束军队中的种族隔离，但吉姆·克劳立法所筑起的围墙似乎难以逾越。

The first major battleground was in the schools. It was very clear by mid-century that southern states had expertly enacted separate educational systems. These schools, however, were never equal. The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE (NAACP), led by attorney THURGOOD MARSHALL, sued public schools across the South, insisting that the "SEPARATE BUT EQUAL" CLAUSE had been violated.
第一个主战场是在学校。到本世纪中叶，很明显，南方各州已经巧妙地制定了独立的教育制度。然而，这些学校从来都不平等。由律师瑟古德·马歇尔领导的全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）, 起诉了南方各地的公立学校，坚称其违反了“隔离但平等”条款。


In no state where distinct racial education laws existed was there equality in public spending. Teachers in white schools were paid better wages, school buildings for white students were maintained more carefully, and funds for educational materials flowed more liberally into white schools. States normally spent 10 to 20 times on the education of white students as they spent on African American students.
在任何一个存在不同种族教育法的州，公共支出都是平等的。白人学校的教师工资更高，白人学生的校舍得到更精心的维护，教材资金更自由地流入白人学校。各州在白人学生教育上的支出通常是非裔美国学生教育支出的 10 到 20 倍。

The Supreme Court finally decided to rule on this subject in 1954 in the landmark BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION OF TOPEKA case.
最高法院最终于 1954 年在具有里程碑意义的“布朗诉托皮卡教育委员会”案中决定就此问题做出裁决。

The verdict was unanimous against segregation. "Separate facilities are inherently unequal," read Chief Justice EARL WARREN's opinion. Warren worked tirelessly to achieve a 9-0 ruling. He feared any dissent might provide a legal argument for the forces against integration. The united Supreme Court sent a clear message: schools had to integrate.
判决一致反对种族隔离。 “独立的设施本质上是不平等的，”首席大法官厄尔·沃伦 (EARL WARREN) 的观点如下。沃伦不知疲倦地努力取得了9-0的裁决。他担心, 任何异议都可能为反对融合的势力提供法律依据。联合的最高法院发出了明确的信息：学校必须整合。

Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka
May 17, 1954, saw the Supreme Court — in the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka — rule that segregation of public schools was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that all citizens deserve equal protection under the law.
1954 年 5 月 17 日，最高法院在"布朗诉托皮卡教育委员会案"中, 裁定公立学校的种族隔离, 违反了第十四修正案，该修正案规定, 所有公民都应受到法律的平等保护。

The North and the border states quickly complied with the ruling, but the Brown decision fell on deaf ears in the South. The Court had stopped short of insisting on immediate integration, instead asking local governments to proceed "with all deliberate speed" in complying.
北方和边境各州很快遵守了裁决，但南方对布朗的决定置若罔闻。法院没有坚持立即整合，而是要求地方政府“以审慎的速度”遵守规定。

Ten years after Brown, fewer than ten percent of Southern public schools had integrated. Some areas achieved a zero percent compliance rate. The ruling did not address separate restrooms, bus seats, or hotel rooms, so Jim Crow laws remained intact. But cautious first steps toward an equal society had been taken.
布朗大学毕业十年后，只有不到百分之十的南方公立学校, 实现了一体化。一些地区的达标率为零。该裁决没有涉及单独的卫生间、公交车座位, 或酒店房间，因此吉姆·克劳法保持不变。但迈向平等社会的第一步是谨慎的。

It would take a decade of protest, legislation, and bloodshed before America neared a truer equality.
*美国花了十年的抗议、立法和流血, 才接近真正的平等。*


In 1959, Congress passed the CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, the first such measure since Reconstruction. The law created a permanent civil rights commission to assist black suffrage. The measure had little teeth and proved ineffective, but it paved the way for more powerful legislation in the years to come.
**1959 年，国会通过了《民权法案》，这是重建以来的第一项此类措施。该法律设立了一个常设"民权委员会"来协助黑人选举权。这项措施效果不大，而且被证明是无效的，但它为未来几年更强有力的立法铺平了道路。**

==== The Sit-In Movement 静坐运动


By 1960, the Civil Rights Movement had gained strong momentum. The nonviolent measures employed by Martin Luther King Jr. helped African American activists win supporters across the country and throughout the world.
到1960年，民权运动势头强劲。马丁·路德·金采取的非暴力措施, 帮助非裔美国活动人士赢得了全国和世界各地的支持者。

On February 1, 1960, a new tactic was added to the peaceful activists' strategy. Four African American college students walked up to a whites-only lunch counter at the local WOOLWORTH'S store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked for coffee. When service was refused, the students sat patiently. Despite threats and intimidation, the students sat quietly and waited to be served.
1960 年 2 月 1 日，和平活动分子的策略中, 增加了一项新策略。四名非裔美国大学生, 走到北卡罗来纳州格林斯博罗当地 WOOLWORTH'S 商店的白人专用午餐柜台前，要了咖啡。*当服务被拒绝时，学生们耐心地坐着。尽管受到威胁和恐吓，学生们还是安静地坐着等待服务。*

The civil rights sit-in was born.
*"民权静坐"就此诞生。*

No one participated in a sit-in of this sort without seriousness of purpose. The instructions were simple: sit quietly and wait to be served. Often the participants would be jeered and threatened by local customers. Sometimes they would be pelted with food or ketchup. Angry onlookers tried to provoke fights that never came. In the event of a physical attack, the student would curl up into a ball on the floor and take the punishment. Any violent reprisal would undermine the spirit of the sit-in. When the local police came to arrest the demonstrators, another line of students would take the vacated seats.
没有人不带着严肃的目的参加这种静坐。*指示很简单：安静地坐着等待服务。参与者常常会受到当地客户的嘲笑和威胁。有时他们会被扔食物或番茄酱。愤怒的旁观者试图挑起打斗，但打斗从未发生过。如果发生身体攻击，学生会在地板上蜷缩成球并接受惩罚。任何暴力报复都会破坏静坐的精神。当当地警察来逮捕示威者时，另一排学生就会占据空出的座位。*




SIT-IN organizers believed that if the violence were only on the part of the white community, the world would see the righteousness of their cause. Before the end of the school year, over 1500 black demonstrators were arrested. But their sacrifice brought results. Slowly, but surely, restaurants throughout the South began to abandon their policies of segregation.
静坐抗议的组织者相信，如果暴力只发生在白人社区，世界就会看到他们事业的正义性。学年结束前，已有 1500 多名黑人示威者被捕。但他们的牺牲带来了结果。慢慢地，但可以肯定的是，整个南方的餐馆开始放弃种族隔离政策。

In April 1960, Martin Luther King Jr. sponsored a conference to discuss strategy. Students from the North and the South came together and formed the STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE (SNCC). Early leaders included STOKELY CARMICHAEL and FANNIE LOU HAMER. The CONGRESS ON RACIAL EQUALITY (CORE) was a northern group of students led by JAMES FARMER, which also endorsed direct action. These groups became the grassroots organizers of future sit-ins at lunch counters, wade-ins at segregated swimming pools, and pray-ins at white-only churches.
1960 年 4 月，马丁·路德·金主办了一次讨论战略的会议。来自北方和南方的学生聚集在一起，成立了学生非暴力协调委员会（SNCC）。早期的领导者包括, 斯托克利·卡迈克尔 (STOKELY CARMICHAEL) 和范妮·卢·哈默 (FANNIE LOU HAMER)。种族平等大会（CORE）是由詹姆斯·法默（JAMES FARMER）领导的北方学生团体，该团体也支持直接行动。这些团体成为未来午餐柜台静坐、隔离游泳池涉水以及在白人教堂祈祷的基层组织者。


New ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY ordered federal marshals to protect future freedom rides. Bowing to political and public pressure, the INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION soon banned segregation on interstate travel. Progress was slow indeed, but the wall between the races was gradually being eroded.
新任总检察长罗伯特·肯尼迪, 命令"联邦法警"保护未来的自由乘车。*迫于政治和公众压力，州际商务委员会很快禁止州际旅行中的种族隔离。进展确实缓慢，但种族之间的隔阂正在逐渐被侵蚀。*

==== Gains and Pains 收获与痛苦


Civil rights activists in the early 1960s teemed with enthusiasm. The courts and the federal government seemed to be on their side, and the movement was winning the battle for public opinion.
20 世纪 60 年代初的民权活动人士, 热情高涨。法院和联邦政府似乎都站在他们一边，这场运动正在赢得舆论之战。

As sit-ins and freedom rides spread across the South, African American leaders set a new, ambitious goal: a federal law banning racial discrimination in all public accommodations and in employment. In the summer of 1963, President Kennedy indicated he would support such a measure, and thousands marched on Washington to support the bill.
*随着"静坐"和"自由乘车"运动在南方蔓延，非裔美国领导人制定了一个雄心勃勃的新目标：制定联邦法律，禁止所有公共设施和就业中的种族歧视。* 1963 年夏天，肯尼迪总统表示m 他将支持这项措施，数千人在华盛顿游行支持该法案。

Blacks and whites sang "WE SHALL OVERCOME" and listened to Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his "I HAVE A DREAM" speech. The Civil Rights Movement seemed on the brink of triumph.
黑人和白人唱着“我们将克服”，并聆听小马丁·路德·金发表“我有一个梦想”演讲。民权运动似乎即将取得胜利。

As equality advocates notched more and more successes, the forces against change grew more active as well. Groups such the Ku Klux Klan increased hate crimes.
**随着平等倡导者取得越来越多的成功，反对变革的力量也变得更加活跃。**三K党等团体增加了仇恨犯罪。



16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, served as a meeting place for many participants of the civil rights movement. Tragedy struck the church in 1963 when a bomb exploded there, killing four young girls and injuring 22 others.
阿拉巴马州伯明翰的第 16 街浸信会教堂m 是许多民权运动参与者的聚会场所。 1963 年，教堂发生了一场悲剧，一枚炸弹在那里爆炸，造成 4 名年轻女孩死亡，另有 22 人受伤。

NAACP leader Medgar Evers was murdered in cold blood that summer in Mississippi as he tried to enter his home.
那年夏天，"全国有色人种协进会"领导人梅德加·埃弗斯, 在密西西比州试图进入家中时, 被冷血杀害。



Many who had looked to JOHN F. KENNEDY as a sympathetic leader were crushed when he fell victim to assassination in November 1963. But Kennedy's death did not derail the Civil Rights Act.
当约翰·F·肯尼迪于 1963 年 11 月遭遇暗杀时，许多曾将他视为富有同情心的领导人的人都崩溃了。但肯尼迪的死, 并没有破坏**《民权法案》。**

PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON signed the bill into law in July 1964. As of that day, it became illegal to refuse employment to an individual on the basis of race. Segregation at any public facility in America was now against the law.
*1964 年 7 月，林登·约翰逊总统签署该法案, 成为法律。从那天起，基于种族原因而拒绝雇用个人的行为, 就成为违法行为。现在，美国任何公共设施中的种族隔离, 都是违法的。*



The passage of that act led to a new focus. Many African Americans had been robbed of the right to vote since southern states enacted discriminatory poll taxes and literacy tests. Only five percent of African Americans eligible to vote were registered in Mississippi in 1965. The 24TH AMENDMENT banned the POLL TAX in 1964. A new landmark law, the VOTING RIGHTS ACT of 1965, banned the literacy test and other such measures designed to keep blacks from voting. It also placed federal registrars in the South to ensure black suffrage. By 1965, few legal barriers to racial equality remained.
该法案的通过, 带来了新的焦点。自从南方各州实施歧视性"人头税"和"识字测试"以来，许多非裔美国人被剥夺了投票权。 1965 年，只有 5% 有资格投票的非裔美国人, 在密西西比州登记。1964 年，第 24 条修正案禁止征收投票税。一项具有里程碑意义的新法律，即 *1965 年的《投票权法案》，禁止了识字测试和其他旨在阻止黑人投票的措施。它还在南方安置了联邦登记员，以确保黑人的选举权。到 1965 年，种族平等的法律障碍, 已所剩不多。*

But centuries of racism could not be erased with the pen. Many African Americans continued to languish in the bottom economic strata. Civil rights activists fought on to achieve economic as well as legal equality. It is a fight that continues to this day.
但几个世纪以来的种族主义, 无法用笔(即法律)抹去。许多非裔美国人继续在经济底层苦苦挣扎。民权活动人士为实现经济和法律平等而奋斗。这场斗争一直持续到今天。

In the words of Martin Luther King Jr.:
用马丁·路德·金的话来说：

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."
我有一个梦想，有一天这个国家将会崛起并实现其信条的真正含义：“我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的：人人生而平等。”

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.
我梦想有一天，在乔治亚州的红色山岗上，昔日奴隶的儿子能够和昔日奴隶主的儿子, 同席而坐，亲如手足。

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
我梦想有一天，甚至连密西西比州，一个沙漠之州，一个非正义之州，一个压迫之州，也将变成自由和正义的绿洲。

I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.
我梦想有一天，我的四个孩子将生活在一个不是以"皮肤的颜色"，而是以"品格的优劣"来评价他们的国度里。今天我有一个梦想。

==== Martin Luther King Jr. 马丁路德金


As the unquestioned leader of the peaceful Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. was at the same time one of the most beloved and one of the most hated men of his time. From his involvement in the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 until his untimely death in 1968, King's message of change through peaceful means added to the movement's numbers and gave it its moral strength. The legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. is embodied in these two simple words: equality and nonviolence.
作为 20 世纪 60 年代和平民权运动无可争议的领袖，DR.马丁路德金。他同时是他那个时代最受爱戴的人之一，也是最令人憎恨的人之一。从 1955 年参与蒙哥马利公交车抵制运动, 到 1968 年英年早逝，金通过和平方式传达的变革信息, 增加了该运动的人数，并赋予其道德力量。马丁·路德·金的遗产, 体现在这两个简单的词中："平等"和"非暴力"。

King was raised in an activist family. His father was deeply influenced by MARCUS GARVEY's BACK TO AFRICA MOVEMENT in the 1920s. His mother was the daughter of one of Atlanta's most influential African American ministers.
金在一个积极分子家庭中长大。他的父亲深受 20 年代马库斯·加维 (MARCUS GARVEY) 的“重返非洲运动”的影响。他的母亲是亚特兰大最有影响力的非裔美国牧师之一的女儿。



After his organization of the bus boycott, King formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which dedicated itself to the advancement of rights for African Americans. In April 1963, King organized a protest in Birmingham, Alabama, a city King called "the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States." Since the end of World War II, there had been 60 unsolved bombings of African American churches and homes.
在组织公交车抵制活动后，金成立了南方基督教领袖会议，致力于促进非裔美国人的权利。 1963年4月，金在阿拉巴马州伯明翰组织了一场抗议活动，金称这座城市为“美国种族隔离最彻底的城市”。自二战结束以来，已有 60 起针对非裔美国人教堂和住宅的爆炸事件尚未解决。

Boycotts, sit-ins and marches were conducted. When Bull Connor, head of the Birmingham police department, used fire hoses and dogs on the demonstrators, millions saw the images on television. King was arrested. But support came from around the nation and the world for King and his family. Later in 1963, he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech to thousands in Washington, D.C.
抵制、静坐和游行都在进行。当伯明翰警察局局长布尔·康纳（Bull Connor）对示威者使用消防水龙带和警犬时，数百万人在电视上看到了这些画面。金被捕。但全国和世界各地都对金和他的家人表示支持。 1963 年晚些时候，他在华盛顿特区向数千人发表了著名的“我有一个梦想”演讲。

Selma to Montgomery
In March 1965, Dr. King led protestors on a 50-mile, voting-rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. It took three attempts for the protestors to complete the march, battling tear gas, cattle prods, and police batons, but the national attention drawn by their efforts ultimately led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
1965 年 3 月，金博士带领抗议者, 从塞尔玛到阿拉巴马州蒙哥马利, 进行了 50 英里的投票权游行。抗议者在与催泪瓦斯、牛棒和警棍的对抗中, 三次尝试才完成游行，但他们的努力引起了全国的关注，最终导致了 1965 年"投票权法案"的通过。

After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, King turned his efforts to registering African American voters in the South. In 1965, he led a march in Selma, Alabama, to increase the percentage of African American voters in Alabama. Again, King was arrested. Again, the marchers faced attacks by the police. Tear gas, cattle prods, and billy clubs fell on the peaceful demonstrators. Public opinion weighed predominantly on the side of King and the protesters. Finally, President Johnson ordered the National Guard to protect the demonstrators from attack, and King was able to complete the long march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery. The action in Selma led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
1964 年《民权法案》通过后，金将工作重点转向南方非裔美国选民登记。 1965年，他在阿拉巴马州塞尔玛领导了一场游行，以提高阿拉巴马州非裔美国选民的比例。金再次被捕。游行者再次遭到警察的袭击。催泪瓦斯、牛棒和警棍落在和平示威者身上。公众舆论主要站在金和抗议者一边。最后，约翰逊总统命令国民警卫队保护示威者免受袭击，金才得以完成从塞尔玛到州首府蒙哥马利的长征。塞尔玛的行动导致 1965 年投票权法案的通过。

Early in the morning of April 4, 1968, King was shot by JAMES EARL RAY. Spontaneous violence spread through urban areas as mourners unleashed their rage at the loss of their leader. Rioting burst forth in many American cities.
1968 年 4 月 4 日清晨，金被詹姆斯·厄尔·雷 (JAMES EARL RAY) 枪杀。随着哀悼者对失去领导人的愤怒，自发的暴力在城市地区蔓延。美国许多城市爆发骚乱。

But the world never forgot his contributions. Time magazine had named him "Man of the Year" in 1963. In 1964, he won the Nobel Peace Prize and was described as "the first person in the Western world to have shown us that a struggle can be waged without violence." In 1977, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award a civilian American can earn. In the 1980s, his birthday became a national holiday, creating an annual opportunity for Americans to reflect on the two values he dedicated his life to advancing: equality and nonviolence.
但世界从未忘记他的贡献。 1963年，《时代》杂志将他评为“年度人物”。1964年，**他获得了诺贝尔和平奖，并被描述为“西方世界第一个向我们表明, 可以在不使用暴力的情况下, 进行斗争的人”。 **1977年，*他被追授"总统自由勋章"，这是美国平民可以获得的最高奖项。* 20 世纪 80 年代，他的生日成为全国性节日，为美国人创造了一年一度的机会, 来反思他一生致力于推进的两种价值观：平等和非暴力。

==== Black Power  黑人力量

Despite legislative gains against discriminatory policies, America was moving toward two distinct societies divided along racial lines.
尽管在反对歧视政策的立法方面, 取得了进展，但美国正在走向两个"按种族界限划分"的不同社会。

As Martin Luther King preached his gospel of peaceful change and integration in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Malcolm X delivered a different message: whites were not to be trusted. He called on African Americans to be proud of their heritage and to set up strong communities without the help of white Americans. He promoted the establishment of a separate state for African Americans in which they could rely on themselves to provide solutions to their own problems. Violence was not the only answer, but violence was justified in self-defense. Blacks should achieve what was rightfully theirs "by any means necessary."
当马丁·路德·金在 20 世纪 50 年代末, 和 1960 年代初, 宣扬"和平变革"与"融合"的福音时，马尔科姆·X 则传达了不同的信息：白人不值得信任。他呼吁非裔美国人为自己的传统感到自豪，并在没有美国白人帮助的情况下来建立强大的社区。*他推动为非裔美国人建立一个独立的国家，让他们可以依靠自己来解决自己的问题。暴力不是唯一的答案，但自卫时使用暴力是正当的。黑人应该“通过任何必要的手段”实现他们应有的目标。*

As Malcolm X led a mass rally in Harlem on February 21, 1965, rival Black Muslims gunned him down.

Carmichael and McKissick were heavily influenced by the words of Malcolm X, and rejected integration as a short-term goal. Carmichael felt that blacks needed to feel a sense of racial pride and self-respect before any meaningful gains could be achieved. He encouraged the strengthening of African American communities without the help of whites.
卡迈克尔和麦基西克, 深受马尔科姆·X 言论的影响，拒绝将"融合"作为短期目标。卡迈克尔认为，黑人需要感受到种族自豪感和自尊感，才能取得任何有意义的成就。他鼓励在没有白人帮助的情况下加强非裔美国人社区。



Chapters of SNCC and CORE — both integrated organizations — began to reject white membership as Carmichael abandoned peaceful resistance. Martin Luther King Jr. and the NAACP denounced black power as the proper forward path. But black power was a powerful message in the streets of urban America, where resentment boiled and tempers flared.
随着卡迈克尔放弃和平抵抗，SNCC 和 CORE 这两个综合组织的分会, 开始拒绝白人的会员资格。小马丁·路德·金和全国有色人种协进会, 谴责"黑人权力是正确的前进道路"。但在美国城市的街道上，黑人权力是一个强有力的信息，那里的怨恨沸腾，脾气暴躁。

Soon, African American students began to celebrate African American culture boldly and publicly. Colleges teemed with young blacks wearing traditional African colors and clothes. Soul singer JAMES BROWN had his audience chanting "Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud." Hairstyles unique to African Americans became popular and youths proclaimed, "BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL!"
很快，非裔美国学生开始大胆、公开地庆祝非裔美国文化。大学里挤满了穿着非洲传统颜色和服装的年轻黑人。灵魂歌手詹姆斯·布朗让观众高呼“大声说，我是黑人，我很自豪”。非裔美国人特有的发型开始流行，年轻人宣称“黑色很美丽！”

That same year, HUEY NEWTON AND BOBBY SEALE took Carmichael's advice one step further. They formed the BLACK PANTHER PARTY in Oakland, California. Openly brandishing weapons, the Panthers decided to take control of their own neighborhoods to aid their communities and to resist police brutality. Soon the Panthers spread across the nation. The Black Panther Party borrowed many tenets from socialist movements, including Mao Zedong's famous creed "Political power comes through the barrel of a gun." The Panthers and the police exchanged gunshots on American streets as white Americans viewed the growing militancy with increasing alarm.
同年，休伊·牛顿和鲍比·西尔进一步采纳了卡迈克尔的建议。他们在加利福尼亚州奥克兰成立了"黑豹党"。**黑豹党公开挥舞武器，决定控制自己的社区，以援助自己的社区并抵制警察的暴行。**很快，黑豹队就遍布全国。**黑豹党借鉴了"社会主义运动"的许多信条，包括毛泽东的著名信条“枪杆子里出政权”。**黑豹党和警察在美国街头交锋，美国白人对黑人日益增长的好战情绪, 越来越感到警惕。

== 解说

===  A New Civil Rights Movement


In 1950, the United States operated under an apartheid-like system of legislated white supremacy.

Although the Civil War did bring an official end to slavery in the United States, it did not erase the social barriers built by that "PECULIAR INSTITUTION."

Despite the efforts of RADICAL RECONSTRUCTIONISTS, the American South emerged from the CIVIL WAR with a system of laws that undermined the freedom of African Americans and preserved many elements of white privilege. No major successful attack was launched on the segregation system until the 1950s.



Beginning with the Supreme Court's school integration ruling of 1954, the American legal system seemed sympathetic to African American demands that their FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT CIVIL RIGHTS be protected. Soon, a peaceful equality movement began under the unofficial leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A wave of marches, boycotts, sit-ins, and freedom rides swept the American South and even parts of the North.

Public opinion polls across the nation and the world revealed a great deal of sympathy for African Americans. The Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations gave the Civil Rights Movement at least tacit support. Although many obstacles to complete racial equity remained, by 1965 most legal forms of discrimination had been abolished.


Legal equality did not bring economic equality and social acceptance. Gains made by civil rights activists did not bring greater unity in the movement. On the contrary, as the 1960s progressed, a radical wing of the movement grew stronger and stronger. Influenced by Malcolm X, the Black Power Movement rejected the policy of nonviolence at all costs and even believed integration was not a desirable short-term goal. Black nationalists called for the establishment of a nation of African Americans dependent on each other for support without the interference or help of whites.

Race-related violence began to spread across the country. Beginning in 1964, a series of "long, hot summers" of rioting plagued urban centers. More and more individuals dedicated to African American causes became victims of assassination. Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr. were a few of the more famous casualties of the tempest.

Hope and optimism gave way to alienation and despair as the 1970s began. Many realized that although changing racist laws was actually relatively simple, changing racist attitudes was a much more difficult task.

'''

====  Separate No Longer?



Jim Crow laws existed in several southern states and served to reinforce the white authority that had been lost following Reconstruction. One such law required blacks and whites to drink from separate water fountains.

During the first half of the 20th century, the United States existed as two nations in one.

The Supreme Court ruling in PLESSY V. FERGUSON (1896) decreed that the legislation of two separate societies — one black and one white — was permitted as long as the two were equal.

States across the North and South passed laws creating schools and public facilities for each race. These regulations, known as Jim Crow laws, reestablished white authority after it had diminished during the Reconstruction era. Across the land, blacks and whites dined at separate restaurants, bathed in separate swimming pools, and drank from separate water fountains.


The United States had established an American brand of apartheid.

In the aftermath of World War II, America sought to demonstrate to the world the merit of free democracies over communist dictatorships. But its segregation system exposed fundamental hypocrisy. Change began brewing in the late 1940s. President Harry Truman ordered the end of segregation in the armed services, But the wall built by JIM CROW legislation seemed insurmountable.

The first major battleground was in the schools. It was very clear by mid-century that southern states had expertly enacted separate educational systems. These schools, however, were never equal. The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE (NAACP), led by attorney THURGOOD MARSHALL, sued public schools across the South, insisting that the "SEPARATE BUT EQUAL" CLAUSE had been violated.


In no state where distinct racial education laws existed was there equality in public spending. Teachers in white schools were paid better wages, school buildings for white students were maintained more carefully, and funds for educational materials flowed more liberally into white schools. States normally spent 10 to 20 times on the education of white students as they spent on African American students.

The Supreme Court finally decided to rule on this subject in 1954 in the landmark BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION OF TOPEKA case.

The verdict was unanimous against segregation. "Separate facilities are inherently unequal," read Chief Justice EARL WARREN's opinion. Warren worked tirelessly to achieve a 9-0 ruling. He feared any dissent might provide a legal argument for the forces against integration. The united Supreme Court sent a clear message: schools had to integrate.

Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka
May 17, 1954, saw the Supreme Court — in the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka — rule that segregation of public schools was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that all citizens deserve equal protection under the law.

The North and the border states quickly complied with the ruling, but the Brown decision fell on deaf ears in the South. The Court had stopped short of insisting on immediate integration, instead asking local governments to proceed "with all deliberate speed" in complying.

Ten years after Brown, fewer than ten percent of Southern public schools had integrated. Some areas achieved a zero percent compliance rate. The ruling did not address separate restrooms, bus seats, or hotel rooms, so Jim Crow laws remained intact. But cautious first steps toward an equal society had been taken.

It would take a decade of protest, legislation, and bloodshed before America neared a truer equality.


In 1959, Congress passed the CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, the first such measure since Reconstruction. The law created a permanent civil rights commission to assist black suffrage. The measure had little teeth and proved ineffective, but it paved the way for more powerful legislation in the years to come.



'''


==== The Sit-In Movement


By 1960, the Civil Rights Movement had gained strong momentum. The nonviolent measures employed by Martin Luther King Jr. helped African American activists win supporters across the country and throughout the world.

On February 1, 1960, a new tactic was added to the peaceful activists' strategy. Four African American college students walked up to a whites-only lunch counter at the local WOOLWORTH'S store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked for coffee. When service was refused, the students sat patiently. Despite threats and intimidation, the students sat quietly and waited to be served.

The civil rights sit-in was born.

No one participated in a sit-in of this sort without seriousness of purpose. The instructions were simple: sit quietly and wait to be served. Often the participants would be jeered and threatened by local customers. Sometimes they would be pelted with food or ketchup. Angry onlookers tried to provoke fights that never came. In the event of a physical attack, the student would curl up into a ball on the floor and take the punishment. Any violent reprisal would undermine the spirit of the sit-in. When the local police came to arrest the demonstrators, another line of students would take the vacated seats.




SIT-IN organizers believed that if the violence were only on the part of the white community, the world would see the righteousness of their cause. Before the end of the school year, over 1500 black demonstrators were arrested. But their sacrifice brought results. Slowly, but surely, restaurants throughout the South began to abandon their policies of segregation.

In April 1960, Martin Luther King Jr. sponsored a conference to discuss strategy. Students from the North and the South came together and formed the STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE (SNCC). Early leaders included STOKELY CARMICHAEL and FANNIE LOU HAMER. The CONGRESS ON RACIAL EQUALITY (CORE) was a northern group of students led by JAMES FARMER, which also endorsed direct action. These groups became the grassroots organizers of future sit-ins at lunch counters, wade-ins at segregated swimming pools, and pray-ins at white-only churches.


New ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY ordered federal marshals to protect future freedom rides. Bowing to political and public pressure, the INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION soon banned segregation on interstate travel. Progress was slow indeed, but the wall between the races was gradually being eroded.

'''

==== Gains and Pains


Civil rights activists in the early 1960s teemed with enthusiasm. The courts and the federal government seemed to be on their side, and the movement was winning the battle for public opinion.

As sit-ins and freedom rides spread across the South, African American leaders set a new, ambitious goal: a federal law banning racial discrimination in all public accommodations and in employment. In the summer of 1963, President Kennedy indicated he would support such a measure, and thousands marched on Washington to support the bill.

Blacks and whites sang "WE SHALL OVERCOME" and listened to Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his "I HAVE A DREAM" speech. The Civil Rights Movement seemed on the brink of triumph.

As equality advocates notched more and more successes, the forces against change grew more active as well. Groups such the Ku Klux Klan increased hate crimes.



16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, served as a meeting place for many participants of the civil rights movement. Tragedy struck the church in 1963 when a bomb exploded there, killing four young girls and injuring 22 others.

NAACP leader Medgar Evers was murdered in cold blood that summer in Mississippi as he tried to enter his home.



Many who had looked to JOHN F. KENNEDY as a sympathetic leader were crushed when he fell victim to assassination in November 1963. But Kennedy's death did not derail the Civil Rights Act.

PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON signed the bill into law in July 1964. As of that day, it became illegal to refuse employment to an individual on the basis of race. Segregation at any public facility in America was now against the law.



The passage of that act led to a new focus. Many African Americans had been robbed of the right to vote since southern states enacted discriminatory poll taxes and literacy tests. Only five percent of African Americans eligible to vote were registered in Mississippi in 1965. The 24TH AMENDMENT banned the POLL TAX in 1964. A new landmark law, the VOTING RIGHTS ACT of 1965, banned the literacy test and other such measures designed to keep blacks from voting. It also placed federal registrars in the South to ensure black suffrage. By 1965, few legal barriers to racial equality remained.

But centuries of racism could not be erased with the pen. Many African Americans continued to languish in the bottom economic strata. Civil rights activists fought on to achieve economic as well as legal equality. It is a fight that continues to this day.

In the words of Martin Luther King Jr.:

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.

==== Martin Luther King Jr.


As the unquestioned leader of the peaceful Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. was at the same time one of the most beloved and one of the most hated men of his time. From his involvement in the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 until his untimely death in 1968, King's message of change through peaceful means added to the movement's numbers and gave it its moral strength. The legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. is embodied in these two simple words: equality and nonviolence.

King was raised in an activist family. His father was deeply influenced by MARCUS GARVEY's BACK TO AFRICA MOVEMENT in the 1920s. His mother was the daughter of one of Atlanta's most influential African American ministers.



After his organization of the bus boycott, King formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which dedicated itself to the advancement of rights for African Americans. In April 1963, King organized a protest in Birmingham, Alabama, a city King called "the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States." Since the end of World War II, there had been 60 unsolved bombings of African American churches and homes.

Boycotts, sit-ins and marches were conducted. When Bull Connor, head of the Birmingham police department, used fire hoses and dogs on the demonstrators, millions saw the images on television. King was arrested. But support came from around the nation and the world for King and his family. Later in 1963, he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech to thousands in Washington, D.C.

Selma to Montgomery

In March 1965, Dr. King led protestors on a 50-mile, voting-rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. It took three attempts for the protestors to complete the march, battling tear gas, cattle prods, and police batons, but the national attention drawn by their efforts ultimately led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, King turned his efforts to registering African American voters in the South. In 1965, he led a march in Selma, Alabama, to increase the percentage of African American voters in Alabama. Again, King was arrested. Again, the marchers faced attacks by the police. Tear gas, cattle prods, and billy clubs fell on the peaceful demonstrators. Public opinion weighed predominantly on the side of King and the protesters. Finally, President Johnson ordered the National Guard to protect the demonstrators from attack, and King was able to complete the long march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery. The action in Selma led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Early in the morning of April 4, 1968, King was shot by JAMES EARL RAY. Spontaneous violence spread through urban areas as mourners unleashed their rage at the loss of their leader. Rioting burst forth in many American cities.

But the world never forgot his contributions. Time magazine had named him "Man of the Year" in 1963. In 1964, he won the Nobel Peace Prize and was described as "the first person in the Western world to have shown us that a struggle can be waged without violence." In 1977, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award a civilian American can earn. In the 1980s, his birthday became a national holiday, creating an annual opportunity for Americans to reflect on the two values he dedicated his life to advancing: equality and nonviolence.

==== Black Power

Despite legislative gains against discriminatory policies, America was moving toward two distinct societies divided along racial lines.

As the great migration of blacks from the South to northern cities continued, white northerners began deserting the cities for the suburbs.

African Americans had been victimized by poor education, the unavailability of quality employment, slum conditions, and police brutality. The average income of a black household was only slightly more than half the income of its white counterpart. The Kerner Commission recommended a wide array of social spending programs, including housing programs, job training, and welfare. Civil rights legislation became the cornerstone of Lyndon Johnson's GREAT SOCIETY PROGRAM.


As Martin Luther King preached his gospel of peaceful change and integration in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Malcolm X delivered a different message: whites were not to be trusted. He called on African Americans to be proud of their heritage and to set up strong communities without the help of white Americans. He promoted the establishment of a separate state for African Americans in which they could rely on themselves to provide solutions to their own problems. Violence was not the only answer, but violence was justified in self-defense. Blacks should achieve what was rightfully theirs "by any means necessary."

As Malcolm X led a mass rally in Harlem on February 21, 1965, rival Black Muslims gunned him down.

Although his life was ended, the ideas he preached lived on in the Black Power Movement.



Carmichael and McKissick were heavily influenced by the words of Malcolm X, and rejected integration as a short-term goal. Carmichael felt that blacks needed to feel a sense of racial pride and self-respect before any meaningful gains could be achieved. He encouraged the strengthening of African American communities without the help of whites.
