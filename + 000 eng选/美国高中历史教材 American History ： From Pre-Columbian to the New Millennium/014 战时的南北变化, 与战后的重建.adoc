== The War Behind the Lines 战线后方的战争 (领导者比拼, 和经济动员)

Modern wars are not confined to the battlefield. Americans in the North and South contributed to the war effort unlike civilians of any previous conflict. The political leaders in the Union and Confederacy each had battles of their own to wage. The Civil War would also require a complete revolution in the economies of both regions. The results of such changes would not only determine the outcome of the war, but would utterly transform the new nation politically, socially, and economically.
现代战争不仅仅局限于战场。与以往任何冲突中的平民不同，南北双方的美国人, 为战争做出了贡献。联邦和邦联的政治领导人, 各自都有自己的斗争要进行。内战还需要这两个地区的经济发生彻底的革命。这些变化的结果不仅会决定战争的结果，而且会在政治、社会和经济上, 彻底改变这个新国家。

In the North, President Lincoln had been elected by a minority of voters in his first election and had to continually battle to win reelection. COPPERHEADS, also known as "Peace" Democrats repeatedly thwarted the President's leadership initiatives. In the South, Jefferson Davis was in no easier position. How could a government formed on the basis of states' rights provide the strong, centralized leadership necessary to prevail in war? Davis constantly had to fight with individuals and state legislatures for the power he needed to run the Confederate government.
**在北方，林肯总统在第一次选举中, 以少数选民的身份当选，必须不断争取连任。铜头党，也被称为“和平”民主党人，多次阻挠总统的领导举措。在南方，杰斐逊·戴维斯的处境也并不轻松。**一个建立在国家权利基础上的政府, 如何能够提供在战争中取胜所必需的强有力的、集中的领导呢？*戴维斯不断地与个人和州立法机构争, 夺管理"邦联政府"所需的权力。*


One of the most important challenges for each leader was foreign relations. If the South could get Britain to support the Confederacy, then maybe, with the most powerful navy in the world, the British could break the Union blockade of Southern ports. This would provide the South with large markets for its cotton and perhaps a source of money large enough to finance the war. Lincoln's job, of course, was to prevent this at all costs. A great game of diplomacy was under way.
**对于每位领导人来说，最重要的挑战之一是外交关系。如果南方能够让英国支持南方邦联，那么英国也许可以凭借世界上最强大的海军, 打破"北方联邦"对南方港口的封锁。这将为南方提供巨大的棉花市场，或许还有足够的资金来源来资助战争。当然，林肯的工作就是不惜一切代价阻止这种情况发生。**一场伟大的外交游戏正在进行中。

As the war progressed, a stark contrast between the two economies emerged. Both the North and the South experienced high rates of inflation, but the South's rate was 80 times greater than in the North. Labor shortages occurred on both sides, as did increasing class conflict between the wealthy and the poor. Since most of the battles in the Civil War took place in the South, great physical destruction was wrought throughout the region, causing mass poverty and despair.
*随着战争的进展，两个经济体之间, 出现了鲜明的对比。北方和南方都经历了高通货膨胀率，但南方的通货膨胀率是北方的80倍。双方都出现了劳动力短缺，贫富之间的阶级冲突也日益加剧。由于内战中的大部分战斗发生在南方，整个南方地区遭受了巨大的物质破坏，造成了大规模的贫困和绝望。*

The war also brought significant new roles for Northern and Southern women at home and at work as they replaced almost two million men going off to war. They plowed the fields and did jobs previously done only by the men. Through organization and sheer tenacity they broadened their influence on many problems facing society.
*战争还为北方和南方女性, 在家庭和工作中, 带来了重要的新角色，她们取代了近两百万奔赴战场的男性。她们耕田并做以前只有男人才能做的工作*。通过组织和顽强的毅力，她们扩大了对社会面临的许多问题的影响力。



Men were military nurses before this time. It was not considered proper for women to tend to injured and dying men, assisting in operations and care. In fighting for this right, women earned respect and admiration of generals, politicians, and husbands. They would use this success to continue to enlarge their role in the evolving fabric of the nation.
在此之前，军队中的护士是男性担当的。人们认为妇女照顾受伤和垂死的男子、协助手术和护理是不合适的。在争取这一权利的过程中，妇女赢得了将军、政治家和丈夫的尊重和钦佩。他们将利用这一成功, 继续扩大他们在不断发展的国家结构中的作用。

The Civil War presents a struggle between two societies, not merely two armies. It showed how a predominantly industrial society could prevail over an agricultural one. It demonstrated like no previous war that the efforts of all individuals matter. Lastly, although he would not live to see the results, the handling of the Civil War is a testament to the wisdom, determination and leadership of Abraham Lincoln, arguably America's greatest President.
**内战展现了两个社会之间的斗争，而不仅仅是两支军队之间的斗争。它展示了一个以工业为主的社会, 如何战胜农业社会。**与以往任何一场战争不同，它证明了所有人的努力都很重要。最后，尽管他(林肯)无法活着看到结果，但内战的处理, 证明了亚伯拉罕·林肯（可以说是美国最伟大的总统）的智慧、决心和领导力。

====  The Emancipation Proclamation 解放奴隶宣言


Americans tend to think of the Civil War as being fought to end slavery. Even one full year into the Civil War, the elimination of slavery was not a key objective of the North. Despite a vocal Abolitionist movement in the North, many people and many soldiers, in particular, opposed slavery, but did not favor emancipation. They expected slavery to die on its own over time.
**美国人倾向于认为, 内战是为了结束"奴隶制"而进行的。即使内战已经过去一年，消除奴隶制也不是北方的主要目标。**尽管北方的废奴运动声势浩大，但许多人民，特别是许多士兵反对奴隶制，但不赞成解放奴隶。他们预计奴隶制会随着时间的推移而自行消亡。



By mid-1862 Lincoln had come to believe in the need to end slavery. Besides his disdain for the institution, he simply felt that the South could not come back into the Union after trying to destroy it. The opposition Democratic Party threatened to turn itself into an antiwar party. Lincoln's military commander, General George McClellan, was vehemently against emancipation. Many Republicans who backed policies that forbid black settlement in their states were against granting blacks additional rights. When Lincoln indicated he wanted to issue a proclamation of freedom to his cabinet in mid-1862, they convinced him he had to wait until the Union achieved a significant military success.
到1862年中期，林肯开始相信终结奴隶制的必要性。除了他对这个制度的蔑视之外，他只是觉得，南方在试图摧毁联邦之后，不可能再回到联邦中来。反对党民主党, 威胁要把自己变成一个反战政党。林肯的军事指挥官乔治·麦克莱伦将军, 强烈反对解放黑奴。许多支持禁止黑人在他们的州定居的政策的共和党人, 反对给予黑人额外的权利。当林肯在1862年中期表示, 他想向他的内阁发表一份自由宣言时，他们说服他，他必须等到联邦取得重大军事胜利之后再做.



That victory came in September at Antietam. No foreign country wants to ally with a potential losing power. By achieving victory, the Union demonstrated to the British that the South may lose. As a result, the British did not recognize the Confederate States of America, and Antietam became one of the war's most important diplomatic battles, as well as one of the bloodiest. Five days after the battle, Lincoln decided to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, effective January 1, 1863. Unless the Confederate States returned to the Union by that day, he proclaimed their slaves "shall be then, thenceforward and forever free."
这场胜利, 于九月在安提坦取得。没有哪个国家愿意与潜在的失败国家结盟。通过取得胜利，联邦向英国人表明南方可能会失败。结果，英国不承认南方的美利坚联盟国，安提特姆战役成为战争中最重要的外交战役之一，也是最血腥的战役之一。战役结束五天后，林肯决定发布《解放奴隶宣言》，于 1863 年 1 月 1 日生效。除非南部邦联各州在那一天回归联邦，否则他宣布他们的奴隶“届时、从此以后将永远获得自由”。

It is sometimes said that the Emancipation Proclamation freed no slaves. In a way, this is true. The proclamation would only apply to the Confederate States, as an act to seize enemy resources. By freeing slaves in the Confederacy, Lincoln was actually freeing people he did not directly control. The way he explained the Proclamation made it acceptable to much of the Union army. He emphasized emancipation as a way to shorten the war by taking Southern resources and hence reducing Confederate strength. Even McClellan supported the policy as a soldier. Lincoln made no such offer of freedom to the border states.
有时有人说《解放奴隶宣言》没有解放奴隶。在某种程度上，这是真的。该宣言只适用于南方邦联，作为夺取敌人资源的行动。通过解放邦联的奴隶，林肯实际上解放了他没有直接控制的人。他解释《宣言》的方式，使大部分联邦军队都能接受。他强调解放奴隶是一种"缩短战争的方式，利用南方的资源，从而削弱邦联"的力量。甚至麦克莱伦在当兵时, 也支持这项政策。林肯没有向边境各州提供这样的自由。

The Emancipation Proclamation created a climate where the doom of slavery was seen as one of the major objectives of the war. Overseas, the North now seemed to have the greatest moral cause. Even if a foreign government wanted to intervene on behalf of the South, its population might object. The Proclamation itself freed very few slaves, but it was the death knell for slavery in the United States. Eventually, the Emancipation Proclamation led to the proposal and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which formally abolished slavery throughout the land.
*《解放奴隶宣言》创造了一种氛围，在这种氛围中，奴隶制的灭亡, 被视为战争的主要目标之一。在海外，北方现在似乎拥有最伟大的道德事业。即使外国政府想要代表南方进行干预，其人民也可能会反对。*《宣言》本身释放的奴隶很少，但它为美国的奴隶制敲响了丧钟。*最终，《解放奴隶宣言》导致了宪法第十三修正案的提出和批准，正式废除了整个土地上的奴隶制。*

==== Wartime Diplomacy 战时外交

Rebellions rarely succeed without foreign support. The North and South both sought British and French support. Jefferson Davis was determined to secure such an alliance with Britain or France for the Confederacy. Abraham Lincoln knew this could not be permitted. A great chess match was about to begin.
**没有外国的支持，叛乱很少能成功。南北双方都寻求英国和法国的支持。杰斐逊·戴维斯决心为邦联与英国或法国, 建立这样的联盟。亚伯拉罕·林肯知道, 不能允许南方实现这一点。**一场伟大的国际象棋比赛即将开始。

Cotton was a formidable weapon in Southern diplomacy. Europe was reliant on cotton grown in the South for their textile industry. Over 75% of the cotton used by British came from states within the Confederacy.
棉花是南方外交中的强大武器。欧洲的纺织业依赖南方种植的棉花。英国使用的棉花 75% 以上, 都来自南部邦联内的各州。

By 1863, the Union blockade reduced British cotton imports to 3% of their pre-war levels. Throughout Europe there was a "COTTON FAMINE." There was also a great deal of money being made by British shipbuilders. The South needed fast ships to run the blockade, which British shipbuilders were more than happy to furnish.
到 1863 年，北方联盟的封锁, 使英国棉花进口量减少至战前水平的 3%。整个欧洲出现了一场“棉花饥荒”。英国造船商也赚了很多钱。南方需要航行快速的船只, 来突破封锁，而英国造船商非常乐意提供这些船只。



France had reasons to support the South. NAPOLEON III saw an opportunity to get cotton and to restore a French presence in America, especially in Mexico, by forging an alliance.
法国有理由支持南方。拿破仑三世看到了一个获得棉花的机会，并通过结盟来恢复法国在美洲，特别是在墨西哥的存在。

But the North also had cards to play. Crop failures in Europe in the early years of the war increased British dependency on Union wheat. In 1862, over one-half of British grain imports came from the Union. The growth of other British industries such as the iron and shipbuilding offset the decline in the textile industry. British merchant vessels were also carrying much of the trade between the Union and Great Britain, providing another source of income.
但北方也有牌可打。战争初期, 欧洲的农作物歉收, 增加了英国对美国北方联盟小麦的依赖。 1862 年，英国一半以上的谷物进口, 来自美国北方联邦。英国其他工业如钢铁和造船业的增长, 抵消了纺织业的下滑。英国商船还承载着联邦和英国之间的大部分贸易，提供了另一个收入来源。



The greatest problem for the South lay in its embrace of slavery, as the British took pride in their leadership of ending the trans-Atlantic slave trade. To support a nation that had openly embraced slavery now seemed unthinkable. After the Emancipation Proclamation, Britain was much less prepared to intervene on behalf of the South.
*南方最大的问题在于其对奴隶制的拥护，因为英国人为自己在结束跨大西洋奴隶贸易方面的领导地位, 而感到自豪。现在去支持一个公开接受奴隶制的国家, 似乎是不可想象的。 因此在《解放奴隶宣言》颁布后，英国不太愿意代表南方来进行干预。*

The key for each side was to convince Europe that victory for its side was inevitable. Early Southern victories convinced Britain that the North couldn't triumph against a foe so large and so opposed to domination. This was a lesson reminiscent of the one learned by the British themselves in the Revolutionary War. Yet, despite all its victories, the South never struck a decisive blow to the North. The British felt they must know that the South's independence was certain before recognizing the Confederacy. The Southern loss at Antietam loomed large in the minds of European diplomats.
*双方的关键是, 让欧洲相信其自己一方的胜利是不可避免的。南方早期的胜利, 让英国相信，北方无法战胜如此庞大、如此反对统治的敌人。这让人想起英国人自己在独立战争中得到的教训。然而，尽管取得了种种胜利，南方却从未能对北方造成决定性的打击。英国人认为，在承认南方邦联之前，他们必须知道南方的独立是确定无疑的。而南方在安提特姆的失败, 给欧洲外交官留下了深刻的印象(不看好南方的阴影)。*

Yet efforts did not stop. Lincoln, his SECRETARY OF STATE WILLIAM SEWARD, and AMBASSADOR CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS labored tirelessly to maintain British neutrality. As late as 1864, Jefferson Davis proposed to release slaves in the South if Britain would recognize the Confederacy.
*然而努力并没有停止。林肯、他的国务卿威廉·苏厄德, 和大使查尔斯·弗朗西斯·亚当斯, 孜孜不倦地努力维持英国的中立。迟至 1864 年，南方的总统杰斐逊·戴维斯 (Jefferson Davis) 提议，如果英国承认南部邦联，就释放南方的奴隶。*

==== 战时, 北方的社会变化

After initial setbacks, most Northern civilians experienced an explosion of WARTIME PRODUCTION.
经过最初的挫折后，大多数北方平民, 经历了战时生产的爆炸式增长。

During the war, coal and iron production reached their highest levels. Merchant ship tonnage peaked. Traffic on the railroads and the Erie Canal rose over 50%.
战争期间，煤炭和铁产量达到最高水平。商船吨位达到顶峰。铁路和伊利运河的交通量增长了 50% 以上。

Union manufacturers grew so profitable that many companies doubled or tripled their dividends to stockholders. The newly rich built lavish homes and spent their money extravagantly on carriages, silk clothing and jewelry. There was a great deal of public outrage that such conduct was unbecoming or even immoral in time of war. What made this lifestyle even more offensive was that workers' salaries shrank in real terms due to inflation. The price of beef, rice and sugar doubled from their pre-war levels, yet salaries rose only half as fast as prices — while companies of all kinds made record profits.
北方联邦领土上, 制造商的利润增长如此之快，以至于许多公司向股东发放的股息, 增加了一倍或三倍。新富们建造了豪华的住宅，并挥霍金钱购买马车、丝绸服装和珠宝。这种行为在战时是不恰当的，甚至是不道德的，引起了公众的极大愤慨。让这种生活方式更令人反感的是，**工人的实际工资因通货膨胀而缩水。**牛肉、大米和糖的价格比战前水平翻了一番，但工资上涨速度, 仅为物价上涨速度的一半，而各类公司的利润却创下了纪录。



Women's roles changed dramatically during the war. Before the war, women of the North already had been prominent in a number of industries, including textiles, clothing and shoe-making. With the conflict, there were great increases in employment of women in occupations ranging from government civil service to agricultural field work. As men entered the Union army, women's proportion of the manufacturing work force went from one-fourth to one-third. At home, women organized over one thousand soldiers' aid societies, rolled bandages for use in hospitals and raised millions of dollars to aid injured troops.
战争期间，妇女的角色发生了巨大变化。战前，北方妇女已在纺织、服装和制鞋等多个行业, 占据重要地位。由于战争需要，从政府公务员, 到农业田间工作等各种职业的妇女就业人数, 大幅增加。**随着男性加入联邦军队，女性在制造业劳动力中的比例从四分之一上升到三分之一。**在家里，妇女们组织了一千多个士兵援助协会，卷起绷带供医院使用，并筹集了数百万美元, 来援助受伤的士兵。

Nowhere was their impact felt greater than in field hospitals close to the front. Dorothea Dix, who led the effort to provide state hospitals for the mentally ill, was named the first superintendent of women nurses and set rigid guidelines. CLARA BARTON, working in a patent office, became one of the most admired nurses during the war and, as a result of her experiences, formed the AMERICAN RED CROSS.
没有什么地方, 比靠近前线的野战医院, 更能感受到他们的影响。多萝西娅·迪克斯 (Dorothea Dix) 领导了"为精神病患者提供州立医院"的运动，她被任命为第一位女护士主管，并制定了严格的指导方针。在专利局工作的克拉拉·巴顿 (CLARA BARTON) , 成为战争期间最受尊敬的护士之一，并凭借她的经历, 组建了"美国红十字会"。


Resentment of the draft was another divisive issue. In the middle of 1862, Lincoln called for 300,000 volunteer soldiers. Each state was given a quota, and if it could not meet the quota, it had no recourse but to DRAFT men into the state militia. Resistance was so great in some parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana that the army had to send in troops to keep order. Tempers flared further over the provision that allowed exemptions for those who could afford to hire a substitute.
对征兵的不满, 是另一个引起分歧的问题。1862年中期，林肯征召了30万名志愿兵。每个州都有配额，如果达不到配额，就只能征召男子加入"州民兵"。在宾夕法尼亚州、俄亥俄州、威斯康辛州, 和印第安纳州的一些地区，抵抗力量非常强大，军队不得不派遣军人维持秩序。对于"允许有能力聘请替代人员的人, 能享有'服兵役'豁免权"的条款，人们的愤怒进一步加剧。

In 1863, facing a serious loss of manpower through casualties and expiration of enlistments, Congress authorized the government to enforce CONSCRIPTION, resulting in riots in several states. In July 1863, when draft offices were established in New York to bring new Irish workers into the military, mobs formed to resist. At least 74 people were killed over three days. The same troops that had just triumphantly defeated Lee at Gettysburg were deployed to maintain order in New York City.
1863年，面对严重的人力损失，由于伤亡和征兵到期，"国会"授权"政府"强制征兵，导致几个州发生骚乱。1863年7月，当纽约成立征兵办公室，将新的爱尔兰工人纳入军队时，暴民们开始反抗。三天内至少有74人丧生。刚刚在葛底斯堡击败李将军的这支部队, 就被部署到纽约来维持秩序。


'''


==== 战时, 南方的社会变化

After the initial months of the war, the South was plagued with shortages of all kinds. It started with clothing. As the first winter of the war approached, the Confederate army needed wool clothing to keep their soldiers warm. But the South did not produce much wool and the Northern blockade prevented much wool from being imported from abroad. People all over the South donated their woolens to the cause. Soon families at home were cutting blankets out of carpets.
战争最初几个月后，南方饱受各种物资短缺的困扰。一切从服装开始。随着战争第一个冬天的临近，南方联盟军队需要羊毛服装来为士兵保暖。但南方生产的羊毛并不多，北方的封锁也阻止了从国外进口大量羊毛。南方各地的人们都为这项事业捐赠了羊毛。很快，家里的家人就开始用地毯剪出毯子。

Almost all the shoes worn in the South were manufactured in the North. With the start of the war, shipments of shoes ceased and there would be few new shoes available for years. The first meeting of Confederate and Union forces at Gettysburg arose when Confederates were investigating a supply of shoes in a warehouse.
南方几乎所有的鞋子都是在北方制造的。随着战争的爆发，鞋子的运输停止了，接下来几年将几乎没有新鞋可用。在葛底斯堡，邦联军队和北方军队的第一次会面, 就是在南方邦联军队调查一个仓库里的鞋子供应时发生的。


Money was another problem. The South's decision to print more money to pay for the war simply led to unbelievable increases in price of everyday items. By the end of 1861, the overall rate of inflation was running 12% per month. For example, salt was the only means to preserve meat at this time. Its price increased from 65¢ for a 200 pound bag in May 1861 to $60 per sack only 18 months later. Wheat, flour, corn meal, meats of all kinds, iron, tin and copper became too expensive for the ordinary family. PROFITEERS frequently bought up all the goods in a store to sell them back at a higher price. It was an unmanageable situation. FOOD RIOTS occurred in Mobile, Atlanta and Richmond. Over the course of the war, inflation in the South caused prices to rise by 9000%.
钱是另一个问题。南方决定印更多的钱来支付战争费用，这导致了日常用品价格难以置信的上涨。到 1861 年底，总体通货膨胀率达到每月 12%。例如，**盐是当时保存肉类的唯一手段。**其价格从 1861 年 5 月每袋 200 磅的 65 美分, 上涨到仅 18 个月后每袋 60 美元。小麦、面粉、玉米粉、各种肉类、铁、锡和铜, 对于普通家庭来说变得过于昂贵。**奸商经常买下商店里的所有商品，然后以更高的价格出售。**这是一个难以控制的情况。莫比尔、亚特兰大和里士满发生食品骚乱。*战争期间，南方的通货膨胀, 导致物价上涨了 9000%。*



Women's roles changed dramatically. The absence of men meant that women were now heads of households. Women staffed the Confederate government as clerks and became schoolteachers for the first time. Women at first were denied permission to work in military hospitals as they were exposed to "sights that no lady should see." But when casualties rose to the point that wounded men would die in the streets due to lack of attention, female nurses such as SALLY LOUISA TOMPKINS and KATE CUMMING would not be denied. Indeed, by late 1862, the Confederate Congress enacted a law permitting civilians in military hospitals, giving preference to women.
女性的角色发生了巨大的变化。男性的缺席, 意味着女性现在成为了一家之主。女性在南部邦联政府担任文员，并首次成为学校教师。妇女最初被拒绝在军队医院工作，因为她们会暴露在“任何女士不应该看到的景象”。但当伤亡人数上升到"伤员因缺乏照护而死在街头"时，莎莉·路易莎·汤普金斯, 和凯特·卡明这样的女护士工作, 就不会再被拒绝了。事实上，到 1862 年底，南方联盟国会颁布了一项法律，允许平民进入军队医院，并优先考虑女性。



The most unpopular act of the Confederate government was the institution of a draft. Loopholes permitted a drafted man to hire a substitute, leading many wealthy men to avoid service. When the Confederate Congress exempted anyone who supervised 20 slaves, dissension exploded. Many started to conclude that it was "A RICH MAN'S WAR AND A POOR MAN'S FIGHT." This sentiment and the suffering of their families led many to desert the Confederate armies.
邦联政府中最不受欢迎的行为, 是制定征兵制度。制度漏洞"允许应征入伍的人, 来雇用替代者为他们服兵役"，这导致许多富有的人能避免服军役。当南方"国会"豁免任何监管20名奴隶的人时，不满情绪激增。*许多人开始得出结论，这是一场“本是富人发动的战争，却让穷人去战斗。”这种情绪以及家庭的苦难, 导致许多人背弃了南方军队。*

By November 1863, JAMES SEDDON, the Confederate Secretary of War said he could not account for 1/3 of the army. After the fall of Atlanta, soldiers worried more about their families then staying to fight for their new country. Much of the Confederate army started home to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.
到 1863 年 11 月，南方邦联战争部长詹姆斯·塞登 (JAMES SEDDON) 表示，他无法掌控住 1/3 的军队的行动。亚特兰大陷落后，士兵们更多地担心他们的家人，而不是留下来为他们的新国家而战。大部分南方联盟军队开始回家,收拾他们支离破碎的生活。

== The Election of 1864  .  1864 年的选举

It is hard for modern Americans to believe that Abraham Lincoln, one of history's most beloved Presidents, was nearly defeated in his reelection attempt in 1864. Yet by that summer, Lincoln himself feared he would lose. How could this happen? First, the country had not elected an incumbent President for a second term since Andrew Jackson in 1832 — nine Presidents in a row had served just one term. Also, his embrace of emancipation was still a problem for many Northern voters.
**现代美国人很难相信, 历史上最受爱戴的总统之一亚伯拉罕·林肯 (Abraham Lincoln) , 在 1864 年的连任尝试中差点被击败。**然而到了那个夏天，林肯本人担心自己会失败。怎么会发生这种事？首先，自 1832 年安德鲁·杰克逊以来，该国还没有选出过连任的现任总统 ——连续九位总统都只担任过一个任期。此外，他对解放奴隶的拥护, 仍然是许多北方选民会关心的一个问题。

Despite Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg a year earlier, the Southern armies came back fighting with a vengeance. During three months in the summer of 1864, over 65,000 Union soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing-in-action. In comparison, there had been 108,000 Union casualties in the first three years. General Ulysses S. Grant was being called The Butcher. At one time during the summer, Confederate soldiers under JUBAL EARLY came within five miles of the White House.
尽管联邦军一年前, 在葛底斯堡, 和维克斯堡取得了胜利，但南方军队却卷土重来。 1864 年夏天的三个月里，超过 65,000 名联邦士兵, 在军事行动中阵亡、受伤或失踪。相比之下，前三年联盟伤亡人数为 108,000 人。尤利西斯·S·格兰特将军被称为“屠夫”。夏天的某个时候，朱巴尔·厄尔利 (JUBAL EARLY) 率领的南方联盟士兵, 甚至来到了距白宫不到五英里的地方。



Lincoln had much to contend with. He had staunch opponents in the Congress. Underground Confederate activities brought rebellion to parts of Maryland. Lincoln's suspension of the WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS was ruled unconstitutional by Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney — an order Lincoln refused to obey. But worst of all, the war was not going well.
**林肯有很多事情要应对。他在国会中有坚定的反对者。**南方邦联在地下的秘密活动, 给马里兰州部分地区带来了叛乱。最高法院首席法官罗杰·B·塔尼, 裁定林肯暂停人身保护令违宪，但林肯拒绝遵守这一命令。但最糟糕的是，战争进展并不顺利。


Meanwhile the DEMOCRATIC PARTY SPLIT, with major opposition from Peace Democrats, who wanted a negotiated peace at any cost. They chose as their nominee George B. McClellan, Lincoln's former commander of the Army of the Potomac. Even Lincoln expected that McClellan would win.
与此同时，民主党处在分裂中，主要反对派是和平民主党人，他们希望不惜一切代价, 通过谈判(而不是军事胜利)来实现和平。他们选择了林肯的前波托马克军团指挥官"乔治·麦克莱伦"（George B. McClellan）作为提名人。就连林肯也预计麦克莱伦会获胜。

The South was well aware of Union discontent. Many felt that if the Southern armies could hold out until the election, negotiations for Northern recognition of Confederate independence might begin.
**南方很清楚北方联邦内部的不满。许多人认为，如果南方军队能够坚持到北方大选，"北方承认南部邦联独立"的谈判, 可能就会展开。**

Everything changed on September 6, 1864, when General Sherman seized Atlanta. The war effort had turned decidedly in the North's favor and even McClellan now sought military victory.
1864 年 9 月 6 日，当谢尔曼将军占领亚特兰大时，一切都发生了变化。战争的努力显然对北方有利，甚至麦克莱伦现在也寻求军事胜利。

Two months later, Lincoln won the popular vote that eluded him in his first election. He won the electoral college by 212 to 21 and the Republicans had won three-fourths of Congress. A second term and the power to conclude the war were now in his hands.
两个月后，林肯赢得了他在第一次选举中未能获得的民众选票。他以 212 比 21 赢得选举团，共和党赢得了国会四分之三的席位。第二任期的赢得, 和结束战争的权力, 现在掌握在他的手中。

==  Reconstruction 重建 -- "黑人奴隶新权利"的反复

RECONSTRUCTION refers to the period following the Civil War of rebuilding the United States. It was a time of great pain and endless questions. On what terms would the Confederacy be allowed back into the Union? Who would establish the terms, Congress or the President? What was to be the place of freed blacks in the South? Did Abolition mean that black men would now enjoy the same status as white men? What was to be done with the Confederate leaders, who were seen as traitors by many in the North?
"重建"是指内战后重建美国的时期。那是一段充满巨大痛苦和无尽疑问的时期。邦联在什么条件下才能重返联邦？谁来制定条款，是国会还是总统？南方被解放的黑人应该去哪里？废奴是否意味着"黑人现在将享有与白人同等的地位"？被许多北方人视为叛徒的南方邦联领导人, 现在该怎么处理？

Although the military conflict had ended, Reconstruction was in many ways still a war. This important struggle was waged by radical northerners who wanted to punish the South and Southerners who desperately wanted to preserve their way of life.
尽管军事冲突已经结束，但"重建"在很多方面仍然是一场战争。这场重要的斗争, 是由激进的北方人发起的，他们想要惩罚南方人和迫切希望保留自己生活方式的南方人。



Slavery, in practical terms, died with the end of the Civil War. Three Constitutional amendments altered the nature of African-American rights. The THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT formally abolished slavery in all states and territories. The FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT prohibited states from depriving any male citizen of equal protection under the law, regardless of race. The FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT granted the right to vote to African-American males. Ratification of these amendments became a requirement for Southern states to be readmitted into the Union. Although these measures were positive steps toward racial equality, their enforcement proved extremely difficult.
实际上，**奴隶制随着内战的结束而消亡。三项宪法修正案, 改变了非裔美国人权利的性质。第十三修正案, 正式废除了所有州和领地的奴隶制。第十四修正案, 禁止各州剥夺任何男性公民依法享有的平等保护，无论其种族如何。第十五修正案, 赋予非裔美国男性投票权。批准这些修正案, 成为南方各州重新加入联邦的必要条件。**尽管这些措施是实现种族平等的积极步骤，但事实证明它们的执行极其困难。

The period of PRESIDENTIAL RECONSTRUCTION lasted from 1865 to 1867. Andrew Johnson, as Lincoln's successor, proposed a very lenient policy toward the South. He pardoned most Southern whites, appointed provisional governors and outlined steps for the creation of new state governments. Johnson felt that each state government could best decide how they wanted blacks to be treated. Many in the North were infuriated that the South would be returning their former Confederate leaders to power. They were also alarmed by Southern adoption of Black Codes that sought to maintain white supremacy. Recently freed blacks found the postwar South very similar to the prewar South.
"总统重建"时期, 从1865年, 持续到1867年。安德鲁·约翰逊作为林肯的继任者，提出了对南方非常宽松的政策。他赦免了大多数南方白人，任命了临时州长，并概述了创建新"州政府"的步骤。约翰逊认为，每个州政府, 最好可以决定他们希望黑人受到怎样的对待。许多北方人对"南方将让他们的前南方邦联领导人, 来重新掌权",而感到愤怒。他们还对"南方采用旨在维护白人至上的黑人法典", 而感到震惊。最近**获得自由的黑人发现, 战后的南方, 与战前的南方非常相似。**



The CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS OF 1866 brought RADICAL REPUBLICANS to power. They wanted to punish the South, and to prevent the ruling class from continuing in power. They passed the MILITARY RECONSTRUCTION ACTS OF 1867, which divided the South into five military districts and outlined how the new governments would be designed. Under federal bayonets, blacks, including those who had recently been freed, received the right to vote, hold political offices, and become judges and police chiefs. They held positions that formerly belonged to Southern Democrats. Many in the South were aghast. President Johnson vetoed all the Radical initiatives, but Congress overrode him each time. It was the Radical Republicans who impeached President Johnson in 1868. The Senate, by a single vote, failed to convict him, but his power to hinder radical reform was diminished.
1**866 年的国会选举, 让激进派共和党人上台。他们想要惩罚南方，并阻止"南方原来的统治阶级"继续掌权。**他们通过了 1867 年军事重建法案，将南方划分为五个军区，并概述了新政府的设计方式。在联邦的刺刀下，黑人，包括最近获得自由的黑人，都获得了投票权、担任政治职务、成为法官和警察局长的权利。他们担任的职位, 以前属于南方民主党。许多南方人都惊呆了。*约翰逊总统否决了所有激进倡议，但国会也每次都否决了他。* 1868年弹劾约翰逊总统的, 是激进共和党人。参议院以一票之差, 未能对他定罪，但他阻碍激进改革的权力, 却被削弱了。

Not all supported the Radical Republicans. Many Southern whites could not accept the idea that former slaves could not only vote but hold office. It was in this era that the Ku Klux Klan was born. A reign of terror was aimed both at local Republican leaders as well as at blacks seeking to assert their new political rights. Beatings, lynchings, and massacres, were all in a night's work for the clandestine Klan. Unable to protect themselves, Southern blacks and Republicans looked to Washington for protection. After ten years, Congress and the radicals grew weary of federal involvement in the South. The WITHDRAWAL OF UNION TROOPS IN 1877 brought renewed attempts to strip African-Americans of their newly acquired rights.
并非所有人都支持激进的共和党人。许多南方白人不能接受"前奴隶不仅可以投票，而且可以担任公职"的想法。三k党就是在这个时代诞生的。他们的恐怖行动, 既针对当地的共和党领导人，也针对寻求"维护其新政治权利"的黑人。殴打、私刑和屠杀，都是秘密的三k党一夜之间的勾当。由于无法保护自己，南方黑人和共和党人, 向华盛顿政府寻求保护。十年后，国会和激进派, 对联邦介入南方感到厌倦。 1877 年联邦军队的撤出, 引发了南方"剥夺非裔美国人新近获得的权利"的新尝试。

== Presidential Reconstruction 总统重建


In 1864, Republican Abraham Lincoln chose Andrew Johnson, a Democratic senator from Tennessee, as his Vice Presidential candidate. Lincoln was looking for Southern support. He hoped that by selecting Johnson he would appeal to Southerners who never wanted to leave the Union.
1864年，共和党人亚伯拉罕·林肯, 选择来自田纳西州的民主党参议员安德鲁·约翰逊, 作为副总统候选人。*林肯正在寻求南方的支持。他希望通过选择约翰逊, 能够吸引那些从未想过离开联邦的南方人。*

Following Lincoln's assassination, Johnson's views now mattered a great deal. Would he follow Lincoln's moderate approach to reconciliation? Would he support limited black suffrage as Lincoln did? Would he follow the Radical Republicans and be harsh and punitive toward the South?
林肯遇刺后，约翰逊的观点变得非常重要。他会追随林肯温和的和解方针吗？他会像林肯那样支持有限的黑人选举权吗？他会追随激进共和党，对南方采取严厉和惩罚性的态度吗？

.Andrew Johnson 安德鲁·约翰逊

**他主张尽快让脱离联邦的南方州份回归，为此不惜放弃保护刚刚解放的黑奴，此举与共和党主导的国会严重冲突，**在1868年众议院决定弹劾总统之际达到高潮，最后参议院以一票之差裁定约翰逊罪名不成立。

田纳西等南方蓄奴州扯旗造反组建美利坚联盟国，但约翰逊坚定支持联邦，得知故乡州分家单过后, 其他参议员全部辞职，只有他例外。

**约翰逊根据"自有意愿"实施总统重建，**要求脱离联邦的州举办制宪大会, 并选举改革民事政府。*南方各州大批昔日领导人再度上台，通过"黑人法令"剥夺自由民的公民自由. 共和党国会议员拒绝坐视，想方设法阻止南方州份议员进入国会, 并以进步立法对抗"州政府"。总统否决此类国会法案，国会又推翻否决.* 他任内共有15次否决被国会推翻，比其他总统都多。**连赋予黑奴公民身份的第十四条修正案，约翰逊都反对。**

约翰逊极力反对联邦政府保障黑人权利，如此立场, 导致史学家普遍认为他在历任总统中, 口碑位居倒数。

The Radical Republicans believed blacks were entitled to the same political rights and opportunities as whites. They also believed that the Confederate leaders should be punished for their roles in the Civil War. Leaders like Pennsylvania REPRESENTATIVE THADDEUS STEVENS and Massachusetts SENATOR CHARLES SUMNER vigorously opposed Andrew Johnson's lenient policies. A great political battle was about to unfold.
激进共和党认为, 黑人有权享有与白人相同的政治权利和机会。他们还认为，南方邦联领导人应该因其在内战中所扮演的角色而受到惩罚。宾夕法尼亚州众议员撒迪厄斯·史蒂文斯, 和马萨诸塞州参议员查尔斯·萨姆纳等领导人, 强烈反对总统安德鲁·约翰逊的宽松政策。一场伟大的政治斗争即将展开。

Americans had long been suspicious of the federal government playing too large a role in the affairs of state. But the Radicals felt that extraordinary times called for direct intervention in state affairs and laws designed to protect the emancipated blacks. At the heart of their beliefs was the notion that blacks must be given a chance to compete in a free-labor economy. In 1866, this activist Congress also introduced a bill to extend the life of the Freedmen's Bureau and began work on a CIVIL RIGHTS BILL.
美国人长期以来一直怀疑, 联邦政府在国家事务中扮演过大的角色。但激进派认为，非常时期, 就是需要"直接干预国家事务"和"旨在保护被解放的黑人的法律"。他们信仰的核心是, 黑人必须有机会在自由劳动力经济中竞争。 1866 年，这位积极分子, 在国会还提出了一项延长自由民局寿命的法案，并开始制定"民权法案"。



President Johnson stood in opposition. He vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, claiming that it would bloat the size of government. He vetoed the Civil Rights Bill rejecting that blacks have the "same rights of property and person" as whites.
约翰逊总统表示反对。他否决了《自由民局法案》，声称该法案会导致政府规模膨胀。他否决了《民权法案》，拒绝承认黑人与白人拥有“相同的财产和人身权利”。

.自由民局
"自由民局"是美国历史上第一个联邦福利机构，其全称为“难民、自由民, 及被遗弃土地管理局”，隶属陆军部。它是1865年3月3日距离内战结束十多天时建立的，主要任务是战后监督, 和处理内战期间一切被遗弃的土地，处理与难民及自由民（内战中被解放的黑奴）相关的一切问题。

Moderate Republicans were appalled at Johnson's racism. They joined with the Radicals to overturn Johnson's Civil Rights Act veto. This marked the first time in history that a major piece of legislation was overturned. The Radicals hoped that the Civil Rights Act would lead to an active federal judiciary with courts enforcing rights.
温和的共和党人, 对约翰逊的种族主义感到震惊。他们与激进派一起, 推翻了"约翰逊对民权法案的否决"。这标志着历史上第一次重大立法被推翻。激进派希望《民权法案》能够建立一个积极的联邦司法机构，并由法院执行权利。

Congress then turned its attention to amending the Constitution. In 1867 they approved the far-reaching Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibited "states from abridging equality before the law." The second part of the Amendment provided for a reduction of a state's representatives if suffrage was denied. Republicans, in essence, offered the South a choice — accept black enfranchisement or lose congressional representation. A third clause barred ex-Confederates from holding state or national office.
**国会随后将注意力转向修改宪法。**1867年，**他们通过了影响深远的"第十四修正案"，禁止“各州剥夺'法律面前人人平等的权利'”。修正案的第二部分规定，如果一个州中, 黑人的选举权被剥夺，就减少该州在国会的代表人数。**实质上，**共和党给了南方一个选择——要么接受黑人选举权，要么失去国会代表席位。**第三条条款, 则禁止"前邦联成员"担任州或国家公职。

Emboldened by the work of the Fourteenth Amendment and by local political victories in the 1866 elections, the Republicans went on to introduce the Reconstruction Act of 1867. This removed the right to vote and seek office by "leading rebels." Now the SOUTHERN UNIONISTS — Southerners who supported the Union during the War — became the new Southern leadership. The Reconstruction Act also divided the South into five military districts under commanders empowered to employ the army to protect black property and citizens.
在第十四修正案的作用, 和1866年地方政治选举的胜利的鼓舞下，共和党人继续提出了1867年重建法案。这项法案取消了“领导叛乱分子”者的投票权和竞选公职的权利。现在，在战争期间支持"北方联邦"的南方联合主义者, 成为了新的南方领导人。《重建法案》还将南方划分为五个军区，指挥官有权动用军队保护黑人财产和公民。

The first two years of Congressional Reconstruction saw Southern states rewrite their Constitutions and the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Congress seemed fully in control. One thing stood in the way — it was President Johnson himself. Radical leaders employed an extraordinary Constitutional remedy to clear the impediment — Presidential impeachment.
国会重建的头两年, 见证了南方各州重写宪法, 并批准了第十四修正案。国会似乎完全掌控一切。但有件事阻碍了这一进程——那就是约翰逊总统本人。激进领导人采用了一种非凡的宪法补救措施, 来清除障碍——弹劾总统。



In the spring of 1868, Andrew Johnson became the first President to be IMPEACHED. The heavily Republican House of Representatives brought 11 articles of impeachment against Johnson. Many insiders knew that the Congress was looking for any excuse to rid themselves of an uncooperative President.
1868 年春，安德鲁·约翰逊成为第一位遭到弹劾的总统。共和党占多数的众议院, 对约翰逊提出了 11 项弹劾条款。许多内部人士都知道, 国会正在寻找任何借口, 来摆脱不合作的总统。

Impeachment refers to the process specified in the Constitution for trial and removal from office of any federal official accused of misconduct. It has two stages. The House of Representatives charges the official with articles of impeachment. "TREASON, BRIBERY, OR OTHER HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS" are defined as impeachable offenses. Once charged by the House, the case goes before the Senate for a trial.
弹劾是指宪法规定的程序 -- "审判和罢免任何被指控行为不当的联邦官员"。它有两个阶段。众议院以弹劾条款, 指控该官员。 “叛国罪、贿赂罪, 或其他重罪和轻罪”, 被定义为可弹劾的罪行。*一旦"众议院"提出指控，此案将提交"参议院"审理。*


In 1867, Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, which EDWIN STANTON, as Secretary of War, was charged with enforcing. Johnson opposed the Act and tried to remove Stanton — in direct violation of the TENURE OF OFFICE ACT. Nine of the articles of impeachment related to Johnson's removal of Stanton. Another two charged Johnson with disgracing Congress.
1867 年，国会通过了《重建法案》，并由战争部长"埃德温·斯坦顿"负责执行。约翰逊反对该法案, 并试图罢免斯坦顿——这直接违反了《任期法》。其中九项弹劾条款与"约翰逊罢免斯坦顿"有关。另外, 有两人指控约翰逊侮辱国会。

Johnson's defense was simple: only a clear violation of the law warranted his removal.
*约翰逊的辩护很简单：只有他明显违反法律, 才能将他免职。*

But as with politics, things are rarely simple. Other factors came into play. Since there was no Vice President at the time, the next in line for the Presidency was BENJAMIN WADE, a Radical unpopular with businessmen and moderates. And along with legal wrangling, assurance was given from Johnson's backers that the Radicals' Southern policies would be accepted.
但就像政治一样，事情很少是简单的。其他因素也起了作用。由于当时没有副总统，下一个总统候选人是本杰明·韦德，一个不受商人和温和派欢迎的激进分子。除了法律上的争论，约翰逊的支持者保证，激进派的南方政策将被接受。

In May of 1868, 35 Senators voted to convict, one vote short of the required 2/3 majority. Seven Republican Senators had jumped party lines and found Johnson not guilty. Johnson dodged a bullet and was able to serve out his term. It would be 130 years before another President — BILL CLINTON — would be impeached.
1868 年 5 月，35 名参议员投票判定约翰逊有罪，比所需的 2/3 多数票少一票。七名共和党参议员超越党派界限，认定约翰逊无罪。约翰逊躲过一劫，得以完成任期。 130 年后，另一位总统——比尔·克林顿——才被弹劾。


Emancipated blacks began finding the new world looking much like the old world. Pressure to return to plantations increased. Poll taxes, violence at the ballot box, and literacy tests kept African-Americans from voting — sidestepping the 15th Amendment.
然而, 获得解放的黑人, 开始发现新世界与旧世界非常相似。返回种植园的压力增加。人头税、投票箱暴力, 和识字测试, 使非裔美国人无法投票——回避了第十五修正案。

Slavery was over. The struggle for equality had just begun.
奴隶制结束了。争取平等的斗争才刚刚开始。
