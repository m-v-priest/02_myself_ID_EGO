=== Politics from Camelot to Watergate 从卡米洛特到水门事件的政治

Lyndon Johnson hoped to complete Kennedy's work. His Great Society plan declared a "war on poverty" that produced a glut of legislation unseen since the days of Franklin Roosevelt's Hundred Days. Welfare benefits were increased, health care costs were defrayed, and funds were allotted for cleaning the air and water, rebuilding cities, and subsidizing the arts and humanities.
**林登·约翰逊希望完成肯尼迪的工作。他的伟大社会计划宣布了一场“向贫困宣战”，产生了自富兰克林·罗斯福百日执政以来从未见过的大量立法。**福利增加，医疗保健费用增加，并分配资金用于清洁空气和水、重建城市以及补贴艺术和人文学科。

A Civil Rights Act ended legal discrimination in public accommodations with regard to race.
"民权法案"结束了公共设施中种族方面的法律歧视。

Unfortunately for Johnson, the domestic minded president became mired in a foreign imbroglio — the war in Southeast Asia. Vietnam would taint his legislative successes and end the possibility of a second Johnson term.
对于约翰逊来说不幸的是，这位注重国内事务的总统陷入了一场外交纠纷——东南亚战争。越南战争将玷污他的立法成就，并结束约翰逊第二个任期的可能性。

By 1968, the zeal for domestic reform was squelched by an increasingly popular war. Families and friends across America were divided by the conflict. Assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy only fanned the flames, and by the end of the decade most Americans were weary of war, rioting, and political crusades — Americans sought a return to normalcy.
到了 1968 年，国内改革的热情, 被日益流行的战争所浇灭。美国各地的家人和朋友因冲突而分裂。马丁·路德·金和罗伯特·肯尼迪的暗杀只是火上浇油，到20世纪90年代末，大多数美国人厌倦了战争、骚乱和政治运动——美国人寻求回归正常。

==== Kennedy's New Frontier 肯尼迪的新边疆

Domestically, Kennedy continued in the tradition of liberal Democrats Roosevelt and Truman to some extent. He signed legislation raising the minimum wage and increasing Social Security benefits. He raised money for research into mental illness and allocated funds to develop impoverished rural areas. He showed approval for the civil rights movement by supporting James Meredith's attempt to enroll at the University of Mississippi and by ordering his Attorney General, brother Robert Kennedy, to protect the freedom riders in the South.
在国内，肯尼迪在一定程度上延续了自由民主党人罗斯福和杜鲁门的传统。他签署了提高最低工资, 和增加社会保障福利的立法。他筹集资金用于精神疾病研究，并拨款发展贫困农村地区。他支持詹姆斯·梅雷迪思进入密西西比大学就读，并命令他的当司法部长弟弟罗伯特·肯尼迪, 保护南方的自由乘车者，这表明了他对民权运动的认可。


However, most of Kennedy's more revolutionary proposals languished in the conservative Congress. He wished to protect millions of acres of wilderness lands from developments, but the Congress refused. His efforts to provide federal funds to elementary and secondary schools were denied. His Medicare plan to provide health insurance for the nation's elderly failed to achieve the necessary support. Congress was dominated by a coalition of Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats who refused to expand the New Deal any further.
然而，肯尼迪的大多数更具革命性的提议, 在保守的"国会"中都受到了冷落。他希望保护数百万英亩的荒地免遭开发，但国会拒绝了。他为中小学提供联邦资金的努力, 遭到拒绝。他为全国老年人提供健康保险的医疗保险计划, 未能获得必要的支持。国会由"共和党"和"保守的南方民主党"联盟主导，他们拒绝进一步扩大"新政"。

In his abbreviated Presidency, Kennedy failed to accomplish all he wanted domestically. But the ideas and proposals he supported survived his assassination. Medicare, federal support for education, and wilderness protection all became part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
在他短暂的总统任期内，肯尼迪未能在国内实现他想要的一切。但他支持的想法和建议在他遇刺后幸存下来。医疗保险、联邦政府对教育的支持, 和荒野保护, 都成为林登·约翰逊伟大社会的一部分。

Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated Kennedy in November, 1963. His death provided a popular mandate for these important programs. In the tumultuous years that followed, many yearned for the happy Kennedy years — a return to Camelot.
1963年11月，李·哈维·奥斯瓦尔德暗杀了肯尼迪。他的死为这些重要的项目提供了广泛的支持。在随后的动荡岁月里，许多人渴望回到卡梅洛特，回到肯尼迪的幸福岁月。

==== Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" 林登·约翰逊的《伟大社会》


Lyndon Baines Johnson moved quickly to establish himself in the office of the Presidency. Despite his conservative voting record in the Senate, Johnson soon reacquainted himself with his liberal roots. LBJ sponsored the largest reform agenda since Roosevelt's New Deal.
林登·贝恩斯·约翰逊, 很快就在总统职位上站稳了脚跟。尽管约翰逊他在参议院的投票记录, 属于"保守派"，但他很快就重新认识了自己的"自由派"根源。*林登·约翰逊发起了自"罗斯福新政"以来最大规模的改革议程。*

The aftershock of Kennedy's assassination provided a climate for Johnson to complete the unfinished work of JFK's New Frontier. He had eleven months before the election of 1964 to prove to American voters that he deserved a chance to be President in his own right.
肯尼迪遇刺的余震, 为约翰逊完成肯尼迪新边疆未竟的工作提供了氛围。*距离 1964 年大选还有 11 个月的时间，他需要向美国选民证明，他凭借自己的能力应该有机会担任总统。*

Two very important pieces of legislation were passed. First, the Civil Rights Bill that JFK promised to sign was passed into law. The Civil Rights Act banned discrimination based on race and gender in employment and ending segregation in all public facilities.
通过了两项非常重要的立法。首先，肯尼迪承诺签署的"民权法案"获得通过成为法律。 《民权法案》禁止就业中基于种族和性别的歧视，并结束所有公共设施中的种族隔离。


Johnson also signed the omnibus ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1964. The law created the Office of Economic Opportunity aimed at attacking the roots of American poverty. A Job Corps was established to provide valuable vocational training.
约翰逊还签署了 1964 年综合经济机会法案。该法案设立了"经济机会办公室"，旨在解决美国贫困的根源。成立了就业团来提供有价值的"职业培训"。

Head Start, a preschool program designed to help disadvantaged students arrive at kindergarten ready to learn was put into place. The VOLUNTEERS IN SERVICE TO AMERICA (VISTA) was set up as a domestic Peace Corps. Schools in impoverished American regions would now receive volunteer teaching attention. Federal funds were sent to struggling communities to attack unemployment and illiteracy.
Head Start 是一项学前计划，旨在帮助弱势学生进入幼儿园做好学习准备。美国志愿服务组织 (VISTA) 是作为国内和平队成立的。美国贫困地区的学校, 现在将得到志愿者教学的关注。联邦资金被送往陷入困境的社区，以解决失业和文盲问题。

As he campaigned in 1964, Johnson declared a "war on poverty." He challenged Americans to build a "Great Society" that eliminated the troubles of the poor. Johnson won a decisive victory over his archconservative Republican opponent Barry Goldwater of Arizona.
1964 年，约翰逊在竞选, 时宣布“向贫困宣战”。他向美国人提出挑战，要建立一个消除穷人烦恼的“伟大社会”。约翰逊赢得了对他的主要保守派共和党对手亚利桑那州的巴里·戈德华特的决定性胜利。

Lyndon B. Johnson signs Civil Rights Act
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was part of Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society" reform package — the largest social improvement agenda by a President since FDR's "New Deal."
1964 年的"民权法案"是林登·约翰逊 (Lyndon B. Johnson) 的“伟大社会”改革方案的一部分，这是自罗斯福“新政”以来总统制定的最大的社会改善议程。

Johnson was an accomplished legislator and used his connections in Congress and forceful personality to pass his agenda.
约翰逊是一位卓有成就的立法者，利用他在国会的关系和强有力的个性, 来通过他的议程。

By 1966, Johnson was pleased with the progress he had made. But soon events in Southeast Asia began to overshadow his domestic achievements. Funds he had envisioned to fight his war on poverty were now diverted to the war in Vietnam. He found himself maligned by conservatives for his domestic policies and by liberals for his hawkish stance on Vietnam.
到 1966 年，约翰逊对自己取得的进步感到满意。但很快东南亚发生的事件(即越战), 开始掩盖他在国内取得的成就。他原本计划用于消除贫困的资金, 现在被转用于越南战争。他发现自己因国内政策而受到"保守派"的诽谤，因对越南的强硬立场而受到"自由派"的诽谤。

.自由派vs保守派

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|保守派(右) social liberalism |自由派(左) Conservatism

|通常指的是对资本主义传统价值观（少监管、小政府）和基督教伦理的坚持. (*这也是美国开国时, 开国元勋们那时持有的思想*)
|通常对社会问题的观点更加开放，经济政策有“社会主义”的影子（高福利、大政府）. (*自由派名字中的"自由", 其实就是对"保守派"思想的偏离.*)


|其特征包括尊重美国传统、支持共和主义、古典自由主义、*限制联邦政府权力、提倡州权、小政府。*

"共和党"的主流意识形态, 亦为保守主义.



|**是一种偏向"社会公平"及"经济干预"的自由主义，接近"社会民主主义"及"进步主义". 其学说在经济上采取"凯恩斯主义"的消费经济学，强调政府干预市场经济；**社会哲学上它看重公平多于效率，*主张发展"福利主义"和"社会规划"。社会自由主义总是与"福利国家"相联系。*

二战后社会"自由主义"运动, 常与和工人阶级、工会运动联系在一起.

在美国，"社会自由主义"一词用于将其与"古典自由主义"或"自由放任主义"区别开来，**其中"古典自由主义"影响美国早期一百多年的政治和经济思想，直到经济大萧条和罗斯福"新政"，"社会自由主义"才逐渐发挥影响力，并成为民主党的主流。**自巴拉克·奥巴马就任总统后, "社会自由主义"在美国的影响力达到巅峰.

|
|欧洲很多国家都是"高福利"政策：全民医保，公民缴税也比较高。**凡是"高福利高税收"就意味着政府的规模和职责会比较大（“大政府”），并且政府对经济活动的干预较大（通过"高税收"进行"收入再分配"）。**这本身与亚当·斯密的“小政府”和“完全市场经济”的传统资本主义理论不符（注重“效率”），而是有一点"社会主义"的影子（注重“公平”）。

另外，西欧国家对于大麻、同性婚姻、安乐死、堕胎等问题的态度要比美国开放。

所以，西欧在经济政策上的相对高税收和高福利，与相对开放的社会环境，意味着与**西欧相比美国, 更有“自由派”（偏左）的政治倾向.** 恰美国"民主党"就代表了美国的“自由派”。所以西欧各国更偏爱民主党的拜登，而不喜欢特朗普。

拜登以及奥巴马总统时期的民主党, 推行“全民医保”……明显带有“高福利”的经济特征，属于典型“左”派的经济政策，带有“社会主义”的性质。“全民医保”意味着政府的职责、权力和规模要扩大，要建立“大政府”。而特朗普的共和党反对“全民医保”，主张减税和制造业回归，实际上恢复了“政府应减少对经济干预”的资本主义传统，属于“右”派的经济政策。所以**在美国，民主党更偏向“公平”，共和党更偏向“效率”。**

“全民医保”对弱势群体的意义更大，包括贫困人群和长期受病患折磨的人。对于健康人群，往往持反对立场，认为政府剥夺了公民选择的自由。所以，“全民医保”在美国争议很大，全国大约一半人反对，另一半支持。

==== Triangular Diplomacy: U.S., USSR, and China 三角外交：美国、苏联和中国

predecessor, RICHARD NIXON longed to be known for his expertise in FOREIGN POLICY. Although occupied with the Vietnam War, Nixon also initiated several new trends in American diplomatic relations. Nixon contended that the communist world consisted of two rival powers — the Soviet Union and China. Given the long history of animosity between those two nations, Nixon and his adviser HENRY KISSINGER, decided to exploit that rivalry to win advantages for the United States. That policy became known as triangular diplomacy.
**与他的前任不同，理查德·尼克松渴望以其在"外交政策"方面的专业知识而闻名。**尽管忙于越南战争，尼克松也开创了美国外交关系的几个新趋势。*尼克松认为，共产主义世界由两个敌对大国组成——苏联和中国。鉴于这两个国家之间长期以来的敌对历史，尼克松和他的顾问亨利·基辛格决定利用这种竞争, 为美国赢得优势。这项政策被称为"三角外交"。*

As President Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger made a secret trip to arrange the first-ever Presidential visit to China in 1972. He would become Nixon's secretary of state the next year.
作为尼克松总统的国家安全顾问，亨利·基辛格于1972年秘密出访，安排总统首次访华。次年他就任尼克松的国务卿。

As expected, this maneuver caused concern in the Soviet Union. Nixon hoped to establish a DÉTENTE, or an easing of tensions, with the USSR. In May 1972, Nixon made an equally significant trip to Moscow to support a nuclear arms agreement. The product of this visit was the STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION TREATY (SALT I). The United States and the Soviet Union pledged to limit the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles each side would build, and to prevent the development of anti-ballistic missile systems.
不出所料，这一举动引起了苏联的担忧。尼克松希望与苏联建立缓和关系，即缓和紧张局势。 1972 年 5 月，尼克松对莫斯科进行了一次同样重要的访问，以支持核武器协议。这次访问的成果是《战略武器限制条约》（SALT I）。美国和苏联承诺, 限制双方建造的洲际弹道导弹的数量，并阻止反弹道导弹系统的发展。


Arguably, Nixon may have been the only president who could have accomplished this arrangement. Anticommunism was raging in the United States. Americans would view with great suspicion any attempts to make peace with either the Soviet Union or China. No one would challenge Nixon's anticommunist credentials, given his reputation as a staunch red-baiter in his early career. His overtures were chiefly accepted by the American public. Although the Cold War still burned hotly across the globe, the efforts of Nixon and Kissinger led to a temporary thaw.
可以说，尼克松可能是唯一能够完成这一安排的总统。反共主义在美国甚嚣尘上。美国人会对任何与苏联或中国讲和的尝试, 抱有极大的怀疑。考虑到尼克松在其早期职业生涯中作为坚定的"红色诱饵者"的声誉，没有人会挑战他的反共资格。他的提议主要被美国公众接受。尽管冷战仍在全球范围内激烈进行，但尼克松和基辛格的努力使冷战暂时解冻。

=== Shaping a New America 塑造新美国


As awareness was being raised across America about civil rights for African Americans, it was only natural that other groups who felt marginalized by the American mainstream to make demands of their own. Not since the drive for suffrage had a drive for women's rights met with much success. A new FEMINIST MOVEMENT emerged in the 1960s pressing for modern reforms.
**随着美国各地对"非裔美国人公民权利"的认识不断提高，其他感到被美国主流边缘化的群体, 自然也提出了自己的要求。**自从争取选举权以来，争取妇女权利的运动, 还没有取得太大成功。 *20 世纪 60 年代出现了一场新的女权主义运动，迫切要求现代改革。*

With few exceptions, women were excluded from the highest paying jobs, earning only a fraction of the wages of their male counterparts. The 1950s cult of the housewife discouraged women from holding full-time jobs and from seeking higher degrees. The call for legality and availability of birth control options like the pill galvanized many of feminists. Eventually, the right to obtain a safe, legal abortion became a new milestone. These demands and others led to the proposal of an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, which would forever ban sex discrimination in the nation's laws and practices.
除了少数例外，女性被排除在薪酬最高的工作之外，其工资仅为男性同行的一小部分。 **20 世纪 50 年代对家庭主妇的崇拜, 阻碍了女性从事全职工作和寻求更高学位。**对避孕药等避孕措施的"合法性"和"可用性"的呼吁, 激励了许多女权主义者。*最终，获得安全、"合法堕胎的权利"成为一个新的里程碑。这些要求和其他要求, 导致了"宪法平等权利修正案"的提出，该修正案将永远禁止国家法律和实践中的"性别歧视"。*



LATINO AMERICANS and NATIVE AMERICANS had also languished in the bottom economic strata throughout much of the prosperous 1950s. Radical and moderate ethnic leaders organized to close this gap. By the end of the decade, the time was ripe for gay Americans to demand equality as well. The politics of identity dominated America as these and other disadvantaged American groups found their voices of protest.
在繁荣的 20 世纪 50 年代的大部分时间里，拉丁美洲人和原住民也一直处于经济底层。激进和温和的民族领导人组织起来缩小这一差距。到本世纪末，美国"同性恋者"要求平等的时机也已经成熟。当这些人和其他弱势美国群体发出抗议声音时，身份政治主导了美国。

Another battle cry was sounded to save the planet from environmental destruction. Toxic emissions, deadly pesticides, and fears of nuclear holocaust brought many concerned Americans together in the earth awareness movement. This time "GREEN" ACTIVISTS went beyond conservation of resources to demand regulation of economic activities that could hurt the nation's environment.
"拯救地球免遭环境破坏"的又一战斗口号响起。有毒排放、致命杀虫剂, 以及对核浩劫的恐惧, 使许多关心此事的美国人聚集在一起发起地球意识运动。这次“绿色”活动家超越了保护资源的范畴，要求对可能损害国家环境的经济活动进行监管。

In the 1960s, the first baby boomers entered college. These students were the largest class of young Americans ever to enter the halls of ivy. Unlike the "Silent Generation" of 1950s youth, the baby boomers were vocal about reforming democracy in the United States and the American presence abroad. College administrators were confronted with inspired students requesting reforms of the core academic curriculum, greater opportunities for free speech, and more relaxed college rules. A small, but highly visible segment of students withdrew from the mainstream and created a counterculture with profound impact on American values, fashion, and music.
**20 世纪 60 年代，第一批婴儿潮一代进入大学。这些学生是有史以来进入常春藤名校的最大一批美国年轻人。与 20 世纪 50 年代的“沉默的一代”不同，婴儿潮一代, 大声疾呼美国的民主改革和美国在海外的存在。大学管理人员面临着一些充满灵感的学生，他们要求改革核心学术课程、提供更多的言论自由机会, 和更宽松的大学规则。**一小部分学生退出了主流，创造了一种对美国价值观、时尚和音乐产生深远影响的反主流文化。
