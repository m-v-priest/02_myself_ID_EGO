The most destructive war in America's history was fought among its own people.
美国历史上最具破坏性的战争, 是在自己的人民之间进行的。

The CIVIL WAR was a tragedy of unimaginable proportions. For four long and bloody years, Americans were killed at the hands of other Americans. One of every 25 American men perished in the war. Over 640,000 soldiers were killed. Many civilians also died — in numbers often unrecorded.
内战是一场规模难以想象的悲剧。**在漫长而血腥的四年里，**美国人被其他美国人杀害。*每 25 名美国人中就有 1 人在战争中丧生。超过64万士兵阵亡。许多平民也死亡——死亡人数往往没有记录。*

At the battle of Antietam, more Americans were killed than on any other single day in all of American history. On that day, 22,719 soldiers fell to their deaths — four times the number of Americans lost during the D-Day assault on Normandy in WWII. In fact, more American soldiers died in the Civil War than in all other American wars combined.
在安提特姆战役中，阵亡的美国人比美国历史上任何一天都要多。那天，有 22,719 名士兵倒下身亡——是二战诺曼底诺曼底登陆日袭击中美国阵亡人数的四倍。*事实上，在内战中死亡的美国士兵, 比美国所有其他战争中死亡的士兵总和还要多。*


Four long years of battle changed everything. No other event since the Revolutionary War altered the political, social, economic, and cultural fabric of the United States. In the end, a predominantly industrial society triumphed over an agricultural one. The Old South was forever changed. The blemish of slavery was finally removed from American life, though its legacy would long linger.
四年漫长的战斗改变了一切。**自独立战争以来，没有任何其他事件改变了美国的政治、社会、经济和文化结构。最终，工业社会战胜了农业社会。老南方永远地改变了。奴隶制的污点终于从美国人的生活中消失了，**尽管它的遗产仍将长期存在。

== Fort Sumter

began at Fort Sumter.
这一切都始于萨姆特堡。

On December 20, 1860, South Carolina seceded from the Union. Five days later, 68 federal troops stationed in Charleston, South Carolina, withdrew to FORT SUMTER, an island in CHARLESTON HARBOR. The North considered the fort to be the property of the United States government. The people of South Carolina believed it belonged to the new Confederacy. Four months later, the first engagement of the Civil War took place on this disputed soil.
1860 年 12 月 20 日，"南卡罗来纳州"脱离联邦。五天后，驻扎在南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿的68名联邦军队, 撤至查尔斯顿港的"萨姆特堡岛屿"。**北方认为, 这座堡垒是美国政府的财产。南卡罗来纳州人民则相信, 它属于新的邦联。**四个月后，内战的第一次交战在这片有争议的土地上发生。

In February 1861, Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as the provisional president of the Confederate States of America, in Montgomery, Alabama. On March 4,1861, Abraham Lincoln took his oath of office as president of the Union in Washington, DC. The fate of Fort Sumter lay in the hands of these two leaders.
1861 年 2 月，杰斐逊·戴维斯, 在阿拉巴马州蒙哥马利就任"美利坚联盟国"临时总统。 1861 年 3 月 4 日，亚伯拉罕·林肯在华盛顿特区宣誓就任"联邦总统"。萨姆特堡的命运, 掌握在这两位领导人的手中。

As weeks passed, pressure grew for Lincoln to take some action on Fort Sumter and to reunite the states. Lincoln thought of the Southern secession as "artificial." When Jefferson Davis sent a group of commissioners to Washington to negotiate for the transfer of Fort Sumter to South Carolina, they were promptly rebuffed.
几周过去了，林肯面临的压力越来越大，要求他对萨姆特堡采取一些行动, 并重新统一各州。林肯认为, 南方分裂是“人为的”。当杰斐逊·戴维斯派出一组专员前往华盛顿就将萨姆特堡移交给南卡罗来纳州进行谈判时，他们立即遭到拒绝。

Lincoln had a dilemma. Fort Sumter was running out of supplies, but an attack on the fort would appear as Northern aggression. States that still remained part of the Union (such as Virginia and North Carolina) might be driven into the secessionist camp. People at home and abroad might become sympathetic to the South. Yet Lincoln could not allow his troops to starve or surrender and risk showing considerable weakness.
**林肯陷入了两难的境地。萨姆特堡的补给即将耗尽，但对该堡的袭击将被视为北方对南方的侵略。这可能会导致当前仍然是联邦成员的州（例如弗吉尼亚州, 和北卡罗来纳州）可能会被赶入分裂主义阵营。**国内外人民可能会同情南方。然而林肯不能允许他的部队挨饿或投降，并冒着表现出相当虚弱的风险。



At last he developed a plan. On April 6, Lincoln told the governor of South Carolina that he was going to send provisions to Fort Sumter. He would send no arms, troops, or ammunition — unless, of course, South Carolina attacked.
*最后他制定了一个计划。 4月6日，林肯告诉"南卡罗来纳州"州长，他将向"萨姆特堡"运送物资。他不会派遣任何武器、军队或弹药——当然，除非"南卡罗来纳州"发动袭击。*

Now the dilemma sat with Jefferson Davis. Attacking Lincoln's resupply brigade would make the South the aggressive party. But he simply could not allow the fort to be resupplied. J.G. GILCHRIST, a Southern newspaper writer, warned, "Unless you sprinkle the blood in the face of the people of Alabama, they will be back in the old Union in less than ten days."
现在，杰斐逊·戴维斯面临着两难的境地。**攻击林肯的补给旅, 将使南方成为侵略方。**但他根本不允许堡垒得到补给​​。


The Civil War began at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861, when Confederate artillery, under the command of GENERAL PIERRE GUSTAVE T. BEAUREGARD, opened fire on Fort Sumter. Confederate batteries showered the fort with over 3,000 shells in a three-and-a-half day period. Anderson surrendered. Ironically, Beauregard had developed his military skills under Anderson's instruction at West Point. This was the first of countless relationships and families devastated in the Civil War. The fight was on.
**内战于 1861 年 4 月 12 日凌晨 4 点 30 分开始，**当时南方邦联炮兵在皮埃尔·古斯塔夫·T·博勒加德将军的指挥下向萨姆特堡开火。


Within days of the fall of Fort Sumter, four more states joined the Confederacy: Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. The battle lines were now drawn.
萨姆特堡陷落后的几天内，又有四个州加入了南方邦联：弗吉尼亚州、北卡罗来纳州、田纳西州和阿肯色州。战线现已划定。

== 南北经济实力对比

On paper, the Union outweighed the Confederacy in almost every way. Nearly 21 million people lived in 23 Northern states. The South claimed just 9 million people — including 3.5 million slaves — in 11 CONFEDERATE STATES. Despite the North's greater population, however, the South had an army almost equal in size during the first year of the war.
**从纸面上看，联邦几乎在所有方面都超过了邦联。近 2100 万人居住在 23 个北方州。南方在 11 个邦联州中只拥有 900 万人，其中包括 350 万奴隶。**然而，尽管北方人口较多，*但南方在战争的第一年拥有一支几乎同等规模的军队。*

The North had an enormous industrial advantage as well. At the beginning of the war, the Confederacy had only one-ninth the industrial capacity of the Union. But that statistic was misleading. In 1860, the North manufactured 97 percent of the country's firearms, 96 percent of its railroad locomotives, 94 percent of its cloth, 93 percent of its pig iron, and over 90 percent of its boots and shoes. The North had twice the density of railroads per square mile. There was not even one rifleworks in the entire South.
*北方也拥有巨大的工业优势。战争开始时，南部邦联的工业能力仅为联邦的九分之一。但该统计数据具有误导性。*  1860年，北方生产了全国97%的枪支、96%的铁路机车、94%的布料、93%的生铁以及90%以上的靴子和鞋子。北方每平方英里的铁路密度是北方的两倍。整个南方连一处步枪工厂都没有。

Civil War artillery
The South was at a severe disadvantage when it came to manufacturing, but the Confederacy managed to keep its guns firing by creating ammunition from melted-down bells from churches and town squares.
**南方在制造业方面处于严重劣势，**但联邦通过利用教堂和城镇广场熔化的钟制造弹药，设法保持枪支的射击。

All of the principal ingredients of GUNPOWDER were imported. Since the North controlled the navy, the seas were in the hands of the Union. A blockade could suffocate the South. Still, the Confederacy was not without resources and willpower.
**火药的所有主要成分都是进口的。由于北方控制了海军，海洋就掌握在联邦手中。封锁可能会让南方窒息。**尽管如此，联邦并非没有资源和意志力。

The South could produce all the food it needed, though transporting it to soldiers and civilians was a major problem. The South also had a great nucleus of TRAINED OFFICERS. Seven of the eight military colleges in the country were in the South.
*南方可以生产所需的所有食物，但将其运送给士兵和平民是一个大问题。南方也有一支训练有素的军官队伍。全国八所军事院校中有七所位于南方。*

The South also proved to be very resourceful. By the end of the war, it had established armories and foundries in several states. They built huge gunpowder mills and melted down thousands of church and plantation bells for bronze to build cannon.
事实证明，南方也非常足智多谋。战争结束时，它已在几个州建立了军械库和铸造厂。他们建造了巨大的火药厂，并熔化了数千个教堂和种植园的钟，以青铜制造大炮。

The South's greatest strength lay in the fact that it was fighting on the defensive in its own territory. Familiar with the landscape, Southerners could harass Northern invaders.
*南方最大的优势在于, 它在自己的领土上进行防御性战斗。熟悉地形的南方人可以骚扰北方入侵者。*

The military and political objectives of the Union were much more difficult to accomplish. The Union had to invade, conquer, and occupy the South. It had to destroy the South's capacity and will to resist — a formidable challenge in any war.
北方联邦的军事和政治目标要实现起来要困难得多。联邦必须入侵、征服和占领南方。它必须摧毁南方的抵抗能力和意志——这在任何战争中都是一个巨大的挑战。



Southerners enjoyed the initial advantage of morale: The South was fighting to maintain its way of life, whereas the North was fighting to maintain a union. Slavery did not become a moral cause of the Union effort until Lincoln announced the EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION in 1863.
**南方人享有最初的士气优势：**南方为维持其生活方式而奋斗，*而北方则为维持联邦的存在而奋斗。直到 1863 年林肯宣布《奴隶制宣言》后，奴隶制才成为北方联邦努力的道德事业。*

When the war began, many key questions were still unanswered. What if the slave states of Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, and Delaware had joined the Confederacy? What if Britain or France had come to the aid of the South? What if a few decisive early Confederate victories had turned Northern public opinion against the war?
*战争开始时，许多关键问题仍未得到解答。如果马里兰州、肯塔基州、密苏里州和特拉华州等奴隶州, 加入了南方邦联会怎样？如果英国或法国援助南方怎么办？如果南部邦联早期的几场决定性胜利, 使北方公众舆论反对战争怎么办？*

Indeed, the North looked much better on paper. But many factors undetermined at the outbreak of war could have tilted the balance sheet toward a different outcome.
事实上，北方在纸面上看起来要好得多。但**战争爆发时的许多不确定因素, 可能会使资产负债表的天平, 朝着不同的结果倾斜。**

== The Battle of Bull Run / the Battle of Manassas Junction

When the war began in April 1861, most Americans expected the conflict to be brief.
*1861 年 4 月战争爆发时，大多数美国人(都持有人性中常见的乐观心态,)预计冲突会很短暂。*

When President Lincoln called upon the governors and states of the Union to furnish him with 75,000 soldiers, he asked for an enlistment of only 90 days. When the Confederacy moved its capital to Richmond, Virginia, 100 miles from Washington, everyone expected a decisive battle to take place on the ground between the two cities.
当林肯总统呼吁联邦州长和各州, 向他提供 75,000 名士兵时，他只要求入伍 90 天。当南部邦联将首都迁至距华盛顿 100 英里的弗吉尼亚州"里士满"时，每个人都预计, 两座城市之间将只会发生一场决定性的战斗。

In the spring of 1861, 35,000 Confederate troops led by General Pierre Beauregard moved north to protect Richmond against invasion. Lincoln's army had almost completed its 90-day enlistment requirement and still its field commander, GENERAL IRVIN MCDOWELL, did not want to fight. Pressured to act, on July 18 (three months after the war had begun) McDowell marched his army of 37,000 into Virginia.
1861 年春，皮埃尔·博勒加德 (Pierre Beauregard) 将军率领 35,000 名南方邦联军队北上，保护"里士满"免受入侵。林肯的军队几乎已经完成了 90 天的入伍要求，但其战地指挥官"欧文·麦克道威尔"将军仍然不想参加战斗。迫于(受到林肯总统要求)采取行动的压力，"麦克道尔"于 7 月 18 日（战争开始三个月后）率领 37,000 人的军队进入弗吉尼亚。


Naming Battles
命名之战

The Battle of Bull Run was also known as the Battle of Manassas Junction. Frequently, major battles had two names. The South named battles after the nearby cities. The North named them after the nearby waterways.
"布尔朗战役"也被称为"马纳萨斯枢纽战役"。*重大战役常常有两个名称。南方以附近的城市命名战争。北方以附近的水道命名它们。*

.案例
====
.布尔朗战役 The Battle of Bull Run
第一次布尔朗战役，被南方联盟军队称为第一次马纳萨斯战役 ，是美国内战的第一场重大战役。这场战斗于 1861 年 7 月 21 日在弗吉尼亚州, 威廉王子县打响，该县位于马纳萨斯市以北，距离华盛顿特区西南偏西约 30 英里。联邦军部署缓慢，让南方联盟增援部队有时间到达乘铁路。双方都有大约 18,000 名训练有素、领导不善的军队。这场战斗是南方联盟的胜利，随后联邦军队在战后撤退。

Over 4,800 soldiers were killed, wounded, or listed as missing from both armies in the battle. The next day, Lincoln named MAJOR GENERAL GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN to command the new ARMY OF THE POTOMAC and signed legislation for the enlistment of one million troops to last three years.
双方军队共有 4,800 多名士兵在战斗中阵亡、受伤或失踪。第二天，**林肯**任命"乔治·B·麦克莱伦"少将, 指挥新的"波托马克军团"，*并签署了征募 100 万军队的法案，为期三年。*

The high esprit de corps of the Confederates was elevated by their victory. For the North, which had supremacy in numbers, it increased their caution. Seven long months passed before McClellan agreed to fight. Meanwhile, Lincoln was growing impatient at the timidity of his generals.
南方联盟军的高度士气, 因他们的胜利而得到提升。对于数量上占优势的北方来说，这增加了他们的谨慎。*漫长的七个月过去了，麦克莱伦才同意参战。与此同时，林肯对他的将军们的胆怯越来越不耐烦。*

In many ways, the Civil War represented a transition from the old style of fighting to the new style. During Bull Run and other early engagements, traditional uniformed lines of troops faced off, each trying to outflank the other. As the war progressed, new weapons and tactics changed warfare forever. There were no civilian spectators during the destructive battles to come.
**从很多方面来说，内战代表了从旧的战斗方式, 到新的战斗方式的转变。**在布尔朗和其他早期交战中，传统的制服部队对峙，双方都试图从侧翼包抄对方。**随着战争的进展，新的武器和战术永远改变了战争。**在接下来的破坏性战斗中没有平民观众。

== Battle of Antietam 安蒂特姆之战

The Civil War was fought with awe-inspiring passion.
内战是在令人敬畏的激情中进行的。

On the Union side, President Lincoln believed that failure to preserve the Union was a betrayal of the founders of the republic and the promise of the Declaration of Independence. He would not see it "perish from this earth."
在联邦方面，林肯总统认为，未能维护联邦, 就是对共和国创始人和《独立宣言》承诺的背叛。他(指林肯)绝不会看到它“从地球上消失”。

Passions raged as hot in the South. Like Lincoln, Jefferson Davis also believed in the Declaration of Independence. He insisted that governments existed with the consent of the governed. Northern interference with popular Southern law was an affront to this ideals.
在南方，激情同样炽热。和林肯一样，杰斐逊·戴维斯(南方邦联的总统)也相信《独立宣言》。他坚持认为政府的存在必须得到被统治者的同意。北方对南方流行法律的干涉, 是对这一理想的侮辱。


ROBERT E. LEE, who did not favor secession, felt that the North was seeking to wrest from the South its dearest rights.
"罗伯特·E·李"不赞成分裂国家，他认为北方正在寻求从南方夺取其最珍贵的权利。


Many Southerners believed the Northern position was an outright attack on the Southern way of life. They observed that the poverty suffered by Northern industrial workers created living conditions worse than those endured by Southern slaves. They also cited the Bible in defense of plantation life.
许多南方人认为, 北方的立场是对南方生活方式的公然攻击。他们观察到，北方工业工人因贫困造成的生活条件, 比南方奴隶的生活条件还要差。他们还引用圣经来捍卫种植园生活。

Southern legalists believed that the North was undermining the original intent of the Founding Fathers. The cornerstone of the American system was the state government, for which Confederates believed the Northerners had little respect.
南方法家认为, 北方正在破坏开国元勋的初衷。美国制度的基石是"州政府"，南方邦联认为, 北方人对"州政府"缺乏尊重。


South was on the move.
南方正在行动。

In August 1862, a Confederate Army invaded Kentucky fromTennesseeKentucky Tennessee. They seized FRANKFORT and seated a Confederate governor. During that same month, Robert E. Lee's ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA had defeated the Union Army again at the SECOND BATTLE OF BULL RUN.
1862 年 8 月，南方联盟军队从"田纳西州", 入侵"肯塔基州"。他们占领了法兰克福, 并任命了一位南部邦联州长。同月，罗伯特·E·李的北弗吉尼亚陆军, 在第二次"奔牛战役"中再次击败了联邦军。

Lee and Jefferson Davis believed that one more successful campaign might bring British and French recognition of the Confederacy. Foreign powers are reluctant to enter a conflict on the losing side. Although Britain and France both saw advantages of a split United States, neither country was willing to support the Confederacy without being convinced the South could win. Lee and Davis were desperately seeking that decisive victory.
李将军和杰佛逊·戴维斯相信，*一场更成功的军事上的战役, 可能会让英国和法国承认南方邦联。外国势力不愿意站在失败者一方。尽管英国和法国都看到了"美国分裂"对它们的好处，但在没有确信南方能够获胜的情况下，这两个国家都不愿意支持邦联。因此, 李和戴维斯, 拼命地寻求决定性的军事胜利。(即成王败寇, 用事实说话)*

Lee wanted to attack the North on its own territory. His target was the federal rail center at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but the Union General George McClellan was pursuing him. Lee decided to stop and confront the Union Army at SHARPSBURG, Maryland. In front of the town ran a little creek called Antietam.
李想在北方自己的领土上来攻击北方。他的目标是宾夕法尼亚州"哈里斯堡"的联邦铁路中心，但联邦将军"乔治·麦克莱伦"正在追击他。李决定在马里兰州"夏普斯堡"停下来, 与联邦军对峙。镇前有一条小溪，名叫安蒂特姆（Antietam）。

.Battle of Antietam 安蒂特姆战役
是1862年9月17日, 发生在华盛顿郡的马里兰会战中的一场战役。两军合计约损失23,000人，是美国史上最血腥的“一日战役”。北军获得战略上的胜利，阻止南军"北维吉尼亚军团"入侵"马里兰州"，但是，北军波多马克军团也损失惨重，因此罗伯特·李得以撤回维吉尼亚州。 +
image:/img/055.png[,30%]

战后，由于北军阻止南军继续北进，林肯总统因此决定发表解放奴隶宣言。


====


This day sits in history as the bloodiest single day America has ever suffered. Over 22,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing — more than all such casualties during the entire American Revolution. Lee lost a quarter of his army; the survivors headed back to Virginia the next night.
这一天被载入史册，成为美国遭受过的最血腥的一天。超过 22,000 名士兵阵亡、受伤或失踪——比整个美国革命期间的所有此类伤亡人数还要多。李损失了四分之一的军队；第二天晚上，幸存者返回弗吉尼亚。

The horror of Antietam proved to be one of the war's critical events. Lee and Davis did not get their victory. Neither Britain nor France was prepared to recognize the Confederacy. Five days after the battle, Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. On November 5, Lincoln, impatient with McClellan's hesitancy, relieved him of command, and replaced him with GENERAL AMBROSE BURNSIDE.
安提特姆的之战, 被证明是这场内战的关键事件之一。李和戴维斯没有获得胜利。英国和法国都不准备承认南部邦联。战斗结束五天后，林肯发布了初步的《解放奴隶宣言》。 11 月 5 日，林肯对"麦克莱伦"的犹豫不决感到不耐烦，解除了他的指挥权，并由"安布罗斯·伯恩赛德"将军取而代之。

Antietam changed everything.
安提坦改变了一切。

== 南北方的著名将领

The battles that caused the loss of so much life in the Civil War were the results of decisions made by the military commanders of the North and the South. Who were these people? Why did they order the kinds of attacks that characterized this war? How could they follow orders that in many cases seemed like sheer suicide? Many of the opposing officers were actually friends, who had been classmates at West Point and having fought at each other's sides in the US-MEXICAN WAR OF 1848.
南北战争中造成如此多人员伤亡的战斗是南北军事指挥官决策的结果。这些人是谁？他们为什么要发动这场战争所特有的攻击行动？他们怎么能服从在许多情况下看起来纯粹是自杀的命令呢？许多敌对军官实际上是朋友，他们曾是西点军校的同学，并在 1848 年的美墨战争中并肩作战。

Robert E. Lee was offered the position of commander in chief of the Union Army by President Lincoln before Virginia seceded from the United States. Lee was born into one of the South's most prominent families, and was the son of a Revolutionary War hero. His wife was the granddaughter of Martha Washington.
在弗吉尼亚脱离美国之前，林肯总统邀请"罗伯特·E·李"担任联邦军队总司令。李出生于南方最显赫的家庭之一，是革命战争英雄的儿子。他的妻子是"玛莎·华盛顿"(美国首任总统乔治·华盛顿的妻子)的孙女。

李在情感上反对南方脱离，然而他因效忠于出生地弗吉尼亚而加入南方联盟国。
====


Lee did not favor either slavery or secession, but joined the Confederate army out of duty to Virginia, which he would not dishonor. Although he was the unquestioned military leader of the South, he was not given charge of the entire Confederate Army until the war's outcome had already been decided. He was a brilliant military strategist, continually outsmarting and defeating opponents with armies much larger than his own.
李既不赞成奴隶制, 也不赞成分裂国家，但出于对弗吉尼亚的职责, 而加入了南方邦联军队，他不会羞辱弗吉尼亚。*尽管他是南方无可争议的军事领袖，但在战争结果确定之前，他并没有被任命为整个南方联盟军队的负责人。他是一位出色的军事战略家，不断智取并击败拥有比自己大得多的军队的对手。*


Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson was an intensely religious man. A former teacher at Virginia Military Institute, he believed the Southern cause was sacred. He was totally fearless in battle. He would drive troops to the point of total exhaustion, seemingly insensitive to their hardship and suffering.
托马斯·“石墙”·杰克逊是一位虔诚的宗教人士。作为弗吉尼亚军事学院的前教师，他相信南方事业是神圣的。他在战斗中完全无所畏惧。他会把部队逼到精疲力竭的地步，似乎对他们的艰辛和苦难不敏感。

After Jackson won five battles in one month, an aura of invincibility surrounded him. It lasted until his death, in the spring of 1863, during one of his most dramatic victories, the BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE.
杰克逊在一个月内赢得五场战斗后，一种所向无敌的光环围绕着他。这种状态一直持续到他于 1863 年春天去世，那是他在"切勒斯维尔战役"中取得的最戏剧性的胜利之一。

The Union had outstanding officers, but for the first three years of the war, the Union Army had five different commanders. As Lincoln grew impatient with each one's caution or inflexibility, he'd replace him. They simply did not win the decisive battle that Lincoln needed. ULYSSES S. GRANT was chosen as the general who could finish the job. He had fought in the US-Mexican War and won battles at FORT HENRY and FORT DONELSON in Tennessee during the winter of 1862. Grant had also led the Union troops during the pivotal VICKSBURG VICTORY.
**北方联邦也拥有出色的军官，但在战争的头三年里，联邦军队有五位不同的指挥官。当林肯对每个人的谨慎或僵化感到不耐烦时，他将替换他们。他们根本没有赢得林肯所需要的决定性战斗。尤利西斯·S·格兰特, 被选为能够完成这项工作的将军。**他曾参加过美墨战争，并于 1862 年冬季赢得了田纳西州亨利堡, 和多纳尔森堡的战斗。格兰特还在关键的维克斯堡胜利期间, 领导了联邦军队。

.案例

.Ulysses S. Grant 尤利西斯·S·格兰特

image:/img/Ulysses S. Grant.jpg[,30%]

是1869至1877年当上第18任美国总统的军官兼政治家。他还是美国陆军总司令，在之前1865年率联邦军赢得南北战争，后短暂担任战争部长。

1861年南北战争爆发后他加入联邦军，在西部战场参与多次胜利战事后打响名气。 +
格兰特与罗伯特·E·李在伤亡惨重的陆路战役和彼得斯堡围城战持续交手达13个月，李逃往彼得斯堡后又在阿波马托克斯败给格兰特，走投无路下于1865年4月9日正式投降。

格兰特出于责任感入伍，是南北战争最耀眼的英雄，在共和党一致推举下当选总统。推动批准第十五条宪法修正案. 对公务员制度的推动超越过去任何总统。

格兰特是“天生熟练掌握战术和战略”的现代将领和领导人，历史声誉在历任总统一度排名靠后，但进入21世纪后提升显著，2018年升至第21位，2021年第20位。现代史学家批评他任内丑闻频发，但更重视他执政八年的成果，如起诉三K党、保障非裔人权和公民权、原住民政策创新、和平解决“亚拉巴马号”索赔案和1876年大选之争。
====

For his strategy in those battles, he earned the nickname "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER" GRANT. After he became commander in chief of the Union Army, he doggedly pursued Lee. Grant fought Lee measure for measure and continued to advance, even as Union casualties soared and despite suffering great criticism for those losses.
由于他在这些战斗中的策略，他赢得了“无条件投降”的绰号(丹瑙森要塞之战是美国南北战争中北军第一次真正的完胜，格兰特那个无条件投降的要求让他名声远扬，成为英雄。从此他的名字首字母US, 就被解释为'无条件投降' Unconditional Surrender)。当他成为联邦军总司令后，他顽强地追击李。格兰特与李逐一作战并继续前进，尽管联邦伤亡人数激增，尽管这些损失受到了严厉批评。



Grant's most trusted officer, WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN, had fought with Grant earlier in the war. Sherman's job was to take Atlanta, an action that was a key part of Lincoln's strategy to conclude the war.
格兰特最信任的军官"威廉·特库姆塞·谢尔曼", 在战争早期曾与格兰特并肩作战。谢尔曼的任务是占领亚特兰大，这一行动是林肯结束战争战略的关键部分。

是美国南北战争中的北军将领，以火烧亚特兰大和“向大海进军”战略, 而获得“魔鬼将军”的绰号，曾与尤利西斯·辛普森·格兰特将军制定“东西战线协同作战”计划。

谢尔曼将军因于南北战争期间, 在南方实施"坚壁清野"政策，因而受到美国南部军民的强烈舆论抨击与反感。
====


Sherman was a nervous, talkative master strategist, who understood how difficult the war was going to be to win. He felt that the North would have to make life very difficult on civilians in the South in order to weaken the resolve of the Confederate Army. His ruthless and destructive drives across the South — first to Atlanta, then to the sea at Savannah, and finally through South Carolina, are his legacy.
谢尔曼是一位紧张、健谈的战略大师，他知道赢得战争有多么困难。他认为，北方必须让南方平民的生活变得非常困难，才能削弱南方邦联军队的决心。他无情且具有破坏性地驾车穿越南方——首先到达亚特兰大，然后到达萨凡纳的海边，最后穿过南卡罗来纳州，这是他的遗产。

== 葛底斯堡 Battle of Gettysburg


Robert E. Lee had a vision.
罗伯特·E·李有一个愿景。

He proposed to take the offensive, invade Pennsylvania, and defeat the Union Army in its own territory. Such a victory would relieve Virginia of the burden of war, strengthen the hand of PEACE DEMOCRATS in the North, and undermine Lincoln's chances for reelection. It would reopen the possibility for European support that was closed at Antietam. And perhaps, it would even lead to peace.
*他提议采取攻势，入侵宾夕法尼亚州，并在北方自己的领土上击败联邦军。这样的胜利, 将减轻弗吉尼亚的战争负担，增强北方和平民主党的影响力，并削弱林肯连任的机会。它将重新开启"因在安提坦之战败, 而关闭了的欧洲支持"的可能性。也许，这甚至会带来和平。*

The result of this vision was the largest battle ever fought on the North American continent. This was GETTYSBURG, where more than 170,000 fought and over 40,000 were casualties.
*这一愿景的结果是, 带来了北美大陆有史以来规模最大的一场战斗。这里是葛底斯堡，超过 17 万人参与战斗，伤亡超过 4 万人。*

Few Confederates made it. Lee's attempt for a decisive victory in Pennsylvania had failed. He had lost 28,000 troops — one-third of his army. A month later, he offered his resignation to Jefferson Davis, which was refused. Meade had lost 23,000 soldiers.
很少有同盟者成功。李在宾夕法尼亚州取得决定性胜利的尝试失败了。他损失了 28,000 名士兵——三分之一的军队。一个月后，他向杰斐逊·戴维斯提出辞职，但遭到拒绝。米德阵亡了 23,000 名士兵。

The hope for Southern recognition by any foreign government was dashed. The war continued for two more years, but Gettysburg marked the end of Lee's major offensives. The Confederacy tottered toward its defeat.
*令外国政府承认南方的希望破灭了。战争又持续了两年，但葛底斯堡标志着李的主要攻势的结束。南方邦联摇摇欲坠地走向失败。*

.Battle of Gettysburg 葛底斯堡战役
葛底斯堡战役 Battle of Gettysburg，1863年7月1日至7月3日, 于宾夕法尼亚州"葛底斯堡"及其附近地区爆发，是南北战争中最血腥的一场战斗，**经常被引以为美国内战的转捩点。**此役是由北方联邦军"乔治·米德"少将所率领之"波托马克军团", 抵挡由南方邦联军的"罗伯特·李"将军所部"北弗吉尼亚军团"之进攻，获得决定性胜利，*终结了李将军第二次、也是最后一次入侵美国北方各州的军事行动。*

南方邦联军的"罗伯特·李"将军率所部"北弗吉尼亚军团", 于"钱瑟勒斯维尔战役"击败北方联邦军"波托马克军团"后不久，*李将军决定二次北侵。此一行动可打乱联邦计划中的夏日选举，可能帮助被围于"密西西比维克斯堡"的守军脱困，并使南军就食于边界之外的北方丰饶农场，以让饱受战火蹂躏的弗吉尼亚州, 获得必要的休养生息。李将军所部, 可同时威胁宾夕法尼亚州的费城、马里兰州的巴尔的摩, 以及华盛顿特区，并鼓动此刻正于北方成长中的和平运动。*

Only one day after their victory at Gettysburg, Union forces captured Vicksburg, the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. Lincoln and Union commanders began to make plans for finishing the war.
在葛底斯堡获胜仅一天后，联邦军队就占领了密西西比河上最后一个南部邦联据点"维克斯堡"。林肯和联邦指挥官开始制定结束战争的计划。

The Union strategy to win the war did not emerge all at once. By 1863, however, the Northern military plan consisted of five major goals:
*北方联邦赢得战争的战略, 并不是一下子就出现的。然而，到 1863 年，北方军事计划包含五个主要目标：*

1.Fully blockade all Southern coasts. This strategy, known as the ANACONDA PLAN, would eliminate the possibility of Confederate help from abroad.
*全面封锁南部海岸。这一战略被称为“蟒蛇计划”，将消除南方邦联从国外获得帮助的可能性。*

2.Control the Mississippi River. The river was the South's major inland waterway. Also, Northern control of the rivers would separate Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas from the other Confederate states.
*控制密西西比河。这条河是南方主要的内陆水道。此外，北方对河流的控制, 能使德克萨斯州、路易斯安那州, 和阿肯色州, 与其他南部邦联各州分开。*

3.Capture RICHMOND. Without its capital, the Confederacy's command lines would be disrupted.
*占领南方邦联的首都"里士满"。没有首都，南部邦联的指挥线就会被打乱。*

4.Shatter Southern civilian morale by capturing and destroying ATLANTA, SAVANNAH, and the heart of Southern secession, South Carolina.
*占领并摧毁亚特兰大、萨凡纳, 以及南方分裂国家的中心"南卡罗来纳州"，粉碎南方平民的士气。*

5.Use the numerical advantage of Northern troops to engage the enemy everywhere to break the spirits of the Confederate Army.
利用北方军队的数量优势，与各地敌人交战，瓦解南方联盟军的士气。




By early 1864, the first two goals had been accomplished. The blockade had successfully prevented any meaningful foreign aid. General Ulysses Grant's success at Vicksburg delivered the Mississippi River to the Union. Lincoln turned to Grant to finish the job and, in the spring of 1864, appointed Grant to command the entire Union Army.
到 1864 年初，前两个目标已经实现。封锁成功地阻止了任何有意义的外国援助。尤利西斯·格兰特将军在维克斯堡的胜利将密西西比河交给了联邦。林肯请格兰特来完成这项工作，并于 1864 年春任命格兰特指挥整个联邦军队。

Grant had a plan to end the war by November. He mounted several major simultaneous offensives. General George Meade was to lead the Union's massive Army of the Potomac against Robert E. Lee. Grant would stay with Meade, who commanded the largest Northern army. GENERAL JAMES BUTLER was to advance up the JAMES RIVER in Virginia and attack Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy. General William Tecumseh Sherman was to plunge into the heart of the South, inflicting as much damage as he could against their war resources.
格兰特计划在 11 月之前结束战争。他同时发动了几场重大攻势。乔治·米德将军将率领联邦庞大的波托马克军团对抗罗伯特·E·李。格兰特将留在米德身边，后者指挥着北方最大的军队。詹姆斯·巴特勒将军将沿弗吉尼亚州的詹姆斯河挺进，进攻南部邦联首府里士满。威廉·特库姆塞·谢尔曼将军将深入南方腹地，对他们的战争资源造成尽可能多的破坏。

William Tecumseh Sherman
One week after Abraham Lincoln's reelection in 1864, William Tecumseh Sherman (above) began his merciless march through Georgia, leaving nothing behind but civilian sorrow and scorched earth. Both Atlanta and Savannah would fall back to Union control during this campaign.
1864 年亚伯拉罕·林肯 (Abraham Lincoln) 连任一周后，威廉·特库姆塞·谢尔曼 (William Tecumseh Sherman)（上图）开始了他在佐治亚州的无情行军，除了平民的悲伤和焦土之外，什么也没留下。亚特兰大和萨凡纳都将在本次竞选期间重新回到联邦控制之下。
Meade faced Lee's army in Virginia. Lee's strategy was to use terrain and fortified positions to his advantage, thus decreasing the importance of the Union's superiority in numbers. He hoped to make the cost of trying to force the South back into the Union so high that the Northern public would not stand for it. He almost accomplished this. From May 5 to May 24, the full force of Grant's and Lee's armies fought continually with enormous casualties.
米德在弗吉尼亚面对李的军队。李的策略是利用地形和防御工事来发挥自己的优势，从而降低联邦在数量上的优势的重要性。他希望迫使南方重返联邦的成本如此之高，以至于北方公众无法忍受。他几乎完成了这件事。从5月5日到5月24日，格兰特和李的军队全力作战，伤亡惨重。

But, unlike the Union commanders of the past, Grant had the determination to press on despite the cost. Twenty-eight thousand soldiers were casualties of the BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS. A few days later, another 28,000 soldiers were casualties in the BATTLE OF SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE. More than two-thirds of the casualties of these battles were Union soldiers.
但是，与过去的联邦指挥官不同的是，格兰特有决心不顾代价继续前进。荒野之战共有两万八千名士兵伤亡。几天后，斯波特西瓦尼亚法院之战又有 28,000 名士兵伤亡。这些战斗中超过三分之二的伤亡者是联邦士兵。

At COLD HARBOR the following week, Grant lost another 13,000 soldiers — 7,000 of them in half an hour. In the 30 days that Grant had been fighting Lee, he lost 50,000 troops — a number equal to half the size of the Confederate army at the time. As a result, Grant became known as "THE BUTCHER." Congress was appalled and petitioned for his removal. But Lincoln argued that Grant was winning the battles and refused to grant Congress's request.
接下来的一周，格兰特在冷港又损失了 13,000 名士兵——半小时内就损失了 7,000 名士兵。在格兰特与李作战的 30 天里，他损失了 50,000 名士兵——这个数字相当于当时南方邦联军队规模的一半。结果，格兰特被称为“屠夫”。国会感到震惊并请愿将他免职。但林肯辩称格兰特正在赢得战斗，并拒绝批准国会的请求。

March to the sea
William T. Sherman's ruthless march through the South to the sea drove a stake into the heart of the Confederacy. He left nothing in his wake, destroying everything in sight in an attempt to crush the rebellion once and for all.
威廉·谢尔曼（William T. Sherman）残酷地从南方进军到海边，将一根木桩插进了南部邦联的中心。他没有留下任何东西，摧毁了眼前的一切，试图一劳永逸地镇压叛乱。
Butler failed to capture Richmond, and the Confederate capital was temporarily spared. On May 6, one day after Grant and Lee started their confrontation in the Wilderness, Sherman entered Georgia, scorching whatever resources that lay in his path. By late July, he had forced the enemy back to within sight of Atlanta. For a month, he lay siege to the city. Finally, in early September he entered Atlanta — one day after the Confederate army evacuated it.
巴特勒未能占领里士满，南部邦联首都暂时幸免。 5 月 6 日，格兰特和李在荒野中开始对抗的一天后，谢尔曼进入佐治亚州，烧毁了路上的所有资源。到七月下旬，他已将敌人逼回到亚特兰大的视线范围内。他围攻这座城市一个月。最后，九月初，他进入亚特兰大——在南部邦联军队撤离的第二天。

Sherman waited until seven days after Lincoln's hotly fought reelection before putting Atlanta to the torch and starting his MARCH TO THE SEA. No one stood before him. His soldiers pillaged the countryside and destroyed everything of conceivable military value as they traveled 285 miles to Savannah in a march that became legendary for the misery it created among the civilian population. On December 22, Savannah fell.
谢尔曼等到林肯激烈竞选连任后第七天，才点燃亚特兰大的火炬，开始他的出海进军。没有人站在他面前。他的士兵在行军 285 英里前往萨凡纳时，掠夺了乡村，摧毁了一切具有军事价值的东西，这场行军因其给平民带来的痛苦而成为传奇。 12月22日，萨凡纳陷落。

Next, Sherman ordered his army to move north into South Carolina. Their intent was to destroy the state where secession began. Exactly a month later, its capital, Columbia, fell to him. On the same day, Union Forces retook Fort Sumter.
接下来，谢尔曼命令他的军队向北进入南卡罗来纳州。他们的目的是摧毁分裂开始的国家。整整一个月后，其首都哥伦比亚落入他手中。同一天，联邦军队重新夺回萨姆特堡。

The war was almost over.
战争快结束了。
