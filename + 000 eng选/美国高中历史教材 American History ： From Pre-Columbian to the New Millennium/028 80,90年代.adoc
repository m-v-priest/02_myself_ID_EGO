=== The Reagan Years 里根时代 (1980年代)

Americans were fed up.

[.my2]
美国人已经厌倦了。

In 1980, confidence in the American economy and government hit rock bottom. +
Looking for a change and the promise of a better future, voters turned to RONALD REAGAN for answers.
1980年，人们对美国经济和政府的信心跌至谷底。为了寻求变革和更美好未来的希望，选民向罗纳德·里根寻求答案。

.Ronald Wilson Reagan 罗纳德·里根

image:/img/Official_Portrait_of_President_Reagan_1981.jpg[,20%]


第40任美国总统（1981年－1989年）.

里根推行的经济政策为供应面经济学，被人称为"里根经济学". +
也被称为"trickle-down economics 涓滴效应学 "（不进行财富再分配，而是反过来使有钱人更富有，大企业随后大量花费及投资，使社会各阶层皆获益）.

.trickle-down economics : 下渗经济学 /涓滴经济学
用于描述给富人及企业减税, 可惠及所有人包括贫苦大众的经济政策.

*该主张认为, 政府对富人阶级减免税收, 与向企业提供经济上的优待政策，将可改善经济整体，最终会使社会中的贫困阶层人民也得到生活上的改善。*

该主张反对以"征税手段"来减少社会中的贫富差距，也往往削减对贫穷阶层进行社会救助。

但这也会导致社会贫富差距扩大.

**美国经济在历经1981－1982年的急剧衰退后，于1982年开始了非常茁壮的经济成长，到他任期结束并一直持续。**

**他始终强调他对于"联邦政府在处理问题上的能力"抱持着怀疑态度，尤其是在经济问题方面。**他的解决方式是撤回政府的干涉吗并减少税率和商业管制，以此让自由市场机制能自动修正所面临的问题。他在就职典礼那天曾说过：“*政府并不是解决问题的方法，政府本身才是问题所在。*"

里根在政治意识形态上, 贯彻了反共主义与民主资本主义。*1989年, "里根"离任时的支持率为68%，使他同"富兰克林·罗斯福", 及之后的"比尔·克林顿", 并列成为近现代史上"离任时拥有最高支持率"的总统。*
====

His message was clear. +
Government has become too big and needs to be trimmed down to size. +
Taxes are insanely high and need to be cut to stimulate growth and investment. +
Military spending should be increased to fix the degenerating state of the American war machine. +
Morality and character need to be reemphasized in American life. +
The United States is still the largest superpower in the world with the best system of government. +
It's time to feel good about being an American again.

[.my2]
他的信息很明确。政府已经变得太大，需要缩减规模。税收非常高，需要削减以刺激增长和投资。应该增加军费开支，以修复美国战争机器日益恶化的状况。在美国生活中, 需要重新强调道德和品格。美国仍然是世界上最大的超级大国，拥有最好的政府体系。是时候再次为自己成为一名美国人而感到高兴了。


Reagan's election brought a dramatic change to the federal government. +
No president, Republican or Democrat, had attempted to reduce the size of the federal government since Franklin Roosevelt initiated his New Deal. +
The tax cut that was handed to the American people benefited wealthy Americans most, with the hope that their increased income would trickle down to poorer Americans — the so-called trickle-down theory. +
The economic stagnation of the 1970s did come to an end, but at the cost of huge federal deficits and the increasing poverty rate.
*里根的当选, 给联邦政府带来了巨大的变化。自富兰克林·罗斯福发起新政以来，没有一位总统，无论是共和党还是民主党，试图缩小联邦政府的规模。给予美国人民的减税政策, 使富裕的美国人受益最多，他们希望他们增加的收入能够惠及较贫穷的美国人——即所谓的"涓滴理论"。 20 世纪 70 年代的经济停滞确实结束了，但代价是巨额联邦赤字, 和不断上升的贫困率。*

The 1980s were a decade of scandals. +
The Iran-Contra Scandal proved that White House officials were willing to break the law to carry out their political agenda. +
Religious leaders like JIM BAKKER and JIMMY SWAGGERT became mired in dirty sex scandals. +
Moral turpitude ended the political career of Colorado Democrat GARY HART, who might well have been president one day. +
A SAVINGS AND LOAN SCAM fleeced American taxpayers for billions and billions of bailout dollars.
20 世纪 80 年代是丑闻频发的十年。伊朗门丑闻证明，白宫官员愿意违法以执行其政治议程。吉姆·巴克（JIM BAKKER）和吉米·斯瓦格特（JIMMY SWAGGERT）等宗教领袖陷入了肮脏的性丑闻。道德败坏结束了科罗拉多州民主党人加里·哈特的政治生涯，他很可能有一天会成为总统。储蓄和贷款骗局, 骗取了美国纳税人数十亿美元的救助资金。

As the decade came to a close, it became clear that the malaise of the 1970s was over. +
The United States received a boost of confidence when the Cold War came to an end in 1991. +
The menace of a threatening Soviet Union now belonged to history, and the United States claimed the status of the only remaining superpower in the world.
*随着这十年的结束，20 世纪 70 年代的不景气显然已经结束。* 1991年冷战结束后，美国的信心大增。苏联的威胁现在已成为历史，美国声称自己是世界上仅存的超级大国。

==== "Morning in America"  《美国的早晨》

The long national nightmare was over.

[.my2]
漫长的全国噩梦结束了。

The United States was filled with hard-working, God-fearing citizens who cared about their fellow Americans. +
Inflation and unemployment were problems of government, not the national character. +
Vietnam was over; America was the most powerful nation in the world. +
The Soviet Union was an evil empire. +
Old-fashioned initiative and ingenuity would maintain America's competitive edge in commerce.

[.my2]
美国充满了勤劳、敬畏上帝、关心美国同胞的公民。通货膨胀和失业, 是政府的问题，而不是国民的问题。越南战争结束了；美国是世界上最强大的国家。苏联是一个邪恶的帝国。传统价值观的"主动性"和"独创性", 将保持美国在商业上的竞争优势。

These themes soothed a nation sick with the malaise of the 1970s. +
When all had seemed lost, a grandfatherly figure stepped forth and optimistically reassured Americans that the age-old beliefs they held about the grandeur of the United States were not myths.

[.my2]
这些主题抚慰了这个饱受 20 世纪 70 年代萎靡不振之苦的国家。当一切似乎都已失去时，一位祖父般的人物挺身而出，乐观地向美国人保证，他们对美国伟大的古老信念并非神话。

This man, Ronald Wilson Reagan, understood the sprit of the times, and his message, personality, and politics dominated the 1980s.

[.my2]
罗纳德·威尔逊·里根这个人, 了解时代精神，他的信息、个性和政治主导了 20 世纪 80 年代。

Traditionally, working-class Americans, Southerners, Catholics, and urban dwellers had strong ties to the Democratic Party. +
The Republicans relied heavily on support from the rural Midwest, Protestant leaders, and wealthier voters. +
Ronald Reagan built a new coalition for the Republican Party in his quest for the Presidency in 1980.

[.my2]
传统上，美国工人阶级、南方人、天主教徒, 和城市居民, 与"民主党"有着密切的联系。而"共和党"则严重依赖中西部农村地区、新教领袖和富裕选民的支持。 1980 年，罗纳德·里根 (Ronald Reagan) 在竞选总统期间, 为"共和党"建立了一个新的联盟。



Working Americans were shocked to see unemployment rates nearing double digits. +
Inflation was pushing the middle class into tax brackets previously reserved for the affluent classes. +
Reagan promised to reduce their level of misery with sound fiscal policy. +
Southerners disgruntled by affirmative action and busing found friendly ears in the Reagan campaign. +
The endorsement of Reagan by the Protestant establishment did not deter devout Catholics from voting Republican, since Reagan promised to oppose abortion rights and promote family values.

[.my2]
美国工薪阶层震惊地发现, 失业率接近两位数。通货膨胀正在将中产阶级推入以前为富裕阶层保留的税级。里根承诺, 通过健全的财政政策, 来减少他们的痛苦。对平权行动和公车不满的南方人, 在里根竞选活动中找到了友好的倾听者。新教机构对里根的支持, 并没有阻止虔诚的天主教徒投票给共和党，因为里根承诺反对堕胎权并提倡家庭价值观。

Crime-plagued city denizens looked to Reagan for comfort as he portrayed himself as the law and order candidate. +
Americans across demographic lines were warmed by his promises for a stronger America domestically and overseas. +
Very quickly, these "REAGAN DEMOCRATS" crumbled the old alignment. +
Jimmy Carter, his opponent in the 1980 election, never stood a chance.

[.my2]
当里根将自己描绘成"法律与秩序候选人"时，饱受犯罪困扰的城市居民, 向里根寻求安慰。他在国内外打造"一个更强大的美国"的承诺, 让不同人口群体的美国人都感到温暖。很快，这些“里根民主党人”就瓦解了旧的联盟。 1980 年大选中, 他的对手吉米·卡特 (Jimmy Carter) 根本没有机会。

==== Reaganomics 59b.里根经济学


The media called it Reaganomics.

[.my2]
媒体称之为里根经济学。

During the campaign of 1980, Ronald Reagan announced a recipe to fix the nation's economic mess. +
He claimed an undue tax burden, excessive government regulation, and massive social spending programs hampered growth. +
Reagan proposed a phased 30% tax cut for the first three years of his Presidency. +
The bulk of the cut would be concentrated at the upper income levels. +
The economic theory behind the wisdom of such a plan was called SUPPLY-SIDE or TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS.
1980 年竞选期间，罗纳德·里根宣布了解决国家经济混乱的良方。*他声称，过度的税收负担、过度的政府监管, 和大规模的社会支出计划, 阻碍了经济增长。里根提议在其总统任期的前三年, 分阶段减税 30%。减税的大部分将集中在高收入阶层。这一计划背后的经济理论, 被称为“供给侧经济学”或“涓滴经济学”。*



Tax relief for the rich would enable them to spend and invest more. +
This new spending would stimulate the economy and create new jobs. +
Reagan believed that a tax cut of this nature would ultimately generate even more revenue for the federal government. +
The Congress was not as sure as Reagan, but they did approve a 25% cut during Reagan's first term.

[.my2]
对富人的税收减免, 将使他们能够增加支出和投资。这些新的支出, 将刺激经济, 并创造新的就业机会。里根相信，这种性质的减税, 最终将为联邦政府带来更多收入。国会不像里根那么确定，但他们确实在里根第一任期内批准了 25% 的削减。

The results of this plan were mixed. +
Initially, the FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD believed the tax cut would re-ignite inflation and raise interest rates. +
This sparked a deep recession in 1981 and 1982. +
The high interest rates caused the value of the dollar to rise on the international exchange market, making American goods more expensive abroad. +
As a result, exports decreased while imports increased. +
Eventually, the economy stabilized in 1983, and the remaining years of Reagan's administration showed national growth.
*这个计划的结果好坏参半。最初，美联储认为, "减税"将重新引发"通货膨胀", 并提高"利率"。这引发了1981年和1982年的严重衰退。"高利率"导致国际汇市上, 美元升值，使得美国商品在国外更加昂贵。结果，出口减少，而进口增加。最终，经济在 1983 年稳定下来，里根政府的剩余几年, 呈现出国家经济增长。*

The defense industry boomed as well. +
Reagan insisted that the United States was open to a "WINDOW OF VULNERABILITY" to the Soviet Union regarding nuclear defense. +
Massive government contracts were awarded to defense firms to upgrade the nation's military. +
Reagan even proposed a space-based missile defense system called the STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE. +
Scientists were dubious about the feasibility of a laser-guided system that could shoot down enemy missiles. +
Critics labeled the plan "STAR WARS."
国防工业也蓬勃发展。里根坚称，在核防御方面，美国对苏联敞开了“脆弱之窗”。大量政府合同被授予国防公司, 以升级国家军队。里根甚至提出了一种名为“战略防御计划”的天基导弹防御系统。科学家们对击落敌方导弹的激光制导系统的可行性, 表示怀疑。批评者称该计划为“星球大战”。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Star Wars Program星际大战计划 / Strategic Defense Initiative 战略防卫先制
是美国在1980年代研议的一个军事战略计划，目标为建造太空中的激光装置, 来作为反弹道导弹系统，使敌人的核弹在进入大气层前即被摧毁。
====

Budget deficits

Ronald Reagan's increased spending and accompanying tax cuts resulted in dramatic budget deficits during the 1980s. +
A deficit occurs when spending exceeds revenues in any year.

[.my2]
罗纳德·里根 (Ronald Reagan) **增加支出, 和随之而来的"减税", 导致 20 世纪 80 年代出现严重的"预算赤字"。**当任何一年的"支出"超过"收入"时，就会出现"赤字"。



Economists disagreed over the achievements of REAGANOMICS. +
Tax cuts plus increased military spending would cost the federal government trillions of dollars. +
Reagan advocated paying for these expenses by slashing government programs. +
In the end, the Congress approved his tax and defense plans, but refused to make any deep cuts to the welfare state. +
Even Reagan himself was squeamish about attacking popular programs like Social Security and MEDICARE, which consume the largest percentages of taxpayer dollars. +
The results were skyrocketing deficits.

[.my2]
经济学家对 REAGANOMICS 的成就, 意见不一。**"减税"加上"增加军费开支", 将使联邦政府损失数万亿美元。**里根主张通过削减政府项目, 来支付这些费用。最终，国会批准了他的税收和国防计划，但拒绝对福利国家进行任何大幅削减。就连里根本人, 也对攻击"社会保障"和"医疗保险"等受欢迎的项目, 感到不安，因为这些项目消耗了纳税人资金的最大比例。*结果是财政赤字飙升。*

The national debt tripled from one to three trillion dollars during the REAGAN YEARS. +
The President and conservatives in Congress cried for a balanced budget amendment, but neither branch had the discipline to propose or enact a balanced budget. +
The growth that Americans enjoyed during the 1980s came at a huge price for the generations to follow.
**里根执政期间，国家债务增加了两倍，**从一万亿美元, 增至三万亿美元。总统和国会中的保守派呼吁, 制定一项平衡的预算修正案，但两个部门都没有提出或颁布平衡预算的纪律。*美国人在 20 世纪 80 年代享受的经济增长, 让后代付出了巨大的代价。*

==== Foreign and Domestic Entanglements 国内外的纠葛 (抗'共产主义'斗士 -- 里根)


Ronald Reagan, Cold Warrior.

[.my2]
罗纳德·里根，冷战战士。


He believed the United States could ill afford to sit passively while communism expanded aggressively. +
He announced the REAGAN DOCTRINE, which pledged American support to "FREEDOM FIGHTERS" opposing Communism any where on the globe.

[.my2]
他认为，当共产主义积极扩张时，美国绝不能袖手旁观。他宣布了里根主义，承诺美国支持"全球任何地方反对共产主义的'自由战士'"。

'''

==== The End of the Cold War 冷战的结束


When Mikhail Gorbachev assumed the reins of power in the Soviet Union in 1985, no one predicted the revolution he would bring. +
A dedicated reformer, Gorbachev introduced the policies of glasnost and perestroika to the USSR.
1985 年米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫 (Mikhail Gorbachev) 在苏联掌权时，没有人预料到他会带来一场革命。戈尔巴乔夫是一位热心的改革家，他向苏联引入了开放和改革政策。

The unraveling of the SOVIET BLOC began in Poland in June 1989. +
Despite previous Soviet military interventions in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland itself, Polish voters elected a noncommunist opposition government to their legislature. +
The world watched with anxious eyes, expecting Soviet tanks to roll into Poland preventing the new government from taking power.

[.my2]
苏联集团的解体, 于 1989 年 6 月在波兰开始。尽管苏联此前对匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克, 和波兰本土, 进行了军事干预，但波兰选民还是选举了一个"非共产主义"的反对派政府, 进入其立法机构。全世界都焦急地注视着，期待着苏联坦克开进波兰，阻止新政府夺权。



Gorbachev, however, refused to act.

[.my2]
然而戈尔巴乔夫拒绝采取行动。

Like dominoes, Eastern European communist dictatorships fell one by one. +
By the fall of 1989, East and West Germans were tearing down the BERLIN WALL with pickaxes. +
Communist regimes were ousted in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. +
On Christmas Day, the brutal Romanian dictator NICOLAE CEAUSESCU and his wife were summarily executed on live television. +
Yugoslavia threw off the yoke of communism only to dissolve quickly into a violent civil war.

[.my2]
就像多米诺骨牌一样，东欧共产主义独裁政权一一倒塌。 1989 年秋天，东德和西德人用镐拆除了柏林墙。匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克的共产主义政权, 被推翻。圣诞节那天，残暴的罗马尼亚独裁者尼古拉·齐奥塞斯库, 和他的妻子, 在电视直播中被立即处决。南斯拉夫摆脱了共产主义的枷锁，但很快就陷入了暴力内战。

Demands for freedom soon spread to the Soviet Union. +
The BALTIC STATES of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania declared independence. +
Talks of similar sentiments were heard in UKRAINE, the CAUCASUS, and the CENTRAL ASIAN states. +
Here Gorbachev wished to draw the line. +
Self-determination for Eastern Europe was one thing, but he intended to maintain the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union. +
In 1991, he proposed a Union Treaty, giving greater autonomy to the Soviet republics, while keeping them under central control.

[.my2]
对自由的要求, 很快就蔓延到了苏联。波罗的海国家爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛, 宣布独立。乌克兰、高加索和中亚国家, 也表达了类似的看法。戈尔巴乔夫希望在此划清界限。东欧的自决是一回事，但他打算维护苏联的领土完整。 1991年，他提出了一项联盟条约，给予"苏维埃各加盟共和国"更大的自治权，同时将它们置于中央控制之下。


When Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power of the Soviet Union in 1985, he instituted the policies of glasnost and perestroika in hopes of sparking the sluggish economy. +
What resulted from this taste of freedom was the revolution that ended the Cold War.
1985年米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫(Mikhail Gorbachev)上台后，制定了开放和改革政策，希望能够提振低迷的经济。这种自由的滋味, 带来了"结束冷战"的革命。

That summer, a coup by conservative hardliners took place. +
Gorbachev was placed under house arrest. +
Meanwhile, BORIS YELTSIN, the leader of the RUSSIAN SOVIET REPUBLIC, demanded the arrest of the hardliners. +
The army and the public sided with Yeltsin, and the coup failed. +
Though Gorbachev was freed, he was left with little legitimacy.

[.my2]
那年夏天，保守派中的主张强硬路线的人, 发动了政变。戈尔巴乔夫被软禁。与此同时，俄罗斯苏维埃共和国领导人鲍里斯·叶利钦, 要求逮捕强硬派。军队和公众都站在叶利钦一边，保守派的政变失败了。尽管戈尔巴乔夫被释放，但他的合法性却微乎其微。

Nationalist leaders like Yeltsin were far more popular than he could hope to become. +
In December 1991, Ukraine, BYELORUSSIA, and RUSSIA itself declared independence and the Soviet Union was dissolved. +
Gorbachev was a president without a country.

[.my2]
像叶利钦这样的民族主义领导人, 比他所希望的更受欢迎。 1991年12月，乌克兰、白俄罗斯, 和俄罗斯本身, 宣布独立，苏联解体。戈尔巴乔夫是一位没有国家的总统。

Americans were pleasantly shocked, but shocked nonetheless at the turn of events in the Soviet bloc. +
No serious discourse on any diplomatic levels in the USSR addressed the likelihood of a Soviet collapse. +
Republicans were quick to claim credit for winning the Cold War. +
They believed the military spending policies of the Reagan-Bush years forced the Soviets to the brink of economic collapse. +
Democrats argued that containment of communism was a bipartisan policy for 45 years begun by the Democrat Harry Truman.

[.my2]
美国人感到惊喜不已，但对苏联集团事态的转变仍然感到震惊。苏联任何外交层面上, 都没有认真讨论过苏联解体的可能性。共和党人很快就赢得了冷战的胜利。**他们认为里根-布什时代的军费开支政策, 将苏联推向了经济崩溃的边缘。**民主党人认为，遏制共产主义, 是民主党人哈里·杜鲁门 (Harry Truman) 发起的 45 年来的两党政策。

Others pointed out that no one really won the Cold War. +
The United States spent trillions of dollars arming themselves for a direct confrontation with the Soviet Union that fortunately never came. +
Regardless, thousands of American lives were lost waging proxy wars in Korea and Vietnam.

[.my2]
其他人则指出，没有人真正赢得了冷战。美国花费数万亿美元武装自己，以便与苏联进行直接对抗，幸运的是，这种对抗从未发生。不管怎样，成千上万的美国人在朝鲜和越南的代理人战争中丧生。

Most Americans found it difficult to get used to the idea of no Cold War. +
Since 1945, Americans were born into a Cold War culture that featured McCarthyist witchhunts, backyard bomb shelters, a space race, a missile crisis, détente, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Star Wars defense proposal. +
Now the enemy was beaten, but the world remained unsafe. +
In many ways, facing one superpower was simpler than challenging dozens of rogue states and renegade groups sponsoring global terrorism.

[.my2]
大多数美国人发现很难适应没有冷战的想法。自 1945 年以来，美国人诞生于冷战文化中，其中包括"麦卡锡主义"的政治迫害、后院防空洞、太空竞赛、导弹危机、缓和、苏联入侵阿富汗, 和星球大战防御提案。现在敌人已经被打败了，但是世界仍然不安全。从很多方面来说，面对一个超级大国, 要比挑战数十个支持全球恐怖主义的流氓国家和叛徒团体, 更简单。

Americans hoped against hope that the new world order of the 1990s would be marked with the security and prosperity to which they had become accustomed.

[.my2]
美国人满怀希望地希望,  20 世纪 90 年代的新世界秩序, 能够以他们已经习惯的安全和繁荣为标志。


'''

=== Toward a New Millennium 迈向新千年 (1990年代)

The last decade of the 20th century was marked with dizzying change for the United States. +
With the Soviet Union out of the picture, American diplomats sought to create a "NEW WORLD ORDER" based on democracy, free-market capitalism and the Western lifestyle.
20世纪最后十年对美国来说发生了令人目眩的变化。随着苏联的退出，美国外交官寻求建立一个基于民主、自由市场资本主义, 和西方生活方式的“新世界秩序”。

'''


==== Operation Desert Storm 沙漠风暴行动


The first major foreign crisis for the United States after the end of the Cold War presented itself in August 1990. +
Saddam Hussein, the dictator of Iraq, ordered his army across the border into tiny Kuwait. +
This was no ordinary act of aggression. +
Iraq's army was well equipped. +
The United States had provided massive military aid to Iraq during their eight-year war with Iran, giving them the fourth largest army in the world.
1990 年 8 月，美国遭遇了冷战结束后的第一次重大外交危机。**伊拉克独裁者萨达姆·侯赛因, 命令他的军队越过边境, 进入小国科威特。**这不是一次普通的侵略行为。伊拉克军队装备精良。在伊拉克与伊朗长达八年的战争期间，美国向伊拉克提供了大量军事援助，使他们拥有世界第四大军队。

Kuwait was a major supplier of oil to the United States. +
The Iraqi takeover posed an immediate threat to neighboring Saudi Arabia, another major exporter of oil. +
If Saudi Arabia fell to Saddam, Iraq would control one-fifth of the world's oil supply. +
All eyes were on the White House, waiting for a response. +
President Bush, who succeeded President Reagan, stated simply: "This will not stand."
**科威特是美国的主要石油供应国。伊拉克的接管, 对另一个主要石油出口国沙特阿拉伯, 构成了直接威胁。如果沙特阿拉伯落入萨达姆手中，伊拉克将控制世界五分之一的石油供应。** 所有人的目光都集中在白宫，等待回应。接替里根总统的布什总统简单地说：“这种未来不会存在。”


image:/img/097.png[,30%]


In the last months of 1990, the United States participated in the defense of Saudi Arabia in a deployment known as Operation Desert Shield. +
Over 500,000 American troops were placed in Saudi Arabia in case of an Iraqi attack on the Saudis. +
The U.S. +
further sought multilateral support in the United Nations Security Council. +
Traditionally, Iraq was an ally of the Soviet Union, who held a veto power over any potential UN military action. +
Looking westward for support for their dramatic internal changes, the USSR did not block the American plan. +
The UN condemned Iraq and helped form a coalition to fight Saddam militarily.
1990 年的最后几个月，美国参与了一项名为“沙漠盾牌行动”的部署来保卫"沙特阿拉伯"。超过50万美军被部署在沙特阿拉伯，以防"伊拉克"袭击"沙特"。**美国进一步寻求"联合国安理会"的多边支持。传统上，伊拉克是苏联的盟友，苏联对联合国任何潜在的军事行动拥有否决权。** 但苏联当时正在向西寻求对其内部剧烈变革的支持，并没有阻止美国的计划。联合国谴责伊拉克, 并帮助组建了军事打击萨达姆的联盟。

Bush, remembering the lessons of Vietnam, sought public support as well. +
Although there were scant opponents of the conflict, the vast majority of Americans and a narrow majority of the Congress supported the President's actions. +
When all the forces were in place, the United States issued an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein: leave Kuwait by January 15,1991 or face a full attack by the multinational force.
**老布什总统牢记越南的教训，也寻求公众支持。**尽管反对这场冲突的人很少，但绝大多数美国人, 和国会的微弱多数, 支持总统的行动。当所有部队就位后，美国向萨达姆发出最后通牒：在1991年1月15日之前离开"科威特"，否则将面临多国部队的全面攻击。


January 15 came and went with no response from the Iraqis. +
The next night Desert Shield became Desert Storm. +
Bombing sorties pummeled Iraq's military targets for the next several weeks. +
On many days there were over 2500 such missions. +
Iraq responded by launching Scud missiles at American military barracks in Saudi Arabia and Israel. +
Attacking Israel was a stratagem to persuade all the neighboring Arab nations to join the Iraqi cause. +
After intense diplomatic pressure and negotiation, the Arab nations remained in opposition to Iraq.
1 月 15 日过去了，伊拉克人没有任何回应。第二天晚上，"沙漠之盾"变成了"沙漠风暴"。接下来的几周里，伊拉克的军事目标遭到轰炸。在很多天里，此类任务超过 2500 次。*伊拉克的回应是向美国驻沙特阿拉伯和以色列的军营, 发射飞毛腿导弹。攻击以色列, 是说服所有阿拉伯邻国加入伊拉克事业的策略。经过激烈的外交压力和谈判，阿拉伯国家仍然反对伊拉克。*

On February 24, the ground war began. +
Although the bombing lasted for weeks, American ground troops declared Kuwait liberated just 100 hours after the ground attack was initiated. +
American foot soldiers moved through Kuwait and entered southern Iraq. +
This posed a dilemma for the United States. +
The military objectives were complete, but Saddam, the perpetrator of the unprovoked invasion of Kuwait, was still ruling Iraq from Baghdad. +
President Bush feared that the allies would not support the occupation of Baghdad. +
Concerns were raised that if Saddam's regime were toppled, the entire nation could disintegrate into a civil war. +
Soon Iraq agreed to terms for a ceasefire, and the conflict subsided.
2月24日，地面战争开始。尽管轰炸持续了数周，但美国地面部队在地面攻击发起仅 100 小时后, 就宣布"科威特"解放。*美国步兵穿过科威特, 进入伊拉克南部。这给美国带来了两难的境地。军事目标已经完成，但无端入侵科威特的萨达姆, 仍在巴格达统治伊拉克。布什总统担心盟国不会支持占领巴格达。人们担心，如果萨达姆政权被推翻，整个国家可能会陷入内战。很快伊拉克同意停火条款，冲突平息。*



Iraq did not leave Kuwait untouched. +
Millions of dollars of valuables were plundered by the occupying troops. +
As Iraq retreated, they detonated explosives at many of Kuwait's oil wells. +
The disaster to the environment grew as Iraq dumped oil into the Persian Gulf. +
The costs were enormous, and casualty figure staggering. +
Although estimates range in the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths, only 148 Americans were killed in the battle. +
This was primarily because of the technological advances of the United States.

[.my2]
伊拉克也没有放过科威特。数百万美元的贵重物品被占领军掠夺。当伊拉克撤退时，他们在科威特的许多油井, 引爆了炸药。随着伊拉克向波斯湾倾倒石油，环境灾难愈演愈烈。损失巨大，伤亡数字惊人。尽管估计有数十万伊拉克人死亡，但只有 148 名美国人在战斗中丧生。这主要是因为美国的技术进步。

The United States passed its first test of the post-Cold War world. +
Skillful diplomacy proved that the United Nations could be used as an instrument of force when necessary. +
Although Moscow did not contribute troops to the operation, they gave tacit approval for the attack. +
The potential for multinational cooperation was demonstrated. +
The largest American military operation since Vietnam was completed with smashing success. +
Most Americans felt confident in their military and technological edge once more. +
President Bush promptly declared that the "new world order had begun."
**美国通过了冷战后世界的第一次考验。高超的外交手段证明，必要时可以利用联合国作为武力工具。**尽管莫斯科没有派兵参与此次行动，但他们默许了这次袭击。**跨国合作的潜力得到了体现。**自越南以来美国最大规模的军事行动取得了巨大成功。大多数美国人再次对自己的军事和技术优势充满信心。布什总统立即宣布“新的世界秩序已经开始”。

====  A Baby Boomer in the White House 白宫的婴儿潮一代总统


President Bush enjoyed an approval rating in March 1991 of 91 percent for his handling of Operation Desert Storm. +
As the Presidential race for 1992 began to unfold, many potential candidates were scared to challenge him and look to 1996 as a better opportunity. +
But the recession that battered the American economy would not go away. +

这两位候选人有着天壤之别。布什是二战英雄，拥有丰富的华盛顿经验，包括担任中央情报局局长、驻联合国大使，并担任过八年副总统。

Clinton was born after World War II and did not fight in Vietnam, so he faced constant charges of dodging the draft. +
He had no experience on the federal level of government; he simply was the popular governor of Arkansas. +

克林顿出生于二战后，没有参加过越南战争，因此他不断面临"逃避兵役"的指控。他没有在联邦政府一级工作的经验；他只是阿肯色州受欢迎的州长。在整个竞选过程中，克林顿接二连三地遭遇丑闻。电视上谈到了通奸指控。当 20 世纪 60 年代被指控吸食大麻时，克林顿承认了这一点，但补充说他没有吸过。关于“WHITEWATER”房地产丑闻的谣言时不时浮出水面。克林顿不是“特氟龙”候选人。一切都粘在他身上，但最终一切都不重要了。

His campaign adviser posted a sign over his desk that read simply: "IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID." With a charismatic smile and a gentle, sincere voice, Clinton hammered away at the recession, and promised new ideas and a break with twelve years of Republicans in the White House.

他的竞选顾问在他的办公桌上贴了一个牌子，上面简单地写着:“这是经济问题，笨蛋。”克林顿带着迷人的微笑和温柔、真诚的声音，对经济衰退进行了猛烈抨击，并承诺提出新的想法，与在白宫执政12年的共和党人决裂。

Powerful interest groups representing doctors and insurance companies opposed Clinton. +
Many in the Congress thought the program too costly. +
Conservatives compared the plan to socialized medicine. +
Despite a "friendly" Democratic Congress, the Clintons' proposal was defeated.

最终，克林顿向国会提出了一项限制成本, 并为每个美国公民提供保险的计划。代表医生和保险公司的强大利益集团反对克林顿。国会中的许多人认为该计划成本太高。保守派将该计划与"社会化医疗"进行了比较。尽管民主党国会“友好”，克林顿夫妇的提议还是被否决了。

美国医疗问题主要体现在： +

- 很多人没有医疗保险，据1991年的人口普查统计，当时约有3 700万人没有任何医疗保险，占总人口的15％.
- 医疗费用高，1992年美国医疗总费用占到GDP的14％，而且有不断增长的趋势。

1993年10月，克林顿正式向国会递交了长达1 342页的《医疗保障法案》(Health Security Act)，其内容包括：

- 扩大医保覆盖范围。强制雇主补助员工, 来购买"私营医疗保险"，保险费由雇主承担80％、员工缴纳20％。政府对小企业、失业者和穷人提供医疗补贴。
- 建立"健康同盟"。这是病人和医生间的"非盈利性中介组织"，加入"健康同盟"必须缴纳一定的保险费，**同盟则为成员提供各种医疗保险方案的信息，帮助成员选择优质、经济的保险方案，**并替他们付款。*组建"健康同盟"的目的是将以往分散的单个病人联合起来，在与保险公司、医院和医生进行价格谈判时，可以发挥团体优势，从而降低医疗费用*，提高医疗质量。

经过持续的激烈辩论，几经修订，克林顿医保方案最终也没有通过。主要原因是:

- 共和党坚决抵制，他们担心中产阶级将会对政府产生依赖.
- **医疗保险行业也反对，他们担心在新体制下, 会受到政府的严格监管，**从而丧失自主权力和盈利空间。

=== The Reagan Years 里根时代 (1980年代)

Americans were fed up.

In 1980, confidence in the American economy and government hit rock bottom. Looking for a change and the promise of a better future, voters turned to RONALD REAGAN for answers.


His message was clear. Government has become too big and needs to be trimmed down to size. Taxes are insanely high and need to be cut to stimulate growth and investment. Military spending should be increased to fix the degenerating state of the American war machine. Morality and character need to be reemphasized in American life. The United States is still the largest superpower in the world with the best system of government. It's time to feel good about being an American again.


Reagan's election brought a dramatic change to the federal government. No president, Republican or Democrat, had attempted to reduce the size of the federal government since Franklin Roosevelt initiated his New Deal. The tax cut that was handed to the American people benefited wealthy Americans most, with the hope that their increased income would trickle down to poorer Americans — the so-called trickle-down theory. The economic stagnation of the 1970s did come to an end, but at the cost of huge federal deficits and the increasing poverty rate.

The 1980s were a decade of scandals. The Iran-Contra Scandal proved that White House officials were willing to break the law to carry out their political agenda. Religious leaders like JIM BAKKER and JIMMY SWAGGERT became mired in dirty sex scandals. Moral turpitude ended the political career of Colorado Democrat GARY HART, who might well have been president one day. A SAVINGS AND LOAN SCAM fleeced American taxpayers for billions and billions of bailout dollars.

As the decade came to a close, it became clear that the malaise of the 1970s was over. The United States received a boost of confidence when the Cold War came to an end in 1991. The menace of a threatening Soviet Union now belonged to history, and the United States claimed the status of the only remaining superpower in the world.

'''

==== "Morning in America"

The long national nightmare was over.

The United States was filled with hard-working, God-fearing citizens who cared about their fellow Americans. Inflation and unemployment were problems of government, not the national character. Vietnam was over; America was the most powerful nation in the world. The Soviet Union was an evil empire. Old-fashioned initiative and ingenuity would maintain America's competitive edge in commerce.

These themes soothed a nation sick with the malaise of the 1970s. When all had seemed lost, a grandfatherly figure stepped forth and optimistically reassured Americans that the age-old beliefs they held about the grandeur of the United States were not myths.

This man, Ronald Wilson Reagan, understood the sprit of the times, and his message, personality, and politics dominated the 1980s.

Traditionally, working-class Americans, Southerners, Catholics, and urban dwellers had strong ties to the Democratic Party. The Republicans relied heavily on support from the rural Midwest, Protestant leaders, and wealthier voters. Ronald Reagan built a new coalition for the Republican Party in his quest for the Presidency in 1980.



Working Americans were shocked to see unemployment rates nearing double digits. Inflation was pushing the middle class into tax brackets previously reserved for the affluent classes. Reagan promised to reduce their level of misery with sound fiscal policy. Southerners disgruntled by affirmative action and busing found friendly ears in the Reagan campaign. The endorsement of Reagan by the Protestant establishment did not deter devout Catholics from voting Republican, since Reagan promised to oppose abortion rights and promote family values.

Crime-plagued city denizens looked to Reagan for comfort as he portrayed himself as the law and order candidate. Americans across demographic lines were warmed by his promises for a stronger America domestically and overseas. Very quickly, these "REAGAN DEMOCRATS" crumbled the old alignment. Jimmy Carter, his opponent in the 1980 election, never stood a chance.

'''

==== Reaganomics


The media called it Reaganomics.

During the campaign of 1980, Ronald Reagan announced a recipe to fix the nation's economic mess. He claimed an undue tax burden, excessive government regulation, and massive social spending programs hampered growth. Reagan proposed a phased 30% tax cut for the first three years of his Presidency. The bulk of the cut would be concentrated at the upper income levels. The economic theory behind the wisdom of such a plan was called SUPPLY-SIDE or TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS.



Tax relief for the rich would enable them to spend and invest more. This new spending would stimulate the economy and create new jobs. Reagan believed that a tax cut of this nature would ultimately generate even more revenue for the federal government. The Congress was not as sure as Reagan, but they did approve a 25% cut during Reagan's first term.

The results of this plan were mixed. Initially, the FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD believed the tax cut would re-ignite inflation and raise interest rates. This sparked a deep recession in 1981 and 1982. The high interest rates caused the value of the dollar to rise on the international exchange market, making American goods more expensive abroad. As a result, exports decreased while imports increased. Eventually, the economy stabilized in 1983, and the remaining years of Reagan's administration showed national growth.

The defense industry boomed as well. Reagan insisted that the United States was open to a "WINDOW OF VULNERABILITY" to the Soviet Union regarding nuclear defense. Massive government contracts were awarded to defense firms to upgrade the nation's military. Reagan even proposed a space-based missile defense system called the STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE. Scientists were dubious about the feasibility of a laser-guided system that could shoot down enemy missiles. Critics labeled the plan "STAR WARS."


Budget deficits

Ronald Reagan's increased spending and accompanying tax cuts resulted in dramatic budget deficits during the 1980s. A deficit occurs when spending exceeds revenues in any year.



Economists disagreed over the achievements of REAGANOMICS. Tax cuts plus increased military spending would cost the federal government trillions of dollars. Reagan advocated paying for these expenses by slashing government programs. In the end, the Congress approved his tax and defense plans, but refused to make any deep cuts to the welfare state. Even Reagan himself was squeamish about attacking popular programs like Social Security and MEDICARE, which consume the largest percentages of taxpayer dollars. The results were skyrocketing deficits.

The national debt tripled from one to three trillion dollars during the REAGAN YEARS. The President and conservatives in Congress cried for a balanced budget amendment, but neither branch had the discipline to propose or enact a balanced budget. The growth that Americans enjoyed during the 1980s came at a huge price for the generations to follow.

'''

==== Foreign and Domestic Entanglements


Ronald Reagan, Cold Warrior.


He believed the United States could ill afford to sit passively while communism expanded aggressively. He announced the REAGAN DOCTRINE, which pledged American support to "FREEDOM FIGHTERS" opposing Communism any where on the globe.

'''

==== The End of the Cold War


When Mikhail Gorbachev assumed the reins of power in the Soviet Union in 1985, no one predicted the revolution he would bring. A dedicated reformer, Gorbachev introduced the policies of glasnost and perestroika to the USSR.

The unraveling of the SOVIET BLOC began in Poland in June 1989. Despite previous Soviet military interventions in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland itself, Polish voters elected a noncommunist opposition government to their legislature. The world watched with anxious eyes, expecting Soviet tanks to roll into Poland preventing the new government from taking power.



Gorbachev, however, refused to act.

Like dominoes, Eastern European communist dictatorships fell one by one. By the fall of 1989, East and West Germans were tearing down the BERLIN WALL with pickaxes. Communist regimes were ousted in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. On Christmas Day, the brutal Romanian dictator NICOLAE CEAUSESCU and his wife were summarily executed on live television. Yugoslavia threw off the yoke of communism only to dissolve quickly into a violent civil war.

Demands for freedom soon spread to the Soviet Union. The BALTIC STATES of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania declared independence. Talks of similar sentiments were heard in UKRAINE, the CAUCASUS, and the CENTRAL ASIAN states. Here Gorbachev wished to draw the line. Self-determination for Eastern Europe was one thing, but he intended to maintain the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union. In 1991, he proposed a Union Treaty, giving greater autonomy to the Soviet republics, while keeping them under central control.


When Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power of the Soviet Union in 1985, he instituted the policies of glasnost and perestroika in hopes of sparking the sluggish economy. What resulted from this taste of freedom was the revolution that ended the Cold War.

That summer, a coup by conservative hardliners took place. Gorbachev was placed under house arrest. Meanwhile, BORIS YELTSIN, the leader of the RUSSIAN SOVIET REPUBLIC, demanded the arrest of the hardliners. The army and the public sided with Yeltsin, and the coup failed. Though Gorbachev was freed, he was left with little legitimacy.

Nationalist leaders like Yeltsin were far more popular than he could hope to become. In December 1991, Ukraine, BYELORUSSIA, and RUSSIA itself declared independence and the Soviet Union was dissolved. Gorbachev was a president without a country.

Americans were pleasantly shocked, but shocked nonetheless at the turn of events in the Soviet bloc. No serious discourse on any diplomatic levels in the USSR addressed the likelihood of a Soviet collapse. Republicans were quick to claim credit for winning the Cold War. They believed the military spending policies of the Reagan-Bush years forced the Soviets to the brink of economic collapse. Democrats argued that containment of communism was a bipartisan policy for 45 years begun by the Democrat Harry Truman.

Others pointed out that no one really won the Cold War. The United States spent trillions of dollars arming themselves for a direct confrontation with the Soviet Union that fortunately never came. Regardless, thousands of American lives were lost waging proxy wars in Korea and Vietnam.

Most Americans found it difficult to get used to the idea of no Cold War. Since 1945, Americans were born into a Cold War culture that featured McCarthyist witchhunts, backyard bomb shelters, a space race, a missile crisis, détente, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Star Wars defense proposal. Now the enemy was beaten, but the world remained unsafe. In many ways, facing one superpower was simpler than challenging dozens of rogue states and renegade groups sponsoring global terrorism.

Americans hoped against hope that the new world order of the 1990s would be marked with the security and prosperity to which they had become accustomed.


'''

=== Toward a New Millennium

The last decade of the 20th century was marked with dizzying change for the United States. With the Soviet Union out of the picture, American diplomats sought to create a "NEW WORLD ORDER" based on democracy, free-market capitalism and the Western lifestyle.

'''


==== Operation Desert Storm

The first major foreign crisis for the United States after the end of the Cold War presented itself in August 1990. Saddam Hussein, the dictator of Iraq, ordered his army across the border into tiny Kuwait. This was no ordinary act of aggression. Iraq's army was well equipped. The United States had provided massive military aid to Iraq during their eight-year war with Iran, giving them the fourth largest army in the world.

Kuwait was a major supplier of oil to the United States. The Iraqi takeover posed an immediate threat to neighboring Saudi Arabia, another major exporter of oil. If Saudi Arabia fell to Saddam, Iraq would control one-fifth of the world's oil supply. All eyes were on the White House, waiting for a response. President Bush, who succeeded President Reagan, stated simply: "This will not stand."




In the last months of 1990, the United States participated in the defense of Saudi Arabia in a deployment known as Operation Desert Shield. Over 500,000 American troops were placed in Saudi Arabia in case of an Iraqi attack on the Saudis. The U.S. further sought multilateral support in the United Nations Security Council. Traditionally, Iraq was an ally of the Soviet Union, who held a veto power over any potential UN military action. Looking westward for support for their dramatic internal changes, the USSR did not block the American plan. The UN condemned Iraq and helped form a coalition to fight Saddam militarily.

Bush, remembering the lessons of Vietnam, sought public support as well. Although there were scant opponents of the conflict, the vast majority of Americans and a narrow majority of the Congress supported the President's actions. When all the forces were in place, the United States issued an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein: leave Kuwait by January 15,1991 or face a full attack by the multinational force.


January 15 came and went with no response from the Iraqis. The next night Desert Shield became Desert Storm. Bombing sorties pummeled Iraq's military targets for the next several weeks. On many days there were over 2500 such missions. Iraq responded by launching Scud missiles at American military barracks in Saudi Arabia and Israel. Attacking Israel was a stratagem to persuade all the neighboring Arab nations to join the Iraqi cause. After intense diplomatic pressure and negotiation, the Arab nations remained in opposition to Iraq.

On February 24, the ground war began. Although the bombing lasted for weeks, American ground troops declared Kuwait liberated just 100 hours after the ground attack was initiated. American foot soldiers moved through Kuwait and entered southern Iraq. This posed a dilemma for the United States. The military objectives were complete, but Saddam, the perpetrator of the unprovoked invasion of Kuwait, was still ruling Iraq from Baghdad. President Bush feared that the allies would not support the occupation of Baghdad. Concerns were raised that if Saddam's regime were toppled, the entire nation could disintegrate into a civil war. Soon Iraq agreed to terms for a ceasefire, and the conflict subsided.



Iraq did not leave Kuwait untouched. Millions of dollars of valuables were plundered by the occupying troops. As Iraq retreated, they detonated explosives at many of Kuwait's oil wells. The disaster to the environment grew as Iraq dumped oil into the Persian Gulf. The costs were enormous, and casualty figure staggering. Although estimates range in the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths, only 148 Americans were killed in the battle. This was primarily because of the technological advances of the United States.

The United States passed its first test of the post-Cold War world. Skillful diplomacy proved that the United Nations could be used as an instrument of force when necessary. Although Moscow did not contribute troops to the operation, they gave tacit approval for the attack. The potential for multinational cooperation was demonstrated. The largest American military operation since Vietnam was completed with smashing success. Most Americans felt confident in their military and technological edge once more. President Bush promptly declared that the "new world order had begun."


'''

====  A Baby Boomer in the White House


President Bush enjoyed an approval rating in March 1991 of 91 percent for his handling of Operation Desert Storm. As the Presidential race for 1992 began to unfold, many potential candidates were scared to challenge him and look to 1996 as a better opportunity. But the recession that battered the American economy would not go away. As growth remained low and unemployment persisted, some of the shine began to wear off the President. Not since JAMES MONROE'S second term in 1820 had a sitting President been re-elected during an economic slump.



Enter Bill Clinton.

The two candidates could hardly have been more different. Bush was a hero of World War II and had extensive Washington experience, including heading the CIA, Ambassador to the United Nations, and eight years as Vice-President.

Clinton was born after World War II and did not fight in Vietnam, so he faced constant charges of dodging the draft. He had no experience on the federal level of government; he simply was the popular governor of Arkansas. Throughout the campaign, scandal after scandal hit Clinton. Charges of adultery were addressed on television. When accused of smoking marijuana in the 1960s, Clinton confessed — but added that he did not inhale. Rumors of a real estate scandal called WHITEWATER surfaced from time to time. Clinton was no "Teflon" candidate. Everything stuck to him, but none of it mattered in the end.

His campaign adviser posted a sign over his desk that read simply: "IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID." With a charismatic smile and a gentle, sincere voice, Clinton hammered away at the recession, and promised new ideas and a break with twelve years of Republicans in the White House.


Election Day belonged to Bill Clinton. Although he garnered only 43% of the popular vote, he beat President Bush handily in the electoral tally. Bush earned 38% of the vote, and Perot reached an impressive 19% of American voters. Much of Clinton's support came from baby boomers. Clinton's victory marked an end to the domination of politics by the World War II generation. Americans who had come of age during the turbulent sixties and seventies now had a representative in the White House.

'''

==== 克林顿医改 (失败)

It seemed like Bill Clinton had everything going for him. He defeated an incumbent President and became the first Democrat to win the White House since Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford. He had a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate to work with him.

One of the first major initiatives he began was health care reform. Many Americans were concerned about spiraling medical costs. Medicare did not cover prescription drugs and only paid a portion of health care costs. Over 20 million Americans had no HEALTH INSURANCE whatsoever. Clinton assembled a task force to study the problem and assigned his wife HILLARY to head the committee. She became the most politically active first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt.

Eventually Clinton presented a plan to limit costs and insure each American citizen to the Congress. Powerful interest groups representing doctors and insurance companies opposed Clinton. Many in the Congress thought the program too costly. Conservatives compared the plan to socialized medicine. Despite a "friendly" Democratic Congress, the Clintons' proposal was defeated.


As the year 2000 approached, partisan politics were as toxic as ever. Republicans claimed that they fixed the economy and Clinton got the credit. Regardless of who gets the credit or blame, the 1990s were a decade of very steady economic growth. The crippling budget deficits of the 1980s were finally brought under control, and Americans enjoyed low inflation, low unemployment, low interest rates and a booming stock market. Even the bad blood between the two parties could not change that.

==== The End of the American Century


The NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (NAFTA) ended economic barriers with Canada and Mexico and promised even more prosperity.


Why then did so many Americans feel uneasiness and uncertainty as the 21st century approached? Economic challenges were created by the prosperous Pacific Rim and a stronger European Union. Despite prosperity, real incomes stagnated for the bottom half of American wage earners. Although legal barriers to equality were largely eliminated for American minority groups, economic equality was but a dream. Women made advances toward equity, but still earned less than 75 cents for every dollar earned by American males. Many Americans felt they were working longer hours for less.


Pessimists depicted America as a civilization in decline. The rise of the divorce rate led to many children being raised in broken homes. Gun violence was a major problem. SCHOOL SHOOTINGS became commonplace.

Will the 21st century also be an American century? Or will the United States be eclipsed by new superpowers like China or the EUROPEAN UNION? Only time will reveal the answers.

In the meanwhile, the United States will rely on its history of increasing democracy and respect for human rights, its dynamic diversity, and the innovative character of its people to seek new solutions to whatever problems may arise.
