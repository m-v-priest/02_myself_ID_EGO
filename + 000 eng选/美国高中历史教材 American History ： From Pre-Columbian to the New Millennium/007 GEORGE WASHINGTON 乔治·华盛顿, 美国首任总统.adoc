== (解说) GEORGE WASHINGTON 乔治·华盛顿, 美国首任总统

A brilliant group of political leaders emerged during the Revolutionary Era and the early years of the new nation. Collectively, they are called the FOUNDING FATHERS and their names are familiar — Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison.
革命时期, 和新国家成立初期, 涌现出一批杰出的政治领导人。他们被统称为"国父"，他们的名字也很熟悉——托马斯·杰斐逊、约翰·亚当斯、本杰明·富兰克林、亚历山大·汉密尔顿, 和詹姆斯·麦迪逊。

Late 18th-century America still had a relatively small population, yet this group of major figures looms larger and appears more talented than any similar group at any other time in the country's history. It seems clear that the momentous events of the period and their obvious significance, encouraged many, perhaps most, of these individuals to step beyond the bounds of ordinary life to achieve greatness.
18世纪末的美国人口, 仍然相对较少，但这群重要人物, 却比该国历史上任何其他时期的任何类似群体, 显得更重大、更有才华。很明显，这一时期的重大事件, 及其明显的重要意义, 鼓励了许多人，也许是大多数人，超越他们原本平凡生活的界限，而实现伟大。


Perhaps the most eminent of this group, and almost certainly the single most important for the success of the Revolution and the stability of the new nation, was GEORGE WASHINGTON. As an able delegate from Virginia, he participated in the First and Second Continental Congresses.
也许这个群体中, 最杰出的人物，而且几乎肯定是对革命的成功, 和新国家的稳定最重要的人物，就是乔治·华盛顿。作为来自"弗吉尼亚州"的一位能干的代表，他参加了第一届, 和第二届大陆会议。

However, his role in the fight toward independence became crucial during the war itself when he served for its duration as the commander of the Continental Army. After a brief retirement from public service, he once again became a political leader at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, where he was elected the presiding officer. Once Washington somewhat reluctantly agreed to be a presidential candidate, his election in 1789 received almost universal support. Everyone knew that he was the obvious choice to be the first president of the United States.
然而，当他在战争期间担任"大陆军司令"时，他在争取独立的斗争中所扮演的角色, 变得至关重要。从公共服务部门短暂退休后，他在 1787 年"制宪会议"上, 再次成为政治领袖，并当选为"会议主席"。华盛顿虽然有些不情愿地同意成为"总统候选人"，但他在 1789 年的当选, 几乎得到了普遍的支持。每个人都知道, 他是美国第一任总统的不二人选。


George Washington was a serious man.
乔治华盛顿, 是一个严肃的人。

He carried himself with a grave dignity often described as aloofness. Quite the opposite of being an informal joker, Washington held people at a distance. A central part of his personality included strong self-control that avoided excessive camaraderie. Surely, his long military service played a significant role molding this character. First as a militia officer on the Virginia frontier preceding and during the French and Indian War (1754-58) and then again as the commander of the Continental Army (1775-83), Washington believed that familiarity could weaken the respect an officer needed for effective command.
他举止庄严，常被形容为冷漠。华盛顿与一个不拘礼节的开玩笑者恰恰相反，他与人们保持着一定的距离。他性格的核心部分, 包括强烈的自我控制力，避免过度的友情。当然，他长期的军旅生涯, 对塑造这个性格起到了重要作用。华盛顿先是在法印战争（1754-58 年）之前和期间, 担任弗吉尼亚边境的民兵军官，然后又担任大陆军司令（1775-83 年），他认为, 熟悉可能会削弱军官所需要的尊重, 及有效的指挥。

Washington's greatest contribution to the Revolutionary War, however, was his consistent acknowledgment of the preeminence of civilian leadership. When other military leaders might have been tempted to seize political power and rule as a more efficient strong man, Washington's respect for the preeminence of CIVIL AUTHORITY over MARTIAL AUTHORITY kept the republican experiment alive.
然而，华盛顿对独立战争的最大贡献是, 他一贯承认"文职领导"的卓越地位(即文官政治)。当其他军事领导人可能试图夺取政治权力, 并以更有效率的"强人"的身份进行统治时，华盛顿对"文职权力高于军事权力"的尊重, 使共和实验得以继续进行。


Washington happily resigned his military command at the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783. He saw himself living out his days as a farmer at Mt. Vernon. But he would be called on to lead the country again — this time not in war, but peace.
1783 年独立战争结束时，华盛顿愉快地辞去了军事指挥权。他在弗农山度过了农民的日子。但他将再次被要求领导这个国家——这次不是在战争中，而是在和平时期。

During the critical period of the 1780s Washington privately feared that the weak central government dictated by the Articles of Confederation threatened the long-term health of the nation. He supported the call for a Constitutional Convention and after some hesitation attended as a delegate where he was elected the presiding officer.
在 1780 年代的关键时期，华盛顿私下担心《邦联条例》规定的软弱的中央政府, 会威胁到国家的长期健康。他支持召开"制宪会议"的呼吁，并在犹豫一番后作为代表出席，并当选为会"议主席"。

He took a relatively limited role, however, in the debate that created the proposed Constitution. Nor did he publicly favor ratification. It seems that his sense of personal reserve prevented him from actively campaigning. As he was likely to become the first president, he avoided the appearance of self-serving motivation by not aggressively supporting the Constitution in public.
然而，他在制定宪法提案的辩论中, 发挥的作用相对有限。他也没有公开支持批准。看来他个人的矜持意识, 阻碍了他积极竞选。由于他很可能成为第一任总统，因此他没有在公开场合积极支持宪法，以避免出现自私动机。

The significance of the FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION under the Constitution is hard to overstate. The Constitution provided a bare structural outline for the federal government, but how it would actually come together was unclear. The precedent established by the first president would be enormous. Washington generally proceeded with great caution. For the most part he continued precedents that had been established under the Articles of Confederation. For instance, he carried over the three departments of the government that had existed before the Constitution.
宪法规定的第一任总统政府的重要性, 怎么强调都不为过。**宪法为联邦政府提供了一个简单的结构纲要，但它实际上该如何运作整合, 还尚不清楚。那么由第一任总统开创的先例, 就将是影响巨大的。** 华盛顿总体上非常谨慎地行事。在很大程度上，他延续了根据《邦联条例》确立的先例。例如，他继承了宪法之前存在的三个政府部门。

But the nationalist Washington favored a stronger central government and made sure that executive authority was independent from total legislative control. For instance, Washington appointed his own head to each department of government whom the legislature could only accept or reject. Furthermore, Washington identified the three leaders (Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state, Alexander Hamilton of the treasury, and Henry Knox of war) as his personal "cabinet" of advisers, thus underscoring the executive's domain. Particularly in his first term as president from 1789-1792, Washington's enormous personal popularity and stature enhanced the legitimacy of the modest new national government.
但民族主义的华盛顿, 主张建立更强大的中央政府，并确保"行政权力"独立于完全的"立法"控制。例如，华盛顿任命了自己的政府各部门负责人，"立法机关"只能接受或拒绝。此外，华盛顿还指定三位领导人（托马斯·杰斐逊担任"国务卿"、亚历山大·汉密尔顿担任"财政部长", 亨利·诺克斯担任"战争顾问"）作为他的个人顾问“内阁”，从而强调了行政部门的职权范围。特别是在 1789 年至 1792 年的第一个总统任期内，华盛顿巨大的个人声望和地位, 增强了温和的新国家政府的合法性。

Unfortunately for Washington, events in his second term somewhat clouded his extraordinary success. For one, his own cabinet split apart as Thomas Jefferson increasingly dissented from the economic policies proposed by Alexander Hamilton, most of which Washington supported.
对于华盛顿来说, 不幸的是，他第二个任期内发生的事件, 在一定程度上给他非凡的成功蒙上了阴影。其一，由于托马斯·杰斐逊越来越反对亚历山大·汉密尔顿提出的经济政策，而华盛顿支持其中大部分政策，他自己的内阁分裂了。

Even more disturbing to Washington was the emergence of a new form of political activity where the public divided into opposing parties. Although now a fundamental feature of modern democracy, Washington and many others perceived organized opposition to the government as treasonous!
更令华盛顿不安的是, 一种新形式的政治活动的出现，公众分裂成对立的政党。虽然现在是现代民主的基本特征，但当时华盛顿和许多其他人却认为, 有组织地反对政府, 是叛国行为！

These clouds at the end of Washington's public career, like the difficulties of his first military command in the 1750s, remind us that even this most stellar of the Founding Fathers hardly glided through public life without controversy. As impressive and even as indispensable as Washington had been to the creation of the new nation, he remained a leader with qualities that could not appeal to all of the people all of the time. Most interestingly perhaps, is that some of the personal qualities that made him extraordinarily effective are also ones that might make him extremely unpopular today.
华盛顿公共生涯末期的这些乌云，就像他在 1750 年代首次担任军事指挥时遇到的困难一样，提醒我们，**即使是这位最杰出的开国元勋，在公共生活中, 也很难没有争议。**尽管华盛顿对这个新国家的创建, 起到了令人印象深刻, 甚至不可或缺的作用，但**他仍然是一位领导人，其品质无法始终吸引所有人。**也许最有趣的是，*一些使他异常高效的个人品质, 也可能使他在今天极不受欢迎。*

Washington consciously cultivated a distance from the public and a personal reserve that made him aloof. He was a curious combination of late-18th century qualities — a regal republican whose disdain for democratic excess helped give life, power, and respectability to what would soon become the world's first modern democracy.
**华盛顿有意识地与公众保持距离，并保持个人的矜持，这使他显得冷漠。**他是 18 世纪晚期品质的奇妙结合体——一位富丽堂皇的共和主义者，他对"过度民主"的蔑视, 为很快成为世界上第一个现代民主国家的国家, 赋予了生命、权力和尊重。


Washington departed the presidency and the nation's then capital city of Philadelphia in September 1796 with a characteristic sense of how to take dramatic advantage of the moment.
1796年9月，华盛顿离开总统职位，离开当时的美国首都费城，他对如何利用这一时刻有着独特的认识。

WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS has long been recognized as a towering statement of American political purpose and has been read annually in the U.S. Congress as part of the national recognition of the first President's birthday for over 100 years. Although the celebration of that day and the Farewell Address no longer receives such strenuous attention, Washington's final public performance still deserves close attention.
华盛顿的告别演说长期以来一直被认为是美国政治目的的崇高宣言，一百多年来，美国国会每年都会宣读《华盛顿告别演说》，作为全国庆祝首任总统生日的一部分。尽管这一天的庆祝活动和告别演说不再受到如此强烈的关注，但华盛顿最后的公开表现仍然值得密切关注。

Washington feared that local factors might be the source of petty differences that would destroy the nation. His defense of national unity lay not just in abstract ideals, but also in the pragmatic reality that union brought clear advantages to every region. Union promised "greater strength, greater resource, [and] proportionately greater security from danger" than any state or region could enjoy alone. He emphasized, "your UNION ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty."
华盛顿担心, "地方因素"可能会成为"导致国家毁灭"的微小分歧的根源。他对"民族团结"的捍卫, 不仅存在于抽象的理想中，而且还存在于务实的现实中，即联盟给每个地区带来了明显的优势。联盟承诺比任何州或地区的各自为政, 能享有“更强大的力量、更多的资源, 以及相应的更大的"免受危险"的安全作用”。他强调，“你们的联合, 应该被视为你们能获得'自由保障'的主要支柱。”

The remainder of the Address, delivered at CONGRESS HALL in Philadelphia, examined what Washington saw as the two major threats to the nation, one domestic and the other foreign, which in the mid-1790s increasingly seemed likely to combine. First, Washington warned of "the baneful effects of the SPIRIT OF PARTY." To Washington POLITICAL PARTIES were a deep threat to the health of the nation for they allowed "a small but artful and enterprising minority" to "put in the place of the delegated will of the Nation, the will of a party."
演讲的其余部分, 在费城国会大厅发表，探讨了华盛顿所认为的, 国家面临的两大威胁，一个是国内威胁，另一个是外国威胁. 在 1790 年代中期，这两个威胁似乎越来越有可能结合在一起。首先，华盛顿警告“政党精神的有害影响”。对华盛顿来说，政党对国家的健康, 构成了严重威胁，因为他们允许“一小部分但狡猾且有进取心的少数派”, “用政党的意志, 代替国家的委托意志”。

Yet, it was the dangerous influence of foreign powers, judging from the amount of the Address that Washington devoted to it, where he predicted the greatest threat to the young United States. As European powers embarked on a long war, each hoping to draw the U.S. to its side, Washington admonished the country "to steer clear of permanent Alliances." Foreign nations, he explained, could not be trusted to do anything more than pursue their own interests when entering international treaties. Rather than expect "real favors from Nation to Nation," Washington called for extending foreign "commercial relations" that could be mutually beneficial, while maintaining "as little political connection as possible." Washington's commitment to NEUTRALITY was, in effect, an anti-French position since it overrode a 1778 treaty promising mutual support between France and the United States.
然而，从华盛顿发表的演说中, 所涉及的内容来看，他认为外国势力的危险影响, 才是对年轻的美国最大的威胁。当欧洲列强开始了一场长期战争，每个国家都希望把美国拉到自己一边时，华盛顿告诫美国“避开永久联盟”。他解释说，不要相信外国在加入国际条约时, 除了追求自己的利益之外还会做任何事情。华盛顿呼吁, 在保持“尽可能少的政治联系”的同时，要扩大可能互惠互利的对外“商业关系”，而不是期待“国与国之间的真正恩惠”。华盛顿对中立的承诺, 实际上是一种反法立场，因为它推翻了1778年法国和美国之间承诺会相互支持的条约。

George Washington, like most powerful Virginians of the 18th century, derived most of his wealth and status from the labor of African and African American slaves.
乔治·华盛顿和 18 世纪最有权势的弗吉尼亚人一样，他的大部分财富和地位, 都来自非洲和非裔美国奴隶的劳动。


When Washington arrived in Massachusetts in 1775 to take command of the patriot militia that was surrounding the British in Boston, he was surprised to discover that New Englanders had begun to allow free African Americans as well as slaves to join their ranks as soldiers.
1775 年，当华盛顿抵达马萨诸塞州，指挥爱国民兵来包围波士顿英国人时，他惊讶地发现, 新英格兰人已经开始允许自由的非裔美国人和奴隶, 加入他们的军队。


the British Army in Virginia declared that any slave of a patriot master who fled to fight the patriots would gain his freedom.
弗吉尼亚州的英国军队宣布，任何一个爱国者(即美国人)主人的奴隶，如果逃跑, 并转而去与爱国者作战，都将获得自由。

Washington immediately grasped the strategic crisis posed by this British promise of freedom in a country where one in every five people was black. Pragmatic concerns quickly led Washington to reverse his policy and by December 1775 the Continental Army, in the North at least, included black soldiers.
华盛顿立即意识到, 英国对黑人的自由承诺, 给这个五分之一人口都是黑人的国家(即美国大地), 带来了战略危机。出于务实的考虑，华盛顿很快改变了他的政策，到 1775 年 12 月，大陆军（至少在北方）包括了黑人士兵。


Washington hoped to act as a humane master by keeping slave families together. However, he soon discovered that slavery was only profitable when operated in a brutal fashion. Mt. Vernon became increasingly inefficient in Washington's final two decades.
华盛顿希望通过让奴隶家庭团结在一起来充当人道的主人。然而，他很快发现奴隶制只有在残酷的情况下才能有利可图。在华盛顿的最后二十年里，他的弗农山变得越来越低效。
