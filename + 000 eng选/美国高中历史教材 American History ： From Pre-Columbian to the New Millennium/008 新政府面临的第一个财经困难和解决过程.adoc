== (解说) 新政府面临的困难和解决过程

Washington's _towering 高大的；高耸的；屹立的 stature and legacy_ 遗产 /`谓` *might misleadingly 误导地 suggest that* /`主` the early years of the new nation *were* times of great confidence and self-congratulation 沾沾自喜；自得. +
In fact, *just the opposite was nearly the case*. +
Americans *knew that* /`主` the historical record of the long-term success of republican governments `系` was exceedingly 非常，极其 poor 可怜的；不幸的；令人同情的;缺乏；贫乏；缺少. +
Previous examples and classical political theory *suggested that* / `主` republics  `谓`  *almost all suffered* (v.) the fate of _collapsing into anarchy_ 无政府状态；混乱，无秩序 /and then *being taken over* 接替；接任；接管；接手 by _a power-seizing tyrant_.

[.my2]
华盛顿崇高的地位和遗产, 可能会误导人，让人以为这个新国家的早年, 是充满自信和沾沾自喜的时期。事实上，情况几乎恰恰相反。美国人知道，共和政府长期成功的历史记录, 极其糟糕。之前的例子, 和古典政治理论表明，共和国几乎都遭遇了陷入无政府状态，然后被夺权暴君接管的命运。

_The Philadelphia 费城 patriot_ BENJAMIN RUSH *keenly 敏锐地；强烈地；锐利地 understood* the risks 后定 *facing* the new nation. +
As a result /he sharply rejected the idea /that `主` _the military defeat_ of the British /`谓` meant the end of the American Revolution. +
"On the contrary," he wrote in 1787," nothing but 只不过;只是 _the first act_ of _the great drama_ 戏；剧 is closed. +
It remains yet /to establish and perfect (v.) our new forms of government."

[.my2]
费城爱国者本杰明·拉什, 敏锐地了解这个新国家面临的风险。结果，他尖锐地拒绝了"英国的军事失败, 就意味着美国革命结束"的观点。 “恰恰相反，”他在 1787 年写道，“这出伟大戏剧的第一幕, 已经结束。但我们新的政府形式, 还有待建立和完善。”


`主` The unsettled _domestic issues_ (n.) /后定 that threatened /to overturn (v.) the new republic /`系`  were varied and complex. +
Any one of _the major crisis points_ of the early 1790s /`谓` might overturn (v.)  the fragile new government. +
Where was the greatest threat: the challenging (a.) _legal 与法律有关的；法律的 and political issues_ /后定 raised during the ratification of the Constitution, _the disastrous (a.)极糟糕的；灾难性的；完全失败的 economy_ of the 1780s, _popular 民众的；百姓的 protests_ (n.) against _federal policies_ in the west, or _the varied military threats_ from Native Americans, the British in Canada, and war in Europe?  +
If any one of them *could have toppled* (v.)（使）失去平衡而坠落，倒塌，倒下;打倒；推翻；颠覆 the government, *imagine* (v.) how their combination /*must have made* Americans *fear (v.) for* the future of the country.

[.my2]
威胁"推翻新共和国"的未决的国内问题, 多种多样, 且复杂。 1790 年代初期的任何一个重大危机点, 都可能推翻脆弱的新政府。最大的威胁在哪里：宪法批准过程中提出的具有挑战性的法律和政治问题、1780年代灾难性的经济、西方针对联邦政策的民众抗议，或者来自美洲原住民、加拿大英国人的各种军事威胁，以及欧洲的战争？如果他们中的任何一个, 都能推翻政府的话，想象一下, 它们的结合,一定会让美国人对国家的未来感到忧虑。

`主` Most of these _deeply unsettling (a.)令人不安（或紧张、担忧）的 threats_ (n.) /`谓` would *be addressed* (v.)设法解决；处理；对付 by the first federal government /and usually *in an aggressive manner* /that *scored (v.)得分;获得胜利；取得优势 decisive 决定性的；关键的 victory*. +
Interestingly, however, `主` the solutions /*achieved by* the first wielders 行使者；地下党 of federal power /`谓` also helped /to create the conditions 后定 that would *force (v.) them from office* 迫使他们下台 /and *lead to* a dramatic change in American politics by 1800. +
To understand how much changed /*between* _the presidential elections_ of George Washington (1789) *and* Thomas Jefferson (1800), `主` the kinds of #challenges# 后定 that *had to be faced* in the first decade of government under the new federal Constitution /`谓` #must# *be examined*.

[.my2]
这些令人深感不安的威胁, 大多会由第一届联邦政府来解决，而且通常会以一种咄咄逼人的方式, 取得决定性的胜利。然而，有趣的是，联邦权力的第一批掌权者所取得的解决方案, 也帮助创造了迫使他们下台的条件，并导致了1800年美国政治的巨大变化。要了解乔治·华盛顿(1789年)和托马斯·杰斐逊(1800年)的总统选举之间, 发生了多大的变化，就必须研究联邦"新宪法"下, 政府头十年必须面对的各种挑战。


=== The Bill of Rights 权利法案

The first national election *occurred* in 1789. +
*Along with* 同…一道,伴随 President Washington, voters *elected* _a large number of supporters_ of the Constitution. +
In fact, almost half of the ninety-one members of the first Congress *had helped /to write or ratify* (v.) the Constitution.

[.my2]
1789年举行第一次全国选举。选民与华盛顿总统一起, 选出了大量宪法支持者。事实上，第一届国会的九十一位议员中, 几乎有一半曾经帮助起草或批准过宪法。

Not surprisingly, given 考虑到 Anti-Federalists' opposition (n.) to the strong new central government, only eight opponents of the Constitution *were sent to* the House of Representatives. +
Most Anti-Federalists /`谓` *concentrated* their efforts *in* state politics.

[.my2]
毫不奇怪，鉴于"反联邦党人"反对强大的新中央政府，宪法的反对者中, 只有八名被派往"众议院"。大多数的"反联邦主义者", 将他们的努力集中在州政治上。


`主` #An immediate 当前的；迫切的 issue# /后定 that the new Congress *took up* 继续；接下去;继续（他人未完成的事）；接着讲（以前提过的事） /`系` #was# how to modify (v.) the Constitution. +
Representatives *were responding (v.)（口头或书面）回答，回应 to* calls (n.) /for amendments /后定 that *had emerged* /as a chief issue /during the ratification process. +
_Crucial states_ of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New York (among others) *had all ultimately 最终；最后；终归 supported* the Constitution — but *only with the expectation 预料；预期；期待 /that* `主` _explicit （说话）清晰的，明确的；直言的；坦率的 protections_ for _individual rights_ `谓` *would be added to* _the highest law_ of the land. +
*Now that* supporters of the Constitution *controlled* the federal government, what would they do ?

[.my2]
新国会立即讨论的一个问题, 是如何修改宪法。代表们正在回应 在之前批准宪法过程中, 作为主要问题提出的"修正案"呼吁。马萨诸塞州、弗吉尼亚州, 和纽约州（以及其他州）等重要州, 最终都支持了宪法，但条件是, 期望在该国的最高法律(即宪法)中, 加入对"个人权利"的明确保护。现在, 宪法的支持者已经控制了联邦政府，那么他们会做什么？

`主` The legal tradition 法律传统 of *having a precise statement of* individual rights /`谓` *had deep roots in* Anglo-American custom. +
So *it's not surprising that* /`主` the first Congress `谓` *amended* the Constitution /by adding what became known as the Bill of Rights.

[.my2]
对"个人权利"进行精确陈述的法律传统, 深深植根于英美习俗中。因此，第一届国会通过添加所谓的《权利法案》来修改宪法, 也就不足为奇了。

James Madison, now _a member of Congress_ from Virginia, once again *took the leading role* /crafting (v.) _proposed amendments_ /that would *be sent to* the states /for approval. +
Madison skillfully *reviewed* numerous proposals and examples 列证;模范
 /*from* state constitutions /and ultimately selected nineteen potential _amendments to the Constitution_ 宪法.

[.my2]
来自弗吉尼亚州的现任国会议员, 詹姆斯·麦迪逊, 再次发挥主导作用，他起草拟议的修正案，并将其送交各州批准。麦迪逊巧妙地审查了州宪法中的众多提案和例子，最终选出了十九项可能的宪法修正案。

As one *might expect*, the nationalist Madison *took care* /to make sure that /`主` none of _the proposed amendments_ `谓` would *fundamentally 根本上；完全地 weaken* (v.) the new central government. +
In the end, ten amendments were ratified /in 1791.

[.my2]
正如人们所预料的那样，民族主义者麦迪逊小心翼翼地确保拟议的修正案, 不会从根本上削弱新中央政府。最终，1791年批准了十项修正案。


These first _ten amendments to the Constitution_ /*became known as* _the Bill of Rights_ /and still *stand as* #both# the symbol 象征 #and# foundation 地基；房基；基础 of _American ideals_ of _individual liberty_, LIMITED GOVERNMENT, and _the rule of law_. +
`主` Most of _the Bill of Rights_ /`谓` concerns (v.)涉及，与……相关 _legal protections_ /*for* those 后定 accused of crimes.

[.my2]
宪法的前十项修正案, 被称为《权利法案》，至今仍然是美国"个人自由"、"有限政府", 和"法治理想"的象征和基础。 《权利法案》的大部分内容, 涉及对被指控犯罪者的法律保护。

`主` #A major problem# /facing the first federal government /`系` #was# *how to deal with* the financial chaos /created by the American Revolution. +

There was _runaway 失控的 inflation_. +
Almost all areas of the economy /`谓` looked dismal 忧郁的；凄凉的；惨淡的；阴沉的 /throughout 自始至终；贯穿整个时期;各处；遍及 the 1780s. +
Economic _hard times_ `系` were a major factor /creating _the sense of crisis_ 危机感 /that produced the stronger central government under the new Constitution.

[.my2]
第一届联邦政府面临的一个主要问题, 是如何应对美国革命造成的财政混乱。各国背负着巨额战争债务。通货膨胀失控。整个 1780 年代，几乎所有经济领域都显得黯淡无光。经济困难时期, 是产生危机感的一个主要因素，从而在新宪法下产生了更强大的中央政府。

`主` #The first issue# /that Hamilton tackled 解决，处理，对付 as Washington's SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY 财政部长 /`谓` #concerned# 影响，涉及，牵涉（某人） the problem of PUBLIC CREDIT. +
Governments 后定 at all levels `谓` *had taken on* so much debt /during the Revolution. +
The commitment *to pay them back* /`谓` was not taken very seriously. +
By the late 1780s, the value of such _public securities_ 有价证券；担保；抵押物 *had plunged to* a small fraction 小部分；少量；一点儿 of their face value. +
In other words, state IOU's 借据，欠条（表示 I owe you） — the money 后定 borrowed to finance (v.)提供资金 the Revolution — were viewed as nearly worthless.

[.my2]
汉密尔顿作为华盛顿财政部长, 解决的第一个问题, 涉及"公共信用"问题。革命期间，各级政府承担了大量债务。偿还它们的承诺, 并没有得到认真对待。到 1780 年代末，此类公共证券的价值, 已跌至其面值的一小部分。换句话说，国家欠条——为革命提供资金而借来的钱——被认为几乎一文不值。


Hamilton *issued (v.) a bold proposal*. +
The federal government should *pay off* 偿还债务；清偿欠款 all _CONFEDERATION (state) debts_ at full value. +
Such action `谓` would dramatically enhance (v.) the legitimacy 合法性，合理性 of the new central government. +
To raise money /to pay off the debts, Hamilton would issue (v.) new _SECURITIES 有价证券 bonds_ 债券；公债. +
Investors who had purchased these public securities 公共证券 /`谓` could make enormous profits /when the time came /for the United States *to pay off* these new debts.

[.my2]
汉密尔顿提出了一个大胆的建议。联邦政府应全额偿还所有联邦（州）债务。此类行动, 将极大地增强新中央政府的合法性。为了筹集资金偿还债务，汉密尔顿将发行新的证券债券(即借新还旧)。当美国偿还这些新债务时，购买这些公共证券的投资者, 可以赚取巨额利润。

Hamilton's vision /for reshaping the American economy /`谓` included a _federal charter_ 特许状，许可证，凭照 /for a national financial institution 金融机构. +
He proposed a BANK OF THE UNITED STATES. +
Modeled (v.)模仿；仿照 along *the lines 方法；方式 of* the Bank of England, a _central bank_ would help *make* the new nation's _economy dynamic_ (n.)（人或事物）相互作用的方式，动态;力学；动力学 /*through* a more stable _paper CURRENCY_ 纸币.

[.my2]
汉密尔顿重塑美国经济的愿景包括: 为国家金融机构制定联邦宪章。他提议成立美国银行。按照英格兰银行的模式，中央银行将通过更稳定的纸币, 帮助新国家的经济充满活力。

[.my2]
汉密尔顿拥有非常敏锐的经济眼光。他对制造业、银行和强大公共信用的积极支持，都成为他死后一个世纪里美国发展的现代资本主义经济的核心方面。*然而，他的政策在当时, 引起了很大争议。*

Many Americans #neither# like Hamilton's _elitist 精英主义的，精英统治的；有优越感的 attitude_ /#nor# his commitment /to a British model of economic development. +
His pro-British foreign policy /was potentially explosive (a.)易爆发的；可能引起冲动的；爆炸性的 in the wake of the Revolution. +
`主` Hamilton favored an even stronger central government /than the Constitution /`谓` had created and often *linked* (v.) _democratic impulses_ 民主冲动 *with* potential anarchy 无政府状态；混乱，无秩序. +
Finally, because the beneficiaries of his _innovative economic policies_ /*were concentrated in* the northeast, they threatened to stimulate _divisive 造成不和的；引起分歧的；制造分裂的 geographic differences_ in the new nation.

[.my2]
许多美国人既不喜欢汉密尔顿的精英主义态度，也不喜欢他对英国经济发展模式的承诺。革命后，他的亲英外交政策, 可能具有爆炸性。汉密尔顿赞成建立比宪法所规定的更强大的中央政府，并经常将"民主冲动", 与"潜在的无政府状态"联系起来。最后，*由于他的创新经济政策的受益者, 集中在东北部，这些政策可能会刺激新国家产生地理差异。*

Regardless, Hamilton's _economic philosophies_ 哲学；哲学体系，思想体系 /became touchstones 试金石；检验标准 of the modern American capitalist economy.

[.my2]
不管怎样，汉密尔顿的经济哲学, 成为现代美国资本主义经济的试金石。

[.my2]
1790 年代，美国生活和政治的最前沿, 出现了巨大的分歧。关于"如何最好地维持革命利益"的强烈分歧, 是这些冲突的核心。汉密尔顿的经济政策, 是紧张局势最早的根源之一。它们不仅引起民选官员和普通农民的强烈反应，甚至导致华盛顿内阁的分裂。

Nowhere *did* the Constitution *allow* /for the federal government /*to create* a bank.

[.my2]
汉密尔顿成功申请成立美国国家银行, 也遭到了杰斐逊的强烈反对。他们对银行的分歧, 源于对宪法的尖锐对立的解释。对于杰斐逊来说，这种行动, 显然超出了联邦政府的权力范围。杰斐逊在他对宪法的“严格解释”中指出，*第十修正案要求所有联邦权力, 都在法律中明确规定。宪法中没有任何地方, 允许了联邦政府设立银行。*

Hamilton *responded with* a "LOOSE INTERPRETATION" /that #allowed# such federal action /状 #under a clause# /后定 *permitting* Congress *to make* "all Laws /which *shall be* NECESSARY AND PROPER."

[.my2]
*汉密尔顿以“宽松的解释”回应，允许这样的联邦行动，根据一项条款，允许国会制定“一切必要和适当的法律”。*

Neither side /was absolutely right. +
The Constitution needed INTERPRETATION. +
In this difference, however, we can see sharply _contrasting (a.)（在式样、颜色或态度上）极不相同的，迥异的 visions_ /for the future of the republic.

This split (n.)分歧；分裂；分离 in Congress /`谓` loomed (v.) as a potential threat to the union /because northern representatives (n.)代表 overwhelmingly voted (v.) favorably, while southerners were strongly opposed (a.v.). +
The difference *stemmed from* significant economic differences between the sections 区；地区；地段. +
Large cities, merchants, and leading financiers /were much more numerous /in the north /and stood (v.)站立,位于（某处） to benefit (v.)得益于；得利于 from Hamilton's plans.

[.my2]
对汉密尔顿金融政策的反对, 蔓延到内阁之外。立法机关对于是否支持"美国银行", 存在分歧。国会的这种分裂, 对联邦构成了潜在威胁，因为北方代表, 以压倒性的票数, 投了赞成票，而南方人则强烈反对。这种差异, 源于各地域之间显着的经济差异。北方的大城市、商人和主要金融家的数量, 要多得多，并且将从汉密尔顿的计划中受益。


Keen observers /began to fear that /`主` sharp sectional differences /`谓` might soon threaten (v.) the union. +
Indeed, the Bank ultimately 最终；最后；终归 found (v.) support in Congress /through a compromise 折中，妥协；妥协方案 /that included a commitment /to build the new FEDERAL CAPITAL 联邦首都 /on the banks 岸 of the Potomac River. +
In part /this *stemmed from* the fact that /southern states *such as* Virginia /had already *paid off* 付清；偿清 their war debt /and *stood* to gain nothing from a central bank. +

By dividing the centers of economic and political power /`主` many `谓` *hoped* /to avoid a dangerous concentration of power /in _any one place_ or region.

[.my2]
敏锐的观察家开始担心，尖锐的双方分歧, 可能很快就会威胁到联邦。事实上，该银行最终通过一项妥协, 获得了国会的支持，其中包括承诺在波托马克河畔建设新的联邦首都。这在一定程度上源于这样一个事实：弗吉尼亚等南方各州, 已经偿还了战争债务，并且不会从中央银行获得任何好处。*虽然汉密尔顿政策的大部分商业受益者, 都集中在东北部城市，但华盛顿特区的政治首都, 将位于农业更为发达的南部。通过划分经济和政治权力中心，许多人希望避免危险的权力集中在任何一个地方或地区。*

Washington's towering stature and legacy might misleadingly suggest that the early years of the new nation were times of great confidence and self-congratulation. In fact, just the opposite was nearly the case. Americans knew that the historical record of the long-term success of republican governments was exceedingly poor. Previous examples and classical political theory suggested that republics almost all suffered the fate of collapsing into anarchy and then being taken over by a power-seizing tyrant.

The Philadelphia patriot BENJAMIN RUSH keenly understood the risks facing the new nation. As a result he sharply rejected the idea that the military defeat of the British meant the end of the American Revolution. "On the contrary," he wrote in 1787," nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed. It remains yet to establish and perfect our new forms of government."


The unsettled domestic issues that threatened to overturn the new republic were varied and complex. Any one of the major crisis points of the early 1790s might overturn the fragile new government. Where was the greatest threat: the challenging legal and political issues raised during the ratification of the Constitution, the disastrous economy of the 1780s, popular protests against federal policies in the west, or the varied military threats from Native Americans, the British in Canada, and war in Europe? If any one of them could have toppled the government, imagine how their combination must have made Americans fear for the future of the country.


Most of these deeply unsettling threats would be addressed by the first federal government and usually in an aggressive manner that scored decisive victory. Interestingly, however, the solutions achieved by the first wielders of federal power also helped to create the conditions that would force them from office and lead to a dramatic change in American politics by 1800. To understand how much changed between the presidential elections of George Washington (1789) and Thomas Jefferson (1800), the kinds of challenges that had to be faced in the first decade of government under the new federal Constitution must be examined.


=== The Bill of Rights 权利法案

The first national election occurred in 1789. Along with President Washington, voters elected a large number of supporters of the Constitution. In fact, almost half of the ninety-one members of the first Congress had helped to write or ratify the Constitution.

Not surprisingly, given Anti-Federalists' opposition to the strong new central government, only eight opponents of the Constitution were sent to the House of Representatives. Most Anti-Federalists concentrated their efforts in state politics.


An immediate issue that the new Congress took up was how to modify the Constitution. Representatives were responding to calls for amendments that had emerged as a chief issue during the ratification process. Crucial states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New York (among others) had all ultimately supported the Constitution — but only with the expectation that explicit protections for individual rights would be added to the highest law of the land. Now that supporters of the Constitution controlled the federal government, what would they do?

The legal tradition of having a precise statement of individual rights had deep roots in Anglo-American custom. So it's not surprising that the first Congress amended the Constitution by adding what became known as the Bill of Rights.

James Madison, now a member of Congress from Virginia, once again took the leading role crafting proposed amendments that would be sent to the states for approval. Madison skillfully reviewed numerous proposals and examples from state constitutions and ultimately selected nineteen potential amendments to the Constitution.

As one might expect, the nationalist Madison took care to make sure that none of the proposed amendments would fundamentally weaken the new central government. In the end, ten amendments were ratified in 1791.


These first ten amendments to the Constitution became known as the Bill of Rights and still stand as both the symbol and foundation of American ideals of individual liberty, LIMITED GOVERNMENT, and the rule of law. Most of the Bill of Rights concerns legal protections for those accused of crimes.

For instance, the fourth through eighth amendments provide protection from unreasonable SEARCH AND SEIZURE, the privilege against SELF-INCRIMINATION, and the right to a FAIR AND SPEEDY JURY TRIAL that will be free from unusual punishments.

The FIRST AMENDMENT, perhaps the broadest and most famous of the Bill of Rights, establishes a range of political and civil rights including those of FREE SPEECH, assembly, press, and religion.

The last two amendments, respectively, spell out that this list of individual protections is not meant to exclude other ones, and, by contrast, set forth that all powers claimed by the federal government had to be expressly stated in the Constitution.

While the Bill of Rights created no deep challenge to federal authority, it did respond to the central Anti-Federalist fear that the Constitution would unleash an oppressive central government too distant from the people to be controlled.

By responding to this opposition and following through on the broadly expressed desire for amendments that emerged during the ratification process, the Bill of Rights helped to secure broad political support for the new national government. A first major domestic issue had been successfully resolved.


The Bill of Rights remains an active force in contemporary American life as a major element of CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. The meaning of its protections remains hotly debated. For example, the privilege to bear arms to support a militia, which appears in the second amendment, produces significant political controversy today.

More sweepingly, the extension of the Bill of Rights to protect individuals from abuse not only by the federal government, but also from state and local governments remains an unsettled aspect of Constitutional interpretation.

Originally, the protections were solely meant to limit the federal government, but with the fourteenth amendment's guarantee in 1868 that no state could deprive its citizens of the protections in the Bill of Rights this original view began to be expanded. To this day the SUPREME COURT has not definitively decided if the entire Bill of Rights should always be applied to all levels of government.

=== 亚历山大·汉密尔顿, 解决战后"债务困境"

Presidents Washington ($1), Lincoln ($5), Jackson ($20), and Grant ($50) all appear on currency. But what about this guy Alexander Hamilton on the ten-spot? How did he get there? A sawbuck says you'll know the answer after reading this piece.


A major problem facing the first federal government was how to deal with the financial chaos created by the American Revolution. States had huge war debts. There was runaway inflation. Almost all areas of the economy looked dismal throughout the 1780s. Economic hard times were a major factor creating the sense of crisis that produced the stronger central government under the new Constitution.

The first issue that Hamilton tackled as Washington's SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY concerned the problem of PUBLIC CREDIT. Governments at all levels had taken on so much debt during the Revolution. The commitment to pay them back was not taken very seriously. By the late 1780s, the value of such public securities had plunged to a small fraction of their face value. In other words, state IOU's — the money borrowed to finance the Revolution — were viewed as nearly worthless.


Hamilton issued a bold proposal. The federal government should pay off all CONFEDERATION (state) debts at full value. Such action would dramatically enhance the legitimacy of the new central government. To raise money to pay off the debts, Hamilton would issue new SECURITIES bonds. Investors who had purchased these public securities could make enormous profits when the time came for the United States to pay off these new debts.

Hamilton's vision for reshaping the American economy included a federal charter for a national financial institution. He proposed a BANK OF THE UNITED STATES. Modeled along the lines of the Bank of England, a central bank would help make the new nation's economy dynamic through a more stable paper CURRENCY.

Hamilton possessed a remarkably acute economic vision. His aggressive support for manufacturing, banks, and strong public credit all became central aspects of the modern capitalist economy that would develop in the United States in the century after his death. Nevertheless, his policies were deeply controversial in their day.

Many Americans neither like Hamilton's elitist attitude nor his commitment to a British model of economic development. His pro-British foreign policy was potentially explosive in the wake of the Revolution. Hamilton favored an even stronger central government than the Constitution had created and often linked democratic impulses with potential anarchy. Finally, because the beneficiaries of his innovative economic policies were concentrated in the northeast, they threatened to stimulate divisive geographic differences in the new nation.

Regardless, Hamilton's economic philosophies became touchstones of the modern American capitalist economy.

Bet you $10 you now see why he's on the $10 bill.

=== 政府精英, 产生分歧


extraordinary divisions to the forefront of American life and politics. Strong differences about how best to maintain the benefits of the Revolution lay at the center of these conflicts. Hamilton's economic policies were among the earliest sources of tension. They sparked strong reactions not only from elected officials and ordinary farmers, but even split Washington's cabinet.

Hamilton's successful bid to CHARTER a national Bank of the United States also brought strong opposition from Jefferson. Their disagreement about the bank stemmed from sharply opposed interpretations of the Constitution. For Jefferson, such action was clearly beyond the powers granted to the federal government. In his "STRICT INTERPRETATION" of the Constitution, Jefferson pointed out that the tenth amendment required that all federal authority be expressly stated in the law. Nowhere did the Constitution allow for the federal government to create a bank.

Hamilton responded with a "LOOSE INTERPRETATION" that allowed such federal action under a clause permitting Congress to make "all Laws which shall be NECESSARY AND PROPER."

Neither side was absolutely right. The Constitution needed INTERPRETATION. In this difference, however, we can see sharply contrasting visions for the future of the republic.


Opposition to Hamilton's financial policies spread beyond the cabinet. The legislature divided about whether or not to support the Bank of the United States. This split in Congress loomed as a potential threat to the union because northern representatives overwhelmingly voted favorably, while southerners were strongly opposed. The difference stemmed from significant economic differences between the sections. Large cities, merchants, and leading financiers were much more numerous in the north and stood to benefit from Hamilton's plans.


Keen observers began to fear that sharp sectional differences might soon threaten the union. Indeed, the Bank ultimately found support in Congress through a compromise that included a commitment to build the new FEDERAL CAPITAL on the banks of the Potomac River. In part this stemmed from the fact that southern states such as Virginia had already paid off their war debt and stood to gain nothing from a central bank. While most of the commercial beneficiaries of Hamilton's policies were concentrated in the urban northeast, the political capital of WASHINGTON, D.C. would stand in the more agricultural south. By dividing the centers of economic and political power many hoped to avoid a dangerous concentration of power in any one place or region.


Their differences also extended to the branch of government that each favored. Hamilton thought a strong executive and a judiciary protected from DIRECT POPULAR INFLUENCE were essential to the health of the REPUBLIC. By contrast, Jefferson put much greater faith in democracy and felt that the truest expression of republican principles would come through the legislature, which was elected directly by the people. Their differences would become even sharper as the decade wore on.

==== 第一任美国财长 Alexander Hamilton

新成立的美国联邦政府, 面临着如何偿还当时来说是天文数字的7900万美元内外债，新大陆正濒临经济崩溃的边缘。重建国家信用，创立金融体系，完善税收制度，保护自由市场，这是华盛顿政府面临的最大的挑战.

独立战争结束后，汉密尔顿自学了三个月的法学课程就通过了律师资格考试，开始了律师行业。1784年，就在英军撤离纽约市的几个月后，汉密尔顿创建了“纽约银行”（今天的纽约梅隆银行)，他亲自制定和起草了银行的章程，它是美国历史最悠久的银行。

历史学家们认为，虽然华盛顿疏于财经金融，但是任用汉密尔顿是华盛顿政府最大的成就。

汉密尔顿在报告中说，政府现在的债务是“自由的代价”。**独立战争期间的资金来源不是靠征税，而是靠借债。其中，联邦政府的5400万负债是在国外发行的外债，2500万是各州政府向民间举借的内债。**

**管理债务最有效的办法, 是设立专项资金，把固定份额的"税收", 拨进这个账户，用这些钱按时还本付息 (用税收来还国债)。只有这样才能建立起良好的公共信用。有了信用，不但容易筹措到资金，借贷的成本也大大降低。**

**政府债券在金融市场上的流通, 为所有的人提供了投资的机会，也为市场注入了极大的流动性，**它将最终转化为财富和资本。

所以，公共信用不只是经济问题，它也是政治问题和社会问题。处理得好，“公共债务就是公共福祉”。

**新国家诞生之前，由于邦联没有"征税权"，它无力偿还外债，很多州也无力偿还内债，美国政府毫无信用。为了扭转这个局面，解决方法是:  +
第一，联邦政府将以"海关税收"为抵押，承诺偿付所有现存公债的本金和利息。如有必要，联邦将征收“酿酒税”（“威士忌税”）。 +
第二，联邦政府将把各州还没有还清的债务“接收”过来，统一管理，统一偿还。**

以上是报告的主要内容。

2月8日，众议院就此议题开始辩论。2月11日，麦迪逊发言，他表示反对汉密尔顿的第一条措施，也就是偿付债务的方法。汉密尔顿的计划很简单，那就是联邦政府向债券持有人兑现支付100%本金和利息，至于债券持有人的债券来源，政府不予问津。

*因为各州的债务都是很多年前发行的，债券最原始的持有者, 都是普通公民，特别是那些大陆军退伍老兵。当时，各州没钱给战士们发工资，只能用债券代替现金，承诺若干年后兑现。* 可是战后的经济一团糟，州政府财源吃紧，无法兑现债券。很多退伍老兵的生活难以为继，人们对州政府的信用大打折扣，债券价值为此而暴跌。在这种情况下，*很多老兵和其他持有人, 不得不以远远低于面额的价钱将债券出手，换取现金维持生活。*

**那些低价收购债券的投机家和银行家, 这些债券持有者，他们期待政府最后能还债，**联邦政府成立以后，这种投机活动变得异常活跃，**有些投机家跑到偏远的农村，以低价把债券从老兵手中套出来，转手获利。**麦迪逊认为：汉密尔顿的计划无疑使投机行为更猖獗，财富集中到少数人手中，这不利于社会公平。

对此，**麦迪逊提出了自己的“区分”方案。他认为，投机者可以得到在汉密尔顿政策出台前, 债券升值的利润，但仅此而已。政策出台后的所有利润, 归原始持有者。**简单地说，比如：一张100美元面额的债券, 跌到50美元时，原始持有者把它卖给了投机者。随着经济渐渐恢复，债券涨到60美元。这时，汉密尔顿的计划通过了，债券金额又回到了面额的100美元，因为政府要付100%面额。在这100美元中，60美元付给现在的持有者（投机者），因为他们拥有“合同的权利”；40美元付给原始持有者（退伍老兵），因为他们拥有“正义的权利”。

对此，**汉密尔顿反驳道：第一、在各州政府无法兑现退伍老兵的薪水时，投机者从退伍军人那里廉价得到债券，在某种程度来说，解决了退伍军人的燃眉之急，但于此同时投机者们也承担成着风险。**市场原则是：证券的购买者拥有获得未来一切收益的权利，政府如果对此插手干涉，就构成了对自由权和财产权的侵犯；**第二、即便真要执行麦迪逊的方案，也是困难重重，因为债券在此期间，已经多次转手，即便是政府为此花了大量人力、财力也无法做到麦迪逊所主张的“正义权利”。**为此，汉密尔顿的关于偿还债务方案得到了商界、银行界以及北方各州的赞同，这些利益团体成了美国建国后最初的“院外游说团”，他们向议员们不断兜售汉密尔顿的方案。2月20日，众议院投票表决麦迪逊的“区分”议案, 众议院以36:13否决了麦迪逊的提议，汉密尔顿在这个方案上获得了胜利。

但是汉密尔顿的"联邦政府接管各州债务"的议案，在4月12日遭到了众议院31:29的微弱优势否决。在麦迪逊看来，首先**联邦政府接管所有的债务，意味着将全国的债务均摊到各州身上，这对南方各州，特别是弗吉尼亚这样农业大州明显不利。**

**对战争期间的积累债务处理，各州情况不同，除了南卡罗来纳州以外，弗吉尼亚和其他南方各州在战后迅速恢复了出口农作物，很快付清了大部分债务。北方各州就不是这样了，各州都欠着巨额债务，**举步维艰。**而汉密尔顿的提议无异于将北方的债务转嫁到南方身上。**

其次，汉密尔顿的方案侧重于商业、银行业，而没有将重心放在农业方面。**1790年的美国是农业国，90%的GDP来自农业，95%的人口住在农村，议员们的视野自然会面向广大的农庄，尤其是南方各州。而汉密尔顿的方案明显有利于北方各州。**这次国会的交锋标示着，“国父们”虽然在建国理念上曾经志同道合，但是在治国策略上开始分道扬镳，同时也加深了农业与工商业、南方与北方、联邦与州之间的裂痕，这为后来的南北战争埋下了隐患。

汉密尔顿出任财政部长时为新国家定了四个目标：一是提高公共信用；二是健全海关管理；三是完善税收制度；四是建立中央银行。

他向国会提出建立海岸缉私队，也就是后来的“海岸警卫队”。*国会通过法案创建第一支武装缉私船队，归财政部管。这项法案堵塞了走私渠道，国家增加了关税收入.*

汉密尔顿提出了要建立新大陆有史以来第一个相当于中央银行功能的“合众国银行”。当时，美国没有统一的货币。虽然国会创立了美元，但大家更愿用欧洲各国的货币. +
汉密尔顿借鉴英国和荷兰的模式，**他的设想是建立中央银行的启动资金1000万美元，政府出200万美元，通过销售银行股票, 从私人那里融资800万美元。他认为这种模式运作高效，虽有私人资本介入，但是政府是大股东，银行的决策以及运行都由政府执行。**在汉密尔顿看来，中央银行将成为维护公共信用的工具。
