降低有意识的推理, 可以帮助声音模式识别.

儿童通常比成人更容易学习新语言，但原因尚不清楚。一些人假设掌握一种语言需要无意识地吸收微妙的模式，而成年人的高级意识推理会干扰。新的研究表明，事实上，成年人可能只是为了他们自己的利益而太聪明了。

... 那些解决了困难版本的人后来声称有更大的认知疲劳——但在随后的语言任务中表现更好。研究人员假设，疲倦的学习者对单词规则的意识分析较少：他们可以像孩子一样自由学习。

根特大学心理学家 Eleonore Smalle 是这两篇论文的带头人，她根据她团队的发现提出了建议。她说，当开始学习一门语言时，让自己沉浸在它的声音中，即使——或者尤其是——在分心的时候。 “一边听意大利语播客，一边喝一杯好酒，”她笑着建议道。 “为什么不？这可能会有所帮助。”
