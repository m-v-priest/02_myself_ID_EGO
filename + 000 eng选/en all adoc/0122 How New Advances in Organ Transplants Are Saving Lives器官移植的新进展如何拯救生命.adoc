器官移植的新进展如何拯救生命


image:/img/0003.jpg[,20%]

More than 100,000 people in the U.S. /are currently on waiting lists /for an organ transplant, the vast majority of them for kidneys.
Every day /17 people die waiting for a transplant. +

[.my2]
美国有超过100,000人, 目前正在等待器官移植，其中绝大多数是肾脏移植。
每天有 17 人在等待移植过程中死亡。 +

`主` The persistent 连绵的；持续的；反复出现的, tragic 悲惨的；悲痛的；可悲的 situation of people dying (v.) on long waiting lists /`谓` has motivated Montgomery and several other scientists /to begin a bold experiment: *transplanting* (v.) organs from other species — specifically, genetically _modified pigs_ — *into* humans. +

In the past two years /they have made significant progress in these operations, known as xenotransplants 异种移植. The term has its roots in the Greek word xenos, for “alien” or “foreign.” +
In tests this year, pig kidneys functioned (v.) in human bodies /for up to two months without failing. +

[.my2]
人们在漫长的等待名单上死亡的持续悲惨状况, 促使蒙哥马利和其他几位科学家, 开始了一项大胆的实验：将其他物种（特别是转基因猪）的器官, 移植到人类身上。
在过去的两年里，他们在这些被称为"异种移植"的手术中, 取得了重大进展。该词源于希腊语 xenos，意为“外星人”或“外国人”。
在今年的测试中，猪肾在人体中可以发挥长达两个月的功能, 而没有出现故障。 +


[.my1]
.案例
====
.xenotransplant
N an operation in which an organ or tissue is transferred from one animal to another of a different species 异种移植
====



I can *relate 联系；使有联系；把…联系起来 to* the anxiety of waiting for an organ that may never come.
My mother was diagnosed in 2019 with _pulmonary 肺的；肺部的；与肺有关的 fibrosis_ (n.)纤维化, a progressive and deadly lung-scarring 结疤；给……留下伤痕 illness with a two- to five-year prognosis （对病情的）预断，预后, on average, after diagnosis. +

[.my2]
我能理解等待可能永远不会到来的器官的焦虑。
我的母亲于 2019 年被诊断出患有"肺纤维化"，这是一种进行性且致命的肺部疤痕疾病，诊断后平均预后为两到五年。


[.my1]
.案例
====
.pulmonary fibrosis
肺纤维化 : 正常的肺泡组织被损坏后, 经过异常修复, 导致结构异常（疤痕形成）。"肺纤维化"严重影响人体呼吸功能，表现为干咳、进行性呼吸困难（自觉气不够用），且随着病情和肺部损伤的加重，患者呼吸功能不断恶化。

.prognosis
(n.)1.( medical 医) an opinion, based on medical experience, of the likely development of a disease or an illness （对病情的）预断，预后 +
2.( formal ) a judgement about how sth is likely to develop in the future 预测；预言；展望 +
--> 来自pro-,向前，提前，-gn,知道，词源同 know,cognizant.-osis, 状态后缀。引申词义预断，预测。
====

The disease has no cure (n.)（解决问题、改善糟糕情况等的）措施，对策, but a lung transplant offered (v.) the possibility of extending her life. +
Like many in need, we had to wait /until she was sick enough to be listed for transplant (if she even qualified) /while hoping that she would receive an organ before she got too sick to survive the surgery. +

[.my2]
这种疾病无法治愈，但肺移植提供了延长她生命的可能性。 +
像许多需要帮助的人一样，我们必须等到她病情严重到可以被列入移植名单（如果她符合资格），同时希望她能在她病得太严重而无法在手术中生存之前, 接受器官。 +


[.my1]
.案例
====
.if she even qualified 中的 even
chatGpt : 在这个句子中，"even" 被用作副词，用于强调可能性的不确定性, 或条件的不确定性。在这里，"if she even qualified" 的意思是表示她是否符合条件是一个甚至不确定的情况，即可能她甚至不符合条件。这强调了等待的不确定性和困难，因为不确定是否她符合器官移植的资格。
====

Most transplant organs come from _deceased (a.)死去了的；已死的；亡故的 donors_, but kidneys and parts of other organs, including livers, can be obtained /through the generosity (n.)慷慨；大方；宽宏大量 of _living donors_. +

The other major source of organs — deceased 已故的 donors — relies on people who have suffered untimely (a.) 过早的；不到时间的；突然的 deaths /under circumstances that allow their organs to be retrieved (v.)取回；索回 *in time* for transplantation. +
These are usually victims of accidents or brain injuries 伤害; 损害 who have been declared brain-dead /but whose other organs will keep working *as long as* 只要……就 the body is kept [on life support]. +

[.my2]
大多数移植器官来自已故的捐赠者，但肾脏和其他器官的一部分（包括肝脏）可以通过活体捐赠者的慷慨获得。
器官的另一个主要来源——已故捐献者——依赖于那些过早死亡的人，他们的器官可以及时取出进行移植。
这些人通常是事故或脑损伤的受害者，他们被宣布脑死亡，但只要身体靠生命维持系统维持，其他器官就会继续工作。

Yet the safety improvements have also decreased （使大小、数量等）减少，减小，降低 the number of organs available for transplant. +

[.my2]
2022 年，美国有近 15,000 名已登记器官捐献者, 或其家人同意的死者, 提供了器官。 +
从历史上看，很大一部分已故捐赠者, 都是机动车事故的受害者。
值得庆幸的是，随着交通和车辆安全的改善，车祸的生还率越来越高。
然而，安全性的提高, 也减少了可用于移植的器官数量。 +

One development has been driving an increase in donor organs, but it’s nothing to celebrate. It’s the opioid (n.a)类鸦片活性肽 epidemic (n.)（迅速的）泛滥，蔓延 . +

[.my2]
一项进展推动了捐赠器官的增加，但这并不值得庆祝。 这是阿片类药物的流行。 死于吸毒过量的人, 现在占捐赠者的很大一部分——从 2000 年捐赠者的 1% , 上升到 2017 年的 13% 以上——而且危机似乎不会很快缓解。 +


[.my1]
.案例
====
.abate
--> 前缀a-同ad-. -bate同beat, 指打压下去。
====

“Our success right now /is based on a failure in our society,” Montgomery says. +

`主` The increase in _transplanted organs_ from people who died from overdoses （一次用药）过量 /`系`  is a result #of# the scale of those deaths, as well as #of# advances in medicine that have *made* more of those organs *usable*. +

[.my2]
“我们现在的成功, 是基于我们社会的失败，”蒙哥马利说。  +
过量服用药物而死亡的人的器官移植数量增加，一方面是因为死亡人数庞大，另一方面是因为医学进步使更多的器官可用。 +


[.my1]

== How New Advances in Organ Transplants Are Saving Lives

More than 100,000 people in the U.S. are currently on waiting lists for an organ transplant, the vast majority of them for kidneys. Every day 17 people die waiting for a transplant.

The persistent, tragic situation of people dying on long waiting lists has motivated Montgomery and several other scientists to begin a bold experiment: transplanting organs from other species—specifically, genetically modified pigs—into humans. In the past two years they have made significant progress in these operations, known as xenotransplants. The term has its roots in the Greek word xenos, for “alien” or “foreign.” In tests this year, pig kidneys functioned in human bodies for up to two months without failing.

I can relate to the anxiety of waiting for an organ that may never come. My mother was diagnosed in 2019 with pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and deadly lung-scarring illness with a two- to five-year prognosis, on average, after diagnosis. The disease has no cure, but a lung transplant offered the possibility of extending her life. Like many in need, we had to wait until she was sick enough to be listed for transplant (if she even qualified) while hoping that she would receive an organ before she got too sick to survive the surgery.

Most transplant organs come from deceased donors, but kidneys and parts of other organs, including livers, can be obtained through the generosity of living donors.


The other major source of organs—deceased donors—relies on people who have suffered untimely deaths under circumstances that allow their organs to be retrieved in time for transplantation. These are usually victims of accidents or brain injuries who have been declared brain-dead but whose other organs will keep working as long as the body is kept on life support. Nearly 15,000 deceased people who were registered organ donors or whose families consented on their behalf provided organs in 2022 in the U.S. Historically, a large proportion of deceased donors have been victims of motor vehicle crashes. As traffic and vehicle safety have improved, crashes have become—thankfully—increasingly survivable. Yet the safety improvements have also decreased the number of organs available for transplant.

One development has been driving an increase in donor organs, but it's nothing to celebrate. It's the opioid epidemic. People who die of drug overdoses now constitute a significant fraction of donors—rising from 1 percent of donors in 2000 to more than 13 percent in 2017—and it doesn't seem like the crisis will abate anytime soon. “Our success right now is based on a failure in our society,” Montgomery says. The increase in transplanted organs from people who died from overdoses is a result of the scale of those deaths, as well as of advances in medicine that have made more of those organs usable. Some people who suffer from opioid addiction are also infected with hepatitis C, a disease that causes severe liver inflammation. Until a few years ago, organs from such donors were considered unusable because of the risk of infecting the recipient. But new antiviral drugs have made the disease treatable.

Despite these advances, there are still not enough organs for all who need one. So Montgomery and other scientists have begun to explore a more plentiful source of organs by growing them in animals bred for this purpose.

it became clear that better immunosuppression alone would not solve the problem.

using pigs, which are plentiful and already bred for human use, was considered more ethically acceptable than using nonhuman primates. Revivicor's scientists bred a line of pigs in which they knocked out, or deactivated, the alpha-gal gene, which causes the animals to make a sugar that prompts an immune response in humans.

surgeons at the University of Maryland School of Medicine transplanted a Revivicor pig heart into a man named David Bennett, Sr., making headlines.

The transplanted heart worked for nearly two months before failing. It's not entirely clear why the heart failed; the cause might have been an undetected pig virus, although an analysis the University of Maryland team published in the Lancet suggested that runaway inflammation and reduced immunosuppression might also have played roles.

In 2021 Montgomery and his colleagues at NYU Langone and transplant surgeon Jayme Locke and her colleagues at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) separately transplanted pig kidneys into people who had suffered brain death—known as decedents—with the families' consent.

In the first two NYU surgeries, the kidney was attached to the recipient's upper leg near the groin, where it was more accessible for monitoring, and then connected to the leg arteries and veins. The UAB team transplanted its kidney into the decedent's abdomen. All the transplanted kidneys produced urine—a sign of healthy kidney function. The team ended the experiments after several days, but in that time the organs showed no immediate signs of rejection.

In July 2023 NYU invited me to observe its third pig kidney xenotransplant into a human decedent. I followed the team as far as the surgical floor—I couldn't go into the operating room because of the risk of being exposed to a pig virus. Pigs can carry viruses such as porcine cytomegalovirus, the one that was detected in Bennett, the person who received a pig heart transplant in 2022.


We waited anxiously as Montgomery and his colleagues connected the pig kidney's blood vessels and ureter to the decedent's. A pig thymus gland—a source of immune cells—was also transplanted to help reduce the risk of immune rejection. As the doctors removed the clamps on the new organ's blood vessels, the kidney started making urine. The graft was working.

Unlike previous xenotransplants, which were slated to go on for only a few days, this one was planned to last for a month as long as the body and the organ were working without signs of irreversible organ rejection. The procedure went better than expected. At the end of August the experiment was extended for another month. The kidney showed mild signs of rejection, which were reversed before the experiment ended.

Although experiments like these provide useful data, proving that such transplants are safe and effective will require clinical trials in live patients.


Since the 1970s the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has been the sole entity responsible for matching organ donors and recipients in the U.S. It works with several dozen nonprofit groups contracted by the Department of Health and Human Services to get organs from donors to hospitals. But flaws in this system, such as lack of accountability and outdated software, have limited its effectiveness. In March the Biden administration announced plans to modernize the transplant system by making it more competitive, and in July the U.S. Congress passed legislation to break up UNOS's monopoly.
