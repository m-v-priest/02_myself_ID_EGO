== How New Advances in Organ Transplants Are Saving Lives

More than 100,000 people in the U.S. are currently on waiting lists for an organ transplant, the vast majority of them for kidneys. Every day 17 people die waiting for a transplant.

The persistent, tragic situation of people dying on long waiting lists has motivated Montgomery and several other scientists to begin a bold experiment: transplanting organs from other species—specifically, genetically modified pigs—into humans. In the past two years they have made significant progress in these operations, known as xenotransplants. The term has its roots in the Greek word xenos, for “alien” or “foreign.” In tests this year, pig kidneys functioned in human bodies for up to two months without failing.

I can relate to the anxiety of waiting for an organ that may never come. My mother was diagnosed in 2019 with pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and deadly lung-scarring illness with a two- to five-year prognosis, on average, after diagnosis. The disease has no cure, but a lung transplant offered the possibility of extending her life. Like many in need, we had to wait until she was sick enough to be listed for transplant (if she even qualified) while hoping that she would receive an organ before she got too sick to survive the surgery.

Most transplant organs come from deceased donors, but kidneys and parts of other organs, including livers, can be obtained through the generosity of living donors.


The other major source of organs—deceased donors—relies on people who have suffered untimely deaths under circumstances that allow their organs to be retrieved in time for transplantation. These are usually victims of accidents or brain injuries who have been declared brain-dead but whose other organs will keep working as long as the body is kept on life support. Nearly 15,000 deceased people who were registered organ donors or whose families consented on their behalf provided organs in 2022 in the U.S. Historically, a large proportion of deceased donors have been victims of motor vehicle crashes. As traffic and vehicle safety have improved, crashes have become—thankfully—increasingly survivable. Yet the safety improvements have also decreased the number of organs available for transplant.

One development has been driving an increase in donor organs, but it's nothing to celebrate. It's the opioid epidemic. People who die of drug overdoses now constitute a significant fraction of donors—rising from 1 percent of donors in 2000 to more than 13 percent in 2017—and it doesn't seem like the crisis will abate anytime soon. “Our success right now is based on a failure in our society,” Montgomery says. The increase in transplanted organs from people who died from overdoses is a result of the scale of those deaths, as well as of advances in medicine that have made more of those organs usable. Some people who suffer from opioid addiction are also infected with hepatitis C, a disease that causes severe liver inflammation. Until a few years ago, organs from such donors were considered unusable because of the risk of infecting the recipient. But new antiviral drugs have made the disease treatable.

Despite these advances, there are still not enough organs for all who need one. So Montgomery and other scientists have begun to explore a more plentiful source of organs by growing them in animals bred for this purpose.

it became clear that better immunosuppression alone would not solve the problem.

using pigs, which are plentiful and already bred for human use, was considered more ethically acceptable than using nonhuman primates. Revivicor's scientists bred a line of pigs in which they knocked out, or deactivated, the alpha-gal gene, which causes the animals to make a sugar that prompts an immune response in humans.

surgeons at the University of Maryland School of Medicine transplanted a Revivicor pig heart into a man named David Bennett, Sr., making headlines.

The transplanted heart worked for nearly two months before failing. It's not entirely clear why the heart failed; the cause might have been an undetected pig virus, although an analysis the University of Maryland team published in the Lancet suggested that runaway inflammation and reduced immunosuppression might also have played roles.

In 2021 Montgomery and his colleagues at NYU Langone and transplant surgeon Jayme Locke and her colleagues at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) separately transplanted pig kidneys into people who had suffered brain death—known as decedents—with the families' consent.

In the first two NYU surgeries, the kidney was attached to the recipient's upper leg near the groin, where it was more accessible for monitoring, and then connected to the leg arteries and veins. The UAB team transplanted its kidney into the decedent's abdomen. All the transplanted kidneys produced urine—a sign of healthy kidney function. The team ended the experiments after several days, but in that time the organs showed no immediate signs of rejection.

In July 2023 NYU invited me to observe its third pig kidney xenotransplant into a human decedent. I followed the team as far as the surgical floor—I couldn't go into the operating room because of the risk of being exposed to a pig virus. Pigs can carry viruses such as porcine cytomegalovirus, the one that was detected in Bennett, the person who received a pig heart transplant in 2022.


We waited anxiously as Montgomery and his colleagues connected the pig kidney's blood vessels and ureter to the decedent's. A pig thymus gland—a source of immune cells—was also transplanted to help reduce the risk of immune rejection. As the doctors removed the clamps on the new organ's blood vessels, the kidney started making urine. The graft was working.

Unlike previous xenotransplants, which were slated to go on for only a few days, this one was planned to last for a month as long as the body and the organ were working without signs of irreversible organ rejection. The procedure went better than expected. At the end of August the experiment was extended for another month. The kidney showed mild signs of rejection, which were reversed before the experiment ended.

Although experiments like these provide useful data, proving that such transplants are safe and effective will require clinical trials in live patients.


Since the 1970s the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has been the sole entity responsible for matching organ donors and recipients in the U.S. It works with several dozen nonprofit groups contracted by the Department of Health and Human Services to get organs from donors to hospitals. But flaws in this system, such as lack of accountability and outdated software, have limited its effectiveness. In March the Biden administration announced plans to modernize the transplant system by making it more competitive, and in July the U.S. Congress passed legislation to break up UNOS's monopoly.
