== Tuberculosis kills more people than any other pathogenic illness

IN 1882, WHEN Robert Koch discovered *Mycobacterium 分直杆菌属细菌 tuberculosis* 肺结核；结核病, the microbe  微生物 that causes tuberculosis, the disease caused *one in seven deaths* in America and Europe.

Transmitted through *droplets  小滴 from coughs* 咳嗽, sneezes 打喷嚏 or just talking, tuberculosis felled  击倒，打倒（某人）; 砍伐（树木） rich and poor alike.

In the century that followed, TB (*as* the illness *is called for short* 简略的；缩写的) beat a retreat （仓促）逃走；（慌忙）撤退 thanks to antibiotics and a vaccine that protected infants 婴儿；幼儿. By the 1990s *wiping 擦,拭,抹去（旧事） it out completely* seemed *tantalisingly 挑逗性地,撩人地 within reach*.

1882 年，当罗伯特·科赫 (Robert Koch) 发现结核分枝杆菌（Mycobacterium tuberculosis）时，这种微生物会导致结核病，这种疾病导致美国和欧洲七分之一的死亡。肺结核通过咳嗽、打喷嚏或只是说话时产生的飞沫传播，无论贫富，都会受到肺结核的影响。在接下来的一个世纪里，由于抗生素和保护婴儿的疫苗，结核病（这种疾病的简称）战胜了疾病。到 1990 年代，彻底消灭它似乎触手可及。

Since then, however, *progress has been glacial* (a.)冰河时代的,冰川的. New cases are falling by just 1-2% a year. Today, M. tuberculosis kills more people than any other single pathogen 病原体 (see chart).

*One reason TB has been hard to crack* is that M. tuberculosis has an unusual life cycle. When someone inhales the bug it is [underline]#either# killed by the immune system right away [underline]#or# *takes up 进入，占据（位置） residence* 住所；住房,居住；定居 in the lungs. Instead of causing immediate symptoms, though, it usually remains dormant (a.)休眠的；蛰伏的；暂停活动的 —a state called *latent 潜伏的；隐藏的 infection* 传染；感染 that is not contagious （疾病）接触传染的.

About *a quarter of* the world’s population has such latent TB. But only about 10% of those so infected ever 不断地；总是；始终 go on to develop symptoms. Often, those who do have weakened 虚弱 immune systems.

People infected with HIV *are at particular risk* (about 40% of deaths among *HIV-positive 阳性的；证明…存在的 individuals* 个人 are caused by TB). `主` Others with higher than average risk of becoming symptomatic `系`  are the malnourished 营养不良的, smokers and alcoholics 酗酒者.

然而，从那以后，进展一直很缓慢。新病例每年仅下降 1-2%。今天，结核分枝杆菌杀死的人数超过任何其他单一病原体（见图表）。

结核病难以攻克的原因之一是结核分枝杆菌的生命周期不同寻常。当有人吸入这种病毒时，它要么立即被免疫系统杀死，要么在肺部定居。不过，它不会立即引起症状，而是通常保持休眠状态 ——这种状态称为潜伏感染，不会传染。世界上大约四分之一的人口, 患有这种潜伏性结核病。但只有大约 10% 的感染者, 会继续出现症状。通常，那些免疫系统较弱的人。感染 HIV 的人处于特别危险之中（大约 40% 的 HIV 阳性个体死亡, 是由结核病引起的）。其他出现症状的风险高于平均水平的人, 是营养不良者、吸烟者和酗酒者。

自 1990 年代以来，两项发展使抗击结核病的斗争变得复杂。一是艾滋病毒的传播。另一个是结核分枝杆菌耐药菌株的出现。 2018 年的新病例中有近 50 万例无法用标准一线药物治疗。其中 6% 的病例被归类为广泛耐药——这意味着很少或根本没有药物对他们有效。

In the end, the biggest hope for beating TB is a new vaccine. The only one now available is BCG (Bacillus 杆菌（有些可致病） Calmette-Guerin), which goes back to 1921. It is effective in preventing *the most severe forms of* TB in children, such as *brain inflammation* 发炎；炎症. But *it is unreliable against* TB of the lungs — *the most common form of the illness* in adults.

/bəˈsɪləs/ a type of bacteria. There are several types of bacillus , some of which cause disease. 杆菌（有些可致病）

1908年，细菌学家阿尔伯特·卡米特（Albert Calmette）和兽医卡米尔·介林（Camille Guerin）合作，探索开发一种疫苗来对抗结核病。


最后，战胜结核病的最大希望是新疫苗。现在唯一可用的是 BCG（卡介苗），它的历史可以追溯到 1921 年。它可以有效预防儿童最严重的结核病，例如脑部炎症。但它对肺结核（成人最常见的疾病形式）并不可靠。
