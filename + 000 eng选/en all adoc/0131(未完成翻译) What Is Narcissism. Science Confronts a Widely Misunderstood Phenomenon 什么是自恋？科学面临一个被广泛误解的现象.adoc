== What Is Narcissism  (n.)自我陶醉，自赏，自恋（尤指对自己的容貌） ? Science Confronts (v.) a Widely Misunderstood 遭误解的；不为人理解的 Phenomenon 什么是自恋？科学面临一个被广泛误解的现象


[.my1]
.案例
====
.narcissism +
[ U] ( formal disapproving) the habit of admiring yourself too much, especially your appearance 自我陶醉，自赏，自恋（尤指对自己的容貌） +
--> 来自古希腊神话，英俊青年Narcissus拒绝了神界第一美女Echo的爱，却爱上了自己在水中的倒影，不幸溺水而死，后用于心理学名词，自恋，孤芳自赏。

...But *chances are* you've encountered a narcissist 自恋者,自我陶醉者, and they looked nothing like Trump, Musk or Modi.

*Up to* 6 percent of the U.S. population, mostly men, is estimated to have had *narcissistic 自我陶醉的; 自恋的 personality disorder* during some period of their lives.

And the condition manifests (v.)表明，清楚显示（尤指情感、态度或品质）; 显现；使人注意到 in *confoundingly 令人困惑地 different ways*.

People with narcissism (n.)自我陶醉，自赏，自恋（尤指对自己的容貌） “may be grandiose 华而不实的；浮夸的；不切实际的 or self-loathing 自我讨厌的, *extraverted* 外向的 or *socially isolated*, *captains of industry* or *unable to maintain steady 稳的；平稳的；稳固的 employment* 工作；职业；受雇, 就业, *model citizens* or *prone (a.) 易于遭受；有做（坏事）的倾向 to antisocial activities*,” according to *a review paper* on diagnosing (v.) the disorder.

...但你很可能遇到过一个自恋者，他们看起来一点也不像特朗普、马斯克或莫迪。据估计，高达 6% 的美国人口（主要是男性）在一生中的某个时期, 患有自恋型人格障碍。而且这种情况以令人困惑的不同方式表现出来。根据一篇诊断自恋症的评论论文，自恋者“可能是'浮夸的'或'自我厌恶的'，'外向的'或'社会孤立的'，'工业领袖'或'无法维持稳定的就业'，'模范公民'或'容易进行反社会活动'”。

临床医生注意到, 自恋者在几个方面有所不同。他们可能运作得非常好，拥有成功的职业生涯和充满活力的社交生活，也可能非常糟糕。他们可能（也可能没有）患有其他疾病，从抑郁症到反社会人格。尽管大多数人都熟悉自恋的“浮夸”版本——表现为渴望关注的傲慢自大的人，但这种疾病也以“脆弱”或“隐蔽”的形式出现，个体会遭受内心的痛苦和波动。在自尊心上。这些表面上的对立, 有一个共同之处，那就是"对自身的极度关注"。

`主` Most psychologists who treat (v.)医疗；医治；治疗 patients `谓` say that grandiosity 宏伟；夸张 and vulnerability 脆弱性,易损性 *coexist (v.)同时存在，共存 in the same individual*, *showing up* （使）看得见，变得明显，显现出来 in different situations.

Among academic psychologists, however, many contend (v.)（尤指在争论中）声称，主张，认为 that these two traits （人的个性的）特征，特性，特点 do not always overlap （物体）部分重叠，交叠.

This debate *has raged (v.)猛烈地继续；激烈进行; 发怒；怒斥 for decades* without resolution, most likely because of a conundrum 令人迷惑的难题；复杂难解的问题: vulnerability is almost always present (v.) in a therapist's office, but `主` individuals *high in grandiosity* 宏伟；夸张 `谓` are unlikely to *show up* for treatment.

But “`主` *coming up with* 找到（答案）；拿出（一笔钱等） an accurate and comprehensive 全部的；所有的；（几乎）无所不包的；详尽的 diagnosis `谓` would require *a full battery 一系列；一批；一群 of* psychological and neuropsychological tests *that he'll never sit for*,” she notes 指出；特别提到 in her book on the former president.


[.my1]
.案例

大多数治疗患者的心理学家表示，"夸大"和"脆弱"同时存在于同一个人身上，在不同的情况下表现出来。然而，在学术心理学家中，许多人认为这两种特征并不总是重叠。这场争论已经持续了数十年而没有解决，很可能是因为一个难题：治疗师的办公室里几乎总是存在"脆弱性"，但自大的人不太可能出现接受治疗。心理学家玛丽·特朗普, 根据家族史和密切观察推断，她的叔叔唐纳德·特朗普符合自恋的标准，也可能符合"反社会人格障碍"的标准，其中最极端的是"反社会人格障碍"。但她在关于这位前总统的书中指出，“做出准确而全面的诊断, 需要进行全套的心理和神经心理学测试，而他永远不会接受这些测试”。
====

Now brain science is *contributing to* a better understanding of narcissism. It's unlikely to *resolve the debate*, but *preliminary (a.)预备性的；初步的；开始的 studies* are coming down *on the side of* the clinicians: vulnerability *indeed seems to be* the hidden underside of grandiosity.


[.my1]

现在，脑科学正在有助于更好地理解自恋。这不太可能解决争论，但初步研究显示临床医生站在一边："脆弱"似乎确实是"浮夸"背后隐藏的一面。

The 1980 edition of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual* of *Mental Disorders* (DSM), the main reference *used (v.) by clinicians* in the U.S., *reflected this insight* by including *vulnerable features* in *its definition of NPD*, although it emphasized *the grandiose  华而不实的；浮夸的；不切实际的 ones*. +
1980 年版的《精神疾病诊断与统计手册》(DSM) 是美国临床医生使用的主要参考资料，它通过在 NPD 定义中纳入"脆弱特征", 来反映这一见解，尽管它强调了"浮夸"的性格特征。 +

But some psychiatrists *contended （尤指在争论中）声称，主张，认为 that* the vulnerability criteria (判断的) 标准 *overlapped (v.)（范围方面）部分重叠 too much with* those of other personality disorders. +
但一些精神病学家认为，"脆弱性"标准, 与其他人格障碍的标准, 有太多重叠。 +

Borderline personality disorder (BPD), in particular 尤其；特别；格外, shares (v.) with 有同样的感情（或想法、经历等） *NPD characteristics 特征 of vulnerability* such as *difficulty managing (v.) emotions*, *sensitivity to* criticism, and *unstable relationships*. +
尤其是"边缘性人格障碍"（BPD），与 NPD 一样具有脆弱性，例如难以管理情绪、对批评敏感以, 及不稳定的关系。 +

Subsequent versions of the DSM therefore *placed even more weight on* grandiose features — such as *an exaggerated 夸张的；夸大的；言过其实的 sense of self-importance*, a preoccupation 盘算；思虑；长久思考的事情 with *fantasies 幻想 of* unlimited success and power, *an excessive 过分的；过度的 need* for admiration  钦佩；赞赏；羡慕 and a lack of empathy 同感；共鸣；同情. +
因此，DSM 的后续版本更加重视"浮夸"的特征，例如"夸大的自我重要感"、老是保持着幻想能有"无限的成功和权力"、对"获得钦佩"的过度需求, 以及缺乏同理心。 +


`主` this focus (n.) on grandiosity `谓` did not accurately represent *what he was seeing* in narcissistic patients. +
这种对浮夸的关注, 并不能准确地代表他在自恋患者身上看到的情况。 +

*It was completely ignoring* what typically drives (v.) patients to come to therapy (n.)治疗；疗法, which is vulnerability and distress 忧虑；悲伤；痛苦. +
它完全忽视了通常促使患者接受治疗的因素，即"脆弱性"和"痛苦"。 +
 +
enormous variability in *how mental health practitioners （尤指医学或法律界的）从业人员 were conceptualizing (v.)构思；使形成观念；将…概念化（为…） NPD*, with dozens of labels for the ways in which narcissism expressed itself. +
心理健康从业者对 NPD 的概念存在巨大差异，自恋的表达方式有数十种标签。 +

But there was also *a common thread* 线索；脉络；思绪；思路；贯穿的主线: descriptions of *both grandiose and vulnerable ways* in which *the disorder showed up* （使）看得见，变得明显，显现出来. +
但也有一个共同点：对这种疾病表现出的"夸张性"和"脆弱性"的方式的描述。 +


researchers have found that *both dimensions of narcissism* are linked to what psychologists call “antagonism  (n.)对立情绪；对抗情绪；敌对；敌意,” which includes selfishness, deceitfulness 不诚实；欺诈 and callousness 麻木不仁. +
研究人员发现，自恋的两个维度, 都与心理学家所说的“对抗”有关，其中包括自私、欺骗和冷酷。 +


[.my1]
.案例
====
.callous
/ˈkæləs/ +
(a.) not caring about other people's feelings or suffering 冷酷无情的；无同情心的；冷漠的 +
--> 词源同callus, 老茧，硬的。比喻无感情的，冷漠的。原始印欧语词根 kal（硬）
====

But grandiosity 自大 *is associated with* being assertive (a.)坚定自信的；坚决主张的 and *attention  注意；专心；留心；注意力 seeking* 寻求关注, whereas vulnerability *tends to involve* neuroticism 神经质; 具有不稳定、焦虑及有侵略性等的特征 and suffering from anxiety, depression and self-consciousness. +
但自大与自信, 和"寻求关注"有关; 而脆弱, 则往往涉及神经质以及焦虑、抑郁和自我意识的困扰。 +

*Vulnerable narcissism* also more often *goes along with* self-harm (which can include hairpulling, cutting, burning and *related behaviors* that are also found in people with BPD) and risk of suicide *than* the grandiose form. +
与"夸张性的自恋"相比，"脆弱的自恋"也更常伴随着自残（包括拔头发、剪头发、烧头发和相关行为，这些行为也出现在边缘性人格障碍患者身上）和自杀风险。 +
 +
The two manifestations 显示；表明；表示;（幽灵的）显现，显灵 of narcissism *are also linked to* different kinds of problems in relationships. +
自恋的两种表现, 也与"人际关系障碍问题"中的不同类型, 有关。 +

In grandiose states, people with NPD *may be more vindictive (a.)想复仇的；报复性的；怀恨的 and domineering (a.)专横的；盛气凌人的 toward others*, whereas *in vulnerable phases* they may be more withdrawn (a.)沉默寡言的；怕羞的；内向的 and exploitable 可开发的；可利用的. +
在自大性的类型中,，患有自恋型人格障碍的人, 可能会对他人更加报复和专横，而在脆弱的阶段，他们可能会更加孤僻和容易被利用。 +


Jacob Skidmore, a 23-year-old with NPD, says he often *flips (v.)（使）快速翻转，迅速翻动 from* feeling grandiose *to* vulnerable, sometimes multiple times a day. +
雅各布·斯基德莫尔 (Jacob Skidmore) 是一位 23 岁的 NPD 患者，他表示自己常常会从自大到脆弱，有时一天会发生好几次。 +

If he’s *getting positive attention* from others or *achieves his goals*, he experiences (v.) grandiose “highs” when he feels confident and secure. +
如果他得到了别人的积极关注或实现了自己的目标，当他感到自信和安全时，他就会体验到巨大的“高潮”。 +
 +

But when these sources of ego boosts — something *he refers to as* “self-esteem  自尊（心） juice” — dry up, he finds himself *slipping (v.)滑倒；滑跤 into lows* when an overwhelming feeling of shame *might stop him from* even leaving his home. +
但当这些自我提升的源泉——他称之为“自尊果汁”——枯竭时，他发现自己陷入了低谷，压倒性的羞耻感可能会令他甚至不想踏出家门。 +


`主` The desire *to fill up 填补；装满 on self-esteem* `谓` has driven many of Skidmore’s more grandiose behaviors — ① whether *it was making himself* the *de facto* 实际上存在的（不一定合法） leader of multiple social groups *where he referred to himself as* “the Emperor” and *punished those who angered him* /② or *forging (v.)形成，缔造 relationships* purely *for the sake of* boosting his self-esteem. +
对自尊的渴望, 驱使斯基德莫尔做出许多更宏伟的行为 —— 无论是让自己成为多个社会群体事实上的领导者，他称自己为“皇帝”并惩罚那些激怒他的人，还是建立关系纯粹是为了提升他的自尊心。 +

Skidmore *hasn’t always presented himself* in grandiose ways: when he was younger, he was much more *outwardly (ad.)表面上；外表上 sensitive and insecure*. +
斯基德莫尔并不总是以浮夸的方式展现自己：当他年轻时，他外表上更加敏感和缺乏安全感。 +

“I remember l**ooking in the mirror** and thinking about *how disgusting 令人反感的，令人恶心的；令人气愤的 I was* and **how much I hated myself**.” +
“我记得看着镜子，想着我是多么恶心，我多么讨厌自己。” +


Clinicians' evaluations 评价，评估, *as well as* studies in the wider population, *support the idea that* narcissists oscillate (v.)（情感或行为）摇摆，波动，变化; 波动；振荡 between these two states. +
临床医生的评估, 以及对更广泛人群的研究, 都支持自恋者在这两种状态之间摇摆的观点。 +

They found that whereas （用以比较或对比两个事实）然而，但是，尽管 vulnerability and grandiosity *do not generally coexist (v.) in the same moment* 片刻；瞬间, *people who are overall 一般来说；大致上；总体上 more grandiose* also undergo (v.) periods of vulnerability — whereas *those who are generally more vulnerable* don’t experience much grandiosity. +
他们发现，虽然脆弱和自大通常不会同时存在，但整体上比较自大的人, 也会经历脆弱时期，而那些通常比较脆弱的人, 则不会经历太多自大。 +
 +
*Some studies suggest that* the overlap *may depend on* the severity of the narcissism: vulnerability *may be more likely* (a.) to appear in highly grandiose individuals. +
一些研究表明，重叠可能取决于自恋的严重程度："脆弱性"可能更可能出现在"高度自大"的人身上。 +
 +

To Diana Diamond, a clinical psychologist at the City University of New York, *such findings suggest that* the mask model is too simple. +
对于纽约城市大学的临床心理学家戴安娜戴蒙德来说，这些发现表明"面具模型"过于简单。 +
“ +


The picture is much more complex — vulnerability and grandiosity exist (v.) *in dynamic relation to each other*, and they fluctuate (v.)（大小、数量、质量等）波动；（在…之间）起伏不定 according to *what the individual is encountering (v.) in life*, the stage of their own development.” +
情况要复杂得多——脆弱性和自大性, 彼此存在着动态关系，并且根据个人在生活中遇到的情况, 以及自身发展的阶段而波动。” +

Although *grandiose people* may sometimes feel (v.) vulnerable, that vulnerability *isn’t necessarily linked to* insecurities, Miller argues. +
米勒认为，虽然自大的人有时可能会感到脆弱，但这种脆弱并不一定与不安全感有关。 +

“I think *they feel really angry* because `主` *what they cherish (v.)珍爱；钟爱；爱护 more than anything* `系` is a sense of superiority 优越（性）；优势 and status — and *when that’s called into question* 怀疑；引起怀疑, they’re going to *lash 鞭打；抽打 back*,” +

These differences (n.) in perspective  态度；观点；思考方法 *may arise* because different types of psychologists are studying different populations. +
这些观点上的差异, 可能是因为不同类型的心理学家正在研究不同的人群。 +

In a 2017 study, researchers surveyed (v.) 23 *clinical psychologists* and 22 *social and/or personality psychologists* (who do not *work with patients*) and found that although both groups *viewed* grandiosity *as* an essential 完全必要的；必不可少的；极其重要的;本质的；基本的；根本的 aspect of narcissism, clinical psychologists *were slightly more likely* to *view* vulnerability *as* being at its core. +
在 2017 年的一项研究中，研究人员调查了 23 名临床心理学家和 22 名社会和/或人格心理学家（他们不与患者一起工作），发现虽然两组人都认为"自大"是自恋的一个重要方面，但临床心理学家更有可能认为"脆弱"作为其核心。 +


Most narcissists who seek help are generally more vulnerable, Miller notes: “These are wounded people who come in to seek treatment for their wounds.” To him, that means clinics might not be the best place to study narcissism—at least not its grandiose aspect. +
米勒指出，大多数寻求帮助的自恋者通常更容易受到伤害：“这些人是来寻求治疗的受伤者。”对他来说，这意味着诊所可能不是研究自恋的最佳场所——至少不是研究自恋的浮夸方面。 +

It’s “a little bit like trying to learn about a lion’s behavior in a zoo,” he says. +
他说，这“有点像试图了解动物园里狮子的行为”。 +


The unwillingness to seek therapy is especially true of “malignant narcissists,” who, in addition to the usual characteristics, exhibit antisocial and psychopathic features such as lying chronically or enjoying inflicting pain or suffering on others. +
不愿意寻求治疗的“恶性自恋者”尤其如此，除了通常的特征外，他们还表现出反社会和精神病态的特征，例如长期撒谎或享受给他人造成痛苦或折磨。 +
 +
Marianne (whose name has been changed for privacy) recalls her father, a brilliant scientist whom her own therapist deemed a malignant narcissist . +
玛丽安（出于隐私原因，化名）回忆起她的父亲，一位才华横溢的科学家，她自己的治疗师认为他是一个恶性自恋者。 +

(He never sought therapy.) +
（他从未寻求治疗。） +
 +
He implemented stringent rules. +
他执行了严格的规则。 +
“There was [hardly] a day without that kind of drama—one person being isolated, punished, humiliated, being called out.” +
“几乎没有一天没有这样的戏剧性事件——一个人被孤立、惩罚、羞辱、被点名。” +
 +
Her father also pitted her siblings and their mother against one another to prevent them from forging close connections—and he constantly looked for flaws in those around him. +
她的父亲还让她的兄弟姐妹和他们的母亲互相对抗，以阻止他们建立密切的联系——他不断地寻找周围人的缺点。 +
Marianne recalls dinner parties at home where her father spent hours trying to pinpoint weaknesses among the other husbands and to hurt couples' opinions of each other. +
玛丽安回忆起在家里举行的晚宴上，她的父亲花了几个小时试图找出其他丈夫的弱点，并破坏夫妻之间对彼此的看法。 +
When Marianne brought home boyfriends, her father challenged them and tried to prove that he was superior. +
当玛丽安带男朋友回家时，她的父亲向他们提出挑战，并试图证明自己更优秀。 +
And despite being a dazzling academic who easily charmed people when they first met, he got fired time and time again because of conflicts at the universities where he worked. +
尽管他是一位耀眼的学者，一见面就很容易被人迷住，但他却一次又一次因为所在大学的冲突而被解雇。 +
“It was all about one-upmanship,” she says. +
“一切都是为了比人更胜一筹，”她说。 +
“His impulse to destroy anything that was shiny, that was popular, that was loved—it overwhelmed everything else.” +
“他想要摧毁任何闪亮的、流行的、受人喜爱的东西的冲动——它压倒了其他一切。” +
 +
Malignant narcissists often pose the greatest challenge for therapists—and they may be particularly dangerous in leadership positions, Diamond notes. +
戴蒙德指出，恶性自恋者常常给治疗师带来最大的挑战，他们在领导职位上可能尤其危险。 +
They can have deficient moral functioning while exerting an enormous amount of influence on followers. +
他们的道德功能可能存在缺陷，同时对追随者施加巨大影响。 +
“I think this is something that’s going on right now, with the rise of authoritarianism worldwide,” she adds. +
“我认为随着威权主义在全球范围内的兴起，这就是现在正在发生的事情，”她补充道。 +
 +
AN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD?  不幸的童年？ +
 +
Research with identical and nonidentical twins suggests that narcissism may be at least partially genetically heritable, but other studies indicate that dysfunctional parenting might also play a significant role. +
对同卵和异卵双胞胎的研究表明，自恋可能至少部分是遗传性的，但其他研究表明，功能失调的养育方式也可能发挥重要作用。 +
Grandiosity may derive from caregivers holding inflated views about their child’s superiority, whereas vulnerability may originate in having a caregiver who was cold, neglectful, abusive or invalidating. +
夸大可能源于照顾者对孩子的优越性抱有夸大的看法，而脆弱性可能源于照顾者冷漠、疏忽、虐待或虚弱。 +
Complicating matters, some studies find overvaluation also plays a role in vulnerable narcissism, whereas others fail to find a link between parenting and grandiosity. +

== What Is Narcissism? Science Confronts a Widely Misunderstood Phenomenon

But chances are you've encountered a narcissist, and they looked nothing like Trump, Musk or Modi. Up to 6 percent of the U.S. population, mostly men, is estimated to have had narcissistic personality disorder during some period of their lives. And the condition manifests in confoundingly different ways. People with narcissism “may be grandiose or self-loathing, extraverted or socially isolated, captains of industry or unable to maintain steady employment, model citizens or prone to antisocial activities,” according to a review paper on diagnosing the disorder.



Clinicians note several dimensions on which narcissists vary. They may function extremely well, with successful careers and vibrant social lives, or very poorly. They may (or may not) have other disorders, ranging from depression to sociopathy. And although most people are familiar with the “grandiose” version of narcissism—as displayed by an arrogant and pompous person who craves attention—the disorder also comes in a “vulnerable” or “covert” form, where individuals suffer from internal distress and fluctuations in self-esteem. What these seeming opposites have in common is an extreme preoccupation with themselves.


Most psychologists who treat patients say that grandiosity and vulnerability coexist in the same individual, showing up in different situations. Among academic psychologists, however, many contend that these two traits do not always overlap. This debate has raged for decades without resolution, most likely because of a conundrum: vulnerability is almost always present in a therapist's office, but individuals high in grandiosity are unlikely to show up for treatment. Psychologist Mary Trump deduces, from family history and close observation, that her uncle, Donald Trump, meets the criteria for narcissistic as well as, probably, antisocial personality disorder, at the extreme end of which is sociopathy. But “coming up with an accurate and comprehensive diagnosis would require a full battery of psychological and neuropsychological tests that he'll never sit for,” she notes in her book on the former president.


Now brain science is contributing to a better understanding of narcissism. It's unlikely to resolve the debate, but preliminary studies are coming down on the side of the clinicians: vulnerability indeed seems to be the hidden underside of grandiosity.


Tessa has sometimes felt on top of the world.  “I thought I could just keep perfecting myself and that someday I would end up as this amazing person surrounded by this amazing life.” But she also hit severe emotional lows. One came when she realized that the fabulous life she imagined might never come to be. “It was one of the longest periods of depression I've ever gone through.”

“Sometimes I simultaneously feel above everything, above life itself, and also like a piece of trash on the side of the road.” Tessa was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) in 2023.



What makes narcissism particularly complex is that it may not always be dysfunctional. +


The relatively functional variety of narcissism includes having, when things are going well, a positive view of oneself and a drive to preserve one's own well-being, while still being able to maintain close relationships with others and tolerate divergences from an idealized version of oneself. Then there is “pathological” narcissism, characterized by an inability to maintain a steady sense of self-esteem. Those with this condition protect an inflated view of themselves at the expense of others and—when that view is threatened—experience anger, shame, envy and other negative emotions. They can go about living relatively normal lives and act out only in certain situations. Narcissistic personality disorder is a subtype of pathological narcissism in which someone has persistent, long-term issues. It often occurs along with other conditions, such as depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality or antisocial personality disorder.




In the 1960s and 1970s psychoanalysts Heinz Kohut and Otto Kernberg sketched what's now known as the “mask model” of narcissism. It postulated that grandiose traits such as arrogance and assertiveness conceal feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem. The 1980 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the main reference used by clinicians in the U.S., reflected this insight by including vulnerable features in its definition of NPD, although it emphasized the grandiose ones. But some psychiatrists contended that the vulnerability criteria overlapped too much with those of other personality disorders. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), in particular, shares with NPD characteristics of vulnerability such as difficulty managing emotions, sensitivity to criticism, and unstable relationships. Subsequent versions of the DSM therefore placed even more weight on grandiose features—such as an exaggerated sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success and power, an excessive need for admiration and a lack of empathy.


this focus on grandiosity did not accurately represent what he was seeing in narcissistic patients. It was completely ignoring what typically drives patients to come to therapy, which is vulnerability and distress.


enormous variability in how mental health practitioners were conceptualizing NPD, with dozens of labels for the ways in which narcissism expressed itself. But there was also a common thread: descriptions of both grandiose and vulnerable ways in which the disorder showed up.


researchers have found that both dimensions of narcissism are linked to what psychologists call “antagonism,” which includes selfishness, deceitfulness and callousness. But grandiosity is associated with being assertive and attention seeking, whereas vulnerability tends to involve neuroticism and suffering from anxiety, depression and self-consciousness. Vulnerable narcissism also more often goes along with self-harm (which can include hairpulling, cutting, burning and related behaviors that are also found in people with BPD) and risk of suicide than the grandiose form.


The two manifestations of narcissism are also linked to different kinds of problems in relationships. In grandiose states, people with NPD may be more vindictive and domineering toward others, whereas in vulnerable phases they may be more withdrawn and exploitable.



Jacob Skidmore, a 23-year-old with NPD, says he often flips from feeling grandiose to vulnerable, sometimes multiple times a day. If he's getting positive attention from others or achieves his goals, he experiences grandiose “highs” when he feels confident and secure.

But when these sources of ego boosts—something he refers to as “self-esteem juice” — dry up, he finds himself slipping into lows when an overwhelming feeling of shame might stop him from even leaving his home.



The desire to fill up on self-esteem has driven many of Skidmore's more grandiose behaviors—whether it was making himself the de facto leader of multiple social groups where he referred to himself as “the Emperor” and punished those who angered him or forging relationships purely for the sake of boosting his self-esteem. Skidmore hasn't always presented himself in grandiose ways: when he was younger, he was much more outwardly sensitive and insecure. “I remember looking in the mirror and thinking about how disgusting I was and how much I hated myself.”



Clinicians' evaluations, as well as studies in the wider population, support the idea that narcissists oscillate between these two states.


They found that whereas vulnerability and grandiosity do not generally coexist in the same moment, people who are overall more grandiose also undergo periods of vulnerability—whereas those who are generally more vulnerable don't experience much grandiosity.

Some studies suggest that the overlap may depend on the severity of the narcissism:  vulnerability may be more likely to appear in highly grandiose individuals.


To Diana Diamond, a clinical psychologist at the City University of New York, such findings suggest that the mask model is too simple. “

The picture is much more complex—vulnerability and grandiosity exist in dynamic relation to each other, and they fluctuate according to what the individual is encountering in life, the stage of their own development.”



Although grandiose people may sometimes feel vulnerable, that vulnerability isn't necessarily linked to insecurities, Miller argues. “I think they feel really angry because what they cherish more than anything is a sense of superiority and status—and when that's called into question, they're going to lash back,”



These differences in perspective may arise because different types of psychologists are studying different populations. In a 2017 study, researchers surveyed 23 clinical psychologists and 22 social and/or personality psychologists (who do not work with patients) and found that although both groups viewed grandiosity as an essential aspect of narcissism, clinical psychologists were slightly more likely to view vulnerability as being at its core.


Most narcissists who seek help are generally more vulnerable, Miller notes: “These are wounded people who come in to seek treatment for their wounds.” To him, that means clinics might not be the best place to study narcissism—at least not its grandiose aspect. It's “a little bit like trying to learn about a lion's behavior in a zoo,” he says.


The unwillingness to seek therapy is especially true of “malignant narcissists,” who, in addition to the usual characteristics, exhibit antisocial and psychopathic features such as lying chronically or enjoying inflicting pain or suffering on others.


Marianne (whose name has been changed for privacy) recalls her father, a brilliant scientist whom her own therapist deemed a malignant narcissist . (He never sought therapy.)

He implemented stringent rules.  “There was [hardly] a day without that kind of drama—one person being isolated, punished, humiliated, being called out.”


Her father also pitted her siblings and their mother against one another to prevent them from forging close connections—and he constantly looked for flaws in those around him. Marianne recalls dinner parties at home where her father spent hours trying to pinpoint weaknesses among the other husbands and to hurt couples' opinions of each other. When Marianne brought home boyfriends, her father challenged them and tried to prove that he was superior. And despite being a dazzling academic who easily charmed people when they first met, he got fired time and time again because of conflicts at the universities where he worked. “It was all about one-upmanship,” she says. “His impulse to destroy anything that was shiny, that was popular, that was loved—it overwhelmed everything else.”


Malignant narcissists often pose the greatest challenge for therapists—and they may be particularly dangerous in leadership positions, Diamond notes. They can have deficient moral functioning while exerting an enormous amount of influence on followers. “I think this is something that's going on right now, with the rise of authoritarianism worldwide,” she adds.




AN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD?  +


Research with identical and nonidentical twins suggests that narcissism may be at least partially genetically heritable, but other studies indicate that dysfunctional parenting might also play a significant role. Grandiosity may derive from caregivers holding inflated views about their child's superiority, whereas vulnerability may originate in having a caregiver who was cold, neglectful, abusive or invalidating. Complicating matters, some studies find overvaluation also plays a role in vulnerable narcissism, whereas others fail to find a link between parenting and grandiosity. “Children who develop NPD may have felt seen and appreciated when they achieved or behaved in a certain way that satisfied a caregiver's expectations but ignored, dismissed or scolded when they failed to do so,” Ronningstam summarizes in her guide to the disorder.


Skidmore attributes his own NPD to both genes and painful childhood experiences. “I've never met a narcissist who has not had trauma,” he says. “People just use love as this carrot on a stick [that] they hang above your head, and they tell you to behave or they'll take it away. And so I have this mindset of, ‘Well then, screw it! I don't need love. I can take admiration, achievements, my intelligence—you can't take those things away from me.’


Many researchers nonetheless say a lot more work is needed to determine what role, if any, parenting plays. Miller points out that most research to date of grandiosity, in particular, has found small effects. Further, the work was done retrospectively—asking people to recall their past experiences—rather than prospectively to see how early life experiences affect outcomes.


There is another way to study what is going on with a narcissist, however: look inside. In a study published in 2015, researchers at the University of Michigan recruited 43 boys aged 16 or 17 and asked them to fill out the Narcissism Personality Inventory, a questionnaire that primarily measures grandiose traits. The teenagers then played Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game, while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a noninvasive neuroimaging method that enables researchers to observe the brain at work.


Cyberball tests how well people deal with social exclusion. Participants are told that they're playing with two other people, although they are actually playing with a computer. In some rounds, the virtual players include the human participant; in others, the virtual players begin by tossing the ball to everyone but later pass it just between themselves—cutting the participant out of the game.


The teenagers with higher levels of grandiose narcissism turned out to have greater activity in the so-called social pain network than those with lower scores. This network is a collection of brain regions—including parts of the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex—that prior studies had found were associated with distress in the face of social exclusion. Interestingly, the researchers did not find differences in the boys' self-reports of distress. In another revealing fMRI study, Jauk and his Graz colleagues found that men (but not women) with higher levels of grandiose narcissism showed more activity in parts of the anterior cingulate cortex associated with negative emotions and social pain when viewing images of themselves compared with images of close friends or strangers.

The neuroscience of narcissism “is incredibly interesting, but at the same time, I'm very hesitant to interpret any of these results,” says Mitja Back, a psychologist at the University of Münster in Germany.



TOWARD TREATMENTS

To date, there have been no randomized clinical trials for treatments specific for narcissistic personality disorder. Clinicians have, however, begun to adapt psychotherapies that have proved to be effective in other related conditions, such as borderline personality disorder. Treatments currently used include “mentalization,” which aims to help individuals make sense of both their own and others' mental states, and “transference,” which focuses on enhancing a person's ability to self-reflect, take the perspective of others and regulate their emotions. But there is still a dire need for effective treatments.
