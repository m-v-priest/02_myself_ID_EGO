== Leaving Pet Poop on the Sidewalk Isn’t Only Bad Manners—It’s Hazardous 将宠物粪便留在人行道上不仅是不礼貌的行为，而且很危险


As a small-animal primary care veterinarian, I deal with the diseases of dog and cat poop on a daily basis. Feces represent potential zoonotic hazards, meaning they can transmit disease from the animals to people.

[.my2]
作为一名小动物初级保健兽医，我每天都处理狗和猫粪便的疾病。粪便代表了潜在的人畜共患病危害，这意味着它们可以将疾病从动物传播给人类。


The reality is that waste left to wash into the soil, whether in a neighborhood, trail or dog park, can spread life-threateningparasites not just among dogs and cats, but also to wild animals and people of all ages. A 2020 study found intestinal parasites in 85% of off-leash dog parks across the United States.

[.my2]
现实情况是，无论是在社区、步道还是狗公园，*被冲入土壤的废物, 不仅会在狗和猫之间传播危及生命的寄生虫，还会在野生动物和各个年龄段的人之间传播。* 2020 年的一项研究发现，美国 85% 的不拴绳遛狗公园, 都存在肠道寄生虫。

Common dog poop parasites include hookworms, roundworms, coccidia and whipworms. Hookworms and roundworms can thrive in a variety of species, including humans.

废弃粪便对人类的影响

Common dog poop parasites include hookworms, roundworms, coccidia and whipworms. Hookworms and roundworms can thrive in a variety of species, including humans.

[.my2]
常见的狗粪便中的寄生虫包括: 钩虫、蛔虫、球虫和鞭虫。*钩虫和蛔虫可以在包括人类在内的多种物种中, 繁衍生息。*


Their microscopic larvae can get into your body through small scratches in your skin after contact with contaminated soil or via accidental oral ingestion. Remember that next time you’re outside and wipe sweat from your face with a dirty hand and then lick your lips or take a drink – it’s that simple. After hose or rain water has rinsed contaminated poop into the soil, these parasite eggs can survive and infect for months or years to come.

[.my2]
**它们的微小幼虫, 可以在接触受污染的土壤后, 通过皮肤上的小划痕或意外口服, 进入您的体内。**请记住，下次您外出时，用脏手擦去脸上的汗水，然后舔嘴唇或喝一杯水 - 就这么简单。*在软管或雨水将受污染的粪便冲入土壤后，这些寄生虫卵可以存活并感染数月或数年。*

Once in the human body, both hookworm and roundworm larvae can mature and migrate through the bloodstream into the lungs. From there, coughs help them gain access to the digestive tract of their host, where they leach nutrients by attaching to the intestinal wall. People with healthy immune systems may show no clinical signs of infection, but in sufficient quantities these parasites can lead to anemia and malnourishment. They can even cause an intestinal obstruction which may require surgical intervention, especially in young children.

[.my2]
**一旦进入人体，钩虫和蛔虫幼虫, 都会成熟, 并通过血流迁移到肺部。从那里，咳嗽帮助它们进入宿主的消化道，在那里它们通过附着在肠壁上吸收营养。免疫系统健康的人, 可能不会表现出感染的临床症状，但这些寄生虫数量足够多时, 可能会导致贫血和营养不良。它们甚至可能导致肠梗阻，**可能需要手术干预，尤其是对于幼儿。

Additionally, larval stages of roundworms can move into the human eye and, in rare cases, lead to permanent blindness. Hookworms can create a severely itchy condition called cutaneous larva migransas the larval worm moves just under the skin of its host.

[.my2]
此外，*蛔虫的幼虫阶段可以进入人眼，在极少数情况下，会导致永久性失明。当钩虫幼虫在宿主皮肤下移动时，会引起严重瘙痒，称为"皮肤幼虫移行症"。*

Once the parasite’s life cycle is complete, it may exit the host’s body as an intact adult worm, which looks like a small piece of cooked spaghetti.

[.my2]
**一旦寄生虫的生命周期完成，它可能会以完整的成虫形式离开宿主的身体，**看起来就像一小块煮熟的意大利面条。



==== THE IMPACT ON OTHER ANIMALS

[.my2]
对其他动物的影响


Dogs and cats can also develop the same symptoms people do due to parasitic infections. In addition to risks of hookworms and roundworms, pets are also vulnerable to whipworm, giardia and coccidia.

[.my2]
狗和猫也可能因寄生虫感染, 而出现与人类相同的症状。除了钩虫和蛔虫的风险外，宠物还容易感染鞭虫、贾第鞭毛虫和球虫。


Beyond parasites, unattended poop may also be contaminated with canine or feline viruses, such as parvovirus, distemper virus and canine coronavirus, that can create life-threatening disease in other dogs and cats, especially in adult animals that are unvaccinated and puppies and kittens.

[.my2]
除了寄生虫之外，**无人看管的粪便, 还可能被犬或猫病毒污染，**例如细小病毒、犬瘟热病毒, 和犬冠状病毒，**这些病毒可能会给其他狗和猫带来危及生命的疾病，**特别是在未接种疫苗的成年动物以及小狗和小猫中。

These virusesattack rapidly dividing cells, in particular the intestinal lining and bone marrow, leaving them unable to absorb nutrients appropriately and unable to produce replacement red and white blood cells that help defend against these and other viruses. Vaccination can protect pets.

[.my2]
**这些病毒攻击快速分裂的细胞，特别是肠道内壁和骨髓，使它们无法适当吸收营养，也无法产生替代的红细胞和白细胞, 来帮助防御这些病毒和其他病毒。**疫苗接种可以保护宠物。

Many species of local wildlife are within the canid and felid family groups. They, too, are susceptible to many of the same parasites and viruses as pet dogs and cats – while being much less likely to have received the benefit of vaccinations. Coyotes, wolves, foxes, raccoons, minks and bobcats are at risk of contracting parvovirus, coronavirus and distemper.

[.my2]
**许多当地野生动物, 属于犬科动物和猫科动物。它们也像宠物狗和猫一样, 容易受到许多相同的寄生虫和病毒的影响，但接种疫苗的可能性却要小得多。**土狼、狼、狐狸、浣熊、水貂和山猫, 有感染细小病毒、冠状病毒和犬瘟热的风险。


==== RESPONSIBLE PET POOP MANAGEMENT

[.my2]
负责任的宠物粪便管理


So, wherever your dog or cat relieves himself – at the park, in the woods, on the sidewalk, or even in your yard – pick up that poop but always avoid contact with your skin. It’s safest to use a shovel to place the poop directly into a plastic bag, or put a baggie over your hand to grab the poop and then pull the plastic bag over it. While it’s tempting to leave the “soft-serve” or watery poops behind, these are often the more likely culprits for spreading diseases.

[.my2]
因此，无论您的狗或猫在哪里大小便——在公园、在树林、在人行道上，甚至在您的院子里——都要**捡起粪便，但始终避免接触您的皮肤。最安全的方法是用铲子将粪便直接放入塑料袋中，或者将一个袋子放在手上以抓住粪便，然后将塑料袋套在上面。** 虽然人们很想把**“软便”或水样便便**抛在脑后，但这些**往往更可能是传播疾病的罪魁祸首。**


Tie up the bag and make sure to place it in a trash can – not on top – to avoid inadvertent contamination of a neighbor or sanitation worker. Promptly wash your hands, particularly before touching your face or eating or drinking. Hand sanitizers can take care of many viruses on your skin, but they won’t kill parasite eggs.

[.my2]
*扎紧袋子, 并确保将其放入垃圾桶中（而不是放在上面），以避免无意中污染邻居或环卫工人。立即洗手，尤其是在触摸脸部或进食或饮水之前。洗手液可以杀死皮肤上的许多病毒，但不能杀死寄生虫卵。*

Other potential sources of poop – and parasite – exposure are the sandbox, beaches and park sand found under and around playgrounds. Sand is comfortable to lounge on, fun to construct into castles, and softens the impact if you fall off a play structure. But cats and other small mammals love to use it as a litter box since it’s easy to dig and absorbs moisture. Covering sandboxes when not in use and closely monitoring your environment at the beach and playground are key steps toward minimizing the risks of exposure for everyone.

[.my2]
**粪便和寄生虫暴露的其他潜在来源, 是**游乐场下方和周围的**沙箱、海滩和公园沙子。沙子躺在上面很舒服，**建造城堡很有趣，并且可以减轻从游乐设施上摔下来时的冲击力。**但猫和其他小型哺乳动物喜欢用它作为垃圾箱，**因为它很容易挖掘并吸收水分。不使用时覆盖沙箱, 并密切监测海滩和游乐场的环境, 是最大限度降低每个人暴露风险的关键步骤。

By keeping your pets on regular parasite prevention protocols, with annual testing for intestinal parasites and routine removal of fecal material from the environment, you can help to minimize the potential for these diseases among all the mammals in your environment – human, pet and wild.

[.my2]
通过让您的宠物定期预防寄生虫，**每年检测肠道寄生虫, 并定期清除环境中的粪便，**可以帮助您最大程度地减少环境中所有哺乳动物（人类、宠物和野生动物）感染这些疾病的可能性。

Key points to remember to avoid parasites and minimize the impact on your ecosystem:

[.my2]
避免寄生虫, 并尽量减少对生态系统的影响, 需要记住的要点：

- Pick waste up and safely throw it out regardless of where your pet poops. Sanitize your hands afterward.

[.my2]
无论您的宠物在哪里排便，都要捡起废物并安全地扔掉。*之后消毒双手。*

- Wash your hands before eating or touching your face while gardening or working in the yard.

[.my2]
*在园艺或在院子里干活时，吃饭或触摸脸部之前要洗手。*

- Avoid rinsing poop into the soil. Using rain or a garden hose only removes the visible mess, not the microscopic issues.

[.my2]
*避免将粪便冲入土壤中。使用雨水或花园软管只能消除表面可见的混乱，而不能消除微观问题。*

- Make sure sandboxes are covered when not in use.

[.my2]
*确保沙箱在不使用时被覆盖。*

- Keep your pets on monthly intestinal parasite deworming schedules.

[.my2]
让您的宠物每月进行肠道寄生虫驱虫计划。

- Have your vet test your pet’s poop annually for intestinal parasites.

[.my2]
*每年让兽医检查宠物的粪便是否有肠道寄生虫。*
