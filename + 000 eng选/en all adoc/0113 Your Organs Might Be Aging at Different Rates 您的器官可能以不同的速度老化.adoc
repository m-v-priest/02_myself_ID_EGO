== Your Organs Might Be Aging (v.) at Different Rates 您的器官可能以不同的速度老化

*It turns out that* your *chronological 按发生时间顺序排列的 age* really is just a number. What’s more important for *knowing disease risk* is *the biological age* of each of your organs


事实证明，你的实际年龄实际上只是一个数字。对于了解疾病风险, 更重要的是每个器官的生物学年龄

The new research, published on Wednesday in Nature, *identified* about `宾` *one in five* healthy adults *older than* 50 years old `宾补` *as* an “extreme ager” — a person with *at least* one organ *aging (v.) at a highly accelerated rate*, *compared with* a cohort （有共同特点或举止类同的）一群人，一批人 of their peers.

这项周三发表在《自然》杂志上的新研究发现，50 岁以上的健康成年人中，约有五分之一为“极端老年人”，即与同龄人相比，至少一个器官的衰老速度加快。六十分之一的成年人, 有两个或更多器官正在迅速老化。研究小组测量了与器官相关的蛋白质，包括大脑、心脏、免疫组织和肾脏。


the team *measured* the concentrations 浓度；含量 of thousands of proteins in a drop of blood *and found that* almost 900 of them — about 18 percent of the proteins measured — tended to be *specific (a.)特定的;特有的；独特的 to* a single organ.

When those proteins varied (v.) from *the expected 预料的；预期的 concentration* for a particular chronological age, that indicated *accelerated 使加速; 加速 aging* (v.) in the corresponding organ.

研究小组测量了一滴血液中数千种蛋白质的浓度，发现其中近 900 种蛋白质（约占测量蛋白质的 18%）往往是单个器官特有的。当这些蛋白质与特定年龄的预期浓度不同时，表明相应器官的衰老加速。


“We could say *with reasonable 合理的；有理由的 certainty* that [a particular protein] likely *comes from the brain* and somehow *ends up in the blood*,” explains Tony Wyss-Coray, a professor of neurology at Stanford University and co-author of the new study.

If that *protein concentration* changes (v.) in the blood, “it must also likely change (v.) in the brain — and [that] tells us something about how the brain ages,” Wyss-Coray says.

斯坦福大学神经学教授、这项新研究的合著者托尼·怀斯-科雷 (Tony Wyss-Coray) 解释说：“我们可以合理肯定地说，[一种特定的蛋白质]可能来自大脑，并以某种方式最终进入血液。”如果血液中的蛋白质浓度发生变化，“大脑中的蛋白质浓度也可能会发生变化，这会告诉我们有关大脑如何老化的信息，”怀斯-科雷说。

By *comparing study*(v.) 比较研究,对照研究 participants’ organ-specific proteins, the researchers were able to estimate （对数量、成本等的）估计；估价 an age gap — the difference *between* an organ’s biological age *and* its chronological age.

Extreme aging in the kidneys was a strong predictor of hypertension and diabetes.

通过比较研究 “参与者的器官特异性蛋白质”，研究人员能够估计年龄差距，即器官的生物学年龄, 与其实际年龄之间的差异。根据所涉及的器官，研究发现，至少有一个器官加速衰老的参与者, 在未来 15 年内, 患病和死亡的风险会增加。例如，那些心脏比平时“老化”的人，其心力衰竭的风险, 是心脏典型老化的人的两倍多。心脏老化, 也是心脏病发作的一个强有力的预测因素。同样，那些大脑快速老化的人, 更有可能出现认知能力下降。大脑和血管系统的加速衰老, 与血浆 pTau-181（目前该疾病的临床血液生物标志物）一样, 有力地预测了阿尔茨海默病的进展。肾脏的极度衰老, 是高血压和糖尿病的有力预测因素。

Paul Shiels, a professor of cellular gerontology 老年学 at the University of Glasgow, who was not *involved in* the new research, says the study *was well powered* with sizable 相当大的，颇大的 cohorts.

格拉斯哥大学细胞老年学教授保罗·希尔斯（Paul Shiels）并未参与这项新研究，但他表示，这项研究的样本量相当大，效果良好。但他说，所包括的人的年龄范围“有点窄”。 “它只关注老年人，并不能代表整个生命历程。”

== Your Organs Might Be Aging at Different Rates 您的器官可能以不同的速度老化

It turns out that your chronological age really is just a number. What’s more important for knowing disease risk is the biological age of each of your organs

The number of birthdays you’ve had—better known as your chronological age—now appears to be less important in assessing your health than ever before. A new study shows that bodily organs get “older” at extraordinarily different rates, and each one’s biological age can be at odds with a person’s age on paper.



The new research, published on Wednesday in Nature, identified about one in five healthy adults older than 50 years old as an “extreme ager”—a person with at least one organ aging at a highly accelerated rate, compared with a cohort of their peers. One in 60 adults had two or more organs that were aging rapidly. The study team measured proteins related to organs, including the brain, heart, immune tissue and kidneys.


the team measured the concentrations of thousands of proteins in a drop of blood and found that almost 900 of them—about 18 percent of the proteins measured—tended to be specific to a single organ. When those proteins varied from the expected concentration for a particular chronological age, that indicated accelerated aging in the corresponding organ.


“We could say with reasonable certainty that [a particular protein] likely comes from the brain and somehow ends up in the blood,” explains Tony Wyss-Coray, a professor of neurology at Stanford University and co-author of the new study. If that protein concentration changes in the blood, “it must also likely change in the brain—and [that] tells us something about how the brain ages,” Wyss-Coray says.


By comparing study participants’ organ-specific proteins, the researchers were able to estimate an age gap—the difference between an organ’s biological age and its chronological age. Depending on the organ involved, participants found to have at least one with accelerated aging had an increased disease and mortality risk over the next 15 years. For example, those whose heart was “older” than usual had more than twice the risk of heart failure than people with a typically aging heart. Aging in the heart was also a strong predictor of heart attack. Similarly, those with a quickly aging brain were more likely to experience cognitive decline. Accelerated aging in the brain and vascular system predicted the progression of Alzheimer’s disease just as strongly as plasma pTau-181—the current clinical blood biomarker for the condition. Extreme aging in the kidneys was a strong predictor of hypertension and diabetes.


Paul Shiels, a professor of cellular gerontology at the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the new research, says the study was well powered with sizable cohorts. But the age range of the people included was “a little narrow,” he says. “It only looked at older individuals, and it wasn’t representative of a whole life course.”


The measurement of biological aging is an evolving science. “Epigenetic clocks,” a leading approach pioneered by Steve Horvath of the biotechnology research start-up Altos Labs, look at DNA changes to determine tissue age more accurately than other existing biological age estimators. When people age, the body begins to accumulate DNA signatures that can indicate how old a cell or organ is; this allows estimates of age. But epigenetic clocks estimate the age of the whole organism instead of an organ-specific age, Wyss-Coray says.


This research is part of the growing field of personalized diagnostics, which is based on the idea that several biological indicators of organ health can help clinicians target treatment. Blood measurements have traditionally been used to identify illness in the body, with clinicians making a diagnosis only after a person crosses the threshold of a certain set indicator. But as protein markers become more sensitive, “you can actually detect something abnormal before you have clinical manifestations,”




The momentum of commercial epigenetic testing is a “gold rush,” Shiels says. “There is a degree of oversell on what [the tests] can do.”


According to Wyss-Coray, each organ is fundamental to overall health. He likens the human body to a car: “If one part doesn’t work well, the other parts start to suffer,” he says. “If you maintain certain parts, you can prolong the life span of the car.”
