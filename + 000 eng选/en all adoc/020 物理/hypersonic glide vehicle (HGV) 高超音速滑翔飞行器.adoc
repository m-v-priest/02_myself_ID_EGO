当时导弹发展面临的主要挑战, 是将武器升上天空。剩下的大部分工作, 都是由"地心引力"完成的。

直到 20 世纪 80 年代，第一批能够在下降过程中操纵方向的弹头，才出现。即使是它们，其活动范围也很有限，因此很容易预测它们落点的目标区域。

新一代的极超音速导弹, 正在改变这一切。其中一些可能能够以极快的速度横跨大陆，他们的目标直到撞击前几秒钟才能预测。

美国核武库的支柱，Minuteman III洲际弹道导弹（ICBM），其“圆概率误差”约为120米，意味着预计只有一半的导弹会着陆在距离目标点120米内。对于核弹来说这是可以接受的，但对于打击舰船或跑道来说则无济于事。

圆形公算误差（英文简称CEP），是弹道学中的一种测量武器系统精确度的项目。其定义是 以目标为圆心划一个圆圈。如果武器命中此圆圈的机率最少有一半，则此圆圈的半径就是"圆形公算误差"。举例来说，美军三叉戟二型导弹的圆形公算误差是90米，则一枚此型导弹有50%的机率会落在目标90米以内。

有两种基本设计:巡航导弹和滑翔机。高超音速巡航导弹,本质上是现有导弹的更快版本. 滑翔机...但与老式的抛射不同的是，它们在天空中, 并不遵循可预测的抛物线轨迹飞行。相反，高超音速滑翔飞行器(HGV), 在火箭仍在上升时, 就与火箭分离，要么沿着大气层上层进行跳跃，要么重新进入大气层, 并在大气层中滑行数百或数千公里。

这样的滑翔机有几个优点。弹道导弹不太灵活，而且往往不太精确。美国核武库的支柱—​民兵III型洲际弹道导弹的“圆形误差可能”约为120米，这意味着预计只有一半发射的导弹, 能落在落点120米以内。这对核弹来说很好，但对于想要击中船只或跑道来说, 就没什么用了。另一方面，今天的巡航导弹非常精确 — 它可以通过窗口发射, 但速度要慢得多。

== <pure> Gliding missiles that fly faster than Mach 5 are coming

...early missile development, whose principal challenge was hoisting the weapons into the sky. Gravity did most of the rest.  The first warheads capable of steering on descent  did not arrive until the 1980s. Even they were limited in how much they could move around, making it pretty easy to predict their target area.

A new generation of hypersonic missiles is changing all that. Some might be capable of gliding across continents at great speed, their target unpredictable until seconds before impact.




There are two basic designs: cruise missiles and gliders.

Hypersonic cruise missiles are essentially  faster versions of existing ones but powered by very different jet engines.

Gliders ... But unlike the old-fashioned projectiles, they do not follow a predictable, parabolic arc through the sky.

Instead, a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV)  detache from the rocket while it is still ascending  and either skips along the upper atmosphere or, having re-entered, glides through it for hundreds or thousands of kilometres.

Such gliders have several advantages.

Ballistic missiles are less agile and tend not to be very accurate.  A Minuteman  III ICBM, the backbone  of America’s nuclear arsenal  has a “circular error probable”  of roughly 120m, meaning only half the missiles fired are expected to land within 120m of the impact point. That is fine for nuclear bombs but useless for hitting a ship or runway.

Today’s cruise missiles, on the other hand, are very accurate — one could be sent through a window — but much slower.
