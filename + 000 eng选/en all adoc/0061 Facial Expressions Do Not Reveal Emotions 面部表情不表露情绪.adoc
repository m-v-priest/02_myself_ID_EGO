== Facial Expressions Do Not Reveal Emotions 面部表情不表露情绪


Do your facial movements broadcast (v.)散布，传播（信息等） your emotions to other people? If you think the answer is yes, think again. This question is under contentious 有争议的,可能引起争论的 debate. Some experts maintain (v.) that /people around the world make specific, recognizable faces /that express certain emotions, such as smiling in happiness, scowling 怒视（某人或某物） in anger /and gasping 倒吸气 with widened eyes in fear.

你的面部动作会向其他人传达你的情绪吗？如果您认为答案是肯定的，请再考虑一下。这个问题正在进行有争议的辩论。一些专家认为，世界各地的人都会制作特定的、可识别的面孔来表达特定的情绪，例如高兴时微笑、愤怒时皱眉和恐惧时睁大眼睛喘气。他们指出数百项研究似乎表明微笑、皱眉等是普遍的情绪面部表情。他们还经常引用查尔斯·达尔文 (Charles Darwin) 1872 年的著作《人与动物的情感表达》(The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals) 来支持普遍表达方式是由自然选择进化而来的说法。

其他科学家指出大量反证，表明情绪期间的面部动作差异太大，无法成为情绪意义的普遍标志。人们在密谋打倒敌人时​​可能会仇恨地微笑，而在听到糟糕的双关语时会高兴地皱起眉头。在美拉尼西亚文化中，睁大眼睛喘着粗气的脸是侵略的象征，而不是恐惧。这些专家表示，所谓的普遍表达方式只是代表了文化刻板印象。需要明确的是，辩论双方都承认面部动作因特定情绪而异。分歧在于是否有足够的一致性来检测某人的感受。

这场辩论不仅仅是学术性的；结果会产生严重的后果。今天，你可能会被拒绝工作，因为所谓的情绪阅读系统会在镜头前观察你，应用人工智能来评估你在面试期间的面部动作。在美国法院，如果法官或陪审团认为被告的表情缺乏悔意，他们有时可能会判处更严厉的刑罚，甚至死刑。全国各地学前班的孩子们被教导从书籍、游戏和无实体面孔的海报中识别微笑是快乐，皱眉是愤怒和其他表达刻板印象。对于自闭症儿童，其中一些人难以感知他人的情绪，这些教导并不能转化为更好的沟通。

chatGpt的回答: 在这里，“have gas”指的是人们出现肠胃气体的情况。当人们消化过程中产生气体时，他们可能会出现腹部不适或胀气的情况。这种情况可能导致他们面部表情紧张，类似于愤怒时的皱眉，但实际上并不是由于愤怒引起的。




大量证据表明达尔文错了，而且他的错误是愚蠢的。在现实生活中，人们以巨大的可变性来表达给定的情绪。例如，根据测量"情绪时面部的运动"的研究的荟萃分析，城市文化中的人, 在愤怒时只有大约 35% 的时间会皱眉（或做出一些面部动作来表示皱眉）。皱眉也不是特定于愤怒，因为人们皱眉是出于其他原因，例如当他们集中注意力或当他们有气体时。同样巨大的变化发生在每一种被研究的情绪上——以及所有其他据称可以告诉我们某人情绪状态的指标，无论是他们的生理机能、声音还是大脑活动。

达尔文的《表情》（Expression）这本书认为，特定情绪（例如愤怒）的实例, 共享着一个独特、不可改变的物理原因或状态—— 一种"本质"(即 "原型, 模板")，使得即使它们有表面上的差异，这些实例仍然相似。科学家们提出了各种各样的本质概念，其中一些很容易被看到，比如面部动作，而其他的则需要专门的仪器才能观察到，比如心率、呼吸和体温等复杂交织的模式。这种"本质主义"的信仰在直觉上很有说服力。然而，它也是有害的，因为几乎不可能证明一个"本质"不存在。那些相信"本质"存在, 但尽管反复尝试却仍然无法观察到它们的人, 往往仍然相信它们。研究人员尤其倾向于通过表示工具和方法还不足以找到他们所寻求的本质来为自己的信念辩护。

这个困境的解决方案, 可以在达尔文更著名的《物种起源》（On the Origin of Species）一书中找到，该书比《表情》早13年写成。具有讽刺意味的是，根据著名的生物学家欧内斯特·梅尔（Ernst Mayr）的说法，《物种起源》帮助生物学“摆脱了'本质主义'的麻痹束缚”。在《物种起源》出版之前，学者们相信每个生物物种都有一个由上帝创造的"理想形态"，具有能够将其与所有其他物种区分开的定义性特征——"本质"。可以将其视为生物学的“狗展”版本。在狗展中，每个参赛者都被评判与一个理想的狗进行比较。与理想的狗偏离被认为是错误。**《物种起源》的革命性观点是，一个物种是一个多样化的个体群体，没有核心的本质。理想的狗并不存在，**它只是许多不同狗的统计摘要。*变异不是错误，它是自然选择的必要因素。然而，在情绪方面，达尔文却陷入了"本质主义"的陷阱，忽视了他最重要的发现。*

== Facial Expressions Do Not Reveal Emotions

Do your facial movements broadcast your emotions to other people? If you think the answer is yes, think again. This question is under contentious debate. Some experts maintain that people around the world make specific, recognizable faces that express certain emotions, such as smiling in happiness, scowling in anger and gasping with widened eyes in fear. They point to hundreds of studies that appear to demonstrate that smiles, frowns, and so on are universal facial expressions of emotion. They also often cite Charles Darwin’s 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals to support the claim that universal expressions evolved by natural selection.


Other scientists point to a mountain of counterevidence showing that facial movements during emotions vary too widely to be universal beacons of emotional meaning. People may smile in hatred when plotting their enemy’s downfall and scowl in delight when they hear a bad pun. In Melanesian culture, a wide-eyed gasping face is a symbol of aggression, not fear. These experts say the alleged universal expressions just represent cultural stereotypes. To be clear, both sides in the debate acknowledge that facial movements vary for a given emotion; the disagreement is about whether there is enough uniformity to detect what someone is feeling.

This debate is not just academic; the outcome has serious consequences. Today you can be turned down for a job because a so-called emotion-reading system watching you on camera applied artificial intelligence to evaluate your facial movements unfavorably during an interview. In a U.S. court of law, a judge or jury may sometimes hand down a harsher sentence, even death, if they think a defendant’s face showed a lack of remorse. Children in preschools across the country are taught to recognize smiles as happiness, scowls as anger and other expressive stereotypes from books, games and posters of disembodied faces. And for children on the autism spectrum, some of whom have difficulty perceiving emotion in others, these teachings do not translate to better communication.


A preponderance of evidence shows that Darwin was wrong, and his mistake was a doozy. In real life, people express a given emotion with tremendous variability. In anger, for example, people in urban cultures scowl (or make some of the facial movements for a scowl) only about 35 percent of the time, according to meta-analyses of studies measuring facial movement during emotion. Scowls are also not specific to anger because people scowl for other reasons, such as when they are concentrating or when they have gas. The same tremendous variation occurs for every emotion studied—and for every other measure that purportedly tells us about someone’s emotional state, whether it’s their physiology, voice or brain activity.

Emotion AI systems, therefore, do not detect emotions. ... there was no objective way to confirm what, if anything, the anonymous people in the videos were feeling in those moments.

There’s also considerable evidence that facial movements are just one signal of many in a much larger array of contextual information that our brain takes in. Show people a grimacing face in isolation, and they may perceive pain or frustration. But show the identical face on a runner crossing the finish line of a race, and the same grimace conveys triumph. The face is often a weaker signal of a person’s internal state than other signals in the array.

Darwin’s Expression suggests that instances of a particular emotion, such as anger, share a distinct, immutable, physical cause or state—an essence—that makes the instances similar even if they have superficial differences. Scientists have proposed a variety of essences, some of which are easily seen, such as facial movements, and others, such as complex, intertwined patterns of heart rate, breathing and body temperature, that are observed only with specialized instruments. This belief in essences, called essentialism, is compellingly intuitive. It’s also pernicious because it is virtually impossible to prove that an essence doesn’t exist. People who believe in essences but fail to observe them despite repeated attempts often continue to believe in them anyway. Researchers, in particular, tend to justify their belief by suggesting that tools and methods are not yet sufficient to locate the essences they seek.

A solution to this conundrum can be found in Darwin’s more famous book On the Origin of Species, written 13 years before Expression. Ironically, it is celebrated for helping biology “escape the paralyzing grip of essentialism,” according to heralded biologist Ernst Mayr. Before Origin was published, scholars believed that each biological species had an ideal form, created by God, with defining properties—essences—that distinguished it from all other species. Think of this as the “dog show” version of biology. In a dog show, each competitor is judged against a hypothetical ideal dog. Deviation from the ideal is considered error. Darwin’s Origin proposed, radically, that a species is a vast population of varied individuals with no essence at its core. The ideal dog doesn’t exist—it is a statistical summary of many diverse dogs. Variation is not error; it is a necessary ingredient for natural selection by the environment. When it came to emotions, however, Darwin fell prey to essentialism, ignoring his most important discovery.


Like a species, a given emotion such as fear, grief or elation is a vast population of varied instances. People may indeed widen their eyes and gasp in fear, but they may also scowl in fear, cry in fear, laugh in the face of fear and, in some cultures, even fall asleep in fear. There is no essence. Variation is the norm, and it is intimately linked to a person’s physiology and situation, just as variation in a species is linked to the environment its members live in.


An increasing number of emotion researchers are taking population thinking more seriously and moving beyond the essentialist ideas of the past. It is time for emotion AI proponents and the companies that make and market these products to cut the hype and acknowledge that facial muscle movements do not map universally to specific emotions. The evidence is clear that the same emotion can accompany different facial movements and that the same facial movements can have different (or no) emotional meaning. Variety, not uniformity, is the rule.

Darwin’s Expression is best viewed as a historical text, not a definitive scientific guide. That leads to a deeper lesson here: Science is not truth by authority. Science is the quantification of doubt by repeated observation in varied contexts. Even the most exceptional scientists can be wrong. Fortunately, mistakes are part of the scientific process. They are opportunities for discovery.
