你听说过铲雪会导致心脏病吗？这实际上是有一定道理的。 +

The *physical exertion* (n.)努力；尽力；费力 of shoveling is certainly a factor, but even people **who are used to yard work **can be vulnerable: when temperatures *hit (v.)达到（某水平） exceptionally （用于形容词和副词之前表示强调）罕见，特别，非常 frigid (a.)寒冷的；严寒的 lows*, the heart *can overwork (v.) itself* by trying to prevent the body from freezing to death — especially if *a preexisting 早已存在的，业已存在的 condition* is already *making the organ pump (v.) hard*. +
铲土的体力消耗当然是一个因素，但即使是习惯于在院子里工作的人, 也可能很脆弱:当气温降至异常寒冷的低点时，心脏可能会过度劳累，试图防止身体冻死 —— 特别是如果"先前存在的疾病"已经使器官泵血, 变得困难的话。 +

*A growing body 大量；大批；大堆 of research* is clarifying the link between environmental temperature and heart health. +
越来越多的研究, 正在阐明环境温度与心脏健康之间的联系。 +

What is *the sympathetic nervous system* (SNS)? +
什么是交感神经系统（SNS）？

Your *sympathetic nervous system* is part of your *autonomic  自主的; 不受意志支配的 nervous system*. It could be called your “automatic” nervous system, as it is responsible for many functions that you don’t have to think about to control. This can include control of your heart rate, blood pressure, digestion 消化, urination 撒尿，排尿 and sweating, among other functions. +
您的交感神经系统是自主神经系统的一部分。它可以被称为你的“自动”神经系统，因为它负责许多你不需要思考就能控制的功能。这包括控制心率、血压、消化、排尿和出汗等功能。

== Extreme Temperatures Can Threaten Heart Health

Have you ever heard that shoveling snow can cause a heart attack? There’s actually some truth to that. The physical exertion of shoveling is certainly a factor, but even people who are used to yard work can be vulnerable: when temperatures hit exceptionally frigid lows, the heart can overwork itself by trying to prevent the body from freezing to death—especially if a preexisting condition is already making the organ pump hard.

A growing body of research is clarifying the link between environmental temperature and heart health. And cold weather is not the only concern. Studies also show that outdoor heat of 108.9 degrees Fahrenheit triples the risk of cardiovascular death.

heat is becoming a more common threat to heart health.

The human body’s core temperature typically ranges from 97.5 to 98.9 degrees F. When intense cold starts to bring this temperature down, the body responds by activating the sympathetic nervous system (which is perhaps best known for setting off a person’s fight-or-flight response). This triggers certain mechanisms to preserve as much heat as possible. One such mechanism is vasoconstriction, which is when the muscles in blood vessel walls narrow to prevent heat loss.  Blood, an essential component of thermoregulation, normally distributes heat all over the body; in extreme cold, the sympathetic nervous system reduces blood flow to the skin to preserve warmth in the body.

Vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow keep a person warm, but they also increase blood pressure. Research presented at an American Heart Association conference earlier this year that has not yet been peer-reviewed showed that people were more likely to have increases in systolic pressure (a blood pressure measurement’s “top” reading, which represents the force pushing against the artery walls when the heart contracts) during winter, compared with summer. Elevated pressure forces the heart to work harder to circulate blood throughout the body.

This strain can increase one’s heart rate and blood pressure, which can result in cardiac symptoms for some people and can even result in heart attacks. lower temperatures may also raise the risk of blood clots. This is because blood thickens when cold, potentially causing platelets to stick together in a clot—which in turn increases the risk of heart attack or stroke.

HOW HEAT HARMS HEART HEALTH

Heat, as well as cold, can threaten core temperature regulation. In response to extreme heat, the sympathetic nervous system increases blood flow to the skin. This, along with vasodilation, or the widening of the blood vessels, helps excess heat dissipate. But on a hot day, getting more blood to the body’s surface makes the heart work overtime. The heart has to beat faster to circulate two to four times more blood per minute than it would in more comfortable weather.

Your heart has to work harder because it still needs to put blood into the rest of the body. In addition to that, it also needs to put more blood through the skin to help [the body] cool off.

If a person continues to feel overheated, Crandall says, their brain will keep on signaling the heart to beat faster—something that the heart cannot sustain indefinitely because a greater demand for blood flow means a greater need for oxygen. Thus, heat stress can overwork the heart muscle into an oxygen-starved state. That could cause some adverse events, particularly in individuals with various forms of heart disease. People with clogged arteries, for example, already have trouble supplying their heart with oxygen and other nutrients. The added strain could put them at risk of a heart attack.
