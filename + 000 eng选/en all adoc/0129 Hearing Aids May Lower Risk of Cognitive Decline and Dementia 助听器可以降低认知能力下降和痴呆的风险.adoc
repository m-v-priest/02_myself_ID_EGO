== Hearing Aids May Lower Risk of Cognitive Decline and Dementia 助听器可以降低认知能力下降和痴呆的风险

recent research has revealed that even mild or moderate hearing loss in older adults is associated with accelerated cognitive decline. +
最近的研究表明，即使老年人轻度或中度听力损失也与认知能力加速下降有关。 +

People with hearing loss are more likely to develop dementia, and the likelihood increases with the severity of the loss. +
听力损失的人更有可能患上痴呆症，而且这种可能性随着听力损失的严重程度而增加。 +

In 2020 a Lancet Commission on dementia identified hearing loss as the leading modifiable midlife risk factor for later development of the disease. +
2020 年，《柳叶刀》痴呆症委员会将听力损失确定为导致该疾病后期发展的主要可改变的中年风险因素。 +


In July, at the annual meeting of the Alzheimer’s Association, Frank Lin, an otolaryngologist and director of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, presented results from a first-of-its-kind randomized clinical trial of 977 adults between 70 and 84 with untreated hearing loss. +
7 月，在阿尔茨海默病协会年会上，耳鼻喉科医生、约翰·​​霍普金斯大学耳蜗听力与公共卫生中心主任 Frank Lin 介绍了一项针对 977 名成人的首个随机临床试验的结果70 至 84 岁之间，听力损失未得到治疗。 +

One group received best-practice hearing care, including aids, and another group took part in a program about successful aging. +
一组接受了最佳听力护理，包括辅助器具，另一组则参加了一个关于成功老龄化的项目。 +

Three years later hearing aids did not make much difference to the healthiest participants. +
三年后，助听器对最健康的参与者并没有产生太大影响。 +

But those who were at the higher risk for dementia because of age and underlying health conditions saw a 48 percent reduction in cognitive change if they got hearing aids. +
但那些因年龄和潜在健康状况而患痴呆症风险较高的人，如果佩戴助听器，认知能力变化会减少 48%。 +

When hearing loss is untreated, the brain’s organization changes. +
如果听力损失得不到治疗，大脑的组织就会发生变化。 +

In adults with mild hearing loss, studies show a decrease in gray matter. +
研究表明，在患有轻度听力损失的成年人中，灰质减少。 +

Hearing loss is also associated with more falls, higher health-care costs, and increased loneliness and social isolation. +
听力损失还与更多的跌倒、更高的医疗费用以及增加的孤独感和社会孤立感有关。 +

Hearing is fundamental to healthy aging. +
听力是健康老龄化的基础。

When hearing loss is untreated, the brain's organization changes. In adults with mild hearing loss, studies show a decrease in gray matter.

Hearing loss is also associated with more falls, higher health-care costs, and increased loneliness and social isolation. Hearing is fundamental to healthy aging.
