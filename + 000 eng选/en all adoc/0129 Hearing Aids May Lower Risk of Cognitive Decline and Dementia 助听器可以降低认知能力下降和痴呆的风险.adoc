== Hearing Aids May Lower Risk of Cognitive Decline and Dementia

recent research has revealed that even mild or moderate hearing loss in older adults is associated with accelerated cognitive decline. People with hearing loss are more likely to develop dementia, and the likelihood increases with the severity of the loss. In 2020 a Lancet Commission on dementia identified hearing loss as the leading modifiable midlife risk factor for later development of the disease.

In July, at the annual meeting of the Alzheimer's Association, Frank Lin, an otolaryngologist and director of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, presented results from a first-of-its-kind randomized clinical trial of 977 adults between 70 and 84 with untreated hearing loss. One group received best-practice hearing care, including aids, and another group took part in a program about successful aging. Three years later hearing aids did not make much difference to the healthiest participants. But those who were at the higher risk for dementia because of age and underlying health conditions saw a 48 percent reduction in cognitive change if they got hearing aids.

When hearing loss is untreated, the brain's organization changes. In adults with mild hearing loss, studies show a decrease in gray matter.

Hearing loss is also associated with more falls, higher health-care costs, and increased loneliness and social isolation. Hearing is fundamental to healthy aging.
