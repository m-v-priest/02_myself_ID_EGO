最近，一组科学家宣布了一种对抗高致病性"禽流感"（禽流感或禽流感）的突破性方法.
他们的方法使用了一种称为 CRISPR/Cas9 的基因编辑技术。一般来说，这种方法改变动物遗传密码的定义片段，以在功能上改变该代码的作用。在这个案例中，CRISPR被用来改变鸡的遗传密码，使鸡对禽流感有更强的抵抗力。虽然这是一项令人着迷的技术应用，但每当科学创新影响我们所吃的食物时，它就会成为一个敏感问题。除了对在我们的食品供应中使用 CRISPR 的哲学担忧之外，我们认为, *用 CRISPR 修饰的鸡对抗"禽流感", 会产生太多不可预测的结果，因此不能指望这项技术能够解决这种破坏性疾病。*

尽管 CRISPR 创造了几乎无限的机会来解决社会面临的一些与健康相关的挑战，包括最近针对人类镰状细胞病的疗法，但它不太可能成功控制禽流感。*所有禽流感病毒都起源于水禽，例如鸭子，它们是感染家禽种群的潜在新病毒的持续来源。禽流感病毒也很容易改变或突变其遗传物质，使病毒能够快速适应家禽以外的不同宿主。这种快速进化的能力, 也迅速改变了病毒的传播方式，使其难以控制，并且任何干预措施的影响, 都难以预见。*

最后，除了使用 CRISPR 改变鸡对"禽流感"的易感性的所有病毒学影响之外，我们还需要考虑人们如何看待食品供应中的这项技术。饲养家禽的公司, 不仅是畜牧业和福利方面的专家，而且也是营销和产品差异化方面的专家，有时会使用造成消费者困惑和误解的语言。例如，在美国，"给家禽或猪喂激素"是违法的，但公司却将其产品贴上“不添加激素”的标签，试图暗示其他公司可能也会这样做。我们可以想象一家公司宣传其“抗流感”鸡更环保，以影响消费者，而另一家公司可能会通过警告消费者"基因工程的危险"来做出回应，以造成他们的非基因工程鸡“更安全”的印象供人类消费。这种营销技术, 已经在其他转基因（或者现在被称为“生物工程”）农产品中使用，例如玉米、油菜、大豆和甜菜。

== CRISPR Will Likely Not Solve Bird Flu CRISPR


Recently, a group of scientists announced a breakthrough approach to combat Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (bird flu or avian flu).
Their approach uses a gene-editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9. In general, this method changes defined segments of an animal’s genetic code to functionally alter what that code does. In this case, CRISPR was used to alter chickens’ genetic code to make chickens more resistant to avian flu. While this was a fascinating use of the technology, any time scientific innovation affects the food we eat, it becomes a sensitive issue. On top of philosophical concerns regarding the use of CRISPR within our food supply, we think there are too many unpredictable outcomes related to combating avian influenza with CRISPR-modified chickens to expect this technology will be a solution to this destructive disease.


While CRISPR has created almost infinite opportunities to address some of the health-related challenges facing society, including recent therapies for sickle cell disease in humans, it’s not likely to be successful in controlling avian influenza. All avian influenza viruses originate in waterfowl, such as ducks, which serve as a constant source of potentially new viruses to infect poultry populations. Avian flu viruses also readily change—or mutate—their genetic material, allowing the viruses to quickly adapt to different hosts beyond poultry. This ability to quickly evolve also rapidly changes the way the virus spreads, making it challenging to control and the impact of any intervention difficult to foresee.


The 2022 virus has developed a different survival strategy by persisting in waterfowl populations for longer periods and over different life stages.
 the magnitude of these outbreaks would not have changed if there had been CRISPR-modified chickens on farms because the outbreaks were and are likely to still be driven by virus introductions from wild ducks.


This combination of genetic variability and the wide variety of birds and mammals that can be infected with avian flu will make it very difficult to predict the outcome of using CRISPR to increase the resistance of chickens to infection with avian flu. There is a real chance for unintended or unpredictable consequences. For example, as soon as the virus has trouble infecting CRISPR-modified chickens, it will change and adapt. While most changes won’t help the virus survive, there might be one among the billions of changes that will. Such a mutation could lead to a more deadly outbreak of avian flu in chickens, which could be catastrophic for this segment of our food supply. And it’s possible that one of the billions of changes that make it easier for the virus to survive in CRISPR-modified chickens could also make it more likely to be able to infect mammals including humans.



So, even though we understand a lot about influenza viruses, there’s even more we don’t understand.



Finally, in addition to all the virological implications of using CRISPR to alter chickens’ susceptibility to avian flu we need to consider how people might perceive this technology within the food supply. The companies that grow poultry are not only experts in animal husbandry and welfare but also in marketing and product differentiation, and sometimes use language that creates consumer confusion and misperception. For instance, in the U.S., it is illegal to feed hormones to poultry or pigs, yet companies label their products as being “no hormones added” in an attempt to suggest that other companies might be doing so. We can envision one company advertising their “influenza-resistant” chickens as more environmentally sustainable to sway consumers, while another company might respond by warning consumers of the dangers of genetic engineering to create the perception that their non–genetically engineered chickens are “safer” for human consumption. Such marketing techniques are already in use around other genetically modified (or, as they’re now labeled, “bioengineered”) agricultural products, such as corn, canola, soybeans and sugar beets.



We should use CRISPR to improve the environmental and economic sustainability of production, but any company or research group using genetic engineering techniques to modify the food we eat needs to be clear about the effects of these innovations to ensure public trust. We cannot create an opportunity for failure, or we will not have another chance.
