==  New Prostate Cancer Treatments Offer (v.) Hope for Advanced Cases 新的前列腺癌治疗, 为晚期病例带来希望



Deciding how to diagnose and treat prostate cancer has long been the subject of controversy and uncertainty. A prime example involves prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, a blood test for a telltale protein that can reveal cancer even when the patient has no symptoms. After its introduction in the early 1990s, PSA testing was widely adopted—millions of tests are done in the U.S. every year. In 2012, however, a government task force indicated that this test can lead to overtreatment of cancers that might have posed little danger to patients and so might have been best left alone.

确定如何诊断和治疗前列腺癌, 长期以来一直是争议和不确定性的主题。一个典型的例子是"前列腺特异性抗原"（PSA）测试，这是一种针对指示性蛋白质的血液测试，即使患者没有任何症状，也可以发现癌症。自 20 世纪 90 年代初推出以来，PSA 检测得到了广泛采用——美国每年进行数百万次检测。然而，2012 年，政府特别工作组表示，这项测试可能会导致对癌症的过度治疗，而这种治疗可能对患者几乎没有什么危险，因此最好不要进行干预。

While arguments for and against PSA testing continue to seesaw back and forth, the field has achieved a better grasp on what makes certain prostate cancers grow quickly, and those insights have paved the way for better patient prognoses at every stage of the disease, even for the most advanced cases. A prostate cancer specialist today has access to an enhanced tool set for treatment and can judge when measures can be safely deferred.

虽然支持和反对 PSA 检测的争论, 继续来回摇摆，但该领域已经更好地掌握了某些"前列腺癌"快速生长的原因，这些见解为在疾病的每个阶段更好地预测患者预后, 铺平了道路。最先进的案例。如今，前列腺癌专家可以使用增强的治疗工具集，并可以判断何时可以安全地推迟治疗。


Prostate cancer is still one of the most prevalent malignancies. Aside from some skin cancers, prostate cancers are the most common cancers among men in the U.S. Nearly 270,000 people in America will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and it is the fourth most common cancer worldwide. Fortunately, the vast majority of patients will live for years after being diagnosed and are more likely to die of causes unrelated to a prostate tumor.

**"前列腺癌"仍然是最常见的恶性肿瘤之一。除了一些"皮肤癌"之外，前列腺癌是美国男性中最常见的癌症。**今年美国将有近 27 万人被诊断出患有前列腺癌，*它是全球第四大常见癌症。幸运的是，绝大多数患者在被诊断后将存活数年，并且更有可能死于与前列腺肿瘤无关的原因。*


At its most basic level, prostate cancer is a malignancy that occurs in the prostate gland, which produces fluid that mixes with sperm from the testicles to make semen. The prostate is located in front of the rectum, below the bladder and above the penis, and cancer in the gland has four major stages.

从最基本的角度来看，*"前列腺癌"是一种发生在前列腺中的恶性肿瘤，前列腺产生的液体与睾丸中的精子混合, 形成精液。前列腺位于直肠前方、膀胱下方和阴茎上方，腺癌有四个主要阶段。*


Early on, localized tumors show no evidence of extension beyond the prostate gland. A second, “regionally advanced” form of the disease remains close to the prostate. Then there are metastatic prostate cancers, which spread outside the gland to other parts of the body. Treatment of tumors in this category has benefited from improved diagnostic imaging tests. In fact, with these tests, cancer specialists have characterized the fourth category, oligometastatic prostate cancer, a disease stage on a continuum between localized prostate cancer and more broadly dispersed metastatic disease. Major discoveries in the past 10 years have transformed the way we approach each type of prostate cancer, and these advances are likely to continue for decades to come.

**早期，局部肿瘤没有显示出扩展到前列腺以外的证据。**该疾病的第二种“区域晚期”形式仍然靠近前列腺。**然后是"转移性前列腺癌"，它们从腺体, 扩散到身体的其他部位。**此类肿瘤的治疗, 受益于诊断成像测试的改进。事实上，通过这些测试，癌症专家已经确定了**第四类，即"寡转移性前列腺癌"，这是介于"局限性前列腺癌"和"更广泛分散的转移性疾病"之间的连续统一体的疾病阶段。**过去十年的重大发现, 改变了我们治疗每种类型"前列腺癌"的方式，并且这些进展可能会在未来几十年持续下去。

The first treatment steps for people with localized cancer involve risk stratification. Through this process, a physician gauges the likelihood of a cancer’s being eliminated or cured by local treatment (usually surgery or radiation) and, if it does abate, of its returning. A physician determines the risk based on PSA results, physical examination of the prostate gland and inspection of cells from the biopsied tumor.

"局部癌症"患者的第一个治疗步骤, 涉及风险分层。通过这个过程，医生可以评估"癌症通过局部治疗（通常是手术或放射）被消除或治愈"的可能性，如果癌症确实减轻了，那么癌症复发的可能性也随之而来。医生根据 PSA 结果、前列腺体格检查, 和活检肿瘤细胞, 检查来确定风险。


The right course of action for a patient with elevated PSA levels continues to undergo constant revision. Until five to seven years ago, a physician evaluated a person with high PSA by feeling their prostate gland for potentially cancerous abnormalities. Invariably, the next step would be a needle biopsy—an uncomfortable procedure in which the physician obtains snippets of prostate tissue through the rectum.

[.my2]
对于 PSA 水平升高的患者，正确的治疗方案会持续不断地修改。直到五到七年前，一位医生通过"感觉前列腺是否存在潜在的癌变异常", 来评估 PSA 高的人。*下一步总是会进行"针刺活检"——这是一种不舒服的手术，医生通过直肠, 获取"前列腺组织"的碎片。*

But we now have a way to biopsy through the perineum—the area between the back of the scrotum and the anal-rectal area. Thanks to technical improvements, it can be done in an outpatient setting without general anesthesia or sedation. The technique reduces the patient’s risk of infection and need for antibiotics because it doesn’t disrupt the bacterial flora in the rectum. In a recent study, researchers compared outcomes in patients who underwent a trans­rectal biopsy and received antibiotics with those for people who had a transperineal biopsy with minimal to no antibiotics. They found the two approaches comparable in terms of complications from infections.

但我们现在, **有一种方法可以通过"会阴"（阴囊后部和肛门直肠区域之间的区域）进行活检。**由于技术的改进，它可以在门诊环境中完成，无需全身麻醉或镇静。该技术降低了患者感染的风险和对抗生素的需求，因为**它不会破坏直肠中的细菌菌群。**在最近的一项研究中，研究人员比较了接受经"直肠活检"并接受抗生素治疗的患者的结果, 与接受经"会阴活检"且仅使用极少抗生素或不使用抗生素的患者的结果。他们发现, 这两种方法在"感染并发症"方面具有可比性。

Even more exciting is the prospect of eliminating biopsies altogether. When a patient has an abnormal PSA value but their rectal examination shows no obvious evidence of cancerous deposits, physicians can now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the prostate and surrounding tissue. MRI scans are best for identifying clinically significant cancers—those that, if left untreated or undiagnosed, could eventually spread. MRI can also uncover more extensive cancer spread or tumors in unusual locations such as the front of the prostate.

[.my2]
更令人兴奋的, 是完全消除"活检"的前景。当患者 PSA 值异常, 但"直肠检查"未显示明显的癌沉积证据时，医生现在可以使用磁共振成像 (MRI) 来观察前列腺和周围组织。 MRI 扫描最适合识别具有临床意义的癌症，如果不及时治疗或诊断，这些癌症最终可能会扩散。 MRI 还可以发现更广泛的癌症扩散或异常位置（例如前列腺前部）的肿瘤。
