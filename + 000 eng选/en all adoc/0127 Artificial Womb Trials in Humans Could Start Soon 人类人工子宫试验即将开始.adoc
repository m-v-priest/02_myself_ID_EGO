胎盘内层是羊膜囊，羊膜囊包含羊水。**胎盘植入于子宫壁，并且从母体的血液获取营养与氧气，排出废物。这个介面也是一个障壁，拦下某些可能会伤害胚胎的物质。**但是很多物质是胎盘无法拦截的，像是酒精以及一些抽烟产生的物质。几种病毒也可以穿过胎盘，如德国麻疹。

胎盘还有新陈代谢跟内分泌活动。胎盘会分泌黄体激素，对维持怀孕很重要。也会分泌乳促素，增加母体的血糖与血脂，使得胎儿的营养摄取增加。

胎盘由以血管与结缔组织构成的脐带与胚胎相连。

== Artificial Womb Trials in Humans Could Start Soon


The team has emphasized that the technology is not intended — or able — to support development from conception to birth. Instead, the scientists hope that simulating some elements of a natural womb will increase survival and improve outcomes for extremely premature babies. In humans, that’s anything earlier than 28 weeks of gestation — less than 70% of the way to full term, which is typically between 37 and 40 weeks.

Preterm birth, defined by the World Health Organization as birth before 37 weeks of gestation, can happen spontaneously or because some conditions — such as an infection, hormone imbalance, high blood pressure or diabetes — can turn the womb into an inhospitable environment for the fetus.

It poses an enormous global health problem. Preterm birth is the largest cause of death and disability in children under five.

Mortality is strongly linked with the baby’s gestational age at birth. At or before 22 weeks — considered the cusp of fetal viability — few fetuses survive outside the womb. By 28 weeks, most can survive, but often require significant life support. Artificial-womb technology aims to improve outcomes for preterm babies who are born in the period between 22 and 28 weeks, for whom survival has improved, but long-term health issues are frequent.

In a study of 2.5 million people in Sweden, for example, 78% of people born before 28 weeks of gestation had some sort of medical condition — ranging from asthma and hypertension to cerebral palsy and epilepsy — by the time they were adults. For full-term births, that rate was 37%.

Death and disability, especially in babies born at younger gestational ages, often occur because the lungs and brain are among the last organs to fully mature in humans. That’s why obstetricians try to prevent preterm birth whenever possible — the longer fetuses can safely stay in the womb, the higher their odds are of long-term survival and good health.

In a natural womb, a fetus receives oxygen, nutrients, antibodies and hormonal signals and gets rid of waste through the placenta, a transient organ in which fetal blood interacts with maternal blood. Of these various roles, artificial-womb technology is most focused on providing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide, replacing the mechanical ventilators that are often used for neonates. These can damage fragile developing lungs that would otherwise still be filled with amniotic fluid.

== Cerebral palsy 脑瘫

*Cerebral palsy* (CP) is a group of *movement disorders* that appear in early childhood. Signs and symptoms vary (v.) among people and over time, but include *poor coordination* (n.)协作；协调；配合, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors (n.)（由于寒冷或恐惧等引起的）颤抖，战栗，哆嗦.  +

There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, and speaking. Often, babies with *cerebral palsy* do not *roll over* 翻滚,翻身, sit, crawl or walk *as early as* other children of their age.  +

Other symptoms include seizures  (心脏病、脑部疾病等的) 突然发作 and problems with thinking or reasoning, each of which occur in about one-third of people with CP.  +
While symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life, *underlying (a.) problems* do not worsen (v.) over time.

**脑瘫（CP）是一组出现在儿童早期的运动障碍。**体征和症状因人而异，随着时间的推移而有所不同，但**包括协调性差、肌肉僵硬、肌肉无力和颤抖。感觉、视力、听力和言语可能会出现问题。通常，患有脑瘫的婴儿不会像其他同龄儿童一样早翻身、坐下、爬行或行走。其他症状包括癫痫发作和思维或推理问题，**大约三分之一的脑瘫患者都会出现这些症状。*虽然症状在生命的最初几年可能会变得更加明显，但潜在的问题不会随着时间的推移而恶化。*

*Cerebral palsy* is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement, balance, and posture. Most often, the problems occur during pregnancy, but they may also occur during childbirth or shortly after birth. +
*脑瘫是由控制运动、平衡和姿势的大脑部分, 发育异常或受损引起的。大多数情况下，这些问题发生在怀孕期间，但也可能发生在分娩期间或出生后不久。*


Cerebral palsy is defined as "a group of *permanent disorders* of the development of movement and posture, causing (v.) activity limitation, that are attributed to non-progressive (a.) disturbances 障碍；失调；紊乱 that occurred in the developing fetal 胎儿的 or infant 婴儿；幼儿 brain."  +

While movement problems are *the central feature* of CP, difficulties with thinking, learning, feeling, communication and behavior often co-occur, with 28% having epilepsy  癫痫, 58% having difficulties with communication, at least 42% having problems with their vision, and 23–56% having learning disabilities.  +

Muscle contractions （肌肉的）收缩，挛缩；（尤指分娩时的）子宫收缩 in people with *cerebral palsy* are commonly thought (v.) to arise from overactivation 过度激活. +

脑瘫被定义为“一组运动和姿势发育的永久性障碍，导致活动受限，归因于发育中的胎儿或婴儿大脑中发生的非进行性障碍。”*虽然运动问题是 CP 的核心特征，但思考、学习、感觉、沟通和行为方面的困难常常同时出现*，28% 的人患有癫痫，58% 的人有沟通困难，至少 42% 的人有视力问题， 23-56% 有学习障碍。*通常认为脑瘫患者的肌肉收缩, 是由于过度激活引起的。*

The neurological lesion is primary and permanent while orthopedic manifestations are secondary and progressive. In cerebral palsy unequal growth between muscle-tendon units and bone eventually leads to bone and joint deformities. At first, deformities are dynamic. Over time, deformities tend to become static, and joint contractures develop. Deformities in general and static deformities in specific (joint contractures) cause increasing gait difficulties in the form of tip-toeing gait, due to tightness of the Achilles tendon, and scissoring gait, due to tightness of the hip adductors. These gait patterns are among the most common gait abnormalities in children with cerebral palsy. However, orthopaedic manifestations of cerebral palsy are diverse. Additionally, crouch gait (also described as knee flexion gait) is prevalent among children who possess the ability to walk. The effects of cerebral palsy fall on a continuum of motor dysfunction, which may range from slight clumsiness at the mild end of the spectrum to impairments so severe that they render coordinated movement virtually impossible at the other end of the spectrum. Although most people with CP have problems with increased muscle tone, some have normal or low muscle tone. High muscle tone can either be due to spasticity or dystonia. +

脑瘫的特点是肌张力、反射或运动发育和协调异常。神经系统病变是原发性和永久性的，而骨科表现是继发性和进行性的。**在脑瘫中，肌肉肌腱单位和骨骼之间的生长不均匀, 最终会导致骨骼和关节畸形。**首先，畸形是动态的。随着时间的推移，畸形趋于稳定，关节挛缩。一般畸形和特定的静态畸形（关节挛缩）会导致步态困难增加，如由于跟腱紧张而导致的踮脚步态，以及由于髋内收肌的紧张而导致的剪刀步态。这些步态模式是脑瘫儿童最常见的步态异常之一。然而，脑瘫的骨科表现多种多样。此外，蹲伏步态（也称为膝关节屈曲步态）在有行走能力的儿童中很常见。脑瘫的影响涉及一系列运动功能障碍，其范围可能从轻度的轻微笨拙到严重的损伤以致于在光谱的另一端几乎不可能协调运动。尽管大多数脑瘫患者都存在肌张力增加的问题，但有些人的肌张力正常或较低。高肌张力可能是由于痉挛或肌张力障碍所致。
