== No One Studied Menstrual Product Absorbency Realistically until Now 到目前为止，还没有人真正研究过月经产品的吸收性

Most convenience stores or pharmacies have an aisle dedicated to “feminine hygiene” filled with shelves of various menstrual products such as tampons, pads, cups and discs. +
大多数便利店或药店都有专门的“女性卫生”过道，货架上摆满了各种月经用品，如卫生棉条、护垫、杯子和圆盘。 +

On the side of each package, you’ll find a small “absorbency” label proclaiming how much liquid blood the product is designed to hold. +
在每个包装的侧面，您会发现一个小的“吸收性”标签，标明该产品设计可容纳多少液体血液。 +

But that number can be misleading. +
但这个数字可能会产生误导。 +

A team of researchers at Oregon Health & Science University found that many menstrual products had a much lower or higher liquid capacity than advertised when real blood was used instead of a saline solution—a mixture of water, salt and bicarbonate that is more commonly employed in the product development process. +
俄勒冈健康与科学大学的一组研究人员发现，当使用真正的血液而不是盐水溶液（更常用于月经中的水、盐和碳酸氢盐的混合物）时，许多月经产品的液体容量比广告中的要低或高得多。产品开发过程。 +

many of those initial studies used a saline solution rather than menstrual blood. +
许多最初的研究使用的是盐水溶液而不是经血。 +

Saline solutions are still predominantly employed to test menstrual products today. +
如今，盐溶液仍然主要用于测试月经产品。 +

Blood and saline solution have very different viscosities, meaning they are absorbed at different rates. +
血液和盐水溶液的粘度差异很大，这意味着它们的吸收速度不同。 +

The saying ‘blood is thicker than water’ is technically true. +
“血浓于水”这句话在技术上是正确的。 +

Saline solution is a homogenous mixture that is only slightly more viscous than distilled water. +
盐水溶液是均匀的混合物，仅比蒸馏水稍粘稠。 +

Blood, however, is not homogenous. +
然而，血液并不是同质的。 +

It is full of cells and platelets, as well as proteins and other molecules that move around and vary in concentration depending on a myriad of factors, such as how hydrated a person is. +
它充满了细胞和血小板，以及蛋白质和其他分子，它们四处移动，其浓度取决于多种因素，例如人的水分含量。 +

Menstrual blood is even more variable than circulating blood because it also contains vaginal secretions and tissue that has been shed from the uterine wall. +
经血比循环血液的变化更大，因为它还含有阴道分泌物和子宫壁脱落的组织。 +

Its viscosity can change from person to person and even hour to hour. +
它的粘度可能因人而异，甚至因小时而异。 +

These characteristics make it hard for manufacturers to accurately approximate the amount of blood a given period product will absorb based on tests that primarily use saline. +
这些特性使得制造商很难根据主要使用盐水的测试来准确估计给定时期产品将吸收的血液量。 +

In the new study, Samuelson Bannow and her team tested 21 different menstrual products, including discs, tampons, pads, period underwear and cups. +
在这项新研究中，Samuelson Bannow 和她的团队测试了 21 种不同的月经产品，包括月经垫、卫生棉条、卫生巾、经期内衣和月经杯。 +

They found that menstrual underwear products were the least absorbent ones on the market, soaking up one to three milliliters of blood, depending on size. +
他们发现，经期内衣产品是市场上吸水性最差的产品，根据尺寸的不同，只能吸收一到三毫升的血液。 +

“Light” pads were slightly more absorbent, maintaining 3 to 4 ml. +
“轻质”护垫的吸水性稍强，可保持 3 至 4 毫升。 +

Tampons held between 20 and 34 ml, depending on the brand and flow rating, and “heavy” pads, which advertised 10- to 20-ml capacity, could hold up to 52 ml. +
卫生棉条的容量为 20 至 34 毫升，具体取决于品牌和流量等级，而宣传容量为 10 至 20 毫升的“重型”卫生巾最多可容纳 52 毫升。 +

Menstrual discs held the most blood—61ml on average—with one brand holding up to 80 ml. +
月经盘可容纳的血液最多，平均为 61 毫升，其中一个品牌可容纳 80 毫升。 +

So why don’t period product manufacturers test absorbency with blood for better accuracy? +
那么，为什么经期产品制造商不使用血液来测试吸收性以获得更高的准确性呢？ +

Blood is a precious commodity. +
血液是一种珍贵的商品。 +

Approximately five million people in the U.S. need a blood transfusion every year, according to the National Institutes of Health. +
据美国国立卫生研究院称，美国每年约有 500 万人需要输血。 +

Even though about 6.8 million individuals donate blood annually, not all of those donations are compatible with the blood types of those who need them, and donations have a short shelf life (six weeks for red blood cells and five days for platelets). +
尽管每年约有 680 万人献血，但并非所有献血都与需要献血者的血型相容，而且献血的保质期很短（红细胞为六周，血小板为五天）。 +

Frequent blood shortages in hospitals make it difficult to justify using donations for anything other than transfusions. +
医院经常出现血液短缺，因此很难证明将捐献用于输血以外的其他用途。 +

The fluid is also considered a potential biohazard. +
该液体也被认为是潜在的生物危害。 +

Researchers who handle blood in the lab must undergo training and take special precautions to work with it safely. +
在实验室处理血液的研究人员必须接受培训并采取特殊的预防措施才能安全地处理血液。 +

In contrast, you don’t have to have any special training to work with saline. +
相比之下，您无需接受任何特殊培训即可使用盐水。 +

Additionally, blood—and artificial blood—is expensive. +
此外，血液和人造血液价格昂贵。
