== The view from the front line between Taiwan and China


Her affinity (n.)喜好；喜爱 to China was cultural, not political. In Taipei she joined *labour-rights campaigns*. Later, she studied in Beijing, where she saw how *grassroots activists* were suppressed. Now she calls herself Taiwanese. Already Kinmenese politicians *act “like obedient children”*, not equals, when they *interact with* Chinese officials, she says.

.affinity
/əˈfɪnəti/ (n.) [ sing.] ~ (for/with sb/sth)~ (between A and B) : a strong feeling that you understand sb/sth and like them or it 喜好；喜爱 +
-> 前缀af-同ad-, 去，往。词根fin, 范围，见finish. 原指结为亲家，纳入亲人范围，后指喜爱。

- Sam was born in the country and *had a deep affinity with* nature. 萨姆在乡下出生，特别喜爱大自然。

.obedient
/əˈbiːdiənt/ (a.) ~ (to sb/sth) doing what you are told to do; willing to obey 顺从的；忠顺的；唯命是从的 +
-> ob为前缀，表示"to"；词根edi和词根audi 同源，表示“听”。audi-算是常见词根了，同根词比如：audience（听众）、audible（听得见的）、auditorium（礼堂）等。什么话都“听”你的，就是“服从，听从”了。动词形式obey（服从，听从）。

- an obedient child 听话的孩子

她对中国的亲和力是文化上的，而不是政治上的。在台北，她参加了劳工权利运动。后来，她在北京读书，在那里她看到了草根活动家是如何被打压的。现在她称自己为台湾人。她说，*在与中国官员互动时，金门政客已经表现得“像听话的孩子”，而不是平等的。*
