年龄是痴呆症的最大风险因素，65 岁后, 患痴呆症的几率大约每五年翻一番。但是很多因素会影响特定个体的几率。遗传脆弱性是一个因素，所谓的可改变风险因素, 也是一个因素，例如吸烟、心血管疾病、社会孤立, 以及听力和视力受损。某些精神状况，尤其是抑郁症和精神分裂症，也与痴呆症有关。但由于抑郁症本身可能是认知能力下降的迹象，因此因果关系有点模糊。今年早些时候，对新西兰数据的分析, 提供了迄今为止最有说服力的证据，证明多种精神疾病与痴呆症有关。该研究提出了有关风险增加的原因, 以及可以采取哪些措施来降低风险。

研究发现，那些被诊断出精神障碍（例如焦虑症、抑郁症或双相情感障碍）的人最终患上痴呆症的几率是没有此类诊断的人的四倍。对于那些患有精神分裂症等精神病的人来说，这一比例是其六倍。在患有痴呆症的人中，患有精神疾病的人平均提前 5.6 年受到影响。

他们怀疑一个更重要的风险因素, 是**与精神疾病相关的"慢性压力"，随着时间的推移，这可能会降低大脑健康。**动物研究和人体解剖研究, 都将"慢性压力"与"海马体神经连接的丧失"联系起来. 海马体是大脑的记忆中心，而海马体是阿尔茨海默氏症的重灾区。哈佛大学神经学家和痴呆症研究员史蒂文阿诺德说，有证据表明，*压力会导致身体和大脑发生炎症和免疫失调，从而影响大脑连接。* “如果你一开始因为压力而减少了连接和突触，那么你就无法承受在衰老开始出现我们所谓的痴呆症之前, 失去那么多连接和突触。”换句话说，患有精神疾病的人, 可能拥有较少的“认知储备”——足以承受"正常衰老, 而不会明显丧失功能"的脑力。

这一人群的脆弱性, 也可能与他们发现在身体和社交方面更难过上健康的生活有关。 “他们可能运动量减少，或过度饮酒，或难以保持社交联系”——所有这些, 都会增加患痴呆症的风险。患有某些精神疾病的人, 往往有高于平均水平的吸烟率, 和较少的受教育年限，这些也是风险因素。

在一个理想的世界中，预防痴呆症的努力, 要从童年开始，大力投资于"教育"和"灌输健康"的习惯。

== Why Do Mental Illnesses—From Depression to Schizophrenia—Raise the Risk of Dementia?


Age is the single biggest risk factor for dementia, with the odds doubling about every five years after age 65. But many things influence those odds for a given individual. Genetic vulnerability is a contributor, as are so-called modifiable risk factors such as smoking, cardiovascular disease, social isolation, and impaired hearing and vision. Certain mental conditions, particularly depression and schizophrenia, have also been linked to dementia. But because depression can itself be a sign of cognitive decline, the causality has been a bit muddy. Earlier this year an analysis of data from New Zealand provided the most convincing evidence to date linking many kinds of mental illness with dementia. That study raises important questions about the reasons for this increased risk and what could be done to reduce it.

It found that those with a diagnosed mental disorder—such as anxiety disorders, depression or bipolar disorder—had four times the rate of ultimately developing dementia compared with people without such a diagnosis. For those with a psychosis such as schizophrenia, it was six times the rate. Among people who developed dementia, those with a psychiatric disorder were affected 5.6 years earlier, on average.


They suspect that a more significant risk factor is the chronic stress associated with having a psychiatric disorder, which may degrade brain health over time. Studies in animals as well as human autopsy studies have linked chronic stress to a loss of neural connections in the hippocampus, the brain's memory center, which is where Alzheimer's takes a heavy toll. Evidence suggests that stress drives inflammation and immune dysregulation in the body and brain, impacting brain connectivity, says Harvard University neurologist and dementia researcher Steven Arnold. “If you have fewer connections and synapses to begin with because of stress, then you can't afford to lose as many with aging before it starts to show up as what we might call dementia.” In other words, people with mental illnesses may have less “cognitive reserve”—brainpower that is sufficiently robust to withstand normal aging without obvious losses of function.

Vulnerability in this population may also be linked to their finding it more difficult to lead healthy lives, physically and socially, Richmond-Rakerd says. “They might exercise less, or drink alcohol excessively, or have trouble staying socially connected”—all of which increase the risk for dementia. People with certain psychiatric conditions tend to have higher-than-average rates of smoking and fewer years of education, which are also risk factors.


In an ideal world, Langa and other researchers say, efforts to prevent dementia would begin in childhood with strong investments in education and the inculcation of healthy habits.
