越来越多的人一致认为，从心理学的角度来看，“重视”是独立存在的，“没有其他的建构, 能够反映人们被他人看重, 和认为自己重要的需求”，安大略省约克大学的戈登·弗莱特说道，他是《重视心理学：理解人类的重要性需求》（2018）一书的作者。他表示，“重视”与自尊、社会支持, 和归属感, 有所重叠，但并不相同。他还说，*特别强大的是，与其他心理状态相比，'低重视感'更容易改变。这个目标可以通过多年的治疗来实现。*“人们可以学会以促进自己的重视感的方式, 与他人互动，”他说。

1981年，社会学家Morris Rosenberg 创建了一个五项事项的重要性量表，其中包括“其他人多少依赖您？”和“如果您离开了，会有多少人想念您？”Rosenberg 因其广泛使用的Rosenberg自尊量表而闻名，但最终测试该量表的不是他。在1990年代初，Rosenberg在一次年度会议上, 建议社会学家R. Jay Turner将"重要性量表"包含在计划中的多伦多社区调查中。1997年，Turner建议他的学生John Taylor（现为佛罗里达州立大学社会学家）分析其博士论文的调查数据。Taylor说，尽管这个量表在直觉上很有意义，但他不禁问自己，“这个"自我重要性感知", 是否只是"自尊心"变量概念的另一种马甲呢? (难道这只是不同包装的相同酒吗)？”。但是，在他进行的2001年关于"重要性"的研究之后，任何对此持有的疑虑都消失了。Taylor说：“*'自我重要性感知'这个因素, 是独立的, 是做出了其独特贡献的。即, 它与"自尊心"、"社会支持"和其他变量因素, 都不同. 它们不是一回事. '自我重要性感知'这个变量是独立的, 是"自我概念"的重要组成部分。*”

.MEASURING MATTERING

*Scales to assess mattering* have multiplied /in the ensuing 随后的 (时间) years. Besides Flett’s *Anti-Mattering Scale* (with items *such as* “To what extent have you been made /to feel you are invisible?”) and *a Work Mattering Scale*, developed by Ae-Kyung Jung and Mary J. Heppner .at the University of Missouri, scientists can now measure (v.) your sense of significance *to* family, *to* your university, and *to* the larger community and society. One scale *even does so* /for your romantic partner.

Mattering is defined as *consisting of* three components. Brown University sociologist Gregory Elliott *describes them as*:

- Awareness: Do people *pay attention to* you /or walk right by you? +
- Importance: Do you have people /who *take a real interest in* your well-being? +
- Reliance: Are there people /who would come to you for help, support or advice?

衡量"重要性"的量表, 其中所测量的问题清单数目, 已经增加了。除了Flett的"反重要性"量表（包括“您是否感到自己是无形的？”等项目）和由密苏里大学的Ae-Kyung Jung和Mary J. Heppner开发的"工作重要性"量表外，科学家现在可以衡量您在家庭、大学和更大社区和社会中的重要性。甚至有一个量表可以衡量您对恋人的重要性。

**重要性, 被定义为由三个组成部分组成。**布朗大学社会学家格雷戈里·艾略特（Gregory Elliott）将它们描述为：

- *意识：人们是否关注您或走过您？*
- *重要性：是否有人真正关心您的福祉？*
- *依赖：对你来说, 有这类人存在吗? 即是否有人会来找您寻求帮助、支持或建议？*

In teenagers, an absence of mattering *is highly destructive*.

**重要感（或不重要感）始于童年。“父母忽视之所以如此破坏性，”**Flett说，“是因为它向那些被认为是无关紧要、看不见和微不足道的孩子, 传递了信息。”

**在青少年中，缺乏重要性, 是非常破坏性的。在2009年对2,000名青少年进行的一项具有里程碑意义的研究中，艾略特发现，随着青少年"在家庭中感到重要性"的减少，反社会、攻击性, 或自我毁灭行为增加。相反，如果您相信自己对家庭很重要，那么您就不太可能走上歧途。**克莱姆森大学心理学家罗宾·科瓦尔斯基（Robin Kowalski）一直在编码Reddit“自杀观察”页面上青少年的帖子。她说：“约一半人觉得自己无关紧要”，并引用了“我只想有所作为”和“没有人关心我”的帖子。

*Allostatic load 是指由于个体长期处于应激状态下, 所引起的身体系统累积性损伤的总和。简单来说，它是身体对压力的适应过程所产生的"生物学性反应"的累积效果。* +
人们在面对不同类型的压力时，身体会释放出一系列的生物学性反应，如心率加快、血压升高、皮质醇分泌增加等。这些反应的频繁发生, 可以导致身体的器官系统长期处于高应激状态，最终导致机体的疾病风险增加。这些生物学性反应的累积效果, 就是 allostatic load。 +
Allostatic load通常用于描述心理应激和身体健康之间的关系，它可以反映出个体长期的心理应激水平，对于预测慢性疾病的风险, 有一定的参考价值。



泰勒（Taylor）在2001年的研究中, 将"重要性"与"心理健康"联系起来。在2018年的一项研究中，**他进一步表明了与"身体健康"的强相关性。**他和他的同事迈克尔·麦克法兰（Michael McFarland）和唐·卡尔（Dawn Carr）, 对1,026名田纳西州居民进行了深入的心理访谈，年龄在22岁至69岁之间，然后进行了一系列生理测量，如血压、皮质醇水平和臀围与腰围比。**研究小组发现，随着年龄的增长，压力对身体的总体磨损（allostatic load）增加，那些没有感到"自己对他人有强烈重要性"感觉的人, 具有更大的 allostatic load (适应负荷)。**他说：“*即使是'重要性'上微小的变化, 也比'社会支持'能更强地预测身体和心理健康。*

”'社会支持'被视为描述'身体健康恢复弹性'的决定性因素，但它也可以包括与'家庭关系不良'的关系。他说：*“重要性是一个更清晰的度量标准。”它只捕捉亲密个人关系的积极影响。”* (*就是说, "社会支持"和"被视为重要性" 是两个独立变量, "社会支持"能预测的范围更广; 而"被视为重要性"只预测人际关系和心理健康, 后者更精确!*)

== Do You ‘Matter’ to Others? The Answer Could Predict Your Mental Health

In South Carolina a grieving mother whose son died by suicide hands out stickers to young people. The sticker bears the words “Jackson Matters and So Do You.” To be important to others—to matter—has become more than just a truism. “You Matter” is the tagline of the National Suicide Prevention hotline. And the phrase “Black Lives Matter” calls attention to the exclusionary racism to which more than one in eight Americans is exposed.

Over the past 30 years, but never more so than now, psychologists have formalized “mattering” into a psychological construct that uniquely predicts depression, suicidal thoughts or other mental ills. It also foretells physical resilience among the elderly.

Increasingly a consensus is building that mattering stands on its own in psychological terms: “There is no other construct that gets at people’s need to feel valued and seen by others as important,” says Gordon Flett of York University in Ontario, author of The Psychology of Mattering: Understanding the Human Need to Be Significant (2018). Mattering overlaps with self-esteem, social support and a sense of belonging, he says, but is not identical. What’s especially powerful, he says, is that compared to other psychological states, a low sense of mattering is more amenable to change. And that goal can be achieved with years of therapy. “People can learn to engage with others in ways that foster their own sense of mattering,” he says.

In 1981 sociologist Morris Rosenberg created a five-item mattering scale with questions such as “How much do other people depend on you?” and “How much would you be missed if you went away?” Rosenberg, renowned for his widely used Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, was not the one who eventually tested the measure. In the early 1990s, over a beer at an annual meeting, Rosenberg suggested to sociologist R. Jay Turner that the mattering scale be included in a large, planned Toronto community survey. In 1997 Turner suggested to his student John Taylor, now a Florida State University sociologist, that he analyze the survey’s mattering data for his doctoral dissertation. As much as the scale made sense to him intuitively, Taylor says, he couldn’t help but ask himself, “Is it the same wine in a different bottle?”—perhaps just a repackaged form of self-esteem, for instance. But after a 2001 study he conducted on mattering, any lingering doubts vanished. “Mattering makes a unique contribution,” Taylor says. “It’s distinct from self-esteem, social support and other factors; it’s an important part of the self-concept.”

MEASURING MATTERING
Scales to assess mattering have multiplied in the ensuing years. Besides Flett’s Anti-Mattering Scale (with items such as “To what extent have you been made to feel you are invisible?”) and a Work Mattering Scale, developed by Ae-Kyung Jung and Mary J. Heppner at the University of Missouri, scientists can now measure your sense of significance to family, to your university, and to the larger community and society. One scale even does so for your romantic partner.

Mattering is defined as consisting of three components. Brown University sociologist Gregory Elliott describes them as:

Awareness: Do people pay attention to you or walk right by you?
Importance: Do you have people who take a real interest in your well-being?
Reliance: Are there people who would come to you for help, support or advice?

A sense of significance (or insignificance) begins in childhood. “What makes neglect by parents so destructive,” Flett says, is “the message it sends to the child who is made to feel irrelevant, invisible and insignificant.”

In teenagers, an absence of mattering is highly destructive. In a landmark study of 2,000 adolescents in 2009, Elliott found that as teens’ feeling of mattering in their family decreased, antisocial, aggressive or self-destructive behaviors rose. Conversely, if you believe you matter to your family, you are less likely to go astray. Clemson University psychologist Robin Kowalski has been coding teenagers’ posts on Reddit’s “Suicide Watch” page. “About half felt that they didn’t matter,” she says, citing posts such as “I just want to matter” and “No one cares about me.”

Taylor’s 2001 study linked mattering to mental health. In a 2018 study, he went further, showing a strong correlation with physical health. He and his colleagues Michael McFarland and Dawn Carr conducted in-depth psychological interviews of 1,026 Tennessee residents, ages 22 to 69, followed by a battery of physiological measurements such as blood pressure, cortisol levels and hip-to-waist ratio. The research team found that allostatic load—the general wear and tear of stress on the body over time—increased with age, and those who did not feel a strong sense of mattering to others had significantly greater allostatic load. “Even minute variations in mattering are stronger predictors of physical and mental health than social support,” he says. Social support is seen as a defining factor in describing physical resilience, but it can also encompass troubled relationships with family. “Mattering is a cleaner measure,” he says. “It captures only the positive effects of close personal ties.”

SCHOOL, WORK, COMMUNITY, SOCIETY
We derive our sense of significance not just from our personal relationships, says University of Miami community psychologist Isaac Prilleltensky, but from work and community. Prilleltensky created his own scale to measure this broadened measurement. In his Mattering in Domains of Life Scale (MIDLS), people assess their degree of feeling “worthy, acknowledged and appreciated,” as well their sense of contributing to others. These feelings relate to four domains: the self, relationships, work (paid or unpaid) and community.

Prilleltensky took those elements and created the image of a wheel with “mattering” occupying its center. “Feeling valued” and “adding value” form semicircles around the target, and an outer circle replicates the four domains for each of the “value” categories in the adjacent inner ring. The goal is to come up with a “virtuous cycle,” he wrote, “where the benefits of feeling valued will lead to adding value.” The more others make you feel you matter, he noted, the more likely you are to contribute to them, reaping notice and appreciation.

Mattering scales have begun to make appearances in the workplace. Investigating nurse burnout in a nationwide survey, Julie Haizlip, a nursing professor and pediatrician at the University of Virginia (UVA), and her colleagues found that nurses who reported higher levels of mattering to patients and co-workers had less burnout. “In health care, it seems to be more about the interpersonal than the organizational. Mattering occurs in the small moments,” Haizlip says. It might involve holding a frightened patient’s hand or your colleagues ordering lunch for you and knowing which sandwich you like.

In her current study of nursing and medical students at UVA and the Medical College of Wisconsin, Haizlip has learned that instilling a sense of mattering can be as simple as remembering students’ names during their rotations, a task helped along by distributing photographs of incoming students.

The importance of mattering differs by gender. When queried by researchers, women “almost universally” report higher levels of mattering in their relationships, Taylor says, and he notes that this has been true from the 1990s to today even through changes in women’s roles. Both men and women derive a sense of mattering from close relationships, but women do so more than men from their roles as parents and close friends, reports a recent study by Baylor University sociologists Rebecca Bonhag and Paul Froese.

Men’s sense of significance, the study finds, stems more from their perceived status and social class within the broader community and through membership in groups. Donating to local organizations, for example, is linked to mattering for men but less so for women. One intriguing finding is that men who strongly identified as Republican and were active on social media felt a greater sense of mattering; the same link was not found for men who were independents or Democrats. It’s not possible to say what causes what, but Bonhag speculates that men who have lost some sense of mattering find it in being strongly partisan. If that’s the case, she says, “that would be a troubling trend.” On the other hand, she suggests, social media may help men feel connected to others in ways women get from their close ties.

MATTERING, SUICIDE AND HOMICIDE
Not mattering to another person has been linked to both suicidal and even homicidal thinking. Several scholars have attributed mass shootings at least partly to such a deficit. The 2007 Virginia Tech shooter left a chilling manifesto, which Elliott paraphrases as “None of you recognize who I am, so I have to show you I’m important.” A 2003 study examined media reports of the writings of 10 mass shooters. A consistent theme, Flett says, could be summarized as “I have been made to feel like I don't matter, but I matter more than you people realize.”

As the mattering concept gains more notice, it is being incorporated into mental health interventions. The You Matter lifeline represents one key example. Calling 988 opens a way for people with suicidal thoughts to feel someone will listen and they will matter to another person.

Perceiving opportunities to become involved in an activity and to have a voice in decision-making, researchers found, increased middle schoolers’ sense of mattering in two rural Michigan school districts.

Simply noticing the kids, Maine’s Tinkham says, makes a difference: a store owner, for example, simply saying, “Justin, I haven’t seen you for a while. How you doing?” Many interventions occur spontaneously without an institution as an intermediary. Adolescents can join and volunteer in church or leadership groups. Helping others increases mattering. Older people, who connect socially on Facebook, some research has found, feel an increase in how much they matter to others as they interact with others more on the site.

For a neglected or abused child, an intervention may arrive as a trusted adult who cares and pays attention—a relative, a teacher, a coach. Some clinical accounts acknowledge that establishing the feeling of mattering might involve major life upheavals, but establishing it is by no means an impossible goal. “Once they matter to someone,” Flett says, “they can no longer think, ‘I don’t matter to anyone.’”
