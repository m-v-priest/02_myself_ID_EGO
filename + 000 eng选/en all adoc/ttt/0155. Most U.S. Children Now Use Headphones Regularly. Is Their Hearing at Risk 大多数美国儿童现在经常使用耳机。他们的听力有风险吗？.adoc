== Most U.S. Children Now Use Headphones Regularly. Is Their Hearing at Risk? 大多数美国儿童现在经常使用耳机。他们的听力有风险吗？



Hearing loss and tinnitus—a persistent sound such as ringing in the ears—affect tens of millions of Americans. These conditions have many root causes, but among the most common is noise exposure. Excessive noise can damage the thousands of tiny hair-shaped cells inside our ears. These delicate hairs vibrate when sound waves strike them but can be damaged or eventually killed by high-volume audio. Children’s ears are especially vulnerable to this type of damage. “Once those [hair cells] die, they don’t grow back.”

*听力损失和耳鸣*（一种持续存在的声音，例如耳鸣）影响着数千万美国人。**这些情况有很多根本原因，但最常见的是噪音暴露。过多的噪音会损害我们耳朵内数千个微小的毛发状细胞。当声波撞击这些脆弱的毛发时，它们会振动，但可能会被高音量的音频损坏或最终杀死。儿童的耳朵特别容易受到此类损伤。** “*一旦这些[毛细胞]死亡，它们就不会再长出来。*”

Some headphones can help block out some dangerously loud noises, such as roaring motorcycles or rock concerts, but they can also pump potentially damaging soundwaves directly into our ears. “If there’s background noise, the natural thing you do is bump up the volume”.

有些耳机可以帮助阻挡一些危险的大声噪音，例如咆哮的摩托车或摇滚音乐会，但它们也可以将潜在有害的声波直接泵入我们的耳朵。 “如果有背景噪音，你自然会做的就是调高音量.”

与耳机相关的听力损失也随之增加。除了听力损伤和耳鸣之外，持续接触噪音还与头痛、血压升高、睡眠中断和压力有关。

Noise above 120 decibels, roughly the volume of a jetliner taking off, can cause immediate hearing loss. But even less intense sounds can damage hearing if a person is subject to them for several hours straight. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers continuous exposure to noise above 85 decibels, the equivalent of operating a forklift or hair dryer, over the course of an eight-hour shift to be hazardous for workers.

**超过 120 分贝（大约相当于喷气式客机起飞时的音量）的噪音, 可能会立即导致听力损失。**但如果一个人连续几个小时受到这些声音的影响，即使是不太强烈的声音也会损害听力。例如，职业安全与健康管理局认为，在八小时轮班期间持续暴露在超过 85 分贝的噪音（相当于操作叉车或吹风机）, 对工人来说是危险的。

And these are just the limits for adults. “The younger you are, the lower the threshold that is safe” . Young people are more susceptible to hearing damage than adults because their ear canals tend to be narrower. This can amplify certain sounds as they travel to the inner ear. For preadolescents, prolonged exposure to noise above 70 decibels is considered hazardous by most pediatricians. (For infants, the limit tops out at around 60 decibels. Some studies suggest that even placing a white noise machine too close to a newborn’s head can lead to hearing loss.)

*而这些只是成年人的极限。 “你越年轻，安全的门槛就越低，*” **年轻人比成年人更容易受到听力损伤，因为他们的耳道往往更窄。当某些声音传播到内耳时，这可以放大它们。**对于青春期前的儿童来说，*大多数儿科医生认为长时间暴露在 70 分贝以上的噪音中是危险的。 （对于婴儿来说，极限值最高约为 60 分贝。一些研究表明，即使将白噪声机放置得太靠近新生儿的头部也会导致听力损失。）*

Woolford recommends that parents encourage their children to follow the “60/60 rule”: no more than 60 minutes of headphone use at a time at no more than 60 percent volume.
