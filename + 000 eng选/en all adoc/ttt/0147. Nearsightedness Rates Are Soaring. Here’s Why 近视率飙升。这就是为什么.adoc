== Nearsightedness Rates Are Soaring. Here’s Why  近视率飙升。这就是为什么


first let’s examine what causes myopia – and what reduces it.

[.my2]
首先让我们看看是什么导致了近视，以及是什么减少了近视。



==== HOW MYOPIA DEVELOPS

[.my2]
近视如何发展


While having two myopic parents does mean you’re more likely to be nearsighted, there’s no single myopia gene. That means the causes of myopia are more behavioral than genetic.

[.my2]
虽然有两个患近视的父母, 确实意味着你更有可能近视，但**不存在单一的近视基因。这意味着近视的原因, 更多是行为原因, 而不是遗传原因。**


Optometrists have learned a great deal about the progression of myopia by studying visual development in infant chickens. They do so by putting little helmets on baby chickens. Lenses on the face of the helmet cover the chicks’ eyes and are adjusted to affect how much they see.

[.my2]
验光师通过研究小鸡的视觉发育，对近视的进展有了很多了解。他们通过给小鸡戴上小头盔来做到这一点。头盔表面的镜片, 遮住小鸡的眼睛，并进行调整以影响它们看到的程度。

Just like in humans, if visual input is distorted, a chick’s eyes grow too large, resulting in myopia. And it’s progressive. Blur leads to eye growth, which causes more blur, which makes the eye grow even larger, and so on.

[.my2]
*就像人类一样，如果视觉输入被扭曲，小鸡的眼睛会变得太大，导致近视。它是渐进的(互相促进的)。模糊会导致眼睛变大，而眼睛变大又会导致更多的模糊，从而使眼睛变得更大，如此循环。*

Two recent studies featuring extensive surveys of children and their parents provide strong support for the idea that an important driver of the uptick in myopia is that people are spending more time focusing on objects immediately in front of our eyes, whether a screen, a book or a drawing pad. The more time we spend focusing on something within arm’s length of our faces, dubbed “near work,” the greater the odds of having myopia.

[.my2]
最近的两项研究对儿童及其父母进行了广泛的调查，有力地支持了这样一种观点，即**近视增加的一个重要驱动因素, 是人们花更多的时间关注眼前的物体，无论是屏幕、书籍还是一个绘图板。我们花在距脸部一臂距离(用手机)（即“近距离工作”）上的时间越多，患近视的可能性就越大。**

So as much as people might blame new technologies like smartphones and too much “screen time” for hurting our eyes, the truth is even activities as valuable as reading a good book can affect your eyesight.

[.my2]
因此，尽管人们可能会指责"智能手机"等新技术和过多的“屏幕时间”伤害了我们的眼睛，但**事实是，即使是像阅读一本好书这样有价值的活动, 也会影响您的视力。(所以要多远眺, 少近看)**

[.my2]
外部光线可预防近视


Other research has shown that this unnatural eye growth can be interrupted by sunlight.

[.my2]
其他研究表明，这种不自然的眼睛生长, 可能会被阳光打断。

A 2022 study, for example, found that myopia rates were more than four times greater for children who didn’t spend much time outdoors – say, once or twice a week – compared with those who were outside daily. At the same time, kids who spent more than three hours a day while not at school reading or looking at a screen close-up were four times more likely to have myopia than those who spent an hour or less doing so.

[.my2]
例如，2022 年的一项研究发现，*与每天都在户外活动的儿童相比，那些没有花太多时间在户外活动（例如每周一次或两次）的儿童的近视率, 高出四倍多。与此同时，每天在学校阅读或观看屏幕特写的时间, 不超过三个小时的孩子, 患近视的可能性, 是那些每天只花一个小时或更少的孩子的四倍。(即, 多到外面玩, 少看电子产品, 才能预防近视)*




In another paper, from 2012, researchers conducted a meta-analysis of seven studies that compared duration of time spent outdoors with myopia incidence. They also found that more time spent outdoors was associated with lower myopia incidence and progression. The odds of developing myopia dropped by 2% for each hour spent outside per week.

[.my2]
在 2012 年的另一篇论文中，研究人员对七项研究进行了荟萃分析，比较了户外活动时间与近视发生率。他们还发现，*在户外度过的时间越多，近视的发病率和进展就越低。每周在户外活动一小时，患近视的几率就会下降 2%。*

Other researchers have reported similar effects and argued for much more time outdoors and changes in early-age schooling to reduce myopia prevalence.

[.my2]
其他研究人员也报告了类似的效果，并主张**增加户外活动时间并改变早期教育，以减少近视患病率。**



The two main factors identified as leading to increased myopia are increased reading and other activities that require focusing on an object close to one’s eyes and a reduction in time spent outdoors.

[.my2]
*导致近视增加的两个主要因素, 是"阅读"和"其他需要聚焦于眼睛附近物体的活动"的增加, 以及"户外活动时间的减少"。*



==== TREATING MYOPIA

[.my2]
治疗近视

Fortunately, just a few minutes a day with glasses or contact lenses that correct for blur stops the progression of myopia, which is why early vision testing and vision correction are important to limit the development of myopia. Eye checks for children are mandatory in some countries, such as the U.K.and now China, as well as most U.S. states.

[.my2]
幸运的是，*每天只需佩戴几分钟的眼镜或隐形眼镜, 来矫正模糊，就可以阻止近视的进展，这就是为什么早期视力测试和视力矫正, 对于限制"近视"的发展非常重要。*


People with with high myopia, however, have increased risk of blindness and other severe eye problems, such as retinal detachment, in which the retina pulls away from the the back of the eye. The chances of myopia-related macular degeneration increase by 40% for each diopter of myopia. A diopter is a unit of measurement used in eye prescriptions.

[.my2]
*然而，高度近视患者, "失明"和"其他严重眼部问题"的风险增加，例如"视网膜脱离"，即视网膜脱离眼睛后部。近视度数每增加一个屈光度，患近"视相关黄斑变性"的几率就会增加 40%。"屈光度"是眼科处方中使用的测量单位。*


But there appear to be two sure-fire ways to offset or delay these effects: Spend less time focusing on objects close to your face, like books and smartphones, and spend more time outside in the bright, natural light. Given the first one is difficult advice to take in our modern age, the next best thing is taking frequent breaks – or perhaps spend more time reading and scrolling outside in the sun.

[.my2]
**但似乎有两种可靠的方法, 可以抵消或延迟这些影响：少花时间关注靠近脸部的物体，例如书籍和智能手机，多花时间在户外明亮的自然光下。**鉴于第一个建议在我们这个时代很难接受，那么**第二个最好的办法就是经常休息——或者花更多的时间在阳光下阅读和滚动。**
