== COVID-19 Leaves Its Mark on the Brain. Significant Drops in IQ Scores Are Noted COVID-19 在大脑中留下了印记。智商分数显着下降


From the very early days of the pandemic, brain fog emerged as a significant health condition that many experience after COVID-19.
Brain fog is a colloquial term that describes a state of mental sluggishness or lack of clarity and haziness that makes it difficult to concentrate, remember things and think clearly.
Fast-forward four years and there is now abundant evidence that being infected with SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – can affect brain health in many ways.
In addition to brain fog, COVID-19 can lead to an array of problems, including headaches, seizure disorders, strokes, sleep problems, and tingling and paralysis of the nerves, as well as several mental health disorders.

从大流行初期开始，脑雾就成为许多人在 COVID-19 后经历过的一种重要健康状况。脑雾是一个口语术语，描述一种精神迟缓或缺乏清晰度和模糊的状态，导致难以集中注意力、记忆事物和清晰思考。四年过去了，现在有大量证据表明，感染 SARS-CoV-2（导致 COVID-19 的病毒）会以多种方式影响大脑健康。*除了脑雾之外，COVID-19 还可能导致一系列问题，包括头痛、癫痫发作、中风、睡眠问题、神经刺痛和麻痹，以及多种精神健康障碍。*


Here are some of the most important studies to date documenting how COVID-19 affects brain health:

[.my2]
以下是迄今为止一些最重要的研究，记录了 COVID-19 如何影响大脑健康：

- Large epidemiological analyses showed that people who had COVID-19 were at an increased risk of cognitive deficits, such as memory problems.

[.my2]
大型流行病学分析表明，*患有 COVID-19 的人出现认知缺陷（例如记忆问题）的风险增加。*

- Imaging studies done in people before and after their COVID-19 infections show shrinkage of brain volume and altered brain structure after infection.

[.my2]
对感染 COVID-19 之前和之后的人进行的影像学研究显示，*感染后大脑体积缩小，大脑结构发生变化。*

- A study of people with mild to moderate COVID-19 showed significant prolonged inflammation of the brain and changes that are commensurate with seven years of brain aging.

[.my2]
*一项针对轻度至中度 COVID-19 患者的研究显示，大脑出现明显长期炎症，并且发生了与大脑老化七年相称的变化。*

- Severe COVID-19 that requires hospitalization or intensive care may result in cognitive deficits and other brain damage that are equivalent to 20 years of aging.

[.my2]
*需要住院或重症监护的严重 COVID-19 可能会导致认知缺陷和其他脑损伤，相当于衰老 20 岁。*

- Laboratory experiments in human and mouse brain organoids designed to emulate changes in the human brain showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the fusion of brain cells. This effectively short-circuits brain electrical activity and compromises function.

[.my2]
旨在模拟人脑变化的人和小鼠大脑类器官的实验室实验表明，*SARS-CoV-2 感染会触发脑细胞的融合。这会有效地短路脑电活动并损害功能。*

- Autopsy studies of people who had severe COVID-19 but died months later from other causes showed that the virus was still present in brain tissue. This provides evidence that contrary to its name, SARS-CoV-2 is not only a respiratory virus, but it can also enter the brain in some individuals. But whether the persistence of the virus in brain tissue is driving some of the brain problems seen in people who have had COVID-19 is not yet clear.

[.my2]
对患有严重 COVID-19 , 但在几个月后因其他原因死亡的人, 进行的尸检研究表明，该病毒仍然存在于脑组织中。这提供了证据，与它的名字相反，**SARS-CoV-2不仅是一种呼吸道病毒，而且还可以进入某些个体的大脑。**但病毒在脑组织中的持续存在, 是否会导致 COVID-19 患者出现一些脑部问题，目前尚不清楚。

- Studies show that even when the virus is mild and exclusively confined to the lungs, it can still provoke inflammation in the brain and impair brain cells’ ability to regenerate.

[.my2]
研究表明，*即使病毒很​​温和, 并且仅局限于肺部，它仍然会引起大脑炎症, 并损害脑细胞的再生能力。*

- COVID-19 can also disrupt the blood brain barrier, the shield that protects the nervous system – which is the control and command center of our bodies – making it “leaky.” Studies using imaging to assess the brains of people hospitalized with COVID-19 showed disrupted or leaky blood brain barriers in those who experienced brain fog.

[.my2]
COVID-19 还会破坏"血脑屏障"，即保护神经系统（我们身体的控制和指挥中心）的屏障，使其“渗漏”。使用成像技术评估因 COVID-19 住院的患者的大脑的研究表明，*经历过脑雾的患者的"血脑屏障"被破坏或渗漏。*

- A large preliminary analysis pooling together data from 11 studies encompassing almost one million people with COVID-19 and more than 6 million uninfected individuals showed that COVID-19 increased the risk of development of new-onset dementia in people older than 60 years of age.

[.my2]
一项大型初步分析汇集了 11 项研究的数据，这些研究涵盖了近 100 万 COVID-19 感染者和超过 600 万未感染者，结果表明，*COVID-19 增加了 60 岁以上人群患新发痴呆的风险。*

- Autopsies have revealed devastating damage in the brains of people who died with COVID-19.

[.my2]
尸检显示，*死于 COVID-19 的人的大脑受到了毁灭性的损伤。*

Most recently, a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine assessed cognitive abilities such as memory, planning and spatial reasoning in nearly 113,000 people who had previously had COVID-19. The researchers found that those who had been infected had significant deficits in memory and executive task performance.
This decline was evident among those infected in the early phase of the pandemic and those infected when the delta and omicron variants were dominant. These findings show that the risk of cognitive decline did not abate as the pandemic virus evolved from the ancestral strain to omicron.

[.my2]
最近，《新英格兰医学杂志》发表的一项新研究评估了近 113,000 名曾感染过 COVID-19 的人的认知能力，例如记忆、计划和空间推理。研究人员发现，*那些被感染的人在记忆力和执行任务表现方面有明显的缺陷。*
这种下降, 在大流行早期感染者以及 delta 和 omicron 变种占主导地位时感染的人中, 很明显。这些发现表明，*随着大流行病毒从祖先毒株进化为 omicron，认知能力下降的风险并没有减弱。*

In the same study, those who had mild and resolved COVID-19 showed cognitive decline equivalent to a three-point loss of IQ. In comparison, those with unresolved persistent symptoms, such as people with persistent shortness of breath or fatigue, had a six-point loss in IQ. Those who had been admitted to the intensive care unit for COVID-19 had a nine-point loss in IQ. Reinfection with the virus contributed an additional two-point loss in IQ, as compared with no reinfection. +
Generally the average IQ is about 100. An IQ above 130 indicates a highly gifted individual, while an IQ below 70 generally indicates a level of intellectual disability that may require significant societal support.

[.my2]
在同一项研究中，那些患有轻度并已治愈的 COVID-19 的人表现出相当于智商下降 3 分的认知能力下降。相比之下，那些持续症状未解决的人，例如持续呼吸短促或疲劳的人，智商下降了六分。那些因 COVID-19 入住重症监护室的人智商下降了 9 分。与没有再次感染相比，再次感染病毒导致智商额外下降两分。 +
*一般来说，平均智商约为 100。智商高于 130 表明个人有很高的天赋，而智商低于 70 通常表明智力有缺陷，可能需要大量的社会支持。*

...And the extent to which these shifts will influence the epidemiology of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease is also not clear.

[.my2]
*这些变化将在多大程度上影响痴呆症和阿尔茨海默病的流行病学, 也尚不清楚。*
