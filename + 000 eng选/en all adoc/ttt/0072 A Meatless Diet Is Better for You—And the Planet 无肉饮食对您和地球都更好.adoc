The idea that we need to eat meat to get enough protein and iron, a false assumption of some Paleo 古, 古代的 diet acolytes 追随者, is a common misconception 错误观念.

我们需要吃肉才能获得足够的蛋白质和铁，这是一些古式饮食拥护者的错误假设，是一种常见的误解。它忽略了许多植物性食品（如坚果、种子和豆类）中丰富的蛋白质和铁。同样，食用乳制品并不是获得足够膳食钙的必要条件，因为这种矿物质在大豆、扁豆、蚕豆、坚果、种子、谷物、绿叶蔬菜和十字花科蔬菜中, 含量丰富。

地中海饮食（Mediterranean diet），是泛指希腊、西班牙、法国和意大利南部等处于地中海沿岸的南欧各国, 以蔬菜水果、鱼类、五谷杂粮、豆类和橄榄油为主的饮食风格。研究发现地中海饮食可以减少患心脏病的风险，还可以保护大脑免受血管损伤，降低发生中风和记忆力减退的风险。


越来越多的证据表明全食物、植物性饮食的好处。对 2017 年科学研究的荟萃分析发现，素食可将冠心病的相对风险降低 25%，将癌症的相对风险降低 8%，而纯素饮食可将癌症的相对风险降低 15% 。世界卫生组织 (WHO) 将加工肉类列为致癌物质，将（未加工的）红肉列为可能对人类致癌的肉类。最后，随机对照试验还证明了地中海饮食（本质上是一种全食、以植物为主的饮食）在心血管疾病的一级和二级预防中的益处，并且更坚持素食主义者（更多的植物性饮食）可以增强益处。基于）饮食模式。
