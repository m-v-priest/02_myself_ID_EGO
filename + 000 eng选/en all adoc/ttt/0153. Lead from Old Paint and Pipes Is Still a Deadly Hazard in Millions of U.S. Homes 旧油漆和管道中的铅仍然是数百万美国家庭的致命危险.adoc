== Lead from Old Paint and Pipes Is Still a Deadly Hazard in Millions of U.S. Homes 旧油漆和管道中的铅仍然是数百万美国家庭的致命危险


Lead is a potent neurotoxin that causes severe health effects such as neurological damage, organ failure and death.

[.my2]
**铅是一种强效神经毒素，会导致严重的健康影响，例如神经损伤、器官衰竭和死亡。**


Widely used in products such as paint and gasoline until the late 1970s, lead continues to contaminate environments and harm the health of people around the world. Lead continues leaching from old paint, pipes and industrial sources into soils, homes and waterways across the globe.

[.my2]
**直到 20 世纪 70 年代末，铅还广泛用于油漆和汽油等产品，**但它仍在继续污染环境并危害世界各地人们的健康。*铅继续从旧油漆、管道和工业来源中, 浸出到全球各地的土壤、家庭和水道中。*

This preventable health crisis especially threatens children during periods of critical brain development but can also impair intellectual development and long-term health in adults.

[.my2]
这种可预防的健康危机, *尤其威胁到大脑发育关键时期的儿童，但也可能损害成年人的智力发育和长期健康。*


==== HOW LEAD DAMAGES THE BODY

[.my2]
铅如何损害身体


Lead enters the body through three routes: ingestion, absorption or inhalation. Once inside, lead mimics calcium by binding to proteins and enzymes where calcium is typically involved.

[.my2]
*"铅"通过三种途径进入人体：摄入、吸收, 或吸入。一旦进入内部，铅就会通过与通常涉及钙的蛋白质和酶结合, 来模仿钙。*

Lead looks a lot like calcium to many of the systems in our body. By hijacking these calcium-dependent processes, lead disrupts many normal functions ranging from neurological function to cardiovascular health.

[.my2]
*对于我们体内的许多系统来说，铅看起来很像钙。通过劫持这些钙依赖性过程，铅会破坏从"神经功能"到"心血管健康"等许多正常功能。*

When lead replaces calcium in these processes, it causes irreversible damage, even at low levels of chronic exposure. Studies show that low levels of lead are associated with dangerous lifelong illnesses such as Alzheimer’s and heart disease.

[.my2]
当"铅"在这些过程中取代"钙"时，即使长期接触低水平，也会造成不可逆转的损害。研究表明，*"低水平的铅"与危险的终生疾病有关，例如阿尔茨海默病和心脏病。*

Furthermore, like calcium, lead accumulates in our teeth and bones. This compounds lead’s adverse effects as our bodies grow and age, since the lead in bone will reappear as our body looks to its calcium stores during periods of growth or, critically, during pregnancy.

[.my2]
**此外，像钙一样，铅也会积聚在我们的牙齿和骨骼中。**随着我们身体的成长和衰老，这种复合铅会产生不利影响，因为**当我们的身体在生长期间, 或更重要的是在怀孕期间寻找"钙储备"时，骨骼中的"铅"会重新出现。**

Lead exposure can come from many sources in our daily life, from water systems using lead water lines and legacy exposures from old paint to things that people often don’t think about, such as lead in firearms or metal pots and pans.

[.my2]
*铅暴露, 可能来自我们日常生活中的许多来源，从使用含铅水管的供水系统和旧油漆遗留的暴露，到人们经常没有想到的东西，例如枪支或金属锅碗瓢盆中的铅。*

Researchers often see exposures from soils in highly polluted areas, but sometimes it can be present in old donated toys at a child’s day care.

[.my2]
研究人员经常看到来自高度污染地区土壤的暴露，但有时也可能存在于儿童日托所捐赠的旧玩具中。


==== HOW TESTING IS DONE

[.my2]
测试是如何进行的

Monitoring lead levels typically involves a simple blood test, generally ordered by your doctor. These tests are widely available but can easily be inaccurate based on when the test was taken. Since blood lead levels can change quickly, children who get tested several weeks after exposure could falsely test as normal.

[.my2]
**监测"铅含量"通常需要进行简单的血液检查，**通常由医生要求进行。这些测试广泛可用，*但根据测试的进行时间很容易不准确。由于血铅水平会迅速变化，因此在接触后几周接受检测的儿童, 可能会误认为检测结果正常。*

Moreover, because there is no requirement for doctors to be trained in how to test for and treat lead exposure, many pediatricians lack awareness about lead screening protocols. As a result, many at-risk people are not being tested.

[.my2]
此外，由于没有要求医生接受如何检测和治疗铅暴露的培训，许多儿科医生缺乏对铅筛查方案的认识。因此，许多高危人群没有接受检测。

When tests are given, they may yield inaccurate results due to the rapid changes in blood lead. Or sometimes results are not properly reported to local health departments. Further complicating this, in 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that the country’s progress in removing lead from gasoline was a great public health achievement. As a result, many lead-testing programs in the U.S. were discontinued, leading to critical information gaps.

[.my2]
进行测试时，**由于血铅的快速变化，可能会产生不准确的结果。**或者有时结果没有正确报告给当地卫生部门。使情况变得更加复杂的是，*2010 年，美国疾病控制与预防中心宣布，该国在去除汽油中铅方面取得的进展是一项伟大的公共卫生成就。结果，美国的许多铅测试项目被终止，导致严重的信息缺口。*



Blood is by far the most widely used indicator for lead exposure. However, in blood, lead dissipates quickly, and after about a few weeks to a month, an exposure that was high enough to cause damage is no longer measurable from blood lead.

[.my2]
*血液是迄今为止使用最广泛的"铅暴露"指标。然而，在血液中，铅很快就会消散，大约几周到一个月后，就无法再通过"血铅"测量到足以造成损害的暴露程度。*



Bone lead is reflective of years to decades of exposure and is a more accurate test to reflect the permanence of damage induced by lead in the body. Bone lead has also been shown to have a strong relationship with lead accumulation in the brain, since lead hijacks places in both the bone and the brain where calcium is normally present.

[.my2]
**骨铅(骨骼中的铅)反映了数年至数十年的暴露情况，是反映铅在体内造成的持久性损害的更准确的测试。**骨铅也被证明与"大脑中铅的积累"有很强的关系，*因为"铅"劫持了骨骼和大脑中"钙"通常存在的地方。*



==== WHAT YOU CAN DO

[.my2]
你可以做什么

People concerned about lead exposure should request a blood lead test from their doctor. Parents of young children should proactively ask pediatricians to conduct lead screening. If you live in an old home, especially one with peeling paint, you can contact your local health department to test for possible lead paint.

[.my2]
**担心铅暴露的人, 应该要求医生进行血铅测试。**幼儿家长应主动要求儿科医生进行铅筛查。*如果您住在老房子里，尤其是油漆剥落的房子，您可以联系当地的卫生部门, 测试可能的含铅油漆。*

Additionally, your local water service provider should be able to tell you if lead water lines are in use leading to your home. Unfortunately, lead has no particular smell or taste to differentiate it from other possible contaminants.

[.my2]
此外，您当地的供水服务提供商, 应该能够告诉您通向您家的是否使用"含铅水管"。*不幸的是，铅没有特殊的气味或味道, 来区分它与其他可能的污染物。*


For very high exposures, a treatment known as chelation therapy, which involves an oral medication that binds to lead so that it can be excreted in urine, has been shown to be effective at reducing blood lead levels.

[.my2]
对于非常高的暴露量，一种称为"螯合疗法"的治疗方法, 已被证明可以有效降低"血铅"水平，该疗法涉及与铅结合的口服药物，使其可以通过尿液排出体外。
