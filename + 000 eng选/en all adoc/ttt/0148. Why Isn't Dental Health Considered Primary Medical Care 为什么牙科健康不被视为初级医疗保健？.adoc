== Why Isn't Dental Health Considered Primary Medical Care? 为什么牙科健康不被视为初级医疗保健？


Historically, dentistry and medicine have operated as parallel fields: Dentists take care of the mouth, physicians the rest of the body. That is starting to change as many initiatives across the United States and other countries work to integrate oral and whole-body care to more effectively tackle diabetes, cardiovascular disease, joint replacements and many other conditions. The exact relationship between health of mouth and teeth and physical ailments elsewhere in the body is not well understood — and in some cases, is contentious — but experts agree there are links that should no longer be overlooked.

从历史上看，牙科和医学一直作为平行领域运作：牙医负责口腔护理，医生负责身体的其他部位。随着美国和其他国家的许多举措致力于整合口腔和全身护理，以更有效地应对糖尿病、心血管疾病、关节置换和许多其他疾病，这种情况开始发生变化。*口腔和牙齿的健康, 与身体其他部位的身体疾病之间的确切关系, 尚不清楚——在某些情况下，还存在争议——但专家们一致认为，其中存在着不应再被忽视的联系。*


==== SICK MOUTH, SICK BODY

[.my2]
嘴巴有病，身体有病

The list of connections between oral health and systemic health — conditions that affect the entire body — is remarkable. For starters, three common dental issues — cavities, tooth loss and periodontal disease — are all associated with heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.

[.my2]
口腔健康和全身健康（影响整个身体的状况）之间的联系非常显着。首先，**三种常见的牙齿问题——蛀牙、牙齿脱落, 和牙周病——都与心脏病有关，**心脏病是美国的主要死亡原因。


Periodontal disease, infection and inflammation of the gums and bone that support the teeth, is the main culprit. Nearly half of adults 30 and older have periodontal disease; by age 65, the rate climbs to about 70 percent. In the early stages, called gingivitis, gums are swollen and may bleed. Periodontitis, a more serious condition in which gums can pull away from the teeth, is the sixth most common human disease.

[.my2]
-> **牙周病，即支撑牙齿的牙龈和骨骼的"感染"和"炎症"，是罪魁祸首。**近一半 30 岁及以上的成年人患有"牙周病"；**到 65 岁时，这一比例攀升至 70% 左右。**** +
-> 在称为"牙龈炎"的早期阶段，牙龈肿胀并可能出血。**  +
-> **"牙周炎"是一种更严重的疾病，牙龈可能会脱离牙齿，**是第六大常见的人类疾病。

Periodontitis is associated with a slew of systemic ills: heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, diabetes, endocarditis, chronic kidney disease, recurrent pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and cognitive impairment.

[.my2]
**牙周炎与一系列全身性疾病有关：**心脏病、中风、心力衰竭、糖尿病、心内膜炎、慢性肾病、复发性肺炎、慢性阻塞性肺病、胃炎、类风湿性关节炎、癌症和认知障碍。

Bad habits, including tobacco use, alcohol consumption and high-sugar diets, are implicated too. They raise the risk for cavities and most oral diseases, and are also linked to ills such as cancer, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes.

[.my2]
不良习惯，包括吸烟、饮酒和高糖饮食，也与此有关。它们会增加蛀牙和大多数口腔疾病的风险，并且还与癌症、慢性呼吸道疾病, 和糖尿病等疾病有关。


Despite their disparate training, both doctors and dentists are aware that mouth health is important to whole-body health. “Ask a family practice doctor and they will say ‘Oh yeah, if the patient has diabetes, they’re going to have bad teeth and gums, and I can never get their diabetes better until the dentist fixes their gums,’” she says. “And the dentist is going to say, ‘Well, I’ll never get their gums better until the primary care doctor gets their sugar under control.’”

[.my2]
尽管接受的培训不同，但医生和牙医都意识到口腔健康对全身健康很重要。 “询问家庭医生，他们会说‘哦，是的，**如果病人患有糖尿病，他们的牙齿和牙龈都会不好，**而除非牙医修复他们的牙龈，否则我永远无法让他们的糖尿病好转，’”她说。 “牙医会说，‘好吧，*在初级保健医生控制他们的血糖之前，我永远不会让他们的牙龈变得更好。*’”



==== HURDLES TO HOLISTIC CARE

[.my2]
整体护理的障碍

But working together to improve a patient’s health is not as simple as it might seem. Three barriers to integration became clear.

[.my2]
但共同努力改善患者的健康并不像看起来那么简单。整合的三个障碍变得显而易见。


The fragmented way that health care and dental care are paid for is one of them. While more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance, only 77 percent of US adults ages 19 to 64 have dental coverage, which typically is sold separately from health insurance. The nation’s largest insurer — the federal Medicare program — generally does not cover dental services, and nearly half of Americans 65 and over have no dental coverage.

[.my2]
医疗保健和牙科保健的支离破碎的支付方式, 就是其中之一。虽然超过 90% 的美国人拥有健康保险，但只有 77% 的 19 至 64 岁美国成年人拥有牙科保险，而"牙科保险"通常与"健康保险"分开出售。美国最大的保险公司——联邦医疗保险计划——通常不承保牙科服务，65 岁及以上的美国人中, 近一半没有"牙科保险"。

That causes problems for patients who need, say, a joint replacement that would be covered by insurance but who cannot afford the dental work that is needed in advance. Surgeons won’t replace a knee until patients first get their dental work done, Mancini says, “so we’re kind of the barrier to them improving their life.”

[.my2]
这给那些需要"关节置换术"的患者带来了问题，"关节置换术"将由保险承保，但他们无法承担提前所需的牙科治疗费用。曼奇尼说，在患者完成牙科工作之前，外科医生不会更换膝盖，“所以我们是他们改善生活的障碍。”

Another barrier is that dentists and physicians are not routinely trained to work with each other.

[.my2]
另一个障碍是, 牙医和医生没有接受过相互合作的常规培训。


Dental students study anatomy, physiology and other sciences related to the whole body, then home in on clinical care for mouth and teeth. But many physicians have almost no training in oral health.

[.my2]
牙科学生学习解剖学、生理学, 和其他与全身相关的科学，然后专注于口腔和牙齿的临床护理。但**许多医生几乎没有接受过口腔健康方面的培训。**

A third issue is what Hilton calls infrastructure. In most cases, the electronic health records used by physicians are incompatible with those used by dentists, so sharing information electronically is impossible. Likewise, dental offices are typically not embedded in medical clinics, where doctor-dentist referrals might be easier.

[.my2]
第三个问题是希尔顿所说的基础设施。在大多数情况下，"医生"使用的电子健康记录, 与"牙医"使用的电子健康记录, 不兼容，因此不可能以电子方式共享信息。同样，"牙科诊所"通常不设在"医疗诊所"内，在那里医生"牙医转诊"可能更容易。

==== DEMONSTRATED LINKS

[.my2]
展示相关联系



In the past quarter-century, a great deal of research has demonstrated the links between oral and whole-body health. For example, when researchers followed 15,456 patients from 39 countries with stable coronary heart disease for nearly four years, they found that those who had lost the most teeth had the highest risk of having a stroke, heart attack or cardiovascular death. Similarly, a study that tracked 7,466 US adults ages 44 to 66 for an average of 14.7 years revealed that those who had severe periodontitis had a greater risk of cancer than those with no or mild periodontitis.

[.my2]
在过去的四分之一个世纪中，大量研究证明了口腔与全身健康之间的联系。例如，研究人员对来自 39 个国家的 15,456 名患有稳定冠心病的患者, 进行了近四年的跟踪调查，结果发现，**牙齿脱落最多的人, 患中风、心脏病或心血管死亡的风险最高。**同样，一项对 7,466 名年龄在 44 至 66 岁的美国成年人进行平均 14.7 年追踪的研究显示，*患有"严重牙周炎"的人, 比"没有或轻度牙周炎"的人, 患癌症的风险更大。*


But correlation is not the same as cause and effect, and scientists have not nailed down the exact relationship between periodontitis, which affects more than 11 percent of the global population, and various systemic diseases.

[.my2]
**但"相关性"并不等同于"因果关系"，科学家们还没有确定"牙周炎"与各种全身性疾病之间的确切关系，**牙周炎影响着全球超过 11% 的人口。


Flipping the question on its head, does preventing or treating periodontal disease help to prevent heart problems? For example, a study that tracked the health habits of 11,869 adults 35 and older in Scotland found that within eight years, those who rarely brushed their teeth had more cardiovascular problems compared with those who brushed twice a day.

[.my2]
反过来问，预防或治疗牙周病, 是否有助于预防心脏问题？例如，一项追踪苏格兰 11,869 名 35 岁及以上成年人健康习惯的研究发现，*八年内，很少刷牙的人, 比每天刷牙两次的人, 更容易出现心血管问题。*


That still does not prove that preventing periodontitis will hold heart problems at bay: Some other habit or feature of the toothbrushing group could have been the important factor. The relationship is difficult to tease out, Barrow says, because people who are taking good care of their mouths tend to take good care of themselves in general.

[.my2]
**这仍然不能证明预防"牙周炎"就能避免心脏问题：刷牙人群的其他一些习惯或特征, 可能是重要因素(即存在的第三方变量, 可能才是真正的原因)。**巴罗说，*这种关系很难弄清楚，因为照顾好自己的口腔的人, 通常也会照顾好自己(的健康)。*
