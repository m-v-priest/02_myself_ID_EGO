== 如何让你对自己选择更满意

Decisions can be hard. We may be haunted (表情)焦虑的,忧心忡忡的,闹鬼的 by the path (not taken).

But the best way to feel better about the one choice we do make /may be *to put up a literal 字面上的,原义的,确确实实的 barrier 障碍 to* any of the other choices.

In a recent study, some participants had to choose a chocolate from a box /holding a selection of 24 chocolates. Others picked from a box /containing just six chocolates. Each box had a transparent lid 盖子. Some were told /to just pick one and taste it. Others had to pick one, but close the lid again before tasting it. Then all participants were asked to rate 评级 their chocolate.

Those /who [underline]#put# a transparent lid [underline]#back# on the box immediately /after choosing from the 24 chocolates /enjoyed their candy /more than those who lingered 继续存留,留恋；不愿离开 with the lid open — even though both groups could see the chocolates not chosen!

What about the six-chocolate box? Closing the lid *had no effect on* chocolate rankings. The study is the Journal of Consumer Research.

The researchers say /other studies show that /when we start with fewer options /we don't tend to *ruminate (v.) on* 沉思;琢磨;认真考虑 other choices, or even compare 对比 options. We simply like what we get.

Just don't put back any *half eaten* chocolates.

====
.ruminate
/ˈruːmɪ-neɪt/ (v.)( formal ) [ VV speech] ~ (on/over/about sth) to think deeply about sth 沉思；认真思考 +
-> rumin,瘤胃，反刍动物的第一个胃，-ate,使。引申词义沉思，思考，比喻用法。

做选择并不容易, 尤其是选择太多时.

试验:
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|甲盒子中(盒子有透明盖子), 有24种巧克力
|乙盒子中(盒子有透明盖子), 有6种巧克力

|- A组人: 选一块巧克力, *在盖子开着的情况下*, 吃巧克力.
- B组人: 选一块巧克力, *把盖子盖上后*, 再吃巧克力. -> 报告说, 比A组人更喜欢他们选的巧克力.
|- A组人 和 B组人, 对巧克力的评价没有区别.
|===

结论就是: 当你只有较少的选择时, 你就不太会去纠结你没选的那些东西. 也不太会去进行更多比较. 这样, 你就更容易对自己所得到的东西感到满意.
