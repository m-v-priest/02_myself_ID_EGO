== Why Do Airplane Flights Cause Digestive Problems? 为什么坐飞机会导致消化问题？ +

If you get an upset, gassy stomach while traveling on planes, you’re not alone. +
如果您在乘坐飞机时感到胃部不适、胀气，那么您并不孤单。 +

The average person passes gas 12 to 25 times a day, but when you’re on a plane, you might feel like you’re constantly breaking wind. +
一般人每天放屁12到25次，但当你在飞机上时，你可能会觉得你一直在放屁。 +

In addition to feeling gassy, some may experience an increase in other stomach issues during air travel. +
除了感到胀气外，有些人在航空旅行期间还可能会出现其他胃部问题。 +

Though scientists have yet to directly measure digestive changes in people traveling on commercial passenger airlines, high-altitude research has revealed some clues to what’s happening in the gut when you’re in flight. +
尽管科学家尚未直接测量乘坐商业客运航班的人的消化变化，但高海拔研究已经揭示了一些关于飞行时肠道发生变化的线索。 +

As you ascend to higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure decreases. +
当你上升到更高的高度时，大气压力会降低。 +

This change in pressure makes the air feel thinner because there’s less oxygen. +
这种压力变化使空气感觉更稀薄，因为氧气更少。 +

Low air pressure and cold temperatures at these elevations cause the air to expand, spreading out molecules such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon, all necessary components of air. +
这些海拔地区的低气压和寒冷温度导致空气膨胀，扩散出氧、氮和氩等分子，这些都是空气的必要成分。 +

When the blood doesn’t carry sufficient oxygen to tissues, it causes hypoxia. +
当血液不能将足够的氧气输送到组织时，就会导致缺氧。 +

A reduced oxygen level in the body slows down the activity of digestive enzymes, which may contribute to problems with digestion. +
体内氧气水平降低会减慢消化酶的活性，这可能会导致消化问题。 +

Research on hypoxia has also indicated several other gastrointestinal (GI) changes, from an upset stomach to more severe issues, such as bleeding in the bowels. +
对缺氧的研究还表明了其他几种胃肠道（GI）变化，从胃部不适到更严重的问题，例如肠道出血。 +

Fortunately, traveling in a plane isn’t the same as climbing to the top of Mount Everest, which stands at a lofty height of 29,029 feet. +
幸运的是，乘坐飞机旅行与攀登海拔 29,029 英尺的珠穆朗玛峰并不相同。 +

Though commercial airplanes soar a bit higher at an altitude between 31,000 and 42,000 feet, they contain cabin-pressure-control systems in which conditioned air simulates a pressure akin to that at 8,000 feet of altitude. +
尽管商用飞机在 31,000 至 42,000 英尺之间的高度飞行得更高一些，但它们配备了机舱压力控制系统，其中空调空气模拟的压力类似于 8,000 英尺高度的压力。 +

That change in cabin pressure can still make gas in your gut expand if you have food in your stomach. +
如果您胃里有食物，机舱压力的变化仍然会使您肠道内的气体膨胀。 +

Changes in cabin pressure and oxygen saturation, along with the vibration and motion of the plane, can inhibit gastric emptying. +
机舱压力和氧饱和度的变化以及飞机的振动和运动会抑制胃排空。 +

In other words, digested food can’t move to the small intestine, making it more difficult to do a number two. +
换句话说，消化后的食物无法移动到小肠，这使得第二步变得更加困难。 +

This can contribute to feeling bloated, gassy and nauseated. +
这可能会导致腹胀、胀气和恶心的感觉。 +
 +
The length of your flight matters as well. +
您的飞行时间也很重要。 +

A one-hour flight won’t disrupt your gut as much as a 14-hour trip will. +
1 小时的飞行不会像 14 小时的旅行那样对您的肠道造成太大影响。 +

Spending most of your time sitting in a cramped seat can compress the abdomen and make it harder for food to pass through. +
大部分时间坐在狭窄的座位上会压迫腹部，使食物更难通过。 +

Even if you maintain a good posture, sitting for long periods of time makes it harder for the expanded gas in the GI tract to escape. +
即使你保持良好的姿势，长时间坐着也会使胃肠道中膨胀的气体更难逸出。 +

Being less active slows down your intestinal motility, thereby exacerbating bloating and constipation. +
活动量减少会减慢肠道蠕动，从而加剧腹胀和便秘。 +

Additionally, if you have heavy foods in your stomach, this could be problematic if the plane runs into any turbulence. +
此外，如果你的胃里有太多食物，当飞机遇到湍流时，这可能会出现问题。 +

a bumpy ride could lead to nausea and vomiting for people prone to motion sickness. +
对于容易晕车的人来说，颠簸的旅程可能会导致恶心和呕吐。 +

Stress might also be a culprit in a gassy airborne stomach. +
压力也可能是胃胀气的罪魁祸首。 +

Research has shown that the gut has a close relationship with the brain: people with flight anxiety release the stress hormone cortisol, which reduces blood flow and oxygen to the digestive system. +
研究表明，肠道与大脑有着密切的关系：患有飞行焦虑症的人会释放应激激素皮质醇，从而减少消化系统的血流量和氧气。 +

The decreased blood flow, in turn, slows down the digestive system. +
血流量减少反过来又会减慢消化系统的速度。 +

For many people with anxiety, getting on a plane and flying for long periods stimulates symptoms of bloating, cramping in their abdomen and the butterflies-in-their-stomach feeling. +
对于许多患有焦虑症的人来说，乘坐飞机和长时间飞行会刺激腹胀、腹部绞痛和胃部不适的症状。 +

If you’re someone with a preexisting GI condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastroenterologists warn that flying can worsen your symptoms. +
如果您患有肠易激综合征 (IBS) 或炎症性肠病 (IBD) 等胃肠道疾病，胃肠病学家警告说，乘坐飞机可能会使您的症状恶化。 +

Bedford says people with Crohn’s disease, a type of IBD, may have episodes of diarrhea, while people with IBS, a noninflammatory condition that causes abdominal discomfort and altered bowel movements, report frequent bloating, diarrhea and constipation. +
贝德福德说，患有克罗恩病（炎症性肠病的一种）的人可能会出现腹泻，而患有肠易激综合征（一种导致腹部不适和排便改变的非炎症性疾病）的人会经常出现腹胀、腹泻和便秘。 +

The increase in symptoms is not typically caused by the flight itself but by the anxiety of flying. +
症状的增加通常不是由飞行本身引起的，而是由飞行的焦虑引起的。 +

Flight anxiety and underlying stress from delays or unexpected changes to travel plans may cause many people’s IBS to flare up, he says. +
他说，飞行焦虑以及旅行计划延误或意外变化带来的潜在压力可能会导致许多人的肠易激综合症发作。 +

The good news is you can take steps to prevent tummy troubles on your next flight. +
好消息是，您可以采取措施预防下次飞行时出现肚子问题。 +

Gut experts recommend drinking a lot of water. +
肠道专家建议多喝水。 +

When you’re traveling, you’re usually not drinking as much, so you’re becoming dehydrated. +
当你旅行时，你通常不会喝那么多水，所以你会脱水。 +

The dry air and low air pressure in long flights is dehydrating. +
长途飞行中的干燥空气和低气压会让人脱水。 +

Dehydration due to low humidity levels in the cabin can slow down digestion and worsen constipation and preexisting IBS symptoms. +
机舱内低湿度导致的脱水会减慢消化速度，加重便秘和已有的肠易激综合症症状。 +

If you are eating before your flight, opt for a light meal that’s gentle on the stomach. +
如果您在航班起飞前吃东西，请选择对肠胃温和的便餐。 +

This includes lean proteins and foods rich in fiber and healthy fats, such as salmon and Greek yogurt with berries. +
这包括瘦肉蛋白和富含纤维和健康脂肪的食物，例如鲑鱼和带有浆果的希腊酸奶。 +

"You don’t really want to have processed foods or salty foods before getting on a flight,” Bedford says. +
“在登机前，你真的不想吃加工食品或咸味食品，”贝德福德说。 +

He also encourages people to not eat at least 30 minutes before the flight. +
他还鼓励人们在航班起飞前至少 30 分钟不要进食。 +

Eating earlier can help your stomach digest the food before boarding. +
早点吃饭可以帮助胃在登机前消化食物。 +

Once on the plane, you’re better off skipping the wine, coffee or carbonated drinks, which might worsen an already upset stomach. +
一旦上了飞机，你最好不要喝葡萄酒、咖啡或碳酸饮料，这可能会加剧已经不舒服的胃部不适。 +

Surapaneni also advises to stay mobile when it’s safe to do so, whether that’s by standing up to take a stretch or walking around the cabin. +
苏拉帕尼尼还建议在安全的情况下保持活动，无论是站起来伸展身体还是在机舱​​内走动。 +
 +

If you have a GI condition or are nervous about an upcoming flight, it’s always a good idea to consult with your doctor before boarding in case there are other remedies they would recommend. +
如果您患有胃肠道疾病或对即将到来的航班感到紧张，最好在登机前咨询您的医生，以防他们推荐其他治疗方法。 +

Also, don’t fret if you continue feeling some digestive issues after landing. +
另外，如果您在着陆后仍然感到消化问题，请不要担心。 +

These symptoms are temporary and usually pass in 24 to 48 hours, Bedford says. +
Bedford 说，这些症状是暂时的，通常会在 24 至 48 小时内消失。 +
 +

So the next time you’re on a plane, if you’re a little gassier than usual, it’s better to release it rather than attempt to hold it in for an entire flight. +
因此，下次您乘坐飞机时，如果您比平时稍微有点气，最好将其释放出来，而不是在整个飞行过程中试图将其憋住。 +

Move around and let it rip—hopefully not sitting next to somebody, if you can avoid it. +
四处走动，让它撕裂——如果你能避免的话，希望不要坐在某人旁边。
