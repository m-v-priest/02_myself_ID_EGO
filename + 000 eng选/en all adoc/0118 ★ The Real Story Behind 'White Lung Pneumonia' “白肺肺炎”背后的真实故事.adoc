== The Real Story Behind 'White Lung Pneumonia'

Separate outbreaks of pneumonia in children have cropped up in the U.S., China and Europe. Public health experts say the uptick in cases is not caused by a novel pathogen

Colored scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a dendritic cell infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae (yellow). Mycoplasmas are bacteria that lack a cell wall. Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis.

Many pathogens that circulate in the Northern Hemisphere’s winter and year-round—including flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and now COVID—are far from benign and can lead to pneumonia in some cases.

These are just everyday pathogens that normally increase during the winter having a somewhat early and very assertive increase at the present time.

But people are not helpless against these germs, COVID, the flu and RSV all have vaccines that can reduce the risk of pneumonia.

Earlier in November China had reported an increase in respiratory disease cases. Chinese health officials attributed this uptick to the lift of COVID restrictions and the usual rise in known pathogens that can also make people vulnerable to pneumonia, including flu, COVID, RSV and infections caused by the common bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

What’s causing the current uptick in pneumonia cases, and how severe are they?

the biggest cause is likely that pathogens have more opportunity to spread in the winter.

These viruses are taking advantage of us now that we are close together in birthday parties, schools, travel, religious services—whatever brings people together indoors.

The New Year’s parties, all the travel associated with that and vacations are all wonderful environments that predispose to the spread of all of these respiratory infections, some of which will eventuate in pneumonia.


What is the difference between pneumonia, “walking pneumonia” and “white lung syndrome”?

Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs that can be caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria and fungi. Most respiratory infections involve the upper respiratory tract—the nose, throat and upper bronchial tubes.

An infection develops into pneumonia when it reaches the lower respiratory tract and invades the lung tissue. This causes the lung’s white blood cells to trigger an inflammatory response. If you get a lot of pneumonia, it will materially interfere with your ability to exchange gases. You can get short of breath, and you can have difficulty breathing.

Other symptoms include cough, fever, chest pain, fatigue and loss of appetite.


At least a dozen different pathogens can lead to pneumonia—no individual pathogen is responsible for even one in 10 cases. In fact, the pathogen behind any particular case of pneumonia is often never identified. Most pneumonia cases are triggered by a bacterium, but pneumonia is also a possible complication of respiratory viruses, such as COVID, influenza, RSV and even the common cold. These viruses can cause pneumonia by themselves or by making the body more vulnerable to secondary infections.

Once somebody is infected with a virus, they’re more prone to get a bacterial infection on top of that” because the viral infection reduces their immune defenses.

The people that are affected are very young—infants and very young children—and very old and people with chronic illness.

"Walking pneumonia" is a lay term often used to describe mild pneumonia cases, particularly those caused by Mycoplasma bacteria. It also has been called atypical pneumonia and can cause fevers, a dry cough and sometimes ear infections.

“walking pneumonia” is usually not that severe. Although we treat it with antibiotics, it usually is, for the most part, limited.

“White lung disease,” or “white lung syndrome,” is nothing but a scary lay description, not used by medical professionals, of what we see on a routine chest x-ray. Healthy lungs full of air appear black in an x-ray because air looks dark in a normal reading. When inflammation and white blood cells fill the area, the lungs become opaque and more white on the reading. It’s neither a scientific nor a medically acceptable term.

How does pneumonia differ between children and adults?

Pneumonia symptoms are similar in children and adults, though young children may also experience nausea and vomiting, and older adults may have confusion. Beyond that, different bugs are more apt to produce pneumonia in children than adults. The older you get, if you have underlying illnesses, these respiratory viruses are more likely to result in pneumonia.


Older adults tend to fare worse with pneumonia. Though pneumonia is the number-one cause of hospitalization in children in the U.S., older adults hospitalized with the disease have a greater risk of death than those hospitalized for any of the other top-10 reasons. That’s why it’s particularly important for older adults to get their RSV, flu and COVID vaccines.

The populations who are at higher risk for complications, hospitalizations and dying from respiratory viruses and bacteria are the same populations who will benefit most from these vaccinations.

How is pneumonia treated?

Most viral pneumonia can only be treated with supportive care, such as providing oxygen; people with severe cases may require ventilators, heart-lung machines and other forms of mechanical ventilation. Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics.

If you are otherwise healthy, there’s no need to contact a health care provider in the first several days of developing a respiratory infection. But if you develop warning symptoms, such as confusion, shortness of breath or a fever that lasts more than three or four days, it’s prudent to call your health care provider or seek emergency care.


Antivirals for flu and COVID, such as Paxlovid, can reduce the likelihood of developing pneumonia when taken early in the course of illness. Those in high-risk groups who develop respiratory symptoms, including those who have a chronic illness or are immunocompromised, should call their health care provider even when the symptoms seem mild. That way they can get tested for flu and COVID to see if they potentially qualify for medications that reduce the severity of those diseases. Diagnosing an infection and treating it early are key to stopping it from turning into pneumonia.


How can you prevent pneumonia?

Though vaccination can’t prevent all cases of pneumonia, five vaccines recommended in the U.S. can substantially reduce risk of it. Two of these are already routinely recommended for children: the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15 and PCV20) and the Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) vaccine. Pneumococcal vaccines are also recommended in adults aged 65 and older, as well as adults with certain medical conditions.

The COVID and seasonal flu vaccines, recommended for everyone aged six months and older, greatly reduce the risk of those diseases developing into pneumonia. Protection against RSV by the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab (Beyfortus) and the recently approved RSV vaccines can also reduce pneumonia risk in those eligible, including adults aged 60 and older, babies and some toddlers.

(Pneumonia develops in one out of five cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, so pertussis vaccination can also prevent pneumonia.)

The same behaviors recommended to prevent the spread of COVID, such as masking, staying home when sick and social distancing, will also reduce risk of other respiratory illnesses that can cause pneumonia.

Thyagarajan says she wears her mask at large gatherings in the winter season to protect herself and to protect others as well. That’s especially important if you are a caregiver for an older person or young baby.

Avoiding people who are coughing and showing other symptoms is obviously ideal, too, but it can be difficult to do. Stay home if you are sick—it’s ultimately one of the best ways to avoid spreading illness.
