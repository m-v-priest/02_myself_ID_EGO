== How to reveal a country’s sense, over the years, of its own well-being

如何揭示一个国家多年来对自身福祉的感受


Overall, then, Dr Sgroi and Dr Proto found that /happiness *does vary (v.)（根据情况）变化，变更，改变  with* GDP.

[.my2]
总体而言，斯格罗伊和普罗图发现, 幸福感确实会随GDP的变化而改变。


But 主 the effect of health and *life expectancy*, which does not *have the episodic (a.)偶尔发生的；不定期的 quality* 质量；品质 of *booms （贸易和经济活动的）激增，繁荣 , busts (n.)打破；摔碎,突袭,经济萧条时期  and armed conflict*, 系 is larger, even 主 when *the tendency of* wealth to improve health 谓 *is taken into account*.

[.my2]
"健康"和"预期寿命"的影响, 不像"繁荣、萧条"和"武装冲突"那样断断续续，但它们的影响更大，即使把"财富改善了健康"的趋势考虑在内。

主 A one-year increase in longevity 长寿；长命；持久, for example, 谓 *has the same effect* on national happiness /*as* 如同，像……一样 a 4.3% increase in GDP.

[.my2]
例如，寿命延长一年，对国民幸福感的影响, 与GDP增长4.3％的影响相同。


And, *as* the grand historical sweep 巡行；搜索；扫荡 *suggests*, 强调句 it is warfare 战争 /*that causes (v.) the biggest drops* in happiness. [On average] it takes a 30% increase in GDP /*to raise happiness* /by the amount 后定 that a year of war causes (v.) it to fall.

[.my2]
而且，正如对漫长历史的探究所显示的那样，战争导致幸福感下降最多。平均而言，一年的战争所导致的幸福感降幅, 需要GDP增长30%才能拉平。

*The upshot 最后结果；结局 appears to be that*, while 虽然；尽管 despite the fact that…​ 虽然；尽管 主 increasing national income 系 is important to happiness, *it is not as important as* ① ensuring the population is healthy ② *and* avoiding conflict.

[.my2]
结果似乎是，虽然"增加国民收入"对提升幸福感很重要，但"确保人口健康"和"避免冲突"的作用更大。

== <pure> How to reveal a country’s sense, over the years, of its own well-being


Overall, then, Dr Sgroi and Dr Proto found that {happiness does vary with GDP}. But  the effect of health and life expectancy, which does not have the episodic quality of booms, busts and armed conflict, is larger, even when  the tendency of wealth to improve health is taken into account.  A one-year increase in longevity, for example,  has [underline]#the same# effect on national happiness [underline]#as# a 4.3% increase in GDP. And, as the grand historical sweep suggests, it is warfare that causes the biggest drops in happiness. [On average] it takes a 30% increase in GDP to raise happiness by the amount (that a year of war causes it to fall). The upshot appears to be that, while increasing national income is important to happiness, it is not as important as ensuring the population is healthy and avoiding conflict.
