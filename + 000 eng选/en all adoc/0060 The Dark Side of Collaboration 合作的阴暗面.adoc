在一起工作的人往往会把"利益"放在比"说真话"更高的位置上。新的研究指出了阻止这种行为的方法.

对协作的讨论, 常常强调它的优势：例如，它可以帮助人们解决他们无法单独解决的复杂问题。但在某些情况下，团队合作可能成为滋生不诚实行为的温床。

我和我的同事汇集了过去许多研究的数据，以了解形成和构成群体不诚实行为的力量。我们分析了 34 个研究项目，共涉及 10,000 多名参与者。在这些实验中，科学家要求人们作为团队的一员, 玩经济游戏或执行决策任务。每个研究的具体指示各不相同，但在所有实验中，参与者都可以通过诚实和团队合作来获得金钱。

然而，作为一个群体，他们也有机会通过撒谎来赚取额外的钱。例如，在某些任务中，团队根据他们一起解决的谜题数量获得奖励;参与者可以撒谎, 并夸大他们破译的数量。在所有的研究和任务中，我们发现群体倾向于撒谎。平均而言，他们获得的额外利润, 比他们简单地说实话所能获得的利润, 高出35.6%。

我们还表明，合谋的不诚实是具有传染性并且会逐渐升级。我们分析了几项研究，其中涉及要求一对人在多轮中掷骰子。一人在私下中掷骰子，然后报告结果。他们的伴侣会了解这个报告，然后掷一枚独立的骰子，并报告自己的结果。如果两个队友声称他们掷得相同的数字，他们将得到奖金：例如，两个一意味着每个人得到1美元，两个二意味着每个人得到2美元，以此类推。一对人可以选择诚实，只有在他们真正掷得相同数字时才能获得报酬。但是在许多轮次中，有些人可能会被诱使报告更高的数字或相同的数字，以获取更高或更频繁的奖金。

对于这些研究，我们首先确定是否有参与者明显撒谎。当数据显示某些人在任务的所有轮次中只报告六点（最高点数）或只报告双数时，我们将这些不太可能的幸运掷骰者, 标记为厚颜无耻的撒谎者。（因为在任务中最常见的20轮次中, 获得六点或双数的机会非常小，小于0.001％，所以我们对这个分类感到有信心。）

好消息是, 欺骗是有限度的。例如，在拼图任务中，大多数团队并没有假装解决所有呈现的拼图。当研究增加不诚实的道德成本时，例如通过告知人们 说谎会伤害其他参与者, 或对慈善捐赠产生负面影响，团体说谎的次数就会减少。最重要的是，我们发现, 小组成员的性别和年龄很重要。一个团体中的女性越多，成员年龄越大，该团体撒谎的次数就越少。我们仍在调查这种模式的原因。

它和curve（曲线）都来自拉丁语curvare（使弯曲）。“勒马绳”和“弯曲”有何关系呢？在马前进时，马脖子向前挺直，你要左转，得用绳子将马脖子拽向左边，即向左弯曲；让马停下得往后拽绳，使脖子向后弯曲。

我们的研究结果, 指出了人们在团队合作时, 可以鼓励诚实的具体方式。例如，我们发现, 协作不诚实具有传染性，这表明人们应该尝试发现早期迹象, 并采取行动。管理人员可以对哪怕是很小的欺骗行为实施零容忍政策，以阻止其蔓延。为了增加对不诚实行为的早期披露，他们可以制定政策，在举报人举报不诚实行为时，原谅他们在不当行为中所扮演的角色。而且，因为当一个群体相信"别人会被自己的谎言伤害"时，他们会更诚实，所以更突出地强调不诚实的负面后果, 可能有助于遏制这种情况。

== The Dark Side of Collaboration



People working together often scheme to put profits ahead of telling the truth. New research points to ways to stop this behavior.


Often discussion of collaboration emphasizes its advantages: it helps people solve complex problems they could not address alone, for instance. But there are also situations in which group work can be fertile ground for dishonest behavior.


My colleagues and I pooled data from many past studies to understand the forces that shape and underlie group dishonesty. We analyzed 34 research projects that involved more than 10,000 participants altogether. In these experiments, scientists asked people to play economic games or carry out decision-making tasks while part of a team. The specific instructions varied from one study to the next, but across experiments, participants could gain money through honesty and teamwork.

They also had opportunities, however, to earn additional money as a group by lying. For example, in some tasks, teams received a payout based on the number of puzzles they solved together; participants could lie and inflate the quantity they had deciphered. Across all studies and tasks, we found that groups tended to lie. On average, they earned 35.6 percent of the extra profits available to them above what they could make from simply telling the truth.

We also showed that collaborative dishonesty is contagious and escalates. Several studies we analyzed involved asking pairs of people to roll dice over multiple rounds. One person rolled a die in private and then reported the outcome. Their partner learned about that report and then rolled an independent die before reporting their own outcome. If both teammates claimed to have rolled the same number, they received a payout: for example, a one-one double might mean each person got $1, a two-two double could mean $2 each, and so on. Pairs could choose to be honest and receive payment only when they truly rolled doubles. But over the course of many rounds, some pairs would be tempted to falsely declare a higher or matching roll for greater or more frequent payouts.


For these studies, we first identified whether any participants were obviously deceitful. When the data suggested that certain people reported only sixes—the highest roll possible—or only doubles in all rounds of the task, we labeled these improbably lucky rollers as brazen liars. (Because the chance of getting sixes or doubles in 20 rounds, the most common number of rounds in the task, is very small—less than 0.001 percent—we felt confident about this classification.)

The brazen liar’s behavior influenced their partner. People were more likely to lie when their partner did. This dishonesty also grew over time. In later rounds, compared with earlier ones, the first person to roll a die was more likely to report a higher roll, and their partner was more likely to report a double.


The good news is that there was a limit to the deceit. In puzzle tasks, for instance, most teams did not pretend to solve every puzzle presented. And when studies added ethical costs for dishonesty, such as by informing people that lies would harm other participants or have negative consequences for a charity donation, groups lied less. On top of that, we discovered that the gender and age of the group members mattered. The more women a group had and the older its members were, the less the group lied. We are still investigating reasons for this pattern.


Our findings point to specific ways people could encourage honesty when groups work together. For instance, our discovery that collaborative dishonesty is contagious suggests that people should try to detect and act on early signs. Managers could implement zero-tolerance policies toward even small acts of deceit to deter its spread. To increase early disclosure of dishonesty, they could put policies in place that forgive whistleblowers for their part in wrongdoing when they come forward about dishonest deeds. And because groups are more honest when they believe others are harmed by their lies, highlighting the negative consequences of dishonesty more prominently may help curb it.
