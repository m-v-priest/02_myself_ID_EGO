== Is ‘Bed Rotting’ Good or Bad for Your Sleep? “躺床摆烂”对你的睡眠有好处还是坏处？

“Bed rotting,” or staying in bed all day, has been touted as a self-care routine on TikTok, but it might actually make you feel worse. Here’s why that happens and how you can snap out of it

“躺床摆烂”，即整天躺在床上，在 TikTok 上被宣传为一种自我护理习惯，但实际上它可能会让你感觉更糟。这就是为什么会发生这种情况以及如何摆脱它



“There’s so many problems, when it comes to bed rotting, for sleep,” says Fiona Barwick, a clinical associate professor and associate division chief of behavioral sleep medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.

斯坦福大学医学院临床副教授兼行为睡眠医学副主任菲奥娜·巴威克 (Fiona Barwick) 表示：“躺床摆烂对睡眠来说存在很多问题。”

Bed rotting appears to affect three important elements of sleep health, Barwick says. First, she points to the circadian rhythm, our internal clock that’s tuned to light and dark and regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Some people participating in the trend may stay in bed all day, perhaps without catching a glimpse of light except the glow of a screen. Receiving no light early in the day followed by getting copious light toward the evening (by switching on all the lights, for example) can scramble this internal clock, which runs close to a 24-hour cycle in most people.

躺床摆烂似乎会影响睡眠健康的三个重要因素。首先，她指出了**昼夜节律，即我们的内部时钟，它会调节光明和黑暗并调节睡眠-觉醒周期。**一些参与躺床摆烂这一趋势的人可能会整天躺在床上，除了屏幕的发光之外，也许看不到任何光。**白天早些时候没有接受光照，然后在晚上接受充足的光照（例如，打开所有的灯）可能会扰乱体内的生物钟，**而对于大多数人来说，生物钟的运行周期接近 24 小时。

“Light tends to suppress and delay melatonin,” the sleep-inducing hormone released by the pineal gland in our brain. “If you’re rotting in bed, and you don’t get light until the afternoon, you haven’t gotten that circadian morning light signal that sets the timing for your sleep the next night.”

“*光往往会抑制和延迟"褪黑激素"的产生，”"褪黑激素"是我们大脑中"松果体"释放的睡眠诱导激素。* “如果你躺在床上，直到下午才得到光照，那么你就没有收到昼夜节律的晨光信号，从而设定你第二天晚上的睡眠时间。”


Using your bed as a place to spend time awake also influences the third aspect: sleep cues, a major part of sleep hygiene. These cues are the mental associations you form between sleep and certain times, places (such as your bed) and even sensory inputs such as scents. “Making sure your bed is strongly, clearly associated with sleep and not wakeful activities is one of the evidence-based techniques for better sleep,” Barwick says. If you spend a day in bed on TikTok, then “the bed-and-sleep cue will be weak, which will not help sleep.”

**将床作为醒着的地方(即老躺在床上), 也会影响第三个方面：睡眠线索，**这是睡眠卫生的重要组成部分。**这些线索, 是您在睡眠与特定时间、地点（例如您的床）甚至气味等感官输入之间, 形成的心理关联。**巴威克说：“*确保你的床与"睡眠"而不是"清醒活动"产生联系，是改善睡眠的循证技术之一。*”如果你在床上躺了一天来刷手机上TikTok ，那么“(你的)睡觉提示就会很弱，这无助于睡眠。”


Periods longer or more frequent, however, may cause some backlash in the form of fatigue, a dysregulated internal clock and higher levels of stress from facing duties we have only temporarily escaped.

*"躺床摆烂"更长或更频繁的频率, 可能会导致疲劳、生物钟失调, 以及因"面对我们暂时逃避的职责, 而产生了的更大压力(逃得了初一, 逃不了十五. 即拖延症带来的更大压力)"。*

Excess time in bed can also weigh on mental health and affect sleep that way. Sleep and psychiatric symptoms have a “bidirectional” relationship. For example, depression might increase fatigue, but sleeping more to relieve that fatigue may also exacerbate depression symptoms. “We demonstrate that poor sleep can actually worsen depression if you don’t get sufficient sleep.”

**卧床时间过长, 也会影响心理健康, **并影响睡眠。他解释说，睡眠和精神症状具有“双向”关系。例如，*抑郁可能会增加疲劳，但通过增加睡眠来缓解疲劳, 也可能会加剧抑郁症状。* “我们证明，如果睡眠不足，*睡眠不足实际上会加剧抑郁症.*”
