在习近平成为中国领导人的前一年，北京大学(Peking University) 47岁的教授张千帆, 在纪念中国最后一个封建王朝1911年覆灭100周年的演讲中，描绘了自那以来, 中国在向民众灌输尊重宪法原则方面所做的努力的历史。挤得水泄不通的大讲堂里，学生们肩并肩地站在墙边。在学生们的微笑与鼓掌声中, 张千帆说:“我已经写下了我的真实感受……它们可能听起来带有强烈的个人情感。如果冒犯了你，请原谅我。”

== <pure> China tries to stop academics from taking its constitution literally


A YEAR BEFORE Xi Jinping became China’s leader, a 47-year-old professor at Peking University, Zhang Qianfan, delivered a talk to mark the 100th anniversary of the collapse of China’s last imperial dynasty, in 1911, charting the history of efforts since then to instil respect for constitutional principles. Students unable to find seats in the packed lecture theatre stood shoulder-to-shoulder around the walls. They grinned and clapped when he started by saying: “I have written down my true feelings… They may sound fierce. Forgive me if they cause offence.”

The thin, bespectacled academic held his audience spellbound. Those who, unable to find space in the room, had crowded by the doorway, were still there when he finished, almost two hours later. That was fortunate, because his final point was the most powerful in a lecture packed with indictments of China’s failure to implement the guarantees of its constitution, including freedom of speech, of assembly and of association. Mr Zhang wrapped up by listing 12 places where authoritarian rule had (at least briefly) crumbled, from the Soviet Union to Taiwan to countries that had recently experienced the Arab spring. “What their people can do,” he said, “the Chinese” — and here he paused briefly while the audience began to laugh and clap --“people can certainly do.” Wild applause ensued. Someone cried, “Good!”


But he kept his job. And remarkably his textbook, “An Introduction to the Study of Constitutional Law”, first published in 2004, was republished in 2014 by Law Press, which is controlled by the Ministry of Justice. The preface sets the tone: “The study of constitutional law must break down forbidden ideological zones, because the rights of Chinese citizens accept no forbidden zones.”
