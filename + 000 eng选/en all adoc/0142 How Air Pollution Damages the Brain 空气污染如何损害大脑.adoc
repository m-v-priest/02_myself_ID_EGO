== How Air Pollution Damages the Brain 空气污染如何损害大脑


By 1992, burgeoning population, choking traffic, and explosive industrial growth in Mexico City had caused the United Nations to label it the most polluted urban area in the world.
 In a series of elegant studies, the neuropathologist Lilian Calderón-Garcidueñas compared the brains of canines and children from “Makesicko City,” as the capital had been dubbed, to those from less polluted areas. What she found was terrifying: Exposure to air pollution in childhood decreases brain volume and heightens risk of several dreaded brain diseases, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, as an adult.

到 1992 年，墨西哥城人口激增、交通拥堵和工业爆炸式增长，导致联合国将其列为世界上污染最严重的城市地区。在一系列优雅的研究中，神经病理学家莉利安·卡尔德隆-加西杜尼亚斯将首都“马克西科市”的狗和儿童的大脑与来自污染较轻地区的狗和儿童的大脑进行了比较。她的发现令人恐惧：童年时期接触空气污染会减少大脑体积，并增加成年后患帕金森氏症和阿尔茨海默氏症等多种可怕脑部疾病的风险。

the damaged brains she documented through neuroimaging in young dogs and humans aren’t just significant in later years; they play out in impaired memory and lower intelligence scores throughout life. Other studies have found that air pollution exposure later in childhood alters neural circuitry throughout the brain, potentially affecting executive function, including abilities like decision-making and focus, and raising the risk of psychiatric disorders.

她通过神经影像学记录的幼犬和人类大脑受损不仅在以后的几年中很严重，而且在以后的岁月里也很严重。它们会导致一生的记忆力受损和智力得分较低。其他研究发现，儿童时期接触空气污染会改变整个大脑的神经回路，可能影响执行功能，包括决策和注意力等能力，并增加患精神疾病的风险。


According to the United Nations Foundation, “nearly half of the world’s population breathes toxic air each day, including more than 90 percent of children.” Some 2.3 billion people worldwide rely on solid fuels and open fires for cooking, the Foundation adds, making the problem far worse. The World Health Organization calculates about 3 million premature deaths, mostly in women and children, result from air pollution created by such cooking each year.

据联合国基金会称，“世界上近一半的人口每天呼吸有毒空气，其中包括 90% 以上的儿童。”该基金会补充说，全球约有 23 亿人依靠固体燃料和明火做饭，这使得问题更加严重。据世界卫生组织估计，每年约有 300 万人因此类烹饪造成的空气污染而过早死亡，其中大部分是妇女和儿童。


In the United States, meanwhile, average air pollution levels have decreased significantly since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. But the key word is average. Millions of Americans are still breathing outdoor air loaded with inflammation-triggering ozone and fine particulate matter. These particles, known as PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter), can affect the lungs and heart and are strongly associated with brain damage. Wildfires—like the ones that raged across Canada this past summer—are a major contributor of PM2.5. A recent study showed that pesticides, paints, cleaners, and other personal care products are another major—and under-recognized—source of PM2.5 and can raise the risk for numerous health problems, including brain-damaging strokes.

[.my2]
与此同时，在美国，自 1970 年《清洁空气法案》通过以来，平均空气污染水平已显着下降。但关键词是“平均”。数百万美国人仍然呼吸着含有引发炎症的臭氧和细颗粒物的室外空气。这些颗粒被称为 PM 2.5 （直径小于 2.5 微米的颗粒），会影响肺和心脏，并与脑损伤密切相关。野火（就像去年夏天在加拿大肆虐的野火一样）是 PM 2.5 的主要原因。最近的一项研究表明，杀虫剂、油漆、清洁剂和其他个人护理产品, 是 PM 2.5 的另一个主要且未被充分认识的来源，并且会增加许多健康问题的风险，包括"脑损伤性中风"。

What’s more, social disparities are at play: Poorer populations almost always live closer to factories, toxins, and pollutants.

[.my2]
更重要的是，社会差异也在发挥作用：较贫困的人口几乎总是住得离工厂、毒素和污染物更近。

“Over the past few years, we have found that higher levels of PM2.5 exposure are linked to a number of differences in the shape, neural architecture, and functional organization of the developing brain, including altered patterns of cortical thickness and differences in the microstructure of gray and white matter,” she says. On the basis of neuroimaging of exposed youngsters, Herting and fellow researchers suspect the widespread differences in brain structure and function linked with air pollution may be early biomarkers for cognitive and emotional problems emerging later in life.

[.my2]
“在过去的几年中，我们发现较高水平的 PM 2.5 暴露与发育中大脑的形状、神经结构和功能组织的许多差异有关，包括皮质模式的改变灰质和白质的厚度和微观结构的差异，”她说。根据对接触空气污染的青少年进行的神经影像学检查，赫廷和其他研究人员怀疑，与空气污染相关的大脑结构和功能的广泛差异可能是晚年出现的认知和情感问题的早期生物标志物。


That suspicion gains support from an international meta-analysis (a study of other studies) published in 2023 that correlated exposure to air pollution during critical periods of brain development in childhood and adolescence to risk of depression and suicidal behavior. The imaging parts of the studies showed changes in brain structure, including neurocircuitry potentially involved in movement disorders like Parkinson’s, and white matter of the prefrontal lobes, responsible for executive decision-making, attention, and self-control.

[.my2]
这一怀疑得到了 2023 年发表的一项国际荟萃分析（对其他研究的研究）的支持，该分析将儿童和青春期大脑发育关键时期接触空气污染, 与抑郁和自杀行为的风险, 联系起来。研究的成像部分, 显示了大脑结构的变化，包括可能与帕金森氏症等运动障碍有关的神经回路，以及负责执行决策、注意力和自我控制的前额叶白质。


In a 2023 study, Herting and colleagues tracked children transitioning into adolescence, when brains are in a sensitive period of development and thus especially vulnerable to long-term damage from toxins. Among brain regions developing during this period is the prefrontal cortex, which helps with cognitive control, self-regulation, decision-making, attention, and problem-solving, Herting says. “Your emotional reward systems are also still being refined,” she adds.

[.my2]
在 2023 年的一项研究中，赫廷和同事追踪了儿童进入青春期的过程，此时大脑正处于发育的敏感时期，因此特别容易受到毒素的长期损害。赫廷说，在此期间发育的大脑区域是前额叶皮层，它有助于认知控制、自我调节、决策、注意力和解决问题。 “你的情感奖励系统也仍在完善中，”她补充道。

Other research shows that air pollution increases risk of psychiatric disorder as years go by.  Bad air quality was associated with increased rates of bipolar disorder and depression in both countries, especially when exposure occurs early in life.

[.my2]
其他研究表明，随着时间的推移，空气污染会增加患精神疾病的风险。不良空气质量与这两个国家的双相情感障碍和抑郁症发病率增加有关，尤其是在生命早期接触空气质量时。


“It's possible that the same environment will cause disease in one person but not in another because of predisposing genetic variants that are different in different people. The different genetic predisposition, that’s one part of the puzzle. Another part is varying environment.”

[.my2]
“同样的环境可能会导致一个人患病，但不会导致另一个人患病，因为不同人的易感基因变异不同. 不同的遗传倾向，这是难题的一部分。另一部分是不同的环境。”



Indeed, these complex diseases are spreading much faster than genetics alone seems to explain. “We definitely don’t know for sure which pollutant is causal. We can’t really pinpoint a smoking gun,” Rzhetsky says. But one pesky culprit continues to prove statistically significant: “It looks like PM2.5 is one of those strong signals.” To figure it out specifically, we’ll need much more data, and exposomics will play a vital role.

[.my2]
事实上，这些复杂疾病的传播速度远远超出了仅用遗传学解释的速度。 “我们绝对不确定哪种污染物是造成这种情况的原因。我们无法真正确定确凿的证据，”Rzhetsky 说。但一个令人讨厌的罪魁祸首继续被证明具有统计意义：“看来 PM 2.5 是那些强烈信号之一。”为了具体弄清楚这一点，我们需要更多的数据，而暴露组学将发挥至关重要的作用。

Degenerative changes in neurons become increasingly frequent after the age of 60, yet half of the people who make it to 100 will not get dementia.

[.my2]
60岁以后，神经元的退行性变化变得越来越频繁，但活到100岁的人中有一半不会患痴呆症。

Not everyone reacts the same way when exposed to pollutants, of course. Greatest risk for Alzheimer’s seems to hit people who have a genetic variant known as apolipoprotein E (APOE4), which is involved in making proteins that help carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. About 25 percent of people have one copy of that gene, and 2 to 3 percent carry two copies. But inheriting the gene alone doesn’t determine a person’s Alzheimer’s risk. Environmental exposures count too.

[.my2]
当然，并不是每个人在接触污染物时都会有同样的反应。患阿尔茨海默氏症的最大风险似乎是那些携带载脂蛋白 E (APOE4) 基因变异的人，该基因参与制造有助于在血液中携带胆固醇和其他类型脂肪的蛋白质。大约 25% 的人携带该基因的一份拷贝，2% 至 3% 的人携带两份拷贝。但仅遗传该基因并不能决定一个人患阿尔茨海默病的风险。环境暴露也很重要。

A recent study by Chen, Finch, and colleagues published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease looked at associations between air pollution exposure and early signs of Alzheimer’s in 1,100 men, all around age 56 when the study began. By age 68, test subjects with high PM2.5 exposures had the worst scores in verbal fluency. People exposed to high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution were also linked to worsened episodic memory. The men who had APOE4 genes had the worst scores in executive function. The evidence indicates that the process by which air pollution interacts with genetic risk to cause Alzheimer’s in later life may begin in the middle years, at least for men.

[.my2]
Chen、Finch 及其同事最近在《阿尔茨海默病杂志》上发表了一项研究，研究了 1,100 名男性（研究开始时年龄在 56 岁左右）的空气污染暴露与阿尔茨海默病早期症状之间的关系。到 68 岁时，接触 PM 2.5 较多的测试对象在言语流畅性方面的得分最差。暴露于高浓度二氧化氮（NO 2 ）空气污染的人也与情景记忆恶化有关。携带 APOE4 基因的男性执行功能得分最差。有证据表明，空气污染与遗传风险相互作用，导致晚年患阿尔茨海默氏症的过程可能会在中年开始，至少对男性来说是这样。

A separate USC study of more than 2,000 women found that when air quality improved, cognitive decline in older women slowed. When exposure to pollutants like PM2.5 and NO2 dropped by a few micrograms per cubic foot a year over the course of six years, the women in the study tested as being a year or so younger than their real age. This suggests that when exposure air pollution is lowered, dementia risk can go down.

[.my2]
南加州大学对 2000 多名女性进行的另一项研究发现，当空气质量改善时，老年女性的认知能力下降速度会减慢。当接触到 PM 2.5 和 NO 2 等污染物的暴露量在六年内每年每立方英尺下降几微克时，参与研究的女性被测试为一年或一年比他们的实际年龄年轻。这表明，当接触空气污染减少时，痴呆症风险就会降低。

In parallel, an international study by the Lancet Commission concluded that the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer’s, can be lowered by modifying or avoiding 12 risk factors: hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, low social contact, low level of education, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury—and air pollution. Together, the 12 modifiable risk factors account for around 40 percent of worldwide dementias, which theoretically could be prevented or delayed.

[.my2]
与此同时，柳叶刀委员会的一项国际研究得出结论，可以通过改变或避免 12 种危险因素来降低痴呆症（包括阿尔茨海默病）的风险：高血压、听力障碍、吸烟、肥胖、抑郁、社交接触少、教育水平低、缺乏运动、糖尿病、过量饮酒、脑外伤以及空气污染。这 12 种可改变的风险因素加起来约占全球痴呆症的 40%，理论上可以预防或延缓痴呆症的发生。


Studies of Swedish twins show that half of individual differences in Alzheimer’s risk may be environmental, and thus modifiable; and while vast sums of research funding have been poured into the genetic roots of the disease, it could be that altering the exposome would provide a better preventive than all the ongoing drug trials to date. Environmental toxins broadly disrupt cell repair and protective mechanisms in the brain, the researchers point out. And factors like obesity and stress contribute to chronic inflammation, which likely damages neurons’ ability to function and communicate.

[.my2]
对瑞典双胞胎的研究表明，阿尔茨海默病风险的个体差异有一半可能是环境因素造成的，因此是可以改变的。尽管大量的研究资金投入到该疾病的遗传根源上，但改变暴露组可能会比迄今为止所有正在进行的药物试验提供更好的预防措施。研究人员指出，环境毒素广泛破坏大脑的细胞修复和保护机制。肥胖和压力等因素会导致慢性炎症，这可能会损害神经元的功能和交流能力。
