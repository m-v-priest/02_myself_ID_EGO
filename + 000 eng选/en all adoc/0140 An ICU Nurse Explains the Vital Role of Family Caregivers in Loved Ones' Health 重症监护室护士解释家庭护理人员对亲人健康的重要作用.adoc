== An ICU Nurse Explains the Vital Role of Family Caregivers in Loved Ones' Health 重症监护室护士解释家庭护理人员对亲人健康的重要作用

As a seasoned bedside critical care nurse, I see firsthand the benefits that family caregivers bring to patient care in the hospital. I also witness the emotional stress that caregivers experience when their loved one comes to the ICU.

[.my2]
作为一名经验丰富的床边重症监护护士，我亲眼目睹了家庭护理人员为医院患者护理带来的好处。我还亲眼目睹了护理人员在亲人来到重症监护室时, 所承受的情绪压力。

After years of helping families and physicians navigate the complicated course of an ICU hospital stay, I have some advice for caregivers to take with them.

[.my2]
经过多年帮助家人和医生度过 ICU 住院的复杂过程后，我向护理人员提出了一些建议。

==== CAREGIVERS OFTEN BATTLE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION

[.my2]
*照顾者经常与"焦虑"和"抑郁"作斗争*

From making medical decisions to advocating for their loved one, family caregivers have many important roles when their loved one is in the hospital. Their presence not only provides a sense of security, but also strongly influences a patient’s response to treatment.

[.my2]
*从做出医疗决定, 到为亲人辩护，当亲人住院时，家庭护理人员扮演着许多重要的角色。他们的存在不仅提供了安全感，而且还强烈影响患者对治疗的反应。*

Including the family in the patient’s treatment plan, also known as family-centered care, can help shorten a patient’s hospital stay and can even reduce hospital costs. However, caregivers carry heavy emotional burdens while supporting loved ones at the hospital.

[.my2]
**将家人纳入患者的治疗计划，也称为以家庭为中心的护理，可以帮助缩短患者的住院时间，甚至可以降低住院费用。**然而，护理人员在为医院的亲人提供支持时, 承受着沉重的情感负担。

In fact, family caregivers are at high risk of developing long-term psychological health problems. Up to 70% of first-degree relatives of ICU survivors suffer from anxiety symptoms, more than a third suffer from depression, and many can experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.

[.my2]
*事实上，家庭照顾者出现长期心理健康问题的风险很高。 ICU 幸存者的一级亲属中，多达 70% 患有"焦虑症状"，超过三分之一患有"抑郁症"，许多人可能会出现"创伤后应激障碍" (PTSD) 症状。*

There are ways to help ease this emotional burden, and most of them come down to consistent and open communication between the patient, their caregivers and the medical team.

[.my2]
*有很多方法可以帮助减轻这种情感负担，其中大多数都可以归结为: 患者、他们的护理人员, 和医疗团队之间, 持续和开放的沟通。*

But how should you, as the caregiver without much medical knowledge, communicate with hospital staff when your loved one can’t speak for themself?

[.my2]
但是，作为一个没有太多医学知识的看护者，当你的亲人无法自己说话时，你应该如何与医院工作人员沟通呢？

==== COMMUNICATION IS CRITICAL

[.my2]
沟通至关重要

First, exchange contact information with the primary medical team, which may include a passcode for patient privacy. This will ensure that you receive the most updated information about the patient and will give you the peace of mind knowing that you can call at any hour of the day or night to receive updates on your loved one.

[.my2]
首先，与"主要医疗团队"交换联系信息，其中可能包括患者隐私的密码。这将确保您收到有关患者的最新信息，并让您高枕无忧，因为您可以在白天或晚上的任何时间致电, 以接收有关您所爱之人的最新信息。

Second, let the medical team know what the patient is normally like at home, which can include the patient’s medications, their baseline functional capabilities, any cultural or religious preferences, and their end-of-life wishes, just in case. With this information, the medical team can develop a reasonable treatment plan specific to your loved one, avoid unnecessary and uncomfortable tests, and provide a better insight into their prognosis and recovery.

[.my2]
其次，让医疗团队了解患者通常在家中的情况，其中可以包括患者的药物、他们的基线功能能力、任何文化或宗教偏好, **以及他们的临终愿望，以防万一。**有了这些信息，医疗团队就可以针对您所爱的人, 制定合理的治疗计划，**避免不必要和不舒服的检查，**并更好地了解他们的预后和康复情况。

As you provide information about the patient at home, the medical team should be giving you updates about the patient’s condition in the hospital. This is a good time for you to keep a diary to write down essential information and questions to ask them.

[.my2]
当您提供有关患者在家中的信息时，*医疗团队应该向您提供有关患者在医院的最新状况。这是你写日记的好时机，写下重要信息, 和要问他们的问题。*

Knowing what to ask is essential to effective communication at the hospital. First, get yourself oriented to the hospital unit you are on: Ask about the visitation policy, unit phone number and even where the cafeteria and the bathrooms are.

[.my2]
**知道"要问什么", 对于医院的有效沟通至关重要。**首先，了解您所在的医院病房：询问探视政策、病房电话号码，甚至自助餐厅和浴室在哪里。

Once familiar with your new environment, you may feel more at ease to truly be present for your loved one. Other important questions you can ask each day include:

[.my2]
一旦熟悉了新环境，您可能会更轻松地真正陪伴您所爱的人。*您每天可以提出的其他重要问题包括：*

- What is happening to my loved one? +

[.my2]
*我所爱的人发生了什么事？*

- What is the plan for the next day? +

[.my2]
*第二天的计划是什么？*

- What will the treatment be like for my loved one? +

[.my2]
*我所爱的人会受到怎样的治疗？*

These are good first questions for setting daily expectations for the patient’s hospital stay. You can also find answers by participating in the patient’s clinical rounds. Every day, the interdisciplinary medical team sees each patient to discuss updates and treatment plans, and answers questions for the patient and their family. Research has also shown that rounds relieve anxiety and stress among family caregivers due to the consistent daily communication and emotional support that they provide.

[.my2]
这些是为患者设定每日住院时间预期的首要问题。**您还可以通过参加患者的临床查房, 来找到答案。每天，跨学科医疗团队, 都会见到每位患者，讨论最新情况和治疗计划，并为患者及其家人解答问题。**研究还表明，*查房可以缓解家庭护理人员的焦虑和压力，因为他们提供持续的日常沟通和情感支持。*


==== NURSES CAN BE HELPFUL

[.my2]
护士可以提供帮助

After clinical rounds, the interdisciplinary team of doctors and nurses establishes a daily plan of care for your loved one, which will be carried out by your bedside nurse. The nurse will give the ordered medications, perform necessary clinical tasks and assess the patient for their response to the treatment. If you normally take care of the patient’s basic needs at home, offering to help your nurse with feeding or bathing may provide emotional reassurance to you and your loved one.

[.my2]
**临床查房后，**由医生和护士组成的跨学科团队, 为您所爱的人**制定每日护理计划，该计划将由您的床边护士执行。**护士将给予所订购的药物，**执行必要的临床任务, 并评估患者对治疗的反应。**如果您通常在家照顾患者的基本需求，*主动帮助您的护士喂食或洗澡, 可能会给您和您所爱的人带来情感上的安慰。*

Nurses are the most accessible resource you have when your loved one is in the hospital. They can provide emotional support and coping strategies during this stressful time and can act as a translator between you and the physicians.

[.my2]
当您的亲人住院时，*护士是您最容易获得的资源。他们可以在这个充满压力的时期, 提供情感支持和应对策略，并可以充当您和医生之间的翻译。*

Once you establish a good relationship with your nurse and the medical team, spend quality time with your loved one. Even when the patient isn’t responsive, talk to them about familiar people in their life, FaceTime other family members, play their favorite music or TV show, and always remind them of the date and that they are in the hospital.

[.my2]
一旦您与护士和医疗团队建立了良好的关系，就可以与您所爱的人共度美好时光。**即使患者没有反应，也要与他们谈论生活中熟悉的人，**通过 FaceTime **与其他家庭成员进行通话，播放他们最喜欢的音乐或电视节目，**并始终提醒他们日期以及他们在医院。



==== THE IMPORTANCE OF ROUTINES AND FAMILIARITY

[.my2]
常规和熟悉的重要性

Since it’s easy for patients to lose track of the normal day-night cycle, they can be at high risk of ICU delirium, which is an acute and severe state of confusion. Preventing ICU delirium through reorientation and familiar faces can help prevent this serious complication and can even reduce their hospital stay.

[.my2]
**由于患者很容易失去正常的昼夜周期，因此他们很容易患上 ICU 谵妄，**这是一种急性且严重的混乱状态。通过重新定位和熟悉面孔, 来预防 ICU 谵妄, 可以帮助预防这种严重的并发症，甚至可以减少住院时间。

Finally, one of the most important but often neglected task for you to do is self-care.

[.my2]
最后，*最重要但经常被忽视的任务之一, 就是自我保健*。

Research advises caregivers to tend to their own health and emotional needs by eating regularly, getting adequate sleep and taking breaks from the hospital. You have been strong for others and can continue to do so, but only if you take care of yourself as well.

[.my2]
研究建议**护理人员通过规律饮食、充足睡眠, 和在医院休息, 来满足自己的健康和情感需求。你一直对他人很坚强，并且可以继续这样做，但前提是你也照顾好自己。**
