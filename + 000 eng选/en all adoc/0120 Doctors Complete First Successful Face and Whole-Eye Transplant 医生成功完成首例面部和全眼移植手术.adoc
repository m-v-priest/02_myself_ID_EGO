== Doctors Complete First Successful Face and Whole-Eye Transplan

This week doctors announced they had completed the first successful transplant of a partial face and an entire eye.

He does not yet have vision in the transplanted eye and may never regain it there, but early evidence suggests the eye itself is healthy and may be capable of transmitting neurological signals to the brain.

the main obstacle is achieving regeneration of the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain; this step has not yet been successfully demonstrated in humans.

Cutting-edge three-dimensional (3D) computer surgical planning, along with patient-specific 3D cutting guides, enabled precise alignment of bones and optimal placement of implantable plates and screws.

Face and cornea transplants have been performed before, yet to the NYU Langone team’s knowledge, this is the first time a whole eye has been transplanted successfully (with or without a face). The first partial face transplant was performed in 2005 in France.

The decision was made to transplant the donor’s eye as well, because even if James never regained sight, the organ would help restore his face’s appearance. Like any transplant, there was a chance his immune system would reject the eye—but he would already need to take immunosuppressant medication for the face transplant.

The portions of the face that were transplanted included the nose, left eyelids and eyebrow, lips, underlying skull, nasal and chin bones, cheekbones, and all of the muscle and nerve tissue under the right eye. The entire left eye and optic nerve were transplanted, and stem cells from the donor’s bone marrow were transplanted along with them in the hopes of helping the optic nerve regenerate.

James has since made a good recovery. He is able to talk, and although he does not have much ability to move his lips and facial muscles yet, Rodriguez says he will recover a lot of that ability with time.

As of six months post-transplantation, James does not yet report any vision in the transplanted eye.

Cross-sectional imaging of the donated eye’s macula (the central part of the retina) showed it was thinner after the transplant—but this had been expected because the blood supply had been necessarily disrupted, and a fair number of photoreceptors—light-sensitive cells in the retina—were still present, Dedania says. The photoreceptors appear to be responsive to light in preliminary tests. The medical team plans to conduct more rigorous follow-up testing soon to confirm this, however.

Scientists have been working toward whole-eye transplantation for many years.


Although eye transplants have been done in rodents with some success, the animals’ eyes are much smaller and less vascularized than those of humans. Goldberg and his team have done some research on pig eyes, which are more similar to humans’, but optic nerve regeneration remains a challenge.

surgery is only a small part of the issues that need to be addressed in order to restore eye function, however. These include making sure the immune system doesn’t reject the donor eye, which is a challenge with any type of transplant. Then the corneal nerve—which carries sensory signals from the transparent part of the eye—must be reconnected. Yet the most complex part is regenerating the optic nerve. In order to do so, surgeons have to coax the nerve fibers to grow to the right place, which Sahel says could take months or even years. And complete optic nerve regeneration has not yet been successfully achieved in humans or other mammals.

Even if the optic nerve can regrow, there is the question of whether the brain will be able to interpret the signals from the transplanted eye. The brain has a lot of plasticity, so there is some reason to hope it may be able to adapt to the new input. Until these questions are addressed, “I’m doubtful that you will get a successful transplant in terms of restoring function."
