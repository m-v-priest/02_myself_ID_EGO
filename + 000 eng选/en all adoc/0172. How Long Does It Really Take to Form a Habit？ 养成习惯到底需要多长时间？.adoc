== How Long Does It Really Take to Form a Habit? 养成习惯到底需要多长时间？


Everyone has a unique habit-building timeline —and no matter how long it is for any individual, repetition 重复；重做；重说 is the key to making it work.

每个人都有一个独特的习惯养成时间表，无论对任何人来说有多长，重复都是使其发挥作用的关键.

A hallmark 给……打金银纯度印记；使具有……特征 2009 study on habit creation /found that habits developed (v.) in a range of 18 to 254 days; participants reported taking an average of about 66 days /to reliably 可靠地；确实地 incorporate (v.)将…包括在内；包含；吸收；使并入 one of three new daily activities —eating a piece of fruit with lunch, drinking a bottle of water with lunch /or running for 15 minutes before dinner. Consistent daily repetition /was the biggest factor influencing whether a behavior would become part of an automatic daily routine, says Lally, who was the first author on the study.

2009 年一项关于习惯养成的标志性研究发现，**习惯的养成需要 18 至 254 天的时间。**参与者报告说，他们平均需要大约 66 天的时间才能可靠地融入三项新的日常活动中的一项：午餐时吃一块水果、午餐时喝一瓶水或晚餐前跑步 15 分钟。该研究的第一作者拉利说，*持续的日常重复, 是影响某种行为是否成为自动日常生活一部分的最大因素。*

The type of activity is also a factor.  A 2015 study found that /new gym-goers 健身房常客 had to exercise (v.) at least four times a week for six weeks /in order to develop an exercise habit. And last year /Camerer and his colleagues conducted (v.) a study /that used _machine learning_ to determine (v.) the time 后定 needed for habit-building. In it, machine-learning models ① analyzed (v.) vast amounts of data on repeated observations 观察，观察值；观察结果 of a behavior /② and *factored (v.) 把…因素包括进去 in* different variables that may influence a person’s decision to continue the behavior.  +

The results showed that /`主` creating a handwashing habit `谓` took a few weeks, *compared with* the half year it took for people to develop an exercise habit. Handwashing, the study noted (v.), is less complex than exercising / and offers (v.) more opportunities to practice (v.).  +
The researchers also suggested that /`主` habit formation `谓` #depends on# ① the effort 后定 that a person puts into practicing (v.) an activity /and #on# ② the presence 存在；出现 of _environmental cues_ 后定 that would remind (v.) them to carry out 执行，实施 the behavior.

[.my2]
活动类型也是一个因素。2015 年的一项研究发现，**新健身者必须每周至少锻炼四次，持续六周才能养成锻炼习惯。**去年，卡默勒和他的同事进行了一项研究，利用机器学习来确定养成习惯所需的时间。其中，机器学习模型分析了重复观察行为的大量数据，并考虑了可能影响一个人继续该行为的决定的不同变量。结果显示，**养成洗手习惯需要几周的时间，而人们养成锻炼习惯则需要半年的时间。**研究指出，**洗手比锻炼简单，而且提供了更多的练习机会。**研究人员还认为，*习惯的形成, 取决于一个人在练习某项活动时所付出的努力, 以及提醒他们执行该行为的环境线索的存在。*

When it comes to keeping a resolution, Camerer notes (v.) /it can be hard to stay (v.) motivated /once the initial excitement of a “new year, new me” *wears off* 逐渐减少、消失或停止. This can easily lead to lapsing 衰退；衰弱；（逐渐）消失，结束;背弃，放弃（宗教信仰） /or even dropping (v.)（使）变弱，降低，减少 the activity completely /after a couple of weeks.  +

`主` ① #Creating a specific plan# to perform (v.) the activity (for example, “study (v.) Spanish grammar for 20 minutes three times a week” *versus* (v.)（比较两种不同想法、选择等）与…相对，与…相比 the vague goal “learn (v.) more Spanish”) /#and ② having some type of accountability# 责任，责任心 (an app tracker or a friend) /`谓` #can help# monitor (v.) progress /and push a person to keep going.  +
Additionally, people are more inclined (a.)想（做某事）;有…倾向；很可能 to keep a resolution 坚定；坚决；有决心 that they are interested in doing, *rather than* one that they simply believe they should do.

[.my2]
卡默勒指出，当谈到保持决心时，**一旦“新的一年，新的我”最初的兴奋消退，就很难保持动力。**这很容易导致几周后活动失效甚至完全放弃。*制定具体的计划来执行活动（例如，“每周 3 次，每次 20 分钟学习西班牙语语法”，而不是模糊的目标“学习更多西班牙语”）并承担某种类型的责任（应用程序跟踪器或朋友）, 可以有所帮助监控进展, 并推动一个人继续前进。此外，人们更倾向于保留一项他们"有兴趣做"的决议，而不是他们简单地认为"应该做"的决议。*

.lapse
-> 来源于拉丁语动词labor, labi, laps.us, -(毁坏,滑到)。 与词根-laps-(滑,落)同源

Rewards are great motivators /but only when they’*re given* [right away 立刻,马上]. Lally says that /people often make the mistake of delaying (v.) gratification 满足；满意；快感；令人喜悦的事物 —for example, by treating (v.)以…态度对待；以…方式对待 themselves to a shopping trip on Saturday /after going to the gym all week.  +
A reward is far more effective /if received during the task. For instance, a person with an exercise goal /could watch a newly released movie while running on the treadmill 跑步机 /instead of waiting until the end of the week.  +
Researchers in 2014 *had* (v.) people *listen to* then popular audiobooks (such as _the Hunger Games_ trilogy 三部曲；三部剧 and _The Devil Wears (v.) Prada_) that could only be accessed at the gym during the experiment /and found that the participants initially went (v.) 51 percent *more frequently than* the control group.

[.my2]
**奖励是很大的激励因素，但只有当它们立即给予时才有效。**拉利说，**人们经常犯延迟满足的错误，**例如，在去了健身房一周之后，周六去购物。**如果在任务期间获得奖励，效果会更佳。**例如，一个有锻炼目标的人可以一边在跑步机上跑步, 一边观看新上映的电影，而不是等到周末才开始锻炼。 2014 年，研究人员让人们听当时流行的有声读物（例如《饥饿游戏》三部曲和《穿普拉达的女王》），这些读物只能在实验期间在健身房阅读，结果发现参与者最初去的频率, 比对照组高 51%。

Another tip 后定 Lally recommends /is `表`  *pairing* (v.)配对 the desired behavior *with* a reliable cue. For example, `主` if a person goes to the office two days a week, scheduling (v.)安排；为…安排时间；预定 gym sessions 一场；一节；一段时间 [right after work] /`谓` reinforces (v.)加固；使更结实 an association that trains (v.) the brain. #The more# you relate (v.)联系；使有联系；把…联系起来 the two behaviors, #the stronger# the resulting (a.)因而发生的，作为结果的 neural connections in _brain regions_ 后定 involved in memory and habit formation.

[.my2]
拉利建议的另一个技巧是, **将所需的"行为", 与可靠的"提示"配对 (如同巴甫洛夫的狗, 看到什么就形成条件反射)。**例如，如果一个人每周去办公室两天，那么在下班后安排健身房锻炼, 可以强化训练大脑的联系。*这两种行为联系得越多，涉及记忆和习惯形成的大脑区域的神经连接就越强。*

Reconfiguring (v.)重新配置（计算机设备等）；重新设定（程序等） your physical space 物理空间 /may also help. If your goal is to eat more fruit, for instance, Lally says you are more likely to do it /if you keep a variety of fruits stocked and on display in your house. This also *applies to* breaking (v.) habits. People *partaking (v.)参加；参与 in* “Dry January” /may empty _the liquor cabinet_ beforehand (ad.)事先，预先，提前 to avoid temptation 引诱，诱惑. While this might help temporarily, drug and alcohol addictions /require (v.) more serious medical intervention and time.

[.my2]
**重新配置您的物理空间, 也可能有所帮助。例如，如果你的目标是吃更多的水果，拉利说，如果你在家里储备和展示各种水果，你就更有可能做到这一点。这也适用于打破习惯。参加“干一月”的人们, 可能会提前清空酒柜, 以避免诱惑 (眼不见, 心不想)。**虽然这可能暂时有所帮助，但药物和酒精成瘾需要更严重的医疗干预和时间。

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MISS A DAY?

[.my2]
如果您错过一天会发生什么？


If you feel that you are *falling off* 数量减少；质量下降 track, Lally advises (v.) *taking a beat* (（音乐、诗歌等的）主节奏，节拍) 暂停一下,停顿一下 to evaluate 评价，评估 why you are missing days /and *to come up with* 找到（答案）；拿出（一笔钱等） ways to fix the problem.  +
Instead of running 10 miles every day, try jogging 慢跑锻炼 two miles three times a week. If that’s still too challenging, adjust even more by slowing the pace or shortening the distance, and then eventually work (v.) yourself back up to the original goal. Putting on sneakers 胶底运动鞋 and walking down the block 走过街区 /may not seem like much of an achievement at first, but it’s a step in the right direction.

[.my2]
如果你觉得自己偏离了轨道，拉利建议你花点时间评估一下你缺勤的原因，并想出解决问题的方法。不要每天跑 10 英里，而是尝试每周慢跑 3 次，每次 2 英里。如果这仍然太具有挑战性，请通过放慢速度或缩短距离来进行更多调整，然后最终让自己回到原来的目标。穿上运动鞋并沿着街区漫步乍一看似乎并不是什么成就，但这是朝着正确方向迈出的一步。

So don’t kick yourself if you didn’t reach your goal by the 21st of this month. As long as you keep at an activity, you will get better at it —no matter how long it takes.

[.my2]
因此，如果您在本月 21 日之前(指一项广为流传的谣言,宣称21天能养成新的习惯) 没有实现目标，请不要自责。*只要你坚持一项活动，你就会做得更好——无论需要多长时间。*

== How Long Does It Really Take to Form a Habit?



Everyone has a unique habit-building timeline—and no matter how long it is for any individual, repetition is the key to making it work.



A hallmark 2009 study on habit creation found that habits developed in a range of 18 to 254 days; participants reported taking an average of about 66 days to reliably incorporate one of three new daily activities—eating a piece of fruit with lunch, drinking a bottle of water with lunch or running for 15 minutes before dinner. Consistent daily repetition was the biggest factor influencing whether a behavior would become part of an automatic daily routine, says Lally, who was the first author on the study.


The type of activity is also a factor. Teaching yourself a completely new skill or process obviously takes longer than remembering to drink more water in the morning, Lally notes. A 2015 study found that new gym-goers had to exercise at least four times a week for six weeks in order to develop an exercise habit. And last year Camerer and his colleagues conducted a study that used machine learning to determine the time needed for habit-building. In it, machine-learning models analyzed vast amounts of data on repeated observations of a behavior and factored in different variables that may influence a person’s decision to continue the behavior. The results showed that creating a handwashing habit took a few weeks, compared with the half year it took for people to develop an exercise habit. Handwashing, the study noted, is less complex than exercising and offers more opportunities to practice. The researchers also suggested that habit formation depends on the effort that a person puts into practicing an activity and on the presence of environmental cues that would remind them to carry out the behavior.



When it comes to keeping a resolution, Camerer notes it can be hard to stay motivated once the initial excitement of a “new year, new me” wears off. This can easily lead to lapsing or even dropping the activity completely after a couple of weeks. Creating a specific plan to perform the activity (for example, “study Spanish grammar for 20 minutes three times a week” versus the vague goal “learn more Spanish”) and having some type of accountability (an app tracker or a friend) can help monitor progress and push a person to keep going. Additionally, people are more inclined to keep a resolution that they are interested in doing, rather than one that they simply believe they should do.



Rewards are great motivators but only when they’re given right away. Lally says that people often make the mistake of delaying gratification—for example, by treating themselves to a shopping trip on Saturday after going to the gym all week. A reward is far more effective if received during the task. For instance, a person with an exercise goal could watch a newly released movie while running on the treadmill instead of waiting until the end of the week. Researchers in 2014 had people listen to then popular audiobooks (such as the Hunger Games trilogy and The Devil Wears Prada) that could only be accessed at the gym during the experiment and found that the participants initially went 51 percent more frequently than the control group.


Another tip Lally recommends is pairing the desired behavior with a reliable cue. For example, if a person goes to the office two days a week, scheduling gym sessions right after work reinforces an association that trains the brain. The more you relate the two behaviors, the stronger the resulting neural connections in brain regions involved in memory and habit formation.


Reconfiguring your physical space may also help. If your goal is to eat more fruit, for instance, Lally says you are more likely to do it if you keep a variety of fruits stocked and on display in your house. This also applies to breaking habits. People partaking in “Dry January” may empty the liquor cabinet beforehand to avoid temptation. While this might help temporarily, drug and alcohol addictions require more serious medical intervention and time.


WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MISS A DAY?



If you feel that you are falling off track, Lally advises taking a beat to evaluate why you are missing days and to come up with ways to fix the problem. Instead of running 10 miles every day, try jogging two miles three times a week. If that’s still too challenging, adjust even more by slowing the pace or shortening the distance, and then eventually work yourself back up to the original goal. Putting on sneakers and walking down the block may not seem like much of an achievement at first, but it’s a step in the right direction.

So don’t kick yourself if you didn’t reach your goal by the 21st of this month. As long as you keep at an activity, you will get better at it—no matter how long it takes.
