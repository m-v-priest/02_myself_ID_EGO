== <prue> Academic sexism


In any case, the survey yielded more than enough reports of sexual harassment. Nearly 2,000 respondents said they had been embarrassed or offended by inappropriate gestures, remarks or materials from other economists. Hundreds reported experiences of attempted or actual sexual assault by a colleague or student in the past ten years. And 267 reported that they would have been rewarded [had they co-operated with unwanted sexual attention], or threatened with retaliation [had they not].

A meta-analysis of studies of the prevalence of sexual harassment in 2003 ranked academia second only to the armed forces.

Our interviewees found it much easier to name prominent bullies than notorious harassers. A senior professor said that she had seen a special nastiness (reserved for people regarded as vulnerable, including women). Others claimed only to have seen “assholes” who were indiscriminate in their aggression.


Unfair treatment can be unwitting. Senior professors may be unconsciously drawn to favour students who look like their younger selves. They may like chatting about work over a drink, which young women may find uncomfortable. One PhD student said she felt that female students found {it harder to connect with male professors}. She suspected {that was partly due to unspoken worries about harassment}.


Then there is the style of seminars, for which economics is notorious. Interruptions and intense questioning are supposed to weed out errors and uncover sloppy thinking. And several interviewees told of supportive sub-fields and departments, where the primary purpose was not to tear down the speaker. But one said she felt like quitting after seeing how a female presenter was treated. Another economist reported being asked during a presentation whether she knew any economics, and being interrupted incessantly.

Among macroeconomists, whose field is both particularly short of women and infamous for bare-knuckled seminars, 40% of those (responding to the AEA’s survey) felt “disrespected”; among female macroeconomists, 70% did.
