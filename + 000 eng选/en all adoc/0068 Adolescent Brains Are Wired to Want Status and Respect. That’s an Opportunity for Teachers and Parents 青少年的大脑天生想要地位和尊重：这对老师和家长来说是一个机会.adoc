== Adolescent Brains Are Wired to Want Status and Respect: That’s an Opportunity for Teachers and Parents 青少年的大脑天生想要地位和尊重：这对老师和家长来说是一个机会


Here is a parable 寓言故事 for our time: There once was an adult /who wanted to encourage eighth graders 某某年级的学生 to eat healthier food. The adult designed a lesson plan /full of nutritional  营养的 information —why fruit and vegetables are good for you, why junk food is bad for you, and so on. A similar approach had worked with younger children. But the eighth graders declared (v.)宣布；宣告,宣称；断言 the intervention —and, if we're being honest, the adult —boring. They *carried on* 继续;开展; 参与 eating junk food, some of them /in greater quantities than they had before.

有一个适合我们这个时代的寓言：曾经有一个成年人想鼓励八年级学生吃更健康的食物。这位成人设计了一个充满营养信息的课程计划——为什么水果和蔬菜对你有益，为什么垃圾食品对你有害，等等。类似的方法也适用于年幼的孩子。但八年级学生表示这种干预——而且，老实说，成年人——很无聊。他们继续吃垃圾食品，其中一些人吃的数量, 比上课前的还要多。

令人沮丧的是，研究人员发现，对年幼儿童有效的方法对青少年不再有效。八年级似乎是一个转折点。

十三岁的孩子关心地位和尊重——这些孩子不想感受到成年人的居高临下。在 2019 年《自然人类行为》杂志上发表的一项研究中，研究人员向德克萨斯州 300 多名八年级学生展示了调查报告，而不是营养信息，这些报告显示食品公司高管使用不健康的成分，在营销中针对青少年，并且不让自己的孩子孩子们吃他们的产品。学生们感到愤怒，并开始将健康饮食视为反对被操纵的一种方式。在接下来的三个月里，学生们在食堂购买了更健康的零食。在一项后续研究中，研究人员发现，睾丸激素（男孩和女孩青春期成熟的标志）水平较高的学生，尤其是男孩，最有可能对干预措施做出良好反应。

神经科学家表明，青春期迎来了神经元旺盛生长的时期，随后是神经连接的修剪，这种修剪仅次于生命前三年发生的类似过程。他们还表明，青少年大脑的成熟不是线性的。边缘系统是对情绪、奖励、新奇、威胁, 和同伴期望敏感的大脑区域的集合，它经历了一个突飞猛进的成长，而负责推理、判断和执行功能的大脑区域, 则继续缓慢、稳定地迈向成年。由此产生的发展力量的不平衡, 有助于解释青少年的冲动、冒险, 以及对社会奖励和学习的敏感性。从进化的角度来看，青少年的许多行为, 促使他们离开家庭的安全，去探索更大的社会世界 ——这是成为独立成年人的一步。

他们向达尔介绍了五年级衰退和八年级悬崖的概念，这是一种现象，儿童对教育的脱离开始缓慢，在五年级左右，当大多数学生10岁时，成绩和参与度下降，并加速，所以这些学生在三年后仍然不及格。

== Adolescent Brains Are Wired to Want Status and Respect: That’s an Opportunity for Teachers and Parents




Here is a parable for our time: There once was an adult who wanted to encourage eighth graders to eat healthier food. The adult designed a lesson plan full of nutritional information—why fruit and vegetables are good for you, why junk food is bad for you, and so on. A similar approach had worked with younger children. But the eighth graders declared the intervention—and, if we're being honest, the adult—boring. They carried on eating junk food, some of them in greater quantities than they had before.

With discouraging regularity, researchers find that what works with younger children is no longer effective with adolescents. Eighth grade seems to be the inflection point.

Thirteen-year-olds are concerned with status and respect—these kids do not want to feel patronized by adults. In a study published in 2019 in Nature Human Behaviour, instead of nutritional information, researchers showed more than 300 eighth graders in Texas investigative reports revealing that food company executives use unhealthy ingredients, target young adolescents in their marketing, and won't let their own children eat their products. The students were outraged and began to see healthy eating as a way of taking a stand against being manipulated. For the next three months the students made healthier snack purchases in the cafeteria. And in a follow-up study, the researchers found that the students, especially boys, with higher levels of testosterone (a marker of pubertal maturation in both boys and girls) were most likely to respond well to the intervention.

Neuroscience has dramatically changed our understanding of the structural and functional changes in the brain during adolescence, which runs from around the age of 10 all the way into the mid-20s. It is a time of rapid brain growth and neuronal fine-tuning when young people are especially sensitive to social cues and rewards.


A sensitive period for social and emotional processing also suggests that certain phases of adolescence may be more opportune than others for certain approaches. Early adolescence in particular—from roughly age nine to 11—could be an opportunity to launch kids on a positive path by buttressing their sense of self and motivation to learn.

To meaningfully compare the results of which interventions work best at age 10 or 14 or 18 requires extensive longitudinal studies, which have not yet been done.

For decades much of the research on adolescence focused on its dark side. Although those years are the physically healthiest period in life, when strength, speed, reaction time, reasoning abilities and immune function all improve or peak, adolescence also brings alarming increases in rates of accidents, suicide, homicide, depression, alcohol and substance use, violence, reckless behaviors, eating disorders, obesity and sexually transmitted disease compared with the rates for younger children.

Neuroscientists showed that puberty ushers in a period of exuberant neuronal growth followed by a pruning of neural connections that is second only to the similar process that occurs in the first three years of life. They also showed that the maturation of the adolescent brain is not linear. The limbic system, a collection of brain areas that are sensitive to emotion, reward, novelty, threat and peer expectations, undergoes a growth spurt while the brain areas responsible for reasoning, judgment and executive function continue their slow, steady march toward adulthood. The resulting imbalance in the developmental forces helps to explain adolescent impulsivity, risk taking, and sensitivity to social reward and learning. In an evolutionary sense, much of adolescents' behavior pushes them to leave the safety of family to explore the larger social world—a step on the way to becoming independent adults.


Another line of research, from the human connectome project, shows that adult brains vary in their patterns of neural connections throughout the brain, whereas children's connectomes are less distinctive. Those differentiated patterns of connection emerge in adolescence—between the ages of 10 and 16, just when social values and cognition are developing quickly. And the changes in the connectome data show up on average a year to a year and a half earlier in girls than in boys, just like puberty does, which suggests that the two things are intertwined.




The idea that adolescence might constitute a sensitive period for social and emotional processing was put forward in 2014 by neuroscientists Sarah-Jayne Blakemore and Kathryn Mills, now at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oregon, respectively. Previous research had assumed that social-cognitive abilities such as theory of mind were mature by the middle of childhood, but Blakemore and Mills laid out the many continuing changes across adolescence in social cognition and the network of brain regions governing social behavior.


Sensitive, or critical, periods are windows of time when the brain is primed to make specific neural connections that depend on the input received. They are timed to when important information is available and most useful for development. For sensory processing such as vision and hearing, such periods are well defined with an opening, peak and closing. A brain deprived of sight or sound early in development will never be able to see or hear normally. Likewise, a sensitive period for language acquisition explains why people who learn a foreign language after puberty typically have an accent. Sensitive periods for social learning have been harder to pin down.


These windows of rapid change create both learning opportunities and vulnerabilities. What adolescents are learning is all-important. “The adolescent brain is primed for social and emotional learning, to explore, to interact, to take chances so they can learn, but it all depends on what we do to give them scaffolded opportunities in order to learn,” says psychologist Andrew Fuligni of the University of California, Los Angeles. Harmful experiences may lead to negative spirals from which it's hard to recover. Research has shown that earlier experimentation with alcohol and drugs makes an adolescent more likely to become addicted.


Protective factors in the adolescent's environment could support positive trajectories. What do protective factors look like? They include supportive relationships with family and caretakers and access to resources such as scaffolded opportunities to learn in positive ways. They also include some elements that have previously been underappreciated. Fuligni's research shows that adolescents have a need to contribute to society, and doing so makes them feel valued and can safeguard against anxiety and depression. “Part of what the brain is designed to do during the teenage years is to learn how to contribute to the social world,” Fuligni says.


There is still debate about how best to use the new neuroscientific knowledge to help adolescents. “We've learned an enormous amount about the brain, but the application of that knowledge is not straightforward,” Allen says.



They introduced Dahl to the idea of the fifth grade slump and the eighth grade cliff, a phenomenon in which children's disengagement with education starts slowly with a dip in grades and participation around fifth grade, when most students are 10, and accelerates so that those same students are failing three years later. “Smaller, more subtle, positive interventions earlier are probably a much more promising way to improve population health.”


It is not surprising then that those interventions that look most promising take into account adolescents' desire for status and respect, as well as their need to contribute and find a sense of purpose. According to Fuligni, the most successful volunteer programs give adolescents a say in what to work on and a chance to reflect on the work, and the projects also feel meaningful. Meaning seems to matter in other efforts, too. In a study of early adolescents participating in a 4-H program, Burrow found that those who were asked to write about their sense of purpose before engaging in an educational activity were more likely to engage with the activity and find it important and interesting. “Purpose is a pretty powerful form of identity capital because it's not just an answer to the question of who you are, but it's an answer to the question of who you're going to be and the direction you're heading in,” Burrow says. “It's got legs.”

One series of experiments showed that the framing of a request to take medicine predicted different rates of compliance and that those rates varied with testosterone levels. Some 18- and 19-year-olds came into the lab and were given instructions in a condescending way: I'm the expert, I know what's good for you, take this. Another group of young adults were given instructions in a more respectful manner: Let me explain the reasons this medicine can be useful.

For ethical reasons, the medicine in question was actually a spoonful of Vegemite, a notoriously strong-tasting condiment. Asked respectfully, people were twice as likely to take the Vegemite. Furthermore, participants with higher testosterone levels were significantly less likely to take the medicine in the disrespectful condition and more likely to comply in the respectful condition. When Yeager and his colleagues manipulated testosterone levels with a nasal inhaler, they found that doing so made individuals with naturally low testosterone levels behave just like those with naturally high testosterone levels.
