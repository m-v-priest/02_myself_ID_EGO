== Why Does Fruitcake Last So Long? 水果蛋糕为什么能保存这么久？

Nowadays fruitcakes are a holiday delicacy still prized for their long-lasting freshness. +
如今，水果蛋糕已成为节日美食，因其持久的新鲜度而备受推崇。 +

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, these seemingly indestructible pastries typically stay fresh for six months in the pantry and up to a year when refrigerated. +
根据美国农业部的说法，这些看起来坚不可摧的糕点, 在食品储藏室里, 通常可以保鲜六个月，冷藏后可以保鲜一年。 +

One ingredient that bolsters fruitcake’s longevity is alcohol. +
延长水果蛋糕保质期的一种成分是酒精。 +

Many classic home recipes involve soaking the cake in rum, brandy or bourbon—liquor that can add some flavor but is mostly used for its antimicrobial properties. +
许多经典的家庭食谱都涉及将蛋糕浸泡在朗姆酒、白兰地或波本酒中，这些酒可以增加一些风味，但主要是因为其抗菌特性。 +

Alcohol makes a fruitcake more acidic, creating a harsh environment for many common foodborne microbes. +
酒精会使水果蛋糕变得更加酸性，为许多常见的食源性微生物创造了恶劣的环境。 +

Booze destroys the cells of many bacteria, mold spores and other potential pathogens that survive the baking process or accumulate when food is left out at room temperature. +
酒会破坏许多细菌、霉菌孢子和其他潜在病原体的细胞，这些病原体在烘烤过程中存活下来，或者在食物放在室温下时积聚起来。 +

But even though alcohol is common in traditional homemade recipes, commercially prepared fruitcakes rarely contain it. +
但尽管酒精在传统的自制食谱中很常见，但商业制作的水果蛋糕却很少含有酒精。 +

The shelf life of an alcohol-free fruitcake is likely shorter than one prepared with spirits. +
不含酒精的水果蛋糕的保质期可能比用烈酒制作的水果蛋糕的保质期短。 +

The fruit in a fruitcake is often dried instead of fresh, which reduces moisture and creates this dessert’s notoriously dry texture. +
水果蛋糕中的水果通常是干的而不是新鲜的，这会减少水分并造成这种甜点众所周知的干燥质地。 +

This, along with the high sugar content, sucks up much of the water that bacteria need to survive. +
这与高糖含量一起，吸收了细菌生存所需的大量水分。 +

Foods with low amounts of moisture, like fruitcakes and Twinkies, are resistant to the growth of microorganisms because you need a certain amount of moisture for spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms to grow. +
水分含量低的食品，如水果蛋糕和奶油夹心蛋糕，能够抵抗微生物的生长，因为腐败和病原微生物的生长需要一定量的水分。 +
 +
commercially prepared fruitcakes and Twinkies have antibacterial and antifungal preservatives to increase their shelf life. +
商业制备的水果蛋糕和奶油夹心含有抗菌和抗真菌防腐剂，以延长其保质期。 +
 +
A FRUIT CAKE’S DENSE TEXTURE STALLS STALENESS +
水果蛋糕的致密质地可防止变质 +
 +
Fruitcakes have a reputation for being as heavy as a rock. +
水果蛋糕以重如岩石而闻名。 +
But it’s partly thanks to this high density that they stay fresh longer than breads and cakes with light, fluffy textures. +
但部分归功于这种高密度，它们比质地轻盈、蓬松的面包和蛋糕保鲜时间更长。 +
 +
The interplay between density and moisture influences how quickly foods become stale. +
密度和湿度之间的相互作用会影响食物变质的速度。 +

When bread is baked, water in the dough rearranges starch molecules from a rigid structure to a disorganized one that helps to form air pockets. +
烘烤面包时，面团中的水会将淀粉分子从刚性结构重新排列成无序结构，从而有助于形成气穴。 +

Baked goods made with wetter dough have more air pockets, which create a soft, light texture. +
用湿面团制成的烘焙食品有更多的气穴，从而产生柔软、轻盈的质地。 +

But the porousness also exposes more starches to the outside air, which draws out water and eventually shuffles the starch molecules back into a solid crystalline structure. +
但多孔性也使更多的淀粉暴露在外部空气中，从而吸出水分，最终将淀粉分子重新打乱成固体晶体结构。 +

The resulting rigidity makes once-supple baked goods stale and tough to chew. +
由此产生的刚性使曾经柔软的烘焙食品变得陈旧且难以咀嚼。 +

Fruitcake’s denser texture allows far fewer air pockets to form, protecting more of the starches from the air. +
水果蛋糕的质地更致密，形成的气穴要少得多，从而保护更多的淀粉免受空气的影响。 +

COULD YOU STOMACH A 50-YEAR-OLD FRUITCAKE? +
您能接受 50 年的水果蛋糕吗？ +

Like a fine wine, a well-made fruitcake can actually get more flavorful over time. +
就像美酒一样，精心制作的水果蛋糕实际上会随着时间的推移变得更加美味。 +

Tannins ooze out of the dried fruit, chemically changing the cake’s composition to produce a fruity and spicy taste. +
单宁从干果中渗出，通过化学方式改变蛋糕的成分，产生果香和辛辣的味道。 +

Some bakers recommend intentionally aging fruitcakes for a few weeks to months in a cool, dark place to enhance the taste and texture. +
一些面包师建议故意将水果蛋糕放在凉爽、黑暗的地方陈化几周到几个月，以增强味道和质地。 +

But these pleasant, complex flavors only last about a year or two, Le says. +
但勒说，这些令人愉快、复杂的味道只能持续大约一两年。 +

This is because of oxidation, a process whereby chemical reactions between the food and oxygen transform unsaturated fatty acids into compounds called lipid hydroperoxides. +
这是因为氧化，这是食物和氧气之间发生化学反应将不饱和脂肪酸转化为脂质氢过氧化物的化合物的过程。 +

Further breakdown of these compounds creates smaller molecules such as aldehydes and ketones, which can create bitter or unpleasantly leatherlike flavors and aromas. +
这些化合物的进一步分解会产生更小的分子，例如醛和酮，它们会产生苦味或令人不愉快的皮革味道和香气。 +

The likelihood that any of the fats in a [50-year-old] fruitcake are not oxidized or rancid is pretty low. +
[50 年] 水果蛋糕中的任何脂肪没有被氧化或酸败的可能性相当低。 +

That said, even though a decades-old fruitcake might taste like a leather shoe, eating it probably won’t make you dangerously sick. +
也就是说，尽管几十年前的水果蛋糕尝起来可能像皮鞋，但吃它可能不会让你患上危险的疾病。 +

the dessert’s characteristic resistance to pathogen growth greatly reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses from Escherichia coli or Salmonella bacteria. +
该甜点对病原体生长的独特抵抗力大大降低了大肠杆菌或沙门氏菌引起的食源性疾病的风险。
