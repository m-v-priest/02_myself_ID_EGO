在欧洲，智库会派遣工作人员, 作为特别顾问, 进入政府，并努力影响公众辩论。 而在中国，评估智库的影响力则比较困难，因为中国的旋转门是单向的:官员们可退休并加入智库，但很少重返政府。并且掌权的执政党也从未改变。

在与美国的贸易战中，学者们被召集起来，就中国政府公告的措辞提出建议。聪明的智库们, 准备了公开版本和内部版本的文件。官员们还要求他们提出一些权贵们不愿大声说出的观点。不过，一位著名的研究人员表示，不要相信任何自称代表权贵来说话的政策书呆子。“如果他真的和那些vvvip们关系非常密切的话，他是不会告诉你那些权贵的内心真实想法的。”

== <pure> China says it wants more “independent” think-tanks


In Europe, think-tanks send staff into government as special advisers and work to shape public debate. Assessing influence is harder in China, where the revolving door is one-way: officials may retire into think-tanks, but seldom return to government. And the party in power never changes.

During the trade war with America, scholars have been summoned to advise [on the wording of Chinese government announcements]. Smart think-tanks prepare public and neibu versions of papers. They are also asked by officials to advance arguments that bigwigs prefer not to make aloud.

Distrust any policy wonk who claims to speak for a grandee, though, says a prominent researcher. “If he is really close to those VVVIPs, he cannot tell you.”
