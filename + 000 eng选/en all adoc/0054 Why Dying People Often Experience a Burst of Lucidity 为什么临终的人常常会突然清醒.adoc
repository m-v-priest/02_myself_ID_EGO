== Why Dying People Often Experience a Burst of Lucidity 为什么临终的人常常会突然清醒

Around 1959 /humans discovered a method to restart the heart in people /who would have died, and we called this CPR 心肺复苏术.

大约在 1959 年，人类发现了一种方法可以让本来会死去的人重新启动心脏，我们称之为心肺复苏术. 现在，医生可以在心脏停止跳动 20 分钟或更长时间后使一些人苏醒。 许多脑细胞在死后数小时到数天都保持完好无损——这挑战了我们关于生与死之间严格界限的观念。

帕尼亚认为，垂死的大脑失去了通常的抑制机制，使我们能够在日常生活中专注于个人任务。 “当你死去时，你的大脑会被剥夺氧气和营养，因此它会关闭，”Parnia 说。 “这个关闭过程取消了刹车……突然间似乎发生的事情是：它让你可以访问你通常无法访问的大脑部分……。你所有的想法、你的记忆或你与其他人的互动都会出来。”但他强调，经历心脏骤停的人的经历是清醒的，而不仅仅是幻觉。 “他们不是妄想，”帕尼亚谈到他研究过的复苏的人时说，他们所经历的“不是梦或幻觉”。

== Why Dying People Often Experience a Burst of Lucidity

Around 1959 humans discovered a method to restart the heart in people who would have died, and we called this CPR.  Now doctors can revive some people up to 20 minutes or more after their heart has stopped beating. Many brain cells remain somewhat intact for hours to days postmortem—challenging our notions of a rigid boundary between life and death.


Large surveys are documenting the seemingly inexplicable periods of lucidity that hospice workers and grieving families often report witnessing in people with dementia who are dying. As more resources are devoted to the study of death, it is becoming increasingly clear that dying is not the simple dimming of one’s internal light of awareness but rather an incredibly active process in the brain.

For decades, researchers, hospice caregivers and stunned family members have watched with awe as people with Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia suddenly regain their memories and personalities just before death. To their family members it might seem like a second lease on life, but for many experienced medical workers, it can be a sign the end is near. ... He says these events “usually occur in the last few days of life.”

“what we found is lucidity was more common than it was the exception in dementia patients. We’ve actually found that a variety of these episodes occurred months, even years, before the person died." Many experts including Kerr and Parnia agree that most of these episodes are associated with the approach of death. “It’s almost like they’re preparing themselves to die” .

The potential implications of these widespread, temporary cognitive resurgences are profound. “It suggests there may be neural networks that are remaining, and/or pathways and neural function, that could help potentially restore cognitive abilities to individuals we otherwise think are permanently impaired,” Peterson says.

"Nevertheless, research into this phenomenon is still in its early phases. “We don’t actually know what’s going on in the brain during the dying process that may in some way connect to these episodes.”

In all of these investigations, the researchers found that gamma-wave activity surged within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest and then ceased. Gamma waves are a frequency of brain wave typically associated with wakefulness, alertness and memory recall.

The surge of gamma waves in dying subjects was particularly intense in a brain region Borjigin refers to as the “posterior cortical ‘hot zone,’” located near the back of the skull. Some other researchers believe this region may also be essential to conscious experience. The parts of the brain in this area are related to visual, auditory and motion perception—a phenomenon Borjigin believes is involved in the out-of-body experiences reported by people who come close to death and recover. She adds that gamma-wave activation patterns akin to those observed in the comatose people are associated with activities that include the recognition of a familiar image—such as a human face—in healthy people.


In both the human and animal studies, the subjects’ brain showed a spike in activity after the sudden reduction of oxygen supply, Borjigin says. “It starts to activate this homeostatic mechanism to get oxygen back, either by breathing harder or making your heart beat faster,” she adds. Borjigin hypothesizes that much of the surge in more complex brain activity observed in humans and animals undergoing cardiac arrest is also a result of the brain attempting to reestablish homeostasis, or biological equilibrium, after detecting a lack of oxygen. She further speculates that these survival mechanisms may be involved in other changes in cognition surrounding death. “I believe dementia patients’ terminal lucidity may be due to these kinds of last-ditch efforts of the brain” to preserve itself as physiological systems fail, Borjigin says.

Parnia believes the dying brain loses the usual suppression mechanisms that allow us to focus on individual tasks during our day-to-day lives. “When you die, your brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, so it shuts down,” Parnia says. “This shutting down process takes away the brakes…, and suddenly what seems to be happening is: it gives you access to parts of your brain that you normally can’t access…. All your thoughts or your memories or your interactions with everyone else come out.” But he stresses that the experiences of people undergoing cardiac arrest are lucid, not merely hallucinations. “They’re not delusional,” Parnia says of the resuscitated people he studied, and what they’re experiencing is “not dreams or hallucinations.”
