== Chronic UTI Pain Could Be Caused by Overgrown Nerves 慢性尿路感染疼痛可能是由过度生长的神经引起的

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the world’s most common bacterial maladies. Approximately 12 percent of men and roughly half of all women experience a UTI in their lifetime. Up to 44 percent of women who get a UTI develop a second infection within six months. And for some, painful UTI symptoms recur and become chronic—even after the infection has cleared and the harmful bacteria are no longer present in the urinary tract.

**尿路感染 (UTI) 是世界上最常见的细菌性疾病之一。**大约 12% 的男性和大约一半的女性在一生中经历过尿路感染。**高达 44% 的患有尿路感染的女性, 会在六个月内发生第二次感染。**对于某些人来说，痛苦的尿路感染症状, *会反复出现, 并转为慢性——即使在感染已经清除, 并且尿道中不再存在有害细菌之后也是如此。*

.urinary tract infection，UTI 泌尿道感染
也称为"急性膀胱炎"或"膀胱感染". *泌尿道分为上、下泌尿道，感染部位不同对应到不同疾病名称：* +

|Header 1 |膀胱炎|肾盂肾炎

|影响区域
|下泌尿道
|上泌尿道(肾脏)

|症状
|排尿时会疼痛, 也可能会有"频尿", 或是"一直想要解尿"的感觉
|除了会有跟"下泌尿道感染"同样症状外，还会有发烧、腹痛的症状。

|病因
|- *最常见造成"泌尿道感染"（上下泌尿道都有可能）的病菌是"大肠杆菌"*，而其他细菌、病毒或霉菌, 则鲜少造成感染。
- 在性行为活跃的年轻女性中，75-90%"膀胱感染"是由性行为引起，且感染的风险与性爱频率相关。“蜜月膀胱炎”的术语已经用来描述在婚姻初期常患有上尿道感染疾病的现象。
- 当女性的雌激素随着停经, 而减少分泌时，尿道感染的几率也会提高，原因是缺少了阴道菌群的保护功能。
- 慢性前列腺炎, 也会导致男性尿道感染疾病的复发。其感染风险也会随着男性的年龄增长提高。而较高龄男性的尿液中, 普遍上都有细菌的存在.
- 导尿会增加尿道感染的风险。患有脊椎损伤的人, 因为长期使用导尿管, 及排尿的功能异常，有更高"泌尿道感染"的风险.

|影响人数
|约过半数的女性, 在其一生中有出现过"泌尿道感染"的情形。 +
泌尿道感染也常会复发。

Scientists have long puzzled over why UTI pain lingers in some people, but new research has just identified a likely cause: a study published Friday in Science Immunology describes how recurrent UTIs can lead to an overgrowth of pelvic nerve cells, which prolong the pain of an infection.

科学家们长期以来一直对"为什么尿路感染疼痛, 在某些人身上挥之不去"感到困惑，但新的研究刚刚发现了一个可能的原因：周五发表在《科学免疫学》上的一项研究描述了**复发性尿路感染, 如何导致"盆腔神经细胞"过度生长，从而延长了感染的疼痛。**


the new research began with a simple question: “Why do we see these UTI symptoms without necessarily seeing any bacteria in the urine of the patient?” To find out, he and his team examined bladder tissue biopsies from 25 people with lingering UTI pain but no trace of associated bacteria in their urine and from 12 others without such pain. The researchers found that those reporting frequent UTI symptoms had significantly more nerves packed into their pelvic tissue compared with the control group.

[.my2]
这项新研究始于一个简单的问题：“*为什么我们看到这些尿路感染症状，却不一定在患者尿液中看到任何细菌？*”为了找到答案，他和他的团队检查了 25 名患有尿路感染疼痛, 但尿液中没有相关细菌痕迹的人, 以及另外 12 名没有这种疼痛的人的膀胱组织活检。研究人员发现，*与对照组相比，那些经常报告尿路感染症状的人的"盆腔组织中的神经"明显更多。(即这两个变量间具有"相关性")*



The next piece of the puzzle was determining whether these extra nerves were the result of repeated infection—or its cause. The researchers infected rodents’ bladders with Escherichia coli bacteria and treated them with antibiotics, allowed them to recover and then repeated the process. Thiscaused the mice to display continuing UTI symptoms, such as frequent urination and signs of pelvic sensitivity. And mice that had undergone three UTI infection-and-treatment cycles had similar nerve overgrowth to that observed in the human biopsies. In contrast, mice that only experienced one infection did not have an overabundance of nerves.

[.my2]
**下一个难题是: 确定这些额外的神经, 是反复感染的"结果"还是其"原因"。**研究人员用"大肠杆菌"感染啮齿动物的膀胱，并用抗生素治疗它们，让它们康复，然后重复这个过程。这导致小鼠表现出持续的"尿路感染"症状，例如"尿频"和"骨盆敏感"的迹象。*经历了三个尿路感染感染和治疗周期的小鼠, 也出现了与人类活组织检查中观察到的类似的神经过度生长。相比之下，只经历过一次感染的小鼠并没有过多的神经。*


The researchers think repeated bacterial infections may activate specialized immune cells known as mast cells, which release a compound called nerve growth factor. This chemical signal sends nerve growth into overdrive. Once these new nerves are in place, the bladder and pelvis become extremely sensitive, which the researchers say probably causes long-lasting pain and other UTI symptoms after the actual infection is gone.

[.my2]
研究人员认为，**反复的细菌感染, 可能会激活称为"肥大细胞"的特殊免疫细胞，释放一种称为"神经生长因子"的化合物。这种化学信号使神经生长过度。一旦这些新神经就位，"膀胱"和"骨盆"就会变得极其敏感，**研究人员表示，这可能会在实际感染消失后, 导致持久的疼痛和其他尿路感染症状。


The only current treatment option for a UTI is antibiotics. So when a person with a UTI has no trace of urinary tract bacteria, some clinicians tend to either downplay their reported pain or prescribe antibiotics in case urine tests might have missed remaining bacteria. But such a default measure may do more harm than good over time. Overusing antibiotics selects for bacteria that are resistant to the drugs, adding to the growing global problem of “superbugs” that are impervious to available treatments. Current approaches to chronic UTI symptoms often fail to address discomfort, but Abraham says this vicious cycle of pain may not be necessary.

[.my2]
**目前治疗"尿路感染"的唯一选择是抗生素。**因此，当患有尿路感染的人没有发现尿路细菌时，一些临床医生往往会淡化他们报告的疼痛，或者开出抗生素，以防尿检可能漏掉剩余的细菌。**但随着时间的推移，这种默认措施可能弊大于利。过度使用抗生素会选择对药物产生耐药性的细菌，**从而加剧了全球日益严重的“超级细菌”问题，这些细菌对现有的治疗方法无效。目前治疗"慢性尿路感染症状"的方法, 通常无法解决不适问题，但亚伯拉罕表示，这种疼痛的恶性循环可能没有必要。

The researchers plan further experiments to investigate whether they can stop pelvic nerve overgrowth before it takes off. Certain drugs or neutralizing antibodies may be able to block mast cells in the bladder from releasing nerve growth factor. The scientists also want to learn whether the newly overgrown nerves are permanent or whether they can be pruned back over time like wild brambles. If these solutions work, they could lead to new treatments—or even cures—that can address recurrent UTI pain when antibiotics aren’t needed and won’t help.

研究人员计划进行进一步的实验，**以研究是否可以在"骨盆神经"过度生长之前, 阻止它。某些药物或中和抗体, 可能能够阻止膀胱中的"肥大细胞"释放"神经生长因子"。**科学家们还想了解**新生长的神经, 是否是永久性的，或者是否可以像野荆棘一样随着时间的推移被修剪掉。**如果这些解决方案有效，它们可能会带来新的治疗方法，甚至是治愈方法，可以在不需要抗生素, 且无济于事的情况下, 解决"复发性尿路感染"疼痛。
