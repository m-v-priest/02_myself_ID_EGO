== How Risky Are Repeat COVID Infections? What We Know So Far 重复感染新冠病毒的风险有多大？到目前为止我们所知道的



Researchers and clinicians 临床医生 know that /people are *racking (v.) up* 累积；聚集（某物）；累计（得分） multiple infections, but the long-term consequences of _repeatedly getting (v.) the virus_ /aren’t yet clear.

研究人员和临床医生知道人们正在遭受多重感染，但反复感染该病毒的长期后果尚不清楚。

Every time you get infected with COVID, it does harm to the body in some way.
 For example, _a pulmonary 肺的 infection_ can leave scars 疤痕；创伤in the lungs /or trigger blood clots. COVID may also interfere (v.)  干涉，干扰；阻碍，妨害 with the immune system itself, he says.

Separately, `主` one study that followed up with 在…后做 participants after a flu infection /`谓` found that in about 30 percent of people, the immune system remained somewhat impaired /two months later.

**每次感染新冠病毒，都会以某种方式对身体造成伤害. 例如，肺部感染可能会在肺部留下疤痕或引发血栓。**他说，新冠病毒还可能干扰免疫系统本身。内斯指出，许多病毒的保护鞘包括可能干扰免疫系统的区域。另外，一项对感染流感的参与者进行随访的研究发现，约 30% 的人在两个月后, 免疫系统仍然受到一定程度的损害。

令人沮丧的是，*我们可能永远无法清楚地了解新冠病毒再次感染所造成的损害。确定因果关系非常具有挑战性。在两次感染之间的时间里，他们(患者)还发生了许多其他事情。*

**有些病毒可以隐藏在体内，并在初次感染数十年后出现，从而引起新的问题。**例如，引起水痘的病毒可能在多年后引发带状疱疹。科学家最近发现，感染常见的 Epstein-Barr 病毒会严重增加患自身免疫性疾病"多发性硬化症"的风险。 “我认为我们还没有看到这部电影的结局，”Al-Aly 在谈到 SARS-CoV-2 的长期影响时说道。

带状疱疹通常是因人体对"水痘带状疱疹病毒"（varicella zoster virus）（VZV）有所反应而引起。**初次感染VZV的患者, 可能会出现水痘。水痘痊愈后，病毒会潜伏（virus latency）于神经元中。**当病毒再度转为活性，便会经由神经行遍全身, 造成疹子。
