== How Risky Are Repeat COVID Infections? What We Know So Far 重复感染新冠病毒的风险有多大？到目前为止我们所知道的



Researchers and clinicians know that people are racking up multiple infections, but the long-term consequences of repeatedly getting the virus aren’t yet clear.

研究人员和临床医生知道人们正在遭受多重感染，但反复感染该病毒的长期后果尚不清楚。

Every time you get infected with COVID, it does harm to the body in some way.
 For example, a pulmonary infection can leave scars in the lungs or trigger blood clots. COVID may also interfere with the immune system itself, he says. Nath notes that the protective sheaths of many viruses include regions that can interfere with the immune system. Separately, one study that followed up with participants after a flu infection found that in about 30 percent of people, the immune system remained somewhat impaired two months later.

**每次感染新冠病毒，都会以某种方式对身体造成伤害. 例如，肺部感染可能会在肺部留下疤痕或引发血栓。**他说，新冠病毒还可能干扰免疫系统本身。内斯指出，许多病毒的保护鞘包括可能干扰免疫系统的区域。另外，一项对感染流感的参与者进行随访的研究发现，约 30% 的人在两个月后, 免疫系统仍然受到一定程度的损害。


Frustratingly, we may never have a clear sense of the damage COVID reinfections are causing.  To ascribe cause and effect is very challenging. During the span of time between infections, they’ve also had many other things happen to them, too.

令人沮丧的是，*我们可能永远无法清楚地了解新冠病毒再次感染所造成的损害。确定因果关系非常具有挑战性。在两次感染之间的时间里，他们(患者)还发生了许多其他事情。*


Some viruses can hide out in the body and emerge decades after the initial infection to cause new problems. The virus that causes chicken pox, for example, can trigger shingles many years later. And scientists have recently learned that infection with the common Epstein-Barr virus seriously increases the risk of a person developing the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis. “I don’t think we’ve seen the end of this movie yet,” Al-Aly says of SARS-CoV-2’s long-term impacts.

**有些病毒可以隐藏在体内，并在初次感染数十年后出现，从而引起新的问题。**例如，引起水痘的病毒可能在多年后引发带状疱疹。科学家最近发现，感染常见的 Epstein-Barr 病毒会严重增加患自身免疫性疾病"多发性硬化症"的风险。 “我认为我们还没有看到这部电影的结局，”Al-Aly 在谈到 SARS-CoV-2 的长期影响时说道。

Moreover, COVID has already shown its potential to cause lasting harm in the form of long COVID, which can include debilitating fatigue, breathing problems, difficulty thinking, digestive issues and a wide variety of other symptoms.

此外，新冠病毒已经显示出其以长期新冠病毒形式造成持久伤害的潜力，其中可能包括虚弱疲劳、呼吸问题、思维困难、消化问题和各种其他症状。
