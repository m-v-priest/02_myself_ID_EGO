Are there strangers in space?

`主` What does the 'uniquely rational way' for us to communicate with other intelligent beings in space `谓` depend on?

We must [underline]#conclude# from the work of those 定从 who have studied the origin of life, [underline]#that# given a planet only approximately like our own, life is almost certain to start. Of all the planets in our solar system, we are now pretty certain the Earth is the only one on which life can survive. Mars is too dry and poor(a.) in oxygen, Venus far too hot, and so is Mercury, and the outer planets have temperatures near absolute zero and hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. But other suns, start as the astronomers call them, [underline]#are bound(a.) to have# planets like our own, and 原因状 as the number of stars in the universe is so vast, this possibility becomes virtual(a.) certainty. There are *one hundred thousand million* starts in our own Milky Way alone 单单, and then there are three thousand million十亿 other Milky Ways, or galaxies, in the universe. So the number of stars that we know exist存在 is now *estimated at* about 300 million .
