== Why China’s economy won’t be fixed 为什么中国经济无法修复 (2023.8.26)


==== 困境状况

Having produced just a tenth as much as America in 1980, China’s economy is now about three-quarters the size.

.案例
====

1980年，中国的经济总量仅为美国的十分之一，而现在的经济规模约为美国的四分之三。
====


Slowing growth has also been accompanied 与…相伴 by *declining 下降，衰退 prices* and a weaker currency.

Many worry that China faces “Japanification 日本化”—a combination of debt, deflation 通货紧缩 and *demographic 人口的，人口统计的 decline* —in the long term and a “Lehman moment” in the more immediate future, as *defaults  违约 cascade* 小瀑布,倾泻；流注 through the shadow-banking system.


And, unlike Japan, China is also suffering from something more profound 巨大的；深切的；深远的 than *weak demand* and *heavy debt*. Many of its challenges stem from broader failures of its economic policymaking—which are getting worse as President Xi Jinping centralises power.



.案例
====

增长放缓, 还伴随着价格下降, 和货币贬值。

许多人担心，从长远来看，中国将面临“日本化”——债务、通货紧缩和人口下降的结合——以及在不久的将来随着影子银行体系的违约蔓延, 而面临“雷曼时刻”。

与日本不同的是，中国还面临着比需求疲软和债务沉重更严重的问题。它的许多挑战源于其经济政策制定的更广泛的失败——随着习近平主席的集权，这种失败变得更加严重。

`主` Consumer spending, business investment and exports `谓` have all *fallen short* 未达到预期目标或期望.

.案例
====

消费者支出、商业投资和出口均低于预期。

2010年代，每当经济出现波动时，官员们都会通过降低信贷价格、建设基础设施, 或刺激房地产市场, 来无视灾难的预测。然而，在每一次事件中，公共和私人债务都在增加。人们对房地产繁荣的可持续性, 以及是否真的需要新基础设施的怀疑, 也随之增加。明智的是，他们不希望出现更多白象, 或加剧房地产泡沫。
====




Given the drop in inflation 通货膨胀 in recent months, real interest rates are rising.

鉴于近几个月通胀下降，实际利率正在上升。

Policymakers are not even willing to cut interest rates much. On August 21st they disappointed investors with an underwhelming 未给人留下深刻印象的 cut of 0.1 percentage points in the one-year *lending rate* 贷款利率.

政策制定者甚至不愿意大幅降息。8 月 21 日，他们将一年期贷款利率下调了 0.1 个百分点，令投资者感到失望。

====


Weak spending on *consumer durables* 耐用品；非消耗性用品 may also reflect property-market woes (n.)痛苦；苦恼,麻烦；问题, which have depressed furniture 家具 and white-goods sales. The renewed (a.)再次发生的 weakness in China’s property market has certainly contributed to fears of deflation 通货紧缩 and default  违约（尤指未偿付债务）.

====

他们(指政府)也无法采取足够的更理想的刺激措施，例如养老金支出, 和向贫困家庭发放补贴以刺激消费，因为习近平否认“福利主义”，而且政府寻求将官方赤字, 仅占GDP的3% 。
====

Should China *fall into* persistent 执著的；不屈不挠的 deflation 通货紧缩 because the authorities *refuse to* boost consumption, *debts will rise* in real value and *weigh 有…重；重 more heavily* on the economy.

.案例
====

如果中国因当局拒绝刺激消费, 而陷入持续通货紧缩，债务的实际价值将会上升，并对经济造成更大压力。
====



==== 集权带来僵化


Why does the government keep making mistakes? One reason is that short-term growth is no longer the priority 优先事项；最重要的事 of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The signs are that Mr Xi believes China must prepare for sustained 持续的，持久 economic and, potentially, *military conflict* with America. He is willing *to make material sacrifices(n.)* to achieve (v.) those goals, and *to the extent* he wants growth, it must be “high quality”.

.案例
====

为什么政府总是犯错误？原因之一是短期增长不再是中国共产党的首要任务。有迹象表明，习认为中国必须为与美国持续的经济冲突以及潜在的军事冲突做好准备。他愿意为实现这些目标做出物质牺牲，而且他想要的增长程度必须是“高质量”。

.案例
====

2000 年代，西方领导人错误地认为贸易、市场和增长将促进民主和个人自由。但中国现在正在测试相反的关系：更多的独裁是否会损害经济。越来越多的证据表明事实确实如此.
====


The population is ageing (v.) rapidly. America is increasingly hostile (a.) 敌意的；敌对的, and is trying to choke (v.)（使）窒息，哽噎;（掐住喉咙）使停止呼吸，使窒息 the parts of China’s economy, like chipmaking, that it sees as strategically significant 有重大意义的；显著的. The more China *catches up with* America, the harder the gap will be to close further, because centralised 集中的；中央集权的 economies are better at emulation 模仿 than at innovation.

.案例
====

人口正在迅速老龄化。美国的敌意日益浓厚，并试图扼杀中国经济中具有战略意义的部分，例如芯片制造。中国越是追赶美国，进一步缩小差距就越困难，因为中央集权经济体更擅长模仿, 而不是创新。

Commodity 商品 exporters are especially exposed to China’s slowdown (n.)减速；减缓. The country guzzles (v.)暴饮；狼吞虎咽 almost a fifth of the world’s oil, half of its refined 精炼的；提纯的 copper, nickel and zinc, and more than three-fifths of its iron 铁 ore  矿石；矿砂. China’s property woes (n.)麻烦；问题；困难 will mean it requires less of such supplies. That will be a knock 敲；击 for countries such as Zambia, where exports of copper and other metals to China *amount (v.)总计；共计 to* 20% of GDP, and Australia, a big supplier of coal and iron.

.案例
====
大宗商品出口商尤其容易受到中国经济放缓的影响。该国消耗了世界近五分之一的石油，一半的精炼铜、镍和锌，以及五分之三以上的铁矿石。中国的房地产困境将意味着其对此类供应的需求减少。这将对赞比亚和澳大利亚等国家造成打击，赞比亚向中国出口的铜和其他金属, 占国内生产总值的20% ，而澳大利亚则是煤炭和铁的主要供应国。

And some Western companies are exposed through 凭借；因为；由于 their reliance on China for revenues 财政收入；税收收入；收益. In 2021 the 200 biggest multinationals in America, Europe and Japan made 13% of their sales in the country, earning $700bn. Tesla is more exposed still （加强比较级）还要，更, making around a fifth of its sales in China; Qualcomm, a chipmaker, makes a staggering (a.)令人难以相信的 two-thirds.


Sales to China *account (v.) for*  (数量、比例上) 占 only 4-8% of business for all *listed 上市的 companies* in America, Europe and Japan. Exports 出口 from America, Britain, France and Spain come to 1-2% of their respective outputs. Even in Germany, with an export share of nearly 4%, China would have to collapse *in order to* generate a sizeable 相当大的 hit (n.) to its economy.

.案例
====

一些西方公司因收入依赖中国而面临风险。2021年，美国、欧洲和日本最大的200家跨国公司13%的销售额来自中国，收入达7000亿美元。特斯拉面临的风险更大，其销量的约五分之一来自中国；芯片制造商高通的收入达到惊人的三分之二。

在美国、欧洲和日本的所有上市公司中，对中国的销售仅占其业务的4-8%。美国、英国、法国和西班牙的出口占各自产量的1-2%。即使在出口份额接近 4% 的德国，中国也必须崩溃才能对其经济造成相当大的打击。

Slowing growth has also been accompanied by declining prices and a weaker currency.




Many worry that China faces “Japanification”—a combination of debt, deflation and demographic decline—in the long term and a “Lehman moment” in the more immediate future, as defaults cascade through the shadow-banking system.

And, unlike Japan, China is also suffering from something more profound than weak demand and heavy debt. Many of its challenges stem from broader failures of its economic policymaking—which are getting worse as President Xi Jinping centralises power.




Consumer spending, business investment and exports have all fallen short.

Foreign direct investment all but vanished in the second quarter, falling by 87% year-on-year to $4.9bn, as multinationals repatriated their earnings rather than reinvesting them.



==== 出口


==== 消费者支出




Households may be despondent because employment is insecure, wages are stagnant and assets, especially houses, are losing value.


Weak spending on consumer durables may also reflect property-market woes, which have depressed furniture and white-goods sales. The renewed weakness in China’s property market has certainly contributed to fears of deflation and default.

The price of building materials fell by 5.6% in July compared with a year earlier, and the price of household appliances fell by 1.8%.







Nor can they do enough of the more desirable kinds of stimulus, such as pension spending and handouts to poor households to boost consumption, because Mr Xi has disavowed “welfarism” and the government seeks an official deficit of only 3% of GDP.


Should China fall into persistent deflation because the authorities refuse to boost consumption, debts will rise in real value and weigh more heavily on the economy.



==== 集权带来僵化


Why does the government keep making mistakes? One reason is that short-term growth is no longer the priority of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The signs are that Mr Xi believes China must prepare for sustained economic and, potentially, military conflict with America. He is willing to make material sacrifices to achieve those goals, and to the extent he wants growth, it must be “high quality”.


Decisions are increasingly governed by an ideology that fuses a left-wing suspicion of rich entrepreneurs with a right-wing reluctance to hand money to the idle poor.


In the 2000s Western leaders mistakenly believed that trade, markets and growth would boost democracy and individual liberty. But China is now testing the reverse relationship: whether more autocracy damages the economy. The evidence is mounting that it does.


The population is ageing rapidly. America is increasingly hostile, and is trying to choke the parts of China’s economy, like chipmaking, that it sees as strategically significant. The more China catches up with America, the harder the gap will be to close further, because centralised economies are better at emulation than at innovation.



==== What China’s economic troubles mean for the world


Commodity exporters are especially exposed to China’s slowdown. The country guzzles almost a fifth of the world’s oil, half of its refined copper, nickel and zinc, and more than three-fifths of its iron ore. China’s property woes will mean it requires less of such supplies. That will be a knock for countries such as Zambia, where exports of copper and other metals to China amount to 20% of GDP, and Australia, a big supplier of coal and iron.

And some Western companies are exposed through their reliance on China for revenues. In 2021 the 200 biggest multinationals in America, Europe and Japan made 13% of their sales in the country, earning $700bn. Tesla is more exposed still, making around a fifth of its sales in China; Qualcomm, a chipmaker, makes a staggering two-thirds.

Sales to China account for only 4-8% of business for all listed companies in America, Europe and Japan. Exports from America, Britain, France and Spain come to 1-2% of their respective outputs. Even in Germany, with an export share of nearly 4%, China would have to collapse in order to generate a sizeable hit to its economy.
