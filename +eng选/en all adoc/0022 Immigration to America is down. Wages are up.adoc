尽管如此，仍有零星的证据表明，美国人对移民们日益增长的反感, 给一些工人带来了好处. 哈佛大学(Harvard University)的戈登•汉森(Gordon Hanson)认为，低技能移民的数量减少, 其影响, 在三个特定的职业中表现最突出: 即, 管家、建筑与地面维护工人, 和干墙安装工. 因为这些工作严重依赖外来的移民劳工，他们所提供的服务, 是无法通过国际贸易来进口的。根据《经济学人》的计算，这些职业的平均工资增长速度, 要比其他低薪工作快得多。

短期内明显的工资增长, 可能会鼓励政客们走得更远。受到总统法案的鼓舞，一些共和党参议员, 正在推动将移民人数削减一半，他们说，这样做, 是为了提高工人的工资。但是最近发表的几篇学术论文指出，当美国限制移民时，这些事件最终对本国工人没有什么好处，甚至可能伤害他们。

The lesson from all these papers is that, over time 随着时间的过去, 久而久之, the economy *adjusts to* a fall in the number of immigrants.

In the short term, native workers *may well*  有充分理由；合理地 see a wage boost 当 as *labour supply* falls.

But businesses then [underline]#reorient# (v.)重定向;重新确定方向 production [underline]#towards# *less labour-intensive* products; 主 natives 谓 take jobs (previously *occupied by* foreign-born folk), which *may be* worse paid; and 主 bosses 谓 *invest in* labour-saving 节省劳力的 machinery, which can reduce the pay of remaining workers.

从所有这些论文中得出的教训是，随着时间的推移，经济会逐渐适应移民数量的下降。短期内，随着劳动力供应下降，本地工人很可能会得到工资上涨。但随后, 企业会重新调整生产方向，转向劳动密集型程度较低的生产上; 以前是由外国移民所做的工作, 现在由当地人来做, 但薪水可能变得更低; 而且在老板们转而投资于节省劳动力的机器后, 国内剩下的工人, 其工资也会被降低。
