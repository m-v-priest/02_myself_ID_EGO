==   What a museum of disgusting food reveals about human nature



When people recognise that disgust *depends [in part] on* upbringing (a.) 抚育；养育；培养, they can learn to overcome it, at least some of the time.

Not only 主 do “immoral” things 谓 disgust people; sometimes, disgust can affect their moral judgments.

In one experiment, Thalia Wheatley of the National *Institutes of Health* 国立卫生研究院 and Jonathan Haidt of the University of Virginia took a group of people *who were susceptible (a.)易受影响（或伤害等）；敏感；过敏) to* hypnosis 催眠状态.

*They were hypnotised (v.)对（某人）施催眠术 to feel* a brief pang (n.)突然的疼痛（或痛苦）；一阵剧痛) of disgust [when they read an everyday 每天的；每日发生的；日常的 word, either “take” or “often”].

Then they read accounts (n.)描述；叙述；报告 of theft, bribery (n.)行贿；受贿 or incest (n.)乱伦；血亲相奸, and were asked how morally outrageous (a.)骇人的；无法容忍的 they thought each incident was.

When *an account 描述；叙述；报告 of* an offence(n.)违法行为；犯罪；罪行 included one of the words that triggered disgust, the participants *condemned (v.) it more severely*.

Other experiments have shown that 主 people who are easily disgusted 谓 *make harsher moral judgments* [when subjected (v.)使经受；使遭受 to *disgusting 极糟的；令人不快的 stimuli* 刺激物, such as *a sticky 黏（性）的 desk* or *foul 肮脏恶臭的；难闻的 smells*].

.hypnosis
/hɪp-ˈnoʊ-sɪs/
⇒ hypno-,睡觉，催眠，-osis,情况，疾病征兆。引申词义催眠，催眠状态。许普诺斯（Hypnos）是希腊神话中的睡神.

.outrageous
⇒ 来自outrage,愤怒，愤慨。
当人们意识到, "厌恶感"在某种程度上取决于你从小受过什么教育时，他们可以尝试学会克服它，至少在某些时候是这样。

.incest
-> in-,不，非，-cest,纯的，词源同caste,castrate.即不纯洁的，引申词义乱伦。

不但做“不道德”的事, 会令人厌恶;有时，厌恶的感观感觉, 也会影响他们的道德判断。

在一项实验中，美国国立卫生研究院的Thalia Wheatley和弗吉尼亚大学的Jonathan Haidt, 对一组容易受到催眠影响的人, 进行了研究。他们在被催眠后，就让他们阅读每一个日常的普通单词, 比如“take” 或 “often”, 同时, 给他们施加一阵令人会产生厌恶感的短暂刺激. 之后, 就给他们阅读关于盗窃、贿赂或乱伦的报道，并询问他们, 这每一个有罪的行为, 令他们有多无法容忍? 结果证明, 当报道中含有会令人引起厌恶的用词时, 被试者就会更加严厉地谴责它。

其他的实验表明，容易感到厌恶感的人, 在受到令人作呕的刺激时，比如黏糊糊的桌子, 或难闻的气味时，会做出更严厉的道德判断。

Another finding is that 主 people who are more easily disgusted 系 *are more likely(a.) to be* socially conservative (a.)保守的.

A study by Xiaowen Xu of the College of William and Mary 威廉与玛丽学院 in Virginia and others *found evidence that* “disgust-sensitive people [underline]#extend# (v.) their preference (n.) for order 秩序;条理 (in the physical environment (eg, tidying up 使整洁；使整齐 ；使有条理；整理 one’s room)) [underline]#to# *the sociopolitical 社会政治的 environment* (eg, strengthening (v.) *traditional norms*).”

Woo-Young Ahn of Virginia Tech 弗吉尼亚理工大学 and others found that by scanning (v.) *brain responses* to a single disgusting image (such as *a mutilated 使残废；使残缺不全；毁伤) body*, they could *make accurate predictions about* a subject’s  接受试验者；实验对象 *political ideology*  意识形态；观念形态.

主 People *who are highly sensitive to disgust* 系 are especially likely to oppose (v.)反对（计划、政策等）；抵制；阻挠 immigration 外来移民. This is true *even after* controlling for education, income and political ideology.

.the College of William and Mary :
威廉与玛丽学院. 是美国历史第二悠久的高等院校(1693年)，建校时间仅次于1636年建立的哈佛大学。

.mutilate
⇒ 来自拉丁语mutilus,使残的，可能来自PIE*mai,砍，切，词源同 maim, mangle. 引申词义使残废。

另一项发现是，更容易会产生恶心感的人, 也更有可能是社会保守主义者。弗吉尼亚的威廉与玛丽学院的 Xiaowen Xu 等人研究发现，有证据表明，“对厌恶感敏感的人, 会将他们对物理环境中的秩序(如整理房间)的偏好, 延伸到社会的政治环境上(如强化传统规范)。” 弗吉尼亚理工大学的 Woo-Young Ahn 等人发现，通过扫描大脑对单独的恶心图像(比如残损的身体)所作出的反应，他们可以准确预测一个被试的政治意识形态。

那些最容易产生(具有敏感性)厌恶感的人, 尤其可能反对移民。即使将他们的教育、收入, 和政治意识形态考虑在内，也是如此。

Another finding is that 主 people who are more easily disgusted 系 are more likely  表 to be socially conservative. A study by Xiaowen Xu of the College of William and Mary in Virginia and others found evidence that “disgust-sensitive people extend their preference for order in the physical environment (eg, tidying up one’s room) to the sociopolitical environment (eg, strengthening traditional norms).” Woo-Young Ahn of Virginia Tech and others found that by scanning brain responses to a single disgusting image (such as a mutilated body), they could make accurate predictions about a subject’s political ideology.

People who are highly sensitive to disgust are especially likely to oppose immigration. This is true even after controlling for education, income and political ideology.
