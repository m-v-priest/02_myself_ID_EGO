== Back pain is a massive problem which is badly treated


Doctors *used to think that* back pain *was almost entirely the result of* mechanical damage to tissue beyond the capacity of X-rays to detect.

The advent of *MRI scans* showed {this was not true}. A definitive (a.)最后的；决定性的；不可更改的 *physical cause* — such as a fracture, a tumour 肿瘤；肿块, *pressure on a nerve*, infection or arthritis 关节炎 — is found in 5-15% of people with back pain.

The rest  剩余部分；残留；其余 *is all labelled (v.)贴标签于；用标签标明 as “non-specific”* 不明确的；非特定的；泛泛的; 不止一种病因的；有多种致病可能的, and there is increasing evidence that it is not mechanical *in origin*.

.mechanical damage :
机械损伤. 是指人体同某种致伤物接触，因机械运动作用, 所造成的机体正常组织的破坏, 或器官的机能性障碍。可分为钝器伤、锐器伤、枪弹伤、火器伤等类。机械性损伤的基本征象有: 表皮剥脱、皮下出血、创伤、骨折、内脏破裂, 肢体断离, 六种。

.non-specific :
a. not definite or clearly defined; general 不明确的；非特定的；泛泛的
→ The candidate’s speech was non-specific. 这位候选人的讲话只是泛泛之谈。

医生们过去认为，背部疼痛几乎完全是组织受到机械损伤的结果，超出了x光检测的能力。核磁共振扫描的出现, 表明事实并非如此。5-15%的背痛患者, 都有明确的生理原因，如骨折、肿瘤、神经压迫、感染或关节炎。其余的都被贴上了“非单一原因导致的”的标签，而且越来越多的证据表明, 机械损伤并非是它的病因。

Some sufferers  *catastrophise (v.)小题大做，把事情复杂化 the news into the idea that* they have a broken, fragile back and  start avoiding normal physical activity — *not least* 特别；尤其, says Ms Knight of St Thomas’, because doctors *often fail to explain to them ① that* {abnormalities (n.)身体、行为等不正常，反常  are, in fact, quite normal}, and ② *that* {degeneration 蜕化；衰退**can basically 总的说来；从根本上说 be** wear and tear 损耗}.

exercise daily;  *[underline]#accept# flare-ups(n.)疾病突发；（尤指）复发 [underline]#as# temporary setbacks*(n.)挫折；阻碍;  *don’t get fixated (a.) on* （对…）异常依恋，固恋 the pain.

The programme, explains Ms Knight, aims [underline]#not# *to reduce pain* [underline]#so much as# *to add to life*.


*In a typical class* of ten people, Ms Knight says, one or two *decide that* the approach *is not what they want*, and may *drop out* 不再参加；退出；脱离. Most of them *take away at least some skills* which add to their *quality of life*. One or two, like Mr Moore, find the programme life-changing(a.)改变人生的.

.wear and tear
损耗,磨损

.not A so much as B / not so much A as B :
与其说A, 倒不如说B / 是B,而不是A. 即, 轻前, 重后 +
A和B是两个被比较的平行结构，如同为介词短语、动词不定式、名词短语或其他平行结构。

- Science moves forward, they say, *not so much* through the insights of great men of genius *as* because of more ordinary things like improved techniques and tools.
他们说，科学的发展**与其说**源于天才伟人的真知灼见，**不如说**源于改进了的技术和工具等更为普通的东西。

- The great use of a school education is *not so much* to teach you things *as* to teach you the art of learning.
学校教育的伟大作用不在于教会你多少东西，而在于教会你学习的技巧。

一些患者将他们从扫描中看到的信息, 小题大做, 以为他们有了一个骨折的, 脆弱的背部，并开始避免正常的身体活动，尤其是, 因为医生经常未能向他们解释，这种异常, 实际上是很正常的，身体机能的退化, 基本上源于年龄所导致的身体器官的磨损。而你如果不活动的话, 带来的肌肉僵硬和身体虚弱, 反而往往会令情况变得更糟。

每天锻炼；将突发的疾病, 视为是暂时的挫折；不要专注于疼痛。奈特女士解释说，这个项目的目的, 与其说是减轻病痛，不如说是为了增加生命的质量。

在一个典型的有十人的班级里，会有一两个病友认为这种方式不是他们想要的，而可能退出。但班里的大多数人, 至少会学到一些机能, 能给他们的生活质量带来提高。班里会有一两个人, 就像摩尔先生一样，会发现这个项目能改变他们的人生。
