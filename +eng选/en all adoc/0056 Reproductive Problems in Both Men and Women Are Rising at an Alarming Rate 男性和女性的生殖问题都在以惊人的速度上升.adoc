在西方国家，男性的整个生殖问题范围每年增加约 1%。这种“1% 的影响”包括精子数量下降、睾丸激素水平下降和睾丸癌发病率上升，以及勃起功能障碍患病率上升。在等式的女性方面，美国的流产率也在以每年约 1% 的速度增长，代孕率也是如此。与此同时，从 1960 年到 2018 年，全球总生育率每年下降近 1%。

怀孕期间接触这些化学物质, 尤其成问题，因为怀孕期间发生的事情, 其影响不会只留在怀孕期间。相反，准妈妈接触到她呼吸的空气、喝的水、吃的食物, 和涂在皮肤上的产品中的有毒化学物质, 会进入她的身体（进而影响胎儿），并影响婴儿的生殖发育。这在怀孕早期尤其如此 ——在所谓的生殖编程窗口 ——对男婴来说尤其如此。

睾丸在正常发育过程中, 会从腰部腹膜后, 下降至阴囊. 如果没有出现下降, 或下降不全，阴囊内没有睾丸, 或只有一侧有睾丸，称之为"隐睾症". 临床上也称为"睾丸下降不全"或"睾丸未降"。 +
"隐睾"是小儿泌尿生殖系最常见的先天畸形之一，多表现为单侧，并以右侧未降为主，约15%为双侧。早产儿发病率约为30%，健康新生儿约为3%，3月时约为1%。 +
**"隐睾"时, 因睾丸长期留在腹腔内或腹股沟管里，受体内“高温”的影响，容易造成男性不育。** +

**"尿道下裂"是一种男性尿道开口位置异常的先天缺陷 **，尿道口可分布在正常尿道口至会阴部的连线上，多数病人可伴有阴茎向腹侧弯曲。尿道下裂是小儿泌尿系统中的常见畸形，国外报道发病率可高达125～250出生男婴中有1个尿道下裂。 +



例如，如果一名妇女在怀孕的前三个月, 接触到阻断雄激素作用的化学物质，这可能会以多种方式影响男性胎儿的生殖发育。它会导致肛门生殖器距离 (AGD) 缩短，即从肛门到阴茎根部的跨度，这很重要，因为研究表明，较短的 AGD 与较小的阴茎相关，而在成人中，较低的精子数量。此外，男性荷尔蒙系统的产前紊乱, 会导致睾丸激素水平降低，并增加男婴出生时"睾丸未降（隐睾症）"或"特定类型畸形阴茎（尿道下裂）"的风险。如果一个男孩天生就有这些生殖器缺陷，他成年后患精子数量少和睾丸癌的风险, 就会增加。

"代谢"通常被分为两类：

- "分解代谢" : 可以对大的分子进行分解以获得能量（如细胞呼吸）；
- "合成代谢": 则可以利用能量来合成细胞中的各个组分，如蛋白质和核酸等。

代谢可以被认为是生物体不断进行物质和能量交换的过程，一旦物质和能量的交换停止，生物体的结构就会解体。


但内分泌失调, 也是自身免疫性疾病发病率上升, 以及肥胖和"代谢综合征"（一组增加心脏病、中风, 和 "2型糖尿病"风险的疾病）流行的罪魁祸首。其中, 一些生殖影响甚至与"早产死亡"风险增加有关。

== Reproductive Problems in Both Men and Women Are Rising at an Alarming Rate

The whole spectrum of reproductive problems in males are increasing by about 1 percent per year in Western countries. This “1 percent effect” includes the rates of declining sperm counts, decreasing testosterone levels and increasing rates of testicular cancer, as well as a rise in the prevalence of erectile dysfunction. On the female side of the equation, miscarriage rates are also increasing by about 1 percent per year in the U.S., and so is the rate of gestational surrogacy. Meanwhile, the total fertility rate worldwide has dropped by nearly 1 percent per year from 1960 to 2018.


It is a huge deal! It adds up to more than 10 percent per decade and more than 50 percent over 50 years. When you consider that sperm counts declined by 50 percent in just 40 years, ...

The annual 1 percent decline in reproductive health is faster than the rate of global warming. To put the 1 percent effect in perspective, consider this: scientific data show a 1.1 percent per year increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder between 2000 and 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

They’re just too synchronous for that to be possible. The truth is, these reproductive health effects are interconnected, and they are largely driven by a common cause: the presence of hormone-altering chemicals (a.k.a., endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs) in our world. These hormone-hijacking chemicals, which include phthalates, bisphenol A, and flame retardants, among others, have become ubiquitous in modern life. They’re in water bottles and food packaging, electronic devices, personal-care products, cleaning supplies and many other items we use regularly. And they began being produced in increasing numbers after 1950, when sperm counts and fertility began their decline.



Exposure to these chemicals is especially problematic during pregnancy because what happens during pregnancy doesn’t stay in pregnancy. Rather, an expectant mother’s exposure to toxic chemicals in the air she breathes, the water she drinks, the foods she eats and the products she slathers on her skin can enter her body (and hence the fetus) and influence her baby’s reproductive development. This is particularly true early in pregnancy—in what’s called the reproductive programming window—and it’s especially true for male babies.

For example, if a woman is exposed to chemicals that block the action of androgens during the first trimester of pregnancy, this can affect the reproductive development of the male fetus in numerous ways. It can result in a shortening of the anogenital distance (AGD), the span from the anus to the base of the penis, which is significant because research has shown that a shorter AGD correlates with a smaller penis and, in the adult, a lower sperm count. In addition, prenatal disruption of the male hormonal system can result in reduced testosterone levels and increase the risk that a baby boy will have undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) or a particular type of malformed penis (hypospadias) at birth. And if a boy is born with these genital defects, he will have an increased risk of low sperm count and testicular cancer as an adult.

But endocrine disruption is also a culprit in rising rates of autoimmune disorders as well as the growing epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes). Some of these reproductive effects are even associated with an increased risk of premature death.

It’s time for us to make it a priority to demand that endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the everyday products are replaced with chemicals that don’t affect our hormones and don’t persist in the environment.
