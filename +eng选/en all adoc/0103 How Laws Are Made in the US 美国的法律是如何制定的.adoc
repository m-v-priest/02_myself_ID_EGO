== How Laws Are Made in the US 美国的法律是如何制定的


The United States Congress 国会，议会 is responsible for making and approving (v.)批准，通过（计划、要求等） federal laws – rules that everyone in the country must follow. But exactly how do those laws get made? The process is not easy, and it takes a long time.

.案例
====

美国国会负责制定和批准联邦法律——该国每个人都必须遵守的规则。但这些法律到底是如何制定的呢？这个过程并不容易，而且需要很长时间。
====

A law begins when someone proposes (v.) an idea. The idea can come from anyone, but it has to get to a U.S. lawmaker who wants it to become legislation. In time, the idea is further developed into a written proposal, called a bill （提交议会讨论的）议案，法案.

Then, a member of Congress – that is, a senator or a member of the House of Representatives – officially proposes the bill. In other words, a lawmaker sponsors (v.)赞助（活动、节目等）,举办；促成;倡议，提交（法案等） it. Lawmakers usually sponsor (v.) bills that are important to them or the people who live in the area they represent.

.案例
====

当有人提出一个想法时，法律就开始了。这个想法可以来自任何人，但必须提交给希望其成为立法的美国立法者。随着时间的推移，这个想法被进一步发展成书面提案，称为法案。

然后，国会议员（即参议员或众议院议员）正式提出该法案。换句话说，立法者支持它。立法者通常会提出"对他们或他们所代表地区的居民重要的"法案。
====

After the bill is introduced 把…介绍（给）；引见；（自我）介绍, it is sent to a small group of lawmakers, called a “committee.” Committees are responsible for a specific public policy or area of government. For example, both the Senate and the House have committees that deal with agriculture, education, and international relations.

.案例
====

该法案提出后，会被发送给一小群立法者，称为“委员会”。委员会负责特定的公共政策或政府领域。例如，参议院和众议院都有委员会, 来处理农业、教育和国际关系。
====

Sometimes committee members seek (v.) more information about the proposal by holding hearings 听证会. Sometimes the committee changes the bill. Sometimes it decides not to take any action. In that case, we say lawmakers “table” (v.)（将主意、建议等）搁置 the bill, or let it “die in committee.”

But *now and then* 偶尔，有时候, they offer the bill to lawmakers not on the committee. Those lawmakers debate the bill further. They might change the bill again.

Finally, the full House or Senate votes (v.) on the bill. If it does not earn the majority of votes, the bill does not advance 促进；推动.

But if it does get approved, the bill goes to the other chamber of Congress. So, `主` bills approved by the House `谓`  go to the Senate; `主` bills approved by the Senate `谓` go to the House.


Lawmakers in the second chamber repeat the process. If the second chamber also approves the bill, lawmakers from both the House and the Senate may have to discuss it again to settle any differences.


.案例
====

有时，委员会成员通过举行听证会, 来寻求有关提案的更多信息。有时委员会会更改法案。有时它决定不采取任何行动。在这种情况下，我们说立法者“搁置”该法案，或者让它“在委员会中夭折”。

但他们有时会向委员会以外的立法者, 提出该法案。这些立法者进一步辩论该法案。他们可能会再次更改法案。

最后，众议院或参议院全体议员对该法案进行投票。如果没有获得多数选票，该法案就不会获得推进。

但如果它确实获得批准，该法案将被提交给国会的另一个议院。因此，众议院批准的法案将提交参议院；参议院批准的法案进入众议院。

第二议院的立法者重复这个过程。如果第二院也批准该法案，众议院和参议院的立法者可能不得不再次讨论以解决任何分歧。

====

Finally, the agreed-upon 达成一致的 bill is sent to the president. The president has a few choices about what to do.

If the president signs it, the bill becomes a law.

If the president does nothing and Congress is officially meeting, the bill becomes a law.

But if the president does nothing and Congress is not in session （法庭的）开庭，开庭期；（议会等的）会议，会期, the bill does not pass.

Or the president can officially reject – or veto (v.)拒不接受；反对；否定 – the bill. If that happens, the bill is not stopped. Instead, it is returned to both the Senate and the House.

.案例
====
.session
(n.) a formal meeting or series of meetings of a court, a parliament, etc.; a period of time when such meetings are held （法庭的）开庭，开庭期；（议会等的）会议，会期 +
• a session of the UN General Assembly 一届联合国大会 +
• The court is now in session . 法庭现在正在开庭。

最后，商定的法案被送交总统。总统对于做什么有几个选择。 +
如果总统签署，该法案就成为法律。 +
如果总统不采取任何行动, 并且国会正式开会，该法案将成为法律。 +
但如果总统不采取任何行动, 并且国会没有开会，该法案就不会通过。 +
或者总统可以正式拒绝或否决该法案。如果发生这种情况，该法案不会停止。相反，它会同时返回参议院和众议院。
====

If two-thirds of the senators and two-thirds of the House members approve the bill once again, they override the veto. That is, even with the president objecting 反对, they turn the bill into a law.

.案例
====

如果三分之二的参议员和三分之二的众议院议员再次批准该法案，他们就会推翻否决。也就是说，即使总统反对，他们也会将该法案变成法律。
