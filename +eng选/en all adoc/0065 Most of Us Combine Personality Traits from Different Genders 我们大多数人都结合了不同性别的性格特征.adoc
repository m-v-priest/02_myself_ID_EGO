== Most of Us Combine (v.)（使）结合，组合 Personality Traits 特性，特质，性格 from Different Genders 我们大多数人, 都结合了不同性别的性格特征

How different are men and women really?

For example, `主` a study involving more than 300,000 people in the U.S. /who *self-identified (v.)自我鉴定的,自认为的 as* either male or female /`谓` looked *both* at broad *personality traits*, such as extraversion
外向性；外倾性 *and* agreeableness 亲和性,宜人性, and at more *specific aspects* of these traits, such as *a warm communication style* /or a tendency *to act altruistically* 利他地；无私地. In this sample, researchers found moderate differences /between male and female participants /in the broad traits but, in most cases, larger differences at the more specific 明确的；具体的, 特定的 level.

Overall, for instance, both male and female people in the study /were similarly extraverted 外向的  (a broad trait). When the scientists looked at specific aspects of extraversion, however, they found that /male participants, on average, *sought out* exciting situations /*more often than* female ones did. And female participants demonstrated (v.)表现；显露 higher activity levels than male ones.

男人和女人到底有多大区别？

例如，一项针对美国超过 300,000 名自认为男性或女性的人的研究，不仅考察了广泛的人格特征，例如外向性和随和性，还考察了这些特征的更具体方面，例如热情的沟通方式或倾向于利他行为。在这个样本中，研究人员发现男性和女性参与者在广泛特征上存在适度差异，但在大多数情况下，在更具体的层面上存在较大差异。总体而言，例如，研究中的男性和女性都具有相似的外向性（一个广泛的特征）。然而，当科学家研究外向性的具体方面时，他们发现，平均而言，男性参与者比女性参与者更频繁地寻找令人兴奋的情况。女性参与者表现出比男性参与者更高的活动水平。

To create the questions for our studies, we cast 扔；掷；抛 a very wide net, looking at large personality projects, reviewing 评审，审查,检阅 the academic literature  （某学科的）文献，著作，资料 and crowdsourcing (v.)众包; (尤指利用互联网)将工作分配给不特定人群 ideas. We *ended up* 最终 testing (v.) more than 600 personality questions for gender differences /before identifying the 18 traits with the greatest variation （数量、水平等的）变化，变更，变异 /between the self-identified men and women in our sample.

These traits included *not only* the broad characteristics 特性，特征；特色 that are widely used (v.) in psychological research (such as extraversion and agreeableness) /*but also* more specific patterns of thought and behavior, such as how frequently an individual *takes risks* /or their degree of *focus on* aesthetics 美学；美学理论. We also double-checked (v.)将……仔细检查，复核 our conclusions /by running a final study to replicate 复制；（精确地）仿制,再造 the major findings. Ultimately  最终；最后；终归 we found no large differences in personality between cisgender 顺性别 men and women on any traits. But we did find small and moderate differences /in the 18 personality traits.

为了提出我们的研究问题，我们撒了一张非常广泛的网，研究大型人格项目，回顾学术文献和众包想法。我们最终测试了 600 多个关于性别差异的性格问题，然后确定了我们样本中自我认同的男性和女性之间差异最大的 18 个特征。这些特征不仅包括心理学研究中广泛使用的广泛特征（例如外向性和宜人性），还包括更具体的思维和行为模式，例如个人冒险的频率或他们对美学的关注程度。我们还通过运行最终研究来复现主要发现，从而对我们的结论进行了双重检查。最终，我们发现顺性别男性和女性在任何特征上的性格都没有太大差异。但我们确实发现了 18 种性格特征的细微差别。

`主` The most sizable 相当大的，颇大的 of these differences `系`  was the degree /to which cisgender people *thought about* sex, assessed by asking people to rate (v.) how much they agreed with the statement “I often have sexual thoughts /when I meet an attractive-looking person” /and disagreed with the statement “I do not frequently think about sex.” (This “sex-focused” characteristic, while 尽管，虽然 *not linked to* major personality traits /commonly studied in psychology, nonetheless  然而，尽管如此 fits (v.) the conception of a personality trait /as a pattern in thought, emotion or behavior. It also *relates to* a concept called sexual preoccupation 盘算；思虑；长久思考的事情.) We found that /gender could explain about 18 percent of the variation *in the extent*  程度；限度 /to which people are sex-focused. Men *had a higher average score* on this trait *than* women. There were still plenty of women /who had a higher score than most men, however. In other words, individual men and women were highly varied 各种各样的；形形色色的；不相同的, *even though* at the group level, men tended to differ from women.

.标题
====

这些差异中最大的差异是顺性别者对性的思考程度，通过要求人们评价他们对“当我遇到一个有吸引力的人时我经常有性想法”这一说法的同意程度和不同意该说法的程度来评估“我不经常想到性。” （这种“以性为中心”的特征，虽然与心理学中普遍研究的主要人格特质无关，但符合人格特质作为思想、情感或行为模式的概念。它也与一个叫做性关注的概念有关。）我们发现，性别可以解释大约 18% 的人们对性的关注程度的差异。男性在这一特征上的平均得分高于女性。然而，仍然有很多女性的得分高于大多数男性。换句话说，尽管在群体层面上，男性往往与女性有所不同，但男性和女性个体差异很大。
====



On every trait, there was *a substantial 大量的；价值巨大的；重大的 overlap* （范围方面的）重叠部分 between men and women. Yet at the tail 尾巴 ends —where people *either* strongly agreed *or* disagreed with the questions we asked them —larger differences emerged. For example, very low compassion 同情；怜悯 was rare /in both men and women, but the few people who identified as very uncompassionate 冷酷无情的；无同情心的 /were *much more likely to be* men. This result is *consistent (a.)与…一致的；相符的,不矛盾的 with* the finding /that `主` antisocial 反社会的；危害社会的；令人讨厌的 personality disorder, which often involves a lack of remorse 懊悔；非常遗憾；自责 or empathy, `系`  is more common among men than women.

.标题
====

在每一个特征上，男性和女性之间都有很大的重叠。然而，在最后阶段——人们要么强烈同意，要么不同意我们提出的问题——出现了更大的分歧。例如，非常低的同情心在男性和女性中都很少见，但少数被认为非常没有同情心的人更有可能是男性。这一结果与以下发现一致，即反社会人格障碍通常涉及缺乏悔恨或同理心，男性比女性更常见。
====

So /is there a “man's personality” and a “woman's personality”? Fascinatingly 极有吸引力地；迷人地, almost everyone in our study /was a mix of “more often seen in men” and “more often seen in women” traits. For any given trait, an individual woman was closer to the overall average for women /than the overall average for men /just 61 percent of the time. And a man was closer to the average for men /than the average for women /only 57 percent of the time. Only about 1 percent of men and 1 percent of women /had almost entirely  全部地；完整地；完全地 “more often seen in men” or “more often seen in women” personality traits.

那么到底有没有“男人的性格”和“女人的性格”呢？令人着迷的是，我们研究中的几乎每个人都具有“男性更常见”和“女性更常见”特征的混合体。对于任何给定的特征，女性个体在 61% 的情况下更接近女性的总体平均值，而不是男性的总体平均值。而且，只有 57% 的情况下，男性比女性平均水平更接近男性平均水平。只有大约 1% 的男性和 1% 的女性拥有几乎完全“更常见于男性”或“更常见于女性”的人格特质。

To test (v.) how accurately 精确地，准确地 gender *can be predicted from* personality, we developed a simple machine-learning algorithm (a computer program /that *looked for* patterns in data /regarding （尤指以某种方式）注视，凝视 which personality traits are *associated 有关联的；相关的 with* being a cis 同侧的，顺式的 man or a cis woman). We trained our algorithm /using results from past study participants 参加者，参与者, then presented 把…交给；颁发；授予 the algorithm with the personality traits of new participants /to see how well it could predict their gender. Using just the most predictive trait — being sex-focused —the algorithm could predict a person's gender correctly 69 percent of the time. This result may be impressive 令人赞叹的；令人敬佩的 to some. But the prediction is *far from* 远离,远远不是  perfect /because some women are much more sex-focused than the average man.

为了测试"从性格中预测性别"的准确程度，我们开发了一种简单的机器学习算法（一种计算机程序，用于在数据中寻找与顺式男性或顺式女性相关的人格特征模式）。我们使用过去研究参与者的结果, 来训练我们的算法，然后向算法展示新参与者的性格特征，看看它能多好地预测他们的性别。仅使用"最具预测性的特征"（以性别为中心），该算法就可以在 69% 的情况下正确预测一个人的性别。这个结果可能会让一些人印象深刻。但这一预测远非完美，因为有些女性比普通男性更注重性。

The algorithm's accuracy rose to 78 percent /when we allowed it to incorporate  将…包括在内；包含；吸收；使并入 all the personality differences at once. That's a big improvement —but for the other 22 percent of people, the algorithm was predicting incorrectly. When we *released* our quiz 小测验 *to* the public, accuracy slipped a bit further （空间距离）较远，更远 to 74 percent. That's still much better than the average human, though: We *gave* another group of study participants *sets of* personality traits that, we explained, belonged to particular individuals. Then we asked the participants to predict the gender of those other people /using the personality traits. They were correct only 58 percent of the time, hardly better than a coin flip. The quiz is called the Gender Continuum （相邻两者相似但起首与末尾截然不同的）连续体 Test, and you can try it yourself on our Web site /to see whether the algorithm predicts your gender.

当我们允许它同时包含所有性格差异时，该算法的准确率上升到 78%。这是一个很大的进步——但对于其他 22% 的人来说，算法预测不正确。当我们向公众发布测验时，准确率进一步下滑至 74%。不过，这仍然比普通人要好得多：我们向另一组研究参与者提供了一组人格特征，我们解释说，这些特征属于特定个体。然后我们要求参与者使用人格特征预测其他人的性别。他们只有 58% 的时间是正确的，几乎不比抛硬币好。该测验称为性别连续体测试，您可以在我们的网站上亲自尝试一下，看看该算法是否可以预测您的性别。

== Most of Us Combine Personality Traits from Different Genders


How different are men and women really?

For example, a study involving more than 300,000 people in the U.S. who self-identified as either male or female looked both at broad personality traits, such as extraversion and agreeableness, and at more specific aspects of these traits, such as a warm communication style or a tendency to act altruistically. In this sample, researchers found moderate differences between male and female participants in the broad traits but, in most cases, larger differences at the more specific level. Overall, for instance, both male and female people in the study were similarly extraverted (a broad trait). When the scientists looked at specific aspects of extraversion, however, they found that male participants, on average, sought out exciting situations more often than female ones did. And female participants demonstrated higher activity levels than male ones.


To create the questions for our studies, we cast a very wide net, looking at large personality projects, reviewing the academic literature and crowdsourcing ideas. We ended up testing more than 600 personality questions for gender differences before identifying the 18 traits with the greatest variation between the self-identified men and women in our sample. These traits included not only the broad characteristics that are widely used in psychological research (such as extraversion and agreeableness) but also more specific patterns of thought and behavior, such as how frequently an individual takes risks or their degree of focus on aesthetics. We also double-checked our conclusions by running a final study to replicate the major findings. Ultimately we found no large differences in personality between cisgender men and women on any traits. But we did find small and moderate differences in the 18 personality traits.


The most sizable of these differences was the degree to which cisgender people thought about sex, assessed by asking people to rate how much they agreed with the statement “I often have sexual thoughts when I meet an attractive-looking person” and disagreed with the statement “I do not frequently think about sex.” (This “sex-focused” characteristic, while not linked to major personality traits commonly studied in psychology, nonetheless fits the conception of a personality trait as a pattern in thought, emotion or behavior. It also relates to a concept called sexual preoccupation.) We found that gender could explain about 18 percent of the variation in the extent to which people are sex-focused. Men had a higher average score on this trait than women. There were still plenty of women who had a higher score than most men, however. In other words, individual men and women were highly varied, even though at the group level, men tended to differ from women.

On every trait, there was a substantial overlap between men and women. Yet at the tail ends—where people either strongly agreed or disagreed with the questions we asked them—larger differences emerged. For example, very low compassion was rare in both men and women, but the few people who identified as very uncompassionate were much more likely to be men. This result is consistent with the finding that antisocial personality disorder, which often involves a lack of remorse or empathy, is more common among men than women.



So is there a “man's personality” and a “woman's personality”? Fascinatingly, almost everyone in our study was a mix of “more often seen in men” and “more often seen in women” traits. For any given trait, an individual woman was closer to the overall average for women than the overall average for men just 61 percent of the time. And a man was closer to the average for men than the average for women only 57 percent of the time. Only about 1 percent of men and 1 percent of women had almost entirely “more often seen in men” or “more often seen in women” personality traits.


To test how accurately gender can be predicted from personality, we developed a simple machine-learning algorithm (a computer program that looked for patterns in data regarding which personality traits are associated with being a cis man or a cis woman). We trained our algorithm using results from past study participants, then presented the algorithm with the personality traits of new participants to see how well it could predict their gender. Using just the most predictive trait—being sex-focused—the algorithm could predict a person's gender correctly 69 percent of the time. This result may be impressive to some. But the prediction is far from perfect because some women are much more sex-focused than the average man.

The algorithm's accuracy rose to 78 percent when we allowed it to incorporate all the personality differences at once. That's a big improvement—but for the other 22 percent of people, the algorithm was predicting incorrectly. When we released our quiz to the public, accuracy slipped a bit further to 74 percent. That's still much better than the average human, though: We gave another group of study participants sets of personality traits that, we explained, belonged to particular individuals. Then we asked the participants to predict the gender of those other people using the personality traits. They were correct only 58 percent of the time, hardly better than a coin flip. The quiz is called the Gender Continuum Test, and you can try it yourself on our Web site to see whether the algorithm predicts your gender.

We believe our results shed new light on the size of gender differences in personality. There are, however, some important caveats. First, all our study participants were from the U.S., and given that factors such as culture influence personality and gender, we would be hesitant to extend our conclusions to other communities. Second, our study cannot provide insight into the causes of personality differences—for instance, how much these differences can be explained by environment and culture as opposed to biology. Third, as we noted earlier, we do not have enough data to comment on transgender, intersex or nonbinary individuals. We hope that future research explores these and other dimensions of the personality, sex and gender debate.


Right now our study is a reminder that, on average, cisgender men and women do have some small to moderate differences in how they report their personality, but almost everyone is a mix of traits seen more often in men and seen more often in women. If you try to guess someone's personality from their gender, you'll very often be wrong.


Here are your personality results!

Keep in mind that these personality results were measured, for the sake of brevity, using just two questions per personality trait, and so are not a comprehensive assessment of each trait.

- Less Peaceful - more likely to use violence to solve problems
- Less Warm - less expression of happy feelings
- Less Unselfish - less looking out for others before looking out for yourself
- More Sex Focused - more likely to have frequent sexual thoughts
- More Self Defending - less likely to blame yourself for problems


Like FEMALES do on average, you reported yourself as being:


- More Emotionally Aware - having more awareness and understanding of emotional reactions
