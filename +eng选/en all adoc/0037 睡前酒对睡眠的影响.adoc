.anathema
/əˈnæθəmə/ [ Cusually sing.] ( formal ) a thing or an idea which you hate because it is the opposite of what you believe 可憎的事物；可恶的想法 +
-> 希腊前缀ana-这里表up，与on同源，词根the-表to put，后缀-ma表行为对象和结果。anathema本指将掠夺来的敌人的物品置于寺庙（或祭坛）之上来诅咒敌人厄运。历史上最出名的anathema是1054年导致基督教大分裂的东、西罗马帝国教会的相互开除教籍。


.just
( informal ) really; completely 真正地；确实；完全

- The food was *just wonderful*! 那吃的实在是好极了！
- I can *just imagine* his reaction. 我完全可以想象出他的反应。


.dose
( informal ) an amount of sth 一份；一次；一点

- *A dose of flu* kept me off work. 一场感冒使得我上不了班。
- Workers at the nuclear plant were exposed to *high doses of radiation*. 核电站的工作人员受到大量辐射。
- I can cope with her *in small doses* (= for short amounts of time) . 我只能跟她应付片刻。



睡前一杯小酒能帮你更快地进入梦乡。但各类研究表明酒精是对恢复性睡眠的“诅咒”。一份新的综述论文阐述了睡前饮酒的种种不利。

研究人员详细审查了在精心控制的实验环境下进行的20项研究。他们发现了一个明显的趋势：任何剂量的酒精均会改变睡眠。且剂量越多，影响越大。

喝两杯以上的酒会阻碍 REM 睡眠(快速动眼睡眠)，而 REM 睡眠对记忆和健康很重要。并且深度、慢波睡眠阶段也会因一杯以上的饮酒量而缩短。

也许最有效的发现是，在深夜饮用一剂量的酒精会抵消睡眠的功效。这一研究结果发表在《酒精中毒：临床与实验研究》杂志上。

睡眠中断和不足，能够引起从体重增加到心脏病等所有问题。更别提对记忆和健康的不利影响了。

== <pure> 睡前酒对睡眠的影响

A little booze before bedtime might help you fall asleep faster. But various studies show that alcohol is anathema for restorative sleep. A new review paper describes just  how detrimental a few drinks can be.

The researchers pored over 20 studies conducted in controlled lab settings. They found a clear trend that just about any amount of alcohol alters sleep. And the effects are usually bigger with more drinks.

Just two drinks or more cut REM sleep, which is important for memory and health. And those deep, slow-wave sleep periods are also reduced for people who have tied on more than one.

Perhaps the most potent finding is that just a single dose of alcohol in the late evening can zap the efficacy of your z's. The paper is in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.

Disrupted and insufficient sleep has been linked to everything from weight gain to heart problems. Not to mention harming memory and well-being.
