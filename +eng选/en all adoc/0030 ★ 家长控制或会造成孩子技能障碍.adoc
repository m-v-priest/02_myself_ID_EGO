专横的父母们可能会像将孩子们捧在手心里那样照顾免他们受来自同辈的压力。但实际上这种方法可能完全适得其反,孩子们会更易受到别人影响。这是根据在《儿童发展》杂志上的研究所得出的结论。

研究人员对于他们父母，使用诸如内疚操控行为的控制措施进行了研究，而后观察孩子们如何应对一位朋友的不同意见或争论。

*现在受到父母高度控制的年轻人，不能向朋友或合作伙伴自信且及富有成效地强调自己的观点。而且这种缺乏能力的影响，会随着时间增加: 比如18岁时与人的糟糕关系技能，预测在21岁时会进一步恶化。* +
似乎**抵制家长控制，就可使得孩子们坚持己见**，这可是对于健康未来关系不可或缺的一项重要技能。

Seems that resisting parental control may be how kids learn to assert themselves, an important skill for healthy future relationships.
