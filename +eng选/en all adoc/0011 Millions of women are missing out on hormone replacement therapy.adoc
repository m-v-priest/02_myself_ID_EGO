== Millions of women are missing out on hormone replacement therapy

Menopause 绝经期；（妇女的）更年期 harms women’s bones, brains, hearts and immune systems.

*It is associated with* a higher risk of osteoporosis 骨质疏松；骨质疏松症 and *fragility 脆弱性;易碎性 fractures* （指状态）骨折，断裂, increased (v.) abdominal 腹部的 fat 脂肪, and a *heightened (v.)加剧 risk of* contracting 感染,得（病） diabetes 糖尿病, explains Susan Davis, a professor of women’s health at Monash University in Australia.


*The hormonal 荷尔蒙的，激素的 changes of menopause* also seem to make women age (v.)变老 faster.

They speed up *cellular ageing* (n.) by about 6%, when age is measured by the genetic changes in the blood. *It is suspected 怀疑；感觉有问题；不信任 that* the insomnia 失眠（症） (associated (a.)有关联的；相关的 with menopause) could be causing this.

Oestrogen 雌激素 is particularly important in maintaining the health of women’s hearts.

[Before menopause] women have fewer *heart attacks* than men. [After menopause] the risk increases (v.) as the elasticity 弹性；弹力 of *the coronary (a.)冠状动脉的 arteries* 动脉 decreases 减少,降低 along with their oestrogen 雌激素 levels.

更年期会损害女性的骨骼、大脑、心脏和免疫系统。澳大利亚莫纳什大学(Monash University)的女性健康教授苏珊•戴维斯(Susan Davis)解释说，肥胖会增加骨质疏松和脆性骨折的风险，增加腹部脂肪，并增加患糖尿病的风险。

更年期的荷尔蒙变化, 似乎也会让女性衰老得更快。当通过血液中的基因变化, 来测量年龄时，它们会使细胞衰老速度加快约6%。人们怀疑与更年期相关的失眠可能是造成这一现象的原因。雌激素在维持女性心脏健康方面尤为重要。绝经前女性的心脏病发作比男性少。绝经后，随着冠状动脉弹性的降低, 和雌激素水平的降低，患病风险增加。

In 1966 Robert Wilson, a doctor, wrote a book called “Feminine （指气质或外貌）女性特有的，女性的 Forever”.

In it, he argued that 主 women’s loss of hormones after menopause 谓 *give rise to* a serious, painful and often *crippling (a.)严重损害健康的; 致残的 illness*, known as **oestrogen-deficiency (n.)缺乏；缺少；不足 disease**.

主 *A regular (a.)规则的；有规律的；定时的 course* 行动方式,（医疗、服药等的）疗程 of oestrogen supplements 补充（物）；添加物 系 was the solution, he suggested.


By the turn of the millennium 一千年，千年期（尤指公元纪年） *hormone-replacement therapy* 治疗；疗法 was extremely popular.

In America [before 2001] some 20% of *post-menopausal 绝经后的 women* used it *at some point*.

By then *a synthetic 人造的；（人工）合成的 form of* progesterone 孕酮；黄体酮 was being administered  给予，施用（药物等） to make sure that *sth is done fairly* and *in the correct way* 施行；执行 alongside oestrogen; *it had been shown*  证明；表明 to protect women from *an increased risk of* uterine (a.)有关子宫的 cancer caused by giving oestrogen 雌激素 [on its own].

1966年，医生罗伯特·威尔逊写了一本名为《永远女性化》的书。在这本书中，他认为女性在绝经后失去荷尔蒙, 会导致一种严重的、痛苦的、常常是致命的疾病，即雌激素缺乏症。他建议，解决方案是定期服用雌激素补充剂。

在世纪之交，激素替代疗法还是非常流行。在2001年以前，美国有20%的绝经后妇女使用过它。那时, 一种合成形式的黄体酮, 与雌激素一起使用; 它已经被证明可以保护妇女避免因单独注射雌激素而增加的患子宫癌的风险。

The benefits of HRT seemed clear. *Most immediately* 紧接地；直接地, it offered relief (n.) （焦虑、痛苦等的）减轻，缓和 from the miserable  痛苦的；非常难受的；可怜的 symptoms of menopause.

[In the longer term] it reduced the risk of osteoporosis 骨质疏松 (which rises after menopause) and therefore the risk of bone fractures.

Women liked that it seemed to stop their *skin thinning* (probably because it boosts the levels of collagen 胶原蛋白, a protein).

*It was thought* to reduce (v.) the risk of *cognitive 认知的；感知的 decline*.

But most importantly, studies suggested that it prevented *the onset (n.)开端，发生，肇始（尤指不快的事件） of* cardiovascular (a.) 心血管 disease — one of the biggest killers of women.

HRT的好处似乎很明显。最直接的是，它缓解了更年期的痛苦症状。从长期来看，它降低了骨质疏松症(绝经后会增加)的风险，因此也降低了骨折的风险。女性还喜欢它似乎能阻止皮肤变薄(可能是因为它能提高胶原蛋白的水平)。它被认为可以降低认知能力下降的风险。但最重要的是，研究表明，它可以预防心血管疾病 — 女性的最大杀手之一。

But then *a bombshell 出乎意料的事情，意外消息（常指不幸） dropped*.

[In 2002] 主 the results of *a large randomised (a.)随机化的 trial* （对能力、质量、性能等的）试验，试用 conducted by America’s National Institutes of Health, known as the Women’s Health Initiative 倡议；新方案 (WHI), 谓 *were rushed （使）仓促行事，匆忙行事，做事草率 into publication.*

It concluded that `主` taking oestrogen with *synthetic 人造的 progesterone* 孕酮 `谓` increased women’s risk of *breast （女子的）乳房 cancer*, heart attacks, strokes 中风 and *blood clots* 血凝块；血块.

Women were told that the dangers of HRT mostly outweighed 重于；大于； (在重要性或意义上) 超过 any benefits.

But `主` the first conclusions of the WHI 妇女健康倡议 study, on which so much *antipathy (n.)厌恶；反感 to HRT* is still based, 谓 were almost entirely wrong. The study had hoped *to look at strategies 策略 for preventing* heart disease, cancer and osteoporosis 骨质疏松 in post-menopausal women.

但接着一颗重磅炸弹落了下来。2002年，由美国国立卫生研究院进行的一项大型随机试验，即妇女健康倡议(WHI)的结果, 被迅速发表。研究得出的结论是，将雌激素与人造黄体酮一起服用, 会增加女性患乳腺癌、心脏病、中风和血栓的风险。妇女们被告知，荷尔蒙替代疗法的危险远远大于益处。

但是，WHI研究的第一个结论几乎是完全错误的，而对激素替代疗法的许多反感, 仍然是基于此第一个结论而做出。这项研究, 希望着眼于探寻策略, 用来预防绝经后妇女会患心脏病、癌症和骨质疏松症。

It is now clear that 主 the long-term benefits of HRT for women [given 考虑到 it as they enter menopause] 系 are significant.

A careful reanalysis 重新分析 of the studies showed that women in their 50s *were actually 31% less likely to die* in the five to seven years that they were taking hormones.

For women *who have had their uterus 子宫 removed* or who start menopause before the age of 45, it is life-saving, preventing osteoporosis and heart disease for as long as 18 years.

*There is a tiny increase in the rates of* breast cancer among HRT-users after five years of the treatment. This was lower than the risk from working as a flight attendant  服务员；侍者.

."It is now clear that the long-term benefits of HRT for women [given it as they enter menopause] 系 are significant." 这句英语中的 given 是什么意思?


现在很清楚，激素替代疗法, 对进入更年期的妇女的长期益处是显著的。对这些研究进行仔细地重新分析后, 表明，在服用激素的五到七年内，50多岁的女性的死亡率实际上降低了31%。对于那些已经摘除子宫, 或在45岁之前进入更年期的女性来说，这是一种救命的方法，可以预防骨质疏松症和心脏病, 长达18年之久。虽然接受荷尔蒙替代疗法治疗5年后，乳腺癌的发病率略有上升, 但这比做空乘的风险还要低。

主 A study published in the Lancet, a British medical journal, earlier this year 谓 *has reignited（使）重新燃烧；再点燃 controversy (n.)（公开的）争论，辩论，论战 over* the level of risk of *breast cancer* that comes with hormone therapy.

But Ms Davis and others worry that *its conclusions are not reliable*. Moreover any increase in risk *must be weighed 认真考虑；权衡；斟酌 against* that of developing other diseases.

...

*In the absence of* such studies, HRT *remains in medical limbo* （尤指因等待他人作决定）处于不定状态. And so women in their late 40s and early 50s are *losing out* 得不到（需要或觉得应有的东西）. *The window of opportunity* to begin HRT in order to capture (v.) its full benefits — including *resisting 抵制；阻挡; 使不受…的伤害 the effects of* cognitive decline — 系 *may be as little as* two or three years.

.weigh :

.limbo
⇒ 词源不详，可能来自limber, 柔软的，灵活的，用来指西印度群岛的一种舞蹈，舞者需后仰，且越来越低，引申词义处于不定状态。 +
灵薄狱（limbo），意思是“地狱的边缘”，指天堂与地狱之间的区域。电影《盗梦空间》中，limbo被译成了“迷失域”，指的是潜意识的边缘。

.LOSE OUT (ON STH) :
to not get sth you wanted or feel you should have 得不到（需要或觉得应有的东西）


今年早些时候发表在英国医学杂志《柳叶刀》(Lancet)上的一项研究，再次引发了关于激素疗法会导致乳腺癌风险水平的争议。但是戴维斯女士和其他人担心, 其结论不可靠。此外，任何风险的增加, 都必须与发展其他疾病的风险, 进行权衡。

在缺乏此类研究的情况下，HRT仍处于医学上悬而未决的状态。因此，40多岁和50多岁的女性正在失去机会。开始进行激素替代疗法, 以获得其全部好处(包括抵抗认知衰退的影响)的机会, 窗口期可能只有两到三年。
