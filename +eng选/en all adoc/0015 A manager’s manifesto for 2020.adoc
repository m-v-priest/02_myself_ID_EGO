== A manager’s manifesto for 2020


1-. *Give out some praise*. People don’t come to work just for the money. They like to feel *they are making a valuable contribution*. Praise doesn’t have to happen every day and *it cannot be generic* (a.) 一般的；普通的；通用的.

*Pick something specific* that a worker has done which shows extra skill or effort and *single them out*  单独挑出; ideally (ad.)完美的；理想的；最合适的 so that others can hear the compliment 赞扬；称赞. *This is particularly important* for the most junior 地位（或职位、级别）低下的 employees, who will *feel anxious about* their status.

给予一些赞美。人们来工作,不只是为了钱。他们喜欢感觉到自己做了有价值的贡献。你不需要每天都给予赞美，但赞美时,也不能泛泛而谈。挑选出某位员工做过的能表现出他们行使了额外技能或努力的事例，将这位员工挑选出来, 表扬他; 最理想的是让别人听到你的赞美。这对初级的员工尤为重要，因为他们一般会对自己的地位, 感到焦虑。

2-. Remember that *you set the tone*.

If a manager is angry and swears  咒骂；诅咒；说脏话 a lot, *that will be seen as* acceptable behaviour.  +
If bosses *barely 几乎不；几乎没有 communicate*, they are unlikely to receive useful feedback. +
If they *fail to keep their promises*, workers will be less likely to co-operate. +
And if a manager frequently belittles  贬低；小看 a particular employee, that person *is unlikely to get the respect of* their colleagues.

记住，你定下了基调(即, 你的言行是怎样的, 你部门的文化就是怎样的)。如果一个经理易怒，经常骂人，则这将被你的部属视为可以接受的行为(上梁不正下梁歪)。如果老板很少与员工交流，那他们就不太可能得到员工们对其有用的反馈。如果他们不能兑现自己的承诺，则员工们也不太可能与其合作。如果一个经理经常贬低某个员工，则他(即被贬低的员工)就不太可能得到其他同事的尊重。

4-. *Make your priorities* 优先事项；最重要的事；首要事情 (for the next year) *clear*, and communicate them well. Is the company or division （机构的）部门) *trying to launch a new product*? Or *to boost sales of* existing products? Or *to control costs*? If you are not sure, then 主 those who work for you 谓 will have no idea. That can lead to a lot of wasted effort.

5-. *To that end* 为了实现那个目标, cut out 删除；删去;裁剪 the jargon 行话；黑话；行业术语；切口.

The use of *pretentious 炫耀的；虚夸的；自命不凡的 phrases* and complex acronyms 首字母缩略词 is generally designed to obfuscate (v.) （故意地）混淆，使困惑，使模糊不清 rather than 而不是 elucidate (v.) 阐明；解释；说明.

In Bartleby’s experience, 主 the reason people use unclear language 系 is that *they have nothing clear to say*.

If you are sending a general memo to all the staff, look carefully through it and ask *whether you would have understood it* on your first day of work. If not, make it simpler.

Remember George Orwell’s maxim 格言；箴言；座右铭: “Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word *if you can think of* an everyday English equivalent (n.) 相等的东西；等量；对应词.” It *applies to* other tongues  说话方式,语言, too.


.标题
====
.end
目的；目标

.pretentious
trying to appear important, intelligent, etc. in order to impress other people; trying to be sth that you are not, in order to impress 炫耀的；虚夸的；自命不凡的

.acronyms
/ˈækrə-nɪmz/



.obfuscate
⇒ ob-,在上，表强调，-fusc,黑的，词源同dusk.即使变黑的，引申词义混淆，模糊。

.elucidate
-> e-, 向外。-lucid, 照明，词源同light, lucid.

.would have done
“would have understood it”是英语语法中的一种虚拟完成时态。它**用于描述过去的假设情况，但实际上并没有发生。** +
例如，“If I had studied harder, *I would have done better* on the test.”的意思是，如果你学习得更努力，你会在考试中做得更好。

明确明年的工作重点，并做好沟通。公司(或部门)正在尝试推出新产品吗? 或者是要促进现有产品的销售? 还是需要控制成本? 如果你不确定明年你的工作重点，那么你的属下人也不会知道。这会导致大量的努力被白费。

为此，不要使用行话。去使用自命不凡的短语和复杂的缩写词的这种行为, 往往目的是为了故意令人难以理解, 而不是为了阐明清楚。根据巴特比的经验，人们之所以使用含糊不清的语言，是因为他们没有明确的话要说。如果你要给所有的员工发一份备忘录，先仔细看一遍，问问自己在第一天上班时是否就理解它。如果不是，就让这些话语变得更简单。记住乔治•奥威尔(George Orwell)的格言:“如果你能想出一个日常英语中的对等词，就永远不要去使用外国短语、科学词汇或行话。” 它也适用于其他语言。
