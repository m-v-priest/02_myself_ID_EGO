== A manager’s manifesto for 2020


1-. *Give out some praise*. People don’t come to work just for the money. They like to feel *they are making a valuable contribution*. Praise doesn’t have to happen every day and *it cannot be generic* (a.) 一般的；普通的；通用的.

*Pick something specific* that a worker has done which shows extra skill or effort and *single them out*  单独挑出; ideally (ad.)完美的；理想的；最合适的 so that others can hear the compliment 赞扬；称赞. *This is particularly important* for the most junior 地位（或职位、级别）低下的 employees, who will *feel anxious about* their status.


.标题
====
给予一些赞美。人们来工作,不只是为了钱。他们喜欢感觉到自己做了有价值的贡献。你不需要每天都给予赞美，但赞美时,也不能泛泛而谈。挑选出某位员工做过的能表现出他们行使了额外技能或努力的事例，将这位员工挑选出来, 表扬他; 最理想的是让别人听到你的赞美。这对初级的员工尤为重要，因为他们一般会对自己的地位, 感到焦虑。
====


2-. Remember that *you set the tone*.

If a manager is angry and swears  咒骂；诅咒；说脏话 a lot, *that will be seen as* acceptable behaviour.  +
If bosses *barely 几乎不；几乎没有 communicate*, they are unlikely to receive useful feedback. +
If they *fail to keep their promises*, workers will be less likely to co-operate. +
And if a manager frequently belittles  贬低；小看 a particular employee, that person *is unlikely to get the respect of* their colleagues.


.标题
====
记住，你定下了基调(即, 你的言行是怎样的, 你部门的文化就是怎样的)。如果一个经理易怒，经常骂人，则这将被你的部属视为可以接受的行为(上梁不正下梁歪)。如果老板很少与员工交流，那他们就不太可能得到员工们对其有用的反馈。如果他们不能兑现自己的承诺，则员工们也不太可能与其合作。如果一个经理经常贬低某个员工，则他(即被贬低的员工)就不太可能得到其他同事的尊重。
====


4-. *Make your priorities* 优先事项；最重要的事；首要事情 (for the next year) *clear*, and communicate them well. Is the company or division （机构的）部门) *trying to launch a new product*? Or *to boost sales of* existing products? Or *to control costs*? If you are not sure, then 主 those who work for you 谓 will have no idea. That can lead to a lot of wasted effort.

5-. *To that end* 为了实现那个目标, cut out 删除；删去;裁剪 the jargon 行话；黑话；行业术语；切口.

The use of *pretentious 炫耀的；虚夸的；自命不凡的 phrases* and complex acronyms 首字母缩略词 is generally designed to obfuscate (v.) （故意地）混淆，使困惑，使模糊不清 rather than 而不是 elucidate (v.) 阐明；解释；说明.

In Bartleby’s experience, 主 the reason people use unclear language 系 is that *they have nothing clear to say*.

If you are sending a general memo to all the staff, look carefully through it and ask *whether you would have understood it* on your first day of work. If not, make it simpler.

Remember George Orwell’s maxim 格言；箴言；座右铭: “Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word *if you can think of* an everyday English equivalent (n.) 相等的东西；等量；对应词.” It *applies to* other tongues  说话方式,语言, too.


.标题
====
.end
目的；目标

.pretentious
trying to appear important, intelligent, etc. in order to impress other people; trying to be sth that you are not, in order to impress 炫耀的；虚夸的；自命不凡的

.acronyms
/ˈækrə-nɪmz/



.obfuscate
⇒ ob-,在上，表强调，-fusc,黑的，词源同dusk.即使变黑的，引申词义混淆，模糊。

.elucidate
-> e-, 向外。-lucid, 照明，词源同light, lucid.

.would have done
“would have understood it”是英语语法中的一种虚拟完成时态。它**用于描述过去的假设情况，但实际上并没有发生。** +
例如，“If I had studied harder, *I would have done better* on the test.”的意思是，如果你学习得更努力，你会在考试中做得更好。

明确明年的工作重点，并做好沟通。公司(或部门)正在尝试推出新产品吗? 或者是要促进现有产品的销售? 还是需要控制成本? 如果你不确定明年你的工作重点，那么你的属下人也不会知道。这会导致大量的努力被白费。

为此，不要使用行话。去使用自命不凡的短语和复杂的缩写词的这种行为, 往往目的是为了故意令人难以理解, 而不是为了阐明清楚。根据巴特比的经验，人们之所以使用含糊不清的语言，是因为他们没有明确的话要说。如果你要给所有的员工发一份备忘录，先仔细看一遍，问问自己在第一天上班时是否就理解它。如果不是，就让这些话语变得更简单。记住乔治•奥威尔(George Orwell)的格言:“如果你能想出一个日常英语中的对等词，就永远不要去使用外国短语、科学词汇或行话。” 它也适用于其他语言。

这些不足之处中的每一个, 都指向着尚未被发现的物理定律、粒子和力-- 这些谜团, 物理学家们曾期望大型强子对撞机现在已经开始破解了。但事实并非如此。这表明他们关于标准模型之外的东西的假设, 肯定是错误的，而这些假设是这些预期的基础。

最大的期望, 被寄托在了一种被称为"超对称"的优雅思想的身上。这一理论已经存在了超过50年. 该理论, 能用于将众多的"容差系数"从标准模型中删除出去. "容差系数"是业内的叫法. "容差系数"是一个任意的值，它虽然可以使标准模型工作，但这个容差系数为什么是这个值, 你却无法对它做解释。

在标准模型中，可以通过为每个标准模型粒子引入一个更重的“超对称”伙伴(虽然它还没有被试验证实存在), 来消除许多的"容差系数"的这种任意值。例如，电子和夸克的超对称伙伴, 被称为超电子和超夸克。

不幸的是，在LHC经历了近10年的越来越高能量的撞击试验之后，除了希格斯粒子本身之外，没有任何其他的新发现。没有隐藏的维度。没有原因不明的现象出现。没有超对称粒子。因此，对许多物理学家来说，超对称性已经失去了它的光泽。在无数的替代方案中，没有人知道哪一个(如果有的话)最接近事实真相。

不管细节如何，人们的共识是，找到超越标准模型的物理学的途径, 是通过希格斯玻色子本身。这意味着要仔细地研究和描述那个物体的细节。例如，物理学家不知道它究竟是一个没有内部结构的基本粒子(比如电子或夸克)，还是由更小的物体组成的复合物(比如质子和中子分别由三个夸克组成)。甚至有可能，被确认为希格斯的粒子, 实际上并不是标准模型预测的粒子，而是来自另一种尚不知名理论的不同粒子，该粒子恰好具有希格斯的预测质量而已。

希格斯玻色子是不稳定的。它们几乎一产生就会衰变成成对的其他粒子。标准模型预测，在大约60%的时间里，这将产生一个底夸克和它的反物质当量。另外21%的情况下会出现一对W玻色子，9%的希格斯玻色子衰变会产生一对胶子(另外10%会产生更多的组合)。通过制造大量的希格斯玻色子，然后测量底夸克、W玻色子、胶子和其他基本粒子出现的精确速率，FCC的管理者将能观察到与标准模型预测的差异。希格斯玻色子创造的越多，结果所带来统计力量, 就越强大，研究人员就越有信心，他们测量的任何与标准模型预测的偏差实际上都代表了一些真实的东西。

==== <pure> Finding new physics will require a new particle collider


DEEP UNDER the countryside north of Geneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss border, one of the most advanced scientific machines ever built has been banging subatomic particles [together] for more than a decade. This device, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), accelerates beams of protons (members of a class of particle called hadrons) [in opposite directions] around a 27km ring until they reach almost the speed of light. Powerful magnets then force these protons into head-on collisions, causing the energy they carry to be converted — as described by Einstein’s best-known equation, E=mc2 — into matter. And what matter! For 主 sorting through the ejecta from the collisions 谓 gives physicists fleeting glimpses of  the fundamental building blocks of the universe and  the forces that bind or repel them.

The discovery of the Higgs, though, was supposed to be a beginning as well as an end, for the Standard Model now needs to be extended into something bigger. It does not, for example, include gravity. That is the province of General Relativity. Dark matter is also absent. This is a substance, invisible but detectable by its gravitational effects, that makes up 27% of the universe — over five times as much as the so-called normal matter of stars, planets, people and so on.

Each of these inadequacies  points to physical laws, particles and forces (yet to be discovered) — mysteries (which physicists had expected that the LHC would have started cracking open by now). But it has not. That suggests 主 their hypotheses about what lies beyond the Standard Model, which were the basis of those expectations, 谓 must be wrong.


The weightiest expectation was placed [on the shoulders of an elegant idea called supersymmetry]. 主 This theory, developed over the past 50 years, 系 is a way of removing [from the Standard Model] a lot of things known [in the trade] as fudge factors. A fudge factor is an arbitrary value that makes a model work, but which itself defies deeper explanation. In the Standard Model, many such fudges can be erased [by introducing, for each and every Standard Model particle, a heavier “supersymmetric” partner that has not yet been seen]. 主 The putative superpartners of the electron and quark, for example, 谓 are known as the selectron and squark.

The more Higgses created, the more statistical power the results will have, and the more confident researchers will be that any deviations from Standard Model predictions which they measure actually represent something real.

==   What a museum of disgusting food reveals about human nature



When people recognise that disgust *depends [in part] on* upbringing (a.) 抚育；养育；培养, they can learn to overcome it, at least some of the time.

Not only 主 do “immoral” things 谓 disgust people; sometimes, disgust can affect their moral judgments.

In one experiment, Thalia Wheatley of the National *Institutes of Health* 国立卫生研究院 and Jonathan Haidt of the University of Virginia took a group of people *who were susceptible (a.)易受影响（或伤害等）；敏感；过敏) to* hypnosis 催眠状态.

*They were hypnotised (v.)对（某人）施催眠术 to feel* a brief pang (n.)突然的疼痛（或痛苦）；一阵剧痛) of disgust [when they read an everyday 每天的；每日发生的；日常的 word, either “take” or “often”].

Then they read accounts (n.)描述；叙述；报告 of theft, bribery (n.)行贿；受贿 or incest (n.)乱伦；血亲相奸, and were asked how morally outrageous (a.)骇人的；无法容忍的 they thought each incident was.

When *an account 描述；叙述；报告 of* an offence(n.)违法行为；犯罪；罪行 included one of the words that triggered disgust, the participants *condemned (v.) it more severely*.

Other experiments have shown that 主 people who are easily disgusted 谓 *make harsher moral judgments* [when subjected (v.)使经受；使遭受 to *disgusting 极糟的；令人不快的 stimuli* 刺激物, such as *a sticky 黏（性）的 desk* or *foul 肮脏恶臭的；难闻的 smells*].

当人们意识到, "厌恶感"在某种程度上取决于你从小受过什么教育时，他们可以尝试学会克服它，至少在某些时候是这样。

.incest
-> in-,不，非，-cest,纯的，词源同caste,castrate.即不纯洁的，引申词义乱伦。

不但做“不道德”的事, 会令人厌恶;有时，厌恶的感观感觉, 也会影响他们的道德判断。

在一项实验中，美国国立卫生研究院的Thalia Wheatley和弗吉尼亚大学的Jonathan Haidt, 对一组容易受到催眠影响的人, 进行了研究。他们在被催眠后，就让他们阅读每一个日常的普通单词, 比如“take” 或 “often”, 同时, 给他们施加一阵令人会产生厌恶感的短暂刺激. 之后, 就给他们阅读关于盗窃、贿赂或乱伦的报道，并询问他们, 这每一个有罪的行为, 令他们有多无法容忍? 结果证明, 当报道中含有会令人引起厌恶的用词时, 被试者就会更加严厉地谴责它。

其他的实验表明，容易感到厌恶感的人, 在受到令人作呕的刺激时，比如黏糊糊的桌子, 或难闻的气味时，会做出更严厉的道德判断。

Another finding is that 主 people who are more easily disgusted 系 *are more likely(a.) to be* socially conservative (a.)保守的.

A study by Xiaowen Xu of the College of William and Mary 威廉与玛丽学院 in Virginia and others *found evidence that* “disgust-sensitive people [underline]#extend# (v.) their preference (n.) for order 秩序;条理 (in the physical environment (eg, tidying up 使整洁；使整齐 ；使有条理；整理 one’s room)) [underline]#to# *the sociopolitical 社会政治的 environment* (eg, strengthening (v.) *traditional norms*).”

Woo-Young Ahn of Virginia Tech 弗吉尼亚理工大学 and others found that by scanning (v.) *brain responses* to a single disgusting image (such as *a mutilated 使残废；使残缺不全；毁伤) body*, they could *make accurate predictions about* a subject’s  接受试验者；实验对象 *political ideology*  意识形态；观念形态.

主 People *who are highly sensitive to disgust* 系 are especially likely to oppose (v.)反对（计划、政策等）；抵制；阻挠 immigration 外来移民. This is true *even after* controlling for education, income and political ideology.

另一项发现是，更容易会产生恶心感的人, 也更有可能是社会保守主义者。弗吉尼亚的威廉与玛丽学院的 Xiaowen Xu 等人研究发现，有证据表明，“对厌恶感敏感的人, 会将他们对物理环境中的秩序(如整理房间)的偏好, 延伸到社会的政治环境上(如强化传统规范)。” 弗吉尼亚理工大学的 Woo-Young Ahn 等人发现，通过扫描大脑对单独的恶心图像(比如残损的身体)所作出的反应，他们可以准确预测一个被试的政治意识形态。

那些最容易产生(具有敏感性)厌恶感的人, 尤其可能反对移民。即使将他们的教育、收入, 和政治意识形态考虑在内，也是如此。

==== <pure> What a museum of disgusting food reveals about human nature


When people recognise that {disgust depends in part on upbringing}, they can learn to overcome it, at least some of the time.

Not only do “immoral” things disgust people; sometimes, disgust can affect their moral judgments. In one experiment, Thalia Wheatley of the National Institutes of Health and Jonathan Haidt of the University of Virginia took a group of people who were susceptible to hypnosis. They were hypnotised to feel a brief pang of disgust when they read an everyday word, either “take” or “often”. Then they read accounts of theft, bribery or incest, and were asked how morally outrageous they thought each incident was. When an account of an offence included one of the words that triggered disgust, the participants condemned it more severely. Other experiments have shown that 主 people who are easily disgusted 谓 make harsher moral judgments [when subjected to disgusting stimuli, such as a sticky desk or foul smells].


Another finding is that 主 people who are more easily disgusted 系 are more likely  表 to be socially conservative. A study by Xiaowen Xu of the College of William and Mary in Virginia and others found evidence that “disgust-sensitive people extend their preference for order in the physical environment (eg, tidying up one’s room) to the sociopolitical environment (eg, strengthening traditional norms).” Woo-Young Ahn of Virginia Tech and others found that by scanning brain responses to a single disgusting image (such as a mutilated body), they could make accurate predictions about a subject’s political ideology.

People who are highly sensitive to disgust are especially likely to oppose immigration. This is true even after controlling for education, income and political ideology.

== Back pain is a massive problem which is badly treated


Doctors *used to think that* back pain *was almost entirely the result of* mechanical damage to tissue beyond the capacity of X-rays to detect.

The advent of *MRI scans* showed {this was not true}. A definitive (a.)最后的；决定性的；不可更改的 *physical cause* — such as a fracture, a tumour 肿瘤；肿块, *pressure on a nerve*, infection or arthritis 关节炎 — is found in 5-15% of people with back pain.

The rest  剩余部分；残留；其余 *is all labelled (v.)贴标签于；用标签标明 as “non-specific”* 不明确的；非特定的；泛泛的; 不止一种病因的；有多种致病可能的, and there is increasing evidence that it is not mechanical *in origin*.

.标题
====
.mechanical damage :
机械损伤. 是指人体同某种致伤物接触，因机械运动作用, 所造成的机体正常组织的破坏, 或器官的机能性障碍。可分为钝器伤、锐器伤、枪弹伤、火器伤等类。机械性损伤的基本征象有: 表皮剥脱、皮下出血、创伤、骨折、内脏破裂, 肢体断离, 六种。

.non-specific :
a. not definite or clearly defined; general 不明确的；非特定的；泛泛的
→ The candidate’s speech was non-specific. 这位候选人的讲话只是泛泛之谈。

医生们过去认为，背部疼痛几乎完全是组织受到机械损伤的结果，超出了x光检测的能力。核磁共振扫描的出现, 表明事实并非如此。5-15%的背痛患者, 都有明确的生理原因，如骨折、肿瘤、神经压迫、感染或关节炎。其余的都被贴上了“非单一原因导致的”的标签，而且越来越多的证据表明, 机械损伤并非是它的病因。

Some sufferers  *catastrophise (v.)小题大做，把事情复杂化 the news into the idea that* they have a broken, fragile back and  start avoiding normal physical activity — *not least* 特别；尤其, says Ms Knight of St Thomas’, because doctors *often fail to explain to them ① that* {abnormalities (n.)身体、行为等不正常，反常  are, in fact, quite normal}, and ② *that* {degeneration 蜕化；衰退**can basically 总的说来；从根本上说 be** wear and tear 损耗}.

exercise daily;  *[underline]#accept# flare-ups(n.)疾病突发；（尤指）复发 [underline]#as# temporary setbacks*(n.)挫折；阻碍;  *don’t get fixated (a.) on* （对…）异常依恋，固恋 the pain.

The programme, explains Ms Knight, aims [underline]#not# *to reduce pain* [underline]#so much as# *to add to life*.


*In a typical class* of ten people, Ms Knight says, one or two *decide that* the approach *is not what they want*, and may *drop out* 不再参加；退出；脱离. Most of them *take away at least some skills* which add to their *quality of life*. One or two, like Mr Moore, find the programme life-changing(a.)改变人生的.


.标题
====
.wear and tear
损耗,磨损

.not A so much as B / not so much A as B :
与其说A, 倒不如说B / 是B,而不是A. 即, 轻前, 重后 +
A和B是两个被比较的平行结构，如同为介词短语、动词不定式、名词短语或其他平行结构。

- Science moves forward, they say, *not so much* through the insights of great men of genius *as* because of more ordinary things like improved techniques and tools.
他们说，科学的发展**与其说**源于天才伟人的真知灼见，**不如说**源于改进了的技术和工具等更为普通的东西。

- The great use of a school education is *not so much* to teach you things *as* to teach you the art of learning.
学校教育的伟大作用不在于教会你多少东西，而在于教会你学习的技巧。

一些患者将他们从扫描中看到的信息, 小题大做, 以为他们有了一个骨折的, 脆弱的背部，并开始避免正常的身体活动，尤其是, 因为医生经常未能向他们解释，这种异常, 实际上是很正常的，身体机能的退化, 基本上源于年龄所导致的身体器官的磨损。而你如果不活动的话, 带来的肌肉僵硬和身体虚弱, 反而往往会令情况变得更糟。

每天锻炼；将突发的疾病, 视为是暂时的挫折；不要专注于疼痛。奈特女士解释说，这个项目的目的, 与其说是减轻病痛，不如说是为了增加生命的质量。

在一个典型的有十人的班级里，会有一两个病友认为这种方式不是他们想要的，而可能退出。但班里的大多数人, 至少会学到一些机能, 能给他们的生活质量带来提高。班里会有一两个人, 就像摩尔先生一样，会发现这个项目能改变他们的人生。
