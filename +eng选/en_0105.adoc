如果sat考试, 大大降低了那些来自贫困阶层的学生的入学成功率, 则sat即使能够带来更好的大学成绩预测能力, 这一点点的好处, 也不足以证明sat考试就应该存在下去. 大学机构如何权衡这种取舍, 取决于他们自身的使命, 他们所站立的背景, 以及他们想要吸引哪类人进大学.

这其实涉及到了一个古老的问题 — 大学, 应该视自己为最优秀的学术者的中心, 因此只接收那些学术能力最出色的学生. 还是说, 他们应该抱持着更广泛的造福社会的使命, 从而牺牲一些学术能力优秀的学生, 而去追求另一种概念的平等?

If they significantly decreased the number of successful applicants from already disadvantaged groups, such a sacrifice would presumably not be justified by a minor gain in predictive power. How institutions judge this trade-off depends on their mission, circumstances and the cohort they want to attract. This goes to the heart of an age-old question. Should universities consider themselves primarily as centres of academic excellence, and therefore strive to accept the students most likely to excel academically? Or should they accept a broader mission to improve society, which could mean sacrificing some academic excellence in the pursuit of a different definition of equality?

尽管如此，仍有零星的证据表明，美国人对移民们日益增长的反感, 给一些工人带来了好处. 哈佛大学(Harvard University)的戈登•汉森(Gordon Hanson)认为，低技能移民的数量减少, 其影响, 在三个特定的职业中表现最突出: 即, 管家、建筑与地面维护工人, 和干墙安装工. 因为这些工作严重依赖外来的移民劳工，他们所提供的服务, 是无法通过国际贸易来进口的。根据《经济学人》的计算，这些职业的平均工资增长速度, 要比其他低薪工作快得多。
