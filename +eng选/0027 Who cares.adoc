== Who cares?


In the future, many experts argue, **the vast majority of** old people should be looked after at home /for as long as possible. In *all but* 几乎；差不多;除…外全部 *the most severe cases* /this is cheaper. It is also what most old people want. 主 Putting them in big institutions 系 *is the opposite 对立面；反面 of* what they say *they value most*: autonomy 自治；自主 and independence. And [for those who still need it], *residential care* 福利社为需求比住宿更多的照应的人(如儿童或智力残疾人士)提供的带有社工监管的家庭式住宅 should be transformed.

.residential care :
N the provision (by a welfare agency) (of a home (with social-work supervision)) for people (who need(v.) more than just housing accommodation), such as children in care or mentally handicapped adults 福利社为某些人提供的家庭式住宅, 该住宅带有社工监管. 那么是为哪些人提供的呢? 如儿童或智力残疾人士.

许多专家认为，未来，绝大多数的老年人, 应该尽可能地在自己家里得到照顾。除了最严重的情况外，这是更便宜的护理方法。这也是大多数的老年人想要的。把他们放入大型机构里来照料养老, 与他们所说的他们最看重的东西 — 自治和独立 — 相反。而对于那些仍然需要这类大型机构的老年人来说，住宿护理的方式应该得到转变。

Most people will need care [as they age]. [In some countries] that will bankrupt them. 主 Some 70% of Americans who reach the age of 65 谓 will eventually need help(v.) doing at least two basic daily activities, such as washing or dressing 穿衣服; 48% will receive *paid care*; 16% will get dementia(n.)痴呆；精神错乱.

⇒ de-去掉 + -ment-记忆,智力 + -ia名词词尾

随着年龄的增长，大多数人都需要护理的帮助。在一些国家，这将使他们破产。美国65岁以上的人中, 大约有70%的人最终会需要有人帮助他们, 来做至少两项基本的日常活动，如洗衣或穿衣；美国65岁以上的人中, 48%的人将接受有偿护理；16%的人将患上老年痴呆症。女性的风险更高。

[All around the world] staff(n.) at care homes *turn over 移交(职位、责任) quickly*. In Germany nearly a third of long-term-care workers leave their jobs after only one year. In France a fifth of *home-care positions* were vacant in 2018. *That is not surprising （表示原因）考虑到 given that* carers are paid *on average* 35% less than people who do similar jobs in hospitals, according to the OECD 经合组织, a club of mostly rich countries. 主 Receiving care [from *a rotating 旋转的 cast （一出戏剧或一部电影的）全体演员 of* strangers] 系 is bad for everyone, but *it is a particular problem* for people (with dementia 痴呆). They *make up the majority of* care-home residents but 主 mostly 谓 do not live in institutions (that specialise in their condition). [*At the height of the outbreak* in London] more than one-quarter of staff in care homes for the elderly could not work, or would not. Officials *sent in* 派某人去（应付困难局面） temporary workers to replace them. That probably spread(v.) the virus even further.

在世界各地，疗养院的工作人员很快就会换岗。在德国，近三分之一的长期护理人员仅在一年后就离职了。在法国，2018年有五分之一的家庭护理职位空缺。根据经济合作与发展组织(OECD，一个主要由富裕国家组成的俱乐部)的数据，这并不令人惊讶，因为养老院中护工的报酬, 比在医院做类似工作的人平均要少35%。对每个人来说, 接受陌生人的轮流照顾, 这种情形是糟糕的，但这对老年痴呆患者来说, 这还是一个特别严重的问题。而他们构成了疗养院中居住者的大多数，这些人中的大多数也并不住在专门治疗他们这种疾病的机构里。在伦敦疫情最严重的时候，养老院工作人员中有超过四分之一的人, 不能工作，或者不愿意工作。官员们只能派来临时工来接替他们。但这很可能会同时将病毒也传播得更远。

As well as *exposing(v.) fragile business models*, the pandemic *has highlighted(v.) the tension* between keeping old people safe and keeping them happy and well, says Adam Gordon of the University of Nottingham.

- The mother is usually the custodial(a.) parent after a divorce. 离婚后通常是母亲拥有孩子的监护权。

诺丁汉大学(University Of Nottingham)的亚当·戈登(Adam Gordon)表示，这除了暴露出商业模式的脆弱外，疫情还突显了"保障老年人的安全"与"让他们生活得快乐安康"之间的冲突关系。监管机构鼓励疗养院要不断严格关注老年人的跌倒、褥疮和体重下降等负面指标。但是，生活质量不仅仅是摔倒问题。老龄问题专家安妮·汤姆林森(Anne Tumlinson)希望看到养老院变得不那么“监护”，而应更热诚关注于“令老人们活得幸福”。

对于一些人，特别是非常孤独和患有痴呆症的老人来说，家访是不够的。日托中心可以帮助他们。瑞士的一些人会把老人们从家里接走，帮他们穿衣，然后在一天结束时把他们送回家。在瑞典，老年人的日托服务由国家提供，与托儿服务的方式大致相同。智利只有一个很小的正规护理部门，但其政府已决定将老年人的日托作为优先事项。

- The drug brought a brief respite(n.) from the pain. 药物暂时缓解了疼痛。

日托服务可以改善老年人的身心健康。他们还为老人的家人提供建议和喘息之机。在富裕国家，超过八分之一的50岁以上的人(以下称乙方), 每周至少为另外一个人(以下称甲方)提供一次护理。帮助人们在家中养老的关键是, 防止他们(乙方)在照顾其他老人时累垮。对这些照顾者(乙方)的更多支持, 也有助于降低他们(乙方)自己健康状况下降的风险，也能降低他们退出劳动力大军的可能性。在美国，为老年人提供帮助的人(乙方)中, 有48%在照顾痴呆症患者(其中四分之一的人(乙方), 至少还有一个18岁以下的孩子要照顾)。在那些以前有工作的人中，18%的人(乙方)在被要求帮助时, 从全职工作转为兼职工作。约16%的人请假，9%的人干脆辞职。

ChatGPT: 这句话的意思是，在美国，48%照顾老年人的人照顾的对象是患有痴呆症的人（其中四分之一的人还要照顾至少一个18岁以下的孩子）。在那些此前有工作的人中，18%的人从全职工作调整为兼职工作以便提供帮助；16%的人请了休假；9%的人干脆辞掉了工作。这说明照顾老年人的负担很重，可能会对照顾者自身的健康和职业造成负面影响，因此需要更多的支持和帮助。

一些老人将不得不搬出不合适他们养老的家。但即使到那时，大多数人也不需要搬到养老机构里去。丹麦在提供替代方案方面, 处于领先地位。丹麦政府花在非住宅类护理上的钱, 比花在住宅类上的更多。老年丹麦人的选择包括, 搬到靠近养老院的老年社区, 或公寓里去住. 其他地方的政府, 帮助家庭能更方便地建造家庭附加房间, 来为年老的亲戚提供住处. 荷兰则鼓励学生和其他一些年轻人, 共享出自己创庭院或房间, 来给不是他们家人的老年人住, 以换取年轻人能得到便宜的租金。这样做的目的是，年轻人能为老年人提供陪伴和偶尔需要帮助时的帮忙。

改善医疗护理的成本不会低。但是，将就于糟糕的护理, 只会把负担推到未来. 美国的研究表明，在医疗报销上削减10%的费用, 就与老年人在走路、洗澡等活动能力上下降近10%, 以及持续性的疼痛增加5%, 有因果关联。英国由于医院外缺乏良好的护理机构, 造成那些不需要住院治疗的老年人, 依然赖在病床上, 给医院每月都会损失83000天的住院时间.
