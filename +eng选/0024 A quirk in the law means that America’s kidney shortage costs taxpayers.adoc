== A quirk in the law means that America’s kidney shortage costs taxpayers

主 Mr Glazer’s goal — to ensure that 主 all patients reliant (a.)依赖性的；依靠的 on *blood-filtering dialysis* machines, because of failing kidneys, 谓 would be covered by *a then-newfangled (a.)新奇怪异的；时髦复杂的 programme* called Medicare （美国） 国家老年人医疗保险制度, 主 the government *health-insurance scheme* for the elderly, regardless of age — 谓 soon became law.


Dialysis (n.)渗析；透析（尤指将废物从肾病病人的血液中分离出来） is expensive: a machine must *filter out toxins* 毒素 and *excess fluids from the blood*, often for several hours a day and several times per week. *It is a life-or-death (a.)生死攸关的 treatment*. Still, two-thirds of patients with ESRD  终末期肾病 die within five years. A year of treatment (in a specialised 专业化的; 专门的 centre) costs $91,000.

.newfangled
/ˌnuːˈfæŋɡld/ (a.)used to describe sth that has recently been invented or introduced, but that you do not like because it is not what you are used to, or is too complicated 新奇怪异的；时髦复杂的 ( disapproving)
⇒ new,新的，fang,牙齿，咬。引申词义咬住最新的，与时俱进的，新奇时髦的。

.ESRD  :
终末期肾病 end-stage renal disease


格雷泽的目标是, 确保所有因肾脏衰竭而依赖血液过滤透析机的患者, 都能得到医疗保险的覆盖. 这在当时还是一项新奇的计划，即针对老年人的政府健康保险计划，无论他们的年龄 —— 格雷泽的这个目标, 很快就成为了法律。

但透析是昂贵的:机器必须过滤掉血液中的毒素和多余的液体，通常是每天几个小时，每周几次。这是一种生死攸关的治疗方法。然而，三分之二的ESRD患者, 还是会在五年内死亡。在专业中心, 一年的治疗费用为91000美元。

[For many patients] *a kidney transplant* is a much better option than several years of dialysis (n.)(肾的)透析 before death — *life expectancy* is much longer, and that life is of higher quality.

It also saves money for the taxpayer, notes Mario Macis of Johns Hopkins University. “*The math is such that* every kidney transplant *generates (v.)  savings (n.)节省 [for Medicare] of* about $150,000,” says Mr Macis.

不断上升的糖尿病和高血压, 是慢性肾病的前兆。

对许多患者来说，肾脏移植, 是比死前几年透析更好的选择 ——预期寿命会更长，生活质量更高。约翰霍普金斯大学的Mario Macis指出，这也为纳税人省了钱。Macis先生说:“从数学上讲，每一例肾脏移植, 都能为医疗保险节省大约15万美元。”
