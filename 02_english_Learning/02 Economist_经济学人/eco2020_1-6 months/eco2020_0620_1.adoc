Actually, China *used(v.) its armed forces [more]* in 1990s, when they were weak, the paper *notes*. Today China *prefers to use* its coastguard 海岸警卫队（在美国隶属于军队）, its *maritime  海的；海事的；海运的；船舶的 militia* 民兵组织；国民卫队 and other agencies *to bully* neighbours. *China was rather aggressive*(a.)好斗的；挑衅的；侵略的；富于攻击性的;气势汹汹的；声势浩大的；志在必得的 under Hu Jintao, the country’s *distinctly 明显地；无疑地，确实地 cautious leader* in 2002-12. *Drawing on* 凭借；利用；动用 Chinese archives 档案; 档案馆 and interviews with officials, Ms Zhang *offers* a “cost-balancing theory” of decision-making 决策: that *China uses(v.) coercion*(n.)强迫；胁迫 “when the need *to establish a reputation* [for *resolve is high* /and *the economic cost is low*]”. Thus *China was quiet* 轻声的；轻柔的；安静的;克制的；稳重的；不张扬的 in the South China Sea in the early 2000s, when *it wanted a free-trade deal* with the Association 协会；社团；联盟 of South-East Asian Nations. Later *it became assertive*(a.)坚定自信的；坚决主张的 [after *deciding that* this group 指东南亚国家联盟 *needed* Chinese trade *more than* the other way round] -- and *had to be deterred 制止；阻止；威慑；使不敢 from* seeking(v.) international help in the South China Sea. China especially likes(v.) *to inflict(v.)使遭受打击；使吃苦头 asymmetric 不对称的，不对等的 economic pain*, as when *it banned(v.) imports of bananas from the Philippines* during *a territorial 领土的 dispute* in 2012, *devastating 彻底破坏；摧毁；毁灭 Filipino farmers* 农场主；农人 but *barely hurting its own consumers*.

- 张欣参考了中国的档案资料和对官员的采访，提出了一种决策的“成本平衡理论”：“当树立决心声誉的必要性很高，而经济成本较低时”，中国就会使用强制手段。因此，在21世纪初，当中国希望与东南亚国家联盟(ASEAN)达成自由贸易协议时，中国在南中国海保持沉默。后来，在让定这个集团比其他地区更需要中国的贸易后，它就变得自信起来 -- 必须阻止他们在南中国海问题上寻求国际帮助。中国尤其喜欢造成不对称的经济痛苦，比如2012年领土争端期间，中国禁止从菲律宾进口香蕉，给菲律宾农民带来了毁灭性的打击，但对本国消费者几乎没有伤害。

- 总而言之，相比于与过去一段时间以来，中国感觉对其他国家的依赖程度有所降低。同样的, 中国也变得异常自信。遵循这一逻辑，只与中国保持有限的经济联系, 可能不会让其他国家变得更安全。印度是最新一个面临这种困境的国家, 它也不会是最后一个。

== Why China bullies

It sees a world distracted by covid-19, and too economically weak to hold it back

Jun 18th 2020 |


CHINA IS OFTEN called a country in thrall to nationalism. The reality is more complex than that, and more cynical. For proof, look at the remarkable calm (so far, at least) that has reigned since June 15th, when Chinese and Indian troops fought their deadliest border skirmish in almost half a century. On a sweltering afternoon in Beijing, nearly three days after that Himalayan clash, a couple of bored-looking police were the only sign of extra security around India’s embassy.

China’s state-run media had by then issued terse reports of a violent border incident. Lots of internet users reposted news items about dead Indian soldiers. There was only limited grumbling about the failure of official Chinese sources to reveal details of casualties suffered by the Chinese army. Indeed, some netizens treated the story as a joke, mocking India’s soldiers as feeble.

Compare that muted response with the rage provoked last October by the manager of an American basketball team, Daryl Morey of the Houston Rockets, when he retweeted the slogan: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong”, in support of anti-government protests in that territory. Millions of Chinese demanded Mr Morey’s sacking. Within two days Chinese broadcasters announced that they would not show Rockets games.

Chinese nationalism is often compared to a tiger which Communist Party bosses have fed for years—and which they are now condemned to ride, for fear of being eaten if they dismount. In reality, popular nationalism resembles a deep, man-made reservoir, created by the damming-up and channelling of long-existing forces. Most of the time, Chinese leaders can restrain or unleash public rage at will. Only in the biggest crises do they feel constrained to open the floodgates to ease dangerous pressure.

Public grievances are especially strong when America, Japan or other much-condemned countries are involved. Chaguan was a reporter in Beijing in May 1999 when NATO warplanes bombed China’s embassy in Belgrade, killing three journalists. Chinese leaders dismissed American promises that this was an accident, and for four days let students hurl rocks at the American and British embassies. Violence was controlled like water from a tap. Smashing windows and diplomats’ parked cars was allowed. But when youngsters tried to burn the American embassy’s flag with a flaming rag on a long bamboo pole, Chaguan watched paramilitary police beat them back. “Traitors!” howled the crowd.

Often dismissed by Chinese as poor and chaotic, India is not in the rogue’s gallery of imperialist bullies that China’s young learn about at school. Vitally, two-way trade with India is rather modest: 11 countries are larger trade partners for China. All those factors leave Chinese rulers free to downplay a crisis with India. For even when China appears reckless, it is calculating rewards and risks.

Opportunistic yes, reckless no

A revealing paper published last year by Ketian Zhang of George Mason University, in Virginia, charts how China has been throwing its weight around in its region. Titled “Cautious Bully: Reputation, Resolve and Beijing’s Use of Coercion in the South China Sea”, it tests claims that China’s willingness to use force is explained by its growing military strength or the assertiveness of its leaders. Actually, China used its armed forces more in 1990s, when they were weak, the paper notes. Today China prefers to use its coastguard, its maritime militia and other agencies to bully neighbours. China was rather aggressive under Hu Jintao, the country’s distinctly cautious leader in 2002-12. Drawing on Chinese archives and interviews with officials, Ms Zhang offers a “cost-balancing theory” of decision-making: that China uses coercion “when the need to establish a reputation for resolve is high and the economic cost is low”. Thus China was quiet in the South China Sea in the early 2000s, when it wanted a free-trade deal with the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Later it became assertive after deciding that this group needed Chinese trade more than the other way round—and had to be deterred from seeking international help in the South China Sea. China especially likes to inflict asymmetric economic pain, as when it banned imports of bananas from the Philippines during a territorial dispute in 2012, devastating Filipino farmers but barely hurting its own consumers.

That pattern continues. Recent Chinese boycotts have targeted things like Australian beef or Houston Rockets games, but not more vital commodities. All this casts another light on China’s assertiveness during this pandemic year, and the notion that China is taking advantage of a world distracted by covid-19 to throw its weight around. It is true that China has been aggressive in recent months. Beyond its readiness to skirmish on the Indian border, it has decided to impose a draconian national-security law on Hong Kong, slapped trade boycotts on Australia and other Western nations, and sent coastguard ships to sink or harass foreign vessels in the contested waters of the South China Sea. It is also true that the world is geopolitically distracted. It is hard for governments to chide China over democracy in Hong Kong, say, while also negotiating to buy Chinese ventilators. But economics matters, too.

This is a time of slumping global demand for China’s goods and interrupted supply chains. Chinese officials are betting on domestic demand to drive their country’s recovery from covid-19. To control the virus, the mainland’s borders are closed to almost all foreigners. Chinese parents are thinking twice about sending students to universities in America, Australia and Europe. Chinese officials growl that Hong Kong-based foreign banks must support the national-security law, for they are eminently replaceable.

All in all, China feels less reliant on other countries than it has for a while. That same China is also being unusually assertive. Follow the logic through, and having limited economic ties with China may not make other countries safer. India is the latest country to be confronted with that dilemma. It will not be the last.

The state-budget train *crash*

Why this *could cost lives* 造成生命损失 and *set back* 使推迟；耽误；使延误 economic recovery

Jun 18th 2020 |



THE START of *the fiscal year* -- July 1st in most states -- *is* usually about 将近；几乎 *as exciting 令人激动的；使人兴奋的 as* a 501(a) tax filing (提起（诉讼）；提出（申请）；送交（备案）) 纳税申报  and *as unpredictable 无法预言的；不可预测的；难以预料的 as* a Saudi 沙特阿拉伯的 weather forecast 天气预报 (sunny again!). Not this time 这一次不会,这次不会. State tax revenues 税收收入 *collapsed* in April, *falling [on average] by half*, according to the Urban Institute, a think-tank. *Demands on spending(n.) soared*(v.) because the states *are responsible for* much of America’s spending(n.) on public health, unemployment and policing. By some calculations, state-budget deficits 赤字；逆差；亏损 *will reach a quarter 四分之一 of revenues* in the coming fiscal year -- or *would do*, if most states *had not bound themselves* by law *to run* balanced budgets. So *instead of* vast deficits 亏损; 赤字, the states *will have to make savage 凶恶的；凶残的；损害严重的 cuts to public services* in the midst of a recession 经济衰退；经济萎缩 and pandemic. Through *no fault 责任；过错；过失 of their own*, their budgets *are out of control* and *are about to hit the buffers* 缓冲物；起缓冲作用的人.

-  因此，在经济衰退和疫情大流行期间, 各州将不得不大幅度削减公共服务，而不是采取巨额赤字政策。虽然不是他们的过错，但他们的预算已经失控，并即将撞向缓冲区。

Two-thirds of state revenues *come from income taxes or sales taxes*. Sales taxes *have been devastated* 彻底破坏；摧毁；毁灭 [by *the closure of shops and restaurants*] and income taxes [by *the rise in unemployment*]. The jobless rate *was* 13.3% in May, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, *up from 3.5%* in February. `主` Each percentage-point rise(n.) (in the unemployment rate) `谓` *cuts(v.) state tax revenues* by over $40bn, or 4.5%.

- 失业率每上升一个百分点，州的税收金额就会减少400亿美元，即4.5%。


Revenues *have fallen [so] fast* [that] some states *do not even know* by how much. Of those (that *have reported*) estimates, Louisiana *saw* tax revenues *drop by 43%* in April *compared with* April 2019 (“surreal” 离奇的；怪诞的；梦幻般的；超现实的, the state treasurer （俱乐部或组织的）司库，会计，出纳，财务主管 *called* that). New York’s *were down* by two-thirds and California’s income-tax receipts （企业、银行、政府等）收到的款项，收入 *plunged* 暴跌；骤降；突降;使突然前冲（或下落） 85%. Revenues in April *were doubly depressed*(a.)不景气的；萧条的；经济困难的 because the federal government, with states *following suit* 跟着某人做；仿效某人；照着做;跟牌（跟着别人出同花色的牌）, *moved* tax-filing 纳税申报 day *from April to July*, *causing* uncertainty about when income tax *will be paid*. Revenues *may recover* somewhat. But Ronald Alt of the Federation of Tax Administrators, which *advises* 劝告；忠告；建议; 出主意；提出建议；提供咨询 state governments, *reckons that*, collectively, state tax revenues *will fall by $150bn* between the start of April and the end of June. He *expects* 预料；预期；预计 income taxes *to fall by half* and sales taxes *to fall* by 44%. This decline *is larger* [in nominal 名义上的 terms] *than* during the Great Recession, when state tax revenues *fell by $100bn* [from] peak [to] trough 低谷；（企业或经济的）低潮，萧条阶段;（海浪间的）波谷；（小山间的）槽谷，盆状洼地 in three years.

- surreal : adj.   /səˈriːəl/ ( also less frequent sur·real·is·tic ) very strange; more like a dream than reality, with ideas and images mixed together in a strange way 离奇的；怪诞的；梦幻般的；超现实的 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/s/surreal.jpg[100,100]

- 收入下降如此之快，以至于一些州甚至不知道下降了多少。在已经公布的估计数据中，与2019年4月相比，路易斯安那州4月的税收收入下降了43%(州财政部长称之为“超现实”)。纽约的收入下降了三分之二，加州的所得税收入下降了85%。由于联邦政府和各州纷纷效仿，将报税日从4月移至7月，这给何时缴纳所得税带来了不确定性. 4月份的收入加倍低迷. 收入可能会有所回升。但是，为各州政府提供咨询的税务管理联合会的罗纳德•奥特(Ronald Alt)估计，从4月初到6月底，各州的税收收入总共将减少1500亿美元。他预计, 所得税将下降一半，销售税将下降44%。按名义价值计算，这一降幅超过了“大衰退”(Great Recession)时期。当时，国家税收收入在3年内从峰值降至低谷，降幅达1000亿美元。

- 州和地方政府的支出， 略低于联邦政府的支出，约占GDP的17%，而联邦政府的支出占了GDP的20%。但是，由于失业保险、公共卫生和医疗补助(向穷人提供的医疗保险)主要是由各州组织的，因此它们在应对冠状病毒方面有着不成比例地重要性。康涅狄格州通常每周会有3000 - 3500人来申请失业救济。但今年4月，该州一周就收到了3万份申请。在新泽西州，四月份中的医疗补助的注册率， 是一年前的九倍。

- 城市研究所(Urban Institute)的露西•达达扬(Lucy Dadayan)估计，2020财年和2021财年的预算缺口将分别为750亿美元和1250亿美元。另一个智库——预算与政策优先中心(CBPP)估计，这一数字将更高:本财年为1200亿美元，2021财年为3150亿美元，2022财年为1800亿美元，总计6150亿美元，是6个月的当期支出。(这些预测显示了大流行之前的预期,与现在的预期,之间的差别。)

- 估计出的值，其浮动区间很大, 这反映出, 要想预测疫情的影响和到底会削减多少开支, 难度很大. 然而，与下面的事实相比，确切的数额其实并不重要: 第一，这些数字很大; 第二，大多数州无论如何都不能执行赤字政策. 因此，这些数字表达的只是未来削减开支的程度，而不是对赤字进行融资的需求量程度。

- 这些财政开支上的削减, 会通过各州的财政储备和联邦援助, 来缓解其不利影响。各州必须平衡预算的规定, 使它们在财政上变得保守。大多数州在2010年代建立了财政储备。根据无党派的智库皮尤慈善信托基金的数据，到2019年时, 这一数字达到了750亿美元，是有史以来最高的，相当于支出的8%(或28天的值)。但这只是CBPP(预算和政策优先中心智库)对2020-22年缺口预测的八分之一。对大疫情的支出已经消耗尽了谨慎时期建立的福利金。

- 5月中旬，众议院承诺提供5000亿美元。但该法案在参议院搁浅，参议院多数党领袖米奇·麦康奈尔表示，应该允许各州宣布破产(这可能不符合宪法)。这使得各州在很大程度上只能靠自己来努力平衡预算。

The state-budget train crash

Why this could cost lives and set back economic recovery

Jun 18th 2020 |


THE START of the fiscal year—July 1st in most states—is usually about as exciting as a 501(a) tax filing and as unpredictable as a Saudi weather forecast (sunny again!). Not this time. State tax revenues collapsed in April, falling on average by half, according to the Urban Institute, a think-tank. Demands on spending soared because the states are responsible for much of America’s spending on public health, unemployment and policing. By some calculations, state-budget deficits will reach a quarter of revenues in the coming fiscal year—or would do, if most states had not bound themselves by law to run balanced budgets. So instead of vast deficits, the states will have to make savage cuts to public services in the midst of a recession and pandemic. Through no fault of their own, their budgets are out of control and are about to hit the buffers.

Two-thirds of state revenues come from income taxes or sales taxes. Sales taxes have been devastated by the closure of shops and restaurants and income taxes by the rise in unemployment. The jobless rate was 13.3% in May, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, up from 3.5% in February. Each percentage-point rise in the unemployment rate cuts state tax revenues by over $40bn, or 4.5%.

Revenues have fallen so fast that some states do not even know by how much. Of those that have reported estimates, Louisiana saw tax revenues drop by 43% in April compared with April 2019 (“surreal”, the state treasurer called that). New York’s were down by two-thirds and California’s income-tax receipts plunged 85%. Revenues in April were doubly depressed because the federal government, with states following suit, moved tax-filing day from April to July, causing uncertainty about when income tax will be paid. Revenues may recover somewhat. But Ronald Alt of the Federation of Tax Administrators, which advises state governments, reckons that, collectively, state tax revenues will fall by $150bn between the start of April and the end of June. He expects income taxes to fall by half and sales taxes to fall by 44%. This decline is larger in nominal terms than during the Great Recession, when state tax revenues fell by $100bn from peak to trough in three years.

State and local governments spend slightly less than the federal government, about 17% of GDP, compared with a federal share of 20%. But they are disproportionately important to the coronavirus response because unemployment insurance, public health and Medicaid (which provides health insurance for the poor) are largely organised by states. Connecticut usually gets 3,000-3,500 new unemployment claims a week. In April it got 30,000 in a week. In New Jersey, enrolment in Medicaid was nine times higher in April than it had been a year earlier.

For the past nine years, states have cautiously increased spending. At the start of 2020, before the pandemic hit, states were expecting increases in both revenues and spending of about 2%. Instead, the virus has driven a wedge between the two.

Lucy Dadayan of the Urban Institute estimates that the gap will be around $75bn in fiscal 2020 and $125bn in fiscal 2021. The Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), another think-tank, reckons it will be even higher: $120bn in the current fiscal year, $315bn in fiscal 2021 and $180bn in 2022, a grand total of $615bn, which is six months of current spending. (These forecasts show the difference between what was expected before the pandemic and what is expected now.)

The range in estimates reflects the difficulty of forecasting the impact of the pandemic and expectations of spending cuts. The exact amounts, however, matter less than the fact that, first, the figures are large and, second, that most states cannot run deficits anyway, so the numbers indicate the extent of future spending cuts, rather than deficit-financing needs.

These cuts will be mitigated by states’ financial reserves and by federal help. The rule that states must balance budgets has made them fiscally conservative. Most used the 2010s to build up reserves. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonpartisan think-tank, these reached $75bn in 2019, the highest ever, equal to 8% of spending (or 28 days’ worth). But that is just an eighth of CBPP’s forecast of the shortfall in 2020-22. The costs of the pandemic have swept away the benefits of caution.



The federal government has also offered help, but not enough. It is financing new unemployment insurance introduced during the pandemic and in March gave states an extra $110bn. But the money may not be used to compensate for revenue shortfalls. And anyway, the (bipartisan) National Governors Association reckons states need $500bn. Glenn Hubbard, the former head of George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, calls the extra help “about as close to a no-brainer...as possible”. In mid-May the House of Representatives promised $500bn. But the bill stalled in the Senate, where the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said states should be allowed to declare bankruptcy instead (which may not be constitutional). This leaves states struggling to balance budgets largely on their own.

Prepare for pain

With tax increases politically unfeasible at the moment, states will have little choice but to impose big spending cuts. Ohio’s governor has instructed state agencies to chop their budgets by 20% in the coming fiscal year. In Washington state, the reduction is 15%. California’s governor and legislators are deadlocked over plans for $14bn of spending cuts, but even these would not be enough to close the expected $54bn deficit. Spending cuts imply lay-offs. The states have already furloughed or sacked 1.5m workers in March, April and May, twice as many as in 2009-11.

Such cuts will be a drag on growth when recovery starts. As Pew’s Josh Goodman points out, states were reining back spending years after the Great Recession, resulting, as late as 2018, in shortages of teachers, and infrastructure spending at 50-year lows as a share of GDP. The budget squeeze now will be greater than it was then. And remember what programmes are provided by states: Medicaid at a time of covid; unemployment insurance at a time of recession; policing at a time of protest. In the absence of proper presidential leadership, governors such as Maryland’s Larry Hogan and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer have provided much of what useful guidance America has had during the pandemic. But they, and other governors, must now brace themselves for the coming crash.
