== Godfathers depart, too

(eco 2020-5-30 / Business / Asian business dynasties: Godfathers depart, too)

Why Asian business dynasties struggle with succession

Stanley Ho, a Macau casino magnate, who died on May 26th, aged 98, offers clues

May 28th 2020 |


MACAU WILL become the “Las Vegas of the Far East”, predicted Sheldon Adelson, an American casino magnate. In 2019 the Chinese territory’s $30bn in annual casino revenue was five times Vegas’s. Despite a slump in turnover this year as covid-19 emptied parlours(n.), Macau’s rise looks poised(a.) to resume. It owes much to Stanley Ho, the charming scion(n.) of an illustrious Hong Kong clan. Thanks to the monopoly(n.) gambling licence he secured from Macau’s former Portuguese administrators in 1961 and held until 2002, STDM, his family’s main holding company, grew into Asia’s largest gambling empire.

Mr Ho died on May 26th, aged 98, leaving behind 14 children and a $6bn-plus fortune. A decade ago his last wife fought a bitter public battle against his second and third wives for control of SJM Holdings, the group’s publicly traded arm. His elder children joined the acrimonious spat, which ended in a truce.

Many Asian firms face similarly complex successions. Family concerns(n.) make up over half of all big businesses in Asia. Other recently departed patriarchs include Eka Tjipta Widjaja of Indonesia’s Sinar Mas Group, Henry Sy of SM Group in the Philippines /and Shin Kyuk-ho of South Korea’s Lotte Group. Many other businesses have ageing leaders. Experts foresee a wave of turbulence.

Many patriarchs fear that anointing(v.) an heir apparent would weaken their grip on power or bring bad luck. Because Asian business dynasties tend to be quite new, many lack the institutional structures of European or American ones.

A deeper problem is their relationship-based management model. Bosses cultivate a personal rapport(n.) with politicians and financiers, which does not easily transfer from one generation to the next. Joseph Fan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong finds that family firms in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan lose some 60% of their value during generational transitions.

Some of Asia’s geriatric bosses are keen to avoid this fate. Before retiring two years ago, Li Ka-shing, the 91-year-old doyen(n.) of corporate Hong Kong, simplified his web of businesses. He gave one of his sons clear control of CK Hutchinson Holdings and CK Asset Holdings, which contain most of his empire.

- 美国武装部队刚刚发生了一场小小的革命。他们首次部署了人工智能(AI)，以确定何时对黑鹰直升机进行全面检查。该算法根据维修记录和传感器数据进行训练，计算出飞机可以在沙漠等地安全飞行多长时间，然后才能清洗引擎，防止沙子融化成玻璃，导致引擎失效。


Such predictive 预测的；预言的；前瞻的 maintenance *is* the most tangible(a.)有形的；实际的；真实的,能够清晰被看到和存在的 product [so far] of the Joint AI Centre (JAIC). With 176 employees and an expected budget of $240m next fiscal year, up from $90m in this one, it *lies* at the heart of an ambitious effort *to use* machine learning and other AI *to help* the Pentagon *run more efficiently* and *keep its technological edge*, especially *over* China.

So Nand Mulchandani, JAIC’s technology chief and a noted Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur 连续创业者, *wants* the group *to function*(v.)起作用；正常工作；运转 *a bit like* a venture-capital fund. That *means* investing(v.) in “product teams”, internal startups *of sorts* （表示某事物不够好）勉强算的，凑合的, which *develop* prototype applications  that *can then be scaled up* 增大，扩大（规模或数量） by outside contractors 承包人；承包商；承包公司.

- *of sorts* :( informal ) used when you are saying that sth is not a good example of a particular type of thing （表示某事物不够好）勉强算的，凑合的 +
-> He offered us *an apology of sorts*. 他给我们勉强道了个歉。

- 正如许多公司的老板们从惨痛的教训中所学到的那样，如果没有正确的使用过程，最好的技术就没有多大价值。因此，JAIC的技术主管Nand Mulchandani希望该集团的运作有点像风险投资基金。Mulchandani是硅谷著名的连续创业者。这意味着投资于“产品团队”，即内部创业公司，开发原型应用程序，然后由外部承包商进行扩展。

- 该组织距离“任务完成”还有很长的路要走。有些问题是五角大楼特有的。Jaic还在等待自己的处理能力，这一能力一直被亚马逊的法律挑战所阻碍；这家科技巨头辩称，它的云服务被不公平地忽略了，转而有利于微软的竞争对手。JAIC还没有摆脱国防部采购官僚机构的毒牙：如果它不能签署自己的合同，它将无法足够快地采取行动。而且，当它从直升机维护或预测森林火灾等没有争议的项目转向更棘手的项目时，必须小心不要让私营部门的合作伙伴望而却步。例如，“联合作战行动”加速了“传感器到射手”的循环-从发现目标到受到攻击所需的时间。(谷歌似乎不再感到不安：它最近赢得了向五角大楼提供云软件的合同。)


Other issues *will sound familiar* to chief executives. *Recruiting* data scientists `系` *is* tough; most *would rather work for* big tech, not big government.

Business lessons(n.) from the Pentagon

How to introduce advanced technology into a stodgy(a.) organisation

May 28th 2020 | ARLINGTON


A SMALL REVOLUTION has just occurred in America’s armed forces. They have, for the first time, deployed artificial intelligence (AI) to determine when a thorough(a.) check-up of a Black Hawk helicopter is in order. The algorithm, trained on maintenance records and sensor data, calculates how long the aircraft can fly safely in, say, a desert, before its engines should be cleaned to prevent(v.) sand melting into glass that could cause them to fail.

Such predictive maintenance is the most tangible product [so far] of the Joint AI Centre (JAIC). With 176 employees and an expected budget of $240m next fiscal year, up from $90m in this one, it lies at the heart of an ambitious effort to use machine learning and other AI to help the Pentagon run more efficiently and keep its technological edge, especially over China.

Yet when its first director, Lieutenant-General Jack Shanahan, steps down on June 1st, JAIC’s main output will [not] be whizz-bang software or even weapons, [but] infrastructure to develop them. “I did not want to create a classic insurgency organisation, but one that survives me,” says Lieut-General Shanahan. `主` The way he has gone about it `谓` offers a case study in how large organisations struggle to adopt advanced technology.

Like many company bosses, top brass at the Department of Defence (DoD) in recent years began feeling technologically inadequate. Not just China but Western tech giants were showing them up, in particular Google. So in 2017 the Pentagon’s Defence Innovation Board (DIB), chaired by Eric Schmidt, who was also executive chairman of Google’s parent, Alphabet, at the time, called for JAIC’s creation. A year later the DIB got its way -- ironically around the same time that mostly pacifist(n.) Googlers pushed their bosses to abandon work for “Project Maven”, a DoD effort to analyse drone footage.

Things have moved surprisingly briskly since, by the DoD’s sluggish(a.) standards. JAIC ranks are set to almost double within a few years, to 300 or so. Its budget is now assured until 2025. Like many corporations flirting with innovation, it has hired outside help, recently signing its first big contract, worth $800m over five years, with Booz Allen Hamilton, an information-technology consultancy.

Booz Allen’s job will be to pull together JAIC’s IT infrastructure into something like a workbench to build AI applications. This will tap various sources of data, AI’s lifeblood, from a helicopter’s sensors to the DoD’s supply-chain software. It will provide the computing power to crunch them. And it will offer software tools that let developers create, test and run AI systems.

As many corporate bosses have learned the hard way, the best technology is not worth much without the right processes to use it. So Nand Mulchandani, JAIC’s technology chief and a noted(a.) Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur, wants the group to function a bit like a venture-capital fund. That means investing(v.) in “product teams”, internal startups of sorts, which develop prototype applications that can then be scaled up by outside contractors.

The group is still a long way from “mission accomplished”. Some problems are specific to the Pentagon. JAIC still awaits its own processing power, which has been held up by a legal challenge from Amazon; the tech giant argues that its cloud service was unfairly passed over in favour of Microsoft’s rival offering. JAIC has yet to extricate itself from the fangs of the DoD’s procurement bureaucracy: if it cannot sign its own contracts, it will not be able to move fast enough. And it must be careful not to put off private-sector partners as it moves [from] uncontroversial projects such as helicopter maintenance or forecasting forest fires [to] thornier ones. “Joint warfighting operations”, for instance, accelerate the “sensor-to-shooter” loop -- the time it takes (from spotting a target until it is attacked). (Google no longer seems fazed: it recently won a Pentagon contract to provide pieces of cloud software.)

Other issues will sound familiar to chief executives. Recruiting data scientists is tough; most would rather work for big tech, not big government. The DoD’s digital collections are, like many legacy corporate systems, a shambles, as the RAND Corporation, a think-tank, concluded in a recent report. Data are often thrown away or stored locally (the initial Maven drone footage had to be collected at bases on CD-ROMs). They come in all sorts of formats and are badly catalogued. As in many big companies, a chief data officer is supposed(v.) to sort(v.) these things out, but can expect resistance. “Personnel might view data as a means of retaining power,” write the RAND authors.

Lieut-General Shanahan is proud of his work. So are early JAIC supporters like Mr Schmidt. He has since left Alphabet but still chairs the DIB -- and calls the general a “real American hero” for getting as far as he has. `主` Whoever takes over at JAIC [nevertheless](ad.) `谓` has their work cut out -- as does Mr Mulchandani, who will stand in as director until the Senate confirms a military replacement, which may take some time. As Robert Work, a tech-savvy former deputy defence secretary, puts it: “The foundation is in place; now all they have to do is execute.” Many bosses know the feeling.
