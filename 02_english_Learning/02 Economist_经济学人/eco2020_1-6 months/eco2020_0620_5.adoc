The clock *is ticking* 发出滴答声；滴答地走时 for `nuclear arms control`

Avoidable(a.) Armageddon （足以毁灭世界的）大决战

Jun 20th 2020 |

- START : ACRONYM 首字母缩略词 for `Strategic Arms` Reduction Talks 削减战略武器会谈

- Armageddon :  /ˌɑːrməˈɡedn/ ( in the Bible 《圣经》 ) a battle between good and evil at the end of the world 世界末日的善恶大决战  / a terrible war that could destroy the world （足以毁灭世界的）大决战 +
=> 在《圣经》的“启示录”中提到，世界末日来临之时，以上帝为代表的善, 和以撒旦代表的恶, 两股势力将在一个叫做Armageddon（哈米吉多顿）的地方展开决战。Armageddon这个词来自于希伯来语中一座名为“米吉多”的山 （Megiddo，位于现今的以色列）。 +

Without agreement *to extend it*, the treaty *will expire* on February 5th 2021.

- 美俄之间最后的核武器控制条约, 已经时日无多。新的《削减战略武器条约》限制了两国的远程核武器武库，并允许相互检查。如果没有达成延长协议，该条约将于2021年2月5日到期。

*That is not the only reason* why `主` the five-yearly review` of the 50-year-old `Nuclear Non-Proliferation(激增；涌现；增殖；大量的事物)限制核武器和化学武器的增加；防止核扩散 Treaty`, (*scheduled* this spring) (but *postponed* because of covid-19), `谓` *promises(v.)使很可能；预示 to be* bitter 味苦的;令人不快的；使人悲痛的；由痛苦引起的(比较级).

- 对已有50年历史的《核不扩散条约》(Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty)进行五年一次的审议，原定于今年春天进行，但由于covid-19的原因而被推迟。但这并不是《核不扩散条约》很可能前进黯淡的唯一原因. 无核国家抱怨说，被允许拥有核武器的P5国家没有履行自己的承诺，没有真诚地来努力放弃核武器。对核问题的担忧正在加剧。联合国裁军副秘书长Izumi Nakamitsu Izumi警告称，无论是因为双方误判,还是其他的什么原因，核战爆发的风险, 正处于“自冷战高峰以来的最高水平”。

- 土耳其总理雷杰普•塔伊普•埃尔多安(Recep Tayyip Erdogan)曾公开谈论此事。为了占领道德和法律制高点，80多个国家签署了禁止核武器条约，一旦50个国家批准该条约，该条约将立即生效。而拥有核武器的国家将会忽略它。


[Even during `the cold war`] America and Russia *managed to reach nuclear deals*. They *signed* their first such treaty, SALT I, in 1972. But recently *accords(n.)协议；条约 have been falling(v.) apart* 破碎；破裂；崩溃. `The Intermediate-range 中间范围的;中程 Nuclear Forces Treaty` *collapsed* last August, *because of* Russian cheating. New START’s demise(n.)死亡;终止；失败；倒闭 *would open the way for* a new nuclear arms race, amid *worries about* emerging threats(n.) (from hypersonic weapons). This *comes* [*on top of* 除…之外 growing concerns about `future conventional (尤指武器)非核的；常规的 systems *controlled by artificial intelligence*`].

- demise => de-, 向下，离开。-mis, 送出，词源同mission. 委婉语。

- *on top of sth/sb* : in addition to sth 除…之外 / very close to sth/sb 紧挨着；与…紧靠着
.. He gets commission *on top of his salary*. 他除了薪金之外, 还拿佣金。
.. *We were all living [on top of each other]* in that tiny apartment. 我们都挤着住在那套小小的公寓里。

- 即使在冷战期间，美国和俄罗斯也设法达成了核协议。两国在1972年签署了第一个这样的条约，即《第一阶段战略武器限制条约》。但最近，协议在消亡。由于俄罗斯的欺骗，《中程核力量条约》于去年8月破裂。在人们担忧高超音速武器威胁之际，《新削减战略武器条约》(New START)的终结, 将为一场新的核军备竞赛开辟道路。此外，人们对未来由人工智能控制的"传统武器系统", 也日益感到担忧。

Russia *says* `it *wants to extend* New START`, but Mr Trump `*dislikes* the treaty`, *partly because* it was signed in 2010 by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and *more reasonably 公平合理地;合乎逻辑地 because* it does not restrain(v.) China, which `*has* a smaller nuclear arsenal` but one (that is getting larger and fancier(a.)复杂的；昂贵的；精致的(fancy的比较级)). Mr Trump `*favours* a bigger treaty`, *including* China. His arms-control envoy 使者；使节；（谈判等的）代表, Marshall Billingslea, *has said that*, if Russia *wants* an extension, it *must bring China to the table*. But China *shows no interest in* letting itself be tied down. Some *suspect that* `主` Mr Trump’s insistence(n.)坚决要求；坚持；固执 on `three-way talks` `系` *is* a poison pill 毒药丸（比喻公司为避免被对方兼并而向对方索取极高代价的阻挠措施）, *allowing* America *to engage in* （使）从事，参加 `a nuclear race` that hawks *think* it would win.

- *poison pill* :  n. ( informal ) ( business 商 ) a form of defence used by a company to prevent, or to reduce the effect of, a takeover bid that they do not want, for example by selling some of their important possessions （公司为防止被兼并, 而采取的）自戕式防御；（出售某些重要财产, 以求最终自保的）掏空政策 +

-  俄罗斯表示希望延长《新削减战略武器条约》(New START)，但特朗普不喜欢该条约，部分原因是该条约是他的前任巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)在2010年签署的，更合理的原因是, 该条约没有对中国进行约束。中国的核武库规模较小，但正变得越来越大，越来越有复杂。特朗普倾向于一个更大的条约，包括中国。他的武器控制特使马歇尔·比林斯拉(Marshall Billingslea)曾表示，如果俄罗斯想要延长谈判期限，就必须把中国拉到谈判桌前。但中国没有表现出让自己受到束缚的兴趣。一些人怀疑，特朗普对三方会谈的坚持, 是一颗毒丸，目的是让美国加入一场核竞赛, 而美国鹰派认为他们会获胜。(军控专家说，特朗普将中国纳入新条约的提议，是一项扼杀《新削减战略武器条约》, 并去除美国核武器部署限制的“毒丸”战略。)


New START *can be extended for five years* by mutual agreement (with *no need* to ask Congress). Arms-control advocates 拥护者；支持者；提倡者  *say* this *would buy time for* a wider future deal *involving* China, and perhaps *including* all types of nukes. Russia *might insist that* the smaller British and French arsenals *be counted* in any such negotiations, if `主` limits(n.) on the numbers of weapons `谓` *were reduced [much further]*. There is plenty here [for the P5] *to work on* 努力改善（或完成）, if they *could only get round to it* 抽出时间来做某事.

- *get round/around to sth* : to find the time to do sth 抽出时间来做某事 +
-> I hope *to get around* to answering your letter next week.
我希望下周能抽出时间给你回信。

- 新的《削减战略武器条约》可以在双方同意的情况下延长5年(无需向国会请示)。主张军备控制的人士说，这将为未来涉及中国的更广泛的协议, 赢得时间，或许还能包括所有类型的核武器。如果对武器数量的限制进一步减少，俄罗斯可能会坚持在任何此类谈判中都将规模较小的英国和法国的武器库计算在内。如果P5能抽出时间来解决这个问题，这里就有很多工作要做。

== New START’s end?

The clock is ticking for nuclear arms control

Avoidable Armageddon

Jun 20th 2020 |


TIME IS RUNNING out for the last remaining nuclear arms-control treaty between America and Russia. New START limits their arsenals of long-range nukes and allows intrusive mutual inspections. Without agreement to extend it, the treaty will expire on February 5th 2021.

That is not the only reason why the five-yearly review of the 50-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, scheduled this spring but postponed because of covid-19, promises to be bitter. Nuclear have-nots complain that the P5 countries permitted to have nukes are not keeping their side of the bargain, to work in good faith towards giving them up. Nuclear fears are rising. Whether through miscalculation or otherwise, the risk of a nuclear detonation is at its “highest since the peak of the cold war”, warns Nakamitsu Izumi, the UN’s undersecretary-general for disarmament.

Donald Trump has pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran. His nuclear summitry with North Korea has stalled. If constraints are seen to be failing, more countries may feel tempted to go nuclear. Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan has mused aloud about it. Seeking to occupy the moral and legal high ground, more than 80 countries have signed a Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which will come into force once 50 have ratified it. The nuclear haves will ignore it.



Even during the cold war America and Russia managed to reach nuclear deals. They signed their first such treaty, SALT I, in 1972. But recently accords have been falling apart. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty collapsed last August, because of Russian cheating. New START’s demise would open the way for a new nuclear arms race, amid worries about emerging threats from hypersonic weapons. This comes on top of growing concerns about future conventional systems controlled by artificial intelligence.

Russia says it wants to extend New START, but Mr Trump dislikes the treaty, partly because it was signed in 2010 by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and more reasonably because it does not restrain China, which has a smaller nuclear arsenal but one that is getting larger and fancier. Mr Trump favours a bigger treaty, including China. His arms-control envoy, Marshall Billingslea, has said that, if Russia wants an extension, it must bring China to the table. But China shows no interest in letting itself be tied down. Some suspect that Mr Trump’s insistence on three-way talks is a poison pill, allowing America to engage in a nuclear race that hawks think it would win.

New START can be extended for five years by mutual agreement (with no need to ask Congress). Arms-control advocates say this would buy time for a wider future deal involving China, and perhaps including all types of nukes. Russia might insist that the smaller British and French arsenals be counted in any such negotiations, if limits on the numbers of weapons were reduced much further. There is plenty here for the P5 to work on, if they could only get round to it.

`主` The UN’s structures *built* in 1945 `系` *are not fit for 2020*, let alone 更不用说 *beyond* it

Grand redesigns

Jun 20th 2020 |


“[IF YOU *DIDN’T have* the UN] you *really would have to reinvent it*,” says Stephen Schlesinger, author of `a history of its founding`. Maybe, but nobody (*in their right mind* 精神正常（或不正常）) *would design* it [*as it exists(v.) today*]. Insiders  知内情者；内部的人 *complain of* a tangle 乱糟糟的一堆;混乱；纷乱 of overlapping （物体）部分重叠，交叠 agencies, senseless silos 筒仓；青贮窖；飞弹发射井 and barricaded 设路障防护；阻挡 budgets. “If you *locked* `a team of evil geniuses` *in* a laboratory 实验室；实验大楼, they *could not design* a bureaucracy *so maddeningly 使人恼火地；令人发狂地 complex*,” one departing 离开；离去 official *despaired* 绝望. Outsiders *face a forbidding confusion* of agencies(n.) with acronyms 首字母缩略词. Many *do great work* (WFP and UNHCR), others *have a mixed 混合的；混杂的 record* (WHO and FAO), a few *are useless* (UNIDO). And at the top the structure *reflects* the world of 1945, *as if* `little *had changed [since]*`.

- *(not) in your right mind* : (not) mentally normal 精神正常（或不正常）

- silo : /ˈsaɪloʊ/ a tall tower on a farm used for storing grain, etc. 筒仓 / an underground place where nuclear weapons or dangerous substances are kept （核武器的）发射井；（危险物品的）地下贮藏库 / an underground place where silage is made and stored 青贮窖 +
=> 来自西班牙语 silo,地窖，来自拉丁语 sirus,地窖，来自希腊语 siros,地窖，谷物存放窖。后用 于指存放草料的窖，核武器发射井等。 +

- WFP : abbr. （联合国）世界粮食计划署（World Food Program（me））

- UNHCR : /ˌjuː en ˌeɪtʃ siː ˈɑːr/ abbr. 联合国难民事务高级专员（United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees）

- WHO  : 世界卫生组织，世卫组织（World Health Organization）

- FAO : 联合国粮食及农业组织，联合国粮农组织（Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations）

- UNIDO : /,ju:'ni:dəu/ abbr. 联合国工业发展组织（United Nations Industrial Development Organization）

- 《联合国成立历史》一书的作者斯蒂芬•施莱辛格(Stephen Schlesinger)表示:“如果没有联合国，你就真的得重新创造它。”也许吧，但没有人会把它设计成今天的样子。内部人士抱怨重叠的机构、毫无意义的“竖井”和障碍的预算。“如果你把一群邪恶的天才关在实验室里，他们也不可能设计出如此复杂的官僚机构，”一位即将离任的官员绝望地说。外部人士面临着令人生畏的机构, 还有缩写词的混淆。许多机构工作出色(粮食计划署, 和难民专员办事处)，其他机构的记录好坏参半(卫生组织, 和粮农组织)，少数机构则毫无用处(工发组织)。联合国顶层的架构设计, 反映了1945年的世界，似乎自那以后几乎没有什么变化。


This *was not* `表` what the founders *envisaged*(v.)想象；设想；展望`. *Hailing* 赞扬（或称颂）…为…（尤用于报章等） the charter 宪章，章程, Truman *said* it *had “not been poured into* a fixed mould 模具；铸模;（独特）类型，个性，风格”, but *would be adjusted* [*in line with* 与…相似（或紧密相连） changing conditions]. [In fact] the only changes *have been* minor ones, *to take account of* the growth of UN membership. In 1965 the Security Council *expanded from 11 members to 15*. But whereas （用以比较或对比两个事实）然而，但是，尽管;（用于正式文件中句子的开头）鉴于 it *included* 22% of `General Assembly(n.)立法机构；会议；议会 members` in 1945, it now *has* just 8%. Its veto-wielding 在国际组织中投票时拥有否决权的 P5 *remain* `the victorious powers` of 75 years ago, with no representation from Latin America, Africa or South Asia. Without change, the legitimacy 合法；合理；正统 gap *will only grow*.

- *in line with sth* : similar to sth or so that one thing is closely connected with another 与…相似（或紧密相连） +
-> Annual pay increases will be in line with inflation. 每年加薪幅度将与通货膨胀挂钩。

- General Assembly 联合国大会(脸大). 是联合国的主要审查、审议和监督机构。

|===
|联合国大会 |安理会

|联合国的193个会员国全部一国一票
|5个常任理事国 + 10个非常任理事国
|===

- 这不是创始人们所设想的。杜鲁门称赞该宪章时，表示，它“没有被倒入一个固定的模具”，而是将根据不断变化的情况进行调整。事实上，考虑到联合国成员国数量的增长，唯一的变化都是很小的。1965年，安理会从11个成员国扩大到15个。1945年，安理会成员国数量/联合国大会的成员国数量=22%，而现在只占8%。拥有否决权的P5仍然是75年前的战胜国，没有来自拉丁美洲、非洲或南亚的代表。没有改变，合法性差距只会扩大。


*This might matter(v.)事关紧要；要紧；有重大影响 less* [if the council *were working effectively*], but *it is not*. There *have been* worse periods. In 1959 the council *passed* just one resolution, *to appoint* a committee *to report* on Laos 老挝. “By historical standards, this is still `a reasonably 尚可；过得去 active institution` （大学、银行等规模大的）机构,” says Mr Gowan of the ICG 国际危机组织(International Crisis Group). But *it is increasingly crippled* 使残废；使跛；使成瘸子;严重毁坏（或损害） by great-power rivalry 竞争；竞赛；较量. The relationship between the three biggest powers, America, China and Russia, “*has never been `表` as dysfunctional(a.)机能失调的；功能障碍的 as* it is today,” says Mr Guterres.

- 如果安理会有效地工作，这一点可能不那么重要，但事实并非如此。也有过更糟糕的时期。1959年，理事会仅通过了一项决议，即任命一个委员会来报告老挝的情况。ICG的Gowan先生说:“以历史标准来看，这仍然是一个相当活跃的机构。”但它正日益受到大国竞争的削弱。古特雷斯说，美国、中国和俄罗斯这三大大国之间的关系“从未像今天这样运转不良”。

Veto 否决权 use(n.) *has risen*. [In the past five years] Russia *has wielded 14 vetoes*, China *five* and America *two* (Britain and France *have refrained 克制；节制；避免 from using theirs* since 1989). [*In response to* the Ebola crisis in west Africa in 2014] the Security Council *passed a resolution* calling(v.) the outbreak 宾补 “a threat to `international peace and security`”. [Over covid-19] it *dithered(v.)犹豫不决；踌躇 for weeks* and then *struggled to agree to a resolution* (calling for `a 90-day pause in hostilities` 战争行为;敌意；对抗 in conflict-ridden(a.)(充满（某种不良事物）的；满是…的)冲突四起的 countries), as China and America *quarrelled 争吵；吵嘴；吵架 over* whether *to refer to* the WHO (China *said yes*, *knowing* America would say no). *Instead of* *putting*(v.) momentum 推进力；动力；势头 *behind* the secretary-general’s 秘书长 ceasefire appeal 呼吁，吁请，恳求, the council *stayed paralysed* 使瘫痪.

- dither : /ˈdɪðər/ => 来自古英语didderen变体，踌躇，蹒跚。词源可能同dawdle, diddle, doodle, doddle.


- 否决权的使用有所增加。在过去的五年里，俄罗斯动用了14张否决票，中国5张，美国2张(英国和法国自1989年以来, 就没有动用过否决权)。为了应对2014年西非的埃博拉危机，安理会通过了一项决议，称该疫情是“对国际和平与安全的威胁”。在covid-19问题上，安理会犹豫了几周，后来又努力同意了一项要求冲突不断的国家, 停火90天的决议，而中国和美国则在是否要提及世界卫生组织的问题上, 争论不休(中国答应了，而美国肯定会说不)。安理会非但没有推动秘书长的停火呼吁，反而陷于瘫痪。

Its credibility 可信性；可靠性 *is slipping* 下降；退步；变差;滑倒；滑跤. The arms embargo 禁止贸易令；禁运 on Libya *is ignored*. Russia’s behaviour *is a big worry*. “The existential 关于人类存在的；与人类存在有关的 problem *is that* `主` countries `谓` *respect*(v.) the decisions of `the Security Council` [*less and less* 越来越少；越来越少的],” says Karen Pierce, until recently Britain’s ambassador at the UN, now its ambassador in Washington. [Normally] the P5 *is* there *to uphold 支持，维护（正义等） the rules*, says Ms Pierce, but, *referring to* Russia’s support for Syria, “`主` for a P5 member *to think* {*it*’s OK *to condone* 宽恕；饶恕；纵容 the use of chemical weapons} `系` *is* quite a major shift.”

- condone => con-, 强调。-don, 给予，词源同donate, date. 即完全给予的，原谅的，比较pardon.

- 它的可信度正在下滑。对利比亚的武器禁运被忽视了。俄罗斯的行为令人担忧。“存在的问题是，各国越来越不尊重安理会的决定，”英国驻联合国大使卡伦•皮尔斯(Karen Pierce)说。皮尔斯最近一直担任英国驻联合国大使，现在是英国驻华盛顿大使。皮尔斯表示，通常情况下，五个常任理事国的职责是维护规则，但在涉及俄罗斯对叙利亚的支持问题上，“五个常任理事国认为, 使用化学武器是可以被宽恕的，这就是一个相当大的转变了。”

*Could* reform *help*? 目的状 *To ensure that* `the council *remains representative*`(a.)代表各类人（或事物）的;典型的；有代表性的, *suggests* Stewart Patrick of `the Council on Foreign Relations`, an American think-tank, “*ideally* you’*d have something* like `the Premier 首要的；最著名的；最成功的；第一的 League` 英超联赛, *with* relegation 贬谪；驱逐 and promotion （体育运动队的）晋级，升级.” But *try agreeing on a formula* 公式;方案；方法. For over a decade, `an intergovernmental 政府间的 group` at the UN *has grappled 扭打；搏斗;努力设法解决 with* `how the council *might take* [in more countries]`. Which ones? *Should* they *be permanent with a veto*, or non-permanent without one? Or perhaps `something in-between`, with longer non-permanent terms?

- 改革可以帮助吗?美国智库外交关系委员会的斯图尔特•帕特里克表示，为了确保该委员会保持代表性，“最理想的情况是像英超那样，有降级也有晋升。”但试着商定一个公式。十多年来，联合国的一个政府间组织一直在努力解决安理会如何接纳更多国家的问题。哪一个?他们应该是拥有否决权的常任理事国，还是没有否决权的非常任理事国?或者可能是介于两者之间的更长的非常任期限?

A group of four (G4) countries `with the strongest claims to the top table` （正式宴会上的）主桌 -- Brazil, Germany, India and Japan -- *are keen(a.) to get a move on*. Africans *see it as* a historical injustice that *they did not get a permanent seat [at the outset 从开始]*, but their own rivalries *stop(v.) them `specifying* which countries they would pick`, so *they stick(v.) with an overall demand*(n.) for `two permanent seats` *plus* an expansion of `non-permanent ones`. Another group of a dozen countries *wary of* （对待人或事物时）小心的，谨慎的，留神的，小心翼翼的 the G4, including Argentina, Italy, Pakistan and South Korea, *argue against* expansion of permanent members *and [instead] want* more non-permanent ones. One approach *could be* `表` *to look at* 思考；考虑；研究 non-permanent ones first, and *come back to* the permanent ones later. But the G4 *resist* 抵制；阻挡 this *as* a recipe 方法；秘诀；诀窍 for *denying* 拒绝；拒绝给予 their claims.

- *look at sth* : (2) to think about, consider or study sth 思考；考虑；研究 +
-> The implications of the new law will *need to be looked at*. 新法规可能造成的影响, 需要仔细研究一下。 +
(3) to view or consider sth in a particular way （用某种方式）看待，考虑 +
-> *Looked at* [from that point of view], his decision is easier to understand. 从那个角度来看，他的决定比较容易理解。


- 巴西、德国、印度和日本这四国集团(G4), 是呼声最强想要进入常任理事国的国家，它们迫切希望取得进展。非洲人认为，他们一开始就没有获得常任理事国席位, 是一种历史上的不公正，但他们自己彼此的竞争, 使他们无法明确选择出哪个非洲国家，所以他们坚持要求两个常任理事国席位, 外加扩大数量的非常任理事国席位。另外一些对G4持谨慎态度的国家，包括阿根廷、意大利、巴基斯坦和韩国，反对增加常任理事国席位，而希望增加更多的非常任理事国。一种方法是可以先考虑增加非常任理事国，然后再回到增加常任理事国问题上。但G4拒绝他们的提议。

- 2004年日、德、印及巴四国联合组成“四国联盟”，借由安理会改造的机会积极争取成为常任理事国。但每个国家都遭到他国反对. 最后，四国联盟作出让步，提出争取六个无否决权的常任理事国议席，四个归属四国联盟，其余两个给与两个非洲国家；但由于非洲国家一直争取有否决权的常任理事国，故难以获非洲国家支持。但是新增常任理事国的新方案依然没能获通过。

If new permanent members *were agreed to*, a bigger Security Council *might not be more effective*

In this process, you *get* “some of `the most creative, passionate 热诚的；狂热的, articulate 善于表达的 speeches` that I *see* permanent representatives *give*,” says Lana Nusseibeh, `the United Arab Emirates’ 埃米尔(阿拉伯国家的贵族头衔)的管辖地；酋长国 ambassador` to the UN, who *co-chairs*(v.)担任议会的联合主席 the intergovernmental 政府间的 group, “because this issue *speaks to* their `core national interests` 国家的核心利益.”  And *even if* new permanent members *were agreed to*, a bigger Security Council *might not be more effective*. Any change *needs* an amendment （法律、文件的）改动，修正案，修改，修订 of the charter 宪章，章程, which *requires* the votes of two-thirds of the General Assembly and the approval of the current P5. In short, many stars 最优秀（或出色、成功）者 *would have to align* 排整齐；校准；（尤指）使成一条直线. In the meantime, lesser changes *could help*. For example, many *would like* the Security Council *to become more transparent* in its work.

- 即使安理会同意了新的常任理事国，一个更大的安理会可能也不会更有效率。任何改变都需要对《宪章》进行修改，这需要联合国大会三分之二的赞成票，以及目前P5国家的批准。简而言之，许多新星国家将不得不排队。与此同时，对联合国较小的改变, 可能会更有帮助。例如，许多国家都希望安理会在其工作中, 要更加透明。

- 对联合国秘书处本身来说，改革也是一项艰巨的任务。成员国拥有权力，这限制了行动的自由，尤其是在预算方面。大约30亿美元的经常预算(另有一个用于维和的预算)依赖于国家捐款，其分摊方式主要基于经济规模。尽管中国增长迅速，超过日本，但美国仍以22%的份额独占鳌头。一旦预算确定，各国应在30天内付清。但大约30%的资金是在每年的最后两个月发放的，这就造成了9月份出现资金短缺的风险，而此时正是联合国大会召开之时。它的储备只有大约3.5亿美元，而且不允许借贷。去年，为了节省现金，纽约总部一度关闭了自动扶梯。今年早些时候，对维和人员的付款被推迟。

- laboriously : /ləˈbɔːriəsli/ adv. 辛苦地；费力地；不流畅地

- 更糟糕的问题是预算的刚性。管理者不能把一个地方的积蓄用在另一个地方。所有决议都必须经过联合国官僚机构的严格审查，还要经过所谓的"第五委员会", 和一个听起来很好笑的"行政和预算问题咨询委员会"的审查。即使是更换一个中级职位，也需要得到所有193个国家的一致同意。第五委员会的一位西方外交官表示:“秘书长没有更多的灵活性，这太疯狂了。”

- 以萨赫勒国为例, 任何一个组织都无法单独解决该国的错综复杂的安全、发展和政治问题。需要与非洲联盟、非洲开发银行、世界银行和其他机构合作。古特雷斯表示，联合国与非盟的合作“在所有领域都非常出色”，而且与世界银行(World Bank)和国际货币基金组织(IMF)的合作比以往更深。所以他认为这方面的工作已经步入正轨。但在"包容性"方面却没。控制着多边机构的国家政府, 拒绝让企业、工会、非政府组织、城市和地方政府发出任何声音。古特雷斯正以联合国75周年纪念为理由机会, 发起一场开放全球治理的运动。

== Reform

The UN’s structures built in 1945 are not fit for 2020, let alone beyond it

Grand redesigns

Jun 20th 2020 |


“IF YOU DIDN’T have the UN you really would have to reinvent it,” says Stephen Schlesinger, author of a history of its founding. Maybe, but nobody in their right mind would design it as it exists today. Insiders complain of a tangle of overlapping agencies, senseless silos and barricaded budgets. “If you locked a team of evil geniuses in a laboratory, they could not design a bureaucracy so maddeningly complex,” one departing official despaired. Outsiders face a forbidding confusion of agencies with acronyms. Many do great work (WFP and UNHCR), others have a mixed record (WHO and FAO), a few are useless (UNIDO). And at the top the structure reflects the world of 1945, as if little had changed since.

This was not what the founders envisaged. Hailing the charter, Truman said it had “not been poured into a fixed mould”, but would be adjusted in line with changing conditions. In fact the only changes have been minor ones, to take account of the growth of UN membership. In 1965 the Security Council expanded from 11 members to 15. But whereas it included 22% of General Assembly members in 1945, it now has just 8%. Its veto-wielding P5 remain the victorious powers of 75 years ago, with no representation from Latin America, Africa or South Asia. Without change, the legitimacy gap will only grow.

This might matter less if the council were working effectively, but it is not. There have been worse periods. In 1959 the council passed just one resolution, to appoint a committee to report on Laos. “By historical standards, this is still a reasonably active institution,” says Mr Gowan of the ICG. But it is increasingly crippled by great-power rivalry. The relationship between the three biggest powers, America, China and Russia, “has never been as dysfunctional as it is today,” says Mr Guterres.

Veto use has risen. In the past five years Russia has wielded 14 vetoes, China five and America two (Britain and France have refrained from using theirs since 1989). In response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa in 2014 the Security Council passed a resolution calling the outbreak “a threat to international peace and security”. Over covid-19 it dithered for weeks and then struggled to agree to a resolution calling for a 90-day pause in hostilities in conflict-ridden countries, as China and America quarrelled over whether to refer to the WHO (China said yes, knowing America would say no). Instead of putting momentum behind the secretary-general’s ceasefire appeal, the council stayed paralysed.

Its credibility is slipping. The arms embargo on Libya is ignored. Russia’s behaviour is a big worry. “The existential problem is that countries respect the decisions of the Security Council less and less,” says Karen Pierce, until recently Britain’s ambassador at the UN, now its ambassador in Washington. Normally the P5 is there to uphold the rules, says Ms Pierce, but, referring to Russia’s support for Syria, “for a P5 member to think it’s OK to condone the use of chemical weapons is quite a major shift.”



Could reform help? To ensure that the council remains representative, suggests Stewart Patrick of the Council on Foreign Relations, an American think-tank, “ideally you’d have something like the Premier League, with relegation and promotion.” But try agreeing on a formula. For over a decade, an intergovernmental group at the UN has grappled with how the council might take in more countries. Which ones? Should they be permanent with a veto, or non-permanent without one? Or perhaps something in-between, with longer non-permanent terms?

A group of four (G4) countries with the strongest claims to the top table—Brazil, Germany, India and Japan—are keen to get a move on. Africans see it as a historical injustice that they did not get a permanent seat at the outset, but their own rivalries stop them specifying which countries they would pick, so they stick with an overall demand for two permanent seats plus an expansion of non-permanent ones. Another group of a dozen countries wary of the G4, including Argentina, Italy, Pakistan and South Korea, argue against expansion of permanent members and instead want more non-permanent ones. One approach could be to look at non-permanent ones first, and come back to the permanent ones later. But the G4 resist this as a recipe for denying their claims.

If new permanent members were agreed to, a bigger Security Council might not be more effective

In this process, you get “some of the most creative, passionate, articulate speeches that I see permanent representatives give,” says Lana Nusseibeh, the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the UN, who co-chairs the intergovernmental group, “because this issue speaks to their core national interests.” And even if new permanent members were agreed to, a bigger Security Council might not be more effective. Any change needs an amendment of the charter, which requires the votes of two-thirds of the General Assembly and the approval of the current P5. In short, many stars would have to align. In the meantime, lesser changes could help. For example, many would like the Security Council to become more transparent in its work.

To be the very model of a modern multilateral

In the UN secretariat itself, reform is also a hard slog. Power rests in the member countries, which limit freedom of manoeuvre, not least over the budget. The regular budget of about $3bn (there is a separate one for peacekeeping) relies on national contributions, assessed through a formula based largely on economic size. America’s share, at 22%, remains the biggest, though China’s has risen fast, overtaking Japan’s. Once the budget is set, countries are supposed to pay up within 30 days. But roughly 30% of the money comes in the final two months of the year, creating the risk of a cash crunch in September, just when the UN hosts its General Assembly. It has a reserve of only about $350m and is not allowed to borrow. Last year escalators were switched off for a while at the New York headquarters to conserve cash. Earlier this year payments for peacekeepers were delayed.



Worse still is the budget’s rigidity. Bosses cannot use savings in one area to spend in another. Decisions have to go laboriously through the bureaucracy, with scrutiny from something called the Fifth Committee and a fun-sounding Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. Even moving a mid-level post requires the unanimous approval of all 193 countries. “It’s crazy that the secretary-general doesn’t have more flexibility,” says one Western diplomat on the Fifth Committee.

Mr Guterres has sought to break down silos and improve co-ordination. But the pandemic has shown the need for a stronger form of governance, he believes. “Today we have a multilateralism that has no teeth,” he says, “and wherever there are teeth, as in the Security Council, there is no appetite to bite.” Multilateralism needs to evolve in two ways, he argues: it must become more “networked” and more “inclusive”. By networked he means working closely with other organisations, to achieve joined-up action on interconnected issues affecting a specific region or problem.

Take the Sahel. No single organisation can tackle its intertwined security, development and political troubles. Collaboration is needed with the African Union, the African Development Bank, the World Bank and other institutions. The UN’s co-operation with the AU is “fantastic in all areas”, Mr Guterres says, and that with the World Bank and IMF deeper than ever. So he reckons this side of things is already on track. But inclusivity is not. National governments that control multilateral institutions resist letting businesses, trade unions, NGOs, cities and regional administrations have any voice. Mr Guterres is using the 75th anniversary as an excuse for a campaign to open up global governance.
