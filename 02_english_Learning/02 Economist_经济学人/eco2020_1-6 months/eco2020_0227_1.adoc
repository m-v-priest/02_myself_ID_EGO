== 40. Indian v Chinese bosses in America Inc

A provocative(a.) study *examines* Asians in American corner offices

Feb 27th 2020 | NEW YORK


“A CAREER BOOK about Asians? *Aren’t* they *doing fine*…?” *So begins* “*Breaking* the Bamboo Ceiling”, a tome(n.) by Jane Hyun *published* in 2005. Because Asian-Americans *had* higher incomes and education levels /and *committed fewer crimes* than their average compatriot, they *were seen as* a model minority. Despite this, they *rarely rose to* the top of companies. `主` A mix of individual, cultural and organisational barriers -- the “bamboo ceiling” of the book’s title -- `谓` *seemed* to halt(v.) their rise.

Fifteen years later Asians *are* still under-represented(a.). Some 11% of associates(n.) at American law firms *are* Asian, but only 3% of partners *are*. [In technology] Asians *make up* over 30% of the workers *but* less than 15% of bosses. In 2017 Asians *made up* roughly 6% of the country’s population *but* only 3% (16) of the bosses of S&P 500 firms.

Some prominent Asians *run* big companies. Arvind Krishna *is* IBM’s new boss. Satya Nadella *runs* Microsoft and Sundar Pichai *leads* Alphabet. But few other Asians *have joined their ranks* -- and, revealingly, these stars *all have* Indian roots. There *are* fewer South Asians in America *than* East Asians, but they *still made up* 13 of those 16 Asian S&P 500 CEOs.



Why *are* there so few Asians *among* America’s business elite? And if a bamboo ceiling *is* to blame, why *do* South Asians *break through more easily*? These questions *are* the focus of a study by Jackson Lu of MIT Sloan School of Management and colleagues, who *surveyed* hundreds of senior executives and business-school students. They *found that* while discrimination *exists*, it *is not* destiny. South Asians *endure* greater racism *than* East Asians *but* still *outperform* even whites (if success *is weighed* against share of population). Their research *also rules out* lack of ambition: a greater share of Asians than whites(n.) *strive for* high-status jobs.

That *leaves* culture. The researchers *conclude that* South Asians *tend to be more assertive*(a.) [than East Asians] *in* how they *communicate* at work, which *fits* Western notions of how a leader *should behave*. The same propensity for confident discourse(n.) *featured* in “The Argumentative(a.) Indian”, a book by Amartya Sen, a Nobel-prizewinning(a.) economist. The researchers *attribute* East Asians’ reticence(n.) *to* Confucian values of modesty(n.) /and *respect for* hierarchy(a.). [Sometimes] boldness and bombast(n.) *are needed* to break(v.) bamboo.

== 41. When rank leads to rancour

How *not to give* employee feedback

Feb 27th 2020 |


IN DAVID MAMET’S film, “Glengarry Glen Ross”, a group of American property salesmen *are forced into* a contest *to maximise* sales. The top two *will get prizes*; the bottom two *will be fired*. The play *comes across as* a critique of the corrupting(a.) effect of “dog-eat-dog” capitalism /and *putting* performance *above* all else. But *is* competition (between employees) `表` an effective way of *improving* overall outcomes for business?

Jan Woike, from the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, and Sebastian Hafenbrädl, of the IESE business school in Barcelona, *try to answer the question* in an article for the Journal of Behavioural Decision Making. They *tested* whether performance ranking(n.) *helped or hindered* group effort.

Their approach *was* to use a “public goods” game *in which* participants *are given tokens*(n.) which they *can invest*. They *had* the choice of *investing in* an individual project or *investing collectively*. Two different versions of the game *were played*. [In both games] returns *were* higher [if everyone *collaborated*]. But in one version, `主` *investing in* the individual project `谓` *improved* the relative ranking of the participant, *even though* `主` the returns to both the individual and the group `系` *were* lower.

Participants(n.) in the game *included* some students and some experienced managers. The researchers *observed* no significant difference in the way (the two groups *played* the game). What mattered *was* the form of feedback. In one version of the game, individuals *were told* {how well they *scored*} and {how well they *were performing* relative to the rest of the group}. In another, they *were informed about* {how well the group [as a whole] *was performing*, relative to the maximum possible return}.

Predictably, the second feedback mechanism *led to* more co-operation. Less obviously, `主` information on individual performance *relative to* fellow group members `谓` *led* players *to favour* moving up the pecking order *over* [not just] their group’s collective returns, [but also] *over* their material wellbeing. They *were willing(a.) to forgo* guaranteed financial gains; `主` *achieving* “status” `系` *was* more important.

*As* the authors *note*, this result *has* implications *for* most organisations. “Ranking feedback, which *is often used* in organisational settings, *prompts* people *to perceive* even situations (with co-operative outcome structures) *as* competitive,” they *write*. People *may not be* innately co-operative(a.) or competitive(a.); they *may simply respond to* cues(n.) *set by* the organisation they *work for*.

Destructive competition *would be* a particular problem for those companies which *use* so-called “agile”(a.) management approaches, *in which* staff from different departments *are organised into teams* and *asked* to work together. Instead of *being agile*(a.), such teams *may wrestle* themselves *to* a standstill.

The research *also raises more questions about* a management approach, *dubbed* “rank and yank”, *under which* all employees *are rated yearly* /and `主` those who *fall into* the lowest category `系` *are liable*(a.) to lose their jobs. `主` Ranking systems of this kind, *associated with* Jack Welch’s tenure(n.) as boss of GE, an engineering giant, from 1981 to 2001, `谓` *have been* the subject *to increased* academic scrutiny(n.). Study after study *suggests that* they *hurt* overall performance, *not least* by *lowering* productivity.

Businesses *need to compete with* their rivals /but within the firm, co-operation *is* normally much more useful than competitive rivalry; `主` a house *divided against itself*, `谓` *cannot stand*, *as* Abraham Lincoln *said*. Competitive ranking *seems* [not just] *to reduce* co-operation and *foster* selfishness /[but also] *to discourage* risk-taking. Such findings *have prompted* many bosses *to yank*(v.) “rank and yank”. Microsoft *abandoned it* in 2013.

The Economist *is* a genuinely co-operative place (although Bartleby *is locked in* a Darwinian struggle with Schumpeter *for* the right to a full-page column). If it *wasn’t*, journalists *would be reluctant*(a.) *to pass on* contacts(n.) or story tips *to* their colleagues, and section editors *would constantly rubbish*(v.) the suggestions of their peers [*as it is*, we only *do* it occasionally, ed.].

[In “Glengarry Glen Ross”] two of the salesmen *conspire* to rob(v.) the office, *steal* some of the best sales leads(n.) and *sell* them *to* a rival business. If you *set up* a dog-eat-dog system, you *risk*(v.) having the hounds *turn around* and *bite* their owner.

“Rivals without a cause? Relative performance feedback *creates* destructive competition *despite* aligned incentives”
