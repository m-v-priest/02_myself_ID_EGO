中国发现的冠状病毒, 引起全球恐慌 +
可能导致的经济影响, 也令许多人担忧

(经济学人 2020.01.25 期, china / Viral pneumonia: The Wuhan crisis)


CHINA’S LEADER, Xi Jinping, often *warns* officials *to be wary*(a.)(`=*~ (of sb/sth) /~ (of doing sth)* : careful when dealing with sb/sth because you think that there may be a danger or problem （对待人或事物时）小心的，谨慎的，留神的，小心翼翼的`) *of* “black swan risks”, *meaning* sudden unexpected events that *can harm* the economy.

People *typically assume* he *means* wobbly(`=moving in an unsteady way from side to side 摇摆的；摇摇晃晃的`) banks or trade tensions. But the most immediate threat *may be* a new, sometimes deadly, virus that *appears to be spreading*.

The outbreak （战争的）爆发；（疾病的）发作 *raises* dark memories of another one 17 years ago that *killed* hundreds of people and, briefly, *nearly halted*(`=to stop; to make sb/sth stop （使）停止，停下`) China’s growth.

- wary => 来自 PIE wer,覆盖，保护，看管，看护，词源同 ward,ware.引申词义谨慎的。

中国领导人习近平, 经常警告官员要警惕“黑天鹅风险”，即可能损害经济的突发意外事件。人们通常认为, 他指的是摇摇欲坠的银行, 或贸易紧张的局势。但是最直接的威胁可能是一种新的，有时是致命的，似乎正在传播的病毒。此次疫情, 让人回想起17年前的另一场灾难，当时那场灾难, 导致数百人丧生，并在短时间内, 几乎让中国的经济增长陷入停滞。

The main worry *is* whether the government *can control* the virus, which *can cause* severe pneumonia(`=a serious illness affecting one or both lungs that makes breathing difficult 肺炎`).

The bug *is known as* 2019-nCoV, or more commonly, the Wuhan virus.

It *appears to have originated* 起源；发源；发端于 in early December in a fish and animal market in Wuhan, a city of 11m people.

On January 20th an official *said* `主` 14 health workers who *had treated* patients `系` *were* ill.

This *was* the first clear evidence that the disease *could pass from human to human* and therefore *spread more widely*.

====
- pneumonia => pneumon-,肺，-ia,炎症。
====

人们主要担心的是, 政府能否控制这种可导致严重肺炎的病毒。这种病毒被称为2019-nCoV，或更常见的名字"武汉病毒"。它似乎在12月初，起源于人口达1100万的武汉的一个鱼市和动物市场。1月20日，一名官员表示，14名曾治疗过病人的医护人员都生病了。这是首次明确的证据，表明这种疾病可以在人与人之间传播，因此传播范围更广。

[Between January 17th and 22nd] the number of confirmed infections 传染；感染 *grew* tenfold 十倍.

It *stood*(`=stand : *~ at sth* : to be at a particular level, amount, height, etc. 达特定水平（或数量、高度等）`) *at* 618 [as The Economist *went to* press(n.)印刷], of whom 17 *had died*.

There *are* cases(`= the fact of sb having a disease or an injury; a person suffering from a disease or an injury 病例；病案；病人；伤员`) in most of China’s provinces.

Infected travellers from China *have been found* in America, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.

[On January 23nd] Wuhan *declared* a travel ban. [Hours later] Wuhan’s *public* transport *was halted*, airports *closed* and expressways *blocked*.

A similar lockdown(n.)(`=a situation in which restrictions are placed on sb's movements or actions 活动（或行动）限制`) *was imposed on* two nearby cities, Ezhou and Huanggang.

1月17日至22日期间，确诊感染人数增长了10倍。截至《经济学人》付印，这一数字为618人，其中17人已经死亡。中国大部分省份都有这种情况。美国、日本、韩国、台湾和泰国, 都发现了来自中国的受感染旅客。1月23日，武汉宣布了一项旅行禁令。几个小时后，武汉的公共交通暂停，机场关闭，高速公路封锁。附近的鄂州和黄冈市也实施了类似的封锁。

This *has* echoes(n.)(`=the fact of an idea, event, etc. being like another and reminding you of it; sth that reminds you of sth else 映现；暗示；启示；反响`) of SARS, a respiratory(a.)(`=connected with breathing 呼吸的`) disease *also caused by* a coronavirus, the family *to* which the Wuhan virus *belongs*.

More than 8,000 people in China and other countries *contracted*(`= to get an illness 感染（疾病）；得（病）`) SARS between 2002 and 2003. *Close to* 10% of them *died*.

`主` Data *released* so far `谓` *suggest* the new virus *may be* less lethal(a.)(`=causing or able to cause death 致命的；可致死的`).

Officials *tried to cover up*(`=*cover sth up* : 掩盖（错误、罪行等的）真相; /to cover sth completely so that it cannot be seen （完全）盖住，遮住`) SARS, *probably increasing* its toll(n.)(`=the amount of damage or the number of deaths and injuries that are caused in a particular war, disaster, etc. （战争、灾难等造成的）毁坏；伤亡人数`).

This time, they *have been* quicker *to take* preventive(a.)(`=intended to try to stop sth that causes problems or difficulties from happening 预防性的；防备的`) measures and *give information*.

====
- echo : n. *the fact of an idea, event, etc. being like another and reminding you of it; sth that reminds you of sth else* 映现；暗示；启示；反响 +
-> Yesterday's crash *has(v.) grim echoes(n.) of* previous disasters. 昨天的撞车事故和以前的灾难令人痛心地相似。

- respiratory => respire +‎ -atory.  re-再 + -spir-呼吸 + -e
- lethal => 来自拉丁语letum,死亡，词源不详。可能同Lethe,冥河，地狱，引申词义死去的，致命的。
- toll => 来自古英语 toll,费用，税费，关税，来自 Proto-Germanic tullo,计算数，告知，来自 PIE dol, 计算，思考，*词源同 tell, tall.* 引申诸相关词义。

这与SARS有相似之处，SARS是一种呼吸道疾病，也是由一种冠状病毒引起的，武汉病毒属于冠状病毒家族。2002年至2003年期间，中国和其他国家有8000多人感染了非典。其中近10%的人死亡。迄今公布的数据表明，这种新病毒的致死率可能较低。官员们试图掩盖非典，可能增加了它的死亡人数。这一次，他们更加迅速地采取了预防措施, 并公开了信息。

Officials in Wuhan *initially downplayed*(`=downplay : to make people think that sth is less important than it really is 对…轻描淡写；使轻视；贬低`) the new virus, but *that changed* [just before the government *said that* health workers *had been infected*].

On the day of that announcement, Mr Xi *said* {officials *should “put* people’s lives and health [*first*]”}, a crucial signal (that he *would tolerate no* cover-ups(n.)(`=cover-up : action that is taken to hide a mistake or illegal activity from the public 掩盖；掩饰`)).

The government *started providing* daily updates. It *has appointed* 任命；委任 Zhong Nanshan, a doctor (*renowned*(v.) 使有声望 for *disputing*(`=dispute : to question whether sth is true and valid 对…提出质询；对…表示异议（或怀疑）`) the official line during the SARS crisis), *to lead* an advisory(a.)顾问的；咨询的 team.

- renown => *前缀re-指“重新，反复”*，如repeat（重复）；*词根nown指“名字”，和单词name（名称）同源*，这里涉及到n、m音变，如：limit（界限）—lintel（门楣），napkin（餐巾）—map（地图），haunt（常去之地）—home（家）。
- dispute => dis-, 分开，散开。-put, 思考，词源同compute, putative. 即不同的思考，引申词义争论。

武汉的官员, 起初对这种新病毒轻描淡写，但在政府电视台报道医务工作者被感染之前，情况发生了变化。在发表声明的当天，习近平表示，官员们应该“把人民的生命和健康放在首位”，这是一个关键信号，表明他不会容忍任何隐瞒。政府开始提供每日更新。它已任命钟南山领导一个顾问团队。钟南山是一名医生，在非典危机期间, 他因质疑官方路线而闻名。

Now that 既然, 由于 China *has switched to* crisis mode, few *doubt* the government’s resolve 决心；决定.

But there *are* still plenty of reasons *to worry*, both *about* the impact on people’s health *[as well as]* *on* firms and investors.

*Just as* SARS *suggests* how a coronavirus *might spread*, it also *has* lessons for how such a pathogen(`=a thing that causes disease 病原体`) *might affect* an economy.

[In May 2003] passenger traffic(`=the movement of people or goods from one place to another 运输；人流；货流`) numbers in China *plunged*(`=to decrease suddenly and quickly 暴跌；骤降；突降;/（尤指用力地）投入，跳进`) more than 40% from a year earlier.

Shops, restaurants and hotels *all suffered*.

In annualised 年度的;按年计算 terms(`=*in the long/short/medium term* : used to describe what will happen a long, short, etc. time in the future 长╱短╱中期内`), quarter-on-quarter 与去年同季度相比的 growth at the peak of SARS *fell to* 3.5%, *down* [from more than 12%], *according to* Wang Tao of UBS, a Swiss bank.

现在, 中国已经进入了危机模式，几乎没有人怀疑政府的决心。但仍有很多理由值得担忧，无论是对人们健康的影响，还是对公司和投资者的影响。正如SARS揭示了冠状病毒如何传播一样，它也提供了如何影响经济的教训。2003年5月，中国的客运量较上年同期下降了40%以上。商店、餐馆和酒店都受到了影响。据瑞士联合银行(UBS)的王涛(音)称，按年率计算，非典高峰时期的季度环比增长率, 从12%以上降到了3.5%。

*In the case of* the Wuhan virus, there *are* some grounds(`=*~ for sth/for doing sth* : a good or true reason for saying, doing or believing sth 充分的理由；根据`) for optimism 乐观；乐观主义.

Most hopefully, the government’s faster response *could mean that* it *takes* less time *to contain*(`=to prevent sth harmful from spreading or getting worse 防止…蔓延（或恶化）;/控制，克制，抑制（感情）`) it.

If experts *conclude that* the virus *is not as dangerous as* the one that *caused* SARS, China *might also be able to relax* its controls on travel to and from Wuhan [before big economic damage *is done*].

`主` Efforts *to ensure* transparency `谓` *could reduce* panic.

就武汉病毒而言，我们有理由感到乐观。最有希望的是，政府更快的响应速度, 意味着它可以用更少的时间来控制它。如果专家们得出结论，认为这种病毒不像SARS病毒那么危险，那么在封城等管制措施, 造成重大经济损失之前，中国或许就能放松对进出武汉的交通管制。努力确保透明度, 可以减少恐慌。

However, Chinese people *are* far more mobile *than* they were in the early 2000s. About 450,000 of them *travel daily by train* in Hubei, the province (of which Wuhan *is* the capital). That *is* more than double the daily passenger volume in Guangdong in 2002 when that province *became* a hotspot 热点；热区 of SARS.

====
- the province (*of which* Wuhan is *the capital*).  +
 -> 这里的 of, 其实是和后面的 capital 相连的, 即: *the capital of which*(指 the province Hubei) *is Wuhan*.
====

*Helped by* a vast(`=extremely large in area, size, amount, etc. 辽阔的；巨大的；庞大的；大量的`) bullet-train 高速列车；动车 network (*built* over the past decade), passengers from Wuhan *will have gone farther and faster* than those in Guangdong (back then) 当时, 那时候.

China *is also far more connected to* the rest of the world. [In 2018] some 205,000 people *took flights into and out of China* each day, six times *as many as* on the eve （尤指宗教节假日的）前夜，前夕 of SARS.

然而，与本世纪初相比，中国人的流动性要大得多。其中约45万人, 每天乘坐火车前往湖北省，而湖北省的省会是武汉。这数量, 比2002年广东省成为非典热点时, 每日客运量的两倍还多。得益于过去10年建成的庞大子弹头列车(动车)网络，来自武汉的乘客, 将比当时广东的乘客行得更远、更快。中国与世界的联系也更加紧密。2018年，每天约有20.5万人乘飞机进出中国，是“非典”前夕的6倍。

The timing(n.)(`=the act of choosing when sth happens; a particular point or period of time when sth happens or is planned 定时；时间的选择；（事情发生或计划安排的）特定时间`) of the new outbreak *compounds*(`=to make sth bad become even worse by causing further damage or problems 使加重；使恶化`) the difficulty of *containing* the virus.

It *has come* [just *ahead of* the spring festival, a public holiday which this year *runs* from January 24th to 30th]. In recent days millions *have travelled* across the country *to celebrate 庆祝；庆贺 with* relatives.

At transport hubs, travellers’ temperatures *are being checked* to detect(v.) fever. But it *may take* a week or more *for* the virus *to incubate* 孵（卵）；孵化(`=*be incubating sth* : (medical 医) to have an infectious disease developing inside you before symptoms (= signs of illness) appear 有（传染病在体内）潜伏`), so some infected people *may not be spotted*(`=to see or notice a person or thing, especially suddenly or when it is not easy to do so 看见；看出；注意到；发现`).

====
- timing : n. *the act of choosing when sth happens; a particular point or period of time when sth happens or is planned* 定时；时间的选择；（事情发生或计划安排的）特定时间 +
-> *The timing of the decision* was a complete surprise. 选择那个时间作决定，完全出人意料。 +
-> Please check your *flight timings* carefully. 请仔细核对航班时间。

- compound => com-, 强调。-pon, 放置，词源同opponent, position. 即放在一起的。

新疫情爆发的时机, 增加了控制病毒的难度。它刚好赶在春节之前到来，春节是中国的公共假期，今年的春节时段, 从1月24日持续到30日。最近几天，数百万人会前往全国各地, 与亲人一起庆祝。在交通枢纽地点处，旅客的体温会被检测, 以确定他们是否发烧。但病毒的潜伏期, 可能需要一周或更长的时间, 病毒才会暴露出症状，所以一些被感染者, 可能不会被检测出来。

The economy *is* bigger but less fizzy(a.)(`=having bubbles of gas in it 起泡沫的；嘶嘶作响的`) *than* it was in 2003.

[During the SARS outbreak] a few big sectors *thrived* [even as others struggled 艰难地行进；吃力地进行]. Exports *surged* 35%. Spending on infrastructure and housing *held*(`=to keep sth at the same level, rate, speed, etc. 使保持同样程度（或比率、速度等）`) strong.

Today, however, export growth *is* far weaker -- only 0.5% in 2019. Property sales *have started falling* after a long boom.

And the country *has* less scope(`=the range of things that a subject, an organization, an activity, etc. deals with （题目、组织、活动等的）范围; /*~ (for sth) /~ (for sb) (to do sth)* :  the opportunity or ability to do or achieve sth （做或实现某事的）机会，能力`) *to increase* its spending on infrastructure, *having already built* so much over the past decade.

In the first few days [after the number of confirmed infections *surged* [this month]], Chinese stocks *fell* about 5%. They *could tumble*(`=to fall rapidly in value or amount （价格或数量）暴跌，骤降;/to fall downwards, often hitting the ground several times, but usually without serious injury; to make sb/sth fall in this way （使）跌倒，摔倒，滚落，翻滚下来`) *further*.

During SARS, Hong Kong’s main index （物价和工资等的）指数 *declined* by nearly 20%.

====
- tumble => 来自古英语 tumbian, 跳舞，跳跃，翻滚，来自 Proto-Germanic *tumona, 旋转，转动*，词源同 tumbler,tumbrel.-le,表反复。引申诸相关词义。
====
与2003年相比，经济规模更大，但泡沫更少。在SARS爆发期间，即使在其他行业举步维艰时, 一些大的行业也在蓬勃发展。那时的出口激增了35%。基础设施和住房支出保持强劲。然而，今天的出口增长要弱得多——2019年仅为0.5%。房地产销售在经过了长期繁荣后, 开始下降。在过去的十年里，中国已经在基础设施上进行了大量的建设，因此增加基础设施支出的空间, 也越来越小。 +
本月确诊感染人数激增后的头几天，中国股市下跌了约5%。它们可能进一步下跌。非典期间，香港主要股指下跌了近20%。

`主` The part of the economy *most hurt by* SARS `系` *was* the services sector, which then *accounted for* about 40% of GDP.

Today the share *is* higher than 50%. But consumer spending(n.)（政府或其他机构的）开支，支出，花销 *could be* more resilient(`=able to feel better quickly after sth unpleasant such as shock, injury, etc. 可迅速恢复的；有适应力的;/有弹性（或弹力）的；能复原的`) this time *because of* huge growth in the popularity 受欢迎；普及；流行 of online shopping.

[If they *are* fearful(a.)(`=*~ (for sb) /~ (of sth/of doing sth) /~ (that)...* : ( formal ) nervous and afraid 担心；担忧；忧虑`) of *venturing*(`=venture 敢于去（危险或令人不快的地方）`) *out* (Wuhan *has ordered*(`=to use your position of authority to tell sb to do sth or say that sth must happen 命令；指挥；要求`) residents *to wear masks* in shops and other establishments(`=an organization, a large institution or a hotel 机构；大型组织；企业；旅馆`) where people *congregate*(`=to come together in a group 群集；聚集；集合`))], people *can continue* to buy goods at home.

受非典影响最严重的经济领域是服务业，当时该行业约占GDP的40%。如今这一比例已超过50%。但这一次，由于网上购物的普及程度大幅提高，消费者支出可能会更有弹性。如果他们害怕出门(武汉已经要求居民在商店和其他人们聚集的场所戴口罩)，人们可以继续在家里买东西。

China *can also draw*(`=*~ sth (from sb)* : to produce a reaction or response 产生，引起，激起（反应或回应）`) comfort *from* the speed (with which its economy *recovered* after SARS *was conquered*).

[By the second half of 2003] it *was back to* double-digit growth. Consumers *indulged*(`=to satisfy a particular desire, interest, etc. 满足（欲望、兴趣等）;/*~ sb (with sth) /~ sth* : to be too generous in allowing sb to have or do whatever they like 放纵；听任`) their pent-up(a.)(`=(of feelings, energy, etc. 感情、精力等) that cannot be expressed or released 压抑的；积压的`) demand(n.) for everything from cars to beer.

But *as* the current crisis *grows*, the grim reality of the present *is all that* `主` many people -- especially the millions *confined*(`=*~ sb/sth to sth* : [ often passive ] to keep sb/sth inside the limits of a particular activity, subject, area, etc. 限制；限定`) *to* Wuhan -- `系` *are likely* to be contemplating(v.)(`=contemplate : to think about whether you should do sth, or how you should do sth 考虑；思量；思忖`).

中国还可以从非典后经济复苏的速度中, 得到安慰。到2003年下半年，它又回到了两位数的增长。从汽车到啤酒，消费者对一切东西都有了被压抑的需求。但随着当前危机的加剧，当前严峻的现实, 很可能是许多人——尤其是数百万被限制在武汉的人——所要考虑的。

HOW BIG *should* a business team *be*? It *is* an enormously(`=very; very much 非常；极其`) important issue for companies.

Teams that are too small *may lack* the skills *required* to get the job done; teams that are too big *may be* impossible to co-ordinate.

一个商业团队应该有多大?这对公司来说是一个极其重要的问题。规模太小的团队, 可能缺乏完成工作所需的技能; 团队太大, 则可能无法协调。

Similar trade-offs(n.)(`=trade-off : *~ (between sth and sth)* : the act of balancing two things that you need or want but which are opposed to each other （在需要而又相互对立的两者间的）权衡，协调`) *may apply*(`=*~ (to sb/sth)* : ( not used in the progressive tenses 不用于进行时 ) to concern or relate to sb/sth 有关；涉及`) when it *comes to* firms [as a whole].

Startups *are* often short of staff.

The founders *must play* a host of(`=*host of sb/sth* : a large number of people or things 许多；大量`) different roles, *from* obtaining finance *to* product development and marketing, for which they *may not be* equally suited.

But the upside(`=the more positive aspect of a situation that is generally bad （糟糕局面的）好的一面，光明的一面，正面`) *is that* they *can have* highly collaborative(a.)(`=involving, or done by, several people or groups of people working together 合作的；协作的；协力的`) working environments.

类似的权衡也适用于整个公司。初创公司往往人手不足。创始人必须扮演许多不同的角色，从获得资金, 到产品开发和营销，他们可能并不同样适合这些角色。但好处是他们可以有高度协作的工作环境。

`主` People who *have worked for* startups `谓` *say* the culture *changes* when the company *reaches* a certain size.

Patty McCord, formerly(ad.)(`=in earlier times 以前；从前`)  of Netflix, *referred to* the “stand-on-a-chair number” -- the biggest group that *can easily hear* the boss *address* them.

曾在初创公司工作过的人说，当公司达到一定规模时，企业文化就会改变。曾在Netflix工作的帕蒂•麦考德(Patty McCord), 提到了“站在椅子上的人的数目”——这个群体, 能容易地听到老板对他们讲的话。

Robin Dunbar, an anthropologist 人类学家 at Oxford University, *has done* a lot of work on primate 灵长类；灵长目动物 groups.

His argument(`=a reason or set of reasons that sb uses to show that sth is true or correct 论据；理由；论点`) *is that* the size of the group *is linked to* the size of the brain. With their large brains, humans *can cope with* larger bands(`=band : a group of people who do sth together or who have the same ideas 一伙人；一帮人`). A larger social group *has* many advantages, *allowing* for greater protection and specialisation(`=专业化分工（等于specialization）`).

牛津大学人类学家罗宾·邓巴(Robin Dunbar), 对灵长类动物群体做了大量研究。他的论点是，群体的大小与大脑的大小有关。人类拥有巨大的大脑，可以应付更大人群数量的事情。一个更大的社会群体会拥有很多优势，比如允许更大范围的自我保护, 和有利于专业化分工。

Whereas （用以比较或对比两个事实）然而，但是，尽管 150 *is sometimes referred to as* the “Dunbar number”, the academic himself in fact *refers to* a range of figures.

He *observes that* humans *tend to have* five intimate(`=having a close and friendly relationship 亲密的；密切的`) friends, 15 or so 大约，左右 good friends, around 50 social friends and 150-odd(`=(无比较级或最高级；通常紧接在数字后面) approximately or a little more than the number mentioned 大约；略多`) acquaintances.

====
- odd : ( no comparative or superlative; usually placed immediately after a number 无比较级或最高级；通常紧接在数字后面 ) *approximately or a little more than the number mentioned* 大约；略多 +
-> How old is she -- *seventy odd*? 她多大年纪？七十出头？ +
-> He's worked there *for twenty-odd years*. 他在那里工作了二十多年。
====

150有时被称为“邓巴数”，而学者自己实际上指的是一系列数字。他发现，人类往往有5个亲密的朋友，15个左右的好朋友，大约50个社会朋友和150多个熟人。

*Running* a larger network *can be* difficult. *[So]* much time *is needed* to maintain(v.) relationships *[that]* their quality *inevitably*(`=as is certain to happen 不可避免地；必然地`) *suffers*.

The armed forces *have spent* millennia 千年期；千周年纪念日（millennium 的复数） *experimenting 做试验；进行实验 with* unit size.

A Roman centurion 百夫长（古罗马军队中管理100名士兵的军官） *oversaw*(`=oversee : to watch sb/sth and make sure that a job or an activity is done correctly 监督；监视`) 100. The modern American army company *has* 180 members. Britain’s equivalent(a./n.)(`=*~ (to sth)* : equal in value, amount, meaning, importance, etc. （价值、数量、意义、重要性等）相等的，相同的`) numbers 120.

运行更大的网络可能很困难。维持一段关系需要太多的时间，因此他们的质量必然会受到影响。数千年来，军队一直在试验单位规模。一个罗马百夫长监管着100个。现代美国陆军公司有180名成员。英国相当于120个。

These *are* rough(`=not exact; not including all details 不确切的；粗略的；大致的`) estimates, *rather than* 而不是 rigid 死板的；僵硬的 figures.

But *it* is striking(`=interesting and unusual enough to attract attention 引人注目的；异乎寻常的；显著的`) *that* many group activities *seem to be close to* a Dunbar number.

The Special Air Service, Britain’s elite fighting unit, *has* four-man patrols(`=patrol : a group of soldiers, vehicles, etc. that patrol an area 巡逻队；巡逻车队`); when your life *depends on* it, you *need to have* absolute trust in your colleagues. As a result, such groups *are limited* in size.

这些是粗略的估计，而不是僵化的数字。但令人吃惊的是，许多团体活动似乎接近邓巴数字。英国精锐战斗部队特种空勤局(Special Air Service)只有四名巡逻人员; 当你的生命完全取决于它时，你需要绝对信任你的同事。因此，这些团体的规模有限。

Sports-team sizes *relate to* the playing area. There *are* five players in a basketball side /and six in ice hockey  曲棍球; outdoors there *are* 11 players in football and cricket 板球 teams, and 7-15 in the various forms of rugby 橄榄球运动.

Perhaps this *is* the optimal size for coaching(n.)(`=the process of training sb to play a sport, to do a job better or to improve a skill （体育运动、工作或技能的）训练，培训，指导`) purposes, or perhaps crowds 人群；观众 *would struggle to distinguish* individual players if teams *were* larger.

====
- hockey => 词源不详，可能来自hook,钩子，因这种球钩状的球杆而得名。
- rugby => 原为英国中部 Warwickshire 地名 Rugby,因该运动发源于 Rugby school 而得名。字面意思可 能为某个昵称 Rug 的人的城镇，比较 derby.

- coaching : n. *the process of training sb to play a sport, to do a job better or to improve a skill* （体育运动、工作或技能的）训练，培训，指导 +
-> *a coaching session* 集训期
====
运动队的大小与比赛场地有关。一支篮球队有5名队员，冰球有6名队员;在户外，有11名球员参加足球和板球队，7-15人参加各种形式的橄榄球。也许这是教练的最佳规模，或者如果球队规模更大，观众可能很难区分单个球员。

Small work teams *may also tend towards* these two size ranges. “If you *want* a committee *to decide* something, *limit* it *to* four to five people,” *says* Mr Dunbar. “But *to brainstorm* 集体讨论；集思广益以寻找;头脑风暴 in a meeting, you *need* 12-15.”

Many companies *use* “agile”(a.)(`=able to move quickly and easily （动作）敏捷的，灵活的;/（思维）机敏的，机灵的`) teams which *draw* employees *from* across the company; they *tend to have* between five and nine members.

小的工作团队也可能趋向于这两个大小范围。邓巴表示:“如果你想让一个委员会做出决定，就把人数限制在4至5人以内。”但要在会议上进行头脑风暴，你需要12-15个小时。许多公司使用“敏捷”团队(通常是由跨职能的人员组成的)，从整个公司吸引员工;他们通常有5到9个成员。

Most businesses *are* small. A survey of British firms in 2015 *found that* `主` only 0.6% `谓` *employed* more than 150 people.

Nor (用于肯定动词前，表示同意刚提及的否定命题)也不 *are* small companies necessarily ephemeral(a.)(`=lasting or used for only a short period of time 短暂的；瞬息的`). One study *concluded that* `主` 89% of organisations that *last* more than 100 years `谓` *employ* fewer than 300 people.

====
- ephemeral => epi-, 在上，在中。-hemer, 天，词源同 euhemerism。原指一种朝生暮死的昆虫，后形容短暂的生命，转瞬即逝的。
====

大多数企业规模都很小。2015年对英国公司的一项调查发现，只有0.6%的公司雇佣了150人以上。小公司也不一定是昙花一现。一项研究得出的结论是，在100年以上的企业中，89%雇佣的员工不到300人。

Another group of long-lasting organisations *is* religious congregations （教堂的）会众. The Hutterites 哈特教派信徒, a Protestant 新教教徒（16世纪脱离罗马天主教） group with German origins 出身; 血统, *limited* their communities *to* 150.

They *believed that* it was possible to maintain(v.) solidarity in a group of fewer than 150 people [with peer pressure]; once you *exceeded* that number, you *needed* the equivalent(n.)(`=~ (of/to sth) a thing, amount, word, etc. that is equivalent to sth else 相等的东西；等量；对应词`) of a police force.

另一组长期存在的组织是宗教集会。哈特教派信徒是一个德国裔的新教团体，他们把自己的社区限制在150个以内。他们认为，在不到150人的群体中，有同辈压力是可以保持团结的;一旦超过这个数字，你就需要相当于警察的力量。

For much of economic history, work *was conducted*(`=to organize and/or do a particular activity 组织；安排；实施；执行`) in small units by peasants 农民, tenant 房客；租户；佃户 farmers 佃农；土地租用人 and artisans 工匠；手艺人 (for example blacksmiths 铁匠).

The advent of powered(`=operated by a form of energy such as electricity or by the type of energy mentioned 由…驱动的；电动的`) machinery （统称）机器；（尤指）大型机器 *enabled* production at a much larger scale, with workers *crowded into* factories.

[These days] the rise of the service economy *means that* workers *are no longer concentrated in* such large groups.

在经济史的大部分时间里，工作都是由农民、佃农和工匠(例如铁匠)在小单位里完成的。由电能驱动的机械的出现, 使大规模生产成为可能，工人们涌进工厂。如今，服务经济的崛起, 意味着工人不再集中在如此庞大的群体中。

This *may not be* a bad thing. *It* was easy for employees in large factories *to regard* remote company owners *as* “them” *rather than* “us”, and indeed(ad.)的确（强调肯定的陈述或答复） *it* was easy for business owners *to perceive*(`=*~ sb/sth (as sth)* : to understand or think of sb/sth in a particular way 将…理解为；将…视为；认为`) workers *as* an undifferentiated(a.)(`=having parts that you cannot distinguish between; not split into different parts or sections 无法区分的；分不开的；一体的`) mass of people and *treat* them *accordingly*. Strikes *were* common.

====
- perceive => 来自拉丁语percipere,得到，抓住，来自per-,完全的，-cip,抓住，理解，词源同conceive,percipient.引申词义感觉，感知。
====

这可能不是一件坏事。大型工厂的员工很容易把遥远的公司老板视为“他们”，而不是“我们”，企业老板也很容易把工人视为一群一视同仁的人，并据此对待他们。罢工是常见的。

The modern company *may settle*(`=to put an end to an argument or a disagreement 结束（争论、争端等）；解决（分歧、纠纷等）`) on a model with a small group of “core” workers and a larger group of contract 合同；合约；契约 workers.

The result *may be* more cohesion(n.)(`=the act or state of keeping together 黏合；结合；凝聚性;/ 内聚力`) within the core staff /but the non-core staff *may be less well treated*.

The small core teams *may work effectively*. The big question *will be* the effect on morale(n.)(`=the amount of confidence and enthusiasm, etc. that a person or a group has at a particular time 士气`) of those outside those teams.

现代公司可能会选择一种模式，即一小群“核心”工人和一群更大的合同工。其结果可能是核心员工内部的凝聚力增强，但非核心员工的待遇可能不那么好。小的核心团队可以有效地工作。最大的问题是, 这些团队之外的人的士气会受到怎样的影响。

*Finding* the optimal size of teams and organisations

Jan 23rd 2020 |


HOW BIG *should* a business team *be*? It *is* an enormously important issue for companies. Teams that are too small *may lack* the skills *required* to get the job done; teams that are too big *may be* impossible to co-ordinate.

Similar trade-offs *may apply* [when it *comes to* firms (as a whole)]. Startups *are* often short(a.) of staff. The founders *must play* a host of different roles, *from* obtaining finance *to* product development and marketing, for which they *may not be* equally suited. But the upside *is that* they *can have* highly collaborative working environments.

`主` People who *have worked for* startups `谓` *say* {the culture *changes* when the company *reaches* a certain size}. Patty McCord, formerly of Netflix, *referred to* the “stand-on-a-chair number” -- the biggest group that *can easily hear* the boss *address* them.

Robin Dunbar, an anthropologist at Oxford University, *has done a lot of work on* primate groups. His argument *is that* the size of the group *is linked to* the size of the brain. With their large brains, humans *can cope with* larger bands. A larger social group *has* many advantages, *allowing for* greater protection and specialisation.

Whereas 150 *is sometimes referred to as* the “Dunbar number”, the academic himself in fact *refers to* a range of figures. He *observes that* humans *tend to have* five intimate friends, 15 [or so] good friends, around 50 social friends /and 150-odd acquaintances.

`主` *Running* a larger network `系` *can be difficult*. *[So]* much time *is needed* to maintain relationships *[that]* `主` their quality `谓` *inevitably suffers*. The armed forces *have spent* millennia *experimenting with* unit size. A Roman centurion *oversaw* 100. The modern American army company *has* 180 members. Britain’s equivalent numbers 120.

These *are* rough estimates, *rather than* rigid figures. But *it* is striking *that* many group activities *seem to be close to* a Dunbar number. The Special Air Service, Britain’s elite fighting unit, *has* four-man patrols; when your life *depends on* it, you *need to have absolute trust in* your colleagues.

Strikes *were* common.

The modern company *may settle* on a model with a small group of “core” workers and a larger group of contract workers. The result *may be* more cohesion within the core staff /but the non-core staff *may be less well treated*. The small core teams *may work effectively*. The big question *will be* the effect on morale(n.) of those outside those teams.
