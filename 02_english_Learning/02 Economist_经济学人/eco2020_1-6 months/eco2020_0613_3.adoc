- 这一大杂烩也反映了抗议活动具有的"扩散性"和"基本上是自发的"的性质。少数人，尤其是在弗洛伊德死后的早期，目睹了暴力，这些暴力先是由抗议者引起，然后是由越来越多的警察带来(尽管尚不清楚这些暴力活动, 是否由司法部长威廉·巴尔(William Barr)所指出的神秘的无政府左翼分子, 所造成的)。然而，绝大多数的多种族集会都是和平的。许多是由小镇上的朋友和邻居组织起来的。据一项统计，已有1280个地方发生了抗议活动，其中包括左翼激进分子的温床地点，如威斯康辛州的姊妹湾, 和怀俄明州的谢里登。

In big cities such as Washington, DC, black activist groups *have played a significant organising role*.

- 在特朗普任期内，中左翼激进主义的更广泛发展可能也起到了一定作用。这在很大程度上源于妇女游行，在总统就职后不久，吸引了数百万人走上街头抗议歧视女性。事实上，抗议活动催生的许多草根团体中, 一些团体最近参与了组织示威活动。在宾夕法尼亚州，一个名为“宾夕法尼亚站起来”的组织遍布全州，他们致力于对"投票权、移民改革、种族公正和其他中左翼议题"展开运动，帮助提高兰开斯特和费城的投票率, 并召集人群。

== No justice, no peace

America’s protests turn jubilant

Democrats are not organising them, but they do stand to gain

Jun 11th 2020 | WASHINGTON, DC


A WEEK AFTER the Trump administration ordered riot police to charge a peaceful crowd in Lafayette Square, it was transformed. The leafy park in front of the White House was enclosed by a steel fence, through which police could be seen loitering. The streets alongside it—including newly named “Black Lives Matter Plaza”, at the bottom of 16th Street, in direct view of the White House—had been colonised by protesters and were far more fun.

Late into the sultry evening, the chanting throng that had filled the plaza for much of the day—and most days since George Floyd’s murder—was winding down. Black musicians and street artists performed for a thinning crowd. A young woman had set up a stall offering free deodorants, tampons and fruit: “Take what you need—just know you are loved,” she carolled. Well-wishers ambled along the fence-line, perusing the banners, drawings and personal messages plastering it.

They offer a cultural history of America’s recent decades of racial injustice, including prayers for many of its victims. “I’m still crying for Emmett Till”, read one note decorated with hearts, beside a sketch of the 14-year-old child lynched in 1955. They also included more overtly political messages, such as “Who do you call when the police murders?” and, in reference to the White House’s well-guarded chief resident, “Bunker bitch”.

This potpourri also reflects the diffuse and largely spontaneous nature of the protests. A minority, especially in the early days after Mr Floyd’s death, have seen violence, first by protesters, then increasingly also by the police (though it is not clear that any of this was caused by the shadowy anarcho-leftists William Barr, the attorney general, has pointed to). The vast majority of the multiracial gatherings have been peaceful, however. Many have been organised by groups of friends and neighbours in small towns. By one count there have been protests in 1,280 places—including such hotbeds of left-wing militancy as Sister Bay, Wisconsin, and Sheridan, Wyoming.



In big cities such as Washington, DC, black activist groups have played a significant organising role. Many are members of a national coalition, the Movement for Black Lives, which was formed in 2014 and has 150 constituent parts. Its best-known, Black Lives Matter (BLM), which came to prominence over police killings during Barack Obama’s second term, has been especially influential, in part by rallying left-leaning whites, whose mass participation in these protests is their most novel feature. “The political weather has shifted,” says Makia Green of Black Lives Matter DC, “We now have widespread multiracial, multi-generation support.”

A broader growth of centre-left activism during Mr Trump’s tenure has probably also played a role. Much of it is rooted in the Women’s March that drew millions onto the streets shortly after the president’s inauguration to protest against misogyny. Indeed, some of the many grassroots groups spawned by that protest have been involved in organising demonstrations in recent days. One such in Pennsylvania, a state-wide organisation called Pennsylvania Stands Up, which campaigns on voting rights, immigration reform, racial justice and other centre-left issues, helped boost turnout and marshal crowds in Lancaster and Philadelphia.

Where is this headed? Perhaps not to the radical reforms many of the protesters demand. The current Congress has passed little except coronavirus stimuli. It is not about to start defunding the police. Yet academic research into the long-term political effects of the Women’s March and Tea Party movement of 2009 suggests such protests do not merely reflect public opinion. They also increase voter turnout. That sounds like more bad news for the president’s overwhelmingly white voting base.

“A lot of people who don’t normally vote say they’re going to vote now,” said Elena, a Hispanic property manager from Fairfax, Virginia, who had spent a long hot day at the plaza, “to be part of history” with her daughter and black boyfriend. “People can argue about whichever party is better for this or that,” she said. “But on this issue, it’s completely clear.”

- 四个月前，唐纳德•特朗普(Donald Trump)赢得第二任期的几率看起来从未如此之高。在弹劾审判中被轻松宣判无罪后，他的支持率达到了三年来的最高水平，接近40以上的区间，正是这一区间让乔治•w•布什(George W. Bush)和巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)得以连任。失业率达到了50年来的最低水平，这使得他将经济的强劲表现归功于自己。自称社会主义者的伯尼•桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)在前三场民主党初选中都赢得了普选。

- 4月8日，美国佛蒙特州独立参议员伯尼·桑德斯向其竞选团队成员宣布，退出美国总统大选. 在今年美国大选民主党初选中，桑德斯初期表现良好，纷纷拿下新罕布什尔州、内华达州等初选，但随后在“超级星期二”多州初选接连失利于前副总统拜登，随后，多名候选人在退选之后也转为支持拜登，让桑德斯感到大势已去。 +
伯尼·桑德斯宣布退出民主党总统初选，这意味着意味着前副总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）提前4个月获得民主党党内提名，将在11月大选中作为民主党候选人, 挑战现任共和党总统特朗普。

*on/to the verge of sth/of doing sth* : very near to the moment when sb does sth or sth happens 濒于；接近于；行将 +
=> 经由古法语verge来源于拉丁语virga(杆);“边缘”的意义来自于(英国)皇家总管大臣的土地裁判权,“权杖”是此权利的象征。作“接近,濒临”时,来源于拉丁语动词vergere(弯曲,倾斜)。 同源词：verger, virgule; converge, diverge +
-> He was *on the verge of tears*. 他差点儿哭了出来。 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/v/verge.jpg[100,100]

image:../../+ img_单词图片/c/chasm.jpg[100,100]

- 但即使以特朗普的狂热标准来衡量，他的政治地位自那以后的暴跌也显得异常突然。首先，巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)的温和派副总统乔•拜登(Joe Biden)成功东山再起，从退选的边缘一跃成为假定候选人。然后，covid-19重创了美国，夺走了至少11万人的生命和3000万个工作岗位。就在病毒死亡人数开始减少的时候，乔治·弗洛伊德的死亡引发的抗议活动震惊了美国的各个城市。特朗普冷酷无情的回应扩大了他与拜登之间的共鸣鸿沟。

There is little question that 毫无疑问 if the election *were held* today, Mr Biden *would win* [in a near-landslide （山坡或悬崖的）崩塌，塌方，滑坡，地滑].

- trail : /treɪl/ v. to pull sth behind sb/sth, usually along the ground; to be pulled along in this way （被）拖，拉  +
/ *~ (by/in sth)* ( used especially in the progressive tenses 尤用于进行时 ) to be losing a game or other contest （在比赛或其他竞赛中）落后，失利，失败 +
-> The bride's dress *trailed behind her*. 新娘的结婚礼服拖在身后。 +
-> *We were trailing by five points*. 我们落后五分。

- 即使是在2月份总统的高点，他在全国民调中的平均支持率, 也落后于拜登5个百分点。现在赤字已经膨胀到8个。摇摆州的民调, 显示出类似的情况。拜登不仅在特朗普首次当选的中西部战场领先，而且在佛罗里达州和亚利桑那州也领先。即使是特朗普在2016年轻松获胜的州，比如乔治亚州、德克萨斯州、爱荷华州和俄亥俄州，看上去也颇具竞争力。毫无疑问，如果今天举行选举，拜登将以近乎压倒性的优势获胜。


The election, of course, *will not be held* today. In fact, `主` more time *remains* between now and November 3rd than `谓` *has passed* since Mr Trump’s impeachment trial. And *given* the devotion 奉献；忠诚；专心；热心;宗教敬拜 of the president’s base, Mr Biden *is probably approaching* his electoral ceiling 天花板；上限, whereas Mr Trump *has* plenty of room *to win back* soft 有同情心的；仁厚的；心肠软的;愚蠢的；没头脑的；脑子发昏的 supporters.

- devotion : great love, care and support for sb/sth 挚爱；关爱；关照 / the action of spending a lot of time or energy on sth 奉献；忠诚；专心；热心 +
-> her devotion to duty 她对职责的忠诚

- 当然，选举不会在今天举行。事实上，从现在到11月3日的时间长度, 比弹劾特朗普的审判时间还要长。鉴于总统支持者的忠诚，拜登很可能已经接近他的选举上限，而特朗普有足够的空间赢回摇摆中的支持者。

*Burning down* the House

Indeed, there are good reasons *to expect* he *will*. First, the latest jobs report *suggests that* the economy *may have bottomed out* (价格、恶劣局势等)降到最低点；停止恶化. In 1984 Ronald Reagan *trounced* 彻底打败；击溃 Walter Mondale by *declaring* “Morning in America”, though unemployment *remained high* by historical standards. Mr Trump *plans* to make(v.) the same argument. The Black Lives Matter protests *could also backfire 产生事与愿违的不良（或危险）后果 on* Democrats if they *rally* white voters *behind* the “law and order” candidate, as they *are thought* to have done in 1968.

- trounce : /traʊns/ [ VN ] ( formal ) to defeat sb completely 彻底打败；击溃 +
=> 词源不详，可能来自拉丁语 truncare,砍，切，词源同 truncate,trench.引申词义打败，击溃等。

- 事实上，我们有充分的理由期待他会这样做。首先，最新的就业报告表明, 经济可能已经触底。1984年，罗纳德•里根(Ronald Reagan)以“美国的早晨已经来到”的口号, 痛击了沃尔特•蒙代尔(Walter Mondale)，尽管以历史标准衡量，失业率仍处于高位。特朗普打算发表同样的观点。“黑人生命也是命”(Black Lives Matter)抗议活动, 也可能对民主党人产生适得其反的效果，如果他们像1968年所做的那样，将白人选民团结在这位“法律和秩序”(特朗普自诩)候选人的背后。


Given all this uncertainty, *it* is tempting 吸引人的；诱人的；有吸引力的 *to conclude that* it is too early for predictions, and *call* the election a virtual 很接近的；几乎…的；事实上的；实际上的；实质上的 toss-up(n.)（两种选择、结果等的）同样可能，均等机会. That is the view of bettors 赌徒；打赌者, who *currently make* Mr Biden a bare 55-45 favourite （取得职位等的）最有希望者. Yet a hard look at the data and at history *suggests that* this is too generous to Mr Trump. The Economist’s first-ever 首次的 statistical forecast of an American presidential race, which we *launch* this week and *will update* every day until the election, *gives* Mr Biden an 82% chance of victory.

- virtual : a. almost or very nearly the thing described, so that any slight difference is not important 很接近的；几乎…的；事实上的；实际上的；实质上的 +
-> The country was sliding into *a state of virtual civil war*. 这个国家实际上正逐渐进入内战状态。

- 考虑到所有这些不确定性，人们很容易得出这样的结论:现在做预测还为时过早，选举实际上是一场胜负难分的比赛。这是下注者的观点，他们目前让拜登以55比45的支持率领先。然而，仔细看看这些数据和历史就会发现，这对特朗普太过慷慨了。“经济学人”对美国总统竞选的首次统计预测显示，拜登获胜的可能性为82%。我们本周发布了这项预测，并将每天更新，直到大选结束。

`主` Mr Trump’s unlikely *triumph*  打败；战胜；成功 in 2016 `谓` *left* many quantitative 数量的；量化的；定量性的 election forecasters *looking silly*. Sam Wang, a professor at Princeton, *vowed* to eat a bug if Mr Trump, whom he said had just a 1% chance of victory in November 2016, *came* even close to winning. (He *chose* a cricket 蟋蟀；蛐蛐.)

- quantitative : a. connected with the amount or number of sth rather than with how good it is 数量的；量化的；定量性的 +
-> *quantitative analysis/research* 定量分析╱研究 +
-> There is no difference between the two *in quantitative terms*. 两者在数量上毫无差别。

- 特朗普在2016年不太可能取得的胜利，让许多用定量分析来预测选举结果的人, 看起来很傻。普林斯顿大学(Princeton)教授山姆•王(Sam Wang)誓言，如果特朗普接近获胜，他就吃虫子。他表示，特朗普在2016年11月的大选中获胜的几率只有1%。(他选了一只蟋蟀。)

However, `主` statistical models that *used* a historically accurate amount of polling error, and *factored  把…因素包括进去 in* the tendency of such errors *to benefit* the same candidate in similar states, `谓` *actually fared(v.)成功（或不成功、更好等） rather well*. Given that Hillary Clinton *led* 处于首位；处于领先地位 polls both nationwide and in a sufficient number of states *to deliver* her the electoral college 总统选举团（在美国由各州选民投票推选组成，集中在一起选举总统和副总统）, no rigorous 谨慎的；细致的；彻底的;严格的；严厉的 forecast on the day of the election *could have anointed* 傅，涂（圣油、圣水） Mr Trump the favourite （取得职位等的）最有希望者. But numerous models *put her chances* at below 85%, and some *were* as low as 70%. (When *applied retroactively(ad.)(决定或行为)有追溯效力的 to* 2016, our own election-day forecast *would have given* Mrs Clinton a 71% shot -- roughly the same probability *it would have assigned to* Mr Obama *beating* Mitt Romney on election day in 2012.) *Just as* `主` solid number-crunching 数字运算;数字捣弄 `谓` *revealed* the brittleness 脆性;脆弱性 of Mrs Clinton’s position, we *hope* it *will shed similar light on* this year’s race.

- number crunching : N-UNCOUNT If you refer to *number crunching*, you mean activities or processes concerned with numbers or mathematical calculation, for example in finance, statistics, or computing. 数字运算 +
-> The computer does most of *the number crunching*.
这台计算机会完成大部分数字运算。

- brittle => 词源同break，破开。-le, 表反复。 助记窍门：brittle→bottle（瓶子）→易碎的

- 然而，统计模型使用了历史上准确的民调误差量，并考虑进此类错误在类似州有利于同一候选人的趋势，这种预测模型, 实际上表现得相当不错。鉴于希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)在全国和足够多个州的民调中领先，足以让她入选选举人团，所以任何严格的预测都不会将特朗普看做是热门人选。但也有很多模型认为她的获胜几率低于85%，有些甚至低至70%。(如果回溯到2016年，我们自己在选举日的预测会给希拉里71%的几率 -- 与2012年奥巴马在选举日击败米特·罗姆尼的概率大致相同)。正如扎实的数字分析揭示了希拉里立场的脆弱性一样，我们希望它能为今年的竞选提供类似的启示。



Like most forecasts, our model, *built* with the aid of two academics from Columbia, Andrew Gelman and Merlin Heidemanns, *applies* past patterns of voters’ behaviour *to* new circumstances. `主` Its stated 陈述；说明；声明 probability of victory `谓` *answers* the question: “How often *have* previous candidates in similar positions *gone on* to win?” If those historical relationships *break down* (机器或车辆)出故障；坏掉;失败, our forecast *will misfire* (计划或笑话)不奏效；不起作用;(发动机)不起动；打不着火;(枪等)不发火；射不出子弹. But one of the paradoxes 矛盾的人（或事物、情况）;似非而是的隽语；悖论；悖论修辞 *presented* by Mr Trump’s unprecedented  前所未有的；空前的；没有先例的 presidency 主席的职位（或任期等）；总统的职位（或任期等） *is that* voters *have mostly treated* him *as* they *would handle* any other Republican.

- *go on* : if a situation goes on , it continues without changing （情况、形势）继续下去，持续 /  (usually be going on) to happen 发生 +
-> This *cannot be allowed to go on*. 决不允许这种情况继续下去。 +
-> *What's going on here*?  这儿出了什么事？

- *go on to do sth* : to do sth after completing sth else （完成某事后）接着做另一事 +
-> The book *goes on to describe* his experiences in the army. 本书继而描述了他在部队的经历。

- 与大多数预测一样，我们的模型是在两位来自哥伦比亚大学的学者安德鲁•格尔曼(Andrew Gelman)和梅林•海德曼斯(Merlin Heidemanns)的帮助下建立的，它将选民过去的行为模式应用于新的情况。它所陈述的获胜概率, 回答了这样一个问题: “先前处于类似地位的候选人, 获胜的几率有多大?” “如果这些历史关系失效，我们的预测就会失败。但特朗普史无前例的总统任期所带来的矛盾状况之一是，选民对待他的方式，基本上与对待其他任何共和党人一样。


Our analysis *begins with* “fundamentals”, or structural factors that *shape* the public’s choices. Predictably 可预言地, when presidents *have* high approval ratings 支持率, their parties’ candidates *tend to get* more votes (see chart 1). Incumbents 在职者；现任者 seeking re-election *also fare better* if the economy *does well*, though growing partisan （对某个人、团体或思想）过分支持的，偏护的，盲目拥护的 polarisation 极化,两极分化 *has shrunk* （使）缩水，收缩，缩小，皱缩 this effect. And voters *seem* to have an “eight-year itch 痒”: only once [since term limits *were enacted* in 1951] *has* the same party *won* three times in a row.

- 我们的分析从“基本面”开始，也就是影响公众选择的结构性因素。可以预见的是，当总统拥有较高的支持率时，其政党的候选人往往会获得更多的选票(见表1)。如果经济状况良好，寻求连任的现任者也会表现得更好，尽管日益增长的党派分化缩小了这种影响。选民们似乎有一种“八年之痒”:自1951年实行任期限制以来，同一政党只有一次连续三次获胜。

Because of the two-term penalty 害处；不利;惩罚；处罚；刑罚, these factors *correctly 正确地；得体地 predicted* Mr Trump’s victory in 2016. Until recently, they *were poised*(a.)处于准备状态；蓄势待发 to favour him again: a typical modern incumbent(n.) with a good-not-great economy and bad-not-terrible approval ratings *should win* around 51% of the vote. However, `主` the recession *set off* 引发；激起;使（炸弹等）爆炸 by covid-19 `谓` *has turned* the fundamentals *against him*.

- *set off* :  to start a process or series of events 引发；激起 +
-> Panic on the stock market *set off* a wave of selling. 股市恐慌引发了一轮抛售潮。

- 由于两届任期之害，这些因素正确地预测了特朗普在2016年的胜利。直到最近，他们还准备再次支持他:一个典型的现代在任者，在经济增长尚可而不优秀，支持率低而不糟糕的情况下，应该能赢得51%左右的选票。然而，covid-19引发的经济衰退使基本面对他不利。

`主` Just how much this *hurts* Mr Trump `系` *is hard to estimate*. First, no post-war president *has been saddled 给（马）备鞍 with* 使某人（或自己）肩负重担 an economic crash this deep. *Does* moving from 10% unemployment to 15% *hurt* an incumbent *as much as* moving from 5% to 10%? Second, whereas  （用以比较或对比两个事实）然而，但是，尽管 recovery from previous economic calamities(n.)灾难；灾祸 *has been* slow and grinding(a.)没完没了的；无休止的；无改进的, the easing of lockdowns *is likely to put* millions of Americans *back to work* before the election. *Come* November, *will* voters *punish* Mr Trump *for* the big decline since February, or *reward* him *for* a smaller gain since April? Finally, voters *may not treat* a recession caused by a pandemic *the same as* one with economic roots 根源；起因. Despite mass unemployment, Mr Trump’s approval rating *remains* above its lows of 2017.

- calamity : /kəˈlæməti/ n. an event that causes great damage to people's lives, property, etc. 灾难；灾祸 +

image:../../+ img_单词图片/c/calamity.jpg[100,100]

- 这对特朗普有多大伤害是难以估计的。首先，战后没有哪位总统遭受过如此严重的经济危机。失业率从10%上升到15%, 和从5%上升到10%, 对在职者的伤害一样大吗? 其次，尽管从以往的经济灾难中复苏, 是缓慢而艰难的，但放松封锁可能会让数百万美国人在大选前重返工作岗位。到了11月，选民是会因为特朗普自2月以来的大幅经济下跌而惩罚他，还是会因为他自4月以来的经济小幅上涨而奖励他? 最后，选民们可能不会把疫情大流行而造成的经济衰退, 与因为经济本身原因而造成的衰退, 相提并论。尽管存在大规模失业，但特朗普的支持率仍高于2017年的低点。

Our model *acknowledges* these unknowns [by ① *increasing* the uncertainty 犹豫；迟疑；无把握;拿不定的事；令人无把握的局面 in its predictions when economic conditions *differ vastly from* their historical norms 常态；正常行为, and ② *dampening* 抑制，控制，减弱（感情、反应等）;弄湿；使潮湿 the impact of unusually large booms and busts(打破；摔碎)繁荣与萧条(see chart 2)]. As a result, it *treats* the current downturn （商业经济的）衰退，下降，衰退期 *as* merely 40% worse than 2009, *rather than* twice as bad. This *is consistent(a.)与…一致的；相符的；符合的；不矛盾的 with* Mr Biden winning 53% of votes (*cast 投票 for* either him or Mr Trump) -- a margin （获胜者在时间或票数上领先的）幅度，差额，差数 halfway(ad.)在…的中间；在中途；到一半 between Mr Obama’s in 2008 and 2012, and one *similar to* his lead in the polls before the Floyd protests *began*.

- bust : v. to break sth 打破；摔碎 +
=> 是burst（爆炸、爆发）的变体 +
-> The lights *are busted*. 灯泡被砸碎了。

- halfway : ad. at an equal distance between two points; in the middle of a period of time 在…的中间；在中途；到一半 +
-> I'm afraid *we're not even halfway there yet*. 恐怕我们连一半的路都还没走完。

- 我们的模型承认这些未知因素，因此在当经济条件与历史常态相差很大时, 我们的模型会增加其预测的不确定性, 并将不寻常的经济繁荣或萧条, 对总统大选预测的影响度, 进行减轻(见表2). 因此, 我们的模型只是认为当前的经济低迷, 只比2009年糟糕40%，而不是两倍糟糕。这与拜登赢得了53%的投给他或特朗普的选票, 是一致的 -- 这一数值差距, 只是2008年和2012年时奥巴马得票率的一半，与弗洛伊德抗议活动开始前, 他在民调中的领先优势相似。

Such fundamentals, however, *are* only a starting-point. Early in a campaign, they *tend to predict* final results *far more reliably than* polls 民意测验；民意调查 do. Eventually, polls *reveal* whether voters *are indeed reacting to* the candidates *as the fundamentals imply* 含有…的意思；暗示；暗指;说明；表明.

- 然而，这些基本面只是一个起点。在竞选初期，它们往往会比民意调查更可靠地预测最终结果。最终，民意调查将揭示选民是否真的像基本面所暗示的那样对候选人做出反应。

Polls *are prone(a.)易于遭受；有做（坏事）的倾向 to* biases 偏见；偏心；偏向, above and beyond their stated margins of error 误差幅度；误差界限. Their results *vary*(v.)（根据情况）变化，变更，改变 *based on* ① whether they are conducted(v.)组织；安排；实施；执行 by phone or online, ② which demographic 人口统计学的 categories （人或事物的）类别，种类 (they *use* to weight 使加权 responses) and ③ how they *seek* to predict *who will turn out to vote*. Their results *can also oscillate* （情感或行为）摇摆，波动，变化 if one side’s partisans 坚定的支持者；铁杆拥护者 *become* unusually eager(a.) or disinclined(a.)不情愿；不乐意；无意于 *to answer* survey questions -- a phenomenon *known as* “partisan non-response bias”.

/ ( physics 物 ) ( of an electric current, radio waves, etc. 电流、无线电波等 ) to change in strength or direction at regular intervals 波动；振荡 +
=> 来自拉丁语os,嘴，词源同oral,-cill,小词后缀。原指在葡萄园入口处挂上的酒神Bacchus的面具，相当于庇佑符，以保佑葡萄丰收。因这个小面具常在风中摇摆，最终词义俗化，引申词义波动，使摇摆。 +

=> in-,进入，使，-cline,倾向，倾斜，词源同acclivity,decline. +
-> He *was strongly disinclined to believe anything* that she said. 她说什么他都坚决不肯相信。

- Non-response bias *occurs* in statistical surveys if the answers of respondents 回答问题的人；（尤指）调查对象 *differ from* the potential answers of those who did not answer. It *may occur* [due to several factors] [as *outlined* 概述；略述;显示…的轮廓；勾勒…的外形 in Deming (1990)]. +
*在统计调查中，如果被调查到的人, 做出的回答, 与那些没有被调查到的人会做出的潜在回答, 有不同，那么就会出现"无回答偏差"。* 正如Deming(1990)所描述的那样，它可能是由几个因素引起的.

- 民意调查的结果往往会有偏差，会高于或低于其声称的误差范围。其调查结果会因以下因素而有变化: 1. 调查方式是通过电话询问, 还是在网上进行的. 2. 调查者用何种人口统计分类, 来加权问卷上的回答的. 3. 调查者是如何预测哪些选民最终会去投票, 并去寻找他们来进行问卷调查的. 如果一方党派的支持者, 变得非常急迫, 或不愿意回答问卷问题, 则问卷调查的结果, 也会随之变化不定. 这种现象被称为“党派的无应答偏倚”。


Rather than *analysing* polls *individually* 分别地；单独地；各别地, our model *considers* them *collectively* 集体地，共同地. It *assumes that* `主` ① particular survey methods, ② weighting schemes 加权方式, ③ adjustments 调整；调节 for partisan non-response bias and ④ the like influence (reported) `谓` *results* （因…）发生；（随…）产生 [in unknown ways]. *Using* a statistical method *called* Markov Chain Monte Carlo 马尔可夫链蒙特卡尔理论, it then *estimates*  估价；估算 the impact of these factors, *by finding* the values for them (that best *explain* the differences in results(n.) between pollsters 民意调查者; 民意测验机构 (*surveying* （对…）做民意调查，进行民意测验;查看；审视；审察 similar places [at similar times])). Finally, it *blends* 使混合；掺和;（和某物）混合；融合 the resulting polling average *with* a forecast (*based on* fundamentals), *placing greater weight on* polls [as time goes on].

- 我们的模型不是单独来分析民意调查结果，而是将它们进行综合考虑。因为它假设, 1.特定的调查方法、2.加权方式、3.党派无反应偏差, 4.对"党派无应答偏倚"的纠偏调整, 5.及报道出来的类似的影响, 这些因素, 都在以未知的方式对民意调查结果造成影响. 所以我们的模型是综合考量所有这些因素影响的. +
我们的模型还使用"马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛统计方法", 并找出能最好的解释清楚"为什么在相同时间和相同地点的民意调查人员, 他们去做的问卷调查, 会结果不同"的原因变量值, 通过这些全部的发现, 来估算出上面5点因素的民意调查结果的影响作用. +
最后，它将得出的民意调查平均值, 与基于基本面的预测, 相结合，并随着时间的推移，会对民意调查给予更大的重视。


With the election (five months away), the model now *relies mostly on* fundamentals. These are sufficiently grim(a.)令人不快的；令人沮丧的;严肃的；坚定的；阴冷的 for Mr Trump that it *gives* him just a 5% chance of *getting* more votes(n.)选票；票 *than* Mr Biden does. However, his overall 全面的；综合的；总体的 odds of victory *are* about four times *higher than* that, *thanks to* a healthy chance that he *once again wins* the electoral college  总统选举团（在美国由各州选民投票推选组成，集中在一起选举总统和副总统） while *losing* the popular vote 普选；直接投票.

- 距离大选还有五个月，我们的模型现在主要依赖于基本面因素。这些对特朗普来说已经够严峻的了，他只有5%的机会比拜登获得更多的选票。然而，他获胜的总几率大约是这个数字的四倍，这是因为他很可能虽然会失去普选, 但却能再次赢得选举人团的青睐。



Reports of Mr Trump’s vice-like grip on the battleground states 摇摆州,战场州 *are* a bit premature 草率的；仓促的;未成熟的；过早的；提前的. States’ partisan leans relative to each other *shift frequently*. For example, in 2012 Barack Obama *won* Iowa by six percentage points while *losing* Texas by 16. Four years later, Mrs Clinton *came closer to* 接近 winning(v.) Texas than Iowa. Such volatility 波动性;易变;挥发性 *means* advantages in the electoral college *can be* short-lived 短暂的. *Had* the national popular vote *been tied* （用线、绳等）系，拴，绑，捆，束 every year, the college *would have delivered* the presidency 主席的职位（或任期等）；总统的职位（或任期等） *to* Democrats in four of the five elections from 1996 to 2012 (see chart 3).

- volatile : /ˈvɑːlətl/ a. ( often disapproving ) ( of a person or their moods 人或其情绪 ) changing easily from one mood to another 易变的；无定性的；无常性的 / ( of a situation 情况 ) likely to change suddenly; easily becoming dangerous 可能急剧波动的；不稳定的；易恶化的 +
=> 来自拉丁语 volare,飞，可能来自 will,意愿，引申词义浮动的，挥发的。 +
-> *a highly volatile personality* 反复无常的个性 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/v/volatile.jpg[100,100]

- 有关特朗普像副总统一样掌控着摇摆州的报道, 有点为时尚早。州之间的党派倾向经常发生变化。例如，2012年，巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)以6个百分点的优势赢得了爱荷华州，却以16个百分点的劣势输掉了德克萨斯州。四年后，希拉里赢得德克萨斯州的几率, 比赢得爱荷华州的几率更小。这种不确定性意味着选举人团的优势可能是短暂的。如果每年的全国普选票数都是相同的，那么从1996年到2012年的5次选举中，选举人团就会有4次将总统职位交给了民主党人(见图3)。


There *is* no guarantee 保证；担保 that the electoral college *will continue to favour* Mr Trump. Mr Biden *has fared well* in polls  民意测验；民意调查 of Arizona, whose Republican lean *has shrunk* since 2016. The state *could provide* him *with* another path to victory [if he *cannot wrest 攫取，抢夺（权力） back* Wisconsin 威斯康星州] -- or, *along with* 连同…一起 Florida, a sunbelt 阳光地带（美国南部和西南部地区，全年大部分时间气候温暖） alternative to the entire rustbelt 铁锈地带（指从前工业繁盛,今已衰落的发达国家一些地区）（尤指美国北部衰败或萧条的工业区）.

- rustbelt : 铁锈地带. 最初指的是美国东北部-五大湖附近，传统工业衰退的地区，现可泛指工业衰退的地区。 +
美国东北部-五大湖附近因为水运便利、矿产丰富，因此成为了重工业中心。然而自从美国步入第三产业为主导的经济体系之后，这些地区的重工业纷纷衰败。很多工厂被废弃，而工厂里的机器渐渐布满了铁锈，因此那里被称为了铁锈地带，简称锈带。 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/r/rustbelt.jpg[200,200]

- 不能保证选举团会继续支持特朗普。拜登在亚利桑那州的民调中表现良好，该州的共和党优势自2016年以来已经缩小。如果他不能夺回威斯康辛州，亚利桑那州可以为他提供另一条通往胜利的道路。或者还有佛罗里达州也能为他提供胜利, 佛罗里达州可以作为整个“铁锈带”州的另一个选择.

At the same time, *there is also no evidence that* Mr Trump’s electoral-college advantage *has dwindled* （逐渐）减少，变小，缩小. In 2016 his vote share (excluding third parties) in Wisconsin, the state that *delivered* him the election, was 1.4 percentage points *higher than* his performance overall. Today, our model *puts* Mr Biden *on* track *to win* 53.5% of the nationwide two-party vote, and 52% in Pennsylvania, the most likely decisive 决定性的；关键的 state -- a nearly identical 完全同样的；相同的 gap of 1.5 points.

- dwindle : /ˈdwɪndl/ [ V ] *~ (away) (to sth)* to become gradually less or smaller （逐渐）减少，变小，缩小 +
=> 词源同dye, 死亡，消逝。-le, 表反复，逐渐。即减少，逐渐消亡。 +
-> Support for the party *has dwindled away to nothing*. 支持这个党派的人渐渐化为乌有。

- 与此同时，也没有证据表明特朗普的选举人团优势已经减弱。2016年，他在威斯康辛州的得票率(不包括第三党派)比他的整体表现高出1.4个百分点。威斯康辛州是他赢得大选的州。今天，我们的模型显示拜登在全国范围内赢得了53.5%的两党选票，在宾夕法尼亚州赢得了52%的选票，宾夕法尼亚州是最有可能决定胜负的州. 这个差距几乎与特朗普当年在此州高出的那个1.4%相同，如今则是拜登高出1.5个百分点。

An electoral-college advantage of this size *would not save* Mr Trump if Mr Biden’s lead *remains* near its current level. But if Mr Trump *were* to cut Mr Biden’s edge in half, the current state of the electoral map *would make him* highly competitive. In such a scenario 设想；方案；预测, Mr Biden *would win* the popular vote 普选；直接投票 *by* as much as Mr Obama did in 2012 -- and *be rewarded with* a near-tie 平局；得分相同；不分胜负 and possibly a disputed 有争议的 election.

- tie : n.  a situation in a game or competition when two or more players have the same score 平局；得分相同；不分胜负 +
-> The match *ended in a tie*. 这场比赛以平局结束。

As the underdog  处于劣势的人（或团队、国家等）；弱者；比赛前不被看好者, Mr Trump *should welcome* this uncertainty. His chances of re-election *are* far greater than Mr Biden’s *were* (in late February of *winning* the Democratic nomination).

- eerie : /ˈɪri/ a. strange, mysterious and frightening 怪异的；神秘的；恐怖的 +

In early June, it gives Donald Trump a one-in-five shot at re-election

Jun 11th 2020 |


FOUR MONTHS ago, Donald Trump’s odds of winning a second term had never looked better. After an easy acquittal in his impeachment trial, his approval rating had reached its highest level in three years, and was approaching the upper-40s range that delivered re-election to George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Unemployment was at a 50-year low, setting him up to take credit for a strong economy. And Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist, had won the popular vote in each of the first three Democratic primary contests.

But even by Mr Trump’s frenetic standards, the tumble in his political stock since then has been remarkably abrupt. First, Joe Biden, Barack Obama’s moderate and well-liked vice-president, pulled off a comeback for the ages, surging from the verge of dropping out to presumptive nominee. Then covid-19 battered America, claiming at least 110,000 lives and 30m jobs. And just when deaths from the virus began to taper off, protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd convulsed cities across America. Mr Trump’s callous response has widened the empathy gap separating him from Mr Biden into a chasm.

Even at the president’s high-water mark in February, he trailed Mr Biden by five percentage points in national polling averages. That deficit has now swelled to eight. Polls of swing states tell a similar tale. Mr Biden is not only ahead in the midwestern battlegrounds that elected Mr Trump the first time, but also in Florida and Arizona. Even states that Mr Trump won easily in 2016, such as Georgia, Texas, Iowa and Ohio, look competitive. There is little question that if the election were held today, Mr Biden would win in a near-landslide.

The election, of course, will not be held today. In fact, more time remains between now and November 3rd than has passed since Mr Trump’s impeachment trial. And given the devotion of the president’s base, Mr Biden is probably approaching his electoral ceiling, whereas Mr Trump has plenty of room to win back soft supporters.



Burning down the House

Indeed, there are good reasons to expect he will. First, the latest jobs report suggests that the economy may have bottomed out. In 1984 Ronald Reagan trounced Walter Mondale by declaring “Morning in America”, though unemployment remained high by historical standards. Mr Trump plans to make the same argument. The Black Lives Matter protests could also backfire on Democrats if they rally white voters behind the “law and order” candidate, as they are thought to have done in 1968.



Given all this uncertainty, it is tempting to conclude that it is too early for predictions, and call the election a virtual toss-up. That is the view of bettors, who currently make Mr Biden a bare 55-45 favourite. Yet a hard look at the data and at history suggests that this is too generous to Mr Trump. The Economist’s first-ever statistical forecast of an American presidential race, which we launch this week and will update every day until the election, gives Mr Biden an 82% chance of victory.

Mr Trump’s unlikely triumph in 2016 left many quantitative election forecasters looking silly. Sam Wang, a professor at Princeton, vowed to eat a bug if Mr Trump, whom he said had just a 1% chance of victory in November 2016, came even close to winning. (He chose a cricket.)

However, statistical models that used a historically accurate amount of polling error, and factored in the tendency of such errors to benefit the same candidate in similar states, actually fared rather well. Given that Hillary Clinton led polls both nationwide and in a sufficient number of states to deliver her the electoral college, no rigorous forecast on the day of the election could have anointed Mr Trump the favourite. But numerous models put her chances at below 85%, and some were as low as 70%. (When applied retroactively to 2016, our own election-day forecast would have given Mrs Clinton a 71% shot—roughly the same probability it would have assigned to Mr Obama beating Mitt Romney on election day in 2012.) Just as solid number-crunching revealed the brittleness of Mrs Clinton’s position, we hope it will shed similar light on this year’s race.

Like most forecasts, our model, built with the aid of two academics from Columbia, Andrew Gelman and Merlin Heidemanns, applies past patterns of voters’ behaviour to new circumstances. Its stated probability of victory answers the question: “How often have previous candidates in similar positions gone on to win?” If those historical relationships break down, our forecast will misfire. But one of the paradoxes presented by Mr Trump’s unprecedented presidency is that voters have mostly treated him as they would handle any other Republican.



Our analysis begins with “fundamentals”, or structural factors that shape the public’s choices. Predictably, when presidents have high approval ratings, their parties’ candidates tend to get more votes (see chart 1). Incumbents seeking re-election also fare better if the economy does well, though growing partisan polarisation has shrunk this effect. And voters seem to have an “eight-year itch”: only once since term limits were enacted in 1951 has the same party won three times in a row.

Because of the two-term penalty, these factors correctly predicted Mr Trump’s victory in 2016. Until recently, they were poised to favour him again: a typical modern incumbent with a good-not-great economy and bad-not-terrible approval ratings should win around 51% of the vote. However, the recession set off by covid-19 has turned the fundamentals against him.

Just how much this hurts Mr Trump is hard to estimate. First, no post-war president has been saddled with an economic crash this deep. Does moving from 10% unemployment to 15% hurt an incumbent as much as moving from 5% to 10%? Second, whereas recovery from previous economic calamities has been slow and grinding, the easing of lockdowns is likely to put millions of Americans back to work before the election. Come November, will voters punish Mr Trump for the big decline since February, or reward him for a smaller gain since April? Finally, voters may not treat a recession caused by a pandemic the same as one with economic roots. Despite mass unemployment, Mr Trump’s approval rating remains above its lows of 2017.



Our model acknowledges these unknowns by increasing the uncertainty in its predictions when economic conditions differ vastly from their historical norms, and dampening the impact of unusually large booms and busts (see chart 2). As a result, it treats the current downturn as merely 40% worse than 2009, rather than twice as bad. This is consistent with Mr Biden winning 53% of votes cast for either him or Mr Trump—a margin halfway between Mr Obama’s in 2008 and 2012, and one similar to his lead in the polls before the Floyd protests began.

Such fundamentals, however, are only a starting-point. Early in a campaign, they tend to predict final results far more reliably than polls do. Eventually, polls reveal whether voters are indeed reacting to the candidates as the fundamentals imply.

Polls are prone to biases, above and beyond their stated margins of error. Their results vary based on whether they are conducted by phone or online, which demographic categories they use to weight responses and how they seek to predict who will turn out to vote. Their results can also oscillate if one side’s partisans become unusually eager or disinclined to answer survey questions—a phenomenon known as “partisan non-response bias”.

Rather than analysing polls individually, our model considers them collectively. It assumes that particular survey methods, weighting schemes, adjustments for partisan non-response bias and the like influence reported results in unknown ways. Using a statistical method called Markov Chain Monte Carlo, it then estimates the impact of these factors, by finding the values for them that best explain the differences in results between pollsters surveying similar places at similar times. Finally, it blends the resulting polling average with a forecast based on fundamentals, placing greater weight on polls as time goes on.

With the election five months away, the model now relies mostly on fundamentals. These are sufficiently grim for Mr Trump that it gives him just a 5% chance of getting more votes than Mr Biden does. However, his overall odds of victory are about four times higher than that, thanks to a healthy chance that he once again wins the electoral college while losing the popular vote.



Reports of Mr Trump’s vice-like grip on the battleground states are a bit premature. States’ partisan leans relative to each other shift frequently. For example, in 2012 Barack Obama won Iowa by six percentage points while losing Texas by 16. Four years later, Mrs Clinton came closer to winning Texas than Iowa. Such volatility means advantages in the electoral college can be short-lived. Had the national popular vote been tied every year, the college would have delivered the presidency to Democrats in four of the five elections from 1996 to 2012 (see chart 3).

There is no guarantee that the electoral college will continue to favour Mr Trump. Mr Biden has fared well in polls of Arizona, whose Republican lean has shrunk since 2016. The state could provide him with another path to victory if he cannot wrest back Wisconsin—or, along with Florida, a sunbelt alternative to the entire rustbelt.

At the same time, there is also no evidence that Mr Trump’s electoral-college advantage has dwindled. In 2016 his vote share (excluding third parties) in Wisconsin, the state that delivered him the election, was 1.4 percentage points higher than his performance overall. Today, our model puts Mr Biden on track to win 53.5% of the nationwide two-party vote, and 52% in Pennsylvania, the most likely decisive state—a nearly identical gap of 1.5 points.

An electoral-college advantage of this size would not save Mr Trump if Mr Biden’s lead remains near its current level. But if Mr Trump were to cut Mr Biden’s edge in half, the current state of the electoral map would make him highly competitive. In such a scenario, Mr Biden would win the popular vote by as much as Mr Obama did in 2012—and be rewarded with a near-tie and possibly a disputed election.

The eerie resemblance between our estimate of Mr Biden’s chances and many calculations of Mrs Clinton’s odds four years ago may give Democrats a sense of déjà vu. Now as then, Mr Trump has a clear path to victory. An accelerating economic recovery, a continuing edge in battleground states, and an ill-timed gaffe, senior moment or scandal from Mr Biden could do the trick. Our model does not account for the impact of covid-19 on voter turnout (or, potentially, on the health of the two geriatric male nominees). As the underdog, Mr Trump should welcome this uncertainty. His chances of re-election are far greater than Mr Biden’s were in late February of winning the Democratic nomination.

But just as it was wrong to count Mr Trump out four years ago, it is wrong to regard him as invincible now. In 2016 polls favoured Mrs Clinton, whereas fundamentals favoured Mr Trump.

This time, history suggests that the electorate will punish an unpopular incumbent saddled with a depressed economy, and voters are currently telling pollsters they plan to do just that. What Mr Biden needs to do is run out the clock.
