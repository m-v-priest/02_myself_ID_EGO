But the going 进展速度；难度 *is* rough *along* the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime(a.)海的；海事的；海运的；船舶的 Silk Road, *to give* the scheme *its full name*. Since 2013, when Mr Xi *first began talking about* these new silk roads, China *has given or promised* hundreds of billions of dollars in loans and grants （政府、机构的）拨款 for power plants 发电站, ports, railways, roads and other infrastructure in Africa, Latin America, South-East Asia, Central Asia and Europe (see chart 1). But as a result of covid-19, work on some projects *has come to a halt*.

- technical default 技术性违约. “技术性违约”指延缓支付到期债务利息.


In February Egypt *postponed indefinitely* 无限期地 China-funded construction of what *was* to be the world’s second-largest coal-fired 用煤作燃料的；烧煤的 power plant, at Hamrawein. The following month Bangladesh *cancelled* plans for a coal 煤 plant at Gazaria. In April Pakistan *asked* China *for* easier repayment terms （协议、合同等的）条件，条款 on $30bn-worth of power projects 电力项目. In April Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, *said* he *would cancel* a $10bn port project 港口项目 at Bagamoyo because it *was signed* (by his predecessor 前任) *with conditions* that “only a drunkard” 酒鬼；醉鬼 *would accept* -- *chiefly 主要地；首要地, that* China *would gain* full control of the port with a 99-year lease （房屋、设备或土地的）租约，租契.

African leaders *have called for* emergency debt-forgiveness 债务减免 from sovereign 有主权的；完全独立的;掌握全部权力的；有至高无上的权力的 creditors 债权人；债主；贷方 including China, which *is owed* 欠（债）；欠（账） about $8bn this year in payments on about $145bn in loans to African countries, many *involving* BRI projects (see article).

- 今年5月，尼日利亚议员投票赞成审查中国为中国项目提供的所有贷款，原因是担心融资协议可能以不利的条款达成。非洲领导人呼吁包括中国在内的主权债权国, 紧急免除非洲的债务，今年，中国向非洲国家提供了约1450亿美元的贷款，其中许多涉及“一带一路”项目，中国今年被拖欠约80亿美元。


Work *has also been delayed* by quarantine and safety measures *related to* the pandemic, *including* restrictions *imposed by* some countries [on the return of Chinese workers who *had gone back to China* for the lunar new-year holiday in January]. In Vietnam such impediments 妨碍；阻碍；障碍 *have delayed* a 20-day test(n.) of a new metro line 地铁线路 in Hanoi 河内（越南首都） -- `主` more than 100 Chinese experts *involved in* building it `谓` *have been unable to re-enter* the country. The project *was* already at least four years behind schedule and, at a cost of nearly $800m for eight miles of track, *massively over* budget.

- 该项目已经比原计划晚了至少4年. 8英里的铁轨, 花费了近8亿美元，大大超出预算。

This *presents* problems for China’s leaders in the realms of economics, diplomacy and politics at home, where the BRI *is closely linked with* the prestige 威信；声望；威望 of Mr Xi. First, there *will be* financial losses. Many countries *raise(v.) the cash for BRI projects* by exporting(v.) commodities. But the pandemic *has hit demand* for them. *Should* China *reduce* the amount 金额;数量；数额 (*owed*), as sovereign lenders *sometimes do* in response to a financial crisis? Or *should it try to preserve* [as many] loans and BRI projects [as] it *can* by delaying(v.) payments and *extending* terms 延长贷款期限 (its typical approach)? Either way, experts *say*, a wave of defaults *is* inevitable.

- prestige :  威信；声望；威望 => 来自prae,在前面，stringere,拉，拉绳子，捆绑，词源同string.该词原用于形容法国皇帝拿破仑像个街头玩变戏法的，含贬义和讽刺意味，后随着越来越多的人崇拜拿破仑，词义由贬义转褒义.

- 这给中国领导人带来了国内经济、外交和政治领域的问题，在这些领域，一带一路与习主席的声望息息相关。首先，中国会有财务损失。许多国家通过出口商品, 来给一带一路项目还贷。但疫情大流行打击了它们出口的商品的需求。中国是否应该像主权贷款机构在应对金融危机时有时所做的那样，减免债务数额? 还是应该通过推迟还款和延长期限(这是典型的做法)，尽可能多地保留贷款和一带一路项目？专家说，无论选择哪种方式，违约浪潮都是不可避免的。


In April, amid debtors’ 债务人；借方 growing(a.) calls(n.) for help, the G20, which includes China, *broadly agreed* to allow(v.) up to 73 countries *to suspend* debt-service 债务还本付息 payments *totalling*(v.)总数达；共计 about $12bn-14bn until the end of the year. But the devil *is* in the details. The G20 *warns that* applying for a suspension of debt-service payments *could breach （对法规等的）违背，违犯; 在…上打开缺口 other terms* to which a country may have agreed. *Unlike* members of the Paris Club of big sovereign lenders, who *do not require* collateral 抵押物；担保品 for their development loans, China’s banks *do* for about 60% of their lending(n.) to developing countries, *says* Carmen Reinhart, the World Bank’s incoming 新当选的；新任的 chief economist. [In theory] a country *could apply （通常以书面形式）申请，请求 for* debt relief 债务免除 *only to find that* China *could claim* the rights to a mine 矿井；矿, a port or money *held* in escrow  暂交第三者保管的款项(或资产). This is one reason why China’s banks *prefer to renegotiate* 重新谈判(之前已同意的条款) sovereign loans 主权贷款 *bilaterally* 双边地；双方面地, and [in secret]. They *have* leverage 杠杆作用；杠杆效力;影响力, and *can choose* how to apply it.

- collateral : /kəˈlætərəl/ [ U ] ( finance 财 ) property or sth valuable that you promise to give to sb if you cannot pay back money that you borrow 抵押物；担保品 / a. ( formal ) connected with sth else, but in addition to it and less important 附属的；附加的；附带的 +
=> col-, 强调。-later, 边，词源同lateral. 即放在旁边作为抵押物品的。 +
-> collateral benefits 附加津贴

- escrow : /ɛs'kro/ N-UNCOUNT Escrow is money or property that is given to someone, but kept by another person until the first person has done a particular thing or met particular requirements. 暂交第三者保管的款项(或资产) +
=> 来自中世纪英语escrowl("scroll"), 来自古法语escroc. +
-> His stake *has been held in escrow* since the start of the year. 自年初，他的股份已经交由第三方暂时保管。 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/e/escrow.jpg[100,100]

- Sovereign loans : 主权贷款. 指对外国政府的贷款，属于国际贷款。 +
有的时候这种贷款存在严重的执行问题。对于主权贷款来说，如果外国债务人有偿付问题时，贷方要收回贷款是很困难的，因为贷方和借方处于不同的国家，依法执行合同的难度很大，强迫外国政府偿还债务是极其困难的。

- 今年4月，在债务国呼声越来越高的情况下，包括中国在内的20国集团(G20)大致同意，允许至多73个国家, 在年底前暂停偿还总额约为120亿至140亿美元的债务。但魔鬼存在于细节中。G20警告说，申请暂停偿债, 可能会违反一个国家可能已经同意的其他条款。世界银行(World Bank)即将上任的首席经济学家卡门·莱因哈特(Carmen Reinhart)表示，由大型主权贷款机构组成的巴黎俱乐部(Paris Club)成员, 不要求发展中国家来提供抵押品, 以获得发展贷款. 但与此不同, 中国的银行向发展中国家提供的贷款中, 约有60%需要抵押品。从理论上讲，一个国家能去申请债务减免，但结果却会发现, 中国可以可以主张对其拥有的矿山、港口或第三方托管资金的权利。这就是为什么中国的银行更愿意私下双边地, 来重新谈判主权贷款的原因之一。他们手中有杠杆，可以选择如何运用它。


But this *is* where diplomatic risk *will loom large* for China. `主` *Claiming* assets from defaulting 不履行 (义务); 违约 countries `谓` *would create* a furore(n.)群情激愤；骚动；轰动. It *would damage* China’s image in countries that the BRI *was intended to help*, and *strengthen* suspicions among Western hawks *that* China is using the BRI to saddle(v.)使某人（或自己）肩负重担; 给（马）备鞍 countries with debt (see chart 2) and thereby *gain* control of infrastructure that could help it strategically 战略性地；战略上. “If they *thought* they were facing a backlash （对社会变动等的）强烈抵制，集体反对 now, *it would be really severe*(a.)极为恶劣的；十分严重的 for them” if they *were* to seize(v.)起获；没收；扣押;（常指通过暴力突然）夺取，攻占，控制 collateral 抵押物；担保品, says Scott Morris of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank in Washington. China *may decide to tread warily* 警惕地；谨慎地；留心地. Until the global economy *recovers*, there *will certainly be* fewer new BRI projects. “*It feels hard to imagine* the initiative *maintaining* the level of ambition *that it had*,” says Mr Morris.

- furor :  /ˈfjʊrɔːr/  n. ( especially in NAmE *furor*   /ˈfjʊərɔː(r)/   ) *~ (about/over sth)* great anger or excitement shown by a number of people, usually caused by a public event 群情激愤；骚动；轰动 +
=> 借自意大利语furore, 来自拉丁语furor. +
=> *the recent furore* over the tax increases 近来因增税引起的骚动

- saddle => 马鞍. sad-部分同sit，而-dle部分实际表工具，因saddle是你能够坐到马背上的工具。

- 如果他们认为自己现在面临的是强烈反对，那么(如果他们选择没收抵押品, 则后果)对他们来说将是非常严重的。
- 在全球经济复苏之前，“一带一路”新项目肯定会减少。莫里斯表示:“很难想象该计划能保持过去的雄心壮志。”

=> 原为窃贼行话，来自中古英语 tuten,偷窥，偷看，放风。现词义可能改写自 toot,发出嘟嘟声， 鸣喇叭，引申词义大吹法螺，后用于指吹嘘，兜售，倒卖门票等。 +

But, as with multilateral 多边的；多国的 lenders such as the World Bank, the financial muscle behind it *looks* puny(a.)弱小的；孱弱的;不起眼的；可怜的；微不足道的 [in comparison]. “The BRI *has* the best promise 获得成功的迹象 of *meeting* 满足；使满意 the glaring 显眼的；明显的；易见的; 刺眼的；炫目的 infrastructure gaps in the global economy,” Mr Gallagher says. “There’s no global infrastructure surge(n.)（数量的）急剧上升，激增；大量；一大批 without the BRI.” But for the moment, that boost 帮助；激励;增长；提高 *will have to wait*.

- puny => 来自古法语puisne,最小的，最后出生的，来自puis,以后，在后，来自拉丁语post,在后。-ne,出生，词源同natal.引申词义小的，弱的，劣质的，孱弱的。

== Break time

(eco 2020.6.6 / China / The Belt and Road Initiative: Break time)

The pandemic is hurting China’s Belt and Road Initiative

How will Xi Jinping’s biggest project survive?

Jun 4th 2020 |


Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our coronavirus hub

JUST OVER a year ago, at a gathering in Beijing of world leaders who had signed up to his Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s president, Xi Jinping, peppered his speech with proverbs. “The ceaseless inflow of rivers makes the ocean deep,” was one—a reference to how his scheme, involving huge spending on infrastructure in other countries, would promote the global flow of goods, capital and technology and with them, economic growth. Amid the pandemic, many countries may be wishing this were so. But some BRI projects are stalling as countries struggle to repay related debts. China’s own economy is faltering, too. Silk roads are getting bumpier.

The BRI is the centrepiece of Mr Xi’s foreign policy. In 2017 he gave it hallowed political status by having it written into the Communist Party’s constitution. Lauding it thereby became obligatory. China’s state-owned media are duly doing so. “BRI co-operation is entering a stage of high-quality development,” said a headline in Global Times, a party-owned tabloid. “The BRI will become a catalyst for global economic recovery,” said another on the website of the party’s mouthpiece, the People’s Daily.

But the going is rough along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road, to give the scheme its full name. Since 2013, when Mr Xi first began talking about these new silk roads, China has given or promised hundreds of billions of dollars in loans and grants for power plants, ports, railways, roads and other infrastructure in Africa, Latin America, South-East Asia, Central Asia and Europe (see chart 1). But as a result of covid-19, work on some projects has come to a halt. A few have been scrapped. Several that seemed of dubious worth even before the pandemic now look like white elephants. Many of the loans are on the brink of technical default, as debtor countries—hammered by covid-19—seek to defer payments that are coming due.



In February Egypt postponed indefinitely China-funded construction of what was to be the world’s second-largest coal-fired power plant, at Hamrawein. The following month Bangladesh cancelled plans for a coal plant at Gazaria. In April Pakistan asked China for easier repayment terms on $30bn-worth of power projects. In April Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, said he would cancel a $10bn port project at Bagamoyo because it was signed (by his predecessor) with conditions that “only a drunkard” would accept—chiefly, that China would gain full control of the port with a 99-year lease. And in May, Nigerian legislators voted for a review of all of China’s loans for Chinese projects amid concerns that financing may have been agreed on unfavourable terms. African leaders have called for emergency debt-forgiveness from sovereign creditors including China, which is owed about $8bn this year in payments on about $145bn in loans to African countries, many involving BRI projects (see article).

Work has also been delayed by quarantine and safety measures related to the pandemic, including restrictions imposed by some countries on the return of Chinese workers who had gone back to China for the lunar new-year holiday in January. In Vietnam such impediments have delayed a 20-day test of a new metro line in Hanoi—more than 100 Chinese experts involved in building it have been unable to re-enter the country. The project was already at least four years behind schedule and, at a cost of nearly $800m for eight miles of track, massively over budget.

This presents problems for China’s leaders in the realms of economics, diplomacy and politics at home, where the BRI is closely linked with the prestige of Mr Xi. First, there will be financial losses. Many countries raise the cash for BRI projects by exporting commodities. But the pandemic has hit demand for them. Should China reduce the amount owed, as sovereign lenders sometimes do in response to a financial crisis? Or should it try to preserve as many loans and BRI projects as it can by delaying payments and extending terms (its typical approach)? Either way, experts say, a wave of defaults is inevitable.

In April, amid debtors’ growing calls for help, the G20, which includes China, broadly agreed to allow up to 73 countries to suspend debt-service payments totalling about $12bn-14bn until the end of the year. But the devil is in the details. The G20 warns that applying for a suspension of debt-service payments could breach other terms to which a country may have agreed. Unlike members of the Paris Club of big sovereign lenders, who do not require collateral for their development loans, China’s banks do for about 60% of their lending to developing countries, says Carmen Reinhart, the World Bank’s incoming chief economist. In theory a country could apply for debt relief only to find that China could claim the rights to a mine, a port or money held in escrow. This is one reason why China’s banks prefer to renegotiate sovereign loans bilaterally, and in secret. They have leverage, and can choose how to apply it.

But this is where diplomatic risk will loom large for China. Claiming assets from defaulting countries would create a furore. It would damage China’s image in countries that the BRI was intended to help, and strengthen suspicions among Western hawks that China is using the BRI to saddle countries with debt (see chart 2) and thereby gain control of infrastructure that could help it strategically. “If they thought they were facing a backlash now, it would be really severe for them” if they were to seize collateral, says Scott Morris of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank in Washington. China may decide to tread warily. Until the global economy recovers, there will certainly be fewer new BRI projects. “It feels hard to imagine the initiative maintaining the level of ambition that it had,” says Mr Morris.



However, given the political importance China attaches to the BRI at home, and the effort it has made to persuade countries to sign documents endorsing it (more than 130 have, most of them non-Western), it is unlikely to let the idea drop. Fortunately for China’s propagandists, the BRI is a shape-shifting concept that allows them to adapt it to changing circumstances. Hitherto its focus has been on building hard infrastructure. But the term is often applied to almost any activity abroad involving big Chinese firms that can be touted as helping to create a “Silk Road of Peace”—in other words, it means anything the Chinese government likes. Amid the pandemic, officials can easily play down the pouring of concrete and stress other kinds of Chinese largesse.

Under the banner of the BRI, officials are now lauding the idea of a “Health Silk Road” to help distribute medical support and food aid. The idea harks back to the first speech Mr Xi gave, in 2013, about his plans for a Maritime Silk Road. In it he recalled at length how, nine years earlier, China had responded to the Indian Ocean tsunami by mounting its biggest-ever relief operation overseas. In Indonesia, he said, many local people had learned to speak Chinese and hailed members of the Chinese rescue team with the words: “China, Beijing, I love you.” China expects that the BRI-branded medical supplies which it is now showering on covid-struck countries will prompt similar expressions of gratitude. Focusing on such assistance makes political sense for China. It can make a big difference to recipients’ efforts to fight the disease, and requires far less cash than a port or railway.

Also gaining more prominence is the vaguely defined idea of a “Digital Silk Road”. It has been adapted for pandemic use to include helping other countries replicate China’s successes with app-based approaches to tracking the coronavirus.

Chinese officials may take advantage of the lull in building-work to think again about which projects are necessary. They have been stung by Western criticism of the social and environmental costs of BRI infrastructure and of the opaque deals involved. At last year’s meeting with world leaders, Mr Xi stressed that the BRI should be “open, green and clean”. The pandemic offers a chance quietly to nix unpopular dams, which can suffer costly delays due to protests, and dirty coal plants, which are not a sound investment anyway. “Nobody on Wall Street will tell you that a coal plant will be affordable 40 years from now,” says Kevin Gallagher at Boston University. Instead, China may push the expansion of solar and wind energy. Mr Gallagher notes that in Pakistan, Chinese firms have built multiple wind farms under the auspices of BRI. “If you ask for that stuff, China has it.”

If done right, without drowning countries in debt, BRI projects may yet provide a welcome boost to the global economy. Before the pandemic the World Bank estimated that BRI transport projects in Asia, including high-speed railways, would boost the GDP of participating countries by up to 3.4% overall. Some of those rail projects have stalled, and China is now preoccupied with its own hard-hit economy. But Daniel Rosen of Rhodium Group, a research firm, argues that China’s policy banks have ample capacity to maintain the present level of BRI lending. It just is not economically prudent for them do so, especially before a global recovery is on track.

When that happens, the BRI may revert to its original focus. And many countries in desperate need of better infrastructure will welcome this. They have few other options. In November America, Japan and Australia announced an alternative to the BRI called the “Blue Dot Network” to fund infrastructure projects in the developing world. But, as with multilateral lenders such as the World Bank, the financial muscle behind it looks puny in comparison. “The BRI has the best promise of meeting the glaring infrastructure gaps in the global economy,” Mr Gallagher says. “There’s no global infrastructure surge without the BRI.” But for the moment, that boost will have to wait.

== A guide for foreign workers at Chinese firms

(eco 2020-06-06 / Business / Bartleby: Cultural challenge )

When Western workers meet Chinese bosses

Jun 4th 2020 |


THE CORONAVIRUS pandemic has led to some testy moments in diplomatic relations between China and the democratic world. But in the long run, China’s economic power is likely to increase and that means more foreigners may end up working for Chinese corporations.

In a fascinating and detailed book, “Barriers to Entry: Overcoming Challenges and Achieving Breakthroughs in a Chinese Workplace”, Paul Ross, an executive who has worked in China, describes some of the difficulties workers face. There is plenty of scope for misunderstandings. A common complaint of foreign employees working for Chinese firms is that they do not always understand what is expected from them nor do they find the guidance they receive from Chinese managers satisfactory.

That may be down to differences in corporate culture. Sociological studies show that Chinese culture is more collectivist and displays a greater respect for authority than elsewhere (although a nation of 1.4bn people will not have a uniform mindset). Mr Ross says Chinese workers rely on informal communication for information and guidance, obviating the need for more formal definitions of their duties. As a result, one American who worked for a Chinese group concluded that the ideal Western candidate was someone who was comfortable with uncertainty, rapid and unexpected change, and taking the initiative to find their own direction.

Workers cannot count on getting lots of positive feedback either. But Mr Ross counsels that Chinese bosses who come across as too critical may just be struggling to find their footing.

The relationship between manager and staff is more hierarchical than Western workers might expect, the author says. Chinese managers occasionally ask staff to run errands or do small, personal jobs. Challenging the boss is not a good idea. Mr Ross says employees should never shoot down a boss’s idea directly. If there is a difficulty in implementing the plan, they should blame it on outside factors.

Working long hours seems to be a way of expressing group solidarity in Chinese companies even though it is not always the most efficient use of time. Reviews by Western employees on Glassdoor, a website where workers can write about their companies, suggest that a lack of work-life balance is the most negative factor. In particular, employees are expected to attend after-work functions as a way of showing team spirit. Chinese companies spend a lot of money on events that are designed to bring workers together. Mr Ross says that such shindigs are an important way of transmitting the corporate culture to their staff. So recruits need to take part.

Even so, foreign workers may struggle to be accepted. One person who worked at the Belgian outpost of ZTE, a telecoms-equipment provider, recalled that the Chinese staff sat in a large open space in the middle of the office while the local staff occupied a small office at the end of the hall. Mr Ross suggests offering to teach colleagues English as a way to establish relationships, leading to collaboration in other areas.

Another problem is that foreign employees can find it hard to work their way up the career ladder. One game developer at Tencent concluded that leaving the company for a competitor and then rejoining at a higher level was the best way of getting promoted.

A further cultural difference is in the style of presentations. Chinese executives don’t reveal anywhere near as many personal details in their speeches as Western CEOs. Presenters don’t tend to make eye contact with the audience but read the text off a laptop they bring on stage. Slides tend to be packed with detail as a way of imparting information. Western-style slides with lots of space are seen as lacking useful content.

Despite all these differences, the trend for foreign workers to join Chinese companies is likely to continue, even if businesses from the People’s Republic are barred from making acquisitions abroad. Many foreigners want to work for a Chinese firm because they think it will enable them to develop skills and knowledge that would help their careers.
