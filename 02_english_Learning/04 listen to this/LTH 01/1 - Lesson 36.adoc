==== A. Making a Reservation. +

Robert Gordon is phoning to book a hotel room in Paris. +
Receptionist: 45-21-64. Allo? +
Robert: Is that the Saint-Martine Hotel? +
Receptionist: Oui. Yes, it is. Can I help you? +
Robert: Have you got a double room for the night of 23rd July? +
Receptionist: One moment please. I'll just have a look. Yes, we have got a double room
on that date. +
Robert: Has it got a double bed or two singles? +
Receptionist: Two singles, monsieur. +
Robert: And is that with or without bath? +
Receptionist: It's a room with shower and toilet, monsieur. +
Robert: That sounds fine. Is there a TV? +
Receptionist: Could you repeat that, please? +

==== B. Vet. +

Interviewer: Now you've been a veterinary doctor for some thirty years, what was it that
made you become a vet in the first place? +
Vet: Well, I studied as an ordinary doctor in the beginning, but I slowly realized that I liked
animals very much. I almost prefer animals to people. So I took an extra course in animal
medicine. It's as simple as that really. +
Interviewer: And you still enjoy working with animals? +
Vet: Oh, yes, very much so. In fact, more than ever now. I've got to know animals much
better, you see, and I get on better with them in every way. Their owners sometimes get
on my nerves, though. +
Interviewer: Oh ... why is that? +
Vet: Well, some people know very little about animals and keep them in the wrong
conditions. +
Interviewer: What sort of conditions? +
Vet: Oh, you know, some people buy a large dog and then try to keep it in a small flat; they
don't take it out enough to give it proper exercise. Other people have a cat and try to keep
it in the house all day, but a cat needs to get out and be free to come and go as it pleases. +
A lot of people don't feed their animals properly. It's very common to give pets too much
food which is very bad for them, especially if they're not getting enough exercise. Or not to
feed them regularly, which is equally bad. An animal is a responsibility which is something
many people don't seem to realize. +
Interviewer: You mean people keep pets for the wrong reasons? +
Vet: Yes, some people want a pet because they're lonely, or simply for decoration, or just
to show how rich they are. +
Interviewer: And just how do you deal with these people? +
Vet: Well, I try to tell them what the animal needs, what is the right sort of food, the proper
exercise. I try to teach them that animals are not toys and if they're to be healthy, they
have to be happy. +
Interviewer: Yes, I suppose you're right. In your thirty years as a vet you must have come
across some interesting cases? +
Vet: Oh yes, there are lots of interesting cases. I was once called to a lioness who was
giving birth and having difficulty. Now that was really interesting. +

== Section 2

==== A. Monologue. +

Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, that was our last item, and all that remains for me to
do is to thank our performers sincerely on behalf of us all for the pleasure they have given
us this evening. And of course I must express thanks to those who've worked behind the
scenes. And especially our producer. But most of all I want to say thank you to all of you
for coming here this evening and supporting this event, especially in such weather. I think
perhaps I should take this opportunity to renew my sincere apologies to those sitting in the
back rows. We've made temporary repairs to the roof, but unfortunately the rain tonight
was unexpectedly heavy, and we're grateful to you for your understanding and cheerful
good humor. I may say that we had hoped that temporary repairs would suffice. But we
were recently informed by our surveyor that the whole roof will have to be replaced: which
is of course a severe blow when you think it's only five years since we replaced the roof of
the church itself. And so we shall be having another concert soon, I hope. +

==== B. Wrinkles. +

Manager: Good morning, madam. And what can we do for you? +
Woman: What can you do for me? +
Manager: Yes, madam, what can we do for you? +
Woman: You've already done it, thank you very much. And I want something done about
what you've done for me. +
Manager: Is something the matter, madam? +
Woman: I'll say there is, I want to see the manager. +
Manager: I'm the manager, madam. Now ... now what seems to be the trouble? +
Woman: Look at my face! +
Manager: Your face? Ah yes. Oh dear. Well, never mind. What's wrong with your face? +
What exactly am I supposed to be looking at? +
Woman: My lines, my Wrinkles. +
Manager: Well, we can soon put that right, Madam. You need a bottle of our New +
Generation Wrinkle Cream. With this wonderful new cream your lines and wrinkles just ... +
Woman: Shut up! +
Manager: ... just disap ... I beg your pardon? +
Woman: I said shut up! I was silly enough to listen to you before. I'll listen to no more of it. +
Manager: You say you've been here before, madam. I'm afraid I don't recognize you. +
Woman: Of course you don't recognize me! Last time I came in here I was a very
attractive middle-aged woman. Now I look old enough to be even your grandmother. +
Manager: Well, yes ... er ... some of us do age quicker than others. +
Woman: It's not a question of age, my man, it's a question of your cream. I used it for two
small lines under my eyes and I woke up next morning looking like Lady Frankenstein. +
Your advertisement says 'Lose ten years overnight. For only five pounds you can look
young and attractive again. Tried by thousands. Money back guarantee.' Well, I want
more than my money back. I want you to pay for me to have plastic surgery. +
Manager: But, madam, there must be some mistake. +
Woman: I'll say there's been a mistake. My mistake was believing your advert and buying
your silly cream. 'It can do the same for you, too,' it said. Well, it's certainly done
something for me, but now what it did for the lady in the picture. +
Manager: But our product is tested and approved by doctors. It was thoroughly tested on
thousands of volunteers by experts before it was allowed to be sold on the market. This is
the first complaint we've had. +
Woman: I told you, I want you to pay for a face lift or I'm taking you to court! So there! +
Manager: Er, do you happen to have a ... a recent photograph, madam? +
Woman: What ... whatever do you want with a photograph? You can see the way I look. +
Manager: I mean a photograph of you just before you used the cream. +
Woman: Do you think I go to the photographers everyday? (Pause) Look, Just give me the
five pounds, will you? +
Manager: Do you have your receipt with you, madam? +
Woman: Er ... just a minute ... let me have a look. (Rummages in bag) Er ... no. No, I seem
to have lost it? +
Manager: Then there's nothing I can do, madam. Sorry. +
Woman: (furious) I'll take you to court. I'll take you to court. +
Manager: You can do as you please, madam. Good morning. +

for eating. You know, for ... oh well ... +

they had. +

—But not Sunflower oil. +

oil. +

—That's fine. All right. Well, I suppose I'll have to go out myself again then. +
—Well, sorry, but I don't think it's my fault. +
—Mm. +

==== A. Success and Failure. +

Hugh is on the telephone. Listen to his conversation with Herr Kohler. +
Secretary: I have a call for you on line one, Mr. Gibbs. It's Mandred Kohler in Dusseldorf. +
Hugh: Oh, yes. Put him through. Hello, Herr Kohler. How are you? +
Kohler: Very well, thank you. And you? +
Hugh: Just fine. +
Kohler: Glad to hear it ... uh ... I'll come straight to the point, if you don't mind. I'm sure you
know why I'm phoning. +
Hugh: Yes, of course. About the ... +
Kohler: Exactly. Are you in a position to give us a definite assurance that the goods will be
delivered on time? +
Hugh: Well, um ... you can count on us to do our very best, however ... +
Kohler: Hmm. Excuse me, Mr. Gibbs, but I'm afraid that really isn't good enough ... I beg
your pardon, I don't mean your best isn't good enough, but will you meet the deadline or
won't you? +
Hugh: I ... I was coming to that, Herr Kohler. I must be frank with you. We've run into a few
problems. +
Kohler: Problems? What kind of problems? +
Hugh: Technical problems. Nothing very serious. There's no need to worry. +
Kohler: I hope not, Mr. Gibbs, for your sake as well as ours. I'm sure you're aware that
there's a penalty in your contract with us for late delivery and we'll ... +
Hugh: Yes, Herr Kohler, I'm perfectly aware of that. But do you need the whole order by
the 24th? +
Kohler: We would certainly prefer the whole order to be delivered by then, yes. +
Hugh: Yes, but do you need the whole order then? +
Kohler: What exactly are you suggesting? +
Hugh: You can count on us to get half of the order to you by then. +
Kohler: Hmm ... and how long before the other half is delivered? +
Hugh: Another week at the most! +
Kohler: Hmm ... you're sure that's all? +
Hugh: Yes, absolutely! You can depend on us to get half the order to you by the 24th and
the other half within a week. +
Kohler: Hmm ... yes, that should be all right ... but there must be no further delays! +
Hugh: There won't be! You can count on that. +
Kohler: Very well, Mr. Gibbs. +
Hugh: Thank you! You've been very understanding. +
Kohler: Goodbye, Mr. Gibbs. +
Hugh: Goodbye, Herr Kohler. And thank you again! Phew! Well, ... that's at least one
problem out of the way! +

==== B. Elvis Presley. +

When Elvis Presley died on 16th August, 1977, radio and television programs all over the world were interrupted to give the news of his death. President Carter was asked to declare a day of national mourning. Carter said: 'Elvis Presley changed the face of American popular culture ... He was unique and irreplaceable.' Eighty thousand people attended his funeral. The streets were jammed with cars, and Elvis Presley films were shown on television, and his records were played on the radio all day. In the year after his death, one hundred million Presley LPs were sold.

Elvis Presley was born on January 8th, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi. His twin brother, Jesse Garon, died at birth. His parents were very poor and Elvis never had music lessons, but he was surrounded by music from an early age. His parents were very religious, and Elvis regularly sang at church services. In 1948, when he was thirteen, his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee. He left school in 1953 and got a job as a truck driver.

In the summer of 1953 Elvis paid four dollars and recorded two songs for his mother’s birthday at Sam Phillips' Sun Records studio. Sam Phillips heard Elvis and asked him to record "That’s All Right" in July 1954. Twenty thousand copies were sold, mainly in and around Memphis. He made five more records for Sun, and in July 1955 he met Colonel Tom Parker, who became his manager in November. Parker sold Elvis’s contract to RCA Records. Sun Records got thirty-five thousand dollars and Elvis got five thousand dollars.

With the money he bought a pink Cadillac for his mother. On January 10th, 1956, Elvis recorded "Heartbreak Hotel", and a million copies were sold. In the next fourteen months he made another fourteen records, and they were all big hits. In 1956 he also made his first film in Hollywood.

In March, 1958, Elvis had to join the army. He wanted to be an ordinary soldier. When his hair was cut thousands of women cried. He spent the next two years in Germany, where he met Priscilla Beaulieu, who became his wife eight years later on May 1st, 1967. In 1960 he left the army and went to Hollywood where he made several films during the next few years.

By 1968 many people had become tired of Elvis. He hadn’t performed live since 1960. But he recorded a new LP "From Elvis in Memphis" and appeared in a special television program. He became popular again, and went to Las Vegas, where he was paid seven hundred fifty thousand dollars for four weeks. In 1972 his wife left him, and they were divorced in October, 1973. He died from a heart attack. He had been working too hard, and eating and drinking too much for several years. He left all his money to his only daughter, Lisa Marie Presley. She became one of the richest people in the world when she was only nine years old.
