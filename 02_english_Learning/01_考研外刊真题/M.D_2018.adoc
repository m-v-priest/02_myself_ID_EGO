`主` The first step, *as* Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee *argue*(`=to give reasons why you think that sth is right/wrong, true/not true, etc`) in The Second Machine Age, `系` *should be* rethinking education and job training. ② `主` Curriculums -- *from* grammar school(`=a school for young people between the ages of 11 and 18 who are good at academic subjects`) *to* college -- `谓` *should evolve*(`=to develop gradually, especially from a simple to a more complicated form; to develop sth in this way`) *to focus less on* memorizing facts and *more on* creativity and complex communication. ③ Vocational(`=connected with the skills, knowledge, etc. that you need to have in order to do a particular job`) schools *should do* a better job of *fostering*(`=to encourage sth to develop`) problem-solving skills and *helping* students *work alongside* robots. ④ Online education *can supplement*(`=to add sth to sth in order to improve it or make it more complete`) the traditional kind. ⑤ It *could make* extra training and instruction(`=the act of teaching sth to sb`) 宾补 affordable(`=most people have enough money to buy it`). ⑥ Professionals(n.)(`=a person who does a job that needs special training and a high level of education`) (*trying to acquire* new skills) *will be able to do so* without *going into debt*.

Finally, because automation *threatens to widen* the gap between capital income and labor income, taxes and the safety net *will have to be rethought*(`=to think again about an idea, a course of action, etc., especially in order to change it`). ② Taxes on low-wage labor *need to be cut*, and wage subsidies such as the _earned income tax credit_(`=所得税抵免（EITC）`) *should be expanded*: This *would boost* incomes, *encourage* work, *reward* companies for job creation, and *reduce* inequality.

中产阶级需要面对众多挑战，其中有一项挑战在下一次总统竞选中可能并不会被提及，那就是当机器人可以胜任中产阶级的工作时，会发生什么。 +
不要完全忽略这种可能性。根据牛津大学的一项研究，随着中产阶级被过度压榨，美国约有一半的工作岗位将面临着自动化的危险处境。低收入岗位比如园艺和日间看护不足以吸引机器人。但是许多中产阶级的工作岗位比如运输业、经济咨询、软件开发等行业已经或将引起它们的兴趣。富人们拥有机器人，所以他们不会受到影响。 +
这种情况并非是骇人听闻。乐观主义者指出，过去科技发展的巨变已经惠及许多劳动者。工业革命并没有改变勒德分子的境遇，他们的工作都被机械化的纺织机器取代。但比起它带来的损害，工业革命最终提高了生活标准而且创造了更多的工作岗位。同样地，自动化最终也将通过降低价格，从繁重枯燥的工作中解放劳动者而促进生产，刺激需求。但是在发展中期，中产阶级的劳动者需要进行大量的调整。 +
正如埃里克和安德鲁在《第二次机器时代》里面提到的，首先，中产阶级需要重新思考教育和职业训练。从小学到大学的学校课程应该较少的注重记忆事实，更多的关注创造力和进行复杂交流。职业学校应该更好的培养问题解决技能，帮助学生和机器人一起工作。网络教育可以补充传统教育。网络教育可以额外提供给人们能够负担得起的培训和课程。尝试获得新技能的专业人员会毫不犹豫地选择网络教育。 +
应对自动化的挑战, 凸显出了美国需要复苏本国衰退的经济活力的必要性。创办新公司一定要简单可行。在国内科技发展变化的早期，企业家们通过将劳动者和机器联系在一起从而顺利过渡转型。至今3D打印技术和虚拟现实的最佳使用方法都尚未发现。美国需要发现它们使用方法的新企业。 +
最后，由于自动化的威胁将加大资本收入和劳动收入的差距，税收和安全网不得不重新考虑。低收入劳动者的税收需要削减，工资补贴比如所得税抵免应该扩大。这一举措将增加收入，鼓励工作，奖励公司创造就业机会，减少不平等现象。 +
未来几年，科学技术将通过大大小小各种方式改善社会生活，但是对于那些发现自己的生活和工作将被自动化颠覆的人来讲，这并不会让他们感到舒服。摧毁那些为我们工作的机器是一件疯狂的事情。但是帮助工人适应自动化的政策是不可或缺的。

A new survey(`=an investigation of the opinions, behaviour, etc. of a particular group of people, which is usually done by asking them questions`) by Harvard University *finds* `主` more than two-thirds of young Americans `谓` *disapprove of*(`=to think that sb/sth is not good or suitable; to not approve of sb/sth`) President Trump’s use of Twitter. ② The implication(`=sth that is implied`) *is* that Millennials 千禧一代 *prefer*(`=to choose one thing rather than sth else because you like it better`) news *from* the White House to be filtered 筛选，过滤 through other source, *Not* a president’s social media platform(`=an opportunity or a place for sb to express their opinions publicly or make progress in a particular area`).

====

-> to be filtered through other sources 为后置定语修饰先行词 news。
====

哈佛大学一项新的调查发现， 超过三分之二的美国年轻人不赞同特朗普总统使用推特（Twitter）。言外之意就是千禧之子们更希望信息是从白宫发布,而不是通 过其他途径，不是总统的社交平台。

Most Americans *rely on* social media *to check* daily headlines (尤指报纸头版的) 标题. ② Yet *as* distrust *has risen* toward all media, people may be starting *to beef up*(`=you increase, strengthen, or improve it`) their media literacy(`=the ability to read and write`) skills. ③ Such a trend *is badly(`=used to emphasize how much you want, need, etc. sb/sth`) needed*. 急需的; 这是一种势不可挡的趋势.  ④ During the 2016 presidential campaign, `主` nearly a quarter of web content *shared by* Twitter users (in the politically critical(`=extremely important because a future situation will be affected by it`) state of Michigan) `系` *was* fake news, according to the University of Oxford. ⑤ And `主` a survey *conducted*(`=to organize and/or do a particular activity`) for BuzzFeed News `谓` *found* 44 percent of Facebook users *rarely(`=not very often`) or never trust* news from the media giant.

`主` Young people who are digital natives `谓` *are indeed (用于强调真实性) 确实 becoming* more skillful *at* separating fact from fiction in cyberspace. ② A Knight Foundation 骑士基金会 focus-group survey of young people between ages 14 and 24 *found* they *use* “distributed(`=they exist throughout it`) trust” 分布式信任 *to verify*(`=to check that sth is true or accurate`) stories. ③ They *cross-check*(v.)(`=to make sure that information, figures etc. are correct by using a different method or system to check them 多方(式)核对;交叉检查`) sources /and *prefer*(`=to choose one thing rather than sth else because you like it better`) news *from* different perspectives(`=a particular attitude towards sth; a way of thinking about sth`) -- especially those that *are* open about 对…开放 any bias 偏见;偏向. ④ “Many young people *assume*(`=to take or begin to have power or responsibility`) a great deal of personal responsibility *for* educating themselves and *actively seeking out*(`=to look for and find sb/sth, especially when this means using a lot of effort`) opposing(`=very different from each other`) viewpoints,” the survey *concluded*.

他们反复审视获取的资源，偏向于从不同的视角浏览信息，尤其是那些 带有偏见的新闻。 调查发现“年轻人担负着进行自我教育的责任同时也积极发现 不同的观点”。

Such active research *can have* another effect. ② `主` A 2014 survey *conducted* in Australia, Britain, and the United States by the University of Wisconsin-Madison `谓` *found* that `主` young people’s reliance(n.)(`=the fact that they need it and often cannot live or work without it`) on social media `谓` *led to* greater political engagement.

====

Social media *allows* users *to experience*(`=you feel it or are affected by it`) news events [more intimately(`=having a close and friendly relationship`) and immediately] while also *permitting* them *to re-share* news as a projection(`=the act of projecting it onto a screen or wall; /the act of imagining that sb else is thinking the same as you and is reacting in the same way`) of their values and interests. ② This *forces* users *to be more conscious(a.)(`=aware of sth; noticing sth`) of* their role in passing along(`=forward`) information. ③ A survey by Barna research group *found* `主` the top reason *given by* Americans *for* the fake news phenomenon `系` *is* “reader error,” more so *than* made-up(a.)(`=not true or real; invented`) stories or factual(a.)(`=based on or containing facts`) mistakes in reporting. ④ About a third 约三分之一 *say* the problem of fake news *lies in* "misinterpretation(n.)(`=putting the wrong interpretation on`) or exaggeration(n.)(`=a statement or description that makes sth seem larger, better, worse or more important than it really is; the act of making a statement like this`) of actual news" via social media. ⑤ In other words, the choice *to share news* on social media *may be* the heart of the issue. ⑥ “This *indicates*(`=to show that sth is true or exists`) {there *is* a real personal responsibility in *counteracting*(`=to do sth to reduce or prevent the bad or harmful effects of sth`) this problem},” says Roxanne Stone, editor in chief at Barna Group.

社交媒体不仅可以让用户及时掌握新闻资讯同时也允许用户通过转发分享自己 的观点和兴趣。 这就要求用户在信息传递的过程中更加谨慎。巴尔纳研究组的调 查发现美国人认为虚假新闻现象的首因是“读者误解”而并非是报道中编造的故事或者是事实错误。 +
约有三分之一的用户认为虚假新闻的问题在于通过社交媒体夸大或者是误解了 事实。换句话说，在社交媒体上选择要分享的新闻是这一问题的核心。巴尔纳研 究组的主编 Roxanne Stone 认为， 这表明面对这一问题， 个人需要承担实际责任。

So when young people *are critical(a.)(`=expressing disapproval of sb/sth and saying what you think is bad about them`) of* an over-tweeting president, they *reveal* a mental discipline (in thinking skills -- and in their choices on when *to share* [on social media]).

因此，当年轻人批评一位过度发微博的总统时，他们会在思考技巧和选择何时在社交媒体上分享方面, 表现出一种精神上的自律。

Any fair-minded assessment of the dangers of the deal between Britain's National Health Service (NHS) and DeepMind *must start* by *acknowledging that* both sides *mean well*. ② DeepMind is one of the leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies in the world. ③ `主` The potential of this work *applied to* healthcare `系` *is* very great, but it *could also lead to* further concentration of power in the tech giants. ④ *It Is* against that background *that* `主` the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, `谓` *has issued* her damning verdict *against* the Royal Free Hospital trust under the NHS, which *handed over to* DeepMind the records of 1.6 million patients In 2015 *on the basis of* a vague agreement which *took far too little account of* the patients' rights and their expectations of privacy.

DeepMind *has almost apologized*. The NHS trust *has mended its ways*. ② `主` Further arrangements -- and there may be many -- between the NHS and DeepMind `谓` *will be carefully scrutinised* to ensure that {all necessary permissions *have been asked* (of patients) /and all unnecessary data *has been cleaned*}. ③ There are lessons (about informed patient consent) *to learn*. ④ But privacy *is not* the only angle in this case /and *not even* the most important. ⑤ Ms Denham *chose to concentrate the blame on* the NHS trust, since [under existing law] it “*controlled*” the data /and DeepMind *merely “processed"* it. ⑥ But this distinction *misses the point that* {*it is* processing and aggregation, *not* the mere possession of bits, *that* gives the data value}.

从根本上说，USPS正处于一个历史性的困境:一方面，技术变革永久性地降低了对其主要产品——一流邮件——的需求，另一方面，监管结构剥夺了管理层调整业务以适应新现实的灵活性.

====
- fiscal year : 会计年度；（美）财政年度; 财年

美国邮政署（简写为USPS，美国政府分管邮政的部门，后来部分民营，改为美国邮政总公司，但依旧由美国政府绝对控股，其邮件发送量占世界总量的百分之四十，译注）依旧赤字连连（bleed涂抹，用红墨水涂抹显然是赤字的意思），2016财政年度净亏损高达56亿美元（net loss净亏损，net有一个国内教材上很少提及的意思净得的，最后的），这已经是它连续入不敷出的第十个年头了（straight year习语，到今年连续第几年），它还有额外的1200亿美元的债务没着落（unfunded liabilities没着落债务，专有名词，指无法冲账或平账的开销），主要是医保和养老金。

破产并非不可能（美国与本朝不同，资不抵债即使是政府部门或地方政府一样可以破产）。 可以说，USPS已经站在了十字路口，它必须做一个彻底的变革，坚决降低非盈利支出（bread-and-butter习语，面包和黄油，西方饮食主食经常是抹了黄油的面包，因此代指基本的，基本生存必须的，作为邮局，基本职能就是发送信件，而为了便民服务，这种基本公共开支是不可能盈利的，任何正常运转的国家都是，译注），比如平信（USPS的信件分成几个等级，所谓的“first class”一级邮件是最让初学者犯错的，这就是过去的平信，贴张邮票就可以寄出那种，除此之外，还有priority mail挂号，express mail特快专递，译注），并对组织结构动大手术，正是它一次次让管理层扭转方向的努力付诸流水。（这个句子有点意思，属于从句带从句的复合结构，难点在于between，初学者很容易被习惯思维误导，总认为between后面应该是复数或者and结构，从而把后面那个and认为是和change并列。译注）

各大利益集团，从万国邮政联盟到贺年卡制作商，都在明里暗里地向USPS的幕后大老板 -- 国会 -- 施压，反复强调，USPS是死是活且先不论，他们的利益一分一毫也不准动（意译，直译为他们赖以生存并获得保护的位置维持现状）。这就是近些年多次试图改造USPS却全都无功而返的原因，留给它的只有失意（意译，直译为拖延它的现代化，因为前文已经提到了失败，这里不再重复，译注）和一堆付不起的账单。

立法很快就会在众议院表决通过，再加上另外几张生存措施，USPS将能够在5年内节流286亿美元，这可能有助于买几辆送信的新车。

③ Most of the money *would come from* a penny-per-letter permanent rate increase /and *from* *shifting* postal retirees *into* Medicare(`=the federal insurance system that provides medical care for people over 65 医疗保障制度，老年保健医疗制度`). ④ The latter(a.)(`=being the second of two things, people or groups that have just been mentioned, or the last in a list`) step *would largely offset*(`=to use one cost, payment or situation in order to cancel or reduce the effect of another`) the financial burden(`=a heavy load that is difficult to carry`) of annually 一年一次地 pre-funding 预付保费 retiree 退休人员；退休者 health care, thus *addressing*(`=to think about a problem or a situation and decide how you are going to deal with it 设法解决`) a long-standing complaint by the USPS and its union.

不过即使众议院通过，参议院能否通过也在两可之间，很多参议员认为邮政署只需做最低限度的变革让USPS不翻车就可以了，不必做深层次的变动。（bare minimum最小的，afloat漂浮，转译为翻车；美国参议员任期六年，众议员两年，因此参议员很多想法相对较为长远和稳重，译注）毕竟，合同是死的（直译为集体契约不能更改），不要忘记这个系统百分之八十的支出都是在员工身上。（后半句，直译为该机构支出的八成是在个人账户方面。关键在于personnel员工。八成开销都是员工的工资养老金医疗保险，那么，稍微动一动就可以省下很多钱，译注）只要再在节假日的效率上下点功夫（直译为削减周六邮件分派，可以想象，任谁节假日或快放假了干活效率也不会高，另外需要说明，美国邮局并非七天工作，信件投递是每周六天，译注），很容易就会得到公众认可，外加每年节省二十亿美元开支。不过利益集团们似乎对此不以为然，至少众议院表决时未见相关内容。邮政改革提案的某些共识表明，议员老爷们（legislator立法者）对USPS可能在近期内破产忧心忡忡，对如何让该系统面向未来却视而不见。
