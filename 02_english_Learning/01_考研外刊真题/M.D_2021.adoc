How can Britain's train operators possibly justify yet another increase to rail passenger fares? It has become a grimly reliable annual ritual: every January the cost of travelling by train rises, imposing a significant extra burden on those who have no option but to use the rail network to get to work or otherwise. This year' s rise an average of 2.7 percent, maybe a fraction lower than last year's, but it is still well above the official Consumer Price Index (CPD) measure of inflation.

Successive governments have permitted such increases on the grounds that the cost of investing in and running the rail network should be borne by those who use it, rather than the general taxpayer. Why, the argument goes, should a car-driving pensioner from Lincoln-shire have to subscribe the daily commute of a stockbroker from Surrey? Equally, there is a sense that the travails of commuters in the south East, many of whom will face among the biggest rises, have received too much attention compared to those who must endure the relativity poor infrastructure of the mid lands and the north.

However, over the past 12 months, those commuters have also experienced some of the worst rail strikes in years. It is all very well operators trumpeting the improvements they are making to the network, but passengers should be able to expect a basic level of service for the substantial sums they are now paying to travel. The responsibility for the test wave of strikes rests on the wines. However, there is a strong case that those who have been worst affected by industrial action should receive compensation for the disruption they have suffered.

The Government has pledged to change the law to introduce a minimum service requirement, so that, even when strikes occur services can continue to operate. This should from part of a wider package of measures to address the long-running problems on Britain s railways. Yes, more investment is needed, but passengers will not be willing to pay more indefinitely if they must also endure cramped, unreliable services interrupted by regular chaos when timetables are changed, or planned maintenance is managed incompetently. The threat of nationalization may have been seen off for now, but it will return with a vengeance if the justified anger of passengers is not addressed in short order.



英国的火车运营商如何才能证明, 再次提高铁路客运票价, 是合理的呢?这已经成为一种可怕而可靠的年度惯例:每年一月，乘火车出行的费用都会上涨，这给那些别无选择、只能乘铁路上班, 或其他方式出行的人, 带来了巨大的额外负担。今年的平均增长率为2.7%，可能比去年略低，但仍远高于衡量通货膨胀的官方消费者价格指数(CPD)。

历届政府都允许这样的增长，理由是, 投资和运营铁路网的成本, 应该由使用铁路网的人承担，而不是普通纳税人。争论说，为什么一个从林肯郡来的开车领养老金的人, 要每天去订阅一个从萨里来的股票经纪人的上下班路程呢?同样，有一种感觉是，与那些必须忍受中部和北部相对较差的基础设施的人相比，东南部通勤者的痛苦(他们中的许多人将面临最大的加薪)受到了太多的关注。

然而，在过去的12个月里，这些通勤者也经历了多年来最严重的铁路罢工。运营商鼓吹, 他们对网络的改进是很好的，但乘客们应该能够期待他们现在为旅行支付的大笔费用, 能够得到基本水平的服务。此次罢工风波的责任, 在于葡萄酒。然而，有一个强有力的理由是，那些受劳工行动影响最严重的人, 应该为他们所遭受的破坏获得赔偿。

政府承诺修改法律，引入最低服务要求，这样即使发生罢工，服务也能继续运行。这应该是解决英国铁路长期存在的问题的一揽子措施的一部分。是的，这需要更多的投资，但如果乘客还必须忍受拥挤、不可靠的服务，因为时刻表改变或计划的维护管理不当而中断，他们就不愿意无限期地支付更多的钱。国有化的威胁可能暂时被消除了，但如果乘客的正当愤怒不能在短时间内得到解决，它将卷土重来。

Last year marked the third year in a row of that Indonesia’s bleak rate of deforestation has slowed in pace. One reason for the turnaround may be the country’s antipoverty program.

In 2007, Indonesia started phasing in a program that gives money to its poorest residents under certain conditions, such as requiring people to keep kids in school or get regular medical care. Called conditional cash transfers or CCTs, these social assistance programs are designed to reduce inequality and break the cycle of poverty. They’re already used in dozens of countries worldwide. In Indonesia, the program has provided enough food and medicine to substantially reduce severe growth problems among children.

But CCT programs don’t generally consider effects on the environment. In fact, poverty alleviation and environmental protection are often viewed as conflicting goals, says Paul Ferraro, an economist at Johns Hopkins University.

That’s because economic growth can be correlated with environmental degradation, while protecting the environment is sometimes correlated with greater poverty. However, those correlations don’t prove cause and effect. The only previous study analyzing causality, based on an area in Mexico that had instituted CCTs, supported the traditional view. There, as people got more money, some of them may have more cleared land for cattle to raise for meat, Ferraro says.

Such programs do not have to negatively affect the environment, though. Ferraro wanted to see if Indonesia’s poverty-alleviation program was affecting deforestation. Indonesia has the third-largest area of tropical forest in the world and one of the highest deforestation rates.

Ferraro analyzed satellite data showing annual forest loss from 2008 to 2012 — including during Indonesia’s phase — in of the antipoverty program — in 7,468 forested villages across 15 provinces and multiple islands. The duo separated the effects of the CCT program on forest loss from other factors, like weather and macroeconomic changes, which were also affecting forest loss. With that, “we see that the program is associated with a 30 percent reduction in deforestation,” Ferraro says.

That’s likely because the rural poor are using the money as makeshift insurance policies against inclement weather, Ferraro says. Typically, if rains are delayed, people may clear land to plant more rice to supplement their harvests. With the CCTs, individuals instead can use the money to supplement their harvests.

Whether this research translates elsewhere is anybody’s guess. Ferraro suggests the importance of growing rice and market access. And regardless of transferability, the study shows that what’s good for people may also be good for the value of the avoided deforestation just for carbon dioxide emissions alone is more than the program costs.



去年是印尼森林砍伐速度连续第三年放缓。这种转变的原因之一可能是该国的反贫困项目。
2007年，印尼开始逐步实施一项计划，在某些条件下向最贫困的居民提供资金，比如要求人们让孩子继续上学或获得常规医疗保健。这些社会援助项目被称为有条件现金转移支付(cct)，旨在减少不平等，打破贫困循环。它们已经在全球几十个国家使用。在印度尼西亚，该项目提供了足够的食物和药品，大大减少了儿童严重的生长问题。
但有条件现金援助项目通常不考虑对环境的影响。约翰霍普金斯大学(Johns Hopkins University)经济学家保罗·费拉罗(Paul Ferraro)说，事实上，扶贫和环境保护常常被视为相互矛盾的目标。
这是因为经济增长可能与环境退化有关，而保护环境有时与更严重的贫困有关。然而，这些相关性并不能证明因果关系。之前唯一一项分析因果关系的研究，基于墨西哥一个设立有条件现金转移支付的地区，支持传统观点。费拉罗说，在那里，随着人们得到更多的钱，他们中的一些人可能会有更多的空地供养牛食用。
不过，这些项目不一定会对环境产生负面影响。费拉罗想看看印尼的扶贫项目是否影响了森林砍伐。印度尼西亚拥有世界上第三大热带森林地区，也是毁林率最高的国家之一。
费拉罗分析了卫星数据，这些数据显示了从2008年到2012年，印尼在15个省和多个岛屿上的7468个有森林覆盖的村庄每年的森林损失，其中包括在逐步实施扶贫计划期间。两人将有条件现金援助计划对森林损失的影响与天气和宏观经济变化等也会影响森林损失的其他因素区分开来。费拉罗说，“我们看到，该项目与减少30%的森林砍伐有关。”
费拉罗说，这可能是因为农村的穷人把这笔钱用作应对恶劣天气的权宜之计。通常情况下，如果降雨推迟，人们可能会清理土地种植更多的水稻以补充收成。有了有条件现金援助，个人可以用这些钱来补充收成。
这项研究是否适用于其他地方，谁也说不准。费拉罗提出了种植水稻和市场准入的重要性。不管可转移性如何，这项研究表明，对人们有益的东西可能也有利于避免森林砍伐的价值，因为仅二氧化碳排放量就超过了项目的成本。

As a historian who’s always searching for the text or the image that makes us re-evaluate the past, I’ve become preoccupied with looking for photographs that show our Victorian ancestors smiling (what better way to shatter the image of 19th-century prudery?). I’ve found quite a few, and — since I started posting them on Twitter — they have been causing quite a stir. People have been surprised to see evidence that Victorians had fun and could, and did, laugh. They are noting that the Victorians suddenly seem to become more human as the hundred-or-so years that separate us fade away through our common experience of laughter.

Of course, I need to concede that my collection of ‘Smiling Victorians’ makes up only a tiny percentage of the vast catalogue of photographic portraiture created between 1840 and 1900, the majority of which show sitters posing miserably and stiffly in front of painted backdrops, or staring absently into the middle distance. How do we explain this trend?

During the 1840s and 1850s, in the early days of photography, exposure times were notoriously long: the daguerreotype photographic method (producing an image on a silvered copper plate) could take several minutes to complete, resulting in blurred images as sitters shifted position or adjusted their limbs. The thought of holding a fixed grin as the camera performed its magical duties was too much to contemplate, and so a non-committal blank stare became the norm.

But exposure times were much quicker by the 1880s, and the introduction of the Box Brownie and other portable cameras meant that, though slow by today’s digital standards, the exposure was almost instantaneous. Spontaneous smiles were relatively easy to capture by the 1890s, so we must look elsewhere for an explanation of why Victorians still hesitated to smile.

One explanation might be the loss of dignity displayed through a cheesy grin. “Nature gave us lips to conceal our teeth,” ran one popular Victorian saying, alluding to the fact that before the birth of proper dentistry, mouths were often in a shocking state of hygiene. A flashing set of healthy and clean, regular ‘pearly whites’ was a rare sight in Victorian society, the preserve of the super-rich (and even then, dental hygiene was not guaranteed).

A toothy grin (especially when there were gaps or blackened teeth) lacked class: drunks, tramps, and music hall performers might gurn and grin with a smile as wide as Lewis Carroll’s gum-exposing Cheshire Cat, but it was not a becoming look for properly bred persons. Even Mark Twain, a man who enjoyed a hearty laugh, said that when it came to photographic portraits there could be “nothing more damning than a silly, foolish smile fixed forever”.


作为一名历史学家，我总是在寻找能让我们重新评估过去的文本或图像，我一直在全神贯注地寻找那些展现我们维多利亚时代祖先微笑的照片(还有什么更好的方法来打破19世纪假正经的形象呢?)我已经找到了不少，而且——自从我开始在Twitter上发布它们——它们已经引起了相当大的轰动。人们惊讶地发现，维多利亚时代的人很开心，也能笑，而且确实笑了。他们注意到，维多利亚时代的人突然变得更有人情味了，因为在过去的一百多年里，我们之间的隔阂随着共同的笑的经历而消失了。
当然,我必须承认,我的微笑的维多利亚时代的只占很小比例的庞大的摄影肖像画目录创建在1840年至1900年之间,其中大部分痛苦地展示模特摆姿势,僵硬地画背景,或者心不在焉地望向中间的距离。我们如何解释这种趋势?
在19世纪40年代和50年代，在摄影的早期，曝光时间是出了名的长:银版照相法(在镀银的铜板上产生图像)可能需要几分钟才能完成，因为坐着的人会移动位置或调整他们的四肢，导致图像模糊不清。当摄像机完成它神奇的任务时，要保持一个固定的笑容，这是太多的凝视，所以一个不确定的空白的凝视成为了常态。
但到了19世纪80年代，曝光时间要快得多，而且Box Brownie和其他便携式相机的推出意味着，尽管以今天的数字标准来看，曝光速度很慢，但几乎是瞬间曝光。到19世纪90年代，自发的微笑相对容易捕捉，所以我们必须从其他地方寻找为什么维多利亚时代的人仍然不愿微笑的解释。
一种解释可能是一种失去尊严的笑容。“大自然给了我们嘴唇来掩盖我们的牙齿，”维多利亚时代的一句流行格言这样说，暗指在正规的牙医诞生之前，口腔的卫生状况常常令人震惊。在维多利亚时代，一套健康、干净、整齐的“珍珠白”牙齿是罕见的，那是超级富豪的专属(即使在那个时候，也不能保证牙齿卫生)。
露齿而笑(尤其是牙齿有缝隙或变黑的时候)缺乏品位:酒鬼、流浪汉和音乐大厅的表演者可能会笑得像刘易斯·卡罗尔画的露口香糖的柴郡猫那样咧着嘴笑，但这对受过良好教养的人来说并不合适。就连喜欢开怀大笑的马克·吐温(Mark Twain)也说过，当谈到肖像摄影时，“没有什么比一个愚蠢、愚蠢的永远固定的微笑更可恶了”。

From the early days of broadband, advocates for consumers and web-based companies worried that the cable and phone companies selling broadband connections had the power and incentive to favor affiliated websites over their rivals. That’s why there has been such a strong demand for rules that would prevent broadband providers from picking winners and losers online, preserving the freedom and innovation that have been the lifeblood of the internet.

Yet that demand has been almost impossible to fill—in part because of pushback from broadband providers, anti-regulatory conservatives and the courts. A federal appeals court weighed in again Tuesday, but instead of providing a badly needed resolution, it only prolonged the fight. At issue before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was the latest take of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on net neutrality, adopted on a party-line vote in 2017. The Republican-penned order not only eliminated the strict net neutrality rules the FCC had adopted when it had a Democratic majority in 2015, but rejected the commission’s authority to require broadband providers to do much of anything. The order also declared that state and local governments couldn’t regulate broadband providers either.

The commission argued that other agencies would protect against anti-competitive behavior, such as a broadband-providing conglomerate like AT&T favoring its own video-streaming service at the expense of Netflix and Apple TV. Yet the FCC also ended the investigations of broadband providers that imposed data caps on their rivals’ streaming services but not their own.

On Tuesday, the appeals court unanimously upheld the 2017 order deregulating broadband providers, citing a Supreme Court ruling from 2005 that upheld a similarly deregulatory move. But Judge Patricia Millett rightly argued in a concurring opinion that “the result is unhinged from the realities of modern broadband service,” and said Congress or the Supreme Court could intervene to “avoid trapping Internet regulation in technological anachronism.”

In the meantime, the court threw out the FCC’s attempt to block all state rules on net neutrality, while preserving the commission’s power to preempt individual state laws that undermine its order. That means more battles like the one now going on between the Justice Department and California, which enacted a tough net neutrality law in the wake of the FCC’s abdication.

The endless legal battles and back-and-forth at the FCC cry out for Congress to act. It needs to give the commission explicit authority once and for all to bar broadband providers from meddling in the traffic on their network and to create clear rules protecting openness and innovation online.

从宽带出现的早期开始，消费者和网络公司的支持者就担心，出售宽带连接的有线电视和电话公司有权力和动机偏向附属网站，而不是竞争对手。这就是为什么人们强烈要求制定规则，防止宽带提供商在网上挑选赢家和输家，以保护互联网的命脉——自由和创新。
然而，由于宽带提供商、反监管保守派和法院的阻挠，这一需求几乎不可能得到满足。周二，一家联邦上诉法院再次介入，但它没有提供急需的解决方案，只是延长了这场争斗。美国哥伦比亚特区巡回上诉法院(U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit)面临的问题是联邦通信委员会(FCC)在2017年基于党派立场投票通过的网络中立性的最新举措。这项由共和党人起草的命令不仅取消了联邦通信委员会在2015年民主党占多数时采用的严格的网络中立规则，而且拒绝了委员会要求宽带提供商做任何事情的权力。该命令还宣布，州和地方政府也不能监管宽带提供商。
该委员会认为，其他机构将保护自己不受反竞争行为的影响，比如提供宽带服务的企业集团，如美国电话电报公司(AT&T)，以牺牲Netflix和苹果电视(Apple TV)为代价，支持自己的视频流媒体服务。然而，FCC也结束了对宽带提供商的调查，这些提供商对其竞争对手的流媒体服务施加数据上限，而不是对自己的流媒体服务。
周二，上诉法院一致支持2017年放松对宽带提供商监管的命令，援引了最高法院2005年的一项裁决，该裁决支持类似的放松监管举措。但法官帕特里夏·米莱特(Patricia Millett)在一份一致的意见中正确地指出，“结果脱离了现代宽带服务的现实”，并表示国会或最高法院可以进行干预，“避免互联网监管陷入技术过时的陷阱”。
与此同时，法院驳回了FCC试图阻止所有州关于网络中立性的规定的企图，同时保留了该委员会在破坏其秩序的个别州法律面前先发制人的权力。这意味着会有更多类似于司法部和加州之间的争斗，加州在联邦通信委员会(FCC)退出后颁布了一项严格的网络中立法。
没完没了的法律斗争和联邦通信委员会的反反复复迫切要求国会采取行动。它需要给予委员会明确的权力，一劳永逸地禁止宽带提供商干预其网络的流量，并制定明确的规则，保护网络的开放性和创新性。
