{The decision of the New York Philharmonic 交响乐团,爱音乐的人 *to hire* Alan Gilbert *as* its next music director} *has been* the talk(`=a conversation or discussion`) of the classical-music world [ever since the sudden announcement of his appointment in 2009].  +
For the most part 在极大程度上，多半, the response *has been* favorable(a.)(`=agree with it and approve of it`), to say the least 退一步说,最起码. “Hooray 好哇，好极了，万岁! At last!” *wrote* Anthony Tommasini, a sober(`=serious and thoughtful`)-sided 有…面的 classical-music critic.
====
- philharmonic => phil，philo(爱)+harmonic(音乐的，和声的)=爱好音乐的
- sober => so(少)+beer(啤酒)=sober，喝很少的啤酒，是＂未醉的、清醒的＂。 
====
纽约爱乐乐团决定聘请Alan Gilbert作为下一任的音乐总监，这从2009年任命被宣布之日起就在古典音乐界引起了热议。别的不说，大部分人的反应是积极的。“好啊，终于好了！” Anthony Tommasini写道，他可是一个以严肃著称的古典音乐评论家。

One of the reasons why the appointment *came as* such a surprise, however, *is* that 表Gilbert is comparatively 对比地；相对地 little known.  +
Even 主 Tommasini, who *had advocated*(`=to support sth publicly`) Gilbert’s appointment in the Times, 谓 *calls* him “an unpretentious(`=not trying to appear more special, intelligent, important, etc. than you really are`) musician with no air 样子,神态,姿态 of the formidable(`=you feel slightly frightened by them because they are very great or impressive`)敬畏的 conductor (乐队)指挥 about him.” 

*As* a description of the next music director of an orchestra 管弦乐队 (that *has [hitherto(ad.)(`=until now; until the particular time you are talking about`)] been led by* musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez), that seems likely *to have struck*(`=gives you the impression of`) at least some Times readers *as* faint(`=very small; possible but unlikely`) praise.
====
- unpretentious (a.)谦虚谨慎的；不事张扬的；不爱炫耀的 => tend,tent,tens =stretch,表示"伸展" 说明:pre提前+tens+ious→提前摆出一种姿态→自负
- If something *strikes* you *as* being a particular thing, *it gives you the impression of being that thing*. 给…印象;让…觉得 +
-> *He struck me as* a very serious but friendly person.  他在我眼里是个非常严肃但友好的人。
====

但是，这个任命之所以引起人们惊讶的原因，却是Gilbert相对而言并不是很有名。甚至在时代杂志上发文支持Gilbert任命的Tommasini都称其为：低调的音乐家，在他身上找不到那种飞扬跋扈的指挥家的气质。 +
纽约爱乐乐团迄今为止都是由像Gustav Mahler(古斯塔夫·马勒)和Pierre Boulez布列兹那样的音乐家领导的。这样去描述这个乐团的下一位指挥，至少对于时代的读者而言，这是一种苍白的表扬(明褒暗贬?)。 

For my part 就我而言，对我来说, I have no idea {whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good one}. To be sure, he *performs* an impressive(`=making you feel admiration, because they are very large, good, skilful, etc`) variety of interesting compositions 创作,写作,作曲, but it is not necessary for me *to visit* Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, *to hear* interesting orchestral 管弦乐队的 music. All I have to do *is* to go to my CD shelf, or *boot up* 启动(计算机) my computer and *download* still more recorded 录制 music from iTunes.

就我看来，我不知道Gilbert是否是一个伟大的指挥家或者是一个好的指挥。但是我能确定的是，他能表现出很多有趣的乐章，但是我却应该不会去Avery Fisher Hall或者其他地方，去听一场有趣的交响乐演出。我要做的事情就是去我的CD架上，或者打开的我的电脑，从ITUNES上下载更多的唱片。 

Devoted(`=having great love for sb/sth and being loyal to them`) concertgoers(`=someone who goes to concerts regularly`) (who *reply* that {recordings *are no* substitute 代替物;代用品 *for* live 现场直播的 performance}) *are missing*(`=to fail to understand sth`) the point 要点；核心问题. 

For the time, attention, and money of the art-loving 爱好艺术的 public, classical instrumentalists 乐器演奏者 *must compete 竞争 not only with* opera houses, dance troupes(`=a group of actors, singers, etc. who work together`), theater companies, and museums, *but also with* the recorded performances of the great classical musicians of the 20th century.  

There recordings 唱片；录音带；录像带 *are* cheap, available everywhere, and very [often] *much higher* [in artistic 艺术的 quality] *than* today’s live performances; moreover 再者;此外, they can *be “consumed(`=to use sth, especially fuel, energy or time`)”* at a time and place of the listener’s choosing.  

The widespread(`=existing or happening over a large area or among many people`) availability 可得到的东西(或人);可得性 of such recordings *has thus brought about* 带来，引起 a crisis(`=a time of great danger, difficulty or confusion`) in the institution of the traditional classical concert.

那些忠实的音乐会观众会讲，唱片并不能代替现场的演出，但是他们忽略了一些事情。当下为了获得艺术爱好者的钱，时间，关注度，古典音乐的演奏家们(其实就是指交响乐团，同意复述)不仅要和剧院，舞蹈队，演出公司和博物馆竞争，而且还需要和那些记录了20世纪的伟大的古典音乐演奏者表演的唱片竞争。 +
唱片很便宜，那里都能买到，并且比现在很多现场音乐会的艺术质量要高。进一步的讲，听众能选择听唱片的时间和地点。这些到处可以获得的唱片，给传统的演出机构带来了危机。

One possible response *is* [for classical performers] *to program* 为…安排节目 attractive new music (that *is not* yet available on record).  +
Gilbert’s own interest in new music *has been widely noted* : Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, *has described* him *as* a man who is capable of *turning* the Philharmonic 交响乐团 *into* “a markedly(`=easy to see`) different, more vibrant(`=full of life and energy`) organization.”  +
But what *will be* the nature(`=the basic qualities of a thing`) of that difference? 主 Merely *expanding* the orchestra’s 管弦乐队 repertoire (一个演员所能表演的)全部节目，曲目 谓 *will not be* enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first *change* the relationship between America’s oldest orchestra and the new audience (it *hops*(`=to move by jumping with all or both feet together`) to attract).
====
- Philharmonic => *phil-,爱，harmonic,谐音，和声*，词源同harmony,引申词义音乐。
- orchestra => 来自拉丁语orchestra,管弦乐，来自希腊语erkhesthai,起来，起舞，*来自PIE ergh,升起，上升，词源同origin,orient.比喻用法。*
- repertoire => 源于：repertory(n 仓库)，剧目的仓库－全部剧目。repeat 重复，repert(联想重复repeat),重复地表演，直到演完所有节目
====
对于古典音乐演奏者而言，他们可能的一个回应就是排练出唱片上没有的曲目。Gilbert对新音乐兴趣已经被广泛的关注了：Alex Ross，一名古典音乐的批评家，就这样描述道：他能够把爱乐乐团变成一个完全不同，更加有活力的组织。但是那种不同的性质也是什么呢？可能仅仅增加乐团演出的曲目是不够的，如果Gilbert和他的乐团要进步的话，他们就必须首先改变美国最古老的乐团(就是纽约爱乐乐团)同他们想吸引的新观众间的关系。

When Liam McGee *departed*(`=to leave your job`) as president of Bank of America in August, his explanation *was* surprisingly straight up 直率地；真实地. Rather than *cloaking*(`=to cover or hide sth`) his exit [in the usual vague(`=not having or giving enough information or details about sth`) excuses 借口，理由], he *came right out* 直接，坦率地 and *said* {he *was leaving* “*to pursue* my goal of running a company.”} *Broadcasting*(`=to tell a lot of people about sth`) {his ambition *was* “very much my decision,”} McGee says.  

当八月份，Liam McGee以总裁的身份从美国银行离职的时候，他的解释出人意料的直白。他没有忸怩的用平常的模糊的理由来遮掩他的离开，他很坦诚的讲他离开就是为了去追求他经营一家公司的目标。McGee说宣扬自己的目标就是自己的决定。 

Within two weeks, he *was talking* for the first time *with* the board 董事会 of Hartford Financial Services Group, which *named*(`=to choose sb for a job or position`) him CEO and chairman on September 29.

两周后，他第一次和Hartford Financial Services Group的董事会第一次会谈，这家公司在9月29日提名他为董事会主席和CEO。

McGee *says* ｛主 leaving [without a position lined up 排队, 使排成一行] 谓 *gave* him time *to reflect on*(`=to think carefully and deeply about sth`) what kind of company he wanted to run｝. It also *sent* a clear message *to* the outside world about his aspirations(`=a strong desire to have or do sth`).  
====
- *aspiration* : [ Cusually pl.U ] *~ (for sth) /~ (to do sth)* : a strong desire to have or do sth 渴望；抱负；志向 +
=> spir=breathe,表示"呼吸"。 +
-> I didn't realize *you had political aspirations*. 我没有意识到你有政治上的抱负。
====

他说, 在离开的时候并没有找好后面的职位(下家)，使他有时间去反思他到底想去经营一家什么样的公司。这同时也就他的激情和决心，给了外界一个清晰的信号。

And McGee isn’t alone. [In recent weeks] the No.2 executives (at Avon and American Express) *quit*(`=to leave your job, school, etc`) with the explanation that {they *were looking for* a CEO post(`=a job, especially an important one in a large organization`)}. 

As boards 董事会 *scrutinize*(`=to look at or examine sb/sth carefully`) succession(`=a number of`) plans *in response to* shareholder pressure, 主 executives (who don’t *get* the nod 点头;点头赞同) 谓 also *may wish* to move on(`=finish or stop one activity and start doing something different`).  +
主 A turbulent(`=one in which there is a lot of change, confusion, and disorder`) business environment 谓 also *has* 使处于(某状态)；使作出(某种反应) senior(`=high in rank or status`) managers 宾补 cautious(a.)(`=being careful about`) of {*letting* vague(`=not having or giving enough information or details about sth`) pronouncements *cloud*(`=to fill with clouds`) their reputations}. 
====
- have :*to cause sb/sth to be in a particular state; to make sb react in a particular way* 使处于(某状态)；使作出(某种反应) +
-> I want to *have everything ready [in good time]*. 我要求一切都得准时备妥。 +
-> He *had his audience listening attentively*. 他抓住了听众的注意力。
====


这样做的并不只是McGee一个人。最近几周，Avon and American Express的一些高级经理离职，并解释说想需找一个ceo的职位。 +
当董事会迫于股东的压力对一系列的计划进行审查的时候，那些计划被否定掉的经理们也会想离开。激烈的商业环境同样使得高级经理很小心，模糊的表态可能会破坏他们的声誉。

As the first signs of recovery *begin to take hold*(`=to begin to have complete control over sb/sth; to become very strong`), deputy 副职;副手;副主管 chiefs *may be* more willing *to make the jump* without a net.  +
In the third quarter, CEO turnover(`=the rate at which employees leave a company and are replaced by other people`) *was down* 23% from a year ago [原因状as nervous boards *stuck with*(`=to stay close to sb so that they can help you`) the leaders (they had)], according to Liberum Research.  +
As the economy *picks up* (跌倒或被击倒后)使(自己)慢慢站起(或爬起), opportunities *will abound*(`=to exist in great numbers or quantities`) for aspiring(`=wanting to be successful in life`) leaders.
====
- *take (a) hold* : to begin to have complete control over sb/sth; to become very strong 开始完全控制；变得十分强大 +
-> Panic *took hold of him* and he couldn't move. 他突然惊慌得动弹不得。
- aspire => 前缀a-同ad-. 词根spir, 呼吸, 见inspire, 吸入，启迪。
====


当经济复苏的标志开始确定的时候，二把手们可能更愿意在没有网(新的工作)情况下换工作。第三季度，根据Liberum的调查，CEO的更迭和一年前相比减少了23%，这是由于紧张的董事会紧盯着他们的ceo们。随着经济的复苏和好转，对有理想的头儿们，机会是很多的。

The decision (*to quit* a senior position *to look for* a better one) *is* unconventional(`=not the usual way of doing it`). For years多年来 executives and headhunters 猎头 *have adhered(`=to follow a particular set of beliefs or a fixed way of doing sth`) to* the rule that the most attractive CEO candidates *are* the ones who *must be poached* (侵入他人地界)偷猎，偷捕;挖人.  +
Says Korn/Ferry senior partner Dennis Carey:”I *can’t think of* a single search (I’ve done) where a board *has not instructed*(`=to formally tell sb to do sth`) me *to look at* sitting (总统或议员)现任的，在任期内的 CEOs first.”

离开高管的职位去寻找一个更好的职位，并不是传统的做法。多年以来，经理们和猎头们都认同这样一个原则：最有吸引力的CEO的竞争是那些需要去挖来的人。Korn Ferry， senior partner Dennis Carey说道：我所做的每一次的招聘中，董事会都要求我从那些在任的CEO中寻找人选。

Those (who *jumped* without a job) *haven’t always landed in* top positions quickly. Ellen Marram *quit as* chief of Tropicana [a decade age], *saying* she wanted to be a CEO. It was a year before she *became* head of a tiny Internet-based 基于互联网的 commodities exchange 商品交易所.   +
Robert Willumstad *left* Citigroup in 2005 with ambitions to be a CEO. He finally *took that post* at a major financial institution three years later.
====
- exchange : ( often *Exchange* ) [ C ] ( in compounds 构成复合词 ) a building where business people met [in the past] to buy and sell a particular type of goods 交易所
====
那些没有找到工作就离开的人，并不是很快就能找到顶级的职位。10年前，Tropicana被PepsiCo (PEP)收购了，她以经理的身份离职了，她说他想当ceo。但是花了一年的时间她才成为一家小型互联网交换公司的头。2005年Robert Willumstad带着想成为CEO的梦想离开了Citigroup。可是三年后他才成为了一家主要的金融机构的CEO。

Many recruiters 招聘人员，征兵人员 *say* the old disgrace *is fading*(`=to disappear gradually`) for top performers. The financial crisis *has made* it more acceptable *to be* between jobs 待业中;失业 or *to leave* a bad one.  +
“The traditional rule *was* it’s safer *to stay* where you are, but that’s *been fundamentally(`=completely`) inverted*(`=to change the normal position of sth, especially by turning it upside down`),” says one headhunter. “The people (who’*ve been hurt* the worst) *are* those who’*ve stayed* too long.”

很多招聘的人都说对于高管而言，过去认为的丢脸的感觉(没有工作)已经慢慢消失了。金融危机已经使得跳槽，离开一个不好的工作变得更加可以接受了。一个猎头就说到： “传统的规则是，待在你原来的地方会更加安全，但是现在已经彻底改变了。那些受伤最厉害的，就是那里在一个地方待太久的人。”

The rough(`=not exact; not including all details`) guide to marketing success *used to be* that {you got what you paid for}. No longer. While traditional “paid” media ——such as television commercials(`=an advertisement that is broadcast on television or radio`) and print advertisements —— still *play a major role*, companies today *can exploit*(`=to use sth well in order to gain`) many alternative forms of media.  

过去，市场营销的成功诀窍简而言之就是一分钱一分货。然而时过境迁。虽然传统的“付费”(paid)媒介，比如电视和广播广告、平面广告和路边广告牌等，仍然扮演着重要角色，但企业如今还可以利用许多其他形式的媒介。

Consumers (*passionate*(`=having or showing strong feelings of enthusiasm for sth`) about a product) *may create* “owned” media by *sending* e-mail alerts about products /and *sales to* customers (*registered with* its Web site).  +
主 The way (consumers now *approach*(`=to come near to sb/sth in distance or time` the process of making purchase decisions) 谓 *means* that {marketing’s impact *stems from* a broad(`=wide`) range of factors [*beyond* conventional paid media]}.


比如，痴迷于某种产品的消费者，可能会乐意将之推荐给朋友，从而为企业创造因产品的优良品质带来的“无偿”(earned)媒介。企业还可以利用“自有”(owned)媒介，通过邮件向其网站的注册用户发送产品和销售提示。 +
目前，消费者做出购买决定的方式, 意味着市场营销的影响力来源于一些广泛的因素，这些因素已经超出了传统的付费媒体.

Paid and owned media *are controlled by* marketers 商人 (*promoting* 促销；推广 their own products). For earned media , such marketers *act as* the initiator(`=the person who starts sth`) for users’ responses. But in some cases, one marketer’s owned media become another marketer’s paid media —— for instance, when an e-commerce 商业;贸易 retailer 零售商;零售店 *sells* ad space [on its Web site]. We *define* such sold media *as* owned media whose traffic(`=the movement of people or goods from one place to another`)信息流量 *is* so strong that other organizations *place* their content or e-commerce engines within that environment.  
====
- *Owned media* is when you leverage(`=to use borrowed money in order to buy it or pay for it`)举债经营 a channel (you create and control).  This could be your company blog, YouTube channel, your website, or even your Facebook page.  Even though you don’t strictly 严格地；完全地；确实地 “own’ your YouTube channel or your Facebook page, you do control them and don’t have to pay for basic usage.

- *Earned media* is when customers, the press and the public share your content, speak about谈及 your brand 商标,牌子 via word of mouth, and otherwise discuss your brand.  In other words, the mentions are “earned,” meaning they are voluntarily 志愿地 given by others.

- *Paid media* is when you pay to leverage a third-party channel, such as sponsorships 资助(金);赞助(金);资金支持 and advertising on third-party sites.

====

营销人员通过付费和自有媒介推销其产品，而在“无偿”媒介方面，营销人员就像是触发用户响应的初始催化剂。在某些情况下，某营销者的自有媒介，会成为另一个营销者的付费媒介。比如，当某电子商务零售商出售其网站的广告空间时，我们就将这种“售出”媒介定义为拥有巨大流量、以致其他机构纷纷前来投放内容或电子商务引擎的自有媒介。

This trend , which we believe *is* still in its infancy(`=the time when a child is a baby or very young`), effectively 其实;实际上 *began with* retailers 零售商;零售店 and travel providers *such as* airlines and hotels and *will [no doubt] go further*. 

Johnson & Johnson, for example, *has created* BabyCenter, a stand-alone(`=able to be operated on its own without being connected to a larger system`) media property(`=a possession or possessions`) that *promotes*(`=to help sell a product, service`) complementary 互补的 and even competitive products. 

[Besides *generating*(`=to produce or create sth`) income], the presence 出席；参加 of other marketers ① *makes* the site *seem* objective 客观的; 不带偏见的, ② *gives* companies opportunities *to learn* valuable information about the appeal(`=a quality that makes sb/sth attractive or interesting`) of other companies’ marketing 市场营销;营销, ③ and may help *expand* user traffic *for* all companies (concerned).

我们认为，这种趋势已蓬勃发端于零售商和航空、酒店等旅游供应商，虽然还处于初始阶段，但无疑可以走得更远。比如，强生公司创建了著名网站BabyCenter，借以推广互补性乃至竞争性产品，而其他营销者的出现不仅带来了收入，还令该网站看起来公正客观，并且使企业有机会从其他公司的营销活动中获得可贵的信息，最后还有助于扩大所有相关企业的用户流量。 +
(展示其他营销者的产品信息, 除了可以带来收入，也能使该网站看起来公正客观，并使企业有机会得到宝贵信息，了解其他公司市场营销方式的吸引力，还有可能增加所有相关企业的用户流量。)

The same dramatic(`=sudden, very great and often surprising`) technological changes (that *have provided* marketers *with* more and more diverse(a.)(`=very different from each other and of various kinds`) communications choices) *have also increased* the risk that passionate consumers *will voice*(`=to tell people your feelings or opinions about sth`) their opinions [in quicker, more visible, and much more damaging ways]. 

Such hijacked media *are* the opposite 对立面 of earned media: an asset 资产；财产 or campaign  *becomes* hostage 人质 to consumers, other stakeholders, or activists 积极分子；活跃分子 (who *make* negative(`=unpleasant, depressing, or harmful`) allegations(`=a public statement that is made without giving proof, accusing sb of doing sth that is wrong or illegal`) about a brand or product).  

剧烈的技术变革, 使营销人员获得了数量更多、种类更广的沟通选择，但同时也带来了更高的风险，因为激动的消费者能够以更迅速、更明显、更有害的方式来表达他们的意见。这就是与“无偿”媒介相对的“劫持”媒介：某项资产或活动, 变成了对某个品牌或产品不满的消费者、其他股东或积极分子的劫持物。

Members of social networks, for instance, *are learning* that {they *can hijack* media *to apply* pressure *on* the businesses (that originally created them)}.

If that *happens*, passionate consumers *would try to persuade* others *to boycott*(`=to refuse to buy, use or take part in sth as a way of protesting`) products, *putting* the reputation of the target company *at risk*. In such a case, the company’s response *may not be* sufficiently quick or thoughtful(`=showing signs of careful thought`), and the learning curve 学习曲线 *has been* steep(`=rising or falling quickly, not gradually`). 

Toyota Motor, for example, *alleviated*(`=make it less intense or severe`) some of the damage *from* its recall crisis [earlier this year] *with* a relatively quick and well-orchestrated(`=to organize a complicated plan or event very carefully or secretly`) social-media response campaign, which *included* efforts *to engage with*(`=to become involved with and try to understand sth/sb`) consumers [directly] *on* sites such as Twitter and the social-news site Digg.

比如，社交网络用户正领悟到，他们可以通过“劫持”媒介,来对最初创建该媒介的企业施加压力。 +
如果那种事情发生，激动的消费者试图劝服其他人,共同抵制两家公司的产品，从而危及企业声誉。当这种事情发生的时候，如果企业的回应不够快或不够好，那么就可能酿成悲剧。 +
比如，在今年较早前发生的召回危机中，丰田汽车公司采取了较快且较有序的社交媒体回应行动，包括在Twitter和社会新闻网站Digg等网站上与客户进行直接交流，从而挽回了部分损失。

It’s no surprise that 主 Jennifer Senior’s insightful(`=showing a clear understanding of a person or situation`), provocative(`=intended to make people angry or upset; intended to make people argue about sth`) magazine cover story, “I love My Children, I Hate My Life,” 谓 *is arousing* much chatter(`=to talk quickly and continuously, especially about things that are not important`) —— nothing *gets* people 宾补 talking [like the suggestion(`=you put forward an idea or plan for someone to think about`)] that child rearing 饲养；养育；抚养 *is* anything less than 绝非，绝不是 a completely fulfilling(`=causing sb to feel satisfied and useful`), life-enriching 丰富生活 experience.  
====
- anything less than 绝非，绝不是
====

毫无疑问，Jennifer Senior撰写的《我爱我的孩子，但我讨厌我的生活》是一篇见解独到又极富挑衅性的杂志封面文章，这样一篇引起人们的广泛讨论不足为奇——没有什么观点能让人们如此有兴趣地去讨论、这种观点 --话题是：养育孩子绝非是一种十分满足的、让生活充实的经历。

Rather than *concluding* that {children *make* parents either happy or miserable(`=very unhappy or uncomfortable`)}, Senior *suggests* {we *need to redefine* happiness: instead of *thinking of* it *as* something (that *can be measured by* moment-to-moment 即时反馈 joy), we *should consider* being happy *as* a past-tense condition 状况;状态}. 

Even though the day-to-day experience of raising kids *can be* soul-crushingly(`=to emphasize the degree of a negative quality`) 让人受不了地;过分地 hard, Senior *writes* that {“主 the very things that [in the moment] *dampen*(`=to make sth such as a feeling or a reaction less strong`) our moods 谓 *can [later] be* sources of intense(`=very great; very strong`) gratification(`=the state of feeling pleasure`) and delight.”}

Jennifer Senior没有指出养孩子到底是使得父母快乐呢，还是痛苦呢，她倒是认为，我们需要重新定义幸福：幸福不应该是一个个瞬间的快乐组合的，可以被衡量的东西；我们应该把幸福视为一种过去式的状态。尽管抚养孩子的日子漫长难熬，令人筋疲力尽，但是Jennifer Senior认为，正是那些心绪沉重的时刻，日后却成为我们欢乐的源泉。

The magazine cover (*showing* an attractive mother *holding* a cute baby) *is hardly* the only Madonna 圣母马利亚-and-child image on newsstands 报摊;售报亭 this week.  +
There *are* also stories about newly adoptive(a.)(`=one that has legally adopted a child`) —— and newly single —— mom Sandra Bullock, as well as the usual “Jennifer Aniston is pregnant(a.)” news.  +
Practically(`=almost; very nearly`) every week *features*(`=to include a particular person or thing as a special feature`) at least one celebrity (尤指娱乐界的)名人，明星 mom, or mom-to-be, *smiling* on the newsstands.
====
- is hardly the only ：绝对不是...唯一的、几乎不是...唯一的、不只会是...唯一的。这绝非是本周报摊上唯一的圣母婴图像.
====
杂志封面上，一位给力的母亲抱着一个可爱的婴儿，这种圣母与圣子(麦当娜和孩子)的图画，这周在杂志上多次出现。 +
(展现“魅力妈妈怀抱可爱宝宝”的杂志封面并非本周报摊上唯一对“圣母与圣子”形象的描述。) +
例如杂志上讲到，最近刚收养孩子的母亲——有时是刚变成单身母亲——桑德拉布鲁克，以及那种很常见的“詹尼弗阿尼斯顿怀孕了”的新闻。实际上，每周都有至少一位名人母亲、或者准母亲，在杂志上笑迎读者。

[In a society (that so persistently(`=happens again and again or for a long time`) *celebrates*(`=to praise sb/sth`) procreation 生殖；生产)], *is it any wonder(`=to be very surprised by sth`) that* {{*admitting*(`=to agree, often unwillingly, that sth is true`) you *regret*(v.)悔恨;失望 having children} *is equivalent 相等的,相当的 to* {*admitting* you *support*(v.) kitten小猫-killing}} ? 
====
- 本句的骨架是 : is it any wonder that {admitting... is equivalent to admitting...} +
- In a society (that so persistently celebrates procreation), is it any wonder that {admitting you regret having children *is equivalent to* admitting you support kitten-killing} ?
====
在一个不断庆祝生育的社会里，承认你后悔生孩子就等于承认你支持杀小猫，这有什么奇怪的吗?

It *doesn’t seem* quite fair, then, *to compare* the regrets of parents *to* the regrets of the children.  +
Unhappy parents [rarely] *are provoked*(`=to cause a particular reaction or have a particular effect`) *to wonder* {if they *shouldn’t have had* kids}, but unhappy childless folks *are bothered*(`=to annoy, worry or upset sb`) with the message (that children *are* the single most important thing in the world): obviously their misery(n.)(`=great suffering of the mind or body`) *must be* a direct result of the gaping (洞、伤口等)张开，裂开 baby-size holes in their lives.

在一个不断地庆祝生育的社会中，承认自己后悔生育孩子，就相当于承认自己支持杀小猫，这难道不值得反思吗？ +
把父母的后悔与孩子的后悔相比较，这显然并不合理。没有人会去让不情愿养孩子的父母去反思自己是否不该养孩子，但是那不幸福的没有孩子的人，却为类似这样的信息所困扰：“孩子是世上唯一最可珍惜的东西”，显然，你们的不幸，必须通过生儿育女才能得以消除。 +
(不快乐的父母很少被刺激去思考：他们是否不该有孩子;但不开心的没有孩子的夫妻却常被下面的信息骚扰：孩子才是世界上最重要的事情：很明显，他们的痛苦就是他们生活中一个张开的婴儿大小的洞造成的直接后果。)

Of course, the image of parenthood(`=the state of being a parent`) (that celebrity(`=a famous person`) magazines like Us Weekly and People *present*(v.)) *is* hugely 不切实际的;不实事求是的, especially when the parents *are* single mothers like Bullock. 

According to several studies (*concluding* that parents *are* less happy than childless couples), single parents *are* the least happy of all.  

No shock(`=a strong feeling of surprise`) there, *considering* how much work it is *to raise* 抚养;饲养 a kid without a partner *to lean on*(`=to depend on sb/sth for help and support`); yet 但是；然而 *to hear* Sandra and Britney *tell* it, raising a kid [on their “own”] (read: with round-the-clock(`=lasting or happening all day and night`) help) *is* a piece of cake 一块蛋糕; 小菜一碟; 轻松的事; 易如反掌的事.

当然，像美国周刊与人物这样的杂志提供的名人父母的形象，是非常不切实际的。特别是像Bullock这样的单身母亲时，更是如此。多项研究表明，有孩子的父母很少比没有孩子的夫妇更快乐，而单亲家庭是最不快乐的。这并不奇怪，因为一个人养一个孩子实在太麻烦了，没有人可以依靠。然而，你听听Sandra和Britney说的话：自己“一个人”养孩子，其实非常简单。(她们当然觉得简单了，因为她们是在周围有一帮人全天侯的侯着啊。) +
(这不足为奇，想想看，没有配有帮忙，独自抚养孩子是一项多么艰巨的任务；然而，听听布洛克和小甜甜布兰妮的说法：“单独”抚养孩子不过是小事一桩（其实，有全职保姆帮忙）。)

It’s hard *to imagine* that {many people *are* dumb(`=stupid`) enough *to want* children just because Reese and Angelina *make* it *look* so glamorous(`=especially attractive and exciting, and different from ordinary things or people`)}: most adults *understand* that {a baby *is not* a haircut}. 

But it’s interesting *to wonder* {if 主 the images (we see every week) of stress-free 无压力的；无应力, happiness-enhancing 提升幸福感 parenthood 谓 *aren’t* [in some small, subconscious 下意识的;潜意识的 way] *contributing to* our own dissatisfactions 不满;不悦 with the actual experience}, in the same way that a small part of us *hoped* {主 getting “ the Rachel” 谓 might *make* 宾 us 宾补look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston}.
====
- 句子的骨架是: if the images aren’t contributing to ... [in the same way that...]
- 介词短语 in some small, subconscious way 插入在谓语 aren't...contributing to 中间，充当方式状语。
- in the same way that a small ...like Jennifer Aniston 是一个方式状语从句，修饰谓语contributing。在这个方式状语从句中， a small part of us 是主语， hoped 是谓语动词，其后带有一个宾语从句（that）getting "the Rachel" might make us...like Jennifer Aniston，这里 that 被省去了。在这个宾语从句中，主语是getting "the Rachel"这个动名词短语，谓语是might make，后边 us look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston 是一个复合宾语（即宾语us+不定式短语 look just...宾语补足语）。

- if 主 the images (we see every week of stress-free,happiness-enhancing parenthood) 谓 aren't [in some small, subconscious way] contributing to 宾 our own dissatisfactions with the actual experience, [方式状 in the same way that a small part of us hoped {主 getting "the Rachel" 谓 might make 宾 us 宾补 look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston}].
====

很难想象有的人生孩子，就只是很傻很天真，因为Reese和Angelina这种名流使这种行为变的很光鲜，——多数成年人其实理解：养孩子可不是剪头发那样简单。 +
但这确实有趣：反思一下我们每周看到的无忧无虑，幸福诱人的为人父母的生活，会不会从一种微小的，无意识的方面，加剧我们对于现实生活的不满。

这种方式就好像：我们有那种想成为“ the Rachel”(老友记中的单身妈妈)的心理，这种心理，使得我们看上去有点像詹尼弗安尼斯顿(Rachel 的扮演者)。(这种方式就好像：我们中有一小部分人会觉得，要是成为瑞秋(单身妈妈)就有可能使我们看上去有点像詹尼弗安尼斯顿了。) +
句意是说，思考下这个问题其实很有意思：我们每周（在电视上）都看到的那些美好的亲情画面究竟会不会在潜意识里让我们对现实的落差感到失望呢？就像我们隐约会希望，假使我也去做了Rachel的发型，也许我就能多少有点像Jennifer Aniston了吧。
