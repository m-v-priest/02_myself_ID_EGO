== Why governments move civil servants out of national capitals

Take Norway, which since 2006 has shifted 转移；挪动 1,600 civil-service jobs out of Oslo 挪威首都. **The competition 竞争；角逐 authority** 当局；官方；当权者 is in Bergen 挪威城市名, the second city.

The trend reflects (v.) how the world has changed.

In past eras, when information *travelled [at a snail’s 蜗牛 pace]*, civil servants had to *cluster 群聚；聚集) together*. But now desk-workers can ping  发送（电子邮件、手机短信） emails and video-chat around the world. Travel for face-to-face meetings *may be unavoidable*, but transport links, too, have improved.

主 Proponents 倡导者；支持者；拥护者 of moving civil servants around 谓 promise (v.)许诺；承诺 countless benefits. +
*It disperses （使）分散，散开；疏散；驱散) the risk* that a *terrorist attack* or *natural disaster* will cripple 严重毁坏（或损害）;使残废；使成瘸子 an entire government.  +
Wonks 一味苦干的人；书呆子 in the sticks 边远乡村地区 *will be inspired  赋予灵感；启发思考 by new ideas* that walled-off  用墙把…隔开 capitals cannot *conjure  变魔术；变戏法；使…变戏法般地出现（或消失） up* 使…呈现于脑际；使想起.

以挪威为例，自2006年以来，该国已将1600个公务员岗位迁出奥斯陆。竞争管理机构设在卑尔根，第二大城市。 +
这一趋势反映了世界的变化。在过去，信息传播速度慢如蜗牛，公务员们不得不挤在一起。但现在，办公人员可以在世界各地发送电子邮件和进行视频聊天。面对面会议的旅行可能是不可避免的，但交通联系也得到了改善。

支持对公务员做调动的人, 承诺说, 这将带来数不尽的好处。它分散了恐怖袭击或自然灾害使整个政府瘫痪的风险。住在乡下的书呆子们也会受到新思想的启发，而这些新思想是被隔离的首都所无法带给人的。

-> 英语单词pedigree（家谱）源自古法语中的pied de gru（foot of crane），因为鹤的脚丫形状与树状的家谱图很像。pedigree中的pe=foot，如impede（妨碍）。 pedigree：['pedɪgriː] n.家谱，血统adj.纯种的

分散中央政府的职能, 通常有三个具体的目标: 1.改善公务员和那些住在拥堵的首都中的人的生活; 2.为了省钱; 3.并纠正地区失衡。问题是，这些目标并不总是能够实现。

第一个目标——改善生活条件—— 该目标其实由来已久。第二次世界大战后，伦敦重建时，英国把成千上万的公务员迁往“令人愉快的英国乡村小镇”。但是，将首都转移到更小的地方, 并不总是令人愉快的。雇员流失率可以超过80%。

to send sb somewhere, especially because you do not want them with you 把…打发走

.mop sth/sb up
to remove the liquid from sth using sth that absorbs it 吸干净；吸去…的水分

让官僚们搬离老首都的第二个原因, 是为了省钱。在首都，办公空间的成本要高得多。上世纪70年代末，伦敦房地产市场陷入停滞，政府失去了搬迁的热情。搬到其他地方的机构, 通常可以用比在首都更低的薪水来招聘到更好的员工，而在首都，能提供高薪的跨国公司, 会挖走人才(即政府能提供的薪资比不过跨国公司, 也就招不到人才)。

The third reason to shift 系 is to rebalance (v.) regional inequality.

Norway *treats federal jobs as a resource* every region *deserves to enjoy*, like profits from oil.

将公务员搬出首都的的第三个目的, 是重新平衡地区之间的不平等。 +
2003年至2010年间，当英国将伦敦20%的公务员迁出时，它经常选择那些失业率高的地区，比如威尔士的纽波特市，该市曾遭受工业衰退的打击，现在则是国家统计局(ONS)的总部所在地。挪威将联邦政府的工作视为是每个地区都应该享有的资源，就像石油带来的利润一样。

*The dilemma （进退两难的）窘境，困境 is obvious.* 主 Pick small, poor towns, and areas of high unemployment 谓 get new jobs, but it is hard to attract *the most qualified workers*;  +

这种两难境地是显而易见的。选择小的，贫穷的城镇，和高失业率的地区, 作为搬迁目的地, 能够为这些地方创造出新的工作岗位，但是却很难吸引最合格的员工; 而选择那些有基础设施和更合格居民的大城市为政府搬迁地，则会使国家中最贫困的地区几乎看不到什么受益。

==== <pure> Why governments move civil servants out of national capitals


Take Norway, which since 2006 has shifted 1,600 civil-service jobs out of Oslo. The competition authority is in Bergen, the second city.

The trend reflects how the world has changed. In past eras, when information travelled at a snail’s pace, civil servants had to cluster together. But now desk-workers can ping emails and video-chat around the world. Travel for face-to-face meetings may be unavoidable, but transport links, too, have improved.

主 Proponents of moving civil servants around 谓 promise countless benefits. It disperses the risk that a terrorist attack or natural disaster will cripple an entire government. Wonks in the sticks will be inspired by new ideas that walled-off capitals cannot conjure up.

Dispersing central-government functions 谓 usually has three specific aims: to improve the lives of both civil servants and those living in clogged capitals; to save money; and to redress regional imbalances. The trouble is that these goals are not always realised.

The first aim — improving living conditions — has a long pedigree. [After the second world war] Britain moved thousands of civil servants to “agreeable English country towns” [as London was rebuilt]. But swapping the capital for somewhere smaller is not always agreeable. Attrition rates can exceed 80%.


主 The second reason to pack bureaucrats off 系 is to save money. Office space costs far more in capitals. [When London’s property market stagnated in the late 1970s] the government lost enthusiasm for relocation. 主 Agencies that are moved elsewhere 谓 can often recruit better workers on lower salaries than in capitals, where well-paying multinationals mop up talent.

Balancing act The third reason to shift is to rebalance regional inequality. [In Mexico] AMLO laments the “tragedy” of those who have to move to big cities to make a living. The day the culture ministry opened in Tlaxcala, 70 locals turned up with their CVs. When Britain moved 20% of London’s civil servants between 2003 and 2010, it often picked areas with high unemployment, such as Newport, a Welsh city hit by industrial decline that now houses the headquarters of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Norway treats federal jobs as a resource (every region deserves to enjoy), like profits from oil.


Where government jobs go, private ones follow. 主 A study of Berlin after Germany’s federal workforce was moved from Bonn in 1999 谓 found that the arrival of 100 government jobs in an area helped create 55 private-sector jobs. A review of Britain’s relocations in the 2000s found the same ratio. The jobs (created) tend to be in services, often the law or consultancy.

The dilemma is obvious. 主 Pick small, poor towns, and areas of high unemployment 谓 get new jobs, but it is hard to attract the most qualified workers; opt for larger cities with infrastructure and better-qualified residents, and the country’s most deprived areas see little benefit.

Overall, then, Dr Sgroi and Dr Proto found that *happiness does vary (v.)（根据情况）变化，变更，改变  with GDP*.

.episodic :
ADJ Something that is episodic *occurs at irregular and infrequent intervals*. 偶然发生的; 不定期的

-  ...*episodic attacks* of fever. ...不定期的发烧。


总体而言，斯格罗伊和普罗图发现, 幸福感确实会随GDP的变化而改变。健康和预期寿命的影响, 不像繁荣、萧条和武装冲突那样断断续续，但它们的影响更大，即使把财富改善健康的趋势考虑在内。例如，寿命延长一年，对国民幸福感的影响, 与GDP增长4.3％的影响相同。而且，正如对漫长历史的探究所显示的那样，战争导致幸福感下降最多。平均而言，一年的战争所导致的幸福感降幅, 需要GDP增长30%才能拉平。结果似乎是，虽然增加国民收入对提升幸福感很重要，但确保人口健康和避免冲突的作用更大。

== China’s “maritime road”

To measure the maritime (a.)海的；海事的 road’s impact, we tested three benefits it could offer China.

And if it were intended *to secure 保卫；使安全 current trade routes*, its ports should sit near *choke （掐住喉咙）使窒息 points* — areas whose closure （永久的）停业，关闭；倒闭 would force (v.) goods *to travel circuitously* 迂回地；曲折地  — or in places that offer (v.) alternative routes.

为检验这些解释是否合理，我们利用它们来预测各个国家能否吸引到“一带一路”的港口项目。结论是明确的。在其他因素不变的情况下，建设“一带一路”港口, 与出口中国所需的原材料, 在统计上没有显著关联，与当前已存在或未来可能发生的大笔对华贸易的关联也不显著。 +

=> 来自拉丁语 saccus,袋子，来自希腊语 sakkos,袋子，来自某闪族语词，比较希伯来语 saq,袋 子。通常指比较大的袋子，引申词义麻袋，购物袋等，后引申比喻义抢劫及现代词义解雇， 开除，卷包袱走人。

.nimble
=> 来自PIE*nem,分开，分配，拿，带，词源同number,numb.引申词义灵活的，敏捷的。

.telling :
(a.) *having a strong or important effect; effective* 强有力的；有明显效果的；显著的 +
-> a telling argument 有力的论据 +
(2) *showing effectively what sb/sth is really like, but often without intending to* 生动的；显露真实面目的，说明问题的（通常并非有意） +
-> The number of homeless people *is a telling comment* on the state of society. 无家可归者的数量是社会状况的生动写照。

.perk
=> 缩写自perquisite,津贴，额外补贴。

工资的粘性之大众所周知，尤其是在向下调整时。在低通胀的情况下，公司没法用让工资涨幅低于通胀的方式来削减薪资，这给宏观经济带来了严重后果。面对需求减少，那些无法在大幅降价时削减薪资以维持利润的公司,只能转而减产和裁员。

但灵活的公司还有其他选择，比如把刮掉一点巧克力这个办法挪到用工环节上。一些公司通过提高人均产量, 来削减成本 -- 通常是加大员工的劳动强度。很能说明问题的是，现在的人均产量增长往往在经济繁荣时下降，在衰退时上升，与40年前通胀高企时的规律正好相反。公司可以通过减少工人的福利来应对市场压力。阿斯达超市（Asda）最近就宣布了削减英国工人假期津贴的计划。或者公司也可以给员工安排更含混不清的工作时间。2017年发表的一项研究表明，如果可以每周调整员工的工作时间，便相当于至少节省了20%的工资支出。另一方面，在经济繁荣期，公司往往选择用办公室福利和一次性奖金来奖励员工，而不是给他们加薪，因为加好的薪水没法在衰退期轻易再降下来。

==== <pure> Prices for many goods do not move the way economists think they should


Every first-year economics student quickly becomes familiar with charts of supply and demand, which place price on one axis and quantity on the other. Given a drop in demand, the charts show, firms can either sell fewer items [at the prevailing price] or cut prices to prop up sales. But online retailing, which makes it easier to collect fine-grained price data, reveals how poorly textbook models reflect real-world market dynamics. The prices of consumer goods, it turns out, behave oddly.



A forthcoming paper by Diego Aparicio and Roberto Rigobon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology helps make the point. Firms that sell thousands of different items do not offer them at thousands of different prices, but rather slot them into a dozen or two price points. Visit the website for H&M, a fashion retailer, and you will find a staggering array of items for £9.99: hats, scarves, jewellery, belts, bags, herringbone braces, satin neckties, patterned shirts for dogs and much more. Another vast collection of items cost £6.99, and another, £12.99. When sellers change an item’s price, they tend not to nudge it a little, but rather to re-slot it into one of the pre-existing price categories. The authors dub this phenomenon “quantum pricing” (quantum mechanics grew from the observation that the properties of subatomic particles do not vary along a continuum, but rather fall into discrete states).


Just as surprising as the quantum way (in which prices adjust) is {how rarely they move at all}. 主 Retailers, Messrs Aparicio and Rigobon suggest, 谓 seem to design products to fit their preferred price points. Given a big enough shift in market conditions, such as an increase in labour costs, firms often redesign a product to fit the price rather than tweak the price. They may make a production process 宾补 less labour-intensive — or shave a bit off a chocolate bar.



Wages are notoriously sticky, especially downwards. In a world of low inflation, 主 the ability to trim pay [by raising wages less than inflation] 系 is lost  to firms, with serious macroeconomic consequences. Facing reduced demand, firms (that cannot cut pay to maintain margins while slashing prices) instead reduce output — and sack workers.

But nimble firms have other options: the employment version of shaving a bit of chocolate from the bar. Some cut costs by boosting output per worker, often by driving workers harder. Tellingly, growth in output per worker now tends to fall [in booms] and rise [during busts], precisely the opposite of the pattern 40 years ago, when inflation was high. Firms can respond to market pressures by reducing the benefits available to workers; Asda, a supermarket, recently announced plans to slash British workers’ holiday allowances. Or they can offer workers more tortuous schedules. Research published in 2017 suggests that {being able to vary  workers’ hours [from week to week] is worth at least 20% of their wages}. On the flipside, [during good times] firms often opt to reward workers with office perks and one-off bonuses, rather than pay rises that cannot easily be clawed back during downturns.

当时导弹发展面临的主要挑战是将武器升上天空。剩下的大部分工作都是由地心引力完成的。直到 20 世纪 80 年代，第一批能够在下降过程中操纵方向的弹头，才出现。即使是它们，其活动范围也很有限，因此很容易预测它们落点的目标区域。

新一代的极超音速导弹, 正在改变这一切。其中一些可能能够以极快的速度横跨大陆，他们的目标直到撞击前几秒钟才能预测。

.circular error probable :
圆形公算误差（英文简称CEP），是弹道学中的一种测量武器系统精确度的项目。其定义是 以目标为圆心划一个圆圈。如果武器命中此圆圈的机率最少有一半，则此圆圈的半径就是"圆形公算误差"。举例来说，美军三叉戟二型导弹的圆形公算误差是90米，则一枚此型导弹有50%的机率会落在目标90米以内。

.probable
(a.) likely to happen, to exist or to be true 很可能发生（或存在等）的


有两种基本设计:巡航导弹和滑翔机。高超音速巡航导弹,本质上是现有导弹的更快版本. 滑翔机...但与老式的抛射不同的是，它们在天空中, 并不遵循可预测的抛物线轨迹飞行。相反，高超音速滑翔飞行器(HGV), 在火箭仍在上升时, 就与火箭分离，要么沿着大气层上层进行跳跃，要么重新进入大气层, 并在大气层中滑行数百或数千公里。

这样的滑翔机有几个优点。弹道导弹不太灵活，而且往往不太精确。美国核武库的支柱—​民兵III型洲际弹道导弹的“圆形误差可能”约为120米，这意味着预计只有一半发射的导弹, 能落在落点120米以内。这对核弹来说很好，但对于想要击中船只或跑道来说, 就没什么用了。另一方面，今天的巡航导弹非常精确 — 它可以通过窗口发射, 但速度要慢得多。
