==== <pure> China tries to stop academics from taking its constitution literally

A YEAR BEFORE Xi Jinping became China’s leader, a 47-year-old professor at Peking University, Zhang Qianfan, delivered a talk to mark the 100th anniversary of the collapse of China’s last imperial dynasty, in 1911, charting the history of efforts since then to instil respect for constitutional principles. Students unable to find seats in the packed lecture theatre stood shoulder-to-shoulder around the walls. They grinned and clapped when he started by saying: “I have written down my true feelings… They may sound fierce. Forgive me if they cause offence.”

The thin, bespectacled academic held his audience spellbound. Those who, unable to find space in the room, had crowded by the doorway, were still there when he finished, almost two hours later. That was fortunate, because his final point was the most powerful in a lecture packed with indictments of China’s failure to implement the guarantees of its constitution, including freedom of speech, of assembly and of association. Mr Zhang wrapped up by listing 12 places where authoritarian rule had (at least briefly) crumbled, from the Soviet Union to Taiwan to countries that had recently experienced the Arab spring. “What their people can do,” he said, “the Chinese” — and here he paused briefly while the audience began to laugh and clap --“people can certainly do.” Wild applause ensued. Someone cried, “Good!”

Such a scene was extraordinary even at the time. The authorities were determined to prevent any attempt to replicate the Arab uprisings;  anonymous calls online for public gatherings in support of them drew more police than protesters. Mr Zhang says he was reprimanded for his speech. Invitations for him to talk on campuses dried up. But he kept his job. And remarkably his textbook, “An Introduction to the Study of Constitutional Law”, first published in 2004, was republished in 2014 by Law Press, which is controlled by the Ministry of Justice. The preface sets the tone: “The study of constitutional law must break down forbidden ideological zones, because the rights of Chinese citizens accept no forbidden zones.”

伊斯特林悖论 : 由美国南加州大学经济学教授理查德·伊斯特林（R.Easterlin）在1974年的著作《经济增长可以在多大程度上提高人们的快乐》中提出, 即他发现一个令人迷惑的重要问题是：为什么更多的财富并没有带来更大的幸福？对此的解释性理论包括:

1. 经济学仅关注收入、财富和消费，而忽略了影响人们幸福的其他许多重要因素，包括：激励与创造、健康、政治参与、社会渴望、自由、利他主义的丧失、不平等、社会资本的减少和地位外部性。特别是，如果这些非经济因素与收入、财富和消费等经济因素呈负相关时，那么随着GDP的增长，许多影响幸福的非经济因素会下降，从而在不同程度上抵消经济因素带来的正面作用.  +
2. 个人效用与自己的收入水平正相关，但与社会的平均收入水平（攀比水平）负相关；当社会变得更富裕时，攀比水平随之提高，导致收入—幸福曲线下移，从而使得总效用水平保持不变。一个人的主观福利与其相对地位有关。因此，地位竞争仅仅导致个人福利的再分配，而作为一个整体的社会的幸福并没有增加。

它探讨了中国的宣传机器如何做出非凡的努力来宣传这样一种观念，即在共产主义制度下，中国人享受着美好而有意义的生活 ——正是因为经济增长本身在产生幸福感方面做得不够。

早在 1974 年，美国经济学家理查德·伊斯特林 (Richard Easterlin)就发现了一个谜题。尽管较富裕的国家通常更满足，但物质繁荣的增加并不一定会导致自我报告的幸福水平不断提高。《中国话语》称中国是一个巨大的伊斯特林悖论。从 1990 年到 2015 年，中国人均实际 GDP增长了五倍多。然而，中国人自我报告的幸福感并没有随着经济同步攀升，而是从 1990 年开始急剧下降，并在 2000-05 年达到最低点（这段时间GDP 的高速增长）在恢复之前。它可能还没有恢复到1990.

伊斯特林与人合写的《2017年世界幸福报告》(2017 World Happiness Report)的一章, 深入研究了中国过去25年的数据，发现幸福与几个通常被认为是悲观的趋势之间, 存在微弱的相关性。

以收入不平等为例，从1980年到2010年，中国的收入不平等一直在上升。在同一时期，自我报告的幸福水平,呈u形下降和上升。这一章研究了其他幸福的“预测因素”，包括煤炭消费(污染的代表)、房价、人均GDP、健康预期寿命、自我报告的能做出重大决策的自由程度, 和腐败(通过询问被访者,贿赂是否可以被接受?)。这些指标中没有一个与中国人的幸福感密切相关。而另外两个却很适合:失业和社会保障。2000年至2005年，随着国有企业重组，失业率飙升，社会保障体系崩溃，中国人的苦难(尤其是低收入人群)进一步加深。而随着就业率的回升，幸福感也随之回升。

即使是那些通常被认为是受益于中国经济开放的人 —— 在过去30年里, 在城市中找到工作的数亿农民工 ——总体上也并不乐观。最新的《世界幸福报告》(World Happiness Report)-- 从2018年开始发布 — 该报告发现，平均而言，中国的移民, 通过移居到城市中来获得更高的收入，但一旦移居完成之后，他们却表示，自己的幸福感不如那些早在城市中定居的人。更令人惊讶的是，这些农民工甚至比留在农村中的表亲们,更不快乐。深入研究这些数据，你会发现，最不幸福的农民工的工作, 通常缺乏安全感、工作条件苛刻、收入微薄，这将他们推入了一个更痛苦的社会底层中，因为户籍法律限制了他们子女上学和享受其他公共服务的机会。日益繁荣的经济无法弥补他们被排除在外的感觉。

==== <pure> Why so glum, China?


IT TOOK 125 years for America’s Declaration of Independence to reach a wide Chinese audience, and when it did, some lofty phrases got lost. The earliest known(a.) Chinese translation of the declaration, published in 1901 by young nationalists burning to overthrow the Qing empire, is an impatient, combative text. 主 The document’s name, noted the scholar who rediscovered it, Frank Li of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 谓 became the “American War Proclamation of Independence”. The rights it deemed inalienable — “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” — turned into something bleaker: “life, liberty and all interests”.


It explores how China’s propaganda machine devotes extraordinary efforts to promoting the idea that the Chinese people enjoy good and meaningful lives under Communism — precisely because economic growth alone does a poor job of generating happiness.

Back in 1974 Richard Easterlin, an American economist, spotted a puzzle. Although richer countries are generally more contented, rising material prosperity does not necessarily lead to ever-higher levels of self-reported well-being. “Chinese Discourses” calls China a giant Easterlin Paradox. Chinese real GDP per person grew more than fivefold between 1990 and 2015. Yet, rather than climbing [in lockstep] with the economy, the self-reported happiness of the Chinese fell sharply from 1990, reaching a nadir in 2000-05 (a time of breakneck GDP growth) before recovering. It has probably yet to regain the level of 1990.

A chapter of the 2017 World Happiness Report, co-written by Mr Easterlin, dug into Chinese data from the previous quarter-century and found weak correlations between happiness and several trends commonly blamed for gloom. Take inequality of income, which in China marched upwards between 1980 and about 2010. During the same period levels of self-reported happiness fell and rose in a U-shape. The chapter studies other “predictors” of happiness, including the consumption of coal (a proxy for pollution), housing prices, GDP per person, healthy-life expectancy, self-reported levels of freedom to make big decisions and corruption (measured by asking whether bribery is acceptable). None of these indicators tracks happiness closely in China. Two others are a good fit: unemployment and access to social safety nets. Misery, notably among low-income Chinese, deepened as unemployment spiked and safety nets collapsed in 2000-05, as state-owned firms were restructured. As employment rebounded, so did happiness.

Even people (normally considered clear beneficiaries of China’s economic opening) — the hundreds of millions of rural migrants who found work in cities over the past 30 years — are not collectively cheerier. The most recent World Happiness Report, from 2018, finds that, on average, Chinese migrants secure higher incomes by moving to cities but, once there, say they are less happy than long-established city folk. More surprisingly, such migrants are also unhappier than cousins who stayed in the countryside. Dig into the numbers, and the jobs of the unhappiest migrants are unusually insecure, harsh and badly paid, thrusting them into an underclass made more painful by hukou residency laws that limit their access to schooling for their children and other public services. Rising prosperity cannot compensate for a sense of being left out.

- I'd prefer to reserve (my) judgement (= not make a decision) until I know all the facts. 在了解全部事实之前我不想发表意见。


.vulnerable
⇒ 来自拉丁语 vulnus,伤口，来自 PIE wele,拔，击打，词源同 wool,vulture.引申词义有伤口的， 脆弱的。

.indiscriminate
⇒ dis-, 分开，散开。-crim, 区分，词源同crime, crisis. 即区分开，区别对待，歧视。


我们的受访者发现，比起臭名昭著的骚扰者，说出有名的恶霸要容易得多。一位资深教授说，她发现了一种特别的肮脏，专门保留给并施加在那些被视为脆弱的人身上，包括女性。另一些人则声称, 他们只看到了那些不论对方身份为何人, 都无差别进行骚扰的“混蛋”。

self的复数. 自己

不公平的待遇, 可能是无意识中造成的。资深教授可能会无意识地偏爱那些看起来像他们年轻时的自己的学生。他们可能喜欢边喝酒边谈工作，这可能会让年轻女性感到不舒服。一位博士生说，她觉得女学生很难与男教授沟通。她怀疑这在一定程度上是由于对骚扰的潜在担忧。

==== <prue> Academic sexism

In any case, the survey yielded more than enough reports of sexual harassment. Nearly 2,000 respondents said they had been embarrassed or offended by inappropriate gestures, remarks or materials from other economists. Hundreds reported experiences of attempted or actual sexual assault by a colleague or student in the past ten years. And 267 reported that they would have been rewarded [had they co-operated with unwanted sexual attention], or threatened with retaliation [had they not].

A meta-analysis of studies of the prevalence of sexual harassment in 2003 ranked academia second only to the armed forces.

Our interviewees found it much easier to name prominent bullies than notorious harassers. A senior professor said that she had seen a special nastiness (reserved for people regarded as vulnerable, including women). Others claimed only to have seen “assholes” who were indiscriminate in their aggression.


Unfair treatment can be unwitting. Senior professors may be unconsciously drawn to favour students who look like their younger selves. They may like chatting about work over a drink, which young women may find uncomfortable. One PhD student said she felt that female students found {it harder to connect with male professors}. She suspected {that was partly due to unspoken worries about harassment}.


Then there is the style of seminars, for which economics is notorious. Interruptions and intense questioning are supposed to weed out errors and uncover sloppy thinking. And several interviewees told of supportive sub-fields and departments, where the primary purpose was not to tear down the speaker. But one said she felt like quitting after seeing how a female presenter was treated. Another economist reported being asked during a presentation whether she knew any economics, and being interrupted incessantly.

Among macroeconomists, whose field is both particularly short of women and infamous for bare-knuckled seminars, 40% of those responding to the AEA’s survey felt “disrespected”; among female macroeconomists, 70% did.

== 激光 核聚变点火 trans

Un peu d’histoire

主 The idea of harnessing(v.)控制，利用（以产生能量等） the process that powers(v.) the sun 谓 goes back almost as far as the discovery, in the 1920s and 1930s, of what that process is —namely the fusion  融合, 核聚变 of protons, the nuclei 核心, 原子核 of hydrogen atoms, to form(v.) helium 氦 nuclei (latexmath:[ ^4 He]), also known as alpha particles. This reaction yields(v.) 出产（作物）；产生（收益、效益等）；提供 something less than the sum of its parts, for an alpha particle is lighter than four free protons. But the missing mass has not disappeared; it has merely been transformed. As per 按照，依据；如同 Einstein’s equation, latexmath:[ E=mc^2], it has been converted into energy, in the form of heat.

掌控"为太阳提供能量的过程"这种力量, 这个想法可以远溯到 1920 年代和 30 年代, 那时发现了其原理是什么 —— 即质子的聚变，即氢原子核转变成了氦核 ( latexmath:[ ^4 He] )，也称为阿尔法粒子。这个反应产生出的物质, 质量小于原先各部分的总和，因为一个 alpha 粒子比四个自由质子轻。但是丢失的质量并没有消失；它只是被转变了。根据爱因斯坦方程式 latexmath:[ E=m c^2]，它已经以热的形式, 转化成了能量。

PHRASE If you see or hit something at close range or from close range, you are very close to it when you see it or hit it. If you do something at a range of half a mile, for example, you are half a mile away from it when you do it. 近距离内


让原子核发生聚变, 需要热量、压力, 或两者兼而有之。压力缩小了原子核之间的空间，促使它们相遇。热量使它们移动得足够快，以至于当它们相遇时，它们可以克服相互间的静电斥力，也就是所谓的库仑势垒，从而允许一种只在近距离内起作用的强核力现象发生。强作用力将质子和中子结合在一起形成原子核，因此一旦库仑势垒被突破，一个新的更大的原子核就会迅速形成。

2022 年 12 月，NIF宣布它已达到点火状态，引起了轰动。但释放的能量不到消耗能量的 1%，这意味着它离商业聚变的另一个必要条件Q >1 还很远。Q是机器输出的能量与输入的能量之比。不同版本的Q对“输出”和“输入”有不同的定义。但与商业最相关的是“即插即用”——即, 从电网获取能量以运行整个聚变反应器所需的电力，与将产生的能量输回电网的能量之间的比率。Marvel 和 Xcimer 专注于满足Q >1 的定义。

证明"可控核聚变"可行性的第一步, 就是“Q>1”，即输出的能量, 大于维持反应所需输入的能量，核聚变反应可以依靠自身产生的能量维持。这一临界状态被称作收支平衡，也叫“点火”。

This sounded technologically promising. But it was soon apparent that doing it the way the sun does is a non-starter.

Persuading nuclei to fuse requires heat, pressure or both. The pressure reduces the space between the nuclei, encouraging them to meet. The heat keeps them travelling fast enough that when they do meet, they can overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion, known as the Coulomb barrier, and thus allow a phenomenon called the strong nuclear force, which works only at short range, to take over. The strong force holds protons and neutrons together to form nuclei, so once the Coulomb barrier is breached, a new and larger nucleus quickly forms.

The temperature at which solar fusion occurs, though high (15.5m°C), is well within engineers’ reach. Experimental reactors can manage 100m°C and there are hopes to go higher still. But the pressure (250bn atmospheres) eludes them. Moreover, solar fusion’s raw material is recalcitrant.
