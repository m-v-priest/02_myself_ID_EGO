== Millions of women are missing out on hormone replacement therapy

Menopause 绝经期；（妇女的）更年期 harms women’s bones, brains, hearts and immune systems.

*It is associated with* a higher risk of osteoporosis 骨质疏松；骨质疏松症 and *fragility 脆弱性;易碎性 fractures* （指状态）骨折，断裂, increased (v.) abdominal 腹部的 fat 脂肪, and a *heightened (v.)加剧 risk of* contracting 感染,得（病） diabetes 糖尿病, explains Susan Davis, a professor of women’s health at Monash University in Australia.


*The hormonal 荷尔蒙的，激素的 changes of menopause* also seem to make women age (v.)变老 faster.

They speed up *cellular ageing* (n.) by about 6%, when age is measured by the genetic changes in the blood. *It is suspected 怀疑；感觉有问题；不信任 that* the insomnia 失眠（症） (associated (a.)有关联的；相关的 with menopause) could be causing this.

Oestrogen 雌激素 is particularly important in maintaining the health of women’s hearts.

[Before menopause] women have fewer *heart attacks* than men. [After menopause] the risk increases (v.) as the elasticity 弹性；弹力 of *the coronary (a.)冠状动脉的 arteries* 动脉 decreases 减少,降低 along with their oestrogen 雌激素 levels.

更年期会损害女性的骨骼、大脑、心脏和免疫系统。澳大利亚莫纳什大学(Monash University)的女性健康教授苏珊•戴维斯(Susan Davis)解释说，肥胖会增加骨质疏松和脆性骨折的风险，增加腹部脂肪，并增加患糖尿病的风险。

更年期的荷尔蒙变化, 似乎也会让女性衰老得更快。当通过血液中的基因变化, 来测量年龄时，它们会使细胞衰老速度加快约6%。人们怀疑与更年期相关的失眠可能是造成这一现象的原因。雌激素在维持女性心脏健康方面尤为重要。绝经前女性的心脏病发作比男性少。绝经后，随着冠状动脉弹性的降低, 和雌激素水平的降低，患病风险增加。

In 1966 Robert Wilson, a doctor, wrote a book called “Feminine （指气质或外貌）女性特有的，女性的 Forever”.

In it, he argued that 主 women’s loss of hormones after menopause 谓 *give rise to* a serious, painful and often *crippling (a.)严重损害健康的; 致残的 illness*, known as **oestrogen-deficiency (n.)缺乏；缺少；不足 disease**.

主 *A regular (a.)规则的；有规律的；定时的 course* 行动方式,（医疗、服药等的）疗程 of oestrogen supplements 补充（物）；添加物 系 was the solution, he suggested.


By the turn of the millennium 一千年，千年期（尤指公元纪年） *hormone-replacement therapy* 治疗；疗法 was extremely popular.

In America [before 2001] some 20% of *post-menopausal 绝经后的 women* used it *at some point*.

1966年，医生罗伯特·威尔逊写了一本名为《永远女性化》的书。在这本书中，他认为女性在绝经后失去荷尔蒙, 会导致一种严重的、痛苦的、常常是致命的疾病，即雌激素缺乏症。他建议，解决方案是定期服用雌激素补充剂。

在世纪之交，激素替代疗法还是非常流行。在2001年以前，美国有20%的绝经后妇女使用过它。那时, 一种合成形式的黄体酮, 与雌激素一起使用; 它已经被证明可以保护妇女避免因单独注射雌激素而增加的患子宫癌的风险。

The benefits of HRT seemed clear. *Most immediately* 紧接地；直接地, it offered relief (n.) （焦虑、痛苦等的）减轻，缓和 from the miserable  痛苦的；非常难受的；可怜的 symptoms of menopause.

[In the longer term] it reduced the risk of osteoporosis 骨质疏松 (which rises after menopause) and therefore the risk of bone fractures.

Women liked that it seemed to stop their *skin thinning* (probably because it boosts the levels of collagen 胶原蛋白, a protein).

*It was thought* to reduce (v.) the risk of *cognitive 认知的；感知的 decline*.

But most importantly, studies suggested that it prevented *the onset (n.)开端，发生，肇始（尤指不快的事件） of* cardiovascular (a.) 心血管 disease — one of the biggest killers of women.

HRT的好处似乎很明显。最直接的是，它缓解了更年期的痛苦症状。从长期来看，它降低了骨质疏松症(绝经后会增加)的风险，因此也降低了骨折的风险。女性还喜欢它似乎能阻止皮肤变薄(可能是因为它能提高胶原蛋白的水平)。它被认为可以降低认知能力下降的风险。但最重要的是，研究表明，它可以预防心血管疾病 — 女性的最大杀手之一。

但接着一颗重磅炸弹落了下来。2002年，由美国国立卫生研究院进行的一项大型随机试验，即妇女健康倡议(WHI)的结果, 被迅速发表。研究得出的结论是，将雌激素与人造黄体酮一起服用, 会增加女性患乳腺癌、心脏病、中风和血栓的风险。妇女们被告知，荷尔蒙替代疗法的危险远远大于益处。

但是，WHI研究的第一个结论几乎是完全错误的，而对激素替代疗法的许多反感, 仍然是基于此第一个结论而做出。这项研究, 希望着眼于探寻策略, 用来预防绝经后妇女会患心脏病、癌症和骨质疏松症。

现在很清楚，激素替代疗法, 对进入更年期的妇女的长期益处是显著的。对这些研究进行仔细地重新分析后, 表明，在服用激素的五到七年内，50多岁的女性的死亡率实际上降低了31%。对于那些已经摘除子宫, 或在45岁之前进入更年期的女性来说，这是一种救命的方法，可以预防骨质疏松症和心脏病, 长达18年之久。虽然接受荷尔蒙替代疗法治疗5年后，乳腺癌的发病率略有上升, 但这比做空乘的风险还要低。

今年早些时候发表在英国医学杂志《柳叶刀》(Lancet)上的一项研究，再次引发了关于激素疗法会导致乳腺癌风险水平的争议。但是戴维斯女士和其他人担心, 其结论不可靠。此外，任何风险的增加, 都必须与发展其他疾病的风险, 进行权衡。

在缺乏此类研究的情况下，HRT仍处于医学上悬而未决的状态。因此，40多岁和50多岁的女性正在失去机会。开始进行激素替代疗法, 以获得其全部好处(包括抵抗认知衰退的影响)的机会, 窗口期可能只有两到三年。

In the century that followed, TB (*as* the illness *is called for short* 简略的；缩写的) beat a retreat （仓促）逃走；（慌忙）撤退 thanks to antibiotics and a vaccine that protected infants 婴儿；幼儿. By the 1990s *wiping 擦,拭,抹去（旧事） it out completely* seemed *tantalisingly 挑逗性地,撩人地 within reach*.

然而，从那以后，进展一直很缓慢。新病例每年仅下降 1-2%。今天，结核分枝杆菌杀死的人数超过任何其他单一病原体（见图表）。

结核病难以攻克的原因之一是结核分枝杆菌的生命周期不同寻常。当有人吸入这种病毒时，它要么立即被免疫系统杀死，要么在肺部定居。不过，它不会立即引起症状，而是通常保持休眠状态 ——这种状态称为潜伏感染，不会传染。世界上大约四分之一的人口, 患有这种潜伏性结核病。但只有大约 10% 的感染者, 会继续出现症状。通常，那些免疫系统较弱的人。感染 HIV 的人处于特别危险之中（大约 40% 的 HIV 阳性个体死亡, 是由结核病引起的）。其他出现症状的风险高于平均水平的人, 是营养不良者、吸烟者和酗酒者。

⇒ 来自词根corp，身体，见corporeal.


强奸是最难起诉的罪行之一。谋杀之后，会有一具尸体。相比之下，强奸之后可能根本就没有物证。通常，犯罪发生的唯一证据, 就是受害者的话，而被告则断然否认。当她的话与他的相反时，就很难确实地证明, 原告说的是实话，而被告在撒谎。当公众——因而也是陪审员们——对典型的强奸是什么样子，以及可信的指控听起来像是什么样子, 有很深的误解时，情况就更是如此。

许多面对这两种说法的人, 会觉得乔的说法更可信。人们通常认为, 强奸会涉及简的描述中明显缺失了的几样东西：在性需求上呈掠食性的陌生人，用于造成威胁或伤害人的武器，一个隐蔽的作案地点，以及一位急于立马报案的受害者。"他们的这种认识是错的", 法医精神病学家芭芭拉·齐夫(Barbara Ziv)说.

许多报告都是在事件发生很久之后才发布的；2017年在英格兰和威尔士报告的袭击事件中，有超过四分之一是发生在一年前。被报告的强奸案中, 约有80%, 是受害者所认识的人犯下的。

性侵犯通常既不涉及武器，也不涉及明显的伤害。2017年, 对英格兰和威尔士的犯罪调查发现，最常见的地点, 是在受害者的家中(39%)，第二常见的地点是在犯罪者的家中(24%)。只有10%发生在公园或街道等公共场所中。在声称是强奸受害者的人中，近三分之一的人说, 他们没有告诉任何人；超过一半的人告诉了熟人；不到五分之一的人告诉了警方。

.ordeal
/ɔːrˈdiːl/
(=~ (of sth/of doing sth) : a difficult or unpleasant experience 磨难；折磨；煎熬；严酷的考验 +
⇒ 字面意思就是“deal out by gods”（由神灵来施加惩罚）。现在引申为“严峻的考验”。

.flirt
⇒ 来自flit, 掠过，轻掠。或直接来自辅音丛bl, fl, 折腾，拍打，拟声词，词源同flap, flabby,flag. 插入字母r, 延长音，模仿调情的声音。

.fathom
(v.)/ˈfæðəm/ (=~ sb/sth (out) : to understand or find an explanation for sth 理解；彻底了解；弄清真相;/英寻（测量水深单位，合6英尺或1.8米）

受害者可能会因为一些原因, 而不报告他们的苦难经历，比如感到尴尬, 或认为这无济于事。他们可能因为工作原因, 而继续与袭击者保持联系。他们可能会与他调情, 或再次与他发生性关系，以此来重新获得或建立对他们关系的控制感。

陪审员可能会发现这很难理解。辩护律师则会利用他们的这种困惑。在针对温斯坦的指控浮出水面后不久，两名“纽约时报”(New York Times)记者披露，温斯坦当时的律师丽莎·布鲁姆(Lisa Bloom), 曾试图安抚他的公司董事会成员，称一些照片将很快公布, 在这些照片上, “几名原告在指控哈维行为不当后，还摆着非常友好的姿势, 与他在一起”。 +
当一段原告试图想隐瞒的关系, 被这些证据暴露出来后, 这种披露可能是有意义的. 然而，仅仅是受害者与犯罪者拥有这样一段持续的关系, 这一事实本身并不能说明什么。

==== <pure> Why so few rapists are convicted


Rape is one of the hardest crimes to prosecute. After a murder, there is a corpse. After a rape, by contrast, there may be no physical evidence at all. Often, 主 the only evidence that a crime has even occurred 系 is the word of the victim, flatly contradicted by the defendant. When it is essentially her word against his, it can be extremely difficult to prove [beyond reasonable doubt] that the accuser is telling the truth and the defendant is lying. It is doubly so [when the general public  — and therefore jurors — have deep misconceptions about what a typical rape looks like, and what a credible allegation sounds like].

主 Many people faced with these two accounts 谓 will find Joe’s more credible. People often think of rape as involving things (conspicuously missing  from Jane’s account): a predatory stranger, a weapon used to threaten or hurt, a secluded location and a victim anxious to report the crime [straight away]. They are mistaken. “Most common knowledge about sexual assault is wrong,” said Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist.

Many reports are made long after the event; 主 more than a quarter of attacks reported in England and Wales in 2017 谓 took place over a year before. 主 Some 80% of rapes (reported) 谓 are committed by a person (known to the victim).

Sexual assault typically involves neither weapons nor visible injuries. The 2017 Crime Survey for England and Wales found the most common location to be the victim’s home (39%) and the second most common the offender’s home (24%). Just 10% happen in a public place such as a park or the street. 主 Nearly a third of people claiming to be the victims of rape 谓 said {they told no one}; over half told an acquaintance; fewer than one in five told the police.

Victims may not report their ordeal for a number of reasons, such as embarrassment or thinking it will not help. They may remain in contact with their assailant for work reasons. They may flirt with him or have sex with him again as a way to regain, or establish, a sense of control over their relationship.

Jurors can find this hard to fathom. Defence lawyers exploit their confusion. [Soon after allegations against Mr Weinstein surfaced] 主 two New York Times reporters 谓 revealed {how 主 Mr Weinstein’s then lawyer, Lisa Bloom, 谓 had tried to reassure board members of his company by saying 主 photographs 谓 would soon be published of “several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct”}. When such evidence reveals a continued relationship that the accuser has sought to hide, it can be relevant. 主 The mere fact of a continued relationship, though, 谓 says little.

The absence of a weapon; missing, imprecise or mistaken memories; delayed reporting; prior acquaintance; claims of consent — they all make a rape complaint more likely to be dismissed by investigators, even though they are extremely common.

And by the fact that 主 Mr Weinstein 谓 doesn’t look like George Clooney, adds Bennett Capers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School. [If Joe is good-looking] both men and women are more likely to believe him than if he is not.
