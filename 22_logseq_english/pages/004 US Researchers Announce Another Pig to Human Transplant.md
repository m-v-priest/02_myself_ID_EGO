	- American doctors have released details about another operation involving the transplant of pig organs into humans.
	- A medical team from the University of Alabama at Birmingham said it had successfully transplanted pig kidneys into a brain-dead human. The operation took place last September, but was first reported January 20.
	- Similar operations have taken place in recent months.
	- In October, doctors at New York University temporarily attached a pig kidney to blood vessels outside the body of a brain-dead human. And earlier this month, doctors at University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore transplanted a pig heart into a living human patient.
	- In all of the operations, doctors used organs from genetically modified pigs provided by Virginia-based medical company Revivicor.
	- The latest experiment in Alabama was performed on 57-year-old Jim Parsons, who was declared brain-dead after being injured in a motorcycle accident. His family donated his body to science.
	- For a little more than three days -- until the man’s body was removed from life support -- the two pig kidneys survived with no signs of immediate rejection, the medical team reported. The results were recently published in a study in the American Journal of Transplantation.
	- Dr. Jayme Locke of the University of Alabama at Birmingham led the new study. She told The Associated Press the experiment marks the beginning of a planned series of pig kidney transplants.
	- “The organ shortage is in fact an unmitigated crisis, and we’ve never had a real solution to it,” Locke said.
	- She added that an important finding of the latest operation helped answer a major question: Could the pig kidney blood vessels survive the force of human blood pressure? She said the operation proved that the answer was yes.
	- One kidney was damaged during removal from the pig and did not work effectively, the team reported. But the other quickly started producing urine as a kidney is supposed to.
	- Locke said no pig viruses were passed on to the human, and no pig cells were found in the man’s bloodstream. She added that the latest experiment showed that brain-dead bodies can serve as much-needed human models to test out possible new treatments.
	- In the donor pigs, scientists removed several genes linked to organ rejection. They also removed another gene in an effort to prevent too much growth of pig heart tissue.
	- Dr. Robert Montgomery has led similar experiments at New York University’s Langone Health in New York City. He told the AP that scientists still have a lot to learn about how long pig organs survive, and how best to genetically change them. “I think different organs will require different genetic modifications,” he said.
	- Organ donor organizations estimate there are about 110,000 Americans currently waiting for an organ transplant. And more than 6,000 patients die each year before getting an organ, reports organdonor.gov.
