	- Medical experts say the only way to know for sure if you have the common cold, flu or COVID-19 is to get a test because symptoms can be similar.
	- The flu and COVID-19 have common symptoms, such as cough, fever, tiredness and muscle soreness. The viruses can all spread before people know they are sick.
	- Many people who have COVID-19 do not feel sick but they can still spread the virus.
	- Important differences
	- The main difference with COVID-19 is people sometimes lose their ability to smell and taste.
	- With flu, fevers are more common.
	- With colds, people usually have throat pain or nasal congestion.
	- The viruses are separate. It is, however, possible to become sick with more than one at the same time.
	- Some people are calling the combination of flu and COVID-19 “flurona.”
	- Kristen Coleman is an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. She said the number of people with flu and COVID-19 will increase in the coming weeks and months as the northern hemisphere enters flu season.
	- Testing is the best way to find out which virus you have.
	- While tests are in short supply in some parts of the world, Coleman said the best way to find out is to visit a pharmacy, where you can be tested for both flu and COVID-19 at the same time.
	- As soon as you know which illness you have, doctors can help with treatment.
	- Coleman said that in normal times, laboratories can find out if you have the common cold. However, right now, most are focused on testing for COVID-19.
	- One way to reduce your chances of having a problem with flu and COVID is to get vaccinated, experts say. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is safe to get the flu vaccine and a third COVID-19 shot, or booster, at the same time.
