King Juan Carlos of Spain *once insisted* 坚持, 强调 ｛kings *don't abdicate* 退位;逊位,  they *die* in their sleep｝. But {① embarrassing scandals and ② the popularity 受歡迎；普及；流行 of the republican left 左翼 in the recent Euro-elections} *have forced* him *to eat his words* 收回前言；承認說錯 and *stand down* (从重要职位上)退下, 下台(常为了让位给别人).
====
- *eat your words* ： to admit that what you said was wrong收回前言；承認說錯
====

So,  主 *does* the Spanish crisis 谓 *suggest*(`=to state sth indirectly`) that {monarchy 君主政体;君主制 *is seeing* its last days？ Does that mean *the writing is on the wall* 凶兆毕现; 有大难临头的预兆 for all European royals 王室的, 伴随状语 with their magnificent(`=extremely attractive and impressive`) uniforms and majestic(`=impressive because of size or beauty`) lifestyles 生活方式？}
====
- *The writing/Finger on the Wall* 不详之兆；大祸临头 : 这个成语的字面意思是“墙上的文字或手指”, 而实际含义是 a sign or warning of *impending disaster* 迫在眉睫的凶兆；a sign that *sth bad will happen*; a feeling that *ones number is up*；等等。

- magnificent : ADJ If you say that something or someone is magnificent, you mean that *you think they are extremely good, beautiful, or impressive*. 出色的; 壮丽的 +
=> magni-,巨大的, -fic,做, 制造。引申词义伟大, 壮观, 辉煌。

- majestic :ADJ If you describe something or someone as majestic, *you think they are very beautiful, dignified, and impressive*. 壮丽的; 雄伟的 +
=>  -magn- →maj大的 + es + -tic形容词词尾

西班牙国王胡安·卡洛斯曾经坚持“国王不会退位, 他们在睡梦中死去”。但是就在最近的欧洲选举中, 尴尬的丑闻, 和民众对共和党人的支持, 迫使他不得不收回其说过的话, 并宣布退位。
西班牙的这次危机是否预示君主制已经走到了尽头？这是否对所有欧洲皇室以及他们的锦衣华服和高贵的生活方式都是不祥之兆。


The Spanish case *provides* arguments [both *for* 支持 and *against* 反对 monarchy(`=a system of government by a king or a queen`)] when public opinion *is particularly Polarized*(`=to separate or make people separate into two groups with completely opposite opinions`), [插入语,方式状从 as 正如 it *was following* the end of the France regime(`=a method or system of government, especially one that has not been elected in a fair way`)],  monarchs 君主 *can* ① *rise above* “mere 仅仅, 纯粹的” politics and ② “ *embody*(`=to express or represent an idea or a quality`)” a spirit of national unity 团结；一致.
====
- *as* it was following the end of the Franco regime : 是由as引导的方式状语从句, 根据就近原则修饰前面的时间状语从句, 而且由两个逗号隔开, 属插入语
====

西班牙的这个事件, 为支持和反对君主制都提供了论据。当公众的观念呈现极端的两级分化时, 正如佛朗哥政权结束之后, 君主制都能够超脱旧有的范畴, 不“仅仅”是政治, 而且成为“代表”国家团结的精神。


*It is* this apparent transcendence(n.)超越 of politics *that* *explains* monarchs' 君主 continuing(a.) popularity 受歡迎；普及；流行 *as* heads of states.
====
- It is ... that... 强调句
- transcendence :N-UNCOUNT Transcendence is *the quality* of *being able to go beyond normal limits* or boundaries. 超越
====

And so, the Middle East excepted(a.) 除外的；除…之外, Europe *is* the most *monarch-infested* 遍布于;充斥 region in the world, *with* 10 kingdoms (*not counting* 计算, 包括…在内 Vatican 梵蒂冈 city and Andorra 安道尔共和国法国和西班牙交界处).
====
- infest : V-T When creatures such as insects or rats infest plants or a place, *they are present in large numbers and cause damage*. (昆虫或老鼠等) 大批出没于
====

But *unlike* their absolutist 绝对论者；专制主义者 counterparts 职能(或地位)相当的人;对应的事物 in the Gulf 波斯湾；海湾地区 and Asia,  most royal families *have survived* because they *allow* voters *to avoid* the difficult search for a non-controversial 不會引起爭議的；一致的 but respect public figure 公众人物.

正是这种对政治的超脱, 解释了为何今日君主作为国家首脑, 仍然持续受到大众的拥戴。而且不论中东地区, 欧洲是世界上君主政权最多的地区, 拥有十个王国还没加上梵蒂冈和安道尔。
但与海湾地区和亚洲额君主的专制不同, 大多数皇室得以幸存, 是由于他们的存在使选民无需幸苦的寻找一位不受争议却受人尊敬的公众人物。

Even so 虽然如此, 即使如此,  kings and queens undoubtedly *have* a downside(`=the disadvantages or less positive aspects of sth`).

[让步状从 symbolic(a.)(`=containing symbols, or being used as a symbol`) of national unity *as they claim to be*],  their very 与名词连用, 强调重要性或严重性仅仅的, 唯独的, 甚至于, 就连 history —— and sometimes the way (they *behave* today) —— *embodies*(`=to express or represent an idea or a quality`) outdated 过时的；旧式的 and indefensible(`=that cannot be defended or excused because it is morally unacceptable`) privileges and inequalities(`=the unfair difference between groups of people in society, when some have more wealth, status or opportunities than others`).
====
- Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be : 是由as引导的让步状语从句, 是部分倒装结构, 正常语序为 as they claim to be symbolic of national unity, 修饰主句。

- symbolic : ADJ If you describe an event, action, or procedure as symbolic, you mean that *it represents an important change*, although it has little practical effect. 有象征意义的

- very : adj. used *to emphasize that you are talking about a particular thing* or person *and not about another* 特指人或事物正是的, 恰好的, 同一的 +
-> Those were *her very words*. 这些都是她的原话。 +
-> That's *the very thing* I need. 那正是我需要的东西。
====

At a time (when Thomas Piketty and other economists *are warning of* 警告某人某事 ① rising inequality 不平等, 不均等 and ② the increasing power of inherited 通过继承得到的,遗传的 wealth),  *it is* bizarre(`=very strange or unusual`) {*that* wealthy(a.)(`=having a lot of money, possessions, etc`) aristocratic 贵族的；贵族式的 families *should still be* the symbolic heart of modern democratic states}.
====
- bizarre : ADJ Something that is bizarre is *very odd and strange*. 怪异的 +
=> 原起源于德国兵留胡子, 在西班牙的居民表示奇怪。故起源于beard 胡子。
====

虽然如此, 国王和女王无疑有其不利的一面。他们声称代表了国家团结, 但他们的历史以及现在时不时的举止, 都代表了过时且站不住脚的特权和不平等, 
在当今的时代——这个托马斯·匹克提和其他经济学家所警示的, 存在日益严重的不平等和继承财富积聚的权利的时代——富裕的贵族家庭仍是现代民主国家的精神代表, 这件事不免令人嗔怪。

The most successful monarchies 君主制国家, 君主制 *strive*  *to abandon* or *hide* their old aristocratic 贵族的; 贵族气派的 ways. Prince and princess *have* day-jobs 正职 and *ride* bicycles,  not horses or helicopters 直升机. Even so,  these *are* wealthy families (who *party 参加社交聚会 with* the international 1%),  and media intrusiveness 干涉性；侵扰性；侵入性 *makes* it increasingly difficult *to maintain* the right image(`=the impression that a person, an organization or a product, etc. gives to the public`).
====
- aristocratic +
=> Aristo贵族, crat=rule,ruler,表示"统治或政体,统治者", ic形容词化
====

最成功的君主们仍努力丢下或遮掩旧有的贵族范儿：公主和王储白天得工作, 他们骑自行车, 而不是骏马或直升机。即使如此, 他们仍然是那些与全世界顶尖的1%交际的富人阶层, 无孔不入的媒体让他们很难维持正确的形象。

While虽然 Europe's monarchies 君主国 *will* no doubt *be* smart enough *to survive*(`=to continue to live or exist despite a dangerous event or time`) for some time (to come),  *it is* the British royals *who* have most *to fear* [from the Spanish example].
- 最后, It is... who... 强调句

虽然聪明的欧洲皇室无疑在将来的一点时间仍能幸存, 但是从西班牙这个例子中, 最应感到恐慌的应该是英国贵族。

It is only the Queen who *has preserved*(`=to keep a particular quality, feature, etc.; to make sure that sth is kept`) the monarchy’s reputation *with* her rather ordinary (if well-heeled) granny(`=grandmother`) style. The danger *will come with* 与…一起供给；伴随…发生；从…开始 Charles, who has *both* an expensive taste of lifestyle *and* a pretty hierarchical 等级制度的;等级森严的 view of the world.
====
- hierarchical：hier神圣的, archy统治－神圣的统治－阶层；等级制度
====

He *has failed* *to understand* that {monarchies *have largely 大致上；总体上；一般地说 survived* because they *provide* a service —— *as* non-controversial 不會引起爭議的；一致的 and non-political 非政治性的 heads of state}. Charles *ought* 应该 *to know* that {*as* English history *shows*, ｛*it is* kings, not republicans 共和主义者, *who* are the monarchy’s worst enemies｝｝.
====
- 最后, It is... who... 强调句
====

女王以她平易近人的奶奶风格, 虽然颇为考究保住了皇室的声誉, 但生活品味奢侈、并且看待世界有些等级歧视的查尔斯, 将会给英国皇室带来危险。他不明白君主制得以延续, 是因为君主扮演了不受争议、无党派的国家元首角色。查尔斯应该知道, 就像英国历史所表明的, 君主制的最大敌人不是共和党人, 而是国王。

King Juan Carlos of Spain *once insisted* “kings *don’t abdicate*, they *die* in their sleep.” ② But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections *have forced* him *to eat his words* and *stand down*. ③ So, *does* the Spanish crisis *suggest* that monarchy *is seeing* its last days? Does that *mean* the writing *is* on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyle?

The Spanish case *provides* arguments both *for* and *against* monarchy. ② When public opinion *is particularly polarised*, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs *can rise above* “mere” politics and "*embody*" a spirit of national unity.

*It is* this apparent transcendence of politics *that* explains monarchs’ continuing popularity polarized. ② And also, the Middle East excepted, Europe *is* the most monarch-infested region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (*not counting* Vatican City and Andorra). ③ But unlike their absolutist counterparts in the Gulf and Asia, most royal families *have survived* because they *allow* voters *to avoid* the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure.

Even so, kings and queens *undoubtedly have* a downside. ② Symbolic of national unity *as they claim to be*, their very history -- and sometimes the way they *behave* today -- *embodies* outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. ③ At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists *are warning of* rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, *it is* bizarre *that* wealthy aristocratic families *should still be* the symbolic heart of modern democratic states.

The most successful monarchies *strive to abandon or hide* their old aristocratic ways. ② Princes and princesses *have* day-jobs and *ride* bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). ③ Even so, these *are* wealthy families who *party with* the international 1%, and media intrusiveness *makes* it increasingly difficult *to maintain* the right image.

While Europe’s monarchies *will no doubt be* smart enough *to survive* for some time to come, *it is* the British royals *who* have most *to fear* from the Spanish example.

It is only the Queen who *has preserved* the monarchy’s reputation *with* her rather ordinary (if well-heeled) granny style. ② The danger *will come with* Charles, who *has* both an expensive taste of lifestyle and a pretty hierarchical view of the world. ③ He *has failed to understand* that monarchies *have largely survived* because they *provide* a service -- *as* non-controversial and non-political heads of state. ④ Charles *ought to know* that *as* English history *shows*, it is kings, not republicans, who *are* the monarchy’s worst enemies.

Just how much *does* the Constitution 宪法 *protect* your digital data? The Supreme Court *will* now *consider* {whether police *can search* the contents of a mobile phone *without* a warrant 搜查令;拘捕令；令状 if the phone *is* on or around a person during an arrest}.

California *has asked* the justices 法官 *to refrain from*(`=to stop yourself from doing sth, especially sth that you want to do`) a sweeping(`=too general and failing to think about or understand particular examples`) ruling (法官或法院作出的)裁决, 裁定 particularly one (that *upsets*(`=to make a plan, situation, etc. go wrong`) the old assumption(`=a belief or feeling that sth is true or that sth will happen, although there is no proof`) (that authorities 当局,官方 *may search through* the possessions of suspects 嫌疑犯 [at the time of their arrest])).

It *is* hard, the state *argues*, for judges {*to assess*(`=to make a judgement about the nature or quality of sb/sth`) the implications(`=a possible effect or result of an action or a decision`) of new and rapidly changing technologies}.

宪法对你的电子数据到底保护了多少? 现在最高法院正在考量, 能否在没有搜查令的情况下, 看一部在抓捕现场获取的手机。
加利福尼亚州告诉法官, 不要做任何包括行的判断, 尤其是不要推翻旧有的假定——权利机关可以在逮捕时搜查嫌疑人的所有物品, 加利福尼亚州说: 让法官评定快速发展的新技术的影响, 是很困难的。

The court *would be* recklessly(`=showing a lack of care about danger and the possible results of your actions`) modest 谦虚的;谦逊的 [if it *followed* California’s advice]. Enough of the implications *are* discernable 可辨别的,可认识的, even obvious, *so that* the justices *can* and *should provide* updated guidelines *to* police, lawyers and defendants 被告代理人.

如果法院遵循了加利福尼亚州的建议, 他们就是不一般的谦虚了。(法院对是否采取吉利福尼亚的建议表示非常谨慎if在这里翻译为是否, recklessly不顾一切, 表示程度)
很多影响是可辨识得, 甚至是显而易见的, 所以, 法官应该必须向警察、律师和被告们, 提供新的指导规则。

They *should start* [by *discarding* California’s lame 瘸的, 站不住脚的 argument(`=a reason or set of reasons that sb uses to show that sth is true or correct`) (that {主 *exploring* 探测；探索 the contents of a smart phone —— a vast(`=extremely large`) storehouse(`=a building where things are stored`) of digital information} —— 系 *is similar to*, say, 表 *rifling(`=to search quickly through sth`) through* a suspect’s purse 钱包.}]


The court *has ruled* 判定;裁定 that ｛police *don’t violate* the Fourth Amendment when they *sift 筛(面粉、沙子等)；细查;详审 through* the wallet or pocketbook 女用手提包 of an arrestee 被捕者 *without* a warrant｝. But {*exploring* one’s smart phone} *is* more like {*entering* his or her home}.

A smart phone *may contain* an arrestee’s reading history, financial history, medical history and comprehensive(`=includes everything`) records of recent correspondence(`=the activity of writing letters`). The development of “cloud computing 云计算,” meanwhile, *has made* that exploration so much the easier.


他们应该首先放弃杰利弗尼亚州蹩脚的论点——搜查储存了大量电子信息的智能手机等同于翻查嫌疑人的钱包。
法院曾判决, 警察在没有搜查令的情况下, 搜查嫌疑人的钱包或皮夹, 并不融犯宪法第四修正案。但是搜查智能手机, 更像闯入一个人的家中。智能手机可能包含了嫌疑人的阅读、财务、医疗, 以及最新联系人的大量记录。同时, 云计算技术, 更使得这种探究轻而易举。

Americans *should take* steps *to protect* their digital privacy. But 主{ *keeping* sensitive(`=that you have to treat with great care because it may offend people or make them angry`) information on these devices(`=an object or a piece of equipment that has been designed to do a particular job`)} *系is* increasingly a requirement(`=something that you must have in order to do sth else`) of normal life.

Citizens 市民；公民 still *have* a right (*to expect* private documents ① *to remain* private and ② *protected* [by the Constitution’s prohibition(`=a law or a rule that stops sth being done or used`)] on unreasonable searches).
====
- If you expect something, or expect a person to do something, you believe that *it is your right to have that thing*, or the person's duty to do it for you.
====

美国人应该采取行动, 来保护数字隐私。但将敏感信息保存在这些设备上, 越来越成为正常生活的需要。公民们仍有权期待个人文件的私密性受到宪法的保活, 免于受到没有根据的搜查。


*As so often is the case*情况常常如此, 这是常有的事, { *stating*(`=to formally write or say sth, especially in a careful and clear way`) that principle} *doesn’t ease*(`=to make sth less unpleasant, painful, severe`) the challenge of line-drawing(`=a drawing which consists only of lines`). In many cases, it *would not be* overly(`=too; very`) onerous(`=needing great effort; causing trouble or worry`) {*for* authorities *to obtain* a warrant *to search through* phone contents}.

They *could* still *invalidate*(`=you make it no longer legally or officially valid or acceptable`) Fourth Amendment protections 保护法；保护条例；保护措施 [when *facing* severe(`=extremely bad or serious`), urgent circumstances], and they could *take* reasonable measures *to ensure* that phone data *are not erased*(`=to remove sth completely`) or *altered* [while a warrant *is* pending(`=waiting to be decided or settled`)].

The court, though 不过;可是;然而, may want *to allow room(`=the possibility of sth existing or happening; the opportunity to do sth`) for* police *to cite*(`=to mention sth as a reason or an example`) situations (where they *are entitled(`=to give sb the right to have or to do sth`) to* more freedom).


但情况往往是, 强调原则并不能淡化分界这个棘手的挑战, 在大多数情况下, 相关当局为搜查手机内容而申请搜查令, 会非常繁琐。他们任然可以在一些严重紧急的情况下, 无视第四修正案, 他们可以在搜查令的审批过程中, 采取合理的措施, 来保证手机数据没有被删除或者篡改。但是法院可能想给警察更多的机会, 来引证那些他们拥有更多权限时的情况。

But the justices *should not swallow*(`=to accept that sth is true; to believe sth`) California’s argument [whole]. New, disruptive(a.)(`=causing problems, noise, etc`) technology sometimes *demands* novel(`=different from anything known before; new, interesting and often seeming slightly strange`) applications 应用；运用 of the Constitution’s protections.
====
- disruptive +
=> rupt=break , rupt来源于ripe成熟, 成熟的时候容易发生爆裂。

Orin Kerr, a law professor, *compares* 比较;对比;相比 the explosion and accessibility 易接近,可到达 of digital information in the 21st century *with* the establishment of automobile (*use as* a virtual 几乎的;实际上的;事实上的 necessity 必需品 of life in the 20th): The justices *had to specify*(`=to state sth, especially by giving an exact measurement, time, exact instructions, etc`) novel rules [for the new personal domain 领域, 范围, 范畴 of the passenger car] then; they *must sort out*(`=to organize the contents of sth; to tidy sth. / to organize sth successfully`) {how the Fourth Amendment *applies to* digital information now}.


但是法官不应该全盘接受加州的说法。新的破坏性的技术, 有时候要求新颖的应用宪法保护。法学教授奥因·科尔认为, 21世纪电子信息的爆炸与易用性, 和20世纪汽车成为生活必需品是一样的。当时, 法官必须就轿车这个新时代的个人领域制定新的规则, 而现在, 他们应该想想第四修正案应该怎样应用在点自信心上。

The journal Science *is adding* an extra round 一连串, 一系列, 一轮(相关的事件, 尤指相继发生的事件) of statistical 统计的;统计学的 checks *to* its peer-review process, editor-in-chief (组织机构的)负责人, 头儿, 首领 Marcia McNutt announced today.

The policy *follows* similar efforts (from other journals), after widespread concern that {basic mistakes (in data analysis分析) *are contributing 促成;促使；是导致…的原因之一 to* the irreproducibility 非再生性 (of many published research findings)}.


《科学》杂志的总编辑玛西娅·迈克诺特, 今天宣布《科学》将在同行评审流程中, 加入一个新的统计检查环节。这个政策, 之前已有其他期刊采取了相似的举动, 因为很多人担忧, 数据分析的基本错误正导致许多刊登的研究结果无法被再现。


“Readers must *have confidence in* the conclusions (published in our journal),” *writes* McNutt [in an editorial 报纸的社论].

[*Working with* the American Statistical 统计的;统计学的 Association], the journal *has appointed*(`=to choose sb for a job or position of responsibility`) seven experts *to* a statistics 统计学 board 用于机构名称中局, 所, 中心, 委员会 of *reviewing*(`=to carefully examine or consider sth again`) editors(SBoRE).

Manuscript 手稿;原稿 *will be flagged 標示重要處 up*(`=to draw attention to sth`) [目的状 for additional scrutiny(n.)(`=careful and thorough examination`)] [by ①the journal’s internal 机构内部的 editors, or by ②its existing Board of Reviewing Editors or by ③outside peer(n.)(`=a person who is the same age or who has the same social status as you`) reviewers].
====
- scrutiny : => scrut,scrutin=search 表示"检查",  tiny微小的 。→检查微小的必须「细看」
====

The SBoRE panel 进行公开讨论或作决策的专门小组 will then *find* external statisticians 统计学家, 统计员 *to review* these manuscripts.


“读者必须对刊登在我们杂志上的结论有信心”。迈克诺特在一篇结论中写到。《科学》与美国统计分析协会合作, 任命了七名专家组成统计审查编辑委员会SBoRE。杂志的编辑或现有的评审委员会, 或者外部的同行评审者, 会把引起注意的文章提交额外审查, 而统计从审查编辑委员会, 则会找到外部专家去复审这些文章。
投稿人的原稿也会被标出需要经过额外的仔细审查, 或由杂志内部编辑, 或由现有的编辑评审委员会, 或由外部的同行评审人员。

Asked ｛whether any particular papers 论文 *had impelled*(`=it affects you so strongly that you feel forced to do it`) the change｝, McNutt said: “The creation of the ‘statistics board’ ① *was motivated [by* concerns (broadly(`=generally, without considering details`) with ① the application(`=the practical use of sth`) of statistics and ② data analysis in scientific research)] and ② *is* part of Science’s overall 总的；总体的；全面的 drive(n.)驱动;推动；(为达到某目的而进行的)努力,运动 (*to increase* reproducibility 重复能力,再现性 [in the research (we *publish*)]).”

当被问及是否是谋篇文章引发了这种改变, 迈克诺特说：“统计委员会的成立, 是由统计学和数据分析在科学研究领域的关注推动的；是《科学》提高出版研究成果可在现性的全面行动的一部分。”

Giovanni Parmigiani, a biostatistician 生物统计学家 at the Harvard School of Public Health, a member of the SBoRE group. He says {he *expects* the board *to “play* [primarily(`=mainly`)] an advisory(`=having the role of giving professional advice`) role.”}

He *agreed* to join [because he “*found* the foresight(`=the ability to predict what is likely to happen`) (behind the establishment(`=the act of starting or creating sth that is meant to last for a long time`) of the SBoRE) ① *to be* novel(`=different from anything known before; new, interesting and often seeming slightly strange`), unique and ② likely *to have* a lasting impact].

This impact will *not only* be through 穿过,通过 the publications (in Science itself), *but* hopefully through 穿过,通过 a larger group of publishing places that may *want to model*(`=to make sth so that it looks, works, etc. like sth else`) their approach 方法 *after* Science <科学>杂志名.”
====
- *model(v.) sth on/after sth* : to make sth so that it looks, works, etc. like sth else 模仿；仿照 +
-> The country's parliament *is modelled(v.) on the British system*. 这个国家的议会是模仿英国的体制建立的。

- *model(v.) yourself on sb* : to copy the behaviour, style, etc. of sb you like and respect in order to be like them 仿效；以某人为榜样
====

哈佛公共卫生学院的生物统计学家乔凡尼·帕尔米贾尼, 是统计审查编辑委员会的一员, 他说, 希望委员会仅仅扮演咨询建议的角色。他同意加入, 因为他“发现, 建立统计审查编辑委员会的预见很新颖和独特, 并可能有长久的影响, 这种影响将来不仅会通过《科学》杂志的出版物作用, 还会通过更多的想要效仿《科学》的出版商起作用”

John Ioannidis, a physician 医生, 内科医生 (who *studies* research methodology(`=a set of methods and principles used to perform a particular activity`)), *says* that {the policy *is* ①“a most welcome step (forward)” and ②“long overdue(a.)(`=that should have happened or been done before now`).”} “Most journals 学术期刊 *are* weak(`=not physically strong`) [in statistical review], and this *damages* the quality of what they publish.
====
- long overdue : 珊珊来迟
====

I *think* that, [for the majority of scientific papers (nowadays)], statistical review is *more* essential(`=completely necessary; extremely important`) *than* expert review,” he says.

But he *noted*(`=to notice or pay careful attention to sth`) that {biomedical (有关)生物医学的 journals (such as ① Annals of Internal Medicine 内科医学, 内科, ②the Journal of the American Medical Association and ③ The Lancet 醫生用的柳葉刀, 小刀) *pay strong attention to* statistical review}.


研究研究方法学的约翰说, 这个政策是“向前迈出的受人欢迎的一步”,  也是“姗姗来迟的一步”。他表示, “大多数期刊在统计审查上, 都很薄弱, 这会破坏他们的出版质量。我认为, 对于当下的大部分科学论文来说, 统计审查, 比专家审查更为必要“。但是他也注意到, 一些生物医学期刊, 如《内科年鉴》、《美国医学协会期刊》和《柳叶刀》, 对于统计审查十分重视。

Professional scientists *are* expected(`=to demand that sb will do sth because it is their duty or responsibility`) *to know* how *to analyze*(`=to examine the nature or structure of sth, especially by separating it into its parts, in order to understand or explain it`) data, but statistical errors *are* alarmingly(`=causing worry and fear`) common [in published research], according to David Vaux, a cell biologist.

Researchers *should improve* their standards, he *wrote* in 2012, but journals *should* also *take a tougher(`=demanding that particular rules be obeyed and showing a lack of sympathy for any problems or suffering that this may cause`) line*, “*engaging*(`=to take part in sth; to make sb take part in sth`) ① reviewers who *are* statistically 统计上地,统计地 literate(a.)受过良好教育的；熟练的；通晓的 and ② editors who *can verify*(`=to check that sth is true or accurate`) the process”.

Vaux *says* that {Science’s idea (*to pass* 递；传递 some papers *to* statisticians) *has* some merit(`=the quality of being good and of deserving praise, reward or admiration`), but a weakness, 不足 *is* that {it *relies on* the board of reviewing editors *to identify*(`=to recognize sb/sth and be able to say who or what they are`) the papers (that *need* scrutinyn(`=studied or observed very carefully`) [in the first place 首先；起初,从一开始])}}.

职业科学家应该知道如何分析数据, 但是细胞生物学家大卫·沃克斯发现, 出版的研究中, 存在惊人的统计错误。他在2012年写到, 研究者应该提高他们的水平, 但是期刊也应该更加严格“使懂统计的评审专家, 能够验证此过程的编辑加入”。
沃克斯认为, 《科学》的把一些论文交给统计专家的想法, 有些好处, 但是存在一个弱点：他首先要依赖评审编辑, 去识别需要额外审查的论文。

The journal Science *is adding* an extra round of statistical checks *to* its peer-review process, editor-in-chief Marcia McNutt *announced* today. ② The policy *follows* similar efforts from other journals, after widespread concern that basic mistakes in data analysis *are contributing to* the irreproducibility of many published research findings.

“Readers *must have confidence in* the conclusions *published* in our journal,” *writes* McNutt in an editorial. ② *Working with* the American Statistical Association, the journal *has appointed* seven experts *to* a statistics board of reviewing editors(SBoRE). ③ Manuscript *will be flagged up* for additional scrutiny by the journal’s internal editors, or by its existing Board of Reviewing Editors or by outside peer reviewers. ④ The SBoRE panel *will then find* external statisticians *to review* these manuscripts.

*Asked* whether any particular papers *had impelled* the change, McNutt said: “The creation of the ‘statistics board’ *was motivated by* concerns *broadly with* the application of statistics and data analysis in scientific research /and *is part of* Science’s overall drive *to increase* reproducibility in the research we *publish*.”

Giovanni Parmigiani, a biostatistician at the Harvard School of Public Health, a member of the SBoRE group. He *says* he *expects* the board *to “play* primarily an advisory role.” ② He *agreed to join* because he “*found* the foresight (behind the establishment of the SBoRE) *to be* novel, unique and *likely to have* a lasting impact. ③ This impact *will not only* be through the publications in Science itself, *but* hopefully through a larger group of publishing places that *may want to model* their approach *after* Science.”

John Ioannidis, a physician who *studies* research methodology, *says* that the policy *is* “a most welcome step forward” and “long overdue.” ② “Most journals *are* weak in statistical review, and this *damages* the quality of what they publish. ③ I *think* that, for the majority of scientific papers nowadays, statistical review *is* more essential than expert review,” he says. ④ But he *noted* that `主` biomedical journals such as Annals of Internal Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet `谓` *pay strong attention to* statistical review.

Professional scientists *are expected to know* how *to analyze* data, but statistical errors *are* alarmingly common in published research, according to David Vaux, a cell biologist. ② Researchers *should improve* their standards, he wrote in 2012, but journals *should also take* a tougher line, “*engaging* reviewers who *are* statistically literate /and editors who *can verify* the process”. ③ Vaux *says* that `主` Science’s idea *to pass* some papers *to* statisticians `谓` “*has* some merit, but a weakness *is* that it *relies on* the board of reviewing editors *to identify* ‘the papers that *need* scrutiny’ in the first place”.

## 2015-04.

Two years ago, Rupert Murdoch’s daughter ,Elisabeth, *spoke of* 谈到；论及 the “unsettling(`=makes you feel worried or uncertain`) dearth of integrity 正直;诚实 across(`=in every part of a place, group of people, etc`) so many of our institutions”.
② Integrity *had collapsed*, she *argued*(`=to give reasons why you think that sth is right/wrong, true/not true, etc`), because of `主` a collective(`=done or shared by all members of a group of people`) acceptance (同位语从句 that the only “*sorting 把…分类;整理 mechanism* 分类机制;排序机制” in society `谓` *should be* profit(`=the money that you make in business or by selling things`) and the market). ③ But “it’s us, human beings, we the people who *create* the society we want, not profit ”.
====
- a collective acceptance：一个共同的接受, 实际上指的就是“人们普遍认为”。
- Collective :a. actions, situations, or feelings *involve or are shared by every member* of a group of people.
====

两年前, 鲁伯特·默多克的女儿曾说起, “我们众多机构诚信缺失, 这令人不安”。她说, 诚信已经破产, 因为我们集体接受的分层级制, 是利润和市场。然而“是我们——是人类创造我们想要的社会, 而不是利润。“

*Driving* her point [(ad.)*home* （言语等）正中要害，说到点子上], she *continued*: “*It*’s increasingly apparent *that* 主 the absence of purpose, of a moral language (within 在…里 government, media or business) 谓 *could become* one of the most dangerous goals *for* capitalism 资本主义(制度) and freedom.”
====
- *drive(v.) sth. home* : If you *press, drive, or hammer(v.) something [(ad.)home]*, you explain it to people as forcefully as possible. 击中要害地;彻底地;深切地;切实地
====

This same absence of moral purpose *was wounding* 伤害, 使受伤 companies such as News International ,she *thought* ,making it more likely {that it *would lose its way* 迷失方向 (as it *had* 正如之前发生的) [伴随状 *with* widespread(a.)(`=existing or happening over a large area or among many people`) illegal 非法的；违法的 telephone hacking 尤指为获取机密信息侵入, 非法进入他人的计算机系统]}.
====
- as it had 一句, 其实省略了 lose its way.
====

为了将自己的论点讲透彻, 她继续道：“我们越来越明显的看到, 政府、媒体以及商界中的, 目标和道德语言的缺失, 会成为资本主义和自由最危险的乌龙球。“他认为, 同样, 道德目标缺失, 正在伤害像新闻国际集团这样的企业, 令企业更容易走向歧途, 就像新闻国际的大范围电话窃听事件一样。

As the hacking trial 审判 *concludes* 推断出;断定 —— ① *finding(v.)裁决;判决;判定 guilty* one ex-editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, for *conspiring*(v.)(`=to secretly plan with other people to do sth illegal or harmful`) *to hack* phones ,and ② *finding* 裁决;判决;判定  his predecessor(`=a person who did a job before sb else`), Rebekah Brooks, 宾补 innocent of the same charge(n.)(`=an official claim made by the police that sb has committed a crime`) —— the wider issue of dearth of integrity *still stands*.
====
- find sb. guilty 认为某人有罪
- find sb. innocent 认为某人无罪
====

虽然窃听案件已经收尾——一名前《世界新闻报》的主编安迪·默尔森, 因为谋划窃听电话, 被判有罪, 而其前任利百加·布鲁克斯, 被判无罪——但是诚信缺失这个更大的问题仍然存在。

Journalists *are known* to have hacked the phones of up to 5,500 people . This is hacking on an industrial scale ,as *was acknowledged by* Glenn Mulcaire, the man *hired by* the News of the World in 2001 *to be* the point person 负责人；协调人；重点人物 for phone hacking. Others *await(v.)等候；等待 trial* 审讯;审理;审判. This long story still *unfolds*(`=to be gradually made known`).

据悉, 记者窃听了近5500人的电话。这是一次工业级别的窃听, 正如格兰·莫凯瑞所承认的那样。他2011年受聘于《世界新闻报》, 专门负责电话窃听。其他人还要等待审判。故事才刚刚开始。

In many respects, the dearth of moral purpose *frames*(v.)(`= to create and develop sth`) *not only* the fact of such widespread phone hacking *but* the terms(`=the conditions that people offer, demand or accept when they make an agreement, an arrangement or a contract`) (on which the trial *took place*) .
One of the astonishing revelations 被揭示的真相;被揭露的内情 *was* {①how little Rebekah Brooks *knew of*(`= you have heard about it but you do not necessarily have a lot of information about it`) what went on [in her newsroom (报社、广播电台的)新闻编辑室], ②how little she *thought* to ask and ③the fact (that she *never inquired* 询问;查询;打听 how the stories *arrived* 被送达；被带来)}. The core of her successful defence *was that* she knew nothing.
====
- If two people or groups compete *on equal terms* or *on the same terms*, neither of them has an advantage over the other. 在平等的条件下;在相同的基础上
====

在许多方面, 道德目标的确是不仅造成了大规模电话窃听, 而且 还成了进行审判的基础。令人惊讶的是, 利百加·布鲁克斯对自己手下的新闻编辑室, 知之甚少, 她也很少过问, 更从来没询问过报道从何而来。她成功抗辩的核心就是她一无所知。

In today’s world, it *has become* normal {that well-paid executives 主管;管理者;经理 *should not be accountable 有责任的；应作解释的 for* what *happens* in the organizations that they *run*}.

Perhaps we *should not be* so surprised. [For a generation 同时代的人, 一代人, 一代], the collective 集体的;共同的 doctrine 信条;主义;学说;尤指宗教教义 *has been* that {the sorting mechanism 排序机制, 分类机制 of society *should be* profit}.

The words (that *have mattered*(`=to be important or have an important effect on sb/sth`)) *are* 表 efficiency, flexibility, shareholder value, business–friendly 利于商界运作, wealth generation 财富的产生, 致富, sales, impact(n.) and, in newspapers, circulation(`=the usual number of copies of a newspaper or magazine that are sold each day, week, etc`).

Words *degraded(`=cause it to get worse`) to* the margin *have been* 表 justice(`= being fair or reasonable`), fairness(`=treating people equally`), tolerance, proportionality 战争、惩罚犯罪等的相称原则, 恰当性 and accountability(`=responsibility to someone`).
====
- proportionality : N-UNCOUNT The principle of proportionality is the idea that *an action should not be more severe than is necessary*, especially in a war or when punishing someone for a crime. 相称原则; 合理性 //相称性原则是指一项行动不应超过必要的程度, 特别是在战争或因犯罪而惩罚某人时。 +
-> He said there was a need for *proportionality* in sentencing. 他说量刑时应当做到罚罪相当

- *accountability(n.)有义务；有责任 system*: 问责制；责任追究制度 +
=> ac-加强意义 + -count-计算,讲故事 →账目/说明
====

在当今的世界, 高薪的执行官不为自己所运营的机构发生的事情负责, 已经成为一种常态。也许我们不应感到吃惊。
在这个时代, 盈利是社会的分层级制, 这点已经成为了集体工人的原则。效率、灵活、股东价值、商业友好、富裕世代、销售、影响以及报纸的发行量, 成了真正重要的词汇。而正义、公平、忍耐、均衡和责任感这些词, 已被边缘化了。

主 The purpose of *editing* the News of the World 系 *was not* ① *to promote* reader understanding, ② *to be fair* in what *was written* or ③ *to betray*(`=to give information about sb/sth to an enemy`) any common humanity(`=the state of being a person rather than a god, an animal or a machine 人性`). It was *to ruin* lives [目的状 *in the quest (长期艰难的)追求, 探索, 寻找 for* circulation (报纸、杂志的)发行量, 销售量 and impact].

Ms Brooks may or may not *have had suspicions 怀疑;疑心 about* how her journalists *got* their stories, but she *asked* no questions, *gave* no instructions 指示;命令—— nor *received* traceable 可追踪的,可追本溯源的;起源于, recorded answers.


《世界新闻报》编辑的目的, 已经不是提升可读性、确保报道公正客观, 或展现普遍的人性；而是为了追求发行量和影响力, 而去破坏别人的生活。
布鲁克斯女士, 可能也可能没有怀疑过手下记者的报道来源, 但她并没有问任何问题, 没有发出任何指令, 或获得任何可追踪的记录下来的回复。
