Habits are a funny thing. ② We *reach for* them mindlessly, *setting* our brains *on auto-pilot*(`=to do sth without thinking because you have done the same thing many times before`) and *relaxing into* the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. ③ “*Not* choice, *but* habit *rules*(v.) the unreflecting herd(`=a group of animals of the same type that live and feed together`),” William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. ④ In the ever-changing 不断变化的 21st century, even the word “habit” *carries* a negative connotation(`=an idea suggested by a word in addition to its main meaning 隐含意义;内涵`).

====
- automatic pilot （飞机的）自动驾驶仪；（船的）自动操舵装置;
- *BE ON AUTOMATIC PILOT* : to do sth without thinking because you have done the same thing many times before 习惯性地做；机械性地做
-  connotation : N-COUNT The connotations of a particular word or name are *the ideas or qualities which it makes you think of*. 内涵意义 +
=> 借自中世纪拉丁语connotātiō, 来自拉丁语connotō.
====

习惯是一种有趣的现象。我们无意识地养成了习惯，任由大脑自动操作，且不知不觉在熟悉的常规中感到轻松舒适。“并非选择，而是习惯会控制那些没有思想的人。”19世纪时，威廉·华兹华斯说。在千变万化的21世纪，甚至“习惯”这个词本身也带有负面涵义。

So it *seems* antithetical(a.)(`=the opposite of it and is unable to exist with it`) *to talk about* habits *in the same context(`=the situation in which sth happens and that helps you to understand it`) as* creativity and innovation(`=the introduction of new things, ideas or ways of doing sth`). ② But brain researchers *have discovered* that {when we *consciously develop* new habits, we *create* parallel synaptic 突触的; 与突触有关的 paths, and even entirely(ad.)(`=in every way possible; completely`) new brain cells, that *can jump* our trains of thought *onto* new, innovative tracks}.

====
- antithetical : ADJ Something that is *antithetical to* something else is *the opposite of it and is unable to exist with it*. 对立的 +
-> Their priorities *are antithetical(a.) to* those of environmentalists. 他们的重点, 与环保主义者的重点, 是对立的。
====

因此，在创造和革新的背景下来谈论习惯，似乎显得有点矛盾。但大脑研究人员发现，当我们有意识地培养新的习惯，就创建了平行路径，甚至是全新的脑细胞，可以让我们思绪的列车, 跳转到新的创新轨道上来。

Rather than(`=instead of sb/sth`) *dismissing*(`=to decide that sb/sth is not important and not worth thinking or talking about`) ourselves *as* unchangeable creatures of habit, we *can instead(ad.)(`=in the place of sb/sth`) direct*(`=to aim sth in a particular direction or at a particular person`) our own change *by consciously developing* new habits. ② In fact, *the more* new things we try -- *the more* we *step outside* our comfort zone -- *the more* inherently(`=natural parts of it`) creative we become, *both* in the workplace *and* in our personal lives.

====
- *Rather than* dismissing ourselves as...  , we can *instead*(ad.) direct our own change ... +
-> *Rather than..., instead: 与其...不如...。* instead修饰的是整个句子,并不是direct。 +
instead在这里是个转折词，相当于but, however等词。 +
direct在这里是个及物动词，宾语为our own change, 翻译为“指导，指引“的意思

- *rather than* : instead of sb/sth 而不是 +
-> I think I'll have a cold drink *rather than coffee*. 我想要冷饮，不要咖啡。

- Rather than *dismissing ourselves as* unchangeable creatures of habit +
-> *dismiss… as… 不再考虑就认定某事是你想的那个样子。*

- *dismiss (v.) ~ sb/sth (as sth)* : to decide that sb/sth is not important and not worth thinking or talking about 不予考虑；摒弃；对…不屑一提 +
=> dis-, 分开，散开。miss,送出。即送走，引申词义摈弃。 +
-> I think *we can safely dismiss their objections*. 我认为我们对他们的异议完全可以不予理会。

- instead : adv. *in the place of sb/sth* 代替；顶替；反而；却 +
-> He didn't reply. *Instead*, he turned on his heel and left the room. 他没有回答，反而转身离开了房间。

- *direct : v.  +
direct sth to/towards sth/sb +
direct sth at/against sth/sb* : to aim sth in a particular direction or at a particular person 把…对准（某方向或某人） +
=> dis-, 分开。-reg, 竖直，引导，词源同regulate, correct. 引申义拉直，部署，管理。 +
-> Most of his anger *was directed(v.) against himself*. 他主要是生自己的气。 +
-> There are three main issues *that we need to direct(v.) our attention to*. 我们需要注意的主要有三个问题。

====

我们不用因为自己是受习惯影响的一成不变的生物, 而否定自己，相反, 我们可以通过有意识的培养新习惯, 来指导改变。事实上，我们对新事物尝试得越多，就会越远地走出自己的舒适地带，在职场及个人生活中变得越有创造性。

But *don’t bother* *trying to kill off* old habits; once those ruts(`=车轮在地上留下的印记`) of procedure(`=a way of doing sth, especially the usual or correct way`) *are worn into* the hippocampus (脑)海马体, they’re there *to stay*. ② Instead, the new habits (we *deliberately ingrain(`=to impress deeply on the mind or nature; instill`) into* ourselves) *create* parallel pathways that *can bypass*(`=to go around or avoid a place`) those old roads.

====
- rut : N-COUNT A rut is *a deep, narrow mark made in the ground by the wheels of a vehicle*. 车辙 +
=> route路，rut是最窄的路，车辙

- *in a rut* : N-COUNT If you say that someone is *in a rut*, you disapprove of the fact that *they have become fixed in their way of thinking and doing things, and find it difficult to change.* You can also say that someone's life or career is *in a rut*. (思维、做事方式的) 刻板状态; (生活、事业) 一成不变状态

- hippocampus => 来自希腊语hippokampos,古希腊神话中海王Neptune的战马，来自hippos,马，kampos,海妖。后用于解剖学术语指大脑部位海马体，因形如海马而得名，被认为是感情和记忆的中心。

- ingrain :V to impress deeply on the mind or nature; instil 把...深深地印在头脑中; 渗入 +
=> in-,进入，使，grain,纹理，颗粒。比喻用法。
====

但是，不要白费力气试图戒除旧习惯;一旦这些惯有程序融进脑部，它们就会留在那里。相反，我们有意使之根深蒂固的新习惯会创建平行路径，它们可以绕过原来那些路径。

“`主` The first thing *needed* for innovation `系` *is* a fascination(`=the state of being very attracted to and interested in sb/sth`) with wonder,” says Dawna Markova, author of “The Open Mind” and an executive change consultant 顾问 for Professional Thinking Partners. ② “But we *are taught instead(ad.) to ‘decide*,’ *just as* our president *calls* himself ‘the Decider 决定者，裁决者.’ ” She *adds*, however, that “*to decide* is *to kill off*(`=all of them or all of it have been killed or destroyed`) all possibilities but one. ③ A good innovational thinker *is always exploring* the many other possibilities.”
====
- *fascination : ~ (for/with sb/sth)* : the state of being very attracted to and interested in sb/sth 入迷；着迷
====


《开放思想》一书的作者达瓦纳·马克瓦说：“革新所需要的第一样东西, 就是对好奇的着迷。然而我们被教导去做决定，就像我们的总裁称呼自己为决策者那样。”她接着说，“但是，决定意味着,除了一种可能性外其他的都被扼杀了。优秀的具有革新精神的思想家, 总是在探寻着许多其他的可能性。”

All of us *work through*(`=to resolve (a problem, esp an emotional one), by thinking about it repeatedly and hence lessening its intensity either by gaining insight or by becoming bored by it`) problems *in ways of* which we’re unaware, she says. ② Researchers in the late 1960 *covered* that humans *are born* with the capacity *to approach(`=to start dealing with a problem, task, etc. in a particular way`) challenges* in four primary(`=main; most important; basic`) ways: analytically 分析地；解析地, procedurally 程序上地, relationally 有关系地，相关地 (or collaboratively 合作地；协作地) and innovatively 创造性地. ③ At puberty(`=the period of a person's life during which their sexual organs develop and they become capable of having children 青春期`), however, the brain *shuts down* half of that capacity, *preserving*(`=to keep a particular quality, feature, etc.; to make sure that sth is kept`) only those modes of thought that *have seemed* （涉及推断）好像，似乎，看来 most valuable(a.)(`=very useful or important`) during the first decade or so of life.

====
- work through : V *to resolve* (a problem, esp an emotional one), *by thinking about it repeatedly* and hence *lessening* its intensity *either by* gaining insight *or by* becoming bored by it 通过反复思考来解决问题; 尤指感情问题，通过反复思考获得认识或感觉无聊而降低问题强度

- puberty => 来自拉丁语pubes的所有格形式pubertis,长大的，成年的，有男子汉气概的，-y,名词后缀。引申词义青春期。
====

她说，我们都是通过一些自己没有意识到的方法解决问题的。研究人员在20世纪60年代末发现,人类天生主要用四种方法应对挑战：分析法，程序法，相关法(或合作法)和创新法。但是在青春期结束，大脑关闭一半的能力，仅仅保留了那些大约在生命最开始的十几年时间里似乎是最为宝贵的思维方式。

The current emphasis on standardized testing *highlights*(`=to emphasize sth, especially so that people give it more attention`) analysis and procedure, *meaning that* few of us *inherently use* our innovative and collaborative modes of thought. ② “This *breaks* the major rule in the American belief system -- that anyone *can do* anything,” *explains* M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book “This Year I Will...” and Ms. Markova’s business partner. ③ “*That’s a lie* that we *have perpetuated*(`=to make sth such as a bad situation, a belief, etc. continue for a long time`), and it *fosters*(`=to help it to develop`) commonness 平庸;共性；平凡. ④ `主` {*Knowing* what you’re good at /and *doing* even more of it} `谓` *creates* excellence(`=the quality of being extremely good`).” This is `表` *where* developing new habits *comes in*(`= to have a part in sth 在…中起作用；参与`).

====
- perpetuate : v.  *to make sth such as a bad situation, a belief, etc. continue for a long time* 使永久化；使持久化；使持续 +
=> per-,完全的，-pet,寻求，追寻，词源同compete,petition.引申词义持续，坚持。 +
-> This system *perpetuated itself for several centuries*. 这一制度维持了几个世纪。

- foster => 来自food,喂养，食物。

- *come in* ：If you ask *where something or someone comes in*, you are asking *what their role is in a particular matter*. (在某件事中)起作用，发挥作用 +
-> Rose asked again, 'But *where do we come in*, Henry?' 罗丝又问：“但是需要我们干什么，亨利？”

====

目前,标准化测试主要强调"分析法"和"程序法"这两种方式，也就是说，我们中很少有人会本能地使用"创新"和"合作"的思维方式。M.J.瑞恩是2006年出版的著作《今年我将...》一书的作者,以及马克瓦女士的商业合作伙伴，她解释说：“这打破了美国信念体系里的主要规则 —— 任何人都可以做任何事。这是一个我们已经使之永久化的谎言，这会造成平庸。了解你擅长什么，再多做一些就会成就卓越。”这正是培养新习惯的用武之地。

It is a wise father that *knows* his own child, but today a man *can boost*(`=to make sth increase, or become better or more successful`) his paternal(`=connected with being a father; typical of a kind father`) (fatherly) wisdom -- or at least *confirm* that he’s the kid’s dad.  ② All he needs to do *is* `表` *shell out*(`=to pay a lot of money for sth`) $30 for paternity(`=the fact of being the father of a child`) testing kit(`=a set of tools or equipment that you use for a particular purpose`) (PTK) at his local drugstore -- and another $120 *to get* the results.

俗话说，贤父知己子，但是如今男人可以提升自己的智慧，至少可以确认自己是孩子的父亲了。他所要做的就是在住所附近的药店里付30美元买一个父子关系测试包(PTK)，然后另支付120美元以获得结果。

More than 60,000 people *have purchased*(`=the act or process of buying sth`) the PTKs since they first *become available* without prescriptions(`=an official piece of paper on which a doctor writes the type of medicine you should have, and which enables you to get it from a chemist's shop/drugstore 处方；药方`) last years, according to Doug Fog, chief operating officer 首席营运官 of Identigene, which *makes* the over-the-counter  (证券等)不通过交易所而直接售给顾客的；不需处方可以出售的 kits. ② More than two dozen companies *sell* DNA tests *Directly to* the public , *ranging*(`=to vary between two particular amounts, sizes, etc., including others between them`) in price *from* a few hundred dollars *to* more than $2500.

道格·福格是Identigene(生产这种在药店可以出售的测试包的公司)的首席运营官，他指出，自从去年PTK无需处方就可以买到以来，购买者已经超过6万人。超过24家公司直接向公众出售DNA检测工具，价格从几百美元到2500多美元不等。

Among the most popular : paternity and kinship(`=the fact of being related in a family`) testing , which adopted 被收养的 children *can use* to find their biological relatives /and families *can use* *to track down* kids (*put up* 张贴；公布;提名…为候选人；参加竞选 for adoption(`= the act of adopting a child`)). ② DNA testing *is* also the latest rage(`=it continues with great force or violenc`) among passionate(`=having or showing strong feelings of enthusiasm for sth or belief in sth`) genealogists 宗谱学者 -- and *supports* businesses(n.) (that *offer* to search for a family's geographic roots).

====
- rage : n. is *strong anger* that is difficult to control. 盛怒 +
(2) V-I You say that something powerful or unpleasant *rages* when it continues with great force or violence. 肆虐 +
- *be all the rage* : ( informal ) *to be very popular and fashionable* 十分流行；成为时尚；风靡一时
====

最受欢迎的DNA测试是父子和血缘关系检测，被收养的孩子可以利用它找到自己的生物学亲属，家庭也可以用它来追踪到被收养的孩子。DNA检测最近不仅受到许多热心的族谱学家追捧，还为那些提供家族寻根服务的公司提供了支持。

Most tests *require* collecting cells by swabbing(`=to clean or remove liquid from a wound, etc., using a swab`) saliva 唾液 in the mouth and *sending it to* the company for testing. All tests *require* a potential candidate *with* whom *to compare* DNA.
====
- swab : v. to clean or remove liquid from a wound, etc., using a swab 用（医用的）拭子,药签,棉签来擦拭
====
许多测试需要从唾液中获取细胞，将唾液送至公司进行检测。所有的测试都需要另外一个相关人员的DNA进行比对。

But some observers *are* skeptical(`=having doubts that a claim or statement is true or that sth will happen`), “There is a kind of false precision *being hawked(`=to try to sell things by going from place to place asking people to buy them`) by* people (*claiming* they *are doing* ancestry(`=the family or the race of people that you come from （统称）祖宗`) testing),” says Trey Duster, a New York University sociologist. ② He *notes* that {each individual *has* many ancestors-numbering in the hundreds [just a few centuries back]}. ③ Yet most ancestry testing *only considers* a single lineage(`=the series of families that sb comes from originally 家系`), *either* the Y chromosome 染色体 *inherited through* men in a father’s line /*or* mitochondrial 线粒体的  DNA, which *is passed down* only from mothers. ④ This DNA *can reveal* genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people *also have* six other great-grandparents 曾祖父母；外曾祖父母 or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-grandparents.

====
- *chromosome* : N-COUNT A chromosome is a part of a cell in an animal or plant. It contains genes which determine what characteristics the animal or plant will have. 染色体 +
=> chromo, 颜色。-some, 身体，见somatic, 躯体的。
- *mitochondrion* : N. a small spherical or rodlike body, bounded by a double membrane, in the cytoplasm of most cells: contains enzymes responsible for energy production 线粒体 (Also called chondriosome) +
=> 借自希腊语的科学名词。来自希腊语mitos,线，丝，词源同mitre,khondrion,颗粒，软骨，词源同grind,hypochondria.用于指线粒体。
====

但是观察家们持怀疑态度。纽约州立大学的社会学家特洛伊·达斯特说，“那些声称可以进行血统检测的人，他们兜售的测试有一定的不准确性”。他注意到每个人都有许多祖先，仅几个世纪以前就有几百个之多。但是多数血统检测只考虑某个单一系统，或者是遗传自父亲的Y染色体，或者是只由母亲遗传的线粒体DNA。这个DNA只揭示了一两个祖先的基因信息。但是，仅仅3代之前，除了曾祖父母，他们还有6个外曾祖父母，或者4代以前，除了曾曾祖父母，他们还有14个外曾曾祖父母。

Critics also *argue* that {commercial genetic testing *is* only *as good as* 和…几乎一样，实际上等于 the reference(`=ones that you look at when you need specific information or facts about a subject`) collections (*to* which a sample *is compared*)}. ② `主` Databases *used by* some companies `谓` *don’t rely on* data *collected systematically* /but rather *lump(`=to collect into a mass or group`) together* information *from* different research projects. ③ This *means* that a DNA database *may differ*(v.)(`=to be different from sb/sth`) *depending on* the company that *processes*(`=to treat raw material, food, etc. in order to change it, preserve it, etc`) the results. ④ In addition, `主` the computer programs (a company *uses* to estimate relationships) `谓` *may be* patented(a.)(`=obtain a patent for it`) and *not subject to*(`=to make sb/sth experience, suffer or be affected by sth, usually sth unpleasant`) peer review or outside evaluation.

====
- reference : n./v./a. the act of looking at sth for information 参考；查询；查阅 +
-> *a useful reference(a.) work* for teachers. 一本对老师们有用处的参考资料。

- *subject sb/sth to sth* : to make sb/sth experience, suffer or be affected by sth, usually sth unpleasant 使经受；使遭受 +
-> *to be subjected to* ridicule 受到嘲笑
====

批评家们还争论说，商业性基因检测的好坏取决于参照基因数据库的好坏，参照基因数据库是用来同样本进行对比的。一些公司使用的数据库里的数据并非系统性的采集而得，而是将不同研究项目的信息胡乱搜集在一起。这意味某个DNA数据库可能会从某些地区收集很多信息，而在别的地区不收集信息，所以一个人的测试结果会随着测试公司的不同而不同。此外，公司用来评估血缘关系的电脑程序可能申请了专利，不能对其进行同行审查或外界评估。

贫穷国家中正规教育与经济发展之间的关系, 为经济学家及政治家们普遍误解。毫无疑问，在这两个方面都有所进步, 对于这些国家及其他国家的社会、政治及学术发展而言是必要的，但是那种认为“教育应该是促进贫穷国家经济快速发展的重要因素之一”的传统观点, 是错误的。我们庆幸这个传统观点的确是错误的，因为创立新的教育体制，让足够多的人接受教育以推动经济发展, 需要两代或三代人来完成。一家研究机构的研究成果一再表明, 所有国家的工人都可以进行（非正规）培训上岗以大幅度提高生产率，从而提高生活水平。  +
注：trained on the job其实翻译成培训上岗，或岗前培训即可，但为了体现出与formal education的强烈对比，这里我加上了（非正式）三个字强调前后不一。


Ironically(`=a situation that is odd or amusing because it involves a contrast`), the first evidence for this idea *appeared* in the United States. ② Not long ago, with the country *entering* a recessing(`=a period of time during the year when the members of a parliament, committee, etc. do not meet`) /and Japan at its pre-bubble 泡沫前 peak. ③ The U.S. workforce(`=all the people in a country or an area who are available for work`) *was derided(`=to treat sb/sth as ridiculous and not worth considering seriously`) as* poorly educated /and one of primary cause of the poor U.S. economic performance. ④ Japan *was*, and *remains*, the global leader in automotive-assembly 汽车装配 productivity. ⑤ Yet the research *revealed* that {the U.S. factories of Honda Nissan, and Toyota *achieved* about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts} -- a result of the training (that U.S. workers *received* on the job).
====
- *deride : v. ~ sb/sth (as sth)*: ( formal ) to treat sb/sth as ridiculous and not worth considering seriously 嘲笑；愚弄；揶揄 +
=> 单词ridiculous（荒谬的）的字面意思就是“可笑的”，词根-rid-指“笑”，来自拉丁语ridere（笑）；可用该词来反向助记这个词根。前缀de-指“向下”，词根-rid-指“笑”，-e为后缀；字面义“向下笑”。derision（嘲笑；笑柄），risible（可笑的；引人发笑的）。

具有讽刺意味的是，这一观点的首个证据出现在美国。不久前，随着美国经济陷入衰退，日本正处于泡沫破灭前的高峰期，美国工人被嘲讽没有受过良好教育，并且被认为这是美国经济不景气的主要原因之一。在全球，不管过去还是现在，日本一直是汽车组装生产力的领袖。然而，研究表明丰田、尼桑和本田位于美国工厂的生产率大约是日本同行的95%，这是美国工人接受在职培训的结果。

More recently, while *examining* housing construction 房屋建筑工程, the researchers *discovered* that {`主` illiterate(a.)(`=not knowing how to read or write`), non-English-speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, `谓` *consistently met* best-practice （公司运营或提供服务的）最佳做法，最优方法 labor productivity standards *despite* the complexity of the building industry’s work}.

最近，在进行住房建设检查时，研究人员发现在德克萨斯州的休斯顿，尽管建筑行业的工作复杂，但是未受过教育的，英语不是母语的墨西哥工人总是能够达到最佳的劳动生产率的各项标准。 

What *is* the real relationship between education and economic development? We *have to suspect*(`=to be suspicious about sth; to not trust sth`) that {continuing economic growth *promotes* the development of education *even* when governments *don’t force* it}. ② After all, that’s how education *got started*. When our ancestors *were* hunters and gatherers(n.) 10,000 years ago, they *didn’t have time to wonder much about anything* besides *finding food*. ③ [Only when humanity *began to get its food* in a more productive way] *was* there time for other things.

- *副词only置于句首， 强调方式状语、 条件状语、 地点状语、 时间状语等状语时， 主句要进行部分倒装。 如果放于句首的only所修饰的不是状语时， 该句不用倒装。* 例如，[Only when we had studied the data again] did we realize that there was a mistake. 只有当我们再次研究了这些数据的时候， 我们才意识到出了一个错。 +

教育与经济发展之间的关系到底如何?我们不得不怀疑，即使政府不强迫发展教育，经济持续增长也会促进教育事业的发展。毕竟，教育就是那样开始的。一万年前当我们的祖先还在狩猎和采集野果时，除了寻找食物他们没有时间想其它很多的东西。只有当人类开始以一种更有效率的方式获取食物时，他们才有时间去思考其他的事情。

*As* education *improved*, humanity’s productivity potential *increased as well*. ② When the competitive environment *pushed* our ancestors *to achieve* that potential, they *could [in turn] afford* more education. ③ This increasingly high level of education *is* probably a necessary, but *not* a sufficient, condition for the complex political systems *required by* advanced economic performance. ④ Thus poor countries *might not be able to escape* their poverty traps(n.)(`=an unpleasant situation from which it is hard to escape`) without political changes (that *may be* possible *only with* broader formal education). ⑤ A lack of formal education, however, *doesn’t constrain*(`=to restrict or limit sb/sth`) the ability of the developing world’s 发展中国家 workforce *to substantially(`=very much; a lot`) improve productivity* for the forested future. ⑥ On the contrary 正相反, constraints on improving productivity *explain* {why education *isn’t developing more quickly there* than it is}.

- A lack of formal education, however, doesn't constrain *the ability* (of the developing world's workforce) (*to substantially improve* productivity) for the forested future. +
-> 这里的  to substantially improve productivity 也是作为 the ability 的定语的.

随着教育的进步，人类的生产潜力也增加了。当竞争的环境推动我们的祖先实现这一潜力，他们又可以获得更多的教育机会。先进的经济水平要求复杂的政治制度，越来越高的教育水平可能是这种复杂政治制度的必要的，但不是充分的条件。因此，如果没有政治改革，贫穷国家可能无法摆脱其贫困陷阱，而想要这种政治改革成功, 则必须依靠更广泛的正规教育才能实现。但是，发展中国家的劳动力，在可预见的未来持续提高生产力的能力，没有因缺乏正规教育而受到限制。相反，生产力的提高受到限制，正是那里的教育发展得不够快的原因。

(本文作者的核心观点是什么? -- 并非表面的教育, 而是内核的"政治体系改革"才可以使贫穷国家摆脱贫困陷阱.)

`主` The relationship *between* formal education *and* economic growth in poor countries `谓` *is widely misunderstood by* economists and politicians alike. Progress in both area *is* undoubtedly necessary for the social, political and intellectual development of these and all other societies; however, `主` the conventional view (that education *should be* one of the very highest priorities *for* promoting(v.) rapid economic development in poor countries) `系` *is* wrong. *We are fortunate(a.) that* it is, because `主` *building* new educational systems there /and *putting* enough people *through* them *to improve* economic performance `谓` *would require* two or three generations. The findings of a research institution *have consistently shown* that {workers in all countries *can be trained* on the job *to achieve* radical higher productivity and, as a result, radically higher standards of living}.

Ironically, the first evidence for this idea *appeared* in the United States. Not long ago, with the country *entering* a recessing /and Japan *at* its pre-bubble peak. The U.S. workforce *was derided as* poorly educated /and one of primary cause of the poor U.S. economic performance. Japan *was*, and *remains*, the global leader in automotive-assembly productivity. Yet the research *revealed* that {the U.S. factories of Honda Nissan, and Toyota *achieved* about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts -- a result of the training that U.S. workers *received* on the job}.

More recently, while *examining* housing construction, the researchers *discovered* that {illiterate, non-English-speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, *consistently met* best-practice labor productivity standards *despite* the complexity of the building industry’s work}.

What *is* the real relationship *between* education *and* economic development? We *have to suspect that* {continuing economic growth *promotes* the development of education *even* when governments *don’t force* it}. After all, that’s how education *got started*. When our ancestors *were* hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they *didn’t have time to wonder much about anything* besides *finding food*. [Only when humanity *began to get its food* in a more productive way] *was* there time for other things.

*As* education *improved*, humanity’s productivity potential *increased [as well]*. When the competitive environment *pushed* our ancestors *to achieve* that potential, they *could [in turn] afford* more education. This increasingly high level of education *is* probably a necessary, *but not* a sufficient, condition *for* the complex political systems *required by* advanced economic performance. Thus poor countries *might not be able to escape* their poverty traps *without* political changes *that may be possible* only with broader formal education. A lack of formal education, however, *doesn’t constrain* the ability of the developing world’s workforce *to substantially improve productivity* for the forested future. On the contrary, constraints on improving productivity *explain* why education *isn’t developing more quickly* there than it is.

`主` The most *thoroughly(`=very much; completely`) studied* in the history of the new world `系` *are* the ministers(`=a trained religious leader`) and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. ② According to _the standard history of American philosophy_, nowhere else in colonial America *was* “So much important *attached to* intellectual pursuits(n.)(`=the act of looking for or trying to find sth`) ” According to many books and articles, New England’s leaders *established* the basic themes and preoccupations(`=a state of thinking about sth continuously; sth that you think about frequently or for a long time`) of an unfolding(`=to be gradually made known; to gradually make sth known to other people`), dominant Puritan 清教徒;禁欲者；苦行者 tradition in American intellectual life.

在新大陆的历史上，被研究的最彻底的学者，是17世纪新英格兰的牧师和政治领袖们。根据美国标准哲学史的记载，在美洲殖民地中,“其他地区的人对学术的追求都没有这么狂热。”据许多书籍及文章记载，新英格兰的领袖们在美国学术界中确立了正在发展、后来成为主流的清教传统的基本主题和关注点。(根据许多书籍和文章，新英格兰的领导人确立了美国知识分子生活中正在展开的、占主导地位的清教徒传统的基本主题和关注点。)

`主` *To take* this approach(`=a path, road, etc. that leads to a place`) *to* the New Englanders `谓` *normally mean* to start with the Puritans’ theological 神学上的 innovations /and their distinctive(a.)(`=having a quality or characteristic that makes sth different and easily noticed`) ideas about the church -- important subjects that we *may not neglect*. ② But *in keeping with* 符合；与…一致 our examination of southern intellectual life, we *may consider* the original Puritans *as* carriers(`=a person or thing that carries sth`) of European culture *adjusting to* New world circumstances. ③ The New England colonies *were* the scenes of important episodes(`=an event, a situation, or a period of time in sb's life, a novel, etc. that is important or interesting in some way`) in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility(`=polite behaviour`) and virtuosity(`= a very high degree of skill in performing or playing`).
====
-  virtuosity => 来自 virtue,男人的品行，坚毅，果敢，勇气等，词义抽象化为高超技艺。

通过这条途径来了解新英格兰人，通常意味着要首先研究清教徒的神学创新，和对于教会的不同理念——这是我们不可忽略的重要课题（在新英格兰人身上做此一尝试，通常意味着以清教教义革新和清教特有的观念为起点，而清教特有的关于教会重要性的课题是我们不可忽略的）。但是为了与我们对南部学术界的研究保持一致，我们可以将最初的清教徒们视作欧洲文化的传递者，他们根据新大陆的情况进行了调整。新英格兰作为殖民地，在追求广为人知的礼貌及艺术鉴赏力的过程中，发生了许多重要事件。

The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay *included* men of impressive(`=making you feel admiration, because they are very large, good, skilful, etc`) education and influence in England. ② Besides the ninety *or so* 大约 learned(a.)(`=having a lot of knowledge because you have studied and read a lot`) ministers who *came to* Massachusetts church [in the decade after 1629], There *were* political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated(a.)(`=having had a high standard of education; showing a high standard of education`) gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown(`=the government of a country, thought of as being represented by a king or queen`) 皇室官员 before he *journeyed(`=to travel, especially a long distance`) to* Boston. ③ There men *wrote and published extensively(`=covering a large area; great in amount`)*, *reaching* both New World and Old World audiences, and *giving* New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness(`=very serious and sincere`).

到达马萨诸塞州的最早定居者，包括那些在英格兰接受过良好的教育并深具影响力的英国人。在1629年之后的十年间，除了90多位来到马萨诸塞教堂的有学识的牧师，还有像约翰·温斯罗普这样的政治领袖，在到达波士顿之前，他是一位受过良好教育的绅士、律师及皇室官员。这些人大量写作、出版书籍，新旧大陆都有读者，这样便给新大陆带来了热衷学术的氛围。

We *should not forget* , however, that most New Englanders *were less well educated*. ② While few crafts(`=an activity involving a special skill at making things with your hands`) men or farmers, *let alone* 更不用说, 还不算 dependents 依赖他人者；受赡养者 and servants, *left* literary compositions(`=a piece of music or art, or a poem 作品`) *to be analyzed*, it is obvious that their views *were less fully intellectualized*(`=consider it in an intellectual way`). ② Their thinking often *had* a traditional superstitions 迷信；迷信观念（或思想） quality. ③ A tailor (男装)裁缝  named John Dane, who *emigrated* in the late 1630s, *left an account(`=an explanation or a description of an idea, a theory or a process 解释，说明`) of* his reasons *for leaving England* that *is filled with signs*(`=an event, an action, a fact, etc. that shows that sth exists, is happening or may happen in the future`). sexual confusion, economic frustrations(`=the fact that sth is preventing sth/sb from succeeding`) , and religious hope -- all *came together* in a decisive(`=very important for the final result of a particular situation`) moment when he *opened* the Bible, *told his father* {the first line (he saw) *would settle his fate*}, and *read* the magical words: “*come out from* among them, *touch* no unclean thing , and I *will be* your God /and you *shall be* my people.” One *wonders* {what Dane *thought of* the careful sermons(n.)(`=a talk on a religious or moral subject that is given by a member of the clergy as part of a church service`) *explaining* the Bible that he heard in puritan churches}.

====
-  frustrate => 来自fraud, 欺骗，伤害。即被欺骗的，被伤害的，受到挫折的。
- sermon => 来自拉丁语 sermonem,说话，谈话，讨论，演说，字面意思即把字词组合在一起，来自 PIE*ser, 连接，排列，词源同 serial,series,sort.-mon,名词后缀。现词义缩写自 sermo religiosus,说道， 布教，字面意思即 religious sermon,宗教演说，宗教讲演。
====

但是，我们不应该忘记，大多数新英格兰人没有受过良好教育。极少有工匠或农民(更不用说靠他们养活的家人及仆人)留下文学作品以供分析，但是很明显，他们的观点并不具有很大的学术性。他们的思想中往往有一种传统的迷信成份。 +
一个名为约翰·戴恩的裁缝于17世纪30年代末移民到新大陆，他留下一个记录，陈述了离开英格兰的理由，内容充满了预兆。在一个决定性的时刻，他打开圣经，告诉父亲说，自己看到的第一行字会决定他的命运，他读了那些神奇的话语：“(圣经原文)从他们中间出来，不要沾不洁净之物，我将成为你们的神，你们将成为我的子民”。性的混乱，经济挫折和宗教希望 -- 这所有的一切在他打开圣经的一刹那都出现了。人们想知道, 戴恩在清教教堂里听到布道牧师认真解释圣经时, 会作何感想。


Mean while , many settles *had* slighter(`=very small in degree`) religious commitments(`=a strong belief in an idea or system`) *than* Dane’s, *as* one clergyman(`=a male priest or minister in the Christian Church`) *learned* in confronting(`=to face sb so that they cannot avoid seeing and hearing you, especially in an unfriendly or dangerous situation`) folk(`=people in general`) [along the coast] who *mocked*(`=to laugh at sb/sth in an unkind way, especially by copying what they say or do`) that {they *had not come to* the New world *for* religion . “Our main end(`=an aim or a purpose`) *was* to catch fish}. ”

与此同时，许多定居者并没有戴恩那样虔诚，就像一位牧师在海边遇到一些人时听到的那样，那些人嘲弄说他们不是为了宗教来到新大陆的。“我们的主要目的是为了捕鱼。”
