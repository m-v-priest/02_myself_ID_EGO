- 百万英里电池, 对电动汽车意味着什么? +
这主要意味着可靠性的提高


*AS* EVERY MOBILE-PHONE owner *knows*, [after a year or so] the battery *starts to fade* and the beast *needs* recharging(v.)给（电池）充电；充电 more frequently. That is a nuisance 麻烦事；讨厌的人（或东西）, but a phone’s batteries *can be replaced fairly cheaply* -- or the whole handset  电话听筒;（电视等的）遥控器 *traded in* 以旧物折价换新物；折价贴换 for the latest model. An electric car, however, *is* a much bigger investment. And batteries *are* its priciest component, *representing* 等于；相当于；意味着 around 30% of an average mid-size vehicle. *Apart from* increasing(v.) the risk of *running out of juice* 汽油;电 and *leaving a driver stranded*  使滞留;使搁浅, a deteriorating 恶化 battery *quickly destroys* a car’s second-hand value.

- nuisance : /ˈnuːsns/ n. [ Cusually sing. ] a thing, person or situation that is annoying or causes trouble or problems 麻烦事；讨厌的人（或东西） / [ CU ] ( law 律 ) behaviour by sb that annoys other people and that a court can order the person to stop 妨害行为 +
=> 来自拉丁语nocere,去伤害，谋害，词源同necro-,noxious,innocent.后词义弱化，用来指妨害行为，讨厌的人。
.. *What a nuisance*! 真麻烦！


- handset : the part of a telephone that you hold close to your mouth and ear to speak into and listen 电话听筒 / （电视等的）遥控器 +

.. This decision *represents a significant departure from previous policy*. 这个决定意味着在很大程度上脱离了原先的政策。

- 每个手机用户都知道，过了一年左右，手机电池就会开始老化，而这只野兽需要更频繁地来充电。这是很讨人厌的事情，但是手机的电池还算能相当便宜地被更换 ——或者整个手机都可以以旧换新来换成最新的型号。然而，电动车却是一项更大的投资。电池是其最昂贵的部件，平均约占中型汽车成本的30%(2019年国内网站称, 动力电池成本虽持续降低 但仍接近整车的40%)。电池的老化除了会增加电池耗尽的风险，让司机滞留于马路上外，还会迅速伤害汽车的二手价值。


*To provide* buyers *with* some `peace 平静；安静；宁静 of mind` 内心的宁静；明镜止水, carmakers *guarantee* their batteries, typically *for* eight years or around 200,000km. Producers *are* now, though, *planning to go much further than that*, with the launch of `“million mile” (1.6m kilometre) batteries`. Zeng Yuqun, the boss of `Contemporary 属同时期的；同一时代的;当代的；现代的 Amperex Technology`, a giant Chinese firm which *produces batteries for* a number of carmakers, *said* in June *that* his company *was ready to start manufacturing(v.)（用机器）大量生产，成批制造 batteries* which *would last for* 16 years or 2m kilometres. Elon Musk *has hinted that* Tesla, a Californian maker of `electric vehicles` of which he is boss, *has* a million-mile battery *in the works*. Rumours *suggest* this *could be unveiled* in September. And over 再；又;在…的远端（或对面） in Detroit 底特律, General Motors (GM) *is in the final stages of* developing(v.) an advanced battery which *it says* has similar longevity.

- "能往返月球两次" +
阿贡国家实验室, 位于芝加哥附近, 其能源储存联合研究中心主任, 乔治·克莱布特里说, "这是一个很好的广告语"。但是，你能用它来驾驶100万英里这一事实, 可能并不是最值得关注的参数。“过度使用一辆汽车，它的电池会更快地损坏。经常快速充电, 也会缩短电池寿命，过度充电和深度放电, 也是如此。在极热或极冷的天气里开车, 无益于电池寿命。即使你把车停在车库里不用，电池寿命也会自然缩短。百万英里电池的真正意义在于，技术进步能使电池的百万英里成为可能, 它也能处理电池老化这些问题。

`主` The lithium 锂-ion 离子 (Li-ion) batteries` which *power* electric cars `谓` *age(v.) in two ways*: with time and with use. Battery-makers *call* time-dependent ageing “calendar ageing”. It is a consequence of `the gradual degradation` 毁坏，恶化（过程） of some of the materials *employed* 应用；运用；使用 in battery construction. This degradation *reduces a battery’s ability* to hold a charge （电池或带电物质的）充电量，电荷 -- though even here *it is possible to ameliorate(v.)改善；改进；改良 the problem to a certain extent*. `主` Leaving a car with a fully *rather than* partly charged battery, for example, `谓` *can increase* the rate of calendar ageing.

.. The police had to *employ force to enter the building*. 警察不得不强行进入大楼。

- ameliorate :  /əˈmiːliəreɪt/ [ VN ] ( formal ) to make sth better 改善；改进；改良 +
=> 前缀a- 同ad-. 词根mel, 加强，多，见multitude, 许多。-ior, 比较级后缀。

- 为电动汽车提供动力的锂离子电池, 会随着时间和使用数量而老化。电池制造商将"依赖于时间的老化", 称为“日程老化”。这是因为电池制造中使用的一些材料, 性能会逐渐退化的结果。这种退化, 会降低电池的充电能力——尽管在某种程度上, 可以改善这个问题。例如，将汽车电池完全充满，比只充一部分, 会增加"日程老化"的速度。


Use-dependent ageing *is a consequence* of the number of `discharge-recharge cycles` (a battery *goes through* 经历，经受（尤指苦难或艰难时期）). *It is caused by* `the complex chemical reactions` that *take place* when a battery *is operating*. Some of these *are essential to* a battery’s job of *storing and releasing energy*. “But there *are* also `side reactions` [化学] 副反应；副作用 that you *can’t stop* /and some of those *are harmful*,” explains Dr Crabtree.


*As* a battery *discharges*, lithium ions (lithium atoms (with an electron missing)) *are created* [at one electrode 电极, the anode 阳极]. These then *shuttle(v.)穿梭; 频繁往来（于甲地和乙地之间）; （在较近的两地之间定时）往返运送 through* a liquid electrolyte 电解液；电解质 *to* a second electrode, the cathode 阴极；负极. The electrons *stripped away* at the anode 阳极, meanwhile, *travel towards* the cathode 阴极 *along* an external 外部的；外面的 electrical circuit 电路, which *powers(v.) the car*. Ions and electrons 电子 *are reunited （使）重逢，再次相聚; （使）再结合，再联合 at the cathode* and *remain there* until the battery *is plugged 能与（电源或其他电器）连接 into a charger* 充电器 and *the process is reversed*.

- electrode : /ɪˈlektroʊd/ either of two points (or terminals ) by which an electric current enters or leaves a battery or other electrical device 电极 +
=> electro, 电。-od, 路，见method, anode. +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/e/electrode.jpg[100,100]

- anode : n.   /ˈænəʊd/
( technical 术语 ) the electrode in an electrical device where oxidation occurs; the positive electrode in an electrolytic cell and the negative electrode in a battery 阳极 +
=> 前缀ana-, 向上。词根hod, 路，见odometer, 里程计，同词根ced, 走。

- cathode : /ˈkæθoʊd/ ( technical 术语 ) the electrode in an electrical device where reduction occurs; the negative electrode in an electrolytic cell and the positive electrode in a battery 阴极；负极 +
=> cata-, 向下。-hod, 走，路，词源同accede, anode, method.

- reunite : v.  *~ A with B | ~ A and B* [ usually passive ] to bring two or more people together again after they have been separated for a long time; to come together again （使）重逢，再次相聚 / to join together again separate areas or separate groups within an organization, a political party, etc.; to come together again （使）再结合，再联合 +
.. *The family was reunited* after the war. 战争过后，一家人又相聚了。
.. As leader, his main aim *is to reunite the party*. 作为领导，他的主要目标就是要使党内各派团结起来。


- 当电池放电时，锂离子(缺少一个电子的锂原子)在阳极上产生。然后它们通过液体电解质, 进入第二个电极——阴极。与此同时，阳极上的电子被剥离，沿着为汽车提供动力的外部电路, 流向阴极。离子和电子聚集在阴极上，并一直停留在那里，直到电池被插入充电器，然后过程再反过来。

- 当对电池进行充电时，电池的正极上有锂离子生成，生成的锂离子经过电解液运动到负极。而作为负极的碳呈层状结构，它有很多微孔，达到负极的锂离子就嵌入到碳层的微孔中，嵌入的锂离子越多，充电容量越高。同样，当对电池进行放电时（即我们使用电池的过程），嵌在负极碳层中的锂离子脱出，又运动回正极。回正极的锂离子越多，放电容量越高。


Each cycle of discharge and recharge *takes its toll*(（道路、桥梁的）通行费) 产生恶果；造成重大损失（或伤亡、灾难等）. Lithium *is [so] highly reactive*(a.)反应的；有反应的；回应的;能起化学反应的；易反应的 [that] `主` stopping(v.) it *getting tied up* 把…缠住；使不能分身;把…联系起来；使与…有关系 in other chemical compounds [while a battery *is in use*] `系` *is hard*. Even `主` a small amount of diversion 转向；转移；偏离 per cycle `谓` *adds up*, *reducing* the amount of the element available to store energy. On top of this, `主` charging up 给…充电 faster *than* ions can be absorbed by the anode `谓` *may result in* a layer of lithium “plating”(n.)镀层（镀在金属上的其他金属薄层）;外层；（尤指）金属板护层 *building up* 加大；加强；增多 on the anode’s surface, *reducing* its storage capacity.

- toll （道路、桥梁的）通行费 /  （战争、灾难等造成的）毁坏；伤亡人数

- *take a heavy toll (on sb/sth)* : take its toll (on sb/sth)
to have a bad effect on sb/sth; to cause a lot of damage, deaths, suffering, etc. 产生恶果；造成重大损失（或伤亡、灾难等）
.. Illness had taken a heavy toll on her. 疾病对她的身体造成极大的损害。

- plating : a thin covering of a metal, especially silver or gold, on another metal 镀层（镀在金属上的其他金属薄层） / a layer of coverings, especially of metal plates 外层；（尤指）金属板护层

- 每一次的充放电循环, 都会有损失。锂的反应性非常强，以至于在电池使用过程中, 很难阻止它与其他化合物相结合。即使每个充放电循环中的少量锂的转移, 累加起来，也会降低"可供存储电量的物质"的数量。最重要的是，充电速度如果超过阳极能吸收离子的速度, 可能会导致在阳极表面形成一层锂“镀层”，从而降低其电量存储容量。


Plating *becomes yet more of a problem* [if it *leads to* the development of structures *called* dendrites （神经的） 树突]. These *are* `small, finger-like fibres` which *project 突出；外伸；伸出 into* the electrolyte 电解液，电解质 *from* points on the anode where plating *is especially elevated* 提高；使升高;举起；抬起;使情绪高昂；使精神振奋；使兴高采烈.  [If a dendrite *reaches* the cathode] the battery *will short-circuit* （使）短路, *causing it to heat up rapidly* and *possibly catch fire*. Other `side reactions` *can have similarly adverse 不利的；有害的；反面的 consequences*.

-  dendrite : /ˈdendraɪt/ n. ( also den·dron   /ˈdendrɒn/   ) ( biology 生 ) a short branch at the end of a nerve cell, which receives signals from other cells 树突（位于神经元末端的细分支，接收其他神经元传来的信号）
—— compare axon +
=>  词源同tree. 前面den-为dr的韵律重复。用于神经学名词树突。拼写比较gangrene. +
-> *dendritic cells* 树突细胞 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/d/dendrite.jpg[100,100]

- 如果镀层导致了一种称为"树突结构"的形成，就会成为一个更大的问题。这些手指状的小纤维, 会从阳极点(在这儿电镀层特别活跃)伸向电解液中, 如果这些树突达到阴极，就会使电池短路，使其迅速升温，并可能着火。其他的副作用, 也会产生类似的不良后果。

It is difficult *to generalise about* the extent (*to which* these processes *reduce a battery’s lifetime*). Not only *does it depend on* how that battery is used, but also *how it is made*. Li-ion cells 电池 *come in different forms* and a variety of chemistries 化学成分; 化学反应, some of which *have not been around 出现；现有；可用 long enough* in cars *for people to know for sure* how long they will last(v.). Nor *is there* any independent testing(n.), says Dr Crabtree.

- around : present in a place; available 出现；现有；可用
.. *There was more money around* in those days. 那年头比现在富裕。
.. I knocked *but there was no one around*. 我敲了门，但是没有人应门。
.. Digital television *has been around* for some time now. 数字电视已经面市一段时间了。

- 这些过程会将电池寿命减少到何种程度, 很难对此进行概括. 这不仅取决于电池是如何被使用的，而且还取决于它是如何制造的。锂离子电池有不同的形式和不同的化学成分，有些锂离子电池, 在汽车上出现的时间还不够长，人们还不知道它们在汽车上能用多久。克莱布特里博士说，目前也没有任何独立的检测方法。


Nevertheless, the industry *has a few `rules of thumb`* 拇指规则, 经验法则. Once a battery’s capacity *falls below 80% of its starting value*, it *is generally thought* no longer suitable(a.) for *use(v.) in vehicles*. Some *reckon that*, on average, Li-ion batteries *lose 2% of their capacity* a year. This *may not seem much*, but [by the time *a vehicle is six years old*] it *could mean* it is halfway through its useful life.

- RULE OF THUMB : “大拇指规则 ”，又叫”经验法则“，是一种可用于许多情况的简单的，经验性的，探索性的但不是很准确的原则。 +
Rule of thumb在经济学中的解释是：“拇指规则”是指经济决策者对信息的处理方式不是按照理性预期的方式，把所有获得的信息都引入到决策模型中，他们往往遵循的是：只考虑重要信息，而忽略掉其他信息。否则信息成本无限高。

- 尽管如此，这个行业还是有一些经验法则。一旦电池的容量低于其初始值的80%，一般认为它不再适合在汽车上使用。一些人估计，锂离子电池, 平均每年损耗2%的容量。这可能看起来不多，但当一辆车用了6年的时候，这可能意味着它(电池)的使用寿命已经过半了。


*The long road* ahead

Battery technology *is improving all the time*. *As a consequence*, *so are* `calendar` and `use-dependent lifetimes`. `主` *Getting direct experience* of how electric cars are used(v.) `谓` *is helping* researchers *come up with ways* to mitigate(v.)减轻；缓和 some of the `side reactions`, *says* Tim Grewe, the head of GM’s `electrification 电气化 strategy`. The company *employs*  应用；运用；使用 `remote, “telematic” 信息通讯业务；远程信息处理 monitoring` 监控 *to keep track of* how batteries *are performing in its cars*, and also *takes back* some batteries *from* ① `high-mileage 英里里程 drivers` and ② `those *living in extreme environments*`, *such as* deserts and mountainous regions, for analysis.

- electrification : [ U ] the process of changing sth so that it works by electricity 电气化 +
电气化是指在工农业生产和城乡人民生活中普遍地使用电力，工农业生产中的高度机械化是与电气化分不开的。

- telematic : /,telɪ'mætɪk/ n. 信息通讯业务；远程信息处理 +
Telematics是远距离通信的**电信（Telecommunications）与信息科学（Informatics）**的合成词，按字面可定义为通过内置在汽车、航空、船舶、火车等运输工具上的计算机系统、无线通信技术、卫星导航装置, 交换文字、语音等信息的互联网技术, 而提供信息的服务系统。简单的说就通过无线网络, 将车辆接入互联网，为车主提供驾驶、生活所必需的各种信息。 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/t/telematic.jpg[100,100]

- 前方漫长的路 +
电池技术一直在进步。因此，与"日程老化"和"使用导致的老化"问题也是如此。通用汽车的电气化战略负责人蒂姆·格雷韦(Tim Grewe)表示，直接体验电动汽车是如何被使用的, 有助于研究人员找到方法, 来减轻某些副作用. 该公司采用远程“遥测”技术, 来跟踪电池在其汽车中的表现，并从行驶里程长的驾驶者, 和生活在沙漠和山区等极端环境中的人那里, 回收一些汽车电池, 来进行分析。


`主` *Dealing with impurities* 杂质 which *get into batteries* `谓` *helps to extend their lives*. Water, for example, *reacts(v.) with salts* in the electrolyte 电解质 *to form an acid*, which *attacks the electrodes* 电极. *To prevent this*, GM *has developed an additive* 添加剂 made(v.) from a type of material *called* a zeolite 沸石. Zeolites *are* molecular 分子的 sponges 海绵. GM’s version *serves*(v.) *to mop up 吸干净；吸去…的水分 any moisture* 潮气；水汽；水分 which *enters* a battery cell.

- impurity  /ɪmˈpjʊrəti/

- zeolite : /'ziə,laɪt/ N any of a large group of glassy secondary minerals consisting of hydrated aluminium silicates of calcium, sodium, or potassium: formed in cavities in lava flows and plutonic rocks 沸石 +
是一种矿石. 有一类天然硅铝酸盐矿石, 在灼烧时会产生沸腾现象，因此命名为“沸石”（瑞典文zeolit）。在希腊文中意为“沸腾”（zeo）的“石头”（lithos）。沸石是沸石族矿物的总称，是一种含水的碱或碱土金属铝硅酸盐矿物。 +
沸石的共同特点就是具有架状结构，就是说 *在它们的晶体内，分子像搭架子似地连在一起，中间形成很多空腔。因为在这些空腔里还存在很多水分子，因此它们是含水矿物。这些水分在遇到高温时会排出来*，比如用火焰去烧时，大多数沸石便会膨胀发泡，像是沸腾一般。*沸石中的水分可以跑出来，但这并不会破坏沸石内部的晶体结构。因此，它还可以再重新吸收水或其他液体。* +
不同的沸石具有不同的形态. +
世界上已发现的天然沸石一般为浅灰色，有时为肉红色。拿在手上明显感到比一般石头轻，这是因为沸石内部充满了细微的孔穴和通道，比蜂房要复杂得多。假如把沸石比作旅馆，那么1立方微米的这种“超级旅馆”内竟有100万个“房间”！ +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/z/zeolite.jpg[100,100]

- *mop sth/sb up* : to remove the liquid from sth using sth that absorbs it 吸干净；吸去…的水分 / mop : v. to clean sth with a mop 用拖把擦干净 /** ~ sth (from sth)** to remove liquid from the surface of sth using a cloth 用布擦掉（表面）的液体

- 处理进入电池的杂质, 有助于延长电池的寿命。例如，水和电解质中的盐发生反应，形成酸，酸会损害电极。为了防止这种情况发生，通用公司开发了一种由沸石材料制成的添加剂。沸石的分子会组成像海绵一样的解构。通用汽车公司的版本, 就是用沸石添加剂, 来清除进入电池的水汽成分。

*Adding* a little aluminium 铝 *to* a nickel-cobalt 钴-manganese 锰 cathode 阴极, a type that *is widely used* in Li-ion batteries, *saves on* cobalt 钴, the most expensive ingredient 成分；（尤指烹饪）原料 in a battery. But the aluminium *delivers 发表；宣布；发布 other benefits as well*, *adds* Mr Grewe. It *boosts* the battery’s energy density, *meaning* a car *can travel farther* on a single charge. It also *makes the battery last(v.) longer*.

- aluminium : /ˌæljəˈmɪniəm,ˌæləˈmɪniəm/ 铝

- cobalt : /ˈkoʊbɔːlt/ ( symbol Co ) a chemical element. Cobalt is a hard silver-white metal, often mixed with other metals and used to give a deep blue-green colour to glass. 钴 +
=> 来自德语Kobald，捣蛋的妖精，来自kobe,小屋，-hold，友好的，该词义已不再使用，词源同inclined。原为矿工行话，当银矿含杂质过多时，矿工会咕哝一下这个词，表示倒霉，后来科学证明这种杂质主要元素为钴。 +
钴[gǔ] [1]  ，*元素符号Co*，银白色铁磁性金属，表面呈银白略带淡粉色.  *钴是具有光泽的钢灰色金属，比较硬而脆，有铁磁性*，加热到1150℃时磁性消失。*钴和钴化合物在2B类致癌物清单中。* +
*关于钴，在早期的中国就已知并用于陶器釉料，古代希腊人和罗马人曾利用它的化合物制造有色玻璃，生成美丽的深蓝色。* +
含钴的蓝色矿石辉钴矿CoAsS，中世纪在欧洲被称为kobalt，由于辉钴矿中含砷，妨害工人的身体健康. 。今天钴的拉丁名称cobaltum和元素符号Co正是德文中“妖魔”一词而来. +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/c/cobalt.jpg[100,100]

- manganese : /ˈmæŋɡəniːz/ ( symbol Mn ) a chemical element. Manganese is a grey-white metal that breaks easily, used in making glass and steel. 锰 +
是一种灰白色、硬脆、有光泽的过渡金属

- 在镍钴锰阴极(广泛应用于锂离子电池)中加入少量铝，可以节省电池中最昂贵的钴元素。但格雷威补充称，铝也带来了其他好处。它提高了电池的能量密度，这意味着汽车一次充电可以走得更远。它还能延长电池的使用寿命。


GM *will be using* these cathodes 阴极 in a new battery, called Ultium, that *it has developed* in partnership 合作关系；合作 with LG Chem, a South Korean firm. `主` Ultium batteries, production of which *is planned to start* next year at a factory in Ohio, `谓` *should provide* electric cars *with* single-charge ranges  （变动或浮动的）范围，界限，区间;（车辆）加一次油可行的路程; 射程；射击距离 of 650km or more. That *compares with* the 400km range (which *might [these days] reasonably be expected* from a mid-size electric car). *Asked* if the Ultium *is* a million-mile battery, Mr Grewe *replied*, “Many customers *could get that*.”

- 通用会将这些阴极, 使用在名为Ultium的新电池中. 该电池是通用与韩国LG化学公司合作开发的。Ultium电池, 计划明年在俄亥俄州的一家工厂开始生产，该电池将为电动汽车提供650公里或以上的单次充电里程。相比之下，如今一辆中型电动汽车的续航里程只有400公里, 而且这个距离还被认可。当被问及Ultium电池是否能续航百万英里时，格雷韦回答说:“很多客户都能买到这种电池。”

*As* `a marketing device` 手段；策略；方法；技巧;花招；计谋；诡计, the million-mile battery *will give* electric-car buyers -- even those *never likely to put*  开动；发动；使运行 a million miles *on the clock* 里程表；计程器 -- *more confidence that* their batteries *are robust*. But some users *might truly desire* a lifetime range (that *great*).

- *put sth on* : to switch on a piece of equipment 开动；发动；使运行 +
.. She *put on the brakes suddenly*. 她突然踩了刹车。
.. I'll *put the kettle on* for tea. 我来烧壶水, 好沏茶。


- 作为一种营销手段，百万英里电池将让电动汽车的购买者——即使是那些永远不可能行使百万英里的人——对自己的电池很有信心。但有些用户可能真的希望有这么大的数量范围。

What the million-mile battery means for electric cars

It is mainly about greater reliability

Aug 1st 2020 |


AS EVERY MOBILE-PHONE owner knows, after a year or so the battery starts to fade and the beast needs recharging more frequently. That is a nuisance, but a phone’s batteries can be replaced fairly cheaply—or the whole handset traded in for the latest model. An electric car, however, is a much bigger investment. And batteries are its priciest component, representing around 30% of an average mid-size vehicle. Apart from increasing the risk of running out of juice and leaving a driver stranded, a deteriorating battery quickly destroys a car’s second-hand value.

To provide buyers with some peace of mind, carmakers guarantee their batteries, typically for eight years or around 200,000km. Producers are now, though, planning to go much further than that, with the launch of “million mile” (1.6m kilometre) batteries. Zeng Yuqun, the boss of Contemporary Amperex Technology, a giant Chinese firm which produces batteries for a number of carmakers, said in June that his company was ready to start manufacturing batteries which would last for 16 years or 2m kilometres. Elon Musk has hinted that Tesla, a Californian maker of electric vehicles of which he is boss, has a million-mile battery in the works. Rumours suggest this could be unveiled in September. And over in Detroit, General Motors (GM) is in the final stages of developing an advanced battery which it says has similar longevity.

To the Moon and back, twice

“It’s a great catchphrase; the million-mile battery,” says George Crabtree, director of the Joint Centre for Energy Storage Research at Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago. “But the fact you can drive a million miles may not be the most relevant parameter to look at.” Thrash a car and its battery will deteriorate faster. Regular fast-charging also reduces battery life, as do overcharging and deep discharging. Driving in extremely hot or cold weather does not help either. And battery life will diminish even if you just leave the car in the garage. The real point of a million-mile battery is that the technological advances required to make it possible will deal with these things as well.

The lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries which power electric cars age in two ways: with time and with use. Battery-makers call time-dependent ageing “calendar ageing”. It is a consequence of the gradual degradation of some of the materials employed in battery construction. This degradation reduces a battery’s ability to hold a charge—though even here it is possible to ameliorate the problem to a certain extent. Leaving a car with a fully rather than partly charged battery, for example, can increase the rate of calendar ageing.

Use-dependent ageing is a consequence of the number of discharge-recharge cycles a battery goes through. It is caused by the complex chemical reactions that take place when a battery is operating. Some of these are essential to a battery’s job of storing and releasing energy. “But there are also side reactions that you can’t stop and some of those are harmful,” explains Dr Crabtree.

As a battery discharges, lithium ions (lithium atoms with an electron missing) are created at one electrode, the anode. These then shuttle through a liquid electrolyte to a second electrode, the cathode. The electrons stripped away at the anode, meanwhile, travel towards the cathode along an external electrical circuit, which powers the car. Ions and electrons are reunited at the cathode and remain there until the battery is plugged into a charger and the process is reversed.

Each cycle of discharge and recharge takes its toll. Lithium is so highly reactive that stopping it getting tied up in other chemical compounds while a battery is in use is hard. Even a small amount of diversion per cycle adds up, reducing the amount of the element available to store energy. On top of this, charging up faster than ions can be absorbed by the anode may result in a layer of lithium “plating” building up on the anode’s surface, reducing its storage capacity.

Plating becomes yet more of a problem if it leads to the development of structures called dendrites. These are small, finger-like fibres which project into the electrolyte from points on the anode where plating is especially elevated. If a dendrite reaches the cathode the battery will short-circuit, causing it to heat up rapidly and possibly catch fire. Other side reactions can have similarly adverse consequences.

It is difficult to generalise about the extent to which these processes reduce a battery’s lifetime. Not only does it depend on how that battery is used, but also how it is made. Li-ion cells come in different forms and a variety of chemistries, some of which have not been around long enough in cars for people to know for sure how long they will last. Nor is there any independent testing, says Dr Crabtree.

Nevertheless, the industry has a few rules of thumb. Once a battery’s capacity falls below 80% of its starting value, it is generally thought no longer suitable for use in vehicles. Some reckon that, on average, Li-ion batteries lose 2% of their capacity a year. This may not seem much, but by the time a vehicle is six years old it could mean it is halfway through its useful life.

The long road ahead

Battery technology is improving all the time. As a consequence, so are calendar and use-dependent lifetimes. Getting direct experience of how electric cars are used is helping researchers come up with ways to mitigate some of the side reactions, says Tim Grewe, the head of GM’s electrification strategy. The company employs remote, “telematic” monitoring to keep track of how batteries are performing in its cars, and also takes back some batteries from high-mileage drivers and those living in extreme environments, such as deserts and mountainous regions, for analysis.

Dealing with impurities which get into batteries helps to extend their lives. Water, for example, reacts with salts in the electrolyte to form an acid, which attacks the electrodes. To prevent this, GM has developed an additive made from a type of material called a zeolite. Zeolites are molecular sponges. GM’s version serves to mop up any moisture which enters a battery cell.

Adding a little aluminium to a nickel-cobalt-manganese cathode, a type that is widely used in Li-ion batteries, saves on cobalt, the most expensive ingredient in a battery. But the aluminium delivers other benefits as well, adds Mr Grewe. It boosts the battery’s energy density, meaning a car can travel farther on a single charge. It also makes the battery last longer.

GM will be using these cathodes in a new battery, called Ultium, that it has developed in partnership with LG Chem, a South Korean firm. Ultium batteries, production of which is planned to start next year at a factory in Ohio, should provide electric cars with single-charge ranges of 650km or more. That compares with the 400km range which might these days reasonably be expected from a mid-size electric car. Asked if the Ultium is a million-mile battery, Mr Grewe replied, “Many customers could get that.”

On to two million!

As a marketing device, the million-mile battery will give electric-car buyers—even those never likely to put a million miles on the clock—more confidence that their batteries are robust. But some users might truly desire a lifetime range that great.

Jeff Dahn, who leads a group of battery researchers at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, who are sponsored by Tesla, points out that autonomous electric vehicles like “robo taxis” could clock up vast mileages by operating around the clock. So, too, would long-haul lorries and electric buses. And some cars may end up being more than just means of transport. Plans are afoot to let electric-vehicle owners connect their jalopies to the grid in a way that will store surplus electricity generated in times of plenty by wind and sunshine and release it during hours of peak demand, with the owner collecting a fee for doing so. That means these grid-buffering vehicles will be racking up lots of charging cycles even when they are not moving.

Nor are million-mile batteries the limit of engineers’ aspirations. The next objective is to replace Li-ions’ liquid electrolytes with solid ones. That would keep the ions under stricter control and allow even longer driving ranges. This could make a two-million-mile battery a feasible objective. If that day comes, the tables would have been turned. From being the first part of a car to fail, its battery will have become the last.

*TO GET A good look at* Google, *climb a barren  贫瘠的；不毛的 hill* in front of the online giant’s Silicon Valley headquarters -- or rather, both of them. [To the right] *lies* the old HQ, a clump of low-slung 建得很低的；矮的 office buildings *ringed(v.)围住 by* dozens of similar boxes. [To the left] a brand-new 崭新的,全新的 corporate centre *is rising*. [From outside] it *resembles* an oversized circus tent 圆形马戏帐篷, but the inside *is still undetermined* 未决定的: pillars, wooden panelling （装饰墙壁、天花板等的）嵌板，饰块 and hardly any walls. The bare-bones 最基本的；降到最低限度的 structure *is meant* to provide(v.) architectural flexibility. This *will come in handy*  有用处 in a post-pandemic world in which offices will look quite different. “We’ll get a chance to reimagine(v.) it,” says Sundar Pichai, the boss of both Google and its parent company, Alphabet. And [just as the bricks-and-mortar 传统的实体企业,混凝土,建筑物 structure *is changing*], the organisation *is in transition* 转型;转变；变革, too.

- panelling  : n.   /ˈpænəlɪŋ/ ( BrE ) ( NAmE pan·el·ing ) [ U ] square or rectangular pieces of wood used to cover and decorate walls, ceilings, etc. （装饰墙壁、天花板等的）嵌板，饰块 +

- *come in handy* : (informal) to be useful 有用处
.. The extra money *came in very handy*. 这笔额外的钱正好派上了用场。

- 想要一睹谷歌的真容，可以爬上这家网络巨头硅谷总部前的一座荒山，或者更确切地说，爬上两家总部前的一座荒山。右边, 是旧的总部大楼，一堆低矮的办公大楼, 被几十个相似的的盒子包围着。在左边，一个全新的企业中心正在崛起。从外面看，它就像一个超大的马戏团帐篷，但内部的解构还没有被确定下来: 没有柱子、木镶板，而且几乎没有墙壁。保持这种最基本的结构, 是为了给予建筑的灵活性。这种灵活性, 能在疫情后的世界派上用场，在将来的这个世界，办公室看起来将与以前大不相同。谷歌及其母公司Alphabet的老板桑达尔·皮查伊(Sundar Pichai)说:“我们将有机会重新构想它。” 就在公司建筑的实体结构发生变化的同时，谷歌也在转型。


When Mr Pichai *took over as chief executive of Google* in August 2015, after *it became the core of* the newly formed Alphabet, the online-search-and-advertising business *had annual revenues of $66bn* and *net income of $14bn*. [By the time Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google’s founders, *handed him* 双宾 the reins 控制；主宰；掌管;缰绳 of Google’s parent company last December] his division  （机构的）部门 *was raking 耙；梳理;擦；刮；搔；抓 in profits of $34bn* [on sales of $161bn] -- and Alphabet was worth almost twice as much as four years earlier.

- 2015年8月，在谷歌成为新成立的Alphabet的核心之后，皮查伊出任该公司首席执行官。当时，谷歌的在线搜索和广告业务, 年营收为660亿美元，净利润为140亿美元。去年12月，当谷歌创始人谢尔盖•布林(Sergey Brin)和拉里•佩奇(Larry Page), 将谷歌母公司的控制权交给他时，他的部门销售额达1610亿美元，利润高达340亿美元，而Alphabet的市值几乎是4年前的两倍。

- 桑达尔·皮查伊（Sundar Pichai）: 2015年10月2日，Sundar Pichai 正式成为谷歌公司新任CEO。2019年12月，由于谷歌联合创始人拉里·佩奇（Larry Page）和谢尔盖·布林（Sergey Brin）将分别辞去母公司Alphabet CEO和总裁的职务，现任CEO桑达尔·皮查伊（Sundar Pichai）将接任，并同时担任母公司和谷歌的CEO。

This enviable 令人羡慕的；引起忌妒的 `track record` （个人或组织的）业绩记录 *justifies* Mr Pichai’s rich compensation package over several years, of $2m annual salary *plus* $240m in shares and stock options (depending on performance targets). It would also justify(v.) a degree of complacency 自满；自得；自鸣得意. Far from it. Mr Pichai *realises* he *inherited* an organisation (in the middle of momentous 关键的；重要的；重大的 change). That is *not just* because of ① the founders’ departure or ② the move next year into the new HQ, *but* for a deeper reason. As Alphabet has grown -- more than 4bn people *are thought to use*(v.) at least one of its products or services -- so *has the tug （突然的）猛拉，猛拽; 拖船 of economic and political forces* on it.

- *track record* :  n. all the past achievements, successes or failures of a person or an organization （个人或组织的）业绩记录

-  momentous /moʊˈmentəs/

- 这一令人艳羡的业绩记录, 证明皮查伊多年来的丰厚薪酬是合理的:200万美元的年薪，加上2.4亿美元的股票和股票期权(视业绩目标而定)。它还将为某种程度的自满提供理由。但远非如此。皮查伊意识到，他接手的这家公司正处于重大变革之中。这不仅是因为两位创始人的离职, 或明年谷歌将搬进新的总部，还有更深层次的原因。随着Alphabet的发展——据信有超过40亿人在使用其至少一种产品或服务——其经济和政治力量的影响力也在增强。


From the outside, lawmakers and trustbusters  要求解散托拉斯的人 *are pressing it* for explanations over alleged 所谓的；声称的；被断言的 abuses of its market dominance in online-search-and-advertising technology. On July 29th Mr Pichai *joined* his opposite numbers at Amazon, Apple and Facebook *to field*(v.)处理，应付（问题或意见） angry questions from a congressional committee *investigating* Big Tech’s alleged anticompetitive 反竞争的限制竞争的 practices (see article). On the inside, Google’s core businesses are maturing. [After The Economist *went to press*] Alphabet was expected to report(v.) the first year-on-year 与上年同期数字相比的 decline in quarterly revenues in its history, *hurt by* the pandemic-induced tightening of marketing budgets.

.. The BBC *had to field(v.) more than 300 phone calls* after last night's programme. 英国广播公司在昨夜的节目播出以后，不得不答复了300多次电话。

- 从外部来看，立法者和反托拉斯检察官, 正在敦促谷歌就其被指控滥用在线搜索和广告技术的市场主导地位, 做出解释。7月29日，皮查伊与其竞争对手 : 亚马逊、苹果和Facebook一道，回应了国会委员会对大型科技公司涉嫌反竞争行为的愤怒质询(见文章)。在内部，谷歌的核心业务正在成熟。在《经济学人》付印后，受疫情引发的营销预算紧水的影响，Alphabet预计将公布其历史上第一次季度收入同比上一年的下降。该公司以随心所欲著称的文化, 正变得越来越难以维持。


Mr Pichai’s foremost 最重要的；最著名的；最前的 challenge *is* `表` *to prevent(v.)

*To keep* hierarchies 等级制度 *flat*, Mr Brin and Mr Page *briefly went so far as to abolish(v.)废除，废止（法律、制度、习俗等） managers altogether*, though the experiment *had to be dialled(v.)拨（电话号码） back*. A compromise  妥协；折中；互让；和解;妥协（或折中）方案 *was* to give managers a minimum of seven direct reports *to limit(v.) the time* they have to loom(v.) over each underling 走卒；喽啰；手下；下属. They also *had limited time* to accost(v.)（贸然）上前搭讪；（唐突地）走近谈话 the two bosses, who at one point *got rid of* their personal assistants *to make it harder* to book(v.)（向旅馆、饭店、戏院等）预约，预订 time with them, *forcing* executives *to ambush(v.)伏击；埋伏 them* whenever they *appeared in public* to get a sign-off 签字认可；签名赞同;批准 on decisions.

- dial : /ˈdaɪəl/ v. 拨（电话号码） +
=>  来源于拉丁语dies(日)在中古拉丁语中派生的dialis(每日的)。 词根词缀： -di-日 + -al名词词尾

- accost : /əˈkɔːst/ v. [ VN ] ( formal ) to go up to sb and speak to them, especially in a way that is rude or threatening （贸然）上前搭讪；（唐突地）走近谈话 +
=> 英语单词accost在中文中常被翻译为“搭讪”，这是一种很不合适的译法，基本上没有体现accost一词的内在含义。准确地说，**accost指的是靠近陌生人，以一种粗鲁、挑衅的方式搭话，如妓女勾引嫖客，乞丐讨钱。**为什么？*这是因为accost原本是个军事用语，表示战舰逼近敌人的海岸线。* +
它源自拉丁语accostare，**由ad（趋近）+costa（肋骨，旁边）构成，而英语单词coast（海岸线）正是源自costa。**在一些英语新闻报道中，我们依然能看到accost的初始含义，如The PCG ship was attempting *to accost* the Guang Ta Hsin 28 and two other Taiwanese vessels.（菲律宾海岸警卫队舰艇正试图逼近广大兴28号及其他两艘台湾渔船。） +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/a/accost.jpg[100,100]

- ambush : /ˈæmbʊʃ/ v.n. [ VN ] to make a surprise attack on sb/sth from a hidden position 伏击 +
=> am（in）+bush（灌木丛）→躲在灌木丛中→埋伏

- *sign off on sth* : (North Amercian English,informal) to express your approval of sth formally and definitely 批准
.. The President *hasn't signed off on this report*. 这份报告总统尚未批准。

- 为了使等级制度扁平化，布林和佩奇曾一度将管理人员全部废除，尽管这个实验会被还原回去。一个折衷方案是，给经理们最小7次直接报告，以限制他们在每个下属面前出现的时间。他们与两位老板搭讪的时间也很有限，两位老板曾一度解雇了私人助理，以使与他们预约时间更难，这迫使高管们在布林和佩奇出现在公共场合时伏击他们，以获得他们在决策上的签字。


Cosmic 宇宙的;巨大且重要的 ambitions

Google *resembled* a big open-source project by *being* an `open book` 一目了然的事; 易于了解的人, at least internally. Any employee *could freely access* all internal information *except for* sensitive user data or company finances. All code, project documents, even a colleague’s 同事；同僚 calendar, *were* `fair game` 可开玩笑（或嘲弄、作弄）的对象. Workers *were encouraged* to use(v.) one of Google’s plethora(n.)过多；过量；过剩 of messaging tools, such as mailing lists (of which there *are* now more than a million). They *were also expected* to ask(v.) tough 艰苦的；艰难的；棘手的 questions [at weekly `company-wide 全公司的；公司性的 town-hall 市政厅 meetings`] *with 与…对立；反对 the founders*, *called* TGIF, for “*Thank God* It’s Friday” (now *held* on Thursdays *to allow* Googlers around the world *to participate* without *having to get up* on Saturday morning). Grievances 不平的事；委屈；抱怨；牢骚 *were* to be kept within the company’s walls. `主` *Leaking*, particularly *to* the press, `系` *was* a sackable 犯规并可构成解雇理由的 offence 违法行为；犯罪；罪行. But the place *was also meant*(v.) to be playful; *hence* 因此；由此 the playground-like offices, ping-pong tables and the like.

- *open book* : N a person or thing without secrecy or concealment that can be easily known or interpreted 一目了然的事; 易于了解的人

- *fair game* : n.[ U ] if a person or thing is said to be fair game , it is considered acceptable to play jokes on them, criticize them, etc. 可开玩笑（或嘲弄、作弄）的对象
.. The younger teachers were considered *fair game* by most of the kids. 多数小孩认为年轻教师是可作弄的对象。 +
=> 在fair game这个习惯用语里，*这个 game不是指游戏，而是指猎物*，也就是打猎人要打的动物。所以，fair game，作为俗语，它的意思也就是：可能成为被打击，被虐待或嘲笑的人或者东西。比如说，一个刚到一所新学校去上学的男孩很可能会成为那些老学生们开玩笑的对象；他们可以逗他，开他的玩笑，总之把他弄的日子很难过。

- TGIF : Thank God (or "goodness")it's Friday 感谢老天爷可算是到了星期五了 +

- 早在1999年，谷歌联合创始人拉里·佩奇（Larry Page）和赛吉·布林（Sergey Brin）创立了TGIF全员大会，以此作为一个论坛，**员工可以定期表达自己的担忧，并与管理层自由开放地讨论话题。**2019年, 改为每月举行一次，重点讨论公司的业务和战略。有分析人士称，TGIF大会改成每月举办一次，正值谷歌打压曾经十分开放的企业文化之际。开放的企业文化曾是谷歌的一个重要特色，员工可以对各种问题自由探讨。 +
但如今，**员工们越来越多地表达了他们对许多问题的关注，从性骚扰的处理到政府的雇佣和合同。**最近几个月，员工们还向媒体泄露了会议记录，这表明高管和员工之间的紧张关系日益加剧。 +
今年夏天，**谷歌称将禁止在内部信息论坛讨论政治话题。**10月下旬，CEO桑德尔·皮查伊（Sundar Pichai）在一段泄露的视频中表示，谷歌正失去一些员工的信任。皮查伊还称，在任何特定的一周，只有25%的谷歌员工关注TGIF全员大会，而十年前这一比例为80%。

.. KIT = Keep In Touch 保持联系
.. LD = Long Distance 长途, 情深说话未曾讲
.. LMK = Let Me Know 告诉我

- 谷歌就像一个大型的开源项目，能一目了然. 至少在内部是这样。除敏感用户数据或公司财务信息外，任何员工都可以自由访问所有内部信息。所有的代码、项目文档，甚至是同事的日程表，都是可以成为被作弄的对象。员工们被鼓励使用谷歌的众多消息传递工具之一，比如mailing lists(现在已经有超过100万个mailing lists)。在每周举行的全公司"市政厅"会议上，员工们被期待向创始人提出尖锐的问题。这称之为 TGIF, 即“感谢上帝，今天是周五”. (现在, 这个活动改到了周四进行, 为的是全世界各地的谷歌员工都能参加进来, 而不用在周六早上起床). 对公司的怨气, 被在公司内部讨论消化掉。泄密出去，特别是向媒体泄密，就违反了公司规章, 并会被合理解雇。但这个地方也意味着会很好玩;于是就有了像操场一样的办公室、乒乓球桌等等。


[*From* Stanford] Mr Brin and Mr Page *borrowed* the idea of *letting* people *follow(v.) their passions*. Google employees *were allowed* to spend(v.) 20% of their time *working on* what they *thought* would most benefit(v.) the firm, *even if* `主` that `谓` *often led to them working 120%*. They *also often set(v.) their own quarterly  季度的；每季的 goals*. Recruiting  招聘 and promotion 晋升 *were similar to* academia, too. Candidates *were graded 给…评分；给…分数 like PhD students* and `主` decisions about *who should move up 上涨;升级;升迁 the corporate ladder* `谓` *were taken* by a committee of peers  身份（或地位）相同的人；同龄人；同辈 *from* across the company, *rather than* individual managers, who often *promote* people (they *like*) *rather than* those who would do the best job.

- 布林和佩奇借用了斯坦福的理念，让人们追随自己的激情。谷歌的员工被允许将20%的时间, 花在他们认为对公司最有利的事情上，即使这通常会让他们工作120%的时间。他们也经常设定自己的季度目标。他们的招聘和晋升, 也与学术界中的方式相似。求职者就像博士生一样被评分，关于谁应该在公司晋升的决定, 是由整个公司的同事组成的委员会做出的，而不是由个别经理做出的决定。因为这些经理通常会提拔自己喜欢的人，而不是那些工作表现最好的人。

[*Having created* most of this unique structure in 2001] the founders *recruited* Eric Schmidt, a Silicon Valley veteran who *understood* both managers and technologists, *to help implement it* -- or, *as* they themselves *put it*, *to provide* “adult supervision” 监督,监理,监管. *To shield* the setup 体制; 组织方式 *from* potential shareholder pressure, the three of them *built a legal moat* 护城河；壕沟 around it. Google *was* one of the first Big Tech companies *to opt for* dual-class shares 双重投票权股票,双重股权, which *gave* the original shareholders *ten times* the voting power. Although Messrs Page, Brin and Schmidt together *held(v.) only a small stake*, they *retained* an outsized 特大的，特大号的 38% of voting rights. The founders *warned* [in “An Owner’s Manual” for Google’s shareholders, *published* before the firm’s `initial public offering` 首次公开募股, 首次公开发行 in 2004], *that* new investors “*will have little ability* to influence(v.) its strategic decisions *through their voting rights*”.

- moat : /moʊt/ =>  来自古法语mote,城墙，护堤，来自拉丁语mota,城墙，小山，山上城堡，来自Proto-Germanic*muto,泥土，污泥，来自PIE*smut,污泥的，脏的，词源同smut,mud.后词义由城墙过渡到护城河。

- 在2001年创建了这种独特结构的大部分之后，两位创始人聘请了埃里克•施密特(Eric Schmidt)来帮助实施——或者，用他们自己的话说，提供“成人监督”。施密特是硅谷的资深人士，既懂管理，也懂技术。为了保护公司免受潜在股东的压力，三巨头在公司周围筑起了一条合法的护城河。谷歌是首批选择双重股权结构的大型科技公司之一，这给了原始股东10倍的投票权。尽管佩奇、布林和施密特一共只持有一小部分股份，但他们仍然拥有巨大的38%的投票权。在2004年谷歌首次公开发行之前，公司创始人在给股东的“所有者手册”中警告说，新投资者“将没有能力通过他们的投票权, 来影响公司的战略决策”。


Mr Page *took over* 接收，接管(公司);接替;接任;接手 from Mr Schmidt *as Google’s CEO* in 2011 (though Mr Schmidt *remained* Alphabet’s executive chairman until 2018), before *handing over to* Mr Pichai four years later. Since then Mr Pichai *has managed* Google [*in much the same way* 以差不多的方式;大致同样 that previously he *ran* Chrome], Google’s web browser, and other projects. *Rather than* *getting(v.) bogged down 使某人╱某物陷进烂泥（或泥沼）;妨碍；阻碍 in details*, he *put* trusted people *in charge*, *giving them resources* and *nudging （用肘）轻推，轻触;（朝某方向）轻推，渐渐推动 them along*.

- bog  沼泽（地区） +
=> 词源同bow, 弯。形容沼泽软泥般的容易陷进去。

- *bog(v.) sth/sb down (in sth)*
[ usually passive ] +
1. to make sth sink into mud or wet ground 使某人╱某物陷进烂泥（或泥沼） +
-> The tank *became bogged(v.) down in mud*. 坦克陷入了烂泥中。 +
2. to prevent sb from making progress in an activity 妨碍；阻碍 +
-> We mustn't *get bogged(v.) down in details*. 我们一定不能因细节问题误事。 +

- 佩奇于2011年接替施密特, 担任谷歌首席执行官(尽管施密特在2018年之前一直担任Alphabet的执行主席)，四年后移交给皮查伊。从那时起，皮查伊管理谷歌的方式, 与他之前管理谷歌网络浏览器Chrome和其他项目的方式, 大体相同。他没有陷入细节的泥潭，而是让值得信赖的人负责，给他们提供资源，并推动他们前进。

The result *is* a collection of semi-independent firms *with* powerful bosses *sitting atop 在…顶上 each of them*: Thomas Kurian *at* Google Cloud, Susan Wojcicki *at* YouTube, Rick Osterloh *at* Google’s hardware division and Hiroshi Lockheimer *at* the Android operation. In early June Mr Pichai *put* Prabhakar Raghavan, who already *headed* Google’s ad business, *in charge of* search *as well*, *making him* Google’s `de facto` 实际上存在的（不一定合法）;（法）实际上的 deputy CEO. (Mustafa Suleyman, vice-president of AI policy at Google, *sits on* the board of The Economist’s parent company.) A company of Alphabet’s breadth 宽度;（知识、兴趣等的）广泛 *would fail* [if it *depended solely on* one man’s judgment], Mr Pichai *explains*. “People *have to be able to make their own decisions*.”

- *de facto* : /ˌdeɪ ˈfæktoʊ/ a. [ usually before noun ] ( from Latin formal ) existing as a fact although it may not be legally accepted as existing 实际上存在的（不一定合法）
.. The general *took de facto control of the country*. 这位将军实际上控制了整个国家。

- breadth : /bredθ/ n. the distance or measurement from one side to the other; how broad or wide sth is 宽度 / a wide range (of knowledge, interests, etc.) （知识、兴趣等的）广泛
.. She estimated *the breadth of the lake* to be 500 metres. 她估计湖面大约有500米宽。
.. The curriculum *needs breadth and balance*. 课程设置应该内容广泛而且均衡。

- 结果就是造就了一群半独立的公司，每家公司都有强大的老板：谷歌云的托马斯·库里安(Thomas Kurian)，YouTube的苏珊·沃西基(Susan Wojcicki)，谷歌硬件部门的里克·奥斯特罗(Rick Osterloh)，以及安卓业务的博希·洛克海默(Hiroshi Lockheimer)。6月初，皮查伊让已经领导谷歌广告业务的普拉巴卡尔·拉加万(Prabhakar Raghavan)也负责搜索业务，使他成为谷歌事实上的副首席执行官。(谷歌负责人工智能政策的副总裁穆斯塔法·苏莱曼(Mustafa Suleyman), 是“经济学人”母公司的董事会成员)。皮查伊解释说，像Alphabet这样广博的公司，如果仅仅依靠一个人的判断，就会倒闭。“人们必须有权能够自己做决定。”

These decisions *are becoming harder*. Googlers *have always prided themselves on* solving(v.) the toughest problems in computer science -- less so *on* making money. *This may be one reason* why some of the company’s hit  很受欢迎的人（或事物） services(n.) *generate(v.) smaller revenues* than they might, like YouTube, or barely *any [at all]*, like Maps 谷歌地图. Monetisation 货币化 from the “other bets” *has scarcely begun*. They *racked 使痛苦不堪；使受折磨 up* 累积；聚集（某物）；累计（得分） more than $5bn in losses in the four quarters to March. Only Access and Verily *bring in material revenues*. Some *could one day turn into huge businesses*: Waymo *was valued at about $30bn* when it *raised outside capital* this spring. But even that impressive figure 数字 *is much less than earlier estimates*, which *valued* the autonomous-driving 自主驾驶,自动驾驶 unit *at* more than $100bn.

- hit : n. a person or thing that is very popular 很受欢迎的人（或事物）

.. The company *racked up $200 million in losses* in two years. 公司两年内损失累计达2亿元。

- 这些决定正变得越来越困难。谷歌人总是以解决计算机科学中最棘手的问题为荣，而不是以赚钱为荣。这可能是为什么该公司的一些热门服务(如YouTube)的收入低于预期, 或几乎没有任何收入(比如谷歌地图)的原因之一。“其他下注”的业务的变现化, 几乎还没有开始。在截至3月份的四个季度里，他们累计亏损超过50亿美元。只有Access和Verly子公司才带来物质收入。其中一些公司有朝一日可能会变成大企业：Waymo在今年春天筹集外部资本时的估值约为300亿美元。但即便是这一令人印象深刻的数字，也远低于早先的估计，后者对自动驾驶部门的估值超过1000亿美元。

None of this *used to matter much*, as long as Google’s ad products *were* “a gold-threaded （棉、毛、丝等的）线;螺纹 safety net *underneath* 在…底下；隐藏（或掩盖）在下面 every daring innovation”, *as* Steven Levy, one of Silicon Valley’s *scribes*, put it in 2011. *It becomes a problem* when it translates into lower margins and weaker stockmarket performance *than* rival tech giants (see chart 3 and chart 4).

Online advertising overall *is far from* a mature market, but `主` growth in search ads, which *continue* to generate(v.) about 60% of Alphabet’s revenues, `谓` *has slowed*. In 2019 sales *expanded by 15%*, a healthy clip *but* considerably lower than the 22% a year earlier. General online search *is also being “hollowed out”* 挖空（某物）；挖出（孔、洞） by specialised searches, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a research firm. Mr Shmulik *estimates that* about 60% of product searches now *start* on Amazon (whose fast-growing online-ad business *is* already the world’s third-biggest *behind* Google and Facebook).

- *hollow sth out* +
1. to make a hole in sth by removing part of it 挖空（某物）；挖出（孔、洞） +
-> *Hollow out the cake* and fill it with cream. 在蛋糕上挖个洞，填入奶油。 +
2. to form sth *by making a hole in sth else* 挖洞（成某物） +

*Spaced out* 使拉开间距；使隔开; 精神恍惚，神志迷糊（常因吸毒）

Alphabet’s engineer-driven bottom-up culture *is also showing signs of age*. It *can be hit and miss*. “You *can paper(v.) over 糊壁纸遮盖;暂时掩盖，权且掩饰（问题或分歧） a lot of problems* by *throwing money at it* and *hiring more bodies*,” says a long-time 为时甚久的 Googler, who previously *worked for* Microsoft, which *was regularly scooped 抢先报道;用勺儿舀；用铲儿铲 by Google* *when it came to* 当涉及某事（或做某事）时 new products. “I *thought* they *must have* really clever strategists,” he *recalls*, *only to discover* [on 就在…之后；一…就 *joining the firm*] *that* it “*had* hundreds of things *happening in parallel*”.

- *space out* : ( informal ) ( especially NAmE ) to take no notice of what is happening around you, especially as a result of taking drugs 精神恍惚，神志迷糊（常因吸毒）
——see also spaced out

- *space sth out* : to arrange things with a wide space between them 使拉开间距；使隔开

- *slime mould* : N any of various simple spore-producing organisms typically found as slimy masses on rotting vegetation, where they engulf food particles by amoeboid movements. Formerly regarded as fungi, they are now classified as protoctists of the phyla Myxomycota (true, or cellular slime moulds) or Acrasiomycota (plasmodial slime moulds) 粘液菌

- aggregate : v. to collect or gather into a mass or whole /  to amount to (a whole sum or total) : TOTAL

- Alphabet由工程师驱动的自下而上的文化, 也显示出了衰老的迹象。它可能成功, 也可能失败. “你可以通过砸钱和雇佣更多员工, 来掩盖很多问题，”一位曾在微软工作过的资深谷歌员工说。当涉及新产品时，微软经常被谷歌抢占先机。“我原以为他们(谷歌)一定有非常聪明的战略师，”他回忆道，但加入公司后才发现,谷歌中“有数以百计的事情在同时进行开发”。Alphabet的高管们经常把他们公司的结构比作“黏菌”——一种以单细胞形式生存，但必须聚集起来才能繁殖的有机体。


Innovation can indeed *mushroom*(v.)快速生长；迅速增长; 蘑菇 in such a corporate ecosystem. But it *may hinder*  阻碍；妨碍；阻挡 the development of more structured products, which *require* more sustained co-operation and a strategic vision 想象力；眼力；远见卓识. *This is particularly true* of lucrative(a.)赚大钱的；获利多的 enterprise offerings 用品；剧作；作品；供消遣的产品, where corporate clients *expect* providers *to be [both] consistent [and] responsive(a.)反应敏捷；反应积极 to their needs*. Google *has* a reputation for being neither.

- 在这样的企业生态系统中, 创新确实可以迅速发展。但这可能会阻碍"更具有结构化的产品"的发展，而这些产品需要更持久的合作和战略眼光。对于那些能给公司带来丰厚利润的企业产品, 尤其如此，其客户希望产品开发商能够长久地提供服务, 并迅速积极地响应他们的求助需求。谷歌被认为两者都没做到。


[Over the years 多年以来] Google *has churned 剧烈搅动；（使）猛烈翻腾 out* （粗制滥造地）大量生产，大量炮制 new messaging tools, *from* Allo and Buzz *to* Hangouts and Meet, only recently *starting to develop* a unified communications *offering for corporations*, *similar to* Slack or Microsoft Teams. Google’s cloud business *has often been criticised for* “not *having a customer-service bone in its body* 毫无…的素质”, says Brent Thill of Jefferies, a bank. *As a result* it *lags(v.) behind* Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure, where customer service *verges(v.) on* 极接近；濒于 an obsession  痴迷；着魔；困扰;使人痴迷的人（或物）.

- *not have a ... bone in your body* : to have none of the quality mentioned 毫无…的素质
.. She was honest and hard-working, and *didn't have an unkind bone in her body*. 她诚实勤劳，身上没有一点儿不好的气质。

- *verge(v.) on sth* : to be very close to an extreme state or condition 极接近；濒于 / verge : n. （路边的）小草地，绿地
SYN border on sth
.. Some of his suggestions *verged(v.) on the outrageous*. 他的一些建议都快到了荒唐的地步。

- 在过去的几年里，谷歌大量生产新的信息工具，从Allo和Buzz到Hangouts和Meet，直到最近才开始为企业开发统一的通信产品，类似于Slack或微软的Teams。Jefferies银行的Brent Thill说，谷歌的云业务经常被批评为“毫无为客户服务的素质存在”。其结果是，它落后于亚马逊网络服务(Amazon Web Services)和微软Azure，后者的客户服务令人几近痴迷。


*It is also becoming increasingly apparent that* Alphabet’s organisational setup(n.)体制; 组织方式 *does not scale 改变…的大小;攀登；到达…顶点 well*. [Even with a workforce 全体员工 of a few tens of thousands] Google *felt small*, *notes* an employee who *left* a few years ago and *later returned*. With the firms’ 120,000 permanent workers(n.) *complemented 补充；补足；使完美；使更具吸引力 by* an even more numerous (and less-well-paid) temporary or contract staff, the founders’ original idiosyncratic  怪异的; 另类的 rules(n.) *are becoming a drag* 累赘；拖累；绊脚石;（作用于飞机或其他运载工具的）空气阻力. Executives *grumble that* internal promotion by committee *is* often a time-consuming political exercise. `主` *Letting* a thousand flowers *bloom* `谓` *is leading to* an awful 很坏的；极讨厌的;骇人听闻的；可怕的 lot of compost 混合肥料；堆肥.

- idiosyncratic :  /ˌɪdiə-sɪŋˈkrætɪk/  ADJ If you describe someone's actions or characteristics as idiosyncratic, you mean that *they are somewhat unusual*. 怪异的; 另类的
.. ...*a highly idiosyncratic personality*. ...一种非常另类的个性。

- 同样越来越明显的是，Alphabet的组织架构不太适合调整组织规模。一位几年前离开谷歌, 后又回来的员工指出，即使拥有几万员工，谷歌也感觉规模不大。谷歌有着12万名固定员工，再加上数量更多(薪水更低)的临时或合同工，创始人最初制定的特殊规则, 现在正在成为拖累。高管们抱怨说，通过委员会来得到内部晋升, 常常是一种耗费时间的政治活动。同时开一千朵花, 只会造成大量的化肥存在。

Size *creates* political tensions, too. [After 2016] the firm’s mostly woke(a.)意识到并积极关注重要的事实和问题(特别是种族和社会正义问题) workforce *began using* internal messaging tools *to organise* and *press*(v.) management *to take action on* everything [from] President Donald Trump’s harsh immigration policy [to] *boycotting* meat(n.) in its cafeterias 自助餐厅；自助食堂. *As* Alphabet *has hired engineers [at breakneck 飞速惊险的;极快的 speed]*, it is no longer “a country (where everybody *politically agrees” with* the once-dominant liberal bent 自由主义倾向), says an insider.

- woke : a. woker; wokest : aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice) 意识到并积极关注重要的事实和问题(特别是种族和社会正义问题)
.. *stay woke*(a.)

- 人数规模也会带来政治紧张。2016年之后，谷歌中最有社会意识的员工, 开始用内部的信息工具, 来组织, 并对管理层试压，来对各种问题采取行动, 从唐纳德·特朗普严厉的移民政策, 到抵制谷歌公司内餐厅的肉类等。一位内部人士表示，随着Alphabet以极快的速度聘请新的工程师，它不再是一个这样一个王国了, 即“所有人在政治上都赞同”曾经占主导地位的"自由主义倾向"。

- fester => 来自PIE*bheid, 撕开，裂开，词源同bite, bitter, fissure. 该词用来指化脓。

- dox :  /dɑːks/ vt. 人肉搜索，肉搜（未经允许在网上非法获得并发布他人个人信息，同 doxx）

- 2017年，这种紧张关系达到了顶峰。谷歌软件工程师詹姆斯·达莫尔(James Damore)在一个内部邮件列表上, 发表了一份备忘录，称科技行业缺乏性别多样性，部分原因是可以用生物差异来解释。在此事被泄露给媒体后，他被解雇了，但许多内部人士认为，包括皮查伊在内的管理层, 让这场争论愈演愈演，并且对那些被其他员工进行“人肉搜索”(让他们的个人信息在网上公布)伤害的积极分子员工, 管理层没有提供足够帮助。

- 如果谷歌对歧视处理不当，那么优步的前车之鉴很有可能在谷歌身上重演。优步根据调查结果开除了20名员工，解雇理由包括性骚扰、欺侮、报复以及歧视。甚至连优步创始人特拉维斯•卡兰尼克（Travis Kalanick）也间接因为此事离开了优步。

Things *went downhill* from there. Once unthinkable leaks(n.) 漏洞；裂缝；缝隙;泄漏出的液体（或气体）;（秘密信息的）透露 *multiplied*. *So did* internal petitions 请愿书.

- 从那时起，事情开始走下坡路。原本曾经难以想象的人事等漏洞问题, 在谷歌中成倍增加。内部请愿也是如此。2018年，活跃分子员工, 迫使谷歌不再与五角大楼续签人工智能合同，并放弃了"带有审查性的谷歌搜索引擎的中国版本"的计划。当年晚些时候，双方的紧张关系达到了顶峰，当时有消息称，被控性骚扰的业绩优异的高管被解雇，但他获得了数百万美元的离职补偿。对此, 全球超过2万名谷歌员工举行罢工, 以示抗议。



“The walkout *broke(v.) Larry’s heart*,” says one Googler. It *suggested that* `主` the goal of *creating* an engineers’ commune `谓` *had failed*. [After that] the two founders *put more distance between themselves and their creation*. They *stopped attending the TGIF meetings*. In many ways Mr Pichai’s ascent(n.)上升；升高；登高 to the top job last year *was a formality*(n.)正式手续; 例行公事.

- “这次罢工伤透了拉里的心(Larry Page是Google公司的创始人之一,2019年12月4日，谷歌联合创始人拉里·佩奇宣布，将控制权转交给谷歌首席执行高管桑达尔·皮猜 Sundar Pichai)，”一位谷歌员工说。这表明，创建工程师社区的目标已经失败。在那之后，两位创始人把他们自己和他们的作品分开了。他们停止参加TGIF会议。从许多方面来看，皮查伊去年晋升最高职位只是一种形式。


Although Mr Brin, Mr Page and Mr Schmidt *remain* Alphabet’s biggest individual shareholders -- with 13.1% of shares and 56.7% of voting rights -- a former senior executive *says that* the company *is now run(v.) by* a different triumvirate 三人领导小组；三人统治集团；三方执政集团. Besides Mr Pichai it includes Kent Walker, senior vice-president of global affairs, and Ruth Porat, the finance chief *poached(v.)盗用；挖走（人员等）;（在他人地界）偷猎，偷捕 from* Morgan Stanley, an investment bank. Where Mr Brin and Mr Page *were* technologists 技术专家；工艺师 and Mr Schmidt a technologist-manager, the new team *are* simply managers.

- triumvirate : /traɪˈʌmvərət/ => 来自拉丁语 trium,三，词源同 three,-vir,男人，词源同 virile,virtue.引申词义三人领导小组。

- poach : /poʊtʃ/ => 词源不确定，可能来自法语pocher,装入口袋，词源同poach.或来自古法语pochier,刺，捅， 词源同poke.引申词义越界，偷猎，偷捕。

- 虽然布林、佩奇和施密特, 仍然是Alphabet最大的个人股东--拥有13.1%的股份, 和56.7%的投票权--但一位前高管表示，该公司现在由另一个三巨头经营。除了皮查伊，还包括负责全球事务的高级副总裁肯特·沃克(Kent Walker), 和从投资银行摩根士丹利(Morgan Stanley)挖来的首席财务官露丝·波拉特(Ruth Porat)。以前的布林先生和佩奇先生是技术专家，施密特先生是技术专家兼经理，而新的三巨头团队中, 所有人的出身都是纯粹的管理者, 而没有技术人员出身存在。

This transformation *was apparent* at Mr Pichai’s first `quarterly earnings call` 季度财报盈收电话会议 *as* the boss of Alphabet in February, when he *delighted(v.)使高兴；使愉快；使快乐 analysts* 分析师 [by *at long last* （经过长时间的延误或努力等之后）终于，最终 breaking out 突然开始；爆发 YouTube’s revenues ($15bn in 2019, *up by more than a third* from the previous year)].

- *at (long) last* : after much delay, effort, etc.; in the end （经过长时间的延误或努力等之后）终于，最终
=finally
.. *At last* we're home! 我们终于到家了！


- 这种转变, 在皮查伊2月份就任Alphabet老板后的第一次季度财报电话会议上, 表现得很明显，当时他终于公布了YouTube的收入(2019年为150亿美元，同比增长逾三分之一)，这让分析师们感到高兴。他还加快了股票回购速度，从2019年第四季度的61亿美元, 增加到截至3月份的85亿美元。杰富瑞的蒂尔表示：“从股东的角度来看，它们不再是最令人讨厌的大型科技公司。”

Alphabet *is also becoming shareholder-friendlier* in how it *manages* its other bets. Some of the subsidiaries 子公司, like Waymo, *have wooed*(v.)争取…的支持；寻求…的赞同;追求（异性）；求爱 outside investors, *suggesting that* they *will one day be spun(v.) off* 从…脱离出来（组建新公司）. `主` Others, such as ① Chronicle, which *hoped* to revolutionise(v.) 彻底改变；完全变革 cyber-security, and ② Jigsaw, a think-tank, `谓` *have been folded back into* Google. `主` Yet others, like Makani, which *is developing* flying wind turbines 涡轮机 *to generate energy*, `系` *are likely to be shut down or sold*.

- woo => 词源不详，可能来自古英语 wog,弯曲，弯腰，引申词义恭敬，求爱。

- Alphabet在管理其他押注(投资的业务)的方式上, 也变得对股东更加友好。一些子公司，如Waymo，已经向外部投资者示好，暗示他们终有一天会被分拆出来独立。其他的，比如Chronicle公司, 它希望彻底改变网络安全; 还有Jigsaw, 是一家智库，它们都已经被重新合并到了谷歌内部。然而，像Makani这样的其他公司，很可能会被关闭或出售。Makani正在开发用于发电的飞行风力涡轮机。

.. *stark differences* 鲜明的区别 +
=> 《权力的游戏》中的史塔克（Stark）家族所在的北方大陆，长年积雪，环境严酷，也许正是因此得名。词根-star-指“硬”，环境很硬即不温柔，因而严酷，正如hard既指“硬”又指“困难的”。starch（淀粉；上浆）同源，人们用淀粉为织物上浆，使其变得硬挺。 +

- *a passing fad* 一时流行的风尚一时的流行 +
=> fad : 英语单词fad表示“一时流行的狂热、一时的爱好”，其来源未知，不过有一种虽然不真实，却能有效帮助我们理解并记忆这个单词的说法，那就是把它看做是for a day（仅仅持续一天）的首字母组合。另外，fad与fade（逐渐消失）拼写很接近，在词义上也可以产生关联，即：fad就是很快就会fade的狂热或爱好。 fad：[fæd] n.时尚，一时流行的狂热，一时的爱好 faddish：['fædɪʃ] adj.风行的，流行一时的

- ramp : n. a slope that joins two parts of a road, path, building, etc. when one is higher than the other 斜坡；坡道 / a slope or set of steps that can be moved, used for loading a vehicle or getting on or off a plane （装车或上下飞机的）活动梯，活动坡道 +

- 皮查伊对管理层的改组, 在谷歌云上表现得最为明显。五年前，当他成为谷歌的老板后，云计算显然不仅仅是昙花一现。他加大了对该部门的投资，并在2018年聘请了库里安, 来运营该部门。库里安曾在大型企业软件制造商甲骨文(Oracle)担任高管。与皮查伊不断发展的管理哲学相一致的是，库里安获得了比前任戴安•格林(Diane Greene)大得多的自主权，并将该部门变成了一个自上而下的组织，并从他的前雇主以及德国的竞争对手SAP公司那里, 招募员工。


*It seems to be working*. `主` Google’s cloud business, which *includes* G Suite, its package （必须整体接收的）一套东西，一套建议；一揽子交易 of professional online services, `谓` *is growing at more than 50% a year*. Revenues *are expected to reach $13bn* this year, *contributing* 8% *to* Alphabet’s total.

- 它似乎起作用了。谷歌的云业务，包括其专业在线服务套餐G Suite，以每年超过50%的速度增长。今年的收入预计将达到130亿美元，占Alphabet总收入的8%。


However, Mr Kurian’s financial success *carries a risk*. Insiders *report* a mini-exodus （大批人同时）离开，外出，出去 from the cloud unit *to* other parts of Alphabet. Plenty of employees *worry that* the top-down-approach from Google’s cloud business *will spread throughout the organisation*. Many *are beginning to grumble about* getting tasks(n.) *handed down from above* with a deadline.

- exodus : n.  /ˈeksədəs/ [sing. ]
or
( formal ) *~ (from...) (to...)* ( humorous ) a situation in which many people leave a place at the same time （大批人同时）离开，外出，出去 +
=> ex-, 向外。-od, 走，离开，词源同cede, anode, method. +
前缀ex表“向外”；词根od表“路”，这个词根有两个形式，od和hod，od的出现频率似乎更大。method（方法）是同根词，前缀met表“在后方”，hod表“路，way”，字面义为“紧随其后的路径”。“方法”是达到目标的“路径”，相似逻辑如way（路；方法）。 +
.. *the mass exodus(n.) from Paris to the country* in the summer 夏日大批人从巴黎外出到乡村 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/e/exodus.jpg[100,100]

- 然而，库里安在财务上的成功也存在风险。内部人士报告说，有一小部分人从云部门跳槽到Alphabet的其他部门。很多员工担心谷歌云业务的自上而下的做法, 会在整个公司蔓延开来。许多人开始抱怨上级下达的任务有最后期限。


That *hints* at a bigger unsolved problem with Google’s culture. After the walkouts, management *made some tweaks* 扭；拧；扯;（对机器、系统等的）轻微调整. “When we were smaller, we all *worked as one team*, on one product, and everyone *understood* how business decisions were made. It’s harder to give a company of over 100,000 people the full context on everything,” Mr Walker *reportedly wrote* in November *in an internal newsletter* （某组织的）内部通讯，简讯. The TGIF meetings *are now held only once a month* and *limited to* business-related questions. ① The largest internal mailing lists *are moderated* 缓和；使适中;审核评分（查看不同阅卷人所打分数是否公平一致） and ② `主` postings(n.) *deemed* too political `谓` *are allegedly 依其申述；据说，据称 being taken down* 拆掉；拆除；拆卸. [These days] employees *are being told* to access(v.) sensitive documents *only if* they “need to know”. Some staff *talk of* creating(v.) if not a labour union, then *at least* a group *to defend*(v.) their interests.

- 这暗示了谷歌文化中一个更大的未解决的问题。罢工后，管理层做了一些调整。“当我们还小的时候，我们都作为一个团队，在一个产品上工作，每个人都知道商业决策是如何做出的。要给一家拥有10万多名员工的公司提供所有事情的完整背景就更难了，”据报道，沃克在去年11月的一份内部通讯中写道。TGIF会议现在一个月只举行一次，而且仅限于与商业有关的问题。最大的内部邮件列表被审核，那些被认为过于政治化的帖子据说会被撤下。如今，员工被告知只有在“需要知道”的情况下才可以访问敏感文件。一些员工谈到，即使不建立一个工会，也至少要建立一个组织, 来保护他们的利益。

.. There have been demonstrations on the streets *in the wake of* the recent bomb attack. 在近来的炸彈袭击之后，大街上随即出现了示威游行。

- 在乔治•弗洛伊德(George Floyd)被杀之后，许多谷歌员工批评其高管在让公司变得更加多元化方面做得太少、太晚;几周后，该公司承诺将在未来五年内将“未被充分代表的群体中的领导层人数”提高30%。6月，2000多名员工联名给皮查伊写了一封公开信，要求该公司停止向美国各地的警察部队出售其技术。

=> 来自印度语。 +
.. a cushy job 不费心劳神的工作


- 在过去的几周里，内部局势似乎已经平静下来。但这种喘息可能只是表面上的。据一名谷歌员工报道，许多员工因为害怕被解雇而三缄其口。几乎没有人愿意在经济衰退中失去一份轻松的工作。活动家们现在避开了该公司的通讯工具，并在网上其他地方组织起来。

All this *fuels*(v.) murmurings 低语 and speculation  推测；猜测；推断, both inside and outside Alphabet, *over* whether Mr Pichai is the right person for the job. Some Google executives and engineers *describe him as* “too *checked out*” （经检查）得到证实，获得证明; 察看，观察（有趣或有吸引力的人或事物） and his leadership *as* “uninspired” 无创意的；不激励人心的；乏味的. He *is also accused of* excessive(a.)过分的；过度的 risk aversion(n.)厌恶；憎恶. “I’*ve never shied away from* making big bets and following my instincts,” Mr Pichai *insists*. But *it is hard to argue 证明；表明 that* he *has shown* the vision of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.

- aversion : n. ~ (to sb/sth) a strong feeling of not liking sb/sth 厌恶；憎恶 +

- argue : [ VN ] ( formal ) to show clearly that sth exists or is true 证明；表明
.. These latest developments *argue* a change in government policy. 最近的事态发展表明政府改变了政策。

- 所有这些, 都激起了Alphabet内部和外部对皮查伊是否是该职位的合适人选的议论和猜测。一些谷歌高管和工程师, 形容他“太过时了”，他的领导能力“缺乏灵感”。他还被指控过度规避风险。皮查伊坚称:“在押注和跟随直觉方面，我从不退缩。”但很难说他展现了亚马逊(Amazon)的杰夫•贝佐斯(Jeff Bezos)或微软(Microsoft)的萨蒂亚•纳德拉(Satya Nadella)的远见。



Mr Pichai *has an opportunity to prove* the sceptics  怀疑论者 wrong. The covid-19 pandemic *offers a convenient pretext* 借口；托词 *to get rid of* inefficiencies 低效率,无能, such as overlapping （物体）部分重叠，交叠 products, and *cut through*  开辟（出路或通道） Alphabet’s internal `red tape` 繁文缛节；官僚作风.

1. PHRASE If you say that every cloud has a silver lining, you mean that every sad or unpleasant situation has a positive side to it. (黑暗中的)一线光明
.. As they say, *every cloud has a silver lining*. We have drawn lessons from the decisions taken.
正如他们所说，黑暗中总有一线光明。我们已从所作的决定中汲取了教训。
2. N-SING If you talk about a silver lining, you are talking about something positive that comes out of a sad or unpleasant situation. (不幸或不快中的)一线希望
.. The fall in inflation is *the silver lining* of the prolonged recession.
通货膨胀率下降, 是长期经济衰退中的一线希望。 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/s/silver lining.jpg[100,100]

- 皮查伊现在有机会证明怀疑者是错的。covid-19疫情给他提供了一个方便的借口，可以借此时机摆脱谷歌开发的产品有重叠等效率低下的问题，也可以改革Alphabet内部的繁文缛节。这可能会达成一种新的平衡, 在谷歌的创新文化, 和对其产品和服务的赚钱潜力的更系统性的开发利用上.
会在谷歌的创新文化, 和更系统地开发其产品和服务的赚钱潜力之间达成一种新的平衡。就连反垄断调查也给皮查伊带来了一线希望。他说:“在某些方面，我在寻求清晰的想法。”

( pl. -ies )
a person or company that is in a position of trust, especially when it involves controlling money or property belonging to others （尤指财产）受信托人（或公司）

- 然而，要想成为纳德拉(Satya Nadella, 微软ceo)那样类型的领导者，他必须更加大胆。一个想法是对其部分服务收费。另一个是让谷歌更多成为"数据受托人"，来管理人们的信息——有点像银行处理金钱那样。谷歌已经开始开发必要的工具，比如可以挖掘加密数据的软件。如果皮查伊能做到这一点，那将是真正鼓舞人心的。而且，这还能帮助Alphabet在一段时间内保持不陷于传统管理中。

== Alphabet grows up

Google’s problems are bigger than just the antitrust case

As the computing conglomerate has grown, so too have the risks that it becomes more like a conventional company

Jul 30th 2020 | MOUNTAIN VIEW


TO GET A good look at Google, climb a barren hill in front of the online giant’s Silicon Valley headquarters—or rather, both of them. To the right lies the old HQ, a clump of low-slung office buildings ringed by dozens of similar boxes. To the left a brand-new corporate centre is rising. From outside it resembles an oversized circus tent, but the inside is still undetermined: pillars, wooden panelling and hardly any walls. The bare-bones structure is meant to provide architectural flexibility. This will come in handy in a post-pandemic world in which offices will look quite different. “We’ll get a chance to reimagine it,” says Sundar Pichai, the boss of both Google and its parent company, Alphabet. And just as the bricks-and-mortar structure is changing, the organisation is in transition, too.

When Mr Pichai took over as chief executive of Google in August 2015, after it became the core of the newly formed Alphabet, the online-search-and-advertising business had annual revenues of $66bn and net income of $14bn. By the time Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google’s founders, handed him the reins of Google’s parent company last December his division was raking in profits of $34bn on sales of $161bn—and Alphabet was worth almost twice as much as four years earlier.

This enviable track record justifies Mr Pichai’s rich compensation package over several years, of $2m annual salary plus $240m in shares and stock options (depending on performance targets). It would also justify a degree of complacency. Far from it. Mr Pichai realises he inherited an organisation in the middle of momentous change. That is not just because of the founders’ departure or the move next year into the new HQ, but for a deeper reason. As Alphabet has grown—more than 4bn people are thought to use at least one of its products or services—so has the tug of economic and political forces on it.

From the outside, lawmakers and trustbusters are pressing it for explanations over alleged abuses of its market dominance in online-search-and-advertising technology. On July 29th Mr Pichai joined his opposite numbers at Amazon, Apple and Facebook to field angry questions from a congressional committee investigating Big Tech’s alleged anticompetitive practices (see article). On the inside, Google’s core businesses are maturing. After The Economist went to press Alphabet was expected to report the first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenues in its history, hurt by the pandemic-induced tightening of marketing budgets. And the company’s famously freewheeling culture is becoming harder to sustain.

Mr Pichai’s foremost challenge is to prevent Alphabet from becoming what Mr Brin and Mr Page were so bent on avoiding—a “conventional company” that dies a slow death from lack of innovation and declining growth. The task is as delicate as the technology giant is gargantuan.

Today Alphabet is a conglomerate of businesses that sometimes appear to have little in common—a corporate planetary system or Googleverse, if you will. Commercially, its centre of gravity is Google itself, and particularly its online-advertising business. This generates 83% of the group’s revenue and all its profits. It is a constellation unto itself, featuring a plethora of products that together form what is called the “online ad stack”: services to sell, buy and serve ads, and measure their effectiveness, all automatically. In all of these areas, Google is as globally dominant as it is in online search. Its market share in some parts of the ad-serving stack exceeds 90%.

On the surface this might suggest that Alphabet, like most big tech firms, is a “one-trick pony”, in the words of Michael Cusumano of MIT Sloan School of Management. In fact, it is a herd of ponies, some of which look rather more like full-grown Shires. Nine have more than a billion users globally (see chart 2). Every day people make an estimated 6bn search queries on Google and upload more than 49 years’ worth of video to YouTube. More than 300bn emails are said to be sent every day and if only one-third originate on Gmail—a conservative estimate—then a stack of print-outs would be 10,000km high.



And there is more. “Other bets”, as Alphabet’s financial statements refer to its non-core businesses, now number 11, each with its own capital structure. These include Access (offering fibre-optic broadband), GV (which invests in startups), Verily (a health-care firm), Waymo (a developer of autonomous cars) and X (a secretive skunk works engaged in all manner of moonshots). Commercially these ventures seem only loosely connected with the core. What links them to the main business is information processing—and specifically these days artificial intelligence (AI), which powers everything from search to Waymo’s self-driving cars.

Early on, the founders decided that to enable the company to grow with startup-like speed regardless of its actual size, they would create a singular organisational mix of institutions they knew best: the internet, the open-source-software movement and Stanford’s post-graduate programme, where the duo came up with Google’s original search algorithm in 1996.

Like the internet, Google was envisaged as an ever-expanding collection of groups of engineers linked by a common language and common goals, most prominently to “organise all the world’s information”. Alphabet, too, is a network of networks held together by technical standards. It grows horizontally by adding yet more networks.



To keep hierarchies flat, Mr Brin and Mr Page briefly went so far as to abolish managers altogether, though the experiment had to be dialled back. A compromise was to give managers a minimum of seven direct reports to limit the time they have to loom over each underling. They also had limited time to accost the two bosses, who at one point got rid of their personal assistants to make it harder to book time with them, forcing executives to ambush them whenever they appeared in public to get a sign-off on decisions.

Cosmic ambitions

Google resembled a big open-source project by being an open book, at least internally. Any employee could freely access all internal information except for sensitive user data or company finances. All code, project documents, even a colleague’s calendar, were fair game. Workers were encouraged to use one of Google’s plethora of messaging tools, such as mailing lists (of which there are now more than a million). They were also expected to ask tough questions at weekly company-wide town-hall meetings with the founders, called TGIF, for “Thank God It’s Friday” (now held on Thursdays to allow Googlers around the world to participate without having to get up on Saturday morning). Grievances were to be kept within the company’s walls. Leaking, particularly to the press, was a sackable offence. But the place was also meant to be playful; hence the playground-like offices, ping-pong tables and the like.

From Stanford Mr Brin and Mr Page borrowed the idea of letting people follow their passions. Google employees were allowed to spend 20% of their time working on what they thought would most benefit the firm, even if that often led to them working 120%. They also often set their own quarterly goals. Recruiting and promotion were similar to academia, too. Candidates were graded like PhD students and decisions about who should move up the corporate ladder were taken by a committee of peers from across the company, rather than individual managers, who often promote people they like rather than those who would do the best job.

Having created most of this unique structure in 2001 the founders recruited Eric Schmidt, a Silicon Valley veteran who understood both managers and technologists, to help implement it—or, as they themselves put it, to provide “adult supervision”. To shield the setup from potential shareholder pressure, the three of them built a legal moat around it. Google was one of the first Big Tech companies to opt for dual-class shares, which gave the original shareholders ten times the voting power. Although Messrs Page, Brin and Schmidt together held only a small stake, they retained an outsized 38% of voting rights. The founders warned in “An Owner’s Manual” for Google’s shareholders, published before the firm’s initial public offering in 2004, that new investors “will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting rights”.

Mr Page took over from Mr Schmidt as Google’s CEO in 2011 (though Mr Schmidt remained Alphabet’s executive chairman until 2018), before handing over to Mr Pichai four years later. Since then Mr Pichai has managed Google in much the same way that previously he ran Chrome, Google’s web browser, and other projects. Rather than getting bogged down in details, he put trusted people in charge, giving them resources and nudging them along.

The result is a collection of semi-independent firms with powerful bosses sitting atop each of them: Thomas Kurian at Google Cloud, Susan Wojcicki at YouTube, Rick Osterloh at Google’s hardware division and Hiroshi Lockheimer at the Android operation. In early June Mr Pichai put Prabhakar Raghavan, who already headed Google’s ad business, in charge of search as well, making him Google’s de facto deputy CEO. (Mustafa Suleyman, vice-president of AI policy at Google, sits on the board of The Economist’s parent company.) A company of Alphabet’s breadth would fail if it depended solely on one man’s judgment, Mr Pichai explains. “People have to be able to make their own decisions.”

These decisions are becoming harder. Googlers have always prided themselves on solving the toughest problems in computer science—less so on making money. This may be one reason why some of the company’s hit services generate smaller revenues than they might, like YouTube, or barely any at all, like Maps. Monetisation from the “other bets” has scarcely begun. They racked up more than $5bn in losses in the four quarters to March. Only Access and Verily bring in material revenues. Some could one day turn into huge businesses: Waymo was valued at about $30bn when it raised outside capital this spring. But even that impressive figure is much less than earlier estimates, which valued the autonomous-driving unit at more than $100bn.



None of this used to matter much, as long as Google’s ad products were “a gold-threaded safety net underneath every daring innovation”, as Steven Levy, one of Silicon Valley’s scribes, put it in 2011. It becomes a problem when it translates into lower margins and weaker stockmarket performance than rival tech giants (see chart 3 and chart 4).



Online advertising overall is far from a mature market, but growth in search ads, which continue to generate about 60% of Alphabet’s revenues, has slowed. In 2019 sales expanded by 15%, a healthy clip but considerably lower than the 22% a year earlier. General online search is also being “hollowed out” by specialised searches, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a research firm. Mr Shmulik estimates that about 60% of product searches now start on Amazon (whose fast-growing online-ad business is already the world’s third-biggest behind Google and Facebook).

Spaced out

Alphabet’s engineer-driven bottom-up culture is also showing signs of age. It can be hit and miss. “You can paper over a lot of problems by throwing money at it and hiring more bodies,” says a long-time Googler, who previously worked for Microsoft, which was regularly scooped by Google when it came to new products. “I thought they must have really clever strategists,” he recalls, only to discover on joining the firm that it “had hundreds of things happening in parallel”. Alphabet executives often liken their firm’s structure to a “slime mould”—organisms that survive as single cells, but must aggregate to reproduce.



Innovation can indeed mushroom in such a corporate ecosystem. But it may hinder the development of more structured products, which require more sustained co-operation and a strategic vision. This is particularly true of lucrative enterprise offerings, where corporate clients expect providers to be both consistent and responsive to their needs. Google has a reputation for being neither.

Over the years Google has churned out new messaging tools, from Allo and Buzz to Hangouts and Meet, only recently starting to develop a unified communications offering for corporations, similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams. Google’s cloud business has often been criticised for “not having a customer-service bone in its body”, says Brent Thill of Jefferies, a bank. As a result it lags behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure, where customer service verges on an obsession.

It is also becoming increasingly apparent that Alphabet’s organisational setup does not scale well. Even with a workforce of a few tens of thousands Google felt small, notes an employee who left a few years ago and later returned. With the firms’ 120,000 permanent workers complemented by an even more numerous (and less-well-paid) temporary or contract staff, the founders’ original idiosyncratic rules are becoming a drag. Executives grumble that internal promotion by committee is often a time-consuming political exercise. Letting a thousand flowers bloom is leading to an awful lot of compost.

Size creates political tensions, too. After 2016 the firm’s mostly woke workforce began using internal messaging tools to organise and press management to take action on everything from President Donald Trump’s harsh immigration policy to boycotting meat in its cafeterias. As Alphabet has hired engineers at breakneck speed, it is no longer “a country where everybody politically agrees” with the once-dominant liberal bent, says an insider.

Tensions came to a head in 2017 when James Damore, a Google software engineer, published a memo on an internal mailing list arguing that the lack of gender diversity in tech could partly be explained by biological differences. After it was leaked to the press he was fired, but many insiders felt that management, including Mr Pichai, had let the debate fester and did not do enough to help the activist employees who had been “doxxed” (having their personal details published online) by other staffers.

Things went downhill from there. Once unthinkable leaks multiplied. So did internal petitions. In 2018 activist employees forced Google not to renew an AI contract with the Pentagon and to abandon plans for a censored Chinese version of its search engine. Tensions culminated later that year when it emerged that high-performing executives accused of sexual harassment had been sent off with multi-million exit packages. More than 20,000 employees globally staged a walkout in protest.

“The walkout broke Larry’s heart,” says one Googler. It suggested that the goal of creating an engineers’ commune had failed. After that the two founders put more distance between themselves and their creation. They stopped attending the TGIF meetings. In many ways Mr Pichai’s ascent to the top job last year was a formality.

Although Mr Brin, Mr Page and Mr Schmidt remain Alphabet’s biggest individual shareholders—with 13.1% of shares and 56.7% of voting rights—a former senior executive says that the company is now run by a different triumvirate. Besides Mr Pichai it includes Kent Walker, senior vice-president of global affairs, and Ruth Porat, the finance chief poached from Morgan Stanley, an investment bank. Where Mr Brin and Mr Page were technologists and Mr Schmidt a technologist-manager, the new team are simply managers.

This transformation was apparent at Mr Pichai’s first quarterly earnings call as the boss of Alphabet in February, when he delighted analysts by at long last breaking out YouTube’s revenues ($15bn in 2019, up by more than a third from the previous year). He has also accelerated share buy-backs, from $6.1bn in the last quarter of 2019 to $8.5bn in the three months to March. “They are no longer the most hated big tech company from a shareholder perspective,” says Mr Thill of Jefferies.

Alphabet is also becoming shareholder-friendlier in how it manages its other bets. Some of the subsidiaries, like Waymo, have wooed outside investors, suggesting that they will one day be spun off. Others, such as Chronicle, which hoped to revolutionise cyber-security, and Jigsaw, a think-tank, have been folded back into Google. Yet others, like Makani, which is developing flying wind turbines to generate energy, are likely to be shut down or sold.

To infinity and beyond

Mr Pichai’s shakeup of management is on starkest display at Google Cloud. After he became Google’s boss five years ago it was becoming apparent that cloud-computing was something more than a passing fad. He ramped up investment in the division and in 2018 hired Mr Kurian, a former senior executive at Oracle, a big maker of corporate software, to run it. In keeping with Mr Pichai’s evolving management philosophy, Mr Kurian was granted far more autonomy than his predecessor, Diane Greene, and turned the unit into a more top-down organisation, hiring people from his former employer as well as SAP, its German rival.

It seems to be working. Google’s cloud business, which includes G Suite, its package of professional online services, is growing at more than 50% a year. Revenues are expected to reach $13bn this year, contributing 8% to Alphabet’s total.

However, Mr Kurian’s financial success carries a risk. Insiders report a mini-exodus from the cloud unit to other parts of Alphabet. Plenty of employees worry that the top-down-approach from Google’s cloud business will spread throughout the organisation. Many are beginning to grumble about getting tasks handed down from above with a deadline.

That hints at a bigger unsolved problem with Google’s culture. After the walkouts, management made some tweaks. “When we were smaller, we all worked as one team, on one product, and everyone understood how business decisions were made. It’s harder to give a company of over 100,000 people the full context on everything,” Mr Walker reportedly wrote in November in an internal newsletter. The TGIF meetings are now held only once a month and limited to business-related questions. The largest internal mailing lists are moderated and postings deemed too political are allegedly being taken down. These days employees are being told to access sensitive documents only if they “need to know”. Some staff talk of creating if not a labour union, then at least a group to defend their interests.

In the wake of the killing of George Floyd many Googlers criticised their top management for doing too little, too late to make the company more diverse; after a couple of weeks the firm vowed to raise the “leadership representation of underrepresented groups” by 30% over the next five years. In June more than 2,000 employees signed an open letter to Mr Pichai demanding that the company stop selling its technology to police forces across America.



Over the past few weeks things have seemed to calm down internally. But the respite may be superficial. Many workers are keeping their mouths shut for fear of being laid off, one Googler reports. Few relish the thought of losing a cushy job in a recession. Activists now shun the firm’s communication tools and organise elsewhere online.

All this fuels murmurings and speculation, both inside and outside Alphabet, over whether Mr Pichai is the right person for the job. Some Google executives and engineers describe him as “too checked out” and his leadership as “uninspired”. He is also accused of excessive risk aversion. “I’ve never shied away from making big bets and following my instincts,” Mr Pichai insists. But it is hard to argue that he has shown the vision of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.

Mr Pichai has an opportunity to prove the sceptics wrong. The covid-19 pandemic offers a convenient pretext to get rid of inefficiencies, such as overlapping products, and cut through Alphabet’s internal red tape. It could result in a new balance being struck between Google’s innovative culture and more systematic exploitation of its products’ and services’ money-making potential. Even the antitrust probes have a silver lining for Mr Pichai. “In some ways, I’m looking for clarity,” he says.

To be a leader in the mould of Mr Nadella, however, he would have to be more daring. One idea is to charge for some of its services. Another is for Google to become more of a data fiduciary that manages people’s information for them—a bit like a bank does with money. The firm has already started developing tools necessary for this, such as software that can mine encrypted data. If Mr Pichai could pull this off, that would be truly inspirational. And it would help keep Alphabet unconventional for a while yet.





皮查伊现在有机会证明怀疑者是错的。covid-19疫情给他提供了一个方便的借口，可以借此时机摆脱谷歌开发的产品有重叠等效率低下的问题，也可以改革Alphabet内部的繁文缛节。这可能会达成一种新的平衡, 在谷歌的创新文化, 和对其产品和服务的赚钱潜力的更系统性的开发利用上.
会在谷歌的创新文化, 和更系统地开发其产品和服务的赚钱潜力之间达成一种新的平衡。就连反垄断调查也给皮查伊带来了一线希望。他说:“在某些方面，我在寻求清晰。”
然而，要想成为纳德拉(Satya Nadella, 微软ceo)那样类型的领导者，他必须更加大胆。一个想法是对其部分服务收费。另一个是让谷歌更多成为"数据受托人"，来管理人们的信息——有点像银行处理金钱那样。谷歌已经开始开发必要的工具，比如可以挖掘加密数据的软件。如果皮查伊能做到这一点，那将是真正鼓舞人心的。而且，这还能帮助Alphabet在一段时间内保持不陷于传统管理中。
