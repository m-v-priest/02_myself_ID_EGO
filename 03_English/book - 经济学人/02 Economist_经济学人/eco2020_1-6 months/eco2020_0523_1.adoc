How the world’s premier(a.) public-health agency was handcuffed 

The CDC has been absent with leave during the spread of covid-19

May 23rd 2020 |


IN 2014 TOM FRIEDEN, the head of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), appeared almost daily to brief(v.) the public about the Ebola virus, the last pandemic to hit the United States before the coronavirus. His agency formulated policy for dealing with Ebola, and also embodied it. The CDC trained 6,500 people in America and 25,000 in West Africa to look after victims. `主` The vaccine that finally treated the disease `谓` was tested in a CDC laboratory. The end of the outbreak confirmed the agency as the world’s leading public-health body.

Contrast(v.) that with what has happened during the coronavirus outbreak. On May 17th a senior White House official, the director of trade policy, said the CDC “really let the country down”. The administration gutted CDC guidelines telling restaurants, child-care centres and others how to reopen, reducing them from more than 50 pages to six. The CDC has been muzzled, says Jeremy Konyndyk of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank. It has held no public briefings since mid-March. Meanwhile, `主` the first testing kits that the World Health Organisation is distributing `谓` came from Germany.

What used to be America’s most prestigious(a.) public-health body has been relegated to one voice among many in the clamour of the White House. The result is to squander(v.) expertise, compound confusion about who, if anyone, is in charge of the federal response to the virus and make the reopening of the country riskier than it need be.

America is slowly passing its peak of infection. As it does so, Donald Trump is signalling that governors should take the lead in reopening states. In public-health terms, however, states play(v.) only a secondary role; state and city public-health departments mostly do routine things such as providing vaccines for children and hygiene certificates(n.) for restaurants. Combating an emergency, by running laboratories or conducting epidemiological research, is financed by the federal government; 55% of state and local public-health spending comes from federal sources. In public health, therefore, the CDC is by far the most important agency and state health departments depend upon it. Some are seeing sharp falls(n.) in the number of people testing positive for the virus, including New York and New Jersey. They may be in relatively good shape. But in parts of the South and Midwest, the number of new cases or hospitalisations is rising. Here, the diminishing of the CDC may imperil(v.) recovery.

How was the agency brought so low? On February 5th, the CDC sent to state laboratories a testing kit for covid-19 that it had been working on at headquarters. Something was wrong with one of the reagents /and state labs could not get the test to work. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates medical devices, including tests, then dithered for three weeks before allowing private and university laboratories to work on the problem, which they soon fixed. But when tests did become available, the CDC restricted them to a handful of Americans. By the time the rules were relaxed, the CDC had missed the vital first stages of the epidemic; community transmission was rife(a.).

The agency was at fault. But so were others: the FDA and the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, who has political responsibility. President Trump, who is taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug not approved against the coronavirus, hardly needs an excuse to ignore medical science. But whoever was at fault, the episode widened a gap of distrust between the CDC and the White House.

According to the Washington Post, Deborah Birx, co-ordinator of the White House’s coronavirus task-force, says “There is nothing from the CDC I can trust.” The administration has set up a parallel data-gathering operation, asking a private company to provide statistics on hospital capacity, covid-19 deaths and so on, which the CDC already has. Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard Chan School of Public Health talks of “the handcuffing of a great institution”.

There is a second explanation for the CDC’s marginalisation: money. Though the agency’s own budget has been protected, a wider squeeze on public-health funding has undermined its ability to help states.

Public health is chronically under-funded. In 2018 America spent less than $300 per person on it, compared with over $10,000 on all health care, according to the Trust for America’s Health (TFAH), a not-for-profit group. In the decade to 2017, jobs in public health fell by 50,000.

Mr Trump has proposed cutting(v.) the CDC’s budget each year by between 10% and 20%, but Congress has protected the agency. The CDC’s budget has been flat since 2016, and this year emergency-spending bills will provide an extra $6bn over the next five years. However, the two main programmes for helping state and local health-care systems prepare for emergencies, Public Health Emergency Preparedness and the Hospital Preparedness Programme, have been cut by over 50% in real terms since 2003. This has forced states to scale back emergency preparation /and left the CDC bearing more of that burden.

It is struggling. Though the agency continues to churn out advice -- its website has had 1.2bn clicks since the start of the epidemic -- John Auerbach of TFAH, who has worked in state and city health departments for decades, says departments can no longer get the help they need from the CDC. Instead, they are turning to less-reliable and often-conflicting advice, producing a muddle of different rules.

The combination of financial pressure and White House indifference(n.) has scuppered any chance (America had) to produce a national strategy for covid-19. In the past the CDC would have been central to that effort. Now, it is competing with a White House task-force and a group headed by the president’s son-in-law for Mr Trump’s fitful attention. The institution with the largest concentration of scientific expertise has been sidelined(v.), and state health departments are getting flawed advice.

America’s latest salvo(n.) against Huawei is aimed at chipmaking in China

It may push the industry out of America, too

May 21st 2020 | HONG KONG


AMERICA HAS it in for Huawei -- and not just because some of its politicians fear the Chinese giant’s networking gear lets spooks in Beijing eavesdrop(v.) on customers’ communications. The firm, a world leader in futuristic(a.) 5G telecoms, also symbolises(v.) China’s technological and economic ascent. President Donald Trump does not like it [one bit]. William Barr, his attorney-general, has warned that America risks(v.) “surrendering dominance” to China if it cannot “blunt(v.) Huawei’s drive” to 5G supremacy.

`主` An earlier attempt at blunting, which made it illegal to sell American-made components to Huawei, including advanced computer chips on which the Chinese firm relies, `系` was not the knock-out blow the White House hoped it to be. Chipmakers were able keep shipping Huawei semiconductors from factories outside America. So on May 15th the Trump administration extended its restrictions from chips to the tools used to make them -- many of which come from America. So long as big microprocessor producers, like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), use American-made equipment, they will no longer be able to forge Huawei-designed chips anywhere in the world.

In a press conference on May 18th a reticent(a.) Huawei said that the new rule put its survival at risk. Three days later President Xi Jinping vowed to invest $1.4trn by 2025 to increase China’s tech independence. Yet as with America’s original restrictions, the latest blast in the Sino-American chip war may not end up having the intended effect.

Playing dirty in the clean room

The new rule may miss its target entirely. Huawei pays contract manufacturers to assemble its phones and base stations. `主` The chips that TSMC makes for Huawei `谓` are sent to those companies, not to the Chinese firm, for integration. Finished products are usually sent directly to Huawei’s customers. Huawei need not touch the blacklisted chips [at any point]. This may get Huawei off the hook. Some lawyers note that the new restriction does not seem to apply to items sent to third parties and not destined(a.) for Huawei, even where these are being supplied [at Huawei’s direction].

Even if the legal experts are wrong, the rule will be difficult to enforce: the clean rooms of Asian chip foundries are hard to monitor. More important, the $412bn semiconductor industry is so globalised that even the long arm of American law will struggle to pin it down. The likelier upshot of the new export controls may be to drive(v.) a portion of America’s chipmaking industry from its shores.

The industry’s geographic scope was already becoming broader -- and less American -- over time. One crude yardstick for this is to track(v.) where its physical assets sit, as recorded in the filings of public tech businesses (see chart). The top dozen global semiconductor firms, for example, now have only 20% of their plant in America. Asian firms, such as TSMC, SMIC and Samsung, mostly locate their factories at home. American chipmakers, meanwhile, and many suppliers, have been diversifying geographically for years, says Dan Hutcheson of VLSI, a consultancy -- partly in pursuit of cheap labour, partly to protect against natural disasters.



Consider Intel, which makes chips of its own design for customers (among them Huawei) that assemble electronic devices. In 2019 the American giant had 宾over 35% of its $55bn in physical assets, a rough proxy for manufacturing capacity, 宾补 abroad. Some $8bn-worth sat in Israel and another $4bn in Ireland. Industry insiders report that China-bound shipments from both places have increased since America’s Huawei-baiting began. Intel also has more than $5bn in assets in China, its biggest market. All told, $20bn of its $72bn in revenues last year came from China.

Another example is Analog Devices, a smaller American firm which makes radio-frequency chips on which Huawei relies heavily for the assembly of telecoms base stations. It, too, is spread around: half of its assets sit in the Philippines, Ireland, Singapore and Malaysia. Perhaps that might make it easier for the firm to explore the option of making its Huawei-bound chips in non-American facilities.

Geographic complexity has made it hard for America’s government to stop chipmakers’ kit from reaching(v.) Huawei. Hence the new focus on chipmaking tools, many of which are still made in America and so easier for Washington to control. `主` Applied Materials, based in California, builds kit used to etch(v.) patterns into silicon, `谓` has 90% of its assets in the United States. `主` Lam Research, an American maker equipment used by TSMC and others to process silicon wafers, `谓` has 88% of its $1.1bn plant at home.

`主` One big unknown surrounding the new Huawei rule -- which the chip industry’s lawyers are busily unpacking -- `系` is `主` whether, under it, equipment (manufactured(v.) at American firms’ overseas facilities) `谓` counts as “American”. If so, `主` advanced chipmaking factories that rely on such kit to fabricate cutting-edge chips for Huawei, as TSMC does, `谓` will need alternative suppliers. The American toolmakers’ Japanese rivals, such as Tokyo Electron and Hitachi High-Technologies, suddenly find themselves with a new geopolitical competitive edge.

Another mystery relates to an announcement (made just as `主` the new American measures against Huawei `谓` were being unveiled). On May 15th TSMC confirmed it would build a $12bn chip factory in Arizona, to be up and running by 2024. Why would the Taiwanese firm, which gets 15% of its revenue from Huawei, agree to pour(v.) billions into America just as its new host(n.) [in effect] deprived it of a big customer? It may be currying(v.) favour with the administration, hoping to avert(v.) sanctions against more Chinese customers. Observers point to another possibility. TSMC could equip the Arizona foundry with American gear from its existing factories, freeing space in its Taiwanese operations for brand(v.) new non-American kit that can freely serve Chinese customers. TMSC did not respond to a request for comment.

Even if that is not TSMC’s intention, workarounds are bound to proliferate(v.). On May 18th the boss of Samsung Electronics toured his company’s new chip factory in Xian, a city in central China. The South Korean firm, which plans to invest $115bn in its chipmaking business over the next decade, has made it clear that it will not ignore China. America’s export controls may prompt it to kit out its foundries with equipment that will not fall foul of Sino-American geopolitics.

Chip-industry insiders report that semiconductor equipment is already being marketed inside China as “EAR free” -- meaning Chinese buyers need not worry about the “export administration regulations” that the Trump administration is using to attack Huawei. A person close to American toolmakers says some of them are thinking about moving(v.) their patents abroad to rebuild operations from scratch away from America’s jurisdiction, in order to circumvent present and future anti-Chinese restrictions. Mr Trump’s attempt to de-Sinify(v.) the semiconductor industry may do more to de-Americanise it [instead].
