WEIJI VILLAGE *is* a bleak(`=(of a place 地方) exposed, empty, or with no pleasant features 无遮掩的；荒凉的；索然无味的`) spot in winter, even without the disease-control roadblock 路障 just up(`=along or further along a road or street 沿着；顺着`) the road *complete*(a.)(`=*~ with sth* [ not before noun ] including sth as an extra part or feature 包括，含有（额外部分或特征）`) *with* medical staff in blue protective suits 防护服, *using* pistol 手枪-shaped electronic thermometers 温度计；体温计 *to check* the foreheads of drivers and passengers *for* signs of fever.

China *is full of* rural scenes like this one, in a forgotten corner of Henan province. +

如果没有沿着路边的防控疾病的路障, 和 穿着蓝色防护服的医务人员，用手枪形状的电子温度计检查司机和乘客的额头, 以检查他们是否有发烧的迹象, 魏集村在冬天就是个荒凉的地方. +
从灰色的天空, 到单调的种着冬麦的绿野, 还有很深的棕色泥坑, 以至于连普通的汽车都无法通行, 这些景象, 构成了这个村子的主色调. +
这个地处湖南遗忘角落的村庄景象, 在中国到处存在着. +
与其他地方唯一的不同只是, 魏集乡是个离湖北省边境很近的村庄. 湖北是一个内陆省份，人口近6000万(大致相当于意大利的人口)，为了减缓一种危险的新型冠状病毒的传播，它几乎与外部世界隔绝了。

Chinese cities *brim*(`= *~ (with sth)* : to be full of sth; to fill sth （使）满，盛满`) *with* migrant （为工作）移居者；移民 workers(n.) from villages like Weiji, ① *hauling* （用力）拖，拉，拽 bricks [*on* building sites(`=*building site* : 建筑工地`)] or ② *delivering* fast food [on electric mopeds(`=a motorcycle with a small engine and also pedals 机器脚踏车；摩托自行车`)].

中国的城市里充斥着来自魏集这样的村庄的农民工，他们在建筑工地上搬砖，或者用电动轻便摩托车运送快餐。在中国过去40年的快速发展中，这些人将财富转回农村。他们通过点击智能手机应用程序, 将钱汇回家乡 -- 因为中国在移动支付方面远远领先于西方 -- 然后亲自回老家过农历新年，并满载着从城市购买的衣服和精美食品等礼物。然而，他们今年不能够了。

About 200 migrants from Weiji *work*(v.) in Hubei’s capital, Wuhan, the city (where the virus *was discovered* (pictured, under lockdown)).

[Because some *returned to* the village for the new year, which *began* on January 25th], Weiji *was dragged into* a vast quarantine 隔离 operation that *has trapped*(`=to force sb/sth into a place or situation that they cannot escape from, especially in order to catch them 把…逼进，迫使…进入（不能逃脱的地方）`) tens of millions of Chinese *in* their homes, *grounded*(`=ground : to prevent an aircraft from taking off 使停飞；阻止…起飞`) some international flights, *halted* long-distance bus services and *closed* the country’s largest tourist sites 旅游景点.

The virus-control campaign *explains* a splash(`= a small area of bright colour or light that contrasts with the colours around it 色块；光斑`) of colour on Weiji’s almost-empty main street, a red banner *urging*(`=urge : 敦促；催促；力劝`) locals 当地居民 *to be tested* 医疗上的）检查，化验，检验. It *reads*: “*Find* It Early! *Treat* 医治；治疗 It Early! Medical Fees All Free!”


大约200名魏集人,在湖北的省会武汉工作，武汉是发现新型冠状病毒的城市(见图中，该城市已处于封锁状态)。 +
由于一些人开始返乡过年，中国今年的新年假期,从1月25日(大年初一)开始, 这导致魏集乡, 被迫开始进行大规模的隔离行动，该隔离行动, 将中国的千万人口, 限制在家中; 使一些国际航班停飞，长途巴士服务中断，国内最大的旅游景点也被关闭。 +
这场控制病毒的活动, 解释了魏集乡几乎空空大街上的一抹颜色, 一条红色的横幅敦促当地人接受检查, 上面写着："早发现！早治疗！医疗费全免！"。

`主` That encouraging(a.)鼓舞人心的, cajoling(`=cajole : *~ sb (into sth/into doing sth) /~ sth out of sb* : to make sb do sth by talking to them and being very nice to them 劝诱；哄骗；诱骗`) sign 招牌；标牌；指示牌；标志 `谓` *is buttressed*(`=buttress : to support or give strength to sb/sth 支持；给…以力量;/a stone or brick structure that supports a wall 扶壁；支墩`) *by* a dose(`=an amount of sth 一份；一次；一点`) of coercion 强迫；胁迫.

这种鼓舞人心的、诱人的标牌标语, 背后有强制力的支撑。村里党委书, 有着一张年轻的脸庞, 他穿着一件漂亮的黑色风衣，描述了上级的指示。湖北牌照的汽车将被拒之门外，从湖北省来的务工人员, 将被遣返回去。那些在1月20日实施管制之前回到魏集的人, 必须每天接受两次体温检测，并留在家里，不允许有客来访。外国的专家们, 可能会就这种大规模隔离是否具有医疗功效, 展开辩论，但当地人的描述, 却带有一种舒适感, 因为国家已经在做一些行动, 来抗击习主席所称的“魔鬼”病毒。

`主` A farmer and grandfather of two `谓` *points(v.) to* （用手指头或物体）指，指向 government notices(n.) *fluttering*(v.)(`=to move lightly and quickly; to make sth move in this way （使）飘动，挥动，颤动`) on shuttered 活动护窗；百叶窗 shop fronts(`=*shop front* : A shop front is the outside part of a shop which faces the street, including the door and windows. 店面`).

When the government *tells* the Chinese people *to make sacrifices for* the country, they *listen*, he *booms*(`=*~ (out)* : to say sth in a loud deep voice 以低沉有力的声音说`). “It’s different from your Western countries.”


一位农民同时也是两个孩子的祖父, 他指着贴在店面的百叶窗上的政府通知, 说: 官员们说，呆在家里是“老百姓能做出的最大贡献”。另一名当地人, 也自告奋勇地向他村子里的外国记者, 发表了爱国评论。当政府告诉中国人民要为国家做出牺牲时，他们听从了. 他低沉有力地说道: “这与你们西方国家不同。”

Many villages *have shut themselves off from*(`=*shut sb/sth off from sth* : to separate sb/sth from sth 使与…隔离（或隔绝）`) outsiders *using* ① barricades(`=barricade : a line of objects placed across a road, etc. to stop people from getting past 路障；街垒`) *made of* freshly-dug earth 泥土, ② lumps （通常为无定形的）块 of concrete ③ or, in one case, a parked 停泊的 tractor 拖拉机 (an example outside the village of Wangyoufang, southern Henan, is pictured).

The campaign *is* an odd mix of high and low technology.

====

-> They had achieved a lot *in a short space of time* . 他们在短时间内取得了很大的成绩。

- *hint (of sth)* : a small amount of sth 少许；少量 +
-> *a hint of a smile* 一丝笑意
====


许多村庄用新挖的泥土、混凝土块, 或拖拉机(如图所示，河南南部Wangyoufang村外)设置路障，将自己与外界隔绝。在其中一个路障前，戴着一次性口罩的老人, 坐在一张木制办公桌前，面前放着一罐温度计。这个运动是一场高科技和低科技的奇怪结合。河南警方在审问这名记者时，通过将他的中国电话号码输入移动设备，找到了他的照片和详细信息。但是电子体温计在几秒钟内就给出了不同的读数——这种缺陷令人担忧，因为在检查站即使只表现出一点点发烧的迹象，就可能导致14天的隔离。

Mao *had it easy*

The virus’s spread *is straining*(`=to injure yourself or part of your body by making it work too hard 损伤；拉伤；扭伤;/to try to make sth do more than it is able to do 过度使用；使不堪承受`) a public health system that *lags*(`=*~ (behind sb/sth) /~ (behind)* : to move or develop slowly or more slowly than other people, organizations, etc. 缓慢移动；发展缓慢；滞后；落后于`) other Chinese infrastructure (under-staffed(a.)人员不足的, ill-equipped(`=*~ (for sth) /~ (to do sth)* : not having the necessary equipment or skills 装备不完善的；技术不够的`) hospitals *sit next to* gleaming(a.)(`=shining brightly 闪耀的；明亮的`) high-speed railway stations).

这场病毒, 对于专门设计用于中国的威权一党政治制度来说, 是一次巨大的考验. 在中国, 大多数工人为国家或农村集体工作，很少四处走动，依靠国家和党的新闻媒体了解正在发生的事情。

“I *can only trust* the punctuation 标点符号 marks(n.)(`=*punctuation mark 标点符号*`) in Hubei Daily,” *grumbled*(`=grumble : *~ (at/to sb) (about/at sb/sth)* : to complain about sb/sth in a bad-tempered way 咕哝；嘟囔；发牢骚`) a commentator （电台、电视台或报刊的）评论员 on Weibo.

今天，子弹头列车在全国各地纵横交错。富裕的都市人利用农历新年去国外度假。就连魏集的村民也承认，他们在微博或微信等社交媒体平台上读到了对政府危机应对措施的批评，尽管审查人员仍在争先恐后地删除任何斥责习主席和其他国家领导人的帖子。 +
谴责下级当局的帖子被允许的频率比往常更高。当党报“湖北日报”警告读者不要散布谣言时，引发了嘲讽的反弹。 +
一位评论员在微博上抱怨道：“我只能相信湖北日报上的标点符号。”警方已经惩罚了真正的谣言传播者，比如一名男子在中国东南部被拘留三天，因为他给朋友发了(虚假的)短信，说有一个受感染的陌生人在他的村庄里漫步。 +
相比之下，武汉警方在1月1日宣布并被官方媒体重点报道的一起案件中，8名被武汉警方处罚的“造谣者”实际上是医生，他们分享了微信医学小组中一种奇怪的新病毒的早期消息。 +
在一次罕见的干预中，最高人民法院于1月28日在网上发布了一篇文章，哀叹那些医生的被沉默。

How come 为什么;怎么会…(那样) the authorities *cannot find* passengers in a split second 一刹那,一瞬间,顷刻,片刻, *asked* a Weibo user, *adding*: “Aren’t we all 2020-big-data-high-tech now?”

====
- 大家都知道“a second”的意思是“一秒钟”，*当我们形容“一瞬间，一刹那”，或是“非常短暂的一段时间”时，我们则可以使用表达“a split second 劈开了的一秒钟”。* +
根据语境，*“a split second”可以与介词“in”或者“for”搭配。* +
另外，我们常会听人们说 *“make a split-second decision”，意思是“做出迅速的决定”*，需要注意的是这里的“split”和“second”之间需要用连字符“－”使之成为复合形容词。

中国网民接受的教育是, 他们生活在一个全知的受监控的国家，当病毒运动暴露出当局的盲点时，他们的反应很惊讶。大型官方报纸的网站公布了一份名单, 上面列有100多名被感染者所乘坐的航班和火车，并敦促同行的乘客, 去做体检。一个微博网友问道，为什么当局无法立即找到这些乘客呢? 并补充道：“我们现在不已经是2020年的高科技大数据时代了吗？”

China’s response(n.) to the virus *has been unmistakably(`=that cannot be mistaken for sb/sth else 不会弄错地；确定无疑地；清楚明白地`) authoritarian(a.)威权主义的；专制的, *involving* ① the locking down(`=lockdown : a security measure in which those inside a building such as a prison, school, or hospital are required to remain confined in it for a time 防范禁闭(期)`) of Hubei’s cities, and ② mandatory(a.)(`=*~ (for sb) (to do sth)* ( formal ) required by law 强制的；法定的；义务的`) orders(n.) *to stay indoors* [for a fortnight] for those who *leave Hubei* and *head to* such centres as Shanghai.

Unlike in the Mao era, when blind loyalty *was demanded* 强烈要求 from citizens, the party *has [at times] responded to* public anger *with* a hint of understanding.

In a much-discussed 大量讨论的;非常热门的 state television interview, Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, *offered* 主动提出；自愿给予 *to resign* 辞职 if the public *wished*.

对这个病毒, 中国政府作出的回应, 无疑是威权的，包括封锁湖北各城市，并强制命令那些离开湖北前往上海等中心的人, 先在室内隔离两周。但这并不是极权主义。与毛时代不同，在毛时代，会要求公民盲目忠诚，但如今,党有时会以一种带有理解的暗示举动, 来回应公众的愤怒。在一个被引发热议的国家电视台采访中，武汉市市长周先旺说，如果公众想要的话，他愿意辞职。尽管如此，他的道歉包含了对他北京主人的毫不掩饰的抨击。周承认该市隐瞒了有关疫情的信息，但指出，他需要上级的授权许可, 才能披露传染病的消息。

The principle of quarantine （为防传染的）隔离期；检疫 *is rarely challenged*, even in Wuhan.

Residents (*reached*(`=to communicate with sb, especially by telephone （尤指用电话）联系，与…取得联系`) *by* telephone) *describe* a mix of community spirit 团体精神;社区精神, such as ① bakeries(`=bakery : a place where bread and cakes are made and/or sold 面包（糕饼）店；面包（糕饼）烘房；面包厂`) *offering* free food *to* medics(n.)(`=medic : a medical student or doctor 医科学生；医生；大夫`), ② a mass 大批的；数量极多的；广泛的 singing of the national anthem 国歌；（组织或群体的）社歌，团歌;（宗教）赞美歌 out of apartment windows *as well as*(`=*as well (as sb/sth)* : in addition to sb/sth; too 除…之外；也；还`) some grumbling 咕哝；嘟囔；发牢骚 about confusing and draconian(a.)(`= (of a law, punishment, etc. 法律、惩罚等) extremely cruel and severe 德拉古式的；严酷的；残忍的`) local decisions.

[In a city of 9m people (the mayor *says* another 5m *left*, just before the quarantine *was imposed*, because of the holiday and the virus)] taxis *are now* the only public transport(`=a vehicle or method of travel 交通车辆；运输工具；旅行方式`).

They *can no longer be hailed*(`=hail : 招手（请出租车或公共汽车停下）;/跟…打招呼；向…喊`) on the streets, however, or *summoned*(`=summon : to order sb to come to you 召唤`) through an app.

They *have been commandeered*(`=commandeer : to take control of a building, a vehicle, etc. for military purposes during a war, or by force for your own use （战争期间为军事目的而）强征，征用；强占`) by the city.

- commandeer => com- 加强意义 + -mand- 命令 + -eer 动词词尾. 来自command, 命令。后用于军事术语。

Duties(`=duty : duties [pl.] : tasks that are part of your job 职责；任务`) *include* “emergency 突发事件；紧急情况 runs” such as *ferrying* the sick *to* hospitals, *says* Wang Jie, a retired taxi driver.

Rides 搭乘；乘坐 *are* free. The city *pays* drivers 600 yuan ($86) a day, more than double what they *make* in normal times. Still, many *fear*(v.) being infected, *says* Ms Wang. Most *have to buy* their own protective masks, goggles(`= a pair of glasses that fit closely to the face to protect the eyes from wind, dust, water, etc. 护目镜；风镜；游泳镜`) and gloves （分手指的）手套.

隔离检疫的原则, 很少受到挑战，即使在武汉也是如此。本经济学人通过电话联系到了一个居民, 他描述了一种混合着社区精神和市民抱怨的情形: 比如, 面包店会向医务人员提供免费的食物，也有人在公寓窗户外集体唱国歌. 但也有抱怨的声音, 直指混乱和严厉的地方性决定。在这座拥有900万人口的城市(市长说，由于节日和病毒的原因，就在隔离措施实施之前，已有500万人离开)，出租车现在是唯一的公共交通工具。然而，人们不能在街上打的, 也不能通过app来召唤他们, 他们已经被城市征用了。退休出租车司机王杰(音译)说，他们的职责包括“在紧急情况下的出行”，比如把病人送到医院。乘坐这些车是免费的, 该市向司机支付的工资为每天600元(86美元)，是他们平时收入的两倍多。王女士说，尽管如此，许多人还是害怕被感染。大多数人不得不自己买防护口罩、护目镜和手套。


*Ignore* the welcome sign

忽略欢迎标志。

== 16. Tough quarantine measures have spread across China 纯净版

In Hubei province, a population (the size of Italy’s) *is* under lockdown(n.)

Jan 30th 2020 | WEIJI VILLAGE, HENAN


WEIJI VILLAGE *is* a bleak spot [in winter], even without the disease-control roadblock *[just] up* the road *complete with* medical staff (in blue protective suits), *using* pistol-shaped electronic thermometers *to check* the foreheads of drivers and passengers *for* signs of fever. The village’s colour palette(n.) *ranges from* the grey of the sky *to* flat green fields of winter wheat /and the brown of mud-filled potholes *so* deep *that* ordinary cars cannot pass. China *is full of* rural scenes like this one, in a forgotten corner of Henan province. Weiji’s only distinction *is that* it *is* a border village, a short walk from Hubei, an inland province of nearly 60m people (roughly the population of Italy) that *has been [all but] sealed off from* the outside world *to slow* the spread of a dangerous new coronavirus.

Chinese cities *brim(v.) with* migrant workers from villages like Weiji, *hauling* bricks [on building sites] or *delivering* fast food [on electric mopeds]. During China’s rapid growth of the past 40 years, such people *have helped* spread(v.) wealth to the countryside. They *send* money *back to* home villages *with taps [on* a smartphone app] -- for China *is way ahead of* the West when it *comes to* mobile payments -- and *return [in person]* for the lunar new year, *laden with* gifts of city-bought clothes and fancy foods. Not this year, however.

About 200 migrants from Weiji *work*(v.) in Hubei’s capital, Wuhan, the city where the virus *was discovered* (pictured, under lockdown). [Because some *returned to* the village for the new year, which *began* on January 25th], Weiji *was dragged into* a vast quarantine operation that *has trapped* tens of millions of Chinese *in* their homes, *grounded*(v.) some international flights, *halted* long-distance bus services and *closed* the country’s largest tourist sites. The virus-control campaign *explains* a splash of colour on Weiji’s almost-empty main street, a red banner *urging* locals *to be tested*. It *reads*: “*Find* It Early! *Treat* It Early! Medical Fees All Free!”


That encouraging, cajoling sign *is buttressed by* a dose of coercion. The village’s fresh-faced Communist Party chief, who *wears* a smart black windbreaker, *describes* instructions from higher-ups. Cars with Hubei number plates *are* to be turned away, and migrants returning from that province *sent back*. `主` Those who *made it home to Weiji* before controls *were imposed* on January 20th `谓` *must submit to* temperature checks twice a day and *remain indoors* in their family homes, with no visitors *allowed*. Foreign experts *may debate* the medical efficacy of mass quarantines, but locals *describe* a sense of comfort from *doing* something *to fight* what President Xi Jinping calls a “devil” virus.

A farmer and grandfather of two *points(v.) to* government notices (*fluttering* on shuttered shop fronts). Officials *have said that* staying at home *is* “the biggest contribution one can make”, he *explains*. Unbidden, another local *offers* a patriotic commentary *to* the foreign reporter in his village. When the government *tells* the Chinese people *to make sacrifices for* the country, they *listen*, he *booms*. “It’s different from your Western countries.”

Many villages *have shut themselves off* from outsiders *using* barricades(n.) (*made of* freshly-dug earth, lumps of concrete or, in one case, a parked tractor (an example *outside* the village of Wangyoufang, southern Henan, is pictured)). At one such roadblock, old men (in disposable face-masks) *sit at* a wooden office desk, a pot of thermometers in front of them. The campaign *is* an odd mix of high and low technology. Henan police (*questioning* this reporter) *were able to summon up* his photograph and details *by tapping* his Chinese telephone number *into* a mobile device. But electronic thermometers *gave* very different readings(n.) [in the space of a few seconds] -- an alarming flaw when even a hint of fever at a checkpoint *can result in* 14 days of quarantine.

Mao *had it easy*

The virus’s spread(n.) *is straining* a public health system that *lags* other Chinese infrastructure (under-staffed, ill-equipped hospitals *sit next to* gleaming high-speed railway stations). It *is* also a giant test *for* an authoritarian, one-party political system *designed* in a simpler China, when most workers *toiled for* the state or rural collectives, *rarely moved around* /and *relied on* state and party news outlets *to learn* what was going on.

[Today] bullet trains *criss-cross* the country. Affluent urbanites *use* lunar new year *to take* foreign holidays. Even villagers in Weiji *admit to* reading(v.) criticisms of the government’s crisis response(n.) [on *such* social-media platforms *as* Weibo or WeChat], though `主` censors `谓` *still race to delete* any posts (*chiding* Mr Xi and other national leaders). `主` Posts (*rebuking* lower-level authorities) `谓` *are being allowed* more often than usual. When Hubei Daily, a party newspaper, *warned* readers *to refrain from* rumour-mongering, it *triggered* a sardonic backlash. “I *can only trust* the punctuation marks in Hubei Daily,” *grumbled* a commentator on Weibo. Police *have punished* actual rumour-spreaders, such as a man *detained* in south-eastern China for three days for *(falsely) messaging* friends *about* an infected stranger *roaming* his village. In contrast, `主` eight “rumour-mongers” *punished by* Wuhan police, in a case *announced* on January 1st and *covered prominently by* state media, `系` *were* [in fact] doctors *sharing* early tidings of a strange new virus in a medical WeChat group. In a rare intervention, the Supreme People’s Court *posted* an online article on January 28th *lamenting* the silencing of those doctors.

*Schooled* in the idea that they *live in* an all-knowing surveillance state, Chinese netizens *have reacted with surprise* as the virus campaign *reveals* the authorities’ blind spots. The websites of big state newspapers *have published* lists of more than 100 flights and trains *taken by* infected people, *urging* fellow-passengers *to seek* medical tests. *How come* the authorities *cannot find* passengers [in a split second], *asked* a Weibo user, *adding*: “Aren’t we all 2020-big-data-high-tech now?”

China’s response(n.) to the virus *has been* unmistakably authoritarian(a.), *involving* the locking down of Hubei’s cities, and mandatory(a.) orders *to stay indoors* for a fortnight for those who *leave* Hubei and *head to* such centres as Shanghai. But it *is not* totalitarian(a.). Unlike in the Mao era, when blind loyalty *was demanded* from citizens, the party *has [at times] responded to* public anger *with* a hint of understanding. In a much-discussed state television interview, Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, *offered* to resign(v.) if the public *wished*. Still, his mea culpa *contained* an unsubtle jab *at* his masters in Beijing. *Acknowledging that* the city *had held back* information about the outbreak, Mr Zhou *noted that* he *needed* superiors’ permission *to disclose* news of an infectious disease.

The principle of quarantine *is rarely challenged*, even in Wuhan. Residents (*reached* by telephone) *describe* a mix of community spirit, *such as* ① bakeries(n.) *offering* free food *to* medics, ② a mass singing of the national anthem *out of* apartment windows ③ *as well as* some grumbling about confusing and draconian local decisions. [In a city of 9m people (the mayor *says* another 5m *left*, just before the quarantine *was imposed*, because of the holiday and the virus)] taxis *are* now the only public transport. They *can no longer be hailed* on the streets, however, or *summoned* through an app. They *have been commandeered* by the city. Duties(n.) *include* “emergency runs” such as *ferrying* the sick *to* hospitals, says Wang Jie, a retired taxi driver. Rides *are* free. The city *pays* drivers 600 yuan ($86) a day, more than double what they make [in normal times]. Still, many *fear*(v.) being infected, says Ms Wang. Most *have to buy* their own protective masks, goggles and gloves.



*Ignore* the welcome sign

Hundreds of expatriates *left* Wuhan [on chartered(a.) airliners] this week. `主` Philippe Klein, a French doctor *serving* the city’s expatriate community (Wuhan *is* home *to* big French car factories), `谓` *is staying put*. Dr Klein, whose clinic *is attached to* the Union Hospital, *describes* exhausted(a.) local doctors *being relieved by* military medics, and *by* volunteer doctors from other provinces. `主` The number of new patients *seeking* testing `谓` *had been growing* each day /but *has now stabilised*, he says. Hospital bosses *hope that* the epidemic *will peak* in Wuhan around February 8th. If disease prevention *began slowly*, one reason *was* the cost of being tested, which *put* some locals *off*. Now the state *will pay*. It *has built* field hospitals *to house* those who test positive. “Overall, I am optimistic,” says Dr Klein.

Lu Xiaoyu, an academic who *works* in Australia but who *flew back to* Wuhan for the lunar new year, *says* {morale *is rising*}. `主` Fine weather on January 28th `谓` *brought* residents *out of* their homes. Neighbourhood food shops *have reopened*, *sparing* people *from* stressful trips to large supermarkets. A lingering(a.) concern *involves* discrimination against Wuhan folk both inside and outside China. “We *have turned into* refugees,” he *worries*. Such concerns *are* well-founded. [On January 27th] several dozen people from Shanghai *refused to board* a plane in Japan when they *realised that* a small contingent(n.) from Wuhan *was* aboard. (Their accent *gave them away*.) The incident *went* viral(a.) on China’s social media. Many netizens *backed* the Shanghainese.

The virus *has given* new energy *to* localist sentiment *within* the protest movement in Hong Kong, where anti-mainland prejudice *lurks* [*alongside* a yearning(n.) for greater political freedom]. *Bowing to* public pressure, Hong Kong’s government *is denying* entry *to* Hubei residents and those recently in the province. That *did not stop* someone *posting* online bomb threats /and *demands* to seal(v.) the mainland border, shortly after police *found* three small, home-made explosive devices.

Chinese leaders *insist that* one-party rule *is vital for* stability and progress. The world *will judge*, in due course, *[whether]* their brand of bossy, secretive authoritarianism *helped* to stop a pandemic, *[or]* *let* the coronavirus *spread out of control*. Already, the crisis *is revealing* a country which *talks a lot about* unity /and *is capable of* great feats(n.) of national mobilisation, but which *is easily divided* and *painfully low*(v.) [*on* trust]. That *is* an ailment(n.) for which party bosses *seem* to have no cure.

- pavilion => pavilion原指尖顶大帐蓬，下面供游艺或跳舞用。刮起风时，帐蓬随风起舞，活象一只庞大的蝴蝶。Pavilion一词就是从拉丁语词papilio（蝴蝶）变化来的。而公园里的小巧玲珑的亭子不是很象一个尖顶帐蓬吗？ +

Just one thing *is* missing: people.

Fearful of coronavirus, they *are staying home*. “I’*ll be doing well* if I make a few sales today,” says Li Xinming, manager of a silk-scarf 围巾；披巾；头巾 shop.

Last year Yu Garden *attracted* 700,000 visitors [during the holiday week, peak season for it and its merchants 商人].

This year, Mr Li *says* his losses *might wipe out*(`=*wipe sb/sth out* : to destroy or remove sb/sth completely 彻底消灭；全部摧毁; /*wipe out* :（尤指做滑雪或冲浪等体育运动时）跌倒，翻跌下来`) his earnings for months to come.

豫园位于上海市中心，建于16世纪，由亭台楼阁和池塘组成。人行道上挂满了五颜六色的灯笼，摊位上摆满了饺子，入口处有几十名保安把守，以应对人群。只有一件事是缺失的: 游人。由于害怕冠状病毒，他们都呆在家里。一家丝巾店的经理李新明(音译)说:“如果我今天能卖出一些，我会做得很好的。” 去年，豫园在假日周期间吸引了70万游客，这是豫园及其商家的旺季。今年，李表示，他的亏损可能会抹去他未来几个月的收入。

`主` The question for China, and for the many companies and countries around the world *linked to* its economy, `系` *is* whether Mr Li’s travails(n.)(`=travail : an unpleasant experience or situation that involves a lot of hard work, difficulties and/or suffering 艰苦劳动；煎熬；艰辛；痛苦`) *are indicative*(a.)(`=*~ (of sth)* ( formal ) showing or suggesting sth 表明；标示；显示；暗示`) *of* a much broader problem.

- travail => 来自古法语 travail,痛苦，煎熬，来自通俗拉丁语 tripaliare,折磨，*来自拉丁语 trepalium,刑具， 一种由三根尖木桩组成的折磨工具，来自 tri-,三，词源同 three,palus,柱子，尖桩，词源同 impale,pole.*
====

`主` The obvious reference(`=the act of looking at sth for information 参考；查询；查阅`) point(`=*reference point* : a standard by which sth can be judged or compared 参比点；参照标准`) `系` *is* China’s battle with SARS, another coronavirus, in 2003.

Growth *slowed sharply* at the height 最佳点；最强点；顶点 of the epidemic(n.)流行病 but *rebounded swiftly* 很快地；敏捷地；即刻 after it *was contained*(`=to prevent sth harmful from spreading or getting worse 防止…蔓延（或恶化）;/to keep your feelings under control 控制，克制，抑制（感情）`).

Other recent epidemics *have reinforced*(`=to make a feeling, an idea, etc. stronger 加强；充实；使更强烈`) the impression 印象；感想 that economists *should not be* overly worried, *so long as*(`=*as/so long as* : only if 只要`) good doctors *are* on the job.


*Neither* 两者都不 avian(a.)(`=of or connected with birds 鸟（类）的；关于鸟（类）的`) flu(`=*avian flu* 禽流感`) in 2006 *nor* swine(`=pigs 猪`) flu in 2009 *dimmed*(`=if a feeling or quality dims , or if sth dims it, it becomes less strong （使）减弱，变淡漠，失去光泽`) the global outlook(n.)(`=*~ (for sth)* : the probable future for sb/sth; what is likely to happen 前景；可能性`).

对中国以及世界上许多与中国经济相关的企业和国家来说，问题在于李的遭遇是否表明着一个更广泛的问题。一个明显的参照点是中国在2003年与另一种冠状病毒SARS的斗争。经济增长在疫情最严重时, 急剧放缓，但在得到控制后迅速反弹。最近的其它流行病强化了这样一种印象:只要有好医生仍在工作中，经济学家就不应过度担忧。无论是2006年的禽流感还是2009年的猪流感, 都没有使全球经济前景暗淡。

Yet even flint燧石；火石-hearted 冷酷无情的,铁石心肠的 investors *are wondering* 想知道；想弄明白；琢磨 whether the new epidemic *might be* worse.

Stocks in Hong Kong *have fallen* by nearly 10% [*as* reported infections *have steadily increased*].

Tremors(`=tremor : a small earthquake in which the ground shakes slightly 轻微地震；小震；微震;/（由于寒冷或恐惧等引起的）颤抖，战栗，哆嗦`) *have also rippled*(`=ripple : to move or to make sth move in very small waves （使）如波浪般起伏;/( of a feeling, etc. 感觉等 ) to spread through a person or a group of people like a wave 扩散；涌起`) through global markets.

====
- tremor => 来自拉丁语 tremere,颤抖，恐惧，词源同 tremble.-or,名词后缀。
- ripple => 可能来自 rip,撕开，撕裂，-le,表反复。引申词义波浪，涟漪。
====
然而，即便是铁石心肠的投资者也在怀疑，这种新的流行病是否会变得更糟。香港股市下跌近10%，据报道感染病例稳步增加。震动也波及了全球市场。

The concern *is* less(`=used with uncountable nouns to mean ‘a smaller amount of’ （与不可数名词连用）较少的，更少的`) the severity 严重,性严重程度 of the virus, which *seems* less lethal(a.)致命的；可致死的 than SARS, but rather （提出不同或相反的观点）相反，反而，而是 the nature and potential duration 持续时间；期间 of China’s efforts *to bring* the outbreak *under control*.

And `主` disruption(`=When there is disruption of an event, system, or process, it is prevented from continuing or operating in a normal way. 妨碍; 扰乱`) in China, the world’s second-biggest economy, `谓` *has* global consequences.


“It’s not the disease, it’s the treatment(`=a way of dealing with or discussing a subject, work of art, etc. 处理；讨论；论述;/治疗；疗法；诊治`),” *wrote* analysts 分析师;化验员 with Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy 咨询公司.

The World Bank *has estimated that* as much as 90% of the economic damage(n.) from epidemics *stems from* people’s fear of *associating with* others, which *leads* offices and stores *to close*.

In China, this *is being magnified* 放大 by the government’s policy of *isolating* affected areas and *limiting* interpersonal 人际关系的；人际的 contact throughout the country.

While public-health experts *debate* whether this is the right approach, economists *will count* 计算（或清点）总数 the costs.

人们担心的不是这种病毒的严重程度，而是中国控制疫情的努力的性质和可能持续的时间。而作为世界第二大经济体，中国的混乱也会产生全球性的影响。“问题不在于疾病，而在于治疗，”咨询公司龙洲经讯(Gavekal Dragonomics)的分析师写道。世界银行(World Bank)估计，流行病造成的经济损失中，多达90%, 来自人们对与他人交往的恐惧，这种恐惧导致办公室和商店关门。在中国，这被政府在全国范围内隔离受影响地区和限制人际接触的政策放大了。当公共卫生专家争论这是否是正确的方法时，经济学家则会去计算成本。

The most direct impact *is being felt* in Hubei province.

First Wuhan, its capital, *was placed*(`= ( more formal than put 比put正式 ) to put sb/yourself in a particular situation 使（人）处于某位置；安置；安顿`) under quarantine. Then the rest of the province, home to nearly 60m people, *was locked down*, too.

*Apart from*(`=except for 除了…外（都）；要不是`) food trucks and medical supplies, little *can enter* its cities and villages, and few *are permitted* to leave.

Such a large-scale isolation *is* unprecedented(a.)前所未有的；空前的；没有先例的 as a public-health strategy.

Economic activity of *just about* 几乎，差不多 any kind, *short of* 除…以外 hospital care and movie streaming, *has ground （使）搁浅，触海底 to a halt* 停止；阻止；暂停(`=*grind to a halt /come to a grinding halt* : to go slower gradually and then stop completely 慢慢停下来).

====
- *short of sth.* : 其中一个用法是, *表示条件缺少, 即 "如果没有...; 除了...以外"等*, 常做状语, 有时也做定语. +
-> There's no way to cross the river, *short of  swimming*. 除了游泳之外, 没有其他办法可以过河.
-> Nothing (*short of a miracle*) can save him now. 现在除非出现奇迹, 否则已经无法挽救他了.

Hubei *generates* 4.5% of China’s GDP, so the closure （路或桥的）暂时封闭;（永久的）停业，关闭；倒闭 *will leave* a hole.

湖北省会受到最直接的影响。首先，它的省会武汉被隔离。随后，该省其他地区(近6000万人口的家园)也被封锁。除了食品卡车和医疗用品，几乎没有人能进入城市和村庄，也很少有人被允许离开。作为一项公共卫生战略，这样大规模的隔离是前所未有的。几乎所有类型的经济活动，除了医院护理和电影流媒体，都已经陷入停顿。湖北的GDP占中国GDP的4.5%，所以封城会给中国经济数数据留下一个空洞。

Other cities in China *may not be* under quarantine but that *is* what life *feels like* for their residents.

Instead of *getting together with* family and friends, *attending* temple fairs 庙会, 逛庙会 and *going to* restaurants -- all, *depending on* where one *lives*, staples(`=staple : a large or important part of sth 主要部分；重要内容`) of the holiday -- people *have shut themselves in*(`=*shut sb/yourself in (sth)* : to put sb in a room and keep them there; to go to a room and stay there 把某人（或自己）关在房间里；把…关起来`).

The government *has encouraged* them *to avoid* crowds(n.); many *need* little prodding(n.)(`=encouragement to do sth 催促；督促；鼓励；激励`).

====
- staple => staple通常表示“订书针”，但还可以表示“主要产品、主要成分、主食”等含义。*staple来自古英语，本意就是事物的“支柱或主干”，与staff同源。* 订书针的两个针脚形如两根柱子，所以被称为staple。而古代的市场或仓库通常都立有柱子，所以staple又衍生出“市场、仓库”之意，后来又进一步用来表示市场中销售或仓库中存放的主要物品。
- prodding => 来自prod,刺，戳，捅。比喻用法。
====

中国的其他城市可能没有被隔离，但这就是当地居民的生活。人们把自己关在家里，而不是和家人朋友聚在一起，参加庙会，去餐馆——所有这些都取决于一个人住在哪里，而这些都是假日的主要活动。政府鼓励他们避开人群;很多都不需要什么督促。

That *will be* a drag on consumption 消费. The extent(`=how large, important, serious, etc. sth is 程度；限度`) of the damage *will depend on* how long it *takes* to stop the virus, but the timing *is* already rotten(a.)(`= very bad 非常糟糕的；恶劣的;/腐烂的；腐败的；腐朽的`).

====
- rotten : a.  very bad 非常糟糕的；恶劣的 = terrible +
-> I'*ve had a rotten day*! 我这一天倒霉透了！ +
-> She's *a rotten singer*. 她是个蹩脚的歌手。

Last year retail sales *exceeded* 1trn ($144bn) yuan during the new-year week, a third more than an average week. This year, sales *are sure* to fall(v.) well(ad.)(`=to a great extent or degree 很；相当；大大地；远远地`)  short of(`=*short (of sth)* less than the number, amount or distance mentioned or needed 少于；缺少；未达到`) that.

这将拖累消费。损害的程度将取决于阻止病毒需要多长时间，但时机已经很糟糕了。去年新年当周的零售额, 超过了1万亿人民币(1440亿美元)，比平均水平高出三分之一。今年，销售额肯定会远远低于这个数字。

Some industries 行业 *are being hit(v.) especially hard*. The holiday *accounted for* 9% of China’s box-office 票房 revenues(`=the money that a government receives from taxes or that an organization, etc. receives from its business 财政收入；税收收入；收益`) last year.

This year almost all of the country’s 11,000 cinemas *are closed*. `主` *Spending* on domestic tourism 旅游业；观光业 during the new-year week `谓` *reached* more than 500bn yuan last year, about 8% of the annual total. This year, *fearful of* the virus, people *have cancelled* trips.

一些行业受到的冲击尤其严重。去年，春节假期中的票房, 占中国全年票房收入的9%。今年，全国11000家影院几乎全部关闭。去年新年期间，国内旅游支出超过5000亿元，约占全年总额的8%。今年，由于担心病毒，人们取消了旅行。

There *are* also worries about how the virus *will affect* factories and offices.

Several major economic centres, *including* Shanghai and Guangdong province, *have extended* the new-year holiday by a week, *telling* companies *to wait* until February 10th *to restart*.

Chinese businesses *are* always slow *to get back*(`=*GET STH BACK* : to obtain sth again after having lost it 寻回，找回，重新获得（丢失的东西）`) up to speed 跟上进度 after the holiday.

The extra week *will make them* slower, even if some firms such as Tencent, a tech giant, *let* employees *work* from home.

Moreover, `主` tens of millions of migrant workers, *back* in their hometowns for the holiday, `谓` *may wait for* the epidemic *to recede*(`=(especially of a problem, feeling or quality 尤指问题、感情或品质) to become gradually weaker or smaller 逐渐减弱；慢慢变小;/逐渐远离；渐渐远去`) before *crowding onto*(`=*crowd into/ onto sth crowd in* : to move in large numbers into a small space 大批涌入（狭小的空间）`) trains and buses *to return to* their jobs.

人们还担心这种病毒将如何影响工厂和办公室。包括上海和广东省在内的几个主要经济中心, 已经将春节假期延长了一周，并要求企业等到2月10日才能重新开始。中国企业在假期结束后恢复速度总是很慢。即使像科技巨头腾讯这样的公司允许员工在家工作，额外的一周也会让他们工作更慢。此外，数千万返乡过节的农民工, 可能要等到疫情消退后, 才会挤上火车和公交车, 返回工作岗位。

== 17. China’s coronavirus semi-quarantine will hurt the global economy 纯净版

It *may affect* industries *from* tourism *to* plastic flowers

Jan 30th 2020 | SHANGHAI


THE YU GARDEN, a 16th-century complex of pavilions and ponds in the heart of Shanghai, *is all gussied up* for the Chinese new-year holiday. Its walkways *are bedecked with* colourful lanterns, its stalls *laden with* dumplings, its entrances *flanked by* dozens of security guards *to handle* crowds. Just one thing *is* missing: people. *Fearful of* coronavirus, they *are staying home*. “I’*ll be doing well* if I *make a few sales* today,” says Li Xinming, manager of a silk-scarf shop. Last year Yu Garden *attracted* 700,000 visitors during the holiday week, peak season for it and its merchants. This year, Mr Li *says* his losses *might wipe out* his earnings for months to come.

`主` The question for China, and for the many companies and countries (around the world) (*linked to* its economy), `系` *is* whether Mr Li’s travails *are indicative(a.) of* a much broader problem. The obvious reference point *is* China’s battle with SARS, another coronavirus, in 2003. Growth *slowed sharply* [at the height of the epidemic] but *rebounded swiftly* [after it *was contained*]. Other recent epidemics *have reinforced* the impression that economists *should not be* overly worried, *so long as* good doctors *are* on the job. `主` *Neither* avian flu in 2006 *nor* swine flu in 2009 `谓` *dimmed* the global outlook.

Yet even flint-hearted investors *are wondering* whether the new epidemic *might be* worse. Stocks in Hong Kong *have fallen* by nearly 10% [as reported infections *have steadily increased*]. Tremors *have also rippled* through global markets.

The concern *is* less the severity of the virus, which *seems* less lethal than SARS, *but rather* the nature and potential duration of China’s efforts *to bring* the outbreak *under control*. And `主` disruption in China, the world’s second-biggest economy, `谓` *has* global consequences. “It’s not the disease, it’s the treatment,” *wrote* analysts with Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy. The World Bank *has estimated that* `主` as much as 90% of the economic damage from epidemics `谓` *stems from* people’s fear of *associating with* others, which *leads* offices and stores *to close*. In China, this *is being magnified* by the government’s policy of *isolating* affected areas /and *limiting* interpersonal contact(n.) throughout the country. While public-health experts *debate* whether this *is* the right approach, economists *will count the costs*.

The most direct impact *is being felt* in Hubei province. First Wuhan, its capital, *was placed* under quarantine. Then the rest of the province, home to nearly 60m people, *was locked down*, too. *Apart from* food trucks and medical supplies, little *can enter* its cities and villages, and few *are permitted to leave*. Such a large-scale isolation *is* unprecedented(a.) as a public-health strategy. `主` Economic activity of *just about* any kind, *short of* hospital care and movie streaming, `谓` *has ground to* a halt. Hubei *generates* 4.5% of China’s GDP, so the closure *will leave a hole*.

Other cities in China *may not be* under quarantine /but that *is* `表` what life *feels like* for their residents. Instead of *getting together with* family and friends, *attending* temple fairs /and *going to* restaurants—all, [*depending on* where one lives, staples(n.) of the holiday] -- people *have shut themselves in*. The government *has encouraged* them *to avoid crowds*; many *need* little 几乎没有,相当于一个否定词 prodding.

That *will be* a drag on consumption. The extent of the damage *will depend on* how long it *takes* to stop the virus, but the timing *is* already rotten. [Last year] retail sales *exceeded* 1trn ($144bn) yuan during the new-year week, a third more than an average week. This year, sales *are* sure *to fall well(ad.)* short of that.

Some industries *are being hit especially hard*. The holiday *accounted for* 9% of China’s box-office revenues last year. This year almost all of the country’s 11,000 cinemas *are closed*. `主` Spending(n.) on domestic tourism during the new-year week `谓` *reached* more than 500bn yuan last year, about 8% of the annual total. This year, *fearful of* the virus, people *have cancelled* trips.

There *are* also worries(n.) about how the virus *will affect* factories and offices. `主` Several major economic centres, *including* Shanghai and Guangdong province, `谓` *have extended* the new-year holiday by a week, *telling* companies *to wait* until February 10th *to restart*. Chinese businesses *are* always slow *to get back* up to speed after the holiday. The extra week *will make them slower*, even if some firms such as Tencent, a tech giant, *let* employees *work* from home. Moreover, tens of millions of migrant workers, *back* in their hometowns for the holiday, *may wait* for the epidemic *to recede* [before *crowding* onto trains and buses *to return to* their jobs].

I *feel* your pain

One crucial difference *compared with* SARS *is* China’s importance for the rest of the world. In 2003 China *generated* 4% of global GDP. Last year, it *was* 16%. `主` The slowdown in consumption and the disruption to production `谓` *will not stop* at its borders.

China’s government *has ordered* all tour groups *to be suspended* until the virus *is contained*.

Factory closures *will cascade* through the global economy. Wuhan *is* a manufacturing hub, especially for autos. Nissan, Honda and General Motors *have* plants there. Bloomberg *ranks* Wuhan 13th *out of* 2,000 Chinese cities for its role in supply chains.

Others *are* less so; China *supplies* 90% of the world’s plastic flowers. Shares in Foxconn, which *makes* phones *for* Apple, *have fallen* by 10%.

The death toll from the coronavirus *is rising*. And the whole country *is paying* a price.
