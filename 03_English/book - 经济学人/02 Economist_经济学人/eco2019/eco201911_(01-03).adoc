But it is also a consequence 事情发生的结果；后果 of China’s notorious(a.)声名狼藉的；臭名昭著的 population-control strategy.

In 1973, when the government *started* limiting births, `主` Chinese women `谓` *averaged*(v.) 平均为 4.6 children each. Today they *have* only 1.6, and some scholars *say* {even that estimate is too high}.

劳动年龄人口在2012年开始减少，未来几十年还将继续减少。


The economic impact *is being felt* [in two main ways].

The most obvious(a.) `系` *is* the need *to look after* all the old people.

Pension 养老金；退休金 payouts 付出的巨款 to retired people `谓` *overtook* contributions （给雇主或政府用作医疗保险、养老金等津贴的）定期缴款 by workers in 2014.

According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 中国社会科学院, `主` the national pension fund `谓` *could run out of money* by 2035.

The finance ministry 有特定职责的政府部门 *is taking* small steps *to shore* the system *up* 用大块的木头或金属,支撑住建筑物或其他大型结构的一部分，使其不倒下; 用撑柱支撑 : [in September] it *transferred* （使）转移，搬迁 10% of its stakes 股本；股份 in four giant state-owned financial firms *to* the fund. But far more *is needed*.

Government spending(n.) on pensions and health care `系` *is* about a tenth of GDP, just *over* half the level (usual 通常的；寻常的；惯常的 in older, wealthier countries, which themselves *will have to spend* more *as* they get even older).

====
- shore : N a prop, post, or beam used to support a wall, building, ship in dry dock, etc 支柱 /在干船坞中用来支撑墙、建筑物、船等的支柱、柱子或梁
- *shore sth up* : (1) *to support* part of a building or other large structure *by placing large pieces of wood or metal against or under it* so that it does not fall down 用撑柱支撑 +
(2) *to help to support sth that is weak or going to fail* 支撑；稳住
====

政府在养老金和医疗保健上的支出, 约占GDP的十分之一，仅为较老、较富裕国家通常水平的一半多一点.

The second impact *is* on growth.

Some Chinese economists --  notably(ad.)尤其 Justin Lin 林毅夫 of Peking University -- *maintain* 即使别人不同意或不相信，也要坚持说某事是真的; 坚持（意见）；固执己见 that {ageing(n.) *need not slow* the country down, in part *thanks to* technological advances}.

But another camp 阵营（指观点相同且与持不同观点者对立的集团）, *led by* Cai Fang 蔡昉 of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, `谓` *has been winning* the argument so far.

A shrinking labour pool *is pushing up* wages 工资 and, [*as* firms 公司 *spend* more *on* technology *to replace* workers], *pushing down* returns on capital investment.

The upshot 一系列事件的最终结果；结局, Mr Cai *calculates*, `系` *is that* {China’s potential growth rate *has fallen to* about 6.2%} -- almost exactly 恰好,正是如此 where it is today.

The labour shortage *is hitting(v.) not* just companies *but* entire cities.

[*From* Xi’an in the north *to* Shenzhen in the south], `主` municipalities 可以选举自己的政府的城市或城镇;自治市 `谓` *have made* it easier *for* university graduates 大学毕业生；学士学位获得者 *to move in*, *hoping* thereby *to attract* skilled young workers.

随着企业加大技术投入以取代劳动力，资本投资的回报率也在下降。 +
各市都为大学毕业生提供了更便利的条件，希望借此吸引有技能的年轻工人。

`主` China *could*, in theory, `谓` *mitigate* 使某事物不那么有害、严重等; 减轻；缓和 the downside 某事物的缺点或不那么积极的方面;不利方面 *from* its ageing *by boosting* 使某事物增加，变得更好或更成功; 使增长；使兴旺 both labour-force participation and productivity -- that is, *getting* more people *into* work /and more out of them.

Neither is easy.

Retirement ages *are* very low in China (in many jobs, 60 for men /and 50 for women), but the government *has resisted* raising them *for fear of* a backlash(n.)（对社会变动等的）强烈抵制，集体反对.

And a return to state-led 国家主导的 growth under Xi Jinping `谓` *appears* to be hurting productivity.

As George Magnus, an economist, *writes* in “Red Flags: Why Xi’s China is *in Jeopardy*(n.) 处于危险的位置或情况，可能会迷路或受伤;处于危险境地；受到威胁”, demography 人口统计学 *is not* destiny 发生在某人身上或将来会发生在他们身上的事情，尤其是他们无法改变或避免的事情; 命运,定数, and China *has* time *to change course*.

“The bad news, though, *is that* {the time (that is available) *is passing by rapidly*},” he says.

====
- mitigate => 来自拉丁语mitigare,成熟，变软，温顺，来自mitis,成熟的，柔软的，-ig,做，词源同agent.引申词义减轻，缓和。
- backlash : N-SING A *backlash against* a tendency or recent development in society or politics is *a sudden, strong reaction against it*. (对政治或社会变化的) 强烈反应 +
...*the male backlash*(n.) against feminism.  …男性对女权主义的强烈反应。

- Jeopardy :PHRASE If someone or something is *in jeopardy*, they are *in a dangerous situation where they might fail, be lost, or be destroyed*. 处于险境
====

One piece of good news *is that* China *is thinking creatively about* how to look after the swelling 膨胀；肿胀 ranks 一行或一排人或物 of pensioners 领养老金（或退休金、抚恤金）者.

Traditionally, children *have been expected* to care for their elderly parents, which *helps explain* why public investment in old-age homes 养老院 *has been* minimal.

But most families now *have* just one child, and that child *is working*.

Suzhou, a wealthy city near Shanghai, *shows* how China *can take advantage of* its scale.

In 2007 Lu Zhong 人名, an entrepreneur 创业者，企业家（尤指涉及财务风险的）, *founded* Jujiale 居家乐 *as* a “virtual retirement home”, *dispatching* 送某人[某物]到某地，尤指为特殊目的;派遣；调遣；派出 helpers *to* private homes [on demand].

It now *has* 1,800 employees *serving* 130,000 retired people. ⑦ Mr Lu says that {it *needs to grow* by about 15% a year *to keep up with* demand}.

====
- *swell (v.)~ (up)* : to become bigger or rounder 膨胀；肿胀 +
-> Her arm was beginning *to swell up* where the bee had stung her. 她胳膊给蜜蜂蜇了，肿了起来。 +
- *swell (v.)~ (sth) (to sth)* : *to increase or make sth increase in number or size* （使）增加，增大，扩大 + 
-> Last year's *profits were swelled* by a fall in production costs. 去年因生产成本下降，利润有所增加。
====


Yet that *is* a silver lining 内衬；衬里 in a grey-haired cloud.

[On October 1st] China *celebrated* the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic.

By the centenary 第100周年纪念 in 2049, Mr Xi *has vowed* 作出正式而严肃的承诺,或真实的正式声明;起誓；立誓；发誓, China *will have developed to the point that* its strength is plain(a.)容易看到或理解的;清楚的；明显的 for the world to see.

But as Ren Zeping 任泽平, a prominent 重要的；著名的；杰出的 economist, *tartly(`=说话尖锐而令人不快地`) noted* in a recent report, the median age in China in 2050 *will be* nearly 50, *compared with* 42 in America and just 38 in India.

That, he wrote, *raised* a question: “Can we *rely on* this kind of demographic structure *to achieve* national rejuvenation 恢复到更年轻状态的行为; 返老还童；恢复活力?”

====
- lining : N-VAR The lining of something such as a piece of clothing or a curtain is *a layer of cloth attached to the inside of it* in order to make it thicker or warmer, or in order to make it hang better. 内衬

- plain : ADJ If a fact, situation, or statement is plain, *it is easy to recognize or understand*. 清楚的 +
-> *He made it plain that* we should leave. 他明确表示要我们离开。 +
-> The facts *were plain to see* . 事实显而易见。

- tart :  酸的；酸涩的 / 尖酸的；刻薄的 => 来自古法语 tarte, 甜馅饼， 来 自拉丁语 torta panis, *来自 torta, 旋转的，扭曲的*， 词源同 torture,panis,面包，词源同 pantry.引申俚语义妓女，骚货。

== 01 - Chinese demography: Old, not yet rich 纯净版

Old, not yet rich

China’s median age *will soon overtake* America’s

Demography *may be* the Chinese economy’s biggest challenge

Nov 2nd 2019 | SHANGHAI

SHORTLY AFTER 9am the neighbourhood care centre for the elderly *shuffles to life*. One man *belts out* a folk song. A centenarian *sits by* his Chinese chessboard, *awaiting* an opponent. A virtual-reality machine, which *lets* users *experience* such exotic adventures *as* grocery shopping and *taking* the subway, *sits* unused in the corner.

Dear Dean Whiteboard,

*ON BEHALF OF* 代表（或代替）某人 the trustees(`=someone with legal control of money or property that is kept or invested for another person, company, or organization`)（财产的）受托人 of the Gordon Gekko Business School, I *write* with a helicopter view on our beloved(`=you feel great affection for`) institution. ② There is good news and bad. First, congratulations *are* in order. Under your leadership, GorGeBS *has again been named by* The Economist *as* one of the world’s top 100 business schools.
====
- 文中所说的“戈登盖柯商学院”实际上并不存在，这里只是代指了MBA的精英商学院，以此来展开对MBA教育的探讨。在后面将其简写为了GorGeBS。
- First, congratulations are in order.
*这里的 In order指的依次、按顺序。* 前一句中作者说了有好消息，还有坏消息。紧跟着作者就先祝贺，说好消息。
- *in order (to do sth)* : ( formal ) allowed according to the rules of a meeting, etc. 符合议事规则 +
-> Is it *in order* to speak now? 依规定现在可以发言了吗？
- Helicopter view : a general description or opinion of a situation, rather than a detailed one.
====

The bad news is that {`主` our best-of-breed(a.)(`=denoting the most successful technology in a particular field`) status `系` *is* in jeopardy(n.)(`=in a dangerous position or situation and likely to be lost or harmed`) because `主` the very business model of our school `谓` *faces* tectonic(`=relating to the structure of the Earth's surface or crust`) challenges (see article)}. ② Demand *is plunging*(`=to decrease suddenly and quickly`). Our MBA applications(`=a formal (often written) request for sth`) *are down* by a quarter. ③ Across America, applications to business schools *have fallen* for five years [in a row](`=it happens in exactly the same way each time`). ⑤ Even at Harvard, they *are down* this year by about 6%.
====
- our best-of-breed status is in jeopardy : Breed作名词讲，可以指（动植物的）品种，种类，也可以指不同类型的人或物的种类，文中best-of-breed status（品种）最优的地位
-  in jeopardy : PHRASE If someone or something is *in jeopardy*, they are *in a dangerous situation where they might fail, be lost, or be destroyed*. 处于危险境地；受到威胁

- tectonic => 来自希腊语 tekton,建造，构造，来自 PIE*teks,纺织，编织，词源同 texture,technology.后特别用于指地壳板块形成或构造。 +
Tectonic形容词，本意指地壳构造的，引申义用来指（变化、发展等）非常重要的；具有重大影响的，可与significant, substantial, major, earthshaking 等替换. +
-> He led the company *through a period of tectonic shifts* in the movie industry.
他领导公司度过了一段电影业发生了翻天覆地变化的时期。

- plunge : (v.)( of prices, temperatures, etc. 价格、温度等 ) *to decrease suddenly and quickly* 暴跌；骤降；突降
- plunging : ( of a dress, blouse , etc. 连衣裙、女衬衫等 ) cut in a deep V shape at the front 低领的；凹领的；深开领的

- *in a row* : if sth happens several times in a row , *it happens in exactly the same way each time*, and nothing different happens in the time between 连续几次地;接连几天（等）地 +
-> Inflation *has fallen* for the third month *in a row*. 通货膨胀率连续第三个月在下降。

- 在表述“连续N天/月/年”这样的概念时，在外刊中常见的表达有以下几种： +
* For N consecutive days and counting（注意and counting有持续增长的意思） +
* N Successive days +
* N days/months/years, etc. running (这里注意running置于数字和year、day或time等名词后，表示同样的事一再重复，连续) +
* N days/months/years, etc. in a row
for hours, days, etc. on end : 连续数小时／几天（等等）
====

One reason *is* a drop in international applicants, many of whom *are put off*(`=to cancel a meeting or an arrangement`) by America’s anti-immigration policies. ② But before you *rush to blame* all those law graduates *staffing*(`=to work in an institution, a company, etc.; to provide people to work there`) up government departments, the bigger factor is that {we *are charging*(`=to ask an amount of money for goods or a service`) too much}. ③ Our MBA costs *nearly twice as much as* it did a decade ago, but nobody *believes* {we are *delivering*(`=to take sb somewhere`) twice as much value}.

-> *Don't put me off* when I'm trying to concentrate. 别在我要集中精神时打扰我。

- But before you rush to blame ..., the bigger factor is that we are charging too much. 
Before从句所指之事，有时其实是"你不希望它发生, 或你希望避免它发生"的事情，当表达这个意思时，翻译成“在……之前”就不太合适了。因此翻译成“不要急着(去做不应该去做的事)……”更符合语境，而不是“在急着(批判已经做的事情)……之前”。 +
一些通常同否定相联系的副词，也会出现在before引导的从句之中，比如：
-> The Fed would tolerate a recession *before* again permitting inflation to go bunkers. 联储大概会宁可容忍一次衰退，也不会再让通货膨胀成为脱缰之马。

- *Fail to do sth 本意指失败，后多用来指"未能做到某事"，可以指“想做而做不成”，也可以指 “本应该做而没有做”*，也是外刊中的常见表达： +

- Even so, I am beginning to think that your dogged defence of *a bricks-and-mortar strategy* is wrong-headed.  +
*Bricks and mortar 字面意思指砖和泥浆，中间不加连字符可以指“房产；有形资产”，中间加连字符可以用作形容词Bricks-and-mortar 指实体的、线下的，与“online线上的”对应*： +

我们也未能应对技术颠覆。我在兰德河源头绿树成荫的校园里攻读MBA的时光，是我人生中最美好的两年。即便如此，我开始认为，你执意死守实体战略是错误的。在线商业教育也可以提供一流的思想领导力。

如今，在我们神圣的殿堂里徜徉的学生，不再是那些曾经为商学学位而奋斗的热血的、达尔文主义的资本家。他们处在一个非常不同的思维空间，要求我们超越传统的关于股东价值至上的教导，囊括利益相关者价值。

Going forward, we need three priorities(`=the most important thing you have to do or deal with before everything else you have to do`). ② First, *to get* costs *under control*. The soup-to-nuts 一应俱全;应有尽有,全过程 cost for an MBA at Stanford *is* $232,000 -- out of our ballpark(`=an area or a range within which an amount is likely to be correct or within which sth can be measured （数额的）变动范围；可量范围`). ③ `主` The five-star accommodation(`=a place to live, work or stay in`), gourmet(`=a person who knows a lot about good food and wines and who enjoys choosing, eating and drinking them`) cuisine(`=the food served in a restaurant (usually an expensive one)`) and other perks(`=something you receive as well as your wages for doing a particular job`) on our campus(`=the buildings of a university or college and the land around them`) `系` *are* way(`=a particular condition or state`) over the top. ④ So *are* some of our packages, even if we *haven’t got* quite as *carried away*(`=to get very excited or lose control of your feelings`) as Columbia Business School, which, it *was recently revealed*(`=to make sth known to sb`), *paid* over $420,000 a year *to* a professor (teaching three classes a year) and $330,000 *to* untenured (学术或其他职位)非永久性的,非终身职位的 junior(`=having a low rank in an organization or a profession`) faculty(`=all the teachers of a particular university or college`).

- *BE/GET CARRIED AWAY* : to get very excited or lose control of your feelings 变得很激动；失去自制力 +
-> *I got carried away* and started shouting at the television. 我激动得不能自持，冲着电视机大叫起来。

- tenured : ( of an official job 公职 ) that you can keep permanently 终身的；长期保有的 +
=>  -ten-握,持有 + -ure名词词尾 +
-> a tenured post 终身职位

- junior => 字母J十分年轻，最初是根据字母 i 派生而来的。Y做辅音时和J发音类似，二者有时可以通转，如 *junior（年少的）中的jun-对应于young（年轻的）中的youn。* 同源词juvenile（青少年的）。推荐喜剧电影《奇怪的她》，关于返老还童，欢乐且温馨。

展望未来，我们需要三个重点。首先，控制成本。斯坦福大学MBA的全覆盖费用是23.2万美元，一个超出我们预算的数字。我们学校五星级的住宿、美食和其他福利实在是太好了。我们的一些薪酬也是如此，尽管我们还没有像哥伦比亚商学院那样欣喜若狂。最近有消息披露，哥伦比亚商学院每年向每位教授支付42万美元，一年教三门课，还向未获得终身职位的初级教师支付33万美元。

But that is low-hanging 低悬的;容易得到的 fruit. We also *should embrace* technology. ② Some schools *offer* hybrid 杂交的;（不同事物的）混合物 degrees, *mixing* the soft skills learned on campus *with* the convenience of digital delivery(`=the way in which sb speaks, sings a song, etc. in public`). ③ Boston University’s Questrom School of Business *has gone the whole hog*(`=to do sth thoroughly or completely`) and now *offers* its full MBA online for just $24,000. ④ [If we *do not adapt*(`=to change your behaviour in order to deal more successfully with a new situation`)] it *will eat* our lunch. ⑤ And we *need to get better* at teaching technology. ⑥ Our curriculum *ought to drill down*(`=to go to deeper levels of an organized set of data on a computer or a website in order to find more detail`) on the technical skills employers want, *to deal with* artificial intelligence and data analytics. ⑦ *No wonder* {firms themselves *are stepping up*(`=to come forward`)}. ⑧ Accenture 埃森哲咨询公司 alone *spends* $1bn *training* staff in-house(a./ad.)(`=existing or happening within a company or an organization`); the Silicon Valley giants *spend* even more. ⑨ Those investments *are cannibalising*(`=to reduce the sales of one of its products by introducing a similar new product`) executive education, our cash cow 母牛；奶牛.

====

但那是唾手可得的成果。我们也应该结合技术。有些学校提供混合型学位，将在校学到的软技能与数字化授课的便利结合起来。波士顿大学奎斯特罗姆商学院不惜一切代价，现在仅以2.4万美元的价格在线提供其完整的MBA课程。如果我们不适应，它会吃掉我们的午餐。我们需要在教学技术方面做得更好。我们的课程应该深入挖掘雇主需要的技术技能，以应对人工智能和数据分析。难怪公司自己也在加紧步伐。仅埃森哲一家就花费10亿美元内部培训员工；硅谷巨头们的花费甚至更多。这些投资正在蚕食我们的摇钱树——高管教育。

The trickiest(`=difficult to do or deal with`) challenge *is dealing with* the backlash against capitalism. ② As future CEOs, our charges *must manage* the conflicting demands (*placed on* firms *by* myriad(`=an extremely large number of sth`) interested parties) *while still fulfilling* their fiduciary(`=involving trust, especially in a situation where a person or company controls money or property belonging to others`) duties *to* shareholders. ③ The curriculum *can no longer rely on* one-dimensional 一维, 单向度 case studies.

-> ...*the trade-off* between inflation and unemployment.  ...通胀和失业之间的妥协。
====

最棘手的挑战是应对资本主义的反弹。作为未来的首席执行官，我们的职责必须处理好无数利益相关方对公司提出的相互冲突的要求，同时还要履行对股东的受托责任。课程不能再依赖单一的个案研究。我们需要更好地回放在3D环境中老板们面临的权衡。

威胁是存在的。在过去的五年里，美国近十分之一的全日制MBA课程消失了。从佛罗里达州到爱荷华州，商学院已经完全停止提供这种学位。如果我们想要生存下去，不要只追求把戈登•盖柯商学院提升到排行榜的顶端，我们需要开始跳出固有思维模式，引领下一次管理革命。 +
让我们尽快触底反弹。

The future of management education

We *have obtained* a copy of a recent letter to a business dean


Nov 2nd 2019

Dear Dean Whiteboard,

*ON BEHALF OF* the trustees of the Gordon Gekko Business School, I *write* with a helicopter view *on* our beloved institution. There is good news and bad. First, congratulations *are* in order. Under your leadership, GorGeBS *has again been named by* The Economist *as* one of the world’s top 100 business schools.

The bad news is that {our best-of-breed status *is* in jeopardy because the very business model of our school *faces* tectonic challenges (see article)}. Demand *is plunging*. Our MBA applications *are down* by a quarter. Across America, applications to business schools *have fallen* for five years in a row. Even at Harvard, they *are down* this year by about 6%.

One reason *is* a drop in international applicants, many of whom *are put off* by America’s anti-immigration policies. But before you *rush to blame* all those law graduates *staffing* up government departments, the bigger factor is that {we *are charging* too much}. Our MBA *costs* nearly twice as much as it did a decade ago, but nobody *believes* {we *are delivering* twice as much value}.

We *are also failing to grapple with* technological disruption. The time (I *spent* getting my MBA on our leafy campus by the fountainhead of the River Rand) *constituted* two of the best years of my life. Even so, I *am beginning to think* that {your dogged defence of a bricks-and-mortar strategy *is* wrong-headed}. Online business education *can deliver* world-class thought leadership, too.

Worse, the relevance of our curriculum *is being challenged*. The students (*roaming* our hallowed halls today) *are not* the red-blooded, Darwinian capitalists who *used to strive for* business degrees. They *are* in a very different mind space, *demanding* that {we *go beyond* our traditional teachings on the primacy of shareholder value *to embrace* stakeholder value}.

*Going forward*, we *need* three priorities. First, *to get* costs *under control*. The soup-to-nuts cost(n.) for an MBA at Stanford *is* $232,000 — out of our ballpark. The five-star accommodation, gourmet cuisine and other perks on our campus *are* way(n.) over the top. So *are* some of our packages, even if we *haven’t got* quite *as carried away as* Columbia Business School, which, it *was recently revealed*, *paid* over $420,000 a year *to* a professor (*teaching* three classes a year) /and $330,000 *to* untenured junior faculty.

But that *is* low-hanging fruit. We also *should embrace* technology. Some schools *offer* hybrid degrees, *mixing* the soft skills (learned on campus) *with* the convenience of digital delivery. Boston University’s Questrom School of Business *has gone the whole hog* and now *offers* its full MBA online *for* just $24,000. [If we *do not adapt*] it *will eat* our lunch. And we *need to get better* at teaching technology. Our curriculum *ought to drill down* on the technical skills (employers *want*), *to deal with* artificial intelligence and data analytics. *No wonder* {firms themselves *are stepping up*}. Accenture alone *spends* $1bn training staff in-house; the Silicon Valley giants *spend* even more. Those investments *are cannibalising* executive education, our cash cow.

The trickiest challenge *is dealing with* the backlash against capitalism. As future CEOs, our charges *must manage* the conflicting demands (*placed on* firms by myriad interested parties) while still *fulfilling* their fiduciary duties *to* shareholders. The curriculum *can no longer rely on* one-dimensional case studies. We *need to be better* at *playing back* the trade-offs (*facing* bosses *navigating* a 3D environment).

The threat *is* existential. In the past five years, nearly a tenth of the full-time MBA programmes in America *have disappeared*. From Florida to Iowa, business schools *have stopped offering* the degree altogether. If we *are to survive*, *never mind* {*elevate* GorGeBS *to* the top of the rankings}, we *need to start thinking* outside the box and *spearhead*(v.) the next management revolution.

Let’s *touch base* offline soon.

== 03 How to reveal a country’s sense, over the years, of its own well-being

*DO* A COUNTRY’S inhabitants(`=a person or an animal that lives in a particular place`) *get happier* as it gets richer? ② Most governments *seem to believe so*, *given* their relentless(a.)(`=not stopping or getting less strong`) focus on *increasing GDP* year by year. ③ Reliable(`=that is likely to be correct or true`), long-term evidence (*linking* wealth *and* happiness) *is, however, lacking*. ④ And `主` measuring(v.) well-being `系` *is [itself] fraught(a.)(`=filled with sth unpleasant`) with problems*, since it *often relies on* surveys that *ask* participants *to assess*(`=to make a judgement about the nature or quality of sb/sth`) their own levels of happiness [*subjectively*] 主观地；臆想地.

====
- *fraught : adj. ~ with sth* : filled with sth unpleasant 充满（不愉快事物）的 +
=> 来自freight(（海运、空运或陆运的）货物；货运)的拼写变体，原指船只装满货物的，满载的。后来该词用于心理学术语，指心里面装满担子的，忧虑的。/ freight => 来自Proto-Germanic*fra-aigan, *fra, 整个的，*aigan, 拥有，所有，词源同own.即所有物，装上船的，发货的。其原义仅指水运或船运，后词义通用化。 +
-> a situation *fraught with danger/difficulty/problems* 充满危险╱困难重重╱问题成堆的局面

一个国家越富有，它的居民就越幸福吗?大多数政府似乎都是这么认为的，因为他们一直致力于逐年提高GDP。然而，将财富和幸福联系起来的可靠而长期的证据是缺乏的。衡量幸福本身就充满了问题，因为它往往依赖于调查，要求参与者主观地评估自己的幸福水平。

Daniel Sgroi of the University of Warwick /and Eugenio Proto of the University of Glasgow, both in Britain, *think*, nevertheless(adv.)(`=despite sth that you have just mentioned 尽管如此；不过；然而`), that {they *have* an answer}. ② By *examining*(`=look at it carefully`) millions of books and newspaper articles *published* since 1820 in four countries (America, Britain, Germany and Italy), `主` they *have developed* what (they *hope*) *is* an objective(a.)(`=not influenced by personal feelings or opinions; considering only facts`) measure of each place’s historical happiness. ③ And their answer *is* that {wealth *does bring* happiness, but some other things *bring* more of it}.

然而，英国华威大学的丹尼尔·斯格里, 和格拉斯哥大学的尤金尼奥·普罗托认为, 他们找到了答案。通过研究自1820年以来四个国家(美国、英国、德国和意大利)出版的数百万本书籍和报纸文章，研究人员开发出了一种客观衡量各地历史幸福程度的方法。他们的答案是，财富确实能带来幸福，但其他一些东西能带来更多的幸福。


Previous research *has shown that* `主` people’s underlying(a.)(`=existing under the surface of sth else /important in a situation but not always easily noticed or stated clearly`) levels of happiness `谓` *are reflected in* what they say or write. ② Dr Sgroi and Dr Proto therefore *consulted*(`=to look in or at sth to get information`) newspaper archives(a.)(`=a collection of historical documents or records of a government, a family, a place or an organization; the place where these records are stored`) and Google Books, a collection of more than 8m titles that *constitute*(`=to be the parts that together form sth`) around(`=approximately`) 6% of all books *physically published*. ③ They *searched* these texts *for* words that *had been assigned*(`=to give sb sth that they can use, or some work or responsibility`) a psychological “valence”(n.)化合价；原子价 -- a value *representing* how emotionally positive(a.)(`=thinking about what is good in a situation; feeling confident and sure that sth good will happen`) or negative(a.)(`=considering only the bad side of sth/sb; lacking enthusiasm or hope`) a word is -- while *controlling for* the changing meanings of words such as “gay” and “awful”(`=very bad or unpleasant`) (which once most commonly meant “to inspire awe”). ④ The result *is* the National Valence Index, *published* this week *in* Nature Human Behaviour.

先前的研究表明，人们潜在的幸福水平, 反映在他们所说或所写的东西上。因此，Sgroi博士和Proto博士查阅了报纸档案和谷歌图书，这些图书超过800万种，占实际出版图书的6%。他们在这些文本中搜索那些被赋予心理“原子价”的词 —— 一个代表一个词在情感上是积极的还是消极的值 —— 同时控制诸如“同性恋”和“可怕的”(曾经最常见的意思是“让人敬畏的”)等词含义的变化。其结果就是本周发表在《自然·人类行为》杂志上的国家乐观悲观度指数。

*Placed alongside* the timeline of history (see chart), the valence indices(index的复数) for the places under study *show* {how `主` changes (in national happiness) `谓` *reflect* important events}. ② In Britain, for example, happiness *fell sharply*(`=suddenly and by a large amount`) during the two world wars. ③ It *began to rise again* after 1945, *peaked* in 1950, and then *fell gradually*, *including through* the so-called Swinging(`=lively and fashionable`) Sixties, until it *reached* a nadir(`=the worst moment of a particular situation`) around 1980.

====
- nadir => 来自阿拉伯语nazir,相反的，来自nazir as-samt,反方向的，与天顶相反的底点，词源同zenith.后引申词义最低点。
====

与历史年表一起(见图表)，研究地区的原子价指数, 显示了国家幸福指数的变化是如何反映重要事件的。例如，在英国，幸福感在两次世界大战期间急剧下降。它在1945年后开始再次上升，在1950年达到顶峰，然后逐渐下降，包括所谓的摇摆60年代，直到1980年左右达到最低点。

America’s national happiness, too, *fell* during the world wars. ② It also *fell* in the 1860s, during and after the country’s civil war. ③ The lowest point of all *came* in 1975, at the end of a long decline during the Vietnam war, with the fall of Saigon and America’s humiliating(a.)(`=it embarrasses you and makes you feel ashamed and stupid`) defeat(`=failure to win or to be successful`).
====
- humiliate => 来自拉丁语humilis,尘土一样的，卑微的，来自humus,土，尘土，词源同humus,-ate,使。即使像尘土一样卑微的，引申词义羞辱。
====

美国国民的幸福感也在两次世界大战期间下降了。19世纪60年代内战期间及之后的几年里, 其国民幸福感同样出现了下降。越战期间幸福感长期下滑。1975年，美国在西贡被攻陷后狼狈撤退，同年国民幸福感也跌至该国史上最低水平。

In Germany and Italy the first world war also *caused* dips(`=a decrease in the amount or success of sth, usually for only a short period`) in happiness. ② By contrast, during the second world war these countries both *got happier* as the war continued. ③ Initially, that *might be put down to*(`=you believe that it is caused by that thing. 把…归因于`) their early successes, but this *can hardly explain* German happiness when the Red Army *was* at the gates of Berlin. ④ The researchers *hypothesise*(`= hypothesize : to suggest a way of explaining sth when you do not definitely know about it; to form a hypothesis`) that {`主` what *is being measured here* `系` *is* the result of propaganda(n.)(`= ideas or statements that may be false or exaggerated and that are used in order to gain support for a political leader, party, etc`) and censorship(`= the act or policy of censoring books, etc`), rather than honest opinion}. ⑤ But they *cannot prove*(`=to use facts, evidence, etc. to show that sth is true`) this. ⑥ Earlier in Italian history, though, there *was* a clear and explicable(`=that can be explained or understood`) crash(`=an accident in which a vehicle hits sth`) in happiness in 1848, with the failure of revolutions (*intended to unite into* a single nation (what *were* then half a dozen disparate(a.)(`=made up of parts or people that are very different from each other`) states)). ⑦ Surprisingly, however, successful unification(`=the process by which two or more countries join together and become one country`) in the 1860s *also saw* a fall in happiness.

====
- put down to : PHRASAL VERB If you *put* something *down to* a particular thing, you believe that it is caused by that thing. 把…归因于
- hypothesis => hypo-,在下，-thes,放置，词源同thesis,theme,do. 即放在下面的，引申词义假说，假设。
- propaganda => 来自拉丁语propagare,延伸，扩展，繁殖，词源同propagate,-and,动名词后缀，-a,表阴性。引申词义宣传者，传道者。
- explicate => ex-, 向外。-plic, 卷，卷入，词源同imply, implicate. 即展开，卷开，解释。
====

德国和意大利也因第一次世界大战而幸福感下降。而在二战期间，随着战事的推进，两国的国民幸福感都提升了。一开始，这或许可被归因为两国早期的成功，但苏联红军即将攻入柏林之际德国人的幸福感还那么高就很难解释了。研究人员推测，这里所衡量到的数据是政治宣传和审查制度的结果，而不是真实的想法。但他们无法证实这一点。不过，往前追溯意大利历史会发现，在1848年发生了一次显而易见且易于解释的幸福感暴跌：当时旨在统一意大利六个邦国的革命以失败告终。然而令人惊讶的是，19世纪60年代成功统一后，幸福感也下降了。

*As to* 至于，关于；就……而论 wealth, the steady progress of the Victorian period *matched*(`=are as good as it or equal to it, for example in speed, size, or quality`) a steady increase in British happiness, as(`=used to say that sth happens in the same way （指事情以同样的方式发生）和…一样`) *did* the economic boom of the 1920s, which also *lifted*(`=to raise sb/sth or be raised to a higher position or level`) American spirits. ② Both countries’ spirits *fell again* in the Great Depression that *followed*(`=to come after sth/sb else in time or order; to happen as a result of sth else`) the stockmarket crash of 1929. ③ After the lows of the 1970s, though, happiness in both *has been on the rise* ever since.

至于财富的作用，维多利亚时期经济稳步发展的同时，英国的幸福感也在稳步提升；20世纪20年代的经济繁荣也一样，它让英国人和美国人的精神都有所提振。1929年股市崩盘后的大萧条期间，两国的幸福感再次下降。不过，在经历了20世纪70年代的低谷之后，两国的幸福感一直在上升。

Overall, then, Dr Sgroi and Dr Proto *found* that happiness *does vary(`=to change or be different according to the situation`) with* GDP. ② But `主` the effect of health and life expectancy, which *does not have* the episodic(a.)(`=happening occasionally /and not at regular intervals`) quality of booms, busts(`=it loses so much money that it is forced to close down`) and armed conflict, `系` *is* larger, even `主` when the tendency of wealth *to improve* health `谓` *is taken into account*. ③ `主` A one-year increase in longevity(`=long life; the fact of lasting a long time`), for example, `谓` *has the same effect on* national happiness *as* 如同，像……一样 a 4.3% increase in GDP. ④ And, *as* the grand historical sweep(`=a movement over an area, for example in order to search for sth or attack sth`) *suggests*, 强调句 *it is* warfare(n.)(`=the activity of fighting a war, especially using particular weapons or methods`) *that* causes(v.) the biggest drops in happiness. ⑤ [On average] it *takes* a 30% increase in GDP *to raise happiness* by the amount that a year of war *causes it to fall*. ⑥ The upshot(`=the final result of a series of events`) *appears to be* that, while(`=(used at the beginning of a sentence 用于句首) although; despite the fact that... 虽然；尽管`) `主` *increasing* national income `系` *is important to* happiness, *it is not as important as* {(1)*ensuring* {the population *is* healthy} /and (2)*avoiding* conflict}.

总体而言，斯格罗伊和普罗图发现, 幸福感确实会随GDP的变化而改变。但是，健康和预期寿命对幸福感的影响更大（即使考虑到财富增加对健康的促进作用），这两者的影响不像繁荣、萧条和武装冲突那样是阶段性的。例如，寿命延长一年，对国民幸福感的影响, 与GDP增长4.3％的影响相同。而且，正如对漫长历史的探究所显示的那样，战争导致幸福感下降最多。平均而言，一年的战争所导致的幸福感降幅, 需要GDP增长30%才能拉平。结果似乎是，虽然增加国民收入对提升幸福感很重要，但确保人口健康和避免冲突的作用更大。

== 03 How to reveal a country’s sense, over the years, of its own well-being 纯净版

*DO* A COUNTRY’S inhabitants get happier *as* it gets richer? Most governments *seem to believe so*, *given* their relentless focus on *increasing GDP* year by year. `主` Reliable, long-term evidence linking wealth and happiness `谓` *is*, however, *lacking*. And measuring well-being *is itself fraught(a.) with* problems, since it *often relies on* surveys that *ask* participants *to assess* their own levels of happiness [subjectively].

Daniel Sgroi of the University of Warwick /and Eugenio Proto of the University of Glasgow, both in Britain, *think*, nevertheless, that {they *have* an answer}. *By examining* millions of books and newspaper articles *published* since 1820 in four countries (America, Britain, Germany and Italy), they *have developed* what they hope *is* an objective measure of each place’s historical happiness. And their answer *is* that {wealth *does bring* happiness, but some other things *bring* more of it}.

Previous research *has shown* that {people’s underlying levels of happiness *are reflected* in what they say or write}. Dr Sgroi and Dr Proto therefore *consulted* newspaper archives and Google Books, a collection of more than 8m titles that *constitute* around 6% of all books *physically published*. They *searched* these texts *for* words that *had been assigned* a psychological “valence” -- a value *representing* how emotionally positive or negative a word is -- while *controlling for* the changing meanings of words such as “gay” and “awful” (which once most commonly meant “to inspire awe”). The result *is* the National Valence Index, *published* this week in Nature Human Behaviour.

*Placed alongside* the timeline of history (*see* chart), _the valence indices_ for the places under study *show* {how _changes in national happiness_ *reflect* important events}. In Britain, for example, happiness *fell sharply* during the two world wars. It *began to rise again* after 1945, *peaked* in 1950, and then *fell gradually*, *including* through the so-called Swinging Sixties, until it *reached* a nadir around 1980.

America’s national happiness, too, *fell* during the world wars. It *also fell* in the 1860s, during and after the country’s civil war. The lowest point of all *came* in 1975, at the end of a long decline during the Vietnam war, with the fall of Saigon /and America’s humiliating defeat.

In Germany and Italy the first world war also *caused* dips in happiness. By contrast, during the second world war these countries both *got happier* as the war continued. Initially, that *might be put down to* their early successes, but this *can hardly explain* German happiness when the Red Army *was* at the gates of Berlin. The researchers *hypothesise* that {`主`  what *is being measured* here `系` *is* the result of propaganda and censorship, rather than honest opinion}. But they *cannot prove* this. Earlier in Italian history, though, there *was* a clear and explicable crash in happiness in 1848, with the failure of revolutions *intended to unite into* a single nation what *were* then half a dozen disparate states. Surprisingly, however, successful unification in the 1860s *also saw* a fall in happiness.

*As to* wealth, the steady progress of the Victorian period *matched* a steady increase in British happiness, as *did* the economic boom of the 1920s, which also *lifted* American spirits. Both countries’ spirits *fell again* in the Great Depression that *followed* the stockmarket crash of 1929. After the lows of the 1970s, though, happiness in both *has been on the rise* ever since.

Overall, then, Dr Sgroi and Dr Proto *found* that {happiness *does vary with* GDP}. But `主` the effect of health and life expectancy, which *does not have* the episodic quality of booms, busts and armed conflict, `系` *is* larger, even when `主` the tendency of wealth *to improve* health `谓` *is taken into account*. `主` A one-year increase in longevity, for example, `谓` *has the same effect on* national happiness *as* a 4.3% increase in GDP. And, *as* the grand historical sweep *suggests*, *it is* warfare *that* causes(v.) the biggest drops in happiness. [On average] it *takes* a 30% increase in GDP *to raise happiness* by the amount (that a year of war *causes it to fall*). The upshot *appears to be* that, while increasing national income *is* important to happiness, it is not as important as {*ensuring* {the population *is* healthy}} and {*avoiding* conflict}.
