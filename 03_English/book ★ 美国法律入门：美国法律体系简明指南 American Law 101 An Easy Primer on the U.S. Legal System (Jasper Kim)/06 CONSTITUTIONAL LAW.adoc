6.CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 宪法学

Constitutional law has some of the most controversial 有争议的 issues 问题 embedded in 根植于 it. Abortion 堕胎, affirmative action 平权法案, freedom of speech 言论自由, impeachment 弹劾, and the power to levy taxes 征税权 are just some examples of potentially polarizing 造成两极分化的 issues underlying constitutional law. The Constitution underlying constitutional law also provides the foundational framework 基本框架 for American law, which this chapter discusses. For these reasons, constitutional law is of critical importance 至关重要的 in understanding the basic tenets 基本原则 underlying American law.

[.my2]
宪法学中根植着一些极具争议性的问题。堕胎、平权法案、言论自由、弹劾以及征税权，这些只是宪法学领域中可能引发两极分化的部分典型问题。作为宪法学根基的美国宪法，同时也是美国法律体系的基本框架，本章将围绕这一点展开论述。基于这些原因，宪法学对于理解美国法律的基本原则而言至关重要。

=== The U.S. Constitution: A Brief History 美国宪法：简史

The U.S. Constitution was created in 1787. Originally, it was composed of 由……组成 seven main articles 条款. Later, in 1791, a Bill of Rights 权利法案, along with 17 subsequent 后续的 amendments 修正案, culminated into 最终形成 what we know as the U.S. Constitution today. In total, the Constitution is a fairly short written document 文献, containing approximately 大约 4,400 words. This is noteworthy 值得注意的, given its power and influence 影响力 today and throughout the nation’s history. (See Appendix 附录 B for the full written texts of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.)

[.my2]
美国宪法制定于1787年。最初，它由七个主要条款构成。1791年，《权利法案》以及之后的17条修正案陆续出台，最终形成了我们如今所熟知的美国宪法。整部宪法文本篇幅较短，约有4400个单词。考虑到它在当下以及美国整个历史进程中所拥有的影响力与权威性，这一点十分值得注意。（详见附录B中的美国宪法及《权利法案》全文）

The Constitution includes in it the following areas:

- Creates the structure and function 结构与职能 of the government
- Defines 界定 the relationship between individuals and the government
- Defines and clarifies 厘清 the powers of the government at the national and state level 联邦与州层面, as well as the interaction 互动关系 and power hierarchy 权力层级 between the two
- Prohibits 禁止 the government from taking certain actions

[.my2]
美国宪法涵盖以下几个方面的内容：
- 确立政府的结构与职能
- 界定公民与政府之间的关系
- 明确并厘清联邦与州层面政府的权力，以及两者之间的互动关系与权力层级
- 禁止政府实施特定行为

Constitutional law relates to 涉及 issues such as the following:

- What is the extent 界限 of individual freedoms 公民自由?
- What if one branch 分支 of government acts unconstitutionally 违宪地?
- How much government intrusion 干预 into individual lives is constitutional 符合宪法的?
- How do the courts determine 判定 whether a law is constitutional?

[.my2]
宪法学涉及的相关问题如下：
- 公民自由的界限在哪里？
- 若政府某一部门存在违宪行为该如何处置？
- 政府对公民生活的干预达到何种程度才符合宪法规定？
- 法院如何判定一项法律是否合宪？

=== Constitutional Interpretation 宪法解释

How do American courts determine whether a law is constitutional? Clearly, everyone is reading the same written text—the U.S. Constitution—but the critical 关键的 issue is not what is written, but how to interpret 解读 what was written in the Constitution. Two approaches 方法 exist relating to constitutional interpretation: (1) originalism 原旨主义 and (2) nonoriginalism 非原旨主义.

[.my2]
美国法院如何判定一项法律是否合宪？显然，所有人研读的都是同一部文本——美国宪法，但核心问题不在于宪法条文的字面内容，而在于如何解读这些条文。宪法解释主要存在两种方法：（1）原旨主义和（2）非原旨主义。

Under the originalism approach, the view is that the Constitution should be narrowly 狭义地 interpreted according to the intent 意图 of the original framers 制定者 of the Constitution (the Framers 制宪者) or the understanding of the Constitution’s provisions 条款 at the time of its adoption 通过 in the late 18th century. One rationale 理论依据 for this approach is to preserve 维护 the Constitution by not altering 改变 its interpretation to fit modern society’s current environment 现状.

[.my2]
原旨主义解释方法认为，应当依据宪法制定者（制宪者）的立法意图，或是18世纪末宪法通过时人们对宪法条款的理解，对宪法进行狭义解读。该方法的理论依据之一是，不通过修改宪法解读方式来迎合现代社会的现状，以此维护宪法的稳定性。

With the originalism approach, certain questions arise 产生. How do courts know what the Framers would think about a particular 特定的 issue in the 21st century (e.g., cyberissues 网络相关问题, drones 无人机)? Even assuming 假设 a court today can somehow step into the shoes of 设身处地揣摩 the original Framers, would this always be the most appropriate 合适的 approach to take, given how society has changed since the Constitution’s creation 制定? Originalists 原旨主义者 would likely counterargue 反驳 that the basic tenets underlying the Framers’ intent still provide the necessary foundational framework to resolve 解决 issues today, and that understanding historical events helps us to understand and shape 塑造 current and future events.

[.my2]
原旨主义解释方法也引发了一些问题。法院如何知晓制宪者会如何看待21世纪的特定问题（例如网络相关问题、无人机问题）？即便假设当代法院能够设身处地地揣摩制宪者的想法，但考虑到自宪法制定以来社会发生的巨变，这种解读方法是否始终是最合适的？原旨主义者可能会反驳称，制宪者立法意图所蕴含的基本原则，至今仍为解决各类问题提供着必要的基本框架，而且对历史事件的理解有助于我们认知并塑造当下与未来的发展走向。

The second constitutional interpretation approach is nonoriginalism 非原旨主义. Under the nonoriginalism approach, the view is that the courts must look beyond 跳出……的局限 the intent of the Constitutional Framers or the understanding of the Constitution’s provisions at the time of its adoption in the late 18th century. One rationale for this approach is to adopt 使适应 the Constitution to fit modern society’s current environment. In doing so 在此过程中, courts often look not only to the Constitution’s text, but also at history, past precedent cases 既往判例, dictum 裁判要旨 in relevant cases, as well as modern-day socioeconomic 社会经济的 and political realities 现实.

[.my2]
第二种宪法解释方法是非原旨主义。该方法认为，法院必须跳出制宪者立法意图，以及18世纪末宪法通过时人们对宪法条款理解的局限。其理论依据之一是，让宪法适应现代社会的发展现状。在运用这种方法时，法院通常不仅会参考宪法文本，还会结合历史背景、既往判例、相关案件中的裁判要旨，以及当代的社会经济和政治现实。

So far, the concepts 理念 underlying the Constitution and the courts’ ability to interpret the Constitution have been discussed. But to take a slight step back 换个角度思考, one issue that is examined 探讨, particularly 尤其 in U.S. law schools, is where in the Constitution the courts—specifically 具体而言, the U.S. Supreme Court 美国最高法院—were given the power of judicial review 司法审查 to determine whether a law or act 法案 is constitutional?

[.my2]
到目前为止，我们已经探讨了宪法的核心理念以及法院的宪法解释权。但换个角度思考，有一个问题在美国法学院中备受关注，那就是：美国宪法中究竟哪一部分赋予了法院——具体而言是美国最高法院——司法审查权，使其能够判定一项法律或法案是否合宪？

The short answer is that the U.S. Supreme Court was originally 原本 not directly given power of judicial review under the Constitution. Instead 相反, it was given this authority 权力 through a seminal 开创性的 and landmark 具有里程碑意义的 series of cases, first and foremost 首先 and most importantly, in a case known as _Marbury v. Madison_ (1803).

[.my2]
简而言之，美国最高法院原本并未通过宪法直接获得司法审查权。相反，这项权力是通过一系列具有开创性和里程碑意义的案件逐步确立的，其中首当其冲的便是1803年的“马伯里诉麦迪逊案”。

==== The Supreme Court’s Authority to Interpret the Constitution 最高法院的宪法解释权

Article III 第三条 of the Constitution relates to the judicial branch 司法分支, while Article I deals with 涉及 the legislative branch 立法分支 and Article II deals with the executive branch 行政分支. Article III states that “[t]he Judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in 赋予 one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts 下级法院 as the Congress may from time to time 不时地 ordain and establish 设立.” Thus 因此, Article III merely 仅仅 allows for the creation of one Supreme Court and “inferior Courts,” but whether the Supreme Court had the authority to be the final arbiter 最终裁决者 on issues of constitutionality 合宪性问题 was unclear 尚不明确 at the Constitution’s inception 制定之初.

[.my2]
美国宪法第三条涉及司法分支，第一条涉及立法分支，第二条涉及行政分支。第三条规定：“合众国的司法权应赋予一个最高法院，以及国会不时设立的下级法院。” 因此，第三条仅仅允许设立一个最高法院和若干下级法院，但在宪法制定之初，最高法院是否有权成为合宪性问题的最终裁决者这一点尚不明确。

Many people are surprised at how little attention Article III received from the Framers compared to Articles I and II. Article III grants 赋予 the Supreme Court original jurisdiction 初审管辖权 (i.e., jurisdiction 管辖权 in the first instance 一审, rather than through appeal 上诉) in cases related to foreign diplomats 外交官 or state parties 州政府作为诉讼一方, but not beyond the scope 范围 of these cases unless it is through a judicial appeal from a lower court.

[.my2]
许多人会感到惊讶，相较于宪法第一条和第二条，制宪者对第三条的关注程度要低得多。第三条赋予最高法院对涉及外国外交官或州政府作为诉讼一方的案件拥有初审管辖权（即拥有一审管辖权，而非通过上诉获得管辖权），但超出此类案件范围的，最高法院则需通过受理下级法院的上诉来获得管辖权。

In _Marbury v. Madison_, Marbury sued 起诉 Madison under the Judiciary Act 《司法条例》 of 1789, which was passed by 由……通过 the legislative branch. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction was expanded 扩大 beyond its original mandate 授权范围 by Congress to include the power to issue writs of mandamus 强制令 (a court order to a lower tribunal 下级法庭 to perform 执行 or not perform a designated act 特定行为) against federal officials 联邦官员. In its ruling 裁决, Chief Justice 首席大法官 Marshall of the Supreme Court ruled that the Supreme Court did not have the additional 额外的 legal authority under the Constitution—expressly 明确地 granted under the Judiciary Act of 1789—to compel 强制 the delivery 送达 of a specified commission 委任状 (the delivery of the commission by Madison, the new Secretary of State 国务卿, was a needed documentary process 程序性文件 for Marbury to become a Justice 法官). In an interesting plot twist 戏剧性转折, the previous 前任的 Secretary of State was Marshall, the current Supreme Court Chief Justice deciding the _Marbury v. Madison_ case.

[.my2]
在“马伯里诉麦迪逊案”中，马伯里依据立法分支通过的1789年《司法条例》对麦迪逊提起诉讼。根据该条例，国会将最高法院的初审管辖权扩大到了其原有授权范围之外，赋予最高法院向联邦官员签发强制令的权力（强制令是指法院要求下级法庭履行或停止履行特定行为的命令）。最高法院首席大法官马歇尔在裁决中指出，最高法院并未依据宪法获得《司法条例》所明确赋予的这项额外法定权力，无权强制麦迪逊送达特定委任状（麦迪逊作为新任国务卿，送达该委任状是马伯里获得法官职位所需的一项程序性文件）。这起案件中存在一个有趣的戏剧性转折：本案的主审法官、时任最高法院首席大法官的马歇尔，正是麦迪逊的前任国务卿。

What makes this case so noteworthy and precedent setting 开创先例的 is the rationale underlying why Chief Justice Marshall ruled that his court did not have proper 正当的 legal authority. In a sense 从某种意义上说, Chief Justice Marshall’s ruling represented 体现了 a very strategic 具有战略意义的 and deliberate 深思熟虑的 move 举措 to expand the power of his presiding court 任职的法院, the Supreme Court, in a unique 独特的 way. Specifically, Chief Justice Marshall argued 主张 that the Judiciary Act of 1789 had unconstitutionally expanded 违宪扩张 the powers of the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction beyond those limited powers expressly granted under Article III of the Constitution. Thus, according to the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in 1803, it did not have jurisdiction to hear 审理 the case.

[.my2]
这起案件之所以值得关注且具有开创先例的意义，关键在于首席大法官马歇尔作出最高法院不具备正当法定权力这一裁决的内在逻辑。从某种意义上说，马歇尔大法官的这一裁决是一项极具战略意义且经过深思熟虑的举措，以一种独特的方式扩大了他所任职的最高法院的权力。具体而言，马歇尔大法官主张，1789年《司法条例》将最高法院的初审管辖权扩张到了宪法第三条明确赋予的有限权力范围之外，这一行为本身是违宪的。因此，根据最高法院1803年的这项里程碑式裁决，最高法院无权审理此案。

The slight irony 讽刺之处 and strategy by Chief Justice Marshall in the case was that by declining 拒绝 a relatively 相对地 smaller amount of greater power (originally given under the Judiciary Act of 1789), the court gained far greater power through judicial review of all constitutional issues, by appointing itself 自行确立 as the final authority 权威机构 as to whether the Judiciary Act of 1789, or any other act, was constitutional or not. Thus, through the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling, it was established that Congress was prohibited from establishing any law contrary to 违背 the U.S. Constitution, and that it is the role of the Judicial branch to determine what is or is not constitutional. The Supreme Court did not expressly have such legal authority prior to 在……之前 _Marbury v. Madison_.

[.my2]
马歇尔大法官在这起案件中的策略带有一丝讽刺意味：他通过拒绝《司法条例》赋予的这项相对次要的额外权力，反而让最高法院通过对所有合宪性问题行使司法审查权，获得了更为强大的权力，并自行确立为判定1789年《司法条例》及其他任何法案是否合宪的最终权威机构。因此，通过最高法院的这项里程碑式裁决，两项重要原则得以确立：一是国会不得制定任何违背美国宪法的法律；二是判定法律是否合宪是司法分支的职责。而在“马伯里诉麦迪逊案”之前，最高法院并未明确拥有这项法定权力。


==== Supreme Court’s Authority to Review State Court Cases 最高法院对州法院案件的审查权

Article III of the Constitution, as stated earlier, originally did not expressly 明确地 grant 赋予 the Supreme Court the power of judicial review 司法审查权 over state courts, similar to how Article III did not expressly grant the power of review to the Supreme Court initially. However, over several cases within the early years of the court system, we now have a judiciary branch 司法分支 in which it is clear that the Supreme Court has firmly asserted 确立；主张 its power of review over state-level, nonfederal court cases, in addition to federal issues, as was established under _Marbury v. Madison_.

[.my2]
如前文所述，美国宪法第三条最初并未明确赋予最高法院对州法院的司法审查权，这与该条款起初未明确赋予最高法院审查权的情况如出一辙。然而，在法院体系建立初期的数个案件审理过程中，这一情况得以改变。如今的司法分支已经明确，最高法院除了有权审查联邦相关事务外，还对州层面的非联邦法院案件拥有不容置疑的审查权，这一权力的确立最早可追溯至“马伯里诉麦迪逊案”。

One of the first seminal 开创性的；具有重大意义的 cases relates to a case called _Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee_. In the case, the Supreme Court ruled that the interpretation 解读 of a treaty 条约 was relevant to 与……相关 a land dispute 土地纠纷 in the state of Virginia. The Supreme Court then remanded 发回重审 the case back to the Virginia Supreme Court. However, and provocatively 挑衅性地 (in today’s terms), the Virginia Supreme Court argued that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have the power of review over cases that began in state courts. Yet again, the U.S. Supreme Court was being tested in its early years, this time at the state level. Ultimately 最终, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded the controversy 争议 by ruling to reverse the state court’s decision on appeal 上诉审推翻州法院判决. In doing so, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal law issues (here, treaty law 条约法) initially considered at the state level were within the U.S. Supreme Court’s jurisdiction 管辖权. Thus, America’s highest court established its own supremacy over state courts 高于州法院的至上地位, as well as federal courts, regarding constitutional interpretation on civil law matters 民法事务.

[.my2]
最早的具有开创性的案件之一是“马丁诉亨特的承租人案”。在该案中，最高法院裁定，对某一条约的解读与弗吉尼亚州的一起土地纠纷密切相关，随后将案件发回弗吉尼亚州最高法院重审。但颇具挑衅意味的是（按如今的说法），弗吉尼亚州最高法院声称，美国最高法院无权审查由州法院启动的案件。就这样，美国最高法院在成立初期再次面临考验，而这一次的挑战来自州层面。最终，美国最高法院通过上诉审推翻州法院判决的裁定，终结了这场争议。在该裁定中，最高法院明确，州法院审理的联邦法律相关事务（本案中为条约法问题）属于美国最高法院的管辖范围。由此，美国最高法院确立了自身在民法事务的宪法解释方面，不仅高于联邦法院，更高于州法院的至上地位。

_Cohens v. Virginia_ expanded 拓展 the U.S. Supreme Court’s power of review one step further by establishing its supremacy over state courts regarding constitutional interpretation on criminal law matters 刑法事务宪法解释方面高于州法院的至上地位. In the case, the Cohens were prosecuted 起诉 by the state of Virginia for selling lottery tickets 彩票 from Washington, D.C. (a federal territory 联邦属地, not a U.S. state) in Virginia, violating 违反 Virginia state criminal law 刑法. State authorities 州当局 tried 审理 and convicted 定罪 the Cohens. The same state authorities, provocatively (in today’s terms) also declared that their decision was the final decision related to disputes involving states and the federal government. On appeal 上诉后, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld 维持 the convictions. In doing so, the U.S. Supreme Court asserted itself with full appellate power of review and jurisdiction over both civil and now criminal cases at the state court level 对州法院审理的民事和刑事案件拥有全面的上诉审查权与管辖权.

[.my2]
“科恩斯诉弗吉尼亚州案”进一步拓展了美国最高法院的审查权，确立了其在刑法事务宪法解释方面高于州法院的至上地位。在该案中，科恩斯父子因在弗吉尼亚州销售源自华盛顿哥伦比亚特区（联邦属地，非美国的州）的彩票，违反了弗吉尼亚州刑法，遭到该州起诉。州当局对科恩斯父子进行审理并作出了有罪判决。同样颇具挑衅意味的是（按如今的说法），该州当局还宣称，其判决是涉及州与联邦政府纠纷的终局性判决。上诉至联邦最高法院后，最高法院维持了原判。通过这一判决，美国最高法院确立了自身对州法院审理的民事和刑事案件拥有全面的上诉审查权与管辖权。

The Supreme Court’s widening 不断扩大的 jurisdiction was made possible because of the Supremacy Clause 至上条款 under Article VI, Section 2 of the Constitution: “The Constitution, and the Laws of the United States … shall be the supreme Law of the Land 全国最高法律, and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby 受其约束.” However, the Supremacy Clause does not expressly say whether the Constitution is supreme (a higher legal authority 更高法律权威) relative to the “law of the land” at the federal or state level. It also did not state whether the Supreme Court had the power of review acting as the final authority 终局权威 regarding whether a particular issues was or was not constitutional, which, as previously covered 如前文所述, began to be established with a series of landmark cases 里程碑式案件, including _Marbury v. Madison_.

[.my2]
最高法院管辖权的不断扩大，得益于宪法第六条第二款中的至上条款。该条款规定：“本宪法及依本宪法所制定之合众国法律……均为全国最高法律，各州法官均应受其约束。”不过，至上条款并未明确说明，相较于联邦或州层面的“全国法律”，宪法是否具有至上性（即更高的法律权威）；同时也未明确最高法院是否拥有审查权，能否作为判定特定事项是否合宪的终局权威。而如前文所述，这项权力是通过一系列里程碑式案件逐步确立的，其中就包括“马伯里诉麦迪逊案”。

What powers do states have today under the Constitution? State power is granted under general authority 一般权限, which is the case because the Constitution does not explicitly specify 明确规定 what powers the states have. Viewed another way 换个角度看, the states have the authority remaining outside the explicit (limited) enumerated powers 列举权力 granted to the federal government under the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment 第十修正案 in the Bill of Rights 权利法案 states: “The powers not delegated 委托；授予 to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited 禁止 by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively 分别地, or to the people.”

[.my2]
如今各州依据宪法拥有哪些权力？各州的权力源于一般权限，因为宪法并未明确规定各州具体拥有哪些权力。换个角度看，各州所拥有的权力，是宪法授予联邦政府的明确（有限）列举权力之外的剩余权力。《权利法案》中的第十修正案规定：“宪法未授予合众国、也未禁止各州行使的权力，由各州各自保留，或由人民保留。”

==== What Authority Does the Constitution Give to the Federal Government? 宪法赋予联邦政府哪些权限？

The federal government was founded on a government of limited authority 有限权限. Specifically 具体而言, the federal government only has express enumerated powers 明确列举权力 granted to it under the Constitution. From a big-picture purview 宏观视角来看, the states have independent constitutional status 独立宪法地位 and general police powers 一般治安权, while the federal government only has expressly enumerated powers 明确列举权力.

[.my2]
联邦政府是一个基于有限权限建立的政府。具体而言，联邦政府仅拥有宪法赋予的明确列举权力。从宏观视角来看，各州拥有独立宪法地位和一般治安权，而联邦政府仅拥有明确列举权力。

Other safeguards 保障措施 exist to ensure that the Constitution would not be violated 被违反, such as the system of checks and balances 制衡机制 and separation of powers 三权分立, whereby 借此 one branch of government has certain authority to ensure that other branches of the federal government are not abused 滥用职权 and are acting in conformity with 符合 the Constitution. Yet another safeguard against abuse of power by an overreaching government 越权政府 is through specific guarantees 具体保障 adopted in 1791, known as the Bill of Rights 权利法案.

[.my2]
宪法还设有其他保障措施以防止其被违反，例如制衡机制与三权分立制度。借助这两项制度，政府的某一分支拥有特定权限，能够确保联邦政府的其他分支不会滥用职权，且其行为符合宪法规定。此外，针对越权政府的权力滥用行为，还有另一项保障措施，即1791年通过的一系列具体保障条款，也就是我们熟知的权利法案。

==== Executive Powers under Article II of the Constitution 宪法第二条规定的行政权

Article II of the Constitution defines 界定 the powers of the executive branch 行政分支. In it, the U.S. President has specific powers, including, among other things:

- Acting as Commander in Chief of the armed forces 武装部队总司令
- Entering into treaties 缔结条约
- Appointing ambassadors 任命大使, judges, and executive officials 行政官员

[.my2]
宪法第二条界定了行政分支的权力。根据该条款，美国总统拥有多项具体权力，其中包括：
- 担任武装部队总司令
- 缔结条约
- 任命大使、法官及行政官员

The U.S. President’s powers may seem somewhat limited 有限的 on paper 理论上, especially given many people’s perception 认知 that the American president is the most powerful person in the world. However, the Constitution and subsequent 此后的 U.S. Supreme Court case law 判例法 suggests that the President has all the powers that would normally be associated with the office 与该职位相应的, even if these powers are not expressly enumerated under the Constitution. At the same time, the President’s powers, as part of the executive branch, are under a system of checks and balances 制衡机制 by the judicial and legislative branches 司法与立法分支. Specifically, the judicial branch could, for example, rule that an act by the President was unconstitutional 违宪的, and the legislative branch could enact impeachment proceedings 弹劾程序 against the President for an alleged violation 被指控的违反行为 of the President’s duties under the Constitution.

[.my2]
从理论上看，美国总统的权力似乎相对有限，尤其是在许多人都认为美国总统是全球最有权势之人的背景下。但宪法及此后美国最高法院的判例法表明，总统拥有所有与该职位相应的权力，即便这些权力并未在宪法中明确列举。与此同时，作为行政分支的核心，总统的权力也处于司法与立法分支的制衡机制约束之下。具体而言，例如司法分支可裁定总统的某一行为违宪，而立法分支则可针对总统被指控违反宪法规定职责的行为，启动弹劾程序。

=== Summary 小结

The U.S. Constitution represents the highest source of law 最高法律渊源 under American law. High-profile 备受瞩目的 and often controversial topics 争议性话题, such as abortion 堕胎, affirmative action 平权法案, equal protection 平等保护, and freedom of speech 言论自由, fall under the ambit of constitutional law 宪法学. The power of review by the Supreme Court was not expressly stated under the Constitution, but soon after the Constitution’s adoption 颁布, a series of landmark cases arose 出现, which clarified 厘清 and asserted the U.S. Supreme Court’s authority to be the final arbiter 终局裁决者 in cases relating to whether or not an act is constitutional.

[.my2]
美国宪法是美国法律体系中的最高法律渊源。堕胎、平权法案、平等保护以及言论自由等备受瞩目且往往具有争议性的话题，均属于宪法学的研究范畴。最高法院的审查权并未在宪法中明确规定，但在宪法颁布后不久，一系列里程碑式案件相继出现，这些案件厘清并确立了美国最高法院作为判定某一行为是否合宪的终局裁决者的权威。

6.CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

Constitutional law has some of the most controversial issues embedded in it. Abortion, affirmative action, freedom of speech, impeachment, and the power to levy taxes are just some examples of potentially polarizing issues underlying constitutional law. The Constitution underlying constitutional law also provides the foundational framework for American law, which this chapter discusses. For these reasons, constitutional law is of critical importance in understanding the basic tenets underlying American law.

---

=== The U.S. Constitution: A Brief History

The U.S. Constitution was created in 1787. Originally, it was composed of seven main articles. Later, in 1791, a Bill of Rights, along with 17 subsequent amendments, culminated into what we know as the U.S. Constitution today. In total, the Constitution is a fairly short written document, containing approximately 4,400 words. This is noteworthy, given its power and influence today and throughout the nation’s history. (See Appendix B for the full written texts of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.)

The Constitution includes in it the following areas:

- Creates the structure and function of the government
- Defines the relationship between individuals and the government
- Defines and clarifies the powers of the government at the national and state level, as well as the interaction and power hierarchy between the two
- Prohibits the government from taking certain actions

Constitutional law relates to issues such as the following:

- What is the extent of individual freedoms?
- What if one branch of government acts unconstitutionally?
- How much government intrusion into individual lives is constitutional?
- How do the courts determine whether a law is constitutional?

---

=== Constitutional Interpretation

How do American courts determine whether a law is constitutional? Clearly, everyone is reading the same written text—the U.S. Constitution—but the critical issue is not what is written, but how to interpret what was written in the Constitution. Two approaches exist relating to constitutional interpretation: (1) originalism and (2) nonoriginalism.

Under the originalism approach, the view is that the Constitution should be narrowly interpreted according to the intent of the original framers of the Constitution (the Framers) or the understanding of the Constitution’s provisions at the time of its adoption in the late 18th century. One rationale for this approach is to preserve the Constitution by not altering its interpretation to fit modern society’s current environment.

With the originalism approach, certain questions arise. How do courts know what the Framers would think about a particular issue in the 21st century (e.g., cyberissues, drones)? Even assuming a court today can somehow step into the shoes of the original Framers, would this always be the most appropriate approach to take, given how society has changed since the Constitution’s creation? Originalists would likely counterargue that the basic tenets underlying the Framers’ intent still provide the necessary foundational framework to resolve issues today, and that understanding historical events helps us to understand and shape current and future events.

The second constitutional interpretation approach is nonoriginalism. Under the nonoriginalism approach, the view is that the courts must look beyond the intent of the Constitutional Framers or the understanding of the Constitution’s provisions at the time of its adoption in the late 18th century. One rationale for this approach is to adopt the Constitution to fit modern society’s current environment. In doing so, courts often look not only to the Constitution’s text, but also at history, past precedent cases, dictum in relevant cases, as well as modern-day socioeconomic and political realities.

So far, the concepts underlying the Constitution and the courts’ ability to interpret the Constitution have been discussed. But to take a slight step back, one issue that is examined, particularly in U.S. law schools, is where in the Constitution the courts—specifically, the U.S. Supreme Court—were given the power of judicial review to determine whether a law or act is constitutional?

The short answer is that the U.S. Supreme Court was originally not directly given power of judicial review under the Constitution. Instead, it was given this authority through a seminal and landmark series of cases, first and foremost, in a case known as _Marbury v. Madison_ (1803).

---

==== The Supreme Court’s Authority to Interpret the Constitution

Article III of the Constitution relates to the judicial branch, while Article I deals with the legislative branch and Article II deals with the executive branch. Article III states that “[t]he Judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.” Thus, Article III merely allows for the creation of one Supreme Court and “inferior Courts,” but whether the Supreme Court had the authority to be the final arbiter on issues of constitutionality was unclear at the Constitution’s inception.

Many people are surprised at how little attention Article III received from the Framers compared to Articles I and II. Article III grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction (i.e., jurisdiction in the first instance, rather than through appeal) in cases related to foreign diplomats or state parties, but not beyond the scope of these cases unless it is through a judicial appeal from a lower court.

In _Marbury v. Madison_, Marbury sued Madison under the Judiciary Act of 1789, which was passed by the legislative branch. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction was expanded beyond its original mandate by Congress to include the power to issue writs of mandamus (a court order to a lower tribunal to perform or not perform a designated act) against federal officials. In its ruling, Chief Justice Marshall of the Supreme Court ruled that the Supreme Court did not have the additional legal authority under the Constitution—expressly granted under the Judiciary Act of 1789—to compel the delivery of a specified commission (the delivery of the commission by Madison, the new Secretary of State, was a needed documentary process for Marbury to become a Justice). In an interesting plot twist, the previous Secretary of State was Marshall, the current Supreme Court Chief Justice deciding the _Marbury v. Madison_ case.

What makes this case so noteworthy and precedent setting is the rationale underlying why Chief Justice Marshall ruled that his court did not have proper legal authority. In a sense, Chief Justice Marshall’s ruling represented a very strategic and deliberate move to expand the power of his presiding court, the Supreme Court, in a unique way. Specifically, Chief Justice Marshall argued that the Judiciary Act of 1789 had unconstitutionally expanded the powers of the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction beyond those limited powers expressly granted under Article III of the Constitution. Thus, according to the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in 1803, it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.

The slight irony and strategy by Chief Justice Marshall in the case was that by declining a relatively smaller amount of greater power (originally given under the Judiciary Act of 1789), the court gained far greater power through judicial review of all constitutional issues, by appointing itself as the final authority as to whether the Judiciary Act of 1789, or any other act, was constitutional or not. Thus, through the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling, it was established that Congress was prohibited from establishing any law contrary to the U.S. Constitution, and that it is the role of the Judicial branch to determine what is or is not constitutional. The Supreme Court did not expressly have such legal authority prior to _Marbury v. Madison_.

==== Supreme Court’s Authority to Review State Court Cases

Article III of the Constitution, as stated earlier, originally did not expressly grant the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over state courts, similar to how Article III did not expressly grant the power of review to the Supreme Court initially. However, over several cases within the early years of the court system, we now have a judiciary branch in which it is clear that the Supreme Court has firmly asserted its power of review over state-level, nonfederal court cases, in addition to federal issues, as was established under _Marbury v. Madison_.

One of the first seminal cases relates to a case called _Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee_. In the case, the Supreme Court ruled that the interpretation of a treaty was relevant to a land dispute in the state of Virginia. The Supreme Court then remanded the case back to the Virginia Supreme Court. However, and provocatively (in today’s terms), the Virginia Supreme Court argued that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have the power of review over cases that began in state courts. Yet again, the U.S. Supreme Court was being tested in its early years, this time at the state level. Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded the controversy by ruling to reverse the state court’s decision on appeal. In doing so, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal law issues (here, treaty law) initially considered at the state level were within the U.S. Supreme Court’s jurisdiction. Thus, America’s highest court established its own supremacy over state courts, as well as federal courts, regarding constitutional interpretation on civil law matters.

_Cohens v. Virginia_ expanded the U.S. Supreme Court’s power of review one step further by establishing its supremacy over state courts regarding constitutional interpretation on criminal law matters. In the case, the Cohens were prosecuted by the state of Virginia for selling lottery tickets from Washington, D.C. (a federal territory, not a U.S. state) in Virginia, violating Virginia state criminal law. State authorities tried and convicted the Cohens. The same state authorities, provocatively (in today’s terms) also declared that their decision was the final decision related to disputes involving states and the federal government. On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the convictions. In doing so, the U.S. Supreme Court asserted itself with full appellate power of review and jurisdiction over both civil and now criminal cases at the state court level.

The Supreme Court’s widening jurisdiction was made possible because of the Supremacy Clause under Article VI, Section 2 of the Constitution: “The Constitution, and the Laws of the United States … shall be the supreme Law of the Land, and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby.” However, the Supremacy Clause does not expressly say whether the Constitution is supreme (a higher legal authority) relative to the “law of the land” at the federal or state level. It also did not state whether the Supreme Court had the power of review acting as the final authority regarding whether a particular issues was or was not constitutional, which, as previously covered, began to be established with a series of landmark cases, including _Marbury v. Madison_.

What powers do states have today under the Constitution? State power is granted under general authority, which is the case because the Constitution does not explicitly specify what powers the states have. Viewed another way, the states have the authority remaining outside the explicit (limited) enumerated powers granted to the federal government under the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment in the Bill of Rights states: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

==== What Authority Does the Constitution Give to the Federal Government?

The federal government was founded on a government of limited authority. Specifically, the federal government only has express enumerated powers granted to it under the Constitution. From a big-picture purview, the states have independent constitutional status and general police powers, while the federal government only has expressly enumerated powers.

Other safeguards exist to ensure that the Constitution would not be violated, such as the system of checks and balances and separation of powers, whereby one branch of government has certain authority to ensure that other branches of the federal government are not abused and are acting in conformity with the Constitution. Yet another safeguard against abuse of power by an overreaching government is through specific guarantees adopted in 1791, known as the Bill of Rights.

==== Executive Powers under Article II of the Constitution

Article II of the Constitution defines the powers of the executive branch. In it, the U.S. President has specific powers, including, among other things:

- Acting as Commander in Chief of the armed forces
- Entering into treaties
- Appointing ambassadors, judges, and executive officials

The U.S. President’s powers may seem somewhat limited on paper, especially given many people’s perception that the American president is the most powerful person in the world. However, the Constitution and subsequent U.S. Supreme Court case law suggests that the President has all the powers that would normally be associated with the office, even if these powers are not expressly enumerated under the Constitution. At the same time, the President’s powers, as part of the executive branch, are under a system of checks and balances by the judicial and legislative branches. Specifically, the judicial branch could, for example, rule that an act by the President was unconstitutional, and the legislative branch could enact impeachment proceedings against the President for an alleged violation of the President’s duties under the Constitution.

=== Summary

The U.S. Constitution represents the highest source of law under American law. High-profile and often controversial topics, such as abortion, affirmative action, equal protection, and freedom of speech, fall under the ambit of constitutional law. The power of review by the Supreme Court was not expressly stated under the Constitution, but soon after the Constitution’s adoption, a series of landmark cases arose, which clarified and asserted the U.S. Supreme Court’s authority to be the final arbiter in cases relating to whether or not an act is constitutional.
