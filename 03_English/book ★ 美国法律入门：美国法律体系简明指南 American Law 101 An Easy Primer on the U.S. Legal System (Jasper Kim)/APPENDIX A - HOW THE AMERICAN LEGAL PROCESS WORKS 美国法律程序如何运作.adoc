APPENDIX A - HOW THE AMERICAN LEGAL PROCESS WORKS

==== How Courts Work: The Role and Structure of Courts

Law won’t work without independent 独立的 courts. That means courts that aren’t under the thumb of 受制于；被……操纵 the political powers-that-be 当权者；掌权者. An independent judge can assure 确保 that your case will be decided according to the law and the facts—not the vagaries 难以预测的变化；变幻莫测 of shifting 不断变化的 political currents 趋势；潮流.

[.my2]
没有独立的法院，法律便无法发挥作用。这意味着法院不应受制于政治当权者。独立的法官能够确保案件的判决依据是法律与事实，而非变幻莫测的政治风向。

We need courts to interpret 解释；阐释 and apply 适用 the law when parties dispute 发生纠纷. In that way, courts take law out of dry and dusty 尘封的；枯燥乏味的 law books, and make it part of the living fabric 结构；架构 of our lives. Courts apply the law to specific 具体的 controversies 争议；纠纷 brought before them. They resolve 解决 disputes between people, companies, and units of government.

[.my2]
当当事方发生纠纷时，我们需要法院来解释和适用法律。如此一来，法院便能将法律从尘封的法典中抽离出来，使其成为我们日常生活架构的一部分。法院会针对提交至其面前的具体争议适用法律，解决个人、企业与政府部门之间的纠纷。

Often, courts are called on to uphold 维护；支持 limitations 限制；约束 on the government. They protect against 防范；防止 abuses 滥用；妄用 by all branches 部门；分支 of government. They protect minorities 少数群体 of all types from the majority 多数群体, and protect the rights of people who can’t protect themselves. They also embody 体现；代表 notions 理念；观念 of equal treatment 平等待遇 and fair play 公平竞争；公平行事. The courts and the protections of the law are open to everybody.

[.my2]
法院常常需要承担维护对政府权力约束的职责，防范政府各部门滥用职权。法院保护各类少数群体免受多数群体的侵害，维护那些无力自我保护者的权利。法院还体现着平等待遇与公平行事的理念，法律的保护与法院的大门向所有人敞开。

In any state, there are not one but two distinct 截然不同的；独特的 court systems: state courts and federal 联邦的 courts. The vast majority of 绝大多数的 cases—over 95%—are handled by the state courts. The great bulk of 大部分的 legal business 法律事务—traffic offenses 交通违法行为, divorce 离婚, wills 遗嘱 and estates 遗产, buying and selling property 房产买卖—is handled by the state courts, because all these areas are governed 管辖；规范 primarily 主要地 by state laws.

[.my2]
在美国的任何一个州，都存在着两套截然不同的法院系统：州法院与联邦法院。绝大多数案件（超过95%）由州法院审理。大部分法律事务——包括交通违法行为、离婚、遗嘱与遗产、房产买卖等——均由州法院处理，因为这些领域主要由州法律管辖。

Basically, the courts of this country are divided into 划分为 three layers 层级:

1. Trial courts, where cases start
2. Intermediate 中级的 (appellate 上诉的) courts, where most appeals 上诉 are first heard
3. Courts of last resort 终审法院 (usually called supreme courts 最高法院), which hear further appeals and have final authority 最终管辖权 in the cases they hear

[.my2]
美国的法院体系大致分为三个层级：
1.  初审法院——案件的一审法院
2.  中级（上诉）法院——大多数上诉案件的一审上诉法院
3.  终审法院（通常称为最高法院）——审理进一步的上诉案件，并对其所审理的案件拥有最终管辖权

---

==== The Role of Judges

What does a judge do? Maybe it’s best to start with what he or she doesn’t do. Even though he or she works for the state, a judge is not a law enforcement officer 执法人员. A judge is not a prosecutor 检察官. Judges don’t arrest 逮捕 people or try to prove them guilty 有罪的.

[.my2]
法官的职责是什么？或许从明确法官不做什么入手会更为清晰。尽管法官为政府工作，但他们并非执法人员，也不是检察官。法官不会逮捕他人，也不会试图证明他人有罪。

Judges are like umpires 裁判员 in baseball or referees 裁判 in football or basketball. Their role is to see that 确保 the rules of court procedures 诉讼程序 are followed by both sides. Like the ump, they call ‘em as they see ‘em 如实作出判断；按实际情况评判, according to the facts and law—without regard to 不考虑；不顾及 which side is popular (no home field advantage 主场优势), without regard to who is “favored 受偏袒的”, without regard for what the spectators 观众 want, and without regard to whether the judge agrees with the law.

[.my2]
法官就如同棒球比赛的裁判员，或是足球、篮球比赛的裁判。他们的职责是确保诉讼程序的规则得到双方的遵守。和裁判员一样，法官会依据事实与法律如实作出判断——不会考虑哪一方更受欢迎（不存在主场优势），不会顾及谁是“受偏袒的一方”，不会理会观众的诉求，也不会在意自己是否认同相关法律条文。

==== The Role of Juries

A jury 陪审团 is a group of people summoned 传唤；召集 and sworn 宣誓 to decide on the facts at issue 争议中的 in a trial. The jury is composed of 由……组成 people who represent a cross-section 典型代表；缩影 of the community 社区；群体. The jury listens to the evidence 证据 during a trial, decides what facts the evidence has established 证实；确认, and draws inferences 作出推论；推断 from those facts to form the basis for their decision. The jury decides whether a defendant 被告 is “guilty” or “not guilty” in criminal cases, and “liable 负有责任的” or “not liable” in civil cases.

[.my2]
陪审团是一组经传唤并宣誓后，负责裁定庭审中争议事实的人员群体。陪审团成员代表着社会各阶层的典型缩影。在庭审过程中，陪审团听取证据，判定证据所证实的事实，并基于这些事实作出推论，以此作为裁决的依据。在刑事案件中，陪审团裁定被告“有罪”或“无罪”；在民事案件中，陪审团裁定被告“负有责任”或“无责任”。

When cases are tried before a jury, the judge still has a major role in determining 裁定 which evidence may be considered by the jury. The jury is the fact-finder 事实认定者, but it is left to “find” facts only from the evidence which is legally admissible 可采纳的. The judge instructs 指导；告知 the jury on the legal principles 法律原则 or rules that must be followed in weighing 权衡；考量 the facts. If the jury finds the accused 被告人 guilty or liable, it is up to the judge to sentence 判刑；判处 the defendant.

[.my2]
在陪审团参与审理的案件中，法官仍扮演着重要角色，负责裁定哪些证据可被陪审团采纳。陪审团是事实认定者，但只能基于法律上可采纳的证据来“认定”事实。法官会向陪审团阐明在权衡事实时必须遵循的法律原则或规则。若陪审团裁定被告人有罪或负有责任，则由法官负责对被告作出判决。

===== Grand Juries

A grand jury 大陪审团 is a group of people summoned to determine 判定 whether the facts and accusations 指控 presented by the prosecutor warrant 证明……正当；使……有理 an indictment 起诉书；刑事指控 and eventual 最终的 trial of the accused. It is called a grand jury because of the relative large amount of jurors 陪审员 impaneled 入选陪审团；组成陪审团 (traditionally 传统上 23) as compared with a petit jury 小陪审团 or trial jury 庭审陪审团.

[.my2]
大陪审团是一组经传唤的人员，负责裁定检察官所提交的事实与指控是否足以构成对被告人的刑事指控并启动最终庭审。它之所以被称为“大”陪审团，是因为相较于小陪审团（或称庭审陪审团），其入选的陪审员人数相对较多（传统上为23人）。

Grand juries exist in the federal system and in almost all states. However, in only about half the states do grand juries have to be used to bring charges 提起指控 for felonies 重罪. In the other states, they may or may not be used to bring charges for felonies—prosecutors have discretion 酌处权；自由裁量权 to use them or bring charges on their own 自行.

[.my2]
联邦法院系统与几乎所有州的法院系统都设有大陪审团。然而，仅有约半数的州规定，针对重罪提起指控必须经由大陪审团。在其他州，重罪指控的提起可由检察官自行决定是否启用大陪审团，检察官既可以借助大陪审团提起指控，也可以自行提起指控。

Grand juries also have a second role in many states: investigating 调查 public corruption 腐败 or undertaking 承担；执行 such tasks as monitoring 监督 conditions in the jail 监狱.

[.my2]
在许多州，大陪审团还承担着第二项职责：调查公职人员腐败问题，或是执行诸如监督监狱状况之类的任务。

===== Trial Juries

Trial juries are traditionally composed of 12 members whose verdict 裁决 is required to be unanimous 全体一致的. Less than unanimous verdicts have been held constitutionally 依据宪法 permissible 允许的 in state, but not federal, criminal proceedings 诉讼程序.

[.my2]
传统上，庭审陪审团由12名成员组成，其作出的裁决必须达成全体一致。在州法院的刑事诉讼程序中，非全体一致的裁决被认定为符合宪法规定，但联邦法院的刑事诉讼程序不允许出现这种情况。

==== Judicial Independence

Before the American Revolution 美国独立战争, courts in the colonies 殖民地 were seen as instruments 工具；手段 of oppression 压迫；压制. Juries could be locked up 关押；监禁 until they reached the “right” decision. Judges were seen as puppets 傀儡；木偶 of the king. In fact, the Declaration of Independence 美国《独立宣言》 criticized King George III for making “judges dependent upon 依赖于；取决于 his will alone for the tenure 任期 of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries 薪水；薪酬.”

[.my2]
在美国独立战争之前，殖民地的法院被视为压迫民众的工具。陪审团可能会被关押，直到作出“正确的”裁决。法官则被看作是国王的傀儡。事实上，美国《独立宣言》曾批评英王乔治三世，称其“使法官的任期、薪俸金额与支付完全取决于他个人的意志”。

This experience convinced 使确信；使信服 the founders 开国元勋 that Americans needed independent courts to be protected from unreasonable searches 搜查, rigged 操纵的；舞弊的 trials, and other examples of overreaching 越权的；过度的 government power. To guarantee 保障；确保 rights like freedom of speech 言论自由 and freedom of worship 宗教信仰自由, and make the rule of law 法治 a reality, the founders knew that judges had to be servants 公仆 of law and the Constitution 宪法, not the political bosses 政治头目, not the media 媒体, and not special interest groups 特殊利益集团. The Constitution protected judges from political and public pressure by:

- Specifying 明确规定 that they hold their office “during good behavior 品行良好期间”. This meant that their appointments 任命 are for life 终身的.
- Specifying that their salaries cannot be diminished 削减；降低 during their tenure. This prevents Congress 国会 from retaliating against 报复；报复性打击 judges by cutting their pay.
- Making the removal 罢免；撤职 process difficult (only on “impeachment 弹劾 for, and conviction of, treason 叛国罪, bribery 贿赂, or other high crimes and misdemeanors 轻罪”).

[.my2]
这一经历使开国元勋们确信，美国人需要独立的法院来保护自己免受无理搜查、操纵性审判以及其他政府越权行为的侵害。为了保障言论自由、宗教信仰自由等权利，让法治成为现实，开国元勋们深知，法官必须成为法律与宪法的公仆，而非政治头目、媒体或特殊利益集团的附庸。美国宪法通过以下方式保护法官免受政治与公众压力的影响：
- 明确规定法官“在品行良好期间”任职，这意味着法官的任命是终身制的。
- 明确规定法官的薪俸在任期内不得削减，这防止了国会通过降薪来报复法官。
- 设定严苛的法官罢免程序（仅在法官“因叛国罪、贿赂罪或其他重罪和轻罪被弹劾并定罪”时，方可被罢免）。

Throughout American history, the independence of the judiciary 司法机构 has protected individual liberties 个人自由 and prevented a tyranny 专制统治；暴政 of the majority. Examples include extending 扩大；拓展 voting rights 选举权, ending segregation 种族隔离, and protecting the average citizen from unwarranted 无正当理由的；未经授权的 government intrusion 干预；介入. Emerging democracies 新兴民主国家 look to our system of an independent judiciary as a model 典范；榜样. They are all too familiar with the “telephone justice 电话司法” of dictatorships 独裁政权, in which a judge adjourns 延期；休庭 court to wait for the call that tells him or her how to decide the case. Judicial independence assures that cases will be decided on their merits 案件的是非曲直. Decisions are based on what is right and just 公正的 under the law, not what is popular 受欢迎的；普遍的 at the moment.

[.my2]
纵观美国历史，司法独立一直保护着个人自由，防止了多数人的专制统治。相关例证包括扩大选举权、废除种族隔离制度，以及保护普通公民免受政府的无理干预。新兴民主国家将美国的司法独立制度视为典范。这些国家对独裁政权下的“电话司法”再熟悉不过——在这种制度下，法官会宣布休庭，等待那通告知其如何判决案件的电话。司法独立确保案件的判决依据是其本身的是非曲直，裁决的作出基于法律框架内的正当与公正，而非当下的流行观点。

==== Diagram of How a Case Moves Through the Courts

===== Civil and Criminal Cases

The law deals with two kinds of cases. Civil 民事的 cases involve conflicts 冲突 between people or institutions 机构 such as businesses. A civil case usually begins when a person or organization determines 认定 that a problem can’t be solved without the intervention 干预；介入 of the courts. In civil cases, one (or more) of these persons or organizations brings suit 提起诉讼 (i.e., files a complaint 提交起诉状 in court that begins a lawsuit).

[.my2]
法律处理两类案件。民事案件涉及个人与个人、个人与机构（如企业）之间的纠纷。当个人或组织认定某一问题必须经由法院干预才能解决时，民事案件通常便会启动。在民事案件中，相关个人或组织中的一方（或多方）会提起诉讼，也就是向法院提交起诉状，正式启动诉讼程序。

Criminal 刑事的 cases involve enforcing 执行；实施 public codes of behavior 行为准则 as embodied in 体现于 the laws, with the government prosecuting 起诉；指控 individuals or institutions. In a criminal case, the government brings charges 提起指控 against the person alleged to 被指控 have committed the crime 犯罪.

[.my2]
刑事案件涉及执行法律中所体现的公共行为准则，由政府对涉嫌犯罪的个人或机构提起诉讼。在刑事案件中，政府会对被指控实施犯罪行为的人提起指控。

What types of cases are civil? Divorce 离婚 and related lawsuits (child support 子女抚养费, custody 监护权, and the like 诸如此类) account for 占比；构成 a very large number of civil cases. Cases involving contracts 合同 are also frequent 常见的. Automobile collisions 碰撞 account for many tort 侵权行为 (personal injury 人身伤害) cases, another common kind of civil case. An auto collision gives rise to 引发 a civil case if one driver sues 起诉 the other, or if a passenger 乘客 in one of the cars sues either driver. An auto collision might also lead to a criminal case, if it involves allegations 指控 of a crime such as drunken driving 酒后驾驶 or leaving the scene of an accident 肇事逃逸.

[.my2]
哪些案件属于民事案件？离婚及相关诉讼（如子女抚养费、监护权等问题）在民事案件中占比极高。合同纠纷案件也十分常见。汽车碰撞事故会引发大量的侵权损害赔偿（人身伤害）案件，这是另一种常见的民事案件类型。如果事故中的一方司机起诉另一方司机，或是其中一辆车的乘客起诉任意一方司机，这起汽车碰撞事故就会引发民事案件。而如果事故涉及酒后驾驶、肇事逃逸等犯罪指控，那么这起事故也可能会引发刑事案件。

In many parts of the world, civil and criminal legal actions 诉讼行为 are combined into 合并为 one case, but in our country they are not. If there are serious civil and criminal aspects 方面 of an event, there will be two (or more) distinct 截然不同的 cases. An example would be a crime leading to a criminal trial 刑事审判 of the defendant, with the victims 受害人 filing a separate 单独的 civil suit against the defendant to recover damages 追偿损失 caused by the crime.

[.my2]
在世界上许多地区，民事与刑事诉讼会合并审理，但在美国并非如此。如果某一事件同时涉及严重的民事与刑事问题，那么就会产生两起（或更多）相互独立的案件。例如，一起犯罪事件会先引发针对被告的刑事审判，而受害人随后还可以单独对被告提起民事诉讼，追偿因该犯罪行为所遭受的损失。

===== Jurisdiction and Venue

The plaintiff’s 原告的 lawyer must decide where to file 提交 the case. A court has no authority 管辖权 to decide a case unless it has jurisdiction over 对……拥有管辖权 the person or property 财产 involved. To have jurisdiction, a court must have authority over the subject matter 标的；标的物 of the case and the court must be able to exercise control 行使管辖权 over the defendant, or the property involved must be located in the area under the court’s control. The extent 范围 of the court’s control over persons and property is set by law.

[.my2]
原告律师必须决定向哪个法院提交案件。法院只有对案件所涉的当事人或财产拥有管辖权，才有权审理该案件。要获得管辖权，法院必须对案件的标的拥有管辖权，并且能够对被告行使管辖权，或者案件所涉财产必须位于该法院的管辖区域内。法院对当事人和财产行使管辖权的范围由法律予以明确。

Certain actions 诉讼 are transitory 可异地审理的. They can be brought wherever the defendant may be found and served with 送达 a summons 传票, and where the jurisdiction 管辖法院 has sufficient 足够的 contact 关联 with one of the parties and the incident 事件 that gave rise to the suit. An example would be a lawsuit against a business—it would probably be sufficient to file suit in any county 县 in which the business has an operation 经营场所, and not necessary to file suit in the county where it is headquartered 总部所在地. Other actions—such as foreclosing on 取消……的赎回权 a piece of property—are local 属地管辖的. They can be brought only in the county where the subject of the suit 诉讼标的 is located.

[.my2]
部分诉讼属于可异地审理的类型。只要能够找到被告并向其送达传票，且受理法院与案件当事方之一以及引发诉讼的事件存在足够关联，这类诉讼就可以在相应法院提起。例如针对企业的诉讼——原告可以选择在该企业设有经营场所的任意一个县提起诉讼，不一定非要到企业总部所在地的县起诉。而另一些诉讼则属于属地管辖范畴，例如取消房产赎回权的诉讼，这类诉讼只能在诉讼标的所在地的县提起。

Venue 审判地 refers to the county or district 辖区 within a state or the U.S. where the lawsuit is to be tried 审理. The venue of a lawsuit is set by statute 成文法；法规, but it can sometimes be changed to another county or district. For example, if a case has received widespread 广泛的 pre-trial publicity 审前曝光, one of the parties may make a motion 提出动议 (request to the judge) for change of venue 变更审判地 in an effort to 旨在 secure 获得 jurors 陪审员 who haven’t already formed an opinion 形成看法 about the case. Venue also may be changed for the convenience 便利 of witnesses 证人.

[.my2]
审判地指的是州内或全美范围内，具体审理某一案件的县或辖区。案件的审判地由成文法规定，但有时也可以变更至其他县或辖区。例如，如果某一案件在审前受到了广泛曝光，其中一方当事人可以向法官提出变更审判地的动议，以期获得对案件尚未形成固有看法的陪审员。此外，为方便证人出庭作证，审判地也可以进行变更。

===== Pleadings

A lawsuit begins when the person bringing the suit files a complaint. This first step begins what is known as the pleadings 诉答文书 stage of the suit. Pleadings are certain formal 正式的 documents filed with the court that state the parties’ basic positions 主张.

[.my2]
当提起诉讼的一方提交起诉状时，诉讼程序便正式启动。这第一步开启了诉讼流程中的诉答阶段。诉答文书是指提交给法院的正式法律文件，用于阐明各方当事人的基本诉讼主张。

Common pre-trial pleadings include:

- Complaint (or petition 请愿书 or bill 诉状). Probably the most important pleading in a civil case, since by setting out 陈述 the plaintiff’s version of the facts and specifying 明确说明 the damages 损害赔偿金, it frames 界定 the issues of the case. It includes various counts 诉讼理由—that is, distinct statements of the plaintiff’s cause of action 诉由—highlighting the factual and legal basis 依据 of the suit.
- Answer 答辩状. This statement by the defendant usually explains why the plaintiff should not prevail 胜诉. It may also offer additional facts, or plead an excuse 提出抗辩理由.
- Reply 反驳状. Any party in the case may have to file a reply, which is an answer to new allegations 指控 raised in pleadings.
- Counterclaim 反诉状. The defendant may file a counterclaim, which asserts 主张 that the plaintiff has injured 损害 the defendant in some way, and should pay damages. (“You’re suing me? Well then, I’m suing you.”) It may be filed separately 单独地 or as part of the answer. If a counterclaim is filed, the plaintiff must be given the opportunity to respond 回应 by filing a reply.

[.my2]
常见的审前诉答文书包括：
- 起诉状（或称请愿书、诉状）：这或许是民事案件中最重要的诉答文书，它通过陈述原告主张的事实、明确索赔金额，界定案件的争议焦点。起诉状包含多项诉讼理由，也就是对原告诉由的逐条陈述，阐明了诉讼的事实与法律依据。
- 答辩状：这份由被告提交的文书通常会阐明原告不应胜诉的理由，也可能补充新的事实，或是提出抗辩理由。
- 反驳状：案件中的任何一方都可能需要提交反驳状，用于回应诉答文书中出现的新指控。
- 反诉状：被告可以提交反诉状，主张原告的行为对其造成了某种损害，应当承担赔偿责任（相当于“你起诉我？那我也起诉你”）。反诉状可单独提交，也可作为答辩状的一部分。一旦被告提交反诉状，原告就有权提交反驳状进行回应。

===== Motions

Motions 动议 are not pleadings but are requests for the judge to make a legal ruling 裁定. Some of the most common pre-trial motions include:

- Motion to Discover 证据开示动议. A motion by which one party seeks to 试图 gain information from the adverse party 对方当事人；对方.
- Motion to Dismiss 驳回起诉动议. This motion asks the court to dismiss the suit because the suit doesn’t have a legally sound 合法的；合理的 basis, even if all the facts alleged are proven true.
- Motion for Summary Judgment 简易判决动议 (sometimes called motion for summary disposition 即决判决动议). This motion asks the court for a judgment on the merits 案件的是非曲直 of the case before the trial. It is properly made where there is no dispute 争议 about the facts and only a question of law 法律问题 needs to be decided.

[.my2]
动议不属于诉答文书，而是当事人请求法官作出相关法律裁定的申请。最常见的审前动议包括：
- 证据开示动议：一方当事人通过该动议，向对方当事人调取相关信息。
- 驳回起诉动议：该动议请求法院驳回案件，理由是即便起诉状中指控的事实全部属实，该诉讼也缺乏合法依据。
- 简易判决动议（有时也称即决判决动议）：该动议请求法院在庭审前就对案件的是非曲直作出判决。当案件事实不存在争议，仅需法院对相关法律问题作出裁定时，提出该动议即为恰当。

===== Discovery

To begin preparing for trial 庭审, both sides engage in 参与；进行 discovery 证据开示. This is the formal process of exchanging information between the parties about the witnesses 证人和 evidence 证据 they’ll present at trial. Discovery enables the parties to know before the trial begins what evidence may be presented. It’s designed to 旨在 prevent “trial by ambush 突袭审判,” where one side doesn’t learn of the other side’s evidence or witnesses until the trial, when there’s no time to obtain answering 反驳的 evidence.

[.my2]
为筹备庭审，诉讼双方会开展证据开示程序。这是双方当事人之间的正式流程，用于交换各自将在庭审中出示的证人和证据相关信息。证据开示能让双方在庭审开始前，就知晓对方可能提交的证据。其设立目的是防止“突袭审判”——也就是一方当事人直到庭审时才得知对方的证据和证人信息，此时已没有时间准备反驳证据。

One of the most common methods of discovery is to take depositions 录取证词. A deposition is an out-of-court statement given under oath 经宣誓后作出的 made by any person involved in the case. It is to be used at trial or in preparation for trial. It may be in the form of a written transcript 书面笔录, a videotape 录像带, or both. In most states, either of the parties may take the deposition of the other party, or of any other witness. Both sides have the right to be present during oral 口头的 depositions.

[.my2]
录取证词是最常见的证据开示方式之一。证词是案件相关人员在法庭外经宣誓后作出的陈述，可用于庭审或庭审准备阶段。证词可以是书面笔录形式、录像形式，也可以两种形式兼具。在大多数州，双方当事人都有权向对方当事人或其他证人录取证词，并且在口头录取证词的过程中，双方均有权到场参与。

Depositions enable a party to know in advance 提前 what a witness will say at the trial. Depositions can also be taken to obtain the testimony 证言 of important witnesses who can’t appear during the trial. In that case, they’re read into evidence 作为证据宣读 at the trial. Often a witness’s deposition will be taken by the opposing side 对方当事人 and used to discredit 质疑；贬低 the witness’s testimony at trial if the trial testimony varies from 与……不符 the testimony taken during the deposition. (A lawyer might ask a witness at trial, “Are you lying now or were you lying then?”)

[.my2]
通过录取证词，一方当事人可以提前了解证人在庭审中的陈述内容。此外，对于无法出庭作证的重要证人，也可以通过录取证词的方式获取其证言，届时在庭审中将这份证词作为证据宣读即可。如果证人在庭审中的证言与其此前的证词内容不符，对方当事人往往会利用这份证词来质疑证人庭审证言的可信度（律师可能会在庭审中质问证人：“你是现在在撒谎，还是当时在撒谎？”）。

Usually depositions consist of 由……组成 an oral examination 询问, followed by cross-examination 交叉询问 by the opposing side. In addition to taking depositions, either party may submit 提交 written questions, called interrogatories 书面质询, to the other party and require that they be answered in writing under oath. If one party chooses to use an interrogatory, written questions are sent to the lawyer representing 代表 the other side, and that party has a period of time in which to answer.

[.my2]
通常情况下，录取证词的流程是先由一方进行口头询问，随后由对方进行交叉询问。除录取证词外，任何一方当事人都可以向对方提交书面质询问题，并要求对方经宣誓后以书面形式作答。如果一方决定采用书面质询方式，相关书面问题会送达对方当事人的代理律师，对方当事人需在规定期限内作出答复。

Other methods of discovery include subpoenaing 传唤 or requiring the other side to produce 提交 books, records 记录, or other documents for inspection 查验 (a subpoena 传票 is a written order issued by a court compelling 强制 a person to testify 作证 or produce certain physical evidence 实物证据 such as records); having the other side submit to 接受 a physical examination 体格检查; or asking that a document be submitted for examination to determine if it is genuine 真实的.

[.my2]
其他证据开示方式还包括：传唤或要求对方提交账簿、记录或其他文件以供查验（传票是法院签发的书面命令，强制相关人员出庭作证或提交账簿等特定实物证据）；要求对方接受体格检查；以及要求提交相关文件进行查验，以确认其真实性。

===== Opening Statements

The purpose of opening statements 开场陈述 by each side is to tell jurors something about the case they will be hearing. The opening statements must be confined to 局限于；限于 facts that will be proved by the evidence, and cannot be argumentative 争辩性的；议论性的.

[.my2]
双方当事人进行开场陈述的目的，是向陪审员介绍即将审理的案件相关情况。开场陈述的内容必须局限于有证据佐证的事实，不得包含争辩性内容。

The trial begins with the opening statement of the party with the burden of proof 举证责任. This is the party that brought the case to court—the government in a criminal prosecution 刑事诉讼 or the plaintiff in a civil case—and has to prove its case in order to prevail. The defense lawyer follows with his or her opening statement. In some states, the defense may reserve 保留 its opening statement until the end of the plaintiff’s or government’s case. Either lawyer may choose not to present 发表 an opening statement.

[.my2]
庭审由承担举证责任的一方率先进行开场陈述。承担举证责任的一方即为提起诉讼的一方——在刑事诉讼中是政府，在民事诉讼中是原告——该方需要举证证明己方的诉讼主张，才能胜诉。随后由辩护律师进行开场陈述。在部分州，辩方可以选择将开场陈述保留到原告方或政府方举证结束后再进行。双方律师均有权选择不发表开场陈述。

In a criminal trial, the burden of proof rests with 由……承担 the government, which must prove beyond a reasonable doubt 排除合理怀疑 that the defendant is guilty. The defendant does not need to prove his or her innocence 无罪—the burden is on the government. In a civil trial, the plaintiff has the burden of proof, and generally must prove liability 责任 by a preponderance of the evidence 优势证据原则 (i.e., the greater weight of the evidence). The degree of proof 证明标准 required in a civil case is far less stringent 严格的 than in a criminal case. Once again, the defendant does not have to prove that he or she is not liable.

[.my2]
在刑事审判中，举证责任由政府承担，政府必须排除合理怀疑，证明被告有罪。被告无需自证清白，举证责任完全在政府一方。在民事审判中，举证责任由原告承担，原告通常需要依据优势证据原则证明被告应当承担责任（即原告提供的证据证明力更强）。民事案件的证明标准远低于刑事案件。同样，在民事案件中，被告也无需证明自己无需承担责任。


===== Evidence

The heart of the case is the presentation of evidence 证据. There are two types of evidence—direct 直接的 and circumstantial 间接的；旁证的:

- Direct evidence usually is that which speaks for itself 不言而喻；不证自明: eyewitness 目击证人 accounts 陈述, a confession 供词；认罪, or a weapon 凶器.
- Circumstantial evidence usually is that which suggests a fact by implication 暗示；暗指 or inference 推论；推断: the appearance of the scene of a crime 犯罪现场, testimony 证言 that suggests a connection or link with a crime, physical evidence 物证 that suggests criminal activity.

[.my2]
案件的核心在于证据的提交。证据分为两类——直接证据与间接证据：
- 直接证据通常是不证自明的证据，包括目击证人的陈述、被告人的供词或凶器。
- 间接证据通常是通过暗示或推论来指向某一事实的证据，包括犯罪现场的状况、能够表明与犯罪存在关联的证言、能够证明犯罪行为发生的物证。

Both kinds of evidence are a part of most trials, with circumstantial evidence probably being used more often than direct. Either kind of evidence can be offered in oral 口头的 testimony of witnesses or physical exhibits 物证 exhibits, including fingerprints 指纹, test results 检测结果, and documents 文件. Neither kind of evidence is more valuable 有价值的 than the other.

[.my2]
这两类证据都会出现在大多数庭审中，间接证据的使用频率或许还高于直接证据。两类证据都可以通过证人的口头证言或实物证据的形式提交，实物证据包括指纹、检测结果和各类文件。两类证据的证明效力并无高低之分。

Strict rules govern 约束；规范 the kinds of evidence that may be admitted into 被采纳进入 a trial, and the presentation of evidence is governed by formal 正式的 rules.

[.my2]
关于哪些证据可以被庭审采纳，有着严格的规则约束，而证据的提交也需遵循正式的程序规则。

===== Closing Arguments

The lawyers’ closing arguments 结案陈词 or summations 总结陈述 discuss the evidence and properly drawn 合理作出的 inferences. The lawyers cannot talk about issues outside the case or about evidence that was not presented 提交. The judge usually indicates 表明；告知 to the lawyers before closing arguments begin which instructions 指示；指导 he or she intends to give the jury 陪审团. In their closing arguments the lawyers can comment on 评论 the jury instructions and relate them to 把……与……关联 the evidence.

[.my2]
律师的结案陈词（或称总结陈述）会围绕证据以及基于证据作出的合理推论展开。律师不得谈论与案件无关的事项，也不得提及未被提交庭审的证据。在结案陈词开始前，法官通常会告知律师其准备向陪审团作出的指导意见。律师在结案陈词中可以对这些指导意见进行评论，并将其与案件证据关联起来。

The lawyer for the plaintiff 原告 or government usually goes first. The lawyer sums up 总结 and comments on the evidence in the most favorable light 从最有利的角度 for his or her side, showing how it proved what he or she had to prove to prevail 胜诉 in the case. After that side has made its case, the defense 辩方 then presents its closing arguments. The defense lawyer usually answers statements made in the plaintiff’s or government’s argument, points out defects 缺陷；漏洞 in their case and sums up the facts favorable to 有利于 his or her client 当事人.

[.my2]
通常由原告方或政府方的律师率先进行结案陈词。律师会从对己方最有利的角度总结并评论证据，阐明这些证据如何证明了己方为胜诉而需要证明的事实。原告方或政府方陈述完毕后，辩方再进行结案陈词。辩方律师通常会针对原告方或政府方的陈词内容作出回应，指出其案件中的漏洞，并总结有利于己方当事人的事实。

Because the plaintiff or government has the burden of proof 举证责任, the lawyer for that side is then entitled to 有权 make a concluding argument, sometimes called a rebuttal 反驳；辩驳. This is a chance to respond to 回应 the defendant’s 被告的 points and make one final appeal 呼吁；诉求 to the jury. Occasionally 偶尔 the defense may choose not to make a closing statement. If so, the plaintiff or government loses the right to make a second argument.

[.my2]
由于原告方或政府方承担举证责任，该方律师有权进行最后一次陈词，这部分陈词有时被称为反驳陈词。这是律师回应被告方观点，并向陪审团作出最终诉求的机会。辩方偶尔也会选择不发表结案陈词，若出现这种情况，原告方或政府方便会丧失再次陈词的权利。

===== Verdict

After reaching a decision 裁决, the jury notifies 通知 the bailiff 法警, who notifies the judge 法官. All of the participants 参与者 reconvene 重新集合 in the courtroom 法庭 and the decision is announced. The announcement may be made by either the foreperson 陪审团团长 or the court clerk 书记员.

[.my2]
陪审团作出裁决后，会通知法警，再由法警通知法官。所有诉讼参与人回到法庭集合，随后由法官宣布裁决结果。裁决结果可由陪审团团长或法庭书记员宣读。

Possible verdicts 裁决 in criminal cases are “guilty 有罪” or “not guilty 无罪.” In a civil suit 民事诉讼, the jury will find for 作出有利于……的裁决 the plaintiff or the defendant. If the jury finds for the plaintiff, it will also usually set out 列明 the amount the defendant should pay the plaintiff for damages 损害赔偿金, often after a separate hearing 听证会 concerning damages. The jury will also make a decision on any counterclaims 反诉 that may be part of the case.

[.my2]
刑事案件的裁决结果只有两种可能——“有罪”或“无罪”。在民事诉讼中，陪审团会作出有利于原告或被告的裁决。如果陪审团作出有利于原告的裁决，通常还会在专门针对损害赔偿举行的听证会后，列明被告应当向原告支付的赔偿金额。对于案件中可能涉及的反诉，陪审团同样会作出相应裁决。

The lawyer for either party may ask that the jury be polled 逐个询问；投票表决, although the request usually comes from the losing party 败诉方. This means each juror 陪审员 will be asked if he or she agrees with the decision, as announced. This is to make sure that the verdict announced is the actual verdict of the jury. After the decision is read and accepted by the court, the jury is dismissed 解散, and the trial 庭审 is over.

[.my2]
任何一方当事人的律师都可以请求对陪审团成员进行逐个询问，不过这类请求通常来自败诉方。逐个询问意味着每位陪审员都会被问到是否认同宣读的裁决结果，此举是为了确保当庭宣布的裁决确实是陪审团的真实意见。裁决结果宣读完毕并经法院确认后，陪审团即被解散，庭审随之结束。

===== Judgment

The decision of the jury doesn’t take effect 生效 until the judge enters a judgment 作出判决 on the decision—that is, an order that it be filed in public records 公共记录.

[.my2]
陪审团的裁决并非即刻生效，必须由法官就该裁决作出判决——也就是发布一份将裁决结果录入公共记录的正式命令后，裁决才会生效。

In a civil suit, the judge may have the authority 权力 to increase or decrease the amount of damages awarded by the jury, or to make some other modifications 修改；调整 before entering judgment. In criminal cases, the judge generally has no authority to modify the verdict. In most jurisdictions 司法管辖区, he or she must accept it or reject it (e.g., by granting 批准 a motion in arrest of judgment 阻止判决生效的动议).

[.my2]
在民事诉讼中，法官在作出判决前，有权增加或减少陪审团裁定的赔偿金额，也可以作出其他方面的调整。而在刑事案件中，法官通常无权修改陪审团的裁决，在大多数司法管辖区，法官只能选择接受或驳回该裁决（例如通过批准阻止判决生效的动议来驳回裁决）。

If the defendant doesn’t pay the damages awarded to the plaintiff in a civil case, the plaintiff may ask for an execution of the judgment 强制执行判决. The clerk of the court in such a case will deliver the execution 执行令 to the sheriff 警长, commanding 命令 him to take and sell the property 财产 of the defendant and apply that money to 用于 the amount of the judgment.

[.my2]
如果在民事诉讼中，被告拒不支付陪审团裁定的赔偿金额，原告可以申请强制执行判决。法院书记员会将执行令送达给警长，命令警长扣押并变卖被告的财产，用变卖所得款项来偿付判决确定的赔偿金额。

===== Sentencing

If the defendant is convicted 被定罪 in a criminal case, the judge will set a date for sentencing 量刑. Before that time, a pre-sentence investigation 量刑前调查 will take place to help the judge determine the appropriate 适当的 sentence from the range of possible sentences set out in the statutes 成文法；法规. The pre-sentence investigation may consider the defendant’s prior criminal record 前科, family situation 家庭状况, health 健康状况, work record 工作履历, and any other relevant factor 相关因素.

[.my2]
如果刑事案件中的被告被定罪，法官会确定一个量刑日期。在量刑之前，法院会开展量刑前调查，协助法官在成文法规定的量刑范围内确定适当的刑罚。量刑前调查会考量被告的前科、家庭状况、健康情况、工作履历以及其他所有相关因素。

In most states and in the federal courts 联邦法院, only the judge determines the sentence to be imposed 判处；施加. (The main exception 例外 is that in most states juries impose sentence in cases where the death penalty 死刑 is a possibility.) The federal courts and some states have sentencing guidelines 量刑指南 to guide judges in determining appropriate sentences and to encourage uniformity 统一性.

[.my2]
在大多数州以及联邦法院，只有法官有权决定最终判处的刑罚（主要例外情况是：在大多数州，对于可能判处死刑的案件，量刑权由陪审团行使）。联邦法院和部分州制定了量刑指南，用于指导法官确定适当的刑罚，并促进量刑标准的统一性。

===== Appeals

A popular misconception 误解 is that cases are always appealed 上诉. Not often does a losing party have an automatic right of appeal 自动上诉权. There usually must be a legal basis 法律依据 for the appeal—an alleged 被指控的 material error 实质性错误 in the trial—not just the fact that the losing party didn’t like the verdict.

[.my2]
一种普遍的误解是所有案件都会被上诉。事实上，败诉方很少拥有自动上诉权。上诉通常必须具备合法依据——即主张庭审中存在实质性错误，而不能仅仅因为败诉方不认同裁决结果就提起上诉。

In a civil case, either party may appeal to a higher court 上级法院. In a criminal case, only the defendant has a right to an appeal in most states. (Some states give the prosecution 公诉机关 a limited right to appeal to determine certain points of law 法律问题. These appeals usually occur before the actual trial begins. Appeals by the prosecution after a verdict are not normally allowed because of the prohibition 禁止 in the U. S. Constitution 美国宪法 against double jeopardy 双重审判, or being tried twice for the same crime.)

[.my2]
在民事诉讼中，双方当事人均有权向上级法院提起上诉。而在刑事案件中，大多数州规定只有被告拥有上诉权（部分州赋予公诉机关有限的上诉权，用于就特定法律问题寻求裁决，这类上诉通常在正式庭审开始前提出。公诉机关在裁决作出后不得提起上诉，这是因为美国宪法禁止双重审判，即不得因同一罪行对被告人进行两次审判）。

Criminal defendants convicted in state courts have a further safeguard 保障措施. After using all of their rights of appeal on the state level 州层面, they may file a writ of habeas corpus 人身保护令 in the federal courts in an attempt to 试图 show that their federal constitutional rights 联邦宪法权利 were violated 被侵犯. The right of a federal review 联邦审查权 imposes the check 制约；监督 of the federal courts on abuses 滥用职权 that may occur in the state courts.

[.my2]
在州法院被定罪的刑事被告享有一项额外的保障措施。当被告用尽州层面的所有上诉权利后，仍可向联邦法院申请人身保护令，试图证明其联邦宪法权利受到了侵犯。联邦审查权的设立，旨在让联邦法院对州法院可能存在的滥用职权行为起到监督制约作用。

An appeal is not a retrial 重审 or a new trial of the case. The appeals courts 上诉法院 do not usually consider new witnesses 证人 or new evidence. Appeals in either civil or criminal cases are usually based on arguments that there were errors in the trial’s procedure 程序 or errors in the judge’s interpretation 解释 of the law.

[.my2]
上诉并非案件的重审或再审。上诉法院通常不会采信新的证人证言或新证据。无论是民事案件还是刑事案件的上诉，其依据通常都是主张庭审程序存在错误，或是法官对法律的解释存在偏差。


===== Appeal Procedure

The party appealing is called the appellant 上诉人, or sometimes the petitioner 请愿人；申请人. The other party is the appellee 被上诉人 or the respondent 被申请人. The appeal is instituted 提起；发起 with the filing of a notice of appeal 上诉通知书. This filing marks the beginning of the time period 期限 within which the appellant must file a brief 上诉状；案情摘要, a written argument containing that side’s view of the facts and the legal arguments upon which they rely 依据；依赖 in seeking a reversal 撤销；推翻 of the trial court 初审法院. The appellee then has a specified 规定的 time to file an answering brief 答辩状. The appellant may then file a second brief answering the appellee’s brief.

[.my2]
提起上诉的一方被称为上诉人，有时也叫请愿人。另一方则被称为被上诉人或被申请人。上诉程序的启动以提交上诉通知书为标志。提交上诉通知书后，便进入了上诉人提交上诉状的法定期限，上诉状是一份书面辩论文件，包含该方对案件事实的看法，以及其寻求撤销初审法院判决所依据的法律论据。随后，被上诉人需在规定期限内提交答辩状，上诉人还可以针对被上诉人的答辩状提交第二份答辩状。

Sometimes, appeals courts 上诉法院 make their decision only on the basis of 基于 the written briefs. Sometimes, they hear oral arguments 口头辩论 before deciding a case. Often the court will ask that the case be set for 安排 oral argument, or one of the parties will request oral argument. At oral argument, each side’s attorney 律师 is given a relatively brief 短暂的 opportunity 机会 to argue the case to the court, and to answer questions posed 提出 by the judges. In the U.S. Supreme Court 美国最高法院, for example, an hour is set for oral argument of most cases, which gives each side’s lawyers about half an hour to make their oral argument and answer questions. In the federal courts of appeals 联邦上诉法院, the attorneys are often allotted 分配 less time than that—10- or 15-minute arguments are common.

[.my2]
有时，上诉法院仅依据书面诉状作出裁决。有时，法院会在作出裁决前举行口头辩论。通常，法院会主动安排案件进行口头辩论，或者由一方当事人提出口头辩论的请求。在口头辩论环节，双方律师都有相对短暂的时间向法庭陈述案情，并回答法官提出的问题。例如，美国最高法院对大多数案件会安排一小时的口头辩论时间，这意味着双方律师各有约半小时的时间进行口头辩论和回答问题。而在联邦上诉法院，律师的辩论时间通常会更短，10到15分钟的辩论时长十分常见。

The appellate court determines 判定 whether errors occurred in applying the law at the lower court 下级法院 level. It generally will reverse 撤销 a trial court only for an error of law 法律适用错误. Not every error of law, however, is cause for a reversal. Some are harmless errors 无害错误 that did not prejudice 损害；侵害 the rights of the parties to a fair trial 公正审判. For example, in a criminal case a higher court 上级法院 may conclude 认定 that the trial judge gave a legally improper 不当的 instruction 指导意见 to the jury 陪审团, but if the mistake were minor 轻微的 and in the opinion of the appellate court had no bearing on 与……无关 the jury’s finding 裁决结果, the appellate court may hold it a harmless error and let a guilty verdict 有罪裁决 stand 维持有效. However, an error of law, such as admitting 采纳 improper evidence 不当证据, may be determined to be a harmful 有害的 and therefore reversible error 可撤销错误.

[.my2]
上诉法院会判定下级法院在适用法律的过程中是否存在错误。通常，上诉法院仅会因法律适用错误而撤销初审法院的判决。但并非所有的法律适用错误都足以导致判决被撤销，有些属于无害错误，并未损害当事人获得公正审判的权利。例如，在刑事案件中，上级法院可能认定初审法官向陪审团作出了法律上不当的指导意见，但如果该错误情节轻微，且上诉法院认为其对陪审团的裁决结果没有影响，那么上诉法院可能会将其认定为无害错误，并维持有罪裁决的效力。然而，诸如采纳不当证据这类法律适用错误，则可能被认定为有害错误，进而成为撤销原判的依据。

After a case is orally argued or otherwise presented for judgment 提交裁决, the appeals court judges will meet in conference 召开合议会议 to discuss the case. Appellate courts often issue 作出；发布 written decisions 书面裁决, particularly when the decision deals with a new interpretation 解释 of the law, establishes a new precedent 判例, etc. At the conference, one judge will be designated 指定 to write an opinion 判决书；意见书. The opinion may go through 经历 several drafts 草稿 before a majority of the court agrees with it. Judges disagreeing with the majority opinion 多数意见 may issue a dissenting opinion 异议意见书. Judges agreeing with the result of a majority decision but disagreeing with the majority’s reasoning 推理；论证过程 may file a concurring opinion 协同意见书. Occasionally 偶尔 the appeals court will simply issue an unsigned opinion 无署名意见书. These are called per curiam 由法庭全体出具的 (by the court).

[.my2]
案件经过口头辩论或以其他方式提交裁决后，上诉法院的法官会召开合议会议讨论案件。上诉法院通常会作出书面裁决，尤其是当裁决涉及对法律的新解释、确立新判例等情况时。合议会议上，会指定一名法官负责撰写判决书。这份判决书可能会经过多次修改，直至获得法庭多数法官的认同。持不同意见的法官可以出具异议意见书；而认同多数法官作出的裁决结果，但不认同其论证过程的法官，则可以提交协同意见书。有时，上诉法院也会直接出具无署名意见书，这类意见书被称为“由法庭全体出具的裁决”。

If the appeals court affirms 维持 the lower court’s judgment 判决, the case ends, unless the losing party 败诉方 appeals to a higher court. The lower court decision also stands if the appeals court simply dismisses 驳回 the appeal (usually for reasons of jurisdiction 管辖权).

[.my2]
如果上诉法院维持下级法院的判决，那么本案即告终结，除非败诉方向更高级别的法院提起上诉。若上诉法院直接驳回上诉（通常因管辖权问题），下级法院的判决同样会维持有效。

If the judgment is reversed, the appellate court will usually send the case back to a lower court (remand it 发回重审) and order the trial court to take further action 采取进一步措施. It may order that:

- A new trial 重审 be held.
- The trial court’s judgment be modified 修改 or corrected 更正.
- The trial court reconsider 重新考量 the facts, take additional evidence 补充证据, or consider the case in light of 依据；按照 a recent decision by the appellate court.

[.my2]
如果原判被撤销，上诉法院通常会将案件发回下级法院重审，并责令初审法院采取进一步措施。上诉法院可能会作出如下指令：
- 对案件进行重审
- 修改或更正初审法院的判决
- 初审法院重新考量案件事实、补充证据，或是依据上诉法院近期作出的相关裁决对本案进行审理

In a civil case 民事案件, an appeal doesn't ordinarily 通常 prevent the enforcement 执行 of the trial court's judgment. The winning party 胜诉方 in the trial court may order the judgment executed 强制执行判决. However, the appealing party 上诉方 can file an appeal or supersede as bond 上诉担保金. The filing of this bond will prevent, or stay 中止 further action on the judgment until the appeal is over by guaranteeing 保证 that the appealing party will pay or perform the judgment 履行判决义务 if it is not reversed on appeal.

[.my2]
在民事案件中，上诉通常不会阻碍初审法院判决的执行，初审法院的胜诉方可以申请强制执行判决。不过，上诉方可以缴纳上诉担保金。缴纳该担保金后，能够中止对原判的进一步执行程序，直至上诉程序终结，因为这份担保金可以保证：若上诉最终未能撤销原判，上诉方将履行判决确定的付款或相关义务。

APPENDIX A - HOW THE AMERICAN LEGAL PROCESS WORKS



==== How Courts Work: The Role and Structure of Courts

Law won’t work without independent courts. That means courts that aren’t under the thumb of the political powers-that-be. An independent judge can assure that your case will be decided according to the law and the facts—not the vagaries of shifting political currents.

We need courts to interpret and apply the law when parties dispute. In that way, courts take law out of dry and dusty law books, and make it part of the living fabric of our lives. Courts apply the law to specific controversies brought before them. They resolve disputes between people, companies, and units of government.

Often, courts are called on to uphold limitations on the government. They protect against abuses by all branches of government. They protect minorities of all types from the majority, and protect the rights of people who can’t protect themselves. They also embody notions of equal treatment and fair play. The courts and the protections of the law are open to everybody.

In any state, there are not one but two distinct court systems: state courts and federal courts. The vast majority of cases—over 95%—are handled by the state courts. The great bulk of legal business—traffic offenses, divorce, wills and estates, buying and selling property—is handled by the state courts, because all these areas are governed primarily by state laws.

Basically, the courts of this country are divided into three layers:

1. Trial courts, where cases start
2. Intermediate (appellate) courts, where most appeals are first heard
3. Courts of last resort (usually called supreme courts), which hear further appeals and have final authority in the cases they hear


---

==== The Role of Judges

What does a judge do? Maybe it’s best to start with what he or she doesn’t do. Even though he or she works for the state, a judge is not a law enforcement officer. A judge is not a prosecutor. Judges don’t arrest people or try to prove them guilty.

Judges are like umpires in baseball or referees in football or basketball. Their role is to see that the rules of court procedures are followed by both sides. Like the ump, they call ‘em as they see ‘em, according to the facts and law—without regard to which side is popular (no home field advantage), without regard to who is “favored,” without regard for what the spectators want, and without regard to whether the judge agrees with the law.

---

==== The Role of Juries

A jury is a group of people summoned and sworn to decide on the facts at issue in a trial. The jury is composed of people who represent a cross-section of the community. The jury listens to the evidence during a trial, decides what facts the evidence has established, and draws inferences from those facts to form the basis for their decision. The jury decides whether a defendant is “guilty” or “not guilty” in criminal cases, and “liable” or “not liable” in civil cases.

When cases are tried before a jury, the judge still has a major role in determining which evidence may be considered by the jury. The jury is the fact-finder, but it is left to “find” facts only from the evidence which is legally admissible. The judge instructs the jury on the legal principles or rules that must be followed in weighing the facts. If the jury finds the accused guilty or liable, it is up to the judge to sentence the defendant.

===== Grand Juries

A grand jury is a group of people summoned to determine whether the facts and accusations presented by the prosecutor warrant an indictment and eventual trial of the accused. It is called a grand jury because of the relative large amount of jurors impaneled (traditionally 23) as compared with a petit jury or trial jury.

Grand juries exist in the federal system and in almost all states. However, in only about half the states do grand juries have to be used to bring charges for felonies. In the other states, they may or may not be used to bring charges for felonies—prosecutors have discretion to use them or bring charges on their own.

Grand juries also have a second role in many states: investigating public corruption or undertaking such tasks as monitoring conditions in the jail.

===== Trial Juries

Trial juries are traditionally composed of 12 members whose verdict is required to be unanimous. Less than unanimous verdicts have been held constitutionally permissible in state, but not federal, criminal proceedings.

---

==== Judicial Independence

Before the American Revolution, courts in the colonies were seen as instruments of oppression. Juries could be locked up until they reached the “right” decision. Judges were seen as puppets of the king. In fact, the Declaration of Independence criticized King George III for making “judges dependent upon his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.”

This experience convinced the founders that Americans needed independent courts to be protected from unreasonable searches, rigged trials, and other examples of overreaching government power. To guarantee rights like freedom of speech and freedom of worship, and make the rule of law a reality, the founders knew that judges had to be servants of law and the Constitution, not the political bosses, not the media, and not special interest groups. The Constitution protected judges from political and public pressure by:

- Specifying that they hold their office “during good behavior.” This meant that their appointments are for life.
- Specifying that their salaries cannot be diminished during their tenure. This prevents Congress from retaliating against judges by cutting their pay.
- Making the removal process difficult (only on “impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors”).

Throughout American history, the independence of the judiciary has protected individual liberties and prevented a tyranny of the majority. Examples include extending voting rights, ending segregation, and protecting the average citizen from unwarranted government intrusion. Emerging democracies look to our system of an independent judiciary as a model. They are all too familiar with the “telephone justice” of dictatorships, in which a judge adjourns court to wait for the call that tells him or her how to decide the case. Judicial independence assures that cases will be decided on their merits. Decisions are based on what is right and just under the law, not what is popular at the moment.

==== Diagram of How a Case Moves Through the Courts


===== Civil and Criminal Cases

The law deals with two kinds of cases. Civil cases involve conflicts between people or institutions such as businesses. A civil case usually begins when a person or organization determines that a problem can’t be solved without the intervention of the courts. In civil cases, one (or more) of these persons or organizations brings suit (i.e., files a complaint in court that begins a lawsuit).

Criminal cases involve enforcing public codes of behavior as embodied in the laws, with the government prosecuting individuals or institutions. In a criminal case, the government brings charges against the person alleged to have committed the crime.

What types of cases are civil? Divorce and related lawsuits (child support, custody, and the like) account for a very large number of civil cases. Cases involving contracts are also frequent. Automobile collisions account for many tort (personal injury) cases, another common kind of civil case. An auto collision gives rise to a civil case if one driver sues the other, or if a passenger in one of the cars sues either driver. An auto collision might also lead to a criminal case, if it involves allegations of a crime such as drunken driving or leaving the scene of an accident.

In many parts of the world, civil and criminal legal actions are combined into one case, but in our country they are not. If there are serious civil and criminal aspects of an event, there will be two (or more) distinct cases. An example would be a crime leading to a criminal trial of the defendant, with the victims filing a separate civil suit against the defendant to recover damages caused by the crime.

===== Jurisdiction and Venue

The plaintiff’s lawyer must decide where to file the case. A court has no authority to decide a case unless it has jurisdiction over the person or property involved. To have jurisdiction, a court must have authority over the subject matter of the case and the court must be able to exercise control over the defendant, or the property involved must be located in the area under the court’s control. The extent of the court’s control over persons and property is set by law.

Certain actions are transitory. They can be brought wherever the defendant may be found and served with a summons, and where the jurisdiction has sufficient contact with one of the parties and the incident that gave rise to the suit. An example would be a lawsuit against a business—it would probably be sufficient to file suit in any county in which the business has an operation, and not necessary to file suit in the county where it is headquartered. Other actions—such as foreclosing on a piece of property—are local. They can be brought only in the county where the subject of the suit is located.

Venue refers to the county or district within a state or the U.S. where the lawsuit is to be tried. The venue of a lawsuit is set by statute, but it can sometimes be changed to another county or district. For example, if a case has received widespread pre-trial publicity, one of the parties may make a motion (request to the judge) for change of venue in an effort to secure jurors who haven’t already formed an opinion about the case. Venue also may be changed for the convenience of witnesses.

===== Pleadings

A lawsuit begins when the person bringing the suit files a complaint. This first step begins what is known as the pleadings stage of the suit. Pleadings are certain formal documents filed with the court that state the parties’ basic positions.

Common pre-trial pleadings include:

- Complaint (or petition or bill). Probably the most important pleading in a civil case, since by setting out the plaintiff’s version of the facts and specifying the damages, it frames the issues of the case. It includes various counts—that is, distinct statements of the plaintiff’s cause of action—highlighting the factual and legal basis of the suit.
- Answer. This statement by the defendant usually explains why the plaintiff should not prevail. It may also offer additional facts, or plead an excuse.
- Reply. Any party in the case may have to file a reply, which is an answer to new allegations raised in pleadings.
- Counterclaim. The defendant may file a counterclaim, which asserts that the plaintiff has injured the defendant in some way, and should pay damages. (“You’re suing me? Well then, I’m suing you.”) It may be filed separately or as part of the answer. If a counterclaim is filed, the plaintiff must be given the opportunity to respond by filing a reply.

===== Motions

Motions are not pleadings but are requests for the judge to make a legal ruling. Some of the most common pre-trial motions include:

- Motion to Discover. A motion by which one party seeks to gain information from the adverse party.
- Motion to Dismiss. This motion asks the court to dismiss the suit because the suit doesn’t have a legally sound basis, even if all the facts alleged are proven true.
- Motion for Summary Judgment (sometimes called motion for summary disposition). This motion asks the court for a judgment on the merits of the case before the trial. It is properly made where there is no dispute about the facts and only a question of law needs to be decided.

===== Discovery

To begin preparing for trial, both sides engage in discovery. This is the formal process of exchanging information between the parties about the witnesses and evidence they’ll present at trial. Discovery enables the parties to know before the trial begins what evidence may be presented. It’s designed to prevent “trial by ambush,” where one side doesn’t learn of the other side’s evidence or witnesses until the trial, when there’s no time to obtain answering evidence.

One of the most common methods of discovery is to take depositions. A deposition is an out-of-court statement given under oath by any person involved in the case. It is to be used at trial or in preparation for trial. It may be in the form of a written transcript, a videotape, or both. In most states, either of the parties may take the deposition of the other party, or of any other witness. Both sides have the right to be present during oral depositions.

Depositions enable a party to know in advance what a witness will say at the trial. Depositions can also be taken to obtain the testimony of important witnesses who can’t appear during the trial. In that case, they’re read into evidence at the trial. Often a witness’s deposition will be taken by the opposing side and used to discredit the witness’s testimony at trial if the trial testimony varies from the testimony taken during the deposition. (A lawyer might ask a witness at trial, “Are you lying now or were you lying then?”)

Usually depositions consist of an oral examination, followed by cross-examination by the opposing side. In addition to taking depositions, either party may submit written questions, called interrogatories, to the other party and require that they be answered in writing under oath. If one party chooses to use an interrogatory, written questions are sent to the lawyer representing the other side, and that party has a period of time in which to answer.

Other methods of discovery include subpoenaing or requiring the other side to produce books, records, or other documents for inspection (a subpoena is a written order issued by a court compelling a person to testify or produce certain physical evidence such as records); having the other side submit to a physical examination; or asking that a document be submitted for examination to determine if it is genuine.

===== Opening Statements

The purpose of opening statements by each side is to tell jurors something about the case they will be hearing. The opening statements must be confined to facts that will be proved by the evidence, and cannot be argumentative.

The trial begins with the opening statement of the party with the burden of proof. This is the party that brought the case to court—the government in a criminal prosecution or the plaintiff in a civil case—and has to prove its case in order to prevail. The defense lawyer follows with his or her opening statement. In some states, the defense may reserve its opening statement until the end of the plaintiff’s or government’s case. Either lawyer may choose not to present an opening statement.

In a criminal trial, the burden of proof rests with the government, which must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. The defendant does not need to prove his or her innocence—the burden is on the government. In a civil trial, the plaintiff has the burden of proof, and generally must prove liability by a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., the greater weight of the evidence). The degree of proof required in a civil case is far less stringent than in a criminal case. Once again, the defendant does not have to prove that he or she is not liable.

===== Evidence

The heart of the case is the presentation of evidence. There are two types of evidence—direct and circumstantial:

- Direct evidence usually is that which speaks for itself: eyewitness accounts, a confession, or a weapon.
- Circumstantial evidence usually is that which suggests a fact by implication or inference: the appearance of the scene of a crime, testimony that suggests a connection or link with a crime, physical evidence that suggests criminal activity.

Both kinds of evidence are a part of most trials, with circumstantial evidence probably being used more often than direct. Either kind of evidence can be offered in oral testimony of witnesses or physical exhibits, including fingerprints, test results, and documents. Neither kind of evidence is more valuable than the other.

Strict rules govern the kinds of evidence that may be admitted into a trial, and the presentation of evidence is governed by formal rules.

===== Closing Arguments

The lawyers’ closing arguments or summations discuss the evidence and properly drawn inferences. The lawyers cannot talk about issues outside the case or about evidence that was not presented. The judge usually indicates to the lawyers before closing arguments begin which instructions he or she intends to give the jury. In their closing arguments the lawyers can comment on the jury instructions and relate them to the evidence.

The lawyer for the plaintiff or government usually goes first. The lawyer sums up and comments on the evidence in the most favorable light for his or her side, showing how it proved what he or she had to prove to prevail in the case. After that side has made its case, the defense then presents its closing arguments. The defense lawyer usually answers statements made in the plaintiff’s or government’s argument, points out defects in their case and sums up the facts favorable to his or her client.

Because the plaintiff or government has the burden of proof, the lawyer for that side is then entitled to make a concluding argument, sometimes called a rebuttal. This is a chance to respond to the defendant’s points and make one final appeal to the jury. Occasionally the defense may choose not to make a closing statement. If so, the plaintiff or government loses the right to make a second argument.

===== Verdict

After reaching a decision, the jury notifies the bailiff, who notifies the judge. All of the participants reconvene in the courtroom and the decision is announced. The announcement may be made by either the foreperson or the court clerk.

Possible verdicts in criminal cases are “guilty” or “not guilty.” In a civil suit, the jury will find for the plaintiff or the defendant. If the jury finds for the plaintiff, it will also usually set out the amount the defendant should pay the plaintiff for damages, often after a separate hearing concerning damages. The jury will also make a decision on any counterclaims that may be part of the case.

The lawyer for either party may ask that the jury be polled, although the request usually comes from the losing party. This means each juror will be asked if he or she agrees with the decision, as announced. This is to make sure that the verdict announced is the actual verdict of the jury. After the decision is read and accepted by the court, the jury is dismissed, and the trial is over.

===== Judgment

The decision of the jury doesn’t take effect until the judge enters a judgment on the decision—that is, an order that it be filed in public records.

In a civil suit, the judge may have the authority to increase or decrease the amount of damages awarded by the jury, or to make some other modifications before entering judgment. In criminal cases, the judge generally has no authority to modify the verdict. In most jurisdictions, he or she must accept it or reject it (e.g., by granting a motion in arrest of judgment).

If the defendant doesn’t pay the damages awarded to the plaintiff in a civil case, the plaintiff may ask for an execution of the judgment. The clerk of the court in such a case will deliver the execution to the sheriff, commanding him to take and sell the property of the defendant and apply that money to the amount of the judgment.

===== Sentencing

If the defendant is convicted in a criminal case, the judge will set a date for sentencing. Before that time, a pre-sentence investigation will take place to help the judge determine the appropriate sentence from the range of possible sentences set out in the statutes. The pre-sentence investigation may consider the defendant’s prior criminal record, family situation, health, work record, and any other relevant factor.

In most states and in the federal courts, only the judge determines the sentence to be imposed. (The main exception is that in most states juries impose sentence in cases where the death penalty is a possibility.) The federal courts and some states have sentencing guidelines to guide judges in determining appropriate sentences and to encourage uniformity.

===== Appeals

A popular misconception is that cases are always appealed. Not often does a losing party have an automatic right of appeal. There usually must be a legal basis for the appeal—an alleged material error in the trial—not just the fact that the losing party didn’t like the verdict.

In a civil case, either party may appeal to a higher court. In a criminal case, only the defendant has a right to an appeal in most states. (Some states give the prosecution a limited right to appeal to determine certain points of law. These appeals usually occur before the actual trial begins. Appeals by the prosecution after a verdict are not normally allowed because of the prohibition in the U. S. Constitution against double jeopardy, or being tried twice for the same crime.)

Criminal defendants convicted in state courts have a further safeguard. After using all of their rights of appeal on the state level, they may file a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts in an attempt to show that their federal constitutional rights were violated. The right of a federal review imposes the check of the federal courts on abuses that may occur in the state courts.

An appeal is not a retrial or a new trial of the case. The appeals courts do not usually consider new witnesses or new evidence. Appeals in either civil or criminal cases are usually based on arguments that there were errors in the trial’s procedure or errors in the judge’s interpretation of the law.

===== Appeal Procedure

The party appealing is called the appellant, or sometimes the petitioner. The other party is the appellee or the respondent. The appeal is instituted with the filing of a notice of appeal. This filing marks the beginning of the time period within which the appellant must file a brief, a written argument containing that side’s view of the facts and the legal arguments upon which they rely in seeking a reversal of the trial court. The appellee then has a specified time to file an answering brief. The appellant may then file a second brief answering the appellee’s brief.

Sometimes, appeals courts make their decision only on the basis of the written briefs. Sometimes, they hear oral arguments before deciding a case. Often the court will ask that the case be set for oral argument, or one of the parties will request oral argument. At oral argument, each side’s attorney is given a relatively brief opportunity to argue the case to the court, and to answer questions posed by the judges. In the U.S. Supreme Court, for example, an hour is set for oral argument of most cases, which gives each side’s lawyers about half an hour to make their oral argument and answer questions. In the federal courts of appeals, the attorneys are often allotted less time than that—10- or 15-minute arguments are common.

The appellate court determines whether errors occurred in applying the law at the lower court level. It generally will reverse a trial court only for an error of law. Not every error of law, however, is cause for a reversal. Some are harmless errors that did not prejudice the rights of the parties to a fair trial. For example, in a criminal case a higher court may conclude that the trial judge gave a legally improper instruction to the jury, but if the mistake were minor and in the opinion of the appellate court had no bearing on the jury’s finding, the appellate court may hold it a harmless error and let a guilty verdict stand. However, an error of law, such as admitting improper evidence, may be determined to be a harmful and therefore reversible error.

After a case is orally argued or otherwise presented for judgment, the appeals court judges will meet in conference to discuss the case. Appellate courts often issue written decisions, particularly when the decision deals with a new interpretation of the law, establishes a new precedent, etc. At the conference, one judge will be designated to write an opinion. The opinion may go through several drafts before a majority of the court agrees with it. Judges disagreeing with the majority opinion may issue a dissenting opinion. Judges agreeing with the result of a majority decision but disagreeing with the majority’s reasoning may file a concurring opinion. Occasionally the appeals court will simply issue an unsigned opinion. These are called per curiam (by the court).

If the appeals court affirms the lower court’s judgment, the case ends, unless the losing party appeals to a higher court. The lower court decision also stands if the appeals court simply dismisses the appeal (usually for reasons of jurisdiction).

If the judgment is reversed, the appellate court will usually send the case back to a lower court (remand it) and order the trial court to take further action. It may order that:

- A new trial be held.
- The trial court’s judgment be modified or corrected.
- The trial court reconsider the facts, take additional evidence, or consider the case in light of a recent decision by the appellate court.

In a civil case, an appeal doesn't ordinarily prevent the enforcement of the trial court's judgment. The winning party in the trial court may order the judgment executed. However, the appealing party can file an appeal or supersede as bond. The filing of this bond will prevent, or stay, further action on the judgment until the appeal is over by guaranteeing that the appealing party will pay or perform the judgment if it is not reversed on appeal.
