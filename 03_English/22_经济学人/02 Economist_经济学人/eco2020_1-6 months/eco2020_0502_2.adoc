== 102. Flowerbeds of enterprise

(eco 2020-5-2 / Business / Chinese entrepreneurs: Flowerbeds of enterprise )

Private companies *have put down* strong roots in China

The pandemic and a more assertive Communist Party *are testing* their resilience

Apr 30th 2020 | HANGZHOU, SHANGHAI AND XIAMEN


`主` TO SAY THAT China’s economy has been hurt by covid-19 `系` is `宾` *putting it mildly*. `主` The 6.8% year-on-year fall in GDP in the first quarter `谓` *ended* a 28-year stretch of continuous, mostly rapid growth. The Communist Party, which *derives(v.) legitimacy from* rising living standards, *is keen*(a.) to put the slump behind it. President Xi Jinping *is reversing* a harsh lockdown and *propping up* state firms. But the world’s second-biggest economy *will not heal* by Mr Xi’s fiat alone.

For a collectivist state, China *is remarkably reliant(a.) on* private enterprise. *As* it *ages*(v.), and its economy *shifts from* manufacturing for export *to* domestic services, the entrepreneurial class *should grow* in stature. Right now, though, the corona-crisis and, under Mr Xi, a more hands-on, inward-looking regime *are testing* private-sector resilience *like never before*.

The People’s Republic *recognised* its first private business in 1980, when a 19-year-old street hawker(n.) named Zhang Huamei *registered* her stall selling buttons and toys in the port city of Wenzhou. Since then the party *has developed* its own form of “economic gardening” -- the notion, *popularised in America* in the 1980s, that grassroots entrepreneurs *drive*(v.) growth. It *told* business folk *what not to do* -- certain industries, such as tobacco, *were* out of bounds -- but otherwise *let them grow unimpeded*. *As* Jonathan Woetzel of McKinsey, a consultancy, *puts it*, China’s garden *has had more in common with* the deliberate wilderness of an English one *than* with manicured(a.) French lawns.

Horticultural(a.) miracle

This approach *has let* entrepreneurship *put down deep roots* in China over the past 40 years. By 2017 budding(a.) business owners *were registering* close to 6m firms a year -- or more than 15,000 a day -- nearly three times the figure in 2010. Private firms *contribute* three-fifths of GDP and four-fifths of urban employment. Private wealth *funds*(v.) 70% of investment. Wenzhou’s party bosses today *proudly proclaim that* 99% of its businesses *are privately owned* and one in five locals *has founded* a company.

Chinese internet startups *are* a case in point. IT Juzi, a research firm, *reckons that* between 2015 and 2018 some $1.3trn in venture capital *flowed into* such firms. More than 130,000 *have been created* since 2001. Many ventures *fail*. The Asian Development Bank *reckons that* the average life expectancy of all small firms in China *is* less than four years, half that in America. Research by Renmin University in Beijing in 2016 *found that* only `主` 2% of graduates who *began* a first business `谓` *succeeded*. Yet the same survey *found that* four in five *still wanted to try* their hand at starting one.

This zeal *may stem from* a belief that anyone can make it big. Chen Long, provost of the Hupan School of Entrepreneurship in Hangzhou, a startup-rich city in Zhejiang province, *puts* his compatriots’ entrepreneurial vim(n.) *down to* “countless examples of success”, which *give “a sense that* you can change your own fate”. In Fujian, *a hive of business activity* in pre-Mao days, people *asked about* the secret of business success *recite* a folk song: “Three parts of your life *the heavens determine*(v.), the other seven *you can* if you’re hard-working.”

`主` Tales like that of Jack Ma, who *twice failed to get into university* and *started* Alibaba, an e-commerce titan, in a cramped Hangzhou apartment, `谓` *enrapture*(v.) millions. Biographies of rock star founders(n.) like him or his namesake(n.) Pony Ma of Tencent, an online games-to-payments giant, *fly off the shelves*. Their pronouncements(n.) *become* aphorisms. And, *as* Roger King of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology *points out*, `主` their riches -- the two Messrs Ma *are worth* a combined $88bn -- `谓` *provoke* admiration *rather than* envy.

This sentiment *may be reinforced* by the high share of startups that *turn into* “unicorns”. China *has* 206 privately held companies *valued* at $1bn or more, more than any other country. Beijing alone *hosts* 82, more than San Francisco’s tally(n.) of 55, according to Hurun Report, a research firm. They *include* ByteDance, the world’s mightiest unicorn (which *owns* TikTok, a hit(n.) short-video app, and *is valued* at $90bn or thereabouts).


Unicorns *are not*, of course, a representative sample of private enterprise. But they *nonetheless illustrate that* Chinese entrepreneurship *is broad* as well as deep. According to Vision Plus Capital, a venture-capital firm, a big share of the herd *grazes around* cities (with a high startup density per million residents), such as Hangzhou (31), Shenzhen (27) and Beijing (24). But their founders *are* a more geographically diverse(a.) bunch. Hurun *lists* 112 founders of Chinese startups worth $1.5bn or more. `主` The 78 whose birthplace (The Economist *has been able to identify* in China) `谓` *hail from* 20 provincial-level regions (see map).

The founders of Kuaishou, a video-sharing app, Musical.ly, which *became* TikTok, and WeChat, a ubiquitous(a.) messaging app *owned by* Tencent, *all came from* inland Hunan province. Its capital, Changsha, *houses*(v.) more than 12,000 companies in the creative and cultural industries, *luring* more go-getters(n.) in these fields. Longyan, an otherwise unremarkable city in Fujian province, *has spawned* Zhang Yiming of ByteDance and Wang Xing of Meituan-Dianping, a now-listed super-app with a market capitalisation of $75bn.

Successful founders *often nurture*(v.) entrepreneurship in their home regions. A dozen Longyan-bred ones, *including* Mr Wang and Mr Zhang, *have participated in* a “Summit of New Rising Internet Stars from Longyan”. Cai Wensheng, a Fujianese high-school dropout(n.) who *made* billions 方式状 *trading* internet domain names, *has invested in* dozens of local startups. In 2015 Alibaba’s Mr Ma *opened* the Hupan School, *dreamed up* in the midst of the global financial crisis (a few years earlier) *as* China’s answer to Harvard Business School (itself founded during the banking panic of 1907).

If businesspeople *have been tending(v.) to* the entrepreneurial garden, local authorities *have been heaping* fertiliser on it. Zhejiang, where Wenzhou *is also located*, *embraced* small businesses as soon as Deng Xiaoping *lifted* the Mao-era ban on them in 1979. Lending(n.) from Zhejiang’s state banks *allowed* some early stars *to rise*. They *included* Zong Qinghou, a juice-and-soda tycoon who *founded* Wahaha in 1987; Guo Guangchang, an industrialist(n.) who *began* Fosun Group in 1992; and later Ding Lei of NetEase, a gaming giant *set up* in 1997.

More recently Dream Town, a state-run startup village near Alibaba’s campus in Hangzhou, *has been handing out* cash and free office space *to* promising founders. Xiamen, a city in Fujian, *offers* the 3,000 startups (in its Software Park) 双宾 generous(a.) subsidies for rent and research and development. Firms *got* preferential loans and a two-year waiver(n.) on corporate tax, *plus* a discount for another three.

China’s vibrant(a.) ecosystem of private enterprise *faces* three challenges. First, Chinese startups and small businesses, *like* everywhere else in the world, *have been hit hard* by the lockdowns. Their revenues *fell* by almost 60% in March, year on year, according to a survey by Tsinghua University in Beijing. CBInsights, a data provider, *says* the number of deals involving Chinese startups *dropped* by nearly 40% in the first quarter, *compared with* the previous one, *to* the lowest level since 2016. Early-stage funding *declined* by 70%.

*To help out*, Beijing *has told* banks *that* smaller companies *may delay* loan repayments up to the end of June. [On April 23rd] officials in Zhongguancun, the capital’s tech hub, *teamed up with* 30 venture-capital firms *to launch* a 30bn yuan ($4.2bn) investment campaign *to support* startups. Some large corporations *are stepping up*, too. Xiaomi, a smartphone-maker, *participated in* nine equity deals(n.) in the first quarter, one more than in the previous three months. Alibaba *has launched* the “2020 Spring Thunder Initiative” *to help* smaller export-oriented businesses *expand into* new markets. Ant Financial, its finance arm, *has teamed up with* hundreds of commercial banks *to offer loans(n.) to* tens of millions of smaller firms. Ant’s payment business, AliPay, *is helping* 50,000 merchants(n.) *move online*, in part *by providing* free online courses. Daniel Zhang, Alibaba’s boss, *said* the company *must “stand [arm in arm]” with* the little guy.

Inconstant gardeners

Not everyone *is* as obliging(a.). State-owned lenders *refuse to extend new loans to* many smaller firms, *favouring* lumbering(a.) state-owned champions. And Beijing’s ongoing(a.) crackdown on informal sources of lending, *on which* most private businesses *rely*, *has starved* many of resources.

This increasingly heavy hand *is* the private sector’s second problem. The party *looks more hostile(a.) to it* than at any time since before Deng *set up* “special economic zones”, capitalist(a.) sandboxes for firms, in the 1980s. Mr Xi *favours* state-led development *over* private-sector effervescence(n.), *maybe seeing* the cult of entrepreneurs *as* a rival source of authority. The former party boss in Zhejiang and provincial(a.) head of equally enterprising(a.) Fujian *has disappointed* those (who *say* breakthroughs(n.) *require* an environment where people are free, *in the words of* R. May Lee, “*to indulge*, *to daydream* and *to do things differently*”). Ms Lee *stepped down* as dean of the School of Entrepreneurship and Management at ShanghaiTech University in 2018 *partly out of* frustration over increasing state control of the curriculum.

The third worry for many Chinese firms *is* the prospect of *being shut off from the world*. This *is not* wholly China’s fault; America *has limited* exports of certain technologies to Chinese buyers *as* part of a trade war between the two superpowers. But Mr Xi’s pursuit of greater autonomy from the West *will make it harder* for Chinese firms *to procure* kit and components unavailable at home, *including* advanced microprocessors, and, increasingly, *to attract* business partners abroad. Officials’ early response to the virus, when they *tried to suppress* reports of the original outbreak in Hubei province, *has only added to* foreign queasiness of all things Chinese.

It is a testament to the private sector’s strength in China that it *has held up*. The share prices of smaller listed firms *have done* only half *as badly* in the pandemic *as* those of their counterparts in America and Europe. Whereas America’s small businesses *have underperformed* its biggest corporations by a factor of two, in China the small fry *have done nearly as well as* the whales (see chart). Once the crisis *passes*, venture capitalists, *including* home-grown ones, *will no doubt loosen* their purse strings.

And although Mr Xi *has been less green-fingered(a.) than* his predecessors, he *is unlikely to pave*(v.) over China’s flowerbeds of enterprise. The party *realises that* its promise of future growth(n.) *requires* a robust private sector. *As* one veteran foreign observer *adds*, it is also a useful “vaccine” -- one that *inoculates*(v.) the regime *against* those too wilful(a.) to serve(v.) its interests as bureaucrats. Better for them *to channel(v.) energy into* entrepreneurship. Luckily for Mr Xi, many *are still happy* to do just that.
