== Not quite all there

(eco 2020-5-2 / Briefing / The post-covid economy: Not quite all there )

The 90% economy that lockdowns *will leave behind*

It *will not just be* smaller, it *will feel strange*

Apr 30th 2020 |


IN THE 1970s Masahiro Mori, a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, *observed that* there was something disturbing(a.) about robots which *looked* almost, but not quite, *like* people. Representations in this “uncanny(a.) valley” *are* `表` close enough to lifelike(a.) *for* `主` their shortfalls(n.) and divergences(n.) from the familiar `谓` *to be* particularly disconcerting(a.). Today’s Chinese economy *is exploring* a similarly unnerving(a.) new terrain. And the rest of the world *is following in* its uncertain steps.

Whatever the drawbacks of these new lowlands, they *are assuredly preferable to* the abyss of lockdown. `主` Measures *taken to reverse* the trajectory of the pandemic around the world `谓` *have brought with them* remarkable economic losses.

Not all sectors of the economy *have done terribly*. New subscriptions to Netflix *increased* at twice(ad.) their usual rate in the first quarter of 2020, with most of that growth *coming* in March. In America, the sudden stop of revenue from Uber’s ride-sharing service in March and April *has been partially cushioned* by the 25% increase of sales from its food-delivery unit, according to 7Park Data, a data provider.

Yet the general pattern *is* grim. Data from Womply, a firm which *processes transactions*(n.) on behalf of 450,000 small businesses across America, *show that* businesses in all sectors *have lost* substantial revenue. Restaurants, bars and recreational businesses *have been badly hit*: revenues *have declined* some two-thirds since March 15th. Travel and tourism *may suffer* the worst losses. In the EU, where tourism *accounts for* some 4% of GDP, the number of people travelling by plane *fell* from 5m to 50,000; on April 19th less than 5% of hotel rooms in Italy and Spain *were occupied*.



*According to* calculations *made* on behalf of The Economist by Now-Casting Economics, a research firm that *provides* high-frequency economic forecasts to institutional investors, the world economy *shrank* by 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020, *driven by* a 6.8% year-on-year decline in China’s GDP. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York *draws on* measures such as jobless claims *to produce* a weekly index of American economic output. It *suggests that* the country’s GDP *is currently running* about 12% lower *than* it was a year ago (see chart 1).

These figures *fit with* attempts by Goldman Sachs, a bank, *to estimate* the relationship *between* the severity of lockdowns *and* their effect on output. It *finds, roughly, that* an Italian-style lockdown *is associated with* a GDP decline of 25%. Measures *to control* the virus while either *keeping* the economy *running reasonably smoothly*, as in South Korea, or *reopening* it, as in China, *are associated with* a GDP reduction in the region of 10%. That *chimes with* data which *suggest that* if Americans *chose to avoid* person-to-person proximity of the length of an arm or less, `主` occupations *worth approximately* 10% of national output `谓` *would become* unviable.

The “90% economy” (thus *created*) *will be*, by definition, *smaller than* that which came before. But its strangeness *will be* more than a matter of size. There *will undoubtedly be* relief, fellow feeling, and *newly felt or expressed* esteem(n.) *for* those who *have worked* to keep people safe. But there *will also be* residual(a.) fear, pervasive uncertainty, a lack of innovative fervour(n.) and deepened inequalities. The fraction of life that is missing *will colour*(v.) people’s experience and behaviour in ways that *will not be offset*(v.) by the happy fact that `主` most of what matters `系` *is* still available and *ticking over*. In a world where the office is open *but* the pub is not, `主` qualitative(a.) differences(n.) in the way (life feels) `系` *will be* [at least] as significant as the drop in output.

The plight of the pub *demonstrates that* the 90% economy *will not be* something *that can be fixed by fiat*. `主` *Allowing* pubs -- and other places of social pleasure -- *to open* `谓` *counts for(v.) little* if people *do not want to visit* them. Many people *will have to leave the home* in order to work, but they *may well feel less comfortable doing so* to have a good time. A poll by YouGov *on behalf of* The Economist *finds that* {over a third of Americans *think* it *will be* “several months” before it will be safe to reopen businesses as normal} -- *which suggests that* if businesses *do reopen* some, at least, may *stay away*.

Ain’t nothing but tired

`主` Some indication (that the spending effects(n.) of a lockdown *will persist* even after it is over) `谓` *comes* from Sweden. Research by Niels Johannesen of Copenhagen University and colleagues *finds that* aggregate-spending patterns in Sweden and Denmark over the past months *look similarly reduced*, even though Denmark *has had* a pretty strict lockdown while official Swedish provisions *have been exceptionally relaxed*. This *suggests that* personal choice, *rather than* government policy, *is* the biggest factor behind the drop. And personal choices *may be* harder to reverse.


Discretionary(a.) spending(n.) by Chinese consumers -- the sort (that *goes on* things economists *do not see as* essentials) -- *is* 40% off its level a year ago. Haidilao, a hotpot chain, *is seeing* a bit more than three parties(n.) per table per day -- an improvement, but still lower than the 4.8 registered last year, according to a report by Goldman Sachs published in mid-April. Breweries *are selling* 40% less beer. STR, a data-analytics firm, *finds that* just one-third of hotel beds in China *were occupied* during the week ending April 19th. Flights *remain* far from full (see chart 2).

This less social world *is not* necessarily bad news for every company. UBS, a bank, *reports that* a growing number of people in China *say that* the virus *has increased* their desire *to buy* a car -- presumably *in order to avoid* the risk of infection on public transport. The number of passengers on Chinese underground trains *is* still about a third below last year’s level; surface traffic congestion *is* as bad now as it was then.

*Wanting* a car, though, *will not mean* being able to *afford* one. Drops in discretionary(a.) spending *are not entirely driven* by a residual(a.) desire for isolation. They also *reflect the fact that* some people *have* a lot less money in the post-lockdown world. Not `主` all those who *have lost jobs* `谓` *will quickly find* new ones, *not least because* there *is* little demand for labour-intensive services such as leisure(n.) and hospitality(n.). Even those in jobs *will not feel* secure, the Chinese experience *suggests*. Since late March `主` the share of people (*worried about* salary cuts) `谓` *has risen slightly*, to 44%, *making it* 双宾 their biggest concern for 2020, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. Many *are now recouping* the loss of income that they *suffered* during the most acute phase of the crisis, or *paying down* debt. All this *points to* high saving rates in the future, *reinforcing* low consumption.

A 90% economy *is*, on one level, an astonishing achievement. *Had* the pandemic *struck* even two decades ago, only a tiny minority of people *would have been able to work* or *satisfy* their needs. *Watching* a performance of Beethoven on a computer, or *eating* a meal from a favourite restaurant at home, *is not the same as* the real thing -- but it is not bad. The lifting of the most stringent lockdowns *will also provide* respite(n.), both emotionally and physically, since the mere experience of *being told* what you can and cannot do *is* unpleasant. Yet [in three main ways] a 90% economy *is* a big step *down from* what came before the pandemic. It *will be* more fragile; it *will be* less innovative; and it *will be* more unfair.

*Take* fragility *first*. The return to a semblance of normality *could be* fleeting(a.). Areas which *had apparently controlled* the spread of the virus, *including* Singapore and northern Japan, *have imposed or reimposed* tough restrictions *in response to* a rise in the growth rate of new infections. If countries which *retain* relatively tough social-distancing rules *do better at* staving(v.) off a viral comeback, other countries *may feel* a need to follow them (see Chaguan). With rules in flux(n.), it *will feel* hard *to plan* weeks ahead, *let alone* months.

*Can’t start* a fire

The behaviour of the economy *will be* far less predictable. No one *really knows* `主` for how long firms *facing* zero revenues, or households who *are working* reduced hours or not at all, `谓` *will be able to survive financially*. Businesses *can keep going temporarily*, either *by burning cash* or *by tapping(v.) grants*(n.) and credit lines(n.) *set up by* government -- but these *are unlimited*(a.) neither in size nor duration. What is more, a merely illiquid(a.) firm *can quickly become* a truly insolvent(a.) one 因为 as its earnings *stagnate*(v.) while its debt commitments(n.) *expand*. `主` A rise in corporate(a.) and personal bankruptcies, long after the apparently acute phase of the pandemic, `系` *seems likely*, though governments *are trying to forestall* them. [In the past fortnight] bankruptcies in China *started to rise* relative to last year. On April 28th HSBC, one of the world’s largest banks, *reported* worse-than-expected results, in part because of higher credit losses.

Furthermore, the pandemic *has upended* norms and conventions about how economic agents *behave*. In Britain `主` the share of commercial tenants(n.) who *paid* their rent on time `谓` *fell* from 90% to 60% in the first quarter of this year. A growing number of American renters *are no longer paying* their landlords. Other creditors *are being put off*, too. In America, close to 40% of business-to-business payments from firms in the spectator-sports and film industries *were* late in March, *double* the rate a year ago. Enforcing contracts *has become* more difficult 表原因 with many courts *closed* and social interactions at a standstill. This is perhaps the most insidious(a.) means(n.) by which weak sectors of the economy *will infect* otherwise moderately healthy ones.

In an environment of uncertain property rights and unknowable income streams(n.), potential investment projects *are not just* risky(a.) -- they *are* impossible *to price*(v.). A recent paper by Scott Baker of Northwestern University and colleagues *suggests that* economic uncertainty *is* at an all-time high. That *may go [some way] to explaining* the results of a weekly survey from Moody’s Analytics, a research firm, which *finds that* businesses’ investment intentions *are substantially lower* even than during the financial crisis of 2007-09. An index which *measures* American nonresidential(a.) construction activity (9-12 months ahead) *has also hit* new lows.

The collapse in investment *points to* the second trait of the 90% economy: that it *will be* less innovative. The development of liberal capitalism over the past three centuries *went hand in hand with* a growth in the number of people *exchanging ideas* in public or quasi-public spaces. Access to the coffeehouse, the salon or the street protest *was* always a partial process, *favouring* some people *over* others. But a vibrant(a.) public sphere *fosters* creativity.

Innovation *is not impossible* in a world with less social contact. There *is* more than one company *founded* in a garage *now worth* $1trn. During lockdowns, companies *have had to innovate quickly* -- just *look at* how many firms *have turned their hand* to making ventilators, if *with* mixed success 成败参半. A handful(n.) of firms *claim that* working from home *is* [so] productive [that] their offices *will stay closed [for good]*.


Yet these productivity bonuses(n.) *look likely to be heavily outweighed*(v.) by drawbacks. Studies *suggest* the benefits of working from home *only materialise* if employees *can frequently check in* at an office in order to solve problems. *Planning* new projects *is* especially difficult. Anyone who *has tried to bounce(v.) ideas around* on Zoom or Skype *knows that* spontaneity(n.) is hard. People *are often using* bad equipment with poor connections. Nick Bloom of Stanford University, one of the few economists *to have studied* working from home *closely*, *reckons that* there *will be* a sharp decline in patent applications in 2021.

Cities *have proven particularly* fertile(a.) ground for innovations which *drive* long-run growth. If Geoffrey West, a physicist who *studies* complex systems, *is* right *to suggest that* doubling(v.) a city’s population *leads to* all concerned(a.) *becoming* on aggregate 15% richer, *then* the emptying-out of urban areas *is* bad news. MoveBuddha, a relocation website, *says that* searches for places(n.) in New York City’s suburbs *are up* almost 250% *compared with* this time last year. A paper from New York University *suggests that* richer, and thus presumably more educated, New Yorkers -- people (*from whom* a disproportionate(a.) share of ideas *may flow*) -- *are particularly likely to have left* during the epidemic.

Something *happening somewhere*

Wherever or however people *end up working*, the experience of living in a pandemic *is not conducive(a.) to* creative thought. How many people *entered* lockdown *with* a determination *to immerse themselves in* Proust or George Eliot, only *to find* themselves *slumped* in front of “Tiger King”? When mental capacity *is taken up* by worries about whether or not *to touch* that door handle or whether or not *to believe* the results of the latest study on the virus, focusing *is* difficult. Women *are more likely to take care of* home-schooling and entertainment of bored children (see article), *meaning* their careers *suffer* more than men’s. Already, research by Tatyana Deryugina, Olga Shurchkov and Jenna Stearns, three economists, *finds that* the productivity of female economists, as *measured by* production of research papers, *has fallen* relative to male ones since the pandemic *began*.



The growing gender divide(n.) in productivity *points to* the final big problem with the 90% economy: that *it is unfair*. Liberally regulated economies (*operating* at full capacity) *tend to have* unemployment rates of 4-5%, *in part because* there *will always be* people temporarily unemployed 当...时 as they *move* from one job to another. The new normal *will have* higher joblessness. This *is not just because* GDP will be lower; the decline in output *will be particularly concentrated in* labour-intensive industries *such as* leisure and hospitality, *reducing* employment *disproportionately*. America’s current unemployment rate, real-time data *suggest*, *is* between 15-20%.

The lost jobs *tended to pay badly*, and *were more likely to be performed* by the young, women and immigrants. Research by Abi Adams-Prassl of Oxford University and colleagues *finds that* an American who *normally earns* less than $20,000 a year *is* twice [*as*] likely to have lost their job [*due to* the pandemic] *[as]* one (*earning* $80,000-plus). Many of those unlucky people *do not have* the skills, nor the technology, that *would enable them* to work from home or *to retrain* for other jobs.

*The longer* the 90% economy endures(v.), *the more* such inequalities will deepen(v.). People who *already enjoy* strong professional networks -- largely, those of middle age and higher -- *may actually quite enjoy* the experience of working from home. *Notwithstanding*(prep.) the problems of bad internet and irritating children, it *may be* quite pleasant *to chair* fewer meetings or performance reviews. Junior folk, even if they make it into an office, *will miss out on* the expertise(n.) and guidance of their seniors. Others with poor professional networks, such as the young or recently arrived immigrants, *may find* it difficult or impossible *to strengthen* them, *hindering* upward mobility, *points out* Tyler Cowen of George Mason University.

The world economy (that *went into retreat*(n.) in March 当...时 as covid-19 *threatened* lives) *was* one that *looked sound(a.) and strong*. And the biomedical community *is currently working overtime to produce* a vaccine that *will allow* the world *to be restored to* its full capacity. But estimates *suggest that* this *will take* at least another 12 months -- and, as with the prospects of the global economy, that figure *is* highly uncertain. If the adage that it *takes* two months *to form* a habit holds, the economy (that *re-emerges*) *will be* fundamentally different.
