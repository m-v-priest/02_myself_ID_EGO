The government is anxious, too

“GRADUATION *EQUALS* unemployment” has long been a common saying in China (the nouns *share* a character). It *is often used* in jest by university students 当...时 as final exams *loom*(v.). But for the 9m [or so] *due to graduate* in June -- a record high -- the words *convey*(v.) a dark reality. As China *limps back to* work(n.) after covid-19, their job prospects are truly bleak. They *will enter* the workforce 当...时 as prospective employers *mull*(v.) lay-offs(n.) or hiring freezes. For a middle class (*used(a.) to* relentlessly strong economic growth), the shock will be great.

As it *surveys* an economy (*ravaged* by the disease), the leadership’s biggest worry is unemployment. In February the urban jobless rate jumped to 6.2%, the highest ever. In March it fell slightly to 5.9% as businesses reopened. But official figures *mask*(v.) the scale of the problem. Urban unemployment could reach 10% this year, *reckons* the Economist Intelligence Unit, a sister company of The Economist. And that does not include the tens of millions of migrants who *sat out* the epidemic in their ancestral(a.) villages. Many of them now *have* no jobs *to return to* in the cities.

China’s leaders *describe* the problem of graduate unemployment *as* a matter of “paramount importance”. In recent days university officials *around* the country *have been holding meetings* to discuss(v.) how to ensure that {[as many as possible] *find* jobs}. They *have often used* similar language, *stressing* the “urgency” of this “political task” *relating to* “social stability”. Jobless migrants *make* officials anxious, too. But the party *frets more about threats* involving better-educated people (with urban roots /and strong social networks).

Last year just over half of entrants(n.) to China’s urban workforce *were* university graduates. Usually about 60% of them would be hired by small- and medium-sized enterprises. But such firms *have been* among those (*hardest-hit* by the coronavirus). On April 14th Li Keqiang, the prime minister, told his cabinet that the situation for this year’s graduates *was* “grim”.

Companies *normally begin* *scouring*(v.) campuses *for* recruits soon after the spring-festival holiday (another big hiring round *takes place* in the autumn). This time, however, with universities *shut* and big gatherings *banned*, the entire process *was “wiped out”*, says a business veteran.

Some employers *have gone* digital, using video interviews and online tests. But many, *reeling from* the impact of work stoppages(n.) and still-tepid(a.) consumer demand, *have cut* hiring. A survey of 1m companies by Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management and Zhaopin, a job-search site, *found* there *were* 30% fewer openings(n.) in the first quarter *compared with* last year. Those for fresh graduates in finance *fell* by more than 50% this spring, according to Boss Zhipin, another recruitment website -- even as the number of final-year students (*searching for* a job) *rose* by half. With less competition, firms that are still hiring *can pick* the best and brightest. But they are also likely *to plump for* old hands rather than trainees.

Competition for graduate jobs *had already grown fierce* in recent years, particularly for the most prestigious positions. Now it is cut-throat(a.). Miriam Zhang, a graduate from Weifang, a city in the northern province of Shandong, *has sent out* 100 applications in the past two months and got responses only to six. One job, she *heard*, *had attracted* 3,000 hopefuls(n.).

At least the epidemic *has helpfully “weeded out”* weak or dodgy companies, Ms Zhang *notes*. She *is* now keener(a.) than ever *to get hired* by a big firm, and *is mainly searching for* openings(n.) at state-owned companies. In a survey by China Youth Daily, an official newspaper, more than 60% of respondents *said* covid-19 *had steered* them *towards* “more stable” work. [To many] that *means* finding an employer with links to the government.

Officials are trying to satisfy such demand. They have promised more openings in the civil service (not least in rural areas) as well as in the army. They *have directed* state-owned businesses *to boost* their recruitment of new graduates. Sinopec, an oil giant, *is hiring* another 3,500 *on top of* the 6,600-odd *it has already taken on* -- the most people *it has ever signed up* in a year. Other state-owned firms *are also taking on* record numbers. They *are giving preference(n.) to* graduates from Hubei province, where the outbreak *began*. (This is *in response to* an appeal from the central government that firms *should stop* *discriminating(v.) against* Hubei residents, who *are often treated with suspicion* because of their province’s reputation as a covid-19 disaster zone.) The government has also told universities to offer an additional 200,000 places for graduate studies.

Until recently, job-hunting (involving intercity travel) *was hampered* by quarantine-related restrictions. Even though such measures *have been eased* in most places, hassles(n.) *remain* (see Chaguan). Wang Zheqi, who is meant(a.) to graduate this year in Shanghai, had hoped to use her dorm room as a base for job-hunting. Instead she is stuck in her hometown because her university is still closed and she *cannot afford* off-campus accommodation in Shanghai.

Students *did not have to search for jobs* until the 1990s. Instead they had to take positions (*assigned to them* by the government). As a result of covid-19, officials *are getting more involved in* finding(v.) work for students *than* they have been since those days. Xinchao Media, an advertising company, says that the government of Chengdu, the south-western city where the firm is headquartered, *has offered* to recommend graduates *for* its job openings. The city of Beijing, among others, has launched a recruitment website for people preparing to graduate.

Many governments *are also rewarding* firms that *hire* graduates. In Shanghai, the district of Pudong *is offering* them subsidies and *reduced* social-security payments worth up to 2,000 yuan ($282) for each local graduate they take on. Others *are giving* refunds(n.) on social-security contributions(n.) *to* companies that *do not lay off* workers.

The government is right to worry about social stability. Well-educated young people have been in the vanguard(n.) of many of China’s biggest protest movements of the past century. `主` Students (whose futures *are clouded* by the unaffordability of housing(n.) /and competition for jobs with immigrants from the Chinese mainland) `系` were *at the forefront of* last year’s unrest in Hong Kong. As the covid crisis *subsides*(v.) in China, social tensions are becoming more evident. Hundreds of shop owners recently *took to* the streets of the southern city of Guangzhou and dozens *gathered* outside a mall in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, *to demand* rent deductions after weeks of unemployment. (Videos of the protests were swiftly removed from the internet.)

Graduating at a time of such economic hardship could be more than just a temporary setback. Studies show that it can have “a huge impact” on lifetime earnings, says Li Jin of the University of Hong Kong. That is because many *will go into* a different line of work *from* the one they had hoped to pursue, and for lower pay. In normal times, according to Zhaopin, a third of Chinese graduates *aim to earn* between 6,000 and 8,000 yuan a month in their first jobs, but fewer than one in five *end up* doing so. Their disappointment *will be* far greater this year -- and *may last* well beyond it.

== 101.  Battling to be American

(eco 2020-5-2 / United States / Military service and citizenship: Battling to be American)

`主` The path to citizenship for those who *put on* American uniform `谓` *has narrowed*

Military service *was* a time-honoured(a.) way *to earn* citizenship. No longer

Apr 30th 2020 | NEW YORK


WHEN Baron Friedrich von Steuben 人名, a Prussian officer helping the Continental Army, *asked* for a translator at Valley Forge 地名 *to address* some troops during America’s revolutionary war, the story goes that he was told there was no need. This particular group *were* immigrants and *spoke* German. Colonial militias *offered* state citizenship *to* soldiers. The Continental Congress *granted* citizenship *even to* enemy soldiers who *switched* sides. The baron *was later given* American citizenship *for helping to see off* the Brits.

Since 1952, immigrants *have been able to apply for* citizenship after one year of honourable service during peacetime. In wartime they *have been able to become Americans* almost as soon as they join up. Since the September 11th *attacks*(v.) in 2001, more than 100,000 service members *have become* citizens. But this avenue(n.) to citizenship *is* no longer assured.

*In order for* the naturalisation process *to begin*, the Department of Defence *has to sign* an honourable-service certification form. Without it, the Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) *will not consider* the applicant. In October 2017 the department *adopted* stricter vetting(n.); as a result, *claims* a new lawsuit, it is very difficult for service members *to be naturalised speedily*. This policy change(n.) *is* “a departure from pretty close to 200 years of US history”, says Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute, a think-tank.

Ange Samma, along with five other active-duty(a.) service members, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an advocacy(n.) group, *filed*(v.) a class-action lawsuit(n.) against the Department of Defence on April 24th. Private Samma *enlisted* in 2018 and *is serving* in South Korea. *Originally from* Burkina Faso 非洲一国家名, he *came to* America *as* a teenager. According to the suit, it *took* multiple requests(n.) for him *to receive* the honourable-service certification form. When he finally did, USCIS *rejected it* 因为 as his officers *had not filled it out properly*. Without citizenship, he *cannot get* security clearance for some army work. He *is not* alone. Scarlet Kim, an ACLU lawyer, *says that* thousands of service members *are having* similar difficulties.

In 2018 there *was* a 70% drop in naturalisation applicants(n.) from the armed forces [after the extra vetting(n.) *was put in place*]. The lawsuit says the servicemen *would have been naturalised faster* if they *had taken* the lengthy civilian route. Their applications *are being rejected* at a higher rate *than* civilian ones. Margaret Stock, a retired lieutenant-colonel and now an immigration lawyer, says some serving soldiers *are placed in* deportation proceedings by the same government that they *volunteered to fight for*, before the application process *has been completed*.

Some countries *are loosening* citizen-enlistment rules because of military-recruitment problems, but only a few *make* service a path to citizenship as America does. This distinction *helps with* recruiting. [Without immigrants] the army *would have failed to meet* its goals nearly every year between 2002 and 2013. A Department of Defence report(n.) in 2016 *found that* non-citizens *perform(v.) better*, *have* lower attrition rates and *are more likely to have* medical and IT expertise *than* their citizen counterparts. *Not only do* they *make* useful recruits(n.) to the armed forces; they *would make* good citizens, too.
