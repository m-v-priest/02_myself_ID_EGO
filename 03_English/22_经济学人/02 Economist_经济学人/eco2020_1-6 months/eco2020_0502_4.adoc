America’s cities and states *face* a cash crunch

Help from the federal government and the Federal Reserve *may be* on the way

May 2nd 2020 | WESTCHESTER COUNTY


NO COUNTY IN New York, outside the city and Long Island, *has seen* more cases of covid-19 than Westchester, just north of the Bronx. For weeks tens of thousands of would-be commuters *have been staying home*. Bars, restaurants and other businesses *have been closed*.

Sales-tax revenue, usually around $500m, *may be down* by as much as $100m this year. With fewer people *travelling*, hotel-tax receipts *will be* lower. Meanwhile, spending on emergency and health services *has soared*. The county *may face* a shortfall of up to $160m on a $2.1bn annual budget. It *can hope for* [at best] limited help from the state of New York, which itself *expects* a 14% decline in revenue, *due to* lower corporate- and personal-income-tax receipts, *requiring* $7.3bn in spending cuts(n.) in the next budget. “We’ve done a variety of projections,” *explains* George Latimer, the county executive: “Bad, worse, even worse and totally horrible.”



Mr Latimer *is not* alone. Shortfalls *have hit* local governments across America -- and *not* just in covid-battered places. Wyoming, for instance, *claims* to have around 400 confirmed cases, but *may face* a collapse in revenue of 30% over the next two years, *driven by* low oil prices and electricity demand (it is America’s leading coal-producing state). The National Association of Counties *estimates that* revenue declines and covid-related spending increases *could take* $144bn out of county budgets through the upcoming fiscal year. The Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a left-leaning think-tank, *reckons that* states *will face* an even bigger shortfall, of $350bn, next year (see chart). The prospect of such shortfalls *led* investors *to sell off* municipal bonds in March, *causing* yields(n.) *to rise sharply*. Terrifying though these numbers are, there *may also be grounds for* hope.

*Start with* the horror. Most states *begin* their next fiscal year on July 1st. States and cities *issue*(v.) debt *to fund* long-term infrastructure projects, such as *building* hospitals or schools. But for the most part -- because of a combination of constitutional requirement, statute and tradition -- they *must balance* their budgets, and *cannot use* debt *to fund* operating costs. When revenues *fall*, therefore, states *must cut spending* or *raise taxes*. *With* so many people *out of work*, and uncertainty(n.) over whether and when consumer spending *will return*, states *will want to keep* tax increases *minimal*. That *leaves* only one alternative: *deep spending* cuts.

Anything remotely discretionary(a.) is probably imperilled, as *is* education, which *was cut heavily* after the 2007-09 crisis. Local governments *may also have to start furloughing* and *firing people*. High unemployment *will make* that *especially painful*. `主` Chris Coons,  a Democratic senator from Delaware who [during the financial crisis] *ran* his state’s most populous county, `谓` *warns that* municipal lay-offs *could hit* “employees (*processing* unemployment cheques) … or those who *will be critical to* retraining and placement of people unemployed now, or folks who *provide* critical community services.”

Fortunately, most states *are* in a better position *than* they were before the last recession. In mid-2019 tax revenues in every state but five *had exceeded* their pre-recession levels (commodity-dependent Wyoming and Alaska *were* among the exceptions). All states but four *reported that* they *had collected* more revenue in the year to July 2019 than expected.

Rainy-day funds *also hit* an all-time high, with the median(n.) *covering* 8% of general-fund expenditures. The healthy average, though, *masks*(v.) wide gaps. On the whole, western states *appear* in better shape *than* hard-hit(a.) north-eastern ones. New York’s kitty, for instance, *is* just 3.2% of general-fund expenditures; New Jersey’s and Pennsylvania’s *are* at 1% each. *Drawing down* around half of these funds *would allow* states *to plug*(v.) around $36bn of the shortfall. Federal aid (*passed* [to date]) *has provided* another $281bn.

More *is probably coming*. A Senate bill *sponsored by* Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, *would disburse*(v.) $500bn *to* state and local governments in proportion to their populations, revenue losses and number of covid-19 cases. Its chances of passing the Republican-controlled Senate *are* slim. But even Mitch McConnell, the majority leader -- who at first *suggested that* states *be allowed to go bankrupt* -- *concedes that* cities and states *will probably receive* more federal funds.

In order to *calm* the bond market, the Federal Reserve *has said* it *will buy* up to $500bn of state and local debt. On April 27th it *amended* its programme *to include* more states and cities. It now *plans to buy* investment-grade bonds *issued by* states and counties with a population of at least 500,000, and cities with a population of at least 250,000. That *excludes* smaller places, but *lets* states and counties *use* the proceeds of their sales *to* the Fed *to help* smaller entities.

Investors *hope* the combination of federal loans and aid *can keep* bond markets *stable*. Geoffrey Schechter of MFS Investment Management *believes that* a wave of defaults *is* unlikely: “states and local governments *recognise* they *need* access(n.) to capital markets.” An uncertain couple of months, *followed by* a lean(a.) few years: cautious optimism in a pandemic.
