== 38. Covid-19 is teaching hard lessons about China-only supply chains

(2020-02-29 / China / Chaguan: Globalisation under quarantine)

At the very least, an emotional decoupling *is* under way

Feb 27th 2020 |


UNTIL ABOUT the third week of January, only a few pharmaceutical executives, drug-safety inspectors and dogged(a.) China hawks *cared that* a large share of the world’s supply of antibiotics *depends on* a handful of Chinese factories. These *include* a cluster in Inner Mongolia, a northern province of windswept(a.) deserts, grasslands and unlovely industrial towns. Then *came* the covid-19 outbreak, and quarantine(n.) controls(n.) that *locked down* factories, ports and whole cities across China.

Chinese leaders *insist that* they *are well* on the way *to conquering* the virus, *allowing* them *to reopen* “leading enterprises and key links with important influence” in global supply chains. A victory over the novel coronavirus *will once again demonstrate* “the notable advantages of leadership by the Communist Party of China”, President Xi Jinping *told* 170,000 officials by video-conference on February 23rd. But even if all those boasts(n.) *come true*, foreign governments and business bosses *will not quickly forget* a frightening lesson: for some vital products, they *depend on* one country.

Where once only a few specialists *worried about* the market share *enjoyed by* the industrial chemists of Hohhot or Shijiazhuang, China’s dominance of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) sector *is* now the subject of hard questions in Washington’s corridors of power and the chancelleries of Europe. `主` *Ending* the world’s dependence on Chinese APIs `系` *would not be* a technical challenge. China *has not been dominant* for long. America’s last penicillin fermenter *closed* in 2004, as `主` clusters of Chinese factories, many state-owned or subsidised, `谓` *offered* efficiencies that foreign rivals *could not match*. Rather, change *would involve* upending(v.) well-established political and economic theories, *starting with* the wisdom of *allowing* private companies *to seek out* the best-value goods, with little heed(n.) *paid to* their origin.

There *is* much speculation about whether covid-19 *will accelerate* trends(n.) in America and other Western countries *to decouple* from China. In truth, `主` a rush to diversify in certain sectors `系` *is* more likely, and `主` even such a hedging of bets `谓` *would build on* trends(n.) that *have been visible* for some time.

The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional body, *held hearings*(n.) in July 2019 *on* threats and opportunities *created by* China’s medical industries. The tone *quickly veered(v.) towards* the doomy. A senior Pentagon official, Christopher Priest, *declared that* “`主` the national-security risks of increased Chinese dominance of the global API market `谓` *cannot be overstated*(v.).” He *invited* the hearing *to imagine* China *interrupting* supplies of irreplaceable drugs, such as those that *protect* troops *against* anthrax. Another witness, Benjamin Shobert, a health-care strategist at Microsoft, *noted that* mutual dependency *was once seen as* a reason *to believe that* Sino-American relations *were* stable and safe. But in an age of rising distrust, if those same calculated dependencies *were* to become a source of fear, then “`主` much of what *has supported* the modern era of globalisation `系` *is no longer valid*.”

For implacable China hawks like Peter Navarro, who *advises* President Donald Trump *[on trade]*, the covid-19 crisis *is* a told-you-so moment. On February 23rd Mr Navarro *told* Fox Business, a television channel, *that* America *had outsourced* “far too much” of its supply chain for essential medicines. “We *have got to get it back onshore*,” he *said*. Mr Navarro, an economic nationalist and vocal(a.) tariff advocate, *is little loved* by America’s trade partners. Yet his talk of nations needing to control certain forms of production *finds an echo* in rich-world capitals.

Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, *says* `主` China’s dominance in sectors like pharmaceuticals and pesticides `系` *is* a topic of concern when he *visits* officials in Berlin, Brussels and elsewhere. It *does not help that* China *has shown* itself willing(n.) *to use* trade *to bully* other countries during political disputes, as when it *denied* the export of rare earths *to* Japan in 2012. He *does not expect* firms *to leave China altogether*, because it *drives* global growth in so many sectors. But Mr Wuttke *expects* the epidemic *to intensify* European discussions about industrial policy. “The globalisation of *putting* everything where production is the most efficient, *that is over*.”

James McGregor, a China veteran who *heads* the Chinese operations of APCO, an American consultancy, *watched* businesses *putting ever more eggs in the China basket* for a decade. *Hit by* rising(a.) labour costs, trade tensions and now the virus, `主` companies `谓` *have concluded that* they *need to diversify* -- though many *are struggling to find* countries (with China’s infrastructure and adaptable labour force). Against that, `主` some firms (that are in China to sell to China) `谓` *are expanding production* there, in part *to avoid* the uncertainty of tariffs. The most capable high-tech companies *see China as* “the market of the future” for *[such]* promising(a.) industries *[as]* autonomous vehicles, robotics and the internet of things. They *may be rewarded* [for their faith]. “We *are going to see* the Chinese government *be extraordinarily nice to* companies [once this virus is over],” *suggests* Mr McGregor.

Foreign trade without foreigners

One visible impact of the virus *may be* to speed(v.) changes at the top of firms. Multinationals *have increasingly appointed* Chinese executives (often Western-educated) *to run* their China operations. The epidemic *may accelerate* departures [among the foreigners who *remain*]. Air pollution *has already driven many [away]*. Some old-timers *feel* less welcome in a China (*taking* a nationalist, authoritarian *turn*). Now they *are living alone* [after *evacuating* their families], or in temporary *exile* abroad *scrambling* to find children school places(n.) in home countries *they barely know*. “A lot of my contemporaries *don’t need* much of a push” to leave, *says* a long-time China hand. Even if covid-19 *burns out soon*, it *has clarified* how the world *is growing warier(a.) of* China. Few firms *can afford* to leave completely. But an emotional decoupling *is under way*.

== 39. The Trump administration doesn’t like high-skilled immigrants either

( 2020-02-29 /United States /  High-skilled immigration: The invisible wall)

The White House *is quietly making life hard* for them

Feb 29th 2020 | WASHINGTON, DC


[WHEN `主` SURESH IYER, who *designs* trading technology *for* a large financial firm in New York, `谓` *moved to* America from Mumbai in 2013] he *was not sure* {how long he *would stay*}. But his career *thrived*, his wife *moved* to join him /and soon they had a daughter. The family *put down roots* /and *decided* they *would like to settle permanently*. But it is not easy. Mr Iyer -- a pseudonym -- *is* on an H1B visa, a temporary permit for highly-skilled workers. He and his wife *qualify for* green cards (and their daughter *is* an American citizen). But *thanks to* an annual cap on the number of cards *available to* Indian workers, they *could be waiting* decades *to get them*. Mr Iyer’s *feels* {his life *is* on hold}. “It *is getting* crazier and crazier,” he says.

[Since long before his election in 2016] Donald Trump *has attacked* undocumented(a.) immigrants, whom he *sees as* criminals(n.) *coming* to sell drugs, *commit crimes* and *steal jobs*. His signature policy, *to build* a wall *on* the Mexican border, *has been fitfully effected*, though *without* the alligator moat (he *reportedly wanted*). When Mr Trump first *promised* to construct(v.) the wall, he *said* {it *would have* a “big beautiful door” *to let in* legal migrants}. In fact, under his administration, legal migrants *are finding* themselves *shut out too*. It *is not* only those *banned by* the president’s more dramatic(a.) executive orders; `主` families like Mr Iyer’s `谓` *are being affected* by the grinding of sand into the wheels of the immigration system. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), an industry group, *calls this* the president’s invisible wall.

`主` *Waiting* times *for* almost all sorts of visas, permits and renewals `谓` *have shot up*. *Applying for* a green card while in the United States *took* six and a half months in 2016; it now *takes* almost a year. `主` Work permits(n.), *typically issued to* the spouses of certain foreign workers, which *used to* take(v.) two months to process, `谓` now *take* almost twice that [on average]. Overall `主` the “adjudication rate”, or the share of applications *processed* in a given year, `谓` *has fallen sharply*, *from* 72% in 2015 *to* 56% last year. The number of visa forms (outstanding) *is* at its highest level ever, with 5.7m outstanding.

*Is* this gumming up of the system `表` deliberate(a.)? *It* is hard *to prove that*, *says* Sarah Pierce, of the Migration Policy Institute, a think-tank. But several policies *seem* perfectly designed(v.) to lengthen(v.) queues. All employment-based green-card applicants(n.) *must now have* a face-to-face interview, which *swallows up* officials’ time. `主` More and more applicants(n.) for work visas `谓` *are being asked* to provide(v.) supporting(a.) documents *to show* what their job *will involve* /or *prove* their qualifications. Before Mr Trump *took office*, at most a fifth of workers *were asked for* extra evidence. In the final quarter of last year, three-fifths *were*.

And *it is getting more expensive*. `主` *Applying for* a marriage-based green card, which *costs* $1,760 now, `谓` *will rise to* $2,750. *Becoming* a citizen will *go* from $640 to $1,170. Some people *would even have to pay* $50 *to apply for* asylum(n.). Yet staffing *is not increasing*. In fact, *as* Greg Chen of AILA *points out*, some of the agency’s budget *has even been directed towards* Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency *responsible for* deportations.

When somebody *was refused* an extension to their visa in the past, they *were usually trusted* to leave(v.) the country (and most *did*). These days they *are thrown straight into* immigration courts *for* deportation, *says* Mr Chen. Many of these people *probably qualified for* a visa, and *simply made a mistake* in *filling in* their applications.

Some groups *have been singled out*. In April 2017 Mr Trump *signed* the “*Buy* American, *Hire* American” executive order. That *tightened rules on* the H1B visas, the one (Mr Iyer *uses*), most of which *go to* Indian tech workers. Since Mr Trump’s executive order, denial rates *have shot up*, particularly [at large Indian-owned consultancies]. [In 2016] Infosys, one such company which *is* the largest single recipient of H1Bs, *was allowed* 14,000 visas. Just 3% of applicants *were rejected*. By last year, the figure *had fallen to* just 3,200 /and 36% of applicants *were rejected*. Consultancies *are being told*(v.) *to provide* evidence of exactly which clients(n.) (their workers *would be serving*), *for* the three-year length of their visas. *So much* for that big beautiful door.
