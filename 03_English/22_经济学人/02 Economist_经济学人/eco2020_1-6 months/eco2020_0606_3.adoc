- plan : ( especially in compounds 尤用于构成复合词 ) a way of investing money for the future 投资方式
-> *a savings plan* 储蓄计划

- 波士顿退休研究中心(CRR)估计，除非市场完全复苏，否则截至2020年6月的财年，美国各州和地方政府养老金计划的平均"提存比率", 将为69.5%。这是本世纪的最低水平。早在2000年，该平均计划就得到了全额资金。

Even that measure *relies on* the generous 慷慨的；大方的；慷慨给予的 way that public-sector  (国民经济中的) 公营部分 plans *can calculate* their pension liabilities 负债；债务.

- 即使这样的方式, 也依赖于公共部门计划中, 计算养老金负债的慷慨方式。支付养老金的成本, 会延续到未来几十年;这些预期付款必须"贴现"，以便计算当前的资金成本。贴现率越高，当前成本就越低。私营部门的养老基金, 必须使用目前处于低位的公司债券收益率, 作为"贴现率"; 而公共部门基金, 则被允许使用其投资的"预期回报率"。许多人认为这个比率是7-7.5%，这使得目前的养老金基金成本看起来更低。

In the long run 从长远来看, 终究, however, accounting conventions 会计惯例,会计常规 *cannot lower* 把…放低；使…降下 the actual cost of providing pensions. Many companies in the private sector *have abandoned* （不顾责任、义务等）离弃，遗弃，抛弃;停止（支持或帮助）；放弃（信念） offering(v.) pensions *linked to* workers’ final salaries *because of* the increased expense. The CRR figures *show that* the cost *has been steadily rising* for public-sector funds *as well*. Back in 2002 they *paid* an average of 7.8% of payrolls （公司的）工资总支出 *to fund* pensions; in 2020 that contribution *is likely to be* 19.7%, the highest [so far this century]. If a more conservative 低于实际数量的；保守的 accounting treatment 会计处理方式 *were used*, *closer to* the private-sector approach, that rate *would* double. Even *assuming* public pension funds *continue to use* their current approach, the CRR *estimates*, the contribution *may rise to* 29.1% of pay 工资；薪水 by 2025 if markets *are* slow to recover.

- *Accounting Convention* : An accounting procedure *used informally*. That is, an accounting convention *has been* [neither] *endorsed*(v.)公开支持; 赞同 [nor] *prohibited* by the SEC or another appropriate body. In general, when the SEC *has neither endorsed nor prohibited* an accounting convention, it is because *it has not needed to rule(v.) on the matter*, especially if the convention is new. A ruling *may formalize or forbid* a convention, or it *may make* the convention *obsolete*. +
一种非正式使用的会计程序。也就是说，会计惯例既没有得到SEC或其他适当机构的认可，也没有被禁止。一般来说，当SEC既不支持也不禁止一项会计惯例时，是因为它不需要对该事项进行裁决，尤其是如果该惯例是新的。一项裁决可以使一项公约形式化或禁止，也可以使该公约作废。 +
会计惯例(Accounting Convention)是会计人员在长期实践中, 所建立和广泛运用的处理会计业务的具体方法和程序。这些方法和程序，虽未经有关的权威会计团体和会计管理机构载人正式文件予以公布，但被广泛地采纳和应用. 会计惯例的形成起源于从业会计人员的习惯，而不是会计职业团体的规定。

But [by 2025] eight funds *may have* only enough assets *to cover* less than four years of benefits, the CRR *estimates*; three of these funds -- Chicago Municipal 市政的；地方政府的, Dallas Police and Fire, and New Jersey Teachers -- *will have* a mere two years’ worth. If that *happens*, taxpayers *will simply have to stump up* （为…）付钱，掏腰包 more money *to keep* benefits *flowing*.

- precisely : ad. used to emphasize that sth is very true or obvious （强调真实或明显）正是，确实 +
-> It's *precisely because* I care about you that I don't like you staying out late. 正因为我关心你，我才不要你太晚回家。

SYN cough up +
=> 美国西部大开发时，来到西部的开拓者一旦发现适合居住的地方，就开始砍伐树木，清出空地，开始修建房屋，开拓耕地。其中，一项很重要的工作就是从地上挖走树桩（stump）。由于这项工作十分费力，所以stump逐渐有了“难住某人”的意思。 一些没有移走的树桩成了开会时的演讲台。很多人喜欢站在树桩上当众讲话。据说华盛顿任大陆军总司令时，就多次站在树桩上给官兵讲话。因此后来，stump又有了“巡回竞选演讲”的意思。 +
来自 PIE*stebh,踩，踏，来自 PIE*sta,站立，词源同 stand,stamp,stomp. +
-> *I'm stumped*. I don't know how they got here before us. 我搞不懂了。我不知道他们怎么比我们来得还早。 +
-> We were asked *to stump up for* the repairs. 人家要我们出修理费。 +

- 这是一场缓慢的危机，恰恰是因为债务会持续数十年。但CRR估计，到2025年，8个基金的资产可能只够支付不到4年的福利费;其中三笔基金——芝加哥市政基金、达拉斯消防警察基金和新泽西教师基金——将只有两年的资金。如果这种情况发生，纳税人将不得不掏更多的钱来维持福利的流动。

== Counting the cost

America’s public-pension funding crisis worsens

Funding ratios have fallen and the cost of provision has risen

Jun 4th 2020 |


SHARE PRICES may have rallied from the depths they plumbed when the coronavirus pandemic was spreading rapidly around the world. But the S&P 500, America’s main stockmarket index, is still below its level at the start of the year. That is bad news for pension funds, which rely on their investments to pay out benefits to retired people.

Unless markets recover fully, the Centre for Retirement Research (CRR) in Boston estimates, the average funding ratio of American state and local-government pension plans for the fiscal year ending in June 2020 will be 69.5%. That is the lowest level this century. Back in 2000 the average plan was fully funded.

Even that measure relies on the generous way that public-sector plans can calculate their pension liabilities. The cost of paying pensions stretches decades into the future; those expected payments must be discounted in order to calculate the current funding cost. The higher the discount rate, the lower the current cost appears to be. Private-sector pension funds must use corporate-bond yields, currently low, as a discount rate; public-sector funds are allowed to use the expected rate of return on their investments. Many assume a rate of 7-7.5%, which makes the current cost of funding pensions look lower.

In the long run, however, accounting conventions cannot lower the actual cost of providing pensions. Many companies in the private sector have abandoned offering pensions linked to workers’ final salaries because of the increased expense. The CRR figures show that the cost has been steadily rising for public-sector funds as well. Back in 2002 they paid an average of 7.8% of payrolls to fund pensions; in 2020 that contribution is likely to be 19.7%, the highest so far this century. If a more conservative accounting treatment were used, closer to the private-sector approach, that rate would double. Even assuming public pension funds continue to use their current approach, the CRR estimates, the contribution may rise to 29.1% of pay by 2025 if markets are slow to recover.

This is a slow-motion crisis, precisely because the liabilities stretch out over many decades. But by 2025 eight funds may have only enough assets to cover less than four years of benefits, the CRR estimates; three of these funds—Chicago Municipal, Dallas Police and Fire, and New Jersey Teachers—will have a mere two years’ worth. If that happens, taxpayers will simply have to stump up more money to keep benefits flowing.

你要付税后的10%到25%。

- 事实上，日本能够借到如此多的钱，无论是现在，还是在较为平静的时期，都是因为其经济的其他部分支出如此之少。家庭和企业的高水平净储蓄 -- 即储蓄减去投资 -- 是一个长期存在的问题，代表着放弃的消费和未使用的经济能力。人口统计是部分原因。临近退休的人会存更多的钱，这肯定会阻碍公司在国内进行大规模投资。但企业节俭也代表着改革的失败和雄心壮志的失败；例如，无法充分利用国家的能力和对潜在移民的吸引力。日本已经向世界其他国家展示了一条看似可持续的政策制定路线。这并不意味着它值得遵循。

Japan probes the limits of economic policy

Including loan guarantees, fiscal support this year will amount to 40% of GDP

Jun 4th 2020 |


IN THE 1990S Japan seemed to offer a cautionary tale, an example of how feckless macroeconomic management could lead to troubles that other governments had long ago learnt to avoid. By the 2000s many economists came to see it as a harbinger. The path its leaders took in their efforts to lift weak growth, chronically low inflation and near-zero interest rates has been followed, repeatedly, by others in the rich world. Japan’s trailblazing has helped reveal that the limits to extreme policy are much farther away than economists had thought at first. This path-finding may well continue. At the end of May the government announced spending plans that will take total fiscal support for the economy this year to 40% of GDP. (Because the measures include loan guarantees, the budget deficit will probably amount to less than half of that.) The colossal figure might bolster queasy politicians elsewhere. But even as it does so, Japan’s fiscal radicalism exposes the limits to what government borrowing can achieve.

Japan’s experience of covid-19 has been remarkably mild. Despite its older population, a rash of cases early in the epidemic and a reluctance to impose strict lockdowns, its recorded infection rate is among the lowest in the rich world: just 134 per million, less even than in widely touted success stories like South Korea and New Zealand. It began its battle against the economic effects of the pandemic from an especially weak position, though. In most countries the coronavirus interrupted an economic boom, but Japan’s downturn began last year. An increase in consumption tax last autumn, part of an effort to repair the government’s finances, was followed by a drastic pullback in spending. Output shrank at an annual rate of 7.1% in the last quarter of 2019, compared with the previous three months, and by 3.4% in the first quarter of 2020. As in much of the rest of the world, the pace of contraction is likely to have been far more dramatic in the second quarter.

In the face of this bleak outlook, the Bank of Japan has continued to provide extraordinary monetary support. It has led efforts to revive the Japanese economy since Abe Shinzo, the prime minister, entered office in 2012. Its policy of yield-curve control, introduced in 2016, caps ten-year government-bond yields at 0% (the idea is gathering some support in America). Bonds with longer maturities yield less than 1%. Like many other central banks, the Bank of Japan has made emergency loans to vulnerable firms. Furthermore, it has bought about ¥62trn ($600bn) in assets, taking its already swollen balance-sheet to more than 110% of GDP.

More remarkable, though, has been the extent of fiscal support. In April Mr Abe’s government unveiled spending and guarantees worth ¥117trn, or roughly 20% of GDP, one of the most extreme responses to the pandemic. Perhaps feeling the pressure from a public that has become increasingly frustrated with the government’s handling of the crisis, Mr Abe announced another package in late May, which is roughly the same size as the first. As a consequence, the flow of red ink this year tests the limits of comprehension. Japan will issue government bonds worth roughly 40% of the size of its economy. All else being equal, borrowing could account for nearly 60% of the government’s revenue in 2020. A third spending programme cannot be ruled out. Soaring borrowing and falling output together promise to push Japan’s level of gross government debt well above the already vast level of about 240% of GDP.

Markets have yawned in response. Share prices in Japan have risen steadily from their lows in March—no doubt influenced by the central bank’s large-scale purchases of exchange-traded funds—but so have stock indexes in most of the rest of the rich world. Government-bond yields have barely stirred. The Bank of Japan’s yield cap partly explains that. But the central bank’s pace of government-bond purchases has slowed since March and April, amounting to just ¥5trn between May 20th and 31st. The yen has been surprisingly well behaved. At the moment, punters do not seem to have become more worried about Japan’s fiscal sustainability or the risk of inflation.

Investors’ indifference to such borrowing may come as a relief to other rich-world governments seeking to breathe life back into their economies. Since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, economists have become more comfortable with the notion that large-scale government borrowing is needed to fight economic weakness. But the awesome scale of debt issuance created by the response to the pandemic risked deterring some governments from borrowing as much as needed. Japan’s benign experience should provide some reassurance.

The Abe shoe drops

There is a risk of over-interpreting the lessons of Japan’s trailblazing, though. Debt issuance of 40% of GDP, tacitly financed, in large part, by central-bank easing, will probably influence debates around the world about the extent to which sustained borrowing can be used to fund generous social programmes. But all its stimulus notwithstanding, Japan’s economy is hardly roaring ahead. Its output per person, in real terms, is unexceptional by the standards of the rich world.

In fact, Japan has been able to borrow so much, now and in more placid times, because the rest of its economy spends so little. High levels of net saving by households and firms—that is, savings less investment—are a persistent problem, and represent forgone consumption and unused economic capacity. Demography is partly to blame. People approaching retirement save more, and that surely discourages companies from making large investments at home. But corporate thrift also represents a failure of reform, and of ambition; an inability to take full advantage of the country’s capabilities and its attractiveness to would-be immigrants, for instance. Japan has shown the rest of the world a policymaking route that is seemingly sustainable. That does not mean it is worth following.
