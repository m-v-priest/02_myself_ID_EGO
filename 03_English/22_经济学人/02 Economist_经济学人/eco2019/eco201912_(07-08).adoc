TWO CHINAS *collided* on a summer night in Beijing this year when “Little Zhang”, a high-flying(`=very successful 十分成功的`) young businessman, *was summoned*(`=to order sb to appear in court 传唤，传讯（出庭）/ to order sb to come to you 召唤`) for *questioning by* an elderly neighbour at his housing complex(`=a group of buildings of a similar type together in one place （类型相似的）建筑群`) 住宅区;居住综合体, and *asked to prove that* he is a legal resident of the city.

今年夏天的一个晚上，两个中国在北京发生了冲突。当时，一位成功的年轻商人“小张”, 在其住宅小区, 被一位年长的邻居传唤问讯，要求证明他是北京的合法居民。


[In the new China] where Mr Zhang *spends* most of his days -- a swaggering(`=to walk in an extremely proud and confident way 神气十足地走；大摇大摆地走`) country *rushing to become* a high-tech superpower -- the 31-year-old is a model citizen.

He recently *secured a job* with a prestigious(a.)(`=respected and admired as very important or of very high quality 有威望的；声誉高的`) technology company, *buoyed*(`=~ sb/sth (up) to keep sb/sth floating on water 使漂浮；使浮起 /to keep prices at a high or acceptable level 使（价格）上浮；使（价格）维持于较高水平`) by a master’s degree 硕士学位 from a Western university /and a stint(n.)(`=~ (as sth) a period of time that you spend working somewhere or doing a particular activity 从事某项工作（或活动）的时间`) with a foreign consultancy 咨询公司.

[In an older China], a bossy(`=always telling people what to do 好指挥人的；专横的`) place which *issues*(`=to give sth to sb, especially officially （正式）发给，供给 /to start a legal process against sb, especially by means of an official document （尤指通过正式文件）将…诉诸法律`) old men and women with red armbands(`=a cloth band worn around the arm as a sign of sth, for example that sb has an official position 臂章；臂带；袖章`) and *tasks*(`= ~ sb (with sth) ( formal ) to give sb a task to do 交给某人（任务）；派给某人（工作）`) them to sit outside apartment blocks, *snooping(`=~ (around/round sth) /~ (on sb) : to find out private things about sb, especially by looking secretly around a place 窥探；打探；探听`) on* all who pass, he is an object of suspicion.

新中国的一部分是, 张在新中国 -- 一个昂首阔步、急于成为高科技超级大国的国家 -- 度过了大半生. 31岁的他, 是一个模范公民。他最近在一家享有盛誉的科技公司找到了一份工作，这得益于他在一所西方大学得到的硕士学位, 和曾在一家外国咨询公司工作过一段时间。而旧中国的一部分是，这是一个专横的地方，老男人和老女人都戴着红袖章，被指派他们坐在公寓楼外面，监视所有经过的人. 小张就是被怀疑的对象之一。

Despite Mr Zhang’s enviable(a.)(`=something that is enviable is the sort of thing that is good and that other people want to have too 令人羡慕的；引起忌妒的`) job, he *is* legally an outsider in his new home of Haidian 海淀区, a district in Beijing’s north-west where technology firms *have sprung(`=spring 跳；跃；蹦`) up*(`=spring up : to appear or develop quickly and/or suddenly 迅速出现；突然兴起`) near elite 精英 universities.

*Born* in the neighbouring province of Hebei, Mr Zhang belongs to a tribe of white-collar migrants who *call* themselves, with mock-defiant(a.)(`=openly refusing to obey sb/sth, sometimes in an aggressive way 公然违抗的；反抗的；挑衅的`) pride, Beipiao 北漂, or Beijing drifters(`= a person who moves from one job or place to another with no real purpose 漂泊者；盲流`).

尽管张的工作令人羡慕，但在他的新家那里 -- 位于北京西北部海淀区, 那里的科技公司在精英大学旁, 如雨后春笋般涌现-- 从法律上讲，他是一个局外人。张出生在邻省河北，属于一个白领移民群体，他们自称“北漂”，带有一种嘲弄的自豪感。

Its members are hard to spot(v.)(`= to see or notice a person or thing, especially suddenly or when it is not easy to do so 看见；看出；注意到；发现`), but know who they are.

They are well-educated and *hail(`=下雹;雹；冰雹`) from*(`= to come from or have been born in a particular place 来自；出生于`) an urban area in another part of China. [*To build* secure lives in the capital] they *must pull off(`=to succeed in doing sth difficult 做成，完成（困难的事情）`) something hard* by *changing* their hukou, or household registration, *to make* Beijing their official home, or, *failing that*, by *obtaining* an employment-related residency permit.

北漂的成员很难认出，但可以知道他们是谁。他们受过良好的教育，来自中国另一个地区的城市。为了在首都建立安全的生活，他们必须努力做到一些困难的事情，来改变他们的户口，或户籍，使北京成为他们的真正居住地; 或者，如果做不到这一点，他们就必须获得与就业相关的居住证。

Mr Zhang’s interrogation(`=the act of interrogating someone. 审问`) was brief.

He *showed* his national and company identity-cards 身份证 *to* the “old granny” questioning him, and *insisted that* he was “definitely(`=a way of emphasizing that sth is true and that there is no doubt about it 肯定；没问题；当然；确实`) an honest citizen”, *merely prevented by* red tape(`=*red tape* : official rules that seem more complicated than necessary /and prevent things from being done quickly 繁文缛节；官僚作风`) *from* obtaining the right documents.

Hurry up and get those papers, she *commanded*. He *did not demur*(`= to say that you do not agree with sth or that you refuse to do sth 表示反对；提出异议；拒绝`), *having heard* the same demand *from* local police [not long before].

====
- demur => de-, 向下，强调。-mor, 延迟，词源同moratorium.原义为延迟，引申词义反对，拒绝。
====
对张先生的审讯很简短。他出示了他的国家和公司的身份证, 给询问他的“老奶奶”，并坚称他“绝对是一个诚实的公民”，只是因为繁琐的手续, 而无法获得正确的证件。快去拿那些文件，老奶奶命令道。他没有提出异议，因为不久前他从当地警察那里听到了同样的要求。


Educated urban-born outsiders like Mr Zhang *are better off*(`=*be better off* : to have more money 有较多钱；比较宽裕 / *be better off (doing sth)* : used to say that sb is/would be happier or more satisfied if they were in a particular position or did a particular thing （在某情况下）更幸福，更满意`) than working-class 工人阶级的；劳动阶级的 migrants from the countryside, many of whom *have been summarily(`=to give a summary of sth (= a statement of the main points) 总结；概括；概述`) expelled from* Beijing in recent years.

像张这样在城市出生、受过教育的外来人口，要比来自农村的工人阶级移民生活得更好。近年来，许多工人阶级移民被迅速驱逐出北京。
====

====

Still, when people like him *want to start a family*, their children *are* at the back of the queue for school places in Beijing.

They *are barred(`=bar : ~ sb (from sth/from doing sth) to ban or prevent sb from doing sth 禁止，阻止（某人做某事）`) [altogether(`=(used to emphasize sth) completely; in every way （用以强调）完全，全部`)] from* sitting(v.)(`=~ (for) sth ( BrE rather formal ) to do an exam 参加考试；应试`) university entrance examinations in the capital.

For Beipiao, to buy a home or even a car in Beijing *is* to plunge(v.) into(`=*plunge in /plunge into sth* : to jump into sth, especially with force （尤指用力地）投入，跳进`) a briar(`=a wild bush with thorns , especially a wild rose bush 多刺野灌木；（尤指）野蔷薇丛`) patch(`=a small piece of land, especially one used for growing vegetables or fruit 小块土地；（尤指）菜地，果园`) of regulations(`=an official rule made by a government or some other authority 章程；规章制度；规则；法规`).

尽管如此，当像他这样的人想要成家时，他们的孩子在北京想要上学, 只能在等待的队伍中排在最后。他们被禁止参加首都的大学入学考试。对北漂来说，在北京买房甚至买车, 都是陷入了一堆条条框框中。

-> I don't *altogether agree with you*. 我不完全同意你的意见。 +
-> It was *an altogether different situation*. 这完全是另外一种情况。

Chinese rulers *have long restricted* migration between rural and urban areas, and between big cities.

As the capital of the People’s Republic of China, Beijing *has endured*(`=to experience and deal with sth that is painful or unpleasant, especially without complaining 忍耐；忍受 /to continue to exist for a long time 持续；持久`) 70 years of unusually strict controls.

====
- endure => en-, 进入，使。-dur, 硬，坚持，词源同during, true, tree.

长期以来，中国统治者一直限制城乡之间以及大城市之间的移民。作为中华人民共和国的首都，北京经历了70年不同寻常的严格管制。


Yet political disciplines *are* now in tension 紧张局势（或关系、状况）;矛盾；对立 with another side to the city.

Beyond(`=more than sth 超出；除…之外`) its grey, hulking(`=very large or heavy, often in a way that causes you to feel nervous or afraid 很大的；很沉重的；大得吓人的`) ministries and Communist Party offices, it is has become an innovation hub, with an unrivalled(`=better or greater than any other 无与伦比的；无双的`) range of universities, venture(`=a business project or activity, especially one that involves taking risks （尤指有风险的）企业，商业，投机活动，经营项目`)-capital funds, technology firms and cultural enterprises.

然而，政治纪律现在已对这座城市的另一面, 产生了关系紧张。除了灰色、笨重的部委和共产党办公室，它已经成为了一个创新中心，拥有一系列无与伦比的大学、风险资本基金、技术公司和文化企业。
====
- hulking => 来自hulk,船骸，笨重的大船。引申词义巨大的。
- venture => 缩写自adventure,风险。 -vent-来 + -ure名词词尾 → 正要降临的
====

But at private dinners, drinks parties and off-the-record 非正式的；不留记录的；非公开的 coffees, Chaguan 茶馆栏目 *has heard from* bosses of multi-billion-dollar 几十亿美元 firms /and the founders of scrappy(a.)(`=not tidy and often of poor quality 不整洁的；糟糕的`) startups 新创办的 (小公司) *that* it is hard *to retain*(`=to keep sth; to continue to have sth 保持；持有；保留；继续拥有`) middle-ranking(`=having a responsible job or position, but not one of the most important 中层的；中级的`) staff in Beijing.

但在私人晚宴、酒会和非正式的咖啡会上，茶馆栏目从一些资产数十亿美元的公司老板, 和公司杂乱的初创公司创始人那里听说，在北京很难留住中层员工。

====


Many *report* that employees, especially those with children, *want to move to* cities with easier hukou rules, cheaper housing and a better quality of life, such as the southern boomtown of Shenzhen or the lakeside city of Hangzhou.

许多人表示，员工，尤其是有孩子的员工，希望搬到户口制度更宽松、住房更便宜、生活质量更好的城市，比如南方新兴城市深圳或湖畔城市杭州。

Beijing’s trouble retaining talent *raises a question* (that *applies to* China [more generally]): namely 即；也就是, are there limits to the flourishing of innovation and creativity in an autocratic 专制的；独裁的, controlling one-party state?

*Speak to* Beijing drifters(`= a person who moves from one job or place to another with no real purpose 漂泊者；盲流`), and *it* is not hard *to conclude that* the answer is yes.

中国政府留住人才的困难，提出了一个更普遍适用于中国的问题: 在一个专制的、控制欲强的一党制国家，创新和创造力的蓬勃发展, 是否存在极限? 与北京的流浪者交谈，不难得出结论，答案是肯定的。

The limits of the current system *are felt most sharply(`=in a way that clearly shows the differences between two things 鲜明地；明显地`) by* the middle tiers(`=
one of several levels in an organization or a system 阶层；等级`) of urban society, they say.

====
- sharply : +
Their experiences *contrast sharply(`=in a way that clearly shows the differences between two things 鲜明地；明显地`) with* those of other children. 他们的经历和其他孩子的形成鲜明的对比。
====

The rich *need not care about* hukou because they *can secure* foreign passports *for* their children and *send them to* private international schools in Beijing or overseas.

他们表示，当前体系的局限, 在城市社会的中层的感受中最为明显。富人不需要关心户口问题，因为他们可以为子女申请外国护照，并把他们送到北京或海外的私立国际学校。


As for low-income migrant workers, they typically *leave* their children *with* grandparents back home in villages and townships.

*It is* the aspirational(`=wanting very much to achieve success in your career /or to improve your social status and standard of living 渴望成功的；一心想提高社会地位和生活水平的`) middle *that* suffers(v.), interviewees(`=the person who answers the questions in an interview 参加面试者；接受采访者`) say.

There are other ways in which such folk *are left out*(`=*leave sb/sth out (of sth)* : to not include or mention sb/sth in sth 不包括；不提及 /If you *leave* someone or something *out* of an activity, collection, discussion, or group, you do not include them in it. 排除`).

至于低收入的农民工，他们通常会把孩子留在农村和乡镇的祖父母家里。受访者说，受影响的是有抱负的中产阶级。这些人被排除在外的方式还有很多。

Risk-taking hipsters(`= they are very fashionable, often in a way that you think is silly. 赶时髦的人`) *are still drawn to* Beijing, as well as those who *do not care about* having children or *making much money* -- the so-called “Buddha-style young” *drawn to* Beijing’s surprisingly irreverent(a.)(`=not showing respect to sb/sth that other people usually respect 不敬的；不恭的`), gritty(`=含沙砾的；沙砾般的 /showing the courage and determination to continue doing sth difficult or unpleasant 有勇气的；坚定的；坚毅的; /showing sth unpleasant as it really is （对消极事物的描述）逼真的，真实的，活生生的`)-yet(`=despite what has just been said 但是；然而`)-arty(a.)(`= seeming or wanting to be very artistic or interested in the arts 附庸风雅的；似乎爱好艺术的`) subculture （某群体特有的）亚文化行为观念， 次文化.

但冒险的潮人仍然被吸引到北京，如同那些不关心生孩子或赚大钱的人 ——所谓的“佛系青年”，他们被北京令人惊讶的不恭敬、粗犷但又充满艺术气息的亚文化, 所吸引。

The city *also attracts* conservative-minded graduates *willing to work for* state-owned firms that *pay badly*, but *offer easy access to* hukou and work permits(`=an official document that gives sb the right to do sth, especially for a limited period of time 许可证，特许证（尤指限期的）`).

这座城市也吸引了一些思想保守的毕业生，他们愿意到薪水较低的国有企业工作, 因为那里能容易获得户口, 和工作许可。

The losers *are* those who *fall* between those extremes(`=the greatest or highest degree of sth 极端；极度；极限 /a feeling, situation, way of behaving, etc. that is as different as possible from another or is opposite to it 极端不同的感情（或境况、行为方式等）；完全相反的事物`): people who *want to work for* the private sector and *build families*.

输家是那些介于这两个极端之间的人:那些希望在北京的私营部门工作, 并想建立家庭的人。


Beijing drifters *are* masters *at hustling(v.)(`=to make sb move quickly by pushing them in a rough aggressive way 推搡；猛推 / If you hustle, you go somewhere or do something as quickly as you can. 快速行进; 赶快做`) around* bureaucratic 官僚主义的 obstacles.

A former journalist from central China, now *working for* a big technology company, *describes* friends who *took low-paid jobs* with a party newspaper, then a year’s sabbatical （尤指供大学教师进行学术研究或旅行的）公休假，休假 *to pursue* a master’s degree overseas -- a double-manoeuvre(`=a movement performed with care and skill 细致巧妙的移动；机动动作 /a clever plan, action or movement that is used to give sb an advantage 策略；手段；花招；伎俩`) that *earned them* hukou in Beijing on their return.

北京的“漂移族”是绕过官僚障碍的高手。一位来自华中地区的前记者，现在为一家大型科技公司工作，他描述了他的一些朋友，他们在一家党报做低薪工作，然后休假一年去国外攻读硕士学位-- 这是一种双重策略，让他们回国后获得了北京的户口。


Another friend *worked as* a village official in the rural outskirts 郊区，市郊 of Beijing after graduating. A hukou was his reward.

The journalist’s child, if she has one, *will live with* her mother-in-law(`=the mother of your husband or wife 婆婆；岳母`) and *be educated* in the port city of Tianjin, her husband’s home town, which *has* good schools and *is* a less competitive place than Beijing for aspirants(n.)(`=a person with a strong desire to achieve a position of importance or to win a competition 有抱负的人；有雄心壮志的人`) to university.

另一位朋友毕业后在北京郊区的农村当村官。户口是他的报酬。这位记者的孩子，如果她有孩子的话，孩子将和婆婆一起生活，并在丈夫的家乡天津接受教育。那里有很好的学校，对有志上大学的人来说，天津的竞争没有北京那么激烈。

A place *to find* good jobs, more than a good life

Politics *stops* some firms moving. A film producer *notes that* internet and entertainment companies *must stay close to* government regulators and censors. But he *adds*: “If conditions allowed, all companies *would consider* moving out of Beijing.”

Other cities *have widely discussed* limitations. Shenzhen *is called* a cultural desert. Shanghai *is plagued(`=to cause pain or trouble to sb/sth over a period of time 给…造成长时间的痛苦（或麻烦）；困扰；折磨；使受煎熬 /瘟疫`) by* snobbish(`=thinking that having a high social class is very important; feeling that you are better than other people because you are more intelligent or like things that many people do not like 势利的；自命不凡的`) cliques(`=a small group of people who spend their time together and do not allow others to join them 派系；私党；小集团；小圈子`).

政治阻碍了一些公司的发展(/政治阻止了一些公司的搬迁)。一位电影制片人指出，互联网和娱乐公司必须与政府监管机构和审查机构保持密切联系。但他补充称:“如果条件允许，所有公司都会考虑迁出北京。其他城市也广泛讨论了这种限制。深圳被称为文化沙漠。上海充斥着势力集团。
====
- snobbish => snob,势利眼，-ish,形容词后缀。nobilitate（nobility，贵族）
- clique => 拟声词，模仿关门的声音，形成小圈子。
====

Beijing *may be* a glorious(`=deserving or bringing great fame and success 值得称道的；光荣的；荣耀的`) “hodgepodge”(`=hotchpotch : a number of things mixed together without any particular order or reason 杂乱无章的一堆东西；大杂烩`) of clever people from all over China, as a financier(`=a person who lends large amounts of money to businesses 金融家；理财家`) *describes* it. Nowhere(`=not in or to any place 无处；哪里都不`) *is* as exciting for a first job.

Still, every Beijing drifter *has* friends planning an escape, especially those who *lack hukou* in the capital. “Beijing *is not* a good place *to fulfil their dreams*,” *explains* one citizen of the new, innovative(`=introducing or using new ideas, ways of doing sth, etc. 引进新思想的；采用新方法的；革新的；创新的`) China. The old China *had little time for* individual dreamers. In Beijing those two worlds of creativity and control *increasingly collide*.

====
- hotchpotch => 来自古法语hochepot,热罐，*来自hocher,摇，pot,罐子*。原指把肉，草药，香料，酒和其它调料加在一起炖的炖锅菜，引申词义大杂烩，杂乱无章。
====
正如一位金融家所描述的那样，北京可能是一个由来自全国各地的聪明人组成的“大杂烩”。对于第一份工作来说，没有哪个地方比这里(北京)更令人兴奋了。尽管如此，每一个北京的漂泊者都有朋友计划逃离，尤其是那些没有北京户口的人。“北京不是实现他们梦想的好地方，”一位属于新中国部分的公民解释道。旧中国部分, 几乎没有时间给个人梦想家。 在北京，创造力和控制力这两个世界, 日益碰撞。

== 07. China’s discriminatory hukou system plagues white-collar workers, too 纯净版

China’s discriminatory hukou system *plagues* white-collar workers, too

It *is* harming efforts *to turn* Beijing *into* a hub of high-tech innovation

Dec 12th 2019 |


TWO CHINAS *collided* on a summer night in Beijing this year when “Little Zhang”, a high-flying young businessman, *was summoned* for *questioning by* an elderly neighbour at his housing complex, and *asked* to prove(v.) that he *is* a legal resident of the city. In the new China where Mr Zhang *spends most of his days* -- a swaggering country *rushing to become* a high-tech superpower -- the 31-year-old is a model citizen. He recently *secured a job* with a prestigious technology company, *buoyed by* a master’s degree from a Western university /and a stint with a foreign consultancy. In an older China, a bossy place which *issues* old men and women with red armbands /and *tasks* them *to sit outside* apartment blocks, *snooping on* all who *pass*, he is an object of suspicion.

Despite Mr Zhang’s enviable job, he *is* legally an outsider in his new home of Haidian, a district in Beijing’s north-west where technology firms *have sprung up* near elite universities. Born in the neighbouring province of Hebei, Mr Zhang *belongs to* a tribe of white-collar migrants who *call themselves*, [with mock-defiant pride], Beipiao, or Beijing drifters. Its members *are hard to spot*, but *know* who they are. They *are* well-educated and *hail from* an urban area in another part of China. [*To build secure lives* in the capital] they *must pull off something hard* by *changing* their hukou, or household registration, *to make Beijing* their official home, or, *failing that*, by *obtaining* an employment-related residency permit. Mr Zhang’s interrogation *was* brief. He *showed* his national and company identity-cards *to* the “old granny” *questioning* him, and *insisted that* he *was* “definitely an honest citizen”, *merely prevented by* red tape *from obtaining* the right documents. *Hurry up* and *get those papers*, she *commanded*. He *did not demur*, *having heard* the same demand *from* local police not long before.

Educated urban-born outsiders like Mr Zhang *are better off* than working-class migrants from the countryside, many of whom *have been summarily expelled from Beijing* in recent years. Still, when people like him *want to start a family*, their children *are* at the back of the queue for school places in Beijing. They *are barred altogether from* sitting university entrance examinations in the capital. For Beipiao, `主` *to buy* a home or even a car in Beijing `系` *is to plunge into* a briar patch of regulations.

Chinese rulers *have long restricted migration* between rural and urban areas, and between big cities. As the capital of the People’s Republic of China, Beijing *has endured 70 years of* unusually strict controls. Yet political disciplines *are* now *in tension with* another side to the city. Beyond its grey, hulking ministries and Communist Party offices, it is *has become* an innovation hub, with *an unrivalled range of* universities, venture-capital funds, technology firms and cultural enterprises. But [at private dinners, drinks parties and off-the-record coffees], Chaguan *has heard from* bosses of multi-billion-dollar firms /and the founders of scrappy startups *that* {*it* is hard *to retain* middle-ranking staff in Beijing}. Many *report that* employees, especially those with children, *want to move to cities* with easier hukou rules, cheaper housing and a better quality of life, such as the southern boomtown of Shenzhen or the lakeside city of Hangzhou.

`主` Beijing’s trouble (retaining talent) `谓` *raises a question* (that *applies to* China more generally): namely, *are there limits to* the flourishing of innovation and creativity in an autocratic, controlling one-party state? *Speak to* Beijing drifters, and *it* is not hard *to conclude that* the answer is yes.

The city also *attracts* conservative-minded graduates *willing to work for* state-owned firms that *pay badly*, but *offer easy access to* hukou and work permits. The losers *are* those who *fall* between those extremes: people who *want to work for* the private sector and *build families*.

The journalist’s child, if she *has* one, *will live with* her mother-in-law and *be educated* in the port city of Tianjin, her husband’s home town, which *has* good schools and *is* a less competitive place than Beijing *for* aspirants(n.) to university.

A place to find good jobs, more than a good life

Politics *stops* some firms moving. A film producer *notes that* internet and entertainment companies *must stay close to* government regulators and censors. But he *adds*: “If conditions *allowed*, all companies *would consider moving out of* Beijing.” Other cities *have widely discussed* limitations. Shenzhen *is called* a cultural desert.

Lucy, a British woman in her early 40s, *knew that* something was wrong. Two years before she had been training at the gym five times a week. Now she could barely find the energy to exercise at all *thanks to* chronic(`= lasting for a long time; difficult to cure or get rid of 长期的；慢性的；难以治愈（或根除）的`) insomnia(`=the condition of being unable to sleep 失眠（症）`), a new affliction(`=pain and suffering or sth that causes it 折磨；痛苦`).

Her demeanour(`=the way that sb looks or behaves 外表；风度；行为；举止`) *had shifted from* one of cheeriness 开心，快活 *to* constant anxiety. Her work and her home life were suffering as a result.

这是多种因素的结合: 一种不寻常的沮丧感; 不断的遗忘; 月经周期不规律。露西，一个四十出头的英国女人，知道有些事情不对劲。两年前，她每周在健身房训练五次。现在，由于慢性失眠症(一种新的折磨)的原因，她几乎没有运动的力量。她的举止已经从高兴变成了持续的焦虑。她的工作和家庭生活因此受到影响。

*Unsure* what was causing(v.) these changes, she *visited* her doctor. The physician  医师；（尤指）内科医生 *blamed* stress. She suggested Lucy return in a year. Frustrated, Lucy turned to the internet. Her research *led her to believe that* she was entering the transition into menopause(`=the time during which a woman gradually stops menstruating , usually at around the age of 50 绝经期；（妇女的）更年期`).

====
- menopause => 来自拉丁语menopausis,停经，来自 *menses,月经，词源同moon, pausis,暂停，停止，词源同pause.* 引申词义更年期。

- ovary => 词源同egg. 用于指卵巢。
- insomnia => in-,不，非，-somn,睡觉，词源同somnolent,somnambulist.即没法睡觉，引申词义失眠。
====

由于不确定是什么引起了这些变化，她去看了医生。医生将其归咎于压力。她建议露西一年后回来再检查。沮丧之下，露西转向了互联网。她的探究使她相信她正进入更年期。更年期是女性生命中期的一段时间--可能从40岁出头开始，此时女性体内的雌激素、黄体酮和睾酮等激素水平急剧下降。这最终会导致她的卵巢停止排卵，月经停止。一年后没有月经出现，妇女即被认为是更年期。更年期的症状包括潮热、抑郁、疼痛、失眠、焦虑和短暂的记忆丧失。

Lucy’s experience is unremarkable(`=ordinary; not special or remarkable in any way 一般的；平常的；平凡的；平庸的;不值得注意的`) in two ways. First, every woman *experiences* menopause. Second, doctors all over the world *often fail to provide* them *with* treatment that could alleviate their symptoms. Research *suggests that* 70-80% of women *experience symptoms* and for just over a quarter *they are debilitating*(`=to make sb's body or mind weaker （使身心）衰弱，衰竭，虚弱`). On average they *last* for seven and a half years.


露西的经历在两个方面都很平常。首先，每个女人都会经历更年期。其次，世界各地的医生经常都无法为她们提供能够减轻症状的治疗。研究表明，70-80%的女性会出现症状，超过四分之一的女性会感到虚弱无力。她们平均持续7年半。


And yet doctors *often encourage* women *to grin*(`=to smile widely 露齿而笑；咧着嘴笑；龇着牙笑`) and *bear* it. Some *suggest* eating well and exercising more, which *may ease*(`=to become or to make sth less unpleasant, painful, severe, etc. （使）宽慰；减轻；缓解`) the symptoms.

Some *prescribe*(`=to tell sb to take a particular medicine or have a particular treatment; to write a prescription for a particular medicine, etc. 给…开（药）；让…采用（疗法）；开（处方）`) antidepressants(`=a drug used to treat depression 抗抑郁药`) or anti-epileptics(`=suffers from epilepsy 患癫痫的`), which *do not treat* the cause 原因；起因 of the problem.

A cheap, effective alternative *exists*: hormone-replacement therapy (HRT)(`= If a woman has *hormone replacement therapy*, she takes the hormone oestrogen 雌激素, usually in order to control the symptoms of menopause. The abbreviation is often used. 激素替代治疗`).

But as a result of misinformation (常指故意提供的) 虚假消息 and scaremongering(n.)(`=deliberately spreading worrying stories to try and frighten people. 散布骇人听闻的消息`), millions of women *are missing out on* it.

然而，医生们经常鼓励女性露齿而笑并忍耐。一些人建议吃得好，多运动，这样可以缓解症状。有些医生会开抗抑郁药或抗癫痫药，但这些药并不能治疗癫痫。有一种廉价而有效的替代疗法:激素替代疗法(HRT)。但由于错误的信息和危言耸听，数以百万计的妇女错过了它。

Menopause 绝经期；（妇女的）更年期 *harms* women’s bones, brains, hearts and immune systems.

It *is associated with* a higher risk of osteoporosis 骨质疏松；骨质疏松症 and fragility 脆弱性;易碎性 fractures(`=a break in a bone or other hard material （指状态）骨折，断裂，折断，破裂`), increased abdominal 腹部的 fat 脂肪, and a heightened risk of *contracting*(`=to get an illness 感染（疾病）；得（病）`) diabetes 糖尿病, *explains* Susan Davis, a professor of women’s health at Monash University in Australia.

更年期会损害女性的骨骼、大脑、心脏和免疫系统。澳大利亚莫纳什大学(Monash University)的女性健康教授苏珊•戴维斯(Susan Davis)解释说，肥胖会增加骨质疏松和脆性骨折的风险，增加腹部脂肪，并增加患糖尿病的风险。


The hormonal 荷尔蒙的，激素的 changes of menopause *also seem to make women age(v.)(`=to become older 变老`) faster*.

Oestrogen 雌激素 *is particularly important* in *maintaining* the health of women’s hearts.

[Before menopause] women *have* fewer heart attacks than men. [After menopause] the risk *increases* as the elasticity(`=the quality that sth has of being able to stretch and return to its original size and shape (= of being elastic ) 弹性；弹力`) of the coronary(a.)冠状动脉的 arteries 动脉 *decreases*(`=to become or make sth become smaller in size, number, etc. （使大小、数量等）减少，减小，降低`) *along with* their oestrogen levels.

- coronary => 词源同corolla, 花冠。解剖学术语，因心脏上面的血管形似花冠而得名。
====
更年期的荷尔蒙变化, 似乎也会让女性衰老得更快。当通过血液中的基因变化, 来测量年龄时，它们会使细胞衰老速度加快约6%。人们怀疑与更年期相关的失眠可能是造成这一现象的原因。雌激素在维持女性心脏健康方面尤为重要。绝经前女性的心脏病发作比男性少。绝经后，随着冠状动脉弹性的降低, 和雌激素水平的降低，患病风险增加。

In 1966 Robert Wilson, a doctor, *wrote* a book *called* “Feminine(`=having the qualities or appearance considered to be typical of women; connected with women （指气质或外貌）女性特有的，女性的，妇女的`) Forever”.

1966年，医生罗伯特·威尔逊写了一本名为《永远女性化》的书。在这本书中，他认为女性在绝经后失去荷尔蒙, 会导致一种严重的、痛苦的、常常是致命的疾病，即雌激素缺乏症。他建议，解决方案是定期服用雌激素补充剂。它们将保护女性的青春、性感和婚姻。


The book was divisive(a.)(`= causing people to be split into groups that disagree with or oppose each other 造成不和的；引起分歧的；制造分裂的`).

这本书引起了争议。一些女性接受服用雌激素作为一种战胜时间摧残的方法。另一些人则反对，他们认为这是试图将女性生命中的一个自然阶段病态化。

Nonetheless(`=`) despite this fact 尽管如此, by the turn of the millennium(`=a period of 1 000 years, especially as calculated before or after the birth of Christ 一千年，千年期（尤指公元纪年）`) hormone-replacement therapy *was* extremely popular.

In America [before 2001] some 20% of post-menopausal 绝经后的 women *used it* at some point.

By then a synthetic(`=artificial; made by combining chemical substances rather than being produced naturally by plants or animals 人造的；（人工）合成的`) form of progesterone 孕酮；黄体酮 *was being administered*(`=to give drugs, medicine, etc. to sb 给予，施用（药物等） / to make sure that sth is done fairly and in the correct way 施行；执行`) *alongside* oestrogen; it *had been shown*(`=to make sth clear; to prove sth 表明；证明 /to prove that you can do sth or are sth 证明；表明`) to protect women from an increased risk of uterine(a.)有关子宫的 cancer *caused by* giving oestrogen 雌激素 [on its own].

尽管如此，在世纪之交，激素替代疗法还是非常流行。在2001年以前，美国有20%的绝经后妇女使用过它。那时, 一种合成形式的黄体酮, 与雌激素一起使用; 它已经被证明可以保护妇女避免因单独注射雌激素而增加的患子宫癌的风险。

The benefits of HRT *seemed clear*. Most immediately(`= closely and directly 紧接地；直接地`), it *offered* relief(n.)(`= *~ (from/of sth)* the act of removing or reducing pain, anxiety, etc. （焦虑、痛苦等的）减轻，消除，缓和`) from the miserable(`=very unhappy or uncomfortable 痛苦的；非常难受的；可怜的`) symptoms of menopause.

[In the longer term] it *reduced* the risk of osteoporosis 骨质疏松；骨质疏松症 (which *rises* after menopause) and therefore the risk of bone fractures.

Women *liked that* it seemed to stop their skin thinning (probably because it *boosts* the levels of collagen(`=a protein found in skin and bone, sometimes injected into the body, especially the face, to improve its appearance 胶原蛋白，胶原（存在于皮肤和骨骼的蛋白质，可通过注射进行美容等）`), a protein).

It *was thought* to reduce(v.) the risk of cognitive(a.)(`=connected with mental processes of understanding 认知的；感知的；认识的`) decline.

But most importantly, studies *suggested that* it *prevented* the onset(n.)(`= the beginning of sth, especially sth unpleasant 开端，发生，肇始（尤指不快的事件）`) of cardiovascular(a.)(`=connected with the heart and the blood vessels (= the tubes that carry blood around the body) 心血管的`) disease -- one of the biggest killers of women.

====
- collagen => coll, 胶，词源同cling, glue. -gen, 产生，词源同antigen, generate.
====
HRT的好处似乎很明显。最直接的是，它缓解了更年期的痛苦症状。从长期来看，它降低了骨质疏松症(绝经后会增加)的风险，因此也降低了骨折的风险。女性还喜欢它似乎能阻止皮肤变薄(可能是因为它能提高胶原蛋白的水平)。它被认为可以降低认知能力下降的风险。但最重要的是，研究表明，它可以预防心血管疾病 -- 女性的最大杀手之一。


The great hormone scare(`= a situation in which a lot of people are anxious or frightened about sth 恐慌；恐惧`)

荷尔蒙恐慌

By 1997 a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association *concluded that* HRT *extended* life expectancy *for* postmenopausal(a.)（妇女）绝经后的 women *by* as much as three years. It *had become* a standard treatment. But then a bombshell(`=an event or a piece of news which is unexpected and usually unpleasant 出乎意料的事情，意外消息（常指不幸）`) *dropped*.

到1997年，《美国医学会杂志》上的一篇报告得出结论，荷尔蒙替代疗法, 使绝经后妇女的预期寿命延长了3年。这已成为一种标准的治疗方法。但接着一颗重磅炸弹落了下来。


[In 2002] `主` the results of a large randomised(a.)随机化的 trial(`=the process of testing the ability, quality or performance of sb/sth, especially before you make a final decision about them （对能力、质量、性能等的）试验，试用`) *conducted by* America’s National Institutes of Health, *known as* the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), `谓` *were rushed(`=~ (sb) (into sth/into doing sth) : to do sth or to make sb do sth without thinking about it carefully （使）仓促行事，匆忙行事，做事草率`) into* publication.

It *concluded that* taking oestrogen with synthetic progesterone *increased* women’s risk of breast （女子的）乳房 cancer, heart attacks, strokes 中风 and blood clots(`=a lump that is formed when blood dries or becomes thicker 血凝块；血块`).

Women *were told that* the dangers of HRT *mostly outweighed*(`=to be greater or more important than sth 重于；大于； (在重要性或意义上) 超过`) any benefits.

2002年，由美国国立卫生研究院进行的一项大型随机试验，即妇女健康倡议(WHI)的结果, 被迅速发表。研究得出的结论是，将雌激素与人造黄体酮一起服用, 会增加女性患乳腺癌、心脏病、中风和血栓的风险。妇女们被告知，荷尔蒙替代疗法的危险远远大于益处。

这一发现颠覆了数十年来的医疗实践。最后，有消息称，威尔逊先生在写他的促激素书时，从生产雌激素的惠氏-艾尔斯特公司收受了资金。HRT从一种神奇的药物, 变成了渴望利润的制药公司兜售的杀手药丸。


[Within six years] fewer than 5% of American post-menopausal women *were taking* it. [In Western countries] use of HRT *increased rapidly* during the 1990s but *halved*(`=halve : to reduce by a half; to make sth reduce by a half （使）减半`) in the early 2000s. To this day 直到今天,至今 doctors *are reluctant to prescribe* hormones *to* their patients.

六年内，只有不到5%的美国绝经后妇女, 服用此药。在西方国家，20世纪90年代, HRT的使用迅速增加，但在21世纪初减少了一半。直到今天，医生还不愿意给病人开激素处方。

But `主` the first conclusions of the WHI(`=妇女健康倡议（Women's Health Initiative）`) study, on which so much antipathy(n.)(`=a strong feeling of dislike 厌恶；反感`) to HRT *is still based*, `谓` *were almost entirely wrong*.

The study *had hoped to look at* strategies  策略 for *preventing* heart disease, cancer and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.

但是，WHI研究的第一个结论几乎是完全错误的，而对激素替代疗法的许多反感, 仍然是基于此第一个结论而做出。这项研究, 希望着眼于探寻策略, 用来预防绝经后妇女会患心脏病、癌症和骨质疏松症。


Avrum Bluming, an oncologist 肿瘤学家；肿瘤医师 and co-author 合著者 of a recent book, “Oestrogen *Matters*”, *says that* instead of *recruiting*(`=to find new people to join a company, an organization, the armed forces, etc. 吸收（新成员）；征募（新兵）`) healthy women in their late 40s and early 50s, who *were entering* menopause, the median age was 63.

These older recruits(n.)(`=a person who joins an organization, a company, etc. 新成员`) *were* already unhealthy. Half *were* obese(a.)(`=very fat, in a way that is not healthy 臃肿的；虚胖的；病态肥胖的`). Nearly 50% *were* current or past smokers and more than a third *had been treated(`=~ sb (for sth) (with sth) : to give medical care or attention to a person, an illness, an injury, etc. 医疗；医治；治疗`) for* high blood pressure.

阿夫鲁姆·布鲁明(Avrum Bluming)是一位肿瘤学家，也是最近出版的一本书《雌激素很重要》(Oestgen Matters)的合著者。他说，与招募即将进入更年期的40多岁和50岁出头的健康女性不同，WHI招募的人, 他们的中位年龄是63岁。这些年纪较大的被试已经不健康了。一半的人肥胖。近50%的人现在或过去是吸烟者，超过三分之一的人曾因高血压而接受过治疗。

The women included in the study *probably suffered from* atherosclerosis(n.)动脉粥样硬化 -- where plaque(n.)(`=斑块 /a flat piece of stone, metal, etc., usually with a name and dates on, attached to a wall in memory of a person or an event （纪念性的）匾牌，匾额；纪念匾`) *builds up* inside arteries(`=artery 动脉`) and *makes* heart disease *more likely* -- when it *began*, says Mr Bluming.

`主` What the analysis(n.)(`=the detailed study or examination of sth in order to understand more about it; the result of the study （对事物的）分析，分析结果`) in 2002 actually showed `系` *was that* {`主` offering(v.) older and more unhealthy women 双宾 HRT `系` *was* a bad idea}. *It said nothing about* the women *at whom* the treatment *was aimed*.

Bluming先生说，参与研究的女性, 可能患有动脉粥样硬化，即斑块在动脉内积聚,并使心脏病更有可能发生。实际上，2002年的分析表明，为年龄较大、身体较差的妇女提供荷尔蒙替代疗法, 是个坏主意。它没有提及这种治疗方法应该针对哪类妇女。

There were other problems.

The WHI study *almost completely excluded(`=~ sth (from sth) to deliberately not include sth in what you are doing or considering 不包括；不放在考虑之列;把…排斥在外`) from* the trial women who *were experiencing* menopausal symptoms, *fearing that* those given the placebo(n.)(`=a substance that has no physical effects, given to patients who do not need medicine but think that they do, or used when testing new drugs （给无实际治疗需要者的）安慰剂；（试验药物用的）无效对照剂`) *would abandon* the trial when their symptoms *were not relieved*(`=to remove or reduce an unpleasant feeling or pain 解除，减轻，缓和（不快或痛苦）`).

But these *are* the women who *would be expected to benefit most from* the preventive(a.)(`=intended to try to stop sth that causes problems or difficulties from happening 预防性的；防备的`) effects of HRT.

18世纪的英国名医William Cullen大力宣扬“安慰疗法”，并用placebo来表示“安慰剂”
====
还有其他问题。WHI研究几乎完全排除了有更年期症状的妇女，因为他们担心, 那些服用安慰剂的妇女, 在症状没有缓解的情况下, 就会放弃试验。但这些妇女, 其实是有可能从激素替代疗法的预防效果中, 获益最多的。

Recent research *suggests that* hot flushes and night sweats 夜间盗汗 *are associated with* an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

最近的研究表明，潮热和盗汗, 与心脏病和中风的风险增加有关。

A careful reanalysis 重新分析 of the studies *showed that* women in their 50s *were* actually 31% less likely to die *in the five to seven years* that they *were taking* hormones.

For women who *have had their uterus 子宫 removed* or who *start menopause* before the age of 45, it *is* life-saving, *preventing* osteoporosis and heart disease for as long as 18 years.

There is a tiny increase *in the rates of* breast cancer among HRT-users after five years of the treatment. *This was lower* than the risk from *working as* a flight attendant(`=a person whose job is to serve or help people in a public place 服务员；侍者`).

现在很清楚，激素替代疗法, 对进入更年期的妇女的长期益处是显著的。对这些研究进行仔细地重新分析后, 表明，在服用激素的五到七年内，50多岁的女性的死亡率实际上降低了31%。对于那些已经摘除子宫, 或在45岁之前进入更年期的女性来说，这是一种救命的方法，可以预防骨质疏松症和心脏病, 长达18年之久。虽然接受荷尔蒙替代疗法治疗5年后，乳腺癌的发病率略有上升, 但这比做空乘的风险还要低。

But Ms Davis and others *worry that* its conclusions *are not reliable*. Moreover any increase in risk *must be weighed(`=weigh : ~ sth (up) /~ (up) sth (against sth) : to consider sth carefully before making a decision 认真考虑；权衡；斟酌`) against* that of developing other diseases.

今年早些时候发表在英国医学杂志《柳叶刀》(Lancet)上的一项研究，再次引发了关于激素疗法会导致乳腺癌风险水平的争议。但是戴维斯女士和其他人担心, 其结论不可靠。此外，任何风险的增加, 都必须与发展其他疾病的风险, 进行权衡。


Taking HRT *reduces* the mortality(`=the number of deaths in a particular situation or period of time 死亡数量；死亡率; /a death 死亡`) of women aged 50-59 by *at least* 20% and *as much as* 40%, mostly because they *suffer* fewer heart attacks.

One in 25 of all women *will die of* breast cancer; one in three *will die of* coronary heart disease; and one in six *will die of* a stroke. Around 90% of women with breast cancer *survive it* in rich countries.

If women *are* on HRT *at the time of* their breast-cancer diagnosis(n.)(`=the act of discovering or identifying the exact cause of an illness or a problem 诊断；（问题原因的）判断`) they *are* less likely to die from the disease.

`主` *Weighing such risks* `系` is part of the decision about *whether to embark on*(`=EMBARK ON/UPON STH : to start to do sth new or difficult 从事，着手，开始（新的或艰难的事情）; /embark : to get onto a ship; to put sth onto a ship 上船；装船`) a course of HRT.

====
- mortality => 来自mortal,死亡的，致命的。引申词义死亡率，死亡数量。
- embark => em-, 进入，使。bark, 船，驳船，同barge。
====
接受激素替代疗法, 可使50-59岁女性的死亡率, 至少降低20%，最多降低40%，这主要是因为她们患心脏病的几率更低。每25名妇女中就有一人会死于乳腺癌; 三分之一的人会死于冠心病;六分之一的人会死于中风。在富裕国家，大约90%的乳腺癌患者能存活下来。如果妇女在诊断乳腺癌时, 使用激素替代疗法，她们死于乳腺癌的可能性就会降低。权衡这些风险, 是决定是否采用激素替代疗法的一部分。


In addition to the flaws in the structure of the WHI study, a change in the versions of hormones used in HRT *explains* the shifting scientific consensus(n.)(`=an opinion that all members of a group agree with 一致的意见；共识`) on the treatment’s effects.

The synthetic(`=artificial; made by combining chemical substances rather than being produced naturally by plants or animals 人造的；（人工）合成的`) form of progesterone 孕酮；黄体酮 used in the WHI *probably triggered*(`=~ sth (off) : to make sth happen suddenly 发动；引起；触发 /（枪的）扳机`) cardiovascular(`=connected with the heart and the blood vessels (= the tubes that carry blood around the body) 心血管的`) problems.

除了WHI研究结构上的缺陷，荷尔蒙替代疗法中使用的激素版本的变化, 能解释科学上对治疗效果的共识的转变。WHI中使用的黄体酮的合成形式, 可能会引发心血管问题。而现在许多女性使用的, 与雌激素补充剂一起服用的黄体酮, 则被认为不太可能引发心血管问题。


No long-term clinical(`=relating to the examination and treatment of patients and their illnesses 临床的；临床诊断的`) trials of this specific combination of hormones *have been carried out*(`=*CARRY STH OUT* : to do sth that you have said you will do or have been asked to do 履行；实施；执行；落实`).

But, in theory, it *should bring* all the benefits of oestrogen *found* in the WHI trial, with none of the risks of *taking synthetic progesterone*.

目前还没有针对这种特定的激素组合, 所进行的长期的临床试验。但从理论上讲，它应该能带来WHI试验中发现的雌激素的所有好处，而不会有服用合成黄体酮会带来的风险。

In the absence of such studies, HRT *remains* in medical limbo(`=a situation in which you are not certain what to do next, cannot take action, etc., especially because you are waiting for sb else to make a decision （尤指因等待他人作决定）处于不定状态`).

And so women in their late 40s and early 50s *are losing out*(`=*LOSE OUT (ON STH)* : to not get sth you wanted or feel you should have 得不到（需要或觉得应有的东西）`).

在缺乏此类研究的情况下，HRT仍处于医学上悬而未决的状态。因此，40多岁和50多岁的女性正在失去机会。开始进行激素替代疗法, 以获得其全部好处(包括抵抗认知衰退的影响)的机会, 窗口期可能只有两到三年。

露西的医生对她看的病(更年期带来的身体难受)淡然处之后，她的症状加重了。她在网上的研究让她确信自己正在过渡到更年期，于是她花钱去验血。结果证实了她的怀疑，即她的荷尔蒙水平是问题所在。医生给她开了个性化剂量的三种荷尔蒙：雌激素贴片、微粒化黄体酮和睾丸素。不到三天，她的潮热就停止了，她睡得很安稳，她的情绪也恢复了快乐的平衡。她觉得自己是“超人”。

但她的大团圆结局并不常见。在英国，超过一百万的妇女被认为错过了治疗。在其他地方，HRT疗法的普及率甚至更低。在匈牙利和俄罗斯，只有3%的更年期妇女接受这种治疗。在没有处方激素治疗的情况下，一些妇女转向了天然药剂, 虽然这些天然药物可能能够减轻更年期症状, 但却不会降低她们未来心脏病发生的风险。一些类型的黑升麻，虽然它是一种流行的草药补充剂，但已经被认为与肝中毒有关。在中国、日本和新加坡等国家，人们使用中药。富含植物雌激素的饮食，如大豆，可以减轻更年期症状。这也许可以解释为什么东亚女性遭受的痛苦较少。但没有什么比HRT疗法更有效了。回避它，只意味着一些女性在伤害自己。

== 08. Millions of women are missing out on hormone replacement therapy 纯净版

This much-maligned treatment could save many lives

Dec 12th 2019 |


IT `系` WAS A combination of things. An unusual feeling of depression. Constant forgetfulness. An irregular menstrual cycle. `主` Lucy, a British woman in her early 40s, `谓` knew that something was wrong. Two years before she had been training at the gym five times a week. Now she could barely find the energy to exercise at all *thanks to* chronic insomnia, a new affliction. Her demeanour had shifted from one of cheeriness to constant anxiety. Her work and her home life were suffering as a result.

Unsure what was causing these changes, she visited her doctor. The physician blamed(v.) stress. She suggested Lucy return(v.) in a year. Frustrated, Lucy turned to the internet. Her research led her to believe that she was entering the transition into menopause. Menopause is the time in the middle of a woman’s life  -- which can begin in the early 40s -- when `主` her levels of hormones such as oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone `谓` *plummet*(v.). This eventually causes her ovaries to stop producing eggs /and her periods to cease. After a year without periods, a woman is considered to be menopausal. The symptoms of menopause can include hot flushes, depression, aches and pains, insomnia, anxiety and transient memory loss.

Lucy’s experience is unremarkable in two ways. First, every woman experiences menopause. Second, `主` doctors all over the world `谓` often fail to provide them with treatment that could alleviate their symptoms. Research suggests that 70-80% of women experience symptoms and for just over a quarter they are debilitating. [On average] they last(v.) for seven and a half years.

And yet doctors often encourage women to grin(v.) and bear it. Some suggest eating well and exercising more, which may ease(v.) the symptoms. Some prescribe(v.) antidepressants or anti-epileptics, which do not treat the cause of the problem. `主` A cheap, effective alternative `谓` exists(v.): hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). But as a result of misinformation and scaremongering, millions of women are missing out on it.

Menopause harms(v.) women’s bones, brains, hearts and immune systems. It is associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis and fragility fractures, 分词作状语 increased(v.) abdominal fat, and a heightened risk of *contracting*(v.) diabetes, explains Susan Davis, a professor of women’s health at Monash University in Australia.

`主` The hormonal changes of menopause `谓` also seem to make women age(v.) faster. They speed up cellular ageing by about 6%, when age is measured by the genetic changes in the blood. It is suspected that `主` the insomnia associated with menopause `谓` could be causing this. Oestrogen is particularly important in maintaining(v.) the health of women’s hearts. [Before menopause] women have fewer heart attacks than men. [After menopause] the risk increases(v.) 状 as the elasticity of the coronary arteries decreases(v.) along with their oestrogen levels.

By pill or by patch

In 1966 Robert Wilson, a doctor, wrote a book called “Feminine Forever”. In it, he argued that `主` women’s loss of hormones after menopause `谓` give rise to a serious, painful and often crippling illness, known as oestrogen-deficiency disease. `主` A regular course of oestrogen supplements `系` was the solution, he suggested. They would preserve women’s youth, sex appeal and marriages.

The book was divisive. Some women embraced(v.) taking oestrogen as a way to defeat the ravages of time. Others resisted(v.) what they saw as an attempt to pathologise(v.) a natural stage in a woman’s life. Nonetheless, [by the turn of the millennium] hormone-replacement therapy was extremely popular. [In America before 2001] some 20% of post-menopausal women used it [at some point]. [By then] a synthetic form of progesterone was being administered alongside oestrogen; it had been shown to protect women from an increased risk of uterine cancer caused by giving oestrogen [on its own].

The benefits of HRT seemed clear. Most immediately, it offered relief from the miserable symptoms of menopause. [In the longer term] it reduced the risk of osteoporosis (which rises after menopause) and therefore the risk of bone fractures. Women liked that it seemed to stop their skin thinning (probably because it boosts the levels of collagen, a protein). It was thought to reduce the risk of cognitive decline. But most importantly, studies suggested that it prevented the onset of cardiovascular disease -- one of the biggest killers of women.

The great hormone scare

By 1997 a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that HRT extended life expectancy for postmenopausal women by as much as three years. It had become a standard treatment. But then a bombshell dropped.

In 2002 `主` the results of a large randomised trial conducted by America’s National Institutes of Health, known as the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), `谓` were rushed into publication. It concluded that `主` taking oestrogen with synthetic progesterone `谓` increased women’s risk of breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Women were told that the dangers of HRT mostly outweighed(v.) any benefits.

This finding overturned decades of medical practice. As a final kicker, it emerged that Mr Wilson had received money from Wyeth-Ayerst, a company that made oestrogen, while writing his prohormone book. HRT went from wonderdrug to killer pill peddled by profit-hungry pharmaceutical firms. [Within six years] fewer than 5% of American post-menopausal women were taking it. [In Western countries] use of HRT increased(v.) rapidly during the 1990s but halved(v.) in the early 2000s. [To this day] doctors are reluctant to prescribe(v.) hormones to their patients.

But `主` the first conclusions of the WHI study, on which so much antipathy to HRT is still based(v.), `系` were almost entirely wrong. The study had hoped to look at strategies for preventing(v.) heart disease, cancer and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Avrum Bluming, an oncologist and co-author of a recent book, “Oestrogen Matters”, says that {[instead of recruiting(v.) healthy women in their late 40s and early 50s, who were entering menopause], the median age was 63}. These older recruits were already unhealthy. Half were obese. Nearly 50% were current or past smokers and more than a third had been treated for high blood pressure. `主` The women included in the study `谓` probably suffered from atherosclerosis -- where plaque builds up inside arteries /and makes heart disease more likely -- when it began, says Mr Bluming. `主` What the analysis in 2002 actually showed `系` was that {`主` offering(v.) older and more unhealthy women HRT `系` was a bad idea}. It said nothing about the women at whom the treatment was aimed(v.).

There were other problems. The WHI study almost completely excluded(v.) from the trial women who were experiencing(v.) menopausal symptoms, fearing that those given the placebo would abandon the trial when their symptoms were not relieved. But these are the women who would be expected to benefit most from the preventive effects of HRT. Recent research suggests that hot flushes and night sweats are associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

It is now clear that `主` the long-term benefits of HRT for women given it as they enter menopause `系` are significant. A careful reanalysis of the studies showed that women in their 50s were actually 31% less likely to die in the five to seven years that they were taking hormones. For women who have had their uterus removed /or who start(v.) menopause before the age of 45, it is life-saving, preventing osteoporosis and heart disease for as long as 18 years. There is a tiny increase in the rates of breast cancer among HRT-users after five years of the treatment. This was lower than the risk from working as a flight attendant.

`主` A study published in the Lancet, a British medical journal, earlier this year `谓` has reignited controversy over the level of risk of breast cancer that comes with hormone therapy. But Ms Davis and others worry that its conclusions are not reliable. [Moreover] any increase in risk must be weighed against that of developing other diseases.


`主` Taking HRT `谓` reduces the mortality of women aged 50-59 by at least 20% and as much as 40%, mostly because they suffer fewer heart attacks. One in 25 of all women will die of breast cancer; one in three will die of coronary heart disease; and one in six will die of a stroke. `主` Around 90% of women with breast cancer `谓` survive(v.) it in rich countries. [If women are on HRT at the time of their breast-cancer diagnosis] they are less likely to die from the disease. `主` Weighing such risks `系` is part of the decision about whether to embark on a course of HRT.

In addition to the flaws in the structure of the WHI study, `主` a change in the versions of hormones used in HRT `谓` explains the shifting scientific consensus on the treatment’s effects. `主` The synthetic form of progesterone used in the WHI `谓` probably triggered cardiovascular problems. `主` The progesterone that many women now take with an oestrogen supplement `谓` is thought less likely to do so.

`主` No long-term clinical trials of this specific combination of hormones `谓` have been carried out. But, in theory, it should bring all the benefits of oestrogen found in the WHI trial, with none of the risks of taking synthetic progesterone.

In the absence of such studies, HRT remains in medical limbo. And so women in their late 40s and early 50s are losing out. `主` The window of opportunity to begin HRT in order to capture its full benefits -- including resisting the effects of cognitive decline -- `系` may be as little as two or three years.

Lucy’s symptoms worsened(v.) after her doctor brushed her off. Convinced by her online research that she was transitioning into menopause, she paid to have blood tested. The results confirmed her suspicions that her hormone levels were the problem. She was prescribed personalised amounts of three hormones: an oestrogen patch, micronised progesterone and testosterone. Within three days her hot flushes had stopped, she was sleeping peacefully and her mood had returned to a happy equilibrium. She felt “superhuman”.

But her happy ending is less common than it should be. In Britain more than 1m women are thought to be missing out on treatment. Elsewhere, the prevalence of HRT is even lower. In Hungary and Russia just 3% of menopausal women receive it. In the absence of prescribed hormone therapy, some women turn to natural potions which may alleviate the symptoms of menopause but will not reduce a woman’s future risk of a heart attack. Some types of black cohosh, a popular herbal supplement, have been associated with liver poisoning. In countries such as China, Japan and Singapore, Chinese traditional medicines are used. `主` A diet rich in phytoestrogens, such as soya, `谓` may reduce the symptoms of menopause. This may explain why East Asian women suffer less. But nothing works as well as HRT. By shunning it, some women are harming(v.) themselves.
