== 2019-11-05. On impeachment, Congress struggles with an obstructive president

Unstoppable(`=that cannot be stopped or prevented`) force *meets* immovable(`=that cannot be moved`) object



Oct 10th 2019 | WASHINGTON, DC

`主` GORDON SONDLAND, America’s ambassador(`=an official who lives in a foreign country as the senior representative there of his or her own country`) to the European Union (EU) /and author of lawyerly 如律师的；适合于律师的 texts *denying* “*quid pro quo*’s(`= a thing given in return for sth else`) of any kind” between Mr Trump and Ukraine’s president, `谓` *was due(a.)(`=arranged or expected 预计`) to testify*(`=to make a statement that sth happened or that sth is true, especially as a witness in court （尤指出庭）作证`) before the three House committees(`=a group of people who are chosen, usually by a larger group, to make decisions or to deal with a particular subject`) on October 8th. ② That morning, in a tweet (that *showed* he *shared* his ambassador’s fondness 爱好；喜爱 for errant(a.)(`=doing sth that is wrong; not behaving in an acceptable way 行为不当的; 犯错误的`) apostrophes 省略符号;撇号), the president *blocked*(`=to prevent sth from happening, developing or making progress`) Mr Sondland *from appearing* before “a totally compromised 妥协;折衷 kangaroo court 私设的法庭;非法法庭, where Republican’s rights *have been taken away*.” ③ Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel(`=a lawyer or group of lawyers representing sb in court`), later *broadened*(`=to affect or make sth affect more people or things`) this recalcitrance(`=they are unwilling to obey orders or are difficult to deal with 顽抗,不服从`). ④ The executive branch *could not “be expected to participate in*” the House’s impeachment(`=the process of charging them with a crime that makes them unfit for office. 弹劾; 控告`) inquiry(`=the process of asking about or investigating something in order to find out more about it`), which he *called* a “highly partisan(a.)(`=showing too much support for one person, group or idea, especially without considering it carefully`) and unconstitutional(a.)(`=breaks the rules of a constitution`) effort”. Where does that *leave*(`=to make or allow sb/sth to remain in a particular condition, place, etc`) Congress?

====
- ambassador => 前缀ambi-, 两边，周围。 -ass, 词根ag的过去分词形式。原指古罗马帝国派到各地巡视的官员。
- *quid pro quo* : n. [ sing. ] ( from Latin ) a thing given in return for sth else 报偿；回报
- *kangaroo court* 不是“袋鼠法庭”，而是指“私设的法庭”或“非法法庭”。有时，当人们对一个合法法庭的判决有异议的时候，也会把它叫做 kangaroo court。
- impeach => im-,进入，使，pedica,脚链，词源同foot,expedite.原义为阻止，防止，后引申词义控告，弹劾。
====

As a matter of law, Mr Cipollone is wrong: the constitution *gives* the House of Representatives “the sole power of impeachment”. ② Mr Cipollone *complained* that {the president *cannot cross-examine*(`=to question sb carefully and in a lot of detail about answers that they have already given, especially in court （尤指在法庭上对证词细节的）盘问，反诘`) witnesses /or *see* the evidence against him. That *misunderstands* the process}. ③ In an impeachment proceeding(`=the process of using a court to settle a disagreement or to deal with a complaint`) the House *plays the role of* a grand jury 大陪审团, *evaluating*(`=to form an opinion of the amount, value or quality of sth after thinking about it carefully`) evidence and *weighing*(`=to consider sth carefully before making a decision 权衡；斟酌`) whether to indict(v.)(`=to officially charge sb with a crime`). ④ The president *mounts(`=to organize and begin sth`) a defence* in the Senate trial(`=a formal meeting in a law court, at which a judge and jury listen to evidence and decide whether a person is guilty of a crime`).

====
- mount : V-T If you mount a campaign or event, *you organize it and make it take place*. 组织; 发动 +
-> *to mount a protest*/campaign/an exhibition 发起抗议╱运动；举办展览
====

Mr Cipollone *has asserted*(`=to state clearly and firmly that sth is true`) that {`主` the lack of a full House vote (*to begin* an impeachment inquiry) `谓` *renders*(v.)(`=to cause sb/sth to be in a particular state or condition`) the current process *invalid*}. ② This has no basis(n.)(`= the important facts, ideas or events that support sth and that it can develop from 基础`) in law or House rules. ③ Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker(`= the title of the person whose job is to control the discussions in a parliament （议会的）议长`), *may be playing* politics *in trying to ensure that* {`主` Democrats from districts 地区；区域 (Mr Trump *won*) `谓` *do not have to cast*(`=to vote for sb/sth`) a tough vote}, but impeachment *is* a political process as well as a quasi-legal 准合法的 one. ④ There *are* no rules (that *say* Ms Pelosi *needs* backing from a floor vote 参议院全院投票 *to open* an inquiry). ⑤ `主` Where Mr Cipollone is right `系` *is* that 同位 support for the inquiry *is* partisan(a.)(`=showing too much support for one person, group or idea, especially without considering it carefully`). ⑥ But that is largely because {many Republicans *are now reduced to*(`=to force sb/sth into a particular state or condition, usually a worse one 使陷入（更坏的）境地；使沦落；使陷入窘境`) *excusing* 为…辩解（或找理由） conduct(n.)(`=a person's behaviour in a particular place or in a particular situation`) that before 2016 they *would probably have deemed*(`=to have a particular opinion about sth`) unacceptable}.

Cipollone先生正确的地方在于, 对调查的支持的确是有党派色彩的。但这在很大程度上是因为, 许多共和党人现在沦落到了为2016年前他们可能认为不可接受的行为开脱的地步。

====
- basis : N-COUNT The basis of something is *its starting point or an important part of it from which it can be further developed*. 基础 +
-> Both factions have broadly agreed that the U.N. plan is *a possible basis* for negotiation.
两派已大致同意该联合国计划是谈判的可能基础。

- floor vote 就是指就某项法案在参议院会场投票表决，也称为“全院表决”，或者“院会投票”，*floor在这指的是full assembly（整个参议院，全体议员）*。 +
Floor还可以用来指议会的议员席；会议上的发言权，比如：He asked the chairman for the floor. （他要求主席允许他发言。）类似的说法还有 floor debate（会场辩论）、take the floor（在会议上发言；参加讨论）。

- *REDUCE SB/STH (FROM STH) TO STH/TO DOING STH* :
[ usually passive ] to force sb/sth into a particular state or condition, usually a worse one 使陷入（更坏的）境地；使沦落；使陷入窘境 +
-> *They were reduced to* begging in the streets. 他们沦落到沿街乞讨。 +
-> *She was reduced to tears* by their criticisms. 他们的批评使她流下了眼泪。

In a civil(`=involving personal legal matters and not criminal law 民事的（非刑事的）`) or criminal trial （法院的）审讯，审理，审判, people who *flout*(`=to show that you have no respect for a law, etc. by openly not obeying it`) a court’s instructions(`=something that sb tells you to do`) *can be found* in contempt(`=the feeling that sb/sth is without value and deserves no respect at all`), and either *fined* 处…以罚金 or *imprisoned*(`= to put sb in a prison or another place from which they cannot escape`) until they *comply*. ② This *is not* an option for those *running the impeachment inquiry* in the House. ③ Congress *has not detained*(`=to keep sb in an official place, such as a police station, a prison or a hospital, and prevent them from leaving`) anyone since 1935, when a Hoover administration official *was held*(`=to keep sb and not allow them to leave`) at the Willard Hotel. ④ As fractious(a.)(`=bad-tempered or easily upset, especially by small things; /making trouble and complaining`) as American politics is today, `主` Ms Pelosi *dispatching*(`=to send sb/sth somewhere, especially for a special purpose`) the Capitol police 美国国会警察 *to seize*(`=to arrest or capture sb`) Mr Cipollone or Mr Sondland at the White House, *possibly precipitating*(`=to suddenly force sb/sth into a particular state or condition`) a physical confrontation between security forces, `谓` *would make things worse*.

====
- flout => 词源不详。可能来自flute, 笛子，长笛。原指吹笛的人，引申词义藐视，瞧不起。可能是来自人们心目中艺术家的清冷，高傲。
- contemn => con-, 强调。-tem，砍，切，词源同tome, anatomy. 即被切掉的无用部分，不屑一顾的。

- fractious : a. (1) *bad-tempered or easily upset, especially by small things* 暴躁的；易怒的；动辄烦躁的 +
(2) *making trouble and complaining* 捣乱的；表示不满的 +
=> 来自PIE bhreg, 分开，破开，*词源同break, fragment.* 即破开，引申词义暴躁，易怒。 +

-> Children often *get fractious and tearful* when tired. 孩子们疲倦时易烦躁好哭。

- precipitate : v. (1) *to make sth, especially sth bad, happen suddenly or sooner than it should* 使…突然降临；加速（坏事的发生） +

(2) *~ sb/sth into sth : to suddenly force sb/sth into a particular state or condition* 使突然陷入（某种状态） +
-> The assassination of the president *precipitated the country into war*. 总统被暗杀使国家骤然陷入战争状态。

====

在民事或刑事审判中，藐视法庭指令的人, 可能被判藐视法庭，罚款或监禁，直到他们遵守为止。这并非那些在众议院进行弹劾调查的人, 想要做出的选择。自1935年胡佛政府官员被关押在威拉德酒店以来，国会从未拘留过任何人。今天的美国政治是如此的难以驾驭，佩洛西派遣国会警察在白宫抓捕Cipollone先生或Sondland先生，可能会引发他们与政府保安人员之间的身体对抗，这只会使事情变得更糟。


Some Democrats *have considered*(`=to think about sth carefully, especially in order to make a decision`) reviving(v.)(`=to become, or to make sb/sth become, conscious or healthy and strong again; /to make sth start being used or done again`) Congress’s powers of “inherent contempt” which, at least in theory, *allow* them *to levy(`=to use official authority to demand and collect a payment, tax, etc`) fines* on recalcitrant(a.)(`=unwilling to obey rules or follow instructions; difficult to control`) witnesses 目击者;证人. ② Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee 美国众议院情报委员会 chair, *suggested* fines of $25,000 per day. ③ That *would solve two problems* for the House, and *appeals*(`=to attract or interest sb 吸引或引起某人的兴趣`) for two reasons. ④ First, it *would be* quick, whereas(`= used at the beginning of a sentence in an official document to mean ‘because of the fact that...’ （用于正式文件中句子的开头）鉴于`) `主` *obtaining* penalties(n.)(`=a punishment for breaking a law, rule or contract`) for civil contempt charges(`=an official claim made by the police that sb has committed a crime`) `谓` *can require* lengthy(a.)(`=very long, and often too long, in time or size`) court battles. ⑤ Second, criminal contempt citations 传票 *require* the Justice Department 司法部门 *to prosecute*(`=to officially charge sb with a crime in court`), which, under William Barr, the attorney(`=a person who is given the power to act on behalf of another in business or legal matters`)-general(`=a country's chief law officer and senior legal adviser to its government 首席检察官;总检察长`), it *is* vanishingly 难以察觉地；消遁似地；趋于零地 unlikely to do. But it *is* an untried strategy. ⑥ The House *would first have to establish rules*, and *provide* contemnors 藐视法庭者 *with* some form of due process  正当法律程序. ⑦ The House *majority would almost certainly face* a legal challenge [if it *invoked*(`=to make sb have a particular feeling or imagine a particular scene; /to mention or use a law, rule, etc. as a reason for doing sth`) inherent contempt, *limiting* its capacity *to change* anyone’s behaviour].

====
- recalcitrant : a. ( formal ) *unwilling to obey rules or follow instructions; difficult to control* 不守规章的；不服从指挥的；桀骜不驯的；难以控制的 +
=> re-,向后，往回，-calc,脚跟，踢，词源同 calcaneus,decal,inculcate.引申词义难以控制的。 +
-> The danger is that *recalcitrant(a.) local authorities* will reject their responsibilities.
危险在于那些不服从命令的地方当局将拒绝履行他们的职责。
- prosecute => pro-,向前，-sec,跟随，追随，词源同execute,sequence.引申诸相关词义。

- *due process* : N-UNCOUNT In law, *due process* refers to *the carrying out of the law according to established rules and principles*. 正当法律程序
====



Democrats thus *find* themselves with a familiar dilemma(`=a difficult situation in which you have to choose between two or more alternatives. 进退两难的局面`). How *should* they *exercise oversight*(n.)(`=responsible for making sure that a process or system works efficiently and correctly 监督`) when the White House *refuses to follow the rules*? One option *would be* `表` *to move swiftly to* an impeachment vote /and *make* the stonewalling(`= to delay a discussion or decision by refusing to answer questions or by talking a lot 防守挡击（政治上指通过沉默或冗长发言等手段阻碍议事或拖延决议）`) 宾补 part of an obstruction(`= the fact of trying to prevent sth/sb from making progress`) charge(`=an official claim made by the police that sb has committed a crime`). Yet Democrats *would rather* take more time in the hope of *swaying*(`=to persuade sb to believe sth or do sth`) public opinion, which *seems* to be moving their way (see Lexington). If they *impeach*(`= to charge an important public figure with a serious crime`) the president *on* what sounds like a technicality(n.)(`=a small detail in a law or set of rules, especially one that does not seem fair 诉讼程序性细节，技术性细则（尤指似乎不合理的）`), and before *conducting* a full inquiry, it *would be* easier for Senate Republicans 参议院的共和党人 *to defend* him.

因此，民主党人发现自己陷入了熟悉的两难境地。当白宫拒绝遵守规则时，他们应该如何进行监督？一种选择是迅速进行弹劾投票，并将共和党的"防守挡击"这种行为, 作为"阻碍了指控"罪行的一部分。然而，民主党人宁愿花更多的时间，希望能影响公众舆论，这似乎正在朝着他们的方向发展(见列克星敦)。如果他们弹劾总统听起来像是技术性的，在进行全面调查之前，参议院共和党人会更容易为他辩护。


That may *explain* the White House’s strategy. *Reasoning*(`=to form a judgement about a situation by considering the facts and using your power to think in a logical way`) that the House *will probably vote to impeach eventually*, why not *get it over*(`=overcome it 解决`) with now? As soon as the House *votes to impeach*, control of both the procedure(`=a way of doing sth, especially the usual or correct way （正常）程序，手续，步骤`) and the news cycle *will shift from* Ms Pelosi and House Democrats *to* Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans. By the time (voters *head(`=to move in a particular direction`) to* the polls(n.)(`= an election for a country's government, or the place where people go to vote in an election`) next year), impeachment *would be* old news. And it *will have been* more than a year [since the president’s lawyer *affirmed*(`=to state firmly or publicly that sth is true or that you support sth strongly`) in writing that {`主` *seeking* intervention(`=the act of intervening in a situation`) from a foreign government in an American election `系` “*was* completely appropriate(a.)(`=suitable, acceptable or correct for the particular circumstances`)”}].

====
- intervention =>  inter-中间,之间,相互 + -vent-来 + -ion名词词尾
====

这或许可以解释白宫的策略。考虑到众议院最终可能会投票弹劾，为什么不现在就了结这件事呢？一旦众议院投票弹劾，程序和新闻周期的控制权将从佩洛西女士和众议院民主党人转移到米奇·麦康奈尔(Mitch McConnell)和参议院共和党人。到明年选民前往投票站的时候，弹劾已经是老生常谈了。 此时离 总统的律师在书面上确认，寻求外国政府干预美国大选“是完全合适的”, 这件事, 已经超过一年多了。

Unstoppable force meets immovable object



Oct 10th 2019 | WASHINGTON, DC

`主` GORDON SONDLAND, America’s ambassador to the European Union (EU) and author of lawyerly texts *denying* “quid pro quo’s of any kind” between Mr Trump and Ukraine’s president, `谓` *was due to testify* before the three House committees on October 8th. That morning, in a tweet that *showed* he shared his ambassador’s fondness for errant apostrophes, the president *blocked* Mr Sondland *from appearing before* “a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican’s rights *have been taken away*.” Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, later *broadened* this recalcitrance. The executive branch *could not “be expected to participate in”* the House’s impeachment inquiry, which he *called* a “highly partisan and unconstitutional effort”.

There *are* no rules (that *say* Ms Pelosi *needs* backing from a floor vote *to open* an inquiry). Where Mr Cipollone is right `系` *is* that `表` support for the inquiry *is* partisan. But that *is* largely because many Republicans *are now reduced to excusing* conduct (that before 2016 they *would probably have deemed* unacceptable).

In a civil or criminal trial, people who *flout* a court’s instructions *can be found* in contempt, and either *fined* or *imprisoned* until they *comply*. This *is not* an option for those *running the impeachment inquiry* in the House.

== 2019-11-06. China’s “maritime road”

中国的“海上丝绸之路”

The best offence(`=the act of upsetting or insulting sb`) *is* a good defence

China’s foreign port-building *helps to protect* existing trade routes(`=（旧时的）商队路线，商船航线`)

防御是最好的进攻 +
中国的海外港口建设, 有助于保护现有贸易路线

AN OLD SAYING(`=a well-known phrase or statement that expresses sth about life that most people believe is wise and true`) *warns about* Greeks (*bearing* gifts), but it might *fit* the Chinese better. ② In the 1400s Zheng He, a Muslim slave who *became* the Ming empire’s admiral(`=an officer of very high rank in the navy`), *led* seven voyages(n.)(`=a long journey, especially by sea or in space`) [south and west]. He *offered* treasure(`=a collection of valuable things such as gold, silver and jewellery`) *to* every leader he *met* -- but only if they *acknowledged* the emperor, *joining* a world order *centred on* Beijing.

====
- *centre around/on/round/upon sb/sth +
centre sth around/on/round/upon sb/sth* +
to be or make sb/sth become the person or thing around which most activity, etc. takes place 把…当作中心；（使）成为中心 +
-> Discussions *were centred on* developments in Eastern Europe. 讨论围绕着东欧的发展这一中心议题进行
====

西方有句老话，警告人们小心带着礼物来的希腊人，但这句话用在中国人身上也许更合适。明朝有个叫郑和的穆斯林，早年曾做奴隶，后来任水师将领，在15世纪七次下西洋。他向沿途所经各地的首领送上财宝，但前提是他们承认明朝皇帝, 并加入以北京为中心的世界秩序。

Chinese leaders today *are following in* Zheng’s wake(n.)(`=the track that a boat or ship leaves behind on the surface of the water `). ② `主` The “road” half(n.) of its _Belt and Road Initiative_(`=a new plan for dealing with a particular problem /or for achieving a particular purpose`)) (BRI) 一带一路倡议 -- a global infrastructure-building scheme(`= a plan or system for doing or organizing sth`) -- `系` *is* a maritime(a.)(`=connected with the sea or ships`) one of seaports(`=a town with a harbour used by large ships`) and shipping channels(`=a route used by boats`) 船运通道. ③ Xi Jinping, China’s president, *has said* it *will create* a new model of “win-win co-operation”. ④ Some critics *suspect*(`=to be suspicious about sth; to not trust sth`) nefarious(a.)(`=criminal; immoral`) motives, such as *yoking* 用轭把（动物）套在一起；给（动物）上轭 poor countries *to* China by giving them unrepayable 无法支付的 loans.

====
- nefarious => 来自拉丁语nefas,罪行，邪恶，不虔诚，ne-,无，没有，fas,公理，正义，神权，词源同fate.引申词义罪恶的，邪恶的。

- yoke : v. ( formal ) *to bring two people, countries, ideas, etc. together so that they are forced into a close relationship* （强行）使结合，使联合 +
-> The Hong Kong dollar *was yoked to the American dollar* for many years. 港元多年来与美元挂钩。
====

今天的中国领导人正在仿效郑和的做法。全球基础设施建设计划“一带一路”倡议中的“路”, 指的是海路，以建设港口和航运通道为目标。中国国家主席习近平表示, 这将开创一种“合作共赢”的新模式。一些批评人士疑心这背后动机不纯，例如中国可能向穷国提供它们无力偿还的贷款，从而控制它们。

The BRI *has evolved(`=to develop gradually, especially from a simple to a more complicated form; to develop sth in this way`) site by site* and Chinese officials *have not made* their intentions(n.)(`=what you intend or plan to do; your aim`) clear. ② However, `主` the locations of the 22 maritime-road projects that we *have identified as* under way(`=it has already started`)  `谓` *show* how it is most likely *to aid* China. ③ They *suggest* it *will be* more useful for *protecting* existing trade routes than *expanding* Chinese influence.

====
- underway : ADJ If an activity is underway, *it has already started*. If an activity gets underway, *it starts*. 进行中的 +
-> *An investigation is underway*(a.) to find out how the disaster happened. 一项调查正在进行，以查明这场灾难是如何发生的。
====

“一带一路”项目已在逐步推进，而中国官员尚未清楚表明他们的意图。但我们找到了海上丝绸之路22个在建项目的位置，显示出中国最有可能从“一带一路”获得的帮助。从这些地点来看，它更大的作用是保护现有贸易路线，而不是扩大中国的影响力。

*To measure* the maritime road’s impact(`=the powerful effect that sth has on sb/sth`), we *tested* three benefits it *could offer* China. ② If the road *were* a resource grab(`=a sudden attempt to take or hold sb/sth`), its projects *should cluster*(v.)(`=to come together in a small group or groups`) in places that *sell* raw materials that China *imports*. ③ If its aim *were* to boost(v.) trade, it *should track* the busiest routes *used by* Chinese shipping(n.)(`=the activity of carrying people or goods from one place to another by ship`) today, or where trade *is* likely to grow fastest. ④ And if it *were intended to secure*(`=to protect sth so that it is safe and difficult to attack or damage`) current trade routes, its ports *should sit near* choke(`=
a device that controls the amount of air flowing into the engine of a vehicle （车辆发动机的）阻风门，阻塞门`) points 瓶颈;阻塞点 -- areas whose closure *would force* goods *to travel circuitously* 迂回地;绕圈子地 -- or in places that *offer* alternative routes.

为衡量海上丝绸之路的影响，我们检验了它可能带给中国的三个好处: +
-> 如果这条“路”是为了抢夺资源，那么项目应集中在中国进口原材料的供应地。 +
-> 如果是为了促进贸易，那么项目应紧盯中国如今最繁忙的货运航线，或是对华贸易可能增长最快的地区。 +
-> 如果是为了保护现有贸易路线，那么项目建设的港口应靠近咽喉要道（一旦封锁将迫使货物绕行）, 或备选航道上的要地。

We *tested* these explanations *by using* them *to predict* if countries *host* a BRI port. ② The results *were* conclusive(a.)(`=proving sth, and allowing no doubt or confusion`). ③ After *holding* other factors constant(a.)(`=that does not change; fixed`), there *was* no statistically significant link *between* having a BRI port *and* (1)exporting raw materials that China wants, or (2)*having* high current or projected(`=to plan an activity, a project etc. for a time in the future`) trade with it. ④ In contrast, `主` the “trade-protection benefit” -- [*either*] (1)the value of Chinese trade (in a country’s waters) *multiplied 乘；乘以 by* the extra distance (goods *would have to go* if those routes *were shut*), [*or*] (2)the amount of trade (that *would be diverted(`=to make sb/sth change direction`) to* a country if shipping *were disrupted*(`=to make it difficult for sth to continue in the normal way`) elsewhere(`=in other places or to another place`)) -- `系` *was* a good predictor(`=something that can show what will happen in the future`). ⑤ *Given* 假设事实;考虑到 two otherwise(ad.)(`=apart from that`) average countries, `主` one (*with* a high trade-protection benefit (like Libya 埃及以西的北非地方古名；利比亚)) `系` *is* 2.7 times *likelier 更可能的 to host* a BRI port *than* another (with an average benefit (like Liberia 西非国家利比里亚)).

====
- otherwise : ad. *apart from that* 除此以外 +
->He was slightly bruised *but otherwise unhurt*. 他除了一点青肿之外没有受伤。

为检验这些解释是否合理，我们利用它们来预测各个国家能否吸引到“一带一路”的港口项目。结论是明确的。在其他因素不变的情况下，建设“一带一路”港口, 与出口中国所需的原材料, 在统计上没有显著关联，与当前已存在或未来可能发生的大笔对华贸易的关联也不显著。相比之下，*“有利于保护贸易”是个有效的预测根据*，其计算方式或者是 : 用一国海域内的对华贸易额, 乘以货物在现有路线封锁的情况下须绕行的额外里程数，或是 : 因货运在其他地区受阻, 而转移到一个国家的贸易量。在其他条件相当的两个国家之间，更“有利于保护贸易”的国家（如利比亚）, 吸引“一带一路”港口项目的可能性, 是此方面优势不明显的国家（如利比里亚）的2.7倍。

*Owning or running* a port *does not guarantee*(`=to promise to do sth; to promise sth will happen`) perpetual(a.)(`=continuing for a long period of time without interruption`) access, but it *does give* China influence *by enabling it to disrupt*(`=to make it difficult for sth to continue in the normal way`) the host’s own shipping if it chooses. ② Many overland(`=across the land; by land, not by sea or by air`) “belt” routes in the BRI *would also make* Chinese trade 宾补 more resilient(`=able to feel better quickly after sth unpleasant such as shock, injury, etc`). ③ For example, if the Strait(`=a narrow passage of water that connects two seas or large areas of water`) of Malacca 马六甲海峡 *were closed*, China *could switch to* BRI ports it *wants to build* in Myanmar 缅甸, and *finish* the trip *on planned* BRI rail lines.

在国外拥有或经营港口, 并不能保证中国可以永久使用该港口，但在需要时，中国可以通过干扰东道国自身的货运来发挥影响。“一带一路”的许多陆上经济“带”, 也将增强中国贸易的弹性。例如，如果马六甲海峡被封锁，中国可改用计划在缅甸建造的“一带一路”港口，然后通过规划中的“一带一路”铁路完成运输。

China’s military footprint *also shows* a focus on *guarding* trade routes. Its only base(`=a place where an army, a navy, etc. operates from 基地`) (abroad) *is* at _Djibouti’s Bab al-Mandab Strait_ -- the waterway whose closure *would hurt* China *more than* anywhere else.

中国的军事布局, 也显示了政府对保护贸易路线的重视。中国唯一的海外军事基地, 位于吉布提的曼德海峡（Bab al-Mandab Strait）—— 这条航道一旦关闭, 带给中国的伤害将比其他任何地方都要大。

== 2019-11-06. China’s “maritime road” 纯净版


The best offence *is* a good defence

China’s foreign port-building *helps to protect* existing trade routes

AN OLD SAYING *warns about* Greeks *bearing* gifts, but it *might fit* the Chinese better. In the 1400s Zheng He, a Muslim slave who *became* the Ming empire’s admiral, *led* seven voyages [south and west]. He *offered treasure to* every leader he met -- but only if they *acknowledged* the emperor, *joining* a world order *centred on* Beijing.

Chinese leaders today *are following in* Zheng’s wake. `主` *The “road” half* of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -- a global infrastructure-building scheme -- `系` *is* a maritime one of seaports and shipping channels. Xi Jinping, China’s president, *has said* it *will create* a new model of “win-win co-operation”. Some critics *suspect* nefarious motives, such as *yoking* poor countries *to* China *by giving* them unrepayable loans.

The BRI *has evolved site by site* and Chinese officials *have not made* their intentions *clear*. However, `主` the locations of the 22 maritime-road projects (that we *have identified as* under way) `谓` *show* how it is most likely to aid China. They *suggest* {it *will be* more useful for *protecting* existing trade routes than *expanding* Chinese influence}.

*To measure* the maritime road’s impact, we *tested* three benefits it *could offer* China. If the road *were* a resource grab, its projects *should cluster in* places that *sell* raw materials that China *imports*. If its aim *were* to boost(v.) trade, it *should track* the busiest routes *used by* Chinese shipping today, or where trade *is likely to grow fastest*. And if it *were intended to secure* current trade routes, its ports *should sit near* choke points—areas whose closure *would force goods to travel circuitously* -- or in places that *offer* alternative routes.

We *tested* these explanations *by using them to predict* {if countries *host* a BRI port}. The results *were* conclusive. After *holding* other factors (constant), there *was* no statistically significant link *between* having a BRI port *and* ① exporting(v.) raw materials that China wants, or ② having high current or projected trade with it. In contrast, `主` the “trade-protection benefit” -- *either* the value of Chinese trade (in a country’s waters) *multiplied by* the extra distance (goods *would have to go* if those routes *were shut*), *or* the amount of trade (that *would be diverted to* a country if shipping *were disrupted* elsewhere) -- `系` *was* a good predictor. *Given* two otherwise average countries, `主` one with a high trade-protection benefit (like Libya) `系` *is 2.7 times likelier to host a BRI port* than another with an average benefit (like Liberia).


`主` *Owning or running* a port `谓` *does not guarantee* perpetual access, but it *does give* China influence *by enabling it to disrupt* the host’s own shipping if it chooses. Many overland “belt” routes in the BRI *would also make* Chinese trade *more resilient*(a.). For example, if the Strait of Malacca *were closed*, China *could switch to* BRI ports it *wants to build* in Myanmar, and *finish* the trip *on planned* BRI rail lines.

China’s military footprint *also shows* a focus on *guarding* trade routes. Its only base abroad *is* at Djibouti’s Bab al-Mandab Strait -- the waterway whose closure *would hurt* China *more than* anywhere else.

TWO YEARS ago British chocoholics(n.)(`=a person who likes chocolate very much and eats a lot of it`) *felt* the pinch(`=to hold sth tightly between the thumb and finger or between two things that are pressed together`) from the decision (*to leave* the European Union). ② As sterling 英镑 *tumbled*(`=to fall rapidly in value or amount`), `主` global firms *selling to* the British market `谓` *faced* the same production costs [as before], but *got less money* for each sweet *sold*. ③ Rather than *raise the price* per chocolate, some *chose to shrink(`=to become or to make sth smaller in size or amount`) the chocolate* per price. ④ The famous peaks on a bar of Toblerone 瑞士三角牌巧克力 *grew conspicuously(`=easy to see or notice; likely to attract attention`) less numerous*(a.)(`=existing in large numbers`) (though Mondelez, the bar’s maker, *said* Brexit was not the cause). ⑤ Other products *suffered* the same “shrinkflation 价格虽然不变,但东西的含量却少了”: toilet rolls 厕用卷纸 and toothpaste tubes 牙膏管 became smaller. ⑥ The threat of Brexit *made the phenomenon more visible*, but it is surprisingly common. Statisticians(`=a person who studies statistics or who works using statistics`) and policymakers *need to take note*(`=to pay attention to sth and be sure to remember it`).

====
- shrinkflation : 指某些受欢迎的小食品在维持原价的同时，却将大小或数量减少了。简而言之，就是你花了同样的钱，购买的东西却少了。 +
Shrinkflation是一个合成词，由shrink（“缩小尺寸”）与inflation的经济学释义（“价格普遍上升与货币的购买力下降”）构成。 +
几个–flation构成的合成词现已经进入了英语语言，例如 : +
-> stagflation：“某个国家经济状况出现持久的高通货膨胀，伴有高失业率与需求停滞”。Stagflation最早出现在20世纪60年代。 +
-> agflation：“农产品需求上涨所带来的食品价格上涨”。Agflation是一个相对较新的新造词，出现在21世纪早期。 +
-> Shrinkflation的用法有点特别，用来指产品的量减少了，而不是价格上涨了 -- 毕竟，生产商要在不明显提高产品价格的情况下，暗中维持其利润空间。

两年前英国脱欧的决定, 让巧克力控们感受到了冲击。随着英镑暴跌，向英国市场销售甜食的跨国公司面临的生产成本, 还和从前一样，单位产品的实际收入却减少了。一些公司没有选择提高巧克力的单价，而是让每单位价格的巧克力“瘦身”。每条三角巧克力棒（Toblerone）上著名的“山峰”的数量明显少了，尽管制造商亿滋（Mondelez）否认这是脱欧引发的。其他产品也出现了同样的“瘦身式涨价”，比如卷筒纸和牙膏管都变小了。虽然这种现象因为英国脱欧的威胁变得更加明显，但它实则惊人地普遍。统计学家和政策制定者都需要引起注意。

Every first-year economics student *quickly becomes familiar with* charts 图表 of supply and demand, which *place* price *on* one axis /and quantity *on* the other. ② *Given* a drop in demand, the charts *show*, firms *can either* sell(v.) fewer items [at the prevailing(`=existing or most common at a particular time`) price] *or* cut prices to prop up(`=to support it or help it to survive`) sales. ③ But online retailing, which *makes it easier to collect* fine-grained(`=having a fine smooth even grain 细粒度的`) price data, *reveals* how poorly(`=in a way that is not good enough`) textbook models *reflect* real-world market dynamics. ④ The prices of consumer goods, it *turns out, behave oddly*.

每个经济学专业的新生, 很快都会熟悉供求关系图，图上两条轴线分别用来标示价格和数量。图表显示，如果需求下降，企业要么维持现价、少卖商品，要么降价以提振销量。但是，更容易收集到详细价格数据的在线零售业却揭示，教科书上的模型远不能正确反映现实的市场动态。事实证明，消费品价格的变动很是古怪。

A forthcoming paper by Diego Aparicio and Roberto Rigobon of _the Massachusetts Institute of Technology_ 麻省理工学院 *helps* make the point. ② Firms that *sell* thousands of different items *do not offer them* at thousands of different prices, but rather *slot(`=to put sth into a space that is available or designed for it; to fit into such a space`) them into* a dozen or two price points. ③ *Visit* the website for H&M, a fashion retailer, and you *will find* a staggering(a.)(`=so great, shocking or surprising that it is difficult to believe`) array of items for £9.99: hats, scarves 围巾, jewellery, belts 腰带;皮带, bags, herringbone(`=a pattern used, for example, in cloth consisting of lines of V-shapes that are parallel to each other （织物等的）人字形平行花纹`) braces 吊裤带；背带, satin(n.)(`=a smooth, shiny kind of cloth, usually made from silk 缎子) neckties 领带, patterned(a.)(`=decorated with a pattern`)) shirts 衬衫 for dogs and much more. ④ Another vast collection of items *cost* £6.99, and another, £12.99. ⑤ When sellers *change* an item’s price, they *tend not to nudge(`=to push sb gently, especially with your elbow, in order to get their attention`) it a little*, but rather *to re-slot it into* one of the pre-existing price categories(`=a group of people or things with particular features in common 类别，种类`). ⑥ The authors *dub*(`=to give sb/sth a particular name, often in a humorous or critical way`) this phenomenon “quantum pricing(`=the act of deciding how much to charge for sth`)” (quantum mechanics 量子力学 *grew* from the observation that the properties(`=a quality or characteristic that sth has`) of subatomic(a.)(`= smaller than, or found in, an atom`) particles *do not vary* along a continuum(a.)(`=a series of similar items in which each is almost the same as the ones next to it but the last is very different from the first （相邻两者相似但起首与末尾截然不同的）连续体`), *but* rather *fall into* discrete(a.)(`= independent of other things of the same type 分离的；互不相连的`) states).

====
- slot : v. *to put sth into a space that is available or designed for it; to fit into such a space* 投放；插入；（被）塞进；（被）装入 +
-> He *slotted* a cassette *into* the VCR. 他把录像带插入录像机中。 +
-> The bed comes in sections *which can be quickly slotted together*. 这种床以散件出售，很快就可以组装起来。

- nudge => 词源不详。 nudie 裸体照片，裸体表演 来自nudist的口语。
- dub => 起绰号，来自古法语adober, 原义为封爵士。 2.配音，缩写自double. 即再次录制声音。

- *quantum mechanics* : N the branch of mechanics, *based on the quantum theory* used for interpreting the behaviour of elementary particles and atoms, which do not obey Newtonian mechanics 量子力学

- continuum : n. *a series of similar items /in which each is almost the same as the ones next to it /but the last is very different from the first* （相邻两者相似但起首与末尾截然不同的）连续体 +
-> It is impossible to say *at what point along the continuum* a dialect becomes a separate language. 要说出同一语言的方言差异到什么程度就成为一种别的语言, 是不可能的。

- discrete => dis-, 分开，散开。-cret,区分，词源同crisis, critic, discern. 词义与discreet在17世纪前没有区别，后来才赋予不同的词义。

麻省理工学院的迭戈·阿帕里西奥（Diego Aparicio）和罗伯托·里哥本（Roberto Rigobon）, 即将发表的一篇论文, 有助于说明这一点。企业销售的商品成千上万，但不会一种商品一个价，而是会为它们设定十几二十个价格点。访问时装零售商H&M的网站，你会发现数量惊人的售价9.99英镑的商品，如帽子、围巾、首饰、腰带、包、交叉背带、缎子领带、给狗狗穿的花衬衫等等。还有大批售价为6.99英镑或12.99英镑的商品。当商家给商品调价时，往往不是微调，而是将它们归到其他业已存在的价格点之下。两位作者将这一现象称为“量子式定价”（量子力学所基于的观察是, 亚原子粒子是以离散而非连续体的形式变化）。

Just *as surprising as* 和...一样 the quantum way (in which prices adjust *is* how rarely they move at all). ② Retailers, Messrs Aparicio and Rigobon *suggest*, *seem to design* products *to fit* their preferred(`=you like that person or thing better than another, and so you are more likely to choose them if there is a choice`) price points. ③ *Given* a big enough shift in market conditions, such as an increase in labour costs, firms *often redesign* a product *to fit* the price *rather than* tweak(v.)(`=to pull or twist sth suddenly; /to make slight changes to a machine, system, etc. to improve it`) the price. ④ They *may make* a production process *less labour-intensive*(a.)(`=needing a lot of people to do it 劳动密集型的`) -- or *shave*(`=to cut very thin pieces from the surface of wood, etc`) a bit *off* a chocolate bar.

与量子式定价一样令人惊讶的是，价格根本就很少变动。阿帕里西奥和里哥本认为，零售商似乎是根据自己喜欢的价格点,来设计产品的。如果出现劳动力成本增加等较大的市场变化，企业常常会根据价格来重新设计产品，而不是微调价格。他们可能会减少生产过程中的用工量，或者把巧克力棒稍微刮掉一些。

Central banks *are starting to see* the consequences. ② Inflation *does not respond to* economic conditions *as much as* it used to. (To take one example, deflation 通货紧缩 during the Great Recession(`=a difficult time for the economy of a country, when there is less trade and industrial activity than usual and more people are unemployed`) *was* surprisingly mild and short-lived(a.)(`=lasting only for a short time`), and after nearly three years of unemployment below 5%, American inflation still trundles(`=to move or roll somewhere slowly and noisily; to move sth slowly and noisily, especially sth heavy, with wheels`) along *below* the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%.) ③ [In its recently published annual report] the Bank for International Settlements(`=the action of paying back money that you owe （欠款的）支付，偿付，结算`), a club of central banks, *mused*(`=to think carefully about sth for a time, ignoring what is happening around you 沉思;冥想;揣摩`) that quantum pricing and related phenomena *help account for* such trends.

====
- trundle : v. *to move or roll somewhere slowly and noisily; to move sth slowly and noisily, especially sth heavy, with wheels* （使缓慢、轰鸣地）移动，滚动 +
=> 来自中古英语 trendle,轮子，圈，来自中英语 trendel,小环，词源同 trend,河流转弯处，趋势。 -le,表反复。引申词义缓慢而沉重的走。 +
-> A train *trundled across the bridge*. 一列火车隆隆驶过大桥
====

各国央行已开始看到这样做的后果。经济状况对通货膨胀的影响不如过去那么大了。比如，大衰退时期的通货紧缩出奇地温和且短暂，而如今经历了近三年的失业率低于5%之后 ，美国的通胀率仍低于美联储2%的目标。“央行俱乐部”国际清算银行在最近发布的年度报告中推测，量子式定价和相关现象部分造成了这种趋势。

But firms’ aversion(n.)(`=you dislike them very much`) to increasing prices *may be* `表` *as much* a consequence of limp(`=lacking strength or energy`) inflation *as* a contributor(`=something that helps to cause sth`) to it. ② When the price of everything *rises a lot* year after year, as in the 1970s and 1980s, firms *can easily adjust* the real, inflation-adjusted cost of their wares *without putting off*(`=it makes you dislike it, or decide not to do or have it. 使反感; 使对…失去兴趣`) shoppers(n.)(`=a person who buys goods from shops/stores`). ③ `主` A 5.5% jump in the cost of a pint 品脱;液量单位 after years of 5% increases `谓` *does not send* beer drinkers *searching for* other pubs [in the way that a 0.5% hike(n.)(`= a large or sudden increase in prices, costs, etc`) after years of no change *might*]. ④ Thus falling inflation *can make prices “stickier”*. To compensate, firms *instead* find other ways *to impose costs on* buyers -- such as *making products smaller* or lower-quality.

====
- aversion : N-VAR If you have an aversion to someone or something, *you dislike them very much*. 厌恶 +
=> a-离开 + -vers-转 + -ion名词词尾
====
(但是，企业对价格上涨的厌恶可能既是造成通胀的因素之一，也是疲软通胀的后果。)  +
但是，企业不愿意涨价, 既可能是通胀疲软的一个原因，也可能是其结果。就像上世纪七八十年代所有商品年年大涨价之时，商家可以轻易调整商品经通胀调整后的实际成本，而不致引起消费者的反感。一品脱啤酒在连续多年涨价5%后, 再涨5.5%，并不会让客人跑到其他酒吧去，而如果价格多年不变后上涨0.5%, 却会有这种后果。因此，不断下降的通胀会使价格更具“粘性”。为弥补不涨价带来的损失，公司会寻找其他办法将成本转嫁到消费者头上，比如让产品瘦身或降低产品质量。

Labour markets *are affected, too*. Wages *are* notoriously(`=well known for being bad`) sticky, especially downwards(`=moving or pointing towards a lower level`). ② In a world of low inflation, the ability *to trim(`=to cut away unnecessary parts from sth`) pay* by *raising wages* less than inflation *is* lost(a.)(`=that cannot be obtained; that cannot be found or created again`) to firms, with serious macroeconomic 宏观经济的 consequences. ③ Economists *blame* sticky wages *for* causing unemployment during recessions 经济衰退. ④ *Facing* reduced demand, `主` firms (that *cannot cut pay* to maintain margins 边际利润率;毛利 while slashing(`= to reduce sth by a large amount`) prices) `谓` *instead(ad.) reduce* output(`=the amount of sth that a person, a machine or an organization produces`) -- and *sack*(`=to dismiss sb from a job 解雇`) workers.

====
- slash : v. *to reduce sth by a large amount* 大幅度削减；大大降低 +
=> 来自辅音丛 sl-,砍，劈，分开，比较 slab,slip,slat,slit,slot.引申比喻义削减。 +
-> to slash costs/prices/fares, etc. 大幅度降低成本、价格、车费等
- sack => 来自拉丁语 saccus,袋子，来自希腊语 sakkos,袋子，来自某闪族语词，比较希伯来语 saq,袋 子。通常指比较大的袋子，引申词义麻袋，购物袋等，后引申比喻义抢劫及现代词义解雇， 开除，卷包袱走人。
====
劳动力市场同样受到影响。工资的粘性之大众所周知，尤其是在向下调整时。在低通胀的情况下，公司没法用让工资涨幅低于通胀的方式来削减薪资，这给宏观经济带来了严重后果。经济学家将经济衰退期的失业归咎于粘性工资。面对需求减少，那些无法在大幅降价时削减薪资以维持利润的公司,只能转而减产和裁员。

But nimble(`=able to move quickly and easily; /able to think and understand quickly`) firms *have* other options: the employment version of *shaving* a bit of chocolate *from* the bar. ② Some *cut costs* by *boosting(`=to make sth increase, or become better or more successful`) output* per worker, often *by driving workers harder*. ③ Tellingly(ad.)(`=having a strong or important effect; effective `), `主` growth in output per worker now `谓` *tends to fall* [in booms] /and *rise* [during busts(`=to break sth; /it loses so much money that it is forced to close down`)], precisely(`=exactly`) the opposite(`=on the other side of a space from it`) of the pattern 40 years ago, when inflation *was* high. ④ Firms *can respond to* market pressures *by reducing the benefits* available to workers; Asda, a supermarket, *recently announced* plans *to slash*(`=to reduce sth by a large amount`) British workers’ holiday allowances(`=money that is given to someone, usually on a regular basis, in order to help them pay for the things that they need. 补贴`). ⑤ Or they *can offer* workers 双宾 more tortuous(a.)(`=not simple and direct; long, complicated and difficult to understand`) schedules(`=a plan that lists all the work that you have to do and when you must do each thing`). ⑥ Research *published* in 2017 *suggests* that {`主` being able *to vary* workers’ hours from week to week `系` *is* worth(a.) at least 20% of their wages}. On the flipside 另一面；反面, [during good times] firms *often opt(v.)选择；挑选 to reward* workers *with* office perks(`= special benefits; something you receive as well as your wages for doing a particular job`) and one-off(`=made or happening only once and not regularly`) bonuses, rather than *pay rises*(n.)(`=an increase in the money you are paid for the work you do 加薪`) that *cannot easily be clawed back* during downturns(`=a fall in the amount of business that is done; a time when the economy becomes weaker`).

但灵活的公司还有其他选择，比如把刮掉一点巧克力这个办法挪到用工环节上。一些公司通过提高人均产量, 来削减成本 -- 通常是加大员工的劳动强度。很能说明问题的是，现在的人均产量增长往往在经济繁荣时下降，在衰退时上升，与40年前通胀高企时的规律正好相反。公司可以通过减少工人的福利来应对市场压力。阿斯达超市（Asda）最近就宣布了削减英国工人假期津贴的计划。或者公司也可以给员工安排更含混不清的工作时间。2017年发表的一项研究表明，如果可以每周调整员工的工作时间，便相当于至少节省了20%的工资支出。另一方面，在经济繁荣期，公司往往选择用办公室福利和一次性奖金来奖励员工，而不是给他们加薪，因为加好的薪水没法在衰退期轻易再降下来。

The uncertainty principle

不确定性原则

If it *happens* [on a sufficiently(`=enough for a particular purpose; as much as you need`) large scale], `主` the practice of *tweaking quality* [in lieu of(`=instead of`) price] `谓` *could play havoc(`=a situation in which there is a lot of damage, destruction or confusion`) with* essential economic data. ② Statistical agencies *do their best to account for*(`=you can explain it or give the necessary information about it`) changing product quality, but [if adjustments *are* unexpectedly 出乎意料地，意外地 common /or subtle(`=not very noticeable or obvious`)] then muted(a.)(`=quiet; not as loud as usual; /soft and gentle, not bright and strong`) inflation figures *could easily be concealing* a more turbulent economic picture. ③ `主` Central banks (*watching for*(`=you pay attention so that you notice it, either because you do not want to miss it or because you want to avoid it 密切注视; 提防`) big swings(n.) in inflation or wage growth *as* a sign of trouble) `谓` *could be reacting to*(`=to change or behave in a particular way as a result of or in response to sth 起反应；（对…）作出反应；回应`) figures (that *bear*(`=you hold it or carry it with you`) far less relation to business conditions *than* they used to).

-> They took cash *in lieu of* the prize they had won. 他们没有领奖品而是领了现金。
- havoc : PHRASE If one thing *plays havoc with* another or *wreaks havoc on* it, *it prevents it from continuing or functioning as normal, or damages it*. 打乱 +

->  The weather *played havoc(n.) with* airline schedules.
天气状况打乱了航空公司的时刻表。
====

如果这种情况发生的范围足够广，微调质量而非价格的做法, 可能会严重干扰基本经济数据。统计机构竭力解释产品质量为何出现变化，但如果调整出人意料地普遍或难以觉察，那么温和的通胀数据很容易掩盖更为动荡的经济形势。各国央行关注通胀或工资增长的大幅波动，将其视为问题的征兆，但它们为之做出反应的数据与商业状况的关系,已经远没有以前那么密切。

What’s more, `主` the substitution 代替 of quality for price *as* firms’ main way of *responding to* changing market conditions `谓` *weakens* the case for keeping inflation low and stable. ② Inflation *makes* relative prices *less informative*(a.)(`=giving useful information`), economists *reckon*(`=to think sth or have an opinion about sth`), *making* it harder *to decide* what to buy /and how to spend. ② *Rather than* clarity(n.)(`=
the quality of being expressed clearly`), low inflation *has brought* a different sort of confusion: one of shrinking chocolate bars /and lost holidays.

此外，当公司以质量代替价格, 作为应对市场变化的主要手段时，维持稳定的低通胀这一做法变得理据不足。经济学家认为通胀降低了相对价格的指示性，使人们更难决定该买什么以及如何花钱。但低通胀并没有带来确定性，而是带来了另一种困惑：巧克力棒为何瘦身，假期为何消失。

Prices for many goods *do not move the way* economists think they should +
When firms *opt* to tweak a product’s quality *instead of* its price, problems *ensue*


Aug 8th 2019

[TWO YEARS ago] British chocoholics *felt* the pinch from the decision to leave the European Union. As sterling *tumbled*, global firms selling to the British market *faced* the same production costs as before, but *got less money* for each sweet sold. Rather than *raise the price* per chocolate, some *chose to shrink the chocolate* per price. The famous peaks on a bar of Toblerone *grew conspicuously less numerous* (though Mondelez, the bar’s maker, *said* {Brexit *was not* the cause}). Other products *suffered* the same “shrinkflation”: toilet rolls and toothpaste tubes *became smaller*. The threat of Brexit *made the phenomenon more visible*, but it is surprisingly common. Statisticians and policymakers *need to take note*.

Every first-year economics student *quickly becomes familiar with* charts of supply and demand, which *place* price *on* one axis /and quantity *on* the other. *Given* a drop in demand, the charts *show*, firms *can either* sell fewer items [at the prevailing price] *or* cut prices *to prop up* sales. But online retailing, which *makes it easier* to collect fine-grained price data, *reveals* how poorly textbook models *reflect* real-world market dynamics. The prices of consumer goods, it *turns out, behave oddly*.

A forthcoming paper by Diego Aparicio and Roberto Rigobon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology *helps make the point*. Firms that sell thousands of different items *do not offer them* at thousands of different prices, but rather *slot them into* a dozen or two price points. *Visit* the website for H&M, a fashion retailer, and you *will find* a staggering array of items for £9.99: hats, scarves, jewellery, belts, bags, herringbone braces, satin neckties, patterned shirts for dogs and much more. Another vast collection of items *cost* £6.99, and another, £12.99. When sellers *change* an item’s price, they *tend not to nudge it a little*, but rather *to re-slot it into* one of the pre-existing price categories. The authors *dub* this phenomenon “quantum pricing” (quantum mechanics *grew from* the observation that the properties of subatomic particles *do not vary* along a continuum, but rather *fall into* discrete states).

Just *as surprising as* the quantum way in which prices adjust *is* how rarely they move at all. `主` Retailers, Messrs Aparicio and Rigobon *suggest*, `谓` seem *to design* products *to fit* their preferred price points. *Given* a big enough shift in market conditions, such as an increase in labour costs, firms *often redesign* a product *to fit* the price rather than *tweak the price*. They *may make* a production process 宾补 less labour-intensive -- or *shave a bit off* a chocolate bar.

Central banks *are starting to see* the consequences. Inflation *does not respond to* economic conditions *as much as* it used to. (To take one example, deflation during the Great Recession *was* surprisingly mild and short-lived, and after nearly three years of unemployment below 5%, American inflation *still trundles along* below the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%.) [In its recently published annual report] the Bank for International Settlements, a club of central banks, *mused* that {quantum pricing and related phenomena *help account for* such trends}.

But firms’ aversion to increasing prices *may be as much* a consequence of limp inflation *as* a contributor to it. When the price of everything *rises a lot* year after year, as in the 1970s and 1980s, firms *can easily adjust* the real, inflation-adjusted cost of their wares *without putting off* shoppers. A 5.5% jump in the cost of a pint after years of 5% increases *does not send* beer drinkers *searching for* other pubs [in the way that a 0.5% hike(n.) after years of no change *might*]. Thus falling inflation *can make prices “stickier”*. To compensate, firms *instead(ad.) find* other ways *to impose costs on* buyers -- such as *making products smaller* or lower-quality.

Labour markets *are affected, too*. Wages *are* notoriously sticky, especially downwards. In a world of low inflation, `主` the ability *to trim pay* [by raising wages *less than* inflation] `系` *is lost(a.) to* firms, with serious macroeconomic consequences. Economists *blame* sticky wages *for* causing unemployment during recessions. *Facing* reduced demand, firms (that *cannot cut pay to maintain margins* while *slashing* prices) *instead reduce* output -- and *sack* workers.

But nimble firms *have* other options: the employment version of *shaving* a bit of chocolate *from* the bar. Some *cut* costs *by boosting output* per worker, often *by driving workers harder*. Tellingly, growth in output per worker now *tends to fall* [in booms] /and *rise* [during busts], precisely the opposite of the pattern 40 years ago, when inflation *was* high. Firms *can respond to* market pressures *by reducing the benefits* available to workers; Asda, a supermarket, recently *announced* plans *to slash* British workers’ holiday allowances. Or they *can offer* workers more tortuous schedules. Research published in 2017 *suggests* that {being able to vary(v.) workers’ hours [from week to week] *is* worth at least 20% of their wages}. On the flipside, [during good times] firms often *opt to reward workers with* office perks and one-off bonuses, *rather than* pay rises that *cannot easily be clawed back* during downturns.

The uncertainty principle
If it *happens* [on a sufficiently large scale], the practice of *tweaking* quality [*in lieu of* price] *could play havoc with* essential economic data. Statistical agencies *do their best* *to account for* changing product quality, but [if adjustments *are* unexpectedly common or subtle] then muted inflation figures *could easily be concealing* a more turbulent economic picture. Central banks (*watching for* big swings in inflation or wage growth *as* a sign of trouble) *could be reacting to* figures (that *bear* far less relation to business conditions *than* they used to).

What’s more, `主` *the substitution* of quality for price *as* firms’ main way of *responding to* changing market conditions `谓` *weakens* the case for keeping inflation low and stable. Inflation *makes* relative prices *less informative*, economists *reckon*, *making* it harder *to decide* what to buy /and how to spend. *Rather than* clarity, low inflation *has brought* a different sort of confusion: one of shrinking chocolate bars /and lost holidays.
