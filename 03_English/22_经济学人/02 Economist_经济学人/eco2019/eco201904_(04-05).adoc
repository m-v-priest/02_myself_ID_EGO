== 04. How to predict when a despot will fall


*How to predict* when a despot(`=a ruler with great power, especially one who uses it in a cruel way 专制统治者；专制君主；暴君`) *will fall*

The economy *matters*, but *so do* history and the weather

====
- despot => 来自拉丁语despota, 来自PIE dems-pota, 一家之主，dems, 家，词源同domicile. -pot, 权力，权威，词源同possible, potent. 引申词义绝对权力，暴君。

如何预测暴君何时倒台 +
经济很重要，但历史和天气也很重要


Apr 17th 2019

THE REMOVALS in the same month of two presidents -- Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria and Omar al-Bashir of Sudan -- *look like* an unforeseeable(`=that you cannot predict or foresee 无法预见的；难以预测的`) coincidence （令人吃惊的）巧合，巧事.

But they *are* also two more data points for analysts *trying to turn* the art of predicting(v.) political upheaval *into* something approaching(`=to come close to sth in amount, level or quality （在数额、水平或质量上）接近`) a science.

Some *believe* they *have* the tools *to make an attempt*.

阿尔及利亚的Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 和苏丹的Omar al-Bashir这两位总统, 在同一个月被免职，这似乎是不可预见的巧合。但对于分析师来说 -- 他们试图将"预测政治动荡"的艺术, 转变成某种更接近科学的东西 -- 这两位总统被免的事件, 也是另外两个数据点。有些人认为，他们有了尝试预测的工具。

Coups 政变 and revolutions *present* unique challenges for forecasters.

They *are* both extremely rare(a.)(`=not done, seen, happening, etc. very often 稀少的；稀罕的`) and, *notes* Andreas Beger 人名 of Predictive Heuristics(`=a method of solving problems by finding practical ways of dealing with them, learning from past experience 探索法；启发式`), a consultancy 咨询公司, by definition conspiratorial(`=connected with, or like, a conspiracy 阴谋的；密谋的；似阴谋的`) - they *do not advertise themselves* in advance.

Perhaps the most rigorous(`=done carefully and with a lot of attention to detail SYN thorough 谨慎的；细致的；彻底的; /demanding that particular rules, processes, etc. are strictly followed 严格的；严厉的`) quantitative(a.)(`=connected with the amount or number of sth rather than with how good it is 数量的；量化的；定量性的`) forecast of political upheaval *comes from* One Earth Future (OEF), an NGO *based in* Colorado （美）科罗拉多 that *publishes* a predictive(a.)(`=connected with the ability to show what will happen in the future 预测的；预言的；前瞻的`) model, CoupCast.

It *reckons that* `主` the factors *correlating most strongly with* the risk of a coup `谓` *include*: the rate of economic growth; how long a regime *has been* in power; how long since a country’s most recent coup; and whether it *has been hit by extreme weather*, such as a flood or a drought (see chart).

政变和革命, 向预测者提出了独特的挑战。它们都是极其罕见的，并且，据预测启发法咨询公司的Andreas Beger所说，根据阴谋论的定义，他们不会提前宣传自己。也许对政治动荡最严格的定量预测, 来自OEF，一个位于科罗拉多州的非政府组织，它发布了一个预测模型，CoupCast。它认为, 与政变风险最密切相关的因素包括：经济增长率；一个政权执政多长时间；一个国家最近一次政变以来, 已经有多长时间了；以及它是否受到了极端天气的影响，如洪水或干旱(见图表)。

Economic woes(`=woe : the troubles and problems that sb has 麻烦；问题；困难`) *certainly played a part in* the defenestrations(`=the act of throwing someone out of a window 将人抛出窗外`) of Mr Bouteflika and Mr Bashir.

Real annual GDP growth *has averaged just 2.8%* over the past five years in Algeria, *compared with* 3.3% for Africa *as a whole*.

Sudan’s GDP *grew(v.) at just 1.8% a year* over the same period, and last year *actually contracted*(`=to become less or smaller; to make sth become less or smaller （使）收缩，缩小`) by 2.1%. Inflation *reached* 63%.

The IMF(`=国际货币基金组织 international monetary fund`) *expects*(`=to think or believe that sth will happen or that sb will do sth 预料；预期；预计`) Sudan’s economy *to shrink* by a further 2.3% in 2019.

- woe => 感叹词。

经济困境, 当然在布特弗利卡和巴希尔的下台中, 起到了一定的作用。阿尔及利亚过去五年的实际GDP, 年平均增长率仅为2.8%，而整个非洲为3.3%。同期苏丹的GDP年增长率仅为1.8%，去年实际收缩了2.1%。通货膨胀达到63%。国际货币基金组织预计，苏丹经济将在2019年进一步收缩2.3%。


The relationship between prosperity and political stability *is* complex.

In 2015 a report from the World Bank *noted that* economic indicators alone *could not have predicted* the advent(n.)(`=the coming of an important event, person, invention, etc. （重要事件、人物、发明等的）出现，到来`) of the Arab spring in 2011.

Economies in the Middle East and north Africa *were growing steadily*. Extreme poverty and income inequality *were falling*.

繁荣与政治稳定之间的关系, 是复杂的。2015年，世界银行的一份报告指出，单凭经济指标, 无法预测2011年阿拉伯之春的到来。中东和北非的经济稳步增长。极端贫困和收入不平等正在下降。

However, despite the rosy(a.)(`=likely to be good or successful 美好的；乐观的; /pink and pleasant in appearance 粉红色的；红润的`) headline  （报纸的）大字标题 numbers, `主` surveys *conducted* 组织并实施 in the 2000s `谓` *found that* Arabs *were growing increasingly worried about* their financial prospects.

The World Bank *observes that*, though the bottom 40% of earners(`=a person who earns money for a job that they do 挣钱者；挣工资者`) in the region *were becoming richer*, the living standards of the middle 40%, who *receive less* in government transfers, *had stagnated*(`=to stop developing or making progress 停滞；不发展；不进步; /因不流动而变得污浊`).

然而，尽管总体数字乐观，但21世纪头10年进行的调查发现，阿拉伯人越来越担心自己的经济前景。世界银行观察到，尽管该地区收入最低的40%的人变得越来越富有，但中间40%的人的生活水平却停滞不前，他们在政府转移支付中获得的收入较少。

In Tunisia, where the Arab spring *began*, 23% of graduates *were unemployed* in 2010, *compared with* only 13% for the population *as a whole*. This *suggests that* a lack of opportunities *mattered* more than poverty.

在阿拉伯之春的发源地突尼斯，2010年有23%的大学毕业生失业，而整个国家的失业率只有13%。这表明缺乏机会比贫穷更重要。

Political history *matters*, too. CoupCast *finds that* both new and very old autocratic(a.)专制的；独裁的 regimes(`=a method or system of government, especially one that has not been elected in a fair way （尤指未通过公正选举的）统治方式，统治制度，政权，政体`) *are at risk of being overthrown*.

Emerging tyrants *need time to consolidate*(`=to make a position of power or success stronger so that it is more likely to continue 使加强；使巩固`) *power*.

`主` Longer-standing regimes *like those of* Mr Bouteflika and Mr Bashir `谓` *tend to fade* [as their leaders *age*].

CoupCast’s data *find that* for dictators, the “sweet spot” in terms of political stability *comes very early* in their despotism(n.)(`=the rule of a despot 专制统治；独裁制；暴政`) -- after just 18 months.

政治史也很重要。CoupCast发现，新老专制政权都有被推翻的危险。新兴的暴君需要时间来巩固权力。像布特弗利卡和巴希尔这样长期存在的政权, 随着他们的领导人年龄的增长, 而逐渐衰落。CoupCast的数据发现，对于独裁者来说，政治稳定的“最佳状态”, 在他们的专制统治中, 时间来得很早——仅仅18个月之后。

Clayton Besaw of the OEF *says that* `主` one way (dictators *have adapted(v.)(`=~ sth (for sth) to change sth in order to make it suitable for a new use or situation 使适应，使适合（新用途、新情况）`) to modern politics*) `系` *is* by choosing to hold(v.)(`=to have sth you have gained or achieved 获得；赢得`) elections.

This is a risky strategy. Winning elections *can help* legitimise(v.)(`=legitimize : to make sth legal 使合法; /to make sth that is wrong or unfair seem acceptable 使（坏事或不正当的事）看起来可以接受`) their regimes, but `主` trying to stay on [after losing] `谓` *tends to* create further instability.

Congo’s former president, for example, *rigged*(`=rig : to arrange or influence sth in a dishonest way in order to get the result that you want （以不正当的手段）操纵，控制`) a vote count(n.)(`= an act of counting to find the total number of sth; the total number that you find 数出总数；总数`) *to keep out*(`=*keep sb/sth out (of sth)* : to prevent sb/sth from entering a place 使不进入；防止进入；把…关在外面`) a rival, then *swore in*(`=*SWEAR SB IN / SWEAR SB INTO STH*: to make sb promise to do a job correctly, to be loyal to an organization, a country, etc. 使某人宣誓就职；使某人宣誓忠于某组织（或国家等）`) a successor 接替者；继任者 but *refused to move out of* the presidential villa himself.

No one *would be shocked* if Congo *had a coup* some day.

====
- rig => 来自 PIE reg,拉直，管理，词源同 rack,regulate. 引申词义帆，索具，后引申动词义操纵，控制等。

- swear : v. to make a serious promise to do sth 郑重承诺；发誓要；表示决心要 +
- *SWEAR SB IN / SWEAR SB INTO STH* : to make sb promise to do a job correctly, to be loyal to an organization, a country, etc. 使某人宣誓就职；使某人宣誓忠于某组织（或国家等） +
-> He *was sworn in* as president. 他宣誓就任总统。
====
OEF的克莱顿·贝索(Clayton Besaw)表示，独裁者适应现代政治的一种方式, 是选择举行选举。这是一种冒险的策略。赢得选举, 可以帮助他们的政权合法化，但在失败后试图留任, 往往会造成进一步的不稳定。例如，刚果前总统操纵计票以阻挡对手，然后宣誓就职继任者，但却拒绝自己搬出总统别墅。如果刚果有一天发生政变，没有人会感到震惊。

Perhaps the most likely place for the next putsch(n.)(`=a sudden attempt to remove a government by force 政变；武力夺取政权`), however, *is* Venezuela 委内瑞拉.

Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator, *has presided*(v.)(`=*~ (at/over sth)* to lead or be in charge of a meeting, ceremony, etc. 主持（会议、仪式等）；担任（会议）主席`) *over* one of the worst economic catastrophes in modern history.

The IMF *estimates that* unemployment is 44%, and *expects* inflation *to top 10,000,000%* this year.

Mr Maduro *won* an unfair election in 2013 and a blatantly(`=Blatantly is used to add emphasis when you are describing states or situations that you think are bad. 极其`) rigged (欺骗性地) 幕后操纵 one in 2018.

The legislature 立法机构; 议会 *says* he is illegitimate(a.)(`=not allowed by a particular set of rules or by law 不符合规定的；非法的`), and *that* Juan Guaidó, the head of the legislature, *should take over*(`=to begin to have control of or responsibility for sth, especially in place of sb else 接替；接任；接管；接手`), as the constitution requires, *pending*(`=to await judgment or settlement 等候判定或决定`) proper elections.

More than 50 foreign countries *recognise* Mr Guaidó *as* interim(`=intended to last for only a short time until sb/sth more permanent is found 暂时的；过渡的`) president.


====
- putsch => 来自德语putsch,政变，革命，原为拟声词，模仿击，打，轰炸的声音。
====
然而，下一次政变, 最有可能发生在委内瑞拉。委内瑞拉独裁者尼古拉斯·马杜罗(Nicolas Maduro), 造成了现代史上最严重的经济灾难之一。国际货币基金组织估计, 该国失业率为44%，今年的通货膨胀率将超过10000,000%。马杜罗在2013年赢得了一场不公平的选举，并在2018年公然操纵选举。立法机构称他是非法的，并称, 根据宪法的要求, 因由立法机构的负责人Juan Guaido在适当的选举之前, 先临时接管总统职位。50多个国家承认Guaido为临时总统。


Yet Mr Maduro *may cling*(`=*~ (on) to sb/sth /~ on/together* : to hold on tightly to sb/sth 抓紧；紧握；紧抱; /~ (to sth) : to stick to sth 粘住；附着`) grimly *on*.

Despite deep discontent among the lower ranks(`=the position that sb has in the army, navy, police, etc. 军衔；军阶；警衔`), the army’s top brass *still supports* him.

Jonathan Powell of the University of Central Florida *notes that* dictators *can make coups less likely* by *lavishing*(v.)(`=*lavish sth on/upon sb/sth* : to give a lot of sth, often too much, to sb/sth 过分给予；滥施`) cash *on* their armies /and *tampering with*(`=*TAMPER WITH STH* : to make changes to sth without permission, especially in order to damage it 篡改，擅自改动，胡乱摆弄（尤指有意破坏）`) command structures *to make it difficult* for them *to co-ordinate* 协调 rebellions(`=an attempt by some of the people in a country to change their government, using violence 谋反；叛乱；反叛`).

A study by Mr Powell *published* in 2012 `谓` *found that* such “coup-proofing 防…的；抗…的” efforts *were actually more useful to* tyrants *than* improving their countries’ economies.

Shrewdly(ad.)(`=clever at understanding and making judgements about a situation 精明的；敏锐的；有眼光的；精于盘算的`), Mr Maduro *has been showering*(`=*~ sb with sth /~ sth on sb : to give sb a lot of sth 大量地给; /（洗）淋浴`) his army *with* goodies, *giving* senior officers lucrative(a.)(`=producing a large amount of money; making a large profit 赚大钱的；获利多的`) opportunities 机会 *to embezzle*(v.)(`=to steal money that you are responsible for or that belongs to your employer 盗用，挪用，贪污，侵吞（款项）`), and *has imported* Cuban spooks(`=a spy 间谍；特工; /a ghost 鬼`) *to keep them in line*(`=If you *keep someone in line* or *bring them into line*, you make them obey you, or you make them behave in the way you want them to. 守规矩 / If one thing is *in line with* another, or is brought *into line with* it, the first thing is, or becomes, similar to the second, especially in a way that has been planned or expected. 与…一致`).

====
- tamper => 来自 tamper,混合灰泥，搅匀泥土，来自 temper 拼写变体，来自 temper,调和，调制。比喻用 法，后引申词义篡改，擅自改动。

- lucrative : a. producing a large amount of money; making a large profit 赚大钱的；获利多的 +
-> *a lucrative business/contract/market* 利润丰厚的生意╱合同╱市场

- embezzle => em-, 进入，使。-bezzle, 毁灭，吞没。
- spook => 来自荷兰语 spook,鬼怪，幽灵，词源不详，可能改写自 specter,鬼怪，幽灵。引申词义间谍 ， 特工，字面意思即内鬼。

-  If one thing is *in line with* another, or is brought *into line with* it, the first thing is, or becomes, similar to the second, especially in a way that has been planned or expected. 与…一致 +
->  This *brings the law into line with* most medical opinion. 这使得该法律与医疗界的大多数意见一致。
====

然而，马杜罗可能会顽强地坚持下去。尽管下级对他非常不满，军队的高级将领仍然支持他。中佛罗里达大学的乔纳森•鲍威尔指出，独裁者可以通过向军队投入大量资金, 和篡改指挥结构，使他们难以协调叛乱，从而降低政变发生的可能性。鲍威尔在2012年发表的一项研究发现，这种“防政变”措施实际上对暴君们更有用，而不是改善他们国家的经济。精明的是，马杜罗一直向他的军队提供大量的好处，给高级军官们贪污受贿的机会，并引进古巴间谍来控制他们。


Which country then, *has* the highest chance of *seeing* a sudden regime change? CoupCast’s latest forecast *points to* Algeria.

One of the strongest predictors of future political instability `系` *is* past instability.

Algeria *already sat at* the top of CoupCast’s rankings 时间状[*prior*(a.)(`=*prior to* :( formal ) before sth 在前面的`) *to* Mr Bouteflika’s resignation 辞职]. His sudden departure *has not made the country any less volatile*(a.)(`=(of a situation 情况) likely to change suddenly; easily becoming dangerous 可能急剧波动的；不稳定的；易恶化的`).

那么，哪个国家最有可能被看到突然的政权更迭呢? CoupCast的最新预测, 指向了阿尔及利亚。对未来政治不稳定的最有力预测因素之一, 是过去的不稳定。在布特弗利卡辞职之前，阿尔及利亚已经在CoupCast的排行榜上名列前茅。他的突然离开, 并没有使这个国家的动荡程度有所降低。

== 04. How to predict when a despot will fall

The economy *matters*, but *so do* history and the weather

Apr 17th 2019

THE REMOVALS in the same month of two presidents -- Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria /and Omar al-Bashir of Sudan -- *look like* an unforeseeable coincidence.

Apr 17th 2019 | CAIRO AND KHARTOUM

ON THE STREETS of Khartoum 喀土穆（苏丹首府）, the capital of Sudan, people *are breathing* a heady(a.)(`=having a strong effect on your senses; making you feel excited and confident 强烈作用于感官的；使兴奋的；使有信心的`) mix of fear and hope.

- heady => head,头，-y,形容词后缀。比喻用法。 +

Since April 11th, when a cabal(n.)(`=a small group of people who are involved in secret plans to get political power 政治阴谋小集团`) of army officers *pushed out*(`=*push sb out* :to make sb leave a place or an organization 驱逐；开除`) the 75-year-old Omar al-Bashir, the country’s president for the past 30 years, Sudan *has had* two more of its bloodied(a.)(`=covered in blood 血染的；有血的`) leaders *step down* 退位.

On April 12th, just a day after *taking control*, `主` Awad Ibn Auf, the defence minister and head of the self-appointed 自封的；自己任命的 “transitional(`=A transitional period is one in which things are changing from one state to another. 过渡的`) military council”(`=a group of people who are elected to govern an area such as a city or county （市、郡等的）政务委员会，地方议会`), `谓` *resigned*.

The next day, *so did* Salah Abdallah Gosh, the head of the much-feared National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).

在苏丹首都喀土穆的街道上，人们呼吸着恐惧和希望的混合气体。自从4月11日，一群军官阴谋将75岁的总统奥马尔·巴希尔赶下台以来，苏丹又有两位血淋淋的领导人下台。 +
4月12日，也就是接管政权的第二天，国防部长兼自封的“过渡军事委员会”主席阿瓦德•伊本•奥夫宣布辞职。第二天，令人生畏的国家情报和安全局(NISS)局长萨拉赫·阿布达拉·戈什也宣布辞职。


[On April 13th] the latest military leader, Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan, *announced* his intention *to “uproot”*(`= to pull a tree, plant, etc. out of the ground 将…连根拔起`) the military government, *prosecute*(`=*~ (sb) (for sth/doing sth)* : to officially charge sb with a crime in court 起诉；控告；检举`) those guilty of *killing protesters* /and *reform the NISS*.

He *has promised* *to hand power over to* civilians within two years.

`主` The protesters *camped outside* the defence ministry over the past week `谓` *have succeeded in changing their country*.

4月13日，最新的军事领导人Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan宣布他打算“铲除”军政府，起诉那些杀害抗议者的人，并改革NISS。他承诺在两年内将权力移交给平民。过去一周在国防部外安营扎寨的抗议者, 成功地改变了他们的国家。

Yet they *have plenty to worry about*. “There are so many militias(`=militia : a group of people who are not professional soldiers but who have had military training and can act as an army 民兵组织；国民卫队`), so many armed groups, it’s very scary(a.)(`=frightening 恐怖的；吓人的`),” says Hamid Murtada, an activist among those protesting.

Fights *have already broken out* between soldiers *affiliated*(`=*~ (yourself) (with sb/sth)* : to join, to be connected with, or to work for an organization 加入；与…有关；为…工作`) *with* different parts of the Sudanese state.

Gunfire *is heard* at night. `主` The soldiers now in charge(`=If you are *in charge* in a particular situation, you are the most senior person and have control over something or someone. 负责`) `谓` *might concede*(`=*~ sth (to sb) /~ sb sth* : to admit that sth is true, logical, etc. 承认（某事属实、合乎逻辑等）;/to give sth away, especially unwillingly; to allow sb to have sth （尤指勉强地）让与，让步；允许`) more *to* the protesters, perhaps even *allowing* a civilian(n.)(`=a person who is not a member of the armed forces or the police 平民；老百姓；庶民`) government *to form*. But they *might also try to break up*(`= *break sth up* : to make people leave sth or stop doing sth, especially by using force （尤指用武力）迫使放弃（某事） / to make sth separate into smaller pieces; to divide sth into smaller parts 拆开；打散`) protests *by force*, or even worse, *start fighting* each other.

然而他们有很多事情要担心。参加抗议活动的活动人士哈米德•穆尔塔达(Hamid Murtada)表示:“有这么多民兵、这么多武装组织，这非常可怕。”隶属于苏丹不同地区的士兵之间, 已经爆发了战斗。晚上可以听到枪声。现在掌权的士兵, 可能会对抗议者做出更多让步，甚至可能允许组建一个文官政府。但他们也可能试图用武力驱散抗议，或者更糟，开始互相争斗。

苏丹正在经历自2011年阿拉伯之春以来在几个国家都能看到的事情：民众反抗一位年迈的暴君，导致政权更迭。4月2日，阿尔及利亚总统阿卜杜勒阿齐兹•布特弗利卡(Abdelaziz Bouteflika)宣布辞职。现年82岁的布特弗利卡非常怠惰，以至于许多阿尔及利亚人开玩笑说他已经死了。在他告知他准备再次进行竞选后，阿尔及利亚人震惊了. 在数周的抗议活动后，他被迫下台。

Such transitions *offer hope*. They *show that* street movements *can effect*(`=to make sth happen 使发生；实现；引起`) change, even *against* brutal(`=violent and cruel 残暴的；兽性的`) regimes.

But they are also moments of great risk. `主` The fall of long-standing despots such as Mr Bashir, who *is wanted* 通缉 by the International Criminal Court *for* crimes against humanity, `系` *is* a necessary part of any transition to democracy. But it *can also start a civil war*, or *lead to* a new dictatorship(`=government by a dictator 独裁；专政; /a country that is ruled by a dictator 独裁国家`) [as the next strongman *builds his own networks of power*].

这样的转变带来了希望。他们表明，街头运动甚至可以改变残暴的政权。但这也是非常危险的时刻。像巴希尔这样的长期暴君的倒台是任何向民主过渡的必要部分。巴希尔因反人类罪被国际刑事法院通缉。但这种转变, 也可能引发一场内战，或导致一个新的独裁政权，因为下一个强人会建立自己的权力网络。

[This March] it *rigged an election* under a constitution it *had drafted* to make(v.) its grip 紧握；紧抓;（对…的）控制，影响力 on power [more or less permanent].

总的来说，事实证明，各地的军队更擅长发动政变，而不是将其真正过渡到文官统治。泰国自1932年结束绝对君主制以来，泰国军队发动了19次未遂政变(其中12次成功)，最近一次是在2014年掌权。今年3月，它根据自己起草的宪法, 操纵了一次选举，使其对权力的控制, 或多或少具有永久性。

In neighbouring Myanmar, an election and formal transfer of power in 2015 should have marked the end of more than half a century of military rule. But the constitution the army has foisted on the country guarantees it control of important ministries and enough seats in parliament to block reforms. Pakistan’s army, which ruled directly from 1999 to 2008, now relies on less formal mechanisms to ensure its continued sway over the country’s foreign policy, and to protect its economic interests.

In fact, the political turmoil witnessed in the past month bucks long-term trends. Data compiled by Hein Goemans of the University of Rochester and two other scholars `show that two-thirds of national leaders in Africa and the Middle East who lost power between 1960 and 1989 were either forced out or died of natural causes. But since then, democracy has spread. “Irregular exits”, as Mr Goemans calls them, have become much rarer. Most Arab and African leaders now leave office because they are voted out or do not stand for re-election. Analysts counted 18 attempted coups around the world in 1966 and none at all in 2007 or 2018. According to CoupCast, a predictive model based on 68 economic and other variables, Africa is the only continent where the factors that foster coups are still fairly widespread (see map).


In both Sudan and Algeria the cliques now in charge may hope to cling to power despite the change of figurehead. Under Mr Bashir, Sudan has been run less by a government and more by a cartel of different armed groups. The president, says Alex de Waal, an analyst and former peace negotiator, was “the conductor of an orchestra”. Rather than just an army, the country has half a dozen semi-formal military outfits, from the NISS to pro-government militias such as the notorious Janjaweed, responsible for mass rape and massacres in Darfur over a decade ago. Each has its own leaders and weapons. Mr Bashir stayed in power by balancing these groups against each other.

In Algeria institutions are stronger, but authority is still wielded by what Algerians call le pouvoir (the power). This is a shadowy collection of army officers, businessmen and others, continually negotiating among themselves. Any politics involving people outside this clique is crushed.

The two regimes are alike in being based not on strong, visible institutions but on invisible webs of personal relationships. Leaders are less executive decision-makers than dealmakers, playing off different factions against each other so as to keep themselves in power. Offices do not matter as much as the individuals who hold them, and the alliances they have.

Changes of leadership will bring lasting change only if they overturn this politics. Other recent coups offer worrying lessons. In 2017 in Zimbabwe, President Emmerson Mnangagwa came to power after the army forced out Robert Mugabe, who had ruled for 37 years. Mr Mnangagwa, Mr Mugabe’s former chief enforcer, impressed gullible diplomats by promising a “new dispensation” and economic reform. But his election campaign last year was violent and fraudulent. Since then, inflation has soared as promised investment failed to materialise. Renewed protests in January were bloodily put down. Mr Mnangagwa was never serious about reform. He, like Mr Mugabe, relies on a personal patronage network to maintain his grip on power.

Changing the guard
Yet some places do offer hope. In 2014, Blaise Compaoré, the president of Burkina Faso in west Africa, fled the country for Ivory Coast after protesters stormed the parliament building and set it on fire. In that instance, the army took charge but then quickly handed power to a transitional government to organise elections. In September 2015, Mr Compaoré’s supporters in the presidential guard mounted a coup, intended, ultimately, to restore him to office. But though they succeeded in taking Ouagadougou, the capital, the coup plotters eventually had to give up when it became clear that they had no international support. The planned election was held in November of that year.

Could such a thing happen in Sudan or Algeria? In Sudan the African Union (AU) is insisting that the men with guns give up power—as it did with Burkina Faso, but noticeably failed to do with Zimbabwe. On April 15th it gave Sudan’s new leaders 15 days to hand over to a “civilian-led political authority” or face suspension. The dramatic fall in the number of coups in Africa over the past two decades owes much to the AU’s refusal to accept sudden military takeovers. Unrecognised governments struggle to do much (sadly, it is less bothered about other outrages, such as rigged elections).

But even if power were handed over to civilians in Khartoum, the situation in Sudan could still prove dangerous. The protesters there are relatively well-off urbanites angry at the worsening economy. But the rest of the country is desperately poor, barely governed and awash with arms. It is held together by loose alliances, mostly organised by Mr Bashir. And since 2011, when South Sudan was given independence, Khartoum has lost the oil that is its main source of political finance. The danger is that any deal that satisfies the protesters of Khartoum will undermine the fragile half-peace in the periphery. That could stoke new rebellions that would quickly undermine any post-Bashir government. “It’s only a matter of time before Sudan falls again to military rule,” says Muhammad Osman, a Sudanese analyst.

One possible outcome is that the army finds more external sponsorship. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would probably bail the new rulers out, in exchange for protection of their interests, chiefly the continued participation of Sudanese soldiers in the Saudi-led coalition in the war in Yemen. With an infusion of new cash, the delicate balancing-act between Sudan’s various armed forces that Mr Bashir had maintained might become somewhat easier. But there is every risk that a miscalculation might spark conflict, especially if one faction feels that it may have to face retribution for its role in previous violence. “People will shoot and defend themselves,” says Harry Verhoeven, an academic and the author of a book, “Water, Civilisation and Power in Sudan”. “These are people who owe everything to this system and the impunity it gave them.”

In Algeria the end of the protest movement already seems nigh. On April 12th police tried to take back the streets of Algiers, the capital, by blocking roads into the city. When that failed, they used water-cannon and tear-gas to drive demonstrators away. Mr Bouteflika’s downfall may usher in some change. But it will take longer than a few weeks. Only when a state has a broad base of support, and power vested in institutions rather than individuals, can a country really be coup-proofed. In Khartoum the people on the street speak of revolution. But they fear failure. “This might all be a game,” says Mr Murtada, the activist. “We can’t leave until we know the plan…We cannot trust the military at all.” Sadly, neither can they trust anyone else.

== 05. Sudan and Algeria overthrow despots but not their political systems 纯净版

Both could end up with new rulers much like the old ones


Apr 17th 2019 | CAIRO AND KHARTOUM
ON THE STREETS of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, people are breathing a heady mix of fear and hope. Since April 11th, when a cabal of army officers pushed out the 75-year-old Omar al-Bashir, the country’s president for the past 30 years, Sudan has had two more of its bloodied leaders step down. On April 12th, just a day after taking control, Awad Ibn Auf, the defence minister and head of the self-appointed “transitional military council”, resigned. The next day, so did Salah Abdallah Gosh, the head of the much-feared National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).

On April 13th the latest military leader, Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan, announced his intention to “uproot” the military government, prosecute those guilty of killing protesters and reform the NISS. He has promised to hand power over to civilians within two years. The protesters camped outside the defence ministry over the past week have succeeded in changing their country.

Yet they have plenty to worry about. “There are so many militias, so many armed groups, it’s very scary,” says Hamid Murtada, an activist among those protesting. Fights have already broken out between soldiers affiliated with different parts of the Sudanese state. Gunfire is heard at night. The soldiers now in charge might concede more to the protesters, perhaps even allowing a civilian government to form. But they might also try to break up protests by force, or even worse, start fighting each other.

Sudan is experiencing something seen in several countries since the Arab spring of 2011: popular protests against an ageing despot precipitating regime change. It follows Algeria, which on April 2nd learned of the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, an 82-year-old so inactive that many Algerians joke he is dead. He was forced out by weeks of protests after he informed horrified Algerians that he planned to stand for re-election yet again.

Such transitions offer hope. They show that street movements can effect change, even against brutal regimes. But they are also moments of great risk. The fall of long-standing despots such as Mr Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, is a necessary part of any transition to democracy. But it can also start a civil war, or lead to a new dictatorship as the next strongman builds his own networks of power.

In general, armies everywhere have proven better at staging coups than at managing genuine transitions to civilian rule. Thailand’s army, which has mounted 19 attempted coups (12 of them successful) since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, most recently took power in 2014. This March it rigged an election under a constitution it had drafted to make its grip on power more or less permanent. In neighbouring Myanmar, an election and formal transfer of power in 2015 should have marked the end of more than half a century of military rule. But the constitution the army has foisted on the country guarantees it control of important ministries and enough seats in parliament to block reforms. Pakistan’s army, which ruled directly from 1999 to 2008, now relies on less formal mechanisms to ensure its continued sway over the country’s foreign policy, and to protect its economic interests.

苏丹和阿尔及利亚推翻的是暴君，而不是他们的政治制度
这两个国家最终都可能产生新的统治者，就像旧的统治者一样
2019年4月17日，开罗和喀土穆
在苏丹首都喀土穆的街道上，人们呼吸着恐惧和希望的混合气体。4月11日，一群军官将75岁的Omar al-Bashir赶下了台，他是苏丹过去30年的总统。4月12日，也就是接管政权的第二天，国防部长兼自封的“过渡军事委员会”主席阿瓦德•伊本•奥夫宣布辞职。第二天，令人生畏的国家情报和安全局(NISS)局长萨拉赫·阿布达拉·戈什也宣布辞职。
4月13日，最新的军事领导人Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan宣布他打算“铲除”军政府，起诉那些杀害抗议者的人，并改革NISS。他承诺在两年内将权力移交给平民。过去一周在国防部外安营扎寨的抗议者成功地改变了他们的国家。
然而他们有很多事情要担心。参加抗议活动的活动人士哈米德•穆尔塔达(Hamid Murtada)表示:“有这么多民兵、这么多武装组织，这非常可怕。”隶属于苏丹不同地区的士兵之间已经爆发了战斗。晚上可以听到枪声。现在掌权的士兵可能会对抗议者做出更多让步，甚至可能允许组建一个文官政府。但他们也可能试图用武力驱散抗议，或者更糟的是，开始互相争斗。
自2011年“阿拉伯之春”以来，苏丹正在经历一些国家所经历的事情:民众抗议一位年迈的暴君，导致政权更迭。4月2日，阿尔及利亚总统阿卜杜勒阿齐兹•布特弗利卡(Abdelaziz Bouteflika)宣布辞职。现年82岁的布特弗利卡非常怠惰，以至于许多阿尔及利亚人开玩笑说他已经死了。在他告知震惊的阿尔及利亚人他计划再次竞选连任后，由于数周的抗议活动，他被迫下台。
这样的转变带来了希望。他们表明，街头运动甚至可以改变残暴的政权。但它们也是存在巨大风险的时刻。巴希尔因反人类罪被国际刑事法庭通缉，他这样的长期暴君的倒台是任何向民主过渡的必要组成部分。但它也可能引发一场内战，或导致一个新的独裁政权，因为下一个强人会建立自己的权力网络。
总的来说，事实证明，各地的军队更擅长发动政变，而不是真正过渡到文官统治。自1932年结束绝对君主制以来，泰国军队发动了19次未遂政变(其中12次成功)，最近一次是在2014年掌权。今年3月，它根据自己起草的宪法操纵了一次选举，使其对权力的控制或多或少具有永久性。在邻国缅甸，2015年的选举和权力的正式移交本应标志着半个多世纪的军事统治的结束。但是军队强加给国家的宪法保证军队控制重要的部门和足够的议会席位来阻止改革。巴基斯坦军队从1999年到2008年直接统治国家，现在依靠不那么正式的机制来确保其对国家外交政策的持续影响力，并保护其经济利益。
事实上，过去一个月的政治动荡与长期趋势背道而驰。由罗切斯特大学的Hein Goemans和其他两位学者汇编的数据显示，在1960年至1989年间失去权力的非洲和中东国家领导人中，有三分之二要么是被迫下台，要么是自然死亡。但从那时起，民主开始传播。戈曼斯先生所称的“不定期退场”已经越来越少了。大多数阿拉伯和非洲国家的领导人现在下台，因为他们被选民淘汰，或者不再竞选连任。分析人士指出，1966年全球有18次政变企图，2007年或2018年一次也没有。根据基于68个经济和其他变量的预测模型CoupCast，非洲是唯一一个导致政变的因素仍然相当普遍的大陆(见地图)。

在苏丹和阿尔及利亚，尽管有名无实，但现在掌权的派系可能希望继续掌权。在巴希尔先生的领导下，苏丹的管理更多的是由不同的武装组织组成的卡特尔，而不是政府。分析人士、前和平谈判代表亚历克斯•德•瓦尔(Alex de Waal)表示，总统是“管弦乐队的指挥”。不仅仅是一支军队，这个国家还有6个半正式的军事组织，从NISS到支持政府的民兵组织，比如臭名昭著的Janjaweed，他们要为十多年前在达尔富尔的大规模强奸和屠杀负责。每个国家都有自己的领导人和武器。巴希尔通过平衡这些组织来维持权力。
阿尔及利亚的机构更强大，但权力仍然掌握在阿尔及利亚人所谓的le pouvoir(权力)手中。这是一个由军官、商人和其他人组成的影子集合，他们不断地在彼此之间进行谈判。任何涉及这个小集团之外的人的政治都会被粉碎。
这两种制度的相似之处在于，它们都不是建立在强大的、看得见的制度之上，而是建立在无形的人际关系网络之上。领导者与其说是行政决策者，不如说是交易撮合者，他们利用不同派系之间的对立来维持自己的权力。办公室并不像它的拥有者和联盟那样重要。
只有推翻这种政治，领导层的变化才会带来持久的变化。最近的其他政变也提供了令人担忧的教训。2017年，津巴布韦总统埃默森·姆南加古瓦(Emmerson Mnangagwa)在军队驱逐统治了37年的罗伯特·穆加贝(Robert Mugabe)之后上台执政。穆南加古瓦先生，穆加贝先生的前主要执行者，通过承诺“新的分配”和经济改革给轻信的外交官留下了深刻的印象。但他去年的竞选活动充满了暴力和欺诈。自那以来，由于承诺的投资未能兑现，通胀飙升。一月份再次爆发的抗议活动被血腥镇压。姆南加古瓦从未认真对待改革。他和穆加贝一样，依靠个人赞助网络来维持对权力的控制。
改变了警卫
然而，有些地方确实带来了希望。2014年，西非国家布基纳法索的总统领导人布莱斯·孔波雷(Blaise Compaore)在抗议者袭击议会大楼并纵火焚烧后逃离该国，前往科特迪瓦。在那次事件中，军方接管了政权，但随后迅速将权力移交给过渡政府来组织选举。2015年9月，孔波雷在总统卫队中的支持者发动了一场政变，最终目的是让他重返总统宝座。但是，尽管政变策划者成功地占领了首都瓦加杜古，但当他们发现没有国际支持时，他们最终不得不放弃。计划中的选举在那年11月举行。
这种事情会发生在苏丹或阿尔及利亚吗?在苏丹，非洲联盟(AU)坚持要求持有枪支的人放弃权力，就像它对布基纳法索所做的那样，但很明显没有对津巴布韦这样做。4月15日，它给了苏丹新领导人15天的时间来移交给“文官领导的政治当局”，否则将面临停职。过去二十年非洲政变数量的急剧下降很大程度上是由于非盟拒绝接受突然的军事接管。不被承认的政府很难有所作为(可悲的是，它很少为其他暴行所困扰，比如被操纵的选举)。
但是，即使权力移交给喀土穆的平民，苏丹的局势仍然可能是危险的。那里的抗议者是相对富裕的城市居民，他们对不断恶化的经济感到愤怒。但是这个国家的其他地方却极度贫困，几乎没有政府管理，武器泛滥。它由松散的联盟组织在一起，其中大部分是由巴希尔先生组织的。自2011年南苏丹获得独立以来，喀土穆失去了作为其主要政治资金来源的石油。危险在于，任何让喀土穆抗议者满意的协议，都将破坏周边脆弱的半和平状态。这可能会引发新的叛乱，很快就会破坏任何后巴希尔时代的政府。苏丹分析家穆罕默德•奥斯曼说:“苏丹再次落入军事统治只是时间问题。”

一个可能的结果是，军方获得了更多的外部支持。沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国可能会为新统治者纾困，以换取对他们利益的保护，主要是让苏丹士兵继续参与沙特领导的也门战争联盟。随着新资金的注入，巴希尔先生一直维持的苏丹各武装部队之间微妙的平衡行动可能会变得稍微容易一些。但是每一个错误的估计都可能引发冲突，特别是当一个派别认为它可能要为之前的暴力行为受到惩罚的时候。学者、《苏丹的水、文明与权力》一书的作者哈里•弗胡芬表示:“人们会开枪并自卫。”“这些人把一切都归功于这个体系，以及它让他们免受惩罚。”
在阿尔及利亚，抗议运动似乎已经接近尾声。4月12日，警察试图通过封锁通往首都阿尔及尔的道路来夺回首都的街道。当失败后，他们用高压水枪和催泪瓦斯驱赶示威者。布特弗利卡的下台可能会带来一些变化。但这将需要比几周更长的时间。只有当一个国家拥有广泛的支持基础，权力属于机构而不是个人时，一个国家才能真正做到不受政变影响。在喀土穆，街头的人们谈论着革命。但他们害怕失败。“这可能完全是一场游戏，”活动人士Murtada先生说。“在我们知道计划之前，我们不能离开……我们根本不能信任军队。”可悲的是，他们也不能相信任何人。
