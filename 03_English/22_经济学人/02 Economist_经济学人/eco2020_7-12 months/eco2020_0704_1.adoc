(eco 2020-7-4 / United States / The presidential election: Donald Trump’s uphill battle)


Donald Trump *faces a much bigger task* than he did in 2016

The polls 民意调查,选举投票；计票, `political fundamentals` and `key voters` 选民 *have all turned against* the president

Jul 2nd 2020 |


DONALD TRUMP’S path to re-election *has never looked more difficult*. [In early June] his deficit 赤字；逆差；亏损 in the polls against Joe Biden *was “just” six percentage points*. That *may seem large*, but *it is close enough* for the president *to conceivably(ad.)可想象的；可信的 gain the ground* 逼近，迫近（正在移动或做某事的人或物） *required to win* an electoral-college 选举团 victory, even *with* a minority of `the popular vote` 普选；直接投票. He *needs to hold* Mr Biden *to a two- to three-point margin* to do so. But nationwide protests, the growing reality of `the country’s economic turmoil` 动乱；骚动；混乱；焦虑 and `a rapidly spreading rebound 回升；反弹 of covid-19 cases` *have pushed him even farther behind*.

- *gain/make up ground (on sb/sth)* : to gradually get closer to sb/sth that is moving or making progress in an activity 逼近，迫近（正在移动或做某事的人或物）
.. The police car *was gaining ground on the suspects*. 警车渐渐逼近犯罪嫌疑人。
.. They needed *to make up ground on their competitors*. 他们必须穷追猛赶竞争对手。

- *electoral college* : N-SING The electoral college is the system that is used in the United States in presidential elections. The electors in the electoral college act as representatives for each state, and they elect the president and vice president. (美国各州选出总统和副总统的大选)选举团

- 唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)的连任之路, 看起来从未像现在这样艰难。6月初，他在民调中与乔·拜登的差距“只有”6个百分点。这看起来可能很大，但可以想象，即使是在普选中只获得少数选票，总统也可以获得赢得选举团胜利所需的优势。但他需要让拜登仅保持两到三个百分点的优势才能做到这一点。但全国范围内的抗议活动、该国经济动荡日益加剧的现实, 以及covid-19病例迅速蔓延的情况反弹，使他的支持率进一步落后。



Today *he faces a nine-point uphill 上坡的;漫长而艰难的，费力的（战斗、斗争、任务等） climb nationally* and *is behind by between four and eight points* in `the bellwether(n.)征兆；前导 states` 大选领头羊州. The president *even acknowledged* his dire(a.)极其严重的；危急的;极糟的；极差的 situation *in an interview with Fox News* last week, *saying* “Joe Biden *is gonna be your president* because some people *don’t love me*, maybe.” According to The Economist’s election-forecasting model, Mr Trump *has a one-in-nine chance* of winning(v.) a second term -- *down from a one-in-five* shot(v.)（在整场比赛中）击出…杆 last month.

- *the bellwether state*：美国大选胜选前导州，俗称“大选领头羊州”。 +
bellwether 是“领队”、“领头羊”（羊脖子上挂只铃，带领羊群择路而行）的意思。The bellwether state 是指在美国大选投票年，该州连续数年所投的总统候选人, 中选率高，有带领全国其他州投票胜选趋势的州。*这个词原来特指密苏里州，因为该州在1904~2004这一百年间的总统选举中，仅有一次“失算”*（1956年）。

- 如今，他在全国面临着9个百分点的差距，在大选领头羊州也落后4到8个百分点。


The president *is struggling* for at least three reasons. First, he *has always relied on* defacing(v.)损伤…的外貌（尤指乱涂、乱写）;丑化，毁坏 his opponents. In 2016 he *succeeded* in *making* Hillary Clinton *unacceptable 不能接受的；不受欢迎的 to* a slightly bigger share of the electorate （一国或一地区的）全体选民 *than* the minority 少数；少数派；少数人 that actually liked him. His job *was made easier* by her low favourability ratings. According to a poll *conducted by* YouGov on the eve of the election, Mr Trump *was rated favourably(ad.)肯定的；赞同的；支持的 [by 39% of American adults]*, *compared with* Mrs Clinton’s 41%; `主` the shares (who *viewed(v.) them unfavourably*) `系` *were* 60% and 57%, respectively. Of course, Mr Trump *did not have to convince*  使确信；使相信；使信服 a majority of all American voters *that* he *was preferable(a.)较适合；更可取 to* the former `secretary of state`: his victory *depended on* persuading(v.) a majority of mostly white voters (in the Midwest) *to opt(v.) for him*.

- 总统的困境至少有三个原因。首先，他一直依赖于诋毁对手。2016年，他成功地让希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)在选民中不受欢迎的比例，略高于真正喜欢他的少数选民。由于她的好评率很低，他的工作轻松多了。根据YouGov在大选前夕进行的一项民意调查，美国成年人对特朗普的支持率是39%, 希拉里的是41%;而不喜欢他们的比例分别为60%和57%。当然，特朗普不必说服所有美国选民中的大多数，来让他们相信他比这位前国务卿更可取:他的胜利取决于说服以白人为主的中西部选民中的大多数来选择他。

Mr Trump’s strategy *worked* (if `主` *losing* the popular vote 直接投票,普选 by 3m ballots  选票 `谓` *can be counted as* working) last time round, when his opponent *was already extremely unpopular*. But [from the start] *it looked a dicey*(a.)前途未卜的；冒险的；危险的
*bet 打赌 against* Mr Biden, who is far more popular *than* Mrs Clinton was. According to YouGov’s interviews of 1,500 Americans [*between* June 21st *and* June 23rd], `43% of adults *view*(v.) the former vice-president *favourably*` and `only slightly more (47%) *dislike* him`. Mr Trump’s ratings *are much harsher* 残酷的；严酷的；严厉的: 42% *like him* and 53% *do not*. The president’s handling of the pandemic, in particular, *makes it hard to imagine* he *has much room for improvement here*.


- dicey : /ˈdaɪsi/ a. ( informal ) uncertain and dangerous SYN risky 前途未卜的；冒险的；危险的 +
=> 来自dice, 骰子，即赌博的，前途末卜的。比较hazard, aleatory.

- 特朗普的策略在上次大选中奏效了(如果把300万张选票之差输掉普选, 也看做是"凑效"的话)，当时他的对手已经非常不得人心。但从一开始，与拜登对赌就显得有些冒险，拜登的人气远高于希拉里。根据YouGov在6月21日至23日对1500名美国人的采访，43%的成年人对这位前副总统持好感态度，只有略高的47%的人不喜欢他。特朗普的支持率则更糟:42%的人喜欢他，53%的人不喜欢他。特别是总统对疫情的处理，很难想象他在这方面还有很大的改进空间。


Second, Mr Trump *is being dragged down* 使虚弱（或不愉快）;使社会地位（或经济地位、行为标准等）下降 by the dramatic movement of older voters, *horrified* by the now-exploding spread of covid-19, *away from him*. Overall, Mr Biden’s vote margin *has increased by about five points* over Mrs Clinton’s final performance in 2016 among people (who *voted [last time round]*), according to an analysis of YouGov’s data. Voters (over 65) *have led the charge*  突然猛冲；猛攻；冲锋; their vote margin for Mr Biden *is six points better than* Mrs Clinton’s was, whereas that of voters under 30 *has not budged （使）轻微移动，挪动; （使）改变主意，改变观点 at all*. White voters *have also fled* Mr Trump’s ranks （警察、士兵等的）队列，行列 [*in much larger numbers*] *than* voters of colour. Mr Biden *is seven points ahead of* Mrs Clinton’s position [*among whites*], while Hispanics 讲西班牙语的美国居民（尤指拉美裔美国人） *have moved six points towards Trump* (though they *still overwhelmingly oppose him*).

- budge :  /bʌdʒ/ v. to move slightly; to make sth/sb move slightly （使）轻微移动，挪动 / to change your opinion about sth; to make sb change their opinion （使）改变主意，改变观点 +
=> 词源同boil, 沸腾，膨胀。插入字母d.
.. She pushed at the door *but it wouldn't budge*. 她推了推门，门却一动不动。

- 其次，特朗普正被年纪较大的选民的戏剧性运动拖垮，这些选民对新冠肺炎(covid-19)目前的爆炸性传播感到恐惧，远离他。一项对YouGov数据的分析显示，总体而言，在上次投票的选民中，拜登的得票率比希拉里在2016年最后一轮的表现高出约5个百分点。65岁以上的选民带头冲锋;他们对拜登的支持比希拉里多了6个百分点，而30岁以下选民的支持却没有任何变化。白人选民逃离特朗普阵营的人数也远远超过有色人种选民。拜登在白人中的支持率领先希拉里7个百分点，而西班牙裔则向特朗普靠拢6个百分点(尽管他们仍然压倒性地反对特朗普)。


Third and most important, the president has lost ground with non-college 不在上大学的；未上过大学的 white voters. This group *was* Mr Trump’s seawall 海塘；防波堤 in 2016; it *prevented* a tide of national ballots （无记名）投票选举；投票表决 *from breaching 在…上打开缺口;违反；违背 his electoral-college 总统选举团 victory*. But this time these voters *have moved* eight points *towards* his opponent. [In swing states] their shift *is* a more modest 些许的；不太大（或太贵、太重要等）的 six percentage points; but [in those close contests] 势均力敌的比赛;比分接近的比赛, such a change, if it *sticks* 粘贴；粘住; （在某物中）卡住，陷住，动不了, *would imperil* 使陷于危险；危及 Mr Trump. He *has also lost ground* among Christians -- both of the evangelical 基督教福音派的 and mainline(a.)传统的；主流的 varieties  品种；种类.

- 第三，也是最重要的一点，总统已经失去了没上过大学的白人选民的支持。这个群体曾是特朗普在2016年的防波堤;它阻止了一波全国性的投票破坏他在选举人团选举中的胜利。但这次, 这些选民已经向他的对手贡献了8个百分点的支持率。在摇摆州，他们的转变稍小一些，为6个百分点;但在那些势均力敌的竞选中，这种变化如果持续下去，将危及特朗普。他也失去了在福音派和主流基督徒中的支持。


*It is unclear* why white voters without a college degree *have been the most likely to leave* Mr Trump’s camp. Some clues 线索，迹象 *may be found* in this year’s Democratic presidential `primary elections` 初选；预选, *in which* non-college whites *were also the most likely to leave* Bernie Sanders’s wing （起某种作用或持相同观点的）派，翼 of the party. *It is likely that* Mr Biden *represents* a more appealing candidacy 候选人的资格（或身份） *to* these voters *than* Mrs Clinton did. Social scientists *have found that* these voters *tend to be more racially conservative* 保守的；守旧的 and *harbour(v.) 怀有，心怀（尤指反面感情或想法） more hostile views about* feminism 女权主义；女权运动 *than others do*. Mr Biden’s candidacy 候选人的资格（或身份） *has focused less on* the politics of diversity 多样性；多样化 and empowerment(n.)权利赋予 *than* Mrs Clinton’s before him.

- wing :n.[ C ] one section of an organization that has a particular function or whose members share the same opinions （起某种作用或持相同观点的）派，翼
SYN arm
.. *the radical wing* of the party 这个政党中的激进派

- empowerment : N-UNCOUNT The empowerment of a person or group of people is the process of giving them power and status in a particular situation. 权利赋予
.. This government believes very strongly in *the empowerment of women*. 这届政府坚信赋权于妇女。

- 为什么没有大学学位的白人选民, 会最有可能离开特朗普的阵营, 这个原因并不清楚。但在今年的民主党总统初选中，我们可以找到一些线索。在初选中，无大学学历的白人也是最有可能离开伯尼•桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)所在党派的人。对这些选民来说，拜登来当候选人身份, 可能比希拉里更有吸引力。社会科学家发现，这些选民在种族上更保守，对女权主义怀有更多的敌意。拜登的候选人身份, 他不像其"前任"克林顿夫人那样, 注重政治的多样性和赋权给女性。


Whatever the reason, Mr Trump *has lost most support* [among his `stalwart(a.)忠诚的；忠实的 backers`] from 2016. That *may mean*, when it *comes down to*  (问题、决定等)归结为 it, *that* {they are likelier *than* many now imagine *to swing back to him* on voting day}. Perhaps they will. But according to YouGov’s data, the president’s defectors 背叛者；逃兵；叛离者 *are more likely than others* to have voted(v.) in the Democratic primaries （美国）初选 this year -- a sign (that many *may have been Democrats* who *did not like* Mrs Clinton). They are also 14 percentage points *more likely than other voters* to believe(v.) that {`race relations` *have grown worse* during Mr Trump’s tenure （尤指重要政治职务的）任期，任职}, and a whopping(a.)巨大的；很大的 22 points *likelier to disapprove of* how he *has handled the coronavirus*. Even worse for Mr Trump, they *are 30% more likely than other voters* to say(v.) {their personal finances *have deteriorated* 变坏；恶化；退化 over the past year}.

- stalwart : /ˈstɔːlwərt/ a.n. =>  拼写变体形式自 stalworth,坚定的，坚决的，等同于 stall,固定位置，地方，worth,价值。

- *come down to* : (PHRASAL VERB) (问题、决定等)归结为 If a problem, decision, or question comes down to a particular thing, that thing is the most important factor involved.
.. Walter Crowley says **the problem comes down to mone**y...
沃尔特·克劳利说，归根结底就是钱的问题。

- whopping : a. ( ˈwhopping great ) [ only before noun ] ( informal ) very big 巨大的；很大的
.. The company *made a whopping 75 million dollar loss*. 公司遭受了7 500万元的巨额损失。

- 不管出于什么原因，特朗普已经失去了2016年以来其坚定支持者中的大部分人。这可能意味着，当涉及到这一点时，他们比许多人现在想象的更有可能在投票日回到他身边。也许他们会的。但根据YouGov的数据，总统的叛逃者比其他人, 更有可能在今年的民主党初选中投票——这个迹象表明, 其中许多人可能是民主党人, 他们只是不喜欢希拉里。与其他选民相比，他们也高出了14个百分点认为, 种族关系在特朗普任期内恶化了, 他们也不赞同特朗普对新冠病毒的处理方式, 这比其他选民高出22个百分点. 对特朗普来说更糟糕的是，他们比其他选民高出30%, 更有可能说自己的个人财务状况, 在过去一年里恶化了。


So [on all the issues (*most important to voters*(n.) at the moment)], these voters *rate(v.) Mr Trump poorly*. Though they *could move back to him*, [at present] their defection 反水,倒戈,叛逃 *has pushed* Mr Trump *to* `clear(a.) underdog(n.)处于劣势的人（或团队、国家等）；弱者；比赛前不被看好者 status`. *It has also raised a distinct 清晰的；清楚的；明白的；明显的 possibility that* he *could lose by a landslide*(n.)（山坡或悬崖的）崩塌，塌方，滑坡，地滑;一方选票占压倒多数的选举；一方占绝对优势的选举.

- 因此，在眼下对选民最重要的所有问题上，这些选民对特朗普的评价都很低。尽管他们可能会回到特朗普身边，但目前他们的倒戈, 已将特朗普推向明显的失败者地位。这也明显增加了他以绝对优势落败的可能性。


Mr Trump’s allies *have raised the possibility that* he *could win* round （将数字调高或调低）使成为整数；把（数字）四舍五入 enough `undecided(a.)未拿定主意；犹豫不决 voters` *to muster*(v.)集合，召集，集结（尤指部队） an electoral-college victory *again*. Such voters *are* a natural crutch(n.)依靠；依赖;（腿或脚受伤病人用的）腋杖 *for* the campaign: `主` wishy-washy （思想或信仰）稀里糊涂的，不清楚的，不坚定的 voters (who last time *held their breath* until the “October surprise” from James Comey, (the FBI director who *announced* a resumption 重新开始；继续进行；恢复 of the investigation into Mrs Clinton’s emails)), `谓` perhaps *came to 达到（某状况，尤指坏的局面） Mr Trump’s rescue* 救援；营救；抢救；获救. But the president’s campaign *faces even more bad news* on this front.

- crutch : /krʌtʃ/ one of two long sticks that you put under your arms to help you walk after you have injured your leg or foot （腿或脚受伤病人用的）腋杖 +
=> 词源同crook,crotch. +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/c/crutch.jpg[100,100]

- wishy-washy : /ˈwɪʃi wɑːʃi/ => 来自 washy 的同韵构词，稀释的，薄的，引申词义稀里糊涂的。

- 特朗普的盟友提出了这样一种可能性:他可以将那些尚处在犹豫中的选民, 赢得差不多足够的数量，从而再次赢得选举人团的选举。这样的选民是特朗普竞选的天然支柱: 上次, 当联邦调查局(FBI)的局长詹姆斯•科米(James Comey), 宣布重启对希拉里电子邮件的调查, 即所谓的"10月惊喜"之后, 这些犹豫中的选民才松了一口气, 从而可能挽救了特朗普的选举. 但在这方面, 总统的竞选面临着更多的坏消息。




*Never tell me* the odds

According to YouGov’s polling, this year’s `undecided voters` *are more likely to be* young, non-white and college-educated (all factors that *correlate with* *voting(v.) for* Democrats). Few *are* conservatives; 64% *voted* in this year’s Democratic `primary elections`. Of those (with an opinion about the president), 63% *disapprove of* his time in office, and *they are more likely* to oppose(v.) him [*on* `race relations` 种族关系, covid-19 and the economy] *than* they are to support him.

- 根据YouGov的民调，今年犹豫不决的选民更有可能是年轻、非白人和受过大学教育的人(所有这些因素都与投票给民主党相关)。保守派寥寥无几；64%的人在今年的民主党初选中投了票。在对总统有意见的人中，63%的人不赞成他当政时做的事，他们更有可能在种族关系、新冠肺炎和经济问题上反对他，而不是支持他。

This *puts* Mr Trump *in a serious bind* 窘境;陷于困境；进退维谷. [*For* each `undecided voter` (he *could win to* his cause （支持或为之奋斗的）事业，目标，思想)], he *would probably cause*(v.)two others *to vote against him*. *The same is true* for non-voters 投票弃权者；不投票者. According to YouGov’s data, `主` voting-eligible 有资格的；合格的 Americans who *did not cast ballots* 选票 in 2016 `谓` *oppose* the president *by 20 percentage points*.

- *in a bind* : ( NAmE ) in a difficult situation that you do not know how to get out of 陷于困境；进退维谷

- 这让特朗普陷入了严重的困境。他每争取到一位支持他的尚犹豫中的选民，就可能会导致另外两个人投票反对他。对于不投票的人来说也是如此。根据YouGov的数据，2016年, 有投票资格但未去投票的美国人, 反对总统的比例为20个百分点。


Many political pundits 权威; 专家 *were stunned* by Mr Trump’s upset(n.)(竞赛)意外的结果；爆冷门 victory in 2016. Mr Comey *himself confessed* 供认，坦白，承认（错误或罪行） *to being [so] sure of* the outcome of the contest *[that]* he *took unprecedented 前所未有的；空前的；没有先例的 steps against* one candidate (which *may have ended up costing* her the election). But `主` the statistical model (The Economist *built* to predict(v.) presidential elections) `谓` *would not have been so shocked*. *Run retroactively 追溯地；逆动地 on* the last cycle, it *would have given* Mr Trump *a 27% chance* of winning the contest on election day. In July of 2016 *it would have given him* a 30% shot.

- pundit : /ˈpʌndɪt/ => 来自印度语pandit,智者，大师。

- 许多政治专家对特朗普在2016年的意外获胜感到震惊。科米自己也承认，他对选举结果如此确信，以至于对一位候选人采取了前所未有的反对措施(这可能导致她在选举中失利)。但《经济学人》为预测总统选举而建立的统计模型, 不会对此很震惊。如果回溯到上一轮，模型显示特朗普有27%的机会在选举日赢得选举。在2016年7月，他有30%的机会获胜。

This time our model *points [with much greater confidence] to* a defeat 失败；战败 *for Mr Trump*. Today, *it gives him just an 11% chance* of winning re-election in November. *It is not impossible that* he *could pull it off* 成功完成，做成（困难的事情）. Fans of poker 扑克牌游戏 *will know that* `closing an inside straight` (which *happens* in 9% of hands) *happens frequently enough to take seriously*. *It should be taken especially seriously* when the leadership of the free world *is at stake* 成败难料；得失都可能；有风险.

- *at stake* : that can be won or lost, depending on the success of a particular action 成败难料；得失都可能；有风险
.. We cannot afford to take risks *when peoples' lives are at stake*. 现在人命交关，不容我们有闪失。

- never draw to *an inside straight* : 是扑克的术语：简单地说也就是如果你的顺子缺的是中间的一张牌的话, 就不要博了，因为几率太小，如果缺的是边上的牌子，则几率大了一倍。

- 这一次，我们的模型更有信心地认为特朗普会失败。如今，他只有11%的机会赢得11月的连任。他要做到这一点并不是不可能的。扑克迷们都知道，closing an inside straight (9%的牌中会发生)发生得足够频繁，值得认真对待。当自由世界的领导权岌岌可危时，我们尤其应该认真对待这个问题。


But *is* Mr Trump *capable of* doing `what is needed to win`? He *would have to take* `the country’s ever-worsening outbreak of covid-19` *seriously*, *change his tone and actions* on `racial justice` and *pursue economic policies* that *reverse* the coronavirus-induced 引起 depression ((renewed growth *would certainly be* a boon *to his prospects* 成功的机会；前景；前途)). And then he *would have to perform the nearly impossible task* of *making himself appear(v.) more moderate and likeable* than his opponent. Mr Biden *is routinely 例行地; 常规性地 achieving 50% support* in opinion polls, *far higher than* Mrs Clinton or Barack Obama *managed* 完成（困难的事）；勉力完成 in 2016 or 2012.

- manage : v. to succeed in doing sth, especially sth difficult 完成（困难的事）；勉力完成
.. *We couldn't have managed* without you. 没有你，我们就办不成了。

- 但特朗普有能力做赢得大选所必须要达到的事情吗?他必须认真对待这个国家不断恶化的covid-19疫情，改变他在种族公正问题上的语气和行动，并推行扭转由冠状病毒引发的萧条的经济政策(恢复经济增长肯定会对他的连任前景有利)。然后，他必须完成一项几乎不可能完成的任务，即让自己看起来比对手更温和、更讨人喜欢。在民意调查中，拜登常规性地获得了50%的支持率，远高于希拉里或巴拉克•奥巴马在2016年或2012年的支持率。


All this *puts* Mr Trump *on a path (to* `a resounding 响亮的；嘹亮的；回响的; 巨大的；令人瞩目的 rebuke 指责；批评 of his presidency` in November). Every day (that *passes* [without a course-correction 航向修正]) *increases* the likelihood 可能；可能性 of his defeat.

- resounding : a. very great 巨大的；令人瞩目的
SYN emphatic
.. *a resounding victory*/win/defeat 巨大的胜利╱成功╱失败

- rebuke  : /rɪˈbjuːk/ [ VN ] *~ sb (for sth/for doing sth)* ( formal ) to speak severely to sb because they have done sth wrong 指责；批评 +
=> 来自 re-,向后，往回，buschier, 击，打，来自 busche,灌木，木条，词源同 bush.

- 所有这些都让特朗普走上了一条道路, 会在11月时对其总统任期进行彻底谴责。每过一天，如果没有纠正路线，他失败的可能性就会增加。

== America’s 2020 election

Donald Trump faces a much bigger task than he did in 2016

The polls, political fundamentals and key voters have all turned against the president

Jul 2nd 2020 |


DONALD TRUMP’S path to re-election has never looked more difficult. In early June his deficit in the polls against Joe Biden was “just” six percentage points. That may seem large, but it is close enough for the president to conceivably gain the ground required to win an electoral-college victory, even with a minority of the popular vote. He needs to hold Mr Biden to a two- to three-point margin to do so. But nationwide protests, the growing reality of the country’s economic turmoil and a rapidly spreading rebound of covid-19 cases have pushed him even farther behind.

Today he faces a nine-point uphill climb nationally and is behind by between four and eight points in the bellwether states. The president even acknowledged his dire situation in an interview with Fox News last week, saying “Joe Biden is gonna be your president because some people don’t love me, maybe.” According to The Economist’s election-forecasting model, Mr Trump has a one-in-nine chance of winning a second term—down from a one-in-five shot last month.

The president is struggling for at least three reasons. First, he has always relied on defacing his opponents. In 2016 he succeeded in making Hillary Clinton unacceptable to a slightly bigger share of the electorate than the minority that actually liked him. His job was made easier by her low favourability ratings. According to a poll conducted by YouGov on the eve of the election, Mr Trump was rated favourably by 39% of American adults, compared with Mrs Clinton’s 41%; the shares who viewed them unfavourably were 60% and 57%, respectively. Of course, Mr Trump did not have to convince a majority of all American voters that he was preferable to the former secretary of state: his victory depended on persuading a majority of mostly white voters in the Midwest to opt for him.

Mr Trump’s strategy worked (if losing the popular vote by 3m ballots can be counted as working) last time round, when his opponent was already extremely unpopular. But from the start it looked a dicey bet against Mr Biden, who is far more popular than Mrs Clinton was. According to YouGov’s interviews of 1,500 Americans between June 21st and June 23rd, 43% of adults view the former vice-president favourably and only slightly more (47%) dislike him. Mr Trump’s ratings are much harsher: 42% like him and 53% do not. The president’s handling of the pandemic, in particular, makes it hard to imagine he has much room for improvement here.

Second, Mr Trump is being dragged down by the dramatic movement of older voters, horrified by the now-exploding spread of covid-19, away from him. Overall, Mr Biden’s vote margin has increased by about five points over Mrs Clinton’s final performance in 2016 among people who voted last time round, according to an analysis of YouGov’s data. Voters over 65 have led the charge; their vote margin for Mr Biden is six points better than Mrs Clinton’s was, whereas that of voters under 30 has not budged at all. White voters have also fled Mr Trump’s ranks in much larger numbers than voters of colour. Mr Biden is seven points ahead of Mrs Clinton’s position among whites, while Hispanics have moved six points towards Trump (though they still overwhelmingly oppose him).

Third and most important, the president has lost ground with non-college white voters. This group was Mr Trump’s seawall in 2016; it prevented a tide of national ballots from breaching his electoral-college victory. But this time these voters have moved eight points towards his opponent. In swing states their shift is a more modest six percentage points; but in those close contests, such a change, if it sticks, would imperil Mr Trump. He has also lost ground among Christians—both of the evangelical and mainline varieties.

It is unclear why white voters without a college degree have been the most likely to leave Mr Trump’s camp. Some clues may be found in this year’s Democratic presidential primary elections, in which non-college whites were also the most likely to leave Bernie Sanders’s wing of the party. It is likely that Mr Biden represents a more appealing candidacy to these voters than Mrs Clinton did. Social scientists have found that these voters tend to be more racially conservative and harbour more hostile views about feminism than others do. Mr Biden’s candidacy has focused less on the politics of diversity and empowerment than Mrs Clinton’s before him.

Whatever the reason, Mr Trump has lost most support among his stalwart backers from 2016. That may mean, when it comes down to it, that they are likelier than many now imagine to swing back to him on voting day. Perhaps they will. But according to YouGov’s data, the president’s defectors are more likely than others to have voted in the Democratic primaries this year—a sign that many may have been Democrats who did not like Mrs Clinton. They are also 14 percentage points more likely than other voters to believe that race relations have grown worse during Mr Trump’s tenure, and a whopping 22 points likelier to disapprove of how he has handled the coronavirus. Even worse for Mr Trump, they are 30% more likely than other voters to say their personal finances have deteriorated over the past year.

So on all the issues most important to voters at the moment, these voters rate Mr Trump poorly. Though they could move back to him, at present their defection has pushed Mr Trump to clear underdog status. It has also raised a distinct possibility that he could lose by a landslide.

Mr Trump’s allies have raised the possibility that he could win round enough undecided voters to muster an electoral-college victory again. Such voters are a natural crutch for the campaign: wishy-washy voters who last time held their breath until the “October surprise” from James Comey, the FBI director who announced a resumption of the investigation into Mrs Clinton’s emails, perhaps came to Mr Trump’s rescue. But the president’s campaign faces even more bad news on this front.

Never tell me the odds

According to YouGov’s polling, this year’s undecided voters are more likely to be young, non-white and college-educated (all factors that correlate with voting for Democrats). Few are conservatives; 64% voted in this year’s Democratic primary elections. Of those with an opinion about the president, 63% disapprove of his time in office, and they are more likely to oppose him on race relations, covid-19 and the economy than they are to support him.

This puts Mr Trump in a serious bind. For each undecided voter he could win to his cause, he would probably cause two others to vote against him. The same is true for non-voters. According to YouGov’s data, voting-eligible Americans who did not cast ballots in 2016 oppose the president by 20 percentage points.

Many political pundits were stunned by Mr Trump’s upset victory in 2016. Mr Comey himself confessed to being so sure of the outcome of the contest that he took unprecedented steps against one candidate (which may have ended up costing her the election). But the statistical model The Economist built to predict presidential elections would not have been so shocked. Run retroactively on the last cycle, it would have given Mr Trump a 27% chance of winning the contest on election day. In July of 2016 it would have given him a 30% shot.

This time our model points with much greater confidence to a defeat for Mr Trump. Today, it gives him just an 11% chance of winning re-election in November. It is not impossible that he could pull it off. Fans of poker will know that closing an inside straight (which happens in 9% of hands) happens frequently enough to take seriously. It should be taken especially seriously when the leadership of the free world is at stake.

But is Mr Trump capable of doing what is needed to win? He would have to take the country’s ever-worsening outbreak of covid-19 seriously, change his tone and actions on racial justice and pursue economic policies that reverse the coronavirus-induced depression (renewed growth would certainly be a boon to his prospects). And then he would have to perform the nearly impossible task of making himself appear more moderate and likeable than his opponent. Mr Biden is routinely achieving 50% support in opinion polls, far higher than Mrs Clinton or Barack Obama managed in 2016 or 2012.

All this puts Mr Trump on a path to a resounding rebuke of his presidency in November. Every day that passes without a course-correction increases the likelihood of his defeat.
