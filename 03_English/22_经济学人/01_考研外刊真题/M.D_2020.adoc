A group of labour(`=work, especially physical work 劳动；（尤指）体力劳动`) MPs(`=议员 Member of Parliament`), among them Yvette Cooper, *are bringing* in the new year *with* a call *to institute*(`=to introduce a system, policy, etc. or start a process 建立，制定（体系、政策等）；开始；实行`) a UK "town of culture" award(`=a prize such as money, etc. for sth that sb has done 奖；奖品；奖金；奖状`).

The proposal(`=a formal suggestion or plan; the act of making a suggestion 提议；建议；动议`) *is that* it should *sit alongside* the existing city of culture title, which *was held(`=to own or have sth 拥有；持有 / to have sth you have gained or achieved 获得；赢得`) by* Hull in 2017 and *has been awarded to* Coventry for Zozl.

包括伊薇特•库珀(Yvette Cooper)在内的一群工党议员, 在迎接新年之际，呼吁设立一个英国“文化之城”奖。该项目的提议是，它应该与现有的文化之城称号(city of culture title)放在一起。该称号由赫尔(Hull)于2017年获得，并已授予考文垂(Coventry)Zozl。

====
- hold +
-> Employees *hold(`=to own or have sth 拥有；持有`) 30% of the shares*. 雇员持有30%的股份。 +
-> She *held(`=to have sth you have gained or achieved 获得；赢得`) the title of world champion* for three years. 她保持了三年的世界冠军头衔。
====

Cooper and her colleagues *argue that* the success of the crown 王冠 for Hull, where it *brought in* €220m of investment and an avalanche(`=a mass of snow, ice and rock that falls down the side of a mountain 雪崩；山崩`) of arts, out *not to be confined(a.)(`=If something is confined to a particular place, it exists only in that place. If it is confined to a particular group, only members of that group have it. 只限于 (某地、某团体) 的`) to* cities.

====
- avalanche => avaler, 向下，同valance, 挂布。-anche, 同后缀ance.
====
库珀和她的同事们认为，赫尔皇冠的成功并不局限于城市，它为赫尔带来了2.2亿英镑的投资和大量艺术作品。

Britain' town, it is true *are not prevented from* applying （通常以书面形式）申请, but they *generally lack the resources* to put together a bit *to beat*(`=to defeat sb in a game or competition （在比赛或竞争中）赢，打败（某人）`) their bigger competitions.

A town of culture award *could*, it is argued, *become* an annual event, *attracting funding* and *creating jobs*.

英国的小镇确实没有被阻止申请，但他们通常缺乏资源来一点点地击败他们更大的竞争对手。有人认为，文化小镇奖可以成为一年一度的活动，吸引资金并创造就业机会。

Some *might see* the proposal *as* a boo by prize *for the fact that* Britain *is no longer be able to apply for* the much more prestigious(a.)(`=respected and admired as very important or of very high quality 有威望的；声誉高的`) title of European capital of culture, a sought-after(a.)(`=Something that is sought-after is in great demand, usually because it is rare or of very good quality. 受青睐的，很吃香的`) award *bagged(`=to put sth into bags 把…装进袋子`) by* Glasgow 英国城市名 in 1990 and Livorpool in 2008.

====
- prestige => 来自prae,在前面，stringere,拉，拉绳子，捆绑，词源同string.该词原用于形容法国皇帝拿破仑像个街头玩变戏法的，含贬义和讽刺意味，后随着越来越多的人崇拜拿破仑，词义由贬义转褒义，而原词义则不再使用。
====
有些人可能会把这个提议看作是一个嘘声，因为英国已经不能再申请更有声望的欧洲文化之都的称号了，这是1990年格拉斯哥和2008年利沃浦分别获得的一个广受欢迎的奖项。

"A cynic(`=a person who does not believe that sth good will happen or that sth is important 悲观者；怀疑者 /a person who believes that people only do things to help themselves, rather than for good or sincere reasons 认为人皆自私的人；愤世嫉俗者`) *might speculate that* the UK is on the verge of(`=*on/to the verge of sth/of doing sth* : very near to the moment when sb does sth or sth happens 濒于；接近于；行将`) *disappearing into* an endless fever(n.)(`=a state of nervous excitement 激动不安；兴奋紧张`) of self-celebration  庆祝；颂扬 in its desperation(`=the state of being desperate 绝望；拼命；铤而走险`) *to reinvent(`=~ sth/yourself (as sth) : to present yourself/sth in a new form or with a new image 以新形象示人；以新形式出现`) itself* for the post-Brexit world: after town of culture, who knows {that will follow} -- village of culture? Suburb of culture? Hamlet(`=大写开头 Hamleta 哈姆雷特 / 小写开头 hamlet : very small village 小村庄`) of culture?

====
- desperate => 来自despair, 绝望。de-离开,分离 -sper-希望 + -ate形容词词尾
- reinvent => re-,再，重新，invent,发明，创造。比喻用法。
====

“一个悲观的怀疑论者可能会猜测，英国正处于无尽的自我庆祝热潮的边缘，不顾一切地为英国, 在退欧后的世界中, 重塑自己：在文化小镇之后，谁知道这会是什么-文化村？文化郊区？文化的哈姆雷特？


It is also wise *to recall(`=to remember sth 记起；回忆起；回想起`) that* such titles are not a cure-all(`=something that people believe can cure any problem or any disease 万灵药；灵丹妙药`).

A badly run "year of culture" *washes(`=(of water 水) to flow or carry sth/sb in a particular direction （向着某一方向）流动；冲向`) in and out of a place* like the tide 潮；潮汐, *bringing* prominence(n.)(`=the state of being important, well known or noticeable 重要；突出；卓越；出名`) *for a spell*(`=a short period of time during which sth lasts （持续的）一段时间`) but *leaving* no lasting benefits *to* the community.

我们还应该清醒地认识到，这些"文化"头衔, 对脱欧后的英国并不是包治百病的灵丹妙药。一个糟糕的“文化年”的影响, 就像潮水一样在一个地方进进出出，带来了一段时间的知名度，但没有任何持久的益处, 留下给社区。
====
- spell : n.  a short period of time during which sth lasts （持续的）一段时间 +
-> There will be rain at first, with *sunny spells*(n.) later. 开始会有雨，雨后间晴。 +
-> She went to the doctor complaining of *dizzy spells* . 她去找医生看病，说自己一阵一阵地头昏。 +
-> *I spent a brief spell* on the Washington Post. 我曾在《华盛顿邮报》工作过一小段时间。
====


The really successful holders of such titles *are* those that *do a great deal* more than *fill* hotel bedrooms and *bring in*(`=*BRING SB/STH IN* : to attract sb/sth to a place or business 吸引；引入`) high-profile(`=receiving or involving a lot of attention and discussion on television, in newspapers, etc. 经常出镜（或见报）的；高姿态的`) arts events and good press for a year.

They *transform*(`=to completely change the appearance or character of sth, especially so that it is better 使改变外观（或性质）；使改观`) the aspirations of the people who live there; they *nudge*(`=to push sb/sth gently or gradually in a particular direction （朝某方向）轻推，渐渐推动; / （用肘）轻推，轻触`) the self-image(`=the opinion or idea you have of yourself, especially of your appearance or abilities 自我形象；自我印象`) of the city *into* a bolder(`=bold : brave and confident; not afraid to say what you feel or to take risks 大胆自信的；敢于表白情感的；敢于冒险的`) and more optimistic(`=expecting good things to happen or sth to be successful; showing this feeling 乐观的；抱乐观看法的`) light.

"文化"头衔真正成功的持有者，是那些除了给酒店卧室带来充足的旅客人流, 及引进引人注目的艺术活动, 和一年的良好报道之外，还做了其他很多事情的人。这些人, 才改变了当地居民的愿望; 他们将这些"文化"头衔的城市的自我印象, 推向了更自信、更乐观的一面。
====
- transform : v. +
-> The photochemical reactions *transform*(`=to change the form of sth 使改变形态`) the light *into* electrical impulses. 光化学反应使光变为电脉冲。 +
-> It was an event *that would transform(`=to completely change the appearance or character of sth, especially so that it is better 使改变外观（或性质）；使改观`) my life*. 那是能够彻底改变我一生的一件事。

- nudge => 词源不详。 nudie 裸体照片，裸体表演 来自nudist的口语。
====


It is hard *to get* right, and *requires* a remarkable degree of vision(`=the ability to think about or plan the future with great imagination and intelligence 想象力；眼力；远见卓识`), as well as cooperation between city authorities, the private sector, community groups and cultural organisations.

But it can be done: Glasgow's 英国城市名 year as European capital of culture *can certainly be seen as* one of complex series of factors that *have turned* the city *into* the power of art, music and theatre that it *remains* today.

A "town of culture" *could be not just about* the arts *but about* honouring(v.)(`= *honour sb (with sth)* : to do sth that shows great respect for sb/sth 尊敬，尊重（某人）`) a town's peculiarities(`=peculiarity : a feature that only belongs to one particular person, thing, place, etc. （人、物、地等的）个性，特色，特点`) -- *helping* sustain(v.) its high street(`=*high street* : ( BrE ) ( NAmE *main street* ) the main street of a town, where most shops/stores, banks, etc. are 大街（城镇的主要商业街道）`), *supporting* local facilities and [above all] *celebrating*(`= to praise sb/sth 赞美；颂扬；歌颂`) its people and *turn it into action*.

这很难做到正确，它需要高度的远见卓识，以及城市当局、私营部门、社区团体和文化组织之间的共同合作。但这是可以做到的: 格拉斯哥作为欧洲文化之都的一年，可以被看作是一系列复杂的因素之一，这些因素, 将力量, 带给了这座城市的艺术、音乐和戏剧中，一直保持到今天。
一个“文化之城”不仅仅是只关注艺术方面，还要尊重一个城市自身已经存在的特色 —— 帮助维持它的商业街，支持当地的设施，最重要的是赞美它的人民，并将这些价值观, 转变为实际的行动。

Scientific publishing has long been a licence to print money, Scientists need journals in which to publish their research, so they will supply the articles without monetary reward. Other scientists perform the specialised work of peer review also for free, because it is a central element in the acquisition of status and the production of scientific knowledge.

With the content of papers secured for free, the publisher needs only find a market for its journal. Until this century, university libraries were not very price sensitive. Scientific publishers routinely report profit margins approaching 40% on their operations, at a time when the rest of the publishing industry is in an existential crisis.

The Dutch giant Elsevier, which claims to publish 25% of the scientific papers produced in the world, made profits of more than f 900m last year, while UK universities alone spent more than f 210m in 2016 to enable researchers to access their own publicly funded research;both figures seem to rise unstoppably despite increasingly desperate efforts to change them.The most drastic, and thoroughly illegal, reaction has been the emergence of Sci-Hub, a kind of global photocopier for scientific papers, set up in 2012, which now claims to offer access to every pay walled article published since 2015. The success of Sci-Hub, which relies on researchers passing on copies they have themselves legally accessed, shows the legal ecosystem has lost legitimacy among its users and must be transformed so that it works for all participants.

In Britain the move towards open access publishing has been driven by funding bodies.In some ways it has been very successful. More than half of all British scientific research is now published under open access terms; either freely available from the moment of publication,or pay walled for a year or more so that the publishers can make a profit before being placed on general release.

Yet the new system has not worked out any cheaper for the universities. Publishers have responded to the demand that they make their product free to readers by charging their writers fees to cover the costs of preparing an article. These range from around500 to $5,000.A report last year pointed out that the costs both of subscriptions and of these "article preparation costs" had been steadily rising at a rate above inflation.

In some ways the scientific publishing model resembles the economy of the social internet:labour is provided free in exchange for the hope of status, while huge profits are made by a few big firms who run the market places. In both cases, we need a rebalancing of power.

Progressives often support diversity mandates as a path to equality and a way to level the playing field. But all too often such policies are an insincere form of virtue-signaling that benefits only the most privileged and does little to help average people.

A pair of bills sponsored by Massachusetts state Senator Jason Lewis and House Speaker Pro Tempore Patricia Haddad, to ensure "gender parity" on boards and commissions, provide a case in point.

Haddad and Lewis are concerned that more than half the state-government board are lessthan40 percent female. In order to ensure that elite women have more such opportunities, they have proposed imposing government quotas. If the bills become law, state boards and commissions will be required to set aside 50 percent of board seats for women by 2022.

The bills are similar to a measure recently adopted in Califomia, which last year became the first state to require gender quotas for private companies. In signing the measure, California Governor Jerry Brown admitted that the law, which expressly classifies people on the basis of sex, is probably unconstitutional.

The US Supreme Court frowns on sex based classifications unless they are designed to address an "important" policy interest, Because the California law applies to all boards, even where there is no history of prior discrimination, courts are likely to rule that the law violates the constitutional guarantee of "equal protection".

But are such government mandates even necessary? Female participation on corporate boards may not currently mirror the percentage of women in the general population, but so what?

The number of women on corporate boards has been steadily increasing without government interference. According to a study by Catalyst, between 2010 and 2015 the share of women on the boards of global corporations increased by 54 percent.

Requiring companies to make gender the primary qualification for board membership will inevitably lead to less experienced private sector boards. That is exactly what happened when Norway adopted a nationwide corporate gender quota.

Writing in The New Republic, Alice Lee notes that increasing the number of opportunities for board membership without increasing the pool of qualified women to serve on such boards has led to a "golden skirt "phenomenon, where the same elite women scoop up multiple seats on a variety of boards.

Next time somebody pushes corporate quotas as a way to promote gender equity,remember that such policies are largely self-serving measures that make their sponsors feelgood but do little to help average women.

Last Thursday, the French Senate passed a digital services tax, which would impose an entirely new tax on large multinationals that provide digital services to consumers or users in France. Digital services include everything from providing a platform for selling goods and services online to targeting advertising based on user data, and the tax applies to gross revenue from such services. Many French politicians and media outlets have referred to this as a"GAFA tax," meaning that it is designed to apply primarily to companies such as Google,Apple, Facebook and Amazon-in other words, multinational tech companies based in the United States.

The digital services tax now awaits the signature of President Emmanuel Macron, who has expressed support for the measure, and it could go into effect within the next few weeks.But it has already sparked significant controversy, with the Unite Sates trade representative opening an investigation into whether the tax discriminates against American companies,which in turn could lead to trade sanctions against France.

The French tax is not just a unilateral move by one country in need of revenue. Instead,the digital services tax is part of a much larger trend, with countries over the past few years proposing or putting in place an alphabet soup of new international tax provisions. These have included Britain's DPT (diverted profits tax).

Australia's MAAL (multinational antiavoidance, law), and India's SEP (significant economic presence) test, to name but a few. At the same time, the European Union. Spain,Britain and several other countries have all seriously contemplated digital services taxes.

These unilateral developments differ in their specifics, but they are all designed to tax multinationals on income and revenue that countries believe they should have a right to tax,even if international tax rules do not grant them that right. In other words, they all share a view that the international tax system has failed to keep up with the current economy.

In response to these many unilateral measures, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is currently working with 131 countries to reach aconsensus by the end of 2020 on an international solution. Both France and the United States are involved in the organization's work, but France's digital services tax and the American response raise questions about what the future holds for the international tax system.

France's planned tax is a clear warning: Unless a broad consensus can be reached on reforming the international tax system, other nations are likely to follow suit, and American companies will face a cascade of different taxes from dozens of nations that will prove burdensome and costly.
