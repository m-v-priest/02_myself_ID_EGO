## 2017-01.

*First* two hours, *now* three hours — this is how far *in advance* authorities *are recommending* people *show up* 使显露; 显露 *to catch* a domestic flight 航班;飞行, at least at some major U.S. airports (with increasingly massive security 保安措施; 安全措施 lines 人或物的行列).

从开始的两个小时，到现在是三个小时——这是当局建议人们乘坐国内航班需要提前到达机场的时间，至少在一些安检队伍越来越长的主要的美国机场, 是这种情况。

Americans *are* willing *to tolerate* time-consuming security procedures 正常程序，手续，步骤 *in return for* increased safety.
The crash of Egypt Air Flight 班机 804, which terrorists *may have downed* 使倒下；击倒 over the Mediterranean Sea, *provides* another tragic reminder of why.

====
- down : v. *to force sb/sth down to the ground* 使倒下；击倒 +
-> to down a plane 击落一架飞机
====

美国人愿意忍受费时的安检程序以换取更多安全。埃及航空公司804航班疑遭恐怖分子袭击而坠毁于地中海,这一悲剧再一次提醒着人们为何支持安检。

But 主{*demanding* too much of air travelers旅行者；旅客 or *providing* too little security} 谓 [in return 作为报答] *undermines*(`=to make sth gradually weaker or less effective`) public support for the process.
And *it should*: Wasted time *is* a drag on Americans' economic and private lives, *not to mention* 提到；说到 infuriating(a.)(`=annoys you very much`).

====
- undermine : V-T If you undermine something such as a feeling or a system, you *make it less strong or less secure than it was before*, often by a gradual process or by repeated efforts. 逐渐削弱; 逐渐动摇  +
*to make sth, especially sb's confidence or authority, gradually weaker or less effective* 逐渐削弱信心、权威等；使逐步减少效力 +
=> *under-,在下面，mine,挖矿，挖坑。* 比喻义削弱根基，削弱。 +
-> This crisis *has undermined his position*. 这场危机已损害了他的地位。

- *not to mention* : *used to introduce extra information* and emphasize what you are saying 更不用说；且不说 +
-> He has two big houses in this country, *not to mention* his villa in France. 他在这个国家有两座大房子，*更别提*他在法国的别墅了。
====

但是对航空旅客要求太多,或向他们提供的相应安全保障太少,都会削弱旅客对这一程序的支持。而这是理所应当的:浪费的时间拖累美国人民的经济生活和私人生活,更不必说还令人愤怒。

Last year, the Transportation 运输;交通工具 Security Administration (TSA) *found* in a secret check *that* undercover 秘密工作的；暗中做的；私下进行的 investigators *were able to sneak(v.)偷偷地做；偷带 weapons* — *both* fake *and* real — *past* airport security 机场安检 nearly every time they tried.

主{*Enhanced* security measures [since then], *combined with* a rise (in airline travel) 原因状 *due to* the improving economy *and* low oil prices}, 谓 *have resulted in* long waits [at major airports *such as* Chicago's O'Hare International 芝加哥奥黑尔国际机场].

*It* is not yet clear {*how much* more effective airline security *has become*} — but the lines are obvious.

去年,美国运输安全管理局(TSA)在一次秘密调查中发现,卧底调查员能够偷偷携带武器(不管真假)成功通过机场安检,几乎屡试不爽。
自那以后,安全措施有所加强,加上选择航空旅行的人数也因经济好转和低油价而有所增加,导致旅客在芝加哥奥黑尔国际机场等主要机场等候时间过长。航空安检的有效性提升了多少尚不清楚,但候机队伍(长)是显而易见的。


Part of the issue is that 表从 the government *did not anticipate* 预料(到)；预期 the steep 陡峭的; 突然的；急剧的 increase (in airline travel), so the TSA is now rushing *to get* new screeners 筛选人 on the line.

Part of the issue is that 表从 airports *have* only so much room *for* screening 筛查 lanes 安检通道.

Another factor *may be* that 表从 more people are trying *to overpack* their carry-on 随身携带的 bags *to avoid* checked-baggage 行李托运 fees, though 虽然；尽管 the airlines *strongly dispute*(`=to question whether sth is true and valid`) this.

====
- screening : n. *the testing or examining of a large number of people or things* for disease, faults, etc. 筛查 +
-> breast cancer *screening* 乳腺癌筛查

- lane : N-COUNT A lane is *a narrow road*, especially in the country. (尤指乡间的) 小路 +
-> 来自Proto-Germanic lano,小巷，通道，来自PIE*le,走，移动，*词源可能同lead*. +

- check : [ VN ] ( NAmE ) *to leave coats, bags, etc. in an official place (called a checkroom )* while you are visiting a club, restaurant, etc. *存放；寄放* +
-> Do you want *to check your coats*? 你们要寄放外套吗？

- dispute : v. to question whether sth is true and valid *对…提出质询；对…表示异议（或怀疑）* +
=> dis-分离 + -put-考虑 + -e动词词尾 → 各人想法不一样,各抒己见, 即不同的思考，引申词义争论。 +
-> These figures *have been disputed*. 有人对这些数字提出了质疑。
====

部分问题在于, 政府没有预计到航空旅客人数激增的情况, 因此运输安全管理局正仓促招募新的安检员。部分问题在于, 机场只有有限的空间用作安检通道。另一原因可能是, 更多旅客试图多带随身行李,以免去托运行李的费用,不过航空公司均强烈抵制这一做法。


There is one step (the TSA *could take*) (that would not require(v.) *remodeling重建; 改造 airports* or *rushing to hire*): *Enroll* 使加入；注册；登记 more people in the PreCheck program.

PreCheck *is supposed to* be a win-win *for* travelers and the TSA. Passengers (who *pass* a background check) *are* eligible 有资格的；合格的 *to use* expedited 加快 screening lanes. This *allows* the TSA *to focus on* travelers who *are* higher risk, *saving time for* everyone involved. The TSA wants to *enroll* 25 million people in PreCheck.

====
- expedite : V-T If you expedite something, *you cause it to be done more quickly*. 加快 +
=> *ex-, 向外。-ped, 脚，脚镣*，词源同foot, impede. 即解脱脚镣的束缚，加快速度，或来自比喻义，解脱脚的束缚，飞起来。 +
->  We tried to help you *expedite your plans*.  我们试图帮你加快你的计划。
====

TSA可以采取一项措施,而无需改造机场或急聘员工:将更多人纳入预检计划。预检本该是对旅客和TSA 都有利的办法。通过了背景调查的乘客, 有资格使用快速安检通道。这能让管理局集中精力检查“高危”旅客,为所有相关人员节省时间。TSA 欲将2500万人纳入预检计划。


It *has not gotten* [anywhere] *close to* that, and one big reason *is* sticker 贴纸 shock 价位震撼 : Passengers *must pay* $85 every five years *to process* their background checks. Since the beginning, this price tag *has been* PreCheck’s fatal(a.)致命的,后果严重的 flaw.

====
- *sticker shock* : 价格震惊（发现价格比想象的要高得多）
====

Upcoming reforms *might bring* the price *to* a more reasonable level. But Congress *should look into* 仔细调查(事实、情况) *doing so directly*, by *helping* ① *to finance* 提供资金 PreCheck enrollment 登记；入伍 or ② *to cut costs* in other ways.

====
- look into : PHRASAL VERB If a person or organization *is looking into* a possible course of action, a problem, or a situation, *they are finding out about it and examining the facts relating to it*. 调查

- *look into后常接名词,表示“仔细调查(事实、情况)”之意,文中接动名词结构doing sth,可理解为“考虑这么做”。*

- Upcoming、might暗示现在仍处于纸上谈兵的阶段, 下面作者建议国会不能再坐等改革起效,而应该考虑立刻采取直接有效的行动, 即 doing so directly.
====

实际人数远未达到这一目标,一大原因在于标价冲击波(背景调查的费用过高)。乘客每五年须缴纳85美元才能进行背景调查。从一开始,这个标价(费用过高)就一直是预检项目的致命弱点。
即将进行的改革可能会使价格降至更合理的水平。但是国会应该考虑直接降低价格,这可以通过向预检注册提供资金或削减其他方面的开支来实现。

The TSA cannot continue *diverting 使转向；使绕道；转移 resources into* underused 未充分使用的 PreCheck lanes [while most of the traveling public *suffers* in unnecessary lines]. *It is long past time* to make the program *work*.
====
-  *It is past time that ... 早该..., 也可以写成 It is long past time that..., it is well past time that...*
====

大多数旅客在不必要的排队中受苦之际,TSA不该继续将资源投入未充分利用的预检通道。早就该让预检计划发挥作用。

## 2017-02.

“The ancient Hawaiians *were* astronomers,” *wrote* Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii's last reigning(冠军)本届的; 现任的 monarch 君主；帝王, in 1897. Star watchers *were* among the most esteemed(`=greatly admire and respect`) members of Hawaiian society. Sadly, all *is* not well with astronomy in Hawaii today. Protests 公开反对；抗议 *have erupted* over construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), a giant observatory 天文台；天文观测站；气象台 that *promises*(`=to make sth seem likely to happen; to show signs of sth`) *to revolutionize*(`=to completely change the way that sth is done`) humanity's view of the cosmos 宇宙.

====
- promise : v. *to make sth seem likely to happen*; *to show signs of sth* 使很可能；预示 +
-> *It promises to be* an exciting few days. 那可望是兴奋刺激的几天。
====

“古夏威夷人都是天文学家，夏威夷最后一位统治君主——利留卡拉尼女王在1897年写道。观星人曾经是夏威夷社会中最受人敬重的群体。但可悲的是，夏威夷如今的天文学却发展地不那么好。三十米望远镜简称TMT是一座巨型天文观测台，它有望彻底改变人类对宇宙的认知，它的修建遭到了人们的抗议。


At issue *is* the TMT's planned location on Mauna Kea, a dormant休眠的 volcano (*worshiped 崇拜，敬仰 by* some Hawaiians *as* the piko 脐带；相互连接的地方), that *connects* the Hawaiian Islands *to* the heavens.

But Mauna Kea 莫纳克亚山夏威夷岛的死火山 *is* also home *to* some of the world's most powerful telescopes. *Rested in* the Pacific Ocean, Mauna Kea's peak *rises above* the bulk(`=the main part of sth; most of sth`) of our planet's dense atmosphere, where conditions *allow* telescopes *to obtain* images of unsurpassed(`=better or greater than any other`) clarity(n.)画面、物质或声音的清晰，清楚，清澈.

====
- bulk : n. (1) the ~ (of sth) : *the main part of sth*; most of sth 主体；大部分 / (2) *the weight or shape of sb/sth large* 巨大的体重或重量、形状、身体等 +
=> 词源*同ball, 膨胀，鼓起，球*。 +
-> *The bulk of the population* lives in cities. 大多数人口居住在城市里。
====

有争议的是TMT的计划建造地点——莫纳克亚山，它是被一些夏威夷人信奉为“piko”夏威夷本地语言中代表着“大海的浪花”，“冲浪运动”，并引申有“阳光”，“生命”，“健康”等含义的休眠火山，他们认为此山连接着夏威夷群岛和天堂。
但是莫纳克亚山也是世界上一些功能最强大的天文望远镜的集中地。莫纳克亚山坐落于太平洋，其顶峰穿透地球浓密的大气层。在那里，天文望远镜可以捕捉到无比清晰的画面。


*Opposition(`=the act of strongly disagreeing with sb/sth, especially with the aim of preventing sth from happening`) to* telescopes on Mauna Kea *is* nothing new. A small but vocal(`=telling people your opinions /or protesting about sth loudly and with confidence`) group of Hawaiians and environmentalists 环保主义者 *have long viewed* their presence 存在；出现 *as* ① *disrespect(n.)(`=a lack of respect for sb/sth`) for* sacred(`=considered to be holy`) land and ② a painful reminder of the occupation 侵占；占领 of what *was* once a sovereign 具有独立主权的 nation.

====
- sovereign : ADJ A sovereign state or country *is independent and not under the authority of any other country*. 具有独立主权的 +
-> 来源于拉丁语介词super(上,超过)在古法语中派生的souverein(统治者);词尾的变化是受了英语reign(君主统治)的影响。 词根词缀： *sover(super-)上,超过 + reign(-regn-)统治*
====

反对在莫纳克亚山建造天文望远镜已经不是什么新鲜事了。长久以来，少数夏威夷人和环保主义者, 把那些天文望远镜看作是对那片神圣土地的亵渎，并且会使人们想起这个曾经的主权国家,被占领的惨痛回忆。

Some blame(n.) for the current controversy(`=public discussion and argument`) *belongs to* astronomers. In their eagerness 渴望；热心 *to build* bigger telescopes, they *forgot* that {science *is not* the only way of *understanding* the world}.

They *did not* always *prioritize*(v.)(`=to put tasks, problems, etc. in order of importance`) ① the protection of Mauna Kea's fragile(`=easily broken or damaged`) ecosystems 生态系统 or ② its holiness(n.) 神圣; 圣洁 to the islands' inhabitants 居民.
Hawaiian culture *is not* a relic 遗物; 遗迹 of the past; it *is* a living culture (*undergoing*(`=to experience sth, especially a change or sth unpleasant`) a renaissance(n.) 复兴 today).

====
- prioritize : V-T If you prioritize the tasks that you have to do, *you decide which are the most important and do them first*. 确定 (任务) 优先顺序  +
-> -pri-首要 + -or形容词词尾,较…的 + -ity名词后缀
====

一些人把如今的争议归因于天文学家。他们渴望建造更大的天文望远镜，却忘记了科学不是理解世界的唯一途径。他们并不总是把保护莫纳克亚山脆弱的生态环境, 或维护莫纳克亚山对岛上居民而言的神圣地位, 放在优先位置。夏威夷文化并非历史的遗产；实际上，它是正在复兴的、有着生命力的文化。


Yet science *has* a cultural history, too, with *roots* (*going back to* the dawn 黎明 of civilization). `主` The same curiosity 好奇心；求知欲 (*to find* what *lies* beyond the horizon (that first *brought* early Polynesians *to* Hawaii's shores)) `谓` *inspires*(`=to give sb the desire, confidence or enthusiasm to do sth well`) astronomers today *to explore* the heavens.
====
- inspire => in-,进入，使，-spir,呼吸，词源同respire,spirit.即吸入活力，吸收灵感，引申词义启发，鼓舞。
====

然而科学也是有文化史的，其发展史也要追溯到文明之初。起初，探索地平线外的世界的好奇心, 将波利尼西亚人带到了夏威夷海岸，如今同样的好奇心, 也在吸引着天文学家不断探索天空。

Calls (① *to disassemble*(`=to take apart a machine or structure so that it is in separate pieces`) all telescopes on Mauna Kea or ② *to ban* future development there) *ignore* the reality (that astronomy and Hawaiian culture both *seek* *to answer* big questions about ① who we are, ② where we come from and ③ where we are going).

Perhaps that is 表从 why we *explore* the starry(n.)布满星星的;繁星点点的 skies, as if *answering* a primal(a.)(`=relates to the origins of things; very basic`) calling *to know* ① ourselves and ② our true ancestral 祖先的 homes.

呼吁拆除莫纳克亚山上的所有的天文望远镜, 或者未来禁止安装新天文望远镜的人们, 忽视了一个事实：即天文学和夏威夷文化二者, 都在寻求回答关于我们是谁，我们来自哪里，以及我们将向何处去的严肃问题。
可能这就是为什么我们要不断探索星空，就好像回应最初的召唤，了解我们自己以及我们真正的祖籍。

The astronomy community 团体;社区 *is making compromises*(n.)(`=to give up some of your demands after a disagreement with sb, in order to reach an agreement`) to change its use of Mauna Kea. The TMT site was chosen *to minimize* the telescope’s visibility(`=how far or how clearly you can see in particular weather conditions`) around the island and *to avoid* archaeological and environmental impact.

*To limit* the number of telescopes (on Mauna Kea), old ones will *be removed* [at the end of their lifetimes] and their sites *returned to* a natural state.

*There is no reason* why everyone *cannot be* welcomed on Mauna Kea ① *to embrace* their cultural heritage 遗产;指国家或社会长期形成的历史、传统和特色 and ② *to study* the stars.
====
- heritage  :  -herit-继承 + -age
====

天文学界正在做出让步, 来改变其对莫纳克亚山的使用。TMT的选址, 将最大程度缩小天文望远镜在岛上的可见度，来避免对考古及环境产生影响。
为了限制莫纳克亚山上的天文望远镜数量，旧的天文望远镜在寿命终结后会被拆除，其原址也会恢复自然状态。任何人都有理由去欣然接受莫纳克亚山的文化遗址，同时还可以去研究星空。

Robert F. Kennedy once *said* that {a country's GDP *measures* “everything [*except* that 同位 which *makes* life worthwhile].”}
With Britain *voting* to leave the European Union, and GDP already *predicted*(`=to say that sth will happen in the future`) to slow [as a result], *it* is now a timely(a.)(`=happening at exactly the right time`) moment *to assess*(`=you consider them in order to make a judgment about them`) 宾 what he *was referring to* 谈及.

罗伯特·肯尼迪曾说过，一个国家的国内生产总值, 可以衡量“除了让生活有价值外的一切事情”。英国投票决定脱离欧盟，预计会致使国内生产总值下滑，现在正是评价他这句话的最佳时刻。


The question (of GDP and its usefulness) *has annoyed* policymakers [for over half a century]. Many *argue* that {it is a flawed(`=having a flaw ; damaged or spoiled`) concept}. It *measures* things (that *do not matter*(v.)要紧；有重大影响) and *misses* things (that do).
====
- 最后一句的最后, 其实是省略了matter, 完整的是: and misses things (that do matter)
====

国内生产总值的问题及其作用, 已经困扰决策者半个多世纪了。许多人表示，这是一个错误的概念。它衡量的是一些不重要的事情，却忽略了重要的方面。

By most recent measures, the UK’s GDP *has been* the envy 羡慕；忌妒 of the Western world, with record *low unemployment* and *high growth figures*. If everything *was going* so well, then why *did* over 17 million people *vote for* Brexit(n.) 英国退欧, *despite* the warnings about *what it could do* to their country’s economic prospects(`=the possibility that sth will happen`)?

最近数据显示，英国低失业率和高增长数据, 全都突破纪录，其国内生产总值令西方各国羡慕。如果真的是一切都进行地很顺利，那么为什么会有1700多万人非要投票脱欧，完全不顾这一行为对国家经济前景的威胁呢？

`主` A recent annual study of ① countries and ② their ability *to convert* growth *into* well-being(`= general health and happiness`) `谓` *sheds(`=to send light over sth; to let light fall somewhere`) some light on* that question.

Across the 163 countries (*measured*), the UK *is* one of the poorest performers(`=a person or thing that behaves or works in the way mentioned`) (in *ensuring*(`=to make sure that sth happens or is definite`) {that economic growth *is translated into* meaningful improvements for its citizens}).

[*Rather than* 而不是 just *focusing on* GDP], `主` over 40 different sets of criteria(n.)(`=a factor on which you judge or decide something`) (from health, education and civil society engagement 社会参与) `谓` *have been measured*  目的状 *to get* a more rounded 全面的；一应俱全的；完善的 assessment(`=the act of judging or forming an opinion about sb/sth`) of how countries *are performing*.
====
- criteria :N-COUNT A criterion is *a factor on which you judge or decide something*. (判断的) 标准
- *society engagement* 社会参与
====

最近关于国家及其将经济增长转化为民众幸福感的年度研究, 一定程度上表明了这个问题的原因。关于经济增长是否可以真正改善人民生活方面，英国是被衡量的163个国家中表现最差的国家之一。
该研究并不仅仅是关注国内生产总值，为了更全面地衡量一个国家的表现，从健康，教育、民权社会参与等方面, 采用了40多种不同的标准进行衡量。


While(`=although; despite the fact that`) all of these countries *face* their own challenges, there *are* a number of consistent(a.)(`=happening in the same way and continuing for a period of time`) themes(`=the subject or main idea in a talk`).

Yes, there *has been* a budding(a.)(`=beginning to develop or become successful`) economic recovery [since the 2008 global crash], but *in key indicators*(n.)(`=a sign that shows you what sth is like or how a situation is changing`) in areas (*such as* health and education), major economies *have continued to decline*.

Yet *this isn’t the case* with all countries. Some relatively 相对地 poor European countries *have seen* huge improvements *across*(`=in every part of a place`) measures (*including* civil society, income equality and environment).
====
- indicator :  n. a sign that shows you what sth is like or how a situation is changing 指示信号；标志；迹象 +
-> ...vital *economic indicators*, such as inflation, growth and the trade gap.   …重要的经济指标，如通货膨胀，经济增长以及贸易差额。
====

尽管所有国家都面临自身的挑战，但有些问题一直存在。是的，08年全球金融危机爆发以后，经济在不断恢复，但在健康，教育等重要指标领域，主要经济体都在持续下滑。
但并不是所有国家都存在这样的问题，一些相对贫穷的欧洲国家, 在民权社会、收入公平和环境方面, 有着巨大的改善。


This is a lesson (that rich countries *can learn*): When GDP *is* no longer *regarded as* the sole measure of a country’s success, the world *looks* very different.

So {what Kennedy *was referring to*} *was* that {虽然；尽管 *while* GDP *has been* the most common method for *measuring* the economic activity of nations, *as* a measure, it is *no longer* enough}. It *does not include* important factors *such as* environmental quality or education outcomes(`=the result or effect of an action or event`) -- all things (that *contribute to* a person's sense of well-being).


`主` The sharp(`=sudden and rapid`) hit *to* growth(n.)(`=an increase in economic activity`) (*predicted* around the world /and in the UK) `谓` *could lead to* a decline in the everyday services (we *depend on* for our well-being /and for growth).
But 主 policymakers (who *refocus 重新聚焦 efforts(n.) on* 将工作重点重新放在...上 *improving* well-being *rather than* simply *worrying about* GDP figures) `谓` ① *could avoid* the forecasted doom(`=death or destruction; any terrible event that you cannot avoid `) and ② *may even see* progress.

这是富裕国家可以吸取的教训：当国内生产总值不再作为衡量国家是否成功的唯一标准，世界将变得很不一样。
所以，肯尼迪所指的是，尽管国内生产总值已经成为衡量国家经济活动最普遍的方法，但是仅仅是一种方法，还不足够。 因为，它并没有涵盖一些重要的因素，如环境质量, 或者教育成果——要知道，这些因素通常才能给一个人带来幸福感。
全世界以及英国，都预测经济增长会受到重大打击，这一打击可能导致我们维持幸福感和经济增长所依赖的日常服务水平下降。
但是如果决策者重新关注提升幸福感, 而不是仅仅担心国内生产总值的数据，就能够避免可以预见的经济低迷，实现真正的进步。

Yes , there *has been* a budding economic recovery since the 2008 global crash , but in key indicators (in areas such as health and education) , major economies *have continued to decline* .

So, what Kennedy was referring to *was* that {while GDP *has been* the most common method for *measuring* the economic activity of nations , as a measure , it is no longer enough}. It *does not include* important factors *such as* environmental quality or education outcomes -- all things that *contribute to* a person's sense of well-being.

The sharp hit to growth(n.) (*predicted* around the world and in the UK) *could lead to a decline* in the everyday services we *depend on* for our well-being and for growth . But `主` policymakers who *refocus efforts on* improving well-being *rather than* simply worrying about GDP figures `谓` *could avoid* the forecasted doom /and *may even see* progress .

In a rare unanimous(a.)(`=is agreed or shared by everyone`) ruling(n.)裁决；裁定；判决, the US Supreme Court *has overturned* the corruption conviction(`=the act of finding sb guilty of a crime in court; the fact of having been found guilty`) of a former Virginia governor, Robert McDonnell. But *it did so* while *holding its nose 鼻子 at* the ethics(`=moral principles that control or influence a person's behaviour`) of his conduct(`=a person's behaviour in a particular place or in a particular situation`), which *included* 宾 *accepting* gifts *such as* a Rolex watch and a Ferrari Automobile 汽车 *from* a company (*seeking access to* government).
====
- unanimous : ADJ When a group of people are unanimous, *they all agree about something* or all vote for the same thing. 一致同意的 +
=>  *-un-单一 + -anim-呼吸* + -ous形容词词尾 → 同呼吸,共命运

- *hold one's nose* : 捏住鼻子(隔绝不好的气味或是使水不能流入); 压制厌恶的感觉
====

在罕见的一致裁决中，美国最高法院推翻了对前弗吉尼亚州州长罗伯特·麦克唐纳贪污案的定罪。但是最高法院也对其收取礼物的行为嗤之以鼻，这其中包括接受一家试图打通政府部门关系的一家公司馈赠的劳力士手表和法拉利跑车等礼物。


The high court’s decision *said* {the judge (in Mr. McDonnell’s trial 法院的审讯，审理，审判) *failed to tell* a jury that {it must *look only at* his “official acts,” or the former governor’s decisions on “ specific(`=connected with one particular thing only`) ” and “unsettled(a.)(`=that continues without any agreement being reached`)” issues (*related to* his duties)}}.

高等法院的判决认为，主审麦克唐纳案的法官, 并没有告诉陪审团他们只需审查麦克唐纳的“公务行为”，或者是前州长对于自己职责内“具体的”以及“未解决的”问题的决定。

主 Merely *helping* a gift-giver *gain* access to other officials, unless 除非 *done [with* clear intent *to pressure* those officials], 谓 *is not* corruption, the justices *found*.

法官们发现，只是帮助送礼者接触其他官员，除非出于向这些官员明确施压的目的，否则并不构成贪污罪。

The court *did suggest* that {主 *accepting favors* in return for *opening doors* `系` is “ distasteful(=`unpleasant or offensive`)” and “ nasty(`=very bad or unpleasant`).”}

But *under* anti-bribery 反贿赂 laws, proof must *be made of* 由…组成，由…构成 concrete benefits, *such as* approval(n.) of a contract 合同；合约 or regulation(`=an official rule made by a government or some other authority`).  `主` Simply *arranging a meeting*, *making* a phone call, or *hosting an event* `系` *is not* an “official act.”
====
- nasty : ADJ Something that is nasty is *very unpleasant to see, experience, or feel*. 可恶的 (事物);低俗可厌的 (事物) +
=> 词源不详，*可能来自nose,鼻子*，引申义难闻的，厌恶的，下流的。 +
-> *I had a nasty feeling* that he would follow me. 我有一种极糟糕的预感：他会尾随我 +
->  nasty jokes 下流的笑话
====

法院确实表示，为送礼者开路并从中牟利的行为, 是“令人反感的”且“肮脏的”。但是根据《反腐败法》的规定，必须找出具体的获利证据，例如批准某项合同或者法规。否则仅仅安排会面、打个电话、或者举办某次活动, 并不是“官方行为”。

The court’s ruling(n.) *is* 表 legally sound(a.)(`=sensible`) [in *defining* a kind of favoritism(n.)(`= the act of unfairly treating one person better than others because you like them better`) that *is not* criminal(a.)].

Elected(a.) leaders must *be allowed* to help supporters *deal with* bureaucratic 官僚的；官僚主义的 problems *without fear(n.) of* prosecution(`=the process of trying to prove in court that sb is guilty of a crime`) of bribery.

“`主` The basic compact(`=a formal agreement between two or more people 协定；协议`) (*underlying* representative government),” *wrote* Chief Justice John Roberts for the court, “`谓` *assumes* that {public officials *will hear from* their constituents 选民 /and *act on* 起作用,作用于 their concerns}.”

最高法院的裁决, 在法律上, 合理地界定了一种不违法的“偏袒行为”。("最高法院将该事件判决为一种偏袒, 而不是犯罪的行为" 是合法的。) 民选领袖应该被允许帮助其支持者解决繁文缛节问题而不用担心被起诉受贿赂。“构成代议制政府基础的基本契约认定，公职人员要倾听选民心声，要据选民关切之事出谋划策，” 最高法院首席法官约翰·罗伯茨写道。
====
- sound : a. *sensible*; that you can rely on and that will probably give good results 明智的；合理的；正确的；可靠的 +
-> He gave me some *very sound(a.) advice*. 他给了我一些非常合理的忠告。
====

But the ruling *reinforces*(`=to make it stronger or harder`) the need *for* citizens and their elected representatives, *not* the courts, *to ensure* equality 平等；均等 of access to government.

Officials must not be allowed *to play favorites 厚此薄彼；偏宠 in* providing(v.) information or *in* arranging meetings [simply because an individual or group *provides* a campaign donation 捐赠物；捐赠 or a personal gift].

This type of integrity 正直; 诚实 *requires* will-enforced laws *in* government transparency, such as ① records(n.) of official meetings, ② rules(n.) on lobbying 游说, and ③ information about each elected leader’s source of wealth.

尽管如此，该裁决也进一步强化了公民及其所选代表，而非法院，确保公平接近政府的必要性。
政府官员不可以仅仅因为某个人或团体提供了竞选捐助或个人礼物, 就在提供信息或安排接见时, 对其有所偏袒。
(不能仅仅因为某个个人或团体提供了竞选捐款或个人礼物，就允许官员在提供信息或安排会议时偏袒一方。)
这种诚信, 需要建立在对"政府透明度相关法律"的严格执行, 包括官方会议记录、游说规则，以及每位当选领导人的财富来源信息。

Favoritism(n.)偏袒 (in official access) *can fan*(`=to make a feeling stronger`) public perceptions(`=the way you notice things, especially with the senses`) of corruption. But it is not always corruption. Rather(`=（提出不同或相反的观点）相反，反而`) officials *must avoid* double standards, or different types of access for *average people* and *the wealthy* 富人.

If connections *can be bought*, `主` a basic premise(`=something that you suppose is true and that you use as a basis for developing an idea`) of democratic society -- that *all are equal* in treatment by government -- `谓` *is undermined*(v.)(`=to make sth, especially sb's confidence or authority, gradually weaker or less effective`).

Good government *rests on* 信赖 an understanding of the inherent worth of each individual.

The court’s ruling *is* a step forward [in the struggle against *both* corruption *and* official favoritism 偏袒].

官员接见中存在的“偏袒行为”, 会煽动公众的腐败感知。但它并非一定就是腐败。相反，公务人员应该避免“双重标准”，或者说，避免对有钱人和普通人采取不同的接见方式。如果金钱可以买通人脉关系，民主社会的基本前提——人人享有政府平等对待——就遭到了破坏。善政良治有赖于对每个人的内在价值的把握。
最高法院的裁决, 是在与腐败、“公务偏袒”这两者的斗争中所取得的一个进步。
