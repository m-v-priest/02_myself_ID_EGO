"Look, dear," she said, "you must talk to George. He left school three months ago. He
still hasn't got a job, and he isn't trying to find one. All he does is smoke, eat and play

==== C. Shoplifting.

A manager is talking about the prevention of shoplifting.

Well, I manage a small branch of a large supermarket, and we lose a lot of money
through shoplifting. I have to try to prevent it, or else I'll lose all my profits.

A lot of
shoplifting is done by young people, teenagers in groups. They do it for fun. They're not
frightened so we have to make it difficult for them.

Obviously a supermarket can't have
chains or alarms on the goods, so we have store detectives(n.), who walk around like
ordinary shoppers, otherwise they'll be recognized.

[.my1]
====
- shoplifting (n.)冒充顾客在商店行窃（罪） +
=> shop,商店，lift,小偷小摸。
- branch :  树枝 / a local office or shop/store belonging to a large company or organization 分支；分部；分行；分店

- They're not frightened so we have to make it difficult for them.  他们不害怕，所以我们得给他们制造点困难。

- store detective : a person employed by a large shop/store to watch customers and make sure they do not steal goods 商店专抓行窃者的雇员
- detective  侦探；警探
- otherwise they'll be recognized.  否则他们就会被认出来。
====



We have big signs up, saying
'shoplifters will be prosecuted(v.),' but that doesn't help much. We've started putting cash
desks at all the exits, we've found we have to do that, or else the shoplifters will walk
straight out with things. Of course, that worries the ordinary shopper who hasn't found
what he wanted.

We also use closed-circuit television, but that's expensive. In fact, all
good methods of prevention are quite expensive, and naturally, they make our prices
more expensive, but it has to be done, otherwise shoplifting itself will make all the prices
much higher, and the public doesn't want that!

[.my1]
====
- prosecute (v.)~ (sb) (for sth/doing sth) : to officially charge sb with a crime in court 起诉；控告；检举
- cash desk 收款处；收银台

(sound of chairs being moved, excited voices and piano music)  +

Tania: That's better. I can see you now. And I want to congratulate you. Your rehearsal
was very professional. I was impressed by your technique and your feeling for the music. I
remembered myself twenty years ago.  +
Do you think twenty years is a long time? It all
depends. You must look forward to twenty years of practising six hours every day. Twenty
years of traveling uncomfortably. Twenty years of going to bed instead of going to parties.
 +
Do you look forward to this discipline? I didn't know how difficult my life was going to be,
but I wouldn't change it. The important thing is ... I'm still dancing. For me, dancing is living. +
I'm so sorry. I'm talking too much. Would you like to ask me some questions?  +




James: I would. I'm really worried about my career, Miss Matslova. +
Tania: Please call me Tania. What's your name? + +
James: James, Tania. +
Tania: So, James. Why are you worried? +
James: I love dancing but I hate changing in cold dressing rooms. I don't mind practising
every day. In fact, I like it, I enjoy exercising. But *I'm fed up with* going to bed early every
night and refusing invitations to parties. I like travelling ... but not if it's uncomfortable. I'm confused. Do you think I should carry on? +

Tania: It depends what you want, James. Would you rather go on dancing or would you
rather live a normal, ordinary life? +
James: I want to do both. +
Tania: That, my dear James, is impossible. *I'm fed up with* getting up early. I'm tired(a.) of
travelling. I've always hated leaving my family for weeks or months. But ... I'm a dancer
and I look forward to dancing as long as I can. What can I say? If you don't want to be a
professional dancer more than anything else, you'd better change your plans. +

James: Thank you, Miss M ... er, Tania. Your advice was really helpful. I can see now that
`主` just being keen(a.) on dancing `系` isn't enough for a career. +

that isn't enough. It depends what you want. And that applies to all of you. You must make
up your minds.

villages of that part of the country.  +
The houses stood in two long lines on either side of the dusty road which led to the capital. In the square, the paint was *peeling off* the Town Hall, and some small children were running up and down its steps, laughing.  +
