== 快餐的营养问题

_Fast food_ restaurants have made some Americans rich. +
It's been more than 30 years since the first McDonald's opened, and this nation's _eating habits_ have been transformed by fast food. +

Today, we spend over $50,000,000,000 a year on Whopper's 特大的（或硕大的）东西 _Big Macs_ 巨无霸（麦当劳汉堡名） and the Colonel's 上校 _Fried Chicken_ 炸鸡. The key is convenience. _The ignored factor_ is nutrition.

That's something Michael Jacobson cares about. He's written a Fast Food Guide to tell consumers what's under the bun 圆面包;小圆甜蛋糕；小圆甜饼. +

[.my2]
快餐店已经让一些美国人致富了。自从第一家麦当劳开业以来已经超过30年了，这个国家的饮食习惯已经被快餐所改变。如今，我们每年在汉堡包、巨无霸和肯德基炸鸡上花费超过500亿美元。关键在于便利性，而被忽视的因素是营养。这是迈克尔·雅各布森关心的事情。他写了一本快餐指南，告诉消费者汉堡包下面都有什么。

[.my2]
“每个连锁店都有各种各样的汉堡包：单层、双层、三层；在一些餐厅里还有芝士汉堡、培根汉堡、蘑菇汉堡，一般来说，当他们开始给汉堡包加配料时，你会得到更多的脂肪、更多的盐，而营养价值更低的产品。”

[.my2]
“我们实际上对这些肉进行了分析，发现它们的质量都很普通。对于大多数连锁店来说，它们使用的是普通等级的汉堡肉。你在杂货店或者肉店购买的肉可以更瘦一些，或者如果你选择瘦肉碎。如果你想吃红肉并且想在快餐店吃饭，我建议你选择烤牛肉。在我们进行的测试中，所有的烤牛肉都比所有的汉堡肉瘦。”

[.my2]
“麦当劳的麦乐鸡块，可能是最早的鸡块，不是整块鸡肉。而是由碎鸡皮用磷酸钠和盐黏合在一起制成的复合鸡肉。这是一个相对富含脂肪的产品，一个小份的麦乐鸡块含有大约5茶匙的脂肪。而在汉堡王这样的竞争对手那里，比如说，他们做鸡条，使用的是真正的鸡肉。而且脂肪含量要低得多，一个小份鸡条含有约2茶匙的脂肪，部分原因是因为它没有碎鸡皮。”

If you're getting _fried chicken_, you ought to take off the skin, take off the breading 面包屑,拌粉. That's where _most of the fat, most of the sodium_ are.  +
So you can turn kind of _a mediocre 平庸的；普通的；平常的 product_ into really quite a nutritious product."  +

“嗯，鸡肉制品的脂肪含量, 往往比牛肉制品要少，部分原因是因为脂肪留在了表面。如果你吃的是炸鸡，你应该把皮和面包糠都去掉。那才是大部分的脂肪、大部分的钠。所以你可以把一个一般的产品, 变成一个真正富含营养的产品。”
