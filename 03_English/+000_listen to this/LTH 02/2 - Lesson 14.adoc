[.my2]
访者：那你什么时候停止刮胡子的？

[.my2]
拉克夫人：嗯，我必须承认一开始有点令人不安……人们目瞪口呆地看着你，就好像你是碗里的金鱼一样。我曾经觉得很想说。 “没关系，亲爱的，你知道，这并不是什么不寻常的事情。这只是一点额外的头发。这不是另一个头或什么东西。但最终你会习惯别人的指指点点和大笑。几乎不再注意到它了。现在即使是笑话也不会让我心烦意乱。事实上，三十年后，整天坐在这里被人盯着，有点无聊。但仍然总会有中断。然后隔壁的十英尺女人和侏儒进来喝杯茶聊天，很好地打发了时间。

Interviewer: Would you say there were any advantages to having a fifteen-foot long beard.

[.my2]
访者：你觉得留着十五英尺长的胡子有什么好处吗？

James: Don’t get me wrong 不要误解我 . Paul feels free （表示允许）可以随便做某事 to express himself [with me] just as 正如 he would [with his friends]. He accepts me as a kind of friend.

[.my2]
姆斯：别误会我的意思。保罗可以像对待朋友一样自由地向我表达自己的想法。他接受我作为一种朋友。

Finchley: And really the so-called generation gap is a myth 神话;虚构的东西；荒诞的说法；不真实的事 you know. Teenagers aren’t really so different. As a teacher I find them quite traditional in their attitudes.

[.my2]
利：所以你同意我们刚才从保罗那里听到的那种语言……​

James: Now I didn’t say that. Anyway `主` the concepts of 'approval' and 'disapproval' `谓` tend (v.) to over simplify (v.)使简化；使简易 matters. Every generation creates (v.) its …​ its own special language …​ just as it creates its own styles in clothes and music.

[.my2]
姆斯：我没有这么说。无论如何，“批准”和“不批准”的概念往往过于简单化问题。每一代人都会创造自己的……自己的特殊语言……就像他们在服装和音乐上创造自己的风格一样。

Mrs. Brent: It’s just that …​ er …​ the styles and habits of today’s teenagers are so …​ well basically …​ so unacceptable.

[.my2]
伦特夫人：只是……呃……当今青少年的风格和习惯是如此……基本上……如此令人无法接受。

Mrs. Brent: No …​ I mean unacceptable to the rest of society.

James: For example?  +

Finchley: For example …​ you probably wouldn’t think so but the majority have …​ a firm belief in marriage …​ and in the family.

[.my2]
奇利：例如……你可能不会这么认为，但大多数人……对婚姻……和家庭有坚定的信念。

Darley: Those are things I’ve never talked about with my boy.

[.my2]
利：这些是我从未和我儿子谈论过的事情。

Finchley: And one very clear …​ very notable 值得注意的；显著的；重要的 thing is that they’re always looking for opportunities to help others …

[.my2]
奇利：有一点非常明确……非常值得注意的是，他们总是在寻找机会帮助他人……​

Mrs. Brent: Well, Tony doesn’t help much in the house …

[.my2]
伦特夫人：嗯，托尼在家里帮不了什么忙……​

Finchley: …​ to help others that is who really need help. Not just helping with the washing-up （饭后）刷洗餐具;（饭后的）待洗餐具, Mrs. Brent.

How was trade conducted 组织；安排；实施；执行, then, without money to pay for goods? The answer is by bartering 以货易货. Bartering is the process by which trade takes place through the exchange of goods. Money is not used as payment. Instead, one good is traded for another good.

[.my2]
么，在没有钱支付货物的情况下，贸易是如何进行的呢？答案是通过"物物交换"。"易货贸易"是通过货物交换进行贸易的过程。金钱不用作付款。相反，一种商品被交换为另一种商品。

[.my1]
.案例
====
#★ 注意, 这里的 one good is traded for another good.  如果你无精打采地一路读下来 ...is traded for... 就不一定能立刻想到它的含义. 但如果你将 for 重读音,  ... is traded for...  就能立刻明白这句话的意思. 所以, 英语中, 停顿节奏, 和重度某个逻辑词, 很可能是学习英语的关键!#
====

As trade became more common as a result of people’s interdependence (n.)互相依赖 upon one another, it was necessary to develop or invent (v.) a more convenient method of payment. Consequently, a new form of exchange medium 媒介，手段，方法, money, was introduced into society.

[.my2]
由于人们相互依赖，贸易变得更加普遍，因此有必要开发或发明一种更方便的支付方式。因此，一种新形式的交换媒介——货币——被引入社会。

Of course, `主` #the evolution# from a total barter 以物易物 society to one 后定向前推进 that was totally monetized (v.)使货币化 `谓` #did not occur# overnight. In fact, today there are still societies 社会 that are not monetized (v.), although they account for  (数量、比例上) 占 an insignificant 微不足道的，无足轻重的 amount of world trade.

当然，从"完全的易货社会"到"完全货币化的社会"的演变, 并不是一夜之间发生的。事实上，今天仍然有一些社会没有货币化，尽管它们在世界贸易中所占的份额微不足道。在"易货世界"和"货币化世界"之间的过渡时期，两个系统一起运行。

As I stated (v.)陈述；说明；声明 earlier, money has a specific value, but due to certain conditions, `主` #the money# — or currency 通货,货币, as money is referred to 提到；谈及；说起 — #of# some countries `系`  is more valuable than that of other countries.

正如我前面所说，货币具有特定的价值，但由于某些条件，某些国家的货币（或货币）,比其他国家的货币更有价值。

It is difficult to give examples of barter deals because [in most cases] the terms of the contract are not disclosed (v.)揭露，透露. In some cases, we don’t hear about barter transactions （一笔）交易，业务，买卖;办理；处理 simply because they work (v.) so well. If one company has arranged a profitable exchange, it will be very quiet about it so that its competitors will not come in and try to make a better deal.

[.my2]
很难举出易货交易的例子，因为在大多数情况下，合同的条款是不披露的。在某些情况下，我们没有听说过"易货交易"，仅仅是因为它们运作得很好。如果一家公司安排了一笔有利可图的交易，它会非常低调，这样它的竞争对手就不会进来，试图达成更好的交易。

It is unlikely that the world will revert(v.)回复；恢复 to  a totally barter-oriented 以……为方向的，重视……的 existence, but until `主` #the economic disorder# 后定向前推进 that is present in today’s world `谓` #is remedied# (v.)改正；纠正；改进, bartering will probably become increasingly important as an exchange medium.

[.my2]
世界不太可能恢复到完全以"物物交换"为导向的存在，但在纠正当今世界存在的经济混乱之前，"物物交换"作为一种交换媒介, 可能会变得越来越重要。
