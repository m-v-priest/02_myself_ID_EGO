Lesson 11



== 1

Doctor: Well Mr. Thomson. The first and important thing I have to tell you is that ... mm ... there is really nothing seriously wrong with you ... physically 身体上；肉体上 that is. My ... er ... my very thorough 彻底的；完全的；深入的；细致的 re-examination 复查 and the ... the analyst's report show that basically you are very fit 健康的，健壮的. Yes ... very fit.


Mr. Thomson: So ... Why is it doctor that I'm always so nervy 焦虑的；紧张的 ... tense (人) 紧张的; (肌肉) 紧绷的  ... ready to *jump on* (突然或猛烈地)训斥或攻击 anybody — my wife, children, colleagues 同事?

.nervy  和 tense 的区别
chatGpt:


"Nervy" 和 "tense" 都是用来描述人的情绪或状态的词汇，但它们之间有一些区别：

1."Nervy"（紧张的、不安的）： +
"Nervy" 通常指的是一种紧张、焦虑或不安的情绪，但它可能伴随着一种兴奋或不安定感。当你感到紧张但也有一种兴奋或胆量时，可以使用 "nervy" 这个词。 +
例如：_She felt nervy_ before her big presentation 展示会；介绍会；发布会;（戏剧等的）上演，演出, but she knew she could do it.
"Tense"（紧张的、绷紧的）：

2."Tense" 指的是一种紧张、绷紧或焦虑的状态，通常与情绪的紧张有关。这种状态可能是由压力、焦虑、不安或担忧引起的。 +
例如：*The atmosphere in the room was tense* as they waited for the test results.

总之，**"nervy" 通常**表示紧张情绪**伴随着一些兴奋**或不安定感，*而 "tense"* 更侧重于描述一种紧张或绷紧的状态，*通常与焦虑或紧张有关，而不一定伴随着兴奋。**

Mr. Thomson: Well ... yes. I smoke — what ... about forty ... fifty a day I suppose.

Mr. Thomson: Yes ... I see ... But er ... Well ... it won't be the first time. I've tried to give up smoking several times but it's ... it's no good.


Doctor: You see ... fifty a day is overdoing it ... you must admit. You must cut it down 减少；削减 ... at least that. Oh yes. I know that when you're feeling tense /you ... you probably feel that a cigarette relaxes you. But *in the long run* 从长远来看,终究,最后 ... I do advise you to make ... to make a real effort.

You see ... well obviously I could prescribe 给…开（药）；让…采用（疗法）；开（处方） some kind of tranquillizer  安定药；镇静剂 ... but would that help? I'd prefer — and I'm quite sure you'll agree — I'd prefer to see you really back to normal ... not just seemingly so.

It's over ninety years old and it was in a very bad state of repair.

记者：嗯，米勒先生，您在房子上所做的所有工作给我留下了深刻的印象。您从事这方面工作多久了？ +
米勒先生：几年前我第一次对自己动手感兴趣。你看，我的儿子保罗是残疾人。他坐在轮椅上，我只需要对房子进行改造。我付不起工人的钱来做这件事。我必须学会自己做。 +
记者：您有过这样的工作经历吗？你有什么实用技能吗？ +
米勒先生：没有。我从图书馆借了几本书，但没什么帮助。然后我决定去上夜校，这样我就可以学习基本的木工和电工。 +
记者：你对房子做了哪些改造？ +
米勒先生：首先，要帮助保罗做一些实际的事情。你永远不会真正意识到残疾人所面临的问题，直到它影响到你自己的家人。例如，大多数政府大楼都有通往门口的台阶。他们没有规划建筑物以便残疾人可以进出。我们以前住在公寓里，当然完全不合适。想象一下残疾人在您家中会遇到的问题。我们需要一座有宽阔走廊的大房子，以便保罗可以从一个房间到另一个房间。我们没有多少钱，只好买这个。它已有九十多年的历史，而且维修状况非常糟糕。 +
记者：从哪里开始呢？ +
米勒先生：电气。我彻底重新布置了房子的线路，以便保罗能够接触到所有的开关。我不得不降低电灯开关并提高电源点。我继续清理整个房子，这样保罗就可以够到东西并去他想去的地方。 +
记者：你还做了什么？ +
米勒先生：当我为保罗改变一切时，自己动手已经成为一种爱好。我真的很喜欢用手做事。看，我什至安装了烟雾警报器。 +
记者：这样做的目的是什么？ +
米勒先生：我非常担心火灾。你看，保罗动作不快。我安装了它们，这样如果发生火灾我们就能收到足够的警告。我安装了完整的防盗报警系统。这花了几个星期的时间。前门会自动打开，我将在保罗的轮椅上安装一个装置，以便他可以在需要时打开和关闭它。 +
记者：你现在在做什么工作？ +
米勒先生：我刚刚整理完厨房。我的设计是为了让他能够触及一切。现在我正在扩建，以便保罗在一楼有一个大房间可以在那里工作。 +
记者：有1万英镑的奖金。你准备怎么花呢？ +
米勒先生：我要自己创业，为残疾人改造普通房屋。我想我已经成为这方面的专家了。

The first job *I ever had* was as a waitress. I did it the summer before I started at university, when I was eighteen. I was working in a very nice hotel in a small town in Scotland where there are a lot of tourists in the summer so they were *taking on* 聘用 extra staff. I arrived there in the evening and met some of the other girls who were working at the hotel — we all lived in a little house opposite the hotel. Anyway, they were all really friendly and we had dinner together and then sat around chatting and drinking coffee — I didn't get to bed until after one o'clock in the morning.

Of course, I *stayed up* 熬夜 chatting with the other girls that night too, and most of the other nights I was there. I *fell into bed* at night /and *out of it* at seven the next morning, but I loved the job *after a while* 一段时间后, believe it or not, and I even （用以加强比较）甚至更，愈加，还 went back to work there the next year!

我的第一份工作是当服务员。我在上大学前的那个夏天做了这件事，当时我十八岁。我在苏格兰一个小镇的一家非常好的酒店工作，那里夏天有很多游客，所以他们雇用了额外的员工。我晚上到达那里，遇到了在酒店工作的其他一些女孩——我们都住在酒店对面的一栋小房子里。不管怎样，他们都非常友好，我们一起吃了晚饭，然后坐在一起聊天，喝咖啡——我直到凌晨一点才上床睡觉。我必须在早上七点三十分到餐厅工作才能开始供应早餐。好吧，我直到七点十五分才醒来！于是我披上衣服就赶往酒店。我看起来一定很乱，因为领班只是看着我，让我去洗手间收拾一下自己——我太尴尬了！


我了解到的第一件事是，从餐厅到厨房有两扇沉重的平开门——一扇进厨房，一扇出去，这样进来的服务员就不会撞到出去的服务员。不管怎样，那天早上我太害怕服务员领班了，以至于我没有好好听他在说什么，所以当其中一个服务员让我帮他拿两盘鸡蛋和培根和一杯橙汁时出了餐厅，直接走错门，和进来的另一个服务员撞到了！你无法想象那一团糟——鸡蛋、培根和橙汁遍布地板、门、服务员和我。另一个服务员觉得很有趣，但是领班很生气，让我立即清理所有东西，以防有人滑倒。


吃完早餐，十点左右，我们自己吃早餐。那时我已经饿了，只想坐下来安静地吃东西。但一些服务员开始取笑我的英国口音——他们都是苏格兰人。我想他们只是想让我高兴起来，开个玩笑，但我又心烦又饿，泪流满面地冲进卫生间！我以为每个人都讨厌我！等我回来的时候，他们已经把早餐的东西都收拾干净了，我还没来得及吃东西呢！


好吧，我们立即开始准备餐厅的午餐——清洁银器，摆好桌子，用吸尘器吸地板。房间里可以看到河边的美丽景色，后面是群山，但是当然，当我停下工作去看窗外时，领班发现了我并再次让我离开。


我在提供午餐方面做得还不错——其中一位服务员照顾我并教我如何做事。一位顾客点了一些昂贵的白葡萄酒，我从橱柜里给了他一瓶，而不是冰箱里的，所以不够冷。但幸运的是，其他服务员把我开错的瓶子藏了起来，我从冰箱里又给了他一瓶，这样领班就没有发现。我本来会很高兴，但我还有另一个问题，就是我起床太匆忙，只穿上了前一天晚上穿的鞋子。嗯，这些鞋子看起来很漂亮，但它们的鞋跟很高，在我的脚上几个小时后，我感到非常痛苦，我对此无能为力，当然也没有时间去换它们。我可以告诉你我再也没有穿那双鞋去上班了！


不管怎样，午饭后我们自己吃午饭了——这次我设法弄到了东西吃，而且下午我们有空。我和其他一个女孩一起去散步，我们有点迷路了，所以在我们六点回去工作之前我没有时间休息。当我们十点三十分左右吃完晚饭时，我已经筋疲力尽了。我想，我这辈子从来没有这么努力过。当然，那天晚上我也和其他女孩一起熬夜聊天，其他晚上的大部分时间我都在那里。我晚上就倒在床上，第二天早上七点就起床了，但不管你信不信，过了一段时间我就爱上了这份工作，甚至第二年我又回到那里工作了！不过，我和领班的关系一直不太融洽。

1. The Landsats 地球资源卫星 are two butterfly-shaped spacecraft that were sent into orbit around the earth in 1972 and 1975.


2. They circle (v.) the earth /14 times every 24 hours /at a height of 570 miles, or 918 kilometres, above the earth.


3. From the photographs 后定向前推进 *sent from* the satellites, scientists are learning things about the earth they have never known before.


4. In false colours, water is black, cities are blue-green, rock is brown, *healthy plants*  植物 are red and *diseased  有病的；患病的；病态的 plants* are green. The white areas show (v.)标示，表明（信息、时间、计量） barren 贫瘠的；不毛的 land.


5. Because photographs from the satellite are taken *looking directly down on the land* from such a height, they are *more* accurate *than* earlier photographs taken from airplanes.


6. `主` The second use 用途；功能；用法 of these Landsat photographs `系` is to help find oil and minerals.


7. Although these two Landsats have already produced a lot of very important information about the world, they are just the beginning.


8. Later /Landsats may be equipped to photograph (v.)拍照；照相 even smaller areas or they may be equipped with radar.

Landsat 是两艘蝴蝶形状的航天器，分别于 1972 年和 1975 年送入地球轨道。 +
它们每 24 小时绕地球 14 圈，高度为距地球 570 英里（918 公里）。 +
从卫星发送的照片中，科学家们正在了解他们以前从未了解过的关于地球的事情。 +
在假颜色中，水是黑色的，城市是蓝绿色的，岩石是棕色的，健康的植物是红色的，患病的植物是绿色的。白色区域表示贫瘠的土地。 +
由于卫星照片是从如此高的高度直接俯视陆地拍摄的，因此它们比早期从飞机上拍摄的照片更准确。 +
这些陆地卫星照片的第二个用途是帮助寻找石油和矿物。 +
尽管这两颗陆地卫星已经产生了许多关于世界的非常重要的信息，但这仅仅是开始。 +
以后的陆地卫星可能会配备拍摄更小的区域，或者可能配备雷达。

== 5. Body Positions



People often show their feelings by the body positions they adopt 采用（某方法）；采取（某态度）. These can contradict 相抵触；相矛盾；相反;反驳 what you are saying, especially when you are trying to disguise 假扮；装扮；伪装; 掩蔽；掩饰 the way you feel. For example, `主` a very common defensive position, assumed 假定的；假设的 when people feel threatened in some way, `系` is to put your arm or arms across your body. This is a way of *shielding 保护某人或某物（免遭危险、伤害或不快） yourself from* a threatening situation. `主` This shielding action `谓` can *be disguised 假扮；装扮；伪装 as* adjusting  调整；调节 one's cuff  袖口 or watchstrap 手表带. `主` Leaning back in your chair especially with your arms folded `系`  is not only defensive, it's also a way of showing your disapproval, of a need to distance yourself from the rest of the company.





`主` A position which betrays  出卖；泄露（机密） an aggressive attitude `系` is to avoid *looking directly at the person* you are speaking to. On the other hand, `主` approval and *desire to cooperate* `谓` are shown by copying the position of the person you are speaking to. This shows that /you agree or are willing to agree with someone. `主` The position of one's feet `谓` also often shows the direction  趋势；动向;目的；目标 of people's thoughts, for example, `主` feet or a foot 后定向前推进 pointing towards the door `谓` can indicate that a person wishes to leave the room. `主` The direction in which your foot points (v.)瞄准 `谓` can also show which of the people in the room you feel most *sympathetic 同情的；有同情心的；表示同情的;赞同的；支持的 towards*, even when you are not speaking directly to that person.

身体姿势


人们经常通过他们采取的身体姿势来表达他们的感受。这些可能与你所说的相矛盾，尤其是当你试图掩饰自己的感受时。例如，当人们感到某种方式受到威胁时，一种非常常见的防御姿势是将手臂放在身体上。这是保护自己免受威胁的一种方法。这种屏蔽动作可以伪装成调整袖口或表带。向后靠在椅子上，尤其是双臂交叉，不仅是防御性的，也是表达你的不满的一种方式，需要与公司其他人保持距离。


表现出攻击性态度的一个姿势是避免直视与你交谈的人。另一方面，通过模仿与你交谈的人的立场来表达认可和合作的愿望。这表明您同意或愿意同意某人的观点。脚的位置也常常表明人的思想方向，例如，脚或脚指向门可以表明一个人想要离开房间。你的脚指向的方向也可以表明你最同情房间里的哪一个人，即使你没有直接与那个人说话。
