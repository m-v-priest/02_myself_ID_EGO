Merchants came to China from Europe during the Tang (618–907) and Yuan dynasties via the Silk Road.  Under the Pax Mongolica, when China and much of Asia were ruled by the Mongols, many Europeans visited China to trade, some even working for the Yuan government. After the collapse of the Yuan in the mid-1300s, however, China had little contact with Europe.

Western merchants reentered the Chinese scene in the early 1500s when the Portuguese began trading along the southern China coast. Partly as a reward for their help in suppressing piracy and partly as a way to confine them to a specific locale, the Ming government allowed the Portuguese in 1557 to establish a permanent settlement at Macau (now written Macao), a small peninsula to the southwest of Hong Kong. Although the Qing banned overseas trade, Macau soon became the center of a “hemispheric exchange of commodities.”  Chinese goods such as silk, tea, and porcelain made their way from Macau to Europe in Portuguese galleons in exchange for silver from mines in Japan and the Americas. Through the efforts of European missionaries such as Matteo Ricci, Macau also became a base for the introduction of Christianity and Western learning to China.

By the 1600s, Britain was challenging Portugal and the Netherlands as the major European trading power in Asia.

In 1771 the EIC was allowed to open a post in Canton, which in 1759 the Qing government had declared the only legal Chinese port for overseas trade.

Britain, so the standard argument goes, took Hong Kong not to obtain more territory but rather to promote and protect its commercial interests in China. Hong Kong, explained Secretary for the Colonies Lord Stanley in 1843, was “occupied not with a view to colonization, but for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes.”

G.B. Endacott, until the 1970s the foremost historian of Hong Kong, wrote, “A healthy trade demanded settled conditions, suppression of robbery, guarantee of contract and of impartial justice. Since the Chinese were thought to be unable to provide these conditions, the British had to provide them.”

Hong Kong was indeed founded primarily as an imperial outpost rather than to civilize or Christianize its Chinese residents. After the British first occupied Hong Kong in 1839 during the First Opium War with China, few British officials considered seriously the idea of Hong Kong as a permanent colony. (It would not formally become a colony until June 26, 1843.)

||Settler Colony 拓殖型/定居型殖民地 |Exploitation/Commercial Colony 資源掠奪型/商業殖民地

|特點
|大量英國移民定居，希望長期紮根。最終形成了類似英國的政治和社會結構，這類殖民地最容易演變為"自治領" (因为有大量的英国本土移民, 是英国人的子嗣)。
|英國主要是為了獲取經濟資源（礦產、農作物）, 或建立貿易據點，移民數量較少，主要目的是經濟剝削。

|例子
|澳洲、紐西蘭、加拿大。
|印度、許多非洲殖民地。
