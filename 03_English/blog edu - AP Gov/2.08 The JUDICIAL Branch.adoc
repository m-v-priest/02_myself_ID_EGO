Hey there and welcome back to Heinler's History. Now we've been going through unit two of the AP government curriculum 课程, and in this video that means it's time to talk about the judicial branch 司法部门 of the federal government 联邦政府. So if you're ready to get them brain cal's milked judicial review 司法审查 style, then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain the principle 原则 of judicial review and how it checks 制约；限制 the power of the other institutions 机构 and state governments. Let's do this. First we'll talk about the structure 结构 of federal courts 联邦法院, then we'll talk about the power of the federal courts and how they use that power to check the other branches of government. +

First, let's talk about the structure of the federal court system. Now the first thing you think of when you hear federal court is probably the supreme court 最高法院, and you would not be wrong. But there is much more to the federal court system than the big daddy judiciary 司法系统 at the top of the food chain 处于最高地位. Essentially 本质上；基本上 there is a three-tier hierarchy 三级体系 to the federal court system. +

The supreme court sits on top and has the bragging rights 吹嘘的资本 of being the only court officially 正式地 established 建立 by the constitution 宪法. And just in case you're wondering, that's in article 3. Now the judges 法官 of the supreme court, as in every other level of the federal courts, are appointed 任命 by the president, confirmed 批准；确认 by the senate 参议院, and hold lifetime appointments 终身任命 on good behavior 行为良好 -- which when being translated means that if they don't act like a judicial turd, they have a job for life. +

Now we need to talk about the jurisdiction 管辖权 of the supreme court. That's a word that describes the extent 范围 of the power of the court, or in other words, what kind of cases this court can hear 审理. Now there are essentially two kinds of jurisdiction that a court can have: original jurisdiction 初审管辖权 and appellate jurisdiction 上诉管辖权. If a court has original jurisdiction, that just means that it can hear a case for the first time. But if a court has appellate jurisdiction, that means it can only hear appeals 上诉 from the lower courts 下级法院. +

So the supreme court has both original and appellate jurisdiction. However, the scope 范围 of the original jurisdiction for the supreme court is pretty narrow 狭窄的. If I decide to sue 起诉 that one guy who disliked my unit 1 review video for public defamation 公开诽谤, then my case will not end up before the supreme court but rather a lower court -- although I'm not sure there's a court low enough to hear such a dumb case. Anyway, the supreme court has original jurisdiction when there's a case between two states or when there's a case involving 涉及 an ambassador 大使 or other public official 公职人员 etc. But the majority of cases that appear before the supreme court are appeals, and thus the court makes use of its appellate jurisdiction. +

Okay, so that's big daddy judiciary on top. So where did all those other federal courts come from if they're not mentioned in the constitution? Well, article 3 section 1 tells us: "The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in 授予 one supreme court, and in such inferior courts 下级法院 as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish." So the supreme court is established by the constitution, and it also gives congress the power to establish lower courts as necessary 必要地. And in 1789, congress found it necessary to do so and passed the Judiciary Act of 1789 1789年司法法, which established the structure and jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. +

So the courts on the next rung down 下一级 from the supreme court are the 12 regional courts of appeals 地区上诉法院, and I hope you can already discern 看出；察觉 from the name that these courts have appellate jurisdiction. So the nation is divided into 12 regions, and each one has a court of appeals which hears appeals from the lower courts, and their job is basically to make sure that the law was applied correctly in those cases. Just for poops and giggles 开玩笑地说, you should probably know that these courts have three judges and no jury 陪审团. +

Then at the bottom of the federal court hierarchy are the U.S. district courts 美国地方法院, and there are 94 of these courts scattered throughout 分散于 the nation, and they have only original jurisdiction. If a case winds up 最终到达 here, it will be heard by a judge and a jury. Each state has at least one federal district court, and many states have more than one. +

So just to summarize 总结, let me show you how a case might travel through the federal court system. If a guy breaks a federal law 联邦法律, he will first stand trial 受审 before a judge and jury in a district court. But if he's not happy with that decision and thinks there's a reason for appeal, then that case will be heard by the three judges of that region's court of appeals. And then finally, if there is a further appeal, it will end up before the supreme court. Now everything I just said is way more simplistic 过于简单化的 than how it works in real life -- there are all sorts of factors that determine whether a case will be tried when and under what conditions -- but that's basically how it works. +

Okay, so now that we've talked ad nauseam 令人作呕地；不厌其烦地 about the structure of the federal courts, now let's shift 转换 and talk about the power of the courts, and we'll focus on the supreme court. And so for this you need to know the term judicial review. This means that the court has the power to rule on 对…作出裁决 the constitutionality 合宪性 of laws. Now this power is not explicitly 明确地 granted to the court by the constitution, so where did it come from? It came from one of your foundational documents 基础性文件 and one of your required supreme court cases 最高法院判例. +

So let's begin with the foundational document, namely Federalist 78, written by Alexander Hamilton. As always, I have a whole video going into depth on this document, so here I'm just going to give you the basics in summary form. So in this essay 文章, Hamilton argues that the independence 独立性 of the judicial branch -- which was achieved in large part by the lifetime appointments of its judges -- erected 建立 a protective wall 保护墙 around its power. And why is that? Well, Hamilton argued that the lifetime appointments insulated 使隔绝；使免受影响 the judges from political pressure 政治压力, and thus they could focus exclusively on 专注于 constitutional interpretations 宪法解释 of the laws. Additionally 此外, Hamilton argued that the nature 本质 of the court's power is its exercise of judicial review. The court, he said, should be able to consider the laws passed by the legislature 立法机构 and decide whether those laws align with 与…一致 the constitution or not, and if not, strike them down 废除；取消. +

Now where all of that came together for the supreme court was in one of your required cases, namely Marbury versus Madison 马伯里诉麦迪逊案 in 1803. Now again, I've devoted 投入；致力于 a whole video to this case, and I go into details about the facts of the case and everything you need to know, and since that's kind of complicated, I'll just tell you here that Marbury vs Madison was the case that established the precedent 先例 of judicial review for the supreme court. And when the court exercises its power of judicial review, it serves as the most potent 强有力的 checking power on the other branches that the court possesses 拥有. +

And if you want me to keep making these videos for you, then you can let me know that by subscribing 订阅, and you know me, I shall oblige 答应；满足要求. I'm out. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海因勒（Heinler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第二单元，在这个视频中，这意味着我们要谈谈联邦政府的司法部门。所以，如果你准备好以司法审查的方式来汲取知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释司法审查的原则，以及它如何制衡其他机构和州政府。我们开始吧。首先，我们来谈谈联邦法院的结构，然后我们会讨论联邦法院的权力，以及它们如何利用这种权力来制衡政府的其他部门。 +

首先，让我们谈谈联邦法院系统的结构。当你听到联邦法院时，你首先想到的可能是最高法院（Supreme Court），这想法没错。但联邦法院系统可不只是处于食物链顶端的最高法院而已。本质上，联邦法院系统有一个三层等级结构。 +

最高法院位于顶端，它拥有作为唯一由宪法正式设立的法院的资本。以防你有疑问，相关规定在宪法第三条。最高法院的法官，和联邦法院其他层级的法官一样，由总统任命，并由参议院确认，而且只要品行良好就能终身任职——换句话说，如果他们在司法方面没有不当行为，就能终身保有这份工作。 +

现在我们需要谈谈最高法院的管辖权（jurisdiction）。这个词描述的是法院权力的范围，换句话说，就是这个法院可以审理哪些类型的案件。基本上，法院有两种管辖权：初审管辖权（original jurisdiction）和上诉管辖权（appellate jurisdiction）。如果一个法院有初审管辖权，那就意味着它可以首次审理一个案件。但如果一个法院有上诉管辖权，那就意味着它只能审理来自下级法院的上诉案件。 +

所以最高法院既有初审管辖权也有上诉管辖权。然而，最高法院初审管辖权的范围相当狭窄。如果我决定起诉那个因为公开诽谤而不喜欢我第一单元复习视频的人，我的案件不会由最高法院审理，而是由下级法院审理——尽管我不确定有没有足够低级的法院会审理这么愚蠢的案件。不管怎样，当有涉及两个州之间的案件，或者涉及大使或其他公职人员等的案件时，最高法院拥有初审管辖权。但出现在最高法院的大多数案件都是上诉案件，因此最高法院行使它的上诉管辖权。 +

好的，这就是处于顶端的最高法院。那么，如果宪法没有提到其他联邦法院，这些法院是从哪里来的呢？宪法第三条第一款告诉我们：“合众国的司法权，属于最高法院以及由国会随时下令设立的下级法院。” 所以最高法院是由宪法设立的，并且宪法也赋予国会根据需要设立下级法院的权力。1789年，国会认为有必要这样做，于是通过了1789年《司法法》（Judiciary Act of 1789），该法案确立了下级联邦法院的结构和管辖权。 +

所以在最高法院之下的是12个地区上诉法院（regional courts of appeals），我希望你从名字就能看出这些法院拥有上诉管辖权。美国被划分为12个地区，每个地区都有一个上诉法院，它们审理来自下级法院的上诉案件，它们的工作基本上是确保法律在这些案件中得到正确适用。只是为了逗趣，你可能应该知道这些法院有三名法官，并且没有陪审团。 +

然后在联邦法院等级结构的最底层是美国地方法院（U.S. district courts），全国有94个这样的法院，它们只拥有初审管辖权。如果一个案件在这里审理，将由一名法官和一个陪审团进行审理。每个州至少有一个联邦地方法院，许多州有不止一个。 +

所以简单总结一下，让我告诉你一个案件在联邦法院系统中可能的审理流程。如果一个人违反了联邦法律，他首先会在地方法院由一名法官和一个陪审团进行审判。但如果他对判决不满意，并认为有上诉的理由，那么这个案件将由该地区上诉法院的三名法官进行审理。最后，如果还有进一步的上诉，案件将提交到最高法院。我刚才说的一切都比现实中的情况简单得多——有各种各样的因素决定一个案件何时以及在什么条件下进行审理——但这基本上就是审理流程。 +

好的，既然我们已经不厌其烦地讨论了联邦法院的结构，现在让我们转换一下话题，谈谈法院的权力，我们将重点关注最高法院。所以对于这一点，你需要知道 “司法审查”（judicial review）这个术语。这意味着法院有权对法律的合宪性做出裁决。这种权力并没有被宪法明确授予法院，那么它从何而来呢？它来自于一份基础文件和一个最高法院的必学案例。 +

所以让我们从基础文件开始，也就是亚历山大·汉密尔顿（Alexander Hamilton）撰写的《联邦党人文集》第78篇（Federalist 78）。和往常一样，我有一个完整的视频深入讲解这份文件，所以在这里我只给你基本的总结。在这篇文章中，汉密尔顿认为，司法部门的独立性——很大程度上是通过法官的终身任命实现的——为其权力筑起了一道保护墙。为什么呢？汉密尔顿认为，终身任命使法官免受政治压力，因此他们可以专注于对法律进行符合宪法的解释。此外，汉密尔顿认为，法院权力的本质在于行使司法审查权。他说，法院应该能够审议立法机构通过的法律，并决定这些法律是否符合宪法，如果不符合，就予以废除。 +

而最高法院将所有这些结合起来的一个必学案例是1803年的 “马伯里诉麦迪逊案”（Marbury versus Madison）。同样，我有一个完整的视频专门讲解这个案件，包括案件的事实以及你需要知道的所有内容。由于这个案件有点复杂，我在这里只告诉你，“马伯里诉麦迪逊案” 为最高法院确立了司法审查的先例。当法院行使其司法审查权时，它是法院拥有的对其他部门最有力的制衡权力。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取复习资料包，它将帮助你在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分。如果你希望我继续为你制作这些视频，你可以通过订阅让我知道，你了解我的，我会照做的。我说完了。 +
