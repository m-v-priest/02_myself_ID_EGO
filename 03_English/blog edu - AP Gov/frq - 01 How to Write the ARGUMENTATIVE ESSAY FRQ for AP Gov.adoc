== 释义

Hey there, welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at the most complex 复杂的 writing you're going to have to do for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 the argumentative essay 议论文. Is it difficult? Does it require you to use everything you've learned in this course? Yep. Are you going to punch it in the throat, yank out its armpit hair, and then deliberately 故意地 hurt its feelings? Oh yeah. Well alright then, let's get to it. +

So the argumentative essay is the last thing you'll have to do on your exam, and let me start by giving you some preliminaries 预备知识. It's an essay scored on a scale of six points, and you need to pay attention when I explain the rubric 评分标准 because these points build on each other 相互关联. Second, the suggested time that you're gonna have to write this essay is 40 minutes. Third, this essay is always going to focus on material from the nine foundational documents 基础文献 that are required in this course -- and if you need help on those, I've got videos explaining them all, so have a look. +

Okay, now with all that out of the way 说完这些, let me walk you through 带你了解 the three steps you need to follow in order to score well on this essay. Step number one: read the prompt 题目. And I know this sounds too obvious to even say out loud, but remember when I'm under pressure, I am dumber than I think, so I need to really take a minute and understand what they're asking me to do. Remember, if you misunderstand the prompt and yet write the most magnificent 精彩的 essay in the history of political science 政治学 on another topic, you will earn zero points, because you have to answer the prompt that they give you. +

So what should you be looking for in the prompt? Well, I think you should be looking for two things: the subject 主题 and the argument 论点. Let me just give you an example. Here's the prompt from the 2019 exam: "Develop an argument about whether the expanded powers of the national government benefits or hinders 阻碍 policy making." Okay, what is going to be the subject of my essay? The expanded powers of the national government. And second, what will I be arguing? Whether that benefits or hinders policymaking. So underline 划线 those things, mark them up, tattoo 纹身 them on your forehead -- just make sure you understand what they're asking you to do. +

Now they also give you a little introduction here, and that's helpful, so don't skip over 跳过 it. They also give you three required documents, and I'll show you what to do with those when we get to the preparation section, which is roughly 大致 now. Step two is to spend a few minutes planning your essay, and let me tell you what you need to do in this plan. The driving force 驱动力 of this essay is going to be the evidence 证据 that you produce in support of an argument, so spend a couple of minutes -- no more than a couple of minutes -- brainstorming 头脑风暴 and writing down all the potential pieces of specific evidence that you could use to address this prompt. +

You don't even have to have an argument yet -- all you're doing is mining 挖掘 the old brain folds for relevant vocabulary words. So in response to the prompt we just looked at, here's a few pieces of evidence that immediately come to mind. And if you're already starting to panic at this point because like you're not sure that you could remember this, don't worry, because look at this -- they've already given you three pieces of evidence that you could potentially use. +

Now I'll tell you what the requirements are for these in the third step, but for now, I'm just going to look at my prompt and think about how each of these documents might provide evidence for an argument. And notice they're going to give you documents that can support the argument in several different ways. So next to the Articles of Confederation 《邦联条例》, I'm just going to write a quick note about how the weakness of the central government hindered policymaking. Next to Brutus 1 《布鲁图斯第一篇》, I'm going to write a note about how a large republic will keep people from knowing their representatives and vice versa 反之亦然. Next to Federalist 10 《联邦党人文集》第10篇, I'm going to write "competition of factions 派系竞争". +

Now you should also think about some evidence that is not on this list. And since this is a question about federalism 联邦制, I'm just going to jot down 草草记下 "fiscal federalism 财政联邦制" since that has to do with 与…有关 policymaking. And I also think of Federalist 70 《联邦党人文集》第70篇, which has to do with the efficiency 效率 of a single executive 单一行政机构. Okay, now that's actually way more evidence than I need to score full points, but it's good to have more than you need. Just do a brain dump 自由表述 here, and it's gonna help you in the next step. +

Speaking of which, step three: get a six. Now in order to get a six, you need to get real cozy with 熟悉 the rubric, because the rubric tells you exactly what the readers of these essays are going to be looking for and the standard by which they're going to judge your writing. So let's get into the weeds 深入探讨 and talk about each point. +

The first section on the rubric is for the thesis 论点, and you can earn one point for it. Now technically, your thesis can be anywhere in the essay and still earn the point, but I strongly suggest that you put it either at the beginning or the end of your essay. And the reason is this: you want to signal to 向…表明 the reader that you know what you're doing and that you have a plan. Remember that these are human beings reading these essays, and you don't want them to have to go on a hunt to find your thesis. In order for you to earn the point -- now to be clear, they will go on a hunt for it and find it and give you the point if it's there -- but just make it easy for them and put it at the beginning or at the end. My suggestion is to put it first so that you know what you're doing and where you're going. +

Now as I'm fond of 喜欢 reminding my students, don't let your theses be feces （俚语，毫无价值的东西）. If you want to earn the thesis point, then you need to do two things: you need to make an argument and be specific with your evidence. So going back to the prompt we already looked at, here's the thesis that would earn the point: "The expanded powers of the national government benefit policymaking because of the strength of the Constitution, the increase of cooperative federalism 合作联邦制, and the advantages of fiscal federalism." +

Okay, this is a thesis written by a student, and notice it makes an argument: expanded powers benefit policymaking. And then it's also specific: why do expanded powers benefit policymaking? Because of the strength of the Constitution, the increase of cooperative federalism, and the advantages of fiscal federalism. Boom -- that gets the point because it makes an argument and is specific with the evidence. And those three pieces of evidence give you a roadmap 路线图 for how you're going to construct your body paragraphs 主体段落. +

Now the last thing I'll say about the thesis is this: I cannot overemphasize 过分强调 how important it is that you write a good argumentative thesis, because if you don't earn this point, the highest score you can get on the whole essay is one out of six. Because this whole essay is going to be about supporting an argument with evidence, then you have to have an argument to support. So get the thesis down, and you'll be fine. +

Okay, the next section on the rubric is the evidence section, and here you can earn up to three points. Now I debated whether to walk you through all the possibilities for how to get points or whether just to focus on how to get full points so everything will be a little simpler, but I think it's helpful for you to see how each of these points is awarded 授予 so you know exactly what to do to earn full points. +

So on the evidence section, you can start by earning zero points. You'll get this if your evidence is just flat out 完全地 wrong or too vague 模糊的. And to avoid the vague part, just make sure you're thinking about actual vocabulary words from your textbook or your notes or class or whatever -- that will keep you from being too vague. Okay, then you can earn one point here for naming one piece of evidence relevant to 与…相关 the topic of the prompt. For example, if you say, "Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government was weak and the states were strong," then that definitely is relevant to the prompt, but there's no real argumentation 论证 there. So if you do that, you will get one point. +

And by the way, when I said earlier that if you don't get the thesis point you can only earn one out of six, this is the point that you can earn. This is literally 简直 a soft toss from the College Board. It's like they're saying, "You know, we don't want a bunch of zeros on this essay, so what's the lowest possible bar that we can set?" And that's it. +

Okay, now let's talk about how you get two points in this section. This just builds on the previous point. If you successfully identify one piece of relevant evidence, you get one point. But if you use that evidence to support your thesis, that will earn you two points. And I'm going to show you the difference between just mentioning evidence and supporting an argument with evidence when we get to the next section of the rubric. Just to be clear, this piece of evidence doesn't have to come from those three documents listed there -- it can come from anywhere in the course, as long as it's relevant. +

But hey, you didn't click on this video to score two points on this section, so let me show you how to earn the full three points. This point also builds on the last point. And the last point, you earn two points for using one piece of evidence to support your thesis. Here, you just need to add one more piece of evidence to support your thesis, and that will get you three total points. However, let me hasten to add 赶紧补充说, in order to earn three points, at least one piece of evidence has to come from the documents they list in the prompt. The second piece can also come from another document in the list, or it can come from anywhere in the course, but one of them has to come from that list. +

Okay, so now that we've earned the thesis point and the three points for evidence, let's move to the next section of the rubric: the reasoning section 推理部分. And for this, you can earn up to one point. This point has to do with 与…有关 the evidence you've already used -- it's not for a third piece of evidence. Here, they want you to go one step beyond supporting your thesis with your evidence and go further by demonstrating 证明 how or why your evidence supports your thesis. You're probably like, "What?" So let me try to explain that as simply as I can. +

Essentially, you need to do three things with your evidence: you need to name it, explain it, and analyze it 分析它. Now to be fair, this isn't the only way to do it, but I think it's helpful to have a formula 公式. So name it -- like we're actually gonna write the name of our evidence here. Then explain it -- which is to say, define it for me. And then analyze it -- show me how that evidence supports your thesis. +

So let me just give you a student example with the prompt that we've been using: "The Articles of Confederation is a prime example 典型例子 of why a strong national government is better." Okay, I just named my evidence with the Articles. "The government could do very little. It made the states more independent by allowing them to have their own currency 货币 and impose 征收 their own taxes." There, the answer just explained what the government was like under the Articles. And now watch how it goes one step further and demonstrates how the evidence supports the thesis: "The Articles of Confederation made it harder to pass laws because each state has very different agendas 议程, and required over a majority of them to agree. To amend 修正 it required a unanimous decision 一致决定. This makes it nearly impossible to add a new amendment to change policy." Okay, that is how you earn the reasoning point. +

And the final section on the rubric is for an alternate perspective 替代观点, and for this you can earn one point. Now as you know -- or I've learned -- in this course, there is not a general consensus 共识 on damn near anything in politics. So in a couple of sentences, all you're going to do here is acknowledge 承认 an opposing view 相反观点, and then you're going to show how your argument makes better sense of the evidence. Now there are other ways to earn this point -- you can consult 查阅 the rubric if you want to know them -- but to me, this is the most straightforward 直接的 way that students understand: show an alternative perspective and then show why your argument is better. +

And here's a student example: "Some people may argue that the federal government is too large and that states are best suited to address the needs of their people without interference 干涉 from the federal government." Okay, that's the summary of the alternative perspective. Now why is my argument better? "However, this is not true. The state governments are not equipped to handle 处理 all the problems they face without the federal government. The federal government can act with uniformity 一致性 to affect all states to ensure that everyone is guaranteed the same protections as everyone else." And that's it. +

If you can do all of that, you will certainly earn a six on this essay. Best of luck.

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们要看看在美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中你需要完成的最复杂的写作任务，也就是议论文。它难吗？它是否要求你运用在这门课程中学到的所有知识呢？没错，确实是这样。你准备好全力应对，对它发起挑战，戳中它的要害，让它知道你的厉害吗？哦，是的。好吧，那我们开始吧。

所以，议论文是你在考试中要完成的最后一项任务，我先给你讲一些预备知识。这篇议论文的评分是六分制，我解释评分标准的时候你要认真听，因为这些分数是相互关联的。其次，建议你写这篇议论文的时间是40分钟。第三，这篇议论文总是围绕本课程要求的九个基础文献的内容来命题 —— 如果你在这些文献方面需要帮助，我有解释它们的视频，你可以看看。

好的，现在把这些都说完了，我来告诉你为了在这篇议论文上取得好成绩需要遵循的三个步骤。第一步：阅读题目要求。我知道这听起来太显而易见了，都没必要说出来，但要记住，当我处于压力之下时，我会比自己认为的更笨，所以我真的需要花一分钟时间来理解他们要求我做什么。记住，如果你误解了题目要求，然后写了一篇政治学历史上最精彩但与题目无关的文章，你将得零分，因为你必须回答他们给出的题目。

那么在题目要求中你应该找什么呢？嗯，我认为你应该找两个东西：主题和论点。我给你举个例子。这是2019年考试的题目：“就国家政府权力的扩大对政策制定是有益还是有阻碍展开论证。” 好的，我文章的主题是什么呢？国家政府权力的扩大。第二，我要论证什么呢？这种权力扩大对政策制定是有益还是有阻碍。所以把这些内容画出来，做上标记，甚至可以把它们纹在额头上 —— 一定要确保你理解了他们要求你做什么。

他们还会在这里给你一些介绍，这很有帮助，所以不要跳过。他们还会给你三篇必用文献，当我们讲到准备部分时我会告诉你如何使用这些文献，差不多就是现在要讲的内容。第二步是花几分钟时间规划你的文章，我来告诉你在这个规划中你需要做什么。这篇文章的核心是你用来支持论点的证据，所以花几分钟时间 —— 不超过几分钟 —— 进行头脑风暴，写下所有你能用来回答这个题目的潜在具体证据。

你甚至不必马上有一个论点 —— 你现在要做的就是从大脑中挖掘出相关的专业词汇。所以，针对我们刚刚看到的题目，这里有一些我立刻想到的证据。如果你在这一点上开始感到恐慌，因为你不确定自己是否能记住这些，别担心，看看这个 —— 他们已经给了你三条你可能会用到的证据。

现在我来告诉你这些证据的要求，这是第三步的内容，但现在，我只是看看题目，思考一下这些文献中的每一个可能如何为论点提供证据。要注意，他们给你的文献可以从几个不同的方面支持论点。所以在《邦联条例》（Articles of Confederation）旁边，我会快速写下中央政府的软弱如何阻碍了政策制定。在《布鲁图斯》第一篇（Brutus 1）旁边，我会写下关于一个大的共和国如何让人们无法了解他们的代表，反之亦然。在《联邦党人文集》第十篇（Federalist 10）旁边，我会写下 “派别的竞争”。

现在你也应该想想一些不在这个列表上的证据。既然这是一个关于联邦制的问题，我会写下 “财政联邦制”，因为这与政策制定有关。我还想到了《联邦党人文集》第七十篇（Federalist 70），它与单一行政机构的效率有关。好的，实际上这些证据已经远远超过了我得满分所需的数量，但证据多一些是有好处的。在这里把你想到的都写下来，这会对你的下一步有帮助。

说到下一步，第三步：得六分。为了得到六分，你需要熟悉评分标准，因为评分标准会确切地告诉你这篇文章的评卷人在寻找什么，以及他们评判你写作的标准。所以我们深入来讲讲每一个得分点。

评分标准的第一部分是关于论点的，这部分你可以得一分。从技术上讲，你的论点可以放在文章的任何位置，但我强烈建议你把它放在文章的开头或结尾。原因是这样的：你想向评卷人表明你知道自己在做什么，而且你有一个规划。记住，评卷人是普通人，你不想让他们费力去寻找你的论点。为了得到这一分 —— 要明确的是，如果论点在文章里，他们会去寻找并给你这一分 —— 但为了让他们更轻松，把论点放在开头或结尾。我的建议是把它放在开头，这样你就知道自己在做什么以及文章的方向。

我很喜欢提醒我的学生，不要让你的论点毫无价值。如果你想得到论点这一分，那么你需要做两件事：你需要提出一个论点，并且具体说明你的证据。所以回到我们刚刚看的题目，这里有一个能得分的论点：“国家政府权力的扩大对政策制定有益，这是因为宪法的力量、合作联邦制的增加以及财政联邦制的优势。”

好的，这是一个学生写的论点，注意它提出了一个论点：权力扩大对政策制定有益。然后它也很具体：为什么权力扩大对政策制定有益呢？因为宪法的力量、合作联邦制的增加以及财政联邦制的优势。太棒了 —— 这个论点能得分，因为它提出了一个论点并且具体说明了证据。这三条证据为你如何构建正文段落提供了一个路线图。

关于论点我要说的最后一点是：我再怎么强调写一个好的议论文论点的重要性都不为过，因为如果你得不到这一分，你在整篇文章中的最高得分只能是六分中的一分。因为整篇文章是要用证据来支持一个论点，所以你必须有一个论点来支持。所以确定好论点，你就没问题了。

好的，评分标准的下一部分是证据部分，这部分你最多可以得三分。我考虑过是带你了解得分的所有可能性，还是只专注于如何得满分，这样一切会更简单些，但我觉得让你看看每个得分点是如何评判的会很有帮助，这样你就确切知道如何得满分了。

所以在证据部分，你可能得零分。如果你的证据完全错误或太模糊，你就会得零分。为了避免模糊，要确保你考虑的是来自教科书、笔记或课堂等的实际专业词汇 —— 这会让你避免过于模糊。好的，然后如果你说出一个与题目主题相关的证据，你可以得一分。例如，如果你说 “在《邦联条例》下，中央政府很软弱，各州很强大”，那么这肯定与题目相关，但这里没有真正的论证。所以如果你这样写，你会得一分。

顺便说一下，我之前说过如果你得不到论点分，你在这部分最多只能得六分中的一分，就是指这个得分点。这简直是大学理事会（College Board）给的送分题。就好像他们在说：“你知道吗，我们不想这篇文章有一堆零分，所以我们能设定的最低标准是什么呢？” 就是这个得分点。

好的，现在我们来谈谈如何在这部分得两分。这是在前面得分的基础上的。如果你成功识别出一个相关证据，你得一分。但如果你用这个证据来支持你的论点，你可以得两分。当我们讲到评分标准的下一部分时，我会给你展示仅仅提到证据和用证据支持论点之间的区别。要明确的是，这个证据不一定来自列出的三篇文献 —— 它可以来自课程中的任何地方，只要它是相关的。

但是，嘿，你点进这个视频可不是为了在这部分得两分，所以我来告诉你如何得满分三分。这一分也是在前面得分的基础上的。上一个得分点，你用一个证据支持论点得两分。在这里，你只需要再添加一个证据来支持你的论点，这样你就可以得到总共三分。不过，我要赶紧补充一点，为了得到三分，至少有一个证据必须来自题目中列出的文献。第二个证据也可以来自列表中的另一个文献，或者来自课程中的任何地方，但其中一个必须来自那个列表。

好的，现在我们已经得到了论点分和证据部分的三分，让我们进入评分标准的下一部分：推理部分。在这部分你最多可以得一分。这一分与你已经使用的证据有关 —— 这不是为第三个证据准备的。在这里，他们希望你在用证据支持论点的基础上更进一步，说明你的证据是如何或为什么支持你的论点的。你可能会想：“什么？” 所以我尽量简单地解释一下。

本质上，对于你的证据你需要做三件事：你需要说出证据，解释证据，分析证据。公平地说，这不是唯一的方法，但我觉得有一个公式会很有帮助。所以说出证据 —— 就像我们实际上要在这里写下我们的证据名称。然后解释它 —— 也就是说，为我定义它。然后分析它 —— 向我展示这个证据是如何支持你的论点的。

所以我给你举一个学生的例子，还是用我们一直在用的题目：“《邦联条例》是为什么强大的国家政府更好的一个主要例子。” 好的，我刚刚说出了我的证据是《邦联条例》。“政府能做的非常少。它让各州更加独立，允许它们拥有自己的货币并征税。” 在那里，答案只是解释了《邦联条例》下的政府是什么样的。现在看看它是如何更进一步，展示证据是如何支持论点的：“《邦联条例》使得通过法律变得更加困难，因为每个州都有非常不同的议程，并且需要大多数州达成一致。修改条例需要全体一致的决定。这使得增加一个新的条例来改变政策几乎是不可能的。” 好的，这就是你得到推理分的方法。

评分标准的最后一部分是关于另一种观点的，在这部分你可以得一分。你知道 —— 或者我已经讲过 —— 在这门课程中，在政治方面几乎没有什么是大家普遍认同的。所以用几句话，你在这里要做的就是承认一种相反的观点，然后展示你的论点如何能更好地解释证据。还有其他方法可以得到这一分 —— 如果你想知道可以参考评分标准 —— 但对我来说，这是学生们最容易理解的直接方法：展示一种替代观点，然后展示为什么你的论点更好。

这里有一个学生的例子：“有些人可能会争辩说，联邦政府规模太大，各州最适合在不受联邦政府干涉的情况下满足其人民的需求。” 好的，这是对替代观点的总结。现在为什么我的论点更好呢？“然而，这不是真的。州政府没有能力在没有联邦政府的情况下处理它们面临的所有问题。联邦政府可以统一行动，影响所有州，以确保每个人都能得到与其他人相同的保护。” 就是这样。

如果你能做到以上这些，你肯定能在这篇议论文中得六分。祝你好运。好的，我希望这对你有帮助，如果你还需要更多帮助，点击这里获取我的终极复习资料包，里面有你在课堂上取得A的成绩以及在五月份的考试中获得5分所需的一切。如果你在其他类型的自由回答问题（FRQs）上需要帮助，可以查看这个播放列表。如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，一定要订阅，我会照做的。海姆勒，退出。 +

Hey there, welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at the most complex writing you're going to have to do for the AP Government curriculum, namely the argumentative essay. Is it difficult?

Okay, now with all that out of the way, let me walk you through the three steps you need to follow in order to score well on this essay. Step number one: read the prompt. And I know this sounds too obvious to even say out loud, but remember when I'm under pressure, I am dumber than I think, so I need to really take a minute and understand what they're asking me to do.

Now technically, your thesis can be anywhere in the essay and still earn the point, but I strongly suggest that you put it either at the beginning or the end of your essay.

Here, you just need to add one more piece of evidence to support your thesis, and that will get you three total points. However, let me hasten to add, in order to earn three points, at least one piece of evidence has to come from the documents they list in the prompt. The second piece can also come from another document in the list, or it can come from anywhere in the course, but one of them has to come from that list.

Okay, so now that we've earned the thesis point and the three points for evidence, let's move to the next section of the rubric: the reasoning section. And for this, you can earn up to one point. This point has to do with the evidence you've already used -- it's not for a third piece of evidence. Here, they want you to go one step beyond supporting your thesis with your evidence and go further by demonstrating how or why your evidence supports your thesis. You're probably like, "What?" So let me try to explain that as simply as I can.

Essentially, you need to do three things with your evidence: you need to name it, explain it, and analyze it. Now to be fair, this isn't the only way to do it, but I think it's helpful to have a formula. So name it -- like we're actually gonna write the name of our evidence here. Then explain it -- which is to say, define it for me. And then analyze it -- show me how that evidence supports your thesis.

So let me just give you a student example with the prompt that we've been using: "The Articles of Confederation is a prime example of why a strong national government is better." Okay, I just named my evidence with the Articles. "The government could do very little. It made the states more independent by allowing them to have their own currency and impose their own taxes." There, the answer just explained what the government was like under the Articles. And now watch how it goes one step further and demonstrates how the evidence supports the thesis: "The Articles of Confederation made it harder to pass laws because each state has very different agendas, and required over a majority of them to agree. To amend it required a unanimous decision. This makes it nearly impossible to add a new amendment to change policy." Okay, that is how you earn the reasoning point.

And the final section on the rubric is for an alternate perspective, and for this you can earn one point. Now as you know -- or I've learned -- in this course, there is not a general consensus on damn near anything in politics. So in a couple of sentences, all you're going to do here is acknowledge an opposing view, and then you're going to show how your argument makes better sense of the evidence. Now there are other ways to earn this point -- you can consult the rubric if you want to know them -- but to me, this is the most straightforward way that students understand: show an alternative perspective and then show why your argument is better.

And here's a student example: "Some people may argue that the federal government is too large and that states are best suited to address the needs of their people without interference from the federal government." Okay, that's the summary of the alternative perspective. Now why is my argument better? "However, this is not true. The state governments are not equipped to handle all the problems they face without the federal government. The federal government can act with uniformity to affect all states to ensure that everyone is guaranteed the same protections as everyone else." And that's it.

If you can do all of that, you will certainly earn a six on this essay. Best of luck.
