Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 3 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video that means it's time to talk about the doctrine of selective incorporation 选择性合并原则. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain the implications 影响 of the doctrine of selective incorporation. Okay, so if we're going to explain the implications of selective incorporation, I reckon 认为 we ought to define the term 定义术语 first. Selective incorporation 选择性合并 is the process by which the Bill of Rights 权利法案 is applied to the states 适用于各州. And if that still doesn't make sense to you, let me explain it up real nice. +

So in this unit, we've talked a lot about the Bill of Rights, which is to say the first 10 amendments 修正案 to the Constitution 宪法. And in those 10 amendments, we have laid out 阐述 for us our civil liberties 公民自由 to which we are entitled 有权享有 as citizens of the United States. But remember, when the Bill of Rights was ratified 批准 shortly after the Constitution was ratified, these were protections of our civil liberties against the federal government 联邦政府. So that means we have the right to the free exercise of religion 宗教信仰自由, and the federal government cannot suppress 压制 that. We have the right to a jury trial 陪审团审判, and the federal government cannot suppress that. +

But here's where I tell you that although the federal government was constrained 限制 in this way, the state governments 州政府 were not. And while some competing interpretations 相互冲突的解释 of individual liberties were debated between the state and federal governments in the early part of the republic, it really didn't become a big issue until after the Civil War 南北战争. As you know, the North fought the South and won that war, and one of the concerns of Congress after the war was that the racial hierarchy 种族等级制度 that had so long defined southern culture would lead to the systematic oppression 系统性压迫 of the newly freed black population 新获得自由的黑人人口. After all, these former enslaved people -- thanks to the 13th Amendment -- were now citizens of the United States, and that meant that the Bill of Rights applied to them also. But at that point, what was to keep those rebellious southern states 反叛的南方各州 from infringing upon 侵犯 the liberty of the free black population? +

The solution was the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案, and this one is important, so make sure you know it well. The 14th Amendment says this: "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge 剥夺 the privileges or immunities 特权或豁免权 of the citizens of the United States." In other words 换句话说, yes, the federal government must be restrained from infringing on 侵犯 the rights of citizens, and now the states are held to that same standard 遵循同样的标准. But it wasn't as if all 10 amendments were wholesale 全部地 applied at the state level at the same time. Mostly, this process of applying the Bill of Rights to the states has been an affair of the Supreme Court 最高法院. And so every time a case comes up and the ruling 裁决 applies one of the first 10 amendments to the states, that process is called selective incorporation. +

Okay, now that we know what selective incorporation is, let me give you two examples of it: one in which the Supreme Court upheld 支持 the state law, and one in which state laws were overturned 推翻. So the first example comes in a non-required case called Reynolds v. the United States in 1879. In this case, a Utah man named George Reynolds had himself a plurality of wives 多个妻子. And you know, he was a Mormon 摩门教徒, and in those days, the practice of polygamy 一夫多妻制 was an important doctrine 教义 of the Mormon church. So even though Utah state outlawed 宣布…为非法 polygamy, Reynolds argued that his religion required him to continue adding to his pantheon of wives 妻子群体, and furthermore 此外, the Utah government needed to stay out of it 不要干涉 because Reynolds' right to the free exercise of religion. +

Well, the Supreme Court went ahead and disagreed with him on this count 这一点, and said that while it would surely be unconstitutional 违宪的 for a state to legislate against 立法反对 a person's belief in polygamy, they could definitely legislate against the practice of it. So that's an example of the Supreme Court upholding a state law in the process of selective incorporation. +

And now let's have a look at when the court went the other way 作出相反裁决, and for that let's consider one of your required cases, namely McDonald v. Chicago in 2010. Now I've got a whole video explaining the details of this case, but here we'll just talk in generality 大致地. So recall 回想 in the Unit 3 Topic 5 video, we talked about the case Heller v. District of Columbia, in which the Supreme Court overturned the restrictive gun laws 限制性枪支法律 in Washington D.C. However, since D.C. is a federal district 联邦特区, that ruling did not apply to the states. But that's where McDonald v. Chicago comes in. +

So Chicago had a law requiring all handguns 手枪 to be registered 登记, but the kick in the face 令人讨厌的是 was that the city had rejected all registration of those guns since the early 80s. In other words 换句话说, while handguns were like technically legal 理论上合法, in reality 实际上 it was an impossibility to own one. And so the case was brought before the Supreme Court in the wake of 在…之后 the Heller decision, and it was argued that if the court ruled that the Second Amendment 第二修正案 allowed citizens of Washington D.C. to own handguns, that should also be the case for the states. And the court agreed, but narrowly in a 5-4 decision. And in that way, the Second Amendment was incorporated to the states 适用于各州. +

The last thing I'll say is this: we've talked about what it means to incorporate the Bill of Rights to the states, but what is the selective 选择性的 part of it talking about? Well, remember what I said earlier, namely that the first 10 amendments were not wholesale applied to the states all at once 一次性全部适用. As a case comes up, then incorporation happens selectively -- in other words 换句话说, not all at once 不是同时地. And at this point, the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments 第一、二、四、五、六和第八修正案 have all been selectively incorporated to the states through various SCOTUS (Supreme Court of the United States 美国最高法院) decisions. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第三单元，在这个视频中，意味着我们要讨论选择性合并原则。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释选择性合并原则的影响。好的，所以如果我们要解释选择性合并的影响，我认为我们应该先定义这个术语。选择性合并是将《权利法案》应用于各州的过程。如果这对你来说还不理解，让我好好解释一下。 +

所以在这个单元中，我们已经多次谈到《权利法案》，也就是宪法的前十条修正案。在这十条修正案中，规定了我们作为美国公民所应享有的公民自由。但要记住，当《权利法案》在宪法批准后不久获得批准时，它是对我们公民自由免受联邦政府侵犯的保护。这意味着我们有自由践行宗教的权利，联邦政府不能压制它。我们有接受陪审团审判的权利，联邦政府也不能压制它。 +

但在这里我要告诉你，虽然联邦政府受到这样的约束，但州政府却不受此约束。在美国建国初期，州政府和联邦政府之间就个人自由的不同解释存在争议，但直到内战之后，这才成为一个重大问题。如你所知，北方与南方作战并赢得了那场战争，战后国会关注的一个问题是，长期以来定义南方文化的种族等级制度会导致对新获得自由的黑人人口的系统性压迫。毕竟，多亏了第十三修正案，这些曾经被奴役的人现在是美国公民，这意味着《权利法案》也适用于他们。但在那时，要如何防止那些反叛的南方各州侵犯自由黑人人口的自由呢？ +

解决方案就是第十四修正案，这个修正案很重要，所以一定要好好了解它。第十四修正案规定：“任何州都不得制定或执行任何会剥夺美国公民的特权或豁免权的法律。” 换句话说，是的，联邦政府必须受到约束，不能侵犯公民权利，现在各州也必须遵循同样的标准。但并不是说这十条修正案同时全部适用于州一级。大多数情况下，将《权利法案》应用于各州的过程是由最高法院来进行的。所以每当有一个案件出现，且裁决将前十条修正案中的某一条应用于各州时，这个过程就叫做选择性合并。 +

好的，现在我们知道了选择性合并是什么，让我给你举两个例子：一个是最高法院支持州法律的例子，一个是州法律被推翻的例子。第一个例子来自1879年的一个非必学案件 “雷诺兹诉美国案”（Reynolds v. the United States）。在这个案件中，一个名叫乔治·雷诺兹（George Reynolds）的犹他州男子有多个妻子。你知道，他是一名摩门教徒，在那个时候，一夫多妻制是摩门教的一个重要教义。所以，尽管犹他州将一夫多妻制定为非法，雷诺兹辩称他的宗教要求他继续增加他的妻子数量，而且犹他州政府不应干涉，因为这涉及雷诺兹自由践行宗教的权利。 +

嗯，最高法院在这一点上不同意他的观点，并表示虽然一个州立法反对一个人对一夫多妻制的信仰肯定是违宪的，但他们绝对可以立法反对一夫多妻的行为。所以这是最高法院在选择性合并过程中支持州法律的一个例子。 +

现在让我们看看最高法院做出相反裁决的情况，为此我们来考虑一个必学案件，即2010年的 “麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案”（McDonald v. Chicago）。我有一个完整的视频来解释这个案件的细节，但在这里我们只做一般性的讨论。回想一下在第三单元第五主题的视频中，我们谈到了 “海勒诉哥伦比亚特区案”（Heller v. District of Columbia），在这个案件中，最高法院推翻了华盛顿特区（Washington D.C.）的限制性枪支法律。然而，由于哥伦比亚特区（D.C.）是一个联邦特区，那个裁决并不适用于各州。但这就是 “麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案” 的意义所在。 +

所以芝加哥有一项法律要求所有手枪都要登记，但问题在于，自80年代初以来，这座城市拒绝了所有手枪的登记。换句话说，虽然从技术层面上手枪是合法的，但实际上拥有手枪是不可能的。所以在 “海勒案” 的裁决之后，这个案件被提交到最高法院，有人认为，如果法院裁定第二修正案允许华盛顿特区的公民拥有手枪，那么这也应该适用于各州。最高法院同意了这一观点，不过是以5比4的微弱多数通过的。就这样，第二修正案被应用到了各州。 +

我要说的最后一点是：我们已经讨论了将《权利法案》应用于各州意味着什么，但其中 “选择性” 的部分指的是什么呢？嗯，记住我之前说的，前十条修正案并不是一下子全部应用于各州的。每当有一个案件出现，合并是以选择性的方式发生的 —— 换句话说，不是一下子全部应用。在这一点上，第一、第二、第四、第五、第六和第八修正案都通过最高法院的各种裁决被选择性地应用到了各州。 +
