Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're looking at another one of your required 必修的；规定的 Supreme Court 最高法院 cases in the AP Government curriculum 课程；课程大纲, and that means it's time to look at Shaw v. Reno. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked 挤脑汁（幽默用法） gerrymandering 拼区划；划分选区以操纵选举 style, well then let's get to it. +

Okay, so first, as always, let's begin with the facts 事实 of the case. Back in 1990, none of North Carolina's representatives 代表 were black, and that was a problem because 20% of the state's population 人口 was black. So when it was time for reapportionment 重新分配（尤指选区席位） after the 1990 census 人口普查, North Carolina drew one district 选区；行政区 which was majority black and then submitted 提交 it to the Justice Department 司法部 for review 审查；评估. And then upon that review, the Justice Department said, "We think you can get a second majority black district if you try real hard." And that's what they did. +

And the second majority black district came out looking like this. Just in case you don't study the shapes of congressional 国会的；立法机构的 districts in your spare time, you might not realize that this district is -- to use the technical 技术性的；专业的 political science term -- wonky 古怪的；不规则的 as heck （非正式）非常. And when you see a district like that, it's an example of gerrymandering 拼区划；划分选区以操纵选举. +

Now if you don't know what that means, let me just give you a quick definition 定义 because you have to know it to understand this case. Gerrymandering 拼区划 is when congressional districts are drawn 划定 to favor 有利于；偏袒 one group over another. Now partisan 党派的 gerrymandering is when districts are drawn to favor one political party 政党 over another, and I explained that in another video like this: suppose you have 50 people divided into five districts, and 40% are Republicans and 60% are Democrats. If you draw the districts like this, Democrats will always win these three districts and Republicans will always win these two districts. But if you draw the districts like this, Democrats will win in every district. Either way, more districts will be voting Democrat than Republican. But suppose some wily 狡猾的 Republican draws the districts like this, then look what happens: Republicans will hold majorities 多数；过半数 in three of the districts, and now Democrats only have two. So that's what we call partisan gerrymandering, where districts are redrawn 重画；重新划分 to favor one party over another. +

But Shaw v. Reno isn't a case about partisan gerrymandering, but rather racial 种族的 gerrymandering, which is when districts are drawn to favor one racial group over another. Now the only reason any of this was an issue 问题；争议 is because of a provision 条款；规定 in the Voting Rights Act 投票权法案 of 1965 which said that if certain states change their districts, it must first be approved 批准；认可 by the federal government 联邦政府. That's why North Carolina was sending their plan to the Justice Department to begin with. +

Okay, so what was the constitutional 宪法的 principle 原则 at stake 处于危险中；受到威胁? This case was argued on the merits 实质理由；基本依据 of the Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款 of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案. On one side, those citizens in Shaw's group argue that the Equal Protection Clause was violated 违反；侵害 because the districts were drawn only with race in mind. On Reno's side, they argued that the Equal Protection Clause was not violated because these districts were drawn with the intention 意图；目的 of helping black residents 居民 who had been the object of historical 历史上的 discrimination 歧视；区别对待. +

So think about that carefully. Some residents are complaining 抱怨；指责 that these districts were drawn for the sole 唯一的；仅有的 purpose of electing black representatives to the legislature 立法机关, and that's wrong because the constitution is colorblind 不因肤色区别对待的. And the Justice Department agrees: yes, these districts were drawn to favor one race over another, and that's okay when the race under consideration 被考虑的 is one that has been marginalized 边缘化 in the past. So the Justice Department isn't arguing with their interpretation 解释；理解: yes, by a strict 严格的 colorblind reading of the constitution this is wrong, but the argument goes the constitution ought not be colorblind, and we ought to favor the marginalized 被边缘化的人群 where we can in order to create a more equitable 公平合理的 society. +

Okay, so what was the decision 判决；裁定? Well, the court ruled 裁定 against Reno and the Justice Department, arguing that while these districts may have been drawn with noble 高尚的 intentions 意图；目的, districts drawn only based on race were unconstitutional 违宪的 because it sets a dangerous 危险的 precedent 先例；范例. Like, if this iteration 变体；版本 of racial gerrymandering were approved, what's to stop the majority 多数的 races in power from doing the same? Thus, yes, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment was violated by these strange districts. +

So that was the decision. Now let's look at why the case matters. Shaw v. Reno set a precedent for future cases involving racial gerrymandering, and to this day districts cannot be drawn only with the intent 意图；目的 to gather those of the same race into voting districts. And this has been challenged 受到质疑；被提出异议 on several occasions 场合；时候 over the years, and the decision still stands 仍然有效. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个最高法院的必学案例，这意味着我们要看看 “肖诉雷诺案”（Shaw v. Reno）。所以，如果你准备好以不公正划分选区（gerrymandering）的方式来汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

好的，首先，和往常一样，让我们从这个案件的事实开始。早在1990年，北卡罗来纳州（North Carolina）没有黑人代表，这是个问题，因为该州20%的人口是黑人。所以在1990年人口普查后进行选区重新划分时，北卡罗来纳州划分出一个黑人占多数的选区，然后将其提交给司法部（Justice Department）进行审查。在审查时，司法部表示：“如果你们非常努力的话，你们可以划分出第二个黑人占多数的选区。” 于是他们照做了。 +

第二个黑人占多数的选区是这样的。以防你在业余时间不研究国会选区的形状，你可能没有意识到这个选区——用政治科学的专业术语来说——非常古怪。当你看到这样的选区时，这就是不公正划分选区（gerrymandering）的一个例子。 +

如果你不知道这意味着什么，让我快速给你下个定义，因为你得知道这个才能理解这个案件。不公正划分选区（gerrymandering）是指划分国会选区时偏袒某一群体。党派不公正划分选区（partisan gerrymandering）是指划分选区时偏袒某一政党，我在另一个视频中是这样解释的：假设你有50个人被划分到五个选区，其中40%是共和党人，60%是民主党人。如果你这样划分选区，民主党人将总是赢得这三个选区，而共和党人将总是赢得这两个选区。但如果你这样划分选区，民主党人将在每个选区获胜。不管怎样，投票给民主党人的选区会比投票给共和党人的选区多。但假设某个狡猾的共和党人这样划分选区，那么看看会发生什么：共和党人将在三个选区中占多数，而现在民主党人只有两个选区。所以这就是我们所说的党派不公正划分选区，即重新划分选区以偏袒某一政党。 +

但 “肖诉雷诺案”（Shaw v. Reno）不是关于党派不公正划分选区的案件，而是关于种族不公正划分选区（racial gerrymandering），即划分选区时偏袒某一种族群体。这之所以成为一个问题，唯一的原因是1965年《选举权法案》（Voting Rights Act of 1965）中的一项规定，该规定指出，如果某些州改变他们的选区，必须首先得到联邦政府的批准。这就是为什么北卡罗来纳州一开始要将他们的选区划分计划提交给司法部。 +

好的，那么这个案件所涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？这个案件是基于第十四修正案（14th Amendment）的平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）的实质内容进行辩论的。一方面，肖（Shaw）那一方的公民认为平等保护条款被违反了，因为划分选区时只考虑了种族因素。在雷诺（Reno）那一方，他们认为平等保护条款没有被违反，因为划分这些选区的意图是帮助历史上受到歧视的黑人居民。 +

所以仔细想想这个问题。一些居民抱怨说，划分这些选区的唯一目的是选出黑人代表进入立法机构，而这是错误的，因为宪法是不考虑肤色的。司法部也认同这一点：是的，这些选区的划分偏袒了某一种族，但是当所考虑的种族是历史上被边缘化的种族时，这种做法是可以接受的。所以司法部并不是不同意对宪法的解释：是的，严格按照不考虑肤色的方式解读宪法，这种做法是错误的，但是有一种观点认为宪法不应该完全不考虑肤色，为了创建一个更公平的社会，我们应该尽可能地偏袒那些被边缘化的群体。 +

好的，那么裁决是什么呢？嗯，法院做出了不利于雷诺和司法部的裁决，认为虽然这些选区的划分可能出于高尚的意图，但是仅基于种族划分选区是违宪的，因为这开创了一个危险的先例。比如说，如果这种种族不公正划分选区的做法被批准，那有什么能阻止占多数的种族权力群体也这么做呢？因此，是的，第十四修正案的平等保护条款被这些奇怪的选区所违反。 +

这就是裁决内容。现在让我们看看这个案件为什么重要。“肖诉雷诺案”（Shaw v. Reno）为未来涉及种族不公正划分选区的案件开创了先例，直到今天，不能仅仅为了把同一种族的人聚集到选区而划分选区。多年来，这个裁决面临过几次挑战，但它仍然有效。 +
