hey there and welcome back to heimlich's history, and further welcome to another video in our foundational documents 基础文献 series for ap government. in this video we're going to be considering 思考；研究 brutus number one. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milk participatory style （以参与的方式获取知识）, well then let's get to it. +

so in the last video i talked about federalist 10, and the ap overlords （此处指AP课程的主导者）are concerned that you understand the debate between that document and brutus one. now by way of reminder 提醒, the federalist papers 联邦党人文集 argued for the ratification 批准 of the constitution, while the anti-federalist papers 反联邦党人文集 -- of which brutus number one is the first -- argued against ratification of the constitution. and both sets of essays were published in new york newspapers to try to persuade the public one way or the other （以某种方式说服公众）. +

now while federalist 10 argued for the merits 优点；价值 of a republican-style government 共和制政府 for a large nation like the united states, brutus is going to take an anti-constitutional dump all over that argument （强烈反对该论点）, and let's see how he does it. and by the way there is a debate who actually wrote brutus one, so i'm just gonna call him brutus. and if it helps you remember what this document is all about, just remember that brutus was one of the guys who assassinated 暗杀 julius caesar who happened to lead a very powerful centralized government 中央集权政府. +

okay so let's get into the document. the main question brutus is attempting to answer is this: "the first question that presents itself on the subject is, whether a confederated government 邦联制政府 be the best for the united states or not." now a confederated government -- in case you don't know -- is the kind of government that the united states had under the articles of confederation 邦联条例. the states had all the power and the central government had very little. in fact you might say that there were 13 governments in the early united states -- one for each state -- that were loosely tied together by a weak central authority 中央权力机构. +

okay so continuing: "or in other words, whether the 13 united states should be reduced to one great republic 共和国, governed by one legislature 立法机构, and under the direction of one executive 行政机构 and judicial 司法机构, or whether they should continue 13 confederated republics, under the direction and control of a supreme federal head 最高联邦首脑 for certain defined national purposes only." +

okay so the question is this: which is better for this new freedom-loving nation -- a confederacy 邦联 of state governments or a powerful central government? and brutus argued in no uncertain terms 明确地 that a confederacy is better than the republic that the constitution would establish. there are several arguments brutus makes in support of this claim, chief among them is that oh so odious 可憎的；讨厌的 necessary and proper clause 必要且适当条款 in article 1 section 8 of the constitution, which says that congress can make any law which shall be necessary and proper to the execution of its enumerated powers 列举权力. and causing a further stench 恶臭 in brutus's nostrils （引起强烈反感）is the supremacy clause 至上条款 in article 6 which says that federal laws have greater authority 权威 than state laws. +

so what's the problem with that? well brutus help me out: "it appears from these articles that there is no need of any intervention 干预 of the state governments between the congress and the people to execute any one power vested in 赋予 the general government, and that the constitution and laws of every state are nullified 废除 and declared void 无效 so far as they shall be inconsistent with this constitution." and so what happens in that case? "all power that is reserved for the individual states must very soon be annihilated 消灭, except so far as they are barely necessary for the organization of the general government." +

so brutus main concern 主要担忧 is that by creating a central authority who can -- by the necessary and proper clause -- pass any law imaginable 可想象的, and by which the supremacy clause can crush 压制 any state law under its big hairy feet （形象表述，以强势姿态压制）, that state governments will just shrivel up and die 萎缩消亡. but this is not just theoretical 理论上的 for brutus. he gives several examples of how this death of state power could happen, but we'll only look at the most pressing example 最紧迫的例子: the collection of taxes 税收征收. +

"in the business therefore of laying and collecting taxes, the idea of confederation 邦联制 is totally lost, and that of one entire republic is embraced. it is proper here to remark 评论 that the authority to lay and collect taxes is the most important of any power that can be granted. it connects with almost all other powers. everyone who has thought on this subject must be convinced that but small sums of money can be collected in any country by direct taxes 直接税. hence when the federal government begins to exercise the right of taxation 征税权 in all its parts, the legislatures of the several states will find it impossible to raise monies to support their own governments. without money they cannot be supported, and they must dwindle away 逐渐缩小, and as before observed their powers will be absorbed in that of the general government." +

in other words, any government that exists can only collect a small amount of taxes -- otherwise the citizens will grow weary of that taxation 对税收感到厌烦 and throw the government off （反抗政府）. so if the federal government is going to collect taxes, and there's only a small amount that people will tolerate 容忍, how will the states also collect taxes? and if states cannot collect taxes they'll shrivel up and die, and now you've got one big powerful government left in their way. +

now brutus goes on to make the same argument about the federal courts 联邦法院: if the federal courts trump 胜过；凌驾于 state courts, then state courts will soon be rendered obsolete 过时的 and unnecessary. and then the final part of the argument is about the size of the nation and how by its sheer girth 巨大规模 a republican form of government is not well suited to be installed 不适合建立. and brutus pulls out the big guns （使用有力论据）for this argument, quoting the baron de montesquieu who said in his treatise 论著 the spirit of the laws 论法的精神: "it is natural to a republic to have only a small territory 领土, otherwise it cannot long subsist 存续." +

wait why can't a republican government work in a big territory with a lot of people? well brutus will answer that question with a question: "is it practicable 可行的 for a country so large and so numerous as they will soon become to elect a representation 代表 that will speak to their sentiments 表达他们的想法, without their becoming so numerous as to be incapable of transacting public business 处理公共事务? it certainly is not." okay he answered it with a question and an answer, but whatever. his point is with a nation as large as the united states -- both in territory and in people -- how could elected representatives possibly keep their fingers on the pulse of （了解；掌握）everyone whom they represent? and brutus's answer is simple: it's not possible. +

and the problem in that situation is as follows: "confidence which the people have in their rulers in a free republic arises from their knowing them, from their being responsible to them for their conduct 行为, and from the power they have of displacing them 罢免他们 when they misbehave 行为不当. but in a republic of the extent of this continent, the people in general will be acquainted with 了解 very few of their rulers. the people at large 广大民众 would know very little of their proceedings 行动, and it would be extremely difficult to change them." +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆利希（Heimlich）历史课，也欢迎来到我们美国大学预修课程政府学基础文件系列的另一个视频。在这个视频中，我们将探讨《布鲁图斯》第一篇（Brutus number one）。所以，如果你准备好以参与的方式汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

在上一个视频中，我谈到了《联邦党人文集》第十篇（Federalist 10），美国大学预修课程的主导者们希望你们理解这份文件与《布鲁图斯》第一篇之间的争论。提醒一下，《联邦党人文集》主张批准宪法，而反联邦党人的文章——《布鲁图斯》第一篇是其中的第一篇——反对批准宪法。这两组文章都发表在纽约的报纸上，试图从不同方面说服公众。 +

《联邦党人文集》第十篇主张像美国这样的大国实行共和制政府的优点，而《布鲁图斯》则要对这个论点进行反驳，我们来看看他是怎么做的。顺便说一下，关于到底是谁写了《布鲁图斯》第一篇存在争议，所以我就称作者为布鲁图斯（Brutus）。如果这有助于你记住这份文件的主旨，只要记住布鲁图斯是刺杀了恰好领导着一个非常强大的中央政府的尤利乌斯·凯撒（Julius Caesar）的人之一就行了。 +

好的，让我们深入研究这份文件。《布鲁图斯》试图回答的主要问题是：“关于这个主题，首先出现的问题是，一个邦联制政府对美国来说是否是最好的。” 顺便说一下，邦联制政府是美国在《邦联条例》（articles of confederation）下所实行的那种政府形式。各州拥有所有权力，而中央政府权力非常小。实际上，你可以说在早期的美国有13个政府——每个州一个——它们由一个软弱的中央权力机构松散地联系在一起。 +

好的，继续：“换句话说，是13个美国州应该缩减成一个伟大的共和国，由一个立法机构治理，并在一个行政和司法机构的指导下，还是它们应该继续作为13个邦联共和国，只在一个最高联邦首脑的指导和控制下，为某些明确的国家目的而存在。” +

所以问题是：对于这个热爱自由的新国家来说，是州政府组成的邦联更好，还是一个强大的中央政府更好？布鲁图斯毫不含糊地认为，邦联比宪法所建立的共和国更好。布鲁图斯提出了几个论点来支持这个主张，其中最主要的是宪法第一条第八款中那个非常可憎的 “必要和适当条款”，该条款规定国会可以制定任何对于执行其列举权力来说是必要和适当的法律。同样让布鲁图斯深恶痛绝的是宪法第六条中的 “最高权力条款”，该条款规定联邦法律比州法律更具权威性。 +

那么，这有什么问题呢？嗯，布鲁图斯帮我说明了：“从这些条款可以看出，在国会和人民之间，不需要任何州政府的干预来执行赋予联邦政府的任何一项权力，而且每个州的宪法和法律，只要与这部宪法不一致，就会被废除并宣布无效。” 那么在那种情况下会发生什么呢？“除了对于组织联邦政府来说勉强必要的权力之外，所有留给各个州的权力很快就会被消灭。” +

所以，布鲁图斯主要担心的是，通过设立一个中央权力机构，它可以依据 “必要和适当条款” 通过任何可以想象到的法律，并且依据 “最高权力条款” 可以践踏任何州法律，州政府很快就会萎缩消亡。但对布鲁图斯来说，这不仅仅是理论上的担忧。他举了几个例子来说明州权力可能会如何消亡，但我们只看最紧迫的一个例子：税收的征收。 +

“因此，在征税和收税这件事上，邦联的概念完全被抛弃了，取而代之的是一个完整的共和国的概念。在这里有必要指出，征税和收税的权力是可以被授予的任何权力中最重要的。它与几乎所有其他权力都相关。任何思考过这个问题的人都必须相信，在任何一个国家，通过直接税只能征收到很少的钱。因此，当联邦政府开始全面行使征税权时，各个州的立法机构会发现，他们不可能筹集到足够的钱来维持自己政府的运转。没有钱，州政府就无法维持，它们必然会逐渐萎缩，而且正如之前所观察到的，它们的权力将被联邦政府吸收。” +

换句话说，任何存在的政府只能征收少量的税——否则公民就会对税收感到厌烦并推翻政府。所以，如果联邦政府要征税，而人们只能容忍少量的税收，那么各州又该如何征税呢？如果各州无法征税，它们就会萎缩消亡，这样一来，就只剩下一个强大的政府了。 +

现在，布鲁图斯接着对联邦法院提出了同样的论点：如果联邦法院的权力高于州法院，那么州法院很快就会变得过时且没有必要。然后，争论的最后一部分是关于国家的规模，以及一个共和制政府为何根本不适合在这样的规模下建立。为了这个论点，布鲁图斯搬出了大杀器，引用了孟德斯鸠男爵（the baron de Montesquieu）在他的《论法的精神》（the spirit of the laws）中说的话：“一个共和国自然只能在小领土上存在，否则它就无法长久维持。” +

等等，为什么共和制政府在一个领土广大、人口众多的国家就行不通呢？嗯，布鲁图斯会用一个问题来回答这个问题：“对于一个像美国这样幅员辽阔、人口众多的国家来说，选举出一个能够表达民众情感的代表机构，而这个代表机构又不会庞大到无法处理公共事务，这真的可行吗？当然不可行。” 好吧，他用一个问题和一个答案来回答了这个问题，但不管怎样。他的观点是，对于像美国这样一个在领土和人口方面都如此庞大的国家，当选的代表怎么可能真正了解他们所代表的每一个人的想法呢？布鲁图斯的答案很简单：这是不可能的。 +

这就是你需要了解的关于《布鲁图斯》第一篇的内容。如果你需要帮助以便在课堂上拿到A，并在五月份的考试中得到5分，那么点击这里获取学习资料包。如果你想观看更多关于基础文件的视频，可以在这里查看，如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那就订阅来告诉我吧。海姆勒（Heimlich）退场。 +
