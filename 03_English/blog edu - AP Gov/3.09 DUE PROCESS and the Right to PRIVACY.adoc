Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 3 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video it's time to talk about the constitutional right to privacy 宪法规定的隐私权. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked implicitly 含蓄地, then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain the extent 程度 to which states are limited by the due process clause 正当程序条款 from infringing upon 侵犯 individual rights 个人权利. Now the operative word 关键词 in that learning objective is states -- how are states limited from infringing upon individual rights? Remember, we've been talking about the process of selective incorporation 选择性合并, which is how the Supreme Court 最高法院 has applied the protections of the Bill of Rights 权利法案 to the states. And they're able to do that because of the equal protection clause 平等保护条款 of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案, which says: "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge 剥夺 the privileges or immunities 特权或豁免权 of the citizens of the United States, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction 管辖范围内 the equal protection of the laws." So this is an amendment mandating 强制规定 protection of citizens' civil liberties 公民自由 from state intrusion 州政府的干涉, not federal intrusion 联邦政府的干涉. +

Okay, let's talk about the constitutional right to privacy. And already you're like: "I don't remember that being in the Bill of Rights." And you would be absolutely correct. Nowhere does it say in the first ten amendments to the Constitution that Americans have the right to privacy. Right to the free exercise of religion 宗教信仰自由? Yes. Right to a speedy trial 迅速审判的权利? Yes. Right to privacy? What you talking about with us? It's true, there is no such right explicitly 明确地 mentioned in the Bill of Rights. However, in the course of 在…过程中 several Supreme Court cases, the court established the right to privacy as an implicit right 隐含权利 based on the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. +

So let me explain. In 1925, a case called Pierce v. Society of Sisters was decided. This is a non-required case but it's important nonetheless 尽管如此. It was a case about Oregon's compulsory education law 义务教育法, which meant that parents had to send their children to a public school in their district. A couple of Catholic parochial schools 天主教教区学校 saw their attendance dwindle 减少 as a result of that law, and said that such a law was unconstitutional 违宪的 because it took decisions about education out of the hands of parents. The court agreed with the parochial schools, and in his majority opinion 多数意见, Justice McReynolds said this: "The child is not the mere creature of the state. Those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations." So this case is important because in general, many scholars argue that it was this decision that set the stage for 为…奠定基础 the court's interpretation 解释 for the right to privacy. +

However, it was 40 years later in a case called Griswold v. Connecticut that the right to privacy was clearly established by the court. In that case, the court ruled that a married couple could not be denied contraceptive medication 避孕药物. In other words, the government could not infringe upon 侵犯 a married couple's right to privacy in making decisions about their health. And it was Justice William Douglas who authored 撰写 the majority opinion, and in it he said these famous words: "The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras" -- which means shadows 阴影 -- "formed by emanations 衍生 from those guarantees that help give them life and sustenance 支持. Various guarantees create zones of privacy 隐私区域." +

So Douglas uses the metaphor of 隐喻 light and shadow to explain how the Bill of Rights works. There are rights explicitly stated, and those are clear because the light is cast on them and they are plain for all to see. But those rights also cast shadows, and those shadows are zones of privacy that correspond to 与…相对应 the enumerated right 列举的权利 mentioned specifically. Now I understand it's a little confusing, so let me just give you an example. So the First Amendment 第一修正案 protects a person's right to the freedom of speech 言论自由, and in a previous case the court determined that this right extended to what a person possesses and chooses to read. So when a Georgia man was arrested in the late 60s for possessing pornographic material 色情材料 in his home -- which was illegal in those days -- the case came before the Supreme Court, and in a unanimous opinion 一致意见, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote this: "If the First Amendment means anything, it means that the state has no business telling a man sitting alone in his own house what books he may read or what films he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds." +

Okay, so the right to privacy, even as a shadow of other constitutional liberties, had been well established by that point. And that brings us to the most controversial 有争议的 of all right to privacy cases, namely Roe v. Wade in 1972. Now as with all your required cases, I have a whole video diving into 深入探讨 the details of this case, so here I'm just going to give you the basics. When a woman identified as Jane Roe could not obtain an abortion 堕胎 under restrictive Texas law 限制性的德克萨斯州法律, she appealed to the Supreme Court 向最高法院上诉 arguing that her rights had been infringed upon 侵犯. The court agreed and ended up overturning 推翻 abortion laws throughout the United States. And in the majority opinion, the justices argued like this: "A state may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health 维护健康, maintaining medical standards 维持医疗标准, and in protecting potential life 潜在生命. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling 有说服力的 to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. We therefore conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified 绝对的 and must be considered against important state interests in regulation." +

Now there are two things to notice here. First is that a woman's right to abortion is based on her constitutional right to privacy, and in the decision both the Pierce and Griswold cases were called upon for precedent 先例. However, as with every other liberty protected in the Bill of Rights, this right is not absolute 绝对的. At some point -- and the court calls this point viability 可存活状态 -- a pregnant woman, according to the court, has an actual human being in her belly, and at that point the woman's right to privacy may in fact be tempered by 受到…的限制 the state's interest in upholding the life of the child. For the court, that meant that before the age of viability -- which is to say the first trimester 怀孕的前三个月 -- states could not in any way restrict abortion. In the second trimester, states could make restrictions as long as they were related to the mother's health. And by the third trimester, states could prohibit abortions entirely unless the mother's health and life were at stake 处于危险中. +

Okay, thanks for watching. Click right here to grab a review packet which is going to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. And since you have a well-established 已确立的 right to privacy, I will in no way tell you what to do, but if you want me to keep making these videos, then you can let me know that by subscribing 订阅 and I shall oblige 照办.

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第三单元，在这个视频中，我们要讨论宪法所赋予的隐私权。所以，如果你准备好潜移默化地汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释各州在正当程序条款的限制下，对侵犯个人权利的行为受到了怎样的限制。在这个学习目标中，关键的词是 “各州”—— 各州在侵犯个人权利方面受到怎样的限制呢？记住，我们一直在讨论选择性合并的过程，这是最高法院将《权利法案》的保护措施应用于各州的方式。他们能够这样做是因为第十四修正案中的平等保护条款，该条款规定：“任何州都不得制定或执行任何会剥夺美国公民的特权或豁免权的法律，也不得拒绝给予其管辖范围内的任何人以法律的平等保护。” 所以这个修正案要求保护公民的民事自由不受州政府的侵犯，而不是联邦政府的侵犯。 +

好的，我们来谈谈宪法所赋予的隐私权。你可能会想：“我不记得《权利法案》中有提到这个。” 你这样想完全正确。在美国宪法的前十条修正案中，确实没有提到美国人享有隐私权。享有自由践行宗教的权利吗？有。享有迅速审判的权利吗？有。隐私权呢？你在说什么呢？确实，《权利法案》中没有明确提到这项权利。然而，在一些最高法院的案件中，法院根据第一、第四、第五、第九和第十四修正案，将隐私权确立为一项隐含的权利。 +

我来解释一下。1925年，“皮尔斯诉姐妹会案”（Pierce v. Society of Sisters）做出了裁决。这是一个非必学的案件，但它仍然很重要。这个案件是关于俄勒冈州的义务教育法，该法律要求父母必须把孩子送到所在地区的公立学校。一些天主教教区学校因为这项法律导致入学人数减少，他们称这项法律违宪，因为它剥夺了父母在教育方面的决定权。法院支持了教区学校的观点，麦克雷诺兹（McReynolds）大法官在多数意见中表示：“孩子不只是国家的产物。养育孩子并指引其命运的人有权利，同时也肩负着重大责任，去认知并让孩子为承担更多义务做好准备。” 所以这个案件很重要，因为总体而言，许多学者认为，正是这项裁决为法院对隐私权的解释奠定了基础。 +

然而，40年后的 “格里斯沃尔德诉康涅狄格州案”（Griswold v. Connecticut）中，法院明确确立了隐私权。在这个案件中，法院裁定，不能剥夺已婚夫妇使用避孕药物的权利。换句话说，政府不能侵犯已婚夫妇在健康决策方面的隐私权。威廉·道格拉斯（William Douglas）大法官撰写了多数意见，他在意见中说了这句名言：“前面提到的案件表明，《权利法案》中的特定保障条款有 ‘半影’（即阴影），这些 ‘半影’ 是由这些保障条款衍生出来的，它们赋予这些条款以生命力和支持。各种保障条款创造了隐私区域。” +

所以道格拉斯用光明与阴影的隐喻来解释《权利法案》的运作方式。有些权利是明确规定的，这些权利很清晰，因为它们被光照亮，所有人都能清楚看到。但这些权利也会产生阴影，这些阴影就是与明确提及的权利相对应的隐私区域。我知道这有点令人困惑，所以我举个例子。第一修正案保护个人的言论自由权，在之前的一个案件中，法院判定这项权利延伸到个人拥有和选择阅读的内容。所以当一个佐治亚州的男子在60年代后期因在家中持有色情材料（在当时这是违法的）而被捕时，这个案件被提交到最高法院，瑟古德·马歇尔（Thurgood Marshall）大法官在一致意见中写道：“如果第一修正案有任何意义的话，那就是国家无权告诉一个独自坐在自己家中的人他可以读什么书或者看什么电影。我们整个宪法传统都反对给予政府控制人们思想的权力。” +

好的，所以隐私权，即使作为其他宪法自由的 “半影”，在那时已经得到了很好的确立。这就引出了所有隐私权案件中最具争议的一个，即1972年的 “罗诉韦德案”（Roe v. Wade）。和所有你需要学习的案件一样，我有一个完整的视频深入探讨这个案件的细节，所以在这里我只讲一些基本情况。当一个化名简·罗（Jane Roe）的女性因得克萨斯州的限制性法律而无法堕胎时，她向最高法院上诉，称她的权利受到了侵犯。法院同意了她的观点，最终推翻了美国各地的堕胎法律。在多数意见中，大法官们这样认为：“一个州可以合理地主张在保护健康、维持医疗标准以及保护潜在生命方面的重要利益。在怀孕的某个阶段，这些各自的利益强大到足以支持对决定堕胎的相关因素进行监管。因此，我们得出结论，个人隐私权包括堕胎的决定，但这项权利不是绝对的，必须结合州在监管方面的重要利益来考虑。” +

这里有两点需要注意。第一，女性的堕胎权是基于她的宪法隐私权，在这个裁决中，“皮尔斯案” 和 “格里斯沃尔德案” 被作为先例引用。然而，和《权利法案》中保护的其他自由一样，这项权利不是绝对的。在某个阶段—— 法院称这个阶段为 “可存活阶段”—— 按照法院的说法，孕妇腹中是一个真实的人，在那个阶段，女性的隐私权实际上可能会因州在维护胎儿生命方面的利益而受到限制。对于法院来说，这意味着在可存活年龄（也就是怀孕的前三个月）之前，各州不得以任何方式限制堕胎。在怀孕的第二个三个月，各州可以制定与孕妇健康相关的限制措施。而在怀孕的第三个三个月，各州可以完全禁止堕胎，除非孕妇的健康和生命受到威胁。 +

所以我可能不用告诉你，这个案件在美国公民中引发了轩然大波，并且直到今天它仍然使我们产生分歧。即便如此，通过这个案件以及之前的所有案件，公民的隐私权作为《权利法案》中明确提及的自由的 “半影”，已经得到了很好的确立。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取复习资料包，它将帮助你在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分。而且既然你拥有确立的隐私权，我绝不会告诉你该怎么做，但如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那就订阅来告诉我，我会照做的。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +

Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 3 of the AP Government curriculum, and in this video it's time to talk about the constitutional right to privacy. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked implicitly, then let's get to it.

And so I probably don't have to tell you that this case created a firestorm among American citizens, and it still divides us to this day. Even so, with this case and all the cases that came before it, a citizen's right to privacy as the penumbra of the explicitly mentioned liberties in the Bill of Rights has been well established.
