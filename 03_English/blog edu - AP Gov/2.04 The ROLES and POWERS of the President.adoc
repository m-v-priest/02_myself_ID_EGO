Here's the transformed version with vocabulary annotations and segment markers:

well hey there and welcome back to heimler's history. in this video we're going to continue working through unit 2 第二单元 of the AP Government curriculum 课程大纲, and that means in this video it's time to talk about the roles and powers of everybody's favorite politician 政治家: the president of the United States, the podus with the modus. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milked 榨取脑力, well then let's get to it.




okay, here's what we're trying to do in this video: explain how the president can implement 实施 a policy agenda 政策议程. so first, what is a policy agenda? well every president has certain policies that he or she campaigns on 竞选承诺, and this is a kind of informal contract 非正式契约 between the candidate 候选人 and the people who vote the president in. when the president outlines 概述 a policy agenda, just saying like "if you elect me, here are the laws that I will work to put into place." but wait just a dang second, we're far enough along into this curriculum by now for you to know that according to the Constitution 宪法, the president has precisely no authority 权力 to pass laws. that is the job of Congress 国会.




so without any constitutional power to pass laws, how does the president get a policy agenda passed into law? well the president does that by means of formal powers 正式权力 and informal powers 非正式权力, and I reckon 认为 we ought to talk about both. the formal powers of the president are those explicitly 明确地 given to the executive 行政部门 in Article 2 of The Constitution. the first formal power you should know is the veto 否决权, and in case it helps you to remember it, the veto is an old Latin word that means "I forbid" -- just like when my six-year-old asked to play with my Luke Skywalker Legacy lightsaber. veto. "but Dad, why can't I play with your toys?" "it's not a toy, it's a collectible." veto. anyway, the president has the power to veto any bill 法案 that comes across the presidential desk, and if that happens, the bill will not become a law unless of course Congress overrides 推翻 that veto with a 2/3 vote. and once the bill arrives from Congress on the president's desk, the president has 10 days to sign it into law.




now how does the president decide which bill is to sign and which to veto? well the answer is a lot more complicated than what I'm about to say, but for our purposes you just need to know that the president will veto a law if it is not in line with 符合 the presidential policy agenda. now usually the veto is not a surprise to anyone -- the president knows what kind of legislation 立法 is being worked on in Congress, and Congress wants to avoid that veto at all cost 不惜一切代价 because if legislation is vetoed, it starts right back over in Congress. so in many cases, all the president has to do is threaten to veto a bill, and that motivates congressional representatives 国会代表 to try to fashion 制定 the bill into something that the president will sign.




okay, so a veto is an executive power given to the president by the Constitution, but there's a sneakier way to veto a bill, and that is called a pocket veto 搁置否决权. remember I told you that the president has 10 days to sign a bill? well if Congress adjourns 休会 before that 10-day period is up and the president just doesn't sign the bill, it's effectively vetoed.




now another formal power given to the president by the Constitution has to do with foreign policy 外交政策, namely the president is the commander-in-chief 总司令 of the United States Armed Forces 武装部队. now even though the president is the leader of the Armed Forces, don't forget that it's Congress who has the power to declare war 宣战 according to Article 1 Section 8. even so, the president can use this formal power to implement the presidential policy agenda. for example, Joe Biden campaigned on the promise to end the war in Afghanistan and remove all American troops 军队, and as the commander-in-chief he has the authority to do that, and he has done that. now I was turning into kind of a mess, but that's not the point of this video -- the point is that was part of Biden's policy agenda, and he used his formal powers to get it done.




okay, so those are two of the formal powers of the president that you should know. now let's consider the informal powers by which the presidential policy agenda is enacted 制定. informal powers are not mentioned in the Constitution, but they exist because of the nature of executive power. the first example is bargaining and persuasion 谈判与说服, and we'll talk more about this in another video, but here you should just know that the president has the ear of the nation 获得全国关注 in a way that no other politician does, and as such, the president can talk to the people and try to persuade them to put pressure on their representatives to pass legislation in line with the presidential policy agenda. but the president can also bargain with Congress to get favorable legislation passed. usually the president's ability to bargain is directly correlated with 与...直接相关 the presidential approval ratings 支持率. for example, in Lyndon Johnson's first term, he had something like an 80% approval rating which gave him a lot of leverage 影响力 to get Congress to pass his Great Society legislation. but a few decades later when President Clinton was trying to get Healthcare legislation passed, his 40% approval rating meant that Congress really didn't need to listen to him, and spoiler alert 剧透警告, they didn't.




another informal power of the president is the executive order 行政命令. this is a directive 指令 from the president that has the force of federal law but is not actually a law, and that could be very confusing at first, so let me explain it up real nice for you. as the executive, the president is the head of the entire bureaucracy 官僚体系 of the executive department, so this would include the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Department of Education, and so on. all these departments answer directly to the president, although they do depend on Congress for their funding 资金. additionally, remember that the executive branch exists to execute 执行 the laws passed by Congress, so an executive order is a way for the president to direct the bureaucracy or move money around or whatever to accomplish his or her policy agenda. let me give you an example: Donald Trump was unable to persuade Congress to pass legislation to build a wall on the US-Mexican border, and so he rerouted funds 转移资金 by executive order between his executive departments to get it done. and probably the most famous example of an executive order was Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation 解放宣言 which freed all enslaved people in the Confederacy. as the president, Lincoln had no power to make these enslaved people into citizens -- that would have to wait for the 13th Amendment -- but he did this as a military strategy 军事策略 in concert with 与...一致 his formal powers as the commander-in-chief.




another informal power you should know is the signing statement 签署声明. when signing a bill into law, the president can offer a signing statement that informs the nation how the president interprets that law and thus how he or she intends to execute it. needless to say, the presidential interpretation of the law in this case will often be different from the congressional intent 国会意图 of the law. for example, President Franklin Roosevelt issued a signing statement when signing a law during World War II. he mentioned that he disagreed with one of the sections -- he thought it was unconstitutional 违宪的 -- but he had no choice but to sign the law since a veto would delay US efforts on the warfront. and so in his signing statement he said that if the law came before the courts, his lawyers would attack the section, not uphold it, and that's exactly what happened, and the Court ruled that the section was unconstitutional.




okay, the last informal power you should know is the power of executive agreements 行政协议. and these are just agreements between the president and some other head of state 国家元首, and it's not some formal treaty 条约 which constitutionally would require Senate approval. rather, it's an agreement that the president makes on the president's own authority. for example, I mentioned in another video how President Obama entered the Paris Accord on climate change by means of executive agreement and not by treaty, which was an impossibility since the Senate was against this move. but executive agreements only exist as long as that president is in power, which is why Donald Trump put the kabash 终止 on America's involvement in that agreement, and then Joe Biden went right ahead and got us back in. so what you really need to understand is that executive agreements are more politically binding 政治约束力 than legally binding 法律约束力. •

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。在这个视频中，我们将继续学习美国大学预修课程政府学的第二单元，这意味着在这个视频里，我们要谈谈大家都喜欢的政治家的角色和权力：美国总统（the president of the United States），那位手握权力的人。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

好的，在这个视频中我们要做的是：解释总统如何实施一项政策议程。那么首先，什么是政策议程呢？嗯，每位总统都有一些他或她在竞选时所倡导的政策，这是候选人与投票让总统当选的民众之间的一种非正式契约。当总统概述一项政策议程时，就好比说 “如果你选我，这些就是我将努力实施的法律” 。但是等一下，在这个课程中我们已经学到了足够多的内容，你应该知道根据宪法，总统精确来说并没有权力通过法律。那是国会的工作。 +

那么，在没有任何宪法赋予的权力来通过法律的情况下，总统如何让一项政策议程成为法律呢？嗯，总统通过正式权力和非正式权力来做到这一点，我认为我们应该谈谈这两种权力。总统的正式权力是宪法第二条明确赋予行政部门的权力。你需要知道的第一项正式权力是否决权（veto），为了帮助你记住它，“veto” 是一个古老的拉丁语单词，意思是 “我禁止”——就像我六岁的孩子要求玩我的卢克·天行者（Luke Skywalker）传承光剑时，我说的 “veto” 一样。“但是爸爸，为什么我不能玩你的玩具呢？” “这不是玩具，这是收藏品。” 否决。不管怎样，总统有权否决提交到总统办公桌上的任何法案，而且如果总统行使否决权，除非国会以三分之二的票数推翻否决，否则该法案就不能成为法律。并且一旦法案从国会提交到总统办公桌上，总统有10天时间签署使其成为法律。 +

那么总统如何决定签署哪项法案，否决哪项法案呢？嗯，答案比我接下来要说的要复杂得多，但就我们的目的而言，你只需要知道如果一项法案不符合总统的政策议程，总统就会否决它。通常情况下，否决权对任何人来说都不意外——总统知道国会正在处理什么样的立法，而且国会会不惜一切代价避免法案被否决，因为如果一项立法被否决，它就得在国会重新开始审议。所以在很多情况下，总统所要做的就是威胁要否决一项法案，这会促使国会议员努力让法案成为总统会签署的样子。 +

好的，否决权是宪法赋予总统的一项行政权力，但还有一种更隐蔽的否决法案的方式，那就是所谓的搁置否决权（pocket veto）。还记得我告诉过你总统有10天时间签署一项法案吗？嗯，如果国会在这10天期限结束前休会，而总统没有签署法案，那么该法案实际上就被否决了。 +

现在，宪法赋予总统的另一项正式权力与外交政策有关，即总统是美国武装部队总司令（the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces）。现在，尽管总统是武装部队的领导人，但不要忘记根据宪法第一条第八款，宣战的权力属于国会。即便如此，总统可以利用这项正式权力来实施总统的政策议程。例如，乔·拜登（Joe Biden）在竞选时承诺结束阿富汗战争并撤出所有美军，作为总司令，他有权这样做，而且他也确实这样做了。现在我说的有点跑题了，但这不是这个视频的重点——重点是这是拜登政策议程的一部分，而且他利用他的正式权力做到了这一点。 +

好的，这些是你需要知道的总统的两项正式权力。现在让我们考虑一下总统用来制定政策议程的非正式权力。非正式权力在宪法中没有提及，但它们的存在是由行政权力的性质决定的。第一个例子是讨价还价和说服的权力，我们将在另一个视频中更多地讨论这个问题，但在这里你只需要知道总统以一种其他政治家没有的方式能够引起全国民众的关注，因此，总统可以与民众交流，并试图说服他们向他们的代表施压，以通过符合总统政策议程的立法。但总统也可以与国会讨价还价，以通过有利的立法。通常总统的讨价还价能力与总统的支持率直接相关。例如，林登·约翰逊（Lyndon Johnson）在他的第一个任期内，支持率达到了大约80%，这使他有很大的影响力让国会通过他的 “伟大社会” 立法。但几十年后，当比尔·克林顿（Bill Clinton）总统试图通过医疗保健立法时，他40%的支持率意味着国会真的不需要听他的，剧透一下，他们确实没有听。 +

总统的另一项非正式权力是行政命令（executive order）。这是总统发出的一项指令，它具有联邦法律的效力，但实际上并不是法律，这一开始可能会让人感到困惑，所以让我好好给你解释一下。作为行政首脑，总统是整个行政部门官僚机构的负责人，所以这包括农业部（the Department of Agriculture）、国防部（the Department of Defense）、教育部（the Department of Education）等等。所有这些部门都直接向总统负责，尽管它们的资金依赖于国会。另外，要记住行政部门的存在是为了执行国会通过的法律，所以行政命令是总统指挥官僚机构、调配资金或采取其他行动以实现其政策议程的一种方式。让我给你举个例子：唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）无法说服国会通过在美墨边境修建隔离墙的立法，所以他通过行政命令在他的各行政部门之间重新调配资金来完成这件事。最著名的行政命令的例子可能是亚伯拉罕·林肯（Abraham Lincoln）的《解放黑人奴隶宣言》（Emancipation Proclamation），它解放了邦联中的所有奴隶。作为总统，林肯没有权力让这些奴隶成为公民——这得等到宪法第十三修正案的通过——但他这样做是作为一种军事策略，结合了他作为总司令的正式权力。 +

你需要知道的另一项非正式权力是签署声明（signing statement）。当总统签署一项法案使其成为法律时，总统可以发表签署声明，告知全国总统对该法律的解释，以及他或她打算如何执行该法律。不用说，总统对法律的解释在这种情况下往往与国会制定该法律的意图不同。例如，富兰克林·罗斯福（Franklin Roosevelt）总统在二战期间签署一项法律时发表了签署声明。他提到他不同意其中一个条款——他认为该条款违宪——但他别无选择只能签署该法律，因为否决该法律会延误美国在战争方面的努力。所以在他的签署声明中，他表示如果该法律提交到法院，他的律师会抨击该条款，而不是支持它，而实际情况也正是如此，法院裁定该条款违宪。 +

好的，你需要知道的最后一项非正式权力是行政协定（executive agreements）的权力。这些是总统与其他国家元首之间的协定，而且它不是那种从宪法上来说需要参议院批准的正式条约。相反，这是总统凭借自身权力达成的协定。例如，我在另一个视频中提到过，巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）总统通过行政协定加入了《巴黎气候协定》（Paris Accord），而不是通过条约，因为参议院反对这一举措，所以通过条约加入是不可能的。但行政协定只在总统任职期间有效，这就是为什么唐纳德·特朗普终止了美国对该协定的参与，然后乔·拜登又让美国重新加入了该协定。所以你真正需要理解的是，行政协定在政治上的约束力大于法律上的约束力。 +
