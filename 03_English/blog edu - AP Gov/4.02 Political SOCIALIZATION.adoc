Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now I've been going through Unit 4 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video that means it's time to talk about political socialization 政治社会化. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with them, let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how cultural factors 文化因素 influence political attitudes 政治态度 and socialization 社会化. So the real question here is, how is it that you and I come to believe in one political ideology 政治意识形态 or another? And as much as I'd like to tell you that all Americans form their political beliefs by spending hundreds of hours pouring over 仔细研读 complex works of political science 政治学著作 and delving into 深入研究 the depths of various primary documents 原始文献 of our national and constitutional origins 国家和宪法起源 -- now there are a few people who do that -- but in general, most of us form our political opinions 政治观点 based on humbler factors 更平常的因素. And the process by which we form our political opinions is called political socialization. +

So let's talk about the six factors that work together in our political socialization. First and foremost 首先 is the family. And many studies have borne out 证实 the truth that children will often hold the same or similar political opinions held by their parents. For example, it probably won't surprise you to know that politics is often a discussion around the Heimler dinner table, and my children pick these things up 学到这些 maybe without even knowing it. So if you asked my six - year - old son which political party 政党 deserves our vote, then you would no doubt hear this: "Uh, that's complicated." Yes, that is the right answer, my son. I'm raising him right. +

In fact, in 2002, Christopher Aiken published a study demonstrating that while experienced adult voters 有经验的成年选民 considered a variety of factors when it came to how they voted, younger voters casting their ballots 投票 for the first time almost always relied on the political ideology they picked up from their parents. I should say that since the advent of 出现 social media 社交媒体, this connection has shown some signs of weakening 减弱迹象, but even so, the family remains the biggest early influence on people's political ideology 政治意识形态. +

Okay, the second factor in political socialization is schools. And though there is no wealth of evidence 大量证据 that suggests that students become more conservative 保守的 or more liberal 自由的 as a result of being in a K - 12 class, it does have the potential to shape 塑造 how a student thinks about politics and therefore the world. There's some classes like AP Government or civics class 公民课 that directly shape how a student thinks about politics, but again back to the point I just made -- these classes usually don't make a student more conservative or more liberal even with direct exposure to these modes of thought 思想模式. +

But there are also other factors in school that, while not directly engaging students in political socialization, do influence their political beliefs nonetheless 尽管如此. In this day and age 如今, it is the history classroom that has created a political firestorm 政治风暴. For example, in 2019, the New York Times released something called the 1619 Project, which was a series of resources 一系列资料 that argued the following: every American institution 机构 is tainted with 沾染 racism 种族主义 because everything was built -- whether politically, economically, or socially -- on the institution of slavery 奴隶制. And some teachers used this material in their history classes. +

Well, as you probably know, such an interpretation of U.S. history is politically contentious 有争议的 to say the least 至少可以说. Such a perspective 观点 grows out of a liberal liberationist mindset 自由解放主义思维模式 which seeks to challenge the dominant historical narrative 主流历史叙事 and uplift 提升 the voices and actions of those who have been historically oppressed 历史上受压迫的人. You can imagine that as a student, if you were taught this, it would have an influence on your political ideology 政治意识形态. +

Well, in response to this, conservatives formed the 1776 Commission 1776委员会 and produced resources that explained U.S. history through a different lens 视角. U.S. history was not something to be ashamed of 感到羞愧的, they argued, but rather something to be proud of 感到自豪的. Yes, Americans have had their blemishes 瑕疵, but ultimately American history is filled with progress 进步 and the advancement 发展 toward ever more freedom and democracy 自由与民主. And by contrast 相比之下, you can see that if this was the version of history you were taught, it would have an influence on your political ideology in the opposite direction 相反方向. So schools, both in direct and indirect ways, influence our political socialization 政治社会化. +

The third factor in our political socialization is our interaction with peers 同龄人. Social conformity 社会从众心理 plays a huge role in what a person believes. Like if your peers all hold to 坚持 political ideology X and you hold the political ideology Y, there is a huge amount of social pressure -- even if it's not direct -- to conform your beliefs to the peer group 使自己的信仰与同龄人一致. +

A fourth factor in our political socialization is the media 媒体. Spending so much time in front of screens 屏幕 has given people of all ages -- but especially young people -- more access to 接触到 a wide range of viewpoints 广泛的观点. Almost daily we see people saying things in the public square 公共领域 that shapes the way we think about politics, and we also see people getting cancelled 被抵制 for offensive statements 冒犯性言论, and that can have a way of convincing us that we don't want to be on the other side of that cancelling, and so we adjust our beliefs and language accordingly 相应地调整我们的信仰和言论. +

Additionally, with the rise in the last 20 years of cable news 有线电视新闻, we've seen a tremendous increase in conservative and liberal pundits 评论员 who tell us with authority 权威地 exactly how we should think about everything that happens. Look, as long as I have any platform to stand on, I will always warn anyone who listens to me to be very wary of 对…持谨慎态度 those pundits. They are first and foremost 首先 entertainers 表演者, and they care very little about presenting the world and all its complexity as it actually is 如实呈现世界及其复杂性. Nevertheless 然而, much to my chagrin 令我懊恼的是, they have very large audiences and they are able to shape the way people think about politics 塑造人们对政治的看法. +

A fifth factor in political socialization is our participation in civic and religious organizations 公民和宗教组织. An example of a civic organization 公民组织 would be the Boy Scouts 童子军 or the Girl Scouts. The Boy Scouts organization was founded with the explicit mention 明确提及 to teach boys patriotism 爱国主义, courage 勇气, self - reliance 自力更生, and kindred values 类似的价值观. Now since 1910 when that was written, the Scout's commitment to patriotism has undergone some change 经历了一些变化, but nevertheless if you're a Scout, it will affect the way you think about -- to use their own language -- God and country. In other words, political socialization is happening in a civic organization like that 这样的公民组织中发生着政治社会化. +

An example of a religious organization 宗教组织 would be membership and attendance in a church or a synagogue 犹太教堂 or a mosque 清真寺. Now all religious organizations vary in terms of their political beliefs 政治信仰不同 -- you've got liberal churches and conservative churches, liberal synagogues and conservative synagogues, liberal mosques and conservative mosques -- but the point is, whatever political ideology is joined to 与…相关联 the organization's religious belief is the political ideology the congregation 会众 will be hearing about week after week, and that has an influence 产生影响. +

For example, evangelical Christian churches 福音派基督教会 saw a significant shuffling of members 成员大幅变动 during the COVID - 19 pandemic. Some churches, when they reopened, required masks in order to participate in worship 参加礼拜, and that offense 冒犯行为 was all it took for many members to reject what they thought of as overt liberal political socialization 明显的自由派政治社会化 and choose another church that aligned more with their political beliefs 与他们的政治信仰更一致. +

And the sixth factor in political socialization is globalization 全球化. By definition 从定义上讲, globalization is the increasing interconnectedness 日益紧密的联系 of the world by means of 通过 economic partnerships 经济合作. Let me hasten to add 赶紧补充说 that is a very basic definition, but it'll do for our purposes 满足我们的需求. However, along with those economic connections come political influences as well 随之而来的还有政治影响. Like in a globalized world, we are all influenced by factors well beyond our borders 远超国界的因素. +

For example, through immigration 移民, people bring their cultural ideas to bear on 对…产生影响 the political culture of the United States. Immigrants from Asian countries have a much stronger sense of the good of the community above the individual 集体利益高于个人利益, and as they immigrate to America, that value can run counter to 与…相悖 our strong belief in the triumph of the individual 个人至上. Even so, in some cases, such a belief might take root 扎根 and affect a person's political socialization 政治社会化. +

Okay, thanks for watching. Click right here to grab your packet if you want help getting an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. If this video helped you and you want me to keep making them, then lean on 依靠 your YouTube socialization and subscribe, and that will let me know that you want me to keep making them. Heimler out. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第四单元，在这个视频中，意味着是时候讨论政治社会化了。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释文化因素如何影响政治态度和政治社会化。所以这里真正的问题是，你和我是如何开始相信某种政治意识形态的呢？虽然我很想说所有美国人都是通过花费数百个小时研读复杂的政治学著作，深入探究我们国家和宪法起源的各种原始文献来形成他们的政治信仰的——确实有一些人是这样做的——但总的来说，我们大多数人是基于一些更平常的因素来形成我们的政治观点的。我们形成政治观点的这个过程就叫做政治社会化。 +

所以，让我们谈谈在我们的政治社会化过程中共同起作用的六个因素。首先是家庭。许多研究都证实了这样一个事实，即孩子们往往会持有与他们父母相同或相似的政治观点。例如，如果你知道在海姆勒家的餐桌上经常讨论政治，而我的孩子们在不知不觉中就接受了这些观点，你可能不会感到惊讶。所以，如果你问我六岁的儿子应该投票给哪个政党，你无疑会听到他说：“呃，这很复杂。” 是的，这是正确答案，我的儿子，我把他教育得很好。 +

事实上，在2002年，克里斯托弗·艾肯（Christopher Aiken）发表了一项研究，表明虽然有经验的成年选民在投票时会考虑各种因素，但首次投票的年轻选民几乎总是依赖于他们从父母那里学到的政治意识形态。我应该说，自从社交媒体出现以来，这种联系已经显示出一些减弱的迹象，但即便如此，家庭仍然是对人们的政治意识形态早期影响最大的因素。 +

好的，政治社会化的第二个因素是学校。虽然没有大量证据表明学生因为上了从幼儿园到十二年级（K-12）的课程而变得更加保守或更加自由，但学校确实有潜力塑造学生对政治的看法，进而影响他们对世界的看法。有一些课程，比如美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课或公民课，会直接塑造学生对政治的看法，但我刚才提到的观点依然成立——即使直接接触这些思维方式，这些课程通常也不会让学生变得更加保守或更加自由。 +

但是学校里还有其他一些因素，虽然不会直接让学生参与政治社会化，但确实会影响他们的政治信仰。在当今时代，历史课堂引发了一场政治风暴。例如，2019年，《纽约时报》（The New York Times）发布了一个名为 “1619项目” 的内容，这是一系列资料，其观点如下：美国的每一个机构都受到了种族主义的玷污，因为一切——无论是在政治、经济还是社会方面——都是建立在奴隶制制度之上的。一些教师在他们的历史课上使用了这些材料。 +

嗯，你可能知道，至少可以说，对美国历史的这种解读在政治上是有争议的。这种观点源于一种自由解放主义的思维方式，它试图挑战占主导地位的历史叙事，并提升那些在历史上受到压迫的人的声音和行动。你可以想象，作为一名学生，如果你被教授了这些内容，它会对你的政治意识形态产生影响。 +

作为对此的回应，保守派成立了 “1776委员会”，并制作了一些资料，从不同的角度解释美国历史。他们认为，美国历史不是应该感到羞耻的东西，而是值得骄傲的。是的，美国人有他们的污点，但最终美国历史充满了进步，朝着更加自由和民主的方向发展。相比之下，你可以看到，如果你被教授的是这种版本的历史，它会以相反的方向影响你的政治意识形态。所以，学校以直接和间接的方式影响着我们的政治社会化。 +

我们政治社会化的第三个因素是我们与同龄人的互动。社会从众心理在一个人的信仰中起着巨大的作用。比如，如果你的同龄人都持有政治意识形态X，而你持有政治意识形态Y，就会有巨大的社会压力——即使这种压力不是直接的——让你使自己的信仰与同龄人群体保持一致。 +

我们政治社会化的第四个因素是媒体。花大量时间在屏幕前让各个年龄段的人——尤其是年轻人——能够接触到各种各样的观点。几乎每天我们都会看到人们在公共场合发表言论，这些言论塑造了我们对政治的看法，我们也看到人们因为发表冒犯性言论而被抵制，这可能会让我们相信我们不想处于被抵制的那一方，所以我们相应地调整自己的信仰和言论。 +

此外，在过去20年里，随着有线电视新闻的兴起，我们看到保守派和自由派的专家数量大幅增加，他们权威地告诉我们应该如何看待发生的一切。听着，只要我有平台发表意见，我都会警告任何听我讲话的人要非常警惕这些专家。他们首先是艺人，他们不太在意以真实的方式呈现这个世界及其所有的复杂性。然而，让我懊恼的是，他们有非常庞大的观众群体，并且能够塑造人们对政治的看法。 +

政治社会化的第五个因素是我们对公民和宗教组织的参与。公民组织的一个例子是童子军（Boy Scouts）或女童子军（Girl Scouts）。童子军组织成立时明确提到要教导男孩爱国主义、勇气、自力更生和类似的价值观。自1910年写下这些内容以来，童子军对爱国主义的承诺经历了一些变化，但即便如此，如果你是童子军，用他们自己的话说，这会影响你对上帝和国家的看法。换句话说，在这样的公民组织中，政治社会化正在发生。 +

宗教组织的一个例子是加入并参加教堂、犹太教堂或清真寺的活动。所有宗教组织在其政治信仰方面各不相同——有自由派教堂和保守派教堂，自由派犹太教堂和保守派犹太教堂，自由派清真寺和保守派清真寺——但关键是，与组织的宗教信仰相关联的任何政治意识形态，教众每周都会听到，这会产生影响。 +

例如，在新冠疫情期间，福音派基督教堂的成员发生了重大变动。一些教堂在重新开放时，要求参加礼拜时戴口罩，就是这一点冒犯了许多成员，他们认为这是明显的自由派政治社会化，于是选择了另一个与他们的政治信仰更一致的教堂。 +

政治社会化的第六个因素是全球化。从定义上讲，全球化是指通过经济合作使世界的相互联系日益紧密。我赶紧补充一下，这只是一个非常基本的定义，但对我们的目的来说已经足够了。然而，随着这些经济联系而来的还有政治影响。例如，通过移民，人们将他们的文化观念带入了美国的政治文化中。来自亚洲国家的移民有一种更强烈的集体利益高于个人利益的意识，当他们移民到美国时，这种价值观可能与我们对个人胜利的强烈信念相悖。即便如此，在某些情况下，这种信念可能会扎根并影响一个人的政治社会化。 +

好的，感谢观看。如果你想在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分，点击这里获取资料包。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那就依靠你的YouTube社交功能订阅吧，这会让我知道你希望我继续制作。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +
