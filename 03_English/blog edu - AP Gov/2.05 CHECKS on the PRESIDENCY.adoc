Hey there and welcome back to Heimlich's History. Now we've been going through unit 2 of the AP government curriculum 课程，and in this video we're going to continue talking about presidential 总统的 power, but here we're going to talk about the limits 限制 of that power. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how the president's agenda 议程 can create tension 紧张关系 and frequent 频繁的 confrontations 对抗；冲突 with congress. All right, I hope you can taste the sauce already because this is about to get spicy. +

So the main beef 矛盾；争执 here is usually between the president and the senate, and that's because constitutionally 按照宪法地 the senate is given the power of advice and consent （美）咨询和同意权. In addition to giving the senate the power to approve 批准；赞成 treaties 条约, the power of advice and consent means that many presidential appointments 任命 have to first be approved by the senate. So let's have a look at those appointments, and we'll take it from the least beefy to the most beefy. +

First, the president has the power to appoint ambassadors 大使 to other nations. These are US diplomats 外交官 who are assigned 分配；指派 to various foreign countries who organize the U.S. presence there and nurture 培育；促进 the relationship between the U.S. and that foreign nation. When the president appoints an ambassador, the senate usually just rubber-stamps 不假思索地批准 the thing and sends the ambassador on his or her way. +

So let's move to the next kind of appointment, namely the white house staff 工作人员. And these folks need no approval by the senate. The president appoints all kinds of staffers to work in the executive 行政的 offices, and they're usually people who ran the president's campaign 竞选活动 or are friendly with the president. +

Okay, now is where things start heating up. The president is also responsible for appointing members of the presidential cabinet 内阁, which represents the heads of all the main executive departments 部门. These positions are very much up for senate approval, and they are usually approved without much of a fight because after all, if the president won the election 选举, the president therefore should be able to choose who he or she wants in the cabinet. However, there have been times when cabinet appointments have caused an awful lot of tension between the executive and the senate. Even so, when cabinet appointees 被任命者 are contested 竞争；质疑, they usually are still approved by the senate. Now the last time a cabinet appointee was outright 完全地；彻底地 rejected 拒绝；否决 was in 1989 when George H.W. Bush's appointment for secretary of defense 国防部长 was rejected on account of 由于 being an alleged 所谓的 womanizer 玩弄女性者 and a drunkard 酒鬼. Still, there are close calls 千钧一发的时刻，as there was when Donald Trump appointed Betsy DeVos as education secretary because of her beliefs on the privatization 私有化 of education. She had made herself a lot of enemies in the senate, and it came down to a 50-50 tie 平局 on her confirmation 确认；批准. And so my dear pupils, what happens when the senate ties on a vote on the nose? The vice president 副总统 comes in to break that tie, and since Mike Pence was Trump's VP, he went ahead and broke the tie in DeVos's favor. +

Okay, now by far the most contentious 有争议的 appointment the president can make is appointments to federal courts 联邦法院, and especially the supreme court 最高法院. The justices 法官 which the president appoints do have to be confirmed by the senate, and the fighting can be pretty dirty here. And why is that? Well because the stakes 赌注；风险 are so high. Like when the president appoints a federal judge 联邦法官, he or she holds that position for life, and that means court appointments are one way a president can ensure the presidential ideology 意识形态 is upheld 维持；支持 long after the four-year term 任期 is up. Now of course it doesn't always work out that way -- sometimes judges rule 裁决 in ways that are not favorable to the policy agenda of the president that appointed them -- but in general that's how we think about it. +

One of the most famous rejections of a supreme court nominee 被提名者 in recent history is Ronald Reagan's nomination of justice Robert Bork. Now Bork had all the right qualifications 资格；条件 to be a supreme court judge, but he made it no secret that he intended to rule in ways that would roll back the liberal civil rights 公民权利 decisions in the previous decades. He had also written books on how monopolies 垄断 really weren't that bad and how people actually benefited from them. Regardless, the senate took Bork to task 责备；批评 and positively assassinated 诋毁 his character in front of a live television audience, and ultimately Bork was rejected. But his legacy 遗产；影响 does live on by his name: whenever the senate goes after a court appointee like that, it's referred to -- and I kid you not -- as "borking." +

Anyway, the latest court appointee to get borked was Donald Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court in 2018. Again he had all the right qualifications, but Democratic senators 民主党参议员 pounded 猛烈抨击 him for his alleged indiscretions 不检点行为 and possible abuses 虐待；滥用 of women in the past. Now the senate ultimately approved Kavanaugh, but still, Kavanaugh yabort. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。在上一个视频中，我们开始讨论联邦制，在这个视频中，我们将继续讨论联邦制 —— 特别是联邦政府和州政府之间的权力分享是如何随着时间推移而变化的。有时候，大权掌握在“大家长”政府（联邦政府）手中，而有时候则掌握在州政府手中。所以我们需要弄清楚原因。如果你准备好开动脑筋获取知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们只做一件事：解释国家政府和州政府之间适当的权力平衡是如何随着时间推移而被不同解读的。好的，提醒一下，州政府和联邦政府之间的权力分享被称为联邦制，而这两个实体之间权力转移的程度取决于一些宪法条款和两个必备的最高法院案例。 +

那我们从宪法开始讲。你需要了解的关于联邦制的第一个条款是第十修正案。基本上，它规定宪法没有明确授予联邦政府的任何权力都保留给各州 —— 这也解释了为什么我们把这些权力称为保留权力。保留权力的一个例子是对州内贸易的监管。管理州际贸易的权力属于联邦国会，但只有州政府有权管理其州内的贸易。 +

好的，你需要了解的关于联邦制的下一个宪法条款是第十四修正案。这项修正案是在美国历史上内战后的重建时期通过的。你可能还记得，由于第十三修正案，奴隶制被废除了。但那些狡猾的南方各州仍然找到了很多方法来继续维持其社会的种族隔离，并维护白人对黑人的等级制度。 +

即使黑人公民的权利现在受到《权利法案》的保护，但这并没有太大作用，因为 —— 记住 —— 《权利法案》保护公民免受联邦政府的侵害，而不是州政府。问题就在这里：新获得解放的黑人公民在联邦层面享有各种保护，但各州基本上仍可以不受惩罚地侵犯他们的权利。这就是第十四修正案的由来。这项修正案基本上将《权利法案》应用于各州，所以当这项修正案通过时，这意味着公民不仅在联邦政府侵犯其权利时受到保护，在州政府侵犯其权利时也受到保护。 +

好的，你需要了解的关于联邦制的下一个宪法条款是第一条第八款中的商业条款。这个条款赋予国会管理州际贸易的权力，并且随着时间的推移，它被用来为联邦权力提供依据 —— 有时是以牺牲州权力为代价的，我们在讨论最高法院案例时会深入探讨这一点。 +

好的，你需要了解的关于联邦制的下一个宪法条款是必要和适当条款 —— 也被称为弹性条款 —— 同样在第一条第八款中。你可能还记得在之前的视频中我谈到国会的列举权力，这些权力是宪法明确列出属于联邦政府的权力。但该条款以必要和适当条款结尾，基本上规定国会也有权通过任何被认为对于执行其列举权力是必要和适当的法律。这就是为什么它也被称为弹性条款。 +

第一条第八款中列出的权力就像一条皮带，紧紧约束着联邦权力，但必要和适当条款就像给国会提供了一条舒适的运动裤，意思是“好吧，你可以放松一下了”。是我们的朋友亚历山大·汉密尔顿（Alexander Hamilton）援引这个条款来建立了第一家国家银行。如果你读过第一条第八款，你无疑会注意到宪法没有赋予国会建立银行的权力，但它确实规定国会有权征税、铸造货币和管理州际贸易。所以汉密尔顿认为，国会建立银行是必要和适当的，而且他们确实这么做了。 +

我们还可以讨论很多其他的宪法条款，但我只想再讲一个 —— 即第四条中的充分信任和尊重条款。这个条款基本上意味着每个州都必须尊重其他州的法律。例如，如果我在佐治亚州（Georgia）获得了驾照，然后开车去加利福尼亚州（California），我的驾照在我经过的每个州都应该被认可为有效。如果没有充分信任和尊重条款，我每次跨越州界都得重新获取驾照。这个条款还意味着我在佐治亚州的婚姻在其他每个州也必须得到认可。 +

但联邦制中重要的部分来了：假设一个州已经将同性婚姻合法化，但另一个州没有。比如说，一对同性伴侣在夏威夷州（Hawaii）结婚，然后搬到阿拉巴马州（Alabama）。如果阿拉巴马州的法律不承认同性婚姻，那么这个州是否必须遵守充分信任和尊重条款呢？嗯，1996年，国会通过了《捍卫婚姻法案》（the Defense of Marriage Act，简称DOMA），该法案赋予各州不承认同性伴侣婚姻状况的权利。所以在这种情况下，各州在主张自己的权力。 +

但在2015年，在奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案（Obergefell v. Hodges）中，权力又转移到了联邦政府这边，因为这个判决认定婚姻 —— 无论涉及的双方性别如何 —— 是一项基本权利，各州不能侵犯。 +

好的，现在我们需要深入了解两个必备的最高法院案例，它们说明了联邦政府和州政府之间的权力转移。因为这些是必备案例，每个案例都有专门的视频，讲解得比我在这里讲的要深入得多。 +

第一个案例是1819年的麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案（McCulloch v. Maryland）。在第二家美国银行（the Bank of the United States）设立的时候，国会在马里兰州（Maryland）设立了一个分行。马里兰州立法机构表示“你们太疯狂了”，并对这家银行征收了一大笔税。当银行职员拒绝纳税时，这个案件最终提交到了最高法院。马里兰州辩称，宪法中没有赋予国会在一个州的境内设立国家银行分行的权力。但麦卡洛克（McCulloch）的律师认为，根据必要和适当条款，国会确实有这个权力。 +

结果是，最高法院同意了这种观点，称必要和适当条款意味着联邦政府拥有某些权力，即使这些权力在宪法中没有明确提及。但更重要的是，首席大法官约翰·马歇尔（John Marshall）指出，由于宪法的最高权力条款，当联邦法律和州法律发生冲突时，联邦法律总是优先于州法律。所以就联邦制而言，很难找到一个比麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案更能使权力平衡向联邦政府倾斜的案例了。 +

但现在让我们看一个使权力平衡向州政府倾斜的案例，为此我要给你介绍1995年的美国诉洛佩兹案（United States v. Lopez）。在20世纪80年代和90年代，国会非常关注枪支暴力问题，所以他们通过了1990年的《无枪校区法案》（the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990），该法案禁止在学校范围内持有枪支。记住，这是一项联邦法律，而且根据宪法，国会没有权力这么做，因为这不在列举权力之内。但这次他们的理由不是必要和适当条款 —— 而是商业条款。 +

他们的推理是这样的：如果学校范围内有枪支，那么学习环境就会变差，然后社区也会变得更糟，最终会损害州际贸易。对此我想说…… 什么？所以当一个孩子在德克萨斯州（Texas）的学校携带枪支时，他根据这项联邦法律被起诉并定罪。当这个案件提交到最高法院时，大法官们这次做出了有利于各州的裁决。他们明确表示，枪支法律属于各州的管辖范围，而且枪支管制无论如何都不能与州际贸易联系起来。 +

好的，感谢观看。如果你想在课堂上得A并且在五月份的考试中得5分，这里有复习资料包。如果这个视频对你有帮助，我还有关于第一单元的更多视频。如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那么一定要订阅，我会照做的。海姆勒下线了。 +
