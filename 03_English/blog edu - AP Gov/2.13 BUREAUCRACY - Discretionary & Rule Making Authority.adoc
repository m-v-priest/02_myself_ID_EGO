Well, hey there and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through unit 2 of the AP government curriculum 课程, and more specifically we've started talking about the federal bureaucracy 联邦官僚机构. So in this video we're going to see exactly how the federal bureaucracy carries out 执行 the will of the executive branch 行政部门. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So in this video here's what we're trying to do: explain how the federal bureaucracy uses delegated discretionary authority 委托自由裁量权 for rulemaking 制定规则 and implementation 执行. Okay, a lot of big hairy words in there, but let me just explain it up real nice for you. First, let me remind you what the federal bureaucracy is. The federal bureaucracy is made up of 由…组成 the couple million people who work for all the agencies 机构 and departments that fall under the authority of 受…管辖 the executive branch. +

Remember that the executive branch of the federal government is there to execute the laws 执行法律. Congress passes the laws, the supreme court interprets the laws 解释法律, but it's the job of the executive branch to make sure people like you and me are actually abiding by 遵守 those laws. Now the figurehead 名义领袖 of the executive branch is of course the president, and constitutionally 从宪法角度讲 it's the president who's responsible for executing the law. But one president can't possibly go everywhere in the nation to make sure that we're paying our taxes on time or keeping air pollution within the legal limits. So if one guy can't do that, how does the law get executed on the nose? The bureaucracy does it. +

And as I mentioned in the last video, there are butt loads of 大量的 bureaucratic departments 官僚部门 and agencies whose job it is to make the finer, more concrete 具体的 rules and regulations 规章制度 to enforce the law 执行法律. If that doesn't make sense to you, think about it like this: suppose your parents decide to go out for a night and they leave you in charge of 负责 your little brother, and before they leave they say "your brother has to clean his room while we're gone, and you are responsible for making sure that he does it," and then they leave. So you're left with a directive 指令 and the outcome 结果 is clear, but the details 细节 are vague 模糊的. Like, does he need to clean his room first before he does anything else? Can he play video games first and then clean his room? How clean does the room have to be in order to satisfy the parents' requests? And on and on. All of those details are left up to you, just as long as in the end the room is clean. +

So you see your little brother down, you tell him that mom and dad said he has to clean his room -- like, you can play video games for 30 minutes, then you have to pick up all your clothes, vacuum the floor 吸尘, and make your bed, and then you can do whatever you want. That's essentially 本质上 what the bureaucracy does. So congress passes a law like the Clean Air Act 清洁空气法案, which says in pretty vague terms 相当模糊的措辞 that businesses need to change the way they operate in order to keep the air clean from pollutants 污染物. But the thing is, the folks in congress aren't biologists, they're not climatologists 气候学家, they're not whatever -- they don't know anything about the mechanics 原理 of pollution and how it's produced and what concrete strategies 具体策略 need to be implemented 实施 to clean up factory emissions 工厂排放物. But you know who does know that stuff? The Environmental Protection Agency 环境保护署, which is a bureaucratic agency 官僚机构 stuffed with 充满 environmental experts 环境专家. So the parents say "don't pollute as much," and they leave the EPA to make the specific and concrete rules for how that is actually going to become a reality. +

Okay, I've said a lot of words to describe to you the kind of power the bureaucracy has, and the term for that is delegated discretionary authority. The bureaucratic agencies really have no constitutional authority 宪法权力 of their own, so the power that they have is delegated to 委托给 them to enforce the law. And since these agencies are filled with experts in the given field 特定领域, they have discretion 自由裁量权 to decide exactly how and when to implement the law. Additionally 此外, the bureaucracy has rule-making authority 制定规则的权力, which again means they're the ones who make the specific rules for how the law will be carried out. +

So let me give you an example. The 16th Amendment 第十六修正案, which was ratified 批准 in 1913, establishes the income tax 所得税, and here's how it reads: "the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration." You know what? That's pretty basic. It just says people gotta pay taxes on their income. Okay, how is that actually going to happen? Well, that's where a bureaucratic agency called the Internal Revenue Service 国内收入署 steps in 介入. The IRS is the one who makes all the rules for how taxes are going to be collected. It's the IRS who said that taxes are due April 15th. It's the IRS who decides how we pay those taxes -- can we pay in cash? Can we pay online? Can we pay with a stack of ham sandwiches equal to the value of our withholdings? All of those are rules created by the IRS in order to implement the very broad law that we must pay our income taxes. Just in case you were wondering, you cannot in fact pay your taxes with a ham sandwich. +

Okay, I hope all of that makes sense. Now, the AP overlords 主宰者 don't just want you to know how bureaucratic departments and agencies and commissions 委员会 work -- they also want you to know the following seven examples along with examples of their discretionary authority. +

First is the Department of Homeland Security 国土安全部, which exists to protect Americans from terrorism 恐怖主义 and to maintain control of 控制 our borders 边境. They have rules, for example, over which immigrants 移民 are admitted 准许进入 and which are not, and which can seek asylum 寻求庇护 within the borders of the United States. +

Second is the Department of Transportation 交通部, which manages all kinds of transportation like highway 公路 and air travel 航空旅行. They have rules, for example, governing how many hours a flight attendant 空乘人员 can work and how much rest they need before starting another shift 轮班. +

Third is the Department of Veteran Affairs 退伍军人事务部, which exists to manage the general welfare 总体福利 of our nation's veterans 退伍军人. They have rules about the creation of veterans hospitals 退伍军人医院 and how they're staffed 配备人员, and they have rules about education and home loans 住房贷款 going to veterans. +

Fourth is the Department of Education 教育部, which manages states and their implementation of federal educational standards 联邦教育标准. They make rules about, among many other things, how schools receive federal grants 联邦拨款 and what qualifications 资格 are necessary to receive them. +

Fifth is the Environmental Protection Agency 环境保护署, which exists to protect the environment and human health through environmental regulations 环境法规. The reason a nuclear power plant 核电站 can't just dump all their nuclear waste 核废料 into our rivers is because of the rules and regulations established by the EPA. +

Sixth is the Federal Elections Commission 联邦选举委员会, which administers 管理 and enforces 执行 campaign finance laws 竞选资金法. They have rules regarding 关于 how a person becomes an official political candidate 正式政治候选人, and rules about how much money they can raise and from whom and what they can do with it, etc. +

And finally, you need to know the Securities and Exchange Commission 证券交易委员会, which regulates the stock market 监管股票市场 and prevents fraud 防止欺诈. If you've ever heard of anyone getting in trouble because they sold a bunch of stocks one day and then the next day the company tanked 倒闭 -- which would be an example of insider trading 内幕交易 -- then that means they broke one of the SEC's rules against this kind of thing. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第二单元，更具体地说，我们已经开始讨论联邦官僚机构。所以在这个视频中，我们将确切地了解联邦官僚机构是如何执行行政部门的意愿的。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释联邦官僚机构如何利用被授予的自由裁量权来制定规则并执行。好的，这里有很多复杂的词汇，但让我为你好好解释一下。首先，让我提醒你什么是联邦官僚机构。联邦官僚机构由数百万为隶属于行政部门的各个机构和部门工作的人员组成。 +

记住，联邦政府的行政部门的职责是执行法律。国会通过法律，最高法院解释法律，但确保像你我这样的人切实遵守这些法律是行政部门的工作。行政部门的名义首脑当然是总统，从宪法角度来说，总统负责执行法律。但一位总统不可能走遍全国确保我们按时纳税或使空气污染控制在法律范围内。那么，如果一个人做不到这些，法律是如何切实得到执行的呢？这就要靠官僚机构了。 +

正如我在上一个视频中提到的，有大量的官僚部门和机构，它们的工作是制定更精细、更具体的规则和条例来执行法律。如果你不理解这一点，可以这样想：假设你的父母决定出去一晚，让你负责照顾你的小弟弟，他们离开前说 “我们不在的时候，你弟弟必须打扫他的房间，你要负责确保他做到”，然后他们就离开了。所以你得到了一个指示，结果是明确的，但细节是模糊的。比如，他必须在做其他事情之前先打扫房间吗？他可以先玩电子游戏然后再打扫房间吗？房间要打扫到什么程度才能满足父母的要求呢？诸如此类。所有这些细节都由你决定，只要最后房间是干净的就行。 +

所以你看着你的小弟弟，告诉他爸爸妈妈说他必须打扫房间——比如说，你可以玩30分钟电子游戏，然后你必须捡起所有的衣服，用吸尘器吸地板，整理床铺，然后你就可以做任何你想做的事情。这基本上就是官僚机构所做的事情。所以国会通过了像《清洁空气法》这样的法律，该法律相当模糊地规定企业需要改变运营方式以保持空气不受污染物污染。但问题是，国会议员不是生物学家，不是气候学家，他们不知道污染的原理，不知道污染是如何产生的，也不知道需要实施哪些具体策略来清理工厂排放物。但你知道谁了解这些吗？环境保护署（Environmental Protection Agency），这是一个由环境专家组成的官僚机构。所以就像父母说 “不要污染太多”，然后让环境保护署制定具体的规则来使这一要求成为现实。 +

好的，我已经说了很多来描述官僚机构所拥有的权力，描述这种权力的术语是 “被授予的自由裁量权（delegated discretionary authority）”。官僚机构本身在宪法上没有权力，所以它们拥有的权力是被授予的，以便执行法律。而且由于这些机构里都是特定领域的专家，他们有权决定如何以及何时执行法律。此外，官僚机构拥有制定规则的权力，这意味着它们要制定法律如何实施的具体规则。 +

让我给你举个例子。1913年批准的第十六修正案（16th amendment）确立了所得税，其内容是：“国会有权对来自任何来源的收入征税，无需在各州之间进行分摊，也无需考虑任何人口普查或统计。” 你知道吗？这相当基础。它只是说人们必须为他们的收入纳税。好的，那实际是怎么操作的呢？嗯，这时候一个叫做国税局（Internal Revenue Service，IRS）的官僚机构就介入了。国税局制定了所有关于如何收税的规则。是国税局规定4月15日是纳税截止日期。是国税局决定我们如何纳税——我们可以用现金支付吗？我们可以在网上支付吗？我们可以用价值等同于预扣税款的一堆火腿三明治来支付税款吗？所有这些都是国税局为了执行 “我们必须缴纳所得税” 这一宽泛的法律而制定的规则。以防你有疑问，实际上你不能用火腿三明治来纳税。 +

好的，我希望这一切你都能理解。现在，AP课程的主导者们不仅希望你了解官僚部门、机构和委员会是如何运作的——他们还希望你了解以下七个例子以及它们的自由裁量权的例子。 +

首先是国土安全部（Department of Homeland Security），它的存在是为了保护美国人免受恐怖主义威胁并控制边境。他们制定了规则，例如，哪些移民可以被接纳，哪些不可以，以及哪些人可以在美国境内寻求庇护。 +

其次是交通部（Department of Transportation），它管理着各种交通事务，比如高速公路和航空旅行。他们制定了规则，例如，规定空乘人员可以工作多少小时，以及他们在开始下一个班次之前需要休息多长时间。 +

第三是退伍军人事务部（Department of Veteran Affairs），它的存在是为了管理我国退伍军人的总体福利。他们制定了关于退伍军人医院的设立以及人员配备的规则，还有关于退伍军人教育和住房贷款的规则。 +

第四是教育部（Department of Education），它管理各州对联邦教育标准的执行情况。他们制定了规则，其中包括学校如何获得联邦拨款以及获得拨款需要具备哪些资格。 +

第五是环境保护署（Environmental Protection Agency），它通过环境法规来保护环境和人类健康。核电站不能随意将所有核废料倾倒进我们的河流，这是因为环境保护署制定的规则和条例。 +

第六是联邦选举委员会（Federal Elections Commission），它管理和执行竞选资金法。他们制定了关于一个人如何成为正式政治候选人的规则，以及关于他们可以筹集多少资金、从谁那里筹集资金以及如何使用这些资金等方面的规则。 +

最后，你需要了解证券交易委员会（Securities and Exchange Commission），它监管股票市场并防止欺诈行为。如果你听说过有人因为先卖出大量股票，而第二天公司股价暴跌而陷入麻烦——这就是内幕交易的一个例子——那就意味着他们违反了证券交易委员会针对此类事情制定的规则。 +
