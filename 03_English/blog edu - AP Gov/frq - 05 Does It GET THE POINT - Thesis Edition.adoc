Welcome to "Does It Get the Point?" -- Thesis Edition for the AP Government Argumentative Essay. Constructing 构建 a good thesis 论点 is probably one of the more important things you're going to do on this essay because it establishes 确立 the argument 论证 of the rest of the essay and the categories of analysis 分析类别. So you can't afford to 承担不起 write a bad thesis. And credit where credit is due 恰如其分地称赞 -- everything I'm about to show you was published by the College Board 大学理事会, and the link to the document is in the description. All right, let's jump in. +

Here's the prompt 题目 we're going to consider: "The power of the executive branch 行政部门 in relation to 关于 the legislative branch 立法部门 has varied over time 随着时间变化. Develop an argument that takes a position on the appropriate balance of power 适当的权力平衡 between the president and the Congress 国会." And then they give you three documents you could potentially 可能地 use for evidence 证据: the Declaration of Independence 《独立宣言》, Federalist 51 《联邦党人文集》第51篇, and Federalist 70 《联邦党人文集》第70篇. Now let's look at some theses and try to determine whether they earn the point 得分. +

Remember, in order to earn the point, the rubric 评分标准 says that the thesis must respond to 回应 the prompt with a defensible claim 站得住脚的主张 or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning 确立一条推理思路. Now there are three things in that explanation you should pay attention to. First, it responds to the prompt -- and that means that the thesis needs to be on topic 切题. If you write the most magnificent 精彩的 thesis about bureaucratic overreach 官僚权力扩张, it won't matter because that is not what the question is asking. Second, the thesis needs to put forth 提出 a defensible claim. That means that your argument has to be factually accurate 事实准确的. Like if you say that the president has the power to rule with an iron fist 铁腕统治 like Genghis Khan 成吉思汗, that would not be accurate. And third, the thesis must establish a line of reasoning. That just means you need to show how or why your defensible claim is true. +

So let's jump into the theses. Thesis number one: "The power of the executive and legislative branches of government are important because there is a balance of power." Think about it -- does that earn the point? No. And here's why. Is this thesis making a true statement? Yes, there is a balance of power between the two branches. But that's not what the prompt is asking. It's asking you to develop an argument about the appropriate balance of power between the two branches. So this thesis does not earn the point because while it does state a fact, it doesn't make an argument. Really, this thesis is just restating 重述 the prompt, which is a big no-no 禁忌 in AP Government writing -- no matter what your ninth grade English teacher told you. +

Okay, thesis number two: "The executive branch is the most effective branch of the government because the president has many constitutional powers 宪法权力." Does this get the point? No. Why? Because it is totally irrelevant to 与…完全无关 the prompt. I mean, technically this thesis makes a true statement, even as vague 模糊的 as it is, but all it does is talk about the effectiveness 有效性 of the president. Again, the prompt is about the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. So no point for you. So the first takeaway 要点 after these two theses is this: make sure that you are responding to the question that they are asking, not the question you wish they were asking. +

Okay, thesis number three: "The power of the executive should be strengthened relative to Congress because Congress is slow to react and sometimes ends up in gridlock 陷入僵局." Does that get the point? Heck yes it does. I mean, look -- it's actually talking about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. It also makes an argument, namely 即 that the executive branch should be more powerful. And then it establishes a line of reasoning -- in other words, it shows why the executive branch should be stronger: Congress is slow and sometimes ends up in gridlock. And that is exactly what you need to do. +

All right, let's look at one more: "The power of Congress should be strengthened relative to the president because Congress is the representative of the will of the people 人民意志的代表." Does that earn the point? Yes it does. Everything the previous thesis did, but notice it's actually making the opposite argument. This student is saying that Congress should be more powerful than the executive, and both of these earned the point even though they're making opposite claims. So what should you take away from that? Well, within the realm of factually correct theses, there is no right or wrong answer. There are only well-argued answers and poorly argued answers. And a well-argued answer starts with a good thesis. +

Now right here is a playlist 播放列表 that's going to help you understand how to score well on all the writing you'll need to do on the AP Government exam, so you should absolutely check that out next. I'll see you around. Heimler out. +

欢迎来到 “能否得分？—— 美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程议论文的论点篇”。构建一个好的论点可能是你在这篇议论文中要做的更重要的事情之一，因为它确立了文章其余部分的论证以及分析的类别。所以你可不能写出一个糟糕的论点。该归功于谁就归功于谁 —— 我即将展示给你的所有内容都由大学理事会（College Board）发布，文档的链接在描述中。好的，我们开始吧。 +

这是我们要考虑的问题提示：“行政分支相对于立法分支的权力随着时间而变化。就总统和国会之间适当的权力平衡展开论证。” 然后他们给你三篇你可能用作证据的文档：《独立宣言》（Declaration of Independence）、《联邦党人文集》第 51 篇（Federalist 51）以及《联邦党人文集》第 70 篇（Federalist 70）。现在我们来看一些论点，并试着判断它们是否能得分。 +

记住，为了得分，评分标准规定论点必须用一个站得住脚的主张或论点来回应问题提示，并确立一条推理思路。在这个解释中有三点你应该注意。首先，它要回应问题提示 —— 这意味着论点需要切题。如果你写出一个关于官僚权力过度扩张的精彩论点，但这与问题所问的无关，那就不行。其次，论点需要提出一个站得住脚的主张。这意味着你的论证必须在事实上是准确的。比如，如果你说总统拥有像成吉思汗（Genghis Khan）那样用铁腕统治的权力，那就是不准确的。第三，论点必须确立一条推理思路。这意味着你需要展示你的站得住脚的主张为什么是正确的。 +

那么我们来看这些论点。论点一：“政府的行政分支和立法分支的权力很重要，因为存在权力平衡。” 想想看 —— 这个论点能得分吗？不能。原因如下。这个论点陈述的是一个真实的情况吗？是的，两个分支之间确实存在权力平衡。但这不是问题提示所问的。问题提示要求你就两个分支之间适当的权力平衡展开论证。所以这个论点不能得分，因为虽然它陈述了一个事实，但它没有提出一个论证。说真的，这个论点只是重述了问题提示，这在 AP 政府课程的写作中是大忌 —— 不管你的九年级英语老师是怎么教你的。 +

好的，论点二：“行政分支是政府最有效的分支，因为总统拥有许多宪法赋予的权力。” 这个论点能得分吗？不能。为什么呢？因为它与问题提示完全不相关。我的意思是，从技术上讲，这个论点陈述的是一个真实的情况，尽管它很模糊，但它只是在谈论总统的有效性。同样，问题提示是关于立法分支和行政分支之间的权力平衡。所以这个论点不能得分。从这两个论点中我们得到的第一个要点是：确保你回答的是他们提出的问题，而不是你希望他们提出的问题。 +

好的，论点三：“相对于国会，行政分支的权力应该得到加强，因为国会反应迟缓，有时会陷入僵局。” 这个论点能得分吗？当然能。我的意思是，看 —— 它实际上在谈论行政分支和立法分支之间的权力平衡。它也提出了一个论证，即行政分支应该更有权力。然后它确立了一条推理思路 —— 换句话说，它展示了为什么行政分支应该更强大：国会反应迟缓，有时会陷入僵局。这正是你需要做的。 +

好的，我们再看一个：“相对于总统，国会的权力应该得到加强，因为国会是人民意志的代表。” 这个论点能得分吗？能。它做了前面那个论点所做的一切，但要注意它实际上提出了相反的论证。这个学生说国会应该比行政分支更有权力，而且这两个论点都能得分，尽管它们提出了相反的主张。那么从这里我们能得到什么呢？嗯，在事实正确的论点范围内，没有绝对的对错答案。只有论证充分的答案和论证不充分的答案。而一个论证充分的答案要从一个好的论点开始。 +

这里有一个播放列表，它将帮助你理解如何在美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程考试的所有写作部分中取得好成绩，所以你一定要接着看看这个播放列表。回头见。海姆勒，退出。 +
