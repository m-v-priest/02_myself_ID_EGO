Hey there and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 1 of the AP Government curriculum, and in this video it's time to talk about the debate between Federalist 10 and Brutus 1 with respect to 关于 the power of the government. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then let's get to it. +
Okay, so in this video here's what we're aiming to do: explain how Federalist and Anti-Federalist views on central government and democracy are reflected in U.S. foundational documents. Now I've got two videos on Federalist 10 and Brutus 1 respectively 分别地 -- you can watch those if you want to know the details about the contents of those documents -- but for now we're just going to consider the ideological 意识形态的 debate between the two over the value of democracy and liberty. +
Now the main idea of the debate was about majority rule 多数统治 versus 与... 相比 minority rights 少数群体权利. When I say minority here, don't get confused -- I don't mean ethnic minorities 少数民族，I mean the opposite of majority. And in the context of this debate, we're talking about regional 地区的 and economic majorities and minorities. And there were some very pressing 紧迫的 questions being debated. For example, how could they ensure that small land owners (of which there were many) would not impose 强加 a devastating 毁灭性的 tax burden on the wealthy elite (of which there were very few)? Or how could they ensure that agricultural interests wouldn't dominate industrial interests, or vice versa 反之亦然？Etc., etc. +
Now the two main groups fighting about these kinds of things during the ratification 批准 debates for the Constitution were the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists. The Federalists included folks like Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, and they were arguing for more centralized power in the federal government, which is what we'd get if the Constitution was ratified. The Anti - Federalists on the other hand included folks like Patrick Henry and George Mason, and they argued against the ratification of the Constitution because they thought that the current government in which power was invested in the states was just fine, thank you very much. +
So this debate over majority rule versus minority rights found its way into print, and both Federalists and Anti - Federalists published essays in New York newspapers which argued their respective perspectives, and these became known as the Federalist Papers and the Anti - Federalist Papers. And that's where we get our foundational documents Federalist 10 and Brutus 1. +
So let's start with Federalist 10. The main argument in this document is concerning the "mischief of faction," and factions are just groups of people who believe that their interests are more important than any other interest. So the problem is this: if the majority always prevailed, then the minority would never be represented. However, if too many protections were provided to the minority, then the common good would never prevail. +
So the solution to these problems in Federalist 10 is to create a republican - style government (which is what the Constitution provided). Under a republican government -- not to be confused with the Republican Party, different thing altogether -- anyway, under a republican government, and then combined with the sheer size and population of the United States, there will be so many factions (so many competing interests) that they would have to debate and compromise in order to get any laws passed, and therefore majority rule and minority rights upheld. +
But the Anti - Federalist in Brutus 1 were uh... not impressed with those arguments. They said that history had never seen a republican - style government govern a population in a landmass as large as the United States, and because of the necessary and proper clause and the supremacy clause of the Constitution, a powerful central government would render state governments unnecessary, thus squashing the interests of the states. Therefore, if liberty is to be maintained in our fair country, the Constitution with all its centralized power should not be ratified. +
Now the Anti - Federalist Papers were a lot less organized than the Federalist Papers were. The Anti - Federalists just kind of published their essays willy - nilly without much concerted effort, and so you've got lots of different authors contributing to this canon of anti - constitutional literature. For example, in addition to Brutus 1, you have Letters from the Federal Farmer, which Hamilton acknowledged to be the most cogent of the Anti - Federalist writers. Whoever wrote these said in the first one: "The plan of government now proposed is evidently calculated totally to change, in time, our condition as a people. Instead of being 13 republics under a federal head, it is clearly designed to make us one consolidated government." So it's just another example of the same argument being made in Brutus 1. +
Now of course ultimately it was the Federalists who won that debate, and that means we got ourselves a new governing document in the Constitution of the United States. But alas, that will have to wait for another video. All right, that's what you need to know about Unit 1 Topic 3 of the AP Government curriculum.

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。我们一直在学习 AP 政府课程的第 1 单元，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈《联邦党人文集》第 10 篇和《布鲁图斯》第 1 篇中关于政府权力的辩论。所以如果你准备好开动脑筋获取知识，那就开始吧。 +
好的，在这个视频中我们的目标是：解释联邦党人和反联邦党人关于中央政府和民主的观点是如何体现在美国的基础文件中的。我分别做了关于《联邦党人文集》第 10 篇和《布鲁图斯》第 1 篇的视频 —— 如果你想了解这些文件的详细内容可以去看看 —— 但现在我们只考虑两者之间关于民主和自由价值的意识形态辩论。 +
这场辩论的主要观点是关于多数统治与少数权利的问题。当我在这里说 “少数” 时，不要混淆了 —— 我不是指少数族裔，我指的是与 “多数” 相对的概念。在这场辩论的背景下，我们谈论的是地区和经济上的多数和少数。有一些非常紧迫的问题在辩论中被提出。例如，他们如何确保小土地所有者（这样的人有很多）不会对富有的精英（这样的人很少）施加毁灭性的税收负担呢？或者他们如何确保农业利益不会主导工业利益，反之亦然呢？等等。 +
在《宪法》批准辩论期间，围绕这些问题争论的两个主要团体是联邦党人和反联邦党人。联邦党人包括像亚历山大・汉密尔顿（Alexander Hamilton）、詹姆斯・麦迪逊（James Madison）和约翰・杰伊（John Jay）这样的人，他们主张联邦政府拥有更多的中央集权，这是如果《宪法》被批准后会出现的情况。另一方面，反联邦党人包括像帕特里克・亨利（Patrick Henry）和乔治・梅森（George Mason）这样的人，他们反对《宪法》的批准，因为他们认为权力掌握在各州手中的现有政府就挺好的，非常感谢。 +
所以这场关于多数统治与少数权利的辩论被写成文字发表了，联邦党人和反联邦党人都在纽约的报纸上发表文章阐述他们各自的观点，这些文章后来被称为《联邦党人文集》和《反联邦党人文集》。这就是我们的基础文件《联邦党人文集》第 10 篇和《布鲁图斯》第 1 篇的由来。 +
那么让我们从《联邦党人文集》第 10 篇开始。这篇文章的主要论点是关于 “派别带来的危害”，派别就是那些认为自己的利益比其他任何利益都更重要的人群团体。所以问题是这样的：如果多数总是占上风，那么少数的利益就永远无法得到代表。然而，如果给予少数太多的保护，那么公共利益就永远无法实现。 +
所以《联邦党人文集》第 10 篇中对这些问题的解决方案是创建一个共和政体（这也是《宪法》所提供的）。在共和政体下 —— 不要和共和党混淆，这是完全不同的概念 —— 不管怎样，在共和政体下，再结合美国庞大的规模和人口，会有如此多的派别（如此多相互竞争的利益），他们将不得不进行辩论和妥协，以便通过任何法律，这样多数统治和少数权利都能得到维护。 +
但是《布鲁图斯》第 1 篇中的反联邦党人对这些论点并不买账。他们说历史上从未有过共和政体能够治理像美国这样幅员辽阔的国家的人口，而且由于《宪法》中的 “必要和适当条款” 以及 “最高权力条款”，一个强大的中央政府会使州政府变得不必要，从而压制各州的利益。因此，如果要在我们这个美好的国家维护自由，带有所有中央集权的《宪法》就不应该被批准。 +
现在《反联邦党人文集》不像《联邦党人文集》那样有条理。反联邦党人发表文章比较随意，没有太多的协调，所以有很多不同的作者为反《宪法》文献做出了贡献。例如，除了《布鲁图斯》第 1 篇，还有《联邦农民来信》，汉密尔顿认为这是反联邦党人作者中最有说服力的作品。写这些信的人在第一封信中说：“现在提出的政府计划显然是为了及时彻底改变我们作为一个民族的状况。它不是让我们成为在联邦领导下的 13 个共和国，而是明确旨在让我们成为一个统一的政府。” 所以这只是和《布鲁图斯》第 1 篇中观点相同的另一个例子。 +
当然，最终是联邦党人赢得了这场辩论，这意味着我们有了美国《宪法》这部新的治理文件。但唉，关于《宪法》的更多内容我们要留到另一个视频再讲。好了，这就是 AP 政府课程第 1 单元第 3 个 topic 你需要知道的内容。如果你需要帮助在课堂上得 A 并且在五月份的考试中得 5 分，点击这里获取一份复习资料包。如果你希望我继续为你制作这些视频，那就订阅来告诉我吧。海姆勒下线了。 +

Hey there and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 1 of the AP Government curriculum, and in this video it's time to talk about the debate between Federalist 10 and Brutus 1 with respect to the power of the government. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then let's get to it.

Okay, so in this video here's what we're aiming to do: explain how Federalist and Anti-Federalist views on central government and democracy are reflected in U.S. foundational documents. Now I've got two videos on Federalist 10 and Brutus 1 respectively -- you can watch those if you want to know the details about the contents of those documents -- but for now we're just going to consider the ideological debate between the two over the value of democracy and liberty.

Now the main idea of the debate was about majority rule versus minority rights. When I say minority here, don't get confused -- I don't mean ethnic minorities, I mean the opposite of majority. And in the context of this debate, we're talking about regional and economic majorities and minorities. And there were some very pressing questions being debated.

And that's where we get our foundational documents Federalist 10 and Brutus 1.

So let's start with Federalist 10. The main argument in this document is concerning the "mischief of faction," and factions are just groups of people who believe that their interests are more important than any other interest. So the problem is this: if the majority always prevailed, then the minority would never be represented.
