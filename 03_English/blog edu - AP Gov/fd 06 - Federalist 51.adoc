Hey there, welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're continuing to look at the required foundational documents 必备基础文献 for AP Government, and that means it's time to talk about Federalist 51 《联邦党人文集》第51篇. So if you're ready to get the brain cows milked separation-of-power 权力分立 style, let's get to it. +

So right out of the gate 一开始, let's begin with the central and most famous passage in this essay written by James Madison: "What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary." So here you get a real sense of Madison's opinion of humankind 人类. Like if people were angels, we wouldn't even need a government -- everybody would just act right. But people are not angels in Madison's estimation 看法. Human beings are a lot less like angels and more like selfish, sentient 有感知力的 turds （俚语，可鄙的人）dressed up in clothes. +

So in light of that 鉴于此, human beings need a government, and that government is there to protect the liberty 自由 of the people. And so supposing we agree on that, the next question is: how do we create a government that both has the power to protect liberty while at the same time does not have enough power to destroy liberty? Madison says it this way: "In framing 构建 a government which is to be administered 管理 by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed 被统治者, and in the next place oblige 迫使 it to control itself." +

So what's the answer? How do you create a government that is both powerful and yet not too powerful? Madison's answer: the separation of powers 权力分立 and checks and balances 制衡. "And this manner of restricting power 限制权力 cannot be imposed upon the branches of government externally 从外部; rather, the defects must be supplied by so contriving 设计 the interior structure 内部结构 of the government as that its several constituent parts 组成部分 may, by their mutual relations 相互关系, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places." So the different branches of government must be created in such a way that they balance and check each other's power. +

So how would such a government look? Well first, Madison says: "It is evident that each department should have a will of its own 独立的意志, and consequently 因此 should be so constituted 组成 that the members of each should have as little agency 影响力 as possible in the appointment of the members of the others." He says each branch needs as much power independent of the others as possible, so they can't go around messing at each other's business 干涉彼此事务. And that power needs to be basically equal between the three branches. +

But there is an objection 反对意见 here. If you look at the Constitution, it's pretty clear that a disproportionate amount of 不成比例的 power is put into the hands of the legislative branch 立法部门 -- which is to say Congress 国会. And look, that's exactly as it should be, since it's Congress which directly represents the voice of the people. So if we're wanting to keep things equal power-wise 在权力方面, what are you going to do to this beefy 强大的 legislature 立法机构 over here? You're going to have to divide that power too. "The remedy 补救措施 for this inconveniency 不便之处 is to divide the legislature into different branches, and to render them by different modes of election 选举方式 and different principles of action 行动原则 as little connected with each other as the nature of their common functions 共同职能 and their common dependence on society will admit." +

So how do we keep the legislature from having too much power? You divide its power into two, which is exactly what the Constitution did. Congress is divided into a bicameral legislature 两院制立法机构 which is composed of 由…组成 both of the House 众议院 and the Senate 参议院, each of which holds a portion of the legislative power 立法权. If your heart is already beating fast at all that subdivision of power 权力细分, well then Madison goes even further and keeps chopping 分割: "In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by the people 人民让渡的权力 is first divided between two distinct governments 两个不同的政府, and then the portion allotted to each 分配给每个政府的部分 subdivided 再细分 among distinct and separate departments." +

So not only is the federal government's power divided among the branches, power is then further divided between the national government 国家政府 and the state governments 州政府 -- which is a system of governance 治理体系 called federalism 联邦制. So with power divided in a portion to so many different actors 主体, liberty will necessarily be upheld 维护, even though the Constitution is placing more power in the hands of the federal government than there was under the Articles of Confederation 《邦联条例》. +

But if you are not convinced that this division of power will keep the government's power in its proper bounds 适当范围, the Constitution also provides a system of checks and balances through which each branch can check the power of the others. So for example, the executive branch 行政部门 can check the legislative branch 立法部门 by vetoing laws 否决法律. The legislative branch can check the executive branch by its powers of impeachment 弹劾 and removal from office 罢免. The judicial branch 司法部门 can check the other two branches by ruling on the constitutionality of laws and executive actions 裁定法律和行政行为的合宪性. Those are only a few examples, but the point is each branch has the power to restrain 限制 the power of the other branches. +

And that in Madison's estimation provides what he calls a double security of protection for the liberty of the people. And then Madison spends the rest of his essay talking again -- like he did in Federalist 10 -- about the dangers of factions 派系. He returns to the same conclusion: the more factions there are, the less able any one of them will be to dominate the rest 主导其余派系. And so in the case of factions, just like in the separation of powers in the government, a single principle prevails 占主导地位: "Ambition must be made to counteract ambition 野心必须用来对抗野心." In other words, we don't have angels governing us, nor are we ourselves angels. Rather, people and governments always seek to preserve their own interests against the interests of everyone else, and that means the best expedient 权宜之计 to liberty -- given our corrupted human nature 堕落的人性 -- is to set all our ambitions against each other. And in that way, tyranny 暴政 cannot be entertained 得逞 because compromise and concession 妥协和让步 will be required to get anything done. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将继续研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的必学基础文献，这意味着我们要谈谈《联邦党人文集》第51篇（Federalist 51）。所以，如果你准备好以权力制衡的方式激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

那么，一开始，让我们从詹姆斯·麦迪逊（James Madison）撰写的这篇文章中最核心、最著名的段落开始：“政府本身不就是对人性的最大反思吗？如果人是天使，就不需要政府了。如果天使来统治人，那么对政府的外部或内部控制都没有必要了。” 所以从这里你能真切地感受到麦迪逊对人类的看法。就好比如果人是天使，我们甚至不需要政府 —— 每个人都会行事得当。但在麦迪逊的认知里，人不是天使。人类远非天使，更像是穿着衣服的、自私的、有感知的混蛋。 +

鉴于此，人类需要一个政府，而这个政府的存在是为了保护人民的自由。所以假设我们认同这一点，下一个问题就是：我们要如何创建一个既有权保护自由，同时又不会强大到破坏自由的政府呢？麦迪逊是这样说的：“在构建一个由人来管理他人的政府时，最大的困难在于：你必须首先让政府能够控制被统治者，其次要迫使政府控制自身。” +

那么答案是什么呢？要如何创建一个既强大又不会过于强大的政府呢？麦迪逊的答案是：权力分立和制衡。“而且，这种对权力的限制不能从外部强加于政府的各个部门；相反，缺陷必须通过设计政府的内部结构来弥补，这样政府的各个组成部分就能通过彼此之间的关系，使各个部门各安其位。” 所以，政府的不同部门在创建时应确保它们能够相互平衡和制衡彼此的权力。 +

那么这样的政府会是什么样子呢？首先，麦迪逊说：“显然，每个部门都应该有自己的意志，因此，其构成应确保每个部门的成员在任命其他部门成员时尽可能少地施加影响。” 他说每个部门都需要尽可能独立于其他部门的权力，这样它们就不能随意干涉彼此的事务。而且这三个部门的权力基本上需要是平等的。 +

但这里存在一个异议。如果你看一下《宪法》，很明显，相当大一部分权力掌握在立法分支，也就是国会（Congress）手中。而且，这也理应如此，因为国会直接代表人民的声音。所以，如果我们想要在权力方面保持平等，要如何处理这个强大的立法机构呢？你必须对其权力进行分割。“解决这个不便之处的办法是将立法机构分成不同的部门，并且通过不同的选举方式和不同的行动原则，使它们之间的联系尽可能少，当然这要在它们共同的职能性质和对社会的共同依赖所允许的范围内。” +

那么我们要如何防止立法机构权力过大呢？你将其权力一分为二，而这正是《宪法》所做的。国会被分成了一个两院制的立法机构，由众议院（House）和参议院（Senate）组成，它们各自拥有一部分立法权。如果权力的细分让你心跳加速，那么麦迪逊的想法更进一步，他继续分割权力：“在美国这个复合共和制国家，人民交出的权力首先在两个不同的政府之间进行划分，然后分配给每个政府的权力又在不同且独立的部门之间细分。” +

所以，不仅联邦政府的权力在各部门之间进行了划分，而且权力还在国家政府和州政府之间进一步划分，这是一种被称为联邦制（federalism）的治理体系。所以，当权力被分配给这么多不同的行为主体时，自由必然会得到维护，尽管《宪法》赋予联邦政府的权力比《邦联条例》下的联邦政府权力要大。 +

但如果你不相信这种权力划分能让政府权力保持在适当的范围内，《宪法》还提供了一种制衡体系，通过这个体系，每个部门都可以制衡其他部门的权力。例如，行政分支（executive branch）可以通过否决法律来制衡立法分支。立法分支可以通过弹劾和罢免的权力来制衡行政分支。司法分支（judicial branch）可以通过裁定法律和行政行为是否符合宪法来制衡另外两个分支。这些只是几个例子，但关键是每个部门都有权力约束其他部门的权力。 +

在麦迪逊看来，这为人民的自由提供了他所说的双重安全保障。然后，麦迪逊在文章的剩余部分再次讨论了派别（factions）的危险，就像他在《联邦党人文集》第10篇（Federalist 10）中所做的那样。他得出了同样的结论：派别越多，任何一个派别就越难以统治其他派别。所以，对于派别问题，就像政府的权力分立一样，有一个原则始终适用：“必须让野心对抗野心。” 换句话说，我们没有天使来统治我们，我们自己也不是天使。相反，人们和政府总是试图维护自己的利益，而不顾其他人的利益，这意味着鉴于我们堕落的人性，保障自由的最佳办法就是让我们的野心相互对抗。这样一来，暴政就无法得逞，因为要做成任何事情都需要妥协和让步。 +
