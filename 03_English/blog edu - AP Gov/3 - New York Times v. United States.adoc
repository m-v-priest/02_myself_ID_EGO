Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. And this video is time to look at yet another one of your required 必修的 Supreme Court cases for the AP Government curriculum 教学大纲, namely New York Times v. the United States. So if you're ready to get their brain cows milked（幽默表达：开动脑筋）, then let's get to it. +

Okay, so first of all, as always, let's get the facts of the case 案件事实. In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam conflict 越南冲突, which was basically an undeclared war 非正式宣战的战争. And this was not a war that Americans felt great about because the purpose of our involvement was not because we had been attacked or anything like that, but because of this kind of vague geopolitical 地缘政治的 purpose of containing 遏制 the spread of communism 共产主义. As it turned out, despite the magnitude 巨大规模 of the U.S. military, we just weren't able to make much progress against the North Vietnamese. +

So as tens of thousands of American men were dying for a war that Congress didn't even declare, the public grew cynical 愤世嫉俗的，不信任的 about it. But President Johnson and then Richard Nixon just kept telling everyone, "Listen, we've almost won. We just need a few more men and just a little more time. Like, everything is going great." Well, as it turned out, Nixon commissioned 委托 a top secret 极机密的 inquiry into the history of the U.S. involvement in the war, and the findings were not flattering. It showed how presidents and agencies had systematically deceived 欺骗 the public concerning the war. +

And much to Nixon's chagrin 懊恼，烦恼, one of the guys who worked on the report leaked 泄露 huge portions of it to the New York Times and the Washington Post. And newspapers did what newspapers do, and started publishing these damning 令人震惊的，谴责性的 papers which confirmed what everyone suspected — namely, our government is lying to us, and those lies are costing thousands of lives. +

Well, it only took one publication for the Nixon administration to send an order to the papers to cease 停止 publication of top secret documents because it could threaten national security 国家安全. And this was a procedure called prior restraint 事先限制出版. In other words, the Nixon administration tried to keep the paper from publishing these documents before they were printed. And that's how this case wound up before the Supreme Court. +

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake? Well, this is pretty clearly a First Amendment 第一修正案 case, specifically a case about the First Amendment's protection of the freedom of the press 新闻自由. The New York Times claimed that Nixon's invocation 援引 of prior restraint violated 侵犯 their First Amendment rights. The Nixon administration argued that prior restraint was justified in this case because the publication of these papers would threaten national security. +

So what was the decision? Well, the court agreed with the New York Times that the Nixon administration's restraining order 禁令 was unconstitutional 违宪的, and therefore allowed the paper to continue printing the Pentagon Papers 五角大楼文件. And in the opinion 判决书 handed down by the court, they said that, "Any system of prior restraints comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption 强烈假定 against its constitutional validity 合宪性." In other words, whenever a case involving the freedom of the press comes before the court, the bar to clear 标准门槛 for prior restraint is very high. +

Now to be fair, the opinion also made clear that prior restraint can be used if it is really a matter of national security. For example, if a New York Times reporter decided to publish the day and time and landing location of the D-Day invasion 诺曼底登陆, well yeah, you can't do that. Prior restraint is justified in that case. But in this case, Nixon just didn't want to be exposed as a deceitful 狡诈的 turd 粗话，意指令人讨厌的人 who would lie to the American people, and that, my friends, is exactly what the free press is for. +

So why does this case matter? The decision is of course hailed 被誉为 as a victory for the free press against censorship 审查制度. And despite the criticism that it has received for being overly vague on exactly when prior restraint can be invoked 启用, the decision made it very hard to censor the free press ever since. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个最高法院的必学案例，也就是 “《纽约时报》诉美国案”（New York Times v. the United States）。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

好的，首先，和往常一样，我们来了解这个案件的事实。在20世纪60年代末到70年代，美国卷入了越南冲突，这基本上是一场未宣战的战争。美国人对这场战争感觉并不好，因为我们参战的目的不是因为我们受到了攻击之类的原因，而是出于一种模糊的地缘政治目的，即遏制共产主义的传播。结果是，尽管美国军事力量强大，但我们在对抗北越的战争中并没有取得很大进展。 +

所以，当成千上万的美国士兵为一场国会甚至没有宣战的战争而牺牲时，公众对此产生了怀疑。但是约翰逊总统（President Johnson）以及后来的理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）一直告诉大家：“听着，我们几乎就要赢了。我们只需要再多一些士兵和一点时间。瞧，一切都进展得很顺利。” 然而，事实是，尼克松委托进行了一项关于美国参与战争的绝密调查，而调查结果并不乐观。它表明总统和一些机构在这场战争上系统性地欺骗了公众。 +

令尼克松懊恼的是，参与这份报告工作的一个人将报告的大部分内容泄露给了《纽约时报》（New York Times）和《华盛顿邮报》（Washington Post）。而报纸做了它们该做的事，开始发表这些极具说服力的文件，这些文件证实了大家的怀疑，即我们的政府在对我们撒谎，而这些谎言让成千上万的人失去了生命。 +

在报纸发表这些文件后，尼克松政府立即下令这些报纸停止发表这些绝密文件，因为这可能会威胁到国家安全。这是一种被称为事先限制（prior restraint）的程序。换句话说，尼克松政府试图在这些文件被印刷出来之前阻止报纸发表它们。这就是这个案件最终提交到最高法院的原因。 +

那么这个案件所涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？嗯，这显然是一个涉及第一修正案（First Amendment）的案件，具体来说是一个关于第一修正案保护新闻自由的案件。《纽约时报》声称，尼克松政府援引事先限制侵犯了他们的第一修正案权利。尼克松政府则认为，在这个案件中事先限制是合理的，因为发表这些文件会威胁到国家安全。 +

那么裁决是什么呢？嗯，法院支持了《纽约时报》，认为尼克松政府的限制令是违宪的，因此允许报纸继续印刷《五角大楼文件》（Pentagon Papers）。在法院的意见中，他们表示：“任何事先限制的制度在提交到本法院时，都面临着对其合宪性的强烈质疑。” 换句话说，每当涉及新闻自由的案件提交到法院时，事先限制要通过审查的门槛是很高的。 +

公平地说，法院的意见也明确表示，如果真的涉及国家安全，事先限制是可以使用的。例如，如果《纽约时报》的一名记者决定发表诺曼底登陆的日期、时间和登陆地点，那么，是的，这样做是不可以的。在那种情况下，事先限制是合理的。但在这个案件中，尼克松只是不想被曝光为一个对美国人民撒谎的无耻之徒，而朋友们，这正是新闻自由存在的意义。 +

那么这个案件为什么重要呢？这个裁决当然被誉为新闻自由对抗审查制度的一次胜利。尽管这个裁决因为在究竟何时可以援引事先限制的问题上过于模糊而受到批评，但这个裁决使得此后对新闻自由进行审查变得非常困难。 +
