Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're looking at another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 in the AP Government curriculum 课程, and that means it's time to look at Shaw v. Reno 肖诉雷诺案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked gerrymandering 不公正划分选区（为某党派谋利）style, well then let's get to it. +  

Okay, so first -- as always -- let's begin with the facts of the case. Back in 1990, none of North Carolina's representatives were black, and that was a problem because 20% of the state's population was black. So when it was time for reapportionment 重新分配代表名额 after the 1990 census 人口普查, North Carolina drew one district which was majority 多数的 black and then submitted 提交 it to the Justice Department 司法部 for review. And then upon that review, the Justice Department said, "We think you can get a second majority black district if you try real hard." And that's what they did, and the second majority black district came out looking like this. +  

Just in case you don't study the shapes of congressional districts 国会选区 in your spare time, you might not realize that this district is -- to use the technical political science term -- wonky as heck （俚语，非常怪异的）. And when you see a district like that, it's an example of gerrymandering 不公正划分选区. Now if you don't know what that means, let me just give you a quick definition because you have to know it to understand this case. Gerrymandering is when congressional districts are drawn to favor 偏袒 one group over another. +  

Now partisan gerrymandering 党派不公正划分选区 is when districts are drawn to favor one political party over another, and I explained that in another video like this: suppose you have 50 people divided into five districts, and 40% are Republicans and 60% are Democrats. If you draw the districts like this, Democrats will always win these three districts and Republicans will always win these two districts. But if you draw the districts like this, Democrats will win in every district. Either way, more districts will be voting Democrat than Republican. But suppose some wily 诡计多端的 Republican draws the districts like this, then look what happens: Republicans will hold majorities 多数 in three of the districts, and now Democrats only have two. So that's what we call partisan gerrymandering -- where districts are redrawn to favor one party over another. +  

But Shaw v. Reno isn't a case about partisan gerrymandering, but rather racial gerrymandering 种族不公正划分选区, which is when districts are drawn to favor one racial group over another. Now the only reason any of this was an issue is because of a provision 条款 in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 《1965年选举权法案》which said that if certain states change their districts, it must first be approved by the federal government 联邦政府. That's why North Carolina was sending their plan to the Justice Department to begin with. +  

Okay, so what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake? This case was argued on the merits of the Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款 of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案. On one side, those citizens in Shaw's group argue that the Equal Protection Clause was violated 违反 because the districts were drawn only with race in mind. On Reno's side, they argued that the Equal Protection Clause was not violated because these districts were drawn with the intention 意图 of helping black residents who had been the object of historical discrimination 历史歧视. +  

So think about that carefully: some residents are complaining that these districts were drawn for the sole purpose 唯一目的 of electing black representatives to the legislature 立法机构, and that's wrong because the constitution is colorblind 色盲的（喻指无视种族差异的）. And the Justice Department agrees: yes, these districts were drawn to favor one race over another, and that's okay when the race under consideration has been one that has been marginalized 边缘化的 in the past. So the Justice Department isn't arguing with their interpretation 解释: yes, by a strict colorblind reading of the constitution this is wrong, but the argument goes the constitution ought not be colorblind, and we ought to favor the marginalized where we can in order to create a more equitable 公平的 society. +  

Okay, so what was the decision? Well, the court ruled against 作出对…不利的裁决 Reno and the Justice Department, arguing that while these districts may have been drawn with noble intentions 高尚的意图, districts drawn only based on race were unconstitutional 违宪的 because it sets a dangerous precedent 先例. Like if this iteration 迭代 of racial gerrymandering were approved, what's to stop the majority races in power from doing the same? Thus, yes, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment was violated by these strange districts. +  

So that was the decision. Now let's look at why the case matters. Shaw v. Reno set a precedent 开创先例 for future cases involving racial gerrymandering, and to this day districts cannot be drawn only with the intent 意图 to gather those of the same race into voting districts. And this has been challenged 质疑 on several occasions over the years, and the decision still stands. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即“肖诉雷诺案（Shaw v. Reno）”。所以，如果你准备好以“选区划分（gerrymandering）”的方式激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

首先——和往常一样——我们从案件事实开始讲起。早在1990年，北卡罗来纳州（North Carolina）没有任何黑人众议员，这是一个问题，因为该州20%的人口是黑人。因此，在1990年人口普查后重新划分选区时，北卡罗来纳州划出了一个黑人占多数的选区，然后将其提交给司法部（Justice Department）审查。审查后，司法部表示：“我们认为如果你们努力尝试，可以划出第二个黑人占多数的选区。” 于是该州照做了，第二个黑人占多数的选区最终呈现出这样的形状。 +  

如果你在业余时间没有研究过国会选区的形状，你可能不会意识到这个选区——用政治学的专业术语来说——极其古怪。当你看到这样的选区时，这就是“选区划分不公（gerrymandering）”的典型例子。如果你不知道这个词的意思，让我快速给你下一个定义，因为你必须理解它才能明白这个案件。“选区划分不公”指的是在划分国会选区时偏袒某一群体而歧视另一群体。 +  

“党派性选区划分不公（partisan gerrymandering）”是指划分选区以偏袒某一政党。我在另一期类似视频中解释过：假设你有50个人，分成五个选区，其中40%是共和党人，60%是民主党人。如果这样划分选区，民主党人将永远赢得这三个选区，共和党人将永远赢得这两个选区。但如果这样划分选区，民主党人将赢得所有选区。无论哪种方式，民主党人赢得的选区都会比共和党人多。但假设某个狡猾的共和党人这样划分选区，看看会发生什么：共和党人将在三个选区中占据多数，而民主党人只剩下两个选区。这就是我们所说的“党派性选区划分不公”——重新划分选区以偏袒某一政党。 +  

但“肖诉雷诺案”不是关于党派性选区划分不公的案件，而是关于“种族性选区划分不公（racial gerrymandering）”，即划分选区以偏袒某一种族群体。之所以会出现这个问题，唯一的原因是1965年《选举权法案》（Voting Rights Act of 1965）中的一项条款规定，某些州若修改选区，必须首先获得联邦政府的批准。这就是北卡罗来纳州一开始将其选区划分方案提交给司法部的原因。 +  

那么，这里涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？本案围绕第十四修正案（14th Amendment）的平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）展开辩论。一方是肖（Shaw）所在群体的公民，他们认为平等保护条款受到了侵犯，因为划分选区时只考虑了种族因素。另一方是雷诺（Reno）所在的政府方，他们辩称平等保护条款并未受到侵犯，因为划分这些选区的目的是帮助历史上遭受歧视的黑人居民。 +  

仔细想想：一些居民抱怨这些选区的划分纯粹是为了选举黑人众议员，而这是错误的，因为宪法是“色盲”的（即宪法应平等对待所有人，不考虑种族）。司法部则认为：是的，这些选区的划分确实偏袒了某一种族，但当所考虑的种族是过去被边缘化的种族时，这种做法是合理的。因此，司法部并不反对他们的解读：从严格的“色盲”宪法解读来看，这是错误的，但论点在于宪法不应是“色盲”的，我们应该在可能的情况下偏袒被边缘化的群体，以创建一个更公平的社会。 +  

那么，判决结果如何呢？最高法院作出了不利于雷诺和司法部的裁决，认为尽管这些选区的划分可能出于高尚的意图，但仅基于种族划分选区是违宪的，因为这会开创一个危险的先例。例如，如果批准这种种族性选区划分不公，那么当权的多数种族又有什么理由不效仿呢？因此，是的，这些古怪的选区违反了第十四修正案的平等保护条款。 +  

这就是判决结果。现在我们来看看这个案件为何重要。“肖诉雷诺案”为未来涉及种族性选区划分不公的案件开创了先例，直到今天，选区不能仅以聚集同一种族人群进入投票区为目的进行划分。多年来，这一判决在多个场合受到挑战，但该判决仍然有效。 +
