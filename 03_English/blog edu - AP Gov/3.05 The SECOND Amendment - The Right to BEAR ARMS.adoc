Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 3 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video that means it's time to talk about the Second Amendment 第二修正案, which is all about the bang bang and the pew pew. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to accomplish 完成: explain the extent 程度 to which the Supreme Court's interpretation 解释 of the Second Amendment reflects a commitment 承诺 to individual liberty 个人自由. So I probably don't have to tell you that the debate over the interpretation of the Second Amendment can get -- to use the technical jurisprudence 法学；法理学 term -- nasty 激烈的. "From my cold dead hands!" Thanks, Charlton. Anyway, I reckon 认为 we ought to start by considering the language of the amendment itself, and it reads like this: "A well-regulated 管理良好的 militia 民兵 being necessary to the security of a free state 自由州, the right of the people to keep and bear arms 持有和携带武器 shall not be infringed 侵犯." +

So the liberty part comes in that last phrase: "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Now look, that seems pretty straightforward 直截了当的 -- like people have the constitutional 宪法的 right to own guns 拥有枪支. But a lot of the argument over this amendment has to do with 与…有关 those first two phrases: "A well-regulated militia being necessary to a free state." A lot of people in favor of 支持 gun control 枪支管制 have argued that the people's right to keep and bear arms is clearly in the context of 在…背景下 those people's membership in a well-regulated militia. And the truth is, the gun control people have a point 有道理. +

Remember, the Bill of Rights 权利法案 and the amendments they're in did not spring forth 突然出现 from Madison's pen out of nothing. Instead, many state constitutions 州宪法 and bills of rights influenced his composition 创作, and in every case where state constitutions mention the right to bear arms, it is clearly tied to 与…相关 a militia. Now that word "militia" is not going to mean much to us today -- like we grew up in a world where Americans have the largest standing army 常备军 in the world and state police forces 州警察部队 and all of that. But for those in the founding generation 开国一代, there were mighty suspicious of 非常怀疑 standing armies. To them, a standing army was a symbol of tyranny 暴政. Like if a conflict 冲突 arose, they wanted to raise an army 招募军队, and then when the conflict was over to disband it 解散军队 and leave the general protection of the state to individual citizens that made up state militias. +

And so if any given dude 人 in the state could be called up for 被征召 militia duty 民兵任务, then yeah, everyone needed to own a boomstick 枪, and that right -- according to the Constitution -- should not be infringed. However, the main point of contention 争论点 today is this: now that we have such a robust 强大的 military system 军事系统 and police force 警察部队, and thus no need of state militias, does the Second Amendment's right to bear arms still apply 适用? But because the American military has the firepower 火力 of a Greek god, shouldn't we just pass legislation 立法 to keep guns out of the hands of individual citizens? So that's the tension 紧张局面 we face today. +

And if you think the right to bear arms is exclusively 唯一地 tied to militia service 民兵服役, well then here's where I tell you that the Supreme Court does not agree. And to show you what I mean, let's consider two cases where the court ruled on 对…作出裁决 the Second Amendment. The first is the non-required case of District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008. Now remember first of all that the District of Columbia (or Washington D.C.) is a federal district 联邦特区, not a state -- put that in your pocket, we will come back to it in a moment. +

Anyway, the story begins with a guy named Dick Anthony Heller who was a D.C. police officer who wanted to carry his gun home for the purpose of self-defense 自卫. But the problem was that the gun laws in Washington D.C. made it impossible to do such a thing. Like if you wanted to have a gun in your home in D.C., it had to be disassembled 拆卸 or locked down 锁住 with a trigger lock 扳机锁. If you're not that familiar with guns, then all you really need to know is that these regulations 规定 made it so that you could have a gun at home but basically it was useless 无用的. Like if somebody broke into your home, you'd have to be like: "Uh, hold on just a minute, let me find that key to my trigger lock, and the bullets are over here, so just hold on, this is seriously just gonna take another minute, okay, let me just assemble this, and that goes there, and get out my house!" +

So Heller claimed that these strict gun laws were a violation of 违反 his Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms. And in a highly contentious 有争议的 decision, the court agreed with him. Basically the decision was that even though the Second Amendment mentions the right to bear arms in the context of militias, that does not diminish 削弱 the operative phrase 有效语句 of the amendment, namely "the right to keep and bear arms." So in this case, the court very much ruled in favor of 支持 individual liberty. +

But remember, as I said earlier, D.C. is a federal district, not a state, so the ruling 裁决 in the Heller case would only apply there and not to the states. And that means it's time to talk about one of your required cases: McDonald v. Chicago in 2010. Now we're going to talk more about this case in the video on selective incorporation 选择性合并, and I've got a whole video dedicated to 专门讲述 the McDonald case, but for now all you really need to know is that this case essentially 本质上 applied the Heller decision and its commitment to individual liberty for gun ownership 枪支拥有 to all the states. +

So all in all 总而言之, despite the still raging battle 激烈争论 over gun ownership in America, the Supreme Court has consistently 一贯地 upheld 支持 an individual's right to own a gun. But in both cases I mentioned, the decisions were 5-4 and fell along the ideological lines 意识形态路线 of the justices 法官. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第三单元，在这个视频中，这意味着我们要讨论第二修正案，它和枪支相关。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要达成的目标是：解释最高法院对第二修正案的解释在多大程度上反映了对个人自由的承诺。我可能不用告诉你，关于第二修正案的解释的争论可能会变得——用专业的法学词汇来说——激烈。“从我的冷僵的手中夺走（枪支）！” 谢谢，查尔顿（Charlton）。不管怎样，我认为我们应该从考虑修正案本身的措辞开始，它是这样写的：“一支管理良好的民兵队伍对于一个自由州的安全是必要的，人民持有和携带武器的权利不得侵犯。” +

所以自由的部分体现在最后一句话：“人民持有和携带武器的权利不得侵犯。” 现在看，这似乎相当直接——就像人们拥有拥有枪支的宪法权利。但关于这个修正案的很多争论都与前两句话有关：“一支管理良好的民兵队伍对于一个自由州的安全是必要的。” 很多支持枪支管制的人认为，人民持有和携带武器的权利显然是在他们作为一支管理良好的民兵队伍成员的背景下的。而事实是，支持枪支管制的人有一定道理。 +

记住，《权利法案》以及其中的修正案不是麦迪逊凭空写出来的。相反，许多州宪法和权利法案影响了他的创作，并且在每个州宪法提及携带武器权利的情况中，它明显与民兵组织相关。现在 “民兵” 这个词对我们今天的人来说意义不大——因为我们成长于一个美国拥有世界上最庞大的常备军以及州警察部队等等的世界。但对于建国那一代人来说，他们对常备军非常怀疑。对他们来说，常备军是暴政的象征。就像如果发生冲突，他们希望组建一支军队，然后当冲突结束时解散它，并将州的总体保护交给组成州民兵的公民个人。 +

所以如果该州的任何一个人都可能被征召履行民兵职责，那么是的，每个人都需要拥有一把枪，并且根据宪法，这项权利不应被侵犯。然而，如今的主要争议点是：既然我们有如此强大的军事系统和警察部队，因此不需要州民兵了，第二修正案中携带武器的权利仍然适用吗？但是因为美国军队拥有强大的火力，难道我们不应该通过立法让枪支远离公民个人吗？所以这就是我们如今面临的矛盾。 +

如果你认为携带武器的权利仅仅与民兵服役相关，好吧，那我告诉你，最高法院可不这么认为。为了说明我的意思，让我们考虑两个最高法院对第二修正案做出裁决的案例。第一个是2008年的 “哥伦比亚特区诉海勒案”（District of Columbia v. Heller），这不是必学案例。首先要记住，哥伦比亚特区（District of Columbia，也就是华盛顿特区（Washington D.C.））是一个联邦特区，而不是一个州——记住这一点，我们稍后会再提到它。 +

不管怎样，故事是这样的，一个叫迪克·安东尼·海勒（Dick Anthony Heller）的人是华盛顿特区的一名警察，他想把枪带回家用于自卫。但问题是华盛顿特区的枪支法律不允许他这么做。就好比如果你想在华盛顿特区的家中拥有一把枪，它必须被拆解或者用扳机锁锁起来。如果你对枪支不太熟悉，那么你只需要知道这些规定使得你虽然可以在家中拥有一把枪，但基本上它毫无用处。就像如果有人闯入你的家，你可能会这样：“呃，等一下，让我找到扳机锁的钥匙，子弹在这边，所以等一下，这真的还得花点时间，好的，让我把枪组装起来，把这个装到这儿，然后滚出我的家！” +

所以海勒声称这些严格的枪支法律侵犯了他根据第二修正案持有和携带武器的权利。在一项极具争议的裁决中，法院同意了他的观点。基本上，裁决认为，即使第二修正案在民兵组织的背景下提及携带武器的权利，但这并没有削弱修正案中 “持有和携带武器的权利” 这一关键表述。所以在这个案件中，法院非常支持个人自由。 +

但记住，就像我之前说的，哥伦比亚特区是一个联邦特区，而不是一个州，所以 “海勒案” 的裁决只在那里适用，不适用于各州。这意味着我们要讨论一个必学案例：2010年的 “麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案”（McDonald v. Chicago）。我们将在关于选择性合并的视频中更深入地讨论这个案件，我也有一个专门关于 “麦克唐纳案” 的完整视频，但现在你只需要知道，这个案件基本上将 “海勒案” 的裁决以及其对个人拥有枪支自由的支持应用到了所有州。 +

所以总的来说，尽管在美国关于枪支拥有的争论仍在激烈进行，最高法院一直支持个人拥有枪支的权利。但在我提到的这两个案件中，裁决都是以5比4通过的，并且是基于大法官们的意识形态分歧。 +
