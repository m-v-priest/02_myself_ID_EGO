hey there and welcome back to heimler's history. in this video we're looking at another one of your required supreme court cases 最高法院案例 in the ap government curriculum 课程, and that means it's time to look at mcculloch versus maryland 麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milk supremacy style （以体现至高权力的方式获取知识）, then let's get to it. +

okay first let's get the facts of the case. in 1816, congress chartered 特许设立 the second bank of the united states, which in case you can't discern 辨别；识别 from the name was a federal bank 联邦银行. furthermore 此外, this federal bank attempted to establish branches 设立分行 in several states including baltimore, maryland, to which the maryland legislature 马里兰州立法机构 said big mistake. so maryland was not too pleased 满意 to have this branch of the federal bank in its borders 境内, and so the state legislature passed a law saying that any bank in maryland which was not officially chartered by maryland would be subject to 受……支配；须缴纳 a 15,000 a year tax, which when being adjusted for inflation 考虑通货膨胀因素调整后 is roughly a metric buttload of money （大量的钱，口语化表达）. +

so the cashier 出纳员 of the baltimore branch of the national bank could see the injustice 不公正 in this tax and refused to pay it, and the case went all the way up to the supreme court 案件一路上诉至最高法院. so now let's have a look at the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中；攸关 in this case. maryland argued that the establishment of a national bank was unconstitutional 违宪的 because nowhere in article 1 section 8 did it say that congress had the power to create a bank, and on that count 关于那一点 they were right -- it doesn't say anything about that. but mcculloch's lawyers argued that the bank was constitutional on account of 因为 the necessary and proper clause 必要且适当条款, which was explicitly stated 明确表述 in article 1 section 8, and it says this: "the congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states, or in any department or officer thereof." +

in other words, congress is given explicit powers 明确权力 in article 1 section 8 -- like the power to declare war 宣战 or regulate interstate commerce 监管州际贸易 for example -- and the necessary and proper clause gives congress the power to create other laws which are not explicitly named 明确提及 in article 1 section 8 but that need to be passed in order that the explicit powers can be upheld 维护. if you want a term for those kinds of non-explicit powers 非明确权力 -- and i know you do -- these are called implied powers 默示权力: the powers are not named but they are implied 隐含的；暗示的. +

so what was the decision? well it doesn't appear that there was much of a fight over this one since the decision was unanimous 一致同意的 in favor of mcculloch. chief justice 首席大法官 john marshall argued in his decision that the bank was in fact constitutional on account of the authority of the necessary and proper clause, and he said it this way: "we think that the sound construction 合理解释 of the constitution must allow to the national legislature that discretion 自由裁量权 with respect to the means by which the powers it confers 授予 are to be carried into execution 执行, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it in the manner most beneficial to the people. let the end be legitimate 合法的, let it be within the scope of the constitution 在宪法范围内, and all means which are appropriate 适当的, which are plainly adapted to that end 明显适用于该目的, which are not prohibited 禁止 but consist with 符合 the letter and the spirit of the constitution, are constitutional." +

in other words, if a power is not prohibited by the constitution and the law in question upholds the spirit of the constitution, then it stands 成立；有效. furthermore, this case established the supremacy 至高无上；最高权威 of national laws over against state laws 国家法律高于州法律, and listen to how marshall says it: "the powers granted to congress are not given by the people of a single state. they are given by the people of the united states to a government whose laws, made in pursuance of the constitution 依据宪法制定, are declared to be supreme. consequently, the people of a single state cannot confer sovereignty 授予主权 which will extend over them." in other words, whenever a state law is in conflict with 与……冲突 a federal law, federal law wins. +

so why does this decision matter? well it matters mostly because of what it demonstrated about federalism 联邦制 -- the balance of power 权力平衡 between the federal government and the states. remember that in the united states versus lopez 美国诉洛佩兹案, the court tipped the balance in favor of the states 使权力天平向州倾斜. in this case, the balance is decidedly 明确地 tipped in favor of the federal government, and ever since this decision was handed down 作出裁决, mcculloch vs maryland has been a precedent 先例 to which later courts would return when deciding on the balance of power between states and the federal government. +

okay that's what you need to know about mcculloch versus maryland for ap government. here's a playlist 播放列表 right over here for all the other required cases in case you're into that kind of thing. if you want help getting an a in your class and a five on your exam in may, then you can click right here and grab my review packet 复习资料包. so go ahead and subscribe if you're not already, and i will see you in the next one. heimler out. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课（Heimler's History）。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程政府学（AP Government）中另一个必修的最高法院案例，这意味着我们要看看“麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案”（Mcculloch versus Maryland）。所以，如果你准备好以“至高权力”的方式汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

好的，首先让我们了解一下这个案件的事实。1816年，国会特许成立了美国第二银行（the second bank of the United States），从名字就能看出这是一家联邦银行。此外，这家联邦银行试图在包括马里兰州巴尔的摩（Baltimore, Maryland）在内的几个州设立分行，马里兰州立法机构认为这是个大错误。所以，马里兰州对于这家联邦银行在其境内设立分行不太满意，于是州立法机构通过了一项法律，规定任何在马里兰州的银行，如果不是由马里兰州正式特许成立的，都要缴纳每年15000美元的税，考虑到通货膨胀，这可是一大笔钱。 +

所以，这家国家银行巴尔的摩分行的出纳员认为这项税收不公正，拒绝缴纳，这个案件一路上诉到了最高法院。现在让我们看看这个案件所涉及的宪法原则。马里兰州辩称，设立国家银行是违宪的，因为宪法第一条第八款中没有任何地方表明国会有权设立银行，在这一点上他们是对的——宪法确实没有提及这一点。但是麦卡洛克（Mcculloch）的律师认为，根据宪法第一条第八款中明确规定的“必要和适当条款”，这家银行是符合宪法的，该条款内容如下：“国会有权制定一切必要和适当的法律，以执行上述权力以及宪法赋予美国政府或其任何部门或官员的所有其他权力。” +

换句话说，宪法第一条第八款赋予了国会明确的权力——比如宣战权或管理州际贸易的权力——而“必要和适当条款”赋予国会权力去制定那些在第一条第八款中没有明确列出，但为了维护明确权力而需要通过的其他法律。如果你想要一个术语来描述这些非明确的权力——我知道你想知道——这些被称为“隐含权力”：这些权力没有被明确命名，但它们是隐含的。 +

那么判决结果是什么呢？嗯，这个案件似乎没有太多争议，因为判决是一致支持麦卡洛克的。首席大法官约翰·马歇尔（John Marshall）在判决中认为，基于“必要和适当条款”的权力，这家银行实际上是符合宪法的，他是这样说的：“我们认为，对宪法的合理解释必须允许国家立法机构在执行赋予它的权力的手段方面拥有自由裁量权，这将使立法机构能够以对人民最有利的方式履行赋予它的崇高职责。只要目的是合法的，且在宪法的范围内，所有适当的、明显适用于该目的的、未被禁止且符合宪法文字和精神的手段，都是符合宪法的。” +

换句话说，如果一项权力没有被宪法禁止，并且所涉及的法律维护了宪法的精神，那么这项权力就是有效的。此外，这个案件确立了国家法律高于州法律的地位，听听马歇尔是怎么说的：“授予国会的权力不是由单个州的人民赋予的。它们是由美国人民赋予一个政府的，根据宪法制定的该政府的法律被宣布为至高无上的。因此，单个州的人民不能赋予延伸到他们身上的主权。” 换句话说，每当州法律与联邦法律发生冲突时，联邦法律占上风。 +

那么这个判决为什么重要呢？嗯，主要是因为它展示了联邦制——联邦政府和各州之间的权力平衡。记住，在“美国诉洛佩兹案”（United States versus Lopez）中，法院的判决倾向于各州。在这个案件中，权力平衡明显倾向于联邦政府，自从这个判决下达以来，“麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案”成为了后来法院在决定州和联邦政府之间的权力平衡时会参考的先例。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的美国大学预修课程政府学中“麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案”的内容。如果你对这类案件感兴趣，这里有一个包含所有其他必修案例的播放列表。如果你想在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分，那么你可以点击这里获取我的复习资料包。所以，如果你还没有订阅，请订阅，我们在下一个视频中再见。海姆勒（Heimler）退场。 +

hey there and welcome back to heimler's history. in this video we're looking at another one of your required supreme court cases in the ap government curriculum, and that means it's time to look at mcculloch versus maryland. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milk supremacy style, then let's get to it.

okay first let's get the facts of the case. in 1816, congress chartered the second bank of the united states, which in case you can't discern from the name was a federal bank. furthermore, this federal bank attempted to establish branches in several states including baltimore, maryland, to which the maryland legislature said big mistake. so maryland was not too pleased to have this branch of the federal bank in its borders, and so the state legislature passed a law saying that any bank in maryland which was not officially chartered by maryland would be subject to a 15,000 a year tax, which when being adjusted for inflation is roughly a metric buttload of money.

so the cashier of the baltimore branch of the national bank could see the injustice in this tax and refused to pay it, and the case went all the way up to the supreme court. so now let's have a look at the constitutional principle at stake in this case. maryland argued that the establishment of a national bank was unconstitutional because nowhere in article 1 section 8 did it say that congress had the power to create a bank, and on that count they were right -- it doesn't say anything about that. but mcculloch's lawyers argued that the bank was constitutional on account of the necessary and proper clause, which was explicitly stated in article 1 section 8, and it says this: "the congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states, or in any department or officer thereof."

in other words, congress is given explicit powers in article 1 section 8 -- like the power to declare war or regulate interstate commerce for example -- and the necessary and proper clause gives congress the power to create other laws which are not explicitly named in article 1 section 8 but that need to be passed in order that the explicit powers can be upheld. if you want a term for those kinds of non-explicit powers -- and i know you do -- these are called implied powers: the powers are not named but they are implied.

so what was the decision? well it doesn't appear that there was much of a fight over this one since the decision was unanimous in favor of mcculloch. chief justice john marshall argued in his decision that the bank was in fact constitutional on account of the authority of the necessary and proper clause, and he said it this way: "we think that the sound construction of the constitution must allow to the national legislature that discretion with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it in the manner most beneficial to the people. let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited but consist with the letter and the spirit of the constitution, are constitutional."

in other words, if a power is not prohibited by the constitution and the law in question upholds the spirit of the constitution, then it stands. furthermore, this case established the supremacy of national laws over against state laws, and listen to how marshall says it: "the powers granted to congress are not given by the people of a single state. they are given by the people of the united states to a government whose laws, made in pursuance of the constitution, are declared to be supreme. consequently, the people of a single state cannot confer sovereignty which will extend over them." in other words, whenever a state law is in conflict with a federal law, federal law wins.
