Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History, and furthermore welcome to the first video covering Unit 5 of the AP Government curriculum 课程. This unit is all about how we the people participate in politics 参与政治, so let's begin by talking about who gets to vote and the kinds of internal commitments 内在因素 that shape how we vote. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: describe the voting rights protections 投票权保护 in the constitution 宪法 and in legislation 法律, and then second, describe different models of voting behavior 投票行为模式. So first, let's begin by considering who in America has the right to vote, and the word for that is the franchise 选举权；投票权. And for that, let's start with the constitution. +

In Article 1, Section 4, it says this about voting: "The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed 规定 in each state by the legislature thereof, but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulation." In other words, the constitution doesn't say who has the right to vote and who does not -- that was the decision left up to 留给 the state. And in 1789 when the new constitution became the governing document  governing document of our land, the states had decided that only white men who owned property 拥有财产 were eligible to vote 有资格投票. And just in case 以防 your knowledge of late 18th century American demographics 人口统计数据 is shaky 不稳固的, let me just tell you that this group of people was a minority 少数群体. So in the beginning, the only members of society to have the franchise were wealthy, landed white men who are a small minority of the population. +

Now I know that sounds very un-American to us, but the reason states did it that way is because they believed men with property were the only ones who had a true stake in 真正利益相关 the betterment of society 社会改善 -- like they actually owned a piece of it -- and thus the reasoning went that they would vote in the interests of society as a whole 从社会整体利益出发投票. Now all the other non-landed folks 没有土地的人 in America apparently did not agree, and by 1830, specifically under pressure from self-styled 自称为 man of the people Andrew Jackson, the franchise was extended to 扩大到 all white men, landed or not. Much of this pressure actually came from the west, since as people pushed westward 向西迁移 and established their territorial governments 地方政府, they more often than not 通常 open voting to more people than did the established states in the east. So going into the Civil War 内战, all white men could vote. +

Now remember what we read in Article 1, Section 4, namely that determining who gets to vote was left to the states, but also congress was able to admit more citizens into the franchise when it seemed fitting 合适的. Well after the Civil War through about 1971, a series of constitutional amendments 宪法修正案 recognize 承认 the right to vote for more and more citizens, and you need to know these amendments. So let's have a look at them real quick. +

First is the 15th Amendment 第十五修正案 which recognized the right of black men to vote. Second was the 17th Amendment 第十七修正案 which granted 授予 the people the right to vote senators into office 选举参议员任职 -- remember according to the constitution senators were voted in by state legislatures 州立法机构, so this amendment didn't necessarily give more people voting rights but it did expand the opportunity for political participation 政治参与机会. Third is the 19th Amendment 第十九修正案 which recognized women's right to vote. Fourth is the 24th Amendment 第二十四修正案 which abolished 废除 poll taxes 人头税, which was the method of voter suppression 选民压制手段 some states used to suppress the votes of minorities 压制少数族裔投票 -- so again this amendment didn't give additional groups access to the voting booth 投票站 but it did tear down barriers to political participation 消除政治参与障碍. And finally, the 26th Amendment 第二十六修正案 lowered the voting age from 21 down to 18. +

So at this point, basically everyone in America regardless of race, ethnicity 种族, sex, or socioeconomic status 社会经济地位 can vote in our elections. But there are two caveats 警告；限制条件 to that statement. First is that even though constitutionally the franchise is extended to all, some states still erect barriers to voting 设立投票障碍. There aren't poll taxes or literacy tests 识字测试 anymore, but some states do make it harder for certain groups to vote. Those laws are constantly being challenged in courts 受到法庭质疑, and sometimes they are struck down 废除 while other times they're allowed to remain. The second caveat is that some states have enacted laws 制定法律 limiting certain groups from voting -- for example, some states have laws banning convicted felons 重刑犯 from voting. +

Okay, now that we've established who can vote, let's look at the four ways that inform the way people vote 影响人们投票方式. The first model for voting behavior is called rational choice voting 理性选择投票. This is when a person votes based on their individual self-interest 个人利益 and who has carefully studied the issues and platforms 议题和竞选纲领. In other words, they have studied the issues and the candidates carefully and they make a rational choice 理性选择. +

The second model for voting behavior is retrospective voting 回顾性投票. This is when a person votes based on the recent past track record 过往表现 of the politician in question 相关政客. They asked themselves a very simple question: was this politician a turd （俚语：无用之人） or not? And if in recent memory the politician has not been a turd, then the retrospective voter votes that person back into office 投票让其连任. +

The third model for voting behavior is prospective voting 前瞻性投票. This is when a person votes based on the predictions of how a party or candidate will perform in the future 政党或候选人未来表现. So it's the opposite of retrospective voting, but still this kind of voter asks a similar question to the retrospective voter, but instead of asking "was this politician a turd?" they ask "will this politician be a turd?" In order to make this assessment 评估, the voter considers how the candidates' campaign promises 竞选承诺 or proposed ballot initiatives 拟议的投票提案 will affect their lives after the election. +

And the fourth model for voting behavior is party line voting 党派路线投票. This is when a person votes for all the candidates of a voter's party. "I'm a Republican 共和党人 and all these people are Republicans so I'm gonna vote for them." "I'm a Democrat 民主党人 and all these people are Democrats so let's vote for them." Well that was easy, and now we've got time to celebrate at Golden Corral. +

Look, I don't care what model of voting describes you -- if you want to vote for me to keep making these videos for you, then click that subscribe button 订阅按钮 and I shall oblige 照办. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道，此外欢迎来到美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程第五单元的第一个视频。这个单元全是关于我们人民如何参与政治的内容，所以我们先来说说谁有投票权，以及那些影响我们如何投票的内在因素。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那么我们就开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：描述宪法和立法中对投票权的保护，其次，描述不同的投票行为模式。所以首先，我们来考虑一下在美国谁有投票权，这个权利被称为选举权（franchise）。为此，我们从宪法开始说起。 +

在宪法第一条第四款中，关于投票是这样说的：“选举参议员和众议员的时间、地点和方式应由各州立法机构规定，但国会可随时通过法律制定或更改此类规定。” 换句话说，宪法没有规定谁有投票权，谁没有投票权 —— 这一决定留给了各州。在1789年，当新宪法成为我们国家的治理文件时，各州规定只有拥有财产的白人男性才有资格投票。万一你对18世纪后期美国的人口统计情况不太了解，我告诉你，这群人在当时是少数群体。所以一开始，社会中只有拥有财产的富裕白人男性享有选举权，而他们只是人口中的一小部分。 +

现在我知道这听起来对我们来说很不 “美国”，但各州这样做的原因是他们认为拥有财产的男性是唯一真正与社会改善利害相关的人 —— 因为他们实际上拥有社会的一部分 —— 因此他们的理由是这些人会为了社会整体的利益而投票。现在，美国所有其他没有财产的人显然不同意这种做法，到了1830年，特别是在自称为人民代言人的安德鲁·杰克逊（Andrew Jackson）的压力下，选举权被扩大到所有白人男性，无论他们是否拥有财产。实际上，很大一部分压力来自西部，因为随着人们向西推进并建立地方政府，他们比东部的既有州更倾向于让更多人拥有投票权。所以在内战前，所有白人男性都可以投票。 +

现在记住我们在宪法第一条第四款中读到的内容，即决定谁有投票权留给了各州，但国会在认为合适的时候也能够让更多公民享有选举权。在内战后到1971年左右，一系列宪法修正案承认了越来越多公民的投票权，你需要了解这些修正案。所以让我们快速看一下这些修正案。 +

首先是第十五条修正案，它承认了黑人男性的投票权。其次是第十七条修正案，它赋予人民选举参议员的权利 —— 记住，根据宪法，参议员是由州立法机构选出的，所以这个修正案不一定是给予更多人投票权，但它确实扩大了政治参与的机会。第三是第十九条修正案，它承认了女性的投票权。第四是第二十四条修正案，它废除了人头税，人头税是一些州用来压制少数群体投票的手段 —— 所以这个修正案同样不是给予更多群体投票的机会，而是消除了政治参与的障碍。最后，第二十六条修正案将投票年龄从21岁降低到18岁。 +

所以在这一点上，基本上美国的每个人，无论种族、民族、性别或社会经济地位如何，都可以在选举中投票。但这个说法有两个注意事项。首先，即使在宪法上选举权扩大到了所有人，一些州仍然设置了投票障碍。现在已经没有人头税或识字测试了，但一些州确实让某些群体投票变得更加困难。这些法律不断在法庭上受到挑战，有时会被推翻，有时则被允许保留。第二个注意事项是，一些州制定了限制某些群体投票的法律 —— 例如，一些州有法律禁止被定罪的重罪犯投票。 +

好的，既然我们已经确定了谁可以投票，让我们来看看影响人们投票方式的四种模式。第一种投票行为模式被称为理性选择投票（rational choice voting）。这是指一个人基于自身利益，并仔细研究了相关问题和候选人纲领后进行投票。换句话说，他们仔细研究了问题和候选人，然后做出理性的选择。 +

第二种投票行为模式是回顾性投票（retrospective voting）。这是指一个人基于某个政治人物近期的过往表现来投票。他们会问自己一个非常简单的问题：这个政治人物是不是很糟糕？如果在近期的记忆中，这个政治人物表现不错，那么回顾性投票者就会投票让这个人再次当选。 +

第三种投票行为模式是前瞻性投票（prospective voting）。这是指一个人基于对一个政党或候选人未来表现的预测来投票。所以这与回顾性投票相反，但这种投票者会问一个与回顾性投票者类似的问题，不过不是问 “这个政治人物是不是很糟糕？”，而是问 “这个政治人物将来会不会很糟糕？” 为了做出这个评估，投票者会考虑候选人的竞选承诺或提议的选票倡议在选举后会如何影响他们的生活。 +

第四种投票行为模式是党派路线投票（party line voting）。这是指一个人投票给他们所属党派的所有候选人。“我是共和党人，这些人都是共和党人，所以我要投票给他们。” “我是民主党人，这些人都是民主党人，所以我要投票给他们。” 嗯，很简单，现在我们有时间去金珊瑚餐厅（Golden Corral）庆祝一下了。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取复习资料包，这将帮助你在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分。听着，我不在乎哪种投票模式符合你 —— 如果你希望我继续为你制作这些视频，那么点击订阅按钮，我会照办的。
