Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now I've been going through Unit 5 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video it's time to talk about interest groups 利益集团 and their influence on public policy 公共政策. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked iron triangle 铁三角 style, well then let's get to it. +

Here's what we're trying to do in this video: explain the benefits and potential problems of interest group influence on elections and policy making 政策制定, and secondly, explain how variation in types and resources of interest groups affects their ability to influence elections in policy making. So we talked about interest groups lo those many months ago in Unit 2, so I reckon 认为 a definition is in order 有必要 because let's be honest, you probably forgot by now what they are. +

An interest group 利益集团 is a group of people who gather around a policy issue 政策问题 in order to persuade policymakers 政策制定者 to pass legislation favorable to the group 通过对该集团有利的立法. There's an interest group for dang near 几乎 everything. There's the NRA (National Rifle Association 全国步枪协会) for people who are excited about guns, there's the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 全国有色人种协进会) for people who want to fight for black rights, there's PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 善待动物组织) for people who want to fight for animal rights, and there are more generalized groups like the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons 美国退休人员协会) which advocates for 倡导 the varied interests of retired people. And I can go on and on, but the point is these are usually very narrow interest -- not necessarily, but a lot of times they are very narrow in their interest. +

And now let's talk about the four major reasons that interest groups exist. First, interest groups educate voters and office holders 公职人员 on the interest group's chosen issue. You could take all the individual interests Americans care about and put them on a scale -- it would weigh a metric butt load （俚语：大量）. Although we're on the street, it is rapidly approaching two metric buttloads. The point is there are way more issues that people care about than the voting population or elected officials could possibly research and develop expertise on. But do you know who can become experts on those individual issues? I hope you said interest groups, because that's you know literally what this whole video is about. Yes, it's interest groups. One of their main jobs is to educate. +

Like for example, did you know that there's an interest group for balloon enthusiasts 气球爱好者? Oh yes there is. In fact, in 2012 the Balloon Council 气球委员会 spent $60,000 to educate the public on the helium crisis 氦气危机 in America. Now part of that money was spent to educate the public, and the other part was spent to do the next thing I want to tell you about. +

The second thing interest groups do is engage in lobbying 游说, which just means that they hold meetings with policymakers to try to influence them to pass legislation in their favor 通过对自己有利的立法. And just for poops and giggles （俚语：只是为了好玩）, let's keep talking about the balloon lobby because you know it makes me happy. After the helium crisis passed -- I know you think I'm making this up, this is real okay, this is real -- after the helium crisis passed, balloon sellers were filling their balloons to their heart's content 心满意足地, and a few states started passing anti-balloon laws 反气球法. These were mainly environmental regulations 环境法规. Like in case you didn't know, when a balloon gets released into the sky it doesn't go to heaven to adorn the throne of God world without end -- no, they usually end up in the ocean. And a few years ago environmentalists started finding birds tangled up in balloon strings 被气球绳缠住的鸟 and dead whales with balloon trash in their stomach. And so states started passing anti-balloon laws. Well, the Balloon Council, furious at this example of gross government overreach 政府过度干预, lobbied state legislatures 州立法机构 hard. And you know what? They were successful. There are only five states now that have anti-balloon laws on the books 记录在案 thanks to the tireless lobbying efforts of the balloon lobby. +

Anyway, because many interest groups form around a single issue, these lobbyists 游说者 are often policy experts who can help policymakers understand the impact of certain legislation. Okay, so let's leave the Balloon Council behind and talk about the third thing interest groups do, and that is draft legislation 起草立法. So because interest groups are experts in their areas, many of them hire staff to draft policy proposals 起草政策提案 for legislators 立法者 to consider. Like if you want a bill that upholds the rights of balloon enthusiasts everywhere, here's what it would look like. Oh I said I would stop but it is just too tasty. It is too tasty. There is a balloon lobby. All right, maybe a better known interest group like the National Rifle Association 全国步枪协会 is a better example. Their policy experts and staffers could draft a bill protecting gun rights and present it to sympathetic legislators 有同感的立法者 in hopes that they will introduce it and have it passed. +

Okay, the fourth thing interest groups do is to mobilize 动员 their members to apply pressure on and work with legislators and government agencies 政府机构. So the interest group might ask its members to email their representatives when a bill comes up for a vote 进行投票, or maybe they plan a demonstration of some kind in order to get some media attention 媒体关注. +

Okay, now that we've seen what interest groups are and what they aim to do, let's look at one of the major ways that they do their work. If you remember back to Unit 2, I told you that interest groups were one point on what's known as an iron triangle 铁三角. This is a term to describe the strong mutually beneficial relationship 强互利关系 between interest groups, congressional committees 国会委员会, and government agencies. Members of congressional committees are especially helped by interest groups who both provide them with policy information and provide no small amount of campaign donations 竞选捐款 if the representative is sympathetic to the group's goals. +

And interest groups can also become part of issue networks 议题网络, which is when many different interest groups and even entities outside of interest groups come together to achieve a short-term policy goal 短期政策目标. For example, a couple years ago there was a big push from a lot of different groups that had come together into an informal issue network to oppose government subsidies 政府补贴 of tobacco farmers 烟农. There have been policies granting tobacco farmers federal funds 联邦资金 since the 1930s, and over the last decade there was a growing movement to shut that down. Okay, so those are issue networks. +

Now let's turn the corner 转而 and talk about the factors that could either hinder 阻碍 or help an interest group achieve its goal. First, an interest group's activity can be influenced by inequality of political and economic resources 政治和经济资源的不平等. Because one of the most significant things an interest group can do for policymakers is to help fund their campaigns, then policymakers are much more incentivized 激励 to take meetings with the well-funded interest groups 资金充足的利益集团. For example, big groups like the NRA and the AARP have buttloads of scratch （俚语：大量的钱）, and so everyone wants to hear from them. +

The same reality also has an effect on the second factor influencing the efficacy 效力 of interest groups, namely unequal access to decision makers 接触决策者的机会不平等. Again, the interest groups with small amounts of funding and smaller memberships 成员数量较少 will have a harder time bending the ear of a policy maker 说服政策制定者. +

The third factor influencing how well interest groups can do their jobs is the free rider problem 搭便车问题. This is when a larger group benefits from the efforts of the interest group than are members of the group -- like the members are paying the bills, but their proposed legislation might help a lot more people than those in the group. Think about the AARP again which lobbies on behalf of 代表 retired persons. Now clearly not every retired person in America is a member of that group, but if the AARP is successful in lobbying and getting favorable legislation passed, then who benefits from all that? It's all retired people. So there are a lot more people benefiting from that legislation than the ones who actually did the work of getting it passed. And that is the free rider problem. +

== 中文释义


嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。目前我一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第五单元，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈利益集团以及它们对公共政策的影响。所以，如果你准备好以 “铁三角” 的方式激发自己的思维，那么我们就开始吧。 +

在这个视频中我们要做的是：解释利益集团对选举和政策制定产生的影响所带来的好处和潜在问题，其次，解释利益集团在类型和资源方面的差异如何影响它们在政策制定中对选举施加影响的能力。几个月前在第二单元我们谈到过利益集团，所以我觉得有必要给它下个定义，因为说实话，你可能现在已经忘了利益集团是什么。 +

利益集团是一群人围绕某个政策问题聚集在一起，目的是说服政策制定者通过对该集团有利的立法。几乎每个方面都有对应的利益集团。有全国步枪协会（NRA）代表那些对枪支感兴趣的人，有全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）为争取黑人权利的人发声，有善待动物组织（PETA）为争取动物权利的人努力，还有像美国退休人员协会（AARP）这样更具普遍性的团体，它为退休人员的各种利益代言。我可以一直说下去，但重点是这些利益集团的利益范围通常非常狭窄 —— 不一定都这样，但很多时候是这样的。 +

现在让我们谈谈利益集团存在的四个主要原因。第一，利益集团会就该集团所关注的问题对选民和公职人员进行教育。你可以把所有美国人关心的个人利益放在一个天平上衡量 —— 那分量可重了。虽然我说的有点夸张，但情况差不多是这样。重点是人们关心的问题太多了，选民或当选官员不可能对所有问题都进行研究并成为相关领域的专家。但你知道谁能成为这些个别问题的专家吗？我希望你能说 “利益集团”，因为这正是这个视频要讲的内容。没错，就是利益集团。它们的主要工作之一就是进行教育。 +

举个例子，你知道有一个为气球爱好者成立的利益集团吗？哦，确实有。事实上，在2012年，气球协会花了6万美元就美国的氦气危机对公众进行教育。这笔钱一部分用于教育公众，另一部分用于我接下来要告诉你的事情。 +

利益集团做的第二件事是进行游说，也就是说它们会与政策制定者举行会议，试图影响他们通过对自己有利的立法。只是为了找点乐子，我们继续说说气球游说团体，因为这让我很开心。在氦气危机过去之后 —— 我知道你觉得我在瞎编，但这是真的，这是真的 —— 在氦气危机过去之后，气球销售商尽情地给气球充气，一些州开始通过反气球法案。这些主要是环境法规。你可能不知道，当一个气球被释放到天空中，它不会直接升上天堂去装点上帝的宝座 —— 不，它们通常最终会掉进海洋里。几年前，环保主义者开始发现鸟类被气球线缠住，还有死鲸鱼的肚子里有气球垃圾。于是一些州开始通过反气球法案。嗯，气球协会对政府这种过度干预的例子感到愤怒，于是大力游说州立法机构。你猜怎么着？他们成功了。由于气球游说团体不知疲倦的游说努力，现在只有五个州有反气球法案。 +

不管怎样，因为许多利益集团是围绕单一问题成立的，这些游说者往往是政策专家，他们可以帮助政策制定者理解某些立法的影响。好的，那我们先把气球协会放一边，来谈谈利益集团做的第三件事，那就是起草立法。因为利益集团是其所在领域的专家，许多利益集团会雇佣员工为立法者起草政策提案供他们考虑。比如说，如果你想要一项维护各地气球爱好者权利的法案，大概就是这样的情况。哦，我说过我会停下来的，但这个例子太有趣了。真的很有趣。确实有一个气球游说团体。好吧，也许像全国步枪协会这样更知名的利益集团是个更好的例子。他们的政策专家和工作人员可以起草一项保护持枪权利的法案，并将其提交给有同情心的立法者，希望他们能提出并通过该法案。 +

好的，利益集团做的第四件事是动员其成员对立法者和政府机构施加压力并与之合作。所以利益集团可能会要求其成员在一项法案进行投票时给他们的代表发电子邮件，或者他们可能会策划某种示威活动以引起媒体关注。 +

好的，现在我们已经了解了利益集团是什么以及它们的目标是什么，让我们看看它们开展工作的一个主要方式。如果你还记得第二单元的内容，我告诉过你利益集团是所谓 “铁三角” 中的一个点。“铁三角” 这个术语用来描述利益集团、国会委员会和政府机构之间强大的互利关系。国会委员会的成员尤其得到利益集团的帮助，利益集团既为他们提供政策信息，如果众议员支持该集团的目标，利益集团还会提供大量的竞选捐款。 +

而且利益集团还可以成为议题网络的一部分，议题网络是指许多不同的利益集团，甚至是利益集团之外的实体联合起来以实现一个短期的政策目标。例如，几年前，许多不同的团体联合起来形成一个非正式的议题网络，大力推动反对政府对烟农的补贴。自20世纪30年代以来就有政策给予烟农联邦资金支持，在过去十年里，要求取消这种补贴的运动越来越壮大。好的，这就是议题网络。 +

现在让我们换个话题，谈谈那些可能阻碍或帮助利益集团实现其目标的因素。首先，利益集团的活动会受到政治和经济资源不平等的影响。因为利益集团能为政策制定者做的最重要的事情之一就是帮助资助他们的竞选活动，所以政策制定者更有动力与资金雄厚的利益集团会面。例如，像全国步枪协会和美国退休人员协会这样的大型团体有大量资金，所以每个人都想听听他们的意见。 +

同样的现实也会影响到影响利益集团效力的第二个因素，即接触决策者的机会不平等。同样，资金少、成员少的利益集团更难让政策制定者倾听他们的意见。 +

影响利益集团工作成效的第三个因素是搭便车问题。这是指一个更大的群体从利益集团的努力中受益，而不仅仅是该集团的成员 —— 比如成员们支付费用，但他们提议的立法可能会帮助到比集团成员更多的人。再想想美国退休人员协会，它代表退休人员进行游说。显然，不是每个美国退休人员都是该组织的成员，但如果美国退休人员协会游说成功并通过了有利的立法，那么谁会从中受益呢？是所有退休人员。所以从这项立法中受益的人比实际推动立法通过的人要多得多。这就是搭便车问题。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取复习资料包，这将帮助你在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那就一定要订阅，我会照办的。海姆勒，退出。 +
