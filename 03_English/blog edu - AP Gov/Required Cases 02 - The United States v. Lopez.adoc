Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at a Supreme Court case 最高法院案例 required for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 United States v. Lopez (1995) 美国诉洛佩兹案（1995年）. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked interstate commerce 州际贸易 style, well then let's get to it. +

As with every required Supreme Court case for this curriculum, you need to know five things about this case. First up: the facts of the case. So in United States v. Lopez, here is what happens. In San Antonio, Texas, a high school senior named Alfonzo Lopez decided to carry a .38 caliber pistol 点38口径手枪 along with some bullets 子弹 to school. The administration 学校管理部门 received an anonymous tip 匿名举报 that he had done so, found the gun, and then Lopez was arrested and sent to jail because under Texas law it was forbidden 禁止 to carry a gun onto school property 校园. The next day, all the charges 指控 were dropped 撤销 against Lopez. Wait, why? Just hold on, I'ma tell you. +

As it turned out 结果是, in addition to 除…之外 the state laws in Texas prohibiting guns on school property, there was also a federal law 联邦法律 called the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 1990年无枪校园区法案 which also prohibited guns on school property. So the state charges were dropped because federal charges were brought against Lopez. And as it turned out, Lopez was found guilty of 被判有罪 breaking this federal law and sentenced to 被判处 six months in prison. Okay, that seems very clean, but here's where it gets a little messy 复杂起来. +

Let's look at the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中；攸关紧要, and here's where I have to clear up 澄清 a potential misconception 误解. Because the facts of this case have everything to do with guns, you're naturally going to think this is a Second Amendment 第二修正案 case. But it is not. Let me say it plainly 坦率地说: U.S. v. Lopez is not a case about the bang-bang or the pew-pew. Think back to the enumerated powers 列举权力 of Congress in the reserved powers 保留权力 of the states. Where in the Constitution does it say that the federal Congress has any authority 权力 to pass legislation 制定法律 about guns? That is right -- it does not. Gun legislation is a state issue. So how in the world did Congress pass a federal law prohibiting guns on school property? +

Well, they did it based on the authority granted to Congress in the Commerce Clause 商业条款 of Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution. There it says that Congress has the authority to regulate commerce 管理贸易 with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes 印第安部落. Now for our purposes, we just need to focus on Congress's authority to regulate commerce among the several states 州际贸易. And look, scholars have been arguing for a long time over exactly what this clause means, but basically it just means that Congress has the authority to establish a free trade zone 自由贸易区 among the states. So Congress passed the Gun-Free School Zones Act based on its authority in the Commerce Clause. +

Now that sounds confusing -- like what in the world does regulating interstate commerce have to do with bringing guns to school? Well, let me just show you how each side argued its case. The lawyers for the United States argued that guns in school are related to interstate commerce because guns lead to gun violence 枪支暴力, and if there is gun violence in schools, then people from other states might be less likely to travel through those towns, which would negatively affect commerce in those places. Additionally 此外, if gun violence is rampant 猖獗的 on school property, the learning environment deteriorates 恶化, which leads to a less educated citizenry 公民群体, which then leads to those citizens not buying as much stuff. If that sauce tastes a little weak to you, well, I'm not going to argue. +

Lopez's lawyers, on the other hand 另一方面, argued that gun regulation 枪支管制 on school property is a power specifically reserved for the states, and that the connection between the Commerce Clause and gun violence is weak at best 充其量 and tyrannical federal overreach 专制的联邦权力过度扩张 at worst. In other words, Congress had no business 无权 passing this law in the first place. So those were the arguments. Let's see how it was decided. +

As it turns out 结果是, the Supreme Court sided with 支持 Lopez in a 5-4 decision, and here's the reasoning from the majority opinion 多数意见: "Under the theories that the government presents in support of this case, it is difficult to perceive 察觉 any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement 刑事执法 or education where states historically have been sovereign 主权的. Thus, if we were to accept the government's arguments, we are hard-pressed to 很难 posit 假定 any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate." In other words, if Congress can use the Commerce Clause to regulate guns on school property, what can't Congress regulate with the Commerce Clause? +

So at the end of the day 归根结底, here's why this case matters. Ultimately 最终, this is a case about federalism 联邦制 and the balance of power 权力平衡 between the federal and state governments. There have been cases in the past like McCulloch v. Maryland that have tipped this balance of power toward the federal government. But in United States v. Lopez, the decision is a clear example of the court ruling in favor of 支持 state power over federal power. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中一个必修的最高法院案例，即 “美国诉洛佩兹案（United States v. Lopez，1995 年）”。所以，如果你准备好以 “州际贸易” 的方式激发自己的思维，那么我们就开始吧。 +

和这门课程中每个必修的最高法院案例一样，关于这个案例你需要了解五件事。首先：案件事实。在 “美国诉洛佩兹案” 中，事情是这样的。在得克萨斯州（Texas）圣安东尼奥市（San Antonio），一名叫阿方索·洛佩兹（Alfonzo Lopez）的高三学生决定携带一把点 38 口径的手枪和一些子弹去学校。学校管理层收到匿名举报说他这么做了，发现了那把枪，然后洛佩兹被捕并被送进了监狱，因为根据得克萨斯州的法律，携带枪支进入学校财产范围内是被禁止的。第二天，对洛佩兹的所有指控都被撤销了。等等，为什么呢？别急，我会告诉你的。 +

事实证明，除了得克萨斯州禁止在学校范围内携带枪支的州法律之外，还有一项联邦法律，即 1990 年的《无枪校区法案》（Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990），该法律也禁止在学校范围内携带枪支。所以州里的指控被撤销了，因为对洛佩兹提出了联邦指控。结果是，洛佩兹被判违反这项联邦法律，被判处六个月监禁。好的，看起来很清楚了，但事情还有些复杂的地方。 +

让我们看看所涉及的宪法原则，在这里我要澄清一个潜在的误解。因为这个案件的事实都与枪支有关，你自然会认为这是一个与宪法第二修正案（Second Amendment）相关的案件。但它不是。我直白地说：“美国诉洛佩兹案” 不是一个关于枪支（bang-bang 或 pew-pew ，这里表示与枪支相关的意思）的案件。回想一下国会的列举权力以及各州的保留权力。在宪法中哪里提到联邦国会有权通过关于枪支的立法呢？没错 —— 宪法里没有。枪支立法是一个州的事务。那么国会到底是如何通过一项禁止在学校范围内携带枪支的联邦法律的呢？ +

嗯，他们这么做是基于宪法第一条第八款中授予国会的权力，也就是商业条款（Commerce Clause）。条款里说国会有权管理与外国的贸易，以及各州之间和与印第安部落的贸易。就我们讨论的这个案件而言，我们只需要关注国会管理各州之间贸易的权力。看，学者们长期以来一直在争论这个条款的确切含义，但基本上它意味着国会有权在各州之间建立一个自由贸易区。所以国会基于商业条款的权力通过了《无枪校区法案》。 +

这听起来很令人困惑 —— 管理州际贸易和携带枪支去学校到底有什么关系呢？嗯，我来告诉你双方是如何进行辩论的。美国方面的律师辩称，学校里的枪支与州际贸易有关，因为枪支会导致枪支暴力，而如果学校里发生枪支暴力，其他州的人可能就不太愿意经过那些城镇，这会对那些地方的商业产生负面影响。此外，如果学校范围内枪支暴力猖獗，学习环境就会恶化，这会导致公民受教育程度降低，进而导致这些公民购买的东西减少。如果你觉得这个理由有点站不住脚，嗯，我也不打算争论。 +

另一方面，洛佩兹的律师辩称，对学校范围内枪支的管理是各州专门保留的权力，而且商业条款与枪支暴力之间的联系往好了说是很弱的，往坏了说是联邦权力的过度干预。换句话说，国会一开始就不该通过这项法律。所以这些就是双方的论点。让我们看看判决结果。 +

结果是，最高法院以 5 比 4 的裁决支持了洛佩兹，这是多数意见的推理：“根据政府在支持这个案件时提出的理论，很难察觉到对联邦权力的任何限制，即使是在刑法执行或教育等各州在历史上拥有主权的领域。因此，如果我们接受政府的论点，我们很难设想有任何个人的活动是国会无权管理的。” 换句话说，如果国会可以利用商业条款来管理学校范围内的枪支，那么有什么是国会不能用商业条款来管理的呢？ +

所以归根结底，这个案件重要的原因是这样的。从根本上说，这是一个关于联邦制以及联邦政府和州政府之间权力平衡的案件。过去有像 “麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案（McCulloch v. Maryland）” 这样的案件，这些案件使权力平衡倾向于联邦政府。但在 “美国诉洛佩兹案” 中，判决结果是法院做出了有利于州权力而非联邦权力的裁决。 +
