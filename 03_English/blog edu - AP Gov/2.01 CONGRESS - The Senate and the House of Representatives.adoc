hey there and welcome back to heimlich's history, and furthermore 此外；而且 welcome to the first video covering 涵盖；覆盖 unit 2 of the ap government curriculum 课程. this video is all about the congress 国会 of the united states, its structure 结构 and its power 权力. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milked bicameral 两院制的 style, well then let's get to it. +

as always, let me begin by telling you what we're aiming to accomplish 完成；实现 in this video: describe 描述 the different structures, powers and functions 功能 of each house in congress. easy peasy lemon squeezy 极其容易. now before we jump in, let me remind you that if you need help getting an a in your class and a five on your exam in may, then you can check out 查看；检查 my ap government ultimate 最终的；终极的 review packet 资料包. it's got exclusive 独有的；专用的 video content 内容 from this guy, practice questions, essential 基本的；必要的 questions and answers, and ap style practice exams 考试 to get you ready for the exam. so if that's something you're into, then you know, get your clicky finger out and check the link in the description 描述. +

okay, let's talk about congress, and first we'll deal with 处理 its structure. the united states congress is a bicameral legislature 立法机关, which means that it contains two houses. now remember that the federal 联邦的 congress under the articles of confederation 邦联条例 only had one house in congress, and each state was represented 代表 equally 平等地. but as my grandpappy used to say, that turned out to be about as effective 有效的 as a steering wheel 方向盘 on a mule 骡子. so under article 1 of the constitution 宪法, congressional power was divided into two houses. +

first is the senate 参议院, in which each state is represented equally. so no matter how many people live in an area, in the senate each state has two representatives 代表 and therefore 因此 two votes 选票. that means with 50 states we currently 目前 have 100 senators 参议员. now traditionally 传统上 the senate is considered the more mature 成熟的 body in congress on account of 因为 its members are required to be older than those in the house. you can't become a senator unless you've attained to 达到 the wise and old age of 30 years old. additionally 此外, senators hold six-year terms 任期, which is longer than house members, and the reason is that the framers 制定者 of the constitution wanted this house to be more insulated from 与…隔绝；不受…影响 public pressure 压力, which i'm going to tell you about in a moment when we talk about house members. senators have more constitutional 宪法的；符合宪法的 responsibility 责任 than do house members, and we'll talk more about that in the next video. and the last general id you need to know about the senate is this: because each state only has two senators, they represent the entire 整个的 state, and that means that senators are less connected to the intimate 详细的；密切的 details of most of the people that they represent. instead 相反, senators deal more with big issues 问题 and generality 普遍性. +

and then there's the house of representatives 众议院, in which each state is represented by population 人口. so more populous 人口众多的 states have more representatives and less populous states have less, and constitutionally 按照宪法地 every state, no matter how small it is, is guaranteed 保证 at least one representative. currently, federal law has kept the number of representatives in the house at 435. so how do we figure out 弄清楚 how many representatives each state gets? excellent question. we figure that out by means of 通过；借助于 the census 人口普查, which happens every 10 years, and it measures 测量 how many people live in the u.s and where they live, and then based on that data, seats 席位 in the house are reapportioned 重新分配 to reflect 反映 the current population. +

now the house is a little more scrappy 争强好斗的；活跃的 than the senate for a couple of reasons. first, a representative only has to be 25 years old to run for 竞选 a seat, which is approximately 大约 the year that a human brain is done developing, so that is something for which we can all be thankful. additionally, house members only hold two-year terms, so potentially 可能地 there's a lot more turnover 人员更替. now the two-year terms serve a very important purpose because representatives face re-election 再次选举 not too long after their butt cheeks hit their congressional seat. that means that they have to be much more responsive to 对…作出积极反应 the people who elected 选举 them. furthermore 此外, because there's usually so many more house members per state than senators -- though not in every case -- they are closer to the issues that people in their districts 选区 care about, since they don't represent a whole state, just a portion 部分 of the state. +

and one more thing: because of these shorter term lengths, house members are less likely to form bipartisan 两党的 coalitions 联盟 in order to pursue 追求；致力于 various 各种各样的 legislative 立法的 goals. and a coalition is just an alliance 联盟 of legislators 立法者 that work together for a common goal. +

okay, so now you understand the basic structure in each house. now let's talk in general about the purpose 目的 of congress. since congress embodies 体现；代表 the legislative branch 分支 of the government, that means their unique 独特的 purpose in our government is to make laws. no other branch of the federal government can do that. we're going to talk more about how that gets done in the next two videos, but for now just understand: in order for a bill 法案 to become a law, both houses of congress have to agree by vote 投票 on identical 完全相同的 versions 版本 of the bill, and if they do, then it gets passed to the president for signing 签署, and that's how a bill becomes a law. +

now in order for bills to get passed, there's an awful lot of debate 辩论 that happens on the floors of both houses, but because each house is structured differently, they have different rules for debate. because the senate is smaller, their rules provide for 规定 unlimited 无限制的 debate on bills, but on the other hand, the house has so many members they have rules that restrict 限制 debate to an hour per member. there are actually lots of caveats 警告；限制条件 to what i just said for the house, but for our purposes you just need to know that the senate debates are a lot more relaxed 宽松的 and informal 非正式的, whereas 然而 house debates are a lot more structured 有条理的 and governed by 受…支配 rules, and it's the size and structure of each house that dictates 决定 those formalities 正式手续 and informality 非正式性. +

okay, so we've talked about the structure and the function of congress. now let's see where they get their power and what kinds of power they have, and for that you need to know article 1 section 8 of the constitution. in this section we have what's called the enumerated 列举的 powers of congress, and if you enumerate 列举 something, that just means you list it out, and so here in article 1 section 8, the constitution makes a list of exactly what powers belong to congress, which enables 使能够 them to do the work of passing legislation 立法. and there are five of these enumerated powers that the ap overlords 主宰者；权威 want you to know. +

first, congress has the power to pass a federal budget 预算. sometimes you'll hear this referred to as 被称为 the power of the purse 财权. passing the federal budget, as you can imagine, is an incredibly 极其地 complex 复杂的 process 过程 which can often take months of negotiation 谈判 to settle 解决. second, congress has the power to raise revenue 收入, which is accomplished 完成 through taxation 征税 in various forms. the biggest portion 部分 of their revenue comes from income taxes 所得税, and then you have other taxes like tariffs 关税 etc. third, congress has the power to coin money 铸造货币, and this is a very good thing because it creates a uniform 统一的 currency 货币 throughout the nation and saves us from the headache of having different currencies in each state. fourth, congress has the power to declare war 宣战, and it was very important to the framers of the constitution that the branch of government that represented the people be the one responsible for sending those people to war. fifth, congress has the power to raise and maintain 维持 the armed forces 武装部队. again, very important that this job belongs to the people's representatives instead of the president, who could very easily slide into tyranny 暴政 with that power. +

so those are some of the enumerated powers that you need to know, but we also need to talk about the implied 隐含的；暗示的 powers of congress. now when something is implied, it means that you understand the meaning even if it's not explicitly 明确地 said. so implied powers are those powers which belong to congress but aren't actually written in article 1 section 8. and so where in the world does congress get these powers? well they get this power from the necessary and proper clause 条款 at the end of article 1 section 8, and it basically 基本上 says, right after it enumerates all the powers of congress, that this body also has the power to pass any law which may be deemed 认为 necessary and proper to carrying out 执行 the enumerated powers. and congress has used that power over the years to pass a wide range of legislation on economic and environmental and social issues. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课，此外，欢迎来到讲解美国大学预修课程政府学第二单元的第一个视频。这个视频全是关于美国国会的，包括它的结构和权力。所以，如果你准备好以两院制的方式汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

和往常一样，让我先告诉你我们在这个视频中的目标：描述国会中每个议院的不同结构、权力和职能。小菜一碟。在我们开始之前，让我提醒你，如果你需要帮助以在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分，那么你可以查看我的美国大学预修课程政府学终极复习资料包。它包含这个家伙（指自己）的独家视频内容、练习题、重要问题及答案，还有美国大学预修课程风格的模拟考试，让你为考试做好准备。所以，如果你对此感兴趣，那么，伸出你的手指点击一下，查看描述中的链接。 +

好的，让我们谈谈国会，首先我们来讨论它的结构。美国国会是一个两院制的立法机构，这意味着它有两个议院。记住，在《邦联条例》下的联邦国会只有一个议院，并且每个州的代表权是平等的。但就像我爷爷过去常说的，那（指《邦联条例》下的国会）就像骡子上的方向盘一样，没什么效果。所以根据宪法第一条，国会的权力被划分到两个议院。 +

首先是参议院（senate），在参议院中每个州的代表权是平等的。所以，无论一个地区有多少人口，在参议院中每个州有两名代表，因此有两票。这意味着，因为有50个州，我们目前有100名参议员。传统上，参议院被认为是国会中更成熟的机构，因为其成员要求比众议院的成员年龄大。除非你达到30岁这个明智而成熟的年龄，否则你不能成为一名参议员。此外，参议员的任期是六年，比众议员的任期长，原因是宪法的制定者希望这个议院能更多地免受公众压力，当我们谈论众议员时，我会告诉你这一点。参议员比众议员承担更多的宪法责任，我们将在下一个视频中更多地讨论这一点。关于参议院你需要知道的最后一个基本情况是：因为每个州只有两名参议员，他们代表整个州，这意味着参议员与他们所代表的大多数人的具体情况联系较少。相反，参议员更多地处理重大问题和一般性事务。 +

然后是众议院（house of representatives），在众议院中每个州的代表权是按人口分配的。所以人口较多的州有更多的代表，人口较少的州代表就较少，并且根据宪法，无论一个州多么小，都保证至少有一名代表。目前，联邦法律将众议院的代表人数保持在435人。那么我们如何确定每个州有多少代表呢？问得好。我们通过人口普查来确定，人口普查每10年进行一次，它统计美国有多少人口以及他们居住在哪里，然后根据这些数据，众议院的席位会重新分配以反映当前的人口情况。 +

众议院比参议院更活跃一些，原因有几个。首先，一名众议员只需年满25岁就可以竞选席位，这大约是人脑发育完成的年龄，所以这是一件值得庆幸的事情。此外，众议员的任期只有两年，所以人员更替的可能性要大得多。两年的任期有一个非常重要的目的，因为众议员在刚刚就任国会议员后不久就面临再次选举。这意味着他们必须对选举他们的人民更加负责。此外，因为每个州的众议员通常比参议员多（虽然不是在所有情况下），他们更接近他们选区的人民所关心的问题，因为他们不是代表整个州，而只是代表州的一部分。 +

还有一件事：由于任期较短，众议员不太可能为了追求各种立法目标而组成两党联盟。联盟是指为了共同目标而合作的立法者联盟。 +

好的，现在你了解了每个议院的基本结构。现在让我们总体谈谈国会的目的。因为国会体现了政府的立法分支，这意味着在我们的政府中，它独特的目的是制定法律。联邦政府的其他分支不能这样做。在接下来的两个视频中，我们将更多地讨论这是如何实现的，但现在只需明白：为了使一项法案成为法律，国会两院必须对法案的相同版本进行投票并达成一致，然后将其提交给总统签署，这就是一项法案成为法律的过程。 +

为了使法案获得通过，两院的议场都会进行大量的辩论，但因为每个议院的结构不同，它们有不同的辩论规则。因为参议院的规模较小，它的规则允许对法案进行无限制的辩论，但另一方面，众议院的成员众多，它的规则限制每个成员的辩论时间为一个小时。实际上，对于我刚才说的众议院的情况有很多附加条件，但就我们的目的而言，你只需要知道参议院的辩论更加宽松和随意，而众议院的辩论更加结构化且受规则约束，是每个议院的规模和结构决定了这些正式和非正式的情况。 +

好的，我们已经讨论了国会的结构和职能。现在让我们看看国会的权力从何而来以及它们拥有哪些权力，为此你需要了解宪法第一条第八款。在这一款中，我们有所谓的国会列举权力，如果你列举某事物，意思就是把它列出来，所以在宪法第一条第八款中，宪法确切地列出了哪些权力属于国会，这使它们能够开展通过立法的工作。美国大学预修课程的主导者希望你了解五项这样的列举权力。 +

首先，国会有权通过联邦预算。有时你会听到这被称为“钱袋权力”。通过联邦预算，如你所想，是一个极其复杂的过程，通常需要数月的谈判才能确定。其次，国会有权筹集收入，这是通过各种形式的税收来实现的。他们的收入最大一部分来自所得税，然后还有其他税收，比如关税等。第三，国会有权铸造货币，这是一件非常好的事情，因为它在全国建立了统一的货币，使我们不必为每个州有不同的货币而头疼。第四，国会有权宣战，对于宪法的制定者来说，代表人民的政府分支负责派遣人们去参战这一点非常重要。第五，国会有权招募和维持武装部队。同样，这项工作属于人民的代表而不是总统，这一点非常重要，因为总统如果拥有这项权力，很容易走向暴政。 +

这些是你需要知道的一些列举权力，但我们也需要谈谈国会的隐含权力。当某事物是隐含的，意思是即使它没有被明确表述，你也能理解其含义。所以隐含权力是那些属于国会但实际上没有写在宪法第一条第八款中的权力。那么国会从哪里获得这些权力呢？嗯，它们从宪法第一条第八款末尾的“必要和适当条款”中获得这些权力，基本上在列举了国会的所有权力之后，它说这个机构也有权通过任何被认为对于执行列举权力来说是必要和适当的法律。多年来，国会利用这项权力通过了一系列关于经济、环境和社会问题的广泛立法。 +

好的，感谢观看。如果你需要帮助以在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在缅因州（Maine）的考试中获得5分，这里是我的复习资料包的链接。如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那么通过订阅让我知道。最后，如果你在第二单元需要更多帮助，那么这个播放列表会让你所有的梦想成真。海姆勒退场。 +
