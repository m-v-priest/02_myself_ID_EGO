Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now I've been going through Unit 4 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video we're going to talk about how political ideology 政治意识形态 shapes economic policy 经济政策. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked supply-side 供给学派 style, well then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: describe different political ideologies 政治意识形态 on the role of government in regulating the marketplace 调控市场. Easy peasy lemon squeezy 易如反掌. So if you're here for the last couple of videos, I've been describing different political ideologies and their respective commitments 各自的理念, and we focused on liberal 自由派的 and conservative ideology 保守派的意识形态. And just to keep things spicy 有趣, we're going to go ahead and add a third ideology to the mix 在其中加入 in this video, namely libertarian ideology 自由意志主义意识形态. So how do each of these ideologies think about government intervention 政府干预 in the economy? So glad you asked, let's talk about it. +

Now if we're going to talk economics 经济学, there are two terms that you're going to need to be familiar with. And the first is fiscal policy 财政政策. Fiscal policy refers to 指的是 decisions the government makes about government spending 政府支出 and taxation 税收. So fiscal policy is the decision that the government has to make about how much money to spend and on what -- like do we really need another F-15 fighter jet? Oh yeah. Okay, so when the government decides on that kind of thing, that is fiscal policy. And this is under the control of 由…控制 Congress 国会 who decides what to spend where. +

The second term you need to know is monetary policy 货币政策. Now monetary policy refers to the decisions the government makes about how much money should be in the economy 经济中的货币供应量. The reason I have this little green bill 钞票 in my wallet is because the government has decided that there needs to be money in the economy. So when the government decides to put more of those bills into the economy or take some out, they are engaging in 从事；参与 monetary policy. And this is under the control of the Federal Reserve 联邦储备系统, often referred to as the Fed 美联储. And the Fed does this by buying and selling government bonds 政府债券, setting reserve requirements 准备金要求 at banks (which means they mandate 规定 how much money the banks have to keep in their vaults 金库), and setting interest rates 利率. +

Okay, to sum up 总结: fiscal policy -- government spending and taxation; monetary policy -- how much money is in the economy. So with that said, let's talk about how different ideologies approach 处理 these different policies. +

Liberals tend to favor 倾向于支持 the most government intervention in the economy compared to the other ideologies. To liberals, government spending and government regulation of business 商业监管 is what keeps the economy strong and keeps everyone safe and secure 安全稳定. So when it comes to fiscal policies 财政政策, liberals are big spenders 大手大脚的支出者. And they didn't just pluck that idea out of the realm of unicorns and rainbows 凭空捏造；不切实际 -- they actually have theoretical support 理论支持 for this idea, and the name for it is Keynesian economics 凯恩斯主义经济学. And this theory really majors on 主要关注 fiscal policy. +

This theory came into fashion 流行起来 in the 1930s in the midst of 在…之中 the Great Depression 大萧条 in the election of Democrat Franklin Roosevelt. Now I mentioned in the previous video that the president preceding Roosevelt 罗斯福之前的总统, namely Herbert Hoover, was a conservative, and so when the stock market crashed 股市崩盘 and the Great Depression began and all turned to doom and gloom 一片黑暗, Hoover's conservative position led him to do very little. To Hoover, like, the market is going to correct itself 自我修正 in the long run 从长远来看 and all shall be well -- no need to get big daddy government meddling in 干预 the economy. That's when John Maynard Keynes came along and rebuked 指责 Hoover and all who thought in similar ways, saying "in the long run we're all dead." In other words, yes the economy will correct itself in the long run, but there is immense suffering 巨大痛苦 now and something must be done while people are suffering besides just waiting for the resolution of the crisis 危机的解决. +

So Roosevelt, being a good Keynesian, pumped up 增加 government spending like a boss by providing federal work programs 联邦就业计划 and economic safety nets 经济安全网 in the form of Social Security 社会保障. +

Now conservatives, on the other hand, want less government intervention in the economy. To conservatives, letting the free market 自由市场 determine people's choices is a far better solution than getting the government involved. To them, this position upholds 维护 people's freedom to make their own economic choices 经济选择自由 and keeps the government from piling up debt 累积债务 to pay for all the programs. So when it comes to fiscal policy, conservatives want less government programs 政府项目 and lower taxes 降低税收. And again, conservatives didn't just pluck these ideas out of the realm of unicorns -- they do have theoretical support for it, and it comes in the form of supply-side economics 供给学派经济学. +

If Keynesians want to address economic woes 经济困境 through government spending, supply-siders want to address economic woes by supporting businesses. The idea here is that if more goods are injected into 注入 the economy, then such an action will shore up 支撑 economic turmoil 经济动荡. And who produces goods for the economy? Businesses. Now as you probably know, the most basic terms of free market economics 自由市场经济 are supply and demand 供求关系. Businesses supply goods according to the demand from the consumers. And so that's why it's called supply-side economics -- support the supply side of that equation 等式 (which is to say businesses, the producers of goods) and the economy will be good. So the way conservatives propose to do that is by keeping government regulations of business to a minimum 最小化 and lowering taxes so that people have more money to spend on those goods. +

Now I haven't said anything about how conservatives and liberals view monetary policy 货币政策, and that's because it's pretty complicated. However, what you do need to know for your exam is this: conservatives tend to favor using monetary policy to stabilize the economy 稳定经济, whereas liberals tend to believe that monetary policy is too slow to affect real change 产生实际效果. +

Okay, now let's talk about libertarian ideology 自由意志主义意识形态. And the truth is libertarians are strange birds 与众不同的人 that are difficult to classify on the whole 很难归类. But since we're talking about economics in this video, you should know that libertarians want the least amount of government intervention possible 尽可能少的政府干预. To libertarians, the only thing the government is good for (economically speaking 从经济角度而言) is to protect personal property rights 个人财产权 and ensure that nothing hinders 阻碍 voluntary trade 自愿交易. They want no regulation on businesses and minimal government programs 最少的政府项目. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。目前我一直在研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第四单元，在这个视频中，我们将讨论政治意识形态如何塑造经济政策。所以，如果你准备好以供给侧的方式来激发你的思维，那么我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：描述不同的政治意识形态对于政府在监管市场方面的作用的看法。小菜一碟。所以如果你看了前面的几个视频，我一直在描述不同的政治意识形态以及它们各自的主张，并且我们关注了自由主义（liberal）和保守主义（conservative）意识形态。为了让内容更有趣，在这个视频中，我们将添加第三种意识形态，也就是自由意志主义（libertarian）意识形态。那么这些意识形态各自是如何看待政府对经济的干预的呢？很高兴你问了这个问题，我们来谈谈吧。 +

现在，如果我们要谈论经济学，有两个术语你需要熟悉。第一个是财政政策（fiscal policy）。财政政策是指政府在政府支出和税收方面所做的决策。所以财政政策是政府必须做出的关于要花多少钱以及花在什么方面的决策 —— 比如我们真的需要另一架F-15战斗机吗？哦，是的。好的，所以当政府决定这类事情时，这就是财政政策。而这是由国会（Congress）控制的，国会决定在哪里花钱。 +

你需要知道的第二个术语是货币政策（monetary policy）。现在，货币政策是指政府对经济中应该有多少货币所做的决策。我钱包里有这张绿色的钞票的原因是因为政府决定经济中需要有货币。所以当政府决定向经济中投入更多这样的钞票或者取出一些时，他们就是在实施货币政策。而这是由美国联邦储备系统（Federal Reserve，通常称为美联储（the Fed））控制的。美联储通过买卖政府债券、设定银行的准备金要求（这意味着他们规定银行必须在金库中保留多少钱）以及设定利率来做到这一点。 +

好的，总结一下：财政政策 —— 政府支出和税收；货币政策 —— 经济中的货币数量。所以说了这些之后，让我们谈谈不同的意识形态是如何对待这些不同政策的。 +

与其他意识形态相比，自由主义者倾向于最支持政府对经济的干预。对自由主义者来说，政府支出和对企业的监管是保持经济强劲以及保障每个人安全和稳定的因素。所以在财政政策方面，自由主义者是大手大脚的支出者。而且他们并不是凭空想出这个主意的 —— 他们实际上有理论支持，这个理论叫做凯恩斯经济学（Keynesian economics）。并且这个理论主要关注财政政策。 +

这个理论在20世纪30年代大萧条（the Great Depression）期间民主党人富兰克林·罗斯福（Franklin Roosevelt）当选总统时开始流行。我在上一个视频中提到，在罗斯福之前的总统，也就是赫伯特·胡佛（Herbert Hoover），是一个保守主义者，所以当股市崩盘、大萧条开始，一切都变得灰暗时，胡佛的保守主义立场使他几乎没做什么。对胡佛来说，市场从长远来看会自我修正，一切都会好起来 —— 不需要大政府来干预经济。就在那时，约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）站出来反驳了胡佛以及所有有类似想法的人，他说 “从长远来看，我们都死了。” 换句话说，是的，经济从长远来看会自我修正，但现在人们正遭受巨大的痛苦，除了等待危机的解决，还必须采取一些措施。 +

所以，作为一个优秀的凯恩斯主义者，罗斯福像个大佬一样增加了政府支出，提供了联邦工作项目，并以社会保障（Social Security）的形式建立了经济安全网。 +

另一方面，保守主义者希望政府对经济的干预更少。对保守主义者来说，让自由市场决定人们的选择比让政府参与要好得多。对他们来说，这种立场维护了人们做出自己经济选择的自由，并防止政府为了支付所有项目而累积债务。所以在财政政策方面，保守主义者希望政府项目更少，税收更低。同样，保守主义者并不是凭空想出这些主意的 —— 他们确实有理论支持，这种理论以供给侧经济学（supply-side economics）的形式存在。 +

如果凯恩斯主义者想通过政府支出来解决经济困境，供给侧学派则想通过支持企业来解决经济困境。这里的想法是，如果向经济中注入更多商品，那么这样的行动将缓解经济动荡。那么谁为经济生产商品呢？企业。现在你可能知道，自由市场经济最基本的术语是供给和需求。企业根据消费者的需求供应商品。这就是为什么它被称为供给侧经济学 —— 支持这个等式的供给侧（也就是说企业，商品的生产者），经济就会好起来。所以保守主义者提出的做法是尽量减少政府对企业的监管，并降低税收，这样人们就有更多的钱来购买这些商品。 +

现在我还没有说过保守主义者和自由主义者对货币政策的看法，这是因为这相当复杂。然而，你在考试中需要知道的是：保守主义者倾向于使用货币政策来稳定经济，而自由主义者倾向于认为货币政策在产生实际变化方面太慢了。 +

好的，现在让我们谈谈自由意志主义意识形态。事实上，自由意志主义者是很难整体归类的一群人。但既然我们在这个视频中谈论经济学，你应该知道自由意志主义者希望政府干预尽可能少。对自由意志主义者来说，政府在经济方面唯一有用的地方是保护个人财产权，并确保没有任何东西阻碍自愿贸易。他们希望对企业没有监管，政府项目也最少。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取复习资料包，它将帮助你在课堂上获得A，并在五月份的考试中获得5分。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那么一定要订阅，我会照做的。我走了。 +
