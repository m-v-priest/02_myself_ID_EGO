Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History, and furthermore 此外；而且 welcome to another video on your required 必修的 Supreme Court 最高法院 cases for the AP Government curriculum 课程大纲. In this video, we're going to be considering 考虑 everything you need to know about the landmark 具有重大意义的 case Engel v. Vitale. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked 挤脑汁（幽默说法） separation of church and state 政教分离 style, well then let's get to it. +

So as always, let's begin with the facts 事实 of the case. This case came before the court in 1962, and before that time, the New York Board of Regents 教育委员会 had composed 撰写；创作 a non-denominational 不属于任何宗派的 prayer 祷告；祈祷文 to be recited 背诵；朗诵 by school children after saying the Pledge of Allegiance 效忠誓言. And the prayer, just 22 words in length, went something like this: "Almighty God, we acknowledge 承认；感谢 our dependence 依赖；依靠 upon Thee（古语）你, and we beg 恳求 Thy（古语）你的 blessings 祝福；恩典 upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country." Now as far as prayers go, that one's pretty vague 模糊的；不具体的 — like ain't nobody invoking 祈求；援引 Jesus or Allah in that prayer. And what's more, children could opt out of 决定不参加 that prayer with written permission 许可；同意 from their parents. +

Even so, a group of parents led by Stephen Engel challenged 质疑；提出异议 the practice 做法；惯例. And why did they do that? Well for that, let's consider the constitutional 宪法的 principle 原则 at stake 涉及的核心问题. For Engel and his crew 成员；一伙人, this prayer was a violation 违反；违背 of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause 建立条款, which in case you forgot says that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion 宗教." +

Now if you're paying attention — and I know that you are — you might be saying, "Wait what? Congress isn't even involved 参与 here. This is a New York state law." So how could Engel claim 声称；认为 that this law was violating his First Amendment rights 权利 which protects citizens from the federal government 联邦政府?" Now if that's your question, then let me hasten to 赶紧；急忙 remind you of the 14th Amendment, which says, "No state shall make or enforce 强制执行 any law which shall abridge 削弱；限制 the privileges 特权；权利 or immunities 豁免权 of the citizens of the United States." So the 14th Amendment essentially 本质上；事实上 applies the First Amendment to the states as well as to the federal government. But don't get confused by all the amendments — at the end of the day 归根结底, this is a case about the Establishment Clause 建立条款 of the First Amendment. +

Okay, so what was the decision 判决；裁定? Well, the question the court considered was this: Does the reading of a state-sponsored 由州政府支持的 prayer at the beginning of school violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment? And their answer, in a 6-1 decision, was yes — the prayer did in fact violate the First Amendment. It was Justice Hugo Black who wrote the majority opinion 多数意见（法院的）, and in it he said, "The First Amendment was added to the Constitution to stand as a guarantee 保证；保障 that neither the power 权力 nor the prestige 威望；声誉 of the federal government would be used to control 控制, support 支持 or influence 影响 the kinds of prayer the American people can say." +

Now Justice Potter Stewart was the one justice who dissented 持异议；反对, and his reasoning 理由；理由 was that the practice of school prayer was constitutional 合宪的 because it gave children "the opportunity of sharing in the spiritual 精神的；宗教的 heritage 遗产；传统 of our nation." Additionally 此外；而且, Stewart argued that the government isn't establishing 建立；确立 a religion just by offering a prayer for those who want to pray. However, it was Thomas Jefferson's famous "wall of separation between church and state 政教分离的屏障" that won the day 占上风；最终胜出 in this case. +

Alright, now let's talk about why this case matters 重要；有意义. First of all, the Engel decision was a demonstration 显示；证明 of how the court ruled in favor of 支持 individual 个体的；个人的 liberties 自由权. Remember, in First Amendment cases, the court is always trying to strike a balance 在……之间寻找平衡 between social order 社会秩序 and individual liberty 个人自由, and in this case they went with the latter 后者. Second, this case matters because it established 建立；确立 the groundwork 基础；开端 for many subsequent 后来的；随后发生的 cases regarding schools and religious activities 宗教活动. For example, Engel was cited 援引；引用 in the Wallace v. Jaffree case in 1985, which struck down 废除；判定无效 an Alabama law that provided for a minute of silence 沉默时刻 at the beginning of the school day. And in 1992, it was also the basis for declaring clergy-led 由神职人员主导的 prayer at a middle school graduation ceremony 毕业典礼 unconstitutional 违反宪法的. And there are several other cases I could mention, but the point is Engel v. Vitale was a very important case that had implications 影响；后果 for the relationship between government and religion for decades 数十年 to come. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程，而且还欢迎来到关于美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中最高法院必学案例的另一个视频。在这个视频中，我们将探讨关于具有里程碑意义的 “恩格尔诉维塔尔案”（Engel v. Vitale）你需要知道的所有内容。所以，如果你准备好以政教分离的方式汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

和往常一样，我们先来看这个案件的事实。这个案件于1962年提交到法院，在那之前，纽约州教育委员会（New York Board of Regents）编写了一段非教派的祈祷词，让学童在背诵《效忠誓词》之后诵读。这段祈祷词只有22个单词，内容大致是这样的：“全能的上帝，我们承认我们依赖于你，我们祈求你保佑我们、我们的父母、我们的老师和我们的国家。” 就祈祷词而言，这段祈祷词相当含糊——比如在这段祈祷词中没有人援引耶稣或真主。而且，孩子们可以在得到父母书面许可的情况下不参与这段祈祷。 +

即便如此，由斯蒂芬·恩格尔（Stephen Engel）带领的一群家长对这种做法提出了质疑。他们为什么这么做呢？嗯，为了弄清楚这个问题，我们来考虑一下所涉及的宪法原则。对于恩格尔和他的团队来说，这段祈祷词违反了第一修正案（First Amendment）的设立条款（Establishment Clause），如果你忘了，设立条款规定 “国会不得制定关于确立宗教的法律”。 +

现在，如果你在认真听——我知道你在认真听——你可能会说，“等等，这跟国会没有关系啊。这是纽约州的法律。那么恩格尔怎么能声称这项法律侵犯了他受第一修正案保护、免受联邦政府干涉的权利呢？” 既然这是你想问的问题，那让我赶紧提醒你第十四修正案（14th Amendment），它规定 “任何州不得制定或执行任何剥夺美国公民的特权或豁免权的法律”。所以第十四修正案实际上将第一修正案应用到了各州，就如同应用到联邦政府一样。但不要被这些修正案弄糊涂了——归根结底，这是一个关于第一修正案设立条款的案件。 +

好的，那么裁决是什么呢？嗯，法院考虑的问题是：在学校开始时诵读州政府支持的祈祷词是否违反第一修正案的设立条款？他们以6比1的裁决结果认为，是的——这段祈祷词确实违反了第一修正案。雨果·布莱克（Hugo Black）大法官撰写了多数意见，他在意见中说：“第一修正案被添加到宪法中，是为了保证联邦政府的权力和威望不会被用来控制、支持或影响美国人民进行的祈祷的种类。” +

波特·斯图尔特（Potter Stewart）大法官是唯一持异议的大法官，他的理由是学校祈祷的做法是符合宪法的，因为这给了孩子们 “分享我们国家精神遗产的机会”。此外，斯图尔特认为，政府仅仅是为那些想要祈祷的人提供一段祈祷词，并没有确立一种宗教。然而，托马斯·杰斐逊（Thomas Jefferson）著名的 “政教分离之墙” 的观点在这个案件中占了上风。 +

好的，现在我们来谈谈这个案件为什么重要。首先，“恩格尔案” 的裁决展示了法院如何做出有利于个人自由的裁决。记住，在涉及第一修正案的案件中，法院总是试图在社会秩序和个人自由之间取得平衡，而在这个案件中，他们选择了个人自由。其次，这个案件很重要，因为它为许多后续关于学校和宗教活动的案件奠定了基础。例如，1985年的 “华莱士诉贾弗里案”（Wallace v. Jaffree）援引了 “恩格尔案”，该案废除了一项阿拉巴马州的法律，该法律规定在学校一天开始时进行一分钟的默祷。1992年，它也是宣布在中学毕业典礼上由神职人员带领祈祷违宪的依据。我还可以提到其他几个案件，但关键是 “恩格尔诉维塔尔案” 是一个非常重要的案件，它对政府与宗教之间的关系在未来几十年都产生了影响。 +

Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History, and furthermore welcome to another video on your required Supreme Court cases for the AP Government curriculum. In this video, we're going to be considering everything you need to know about the landmark case Engel v. Vitale. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked separation of church and state style, well then let's get to it.

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. This case came before the court in 1962, and before that time, the New York Board of Regents had composed a non-denominational prayer to be recited by school children after saying the Pledge of Allegiance. And the prayer, just 22 words in length, went something like this: "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country." Now as far as prayers go, that one's pretty vague -- like ain't nobody invoking Jesus or Allah in that prayer. And what's more, children could opt out of that prayer with written permission from their parents.

Even so, a group of parents led by Stephen Engel challenged the practice. And why did they do that? Well for that, let's consider the constitutional principle at stake. For Engel and his crew, this prayer was a violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which in case you forgot says that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."

Now if you're paying attention -- and I know that you are -- you might be saying, "Wait what? Congress isn't even involved here. This is a New York state law. So how could Engel claim that this law was violating his First Amendment rights which protects citizens from the federal government?" Now that's your question, then let me hasten to remind you of the 14th Amendment, which says, "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of the citizens of the United States." So the 14th Amendment essentially applies the First Amendment to the states as well as to the federal government. But don't get confused by all the amendments -- at the end of the day, this is a case about the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

Okay, so what was the decision? Well, the question the court considered was this: Does the reading of a state-sponsored prayer at the beginning of school violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment? And their answer, in a 6-1 decision, was yes -- the prayer did in fact violate the First Amendment. It was Justice Hugo Black who wrote the majority opinion, and in it he said, "The First Amendment was added to the Constitution to stand as a guarantee that neither the power nor the prestige of the federal government would be used to control, support or influence the kinds of prayer the American people can say."

Now Justice Potter Stewart was the one justice who dissented, and his reasoning was that the practice of school prayer was constitutional because it gave children "the opportunity of sharing in the spiritual heritage of our nation." Additionally, Stewart argued that the government isn't establishing a religion just by offering a prayer for those who want to pray. However, it was Thomas Jefferson's famous "wall of separation between church and state" that won the day in this case.

Alright, now let's talk about why this case matters. First of all, the Engel decision was a demonstration of how the court ruled in favor of individual liberties. Remember, in First Amendment cases, the court is always trying to strike a balance between social order and individual liberty, and in this case they went with the latter. Second, this case matters because it established the groundwork for many subsequent cases regarding schools and religious activities. For example, Engel was cited in the Wallace v. Jaffree case in 1985, which struck down an Alabama law that provided for a minute of silence at the beginning of the school day. And in 1992, it was also the basis for declaring clergy-led prayer at a middle school graduation ceremony unconstitutional. And there are several other cases I could mention, but the point is Engel v. Vitale was a very important case that had implications for the relationship between government and religion for decades to come.
