Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at yet another one of your required 必修的 Supreme Court 最高法院 cases for the AP Government curriculum 课程大纲, namely Brown v. the Board of Education. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked 挤脑汁（幽默说法）, then let's get to it. +

So as always, let's begin with the facts 事实 of the case. What we call Brown versus the Board of Education was actually a series 系列 of cases consolidated 合并；整合 into one, and all of them had to do with racial 种族的 segregation 种族隔离 in schools. So as the result of Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法（南方种族隔离法规） in the South, many states had separate 分开的 schools for white children and black children. And this was justified 辩护；证明有理 based on the Supreme Court's ruling 裁决；判决 in another landmark 具有重大意义的 case from 1896 called Plessy v. Ferguson, which established 确立；制定 the "separate but equal" doctrine 原则；信条. What that meant is that the court ruled that racial segregation in public 公共的 facilities 设施；场所 was indeed constitutional 合宪的 as long as the separate facilities were equal. +

So the case that we're considering 考虑；审议, Brown v. the Board of Education, came about 出现；发生 because a black family tried to get their daughter enrolled 注册；登记 in a white school that was close to their house, but they were denied 拒绝 admission 录取；进入权 and thus 因此；于是 were required 被要求 to bus their daughter to a much more distant 遥远的 black school. Lower courts heard this case and upheld 维持；支持 the precedent 判例；先例 set in Plessy, and on appeal 上诉 the case came before the Supreme Court. +

So what was the constitutional 宪法的 principle 原则 at stake 处于危险中；涉及重大利益? Well, Brown and the other advocates 倡导者；支持者 argued that racial segregation in schools was a violation 违反；侵害 of the Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款 of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案. The lawyer for Brown, Thurgood Marshall, argued using new findings 研究结果；发现 in social science 社会科学 about racism 种族主义, saying that even if separate facilities were equal in terms of 就……而言 funding 资金；拨款 etc., the very fact of separation was inherently 本质上；固有地 unequal. To separate black children from white children, Marshall argued, did damage 损害；破坏 to the psyche 心灵；心理 of black children and instilled 灌输；注入 in them an inferiority 自卑；低人一等 that was not easily shed 摆脱；去除. +

So in light of 鉴于；考虑到 that, what was the decision 判决；裁定? Well, as I've told you in other videos, it is a rare thing for the Supreme Court to overturn 推翻 existing 现有的 precedent, but in this case by unanimous 一致的 decision that is exactly what they did. The court agreed that separate facilities violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, thus 因此 overturning 推翻；撤销 the precedent set in Plessy v. Ferguson. In his written opinion 书面意见, Chief Justice 首席大法官 Earl Warren said this: "To separate black children from others of similar 相似的 age and qualifications 资历；资格 solely 仅仅；完全 because of their race generates 引起；造成 a feeling of inferiority as to their status 地位 in the community 社区 that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone 撤销；改变. We conclude that in the field of public education 公共教育领域, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational 教育的 facilities are inherently 本质上；固有地 unequal." +

Okay, now why does this case matter 重要；要紧? Well, it matters first of all 首先；第一 because it was a massive 巨大的；重大的 judicial 司法的 victory 胜利 for the burgeoning 迅速发展的 civil rights movement 民权运动. The movement, which really began picking up steam 蓄势；加速发展 in the 1950s, sought 寻求；争取 all kinds of legislative 立法的 and judicial 司法的 acts 措施；法案 which would acknowledge 承认；认可 the equality 平等 of black and white Americans, and the Brown case was a massive step in that direction 朝着那个方向的重要一步. +

However, as you can probably imagine 想象, many of the southern 南方的 states for whom school segregation 种族隔离 was the norm 常态 resisted 抵制；反对 integration 融合；整合 mightily 极力地；强烈地. Unfortunately, these states were given some license 自由；许可 to do so because of the vague 模糊的；含糊不清的 wording 措辞；用词 of the Supreme Court's decision. The court ordered 命令；指示 that schools be integrated 实现融合 with "all deliberate 故意的；慎重的 speed", and while we understand exactly what they meant by that — like, do it now — southerners 南方人 found just enough latitude 自由；余地 in that phrase 短语；说法 to stall 拖延；拖住. "All right, let's go let's get those schools integrated now. Well, when it comes to speed, we would like to obey the dictate 命令；指示 of the Supreme Court and be very deliberate 慎重的；从容的 about it. So y'all let us alone while we go put some real time into figuring out 弄清楚 how fast we can rightly go." +

Anyway, while the Brown decision was in fact 事实上 a great victory on paper 理论上；书面上, it was quite a while 一段时间 before schools were integrated. But that's a video for another time. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个最高法院的必学案例，也就是 “布朗诉教育委员会案”（Brown v. the Board of Education）。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

和往常一样，我们先来看这个案件的事实。我们所说的 “布朗诉教育委员会案” 实际上是一系列案件合并成的一个案件，所有这些案件都与学校里的种族隔离有关。由于南方的吉姆·克劳法（Jim Crow laws），许多州为白人孩子和黑人孩子设立了不同的学校。这一做法的依据是最高法院在1896年的另一个具有里程碑意义的案件 “普莱西诉弗格森案”（Plessy v. Ferguson）中的裁决，该裁决确立了 “隔离但平等” 的原则。这意味着法院裁定，只要隔离的设施是平等的，公共设施中的种族隔离就是符合宪法的。 +

我们正在讨论的 “布朗诉教育委员会案” 的起因是，一个黑人家庭试图让他们的女儿进入离家较近的一所白人学校，但他们的入学申请被拒绝了，因此他们不得不让女儿乘校车去一所距离远得多的黑人学校。下级法院审理了这个案件，并维持了 “普莱西案” 确立的先例，然后这个案件在上诉时提交到了最高法院。 +

那么这个案件所涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？嗯，布朗（Brown）和其他支持者认为，学校里的种族隔离违反了第十四修正案（14th Amendment）的平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）。布朗一方的律师瑟古德·马歇尔（Thurgood Marshall）利用社会科学中关于种族主义的新发现进行辩论，他说，即使隔离的设施在资金等方面是平等的，隔离这一事实本身就是不平等的。马歇尔认为，将黑人孩子与白人孩子隔离开来，会损害黑人孩子的心理健康，并在他们心中灌输一种难以消除的自卑感。 +

鉴于此，裁决是什么呢？嗯，就像我在其他视频中告诉过你的，最高法院推翻现有先例是很少见的，但在这个案件中，他们一致决定这么做。法院认为，隔离的设施违反了第十四修正案的平等保护条款，从而推翻了 “普莱西诉弗格森案” 确立的先例。首席大法官厄尔·沃伦（Earl Warren）在他的书面意见中说：“仅仅因为种族就将黑人孩子与其他年龄和资质相似的孩子隔离开来，会在他们心中产生一种在社区中低人一等的感觉，这种感觉对他们的影响可能永远无法消除。我们的结论是，在公共教育领域，‘隔离但平等’ 的原则没有立足之地。隔离的教育设施本质上就是不平等的。” +

好的，那么这个案件为什么重要呢？嗯，首先，对于蓬勃发展的民权运动来说，这是一场重大的司法胜利。民权运动在20世纪50年代真正开始兴起，它寻求各种立法和司法行动来承认美国黑人和白人的平等，而 “布朗案” 是朝着这个方向迈出的重要一步。 +

然而，正如你可能想象的那样，许多将学校种族隔离视为常态的南方各州强烈抵制学校的种族融合。不幸的是，由于最高法院裁决的措辞模糊，这些州有一定的操作空间。法院命令学校 “以深思熟虑的速度” 实现种族融合，虽然我们确切地知道他们这么说的意思——比如，现在就行动——但南方人在这个短语中找到了足够的回旋余地来拖延。“好吧，我们现在就去实现学校的种族融合。嗯，说到速度，我们愿意服从最高法院的命令，并且会深思熟虑地去做。所以在我们花时间弄清楚到底该以多快的速度行动的时候，请大家不要打扰我们。” +

不管怎样，虽然 “布朗案” 的裁决在纸面上确实是一场伟大的胜利，但学校实现种族融合还需要很长时间。但这是另一个视频要讲的内容了。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的 “布朗诉教育委员会案”（Brown v. the Board of Education）。如果你需要，我这里有关于所有其他必学案例的视频。如果你想在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分，那么点击这里获取复习资料包，你所有的梦想都会实现。最后，如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那么一定要订阅，我会照做的。我下线了。 +

Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at yet another one of your required Supreme Court cases for the AP Government curriculum, namely Brown v. the Board of Education. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it.

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. What we call Brown versus the Board of Education was actually a series of cases consolidated into one, and all of them had to do with racial segregation in schools. So as the result of Jim Crow laws in the South, many states had separate schools for white children and black children. And this was justified based on the Supreme Court's ruling in another landmark case from 1896 called Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the "separate but equal" doctrine. What that meant is that the court ruled that racial segregation in public facilities was indeed constitutional as long as the separate facilities were equal.

So the case that we're considering, Brown v. the Board of Education, came about because a black family tried to get their daughter enrolled in a white school that was close to their house, but they were denied admission and thus were required to bus their daughter to a much more distant black school. Lower courts heard this case and upheld the precedent set in Plessy, and on appeal the case came before the Supreme Court.

So what was the constitutional principle at stake? Well, Brown and the other advocates argued that racial segregation in schools was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The lawyer for Brown, Thurgood Marshall, argued using new findings in social science about racism, saying that even if separate facilities were equal in terms of funding etc., the very fact of separation was inherently unequal. To separate black children from white children, Marshall argued, did damage to the psyche of black children and instilled in them an inferiority that was not easily shed.

So in light of that, what was the decision? Well, as I've told you in other videos, it is a rare thing for the Supreme Court to overturn existing precedent, but in this case by unanimous decision that is exactly what they did. The court agreed that separate facilities violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, thus overturning the precedent set in Plessy v. Ferguson. In his written opinion, Chief Justice Earl Warren said this: "To separate black children from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. We conclude that in the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."

Okay, now why does this case matter? Well, it matters first of all because it was a massive judicial victory for the burgeoning civil rights movement. The movement, which really began picking up steam in the 1950s, sought all kinds of legislative and judicial acts which would acknowledge the equality of black and white Americans, and the Brown case was a massive step in that direction.

However, as you can probably imagine, many of the southern states for whom school segregation was the norm resisted integration mightily. Unfortunately, these states were given some license to do so because of the vague wording of the Supreme Court's decision. The court ordered that schools be integrated with "all deliberate speed," and while we understand exactly what they meant by that -- like, do it now -- southerners found just enough latitude in that phrase to stall. "All right, let's go let's get those schools integrated now. Well, when it comes to speed, we would like to obey the dictate to the Supreme Court and be very deliberate about it. So y'all let us alone while we go put some real time into figuring out how fast we can rightly go."

Anyway, while the Brown decision was in fact a great victory on paper, it was quite a while before schools were integrated. But that's a video for another time.
