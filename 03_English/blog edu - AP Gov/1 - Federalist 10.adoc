well hey there and welcome back to heimlich's history. in this video we're continuing to look at the foundational documents 基础文献 for ap government and that means it's time to talk about federalist number 10. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milked violence of faction style （以解决派别纷争的方式获取知识）, well then let's get to it. +

so since this is our first document from the federalist papers 联邦党人文集, let me give you a quick introduction to what this series of essays was. during the ratification debates 批准辩论 over the new constitution, john jay, alexander hamilton, and james madison -- who represented the federalists 联邦党人 who were very much in favor of 支持 the new constitution -- published essays in a new york newspaper in order to convince the public to ratify 批准（宪法）. in doing so, they addressed 回应 the most common objections to this new form of government and gave a sense of how the nation would work under this new constitution. +

okay so federalist 10 is james madison's attempt to answer the following question: how will the new constitution protect the liberty of citizens against the tyranny of the majority 多数人的暴政? now remember the framers of the constitution 宪法的制定者 were emphatically  emphatically not fans of pure democracy 纯粹民主, and in this case it's because in a pure democracy the majority will always win out over 胜过 the minority, and thus there is no protection from minority views 少数派观点. and by the way when i say minority here, i'm not talking about ethnic minorities 少数民族 but rather a smaller number of citizens -- like the opposite of majority. +

so madison comes out of the gates 一开始 talking about the dangers of factions 派别；派系, and that is a key word you need to associate with federalist 10. he says: "among the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed union 构建良好的联盟, none deserves to be more accurately developed than his tendency to break and control the violence of faction." so factions are such a threat to liberty 自由 that madison uses the word violence 暴力 to describe their actions. +

now what does madison mean by the word faction? well he goes on to define it: "by a faction i understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to 总计；相当于 a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated 驱使 by some common impulse of passion or of interest adverse to 不利于 the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community 社会的长远和整体利益." in other words, a faction is a group of citizens whose desires to dominate government so that they might impose their own interests on the whole society 将自身利益强加于整个社会. and to madison as well as to the anti-federalists, this is a great danger. +

now the anti-federalists would not agree with madison's solution -- and we'll see that in the video on brutus one -- but for now what is madison's solution to the violence of faction? well he proposes two possible solutions: "there are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction 消除派别的危害: the one by removing its causes, and the other by controlling its effects." so the two options available are: one, stop the factions from ever forming; and two, let them try to form and then limit their power. +

he says that if we're going with number one -- to remove the causes of factions -- that is a terrible option. why? because that will necessarily destroy liberty: "it could never be more truly said than of the first remedy that it was worse than the disease. liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an ailment 疾病 without which it instantly expires 消亡. but it could not be less folly 愚蠢 to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction 滋养派别 than it would be to wish the annihilation 消灭 of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency 赋予火破坏力." to destroy liberty in service of controlling factions is worse than having factions in the first place. +

the other way to remove the causes of factions -- to make sure that every citizen has the same opinions on everything -- but as anyone who's been alive for more than five minutes knows, that is not possible. madison tell us why: "as long as the reason of man continues fallible 易错的, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed." okay so removing the causes of faction won't work. +

so madison suggests that the only protection against their tyranny 暴政 is to control their effects, and the best way to do that is through a republican-style government 共和制政府 as opposed to 而不是 a pure democracy: "a republic, by which i mean a government in which the scheme of representation 代议制 takes place, opens a different prospect 前景 and promises the cure for which we are seeking." +

okay so how does a republican-style government laid out in the constitution solve the problem of factions? well it mainly has to do with 与……有关 the size and diversity of the nation. madison says that as the nation grows in population: "you take in a greater variety of parties and interests. you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens. or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other 彼此一致行动." and so the result of that is: "playing the influence of factious leaders 派系领导人 may kindle aflame 点燃 within their particular states, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration 大火灾；大动乱 to the other states." +

now in case you didn't catch it, madison's solution to the danger of factions is this: as more people are added to the nations, more and more factions will necessarily forms, and that has two consequences 后果. first, with so many factions their power will be diluted 削弱 so that no one faction can always get their way 随心所欲. and second, because they're all in competition with one another, they will be forced to compromise their interest 牺牲利益 in order to pass legislation that considers the common good of society 社会公共利益 and not merely the interests of one group. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆利希（Heimlich）历史课。在这个视频中，我们将继续研究美国大学预修课程政府学的基础文件，这意味着我们要谈谈《联邦党人文集》第十篇（Federalist number 10）。所以，如果你准备好以“派系暴力”的方式汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

既然这是《联邦党人文集》中的第一篇文件，让我快速介绍一下这一系列文章。在关于新宪法的批准辩论中，约翰·杰伊（John Jay）、亚历山大·汉密尔顿（Alexander Hamilton）和詹姆斯·麦迪逊（James Madison）——他们代表着非常支持新宪法的联邦党人——在纽约的一家报纸上发表文章，以说服公众批准新宪法。通过这样做，他们回应了对这种新政府形式最常见的反对意见，并阐述了在这部新宪法下国家将如何运作。 +

好的，《联邦党人文集》第十篇是詹姆斯·麦迪逊试图回答以下问题：新宪法将如何保护公民的自由，使其免受多数人的暴政？记住，宪法的制定者们明确不喜欢纯粹的民主，在这种情况下，是因为在纯粹的民主制度下，多数人总是会战胜少数人，因此少数人的观点得不到保护。顺便说一下，我这里说的“少数人”，不是指少数民族，而是指数量较少的公民——与“多数人”相反。 +

所以麦迪逊一开始就谈到了派系的危害，“派系”这个词是你需要与《联邦党人文集》第十篇联系起来的关键词。他说：“在一个构建良好的联盟所带来的众多优势中，没有什么比它抑制和控制派系暴力的倾向更值得准确阐述了。” 所以派系对自由构成了如此大的威胁，以至于麦迪逊用“暴力”这个词来描述他们的行为。 +

那么麦迪逊所说的“派系”是什么意思呢？嗯，他接着给出了定义：“我所说的派系，是指一定数量的公民，无论是占全体公民的多数还是少数，他们为某种共同的激情或利益冲动所驱使而联合起来，这种激情或利益与其他公民的权利或整个社会的永久和总体利益是对立的。” 换句话说，派系是一群公民，他们渴望控制政府，以便将自己的利益强加于整个社会。对麦迪逊以及反联邦党人来说，这是一个巨大的危险。 +

反联邦党人不同意麦迪逊的解决方案——我们将在关于《布鲁图斯》第一篇的视频中看到这一点——但目前麦迪逊对派系暴力的解决方案是什么呢？嗯，他提出了两种可能的解决方案：“有两种方法可以消除派系的危害：一种是消除派系的根源，另一种是控制派系的影响。” 所以有两个选择：一是阻止派系的形成；二是让它们形成，然后限制它们的权力。 +

他说，如果我们选择第一种方法——消除派系的根源——那是一个糟糕的选择。为什么呢？因为这必然会破坏自由：“对于第一种补救措施，再没有比这更真实的说法了，即它比弊病本身更糟糕。自由对于派系来说，就像空气对于火一样，没有空气，火就会立即熄灭。但是，因为自由滋养了派系就废除对政治生活至关重要的自由，就如同因为空气赋予火破坏力就希望消灭对动物生命至关重要的空气一样愚蠢。” 为了控制派系而破坏自由，比一开始就存在派系还要糟糕。 +

另一种消除派系根源的方法——确保每个公民在所有事情上都有相同的意见——但任何在世超过五分钟的人都知道，这是不可能的。麦迪逊告诉我们原因：“只要人类的理性仍然容易犯错，并且人们有自由运用理性，就会形成不同的意见。” 好吧，消除派系的根源是行不通的。 +

所以麦迪逊建议，防止派系暴政的唯一办法是控制它们的影响，而做到这一点的最佳方式是通过共和制政府，而不是纯粹的民主制度：“我所说的共和制政府，是指实行代议制的政府，它展现出了不同的前景，并有望解决我们所面临的问题。” +

好的，那么宪法中所规定的共和制政府是如何解决派系问题的呢？嗯，这主要与国家的规模和多样性有关。麦迪逊说，随着国家人口的增长：“会纳入更多种类的政党和利益群体。这样一来，整个国家的多数人有共同动机去侵犯其他公民权利的可能性就会降低。或者说，如果存在这样的共同动机，那么所有有这种动机的人要发现自身力量并彼此协调行动也会更加困难。” 所以结果是：“派系领袖的影响力可能会在他们所在的特定州引发动乱，但无法将一场全面的动荡扩散到其他州。” +

万一你没理解，麦迪逊对派系危险的解决方案是这样的：随着国家人口的增加，必然会形成越来越多的派系，这会产生两个后果。首先，由于派系众多，它们的权力会被稀释，这样就没有一个派系能够总是为所欲为。其次，因为它们都在相互竞争，所以它们将被迫妥协自己的利益，以便通过考虑社会共同利益的立法，而不仅仅是某一个群体的利益。 +
