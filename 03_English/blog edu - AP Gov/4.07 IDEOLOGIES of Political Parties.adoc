Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we'll be going through Unit 4 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video that means it's time to talk about the ideologies 意识形态 of the two major political parties 主要政党 of America -- the Republicans 共和党 and the Democrats 民主党. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked party style, well then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how ideologies of the two major parties shape policy debates 政策辩论. Okay, so that means before we start talking about individual parties, we need to understand political ideology 政治意识形态. Political ideology is an interlocking 相互关联的 set of ideas that form the basis for 构成…的基础 political decision-making 政治决策. And although what I'm about to say is a simplified version 简化版本 of reality, political ideologies basically follow along a spectrum 范围 between liberal 自由派的 and conservative ideology 保守派的. +

Now conservative ideology 保守主义 emphasizes traditional social structures 传统社会结构 and existing structures of authority 现存权力结构. Conservatives tend to emphasize limited government 有限政府 in public affairs 公共事务, strong stances 强硬立场 on crime and punishment 犯罪与惩罚, and champion 支持 states' rights 州权 over federal power 联邦权力. Or to say it another way, conservatives look at what exists and say "if it ain't broke don't fix it" （俚语：如果没坏，就别修它）. +

Liberal ideology 自由主义, on the other hand, emphasizes civil rights 公民权利 for the marginalized 边缘化群体 and supports the efforts of social justice movements 社会正义运动 to ensure that everyone has equal access to 平等享有 civil liberties 公民自由. Additionally, liberals tend to emphasize government involvement 政府干预 in public affairs, which would include care for the poor 照顾穷人 and regulations on businesses 对企业的监管 and intervention in the economy 经济干预. Or to say it another way, liberals look at what exists and says "uh, it is broke so let's fix it" （俚语：它坏了，所以我们来修一下）. +

Now there's a third ideology you should know, namely libertarian ideology 自由意志主义, but we're gonna look at that in another video. For our purposes here, we're just sticking to 坚持 conservative and liberal ideology. +

Okay, let's turn the corner 转换话题 and talk about the two major political parties in America and how they align with 与…一致 the ideologies we just talked about. The Republican Party 共和党, often referred to as 被称为 the GOP or the Grand Old Party, most closely aligns with conservative ideology 保守主义. And the way that you know that is by looking at their party platform 党纲, which is a set of policy goals 政策目标 published by the party which tells you the kinds of legislation 立法 they would pursue 推行 should their candidate win an election. +

So if you look at the Republican platform, you can see conservative ideology dang near 几乎 everywhere. Here in the section on the economy, they say "government cannot create prosperity though government can limit or destroy," and that is a conservative belief -- get the government out of the economy 减少政府对经济的干预, deregulate businesses 放松对企业的管制, and let the free market 自由市场 take care of the economy. In the section on what a constitutional government 宪政政府 should look like, they say this about the family: "Traditional marriage and family based on marriage between one man and one woman is the foundation for a free society and has for millennia 几千年 been entrusted with 被赋予 rearing children 养育孩子 and instilling cultural values 灌输文化价值观." So again there you have conservative ideology reaching backwards 追溯 to establish traditions 确立传统 and seeking to uphold them 维护传统 -- "if it ain't broke don't fix it." +

Additionally, the Republicans when it comes to social programs 社会项目 style themselves as 把自己塑造为 the party of personal responsibility 个人责任之党. So it's no surprise to see that reflected in their platform: "In the section about social welfare programs 社会福利项目: by making welfare a benefit instead of an entitlement 福利应是一种补助而非应得权利, our policies put millions of recipients 接受者 on a transition from dependence to independence." And the Republicans also regard themselves as tough on crime 对犯罪采取强硬态度. For example, they say: "To honor the sacrifice of police officers 警察, we recommit ourselves as individuals and as a party to the rule of law 法治 and the pursuit of justice 追求正义." +

So I only gave you a sample of the platform, but you can see that Republicans generally hold to 坚持 conservative ideology. Okay, now let's have a look at some of the examples of liberal ideology in the platform of the Democratic Party 民主党. And honestly, you really only need to look at the table of contents 目录 to see the liberal ideology in this platform. Look here and you see they want to level the economic playing field 创造公平的经济竞争环境. They want to do that by ending poverty 消除贫困 and breaking up corporate concentration 打破企业垄断. Here you have universal affordable quality healthcare 全民负担得起的优质医疗保健, which would of course require significant government intervention 政府大规模干预. Under "Healing the Soul of America," the Democrats want to fight for women's rights 女权, LGBTQ+ rights, disability rights 残障人士权利, indigenous tribal nations 原住民部落权利, etc. So just with the perusal 浏览 of the table of contents, you can see the liberal ideology that animates 驱动 the Democratic Party. +

But there's probably no better example of this in the platform than the preamble 序言 where it says: "Americans believe that diversity 多样性 is our greatest strength, that protest 抗议 is among the highest forms of patriotism 爱国主义." In other words, "it is broke so let's protest and fix it." +

Okay, so you have a sense of how each party's platform is informed by 受…影响 either conservative or liberal ideology. But I need to say one more thing about all of this: don't make the mistake of putting an equal sign between the Republican Party and conservative ideology or between the Democratic Party and liberal ideology. The reality, as always, is a little more complex 复杂的. Some Republicans consider themselves conservative on some points but more liberal on others, and vice versa 反之亦然 with the Democrats. So you just need to get it in your mind the direction that each party leans 倾向, and you'll be fine as long as you remember that the party is not an exact synonym for the ideology 政党与意识形态并非完全等同. +

Okay, thanks for watching. Click right here to grab my review packet to get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. No matter what ideology you subscribe to 认同, I am here to help. So if you want me to keep making these videos, then by all means subscribe 订阅 and I shall oblige 照办. Heimler out. +

== 中文释义


嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们即将学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第四单元，在这个视频中，意味着是时候讨论美国两大政党——共和党（Republicans）和民主党（Democrats）的意识形态了。所以，如果你准备好以独特的方式汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释两大政党的意识形态如何影响政策辩论。好的，这意味着在我们开始讨论各个政党之前，我们需要理解政治意识形态。政治意识形态是一组相互关联的理念，它构成了政治决策的基础。虽然我接下来要说的是对现实的简化版本，但政治意识形态基本上处于自由主义和保守主义意识形态之间的光谱上。 +

保守主义意识形态强调传统的社会结构和现有的权威结构。保守主义者倾向于强调在公共事务中政府权力有限，对犯罪和惩罚持强硬立场，并支持州权高于联邦权力。换句话说，保守主义者看待现存事物时会说 “如果东西没坏，就别去修理它”。 +

另一方面，自由主义意识形态强调边缘化群体的公民权利，并支持社会正义运动的努力，以确保每个人都能平等地享有公民自由。此外，自由主义者倾向于强调政府对公共事务的参与，这包括照顾穷人、对企业进行监管以及对经济进行干预。换句话说，自由主义者看待现存事物时会说 “嗯，东西坏了，所以我们来修理它”。 +

现在还有第三种意识形态你应该了解，即自由意志主义意识形态（libertarian ideology），但我们会在另一个视频中探讨它。就我们目前的目的而言，我们只关注保守主义和自由主义意识形态。 +

好的，让我们接着讨论美国的两大政党，以及它们与我们刚刚谈到的意识形态是如何契合的。共和党（The Republican Party），常被称为GOP（Grand Old Party），与保守主义意识形态最为契合。你可以通过查看他们的党纲（party platform）来了解这一点，党纲是该党发布的一系列政策目标，它告诉你如果他们的候选人赢得选举，他们将推行的立法类型。 +

所以，如果你查看共和党的党纲，你几乎在各处都能看到保守主义意识形态。在关于经济的部分，他们说 “政府不能创造繁荣，但政府可以限制或破坏繁荣”，这是一种保守主义信念——让政府远离经济，解除对企业的管制，让自由市场来管理经济。在关于宪政政府应该是什么样的部分，他们对家庭的看法是：“基于一男一女婚姻的传统婚姻和家庭是自由社会的基础，几千年来，它一直被委以养育子女和灌输文化价值观的重任。” 所以，你再次看到保守主义意识形态追溯传统并寻求维护传统——“如果东西没坏，就别去修理它”。 +

此外，在社会项目方面，共和党人将自己塑造为强调个人责任的政党。所以在他们的党纲中看到这样的内容并不奇怪：“在关于社会福利项目的部分：通过将福利变成一种益处而非一种应享权利，我们的政策让数百万福利领取者从依赖走向独立。” 而且共和党人还认为自己对犯罪采取强硬态度。例如，他们说：“为了纪念警察的牺牲，我们个人以及作为一个政党，再次致力于法治和对正义的追求。” +

所以我只给你看了党纲的一部分，但你可以看到共和党总体上秉持保守主义意识形态。好的，现在让我们看看民主党（Democratic Party）党纲中自由主义意识形态的一些例子。老实说，你只需要看看目录就能在党纲中看到自由主义意识形态。看看这里，你会看到他们想要在经济上创造公平竞争的环境。他们想通过消除贫困和打破企业垄断来实现这一点。这里有全民可负担的优质医疗保健，这当然需要政府的大量干预。在 “治愈美国的灵魂” 这一部分，民主党人想要为妇女权利、LGBTQ+ 权利、残疾人权利、原住民部落等而奋斗。所以，仅仅浏览一下目录，你就能看到激发民主党理念的自由主义意识形态。 +

但在党纲中，可能没有比前言更好的例子了，前言中说：“美国人相信多样性是我们最大的优势，抗议是爱国主义的最高形式之一。” 换句话说，“东西坏了，所以我们抗议并修复它”。 +

好的，现在你对每个政党的党纲如何受到保守主义或自由主义意识形态的影响有了一定的了解。但关于这一切我还需要说一点：不要错误地在共和党和保守主义意识形态之间，或者在民主党和自由主义意识形态之间划等号。现实情况一如既往地更为复杂。一些共和党人在某些方面认为自己是保守主义者，但在其他方面更倾向于自由主义，民主党人也是如此。所以你只需要记住每个政党的倾向方向，只要你记住政党并不完全等同于意识形态，就没问题了。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取我的复习资料包，帮助你在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分。无论你支持哪种意识形态，我都会在这里提供帮助。所以如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那么一定要订阅，我会照做的。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +
