Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through 经历；浏览 Unit 1 of the AP Government curriculum 课程体系, and in this video, it's time to talk about a foundational principle 基本原则 of American government -- namely 也就是；即, separation of powers 三权分立 and checks and balances 制衡. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked （一种形象表达，可理解为激发思维、获取知识）within, let's get to it. +

So in this video, we're going to try to do two things. First, explain the constitutional principles 宪法原则 of separation of powers and checks and balances. And then second, explain the implications 影响；意义 of separation of powers and checks and balances for the U.S. political system 美国政治体系. Okay, so two things: the separation of powers, and what that means for our political system. +

So let's begin with separation of powers. What does that mean? Well, it means that power is... separated. Anyway, the principle of separation of powers means that no one branch of government holds all the authority 权力, and we can see how this is established in the Constitution. Instead of a unitary branch 单一部门 of the federal government -- like we had under the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例 -- the Constitution separates power into three branches: the legislative 立法的, the executive 行政的, and the judicial 司法的. +

And let's have a look at the power each of these holds. The legislative branch 立法部门 is composed of 由……组成 two houses, which together make up Congress 国会. And within Congress, you have the House of Representatives 众议院 and the Senate 参议院, which represent the people of the various states. The power given to this body 机构 is the power to propose and make laws 提议和制定法律. No other branch can do that except the legislative branch. +

The executive branch 行政部门 refers to the President of the United States and the bureaucracy 官僚机构, which is under the president's authority 管辖；权力. The power given to the executive branch is to execute the laws 执行法律 -- or, in other words, to enforce the laws 实施法律. Congress can pass laws all day long, but unless there is someone there to enforce the laws, ain't nobody gonna pay attention to them. +

The judicial branch 司法部门 refers to the Supreme Court 最高法院 -- which is the highest court in the land 国家最高司法机构 -- and the system of federal courts 联邦法院系统 scattered throughout the nation 分散在全国. The power given to this branch is to interpret the constitutionality of the laws 解释法律的合宪性, and no other branch is given that power. +

However, none of these branches has supreme power 最高权力, even in the powers that lawfully belong to them 合法属于它们的权力. And that's where the system of checks and balances comes in. In addition to 除……之外 power being separated among the various branches, each branch also has the power to check the other branches 制衡其他部门. And let me give you an example for each branch. +

The legislative branch can check the executive branch with its power of advice and consent 建议和同意权, which is a checking power specifically designated to 专门赋予 the Senate. What it means is that the Senate must vote to approve certain high-level presidential appointments 总统高级任命 -- like cabinet positions 内阁职位 or Supreme Court nominees 最高法院提名人. Additionally 此外, Congress holds the power of impeachment 弹劾权 over the president, which has the potential to remove the president from office 罢免总统职务 on account of 因为 the president acting like a turret （此处表述较为随意，可理解为总统行为不当）. And in the history of our fair nation, only three presidents have been successfully impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump -- none of which was removed from office as a result of the trial 审判. Even so, impeachment demonstrates the checking power Congress has over the president. +

The president, on the other hand 另一方面, has power to check Congress. And the main way the president does that is by the veto 否决权, which is a power granted to 授予 the president by Article 2, Section 7 of the Constitution. Now remember, for a bill 法案 to become a law, the last step is to have it signed by the president. But if the president doesn't like the law -- either because it's unjust 不公正的 or just doesn't jive with 符合；一致 the presidential policy agenda 总统政策议程 -- then the president can veto the law, and it gets sent back to Congress to start all over again. +

However, Congress does have the power to check the president's checking power in the veto. If the president vetoes a bill, Congress can override that veto 推翻否决 with a two-thirds vote 三分之二多数票. And if they can muster 召集；集合 that much support, then the bill becomes a law without the presidential signature. +

And then the judicial branch has some checking power of its own. Probably the most significant example is the court's power of judicial review 司法审查权, which -- although it's not in the Constitution -- was established very early on 很早就确立了. And basically, it just means that the court has the power to declare laws passed by Congress unconstitutional 违宪的 and therefore null and void 无效的. +

So you can see the principle of separation of powers and checks and balances in our governmental system. Now the question is: Why did the framers 制定者 of the Constitution make it this way? After all 毕竟, this is a very slow system. It can often take a long time to get things done. Like, if you just concentrated all those powers in one person, that guy would get things done quick, fast, and in a hurry: +

"My fellow Americans, I am here to inform you that we are going to a 90% income tax rate, because -- as you may or may not know -- those gold-plated toilets in my private jet ain't going to pay for themselves." +

Well, if you want to know why our system -- slow as it is -- is better than that, then let's have a look at one of our foundational documents 基础文件: Federalist 51 联邦党人文集第51篇. And just like every required document in this course, I have a whole deep-dive video 深度解析视频 on it, so you can check that out for more information. But for now, we just want to emphasize that in Federalist 51, the argument goes like this: Separation of powers and checks and balances are able to control the abuse of power 滥用权力 by any one branch. And if this protection is going to work, then each branch has to work as independently of the others as possible, but also possess the necessary checking powers to keep the others in their lane 各司其职. +

In fact, in Federalist 51, the chief danger to the flourishing 繁荣 of the new republic would be investing too much power in one branch above the others. So that's why -- despite how slow it can be -- the framers took great care to invest each branch with roughly equal power 大致相等的权力 and to give each branch power to check the others. +

Okay, now there's one more thing you need to know in this topic, and that's the various access points 不同途径 available to stakeholders 利益相关者 in our system of government. Now, a stakeholder refers to 指；意指 anyone with a vested interest 既得利益 in the outcome of policymaking 政策制定结果. And in a system of government like ours, we the people are the stakeholders, since we are the ones who will be affected by the outcome of legislation 立法结果. +

So it's going to be very important for you to understand how stakeholders have access to speak into 参与；表达意见 the work of each branch of government. In the legislative branch, stakeholders can speak into the law-making process in various ways. For example, interest groups 利益集团 can pay professional lobbyists 专业说客 to meet with representatives in order to make them aware of the group's causes 诉求 and try to persuade them to vote in the group's interests 按利益集团的利益投票. But outside of interest groups, average citizens 普通公民 can write letters or emails to the representatives. +

And in the executive branch, stakeholders have influence too. And you know, you can't really just call up the Oval Office 椭圆形办公室（代指白宫） and tell the president what you think, but average citizens do have access to the bureaucratic agencies 官僚机构 run by the executive branch. Stakeholders can file a complaint 提出投诉 with these agencies if a law is being broken or if a crime is being committed. +

In the judicial branch, stakeholders can use the courts to challenge unjust and unconstitutional laws 挑战不公正和违宪的法律 or appeal wrongful convictions 上诉错误的定罪. So the point is, in all of these branches of government, we don't just put all the people in power and set them on their merry way 放任不管. Average citizens -- like you and me -- have means by which we can influence and interact with the process of governance 治理过程. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。我们一直在学习AP政府课程的第一单元，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈美国政府的一个基本原则 —— 即三权分立和制衡。所以，如果你准备好开动脑筋获取知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

在这个视频中，我们要尝试做两件事。第一，解释三权分立和制衡的宪法原则。第二，解释三权分立和制衡对美国政治制度的影响。好的，就是这两件事：三权分立，以及它对我们政治制度的意义。 +

那我们从三权分立开始讲。这意味着什么呢？嗯，这意味着权力被…… 分开。总之，三权分立原则意味着政府没有一个分支拥有所有权力，我们可以从宪法中看到它是如何确立的。与《邦联条例》下的单一政府分支不同，宪法将权力分为三个分支：立法分支、行政分支和司法分支。 +

我们来看看每个分支所拥有的权力。立法分支由两院组成，它们共同构成了国会（Congress）。在国会内部，有众议院（the House of Representatives）和参议院（the Senate），它们代表着各个州的人民。赋予这个机构的权力是提出并制定法律。除了立法分支，没有其他分支能做到这一点。 +

行政分支指的是美国总统（the President of the United States）以及处于总统权力之下的官僚机构（the bureaucracy）。赋予行政分支的权力是执行法律 —— 换句话说，就是实施法律。国会可以不断地通过法律，但除非有人去执行这些法律，否则没人会理会它们。 +

司法分支指的是最高法院（the Supreme Court） —— 它是这个国家的最高法庭，以及遍布全国的联邦法院（the system of federal courts）体系。赋予这个分支的权力是解释法律的合宪性，而且没有其他分支拥有这项权力。 +

然而，这些分支都没有至高无上的权力，即使是在合法属于它们的权力方面。这就是制衡体系发挥作用的地方。除了权力在各个分支之间进行分配之外，每个分支还拥有制衡其他分支的权力。我给你举每个分支的例子。 +

立法分支可以利用其 “建议和同意” 的权力来制衡行政分支，这是专门赋予参议院的一项制衡权力。这意味着参议院必须投票批准某些高级别的总统任命，比如内阁职位或最高法院的提名人选。此外，国会拥有弹劾总统的权力，这有可能以总统行为不当为由将总统免职。在我们这个美好国家的历史上，只有三位总统被成功弹劾：安德鲁·约翰逊（Andrew Johnson）、比尔·克林顿（Bill Clinton）和唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump），但他们都没有因为弹劾审判而被免职。即便如此，弹劾体现了国会对总统的制衡权力。 +

另一方面，总统有权制衡国会。总统这样做的主要方式是行使否决权，这是宪法第二条第七款赋予总统的权力。记住，一项法案要成为法律，最后一步是由总统签署。但是如果总统不喜欢这项法律，要么是因为它不公正，要么是因为它与总统的政策议程不符，那么总统可以否决这项法案，然后它会被送回国会，一切又要重新开始。 +

然而，国会有权制衡总统的否决权。如果总统否决了一项法案，国会可以以三分之二的票数推翻总统的否决。如果他们能获得那么多的支持，那么这项法案即使没有总统的签署也能成为法律。 +

然后，司法分支也有自己的制衡权力。可能最显著的例子是法院的司法审查权，虽然这在宪法中没有明确规定，但很早就确立了。基本上，这意味着法院有权宣布国会通过的法律违宪，因此无效。 +

所以你可以看到我们政府体系中的三权分立和制衡原则。现在的问题是：为什么宪法的制定者要把它设计成这样呢？毕竟，这是一个非常缓慢的体系。很多时候，完成一件事可能需要很长时间。比如，如果你把所有权力都集中在一个人身上，那个人可以迅速地把事情做完：

“我的美国同胞们，我在这要告诉你们，我们要把所得税率提高到90%，因为 —— 不管你们知不知道 —— 我私人飞机上那些镀金的马桶可不会自己买单。”

嗯，如果你想知道为什么我们这个虽然缓慢但比上述情况更好的体系是这样的，那我们来看看我们的一份基础文件：《联邦党人文集》第51篇（Federalist 51）。就像本课程中所有要求掌握的文件一样，我有一个关于它的深入讲解视频，你可以去看看以获取更多信息。但现在，我们只是想强调，在《联邦党人文集》第51篇中，其论点是这样的：三权分立和制衡能够控制任何一个分支滥用权力。而且如果这种保护要起作用，那么每个分支都必须尽可能独立于其他分支运作，但同时也必须拥有必要的制衡权力，以约束其他分支。 +

事实上，在《联邦党人文集》第51篇中，对这个新共和国繁荣的主要威胁是将过多权力集中在一个分支而高于其他分支。所以这就是为什么，尽管这个体系可能很缓慢，制宪者们还是非常谨慎地赋予每个分支大致平等的权力，并赋予每个分支制衡其他分支的权力。 +

好的，在这个话题中你还需要知道一件事，那就是在我们的政府体系中，利益相关者（stakeholders）有各种途径参与其中。利益相关者指的是对政策制定结果有既得利益的任何人。在像我们这样的政府体系中，我们人民就是利益相关者，因为我们是会受到立法结果影响的人。 +

所以理解利益相关者如何对政府的每个分支的工作发声是非常重要的。在立法分支，利益相关者可以通过各种方式参与立法过程。例如，利益集团可以花钱请专业的说客与代表们会面，让他们了解该集团的诉求，并试图说服他们为该集团的利益投票。但除了利益集团之外，普通公民可以给代表们写信或发电子邮件。 +

在行政分支，利益相关者也有影响力。你知道，你不能真的直接打电话到椭圆形办公室告诉总统你的想法，但普通公民确实可以接触到由行政分支管理的官僚机构。如果法律被违反或犯罪行为发生，利益相关者可以向这些机构提出投诉。 +

在司法分支，利益相关者可以利用法院来挑战不公正和违宪的法律，或者对错误的定罪提出上诉。所以关键是，在政府的所有这些分支中，我们不是仅仅把权力赋予某些人然后让他们自行其是。像你和我这样的普通公民有办法影响并参与到治理过程中。 +

好的，这就是AP政府课程第一单元第六个话题你需要知道的内容。如果你想巩固知识，在课堂上得A并且在五月份的考试中得5分，那么点击这里获取我的复习资料包。嘿，如果你想成为这个频道的利益相关者，那么一定要订阅，让我们看看在这个世界上我们能做些什么。海姆勒下线了。 +
