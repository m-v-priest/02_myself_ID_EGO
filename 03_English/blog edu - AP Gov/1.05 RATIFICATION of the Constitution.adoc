Hey there and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through 经历；浏览 Unit 1 of the AP Government curriculum 课程体系, and in this video it's time to talk about the ratification 批准；认可 of the Constitution 宪法. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked （一种形象表达，可理解为激发思维、获取知识）with a good deal of compromise 妥协；折衷, well then let's get to it. +

Okay, in this video here's what we're aiming to do: explain the ongoing impact 持续影响 of political negotiation 政治谈判 and compromise at the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议 on the development of the constitutional system 宪法体系. Okay, so here are two things: the Constitutional Convention and the compromises necessary to create the Constitution. So let's look at each in turn 依次；轮流. +

Okay, first, the Constitutional Convention. In the last video we talked about America's first constitution, namely 即；也就是 the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例, and how basically it was kind of a hot mess 一团糟 of a governing document 管理文件 and had more weaknesses than you could shake a stick at 数不胜数；极其糟糕. So to remedy 补救；纠正 these problems, a Constitutional Convention (also known as the Philadelphia Convention) was called in 1787, and the stated purpose 宣称的目的 of this convention was to shore up 支撑；加强 the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. +

But thanks to the work of folks like Alexander Hamilton, the convention quickly became an effort in drafting 起草 a new constitution that would strengthen the federal government and eliminate 消除 the weaknesses of the Articles. If you've watched my other videos on this topic, you know that there was a terrific debate 激烈的辩论 over this new Constitution -- not only in the ratification stage 批准阶段, but also just to get the thing written and out for ratification. +

Okay, now let's have a look at some of the main compromises that you need to know from the Constitution. And by the way, the U.S. Constitution is one of your required documents for this course, so I have a whole video on it -- you can check it out right here. Here we're only going to consider the compromises embedded in 嵌入；包含于 it. +

The first compromise you need to know is the Great Compromise 大妥协, and the debate here was over how the people would be represented 代表 in the new Congress 国会. Remember, the Constitution would establish a republican-style government 共和制政府 in which representatives of the people did the work of government. So the main question was: how do we decide how many representatives each state gets? And there were two opposing solutions 对立的解决方案 to this problem. +

First was the Virginia Plan 弗吉尼亚方案, which argued that representatives ought to be apportioned 分配；分派 by population 人口数量. So in that case, bigger states would have more representatives, and smaller states would have less. And it's not hard to understand why Virginia would want a plan like that since it was among the most populous states 人口最多的州 of the union 联邦. Now on the surface 表面上 that sounds pretty fair, right? But think about it for a moment. If the big states always had more representatives, then the interests of the small states would never prevail 占上风；获胜. Like, just because of their size, the small states would never win under this system. So the Virginia Plan favored large states. +

Okay, now second was the New Jersey Plan 新泽西方案, which argued that representatives ought to be apportioned equally 平均分配 -- each state gets one vote. So in this case, small states have the advantage 优势. It's not hard to understand why. If you have two groups, and then the first group is 10 people and the second group is 10,000 people, and each one has one vote, clearly the group with 10 has way more power than the one with 10,000. And of course the big states like Virginia would lose in the system. +

So the Great Compromise took both of those plans and brought them together in a bicameral legislature 两院制立法机构, which is to say a Congress with two houses. In the House of Representatives 众议院, the people's representatives will be apportioned by population -- so big states have more and small states have less. In the Senate 参议院, representatives would be apportioned equally with each state (no matter the size) granted two senators 参议员. +

Now that debate had a lot of heat 激烈争论, but so did the compromise over how the president was going to be elected. In this debate there were again several options. Some groups argued that the president should be elected by the people. Others argued that the president should be elected by state legislatures 州立法机构. Then still others argued that Congress should be responsible for this task. And the compromise they ultimately agreed upon 最终达成一致 for presidential elections 总统选举 was the Electoral College system 选举人团制度. In this system, each state is given the same number of electors 选举人 as they have representatives in Congress, and it is the electors who put the president into office 使总统就职. Now states can make their own decisions about who those electors are going to be, but regardless 不管怎样, the presidential election is in their hands and in no one else's. +

Now there are two more compromises you need to know, and they both deal with 处理；涉及 slavery 奴隶制, which as you can imagine was a topic that got a little... uh... tense 紧张的. The first compromise on slavery was known as the Three-Fifths Compromise 五分之三妥协. The debate was over how enslaved people 被奴役的人；奴隶 would count for representation 计入代表人数 in the House of Representatives. Northern delegates 代表 to the convention said that representation ought to be reckoned by 计算；统计 the free population only. And that makes sense, right? Like, if the whole institution of slavery was, as southerners claimed, built on the fact that enslaved people were property 财产, not people, then northerners wondered why should you count them for purposes of representation? To which the southern delegates said, "Well son, don't go pointing out contradictions 矛盾 in our worldview -- that ain't polite." +

Anyway, this argument got so heated 激烈的 the southern delegates threatened to leave the convention, and if they did that, there would be no Constitution. So the compromise they eventually came to was to count three-fifths of the enslaved population for purposes of representation, and they would also count three-fifths of them for the purposes of taxation 税收 as well. So if you want more representatives, you're about to get more taxes too. +

The other compromise on slavery was about the importation 进口；引入 of slaves. Some delegates wanted to officially abolish 废除 the slave trade 奴隶贸易 in the Constitution, and those from the south -- you probably already know what they thought about that. So a deal was struck 达成协议 that the slave trade wouldn't be touched for another 20 years, after which it would be abolished (which it was in 1808). +

So those are some of the main compromises you need to know. But you also need to know that in the process of those debates (some of which almost brought the convention to the breaking point 临界点；极限), the framers 制定者；创作者 of the Constitution became convinced that a method of amending 修订；修改 the Constitution was needed. Now remember how difficult it was to amend the Articles of Confederation -- it required unanimous agreement 一致同意 from all 13 states. And even if 12 states agreed, you know who's about to come in and mess this whole thing up, right? It's always your fault. +

Anyway, the framers of the Constitution recognized the impossibility 不可能性 of the amendments under the Articles, and so laid out 制定；规划 in Article 5 of the Constitution a more attainable 可实现的；可达成的 means of amending it. So there are two stages to amending the Constitution: proposal 提议；提案 and ratification. So how is an amendment proposed? Well, either Congress can propose an amendment, or special state conventions can, and a two-thirds vote 三分之二多数票 is required to pass the amendment on to the next stage. Once that happened, the proposed amendment must be ratified or accepted by three-quarters of the states, and that can be done either by state legislatures or state ratifying conventions 州批准会议. If three-quarters of the states vote to approve, it becomes an official amendment 修正案 to the Constitution. +

And just for poops and giggles （非正式表达，为了好玩；闹着玩）, it might be helpful for you to know that the Constitution has been amended 27 times, although the first ten are the Bill of Rights 权利法案, and those were added all at once 一次性添加. +

Okay, now despite all the fighting and compromise necessary to get the Constitution in its final form 最终形式, they finally hammered it out 敲定；达成协议 and presented it to the states for ratification. And it took until 1790 for all the states to ratify. And you're never gonna guess who was the last state holding out 坚持；拒不妥协 to the last possible moment to say yes. Was it South Carolina? It wasn't South Carolina. No, it was Rhode Island. It was. +

Anyway, the debate over the role of the central government, the power of state governments, and individual rights (which essentially summarize 总结；概括 the debate of the convention) still goes on to this day. And let me just mention two areas in which we still see this debate: government surveillance 政府监控 and education. And what the curriculum is trying to get you to see here is that these debates weren't just confined to 局限于 a moment of time when the ratification of the Constitution was at stake 处于危险中 or the writing of the Constitution was at stake. These debates have followed us to this day. +

So with respect to 关于；至于 government surveillance, let's talk about what happened in the wake of 在……之后；随着……而来 the terrorist attacks 恐怖袭击 of September 11, 2001. On that day, terrorists representing the group known as al-Qaeda crashed passenger airliners 客机 into both towers of the World Trade Center in New York, another into the Pentagon 五角大楼, and another crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside. Now these men had been living in the United States, learning to fly, and coordinating 协调 their plans for upwards of 18 months. And after the attacks were carried out 实施, it was shocking to discover that these men had lived among Americans for so long. Like, how could we have missed what they were up to? +

So in order to make sure that didn't happen again, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act 美国爱国者法案, which aimed to find and stop future terrorist attacks. And hey, that's great. Well, how are they going to do that? Well, by tapping a buttload of phones 大量窃听电话 and monitoring Americans' emails. But eventually a public outcry 公众抗议 started growing regarding the PATRIOT Act and its potential to violate 违反 Fourth Amendment rights 第四修正案权利 to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures 不合理搜查和扣押. So there you have the old debate about central power versus individual rights. +

Now this debate also rages 激烈进行 around the topic of education. Now historically, education falls within the domain of 属于……范围 state authority 州政府权力, but in 2001 Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act 不让一个孩子掉队法案, which stipulated 规定 that in order to receive federal funding 联邦资金, schools would have to meet certain criteria 标准. And as it turns out 结果是, those benchmarks 基准；标准 were very much out of reach 遥不可及 for a lot of teachers and schools, and when they didn't pass muster 合格；通过检验, the federal government imposed sanctions 实施制裁 on those states. And here we have the same debate again. As states were slapped with federal sanctions 受到联邦制裁, there was an outcry from the states that this law represented way too much federal overreach 联邦权力过度扩张 into the dominion 领域；范围 of state power. +

So at the end of the day 最终；到头来, the debates which created our nation are the same debates we're still having today.

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。我们一直在学习 AP 政府课程的第 1 单元，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈《宪法》的批准过程。所以如果你准备好开动脑筋，了解其中的诸多妥协，那就开始吧。 +
在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释制宪会议上的政治谈判和妥协对宪法体系发展的持续影响。好的，这里有两件事：制宪会议以及为制定《宪法》所做的必要妥协。所以让我们依次来看。 +
首先，制宪会议。在上一个视频中，我们谈到了美国的第一部宪法，也就是《邦联条例》，并且它作为一部治理文件基本上是一团糟，缺点多到数不胜数。所以为了解决这些问题，1787 年召开了制宪会议（也被称为费城会议），这次会议的既定目的是弥补《邦联条例》的缺点。 +
但是由于亚历山大・汉密尔顿（Alexander Hamilton）等人的努力，这次会议很快变成了起草一部新宪法的工作，这部新宪法将加强联邦政府并消除《邦联条例》的缺点。如果你看过我关于这个主题的其他视频，你就会知道关于这部新《宪法》有一场激烈的辩论 —— 不仅在批准阶段，而且在起草并提交批准的过程中都有很多争议。 +
好的，现在让我们看看《宪法》中你需要知道的一些主要妥协。顺便说一下，美国《宪法》是本课程要求你掌握的文件之一，所以我有一个关于它的完整视频 —— 你可以点击这里查看。在这里我们只考虑其中包含的妥协内容。 +
你需要知道的第一个妥协是大妥协（the Great Compromise），这里的辩论是关于人民在新国会中的代表方式。记住，《宪法》将建立一个共和政体，在这个政体中人民的代表进行政府工作。所以主要问题是：我们如何决定每个州有多少代表呢？对于这个问题有两个相互对立的解决方案。 +
第一个是弗吉尼亚方案（the Virginia Plan），它主张代表应该根据人口分配。所以在这种情况下，大州将有更多的代表，小州将有更少的代表。不难理解为什么弗吉尼亚州会想要这样一个方案，因为它是联邦中人口最多的州之一。从表面上看，这听起来很公平，对吧？但仔细想想。如果大州总是有更多的代表，那么小州的利益就永远无法实现。就因为它们的规模，小州在这个体系下永远不会获胜。所以弗吉尼亚方案有利于大州。 +
第二个是新泽西方案（the New Jersey Plan），它主张代表应该平等分配 —— 每个州有一票。所以在这种情况下，小州有优势。不难理解为什么。如果你有两个群体，第一个群体有 10 个人，第二个群体有 10000 个人，而每个群体都只有一票，显然有 10 个人的群体比有 10000 个人的群体权力更大。当然，像弗吉尼亚州这样的大州在这个体系下会失败。 +
所以大妥协将这两个方案结合起来，建立了一个两院制的立法机构，也就是说国会有两个议院。在众议院（the House of Representatives），人民的代表将根据人口分配 —— 所以大州有更多代表，小州有更少代表。在参议院（the Senate），代表将平等分配，每个州（无论大小）都有两名参议员。 +
现在这场辩论非常激烈，但关于总统选举方式的妥协也是如此。在这场辩论中同样有几个选项。一些团体认为总统应该由人民选举。另一些团体认为总统应该由州立法机构选举。还有一些团体认为国会应该负责这项任务。最终他们就总统选举达成的妥协是选举人团制度（the Electoral College system）。在这个制度下，每个州获得的选举人数量与它在国会中的代表数量相同，由选举人来选举总统。各州可以自行决定这些选举人是谁，但无论如何，总统选举掌握在选举人手中，而不是其他人手中。 +
还有两个你需要知道的妥协，它们都与奴隶制有关，你可以想象，这个话题有点…… 呃…… 紧张。第一个关于奴隶制的妥协被称为五分之三妥协（the Three-Fifths Compromise）。辩论的焦点是奴隶在众议院的代表权问题。参加制宪会议的北方代表说，代表权应该只根据自由人口来计算。这是有道理的，对吧？就像，如果整个奴隶制制度，正如南方人所声称的，是建立在奴隶是财产而不是人的基础上，那么北方人就想知道为什么在代表权方面要把奴隶计算在内呢？南方代表回应说：“嘿，伙计，别指出我们世界观中的矛盾 —— 这不礼貌。” +
不管怎样，这场争论非常激烈，南方代表威胁要退出制宪会议，如果他们退出，就不会有《宪法》。所以他们最终达成的妥协是，在代表权方面，将奴隶人口的五分之三计算在内，在税收方面也是如此。所以如果你想要更多的代表权，你也会面临更多的税收。 +
另一个关于奴隶制的妥协是关于奴隶的进口问题。一些代表希望在《宪法》中正式废除奴隶贸易，而来自南方的代表 —— 你可能已经知道他们对此的看法。所以达成的协议是，在接下来的 20 年里不触及奴隶贸易，20 年后废除它（奴隶贸易在 1808 年被废除了）。 +
所以这些是你需要知道的一些主要妥协。但你也需要知道，在这些辩论的过程中（其中一些辩论几乎使制宪会议破裂），《宪法》的制定者们开始相信需要一种修改《宪法》的方法。记住修改《邦联条例》有多难 —— 需要 13 个州的一致同意。即使有 12 个州同意，你知道谁会出来搅局，对吧？总是有这样的情况。 +
不管怎样，《宪法》的制定者们认识到在《邦联条例》下修改的不可能性，所以在《宪法》的第五条中规定了一种更可行的修改方法。所以修改《宪法》有两个阶段：提案和批准。那么如何提出修正案呢？嗯，要么国会可以提出修正案，要么特别的州制宪会议可以提出修正案，并且需要三分之二的票数才能将修正案推进到下一阶段。一旦提出修正案，必须得到四分之三的州的批准，这可以通过州立法机构或州批准会议来实现。如果四分之三的州投票批准，它就成为《宪法》的正式修正案。 +
只是为了好玩，你可能想知道《宪法》已经被修正了 27 次，不过前十个修正案是《权利法案》（the Bill of Rights），它们是一次性添加的。 +
好的，尽管为了使《宪法》最终成型经历了所有的争论和妥协，他们最终还是敲定了《宪法》并提交给各州批准。直到 1790 年所有的州才批准了《宪法》。你绝对猜不到最后一个坚持到最后才同意的州是哪个。是南卡罗来纳州（South Carolina）吗？不是南卡罗来纳州。不，是罗德岛（Rhode Island）。就是它。 +
不管怎样，关于中央政府的角色、州政府的权力以及个人权利的辩论（这些基本上总结了制宪会议的辩论）至今仍在继续。让我举两个我们仍然能看到这种辩论的领域：政府监控和教育。课程希望你明白，这些辩论不仅仅局限于《宪法》批准或制定的那个时刻。这些辩论一直伴随着我们直到今天。 +
所以关于政府监控，让我们谈谈 2001 年 9 月 11 日恐怖袭击之后发生的事情。在那一天，代表基地组织（al-Qaeda）的恐怖分子驾驶客机撞向了纽约世贸中心的两座塔楼，另一架撞向了五角大楼，还有一架坠毁在宾夕法尼亚州的乡村。这些人在美国生活，学习飞行，并协调他们的计划长达 18 个月之久。在袭击发生后，令人震惊的是发现这些人在美国生活了这么久。我们怎么会没发现他们在做什么呢？ +
所以为了确保这种情况不再发生，国会通过了《美国爱国者法案》（the USA PATRIOT Act），其目的是发现并阻止未来的恐怖袭击。嘿，这听起来不错。那么他们要怎么做呢？嗯，通过监听大量的电话和监控美国人的电子邮件。但最终，公众对《爱国者法案》及其可能侵犯第四修正案中关于不受不合理搜查和扣押的权利的行为发出了抗议。所以这就是关于中央权力与个人权利的古老辩论。 +
现在这场辩论也围绕教育这个话题激烈展开。从历史上看，教育属于州政府的权力范围，但在 2001 年，国会通过了《不让一个孩子掉队法案》（the No Child Left Behind Act），该法案规定，为了获得联邦资金，学校必须满足某些标准。结果是，这些标准对很多教师和学校来说遥不可及，当他们没有达到标准时，联邦政府对这些州实施了制裁。在这里我们又看到了同样的辩论。当各州受到联邦制裁时，各州抗议说这项法律代表着联邦对州权力领域的过度干涉。 +
所以归根结底，创建我们国家的那些辩论至今仍在继续。好了，这就是 AP 政府课程第 1 单元第 5 个 topic 你需要知道的内容。如果你需要帮助在课堂上得 A 并且在五月份的考试中得 5 分，点击这里获取一份复习资料包。如果你希望我继续为你制作这些视频，那就订阅来告诉我吧。海姆勒下线了。 +

Hey there and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 1 of the AP Government curriculum, and in this video it's time to talk about the ratification of the Constitution. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a good deal of compromise, well then let's get to it.

Okay, in this video here's what we're aiming to do: explain the ongoing impact of political negotiation and compromise at the Constitutional Convention on the development of the constitutional system. Okay, so here are two things: the Constitutional Convention and the compromises necessary to create the Constitution. So let's look at each in turn.

Okay, first, the Constitutional Convention. In the last video we talked about America's first constitution, namely the Articles of Confederation, and how basically it was kind of a hot mess of a governing document and had more weaknesses than you could shake a stick at. So to remedy these problems, a Constitutional Convention (also known as the Philadelphia Convention) was called in 1787, and the stated purpose of this convention was to shore up the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.

But thanks to the work of folks like Alexander Hamilton, the convention quickly became an effort in drafting a new constitution that would strengthen the federal government and eliminate the weaknesses of the Articles. If you've watched my other videos on this topic, you know that there was a terrific debate over this new Constitution -- not only in the ratification stage, but also just to get the thing written and out for ratification.

Okay, now let's have a look at some of the main compromises that you need to know from the Constitution. And by the way, the U.S. Constitution is one of your required documents for this course, so I have a whole video on it -- you can check it out right here. Here we're only going to consider the compromises embedded in it.

The first compromise you need to know is the Great Compromise, and the debate here was over how the people would be represented in the new Congress. Remember, the Constitution would establish a republican-style government in which representatives of the people did the work of government. So the main question was: how do we decide how many representatives each state gets? And there were two opposing solutions to this problem.

First was the Virginia Plan, which argued that representatives ought to be apportioned by population. So in that case, bigger states would have more representatives, and smaller states would have less. And it's not hard to understand why Virginia would want a plan like that since it was among the most populous states of the union. Now on the surface that sounds pretty fair, right? But think about it for a moment. If the big states always had more representatives, then the interests of the small states would never prevail. Like, just because of their size, the small states would never win under this system. So the Virginia Plan favored large states.

Okay, now second was the New Jersey Plan, which argued that representatives ought to be apportioned equally -- each state gets one vote. So in this case, small states have the advantage. It's not hard to understand why. If you have two groups, and then the first group is 10 people and the second group is 10,000 people, and each one has one vote, clearly the group with 10 has way more power than the one with 10,000. And of course the big states like Virginia would lose in the system.

So the Great Compromise took both of those plans and brought them together in a bicameral legislature, which is to say a Congress with two houses. In the House of Representatives, the people's representatives will be apportioned by population -- so big states have more and small states have less. In the Senate, representatives would be apportioned equally with each state (no matter the size) granted two senators.

Now that debate had a lot of heat, but so did the compromise over how the president was going to be elected. In this debate there were again several options. Some groups argued that the president should be elected by the people. Others argued that the president should be elected by state legislatures. Then still others argued that Congress should be responsible for this task. And the compromise they ultimately agreed upon for presidential elections was the Electoral College system. In this system, each state is given the same number of electors as they have representatives in Congress, and it is the electors who put the president into office. Now states can make their own decisions about who those electors are going to be, but regardless, the presidential election is in their hands and in no one else's.

Now there are two more compromises you need to know, and they both deal with slavery, which as you can imagine was a topic that got a little... uh... tense. The first compromise on slavery was known as the Three-Fifths Compromise. The debate was over how enslaved people would count for representation in the House of Representatives. Northern delegates to the convention said that representation ought to be reckoned by the free population only. And that makes sense, right? Like, if the whole institution of slavery was, as southerners claimed, built on the fact that enslaved people were property, not people, then northerners wondered why should you count them for purposes of representation? To which the southern delegates said, "Well son, don't go pointing out contradictions in our worldview -- that ain't polite."

Anyway, this argument got so heated the southern delegates threatened to leave the convention, and if they did that, there would be no Constitution. So the compromise they eventually came to was to count three-fifths of the enslaved population for purposes of representation, and they would also count three-fifths of them for the purposes of taxation as well. So if you want more representatives, you're about to get more taxes too.

The other compromise on slavery was about the importation of slaves. Some delegates wanted to officially abolish the slave trade in the Constitution, and those from the south -- you probably already know what they thought about that. So a deal was struck that the slave trade wouldn't be touched for another 20 years, after which it would be abolished (which it was in 1808).

So those are some of the main compromises you need to know. But you also need to know that in the process of those debates (some of which almost brought the convention to the breaking point), the framers of the Constitution became convinced that a method of amending the Constitution was needed. Now remember how difficult it was to amend the Articles of Confederation -- it required unanimous agreement from all 13 states. And even if 12 states agreed, you know who's about to come in and mess this whole thing up, right? It's always your fault.

Anyway, the framers of the Constitution recognized the impossibility of the amendments under the Articles, and so laid out in Article 5 of the Constitution a more attainable means of amending it. So there are two stages to amending the Constitution: proposal and ratification. So how is an amendment proposed? Well, either Congress can propose an amendment, or special state conventions can, and a two-thirds vote is required to pass the amendment on to the next stage. Once that happened, the proposed amendment must be ratified or accepted by three-quarters of the states, and that can be done either by state legislatures or state ratifying conventions. If three-quarters of the states vote to approve, it becomes an official amendment to the Constitution.

And just for poops and giggles, it might be helpful for you to know that the Constitution has been amended 27 times, although the first ten are the Bill of Rights, and those were added all at once.

Okay, now despite all the fighting and compromise necessary to get the Constitution in its final form, they finally hammered it out and presented it to the states for ratification. And it took until 1790 for all the states to ratify. And you're never gonna guess who was the last state holding out to the last possible moment to say yes. Was it South Carolina? It wasn't South Carolina. No, it was Rhode Island. It was.

Anyway, the debate over the role of the central government, the power of state governments, and individual rights (which essentially summarize the debate of the convention) still goes on to this day. And let me just mention two areas in which we still see this debate: government surveillance and education. And what the curriculum is trying to get you to see here is that these debates weren't just confined to a moment of time when the ratification of the Constitution was at stake or the writing of the Constitution was at stake. These debates have followed us to this day.

So with respect to government surveillance, let's talk about what happened in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On that day, terrorists representing the group known as al-Qaeda crashed passenger airliners into both towers of the World Trade Center in New York, another into the Pentagon, and another crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside. Now these men had been living in the United States, learning to fly, and coordinating their plans for upwards of 18 months. And after the attacks were carried out, it was shocking to discover that these men had lived among Americans for so long. Like, how could we have missed what they were up to?

So in order to make sure that didn't happen again, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which aimed to find and stop future terrorist attacks. And hey, that's great. Well, how are they going to do that? Well, by tapping a buttload of phones and monitoring Americans' emails. But eventually a public outcry started growing regarding the PATRIOT Act and its potential to violate Fourth Amendment rights to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. So there you have the old debate about central power versus individual rights.

Now this debate also rages around the topic of education. Now historically, education falls within the domain of state authority, but in 2001 Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, which stipulated that in order to receive federal funding, schools would have to meet certain criteria. And as it turns out, those benchmarks were very much out of reach for a lot of teachers and schools, and when they didn't pass muster, the federal government imposed sanctions on those states. And here we have the same debate again. As states were slapped with federal sanctions, there was an outcry from the states that this law represented way too much federal overreach into the dominion of state power.

So at the end of the day, the debates which created our nation are the same debates we're still having today. Okay, that's what you need to know about Unit 1 Topic 5 of the AP Government curriculum.
