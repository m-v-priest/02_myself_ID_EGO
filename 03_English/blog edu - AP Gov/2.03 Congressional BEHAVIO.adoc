hey there and welcome back to heimlich's history. now we've been going through 经历 unit two of the ap government curriculum 课程, and in this video we're gonna look at what factors 因素 affect how well congress 国会 is able to get its job done. so if you're ready to get them brain gals milked, well then let's get to it. +

so in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how congressional behavior 国会行为 is influenced by election processes 选举程序, partisanship 党派之争, and divided government 分裂政府. so in the last two videos we've looked at the mechanisms 机制 congress uses to do its job, like leadership structures 领导架构 and enumerated powers 列举权力 etc, and that's how it works in a perfect world. but this is not in fact a perfect world, and so we need to look at a few factors that can either facilitate 促进 the process of law making 立法过程 or slow it down. +

the first factor affecting how well congress can do its job is ideological division 意识形态分歧. now we'll talk more about ideology 意识形态 in the next unit, but for now just understand that liberals 自由主义者 and conservatives 保守主义者 represent two different ideologies or sets of assumptions 假设 and principles 原则. and over the last 30 years we've seen a very clear trend 趋势 where republicans 共和党人 have over time become more conservative 保守的 and democrats 民主党人 have become more liberal 自由的. and that polarization 两极分化 has serious implications 影响 -- like the further from the middle each one gets, the less their ideas about what is good for the nation overlap 重叠. the result is that it becomes very difficult for them to negotiate 协商 and compromise 妥协, which is what our system of government requires. bills 法案 come up and instead of healthy debate 健康的辩论 we get policy gridlock 政策僵局 and partisan fighting 党派斗争, and that can really impede 阻碍 the process of getting laws passed. +

and so in an environment like this, the best way to get work done quickly is to have the same party as the majority 多数党 in both the house 众议院 and the senate 参议院. that way they can always pass legislation 立法 which aligns with 与……一致 their ideology without having to consider the ideological position of the minority party 少数党. for example, this is how fdr 富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福 got so many of his new deal programs 新政计划 passed in his first hundred days of office 执政的前一百天. in more recent times, this is how president obama 奥巴马总统 got his health care plan 医疗保健计划 passed over republican objections 共和党人的反对. so when one party dominates 主导 both houses of congress, things get done quick, fast, and in a hurry. +

the opposite of that reality is a divided government, in which opposing parties 对立党派 hold majorities in both houses, or when the president is from one party and congress has a majority from the opposing party. and that, as you can imagine, slows things down significantly 显著地. and let me give you an example of both realities that i just mentioned. in 2016, president obama had the chance to appoint 任命 a new supreme court justice 最高法院大法官. now 2016 happened to be the last year of his eight-year term 任期, and so obama was not up for re-election 再次竞选, and the word we use for a president in that situation is a lame-duck president 跛脚鸭总统, because since there's no chance he was going to be president again, congress didn't have much incentive 动力 to work with him on his agenda items 议程项目. anyway, supreme court justice antonin scalia died during obama's lame duck stretch 跛脚鸭时期, but hey, he's still the president and still has the constitutional responsibility 宪法责任 to appoint a new justice, and he did so, and of course he made the appointment in accordance with 依照 his own liberal ideology. the problem is that we had a divided government. the senate, whose job it is to confirm presidential appointments 确认总统任命, held a republican majority, and so senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said that it wasn't good form 不合适 to allow a president to appoint a justice in the final months of his tenure 任期 since we're about to get a new president, and so the senate refused to hold confirmation hearings 确认听证会. and that is an example of things getting bogged down 陷入困境 because of a divided government. +

but what's interesting is that four years later in 2020, it was another election year 选举年, and this time republican donald trump 唐纳德·特朗普 had the opportunity to appoint a new justice in the waning months 最后几个月 of his presidency 总统任期, and the republicans still held a majority in the senate. instead of adhering to 坚持 the principle that they laid down with obama, namely that it's not good form to appoint a new justice in an election year, they moved heaven and earth 竭尽全力 to hold confirmation hearings for a conservative justice to be put on the bench 担任法官. now whatever you think about that is irrelevant 不相关的 for our purposes -- it just matters that you can see how a government dominated by one party can speed up 加快 the work of congress. +

now another factor that affects how congress gets this work done is the way representatives 议员 understand their role 角色, and there are basically three ways that they can think about it. first, they can conform to 遵循 the delegate model of representation 代表模式. in this model, the representative believes he or she must vote with the will of the people 人民的意愿, even if it goes against the representative's own judgment 判断. the delegate 代表 believes that he or she is there to represent the people's beliefs and desires 愿望, not their own. you especially see this model in the house because every two years they have to answer to 对……负责 the people in another election. +

now representatives can also adhere to 坚持 the trustee model of representation 受托人模式. the idea here is that the representative believes he or she has been entrusted with 被赋予 the people's faith 信任 and therefore must vote according to his or her own conscience 良心. so a trustee 受托人 can actually vote against the will of the people if he or she believes it to be the right thing to do. a great example of this happened during the impeachment hearings 弹劾听证会 of donald trump. republican senator mitt romney voted for trump's removal from office 免职 even though the majority of his utah constituency 选民 did not support that vote. +

and the third model of representation is the politico model 政治家模式, which is essentially a hybrid 混合体 of the other two. the politico 政治家 will act like a delegate when it's clear that his or her constituents 选民 feel strongly about an issue, but if not, the politico will act more like a trustee. +

okay, the last topic we need to consider with respect to 关于 how efficient 高效的 congress does its work is the issue of redistricting 重新划分选区. remember that every 10 years, based on the information gathered by the census 人口普查, congressional districts 国会选区 are redrawn 重新划定 to reflect the most current population numbers, and this can be a highly contentious issue 极具争议的问题. and things can get even crazier when districts are not reapportioned 重新分配 properly, and i reckon 认为 we ought to talk about one of your supreme court cases that addresses this, namely baker versus carr in 1962 贝克诉卡尔案（1962年）. now i have a whole video on this case that goes into a lot more depth, but here it's enough to know that in tennessee 田纳西州, the work of redrawing districts had not been done properly, and that meant that rural voters 农村选民 had a lot more voting power 投票权 than urban residents 城市居民. the argument here was that such a situation violated 违反 the equal protection clause 平等保护条款 of the 14th amendment 第十四修正案, and the court agreed that it did. so out of this case you get the one-person one-vote principle 一人一票原则, meaning that redistricting had to be done in such a way that every person's vote was equally powerful. +

and then we have another required case which addressed redistricting, but before we talk about it, i need to introduce you to a term that you'll need to know, namely gerrymandering 不公正划分选区. the idea here is that districts are drawn in such a way to benefit one party or group over another 使一方受益. maybe you're confused as to what i'm talking about, so let me explain it up real nice for you. suppose 假设 you have 50 people divided into five districts, and 40 percent of republicans and 60 are democrats. if you draw the districts like this, democrats will always win these three districts and republicans will always win these two districts. but if you draw the districts like this, democrats will win in every district. either way, more districts will be voting democrat than republican. but suppose some wily 狡猾的 republican draws the districts like this, then look what happens: republicans will hold majorities in three of the districts, and now democrats only have two. so that's what we call partisan gerrymandering 党派不公正划分选区, where districts are redrawn to favor one party over another. +

but our next required case deals with racial gerrymandering 种族不公正划分选区. so in shaw versus reno 肖诉雷诺案, two north carolina districts 北卡罗来纳州选区 were drawn in very weird shapes in order to create majority black districts 黑人占多数的选区. now to be fair, north carolina was only doing what the justice department 司法部 told them to do on account of 由于 the voting rights act of 1965 1965年选举权法案. so even though these districts were drawn in order to boost the power of the black vote 增强黑人选票的影响力, the court ruled that drawing districts solely based on race 单纯基于种族划分选区 was a dangerous practice 危险做法 that could on other occasions be used to disenfranchise minority voters 剥夺少数族裔选民的选举权, and thus such a practice was deemed unconstitutional 被判定为违宪. +

so the point of everything i've just said is this: the factors that affect how well congress is able to do their job include ideological division or alignment 意识形态分歧或一致, whether representatives understand themselves as trustees, delegates, or politicos, and the process of redistricting and gerrymandering 重新划分选区和不公正划分选区. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程政府学的第二单元，在这个视频中，我们将探讨影响国会完成工作的因素。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释国会的行为是如何受到选举过程、党派之争和分裂政府的影响的。在过去的两个视频中，我们研究了国会用来开展工作的机制，比如领导结构和列举权力等等，这是在理想情况下的运作方式。但实际上这不是一个完美的世界，所以我们需要看看一些能够促进或减缓立法进程的因素。 +

影响国会工作成效的第一个因素是意识形态分歧。我们将在下一单元更多地讨论意识形态，但现在你只需明白，自由主义者和保守主义者代表了两种不同的意识形态或一系列假设和原则。在过去的30年里，我们看到一个非常明显的趋势，即共和党人变得更加保守，而民主党人变得更加自由。这种两极分化有着严重的影响——双方的观点离中间立场越远，他们对于什么对国家有利的看法重叠之处就越少。结果是，他们很难进行谈判和妥协，而这是我们的政府体系所要求的。法案提出后，我们看到的不是健康的辩论，而是政策僵局和党派斗争，这真的会阻碍法律通过的进程。 +

所以在这样的环境下，快速完成工作的最佳方式是在众议院和参议院中，多数党为同一个党派。这样一来，他们总是能够通过符合他们意识形态的立法，而不必考虑少数党的意识形态立场。例如，富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福（FDR，Franklin Delano Roosevelt）就是这样在他执政的头一百天里通过了许多新政项目。在更近的时期，巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）总统也是这样不顾共和党的反对通过了他的医疗保健计划。所以当一个党派在国会两院都占主导地位时，事情会快速得到解决。 +

与这种情况相反的是分裂政府，即对立的党派分别在两院占据多数，或者总统来自一个党派，而国会的多数来自对立的党派。可以想象，这会显著减缓事情的进展。让我给你举两个刚才提到的情况的例子。2016年，奥巴马总统有机会任命一位新的最高法院大法官。2016年恰好是他八年任期的最后一年，所以奥巴马不用再竞选连任，在这种情况下，我们称总统为“跛脚鸭总统”，因为既然他没有机会再次担任总统，国会就没有太多动力在他的议程项目上与他合作。不管怎样，最高法院大法官安东宁·斯卡利亚（Antonin Scalia）在奥巴马处于“跛脚鸭”时期去世了，但是，他仍然是总统，并且仍然有宪法赋予的任命新大法官的责任，他也确实进行了任命，当然，他是根据自己的自由主义意识形态进行任命的。问题是我们处于分裂政府状态。参议院，其职责是确认总统的任命，由共和党占多数，所以参议院多数党领袖米奇·麦康奈尔（Mitch McConnell）表示，在总统任期的最后几个月允许总统任命大法官是不合适的，因为我们即将迎来一位新总统，所以参议院拒绝举行确认听证会。这就是因为分裂政府而导致事情陷入僵局的一个例子。 +

但有趣的是，四年后的2020年，又是一个选举年，这一次，共和党人唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）有机会在他总统任期的最后几个月任命一位新大法官，并且共和党仍然在参议院占多数。他们没有坚持他们在奥巴马时期定下的原则，即选举年任命新大法官是不合适的，而是竭尽全力为一位保守派大法官举行确认听证会，让其就任。不管你对这件事有什么看法，对我们来说无关紧要——重要的是你可以看到一个由单一党派主导的政府是如何加快国会工作进程的。 +

现在，另一个影响国会完成工作的因素是众议员对自身角色的理解，基本上有三种方式。首先，他们可以遵循代表的“代表模式”（delegate model of representation）。在这种模式下，众议员认为他或她必须按照人民的意愿投票，即使这与代表自己的判断相悖。“代表”认为他或她在那里是为了代表人民的信仰和愿望，而不是代表自己的。这种模式在众议院尤为明显，因为众议员每两年都要在另一次选举中对人民负责。 +

众议员也可以坚持“受托人模式”（trustee model of representation）。这里的观点是，众议员认为他或她被赋予了人民的信任，因此必须按照自己的良心投票。所以，一个“受托人”实际上可以违背人民的意愿进行投票，如果他或她认为这样做是正确的。一个很好的例子发生在对唐纳德·特朗普的弹劾听证会上。共和党参议员米特·罗姆尼（Mitt Romney）投票支持罢免特朗普的职务，即使他在犹他州的大多数选民不支持这一投票。 +

第三种代表模式是“政治人物模式”（politico model），它本质上是另外两种模式的混合。一个“政治人物”在清楚其选民对某个问题有强烈感受时，会表现得像一个“代表”，但如果不是这种情况，“政治人物”会更像一个“受托人”。 +

好的，关于国会工作效率，我们需要考虑的最后一个话题是选区重划（redistricting）问题。记住，每10年，根据人口普查收集的信息，国会选区会被重新划分以反映最新的人口数据，这可能是一个极具争议的问题。当选区没有得到恰当的重新分配时，事情会变得更加疯狂，我认为我们应该谈谈一个与此相关的最高法院案例，即1962年的“贝克诉卡尔案”（Baker versus Carr）。我有一个关于这个案例的完整视频，讲解得更深入，但在这里，你只需知道在田纳西州，选区重划工作没有做好，这意味着农村选民的投票权比城市居民大得多。争议点在于这种情况违反了美国宪法第十四修正案的平等保护条款，最高法院也认同这一点。所以从这个案例中产生了“一人一票”原则，这意味着选区重划必须以这样一种方式进行，即每个人的选票具有同等效力。 +

然后我们还有另一个与选区重划相关的必修案例。但在我们讨论这个案例之前，我需要向你介绍一个你需要知道的术语，即“杰利蝾螈”（gerrymandering）。这里的意思是，选区的划分方式会使一个党派或群体比另一个党派或群体受益。也许你对我所说的感到困惑，让我给你好好解释一下。假设你有50个人被划分到五个选区，其中40%是共和党人，60%是民主党人。如果你这样划分选区，民主党人将总是赢得其中三个选区，而共和党人将总是赢得另外两个选区。但如果你这样划分选区，民主党人将赢得所有选区。不管怎样，民主党人占多数的选区会比共和党人多。但是假设一个狡猾的共和党人这样划分选区，那么看看会发生什么：共和党人将在三个选区中占多数，而民主党人只有两个选区。这就是我们所说的党派性选区划分（partisan gerrymandering），即选区重划会偏袒一个党派而不是另一个党派。 +

但我们下一个必修案例涉及到种族性选区划分（racial gerrymandering）。在“肖诉雷诺案”（Shaw versus Reno）中，北卡罗来纳州的两个选区被划分成非常奇怪的形状，目的是创建黑人占多数的选区。公平地说，北卡罗来纳州只是按照司法部根据1965年《选举权法案》的要求去做。所以，即使这些选区的划分是为了增强黑人选票的力量，最高法院还是裁定，仅仅基于种族来划分选区是一种危险的做法，在其他情况下可能会剥夺少数族裔选民的选举权，因此这种做法被认定为违宪。 +

所以我刚才所说的重点是：影响国会工作成效的因素包括意识形态的分歧或一致，众议员把自己看作是“受托人”、“代表”还是“政治人物”，以及选区重划和“杰利蝾螈”（选区划分不公）的过程。 +
