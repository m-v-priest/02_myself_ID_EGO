Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History, and furthermore welcome to another video on your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程. In this video, we're going to be considering everything you need to know about the landmark case 里程碑式案件 Engel v. Vitale 恩格尔诉维塔尔案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked separation of church and state 政教分离 style, well then let's get to it. +  

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. This case came before the court in 1962, and before that time, the New York Board of Regents 纽约州教育委员会 had composed 撰写 a non-denominational prayer 无教派倾向的祷告 to be recited 背诵 by school children after saying the Pledge of Allegiance 效忠宣誓. And the prayer -- just 22 words in length -- went something like this: "Almighty God 全能的上帝, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee 我们承认依赖于你, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our country." Now as far as prayers go, that one's pretty vague 笼统的 -- like ain't nobody invoking 援引 Jesus or Allah in that prayer. And what's more, children could opt out of 选择不参加 that prayer with written permission from their parents. +  

Even so, a group of parents led by Stephen Engel challenged 质疑 the practice. And why did they do that? Well, for that, let's consider the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中. For Engel and his crew, this prayer was a violation 违反 of the First Amendment's 第一修正案 Establishment Clause 确立条款, which in case you forgot says that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion 确立宗教". Now if you're paying attention -- and I know that you are -- you might be saying, "Wait what? Congress isn't even involved here -- this is a New York state law. So how could Engel claim that this law was violating his First Amendment rights which protects citizens from the federal government 联邦政府?" +  

Now that's your question, then let me hasten to remind you of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案, which says, "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge 剥夺 the privileges or immunities 特权或豁免权 of the citizens of the United States." So the 14th Amendment essentially 实质上 applies the First Amendment to the states as well as to the federal government. But don't get confused by all the amendments -- at the end of the day, this is a case about the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. +  

Okay, so what was the decision? Well, the question the court considered was this: does the reading of a state-sponsored prayer 州政府支持的祷告 at the beginning of school violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment? And their answer -- in a 6-1 decision -- was yes, the prayer did in fact violate the First Amendment. It was Justice Hugo Black who wrote the majority opinion 多数意见, and in it he said, "The First Amendment was added to the constitution to stand as a guarantee 保证 that neither the power nor the prestige 威望 of the federal government would be used to control, support, or influence the kinds of prayer the American people can say." +  

Now Justice Potter Stewart was the one justice who dissented 持异议, and his reasoning 理由 was that the practice of school prayer was constitutional 合宪的 because it gave children "the opportunity of sharing in the spiritual heritage 精神遗产 of our nation." Additionally 此外, Stewart argued that the government isn't establishing a religion just by offering a prayer for those who want to pray. However, it was Thomas Jefferson's famous "wall of separation between church and state 政教分离之墙" that won the day in this case. +  

All right, now let's talk about why this case matters. First of all, the Engel decision was a demonstration 证明 of how the court ruled in favor of 支持 individual liberties 个人自由. Remember, in First Amendment cases, the court is always trying to strike a balance 达成平衡 between social order 社会秩序 and individual liberty, and in this case they went with the latter 后者. Second, this case matters because it established the groundwork 基础 for many subsequent 后续的 cases regarding schools and religious activities. For example, Engel was cited 引用 in the Wallace v. Jaffree case in 1985, which struck down 废除 an Alabama law that provided for a minute of silence 静默一分钟 at the beginning of the school day. And in 1992, it was also the basis for declaring clergy-led prayer 神职人员带领的祷告 at a middle school graduation ceremony 毕业典礼 unconstitutional. And there are several other cases I could mention, but the point is Engel v. Vitale was a very important case that had implications 影响 for the relationship between government and religion for decades to come. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道，同时也欢迎来到关于美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程必修最高法院案例的另一期视频。在这个视频中，我们将探讨你需要了解的具有里程碑意义的“恩格尔诉维塔尔案（Engel v. Vitale）”的所有内容。所以，如果你准备好以“政教分离”的方式激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

一如既往，我们先从案件事实讲起。这个案件于1962年提交到最高法院，在此之前，纽约州教育委员会（New York Board of Regents）编写了一篇无教派的祈祷文，要求学生在宣读效忠誓言（Pledge of Allegiance）后背诵。这篇祈祷文只有22个单词，内容大致是：“全能的上帝，我们承认我们依赖于你，我们祈求你赐福于我们、我们的父母、我们的老师和我们的国家。” 就祈祷文而言，这篇相当笼统——里面没有任何人援引耶稣或真主。此外，学生可以在获得父母书面许可的情况下选择不参加祈祷。 +  

即便如此，由斯蒂芬·恩格尔（Stephen Engel）领导的一群家长对这一做法提出了质疑。他们为什么这么做呢？为了弄清楚，我们需要考虑所涉及的宪法原则。对恩格尔及其支持者来说，这一祈祷文违反了宪法第一修正案（First Amendment）的“确立宗教条款（Establishment Clause）”，如果你忘了，该条款规定“国会不得制定关于确立宗教的法律”。如果你在仔细听——我知道你在听——你可能会问：“等等，这跟国会有什么关系？这是纽约州的法律。恩格尔怎么能声称这项法律侵犯了他受第一修正案保护、免受联邦政府干预的权利呢？” +  

既然你有这个疑问，那我要赶紧提醒你宪法第十四修正案（14th Amendment）的存在，该修正案规定：“任何州不得制定或执行任何剥夺美国公民的特权或豁免权的法律。” 因此，第十四修正案实质上使第一修正案既适用于各州，也适用于联邦政府。但不要被所有这些修正案搞糊涂了——归根结底，这是一个关于第一修正案“确立宗教条款”的案件。 +  

那么，判决结果如何呢？最高法院考虑的问题是：在学校开始时宣读州政府支持的祈祷文是否违反第一修正案的“确立宗教条款”？最高法院以6比1的裁决回答“是的”，该祈祷文确实违反了第一修正案。雨果·布莱克（Hugo Black）大法官撰写了多数意见，他在意见中指出：“第一修正案被纳入宪法，旨在确保联邦政府的权力和威望不会被用来控制、支持或影响美国人民可以进行的祈祷类型。” +  

波特·斯图尔特（Potter Stewart）大法官是唯一持异议的人，他的理由是学校祈祷的做法符合宪法，因为它给予孩子们“分享我们国家精神遗产的机会”。此外，斯图尔特认为，政府仅仅为那些想祈祷的人提供祈祷机会，并不属于“确立宗教”。然而，托马斯·杰斐逊（Thomas Jefferson）提出的著名的“政教分离之墙”观点在本案中占了上风。 +  

现在我们来谈谈这个案件为何重要。首先，“恩格尔案”的判决展示了最高法院如何做出有利于个人自由的裁决。记住，在涉及第一修正案的案件中，最高法院总是试图在社会秩序和个人自由之间取得平衡，而在本案中，他们选择了后者。其次，这个案件之所以重要，是因为它为后来许多关于学校和宗教活动的案件奠定了基础。例如，1985年的“华莱士诉贾弗里案（Wallace v. Jaffree）”援引了“恩格尔案”，该案废除了阿拉巴马州一项规定学校每天开始时静默一分钟的法律。1992年，“恩格尔案”还成为宣布中学毕业典礼上由神职人员带领的祈祷违宪的依据。我还可以提到其他几个案件，但关键是“恩格尔诉维塔尔案”是一个非常重要的案件，对未来几十年政府与宗教的关系产生了深远影响。 +

Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History, and furthermore welcome to another video on your required Supreme Court cases for the AP Government curriculum. In this video, we're going to be considering everything you need to know about the landmark case Engel v. Vitale. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked separation of church and state style, well then let's get to it.

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. This case came before the court in 1962, and before that time, the New York Board of Regents had composed a non-denominational prayer to be recited by school children after saying the Pledge of Allegiance.

And what's more, children could opt out of that prayer with written permission from their parents.

Even so, a group of parents led by Stephen Engel challenged the practice. And why did they do that? Well, for that, let's consider the constitutional principle at stake. For Engel and his crew, this prayer was a violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which in case you forgot says that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." Now if you're paying attention -- and I know that you are -- you might be saying, "Wait what? Congress isn't even involved here -- this is a New York state law. So how could Engel claim that this law was violating his First Amendment rights which protects citizens from the federal government?"
