Hey there, and welcome back to Homeless History. Now we've been going through Unit Five of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and that means it's time to talk about the role of the media as a linkage institution 连接机构. So if you're ready to get them brain callus military, then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain the media's role as a linkage institution. Now remember what a linkage institution is -- it's a societal structure 社会结构 that connects people to their government or the political process 政治进程. And already in this unit, we've already talked about three other linkage institutions: political parties 政党, interest groups 利益集团, elections 选举, and now we add the fourth -- the media 媒体. +

Now how are the media a linkage institution? Whether it's through traditional media 传统媒体 like newspapers or television or new outlets 新闻渠道 like social media 社交媒体, the media's reporting of what our government does influences the way citizens engage in politics 公民参与政治的方式. Ultimately, this is why it was such a big deal 重要的事 to have the protection of the free press 新闻自由 included in the Bill of Rights 权利法案. It's the media which acts as a watchdog agency 监督机构 that holds the government responsible to the people 让政府对人民负责. Like if the media don't tell us what our representatives are doing, then who else will? +

Now won't surprise you to hear that the form that our news has taken has changed significantly over time. We've had newspapers since the beginning of the republic 共和国初期. In fact, the print culture 印刷文化 that existed in colonial America and later in the United States was second to none 首屈一指. Newspapers came off printing presses 印刷机 by the metric butt load （俚语，大量地）, and by 1792, the delivery of newspapers was subsidized 补贴 by the government. +

The next big innovation 创新 in news delivery 新闻传播 was the telegraph 电报 in the mid-19th century, and that meant that news from all over could be delivered almost instantaneously 瞬间地 via electric wire 电线. And then came the radio 收音机 in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This became the first truly mass media 大众媒体 since centralized stations 中央电台 could broadcast political debates 政治辩论 and lots of other programming 节目 into people's homes. It was President Franklin Roosevelt who was the first president to exploit this medium 媒介 to its full political potential 充分政治潜力. In the midst of the Great Depression 大萧条时期, he held what he called fireside chats 炉边谈话 in which he would explain his administration's policies 政府政策 in bite-sized chunks 易于理解的小块内容 so that the average American could understand them. +

Then in the 1950s and 60s, radio gave way to 让位于 television 电视. All of a sudden, Americans had trusted news personalities 新闻名人 who came into the TV every night to tell them the daily news. And television actually played a huge role in the public's understanding in response to the Vietnam War 越南战争. While Presidents Johnson and Nixon were telling the public how great it was going in Vietnam, television news reporters were on the ground over there showing the carnage 屠杀 and telling a much different story. So in this way, television news created a profound gap 巨大差距 in the American public's trust in the government 美国公众对政府的信任. +

Then in the late 90s came the internet 互联网 and its child in the 2000s -- social media 社交媒体. Arguably 可以说, this new innovation has changed the way Americans consume news 消费新闻 more than anything else that came before it. Now it's true that traditional news outlets 新闻机构 have used this advancement 进步 to their benefit by establishing significant presences 建立重要影响力 on sites like Facebook and Twitter. However, the manner in which people expose themselves to the news 接触新闻的方式 has changed profoundly 深刻地. +

According to a report by the Pew Trust in 2010, news consumption 新闻消费 has become a socially engaging and socially driven activity 社交互动和社交驱动的活动, especially online. The public is clearly part of the news process now. Participation comes more through sharing than contributing news themselves. Furthermore, in the same report, the authors argue that news consumption has become a manifestation 表现 of what they call the daily me 日常自我. In other words, it is the individual news consumer 个人新闻消费者 which decides what news to consume and what news to ignore. Powered by robust algorithms 强大的算法, news aggregators 新闻聚合器 on our phones and our social media now show us the news that we will like and that will keep us on their platform -- not necessarily the news that we need to know, and certainly not the news that will challenge us. +

Regardless of the changes in format 形式, the news media 新闻媒体 has always presented the American public with at least three major avenues 途径 of reporting. First are news events 新闻事件, which are you know -- anything newsworthy 有新闻价值的. The Hindenburg exploded. Mount St. Helens erupted. COVID-19 has become a global pandemic 全球大流行病. Second is investigative journalism 调查性新闻, which is more long-form news 长篇新闻 which seeks to expose corruption 揭露腐败 in the government and society. +

Now the heyday 全盛时期 of investigative journalism was in the first part of the 20th century during the Progressive Era 进步时代. You had journalists like Ida Tarbell and Jacob Riis and Lincoln Steffens who wrote long exposes 长篇揭露文章 on American corruption in the oil industry or urban poverty 城市贫困 and a whole host of other issues. And the American people loved these journalists with their attention to detail 注重细节 and their powerful arguments 有力论据. But politicians... er... not so much. In fact, it was President Teddy Roosevelt who coined the term 创造术语 for these journalists -- namely muckrakers 黑幕揭发者. They're just down there in the muck of society 社会的泥潭, raking it all around and then showing the dirt to everyone. +

Even so, muckraker journalism led people to put pressure on the representatives 代表 to pass certain laws. For example, one of the more famous muckrakers, Upton Sinclair, published a book called The Jungle which provided an in-depth investigation 深入调查 on the profoundly unsanitary conditions 极其不卫生的条件 in the meatpacking plants 肉类加工厂. And I'm not exaggerating when I say profoundly unsanitary. Like he witnessed rats being ground up 磨碎 into people's meat, and on occasion a human thumb 人的拇指. But don't worry -- once the meat was all ground up, roof leaks in the plant ensure that the vats of meat were soaked with polluted rainwater 被污染的雨水浸泡. So you know, it's okay. +

Anyway, the point is upon the publication of this expose 揭露文章, Americans were horrified 震惊 that the meat that they were eating was actually rats and thumbs, and so they pressured Congress to pass legislation addressing it -- namely the Pure Food and Drug Act 纯净食品和药品法案 and the Meat Inspection Act 肉类检验法案. +

The third avenue of news reporting is election coverage 选举报道 and political commentary 政治评论. This is a good thing because we need to know who is running for office 竞选公职 and we need help interpreting their policies 解读政策. However, this can also lead to a well-documented problem 有充分记录的问题, namely horse race journalism 竞选形势新闻报道. During election seasons, news outlets can get real thirsty for polling numbers 民调数据 and publish them ad nauseum 令人作呕地频繁发布. I've talked about this in previous videos, but with the fluctuating polling numbers 波动的民调数据 always in front of our eyes, elections can turn more into a popularity contest 人气竞赛 than an exercising critical thinking about the qualities of a candidate in their platform 对候选人政纲进行批判性思考. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Homeless 应为 Heimler）的历史频道。目前我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第五单元，这意味着我们要谈谈媒体作为一种联动机构所扮演的角色。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那么我们就开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释媒体作为联动机构的作用。还记得什么是联动机构吗？它是一种社会结构，将民众与他们的政府或政治进程联系起来。在这个单元里，我们已经谈到了其他三种联动机构：政党、利益集团、选举，现在我们要加上第四种——媒体。 +

那么媒体是如何成为一种联动机构的呢？无论是通过像报纸、电视这样的传统媒体，还是像社交媒体这样的新平台，媒体对政府行为的报道会影响公民参与政治的方式。最终，这就是为什么把新闻自由的保护纳入《权利法案》是一件非常重要的事情。媒体就像一个监督机构，让政府对民众负责。比如，如果媒体不告诉我们我们的代表在做什么，那么还有谁会告诉我们呢？ +

听到新闻的形式随着时间发生了重大变化，你应该不会感到惊讶。从共和国成立之初我们就有了报纸。事实上，殖民时期的美国以及后来美国的印刷文化是首屈一指的。大量的报纸从印刷机上产出，到1792年，政府还对报纸的配送进行补贴。 +

新闻传播的下一个重大创新是19世纪中期的电报，这意味着来自各地的新闻几乎可以通过电线即时传递。然后在19世纪末20世纪初，收音机出现了。它成为了第一种真正的大众媒体，因为中央电台可以把政治辩论和许多其他节目广播到人们的家中。富兰克林·罗斯福（Franklin Roosevelt）总统是第一个充分利用这种媒体发挥其政治潜力的总统。在大萧条期间，他举办了所谓的 “炉边谈话”，在谈话中，他会把政府的政策以通俗易懂的方式解释给普通美国人听。 +

然后在20世纪50年代和60年代，收音机被电视所取代。突然之间，美国人有了值得信赖的新闻人物，他们每晚都会出现在电视上告诉大家每日新闻。而且电视在公众对越南战争的理解方面发挥了巨大作用。当约翰逊（Johnson）总统和尼克松（Nixon）总统告诉公众在越南的情况进展顺利时，电视新闻记者却在现场展示战争的残酷，讲述着截然不同的故事。所以从这个角度看，电视新闻在公众对政府的信任方面造成了巨大的差距。 +

然后在20世纪90年代末，互联网出现了，在2000年代又有了它的产物——社交媒体。可以说，这项新创新比之前的任何事物都更能改变美国人获取新闻的方式。诚然，传统新闻媒体利用这一进步，在脸书（Facebook）和推特（Twitter）等网站上建立了重要的影响力。然而，人们接触新闻的方式已经发生了深刻的变化。 +

根据皮尤研究中心（Pew Trust）在2010年的一份报告，新闻消费已经成为一种具有社交参与性和社交驱动性的活动，尤其是在网上。现在公众显然已经成为新闻传播过程的一部分。参与更多地体现在分享新闻上，而不是自己贡献新闻。此外，在同一份报告中，作者认为新闻消费已经成为他们所谓的 “每日自我” 的一种体现。换句话说，是个人新闻消费者决定了消费什么新闻以及忽略什么新闻。在强大算法的推动下，我们手机和社交媒体上的新闻聚合器现在向我们展示我们喜欢的新闻，让我们停留在他们的平台上——展示的不一定是我们需要知道的新闻，当然也不一定是能让我们受到挑战的新闻。 +

不管形式如何变化，新闻媒体一直为美国公众提供至少三种主要的报道途径。第一种是新闻事件，也就是任何有新闻价值的事情。比如 “兴登堡号”（Hindenburg）爆炸。圣海伦斯火山（Mount St. Helens）喷发。新冠疫情（COVID-19）成为全球大流行病。第二种是调查性新闻，这是一种更长篇的新闻形式，旨在揭露政府和社会中的腐败现象。 +

调查性新闻的全盛时期是在20世纪初的进步时代。像艾达·塔贝尔（Ida Tarbell）、雅各布·里斯（Jacob Riis）和林肯·斯蒂芬斯（Lincoln Steffens）这样的记者写了长篇报道，揭露美国石油行业的腐败、城市贫困以及一系列其他问题。美国民众喜欢这些记者对细节的关注和有力的论证。但政治家们……呃……就不太喜欢了。事实上，是西奥多·罗斯福（Teddy Roosevelt）总统为这些记者创造了一个词——“扒粪者”（muckrakers）。他们就处在社会的泥潭中，把脏东西翻出来给所有人看。 +

即便如此，“扒粪者” 式的新闻报道促使人们向代表们施压，要求通过某些法律。例如，一位非常著名的 “扒粪者” 厄普顿·辛克莱（Upton Sinclair）出版了一本名为《屠场》（The Jungle）的书，对肉类加工厂极其不卫生的状况进行了深入调查。我这么说可没有夸张，他目睹了老鼠被绞碎后混入人们的肉中，甚至有时还有人的拇指。不过别担心——一旦肉被绞碎，工厂的屋顶漏水会确保肉桶里浸满受污染的雨水。所以你懂的，情况就是这样。 +

不管怎样，这份调查报告一经发表，美国人震惊地发现他们吃的肉里竟然有老鼠和拇指，于是他们向国会施压，要求通过相关立法——也就是《纯净食品和药品法案》（Pure Food and Drug Act）和《肉类检验法案》（Meat Inspection Act）。 +

新闻报道的第三种途径是选举报道和政治评论。这是一件好事，因为我们需要知道谁在竞选公职，并且需要有人帮助我们理解他们的政策。然而，这也会导致一个有记录的问题，也就是 “赛马式新闻”（horse race journalism）。在选举季，新闻媒体对民意调查数据非常渴望，并会不厌其烦地公布这些数据。我在之前的视频中谈到过这个问题，但是不断波动的民意调查数据总是出现在我们眼前，这使得选举更多地变成了一场人气竞赛，而不是对候选人纲领中候选人素质的批判性思考。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取我的复习资料包，这将帮助你在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你想向我传达让我继续制作这类视频的信号，那么一定要点击订阅按钮，我会照办的。海姆勒，退出。 +
