Hey there and welcome back to Heimlich's History. Now we've been going through unit two of the AP government curriculum 课程, and in this video we need to keep talking about the judicial branch 司法部门 of the federal government 联邦政府, namely 即；也就是 how the court works and the debate over its legitimacy 合法性. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then let's get to it. +

So here's what we're trying to do in this video: explain how the exercise 行使 of judicial review 司法审查 in conjunction with 与…一起 life tenure 终身任期 can lead to debate about the legitimacy of the supreme court's 最高法院的 power. Now why would anybody debate the legitimacy of the supreme court's power? Well you might remember during the ratification 批准 debates, anti-federalists 反联邦党人 were all kinds of twitchy 紧张不安的 about the lifetime appointments of federal judges 联邦法官. +

Now I talked about this at length 详细地 in the last video, so let me just remind you here that federal judges are not elected 选举, but rather they are appointed 任命 by the president for life on the condition of good behavior 行为良好. Now the anti-federalists thought this arrangement 安排 was about as pleasant as smelling an old monkey's armpit, because they believed that if the judges were insulated from 与…隔绝 the people, then they would be sorely 非常地 tempted 诱惑 to slide into tyranny 暴政. +

But wait, says the observant 善于观察的 student, how could the supreme court become tyrannical 专制的? They have no power to make law -- like that's congress 国会 -- and they have no power to execute the law 执行法律 -- that's the president. Excellent observation 观察 my dear pupil, but the court does have the ability to establish national policy 制定国家政策 through its power of judicial review. Recall 回想 that this is the power the court has to rule on 对…作出裁决 the constitutionality 合宪性 of laws, and if the court decides a law is unconstitutional 违宪的, it becomes null and void 无效的. +

Now the anti-federalists had a point here, but remember that Alexander Hamilton argued in Federalist 78 that all those arguments actually protected the liberty 自由 of the people as opposed to 而不是 squashing 压制 it. Now I won't go into that here, but you can watch the video that I made on that document if you want to know more. +

Okay, so when we're talking about why people debate the legitimacy of the court, you need to understand the role of precedence 先例 in the court's decision-making process 决策过程. So whenever the court rules on 对…作出裁决 a case 案件, that creates a precedent, which just means that the decision will act like a template 模板 for future decisions. So for example, Brown vs the Board of Education 布朗诉教育委员会案 in 1954 established the precedent that racial segregation 种族隔离 in schools was unconstitutional. So now if there's a similar case with similar facts that comes before the court, they probably won't even hear the case because why? Precedent. You want to segregate 隔离 your schools? Sorry, unconstitutional -- we've already decided that. +

It is a precedent now. The principle 原则 that governs 支配 this emphasis on 对…的强调 precedent is called stare decisis 遵循先例原则, which is a Latin term 术语 that just means "let the decision stand." So the court always considers past precedents, which are bound by 受…约束 the principle of stare decisis, when making their ruling 裁决. However, that doesn't mean that precedents cannot be overturned 推翻. They very much can, but it's usually a pretty monumental 重大的 deal. Brown versus the Board of Education was itself an overturning of the precedent established in Plessy versus Ferguson 普莱西诉弗格森案, which upheld 支持 racial segregation. +

Okay, wait a second Heimler, you've been talking about that precedent is so important to how the supreme court rules, but now you're telling us that precedence can be overturned? Well you bet your sweet bippy I am. So that means we need to understand what factors 因素 determine 决定 if a precedent will stand or be overturned. Actually there's a lot of factors, like whether the justices 法官 in question 考虑中的 consider the constitution a living, evolving 发展的 document or whether they interpret 解释 it as the words are literally 逐字地 written. But probably the most significant 重要的 factor is the ideological makeup 意识形态构成 of the court, which is to say whether the majority of justices are liberal 自由派的 or conservative 保守派的. +

Now remember that it's the president that appoints justices to the supreme court with the advice and consent （美）咨询和同意权 of the senate 参议院, and appointing these justices is one of the most important things the president does. Now as I've said before, the president is going to appoint justices that align with 与…一致 the president's political ideology 政治意识形态 -- so conservative presidents appoint conservative judges and liberal presidents appoint liberal judges. You know there are a few exceptions 例外 to that rule in lower courts, but on the supreme court that's basically how it works. +

So for example, the Burger Court 伯格法院, which was named after Chief Justice Warren Burger and not the court's favorite fast food takeout item, was a pretty liberal court -- though probably not as liberal as the Warren Court 沃伦法院 which preceded 先于 it. And during the tenure 任期 of the Burger Court, the Roe v Wade 罗诉韦德案 decision was handed down 宣布, which repealed 废除 state laws prohibiting abortion 禁止堕胎 in the first trimester 三个月 of pregnancy 怀孕. Additionally 此外, the Burger Court ruled against 作出对…不利的裁决 President Richard Nixon in United States v Nixon 美国诉尼克松案, when the president invoked 援引 executive privilege 行政特权 and refused to turn over 移交 evidence that might have implicated 牵连 him in the Watergate scandal 水门事件. The Burger Court was like "no" -- they ruled that while the president did have executive privilege, it did not extend 延伸 as far as he wanted to. So in both of these decisions -- the first expanding access to abortion 扩大堕胎权利 and the second limiting executive privilege -- both of these align with liberal ideology. +

But after the Burger Court we have the Rehnquist Court 伦奎斯特法院, which was decidedly 明确地 more conservative. Under Rehnquist, the court ruled on Planned Parenthood v Casey 计划生育联盟诉凯西案, which restricted abortion rights instead of unfettered access to abortion 不受限制的堕胎权利. Now the court upheld certain restrictions like a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent 父母同意 for minors 未成年人 seeking abortion. Also under the Rehnquist Court we had District of Columbia v Heller 哥伦比亚特区诉海勒案, in which the court expanded access to gun ownership 扩大持枪权利. So both of these cases are examples of decisions that align with conservative ideology. +

So when the court hands down 宣布 a controversial 有争议的 decision, future presidents will seek to appoint justices who might overturn those precedents. For example, as I record this, many conservatives have put their hope in the Roberts Court 罗伯茨法院, which is a conservative court, to overturn Roe v Wade. It looks like they are going to be ruling on a couple significant abortion-related cases in the coming years, so we'll just have to wait and see what they do. +

So you can see why the anti-federalists were very concerned about the power of the supreme court. Like it's true that it has no constitutional power 宪法权力 to create legislation 制定法律 or to enforce it 执行法律, but by its power of judicial review and the ideological makeup of its justices, the decisions handed down can have far-reaching effects 深远影响. And when those effects are experienced by the population, it leads some of them to question the legitimacy of the court. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第二单元，在这个视频中，我们需要继续讨论联邦政府的司法部门，也就是法院是如何运作的，以及围绕其合法性的争论。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释司法审查的行使，结合终身任期制，是如何引发关于最高法院权力合法性的争论的。那么，为什么会有人争论最高法院权力的合法性呢？嗯，你可能还记得在批准宪法的辩论中，反联邦党人对联邦法官的终身任命感到非常不安。 +

我在上一个视频中详细讨论过这个问题，所以我在这里提醒一下，联邦法官不是选举产生的，而是由总统任命，只要品行良好就可以终身任职。反联邦党人认为这种安排就像闻老猴子的腋窝一样令人不悦，因为他们认为如果法官不受民众约束，那么他们就极有可能走向专制。 +

但是等等，细心的学生可能会问，最高法院怎么会变得专制呢？他们没有立法权——立法权在国会——而且他们也没有执法权——执法权在总统手中。观察得很到位，亲爱的学生，但法院确实有通过司法审查权来制定国家政策的能力。回想一下，司法审查权是指法院有权对法律的合宪性做出裁决，如果法院判定一项法律违宪，那么这项法律就会无效。 +

反联邦党人的观点有一定道理，但要记住，亚历山大·汉密尔顿在《联邦党人文集》第78篇中认为，所有这些关于法官终身任职的安排实际上是保护人民的自由，而不是压制自由。我在这里就不深入讨论了，如果你想了解更多，可以观看我关于这篇文献的视频。 +

好的，所以当我们讨论为什么人们会争论法院的合法性时，你需要理解先例在法院决策过程中的作用。每当法院对一个案件做出裁决时，就会创造一个先例，这意味着这个裁决将作为未来裁决的模板。例如，1954年的 “布朗诉教育委员会案”（Brown vs the Board of Education）确立了学校种族隔离制度违宪的先例。所以现在如果有一个事实类似的案件提交到法院，他们很可能甚至不会审理这个案件，为什么呢？因为先例。你想在学校实行种族隔离？抱歉，这是违宪的——我们已经做出过这样的裁决了。 +

这就是一个先例。指导这种对先例重视的原则被称为 “遵循先例”（stare decisis），这是一个拉丁术语，意思是 “让裁决保持有效”。所以法院在做出裁决时，总是会考虑过去的先例，并且受遵循先例原则的约束。然而，这并不意味着先例不能被推翻。先例是可以被推翻的，但通常这是一件非常重大的事情。“布朗诉教育委员会案” 本身就推翻了 “普莱西诉弗格森案”（Plessy versus Ferguson）中确立的支持种族隔离的先例。 +

好的，等一下，海姆勒，你一直在说先例对最高法院的裁决非常重要，但现在你又告诉我们先例是可以被推翻的？没错。所以这意味着我们需要理解是什么因素决定一个先例是维持还是被推翻。实际上有很多因素，比如相关的大法官是把宪法看作一部有生命力、不断演变的文件，还是按照字面意思来解释宪法。但可能最重要的因素是法院的意识形态构成，也就是说，大多数大法官是自由派还是保守派。 +

要记住，总统在参议院的建议和同意下任命最高法院大法官，而任命这些大法官是总统做的最重要的事情之一。就像我之前说的，总统会任命与自己政治意识形态一致的大法官——所以保守派总统会任命保守派法官，自由派总统会任命自由派法官。要知道，在下级法院有一些例外情况，但在最高法院基本上就是这样运作的。 +

例如，以首席大法官沃伦·伯格（Warren Burger）命名的 “伯格法院”（Burger Court），可不是因为它是法院最喜欢的快餐外卖哦，这是一个相当自由派的法院——不过可能没有在它之前的 “沃伦法院”（Warren Court）那么自由派。在伯格法院任期内，做出了 “罗伊诉韦德案”（Roe v Wade）的裁决，该裁决废除了禁止在怀孕头三个月堕胎的州法律。此外，在 “美国诉尼克松案”（United States v Nixon）中，伯格法院对理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）总统做出了不利裁决，当时总统援引行政特权，拒绝交出可能使他牵涉到水门事件丑闻的证据。伯格法院表示 “不行”——他们裁定，虽然总统确实有行政特权，但这种特权并没有他想要的那么广泛。所以在这两个裁决中——第一个扩大了堕胎的可及性，第二个限制了行政特权——都符合自由派的意识形态。 +

但是在伯格法院之后，我们有了 “伦奎斯特法院”（Rehnquist Court），这个法院明显更加保守。在伦奎斯特（Rehnquist）的领导下，法院对 “计划生育协会诉凯西案”（Planned Parenthood v Casey）做出了裁决，该裁决限制了堕胎权利，而不是给予堕胎不受限制的权利。法院维持了某些限制，比如24小时等待期，以及未成年人堕胎需要父母同意。同样在伦奎斯特法院任期内，有 “哥伦比亚特区诉海勒案”（District of Columbia v Heller），在这个案件中，法院扩大了拥有枪支的权利。所以这两个案件都是符合保守派意识形态的裁决的例子。 +

所以当法院做出有争议的裁决时，未来的总统会试图任命可能推翻这些先例的大法官。例如，在我录制这个视频的时候，许多保守派把希望寄托在 “罗伯茨法院”（Roberts Court）身上，这是一个保守派的法院，他们希望这个法院推翻 “罗伊诉韦德案” 的裁决。看起来在未来几年里，他们将对一些与堕胎相关的重大案件做出裁决，所以我们只能拭目以待他们会怎么做。 +

所以你可以明白为什么反联邦党人非常关注最高法院的权力。确实，最高法院没有宪法赋予的立法权或执法权，但通过其司法审查权以及大法官的意识形态构成，做出的裁决可能会产生深远的影响。当民众感受到这些影响时，就会有一些人质疑法院的合法性。 +
