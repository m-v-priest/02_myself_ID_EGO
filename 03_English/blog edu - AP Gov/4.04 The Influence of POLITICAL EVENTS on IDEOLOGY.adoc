Well, hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 4 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video we're going to talk about how important events can change or at least affect your political beliefs 政治信仰. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how cultural factors 文化因素 influence political attitudes 政治态度 and socialization 社会化. So in the last couple of videos, we've been talking about a phenomenon 现象 called political socialization 政治社会化, which is the process by which we come to hold our political beliefs. And there are a lot of factors that go into 促成；参与 how we form those beliefs -- from our family of origin 原生家庭 to what we're taught in school to what generation we belong -- and now we just need to add one more factor to the pot of political socialization. And once we do, then baby, we got a stew going. +

So the factor I'm talking about is what the AP overlords 美国大学预修课程主导者 call political events 政治事件, and basically what they mean by that is any event that is deemed 认为；视为 significant 重要的 in the life of our nation. And depending on how significant that event is, it can have a disproportionate effect 不成比例的影响 on our political beliefs. So let me give you some examples. And again, everything I'm saying here is a generalization 概括；归纳 -- there are of course exceptions 例外情况. +

So the Silent Generation 沉默的一代, who if you remember were born roughly in the 1920s up through 1945, spent their formative years 成长时期 struggling through the Great Depression 大萧条. Job loss 失业 was rampant 猖獗的；泛滥的, and poverty 贫困 became more and more common. In 1932, their parents elected Franklin D. Roosevelt as president, and Roosevelt expanded the federal government 联邦政府 in ways that would make George Washington poop his pantaloons 大吃一惊. But he did this to alleviate 减轻 the suffering of Americans, and his New Deal program 新政计划 created jobs for people out of work 失业者 and created an economic safety net 经济安全网 in the form of Social Security 社会保障. +

Now whether you agree with those policies 政策 or not is not the point. The point is the Silent Generation grew up in the midst of 在…之中 unimaginable hardship 难以想象的艰难困苦, and they witnessed 见证 the growth of the federal government in order to step in 介入 and help. So that major event combined with the government's performance in World War II led this generation to trust the government to intervene 干预 for their safety and well-being 安全与福祉, and that in turn 反过来 influenced how they voted. +

Now the Baby Boomers 婴儿潮一代 lived through the Vietnam War 越南战争, and that trust in government was squarely 直接地 flushed down the toilet 付之东流 after the release of the Pentagon Papers 五角大楼文件, which we talked about in Unit 3. It was made clear that the government had been lying about the nature and progress of the war. In fact, they also witnessed Richard Nixon resign his presidency 辞去总统职务 because he was involved in a plot 阴谋 -- an illegal plot -- to get reelected 连任. So by the election of 1980, Boomers responded to these events with a large-scale migration 大规模转变 from the Democratic Party 民主党 to the Republican Party 共和党. +

And why? Well, we could hardly explain it better than the man who won the presidency in that year, Ronald Reagan. In responding to the problem of the economic crisis 经济危机 that had laid the nation low 使国家陷入困境, he said: "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem." So for all those Boomers who had seen firsthand 亲眼目睹 the problem the government caused during the events of Vietnam, a candidate who said such a thing was able to win a majority of their votes. And why? Because events influence our voting behavior 投票行为. +

Then if we think about Millennials 千禧一代, the defining event 标志性事件 for that generation was the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001 2001年9月11日恐怖袭击事件. In the months following that event, there was a profound unification 深刻的团结 throughout the nation. However, once the dust settled 尘埃落定, Millennials began to articulate 表达 how this event didn't just come out of nowhere -- as if we Americans were just minding our own business 自顾自地做事 and these terrorists came and attacked us unprovoked 无缘无故地. Rather, Millennials were able to see that our world is more connected than ever before, and 9/11 was a result -- at least partially 至少部分地 -- of American over-intervention 过度干预 in the Middle East 中东 for decades 几十年. +

So in response to this event, Millennials have a keen sense of 敏锐的感知 foreign policy 外交政策 and how America interacts not just with itself but with the wider world. And so that event led them to vote for candidates who champion 支持 cooperation 合作 and bridge-building 建立联系 with foreign nations, rather than candidates who ran on a platform of 以…为竞选纲领 aggressive foreign policy 强硬的外交政策. So again, major events have a way of shaping 塑造 how we form our political beliefs and ultimately 最终 how we end up voting. +

Now the last thing I'm going to say: in all these examples that I've given, I've shown you how an event has influenced people to vote for one party or another. But again, those are just examples. There were plenty of people who opposed the New Deal 新政, and plenty who grew more devoted to the cause of aggressive American intervention throughout the world after 9/11. So I'm not suggesting that these political events will necessarily 必然地 push folks to vote one way or the other -- only that these major events will likely have a lasting effect 持久影响 on how people are politically socialized 政治社会化, whichever way they end up voting. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第四单元，在这个视频中，我们将讨论重要事件如何改变或者至少影响你的政治信仰。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释文化因素如何影响政治态度和政治社会化。在之前的几个视频中，我们一直在讨论一个叫做政治社会化的现象，这是我们形成政治信仰的过程。有很多因素会影响我们形成这些信仰——从我们的原生家庭，到我们在学校所学的东西，再到我们所属的代际——现在我们只需要在政治社会化的因素中再添加一个因素。一旦我们这么做，宝贝，我们就有了一锅 “大杂烩”（丰富的内容）。 +

我所说的这个因素就是AP课程的主导者们所说的政治事件，基本上，他们所说的政治事件指的是在我们国家生活中被认为重要的任何事件。并且，根据这个事件的重要程度，它可能会对我们的政治信仰产生不成比例的影响。所以让我给你举一些例子。再次强调，我在这里所说的一切都是一种概括——当然也有例外情况。 +

沉默的一代，如果你还记得的话，他们大致出生于20世纪20年代到1945年之间，他们在大萧条的艰难时期度过了成长阶段。失业现象猖獗，贫困变得越来越普遍。1932年，他们的父母选举富兰克林·D·罗斯福（Franklin D. Roosevelt）为总统，罗斯福对联邦政府的扩张程度会让乔治·华盛顿（George Washington）惊掉下巴。但他这么做是为了减轻美国人的痛苦，他的新政计划为失业者创造了就业机会，并以社会保障的形式建立了一个经济安全网。 +

现在，你是否同意这些政策并不是重点。重点是沉默的一代在难以想象的艰难环境中长大，他们目睹了联邦政府为了介入并提供帮助而进行的扩张。所以这个重大事件，再加上政府在第二次世界大战中的表现，使得这一代人相信政府会为了他们的安全和福祉进行干预，而这反过来又影响了他们的投票行为。 +

婴儿潮一代经历了越南战争，在《五角大楼文件》（Pentagon Papers）公布后，他们对政府的信任被彻底冲垮了，我们在第三单元讨论过《五角大楼文件》。很明显，政府一直在关于战争的性质和进展上撒谎。事实上，他们还目睹了理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）因参与一个非法的竞选连任阴谋而辞去总统职务。所以在1980年的选举中，婴儿潮一代对这些事件的反应是大规模地从支持民主党转向支持共和党。 +

为什么呢？嗯，我们很难比当年赢得总统职位的罗纳德·里根（Ronald Reagan）解释得更好了。在回应使国家陷入困境的经济危机问题时，他说：“在当前的危机中，政府不是我们问题的解决方案。政府本身就是问题。” 所以对于那些亲眼目睹政府在越南战争事件中引发问题的婴儿潮一代来说，说出这种话的候选人能够赢得他们的大多数选票。为什么呢？因为事件影响了我们的投票行为。 +

然后，如果我们考虑千禧一代，对这一代人来说，决定性的事件是2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击事件。在那次事件之后的几个月里，全国实现了深刻的团结。然而，一旦尘埃落定，千禧一代开始明确表示，这次事件并非毫无缘由——好像我们美国人只是在自顾自地做事，而这些恐怖分子无缘无故地来袭击我们一样。相反，千禧一代能够看到我们的世界比以往任何时候都更加相互关联，9·11事件至少在一定程度上是美国几十年来对中东过度干预的结果。 +

所以，针对这一事件，千禧一代对美国的外交政策以及美国不仅与自身而且与更广阔的世界的互动方式有着敏锐的认识。因此，这一事件使他们投票给那些倡导与外国合作和建立桥梁的候选人，而不是那些以激进外交政策为竞选纲领的候选人。所以，同样地，重大事件会影响我们形成政治信仰的方式，最终也会影响我们的投票结果。 +

最后我要说的是：在我给出的所有这些例子中，我向你展示了一个事件如何影响人们投票支持某一个政党。但同样，这些只是例子。有很多人反对新政，也有很多人在9·11事件后更加支持美国在世界各地的激进干预行动。所以我并不是说这些政治事件必然会促使人们以某种方式投票——只是说这些重大事件可能会对人们的政治社会化产生持久的影响，无论他们最终如何投票。 +
