Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. And this video is time to look at yet another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 New York Times v. the United States 纽约时报诉美国案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +  

Okay, so first of all -- as always -- let's get the facts of the case. In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam conflict 越南冲突, which was basically an undeclared war 未宣战的战争. And this was not a war that Americans felt great about, because the purpose of our involvement was not because we had been attacked or anything like that, but because of this kind of vague 模糊的 geopolitical 地缘政治的 purpose of containing 遏制 the spread of communism 共产主义. As it turned out 结果是, despite the magnitude 规模 of the U.S. military, we just weren't able to make much progress against the North Vietnamese. +  

So as tens of thousands of American men were dying for a war that Congress didn't even declare, the public grew cynical 愤世嫉俗的 about it. But President Johnson and then Richard Nixon just kept telling everyone, "Listen, we've almost won. We just need a few more men and just a little more time. Like everything is going great." Well, as it turned out, Nixon commissioned 委托 a top secret inquiry 绝密调查 into the history of the U.S. involvement in the war, and the findings 调查结果 were not flattering 有利的. It showed how presidents and agencies had systematically 系统性地 deceived 欺骗 the public concerning the war. +  

And much to Nixon's chagrin 懊恼, one of the guys who worked on the report leaked 泄露 huge portions of it to The New York Times and The Washington Post. And newspapers did what newspapers do, and started publishing these damning 揭露真相的 papers which confirmed 证实 what everyone suspected 怀疑 -- namely 即, our government is lying to us, and those lies are costing thousands of lives. Well, it only took one publication 出版 for the Nixon administration to send an order to the papers to cease 停止 publication of top secret documents 绝密文件 because it could threaten national security 国家安全. And this was a procedure 程序 called prior restraint 预先限制. In other words 换句话说, the Nixon administration tried to keep the paper from publishing these documents before they were printed. And that's how this case wound up 最终成为 before the Supreme Court. +  

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中? Well, this is pretty clearly a First Amendment 第一修正案 case -- specifically 具体来说, a case about the First Amendment's protection of the freedom of the press 新闻自由. The New York Times claimed that Nixon's invocation 援引 of prior restraint violated 违反 their First Amendment rights. The Nixon administration argued that prior restraint was justified 合理的 in this case because the publication of these papers would threaten national security. +  

So what was the decision? Well, the court agreed with The New York Times that the Nixon administration's restraining order 限制令 was unconstitutional 违宪的, and therefore allowed the paper to continue printing the Pentagon Papers 五角大楼文件. And in the opinion 意见书 handed down by the court, they said that, quote, "Any system of prior restraints comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption 推定 against its constitutional validity 合宪性." In other words, whenever a case involving the freedom of the press comes before the court, the bar to clear for prior restraint is very high. +  

Now to be fair 公平地说, the opinion also made clear that prior restraint can be used if it is really a matter of national security. For example, if a New York Times reporter decided to publish the day and time and landing location of the D-Day invasion 诺曼底登陆, well yeah, you can't do that. Prior restraint is justified in that case. But in this case, Nixon just didn't want to be exposed as a deceitful 欺诈的 turd （俚语，可鄙的人）who would lie to the American people, and that my friends is exactly what the free press is for. +  

So why does this case matter? The decision is of course hailed 被誉为 as a victory for the free press against censorship 审查制度. And despite the criticism that it has received for being overly vague 过于模糊的 on exactly when prior restraint can be invoked 援引, the decision made it very hard to censor 审查 the free press ever since. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即“《纽约时报》诉美国案（New York Times v. the United States）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

首先——和往常一样——我们来了解案件事实。20世纪60年代末至70年代，美国卷入了越南冲突，这基本上是一场未正式宣战的战争。美国人对这场战争并无好感，因为我们参战的目的并非受到攻击或其他类似原因，而是出于遏制共产主义传播这一模糊的地缘政治目的。事实证明，尽管美军规模庞大，我们却始终未能在对抗北越的战争中取得重大进展。 +  

当成千上万的美国士兵为一场国会甚至未正式宣战的战争丧生时，公众对此逐渐产生了怀疑。但约翰逊总统和随后的理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）却一直对所有人说：“听着，我们几乎要赢了。我们只需要再多一些兵力和一点时间。一切都进展顺利。” 然而，尼克松委托对美国参战历史进行了一项绝密调查，调查结果并不光彩。它揭示了总统和各机构如何系统性地就战争问题欺骗公众。 +  

令尼克松懊恼的是，参与该报告撰写的一名工作人员将报告的大部分内容泄露给了《纽约时报》（The New York Times）和《华盛顿邮报》（The Washington Post）。报纸履行了其职责，开始刊登这些揭露性文件，证实了所有人的猜想——即我们的政府在对我们撒谎，而这些谎言正在让数千人失去生命。仅在一篇报道发表后，尼克松政府就向这些报纸发出命令，要求停止刊登绝密文件，称其可能威胁国家安全。这一程序被称为“预先限制（prior restraint）”。换句话说，尼克松政府试图在报纸印刷前阻止其发表这些文件。这就是该案件最终提交至最高法院的原因。 +  

这里涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？显然，这是一个与宪法第一修正案（First Amendment）相关的案件——具体而言，是关于第一修正案对新闻自由的保护的案件。《纽约时报》声称，尼克松政府的预先限制侵犯了其第一修正案权利。尼克松政府则辩称，本案中的预先限制是合理的，因为这些文件的发表将威胁国家安全。 +  

判决结果如何呢？最高法院支持了《纽约时报》的主张，认定尼克松政府的限制令违宪，因此允许该报继续刊登《五角大楼文件》（Pentagon Papers）。最高法院在判决意见中指出，“任何预先限制制度在提交至本院时，均应承担其合宪性存疑的重大推定。” 换句话说，每当涉及新闻自由的案件提交至法院时，预先限制的适用门槛都非常高。 +  

公平地说，判决意见也明确表示，如果确实涉及国家安全，预先限制是可以使用的。例如，如果《纽约时报》的一名记者决定刊登诺曼底登陆的日期、时间和登陆地点，那么显然不能这样做。在这种情况下，预先限制是合理的。但在本案中，尼克松只是不想被曝光为一个会对美国人民撒谎的虚伪之徒，而朋友们，这恰恰就是新闻自由存在的意义。 +  

这个案件为何重要呢？该判决当然被誉为新闻自由对抗审查制度的胜利。尽管有人批评该判决在“究竟何时可以援引预先限制”的问题上过于模糊，但自那以后，该判决使得审查新闻自由变得极为困难。 +
