<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The civil rights movement created a climate of protest that inspired other discontented minority groups.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Native Americans, Hispanics, and gays all formed movements demanding that America address their grievances.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NATIVE AMERICANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1970, the Native American population numbered about 800,000 people. Largely ignored by the rest of the country, Native Americans comprised the nation’s least prosperous and least healthy group. For example, they suffered from an unemployment rate ten times the national average and had an average lifespan of just forty-six, twenty years less than the national average.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1968, a group of young militant Native Americans embraced the concept of “Red Power” by forming the American Indian Movement (AIM). Inspired by the Black Power movement, AIM activists staged protests designed to draw attention to tribal grievances. For example, in November 1969 a group of American Indians began a 19-month occupation of the abandoned federal prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. The prolonged occupation demonstrated a resurgence of Native American pride.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In February 1973, AIM staged a dramatic and symbolic takeover of the village of Wounded Knee, site of the infamous 1890 massacre of Sioux by federal troops. AIM used the 71-day standoff with federal authorities to demand changes in the administration of the Pine Ridge Reservation.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Native American demonstrations gained publicity and achieved concrete results. For example, the Nixon administration supported the Indian Education Act providing federal funds for new schools that would be under tribal control.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_270"/>C.</strong></span><strong>HISPANIC AMERICANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Hispanics are a large and diverse group that includes migrants from Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central America, and Mexico. The 1960 census reported 3 million Hispanics living in the United States, the great majority of whom were Mexican Americans. This number grew to 9.6 million in 1970 and to 14.5 million in 1980.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Delano, California, is a major agricultural community where growers produce half the world’s supply of table grapes. In 1962, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), which later became better known as the United Farm Workers (UFW), to represent the thousands of vineyard workers. Three years later, they began the Delano Grape Strike against growers who refused to recognize the UFW.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Chavez vowed “to resist with every ounce of human endurance and spirit.” Inspired by Dr. King’s nonviolent tactics, Chavez staged a 28-day hunger strike, led peaceful protest marches, and appealed for a nationwide boycott of grapes. Pressured by a boycott that grew to include 17 million consumers, growers signed a contract recognizing the UFW.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Like their Native American and African American counterparts, young Mexican Americans became more militant. In 1969, fifteen hundred Mexican students met in Denver to formulate a more aggressive political and cultural agenda. They proclaimed a new term, <em>Chicano</em>, to replace <em>Mexican American</em>, and later organized a political party, La Raza Unita (The United Race), to promote such Chicano goals as bilingual education and Chicano studies programs.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>GAY AMERICANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1960s, most states defined homosexuality as an immoral and illegal activity. Police used vice laws to harass and arrest gay men and lesbians.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Stonewall Inn was a popular gay bar in New York City’s Greenwich Village. Police officers raided the inn during the early morning hours of June 28, 1969. The raids provoked spontaneous demonstrations calling for an end to police harassment.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Stonewall Riots played a key role in sparking the modern Gay Liberation Movement. One year later, thousands of people marched in New York City’s Gay Pride Parade. By 1973 there were about 800 gay organizations across the country.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_271"/>4<span class="C344">.</span>The Gay Liberation Movement won a number of significant victories during the 1970s. For example, in 1973 the board of the American Psychiatric Association voted to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. Four years later, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay person elected to public office in California, when he won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the early 1960s, the average housewife spent 55 hours a week on domestic chores. Betty Friedan’s research indicated that this endless routine of housework deeply frustrated college-educated housewives. Friedan expressed this frustration in her book <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span><em>The Feminine Mystique</em> sold 3 million copies and helped spark a “second wave” of the American feminist movement. Inspired by Friedan, a new generation of women took up the call for gender equality.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The public’s response to <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> was not the only factor responsible for the revival of the feminist movement. The spirit of protest that energized the civil rights, anti-war, and minority liberation movements also served as a catalyst for discontented women.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN (NOW)</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed sexual discrimination in employment, but much work remained to be done. Employers routinely paid women lower salaries than men and often denied them opportunities to advance.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1966, twenty-eight women’s rights activists created the National Organization for Women (NOW) “to bring American women into full participation in the mainstream of American society NOW.”</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_272"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>With Friedan as its first president, NOW challenged sexual discrimination in the workplace, funded suits for equal wages, lobbied companies to provide day care for infant children, and demanded an end to want ads appearing in sex-segregated newspaper columns.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>RADICAL FEMINISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A younger, more radical group of feminists challenged NOW’s leadership. Radical feminists argued “assumptions of male supremacy are as . . . crippling to women as assumptions of white supremacy are to the Negro.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Radical feminists vowed to eradicate sexism and promote “women’s liberation.” Militant feminists focused on personal issues such as reproductive rights, domestic violence, and the objectification of women as sexual objects.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>FEMINIST SUCCESSES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Title IX of the 1972 Higher Education Act required schools to give equal opportunities to women in admissions and athletics. In 1970, just 15 percent of women participated in intercollegiate sports. Ten years later the rate of participation doubled to 30 percent.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In its landmark 1973 decision in <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> the Supreme Court ruled that abortion is protected by the right to privacy implied by the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Women broke through a number of employment barriers. For example, America saw its first female firefighters, railroad engineers, airline pilots, and construction workers. In politics, Connecticut’s Ella Grasso became the first elected woman governor of a state.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1970s all five military academies enrolled women. By 1980, very few all-male colleges remained. One student accurately reflected the shift in attitudes when he concluded, “Life is coed, school should be also.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1972, Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) and then sent it on to the states for ratification. The amendment stated that, “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The ERA quickly passed in 35 of the 38 state legislatures needed for ratification. However, opponents led by Phyllis Schlafly mounted <span id="page_273"/>a successful campaign to block the ERA. The defeat of the ERA marked a significant setback for the women’s rights movement.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: WOMEN’S RIGHTS MOVEMENTS, 1890–1920 AND 1960–1980</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Middle-class white women dominated the women’s movements in both periods. Women in both eras formed organizations to promote feminist agendas. For example, both the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and the National Organization for Women (NOW) worked to increase women’s access to higher education and to professional schools.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the period from 1890 to 1920, the women’s rights movement successfully focused its energies on winning passage of the Nineteenth Amendment granting women suffrage. In contrast, during the 1960s and 1970s the women’s rights movement failed to achieve passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong><em>SILENT SPRING</em>, 1962</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1950s, most biologists accepted the prevailing view that DDT and other chemical pesticides were useful tools to eradicate mosquitoes and other harmful insect pests. However, an American marine biologist named Rachel Carson conducted research indicating that DDT and other chemicals were in fact having an inimical effect upon the nation’s wildlife.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Carson published her findings in <em>Silent Spring</em>, a groundbreaking book that helped launch the environmental movement.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In January 1969, an oil rig explosion in the Santa Barbara Channel turned miles of pristine Southern California beaches into an environmental nightmare killing thousands of seabirds and marine animals. Just six months later an oil slick on the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, caught fire and burned two railroad bridges.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>These two highly publicized disasters alarmed the public. On April 22, 1970, over 20 million concerned citizens participated in the nation’s first annual Earth Day. Fully 70 percent of the public ranked the environment as America’s most pressing problem.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_274"/>C.</strong></span><strong>CONGRESS RESPONDS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Congress responded to the public outcry by enacting a far-reaching program of environmental legislation. The Clean Air Act set strict standards to reduce automobile and factory emissions. The Water Pollution Control Act provided funds to protect America’s sea coasts and clean up its neglected rivers and lakes. The Endangered Species Act protected rare plants and animals from extinction.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In addition to these measures the Nixon administration banned the use of DDT and created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enforce a range of environmental guidelines.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>VIETNAMIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon inherited a difficult situation in Vietnam. He found himself squeezed between an impatient public at home and an intransigent enemy abroad.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon and his National Security Advisor, Dr. Henry Kissinger, developed a “two-track” strategy to end American involvement and prevent the North Vietnamese from conquering South Vietnam. First, they would continue peace negotiations. Second, they began a policy called Vietnamization whereby Nixon gradually withdrew American troops, leaving the burden of fighting to the South Vietnamese.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon appealed to “the great silent majority” of Americans to support his policies. The silent majority included “non-shouters and non-demonstrators” who often lived in Sun Belt states. This conservative group formed the core of a new Republican coalition of voters.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CAMBODIA AND KENT STATE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon’s strategy of Vietnamization appeared to be working. Then, on April 30, 1970, Nixon surprised the nation by sending American <span id="page_275"/>ground troops into Cambodia. The president explained that enemy forces used bases inside Cambodia to launch raids on South Vietnam. Nixon insisted the bases had to be destroyed to enable more American forces to leave Vietnam.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon’s announcement stunned the nation. Outraged doves questioned the President’s strategy of shortening the war by escalating it. Skepticism turned to anger as indignant college students protested the Cambodian invasion.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Police and the National Guard were called upon to maintain order on some college campuses. Then, on March 4, 1970, tragedy struck at Kent State University in Ohio. Frightened National Guard soldiers opened fire on demonstrators, killing four student bystanders.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>News of the Kent State shootings ignited a tidal wave of protests as over 400 colleges closed or suspended exams and almost 100,000 antiwar demonstrators staged a protest march in Washington. Nixon later wrote, “Those few days after Kent State were among the darkest of my presidency.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE PARIS PEACE ACCORDS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>After three more years of bloody fighting and intense U.S. bombing, the peace negotiations between Henry Kissinger and the North Vietnamese reached a conclusion. On January 23, 1973, President Nixon announced that an agreement had been reached “to end the war and bring peace with honor to Vietnam and Southeast Asia.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Paris Peace Accords called for the U.S. to withdraw its remaining 23,700 troops and advisors within 60 days. In return, the North Vietnamese would release almost 600 American prisoners of war. The agreement left the South Vietnamese government in power, but permitted almost 150,000 North Vietnamese troops to remain in South Vietnam.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE FALL OF SAIGON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon assured the South Vietnamese government that the United States would “respond with full force should the settlement be violated by North Vietnam.” But the 1973 War Powers Act prevented Nixon from keeping his promise. Passed over Nixon’s veto, the legislation requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids American troops from remaining for more than 60 days without Congressional authorization. At the same time, <span id="page_276"/>the ongoing Watergate scandal weakened Nixon and led to his resignation.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The North Vietnamese recognized that America would no longer take forceful action to protect South Vietnam. In March 1975, they launched a powerful armored invasion of South Vietnam. As the North Vietnamese advanced upon Saigon, helicopters rescued the last remaining Americans. The South Vietnamese government surrendered on April 30, 1975.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF THE VIETNAM WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Vietnam War claimed a staggering death toll. More than 58,000 U.S. troops died and another 300,000 were wounded. The war killed an estimated 2 million Vietnamese civilians, 1.1 million North Vietnamese troops, and 200,000 South Vietnamese soldiers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The war played a key role in the Nixon administration’s decision to replace the draft with an all-volunteer military force.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The massive bombing campaigns left both North and South Vietnam in ruins. The U.S. Army’s use of herbicides such as Agent Orange devastated Vietnam’s natural environment.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The war created widespread public distrust of the U.S. government. For example, the publication of the <em>Pentagon Papers</em> in 1971 confirmed suspicions that the Johnson administration had deliberately misled the public about America’s reasons for escalating the war.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The polarizing public debate over the war divided families, friends, and eventually the entire nation. It shattered the liberal consensus supporting the Great Society. In addition, the Vietnam War helped fuel the conservative resurgence supported by the rising influence of the silent majority.</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>The Vietnam War created skepticism about international involvements called the “Vietnam Syndrome.” Many Americans questioned foreign entanglements that might lead to “another Vietnam.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the years after World War II, American leaders divided the world into two rival blocks of nations—the Communist World and <span id="page_277"/>the Free World. As the leader of the Free World, the U.S. attempted to contain Soviet expansion and isolate the People’s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon and Kissinger believed that time had come to pursue bold foreign policy initiatives that would reshape global politics. On July 15, 1971, Nixon stunned the world by announcing he would accept an invitation to visit the PRC in February 1972.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>OPENING TIES TO CHINA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon’s historic trip marked the first time a U.S. president had visited the PRC. For eight days and nights, enthralled American television audiences watched as Nixon met with Chairman Mao Zedong, exchanged toasts with Premier Zhou Enlai, and visited the Great Wall.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>At the end of his visit Nixon proudly proclaimed, “This was the week that changed the world.” His visit ended a quarter of a century of separation between the U.S. and China. In a joint statement known as the Shanghai Communiqué, the two countries promised to begin new relations in trade, travel, and cultural exchanges.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: U.S.–CHINESE RELATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As Nixon’s visit ended, Premier Zhou Enlai predicted, “The gates of friendship have been opened.” Subsequent years did witness a growth and widening of ties between the U.S. and China. For example, the two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Today America’s relationship with China is characterized by the simultaneous existence of friendship and friction. Cultural ties include 235,000 Chinese students currently studying in American colleges and universities. Economic ties have dramatically expanded as China is now the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt. Nonetheless, tensions still exist on issues such as cybersecurity, tariffs, human rights, and Chinese military ambitions in the South China Sea.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>ESTABLISHING DÉTENTE WITH THE SOVIET UNION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Three months after returning from China, Nixon stunned the world again by becoming the first American president to visit Moscow. During the seven-day summit, Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev agreed upon a joint space mission and signed a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. Although the SALT I agreement did not end <span id="page_278"/>the nuclear arms race, it did place limitations on both the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles and the construction of anti-ballistic missile systems.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The SALT I treaty signaled the beginning of a new period of détente or relaxed tensions between the two rival superpowers.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE ARAB OIL EMBARGO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. Although American military aid enabled Israel to prevail, the effects of the war continued.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon’s decision to help Israel angered many oil-rich nations. As the most important members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), they had the power to reduce the supply of oil and raise prices. On October 20,1973, they chose to do both.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Arab oil embargo quickly disrupted daily life across the United States. Motorists who had assumed that gasoline would always be cheap and plentiful found themselves waiting in long gas lines, forming carpools, and watching helplessly as gas prices nearly doubled.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The effects of the energy crisis did not end with the resumption of oil shipments in April 1974. The oil embargo marked the end of the post–World War II economic boom and the beginning of an inflationary spiral that plagued the U.S. economy during the rest of the 1970s and into the early 1980s.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>WATERGATE SCANDAL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On June 17, 1972, police arrested five burglars who had broken into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate apartment and office complex in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>President Nixon was never directly implicated in the Watergate break-in. However, instead of firing the corrupt officials responsible for the crime, he chose to “play it tough” and attempt to cover up the scandal. Two months after the break-in, Nixon announced that a “complete investigation” found “no one in the White House staff, no one in this administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident.” Nixon was lying. Evidence from <span id="page_279"/>secret White House tapes later revealed a “smoking gun” proving that Nixon ordered the CIA to stop the FBI from investigating the Watergate break-in. This constituted a clear example of deliberate obstruction of justice.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The House Judiciary Committee ultimately voted to recommend that Nixon be impeached. On August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon became the first president to resign from office. Vice President Gerald Ford then became the nation’s 38th president. “My fellow Americans,” Ford reassured, “our long national nightmare is over.” Ford later pardoned Nixon to great public uproar.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF WATERGATE</strong></p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>STAGFLATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Carter began his presidency with high hopes. However, he soon faced a seemingly intractable economic problem. The American economy was simultaneously experiencing a combination of double-digit inflation and rising unemployment. Economists called this unusual phenomenon stagflation.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Stagflation had at least two deep-rooted causes. First, President Johnson attempted to pay for both the Vietnam War and the Great Society without raising taxes, thus creating strong inflationary pressures. Second, the U.S. economy had become dangerously dependent upon inexpensive imported oil. The OPEC price increases played a significant role in driving up the cost of everything from gasoline to groceries.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_280"/>B.</strong></span><strong>THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Carter pursued an idealistic foreign policy. He promised to defend human rights, pledging that his actions would be guided by “fairness not force.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Carter’s commitment to patient negotiating achieved a dramatic breakthrough in Middle East diplomacy. In September 1978, he invited Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to meet with him at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. After 13 days of tense negotiations, a beaming Carter announced that the two sides had reached a historic peace agreement. Under the terms of the Camp David Accords, Israel agreed to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt and the two nations pledged to sign a peace treaty ending thirty years of hostility.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Camp David Accords marked Carter’s greatest triumph. Within a year, events in Iran plunged the Carter presidency into a crisis it was unable to successfully resolve. On November 4, 1979, a mob stormed the American embassy in Tehran and took more than 50 Americans hostage. After months of futile negotiations, Carter authorized a secret rescue mission that failed.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Iranian hostage crisis, double-digit inflation, and the continued rise in energy prices seriously weakened Carter’s popularity. Opinion polls reported less than 25 percent of the public approved his leadership.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE ELECTION OF 1980</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1980 presidential campaign, the Republican candidate Ronald Reagan repeatedly asked the American people to answer one question: “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On Election Day, voters overwhelmingly answered “no.” Reagan and his running mate, George H. W. Bush, won a landslide victory.</p>
