<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE COTTON GIN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the late 1700s, a series of technological developments revolutionized the textile industry in Great Britain. The new inventions enabled British factories to turn cotton fibers into a cloth that was cooler and more comfortable than wool. These advances created a seemingly insatiable demand for raw cotton.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Southern farms could not meet the demand for raw cotton because of the difficulty of separating the fluffy cotton fiber from its sticky seeds. It required a full day for one laborer to remove the seeds from a pound of cotton.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1793, Eli Whitney invented a machine that could perform this tedious chore. His cotton engine or “gin” enabled slaves to clean fifty times as much cotton as could be done by hand.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The cotton gin revolutionized the Southern economy. Cotton production soared from just 9,000 bales in 1791 to 987,000 in 1831 and 4 million in 1860. This represented a prodigious number since each bale contained 500 pounds of cotton!</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KING COTTON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Cotton quickly became America’s most valuable cash crop. By the 1840s, cotton production accounted for over half the value of all American exports.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The excessive cultivation of tobacco had depleted the soil in the Chesapeake states. Ambitious planters looked south and west for fertile new land. They found them in a vast region of fertile land stretching from Georgia to Louisiana. Known as the black belt because of its rich black soil, this region soon produced two-thirds of the world’s supply of cotton. Proud Southern planters confidently boasted, “Cotton is King.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_84"/>C.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: THE IMPACT OF THE COTTON ECONOMY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Cotton irrevocably altered the South’s attitude toward slavery. As the South became committed to a one-crop cotton economy, it also became committed to slavery. Of the 2.5 million slaves engaged in agriculture in 1850, 75 percent worked at cotton production.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The presence of slavery discouraged immigrants from moving to the South. In 1860 just 4.4 percent of the Southern population was foreign-born. Meanwhile, between 1844 and 1854 over 3 million European immigrants flooded into eastern seaports.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>As the South devoted more and more resources to growing cotton, the region lagged behind the North in trade and manufacturing. Southern cotton was primarily exported in Northern vessels. While Northern factories produced manufactured goods at an ever-increasing rate, Southern farmers purchased finished goods under a credit system that kept them in debt.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The South’s commitment to growing cotton slowed urban growth. With the exception of New Orleans and Charleston, the South had few urban centers. Instead, most Southerners lived on widely dispersed farms and plantations.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Taken together, the South’s reliance upon cotton and slaves and its slow rate of industrialization and urbanization removed it from the dynamic innovations taking place in the North and West. As these forces of change accelerated, the South became committed to preserving and defending its distinctive regional identity.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>PLANTERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Planters comprised just 4 percent of the South’s adult white male population. This small but powerful group owned more than half of all the slaves and harvested most of the region’s cotton and tobacco.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A wealthy elite, planters dominated Southern economic and social life. The image of a paternalistic planter who lived in a white-columned mansion came to embody a distinctive way of life that valued tradition, honor, and genteel manners.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_85"/>B.</strong></span><strong>YEOMAN FARMERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The majority of white families in the antebellum South were independent yeoman farmers who owned few, if any, slaves.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although the South’s numerical majority, yeoman farmers did not set the region’s political and social tone. Instead, they deferred to the large planters since many aspired to become large planters themselves.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>POOR WHITES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As many as 25 to 40 percent of white Southerners were unskilled laborers who owned no land and no slaves. These “poor whites” often lived in the backwoods where they scratched out a meager living doing odd jobs.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although they did not own slaves and frequently resented the aristocratic planters, poor whites nonetheless supported the South’s biracial social structure. The existence of slavery enabled even the most impoverished white to feel superior to black people. Poor whites, yeoman farmers, and planters all shared a sense of white supremacy that bridged class distinctions.</p>

<p class="C568"><strong><em>Many students mistakenly believe that most white Southerners owned slaves. This is incorrect. It is important to remember that three-quarters of white Southern families owned no slaves</em>.</strong></p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE DOMESTIC SLAVE TRADE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Congress outlawed the African slave trade in 1808. The spread of cotton plantations into the black belt caused a major change in the movement and distribution of slavery. In 1790, planters in Virginia and Maryland owned 56 percent of all enslaved Africans. Between 1800 and 1860, tobacco-depleted Chesapeake planters sold about one million slaves to planters in a region stretching from western Georgia to eastern Texas known as the Deep South.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The domestic slave trade uprooted countless families. Despite forced separation and harsh living conditions, slaves maintained strong kinship networks while creating a distinct African American culture. Religion played a particularly important role. For example, <span id="page_86"/>spiritual songs enabled slaves to express their sorrows, joys, and hopes for a better life.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>RESISTANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Slaves tried to escape when they could. For example, in 1841, slaves being shipped from Norfolk, Virginia, to New Orleans forced the captain to sail to the Bahamas where Britain had abolished slavery in 1833.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Slave revolts were infrequent. With the exception of Nat Turner’s insurrection in 1831, vigilant planters successfully suppressed slave rebellions. Many slaves retaliated against their masters by slowing the pace of work, damaging equipment, and feigning illness.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>FREE BLACKS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Not all blacks were slaves. By 1860, as many as 250,000 free blacks lived in the South. Many of these “free persons of color” were the descendants of men and women who had been freed by idealistic owners following the Revolutionary War. Others successfully purchased their freedom.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Free blacks occupied a precarious position in Southern society. For example, they were often subject to discriminatory laws that denied them property rights and forbade them from working in certain professions and testifying against whites in court.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>SLAVERY AS A “NECESSARY EVIL”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the late 1700s, many Southern leaders referred to slavery as a “necessary evil” inherited from their colonial past.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Leading Southern statesmen such as Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe advocated a policy of gradually emancipating slaves while at the same time compensating their owners.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SLAVERY AS A “POSITIVE GOOD”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the early 1830s slaveholders advanced a systematic argument to justify what they called “our peculiar institution.” The word “peculiar” did not mean odd or strange. Instead, it referred to something distinctive or characteristic of the Southern way of life.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_87"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>First expressed by John C. Calhoun, the “positive good” argument insisted that slaves benefitted from a benign and paternalistic institution. They argued that well-cared-for slaves actually had lives that were as good or better than the lives of so-called wage slaves working in textile mills in New England.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Proslavery advocates pointed to citations in the Bible condoning slavery. They also used “scientific” theories of their day to create a false image of blacks as inferior people who required paternal white guardianship.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Planters warned that slavery was vital to the South’s and to the nation’s economy. They vowed to resist any attempt to interfere with their “peculiar institution.”</p>

<p class="C568"><strong><em>APUSH exam writers often use quotes by John C. Calhoun and other Southern leaders to illustrate the “positive good” argument. This view contributed to increased sectional tensions between the North and the South during the 1850s</em>.</strong></p>
