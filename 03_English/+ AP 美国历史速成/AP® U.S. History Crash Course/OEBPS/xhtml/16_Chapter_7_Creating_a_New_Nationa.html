<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The victory over Great Britain created a new nation. Unlike the Old World nations of Europe, America had no monarchy or aristocracy. But it did have a sense of mission to lead the world toward liberty and equality.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>American leaders faced the still unresolved issue of creating a new form of government. The American Revolution thus remained unfinished.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>A FLAWED “LEAGUE OF FRIENDSHIP”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The thirteen original states ratified the Articles of Confederation in 1781. The new government created a confederation or loose union among sovereign states. The Continental Congress created a confederation because it wanted to avoid giving the new government powers it had just denied to Parliament. Instead it formed a “firm league of friendship” that could not exercise powers independent of the states.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Articles of Confederation constructed a government consisting of only a unicameral legislature. It gave the Congress responsibilities that included authority over coinage, the postal service, Indian affairs, and western territories.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The new government had little authority to fulfill its responsibilities. The central government included no judicial or executive branches. It had no power to levy taxes or regulate interstate commerce; likewise, it could not enforce its resolutions upon either the states or individual citizens.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ACHIEVEMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Despite its weaknesses, the Confederate government successfully won the Revolutionary War and negotiated the Treaty of Paris ending the war on terms favorable to the United States.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_50"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established an orderly procedure for territories to become states. The new states would not be subordinate colonies. They would instead be admitted as equals into the American republic.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The ordinance also banned slavery from the Northwest Territory. This fateful decision created a line between freedom and slavery that extended north of the Ohio River and all the way to the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: SHAYS’ REBELLION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Causes</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Impoverished farmers in Massachusetts were losing their land because they did not have enough hard currency to repay their debts to eastern merchants and bankers.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>The desperate farmers demanded that the state legislature halt farm foreclosures, lower property taxes, print paper money, and end imprisonment for debt.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>Led by Daniel Shays, a former captain in the Continental Army, armed farmers closed a courthouse where creditors were suing to foreclose farm mortgages.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">d.</span>The Massachusetts state legislature and the national Congress were unable to raise a militia to stop Shays. In January 1787, alarmed Bostonians financed a hastily formed army of 4,000 men who quickly crushed the insurrection.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Consequences</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Just before Shays’ Rebellion, five states sent delegates to Annapolis, Maryland, to discuss trade problems. Although the delegates failed to resolve the commercial problems, they did call upon Congress to summon a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Shays’ Rebellion frightened conservative leaders who feared that an unchecked democratic mob would destroy orderly government and threaten private property.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>The “great commotion” in Massachusetts fueled dissatisfaction with the Articles of Confederation. It convinced George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and other key leaders that the United States needed a stronger national government.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On May 25, 1787, 55 delegates from every state except Rhode Island met in Philadelphia. The delegates quickly resolved to abandon the Articles of Confederation and create a new government.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During about four months of intense negotiations the delegates seized control of America’s destiny. They skillfully resolved a series of contentious issues by reaching compromises that distinguished the possible from the impossible.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KEY PRINCIPLES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Framers believed that government derives its just powers from the consent of the people. Widespread ownership of property provides a necessary foundation for representative government.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Government should be limited and power should be divided into separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches tied together by a complex system of checks and balances.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Political parties or factions are undesirable but inevitable. Left unchecked they will threaten the existence of representative government.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>A large republic will curb factions. Madison reasoned in <em>Federalist No. 10</em> that “in an expanding Republic, so many different groups and viewpoints would be included in the Congress that tyranny by the majority would be impossible.”</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>American republican principles would be best implemented by a federal system of government in which a written constitution divides power between a central government and state governments.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE GREAT COMPROMISE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Great Compromise resolved a fractious dispute between the large states led by Virginia and the small states led by New Jersey.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Great Compromise created a bicameral, or two-house, Congress. Representation in the House of Representatives would be apportioned on the basis of population, while each state would be allotted two seats in the Senate.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_52"/>D.</strong></span><strong>KEY PROVISIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A Congress with the authority to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A Necessary and Proper Clause, also known as the elastic clause, that gives Congress the power to make laws necessary for carrying out its enumerated powers.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>An Electoral College designed to insulate the presidency from the threat of “excessive democracy.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>An independent Supreme Court with justices appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Senators chosen by the state legislatures. This would help protect Congress from what Hamilton called “the imprudence of democracy.”</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>A constitutional process for impeaching the President.</p>
<p class="C369">7<span class="C344">.</span>An amendment process that made the Constitution a living and flexible document.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>KEY OMISSIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A Bill of Rights (added in 1791 as the first ten amendments)</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Direct election of Senators (added by the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913)</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Two-term limit for Presidents (added by the Twenty-second Amendment in 1951)</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>TURNING POINTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY: THE CONSTITUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Constitution marked a momentous turning point in American political history. In a bold and unprecedented decision, the Framers transferred sovereignty from the states to the people.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Constitution did not mark the beginning of momentous social changes. The revolutionary rhetoric about equality and natural rights did not change the status of enslaved Africans and women.</p>

<p class="C568"><strong><em>APUSH test writers often qualify questions on the Constitution with the phrase “as ratified in 1788.” Remember, the Bill of Rights was not part of the Constitution ratified in 1788.

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE FIRST EMANCIPATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As the Framers met in Philadelphia, a “First Emancipation” was already taking place in the North. At that time, Northern states had eliminated or were gradually eliminating slavery.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In addition, the Confederation Congress had already excluded slavery from the Northwest Territory. As a result, slavery was becoming a distinctive Southern institution.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE THREE-FIFTHS COMPROMISE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Constitution did not actually use the words “slave” or “slavery.” Afraid of alienating the Southern states, the Framers agreed to the Three-Fifths Compromise whereby slaves (euphemistically called “other persons”) were treated as three-fifths of a person for purposes of taxation and representation. This gave the Southern states an enlarged vote in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Three-Fifths Compromise was later repealed by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment process thus enabled the Constitution to be a living document that could advance the democratic principles stated in its Preamble and in the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SLAVE TRADE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Many delegates abhorred the slave trade and wanted to immediately abolish it. Gouverneur Morris underscored slavery’s moral outrage by declaring that, “The inhabitant of Georgia and South Carolina who goes to the Coast of Africa, and in defiance of the most sacred laws of humanity tears away his fellow creatures from their dearest connections and damns them to the most cruel bondage, shall have more votes in a Government instituted for the protection of the rights of mankind than the citizens of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Delegates from South Carolina and Georgia ignored Morris’ moral argument pointing out that they needed to continue the slave trade in order to replenish slaves evacuated by the British during the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Madison, pragmatic delegates wanted to avoid a dispute with the South that would fracture the convention. “Great as the evil is,” Madison wrote, “a dismemberment of the union would be worse.”</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_54"/>4<span class="C344">.</span>The convention resolved the issue by agreeing to a compromise in which Congress would not interfere with the slave trade until 1808.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>WOMEN IN COLONIAL AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A woman usually lost control of her property when she married.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A married woman had no separate legal identity apart from her husband.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>An adult woman could not vote, hold a political office, or serve on a jury.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>An adult woman had no legal rights over her children. A divorce was very difficult to obtain.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>“REMEMBER THE LADIES”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Abigail Adams and her husband John exchanged over 1,200 letters. This correspondence contains a treasure trove of revealing insights into the thoughts of one of the most prominent and articulate couples in colonial America.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On March 31, 1776, Abigail wrote a celebrated letter to John, who was then serving as the Massachusetts representative to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Keenly aware that the delegates were on the brink of composing a Declaration of Independence, Abigail urged her husband to “remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Like most of his male contemporaries, John Adams refused to apply the logic of liberty to the status of women. He sarcastically replied, “I cannot but laugh.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Abigail’s famous request underscored the fact that colonial women were treated as second-class citizens. Her letter demonstrated that some colonial women were aware of the discrepancy between the republican ideal of equality and the reality of how women were treated.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>REPUBLICAN MOTHERHOOD</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Neither the revolutionary ferment nor the new Constitution changed the legal status of women. But the spirit of republicanism <span id="page_55"/>did lead to the conclusion that every citizen had a stake in maintaining the nation’s hard-won liberty.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The American Revolution led to expanded support for women’s education. In his influential essay, “Thoughts on Female Education,” Benjamin Rush argued that women should be educated so they could instruct “their sons in the principles of liberty and government.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The idea of republican motherhood began to emerge after the Revolutionary War. Its advocates stressed that the new American republic offered women the important role of raising their children to be virtuous and responsible citizens. By instructing their children, especially their sons, in the principles of liberty, women played a key role in shaping America’s moral and political character.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: WOMEN’S RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Like Abigail Adams, other American women petitioned for expanded legal rights. However, their letters and protests led to limited reforms.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Seneca Falls Convention (1848) marked the beginning of the women’s rights movement in the United States. The Declaration of Sentiments opened by boldly declaring, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal.” The document did more than urge the male politicians to remember the ladies; it demanded greater legal rights and the extension of the suffrage to women.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Framers did not submit the proposed Constitution to the state legislatures. Instead they arbitrarily declared it would go into effect when ratified by conventions held in at least nine of the thirteen states.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_56"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>A fiercely contested debate erupted between Antifederalists who opposed the Constitution and Federalists who supported it.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Antifederalists drew their primary support from rural areas and small farmers. In contrast, Federalists drew their primary support from urban areas, large landowners, and wealthy merchants.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KEY ANTIFEDERALIST ARGUMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Warned that the proposed Constitution would create a powerful central government dominated by a “great and mighty President” and a Senate composed of wealthy men who would “swallow up all of us little folks.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Argued that the proposed Constitution would not work in a large nation with diverse interests. They maintained that a republican form of government works best in a small nation “close to the people.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Insisted that the United States should remain a group of small sovereign states tied together only for trade and defense.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Pointed out that the proposed Constitution did not contain a Bill of Rights to safeguard individual liberties.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>KEY FEDERALIST ARGUMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Warned that Shays’ Rebellion demonstrated that the Articles of Confederation lacked the power to protect property and preserve domestic tranquility.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Argued that the proposed Constitution would work in a large republic by fragmenting political power and thus curbing the threat posed by both the wealthy minority and the turbulent majority.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Insisted that the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances would make it difficult for a special interest to dominate the government.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Stressed that the proposed Constitution would create a federal system in which power would be shared between state and federal governments.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE <em>FEDERALIST PAPERS</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay wrote a series of 85 essays now known as the <em>Federalist Papers</em> to defend and explain the Constitution.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_57"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The <em>Federalist Papers</em> are considered a definitive explanation of the theoretical underpinnings of the Constitution. For example, in <em>Federalist No. 10</em>, Madison argued that political factions are undesirable but inevitable. He believed that a large republic with three branches of government would disperse power and thus curb factionalism.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Federalists prevailed as conventions in all thirteen states ratified the Constitution. But many skeptics questioned if the bold and risky decision to transfer sovereignty from the states to the people would work.</p>
