<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE TEXAS REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Texas belonged first to Spain and then, after 1821, to Mexico. The Mexican government opened Texas to settlers from the United States. The Anglo-Americans received generous land grants at low prices. In exchange they agreed to become Roman Catholics and citizens of Mexico. By 1830, there were about 30,000 people in Texas, ninety percent of whom were Anglo-Americans. However, few converted to Catholicism and many owned slaves.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The rapid growth of the Anglo-American population in Texas alarmed Mexican officials. In 1830, the Mexican government announced that slaves could no longer be brought into any part of Mexico and that Americans could no longer settle in Texas. Faced with these restrictions, the Texans rebelled and declared their independence on March 2, 1836.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Texas revolution lasted less than two months. After suffering defeats at the Alamo and Goliad, Texan forces, led by Sam Houston, crushed the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ANNEXATION ISSUE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Most Texans wanted to join the United States. However, antislavery Whigs opposed admitting another slave state into the Union. Other opponents warned that annexing Texas would provoke a war with Mexico.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>President Jackson feared that a prolonged debate over the admission of a slave state would ignite a divisive campaign issue that could cost his chosen successor Martin Van Buren the presidency. As a result, Jackson postponed annexation and Texas remained an independent “Lone Star Republic.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE DOCTRINE OF MANIFEST DESTINY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1820s many Americans thought the boundaries of the United States would not extend beyond the Rocky Mountains. However, the quest for land, opportunity, and adventure excited a new generation eager to explore and settle the western frontier. By 1860, over 4 million people lived west of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>John L. O’Sullivan, the editor of the <em>Democratic Review</em>, gave the nation’s expansionist spirit a name when he coined the term “Manifest Destiny.” O’Sullivan declared that America’s right to territorial expansion lay in “our manifest destiny to occupy and possess the whole of the Continent which Providence has given us.” Illinois Representative John Wentworth expressed this optimistic sense of America’s special destiny when he told Congress that the original States had a divinely sanctioned mission to become the “great center from which civilization, religion, and liberty should radiate and radiate until the whole continent shall bask in their blessings.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>POLK AND MANIFEST DESTINY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The issue of territorial expansion dominated the 1844 presidential election. As the campaign began, Texas still remained independent, California still belonged to Mexico, and America and Great Britain still shared the Oregon Territory.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Democratic presidential nominee James K. Polk shared Jackson’s belief that America was chosen by Providence to be “the guardians of freedom.” Polk narrowly defeated the Whig candidate Henry Clay on a platform promising to turn the idea of Manifest Destiny into a geographical reality.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>TEXAS AND OREGON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Shortly after Polk’s election, Congress approved a resolution annexing Texas as the nation’s 28th state. President Tyler signed the resolution on March 1, 1845, three days before Polk took office.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Acquiring Oregon proved to be more difficult than annexing Texas. Both the United States and Great Britain claimed the territory. The Democratic campaign slogan “Fifty-four forty or fight” meant that the United States would go to war with Britain in order to obtain the entire Oregon territory. Despite his belligerent campaign slogan, Polk avoided a conflict by accepting a proposal dividing Oregon at the 49th parallel.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE OUTBREAK OF WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The annexation of Texas outraged Mexico. Polk exacerbated tensions by supporting Texas’s claim to the Rio Grande River as its southwestern boundary. The Mexican government denied this claim, insisting that the Texas territory extended no further south than the Nueces River.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On April 25, 1846, Mexican cavalry ambushed a U.S. unit in the disputed region between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River, killing 11 soldiers. Polk promptly demanded that Congress declare war on Mexico, stating that Mexico had “invaded our territory and shed American blood on American soil.” Congress agreed and approved a declaration of war on May 13, 1846.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>OPPOSITION TO THE WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Mexican War provoked opposition from a small but highly visible group of influential critics. Whigs such as John Quincy Adams and New England abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison both denounced the war as an act of aggression designed to help the South expand slavery into new territories.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In Congress an obscure Illinois representative named Abraham Lincoln challenged Polk to identify the exact spot on American soil where American blood had been shed. Like other Whigs, Lincoln believed that the skirmish was a pretext for a war to claim new lands.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Henry David Thoreau staged the best-known act of protest against the Mexican War. As a gesture of opposition, the Transcendentalist essayist spent a night in jail for refusing to pay a state poll tax. <span id="page_110"/>Thoreau later wrote the classic essay “Civil Disobedience” urging passive resistance to laws that required a citizen “to be an agent of injustice.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Thoreau’s essay became a source of inspiration for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s philosophy of nonviolent protest. In 1963, authorities in Birmingham, Alabama, arrested the civil rights leader for participating in demonstrations protesting the city’s segregation laws. While in jail, Dr. King wrote his classic essay “Letter from Birmingham Jail” defending civil disobedience as a morally justified response to unjust laws.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>American forces led by Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott successfully conquered Mexico. Taylor became a national hero when he defeated a much larger Mexican army at the Battle of Buena Vista. Scott won public acclaim when his forces captured Mexico City.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>While American forces invaded Mexico, Colonel Stephen W. Kearny captured Santa Fe, New Mexico, and then helped secure California.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Mexico ceded New Mexico and California to the United States while also accepting the Rio Grande as the Texas border. New Mexico included what is now Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The United States acquired more than 500,000 square miles of new territory while Mexico lost about one-third of its territory.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The later Gadsden Purchase was not part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The purchase included land in the southern portion of the New Mexico Territory intended to facilitate the construction of a transcontinental railroad from Houston, Texas, to Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368f"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: NATIONALISM AND SECTIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The War of 1812 sparked a wave of postwar nationalism that supported a new national bank, protective tariff, and a spirit of political harmony during the Era of Good Feelings. The optimism of this Era soon vanished, however, after the Panic of 1819 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820, both of which led to increased feelings of sectionalism.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Mexican War sparked a brief moment of triumph. The war fulfilled the goal of Manifest Destiny by transforming America into a transcontinental republic. Instead of giving rise to a new era of <span id="page_111"/>harmony, however, the postwar spirit of nationalism quickly faded. The Mexican War marked a turning point in American history because it ignited an increasingly bitter dispute over the extension of slavery into the new western territories. Sectionalism soon threatened to disrupt the fragile balance of power between the North and the South.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Since the passage of the Missouri Compromise of 1820, both the Whigs and the Democrats attempted to suppress divisive questions about the status of slavery in the western territories.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On August 8, 1846, David Wilmot, a freshman Democrat from Pennsylvania, attached an amendment, or proviso, to a military appropriations bill. In language deliberately borrowed from the Northwest Ordinance, the proviso stated “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist” in any territory gained from Mexico.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>“THE RIGHT TO RISE”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Wilmot defended his proviso as a necessary means of insuring the “rights of white freemen” to live and work in the new territories without facing the unfair burden of competing with slave labor. He argued that slavery degraded free labor. Wilmot and his supporters believed that “free soil” would guarantee liberty, free competition, social mobility and thus a worker’s “right to rise.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Supported in the North and opposed in the South, the Wilmot Proviso passed the House twice, but was defeated in the Senate.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF THE WILMOT PROVISO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The votes on the Wilmot Proviso did not divide along party lines between Whigs and Democrats. Instead, they occurred between representatives from the North and the South. This rift exposed an ominous development that would soon destroy the Second Party System.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Apprehensive Southern leaders warned that the Wilmot Proviso marked the beginning of a long postponed attack on slavery. Determined to defend their “peculiar institution,” they suppressed dissent in the South and denounced all attempts to resist the expansion of slavery.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_112"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>The South’s response to the Wilmot Proviso deepened Northern fears of the so-called Slave Power. Abolitionists had long warned that a slaveholding oligarchy intended to dominate the federal government. The defeat of the Wilmot Proviso gave these warnings greater credibility.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The debate over the Wilmot Proviso raised issues about slavery, free labor, political power, and the nature of the Constitution that could not be evaded. Despite attempts to resolve them, these issues widened and eventually eroded the bonds holding the Union together.</p>
