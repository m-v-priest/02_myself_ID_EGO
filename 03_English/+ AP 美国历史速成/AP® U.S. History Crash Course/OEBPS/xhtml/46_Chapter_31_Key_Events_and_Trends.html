<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>NAFTA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Clinton was a strong proponent of free trade. He successfully lobbied Congress to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The agreement united the U.S., Mexico, and Canada in a common market without trade barriers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>NAFTA critics warned that free trade would cost American workers their jobs as companies moved factories to Mexico. Once in Mexico, the factories hired inexpensive workers, imported duty-free materials and equipment and then exported finished products back to the United States. American labor leaders vehemently protested, arguing that NAFTA sent 700,000 American jobs to Mexico between 1993 and 2011.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>HEALTH-CARE REFORM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Clinton hoped to extend the nation’s social safety net to the forty million Americans who lacked health insurance.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A task force led by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton produced a 1,300-page plan guaranteeing coverage to every American. Congressional opponents defeated the plan arguing that it was too bureaucratic, complex, and costly.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>WELFARE REFORM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Newt Gingrich, the Republicans regained control of both houses of Congress in 1994. President Clinton recognized the electorate’s increasingly conservative outlook. In a 1996 radio address to the nation, he echoed President Reagan’s opposition to the growth of federal regulations by declaring, “The era of big government is over . . . ”</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_292"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Welfare Reform Bill reflected Clinton’s willingness to work with Republican leaders in Congress. The bill ended the fifty-year federal guarantee of assistance to families with dependent children by making deep cuts in welfare grants and requiring able-bodied welfare recipients to find employment.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>PEACEKEEPING IN BOSNIA AND KOSOVO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Clinton was the first American president since Truman who did not have to face Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Post–Cold War problems in the former Yugoslavia tested American diplomacy. Following the fall of its communist government, Yugoslavia fragmented into ethnically diverse and increasingly hostile regions. Muslims, Croatians, and Serbians in Bosnia fought a bloody civil war. President Clinton ordered American air strikes to prevent the Serbs from continuing their campaign of ethnic cleansing. The air campaign led to a cease-fire followed by a peace agreement secured by American mediation.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The end of the civil war in Bosnia did not prevent violence from continuing in the former Yugoslavia. In 1999, Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević launched a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing to purge Kosovo of its Albanian inhabitants. Responding to global outrage, the United States and its NATO allies launched a successful aerial assault on Serbia. An agreement signed in June 1999 placed Kosovo under UN supervision, with NATO troops acting as peacekeepers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>AN ECONOMIC BOOM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Sparked by the computer and Internet revolutions, the American economy roared to life during the late 1990s. As unemployment fell to 4.8 percent, approval ratings for President Clinton soared to nearly 60 percent.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>America’s booming economy produced surging tax revenues and a budget surplus. Americans confidently looked forward to continued peace and prosperity.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Governor George W. Bush of Texas, the son of the former president, won a razor-thin victory over Vice President Gore <span id="page_293"/>in the 2000 election. Bush promised to be “a compassionate conservative” who would focus on domestic issues such as educational reform.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On Monday, September 10, 2001, air travel in the United States was still relatively stress-free. Passengers could share greetings or goodbyes with friends and families at the boarding gate. Neither the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) nor full-body scanners existed. Very few Americans could identify the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, or Osama bin Laden. All of this and much more would change the next day.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SEPTEMBER 11, 2001</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On the morning of September 11, 2001, nineteen Islamic militant terrorists hijacked four U.S. airliners. The terrorists slammed two planes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and a third into the Pentagon. The fourth plane crashed on a field in southern Pennsylvania after heroic passengers attacked the hijackers. The attacks claimed the lives of almost 3,000 innocent victims and first responders.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The tragic events on 9/11 stunned the country and shaped new realities for America’s foreign policy and domestic life.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR ON TERROR: AFGHANISTAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Bush vowed the United States would “hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts.” Bush did not have to wait long to learn who was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Within a short time, Osama bin Laden released videotapes claiming responsibility on behalf of his terrorist organization Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>President Bush’s promised “war on terrorism” began in Afghanistan where the Taliban regime protected bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda terrorists. In early October 2001, the United States launched a massive military assault, driving the Taliban from power but failing to capture bin Laden.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Despite its auspicious beginning, the war in Afghanistan continued as Taliban and other insurgent groups waged guerrilla war against American forces and the new Afghan government. On May 2, 2011, Navy SEALs killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR ON TERROR: IRAQ</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On January 29, 2002, President Bush gave a State of the Union address identifying Iraq as part of an “axis of evil” that included <span id="page_294"/>Iran and North Korea. The president later claimed that Saddam Hussein had been secretly amassing weapons of mass destruction. After some debate, both houses of Congress voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On March 29, 2003, U.S. forces launched a powerful “shock and awe” air assault that crippled Iraq’s air defenses and command-and-control centers. Less than three weeks later, American-led ground forces marched unopposed into Baghdad as Saddam Hussein fled the capital. The Iraqi dictator was captured 9 months later and executed by hanging on December 30, 2006.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Restoring order and rebuilding Iraq’s shattered economy proved to be far more difficult than the Bush administration anticipated. Within a short time, sectarian violence between Shiite and Sunni Muslims threatened the American goal of creating a stable Iraqi government.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The United States deployed approximately 2 million men and women to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq. The wars in these two countries claimed the lives of more than 6,000 American soldiers and left over 44,000 wounded.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: OUTSPOKEN CRITICS OF AMERICAN WARS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>America has had a long line of outspoken critics who opposed the nation’s wars. For example, Abraham Lincoln and Henry David Thoreau criticized the Mexican-American War, Jane Addams and Mark Twain denounced the annexation of the Philippines, and Senators Wayne Morse and Ernest Gruening voted against the Tonkin Gulf Resolution.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although the public and Congress strongly supported the invasion of Afghanistan, many questioned the wisdom of invading Iraq. West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd warned that while the United States could win a decisive military victory, it would then face a long and costly “second war” to “win the peace in Iraq.” Although Byrd failed to persuade a majority of his colleagues, his prediction proved to be prescient.</p>

<p class="C568"><strong><em>Be prepared for a possible short-answer question asking you to compare and contrast primary source views supporting and opposing the Iraq War</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_295"/>F.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR ON TERROR: IMPACT ON AMERICAN LIFE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act into law on October 26, 2001. Designed to strengthen national security, the law gave the federal government broad powers to combat terrorism by making it easier for law enforcement agencies to search the medical, telephone, financial, and even library records of suspected terrorists. Critics argued that the law’s new security measures often conflicted with America’s traditional respect for civil liberties.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 combined or created over 200 government agencies into a new cabinet-level department. For example, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), National Guard, and Secret Service were now all part of the new department.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Emergency broadcast tests, full-body scans at airports, sleeper cells, and lone-wolf attacks have all become part of the post-9/11 American psyche. Long accustomed to living in a secure homeland, Americans now know that despite their general happiness, the United States is no longer completely safe.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MILESTONES IN THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The computer age began in 1946 at the University of Pennsylvania when scientists demonstrated the computing power of ENIAC—the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. Heralded by the press as a “Giant Brain,” ENIAC contained 17,460 vacuum tubes and filled a large room. It astounded observers by calculating the trajectory of an artillery shell in just 30 seconds, a speed 2,400 times faster than the 20 hours required for human computations. Mainframe computers soon became a common presence in American military bases, universities, and corporate research centers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The personal computer age began in June 1977 when the newly formed Apple Company first marketed its Apple II computer. Four years later, IBM launched its first PC or personal computer. Led by Apple and IBM, the new generation of computers used microprocessors that drastically reduced computer size while enabling users to read, write, and calculate at unprecedented speeds.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Prior to the early 1990s, individual computer operators could not make electronic connections with other users. Introduced during <span id="page_296"/>the mid-1990s, the Internet created a system of interconnected computers allowing individual users to share, seek, and compile information. Today, over 80 percent of Americans and almost 50 percent of the global population have access to an Internet connection.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The smartphone revolution began on January 9, 2007, when Steve Jobs boldly proclaimed, “Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone.” Jobs wasn’t exaggerating. Apple’s new iPhone began a revolution in mobile technology that is still transforming daily life throughout the world.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>GLOBALIZATON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The digital revolution dramatically accelerated the global movement of goods, workers, and investment capital. The process by which the world’s economies are becoming more integrated and interdependent is known as globalization.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Fast-food restaurants provide a widely recognized example of globalization. For example, Subway has 43,985 stores in 112 countries while KFC serves customers in 20,500 locations in 125 countries.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Globalization has fostered a new era of global cooperation and cultural diffusion. For example, in 2014 McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. However, globalization has also intensified worldwide competition for low-cost sources of labor. As a result, 5 million manufacturing jobs have left the United States since 1999. For example, although Nike is headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, it nonetheless contracts with factories in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>INCOME INEQUALITY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In his January 2012 State of the Union message, President Obama argued that a widening gap between the nation’s top income earners and “a growing number of Americans [who] barely get by” poses “the defining issue of our time.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Government statistics document a widening income inequality. Between 1980 and 2012, the share of aggregate income earned by the top 1 percent rose from 8.2 percent to 19.3 percent. During the same time, middle-class incomes stagnated, while the share of aggregate income earned by the lowest fifth fell from 4.2 percent to 3.2 percent.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_297"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>Economists point to a number of possible causes of this expanding income gap. The increasing integration of the United States into the world economy has led to a declining number of high-paying manufacturing jobs. As a result, wages have stagnated for most Americans. In addition, these trends have led to a decline in union membership and thus the ability of unions to negotiate for higher wages.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: THE ROBOTICS REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The robotics revolution began during the 1980s when automobile companies first used industrial robots to automate their assembly lines. The robots performed repetitive and sometimes dangerous tasks with speed and precision. Their use enabled companies to lower costs and pass savings on to consumers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The robotics revolution is now becoming a growing part of our everyday life. For example, ATM machines have transformed the banking experience while voice recognition technology enables travelers to make plane, car, and hotel reservations without the help of a human representative. However, the robotics revolution is also eliminating millions of jobs without providing a safety net for displaced workers.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE “GRAYING” BABY BOOMERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Approximately one-fourth of all Americans are Baby Boomers born between 1946 and 1964. America’s aging boomers are placing increasing pressure on the nation’s health care programs and facilities. The growing number of retirees poses a threat to the long-term viability of Social Security.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Since the 1980s, many older citizens have chosen to retire to Sun Belt states in the South and West. A majority of Americans now live in the Sun Belt, with California, Texas, and Florida now ranking as America’s three most populous states. The region’s surging population growth has given Sun Belt states a greater voice in presidential elections and national political issues.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_298"/>B.</strong></span><strong>THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF THE MILLENNIALS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Millennials comprise a demographic cohort of approximately 80 million people born between 1982 and 2002. In January 2016, the Pew Research Center announced that Millennials had surpassed Baby Boomers to become the nation’s largest living generation.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Millennials are America’s most highly educated, computer literate, and diverse group. Their generally tolerant views on issues ranging from gay marriage to multicultural education are reshaping American life.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SURGING IMMIGRANT POPULATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Immigration trends have always played an important role in American life. The present era is no exception. Between 1990 and 2010, over 20 million immigrants entered the United States, more than in any previous 20-year period.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>America’s foreign-born population has surged from less than 5 percent in 1970 to nearly 13 percent today. The largest number of immigrants are arriving from Latin America and Asia. Immigration policy has emerged as a contentious issue that includes calls for new laws and even a wall along the Mexican border.</p>
