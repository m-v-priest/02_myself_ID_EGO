<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>New France included Canada, the entire Mississippi River Valley and Louisiana. The French thus confined the British colonies to territory east of the Appalachians.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The French and Indian War began as a struggle for control of the upper Ohio River Valley. The war was part of a wider contest between Great Britain and France in Europe known as the Seven Years’ War.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ALBANY PLAN OF UNION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Promoted by Ben Franklin, the Albany Plan of Union called for the formation of a Grand Council of elected delegates that would oversee a common defense against French and Native American threats to frontier settlements.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Franklin’s famous “Join, or Die” cartoon dramatically illustrated the need for greater colonial unity.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The plan failed because colonial assemblies did not want to give up their autonomy. At the same time, the British feared that colonial unity would undermine their authority.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>WAR AND PEACE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Great Britain won because the 1.2 million people in its thirteen colonies outnumbered the 75,000 inhabitants in New France.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Treaty of Paris of 1763 ended French power in North America as Britain took title to Canada, Spanish Florida, and all the French lands east of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT ON NATIVE AMERICANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The French defeat left Native Americans in a vulnerable position by ending long-standing trade and military alliances. Native <span id="page_42"/>Americans could no longer negotiate favorable agreements by playing the French and English against each other.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Confident in their superior military position, the British withheld traditional gifts of guns, powder, and lead. Unwilling to submit to the British, Chief Pontiac turned anti-British animosity into an uprising designed to expel the unwanted Redcoats from Indian lands. The British finally suppressed Pontiac’s warriors at a cost of over 2,000 lives.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Hoping to avoid further conflict with the Native Americans, the British issued the Proclamation of 1763 prohibiting the colonists from settling west of the Appalachians. Land-hungry settlers ignored the Proclamation Line and soon poured into Kentucky.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>TURNING POINTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY: THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The victorious end to the war sparked strong feelings of colonial pride. Having supplied 20,000 soldiers and spent over 2 million pounds, the colonists viewed themselves as important and loyal partners of the British empire.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>While the British leaders also celebrated their glorious victory, the long war left Britain with a great empire and an enormous national debt that had doubled to 130 million pounds.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The looming financial crisis forced Britain’s young and untested King George III and his first minister George Grenville to reassess their colonial policies. Grenville reached a fateful decision when he insisted that the colonies had to begin paying a fair share of the “costs of the empire.”</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>BRITISH ACTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Parliament passed the Stamp Act to raise revenue to help pay for British troops stationed in America.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_43"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Stamp Act required a 1-shilling (about 25 cents) stamp on newspapers and playing cards, a 3-shilling stamp on legal documents, a 2-pound (about 10 dollars) stamp on college diplomas, and a 10-pound (about 50 dollars) stamp on a lawyer’s license.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>COLONIAL REACTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Grenville did not expect opposition to the Stamp Act. He was wrong. Outraged colonial leaders insisted that only their provincial assemblies had the power to raise taxes.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>British leaders responded by arguing that Parliament was based upon a system of virtual representation in which each member of Parliament represented the interests of all Englishmen, including the colonists.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The colonists rejected virtual representation, arguing that as Englishmen they could only be taxed by their own elected representatives. Their defiant slogan, “No taxation without representation” succinctly summarized the colonial position.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The colonists did more than shout slogans. In October 1765, nine colonies sent representatives to a Stamp Act Congress in New York City. This marked the first inter-colonial meeting since the Albany Congress. Unlike the earlier meeting, the Stamp Act Congress drafted a petition to Parliament and called for a boycott of imported British goods.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>PARLIAMENT RESPONDS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Parliament used the doctrine of virtual representation to rebut the colonial petition. But they could not ignore the boycott of British goods as exports fell by 15 percent.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Pressured by angry merchants and their unemployed workers, Parliament rescinded the Stamp Act while also issuing a little-noticed Declaratory Act reasserting their authority over the colonies.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: BOYCOTTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Stamp Act boycott proved to be a masterful tactic that future American protesters would not forget. Almost 200 years later, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led a successful boycott to protest racial segregation on buses in Montgomery, Alabama. The colonists and the Montgomery protesters both successfully used their economic power to sustain a political protest.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_44"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Stamp Act crisis did not galvanize a consensus to declare independence as Americans still remained loyal to King George. However, it did mark the beginning of an increasingly divisive dispute over the relationship between Parliament and the colonies.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>No single event caused the American Revolution. Instead, it was precipitated by the cumulative effect of a series of British actions and colonial reactions.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Before the French and Indian War, John Adams compared the thirteen colonies to “thirteen clocks” each of which kept its own time. However, the once divided colonies began to act in unison as a budget crisis escalated into a fateful dispute that sparked an independence movement.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE TOWNSHEND CRISIS, 1767–1770</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1767, Charles Townshend, the head of the British treasury, persuaded Parliament to enact a new revenue act. The Townshend Act imposed import duties on such everyday items as paint, glass, paper, and tea. Townshend proposed to use the revenue for military expenses to pay the salaries of royal governors and other colonial officials.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Townshend Act reignited the dispute over taxation. The Massachusetts legislature promptly condemned the new taxes and urged other colonial assemblies to join their protest. At the same time, merchants in Boston began a nonimportation movement to boycott British goods.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>American resistance stiffened Townshend’s determination to impose his will on the recalcitrant Bostonians. In late 1768, the first of 4,000 royal troops began to arrive in Boston. Bostonians resented the presence of these troops in their city. On the night of March 5, 1770, a rowdy group of hecklers taunted a squad of British soldiers stationed outside the Boston Customs house. An alarmed soldier fired into the crowd. When the smoke cleared, five townspeople lay on the ground, dead or dying.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Sam Adams, enraged patriots branded the incident the “Boston Massacre.” Paul Revere’s partisan engraving further inflamed colonial opinion by depicting the British soldiers as merciless brutes who killed innocent civilians.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_45"/>5<span class="C344">.</span>On the same day the Boston Massacre occurred, Parliament repealed all the Townshend duties except the one on tea. Although harmony seemed to have been restored, the Townshend Act crisis exacerbated feelings of distrust between British officials and a new, increasingly radical generation of American leaders.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE INTOLERABLE ACTS CRISIS, 1773–1776</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On December 16, 1773, a group of Boston patriots disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded three British ships and threw 342 chests of tea into the harbor.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The so-called Boston Tea Party infuriated British authorities. Parliament promptly passed the Coercive Acts to punish Boston for the wanton destruction of private property.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Known in America as the Intolerable Acts, the legislation closed the port of Boston, sharply curtailed town meetings, and authorized the army to quarter troops wherever they were needed.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Parliament’s punitive actions seemed to confirm the colonists’ fear that Britain intended to restrict each colony’s right to self-government.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The British strategy failed to isolate Boston. In September 1774, fifty-five elected representatives met in Philadelphia to reach a unified colonial response to the Intolerable Acts. The First Continental Congress called for a complete boycott of British goods and urged the colonies to organize militia for defensive purposes.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia in May 1775. The delegates faced an ever-deepening crisis. Bloody battles between colonial militia and British soldiers had just been fought in Lexington and Concord. The Congress responded by creating a Continental Army and naming George Washington its commander.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Despite these aggressive actions, the delegates refused to declare war. Like most colonists, they wavered between acts of resistance and attempts at reconciliation.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE IMPACT OF BRITISH TAXES AND REGULATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Parliament passed the Stamp Act, the Townshend Act, and the Tea Act to raise revenue to help pay for imperial expenses. Instead, <span id="page_46"/>these tax laws raised questions about Parliament’s right to tax the colonies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Parliament passed the Proclamation of 1763, the Quartering Act of 1765, and the Intolerable Acts to tighten its control over the increasingly rebellious colonists. Instead, these regulatory acts intensified the colonists’ resistance to British rule and their commitment to republican values.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF REPUBLICAN VALUES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A belief in republican values inspired the American revolutionaries. Republicanism is the belief that government should be based upon the consent of the governed.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As resistance to British taxes and regulations intensified, colonial leaders became more and more convinced that a republic is preferable to a monarchy because it would establish a small, limited government responsible to the people.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE INFLUENCE OF <em>COMMON SENSE</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In January 1776, Thomas Paine published a pamphlet entitled <em>Common Sense</em> to persuade the colonists to declare their independence from Great Britain.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Paine vigorously defended republican principles while denouncing monarchy as a form of government that produced a constant threat to people’s liberty. Paine assailed George III as an oppressive “royal brute” who should be scorned and not venerated.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Paine rejected calls for a compromise and instead called upon the colonists to declare independence and “begin the world over again.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: THE IMPACT OF BEST-SELLING BOOKS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span><em>Common Sense</em> became an instant bestseller as people throughout the colonies agreed with Paine’s compelling argument for independence.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In the 1850s, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s novel <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> became an instant bestseller convincing many Americans to oppose the Fugitive Slave Law and support abolitionist efforts to end slavery.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_47"/>E.</strong></span><strong>TURNING POINTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY: THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Declaration of Independence marked a momentous turning point in American history. Prior to the declaration, the colonists were still subjects of the British Crown. The Declaration of Independence created a new American identity by transforming a dispute over taxes into a fight for independence.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Jefferson opened the declaration with a concise and compelling statement of principles and self-evident truths. Inspired by John Locke’s philosophy of natural rights, Jefferson asserted that governments derive “their just powers from the consent of the governed.” The governed are entitled to “alter or abolish” their ties to a government that denies them their “unalienable rights” to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Declaration of Independence also marked a turning point in American history because it has had enduring consequences that transcended its initial purpose. Jefferson did not base his argument on the narrow “rights of Englishmen.” Instead, he left a lasting impression on the conscience of the world by appealing to universal principles derived from “the laws of Nature and Nature’s God.” Although not originally fulfilled, Jefferson’s ringing statement that “all men are created equal” became an integral part of the American dream.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Declaration of Independence did not call for the abolition of the slave trade. The reality of slavery thus contradicted Jefferson’s eloquent statement of republican ideals.</p>
