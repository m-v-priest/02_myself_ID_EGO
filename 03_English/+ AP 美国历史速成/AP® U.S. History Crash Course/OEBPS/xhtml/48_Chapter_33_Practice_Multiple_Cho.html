<p class="C467">“For all the calamities that came in the long run, European contact at first offered American Indian peoples many opportunities and advantages. Old World technologies provided a range of trade goods that brought vast improvements to everyday life. . . . What was arguably the greatest contribution, however, was not made of metal but of flesh and blood—the horse. Its effects, especially on western tribes, were truly revolutionary. It altered their material lives, rearranged their relations with their environments, and fed a burst of power and affluence.”</p>

<p class="C467">“We appeal to the country itself. . . . by what cabal . . . the designs of many of those whom we call great men have been transacted and carried on, but let us trace these men in authority and favor to whose hands the dispensation of the country’s wealth has been committed; let us observe the sudden rise of their estates [compared] with the quality in which they first entered this country. . . . Now let us . . . see what sponges have sucked up the public treasure and wither it has not been privately contrived away by unworthy favorites and juggling parasites whose tottering fortunes have been repaired and supported at the public charge. . . .</p>

<p class="C467">“DEAR SIR: I am in receipt of your letter of the 22d of July . . . giving an account of the late barbarous massacre {of six freedmen] at the town of Hamburgh, S.C. . . . The scene at Hamburgh, as cruel, blood-thirsty, wanton, unprovoked, and uncalled for as it was, is only a repetition of the course which has been pursued in other Southern states within the last few years, notably in Mississippi and Louisiana. . . . There has never been a desire on the part of the North to humiliate the South. Nothing is claimed for one State that is not fully accorded to all others, unless it may be the right to kill Negroes and Republicans without fear of punishment and without loss of caste or reputation. . . . I will give every aid for which I can find law or constitutional power. A government that cannot give protection to life, property, and all guaranteed civil right (in this country, the greatest is an untrammeled ballot) to the citizen, is, in so far, a failure, and every energy of the oppressed should be exerted, always <span id="page_310"/>within the law and by constitutional means, to regain lost privileges and protection.”</p>

<p class="C467">“While much is said about moneymaking, not enough is said about efficient, self-sacrificing toil of head and hand. Are not all these things worth striving for? The Niagara Movement proposes to gain these ends. . . . If we expect to gain our rights by nerveless acquiescence in wrong, then we expect to do what no other nation ever did. What must we do then? We must complain. Yes, plain, blunt complain, ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong—this is the ancient, unerring way to liberty, and we must follow it.”</p>

<p class="C337"><strong>ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C353"><strong>1<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(A) The Columbian Exchange refers to the exchange of plants, animals, and diseases between the New World and Europe following the discovery of America in 1492. The excerpt discusses examples of how the Columbian Exchange affected New World peoples.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>2<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(C) Smallpox and other contagious European diseases decimated New World societies. Demographers estimate that the Native American population plummeted by as much as 90 percent in the first century of contact with Europeans.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>3<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(D) Bacon charges that the “men in authority” are “sponges” and “parasites” whose fortunes have been supported by “the public charge.” Tax records from 1650 to 1675 would provide evidence to substantiate Bacon’s charges.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>4<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(B) Bacon’s Rebellion exposed tensions between impoverished former indentured servants and the privileged gentry. As planters became more wary of their former indentured servants, they turned to enslaved Africans as a more reliable and cost-effective source of labor.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>5<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(A) As the leader of a rebellion, Bacon wrote his “Manifesto” to justify his actions and explain his opposition to colonial policies.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>6<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(D) The massacre at Hamburg, South Carolina, and violence in Mississippi and Louisiana provide examples of determined Southern resistance. Grant’s failure to back up his words of <span id="page_319"/>support with forceful actions illustrate the North’s waning resolve. The Supreme Court decision in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> occurred in 1896, two decades after Grant’s letter.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>7<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(C) Radical Republicans would endorse Grant’s condemnation of the violence in South Carolina. Southern Redeemers and Southern Democrats supported the end of Radical Reconstruction. West Coast nativists were focused on the status of Chinese immigrants in California.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>8<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(D) Redeemer governments used poll taxes, literacy tests, and white primaries to disenfranchise African American voters. Loyalty oaths were part of the McCarthy-era Red Scare. They were never used to disenfranchise African American voters.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>9<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(A) Columbia is a poetic alternative name for America. The cartoonist portrays Columbia as a female figure proudly adjusting an Easter bonnet, which is actually a battleship labeled “World Power.” The battleship bonnet is spewing thick black smoke labeled “Expansion.” The cartoonist uses this image to convey his support for America’s growing world power.</p>
<p class="C381"><strong>10<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(D) Created in 1901, the image celebrates America’s victory in the Spanish-American War and the nation’s emergence as a world power.</p>
<p class="C381"><strong>11<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(A) The Treaty of Paris ceded the Philippines to the United States. The agreement aroused a powerful anti-imperialist movement to block ratification. The cartoonist clearly endorsed the treaty. After a heated debate, the Senate approved the Treaty of Paris. The United States was soon forced to use overwhelming military power to crush a Philippine independence movement.</p>
<p class="C381"><strong>12<span class="C344">.</span></strong>(B) Du Bois wrote this essay less than 10 years after the Supreme Court decision in <em>Plessy v.
