<p class="C349"><strong>STRATEGIES FOR THE DOCUMENT-BASED ESSAY QUESTION</strong></p>
<p class="C373">After completing the short-answer questions, you will have a well-deserved 10-minute break. When you return to your desk, your exam will resume with the document-based essay question (DBQ).</p>
<p class="C373">The DBQ is an essay question requiring you to interpret and analyze seven brief primary source documents. The documents are typically excerpts from letters, newspapers, speeches, diaries, official decrees, and even songs. In addition, the DBQ often includes a statistical table, map, political cartoon, or a work of art.</p>
<p class="C373">The College Board recommends that you devote 60 minutes to the DBQ. It typically requires about 15 minutes to read the documents, organize your thoughts, determine a thesis, and create an outline for your essay. You will then have about 45 minutes to write your DBQ essay.</p>
<p class="C373">Your DBQ can earn up to seven rubric points. Each rubric point is worth 5 exam points. So a perfect score of 7 is worth 35 points, or 25 percent of your total exam score. It is important to remember that earning five of the seven possible rubric points will keep you on pace to earn an overall score of 5 on your APUSH exam.</p>
<p class="C337"><strong>THE DBQ SCORING RUBRIC</strong></p>
<p class="C373">The APUSH DBQ scoring rubric is divided into the following four categories:</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>1<span class="C344">.</span>THESIS — 1 POINT</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes your basic argument.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Consists of one or more sentences located in one place; can be written as part of the introduction or the conclusion.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>2<span class="C344">.</span>CONTEXTUALIZATION — 1 POINT</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Describes a broader historic context relevant to the prompt.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Places the prompt in its proper historic setting.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494"><span id="page_330"/>•</span>Connects the prompt to broader historical events or trends occurring before or during the prompt’s time frame.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>3<span class="C344">.</span>EVIDENCE: DOCUMENT CONTENT — 1 OR 2 POINTS</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Uses the content of at least THREE documents to address the topic of the prompt (1 point).</p>
<p class="C495"><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Supports an argument using at least SIX documents. Response must provide an accurate description and not just quotes from the documents (2 points).</p>
<p class="C496"><strong>3<span class="C344">A.</span>EVIDENCE: BEYOND THE DOCUMENTS — 1 POINT</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Uses at least one additional piece of specific and relevant historical evidence beyond what is found in the documents or in the contextualization paragraph.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Explains, supports, or helps prove the thesis argument.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>4<span class="C344">.</span>ANALYSIS AND REASONING: SOURCING — 1 POINT</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Explains the significance of the author’s point of view, the author’s purpose, historic context, or audience for at least THREE of the documents.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Applies just one of these criteria to each document. For example, you can describe the point of view of one document and the intended audience of a second document.</p>
<p class="C496"><strong>4<span class="C344">A.</span>ANALYSIS AND REASONING: COMPLEXITY — 1 POINT</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Demonstrates a <em>complex understanding</em> of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt using evidence to corroborate (reinforce), qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Complex understanding can be accomplished in a variety of ways including:</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>explaining both similarities and differences, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects;</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods;</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes;</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative viewpoints or evidence.</p>
<p class="C337"><strong><span id="page_331"/>A SAMPLE DBQ AND ANNOTATED ESSAY</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Practice is the key to performing well on the DBQ. The following sample DBQ is designed to illustrate how to use a guided set of seven strategies that can be applied to any DBQ.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>1<span class="C344">.</span>BEGIN BY CAREFULLY READING THE ASSIGNMENT.</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Begin by carefully reading the assignment. Here is a sample assignment that asks you to use the historical reasoning process of describing and evaluating patterns of change and continuity over time.</p>
<p class="C373">Analyze major changes and continuities in the lives of African Americans who migrated from the rural South to urban areas in the North during the period 1900 to 1930.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>2<span class="C344">.</span>CAREFULLY EXAMINE EACH OF THE SEVEN DOCUMENTS.</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Your next step is to read, analyze, and organize the following seven documents:</p>
<p class="C373"><strong>Document 1:</strong> Editorial by the editor of the <em>Richmond Times</em>, 1900</p>
<p class="C505">It is necessary that this principle [racial segregation] be applied in every relation of Southern life. God Almighty drew the color line and it cannot be obliterated. The Negro must stay on his side of the line and the white man must stay on his side, and the sooner both races recognize this fact and accept it, the better it will be for both.</p>
<p class="C373"><strong>Document 2:</strong> Southern African American folk saying, 1910s</p>
<div class="C504">
<p class="C373">De white man he got ha’f de crop</p>
<p class="C501">Boll-Weevil took de res’.</p>
<p class="C501">Ain’t got no home,</p>
<p class="C501">Ain’t got no home.</p>
</div>
<p class="C373"><strong>Document 3:</strong> Originally published by the white-owned <em>Athens Daily Banner</em> in Georgia on September 7, 1917. Reprinted by the black-owned <em>Chicago Defender</em> on September 15, 1917, under the headline, “Read This, Then Laugh.”</p>
<p class="C505">Investigation by state and federal officials into the Negro exodus situation has brought to the conclusion that the greatest disturbing element which has yet entered Georgia is the circulation of the Negro newspaper known as <em>The Chicago Defender</em> which has agitated the Negroes to leave the South on the word picture of equality with the whites, the freedom of hotels, theaters and other places of public amusement on an <span id="page_332"/>equal basis with the white people and “equality of citizenship” in the North and East.</p>
<p class="C373"><strong>Document 4:</strong> Dwight Thompson Farnham, Northern white efficiency expert, article titled “Negroes as a Source of Industrial Labor,” Industrial Management, August 1918</p>
<p class="C505">A certain amount of segregation is necessary at times to preserve the peace. This is especially true when Negroes are first introduced into a plant. It is a question if it is not always best to have separate wash rooms and the like. In places where different races necessarily come into close contact and in places where inherited characteristics are especially accentuated, it is better to keep their respective folkways from clashing wherever possible.</p>
<p class="C373"><strong>Document 5:</strong> Lizzie Miles, African American singer, lyrics to the song “Cotton Belt Blues,” 1923</p>
<p class="C505">Look at me. Look at me.</p>
<p class="C507">And you see a gal.</p>
<p class="C507">With a heart bogged down with woe.</p>
<p class="C507">Because I’m all alone,</p>
<p class="C507">Far from my Southern home.</p>
<p class="C507">Dixie Dan. That’s the man.</p>
<p class="C507">Took me from the Land of Cotton</p>
<p class="C507">To that cold, cold minded North.</p>
<p class="C507">Threw me down. Hit the town.</p>
<p class="C507">And I’ve never seen him henceforth.</p>
<p class="C507">Just cause I trusted. I’m broke and disgusted.</p>
<p class="C507">I got the Cotton Belt Blues.</p>

<p class="C373"><strong><span id="page_333"/>Document 7:</strong> Alain LeRoy Locke, <em>The New Negro</em>, 1925</p>
<p class="C505">If we were to offer a symbol of what Harlem has come to mean in the short span of twenty years it would be another statue of liberty on the landward side of New York. It stands for a folk-movement which in human significance can be compared only with the pushing back of the Western frontier in the first half of the last century, or the waves of immigration which have swept in from overseas in the last half. Numerically far smaller than either of these movements, the volume of migration is such nonetheless that Harlem has become the greatest Negro community the world has known—without counterpart in the South or in Africa. But beyond this, Harlem represents the Negro’s latest thrust toward Democracy. . . . In Harlem, Negro life is seizing upon its first chances for group expression and self-determination.</p>

<p class="C353"><strong><span id="page_334"/>4<span class="C344">.</span>WRITE AN OPENING PARAGRAPH THAT ESTABLISHES THE HISTORIC <em>CONTEXT</em> OF THE EVENT.</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Your opening paragraph is an excellent place to establish the historic context for the event specified in your DBQ assignment. Remember that the contextualization point will contribute almost 5 points to your total exam score. Here is a sample introductory paragraph that establishes the context for the Great Migration:</p>
<p class="C510"><em>Between 1900 and 1930, over 1.5 million African Americans migrated from the rural South to urban centers in the North. Known as the Great Migration, this mass movement of people did not occur in isolation. During the same period migrants from American farms and immigrants from villages in Southern and Eastern Europe also poured into Northern cities. By 1920, the federal census reported that for the first time a majority of Americans lived in urban areas</em>.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>5<span class="C344">.</span>WRITE A THESIS STATEMENT THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES YOUR DBQ ASSIGNMENT.</strong></p>
<p class="C373">A thesis is your position or historic claim about the assigned topic. Having a clearly defined and focused thesis is absolutely essential. Your organizational chart reveals that African Americans experienced BOTH continuity and change during the Great Migration. Your thesis should acknowledge the existence of these two historical processes. However, your job is not to be a neutral observer. Which process—continuity or change—was the most important? There is evidence to support both processes. Your job is to make a JUDGMENT and incorporate that judgment into your thesis. Note how the following sample thesis acknowledges the importance of continuity but concludes that changes played the most significant role in the lives of African Americans who migrated to the North.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>The Great Migration produced both significant changes and continuities in the social and economic experience of African Americans living in the urban areas in the North. Although the migrants continued to experience poverty, discrimination, and segregation, these conditions were not as rigid as those in the Jim Crow South. At the same time, the Great Migration produced changes in Black identity and aspirations that left an irrevocable mark on the African American experience</em>.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong><span id="page_335"/>6<span class="C344">.</span>CAREFULLY DEVELOP YOUR THESIS IN A SERIES OF BODY PARAGRAPHS.</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Now that you have written a strong thesis, your next step is to develop it in a series of body paragraphs. These vital paragraphs are where you can earn 4 additional rubric points by analyzing the content of at least 6 documents, evaluating the purpose, point of view, audience, or historic setting of at least 3 documents, and providing evidence beyond the documents to further develop your argument.</p>
<p class="C373">Our sample DBQ provides clear sourcing material for Documents 3, 4, and 7. The short but important paragraph on the Harlem Renaissance provides specific and relevant information that is not found in the seven documents.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>Documents 1 and 2 describe the “push” factors that explain why many African Americans wanted to leave the South. About 90 percent of African Americans lived in the South in 1900. Most were concentrated in rural areas where they worked as sharecroppers on cotton farms. Sharecropping forced African Americans into a cycle of poverty and debt in which “De white man he got ha’f the crop” (Doc. 2). At that same time an infestation of boll weevils swept across the Deep South devastating the cotton industry (Doc. 2). Jim Crow laws sanctioned by the</em> Plessy v. Ferguson <em>“separate but equal” decision created a rigid “color line” that white supremacists insisted could not be “obliterated” (Doc. 1). Racial violence that included lynchings terrorized black communities</em>.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>Document 3 provides a persuasive explanation of the “pull” factors that prompted many African Americans to seek better lives outside the South. First published in a white-owned newspaper in Athens, Georgia,</em> The Chicago Defender <em>gleefully reprinted the article. The black-owned newspaper played an important role in condemning Jim Crow laws and in encouraging African Americans to migrate to Chicago and to other Northern cities. The article from the</em> Athens Daily Banner <em>unintentionally substantiated</em> The Defender’s <em>numerous articles describing Chicago as an attractive destination offering good jobs, public entertainment, a chance for economic success, and most of all “equality in citizenship.”</em></p>
<p class="C510"><em>African Americans did find new jobs in the North. But the “equality with whites” promised by</em> The Chicago Defender <em>proved to be elusive. In Document 4, a Northern white efficiency expert offers his fellow industrial managers advice on how “to preserve the peace” between white and African American workers. According to his matter-of-fact report, prudent managers should “create separate wash rooms” and other segregated facilities</em>.</p>
<p class="C505"><em><span id="page_336"/>This policy would, he believes, help employees avoid unwanted cultural clashes. Although not as systematic as Jim Crow segregation, this “certain amount of segregation” represents an important example of continuity in the social and economic experience of African Americans in Northern cities</em>.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>The problems experienced by African American migrants were not limited to workplace discrimination. The optimism encouraged by</em> The Chicago Defender <em>soon encountered the harsh realities of trying to establish a new life in the North. The lyrics of the song “Cotton Belt Blues” (Doc. 5) express the disillusionment felt by many African Americans who left “the land of cotton” only to become “broke and disgusted” in crowded and callous cities. Document 5 thus provides lyrics that corroborate the same economic plight expressed by the African American folk saying in Document 2</em>.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>Job discrimination and economic setbacks did not deter African Americans from leaving the South. Document 6 provides statistical data documenting the percentage growth of African Americans in six major cities. The chart reveals that the promise of war-related jobs and the possibility of escaping Jim Crow segregation caused a surge in black migration between 1910 and 1920. The end of World War I did not stop the Great Migration. Instead, it accelerated during the 1920s as the black population of Northern cities continued to increase (Doc. 6)</em>.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>New York City proved to be a particularly important destination. (Doc. 6). Harlem is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. During the 1920s, Harlem became the vibrant center of an outpouring of African American literary, artistic, and political expression known as the Harlem Renaissance</em>.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>In Document 7, Alain LeRoy Locke equates the symbolic importance of Harlem to “another statue of liberty.” He proudly describes Harlem as “the greatest Negro community the world has known.” Harlem’s greatness is not based upon its size; it is based upon its importance as the creative nerve center of the “Negro’s latest thrust toward democracy.” Locke’s emphasis upon “group expression and self-determination” reinforce the message of equality in Document 3</em>.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong><span id="page_337"/>7<span class="C344">.</span>WRITE A CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH THAT RESTATES YOUR THESIS AND DEMONSTRATES COMPLEXITY.</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Now that you have written a convincing series of analytical body paragraphs, your final task is to write a succinct paragraph restating your thesis. Here is a sample concluding paragraph:</p>
<p class="C510"><em>The Great Migration produced far-reaching changes in the African American experience. When the migration began in 1900, African Americans lived impoverished lives as sharecroppers in the rural South (Doc. 2). When it ended in 1930, African Americans were rapidly becoming an urbanized population (Doc. 6) that escaped the worst abuses of racial segregation in the South. Although poverty and some forms of discrimination continued in the North, African American migrants who left “the land of cotton” proudly crossed the “color line” (Doc. 1) by asserting a more confident identity as “New Negroes.”</em></p>
