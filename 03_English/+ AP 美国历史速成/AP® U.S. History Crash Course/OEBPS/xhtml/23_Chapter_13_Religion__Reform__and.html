</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The religious fervor ignited by the First Great Awakening declined as colonial rebellion led to revolution and the eventual ratification and inauguration of the new Constitution dominated American public life.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the early 1800s, a new wave of intense religious feeling called the Second Great Awakening swept across much of the country. Thousands of people attended emotionally charged camp meetings featuring appeals to faith and conversion by charismatic preachers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>“MORAL FREE AGENTS”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Devout Puritans accepted the Calvinist belief that original sin doomed humanity to a predestined membership in either a small group of “the elect” or a much larger mass of “the damned.” In contrast, Second Great Awakening preachers such as Charles Grandison Finney emphasized that each individual was a “moral free agent” who could chart his or her own spiritual course in life.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Second Great Awakening freed Protestants from the Calvinist doctrine of humanity’s innate depravity. Instead, a merciful and loving God granted people free will and therefore the freedom to do good. The Second Great Awakening inspired a belief in perfectionism—faith in the human ability to consciously build a just society.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE BURNED-OVER DISTRICT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Central and western New York became known as the “Burned-Over District” because of the particularly fervent revivals that crisscrossed the region.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_98"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Burned-Over District was the birthplace of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or the Mormons. Joseph Smith provided the initial leadership that galvanized this new faith.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>IMPORTANCE OF THE SECOND GREAT AWAKENING</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Second Great Awakening was a predominantly Christian movement that altered the religious landscape of America. The Congregationalists in New England and the Anglicans in Virginia dominated religious life in colonial America. During the Second Great Awakening these faiths receded. Energized by passionate itinerant ministers, membership in the Baptist and Methodist churches surged.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Second Great Awakening witnessed the birth of a distinctive black church in America. Most enslaved Africans gravitated to the Baptist and Methodist faiths. By the middle of the nineteenth century, white and black Baptist and Methodist denominations constituted two-thirds of the Protestant ministers and churches in America.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Second Great Awakening inspired converts to believe in the possibility of improving their own lives and addressing social problems. It was a short step from the Second Great Awakening’s emphasis upon spiritual progress to a belief in social progress. For example, a convert who pledged to give up alcohol could then be persuaded to work for temperance in his or her community.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The optimistic belief that Christians have an obligation to improve their society generated a number of reform movements. Denied roles in politics and the new market economy, many women found that they could make a difference by championing social change. Reformers worked to improve public education, promote better care for the mentally ill, limit the sale of alcoholic beverages, abolish slavery, and expand women’s rights.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The Second Great Awakening played an important role in the ongoing democratization of public life in the early republic. The involvement of Protestants in their churches paralleled the increasing involvement of citizens in their government. Jacksonian democracy and the Second Great Awakening both expressed and reinforced the spirit of egalitarianism shaping American culture.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>EDUCATIONAL REFORM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Horace Mann sponsored many reforms in Massachusetts including a longer school year, higher pay for teachers, and a larger public <span id="page_99"/>school system. As a result of his tireless work, Mann is often called the “Father of the Common School Movement.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Emma Willard was an early advocate of women’s education. She founded Troy Female Seminary, America’s first woman’s school of higher education.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>America’s public school children learned about literature from a series of textbooks called <em>McGuffey Readers</em>. Also known as <em>Eclectic Readers</em>, the books featured stories illustrating the virtues of patriotism, hard work, and honesty.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE MENTALLY ILL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Dorothea Dix launched a crusade to create special hospitals for the mentally ill. An indefatigable champion of reform, Dix travelled more than 10,000 miles and visited almost every state.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Dix and other reformers created the first generation of American mental asylums. By the 1850s there were special hospitals in 28 states.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the early 1800s, America had over 14,000 distilleries producing 25 million gallons of alcoholic beverages each year. By 1830, Americans drank 5 gallons of alcohol per capita.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The temperance movement was a widespread campaign to convince Americans to consume less alcohol. Founded in 1826, the American Society for the Promotion of Temperance soon boasted 5,000 state and local temperance groups. Their campaign against “Demon Rum” worked. By the mid-1840s, Americans drank just 2 gallons of alcohol per capita.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: REFORM MOVEMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Antebellum reform featured a number of voluntary organizations. Inspired by the Second Great Awakening, many reformers strove to eradicate sin from American society.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The reform impulse did not vanish from American life. Populists, Progressives, New Dealers, and advocates of the Great Society all sponsored programs designed to address social problems. For example, the Progressives focused on a broad range of problems including the consequences of industrialization, urbanization, and immigration. While the antebellum reformers emphasized voluntary reform organizations, the Progressives wanted government to play an active role in solving social problems and improving the quality of American life.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE AMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Founded in 1817, the American Colonization Society (ACS) advocated the gradual abolition of slavery combined with the goal of returning freed slaves to Africa. Although ACS members opposed slavery, many were openly racist and believed that blacks could not be integrated into American society.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The ACS was instrumental in founding the colony of Liberia on the west coast of Africa. However, the Society’s gradual approach could never resolve the problem of slavery. By 1860, the ACS helped approximately 12,000 freed blacks migrate to Liberia. At that time there were about 4 million slaves in the South.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON: “I WILL BE HEARD”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>William Lloyd Garrison was a mild-looking reformer who at first supported the ACS’s gradual approach to ending slavery. But Garrison’s youthful appearance belied his strong moral convictions. His contact with slavery in Baltimore transformed him into a radical abolitionist who believed that slavery was a cruel, brutal, and sinful institution that should be immediately abolished.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As Garrison’s views became more militant, he resolved to move to Boston and begin his own antislavery newspaper, <em>The Liberator</em>. On New Year’s Day 1831, the 26-year-old Garrison published an open letter rejecting moderation and compromise. He boldly denounced slave owners as oppressors who defended an immoral institution that contradicted the Declaration of Independence’s self-evident truth that all men are created equal.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Garrison defiantly promised, “I will not retreat a single inch–AND I WILL BE HEARD!” Although <em>The Liberator</em> had a modest circulation, Garrison’s uncompromising call for immediate and uncompensated emancipation helped galvanize anti-slavery sentiment in the Northeast. In 1833, Garrison co-founded the American Anti-Slavery Society. Within just five years, it claimed to have 250,000 members and 1,350 local affiliates.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>FREDERICK DOUGLASS: “I STOLE THIS HEAD”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Born a slave in Maryland, Frederick Douglass escaped from bondage in 1838 when he was just twenty-one. Recruited by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass became a gifted orator who captivated anti-slavery audiences with his authentic stories about the horrors of slavery. For example, he told a spellbound audience <span id="page_101"/>in Massachusetts, “I appear before this immense assembly this evening as a thief and a robber. I stole this head, these limbs, this body from my master and ran off with them.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Douglass was also a compelling writer. In 1845 he published his <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em> describing his brutal fight with a slave driver and dramatic escape to the North. In 1847, he founded the <em>North Star</em>, an influential anti-slavery newspaper.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Douglass’s eloquent speeches and writings played an important role in persuading a growing number of Northerners that slavery was evil and that its further spread into the western lands should be halted.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The new American republic promoted equality and political democracy. However, women could not vote, hold office, or serve on juries. In addition, married women were denied rights to own and manage property, to form contracts, and to exercise legal control over children.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Prior to the Industrial Revolution many men and women worked together as an economic unit on small family farms. As the Industrial Revolution gained momentum, it encouraged a division of labor between home and work. While men held jobs in a competitive market economy, the home became the appropriate place or “sphere” for a woman.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE CULT OF DOMESTICITY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The cult of domesticity idealized women in their roles as wives and mothers. As a nurturing mother and faithful spouse, the wife created a home that was a “haven in a heartless world.” The home thus became a refuge from the world rather than a productive economic unit.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_102"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The cult of domesticity created a cultural ideal that best applied to upper- and middle-class white families that could afford to maintain separate spheres for their work life and for their home life. There was a wide gap between the ideals of the cult of domesticity and the harsh realities faced by women working in factories and on the frontier. Enslaved black women were completely excluded from any hope of participating in the cult of domesticity.</p>
<div class="C565"><p class="C564"><img alt="" src="../img/30_1.jpg"/></p></div>
<p class="C568"><strong><em>APUSH test writers often use pictures to see if students can identify and explain the concept of the cult of domesticity. The pictures typically feature a middle-class mother surrounded by her children. Her husband stands to the side watching as his wife instructs their children in music and literature</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SENECA FALLS CONVENTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1830s and 1840s many women dedicated themselves to working for the abolition of slavery. Led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, a small but determined group of feminists realized that they were also the victims of injustice. The anti-slavery movement thus helped spark a demand for equal rights for women.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Stanton and Mott issued a call for a convention to meet in Seneca Falls, New York, “to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of women.” On July 19, 1848, approximately 300 delegates, including Frederick Douglass, met inside the Wesleyan Chapel to conduct America’s first convention devoted to women’s rights.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>After meeting for two days, the convention issued a “Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions.” Written primarily by Stanton, the Declaration opened by declaring, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The convention unanimously passed resolutions calling for greater divorce and child custody rights, equal opportunities in education, and the right to retain property after marriage. However, a contentious debate erupted over a controversial resolution calling for the extension of the suffrage to women. Douglass made a key speech emphasizing that the right to participate in government is a fundamental principle of equality, from which all other rights would follow. His speech swayed the delegates and the Stanton-Douglass position narrowly prevailed.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_103"/>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: FEMINISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Seneca Falls Convention marked the beginning of the women’s rights movement in the United States. The resolutions passed at Seneca Falls formed the agenda for what historians call first-wave feminism. The first-wave agenda was fulfilled in 1920 when Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment granting women the right to vote.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A second wave of feminism began in the United States in the early 1960s. Sparked by Betty Friedan’s book <em>The Feminist Mystique</em>, the revived feminist movement focused on a new range of issues including workplace discrimination, domestic violence, and reproductive rights.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>FROM DEISM TO ROMANTICISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and many other leading late eighteenth century American intellectuals were Deists. “Deism” is the belief that God created the world but then allowed it to operate through the laws of nature. These natural laws could be discovered by human reason and expressed in mathematical formulas.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1820s and ’30s, artists and writers in Europe and America began to rebel against Deism’s logical and well-ordered world. “Feeling is all!” became the guiding spirit of a new generation of Romantic painters and poets. The Romantic Movement’s emphasis upon emotion reinforced the Second Great Awakening’s emphasis upon the intense expression of spiritual feelings.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>TRANSCENDENTALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Transcendentalists were a small but influential group of writers and thinkers who lived in and around Boston. The leading Transcendentalists included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller (a brilliant woman who died at an early age in a shipwreck).</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Transcendentalists believed that God lived within each individual. Each person possessed an inner soul or spirit and thus a capacity to find spiritual truth.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_104"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>The Transcendentalists believed that truth could be found in nature. They viewed communion with nature as a religious experience that enlightened their souls. For example, Thoreau turned away from the artificiality of “civilized” life and lived for two years in a cabin at the edge of Walden Pond near Concord.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Hudson River School was America’s first native school of art. Its members concentrated on painting landscapes that portrayed America’s natural beauty.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>For two famous examples of Hudson River School art, see <em>The Oxbow</em> by Thomas Cole and <em>The Rocky Mountains, Lander’s Peak</em> by Albert Bierstadt.</p>
