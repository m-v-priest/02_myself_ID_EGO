<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ARRIVAL AND DISPERSAL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The earliest North American residents crossed a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Following large game animals, these Asian immigrants gradually spread through North and South America, reaching the tip of South America by 9000 <code>BCE</code>.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NORTH AMERICAN CULTURAL REGIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Pacific Northwest</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The abundant natural resources of the Pacific Northwest supported a relatively dense population. Rivers teemed with salmon and other fish providing an easily available source of nutritious food. The thick forests provided wood for housing and boats.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Tribes such as the Haida collected shellfish from the beaches and hunted the ocean for whales, sea otters, and seals.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>The Kwakiutl celebrated their abundance by carving magnificent totems that included symbols of ancestral spirits.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Desert Southwest</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The Southwest challenged Native Americans with a much drier climate than that of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>The Pueblo built settlements near the Rio Grande and its tributaries. The Hopi lived near cliffs that could be easily defended. They collected rainwater in rock cisterns and carefully parceled it out to their fields and to families living in clusters of houses called pueblos.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>People throughout the region lived in multi-story houses made of adobe. They coaxed crops of maize (corn), beans, melons, and squash from sun-parched, but fertile, soil.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_20"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>The Great Plains</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The Great Plains are flat open grasslands extending from the Rockies to the Mississippi River. Hot, dry summers followed cold, snowy winters. Huge buffalo herds roamed across the vast grasslands.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>The Pawnee planted corn, squash, and beans. Once the plants were strong enough to survive, the entire tribe packed up for the spring buffalo hunt. While on the hunt, the Pawnee lived in portable houses made of buffalo skin called tepees.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Eastern Woodlands</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Hardwood forests dominated the land stretching from the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River in the north to the Gulf of Mexico in the south. It was said that a squirrel could travel from Tennessee to New York without ever touching the ground.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Tribes such as the Creek, Choctaw, and Powhatan cleared the forest and built villages. They blended hunting and gathering with agriculture based upon the cultivation of maize, squash, and beans.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>John White created a detailed engraving of Secotan, an Algonquian village on the Pamlico River in present-day North Carolina. White depicted a complex society living in a permanent agricultural settlement. The villagers devoted two fields to tobacco but saw no need to construct a defensive fence.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Common Characteristics</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The early peoples of North America lived in families that were part of larger clans. They lived in village communities, divided labor by gender, and shared a strong sense of spirituality.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>The early peoples did not develop wheeled vehicles, waterwheels, or a tradition of private property rights. Native Americans viewed land and water as communal possessions that could not be owned or traded.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Columbian Exchange refers to the exchange of plants, animals, and germs between the New World and Europe following the discovery of America in 1492.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>New World crops included maize (corn), tomatoes, and potatoes. In addition, New World mines provided a steady supply of gold and silver. For example, the fabulously rich Potosi mines (in modern-day Bolivia) produced 200 tons of silver a year for two centuries.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Old World crops included wheat, sugar, rice, and coffee. In addition, Europeans introduced horses, cows, chickens, and pigs into the New World.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT ON EUROPE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>New World foods transformed European society by increasing agricultural yields and improving diets, thus stimulating population growth.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_22"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Columbian Exchange generated a profitable trans-Atlantic trade that helped spark European economic development by facilitating the shift from feudalism to capitalism.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT ON NATIVE AMERICANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Old World diseases decimated the Native American population. Demographers estimate that the Native American population plummeted by 90 percent or more in the first century of contact with Europe.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This demographic collapse enabled the Spanish to more easily gain control over Native American lands.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Spanish established a New World empire in order to spread their Roman Catholic faith and extend the king’s wealth and power.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Spain created a rigid and highly centralized New World government controlled by the crown in Madrid.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE <em>ENCOMIENDA</em> SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>An <em>encomienda</em> was a license granted by the Spanish crown to royal officials to extract labor and tribute from native peoples living in specified areas. For example, Cortés appropriated tribute from 23,000 families in the fertile Oaxaca Valley.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The <em>encomienda</em> system began in the Caribbean and then spread to Mexico. It enabled Spanish colonial administrators to marshal native labor to support plantation-based agriculture and extract precious metals. In exchange, the <em>encomenderos</em> were responsible for Christianizing the native peoples under their protection.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Although the native peoples were legally not slaves, ruthless <em>encomenderos</em> nevertheless created an often brutal system of forced labor that led to many abuses.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The inhumanity of the system appalled Dominican priest Bartolomé de las Casas. He renounced his <em>encomienda</em> and became an eloquent critic of how the Spanish mistreated the native peoples.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_23"/>C.</strong></span><strong>A NEW SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As disease and warfare reduced their numbers, the native population could not meet the Spaniards’ growing demand for a large body of captive laborers. By the early 1500s, the Spanish began to import enslaved Africans to labor on sugar plantations and in the silver mines.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>About 300,000 enslaved Africans arrived in New Spain between 1500 and 1650. At the same time, at least 350,000 Spaniards migrated to the Caribbean, Mexico, and the Andes.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Males comprised the majority of Spanish migrants. As a result, intermarriage produced a diverse mixture of Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans. Those who ruled in New Spain often followed the advice of Machiavelli, who insisted that successful rulers must be ruthless and pragmatic, always remembering that the end justifies the means.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Spanish attempted to enforce an elaborate racial hierarchy with themselves at the top and natives on the bottom. Mestizos (Spaniard-Indian) and Mulattos (Spaniard-African) fell in between. The Spanish justified this stratified society as proof of the higher level of civilization among Europeans. Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, a Spanish nobleman, used this same justification when he engaged in a famous debate with Bartolomé de las Casas in the 1550s over the proper treatment of Native Americans.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the seventeenth century the Spanish gradually gained control over the Pueblo people living in what is today New Mexico.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Spanish disrupted the Pueblos’ traditional culture by forcing them to labor on <em>encomiendas</em> and worship in Catholic missions.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>POPÉ</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Popé was a determined and dynamic Pueblo leader who deeply resented the Spanish. His message was simple—expel the Spanish and return to the old ways of life that had given the Pueblo peace, prosperity, and independence.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Popé, the Pueblo rose in revolt in 1680. They soon killed hundreds of Spaniards while destroying their buildings and burning their fields.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_24"/>C.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The uprising did not bring peace and prosperity to the Pueblo. Following Popé’s death in 1688, the Spanish launched a successful reconquest of the Pueblo.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>When the Spanish returned, they adopted a policy of greater cultural accommodation. They no longer tried to eradicate the Pueblo culture. Over the next century, New Mexico became a blend of Spanish and Pueblo cultures.</p>
