<p class="C349"><strong><span id="id_1">SEVEN</span> KEYS FOR SUCCESS ON THE AP® U.S. HISTORY EXAM</strong></p>
<p class="C373">AP<strong>®</strong> American History textbooks are very thick and contain thousands of names, dates, places, and events. If all of these facts had an equal chance of appearing on your Advanced Placement<strong>®</strong> United States History (APUSH) exam, studying would be a nightmare. Where would you begin? What would you emphasize? Is there any information you can safely omit? Or must you study everything?</p>
<p class="C373">Fortunately, preparing for the APUSH exam does not have to be a nightmare. By studying efficiently and strategically, you can score a 4 or a 5 on the exam. This book will help you understand and use the following seven keys for success:</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>1<span class="C344">.</span>Understanding the APUSH Scale</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Many students believe they must make close to a perfect score to receive a 5. Nothing could be further from the truth. Each APUSH exam contains a total of 140 points—55 from the multiple-choice and 85 from the free-response questions. Here is the score range for the 2018 APUSH exam:</p>

<p class="C373">This chart is not a misprint. As is clearly shown, you can achieve a 5 by correctly answering just 77 percent of the questions, a 4 by correctly answering just 65 percent of the questions, and a 3 by correctly answering just 52 percent of the questions!</p>

<p class="C373">APUSH test writers follow a detailed Course and Exam Description (CED) that divides American history into the following nine distinct periods of time:</p>
<div class="C504">
<table cellpadding="0px" cellspacing="0px" class="C542">
<tr class="T319_FirstRow"><td class="C545"><strong>PERIOD</strong></td>

<p class="C353"><strong>3<span class="C344">.</span>Understanding the APUSH Topical Themes</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Many students believe that members of the APUSH exam development committee have the freedom to write any question they wish. This wide-spread belief is not true. APUSH test writers follow the Course and Exam Description based upon the following 8 themes or broad ideas that run throughout the course:</p>
<div class="C365">
<p class="C345"><strong>THEME 1:</strong> American and National Identity</p>
<p class="C345"><strong>THEME 2:</strong> Work, Exchange, and Technology</p>
<p class="C345"><strong>THEME 3:</strong> Geography and the Environment</p>
<p class="C345"><strong>THEME 4:</strong> Migration and Settlement</p>
<p class="C345"><strong>THEME 5:</strong> Politics and Power</p>
<p class="C345">T<strong>HEME 6:</strong> America in the World</p>
<p class="C345"><strong>THEME 7:</strong> American and Regional Culture</p>
<p class="C345"><strong>THEME 8:</strong> Social Structures</p>
</div>
<p class="C373"><span id="page_3"/>These eight themes explain why there are so many questions on immigration trends, economic policies, cultural movements, and the influence of geographic conditions.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>4<span class="C344">.</span>Understanding the APUSH Exam Format</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Your APUSH exam will include four very different question formats. Here are the key facts about each of these formats:</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>You will be asked to answer 55 multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The 55 questions will be grouped into sets containing between 2 and 4 questions. Each set of questions will be based upon a stimulus prompt. The prompts will be a brief source that could be a reading passage, a chart or graph, an illustration, or a map.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Each of the 55 questions will be worth 1 point for a total of 55 points. The multiple-choice questions will count for 40 percent of your total score.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>You will be given 55 minutes to complete the multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>See <a href="47_TEST_TAKING_STRATEGIES_AND_PRACT.html#page_299">Chapter 32</a> for detailed strategies for answering multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>See <a href="48_Chapter_33_Practice_Multiple_Cho.html#page_307">Chapter 33</a> to sample realistic multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>You will be asked to answer 3 short-answer questions.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The first short-answer question will feature dueling opinions of two historians or contemporary writers. The second short-answer question will ask you to analyze a political cartoon or a historic image. The final two short-answer questions will ask you to compare important historical trends, patterns, and movements. You will only have to answer one of these two questions.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Each short-answer question will include three very specific sub-points. Your answers to these sub-points do not require a thesis. Concentrate on writing concise statements that include specific historic examples. Use complete sentences—an outline or list of bulleted points is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_4"/>4<span class="C344">.</span>Each sub-point is worth 3.1 exam points. As a result, a full short-answer question is worth 9.3 exam points. Taken together, the three short-answer questions are worth a total of 28 points, or 20 percent of your total exam score.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>You will be given 40 minutes to complete the three short-answer questions.</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>See <a href="49_Chapter_34_Strategies_for_the_Sh.html#page_323">Chapter 34</a> for detailed strategies for answering short-answer questions.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTION (DBQ)</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The DBQ is an essay question that requires you to interpret and analyze 7 brief primary source documents. The documents typically include excerpts from diaries, speeches, letters, reports, and official decrees. In addition, DBQs often include at least one graph, chart, map, or political cartoon.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The College Board recommends that you devote 60 minutes to planning and writing your DBQ.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Your DBQ will be scored on a rubric that includes 7 specific points. Each rubric point is worth 5 exam points. Taken together, the DBQ is worth a maximum of 35 points, or 25 percent of your exam score.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>See <a href="50_Chapter_35_Strategies_for_the_Do.html#page_329">Chapter 35</a> for detailed strategies for answering the DBQ question.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>LONG-ESSAY QUESTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>You will be given three long-essay questions. Although the three questions will be taken from different time periods, they will be related by a common theme and historical thinking skill. You will be asked to select and write about just <strong><em>one</em></strong> of the three long-essay questions.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>You will be given 40 minutes to write your essay.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Your essay will be scored on a rubric that includes six specific points. Each rubric point is worth 3.5 exam points. Taken together the long-essay question is worth 21 points, or 15 percent of your total exam score.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>See <a href="51_Chapter_36_Strategies_for_the_Lo.html#page_339">Chapter 36</a> for detailed strategies for answering the long-essay question.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong><span id="page_5"/>5<span class="C344">.</span>Understanding the Meaning and Uses of Seven Historical Thinking Skills</strong></p>
<p class="C373">The APUSH course stresses the understanding and use of seven key historical thinking skills. It is very important that you understand the meaning of each skill and the role it plays on the exam.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>HISTORICAL CAUSATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>This skill involves the ability to identify and evaluate the long and short-term causes and consequences of a historical event, development or process.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the multiple-choice, short-answer, and long-essay questions.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>PATTERNS OF CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>This skill involves the ability to recognize, analyze, and evaluate the dynamics of historical continuity and change over periods of time of varying length. It also involves the ability to connect these patterns to larger historical processes or themes.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the DBQ and long-essay questions.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>COMPARISON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>This skill involves the ability to identify, compare, and evaluate multiple perspectives on a given historical event, development, or process.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the DBQ and long-essay questions.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXTUALIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>This skill involves the ability to connect historical events and processes to specific circumstances of time and place as well as to broader regional, national, and global processes occurring at the same time.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the multiple-choice questions. It also generates a specific point in both the DBQ and long-essay rubrics.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_6"/>E.</strong></span><strong>HISTORICAL ARGUMENTATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>This skill involves the ability to create an argument and support it using relevant historical ideas.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in both the DBQ and the long-essay questions. The rubrics in both of these questions award points for developing and supporting a defensible thesis.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>ANALYZING EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>This skill involves the ability to analyze features of historical evidence such as audience, purpose, point of view, and historical context. It also involves the ability to demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development by using evidence to corroborate or qualify an argument.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This skill plays a particularly significant role in both the DBQ and the long-essay questions. The DBQ rubric awards up to 5 points for using and analyzing evidence while the long-essay rubric awards up to 4 points for these skills.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>G.</strong></span><strong>INTERPRETATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>This skill involves the ability to describe, analyze, and evaluate the different ways historians interpret the past.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the short-answer questions and DBQ.</p>

<p class="C373">If you have the time, review the entire book. This is desirable, but not mandatory. The chapters can be studied in any order. Each chapter provides you with a digest of key information that is repeatedly tested. Battles, inventions, rulers, and political events that have never been asked about on the APUSH exam have been omitted. Unlike most review books, the digests are not meant to be exhaustive. Instead, they are meant to focus your attention on the vital material you must study. <span id="page_7"/>Many of the chapters in this book have a special feature called “Making Comparisons.” This feature is designed to provide you with in-depth discussions of key topics. The Making Comparison feature will help you develop the historical thinking skills of making comparisons and interpreting events.</p>
<p class="C373">In addition, many of the chapters contain sections devoted to “Turning Points in American History.” This material is designed to help you prepare for DBQ and long-essay questions devoted to causation. All of the chapters contain at least one “Making Connections” section. The topics in these sections are designed to provide you with an inventory of examples you can use to demonstrate complexity in your DBQ and long-essay answers.</p>
