<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CAUSES OF THE POPULIST REVOLT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The laws of supply and demand worked against American farmers. The more wheat, corn, and cotton they produced, the lower prices fell. For example, the price of a bushel of wheat plummeted from $1.19 in 1881 to just 49 cents in 1894.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Angry farmers blamed the railroads for many of their problems. Most farmers depended upon the railroads to transport their crops to urban markets and then return with heavy machinery. Farmers bitterly complained that the railroads used their monopoly power to charge unfair rates. For example, the Burlington line charged its customers west of the Mississippi four times what they charged customers east of the river.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Farmers had to borrow money to build homes, fertilize fields, and buy new equipment. Following the Civil War, America experienced a prolonged period of deflation in which both prices and the money supply fell. As a result, a farmer had to pay back loans with dollars that had doubled in value since he or she borrowed them.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Debt-ridden farmers believed that America’s strict adherence to the gold standard reduced the supply of money in circulation, thus limiting economic activity. This policy benefitted bankers and creditors while punishing debtors. Farmers argued that the free and unlimited coinage of silver would bring back prosperity by increasing the money supply, thereby spurring inflation and making it easier to repay debts.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE BIRTH OF THE POPULIST PARTY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>America’s increasingly militant farmers believed they had good reasons to organize a third party. Once praised as the backbone of American democracy, farmers now saw themselves as victims of an unjust system that penalized them with low crop prices and predatory railroad rates while rewarding Wall Street financiers with <span id="page_172"/>extravagant profits. Mary Ellen Lease captured the farmers’ militant mood when she advised them to “raise less corn and more hell.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The wave of agrarian discontent gave birth to the People’s or Populist Party. Although spearheaded by farmers, the movement included labor leaders, women’s rights activists, and socialists. In July 1892, 1,300 delegates met in Omaha, Nebraska, to formulate a platform and nominate a candidate for the fall election.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Populist Party platform emphatically demanded government control over the railroads and the free and unlimited coinage of silver. The platform also endorsed the eight-hour workday and the direct election of senators by voters instead of state legislators. A graduated income tax also ranked high on the list of Populist objectives. This meant that the more money a person earned, the more taxes he or she would pay. Populists believed that a graduated income tax would narrow the growing gap between the rich and the poor.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Populists nominated former congressman and Union general James B. Weaver of Iowa to run for president. Weaver received about 9 percent of the popular vote, more than any previous third-party candidate. In addition, the Populists elected 10 congressmen, 5 senators, and almost 1,500 members of different state legislatures. Buoyed by their success, the Populists eagerly looked forward to the 1896 presidential election.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE ELECTION OF 1896</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Republicans nominated William McKinley, the affable and well-liked governor of Ohio. The Republican platform supported both the gold standard and high protective tariffs.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan, a 36-year-old former congressman from Nebraska. Bryan was committed to a policy of free silver that would devalue money and help debtors. In a famous speech at the Democratic convention, Bryan galvanized cheering delegates by defiantly warning wealthy creditors, “You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold!”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Democrats’ decision to nominate a pro-silver candidate presented Populists with a difficult choice. Nominating their own candidate would divide the silver vote and ensure McKinley’s election. Endorsing Bryan would mean giving up their identity as a separate party. After much debate, the Populists chose to support Bryan.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_173"/>4<span class="C344">.</span>The charismatic Bryan broke with the tradition that a candidate did not go out and seek votes for himself. Instead, Bryan crisscrossed the country taking his campaign directly to the voters. The “Boy Orator” conveyed boundless energy as he delivered over 600 speeches extolling the benefits of free silver.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Bryan won the battle of speeches, but McKinley won the fight for votes. The Republicans captured all of the Northeast and the upper Midwest including the key states of Ohio and Illinois. As a result, McKinley won a solid victory in both the electoral college and the popular vote.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF THE ELECTION OF 1896</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The election of 1896 led to the swift collapse of the Populist Party. The silver issue melted away as gold strikes in South Africa, the Yukon, and Australia enlarged the money supply and reversed the deflationary spiral. In addition, crop failure in Europe led to an increase in American grain exports. As commodity prices rose, farmers entered a period of renewed prosperity lasting until the end of World War I.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Industrialization and urbanization were the driving forces reshaping American life. Bryan did not carry a single industrial state or large city. The election of 1896 began a generation of almost unbroken Republican dominance that lasted until the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The defeat of the Populists and the return of prosperity did not end the spirit of reform. A new generation of Progressives successfully fought for many reforms.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>FROM POPULISM TO PROGRESSIVISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>After the collapse of the Populist Party, the reform spirit shifted to the cities where a new generation of middle and upper-middle class reformers focused on a broad range of problems caused by industrialization and urbanization.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The term <em>progressivism</em> embraced a widespread, many faceted effort to build a more democratic and just society. The Progressive Era is usually dated from 1900 to America’s entry into World War I in 1917.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRESSIVE SPIRIT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Both the Populists and the Progressives rejected laissez-faire government policies. Instead, they wanted government to play an active role in public life. Progressives believed that complex social problems required a broad range of government responses. “The real heart of the movement,” declared one Progressive reformer, was “to use the government as an agency of human welfare.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Progressives were idealists who rejected the main tenets of Social Darwinism. They believed that conflict and competition would not inevitably improve society. Instead, they optimistically believed that informed citizens could create a just society that would reduce poverty, regulate corporations, protect the environment, and elect honest leaders.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE MUCKRAKERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the early 1900s, popular magazines such as <em>Collier’s</em> and <em>McClure’s</em> began to hire writers to expose corrupt practices in business and politics. Known as muckrakers, these investigative reporters expressed the new spirit of Progressive reform by uncovering social wrongs.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Muckraking magazines published more than 2,000 investigative reports between 1903 and 1912. For example, Ida Tarbell wrote a devastating exposé of the ruthless practices John D. Rockefeller used to eliminate competitors and build the Standard Oil Company into the “Mother of Trusts.” Muckraking articles by Tarbell and others enabled the spirit of Progressive reform to mobilize public opinion to demand and support needed reforms.</p>

<td class="C636y"><strong>TURNING POINTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY: WOMEN AND PROGRESSIVE REFORM</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE “NEW WOMAN”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When the Progressive Era began, men ran the nation’s businesses and cast all of its votes. The prevailing belief in the cult of domesticity restricted women to their homes. There were very few female lawyers, physicians, engineers, or scientists.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the Progressive Era, a generation of middle class “New Women” extended their roles as guardians of the home to include becoming activists who fought to improve their communities. Women thus became a major force behind many Progressive Era reforms.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CLUBS AND SETTLEMENT HOUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>By 1910 about 1 million women belonged to clubs. They embraced a new ideal called maternalism that expressed itself in a desire to improve their communities. Women’s clubs pressed local governments to build community playgrounds, enforce strict fire codes, open public libraries, and improve sanitation by purifying public water and instituting regular trash collection.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Women’s commitment to social reform extended to addressing problems faced by immigrants living in America’s crowded cities. Begun by Jane Addams in Chicago, the settlement house movement spread to hundreds of cities across America. Settlement houses gave women an opportunity to develop leadership skills and to build satisfying careers devoted to service and professional accomplishment.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Women played a leading role in the temperance movement to outlaw the sale of alcoholic beverages. The Women’s Christian Temperance Movement (WCTU) boasted 150,000 dues-paying members, making it one of the largest organizations of women in the world. Under the dynamic leadership of Frances Willard, the WCTU convinced many women that they had a moral duty to eliminate alcohol abuse and thus strengthen the stability of American families.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As the crusade against alcohol gathered momentum, more and more states outlawed saloons. In 1918, Congress passed the <span id="page_176"/>Eighteenth Amendment outlawing the manufacture, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquors.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When the Progressive Era began, the law denied criminals, lunatics, idiots, and women the right to vote. Beginning with the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, a determined group of women fought a long and at times frustrating battle for female suffrage.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Progressive movement sharpened the nation’s social conscience and motivated a new generation of suffragists. Led by Carrie Chapman Catt and Alice Paul, women organized rallies, signed petitions, and demonstrated in public marches. Their campaign of mounting pressure proved to be irresistible. On June 4, 1919, Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment stating that no citizen could be denied the right to vote “on account of sex.” The amendment constituted the largest single extension of democratic voting rights in American history.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>CONTINUITY AND CHANGE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When the Progressive Era ended, women still lacked significant political influence and remained largely absent from professional fields and management. At the same time, the lives of the vast majority of African American women remained the same.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1920s public attention turned from social activism to a new “normalcy” defined by a focus on leisure, mass entertainment, and material consumption. However, the Wall Street Crash and the resulting Great Depression reawakened interest in social reform. The reform efforts by women during the Progressive Era helped establish precedents for government to play an active role in public life. They thus provided a bridge between the Progressive Era and the New Deal. In addition, the pioneering “New Women” of the Progressive Era provided important role models for the feminist movement in the 1960s and ’70s.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>A DYNAMIC NEW PRESIDENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>An assassin’s bullet took President McKinley’s life just six months after his second inauguration. At age 42, Theodore Roosevelt became the youngest president in American history.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_177"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Roosevelt quickly became a major voice in the Progressive movement. Like other Progressives, TR believed that government should be used to solve the nation’s pressing problems. The dynamic force of his personality revitalized the presidency and established the White House as the focal point in American life.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ANTHRACITE COAL STRIKE, 1902</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On May 12, 1902, 147,000 members of the United Mine Workers (UMW) struck coal mines across Pennsylvania and West Virginia. TR invited both management and labor to the White House. When the owners refused to negotiate, TR threatened to order the Army to seize and operate the mines. Stunned by Roosevelt’s unprecedented threat, the owners reluctantly accepted federal arbitration.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Anthracite Coal Strike marked the first time that a President had successfully intervened in a labor dispute as an impartial arbiter. The settlement established TR’s reputation as a fearless champion of the working class. TR later wrote that his purpose was “to see to it that every man has a square deal.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>TR AND THE TRUSTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A trust is a large business combination formed by merging several smaller companies under the control of a single governing board. By 1901, giant trusts dominated the American economy. Like the Populists before them, Progressives complained that trusts restrained trade, fixed prices, and posed a threat to free markets.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 forbade unreasonable combinations “in restraint of trade or commerce.” The law, however, had been applied more vigorously to curb labor unions than to breakup trusts.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1902, TR used his executive power to order the attorney general to breakup the Northern Securities Company, a giant trust that monopolized rail traffic in the Northwest. Two years later, the Supreme Court upheld the antitrust suit and dissolved the company. This victory established TR’s reputation as a “trust buster.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CONSUMER PROTECTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Upton Sinclair’s muckraking novel <em>The Jungle</em> dealt with conditions in the Chicago meatpacking industry. Sinclair included a particularly graphic account of the filthy conditions in the packing houses: “There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and <span id="page_178"/>the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span><em>The Jungle</em> illustrates the relationship between muckraking and reform legislation during the Progressive Era. When federal inspectors confirmed Sinclair’s charges, an indignant public demanded action. Congress promptly passed the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act. These laws set strict new Federal standards for food and drugs destined for interstate commerce.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the second half of the nineteenth century, America’s westward expansion revealed the nation’s wealth of natural resources. Settlers, railroads, and lumber companies acted as if the nation’s forests and wildlife resources were inexhaustible. Lumber companies clear-cut richly forested regions while hunters annually killed 5 million birds to decorate women’s hats with prized feathers. By 1900, 24 species of mammals and 33 species of birds faced possible extinction.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The wanton waste of forest and wildlife resources sparked a growing public awareness that strong steps had to be taken to protect the nation’s endangered forests, wildlife, and scenic wonders. Congress took the first steps when it created Yellowstone National Park in 1872 and Yosemite National Park in 1890. Presidents Harrison, Cleveland, and McKinley used the Forest Reserve Act of 1891 to preserve 45 million acres of timberland.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ROOSEVELT AND THE CONSERVATIONISTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The appalling exploitation of America’s wilderness areas outraged Roosevelt. As a dedicated outdoorsman, he became a leader in the conservation movement. Conservationists believed that the environment and its resources should be managed in a responsible and sustainable manner.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Gifford Pinchot, TR’s first head of the National Forest Service, endorsed the conservationist perspective. With Roosevelt’s enthusiastic support, the federal government tripled the number of acres in its forest preserves.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_179"/>C.</strong></span><strong>ROOSEVELT AND THE PRESERVATIONISTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Roosevelt also sympathized with the viewpoint of a naturalist group known as preservationists. In contrast to the conservationists’ managed “hands-on” approach, preservationists advocated a strict “hands-off” approach to nature. They believed that people can have access to the land, but should only utilize it for beauty and inspiration.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, was America’s foremost advocate of the preservationist viewpoint. He wrote that national parks should be places for “rest, inspiration, and prayers.” He and TR spent four days camping together in Yosemite Valley. Inspired by the experience and by Muir’s writings, Roosevelt fulfilled many preservationist goals by adding 5 national parks, 4 national game preserves, 51 federal bird preserves, and 18 national monuments.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE HETCH HETCHY CONTROVERSY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Hetch Hetchy Valley is a spectacular river valley located in the northwest corner of Yosemite National Park. Pinchot and the conservationists viewed the valley as an ideal spot for a dam to supply water for San Francisco. Muir and the preservationists viewed the valley as “one of God’s best gifts [that] ought to be faithfully guarded.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The battle between the conservationists and the preservationists left TR with divided loyalties. After some indecision, he turned the issue to Pinchot who approved constructing the dam. Finally completed in 1934, the Hetch Hetchy Project includes a dam, reservoir, and a series of aqueducts that supply San Francisco with 80 percent of its water.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: LAND USE POLICY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Pinchot’s conservationist viewpoint has had a significant impact on America’s land use policy. The Hoover Dam, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) are all examples of managed land use projects.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Muir’s preservationist viewpoint has also had a significant impact on America’s land use policy. The creation of national monuments, historic sites, and national parks are all examples of preserving America’s natural and historic heritage.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>TR believed his hand-picked successor William Howard Taft would continue his progressive reforms. However, Taft was an inept politician who soon alienated Roosevelt’s Progressive supporters. When the Republican convention renominated Taft, Roosevelt formed the new Progressive or Bull Moose Party.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Sensing an opportunity to defeat the divided Republicans, the Democrats nominated New Jersey’s popular reform governor Woodrow Wilson. Wilson won the election thus becoming only the second Democrat elected since the Civil War.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>“THE TRIPLE WALL OF PRIVILEGE”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Once in office, Wilson launched a vigorous legislative offensive against what he called “the triple wall of privilege”—the tariff, the banks, and the trusts.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Roosevelt failed to address the issue of tariff reform. In contrast, Wilson successfully persuaded Congress to lower tariff rates by 8 percent.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Wilson next turned to reform of the nation’s banking system. The landmark Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established a system of twelve district banks coordinated by a Federal Reserve Board appointed by the President. The “Fed” had the power to raise and lower interest rates and issue paper currency. These financial tools enabled the Federal Reserve Board to control both credit and the supply of money.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Elated by his tariff and banking reforms, Wilson focused on the final wall of privilege—the trusts. The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 strengthened the Sherman Antitrust Act by prohibiting price discrimination and forbidding interlocking directorates between large companies. The Clayton Antitrust Act specifically exempted labor unions from antitrust prosecution.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_181"/>C.</strong></span><strong>RACIAL DISCRIMINATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Wilson did not include racial discrimination and white supremacy in his wall of privileges. As we have seen (<a href="28_Chapter_17_Reconstruction_and_th.html#page_129">Chapter 17</a>), Jim Crow laws, sanctioned by the Supreme Court’s “separate but equal” doctrine, created a wall of discrimination in the South. Despite their concern for social justice, Progressives largely ignored racial discrimination in the South.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Wilson reflected the entrenched racial attitudes of his time. In 1915, Hollywood director D.W. Griffith released <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, an explicitly racist film glorifying the Ku Klux Klan. Wilson allowed the film to be the first movie screened inside the White House. He enthusiastically endorsed the film’s racist message saying, “It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is so terribly true.”</p>
