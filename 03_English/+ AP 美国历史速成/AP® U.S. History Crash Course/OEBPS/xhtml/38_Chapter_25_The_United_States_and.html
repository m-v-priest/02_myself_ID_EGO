<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>America fought World War I as an idealistic crusade to “make the world safe for democracy.” However, the war left many Americans feeling bitterly disillusioned. Led by Henry Cabot Lodge, the Senate rejected the League of Nations and Wilson’s vision of a new world order based upon the principle of collective security.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although the United States rejected the League of Nations, it nonetheless emerged from the war as the world’s richest and most powerful nation. As a result, the United States could not avoid playing an active role in international affairs.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE WASHINGTON NAVAL CONFERENCE, 1921</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The United States could not ignore Japan’s growing threat to American interests in Asia. In 1921, the Harding administration invited Japan, Great Britain, and representatives from other European nations to Washington to discuss a range of Asian problems.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The expensive naval arms race among the United States, Great Britain, and Japan posed the most pressing problem. After intense negotiations, the powers agreed to limit battleship and aircraft carrier production. The Japanese also signed a treaty agreeing to respect China’s independence and America’s Open Door policy.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE DAWES PLAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Germany’s new democratic government faced a catastrophic period of hyperinflation as the value of the mark fell with terrifying speed. By the summer of 1923, a glass of beer cost 2 million marks and a loaf of bread 4 million marks.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The United States alone had the economic resources to rescue Germany. An international committee of financial experts led by <span id="page_218"/>Charles Dawes, an American banker and statesman, devised a plan to prevent the German economy from collapsing. The Dawes Plan provided an initial $200 million loan from American banks to stabilize Germany’s currency. The plan also created a more realistic schedule for German reparation payments.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Implemented in 1924, the Dawes Plan appeared to work. As the German economy revived, it attracted additional American loans that totaled over $3 billion. By 1929, Germany industrial output matched its prewar production.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE “SPIRIT OF LOCARNO”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1925, the French and German foreign ministers met in the Swiss town of Locarno where they signed a treaty promising that their two countries would never again resort to war against each other. World leaders praised the “spirit of Locarno” and admitted Germany into the League of Nations.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The “spirit of Locarno” soon led to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In 1928, the American Secretary of State Frank Kellogg used a foot-long gold pen to join the French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand in signing a pledge “to renounce war as an instrument of national policy.” Within a short time, almost every country in the world, including the Soviet Union, signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Kellogg-Briand Pact symbolized the world’s hope for a period of peace and prosperity. But this hope rested upon a belief that the late 1920s economic boom would continue.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Wall Street crash and the ensuing Great Depression sent shock waves across the industrialized world. Between 1929 and 1932, global manufacturing fell by 38 percent while international trade dropped by 65 percent. Unemployment rates skyrocketed causing angry, jobless workers to demand sweeping economic and political changes.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Millions of frightened people lost faith in their democratic governments and turned to fascism, a new political movement that denied individual rights and glorified rule by a militaristic dictator. Fascist leaders in Italy, Germany, and Japan seized power promising <span id="page_219"/>to revive economic growth, punish traitorous minorities, and restore national pride.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE MARCH OF FASCIST AGGRESSION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Italian dictator Benito Mussolini dreamed of resurrecting the glories of ancient Rome by building a colonial empire in Africa. In October 1935, Mussolini ordered a massive invasion of Ethiopia. His unprovoked attack represented a crucial test of the League of Nations’ commitment to collective security. Although the League condemned the violation of its charter, its members did nothing to stop Mussolini.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The League’s failure to deter Mussolini encouraged the German dictator Adolf Hitler to defy the Versailles Treaty. In March 1936, he boldly ordered 35,000 German troops into the Rhineland, a 30-mile-wide demilitarized zone on either side of the Rhine River that formed a strategic buffer between Germany and France. Hitler’s unexpected action stunned the British and French. Despite having sufficient military resources to repel the Germans, the French failed to act, fearing the risk of beginning a new war.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Japanese also took advantage of the League’s failure to stop aggression. By 1936, Japan’s new militaristic government renounced its Washington Conference agreements and withdrew from the League of Nations. In 1937, Japan invaded northern China touching off a full-scale war that marked the beginning of World War II in Asia.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>AMERICAN NEUTRALITY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>American isolationists argued that the United States should follow George Washington’s advice to avoid becoming politically involved in European affairs.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1934, Senator Gerald P. Nye chaired a special committee investigating American munitions dealers. After two years, the Nye Committee concluded that avaricious “merchants of death” duped America into entering World War I in order to earn enormous profits.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Nye Committee’s accusations led isolationists to demand that Congress pass laws to prevent a repeat of the mistakes that pushed the United States into the First World War. Between 1935 and 1937, Congress passed a series of three Neutrality Acts banning both loans and the sale of weapons to nations at war. The acts also warned Americans to avoid sailing on the ships of countries at war.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_220"/>D.</strong></span><strong>ROOSEVELT’S QUARANTINE SPEECH</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Roosevelt recognized that the United States could not isolate itself from the spreading fascist aggression. In his 1937 Quarantine Speech, FDR warned “[t]he peace-loving nations must make a concerted effort in opposition to those violations of treaties . . . which today are creating a state of international anarchy and instability from which there is no escape through mere isolation or neutrality.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>FDR’s argument that the United States should expand its role in global affairs failed to persuade the isolationists. Their muted response to his plea to “quarantine” the disease of fascist aggression convinced Roosevelt that he could not successfully challenge the prevailing public support for neutrality.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR IN EUROPE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>While America tried to remain at peace, Hitler plunged Europe into war. On September 1, 1939, Germany launched a massive blitzkrieg or “lightning war” against Poland. France and Britain immediately declared war on Germany.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>After a six-month lull in fighting, devastating German blitzkriegs led to the fall of Denmark, Norway, Belgium, and France. Only Great Britain, now led by Winston Churchill, held out against Hitler.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The alarming events in Europe persuaded Congress to increase the defense budget and approve a Selective Service Act providing for the country’s first military draft during peacetime.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE LEND-LEASE ACT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On December 8, 1940, President Roosevelt received an urgent message from Winston Churchill. The British Prime Minister bluntly warned that Great Britain was running out of supplies and money to continue its desperate fight against Nazi Germany.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_221"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>FDR recognized that a Nazi-dominated Europe would be a moral abomination and a direct threat to America’s national security. Aware of the public’s continuing strong isolationist sentiment, FDR resolved that America had to adopt a policy of “all aid short of war.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In a fireside chat on December 29, 1940, the president explained that America must become an “arsenal of democracy” by providing war materials to Great Britain. He then asked Congress to approve a Lend-Lease Act allowing him to send war materials to any country whose defense he considered vital to the United States.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>After months of acrimonious debates, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act on March 11, 1941. America’s depression-ridden industries now roared to life producing weapons to fight Hitler and Mussolini. Polls, however, still showed that 80 percent of the American people wanted to stay out of World War II.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>PEARL HARBOR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The debate over the Lend-Lease Act overshadowed ominous events taking place in Asia. Japan’s militaristic rulers became members of the Axis Powers along with Germany and Italy. Meanwhile, the long-standing rivalry between the United States and Japan for Pacific supremacy further escalated when Japanese forces overran French Indochina in July 1941. Recognizing Japan’s reliance upon imported American oil and scrap iron, FDR ordered a total embargo on trade with Japan.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The embargo forced Japanese leaders to make a fateful decision. They could give in to the American demand that they withdraw from Indochina or they could attack the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor and then seize the rich oil fields in the Dutch East Indies. When negotiations with the Roosevelt administration reached an impasse, the Japanese decided to launch a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In late November 1941, a Japanese fleet that included 6 aircraft carriers and over 400 warplanes secretly headed into the vast and empty waters of the North Pacific. At 7:55 <small>AM</small> on December 7, 1941, the first of three waves of planes attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Within two hours, Japanese warplanes sank or damaged 18 ships and killed 2,403 men.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The next day President Roosevelt asked Congress for a declaration of war against Japan. Four days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States. The Axis leaders confidently predicted that the United States would lack the will to fight a prolonged war. <span id="page_222"/>They were wrong. An angry and united America entered World War II determined to crush the Axis Powers.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Revenge and fear can fuel a very explosive combination of emotions. When the Japanese fleet struck Pearl Harbor, furious Americans demanded revenge. But revenge against Japan would have to wait for American factories to build a mighty armada of ships and planes.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As fear swept across America, it was easy to believe that the West Coast would be Japan’s next target. It was all too easy to displace anger and fear against Japan to the approximately 110,000 people of Japanese birth and descent who lived on the West Coast.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>EXECUTIVE ORDER 9066</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Japanese Americans at no time posed a military or security threat to the United States. Nonetheless, key California military and political officials and journalists agreed that “military necessity” demanded a forceful and immediate action.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt responded to the public outcry by signing Executive Order 9066 authorizing the military to evacuate all people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast. Japanese Americans had just 48 hours to dispose of their businesses and property before reporting to Army assembly centers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong><em>KOREMATSU v. UNITED STATES</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The government interred, or kept confined, about 110,000 Japanese Americans in ten detention camps located in desolate western lands owned by the federal government. The internment constituted the most serious violation of civil liberties during wartime in American history.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Fred Korematsu was a Japanese American who knowingly refused to obey the internment order. In <em>Korematsu v. United States</em> he argued that Executive Order 9066 deprived Japanese Americans of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. In a controversial decision, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the government’s evacuation policy citing the existence of “the gravest imminent danger to the public safety.”</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_223"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1988, Congress issued a formal apology to Japanese Americans and offered each individual camp survivor $20,000 in reparation. The legislation admitted that government actions were based on “race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>GET GERMANY FIRST</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Americans initially directed their anger at Japan. Roosevelt, however, realized that Hitler posed the greater threat to America’s long-term security. If the Nazis succeeded in defeating both Great Britain and the Soviet Union, they could transform Europe into an unconquerable fortress.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Given these strategic considerations, FDR and Churchill agreed upon a military strategy of defeating Hitler first. Churchill confidently predicted, “Hitler’s fate is sealed, Mussolini’s fate is sealed.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>BIG THREE DIPLOMACY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Known as the Big Three, Roosevelt, Churchill, and the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin first met in November 1943 at Tehran, Iran. The meeting confirmed that the United States and Great Britain would open a second front by invading France.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Known as D-Day, the Allied invasion of France began on June 6, 1944. Commanded by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, American, British, and Canadian troops successfully stormed the Normandy beaches and then liberated Paris less than three months later. Faced with American and British forces advancing from the west and Russian forces advancing from the east, Hitler took his own life on April 30, 1945.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Big Three held their second and final meeting at Yalta in February 1945. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to a temporary division of Germany. In return, Stalin agreed to join the war against Japan three months after the Nazis surrendered. Stalin also agreed that Poland should have a representative government based on free elections.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE PRODUCTION MIRACLE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When Stalin met Roosevelt at Tehran, the Soviet dictator offered this admiring toast: “To American production, without which this war would have been lost.” Stalin was right. American industry <span id="page_224"/>crushed the Axis powers beneath an overwhelming weight of weaponry.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Prior to World War II, airplanes and ships had been built one at a time. Led by Henry Ford and Henry Kaiser, American factories used assembly line techniques to mass-produce weapons. By 1944, round-the-clock shifts turned out a new bomber every hour and a cargo ship every 17 days. Between 1940 and 1945, American workers built a staggering total of 296,429 warplanes, 5,425 cargo ships, and 102,351 tanks and self-propelled guns.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Nearly 350,000 American women served in uniform, volunteering for the newly formed Women’s Army Corps (WACs) and other service branches. The women freed men for combat by performing 200 non-combat jobs stateside and in every theatre of the war. For example, women drove trucks, repaired planes, rigged parachutes, and served as radio and telephone operators. In addition, over 70,000 women provided vital service as army and navy nurses.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>World War II created new job opportunities for women. Between 1940 and 1945, almost 6 million additional female workers entered the labor force as the female percentage of the U.S. workforce rose from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The iconic “Rosie the Riveter” poster celebrated the women who worked in the nation’s munitions factories. The Rosie poster was more than just a patriotic symbol. Over 310,000 women worked in the aircraft industry in 1943 where they represented two-thirds of the total workforce. In addition, women welders, crane operators, and electricians performed heavy industrial jobs long considered “men’s work.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: WOMEN AND THE WORKFORCE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>World War II opened new opportunities for many American women. However, the war did not erode the traditional view that a woman’s primary role was still that of a wife and mother. <em>The New York Times</em> underscored this view of gender roles by confidently predicting, “The most important postwar plans of the majority of women in the WAC include just what all women want—their own homes and families.”</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_225"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Although World War II did not alter the widespread belief that women defense workers were playing a temporary role, it did serve as a vehicle for accelerating the ongoing process of increasing female participation in the labor force. World War II thus foreshadowed the dramatic expansion of women’s workforce participation that accompanied the second wave of feminism launched by the publication of <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> in 1963.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Great Depression slowed the historic exodus of African Americans from the rural South to northern and western cities. However, booming defense industries reignited the Great Migration, luring 700,000 blacks to leave the South.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Racial prejudice limited the social and economic gains African Americans hoped to achieve. In 1940, the president of North American Aviation reflected the prevailing prejudice among corporate managers when he explained, “While we are in complete sympathy with the Negro, it is against company policy to employ them as aircraft workers or mechanics . . . regardless of their training . . . there will be some jobs as janitors for Negroes.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>EXECUTIVE ORDER 8802</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Policies like the one announced by the aviation executive, outraged A. Philip Randolph. As the president of the all-black Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Randolph organized the March on Washington Movement to demand an end to racial discrimination in government and defense industries.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>President Roosevelt wanted to prevent a highly visible and divisive protest march by as many as 100,000 black Americans. Supported by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, the president issued Executive Order 8802, providing for “the full and equitable participation of all workers in defense industries, without discrimination because of race, creed, color, or national origin.” The order created the Fair Employment Practices Committee to monitor and enforce the presidential directive.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Executive Order 8802 is often described as an economic Emancipation Proclamation because it marked the first time since the end of Reconstruction that the federal government openly committed itself to opposing racial discrimination.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_226"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE “DOUBLE V” CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Black leaders pointed out that World War II provided a constant and painful daily reminder of the inequities faced by African Americans. For example, America’s 1.2 million black soldiers and sailors fought in strictly segregated units.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>African Americans were keenly aware of the contradiction between fighting for democracy abroad while enduring racial discrimination at home. Blacks enthusiastically supported a “Double V” campaign to win victory over fascism in Europe and victory over discrimination in the United States.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The March on Washington Movement and the “Double V” campaign expressed the new mood of militancy among African Americans. During the war, membership in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) surged from 50,000 to 450,000. In 1944, picketers outside a segregated restaurant in Washington, D.C., carried a placard that succinctly summarized America’s racial dilemma: “We Die Together. Let’s Eat Together.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The March on Washington Movement did not end with the declaration of Executive Order 8802. A. Philip Randolph’s strategy of taking the struggle for civil rights to the streets inspired Dr. King and other civil rights activists. In 1963, Randolph served as the head of the March on Washington at which Dr. King delivered his historic “I Have a Dream” speech. The march played a key role in mobilizing public support for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
