<p class="C337"><strong><span id="page_viii"/>ABOUT OUR AUTHOR</strong></p>
<p class="C338"><strong>Larry Krieger</strong> has been recognized by the College Board as one of the nation’s foremost AP<strong>®</strong> teachers.</p>
<p class="C338">In a career spanning more than 40 years, Mr. Krieger has taught in urban, rural, and suburban public high schools in North Carolina and New Jersey. His teaching repertoire spans a variety of AP<strong>®</strong> subjects including United States History, World History, European History, United States Government and Politics, and Art History. He is renowned for his energetic presentation, commitment to scholarship, and dedication to helping students achieve high AP<strong>®</strong> scores.</p>
<p class="C338">Mr. Krieger’s success has extended far beyond the classroom. He is the author of several widely used American History and World History textbooks, along with REA’s Crash Course books for AP<strong>®</strong> U.S. Government and Politics (1st Edition), European History, and Psychology. In addition, he has spoken at numerous Social Studies conferences and continues to hopscotch across America to conduct SAT<strong>®</strong> and AP<strong>®</strong> workshops for students and teachers.</p>
<p class="C338">This 5th edition of the AP<strong>®</strong> U.S. History Crash Course is based upon Mr. Krieger’s intensive study of the current APUSH Framework and released materials. He field-tested the materials in this book with students taking his APUSH prep courses. During the past five years, 90 percent of these students scored a 5, with the rest scoring 4s.</p>
<p class="C338">Mr. Krieger earned his B.A. and M.A.T. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and his M.A. from Wake Forest University.</p>
