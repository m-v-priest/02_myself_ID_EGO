<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE REVOLUTION OF 1800</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Thomas Jefferson and James Madison organized and led the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson narrowly defeated John Adams in the election of 1800, thus ending the Federalist decade.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The election of 1800 is often called “the Revolution of 1800” because there was a peaceful transfer of political power from the defeated Federalists to the victorious Democratic-Republicans.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In his inaugural address, Jefferson stressed that the “essential principles” of American government were above party politics. Striking a conciliatory tone, he reminded his fellow countrymen, “We are all Republicans; we are all Federalists.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Democratic-Republicans dominated the First Party Era as Jefferson and his fellow Virginians, James Madison and James Monroe, won six consecutive presidential elections. The Federalists disappeared on the national level in 1816.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>JEFFERSONIAN DEMOCRACY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jefferson promised to replace formal ceremonies that characterized the Federalist administration with what he called “republican simplicity.” For example, White House guests were encouraged to shake hands with the president rather than bowing as had been the Federalist practice.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Republican simplicity meant more than just a new code of presidential etiquette. In his inaugural address, Jefferson promised “a wise and frugal government.” Believing that the government governs best that governs least, Jefferson cut the budget, fired federal tax collectors, eliminated the tax on whiskey, and reduced both the army and the navy.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Jefferson wanted America to become an agrarian republic. He strongly believed that yeoman farmers exemplified virtue and independence from the corrupting influences of cities, bankers, financiers, and industrialists.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_68"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE, 1803</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Westerners depended upon the Mississippi River to ship their goods to New Orleans where they were reloaded aboard oceangoing vessels for shipment to the East Coast or to foreign ports.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1803, the French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, offered to sell the entire Louisiana Territory, including New Orleans, to the U.S. for just $15 million.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Jefferson now faced a dilemma. He recognized that Napoleon’s offer was too good to refuse. However, as a strict constructionist Jefferson worried that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to purchase new territory.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Jefferson’s advisors argued that the President’s power to make treaties gave him the implied power to purchase territory. Fearing that the capricious Napoleon might change his mind, Jefferson relented and the Senate overwhelmingly approved the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the U.S. Jefferson optimistically believed that the purchase would help fulfill his vision of America as an agrarian republic that would become an Empire of Liberty. Ironically, the lands acquired in the Louisiana Purchase later sparked a divisive sectional dispute over the spread of slavery into the western territories.</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>Jefferson sponsored the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory. The expedition mapped the upper reaches of the Missouri River, explored the Columbia River, strengthened America’s claim to the Oregon Territory, and increased general scientific knowledge about Northwest America.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong><em>MARBURY v. MADISON</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1801 to 1835, John Marshall issued a number of landmark decisions that strengthened the power of the federal government, upheld the supremacy of federal law over state legislatures, and promoted business enterprise.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Marshall established the principle of judicial review in the famous case of <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>. Judicial review gave the Supreme Court the power to declare unconstitutional a governmental action found to violate some provision of the Constitution.</p>
<div class="C565"><p class="C564"><img alt="" src="../img/30_1.jpg"/></p></div>
<p class="C568"><strong><em><span id="page_69"/>APUSH test writers will not expect you to recall the details of</em> Marbury v. Madison<em>, but they will expect you to know that the case established the principle of judicial review. This power gave the Supreme Court the authority to make definitive rulings on the meaning of the Constitution</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE EMBARGO OF 1807</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Although he was an ardent supporter of the French Revolution, Jefferson continued Washington’s policy of neutrality.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1807, Jefferson persuaded Congress to pass an Embargo Act stopping all exports of American goods to Europe. Jefferson hoped the embargo would enable the United States to avoid being drawn into the ongoing conflict between Great Britain and France.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>As in the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson once again drew upon the loose constructionist doctrine of implied powers. He argued that the government’s power to regulate commerce could be used to justify imposing an embargo.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The embargo proved to be very unpopular with New England shippers. Ironically, it had the unforeseen effect of promoting manufacturing in the region.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Both Jefferson and his successor James Madison followed a policy of neutrality hoping to avoid war with either Great Britain or France. However, the British policy of impressing American seamen and forcing them into the Royal Navy outraged Americans. Led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, a group of “War Hawks” in Congress demanded war with Britain as the only recourse to defend American honor.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The War Hawks also hoped to drive Britain from Canada and remove Indians from the frontier.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The War of 1812 restored American pride and reaffirmed the young republic’s independence. It also ensured Canada’s independence from the United States.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_70"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The British defeat dealt a severe blow to Indians living in the Midwest by depriving them of their strongest ally.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>On January 8, 1815, American forces led by General Andrew Jackson won a decisive battle defending New Orleans from British attack. The victory transformed Jackson into a national hero.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>While Jackson was preparing to defend New Orleans, a group of disgruntled Federalists were meeting in Hartford, Connecticut, to oppose the war and discuss ways of limiting the power of the federal government. The Hartford Convention released its report as news of Jackson’s victory spread across the country. The Hartford Convention contributed to the demise of the Federalist Party by making its leaders appear to be unpatriotic.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The War of 1812 interrupted trade, thus contributing to the process of industrialization begun by the Embargo Act of 1807.</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>The War of 1812 intensified a new spirit of nationalism. A newly “federalized” President Madison now supported re-chartering the National Bank and increasing tariffs to protect America’s “infant” industries from foreign competition.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>A SURGE OF NATIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>James Monroe overwhelmed his Federalist opponent in the 1816 presidential election. He was then reelected in 1820 without opposition.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Monroe’s presidency began with a surge of nationalism. One Boston newspaper captured the optimistic spirit of the time when it proclaimed that Monroe’s election marked the beginning of an “Era of Good Feelings.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE AMERICAN SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Sponsored by Henry Clay, the American System supported the national bank to promote economic stability, called for a tariff to raise revenue and protect American industries, and endorsed a program of federal support for internal improvements or transportation projects to unite the country.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Clay’s American System was similar to Alexander Hamilton’s economic vision. Both programs favored a strong federal government to strengthen the Union by promoting commerce and stimulating economic growth.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_71"/>C.</strong></span><strong>JUDICIAL NATIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Marshall Court continued to render landmark decisions that opposed states’ rights and strengthened the power of the federal government.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In <em>McCulloch v. Maryland,</em> the Court struck down a Maryland law taxing a branch of the Second Bank of the United States. The decision established the supremacy of federal laws over state laws. Marshall declared the National Bank constitutional by confirming the right of Congress to utilize its implied powers.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In <em>Gibbons v. Ogden,</em> the Court declared that only Congress has the constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce. The decision established the commerce clause as a key mechanism for the expansion of federal power.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE MONROE DOCTRINE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In his final message to Congress on December 2, 1823, Monroe announced a new American foreign policy toward Latin America.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Monroe’s unilateral declaration of principles stated that republican governments in the Americas were different and separate from the monarchical systems in Europe. As the protector of republican institutions, the United States would not tolerate the creation of new European colonies in the Western Hemisphere. Monroe further demanded that the European powers stay out of the internal affairs of the newly independent American nation.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In return, Monroe promised that the United States would not interfere with any established European colonies in the Western Hemisphere or in the internal affairs of any European nation.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Monroe Doctrine had little effect at the time. The European powers refrained from interfering in the New World because of the power of British warships, not the eloquence of Monroe’s words.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: U.S. POLICY TOWARD LATIN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Monroe’s declaration was a sign of America’s growing self-confidence in the Era of Good Feelings. First called the Monroe Doctrine in 1852, the principles Monroe proclaimed became the cornerstone of American foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Theodore Roosevelt also worried about European intervention in Latin America. In December 1904, Roosevelt updated the Monroe Doctrine declaring that “flagrant cases of wrongdoing” in Central America and the Caribbean “may force the United States to <span id="page_72"/>exercise an international police power.” Known as the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, this unilateral declaration changed the Monroe Doctrine from a statement against the intervention of European powers in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere to a justification of the unrestricted American right to regulate affairs in the Caribbean and Central America.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The spirit of nationalism brought Americans together. But a debate over the extension of slavery into the Louisiana Territory sparked a divisive spirit of sectionalism.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>When George Washington took office in 1789, the North and South were roughly equal in wealth and population. However, with each passing decade the North steadily outgained the South in population growth. By 1819, the free states in the North had 105 representatives in the House compared with just 81 representatives for the South.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>While the North controlled a solid majority of votes in the House, the Senate was evenly but precariously balanced between 11 free and 11 slave states.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>“A SACRED PACT”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1819, the territory of Missouri applied for statehood as a slave state. The Northern controlled House of Representatives responded by passing the Tallmadge Amendment prohibiting the further introduction of slaves into Missouri and providing for the gradual emancipation of the 10,000 slaves already in the territory.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Outraged Southerners believed that the Tallmadge Amendment threatened the future of the plantation system while also implying an attack on the Southern way of life. Although the Senate rejected the Tallmadge Amendment, the issue of extending slavery into the western territories ignited a passionate sectional debate that shattered the harmony of the Era of Good Feelings.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>House Speaker Henry Clay promoted a compromise that settled the dispute by admitting Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state. In addition, the Missouri Compromise prohibited slavery in the remaining portion of the Louisiana Purchase north of latitude 36° 30<strong>′</strong>. <span id="page_73"/>Many in the North viewed the 36° 30<strong>′</strong> line as “a sacred pact” that should never be broken.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>“A FIRE BELL IN THE NIGHT”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Before the Missouri controversy, many thoughtful Southern leaders acknowledged that slavery was a necessary evil inherited from their colonial ancestors. But a new generation of Southern leaders increasingly began to defend slavery as a positive good.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>While Southerners defended slavery, many in the North began to fear that the institution posed a threat to free labor and industrial expansion. A small but vocal group of critics also began to question the morality of slavery.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Missouri Compromise temporarily defused the political crisis over slavery. However, the debate foreshadowed the sectional controversies that dominated American political life in the 1840s and 1850s. The Congressional power struggle that produced the Missouri Compromise created “the North” and “the South” as rival political sections.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>An alarmed Thomas Jefferson sensed the future peril when he wrote, “This momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE ELECTION OF 1824</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Era of Good Feelings proved to be brief. The contentious debate over slavery and the return of partisan political factions within the Democratic-Republican Party eroded the consensus on national goals that had been the hallmark of the Monroe presidency.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1824, four regional candidates vied for the presidency. Andrew Jackson received more popular and electoral votes than his rivals John Quincy Adams, William Crawford, and Henry Clay. Since Jackson did not receive a majority of the electoral votes, the election went to the House of Representatives, which voted by states.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>As Speaker of the House, Clay occupied a unique position of power. Clay despised Jackson as a “military chieftain” who was unfit for office. Although Clay was not personally close to Adams, the two men were both nationalists who supported the American System. Clay’s influence prevailed and Adams won the presidency.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_74"/>4<span class="C344">.</span>Shortly after winning the House vote, Adams named Clay his new Secretary of State. Jackson’s outraged supporters promptly accused Adams and Clay of a “corrupt bargain” that thwarted the will of the people by cheating Jackson out of the presidency.</p>
<div class="C565"><p class="C564"><img alt="" src="../img/30_1.jpg"/></p></div>
<p class="C568"><strong><em>Be prepared for a short-answer question asking you to define the Era of Good Feelings and provide evidence supporting why this is and is not an appropriate historic label for the period between 1816 and 1824</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE DISAPPOINTING PRESIDENCY OF JOHN Q. ADAMS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A confirmed nationalist, Adams hoped to accomplish great projects. He championed an ambitious program of internal improvements and called upon Congress to establish a national university and build an astronomical observatory in Washington.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Adams’ presidency proved to be disappointing. Although he possessed a brilliant intellect, Adams lacked personal charm and a common touch. His alleged political deal with Clay tarnished his presidency. Jackson’s fervent supporters in Congress undermined the Adams presidency by voting down most of his proposals. They eagerly looked forward to the presidential election of 1828 when they fully expected the popular will to prevail.</p>
