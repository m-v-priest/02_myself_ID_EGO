<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE STOCK MARKET</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The big bull market reached its peak on September 3, 1929. On that date, the New York Times average price of industrial stocks reached 452. That figure represented a gain of 342 points from January 1921 and 114 points from January 1929.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Wall Street’s speculative bubble burst on Thursday, October 24, 1929 (which came to be known as “Black Thursday”), as waves of panic selling overwhelmed the New York Stock Exchange. The selling reached a crescendo on Tuesday, October 29. Within less than a week, stocks lost 37 percent of their value.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>At first the Wall Street crash appeared to have only hurt the roughly 3 million investors who owned stock. The United States’ vast industrial and agricultural resources were physically undamaged. But the stock market crash had dealt a severe blow to investors and to banks. It also revealed serious underlying economic weaknesses.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>OVERPRODUCTION AND UNDERCONSUMPTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1929, American factories produced nearly half of the world’s industrial goods. Rising productivity generated enormous profits. However, this wealth was unevenly distributed. At the time of the crash, the richest 5 percent of the population earned nearly one-third of all personal income. Meanwhile, fully 60 percent of all American families earned less than the $2,000 a year needed to buy basic necessities. Eighty percent of the nation’s families had no savings whatsoever.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The U.S. economy was simultaneously experiencing overproduction by business and underconsumption by consumers. As inventories of unsold goods piled up, stores reduced their orders and factories began to cut back production and layoff workers. These actions triggered a downward economic spiral.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_206"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE PLIGHT OF THE FARMER</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Many farmers never shared in the prosperity of the 1920s. Scientific farming methods combined with new trucks and tractors enabled farmers to dramatically increase the yield of crops per acre. At the same time, American farmers faced new competition from grain growers in Australia and Argentina.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The global surpluses of agricultural products drove prices and farm incomes down. Between 1929 and 1933 agricultural income plunged by 60 percent. Unable to sell their crops for a profit, many farmers could not pay their mortgages. By early 1933, embittered farm families watched helplessly as banks foreclosed on about 20,000 farms a month.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>DOWN! DOWN! DOWN!</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Between 1929 and 1932, all the major indicators documented the same story of economic collapse. By July 1932 the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted to an all-time low of 58 as investors lost $74 billion. During these three years, 86,000 businesses closed their doors and 9,000 banks declared bankruptcy wiping out 9 million savings accounts.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The burden of hard times fell most heavily on those least able to afford it. Unemployment rose from just 3.2 percent in 1929 to a staggering 24.9 percent in 1932. Poverty soon became a way of life for one-fourth of the population.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE DUST BOWL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Beginning in 1930, a severe drought hit the Great Plains. The lack of rain combined with unusually hot summers created great clouds of dust from what had once been fertile soil. Large areas of Kansas, the Texas panhandle, Oklahoma, and eastern Colorado became known as the Dust Bowl.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Agriculture virtually ceased in the hardest hit parts of the Dust Bowl. Over 350,000 desperate people fled the Great Plains. Called “Oakies” because many came from Oklahoma, they loaded their meager belongings into battered cars and headed west along Route 66 to California. John Steinbeck captured the ordeal faced by these proud but impoverished migrants in his powerful novel <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>. Dorothea Lange’s poignant photographs portrayed their struggle in California.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>HOOVER’S PHILOSOPHY OF GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Hoover believed that America’s economy was fundamentally sound. In March 1930 he confidently predicted, “The crisis will be over in 60 days.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Despite rising unemployment and falling industrial production, Hoover rejected calls for federal action. He argued that a program of federal relief would violate the Constitution and undermine his cherished values of rugged individualism and local voluntarism.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE RECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPORATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>While Hoover rejected federal programs to help the poor, he did listen to bank executives who pleaded for federal aid. In early 1932, Congress created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to make emergency loans to distressed banks and businesses. The RFC loaned $1.75 billion to 7,400 banks, insurance companies, and railroads.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The RFC went beyond anything the federal government had ever done before. Its emergency loans helped limit the number of bankruptcies. However, indignant critics accused Hoover of insisting on rugged individualism for ordinary people standing in breadlines while supporting a “billion-dollar soup kitchen” for distressed bankers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE BONUS ARMY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the spring of 1932, about 20,000 World War I veterans converged on Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress to pass a bill providing the immediate payment of their promised bonuses from the First World War.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Supported by Hoover, the Senate rejected the bill. Despite this defeat, many veterans and their families encamped in Washington. Embarrassed by the presence of so many unemployed men in the nation’s capital, Hoover ordered the army to forcibly remove the Bonus Marchers. His callous treatment of the veterans accelerated Hoover’s already sinking popularity.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE ELECTION OF 1932</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The deepening depression crippled any chance Hoover had of being reelected. Sensing victory, the Democrats nominated <span id="page_208"/>Franklin D. Roosevelt, the popular reform-minded governor of New York. FDR won an overwhelming victory, ushering in a period of Democratic political dominance that lasted 20 years.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the presidential campaign, FDR inspired the Democratic convention by promising cheering delegates, “I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE BANKING CRISIS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When FDR took the oath of office on March 4, 1933, he boldly declared, “First of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself–nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror.” Despite Roosevelt’s calming reassurance, thirty-eight states closed their banks, as America’s economy tottered on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>FDR knew he had to restore public confidence in the nation’s banking system. While his economic advisors prepared emergency legislation for Congress, Roosevelt proclaimed a four-day bank holiday. On March 9, both houses of Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act. The act provided for reopening the nation’s largest and strongest banks while weaker banks first received loans and then later opened under strict Treasury Department supervision.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>On March 12, FDR addressed the nation by radio in his first fireside chat. The president explained the steps Congress had taken and reassured the public that “it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.” FDR’s strategy restored public confidence as deposits far exceeded withdrawals. A few months later Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), insuring bank deposits up to $2,500. The FDIC underscored the government’s commitment to protecting deposits and preventing another panic. (Today each depositor is insured to $250,000 per insured bank.)</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The banking crisis set the tone for the New Deal. FDR opposed making drastic changes. Instead of nationalizing the banks, he strove to reform and revive America’s economic institutions.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>RELIEF MEASURES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The banking crisis marked the beginning of a history-making period known as the Hundred Days. From March 9 to June 16, <span id="page_209"/>1933, Congress approved fifteen major pieces of social and economic legislation formulated by a group of presidential advisors known as the “brain trust.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Unlike Hoover, Roosevelt recognized that America’s millions of unemployed workers needed direct federal relief. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) created a jobs program for unemployed young men aged 18 to 25. The men lived in camps and worked on a variety of conservation projects in the nation’s parks and recreation areas. During the nine years of its existence, over 2.5 million workers earned $30 a month cutting trails, building reservoirs, and planting a shelter-belt of 200 million trees stretching from Texas to Canada.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Public Works Administration (PWA) contributed to the New Deal’s relief program by financing more than 34,000 construction projects at a cost of more than $6 billion. Between 1933 and 1939, armies of PWA workers constructed about 35 percent of the new hospitals and health facilities in the U.S. and 70 percent of all educational buildings.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The New Deal relief programs did not end unemployment. But they did restore a sense of national purpose and energy missing since the depths of the depression.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>RECOVERY MEASURES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>FDR asked Congress to take unprecedented action to meet the farm crisis. The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) proposed to increase farm income by paying farmers to leave acres unplanted. For example, the nation’s wheat growers removed some 8 million acres of wheat from production. As a result, the average price of wheat rose from 38 cents a bushel in 1932-1933 to 74 cents a bushel in 1933-1934. Despite the initial outcry over reducing crops at a time when people were hungry, the prices of wheat, corn, cotton, and other basic agricultural products began to rise.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The brain trust created a bold program to stimulate industrial recovery. The National Recovery Act (NRA)—which was part of the broader National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA)—encouraged the nation’s businesses to draw up codes defining minimum prices, wages, and workers’ hours. The NRA codes were supposed to end excess competition and restore profits. Launched with great fanfare, the NRA soon aroused a barrage of criticism from opponents who denounced it as a formula for “creeping socialism.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) contributed to the New Deal’s recovery program by authorizing the construction of a <span id="page_210"/>system of dams and hydroelectric plants to provide inexpensive electricity and flood control for residents of the impoverished Tennessee Valley. This ambitious program of regional planning helped to stimulate growth in an area that had been amongst America’s most underdeveloped regions.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: PROGRESSIVE REFORM AND THE NEW DEAL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Both the Progressive Era and New Deal reformers supported government action to remedy social and economic problems. However, neither the Progressives nor the New Dealers directly addressed the problems of racial discrimination and segregation faced by African Americans.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Progressive Era reformers favored legislative actions by state and local governments. They did not endorse direct federal relief for the unemployed or the poor. In contrast, the New Dealers favored federal legislation to provide jobs and direct relief.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The New Deal helped pull America out of the depths of the Great Depression. Industrial production slowly rose and unemployment fell from about 13 million in 1933 to 9 million in 1936.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Despite these gains, full recovery still remained elusive. A contentious group of critics attacked the New Deal and offered radical plans to revive the economy.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THREE RADICAL CRITICS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Father Charles Coughlin was a Catholic priest from Detroit. Known as the “Radio Priest,” Coughlin delivered weekly radio sermons to a nationwide audience estimated at over 30 million people. Like the late nineteenth century Populists, Coughlin supported nationalizing the banks and coining more silver dollars.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Francis E. Townsend was a retired physician who argued that the New Deal did not do enough for older Americans. Outraged by the sight of three elderly women looking for food in garbage cans, Townsend proposed giving everyone over the age of 60 a monthly government check for $200.00. The recipient had to promise to spend all the money each month. Townsend Clubs quickly spread across the country as more than 10 million people signed petitions endorsing the doctor’s plan.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_211"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>Huey Long was a colorful and controversial governor and U.S. Senator from Louisiana. Known as the “Kingfish,” Long broke with the New Deal. He then developed his own “Share Our Wealth” program promising to tax the rich and guarantee each American a $5,000 home and an annual income of $2,500. When a national poll indicated that Long might win strong support on a third-party ticket, he announced his intention to run for President in 1936. Then in September 1935, an assassin shot and killed Long on the steps of the Louisiana capitol in Baton Rouge.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Father Coughlin, Dr. Townsend, and Senator Long drew support from desperate Americans demanding more dramatic changes. FDR recognized that he had to “steal the thunder” from these outspoken critics by embracing additional reforms.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The 1934 mid-term elections gave the Democrats commanding majorities in both the House and the Senate. “Boys, this is our hour,” Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins exalted. “We’ve got to get everything we want—a works program, social security, wages and hours, everything—now or never.” Led by Roosevelt and Hopkins, the Democratic majorities did enact a series of far-reaching programs known as the Second New Deal.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE WORKS PROJECTS ADMINISTRATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Congress enacted the Works Projects Administration (WPA) in April 1935. Initially funded with $5 billion, the WPA launched an ambitious program that included constructing 600,000 miles of highways, repairing 100,000 bridges, and erecting thousands of public parks and recreational facilities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The WPA did more than hire construction workers. It also funded innovative projects designed to utilize the skills of artists, actors, and writers. For example, the Federal Art Project employed artists to paint murals for post offices, libraries, and other public buildings across America.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Signed by President Roosevelt on August 14, 1935, the Social Security Act answered the Townsend Plan by enacting the New Deal’s most far-reaching legislative initiative. The act established a pension for retired people over the age of sixty-five. A small <span id="page_212"/>payroll tax paid by both workers and employers financed the fund. In addition, the Social Security Act committed the national government to a broad range of social welfare activities including federal grants-in-aid for old age assistance and aid for dependent children.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Social Security Act had important limitations. It initially excluded farm laborers, domestic servants, and the self-employed. It also took money out of workers’ paychecks at a time when low consumer demand remained one of the main causes of the depression.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Second New Deal gave the labor movement a significant victory with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Often called the Wagner Act for its sponsor, New York Senator Robert Wagner, the NLRA protected the right of workers to join unions and bargain collectively with management.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The NLRA also created a National Labor Relations Board to supervise union elections and investigate unfair labor practices by employers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: LABOR UNIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The NLRA revitalized the union movement in America. When the Great Depression began, trade unions represented only about 3 million workers. John L. Lewis, the head of the United Mine Workers, took the lead in forming the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to unionize automobile and steel workers. By the end of the 1930s, unions represented 9 million workers, or 28 percent of the nonfarm workforce.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Membership in labor unions peaked in 1954 when 35 percent of American workers belonged to a union. However, the twin forces of deindustrialization and automation began to substantially reduce the number of industrial jobs. By 2015, union membership stood at just 11.1 percent of all American workers. The largest and most prominent unions today are public sector employees such as government workers, teachers, and police.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN THE NIRA AND THE AAA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the summer of 1935, the Supreme Court began to deliver a series of decisions overturning key New Deal programs. In <em>Schechter v. United States</em>, the Court unanimously struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) because it gave the federal government powers of economic regulation that could not be justified under the interstate commerce clause. A few months later the Court also invalidated the AAA.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>These decisions alarmed President Roosevelt. New Dealers feared that the Supreme Court would soon strike down the Social Security Act and the Wagner Act.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE COURT-PACKING SCHEME</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Determined to prevent the Supreme Court from overturning the New Deal, FDR surprised Congress by asking for the authority to appoint a new Supreme Court justice for every member older than 70. This would allow Roosevelt to appoint six new justices more receptive to the New Deal.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Both the public and members of Congress opposed Roosevelt’s “court-packing” bill as a violation of judicial independence and the separation of powers. Although the Democrats enjoyed large majorities in both houses of Congress, they refused to approve the Court Reform Bill. The rejection marked FDR’s first major legislative defeat.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Although FDR lost the court-packing battle, he ultimately achieved his goal as the Supreme Court became more receptive to the New Deal. The Court upheld both the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act. In addition, several justices retired and Roosevelt appointed nine new members of the Court.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The New Deal did not directly confront racial injustice. For example, the CCC camps often segregated white and black workers. In addition, FDR did not risk losing the support of <span id="page_214"/>southern Democrats by endorsing legislation banning the poll tax and making lynching a crime.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although the New Deal did not mark a turning point in American race relations, it did mark the beginning of important steps benefitting African Americans. For example, FDR appointed a number of black officials to his administration who became known as the “Black Cabinet.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW DEAL AND AMERICAN POLITICS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Herbert Hoover’s election in 1928 continued the era of Republican dominance that began with the election of McKinley in 1896. However, just four years later a revitalized Democratic Party led by Franklin Roosevelt brought an abrupt end to the period of Republican dominance. The voting blocs and interest groups that supported FDR are known as the New Deal coalition.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The New Deal coalition included urban families, labor unions, Catholics, Jews, white Southerners, and African Americans. These voters formed an electoral majority that enabled the Democratic Party to win the White House in seven of the nine presidential elections between 1932 and 1968.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Although the New Deal did not directly confront Jim Crow segregation, it did help African Americans survive the Great Depression. In the 1936 presidential election, over 90 percent of black voters switched their allegiance to FDR and the Democratic Party.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The New Deal coalition of black and white Southern voters proved to be fragile. As the Democratic Party began to endorse civil rights legislation in the 1960s, its support among white Southerners steadily eroded. Today, white Southerners are a key component in the Republican Party and African Americans are a key component in the Democratic Party.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW DEAL AND WOMEN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Many observers noted that women seemed invisible during the Great Depression. The PWA and other New Deal agencies almost exclusively hired men. The CCC excluded women entirely, prompting critics to ask, “Where is the she-she-she?”</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_215"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Although the New Deal did not directly challenge gender inequality, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt did play an important role in promoting equal treatment for women and African Americans. In one highly publicized incident, Eleanor Roosevelt resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution to protest the organization’s decision to ban Marian Anderson, a world-renowned African American singer, from performing at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. With Eleanor Roosevelt’s support, Anderson gave an Easter Sunday concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial attended by an integrated audience of 75,000 people.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As 1937 opened, FDR optimistically pointed to several promising signs of economic recovery. Unemployment fell to 14 percent and industrial output returned to pre-crash levels. Confident that the economic crisis was receding, Roosevelt reduced funding for New Deal programs. These cuts triggered a sudden downturn known as the “Roosevelt Recession” of 1937–38.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Historian William Leuchtenburg described the New Deal as a “halfway revolution.” He argued that conservative Democrats prevented FDR from fully implementing a program of deficit spending. Advocated by the British economist John Maynard Keynes, this strategy called for the government to stimulate the economy by spending more money than it received in taxes.</p>

Under the New Deal, the federal government assumed the responsibility for ensuring the health of the nation’s economy and the welfare of its citizens.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>New Deal programs provided tangible examples of the importance of the federal government. For example, the New Deal provided legal protection for labor unions, price stability for farmers, electricity for rural Americans, and old age insurance for the elderly.</p>
