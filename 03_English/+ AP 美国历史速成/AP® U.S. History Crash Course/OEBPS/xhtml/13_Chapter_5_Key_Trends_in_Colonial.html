<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Cane sugar was the first product in human history that satisfied the universal desire to sweeten food and drink.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Columbus introduced sugar cane to Hispaniola. Within a short time, a “white gold” rush began as sugar plantations spread across the island.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Other European nations saw the Caribbean sugar islands as a path to acquiring vast wealth.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE BRITISH SUGAR ISLANDS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The pursuit of sugar profits drew English colonists to Barbados and Jamaica.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1650, more white colonists lived on Barbados (30,000) than either the Chesapeake (12,000) or New England colonies (23,000).</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Sugar was by far the most valuable crop grown in the British Empire. Led by Barbados, in 1700 the English West Indies produced about 25,000 tons of sugar worth four times the value of Chesapeake tobacco.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>SUGAR AND SLAVERY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Sugar plantations required large fields, costly equipment, and a huge labor force working under strict supervision.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>After beginning with indentured servants, planters in Barbados turned to importing enslaved Africans. In 1644 only about 800 slaves worked on Barbados. Just 16 years later, the number swelled to 27,000.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Between 1701 and 1810, sugar planters imported 252,000 enslaved Africans to Barbados and 662,400 to Jamaica.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_36"/>D.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT ON TRANSATLANTIC TRADE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The combination of sugar and slavery fueled the rapid expansion of a transatlantic trading network. By 1700 a complex network of lucrative trade routes interconnected the economies of the West Indies, the mainland colonies, England, and Africa.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>It is important to note that West Indian planters devoted almost all their land to cultivating sugar cane. They found it less expensive to import lumber, fish, livestock, and grain from the New England and Middle colonies.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE ECONOMIC THEORY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Great Britain attempted to integrate its North American colonies into a cohesive imperial structure based upon the prevailing economic principles of mercantilism.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Mercantilism was intended to enable Great Britain to achieve a favorable balance of trade by exporting more than it imported. Britain expected to achieve this goal by purchasing raw materials from its North American colonies and then selling them more expensive manufactured goods.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Mercantilism thus protected English industry while making the colonies dependent upon their mother country.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE NAVIGATION ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Parliament enacted a series of Navigation Acts designed to implement its mercantilist policies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Navigation Acts stipulated that no ship could trade in the colonies unless it had been constructed in either England or America. In addition, certain valuable enumerated goods such as sugar, tobacco, rice, and indigo had to be transported from the colonies only to an English or another colony’s port.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_37"/>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Navigation Acts had the unintended consequence of encouraging the growth of maritime commerce and shipbuilding in New England.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Navigation Acts were not rigorously enforced. Prior to 1763, a long period of “salutary neglect” enabled enterprising colonial merchants to successfully evade burdensome mercantile regulations. For example, New England merchants reaped great profits trading fish and lumber to French sugar islands. As a result, the colonists developed a growing spirit of economic independence.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The First Great Awakening was a wave of religious revivals that began in New England in the mid-1730s and swept across the colonies during the 1740s.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>New Light ministers deemphasized ceremony and ritual. Instead, they advocated a spontaneous and emotional religious experience that threatened the authority of traditional Old Light Puritan and Episcopal ministers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>JONATHAN EDWARDS AND GEORGE WHITEFIELD</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jonathan Edwards helped spark the Great Awakening by delivering emotional sermons warning sinners to repent. His most famous sermon, “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” painted a vivid picture of the torments of hell and the certainty of God’s justice.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>George Whitefield was a particularly charismatic preacher who spread New Light fervor to huge audiences from Georgia to Maine. He castigated the learned but boring Old Light sermons claiming that, “The reason why congregations have been dead, is because they had dead men preaching to them.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CONSEQUENCES: THE FIRST GREAT AWAKENING</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>It led to a greater appreciation of the emotional experience of faith.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>It promoted the growth of New Light institutions of higher learning such as Princeton, Brown, and Dartmouth.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_38"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>It added to the growing popularity of itinerant ministers.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>It led to divisions within both the Presbyterian and Congregational churches, resulting in growing religious diversity.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>It increased the number of women in church congregations.</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>It sparked a renewed missionary spirit that led to the conversion of many slaves.</p>
<p class="C369">7<span class="C344">.</span>It promoted greater independence and diversity of thought that encouraged challenges to political authority during the 1760s and 1770s.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>DECLINE OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1492, as many as 10 million Native Americans may have lived in the territory that became the United States.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>By 1700, contagious diseases and warfare reduced the Native American population to less than 2 million people.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>GROWTH OF THE ENSLAVED AFRICAN POPULATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The number of imported enslaved Africans to North America jumped from 10,000 in the seventeenth century to almost 400,000 in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although slavery was legal in all 13 colonies, about 90 percent of enslaved Africans lived and worked in the South.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Slaves were able to maintain cultural practices brought from Africa.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>GROWTH AND DIVERSITY OF THE WHITE COLONIAL POPULATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1700, fewer than 300,000 whites inhabited the British North American colonies. By 1775, this figure swelled to 2 million. A soaring birth rate accounted for most of the population increase as the colonists doubled their number every twenty-five years.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Emigration from England actually declined between 1700 and 1775 as only 80,000 left their homeland to settle in the 13 colonies.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>While emigration from England declined, arrivals from Scotland and Germany soared. As a result, the colonial population became increasingly diverse.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Enlightenment was an eighteenth century intellectual movement led by a group of English and French thinkers and writers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>At first, the Atlantic Ocean posed a formidable barrier that hindered communication between England and her North American colonies. However, as the frequency of transatlantic crossings increased, ships carried more than just goods and people. They also carried a flow of information that included pamphlets and letters written by leading Enlightenment figures.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Enlightened leaders formed a cosmopolitan “republic of letters” that included colonial leaders such as Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CORE BELIEFS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Enlightened thinkers rejected superstition, bigotry, and intolerance. They stressed instead humans’ ability to become educated and to use reason to understand nature and improve society.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Enlightened thinkers believed that reason could be used to discover laws of economics and government that would improve society and make progress inevitable.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Enlightened thinkers accepted John Locke’s argument that every person was entitled to enjoy natural rights that included life, liberty, and property. The doctrine of natural rights implied a right to change governments that failed to protect a person’s life, liberty, and property.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Under feudalism, social relationships were considered hierarchical and static. Likewise, under the Navigation Acts, the relationship between the colonies and Great Britain was a static one. In contrast, Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke viewed static relationships as inherently <em>un</em>natural and therefore they advocated individual political rights, which in turn would lead (at least theoretically) to economic and social mobility.</p>
