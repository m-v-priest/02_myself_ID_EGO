<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>To his legion of admirers, Andrew Jackson provided an example of what an able and ambitious man born without privileges might become.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson was born in 1767 to a family of poor Scotch-Irish immigrants living in the back country of North Carolina. Forced to make his own way in life, Jackson moved to Tennessee where he became a lawyer and a successful land speculator.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Although he was a man of uncommon ability, Jackson nonetheless projected a common touch. He became Tennessee’s first representative in Congress and also served the state in the Senate.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson won his greatest acclaim as a military hero. He defeated the Creek Indians and triumphed over the British at the Battle of New Orleans. He earned the nickname “Old Hickory” because he seemed as tough as the hardest of American hardwood trees.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ELECTION OF 1828</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The First Party System provided political stability by allowing peaceful transfers of power from one set of elite leaders to another. Because of property qualifications, very few white males—and no women, enslaved Africans, or Native Americans—actually voted.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1820s, state legislatures eliminated most property qualifications enabling a growing number of white males to vote. Led by Martin Van Buren, Jackson’s supporters shrewdly launched a new style of campaigning that included parades, mass rallies, leaflets, barbecues, and, of course, kissing babies.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The 1828 presidential election featured a rematch between Jackson and John Quincy Adams. One passionate pro-Jackson newspaper editor captured the spirit of partisan politics by urging voters, “To the polls, to the polls! Let no one stay home. Let not a vote be lost.” The appeal worked. Jackson swept the South and West and <span id="page_76"/>easily crushed Adams in both the popular and the electoral vote. His victory began a new era in American history.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Jacksonians had great respect for the common sense and abilities of the common man.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Admirers saw Jackson as a common man who represented the interests of the people.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>EXPANDED SUFFRAGE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Jacksonians enthusiastically supported the expansion of white male suffrage.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the Federalist Era, caucuses of party leaders selected candidates. During the Jackson administration, nominating conventions replaced legislative caucuses.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>PATRONAGE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Jacksonians supported patronage—the policy of rewarding political supporters with government positions.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Many Jacksonians believed that victorious candidates had a duty to reward their supporters and punish their opponents.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>OPPOSITION TO PRIVILEGED ELITES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As champions of the common man, the Jacksonians despised the special privileges of the Eastern elites.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Special privileges were anathema to a government dedicated to promoting and protecting the common man.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE TARIFF OF ABOMINATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Tariffs traditionally served the dual purposes of raising revenue and protecting American industry from European competitors. For example, the 1816 tariff averaged 25 percent of the value <span id="page_77"/>of imported goods. In 1828, Congress unexpectedly passed a protective tariff that pushed rates to over 50 percent of the value of imports.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Led by South Carolina, the Southern states branded the hated law the “Tariff of Abominations.” Planters argued that while the industrial Northeast flourished, the South was forced to sell its cotton in an unprotected world market and buy imported goods at exorbitant rates.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>JOHN C. CALHOUN AND THE DOCTRINE OF NULLIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Vice President John C. Calhoun anonymously responded to the Tariff of Abominations by writing the “South Carolina Exposition and Protest.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Calhoun drew upon states’ rights arguments first formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. Insisting that the Union was a compact of sovereign states, Calhoun argued that when a federal law exceeded the delegated powers of Congress, a state or states could declare the law “null and void” within their own borders.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>JACKSON AND THE FORCE BILL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Inspired by Calhoun, the South Carolina legislature adopted an ordinance of nullification repudiating the Tariff of Abominations.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson angrily denounced nullification as an “impractical absurdity” and warned South Carolina that “disunion by armed force is treason.” He then demanded that Congress pass a “Force Bill” authorizing him to use the army to enforce federal laws in South Carolina.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>As tensions mounted, Henry Clay proposed a new compromise tariff that would gradually reduce duties over the next ten years. The compromise worked and South Carolina rescinded its nullification ordinance.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: NULLIFICATION AND SECESSION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Calhoun did not advocate secession. Instead, he saw nullification as a viable option that would prevent disunion.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson may have sensed that he had not gone far enough in suppressing nullification. On his deathbed in 1845 he bitterly regretted that he had not executed Calhoun for treason. “My country,” he said, “would have sustained me in the act, and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come.”</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_78"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson’s intuition proved to be prescient. During the 1850s, South Carolina “fire eaters” abandoned nullification and increasingly embraced the doctrine of secession as the best way to remedy their grievances.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE INDIAN REMOVAL ACT, 1830</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the late 1820s, approximately 125,000 Native Americans lived east of the Mississippi River. Although many Americans felt respect and admiration for the Indians, covetous white settlers surrounded their ancestral lands.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act providing for the exchange of Indian lands in the East for government lands in the newly-established Indian Territory in what is today Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong><em>WORCESTER v. GEORGIA</em>, 1832</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Cherokee legally challenged President Jackson’s removal order. In <em>Worcester v. Georgia</em>, Chief Justice John Marshall upheld the Cherokee Nation’s legal right to their land.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Supreme Court is dependent upon the President to enforce its decisions. As a famous Indian fighter, Jackson harbored a well-known animosity toward Native Americans. He responded to the <em>Worcester</em> decision by defiantly declaring, “John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE TRAIL OF TEARS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson defied the Court’s decision and pushed forward with his policy of moving the remaining eastern tribes west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1838, about 7,000 troops led by General Winfield Scott began the forcible evacuation of some 17,000 Cherokee from their homes. About one-fourth of the Cherokees died from disease and exhaustion on an 800-mile route that came to be known as the Trail of Tears.</p>

<p class="C568"><strong><em>The Trail of Tears has generated a number of APUSH exam questions.

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>JACKSON’S VETO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Second Bank of the United States included a main office in Philadelphia and 25 branches in cities across the nation. Jackson and his supporters assailed the bank as a “monster” that concentrated special financial advantages in the hands of a few privileged people.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The bank’s 20-year charter was scheduled to expire in 1836. In July 1832, Jackson vetoed a bill that would have rechartered the bank. He denounced the bank as a vehicle used by “the rich and powerful to bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson’s war against the bank played a key role in the creation of the new two-party system. Now known as the Democrats, Jackson’s party opposed the bank. In contrast, a new party known as the Whigs (which included many former Federalists) supported the bank.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Without the bank’s restraining policies, state-chartered banks flourished. Often poorly managed by inexperienced officials, these so-called “pet banks” flooded the country with paper currency, thus promoting a speculative bubble in western lands and transportation projects.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The South Carolina nullification crisis, the Indian Removal Act, and the battle over the national bank all provoked contentious national disputes.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Political opponents led by Henry Clay hated Jackson. They derisively called him “King Andrew the First” pointing to his dubious distinction of using the veto power more than all the previous presidents combined.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson’s rival left the Democratic Party and drew together in the newly-formed Whig Party.</p>

<p class="C568"><strong><em><span id="page_80"/>APUSH exams typically include 2 to 3 political cartoons. Be sure to examine the famous cartoon entitled “King Andrew The First.” The cartoonist’s point of view is that Jackson is an arbitrary ruler whose political actions are unconstitutional.

Jackson’s policies led to the formation of the Whig party and the beginning of the Second Party System</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ELECTION OF 1836</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1836, the Democratic convention nominated Jackson’s loyal Vice President, Martin Van Buren, for the presidency.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Still not fully organized, the Whigs did not hold a convention. Instead, they ran three candidates, hoping to throw the election into the House of Representatives. The strategy failed as Van Buren won a solid electoral victory.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: THE IMPACT OF HARD TIMES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Van Buren’s campaign benefitted from an economic boom that had created great prosperity during Jackson’s second term. But just two months after he took office, a sudden drop in cotton prices combined with a failure of the wheat crop created a financial panic. As hard times quickly spread, states cancelled transportation projects and many of the new pet banks failed. The financial panic settled into a deep depression as wages fell and unemployment rose. The economic depression doomed Van Buren’s presidency.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Like Van Buren, Herbert Hoover’s 1928 presidential campaign benefitted from a prolonged but vulnerable economic boom. Just six months after he took office, a sudden collapse of stock prices created a financial panic that swept through the American economy. Hard times spread quickly as banks closed, businesses failed, and unemployment soared. The impact of hard times doomed Hoover’s presidency as it had that of Van Buren a century before.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE LOG CABIN CAMPAIGN OF 1840</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Feeling that they had no other choice, the Democrats once again turned to Van Buren as their presidential standard bearer.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_81"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Sensing victory, the Whigs nominated William Henry Harrison of Ohio. They emphasized his victory over the Indians in the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe and blamed “Van Ruin” for the continuing economic slump. The strategy worked as Harrison and his running mate, John Tyler, won 234 electoral votes against just 40 for Van Buren.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Harrison’s election marked a triumph for a new democratic style of running political campaigns. Although Harrison’s father was a prominent Virginia planter who signed the Declaration of Independence, the Whigs adopted the log cabin and hard cider as campaign symbols to connect with the common man. Many historians consider the “log cabin and hard cider” campaign of 1840 the first “modern” election because both parties actively campaigned among the voting masses.</p>
