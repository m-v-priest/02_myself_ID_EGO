<p class="C337"><strong><span id="page_vi"/>A LETTER FROM OUR AUTHOR</strong></p>
<p class="C338">The first four editions of <em>AP</em><strong>®</strong> <em>U.S. History Crash Course</em> blazed a new trail in AP<strong>®</strong> test prep. As an experienced APUSH teacher, I chose not to write a book containing an endless catalog of names, dates, places, people, and events. Instead, I focused on a predictable set of topics that generated most of the exam questions. This strategy worked, as readers achieved high exam scores.</p>
<p class="C339"><strong>A REVISED FRAMEWORK AND EXAM</strong></p>
<p class="C338">After a lengthy process of evaluation and review, the College Board released a new APUSH Framework along with a redesigned APUSH exam that debuted in 2016. The new Framework includes a detailed 25-page “Concept Outline” covering 9 periods from 1491 to the present. With the release of the <em>2019–2020 Course and Exam Description</em>, the College Board further refined and clarified the scope of the course and exam.</p>
<p class="C338">Today’s APUSH course is more than just a chronological sequence of required topics. A careful analysis of all the released exam questions reveals that the test-taker should no longer rely on knowing only isolated facts. Instead, questions now test a specific and predictable set of historical thinking skills. These skills include the ability to make meaningful connections between different historical developments and to evaluate the impact and importance of key turning point events and movements.</p>
<p class="C339"><strong>THE UNIQUE CRASH COURSE APPROACH</strong></p>
<p class="C338">The College Board’s shift from a fact-driven exam based upon a brief topical outline to a skill-driven exam based upon a detailed concept outline required a new <em>Crash Course</em> approach. As always, my mission is to help you excel on the APUSH exam. I am very proud to tell you that this new 5th edition includes the following unique features:</p>
<p class="C341"><strong>1<span class="C344">.</span>Selective Content</strong></p>
<p class="C345">The 5th edition is carefully aligned with the Framework’s Concept Outline. If a topic is in the Concept Outline, I cover it; if it isn’t in the Concept Outline, I omit it. As a result, you will find detailed coverage of expected topics such as the Chesapeake and New England colonies as well as unexpected topics such as the British West Indian colonies. But you will not find a discussion of the Great Recession of 2009 or the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p class="C341"><strong><span id="page_vii"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Native American, African American, and Women’s History</strong></p>
<p class="C345">The history of Native Americans, African Americans, and American women continues to generate a significant number of exam questions. <a href="10_Chapter_3_A_New_World.html#page_19">Chapters 3</a> through <a href="46_Chapter_31_Key_Events_and_Trends.html#page_291">31</a> devote special attention to the key leaders and milestone events in the history of these groups. For example, you will find detailed sections that describe Native American cultural regions (<a href="10_Chapter_3_A_New_World.html#page_19">Chapter 3</a>), compare the goals of Dr. King and Malcolm X (<a href="42_Chapter_28_The_1960s.html#page_255">Chapter 28</a>), and evaluate the role of women in the Progressive movement (<a href="34_Chapter_21_Populists_and_Progres.html#page_171">Chapter 21</a>).</p>
<p class="C341"><strong>3<span class="C344">.</span>Important Historic Connections</strong></p>
<p class="C345">This edition also includes 48 special “Making Connections” features designed to help you answer multiple-choice comparison questions and earn the complexity point on the DBQ and Long-Essay questions. For example, the Making Connections feature in <a href="15_Chapter_6_Severing_Ties_with_Gre.html#page_41">Chapter 6</a> connects the Stamp Act Boycott with the Montgomery Bus Boycott.</p>
<p class="C341"><strong>4<span class="C344">.</span>Key Turning Points</strong></p>
<p class="C345">The majority of Long-Essay questions have used turning points in American history to test the skill of causation. This edition includes 12 detailed sections on key turning points in American history. You will find predictable turning points such as the Missouri Compromise (<a href="19_Chapter_9_The_Early_Republic.html#page_67">Chapter 9</a>) and <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (<a href="41_Chapter_27_The_Eisenhower_Era.html#page_243">Chapter 27</a>), and unexpected ones such as the transcontinental railroads (<a href="30_Chapter_18_The_New_West.html#page_143">Chapter 18</a>) and the 1960s counterculture (<a href="42_Chapter_28_The_1960s.html#page_255">Chapter 28</a>).</p>
<p class="C341"><strong>5<span class="C344">.</span>Test Tips</strong></p>
<p class="C345">Each of the 29 content chapters contains 2 new Test Tips. This popular feature alerts you to topics that have the potential to generate exam questions. For example, a Test Tip in <a href="40_Chapter_26_Truman__the_Cold_War.html#page_231">Chapter 26</a> points out that the First and Second Red Scares have generated more exam questions than any other specific topic.</p>
<p class="C345">On the first day of my APUSH class, I always tell my students that I have two primary goals. First, I strive to present an enjoyable and stimulating course. And second, I strive to teach the content and skills that will help everyone excel on the APUSH exam. This book is inspired by these same two goals!</p>
