<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>LINCOLN’S TEN PERCENT PLAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Abraham Lincoln led the United States through a long and bloody Civil War. When the conflict finally ended, Lincoln faced the daunting challenge of overcoming Southern resentment, restoring the Union, and determining the meaning of black freedom.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Lincoln’s Ten Percent Plan proposed a generous settlement. He offered a full pardon (except for high-ranking Confederate leaders) to Southerners who pledged loyalty to the Union and to the Constitution. Southern states in which 10 percent of the 1860 electorate took such an oath and accepted emancipation would be restored to the Union.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Lincoln concluded his Second Inaugural Address by promising “malice toward none, with charity for all.” We will never know if Lincoln could have fulfilled his inspiring pledge. On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth assassinated Lincoln while the president was watching a play at Ford’s Theatre in Washington.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Ratified on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment formally abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Lincoln believed that the freedmen should receive suffrage because their military contribution during the Civil War “demonstrated in blood their right to the ballot.” Lincoln felt confident that the states would fulfill this important responsibility.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>JOHNSON’S PLAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Lincoln’s tragic death placed the burden of reconstructing the South on the untested shoulders of his former Vice President, Andrew Johnson.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson favored a swift return to political and racial normalcy. Like Lincoln, he offered amnesty to most Confederates who took an oath of loyalty to the Union. Whites in each Southern state <span id="page_130"/>could then elect delegates to a state convention. A state could reenter the Union when its convention repealed all secession laws, repudiated Confederate debts, and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson did not support racial equality. His idea of racial normalcy was grounded in a firm belief in white supremacy. Declaring, “White men alone must manage the South,” Johnson stood aside as former rebels regained political power across the South.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE BLACK CODES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Slavery left an entrenched legacy of prejudice and discrimination that would be difficult to eliminate. Unwilling to accept blacks as equals, Southern legislatures enacted laws known as Black Codes to limit the freedmen’s basic civil and economic rights.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Black Codes continued the legal distinction between whites and blacks. For example, laws barred blacks from carrying weapons, marrying whites, assembling in groups, serving on juries, and pursuing any occupation other than agricultural work.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1866</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Johnson did not object to the Black Codes. His lenient view of Reconstruction placed the president on a collision course with Congress.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, Radical Republicans insisted on protecting the basic rights of the newly-freed blacks. Congress promptly passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 declaring that blacks were American citizens who had the same rights as whites.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson stunned Congress by vetoing the bill, claiming it was an unwarranted extension of federal power that would “foment discord among the races.” Johnson’s veto infuriated the Republicans who successfully overrode his veto. The struggle over the Black Codes and the Civil Rights Act marked the beginning of a contest of wills between Johnson and Congress.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Republican majority in Congress feared that Johnson would not enforce the Civil Rights Act. They also worried that the courts would declare the law unconstitutional. These concerns prompted <span id="page_131"/>Congress to pass the Fourteenth Amendment in June 1866. Many constitutional scholars believe the Fourteenth Amendment is the most important addition to the Constitution since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Fourteenth Amendment defines national citizenship for the first time as extending to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The amendment gave the federal government responsibility for guaranteeing equal rights under the law to all Americans. The amendment prohibited the states from depriving “any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Making Connections: The Incorporation Doctrine</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The Founders wrote the Bill of Rights to restrict the powers of the new national government. For example, the First Amendment begins by stating, “Congress shall make no laws . . .” Prior to the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled that the Bill of Rights restrained only the national government, not states and cities.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>In the 1925 <em>Gitlow v. New York</em> decision, the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of speech and press “were fundamental personal rights and liberties protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the states.” This landmark decision began the development of the incorporation doctrine, the legal concept under which the Supreme Court has nationalized the Bill of Rights, by making most of its provisions applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OF 1867</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Fourteenth Amendment intensified the struggle for power between President Johnson and Congress. Saying that blacks were unfit to receive “the coveted prize” of citizenship, Johnson campaigned for Congressional candidates who supported his policies. His strategy backfired. Voters repudiated the president by giving his Republican opponents a solid two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The victorious Republicans promptly passed the Reconstruction Act of 1867 eliminating the state governments created by Johnson’s plan. It divided the South into five military districts, each under the command of a Union general. In order to be readmitted into the Union, a state had to approve the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_132"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson vetoed the Reconstruction Act thus deepening his growing rift with Congress. Firmly in control of Capitol Hill, the Republicans overrode his veto.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE IMPEACHMENT CRISIS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Congress escalated the struggle for power by passing the Tenure of Office Act. It required Senate consent for the removal of any official whose appointment had required Senate confirmation. Convinced the law was unconstitutional, Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a leading Radical Republican ally.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson’s provocative action prompted the Radical Republicans to pass a resolution declaring that the president should be impeached. On February 24, 1868, the Republican-dominated House of Representatives impeached Johnson for “high crimes and misdemeanors in office,” which included violating the Tenure of Office Act. After a tense trial, the Senate failed to convict Johnson by one vote.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Although Johnson escaped conviction, the trial crippled his presidency. Ten months later, voters sent the Union war hero Ulysses S. Grant to the White House. The Republicans completed their overwhelming victory by retaining two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Fifteenth Amendment marked the last of the three Reconstruction Amendments. Ratified on February 3, 1870, it forbade either the federal government or the states from denying citizens the right to vote on the basis of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Taken together, the three Reconstruction Amendments constitute what modern historians call a “Second Founding.” The Republicans who wrote these amendments believed that the new constitutional provisions would fully protect the newly-freed slaves by granting them the liberties and legal equality promised in the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Making Connections: Women’s Suffrage</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The Fifteenth Amendment left leading women’s rights activists feeling outraged and abandoned. They angrily demanded to know why Congress granted the suffrage to ex-slaves and not to women. Julia Ward Howe and other leaders of the women’s suffrage movement finally accepted that this was “the Negro’s hour.” However, both Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton actively opposed passage of the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426"><span id="page_133"/>b.</span>During the early 1900s, the Progressive movement sharpened the nation’s social conscience and motivated a new generation of suffragists. Led by Carrie Chapman Catt and Alice Paul, women organized rallies, signed petitions, and demonstrated in public marches. Their campaign of mounting pressure finally became irresistible. On June 4, 1919, Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment stating that no citizen could be denied the right to vote “on account of sex.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>RADICAL REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The period when Republicans ruled the South is called Radical Reconstruction. The word “radical” underscores the Republicans’ attempt to transform the South by extending civil and political equality to African Americans.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Fifteenth Amendment enabled African Americans to exercise political influence for the first time. This produced a significant change in voting patterns and office holding in the South. Freedmen provided about 80 percent of Republican votes in the South. Over 600 blacks served as state legislators in the new state governments. In addition, voters elected 14 blacks to the House of Representatives and 2 to the Senate. Black voters supported the Republican Party by loyally casting votes that helped elect Grant in 1868 and reelect him in 1872.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Republicans launched an ambitious program of reforms. They started a public school system that included about 600,000 black students. They also built new hospitals and orphanages and began to reform the criminal justice system. Republican officials raised taxes to finance the construction of roads, bridges, and railroad lines.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: BLACK COLLEGES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The growth of educational opportunities also led to the founding of a number of black colleges including Howard University in Washington, D.C., Morehouse College and Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, and Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_134"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>These historically black colleges later played a crucial role in training African American leaders who led the fight against segregation. For example, W.E.B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells attended Fisk, Thurgood Marshall and Stokely Carmichael attended Howard, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., attended Morehouse.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CRITICISM OF RECONSTRUCTION IN THE SOUTH</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Critics complained that the new Republican state governments misused public funds by accepting absurdly high bids for contracts. In addition, Democrats charged that corrupt Republican politicians accepted kickbacks and bribes from construction and railroad companies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>White Southerners reserved their greatest scorn for carpetbaggers and scalawags. Carpetbaggers were Northerners who supposedly packed their belongings in a carpetbag suitcase and then headed south to seek power and profit. The much-maligned scalawags were Southerners who “betrayed” the South by supporting and then benefitting from Radical Republican policies.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: THE END OF RECONSTRUCTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>“Slavery is not honestly dead.”</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>In 1869, members of the American Antislavery Society gathered to celebrate the abolition of slavery, passage of the Reconstruction Amendments, and the beginning of racial justice in the South. Frederick Douglass, however, did not share their optimism. He warned his listeners that “slavery is not honestly dead.” Douglass pointed out that slavery did not die because of moral convictions; it died because of overwhelming military force in a bloody civil war.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Douglass’s insight proved to be prescient. Two centuries of slavery created deeply rooted racial prejudices that Constitutional amendments could not eradicate. White Southerners bitterly resented Republican governments that repealed Black Codes and guaranteed voting rights to African Americans.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Ku Klux Klan</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The Ku Klux Klan began in Tennessee in 1866 and then quickly spread across the South. The Klan sought to maintain white supremacy by aiding the revival of the Democratic Party and by overthrowing of Radical Republicans.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426"><span id="page_135"/>b.</span>Anonymous Klansmen dressed in white robes and pointed cowls burned black homes, schools, and churches and committed hundreds of murders. The Klan lynched as many as 400 African Americans between 1868 and 1871.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>The Klan’s reign of terror worked. Political intimidation and violence helped weaken Republican governments. By 1876, Democrats replaced Republicans as governors and state legislators in eight of the eleven former Confederate states. Only South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida remained under Republican control.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Erosion of Northern Support</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Radical Republicans had long been the driving force behind the program to reconstruct Southern society. Sympathy for the freedmen began to wane as these leaders died or left office. A new generation of “politicos” began to focus their attention on Western expansion, Indian wars, tariffs, and the construction of transcontinental railroads.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>President Grant showed little enthusiasm for Reconstruction. His administration soon became distracted by scandals. In addition, a business panic in 1873 followed by a crippling economic depression further undermined public support for Reconstruction.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Compromise of 1877</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The presidential election of 1876 created a potential constitutional crisis when Democratic candidate Samuel Tilden won the popular vote over his Republican rival Rutherford B. Hayes. However, the outcome remained unclear because of disputed electoral votes from three Southern states.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Congress created an electoral commission to determine which candidate would receive the disputed electoral votes. As tensions mounted, Democrat and Republican leaders reached an agreement known as the Compromise of 1877. The Democrats agreed to support Hayes. In return, Hayes and the Republicans agreed to withdraw all federal troops from the South, appoint at least one Southerner to the cabinet, and grant federal funds for internal improvements in the South.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>The Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction. Republican governments in Louisiana and South Carolina quickly collapsed as Southern Democrats proclaimed a return to “home rule” and white supremacy.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>HENRY GRADY’S VISION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Henry Grady, editor of the <em>Atlanta Constitution</em>, called for a “New South” that would be home to thriving cities, bustling factories, and rewarding business opportunities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Grady inspired a new generation of Southern leaders who strove to fulfill his vision of building a more diversified Southern economy.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE INDUSTRIAL SOUTH</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Investors recognized that the South’s ready supply of cheap labor, low taxes, and proximity to vast cotton fields created ideal conditions for building a profitable textile industry. Cotton mills soon flourished in small towns across the Piedmont region of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. By 1900, the South had about 400 cotton mills employing 100,000 workers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>James Buchanan Duke launched one of the South’s great industrial successes when he founded the American Tobacco Company. By 1900, Duke’s company produced 80 percent of the cigarettes manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1870s and ’80s, Birmingham, Alabama, quickly became a major industrial center and manufacturing hub. The city’s thriving iron and steel mills led boosters to proclaim their city “The Pittsburgh of the South.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE LIMITS OF DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Despite pockets of industrial development, Grady’s dream of a diversified Southern economy remained elusive.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1900, two-thirds of all Southern men still earned their living in farming. At that time, the average income in the South was only 40 percent of that in the North.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>DEPENDENCE UPON COTTON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Cotton continued to be the South’s most important cash crop. Between 1870 and 1900, the number of acres devoted to cotton production doubled as production soared to almost 10 million bales.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_137"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Southern economy became increasingly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global price of cotton. During the 1890s, a global glut of cotton caused a 50 percent drop in prices that shook the Southern economy as debts and unemployment rose.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SHARECROPPING</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Cotton planters continued to own most of the land, while landless blacks were forced to sell their labor. During the 1860s, cotton planters and blacks formed a new labor system called sharecropping. Under this arrangement, blacks (and some whites) exchanged their labor for the use of land, tools, and seed. The croppers typically gave the landowner half of the crop as payment for using his property.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In addition to beginning with a debt to the landowner, sharecroppers had to borrow food, clothing, and other supplies from local storekeepers. These merchants then took a lien or mortgage on the crops.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>A CYCLE OF DEBT AND POVERTY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Sharecropping did not lead to economic independence. Facing interest rates as high as 50 percent, sharecroppers became entrapped in a seemingly endless cycle of debt and poverty.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Sharecropping offered little hope for black or white tenants. During the 1890s, the problem of perpetual debt produced a harvest of discontent that led to the formation of farmers’ alliances and the beginning of the black migration out of the South.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE REDEEMERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The end of Reconstruction left political control in the South in the hands of a group of white Democratic Party leaders known collectively as “Redeemers” because they “redeemed” or saved the region from Republican rule.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Redeemers included merchants, financiers, and politicians who promoted economic growth based upon industrialization and railroad expansion. At the same time, they also supported policies intended to restore a social system based upon white supremacy.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF BLACK VOTERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Fifteenth Amendment prohibited states from denying anyone the right to vote because of race. Redeemer governments used <span id="page_138"/>literacy tests and poll taxes to evade the amendment. For example, poll taxes ranged from $1.00 in Georgia to $3.00 in Florida. Voters who skipped an election found that the tax accumulated from one election to the next.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Redeemers’ tactics worked. During the 1890s, the number of black voters plummeted. For example, in 1896, 130,000 blacks were registered to vote in Louisiana. Just four years later the number plunged to 5,320. By the early 1900s, African Americans had effectively lost their political rights in the South.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>“SEPARATE BUT EQUAL”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Civil Rights Act of 1875 guaranteed blacks “full and equal enjoyment” of public facilities. As more and more white Southerners rejected the idea of racial equality, Southern towns and companies began to enact Jim Crow laws mandating racial segregation in public facilities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In the 1883 <em>Civil Rights Cases,</em> the Supreme Court ruled that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only applied to state action and could not be used to regulate the behavior of private individuals or private organizations.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1896, the Supreme Court carried the logic of legal segregation a significant step further. In <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, the Court upheld segregation by approving “separate but equal” railroad facilities for African Americans.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span><em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> allowed Jim Crow segregation laws to spread across the South. Within a few years, state and local statutes required segregated schools, restaurants, and hotels. Ubiquitous signs mandating “Whites only” or “Colored” appeared on restroom doors, above water fountains, and inside stores.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: SEGREGATED PUBLIC SCHOOLS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span><em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> sanctioned a pattern of court-supported segregation that lasted almost 60 years. Segregated schools in the South were consistently inferior and underfunded compared with schools attended by white students.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1954, the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, overturned <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>. Basing its decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court concluded that “in the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” The decision <span id="page_139"/>helped galvanize the modern Civil Rights Movement. Led by Dr. King, civil rights activists began to demand “Freedom Now!”</p>

Many chose to “walk a quiet life” shielded by a mask of public deference. Excluded from the dominant white society, African Americans increasingly turned to black churches as centers of community life.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The resurgence of racism forced African American leaders to speak out. Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois offered very different approaches to finding a place in Southern society.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>BOOKER T. WASHINGTON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Believed that white racism was a consequence of slavery.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Advocated black economic self-help. Washington called upon African Americans to master trades. He believed that economic progress would earn white respect and gradually overcome racism.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Supported accommodation to white society. In his Atlanta Compromise Speech, Washington offered a conciliatory approach welcomed by his white audience: “In all things purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Supported vocational education. Washington helped found Tuskegee Institute in Alabama to provide industrial education for African American students.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Opposed public political agitation to challenge Jim Crow segregation. Washington recognized that African Americans faced a wall of discrimination that could only be overcome by gradual and patient progress. He believed that political rights would follow economic success.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>W.E.B. DU BOIS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Believed white racism was the cause of slavery and the primary reason why African Americans were forced into a subordinate position in American society.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_140"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Advocated the intellectual development of a “talented tenth” of the African American population. The talented tenth would become a vanguard of influential leaders who would fight for social change.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Supported legal action to oppose Jim Crow segregation. Du Bois helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The NAACP adopted a strategy of using lawsuits in federal courts to fight Jim Crow segregation.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Opposed Booker T. Washington’s policy of gradualism and accommodation. In <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em>, Du Bois called upon African Americans to “insist continually, in season and out of season, that voting is necessary to modern manhood, that color discrimination is barbarism, and that black boys need education as well as white boys.”</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Believed that economic success would only be possible if African Americans first won political rights. Du Bois therefore advocated a strategy of “ceaseless agitation” and litigation to achieve equal rights.</p>
