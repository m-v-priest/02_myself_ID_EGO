<p class="C349"><strong>STRATEGIES FOR THE LONG-ESSAY QUESTION</strong></p>
<p class="C373">After completing the DBQ, you will yearn for a break to rest your tired writing hand. Unfortunately, there is no break. Instead, you must be resolute and focus on the next and final APUSH challenge: the long-essay question.</p>
<p class="C373">The long-essay section will ask you to examine three questions focusing on the same historical thinking skill. Fortunately, you only have to answer ONE of the questions. You will have 40 minutes to write your essay.</p>
<p class="C373">Your long essay can earn up to 6 rubric points. Each point is worth 3.5 exam points. So a perfect score of 6 is worth 21 points or 15 percent of your total exam score. It is important to remember that earning 4 of the 6 possible rubric points will keep you on pace to earn an overall score of 5 on your APUSH exam.</p>
<p class="C337"><strong>THE LONG-ESSAY SCORING RUBRIC</strong></p>
<p class="C373">The APUSH long-essay scoring rubric is divided into the following four categories:</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>1<span class="C344">.</span>THESIS — 1 POINT</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes your basic argument.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Consists of one or more sentences located in one place, either the introduction or the conclusion.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>2<span class="C344">.</span>CONTEXTUALIZATION — 1 POINT</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Places the prompt in its proper historic setting.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Connects the prompt to broader historical events or trends occurring before or during the prompt’s time frame.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong><span id="page_340"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>EVIDENCE — 2 POINTS</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Provides specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt (1 point).</p>
<p class="C513"><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Supports the argument with specific and relevant examples of evidence (2 points).</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>4<span class="C344">.</span>ANALYSIS AND REASONING: HISTORICAL REASONING — 1 POINT</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Uses historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument by addressing one of the following targeted historical thinking skills: comparison, causation, or continuity and change over time (1 point).</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>For the skill of <em>comparison</em> you can earn one point by describing similarities and differences among historic individuals, developments, or processes.</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>For the skill of <em>causation</em> you can earn one point for describing the causes and/or effects of a historical event, development, or process.</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>For the skill of <em>continuity and change over time</em> you can earn one point for describing historical continuity and/or historic change over time.</p>
<p class="C513"><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p>
<p class="C496"><strong>4<span class="C344">A.</span>ANALYSIS AND REASONING: COMPLEXITY — 2 POINTS</strong></p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Demonstrates a <em>complex understanding</em> of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt using evidence to corroborate (reinforce), qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question (2 points).</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Complex understanding can be accomplished in a variety of ways including:</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>explaining both similarities and differences, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects;</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods;</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes;</p>
<p class="C498"><span class="C499">—</span>qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative viewpoints or evidence.</p>
<p class="C337"><strong><span id="page_341"/>THREE QUESTIONS COVERING THREE DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS</strong></p>
<p class="C373">The long-essay section will provide you with three long-essay questions. DON’T PANIC! You will only be asked to select and answer ONE of the questions.</p>
<p class="C373">Your exam will contain one question dealing with periods 1–3, one question dealing with periods 4–6, and one question dealing with periods 7–9. The three questions will all address the same theme and reasoning skill (i.e., comparison, causation, or continuity and change over time).</p>
<p class="C337"><strong>A SAMPLE ANNOTATED LONG ESSAY</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Practice is the key to performing well on the long essay. The following sample long essay is designed to illustrate how to use a guided set of five strategies that can be applied to any long-essay question.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>1<span class="C344">.</span>BEGIN BY CAREFULLY ANALYZING THE ASSIGNMENT AND MAKING A PRAGMATIC CHOICE.</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Your first task is to select which one of the three long answer questions you want to write about. Here are three long-essay questions that test the historical thinking skill continuity and change over time:</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Evaluate the extent to which the Constitution fostered political and social change in the United States from 1783 to 1800.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Evaluate the extent to which the Mexican-American War fostered political and social change in the United States from 1840 to 1860.</p>
<p class="C488"><span class="C494">•</span>Evaluate the extent to which the Supreme Court decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</em> fostered political and social change in the United States from 1954 to 1965.</p>
<p class="C373">Begin by taking about five minutes to evaluate the three questions. Above all, make a pragmatic choice. A common mistake many students make is to choose the question they find the most challenging. Avoid this pitfall. Always choose the question that you know the most about.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>2<span class="C344">.</span>BEGIN YOUR ESSAY WITH A CLEAR, WELL-DEVELOPED THESIS (1 POINT).</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Remember, a thesis statement is your position on the question. Writing a clear, well-developed thesis statement is essential to earning a high score on the long-essay question. Make sure that your thesis fully addresses the entire question.</p>
<p class="C373"><span id="page_342"/>Here is a clear and fully developed thesis statement for the first question: Evaluate the extent to which the Constitution fostered political and social change in the United States from 1783 to 1800.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>The Constitution created a new national government based upon the principle that sovereignty rests with the people not the states. This marked a momentous change in American political history. However, the changes in America’s political institutions were not matched by equally significant political and social changes for women, Native Americans, and enslaved Africans</em>.</p>
<p class="C373">This thesis statement provides what APUSH scoring commentaries call “a sophisticated thesis.” A “sophisticated thesis” is clear, defensible, and also nuanced. A <em>nuance</em> is a shade of difference. A one-dimensional thesis would simply state that political change dominated the period between 1783 and 1800. Our sample thesis is nuanced because it notes that <em>both</em> political changes and social continuities existed in this period. A nuanced thesis will enable you to present a complex understanding of the historic development that is the focus of the prompt.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>3<span class="C344">.</span>WRITE A CONTEXTUAL PARAGRAPH (1 POINT).</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Now that you have written a sophisticated thesis, your next step is to write a contextualization paragraph. <em>Contextualization</em> is a long word for a simple concept — it means describing key historic trends and events taking place just before or at the beginning of the time frame of the question.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>America’s victory in the Revolutionary War created a new nation with vast territory, a diverse and growing population, and a flawed national government. Ratified in 1781, the Articles of Confederation created a loose union among sovereign states. Designed to be a “firm league of friendship,” the government lacked a chief executive to enforce its laws and a judiciary to interpret them. The Articles did call for a unicameral Congress. However, it lacked the power to levy taxes, regulate commerce, and enforce unified economic policies. These weaknesses became glaringly apparent when Congress proved unable to raise a militia to suppress Shays’ Rebellion</em>.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>4<span class="C344">.</span>PROVIDE RELEVANT SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (2 POINTS).</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Your opening paragraph asserted a thesis and your second paragraph established its historic context. Your next step is to provide at least two examples of specific historic evidence that support your argument that political changes dominated the period from 1783 to 1800.</p>
<p class="C510"><em><span id="page_343"/>The nation’s chaotic economy and Shays’ Rebellion fueled dissatisfaction with the Articles of Confederation. On May 25, 1787, fifty-five delegates from twelve states gathered in Philadelphia to revive the Articles. However, the delegates quickly abandoned this limited objective and instead created a new national government</em>.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>The Framers successfully seized control of America’s political destiny. In a bold decision, they transformed sovereignty from the states to the people. For example, their decision to hold popular elections to select members of the House of Representatives marked an unprecedented expansion of democracy</em>.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>The new Constitution provided America with a flexible and enduring government that included an amendment process and a division of power among executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The new national government fostered a series of impressive political changes including Washington’s successful assertion of federal authority to quell the Whiskey Rebellion and the first peaceful transfer of power following the presidential election of 1800</em>.</p>
<p class="C353"><strong>5<span class="C344">.</span>DEMONSTRATE A COMPLEX UNDERSTANDING (2 POINTS).</strong></p>
<p class="C373">Your final task is to demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical developments that are the focus of the prompt. Complexity can be demonstrated in a number of ways. The following section begins by pointing out continuities in the status of women, Native Americans, and enslaved Africans. It concludes by asserting a sophisticated thesis and by providing insightful connections across American history.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>Although the Constitution marked the beginning of momentous political changes, it did not initiate the beginning of equally significant social changes. The Constitution’s opening words, “We the People,” did not extend the revolutionary rhetoric about equality to women, Native Americans, and enslaved Africans. Women did not obtain new rights as the Framers failed to “Remember the Ladies.” Native Americans were denied citizenship and continued to lose their lands and their autonomy. Enslaved Africans did benefit from emancipation laws in the North. However, over 90 percent of the slaves lived in the South where conditions did not change</em>.</p>
<p class="C510"><em>The continued discrimination against women, Native Americans, and enslaved Africans did not overshadow the historic changes launched by the new Constitution. The Framers <span id="page_344"/>successfully altered America’s political history. Although women, Native Americans, and enslaved Africans were initially excluded from the American political community, the institutions created by the Framers permitted long-term changes. The Fifteenth Amendment gave African Americans the right to vote and the Nineteenth Amendment extended the suffrage to women. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted citizenship to all Native Americans. Although belated, these actions demonstrate the Constitution’s ability to successfully foster political and social change</em>.</p>
