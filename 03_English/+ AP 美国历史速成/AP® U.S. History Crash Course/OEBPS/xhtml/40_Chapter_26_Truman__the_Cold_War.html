<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The United States emerged from the Second World War as the world’s most powerful and prosperous country. In 1947, America produced half of the world’s manufactured goods, 57 percent of its steel, 43 percent of its electricity, and 62 percent of its oil.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In contrast, the Soviet Union suffered heavy losses during the war. The Nazi invasion destroyed many Russian cities and claimed as many as 20 million lives.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The contrasting impact of World War II helps to explain why the United States and the Soviet Union acted differently after the war. While American leaders focused on building a peaceful and prosperous world order, Soviet leaders focused on building a buffer zone in Eastern Europe to protect their country from a future invasion.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE IRON CURTAIN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Soviet Union steadily tightened its grip on Eastern Europe. Directed by Stalin, the Red Army installed new pro-Russian governments. Across Eastern Europe, communist officials imprisoned opponents, censored newspapers, and established state-controlled radio stations. Guards patrolled the borders to prevent people from escaping.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Soviet actions alarmed Winston Churchill. In a 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri, he warned Americans that, “An Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.” No longer independent, the nations of Eastern Europe were fast becoming satellites controlled by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_232"/>C.</strong></span><strong>CONTAINMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Each report about the loss of freedom in Eastern Europe exacerbated tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. As the initial postwar spirit of optimism vanished, the two former allies became increasingly suspicious rivals.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace urged a policy of restraint. He argued that the Soviet Union had a legitimate right to control a sphere of influence along its western border. “Getting tough,” Wallace said, “never bought anything real and lasting—whether for schoolyard bullies or world powers. The tougher we get, the tougher the Russians will get.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>George Kennan, a leading expert on Soviet affairs, disagreed with Wallace. He predicted that the United States and the Soviet Union would remain antagonists for many years. Kennan pointed out that Soviet leaders espoused a communist ideology, or system of beliefs, convincing the Soviet people that “the outside world was hostile and that it was their duty eventually to overthrow the political forces beyond their borders.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>In an influential 1947 article published in <em>Foreign Affairs</em>, Kennan recommended that the United States adopt a policy of “long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment.” By containment, he meant adopting a strategic policy of blocking the expansion of Soviet influence.</p>
<div class="C565"><p class="C564"><img alt="" src="../img/30_1.jpg"/></p></div>
<p class="C568"><strong><em>Don’t neglect Henry Wallace’s call for a foreign policy of conciliation and restraint. Be prepared to compare and contrast how Wallace and Kennan viewed Soviet conduct</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The threat of Soviet expansion was not limited to Eastern Europe. In early 1947, Russian pressure threatened the independence of Greece and Turkey. Since World War II, these two nations had depended upon Great Britain for financial support. However, on February 21, 1947, the British delivered two notes to the U.S. State Department acknowledging that they lacked the resources to aid Greece and Turkey. An American official later noted, “Great Britain had within the hour handed the job of world leadership with all its burden and all its glory to the United States.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>President Truman accepted America’s new responsibility. On March 12, 1947, he addressed a joint session of Congress and asked for <span id="page_233"/>$400 million in military and economic aid to help Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Truman did not stop his address with a request for money. In what historian John Spanier calls “one of the most important speeches in American history,” Truman articulated a new foreign policy that became known as the Truman Doctrine. The president confidently announced, “I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugations by armed minorities or by outside pressure.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Congress overwhelmingly approved Truman’s request for funds to assist Greece and Turkey. American aid played a vital role in helping these two countries successfully resist Soviet pressure.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of the Cold War, a prolonged era of economic, political, technological, and ideological competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. As the leader of the Free World, the United States pledged to use its strength to limit the spread of communism throughout the world. This commitment to a policy of containment dominated American foreign policy from 1947 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE MARSHALL PLAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Greece and Turkey were not the only countries that needed aid. World War II left Western Europe in ruins. Homeless families struggled to survive in shattered cities. Devastated factories could not provide employment or produce badly needed goods.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Secretary of State George Marshall convinced President Truman that the United States had to act quickly. Speaking at Harvard University in June 1947, he proposed a bold plan to offer massive economic aid to help reconstruct Europe.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Marshall Plan committed $13 billion to help rebuild sixteen Western European countries. These desperately needed funds helped Western Europe stage a remarkable economic recovery. Within four years, industrial production within the region was 41 percent higher than it had been on the eve of World War II. The <span id="page_234"/>Marshall Plan thus accomplished its twin goals of reconstructing Western Europe and containing communism.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE NATO ALLIANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan represented the first two phases of America’s new containment policy. The third phase came in 1949 when the United States, Canada, and ten Western European nations formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty commits each member state to consider an attack against one member state to be an armed attack against them all. America’s decision to join an alliance based upon collective security marked a decisive break from its rejection of the League of Nations and its prewar policy of isolationism.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The NATO alliance escalated the Cold War. Stalin retaliated by forming the Warsaw Pact, an alliance linking the Soviet Union and seven Eastern European countries. Two hostile alliances now confronted each other across a divided continent.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE BERLIN AIRLIFT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1945, the Allies divided Germany into four occupation zones, one each for the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The city of Berlin lay 110 miles inside the Soviet occupation zone. Like Germany, it was divided into four occupation zones.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In June 1948, the United States, Great Britain, and France agreed to merge their occupation zones into a new German republic. Fearing a resurgent Germany, Stalin cut off Western highway and rail access to West Berlin. The 2.2 million people living in West Berlin had coal supplies for 45 days and enough food for just 36 days.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Berlin blockade represented the first great Cold War test of wills between the United States and the Soviet Union. If Truman withdrew from West Berlin, he would lose the city and undermine confidence in America’s policy of containment.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Truman refused to withdraw, declaring, “We are going to stay, period.” He surprised Stalin by ordering a massive airlift to supply the 4,500 tons of food and fuel Berliners needed each day. Recognizing that the blockade was failing, Stalin reopened access into West Berlin.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The Berlin Airlift had a number of important consequences. The constant roar of planes over Berlin provided a convincing <span id="page_235"/>demonstration of American power and will. The crisis changed the relationship between Germany and the Western Allies from that of occupiers and occupied, to partners in a joint struggle to defend the Free World. Following the Berlin Airlift, the Western Allies created the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany. Stalin responded by establishing the East German state, the German Democratic Republic.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: THE IMPORTANCE OF BERLIN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The success of the Berlin Airlift magnified West Berlin’s importance. As Germany’s largest city and former capital, Berlin had tremendous political and psychological significance. The stalemate over the status of West Berlin continued. In 1961, the Soviets surrounded the city with a 28-mile concrete wall designed to prevent East Germans from escaping to freedom in West Berlin. The Berlin Wall quickly became a symbol of the Cold War and Soviet oppression.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On November 9, 1989, the East German government yielded to popular pressure and opened the Berlin Wall. As the incredible news spread, the long-divided city erupted into joyous celebration. Jubilant Berliners danced, sang, and chanted, “The Wall is gone! The Wall is gone!” The fall of the Berlin Wall was a watershed event marking the end of the Cold War in Europe.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>A NEW JAPAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Truman placed General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Japanese occupation. Under MacArthur’s direction, Japan adopted a new constitution that created a democratic government. At the same time, American aid helped Japan rebuild factories, launch new electronic industries, and implement a program of land reform. By 1953, the Japanese economy was performing at prewar levels.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>MacArthur’s display of firm but fair leadership won the respect of the Japanese people. The United States and Japan gradually came to view each other as allies.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE FALL OF CHINA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>While the Japanese recovered, a civil war divided China. As World War II ended, conflict between the Nationalists led by Chiang <span id="page_236"/>Kai-shek and the Communists led by Mao Zedong spread across the country.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Despite massive American aid, Chiang’s forces steadily lost ground. An American military advisor reported that the Nationalist losses were due to “the world’s worst leadership” and “a complete loss of will to fight.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>On October 1, 1949, Mao triumphantly announced the birth of the People’s Republic of China. Meanwhile, Chiang and the remnants of his defeated army fled to Taiwan, an island 110 miles from the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>In early 1950, Mao signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union. Alarmed Americans viewed the Chinese Revolution as part of a menacing Communist monolith. The fall of China represented a bitter defeat for American Cold War diplomacy. The U.S. refused to establish diplomatic relations with Mao’s new government. Instead, Truman recognized the government of Taiwan as the representative of all China.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>A DIVIDED PENINSULA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Korea occupies a strategic peninsula that borders China and Russia and extends to within 100 miles of Japan. After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to temporarily divide Korea at the 38th parallel.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As Cold War tensions increased, the 38th parallel hardened into a permanent demarcation line. The Soviet Union supported a communist government in the north, while the United States supported a pro-Western government in the south.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FROM INVASION TO STALEMATE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On June 25, 1950, the North Korean army suddenly attacked South Korea. Supported by artillery and heavy tanks, about 90,000 North Korean soldiers smashed through the South Korean defenses and rolled south.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Truman saw the invasion as a test of containment and an opportunity to prove that Democrats were not “soft” on Communism. Rather than ask Congress for a declaration of war, Truman appealed to the United Nations to intervene. Taking advantage of a temporary Soviet boycott, the UN Security Council <span id="page_237"/>passed a resolution calling upon international assistance to aid South Korea. This marked the first time in history that a world organization mobilized to stop aggression.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE TRUMAN-MacARTHUR CONTROVERSY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Led by General Douglas MacArthur, the UN forces recaptured all of South Korea. In October 1950, MacArthur confidently crossed the 38th parallel in a bid to reunite the entire Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Chinese repeatedly warned that they would not “stand idly by” and permit a North Korean defeat, thus allowing an American military presence near China’s key industrial area in Manchuria. On November 25, China launched a massive counterattack catching MacArthur by surprise and driving the UN forces back into South Korea.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Truman now decided to abandon the goal of unifying Korea and instead adopted a policy of fighting a limited war to save South Korea. MacArthur indicated his disagreement in a public letter to the House Republican leader that concluded: “There is no substitute for victory.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>MacArthur’s open act of insubordination forced Truman to remove the general from all of his commands. This decisive action protected the principle of civilian control of the military.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>MacArthur’s dismissal did not prevent the Korean War from continuing for more than two years. The North Koreans finally signed an armistice providing for a cease-fire that left the border between the two Koreas at the 38th parallel.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF THE KOREAN WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Prior to the Korean War, U.S. policy had been limited to containing Soviet power in Western Europe and the Mediterranean. The Korean War expanded American involvement in Asia, transforming containment into a global struggle.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Truman’s decision to commit American troops without Congressional approval set a precedent for U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Korean War fueled a massive American rearmament program. The defense budget soared from $13 billion in 1950 to $50 billion in 1953. These expenditures boosted economic growth. However, they also led to an informal alliance of America’s military <span id="page_238"/>and defense industries that President Eisenhower later called the “military-industrial complex.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Prior to the Korean War, African Americans fought in segregated units. In July 1948, President Truman ordered the racial desegregation of the U.S. armed forces. The Korean War marked the first time American forces fought in integrated units.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The Korean War began and ended at the 38th parallel. Korea continues to be a tense and divided peninsula with no formal peace treaty. Approximately 30,000 American troops remain stationed at the 38th parallel to deter North Korean aggression.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: FEAR OF RADICALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A fear of radicalism has been a recurrent characteristic of American life and politics. During the 1790s, the Federalists exploited public distrust of aliens who supported France and criticized President Adams. During the 1850s, the Know-Nothings vehemently protested that Catholics posed a danger to America’s republican institutions. And following World War I, a Red Scare directed public frustration at radical labor unions, communist sympathizers, and alleged subversives.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This pattern of fear and anxiety directed at scapegoats erupted again during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The “loss” of China followed by a military stalemate in Korea shocked the country. Public apprehension deepened when the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb ending America’s nuclear monopoly. These stunning reversals triggered a wave of anxiety and fear known as the Second Red Scare.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE LOYALTY PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Truman vigorously rejected Republican charges that his administration was “soft” on communism. In March 1947, Truman issued an executive order creating a Federal Employee Loyalty program.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the next four years, government loyalty boards investigated over 3 million federal employees. The boards dismissed 490 government workers, but failed to uncover any cases of espionage. Reckless allegations of misconduct nonetheless ruined many once-promising careers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_239"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Congress created the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1938 to investigate foreign subversives. During the Second Red Scare, HUAC turned its attention from Nazis to possible communist influence in Hollywood.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1947, HUAC held two weeks of hearings designed to investigate the film industry. Scores of Hollywood executives and actors were forced to answer this accusatory question: “Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?” A group of ten writers and directors—the so-called Hollywood Ten—were cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to testify. In addition, motion picture executives drew up a “blacklist” of about 500 screenwriters, directors, and writers who were suspended from work for their supposed political beliefs and associations.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>HUAC next turned its attention to the State Department. Prodded by the relentless investigation of Richard Nixon, a freshman congressman from California, the committee discovered that a prominent State Department official named Alger Hiss had been a Soviet spy in the 1930s. Even more disquieting news surfaced when the government discovered that a British-American spy network transmitted atomic secrets to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE RISE OF McCARTHYISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The HUAC revelations touched a sensitive public nerve. The American people believed they were locked in a life-or-death struggle with the Soviet Union. Angry and bewildered citizens wanted to know why America appeared to be losing the Cold War.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Joseph McCarthy, a previously obscure Senator from Wisconsin, skillfully exploited the political climate of paranoia. On February 9, 1950, McCarthy told an audience in Wheeling, West Virginia, that America’s foreign policy failures could be traced to communist influence in the State Department. He menacingly declared, “I have in my hand a list of 205—a list of names known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>McCarthy failed to uncover a single communist. His practice of making unsubstantiated accusations of disloyalty without evidence became known as <em>McCarthyism</em>.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_240"/>E.</strong></span><strong>THE FALL OF McCARTHY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>McCarthy’s campaign of innuendo and half-truths continued into the Eisenhower administration. Many presidential advisors urged Ike to use his own great prestige to confront McCarthy. But Eisenhower refused, saying, “I will not get in the gutter with that guy.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>McCarthy finally caused his own downfall when he launched a televised investigation of the U.S. Army. During the spring of 1954, a national audience of more than 20 million people watched as McCarthy bullied witnesses, twisted testimony, and introduced phony evidence. The Army-McCarthy hearings turned public sentiment against McCarthy, revealing him to be an unscrupulous demagogue.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In December 1954, the full Senate formally censured McCarthy for his dishonorable conduct. Flashing his famous grin, Ike asked his cabinet, “Have you heard the latest? McCarthyism is McCarthywasm.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE FIRST RED SCARE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The First Red Scare lasted from 1919 to 1920. Millions of victorious soldiers returned from Europe only to find unemployment, labor unrest, and widespread racial tensions. Meanwhile, the Bolshevik Revolution and the ensuing creation of a communist dictatorship in the Soviet Union seemed to pose a threat to American society. This fear of revolutionary unrest at home and abroad led to the First Red Scare.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer led the fight against radical subversion. Palmer mobilized an army of government agents who raided the homes, offices, and meeting places of radical labor unions, alleged socialists, recent immigrants, and aliens. The Palmer Raids constituted a serious violation of civil liberties as the government deported about 500 aliens without hearings or trials.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The paranoia inspired by the First Red Scare broke after the ill-conceived Palmer Raids aroused widespread protests from defenders of American civil liberties. America then turned to enjoy a New Era of carefree prosperity symbolized by jazz, flappers, and the Model T.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_241"/>B.</strong></span><strong>THE SECOND RED SCARE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The fear of radicalism reasserted itself in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Second Red Scare was a response to rising Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union. The threat of nuclear war and the evidence that communist spies had infiltrated the Manhattan Project and the State Department triggered a wave of anticommunist fear and suspicion.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and Senator Joseph McCarthy led the fight to uncover spies infiltrating government agencies. HUAC investigated the Hollywood film industry and the State Department. Their investigation of Hollywood led to unfounded accusations and ruined careers. However, their investigation of the State Department led to surprising revelations of suspicious conduct by Alger Hiss. Intoxicated by his power, McCarthy ignored civil liberties while failing to discover a single communist agent.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The paranoia inspired by the Second Red Scare broke after the Army-McCarthy hearings fully revealed McCarthy’s vicious campaign of smear and innuendo. Americans then turned to enjoy a period of unprecedented prosperity symbolized by suburban neighborhoods, shopping centers, and sleek new cars.</p>
