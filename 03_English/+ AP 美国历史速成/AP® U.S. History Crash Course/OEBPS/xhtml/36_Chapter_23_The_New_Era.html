<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In November 1917, Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin seized power in Russia and promptly created a communist dictatorship. The revolutionary upheaval in Russia alarmed many Americans who believed that communist sympathizers and other radicals were secretly planning to undermine the U.S. government.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A sudden postwar recession unsettled Americans as prices rose more than 15 percent, 100,000 businesses declared bankruptcy, and 5 million workers lost their jobs.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>STRIKES AND BOMBS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The recession triggered an unprecedented wave of 3,600 strikes as over 4 million workers walked off their jobs.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Public apprehension increased after unions in Seattle co-operated in a general strike, a phenomenon new to America. The public became further unnerved when Boston police staged a walkout leaving the city temporarily unprotected.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The press demonized the strikes as “crimes against society,” “conspiracies against the government,” and most ominously “plots to establish communism.” Alarmed citizens cheered when Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge called the National Guard into Boston to restore order. Coolidge won national acclaim by declaring, “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The wave of strikes coincided with a sudden outbreak of anarchist violence. In April 1919, alert postal workers discovered and defused over thirty mail bombs addressed to leading businessmen and politicians. Just two months later, eight bombs exploded in eight cities, suggesting a nationwide conspiracy. One of the bombs damaged the façade of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer’s home in Washington.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_196"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE PALMER RAIDS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Red Scare, or nationwide fear of radicals, forced Palmer to act. Although no more than one-tenth of one percent of adult Americans belonged to the domestic communist movement, Palmer launched a massive roundup of aliens and alleged communists.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On January 2, 1920, agents of the Department of Justice arrested some 5,000 suspects in a dozen cities across America. The Palmer Raids violated civil liberties as government agents broke into private homes, clubs, coffee shops, and union offices without arrest warrants. Although the Department of Justice released most of those arrested, they nonetheless deported about 500 aliens without hearings or trials.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>BACK TO “NORMALCY”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Palmer Raids marked the end of the Red Scare. The excess of the raids aroused opposition from defenders of American civil liberties. For example, lawyers from the newly formed American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and prominent members of the Supreme Court voiced strong support for upholding the American tradition of tolerance and freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The 1920 presidential campaign offered very different views of America’s future direction. The Democratic candidates, Ohio Governor James M. Cox and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, promised to promote Progressive ideals. In contrast, the Republican candidates, Ohio Senator Warren Harding and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, promised a return to what Harding called “normalcy.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Republican ticket won a landslide victory winning every state outside of the South. Americans now eagerly began a New Era that promised peace and prosperity.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT ON MASS PRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When automobiles first appeared in the late 1890s, they seemed to be a luxury toy for the rich. However, a gifted self-taught engineer named Henry Ford audaciously vowed, “to democratize the automobile. When I’m through,” Ford predicted, “everybody will be able to afford one.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Ford fulfilled his prediction by applying the principles of assembly line production to the manufacture of automobiles. In the first automobile factories, cars remained in one place while a team of skilled mechanics built the vehicle from the ground up. In contrast, on Ford’s new assembly line, overhead conveyer belts and huge turning tables carried moving parts past stationary workers.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The moving assembly line enabled Ford to reduce the time it took to build a car from 12.5 hours to just 1.5 hours. As mass production techniques improved, the price of a Model T Ford fell from $850 in 1908 to $290 in 1924.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The moving assembly line’s precision and efficiency created a new economy based upon mass production. Affordable refrigerators, washing machines, and electric irons rolled off assembly lines across America. The new method of production was not without disadvantages for American workers. Assembly lines created monotonous jobs that eliminated craftsmanship and turned workers into human robots.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT ON DAILY LIFE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the late 1920s, a team of sociologists asked a lifelong resident of Muncie, Indiana, to describe the changes taking place around him. The perceptive but slightly incredulous resident replied, “Why on earth do you need to study what’s changing this country? I can tell you what’s happening in just four letters: A-U-T-O!”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The small-town resident was right. The automobile was indeed a symbol of a new industry transforming American life. Surging car sales stimulated the growth of companies that produced steel, rubber tires, glass, and gasoline. Spurred by the Federal Highway Act of 1916, a growing network of paved roads crisscrossed the country.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Automobiles did more than just stimulate the economy; they also changed countless aspects of daily life. During the 1920s the automobile transformed America from a land of isolated small <span id="page_198"/>towns into a nation of interconnected cities and suburbs. Gas stations, road signs, automatic three-color traffic lights, roadside diners, and traffic jams all became ubiquitous parts of the fabric of American life.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: TECHNOLOGY AND WORKERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1920s humans interacted with machines on assembly lines based on the principles of “scientific management” developed by Frederick W. Taylor. Taylorism used time-and-motion studies to reduce wasted motion and eliminate unnecessary workers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1980s, automobile companies began to use robots to automate their assembly lines. Manufacturers found that the robots were efficient, cost-effective, and safe. However, worried skeptics argue that an accelerating “automation bomb” has the potential to eliminate millions of jobs. Sophisticated robots programmed by highly trained technicians are rapidly becoming the norm in factories across America.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>RADIO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On November 2, 1920, radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh announced the news that the Republican candidate Warren Harding had won a landslide victory over his Democratic rival James Cox. The broadcast signaled the birth of a new industry. By the end of the decade at least one-third of all American households owned a radio.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As the radio mania swept across the country, listeners could enjoy news bulletins, weather reports, sports games, and comedy shows. Families across America listened to the same programs, laughed at the same jokes, and of course heard the same advertisements. By 1929, a growing advertising industry paid radio stations $1 billion to air commercials urging consumers to “buy now and pay later” for an enticing array of products ranging from toothpaste to the latest electric vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MOVIE STARS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In late 1903 American audiences shrieked with shock and delight as the leader of an outlaw band of bandits appeared to point a gun directly at them in a film titled <em>The Great Train Robbery</em>. The <span id="page_199"/>popularity of this twelve-minute movie helped launch a new American industry.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1920s, moviegoers bought over 80 million tickets a week as Hollywood became the center of America’s fifth-largest industry. Feature-length silent films turned Greta Garbo, Charlie Chaplin, and Rudolph Valentino into celebrities earning six-figure salaries.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1927, enthralled fans watched and listened to the first “talkie,” <em>The Jazz Singer</em>. Silent films quickly vanished and a new galaxy of stars, including a cartoon mouse named Mickey, reigned over Hollywood.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>FLAPPERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1920s a rebellious generation of young adults challenged traditional values. Their new independent spirit expressed itself in the changes postwar women were making in their lives. Although most women still followed traditional paths of marriage and family, a growing number of young, well-educated women began choosing a different lifestyle. Influenced by feminists, women wanted greater freedom in their lives. A vanguard of college-educated women sought new careers in medicine, law, and science.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Young women called flappers provided the most visible and shocking model of the new American woman. Flappers challenged conventional norms of feminine appearance by wearing short skirts, heavy makeup, and close-cut bobbed hair. They further jolted the traditional guardians of morality by smoking cigarettes, sipping bootleg liquor, and dancing the Charleston.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>LOST GENERATION WRITERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A group of novelists found much to criticize in America’s new mass culture. Known as the Lost Generation, these writers expressed disillusionment with American culture and often moved to Paris.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis were the best-known Lost Generation novelists. Fitzgerald captured the unfulfilled promise of the Roaring Twenties in <em>This Side of Paradise</em> and in his masterpiece <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. Lewis took satiric aim at middle class conformity and materialism in <em>Main Street</em> and <em>Babbitt</em>.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW NEGRO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1920s, Harlem emerged as a vibrant center of African American culture. A new generation of black writers and artists created an outpouring of literary and artistic works known as the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, James Weldon Johnson, and Zora Neale Hurston formed a core group of Harlem Renaissance writers. Taken together their works expressed a new spirit of black hope and pride. In an influential anthology of Harlem Renaissance writings, Alain LeRoy Locke argued that Harlem functioned as a creative incubator for a “New Negro” who was seizing the opportunity for an assertion of both individual and collective identity.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MARCUS GARVEY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In May 1917, a 30-year-old black Jamaican named Marcus Garvey arrived in Harlem. He soon discovered that African Americans could not escape racism simply by moving to northern cities. Garvey promptly organized a chapter of an organization he called the United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Though hardly noticed at the time, Garvey’s new organization marked a milestone in the growth of black nationalism.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Influenced by Woodrow Wilson’s concept of self-determination, Garvey preached a message of racial pride and self-help. He exhorted his followers to glorify their African heritage and rejoice in the beauty of their black skin. “We have a beautiful history,” Garvey told his listeners, “and we shall create another one in the future.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Garvey’s vision captured the imagination of black people in America, the Caribbean, and Africa. By the mid-1920s, the UNIA had 700 branches in 38 states and the West Indies. Garvey had become one of the most famous black spokespersons in the world.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Garvey’s fame proved to be short-lived. In the mid-1920s he was charged with mail fraud, sentenced to jail, and ultimately deported to his native Jamaica. Garvey nonetheless left behind an important legacy. His emphasis upon racial pride and economic self-sufficiency influenced Malcolm X’s concept of black nationalism. Dr. King praised Garvey as “the first man on a mass scale and level to give millions of Negroes a sense of dignity and destiny.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: WHAT CAUSED INTOLERANCE AND NATIVISM IN THE 1920s?</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Flappers, satiric writers, immigrants, and radicals were all aspects of the new urban culture taking root during the 1920s. Historian Robert Divine argues that rural Americans resented these assaults on their traditional values. According to Divine, “Rural Americans saw in the city all that was evil in contemporary life . . . Accordingly, the countryside struck back at the new dominant urban areas, aiming to restore the primacy of the Anglo-Saxon and predominantly Protestant culture they revered.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A second group of historians led by Burl L. Noggle do not view the intolerance and nativism during the 1920s as a strictly rural counterattack. Noggle argues that the twin forces of industrialization and urbanization “left many Americans in such a state of disequilibrium that they could not relieve their anxieties and regain their sense of security without taking some sort of action.” The Red Scare represented the first postwar manifestation of this national insecurity. Seen from this perspective, Noggle believes that the Red Scare “never really ended.” Intolerance and nativism were both deeply rooted and thus enduring characteristics of American society during the 1920s.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE SACCO AND VANZETTI CASE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The most celebrated criminal trial of the 1920s involved two Italian-born anarchists, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. The two men were arrested for a payroll robbery and murder.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A lack of conclusive evidence convinced many that Sacco and Vanzetti were victims of prejudice against radicals and recent immigrants. Nonetheless, following seven years of litigation both men were executed in the electric chair.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SCOPES TRIAL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In January 1925, the state of Tennessee passed the Butler Act forbidding the teaching of evolution in the public schools. The act expressed the alarm felt by many fundamentalist Christians who opposed Darwin’s theory of evolution because it challenged their literal interpretation of the Bible.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>John T. Scopes, a Tennessee high school science teacher, accepted the American Civil Liberties Union offer to test the constitutionality <span id="page_202"/>of the Butler Act. Clarence Darrow, a well-known champion of civil liberties, agreed to defend Scopes. William Jennings Bryan, a three-time Democratic presidential candidate and well-known religious fundamentalist, represented the state. For a national and international audience the case provided a dramatic illustration of the cultural conflict between fundamentalism represented by Bryan and modernism represented by Darrow.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In the end, the court found Scopes guilty and fined him $100.00. The Tennessee Supreme Court overruled the fine on a technicality while upholding the Butler Act.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Sacco and Vanzetti case highlighted the public’s fear of recent immigrants. A new postwar wave of arrivals from Southern and Eastern Europe sparked a nationwide movement to limit immigrants from these regions.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Congress responded to the nativist push for restrictive measures by passing the National Origins Act of 1924. The law limited annual immigration to 2 percent of a country’s population in the United States as of the 1890 census, sharply cutting the flow of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE RISE AND FALL OF THE KU KLUX KLAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The original Ku Klux Klan terrorized newly freed blacks in the post–Civil War South before dying out in the 1870s. The post–World War I mood of distrust and intolerance fueled a revival of the KKK. The new Klan directed its hostility toward immigrants, Catholics, Jews, and African Americans. It favored immigration restriction and white supremacy.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>By the mid-1920s, membership in the Klan swelled to as many as 4 million people. However, passage of the National Origins Act removed the Klan’s most popular issue. Divided by recurring leadership quarrels, the Klan once again became a marginal group on the periphery of American society.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The American public welcomed the end of Wilson’s idealistic crusades and enthusiastically endorsed Harding’s promise of a “return to normalcy.” Harding’s economic policies reconfirmed <span id="page_203"/>the traditional partnership between business and government. His Secretary of Treasury Andrew Mellon reduced tax rates for the wealthy, raised tariffs, and ignored antitrust regulations.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although Harding was personally honest, his relaxed leadership enabled venal appointees to profit from their corrupt activities.

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Harding administration scandals left Vice President Coolidge untouched. A man of few words, Coolidge deserved his popular nickname “Silent Cal.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>America enjoyed a period of unprecedented prosperity as Coolidge won election to a full term in 1924. The popular president could have easily won reelection in 1928. However, the taciturn Coolidge unexpectedly announced, “I do not choose to run.”</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Republicans turned to Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover to be their party’s standard bearer in the 1928 presidential election. The public respected Hoover as a generous humanitarian and a skilled administrator.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Hoover’s landslide victory over Al Smith of New York seemed to confirm the public’s support for Republican policies.
