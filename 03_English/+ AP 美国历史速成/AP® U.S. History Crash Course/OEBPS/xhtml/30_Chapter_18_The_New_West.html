<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span> Most people moving westward before the Civil War traveled directly from the Midwest to the Far West. Based upon reports from early trailblazers, Americans believed that a sparsely inhabited desert filled the vast prairies between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The West was neither a desert nor uninhabited. The region was in fact a diverse land inhabited by Indians, Hispanics, Asians, and a growing number of American settlers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE WESTERN TRIBES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Great Plains were home to about 250,000 of the Indians who remained in the United States.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>First brought to North America by the Spanish, horses thrived on the western grasslands. Once tamed, the small but powerful horses quickly transformed the Plains Indians into superb hunters who followed vast herds containing millions of buffalos. The Indians ate the creature’s meat, fashioned its hides into clothes, and even turned its sinews and tendons into string for their bows.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1851, representatives of the United States government and a number of Plains tribes signed the Fort Laramie Treaty. The tribes guaranteed safe passage for settlers on the Oregon Trail and allowed the construction of roads and forts. In exchange they received defined lands that would be theirs forever. But “forever” lasted less than four decades.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE HISPANIC WEST</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Much of the land from Texas to California began as part of the Spanish Empire and then became part of the Mexican Republic. Following the Mexican-American War thousands of Hispanic people living in this region became residents of American territory.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_144"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Hispanic elite lost much of their political authority and economic prosperity as American settlers moved into the region. By the late nineteenth century, Hispanics became part of a large working class.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE CHINESE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The gold rush and demand for railroad construction workers sparked a mass migration of Chinese workers to California. By the 1870s, Chinese immigrants comprised the largest non-European group in California.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>At first, Californians welcomed the Chinese, praising their work ethic. But as the Chinese communities became larger and more conspicuous, many Californians began to view them as economic rivals who worked for low wages.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>As anti-Chinese agitation spread up and down the Pacific coast, calls for immigration restriction grew louder. Congress responded to this nativist pressure by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The law suspended immigration of all Chinese laborers for ten years. Congress renewed the legislation in 1892 and then made it permanent in 1902. The Chinese Exclusion Act marked the first law enacted to exclude a specific ethnic or racial group from immigrating to the United States.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>MIGRATION FROM THE EAST</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>By 1860, California, Oregon, and Texas were established states with large and growing Anglo-American populations. Traders, farmers, and ranchers from Texas had already begun to establish outposts in New Mexico and Arizona.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The three decades between 1870 and 1900 witnessed an unprecedented migration of miners, ranchers, and farmers into the West.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>“THE LAST RAIL IS LAID”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1862, President Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act authorizing the construction of a transcontinental railroad. The Central Pacific started at Sacramento, California, and with a labor force made up largely of Chinese workers, pushed east over the rugged Sierra Nevada Mountains. At the same time, the Union <span id="page_145"/>Pacific started in Omaha, Nebraska, and with a labor force made up largely of Irish workers, pushed west across the gently sloping Great Plains.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The two lines linked on May 10, 1869, at Promontory Summit, Utah, when an official used a silver hammer to drive in a ceremonial golden spike. At 3:05 <small>PM</small>, officials in New York received a telegram triumphantly announcing, “The last rail is laid; the last spike is driven; the Pacific Railroad is completed.” The news sparked nationwide celebrations as jubilant citizens rang church bells, unfurled flags, and fired cannons.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The completion of the first transcontinental railroad marked the beginning of a building boom across the West. By 1893, five transcontinental lines linked the east and west coasts with what one railroad financier called “a strong band of iron.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSCONTINENTALS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Before the transcontinentals, it took almost six months to travel from New York to California. The new railroads cut travel time between the two coasts to just one week. The world as Americans experienced it had now grown smaller and faster.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The transcontinental railroads became a visible symbol of national union. After 1869, goods and people could freely move across the entire country without passing through customs or a passport control. This created a vast integrated national market for raw materials and manufactured goods. Within ten years of its completion, the Pacific Railroad annually shipped $50 million worth of freight coast to coast.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Before the transcontinental railroads, every town in America had its own “local” time. The national rail lines required a uniform schedule so that passengers and freight could arrive and depart on time. The need for coordination led to the creation of four standardized time zones that still regulate daily life today.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The rails carried more than just raw materials and manufactured goods. As the lines grew bigger and safer, companies encouraged eastern settlers by offering to carry whole families to their new homes in the West for free. The railroads did not limit their appeals to Americans. They set up offices in Europe and distributed pamphlets containing glowing descriptions of the wonders waiting for immigrants willing to seek new lives in the great American West. For example, one pamphlet stretched the truth by describing the normally dry Platte Valley as “a flowing meadow of great <span id="page_146"/>fertility clothed in nutritious grasses and watered by numerous streams.” Attracted by promises of fertile land, large numbers of Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, and Germans immigrated to the United States.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The transcontinental railroads did not benefit everyone. The buffalo had been the center of the Plains Indian way of life for centuries. The railroads enabled hunters to nearly exterminate the vast herds that roamed the Great Plains. This wanton slaughter dealt a catastrophic blow to the culture of the Plains Indians.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The transcontinental railroads created America’s first nationwide transportation system. Their success doomed the pony express, wagon trains, stagecoach lines, and even the fast clipper ships that sailed around the tip of South America and up the California coast.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Less than a century after the completion of the first transcontinental, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 authorized the construction of a 40,000-mile network of four-lane interstate highways. The new interstates promoted automobile traffic and gave a huge boost to the trucking industry. The loss of passengers and freight dealt a serious setback to the nation’s railroad industry.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE MINERS’ FRONTIER</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The California Gold Rush demonstrated that the discovery of precious metals would spark a frenetic rush of prospectors into a region. This pattern repeated itself across the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains. For example, the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada, yielded deposits of gold and silver worth more than $300 million, the richest single strike in American history. At its peak in the 1870s, Virginia City had 30,000 people and 100 saloons. Deserted in the 1880s, the town survives today as a tourist attraction.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_147"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Mining towns attracted a diverse and combustible mix of white, black, American Indian, Mexican, and Chinese miners. Wild and unregulated mining towns often verged on anarchy. “There are duels, shooting affrays, and hangings by mob law most every week,” wrote one astonished traveler from Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Most miners hoped to get rich and then get out. The heyday of gold and silver rushes exploited by individual miners ended by the 1890s. Although virtually all the placer or surface gold and silver has been discovered, the West continues to be a mineral-rich region. Today, large corporations dominate mining operations. Led by Nevada, the United States currently produces almost 7 percent of the world’s gold production.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE COWBOYS’ FRONTIER</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The vast stretches of grassland in southwest Texas supported herds containing about five million head of longhorn cattle. By the mid-1860s, fast-growing cities in the East created a growing demand for meat. Getting Texas cattle to these markets posed a challenging problem. The famous long drives from Texas to railheads in Kansas provided a lucrative solution.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the twenty years after the Civil War, cowboys drove herds of 2,000 to 2,500 steers on long drives to “cow towns” in Kansas. For example, the Chisholm Trail provided a well-traveled route from San Antonio to the railhead in Abilene, Kansas.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>During the peak years of the 1870s, as many as 40,000 cowboys roamed the Great Plains. Mexicans and African Americans comprised about one-third of this total.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The era of the long drives ended by the late 1880s. Open-range cattle ranching became less profitable as beef prices fell. In addition, many ranchers lost half or more of their herds because of unusually cold winters that struck the Great Plains in 1886 and 1887.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE FARMERS’ FRONTIER</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Homestead Act of 1862 and the completion of the transcontinental railroads opened the West to farming. In the 30 years between 1870 and 1900, more land was made into farms than in all the previous 250 years.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Great Plains agriculture posed new challenges for farmers. Blizzards, fires, and swarms of locusts swept across the arid and treeless prairies. Farmers accustomed to log cabins had to <span id="page_148"/>learn how to build sod houses. A series of new tools including mechanical reapers, wind-driven water pumps, and barbed-wire fences enabled determined farmers to overcome natural obstacles and build successful homesteads.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The population of the Great Plains steadily increased. For example, during the 1870s over 600,000 people settled in Kansas. This population included about 25,000 black pioneers called exodusters. By 1890, over 500,000 African Americans lived west of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE INDIANS’ LAST STAND</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The construction of the transcontinental railroads, the slaughter of the buffalo, the spread of epidemic diseases, and the destructive effects of constant warfare all threatened to end the autonomy of the Plains Indians.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The U.S. government no longer honored its Fort Laramie promises. Instead of trying to concentrate the Plains Indians on large blocks of land, the government moved the Indians onto small reservations in out-of-the-way areas. One Indian leader bitterly complained, “Since the Great Father promised that we should never be removed, we have been moved five times . . . I think you had better put the Indians on wheels, and you can run them about wherever you wish.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1875, thousands of gold prospectors rushed onto Sioux lands in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory. The unwanted invasion combined with a harsh winter forced starving Sioux and Cheyenne to leave their reservations. When the Indians refused orders to return, the army ordered General George A. Custer to force them to obey. On June 25, 1876, warriors led by Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull annihilated Custer’s Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Indian victory hastened their ultimate defeat. News of the disaster reached the East on July 4, 1876, as Americans celebrated the nation’s centennial. An outraged public now demanded that the full force of the U.S. Army be used to subdue the Plains Indians. America’s overwhelming military power prevailed. One proud but forlorn chief sadly observed, “We have reached the end of our rule, and a new one has come . . . Of our once powerful nation there are now but a few left.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_149"/>B.</strong></span><strong><em>A CENTURY OF DISHONOR</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Although the government could defeat the Plains Indians, it could not suppress the truth about how it had mistreated them. In 1881, Helen Hunt Jackson published <em>A Century of Dishonor</em> documenting the misdeeds of corrupt Indian agents, duplicitous government officials, and land-hungry settlers. Jackson castigated the government for its role in “a tale of wrongs and oppressions . . . that is too monstrous to be believed.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Like many other well-meaning reformers, Jackson supported policies designed to bring Native Americans into the mainstream of American life. <em>A Century of Dishonor</em> played a key role in mobilizing public support for the Dawes Act.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE DAWES ACT, 1887</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Well-meaning but ethnocentric reformers believed that the Indians’ traditional tribal culture was an obstacle preventing them from assimilating into mainstream white society. The Dawes Act tried to “civilize” Native Americans by turning them into independent self-supporting farmers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Dawes Act dissolved the tribes as legal entities and divided their tribal lands into individual homesteads of 160 acres. Reservation lands not allocated to the Indians were sold to the railroads and to white settlers.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Dawes Act ignored the importance traditional Indian culture placed on tribally held land. Instead of transforming Native Americans into self-supporting farmers, the Dawes Act undermined their culture and cost them their land.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: OFFICIAL INDIAN POLICY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>By 1900, Native Americans lost 50 percent of the 156 million acres they held before the Dawes Act became law.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1934, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act as the centerpiece of the “Indian New Deal.” The act reversed the assimilationist policies set in motion by the Dawes Act by recognizing, strengthening, and preserving the tribes’ historic traditions and culture. The law also restored the Indians’ right to manage their land and mineral rights.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>TURNER’S FRONTIER THESIS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1890, the Superintendent of the U.S. Census issued a statement declaring that the western frontier had closed. The finding surprised and intrigued Frederick Jackson Turner, a young history professor at the University of Wisconsin. He concluded that the closing of the frontier symbolized the end of a great historic movement.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In a seminal paper entitled “The Significance of the Frontier in American History,” Turner contended that the frontier experience profoundly shaped the American character. According to Turner, the frontier promoted democracy and encouraged individualism. It produced a unique combination of traits including resilience, self-reliance, and an optimistic faith in democratic institutions. The western frontier also promoted opportunity by providing an open society where rigid class lines did not block social mobility.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Turner’s thesis justified and reinforced the view of Manifest Destiny as a positive force that extended American democratic ideals across the continent.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>LIMERICK’S CRITIQUE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Patricia Nelson Limerick is an American historian who is one of the nation’s foremost scholars of the American West.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Published in 1986, her influential book <em>The Legacy of Conquest</em> offered a critique of Turner’s thesis and a new view of the West.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Turner viewed the West as an open, untamed space with few inhabitants. In contrast, Limerick described the West as inhabited by a diverse group of people and cultures including Native Americans, Hispanics, Asians, African Americans, and White Americans. These groups collided in a process marked by conquest and uneasy bargains.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Limerick views the forcible conquest and annexation of the West as an example of American expansionism that opposed and even undermined the nation’s democratic spirit.</p>
