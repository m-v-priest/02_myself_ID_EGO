<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW URBAN REALITY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Between 1870 and 1900, urban centers assumed a dominant role in American life and culture. Just after the Civil War only one in six Americans lived in communities with a population of 8,000 or more. By 1900, one in three Americans made their homes in cities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>A large number of the new urban dwellers came from small towns and rural areas. New mechanical farm equipment pushed many workers off the land. Still others wanted to exchange the drudgery of farm life for the excitement of living in cities. Electricity, indoor plumbing, telephones, and department stores all combined to make cities an irresistible magnet that promised an exciting new life.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>INDUSTRY AND URBAN GROWTH</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Before the Civil War, factories were dependent upon water for their power. As a result, they were usually built near swift rivers and waterfalls. However, in the late nineteenth century, factories increasingly used steam and then electrical power. Factory owners could now build their plants near growing centers of population.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the post–Civil War period transportation centers became booming industrial cities. Meat-packing plants in Chicago, flour mills in Minneapolis, and oil refineries in Cleveland all offered jobs for unskilled workers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>SKYSCRAPERS AND VERTICAL GROWTH</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Before the 1860s, few buildings reached heights greater than three or four stories. Soaring urban populations and rising urban property values placed pressure on engineers and architects to find ways to design taller buildings.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Steel-frames and electric elevators enabled architects to design buildings so tall they were called skyscrapers. The nine-story <span id="page_162"/>Wainwright Building in St. Louis paved the way for a new generation of multi-story factories, apartment buildings, and department stores. Soon bigger and better skyscrapers were rising over American cities topped in 1892 by Chicago’s soaring 22-story Masonic Temple, then the tallest building in the world.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>ELECTRIC TROLLEYS AND HORIZONTAL EXPANSION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Before the 1890s, horses and mule-drawn streetcars provided the chief sources of urban transportation. In 1888, Richmond, Virginia, successfully tested the first electric trolley system. Within two years, 200 other cities opened trolley lines. By 1900, 30,000 cars carried passengers on 15,000 miles of track.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The new electric streetcars promoted the horizontal expansion of cities. The growing middle-class could now live in tree-lined “streetcar suburbs” and commute into the central city for business or entertainment. This first ring of suburbs began the process of segregating urban residents by class, race, and ethnicity.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>A NEW WAVE OF IMMIGRATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Before the 1880s, most immigrants to the United States came from countries in Western Europe and Scandinavia. However, the last two decades of the nineteenth century witnessed a massive wave of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The overwhelming majority of these “new” immigrants came from Italy, Poland, Russia, and Greece.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Europe’s new industrial economy replaced the older agricultural way of life, uprooting millions of people. Most of the immigrants from Italy were pushed out by unemployment, crushing poverty, and epidemics of cholera and malaria. Immigrants from Poland and Russia fled government-condoned pogroms, acts of violence in which vandals burned and pillaged Jewish homes and shops. Almost all of these uprooted people viewed America as a land of freedom and opportunity.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>A HARD NEW LIFE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The overwhelming majority of the new immigrants settled in large cities in the Northeast and Midwest. Two-thirds of all the new immigrants found homes in New York, New England, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Very few went to the South.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_163"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The new immigrants quickly faced a grim reality that tested their optimistic faith in America as the “land of opportunity.” Many immigrants lived in crowded tenements and worked 12-hour days in grimy factories, dangerous coal mines, and crowded sweatshops where they stitched clothing and rolled cigars. One Italian saying expressed the sense of disillusionment felt by many immigrants: “I came to America because I heard the streets were paved with gold. When I got here, I found out three things: First, the streets weren’t paved with gold; second, they weren’t paved at all; and third, I was expected to pave them.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Bewildered immigrants often congregated into urban enclaves. The “Little Italys,” “Little Hungarys” and other ethnic neighborhoods provided close-knit communities where the new immigrants could speak their native language and practice their religious faith.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>IMMIGRANTS AND POLITICAL MACHINES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Most immigrants were politically inexperienced. America’s federal system with its local, state, and national governments seemed complex and overwhelming. As a result, many immigrants became clients of big city political machines.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The boss and his ward leaders provided poor immigrants with services such as free food, clothing, and coal in exchange for their votes. “If a family is burned out,” explained one candid machine boss, “I don’t ask whether they are Republicans or Democrats. I just get quarters for them, bring clothes for them if their clothes were burned up and fix them up till they get things runnin’ again. Who can tell how many votes these fires bring me? . . . The poor are the most grateful people in the world.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The political machines provided the new immigrants with a rudimentary form of welfare. At the same time, venal bosses often engaged in illegal schemes that cost their cities millions of dollars. New York City, for example, fell under the control of a group of corrupt politicians known as the “Tweed Ring.” Boss Tweed and his cronies stole as much as $200 million from the public treasury.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Tweed’s reign of unbridled greed and theft finally came to an end from an unexpected source. Thomas Nast exposed Tweed’s fraudulent practices in a series of political cartoons that mercilessly portrayed the boss as the leader of a group of thieves and scoundrels. In one particularly devastating cartoon, Nast gave the rotund Tweed a moneybag for a head!</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_164"/>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: NATIVIST REACTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The wave of Irish and German immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s sparked a nativist reaction against Catholics. The Know-Nothing Party raised the issue of restricting immigration and excluding Catholics from holding political office. Although the party enjoyed brief support, it quickly disappeared as Americans shifted their focus to the impending crisis over slavery and disunion.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The wave of new immigrants also provoked an intense nativist response. The new immigrants spoke different languages, practiced different religions, and worked for low wages. Alarmed nativists formed the American Protective Association (APA) to demand more restrictive immigration laws. Although the APA claimed 2.5 million members, it never formed a political party.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Even though the APA faded from the scene, opposition to immigration did not vanish. Led by the newly formed Immigration Restriction League, nativists supported a literacy test as a way to stem the tide of unwanted immigrants. When Congress passed a literacy test in 1896, President Cleveland vetoed the bill, insisting that America should remain an asylum for the oppressed of Europe.</p>

<p class="C568"><strong><em>APUSH exams often include a graph to generate questions about immigration trends between 1820 and 1900. It is important to remember that the industrial revolution played a key role in contributing to the rising rate of immigration to the United States. The flood of people into the Midwest and Northeast provoked a strong nativist reaction that ultimately led to restrictions on immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe in the 1920s</em>.</strong></p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>JACOB RIIS AND <em>HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Immigrant families packed into rows of squalid tenement buildings. A single square mile in New York City’s Lower East Side contained 334,000 people, making it the most densely populated place in the world.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Jacob Riis was a journalist and photographer who exposed the poverty and despair of the Lower East Side. Published in 1890, his book <em>How the Other Half Lives</em> included deeply troubling pictures of destitute families crammed into overcrowded tenements where <span id="page_165"/>60 or more people might share one stopped-up toilet and a single water tap.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Riis was not content to simply document the wretched conditions in New York’s disease-ridden tenements. He hoped that his photographs would shock a complacent public into calling for reforms. Riis’s concern was not in vain. <em>How the Other Half Lives</em> prompted a public outcry that led to improvements in sewers, garbage collection, and indoor plumbing. New York City tore down some of the worse slums replacing them with new parks and playgrounds.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>JANE ADDAMS AND THE SETTLEMENT HOUSE MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jane Addams, like Jacob Riis, chose to devote her life to bettering the condition of the urban poor. In 1889, Addams rented Hull House, an old mansion in one of Chicago’s poorest immigrant neighborhoods. Addams began by providing day nurseries for working mothers and offering adult-education classes for immigrants who wanted to learn English. As Hull House became more successful, Addams offered practical courses on cooking, dressmaking, and personal hygiene. At its peak, Hull House expanded to a dozen buildings and served 2,000 people a week.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Hull House served as a model for other middle-class women who founded over 400 settlement houses in cities across America. The settlement houses often extended their mission to include lobbying local governments to enact reform legislation. Settlement houses thus gave a new generation of women organizational and leadership skills that transcended their traditional roles as mothers and wives.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>WALTER RAUSCHENBUSCH AND THE SOCIAL GOSPEL MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Walter Rauschenbusch, a Baptist theologian, was deeply stirred by the plight of his parishioners in the Hell’s Kitchen section of New York City. Convinced that something had to be done, he advocated applying the Christian principles of love and justice to the nation’s pressing urban problems. He inspired his followers by preaching that the Kingdom of God “is not a matter of getting individuals to heaven, but of transforming the life on earth into the harmony of heaven.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Rauschenbusch’s religious philosophy became known as the Social Gospel. Supporters of the Social Gospel movement believed that America’s churches had a moral responsibility to take the lead in actively confronting social problems and in helping the poor.</p>
<div class="C565"><p class="C564"><img alt="" src="../img/30_1.jpg"/></p></div>
<p class="C568"><strong><em><span id="page_166"/>Carnegie’s</em> Gospel of Wealth <em>and Rauschenbusch’s Social Gospel are easily confused. Remember, Carnegie believed that the rich have a duty to serve their communities, while Rauschenbusch believed that Christian ministers and their congregations must play an active role in helping the unfortunate</em>.</strong></p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Prior to the Industrial Revolution, organized leisure was a luxury reserved for the upper class. The Industrial Revolution created a new middle class of corporate managers and urban professionals who earned disposable income beyond their basic needs of food, clothing, and rent. They also had leisure time on weekends and even the possibility of a week-long vacation.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In a popular ballad in the 1890s, a country mother warns her daughter to be wary of the temptations “in the city’s giddy whirl” of amusements. The young city-bound daughter probably shrugged off her mother’s well-meaning admonition. During the Gilded Age, America’s fast-changing cities offered residents and visitors an alluring popular culture that included glamorous department stores, professional sports, and mass-circulation newspapers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>DEPARTMENT STORES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the late 1870s and early 1880s, R. H. Macy in New York City, John Wanamaker in Philadelphia, and Marshall Field in Chicago opened huge stores offering a wide range of consumer goods in different categories called “departments.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The new department stores revolutionized the urban shopping experience. Well-dressed clerks provided “service with a smile” as shoppers examined displays of stylish wardrobes and counters filled with ready-made products from America’s booming industries. When customers tired of shopping, they could ride plush elevators to rooftop restaurants and tearooms.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>SPECTATOR SPORTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Baseball began its reign as America’s pastime during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Formed in 1869, the Cincinnati <span id="page_167"/>Red Stockings became America’s first salaried team. Within a few years eight teams formed the National League. By 1889, two million fans cheered for their local teams at major league games.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Football quickly emerged as America’s second most popular spectator game. Unlike baseball, football originated on college and university campuses. Princeton and Rutgers played the first intercollegiate game in 1869. Within a short time football became an integral part of college life.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>NEWSPAPERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Traditional American newspapers featured pages called “tombstones” because they were filled with long columns of gray print devoted to dry topics. Joseph Pulitzer believed these staid journals needed a remodeling to fit the needs and interests of citizens living in America’s bustling cities. Pulitzer transformed the once dull pages of the <em>New York World</em> into a modern newspaper by adding headlines, comic strips, and sensational stories about celebrity scandals, natural disasters, and corrupt politicians. Typewriters, telephones, and high-capacity rotary presses all helped Pulitzer reach a mass urban audience.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Paid advertisements enabled the <em>New York World</em> to only charge a few pennies for each newspaper. Department stores were especially committed to using newspaper ads to promote their latest special sales. By 1900, American businesses spent $500 million on ads, ten times more than they spent just 30 years before.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>A NEW REALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Romanticism dominated American art and literature during most of the nineteenth century. However, the twin forces of industrialization and urbanization created harsh new social realities that conflicted with Romanticism’s emphasis upon nature and intuitive feelings. A talented group of American artists and authors rejected Romanticism turning instead to Realism’s hard-edged portraits of urban life.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Realism’s artists and authors focused on the facets of the modern world they could personally experience. Idealized landscapes and sentimental love stories seemed out of touch with America’s raw and raucous cities.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_168"/>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ASHCAN ARTISTS AND REALISTIC AUTHORS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A new generation of young artists relished portraying New York City’s vibrant and unruly life. They typically painted working class taverns, prize fights, bleak tenements, and dark alleys. Shocked critics insisted that these “raw” scenes were only fit for an ash can. The artists soon adopted the name “Ashcan” as a badge of honor. For a famous example of Ashcan art, see <em>Cliff Dwellers</em> by George Bellows.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Talented authors also rejected Romanticism. Stephen Crane and Theodore Dreiser strove to create a more authentic or realistic portrayal of American urban life. For example, in <em>Maggie: A Girl of the Streets</em>, Crane tells the story of a beautiful young girl enduring harsh conditions in a New York City slum.</p>
