<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Lyndon Johnson crushed Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. LBJ’s overwhelming victory seemed to usher in a new age of liberal dominance and conservative retreat.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Despite surface appearances, an unanticipated series of historic events and demographic forces revived the conservative movement. By the 1980 presidential election, a previously unconnected coalition of Sun Belt conservatives, evangelical Christians, and blue-collar “Reagan Democrats” converged to elect Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE RISE OF THE SUN BELT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>First recognized during the 1950s and ’60s, the population and influence of the Sun Belt continued to grow during the 1970s. Led by California, Florida, and Texas, the Sun Belt’s population surged past the older industrial regions in the North and East.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Sun Belt states included a prosperous suburban population voicing increasingly strong opposition to intrusive government regulations and rising taxes. The Sun Belt conservatives formed what historian Lisa McGirr calls “the ground forces of the conservative revival.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Electoral College reflected the Sun Belt’s rising political power. For example, California’s number of electoral votes rose from 32 in 1960 to 45 in 1980, the most of any state.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE RISE OF THE NEW RIGHT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater argued that the liberal welfare state created by the New Deal should be reversed. Goldwater’s message survived his defeat. While New Left activists criticized the Great Society for not being bold enough, <span id="page_284"/>conservative political activists decried the program for enlarging the welfare state.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Political observers called the growing conservative movement the New Right. By 1980, New Right political operatives honed a message calling for states’ rights, a more limited federal government, and free-market economic policies.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE RISE OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The counterculture’s attack on traditional values, the newly vocal gay rights movement, and the assertiveness of radical feminists all alarmed evangelical Christians. In addition to these concerns, two key Supreme Court decisions mobilized what became known as the Religious Right. In <em>Engel v. Vitale</em> (1962), the Court ruled that local officials violated the separation of church and state by composing a school prayer and encouraging its recitation in the public schools. Eleven years later, in <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> the Court guaranteed women the right to an abortion.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>By the mid-1970s, over a quarter of adult Americans identified themselves as born-again Christians. Led by Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, a new generation of evangelical ministers used popular television programs to voice the growing perception that the erosion of traditional values was causing a serious moral decline. In 1979, Falwell formed the Moral Majority to advance the conservative agenda and defeat liberal politicians.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE RISE OF REAGAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Ronald Reagan was born in 1911 in rural Illinois. He graduated from Eureka College and then worked as a radio announcer and sportscaster before beginning a Hollywood movie career. Although never a major star, Reagan did perform in fifty-three movies between 1937 and 1953. These years in front of a camera helped Reagan develop a comfortable stage presence that would become a political asset during the age of television.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>When Reagan’s movie career ended, he became the genial host of the popular television program <em>The General Electric Theater</em>. As the voice of the General Electric Company, Reagan’s political views shifted to the right.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1964, Reagan delivered a forceful television speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater. The speech established Reagan as a rising leader in the conservative movement. In 1966, he won the first of two terms as governor of California. Reagan’s promise to restore order <span id="page_285"/>at the Berkeley University campus placed him in the forefront of the reaction against the counterculture.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>In the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan offered voters an optimistic vision of America’s future. His self-assurance and solid conservative credentials united a victorious coalition that swept him to an overwhelming victory. The new president confidently called upon America to “begin an era of national renewal.”</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Reagan inherited a combination of rising unemployment and inflation known as stagflation. Less then three weeks after taking office, he told the nation, “We’re in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Reagan opposed the use of a New Deal-type program to revive the economy. Instead, he reversed generations of progressive thought by declaring, “Government is not the solution to our problems. Government is the problem.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>REAGANOMICS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Reagan called upon Congress to sharply reduce government funding of social and welfare programs. He argued that these cuts would help curb federal spending and fight inflation. Reagan also asked Congress to enact a three-year 25 percent cut in personal and corporate tax rates.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Reagan believed these tax cuts would stimulate economic growth. According to supply-side economic theory, falling tax rates would encourage consumers to buy more goods and corporations to hire more workers.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Reporters promptly labeled the president’s supply-side economic program Reaganomics. Reagan skillfully used television speeches to build public support for his program. The president’s success <span id="page_286"/>earned him the nickname the “Great Communicator.” Within a few months, Congress passed Reagan’s budget and tax cuts.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF REAGANOMICS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Reaganomics failed to produce immediate results. Instead of reviving, the economy sank into a steep recession as unemployment climbed to over 10 percent. Despite the difficult beginning, Reagan urged the public “to stay the course.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Reagan’s confidence proved to be justified. America enjoyed a sustained period of economic growth from 1982 to 1988. During this time the economy added more than 17 million jobs and inflation dropped to single digits.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>However, Reaganomics also produced troubling long-term problems. Despite deep cuts in social programs, federal spending continued to escalate as the defense budget soared to new heights to counter the perceived Soviet threat. Because of Reagan’s massive tax cuts, the government took in less money and had to borrow heavily to pay its bills. Under Reagan, the national debt of the United States tripled from about $900 billion to $2.6 trillion. Once the world’s biggest lender, the United States had become its largest debtor.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Reagan became president at a particularly pivotal time in the Cold War. Détente failed to deter Soviet aggression. In late 1979, the Red Army invaded Afghanistan to support a pro-Soviet puppet government. The following year, Polish workers formed an independent labor union called Solidarity. Led by Lech Walesa, Solidarity demanded greater freedom for the Polish people. Instead of permitting a more open society, Polish authorities, backed by Moscow, arrested Walesa and abolished Solidarity.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Reagan refused to accept the widespread belief that the Cold War was a permanent geopolitical reality and that the Soviet Union was an indestructible adversary. He had a deep aversion for communism, believing it denied basic human rights. Even more importantly, Reagan had a life-long conviction that the United States was an exceptional nation with a mission to use its power and influence to advance the cause of freedom.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_287"/>B.</strong></span><strong>THE “EVIL EMPIRE”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The collapse of détente chilled relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Shortly after taking office, President Reagan charged that the Soviets were aggressors who “reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, and to cheat.” Using a well-known term from the popular <em>Star Wars</em> movie series, he later called the Soviet Union “an evil empire” responsible for the renewal of Cold War tensions.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Soviet actions in Afghanistan and Poland convinced many Americans that the United States needed a much more aggressive approach in the Cold War. The Reagan Doctrine met this need by pledging the United States would oppose the global influence of the Soviet Union by supporting anti-communist movements. For example, the Reagan administration supplied Afghan fighters with sophisticated anti-aircraft Stinger missiles. The president also sent U.S. troops into the small Caribbean island nation of Grenada to oust a pro-Marxist government that appeared to be forging ties with Russian and Cuba.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Reagan Doctrine led to a massive military buildup. Between 1980 and 1985, U.S. defense budgets increased from $144 billion to $295 billion. In 1983, President Reagan proposed a Strategic Defense Initiative as an added check on Soviet nuclear capability. Reagan envisioned creating a space-based missile defense system capable of striking down nuclear missiles before they could reach the United States. The press promptly called Reagan’s plan “Star Wars,” by then a popular cultural reference point.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>“NEW THINKING”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Reagan’s military buildup forced the Soviets into an expensive arms race they could not afford. Mikhail Gorbachev, the new Soviet leader, concluded his country’s troubled economy could no longer bear the cost of an accelerating arms race with the United States. Shortly after taking power in 1985, he announced his intention to pursue a foreign policy based on “new thinking.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Reagan’s assertive policies did not rule out tactical flexibility. He tested Gorbachev’s commitment to stressing diplomacy over force in a series of five summit meetings. In December 1987, Gorbachev became the first Soviet leader in 14 years to visit the United States. The two leaders opened a new era in superpower relations by signing the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty banning nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles. This marked the first time Washington and Moscow agreed to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_288"/>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHES AT THE BERLIN WALL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On June 26, 1963, President Kennedy delivered a speech in West Berlin in which he resolutely proclaimed, “All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words, ‘Ich bin ein Berliner.’ ” Kennedy’s speech underscored America’s support for West Berlin just 22 months after the construction of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On June 12, 1987, President Reagan delivered a speech in West Berlin in which he resolutely proclaimed, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” Reagan’s speech underscored America’s support for freedom and human rights. Later in his speech, Reagan predicted the “[wall] cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Vice President George H. W. Bush proved to be a strong presidential candidate. Supported by Sun Belt voters, he easily defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As Bush took office, the winds of change continued to sweep across Eastern Europe. The Polish government legalized Solidarity in April 1989. Just four months later, Polish voters elected a non-communist prime minister, marking the first time since the Russian Revolution a communist regime had been peacefully turned out of office.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>“THE WALL IS GONE!”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A stunning series of historic events quickly followed the Polish elections. Emboldened by Gorbachev’s refusal to use military force to support repressive Eastern European regimes, East Germans began holding huge protest demonstrations to demand freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The unthinkable occurred on November 9, 1989, when a new East German leader opened the Berlin Wall. As an amazed world watched on television, jubilant Berliners slammed hammers into the wall, smashing the despised symbol of communist oppression into small concrete souvenirs. Less than one year later, the United States, Soviet Union, and the nations of Europe accepted German reunification.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_289"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The winds of change soon battered the Soviet Union. As central controls loosened, nationalist groups in the fourteen republics surrounding the Russian Republic demanded greater control over their internal affairs. Gorbachev watched helplessly as his authority weakened and his popularity plummeted.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned his position as the leader of a country that ceased to exist. Fifteen independent republics, the largest of which was Russia, replaced the now defunct Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW WORLD ORDER</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Bush hailed the collapse of the Soviet Union as the beginning of what he called a “new world order.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Bush echoed ideas expressed by President Wilson during the First World War when he pledged to work for “a world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Cold War relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were often tense, but nonetheless stable. The Soviet Union left the United States as the world’s only superpower. It also left the United States searching for a new foreign policy.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>President Bush wanted America to support a “new world order” based upon international cooperation. A crisis in the Persian Gulf tested this goal.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SADDAM HUSSEIN AND KUWAIT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On August 2, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein shocked the world by ordering his army to invade neighboring Kuwait. Catching the oil-rich emirate by surprise, Iraq’s army easily overran Kuwait.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Conquering Kuwait was part of a much larger plan. Hussein dreamed of becoming the Middle East’s most powerful Arab leader. Kuwait owned almost 10 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves. Since Iraq also had 10 percent, taking Kuwait would double its oil <span id="page_290"/>reserves. Hussein would then be in a position to intimidate Saudi Arabia and dominate the global oil market.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>BUSH RESPONDS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Bush recognized that the United States could not allow any nation to dominate the Persian Gulf and thus control the world’s oil supply. He also argued that the United States had to stand up to Iraq to deter other would-be aggressors.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Bush successfully forged an international coalition to stop Hussein. The UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding that Iraq withdraw its forces by January 15, 1991. When Hussein refused, Bush ordered a massive air offensive called Operation Desert Storm that destroyed Iraq’s air defense centers and cut its supply lines.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The ground assault began on February 24, 1991. In the largest land operation since World War II, coalition forces smashed through Iraqi defenses and liberated Kuwait.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>AFTERMATH OF THE PERSIAN GULF WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Despite winning an overwhelming military victory, President Bush chose not to press for Hussein’s removal from power. This decision would have fateful consequences a dozen years later.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Victory in the Persian Gulf War lifted Bush’s approval rating to nearly 90 percent. However, Bush could not maintain this lofty level as dissatisfaction with his decision to raise taxes eroded public support. Helped along by a brief but sharp recession in 1990-91, Bill Clinton ended the Reagan-Bush era in the 1992 presidential election, returning the Democrats to the White House.</p>
