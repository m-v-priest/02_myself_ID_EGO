<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The 1950s witnessed the beginning of an unprecedented quarter century of sustained economic growth. In just one generation, the American people moved from the depths of the Great Depression to enjoying the highest standard of living the world had ever known.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Historian James T. Patterson asserts that America’s booming economy was “the most decisive force in shaping attitudes and experiences in the postwar era.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>COLD WAR DEFENSE SPENDING</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The military budget provided the single most important stimulus for postwar economic expansion. America’s commitment to contain the Soviet Union in Europe and fight the Korean War in Asia pushed the defense budget from $13 billion in 1949 to over $50 billion in 1953.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Defense spending played an important role in spurring economic growth in parts of the South and West Coast.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE BABY BOOM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>America’s thriving economy provided jobs and income renewing people’s faith in the future. More and more Americans married at younger ages. By 1956, the average age of marriage for men dropped to 22 and to 20 for women.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The marriage boom triggered a postwar surge in the birth rate known as the baby boom. More than 40 million babies were born in the 1950s, with 4.3 million in the peak year of 1957.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Dozens of industries profited from the baby boom. In 1958, <em>Life</em> magazine calculated that during its first year a baby was “a <span id="page_244"/>potential market for $800.00 worth of products.” For example, the legions of new babies annually consumed 1.5 billion cans of baby food.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CONSUMER SPENDING</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Rising affluence promoted a zeal for consumer products. The widespread use of credit cards created a powerful stimulus for shopping and borrowing. In 1945, the entire country contained just 8 shopping centers. Fifteen years later, 3,840 shopping centers lined the nation’s highways.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Suburban homeowners equipped their kitchens with new refrigerators, washing machines, and dishwashers—but television sets dominated their living rooms. Using techniques pioneered on radio, advertisers sponsored popular programs such as <em>I Love Lucy</em> and <em>Father Knows Best</em> so they could broadcast commercials designed to stimulate demand for products ranging from cars to toothpaste.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: POVERTY IN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1950s, most commentators focused on describing the familiar lifestyle of middle-class Americans. As a result, they ignored the continuing persistence of pockets of poverty in the rural South, Appalachia, the inner cities, and among agricultural workers in the West.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>This lack of public attention changed when Michael Harrington published <em>The Other America</em> in 1962. Harrington described what other social observers had missed—that about 25 percent of the nation’s 176 million people lived in poverty. “How long,” he asked, “shall we ignore this underdeveloped nation in our midst?” Harrington’s compelling description of the plight of impoverished Americans played an important role in inspiring President Johnson’s War on Poverty.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MASS PRODUCTION OF HOMES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>William Levitt successfully applied assembly line production techniques learned in the automobile and shipping industries to building homes in Long Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Levitt’s affordable mass-produced homes provided a model for builders across the country.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_245"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The G.I. Bill enabled World War II veterans to buy new homes with little or no down payments and low long-term interest rates. It also allowed over one million men to go to college and therefore become white-collar workers who boosted economic growth.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Much of the suburban growth occurred in an arc of states stretching from the Carolinas to Florida and on to Texas and Southern California. Known as the Sun Belt, this region steadily gained political, economic, and cultural influence.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Promoted by President Eisenhower, the landmark Federal Highway Act of 1956 created a 42,000-mile system of multiple-lane interstate highways.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The new interstates enabled suburbanites to commute from their homes to their jobs in the cities. At the same time they sparked sustained growth in the automobile, petroleum, and trucking industries, while also fostering an on-the-road culture featuring motels like Holiday Inn and fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE REVIVAL OF THE CULT OF DOMESTICITY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The 1950s witnessed a dramatic revival of the cult of domesticity. By the end of the decade, nearly three-fourths of all American women between the ages of 20 and 24 were married. Youthful marriages and a soaring birth rate encouraged a return to traditional gender roles in which men pursued careers and women devoted themselves to housework and raising their children.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The mass media reinforced and idealized the new cult of domesticity. Television programs featured suburban homes filled with happy moms who maintained immaculate kitchens while their husbands commuted to relatively stress-free white-collar jobs.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: WHAT ARE MOTHERS FOR?</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the popular television series <em>Leave It to Beaver</em>, young Beaver Cleaver admired his mom’s ability to resolve problems saying, “When we’re in a mess, you kind of make things seem not so messy.” Beaver’s mom, June Cleaver, knowingly replied, “Well isn’t that sort of what mothers are for?”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The endless routine of shopping, cooking, and chauffeuring kids frustrated many college-educated women. Bored and isolated, they searched for a very different answer to June Cleaver’s question. In 1963, a suburban mom named Betty Friedan struck a nerve when <span id="page_246"/>she opened her book <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> by asking, “Is this all?” The question and Friedan’s call for women to pursue fulfilling work outside their homes touched a sense of restless dissatisfaction that helped ignite a second wave of feminism in the United States.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The new suburban lifestyle did not enjoy unanimous approval. Social critics decried mass-produced Levittowns packed with endless rows of identical box houses.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>By 1959, 200 corporations controlled 50 percent of the nation’s business assets. A growing number of social scientists worried that many white-collar employees were becoming nameless, interchangeable cogs in vast impersonal corporations.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SOCIAL CRITICS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>William H. Whyte’s book <em>The Organization Man</em> described how the corporate emphasis upon “the Team” created a stifling conformity that squelched personal identity. <em>The Lonely Crowd</em> by Harvard sociologist David Riesman extended Whyte’s critique by arguing that America’s corporate culture produced “other-directed” employees who prized getting along above taking individual risks.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Novelists also joined the chorus of critics who found flaws in an economy dominated by impersonal corporations. For example, Sloan Wilson’s novel <em>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</em> tells the story of a young couple, Tom and Betsy Rath, who struggle against the pervasive pressures of middle-class conformity. The book’s title comes from Tom’s sudden realization that “all I could see was a lot of bright young men in gray flannel suits rushing around New York in a frantic parade to nowhere.” Tom then looks at himself and is aghast to discover that he too is wearing a gray flannel suit.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE BEAT GENERATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1950s, a small but culturally influential group of self-described “Beats” rejected suburban America’s carefree consumption and mindless conformity. Easily identified by their unconventional long hair and distaste for “square” suburban lifestyles, the Beats preferred to live in urban enclaves in New York City and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_247"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Beat generation writers and poets such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac scorned middle-class suburban life. Kerouac linked happiness with personal freedom. Like other Beats he celebrated impulsive actions and the pursuit of immediate pleasure. In his autobiographical novel <em>On the Road</em>, Kerouac wrote “spontaneous prose” describing how he found adventure and renewal while traveling across the country. The Beats pioneered a nonconformist lifestyle foreshadowing the emergence of the hippies in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>ARTISTIC REBELS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Like contemporary Beat writers, Modern artists pursued a personal quest for radical freedom of expression. Instead of attempting to portray the world around them, mid-century Modernists stressed private concerns and personal experiences as the sources of their art. During the 1950s, New York City became the center of the Western art world.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko emerged as the acknowledged leaders of the New York School of Abstract Expressionism. Pollock created Abstract Expressionist paintings by spontaneously dripping paint on a canvas spread across the floor. He believed this artistic style emphasized individuality and freedom from traditional constraints.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>ROCK AND ROLL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Relatively few Americans read Beat Generation poems or visited trendy art galleries to see Abstract Expressionist paintings. However, most Americans did listen to music on their radios. In 1951, a Cleveland disc jockey named Alan Freed discarded bland popular music and instead began to play black rhythm and blues artists. Freed renamed the new sound “rock and roll.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Elvis Presley embodied the new rock and roll sound and its rebellious attitude. His hit songs and sexually suggestive onstage gyrations thrilled teenagers and horrified their parents. Like Beat Generation writers, rock and roll singers challenged accepted beliefs about sex, race, and work. Rock and roll soon became the sound that helped shape and define the new teenage culture.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the 1896 <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that racially separate facilities, if equal, did not violate the Constitution. According to the Court, segregation was not discrimination.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Despite the Double V Campaign and the desegregation of the Army, Jim Crow segregation remained entrenched throughout the South. Ubiquitous “Colored Only” signs provided African Americans with humiliating reminders of their second-class status.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Since its founding in 1909, the NAACP had adopted the strategy of filing legal cases to gain justice and civil rights for African Americans. Led by Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP’s Legal Defense and Education Fund won important Supreme Court victories ruling against “separate but equal” facilities in graduate and professional schools.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>“THE DOCTRINE OF ‘SEPARATE BUT EQUAL’ HAS NO PLACE”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When the 1953–54 school year opened, 2.5 million African American children attended all-black public schools in twenty-one states, ten of them outside the Old South. The facilities in these segregated schools were far from equal to those in white schools. In 1954, Southern states spent an average of $165.00 for their white students and $115.00 for their black students.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP legal team chose five test cases to challenge state laws mandating segregation in the public schools. The <em>Brown</em> case took its name from the first name on the list—Oliver Brown of Topeka, Kansas. Brown wanted his eight-year-old daughter Linda to attend a nearby all-white elementary school instead of the all-black school twenty-five blocks from their home.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Marshall argued that segregated schools violated the “equal protection of the laws” guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Earl Warren declared, “We conclude that in the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The <em>Brown</em> decision opened a new era in the African American struggle for equal rights. The Court’s landmark ruling galvanized <span id="page_249"/>the nation’s 15 million black citizens to begin demanding “Freedom Now!”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MASSIVE RESISTANCE AND LITTLE ROCK</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Outraged leaders across the South called for “massive resistance” to the Court’s desegregation ruling. In Congress, 82 representatives and 19 senators signed a Southern Manifesto accusing the Supreme Court of “a clear abuse of judicial power.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Massive resistance became a reality in Little Rock, Arkansas. The local school board adopted a desegregation plan calling for nine black students to integrate Little Rock’s Central High School. The crisis began when an angry white mob surrounded the school and threatened the safety of the nine black students.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>This blatant display of resistance convinced President Eisenhower that he had a constitutional duty to enforce the <em>Brown</em> decision. Ike ordered 1,100 paratroopers to Little Rock to protect the black students and enforce the Supreme Court’s desegregation order. Eisenhower thus became the first president since Reconstruction to use federal troops to enforce the rights of African Americans.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: THE IMPACT OF THE <em>BROWN</em> DECISION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Although the <em>Brown</em> decision initially faced “massive resistance” in the South, it provided irresistible moral legitimacy to the struggle for legal equality. Sparked by <em>Brown</em>, the modern civil rights movement began a crucial decade of mass protests culminating with the passage of the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span><em>Brown</em>’s original goal of achieving school desegregation became part of a larger campaign for social justice. The African American civil rights movement inspired women, people with disabilities, and other minority groups to also demand “equal protection of the laws.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On December 1, 1955, a white Montgomery City Lines bus driver ordered a 42-year-old black seamstress named Rosa Parks to give up her seat to a white passenger. Parks refused by firmly saying one fateful word, “No.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Rosa Parks’ refusal to give up her seat sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Led by her young minister, the 26-year-old Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the black community supported Parks by boycotting the city buses. The boycott ended 15 months later when the Supreme Court ruled that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>DR. KING AND NONVIOLENT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Montgomery Bus Boycott catapulted Dr. King to national prominence. He soon emerged as America’s foremost civil rights leader.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Dr. King inspired his followers with a message of nonviolent civil disobedience derived from Henry David Thoreau’s essay “Resistance to Civil Government.” In this seminal work, Thoreau wrote that if a law requires a person “to be an agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law.” Dr. King founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to apply this moral principle of civil disobedience in test cases throughout the South.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SIT-IN MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Despite the victories in Montgomery and Little Rock, segregation continued to be a humiliating fact of daily life throughout the South. Jim Crow laws still segregated public bathrooms, drinking fountains, and lunch counters.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Dr. King’s philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience inspired four black college students in Greensboro, North Carolina, to take action. Calling segregation “evil pure and simple,” the Greensboro Four sat down at a “whites only” Woolworth lunch counter on February 1, 1960, and ordered cups of coffee and slices of apple pie. When the waitress refused to take their order, the students remained seated. Their “sit-in” tactic worked. After losing over $200,000 in business, the Greensboro Woolworth desegregated its lunch counter.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_251"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>The Greensboro sit-in energized a wave of student protests across the South. An estimated 70,000 demonstrators held “read-ins” in libraries, “watch-ins” at movie theaters, and “wade-ins” at beaches. Encouraged by Ella Baker, black and white students formed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to facilitate student activism.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>“A MULTIPLICITY OF FEARS”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On the surface, a majority of Americans seemed to enjoy a good life in the mid-fifties. The country liked Ike because his administration brought a material prosperity unequalled in American history.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The surface appearance of calm belied the reality of an underlying sense of anxiety and even fear. In a press conference in 1954, Eisenhower noted that Americans were “suffering from a multiplicity of fears.” The president was right. The fear of international communism, the fear of domestic subversion, and, most of all, the fear of nuclear annihilation all produced a deep sense of anxiety.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MASSIVE RETALIATION AND BRINKSMANSHIP</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The fear of war was not imaginary. By 1954, both the United States and the Soviet Union had exploded hydrogen bombs. What Winston Churchill called the “balance of terror” seemed frighteningly real.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>President Eisenhower and his Secretary of State John Foster Dulles added to public anxiety by announcing the United States would no longer become involved in expensive limited wars. Instead, Dulles declared a new strategy called massive retaliation. This meant the United States would consider using its arsenal of nuclear weapons to halt Soviet aggression.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Threatening to use nuclear weapons would require nerves of steel. “If you are scared to go to the brink,” Dulles warned, “you are lost.” Journalists promptly labeled this policy of going to the brink of nuclear war without going over the edge “brinksmanship.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>VIETNAM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Most Americans knew very little about Vietnam. Yet, events in this remote Asian country would transform it and the United States.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_252"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Following World War II, France attempted to regain control over its valuable colonies in what had been known as French Indochina. However, the French soon became entangled in a costly war with communist forces led by Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1954, the French suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The exhausted French and the victorious Vietnamese reached an agreement known as the Geneva Accords. Both sides agreed to divide Vietnam at the 17th parallel. Ho Chi Minh would rule north of the parallel, while a French-backed government would rule south of it. A final agreement specified that free elections would be held in 1956 to unify Vietnam under one government.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE DOMINO THEORY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The French defeat forced Eisenhower to make a fateful decision. Ike refused to abandon South Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh. At a news conference he explained, “When you have a row of dominoes set up, you knock over the first one, and what happens to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly. So you could have the beginning of a disintegration that will have the most profound consequences.” Called the domino theory, this belief became the justification for America’s involvement in Vietnam.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The election called for in the Geneva Accords never took place. Instead, the U.S. sponsored a new South Vietnamese government headed by Ngo Dinh Diem. Within a short time, South Vietnamese communists called Viet Cong began a guerilla war to overthrow Diem. Eisenhower’s decision to protect South Vietnam left his successors a dangerous problem.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong><em>SPUTNIK</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On October 4, 1957, millions of Americans turned on their television sets and heard a newscaster tell them, “Listen now for the sound which forever separates the old from the new.” The beeping sound they heard came from a 184-pound satellite called <em>Sputnik</em> (Russian for “traveling companion”) that the Russians had shot into orbit earlier that day.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span><em>Sputnik</em> jolted America’s self-confidence. A stunned public concluded that the Russians had surpassed the United States in science and technology.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In July 1958, an alarmed Congress created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to compete with the Soviet space program. Congress also passed the National Defense <span id="page_253"/>Education Act to fund accelerated science and math programs in the nation’s public schools and universities.</p>

The decade also marked the beginning of the radio age. At the same time, Henry Ford pioneered mass production techniques for the automobile.
