<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Spanish carved out a vast New World empire that stretched from what is today New Mexico to Peru. They built impressive cathedrals in Mexico City and Lima and even opened universities in both of these cities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As the seventeenth century opened, France and England had yet to establish permanent colonies in the rest of North America.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Influenced by different economic and imperial goals, the French and English founded very contrasting colonies in North America.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF FRENCH NORTH AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Explored by sea captains looking for a northwest passage to Asia.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Settled by traders and trappers who developed a lucrative fur trade with the Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Included Canada, the entire Mississippi River Valley, and Louisiana.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Christianized by Jesuit priests who did not require Native American converts to move to missions. The French enjoyed generally cooperative relations with Native American tribes.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Populated primarily by male trappers who lived and worked in widely scattered trading posts.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF BRITISH NORTH AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Settled by a variety of migrants who sought social mobility, economic prosperity, and religious freedom. Religious motives played a dominant role in the New England colonies, while economic motives played a dominant role in the Chesapeake colonies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Included a long but narrow line of settlements stretching along the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to Georgia.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Exhibited initial tolerance for the Native American tribes. However, peaceful relations quickly deteriorated as wars broke out due to conflicts over land and culture.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_28"/>4<span class="C344">.</span>Populated by families living in compact communities in New England and widely scattered plantations and farms in the Chesapeake region. Young single males initially played a greater role in the Chesapeake colonies. English colonists rarely intermarried with Native Americans.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT ON NATIVE AMERICANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Old World diseases and warfare decimated the Native American tribes.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>British conflicts with Native American Indians over land, resources, and political boundaries led to military confrontations such as the Powhatan War in Virginia and King Philip’s War in New England.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Native American tribes attempted to survive by utilizing European material goods and forming temporary alliances with the French and English.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>KEY FACTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jamestown was founded in 1607 by a joint-stock company to make a profit.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Religion played a minor role in the founding of Jamestown.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The scarcity of women and the high rate of men’s mortality strengthened the socio-economic status of women in the Chesapeake colonies.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Virginia’s House of Burgesses was the first representative legislative assembly in British North America.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Lord Baltimore founded Maryland as a refuge for his fellow Roman Catholics. The Act of Religious Toleration (1649) was intended to protect the minority rights of Catholics in Maryland from religious persecution by Protestants. The Act was repealed after the Glorious Revolution.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_29"/>B.</strong></span><strong>TOBACCO</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jamestown tottered on the brink of collapse as about 80 percent of its first colonists died from diseases and malnutrition.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Tobacco enabled the Chesapeake colonies to become economically viable.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The profitable cultivation of tobacco created a demand for a large and inexpensive labor force.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Chesapeake Bay planters initially used indentured servants from England.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Between 1607 and 1676, indentured servants comprised the chief source of agricultural labor in the Chesapeake colonies.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>BACON’S REBELLION, 1676</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Bacon’s Rebellion exposed tensions between the former indentured servants, who were poor, and the gentry (the genteel class of planters), who were rich.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As planters became more wary of their former indentured servants, they turned to enslaved Africans as a more reliable and cost-effective source of labor.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Fertile land, a warm climate, abundant rainfall, and a long growing season enabled ambitious planters to grow tobacco, rice, and indigo as cash crops.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Numerous navigable rivers provided convenient and inexpensive routes to transport goods to Atlantic ports such as Norfolk, Charleston, and Savannah.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMIC FACTORS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Tobacco saved the Chesapeake colonies. As demand in England increased, tobacco production soared from 4 barrels in 1614 to 10 million pounds in 1670.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Tobacco required a large supply of inexpensive labor. The spread of tobacco cultivation beyond the Chesapeake colonies created additional demand for slave labor.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_30"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>Indentured servants proved to be both unreliable and rebellious.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>In 1662, Virginia changed its laws regarding slavery; from that point, slavery became a lifelong, inheritable status. As such, the value of slaves increased over time.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Following Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), planters began to replace indentured servants with imported African slaves. The number of enslaved Africans in Virginia rose from 300 in 1650 to 150,000 or 40 percent of the colony’s 1750 population.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>SOCIAL FACTORS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A small but powerful group of wealthy planters dominated Southern society.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although the majority of white families in the South did not own slaves, they did aspire to become slave owners.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Impoverished whites felt superior to black slaves, thus providing support for the slave system.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Few seventeenth- and eighteenth-century white colonists questioned human bondage as morally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Resistance to slavery proved to be futile. Following the Stono Rebellion (1739), the South Carolina legislature enacted strict laws prohibiting slaves from assembling in groups, earning money, and learning to read. Other southern states followed South Carolina’s example as laws defined the descendants of African American mothers as black and therefore enslaved for perpetuity.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Puritans were Protestants who wanted to reform or “purify” the Church of England. They renounced elaborate rituals and argued that a hierarchy of religious leaders was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Puritans left England to escape political repression, religious restrictions, and an economic recession.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_31"/>B.</strong></span><strong>“CITY UPON A HILL”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Puritans had a powerful sense of mission—to build an ideal Christian society.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>John Winthrop’s famous “City Upon a Hill” sermon expressed the Puritan belief that they had a special pact with God to build a model Christian society:</p>
<p class="C436"><em>“For we must consider that we shall be a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we shall have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word throughout the world.”</em></p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Making Connections</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Winthrop’s sermon is often cited as the first example of American exceptionalism, the belief that America has a mission to be a beacon of democratic reform.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>President Reagan often used the image of a “shining city” to express his ideal of an America “God-blessed and teeming with peoples of all kinds living in harmony and peace.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>RELIGIOUS DISSENTERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Religion occupied a central position in Puritan society. Convinced that they were doing God’s work, the Puritans emphasized religious conformity. Although the Puritans came to America for religious freedom, they did not tolerate outspoken religious dissenters.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Puritans banished Anne Hutchinson because of her unorthodox religious views. Hutchinson challenged the subordinate role of women in Puritan society and boldly challenged the clergy’s sole ability to interpret the Bible, insisting that “The power of the Holy Spirit dwelleth perfectly in every believer.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Making Connections</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Hutchinson’s willingness to publicly proclaim her views can be compared with abolitionist women in the 1840s who also asserted their right to speak on behalf of a cause.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Hutchinson’s emphasis upon personal salvation was later echoed in the Second Great Awakening of the 1830s.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Puritans banished Roger Williams for his unorthodox religious and political views. Williams championed the cause of religious toleration and freedom of thought. He advocated the separation of church and state, arguing that the state was an inappropriate <span id="page_32"/>organization to interfere in matters of faith. Williams founded the Rhode Island colony based upon freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The Puritans were unable to stamp out religious dissent. Ironically, religious intolerance in Massachusetts Bay promoted religious tolerance in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>PURITAN SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Puritans typically migrated to New England in family groups rather than as single individuals.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Puritans typically lived in compact villages clustered around a community meeting house where they met to worship and discuss local issues. These town meetings provided important experience in self-government.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Puritans established a patriarchal society in which women and children played a subordinate role.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Puritans valued education as a means to read and understand the Bible. They required each community of 50 or more families to provide a teacher of reading and writing. They founded Harvard College to ensure an adequate supply of trained ministers.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Puritan communities strove for a close relationship between civil and religious authorities. Puritan ministers and magistrates enforced a strict code of moral conduct.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>RELATIONS WITH NATIVE AMERICANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Puritans did not settle in an uninhabited wilderness. As many as 100,000 Indians lived in New England.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In the beginning, the coastal Indians taught the newcomers how to plant corn. The native people welcomed the opportunity to exchange furs and food for manufactured goods.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>As the Puritans grew in number and strength, they expanded their settlements and began to see the native peoples as a “savage people, who are cruel, barbarous, and most treacherous.” Given this new hostile attitude, conflict soon erupted in 1636 when the New Englanders destroyed a Pequot village slaughtering almost 400 people.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Smallpox epidemics soon decimated the Indian population. By 1675 the population of southern New England tribes fell to below 20,000 people.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Surviving Indian leaders realized that the English settlers intended to “deprive us of the privileges of our land and drive us to utter <span id="page_33"/>ruin.” In 1675, led by Chief Metacom (also known as King Philip), Indians attacked and burned settlements across Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>King Philip’s War caused great destruction. The war claimed the lives of about 1,000 settlers or one-tenth of the colony’s male population. In addition, Metacom’s followers destroyed 12 villages and heavily damaged 52 others.</p>
<p class="C369">7<span class="C344">.</span>King Philip’s War had an even greater destructive impact upon the native people, leaving at least 3,000 dead. The survivors were a broken people, living on the social margins of a land that had irrevocably changed.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Middle Atlantic colonies enjoyed moderate winters, fertile soil, fine harbors, and a longer growing season than the New England colonies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers enabled early settlers to tap into the lucrative interior fur trade. They also enabled merchants to develop thriving commercial ports in Philadelphia and New York City.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>PENNSYLVANIA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a “Holy Experiment” that would serve as a refuge for Quakers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Penn created an unusually liberal colony that included a representative assembly elected by the landowners.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Pennsylvania granted freedom of religion and, similar to the colony of Rhode Island, did not have a state-supported church.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Penn launched an aggressive advertising campaign that attracted a diverse mix of ethnic and religious groups. By 1700, only Virginia and Massachusetts had larger populations.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>QUAKERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Quakers were pacifists who refused to bear arms.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Quakers advocated freedom of worship and accepted a greater role for women in church services.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Quakers opposed slavery and were among America’s first abolitionists.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Virginia’s fertile soil, warm weather, and wide navigable rivers all promoted the cultivation of tobacco as a cash crop.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Massachusetts’ rocky soil, cold winters, and short, fast-moving rivers all precluded the growth of plantation agriculture. Instead, small farms grew a healthy mix of crops. The cold weather checked the spread of contagious diseases, thus prolonging life expectancy. A Massachusetts colonist who survived childhood could expect to live to 70, about 25 years longer than a comparable colonist in Virginia.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Virginia was founded by a joint-stock company to make a profit.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Massachusetts was founded by Pilgrims and Puritans committed to building a model Christian society.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>TYPES OF ECONOMIES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Virginia developed an agricultural economy based upon the cultivation of tobacco as a cash crop. Planters initially used indentured servants, but then turned to enslaved Africans. Virginia’s plantation-based economy created a significant disparity in wealth and power between an elite group of tidewater gentry and a much larger group of small farmers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Massachusetts developed a diversified economy that was based upon small farms, shipbuilding, and fishing. The colony imported very few indentured servants or enslaved Africans. It was initially dominated by Puritan ministers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Virginia colony began by establishing peaceful relations with the far more numerous and powerful Powhatan Confederacy.
