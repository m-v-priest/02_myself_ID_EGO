<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1890, the United States still played a minor role in the game of global power politics. With the exception of its Revolutionary War alliance with France, America carefully followed Washington’s admonition to avoid becoming entangled in foreign alliances. For most of the nineteenth century, America had been a continental republic focused on settling the western frontier and building democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In less than a decade America became an imperial republic with interests in the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Pacific. The speed of this change astonished President McKinley. The proud but perhaps slightly perplexed president correctly observed that “in a few short months we have become a world power.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE QUEST FOR NEW MARKETS AND RAW MATERIALS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>American business leaders worried that they were producing more products than Americans could buy. Many corporate executives looked to Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific for new markets and new sources of raw materials.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The deep depression from 1893 to 1897 exerted a powerful influence on American political leaders. Fearing renewed labor unrest, they linked economic growth and social stability to their quest for foreign markets and raw materials.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ALFRED MAHAN AND THE NEW STRATEGIC THINKING</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In his seminal book <em>The Influence of Sea Power upon History</em>, Captain Alfred T. Mahan argued that control of the sea shaped the destinies of history’s greatest empires. He forcefully argued that the United States must build a powerful oceangoing navy, construct a canal across the isthmus to link the East Coast with the Pacific, and acquire strategically located colonies to provide coaling stations and repair facilities for its military and commercial fleets.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_184"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Mahan’s ideas influenced a generation of American policy makers led by Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge. As a result, his views on the importance of sea power became the cornerstone of American strategic thinking.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE IDEOLOGY OF EXPANSION: SOCIAL DARWINISM AND THE WHITE MAN’S BURDEN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Social Darwinists believed that Darwin’s theory of the survival of the fittest could be applied to the rise and fall of nations. During the late nineteenth century, strong European powers led by England, France, and Germany began to dominate weak nations in Africa and Asia. Proponents of expansion warned that the United States had to play a more aggressive role in world affairs. If the U.S. failed to accept this challenge, it risked falling behind its rivals in the global race for markets and natural resources.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Americans believed in the inherent superiority of their political and economic systems. During most of the nineteenth century, America fulfilled its Manifest Destiny by spreading its civilization from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Now America had a responsibility articulated by the British poet Rudyard Kipling to “take up the White Man’s Burden” and embark on a mission to “civilize non-Europeans.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTINUITIES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Manifest Destiny and American imperialism both led to territorial expansion and the acquisition of natural resources and new markets.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Both Manifest Destiny and imperialism led to military conflicts. The war with Mexico resulted in the acquisition of California and the New Mexico Territory. The war with Spain resulted in the acquisition of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CHANGES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The United States did not justify its expansion across the continent as a mission to civilize Native Americans. In contrast, American expansionists and missionaries embraced the notion of a white man’s burden to justify imperialist actions.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_185"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1840s and ’50s, the United States spread into a sparsely populated territory that was being settled by waves of migrants from other states. In contrast, during the age of imperialism the United States took possession of densely populated lands inhabited by populations with different ethnic backgrounds and cultural traditions.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE MARCH TO WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Cuban rebels waged a guerilla war against Spanish rule. The Spanish commander Valeriano Weyler herded Cubans into detention centers in a brutal attempt to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Joseph Pulitzer’s <em>New York World</em> and William Randolph Hearst’s <em>New York Journal</em> were locked in a furious circulation war for readers. Both papers published daily stories about the atrocities committed by “Butcher” Weyler. Known as yellow journalism, these sensational stories sparked widespread public indignation against Spain.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The 7,000-ton <em>U.S.S. Maine</em>, the navy’s newest battleship, arrived in Havana harbor on January 25, 1898, on what Washington called a visit of “friendly courtesy.” Three weeks later a deafening explosion tore through the vessel, sinking the ship and killing over 260 sailors. Although the cause of the blast was never fully determined, the press and most Americans blamed the Spanish.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: WAR AND PEACE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1799 America and France approached the brink of war. As a wave of war hysteria swept across the nation, President Adams’ popularity soared. Militant Federalists led by Alexander Hamilton urged Adams to ask Congress for a declaration of war. But Adams resisted pressure from his party and the public. Instead of asking for war, he ordered American envoys in Paris to make a final effort to reach an agreement with the French government. They did and America avoided war.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_186"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1898 America and Spain approached the brink of war. As a wave of war hysteria swept across the nation, President McKinley’s popularity soared. Militant Republicans led by Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge urged McKinley to ask Congress for a declaration of war. Even though Spain yielded to almost every American demand, McKinley decided that the political risk of ignoring an aroused public was too high. On April 11, 1898, he sent a war message to Congress urging armed intervention in Cuba.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>“A SPLENDID LITTLE WAR”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Hostilities in what Secretary of State John Hay called “a splendid little war” lasted just 114 days. The United States suffered minimal casualties as it quickly defeated Spanish forces in the Philippines and Cuba.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In a famous battle, Lieutenant-Colonel Theodore Roosevelt led a volunteer regiment known as the “Rough Riders” in a dramatic charge up San Juan Hill. Now a war hero, TR was soon elected governor of New York.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The war marked the end of Spain’s once vast New World empire.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The war marked the emergence of the United States as a world power.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Treaty of Paris ceded Puerto Rico and Guam to the United States. Spain agreed to cede the Philippine Islands to the United States for $20 million. This marked the first time that the United States acquired overseas territory. The war also gave McKinley a pretext to annex Hawaii.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Teller Amendment guaranteed that the United States would respect Cuba’s sovereignty as an independent nation. However, in 1901, Congress made the withdrawal of U.S. troops contingent upon Cuba’s acceptance of the Platt Amendment. This amendment prohibited Cuba from making any foreign treaties that might “impair” its independence or involve it in a public debt it could not pay. The amendment also gave the United States the right to maintain a naval station at Guantanamo Bay on the southeast corner of Cuba. Incorporated into the Cuban constitution, the Platt Amendment provided legal grounds for repeated American interventions in the island.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE DEBATE OVER THE PHILIPPINES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The provision in the Treaty of Paris ceding the Philippines to the United States aroused a powerful anti-imperialist movement to block ratification of the treaty. The Anti-Imperialist League pointed out the inconsistency between liberating Cuba and annexing the Philippines. They stressed that annexation would violate America’s longstanding commitment to human freedom and rule by the “consent of the governed.” Critics also pointed out that while America’s industrial economy did require markets, this could be accomplished without acquiring colonies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Expansionists countered by arguing that the Philippines would provide a strategic base from which the United States could trade with China. President McKinley also stressed America’s duty “to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them.” Although McKinley’s argument ignored the fact that most Filipinos were already Christians, his views prevailed. After a heated debate, the Senate approved the Treaty of Paris with one vote to spare.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE PHILIPPINE INSURRECTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Despite strong evidence that the Filipinos wanted independence, the McKinley administration decided that they were not ready for self-government. Led by Emilio Aguinaldo, the Filipinos resisted American control of their country.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Called the War for Independence by Filipinos, the Philippine Insurrection foreshadowed the guerrilla wars fought in the twentieth century. After three years of fighting, America’s overwhelming military power finally crushed the rebels.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1916, Congress passed the Jones Act formally committing the United States to eventually granting the Philippines independence. The island nation finally gained its full independence on July 4, 1946.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE OPEN DOOR IN CHINA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>American business leaders looked to China’s “illimitable markets” to spur American economic growth. Strategic coaling stations in <span id="page_188"/>Guam and the Philippines enabled American commercial ships to reach the fabled Chinese market.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1880s and ’90s, Britain, Germany, France, Russia, and Japan all began to carve out spheres of influence in an ever-weakening China. Each power controlled trade, tariffs, harbor duties, and railroad rates within its sphere of influence.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Secretary of State John Hay became increasingly worried that the European powers and Japan would restrict American trading opportunities in China. On September 6, 1899, he dispatched a series of diplomatic notes asking the governments of these nations to respect the rights of other nations within their spheres of influence.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Hay’s Open Door policy was designed to protect American commercial interests in China. The European powers and Japan neither accepted nor rejected Hay’s Open Door Notes. Although America’s Open Door policy had no legal standing, Hay boldly announced that all of the powers had agreed and that their consent was therefore “final and definitive.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE PANAMA CANAL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Theodore Roosevelt, expansionists placed a high priority on the need to construct a canal through Central America. They pointed out that a canal would reduce the 12,000-mile voyage from San Francisco to the East Coast to just 4,000 miles.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>After much debate Congress approved a canal through the Isthmus of Panama. At that time Panama was a province of Colombia. The Colombian Senate appeared to thwart TR’s plan when it rejected America’s offer to pay $10 million for the right to dig a canal across the isthmus.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Colombian refusal did not deter Roosevelt. Rather than continue frustrating negotiations with Colombia, TR implemented his policy that in foreign affairs the President should “speak softly and carry a big stick.”</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Encouraged and supported by Roosevelt, Panama revolted against Colombia and declared itself an independent nation. Roosevelt promptly recognized Panama. He then signed a treaty with the new nation guaranteeing its independence and granting the United States a lease on a ten-mile wide canal zone.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>Construction of the Panama Canal began in 1904. A work force of about 30,000 laborers completed the 51-mile “Big Ditch” in just <span id="page_189"/>ten years. When it opened in 1914, the Panama Canal gave the United States a commanding position in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE ROOSEVELT COROLLARY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The construction of the Panama Canal made the security of the Caribbean a vital American interest.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Dominican Republic confronted TR with a difficult problem. In 1903 the Dominican government stopped payments on its debts of more than $32 million to France and other European powers. Roosevelt feared that the European powers would intervene in the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean nations to collect their debts. Although the nations would come as creditors, Roosevelt worried that they might remain as occupying powers, thus violating the Monroe Doctrine.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>In his annual message to Congress in December 1904, Roosevelt urged Latin American nations to stabilize their finances. He warned that failure to repay their debts would force the United States to intervene by taking over a nation’s customs house and then paying off its debts. Known as the Roosevelt Corollary, this policy extended the Monroe Doctrine by stating that the United States claimed the right to act as an international police power that could unilaterally intervene in Central America and the Caribbean to remedy what TR called “chronic wrongdoing.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Roosevelt Corollary changed the Monroe Doctrine from a statement against the intervention of European powers in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere to a justification for the unrestricted American right to regulate Caribbean affairs. Between 1904 and 1917, Presidents Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson ordered American troops into the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, and Haiti. These repeated interventions protected American interests but antagonized the local populations.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In his inaugural address on March 4, 1933, Franklin Roosevelt repudiated the Roosevelt Corollary declaring, “In the field of World policy, I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor.” The Good Neighbor Policy led to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Nicaragua and Haiti and the annulment of the Platt Amendment with Cuba. The era of the Good Neighbor Policy ended with the onset of the Cold War and America’s need to protect the Western Hemisphere from Soviet influence.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>“NEUTRAL IN FACT AS WELL AS NAME”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The nations of Europe enjoyed an extended period of prosperity and progress in the century following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. But an arms race between Germany and Great Britain, competition for colonies in Africa, and the formation of rival alliances created an atmosphere of tension and suspicion. The assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, set in motion an inexorable chain of events leading to the outbreak of World War I less than six weeks later.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The explosive events in Europe stunned President Wilson. He was now forced to shift his focus from his domestic Progressive agenda to how the United States would respond to the war in Europe. On August 19, 1917, Wilson announced, “The United States must be neutral in fact as well as name.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FREEDOM OF THE SEAS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As a neutral nation, the United States could legally trade with all nations involved in World War I. Enforcing America’s neutral rights proved to be difficult. On May 7, 1915, a German submarine sank the <em>Lusitania</em>, a British passenger liner. Almost 1,200 people died, including 128 Americans. The sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em> forcibly raised the issue of freedom of the seas while also raising the issue of American military preparedness.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Following the sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em>, the Germans pledged not to launch further attacks on merchant vessels without warning. Wilson sternly warned Germany that a violation of this pledge would risk war with the United States.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>On January 31, 1917, Germany announced that it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare. The Germans understood that this action would bring the United States into the war. However, they gambled they could defeat France and Great Britain before America could mobilize, train, and transport an army large enough to thwart their offensive along the Western Front.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>“THE WORLD MUST BE MADE SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Events now pushed the United States to the brink of war. In early February 1917, Wilson broke diplomatic relations with Germany. Less than a month later, the British intercepted a telegram from the German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann to the German <span id="page_191"/>minister in Mexico. The note tried to rekindle Mexican resentment over the loss of its territory to the United States in the Mexican-American War by offering to help Mexico regain its “lost territories in New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Zimmermann telegram and the sinking of several unarmed American ships compelled Wilson to ask a special session of Congress for a declaration of war against Germany. Wilson told Congress that the United States “had no selfish ends to serve” by entering the war. “The world,” Wilson proclaimed, “must be made safe for democracy.”</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Wilson recognized that the American public had to be mobilized to support a war against an enemy that did not represent a direct threat to the nation’s homeland.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Wilson issued an executive order creating a Committee on Public Information. Led by George Creel, the committee used films, posters, and an army of speakers to convince the public that America was fighting a righteous war for freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CIVIL LIBERTIES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Committee on Public Information’s propaganda campaign promoted a national mood of suspicion and distrust. Wilson promised that any disloyalty would be corrected with “a firm hand of stern repression.” Upon the president’s request, Congress passed the Espionage and Sedition Acts outlawing criticism of government leaders and war policies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Designed to curtail constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech and press, the Espionage and Sedition Acts constituted the greatest attack on civil liberties since the Federalist-inspired Sedition Act of 1798. Ironically, while the United States embarked on a crusade to “make the world safe for democracy,” these two acts stifled dissent and encouraged intolerance.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong><em>SCHENCK v. UNITED STATES</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the war, Charles T. Schenck, a member of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia, oversaw the printing and distribution of 15,000 leaflets urging young men to resist the draft. The government promptly charged Schenck with <span id="page_192"/>violating the Espionage Act by obstructing military recruiting. Schenck argued that his actions were protected by the First Amendment guarantee of free speech.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Supreme Court upheld Schenck’s conviction in <em>Schenck v. United States</em>. Speaking for a unanimous court, Justice Holmes declared that government could limit speech if it provokes a “clear and present danger” of substantive evils.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE GREAT MIGRATION</strong></p>

<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The wartime demand for industrial workers encouraged over 400,000 southern blacks to migrate to Northern cities. Known as the Great Migration, this mass movement opened new opportunities for African Americans while also exacerbating racial tensions in many cities.

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The United States successfully raised and trained an army of 4 million men. By the spring of 1918 troopships carried 100,000 American soldiers a month across the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, American food and munitions poured into Europe.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) arrived in time to help block the last great German offensive. Faced with the Allies overwhelming strength, the exhausted Germans accepted the Allied peace offer. All fighting ended at 11:00 am on November 11, 1918.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_193"/>B.</strong></span><strong>DISILLUSIONMENT AT VERSAILLES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The peace conference opened at Versailles, outside Paris, on January 18, 1919. Woodrow Wilson personally led the American delegation.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Wilson came prepared to implement his vision of a just and lasting peace based upon the principles in his Fourteen Points. His fourteenth and most famous point called for a League of Nations that would mediate disputes, supervise arms reduction, and curb aggressor nations through collective military action.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Fourteen Points articulated the hopes of people for a just settlement that would ensure a lasting peace. But Wilson soon faced the grim realities of European power politics. Both Great Britain and France wanted to make Germany pay for the terrible suffering their people endured during the war. The Treaty of Versailles contained the Covenant of the League of Nations, but it also forced Germany to accept full blame for starting the war and pay reparations later set at $33 billion.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Wilson faced a difficult fight to win Senate approval for the Treaty of Versailles. Opponents led by Senate Majority Leader Henry Cabot Lodge objected to the League’s collective security provision arguing that it would limit American sovereignty and undermine the power of Congress in foreign affairs.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Wilson denounced his critics predicting that, “Unless America takes part in this treaty, the World is going to lose heart.” Frustrated by his Senate opponents, Wilson left Washington to take his case to the American people. He traveled 8,000 miles and made 37 speeches in 29 cities, pleading that America is “the Nation upon which the whole world depends to hold the scales of justice even.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Three weeks into the grueling trip Wilson collapsed from exhaustion. A few days later he suffered a severe stroke that partly paralyzed his left side. For weeks he could not sit up or even sign his name.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Senate never approved the Treaty of Versailles and the United States never joined the League of Nations. Wilson left office a beaten and embittered man.</p>
