<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Before the Industrial Revolution, Americans planted crops, wove cloth, and made shoes by hand. The Industrial Revolution in America began in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in the late 1790s and early 1800s. Waterpower, once used only to run tiny grain mills, powered textile machines in Lowell and other nearby New England towns.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Innovations in transportation such as steamboats, the Erie Canal, and the early railroads sparked a market revolution linking once isolated communities into regional trading areas.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>A second Industrial Revolution began in the years following the Civil War. By 1913, the United States produced one-third of the world’s industrial output, more than Great Britain, France, and Germany combined.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: THE CAUSES OF THE SECOND INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Natural Resources</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>The United States was blessed with abundant supplies of coal, iron ore, petroleum, and timber. For example, America had more recoverable coal reserves than any other nation. In addition, the Mesabi Range in Minnesota contained the world’s largest deposits of iron ore.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Coal burns hotter and longer than wood. These qualities made coal a particularly important reason for of America’s surge in industrial production. Prior to the Civil War, wood provided almost half of America’s energy. However, as the Industrial Revolution gathered momentum, America became a mineral-intensive economy based upon coal. American railroads and steamships took the lead in replacing wood with coal. In addition, steel mills used vast quantities of coal to fire their furnaces.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_152"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Human Resources</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Labor was both plentiful and inexpensive. America’s huge pool of unskilled workers included many women and children. In addition, waves of European immigrants provided a seemingly inexhaustible supply of low-wage laborers.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>America’s growing population became increasingly concentrated in its cities. Rapidly growing urban areas became centers for the mass consumption of food, clothing, and manufactured goods.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Government Support</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Nineteenth century federal and state governments were committed to the concept of private property and limited regulation of business activity.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>While the federal government adopted a laissez-faire policy towards business regulation, it did enact high protective tariffs to protect American industry from foreign competition.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>A group of ambitious, shrewd, and sometimes ruthless entrepreneurs took advantage of this stable and supportive business environment to build a number of enormously profitable corporations.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Golden Age of Railroads</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>America’s railroad network increased from 35,000 miles in 1865 to 193,000 miles in 1900. Railroad construction stimulated industrial growth by consuming vast quantities of iron, steel, coal, and lumber. Other industries flourished as railroads brought them raw materials and carried their finished products to distant markets.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>The railroads played a key role in creating an interconnected national transportation and communication network. As railroad and telegraph lines spread across the continent, they increased the pace of commerce by ushering in a new era of instantaneous communication.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>New Inventions</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>A series of inventions created new industries that transformed American life. The typewriter, cash register, and adding machine aided merchants by accelerating accurate business transactions. Elevators and structural steel enabled architects to design the first skyscrapers. Refrigerators and washing machines helped families by easing the burden of time-consuming chores.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426"><span id="page_153"/>b.</span>No inventor captured the public’s imagination more than Thomas Edison. His list of inventions included the first phonograph and the first commercially successful incandescent light bulb. Reflecting upon his record 1,093 patents, Edison said, “I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.”</p>
<p class="C369">6<span class="C344">.</span>Making Connections: The Business of Invention</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>In 1876, Edison opened an “invention factory” at Menlo Park, New Jersey. This facility became the prototype for the modern research laboratory.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Today most major American corporations fund special research and development departments dedicated to creating new products. For example, California’s Silicon Valley is home to Google, Facebook, Apple, and many other high-tech corporations. Silicon Valley’s list of high-tech innovations includes the silicon-based integrated circuit, the microprocessor, and the iPhone.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The factors producing America’s post–Civil War industrial expansion unleashed a new entrepreneurial spirit. A generation of ambitious and often unscrupulous entrepreneurs took advantage of America’s natural resources, growing population, and stable government to create powerful and immensely profitable corporations.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Steel and petroleum products played a particularly important role in spearheading America’s rapidly growing economy. Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller helped organize and promote these key industries.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ANDREW CARNEGIE AND STEEL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Steel is stronger, harder, and more durable than iron. But it was also much more expensive to manufacture in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result, America produced only 13,000 tons of steel in 1860.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1857, Henry Bessemer discovered that shooting a blast of cold air through hot molten iron would remove impurities. Both inexpensive and efficient, the Bessemer process enabled <span id="page_154"/>manufacturers to produce steel 20 times as durable as iron. Steel soon replaced iron to build railroads, machinery, plows, and buildings.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Andrew Carnegie became convinced that steel represented the metal of the future. Although Carnegie was not an inventor, he was a gifted organizer. Under his leadership, Carnegie Steel became a model of vertical integration in which a single company owns and controls the entire productive process from the unearthing of raw materials to the manufacture and sale of finished products. Carnegie employed this model by buying mines that produced iron ore and the ships and railroads that carried it to and from his steel plants near Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>By 1900, Carnegie Steel became the largest industrial company in the world. It employed 20,000 workers and produced more steel than Great Britain. Company profits totaled $40 million a year with $25 million going to Andrew Carnegie.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER AND OIL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In 1859, Edwin L. Drake drilled the first oil well near Titusville in northwestern Pennsylvania. Chemists soon discovered that oil could be refined into kerosene that could be used in lighting, heating, and cooking, and into petroleum that could be turned into lubricating oil, grease, and paint.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>John D. Rockefeller neither discovered oil nor invented ways to refine it. Instead, he focused on refining the oil that others produced. Recognizing the potential profits of refining oil, Rockefeller built his first refinery in Cleveland, Ohio. Situated beside Lake Erie’s key shipping lanes and near the Pennsylvania oil fields, Cleveland provided a strategic location from which Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company could dominate the refining market.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Horizontal integration is the process by which one company gains control over other firms that produce the same product. Rockefeller believed that his rivals reduced profits by flooding the market with too much refined oil. A ruthless competitor, Rockefeller used horizontal integration to take over 22 of his 26 competitors. Within a short time, Standard Oil controlled 95 percent of the oil refining in America. His control over a vital industry helped to make Rockefeller the world’s first billionaire.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Under Rockefeller’s leadership, Standard Oil evolved into a powerful trust or monopoly. Although Edison’s light bulb reduced the demand for kerosene, the automobile soon created an insatiable demand for gasoline.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Between 1869 and 1899 the value of American manufactures increased by 600 percent. America’s booming economy produced unprecedented personal fortunes. The new millionaires filled their mansions with fine furniture and precious works of art.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1900, the richest 2 percent of American households owned over one-third of the nation’s physical wealth.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SOCIAL DARWINISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Social Darwinism was a set of beliefs that explained and justified how a small group of business and industrial leaders could accumulate such great wealth. Social Darwinists applied Charles Darwin’s theory that plants and animals are engaged in a constant “struggle for existence” to society. According to Social Darwinists, individuals and corporations are also engaged in a ruthless struggle for profit in which only the fit survive and succeed.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Industrial titans such as Carnegie and Rockefeller used the “law of competition” to explain their wealth and praise the free market economic system. They believed that wealth is a reward for hard work and talent, while poverty is a punishment for laziness and bad judgment. Governments must therefore resist the temptation to regulate economic activities by supporting wage increases and social welfare programs.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Andrew Carnegie believed that disparities in wealth were inevitable in a free market system. However, he also believed that great wealth brought great responsibility.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In his 1889 “The Gospel of Wealth” essay, Carnegie warned that men who die wealthy would pass away “unwept, unhonored, and unsung.” The public would justly condemn these men because, “The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” Instead of squandering their money on passing fantasies, men of wealth have a duty to regard their surplus fortunes as a trust to be administered for the benefit of the community. Carnegie encouraged philanthropists to support public libraries, universities, museums, and other “ladders upon which the aspiring can rise.”</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_156"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>Carnegie practiced what he preached. After selling Carnegie Steel to J.P. Morgan for almost $500 million, Carnegie devoted the rest of his life to promoting the public good.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>HORATIO ALGER AND THE SELF-MADE MAN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Horatio Alger was a prolific writer who published over 100 novels that together sold more than 20 million copies. Each novel responds to America’s unequal distribution of wealth by telling a formulaic story of how an impoverished young boy became successful through hard work, honesty, and luck.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Alger’s name soon became synonymous with finding fame and fortune through “luck and pluck.” Indeed, Alger believed his novels owed their success to stories that brought to life “inspiring examples of what energy, ambition, and honest purpose may achieve.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Historians believe that Alger’s books are more than just instructive adventure stories for young readers. Written as America made the difficult transition from an agrarian society to an industrial society, Alger’s stories reassured Americans that the poor but determined “self-made man” could still achieve success in an economy increasingly dominated by huge bureaucratic corporations.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE SOCIALIST CRITIQUE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the period from 1870 to 1900, a small but vocal group of socialists rejected the responses to income inequality offered by the Social Darwinists, Andrew Carnegie, and Horatio Alger. Socialists argued that the captains of industry were actually greedy robber barons who exploited their workers. Socialists believed that the close links between big business and government enabled wealthy industrialists to drive down wages, ignore hazardous working conditions, and enjoy immense financial rewards.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although socialists agreed on the causes of the unequal distribution of wealth, they were deeply divided over tactics to achieve greater income equality. Many socialists favored the creation of trade unions to demand shorter hours, higher wages, and better working conditions. Others favored political activism by founding political parties dedicated to achieving greater government regulation of private industry.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>WAGE AND WORKING CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Owners enjoyed enormous profits while their workers earned meager salaries. For example, Marshall Field, the founder of a Chicago-based chain of department stores, earned $600.00 an hour while his shop girls survived on a salary of just $3.00 to $5.00 a week.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Factory laborers typically worked ten-hour days, six days a week. Hours were even longer in steel mills where workers put in 12-hour shifts for $1.25 a day.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>America’s poorly paid workers were also unprotected by safety regulations. American industry had the highest accident rate in the world. For example, in 1890 railroad accidents injured one railroader for every 30 employed workers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE KNIGHTS OF LABOR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Founded in 1869, the Knights of Labor attempted to unify all working men and women into a national union under the motto, “An injury to one is the concern of all.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Knights denounced “wage-slavery” and were dedicated to achieving a “cooperative commonwealth” of independent workers. The union hoped to achieve this idealistic goal by encouraging workers to combine their wages so that they could collectively purchase mines, factories, and stores.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Knights’ open-membership and a few successful strikes contributed to a period of rapid growth during the 1880s as membership rolls swelled from 42,000 in 1882 to over 700,000 in 1886.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_158"/>4<span class="C344">.</span>The Knights began to lose strength when newspapers unjustly blamed them for causing the Haymarket Square riot. As a result of this misrepresentation, the public erroneously linked the Knights with violent anarchists who opposed all forms of government. The economic depression following the Panic of 1893 ended the union’s importance.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Founded in 1886, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) was an alliance of skilled workers in craft unions. Unlike the Knights of Labor, the AFL did not welcome unskilled workers, women, or racial minorities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Led for 37 years by Samuel Gompers, the AFL opposed political activity not directly related to the union. Instead, Gompers advocated using collective bargaining and, if necessary, strikes to win concrete “bread and butter” goals such as higher wages, shorter hours, and better working conditions.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Membership in the AFL grew steadily as it replaced the Knights as America’s most powerful union. By 1904, it had 1.7 million members and Gompers was recognized as a national spokesperson for American laborers.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The AFL’s commitment to craft unionism excluded many workers. Like the Knights of Labor, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies) was intended to be “One Big Union” that would unite all skilled and unskilled workers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>While the AFL pursued “bread and butter” issues, the IWW was founded on what one of its early leaders called “the irrepressible conflict between the capitalist class and the working class.” The IWW advocated a socialist economic system in which the government would own the basic industries and natural resources.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Wobblies never attracted more than 150,000 members. Branded as dangerous radicals and agitators, they faded from the national scene by the end of World War I.</p>
<div class="C565"><p class="C564"><img alt="" src="../img/30_1.jpg"/></p></div>
<p class="C568"><strong><em><span id="page_159"/>It is important to understand the similarities and differences among the Knights of Labor, AFL, and IWW. Remember, all three were dedicated to organizing laborers. The Knights and the IWW both attempted to organize all skilled and unskilled workers into one union. However, the Knights strove for a cooperative society, while the IWW embraced class conflict. In contrast, the AFL organized skilled workers, repudiated violence, and fought for higher wages and better working conditions</em>.</strong></p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE GREAT RAILROAD STRIKE OF 1877</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Panic of 1873 triggered a severe depression that bankrupted 47,000 firms and drove wholesale prices down by 30 percent. As orders for industrial goods fell, railroad lines in the East began a series of pay cuts. On July 16, 1877, railroad workers spontaneously walked off their jobs to protest a second wage cut by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. Walkouts and sympathy demonstrations quickly followed as the strike spread from Maryland to California.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 was the first major interstate strike in American history. As the strike rippled across the country it paralyzed rail service. Looters and rioters destroyed millions of dollars of property. State militia and federal troops called out by President Hayes finally crushed the strike and restored order.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 signaled the beginning of a period of strikes and violent confrontations between labor and management. Between 1880 and 1900 over 23,000 strikes, the most in the industrial world, disrupted the American economy.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE HOMESTEAD STRIKE, 1892</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers was the largest craft union in the AFL. The union’s history of friendly relations with Andrew Carnegie’s company abruptly changed in 1892 when Henry Clay Frick became president of the Homestead plant outside of Pittsburgh. Frick was determined to replace expensive skilled workers with new labor-saving machinery. He reduced the number of workers and slashed salaries by nearly 20 percent in a deliberate attempt to break the union.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>When the Amalgamated called for a strike, Frick closed the Homestead plant and hired 300 union-busting Pinkerton detectives <span id="page_160"/>to protect the nonunion workers. Enraged strikers fired at barges carrying Pinkertons to the plant. Three detectives and ten workers died before the Pinkertons finally surrendered.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The workers’ victory proved to be short-lived. The governor of Pennsylvania ordered the state’s entire contingent of 8,000 National Guard troops to Homestead to protect the plant. The strike finally ended four months later, leaving the union broken and defeated.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE PULLMAN STRIKE, 1894</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Pullman Strike began as a dispute between the Pullman Palace Car Company and its 3,000 employees. Following the Panic of 1893, the Pullman company cut the wages of its workers by about 25 percent. However, the company did not reduce the rent or prices it charged workers in company-run stores at the “model” town of Pullman just outside of Chicago.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As tensions mounted and negotiations failed, many workers joined the American Railway Union led by Eugene Debs. Fearing that they had no alternative, desperate Pullman workers walked off their jobs. The American Railway Union then staged a nationwide boycott of Pullman cars. Since most railroad companies used Pullman cars, rail traffic ground to a halt in Chicago and across 27 states and territories.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>President Cleveland called out federal troops to break the strike on the grounds that it obstructed delivery of the U.S. mail. The Pullman Strike once again demonstrated that the federal government would actively intervene to crush strikes and protect management.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The outcome of the Pullman Strike left Debs disillusioned and embittered. Within a few years, he became a key leader of the Socialist Party of America.</p>
