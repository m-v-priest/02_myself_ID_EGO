<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>“THE TORCH HAS PASSED TO A NEW GENERATION”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>John F. Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by a razor-thin popular margin of 116,000 votes. “The margin is narrow,” Kennedy admitted, “but the responsibility is clear.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On January 20, 1961, Dwight Eisenhower, then the oldest man ever to serve as President, watched as his successor, John F. Kennedy, took the oath of office as the youngest man to hold the nation’s highest office. As a brilliant winter sun sparkled on a layer of newly fallen snow, the 43-year-old president proudly announced, “The torch has passed to a new generation of Americans.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW FRONTIER</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>JFK inspired America with his pledge to boldly lead the country into a “New Frontier.” Hoping to become an activist President in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, Kennedy’s New Frontier included plans to fight poverty, support civil rights for African Americans, aid education, and provide health insurance for the elderly.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Once in office, Kennedy began enacting a number of innovative programs. For example, the Peace Corps sent thousands of idealistic volunteers to battle hunger, disease, and illiteracy in developing nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The Alliance for Progress proposed to use America’s economic strength to fight poverty in Latin America. And in the space race with the Soviets, Kennedy committed the United States to put the first man on the moon.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>BERLIN</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the presidential campaign, Kennedy predicted that communist expansion posed the most important threat to the Free <span id="page_256"/>World. “To be an American in the next decade,” he warned, “will be a hazardous experience. We will live on the edge of danger.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Kennedy’s first Cold War confrontation came in Berlin. At a summit meeting in Vienna in June 1961, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev threatened to isolate West Berlin by placing it under the control of East Germany. When Kennedy refused to surrender Western occupation rights, Khrushchev angrily declared, “If you want war, that is your problem.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Aware of America’s formidable nuclear arsenal, Khrushchev did not want to provoke a war. But he did want to stop the stream of 3 million refugees who fled from East Germany to West Berlin. On August 13, 1961, Khrushchev ordered East German troops to begin constructing a concrete wall topped with barbed wire along the border between East and West Berlin. Known as the Berlin Wall, the barrier cut the flow of refugees, thus ending the Berlin crisis. However, the superpower stalemate continued as Berlin, like all of Europe, remained divided.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE BAY OF PIGS INVASION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the late 1950s, Fidel Castro led a popular revolution that overthrew Cuba’s corrupt dictator Fulgencio Batista. Although he promised to turn Cuba into a democratic nation, Castro seized American-owned businesses, nationalized the country’s major industries, and established close ties with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>When he became president, Kennedy learned that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was preparing an army of 1,400 Cuban exiles to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs on the island’s southern coast. The CIA confidently predicted the invaders would spark a popular uprising that would overthrow Castro. Despite serious doubts, Kennedy allowed the invasion to take place on April 17, 1961.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The dream of overthrowing Castro quickly turned into a nightmare when a powerful Cuban army overwhelmed the exile force. The fiasco handed JFK an embarrassing defeat damaging his credibility and inviting further provocations from Castro and Khrushchev.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Tempted by Kennedy’s inexperience and apparent lack of resolve, an emboldened Khrushchev secretly allowed Russian technicians to build 42 ballistic missile sites in Cuba. The missiles could be fitted with nuclear warheads 20 to 30 times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_257"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>A high-flying U-2 spy plane discovered the missile sites on October 14, 1962. Kennedy and his advisors recognized that these weapons posed a serious threat to America’s national security and the global balance of power. After days of secret deliberations, Kennedy publicly announced a “quarantine” or naval blockade of Cuba and demanded the removal of the missiles already in place. If the Soviet Union refused, the United States would launch a massive invasion force to destroy the missiles.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The world now faced the terrifying possibility of a nuclear war. Confronted with America’s firm determination and overwhelming military superiority, Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles in return for an American pledge not to invade Cuba.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Cuban Missile Crisis enhanced Kennedy’s popularity and global prestige. In contrast, it weakened Khrushchev and played a key role in his fall from power two years later.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Having approached the brink of nuclear catastrophe, Kennedy and Khrushchev worked to improve relations and prevent a recurrence of such a dangerous confrontation. They agreed to install a “hotline” allowing direct communication between Washington and Moscow in a crisis.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The successful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis gave Kennedy a new confidence. In an important speech delivered on June 10, 1963, JFK shifted from confrontational Cold War rhetoric by reminding his listeners, “We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s futures.” Three months later the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the 1960 presidential campaign Kennedy pledged to actively work for African American civil rights. However, as president he failed to launch an attack on segregation in the South.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>While JFK wavered, black activists turned to direct action to confront Jim Crow segregation. For example, mob violence did not deter the Freedom Riders from winning an order from the Interstate Commerce Commission banning segregation in <span id="page_258"/>interstate bus terminals. Across the country, more and more blacks marched against segregation as they sang the civil rights anthem, “We shall overcome.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>BIRMINGHAM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In April 1963, the focus of the civil rights struggle shifted to Birmingham, Alabama. At that time, Birmingham was the largest segregated city in the United States. Eugene “Bull” Connor, the city’s Commissioner of Public Safety, promptly arrested over 3,000 demonstrators, including Dr. King.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>While in jail, Dr. King wrote his famous “Letter from Birmingham City Jail” in which he defended civil disobedience as a justified response to unjust segregation laws. Dr. King called upon white clergymen to join him in being “extremists for the cause of justice.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Bull Connor did not read Dr. King’s letter. On May 3, his men used clubs, snarling police attack dogs, and high-pressure fire hoses to disperse a peaceful demonstration. Connor’s strategy backfired when outraged Americans watched news broadcasts of what one journalist called “a visual demonstration of sin, vivid enough to rouse the conscience of the entire nation.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>PRESIDENT KENNEDY SPEAKS OUT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The events in Birmingham forced President Kennedy to act. In a televised address on June 11, 1963, he forcefully argued for racial justice: “We are confronted primarily with a moral issue . . . The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Kennedy’s speech marked a major turning point in the civil rights movement. Eight days later, the president called upon Congress to pass a sweeping civil rights bill that would prohibit segregation in public places, speed up school integration, and ban discrimination in hiring practices.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Dr. King recognized the importance of building a nationwide alliance of what he called a “coalition of conscience” to support President Kennedy’s civil rights bill. Dr. King and other black leaders called for a massive March on Washington to demonstrate public support for the bill.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_259"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The climax of the day came when Dr. King addressed a crowd of over 200,000 black and white civil rights supporters. His famous “I Have a Dream” speech left an indelible memory on everyone who heard it. Inspired by Dr. King, the unified crowd sang “We shall overcome” and repeatedly chanted “Pass the bill!”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: DR. KING AND MALCOLM X</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Dr. King advocated non-violent protests to challenge Jim Crow segregation. He worked to create a racially integrated society in which people “will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” Dr. King opposed violence arguing, “It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the early 1960s, Malcolm X emerged as a leading voice of an increasingly militant wing of the civil rights movement. He embraced black nationalism as an alternative to Dr. King’s vision of a racially integrated society achieved by peaceful means. Malcolm X exhorted blacks to cast off the shackles of racism “by any means necessary” including violence: “When I say fight for independence right here, I don’t mean any nonviolent fight, or turn-the-other-cheek fight. Those days are gone, those days are over.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>DALLAS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In the fall of 1963, President Kennedy appeared to be fulfilling his promise as a leader. He met the Soviet challenge in Cuba, took the first steps toward reducing Cold War tensions, and launched a moral and legislative attack on segregation. About 60 percent of the public approved his performance.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>No one foresaw that a terrible national tragedy lay just ahead. On November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. The tragic news flashed instantly across the nation and then around the world. Television became what one reporter called “the window on the world.” Shocked viewers watched a somber Vice President Lyndon Johnson take the oath of office while a grief-stricken Jacqueline Kennedy stood by his side.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: THE KENNEDY LEGACY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Kennedy achieved a mixed record of successes and failures. Cold War historians condemn his rash decision to approve the Bay of Pigs invasion while praising his adept handling of the <span id="page_260"/>Cuban Missile Crisis. Social historians fault Kennedy for initially moving slowly on civil rights, but laud his strong moral leadership toward the end of his presidency. Overall, presidential scholars rank JFK as a good, but not great, president.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Unlike professional historians, the American public consistently awards Kennedy the highest approval rating of any president since Franklin Roosevelt. JFK’s youth and vitality embodied the aspirations of a new generation. Historian Alan Brinkley concludes, “He remains a powerful symbol of a lost moment, of a soaring idealism and hopefulness that subsequent generations still try to recover.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>“LET US CONTINUE”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Lyndon Johnson took office under tragic and demanding circumstances. No previous vice president had ever witnessed the assassination of a president.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson reminded a joint session of Congress that when listing his goals President Kennedy had said, “Let us begin.” The new president solemnly declared, “Let us continue.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>LANDMARK CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson understood that civil rights remained America’s most urgent social problem. Demonstrating his legendary ability to persuade Senators to support his bills, LBJ overcame strong Southern opposition and won passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The landmark act gave all citizens the right to use public facilities such as hotels, restaurants, and theatres. The law authorized the attorney general to bring suits to speed school desegregation. In addition, it created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to prevent job discrimination. Finally, Title VII barred discrimination based on sex. Women’s groups successfully used this provision to secure government support for greater equality in education and employment.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>President Johnson and civil rights leaders now turned to the issue of voting rights. A combination of literacy tests and poll taxes effectively nullified the Fifteenth and Nineteenth amendments giving black men and women the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 abolished literacy tests and other tactics used to <span id="page_261"/>prevent blacks from voting. At the same time, the Twenty-fourth Amendment outlawed the poll tax in federal elections. Together the Voting Rights Act and the Twenty-fourth Amendment enabled millions of African American citizens to vote for the first time.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR ON POVERTY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Johnson believed his landslide victory over Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election gave him a mandate to pursue his dream of creating a Great Society that would use America’s great prosperity to help improve the quality of life for everyone.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Despite America’s great wealth, about one-fifth of the nation’s families earned less than $3,000 a year. Shocked by this jarring fact, LBJ declared an “unconditional War on Poverty.”</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Congress passed a host of new federal programs to help the poor. For example, high school dropouts learned new skills in over 50 Job Corps camps, while half-a-million pre-school children attended special Head Start programs to help them prepare for school. Although many criticized the War on Poverty for waste, it gave hope to millions and helped reduce the number of poor by nearly 10 million people from 1964 to 1967.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: CHANGING PATTERNS OF IMMIGRATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Immigration Act of 1965 abolished the system of national quotas instituted during the 1920s. The act established a ceiling of 120,000 on immigrants from the Western Hemisphere and 170,000 from the rest of the world. The law established preferences for close relatives as well as for those with needed occupational skills.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Immigration Act of 1965 has had a profound impact on America’s demographic character. The family unification preference led to the phenomenon of chain immigration in which the naturalization of a single immigrant from Asia, Africa, or Hispanic background opened the door to his or her brothers and sisters and their spouses.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>These provisions have triggered a major new wave of immigration. Between 1990 and 2010 about 20 million immigrants entered the United States. The largest number of these immigrants came from Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_262"/>E.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: THE NEW DEAL AND THE GREAT SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Both the New Deal and the Great Society used the power of the federal government to promote social justice, fight poverty, and solve social problems. As a result, both programs led to an increase in federal spending for social services. And finally, both the New Deal and the Great Society supported the arts, encouraged housing construction, helped the elderly, and instituted government-sponsored employment programs.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The New Deal responded to an economic depression while the Great Society was enacted during a period of economic prosperity. Unlike the New Deal, the Great Society included landmark legislation protecting the civil liberties and voting rights of African Americans. While both programs fought poverty, the Great Society included a program providing preschool education for disadvantaged children.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When Kennedy took the oath of office, about 900 American military advisers aided the South Vietnamese army. This minimal military presence failed to deter Viet Cong attacks designed to destabilize the South Vietnam government.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Distracted by Cold War crises in Berlin and Cuba, Kennedy hoped an additional 15,000 military advisors would buttress the South Vietnamese government. He planned to conduct a thorough review of America’s commitment to South Vietnam when he returned from Dallas.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE GULF OF TONKIN RESOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Johnson inherited an increasingly dangerous situation in South Vietnam. On August 4, 1964, he received unsubstantiated reports that North Vietnamese gunboats had fired on two American destroyers patrolling in the Gulf of Tonkin. The next day, Johnson asked Congress to pass a resolution authorizing him to take “all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.” The House of Representatives unanimously supported the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution while just two Senators opposed it.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_263"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson’s handling of the Gulf of Tonkin affair seemed to be a major political success. Opinion polls showed that 72 percent of the American public supported his handling of the war in Vietnam. Very few people listened when Senator Wayne Morris, who voted against the resolution, warned: “We are in effect giving the President war-making powers in the absence of a declaration of war. I believe that to be a historic mistake.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ESCALATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>While LBJ focused on his Great Society legislation, the situation in South Vietnam continued to deteriorate. By the beginning of 1965, the Viet Cong controlled almost three-fourths of South Vietnam’s land and over half its population. American observers all agreed that the nation would collapse within a short time.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>LBJ vowed, “I am not going to be the President who saw Southeast Asia go the way China went.” He therefore rejected the options of withdrawing the U.S. advisors or negotiating a peace settlement. Instead, in March 1965 he took the fateful step of choosing to dramatically escalate America’s military commitment by sending combat troops to Vietnam.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>When it became clear that North Vietnam could not be quickly defeated, Johnson poured more men and money into the war effort. By the end of 1967, about 500,000 American soldiers guarded South Vietnam’s cities and patrolled its rice paddies. Search-and-destroy missions killed over 200,000 enemy soldiers, but left one-fourth of the people in South Vietnam homeless. The Viet Cong struck back with deadly ambushes and hidden booby-traps. About 16,000 American soldiers lost their lives between 1965 and 1967.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>HAWKS VERSUS DOVES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>When President Johnson escalated the war about two-thirds of the public approved his decision. Known as “hawks,” they argued that America was fighting a just cause to defend freedom in South Vietnam. Without American help, South Vietnam would collapse and communist oppression would spread across all of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>When the war did not end quickly, a growing number of people began to question the rationale for the Vietnam War. Known as “doves,” critics argued the U.S. could not win a guerilla war in Asia. The tragic loss of life was too great. Instead of saving South Vietnam, American bombers were destroying it. The dollars spent <span id="page_264"/>in Vietnam would be better spent funding Great Society programs to rebuild American cities and help the poor.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The increasingly bitter debate between the hawks and the doves divided America. A deeply ambivalent housewife expressed the public’s mood of frustration when she told an interviewer, “I want to get out, but I don’t want to give up.”</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW LEFT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The civil rights movement inspired activist students at elite Big Ten and Ivy League universities. In 1962, members of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) held a national convention at Port Huron, Michigan. Tom Hayden wrote the “Port Huron Statement” expressing the group’s disillusionment with materialistic values and Cold War policies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The founders of the SDS referred to their movement as the New Left to distinguish themselves from “Old Left” communists and socialists during the 1930s. The New Left claimed liberals were doing too little to address racial and economic inequality.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ANTIWAR PROTESTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Although most college students did not share the New Left’s radical political views, they did participate in the national debate between the hawks and the doves.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As the Vietnam War escalated, college professors organized teach-ins to discuss American policy in Vietnam. The teach-ins convinced many students that the Vietnam War was immoral. Soon thousands of students began to organize antiwar demonstrations across America.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_265"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE HIPPIES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The students’ most significant impact occurred outside their university campuses and antiwar protests. A number of young people called hippies believed love, not war, provided the real solution to America’s problems. Hippies argued that this could only be accomplished by creating a new alternative lifestyle or counterculture.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Raised in the most prosperous society the world had ever known, hippies nonetheless rejected the values of hard work, neat appearance, and economic success taught by their parents. Instead, the new counterculture emphasized the importance of being “groovy” by “doing your own thing.” Being groovy meant wearing long hair, jeans, sandals, and love beads instead of business suits and dresses.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Hippies believed they were leading America into a new age of harmony and understanding. A “summer of love” in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district in 1967 attracted thousands of “flower children” to a “love-in” featuring sexual freedom, drugs, and communal living.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Arlo Guthrie, a popular hippie singer, confidently predicted, “Peace is on the way. People are simply gonna learn that they can get more by being groovy than by being greedy.” In fact, the struggle between flower power in San Francisco and firepower in Vietnam had only just begun.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE IMPACT OF THE COUNTERCULTURE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The counterculture challenged traditional values boasting that it represented a new generation with a new explanation. In many ways the counterculture became the culture as the hippies’ rejection of traditional values and lack of trust of authority figures became important strands in the national mind. In addition, the counterculture’s commitment to liberation inspired both the women’s movement and the gay rights movement.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The counterculture stunned and repelled Americans who embraced the nation’s traditional values. Soon to be called “the great silent majority,” these Americans became part of a cultural and political backlash that rejuvenated the conservative movement and ultimately played a key role in the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE LONG HOT SUMMERS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>While the hippies preached love and peace, inner cities across America burst into flames. During the long hot summers from 1965 to 1967, civil unrest scarred cities and towns across America. The riots in 1967 claimed 43 lives in Detroit and 26 in Newark, New Jersey while leaving 1,800 injured people in 23 other cities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The riots focused attention on African Americans living in inner city ghettoes in the North and on the West Coast. The civil rights movement and the War on Poverty raised hopes that could not be quickly fulfilled. The Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts addressed Jim Crow discrimination in the South, but failed to improve the daily lives of unemployed inner-city residents in the North who lived in deteriorating housing while their children attended failing schools.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE KERNER COMMISSION REPORT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The mounting civil unrest alarmed the nation and prompted President Johnson to appoint a special commission to investigate the causes of the 1967 riots and provide recommendations for future actions. Led by Governor Otto Kerner of Illinois, the 11-member commission released its report on February 29, 1968.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Kerner Commission concluded that the migration of middle-class families to suburbs left impoverished inner city neighborhoods. The commission bluntly warned that, “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.” It called for massive government spending programs to fight poverty by building new housing, improving schools, and training unemployed workers for new jobs.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Kerner Commission failed to achieve its objectives. Unwilling to shift scarce resources from the Vietnam War to social reform, President Johnson chose to ignore the report. At the same time, conservatives called for a renewed emphasis upon restoring law and order.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_267"/>C.</strong></span><strong>STOKELY CARMICHAEL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The riots shook the civil rights movement’s confidence in peaceful reform. Following the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, Stokely Carmichael became the best-known militant black leader. Carmichael expressed growing impatience with Dr. King’s nonviolent marches when he boldly called for “black power.” Carmichael’s transition from a leader of SNCC to the black power movement represents an important change over time as part of the civil rights movement and highlights the historical complexity of the era.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As expressed by Carmichael, black power meant that African Americans should control their own communities by developing black-owned businesses and electing black public officials. Carmichael’s call for black power captured the imagination of inner city black youths while alarming the general public.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE TET OFFENSIVE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On January 31, 1968, the first day of the Vietnamese New Year (Tet), Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces attacked over one hundred cities, villages, and military bases across Vietnam. Although U.S. and South Vietnamese forces regained the initiative and won a military victory, the heavy fighting undermined President Johnson’s confident prediction that “victory was just around the corner.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As LBJ’s credibility and popularity sank, senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy launched campaigns to challenge him for the Democratic presidential nomination. Their campaigns inspired antiwar activists and placed enormous pressure on the beleaguered president.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>JOHNSON’S SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>President Johnson felt increasingly bitter and isolated. On March 31, 1968, he announced a series of shocking decisions. He rejected General Westmoreland’s request for 206,000 more troops and instead ordered a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam. He also called upon the leaders of North Vietnam to begin peace talks.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Johnson then paused and told the nation his final decision: “I have decided that I shall not seek, and will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your President.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_268"/>C.</strong></span><strong>TWO ASSASSINATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Four days after President Johnson’s speech, a man later identified as James Earl Ray shot and killed Dr. King as the civil rights leader stood on a balcony near his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee. Ray’s motives for the crime remain unknown.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The news of Dr. King’s death touched off a wave of violent riots. Many African Americans, Hispanics, and working-class Americans looked to Robert Kennedy for leadership. Backed by these groups, Kennedy defeated McCarthy in the crucial California primary.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>On June 5, 1968, an already shaken nation watched in stunned disbelief as Kennedy was shot and killed after he thanked his triumphant supporters for their help. The assassin was an Arab nationalist named Sirhan Sirhan who opposed Kennedy’s support for Israel.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE DIVIDED DEMOCRATS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The deeply divided Democratic Party met in Chicago where they nominated Vice President Hubert Humphrey for President. However, violent antiwar demonstrations marred Humphrey’s nomination. The spectacle of police firing tear gas at demonstrators badly tarnished the Humphrey campaign.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Democrats faced another divisive challenge when Alabama Governor George C. Wallace ran as a third-party candidate. Wallace threatened to take away many traditional Democratic votes by appealing to working-class Americans who were upset by the urban riots and antiwar demonstrations.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>AND THEN THERE WAS NIXON</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>While the shocking events of 1968 dominated the news, Richard Nixon staged a remarkable political comeback. Nixon believed that most Americans were tired of hippies, antiwar demonstrators, and urban rioters. He carefully avoided controversy while promising he had a plan to find an honorable end to the Vietnam War.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Nixon easily won the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. On Election Day, Nixon won a solid majority of the electoral votes while winning a narrow margin of the popular votes. Richard Nixon now assumed the burden of ending the Vietnam War and reuniting a badly divided country.</p>
