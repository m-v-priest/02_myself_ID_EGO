<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>George Washington commanded unmatched prestige and respect. The Electoral College unanimously elected Washington president in 1789 and again in 1792.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Washington named Alexander Hamilton to head the Department of Treasury and Thomas Jefferson to head the Department of State. Widely recognized for their brilliance, both men had served America with distinction during the Revolutionary War and the struggle to create a new national government.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Hamilton submitted a series of far-reaching economic reports to Congress. These reports exposed deep divisions within American society, raised significant constitutional issues, and turned political allies into partisan adversaries.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>HAMILTON’S PROPOSALS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>To restore confidence in America’s credit by funding the federal debt at face value and by assuming state debts incurred during the Revolution.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>To adopt an excise tax on liquor to aid in raising revenue to fund the national debt.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>To impose tariffs on imported goods to raise revenue and to protect America’s new industries.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>To charter a national bank that would provide a stable currency and a source of capital for loans to fund the development of business and commerce.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE ISSUE: IS A NATIONAL BANK CONSTITUTIONAL?</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Congress passed the bank bill over Madison’s objections. Before signing the bill into law, Washington asked Jefferson and Hamilton <span id="page_60"/>to compose written opinions on the constitutionality of creating a national bank.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Washington’s request sparked America’s first debate on whether the Constitution should be interpreted strictly or loosely.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>JEFFERSON’S ARGUMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jefferson admitted that a bank would be a convenient aid to Congress in regulating the currency and collecting taxes.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>However, Jefferson forcefully argued that a national bank was not absolutely necessary. The Constitution does not specifically authorize Congress to create a national bank. Jefferson favored a “strict” interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that what the Constitution does not permit, it forbids.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>HAMILTON’S ARGUMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Hamilton countered by pointing out that the Constitution specifically empowers Congress to collect taxes and regulate trade. A national bank would be more than a convenience; it would be a necessary institution for carrying out these powers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Hamilton argued that the Necessary and Proper Clause gave Congress the implied power to charter a national bank. He favored a “loose” interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that what the Constitution does not forbid, it permits.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>WASHINGTON’S FATEFUL DECISION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Hamilton’s arguments prevailed and Washington signed the bank bill into law, thus chartering the First National Bank of the United States.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Hamilton’s “loose construction” theory of the Constitution set an important precedent for the expansion of federal power. Jefferson and his supporters warned that the bank would create a “boundless field of power” for financial interests. The dispute between Jefferson and Hamilton created loose coalitions of leaders with opposing views and interests. The controversy over foreign policy hardened these coalitions into America’s first political parties.</p>

</tr>
</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>A number of issues strained relations between the United States and Great Britain. The British impeded western settlement by refusing to evacuate forts in the Northwest Territory. Angry Americans accused the British of deliberately supporting Indian attacks on frontier settlements. In addition, British naval commanders seized some 250 American merchant ships trading with the French West Indies.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Determined to avoid war, Washington sent Chief Justice John Jay to London with orders to negotiate a treaty resolving the issues dividing the two countries.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Jay brought back a treaty in which Britain promised to evacuate the Northwest forts and pay damages for seized American ships. In return Jay agreed that the United States would pay the debts owed to British merchants on pre-Revolutionary accounts. Despite these agreements, the British stubbornly refused to renounce their right to make future seizures of ships and to repay Southern planters for slaves taken during the Revolution.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Jay’s Treaty kept the peace with Great Britain, but strained relations with France.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Treaty had particularly important domestic consequences. Opponents unleashed what Jefferson called “a burst of dissatisfaction.” They bitterly complained that the treaty turned its back on America’s friendship with France. Southern planters vehemently protested that the treaty forced them to pay the lion’s share of pre-Revolutionary debts while New England merchants collected damages for seized ships.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>After some hesitation, Washington endorsed the treaty and it received the necessary Senate two-thirds approval with no votes to spare. The ratification fight played a key role in exacerbating the increasingly bitter disputes between Hamilton’s Federalist supporters and Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican supporters.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Political parties are not mentioned in the Constitution. Led by James Madison, the Framers opposed political parties as sources of corruption and vehicles for self-interest and personal ambition.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>During the Washington administration, political parties began to coalesce around the economic policies and political philosophies of Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. The Federalist Party supported Hamilton’s programs while opponents led by Jefferson founded the Democratic-Republican Party.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The emergence of the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans inaugurated America’s two-party system. Historians divide American political history into party eras. The first party era began with the election of John Adams in 1796.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE FEDERALISTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Alexander Hamilton and John Adams, the Federalists drew support from the New England and eastern port cities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Federalists favored a strong central government and a loose interpretation of the Constitution. They supported the national bank, protective tariffs, commercial interests, and the British over the French.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICANS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the Democratic-Republicans drew support from the South and frontier farmers.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Democratic-Republicans favored a weak central government and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. They opposed the National Bank and protective tariffs while favoring agrarian interests and the French over the British.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE WARNING</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In his Farewell Address to the nation in 1796, Washington responded to calls to support the revolutionary government of France by urging future American leaders to avoid forming permanent alliances with foreign nations.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_63"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>“The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations,” Washington advised, “is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: ISOLATIONISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Washington’s Farewell Address had a significant impact upon America’s foreign policy. For example, following World War I, Republican congressmen used Washington’s views to justify their refusal to support the League of Nations. During the 1930s, many congressional leaders used the Farewell Address to justify their support for Neutrality Acts intended to prevent America from becoming entangled in European conflicts.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Second World War ended the influence of Washington’s Farewell Address upon American foreign policy. Following the war, the United States adopted a foreign policy designed to contain Soviet expansion. As the leader of the Free World, the United States joined the United Nations and became a founding member of the NATO alliance.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE QUASI-WAR WITH FRANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Foreign policy dominated the Adams presidency. He inherited an undeclared Quasi-War with France.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The French resented Jay’s Treaty arguing that it favored British interests. They retaliated by announcing that they would no longer honor the neutrality of American ships. In 1797, French corsairs operating in the West Indies seized over 300 American ships.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>President Adams resisted enormous pressure to declare war on France. He defied Hamilton and other war hawks by sending envoys to France. Now led by Napoleon Bonaparte, the French preferred to avoid war with the United States and concentrate on their conflict with Great Britain.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ALIEN AND SEDITION ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Federalists took advantage of the anti-French furor to pass a series of laws known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. The acts were intended to punish the Democratic-Republicans.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_64"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>The Naturalization Act raised the residency requirement for U.S. citizenship from 5 to 14 years. Outraged Democratic-Republicans insisted that the act’s real purpose was to prevent immigrants from voting for their party.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Alien Acts authorized the President to deport dangerous aliens.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Sedition Act made it illegal to speak, write, or print any statements about the President that would bring him “into contempt or disrepute.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE KENTUCKY AND VIRGINIA RESOLUTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Federalists controlled all three branches of the federal government. Both Jefferson and Madison believed that the Alien and Sedition Acts embodied a threat to individual liberties caused by unchecked Federalist power.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Jefferson and Madison anonymously authored a series of resolutions that were approved by the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures. They denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts as “alarming infractions” of the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions advanced a states’ rights doctrine asserting that the Constitution arose as a compact among sovereign states. The states therefore retained the power to challenge and, if necessary, nullify federal laws.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: NULLIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The other states did not support the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions. Nonetheless, Jefferson and Madison successfully turned public opinion against the Federalists by accusing them of taking steps on the road to tyranny. Jefferson defeated Adams in the 1800 presidential election in part because of his position as a defender of Revolutionary principles.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The immediate dispute over the Alien and Sedition Acts faded when the laws expired in 1801. However, their states’ rights argument had a deep and lasting impact. During the 1830s, John C. Calhoun promoted the theory of nullification, the idea that a state had the right to veto a federal law it considered unconstitutional. Criticized as “a recipe for disunion,” the doctrine of states’ rights played an important role in causing the Civil War.</p>
