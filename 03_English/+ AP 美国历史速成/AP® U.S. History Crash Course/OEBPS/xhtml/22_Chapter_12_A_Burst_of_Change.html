<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As ambitious planters and their slaves poured into the Deep South (<a href="21_Chapter_11_The_Old_South.html#page_83">Chapter 11</a>), a second wave of settlers pushed into the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes region.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1800, just 387,000 settlers lived in the trans-Allegheny region. Twenty years later the number swelled to 2.4 million.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Fertile but thickly matted soil awaited farmers arriving in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. They quickly discovered that iron plows that had worked well on East Coast farms proved unable to reliably clear the tough sticky Midwestern soil. John Deere’s new polished steel-tipped plow solved the problem. Sharp and durable enough to slice through the soil, Deere’s new plow enabled farmers to efficiently till their fields. Deere proved to be a talented publicist as his new company soon sold over 10,000 steel plows a year.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Midwestern farmers found that their land supported abundant wheat crops. However, they initially used hand-operated sickles that limited even the most industrious farmer to harvesting just a half-acre of wheat a day. In 1831, Cyrus McCormick invented a mechanical horse-drawn reaper that could harvest twelve acres of wheat a day.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Like the cotton gin, the mechanical reaper revolutionized American agriculture. As golden fields of wheat spread across the Northwest, farmers could harvest and sell their crop to East Coast consumers. But first they had to get their produce to these distant markets.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ROADS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The federal government began to finance construction of the National Road in 1811. When finally completed in 1837, the 620-mile road stretched from western Maryland to Vandalia in Illinois.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although the National Road represented a vast improvement over wilderness trails, land travel was still difficult, slow, and expensive. Covered wagons proved to be an inefficient and expensive way to transport wheat, corn, and other bulky Midwestern products across the mountains separating them from lucrative East Coast markets.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: THE IMPACT OF THE ERIE CANAL</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Because of the difficulties of land transportation, Midwestern farmers used a circuitous route that took their produce down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans where it was then loaded onto ships headed for East Coast port cities.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>DeWitt Clinton, the governor of New York, had an audacious plan that reshaped American commerce. In 1817, crews began the construction of a canal connecting Albany on the Hudson River with Buffalo on Lake Erie. When it opened in 1825, the 363-mile-long Erie Canal created an all-water route that cut travel time from New York City to Buffalo from 20 days to just 6. Mule-drawn barges cut the cost of moving a ton of freight between these two cities from $100.00 to $5.00.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Erie Canal enabled farmers in upstate New York and in Ohio to send their wheat to New York harbor. At the same time, these once isolated farmers could now import clocks, mattresses, curtains, and even Long Island oysters at a fraction of their former cost. During the 1830s, the Erie Canal carried more freight than the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Erie Canal transformed New York City into America’s foremost commercial center. At the same time it tightened economic bonds between the North and the Old Northwest. The success of the Erie Canal inspired a decade-long mania for building canals that witnessed the construction of about 3,000 miles of new waterways.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>STEAMBOATS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The westward flowing Ohio River provided a convenient all-water route to the Mississippi and New Orleans. While reaching New Orleans was relatively straightforward, returning home was not. A farmer could travel north on horseback over the dangerous <span id="page_91"/>Natchez Trail. Most prudent people chose instead to ride back up the Mississippi on safe but slow-moving keelboats.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1807, Robert Fulton revolutionized water travel by proving that steam could propel a ship. His steamship <em>Clermont</em> successfully puffed its way up the Hudson River from New York City to Albany. Steamboats quickly became a common sight in East Coast harbors.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Steamboats also revolutionized trade on the Mississippi River. In 1811, the steamboat <em>New Orleans</em> powered its way up the Mississippi to Natchez. Soon steamboats capable of traveling ten miles an hour brought two-way traffic to the Mississippi. By the 1840s, more than 1,000 steamboats were carrying freight and people on the Mississippi and its tributaries. New Orleans and St. Louis became great Mississippi ports while Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Louisville became major cities along the Ohio River.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>RAILROADS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The use of steam power also revolutionized land travel. During the 1820s, British engineers successfully built a railroad line connecting the port of Liverpool with the industrial city of Manchester.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Liverpool-Manchester Railway inspired business leaders in Baltimore to finance a pioneering railroad line. By 1832, the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) Railroad extended 72 miles west of Baltimore.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The B&amp;O demonstrated that railroads were a cheaper and faster means of moving passengers and freight than canals. As “railroad fever” swept across the country, new lines connected major cities especially across the North.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The transformative impact of the railroad can be seen in the presidency of Andrew Jackson. Like other presidents before him, Jackson traveled to his inauguration in 1829 in a horse-drawn carriage. Eight years later he left Washington on a train.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Throughout history messages had been limited by how fast messengers could travel. For example, it took riders on horseback a week to deliver the news of Washington’s death in Arlington, Virginia, to New York City.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Canals, steamboats, and railroads all shortened travel times enabling news to travel more quickly. For example, the Erie Canal <span id="page_92"/>reduced travel times from New York City to Ohio from 2 to 3 weeks to just one week.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE TELEGRAPH</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Benjamin Franklin’s pioneering work, electricity had long fascinated scientists and inventors. During the 1840s, several inventors made telegraph systems using wires that carried low-voltage currents. In 1844, Samuel F. B. Morse tapped out the first telegraph message in history over a line connecting Washington, D.C., to Baltimore.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The telegraph allowed instant communications over vast distances. Soon telegraph poles ran alongside the new railroad tracks. The railroads carried passengers and freight; the telegraph carried news. Both worked at previously unprecedented speeds, linking the nation as never before.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The telegraph initially had little direct impact on most people’s daily lives. Owned by companies such as Western Union and operated by trained specialists, the telegraph enabled railroads to create efficient schedules for their trains. The telegraph also enabled businesses to obtain news about the price of goods in distant markets.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Each new communications technology has had a greater impact on society than the one before it. The telephone, radio, and television all created an instantaneous flow of voices and images around the world. Today, the digital revolution is creating a fast-paced global market that is reshaping the pace and quality of daily life around the world.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>During the Era of Good Feelings, most Americans bought or bartered goods from friends and neighbors in a local economy.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The new network of roads, canals, steamship lines, and rail lines enabled merchants, farmers, and planters to reach consumers in other markets of the country. The term “market revolution” in antebellum America refers to the creation of a national economy that linked regions and people who were previously unable to access such a large market.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE BEGINNING OF THE FACTORY SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The cotton gin, reaper, and growing use of steamships and railroads created an agricultural revolution in the South and Midwest. At the same time, new technologies spurred the rise of the factory system in New England.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In 1790, Moses Brown built America’s first textile mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The pace of textile production, however, remained slow until the Embargo Act of 1807 and the War of 1812 stimulated domestic production.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_94"/>3<span class="C344">.</span>In 1813, Francis Cabot Lowell and a group of investors known as the Boston Associates constructed a textile factory in Waltham, Massachusetts. The new mill used modern spinning machines and power looms to produce cheap cloth. Investors earned a 20 percent profit as sales soared from $3,000 in 1814 to $300,000 in 1823.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE LOWELL EXPERIMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Inspired by the success of the Waltham mill, Francis Lowell built a model factory in a village renamed Lowell. Designed to avoid the drab conditions in English mill towns, Lowell featured clean redbrick factories and dormitories.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Lowell hired young New England farm women to work and live in his model town. The women worked 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. They lived together in boarding houses under the watchful eyes of older women who enforced mandatory church attendance and strict evening curfews.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Lowell experiment worked well at first. By the early 1830s, young unmarried women from New England comprised the majority of the workers in Massachusetts’ textile mills.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>LOWELL CHANGES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Conditions at Lowell soon changed as a new generation of owners stressed efficiency and profit margins. In 1834 and 1836, the owners cut wages without reducing working hours.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The women responded by going out on strike. They unsuccessfully petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to pass a law enacting a 10-hour workday.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The strike convinced owners that the female workers were too troublesome. Factory owners increasingly hired impoverished Irish immigrants who were pouring into Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The factory system quickly spread from the textile industry to the production of shoes and guns.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The rise of commerce and industry spurred the growth of cities as the population of places with 8,000 or more inhabitants jumped from 3 percent in 1790 to 16 percent in 1860. During this period, New York City became the first city in America to boast a population of more than a million people.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Immigration to America slowed dramatically during the four decades between the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. The French Revolution and the prolonged war between Great Britain and France reduced immigration to a trickle.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The first great wave of nineteenth-century immigration took place between 1820 and 1860. During this period, 5 million people immigrated to America. While many immigrants came from England and Scandinavia, over two-thirds of the total came from Ireland and Germany.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: IRISH AND GERMAN IMMIGRATION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Irish</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Desperate living conditions in Ireland made mass immigration inevitable. Beginning in 1845, a blight destroyed three successive potato crops. One million Irish died from starvation and disease, while another 1.7 million immigrated to the United States.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>Most Irish immigrants settled in Northeastern port cities. By 1860, the Irish comprised over one-third of the population of New York City and Boston.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">c.</span>Most Irish immigrants were forced to work in the lowest-paying, most demanding unskilled jobs. The percentage of Irish workers employed in the Lowell mills jumped from 8 percent in 1845 to 50 percent in 1860.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">d.</span>Irish voters supported the Democrats as the party of the “common man.” Irish bosses soon played a key role in the formation of big city political machines.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">e.</span>The Irish played a major role in the growth of the Catholic Church in the United States. The number of Catholic churches in America increased from 700 in 1840 to over 2,500 in 1860.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Germans</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">a.</span>Political instability and economic unrest prompted over 1.5 million Germans to immigrate to America between 1830 and 1860.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426">b.</span>German immigrants typically settled in rural areas in the Midwest rather than in East Coast port cities.</p>
<p class="C419"><span class="C426"><span id="page_96"/>c.</span>German immigrants were a very diverse group that included exiled political refugees and displaced farmers. Although the majority of Germans were Protestants, about one-third were Catholics and a significant number were Jewish.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: NATIVISM</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The great wave of Irish immigration sparked a nativist or anti-foreign reaction. Prejudiced employers posted “No Irish Need Apply” signs, while Protestant leaders complained that Irish-sponsored parochial schools would undermine support for public education.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Convinced that the Irish would never assimilate into American life, nativists formed groups with the political goal of restricting immigration and making naturalization a much longer process. During the 1850s, a political party known as the Know-Nothings demanded laws that would allow only native-born Americans to hold political office.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Know-Nothings marked the beginning of a recurring pattern of nativist opposition to immigration. During the late 1890s and early 1900s, a wave of so-called “New Immigrants” from southern and eastern Europe sparked a new outburst of nativism. Members of the Immigrant Restriction League believed that the New Immigrants posed a threat to the American way of life because they were racially inferior to Anglo-Saxons. Nativist opposition became so strong that in 1924 Congress passed a law severely cutting the flow of immigration into the United States.</p>
