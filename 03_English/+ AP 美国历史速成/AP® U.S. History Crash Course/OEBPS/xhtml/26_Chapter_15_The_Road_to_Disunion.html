<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>On January 24, 1848, a carpenter named James Marshall spotted shiny yellow objects glittering at the bottom of the American River not far from Sacramento, California. The sight “made my heart thump,” Marshall later recalled. “I was certain it was gold.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Marshall’s discovery triggered a frenzied rush of fortune seekers hoping to strike it rich. By the end of 1849, over 80,000 prospectors swarmed into California. The new Californians promptly drew up a constitution asking Congress to admit them into the Union as a free state.</p>

<p class="C568"><strong><em>The gold rush transformed San Francisco from a tiny village into a booming port city.

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>RENEWED DEBATES OVER SLAVERY</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>California’s petition for statehood renewed the still unresolved debate over the spread of slavery into the territories won in the Mexican War.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Southern leaders feared the North’s growing political dominance. Augmented by a surging tide of immigrants from Ireland and Germany, Northern states held a commanding majority in the House of Representatives. However, the equal division of 15 slave states and 15 free states enabled the South to maintain a veto power in the Senate.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Reaching an agreement with the South proved to be difficult. Southern senators repeatedly warned that any law threatening <span id="page_114"/>slavery would lead to secession. Sensing that “our country is in danger,” Henry Clay lived up to his reputation as the “Great Compromiser” by proposing a series of measures that passed the Senate after months of intense bargaining.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CLAY’S COMPROMISE PROPOSALS</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Clay grouped six proposals into three pairs. Each pair offered one concession to the North and one to the South.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The first pair admitted California as a free state while also calling for the establishment of territorial governments in the rest of the Mexican Cession “without the adoption of any restriction or condition on the subject of slavery.” This statement conciliated the South by reaffirming the permanence of slavery and rejecting the validity of the Wilmot Proviso.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The second pair settled a heated boundary dispute between Texas and New Mexico. Congress assigned the disputed territory to New Mexico but compensated Texas by paying off a $10 million debt it had incurred while an independent republic.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The third pair abolished the slave trade but not slavery in the District of Columbia. At the same time, Congress recognized Southern complaints by enacting a strict new Fugitive Slave Law.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>“A FINAL SETTLEMENT”</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>In a message to Congress in December 1850, President Fillmore described the Compromise of 1850 as “a final settlement.” Most Americans agreed, believing the compromise would restore sectional harmony.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>With the benefit of hindsight, we know that sectional forces would soon gather strength and ultimately lead to disunion. But the Compromise of 1850 should not be dismissed as unimportant. It bought a decade of delay that enabled the North to gain the industrial strength, population growth, and presidential leadership it would need to successfully face the challenge of secession.</p>

<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Compromise of 1850 initially produced unexpected benefits for the South. Although California entered the Union as a free state, it selected conservative Senators who voted with the South <span id="page_115"/>on most issues. Meanwhile, the territorial legislatures in Utah and New Mexico legalized slavery.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Despite this promising beginning, the agitation over slavery did not end. About 1,000 slaves escaped to freedom each year. Southern leaders viewed enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act as a litmus test of the North’s good faith in enforcing the Compromise of 1850.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>PUBLIC OPPOSITION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Fugitive Slave Act intensified antislavery sentiment because it required Northerners to enforce slavery. In Boston, thousands of outraged abolitionists vainly attempted to prevent federal marshals from returning a fugitive slave to his master in Virginia.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Demonstrations like the one in Boston dramatized public resistance to enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. At the same time, a clandestine network of conductors and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad helped escaped slaves flee to the North. Renowned as “The Moses of Her People,” Harriet Tubman led more than 300 slaves to freedom.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong><em>UNCLE TOM’S CABIN</em></strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Fugitive Slave Act appalled Harriet Beecher Stowe. A dedicated abolitionist, Stowe wrote <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> to help her readers understand the morally intolerable impact of slavery upon family life.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>First published in book form in March 1852, <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> sold 300,000 copies within a year. It soon became an international sensation translated into 20 languages while selling 2.5 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span><em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> intensified antislavery sentiment in the North, and by contrast, aroused deep resentment in the South.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As 1854 began, most Americans believed that the Missouri Compromise line provided a permanent agreement for separating free and slave territory in the Louisiana Purchase. At that time, the Republican Party did not exist and Democrats sympathetic to the <span id="page_116"/>South controlled the White House and Congress. But all this was about to dramatically and irrevocably change.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>As the slavery issue receded, political leaders and the public focused on the need for a transcontinental railroad to facilitate the movement of people and goods across the nation. While everyone agreed on the need for a transcontinental railroad, cities such as New Orleans, St. Louis, and Chicago vigorously competed for the lucrative position of becoming the eastern terminus for the project.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA ACT</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>As the senator from Illinois, Stephen A. Douglas wanted Chicago to be the eastern terminus of the transcontinental railroad. In order to achieve his objective, Douglas had to first persuade Congress to organize the Nebraska Territory and then persuade Southern senators to support giving this prize to a Northern city.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>On January 23, 1854, Douglas introduced a bill that would organize two territories, Kansas and Nebraska. Both territories were north of the line banning slavery. In order to win Southern support, Douglas added an enticing amendment repealing the Missouri Compromise.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Douglas’s bill included a proposal calling for popular sovereignty granting the people of Kansas and Nebraska the sole right to allow or forbid slavery.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Douglas predicted that his bill would “raise a hell of a storm.” However, he believed that passions would subside when the public recognized that climate and soil conditions in the Great Plains would serve as permanent barriers to the expansion of plantation crops and slavery into Kansas and Nebraska. Given these geographic conditions, settlers would inevitably use popular sovereignty to remain free.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>After a prolonged and bitter debate, Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act on May 22, 1854. President Pierce signed it into law eight days later. “Few events,” wrote historian David M. Potter, “have swung American history away from its charted course so suddenly and so sharply as the Kansas-Nebraska Act.”</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MOMENTOUS CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Kansas-Nebraska Act broke the uneasy truce between the North and the South. Indignant Northern Democrats denounced the act as a violation of the Missouri Compromise’s “sacred pledge” to ban slavery north of the 36° 30<strong>′</strong> line.</p>
<p class="C369"><span id="page_117"/>2<span class="C344">.</span>Kansas marked the first important test of popular sovereignty. Within a short time, “Bleeding Kansas” became a battleground between rival proslavery and antislavery settlers.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Democrats and Whigs had formed a Second Party System that dominated American politics from the 1830s to the early 1850s. The furor over the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the violence in Kansas led to the demise of the Whig Party.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>The Kansas-Nebraska Act galvanized a spontaneous outpouring of popular opposition in the North that led to the formation of the Republican Party in 1854. Within a short time, Whigs, antislavery Democrats, Free Soilers, and former Know-Nothings joined the rapidly growing Republican coalition. The rise of the Republican Party began a new Third Party System that dominated American politics until the 1896 presidential election.</p>
<p class="C369">5<span class="C344">.</span>The Kansas-Nebraska Act dealt a severe blow to Douglas’s presidential aspirations. At the same time, it revitalized Abraham Lincoln’s political career. Realizing that his opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act had gone beyond the confines of Whig policy, Lincoln declared himself a Republican.</p>

</table>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE CASE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Dred Scott was a slave who belonged to John Emerson, an army surgeon assigned to a post in Missouri. When the Army transferred Emerson from the slave state of Missouri to the free state of Illinois, he took Scott with him as a servant. The pair then moved to the Wisconsin Territory, an area where the Missouri Compromise expressly forbade slavery.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>When Emerson died, Scott returned to Missouri where he was placed under the authority of his former master’s wife. Helped by abolitionists, Scott sued for his freedom. He contended that living in a free state and a free territory made him a free man.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong><span id="page_118"/>B.</strong></span><strong>THE DECISION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Led by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the Supreme Court ruled that neither slaves nor free blacks were citizens in the political community created by the Constitution. Taney declared that slaves were “chattel property … so far inferior that they have no rights which the white man is bound to respect.”</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The Court ruled that as a constitutionally protected form of property, slaves could be taken into any state or territory. The decision therefore declared the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. This marked the first time the Supreme Court struck down an act of Congress since the <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> decision in 1803.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>UNDERSTANDING CAUSATION: CONSEQUENCES OF THE <em>DRED SCOTT</em> DECISION</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The <em>Dred Scott</em> decision invalidated the Missouri Compromise. It also cast doubt on the validity of popular sovereignty.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>The decision worsened sectional tensions. It strengthened the Southern view that the Constitution safeguarded slavery. It strengthened the Northern view that a relentless Slave Power intended to impose slavery upon the entire nation.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The decision invalidated the Republican Party’s platform pledge opposing the extension of slavery into the territories. Although this initially appeared to be a serious setback, Republicans redoubled their efforts to win the presidency. They promised that a victory would enable them to change the composition of the Southern dominated Supreme Court and reverse the <em>Dred Scott</em> decision.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING CONNECTIONS: AFRICAN AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>The Thirteenth Amendment overturned the <em>Dred Scott</em> decision.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In modern times, the Court has ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment prohibits any action that recognizes a “badge” or “condition” of slavery, such as housing discrimination and certain forms of employment discrimination.</p>

<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>John Brown’s doomed raid on Harpers Ferry set off a wave of fear throughout the slaveholding South. As rumors of slave <span id="page_119"/>insurrections swept across the region, frightened Southerners suppressed all criticism of slavery. Southern “fire eaters” incorrectly linked John Brown to the now-hated Republican Party.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Although his raid was a military failure, John Brown’s capture, trial, and execution mesmerized the nation. His death aroused great sympathy in the North where he became an antislavery martyr celebrated in the song “John Brown’s Body.” Perplexed and angered Southerners accused the North of lionizing a fiend who intended to instigate a bloody slave rebellion.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ELECTION OF 1860</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Unable to bridge the division over slavery, the Democratic Party split into two factions. Northern Democrats nominated Stephen A. Douglas on a platform promising congressional noninterference with slavery. Deep South Democrats nominated John C. Breckinridge on a platform calling for a national slave code that would protect slavery in the territories.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>Republicans sensed that they had an excellent opportunity to defeat the divided Democrats. The Lincoln-Douglas debates transformed Abraham Lincoln into a nationally known figure. The party nominated Lincoln on the third ballot.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>The Republican platform stated that slavery would continue to be protected in the states where it already existed. However, the Republican Party firmly opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories.</p>
<p class="C369">4<span class="C344">.</span>Lincoln won the election by carrying all 18 free states. He did not win a single state in the South.</p>
<p class="C366"><span class="C368"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE CRITTENDEN COMPROMISE</strong></p>
<p class="C369">1<span class="C344">.</span>Lincoln’s election prompted South Carolina and six other Deep South states to secede from the Union.</p>
<p class="C369">2<span class="C344">.</span>In a final desperate effort to save the Union, Senator John Crittenden of Kentucky proposed a binding constitutional amendment to extend the Missouri Compromise line to the West coast.</p>
<p class="C369">3<span class="C344">.</span>Lincoln rejected the Crittenden Compromise because it violated the Republican Party’s steadfast position against the further extension of slavery into the Western territories. The nation thus continued on an inexorable path to disunion and a bloody Civil War.</p>
