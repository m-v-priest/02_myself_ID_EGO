== 释义
all right today APUSH people we’re going to take a look at the period 1824 to 1840. we’re going to review it really quickly so let’s get started. these are the chapters and the APUSH books that we’re going to be reviewing, but pretty much if you’re studying that time period, this is going to help you out.

big idea here: 1824 the election will formally put an end to the Era of Good Feelings 和睦时期. here’s what happens: there’s a whole bunch of Republicans that want to be president - you got John Quincy Adams, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay - they all want to be president. and the results of the election reveal a problem: Jackson wins the popular vote 普选票，he gets the most electoral votes 选举人票，but he does not get a majority of the electoral votes, and under the Constitution 宪法 and the 12th Amendment 修正案 that means the election must go to the House of Representatives 众议院.

now Jackson’s feeling pretty good about this election because he’s the only candidate 候选人 that has support in all the different sections of the country - he’s got Northern voters, Southern voters and Western voters. so the election goes to the house, and this is the background to the corrupt bargain 腐败交易.

here’s what goes down: as I said under the 12th Amendment, they must choose (the house of reps must choose between the top three candidates). William Crawford is out because he suffers a stroke 中风 during the campaign 竞选活动. and the speaker of the house is Henry Clay - he has something in common with John Quincy Adams: they’re both supporters of the American system - they’re down with the Tariff 关税，the bank, and the internal improvements 国内建设. they have a very similar political philosophy 政治理念.

the Speaker of the House Henry Clay throws his support behind John Quincy Adams, and next thing you know John Quincy Adams is named president of the United States by the house of reps. and a couple weeks later, he has picked Henry Clay to be the Secretary of State 国务卿. and this is a really awesome position because three of the former presidents were Secretary of State prior to becoming president - it’s kind of seen as a stepping stone 垫脚石. Jackson and his supporters see this as corruption 腐败 - this is a bribe 贿赂 - it looks like Henry Clay got to become Secretary of State in exchange for supporting John Quincy Adams for president. and Jackson’s peeps denounce 谴责 this as the corrupt bargain, and Jackson is pissed 生气的.

in fact, once John Quincy Adams becomes president, it’s not exactly a fairy tale ending 童话般的结局. remember as foreign Secretary of State he had achieved a huge amount (some of those treaties 条约 you see right there), but as president he had tremendous difficulties. when he takes office 就职 in 1825, he never really had the majority of support; there’s charges of corruption kind of hanging over his administration 政府；he doesn’t use the spoils system 分赃制 to reward those who are loyal to him; and as a result his presidency 总统任期 is going to be basically uneventful 平淡无奇的.

and what happens after 1824 is you get this final split 分裂 amongst United Republicans - you know that Era of Good Feelings is all over - and what you see is the people who support John Quincy Adams become known as the National Republicans, and the people who are supporting Jackson are more of the old school Democratic Republicans (eventually going to be known as the Democrats).

so there’s a whole bunch of stuff happening, but in 1828 the next election takes place. there’s a lot of dirty campaigning 不道德的竞选活动，and the results once again are voted on by sectional lines 按地区划分. John Quincy Adams is running for reelection 竞选连任 - he does get the Northeast because of his support for manufacturing - but ultimately he loses, and Andrew Jackson crushes 彻底击败 John Quincy Adams in the rematch 复赛.

not only that, but when Jackson becomes president with the election of 1828, he will be the first president from the west (from the state of Tennessee), and he is really symbolic 象征性的 of this idea of the Common Man 普通人 - a man without formal schooling 正规教育. in fact, one of the big reasons why Jackson wins is because of something that was going on in American society all the way back in 1800 and beyond, and that is democratization 民主化 of American society. most states (if you look at these two maps) were eliminating property requirements 财产要求 for voting, and so it was becoming more and more open the political system because you were moving towards universal white male suffrage 普选权 - the right to vote. now left out of this democratization were of course women, African - Americans, Native Americans, and any group not being in the white male category, but this was an enormous trend 巨大趋势 in American politics and an important one that Jackson benefits from.

Jackson’s inauguration 就职典礼 is very symbolic as this victory for the common man. thousands and thousands of people come to Washington DC to celebrate Jackson’s presidency. and Jackson as president is going to be symbolic of the political changes of the time. back in the day from 1790 to 1828, the way candidates were picked was something called the caucus system 党团会议制度，and what that was was a small group of individuals within the party would choose the candidate. following 1828 you have this move to the party convention 政党大会 where all the members from the political party would nominate 提名 the candidate, and this was seen as more democratic and more open and more kind of in line with the times 符合时代潮流.

another important thing about Jackson that you should be aware of is the spoils system. Jackson’s not the only one to do it, but he does it more than any other president up until that point, and that is rewarding political supporters with public office ("if you support me, I’m going to appoint 任命 you to a position within the government"). and for Jackson, he defended this on democratic grounds - you’re opening up politics to new and more people - but there was a downside, and that is corruption and ineffectiveness 无效率，because if you’re being appointed because of your loyalty 忠诚 rather than your merit 功绩，you’re going to get people that are not very good in those positions. but the spoils system was used by Jacksonians as a way to bring in new people into politics.

now a big crisis that’s going to occur under Andrew Jackson is going to be the nullification crisis 否决危机，and here’s what happens: 1828 Congress 国会 passes a tariff - Northerners love it, Southerners hate it. sectionalism 地方主义 is on the rise again because you have this dispute 争论 over whether or not a tariff is good or bad. what happens is Southerners refer to the Tariff as the Tariff of Abominations (we have a video on that - check it out in more detail). a pamphlet 小册子 was written anonymously 匿名地 by the Vice President John C. Calhoun called the South Carolina exposition 博览会，and in this pamphlet they basically outlined the theory of nullification 否决理论. and that theory basically said a state had the right to decide whether to obey a federal law 联邦法律 or to nullify it or to ignore it within that state. and remember this was done during the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions 决议 by Jefferson and Madison as a result of the Sedition Act 煽动叛乱法 passed by the Federalist Congress and John Adams. and so South Carolina says "we have the right to nullify this," but they don’t have the two - thirds votes necessary to do so.

but Congress passes another tariff in 1832, and this tariff (even though it lowers the rates) angers Southerners, and South Carolina is pissed and they approve nullification and basically say that the tax (the Tariff) would not be collected in the state of South Carolina, and they threaten secession 脱离；退出联盟 ("if you try to collect this tax, we’re going to leave the union"), and this is a crisis known as the Nullification Crisis.

now Jackson is not a fan of the Tariff, but he is the president and he wants to defend the union, and this crisis (which really had the nation on the brink of 处于…… 的边缘 a mini Civil War 内战) is solved by something called the olive branch 橄榄枝 and the sword 剑. one, the sword: the force bill 武力法案 of 1833 - the federal army was told that we could collect the Tariff - nullification would not be tolerated ("so South Carolina you better pay up"). the second part of that (or the Olive Branch piece) is the compromise tariff 妥协关税 negotiated 谈判 by Henry Clay known as the Tariff of 1833 which will gradually lower the Tariff rates. the crisis ends and nullification was rescinded 废除 - South Carolina backs down 让步，the union is preserved 保住. but what’s important about this is this is really a sign of things to come, because compromise won’t work once we get to 1860, and we have South Carolina actually being the state (the first state) to leave the union upon the election of Lincoln.

other things about Jackson you should be aware of is the pattern that was happening way before Jackson was population was moving west, and a big part of Jackson’s presidency is going to be his native policy 印第安人政策. his goal was he wanted to open up land in the southwest for southern planters 种植园主. Jackson already had a reputation - he had fought native people in Florida with that unauthorized military expedition 未经授权的军事远征 just before the Adams - Onís treaty, and now he along with Congress support the Indian Removal Act 印第安人迁移法案 of 1830. and this basically says in the Five Civilized tribes 五大文明部落 were supposed to be removed from this area in the southwest or southeast (depending upon where you’re looking at it from) - the Chickasaw, the Choctaw, the creek, the Cherokee, and the Seminole were supposed to be removed as a result west of the Mississippi River, and this was going to be a forced removal 强制迁移.

some of the tribes decided to leave like the Choctaw and the Chickasaw without much resistance 抵抗. and these Five Civilized Tribes (many of them including the Cherokee) had adopted numerous things that were quote - unquote "civilized" - like they own private property 私有财产，many of them were Christian; in fact, they were so civilized some even owned slaves (sarcasm 讽刺 intended).

here’s what happens as a result of the Indian Removal Act: Jackson’s policy is going to lead to the uprooting 连根拔起；迫使离开家园 of thousands of native people. in fact, some are going to resist - the Seminole Indians in Florida are going to refuse to leave, and you’re going to have something called the second Seminole War 第二次塞米诺尔战争 happening in 1835 - a brutal 残酷的 war between the US Army and the Seminole native people, and eventually the Seminole will be defeated.

another important thing you should keep in mind is the Supreme Court 最高法院 actually protects the rights of one of the groups (the Cherokee Indian) in the case of Worcester versus Georgia in 1832. the court rules 裁决 that Georgia law does not apply to the Cherokee Nation 切罗基部落，and the Cherokee Nation cannot be forced to move by the US government because Georgia law doesn’t apply to them. however, famously Jackson chooses to ignore the federal Court’s decision - he famously says "John Marshall has made his decision - let him enforce 执行 it if he can." and as a result, in 1838 (after Jackson had already left office), the Trail of Tears 血泪之路 takes place - the forced removal of over 15,000 Cherokee Native people west of the Mississippi to Oklahoma territory. thousands of Cherokee will die during this horrific 可怕的 event in our American past.

another thing to keep in mind is what happens with the bank in Andrew Jackson. in 1816, remember the US Congress under the American system gave the bank of the United States another 20 - year charter 特许状，and it wasn’t due to expire 到期 until 1836. but Henry Clay decides that he’s going to bring this issue up in the election of 1832 by approving it a little early - he wants to make this bank issue an issue that Andrew Jackson has to deal with.

now Jackson in 1832 decides to veto 否决 the recharter 重新颁发特许状 of the Second Bank of the United States, and some in Congress accuse 指责 him of exercising too much power. now what ends up happening is recall in 1819 the Supreme Court had ruled that the National Bank was constitutional 合宪的 in the famous Supreme Court case McCulloch versus Maryland. not only that, but Jackson’s veto of the bank was seen by many of his opponents as another veto, and he was seen by some his critics as vetoing excessively 过度地 and abusing executive power 滥用行政权力. and a little fun fact is Andrew Jackson had vetoed more times than all the other previous presidents combined.

so he vetoes the bank, and in 1832 Henry Clay goes down in defeat 失败 in the presidential election - Andrew Jackson wins. and Jackson, not content with letting the bank just exist as is, he decides he’s going to destroy the bank prior to 1836, and he does so by ordering the withdrawal 撤回 of federal funds 联邦资金 from the bank in 1833, and he actually puts these federal funds into what are called pet banks 受宠银行 - banks or State Banks that were loyal to the Democratic party (hence 因此 the name pet banks).

the head of the bank (a guy by the name of Nicholas Biddle) calls in the loans 收回贷款 that were due to the Federal National Bank, and this causes all sorts of widespread economic uncertainty 不确定性，panic 恐慌，and the economy basically collapses 崩溃. in fact, they try to kind of calm the situation down because in 1836 the specie circular 硬币通告 is issued which requires that public land be purchased with gold or silver (so - called hard currency 硬通货). however, it’s too little too late because in 1837 (after Jackson’s out of office) you have the panic of 1837, and it’s caused by a whole bunch of factors: over - speculation 过度投机 in Western lands, the bank battle, the specie circular, and the economy just goes into the toilet. and Jackson’s treatment and his bank policies are often times seen as a contributing factor 促成因素 to this panic.

unfortunately for Martin Van Buren, he gets elected in 1836. he’s running against the Whig party 辉格党 (the opposition party 反对党 to Andrew Jackson). you’ll see the Whigs - they run way too many people in 1836. Martin Van Buren becomes the president, and unfortunately he’ll get the really bad nickname (not only is he Wolverine’s Dad) but he is called Martin Van Ruin because as soon as he takes office, the whole panic in the economy goes into a tailspin 急剧下降.

there are new political parties that are forming. recall the Democrats: they believe in a small national government; they’re more in line with 与…… 一致 the old school Democratic Republicans; they basically believe the federal government should stay out of economic affairs (no tariffs, no banks, things of that nature); they also believe the federal government should stay out of social issues; and of course their strength is mainly going to be in the South, the west, and amongst workers in urban areas.

the new party that forms are the Whigs, and they’re kind of similar to the Federalist or the national Republicans - they favor a strong central government (so people like Henry Clay); they believe in the American system (internal improvements, the bank, and tariffs); and they tended to support some of the moral reform movements (the prohibition 禁止 of liquor 酒，the support for public schooling, and things like this). their support tended to be in areas in New England amongst Protestants 新教徒 and religious people and so on. so you have this second party system 第二政党体系，and you could see that being developed on this chart right here. some major events, and the Democrats and the Whigs are going to be the two top dogs 最重要的人物或团体 in the 1830s, and the Whigs really are the opposition party to Andrew Jackson’s policies.

one last thing before we head out: Mexico wins its independence 独立 from Spain in 1821, and basically Mexico (the Mexican Government) gives a bunch of land to a lot of Americans who start coming into Texas. one of the famous ones was a guy by the name of Stephen Austin - he’s given huge amounts of land in what is today modern Texas. there were a couple of rules: one, you had to become Catholic, and you had to follow Mexican law. the problem is so many Americans are coming in with their slaves, and Mexico decides in 1830 to put restrictions 限制 on further immigration 移民. they also decide to outlaw 宣布…… 不合法 slavery, and this angers those white people (those Americans) that are now in Texas.

as a result, in 1836 (as a result of this - you know, Mexico trying to control Texas and the Texans not wanting to be controlled), in 1836 Texas declares its independence from Mexico. not wanting to allow them to leave, Santa Anna sends 6,000 troops 军队 into Texas to basically regulate 管制 and stop this independence movement from being successful. of course you have very famous moments like the 13 - day siege 围攻 at the Alamo where 200 Texans are eventually killed after fighting bravely by the Mexican Army. and while that is taking place, Sam Houston (the hero of the Texas movement for independence) wins a decisive battle 决定性战役 at the Battle of San Jacinto.


now what ends up happening is this causes a major issue 重大问题 because Texas decides when it’s the Lone Star Republic (it’s its own nation) in 1836. Santa Anna rejects 拒绝 the treaty 条约 that he was forced to sign - he says "no I don’t agree that Texas is independent." in fact, Texas in 1837 is recognized 承认 by Andrew Jackson just as he’s about to leave office - he says "yes we recognize the Republic of Texas." the problem that arises though is that Texas wants admission 加入 into the union, and nobody wants to be the one to take this issue on because this is a contentious 有争议的 issue because if Texas gets added to the union, would this be another slave state? and the answer is it would, and Northerners were not going to have this. so the issue of Texas is going to be sidestepped 回避 by many presidents because of the issue of slavery. to be continued.

one last thing before we close out: in 1840 you do get the first Whig president elected. the war hero (the Battle of Tippecanoe) William Henry Harrison runs for the presidency. he’s battling Martin Van Buren (Wolverine’s dad), and what ends up happening is you have the very famous Log Cabin campaign 小木屋竞选活动 where William Henry Harrison adopts this kind of symbolism 象征意义 of the log cabin 小木屋 and hard cider 苹果酒 (you know, these are the symbols of his campaign) because he wants to appeal to the masses 吸引大众. and this was not really based upon any reality, but it works, and in 1840 William Henry Harrison is elected as the oldest man up until that point to take the presidency (68 years old back then), and he dies 32 days after taking office being our shortest - termed president 任期最短的总统 ever.

that’s going to close us out. make sure you subscribe to Joe productions for more quick APUSH review videos. thanks for watching, click like, and have a good day. peace.

好的，各位APUSH的同学们，今天我们要回顾1824年至1840年这段时期。我们将快速地进行回顾，让我们开始吧。这些是我们即将回顾的章节和APUSH书籍，但如果你正在学习那个时期，这会对你有所帮助。

核心思想：1824年的选举将正式结束“美好时代”。事情是这样的：一大堆共和党人都想当总统——有约翰·昆西·亚当斯、威廉·克劳福德、安德鲁·杰克逊、亨利·克莱——他们都想当总统。选举结果揭示了一个问题：杰克逊赢得了普选票，他获得了最多的选举人票，但他没有获得多数选举人票，根据宪法和第十二修正案，这意味着选举必须交给众议院决定。

现在杰克逊对这次选举感觉相当好，因为他是唯一一位在全国各个地区都获得支持的候选人——他拥有北方选民、南方选民和西部选民的支持。因此，选举进入众议院，这就引出了“腐败交易”的背景。

事情是这样的：正如我所说，根据第十二修正案，众议院必须在前三名候选人中做出选择。威廉·克劳福德在竞选期间中风，出局了。众议院议长是亨利·克莱——他和约翰·昆西·亚当斯有一个共同点：他们都是“美国体系”的支持者——他们赞成关税、银行和国内改善。他们有着非常相似的政治理念。

众议院议长亨利·克莱转而支持约翰·昆西·亚当斯，接下来发生的事情是，约翰·昆西·亚当斯被众议院任命为美国总统。几周后，他选择了亨利·克莱担任国务卿。这是一个非常重要的职位，因为之前的三位总统在成为总统之前都曾担任国务卿——这被视为一种晋升的阶梯。杰克逊和他的支持者认为这是腐败——这是贿赂——看起来亨利·克莱为了支持约翰·昆西·亚当斯当选总统而获得了国务卿的职位。杰克逊的支持者谴责这是“腐败交易”，杰克逊非常生气。

事实上，约翰·昆西·亚当斯成为总统后，事情并不像童话故事那样美好。记住，作为外交国务卿，他取得了巨大的成就（你可以在那里看到一些条约），但作为总统，他面临着巨大的困难。1825年他上任时，从未真正获得多数支持；关于腐败的指控一直困扰着他的政府；他没有使用“分赃制度”来奖励那些忠于他的人；结果，他的总统任期基本上毫无建树。

1824年后发生的事情是，统一的共和党人最终分裂了——你知道“美好时代”已经结束了——你看到的是那些支持约翰·昆西·亚当斯的人被称为国民共和党人，而那些支持杰克逊的人更像是老派的民主共和党人（最终被称为民主党人）。

发生了很多事情，但在1828年举行了下一次选举。竞选活动非常肮脏，选举结果再次按地区划分投票。约翰·昆西·亚当斯竞选连任——由于他对制造业的支持，他确实赢得了东北部——但最终他输了，安德鲁·杰克逊在重赛中击败了约翰·昆西·亚当斯。

不仅如此，当杰克逊在1828年当选总统时，他将是第一位来自西部（田纳西州）的总统，他真正象征着“平民”的思想——一个没有受过正规教育的人。事实上，杰克逊获胜的主要原因之一是美国社会早在1800年及以后就一直在发生的事情，那就是美国社会的民主化。大多数州（如果你看看这两张地图）都在取消投票的财产要求，因此政治体系变得越来越开放，因为你正朝着普遍白人男性普选权——投票权——迈进。当然，妇女、非裔美国人、美洲原住民以及任何不属于白人男性类别的群体都被排除在这种民主化进程之外，但这仍然是美国政治中一个巨大的趋势，也是杰克逊从中受益的重要因素。

杰克逊的就职典礼象征着平民的胜利。成千上万的人来到华盛顿特区庆祝杰克逊就任总统。而作为总统的杰克逊将象征着当时的政治变革。在1790年至1828年期间，候选人的挑选方式被称为“核心小组制度”，即党内一小群人会选择候选人。1828年后，你看到了向政党代表大会的转变，所有政党的成员都会提名候选人，这被认为更民主、更开放、更符合时代潮流。

关于杰克逊，你应该了解的另一个重要的事情是“分赃制度”。杰克逊不是唯一使用这种制度的人，但他比之前的任何一位总统都更频繁地使用它，那就是用公职奖励政治支持者（“如果你支持我，我将任命你担任政府内的职位”）。对于杰克逊来说，他从民主的角度为这种制度辩护——你正在向更多新人开放政治——但它也有缺点，那就是腐败和效率低下，因为如果你是因为忠诚而不是因为才能而被任命，你就会得到那些不太适合这些职位的人。但杰克逊的支持者使用“分赃制度”作为将新人引入政治的一种方式。

现在，安德鲁·杰克逊执政时期将发生一场重大危机，那就是“废除危机”，事情是这样的：1828年国会通过了一项关税——北方人喜欢它，南方人讨厌它。地区主义再次抬头，因为你对关税的好坏存在争议。结果是南方人将这项关税称为“可憎关税”（我们有一个关于此的视频——查看更多细节）。副总统约翰·C·卡尔霍恩匿名撰写了一本名为《南卡罗来纳博览会》的小册子，在这本小册子中，他们基本上概述了“废除论”的理论。该理论基本上认为，一个州有权决定是否遵守联邦法律，或者在该州境内废除或无视该法律。记住，在联邦党控制的国会和约翰·亚当斯通过《煽动叛乱法案》后，杰斐逊和麦迪逊在肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议中也曾这样做过。因此，南卡罗来纳州说“我们有权废除它”，但他们没有获得必要的三分之二的票数来这样做。

但国会在1832年又通过了一项关税，这项关税（尽管降低了税率）激怒了南方人，南卡罗来纳州非常生气，他们批准了废除论，并基本上表示这项税（关税）不会在南卡罗来纳州征收，他们威胁要脱离联邦（“如果你试图征收这项税，我们将离开联邦”），这就是被称为“废除危机”的危机。

现在，杰克逊并不喜欢关税，但他毕竟是总统，他想捍卫联邦，而这场危机（实际上使国家处于一场小型内战的边缘）通过所谓的“橄榄枝与剑”得以解决。第一，剑：1833年的《武力法案》——联邦军队被告知他们可以征收关税——废除论不会被容忍（“所以南卡罗来纳州你最好付钱”）。第二部分（或橄榄枝部分）是由亨利·克莱谈判达成的1833年妥协性关税，该关税将逐步降低关税税率。危机结束，废除论被撤销——南卡罗来纳州退缩了，联邦得以保存。但重要的是，这实际上是未来局势的一个预兆，因为一旦我们到了1860年，妥协将不再奏效，而南卡罗来纳州实际上将成为林肯当选后第一个脱离联邦的州。

关于杰克逊，你应该了解的其他事情是，早在杰克逊之前就出现了一种人口向西迁移的趋势，而杰克逊总统任期的一个重要部分将是他的印第安人政策。他的目标是想为南方种植园主开放西南部的土地。杰克逊已经有了一个名声——在《亚当斯-奥尼斯条约》签署之前，他曾在那次未经授权的军事远征中在佛罗里达与印第安人作战，现在他和国会都支持1830年的《印第安人迁移法案》。该法案基本上规定，西南或东南（取决于你从哪个角度看）地区的五个文明部落——奇克索人、乔克托人、克里克人、切罗基人和塞米诺尔人——应该被强制迁移到密西西比河以西地区。

一些部落，如乔克托人和奇克索人，几乎没有抵抗就决定离开了。而这些五个文明部落（包括许多切罗基人）已经采纳了许多所谓的“文明”的东西——比如他们拥有私有财产，他们中的许多人是基督徒；事实上，他们非常文明，有些人甚至拥有奴隶（讽刺意味）。

以下是《印第安人迁移法案》的结果：杰克逊的政策将导致成千上万印第安人的流离失所。事实上，有些人会抵抗——佛罗里达的塞米诺尔印第安人拒绝离开，你将在1835年看到第二次塞米诺尔战争——美国军队和塞米诺尔印第安人之间的一场残酷的战争，最终塞米诺尔人将被击败。

你应该记住的另一个重要的事情是，最高法院在1832年的伍斯特诉佐治亚州案中实际上保护了一个群体（切罗基印第安人）的权利。法院裁定佐治亚州的法律不适用于切罗基民族，切罗基民族不能被美国政府强迫迁移，因为佐治亚州的法律不适用于他们。然而，众所周知，杰克逊选择无视联邦法院的裁决——他著名地说“约翰·马歇尔已经做出了他的决定——如果他能执行，就让他执行吧”。结果，在1838年（在杰克逊已经离任后），发生了“血泪之路”——超过15000名切罗基印第安人被强行迁移到密西西比河以西的俄克拉荷马领地。成千上万的切罗基人在我们美国历史上这一可怕的事件中丧生。

另一件需要记住的事情是安德鲁·杰克逊时期银行的遭遇。回想一下，在1816年，美国国会在“美国体系”下给予美国银行又一个20年的特许权，该特许权直到1836年才到期。但亨利·克莱决定在1832年的选举中通过提前批准来提出这个问题——他想让银行问题成为安德鲁·杰克逊必须处理的问题。

现在，杰克逊在1832年决定否决美国第二银行的重新特许，国会中的一些人指责他滥用权力。最终发生的事情是，回想一下，在1819年，最高法院在著名的麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案中裁定国家银行符合宪法。不仅如此，杰克逊对银行的否决被他的许多反对者视为又一次否决，一些批评家认为他过度否决并滥用行政权力。一个小趣闻是，安德鲁·杰克逊的否决次数比之前所有总统的总和还要多。

因此，他否决了银行，1832年，亨利·克莱在总统选举中落败——安德鲁·杰克逊获胜。杰克逊并不满足于让银行继续存在，他决定在1836年之前摧毁银行，他通过在1833年下令从银行提取联邦资金来实现这一目标，他实际上将这些联邦资金存入所谓的“宠物银行”——忠于民主党的银行或州银行（因此得名“宠物银行”）。

银行的负责人（一个名叫尼古拉斯·比德尔的人）催收联邦国家银行到期的贷款，这导致了各种各样的广泛的经济不确定性、恐慌，经济基本上崩溃了。事实上，他们试图通过在1836年发布“硬币通令”来缓解局势，该通令要求公共土地必须用黄金或白银（所谓的硬通货）购买。然而，这为时已晚，因为在1837年（杰克逊离任后），发生了1837年的经济恐慌，这由多种因素造成：西部土地的过度投机、银行之战、“硬币通令”，以及经济彻底崩溃。杰克逊对待银行的方式和他的银行政策通常被认为是导致这次恐慌的一个因素。

不幸的是，马丁·范布伦在1836年当选总统。他与辉格党（安德鲁·杰克逊的反对党）竞争。你会看到辉格党在1836年推出了太多候选人。马丁·范布伦成为总统，不幸的是，他得到了一个非常糟糕的绰号（他不仅是金刚狼的父亲），他还被称为“马丁·范毁灭”，因为他一上任，整个经济恐慌就急剧恶化。

新的政党正在形成。回想一下民主党：他们信奉小政府；他们更符合老派民主共和党的思想；他们基本上认为联邦政府应该不干预经济事务（没有关税，没有银行，诸如此类）；他们还认为联邦政府应该不干预社会问题；当然，他们的主要力量将来自南方、西部和城市地区的工人。

新成立的政党是辉格党，他们有点类似于联邦党或国民共和党——他们赞成强大的中央政府（比如亨利·克莱这样的人）；他们信奉“美国体系”（国内改善、银行和关税）；他们倾向于支持一些道德改革运动（禁酒、支持公立学校等）。他们的支持者倾向于来自新英格兰地区的清教徒和宗教人士等等。因此，你看到了这个第二政党体系，你可以在右边的图表中看到它的发展。一些重大事件，民主党和辉格党将在1830年代成为两大主要政党，辉格党实际上是安德鲁·杰克逊政策的反对党。

在我们结束之前最后一件事：墨西哥于1821年赢得独立于西班牙，基本上墨西哥（墨西哥政府）将大量土地给予开始进入德克萨斯州的许多美国人。其中一位著名的人物名叫斯蒂芬·奥斯汀——他在今天的现代德克萨斯州获得了大量的土地。有一些规定：第一，你必须成为天主教徒，并且必须遵守墨西哥法律。问题是如此多的美国人带着他们的奴隶涌入，墨西哥在1830年决定限制进一步的移民。他们还决定取缔奴隶制，这激怒了那些现在在德克萨斯州的白人（那些美国人）。

结果，在1836年（由于这个——你知道，墨西哥试图控制德克萨斯，而德克萨斯人不想被控制），在1836年，德克萨斯宣布独立于墨西哥。不希望允许他们离开，桑塔·安纳派遣了6000名士兵进入德克萨斯，基本上是为了管理和阻止这场独立运动取得成功。当然，你有很多著名的时刻，比如阿拉莫的13天围攻，200名德克萨斯人在英勇抵抗墨西哥军队后最终被杀。与此同时，山姆·休斯顿（德克萨斯独立运动的英雄）在圣哈辛托战役中赢得了一场决定性的胜利。

现在发生的事情是，这导致了一个重大问题，因为德克萨斯在1836年决定成为孤星共和国（它是一个独立的国家）。桑塔·安纳拒绝了他被迫签署的条约——他说“不，我不同意德克萨斯是独立的”。事实上，德克萨斯在1837年被即将离任的安德鲁·杰克逊承认——他说“是的，我们承认德克萨斯共和国”。然而，出现的问题是德克萨斯希望加入联邦，但没有人愿意承担这个问题，因为这是一个有争议的问题，因为如果德克萨斯加入联邦，它会成为另一个蓄奴州吗？答案是肯定的，北方人不会同意这一点。因此，由于奴隶制问题，许多总统都回避了德克萨斯问题。未完待续。

在我们结束之前最后一件事：在1840年，你确实看到了第一位辉格党总统当选。战争英雄（蒂珀卡努战役）威廉·亨利·哈里森竞选总统。他与马丁·范布伦（金刚狼的父亲）竞争，结果是，你看到了非常著名的“小木屋竞选”，威廉·亨利·哈里森采用了小木屋和烈性苹果酒的象征意义（你知道，这些是他竞选的象征），因为他想吸引大众。这实际上并非基于任何现实，但它奏效了，1840年，威廉·亨利·哈里森当选为当时最年长的总统（当时68岁），他在上任32天后去世，成为我们历史上任期最短的总统。

all right today APUSH people we're
going to take a look at the period 1824
to 1840. we're going to review it really
quickly so let's get started. these are
the chapters and the APUSH books that
we're going to be reviewing, but pretty
much if you're studying that time period,
this is going to help you out.

big idea
here: 1824 the election will formally put
an end to the Era of Good Feelings.
here's what happens: there's a whole
bunch of Republicans that want to be
president - you got John Quincy Adams,
William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, Henry
Clay - they all want to be president. and
the results of the election reveal a
problem: Jackson wins the popular vote, he
gets the most electoral votes, but he
does not get a majority of the electoral
votes, and under the Constitution and the
12th Amendment that means the election
must go to the House of
Representatives.

now Jackson's feeling
pretty good about this election because
he's the only candidate that has support
in all the different sections of the
country - he's got Northern voters,
Southern voters and Western voters. so
the election goes to the house, and this
is the background to the corrupt bargain.

here's what goes down: as I said under
the 12th Amendment, they must choose (the
house of reps must choose between the
top three candidates). William Crawford is
out because he suffers a stroke during
the campaign. and the speaker of the
house is Henry Clay - he has something in
common with John Quincy Adams: they're
both supporters of the American system -
they're down with the Tariff, the bank,
and the internal improvements. they have
a very similar political philosophy.

the Speaker of the House Henry Clay
throws his support behind John Quincy
Adams, and next thing you know John
Quincy Adams is named president of the
United States by the house of reps. and a
couple weeks later, he has picked Henry
Clay to be the Secretary of
State. and this is a really awesome
position because three of the former
presidents were Secretary of State prior
to becoming president - it's kind of seen
as a stepping stone. Jackson and his
supporters see this as corruption - this
is a bribe - it looks like Henry Clay got
to become Secretary of State in exchange
for supporting John Quincy Adams for
president. and Jackson's peeps denounce
this as the corrupt bargain, and Jackson
is pissed.

in fact, once John Quincy Adams
becomes president, it's not exactly a
fairy tale ending. remember as foreign
Secretary of State he had achieved a
huge amount (some of those treaties you
see right there), but as president he had
tremendous difficulties. when he takes
office in 1825, he never really had the
majority of support; there's charges of
corruption kind of hanging over his
administration; he doesn't use the spoils
system to reward those who are loyal to
him; and as a result his presidency is
going to be basically uneventful.

and
what happens after 1824 is you get this
final split amongst United Republicans -
you know that Era of Good Feelings is
all over - and what you see is the people
who support John Quincy Adams become
known as the National Republicans, and
the people who are supporting Jackson
are more of the old school Democratic
Republicans (eventually going to be known
as the
Democrats).

so there's a whole bunch of
stuff happening, but in 1828 the next
election takes place. there's a lot of
dirty campaigning, and the results once
again are voted on by sectional lines.
John Quincy Adams is running for
reelection - he does get the Northeast
because of his support for manufacturing
- but ultimately he loses, and Andrew
Jackson crushes John Quincy Adams in the
rematch.

not only that, but when Jackson
becomes president with the election of
1828, he will be the first president from
the west (from the state of Tennessee), and
he is really symbolic of this idea of
the Common Man - a man without formal
schooling. in fact, one of the big reasons
why Jackson wins is because of something
that was going on in American society
all the way back in 1800 and beyond, and
that is democratization of American
society. most states (if you look at these
two maps) were eliminating property
requirements for voting, and so it was
becoming more and more open the
political system because you were moving
towards universal white male suffrage -
the right to vote. now left out of this
democratization were of course women,
African-Americans, Native Americans, and
any group not being in the white male
category, but this was an enormous trend
in American politics and an important
one that Jackson benefits from.

Jackson's inauguration is very symbolic
as this victory for the common man.
thousands and thousands of people come
to Washington DC to celebrate Jackson's
presidency. and Jackson as president is
going to be symbolic of the political
changes of the time. back in the day from
1790 to 1828, the way candidates were
picked was something called the caucus
system, and what that was was a small
group of individuals within the party
would choose the candidate. following
1828 you have this move to the party
convention where all the members from
the political party would nominate the
candidate, and this was seen as more
democratic and more open and more kind
of in line with the times.

another
important thing about Jackson that you
should be aware of is the spoils system.
Jackson's not the only one to do it, but
he does it more than any other president
up until that point, and that is
rewarding political supporters with
public office ("if you support me, I'm
going to appoint you to a position
within the government"). and for Jackson, he
defended this on democratic grounds -
you're opening up politics to new and
more people - but there was a downside, and
that is corruption and ineffectiveness,
because if you're being appointed
because of your loyalty rather than your
merit, you're going to get people that
are not very good in those positions. but
the spoils system was used by Jacksonians
as a way to bring in new people into
politics.

now a big crisis that's going
to occur under Andrew Jackson is going
to be the nullification crisis, and
here's what happens: 1828 Congress passes
a tariff - Northerners love it, Southerners
hate it. sectionalism is on the rise
again because you have this dispute over
whether or not a tariff is good or bad.
what happens is Southerners refer to the
Tariff as the Tariff of Abominations (we
have a video on that - check it out in
more detail). a pamphlet was written
anonymously by the Vice President John C.
Calhoun called the South Carolina
exposition, and in this pamphlet they
basically outlined the theory of
nullification. and that theory basically
said a state had the right to decide
whether to obey a federal law or to
nullify it or to ignore it within that
state. and remember this was done during
the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions by
Jefferson and Madison as a result of the
Sedition Act passed by the Federalist
Congress and John Adams. and so South
Carolina says "we have the right to
nullify this," but they don't have the
two-thirds votes necessary to do so.

but
Congress passes another tariff in
1832, and this tariff (even though it
lowers the rates) angers Southerners, and
South Carolina is pissed and they
approve
nullification and basically say that the
tax (the Tariff) would not be collected in
the state of South Carolina, and they
threaten secession ("if you try to
collect this tax, we're going to leave
the union"), and this is a crisis known as
the Nullification Crisis.

now Jackson is
not a fan of the Tariff, but he is the
president and he wants to defend
the union, and this crisis (which really
had the nation on the brink of a mini
Civil War) is solved by something called
the olive branch and the sword. one, the
sword: the force bill of 1833 - the federal
army was told that we could collect the
Tariff - nullification would not be
tolerated ("so South Carolina you better
pay up"). the second part of that (or the
Olive Branch piece) is the compromise
tariff negotiated by Henry Clay known as
the Tariff of 1833 which will
gradually lower the Tariff rates. the
crisis ends and nullification was rescinded
- South Carolina backs down, the
union is preserved. but what's important
about this is this is really a sign of
things to come, because compromise won't
work once we get to 1860, and we have
South Carolina actually being the state
(the first state) to leave the union upon
the election of Lincoln.

other things
about Jackson you should be aware of is
the pattern that was happening way
before Jackson was population was moving
west, and a big part of Jackson's
presidency is going to be his native
policy. his goal was he wanted to open up
land in the southwest for southern
planters. Jackson already had a
reputation - he had fought native people
in Florida with that unauthorized
military expedition just before the
Adams-Onís treaty, and now he along with
Congress support the Indian Removal Act
of 1830. and this basically says in the
Five Civilized tribes were supposed to
be removed from this area in the
southwest or southeast (depending upon
where you're looking at it from) - the
Chickasaw, the Choctaw, the creek, the
Cherokee, and the Seminole were supposed to
be removed as a result west of the
Mississippi River, and this was going to
be a forced removal.

some of the tribes
decided to leave like the Choctaw and the
Chickasaw without much resistance. and
these Five Civilized Tribes (many of them
including the Cherokee) had adopted
numerous things that were quote-unquote
"civilized" - like they own private property,
many of them were Christian; in fact, they
were so civilized some even owned slaves
(sarcasm intended).

here's what happens as
a result of the Indian Removal Act:
Jackson's policy is going to lead to the
uprooting of thousands of native people.
in fact, some are going to resist - the
Seminole Indians in Florida are going to
refuse to leave, and you're going to have
something called the second Seminole War
happening in 1835 - a brutal war
between the US Army and the Seminole native
people, and eventually the Seminole will be
defeated.

another important thing you
should keep in mind is the Supreme Court
actually protects the rights of one of
the groups (the Cherokee Indian) in the
case of Worcester versus Georgia in
1832. the court rules that Georgia law
does not apply to the Cherokee Nation,
and the Cherokee Nation cannot be forced
to move by the US government because
Georgia law doesn't apply to them.
however, famously Jackson chooses to
ignore the federal Court's decision - he
famously says "John Marshall has made his
decision - let him enforce it if he can."
and as a result, in 1838 (after Jackson
had already left office), the Trail of
Tears takes place - the forced removal of
over 15,000 Cherokee Native people west
of the Mississippi to Oklahoma
territory. thousands of Cherokee will die
during this horrific event in our
American past.

another thing to keep in
mind is what happens with the bank in
Andrew Jackson. in 1816, remember the US
Congress under the American system gave
the bank of the United States another
20-year charter, and it wasn't due to
expire until 1836. but Henry Clay decides
that he's going to bring this issue up
in the election of 1832 by approving it
a little early - he wants to make this
bank issue an issue that Andrew Jackson
has to deal with.

now Jackson in 1832
decides to veto the recharter of the
Second Bank of the United States, and
some in Congress accuse him of
exercising too much power. now what ends
up happening is recall in 1819 the
Supreme Court had ruled that the
National Bank was constitutional in the
famous Supreme Court case McCulloch versus
Maryland. not only that, but Jackson's
veto of the bank was seen by many of his
opponents as another veto, and he was
seen by some his critics as vetoing
excessively and abusing executive power.
and a little fun fact is Andrew Jackson
had vetoed more times than all the other
previous presidents combined.

so he vetoes
the bank, and in 1832 Henry Clay goes
down in defeat in the presidential
election - Andrew Jackson wins. and Jackson,
not content with letting the bank just
exist as is, he decides he's going to
destroy the bank prior to 1836, and he
does so by ordering the withdrawal of federal funds from the bank in
1833, and he actually puts these federal
funds into what are called pet banks -
banks or State Banks that were loyal to
the Democratic party (hence the name pet
banks).

the head of the bank (a guy by the
name of Nicholas Biddle) calls in the loans
that were due to the Federal National
Bank, and this causes all sorts of
widespread economic uncertainty, panic,
and the economy basically collapses. in
fact, they try to kind of calm the
situation down because in 1836 the
specie circular is issued which
requires that public land be purchased
with gold or silver (so-called hard
currency). however, it's too little too
late because in 1837 (after Jackson's out
of office) you have the panic of 1837, and
it's caused by a whole bunch of factors:
over-speculation in Western lands, the bank
battle, the specie circular, and the
economy just goes into the toilet. and
Jackson's treatment and his bank
policies are often times seen as a
contributing factor to this panic.

unfortunately for Martin Van Buren, he
gets elected in 1836. he's running
against the Whig party (the opposition
party to Andrew Jackson). you'll see the
Whigs - they run way too many people in
1836. Martin Van Buren becomes the
president, and unfortunately he'll get
the really bad nickname (not only is he
Wolverine's Dad) but he is called Martin
Van Ruin because as soon as he takes
office, the whole panic in the economy
goes into a tailspin.

there are new political parties
that are forming. recall the Democrats:
they believe in a small national
government; they're more in line with the
old school Democratic Republicans; they
basically believe the federal government
should stay out of economic affairs (no
tariffs, no banks, things of that nature);
they also believe the federal government
should stay out of social issues; and of
course their strength is mainly going to
be in the South, the west, and amongst
workers in urban areas.

the new party
that forms are the Whigs, and they're kind
of similar to the Federalist or the
national Republicans - they favor a strong
central government (so people like Henry
Clay); they believe in the American system
(internal improvements, the bank, and
tariffs); and they tended to support some
of the moral reform movements (the
prohibition of liquor, the support for
public schooling, and things like this).
their support tended to be in areas in
New England amongst Protestants and
religious people and so on. so you have
this second party system, and you could
see that being developed on this chart
right here. some major events, and the
Democrats and the Whigs are going to be
the two top dogs in the 1830s, and the
Whigs really are the opposition party to
Andrew Jackson's
policies.

one last thing before we head
out: Mexico wins its independence from
Spain in 1821, and basically Mexico
(the Mexican Government) gives a bunch of
land to a lot of Americans who start
coming into Texas. one of the famous ones
was a guy by the name of Stephen Austin -
he's given huge amounts of land in what
is today modern Texas. there were a
couple of rules: one, you had to become
Catholic, and you had to follow Mexican
law. the problem is so many Americans are
coming in with their slaves, and Mexico
decides in 1830 to put restrictions on
further immigration. they also decide to
outlaw slavery, and this angers those
white people (those Americans) that are
now in
Texas.

as a result, in 1836 (as a result of
this - you know, Mexico trying to control
Texas and the Texans not wanting to be
controlled), in 1836 Texas declares its
independence from Mexico. not wanting to
allow them to leave, Santa Anna sends
6,000 troops into Texas to basically
regulate and stop this independence
movement from being successful. of course
you have very famous moments like the
13-day siege at the Alamo where 200
Texans are eventually killed after
fighting bravely by the Mexican Army. and
while that is taking place, Sam
Houston (the hero of the Texas movement
for independence) wins a decisive battle
at the Battle of San
Jacinto.

now what ends up happening is this
causes a major issue because Texas
decides when it's the Lone Star Republic
(it's its own nation) in
1836. Santa Anna rejects the treaty
that he was forced to sign - he says "no I
don't agree that Texas is independent." in
fact, Texas in 1837 is recognized by
Andrew Jackson just as he's about to
leave office - he says "yes we recognize
the Republic of Texas." the problem that
arises though is that Texas wants
admission into the union, and nobody
wants to be the one to take this issue
on because this is a contentious issue
because if Texas gets added to the union,
would this be another slave state? and the
answer is it would, and Northerners were
not going to have this. so the issue of
Texas is going to be sidestepped by many
presidents because of the issue of
slavery. to be continued.

one last thing
before we close out: in 1840 you do get
the first Whig president elected. the war
hero (the Battle of Tippecanoe) William Henry
Harrison runs for the presidency. he's
battling Martin Van Buren (Wolverine's
dad), and what ends up happening is you
have the very famous Log Cabin campaign
where William Henry Harrison adopts this
kind of symbolism of the log cabin and
hard cider (you know, these are the
symbols of his campaign) because he
wants to appeal to the masses. and this
was not really based upon any reality,
but it works, and in 1840 William Henry
Harrison is elected as the oldest man up
until that point to take the presidency
(68 years old back then), and he dies 32
days after taking office being our
shortest-termed president ever.

that's
going to close us out. make sure you
