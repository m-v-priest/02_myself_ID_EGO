What up APUSH people? 怎么了，美国历史课程（APUSH）的同学们？Today we're going to take a look at 看一看 APUSH period 5 key concept 5.2, and we have a bunch of key things you need to keep in mind for this key concept. It's huge. The North and the South will continue to develop into two distinct societies 截然不同的社会 that will have difficulty trusting one another. The idea of manifest destiny 天定命运论 and the movement West 西进运动 will once again bring up the divisive issue 分裂性问题 of slavery 奴隶制 in the territories 领土. Sectionalism 地方主义 will increasingly become a problem in the 1840s and 1850s, and this thing's going to end in a civil war 内战. And efforts at compromise 妥协 will ultimately fail to decrease sectional tension 地区紧张局势.

And so where we last left off in 5.1 was a whole lot of territorial expansion 领土扩张 taking place -- this idea of manifest destiny. We had Oregon enter the Union 联邦 with the treaty 条约 in 1846 thanks to James K. Polk. Texas was annexed 吞并 in 1845 creating beef with Mexico, and of course ultimately the Mexican-American War 美墨战争 beginning in 1846 -- controversial war 有争议的战争. Whigs 辉格党人 in the north were against it, and Mexico ultimately loses about half of its territory, and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo 瓜达卢佩 - 伊达尔戈条约 in 1848 gives the United States a huge chunk of land 一大片土地 -- about half of Mexico. And many people including Polk were very excited about this huge expansion of American territory.

However, new territories were brought into the Union which forced the issue of slavery into the center of national politics 国家政治核心. And throughout the 1840s and 1850s, you're going to see a tremendous rise in sectional tension 地区紧张局势 between the North and the South. And conflict was caused by territorial expansion -- for instance, the impact of the Mexican-American War. In fact, as soon as the war began, Northerners tried to pass the Wilmot Proviso 威尔莫特但书 which would have banned slavery 禁止奴隶制 in any territory acquired from Mexico. And this attempt to ban slavery in this new territory was rejected by Southerners in the Senate 参议院, and it doesn't go into effect 生效.

When the war is finally over and California attempts to enter the Union as a free state 自由州, this causes a whole outcry 强烈抗议 from the South because it would tip the balance 打破平衡 in favor of the North. And ultimately that was solved by the Compromise of 1850 1850年妥协案 where: one, California was entered into the Union as a free state giving the free states more power in Congress 国会; two, no slave trade 奴隶贸易 in Washington D.C.; three, the issue of slavery in the rest of the territory would be decided by the idea of popular sovereignty 人民主权 where the people in that territory would vote on whether or not to allow slavery; and the fourth piece is a strict new Fugitive Slave Law 逃奴法. So compromise was able to calm sectional tensions 缓解地区紧张局势 following the war temporarily.

However, in the 1850s, challenges to territorial expansion became increasingly common. For instance, when a group of Southerners created the Ostend Manifesto 奥斯坦德宣言 which was a secret plan 秘密计划 by Southerners to buy Cuba from Spain and turn it into slave states 蓄奴州. It was opposed by free soilers 自由土壤论者 in Congress and many Northerners, and President Pierce had to back down on 放弃 this idea. Even something as simple as the Gadsden Purchase 加兹登购地 -- which land was purchased in the Southwest from Mexico in 1853 for the building of a railroad (present day New Mexico and Arizona) -- that provoked 引发 a little bit of controversy 争议 as well between North and South.

And attempts at compromise over slavery ultimately fail to reduce tensions. An example of this can be seen with the Compromise of 1850. The Fugitive Slave Act really provokes a huge controversy 巨大争议 in the North because Northerners suddenly now have to deal with the issue of slavery right in their own backyard 后院（指身边）. And they resist the enforcement 执行 of the Fugitive Slave Act which angers Southerners with things such as personal liberty laws 人身自由法 where they did not allow the use of local jails 监狱 for housing fugitive slaves 逃亡奴隶. Vigilance committees 警戒委员会 were created with the goal of protecting fugitive slaves from the federal slave marshals 联邦奴隶执法官.

And what you see is a huge firestorm 风暴 erupting in 1854 when Stephen Douglas introduces the Kansas-Nebraska Act 堪萨斯 - 内布拉斯加法案. And under the Kansas-Nebraska Act, slavery would be decided in the territories of Kansas and Nebraska based on the idea of popular sovereignty. And ultimately this act -- this proposal 提议 by Stephen Douglas -- repeals 废除 the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协 of 1820 by potentially opening up slavery north of the 36°30' line. And many people in the North including Democrats in some cases oppose this act. It is passed in Congress but there's a huge opposition, and the Republican Party 共和党 is formed, and the Whig Party 辉格党 ultimately disappears over the division 是否支持堪萨斯 - 内布拉斯加法案的分歧 whether or not to support the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Because for Northerners, this is seen as giving the South an opportunity to expand slavery into an area it was previously closed off to 禁止的.

In fact, throughout the 1850s, you're going to see sectional tension increasing as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. You get something called Bleeding Kansas 流血的堪萨斯 where pro-slavery 支持奴隶制的 and anti-slavery forces 反奴隶制力量 engage in 卷入 a mini Civil War in the territory of Kansas. And you get events like the sack of Lawrence 劳伦斯洗劫事件 where pro-slavery supporters attack free soilers 自由土壤派 in the town of Lawrence; Pottawatomie Creek 波塔沃托米溪事件 where John Brown and his followers hacked to death 砍死 pro-slavery supporters; and you have two rival governments 对立政府 in the territory -- Topeka the Free Soil government and Lecompton the pro-slavery government in Kansas. Popular sovereignty was an utter failure 彻底失败.

In fact, the violence of Kansas spread to the halls of Congress 国会大厅 when Northern Republican Charles Sumner was brutally beaten 毒打 by a Southerner Preston Brooks. The big kind of firestorm erupts again with Dred Scott v. Sandford 德雷德·斯科特诉桑福德案 where in 1857 Roger Taney the Supreme Court Justice 最高法院大法官 you see at the top rules in the Dred Scott case -- Dred Scott you see right there -- and he rules a couple of things: one, African-Americans are not citizens 公民; two, slaves are property 财产 and therefore under the Fifth Amendment 第五修正案 cannot be taken away without due process 正当法律程序; and ultimately what the Dred Scott decision says is Congress could not ban slavery from the territories 领土. So therefore the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional 违宪的, and therefore slavery potentially could be opened up anywhere in the nation. And this creates a huge outcry 强烈抗议 from the North.

In fact, over and over again you're going to see the breakdown of compromise 妥协破裂. Once again in 1859, another crisis hits the Union when John Brown -- the guy from Pottawatomie Creek -- hopes to spark a slave revolt 奴隶起义 in Virginia by seizing 占领 the federal arsenal 兵工厂 at Harper's Ferry. Ultimately he fails and is hung, but the South is outraged 愤怒 and it is one of the immediate causes of secession 分裂 because Southerners feel the North is supporting this man John Brown.

In fact, the big kind of key moment happens in 1860 where Lincoln -- not winning a single state in the South -- is elected president. And for Southerners, he is seen as a sectional president 地区性总统, and this is a key turning point 转折点 in the relationship between the North and South and will compel 迫使 seven states to leave the Union before he even takes office 就职.

And one of the other things you see happening in this period is the end of the second party system 第二政党体系. The Whig Party and the Know-Nothing Party -- that nativist party 本土主义政党 -- collapse 瓦解 over the division surrounding the Kansas-Nebraska Act. You get the formation of a new party -- the Republican Party -- which is truly a sectional party 地区性政党 in that it only has support in the North. And their whole platform 纲领 in the beginning is opposed to Kansas-Nebraska Act and they're opposed to the expansion of slavery in the territories. And they're going to increasingly grow in numbers throughout the 1850s as events such as Bleeding Kansas and the Dred Scott case bring people to the Republican Party in the North.

And ultimately with the election of 1860, the Republican Party their platform was no extension of slavery in the territories. They adopt a Free Soil platform 自由土壤纲领. And with Lincoln's election, you get the cause -- the immediate cause of secession because for Southerners, the election of Lincoln was seen as the election of a sectional Northern president hostile to slavery 对奴隶制怀有敌意的.

And one of the other things you should keep in mind when studying this time is the North and the South continue to develop distinct from one another, and sectionalism increases as a result of regional economic changes, demographic changes 人口变化, and cultural differences. So let me break that down for you.

Economically, the North was industrializing 工业化 based upon manufacturing 制造业, free labor 自由劳动. Their demographic reality 人口现实 was very different than the South. They had a large population growth, a huge amount of immigration 移民 -- we saw that in key concept 5.1 with the Irish and the German immigrants coming in. There is a rise of nativism 本土主义 as seen in the Know-Nothing Party, but there's this huge population growth in the North. This nativism is going to be anti-Catholic 反天主教的, and we explored that a little bit already. But ultimately culturally the North is different than the South. And abolitionists 废奴主义者 -- although a small minority 少数 in the North -- they are going to be growing in the 1840s and 1850s.

And for Southerners, their economy is very different. It's based upon agricultural plantation economy 种植园经济 and slave labor 奴隶劳动. Now keep in mind only 25% of Southerners actually own slaves, but slavery is a key part of the Southern way of life. Demographics are not favorable for the South -- they have slow population growth, little to no immigrants coming in. And as a result, you have a very not a very diverse society 多样化社会 in the South. And culturally they are going to increasingly seek to defend the institution of slavery 奴隶制 and the Southern way of life. And you see that over and over again especially in the 1830s and 1840s where Southerners are increasingly defending slavery as a positive good 有益之事.

Two great examples of this is George Fitzhugh and John C. Calhoun who are really kind of the developers of a pro-slavery argument 支持奴隶制的论点. And they talk about slaves as family -- as members of the family -- as opposed to you see in the political cartoon what happens to the poor workers in the North -- they get carted off to 被送往 the poor house 济贫院 while slaves are cared for as a member of the family. They talk about slavery as better than wage slavery 工资奴隶制 in the North, and they talk about this kind of idea that slaves are civilized -- it is civilizing inferior people 使低等人文明化. And this is the kind of core part of their argument to justify 证明……合理 the institution of slavery.

You also see racial stereotyping 种族刻板印象 famously in the minstrel shows  minstrel表演 where very often white actors would paint themselves in blackface 涂黑脸 and act in very stereotypical racist ways. The kind of issue of slavery you can really see how controversial it was and how they tried to avoid it with the gag resolution 禁言决议 which you know from 1836 to 1844 there was a ban on anti-slavery petitions 请愿书 being discussed in Congress. And eventually it will be overturned 推翻 in 1844 by John Quincy Adams.

However, tensions with the Union will mount 加剧. There is an emphasis amongst Southerners especially of states' rights 州权 and this idea of nullification 否决权 where states could void 废除 or nullify a federal law 联邦法律. And this was not unique necessarily to the South, but it became increasingly discussed. We saw this during the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions 肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议 in 1798 where Jefferson and Madison said that they could ignore the Alien and Sedition Acts 客籍法和煽动叛乱法. We saw this in 1828 with the Tariff of Abominations 可憎关税 when South Carolina sought to nullify the tariff. And if you click that you can learn a little bit more about that crisis.

But what happens is the Southerners in the 1840s and 1850s are talking about states' rights, secession 分裂, and nullification more and more frequently. In the North, there is a growing abolitionist movement that you should be aware about and know their different tactics 策略 and strategies. Even though that's the case, in the 1840s and 1850s abolitionists remained a minority in the North. Lincoln himself was not an abolitionist, and he was against the extension of slavery in the territories. Although it is a minority movement, it's becoming an increasingly vocal 直言不讳的 and visible in the '40s and '50s.

You get individuals like William Lloyd Garrison -- one of the founders of the American Anti-Slavery Society 美国反奴隶制协会 in 1833 which calls for immediate uncompensated emancipation 立即无偿解放 and publishes anti-slavery newsletters such as The Liberator 《解放者》. Uncle Tom's Cabin 《汤姆叔叔的小屋》 is a hugely important piece of work by Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1852, and it has a huge role in increasing support for the abolitionist movement in the North. The Underground Railroad 地下铁路 continues to operate helping slaves escape to the North -- the most famous kind of person in this movement Harriet Tubman. But you also get calls for violence, and you get in some rare cases very few examples of actual outbreaks of violence 暴力事件.

David Walker famously in 1829 had the Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World 《向世界有色公民的呼吁》 where he called for a violent uprising 暴力起义 to end slavery. Nat Turner's Rebellion 纳特·特纳起义 in 1831 was the only rebellion that actually led to the death of white people in Virginia. And as a result, you have this huge crackdown 镇压 on the movement of African-Americans throughout the South. And of course, you have John Brown's raid 突袭 in 1859 which strikes a huge amount of fear 恐惧 in the minds of Southerners, and they perceive 认为 John Brown as supported by Northerners -- sent by Northerners to undo 破坏 their Southern institution of slavery.

And a big idea is to understand how the North and the South increasingly distrusted one another. And we've already kind of covered these topics, but it's worth reviewing. For instance, the Northern distrust 不信任 of the South can be seen in the Fugitive Slave Act -- they didn't like these federal marshals running through the North looking for runaway slaves 逃亡奴隶. Uncle Tom's Cabin provoked a huge anti-slavery sentiment 情绪 amongst Northerners who normally never thought about the issue. The events of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the repeal of previous compromise 废除先前的妥协 in the Missouri Compromise caused a lot of distrust amongst Northerners towards the South. The fraudulent government 虚假政府 of Lecompton where they were seeing pro-slavery people from Missouri crossing the border -- that caused distrust. The Ostend Manifesto where it seemed like Southerners were seeking new territory even abroad 海外 to expand their slavocracy 奴隶ocracy（指奴隶制政权） as they called it. The events of Bleeding Sumner where Sumner had beat one of the Northern representatives Charles Sumner. And Dred Scott where a predominantly Southern court 以南方为主的法院 made a decision with huge consequences 后果 about Congress's ability or inability to ban slavery anywhere.

For Southerners, they also had a distrust of the North. For them, they felt the North was attacking their Southern way of life. They saw the Wilmot Proviso as an attempt to try to chip away at 削弱 slavery in any territory that they had won in the Mexican-American War. The Northern resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act was seen as Northern hostility 敌意 to the Southern way of life. The growth of the abolitionist movement threatened Southerners -- even though it remained a minority movement, they reacted to it with their own defense of slavery. And the perceived Northern support for people like John Brown and the events at Harper's Ferry. And ultimately the election in 1860 of a sectional Republican Party candidate Lincoln on a Free Soil platform are all going to create the conditions where compromise was no longer possible and trust was at an all-time low 史上最低.

大家好，APUSH的同学们！今天我们来看一下APUSH第五时期的关键概念5.2，关于这个关键概念，我们需要记住很多关键点。它非常重要。北方和南方将继续发展成为两个截然不同的社会，它们之间将难以相互信任。昭昭天命的思想和西进运动将再次引发在领土问题上具有分裂性的奴隶制问题。地区主义在1840年代和1850年代将日益成为一个问题，最终将导致内战。而旨在减少地区紧张的妥协努力最终将失败。

我们在5.1的最后看到的是大量的领土扩张——昭昭天命的思想。由于詹姆斯·K·波尔克的努力，俄勒冈在1846年通过条约加入了联邦。德克萨斯于1845年被吞并，导致与墨西哥关系紧张，当然最终导致了1846年开始的美墨战争——一场备受争议的战争。北方的辉格党反对这场战争，而墨西哥最终失去了大约一半的领土，《瓜达卢佩-伊达尔戈条约》在1848年给予了美国一大块土地——大约是墨西哥的一半。包括波尔克在内的许多人对美国领土的巨大扩张感到非常兴奋。

然而，新的领土被纳入联邦，这迫使奴隶制问题成为国家政治的中心。在整个1840年代和1850年代，你们将看到北方和南方之间的地区紧张局势急剧加剧。冲突是由领土扩张引起的——例如，美墨战争的影响。事实上，战争一开始，北方人就试图通过《威尔莫特但书》，该但书将禁止在从墨西哥获得的任何领土上实行奴隶制。而这项禁止在新领土上实行奴隶制的企图遭到了参议院南方人的反对，并没有生效。

当战争最终结束，加利福尼亚试图以自由州身份加入联邦时，这在南方引起了轩然大波，因为它将打破南北方的力量平衡，使北方占据优势。最终，这个问题通过1850年妥协案解决，其中：第一，加利福尼亚州以自由州身份加入联邦，使自由州在国会中拥有更大的权力；第二，在华盛顿特区禁止奴隶贸易；第三，其余领土的奴隶制问题将通过人民主权原则决定，即该领土的人民将投票决定是否允许奴隶制；第四部分是一项严格的新《逃亡奴隶法》。因此，妥协暂时平息了战后地区的紧张局势。

然而，在1850年代，对领土扩张的挑战变得越来越普遍。例如，一群南方人炮制了《奥斯坦德宣言》，这是南方人从西班牙购买古巴并将其变成蓄奴州的秘密计划。它遭到了国会自由土壤派和许多北方人的反对，皮尔斯总统不得不放弃这个想法。即使是像加兹登购地这样简单的事情——1853年从墨西哥购买西南部土地用于修建铁路（今天的美国新墨西哥州和亚利桑那州）——也在南北方之间引发了一些争议。

而旨在就奴隶制问题达成的妥协最终未能缓解紧张局势。这方面的一个例子可以在1850年妥协案中看到。《逃亡奴隶法》在北方引起了巨大的争议，因为北方人突然不得不处理自己后院的奴隶制问题。他们抵制《逃亡奴隶法》的执行，这激怒了南方人，例如他们通过了个人自由法，不允许使用当地监狱关押逃亡奴隶。成立了警戒委员会，其目的是保护逃亡奴隶免受联邦奴隶法警的侵害。

你们看到，1854年，当斯蒂芬·道格拉斯提出《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》时，一场巨大的风暴爆发了。根据《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》，堪萨斯州和内布拉斯加州的奴隶制问题将基于人民主权原则决定。最终，这项法案——斯蒂芬·道格拉斯的这项提议——通过可能在北纬36°30′线以北开放奴隶制，废除了1820年的《密苏里妥协案》。北方许多人，包括一些民主党人，都反对这项法案。它在国会获得通过，但存在巨大的反对意见，共和党成立了，而辉格党最终因是否支持《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》的分歧而消失。因为北方人认为，这为南方提供了一个将奴隶制扩张到以前被禁止的地区的机会。

事实上，在整个1850年代，由于《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》，你们将看到地区紧张局势加剧。出现了所谓的“流血的堪萨斯”，支持奴隶制和反对奴隶制的势力在堪萨斯地区进行了一场小型内战。你们看到了劳伦斯城被劫掠等事件，支持奴隶制的人袭击了劳伦斯镇的自由土壤派；波塔瓦托米溪事件，约翰·布朗和他的追随者用刀砍死了支持奴隶制的人；该地区存在两个对立的政府——托皮卡的自由土壤政府和利康普顿的支持奴隶制政府。人民主权彻底失败了。

事实上，堪萨斯的暴力蔓延到了国会大厦，北方共和党人查尔斯·萨姆纳遭到南方人普雷斯顿·布鲁克斯的残酷殴打。另一场巨大的风暴在《德雷德·斯科特诉桑福德案》中再次爆发，1857年，你们在上面看到的最高法院大法官罗杰·托尼在德雷德·斯科特案中做出裁决——你们在那里看到了德雷德·斯科特——他裁决了几件事：第一，非裔美国人不是公民；第二，奴隶是财产，因此根据第五修正案，未经正当程序不得剥夺；最终，《德雷德·斯科特判决》表明国会不能禁止在各领土上实行奴隶制。因此，《密苏里妥协案》违宪，因此奴隶制有可能在全国任何地方开放。这在北方引起了轩然大波。

事实上，你们将一次又一次地看到妥协的破裂。1859年，另一场危机再次冲击联邦，约翰·布朗——波塔瓦托米溪事件的那个人——希望通过占领弗吉尼亚州哈珀斯费里的联邦军械库来引发奴隶起义。最终他失败并被绞死，但南方对此感到愤怒，这是导致脱离联邦的直接原因之一，因为南方人认为北方支持约翰·布朗这个人。

事实上，关键时刻发生在1860年，林肯——在南方没有赢得任何一个州——当选总统。对于南方人来说，他被视为一位地区性的总统，这是南北关系的一个关键转折点，并将迫使七个州在他上任之前脱离联邦。

你们在此期间看到的另一件事是第二政党制度的终结。辉格党和一无所知党——那个本土主义政党——因围绕《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》的分歧而瓦解。一个新的政党——共和党——成立了，这确实是一个地区性政党，因为它只在北方有支持。他们最初的整个纲领都反对《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》，并且反对在各领土上扩张奴隶制。随着“流血的堪萨斯”和《德雷德·斯科特案》等事件将北方的人们带入共和党，他们在1850年代的人数将不断增加。

最终，在1860年的选举中，共和党的纲领是不在各领土上扩张奴隶制。他们采纳了自由土壤纲领。随着林肯的当选，你们看到了分裂的原因——直接原因，因为对于南方人来说，林肯的当选被视为一个对奴隶制怀有敌意的北方地区性总统的当选。

在研究这段时期时，你们还应该记住，北方和南方继续彼此独立发展，地区主义因地区经济变化、人口变化和文化差异而加剧。让我为你们分解一下。

在经济上，北方以制造业和自由劳动力为基础进行工业化。他们的人口现实与南方截然不同。他们的人口增长迅速，移民数量巨大——我们在关键概念5.1中看到了这一点，爱尔兰和德国移民涌入。正如一无所知党所反映的那样，本土主义兴起，但北方的人口增长巨大。这种本土主义将是反天主教的，我们已经对此进行了一些探讨。但最终，北方在文化上与南方不同。废奴主义者——尽管在北方是少数派——但在1840年代和1850年代，他们的人数将不断增长。

对于南方人来说，他们的经济截然不同。它建立在农业种植园经济和奴隶劳动的基础上。记住，只有25%的南方人实际拥有奴隶，但奴隶制是南方生活方式的关键组成部分。南方的人口结构不利——他们的人口增长缓慢，几乎没有移民涌入。结果，你们在南方看到了一个非常不那么多样化的社会。在文化上，他们将越来越寻求捍卫奴隶制和南方生活方式。你们一次又一次地看到这一点，尤其是在1830年代和1840年代，南方人越来越将奴隶制辩护为一种积极的善。

乔治·菲茨休和约翰·C·卡尔霍恩是这方面的两个很好的例子，他们实际上是亲奴隶制论点的奠基人。他们将奴隶视为家庭成员——家庭的一份子——而不是像你们在政治漫画中看到的那样，北方可怜的工人会发生什么——他们被送进了贫民习，而奴隶则作为家庭成员受到照顾。他们认为奴隶制比北方的工资奴隶制更好，他们谈到这种奴隶使低等人文明化的思想——它使低等人文明化。这是他们为奴隶制辩护的核心论点。

你们还在滑稽剧表演中看到了著名的种族刻板印象，白人演员经常涂黑脸，以非常刻板的种族主义方式表演。你们可以真正看到奴隶制问题有多么具有争议性，以及他们如何试图通过“禁言议案”来避免讨论它，你们知道，从1836年到1844年，国会禁止讨论反奴隶制请愿书。最终，它将于1844年被约翰·昆西·亚当斯推翻。

然而，与联邦的紧张关系将加剧。南方人尤其强调州权和废止权的思想，即各州可以否决或废除联邦法律。这并非南方独有，但讨论得越来越频繁。我们在1798年的《肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议》中看到了这一点，杰斐逊和麦迪逊在其中表示他们可以无视《外国人与煽动叛乱法案》。我们在1828年“可憎关税”中看到了这一点，当时南卡罗来纳州试图废止该关税。如果你们点击那里，可以更多地了解那场危机。

但发生的情况是，1840年代和1850年代的南方人越来越频繁地谈论州权、脱离联邦和废止权。在北方，存在着日益壮大的废奴运动，你们应该了解并知道他们不同的策略。尽管如此，在1840年代和1850年代，废奴主义者在北方仍然是少数派。林肯本人不是废奴主义者，他反对在各领土上扩张奴隶制。尽管这是一个少数派运动，但在1840年代和1850年代，它变得越来越直言不讳和引人注目。

你们看到了像威廉·劳埃德·加里森这样的人——他是1833年美国反奴隶制协会的创始人之一，该协会呼吁立即无偿解放奴隶，并出版反奴隶制新闻通讯，例如《解放者》。哈丽特·比彻·斯托夫人于1852年出版的《汤姆叔叔的小屋》是一部极其重要的作品，它在增加北方对废奴运动的支持方面发挥了巨大作用。“地下铁路”继续运作，帮助奴隶逃往北方——这场运动中最著名的人物是哈丽特·塔布曼。但你们也看到了暴力呼吁，在一些罕见的情况下，发生了极少数的实际暴力事件。

大卫·沃克于1829年发表了著名的《致世界有色公民的呼吁》，他在其中呼吁通过暴力起义来结束奴隶制。1831年的纳特·特纳叛乱是唯一一次在弗吉尼亚州导致白人死亡的叛乱。结果，你们看到了南方对非裔美国人流动的巨大镇压。当然，你们看到了1859年约翰·布朗的袭击，这在南方人的心中引起了巨大的恐惧，他们认为约翰·布朗得到了北方人的支持——北方人派他来摧毁他们南方的奴隶制制度。

一个重要的思想是理解北方和南方如何越来越不信任彼此。我们已经讨论过这些话题，但值得回顾一下。例如，北方对南方的不信任可以在《逃亡奴隶法》中看到——他们不喜欢这些联邦法警在北方搜寻逃跑的奴隶。《汤姆叔叔的小屋》在通常从未考虑过这个问题北方人中引发了巨大的反奴隶制情绪。《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》及其废除《密苏里妥协案》中先前达成的妥协，在北方人中引起了对南方的大量不信任。利康普顿的欺诈性政府，他们看到来自密苏里的亲奴隶制人士越过边境——这引起了不信任。《奥斯坦德宣言》似乎表明南方人甚至在国外寻求新的领土来扩张他们所谓的奴隶制。萨姆纳流血事件，萨姆纳殴打了一位北方代表查尔斯·萨姆纳。《德雷德·斯科特案》中，一个主要由南方人组成的法院做出了关于国会是否有权在任何地方禁止奴隶制的具有巨大后果的裁决。

对于南方人来说，他们也不信任北方。他们认为北方正在攻击他们的南方生活方式。他们将《威尔莫特但书》视为试图蚕食他们在美墨战争中赢得的任何领土上的奴隶制的企图。北方对《逃亡奴隶法》的抵制被视为北方对南方生活方式的敌意。废奴运动的兴起威胁了南方人——尽管它仍然是一个少数派运动，但他们以捍卫奴隶制来回应它。以及他们认为北方支持像约翰·布朗这样的人以及哈珀斯费里事件。最终，1860年，一个地区性的共和党候选人林肯在自由土壤纲领上当选，所有这些都将创造出妥协不再可能，信任降至历史最低点的条件。

在关键概念5.3中，我们将探讨在林肯当选后不久开始的内战。如果你们点击那个粉红色的帽子，一旦我们上传了那个视频，你们将被发送到那个视频。一如既往，感谢观看。如果你们还没有订阅乔氏制作频道，请订阅。告诉你们的朋友、老师、奶奶、爷爷、表亲，并继续观看更多视频——我们一直在制作视频。请继续点击那个“喜欢”按钮。下次再见，再见！

What up APUSH people? Today we're going to take a look at APUSH period 5 key concept 5.2, and we have a bunch of key things you need to keep in mind for this key concept. It's huge. The North and the South will continue to develop into two distinct societies that will have difficulty trusting one another. The idea of manifest destiny and the movement West will once again bring up the divisive issue of slavery in the territories. Sectionalism will increasingly become a problem in the 1840s and 1850s, and this thing's going to end in a civil war. And efforts at compromise will ultimately fail to decrease sectional tension.

And so where we last left off in 5.1 was a whole lot of territorial expansion taking place -- this idea of manifest destiny. We had Oregon enter the Union with the treaty in 1846 thanks to James K. Polk. Texas was annexed in 1845 creating beef with Mexico, and of course ultimately the Mexican-American War beginning in 1846 -- controversial war. Whigs in the north were against it, and Mexico ultimately loses about half of its territory, and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 gives the United States a huge chunk of land -- about half of Mexico. And many people including Polk were very excited about this huge expansion of American territory.

However, new territories were brought into the Union which forced the issue of slavery into the center of national politics. And throughout the 1840s and 1850s, you're going to see a tremendous rise in sectional tension between the North and the South. And conflict was caused by territorial expansion -- for instance, the impact of the Mexican-American War. In fact, as soon as the war began, Northerners tried to pass the Wilmot Proviso which would have banned slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. And this attempt to ban slavery in this new territory was rejected by Southerners in the Senate, and it doesn't go into effect.

When the war is finally over and California attempts to enter the Union as a free state, this causes a whole outcry from the South because it would tip the balance in favor of the North. And ultimately that was solved by the Compromise of 1850 where: one, California was entered into the Union as a free state giving the free states more power in Congress; two, no slave trade in Washington D.C.; three, the issue of slavery in the rest of the territory would be decided by the idea of popular sovereignty where the people in that territory would vote on whether or not to allow slavery; and the fourth piece is a strict new Fugitive Slave Law. So compromise was able to calm sectional tensions following the war temporarily.

However, in the 1850s, challenges to territorial expansion became increasingly common. For instance, when a group of Southerners created the Ostend Manifesto which was a secret plan by Southerners to buy Cuba from Spain and turn it into slave states. It was opposed by free soilers in Congress and many Northerners, and President Pierce had to back down on this idea. Even something as simple as the Gadsden Purchase -- which land was purchased in the Southwest from Mexico in 1853 for the building of a railroad (present day New Mexico and Arizona) -- that provoked a little bit of controversy as well between North and South.

And attempts at compromise over slavery ultimately fail to reduce tensions. An example of this can be seen with the Compromise of 1850. The Fugitive Slave Act really provokes a huge controversy in the North because Northerners suddenly now have to deal with the issue of slavery right in their own backyard. And they resist the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act which angers Southerners with things such as personal liberty laws where they did not allow the use of local jails for housing fugitive slaves. Vigilance committees were created with the goal of protecting fugitive slaves from the federal slave marshals.

And what you see is a huge firestorm erupting in 1854 when Stephen Douglas introduces the Kansas-Nebraska Act. And under the Kansas-Nebraska Act, slavery would be decided in the territories of Kansas and Nebraska based on the idea of popular sovereignty. And ultimately this act -- this proposal by Stephen Douglas -- repeals the Missouri Compromise of 1820 by potentially opening up slavery north of the 36°30' line. And many people in the North including Democrats in some cases oppose this act. It is passed in Congress but there's a huge opposition, and the Republican Party is formed, and the Whig Party ultimately disappears over the division whether or not to support the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Because for Northerners, this is seen as giving the South an opportunity to expand slavery into an area it was previously closed off to.

In fact, throughout the 1850s, you're going to see sectional tension increasing as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. You get something called Bleeding Kansas where pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces engage in a mini Civil War in the territory of Kansas. And you get events like the sack of Lawrence where pro-slavery supporters attack free soilers in the town of Lawrence; Pottawatomie Creek where John Brown and his followers hacked to death pro-slavery supporters; and you have two rival governments in the territory -- Topeka the Free Soil government and Lecompton the pro-slavery government in Kansas. Popular sovereignty was an utter failure.

In fact, the violence of Kansas spread to the halls of Congress when Northern Republican Charles Sumner was brutally beaten by a Southerner Preston Brooks. The big kind of firestorm erupts again with Dred Scott v. Sandford where in 1857 Roger Taney the Supreme Court Justice you see at the top rules in the Dred Scott case -- Dred Scott you see right there -- and he rules a couple of things: one, African-Americans are not citizens; two, slaves are property and therefore under the Fifth Amendment cannot be taken away without due process; and ultimately what the Dred Scott decision says is Congress could not ban slavery from the territories. So therefore the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, and therefore slavery potentially could be opened up anywhere in the nation. And this creates a huge outcry from the North.

In fact, over and over again you're going to see the breakdown of compromise. Once again in 1859, another crisis hits the Union when John Brown -- the guy from Pottawatomie Creek -- hopes to spark a slave revolt in Virginia by seizing the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry. Ultimately he fails and is hung, but the South is outraged and it is one of the immediate causes of secession because Southerners feel the North is supporting this man John Brown.

In fact, the big kind of key moment happens in 1860 where Lincoln -- not winning a single state in the South -- is elected president. And for Southerners, he is seen as a sectional president, and this is a key turning point in the relationship between the North and South and will compel seven states to leave the Union before he even takes office.

And one of the other things you see happening in this period is the end of the second party system. The Whig Party and the Know-Nothing Party -- that nativist party -- collapse over the division surrounding the Kansas-Nebraska Act. You get the formation of a new party -- the Republican Party -- which is truly a sectional party in that it only has support in the North. And their whole platform in the beginning is opposed to Kansas-Nebraska Act and they're opposed to the expansion of slavery in the territories. And they're going to increasingly grow in numbers throughout the 1850s as events such as Bleeding Kansas and the Dred Scott case bring people to the Republican Party in the North.

And ultimately with the election of 1860, the Republican Party their platform was no extension of slavery in the territories. They adopt a Free Soil platform. And with Lincoln's election, you get the cause -- the immediate cause of secession because for Southerners, the election of Lincoln was seen as the election of a sectional Northern president hostile to slavery.

And one of the other things you should keep in mind when studying this time is the North and the South continue to develop distinct from one another, and sectionalism increases as a result of regional economic changes, demographic changes, and cultural differences. So let me break that down for you.

Economically, the North was industrializing based upon manufacturing, free labor. Their demographic reality was very different than the South. They had a large population growth, a huge amount of immigration -- we saw that in key concept 5.1 with the Irish and the German immigrants coming in. There is a rise of nativism as seen in the Know-Nothing Party, but there's this huge population growth in the North. This nativism is going to be anti-Catholic, and we explored that a little bit already. But ultimately culturally the North is different than the South. And abolitionists -- although a small minority in the North -- they are going to be growing in the 1840s and 1850s.

And for Southerners, their economy is very different. It's based upon agricultural plantation economy and slave labor. Now keep in mind only 25% of Southerners actually own slaves, but slavery is a key part of the Southern way of life. Demographics are not favorable for the South -- they have slow population growth, little to no immigrants coming in. And as a result, you have a very not a very diverse society in the South. And culturally they are going to increasingly seek to defend the institution of slavery and the Southern way of life. And you see that over and over again especially in the 1830s and 1840s where Southerners are increasingly defending slavery as a positive good.

Two great examples of this is George Fitzhugh and John C. Calhoun who are really kind of the developers of a pro-slavery argument. And they talk about slaves as family -- as members of the family -- as opposed to you see in the political cartoon what happens to the poor workers in the North -- they get carted off to the poor house while slaves are cared for as a member of the family. They talk about slavery as better than wage slavery in the North, and they talk about this kind of idea that slaves are civilized -- it is civilizing inferior people. And this is the kind of core part of their argument to justify the institution of slavery.

You also see racial stereotyping famously in the minstrel shows where very often white actors would paint themselves in blackface and act in very stereotypical racist ways. The kind of issue of slavery you can really see how controversial it was and how they tried to avoid it with the gag resolution which you know from 1836 to 1844 there was a ban on anti-slavery petitions being discussed in Congress. And eventually it will be overturned in 1844 by John Quincy Adams.

However, tensions with the Union will mount. There is an emphasis amongst Southerners especially of states' rights and this idea of nullification where states could void or nullify a federal law. And this was not unique necessarily to the South, but it became increasingly discussed. We saw this during the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 where Jefferson and Madison said that they could ignore the Alien and Sedition Acts. We saw this in 1828 with the Tariff of Abominations when South Carolina sought to nullify the tariff. And if you click that you can learn a little bit more about that crisis.

But what happens is the Southerners in the 1840s and 1850s are talking about states' rights, secession, and nullification more and more frequently. In the North, there is a growing abolitionist movement that you should be aware about and know their different tactics and strategies. Even though that's the case, in the 1840s and 1850s abolitionists remained a minority in the North. Lincoln himself was not an abolitionist, and he was against the extension of slavery in the territories. Although it is a minority movement, it's becoming an increasingly vocal and visible in the '40s and '50s.

You get individuals like William Lloyd Garrison -- one of the founders of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833 which calls for immediate uncompensated emancipation and publishes anti-slavery newsletters such as The Liberator. Uncle Tom's Cabin is a hugely important piece of work by Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1852, and it has a huge role in increasing support for the abolitionist movement in the North. The Underground Railroad continues to operate helping slaves escape to the North -- the most famous kind of person in this movement Harriet Tubman. But you also get calls for violence, and you get in some rare cases very few examples of actual outbreaks of violence.

David Walker famously in 1829 had the Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World where he called for a violent uprising to end slavery. Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831 was the only rebellion that actually led to the death of white people in Virginia. And as a result, you have this huge crackdown on the movement of African-Americans throughout the South. And of course, you have John Brown's raid in 1859 which strikes a huge amount of fear in the minds of Southerners, and they perceive John Brown as supported by Northerners -- sent by Northerners to undo their Southern institution of slavery.

And a big idea is to understand how the North and the South increasingly distrusted one another. And we've already kind of covered these topics, but it's worth reviewing. For instance, the Northern distrust of the South can be seen in the Fugitive Slave Act -- they didn't like these federal marshals running through the North looking for runaway slaves. Uncle Tom's Cabin provoked a huge anti-slavery sentiment amongst Northerners who normally never thought about the issue. The events of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the repeal of previous compromise in the Missouri Compromise caused a lot of distrust amongst Northerners towards the South. The fraudulent government of Lecompton where they were seeing pro-slavery people from Missouri crossing the border -- that caused distrust. The Ostend Manifesto where it seemed like Southerners were seeking new territory even abroad to expand their slavocracy as they called it. The events of Bleeding Sumner where Sumner had beat one of the Northern representatives Charles Sumner. And Dred Scott where a predominantly Southern court made a decision with huge consequences about Congress's ability or inability to ban slavery anywhere.

For Southerners, they also had a distrust of the North. For them, they felt the North was attacking their Southern way of life. They saw the Wilmot Proviso as an attempt to try to chip away at slavery in any territory that they had won in the Mexican-American War. The Northern resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act was seen as Northern hostility to the Southern way of life. The growth of the abolitionist movement threatened Southerners -- even though it remained a minority movement, they reacted to it with their own defense of slavery. And the perceived Northern support for people like John Brown and the events at Harper's Ferry. And ultimately the election in 1860 of a sectional Republican Party candidate Lincoln on a Free Soil platform are all going to create the conditions where compromise was no longer possible and trust was at an all-time low.
