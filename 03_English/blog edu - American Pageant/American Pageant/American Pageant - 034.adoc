== 释义

Good morning, good afternoon, whatever time of the day it is, thank you for checking out the video 观看视频. Today we're breaking down 详细分析 World War 2. If you're studying this topic for APUSH or regular US History, this video is going to help you out.

Now remember, on December 7th, 1941, all of that isolationist sentiment 孤立主义情绪 goes out the window 化为乌有 with the attack on Pearl Harbor 珍珠港袭击. It effectively ends the isolationist movement 孤立主义运动. December 8th, Congress 国会 declares war 宣战. Three days later, Germany and Italy declare war against the United States. And what you see is the US had already begun mobilizing 动员；调动 for war even before this attack on December 7th. For example, we had the Selective Service Act 选征兵役法 -- the first peacetime draft 和平时期征兵. We had Lend-Lease supplies 租借法案物资 being produced for the allies 同盟国. And as a result of this, many US factories had already shifted to war production 转向战时生产.

Once we enter the war, we are now a member of the Allies 同盟国 -- The Big Three 三巨头: England, the Soviet Union 苏联 and the United States. But don't forget there are many other countries fighting along for the Allied cause 同盟事业. It's important to note that the role of the Federal Government 联邦政府 is going to expand 扩大. In fact, it expanded greater than it had during the New Deal 新政 or World War I. This is a mass mobilization 大规模动员 to fight this war.

World War II brought about 导致 a huge mobilization on the home front 国内战线. This is a mass mobilization, and really it's going to be industrial production 工业生产 of the United States that is going to be a key factor 关键因素 for the Allied Victory 同盟国胜利. And of course, as a result of this mass mobilization, the smiley face comes out -- the Great Depression 大萧条 ends. And you could see the unemployment rate 失业率 dropped even before Pearl Harbor, but it only continues to drop throughout the war.

Now what do we mean by mass mobilization? Well, the federal government is going to play a key role. For example, you have -- just like during World War I -- different agencies 机构. The War Production Board 战时生产委员会 allocated resources 调配资源 for the war effort 战争行动, making sure that we go from consumer production 消费品生产 to war production. The Office of Price Administration 物价管理办公室 froze prices and wages 冻结物价和工资 and rationed 定量供应 certain goods such as meat, gas, sugar and so on, so that there would be enough material for the war effort. Citizens received ration books 配给簿 for things like gasoline and needed stamps 配给券 in order to purchase certain scarce items 稀缺物品. A black market 黑市 did develop for certain goods, but the OPA tried to do its best.

We've already said this, but it's important to repeat: America's industrial output 工业产出 was a huge factor in the eventual Allied Victory. US factories are supplying these weapons for most of the Allies. Another government agency that's important to know about is the Office of Research and Development 研究与发展办公室. And what this federal agency did is it contracted with 与……签订合同 scientists and universities to help develop technology for the war effort. So developments in sonar 声呐, radar 雷达, rockets 火箭 and other things -- technological advances 技术进步 are going to be hugely important once again to the Allied Victory.

And of course the big one is the Manhattan Project 曼哈顿计划 which begins in 1942. You can see its locations on that map there all across the United States. This was a joint secret program 联合秘密计划 between the United States and England. They kept the Soviets out of it 不让苏联参与 even though they knew because of spying 间谍活动. And it's headed by 由……领导 J. Robert Oppenheimer 罗伯特·奥本海默. And at the height of 在……巅峰时期 the Manhattan Project -- the secret program -- 100,000 people worked for it and they're going to spend $2 billion. And in July of 1945, the first atomic bomb 原子弹 will be successfully detonated 引爆 in the desert of New Mexico 新墨西哥州沙漠.

Another key thing to know about when we study World War II is the social impacts 社会影响 of the war. The war is going to present numerous opportunities 带来众多机会 for women and various minority groups 少数群体 living in the United States. They are going to be able to improve their socioeconomic position 社会经济地位 as a result of World War II.

Couple of examples 几个例子: for African-Americans, you're going to have a Second Great Migration 第二次大迁徙 where over a million African-Americans are going to leave the South 南方 searching for jobs in war industries 战时工业. And we're really going to see this growth -- or this movement of people -- to Northern cities 北方城市 but also on the west coast 在西海岸 in places like California. Unfortunately, discrimination 歧视 was extremely common in defense work 国防工作. Very often African-Americans had a limit to the number and the size of the opportunities that were presented even by World War II.

In fact, race riots 种族骚乱 -- once again just as we saw during World War I -- are going to break out 爆发. In 1943 you have race riots breaking out in cities like Detroit 底特律 and New York. So racial tension 种族紧张局势 accompanies 伴随 these opportunities as well. A. Philip Randolph 菲利普·兰道夫 is an important individual you should know. He actually threatened 威胁 the administration of Franklin Roosevelt to march on Washington DC 向华盛顿进军 if discrimination in defense work was not addressed 解决 by the Roosevelt administration.

An important milestone 里程碑 is reached when Executive Order 8802 第8802号行政命令 is finally issued 发布 by Franklin Roosevelt to avoid this march. And this is the first federal action 联邦行动 to promote equal opportunity 促进机会平等 and to prohibit employment discrimination 禁止就业歧视 in the US ever by the federal government. Nearly a million African-Americans are going to serve in this war against the fascist 法西斯主义者 and the Nazi parties 纳粹党. But even though we're fighting for these ideals 理想 like democracy 民主, it's important to keep in mind African-Americans are serving in segregated units 隔离部队.

But you do have some progress 进展. You have people like the Tuskegee Airmen 塔斯基吉飞行员 -- the first African-American pilots 非裔美国飞行员 in the US Army 美国陆军. With these opportunities comes new demands 新要求 from the civil rights movement 民权运动. In fact, the Double Victory campaign 双重胜利运动 was pursued during the war. And what it was is calling for not only a victory against fascism abroad 国外的法西斯主义, but civil rights leaders were calling for a victory against racism at home 国内的种族主义. And what you see during World War II is the membership in the NAACP 全国有色人种协进会 dramatically increases 大幅增加 as more and more people are putting demands on greater justice in America. And you get new organizations such as CORE -- the Congress of Racial Equality 种族平等大会 -- which was formed in 1942 to fight against discrimination 反对歧视.

So make sure you know that World War II has consequences 影响 on the home front for various social groups 社会群体. Two other groups that you should know about is the impact of the war on Mexican-Americans 墨西哥裔美国人 and Native Americans 美国原住民. Don't forget during the Great Depression there was this repatriation 遣返 where Mexican Americans and Mexican people of Mexican descent 墨西哥血统 were forced out of the United States. But during the war there was a demand for workers in the defense industry 国防工业, and this provided opportunities to thousands of Mexican-Americans getting jobs in these defense plants 国防工厂.

Not only that, a program is introduced in 1942 called the Bracero Program 布拉塞罗计划. And this allowed Mexican farm workers 墨西哥农场工人 to come into the United States to work without going through the formal immigration proceedings 正式移民程序. So during World War II you have the federal government asking for and allowing Mexican immigrants 墨西哥移民 to come into the United States to help out with the labor shortage 劳动力短缺. Of course, as in all of these scenarios 情况, usually racial tensions increase during these times as well. And racial tensions between white soldiers -- especially naval officials 海军官员 -- and Mexican residents in Los Angeles 洛杉矶 lead to the horrible Zoot Suit Riots 佐特套服骚乱 in 1943, where hundreds of Mexican-American youth 墨西哥裔美国青年 wearing the zoot suit 佐特套服 are beat up 殴打 and arrested by military officials 军事官员 and the LAPD 洛杉矶警察局.

Native Americans have different responses and opportunities to World War II as well. They received opportunities just as many other groups in defense work and in the military 军队. In fact, the Navajo Code Talkers 纳瓦霍密码译员 are a key part of this story. They are Navajo Native American men 纳瓦霍族美国原住民 who volunteer 自愿 serving their country -- the United States -- and they use their native Navajo language 纳瓦霍语 to communicate in the war against Japan 与日本作战. And they use these Navajo words to help out communication during the war against Japan and play a very important role in the fighting. And one of the things that happens with Native Americans is after the war is over, a lot of the native people who left the reservation 保留地 to work in war industries or to fight -- about half will not return to life on the reservation.

And finally, you also have social and demographic changes 社会和人口变化 besides ethnic and racial 除了种族方面的. And one important one to know about is the role of women during World War II. Over 200,000 women served in the military 在军队服役 in non-combat roles 非战斗岗位, but they're serving nonetheless in the US Armed Forces 美国武装部队. They were not allowed to serve in combat 参加战斗 during the war. And the big impact is this: as the demand for industrial and defense jobs increased, nearly 5 million women entered the workforce 进入劳动力市场 during World War II. Many of these women are working in the shipyards 造船厂 and the defense plants 国防工厂. They are women who in many cases never worked before. Many of them are married and their husbands are off overseas fighting. And they play a key role. And the symbol of this is Rosie the Riveter 女工人罗西（战时女性工人的象征）.

In spite of these opportunities, women continue to receive lower pay than men 比男性工资低 and were expected to leave once the war was over. They were considered substitutes 替代品, not replacements 取代者. And another key thing regardless of race or gender 无论种族或性别 is you're going to have huge demographic changes 人口变化 occur as many, many people head to the Midwest 中西部 and also the West Coast 西海岸 looking for defense jobs. It's not just African-American individuals moving but large migrations of people 大规模人口迁移. In fact, following World War II you're going to have a post-war migration 战后迁移 to the Sun Belt 阳光地带. Southern states 南方各州 are going to see huge numbers of people going to them and also the west coast to places like California. The warm weather, the lower labor cost 劳动力成本 and the presence of defense factories 国防工厂 are going to have this huge population pool 人口涌入 to these regions.

Now it's going to be the Japanese American community 日裔美国人社区 in which World War II is going to have the biggest impact. And you're going to see the complete denial of civil liberties 公民自由被完全剥夺. Now don't forget there was already a lot of anti-Asian sentiment 反亚裔情绪 in the United States -- nativism 本土主义 towards groups whether they be Japanese or Chinese. The bombing of Pearl Harbor only accelerates 加剧 and increases that. In fact, following the bombing on December 7th, Executive Order 9066 第9066号行政命令 is passed by the US government which requires that all people of Japanese descent 日裔 on the west coast be relocated to internment camps 拘留营. It did not matter that many of these individuals were Nisei 二代日裔 -- second generation Japanese Americans 第二代日裔美国人. They are American citizens 美国公民. They own businesses 拥有企业. They went to US public schools 美国公立学校. It was completely disregarded 忽视 because there was this feeling that perhaps these individuals were going to be potential spies 潜在间谍 for the government of Japan.

Now keep in mind there is no evidence of any wrongdoing 不当行为 of any of these individuals. And over 100,000 Japanese Americans and people of Japanese descent were relocated to one of 10 internment camps 拘留营 throughout the country. Interesting to know is the large Japanese population in Hawaii 夏威夷 -- where Pearl Harbor actually was and where the attack took place -- they were not evacuated 撤离 because it would have devastated the economy of Hawaii 摧毁夏威夷经济. Japanese laborers 日本劳工 were the key group in that region.

There is an important lawsuit 诉讼 that you need to know: Korematsu versus the United States 是松诉美国案. It goes all the way to the Supreme Court 最高法院. There is Fred Korematsu 弗雷德·是松 right there. And the Supreme Court upheld 维持 the relocation as necessary for national security 国家安全所需. And by now you should realize that during times of national security threats or perceived threats 感知到的威胁 -- especially wars -- individual civil liberties go down 下降 and are often times violated 侵犯. And another thing to keep in mind is thousands of Japanese Americans -- many with their families in one of these camps -- fought bravely for the United States. And there's a great quote by Harry Truman 哈里·杜鲁门 recognizing that bravery: "You fought not only the enemy, you fought prejudice at home and won."

Now you don't need to know a whole lot about the fighting of World War II -- even though it's really exciting stuff -- but a couple of key things here to get you ready for your exam. The Allies are going to focus first on the European theater of the war 欧洲战场. In fact, that was the focus following Pearl Harbor even though it was Japan who attacked us.

And a couple of key moments 关键时刻 that you should know about: the Soviets finally stopped the German advance 推进 at Stalingrad 斯大林格勒 and start pushing the Nazi army 纳粹军队 out of the Soviet Union. The Allies -- England and the US especially -- focus first on North Africa 北非 and into Italy as their strategy 战略. And eventually you're going to have the second front 第二战场 which is going to take place on June 6, 1944 -- the famous D-Day invasion 诺曼底登陆.

Now if it was industrial production of the United States that's going to play a key role in the victory, it's also going to be Allied military and political cooperation 军事和政治合作 that's going to be another key factor. In fact, during the war, The Big Three -- Roosevelt, Churchill 丘吉尔 and Stalin 斯大林 -- are going to meet numerous times to discuss military strategy 军事战略 and also to plan for the post-war world 战后世界.

Couple of these conferences 会议 you should know about: the first one is in January of 1943, and this is the first time that Roosevelt and Churchill meet once we are in the war. Remember they had previously met at the Atlantic Conference 大西洋会议. Now they're meeting during the war, and they decide on a couple of things -- Stalin's not there. One, the war is going to be only finished with unconditional surrender 无条件投降 of the Axis powers 轴心国. And they choose that they're going to invade Sicily 西西里岛 and Italy first -- which makes Stalin not too happy because he wanted relief for the Soviet Red Army 苏联红军 from the German invasion.

Another conference to keep in mind is the Tehran Conference 德黑兰会议. This is the first time the Big Three meet. There you see all three of them there in November of 1943. They decide a couple of things: one, they start planning the opening of the second front 第二战场的开辟 that Stalin really wanted to relieve the Soviet Army once again. And that's going to be eventually the D-Day invasion. And they also talk about the fate of Eastern Europe 东欧的命运. And this is going to be a key thing in the post-war world. Stalin wants to control Eastern Europe. He wants to divide up Germany 分割德国. Churchill and Roosevelt want a free Eastern Europe. Conflict developing, but they tried to avoid it so they could focus on winning the war.

And the big one happens in 1945 -- the Yalta Conference 雅尔塔会议. Germany, it is decided, will be divided into four zones 四个占领区. And both Churchill and Roosevelt feel they got Stalin to agree that there are going to be free elections 自由选举 in Eastern Europe. The third important thing to keep in mind -- and this one's key -- is the Soviets promised they will help out the US against Japan 3 months after the war in Europe is over. And then finally they also agree to create a new international organization -- the United Nations 联合国.

Eventually both Mussolini 墨索里尼 and Hitler 希特勒 are defeated, and the United States then is able to turn its attention on the war against Japan 转而关注对日战争. Important to keep in mind: it was largely the US military responsible for the fight against Japan during the early periods of the war 战争初期主要由美军负责对日作战. And if you look at this map following Pearl Harbor, Japan was really kicking some butt 进展顺利. They occupied all the territory in the orange 橙色区域 -- the Philippines 菲律宾, Indonesia 印度尼西亚 and much of Asia.

The strategy of the United States in this early period is called island hopping 跳岛战术. Basically the goal is really simple: you strategically win control over territory 有策略地控制领土 to get closer to mainland Japan 日本本土. And the idea is you skip certain islands that Japan occupied, and eventually the US military would get close enough where they could start aerial bombing 空袭 of Japan.

In July of 1945 at the Potsdam Conference 波茨坦会议, you have another meeting. By this point the war in Europe is over. Roosevelt has unfortunately passed away 去世, and Truman -- the new president -- is meeting with Joseph Stalin. And they agree on one very important thing that you need to know about: they said Japan you need to surrender unconditionally 无条件投降 or you will be destroyed.

While at the Potsdam Conference, Truman is informed that the Manhattan Project had successfully detonated the first atomic bomb. And on August 6th, 1945, the first atomic bomb 原子弹 was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima 广岛 as planned and as promised at the Yalta conference 雅尔塔会议. On August 8th, the Soviet Union enters the war against Japan -- 3 months after Germany had surrendered. And the next day on August 9th, the second atomic bomb is dropped on Japan at Nagasaki 长崎. Shortly thereafter, Japan does surrender 投降 and World War II ends.

The dropping of these two atomic bombs is not without controversy 争议, and it's important you understand the different arguments for and against the dropping of the bombs. But key idea here: following World War II, the US will be the dominant political and military country 主导的政治和军事强国 in the world. Although we were isolationists 孤立主义者 when World War II began, at the end of World War II the United States is going to play a key role in the international community 国际社会.

早上好，下午好，无论现在是什么时间，感谢观看本视频。今天我们要详细讲解第二次世界大战。如果你正在为APUSH或常规美国历史学习这个主题，这个视频将对你有所帮助。

记住，1941年12月7日，随着珍珠港事件的爆发，所有孤立主义情绪都烟消云散。它有效地结束了孤立主义运动。12月8日，国会宣战。三天后，德国和意大利对美国宣战。你们看到的是，早在12月7日袭击发生之前，美国就已经开始动员备战。例如，我们颁布了《选择性兵役法》——第一个和平时期的征兵法案。我们为盟国生产了租借物资。因此，许多美国工厂已经转向战时生产。

一旦我们参战，我们就成为盟军的一员——三大巨头：英国、苏联和美国。但不要忘记，还有许多其他国家为了盟军的事业并肩作战。重要的是要注意，联邦政府的作用将扩大。事实上，它的扩张程度超过了新政时期或第一次世界大战时期。这是一场为赢得战争而进行的大规模动员。

第二次世界大战在本土带来了大规模的动员。这是一场大规模的动员，实际上，美国的工业生产将成为盟军胜利的关键因素。当然，由于这场大规模的动员，经济好转——大萧条结束了。你们可以看到，甚至在珍珠港事件之前，失业率就已经下降，但在整个战争期间，失业率持续下降。

我们所说的大规模动员是什么意思呢？联邦政府将发挥关键作用。例如，就像第一次世界大战期间一样，你们有不同的机构。“战争生产委员会”为战争努力分配资源，确保我们从消费品生产转向战争物资生产。“物价管理局”冻结了物价和工资，并对某些商品（如肉类、汽油、糖等）实行配给，以便为战争努力提供足够的物资。公民收到了汽油等商品的配给证，并且需要邮票才能购买某些稀缺物品。某些商品确实出现了黑市，但物价管理局尽力而为。

我们已经说过这一点，但重要的是要重申：美国的工业产出是最终盟军胜利的一个巨大因素。美国工厂为大多数盟国提供武器。另一个需要了解的重要政府机构是“科研与发展办公室”。这个联邦机构与科学家和大学签订合同，帮助开发用于战争的技术。因此，声纳、雷达、火箭和其他技术的发展——技术进步将再次对盟军的胜利至关重要。

当然，最重要的是1942年开始的曼哈顿计划。你们可以在地图上看到它在美国各地的位置。这是美国和英国之间的一个联合秘密计划。他们甚至对苏联保密，尽管他们通过间谍活动知道苏联了解情况。该计划由J·罗伯特·奥本海默领导。在曼哈顿计划——这个秘密计划——的高峰期，有10万人为其工作，他们将花费20亿美元。1945年7月，第一颗原子弹将在新墨西哥州的沙漠中成功引爆。

当我们研究第二次世界大战时，另一个需要了解的关键是战争的社会影响。战争将为居住在美国的妇女和各个少数族裔群体带来许多机会。由于第二次世界大战，他们将能够提高其社会经济地位。

举几个例子：对于非裔美国人来说，你们将看到第二次大迁徙，超过一百万的非裔美国人将离开南方，到战争工业中寻找工作。我们将真正看到这种增长——或者说人口的流动——不仅是向北部城市，也是向西海岸的加利福尼亚等地。不幸的是，在国防工作中，歧视非常普遍。即使在第二次世界大战期间，非裔美国人所获得的机会的数量和规模往往也受到限制。

事实上，正如我们在第一次世界大战期间看到的那样，种族骚乱将再次爆发。1943年，底特律和纽约等城市爆发了种族骚乱。因此，种族紧张也伴随着这些机会。你们应该了解一位重要人物A·菲利普·伦道夫。他实际上威胁富兰克林·罗斯福政府，如果罗斯福政府不解决国防工作中的歧视问题，他将率众向华盛顿特区进军。

为了避免这次游行，富兰克林·罗斯福最终发布了第8802号行政命令，这是一个重要的里程碑。这是联邦政府有史以来首次采取行动促进平等机会并禁止就业歧视。近一百万非裔美国人将参加这场反对法西斯和纳粹党的战争。但即使我们为民主等理想而战，重要的是要记住，非裔美国人在隔离的部队中服役。

但你们确实看到了一些进步。你们有像塔斯基吉飞行员这样的人——美国陆军中第一批非裔美国飞行员。随着这些机会的出现，民权运动提出了新的要求。事实上，在战争期间开展了“双重胜利”运动。它的目标不仅是在国外战胜法西斯主义，而且民权领袖们还呼吁在国内战胜种族主义。你们在第二次世界大战期间看到，全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）的成员人数急剧增加，越来越多的人要求在美国实现更大的公正。你们还看到了新的组织成立，例如“种族平等 Congress”（CORE），该组织于1942年成立，旨在反对歧视。

因此，务必了解第二次世界大战对国内各个社会群体产生了影响。你们应该了解的另外两个群体是战争对墨西哥裔美国人和美洲原住民的影响。不要忘记在大萧条期间，存在着将墨西哥裔美国人和墨西哥裔人强行驱逐出美国的遣返行动。但在战争期间，国防工业需要工人，这为成千上万的墨西哥裔美国人在这些国防工厂找到工作提供了机会。

不仅如此，1942年还推出了一项名为“布拉塞罗计划”的计划。该计划允许墨西哥农场工人进入美国工作，而无需经过正式的移民程序。因此，在第二次世界大战期间，联邦政府要求并允许墨西哥移民进入美国，以帮助解决劳动力短缺问题。当然，与所有这些情况一样，通常在这些时期种族紧张局势也会加剧。白人士兵——尤其是海军官员——和洛杉矶的墨西哥居民之间的种族紧张关系导致了1943年可怕的“祖特服骚乱”，数百名穿着祖特服的墨西哥裔美国青年遭到军方官员和洛杉矶警察局的殴打和逮捕。

美洲原住民对第二次世界大战也有不同的反应和机会。他们像许多其他群体一样在国防工作和军队中获得了机会。事实上，“纳瓦霍密码员”是这个故事的关键部分。他们是志愿为他们的国家——美国——服务的纳瓦霍族美洲原住民男子，他们使用他们的母语纳瓦霍语在对日战争中进行通信。他们使用这些纳瓦霍语帮助在对日战争期间进行通信，并在战斗中发挥了非常重要的作用。美洲原住民发生的一件事是，战争结束后，许多离开保留地到战争工业工作或参战的原住民——大约一半不会回到保留地的生活。

最后，除了种族和民族之外，你们还会看到社会和人口结构的变化。一个需要了解的重要变化是第二次世界大战期间妇女的作用。超过20万妇女在军队中担任非战斗职务，但她们仍然在美国武装部队中服役。战争期间她们不允许参加战斗。最大的影响是：随着工业和国防工作需求的增加，在第二次世界大战期间，近500万妇女进入劳动力市场。其中许多妇女在造船厂和国防工厂工作。她们中的许多人以前从未工作过。她们中的许多人已婚，丈夫在海外作战。她们发挥了关键作用。其象征是“铆钉女工罗西”。

尽管有这些机会，妇女的工资仍然低于男性，并且在战争结束后预计会离开工作岗位。她们被认为是替代者，而不是替代品。另一个关键点，无论种族或性别如何，你们都会看到巨大的人口结构变化，因为许多人前往中西部和西海岸寻找国防工作。不仅仅是非裔美国人在迁移，而是大量人口的迁移。事实上，在第二次世界大战之后，你们将看到向阳光地带的战后移民。南部各州和西海岸（如加利福尼亚州）的人口将大幅增加。温暖的气候、较低的劳动力成本和国防工厂的存在将吸引大量人口涌入这些地区。

现在，第二次世界大战对日裔美国人社区的影响最大。你们将看到公民自由被完全剥夺。不要忘记，美国国内已经存在大量反亚洲情绪——针对日本人或中国人的本土主义。珍珠港事件的轰炸只会加速和加剧这种情况。事实上，在12月7日轰炸之后，美国政府通过了第9066号行政命令，要求西海岸所有日裔人士都必须搬迁到拘留营。许多这些人是二世——第二代日裔美国人，但这并不重要。他们是美国公民。他们拥有企业。他们就读于美国公立学校。这一切都被完全无视了，因为人们认为这些人可能是日本政府的潜在间谍。

请记住，没有任何证据表明这些人有任何不当行为。超过10万日裔美国人和日裔人士被搬迁到全国10个拘留营中的一个。有趣的是，夏威夷——珍珠港所在地和袭击发生地——的庞大日裔人口没有被疏散，因为这将摧毁夏威夷的经济。日本劳工是该地区的关键群体。

你们需要了解一个重要的诉讼案：《是松诉美国案》。该案一直上诉到最高法院。弗雷德·是松就在那里。最高法院维持了搬迁的决定，认为这对国家安全是必要的。到目前为止，你们应该认识到，在国家安全受到威胁或被认为受到威胁的时期——尤其是在战争时期——个人公民自由会减少，并且常常遭到侵犯。另一个需要记住的是，成千上万的日裔美国人——许多人的家人也在这些营地中——为美国勇敢地战斗。哈里·杜鲁门有一句伟大的引言承认了他们的勇敢：“你们不仅与敌人作战，还在国内与偏见作斗争并取得了胜利。”

现在，你们不需要了解很多关于第二次世界大战的战斗——尽管那确实很激动人心——但这里有几个关键点可以帮助你们为考试做好准备。盟军将首先专注于欧洲战场。事实上，即使是日本袭击了我们之后，珍珠港事件之后，重点仍然是欧洲战场。

你们应该了解几个关键时刻：苏联最终在斯大林格勒阻止了德国的推进，并开始将纳粹军队赶出苏联。盟军——尤其是英国和美国——首先将战略重点放在北非和意大利。最终，你们将看到第二战场将于1944年6月6日开辟——著名的诺曼底登陆。

如果说美国的工业生产将在胜利中发挥关键作用，那么盟军的军事和政治合作也将是另一个关键因素。事实上，在战争期间，三大巨头——罗斯福、丘吉尔和斯大林——将多次会面，讨论军事战略并规划战后世界。

你们应该了解其中的几次会议：第一次是在1943年1月，这是我们参战后罗斯福和丘吉尔的首次会面。记住他们之前在大西洋会议上见过面。现在他们在战争期间会面，他们决定了几件事——斯大林不在场。第一，只有轴心国无条件投降，战争才会结束。他们选择首先入侵西西里岛和意大利——这让斯大林不太高兴，因为他希望苏联红军能够从德国的入侵中得到喘息。

另一个需要记住的会议是德黑兰会议。这是三大巨头的首次会面。你们可以看到他们在1943年11月都在那里。他们决定了几件事：第一，他们开始计划开辟斯大林一直希望的第二战场，以再次减轻苏联军队的压力。这将最终导致诺曼底登陆。他们还讨论了东欧的命运。这将是战后世界的一个关键问题。斯大林想要控制东欧。他想瓜分德国。丘吉尔和罗斯福想要一个自由的东欧。冲突正在酝酿，但他们试图避免，以便专注于赢得战争。

最重要的是1945年的雅尔塔会议。决定将德国划分为四个区域。丘吉尔和罗斯福都认为他们让斯大林同意在东欧举行自由选举。第三个需要记住的重要事项——这一点至关重要——是苏联承诺将在欧洲战争结束后三个月帮助美国对抗日本。最后，他们还同意创建一个新的国际组织——联合国。

最终，墨索里尼和希特勒都被击败，美国随后能够将注意力转向对日战争。重要的是要记住：在战争初期，主要是美国军队负责对日作战。如果你们看一下珍珠港事件后的地图，日本确实占据了优势。他们占领了橙色区域的所有领土——菲律宾、印度尼西亚和亚洲大部分地区。

美国在这一早期的战略被称为“跳岛战术”。基本上，目标非常简单：你们有策略地赢得对领土的控制，以便更接近日本本土。其想法是跳过日本占领的某些岛屿，最终美国军队将足够接近，可以开始对日本进行空中轰炸。

1945年7月，在波茨坦会议上，你们看到了另一次会议。到那时，欧洲的战争已经结束。罗斯福不幸去世，新总统杜鲁门正在与约瑟夫·斯大林会面。他们就一个你们需要了解的非常重要的问题达成了一致：他们对日本说，你们必须无条件投降，否则将被摧毁。

在波茨坦会议期间，杜鲁门得知曼哈顿计划成功引爆了第一颗原子弹。1945年8月6日，正如在雅尔塔会议上计划和承诺的那样，第一颗原子弹投向了日本城市广岛。8月8日，苏联对日宣战——在德国投降三个月后。第二天，8月9日，第二颗原子弹投向了日本长崎。此后不久，日本投降，第二次世界大战结束。

这两颗原子弹的投放并非没有争议，重要的是你们要理解赞成和反对投放原子弹的不同论点。但这里的关键思想是：第二次世界大战后，美国将成为世界上占主导地位的政治和军事强国。尽管在第二次世界大战开始时我们是孤立主义者，但在第二次世界大战结束时，美国将在国际社会中发挥关键作用。

今天就到这里。如果你们还没有订阅，请务必订阅。如果这个视频对你们有帮助，请点赞并告诉你们所有的同学。我在长崎参观了一个投向长崎市的原子弹的全尺寸模型。正如你们在我这个身高6英尺5英寸的人旁边看到的那样，它确实是一个相当大的炸弹。下次再见，感谢观看。祝你们度过美好的一天。再见。

Good morning, good afternoon, whatever time of the day it is, thank you for checking out the video. Today we're breaking down World War 2. If you're studying this topic for APUSH or regular US History, this video is going to help you out.

Now remember, on December 7th, 1941, all of that isolationist sentiment goes out the window with the attack on Pearl Harbor. It effectively ends the isolationist movement. December 8th, Congress declares war. Three days later, Germany and Italy declare war against the United States. And what you see is the US had already begun mobilizing for war even before this attack on December 7th. For example, we had the Selective Service Act -- the first peacetime draft. We had Lend-Lease supplies being produced for the allies. And as a result of this, many US factories had already shifted to war production.

Once we enter the war, we are now a member of the Allies -- The Big Three: England, the Soviet Union and the United States. But don't forget there are many other countries fighting along for the Allied cause. It's important to note that the role of the Federal Government is going to expand. In fact, it expanded greater than it had during the New Deal or World War I. This is a mass mobilization to fight this war.

World War II brought about a huge mobilization on the home front. This is a mass mobilization, and really it's going to be industrial production of the United States that is going to be a key factor for the Allied Victory. And of course, as a result of this mass mobilization, the smiley face comes out -- the Great Depression ends. And you could see the unemployment rate dropped even before Pearl Harbor, but it only continues to drop throughout the war.

Now what do we mean by mass mobilization? Well, the federal government is going to play a key role. For example, you have -- just like during World War I -- different agencies. The War Production Board allocated resources for the war effort, making sure that we go from consumer production to war production. The Office of Price Administration froze prices and wages and rationed certain goods such as meat, gas, sugar and so on, so that there would be enough material for the war effort. Citizens received ration books for things like gasoline and needed stamps in order to purchase certain scarce items. A black market did develop for certain goods, but the OPA tried to do its best.

We've already said this, but it's important to repeat: America's industrial output was a huge factor in the eventual Allied Victory. US factories are supplying these weapons for most of the Allies. Another government agency that's important to know about is the Office of Research and Development. And what this federal agency did is it contracted with scientists and universities to help develop technology for the war effort. So developments in sonar, radar, rockets and other things -- technological advances are going to be hugely important once again to the Allied Victory.

And of course the big one is the Manhattan Project which begins in 1942. You can see its locations on that map there all across the United States. This was a joint secret program between the United States and England. They kept the Soviets out of it even though they knew because of spying. And it's headed by J. Robert Oppenheimer. And at the height of the Manhattan Project -- the secret program -- 100,000 people worked for it and they're going to spend $2 billion. And in July of 1945, the first atomic bomb will be successfully detonated in the desert of New Mexico.

Another key thing to know about when we study World War II is the social impacts of the war. The war is going to present numerous opportunities for women and various minority groups living in the United States. They are going to be able to improve their socioeconomic position as a result of World War II.

Couple of examples: for African-Americans, you're going to have a Second Great Migration where over a million African-Americans are going to leave the South searching for jobs in war industries. And we're really going to see this growth -- or this movement of people -- to Northern cities but also on the west coast in places like California. Unfortunately, discrimination was extremely common in defense work. Very often African-Americans had a limit to the number and the size of the opportunities that were presented even by World War II.

In fact, race riots -- once again just as we saw during World War I -- are going to break out. In 1943 you have race riots breaking out in cities like Detroit and New York. So racial tension accompanies these opportunities as well. A. Philip Randolph is an important individual you should know. He actually threatened the administration of Franklin Roosevelt to march on Washington DC if discrimination in defense work was not addressed by the Roosevelt administration.

An important milestone is reached when Executive Order 8802 is finally issued by Franklin Roosevelt to avoid this march. And this is the first federal action to promote equal opportunity and to prohibit employment discrimination in the US ever by the federal government. Nearly a million African-Americans are going to serve in this war against the fascist and the Nazi parties. But even though we're fighting for these ideals like democracy, it's important to keep in mind African-Americans are serving in segregated units.

But you do have some progress. You have people like the Tuskegee Airmen -- the first African-American pilots in the US Army. With these opportunities comes new demands from the civil rights movement. In fact, the Double Victory campaign was pursued during the war. And what it was is calling for not only a victory against fascism abroad, but civil rights leaders were calling for a victory against racism at home. And what you see during World War II is the membership in the NAACP dramatically increases as more and more people are putting demands on greater justice in America. And you get new organizations such as CORE -- the Congress of Racial Equality -- which was formed in 1942 to fight against discrimination.

So make sure you know that World War II has consequences on the home front for various social groups. Two other groups that you should know about is the impact of the war on Mexican-Americans and Native Americans. Don't forget during the Great Depression there was this repatriation where Mexican Americans and Mexican people of Mexican descent were forced out of the United States. But during the war there was a demand for workers in the defense industry, and this provided opportunities to thousands of Mexican-Americans getting jobs in these defense plants.

Not only that, a program is introduced in 1942 called the Bracero Program. And this allowed Mexican farm workers to come into the United States to work without going through the formal immigration proceedings. So during World War II you have the federal government asking for and allowing Mexican immigrants to come into the United States to help out with the labor shortage. Of course, as in all of these scenarios, usually racial tensions increase during these times as well. And racial tensions between white soldiers -- especially naval officials -- and Mexican residents in Los Angeles lead to the horrible Zoot Suit Riots in 1943, where hundreds of Mexican-American youth wearing the zoot suit are beat up and arrested by military officials and the LAPD.

Native Americans have different responses and opportunities to World War II as well. They received opportunities just as many other groups in defense work and in the military. In fact, the Navajo Code Talkers are a key part of this story. They are Navajo Native American men who volunteer serving their country -- the United States -- and they use their native Navajo language to communicate in the war against Japan. And they use these Navajo words to help out communication during the war against Japan and play a very important role in the fighting. And one of the things that happens with Native Americans is after the war is over, a lot of the native people who left the reservation to work in war industries or to fight -- about half will not return to life on the reservation.

And finally, you also have social and demographic changes besides ethnic and racial. And one important one to know about is the role of women during World War II. Over 200,000 women served in the military in non-combat roles, but they're serving nonetheless in the US Armed Forces. They were not allowed to serve in combat during the war. And the big impact is this: as the demand for industrial and defense jobs increased, nearly 5 million women entered the workforce during World War II. Many of these women are working in the shipyards and the defense plants. They are women who in many cases never worked before. Many of them are married and their husbands are off overseas fighting. And they play a key role. And the symbol of this is Rosie the Riveter.

In spite of these opportunities, women continue to receive lower pay than men and were expected to leave once the war was over. They were considered substitutes, not replacements. And another key thing regardless of race or gender is you're going to have huge demographic changes occur as many, many people head to the Midwest and also the West Coast looking for defense jobs. It's not just African-American individuals moving but large migrations of people. In fact, following World War II you're going to have a post-war migration to the Sun Belt. Southern states are going to see huge numbers of people going to them and also the west coast to places like California. The warm weather, the lower labor cost and the presence of defense factories are going to have this huge population pool to these regions.

Now it's going to be the Japanese American community in which World War II is going to have the biggest impact. And you're going to see the complete denial of civil liberties. Now don't forget there was already a lot of anti-Asian sentiment in the United States -- nativism towards groups whether they be Japanese or Chinese. The bombing of Pearl Harbor only accelerates and increases that. In fact, following the bombing on December 7th, Executive Order 9066 is passed by the US government which requires that all people of Japanese descent on the west coast be relocated to internment camps. It did not matter that many of these individuals were Nisei -- second generation Japanese Americans. They are American citizens. They own businesses. They went to US public schools. It was completely disregarded because there was this feeling that perhaps these individuals were going to be potential spies for the government of Japan.

Now keep in mind there is no evidence of any wrongdoing of any of these individuals. And over 100,000 Japanese Americans and people of Japanese descent were relocated to one of 10 internment camps throughout the country. Interesting to know is the large Japanese population in Hawaii -- where Pearl Harbor actually was and where the attack took place -- they were not evacuated because it would have devastated the economy of Hawaii. Japanese laborers were the key group in that region.

There is an important lawsuit that you need to know: Korematsu versus the United States. It goes all the way to the Supreme Court. There is Fred Korematsu right there. And the Supreme Court upheld the relocation as necessary for national security. And by now you should realize that during times of national security threats or perceived threats -- especially wars -- individual civil liberties go down and are often times violated. And another thing to keep in mind is thousands of Japanese Americans -- many with their families in one of these camps -- fought bravely for the United States. And there's a great quote by Harry Truman recognizing that bravery: "You fought not only the enemy, you fought prejudice at home and won."

Now you don't need to know a whole lot about the fighting of World War II -- even though it's really exciting stuff -- but a couple of key things here to get you ready for your exam. The Allies are going to focus first on the European theater of the war. In fact, that was the focus following Pearl Harbor even though it was Japan who attacked us.

And a couple of key moments that you should know about: the Soviets finally stopped the German advance at Stalingrad and start pushing the Nazi army out of the Soviet Union. The Allies -- England and the US especially -- focus first on North Africa and into Italy as their strategy. And eventually you're going to have the second front which is going to take place on June 6, 1944 -- the famous D-Day invasion.

Now if it was industrial production of the United States that's going to play a key role in the victory, it's also going to be Allied military and political cooperation that's going to be another key factor. In fact, during the war, The Big Three -- Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin -- are going to meet numerous times to discuss military strategy and also to plan for the post-war world.

Couple of these conferences you should know about: the first one is in January of 1943, and this is the first time that Roosevelt and Churchill meet once we are in the war. Remember they had previously met at the Atlantic Conference. Now they're meeting during the war, and they decide on a couple of things -- Stalin's not there. One, the war is going to be only finished with unconditional surrender of the Axis powers. And they choose that they're going to invade Sicily and Italy first -- which makes Stalin not too happy because he wanted relief for the Soviet Red Army from the German invasion.

Another conference to keep in mind is the Tehran Conference. This is the first time the Big Three meet. There you see all three of them there in November of 1943. They decide a couple of things: one, they start planning the opening of the second front that Stalin really wanted to relieve the Soviet Army once again. And that's going to be eventually the D-Day invasion. And they also talk about the fate of Eastern Europe. And this is going to be a key thing in the post-war world. Stalin wants to control Eastern Europe. He wants to divide up Germany. Churchill and Roosevelt want a free Eastern Europe. Conflict developing, but they tried to avoid it so they could focus on winning the war.

And the big one happens in 1945 -- the Yalta Conference. Germany, it is decided, will be divided into four zones. And both Churchill and Roosevelt feel they got Stalin to agree that there are going to be free elections in Eastern Europe. The third important thing to keep in mind -- and this one's key -- is the Soviets promised they will help out the US against Japan 3 months after the war in Europe is over. And then finally they also agree to create a new international organization -- the United Nations.

Eventually both Mussolini and Hitler are defeated, and the United States then is able to turn its attention on the war against Japan. Important to keep in mind: it was largely the US military responsible for the fight against Japan during the early periods of the war. And if you look at this map following Pearl Harbor, Japan was really kicking some butt. They occupied all the territory in the orange -- the Philippines, Indonesia and much of Asia.

The strategy of the United States in this early period is called island hopping. Basically the goal is really simple: you strategically win control over territory to get closer to mainland Japan. And the idea is you skip certain islands that Japan occupied, and eventually the US military would get close enough where they could start aerial bombing of Japan.

In July of 1945 at the Potsdam Conference, you have another meeting. By this point the war in Europe is over. Roosevelt has unfortunately passed away, and Truman -- the new president -- is meeting with Joseph Stalin. And they agree on one very important thing that you need to know about: they said Japan you need to surrender unconditionally or you will be destroyed.

While at the Potsdam Conference, Truman is informed that the Manhattan Project had successfully detonated the first atomic bomb. And on August 6th, 1945, the first atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima as planned and as promised at the Yalta conference. On August 8th, the Soviet Union enters the war against Japan -- 3 months after Germany had surrendered. And the next day on August 9th, the second atomic bomb is dropped on Japan at Nagasaki. Shortly thereafter, Japan does surrender and World War II ends.

The dropping of these two atomic bombs is not without controversy, and it's important you understand the different arguments for and against the dropping of the bombs. But key idea here: following World War II, the US will be the dominant political and military country in the world. Although we were isolationists when World War II began, at the end of World War II the United States is going to play a key role in the international community.

That's going to do it for today. If you haven't done so already, make sure you subscribe. If the video helped you out, click like and tell all your classmates. There I am in Nagasaki taking a look at a full-size model of the atomic bomb that was dropped on the city of Nagasaki. And as you can see next to my 6'5" self, it is quite a large bomb. Until next time, thank you for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace.
