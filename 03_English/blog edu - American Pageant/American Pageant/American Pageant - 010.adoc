== 释义

what’s up everyone? today we’re taking a look at Jeffersonian America 杰斐逊时代的美国. + 
 we’re going to cover the period 1800 to 1812, and let’s get right into it. + 


so in 1800 there’s an election, and John Adams is running again for a second term, and he’s doing a rematch 复赛；再次较量 with Thomas Jefferson. + 
 and in the election of 1800, Federalist 联邦党人 lost control of both not only the presidency (the executive branch 行政部门) but also Congress (the legislative branch 立法部门), and Thomas Jefferson becomes the first Democratic Republican 民主共和党人 president ever in our nation’s history. + 
 and some people refer to it as the Revolution of 1800 1800 年革命，and it’s not a revolution in the sense of violence or radical change 激进变革. + 
 it is the first peaceful transfer of power 权力和平交接 between political parties, and it really shows the Constitution system 宪法体系 was working and power was handed over peacefully. + 
 in fact, Jefferson even says at his inaugural address 就职演说: "we are all Republicans, we are all Federalists," and the nation’s going to continue to function even though political parties are there and power is transferring between one and the other. + 


the Federalists are not going to go away without a fight. + 
 in fact, they’re going to try to take control of the judicial branch 司法部门，and they wanted to maintain some grip on Power 保持对权力的控制. + 
 and Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801 1801 年司法法案，and what this act basically did is it created new judicial positions (new judge positions) that needed to be filled, and these are going to be filled with Federalist candidates at the last minute of John Adams Administration. + 
 they’re called the midnight appointments 午夜任命 because basically they’re filling them with pro - Federalist people, and it’s an attempt by Adams Administration to put Federalist judges in place before leaving office. + 
 they lost the executive, they lost the legislative, they’re trying to maintain control of the judicial branch. + 


and something very important happens when one of the midnight judicial appointees, a guy by the name of William Marbury, sued the Secretary of State James Madison for refusing to deliver his commission 委任状. + 
 and this is important because it’s one of the most important cases in US history: it leads to the case Marbury versus Madison 马伯里诉麦迪逊案. + 
 and here’s what happens in Marbury versus Madison: the Supreme Court 最高法院 decides in 1803 that read the following parts of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was ruled unconstitutional 违宪的. + 
 and you don’t really need to worry about all the details there. + 
 super important point: this established the idea of judicial review 司法审查. + 
 what this means is the Supreme Court has the power to declare federal laws unconstitutional. + 
 so the judicial branch (the Supreme Court) determines the meaning of the Constitution. + 
 this is a massive expansion of judicial power 司法权力扩张，and it’s just one of many decisions that we’re going to see with the Chief Justice John Marshall 首席大法官约翰・马歇尔. + 
 he will dramatically increase the power of the federal government. + 
 he’s going to play a key role. + 
 we’ll cover some other cases, but make sure you know Marbury versus Madison and judicial review. + 


now back to Jefferson: how revolutionary was this transfer of political power? how Jeffersonian was Jefferson? remember the Jeffersonian Democratic Republican party was really created by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, and they believed in a couple of things such as a strict interpretation of the Constitution 对宪法的严格解释，limited federal government 有限联邦政府 (remember they were the state rights guys 州权主义者), and they believed in a nation of farmers 农业国家. + 
 so was this a Revolution of 1800?

well Jefferson has some policies: he eliminated the excise taxes 消费税 (especially the one on Whiskey), he wanted to lower the national debt 国债，he wanted to reduce the size of the military 军队规模，he pardoned 赦免 those who were arrested under the Sedition Act 煽动叛乱法. + 
 so he does a lot of things differently. + 
 but important to note: he does not dismantle 拆除；废除 all of the Federalist policies. + 
 he keeps the bank of the United States 美国银行，he doesn’t mess with that assumption plan 承担计划. + 
 in fact, even though he reduces the size of the military, he sends the Navy over to the Barbary Pirates 巴巴里海盗 to go try to fight them off rather than paying tribute 纳贡. + 
 so Jefferson doesn’t undo everything that happened under Washington and Adams Administrations. + 


Jefferson’s most famous moment comes when he attempted to buy New Orleans and a part of Florida from France. + 
 and really some background here is needed: Spain had ended the right of deposit 存栈权 granted in the Pinckney Treaty of 1795 (this free use of the port tax - free use of the port). + 
 they ended that, and at this point France had taken back control over the Louisiana Territory 路易斯安那领地. + 
 Napoleon had gotten it back from Spain, and he really wanted to establish or reestablish a French Empire in North America. + 


so Jefferson sends over James Monroe to buy this land for $10 million bucks (that land right there in the blue). + 
 some things happened: Napoleon offers to sell all of the Louisiana Territory for $15 million, and this is a huge chunk of land. + 
 couple of reasons why: one, there’s a revolution in Haiti (a slave revolt 奴隶起义) that was not only scaring Southern slaveholders in America, it was causing all sorts of havoc 混乱 for the French. + 
 Napoleon needed money to crush this rebellion, and he also needed money in his really intense fight against England that was going on throughout Europe. + 
 so he offers to sell this huge chunk of land to the United States. + 
 he abandons his dream of a new French Empire in North America, and as a result we get one of the best real estate bargains 房地产交易 ever. + 


now important to note: although the Constitution does not say the president could purchase foreign land (it’s not in the Constitution), Jefferson supported the deal, and this is really important to note because Jefferson used a loose interpretation of the Constitution 对宪法的宽松解释 and the idea of implied powers 隐含权力 to make the deal. + 
 remember he’s a strict interpreter of the Constitution, so he does not follow his principles and he does so anyways. + 
 he says the president has the power to make treaties 条约，therefore this deal can get made, and it is made. + 
 and it’s important that it was, 'cause the Louisiana Purchase 路易斯安那购地案 is hugely important: it doubles the size of the United States (before the Louisiana Purchase, after the Louisiana Purchase - huge chunk of land as you could see). + 
 not only that, it supports Jefferson’s vision of an agrarian society 农业社会 of independent farmers. + 
 he wanted a nation of farmers - this potentially can fulfill that vision. + 
 so Jefferson feels okay with abandoning his constitutional principles during this deal. + 


another important thing about the Louisiana Purchase is it avoided a potential threat: France along the nation’s borders. + 
 if Napoleon would have been successful at reestablishing a French Empire, this would have been a nightmare for the United States, and so they avoid that. + 
 it further weakened the Federalist Party because (keep in mind) this territory is not going to be urban or industrial like Hamilton and the Federalist favored - it’s going to be agricultural, and so that’s going to be a blow to the Federalist Party. + 
 and they’re going to oppose the Louisiana Purchase, but it’s still going to get done. + 


Lewis and Clark actually lead a scientific exploration 科学考察 of the trans - Mississippi West 密西西比河以西地区. + 
 Lewis was the personal secretary of Jefferson, and Clark was an army officer. + 
 for about two and a half years, them and a bunch of dudes go exploring: looking at the geography 地理，making scientific studies, and really important - this begins the start of US claims to the Oregon territory 俄勒冈领地 as they get over to this region by the end of their expedition, and claims to the Pacific Coast, which is going to lead us into all sorts of conflict with other nations including Native Americans eventually. + 


quick little side story about Aaron Burr: Aaron Burr was vice president during Jefferson’s first term of office. + 
 he’s dropped in the second term when Jefferson’s reelected in 1804, and he starts doing some wild things. + 
 he actually plotted 密谋 with some radical Federalists to secede 脱离 New England states from the union. + 
 they were going to create their own nation. + 
 and Alexander Hamilton helped defeat Aaron Burr in the New York election. + 
 there’s some personal insults that are exchanged, and Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr end up in a duel 决斗 in which the great Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton is killed by Aaron Burr (former vice president) killing the great Secretary of the Treasury 财政部长. + 
 at this point the political career of Aaron Burr is done. + 
 he goes on the run. + 
 he actually plotted to take part of Mexico from Spain and potentially unite it with Louisiana territory under his rule. + 
 eventually he’s put on trial for treason 叛国罪，but he is acquitted of the charges 被宣告无罪. + 
 and that’s a little just about the crazy of politics back in the 1800s. + 


now back to the foreign policy drama 外交政策危机. + 
 remember we were trying to maintain our neutrality policies 中立政策 not only under George Washington but under John Adams, and the war in Europe continue to cause problems for the United States. + 
 the Napoleonic wars 拿破仑战争 were going on, and this was a big problem because there were various violations of US neutrality 美国中立的侵犯. + 
 impressment 强制征兵 was taking place: this was the force enlistment 强制入伍 of Americans into the British Navy. + 
 they would actually seize ships 扣押船只，take the men off those ships, and force them into the British Navy, and this was no bueno 不好. + 


France issued the Berlin Decree 柏林敕令 in 1806 that said they would seize ships that were trying to trade with England, so many American ships and its cargo 货物 were seized by France. + 
 England issued their own orders in Council 枢密院令 in 1806 that said ships that were going to Europe to trade must stop in England first. + 
 so once again US neutrality is being tested. + 


the big moment happens though with an event called the Chesapeake - Leopard Affair 切萨皮克号事件 in 1807. + 
 an English ship known as the Leopard attacked an American ship (the Chesapeake). + 
 it is attacked right off the coast of Virginia. + 
 in fact, they’re demanding surrender of some deserters 逃兵. + 
 there was a refusal by the American ship, and shots are fired. + 
 three Americans are killed, four others are taken and forced into the British Navy, and there is a huge outcry 强烈抗议 in the United States. + 
 there’s a huge demand for war, a lot of pressure on Thomas Jefferson. + 
 and Jefferson’s response is not to go to war. + 
 his response to the Chesapeake Incident is to issue the Embargo Act of 1807 1807 年禁运法案. + 
 this Embargo Act basically said all US trade would be banned with all foreign nations. + 
 you can’t go to any destination into trade. + 


the impact of the Embargo Act was negative: the US economy plummeted 暴跌. + 
 you could see that right here on this graph. + 
 there is a huge decline in the value of not only exports 出口 but imports 进口，and especially in the New England region because of their reliance on shipping and trade, their economy was hurt the most. + 
 there was widespread smuggling 走私 to try to evade this Embargo Act, but nonetheless it backfired 适得其反，and American interest suffered. + 


little unintended consequences 意外后果 that happened as a result of the Embargo Act: it helped fuel the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 in the New England region. + 
 remember Jefferson was more in favor of agriculture; Hamilton was the industrial guy. + 
 well Jefferson’s policy help fuel the Industrial Revolution in America because if no goods are coming in from England or France, Americans start making them on their own, and eventually this Industrial Revolution will only spread. + 


just before Jefferson leaves office, he decides to repeal 废除 the Embargo Act, and shortly after that James Madison (his homie 朋友，the secretary of state) becomes president in 1809. + 
 the Embargo Act is repealed, and it’s actually replaced by something called the Non - Intercourse Act 禁止通商法案 (get your minds out of the gutter 别想歪了). + 
 in 1809, the United States could trade with all nations except France and England, and the whole idea behind this was to shut down trade with the nations that were violating our neutrality. + 
 it didn’t do much to help the economy - the economy still sucked. + 


eventually the Non - Intercourse Act was replaced by Macon’s Bill Number Two 梅肯第二法案. + 
 this bill said the US would end its embargo 禁运 if the country (whether it be France or England) respected US neutrality and freedom of the seas 海洋自由. + 
 so in essence, we would stop trading with their rival if France agrees to stop violating our neutrality, we’d stop our trade with England. + 
 Macon’s Bill Number Two doesn’t really work either. + 
 France temporarily agrees, but then they start seizing US ships all over over again. + 


an important development happens in 1810 when members of Congress are elected. + 
 they take office in 1811, and these guys are known as the War Hawks 战争鹰派. + 
 these are young congressmen mainly from the south and the West. + 
 so you got John C. + 
 Calhoun right there on the left from South Carolina, and then of course you got the famous Henry Clay from Kentucky, and they take office in 1811, and they are advocates - they advocated for war against England. + 
 they got a couple of reasons: they want to stop British harassment of American shipping 美国航运的骚扰；they also want to wipe out native resistance on the frontier 边疆的本土抵抗 (they feel the British are fueling that resistance by giving them weapons); and they want Canada as a part of the United States - they want to take it from England. + 
 so these guys start pressuring James Madison for war. + 


a little bit about Native resistance on the frontier: you should know about these two Shawnee brothers. + 
 you got one Tecumseh right there on the left, and his brother the Prophet (a religious leader). + 
 they began to organize a confederacy of tribes 部落联盟 east of the Mississippi River. + 
 they were tired of Americans encroaching on their land 侵占他们的土地，and so they’re going to resist and organize all the tribes in the region. + 
 they have some success, but unfortunately for them, eventually a general by the name of William Henry Harrison (who was governor of Indiana territory) organized an army and attacked native resistance in 1811 at the Battle of Tippecanoe 蒂珀卡努战役，and this is a huge blow for the Native Americans on the frontier. + 
 at the Battle of Tippecanoe, William Henry Harrison becomes a war hero (he’ll become president later on), and it’s a big blow to Native resistance and a win for American expansion. + 


all of these developments that we’ve already been covering eventually lead to the War of 1812 1812 年战争 being declared. + 
 James Madison asks Congress for a declaration of war, and he gets it in 1812, and here are the reasons: one, England’s arming of natives on the frontier (War Hawks really felt that the British were responsible for this resistance - they did get some weapons in aid, but it’s rather limited); two, England’s continued violations of US neutrality contributed to our decision to go to war (especially the memories and the bitterness over the Chesapeake - Leopard Affair); pressure from War Hawks in Congress (recall they want more land, they want to protect American honor, they have their sights on Canada and other territory); and don’t forget the Democratic Republican party tended to favor France in this battle over in Europe. + 
 and so the war is declared against England. + 
 we’ll find out how it turns out next time. +

== 中文翻译

大家好！今天我们要探讨杰斐逊时期的美国。我们将涵盖1800年至1812年这段时期，让我们直接进入正题。

1800年举行了一次选举，约翰·亚当斯再次竞选连任，他的对手仍然是托马斯·杰斐逊。在1800年的选举中，联邦党人不仅失去了对总统职位（行政部门）的控制，也失去了对国会（立法部门）的控制，托马斯·杰斐逊成为我们国家历史上第一位民主共和党总统。有些人将这次选举称为“1800年革命”，但这并非一场暴力或激进变革意义上的革命。这是政党之间第一次和平的权力交接，它真正表明宪政体系正在发挥作用，权力得到了和平移交。事实上，杰斐逊在他的就职演说中甚至说：“我们都是共和党人，我们都是联邦党人”，即使存在政党，权力在一个政党和另一个政党之间转移，国家也将继续运转。

联邦党人不会不战而退。事实上，他们将试图控制司法部门，他们想保持对权力的一些控制。国会通过了1801年的《司法法案》，该法案基本上设立了需要填补的新司法职位（新的法官职位），这些职位将在约翰·亚当斯政府执政的最后时刻由联邦党候选人填补。这些任命被称为“午夜任命”，因为他们基本上是用亲联邦党的人填补这些职位，这是亚当斯政府在离任前安插联邦党法官的企图。他们失去了行政部门，失去了立法部门，他们正试图维持对司法部门的控制。

当一位午夜任命的法官，名叫威廉·马伯里的人，起诉国务卿詹姆斯·麦迪逊拒绝交付他的任命状时，一件非常重要的事情发生了。这很重要，因为这是美国历史上最重要的案件之一：它导致了马伯里诉麦迪逊案。马伯里诉麦迪逊案的判决如下：最高法院于1803年裁定1789年《司法法案》的以下部分违宪。你不需要担心所有的细节。一个非常重要的点是：这确立了司法审查制度的思想。这意味着最高法院有权宣布联邦法律违宪。因此，司法部门（最高法院）决定宪法的含义。这是司法权力的巨大扩张，这只是我们将在首席大法官约翰·马歇尔领导下看到的众多判决之一。他将极大地增强联邦政府的权力。他将发挥关键作用。我们将介绍其他一些案例，但请务必了解马伯里诉麦迪逊案和司法审查制度。

现在回到杰斐逊：这种政治权力的转移有多么具有革命性？杰斐逊有多么“杰斐逊式”？记住，杰斐逊民主共和党实际上是由詹姆斯·麦迪逊和托马斯·杰斐逊创建的，他们信奉一些原则，例如对宪法的严格解释、有限的联邦政府（记住他们是州权的支持者），以及他们信奉一个由农民组成的国家。那么，这真的是一场1800年革命吗？

杰斐逊确实有一些政策：他取消了国内消费税（特别是威士忌税），他想降低国债，他想缩小军队规模，他赦免了那些因《煽动叛乱法案》而被捕的人。所以他做了很多不同的事情。但重要的是要注意：他并没有废除所有联邦党人的政策。他保留了美国银行，他没有触动债务承担计划。事实上，尽管他缩小了军队规模，但他还是派遣海军前往巴巴里海盗地区，试图击退他们，而不是支付贡品。因此，杰斐逊并没有推翻华盛顿和亚当斯政府时期发生的一切。

杰斐逊最著名的举动是他试图从法国购买新奥尔良和佛罗里达部分地区。这里确实需要一些背景知识：西班牙已经终止了1795年《平克尼条约》中授予的存放权（免费使用港口，免税使用港口）。他们终止了这项权利，此时法国已经重新控制了路易斯安那领地。拿破仑从西班牙手中夺回了这片领土，他真的想在北美建立或重建一个法兰西帝国。

因此，杰斐逊派遣詹姆斯·门罗以1000万美元的价格购买这片土地（地图上蓝色的那片区域）。结果发生了一些事情：拿破仑提议以1500万美元的价格出售整个路易斯安那领地，这是一块巨大的土地。原因有几个：第一，海地爆发了一场革命（奴隶起义），这不仅吓坏了美国南方的奴隶主，也给法国造成了各种各样的破坏。拿破仑需要资金来镇压这场叛乱，而且他还需要资金来应对他在整个欧洲与英国进行的非常激烈的战斗。因此，他提议将这块巨大的土地出售给美国。他放弃了在北美建立新法兰西帝国的梦想，结果我们获得了有史以来最划算的房地产交易之一。

现在需要注意的是：尽管宪法没有规定总统可以购买外国领土（宪法中没有），但杰斐逊支持这笔交易，这一点非常重要，因为杰斐逊使用了对宪法的宽松解释和隐含权力的思想来达成这笔交易。记住，他一直是对宪法的严格解释者，所以他并没有遵循自己的原则，但他还是这样做了。他说总统有权签订条约，因此可以达成这笔交易，而它也确实达成了。这笔交易非常重要，因为路易斯安那购地意义重大：它使美国的领土增加了一倍（路易斯安那购地之前，路易斯安那购地之后——正如你所见，这是一块巨大的土地）。不仅如此，它还支持了杰斐逊关于独立农民组成的农业社会的愿景。他想要一个由农民组成的国家——这笔交易有可能实现这个愿景。因此，杰斐逊觉得在这笔交易中放弃他的宪法原则是可以接受的。

路易斯安那购地的另一个重要之处在于它避免了一个潜在的威胁：法国位于美国边境。如果拿破仑成功地重建了一个法兰西帝国，那对美国来说将是一场噩梦，因此他们避免了这种情况。它进一步削弱了联邦党，因为（记住）这片领土不会像汉密尔顿和联邦党人所希望的那样是城市化或工业化的——它将是农业的，因此这对联邦党来说是一个打击。他们将反对路易斯安那购地，但这笔交易仍然会完成。

刘易斯和克拉克实际上领导了一次对密西西比河以西地区的科学考察。刘易斯是杰斐逊的私人秘书，克拉克是一名军官。大约两年半的时间里，他们和一群人一起进行考察：研究地理，进行科学研究，非常重要的是——这标志着美国开始对俄勒冈领土提出主张，因为在他们的探险结束时，他们到达了该地区，并对太平洋沿岸地区提出了主张，这将最终导致我们与包括印第安人在内的其他国家发生各种冲突。

关于亚伦·伯尔的一个小插曲：亚伦·伯尔在杰斐逊的第一个总统任期内担任副总统。在1804年杰斐逊再次当选后，他被排除在第二任期之外，然后他开始做一些疯狂的事情。他实际上与一些激进的联邦党人密谋，试图使新英格兰各州脱离联邦。他们打算建立自己的国家。亚历山大·汉密尔顿帮助在纽约的选举中击败了亚伦·伯尔。双方进行了一些人身攻击，最终亚历山大·汉密尔顿和亚伦·伯尔进行了一场决斗，伟大的联邦党领袖亚历山大·汉密尔顿被亚伦·伯尔（前副总统）杀死，伟大的财政部长就此丧生。至此，亚伦·伯尔的政治生涯结束了。他开始逃亡。他实际上密谋从西班牙手中夺取墨西哥的一部分，并可能将其与路易斯安那领土合并，置于他的统治之下。最终他因叛国罪被审判，但他被判无罪。这只是1800年代政治疯狂的一个小例子。

现在回到外交政策的戏剧。记住，我们不仅在乔治·华盛顿时期，而且在约翰·亚当斯时期都在努力维持我们的中立政策，而欧洲的战争继续给美国制造麻烦。拿破仑战争正在进行，这是一个大问题，因为美国的中立受到了各种侵犯。强征正在发生：这是强迫美国人加入英国海军。他们会扣押船只，将船上的人带走，强迫他们加入英国海军，这绝对不好。

法国在1806年颁布了柏林敕令，宣布将扣押任何试图与英国进行贸易的船只，因此许多美国船只及其货物被法国扣押。英国在1806年颁布了自己的枢密院令，规定任何前往欧洲进行贸易的船只都必须首先在英国停靠。因此，美国的中立再次受到考验。

然而，一个重大事件发生在1807年的切萨皮克-豹号事件中。一艘名为“豹号”的英国军舰袭击了一艘美国军舰（“切萨皮克号”）。袭击发生在弗吉尼亚海岸附近。事实上，他们要求交出一些逃兵。美国军舰拒绝了，然后双方开火。三名美国人被杀，另外四人被俘并被强迫加入英国海军，这在美国引起了巨大的抗议。民众强烈要求开战，托马斯·杰斐逊面临巨大的压力。而杰斐逊对切萨皮克事件的反应不是开战。他对切萨皮克事件的回应是颁布了1807年的《禁运法案》。这项《禁运法案》基本上规定，美国将禁止与所有外国进行贸易。你不能前往任何目的地进行贸易。

《禁运法案》的影响是负面的：美国经济急剧下滑。你可以在这张图上看到。不仅出口额大幅下降，进口额也大幅下降，尤其是在新英格兰地区，由于他们依赖航运和贸易，他们的经济受到的打击最大。为了逃避这项《禁运法案》，走私活动猖獗，但尽管如此，它还是适得其反，损害了美国的利益。

《禁运法案》带来了一些意想不到的后果：它帮助推动了新英格兰地区的工业革命。记住，杰斐逊更倾向于农业；汉密尔顿是工业的支持者。然而，杰斐逊的政策却帮助推动了美国的工业革命，因为如果没有任何商品从英国或法国进口，美国人就会开始自己制造，最终这场工业革命只会蔓延开来。

就在杰斐逊离任前，他决定废除《禁运法案》，不久之后，他的朋友、国务卿詹姆斯·麦迪逊于1809年成为总统。《禁运法案》被废除，取而代之的是所谓的《非交往法案》（别想歪了）。1809年，美国可以与除法国和英国以外的所有国家进行贸易，这项法案背后的整个想法是切断与那些侵犯我们中立的国家之间的贸易。它对经济的帮助不大——经济仍然很糟糕。

最终，《非交往法案》被《麦肯法案第二号》取代。该法案规定，如果该国（无论是法国还是英国）尊重美国的中立和海洋自由，美国将结束禁运。因此，本质上，如果法国同意停止侵犯我们的中立，我们将停止与他们的对手英国的贸易。《麦肯法案第二号》也没有真正奏效。法国暂时同意了，但随后他们又开始到处扣押美国船只。

1810年，国会议员选举产生，这是一个重要的发展。他们于1811年就职，这些人被称为“战争鹰派”。他们主要是来自南方和西部的年轻国会议员。左边是来自南卡罗来纳州的约翰·C·卡尔霍恩，然后当然还有来自肯塔基州的著名人物亨利·克莱，他们于1811年就职，他们是主张对英国开战的人。他们有几个原因：他们想阻止英国骚扰美国航运；他们还想消灭边境地区的印第安人抵抗（他们认为英国通过向他们提供武器来助长这种抵抗）；他们想要加拿大成为美国的一部分——他们想从英国手中夺取它。因此，这些人开始向詹姆斯·麦迪逊施压，要求开战。

关于边境地区的印第安人抵抗：你应该了解这两位肖尼族兄弟。左边是特库姆塞，他的兄弟是先知（一位宗教领袖）。他们开始组织密西西比河以东各部落的联盟。他们厌倦了美国人侵占他们的土地，因此他们将抵抗并组织该地区的所有部落。他们取得了一些成功，但不幸的是，最终一位名叫威廉·亨利·哈里森（印第安纳领地总督）的将军组织了一支军队，于1811年在蒂珀卡努战役中袭击了印第安人的抵抗，这对边境地区的印第安人来说是一个巨大的打击。在蒂珀卡努战役中，威廉·亨利·哈里森成为了一位战争英雄（他后来将成为总统），这对印第安人的抵抗是一个巨大的打击，也是美国扩张的胜利。

我们已经介绍的所有这些发展最终导致了1812年战争的爆发。詹姆斯·麦迪逊要求国会宣战，他在1812年获得了批准，原因如下：第一，英国在边境地区武装印第安人（战争鹰派真的认为英国应对这种抵抗负责——他们确实获得了一些武器援助，但这相当有限）；第二，英国持续侵犯美国中立促成了我们参战的决定（特别是对切萨皮克-豹号事件的记忆和痛苦）；国会中战争鹰派的压力（记住他们想要更多的土地，他们想维护美国的荣誉，他们觊觎加拿大和其他领土）；不要忘记民主共和党倾向于在这场欧洲战争中支持法国。因此，对英国宣战了。我们下次再来看看结果如何。

what's up everyone? today we're taking a
look at Jeffersonian America. we're going
to cover the period 1800 to 1812, and
let's get right into it.

so in 1800
there's an election, and John Adams is
running again for a second term, and he's
doing a rematch with Thomas Jefferson.
and in the election of 1800, Federalist
lost control of both not only the
presidency (the executive branch) but also
Congress (the legislative branch), and
Thomas Jefferson becomes the first
Democratic Republican president ever in
our nation's history. and some people
refer to it as the Revolution of 1800,
and it's not a revolution in the sense
of violence or radical change. it is the
first peaceful transfer of power between
political parties, and it really shows
the Constitution system was working and
power was handed over peacefully. in fact,
Jefferson even says at his inaugural
address: "we are all Republicans, we are
all Federalists," and the nation's going
to continue to function even though
political parties are there and power is
transferring between one and the other.

the Federalists are not going to go away
without a fight. in fact, they're going to
try to take control of the judicial
branch, and they wanted to maintain some
grip on Power. and Congress passed the
Judiciary Act of 1801, and what this act
basically did is it created new judicial
positions (new judge positions) that
needed to be filled, and these are going
to be filled with Federalist candidates
at the last minute of John Adams
Administration. they're called the
midnight appointments because basically
they're filling them with pro-
Federalist people, and it's an attempt by
Adams Administration to put Federalist
judges in place before leaving office.
they lost the executive, they lost the
legislative, they're trying to maintain
control of the judicial branch.

and
something very important happens when
one of the midnight judicial appointees,
a guy by the name of William Marbury,
sued the Secretary of State James
Madison for refusing to deliver his
commission. and this is important because
it's one of the most important cases in
US history: it leads to the case Marbury
versus Madison. and here's what happens
in Marbury versus Madison: the Supreme
Court decides in 1803 that read the following
parts of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was
ruled
unconstitutional. and you don't really
need to worry about all the details
there. super important point: this
established the idea of judicial review.
what this means is the Supreme Court has
the power to declare federal laws
unconstitutional. so the judicial branch
(the Supreme Court) determines the meaning
of the
Constitution. this is a massive expansion
of judicial power, and it's just one
of many decisions that we're going to
see with the Chief Justice John Marshall.
he will dramatically increase the power
of the federal government. he's going to
play a key role. we'll cover some other
cases, but make sure you know Marbury
versus Madison and judicial review.

now
back to Jefferson: how revolutionary was
this transfer of political power? how
Jeffersonian was Jefferson? remember the
Jeffersonian Democratic Republican party
was really created by James Madison and
Thomas Jefferson, and they believed in a
couple of things such as a strict
interpretation of the Constitution,
limited federal government (remember they
were the state rights guys), and they
believed in a nation of farmers. so was
this a Revolution of 1800?

well Jefferson
has some policies: he eliminated the
excise taxes (especially the one on
Whiskey), he wanted to lower the national
debt, he wanted to reduce the size of the
military, he pardoned those who were
arrested under the Sedition Act. so he
does a lot of things differently. but
important to note: he does not dismantle
all of the Federalist policies. he keeps
the bank of the United States, he doesn't
mess with that assumption plan. in fact,
even though he reduces the size of the
military, he sends the Navy over to the
Barbary Pirates to go try to fight them
off rather than paying tribute. so
Jefferson doesn't undo everything that
happened under Washington and Adams
Administrations.

Jefferson's most famous
moment comes when he attempted to buy
New Orleans and a part of Florida from
France. and really some background here
is needed: Spain had ended the right of
deposit granted in the Pinckney Treaty of
1795 (this free use of the port tax-free
use of the port). they ended that, and at
this point France had taken back control
over the Louisiana Territory. Napoleon
had gotten it back from Spain, and he
really wanted to establish or
reestablish a French Empire in North
America.

so Jefferson sends over James
Monroe to buy this land for $10 million
bucks (that land right there in the blue).
some things happened: Napoleon offers to
sell all of the Louisiana Territory for
$15 million, and this is a huge chunk of
land. couple of reasons why: one, there's a
revolution in Haiti (a slave revolt) that
was not only scaring Southern
slaveholders in America, it was causing
all sorts of havoc for the French.
Napoleon needed money to crush this
rebellion, and he also needed money in
his really intense fight against England
that was going on throughout Europe. so
he offers to sell this huge chunk of
land to the United States. he abandons
his dream of a new French Empire in
North America, and as a result we get one
of the best real estate bargains ever.

now important to note: although the
Constitution does not say the president
could purchase foreign land (it's not in
the Constitution), Jefferson supported the
deal, and this is really important to
note because Jefferson used a loose
interpretation of the Constitution and
the idea of implied powers to make the
deal. remember he's a strict interpreter
of the Constitution, so he does not
follow his principles and he does so
anyways. he says the president has the
power to make treaties, therefore this
deal can get made, and it is made. and
it's important that it was, 'cause the
Louisiana Purchase is hugely
important: it doubles the size of the
United States (before the Louisiana
Purchase, after the Louisiana Purchase -
huge chunk of land as you could see).
not only that, it supports Jefferson's vision
of an agrarian society of independent
farmers. he wanted a nation of farmers -
this potentially can fulfill that vision.
so Jefferson feels okay with abandoning
his constitutional principles during
this deal.

another important thing about
the Louisiana Purchase is it avoided a
potential threat: France along the
nation's borders. if Napoleon would have
been successful at reestablishing a
French Empire, this would have been a
nightmare for the United States, and so
they avoid that. it further weakened the
Federalist Party because (keep in mind)
this territory is not going to be urban
or industrial like Hamilton and the
Federalist favored - it's going to be
agricultural, and so that's going to be a
blow to the Federalist Party. and they're
going to oppose the Louisiana Purchase,
but it's still going to get done.

Lewis
and Clark actually lead a scientific
exploration of the trans-Mississippi
West. Lewis was the personal secretary of
Jefferson, and Clark was an army officer.
for about two and a half years, them and
a bunch of dudes go exploring: looking at
the geography, making scientific studies,
and really important - this begins the
start of US claims to the Oregon
territory as they get over to this
region by the end of their expedition,
and claims to the Pacific Coast, which is
going to lead us into all sorts of
conflict with other nations including
Native Americans eventually.

quick little
side story about Aaron Burr: Aaron Burr was
vice president during Jefferson's first
term of office. he's dropped in the
second term when Jefferson's reelected
in 1804, and he starts doing some wild
things. he actually plotted with some
radical Federalists to secede New
England states from the union. they were
going to create their own nation. and
Alexander Hamilton helped defeat Aaron
Burr in the New York election. there's
some personal insults that are exchanged,
and Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr
end up in a duel in which the great
Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton is
killed by Aaron Burr (former vice
president) killing the great Secretary of
the Treasury. at this point the political
career of Aaron Burr is done. he goes on
the run. he actually plotted to take part
of Mexico from Spain and potentially
unite it with Louisiana territory
under his rule. eventually he's put on
trial for treason, but he is acquitted of
the charges. and that's a little just
about the crazy of politics back in the
1800s.

now back to the foreign policy
drama. remember we were trying to
maintain our neutrality policies not
only under George Washington but under
John Adams, and the war in Europe
continue to cause problems for the
United States. the Napoleonic wars were
going on, and this was a big problem
because there were various violations of
US
neutrality. impressment was taking place:
this was the force enlistment of
Americans into the British Navy. they
would actually seize ships, take the men
off those ships, and force them into the
British Navy, and this was no bueno.

France issued the Berlin Decree in 1806
that said they would seize ships that
were trying to trade with England, so
many American ships and its cargo were
seized by France. England issued their
own orders in Council in 1806 that said
ships that were going to Europe to trade
must stop in England first. so once again
US neutrality is being tested.

the big
moment happens though with an event
called the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair in
1807. an English ship known as the
Leopard attacked an American ship (the
Chesapeake). it is attacked right off the
coast of Virginia. in fact, they're
demanding surrender of some deserters.
there was a refusal by the American ship,
and shots are fired. three Americans are
killed, four others are taken and forced
into the British Navy, and there is a
huge outcry in the United States. there's
a huge demand for war, a lot of pressure
on Thomas Jefferson. and Jefferson's
response is not to go to war. his
response to the Chesapeake Incident is
to issue the Embargo Act of 1807. this
Embargo Act basically said all US trade
would be banned with all foreign nations.
you can't go to any destination into
trade.

the impact of the Embargo Act was
negative: the US economy plummeted. you
could see that right here on this graph.
there is a huge decline in the value of
not only exports but imports, and
especially in the New England region
because of their reliance on shipping
and trade, their economy was hurt the
most. there was widespread smuggling to
try to evade this Embargo Act, but
nonetheless it backfired, and American
interest suffered.

little unintended
consequences that happened as a result
of the Embargo Act: it helped fuel the
Industrial Revolution in the New England
region. remember Jefferson was more in
favor of agriculture; Hamilton was the
industrial guy. well Jefferson's policy
help fuel the Industrial Revolution in
America because if no goods are coming
in from England or France, Americans
start making them on their own, and
eventually this Industrial Revolution
will only spread.

just before Jefferson
leaves office, he decides to repeal the
Embargo Act, and shortly after that James
Madison (his homie, the secretary of state)
becomes president in 1809. the Embargo
Act is repealed, and it's actually
replaced by something called the
Non-Intercourse Act (get your minds out
of the gutter). in 1809, the United States
could trade with all nations except
France and England, and the whole idea
behind this was to shut down trade with
the nations that were violating our
neutrality. it didn't do much to help the
economy - the economy still sucked.

eventually the Non-Intercourse Act was
replaced by Macon's Bill Number Two. this
bill said the US would end its embargo
if the country (whether it be France or
England) respected US neutrality and
freedom of the seas. so in essence, we
would stop trading with their rival if
France agrees to stop violating our
neutrality, we'd stop our trade with
England. Macon's Bill Number Two doesn't
really work either. France temporarily
agrees, but then they start seizing US
ships all over over again.

an important
development happens in 1810 when members
of Congress are elected. they take office
in 1811, and these guys are known as the
War Hawks. these are young congressmen
mainly from the south and the West. so
you got John C. Calhoun right there on
the left from South Carolina, and then of
course you got the famous Henry Clay
from Kentucky, and they take office in
1811, and they are advocates - they
advocated for war against England. they
got a couple of reasons: they want to
stop British harassment of American
shipping; they also want to wipe out
native resistance on the frontier (they
feel the British are fueling that
resistance by giving them weapons); and
they want Canada as a part of the United
States - they want to take it from England.
so these guys start pressuring James
Madison for war.

a little bit about
Native resistance on the frontier: you
should know about these two Shawnee
brothers. you got one Tecumseh right
there on the left, and his brother the
Prophet (a religious leader). they began to
organize a confederacy of tribes east of
the Mississippi River. they were tired of
Americans encroaching on their land, and
so they're going to resist and organize
all the tribes in the region. they have
some success, but unfortunately for them,
eventually a general by the name of
William Henry Harrison (who was governor
of Indiana territory) organized an army
and attacked native resistance in 1811
at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and this is a
huge blow for the Native Americans
on the frontier. at the Battle of Tippecanoe,
William Henry Harrison becomes a
war hero (he'll become president later on),
and it's a big blow to Native resistance
and a win for American expansion.

all of
these developments that we've already
been covering eventually lead to the War
of 1812 being declared. James Madison
asks Congress for a declaration of war,
and he gets it in 1812, and here are the
reasons: one, England's arming of natives
on the frontier (War Hawks really felt
that the British were responsible for
this resistance - they did get some
weapons in aid, but it's rather limited);
two, England's continued violations of US
neutrality contributed to our decision
to go to war (especially the memories and
the bitterness over the Chesapeake-
Leopard Affair); pressure from War Hawks in
Congress (recall they want more land, they
want to protect American honor, they have
their sights on Canada and other
territory); and don't forget the
Democratic Republican party tended to
favor France in this battle over in
Europe. and so the war is declared
against England. we'll find out how it
turns out next time.
