What's going down, internet people? Today we're taking a look at the path -- the road to World War II 第二次世界大战. We're also looking at Franklin Roosevelt's foreign policy 外交政策 between the years of 1932 to 1941.

And to start off, it's really key that you understand that Roosevelt's going to do a few things differently than previous presidents. For example, he is going to open up formal recognition 正式承认 of the Soviet Union. Up until Roosevelt, ever since the Russian Revolution 俄国革命 happened during World War I, the US had not opened up diplomatic relations 外交关系. And Roosevelt is doing this for a number of reasons: one, he's worried about the growing power of Germany, and more importantly he's really interested in possible trade with Soviet Union.

Roosevelt's going to attempt to improve the relations with Latin America. If you recall, there were all sorts of US interventions 干预 in Latin American countries, and he is going to adopt something called The Good Neighbor policy 睦邻政策 which he announces in his inaugural address 就职演说. Couple of examples of things he's actually going to do: the Marines are going to leave Haiti in 1934. In Cuba, he's going to get rid of the Platt Amendment which said the US can intervene. We are going to keep the base at Guantanamo. And other things trying to kind of patch things up 修补关系 between us and our Southern homies.

In 1934, the Reciprocal Trade Agreement 互惠贸易协定 is going to be put into effect. And this is a reduction of US tariffs 关税 if other countries do the same. In fact, for a very long time tariffs were extremely high and they really ruined international trade. They had been high ever since really the Civil War. They were increased -- remember the Hawley-Smoot Tariff 霍利-斯穆特关税法 -- and foreign trade had decreased. So this plan basically said if other nations reciprocate 互惠 a reduction in tariffs, the US would do the same.

However, the bulk of this video is going to be about World War II, and you can't understand that without the rise of totalitarianism 极权主义. And what was happening is all sorts of regimes 政权 really in the 1920s and also in the 30s are going to emerge. And what all these regimes have in common is the ultimate power was in the hands of the state in the government.

So for example, in 1922 in Italy, Mussolini and the fascist party 法西斯政党 comes to power. In the Soviet Union, you have the rise of Joseph Stalin. In Germany, you have the rise of the Nazi party 纳粹党 -- Adolf Hitler is elected in 1933. And in Japan, a militaristic government 军国主义政府 comes to power, and really in 1941 you have Hideki Tojo as the leader. And all of these different governments start pursuing different policies that militarize 军事化 their countries and seek to expand their borders.

And a couple of examples occur in 1931: Japan conquers Manchuria 满洲 which is a huge threat to the open door policy 门户开放政策 of the United States. And Japan also withdraws from the League of Nations and begins to build up their navy. Italy's also going to make some moves -- in 1935 they're going to attack Ethiopia. And in all of these examples, the League of Nations does nothing to intervene.

Now how are these threats responded to back home in America? And the reality is many Americans were disillusioned 幻想破灭 with their participation in World War I. In fact, there was a commission setup called the Nye Commission 奈伊委员会 in 1934 -- not that guy, this guy. And what the commission decided in their investigation was that the real cause of American involvement in World War I was the result of American bankers and arms manufacturers 军火制造商. They caused our entry -- it wasn't so much the German submarines sinking ships, it was really the desire of these groups to make money.

And the findings of the Nye Commission and the general feeling of the American public -- remember we're going through the Great Depression 大萧条 -- leads many Americans to support US neutrality 中立. In fact, Congress passes a series of laws to guarantee the US would stay out of a potential conflict in Europe. And you could see that in this political cartoon. These laws are known as the Neutrality Acts 中立法案. There are various acts passed in 1935, 1936 and 1937, and the whole purpose of them was to keep us out of a potential conflict.

Couple of examples: in 1935 the Neutrality Act said no American citizen could sail on the ships of belligerent nations 交战国 -- so nations that were at war, US citizens were forbidden from traveling on those ships. Remember what happened with the Lusitania -- they want to avoid things like that. The Neutrality Acts also outlawed the sales of arms or weapons to countries that are at war -- once again trying to keep us out of a potential conflict. And the Neutrality Acts also outlawed the giving of loans to nations at war.

Important to note is the US could not help out even if a country was the innocent victim of aggression 侵略. So when Japan attacks China, the US cannot provide them any help. Now Roosevelt was reluctant to sign these into law, but the sentiment of the United States was to preserve our neutrality to ensure it at all cost.

Now the policy of appeasement 绥靖政策 is really not going to work -- it's going to backfire 适得其反. And you're going to see that happening in a series of events that take place. You know in Spain there is a civil war -- the fascist government of Francisco Franco is going to attack and eventually overthrow the loyalist government. In fact, Francisco Franco is getting aid by Hitler and Mussolini. And from 1936 to 1939, eventually that civil war ends and a military dictatorship 军事独裁 is put into place. And the neutrality laws keep the US from sending weapons to help the loyalist government.

Hitler is going to openly violate the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, there's a whole bunch of examples of this: he occupies the Rhineland 莱茵兰 in 1936 -- it was supposed to be demilitarized 非军事化的. He starts to build up the German military. He annexes 吞并 Austria in 1938. And then he demands a piece of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland 苏台德地区. In the Sudetenland there was a large German-speaking population, and Hitler claims they need to be a part of the German nation.

In response to Hitler's demands for the Sudetenland, there is a meeting called the Munich Conference 慕尼黑会议 where the leaders -- really England is taking a lead role here -- they agreed to hand over the Sudetenland to Germany. Hitler must promise that this will be the last of his territorial demands, and he does promise that -- that's it if he gets it. And this is known as the policy of appeasement.

Really though, it's important to keep in mind the Munich Conference comes to symbolize the failed policy of appeasement because just 6 months later, Hitler is going to take over the rest of Czechoslovakia -- going back on his word 食言 at Munich.

Events are not just looking bad in Europe. In fact, Japan invades the rest of China in 1937. Because of the neutrality laws, Roosevelt is unable to help China. He does issue a kind of quarantine notice 隔离通知. And really once again, Japan's invasion of China is seen as a threat to the open door policy of the United States. And once again tensions are running high. In fact, Japan sinks a US gunboat 炮艇 called the Panay and quickly apologizes so to avoid war between Japan and the US.

So how does this war begin? Well, Germany and the Soviet Union shocked the world when they signed a non-aggression pact 互不侵犯条约 in August of 1939. They agree that they're not going to attack one another -- creepy image right there of Stalin and Hitler getting married. And this allows Hitler to attack Poland without having to worry about a two-front war 两线作战 -- he doesn't have to worry about the Soviets or possibly England or France on the other side. Hitler and Stalin secretly agreed to divide Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union.

England and France finally take a stand 表明立场. They recognize that appeasement was failing and they pledged to defend Poland. And on September 1st, 1939, Germany invades Poland. And very quickly France and England declare war. And this is the beginning of World War II -- it will last from 1939 to 1945.

But what you need to realize is very quickly -- in fact by June of 1940 -- Hitler had quickly conquered most of Europe with his Blitzkrieg 闪电战 or lightning war. All those you see in the light yellow color were controlled by the Axis powers 轴心国 by 1942.

The United States remains neutral, but it's important to understand that in spite of this neutrality, they do not want the Axis powers to win. The dilemma 困境 for Roosevelt is how do we help the Allies while also preserving our neutrality? And what you're going to see is there is a real prospect of Hitler taking over all of Europe. France falls relatively quickly.

And as a result, Congress amends 修订 the neutrality legislation. And this is the Neutrality Act of 1939. This is a shift and amendment to the previous laws, and it says this: countries could buy weapons as long as they paid for them in cash and they carried them in their own ships. This is the cash and carry provision 现购自运条款. What this does is it lifts the arms embargo 武器禁运 and allows the United States to help out countries that were the victims of Axis power aggression.

However, there were severe limits to this because many countries did not have enough cash available, nor did they have the ability to carry weapons from the United States to help them fight the nations of Japan, Italy or Germany. In fact, China is completely unable to take advantage of the cash and carry act. With this revision, you have to really think about -- are we really neutral? We are trying to help out the Allies while also maintaining as much neutrality as possible.

Well, in spite of the cash and carry act, by June of 1940 most of France is defeated -- there's Hitler's selfie in front of the Eiffel Tower. In September of 1940, the United States adopts the first peacetime draft 和平时期征兵 to get ready for a potential conflict. And in August of 1940, you have the Battle of Britain 不列颠之战 taking place in which Germany begins bombing England, preparing for a potential invasion of England.

US involvement increases. In fact, there's a huge debate as England is getting bombed about what we are going to do -- what policy we're going to pursue. And you have some people joining groups such as the Committee to Defend America 保卫美国委员会. They advocated helping England and the Allies, and the reason was if we help out England, this would help America by avoiding a conflict coming to our shores.

Another group you should know about is the America First Committee 美国优先委员会. They opposed US involvement -- Charles Lindbergh was one of their speakers -- and they were staunch isolationists 坚定的孤立主义者. They did not want the United States to get involved at all. In fact, they opposed any amendments to the Neutrality Acts.

As England was struggling in its fight against Germany, another plan is adopted called the Destroyers for Bases 驱逐舰换基地 in September of 1940. The program said the US would give England US destroyers -- old ships -- in exchange for military bases in the Western Hemisphere. And this was a win for England -- they needed get some ships, and this was Roosevelt's way of helping out England without once again actually doing the fighting.

In that same year in 1940, Roosevelt breaks the two-term tradition of Washington and wins an unprecedented third term 史无前例的第三届任期. In fact, Republicans criticize him for running for a third term. But there's this belief that we want a trusted leader to lead the nation during this time of crisis.

And one of the big things that Roosevelt had to address 处理；应对；设法解决 in his third term was the fact that England was barely holding on 支撑；勉强维持生存 against German attacks. In fact, the leader at the time Winston Churchill -- I like to imagine a fictional 虚构的；虚假的 conversation: "We need help! Damn Neutrality Acts!" Roosevelt would say, "Help? I have a plan." And that plan was this -- it's called the Lend-Lease Act 租借法案.

And the Lend-Lease Act 租借法案 is really a result of Roosevelt worried 担心的；忧虑的 about the threat 威胁；危险 of an Axis power victory. And so the Lend-Lease 租借 bill was passed 通过（法律、提案等） in March of 1941, and it eliminated 消除；排除；废除 the cash and carry 现付现运政策（美国中立法案中一项，要求交战国现金购买并自行运输） requirements. And it said the US would send supplies 物资；补给品 to countries that were the victim 受害者；牺牲品 of aggression 侵略；攻击行为. And the justification 正当理由；辩解；辩护 for this program was this: by being the "great arsenal 兵工厂；军火库 of democracy 民主；民主制度" (Roosevelt called it), the US would avoid having to fight.

Roosevelt likened 把…比作 the Lend-Lease Act 租借法案 to a neighbor 邻居 giving a hose 水管 to one of his neighbors when their house was on fire. And at the end of the war, the idea would be the used 用过的 weapons or equivalent 等价的；相等的；相同的 items would be sent back to the United States. There's no question now that the US was not truly neutral 中立的；不支持任何一方的 -- we are openly siding with 支持；站在…一边 the British and the other Allies 同盟国；协约国. This by many accounts is an economic 经济的；财政的 declaration 宣布；宣告 of war against the Axis powers. And as US factories 工厂 shift 转变；改变方向 to all-out war production 生产；制造, the Great Depression is effectively over.

And a bad move occurs 发生；出现 on June 22nd, 1941 -- Operation Barbarossa 巴巴罗萨行动（纳粹德国入侵苏联的军事行动）. Hitler decides to go back on his pledge 誓言；保证；承诺 with Joseph Stalin and he invades 入侵；侵略 the Soviet Union with a sneak 偷偷的；突袭的 attack. And what this does is it puts Russia (as you can see in the bottom right cartoon 漫画) into the bed with the rest of the Allies.

So how do we get to war? We're so close. Well, Roosevelt decides to further 推进；促进 his assistance to the Allied Powers 同盟国 with the Allied convoy system 盟军护航系统. The US begins escorting 护送；护卫 the Lend-Lease supplies across the Atlantic Ocean 大西洋. German U-boats 潜艇（尤指德国的） made traveling the Atlantic very dangerous 危险的, and the US is actually making sure that equipment gets to countries such as England. And this is really an undeclared 未正式宣布的 war against Germany because Roosevelt gives the authority 权力；权限 to shoot on sight 见即开火 if you see German ships -- fire!

An important meeting takes place called the Atlantic Conference 大西洋会议. FDR meets Churchill secretly 秘密地 off the coast 海岸；海滨 of Newfoundland 纽芬兰（加拿大东部的一个省）, and they developed something called the Atlantic Charter 大西洋宪章. And this document is really nothing more than the goals 目标；目的 for the post-war world. It calls for self-determination 自决权（国家或民族自行决定其政治地位）, free trade 自由贸易, no territorial 领土的；土地的 gains as a result of this war. There should be a new collective 共同的；集体的 security 安全；治安 organization 组织；机构 -- no more League of Nations 国际联盟 -- something better. And other things.

However, US entry 进入；加入 into World War II will not come as a result of events in Europe. It's actually going to be our beef 冲突；争执（非正式） with Japan that'll bring us into this war. Quick reminder: remember the US was alone in trying to check 制止；抑制 Japanese expansion into Asia. They start with Manchuria 满洲（中国东北地区） in 1932. And Roosevelt in response to all-out war against China (which really begins in 1937) orders an embargo 禁运；贸易禁令 against Japan.

Remember Japan is an island nation, so their resources 资源；物资 are limited. And Roosevelt shuts off trade of things like steel 钢铁 and iron 铁 as a result of this embargo. And also because of their own territorial 领土的 desires 欲望；愿望, Japan occupies 占领；占据 French Indochina 法属印度支那（包括今天的越南、老挝、柬埔寨） (really Vietnam, Thailand and so on) in July of 1941. In fact, you could see the expansion 扩张；扩展 of Japanese territory each year on that map. Roosevelt orders all Japanese assets 资产；财产 frozen 冻结的 and a ban 禁止；禁令 on oil sales.

Japan desperate 极需要的；迫切的；拼命的 for these oil resources and also wanting to unfreeze 解冻；取消冻结 their assets in the United States enters into negotiations 谈判；协商 between the US and Japan. But as those negotiations are ongoing, Japan secretly 秘密地；暗中地 attacks 袭击；进攻 the United States on December 7th, 1941 at Pearl Harbor 珍珠港（夏威夷）. And that attack will forever be known as "a day which will live in infamy 臭名昭著；声名狼藉."

That's going to do it for today. Hopefully you learned 学到了 a whole bunch. If you did, click like on the video. If you haven't done so, subscribe 订阅；关注. Tell like everyone you know to do the same. If you have any questions or comments, post them in that little section called comments 评论；意见. And have a beautiful day. Peace.

各位网络朋友，大家好！今天我们来探讨第二次世界大战的道路——通往第二次世界大战的道路。我们还将关注富兰克林·罗斯福在1932年至1941年间的对外政策。

首先，至关重要的是要理解，罗斯福将采取一些与以往总统不同的做法。例如，他将正式承认苏联。自从第一次世界大战期间发生俄国革命以来，直到罗斯福时期，美国一直没有建立外交关系。罗斯福这样做有几个原因：一是担心德国日益增长的实力，更重要的是，他非常希望与苏联进行贸易。

罗斯福将试图改善与拉丁美洲的关系。如果你们还记得，美国曾对拉丁美洲国家进行各种干预，他将采取一项名为“睦邻政策”的措施，并在他的就职演说中宣布了这一政策。他实际采取的一些行动的例子：海军陆战队将于1934年撤离海地。在古巴，他将废除允许美国干预的普拉特修正案。我们将保留在关塔那摩的基地。以及其他试图修复我们与南方邻居关系的举措。

1934年，《互惠贸易协定》将生效。如果其他国家也这样做，美国将降低关税。事实上，长期以来，关税一直非常高，严重破坏了国际贸易。自从南北战争以来，关税一直很高。还记得《斯姆特-霍利关税法》吗？关税被提高了，对外贸易减少了。因此，这项计划基本上规定，如果其他国家也降低关税，美国也会这样做。

然而，本视频的大部分内容将是关于第二次世界大战的，不了解极权主义的兴起就无法理解第二次世界大战。当时的情况是，各种各样的政权在20年代和30年代兴起。所有这些政权的共同点是，最终权力掌握在国家和政府手中。

例如，1922年，墨索里尼和法西斯党在意大利上台。在苏联，约瑟夫·斯大林崛起。在德国，纳粹党崛起——阿道夫·希特勒于1933年当选。在日本，军国主义政府上台，实际上在1941年，东条英机成为领导人。所有这些不同的政府都开始推行不同的政策，使他们的国家军事化并寻求扩张边界。

1931年发生了一些例子：日本占领了满洲，这对美国的门户开放政策构成了巨大威胁。日本还退出了国际联盟，并开始扩充海军。意大利也将采取一些行动——1935年，他们将袭击埃塞俄比亚。在所有这些例子中，国际联盟都没有采取任何干预措施。

那么，美国国内是如何回应这些威胁的呢？现实是，许多美国人对他们参与第一次世界大战感到失望。事实上，1934年成立了一个名为奈伊委员会的委员会——不是那个人，是这个人。委员会在其调查中得出的结论是，美国卷入第一次世界大战的真正原因是美国银行家和军火制造商。他们导致了我们的介入——与其说是德国潜艇击沉船只，不如说是这些集团渴望赚钱。

奈伊委员会的调查结果和美国公众的普遍感受——记住我们正经历大萧条——导致许多美国人支持美国中立。事实上，国会通过了一系列法律来保证美国不会卷入欧洲可能发生的冲突。你们可以在这幅政治漫画中看到这一点。这些法律被称为《中立法案》。1935年、1936年和1937年通过了各种法案，其全部目的是使我们远离潜在的冲突。

举几个例子：1935年的《中立法案》规定，任何美国公民都不得乘坐交战国——即处于战争状态的国家——的船只，美国公民被禁止乘坐这些船只。还记得卢西塔尼亚号事件吗？他们想避免类似的事情再次发生。《中立法案》还禁止向处于战争状态的国家出售武器或军火——再次试图使我们远离潜在的冲突。《中立法案》还禁止向处于战争状态的国家提供贷款。

重要的是要注意，即使一个国家是侵略的无辜受害者，美国也无法提供帮助。因此，当日本袭击中国时，美国无法向他们提供任何帮助。罗斯福不愿签署这些法律，但美国的普遍情绪是尽一切代价维护我们的中立。

绥靖政策实际上不会奏效——它会适得其反。你们将在接下来发生的一系列事件中看到这一点。你们知道，在西班牙发生了一场内战——弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥的法西斯政府将袭击并最终推翻效忠派政府。事实上，弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥得到了希特勒和墨索里尼的援助。从1936年到1939年，内战最终结束，建立了一个军事独裁政权。中立法阻止了美国向效忠派政府运送武器。

希特勒将公开违反《凡尔赛条约》。事实上，这有很多例子：1936年他占领了莱茵兰——莱茵兰本应非军事化。他开始扩充德国军队。1938年他吞并了奥地利。然后他要求割让捷克斯洛伐克的一块领土，称为苏台德地区。苏台德地区有大量的德语人口，希特勒声称他们需要成为德意志民族的一部分。

为了回应希特勒对苏台德地区的要求，召开了一次会议，称为慕尼黑会议，与会领导人——实际上英国在此发挥了主导作用——同意将苏台德地区交给德国。希特勒必须承诺这将是他最后一次领土要求，而他确实承诺了——如果他得到苏台德地区，这就是最后一次。这被称为绥靖政策。

然而，重要的是要记住，慕尼黑会议象征着绥靖政策的失败，因为仅仅6个月后，希特勒就将吞并捷克斯洛伐克的其余部分——背弃了他在慕尼黑的诺言。

欧洲的局势并不乐观。事实上，1937年日本入侵了中国的其余地区。由于中立法，罗斯福无法帮助中国。他确实发布了一种隔离声明。日本入侵中国再次被视为对美国门户开放政策的威胁。紧张局势再次升级。事实上，日本击沉了一艘名为帕奈号的美国炮艇，并迅速道歉，以避免日本和美国之间的战争。

那么这场战争是如何开始的呢？1939年8月，德国和苏联签署了一项互不侵犯条约，震惊了世界。他们同意互不攻击——右边那张斯大林和希特勒结婚的可怕图片。这使得希特勒可以攻击波兰而不必担心两线作战——他不必担心苏联，也不必担心另一边的英国或法国。希特勒和斯大林秘密同意瓜分波兰。

英国和法国终于采取了立场。他们认识到绥靖政策正在失败，并承诺保卫波兰。1939年9月1日，德国入侵波兰。很快，法国和英国对德国宣战。这就是第二次世界大战的开始——它将持续从1939年到1945年。

但你们需要认识到，很快——事实上到1940年6月——希特勒就用他的闪电战迅速征服了欧洲大部分地区。你们在浅黄色区域看到的所有地方到1942年都被轴心国控制。

美国保持中立，但重要的是要理解，尽管如此，他们不希望轴心国获胜。罗斯福的困境是如何在保持中立的同时帮助盟国？你们将看到，希特勒很有可能占领整个欧洲。法国相对较快地沦陷了。

因此，国会修改了中立法。这就是1939年的《中立法案》。这是对先前法律的转变和修正，它规定：各国可以购买武器，只要他们用现金支付并用自己的船只运输。这就是“现金和运输”条款。它的作用是解除了武器禁运，允许美国帮助那些遭受轴心国侵略的国家。

然而，这存在严重的限制，因为许多国家没有足够的现金，也没有能力从美国运输武器来帮助他们对抗日本、意大利或德国。事实上，中国完全无法利用“现金和运输”法案。通过这项修订，你们必须认真思考——我们真的中立吗？我们试图帮助盟国，同时也尽可能地保持中立。

尽管有“现金和运输”法案，到1940年6月，法国大部分地区都被击败了——这是希特勒在埃菲尔铁塔前的自拍。1940年9月，美国通过了第一个和平时期征兵法案，为潜在的冲突做准备。1940年8月，不列颠空战爆发，德国开始轰炸英国，为可能入侵英国做准备。

美国的介入增加了。事实上，当英国遭受轰炸时，关于我们将采取什么行动——我们将奉行什么政策——存在着激烈的辩论。有些人加入了诸如“保卫美国委员会”之类的组织。他们主张帮助英国和盟国，原因是如果我们帮助英国，这将通过避免冲突蔓延到我们的国土来帮助美国。

你们应该了解的另一个组织是“美国第一委员会”。他们反对美国介入——查尔斯·林德伯格是他们的发言人之一——他们是坚定的孤立主义者。他们根本不希望美国卷入其中。事实上，他们反对任何对《中立法案》的修正案。

当英国在与德国的战斗中苦苦挣扎时，另一项计划于1940年9月通过，称为“驱逐舰换基地”。该计划规定，美国将向英国提供美国的驱逐舰——旧船——以换取西半球的军事基地。这对英国来说是一场胜利——他们需要一些船只，而这是罗斯福在不实际参战的情况下帮助英国的方式。

同年，1940年，罗斯福打破了华盛顿总统连任两届的传统，赢得了前所未有的第三个任期。事实上，共和党人批评他竞选第三个任期。但人们相信，在这个危机时期，我们需要一位值得信赖的领导人来领导国家。

罗斯福在他的第三个任期内必须解决的一个重大问题是，英国几乎无法抵挡德国的进攻。事实上，当时的领导人温斯顿·丘吉尔——我喜欢想象一个虚构的对话：“我们需要帮助！该死的中立法案！”罗斯福会说：“帮助？我有一个计划。”那个计划就是——它被称为《租借法案》。

《租借法案》实际上是罗斯福担心轴心国胜利的威胁的结果。因此，《租借法案》于1941年3月通过，它取消了“现金和运输”的要求。它规定美国将向遭受侵略的国家运送物资。这项计划的理由是：通过成为（罗斯福所称的）“民主国家的伟大兵工厂”，美国将避免参战。

罗斯福将《租借法案》比作邻居在另一个邻居的房子着火时给他一根水管。战争结束后，其想法是将用过的武器或同等物品送回美国。毫无疑问，美国现在并非真正中立——我们公开站在英国和其他盟国一边。许多人认为这是对轴心国发起的经济上的宣战。随着美国工厂转向全力生产战争物资，大萧条实际上已经结束。

1941年6月22日发生了一个糟糕的举动——“巴巴罗萨行动”。希特勒决定背弃他对约瑟夫·斯大林的承诺，并以一次突然袭击入侵了苏联。这使得俄罗斯（正如你们在右下角的漫画中看到的）与其余盟国站在了一起。

那么我们是如何走向战争的呢？我们已经非常接近了。罗斯福决定通过盟军护航系统进一步援助盟国。美国开始护送租借物资横渡大西洋。德国潜艇使横渡大西洋的航行非常危险，而美国实际上正在确保装备运往英国等国家。这实际上是对德国的一场未宣之战，因为罗斯福授权如果看到德国船只就开火——开火！

一次重要的会议召开，称为大西洋会议。富兰克林·罗斯福与丘吉尔在新foundland海岸秘密会面，他们制定了一份名为《大西洋宪章》的文件。这份文件实际上只不过是战后世界的目标。它呼吁民族自决、自由贸易、不因这场战争而获取领土。应该建立一个新的集体安全组织——不再是国际联盟——而是更好的东西。以及其他事项。

然而，美国加入第二次世界大战并非源于欧洲的事件。实际上，将我们卷入这场战争的是我们与日本的冲突。快速回顾：记住，美国是唯一试图阻止日本扩张到亚洲的国家。他们从1932年的满洲开始。罗斯福为了回应（实际上始于1937年的）对中国的全面战争，下令对日本实施禁运。

记住日本是一个岛国，所以他们的资源有限。罗斯福因此禁运而切断了钢铁等物资的贸易。由于他们自身的领土野心，日本于1941年7月占领了法属印度支那（实际上是越南、泰国等地）。事实上，你们可以在地图上看到日本领土每年都在扩张。罗斯福下令冻结所有日本在美资产并禁止石油销售。

日本急需这些石油资源，也想解冻他们在美国的资产，因此美日之间进行了谈判。但在谈判进行期间，1941年12月7日，日本秘密袭击了美国在夏威夷的珍珠港。那次袭击将永远被称为“永载史册的耻辱之日”。

Here's the properly punctuated and formatted version with corrections and proper use of double hyphens for dashes:

[Music]
What's going down, internet people? Today we're taking a look at the path -- the road to World War II. We're also looking at Franklin Roosevelt's foreign policy between the years of 1932 to 1941.

And to start off, it's really key that you understand that Roosevelt's going to do a few things differently than previous presidents. For example, he is going to open up formal recognition of the Soviet Union. Up until Roosevelt, ever since the Russian Revolution happened during World War I, the US had not opened up diplomatic relations. And Roosevelt is doing this for a number of reasons: one, he's worried about the growing power of Germany, and more importantly he's really interested in possible trade with Soviet Union.

Roosevelt's going to attempt to improve the relations with Latin America. If you recall, there were all sorts of US interventions in Latin American countries, and he is going to adopt something called The Good Neighbor policy which he announces in his inaugural address. Couple of examples of things he's actually going to do: the Marines are going to leave Haiti in 1934. In Cuba, he's going to get rid of the Platt Amendment which said the US can intervene. We are going to keep the base at Guantanamo. And other things trying to kind of patch things up between us and our Southern homies.

In 1934, the Reciprocal Trade Agreement is going to be put into effect. And this is a reduction of US tariffs if other countries do the same. In fact, for a very long time tariffs were extremely high and they really ruined international trade. They had been high ever since really the Civil War. They were increased -- remember the Hawley-Smoot Tariff -- and foreign trade had decreased. So this plan basically said if other nations reciprocate a reduction in tariffs, the US would do the same.

However, the bulk of this video is going to be about World War II, and you can't understand that without the rise of totalitarianism. And what was happening is all sorts of regimes really in the 1920s and also in the 30s are going to emerge. And what all these regimes have in common is the ultimate power was in the hands of the state in the government.

So for example, in 1922 in Italy, Mussolini and the fascist party comes to power. In the Soviet Union, you have the rise of Joseph Stalin. In Germany, you have the rise of the Nazi party -- Adolf Hitler is elected in 1933. And in Japan, a militaristic government comes to power, and really in 1941 you have Hideki Tojo as the leader. And all of these different governments start pursuing different policies that militarize their countries and seek to expand their borders.

And a couple of examples occur in 1931: Japan conquers Manchuria which is a huge threat to the open door policy of the United States. And Japan also withdraws from the League of Nations and begins to build up their navy. Italy's also going to make some moves -- in 1935 they're going to attack Ethiopia. And in all of these examples, the League of Nations does nothing to intervene.

Now how are these threats responded to back home in America? And the reality is many Americans were disillusioned with their participation in World War I. In fact, there was a commission setup called the Nye Commission in 1934 -- not that guy, this guy. And what the commission decided in their investigation was that the real cause of American involvement in World War I was the result of American bankers and arms manufacturers. They caused our entry -- it wasn't so much the German submarines sinking ships, it was really the desire of these groups to make money.

And the findings of the Nye Commission and the general feeling of the American public -- remember we're going through the Great Depression -- leads many Americans to support US neutrality. In fact, Congress passes a series of laws to guarantee the US would stay out of a potential conflict in Europe. And you could see that in this political cartoon. These laws are known as the Neutrality Acts. There are various acts passed in 1935, 1936 and 1937, and the whole purpose of them was to keep us out of a potential conflict.

Couple of examples: in 1935 the Neutrality Act said no American citizen could sail on the ships of belligerent nations -- so nations that were at war, US citizens were forbidden from traveling on those ships. Remember what happened with the Lusitania -- they want to avoid things like that. The Neutrality Acts also outlawed the sales of arms or weapons to countries that are at war -- once again trying to keep us out of a potential conflict. And the Neutrality Acts also outlawed the giving of loans to nations at war.

Important to note is the US could not help out even if a country was the innocent victim of aggression. So when Japan attacks China, the US cannot provide them any help. Now Roosevelt was reluctant to sign these into law, but the sentiment of the United States was to preserve our neutrality to ensure it at all cost.

Now the policy of appeasement is really not going to work -- it's going to backfire. And you're going to see that happening in a series of events that take place. You know in Spain there is a civil war -- the fascist government of Francisco Franco is going to attack and eventually overthrow the loyalist government. In fact, Francisco Franco is getting aid by Hitler and Mussolini. And from 1936 to 1939, eventually that civil war ends and a military dictatorship is put into place. And the neutrality laws keep the US from sending weapons to help the loyalist government.

Hitler is going to openly violate the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, there's a whole bunch of examples of this: he occupies the Rhineland in 1936 -- it was supposed to be demilitarized. He starts to build up the German military. He annexes Austria in 1938. And then he demands a piece of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland. In the Sudetenland there was a large German-speaking population, and Hitler claims they need to be a part of the German nation.

In response to Hitler's demands for the Sudetenland, there is a meeting called the Munich Conference where the leaders -- really England is taking a lead role here -- they agreed to hand over the Sudetenland to Germany. Hitler must promise that this will be the last of his territorial demands, and he does promise that -- that's it if he gets it. And this is known as the policy of appeasement.

Really though, it's important to keep in mind the Munich Conference comes to symbolize the failed policy of appeasement because just 6 months later, Hitler is going to take over the rest of Czechoslovakia -- going back on his word at Munich.

Events are not just looking bad in Europe. In fact, Japan invades the rest of China in 1937. Because of the neutrality laws, Roosevelt is unable to help China. He does issue a kind of quarantine notice. And really once again, Japan's invasion of China is seen as a threat to the open door policy of the United States. And once again tensions are running high. In fact, Japan sinks a US gunboat called the Panay and quickly apologizes so to avoid war between Japan and the US.

So how does this war begin? Well, Germany and the Soviet Union shocked the world when they signed a non-aggression pact in August of 1939. They agree that they're not going to attack one another -- creepy image right there of Stalin and Hitler getting married. And this allows Hitler to attack Poland without having to worry about a two-front war -- he doesn't have to worry about the Soviets or possibly England or France on the other side. Hitler and Stalin secretly agreed to divide Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union.

England and France finally take a stand. They recognize that appeasement was failing and they pledged to defend Poland. And on September 1st, 1939, Germany invades Poland. And very quickly France and England declare war. And this is the beginning of World War II -- it will last from 1939 to 1945.

But what you need to realize is very quickly -- in fact by June of 1940 -- Hitler had quickly conquered most of Europe with his Blitzkrieg or lightning war. All those you see in the light yellow color were controlled by the Axis powers by 1942.

The United States remains neutral, but it's important to understand that in spite of this neutrality, they do not want the Axis powers to win. The dilemma for Roosevelt is how do we help the Allies while also preserving our neutrality? And what you're going to see is there is a real prospect of Hitler taking over all of Europe. France falls relatively quickly.

And as a result, Congress amends the neutrality legislation. And this is the Neutrality Act of 1939. This is a shift and amendment to the previous laws, and it says this: countries could buy weapons as long as they paid for them in cash and they carried them in their own ships. This is the cash and carry provision. What this does is it lifts the arms embargo and allows the United States to help out countries that were the victims of Axis power aggression.

However, there were severe limits to this because many countries did not have enough cash available, nor did they have the ability to carry weapons from the United States to help them fight the nations of Japan, Italy or Germany. In fact, China is completely unable to take advantage of the cash and carry act. With this revision, you have to really think about -- are we really neutral? We are trying to help out the Allies while also maintaining as much neutrality as possible.

Well, in spite of the cash and carry act, by June of 1940 most of France is defeated -- there's Hitler's selfie in front of the Eiffel Tower. In September of 1940, the United States adopts the first peacetime draft to get ready for a potential conflict. And in August of 1940, you have the Battle of Britain taking place in which Germany begins bombing England, preparing for a potential invasion of England.

US involvement increases. In fact, there's a huge debate as England is getting bombed about what we are going to do -- what policy we're going to pursue. And you have some people joining groups such as the Committee to Defend America. They advocated helping England and the Allies, and the reason was if we help out England, this would help America by avoiding a conflict coming to our shores.

Another group you should know about is the America First Committee. They opposed US involvement -- Charles Lindbergh was one of their speakers -- and they were staunch isolationists. They did not want the United States to get involved at all. In fact, they opposed any amendments to the Neutrality Acts.

As England was struggling in its fight against Germany, another plan is adopted called the Destroyers for Bases in September of 1940. The program said the US would give England US destroyers -- old ships -- in exchange for military bases in the Western Hemisphere. And this was a win for England -- they needed get some ships, and this was Roosevelt's way of helping out England without once again actually doing the fighting.

In that same year in 1940, Roosevelt breaks the two-term tradition of Washington and wins an unprecedented third term. In fact, Republicans criticize him for running for a third term. But there's this belief that we want a trusted leader to lead the nation during this time of crisis.

And one of the big things that Roosevelt had to address in his third term was the fact that England was barely holding on against German attacks. In fact, the leader at the time Winston Churchill -- I like to imagine a fictional conversation: "We need help! Damn Neutrality Acts!" Roosevelt would say, "Help? I have a plan." And that plan was this -- it's called the Lend-Lease Act.

And the Lend-Lease Act is really a result of Roosevelt worried about the threat of an Axis power victory. And so the Lend-Lease bill was passed in March of 1941, and it eliminated the cash and carry requirements. And it said the US would send supplies to countries that were the victim of aggression. And the justification for this program was this: by being the "great arsenal of democracy" (Roosevelt called it), the US would avoid having to fight.

Roosevelt likened the Lend-Lease Act to a neighbor giving a hose to one of his neighbors when their house was on fire. And at the end of the war, the idea would be the used weapons or equivalent items would be sent back to the United States. There's no question now that the US was not truly neutral -- we are openly siding with the British and the other Allies. This by many accounts is an economic declaration of war against the Axis powers. And as US factories shift to all-out war production, the Great Depression is effectively over.

And a bad move occurs on June 22nd, 1941 -- Operation Barbarossa. Hitler decides to go back on his pledge with Joseph Stalin and he invades the Soviet Union with a sneak attack. And what this does is it puts Russia (as you can see in the bottom right cartoon) into the bed with the rest of the Allies.

So how do we get to war? We're so close. Well, Roosevelt decides to further his assistance to the Allied Powers with the Allied convoy system. The US begins escorting the Lend-Lease supplies across the Atlantic Ocean. German U-boats made traveling the Atlantic very dangerous, and the US is actually making sure that equipment gets to countries such as England. And this is really an undeclared war against Germany because Roosevelt gives the authority to shoot on sight if you see German ships -- fire!

An important meeting takes place called the Atlantic Conference. FDR meets Churchill secretly off the coast of Newfoundland, and they developed something called the Atlantic Charter. And this document is really nothing more than the goals for the post-war world. It calls for self-determination, free trade, no territorial gains as a result of this war. There should be a new collective security organization -- no more League of Nations -- something better. And other things.

However, US entry into World War II will not come as a result of events in Europe. It's actually going to be our beef with Japan that'll bring us into this war. Quick reminder: remember the US was alone in trying to check Japanese expansion into Asia. They start with Manchuria in 1932. And Roosevelt in response to all-out war against China (which really begins in 1937) orders an embargo against Japan.

Remember Japan is an island nation, so their resources are limited. And Roosevelt shuts off trade of things like steel and iron as a result of this embargo. And also because of their own territorial desires, Japan occupies French Indochina (really Vietnam, Thailand and so on) in July of 1941. In fact, you could see the expansion of Japanese territory each year on that map. Roosevelt orders all Japanese assets frozen and a ban on oil sales.

Japan desperate for these oil resources and also wanting to unfreeze their assets in the United States enters into negotiations between the US and Japan. But as those negotiations are ongoing, Japan secretly attacks the United States on December 7th, 1941 at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. And that attack will forever be known as "a day which will live in infamy."
