== 释义


what’s going down 发生什么事 history people? today we’re going to take a look at our first national government the Articles of Confederation 联邦条例. + 
 we’re going to see how it failed, where it did have some success, and ultimately why was it replaced by the new federal government under the Constitution 宪法. + 
 now before we get into any national governments, one thing you need to keep in mind is all of the 13 colonies upon independence had to create their own state governments. + 
 so each state is going to set up its own written plan of government under state constitution 州宪法. + 
 and they’re gonna look very different depending upon which state you focus on. + 


now they do share some characteristics, and one of those things is a separation of powers 权力分立. + 
 power was typically split between three branches of government: the legislative branch 立法部门, executive branch 行政部门, and the judicial branch 司法部门. + 
 and most of the power in many of the states was in the legislative branch. + 
 they were worried about centralized power 中央集权 especially in the executive branch so no two powerful governors in these states. + 
 the whole idea of separation of powers was to safeguard 保障 the liberties that they are fighting for and eventually will win with the American Revolution. + 


some states had different property requirements 财产要求. + 
 these were typical for voter eligibility 选民资格. + 
 in fact, many states maintain property qualifications in order to vote. + 
 in other words, if you were a white male (sorry only white males are able to vote in the new nation), if you were a white male you had to have property in order to be able to vote. + 
 so the American Revolution didn’t change that reality in many states (some states it did). + 
 many states included Bill of Rights 权利法案 that outline basic freedoms in the state constitution: so freedom of religion 宗教自由, trial by jury 陪审团审判, and other rights that they were worried might be taken away by too powerful of a government. + 


in fact, one state in particular, Virginia, created the statue for religious freedom by Thomas Jefferson. + 
 this was passed by the Virginian assembly 议会 and it D established the Church of England, provided religious freedom for all, including Jews and Catholics who typically were ignored when we talked about religious freedom. + 
 and Jefferson was very proud of this accomplishment way before the Bill of Rights or the First Amendment 第一修正案 establishing religious freedom. + 


now important to keep in mind is all these different state governments, no matter what their different rules were, they were set up based upon the idea of republicanism 共和主义. + 
 and this meant power comes from the people and it’s based upon consent 同意. + 
 however, there would be debates over what republicanism would look like in the new nation. + 
 and as I said, some states maintain property qualifications for voting while others abolish 废除 them. + 


during the American Revolution, our first national government is set up under the Articles of Confederation. + 
 this is the first national government of the United States. + 
 it’s drafted 起草 by John Dickinson during the American Revolution. + 
 he actually submits it in 1777 during the fighting, but it took some time to ratify 批准 because the different states were disputing who controlled land out in the West. + 
 there was all sorts of arguments and it’s not formally ratified until 1781. + 


now this government it could conduct foreign policy 外交政策, it could borrow money, it could make treaties 条约. + 
 sounds like a lot of power right there. + 
 however, it’s extremely important to keep in mind under the Articles of Confederation the government was weak. + 
 it had limited power and they did that intentionally because of their experiences with King George and Parliament 议会 and their experiences with England in general. + 


so some examples of the weaknesses: it had a unicameral Congress 一院制议会 (unicameral meaning one house only one house). + 
 there’s no executive branch (no president, no prime minister). + 
 in fact there’s no court system. + 
 so no executive branch to enforce the laws. + 
 it has no power to tax 征税. + 
 the Articles of Confederation gave the government no power to tax, and that’s going to be a big problem. + 
 and it could not regulate trade 规范贸易 between different states. + 


some other problems under the Articles of Confederation include: it took nine votes out of 13 to pass laws (that mean nine states out of thirteen way more than a majority needed to agree to pass any laws). + 
 all states regardless of size had one vote. + 
 so the most populated state Virginia had the same amount of representation as a smaller state such as Rhode Island. + 
 and if you want it to change the Articles of Confederation to amend 修正 it, all thirteen states must agree in order to make any changes, and that’s nearly impossible. + 


big thing that happens is under the Articles of Confederation financial problems plagued 困扰 the young nation. + 
 there was a large debt as a result of the American Revolution. + 
 paper money was being printed and it was worthless. + 
 there’s no ability to tax and you had to rely on the states to just send money to the government, and it’s not going to work out very well. + 


in spite of these challenges, there is some things the Articles do well, and that’s really seen in the northwest ordinances 西北法令. + 
 one of the biggest accomplishments of the Articles of Confederation. + 
 the first one is the land ordinance of 1785, and it established the principle that territories could become States as their populations grew. + 
 and we’re really talking about this territory right in here: the old northwest. + 
 and the US government under the Articles would sell the land in order to raise money and pay off the debt. + 


under the land ordinance of 1785, it sets up a system for surveying 测量 the land and selling that land in the northwest. + 
 so they would survey the land as you can see right here. + 
 they would divide it up into townships 镇区. + 
 and an important part of the ordinance of 1785 was that one section of the land would be set aside for public education 公共教育. + 
 and this was a pretty progressive idea at the time for the government to be setting aside land for public edie. + 


and then finally, the third law under the Northwest ordinances is the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. + 
 this set up the system for territories to enter the union as new States. + 
 and you could see the five states that will eventually be created out of this chunk of territory. + 
 it said once a territory reached 60,000 residents, they could petition 申请 to become a state, and they could become a state and they would be equal to the existing states. + 
 but under the ordinance of 1787, they did something: they banned slavery north of the Ohio River in this territory. + 
 and this is obviously going to lead to further divisions between the north and the south as time goes on. + 


in this early period, the United States is going to face many threats, many foreign policy problems from a variety of sources. + 
 and one is our old mama England. + 
 in fact, England was building forts 堡垒 in this territory. + 
 remember they still occupied Canada. + 
 they’re building forts in the old Northwest. + 
 they’re supposed to remove those forts they don’t. + 
 there is disruptions in trade between the United States and England. + 
 and they’re giving weapons to the Native Americans in this region which is very often then being used on Americans in the frontier 边疆. + 
 so there’s a lot of problems in tensions continuing between the US and England. + 


another problem came from Spain when in 1784 they banned American shipping 航运 along the Mississippi River. + 
 they basically shut off the Port of New Orleans right over here, and this is a huge problem because this is basically the highway that trade traveled on. + 
 and really if you look at this map, roughly half of the territory of the United States was really not firmly in their control. + 


we’re also going to have some problems with our former allies France. + 
 they start demanding repayment of loans 贷款 that they had given us during the American Revolution. + 
 and eventually they’re going to have their own revolution: the French Revolution, which is going to cause a lot of problems later on. + 


then lastly, you’ll never believe it but pirates 海盗 also were causing problems for the United States in this early period. + 
 the Barbary pirates were over here in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea and in this area, and they start harassing 骚扰 American shipping. + 
 previous to this period we had the protection of the powerful British Navy since there are mama, and now that we’re free we have to do our fighting on our own, and we’re not equipped to deal with these multiple threats. + 
 so you have all these foreign policy problems for the young nation. + 


then you have threats from within, and that really could be seen with Shaye’s rebellion 谢斯起义. + 
 recall following the American Revolution, the economy suffered a post-war depression 战后萧条. + 
 the economy is doing really poorly. + 
 the money’s worth nothing, and particularly hard-hit were farmers. + 
 since the Articles of Confederation can’t tax, the debt is growing, and many states are printing paper money that is basically worthless. + 


as a result of these problems, you have something called Shay’s rebellion sparking in 1786. + 
 and Daniel shade (the guy who the rebellion is named after) is a veteran 老兵 of the American Revolution, and he’s a farmer in Massachusetts, and he leads a rebellion of poor farmers in the state of Massachusetts. + 
 many of these farmers were seeing their farms foreclosed 丧失抵押品赎回权 (they were taken over by the bank), and in order to deal with this they start organizing. + 
 they have some demands: they want lower taxes, they want the end of foreclosures (they don’t want their farms taking over), they want the printing of paper money so that they can help pay their debts off easier, and they also want the end of imprisonment for debt 债务监禁 (you could actually go to jail if you didn’t pay your bills back then). + 


these farmers don’t get their demands met, and they begin to organize into mobs 暴民 that stop the collection of taxes. + 
 they start closing down the courts where the debtors were being put on trial, and there’s even a mob of farmers that try to seize 夺取 the weapons from the armory 军械库 where all the guns are kept. + 


now here’s the thing about Shay’s rebellion: the government under the Articles of Confederation was too weak to put the rebellion down. + 
 so these farmers are not paying their taxes, they’re shutting down the court systems, and the government really can’t put this rebellion down. + 
 and you can see it’s happening throughout the state of Massachusetts. + 


eventually a militia 民兵 breaks up the rebellion, and Shay’s rebellion kind of fades away. + 
 but what’s important about this (and make sure you know it) is it increased calls for a stronger central government. + 
 there’s a real fear amongst the propertied classes 有产阶级 (the moneyed) that this rebellion is a sign of things to come, and we need a strong government to deal with these potential rebellions. + 


another important thing about Shay’s rebellion is it reveals tensions between those people in the back country (those people out in the frontier) and the people that are on the East Coast (the more wealthy, the more property, the more money). + 


following chase rebellions, some people wanted a new government to be formed, and there was a growing demand that something be done to address the problems facing the nation under the Articles of Confederation. + 
 you can see in the blue some of the things we’ve already mentioned. + 


there is a meeting in 1786 at Annapolis. + 
 it’s called the Annapolis convention 安纳波利斯会议. + 
 only five states attend to discuss trade and commerce. + 
 it’s not a really successful meeting in terms of accomplishing anything, but two people at the meeting (Alexander Hamilton and James Madison) agree we’re going to meet up again in Philadelphia in one year, and that’s exactly what they do, and this event becomes the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议 in 1787. + 


the purpose of the meeting was for revising the articles. + 
 in fact, the 55 delegates 代表 who go there sent for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation. + 
 they’re going there with the plan that we’re going to fix this thing and make it a little bit better. + 
 12 States show up at the Constitutional Convention (no Rhode Island). + 
 you got some all-stars you can see him in that painting: you got George Washington (he’s the president of the convention), Ben Franklin’s in the house at 81 years old, and you got a whole bunch of other people. + 


and what they decide (these 55 delegates) is they very quickly decided to create an entirely new stronger central government. + 
 they’re going to get rid of the Articles of Confederation and replace it with a new federal government. + 


interesting to note who’s not there: Thomas Jefferson is over in Europe, so is John Adams, and some of the more radical members of the American Revolution (Patrick Henry, Sam Adams) they are suspicious of this group, and they’re really worried about the formation of a more powerful government. + 
 but they’re doing it anyhow. + 


and so here’s what happens: they do need to make a lot of compromises 妥协 at the Constitutional Convention. + 
 there’s a lot of disagreements (make sure you know about them), and the biggie is about representation in Congress: how were they going to determine the number of people who are elected into Congress per state? and there’s a lot riding on this decision because the more votes the more power. + 


remember under the Articles, every state had one vote regardless of size, and you can see on the map you got 13 states and they have wildly different levels of population. + 


James Madison introduced his plan called the Virginia Plan 弗吉尼亚方案 (oftentimes kind of referred to as the large state plan), and this said we should set up a bicameral 两院制 (two house) legislature 立法机构 and representation would be based on population (meaning the more people you have living in the state, the more people you would get that would be able to serve in Congress). + 
 clearly if you’re a small state you don’t like this plan. + 


and they had their own plan (sometimes referred to as the New Jersey Plan 新泽西方案), and this was favored by small states. + 
 they say let’s have a unicameral legislature (one house), and each state would have equal representation. + 


there’s a lot of tension over this issue, but luckily there’s a compromise. + 
 it’s called great compromise 大妥协 (introduced by Roger Sherman, sometimes referred to as the Connecticut plan), and here’s what they do: they’re going to take elements of both plans. + 
 you’re going to have a bicameral legislature (so you’re going to have a two house). + 
 the upper house (the Senate 参议院): two representatives per state (so it didn’t matter how big or small your state was, you’re going to get two senators). + 
 and in the lower house (the House of Representatives 众议院), the representation would be based upon population (so the more people living in the state, the more people you get to elect). + 


while they solve the population issue, another issue kind of hovered over the Constitutional Convention, and that has to do with slavery. + 
 there was a debate over whether slaves should be counted in the state population. + 
 southerners said yes you should count our slaves so we can get more representatives. + 
 northerners say no you don’t give them any political or social or economic rights so the answer is no. + 


they come up with a very controversial compromise called the three-fifths compromise 五分之三妥协, and basically what it said: slaves would be counted as three-fifths of a person when deciding representation in the House of Reps. + 
 so each slave would count as three-fifths, and by doing so this adds more representatives in the House of Reps for southern states which tended to have large slave populations. + 


another agreement surrounding the issue of slavery has to do with the slave trade: how much longer should we allow people to be forcibly brought to this new nation founded upon liberty and freedom and all that good stuff?  +
and at the convention they decide they’re going to allow the slave trade to continue until 1808. +
 and for another 20 years, slaves are allowed to be brought into the United States. + 


and then finally, although the word slave or slavery was not used in the Constitution, it’s important to note the institution of slavery was very much protected by the original document. + 
 they even have a Fugitive Slave Clause 逃奴条款 which is added which says if your slave runs away, you are able to reacquire your property and bring them back to your plantation or farm. + 


there’s other debates and conflicts at the Constitutional Convention, but eventually they create a document, and they have to figure out whether or not we’re going to ratify or approve it. + 
 the Constitution would only take effect if 9 out of 13 states ratified it, and there are going to be supporters and haters on both sides. + 


the Federalists 联邦党人 were those individuals who were the supporters of the Constitution, and they really favored a strong central government. + 


on the other end were the anti-federalists 反联邦党人 (people like Thomas Jefferson even though he was over in Europe). + 
 these were the critics of the Constitution, and they favored a weak central government. + 
 yes there were flaws with the Articles of Confederation, but this new government in their mind was giving too much power to the central government. + 
 and anti-federalists were very much opposed to ratification. + 
 they tended to favor state rights 州权. + 


you do have people trying to convince those who did not want ratification, and you could see this in the Federalist Papers 联邦党人文集. + 
 these are 85 essays largely written by James Madison and Hamilton, but you also got some by John Jay, and they were designed to persuade people to support ratification of the Constitution. + 


eventually the thing that helps get enough anti federalists to support ratification is the guarantee of a Bill of Rights that would be added to the Constitution. + 
 the first ten amendments 修正案 would be added later on, and the idea behind the Bill of Rights is it enumerated 列举 (it’s spelled out specifically) individual rights and explicitly restricted powers of the federal government. + 


and the new government will take effect in 1789 when George Washington takes office as the nation’s first president. + 


finally, some stuff you should know about the Constitution: the Constitution set up a government based upon popular sovereignty 人民主权, and this means power is in the hands of the people (they are the source of a government’s power). + 
 separation of powers between the three branches of government is very much a part of this constitutional system, and it’s important to note that the power of government is limited, and there are checks and balances 制衡 and a separation of powers embedded in this document. + 


another concept you should know about is the fact that the Constitution set up a division of power between the national and state governments. + 
 both the national and state governments have power, and this is the system known as federalism 联邦主义. + 
 but it’s also important to note that the federal government (the national government) ultimately has supremacy 至高无上 over the states. + 
 ratification meant the Constitution would be the supreme law of the land. + 


and lastly, under the Constitution, presidents would not be elected directly by the voters. + 
 in fact, the framers 制定者 of the Constitution wanted to limit excessive popular influence. + 
 they feared too much democracy would lead to mob rule 暴民统治. + 
 number these were men of property and money, so they created the Electoral College 选举人团 as the means of electing the President of the United States. + 


that’s going to do it. +

== 中文翻译


今天我们要回顾一下**我们的第一个国家政府——邦联条例。我们将了解它是如何失败的，它在哪些方面取得了一些成功，以及最终为什么它被宪法下的新联邦政府所取代。**现在，在我们深入了解任何国家政府之前，**你需要记住的一件事是，所有13个殖民地在独立后都必须建立自己的州政府。因此，每个州都将根据"州宪法", 来制定自己的书面政府计划。**而且，根据你关注的州的不同，它们看起来会非常不同。

**现在，##它们确实有一些共同的特征，其中之一就是"权力分立"。权力通常在政府的三个部门之间分配：立法部门、行政部门和司法部门。在许多州，大部分权力都掌握在"立法部门"手中。##他们担心权力过于集中，尤其是在行政部门，因此这些州没有过于强大的州长。**权力分立的整个想法, 是为了保障他们正在为之奋斗并将最终通过美国革命赢得的自由。

**一些州有不同的财产要求。这些是"选民资格"的典型要求。**事实上，许多州都保留了财产资格才能投票。换句话说，如果你是白人男性（抱歉，只有白人男性才能在新国家投票），**如果你是白人男性，你必须拥有财产, 才能投票。**因此，美国革命并没有改变许多州的这种现实（一些州确实改变了）。*许多州都在"州宪法"中包含了"权利法案"，其中概述了基本的自由：例如宗教自由、陪审团审判, 以及他们担心可能被过于强大的政府剥夺的其他权利。*

事实上，**有一个州特别值得一提，弗吉尼亚州，由托马斯·杰斐逊制定了"宗教自由"法令。该法令由弗吉尼亚州议会通过，它废除了英国国教的地位，为所有人提供了宗教自由，包括通常在谈论"宗教自由"时被忽视的犹太人和天主教徒。**杰斐逊对这项成就感到非常自豪，*这远早于确立宗教自由的权利法案或第一修正案。*

现在需要记住的重要一点是，**#所有这些不同的州政府，无论其规则如何不同，都是基于共和主义思想建立的。这意味着权力来自人民，并基于人民的同意。然而，对于共和主义在新国家中应该是什么样子，将会存在争论。#**正如我所说，一些州保留了投票的财产资格，而另一些州则废除了这些资格。

**在美国革命期间，我们的第一个国家政府是在"邦联条例"下建立的。这是美国第一个国家政府。**它由约翰·迪金森在美国革命期间起草。他实际上在1777年战斗期间提交了它，但由于各州在争夺西部土地的控制权，它花了相当长的时间才获得批准。当时存在各种各样的争论，直到1781年才正式获得批准。

**现在，这个政府可以进行外交政策，可以借钱，可以签订条约。**听起来权力很大，对吧？*然而，极其重要的是要记住，在邦联条例下，政府是软弱的。它的权力有限，他们这样做是故意的，因为他们有与乔治国王和议会, 以及他们与英国的整体经历有关的教训。*

*因此，一些弱点的例子包括：它有一个一院制的国会（一院制意味着只有一个议院）。没有行政部门（没有总统，没有首相）。事实上，没有法院系统。因此，没有行政部门来执行法律。它没有征税的权力。《邦联条例》没有赋予政府征税的权力，这将是一个大问题。而且，它无法 регулировать 各州之间的贸易。*

*《邦联条例》下的一些其他问题包括：要想通过法律, 需要13票中的9票（这意味着13个州中需要9个州同意, 才能通过任何法律，这远高于多数票）。所有州，无论大小，都只有一票。因此，人口最多的弗吉尼亚州, 与罗德岛这样的小州, 拥有相同的代表权。如果你想修改《邦联条例》，所有13个州都必须同意才能进行任何修改(比联合国五常还狠)，这几乎是不可能的。*

一件大事是，*##在《邦联条例》下，财政问题困扰着这个年轻的国家。##由于美国革命，债务巨大。纸币被大量印刷，变得一文不值。#政府没有征税的能力，只能依靠各州向政府拨款，但这并没有很好地运作。#*

尽管存在这些挑战，《邦联条例》在某些方面做得很好，这在西北法令中得到了充分体现。这是《邦联条例》最重要的成就之一。第一个是**1785年的土地法令，它确立了"领土可以随着人口增长, 而成为州"的原则。**我们真正谈论的是这片区域：旧西北地区。*根据《邦联条例》，美国政府将出售土地, 以筹集资金, 并偿还债务。*

**根据1785年的土地法令，**它建立了一个勘测和出售西北地区土地的系统。正如你在这里看到的，**他们会勘测土地，并将其划分为乡镇。**1785年法令的一个重要部分是，一块土地将被划拨用于公共教育。这在当时政府划拨土地用于公共教育方面, 是一个相当进步的想法。

最后，西北法令下的第三个法律, 是**1787年的西北法令。它为领土作为新州加入联邦, 制定了系统。**你可以看到, 最终将从这片领土中创建的五个州。*##它规定，一旦一个领土达到6万居民，他们就可以申请成为一个州，##并且他们可以成为一个州，并且与现有州平等。但在1787年的法令下，他们做了一件事：##他们禁止在俄亥俄河以北的这片领土上实行奴隶制。##随着时间的推移，这显然将导致南北之间进一步的分裂。*

在这个早期阶段，美国将面临来自各方面的许多威胁和许多外交政策问题。其中之一就是我们以前的“母亲”英国。*事实上，英国正在这片领土上修建堡垒。记住，他们仍然占领着加拿大。他们正在旧西北地区修建堡垒。他们本应拆除这些堡垒，但他们没有。美国和英国之间的贸易中断了。他们还向该地区的印第安人提供武器，这些武器经常被用来对付边境地区的美国人。因此，美国和英国之间持续存在许多问题和紧张关系。*

*另一个问题来自##西班牙，他们在1784年禁止美国船只沿密西西比河航行。他们基本上关闭了位于这里的New Orleans港口，这是一个巨大的问题，因为这基本上是贸易的交通要道。##如果你看看这张地图，#大约一半的美国领土实际上并没有被牢固地控制在他们的手中。#*

*我们与以前的盟友法国也将出现一些问题。他们开始要求偿还美国独立战争期间他们给予我们的贷款。最终他们将爆发自己的革命：法国大革命，这将导致后来的许多问题。*

最后，你可能难以置信，但海盗在这个早期也给美国制造麻烦。巴巴里海盗位于北非和地中海地区，他们开始骚扰美国船只。在此之前，我们受到强大的英国海军的保护，因为他们是我们的“母亲”，而现在我们自由了，我们必须自己战斗，我们没有能力应对这些多重威胁。因此，年轻的国家面临着所有这些外交政策问题。

然后是来自内部的威胁，这在谢司叛乱中可以清楚地看到。回想一下美国独立战争之后，经济遭受了战后萧条。经济状况非常糟糕，货币一文不值，农民尤其受到严重打击。由于邦联条例不能征税，债务不断增长，许多州都在印刷基本上毫无价值的纸币。

由于这些问题，1786年爆发了谢司叛乱。丹尼尔·谢司（叛乱以他的名字命名）是美国独立战争的老兵，也是马萨诸塞州的一位农民，他领导了马萨诸塞州贫困农民的叛乱。许多农民的农场被取消抵押品赎回权（被银行收回），为了应对这种情况，他们开始组织起来。他们提出了一些要求：他们要求降低税收，结束取消抵押品赎回权（他们不希望自己的农场被收回），他们要求印刷纸币以便更容易偿还债务，他们还要求结束因债务而入狱（当时如果你不还钱，你真的可能被关进监狱）。

这些农民的要求没有得到满足，他们开始组织成暴民，阻止税收的征收。他们开始关闭审判债务人的法院，甚至有一群农民试图从存放所有枪支的军械库夺取武器。

现在，关于谢司叛乱的关键在于：邦联条例下的政府过于软弱，无法镇压这场叛乱。因此，这些农民不缴纳税款，他们关闭了法院系统，而政府实际上无法镇压这场叛乱。你可以看到它发生在整个马萨诸塞州。

最终，一支民兵镇压了叛乱，谢司叛乱逐渐平息。但这件事的重要性在于（务必记住），它增加了对建立一个更强大的中央政府的呼声。有产阶级（富人）非常担心这场叛乱是未来局势的预兆，我们需要一个强大的政府来应对这些潜在的叛乱。

关于谢司叛乱的另一个重要之处在于，它揭示了内地居民（边疆地区的人）与东海岸居民（更富有、拥有更多财产和金钱的人）之间的紧张关系。

谢司叛乱之后，一些人希望建立一个新的政府，并且越来越多人要求采取行动解决国家在邦联条例下面临的问题。在蓝色部分，你可以看到我们已经提到的一些问题。

1786年在安纳波利斯举行了一次会议，称为安纳波利斯会议。只有五个州参加了会议，讨论贸易和商业问题。就达成任何成果而言，这不是一次非常成功的会议，但会议上的两个人（亚历山大·汉密尔顿和詹姆斯·麦迪逊）同意一年后在费城再次会面，他们也确实这样做了，这次事件成为了1787年的制宪会议。

会议的目的是修订邦联条例。事实上，前往那里的55名代表的唯一明确目的是修订邦联条例。他们带着要修复这个问题并使其变得更好一点的计划前往那里。12个州参加了制宪会议（罗德岛没有参加）。你可以看到在那幅画中出现了一些明星人物：乔治·华盛顿（他是会议主席）、81岁的本·富兰克林也在场，还有一大堆其他人。

他们（这55名代表）所决定的是，他们很快就决定创建一个全新的更强大的中央政府。他们将废除邦联条例，并用一个新的联邦政府取而代之。

值得注意的是谁没有出席：托马斯·杰斐逊在欧洲，约翰·亚当斯也在，一些更激进的美国革命成员（帕特里克·亨利、萨姆·亚当斯）对这个团体持怀疑态度，他们非常担心建立一个更强大的政府。但他们还是这样做了。

这就是发生的事情：他们在制宪会议上确实需要做出许多妥协。存在许多分歧（务必了解这些分歧），而最大的分歧是关于国会中的代表权问题：他们将如何确定每个州选入国会的人数？这个决定至关重要，因为选票越多，权力就越大。

记住，在邦联条例下，每个州无论大小都只有一票，你可以看到地图上有13个州，它们的人口数量差异很大。

詹姆斯·麦迪逊提出了他的弗吉尼亚方案（通常被称为大州方案），该方案认为我们应该建立一个两院制（两个议院）的立法机构，代表权将基于人口（这意味着一个州居住的人越多，它在国会中获得的席位就越多）。显然，如果你是一个小州，你不会喜欢这个方案。

他们也有自己的方案（有时被称为新泽西方案），这个方案受到小州的青睐。他们说让我们建立一个一院制立法机构（一个议院），每个州都拥有平等的代表权。

这个问题引发了许多紧张关系，但幸运的是，达成了一个妥协方案。它被称为“大妥协”（由罗杰·谢尔曼提出，有时被称为康涅狄格方案），其内容如下：他们将采纳两个方案的要素。你将拥有一个两院制立法机构（所以你将有两个议院）。上议院（参议院）：每个州两名代表（所以无论你的州大小如何，你都将获得两名参议员）。而在下议院（众议院），代表权将基于人口（所以一个州居住的人越多，你就能选举出更多的人）。

虽然他们解决了人口问题，但另一个问题仍然笼罩在制宪会议之上，那就是奴隶制问题。关于奴隶是否应该计入州人口存在争议。南方人说应该算上我们的奴隶，这样我们才能获得更多的代表。北方人说不，你们不给他们任何政治、社会或经济权利，所以答案是否定的。

他们达成了一个极具争议的妥协方案，称为“五分之三妥协”，其基本内容是：在决定众议院的代表人数时，奴隶将被视为五分之三的人。因此，每个奴隶将被计算为五分之三，这样做为南方各州增加了在众议院的代表人数，而南方各州往往拥有大量的奴隶人口。

围绕奴隶制问题的另一项协议与奴隶贸易有关：我们应该允许人们被强行带到这个建立在自由之上的新国家多久？在会议上，他们决定允许奴隶贸易持续到1808年。在接下来的20年里，奴隶仍然可以被带到美国。

最后，虽然宪法中没有使用“奴隶”或“奴隶制”这个词，但重要的是要注意，奴隶制机构在最初的文件中受到了极大的保护。他们甚至增加了一项《逃奴条款》，该条款规定，如果你的奴隶逃跑了，你可以重新获得你的财产并将他们带回你的种植园或农场。

制宪会议上还存在其他辩论和冲突，但最终他们创建了一份文件，他们必须决定是否批准这份文件。只有13个州中的9个州批准宪法，宪法才会生效，并且双方都会有支持者和反对者。

联邦党人是那些支持宪法的人，他们非常赞成一个强大的中央政府。

另一方面是反联邦党人（比如托马斯·杰斐逊，尽管他当时在欧洲）。这些人是宪法的批评者，他们赞成一个软弱的中央政府。是的，《邦联条例》存在缺陷，但在他们看来，这个新政府赋予了中央政府过多的权力。反联邦党人非常反对批准宪法。他们倾向于支持州权。

确实有人试图说服那些不愿批准宪法的人，你可以在《联邦党人文集》中看到这一点。《联邦党人文集》是85篇文章，主要由詹姆斯·麦迪逊和汉密尔顿撰写，但约翰·杰伊也写了一些，它们的目的是说服人们支持批准宪法。

最终，促使足够多的反联邦党人支持批准宪法的是保证将权利法案添加到宪法中。前十项修正案将在稍后添加，权利法案背后的想法是它列举（明确阐述）了个人权利，并明确限制了联邦政府的权力。

新政府将于1789年乔治·华盛顿就任美国第一任总统时生效。

最后，一些你应该了解的关于宪法的内容：宪法建立了一个基于人民主权的政府，这意味着权力掌握在人民手中（人民是政府权力的来源）。政府三个部门之间的权力分立是这个宪政体系的重要组成部分，重要的是要注意政府的权力是有限的，这份文件中嵌入了制衡和权力分立。

另一个你应该了解的概念是，宪法在国家政府和州政府之间建立了权力划分。国家政府和州政府都拥有权力，这个体系被称为联邦制。但同样重要的是要注意，联邦政府（国家政府）最终对各州拥有至高无上的权力。批准意味着宪法将成为国家的最高法律。

最后，根据宪法，总统不会由选民直接选举产生。事实上，宪法的制定者希望限制过度的民众影响。他们担心过度的民主会导致暴民统治。这些人大多是拥有财产和金钱的人，因此他们创建了选举团作为选举美国总统的方式。

what's going down history people today
we're going to take a look at our first
national government the Articles of
Confederation. we're going to see how it
failed, where it did have some success,
and ultimately why was it replaced by
the new federal government under the
Constitution. now before we get into any
national governments, one thing you need
to keep in mind is all of the 13
colonies upon independence had to create
their own state governments. so each
state is going to set up its own written
plan of government under state
constitution. and they're gonna look very
different depending upon which state you
focus on.

now they do share some
characteristics, and one of those things
is a separation of powers. power was
typically split between three branches
of government: the legislative branch,
executive branch, and the judicial branch.
and most of the power in many of the
states was in the legislative branch.
they were worried about centralized
power especially in the executive branch
so no two powerful governors in these
states. the whole idea of separation of
powers was to safeguard the liberties
that they are fighting for and
eventually will win with the American
Revolution.

some states had different
property requirements. these were typical
for voter eligibility. in fact, many
states maintain property qualifications
in order to vote. in other words, if you
were a white male (sorry
only white males are able to vote in the
new nation), if you were a white male you
had to have property in order to be able
to vote. so the American Revolution
didn't change that reality in many
states (some states it did). many states
included Bill of Rights that outline
basic freedoms in the state constitution:
so freedom of religion, trial by jury, and
other rights that they were worried
might be taken away by too powerful of a
government.

in fact, one state in
particular, Virginia, created the statue
for religious freedom by Thomas
Jefferson. this was passed by the
Virginian assembly and it D established
the Church of England,
provided religious freedom for all,
including Jews and Catholics who
typically were ignored when we talked
about religious freedom. and Jefferson
was very proud of this accomplishment
way before the Bill of Rights or the
First Amendment establishing religious
freedom.

now important to keep in mind is
all these different state governments, no
matter what their different rules were,
they were set up based upon the idea of
republicanism. and this meant power comes
from the people and it's based upon
consent. however, there would be debates
over what republicanism would look like
in the new nation. and as I said, some
states maintain property qualifications
for voting while others abolish them.

during the American Revolution, our first
national government is set up under the
Articles of Confederation. this is the
first national government of the United
States. it's drafted by John Dickinson
during the American Revolution. he
actually submits it in 1777 during the
fighting, but it took some time to ratify
because the different states were
disputing who controlled land out in the
West. there was all sorts of arguments
and it's not formally ratified until
1781.

now this government it could
conduct foreign policy, it could borrow
money, it could make treaties. sounds like
a lot of power right there. however, it's
extremely important to keep in mind
under the Articles of Confederation the
government was weak. it had limited power
and they did that intentionally because
of their experiences with King George
and Parliament and their experiences
with England in general.

so some examples
of the weaknesses: it had a unicameral
Congress (unicameral meaning one house
only one house). there's no executive
branch (no president, no prime minister). in
fact there's no court system. so no
executive branch to enforce the laws. it
has no power to tax. the Articles of
Confederation gave the government no
power to tax, and that's going to be a
big problem. and it could not regulate
trade between different states.

some
other problems under the Articles of
Confederation include: it took nine votes
out of 13 to pass laws (that mean nine
states out of thirteen way
more than a majority needed to agree to
pass any laws). all states regardless of
size had one vote. so the most populated
state Virginia had the same amount of
representation as a smaller state such
as Rhode Island. and if you want it to
change the Articles of Confederation to
amend it, all thirteen states must agree
in order to make any changes, and that's
nearly impossible.

big thing that happens
is under the Articles of Confederation
financial problems plagued the young
nation. there was a large debt as a
result of the American Revolution. paper
money was being printed and it was
worthless. there's no ability to tax and
you had to rely on the states to just
send money to the government, and it's
not going to work out very well.

in spite of these challenges, there is some things
the Articles do well, and that's really
seen in the northwest ordinances. one of
the biggest accomplishments of the
Articles of Confederation. the first one
is the land ordinance of 1785, and it
established the principle that
territories could become States as their
populations grew. and we're really
talking about this territory right in
here: the old northwest. and the US
government under the Articles would sell
the land in order to raise money and pay
off the debt.

under the land ordinance of
1785, it sets up a system for surveying
the land and selling that land in the
northwest. so they would survey the land
as you can see right here. they would
divide it up into townships. and an
important part of the ordinance of 1785
was that one section of the land would
be set aside for public education. and
this was a pretty progressive idea at
the time for the government to be
setting aside land for public edie.

and then finally, the third law under the
Northwest ordinances is the Northwest
Ordinance of 1787. this set up the system
for territories to enter the union as
new States. and you could see the five
states that will eventually be created
out of this chunk of territory. it said
once a territory reached 60,000
residents, they could petition to become
a state, and they could become a state
and they would be
equal to the existing states. but under
the ordinance of 1787, they did something:
they banned slavery north of the Ohio
River in this territory. and this is
obviously going to lead to further
divisions between the north and the
south as time goes on.

in this early
period, the United States is going to
face many threats, many foreign policy
problems from a variety of sources. and
one is our old mama England. in fact,
England was building forts in this
territory. remember they still occupied
Canada. they're building forts in the old
Northwest. they're supposed to remove
those forts they don't. there is
disruptions in trade between the United
States and England. and they're giving
weapons to the Native Americans in this
region which is very often then being
used on Americans in the frontier. so
there's a lot of problems in tensions
continuing between the US and England.

another problem came from Spain when in
1784 they banned American shipping along
the Mississippi River. they basically
shut off the Port of New Orleans right
over here, and this is a huge problem
because this is basically the highway
that trade traveled on. and really if you
look at this map, roughly half of the
territory of the United States was
really not firmly in their control.

we're
also going to have some problems with
our former allies France. they start
demanding repayment of loans that they
had given us during the American
Revolution. and eventually they're going
to have their own revolution: the French
Revolution, which is going to cause a lot
of problems later on.

then lastly, you'll
never believe it
but pirates also were causing problems
for the United States in this early
period. the Barbary pirates were over
here in North Africa and the
Mediterranean Sea and in this area, and
they start harassing American shipping.
previous to this period we had the
protection of the powerful British Navy
since there are mama, and now that we're
free we have to do our fighting on our
own, and we're not equipped to deal with
these multiple threats. so you have all
these foreign policy problems for the
young nation.

then you have threats from
within, and that really could be seen
with Shaye's
rebellion. recall following the American
Revolution, the economy suffered a
post-war depression. the economy is doing
really poorly. the money's worth nothing,
and particularly hard-hit were farmers.
since the Articles of Confederation
can't tax, the debt is growing, and many
states are printing paper money that is
basically worthless.

as a result of these
problems, you have something called
Shay's rebellion sparking in 1786. and
Daniel shade (the guy who the rebellion
is named after) is a veteran of the
American Revolution, and he's a farmer in
Massachusetts, and he leads a rebellion
of poor farmers in the state of
Massachusetts. many of these farmers were
seeing their farms foreclosed (they were
taken over by the bank), and in order to
deal with this they start organizing.
they have some demands: they want lower
taxes, they want the end of foreclosures
(they don't want their farms taking over),
they want the printing of paper money so
that they can help pay their debts off
easier, and they also want the end of
imprisonment for debt (you could actually
go to jail if you didn't pay your bills
back then).

these farmers don't get their
demands met, and they begin to organize
into mobs that stop the collection of
taxes. they start closing down the courts
where the debtors were being put on
trial, and there's even a mob of farmers
that try to seize the weapons from the
armory where all the guns are kept.

now
here's the thing about Shay's rebellion:
the government under the Articles of
Confederation was too weak to put the
rebellion down. so these farmers are not
paying their taxes, they're shutting down
the court systems, and the government
really can't put this rebellion down. and
you can see it's happening throughout
the state of Massachusetts.

eventually a
militia breaks up the rebellion, and
Shay's rebellion kind of fades away. but
what's important about this (and make
sure you know it) is it increased calls for
a stronger central government. there's a
real fear amongst the propertied classes
(the moneyed) that this rebellion is a
sign of things to come, and we need a
strong government to deal with these
potential rebellions.

another important
thing about Shay's rebellion is it
reveals tensions between those people in
the back
country (those people out in the frontier)
and the people that are on the East
Coast (the more wealthy, the more property,
the more money).

following chase
rebellions, some people wanted a new
government to be formed, and there was a
growing demand that something be done to
address the problems facing the nation
under the Articles of Confederation. you
can see in the blue some of the things
we've already mentioned.

there is a
meeting in 1786 at Annapolis. it's called
the Annapolis convention. only five
states attend to discuss trade and
commerce. it's not a really successful
meeting in terms of accomplishing
anything, but two people at the meeting
(Alexander Hamilton and James Madison)
agree we're going to meet up again in
Philadelphia in one year, and that's
exactly what they do, and this event
becomes the Constitutional Convention in
1787.

the purpose of the meeting was for
revising the articles. in fact, the 55
delegates who go there sent for the sole
and express purpose of revising the
Articles of Confederation. they're going
there with the plan that we're going to
fix this thing and make it a little bit
better. 12 States show up at the
Constitutional Convention (no Rhode
Island). you got some all-stars you can
see him in that painting: you got George
Washington (he's the president of the
convention), Ben Franklin's in the house
at 81 years old, and you got a whole
bunch of other people.

and what they
decide (these 55 delegates) is they very
quickly decided to create an entirely
new stronger central government. they're
going to get rid of the Articles of
Confederation and replace it with a new
federal government.

interesting to note
who's not there: Thomas Jefferson is over
in Europe, so is John Adams, and some of
the more radical members of the American
Revolution (Patrick Henry, Sam Adams) they
are suspicious of this group, and they're
really worried about the formation of a
more powerful government. but they're
doing it anyhow.

and so here's what
happens: they do need to make a lot of
compromises at the Constitutional
Convention. there's a lot of
disagreements (make sure you know about
them), and the biggie is about
representation
in Congress: how were they going to
determine the number of people who are
elected into Congress per state? and
there's a lot riding on this decision
because the more votes the more power.

remember under the Articles, every state
had one vote regardless of size, and you
can see on the map you got 13 states and
they have wildly different levels of
population.

James Madison introduced his
plan called the Virginia Plan (oftentimes
kind of referred to as the large state
plan), and this said we should set up a
bicameral (two house) legislature and
representation would be based on
population (meaning the more people you
have living in the state, the more people
you would get that would be able to
serve in Congress). clearly if you're a
small state you don't like this plan.

and
they had their own plan (sometimes
referred to as the New Jersey Plan), and
this was favored by small states. they
say let's have a unicameral legislature
(one house), and each state would have
equal representation.

there's a lot of
tension over this issue, but luckily
there's a compromise. it's called great
compromise (introduced by Roger Sherman,
sometimes referred to as the Connecticut
plan), and here's what they do: they're
going to take elements of both plans.
you're going to have a bicameral
legislature (so you're going to have a
two house). the upper house (the Senate):
two representatives per state (so it didn't
matter how big or small your state was,
you're going to get two senators). and in
the lower house (the House of
Representatives), the representation would
be based upon population (so the more
people living in the state, the more
people you get to elect).

while they solve
the population issue, another issue kind
of hovered over the Constitutional
Convention, and that has to do with
slavery. there was a debate over whether
slaves should be counted in the state
population. southerners said yes you
should count our slaves so we can get
more representatives. northerners say no
you don't give them any political or
social or economic rights so the answer
is no.

they come up with a very
controversial compromise called the
three-fifths compromise, and basically
what it said: slaves would be counted as
three-fifths
of a person when deciding representation
in the House of Reps. so each slave would
count as three-fifths, and by doing so
this adds more representatives in the
House of Reps for southern states
which tended to have large slave
populations.

another agreement
surrounding the issue of slavery has to
do with the slave trade: how much longer
should we allow people to be forcibly
brought to this new nation founded upon
liberty and freedom and all that good
stuff? and at the convention they decide
they're going to allow the slave trade
to continue until 1808. and for another
20 years, slaves are allowed to be
brought into the United States.

and then
finally, although the word slave or
slavery was not used in the Constitution,
it's important to note the institution
of slavery was very much protected by
the original document. they even have a
Fugitive Slave Clause which is added
which says if your slave runs away, you
are able to reacquire your property and
bring them back to your plantation or
farm.

there's other debates and conflicts
at the Constitutional Convention, but
eventually they create a document, and
they have to figure out whether or not
we're going to ratify or approve it. the
Constitution would only take effect if 9
out of 13 states ratified it, and there
are going to be supporters and haters on
both sides.

the Federalists were those
individuals who were the supporters of
the Constitution, and they really favored
a strong central government.

on the other
end were the anti-federalists (people
like Thomas Jefferson even though he was
over in Europe). these were the critics of
the Constitution, and they favored a weak
central government. yes there were flaws
with the Articles of Confederation, but
this new government in their mind was
giving too much power to the central
government. and anti-federalists were
very much opposed to ratification. they
tended to favor state rights.

you do have
people trying to convince those who did
not want ratification, and you could see
this in the Federalist Papers. these are
85 essays largely written by James
Madison and Hamilton, but you also got
some by John Jay, and they were designed
to persuade people to support
ratification of the Constitution.

eventually the thing that helps get
enough anti federalists to support
ratification is the guarantee of a Bill
of Rights that would be added to the
Constitution. the first ten amendments
would be added later on, and the idea
behind the Bill of Rights is it
enumerated (it's spelled out specifically)
individual rights and explicitly
restricted powers of the federal
government.

and the new government will
take effect in 1789 when George
Washington takes office as the nation's
first president.

finally, some stuff you
should know about the Constitution: the
Constitution set up a government based
upon popular sovereignty, and this means
power is in the hands of the people (they
are the source of a government's power).
separation of powers between the three
branches of government is very much a
part of this constitutional system, and
it's important to note that the power of
government is limited, and there are
checks and balances and a separation of
powers embedded in this document.

another
concept you should know about is the
fact that the Constitution set up a
division of power between the national
and state governments. both the national
and state governments have power, and
this is the system known as federalism.
but it's also important to note that the
federal government (the national
government) ultimately has supremacy over
the states. ratification meant the
Constitution would be the supreme law of
the land.

and lastly, under the
Constitution, presidents would not be
elected directly by the voters. in fact,
the framers of the Constitution wanted
to limit excessive popular influence.
they feared too much democracy would
lead to mob rule. number these were men
of property and money, so they created
the Electoral College as the means of
electing the President of the United
States.
