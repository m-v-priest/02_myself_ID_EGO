== 释义

What's going down 怎么回事, APUSH? Today we're going to take a look at 审视 period three from 1754 to 1800. We're going to knock this out 完成；搞定 real quick -- it's going to be a real surface 表面的；肤浅的 kind of overview 概述. Make sure you study, but this will kind of get you on the right track 走上正轨.

First thing to keep in mind 记住 -- some big ideas for you: one, England is going to attempt to reassert 重申；重新确立 control over the colonies following the French and Indian War 法印战争 which begins in 1754 (which is why period 3 starts with 1754). We're going to take a look at that in a moment. The colonies are going to react to 对……作出反应 this attempt to control them. They're eventually, after a lot of debate 辩论；讨论, going to declare their independence 宣布独立, and then after a lot of fighting they're going to become a new nation -- America.

Third point is there are going to be disagreements 分歧；不一致 over the social, political, and economic identity 身份；特征 of the young United States. So we're going to take a look at each one of these really quickly, starting with the first important point: England is going to attempt to put the colonies in check 控制；管束 following a long period of salutary neglect 有益的忽视.

Rewind for a second 倒回一下 -- 1754. Prior to 在……之前 that, you have the French and the British, New Spain in the kind of purplish color, and the 13 colonies had all been established. And prior to 1763, they're going to be accustomed to 习惯于 salutary neglect, meaning the British are going to largely leave them alone -- and not because they're not interested in the colonies, but they're involved in internal problems and foreign problems. And 1763 marks a turning point 转折点 in their relationship where basically the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War 七年战争) comes to an end 结束, and England is going to kind of end that period of salutary neglect -- that period of reduced intervention 干预 in colonial affairs 殖民地事务.

Now the reason why they're going to end it in 1763 after the Seven Years' War is because England emerges from the war with massive debt 巨额债务. They're broke 破产的, having defended the colonies who went into the Ohio Valley 俄亥俄山谷 and sparked 引发 this big old war in North America with their French rivals 对手. Now what's going to happen is 1763 -- salutary neglect comes to an end, and they're going to initiate 发起；开始实施 all sorts of policies. One, they're going to enforce 执行 some of those old mercantile laws 重商主义法律 such as the Navigation Acts 航海条例. They're going to put the Proclamation of 1763 1763年公告 in place 实施；落实 to keep the colonies from going into the frontier 边境；边疆 out west where they'll come into contact with 与……接触 Native Americans (remember Pontiac's Rebellion 庞蒂亚克起义). They're going to have a bunch of taxes 税收 such as the Sugar and the Stamp Acts 糖税法和印花税法. They're going to require that the colonists allow British soldiers to enter into their homes because the British are feeling "Hey, we're defending you," and so you get the Quartering Act 驻军法. You get the Townshend Acts 汤森法案, the Tea Act 茶叶法, the Intolerable Acts 不可容忍法令, and the Quebec Act 魁北克法案. You can take a look at all of those, but they all kind of show England trying to enforce economic, political restrictions 限制 and control on the colonies.

Now of course the colonies are going to respond in a variety of ways 以多种方式回应, and you have things like the Stamp Act Congress 印花税法大会 where the colonies are meeting and organizing 组织 and really trying to figure out 弄清楚 how to proceed 继续进行. You have the Committee of Correspondence 通讯委员会 where they're starting to communicate with one another 相互交流. Groups such as the Sons of Liberty 自由之子, and eventually the Continental Congress 大陆会议 which forms prior to 在……之前 the battles of Lexington and Concord 列克星敦和康科德战役 and comes back and forms again with the Second Continental Congress 第二届大陆会议. So make sure you understand the kind of cause and effect 因果关系 between the British policies and the colonies' reactions during this period.

Now some stuff that you need to keep in mind is this is a slow movement to the American Revolution 美国独立战争. These colonies are not rapidly 迅速地, you know, wrapping themselves up in American flags and saying "We're America, let's do this." And there's a couple of factors 因素 in this kind of point that you need to keep in mind. They're being inspired by 受到……的启发 Enlightenment ideas 启蒙思想 that are coming over from Europe -- people like Locke and Rousseau. The colonial elites 殖民地精英 are going to, especially during the Stamp Act crisis 印花税法危机, organize people -- people like John Hancock and others with wealth. And then you get the role of the kind of the grassroots movements 草根运动 -- the ordinary colonists calling for independence 呼吁独立. And it's a slow process 过程 because this is a big deal 重要的事情 -- they're used to England.

Now when they eventually do declare independence, you know you get the influence of Thomas Paine's Common Sense 《常识》 and Jefferson's Declaration of Independence 《独立宣言》. They're going to have some reasons why they eventually win: one, the colonies have homefield advantage 主场优势 -- they know the land. England has to supply their stuff from long distances 长距离供应物资. Eventually the French, following the Battle of Saratoga 萨拉托加大捷, are going to help us out 帮助我们. And we got some pretty awesome leaders like George Washington and others.

Finally, during the American Revolution, we are going to be creating new government structures 政府架构, and they're going to be based upon 基于 Enlightenment principles 启蒙原则 -- things like natural rights 自然权利, the consent of the governed 被统治者的同意, restrictions on government power 对政府权力的限制. And they're going to be also really influenced by the fear of replacing the strong British power -- centralized power 中央集权 in the monarch 君主 in the parliament 议会 -- and so they're going to put severe restrictions on government 对政府实施严格限制. So make sure you know that.

Now some social and political impacts 影响 of the American Revolution: one, it's not a very radical revolution 激进的革命 because the colonial elite are going to be the people who are still in charge 掌权 when the whole thing's said and done 总而言之. This is not going to lead to some radical transformation of wealth 财富的彻底转变. It is not a radical revolution, but some states are going to eliminate 消除 property requirements for voting 投票的财产资格要求, so new people are going to be engaged in the political process 参与政治进程. These people are going to be though white men.

It's going to have some international consequences 后果. The French Revolution 法国大革命 will happen in 1789. Revolutions throughout Latin America 拉丁美洲 will take place throughout the 19th century, and in the early 1800s Haiti 海地 will experience their revolution. All of these revolutions are going to be influenced by what happened during the American Revolution.

Women are going to have some impacts during this period. You have this idea of Republican Motherhood 共和母亲理念 -- this idea that women are meant to raise good citizens 培养优秀公民, that they will be civic-minded 有公民意识的, and they will be involved in the new republic's affairs 参与新共和国事务 (and we're talking the young boys here). Abigail Adams, for instance 例如 during the American Revolution, reminded her husband John to "remember the ladies." And unfortunately for women, they are going to suffer a lack of political rights 缺乏政治权利 in the political process throughout much of this period post-American Revolution 美国独立战争后的大部分时期.

For African-Americans, there is going to be gradual emancipation 逐步解放, especially in the north. Northern and middle states are going to slowly end slavery -- not because they're nicer up there, but just because it wasn't economically viable 经济上可行的. For instance, you have the Pennsylvania gradual emancipation law 宾夕法尼亚逐步解放奴隶法. However, as slavery is being kind of slowly abolished 废除 in some parts of the country, in other parts -- the south and into the west -- slavery is going to be protected under the new constitution 宪法, and many people consider the constitution a pro-slavery document 支持奴隶制的文件.

And then finally, for Native Americans 美洲原住民, life is going to get rough 艰难的 because under the Treaty of Paris 巴黎条约 in 1783, there are no protections for them. No one consults them 征求他们的意见. We'll look at what happens with native people in a moment.

Some other things to keep in mind 记住 as the nation is fighting the American Revolution and eventually winning it: they're going to create new government structures. And I've kind of mentioned this, but the Enlightenment plays a huge role 起重要作用. People like Locke and this idea of the consent of the governed, natural inalienable rights 不可剥夺的自然权利. Rousseau -- Jefferson's going to be influenced by these ideas. And of course the profound impact 深远影响 of Thomas Paine's Common Sense in January of 1776 -- it's going to have a huge impact on the minds of the colonial people 殖民地人民.

Key thing that happens is you're going to have the creation of a weak national government 软弱的国家政府. This is under the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例. Make sure you know the challenges and successes of the Articles -- there are more challenges than there are successes. And finally, the Articles of Confederation will eventually be replaced by the Constitution 宪法, and it's important that you know the compromises 妥协；折衷 that were needed to create and eventually ratify 批准 the Constitution.

Speaking of those 说到那些, there were some constitutional issues 宪法问题. Most of them dealt with 涉及 representation 代表权. At first you had the Virginia Plan 弗吉尼亚方案 which was the large state plan -- the more people you have, the more reps 代表 you would get. And obviously Virginia, the most populated state, loved that plan. There was also the New Jersey Plan 新泽西方案, or also known as the small states plan -- basically everyone would have equal representation 平等代表权, which is what the Articles of Confederation had. And eventually after a lot of debate, the Great Compromise 大妥协 was agreed upon (also called the Connecticut Compromise 康涅狄格妥协) where we have a bicameral legislature 两院制立法机构 -- the House of Reps 众议院 based upon population 按人口比例, the Senate 参议院 everyone gets equal reps (which is two).

The Three-Fifths Compromise 五分之三妥协 is important -- make sure you know about that. And it deals with southerners wanting their slaves to be counted for representation purposes 为了代表权计算奴隶人数. So for every five slaves, three would be counted in terms of representation 就代表权而言计算为三个, and this gives southerners a huge amount of power as a result 结果赋予南方人巨大权力. So the Three-Fifths Compromise is important. And know that the constitution was created with severe limits on federal power 对联邦权力进行严格限制. You had separation of powers 权力分立 -- you know, the legislative 立法的, the executive 行政的, and the judicial 司法的 -- they have different powers. There's checks and balances 制衡. It's a federalist system 联邦制 -- you have a federal government 联邦政府 and a state government 州政府 sharing power 分享权力. So you have federalism 联邦主义, and it's all based upon this idea of republicanism 共和主义 -- representative government 代议制政府. So those are some of the constitutional issues you should be aware of 了解.

And keep in mind the Articles of Confederation had this as their framework for government 政府框架 -- it was a very weak federal government. And then in 1789, the constitution comes along 出现, and it does expand dramatically 大幅扩张, even though there are restrictions on the power of the federal government. Even under the constitution, it expands that power of the federal government a great deal 大大增强联邦政府的权力 -- adds a president, two-house legislature 两院制立法机构, the power of tax and regulate trade 征税和管理贸易的权力, it gives a court 设立法院. You only need three-fourths 四分之三 to make an amendment 修正案. And so these are some of the changes.

Key thing: how or why was the Constitution ratified? Not everyone agreed with it when they were all done at the constitutional convention 制宪会议. You had the Federalists 联邦党人 who were saying "Yep, let's do this." You had the Federalist Papers 《联邦党人文集》 -- a series of essays 一系列文章 that talked about the Constitution and why it was needed, why it should be ratified. But on the other side, you had the Anti-Federalists 反联邦党人, and these were people who felt that this new government was too powerful and should not be ratified. And of course there was a big debate, but eventually the Anti-Federalists agree: "We will ratify if you promise to include a bill of rights 权利法案." And that does get added to the constitution.

Some other things to keep in mind: Shays' Rebellion 谢斯起义 is always an important thing. Shays' Rebellion happens during the Articles of Confederation. The government under the Articles is too weak to really put it down 镇压；平息 -- it has to be put down by a private militia 私人民兵. To contrast that with 与……对比 Whiskey Rebellion 威士忌酒暴乱, in which under the Articles of Confederation, the rebellion over taxes in western Pennsylvania 宾夕法尼亚州西部的税收叛乱 is crushed 镇压 by a very powerful federal government under the Constitution. So it's always good to know the kind of differences and similarities between these two rebellions in the backcountry of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

Important point: disagreements are going to develop over the new nation's political, economic, and social identity. People are not going to agree what this young nation should look like. And really the domestic disagreements 国内分歧 revolve around 围绕；以……为中心 the Secretary of the Treasury's 财政部长 financial program -- Alexander Hamilton. And you have the assumption plan 债务承担计划 where the federal government is going to be taking the state debt 承担州债务, the excise taxes 消费税, the high tariffs 高关税, and the big one -- the bank 银行. The bank is going to create all sorts of issues 引发各种问题, and constitutionally there is disagreements about whether or not the government can do it or not 在宪法层面存在争议政府是否有权这样做.

Hamilton is doing these programs because he favors a strong central government 支持强大的中央政府. He is a Federalist. He favors developing the nation's economy and particularly manufacturing 制造业. And they believe in a loose interpretation of the Constitution 对宪法的宽泛解释. On the other side is Jefferson and his homeboys -- the Democratic-Republicans 民主共和党人 -- who are going to reject Hamilton's plan 拒绝汉密尔顿的计划. They're going to accept some things after compromise 经过妥协后接受一些内容, but they favor a weak central government 支持弱小的中央政府. They are going to favor agriculture 农业, and they believe in a strict interpretation of the constitution 对宪法的严格解释 -- meaning only if it's in there can the government do it 意味着只有宪法明确规定政府才能这样做. So these disagreements reveal the growth of political parties 政党的发展.

In fact, federal versus state government 联邦政府与州政府的对比 can best be seen in the Alien and Sedition Acts 客籍法和煽动叛乱法, which is passed during the administration of John Adams 约翰·亚当斯政府任期内 by a Federalist-controlled Congress 由联邦党人控制的国会. And these basically, especially the Sedition Acts 煽动叛乱法, create all sorts of controversy 引发各种争议. You have the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions 弗吉尼亚和肯塔基决议 written by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and basically in that they say the states of Kentucky and Virginia have the right of nullification 否决权 -- they, the states, can ignore a federal law (in this case the Sedition Acts) if they feel it's unconstitutional 违宪的. And this battle between federal and state will continue throughout American history.

Some foreign disagreements 对外分歧 to keep in mind for period 3: you're going to have the French Revolution in 1789. France goes to war with 与……开战 Europe. There's all sorts of concerns in America about whether or not we should support this French Revolution. And Washington decides the young nation should stay the heck out of 远离 Europeans' war, and he issues the Proclamation of Neutrality 中立宣言. You have Citizen Genêt 热内公民 who comes over to the United States and tries to challenge that neutrality 挑战中立立场. He is eventually kind of scolded 斥责. You have the XYZ Affair XYZ事件 under John Adams where we try to negotiate 谈判, and this leads to an international incident 国际事件. And then the Quasi-War 准战争 happens where you have a war between the United States and France, and impressment 强征入伍 taking place. And eventually the Convention of 1800 1800年公约 ending the Franco-American alliance 法美联盟 that had been around since 1778.

You also have drama 争端 with England. The Treaty of Paris which ended the American Revolution did not end our problem with them. They had forts 堡垒 on American soil 美国领土上. They were giving guns to Native Americans. There was impressment of American sailors and ships 强征美国水手和船只入伍. And all of this kind of eventually tries to get resolved by Jay's Treaty 杰伊条约, but it doesn't really work, and you have a lot of anger especially amongst Democratic-Republicans over Jay's Treaty.

You have drama with Spain. They had closed off 关闭 the Mississippi River 密西西比河 under the Articles of Confederation. They had actually questioned the boundaries between the US and Florida 质疑美国与佛罗里达的边界. And eventually some of that gets solved with Pinckney's Treaty 平克尼条约. And make sure you know about Washington's Farewell Address 华盛顿告别演说 where he says stay the heck out of permanent alliances 永久联盟 and "political parties suck."

These kind of issues not only are they challenges for the young nation, but they cause further divisions 分裂 between the Democratic-Republicans who tended to favor France and the Federalists who tended to favor England.

Of course, this period 3 ends with 1800, which is a significant year 重要年份 in American history because it is the election of 1800. The Democratic-Republican party 民主共和党 wins -- Thomas Jefferson 托马斯·杰斐逊 becomes president. And it is significant and sometimes referred to as 被称为 the Revolution of 1800 because it is the first peaceful transfer of power 和平权力交接 between political parties 政党.

Now something we left off 遗漏 but really important throughout all this stuff -- something that was not peaceful unfortunately -- is Native Americans are going to play a key role 发挥关键作用, and they are going to respond to European and American settlements 定居点 in a variety of ways. For instance, during the French and Indian War, largely the native people are going to join the French and largely be on the side of 站在……一边 the French. The English and the colonies are going to try under the Albany Plan 奥尔巴尼计划 to get the Iroquois 易洛魁人 to support them. Ultimately 最终 they will, but the French are going to be defeated, causing all sorts of problems.

In fact, following the French defeat, they've lost an important ally 盟友 in North America. You have Pontiac's Rebellion 庞蒂亚克起义 where Pontiac and other natives start rebelling 反抗, trying to keep out settlers from their land 阻止定居者进入他们的土地, which leads to the British passing the Proclamation of 1763.

During the American Revolution, many native people sided with 支持 the British once again hoping to keep the colonists out of their land. Ultimately that decision backfires 适得其反 because at the Treaty of Paris, the United States' boundaries 边界 are from the Atlantic to the Mississippi River. No one asks the native people living in those areas are they cool with that 他们是否同意.

During this period of time, you also have in 1783 - 1785 a man by the name of Chief Little Turtle 小乌龟酋长 forming the Western Confederacy 西部联盟, and he is going to lead resistance 抵抗 in the old Northwest 旧西北地区 against American expansion 美国扩张. And of course unfortunately, the Battle of Fallen Timbers 鹿寨战役 -- the native resistance in the old west is going to be crushed 镇压, and the Treaty of Greenville 格林维尔条约 is going to mark the end of native resistance in that region 标志着该地区原住民抵抗的结束.

And meanwhile over on the big old west coast, Spanish missionaries 传教士 are creeping up 逐渐推进 the coast of California forming these missions 传教站, converting the native people to Catholicism 使原住民皈依天主教. So native history 原住民历史 is an important component 组成部分 of period 3 APUSH.

Finally, we're almost done. Keep in mind during this time we have the expansion of the United States. Eventually remember the Northwest Ordinances 西北法令 -- those things that were really successful under the Articles of Confederation. The United States is expanding its territory 领土, and they ban slavery 禁止奴隶制 and they allow public education 公共教育 in those regions. However, slavery even though it ends in the north in the middle states following the American Revolution slowly, it is going to continue to expand 继续扩张. It's going to be protected under the Constitution 宪法保护. The slave trade 奴隶贸易 is going to continue for another 20 years, and slavery is going to continue to be a fact of life 生活现实 throughout the South and as they move west.

And of course as the nation grows, just as the colonies were different because of unique geographic, environmental factors 因素, the regional identities 地区特征 are going to continue and they're going to be strengthened between the northern states, the southern states, and the western states. And we're going to see this play out 展现；发生 in APUSH period 4 and five.

Woo! We finished finally -- APUSH period 3. That's a quick rundown 简要概述. Make sure you read your book, check out my other videos, subscribe to the channel 订阅频道 if you haven't done so, click like on the video 点赞视频, tell all the APUSH homies 伙伴 out in the world to check out Jo Productions, and most importantly always stand up for what you believe in 坚持自己的信念 -- you never know, you may end up in a school textbook one day like my crazy self. Peace!

== 中文翻译

大家好，APUSH的同学们！今天我们来看一下1754年至1800年的第三时期。我们将快速过一遍——这将是一个非常表面的概述。务必认真学习，但这将帮助你们走上正确的轨道。

首先要记住——几个重要的概念：第一，在始于1754年的法国和印第安人战争之后，英国将试图重新确立对殖民地的控制（这就是为什么第三时期从1754年开始）。我们稍后会讨论这一点。殖民地将对这种控制它们的企图做出反应。经过大量的辩论，它们最终将宣布独立，然后在经过大量的战斗之后，它们将成为一个新国家——美国。

第三点是，对于年轻美国的社会、政治和经济特性，将会存在分歧。因此，我们将快速地看一下每一个方面，首先从第一个重要的点开始：在经历了长期的有益的忽视之后，英国将试图约束殖民地。

让我们倒回一下——1754年。在此之前，你们有法国和英国，紫色区域的新西班牙，以及已经建立的13个殖民地。在1763年之前，它们将习惯于有益的忽视，这意味着英国将在很大程度上放任它们——这并不是因为它们对殖民地不感兴趣，而是它们卷入了国内和国外的问题。1763年标志着它们关系的一个转折点，基本上法国和印第安人战争（七年战争）结束了，英国将结束那个有益的忽视时期——那个减少干预殖民地事务的时期。

现在，它们在七年战争后的1763年结束这种忽视的原因是，英国从战争中脱颖而出，背负着巨额债务。它们破产了，因为它们保卫了进入俄亥俄河谷并与它们的法国竞争对手在北美引发这场大规模战争的殖民地。现在发生的是1763年——有益的忽视结束了，它们将开始实施各种政策。第一，它们将执行一些旧的重商主义法律，例如《航海法案》。它们将实施1763年公告，以阻止殖民地进入西部边疆，在那里它们会与美洲原住民接触（记住庞蒂亚克叛乱）。它们将征收一系列税收，例如《糖税法》和《印花税法》。它们将要求殖民者允许英国士兵进入他们的家，因为英国人觉得“嘿，我们在保护你们”，所以你们有了《住宿法》。你们有了《汤森法案》、《茶叶法案》、《不可容忍法案》和《魁北克法案》。你们可以看看所有这些法案，但它们都表明英国试图对殖民地实施经济和政治限制和控制。

当然，殖民地将以各种方式做出反应，你们看到了诸如《印花税法会议》之类的事件，殖民地在那里会面、组织，并真正试图弄清楚如何进行。你们有了通讯委员会，它们开始相互沟通。诸如自由之子之类的团体，以及最终在列克星敦和康科德战役之前成立并再次与第二届大陆会议重新组建的大陆会议。因此，务必理解这一时期英国政策与殖民地反应之间的因果关系。

现在，你们需要记住一些事情是，这是一个缓慢走向美国革命的运动。这些殖民地并没有迅速地，你们知道，用美国国旗包裹自己并说“我们是美国，让我们行动起来”。在这个问题的几个方面，你们需要记住一些因素。它们受到来自欧洲的启蒙思想的启发——例如洛克和卢梭。殖民地精英，尤其是在《印花税法》危机期间，将组织民众——像约翰·汉考克和其他富人。然后你们看到了草根运动的作用——普通殖民者呼吁独立。这是一个缓慢的过程，因为这是一件大事——他们习惯了英国。

现在，当他们最终宣布独立时，你们知道，你们受到了托马斯·潘恩的《常识》和杰斐逊的《独立宣言》的影响。他们将有一些最终获胜的原因：第一，殖民地拥有主场优势——他们了解这片土地。英国必须从遥远的地方供应物资。最终，在萨拉托加战役之后，法国将帮助我们。我们还有一些非常了不起的领导人，例如乔治·华盛顿和其他人。

最后，在美国革命期间，我们将创建新的政府结构，它们将基于启蒙原则——例如自然权利、被统治者的同意、对政府权力的限制。它们也将受到对取代强大的英国权力——君主和议会中集权——的恐惧的深刻影响，因此它们将对政府施加严格的限制。因此，务必了解这一点。

现在，美国革命的一些社会和政治影响：第一，这不是一场非常激进的革命，因为当一切尘埃落定时，殖民地精英仍然是掌权者。这不会导致财富的彻底转变。这不是一场激进的革命，但一些州将取消投票的财产要求，因此新人将参与政治进程。这些人将是白人男性。

这将产生一些国际影响。法国大革命将于1789年发生。整个19世纪拉丁美洲将发生革命，19世纪初海地将经历他们的革命。所有这些革命都将受到美国革命的影响。

妇女在这个时期将产生一些影响。你们有共和母性的概念——这种认为妇女应该培养好公民、她们将具有公民意识并参与新共和国事务（我们这里指的是年轻的男孩）的想法。例如，在美国革命期间，阿比盖尔·亚当斯提醒她的丈夫约翰“记住女士们”。不幸的是，对于妇女来说，在美国革命后的大部分时期，她们将在政治进程中遭受政治权利的缺乏。

对于非裔美国人来说，将会出现逐步解放，尤其是在北方。北方和中部各州将缓慢地结束奴隶制——这并不是因为他们更善良，而仅仅是因为奴隶制在经济上不可行。例如，你们有宾夕法尼亚州的逐步解放法。然而，随着奴隶制在该国某些地区缓慢废除，在其他地区——南方和西部——奴隶制将在新宪法下受到保护，许多人认为宪法是一份亲奴隶制的文件。

最后，对于美洲原住民来说，生活将变得艰难，因为在1783年的《巴黎条约》中，没有任何对他们的保护。没有人咨询他们。我们稍后会看看当地人民会发生什么。

随着这个国家进行美国革命并最终赢得胜利，还有一些事情需要记住：他们将创建新的政府结构。我刚才已经提到过，但启蒙运动发挥了巨大的作用。像洛克这样的人以及被统治者的同意、自然不可剥夺的权利这样的思想。卢梭——杰斐逊将受到这些思想的影响。当然，托马斯·潘恩于1776年1月发表的《常识》产生了深刻的影响——它将对殖民地人民的思想产生巨大的影响。

关键的事情是你们将建立一个软弱的中央政府。这是在《邦联条例》下。务必了解《邦联条例》的挑战和成功——挑战多于成功。最后，《邦联条例》最终将被宪法取代，重要的是你们要了解创建和最终批准宪法所需的妥协。

说到这些，有一些宪法问题。大多数问题都与代表权有关。起初你们有弗吉尼亚方案，这是大州方案——你们的人口越多，你们的代表就越多。显然，人口最多的州弗吉尼亚喜欢这个方案。还有新泽西方案，也称为小州方案——基本上每个人都将拥有平等的代表权，这正是《邦联条例》所规定的。经过大量的辩论，最终达成了《大妥协》（也称为《康涅狄格妥协》），我们拥有一个两院制立法机构——众议院基于人口，参议院每个人都拥有平等的代表权（即两人）。

五分之三妥协很重要——务必了解这一点。它涉及南方人希望他们的奴隶被计入代表权的目的。因此，每五个奴隶中，将有三个被计入代表权，这使得南方人因此获得了巨大的权力。因此，五分之三妥协很重要。要知道，宪法的制定对联邦权力有严格的限制。你们有权力分立——你们知道，立法、行政和司法——它们拥有不同的权力。有制衡。这是一个联邦制体系——你们有一个联邦政府和一个州政府分享权力。因此，你们有联邦制，这一切都基于共和主义——代议制政府的思想。这些是你们应该了解的一些宪法问题。

记住，《邦联条例》以此作为其政府框架——这是一个非常软弱的联邦政府。然后在1789年，宪法出台了，它极大地扩展了权力，即使联邦政府的权力受到限制。即使在宪法下，它也极大地扩展了联邦政府的权力——增加了总统、两院制立法机构、征税和管理贸易的权力，它设立了法院。只需要四分之三的多数票即可进行修正。这些是一些变化。

关键问题：宪法是如何或为何获得批准的？宪法会议结束后，并非所有人都同意。你们有联邦党人说“是的，让我们这样做吧”。你们有《联邦党人文集》——一系列讨论宪法及其必要性、为何应该批准的论文。但在另一方面，你们有反联邦党人，这些人认为这个新政府权力过大，不应该批准。当然，有过一场激烈的辩论，但最终反联邦党人同意：“如果你承诺加入权利法案，我们将批准。”权利法案确实被加入了宪法。

还有一些需要记住的事情：《谢司叛乱》始终是一件重要的事情。《谢司叛乱》发生在《邦联条例》时期。条例下的政府太软弱，无法真正镇压它——它必须由私人民兵镇压。与此形成对比的是《威士忌叛乱》，在宪法下的《邦联条例》时期，宾夕法尼亚西部因税收而发生的叛乱被宪法下非常强大的联邦政府镇压了。因此，了解马萨诸塞州和宾夕法尼亚州内陆地区这两次叛乱之间的异同总是好的。

重要的一点：关于新国家的政治、经济和社会特性，将会出现分歧。人们不会同意这个年轻的国家应该是什么样子。国内的分歧实际上围绕着财政部长亚历山大·汉密尔顿的财政计划展开。你们有联邦政府将承担州债务的承担计划、消费税、高关税以及最重要的——银行。银行将产生各种各样的问题，并且在宪法上存在关于政府是否可以这样做或不能做的问题。

汉密尔顿正在实施这些计划，因为他赞成一个强大的中央政府。他是一个联邦党人。他赞成发展国家经济，特别是制造业。他们相信对宪法的宽松解释。另一方面是杰斐逊和他的同党——民主共和党人——他们将拒绝汉密尔顿的计划。经过妥协，他们将接受一些事情，但他们赞成一个软弱的中央政府。他们将赞成农业，并且他们相信对宪法的严格解释——这意味着只有宪法中明确规定的，政府才能这样做。这些分歧揭示了政党的成长。

事实上，联邦政府与州政府之间的冲突在《外国人与煽动叛乱法案》中体现得最为明显，该法案是在约翰·亚当斯执政期间由联邦党控制的国会通过的。这些法案，尤其是《煽动叛乱法案》，引发了各种争议。你们有托马斯·杰斐逊和詹姆斯·麦迪逊撰写的《弗吉尼亚和肯塔基决议》，基本上他们在其中声明肯塔基州和弗吉尼亚州拥有废止权——如果他们认为联邦法律（在本案中是《煽动叛乱法案》）违宪，他们（各州）可以无视该法律。联邦与州之间的这场斗争将在整个美国历史上持续下去。

第三时期需要记住的一些外交分歧：你们将在1789年发生法国大革命。法国与欧洲开战。美国国内对于我们是否应该支持这场法国大革命存在各种各样的担忧。华盛顿决定这个年轻的国家应该置身于欧洲人的战争之外，他发布了《中立宣言》。热内特公民来到美国，试图挑战这种中立。他最终受到了一些斥责。在约翰·亚当斯执政期间，你们发生了XYZ事件，我们试图进行谈判，这导致了一场国际事件。然后发生了准战争，美国和法国之间发生了战争，并且发生了强征水手的行为。最终，1800年的公约结束了自1778年以来一直存在的法美同盟。

你们也与英国有冲突。《巴黎条约》结束了美国革命，但并没有结束我们与英国的问题。他们在美国领土上有堡垒。他们向美洲原住民提供枪支。他们强征美国水手和船只。所有这些最终都试图通过《杰伊条约》解决，但并没有真正奏效，尤其是在民主共和党人中，对《杰伊条约》有很多愤怒。

你们与西班牙有冲突。他们在《邦联条例》下关闭了密西西比河。他们实际上质疑了美国和佛罗里达之间的边界。最终，其中一些问题通过《平克尼条约》得到解决。务必了解华盛顿的告别演说，他在其中说要远离永久性联盟，并且“政党很糟糕”。

这些问题不仅对这个年轻的国家来说是挑战，而且还导致了民主共和党人（倾向于法国）和联邦党人（倾向于英国）之间进一步的分裂。

当然，第三时期以1800年结束，这是美国历史上重要的一年，因为那是1800年的选举。民主共和党获胜——托马斯·杰斐逊成为总统。这具有重要意义，有时被称为1800年革命，因为这是政党之间第一次和平的权力交接。

现在，我们遗漏了一些但贯穿所有这些事情的重要内容——不幸的是，这并不和平——美洲原住民将发挥关键作用，他们将以各种方式回应欧洲和美国的定居点。例如，在法国和印第安人战争期间，当地人民大多将加入法国，并大多站在法国一边。英国和殖民地将在奥尔巴尼计划下试图让易洛魁人支持他们。最终他们会支持，但法国将被击败，导致各种各样的问题。

事实上，在法国战败后，他们在北美失去了一个重要的盟友。你们发生了庞蒂亚克叛乱，庞蒂亚克和其他当地人开始反叛，试图阻止定居者进入他们的土地，这导致英国通过了1763年公告。

在美国革命期间，许多当地人民再次站在英国一边，希望阻止殖民者进入他们的土地。最终这个决定适得其反，因为在《巴黎条约》中，美国的边界是从大西洋到密西西比河。没有人问居住在这些地区的当地人民是否同意。

在此期间，你们在1783-1785年还有一位名叫小海龟酋长的人组建了西部联盟，他将在旧西北地区领导抵抗美国扩张的行动。当然不幸的是，在堕落木材之战中，旧西部地区的当地抵抗将被镇压，《格林维尔条约》将标志着该地区当地抵抗的结束。

与此同时，在广阔的西海岸，西班牙传教士沿着加利福尼亚海岸缓慢前进，建立这些传教站，将当地人民皈依天主教。因此，当地历史是APUSH第三时期的重要组成部分。

最后，我们快完成了。记住在此期间，我们有美国的扩张。最终记住西北法令——那些在《邦联条例》下非常成功的事情。美国正在扩张其领土，他们在这些地区禁止奴隶制并允许公共教育。然而，尽管奴隶制在美国革命后在北部和中部各州缓慢结束，但它将继续扩张。它将在宪法下受到保护。奴隶贸易将再持续20年，奴隶制将继续是整个南方以及他们向西迁移过程中的生活事实。

当然，随着国家的壮大，正如殖民地由于独特的地理和环境因素而各不相同一样，北部各州、南部各州和西部各州之间的区域特性将继续存在并得到加强。我们将在APUSH第四和第五时期看到这一点。

哇！我们终于完成了——APUSH第三时期。这是一个快速的概述。务必阅读你们的书，查看我的其他视频，如果你们还没有订阅频道，请订阅，点击视频的“喜欢”，告诉世界上所有的APUSH同学们查看Jo Productions，最重要的是始终坚持你们所相信的——你们永远不知道，有一天你们可能会像我这个疯子一样出现在教科书中。再见了！

What's going down, APUSH? Today we're going to take a look at period three from 1754 to 1800. We're going to knock this out real quick -- it's going to be a real surface kind of overview. Make sure you study, but this will kind of get you on the right track.

First thing to keep in mind -- some big ideas for you: one, England is going to attempt to reassert control over the colonies following the French and Indian War which begins in 1754 (which is why period 3 starts with 1754). We're going to take a look at that in a moment. The colonies are going to react to this attempt to control them. They're eventually, after a lot of debate, going to declare their independence, and then after a lot of fighting they're going to become a new nation -- America.

Third point is there are going to be disagreements over the social, political, and economic identity of the young United States. So we're going to take a look at each one of these really quickly, starting with the first important point: England is going to attempt to put the colonies in check following a long period of salutary neglect.

Rewind for a second -- 1754. Prior to that, you have the French and the British, New Spain in the kind of purplish color, and the 13 colonies had all been established. And prior to 1763, they're going to be accustomed to salutary neglect, meaning the British are going to largely leave them alone -- and not because they're not interested in the colonies, but they're involved in internal problems and foreign problems. And 1763 marks a turning point in their relationship where basically the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War) comes to an end, and England is going to kind of end that period of salutary neglect -- that period of reduced intervention in colonial affairs.

Now the reason why they're going to end it in 1763 after the Seven Years' War is because England emerges from the war with massive debt. They're broke, having defended the colonies who went into the Ohio Valley and sparked this big old war in North America with their French rivals. Now what's going to happen is 1763 -- salutary neglect comes to an end, and they're going to initiate all sorts of policies. One, they're going to enforce some of those old mercantile laws such as the Navigation Acts. They're going to put the Proclamation of 1763 in place to keep the colonies from going into the frontier out west where they'll come into contact with Native Americans (remember Pontiac's Rebellion). They're going to have a bunch of taxes such as the Sugar and the Stamp Acts. They're going to require that the colonists allow British soldiers to enter into their homes because the British are feeling "Hey, we're defending you," and so you get the Quartering Act. You get the Townshend Acts, the Tea Act, the Intolerable Acts, and the Quebec Act. You can take a look at all of those, but they all kind of show England trying to enforce economic, political restrictions and control on the colonies.

Now of course the colonies are going to respond in a variety of ways, and you have things like the Stamp Act Congress where the colonies are meeting and organizing and really trying to figure out how to proceed. You have the Committee of Correspondence where they're starting to communicate with one another. Groups such as the Sons of Liberty, and eventually the Continental Congress which forms prior to the battles of Lexington and Concord and comes back and forms again with the Second Continental Congress. So make sure you understand the kind of cause and effect between the British policies and the colonies' reactions during this period.

Now some stuff that you need to keep in mind is this is a slow movement to the American Revolution. These colonies are not rapidly, you know, wrapping themselves up in American flags and saying "We're America, let's do this." And there's a couple of factors in this kind of point that you need to keep in mind. They're being inspired by Enlightenment ideas that are coming over from Europe -- people like Locke and Rousseau. The colonial elites are going to, especially during the Stamp Act crisis, organize people -- people like John Hancock and others with wealth. And then you get the role of the kind of the grassroots movements -- the ordinary colonists calling for independence. And it's a slow process because this is a big deal -- they're used to England.

Now when they eventually do declare independence, you know you get the influence of Thomas Paine's Common Sense and Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. They're going to have some reasons why they eventually win: one, the colonies have homefield advantage -- they know the land. England has to supply their stuff from long distances. Eventually the French, following the Battle of Saratoga, are going to help us out. And we got some pretty awesome leaders like George Washington and others.

Finally, during the American Revolution, we are going to be creating new government structures, and they're going to be based upon Enlightenment principles -- things like natural rights, the consent of the governed, restrictions on government power. And they're going to be also really influenced by the fear of replacing the strong British power -- centralized power in the monarch in the parliament -- and so they're going to put severe restrictions on government. So make sure you know that.

Now some social and political impacts of the American Revolution: one, it's not a very radical revolution because the colonial elite are going to be the people who are still in charge when the whole thing's said and done. This is not going to lead to some radical transformation of wealth. It is not a radical revolution, but some states are going to eliminate property requirements for voting, so new people are going to be engaged in the political process. These people are going to be though white men.

It's going to have some international consequences. The French Revolution will happen in 1789. Revolutions throughout Latin America will take place throughout the 19th century, and in the early 1800s Haiti will experience their revolution. All of these revolutions are going to be influenced by what happened during the American Revolution.

Women are going to have some impacts during this period. You have this idea of Republican Motherhood -- this idea that women are meant to raise good citizens, that they will be civic-minded, and they will be involved in the new republic's affairs (and we're talking the young boys here). Abigail Adams, for instance during the American Revolution, reminded her husband John to "remember the ladies." And unfortunately for women, they are going to suffer a lack of political rights in the political process throughout much of this period post-American Revolution.

For African-Americans, there is going to be gradual emancipation, especially in the north. Northern and middle states are going to slowly end slavery -- not because they're nicer up there, but just because it wasn't economically viable. For instance, you have the Pennsylvania gradual emancipation law. However, as slavery is being kind of slowly abolished in some parts of the country, in other parts -- the south and into the west -- slavery is going to be protected under the new constitution, and many people consider the constitution a pro-slavery document.

And then finally, for Native Americans, life is going to get rough because under the Treaty of Paris in 1783, there are no protections for them. No one consults them. We'll look at what happens with native people in a moment.

Some other things to keep in mind as the nation is fighting the American Revolution and eventually winning it: they're going to create new government structures. And I've kind of mentioned this, but the Enlightenment plays a huge role. People like Locke and this idea of the consent of the governed, natural inalienable rights. Rousseau -- Jefferson's going to be influenced by these ideas. And of course the profound impact of Thomas Paine's Common Sense in January of 1776 -- it's going to have a huge impact on the minds of the colonial people.

Key thing that happens is you're going to have the creation of a weak national government. This is under the Articles of Confederation. Make sure you know the challenges and successes of the Articles -- there are more challenges than there are successes. And finally, the Articles of Confederation will eventually be replaced by the Constitution, and it's important that you know the compromises that were needed to create and eventually ratify the Constitution.

Speaking of those, there were some constitutional issues. Most of them dealt with representation. At first you had the Virginia Plan which was the large state plan -- the more people you have, the more reps you would get. And obviously Virginia, the most populated state, loved that plan. There was also the New Jersey Plan, or also known as the small states plan -- basically everyone would have equal representation, which is what the Articles of Confederation had. And eventually after a lot of debate, the Great Compromise was agreed upon (also called the Connecticut Compromise) where we have a bicameral legislature -- the House of Reps based upon population, the Senate everyone gets equal reps (which is two).

The Three-Fifths Compromise is important -- make sure you know about that. And it deals with southerners wanting their slaves to be counted for representation purposes. So for every five slaves, three would be counted in terms of representation, and this gives southerners a huge amount of power as a result. So the Three-Fifths Compromise is important. And know that the constitution was created with severe limits on federal power. You had separation of powers -- you know, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial -- they have different powers. There's checks and balances. It's a federalist system -- you have a federal government and a state government sharing power. So you have federalism, and it's all based upon this idea of republicanism -- representative government. So those are some of the constitutional issues you should be aware of.

And keep in mind the Articles of Confederation had this as their framework for government -- it was a very weak federal government. And then in 1789, the constitution comes along, and it does expand dramatically, even though there are restrictions on the power of the federal government. Even under the constitution, it expands that power of the federal government a great deal -- adds a president, two-house legislature, the power of tax and regulate trade, it gives a court. You only need three-fourths to make an amendment. And so these are some of the changes.

Key thing: how or why was the Constitution ratified? Not everyone agreed with it when they were all done at the constitutional convention. You had the Federalists who were saying "Yep, let's do this." You had the Federalist Papers -- a series of essays that talked about the Constitution and why it was needed, why it should be ratified. But on the other side, you had the Anti-Federalists, and these were people who felt that this new government was too powerful and should not be ratified. And of course there was a big debate, but eventually the Anti-Federalists agree: "We will ratify if you promise to include a bill of rights." And that does get added to the constitution.

Some other things to keep in mind: Shays' Rebellion is always an important thing. Shays' Rebellion happens during the Articles of Confederation. The government under the Articles is too weak to really put it down -- it has to be put down by a private militia. To contrast that with Whiskey Rebellion, in which under the Articles of Confederation, the rebellion over taxes in western Pennsylvania is crushed by a very powerful federal government under the Constitution. So it's always good to know the kind of differences and similarities between these two rebellions in the backcountry of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

Important point: disagreements are going to develop over the new nation's political, economic, and social identity. People are not going to agree what this young nation should look like. And really the domestic disagreements revolve around the Secretary of the Treasury's financial program -- Alexander Hamilton. And you have the assumption plan where the federal government is going to be taking the state debt, the excise taxes, the high tariffs, and the big one -- the bank. The bank is going to create all sorts of issues, and constitutionally there is disagreements about whether or not the government can do it or not.

Hamilton is doing these programs because he favors a strong central government. He is a Federalist. He favors developing the nation's economy and particularly manufacturing. And they believe in a loose interpretation of the Constitution. On the other side is Jefferson and his homeboys -- the Democratic-Republicans -- who are going to reject Hamilton's plan. They're going to accept some things after compromise, but they favor a weak central government. They are going to favor agriculture, and they believe in a strict interpretation of the constitution -- meaning only if it's in there can the government do it. So these disagreements reveal the growth of political parties.

In fact, federal versus state government can best be seen in the Alien and Sedition Acts, which is passed during the administration of John Adams by a Federalist-controlled Congress. And these basically, especially the Sedition Acts, create all sorts of controversy. You have the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions written by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and basically in that they say the states of Kentucky and Virginia have the right of nullification -- they, the states, can ignore a federal law (in this case the Sedition Acts) if they feel it's unconstitutional. And this battle between federal and state will continue throughout American history.

Some foreign disagreements to keep in mind for period 3: you're going to have the French Revolution in 1789. France goes to war with Europe. There's all sorts of concerns in America about whether or not we should support this French Revolution. And Washington decides the young nation should stay the heck out of Europeans' war, and he issues the Proclamation of Neutrality. You have Citizen Genêt who comes over to the United States and tries to challenge that neutrality. He is eventually kind of scolded. You have the XYZ Affair under John Adams where we try to negotiate, and this leads to an international incident. And then the Quasi-War happens where you have a war between the United States and France, and impressment taking place. And eventually the Convention of 1800 ending the Franco-American alliance that had been around since 1778.

You also have drama with England. The Treaty of Paris which ended the American Revolution did not end our problem with them. They had forts on American soil. They were giving guns to Native Americans. There was impressment of American sailors and ships. And all of this kind of eventually tries to get resolved by Jay's Treaty, but it doesn't really work, and you have a lot of anger especially amongst Democratic-Republicans over Jay's Treaty.

You have drama with Spain. They had closed off the Mississippi River under the Articles of Confederation. They had actually questioned the boundaries between the US and Florida. And eventually some of that gets solved with Pinckney's Treaty. And make sure you know about Washington's Farewell Address where he says stay the heck out of permanent alliances and "political parties suck."

These kind of issues not only are they challenges for the young nation, but they cause further divisions between the Democratic-Republicans who tended to favor France and the Federalists who tended to favor England.

Of course, this period 3 ends with 1800, which is a significant year in American history because it is the election of 1800. The Democratic-Republican party wins -- Thomas Jefferson becomes president. And it is significant and sometimes referred to as the Revolution of 1800 because it is the first peaceful transfer of power between political parties.

Now something we left off but really important throughout all this stuff -- something that was not peaceful unfortunately -- is Native Americans are going to play a key role, and they are going to respond to European and American settlements in a variety of ways. For instance, during the French and Indian War, largely the native people are going to join the French and largely be on the side of the French. The English and the colonies are going to try under the Albany Plan to get the Iroquois to support them. Ultimately they will, but the French are going to be defeated, causing all sorts of problems.

In fact, following the French defeat, they've lost an important ally in North America. You have Pontiac's Rebellion where Pontiac and other natives start rebelling, trying to keep out settlers from their land, which leads to the British passing the Proclamation of 1763.

During the American Revolution, many native people sided with the British once again hoping to keep the colonists out of their land. Ultimately that decision backfires because at the Treaty of Paris, the United States' boundaries are from the Atlantic to the Mississippi River. No one asks the native people living in those areas are they cool with that.

During this period of time, you also have in 1783-1785 a man by the name of Chief Little Turtle forming the Western Confederacy, and he is going to lead resistance in the old Northwest against American expansion. And of course unfortunately, the Battle of Fallen Timbers -- the native resistance in the old west is going to be crushed, and the Treaty of Greenville is going to mark the end of native resistance in that region.

And meanwhile over on the big old west coast, Spanish missionaries are creeping up the coast of California forming these missions, converting the native people to Catholicism. So native history is an important component of period 3 APUSH.

Finally, we're almost done. Keep in mind during this time we have the expansion of the United States. Eventually remember the Northwest Ordinances -- those things that were really successful under the Articles of Confederation. The United States is expanding its territory, and they ban slavery and they allow public education in those regions. However, slavery even though it ends in the north in the middle states following the American Revolution slowly, it is going to continue to expand. It's going to be protected under the Constitution. The slave trade is going to continue for another 20 years, and slavery is going to continue to be a fact of life throughout the South and as they move west.

And of course as the nation grows, just as the colonies were different because of unique geographic, environmental factors, the regional identities are going to continue and they're going to be strengthened between the northern states, the southern states, and the western states. And we're going to see this play out in APUSH period 4 and five.

Woo! We finished finally -- APUSH period 3. That's a quick rundown. Make sure you read your book, check out my other videos, subscribe to the channel if you haven't done so, click like on the video, tell all the APUSH homies out in the world to check out Jo Productions, and most importantly always stand up for what you believe in -- you never know, you may end up in a school textbook one day like my crazy self. Peace!
