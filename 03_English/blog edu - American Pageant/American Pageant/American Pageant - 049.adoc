What's up APUSH crew? 怎么了，美国历史课程（APUSH）的同学们？Today we're going to break down 剖析 period 6 in the APUSH curriculum 课程. We're going from 1865 to 1898. If you want to get real super smart on these topics, click any one of these four videos and you'll get all the real nitty-gritty details 具体细节. Today we're going to try to go quick.

One important topic is post-Civil War expansion 内战后的扩张. In the post-Civil War era 时代, there's a lot of economic opportunities 经济机会 out in the west. These include mining 采矿, farming, and the cattle industry 畜牧业. And the government had actually established policies 制定政策 such as the Homestead Act 宅地法 -- if you went west, you can get 160 acres 英亩 of land. It's not necessarily the best land, but you can get this land for relatively cheap. The Pacific Railroad Act 太平洋铁路法案 which established the route 路线 for the Transcontinental Railroad 横贯大陆铁路. So the government is facilitating 促进 the movement of people west. In fact, the government is very active in this process because it is going to be the government unfortunately removing the native people, forcing them onto reservations 保留地 -- more on that in a moment -- and giving land and grant subsidies 补贴 to the railroad companies for this expansion to take place. So it's important you know the role of the government in this western expansion.

As the nation is expanding west, there is a growing conservationist movement 环保主义运动 in the country. They're starting to realize that we need to preserve 保护 some of our natural resources 自然资源, and there's really a battle between government agencies 政府机构 and conservationist groups versus corporate interests 企业利益 who want to make money off the water and the air and other things. And who's really going to control these natural resources? You do have the Department of the Interior 内政部 -- it was established in 1849, and its job was responsible for the management and conservation of federal land 联邦土地 and other natural resources. The U.S. Fish Commission 美国鱼类委员会 is established in 1871 -- it's created to preserve the fisheries 渔场 of the U.S. so we don't overfish 过度捕捞 and run out. And really a huge person in the conservationist movement is John Muir. In 1892, he establishes the Sierra Club 塞拉俱乐部, and its whole purpose was to fight for conservation and preservation of natural resources. And we're really going to see in period 7 -- Theodore Roosevelt is going to be the guy who's going to make this happen on a federal level.

Unfortunately, conservation 保护 is not going to be something the government's interested in when it comes to Native Americans. Their policy kind of can go into two categories 类别 during this time period -- violent conflict 暴力冲突 or assimilation policies 同化政策. There's a whole bunch of battles that take place -- really they're massacres 大屠杀. The Sand Creek Massacre 桑德克里克大屠杀 -- the Colorado militia 民兵 goes in, attacks and kills over 100 native people, many of them women and children. The Battle of Little Bighorn 1876 小大角羊战役 -- the Sioux tribe 苏族 inspired by the leadership of Sitting Bull 坐牛 kills Colonel Custer and his men in the seventh cavalry 第七骑兵团. It's also known as Custer's Last Stand 卡斯特的最后抵抗. However, the government's going to come in after the Battle of Little Bighorn and round up 围捕 the Sioux resistance. There's a Ghost Dance Movement 鬼舞运动 which begins amongst the Sioux Indians in the Dakota territory where they feel like this is a kind of cultural revival 文化复兴 -- they're going to get rid of 摆脱 the white man, the buffalo are going to return, and all is going to be well. However, the U.S. government is going to come in with the Battle of Wounded Knee 伤膝河战役 which is the last major Indian battle in 1890 where the U.S. Army goes into the Dakotas and kills over 200 native people. Once again, this is more of a massacre than it is a battle.

Assimilation policies 同化政策 -- tribes were often times forced onto reservations such as the Great Sioux Reservation, and this was supported by laws such as the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 1887年道斯土地分配法. Its whole purpose was to end tribal ownership of land 部落土地所有权. They want the government wants native tribes to dissolve 解散, and they want to force them onto private farms 私人农场. We also see various Native American schools opening up with the support of the federal government, and their goal -- their duty -- was to assimilate 同化 native people. "Kill the Indian, save the man" was the idea in these schools.

Another thing happening during this post-Civil War era is industrialization 工业化. You have large scale production 大规模生产, tremendous technological change 巨大的技术变革, all sorts of new inventions making life easier, improved communication networks 通信网络, and you see business during this time seeking to maximize the exploitation 最大化利用 of a growing labor force 劳动力 and natural resources. Key to this though is industry leaders such as Carnegie -- of course the steel guy -- and Rockefeller -- oil -- who are seeking to dominate their respective industries 各自的行业 through a variety of techniques 手段. You got horizontal integration 横向整合 being used where you control all competition in a particular industry -- in other words, you're consolidating 合并 all your competitors to monopolize a market 垄断市场. Vertical integration 纵向整合 -- you control all aspects of production of manufacturing from extracting the raw materials 提取原材料 to selling the finished product 成品. And in order to eliminate or reduce competition, business leaders sought to establish monopolies 垄断, trusts 托拉斯 and pools 联营. They also believed and defended their wealth with ideas such as social Darwinism 社会达尔文主义 -- meaning the rich are rich because they're hardworking and the poor are poor because they're lazy or inferior 劣等的 -- and this is this idea of survival of the fittest 适者生存. In fact, one of the other key aspects 方面 of this period is advocating for 倡导 laissez-faire policies 自由放任政策 -- in other words, the government should not regulate business 监管企业.

It's important you know about the regional differences 地区差异. So you have the west experiencing its own economic growth and population growth. The north and the Midwest is industrializing, but you also have the south. And after reconstruction 重建, there was an attempt at industrializing the southern economy -- some refer to it as the New South 新南方. And there is a growth in the number of textile industries 纺织业 in the south. Remember, the south was largely agriculture 农业, so you have textile mills 纺织厂 and factories coming into southern states. However, the south remained -- even though you have this idea of the New South -- the south remained primarily agriculture. In fact, tenant farming 佃农 farming and sharecropping 分成制农业 continue to be the predominant labor system 主要的劳动制度 of the southern economy. And it's really African-American laborers 劳动者 and poor whites -- but really black laborers -- who are doing much of this work in the farming and sharecropping.

Now during this time during this Industrial Revolution 工业革命, there's a lot of good happening. Industrialization and urbanization 城市化 -- people moving to the cities largely because they're looking for jobs -- they're bringing about new economic opportunities for immigrants 移民 and workers. People are going from rural areas 农村地区 to urban areas 城市地区. Immigrants are coming from other countries looking for these new economic opportunities, and the workforce 劳动力队伍 is expanding. We also see this time period presenting new career opportunities 职业机会 in spite of 尽管 a lot of social prejudice 社会偏见 for African-Americans and women and other disadvantaged groups 弱势群体.

Now a real key point in period 6 is this -- while industrialization brought numerous opportunities to workers and dramatically expanded the workforce, low wages 低工资 and dangerous working conditions 危险的工作条件 continued to be a problem. So yes, there were jobs, but life was very difficult for workers. And as a result of this, workers are going to fight back 反抗. They're going to fight back to try to change this reality, and you're going to see workers organize 组织起来. You have the Knights of Labor 劳工骑士团 you should know about -- founded in 1869 by Terence Powderly -- is one of the key figures 关键人物 in this union 工会. They opened up the union to all workers -- skilled and unskilled workers 熟练和非熟练工人. This was unique 独特的. Women and African-Americans were also allowed to join the union. However, after the Haymarket Riot 干草市场暴动 where labor unions were kind of attached to radical movements 激进运动, they are going to suffer a decline in numbers 数量减少.

The big one though is the American Federation of Labor -- the AFL -- founded in 1886. Make sure you know about Samuel Gompers. They're going to focus on skilled workers 熟练工人, and they're not really interested in social reforms 社会改革. They focus on bread and butter issues 生计问题 -- practical things like wages, working conditions and hours. And by 1900, it was the largest union in the country.

Now workers -- if you're going to evaluate 评估 the labor movement 劳工运动 during the Gilded Age 镀金时代 during this industrial era -- they are going to have some successes and failures. Workers did form local and national unions that did directly confront 对抗 growing corporate power 企业权力, and you're going to get the beginning of a national labor movement 全国性劳工运动 and the rise of union leaders such as Eugene Debs -- you're going to see him at the Pullman Strike 普尔曼罢工 -- and Mother Jones in the Knights of Labor. However, this is going to be followed by a lot of failures. Homestead Strike 1892 霍姆斯特德罢工 -- workers at Carnegie Steel are defeated during a strike. Henry Frick is going to call out the guards, and the union is going to be busted 瓦解. Pullman Strike 1894 普尔曼罢工 -- President Cleveland is going to use the army in a court injunction 法院禁令 to defeat the strike. Eugene Debs will be thrown in jail. And a big problem for the unions was also division 分裂 amongst themselves. You have division between skilled and unskilled workers, ethnic and racial groups 族裔和种族群体. Very often workers unions were against immigrants like the Chinese in the west, so you're going to have problems organizing. You're also going to have hostility 敌意 from corporations. They're going to be hiring Pinkerton guards 平克顿警卫, yellow dog contracts 黄狗合同（不加入工会的合同）pledging you won't form a union, and the government is going to be on the sidelines 袖手旁观 offering no protection because of the laissez-faire policies of the time period.

It's important you know that the lives of farmers was also changing as they had to adapt to 适应 mechanized agriculture 机械化农业. They had to buy all this new equipment which made them more efficient in producing crops and a dependence on 依赖 powerful railroad companies. Farmers are going to have a lot of problems. As they become more efficient at growing crops, as agriculture becomes more and more recognized, prices are going to fall. You're also going to see unfair railroad business practices 不公平的铁路商业行为. Railroad companies will often times charge small farmers more than large farmers. The high cost of machinery  machinery 机器 is going to cause huge amount of debt 债务. Tight money supply 资金紧张 -- not having access to cheap money -- is going to be a concern. And of course high tariff policies 高关税政策 amongst many Republican administrations. All of these things are going to cause farmers to also organize.

Couple of key farmers groups you should know about. The Grange Movement 格兰其运动 is going to start off organizing social and educational activities, but later on they're going to lobby 游说 the state legislators 州议员 in places such as Illinois for reforms. We're going to see how that works out in a moment. The Farmers' Alliance 农民联盟 will follow in the 1870s -- really in Texas. They're going to be split though because in the south you're going to have division. African-American farmers are going to have to form their own farmers group called the Colored Farmers' Alliance, and they're going to ignore the plight 困境 and the problems of tenant farmers 佃农. And the big one you should know about is the one that actually forms into a political party 政党 -- the Populist Party 人民党. They're going to be key. Their strength is going to be amongst farmers but also amongst workers, and their platform 纲领 is pretty varied 多样的 in what they want. And they're really calling for political reform 政治改革 and a stronger role of the government in the economy. For instance, they want the government to own the railroad companies. Two, they want the free and unlimited coinage of silver 自由无限铸造银币 to increase the money supply 货币供应 so that farmers have access to cheap money. Three, they want to have an income tax 所得税 which the rich would pay more for. They want to have political reform where people would have the direct election of senators 直接选举参议员 -- this was not the case at this time. And five, they also want reforms such as the initiative 创制权 and referendums 公投 so that you could take away power from these powerful business interests and these political machines 政治机器.

Which leads us to the government and the role of the government. Mark Twain famously called this era the Gilded Age 镀金时代, and what he meant was below the surface 表面之下, things are not as good as they seem. There was rampant corruption 腐败猖獗 and problems in this time period. Politics during the Gilded Age was tied heavily to big business 大企业, and remember there's a laissez-faire philosophy 自由放任哲学 which prevented the government from actively regulating the economy 监管经济. But it's important you understand that you're going to see the start of government regulation 政府监管 during this period. During the Grange movement, they got laws passed -- Granger laws 格兰其法 -- which protected farmers against abuse of the railroad industry 铁路行业的滥用. In the case Munn v. Illinois, the court ruled that states could in fact regulate the railroads. However, that's overturned 推翻 in the Wabash case in 1886 where the court rules the states cannot regulate interstate commerce 州际贸易 -- trade between different states. And that's going to eventually lead to the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act 州际商业法 which is going to regulate -- the federal government is going to regulate trade between different states. In the beginning it's going to be ineffective 无效的, but it's going to be an important precedent 先例.

The other big one you should know about is the Sherman Antitrust Act 谢尔曼反托拉斯法. This is going to outlaw 取缔 trusts and other monopolies that fix prices 操纵价格 and restrain trade 限制贸易. And unfortunately for labor unions, it's going to be used against them in the beginning -- not against the monopolies. That will change however with the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt during the Progressive Movement 进步运动 in period 7.

Another important thing that's happening during this time period is the movement of people. And we're talking about large scale internal -- within the United States -- and external migration 外部移民 is taking place. We already saw the internal settlers 定居者 seeking opportunities on the frontier 边疆 out in the west -- you know, and remember these opportunities are available as a result of the Homestead Act and the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. They are going west. You're going to see the mass movement of people to urban areas 城市地区 as they're looking for jobs and hoping to get economic opportunities. African-Americans are going to really begin to move out of the south -- slowly at first in the around the 1890s, but it's going to increase especially during World War I and World War II -- leaving Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法, segregation 种族隔离, and heading to northern cities. This will eventually be called the Great Migration 大迁徙. And you're going to have external migration of people taking place -- large scale immigration 大规模移民 from China during this period. This will slow down dramatically with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act 排华法案 -- make sure you know about that. And after 1880, you're going to have a different kind of immigrant coming in from Europe -- the so-called new immigrants 新移民 from southern and eastern Europe. And we're talking places like Russia, Italy, Poland -- where my peeps are from -- and others. They are largely going to settle in urban areas looking for job opportunities that are presented as a result of the Industrial Revolution.

There is going to be a response to this changing immigration, and that is going to be the rise of nativism 本土主义. In fact, during this time period there's going to be various attempts to exclude 排斥 and keep out immigrants. We've already heard about the Chinese Exclusion Act effectively shutting out Chinese immigration to the United States. The American Protective Association 美国保护协会 was an anti-Catholic group 反天主教团体 made up of American Protestants that wanted to get restrictions and limits on the number of Catholics coming in. And you have various proposals for literacy tests 识字测试 which was proposed to keep southern and eastern immigrants out of the U.S. And the idea here is that these immigrants are undesirable 不受欢迎的 -- they're going to undermine 破坏 and ruin the American way.

There are going to be very challenges of urbanization 城市化 and immigration. Cities were often divided among classes between the rich and the poor, races, ethnicities 种族, ethnic groups 族裔群体. For example, the Italians in Little Italy, the Chinese in San Francisco are going to form their own communities and cultures. Low wages and dangerous working conditions kept many workers in extreme poverty 极端贫困. Since you have so many workers confined 聚集 in these cities, unskilled work leads to low wages. There's going to be a contrast 对比 during this time between the poor and the wealthy. And the wealthy are enjoying lives of conspicuous consumption 炫耀性消费 -- they're able to spend huge amounts of money to show off publicly their economic power and status 地位. That's not the reality for the majority of people living in the cities. In fact, many people in cities like New York are going to be living in tenement housing 廉租公寓. It was extremely common, and Jacob Riis is going to document 记录 this in his famous piece "How the Other Half Lives" in
1890 -- giving a reality check 现实警示 to many Americans. Child labor 童工 is becoming increasingly common during this time. And immigrants attempted to both assimilate 同化 -- for example learn English, adapt to mainstream American culture -- while also maintaining their own unique cultural identities 文化身份. And political machines 政治集团 dominated city life by exchanging welfare services 福利服务 -- food and other things and jobs -- for political support 政治支持. And this creates all sorts of corruption 腐败 and fraud 欺诈 and waste 浪费.

However, these challenges are going to begin to be addressed during the Gilded Age. You have the Gospel of Wealth 财富福音 which was a belief that the wealthy had a moral obligation 道德义务 to help out those less fortunate. Andrew Carnegie talked about this in his piece "Wealth." Settlement house movement 定居点运动 sought to relieve urban poverty 缓解城市贫困 and provide assistance to immigrants. And you see this with Jane Addams' Hull House 赫尔馆 in Chicago -- helping immigrants transition to 适应 life in America. The Social Gospel Movement 社会福音运动 challenged the dominant corporate ethic 企业伦理 of the time, and this was a group of Christians which said Christians had a responsibility to deal with urban poverty and to help alleviate 减轻 it. The Socialist Party 社会党 and other organizations actually challenged capitalism 资本主义 itself -- called it exploitive 剥削的 and critiqued 批判 it. You had Edward Bellamy and his "Looking Backward" -- a utopian socialist society 乌托邦社会主义社会 is depicted 描绘 in this novel, and in this society they have fixed the social and economic injustices 不公 of the time. In fact, the Socialist Party is going to run candidates 竞选候选人 for political offices at both the state and national level. And eventually -- and this is in period 7 -- the effort to reform these problems will eventually lead to a movement known as the Progressive Movement 进步运动 in the 1890s. And we got some videos on that as well -- check them out.

Finally, not only are there going to be people addressing the economic problems of the Gilded Age, you're going to have people addressing the social ones as well. The National American Woman Suffrage Association -- NAWSA -- sought to secure the right to vote 选举权 for women -- the right of suffrage. You have people like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Carrie Chapman Catt working tirelessly 不知疲倦地 throughout this time period trying to get the right to vote. Various African-American leaders sought to advance the cause of civil rights 民权事业. Important one for period 6 is Booker T. Washington, and he advocated 主张 African-Americans should acquire vocational skills 职业技能 -- job skills -- to gain self-respect 自尊 and economic security 经济保障. He established the Tuskegee Institute 塔斯基吉学院 to try to accomplish this goal. And Ida B. Wells was very active in not only the women's rights movement but also in the campaign against lynching 私刑.

各位APUSH的同学们，大家好！今天我们要来分析APUSH课程的第六个时期，时间跨度从1865年到1898年。如果你们想深入了解这些主题，点击这四个视频中的任何一个，就能获得所有细致入微的细节。今天我们尽量快速过一遍。

一个重要的议题是, 内战后的扩张。**在内战后的时代，西部存在着大量的经济机会，**包括采矿业、农业和畜牧业。**#政府实际上制定了诸如《宅地法》之类的政策——如果你去西部，就能获得160英亩的土地。#**这不一定是最肥沃的土地，但你们可以相对便宜地获得这片土地。**《太平洋铁路法案》则确定了横贯大陆铁路的路线。因此，政府正在促进人们向西迁移。**事实上，政府在这个过程中非常积极，因为**它将不幸地驱逐当地居民，强迫他们进入保留地**——稍后会详细介绍——并向铁路公司提供土地和补贴，以促进这种扩张。因此，了解政府在西部扩张中的作用非常重要。

随着国家向西扩张，国内的自然资源保护运动日益壮大。人们开始意识到我们需要保护一些自然资源，**政府机构和自然资源保护团体, 与想要从水、空气和其他资源中获利的企业利益之间, 存在着真正的斗争。谁将真正控制这些自然资源？**你们有内政部——它成立于1849年，其职责是负责联邦土地和其他自然资源的 quản lý 和保护。美国渔业委员会成立于1871年——它的成立是为了保护美国的渔业资源，以防止过度捕捞导致资源枯竭。而约翰·缪尔是自然资源保护运动中一位非常重要的人物。1892年，他创立了塞拉俱乐部，其宗旨是为自然资源的保护和保存而奋斗。我们将在第七时期真正看到——西奥多·罗斯福将成为在联邦层面实现这一目标的人。

**不幸的是，当涉及到美洲原住民时，政府对保护并不感兴趣。**在此期间，他们的政策大致可以分为两类——暴力冲突或同化政策。发生了一系列战斗——实际上是屠杀。 +
沙溪大屠杀——科罗拉多州民兵进入，袭击并杀害了100多名当地居民，其中许多是妇女和儿童。 +
1876年的小比格霍恩战役——苏族部落在坐牛的领导下, 杀死了卡斯特上校和他的第七骑兵团士兵。这也被称为卡斯特的最后抵抗。然而，政府将在小比格霍恩战役后前, 来镇压苏族的抵抗。 “鬼舞运动”在达科他地区的苏族印第安人中兴起，他们认为这是一种文化复兴——他们将摆脱白人，野牛将回来，一切都会好起来。然而，美国政府将在1890年的"伤膝河战役"中采取行动，这是最后一次主要的印第安人战役，美国陆军进入达科他地区，杀害了200多名当地居民。再一次，这更像是一场屠杀而不是一场战斗。

**同化政策——部落经常被迫进入保留地，**例如"大苏族保留地"，而**这得到了1887年《道斯分割法》等法律的支持。它的全部目的是结束"部落对土地的所有权"。他们希望政府解散当地部落，并强迫他们进入私人农场。**我们还看到在联邦政府的支持下，各种"美洲原住民学校"开办，他们的目标——他们的职责——是同化当地居民。这些学校的理念是“杀死印第安人，拯救这个人”。

**内战后时代的另一件事, 是工业化。**你们看到了**大规模生产、巨大的技术变革、各种使生活更轻松的新发明、改进的通信网络，**而且你们看到, 当时的商业寻求最大限度地利用不断增长的劳动力和自然资源。然而，**关键在于像卡内基（当然是钢铁大王）和洛克菲勒（石油大王）这样的行业领导者，他们正试图通过各种技术来控制各自的行业。**你们看到了横向整合的使用，即控制特定行业的所有竞争——换句话说，你们正在合并所有竞争对手, 以垄断市场。纵向整合——你们控制从原材料提取到成品销售的生产制造的所有环节。**为了消除或减少竞争，商业领袖试图建立垄断、托拉斯和卡特尔。他们还用"社会达尔文主义"等思想来相信和捍卫**他们的财富——意思是富人之所以富有, 是因为他们勤奋，而穷人之所以贫穷, 是因为他们懒惰或低劣——这就是"适者生存"的思想。*事实上，#这个时期的另一个关键方面是倡导"自由放任政策"——换句话说，政府不应该监管商业。#*

了解地区差异非常重要。因此，西部正在经历自身的经济增长和人口增长。北部和中西部正在工业化，但你们也有南部。重建后，人们试图使南方经济工业化——有些人称之为“新南方”。南方纺织工业的数量有所增长。记住，**南方主要以农业为主，所以你们看到了纺织厂和工厂进入南方各州。然而，**南方仍然——即使你们有“新南方”的想法——*南方仍然主要是农业*。事实上，佃农制和分成制, 继续是南方经济的主要劳动制度。而真正从事大部分农业和分成制工作的，是非裔美国劳工, 和贫穷白人——但主要是黑人劳工。

在工业革命时期，发生了很多好事。工业化和城市化——人们涌向城市, 主要是因为他们正在寻找工作——它们为移民和工人带来了新的经济机会。人们从农村地区, 前往城市地区。移民从其他国家来到这里, 寻找新的经济机会，劳动力队伍正在扩大。*尽管非裔美国人、妇女和其他弱势群体面临许多社会偏见，但我们仍然看到这个时期呈现出新的职业机会。*

现在，第六时期的一个真正关键点是——虽然工业化为工人带来了无数机会, 并极大地扩大了劳动力队伍，**但低工资和危险的工作条件, 仍然是一个问题。**因此**，是的，有工作，但工人的生活非常艰难。结果，工人将反击。他们将反击以试图改变这种现实，你们将看到"工人组织"起来。**你们应该了解"劳工骑士团"——由特伦斯·鲍德利于1869年创立——是这个工会的关键人物之一。他们向所有工人开放工会——包括熟练和非熟练工人。这是独特的。妇女和非裔美国人也被允许加入工会。然而，在干草市场暴动之后，*由于工会与激进运动联系在一起，他们的会员人数将下降。*

然而，最重要的是"美国劳工联合会"（AFL）——成立于1886年。确保你们了解塞缪尔·冈珀斯。他们将专注于熟练工人，并且对社会改革不太感兴趣。他们专注于实际问题——例如工资、工作条件和工时。到1900年，它是美国最大的工会。

现在，如果你们要评估镀金时代（工业时代）的劳工运动，他们将取得一些成功和失败。工人确实组建了地方和全国性的工会，这些工会直接对抗日益增长的企业权力，你们将看到全国性劳工运动的开始以及像尤金·德布斯（你们将在普尔曼罢工中看到他）和劳工骑士团的“琼斯妈妈”这样的工会领导人的崛起。然而，这之后将是许多失败。1892年的霍姆斯特德罢工——卡内基钢铁公司的工人在罢工中失败。亨利·弗里克将召集警卫，工会将瓦解。1894年的普尔曼罢工——克利夫兰总统将利用军队和法院禁令来镇压罢工。尤金·德布斯将被投入监狱。工会的一个大问题也是他们内部的分裂。你们看到了熟练和非熟练工人、不同种族和民族群体之间的分裂。通常，工会反对像西部的中国人这样的移民，因此你们将面临组织问题。你们还将面临来自企业的敌意。他们将雇用平克顿侦探、强迫签订“黄狗合同”（保证不加入工会），而政府由于当时的自由放任政策而袖手旁观，不提供任何保护。

重要的是你们知道，农民的生活也在发生变化，他们必须适应机械化农业。他们不得不购买所有这些新设备，这提高了他们的作物生产效率，但也使他们依赖强大的铁路公司。农民将面临许多问题。随着他们种植作物的效率越来越高，随着农业越来越被认可，价格将下跌。你们还将看到不公平的铁路商业行为。铁路公司通常向小农户收取的费用高于大农户。高昂的机械成本将导致巨额债务。货币供应紧张——无法获得廉价资金——将成为一个令人担忧的问题。当然，还有许多共和党政府实施的高关税政策。所有这些都将导致农民也组织起来。

你们应该了解几个关键的农民团体。“格兰奇运动”最初将组织社交和教育活动，但后来他们将在伊利诺伊州等地游说州议员进行改革。我们稍后会看到结果如何。“农民联盟”将在1870年代——实际上是在德克萨斯州——跟进。然而，他们将分裂，因为在南方你们将看到分裂。非裔美国农民将不得不组建自己的农民团体，称为“有色人种农民联盟”，他们将忽视佃农的困境和问题。你们应该了解的最重要的是那个实际组建成政党的团体——人民党。他们将是关键。他们的力量将来自农民以及工人，他们的纲领在他们想要的东西方面相当多样化。他们实际上呼吁政治改革和政府在经济中发挥更强大的作用。例如，他们希望政府拥有铁路公司。第二，他们希望自由和无限地铸造白银以增加货币供应，以便农民能够获得廉价资金。第三，他们希望实行累进所得税，富人将支付更多。他们希望进行政治改革，人民将直接选举参议员——当时情况并非如此。第五，他们还希望进行诸如倡议和公民投票之类的改革，以便能够从这些强大的商业利益和政治机器手中夺取权力。

这就引出了政府和政府的角色。马克·吐温曾著名地将这个时代称为“镀金时代”，他的意思是表面之下，事情并不像看起来那么好。在这个时期存在着猖獗的腐败和问题。镀金时代的政治与大企业紧密相连，记住，存在着自由放任的哲学，这阻止了政府积极监管经济。但重要的是你们要理解，你们将在这个时期看到政府监管的开始。在格兰奇运动期间，他们通过了法律——格兰奇法——这些法律保护农民免受铁路行业的虐待。在芒恩诉伊利诺伊州案中，法院裁定各州实际上可以监管铁路。然而，这在1886年的沃巴什案中被推翻，法院裁定各州不能监管州际贸易——不同州之间的贸易。这将最终导致《州际商务法》的通过，该法案将监管——联邦政府将监管不同州之间的贸易。起初它将是无效的，但它将是一个重要的先例。

你们应该了解的另一个重要法案是《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》。这将取缔那些固定价格和限制贸易的托拉斯和其他垄断组织。不幸的是，对于工会来说，它最初将被用来对付他们——而不是对付垄断组织。然而，这种情况将在第七时期进步运动期间西奥多·罗斯福总统执政期间发生改变。

这一时期发生的另一个重要事情是人口的流动。我们谈论的是大规模的国内（美国境内）和国际移民正在发生。我们已经看到了国内定居者在西部边疆寻求机会——你们知道，记住这些机会是由于《宅地法》和横贯大陆铁路的建成而提供的。他们正在向西迁移。你们将看到大量人口涌向城市地区，因为他们正在寻找工作并希望获得经济机会。非裔美国人将真正开始离开南方——最初在1890年代左右速度缓慢，但尤其是在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战期间，速度将加快——他们离开吉姆·克劳法、种族隔离，前往北方城市。这最终将被称为大迁徙。你们还将看到国际移民的发生——在此期间来自中国的大规模移民。随着《排华法案》的通过，这种情况将急剧减缓——确保你们了解该法案。1880年之后，你们将看到来自欧洲的不同类型的移民——所谓的来自南欧和东欧的新移民。我们谈论的是像俄罗斯、意大利、波兰——我的祖籍地——以及其他地方。他们主要将定居在城市地区，寻找工业革命带来的就业机会。

对这种不断变化的移民将会有反应，那就是本土主义的兴起。事实上，在此期间，将会有各种试图排斥和阻止移民的尝试。我们已经听说过《排华法案》有效地阻止了中国移民进入美国。美国保护协会是一个由美国新教徒组成的反天主教团体，他们希望限制进入美国的的天主教徒人数。你们还有各种关于文化程度测试的提议，这些提议旨在阻止南欧和东欧的移民进入美国。这里的想法是这些移民是不受欢迎的——他们将破坏和摧毁美国的生活方式。

城市化和移民将带来非常严峻的挑战。城市通常在富人和穷人、不同种族、民族和族裔群体之间存在阶级分化。例如，小意大利的意大利人、旧金山的中国人将形成他们自己的社区和文化。低工资和危险的工作条件使许多工人处于极度贫困之中。由于如此多的工人聚集在这些城市里，非熟练工作导致低工资。在此期间，贫富差距将非常明显。富人过着炫耀性消费的生活——他们能够花费大量金钱公开炫耀他们的经济实力和地位。但这并不是大多数城市居民的现实。事实上，像纽约这样的城市里，许多人将居住在廉租公寓里。这种情况非常普遍，雅各布·里斯将在他1890年著名的作品《另一半是如何生活的》中记录下这一切——给许多美国人敲响了警钟。童工现象在此期间变得越来越普遍。移民试图同化——例如学习英语，适应美国主流文化——同时也保持他们自己独特的文化认同。政治机器通过用福利服务（食物、其他物品和工作）换取政治支持来控制城市生活。这造成了各种腐败、欺诈和浪费。

然而，镀金时代将开始解决这些挑战。你们有“财富福音”，这是一种认为富人有道义责任帮助那些不幸的人的信念。安德鲁·卡内基在他的文章《财富》中谈到了这一点。睦邻互助运动旨在缓解城市贫困并为移民提供帮助。你们可以看到芝加哥简·亚当斯的赫尔之家——帮助移民适应在美国的生活。“社会福音运动”挑战了当时占主导地位的企业伦理，这是一个基督教团体，他们认为基督徒有责任处理城市贫困并帮助减轻贫困。社会主义政党和其他组织实际上挑战了资本主义本身——称其为剥削性的并对其进行了批判。你们有爱德华·贝拉米和他的《回顾》——这部小说描绘了一个乌托邦式的社会主义社会，在这个社会里，他们已经解决了当时的社会和经济不公。事实上，社会主义政党将在州和国家层面竞选政治职位。最终——这将在第七时期——改革这些问题的努力将最终导致1890年代被称为进步运动的运动。我们也有关于这些的视频——去看看吧。

最后，不仅有人在解决镀金时代的经济问题，也有人在解决社会问题。“全国美国妇女选举权协会”（NAWSA）寻求确保妇女的投票权——选举权。像伊丽莎白·卡迪·斯坦顿和卡丽·查普曼·卡特这样的人在此期间不知疲倦地工作，试图争取投票权。各种非裔美国领导人寻求推进民权事业。第六时期一个重要人物是布克·T·华盛顿，他主张非裔美国人应该学习职业技能——工作技能——以获得自尊和经济保障。他建立了塔斯基吉学院来努力实现这一目标。艾达·B·威尔斯不仅在妇女权利运动中非常活跃，而且还积极参与反对私刑的运动。

What's up APUSH crew? Today we're going to break down period 6 in the APUSH curriculum. We're going from 1865 to 1898. If you want to get real super smart on these topics, click any one of these four videos and you'll get all the real nitty-gritty details. Today we're going to try to go quick.

One important topic is post-Civil War expansion. In the post-Civil War era, there's a lot of economic opportunities out in the west. These include mining, farming, and the cattle industry. And the government had actually established policies such as the Homestead Act -- if you went west, you can get 160 acres of land. It's not necessarily the best land, but you can get this land for relatively cheap. The Pacific Railroad Act which established the route for the Transcontinental Railroad. So the government is facilitating the movement of people west. In fact, the government is very active in this process because it is going to be the government unfortunately removing the native people, forcing them onto reservations -- more on that in a moment -- and giving land and grant subsidies to the railroad companies for this expansion to take place. So it's important you know the role of the government in this western expansion.

As the nation is expanding west, there is a growing conservationist movement in the country. They're starting to realize that we need to preserve some of our natural resources, and there's really a battle between government agencies and conservationist groups versus corporate interests who want to make money off the water and the air and other things. And who's really going to control these natural resources? You do have the Department of the Interior -- it was established in 1849, and its job was responsible for the management and conservation of federal land and other natural resources. The U.S. Fish Commission is established in 1871 -- it's created to preserve the fisheries of the U.S. so we don't overfish and run out. And really a huge person in the conservationist movement is John Muir. In 1892, he establishes the Sierra Club, and its whole purpose was to fight for conservation and preservation of natural resources. And we're really going to see in period 7 -- Theodore Roosevelt is going to be the guy who's going to make this happen on a federal level.

Unfortunately, conservation is not going to be something the government's interested in when it comes to Native Americans. Their policy kind of can go into two categories during this time period -- violent conflict or assimilation policies. There's a whole bunch of battles that take place -- really they're massacres. The Sand Creek Massacre -- the Colorado militia goes in, attacks and kills over 100 native people, many of them women and children. The Battle of Little Bighorn 1876 -- the Sioux tribe inspired by the leadership of Sitting Bull kills Colonel Custer and his men in the seventh cavalry. It's also known as Custer's Last Stand. However, the government's going to come in after the Battle of Little Bighorn and round up the Sioux resistance. There's a Ghost Dance Movement which begins amongst the Sioux Indians in the Dakota territory where they feel like this is a kind of cultural revival -- they're going to get rid of the white man, the buffalo are going to return, and all is going to be well. However, the U.S. government is going to come in with the Battle of Wounded Knee which is the last major Indian battle in 1890 where the U.S. Army goes into the Dakotas and kills over 200 native people. Once again, this is more of a massacre than it is a battle.

Assimilation policies -- tribes were often times forced onto reservations such as the Great Sioux Reservation, and this was supported by laws such as the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887. Its whole purpose was to end tribal ownership of land. They want the government wants native tribes to dissolve, and they want to force them onto private farms. We also see various Native American schools opening up with the support of the federal government, and their goal -- their duty -- was to assimilate native people. "Kill the Indian, save the man" was the idea in these schools.

Another thing happening during this post-Civil War era is industrialization. You have large scale production, tremendous technological change, all sorts of new inventions making life easier, improved communication networks, and you see business during this time seeking to maximize the exploitation of a growing labor force and natural resources. Key to this though is industry leaders such as Carnegie -- of course the steel guy -- and Rockefeller -- oil -- who are seeking to dominate their respective industries through a variety of techniques. You got horizontal integration being used where you control all competition in a particular industry -- in other words, you're consolidating all your competitors to monopolize a market. Vertical integration -- you control all aspects of production of manufacturing from extracting the raw materials to selling the finished product. And in order to eliminate or reduce competition, business leaders sought to establish monopolies, trusts and pools. They also believed and defended their wealth with ideas such as social Darwinism -- meaning the rich are rich because they're hardworking and the poor are poor because they're lazy or inferior -- and this is this idea of survival of the fittest. In fact, one of the other key aspects of this period is advocating for laissez-faire policies -- in other words, the government should not regulate business.

It's important you know about the regional differences. So you have the west experiencing its own economic growth and population growth. The north and the Midwest is industrializing, but you also have the south. And after reconstruction, there was an attempt at industrializing the southern economy -- some refer to it as the New South. And there is a growth in the number of textile industries in the south. Remember, the south was largely agriculture, so you have textile mills and factories coming into southern states. However, the south remained -- even though you have this idea of the New South -- the south remained primarily agriculture. In fact, tenant farming and sharecropping continue to be the predominant labor system of the southern economy. And it's really African-American laborers and poor whites -- but really black laborers -- who are doing much of this work in the farming and sharecropping.

Now during this time during this Industrial Revolution, there's a lot of good happening. Industrialization and urbanization -- people moving to the cities largely because they're looking for jobs -- they're bringing about new economic opportunities for immigrants and workers. People are going from rural areas to urban areas. Immigrants are coming from other countries looking for these new economic opportunities, and the workforce is expanding. We also see this time period presenting new career opportunities in spite of a lot of social prejudice for African-Americans and women and other disadvantaged groups.

Now a real key point in period 6 is this -- while industrialization brought numerous opportunities to workers and dramatically expanded the workforce, low wages and dangerous working conditions continued to be a problem. So yes, there were jobs, but life was very difficult for workers. And as a result of this, workers are going to fight back. They're going to fight back to try to change this reality, and you're going to see workers organize. You have the Knights of Labor you should know about -- founded in 1869 by Terence Powderly -- is one of the key figures in this union. They opened up the union to all workers -- skilled and unskilled workers. This was unique. Women and African-Americans were also allowed to join the union. However, after the Haymarket Riot where labor unions were kind of attached to radical movements, they are going to suffer a decline in numbers.

The big one though is the American Federation of Labor -- the AFL -- founded in 1886. Make sure you know about Samuel Gompers. They're going to focus on skilled workers, and they're not really interested in social reforms. They focus on bread and butter issues -- practical things like wages, working conditions and hours. And by 1900, it was the largest union in the country.

Now workers -- if you're going to evaluate the labor movement during the Gilded Age during this industrial era -- they are going to have some successes and failures. Workers did form local and national unions that did directly confront growing corporate power, and you're going to get the beginning of a national labor movement and the rise of union leaders such as Eugene Debs -- you're going to see him at the Pullman Strike -- and Mother Jones in the Knights of Labor. However, this is going to be followed by a lot of failures. Homestead Strike in 1892 -- workers at Carnegie Steel are defeated during a strike. Henry Frick is going to call out the guards, and the union is going to be busted. Pullman Strike in 1894 -- President Cleveland is going to use the army in a court injunction to defeat the strike. Eugene Debs will be thrown in jail. And a big problem for the unions was also division amongst themselves. You have division between skilled and unskilled workers, ethnic and racial groups. Very often workers unions were against immigrants like the Chinese in the west, so you're going to have problems organizing. You're also going to have hostility from corporations. They're going to be hiring Pinkerton guards, yellow dog contracts pledging you won't form a union, and the government is going to be on the sidelines offering no protection because of the laissez-faire policies of the time period.

It's important you know that the lives of farmers was also changing as they had to adapt to mechanized agriculture. They had to buy all this new equipment which made them more efficient in producing crops and a dependence on powerful railroad companies. Farmers are going to have a lot of problems. As they become more efficient at growing crops, as agriculture becomes more and more recognized, prices are going to fall. You're also going to see unfair railroad business practices. Railroad companies will often times charge small farmers more than large farmers. The high cost of machinery is going to cause huge amount of debt. Tight money supply -- not having access to cheap money -- is going to be a concern. And of course high tariff policies amongst many Republican administrations. All of these things are going to cause farmers to also organize.

Couple of key farmers groups you should know about. The Grange Movement is going to start off organizing social and educational activities, but later on they're going to lobby the state legislators in places such as Illinois for reforms. We're going to see how that works out in a moment. The Farmers' Alliance will follow in the 1870s -- really in Texas. They're going to be split though because in the south you're going to have division. African-American farmers are going to have to form their own farmers group called the Colored Farmers' Alliance, and they're going to ignore the plight and the problems of tenant farmers. And the big one you should know about is the one that actually forms into a political party -- the Populist Party. They're going to be key. Their strength is going to be amongst farmers but also amongst workers, and their platform is pretty varied in what they want. And they're really calling for political reform and a stronger role of the government in the economy. For instance, they want the government to own the railroad companies. Two, they want the free and unlimited coinage of silver to increase the money supply so that farmers have access to cheap money. Three, they want to have an income tax which the rich would pay more for. They want to have political reform where people would have the direct election of senators -- this was not the case at this time. And five, they also want reforms such as the initiative and referendums so that you could take away power from these powerful business interests and these political machines.

Which leads us to the government and the role of the government. Mark Twain famously called this era the Gilded Age, and what he meant was below the surface, things are not as good as they seem. There was rampant corruption and problems in this time period. Politics during the Gilded Age was tied heavily to big business, and remember there's a laissez-faire philosophy which prevented the government from actively regulating the economy. But it's important you understand that you're going to see the start of government regulation during this period. During the Grange movement, they got laws passed -- Granger laws -- which protected farmers against abuse of the railroad industry. In the case Munn v. Illinois, the court ruled that states could in fact regulate the railroads. However, that's overturned in the Wabash case in 1886 where the court rules the states cannot regulate interstate commerce -- trade between different states. And that's going to eventually lead to the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act which is going to regulate -- the federal government is going to regulate trade between different states. In the beginning it's going to be ineffective, but it's going to be an important precedent.

The other big one you should know about is the Sherman Antitrust Act. This is going to outlaw trusts and other monopolies that fix prices and restrain trade. And unfortunately for labor unions, it's going to be used against them in the beginning -- not against the monopolies. That will change however with the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt during the Progressive Movement in period 7.

Another important thing that's happening during this time period is the movement of people. And we're talking about large scale internal -- within the United States -- and external migration is taking place. We already saw the internal settlers seeking opportunities on the frontier out in the west -- you know, and remember these opportunities are available as a result of the Homestead Act and the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. They are going west. You're going to see the mass movement of people to urban areas as they're looking for jobs and hoping to get economic opportunities. African-Americans are going to really begin to move out of the south -- slowly at first in the around the 1890s, but it's going to increase especially during World War I and World War II -- leaving Jim Crow laws, segregation, and heading to northern cities. This will eventually be called the Great Migration. And you're going to have external migration of people taking place -- large scale immigration from China during this period. This will slow down dramatically with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act -- make sure you know about that. And after 1880, you're going to have a different kind of immigrant coming in from Europe -- the so-called new immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. And we're talking places like Russia, Italy, Poland -- where my peeps are from -- and others. They are largely going to settle in urban areas looking for job opportunities that are presented as a result of the Industrial Revolution.

There is going to be a response to this changing immigration, and that is going to be the rise of nativism. In fact, during this time period there's going to be various attempts to exclude and keep out immigrants. We've already heard about the Chinese Exclusion Act effectively shutting out Chinese immigration to the United States. The American Protective Association was an anti-Catholic group made up of American Protestants that wanted to get restrictions and limits on the number of Catholics coming in. And you have various proposals for literacy tests which was proposed to keep southern and eastern immigrants out of the U.S. And the idea here is that these immigrants are undesirable -- they're going to undermine and ruin the American way.

There are going to be very challenges of urbanization and immigration. Cities were often divided among classes between the rich and the poor, races, ethnicities, ethnic groups. For example, the Italians in Little Italy, the Chinese in San Francisco are going to form their own communities and cultures. Low wages and dangerous working conditions kept many workers in extreme poverty. Since you have so many workers confined in these cities, unskilled work leads to low wages. There's going to be a contrast during this time between the poor and the wealthy. And the wealthy are enjoying lives of conspicuous consumption -- they're able to spend huge amounts of money to show off publicly their economic power and status. That's not the reality for the majority of people living in the cities. In fact, many people in cities like New York are going to be living in tenement housing. It was extremely common, and Jacob Riis is going to document this in his famous piece "How the Other Half Lives" in 1890 -- giving a reality check to many Americans. Child labor is becoming increasingly common during this time. And immigrants attempted to both assimilate -- for example learn English, adapt to mainstream American culture -- while also maintaining their own unique cultural identities. And political machines dominated city life by exchanging welfare services -- food and other things and jobs -- for political support. And this creates all sorts of corruption and fraud and waste.

However, these challenges are going to begin to be addressed during the Gilded Age. You have the Gospel of Wealth which was a belief that the wealthy had a moral obligation to help out those less fortunate. Andrew Carnegie talked about this in his piece "Wealth." Settlement house movement sought to relieve urban poverty and provide assistance to immigrants. And you see this with Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago -- helping immigrants transition to life in America. The Social Gospel Movement challenged the dominant corporate ethic of the time, and this was a group of Christians which said Christians had a responsibility to deal with urban poverty and to help alleviate it. The Socialist Party and other organizations actually challenged capitalism itself -- called it exploitive and critiqued it. You had Edward Bellamy and his "Looking Backward" -- a utopian socialist society is depicted in this novel, and in this society they have fixed the social and economic injustices of the time. In fact, the Socialist Party is going to run candidates for political offices at both the state and national level. And eventually -- and this is in period 7 -- the effort to reform these problems will eventually lead to a movement known as the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. And we got some videos on that as well -- check them out.

Finally, not only are there going to be people addressing the economic problems of the Gilded Age, you're going to have people addressing the social ones as well. The National American Woman Suffrage Association -- NAWSA -- sought to secure the right to vote for women -- the right of suffrage. You have people like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Carrie Chapman Catt working tirelessly throughout this time period trying to get the right to vote. Various African-American leaders sought to advance the cause of civil rights. Important one for period 6 is Booker T. Washington, and he advocated African-Americans should acquire vocational skills -- job skills -- to gain self-respect and economic security. He established the Tuskegee Institute to try to accomplish this goal. And Ida B. Wells was very active in not only the women's rights movement but also in the campaign against lynching.
