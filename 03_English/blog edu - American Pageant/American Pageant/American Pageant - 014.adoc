what’s craaackin' APUSH people? today we’re going to take a look at the Age of Reform 改革时代 from 1790 to 1860. + 
 if you’re reading any of these three APUSH books, we got you covered 'cuz we’re going to review all the good stuff in each one of those. + 
 so let’s take a look at the big ideas today:

the Second Great Awakening 第二次大觉醒，liberal social ideas from abroad, and romantic beliefs in human perfectibility 人类可完善性的浪漫信念 fostered 促进 the rise of voluntary organizations 志愿组织 to promote religious and secular reforms 宗教和世俗改革，including abolition 废除奴隶制 and women’s rights 妇女权利. + 
 we’re going to break that one down today. + 


various groups of American Indians, women, and religious followers developed cultures reflecting their interests and experiences, as did regional groups and an emerging urban middle class 新兴城市中产阶级. + 


what the heck does it all mean? that’s why you’re here. + 


one important point is there’s going to be this liberalism in religion 宗教自由主义. + 
 in fact, as a result of the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 (which was going on way before the American Revolution), there’s these new ideas such as deism 自然神论 - and this idea of deism is less revelation 启示，more reliance on reason 理性；less Bible 圣经，more science 科学. + 
 now these two people do believe in God, but they feel that human beings have the capacity for moral behavior 道德行为能力 - it doesn’t need to all come from religion. + 


and another kind of idea that’s kind of in some ways threatening traditional religious views of the world is Unitarianism 唯一神论. + 
 Unitarianism is a spin - off 派生事物 from the less extreme Puritanism 清教主义 of the past - this idea that humans in a Unitarian view have free will 自由意志 and the possibility of salvation by good works 因善行而得救的可能性 (whereas if you live a good life and you choose to do things right, you can be saved). + 
 this is different than traditional views where God is seen as the stern creator 严厉的创造者，but rather he’s a loving father - and it’s a contrast with the kind of hellfire doctrines 地狱之火教义 of Calvinism 加尔文主义. + 


so these ideas are really challenging traditional religious views in the late 1700s/early 1800s, and these individuals are rejecting predestination 预定论 and this idea of human wickedness 人性邪恶. + 


so what you see happening is around the 1790s, a Second Great Awakening occurring. + 
 if the first one was a response to the Enlightenment, the second one is a concern over a lack of religious zeal 宗教热情 amongst American citizens and these ideas that we just discussed. + 


and so what is it? well, beginning in the 1790s you start to have these waves of revivals 宗教复兴 spreading across the country - these frontier camp meetings 边疆露营集会 like you see in the picture right there, where these preachers would come such as Charles Finney (who is a revival preacher 复兴派传教士 who leads the revivals in the New York area in the 1830s). + 
 and this guy’s against slavery, he’s also against the drinking of alcohol, and he’s really one of the lead figures of the Second Great Awakening. + 


but there’s a lot - and during this period, numerous citizens are converted 皈依. + 
 in fact, they’re kind of referred to as born - again Christians 重生的基督徒，and attendance in church dramatically increases. + 
 you have new religious sects 教派 formed, and two of the big ones are the Methodists 卫理公会派教徒 and the Baptists 浸礼会教徒 - huge increase in their numbers. + 
 and these two particular groups stress personal conversion 个人皈依 (once again, not predestination) - you have this personal conversion and this gives you a democratic control of church affairs 教会事务的民主管理. + 
 there’s much more of a democratic nature amongst the Methodist or Baptist congregations 教会团体. + 


and a key aspect of this is this emotionalism in worship 崇拜中的情感主义. + 
 some other things about the Great Awakening you should keep in mind is there is this increase in evangelicalism 福音主义 - this very emotional form of worship - and this is going to inspire reform efforts during this age of reform: things like prison reform 监狱改革，temperance 戒酒，the women’s movement 妇女运动，anti - slavery (partly is going to be inspired by this Second Great Awakening). + 


another key part of the Second Great Awakening was the key role of women in religion - the majority of new church members are women. + 
 in fact, women are going to play an important role in the Second Great Awakening, but also in the household because their role was of bringing the family back into religious worship. + 
 in fact, many women inspired by their involvement in the Second Great Awakening are going to be involved in other reform efforts. + 


one particular group you should be aware of are the Mormons 摩门教徒，and their founder is a guy by the name of Joseph Smith. + 
 he creates the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints (more commonly referred to as the Mormons). + 
 he gets this book of revelations 启示录，and he ends up traveling the country, eventually ending up in Illinois. + 
 as a result of views, an angry mob 暴民 kills him in 1844, and Joseph Smith is replaced by a new leader of the Mormon people - Brigham Young - and he ends up leading the Mormon followers to the area what is today Utah in 1846 - 1847 on this great Mormon Trek 摩门教大迁徙. + 


and what happens is they develop this separate community (New Zion 新锡安) where they’re going to be very prosperous on the frontier. + 
 they are cooperative - everyone’s working together with the same mission, and the settlement is going to grow over time by the birth rate, but also lots of Mormons are going to come from abroad because Mormon missionaries 摩门教传教士 are going to be spreading across the globe looking for new members. + 


an important thing to keep in mind with regard to the Mormons is the admission of Utah as a state will be delayed until 1896 because one of the things practiced by the Mormon community was polygamy 一夫多妻制 (having multiple wives), which was a controversial thing for the US government. + 


this period - an important concept to keep in mind is this Age of Reform, partly inspired by religious motives 宗教动机 but also sometimes secular (having nothing to do with religion 世俗的). + 


one interesting person you should be aware of is Dorothea Dix. + 
 she is going to work just tirelessly 不知疲倦地 to reform mental health treatment 心理健康治疗. + 
 when she was investigating this issue, she saw that many people were put in prison with mental health issues with criminals, and the treatment of the mentally ill 精神病患者 was abysmal 糟糕的. + 
 she travels the country, and her efforts leads to the growth of professional treatment for the mentally ill. + 


other reforms is education reform 教育改革. + 
 tax - supported schools 公立学校 were rare in the early years of the Republic - education/schooling was the privilege of the elite 精英阶层的特权 if anybody had access to it, and so education was really bad. + 
 and there’s some benefits that people begin to think about for public education of the population:

one is you want to instill Republican values 灌输共和主义价值观 - you want people to be good citizens and be knowledgeable

you also want to instill values such as discipline 纪律 and hard work 努力工作

you want people to have basic reading skills so that they can work in the factories and be able to operate the machinery 操作机器

and of course with all these immigrants coming over, some people who advocated public education wanted to Americanize these immigrants (these Irish and these German immigrants that are coming to America during this time)

key figure in this movement is Horace Mann. + 
 he becomes the secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education 马萨诸塞州教育委员会秘书. + 
 he starts putting all sorts of reforms forward such as: - longer school terms 更长的学期 - compulsory attendance 义务教育 (you have to go to school) - expanded curriculum 扩充的课程 - and of course more schools (sorry kids)

Horace Mann is partly to blame. + 
 this is going to be a northern reform movement more than any others - the South isn’t too keen on adopting these education reforms. + 
 there’s not a real need in a plantation - based economy 种植园经济. + 
 of course also keep in mind that this public schooling is going to be largely in the North - in fact in the South it was illegal to teach slaves to read or write (the famous story of Douglass learning to read and write with his master’s disapproval). + 


another reform movement you should be aware of is the temperance movement 戒酒运动. + 
 there were huge drinking problems in the country - drinking excessively 过度饮酒 was all too common. + 
 it was lonely on the frontier out on the farm, and people drank excessively. + 
 and there’s a lot of different motives as to why you want people to drink less:

the factory system (especially in the North) - you need an efficient, controlled labor source; you don’t want people drunk moving slow because they’re hung over 宿醉

family life is always a concern - you don’t want drunk husbands beating their wives and children

and for some, once again this issue of immigration - many saw the Irish and the German immigrants coming from cultures where drinking was way too common, and some Americans wanted to slow this down

well, the American Temperance Society 美国戒酒协会 is created in 1826. + 
 at first they kind of urged their members to take a drinking (or a non - drinking) pledge 誓言 to abstain from drinking 戒酒. + 
 here you have a man pledging to his family that he will stop drinking. + 
 over time, the American Temperance Society (very religious - a lot of evangelical Christians join it, but also secular people) are going to move from creating propaganda 宣传 to spread their dry message 禁酒信息 to actually trying to get people to stop drinking legally. + 
 so there’s a move from temperance ("hey stop drinking") to actually trying to get laws passed. + 
 and you’re going to see a law passed in Maine in 1851 which prohibits the manufacture and sale of liquor 酒类. + 
 and of course the big one will be nationwide when the 18th Amendment 第十八条修正案 is adopted right at the start of the 1920s banning liquor in America. + 
 more on that another time. + 


the women’s movement 妇女运动 is going to develop during this time. + 
 women are going to resist their substandard position in society 社会中低于标准的地位. + 
 women were treated like second - class citizens 二等公民. + 
 you know, this period - this age of the Common Man 普通人时代，democratization 民主化 where the property requirements were going away - did not apply to women. + 
 this really truly did mean the age of the Common Man. + 
 women were excluded - no right to vote; they forfeited their property to their husbands, and so on. + 


and what you get is this belief in the cult of domesticity 家庭崇拜 - this idea that the home was a special place for women where they would take care of their family, and that is kind of their realm 领域. + 
 there was this idea of Republican Motherhood 共和母亲身份 where mothers would raise their children to be good citizens, but that was very limiting for many women. + 


and as a result, you do get some women starting to resist. + 
 women reformers - they’re partly inspired by the Second Great Awakening - they’re taking a more public role within the church, but others are going to demand rights for women. + 
 some women are going to be very involved in the temperance movement (the anti - drinking movement), and some women are going to be very involved in the abolitionist movement 废奴运动 against slavery. + 


two important women you should know about: Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. + 
 both are going to be advocating for the right of women to vote (suffrage 选举权). + 
 and in fact in 1848, the Seneca Falls Convention 塞尼卡福尔斯会议 takes place in New York - women meet; it is the first national meeting amongst women. + 
 Stanton reads the Declaration of Sentiments 情感宣言 (very closely modeled after the Declaration of Independence) - it says "all men and women are created equal. + 
" in fact, not only do they have a list of resolutions 决议，they demand the right to vote for women, and it is seen as the beginning of the modern women’s rights movement. + 


however, over time the women’s rights movement in the 19th century antebellum America 美国内战前时期 is going to be overshadowed by the abolitionist movement, and women will have to wait for the right to vote until the 19th Amendment happens. + 


another important group: the Transcendentalists 超验主义者. + 
 transcendentalism - this idea that truth transcends the senses 真理超越感官 - it’s not just found by observation alone. + 
 every person possesses an inner light 内在之光 that can illuminate the highest truth 最高真理，and you get these thinkers and these writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson who stress self - reliance 自力更生，self - improvement 自我提升，and freedom. + 
 in fact, Emerson in 1837 is going to deliver "The American Scholar" speech at Harvard University where he’s going to challenge Americans to make their own art and culture ("don’t just copy Europe"). + 


the guy you see with the really kind of crazy eyes is Henry David Thoreau. + 
 he is going to be another transcendentalist. + 
 he’s going to write "On the Duty of Civil Disobedience" 论公民的不服从义务 where he refuses to pay his taxes during the Mexican - American War 美墨战争 because he feels it is an unjust war, and his ideas are going to inspire people such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King later on in the 20th century. + 


another kind of transcendentalist book is the book "Walden" 《瓦尔登湖》where Thoreau lives out in nature for two years, kind of discovering his inner self. + 


and with this you’re going to see the rise of utopian communities 乌托邦社区 during this time period - various movements to move away from conventional society 传统社会 and create a utopian community. + 
 the Mormons are an example of a religious communal effort 宗教团体努力 - they moved away from traditional society partly because traditional society was so hostile to them. + 


you get Brook Farm 布鲁克农场，which was a communal transcendentalist experiment in Massachusetts - it was secular (non - religious), it was humanistic 人文主义的 (the transcendentalist society of Brook Farm). + 


and then you get another one like New Harmony 新和谐公社 where they create a socialist - type community that would be the answer to the problems presented by industrialization - this kind of inequality 不平等 that the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 was creating. + 
 New Harmony was meant to address that. + 
 many of these utopian communities would fail, but many spring up across the country. + 


all right, that’s going to do it for today. + 
 thanks for watching - make sure if you haven’t already done so that you subscribe to Joe’s Productions, click like on the video, tell your friends, and as always, peace. +

好的，各位APUSH的同学们！今天我们要探讨1790年至1860年的改革时代。如果你正在阅读这三本APUSH教材中的任何一本，我们都能帮到你，因为我们将回顾每本书中的所有重要内容。让我们来看看今天的核心思想：

第二次大觉醒、来自国外的自由主义社会思想以及对人类完美性的浪漫主义信念，促进了旨在推动宗教和世俗改革（包括废奴运动和女权运动）的志愿组织的兴起。我们今天将详细分析这一点。
各种美洲印第安人、妇女和宗教追随者群体发展了反映其利益和经验的文化，地区群体和新兴的城市中产阶级也是如此。
这一切到底意味着什么？这就是你来这里的原因。

一个重要的点是，宗教领域将出现自由主义。事实上，由于启蒙运动（远在美国革命之前就已发生），出现了一些新的思想，例如自然神论——这种自然神论的思想更侧重于理性而非启示；更侧重于科学而非《圣经》。现在，这两个人都相信上帝，但他们认为人类有能力进行道德行为——这并不完全需要来自宗教。

另一种在某种程度上威胁着传统宗教世界观的思想是一神论。一神论是从过去不那么极端的清教主义中分离出来的——这种思想认为，在一神论的观点中，人类拥有自由意志，并且可以通过善行获得救赎（也就是说，如果你过着美好的生活并选择做正确的事情，你就可以得救）。这与传统的观点不同，在传统观点中，上帝被视为严厉的创造者，而在这里他是一位慈爱的父亲——这与加尔文主义的地狱之火教义形成了对比。

因此，这些思想在1700年代末/1800年代初真正挑战着传统的宗教观点，这些人拒绝预定论和人类邪恶的思想。

因此，你看到大约在1790年代，第二次大觉醒发生了。如果第一次大觉醒是对启蒙运动的回应，那么第二次大觉醒是对美国公民宗教热忱不足以及我们刚才讨论的这些思想的担忧。

那么它是什么呢？好吧，从1790年代开始，你开始看到复兴运动的浪潮席卷全国——就像你右边图片中看到的那种边疆营地会议，像查尔斯·芬尼这样的传道者会来到这里（他是一位复兴布道者，在1830年代领导了纽约地区的复兴运动）。这个人反对奴隶制，他也反对饮酒，他确实是第二次大觉醒的主要人物之一。

但有很多——在此期间，无数公民皈依。事实上，他们被某种程度上称为重生的基督徒，教堂的出席率急剧增加。新的宗教教派形成，其中两个主要的教派是卫理公会和浸礼会——他们的数量急剧增加。这两个特定的群体强调个人皈依（再次强调，不是预定论）——你拥有这种个人皈依，这赋予你对教会事务的民主控制。卫理公会或浸礼会的会众中存在更多的民主性质。

而一个关键方面是敬拜中的这种情感主义。关于大觉醒，你应该记住的其他一些事情是，福音派主义的兴起——这种非常情绪化的敬拜形式——这将激励改革时代期间的改革努力：比如监狱改革、禁酒运动、妇女运动、反奴隶制运动（部分将受到第二次大觉醒的启发）。

第二次大觉醒的另一个关键部分是妇女在宗教中的关键作用——大多数新加入教会的成员都是妇女。事实上，妇女将在第二次大觉醒中发挥重要作用，同时也在家庭中发挥重要作用，因为她们的角色是将家庭带回宗教崇拜。事实上，许多受到她们参与第二次大觉醒的启发，妇女将参与其他改革努力。

你应该了解的一个特定群体是摩门教徒，他们的创始人名叫约瑟夫·史密斯。他创建了耶稣基督后期圣徒教会（更常被称为摩门教）。他得到了这本启示之书，最终在美国各地旅行，最终到达伊利诺伊州。由于其观点，一群愤怒的暴徒在1844年杀死了他，约瑟夫·史密斯被摩门教人民的新领袖——布里格姆·杨——取代，他最终在1846-1847年的伟大摩门教徒西迁中带领摩门教信徒前往今天的犹他州地区。

结果是，他们建立了这个独立的社区（新锡安），在那里他们将在边疆地区非常繁荣。他们是合作的——每个人都为了同一个目标共同努力，而这个定居点将随着时间的推移通过出生率增长，而且许多摩门教徒将从国外前来，因为摩门教传教士将在全球各地寻找新成员。

关于摩门教徒，需要记住的一个重要的事情是，犹他州作为州加入联邦的进程将被推迟到1896年，因为摩门教社区 практикует 多配偶制（拥有多个妻子），这对于美国政府来说是一个有争议的事情。

这一时期——一个需要记住的重要概念是改革时代，部分受到宗教动机的启发，但也有些是世俗的（与宗教无关）。

你应该了解的一位有趣的人物是多萝西娅·迪克斯。她将不知疲倦地致力于改革精神疾病的治疗。当她调查这个问题时，她发现许多患有精神疾病的人与罪犯一起被关进监狱，而精神病患者的待遇非常糟糕。她走遍全国，她的努力促成了对精神病患者的专业治疗的发展。

其他改革是教育改革。在共和国早期，由税收支持的学校很少——教育/学校是少数精英的特权，因此教育非常糟糕。人们开始思考普及民众公共教育的一些好处：

一是你想灌输共和价值观——你想让人们成为好公民并具有知识
你还想灌输纪律和努力工作的价值观
你希望人们拥有基本的阅读能力，以便他们可以在工厂工作并操作机器
当然，随着所有这些移民的到来，一些倡导公共教育的人希望使这些移民（当时来到美国的爱尔兰和德国移民）美国化
这场运动的关键人物是霍勒斯·曼。他成为马萨诸塞州教育委员会的秘书。他开始提出各种改革，例如：——延长学期——强制出勤（你必须上学）——扩大课程——当然还有更多的学校（对不起孩子们）

霍勒斯·曼对此负有部分责任。这将主要是一场北方改革运动——南方对采纳这些教育改革不太热衷。在以种植园为基础的经济中，没有真正的需求。当然，也要记住，这种公共教育主要将在北方进行——事实上，在南方，教奴隶读写是非法的（道格拉斯在主人不赞成的情况下学习读写的著名故事）。

你应该了解的另一个改革运动是禁酒运动。当时国家存在严重的酗酒问题——过度饮酒非常普遍。在边疆农场的生活很孤独，人们过度饮酒。关于为什么要让人们少喝酒，有很多不同的动机：

工厂制度（尤其是在北方）——你需要一个高效、受控的劳动力；你不想让人们因为宿醉而行动迟缓
家庭生活始终是一个令人担忧的问题——你不想让醉酒的丈夫殴打他们的妻子和孩子
对于一些人来说，再次是移民问题——许多人看到爱尔兰和德国移民来自饮酒非常普遍的文化，一些美国人想减缓这种趋势
美国禁酒协会于1826年成立。起初，他们某种程度上敦促其成员做出饮酒（或不饮酒）的承诺，以戒酒。你在这里看到一个男人向他的家人承诺他将停止饮酒。随着时间的推移，美国禁酒协会（非常虔诚——许多福音派基督徒加入其中，但也有世俗人士）将从制作宣传品传播他们的禁酒信息，转向真正试图通过法律手段让人们停止饮酒。因此，存在从节制（“嘿，别喝酒了”）到实际试图通过法律的转变。你将在1851年看到缅因州通过了一项禁止制造和销售酒类的法律。当然，更大的范围将在20世纪20年代初通过第18修正案在全国范围内禁止酒类。更多内容以后再谈。

妇女运动将在这一时期发展起来。妇女将反抗她们在社会中低下的地位。妇女被视为二等公民。你知道，这个时期——平民时代，财产要求被取消的民主化——并不适用于妇女。这确实真正意味着平民时代。妇女被排除在外——没有投票权；她们的财产被丈夫没收等等。

你所看到的是对“家庭崇拜”的信仰——这种认为家庭是妇女的特殊场所，她们在那里照顾家人，那是她们的领域。存在“共和母亲”的观念，即母亲将抚养孩子成为好公民，但这对许多妇女来说非常有限。

结果，你确实看到一些妇女开始反抗。妇女改革者——她们部分受到第二次大觉醒的启发——她们在教会中扮演着更公开的角色，但其他人将要求妇女的权利。一些妇女将非常积极地参与禁酒运动（反饮酒运动），一些妇女将非常积极地参与反对奴隶制的废奴运动。

你应该了解两位重要的女性：卢克丽霞·莫特和伊丽莎白·卡迪·斯坦顿。两人都将倡导妇女的投票权（选举权）。事实上，在1848年，纽约州的塞内卡瀑布会议召开——妇女们聚集在一起；这是妇女的第一次全国性会议。斯坦顿宣读了《情感宣言》（非常紧密地模仿了《独立宣言》）——它说“所有男人和女人都被造而平等”。事实上，她们不仅有一份决议清单，她们还要求妇女的投票权，这被视为现代女权运动的开端。

然而，随着时间的推移，19世纪内战前美国的女权运动将被废奴运动所掩盖，妇女将不得不等到第19修正案通过后才能获得投票权。

另一个重要的群体：超验主义者。超验主义——这种认为真理超越感官的思想——它不仅仅通过观察就能找到。每个人都拥有一种内在的光芒，可以照亮最高的真理，你看到了像拉尔夫·瓦尔多·爱默生这样的思想家和作家，他们强调自力更生、自我完善和自由。事实上，爱默生在1837年在哈佛大学发表了《美国学者》的演讲，他在演讲中挑战美国人创造自己的艺术和文化（“不要仅仅模仿欧洲”）。

你看到的那个眼神有点疯狂的人是亨利·大卫·梭罗。他将是另一位超验主义者。他将写下《论公民不服从的义务》，他在美墨战争期间拒绝纳税，因为他认为那是一场不义的战争，他的思想将在20世纪启发像甘地和马丁·路德·金这样的人。

另一本超验主义书籍是《瓦尔登湖》，梭罗在那里在自然中生活了两年，某种程度上发现了他的内在自我。

随之而来的是，你将在这一时期看到乌托邦社区的兴起——各种脱离传统社会并创建乌托邦社区的运动。摩门教徒是宗教公社努力的一个例子——他们脱离传统社会部分是因为传统社会对他们非常敌视。

你看到了布鲁克农场，这是马萨诸塞州的一个公社超验主义实验——它是世俗的（非宗教的），它是人文主义的（布鲁克农场的超验主义社会）。

然后你看到了另一个像新和谐公社这样的，他们创建了一个社会主义类型的社区，这将是解决工业化带来的问题的答案——工业革命正在造成的这种不平等。新和谐公社旨在解决这个问题。许多这样的乌托邦社区都会失败，但全国各地涌现出许多这样的社区。

好的，今天就到这里。感谢观看——如果你还没有这样做，请务必订阅乔氏出品，点赞这个视频，告诉你的朋友们，一如既往，再见。

what's craaackin' APUSH people? today
we're going to take a look at the Age of
Reform from 1790 to
1860. if you're reading any of these
three APUSH books, we got you covered 'cuz
we're going to review all the good stuff
in each one of those. so let's take a
look at the big ideas today:

1. the Second Great Awakening, liberal social
ideas from abroad, and romantic beliefs
in human perfectibility fostered the
rise of voluntary organizations to
promote religious and secular reforms,
including abolition and women's rights.
we're going to break that one down today.

2. various groups of American
Indians, women, and religious followers
developed cultures reflecting their
interests and experiences, as did regional
groups and an emerging urban middle
class.

what the heck does it all mean?
that's why you're here.

one important
point is there's going to be this
liberalism in religion. in fact, as a
result of the Enlightenment (which was
going on way before the American
Revolution), there's these new ideas such
as deism - and this idea of deism is less
revelation, more reliance on reason; less
Bible, more science. now these two people
do believe in God, but they feel that
human beings have the capacity for moral
behavior - it doesn't need to all come
from religion.

and another kind of idea
that's kind of in some ways threatening
traditional religious views of the world
is Unitarianism. Unitarianism is a
spin-off from the less extreme
Puritanism of the past - this idea that
humans in a Unitarian view have free
will and the possibility of salvation by
good works (whereas if you live a good
life and you choose to do things right,
you can be saved). this is different than
traditional views where God is seen as
the stern creator, but rather he's a
loving father - and it's a contrast with
the kind of hellfire doctrines of Calvinism.

so these ideas are really
challenging traditional religious views
in the late 1700s/early
1800s, and these individuals are
rejecting predestination and this idea
of human wickedness.

so what you see
happening is around the 1790s, a Second
Great Awakening occurring. if the
first one was a response to the
Enlightenment, the second one is a
concern over a lack of religious zeal
amongst American citizens and these ideas
that we just discussed.

and so what is it? well, beginning in the
1790s you start to have these waves of
revivals spreading across the country -
these frontier camp meetings like you
see in the picture right there, where
these preachers would come such as
Charles Finney (who is a revival preacher
who leads the revivals in the New York
area in the 1830s). and this guy's against
slavery, he's also against the drinking
of alcohol, and he's really one of the
lead figures of the Second Great
Awakening.

but there's a lot - and during
this period, numerous citizens are
converted. in fact, they're kind of
referred to as born-again Christians, and
attendance in church dramatically
increases. you have new religious sects
formed, and two of the big ones are the
Methodists and the Baptists - huge increase
in their numbers. and these two
particular groups stress personal
conversion (once again, not predestination)
- you have this personal conversion
and this gives you a democratic control
of church affairs. there's much more of a
democratic nature amongst the Methodist
or Baptist congregations.

and a key
aspect of this is this emotionalism in
worship. some other things about the
Great Awakening you should keep in mind
is there is this increase in
evangelicalism - this very emotional form
of worship - and this is going to inspire
reform efforts during this age of reform:
things like prison reform, temperance, the
women's movement, anti-slavery (partly is
going to be inspired by this Second
Great Awakening).

another key part of the
Second Great Awakening was the key role
of women in religion - the majority of new
church members are women. in fact, women
are going to play an important role in
the Second Great Awakening, but also in
the household because their role was of
bringing the family back into
religious worship.
in fact, many women inspired by their
involvement in the Second Great
Awakening are going to be involved in
other reform
efforts.

one particular group you should
be aware of are the Mormons, and their
founder is a guy by the name of Joseph
Smith. he creates the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints (more commonly
referred to as the Mormons). he gets this
book of revelations, and he ends up
traveling the country, eventually ending
up in Illinois. as a result of views,
an angry mob kills him in 1844, and
Joseph Smith is replaced by a new leader
of the Mormon people - Brigham Young - and
he ends up leading the Mormon
followers to the area what is today Utah
in 1846-1847 on this great Mormon Trek.

and what happens is they develop this
separate community (New Zion) where
they're going to be very prosperous
on the frontier. they are cooperative -
everyone's working together with the
same mission, and the settlement is going
to grow over time by the birth rate, but
also lots of Mormons are going to come
from abroad because Mormon missionaries
are going to be spreading across the
globe looking for new members.

an
important thing to keep in mind with
regard to the Mormons is the admission
of Utah as a state will be delayed until
1896 because one of the things practiced
by the Mormon community was polygamy
(having multiple wives), which was a
controversial thing for the US
government.

this period - an important
concept to keep in mind is this Age of
Reform, partly inspired by religious
motives but also sometimes secular
(having nothing to do with
religion).

one interesting person you
should be aware of is Dorothea Dix. she is
going to work just tirelessly to reform
mental health treatment. when she was
investigating this issue, she saw that
many people were put in prison with
mental health issues with criminals, and
the treatment of the mentally ill was
abysmal. she travels the country, and her
efforts leads to the growth of
professional treatment for the mentally
ill.

other reforms is education reform.
tax-supported schools were rare in the
early years of the Republic - education/
schooling was the privilege of the elite
if anybody had access to it, and so
education was really bad. and there's
some benefits that people begin to think
about for public education of the
population:

- one is you want to instill
Republican values - you want people to be
good citizens and be knowledgeable
- you also want to instill values such as discipline and hard work
- you want people to have basic reading
skills so that they can work in the
factories and be able to operate the
machinery
- and of course with all these
immigrants coming over, some people who
advocated public education wanted to Americanize these immigrants
(these Irish and these German immigrants
that are coming to America during this
time)

key figure in this movement is
Horace Mann. he becomes the secretary of
the Massachusetts Board of Education. he
starts putting all sorts of reforms
forward such as:
- longer school terms
- compulsory attendance (you have to go
to school)
- expanded curriculum
- and of course more schools (sorry kids)

Horace Mann is partly to blame. this is going to be
a northern reform movement more than any
others - the South isn't too keen on
adopting these education reforms.
there's not a real need in a
plantation-based economy. of course also
keep in mind that this public schooling
is going to be largely in the North - in
fact in the South it was illegal to
teach slaves to read or write (the famous
story of Douglass learning to read and
write with his master's
disapproval).

another reform movement you
should be aware of is the temperance movement.
there were huge drinking problems in the
country - drinking excessively was all too
common. it was lonely on the
frontier out on the farm, and people
drank excessively. and there's a lot of
different motives as to why you want
people to drink less:

1. the factory
system (especially in the North) - you need
an efficient, controlled labor source; you
don't want people drunk moving slow
because they're hung over
2. family life is always a concern - you don't want drunk
husbands beating their wives and
children
3. and for some, once again this
issue of immigration - many saw the Irish
and the German immigrants coming from
cultures where drinking was way too
common, and some Americans wanted to slow
this down

well, the American Temperance
Society is created in
1826. at first they kind of urged their
members to take a drinking (or a
non-drinking) pledge to abstain from
drinking. here you have a man pledging to
his family that he will stop drinking.
over time, the American Temperance
Society (very religious - a lot of
evangelical Christians join it, but also
secular people) are going to move from creating propaganda to spread their
dry message to actually trying to get
people to stop drinking legally. so
there's a move from temperance ("hey stop
drinking") to actually trying to get laws
passed. and you're going to see a law
passed in Maine in
1851 which prohibits the manufacture and
sale of liquor. and of course the big one
will be nationwide when the 18th
Amendment is adopted right at the start
of the 1920s banning liquor in America.
more on that another time.

the women's
movement is going to develop during this
time. women are going to resist their substandard position in society. women
were treated like second-class citizens.
you know, this period - this age of the
Common Man, democratization where the
property requirements were going away -
did not apply to women. this really truly
did mean the age of the Common Man. women
were excluded - no right to vote; they
forfeited their property to their
husbands, and so on.

and what you get is
this belief in the cult of domesticity - this idea that the home was a
special place for women where they
would take care of their family, and that
is kind of their realm. there was this
idea of Republican Motherhood where
mothers would raise their children to be
good citizens, but that was very
limiting for many women.

and as a result,
you do get some women starting to resist.
women reformers - they're partly inspired
by the Second Great Awakening - they're
taking a more public role within the
church, but others are going to demand
rights for women. some women are
going to be very involved in the
temperance movement (the anti-drinking
movement), and some women are going to be
very involved in the abolitionist
movement against slavery.

two important
women you should know about: Lucretia Mott and
Elizabeth Cady Stanton. both are going to
be advocating for the right of women to
vote (suffrage). and in fact in 1848, the
Seneca Falls Convention takes place in
New York - women meet; it is the first
national meeting amongst women. Stanton
reads the Declaration of Sentiments (very
closely modeled after the Declaration of
Independence) - it says "all men and women
are created equal." in fact, not only do
they have a list of resolutions, they
demand the right to vote for women, and
it is seen as the beginning of the
modern women's rights movement.

however,
over time the women's rights movement in the 19th century antebellum America
is going to be overshadowed by the
abolitionist movement, and women will
have to wait for the right to vote until
the 19th Amendment
happens.

another important group: the
Transcendentalists. transcendentalism - this
idea that truth transcends the senses -
it's not just found by observation alone.
every person possesses an inner light
that can illuminate the highest truth,
and you get these thinkers and these
writers such as Ralph Waldo
Emerson who stress self-reliance,
self-improvement, and freedom. in fact,
Emerson in 1837 is going to deliver "The
American Scholar" speech at Harvard
University where he's going to challenge
Americans to make their own art and
culture ("don't just copy Europe").

the guy
you see with the really kind of crazy
eyes is Henry David Thoreau. he is going to
be another transcendentalist. he's going
to write "On the Duty of Civil
Disobedience" where he refuses to pay
his taxes during the Mexican-American War
because he feels it is an unjust war, and
his ideas are going to inspire people such as Gandhi
and Martin Luther King later on in the
20th century.

another kind of
transcendentalist book is the book
"Walden" where Thoreau lives out in
nature for two years, kind of discovering
his inner
self.

and with this you're going to see
the rise of utopian communities
during this time period - various
movements to move away from conventional
society and create a utopian community.
the Mormons are an example of a
religious communal effort - they moved
away from traditional society partly
because traditional society was so
hostile to them.

you get Brook Farm, which
was a communal transcendentalist
experiment in Massachusetts - it was
secular (non-religious), it was humanistic
(the transcendentalist society of
Brook Farm).

and then you get another one
like New Harmony where they create a
socialist-type community that would be
the answer to the problems presented by
industrialization - this kind of
inequality that the Industrial
Revolution was creating. New Harmony was
meant to address that. many of these
utopian communities would fail, but many
spring up across the country.

all right, that's going to do it for today.
