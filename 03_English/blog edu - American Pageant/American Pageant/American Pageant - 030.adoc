Welcome back, APUSH crew 美国历史课程学习伙伴. Today we're taking a look at the Roaring 20s 咆哮的二十年代. If you're studying the periods 1919 to around 1929 in your APUSH class or using any of these textbooks, this video is going to help you get a five on that APUSH exam 在美国历史课程考试中得五分.
An important thing to keep in mind is even before the Roaring 20s, there was a fear following World War I 第一次世界大战. It actually begins during the war. If you recall in 1917, the Communist Party 共产党 came to power 掌权 in Russia -- this is the Bolshevik Revolution 布尔什维克革命 -- and many Americans were concerned that perhaps this was the start of a communist movement 共产主义运动 all over the globe 全球.
Strikes 罢工 actually occur also in 1919. This is a completely separate issue 完全独立的事件 even though some people blame these strikes on radical movements 激进运动. Most of them were about increasing workers' wages 提高工人工资，reducing hours 缩短工时 and improving safety conditions 改善安全条件. But you get strikes going down in many important industries 重要行业. You have this great steel strike 钢铁大罢工 in 1919, the Boston police strike 波士顿警察罢工 where police officers actually go on strike 举行罢工. And one of the important outcomes 重要结果 of these strikes is very often the National Guard 国民警卫队 was called out 被召集 to break up 驱散 these strikes, and public opinion 公众舆论 throughout the 1920s is going to be very anti-union 反工会的.
Race riots 种族骚乱 also occur following -- and in fact during -- the war. This was a result of American cities changing demographically 人口结构变化. There was a lot of resentment 怨恨 over competition for jobs between white and black residents 白人和黑人居民竞争工作 and over housing 住房问题. In fact some of the worst racial riots take place 发生 in 1919 in Chicago where over 40 people are killed during the riots 骚乱中 40 多人丧生.
And then you have bombs go off 爆炸 in 1919 - 1920 in eight American cities, and many people in the country think that this is the start of a radical movement 激进运动 -- a revolution going to take place in America. And this becomes known as the Red Scare 红色恐慌. And it's important to keep in mind that these events you see -- these four things -- are not necessarily connected 不一定有联系. But when all of them are happening around the same time -- you have the bombings 爆炸事件，you have this Red Scare developing 红色恐慌加剧 -- and the guy who's going to play a key role 发挥关键作用 during this is the Attorney General of the United States A. Mitchell Palmer 美国司法部长 A. 米切尔・帕尔默. And he's going to lead a series of raids 突袭行动 of suspected radicals 可疑的激进分子 in the United States, and thousands of people are going to be arrested during these Palmer Raids 帕尔默突袭行动 during the first Red Scare 第一次红色恐慌.
Another thing that kind of continues going into the 1920s is once again a rise of nativism 本土主义抬头. You know the Palmer Raids led to the mass arrest 大规模逮捕 of socialist 社会主义者，anarchist 无政府主义者，union organizers 工会组织者 or other suspected radicals. And very often these people -- these individuals -- were being arrested for their ideas 因思想观念被捕. And in many cases there was very little evidence if any 几乎没有证据，because these people were just guilty of believing in things that were unpopular during the decade 只因相信在那个年代不受欢迎的事物而获罪.
And with this Red Scare, there is going to be a continued hatred towards new immigrants 对新移民的持续仇恨 in the 1920s. In fact in 1921 the Quota Act 配额法案 will be passed -- signed into law 签署成为法律 by President Harding -- and it's going to limit immigration numbers 限制移民数量 to 3% of those living in the US as of 1910. Add another law to immigration policy called the National Origins Act of 1924 1924 年《国家 origins 法案》. This one sets the quota 设定配额 at 2% of the immigrants in the US, and they used the year 1890. And they used the numbers of the 1890 census 1890 年人口普查数据. And the reason why they switched that year to 1890 is they're trying to limit the new immigrants that were largely coming in from Southern and Eastern Europe 南欧和东欧. These immigrants were considered undesirable 不受欢迎的，and they want to cut off that immigration from those countries in particular 尤其要切断来自那些国家的移民. In 1890 is kind of a year where there were less of those immigrants than in years following 相比之后几年，1890 年来自那些地区的移民较少.
The National Origins Act of 1924 is also going to severely restrict Asian immigrants 严重限制亚洲移民. In fact no Japanese immigrants are allowed to come at all 完全禁止日本移民入境. But it's important to keep in mind during the 1920s you're going to have unrestricted immigration 不受限制的移民 from the Western Hemisphere 西半球. So lots of immigrants coming in especially from Mexico working in jobs in the Southwest predominantly in agriculture 主要在西南部从事农业工作.
And one of the most important cases and really symbolic of the anti-immigrant feeling 反移民情绪 of the 1920s is the case of Sacco and Vanzetti 萨科和万泽蒂案. And there they are -- Sacco and Vanzetti. And what happens is these two men are Italian immigrants 意大利移民 who are charged with 被指控 robbery and murder 抢劫和谋杀 in 1921 Boston. And they're found guilty 被判有罪 and sentenced to death 判处死刑. And this trial really demonstrates the tensions of the era 时代的紧张局势. Many people felt that Sacco and Vanzetti were not receiving justice 没有得到公正审判. And what occurs -- and the reasons why they say this -- is very often during the case it's the fact that they're Italian immigrants, they're radicals 激进分子，they're anarchists 无政府主义者 and they're World War I draft dodgers 第一次世界大战逃兵役者. Those become the issues in the case 这些成为案件的争议点. And ultimately both men will be executed 被处决 in 1927 in spite of the fact that there's a lot of people around the world calling for their release 尽管全世界很多人呼吁释放他们.
Another thing about the 1920s that occurs -- kind of connected to the issue of immigration and anti-radical feelings 反激进情绪 -- is the resurgence 复兴 of the KKK 三 K 党. If you recall the KKK is created following the Civil War 美国内战后 during Reconstruction 重建时期. And in the 20s the Klan broadens its influence 扩大影响力 throughout the decade. They expand their influence not just in the South but also in the Midwest 中西部 and in other regions of the country. And their hatred isn't confined to African-American people exclusively any longer 不再仅仅针对非裔美国人. They are going to speak out 公开反对 and be against not only African-Americans but immigrants -- especially those Southern and Eastern European immigrants -- Catholics 天主教徒，radicals, and any other people that were not white Anglo-Saxon Protestant 非白人盎格鲁 - 撒克逊新教徒.
In fact just before the 1920s, a popular film -- a very pro-KKK film -- The Birth of a Nation 《一个国家的诞生》 is extremely popular in the United States. And in the film it is the Klan that are the heroes of Reconstruction 三 K 党是重建时期的英雄. They're going to organize themselves throughout the decade 整个十年进行组织活动. They're going to become very powerful -- to 5 million members by 1925. And what they are saying to the American people is that they are a patriotic organization 爱国组织. They support -- largely and they're going to get support largely from white Protestants especially in the small towns and cities 主要得到小城镇白人新教徒的支持. And the Klan itself will exert tremendous political influence 施加巨大政治影响力. Here you see them marching in Washington DC 他们在华盛顿特区游行.
So far this decade's been kind of a downer 令人沮丧，but kind of why is it called The Roaring 20s? Well one of the things that happens is you have the rise -- the development -- of the mass consumption economy 大众消费经济. In 1920 it is the first time a majority of Americans live in urban areas 城市地区. You could see that on the chart right there -- 51%. And the economic prosperity 经济繁荣 -- as a whole the economy is going to roar 蓬勃发展. There's a tremendous growth in the stock market 股票市场. And very often this growth was built on people buying on margin 保证金购买. They're taking out loans 贷款 to buy stock 股票. And we're going to see how that turns out in the next video. And the reason they're doing this is they're investing based on speculation 投机. They feel this market is going to continue to go up 上涨. And for much of the decade it will go up until the great crash 大崩盘 in 1929.
The mass consumption economy is really going to be dependent upon 依赖 a large number of new and affordable consumer goods 消费品 becoming available. Things like the vacuum cleaner 吸尘器，the washing machine 洗衣机 and other goods are going to be purchased by people. And really electricity in homes 家庭用电 leads to this increased demand for consumer appliances 家用电器. Once people are moving to cities and electricity is available in more and more homes, you can now have these new consumer goods. And these are going to save time in doing things like housework 家务.
Feeding this consumerism 消费主义 was buying goods on credit 赊购商品. The installment plan 分期付款计划 is really kind of introduced on a wide scale 大规模推行 in the 20s. And the idea is you can possess today and pay tomorrow 今天拥有，明天付款. So of course now lots of people are able to buy things that they normally could not 通常买不起的东西. The downside 弊端 of this of course is debt 债务. And we're going to see once again the consequences of this debt in our next video.
And advertising 广告 is going to play a key role 发挥关键作用 in the 1920s. You see one of the popular ads in the 20s right there -- "Bad breath? Halitosis 口臭 makes you unpopular. So brush your teeth." Children's advertising industry 儿童广告业 is going to manipulate consumer demand 操纵消费需求 by increasing people's desire to have various products 增加人们对各种产品的需求.
Another area that's going to really transform itself 彻底变革 in the 1920s is transportation 交通. Frederick Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management 弗雷德里克・泰勒的科学管理原理 -- and his whole idea was that workers can improve their productivity 提高生产效率，that management can improve the productivity of workers by having them eliminate certain motions 消除某些动作 in the production process 生产过程. And the guy who really kind of adopts many of these ideas 采纳这些理念 is Henry Ford 亨利・福特. Cars become affordable for the average American 普通美国人买得起汽车 -- the famous Model T 著名的 T 型车 you could see there. And really the assembly line 流水线 introduced by Henry Ford allows for this mass production 大规模生产 to take place in the automobile industry 汽车行业.
Now while the railroad industry 铁路行业 is going to be hurt by cars, there is going to be a huge boom 巨大繁荣 in other industries such as steel 钢铁 and rubber 橡胶 and gasoline 汽油，highway construction 公路建设 and a whole host of others 许多其他行业 because of the rise of the automobile 汽车的兴起. And not just economic impacts 经济影响 of the car, but also the car becomes a badge of freedom and equality 自由和平等的象征. And it's going to have social consequences 社会影响 as well.
The airplane 飞机 plays a key role. In fact one of the key kind of figures 关键人物 in this story is Charles Lindbergh 查尔斯・林德伯格 who becomes the first person to fly solo 独自飞行 across the Atlantic 大西洋. He goes from New York to Paris in a very long journey of over 33 hours in a single engine plane 单引擎飞机 -- some scary stuff 惊险的事情. And when he comes back he becomes a national hero 民族英雄 -- instant celebrity 即刻成名 -- because people are able to follow his journey with the radio 收音机. And that leads us to the mass media 大众媒体 and the impact of mass media on the 20s.
It's really important to understand the impact of the radio 收音机的影响. In November of 1920 we have the first radio broadcast 无线电广播 out of Pittsburgh 匹兹堡. It announces the election of Warren G. Harding 沃伦・G・哈定 to the American public 美国民众. And really the radio is going to play a key role in tying the nation together 团结全国. It provides shared experiences 共同体验. People are listening to the same advertisements, the same speeches, the same forms of entertainment 娱乐形式 on a national scale 全国范围.
You also see in the 1920s the rise of the movie industry 电影产业 and especially in Hollywood 好莱坞 -- out in Los Angeles 洛杉矶. There is the famous Hollywood sign 好莱坞标志 as it looked back in the day 当年的样子. Innovations in the movie industry itself 电影产业创新 -- you have The Jazz Singer 爵士歌手 in 1927 -- it becomes the first talkie 有声电影. And a part of this rise of mass media like radio and movies is the celebrity culture 名人文化 of the 1920s. You have people that become national celebrities 全国知名人物 -- people such as Babe Ruth 贝比・鲁斯 the famous New York Yankee 著名的纽约洋基队球员. And the radio and the movie once again fuels the consumption economy 消费经济 that characterizes the 1920s 是 20 年代的特征.
Gender 性别问题 in the 1920s is another important thing. This image of the decade was a decade of social customs 社会习俗 being challenged -- not just from women but for all different groups. And it was young women in cities that were really challenging the social customs of America -- jazz music 爵士乐，dancing, drinking bootleg liquor 私酿酒 and other challenges to traditional values 传统价值观.
Domestic labor saving devices 家庭省力设备 such as the vacuum cleaner, the washing machine are changing the roles of homemakers 家庭主妇角色 for some women. If you were a woman who was able to afford these new appliances 家电，you now had more free time 空闲时间. And the ultimate symbol 终极象征 of this kind of youthful rebellion 年轻一代的反叛 of young women was of course the flappers 摩登女郎.
You have some women who go much further with their challenging of existing social customs of the decade 挑战当时的社会习俗. And one of those women is Margaret Sanger 玛格丽特・桑格 who spoke openly -- in spite of protest 抗议 and in spite of her being arrested for obscenity laws 因淫秽法被捕 -- in the support of birth control 节育 and demanding that women should have the right to have access to birth control 有权获得节育措施.
These changes in the 1920s lead to a growth of fundamentalism 原教旨主义 and eventually you're going to see the Scopes Monkey Trial 斯科普斯猴子审判. So as the decade is seeing a battle between the values of the modernizing cities 现代化城市价值观 and the traditional values of rural areas 农村传统价值观，you're going to see the growth of a fundamentalist movement 原教旨主义运动. And fundamentalists 原教旨主义者 believe that every word in the Bible should be considered literally true 圣经中的每一句话都应被视为绝对真实. And the radio allows for preachers 传教士 such as Billy Sunday 比利・森迪 to reach a mass audience 广大听众. And he did so in the 20s when he spoke out against things like drinking and dancing, jazz music and gambling 赌博 and other things that some fundamentalists opposed 原教旨主义者反对的事物.
And the big moment happens when the ACLU -- the American Civil Liberties Union 美国公民自由联盟 -- sought to challenge a law in Tennessee -- the Butler Act 巴特勒法案 -- that outlawed the teaching of evolution 进化论 in public schools 公立学校. And they find a teacher John Scopes 约翰・斯科普斯 who will violate the law 违反法律. And in 1925 he is arrested for teaching evolution in a school in Dayton, Tennessee 田纳西州代顿市的一所学校. The entire world follows the trial by listening on the radio -- the famous Scopes Monkey Trial because it dealt with evolution 因为涉及进化论.
You have two of the best lawyers in the country. The prosecutor 检察官 is a religious fundamentalist 宗教原教旨主义者 -- also former presidential candidate 前总统候选人 William Jennings Bryan 威廉・詹宁斯・布赖恩. And the defense attorney 辩护律师 is Clarence Darrow 克拉伦斯・达罗 -- probably the most famous defense attorney in this time period 当时最著名的辩护律师. The trial goes on and Scopes is convicted 被判有罪. He gets off on a technicality 因技术细节而脱罪. And really the trial -- the Scopes trial -- demonstrated the tensions between the modern and the traditional religious values 现代与传统宗教价值观的紧张关系 of the 1920s.
Prohibition 禁酒令 is a key part of the 1920s. If you recall the 18th Amendment 第十八条修正案 was ratified 批准 in 1919 and it prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages 酒精饮料. And the Volstead Act 沃尔斯特德法案 is passed which was the federal law that would enforce the 18th Amendment 执行第十八条修正案. The issue of prohibition was very controversial 有争议的. There was fierce opposition 强烈反对 especially in large cities -- especially amongst immigrant communities 移民社区 -- to the banning of alcohol 禁酒.

Bootleg liquor 私酿酒 was served at speakeasies 地下酒吧；非法经营的酒吧 -- illegal clubs where alcohol was sold 售卖酒类的非法场所. People were making their own alcohol 自酿酒. And in many cases they were completely ignoring the law 完全无视法律. Part of the problem was there was understaffed law enforcement 执法人员配备不足. There wasn't enough police to police 巡查；监督 the borders of the United States to get all the different areas where alcohol was being distributed 分销 and made. And the other issue you can see in the political cartoon 政治漫画 was widespread corruption 普遍存在的腐败现象. Very often police, politicians and judges were paid off 受贿 to look the other way 视而不见.

And as a result of prohibition 禁酒令 you get the rise of organized crime 有组织犯罪的兴起. The big -- the big guy -- the famous guy is of course Al Capone 阿尔·卡彭 in Chicago 芝加哥. You have events like the St. Valentine's Day Massacre 情人节大屠杀 where violence increases 暴力事件升级. In spite of all this kind of controversy 争议, drinking does go down in the 1920s. But ultimately prohibition will be seen as a noble experiment 崇高的实验 that will fail 失败. And eventually it will be overturned 废除 with the 21st Amendment 第二十一条修正案 in the early 1930s. And the big problem is you can make something like alcohol illegal 非法的, but many people still want it. And so they're going to ignore the law 无视法律. Great photo -- people marching 游行 not for civil rights 民权, not for freedom 自由, but for beer 啤酒.

The decade of the 1920s for African-Americans was a mixed decade 喜忧参半的十年. Lynchings 私刑 continued to be a problem. The KKK 三K党 was becoming more and more popular. Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法, Plessy versus Ferguson 普莱西诉弗格森案 -- all of that stuff remained a fact of life 生活现实. And while those challenges are important, African-Americans continued to find ways to resist this injustice 反抗这种不公.

Recall 回想 there was a Great Migration 大迁徙 all the way before World War I where you have this mass movement 大规模迁徙 of African-Americans into Northern cities 北方城市. And you have the spread of jazz music 爵士乐的传播 out of New Orleans 新奥尔良 into cities such as New York and Chicago. Harlem 哈莱姆区 becomes kind of the unofficial cultural center 非官方文化中心 of Black America 美国黑人文化. And during the 20s you have a famous event known as the Harlem Renaissance 哈莱姆文艺复兴.

You have writers such as Claude McKay 克劳德·麦凯, Langston Hughes 兰斯顿·休斯, Zora Neale Hurston 佐拉·尼尔·赫斯顿. Famous jazz musicians like Louis Armstrong 路易斯·阿姆斯特朗. And really an important idea of the Harlem Renaissance is this idea of the New Negro 新黑人概念. In fact there was this emphasis on black pride 黑人自豪感, racial pride 种族自豪感 and celebrating the cultural traditions 文化传统 of that black community in much of the Harlem Renaissance's work 哈莱姆文艺复兴作品中.

And outside of the Harlem Renaissance you have a guy by the name of Marcus Garvey 马库斯·加维. He is an immigrant 移民 from Jamaica 牙买加 which was a British colony 英国殖民地. He comes to the United States and he creates the Universal Negro Improvement Association 世界黑人改进协会 -- the UNIA. He's going to call for African-Americans to go back to Africa 呼吁非裔美国人回到非洲. He believed in separatism 分离主义. He felt that African-Americans would not be able to get justice and equality 正义和平等 in America. But beyond that, Garvey's movement is going to promote black pride 黑人自豪感, black-owned business 黑人企业, self-confidence 自信, self-reliance 自力更生, self-sufficiency 自给自足 in the African-American community 非裔美国人社区. And he's going to play a key role 发挥关键作用 in mobilizing 动员 ordinary African-Americans who were perhaps not touched by the writings of the Harlem Renaissance. They're going to be touched by the words of Garvey 被加维的言论打动.

And finally make sure you know about the Lost Generation 迷惘的一代. This is a group of writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald 弗朗西斯·斯科特·菲茨杰拉德, Ernest Hemingway 欧内斯特·海明威, Sinclair Lewis 辛克莱·刘易斯. And their writing is going to criticize different aspects 方面 of the decade. They're going to question the reasons for fighting World War I, small town values 小镇价值观 in places like Dayton, Tennessee, fundamentalist religious views 原教旨主义宗教观点 and the materialism 物质主义 of the 1920s. So this group of artists are disillusioned with 对……感到失望 the old ideals 旧理想 of the past as well as the new materialistic culture 新物质文化.

That's going to close out 结束 the Roaring 20s 咆哮的二十年代. Make sure you subscribe to the channel 订阅频道, click like on the video 点赞视频, tell your friends and have a beautiful day. Peace 再见.

欢迎回来，APUSH的同学们。今天我们要探讨咆哮的二十年代。如果你正在学习APUSH课程中1919年至1929年左右的这段时期，或者使用这些教材中的任何一本，这个视频将帮助你在APUSH考试中拿到五分。

需要记住的一个重要的事情是，即使在咆哮的二十年代之前，第一次世界大战后就存在一种恐惧。它实际上在战争期间就开始了。如果你们还记得，1917年，共产党在俄国掌权——这就是布尔什维克革命——许多美国人担心这也许是全球共产主义运动的开始。

罢工实际上也发生在1919年。这是一个完全独立的问题，尽管有些人将这些罢工归咎于激进运动。大多数罢工是为了提高工人工资、缩短工时和改善安全条件。但在许多重要的行业都发生了罢工。1919年发生了伟大的钢铁罢工，波士顿警察罢工，警察实际上也举行了罢工。这些罢工的重要结果之一是，国民警卫队经常被调来镇压这些罢工，而整个1920年代的公众舆论将非常反工会。

战争结束后——事实上在战争期间——也发生了种族骚乱。这是美国城市人口结构变化的结果。白人和黑人居民之间因争夺工作和住房而产生了许多不满情绪。事实上，一些最严重的种族骚乱发生在1919年的芝加哥，骚乱中40多人丧生。

然后在1919年至1920年，八个美国城市发生了爆炸事件，美国国内许多人认为这是激进运动的开始——一场革命将在美国发生。这被称为“红色恐慌”。重要的是要记住，你们看到的这些事件——这四件事——不一定有关联。但是当所有这些事情几乎同时发生时——你们有爆炸事件，你们有这种红色恐慌的发展——而将在其中发挥关键作用的人是美国司法部长亚历山大·米切尔·帕尔默。他将领导一系列搜查美国境内可疑激进分子的行动，在第一次红色恐慌期间的帕尔默搜查中，数千人将被捕。

进入1920年代，另一种情况再次持续出现，那就是本土主义的再次抬头。你们知道，帕尔默搜查导致了社会主义者、无政府主义者、工会组织者或其他可疑激进分子的集体逮捕。而这些人——这些个体——往往因为他们的思想而被捕。在许多情况下，几乎没有任何证据，因为这些人仅仅是因为相信那个十年不受欢迎的东西而有罪。

随着这场红色恐慌，1920年代将继续存在对新移民的仇恨。事实上，1921年通过了《配额法案》——由哈丁总统签署成为法律——它将移民人数限制在1910年居住在美国人口的3%。另一项移民政策法案是1924年的《国家起源法案》。该法案将配额设定为美国移民人口的2%，并且他们使用了1890年的数据。他们使用了1890年人口普查的数据。他们将年份改为1890年的原因是，他们试图限制主要来自南欧和东欧的新移民。这些移民被认为不受欢迎，他们想特别阻止来自这些国家的移民。1890年是这些移民人数少于随后几年的年份。

1924年的《国家起源法案》还将严重限制亚洲移民。事实上，完全不允许日本移民入境。但重要的是要记住，在1920年代，来自西半球的移民将不受限制。因此，大量移民涌入，特别是来自墨西哥的移民，他们主要在西南部从事农业工作。

其中一个最重要的案件，也是1920年代反移民情绪的真正象征，是萨科和万泽蒂案。他们就在那里——萨科和万泽蒂。事情是这样的，这两名意大利移民于1921年在波士顿被指控抢劫和谋杀。他们被判有罪并被判处死刑。这场审判真正体现了那个时代的紧张局势。许多人认为萨科和万泽蒂没有得到公正的对待。而发生这种情况的原因——以及他们这样说的原因——往往是在案件审理过程中，他们是意大利移民，他们是激进分子，他们是无政府主义者，他们是第一次世界大战的逃兵。这些成为案件中的问题。尽管世界各地许多人呼吁释放他们，但两人最终还是在1927年被处决。

1920年代发生的另一件事——与移民问题和反激进情绪有关——是三K党的复兴。如果你们还记得，三K党是在内战后重建时期成立的。在20年代，三K党在整个十年中扩大了其影响力。他们不仅在南方，而且在中西部和全国其他地区扩大了影响力。他们的仇恨不再仅仅局限于非裔美国人。他们不仅反对非裔美国人，还反对移民——特别是那些来自南欧和东欧的移民——天主教徒、激进分子以及任何非白人盎格鲁-撒克逊新教徒。

事实上，就在1920年代之前，一部非常受欢迎的亲三K党电影《一个国家的诞生》在美国非常流行。在电影中，三K党是重建时期的英雄。他们将在整个十年中组织起来。他们将变得非常强大——到1925年达到500万成员。他们对美国人民说的是，他们是一个爱国组织。他们主要得到白人新教徒的支持，尤其是在小城镇。三K党本身将施加巨大的政治影响力。你们看到他们在华盛顿特区游行。

到目前为止，这个十年有点令人沮丧，但为什么它被称为咆哮的二十年代呢？其中一件事是大众消费经济的兴起和发展。1920年，美国首次有多数人口居住在城市地区。你们可以在右边的图表中看到——51%。而经济繁荣——总的来说，经济将咆哮起来。股市出现了巨大的增长。而这种增长往往建立在人们的保证金购买之上。他们贷款购买股票。我们将在下一个视频中看到结果如何。他们这样做的原因是他们基于投机进行投资。他们认为这个市场将继续上涨。在大部分时间里，它将一直上涨，直到1929年的大崩盘。

大众消费经济实际上将依赖于大量新的且价格合理的消费品的出现。像真空吸尘器、洗衣机和其他商品将被人们购买。而家庭用电的普及真正导致了对消费类电器的需求增加。一旦人们搬到城市，越来越多的家庭可以使用电力，你们现在就可以拥有这些新的消费品。这些将节省做家务的时间。

为这种消费主义提供动力的是信贷消费。分期付款计划在20年代真正开始大规模推行。其理念是今天拥有，明天付款。因此，现在很多人能够购买他们通常买不起的东西。当然，这样做的缺点是债务。我们将在下一个视频中再次看到这种债务的后果。

广告将在1920年代发挥关键作用。你们在那里看到20年代流行的广告之一——“口臭？口臭让你不受欢迎。所以刷牙吧。”儿童广告业将通过增加人们对各种产品的渴望来操纵消费者需求。

另一个在1920年代真正发生转变的领域是交通运输。弗雷德里克·泰勒的《科学管理原理》——他的整个思想是，工人可以通过消除生产过程中的某些动作来提高生产力，管理层可以通过这种方式提高工人的生产力。而真正采纳了许多这些思想的人是亨利·福特。汽车成为普通美国人能够负担得起的商品——你们可以看到著名的T型车。而亨利·福特引进的流水线真正实现了汽车行业的大规模生产。

虽然铁路运输业将受到汽车的冲击，但由于汽车的兴起，钢铁、橡胶、汽油、公路建设等其他行业将出现巨大的繁荣。汽车不仅带来了经济影响，而且汽车也成为自由和平等的象征。它也将产生社会影响。

飞机发挥了关键作用。事实上，这个故事中的关键人物之一是查尔斯·林德伯格，他成为第一个独自一人飞越大西洋的人。他乘坐单引擎飞机，经过33个多小时的漫长旅程，从纽约飞往巴黎——这很可怕。当他回来时，他成为国家英雄——瞬间成名——因为人们可以通过收音机关注他的旅程。这就引出了大众传媒以及大众传媒对20年代的影响。

理解收音机的影响非常重要。1920年11月，匹兹堡进行了第一次无线电广播。它向美国公众宣布了沃伦·G·哈丁当选总统的消息。实际上，收音机将在将国家联系在一起方面发挥关键作用。它提供了共同的体验。人们在全国范围内收听相同的广告、相同的演讲和相同的娱乐节目。

你们在1920年代也看到了电影业的兴起，尤其是在洛杉矶的好莱坞。这是当时著名的好莱坞标志。电影业本身的创新——1927年出现了《爵士歌手》——它成为第一部有声电影。而像收音机和电影这样的大众传媒的兴起，也带来了1920年代的明星文化。你们有了成为全国性名人的人——比如著名的纽约扬基队的贝比·鲁斯。收音机和电影再次推动了20年代特有的大众消费经济。

1920年代的性别是另一个重要的问题。这个十年的形象是社会习俗受到挑战的十年——不仅来自女性，也来自所有不同的群体。而真正挑战美国社会习俗的是城市里的年轻女性——爵士乐、舞蹈、饮用私酿酒以及对传统价值观的其他挑战。

像真空吸尘器、洗衣机这样的家务劳动节约设备正在改变一些女性家庭主妇的角色。如果你是一位能够负担得起这些新电器的女性，你现在有了更多的空闲时间。而这种年轻女性叛逆的终极象征当然是“飞女郎”。

一些女性在挑战那个时代现有的社会习俗方面走得更远。其中一位女性是玛格丽特·桑格，她公开谈论——尽管遭到抗议，尽管她因违反淫秽法而被捕——支持节育，并要求女性应该有权获得节育措施。

1920年代的这些变化导致了原教旨主义的兴起，最终你们将看到斯科普斯猴子审判。随着这个十年见证了现代城市价值观与农村地区传统价值观之间的斗争，你们将看到原教旨主义运动的兴起。原教旨主义者认为圣经中的每一个词都应该被视为字面意义上的真理。收音机使得像比利·桑迪这样的传教士能够接触到大众听众。他在20年代就是这样做的，他公开反对饮酒、跳舞、爵士乐、赌博以及一些原教旨主义者反对的其他事物。

重大事件发生在 ACLU——美国公民自由联盟——试图挑战田纳西州的一项法律——巴特勒法案——该法案禁止在公立学校教授进化论时。他们找到了一位将违反该法律的教师约翰·斯科普斯。1925年，他因在田纳西州代顿的一所学校教授进化论而被捕。全世界通过收音机关注这场审判——著名的斯科普斯猴子审判，因为它涉及进化论。

你们有全国最好的两位律师。检察官是一位宗教原教旨主义者——也是前总统候选人威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩。辩护律师是克拉伦斯·达罗——可能是那个时代最著名的辩护律师。审判继续进行，斯科普斯被判有罪。他因技术原因被释放。实际上，斯科普斯审判体现了1920年代现代和传统宗教价值观之间的紧张关系。

禁酒是1920年代的关键组成部分。如果你们还记得，第十八修正案于1919年获得批准，它禁止制造和销售酒精饮料。《沃尔斯特德法案》也获得通过，这是执行第十八修正案的联邦法律。禁酒问题极具争议。尤其是在大城市——尤其是在移民社区——对禁止酒精存在强烈的反对。

私酿酒在地下酒吧——非法出售酒精的俱乐部——出售。人们自己酿酒。在许多情况下，他们完全无视法律。部分问题是执法人员不足。没有足够的警察来控制美国边境，以阻止所有不同地区酒精的运输和制造。你们可以在政治漫画中看到的另一个问题是普遍存在的腐败。警察、政客和法官经常被收买而视而不见。

由于禁酒令，有组织犯罪兴起。大人物——著名的人物当然是芝加哥的艾尔·卡彭。你们有像情人节大屠杀这样的事件，暴力事件增加。尽管存在所有这些争议，但在1920年代，饮酒确实有所减少。但最终，禁酒将被视为一项崇高的实验，但会失败。最终，它将在1930年代初被第二十一修正案推翻。而最大的问题是，你们可以使像酒精这样的东西非法，但许多人仍然想要它。因此，他们将无视法律。很棒的照片——人们游行不是为了民权，不是为了自由，而是为了啤酒。

对于非裔美国人来说，1920年代是一个喜忧参半的十年。私刑仍然是一个问题。三K党越来越受欢迎。《吉姆·克劳法》、《普莱西诉弗格森案》——所有这些仍然是生活中的事实。尽管这些挑战很重要，但非裔美国人继续寻找抵抗这种不公正的方法。

回想一下，早在第一次世界大战之前就发生了大迁移，大量的非裔美国人涌入北部城市。爵士乐从新奥尔良传播到纽约和芝加哥等城市。哈莱姆成为美国黑人的非官方文化中心。在20年代，你们发生了一件著名的事件，称为哈莱姆文艺复兴。

你们有像克劳德·麦凯、兰斯顿·休斯、佐拉·尼尔·赫斯顿这样的作家。像路易斯·阿姆斯特朗这样的著名爵士音乐家。实际上，哈莱姆文艺复兴的一个重要思想是“新黑人”的概念。事实上，哈莱姆文艺复兴的大部分作品都强调黑人自豪感、种族自豪感和庆祝黑人社区的文化传统。

在哈莱姆文艺复兴之外，你们有一位名叫马库斯·加维的人。他是来自英国殖民地牙买加的移民。他来到美国，创立了世界黑人进步协会（UNIA）。他将呼吁非裔美国人回到非洲。他信奉分离主义。他认为非裔美国人无法在美国获得公正和平等。但除此之外，加维的运动将促进黑人自豪感、黑人拥有的企业、自信、自力更生、自给自足。他将在动员那些可能没有受到哈莱姆文艺复兴作品影响的普通非裔美国人方面发挥关键作用。他们将被加维的话语所触动。

最后，请务必了解迷惘的一代。这是一群作家，如F·斯科特·菲茨杰拉德、欧内斯特·海明威、辛克莱·刘易斯。他们的作品将批评这个十年的不同方面。他们将质疑参加第一次世界大战的原因，像田纳西州代顿这样的小镇价值观，原教旨主义的宗教观点以及1920年代的物质主义。因此，这群艺术家对过去的旧理想以及新的物质主义文化都感到幻灭。

咆哮的二十年代就到此结束。请务必订阅频道，点赞视频，告诉你的朋友们，祝你度过美好的一天。再见。

Welcome back, APUSH crew. Today we're taking a look at the Roaring 20s. If you're studying the periods 1919 to around 1929 in your APUSH class or using any of these textbooks, this video is going to help you get a five on that APUSH exam.

An important thing to keep in mind is even before the Roaring 20s, there was a fear following World War I. It actually begins during the war. If you recall in 1917, the Communist Party came to power in Russia -- this is the Bolshevik Revolution -- and many Americans were concerned that perhaps this was the start of a communist movement all over the globe.

Strikes actually occur also in 1919. This is a completely separate issue even though some people blame these strikes on radical movements. Most of them were about increasing workers' wages, reducing hours and improving safety conditions. But you get strikes going down in many important industries. You have this great steel strike in 1919, the Boston police strike where police officers actually go on strike. And one of the important outcomes of these strikes is very often the National Guard was called out to break up these strikes, and public opinion throughout the 1920s is going to be very anti-union.

Race riots also occur following -- and in fact during -- the war. This was a result of American cities changing demographically. There was a lot of resentment over competition for jobs between white and black residents and over housing. In fact some of the worst racial riots take place in 1919 in Chicago where over 40 people are killed during the riots.

And then you have bombs go off in 1919-1920 in eight American cities, and many people in the country think that this is the start of a radical movement -- a revolution going to take place in America. And this becomes known as the Red Scare. And it's important to keep in mind that these events you see -- these four things -- are not necessarily connected. But when all of them are happening around the same time -- you have the bombings, you have this Red Scare developing -- and the guy who's going to play a key role during this is the Attorney General of the United States A. Mitchell Palmer. And he's going to lead a series of raids of suspected radicals in the United States, and thousands of people are going to be arrested during these Palmer Raids during the first Red Scare.

Another thing that kind of continues going into the 1920s is once again a rise of nativism. You know the Palmer Raids led to the mass arrest of socialist, anarchist, union organizers or other suspected radicals. And very often these people -- these individuals -- were being arrested for their ideas. And in many cases there was very little evidence if any, because these people were just guilty of believing in things that were unpopular during the decade.

And with this Red Scare, there is going to be a continued hatred towards new immigrants in the 1920s. In fact in 1921 the Quota Act will be passed -- signed into law by President Harding -- and it's going to limit immigration numbers to 3% of those living in the US as of 1910. Add another law to immigration policy called the National Origins Act of 1924. This one sets the quota at 2% of the immigrants in the US, and they used the year 1890. And they used the numbers of the 1890 census. And the reason why they switched that year to 1890 is they're trying to limit the new immigrants that were largely coming in from Southern and Eastern Europe. These immigrants were considered undesirable, and they want to cut off that immigration from those countries in particular. In 1890 is kind of a year where there were less of those immigrants than in years following.

The National Origins Act of 1924 is also going to severely restrict Asian immigrants. In fact no Japanese immigrants are allowed to come at all. But it's important to keep in mind during the 1920s you're going to have unrestricted immigration from the Western Hemisphere. So lots of immigrants coming in especially from Mexico working in jobs in the Southwest predominantly in agriculture.

And one of the most important cases and really symbolic of the anti-immigrant feeling of the 1920s is the case of Sacco and Vanzetti. And there they are -- Sacco and Vanzetti. And what happens is these two men are Italian immigrants who are charged with robbery and murder in 1921 Boston. And they're found guilty and sentenced to death. And this trial really demonstrates the tensions of the era. Many people felt that Sacco and Vanzetti were not receiving justice. And what occurs -- and the reasons why they say this -- is very often during the case it's the fact that they're Italian immigrants, they're radicals, they're anarchists and they're World War I draft dodgers. Those become the issues in the case. And ultimately both men will be executed in 1927 in spite of the fact that there's a lot of people around the world calling for their release.

Another thing about the 1920s that occurs -- kind of connected to the issue of immigration and anti-radical feelings -- is the resurgence of the KKK. If you recall the KKK is created following the Civil War during Reconstruction. And in the 20s the Klan broadens its influence throughout the decade. They expand their influence not just in the South but also in the Midwest and in other regions of the country. And their hatred isn't confined to African-American people exclusively any longer. They are going to speak out and be against not only African-Americans but immigrants -- especially those Southern and Eastern European immigrants -- Catholics, radicals, and any other people that were not white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.

In fact just before the 1920s, a popular film -- a very pro-KKK film -- The Birth of a Nation is extremely popular in the United States. And in the film it is the Klan that are the heroes of Reconstruction. They're going to organize themselves throughout the decade. They're going to become very powerful -- to 5 million members by 1925. And what they are saying to the American people is that they are a patriotic organization. They support -- largely and they're going to get support largely from white Protestants especially in the small towns and cities. And the Klan itself will exert tremendous political influence. Here you see them marching in Washington DC.

So far this decade's been kind of a downer, but kind of why is it called The Roaring 20s? Well one of the things that happens is you have the rise -- the development -- of the mass consumption economy. In 1920 it is the first time a majority of Americans live in urban areas. You could see that on the chart right there -- 51%. And the economic prosperity -- as a whole the economy is going to roar. There's a tremendous growth in the stock market. And very often this growth was built on people buying on margin. They're taking out loans to buy stock. And we're going to see how that turns out in the next video. And the reason they're doing this is they're investing based on speculation. They feel this market is going to continue to go up. And for much of the decade it will go up until the great crash in 1929.

The mass consumption economy is really going to be dependent upon a large number of new and affordable consumer goods becoming available. Things like the vacuum cleaner, the washing machine and other goods are going to be purchased by people. And really electricity in homes leads to this increased demand for consumer appliances. Once people are moving to cities and electricity is available in more and more homes, you can now have these new consumer goods. And these are going to save time in doing things like housework.

Feeding this consumerism was buying goods on credit. The installment plan is really kind of introduced on a wide scale in the 20s. And the idea is you can possess today and pay tomorrow. So of course now lots of people are able to buy things that they normally could not. The downside of this of course is debt. And we're going to see once again the consequences of this debt in our next video.

And advertising is going to play a key role in the 1920s. You see one of the popular ads in the 20s right there -- "Bad breath? Halitosis makes you unpopular. So brush your teeth." Children's advertising industry is going to manipulate consumer demand by increasing people's desire to have various products.

Another area that's going to really transform itself in the 1920s is transportation. Frederick Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management -- and his whole idea was that workers can improve their productivity, that management can improve the productivity of workers by having them eliminate certain motions in the production process. And the guy who really kind of adopts many of these ideas is Henry Ford. Cars become affordable for the average American -- the famous Model T you could see there. And really the assembly line introduced by Henry Ford allows for this mass production to take place in the automobile industry.

Now while the railroad industry is going to be hurt by cars, there is going to be a huge boom in other industries such as steel and rubber and gasoline, highway construction and a whole host of others because of the rise of the automobile. And not just economic impacts of the car, but also the car becomes a badge of freedom and equality. And it's going to have social consequences as well.

The airplane plays a key role. In fact one of the key kind of figures in this story is Charles Lindbergh who becomes the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic. He goes from New York to Paris in a very long journey of over 33 hours in a single engine plane -- some scary stuff. And when he comes back he becomes a national hero -- instant celebrity -- because people are able to follow his journey with the radio. And that leads us to the mass media and the impact of mass media on the 20s.

It's really important to understand the impact of the radio. In November of 1920 we have the first radio broadcast out of Pittsburgh. It announces the election of Warren G. Harding to the American public. And really the radio is going to play a key role in tying the nation together. It provides shared experiences. People are listening to the same advertisements, the same speeches, the same forms of entertainment on a national scale.

You also see in the 1920s the rise of the movie industry and especially in Hollywood -- out in Los Angeles. There is the famous Hollywood sign as it looked back in the day. Innovations in the movie industry itself -- you have The Jazz Singer in 1927 -- it becomes the first talkie. And a part of this rise of mass media like radio and movies is the celebrity culture of the 1920s. You have people that become national celebrities -- people such as Babe Ruth the famous New York Yankee. And the radio and the movie once again fuels the consumption economy that characterizes the 1920s.

Gender in the 1920s is another important thing. This image of the decade was a decade of social customs being challenged -- not just from women but for all different groups. And it was young women in cities that were really challenging the social customs of America -- jazz music, dancing, drinking bootleg liquor and other challenges to traditional values.

Domestic labor saving devices such as the vacuum cleaner, the washing machine are changing the roles of homemakers for some women. If you were a woman who was able to afford these new appliances, you now had more free time. And the ultimate symbol of this kind of youthful rebellion of young women was of course the flappers.

You have some women who go much further with their challenging of existing social customs of the decade. And one of those women is Margaret Sanger who spoke openly -- in spite of protest and in spite of her being arrested for obscenity laws -- in the support of birth control and demanding that women should have the right to have access to birth control.

These changes in the 1920s lead to a growth of fundamentalism and eventually you're going to see the Scopes Monkey Trial. So as the decade is seeing a battle between the values of the modernizing cities and the traditional values of rural areas, you're going to see the growth of a fundamentalist movement. And fundamentalists believe that every word in the Bible should be considered literally true. And the radio allows for preachers such as Billy Sunday to reach a mass audience. And he did so in the 20s when he spoke out against things like drinking and dancing, jazz music and gambling and other things that some fundamentalists opposed.

And the big moment happens when the ACLU -- the American Civil Liberties Union -- sought to challenge a law in Tennessee -- the Butler Act -- that outlawed the teaching of evolution in public schools. And they find a teacher John Scopes who will violate the law. And in 1925 he is arrested for teaching evolution in a school in Dayton, Tennessee. The entire world follows the trial by listening on the radio -- the famous Scopes Monkey Trial because it dealt with evolution.

You have two of the best lawyers in the country. The prosecutor is a religious fundamentalist -- also former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. And the defense attorney is Clarence Darrow -- probably the most famous defense attorney in this time period. The trial goes on and Scopes is convicted. He gets off on a technicality. And really the trial -- the Scopes trial -- demonstrated the tensions between the modern and the traditional religious values of the 1920s.

Prohibition is a key part of the 1920s. If you recall the 18th Amendment was ratified in 1919 and it prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. And the Volstead Act is passed which was the federal law that would enforce the 18th Amendment. The issue of prohibition was very controversial. There was fierce opposition especially in large cities -- especially amongst immigrant communities -- to the banning of alcohol.

Bootleg liquor was served at speakeasies -- illegal clubs where alcohol was sold. People were making their own alcohol. And in many cases they were completely ignoring the law. Part of the problem was there was understaffed law enforcement. There wasn't enough police to police the borders of the United States to get all the different areas where alcohol was being distributed and made. And the other issue you can see in the political cartoon was widespread corruption. Very often police, politicians and judges were paid off to look the other way.

And as a result of prohibition you get the rise of organized crime. The big -- the big guy -- the famous guy is of course Al Capone in Chicago. You have events like the St. Valentine's Day Massacre where violence increases. In spite of all this kind of controversy, drinking does go down in the 1920s. But ultimately prohibition will be seen as a noble experiment that will fail. And eventually it will be overturned with the 21st Amendment in the early 1930s. And the big problem is you can make something like alcohol illegal, but many people still want it. And so they're going to ignore the law. Great photo -- people marching not for civil rights, not for freedom, but for beer.

The decade of the 1920s for African-Americans was a mixed decade. Lynchings continued to be a problem. The KKK was becoming more and more popular. Jim Crow laws, Plessy versus Ferguson -- all of that stuff remained a fact of life. And while those challenges are important, African-Americans continued to find ways to resist this injustice.

Recall there was a Great Migration all the way before World War I where you have this mass movement of African-Americans into Northern cities. And you have the spread of jazz music out of New Orleans into cities such as New York and Chicago. Harlem becomes kind of the unofficial cultural center of Black America. And during the 20s you have a famous event known as the Harlem Renaissance.

You have writers such as Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston. Famous jazz musicians like Louis Armstrong. And really an important idea of the Harlem Renaissance is this idea of the New Negro. In fact there was this emphasis on black pride, racial pride and celebrating the cultural traditions of that black community in much of the Harlem Renaissance's work.

And outside of the Harlem Renaissance you have a guy by the name of Marcus Garvey. He is an immigrant from Jamaica which was a British colony. He comes to the United States and he creates the Universal Negro Improvement Association -- the UNIA. He's going to call for African-Americans to go back to Africa. He believed in separatism. He felt that African-Americans would not be able to get justice and equality in America. But beyond that, Garvey's movement is going to promote black pride, black-owned business, self-confidence, self-reliance, self-sufficiency in the African-American community. And he's going to play a key role in mobilizing ordinary African-Americans who were perhaps not touched by the writings of the Harlem Renaissance. They're going to be touched by the words of Garvey.

And finally make sure you know about the Lost Generation. This is a group of writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis. And their writing is going to criticize different aspects of the decade. They're going to question the reasons for fighting World War I, small town values in places like Dayton, Tennessee, fundamentalist religious views and the materialism of the 1920s. So this group of artists are disillusioned with the old ideals of the past as well as the new materialistic culture.

That's going to close out the Roaring 20s. Make sure you subscribe to the channel, click like on the video, tell your friends and have a beautiful day. Peace.
