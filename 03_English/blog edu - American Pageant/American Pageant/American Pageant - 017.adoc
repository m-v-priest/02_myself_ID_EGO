what it do APUSH 美国历史预修课程 people? today we are going to break down the period from 1848 to 1854. + 
 if you're using the American Pageant, that is chapter 18, but those other books those other chapters will also be covered in this lecture. + 


so following the Mexican-American War 美墨战争, there's a Free Soil movement 自由土壤运动 developing in the United States, and really following this war the issue of slavery in the territories becomes the key cause of sectional tension 地区紧张. + 
 we get all this land following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo 瓜达卢佩-伊达尔戈条约, and there are Americans who say and they join the Free Soil Party which is formed in 1848: there should be no slavery allowed in that area, and their slogan 口号 is "Free Soil, free labor, and free men," and they are opposed to slavery in new land out in the west, so for example California, Nevada, and other areas. + 


now before you go think "oh these dudes are abolitionists 废奴主义者," they're not. + 
 they want keep the West an opportunity for whites only. + 
 they're not against slavery in the South, they just want that land out west to be for free white male laborers. + 
 so it's not necessarily slavery as moral issue. + 


now in the South's mind, they see any attempt to restrict the expansion of slavery as a violation 违反 of their constitutional rights 宪法权利. + 
 so the big question is: what are we going to do with all this land? and in 1848 you have an election: the Whigs 辉格党 pick Zachary Taylor the war hero, they take no position on the issue of slavery in the election. + 
 the Democrats pick Lewis Cass and their whole platform 政纲 on slavery is popular sovereignty 人民主权论, and basically people in the territory should decide whether or not to allow slavery. + 
 the Free Soil party does run a candidate, the former Democrat Martin Van Buren, and they are opposed to the extension of slavery in the territories, kind like the Wilmot Proviso 威尔莫特附文 position. + 
 and Zachary Taylor wins the election, he's a war hero so the nation kind of picks him. + 


but something happens, and that's something that happens is in California gold is discovered in 1848 near Sutter's Mill, and tons and tons of people (you know the 49ers) rush into California territory there near San Francisco. + 
 in fact you get by 1849 something like a 100,000 settlers 移民 coming into California, and gold paves the way for economic growth, and with economic growth becomes a problem, and the problem is sectional tension between the North and the South over California because in 1849 California creates a constitution banning slavery and asks Congress for admission as a free state, and it's really the Gold Rush 淘金热 that accelerates this process towards statehood 州地位. + 


now there is a crisis over Mexican cession 墨西哥割让地 as a result, and really what happens is until California, if you look at that map, there was an equal balance of power: you had 15 free states and 15 slave states, and if California enters the Union as a free state this is going to throw the whole thing off. + 
 and Southerners, keep in mind, are increasingly defensive over the institution of slavery: they saw the Tallmadge amendment 塔尔梅奇修正案 as an attempt to try to ban slavery in Missouri, they saw the Wilmot Proviso as trying to keep slavery out of all of the Mexican territory, and now you have at the same time the underground railroad 地下铁路 been going on, people like Harriet Tubman had been coming to free slaves and taking them up north, and Southerners are putting their foot down. + 
 and you actually have, once California demands admission into the Union as a free state, threats of secession 脱离联邦 among some Southerners. + 
 in fact the most radical Southerners are known as the fire-eaters 火食者, and they actually talk of openly leaving the union. + 
 they plan to meet in Nashville, Tennessee to withdraw from the union of the United States because they see their political future as disappearing if California enters the union. + 


could there be another compromise 妥协 is the question? remember we compromised once with Missouri, we compromised another time with a nullification issue 废止危机, and luckily fortunately you have these two political leaders: Henry Clay the great compromiser, and Stephen Douglas a northern Democrat, who calms the situation down with compromise, and that is the Compromise of 1850 1850年妥协案. + 


and the Compromise of 1850 has a number of parts to it: first, California will be admitted as a free state (so the Northerners get that). + 
 the two territories will be set up: Utah and New Mexico, and the issue of slavery will be left to popular sovereignty (the people in those territories will decide whether or not slavery will be allowed). + 
 slavery will be restricted, or rather the slave trade would be banned in Washington DC. + 
 there would be a tougher fugitive slave law 逃奴法案 for the South (they really wanted this, they felt that the runaway slaves were not being sent back by Northerners), so they request and get in the Compromise of 1850 a very tough new Fugitive Slave Law. + 
 and then finally there's a border dispute between New Mexico and Texas, and Texas agrees to give that land to New Mexico. + 


now Zachary Taylor dies during this political crisis over California, and his vice president Millard Fillmore becomes the president. + 
 so Millard Fillmore calls the Compromise of 1850 this final settlement of sectional division, and oh how wrong he will be, Millard Fillmore. + 


and here's why: things calm down briefly but it's really the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 that kind of causes increased tensions, and the reason why is going to be the Fugitive Slave Act turns the north into a hunting ground for fugitive slaves 逃亡奴隶: Southerners can go north looking for runaways from many many years ago, Northerners who assisted runaways could be arrested, and slaves were forbidden from a jury trial 陪审团审判 (they could not testify in court), and for many Northerners for the first time they are forced to deal with the issue of slavery right in their own backyard. + 


and in fact not only do you see them having to deal with the Fugitive Slave Act, many Northerners for the first time resist the institution of slavery, and moderate Northerners are suddenly sympathetic to the Abolitionist Movement 废奴运动, and there's a growth of the Abolitionist Movement in the north. + 
 it's not a majority of people but Northerners increasingly are concerned. + 
 you have increased support for the Underground Railroad helping slaves reach the North or Canada. + 
 you have personal liberty laws 人身自由法 being passed in different northern states which would not allow the use of local jails for housing of fugitive slaves. + 
 you have vigilance committees 警戒委员会 set up which had the goal of protecting fugitive slaves from slave catchers 奴隶追捕者. + 
 in fact one famous example is Anthony Burns, a runaway slave living in Boston: he is arrested and eventually an angry mob comes to his defense and federal troops are sent into the city of Boston. + 
 so Northerners are resisting and Southerners are outraged. + 


in fact in the 1850s you're going to see the nation becoming more and more polarized 两极分化, and it's really going to be this issue of slavery mainly in the territories but also as you could see a result of the Fugitive Slave Law. + 


now in 1852 there's another election: the Democrats pick Franklin Pierce and he wins the election. + 
 the Whig party is a mess: they are truly divided over the issue of slavery because Northern Whigs support the Fugitive Slave Act, and Southern Whigs don't. + 


and what occurs is any attempts to expand the nation begins to be a challenge more and more frequently. + 
 the debate over slavery slowed any attempts at national expansion. + 
 this idea of manifest destiny 天定命运论: free soilers are going to be suspicious of any expansion under Franklin Pierce. + 
 for instance when a group of Southerners plan to try to buy Cuba from Spain and turn it into a slave state, news of that plan is leaked to the press and free soilers and other Northerners denounce 谴责 this plan because they increasingly fear that the South was attempting to create a slave empire, and so any attempts to acquire Cuba are immediately condemned by the north. + 


although most attempts at expansion fail under President Pierce, the US does agree to purchase a strip of land for $10 million from Mexico in 1853, and make sure you know this is called the Gadsden Purchase 加兹登购地, and we buy this land in that darkish blue and the red circle from Mexico in order to allow for the building of a future transcontinental railroad 横贯大陆铁路 route. + 


the big event that you need to know about is the Kansas-Nebraska Act 堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案 in 1854, and what happens is Stephen Douglas, a northern Democrat from the state of Illinois (right here on the map), wants to secure a railroad route through his home state of Illinois out to the West. + 
 he also wants to encourage Western settlement, but Southerners aren't going to approve any railroad route in this area because it would be north of 36°30' which means it would not have slavery allowed. + 
 so in order to win Southern approval he introduces a bill into Congress called the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and it would set up two territories (Kansas and Nebraska), and the issue of slavery would be decided by popular sovereignty. + 


and what happens in the country is a huge political firestorm 政治风暴 because this act (the Kansas-Nebraska Act) repeals 废除 the Missouri Compromise of 1820 because it's saying that potentially slavery can go north of 36°30', and Northerners oppose the Kansas-Nebraska Act in huge numbers. + 
 the Whig party falls apart, the Republican party is formed, and the reason why (for Northerners) this act opened up slavery to an area that previously it was closed off to. + 


that's going to do it. + 
 in another lecture we'll take a look at the impact of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but for now it's goodbye. +

 if you haven't told the homies tell them about it. +

各位APUSH的同学们，大家好！今天我们将详细分析1848年至1854年这段时期。如果你使用的是《美国纪事》，那就是第18章，但其他书籍的其他章节也将在此次讲座中涵盖。

美墨战争结束后，美国国内兴起了一场自由土地运动，而这场战争之后，领土上的奴隶制问题成为地区紧张关系的主要原因。我们通过《瓜达卢佩-伊达尔戈条约》获得了所有这些土地，一些美国人表示，他们加入了1848年成立的自由土地党：该地区不应允许奴隶制，他们的口号是“自由土地、自由劳动、自由人”，他们反对西部新土地上的奴隶制，例如加利福尼亚、内华达和其他地区。

在你认为“哦，这些人是废奴主义者”之前，他们并不是。他们只想让西部成为白人独有的机会。他们不反对南方的奴隶制，他们只是希望西部土地属于自由的白人男性劳动者。因此，这不一定是一个道德上的奴隶制问题。

在南方看来，任何限制奴隶制扩张的企图都被视为侵犯了他们的宪法权利。因此，最大的问题是：我们将如何处理所有这些土地？1848年举行了一次选举：辉格党推选战争英雄扎卡里·泰勒，他们在选举中对奴隶制问题不持立场。民主党推选刘易斯·卡斯，他们关于奴隶制的整个纲领是人民主权，基本上领土上的人民应该决定是否允许奴隶制。自由土地党确实推选了一位候选人，前民主党人马丁·范布伦，他们反对在领土上扩张奴隶制，有点像威尔莫特但书的立场。扎卡里·泰勒赢得了选举，他是一位战争英雄，所以国家某种程度上选择了他。

但发生了一些事情，那就是1848年在萨特磨坊附近发现了加利福尼亚黄金，成千上万的人（你们都知道的淘金者）涌入了旧金山附近的加利福尼亚领土。事实上，到1849年，大约有10万定居者来到加利福尼亚，黄金为经济增长铺平了道路，而随着经济增长，问题也随之而来，问题是北方和南方之间关于加利福尼亚的地区紧张关系，因为在1849年，加利福尼亚制定了一部禁止奴隶制的宪法，并要求国会允许其作为自由州加入联邦，而正是淘金热加速了这一走向州地位的进程。

结果，墨西哥割让土地引发了一场危机，实际上发生的情况是，在加利福尼亚之前，如果你看看那张地图，权力是平衡的：有15个自由州和15个蓄奴州，如果加利福尼亚作为自由州加入联邦，这将打破整个平衡。记住，南方人越来越捍卫奴隶制机构：他们认为塔马奇修正案试图禁止密苏里州的奴隶制，他们认为威尔莫特但书试图将奴隶制排除在所有墨西哥领土之外，而与此同时，地下铁路一直在运作，像哈丽特·塔布曼这样的人一直在解放奴隶并将他们带到北方，南方人正在坚决反对。事实上，一旦加利福尼亚要求作为自由州加入联邦，一些南方人就发出了脱离联邦的威胁。事实上，最激进的南方人被称为“火食者”，他们实际上公开谈论脱离联邦。他们计划在田纳西州纳什维尔举行会议，脱离美利坚合众国，因为他们认为如果加利福尼亚加入联邦，他们的政治未来就会消失。

是否有可能达成另一项妥协？记住，我们曾经在密苏里问题上妥协过一次，在废除危机问题上又妥协过一次，幸运的是，我们有两位政治领袖：伟大的妥协者亨利·克莱和北方民主党人斯蒂芬·道格拉斯，他们通过妥协平息了局势，那就是1850年妥协案。

1850年妥协案包含若干部分：首先，加利福尼亚将作为自由州加入联邦（北方人得到了这一点）。将建立两个领土：犹他州和新墨西哥州，奴隶制问题将留给人民主权决定（这些领土上的人民将决定是否允许奴隶制）。奴隶制将受到限制，或者更确切地说，奴隶贸易将在华盛顿特区被禁止。南方将有一项更严厉的逃奴法（他们非常想要这个，他们认为北方人没有遣返逃跑的奴隶），因此他们在1850年妥协案中要求并获得了非常严厉的新《逃奴法》。最后，新墨西哥州和德克萨斯州之间存在边界争端，德克萨斯州同意将该土地割让给新墨西哥州。

在加利福尼亚这场政治危机期间，扎卡里·泰勒去世了，他的副总统米勒德·菲尔莫尔成为了总统。因此，米勒德·菲尔莫尔称1850年妥协案为地区分裂的最终解决，哦，他将错得多么离谱，米勒德·菲尔莫尔。

原因如下：局势短暂平静下来，但真正加剧紧张局势的是1850年的《逃奴法》，原因在于《逃奴法》将北方变成了逃亡奴隶的狩猎场：南方人可以去北方寻找多年前逃跑的奴隶，协助逃跑者的北方人可能会被逮捕，奴隶被禁止接受陪审团审判（他们不能在法庭上作证），对于许多北方人来说，他们第一次被迫在自己的后院处理奴隶制问题。

事实上，你不仅看到他们不得不处理《逃奴法》，许多北方人第一次抵抗奴隶制机构，温和的北方人突然同情废奴运动，北方废奴运动蓬勃发展。虽然不是大多数人，但越来越多的北方人对此感到担忧。对帮助奴隶到达北方或加拿大的地下铁路的支持增加。不同的北方州通过了个人自由法，不允许使用当地监狱关押逃亡奴隶。成立了警戒委员会，其目标是保护逃亡奴隶免受捕奴者的侵害。事实上，一个著名的例子是安东尼·伯恩斯，一个住在波士顿的逃亡奴隶：他被捕了，最终一群愤怒的暴徒前来营救他，联邦军队被派往波士顿市。因此，北方人正在抵抗，南方人非常愤怒。

事实上，在1850年代，你将看到国家越来越两极分化，这主要是领土上的奴隶制问题，但也正如你所看到的，《逃奴法》也导致了这种情况。

1852年又举行了一次选举：民主党推选富兰克林·皮尔斯，他赢得了选举。辉格党一团糟：他们确实在奴隶制问题上存在严重分歧，因为北方辉格党支持《逃奴法》，而南方辉格党不支持。

结果是，任何扩张国家的企图都越来越频繁地成为挑战。关于奴隶制的辩论减缓了任何国家扩张的企图。“昭昭天命”的思想：自由土地主义者将怀疑富兰克林·皮尔斯领导下的任何扩张。例如，当一群南方人计划试图从西班牙购买古巴并将其变成一个蓄奴州时，该计划的消息泄露给了媒体，自由土地主义者和其他北方人谴责了该计划，因为他们越来越担心南方试图建立一个奴隶帝国，因此任何收购古巴的企图都立即遭到北方的谴责。

尽管皮尔斯总统领导下的大部分扩张企图都失败了，但美国确实在1853年同意以1000万美元的价格从墨西哥购买一块土地，请务必记住这被称为加兹登购地，我们从墨西哥购买了地图上深蓝色和红色圆圈内的这块土地，以便修建未来的跨大陆铁路。

你需要了解的重大事件是1854年的《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》，事情是这样的，来自伊利诺伊州的北方民主党人斯蒂芬·道格拉斯（地图上的这里）希望确保一条通过他的家乡伊利诺伊州通往西部的铁路路线。他还想鼓励西部地区的定居，但南方人不会批准该地区的任何铁路路线，因为它将位于北纬36°30′以北，这意味着那里不允许奴隶制。因此，为了赢得南方人的支持，他向国会提出了一项名为《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》的法案，该法案将建立两个领土（堪萨斯州和内布拉斯加州），奴隶制问题将由人民主权决定。

结果，全国爆发了一场巨大的政治风暴，因为这项法案（《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》）废除了1820年的《密苏里妥协案》，因为它意味着奴隶制有可能扩展到北纬36°30′以北，北方人强烈反对《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》。辉格党瓦解，共和党成立，原因是（对于北方人来说）这项法案向以前禁止奴隶制的地区开放了奴隶制。

就这样了。在另一节课中，我们将探讨《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》的影响，但现在再见了。如果你还没有订阅乔氏出品，请订阅。如果你还没有告诉你的朋友们，请告诉他们。点赞这个视频，提出你的问题，再见。

what it do APUSH people? today we are
going to break down the period from 1848
to 1854. if you're using the American
Pageant, that is chapter 18, but those
other books those other chapters will
also be covered in this lecture.

so following the Mexican-American War,
there's a Free Soil movement developing
in the United States, and really
following this war the issue of slavery
in the territories becomes the key cause
of sectional tension. we get all this
land following the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo, and there are Americans who say
and they join the Free Soil Party which
is formed in 1848: there should be no
slavery allowed in that area, and their
slogan is "Free Soil, free labor, and free
men," and they are opposed to slavery in
new land out in the west, so for example
California, Nevada, and other areas.

now before you go think "oh these dudes are
abolitionists," they're not. they want keep
the West an opportunity for whites only.
they're not against slavery in the South,
they just want that land out west to be
for free white male laborers. so it's not
necessarily slavery as moral issue.

now in the South's mind, they see any attempt
to restrict the expansion of slavery as
a violation of their constitutional
rights. so the big question is: what are
we going to do with all this land? and in
1848 you have an election: the Whigs pick
Zachary Taylor the war hero, they take no
position on the issue of slavery in the
election. the Democrats pick Lewis Cass
and their whole platform on slavery is
popular sovereignty, and basically people
in the territory should decide whether
or not to allow slavery. the Free Soil
party does run a candidate, the former
Democrat Martin Van Buren, and they are
opposed to the extension of slavery in
the territories, kind like the Wilmot
Proviso position. and Zachary Taylor wins
the election, he's a war hero so the
nation kind of picks him.

but something happens, and that's something that
happens is in California gold is discovered in 1848 near Sutter's
Mill, and tons and tons of people (you
know the 49ers) rush into California
territory there near San Francisco. in
fact you get by 1849 something like a
100,000 settlers coming into California,
and gold paves the way for economic
growth, and with economic growth becomes
a problem, and the problem is sectional
tension between the North and the South
over California because in 1849
California creates a constitution
banning slavery and asks Congress for
admission as a free state, and it's
really the Gold Rush that accelerates
this process towards statehood.

now there is a crisis over
Mexican cession as a result, and really
what happens is until California, if you
look at that map, there was an equal
balance of power: you had 15 free states
and 15 slave states, and if California
enters the Union as a free state this is
going to throw the whole thing off. and
Southerners, keep in mind, are
increasingly defensive over the
institution of slavery: they saw the Tallmadge
amendment as an attempt to try to ban
slavery in Missouri, they saw the Wilmot
Proviso as trying to keep slavery out of
all of the Mexican territory, and now you
have at the same time the underground
railroad been going on, people like
Harriet Tubman had been coming to free slaves and taking them up north, and
Southerners are putting their foot down.
and you actually have, once California
demands admission into the Union as a
free state, threats of secession among
some Southerners. in fact the most
radical Southerners are known as the
fire-eaters, and they actually talk of
openly leaving the union. they plan to
meet in Nashville, Tennessee to withdraw
from the union of the United States
because they see their political future
as disappearing if California enters the
union.

could there be another compromise
is the question? remember we compromised
once with Missouri, we compromised
another time with a nullification issue,
and luckily fortunately you have these
two political leaders: Henry Clay the
great compromiser, and Stephen Douglas a
northern Democrat, who calms the
situation down with compromise, and that is the Compromise of
1850.

and the Compromise of 1850 has a
number of parts to it:
first, California
will be admitted as a free state (so the
Northerners get that).
the two territories
will be set up: Utah and New Mexico, and
the issue of slavery will be left to
popular sovereignty (the people in those
territories will decide whether or not
slavery will be allowed).
slavery will be restricted, or rather the slave trade
would be banned in Washington DC.
there would be a tougher fugitive slave law
for the South (they really wanted this,
they felt that the runaway slaves were
not being sent back by Northerners), so
they request and get in the Compromise
of 1850 a very tough new Fugitive Slave
Law.
and then finally there's a border
dispute between New Mexico and Texas, and
Texas agrees to give that land to New
Mexico.

now Zachary Taylor dies during
this political crisis over California,
and his vice president Millard Fillmore
becomes the president. so Millard Fillmore
calls the Compromise of 1850 this final
settlement of sectional division, and oh
how wrong he will be, Millard Fillmore.

and here's why: things calm down briefly but
it's really the Fugitive Slave Act of
1850 that kind of causes increased
tensions, and the reason why is going to
be the Fugitive Slave Act turns the north
into a hunting ground for fugitive
slaves: Southerners can go north looking
for runaways from many many years ago,
Northerners who assisted runaways could
be arrested, and slaves were forbidden
from a jury trial (they could not testify
in court), and for many Northerners for
the first time they are forced to deal
with the issue of slavery right in their own
backyard.

and in fact not only do you see
them having to deal with the Fugitive
Slave Act, many Northerners for the first
time resist the institution of slavery,
and moderate Northerners are suddenly
sympathetic to the Abolitionist Movement,
and there's a growth of the
Abolitionist Movement in the north. it's
not a majority of people but Northerners
increasingly are concerned. you have
increased support for the Underground
Railroad helping slaves reach the
North or Canada. you have personal
liberty laws being passed in different
northern states which would not allow
the use of local jails for housing of
fugitive slaves. you have vigilance
committees set up which had the goal of
protecting fugitive slaves from slave
catchers. in fact one famous example is
Anthony Burns, a runaway slave living in
Boston: he is arrested and eventually an
angry mob comes to his defense and
federal troops are sent into the city of
Boston. so Northerners are resisting and
Southerners are outraged.

in fact in the 1850s you're
going to see the nation becoming more
and more polarized, and it's really going
to be this issue of slavery mainly in
the territories but also as you could
see a result of the Fugitive Slave Law.

now in 1852 there's another election: the
Democrats pick Franklin Pierce and he
wins the election. the Whig party is a
mess: they are truly divided over the
issue of slavery because Northern Whigs
support the Fugitive Slave Act, and Southern Whigs don't.

and what occurs is any attempts to
expand the nation begins to be a
challenge more and more frequently. the
debate over slavery slowed any attempts
at national expansion. this idea of
manifest destiny: free soilers are going
to be suspicious of any expansion under
Franklin Pierce. for instance when
a group of Southerners plan to try to
buy Cuba from Spain and turn it into a
slave state, news of that plan is leaked
to the press and free soilers and other
Northerners denounce this plan because
they increasingly fear that the
South was attempting to create a slave
empire, and so any attempts to acquire
Cuba are immediately condemned by the
north.

although most attempts at
expansion fail under President Pierce,
the US does agree to purchase a strip of
land for $10 million from Mexico in 1853,
and make sure you know this is called
the Gadsden Purchase, and we buy this land
in that darkish blue and the red circle
from Mexico in order to allow for the
building of a future transcontinental
railroad route.

the big event that you
need to know about is the Kansas-
Nebraska Act in 1854, and what happens is
Stephen Douglas, a northern Democrat from the state of
Illinois (right here on the map), wants to
secure a railroad route through his home
state of Illinois out to the West.
he also wants to encourage Western
settlement, but Southerners aren't going
to approve any railroad route in this
area because it would be north of 36°30'
which means it would not have slavery
allowed. so in order to win Southern
approval he introduces a bill into
Congress called the Kansas-Nebraska Act,
and it would set up two territories
(Kansas and Nebraska), and the issue of
slavery would be decided by popular
sovereignty.

and what happens in the country is a
huge political firestorm because this
act (the Kansas-Nebraska Act) repeals the
Missouri Compromise of 1820 because it's
saying that potentially slavery can go
north of 36°30', and
Northerners oppose the Kansas-Nebraska
Act in huge numbers. the Whig party falls
apart, the Republican party is formed,
and the reason why (for Northerners) this
act opened up slavery to an area that
previously it was closed off to.

that's going to do it. in another lecture we'll
take a look at the impact of the Kansas-
Nebraska Act, but for now it's goodbye. if
you haven't done so subscribe to Joe's
Productions. if you haven't told the
homies tell them about it. click like on
the video, post your questions, and peace.
