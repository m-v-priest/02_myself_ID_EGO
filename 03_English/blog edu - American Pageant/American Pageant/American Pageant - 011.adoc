== 释义

what’s up everyone? today we’re taking a look at the War of 1812 and we’re going to examine the Era of Good Feelings 和睦时期. + 
 this is another Joe’s Productions video to help you out with all of your history needs. + 


so important to keep in mind is the War of 1812 initially 最初 went very poorly for the United States, and there’s a couple of reasons for it: one, the nation was deeply divided - it was opposed by Federalists 联邦党人 in Congress 国会 and also merchants 商人 in the New England region; and our early battles didn’t go so well. + 
 there was a failed invasion 入侵 of Canada that was attempted that was a bust 失败. + 
 and some highlights of the War: the British burned Washington DC (you could see that image right there at the top), and famously the British attempted to defeat Fort McHenry in Baltimore, and the United States did not surrender 投降 at Fort McHenry. + 
 in fact, Francis Scott Key would write the Star Spangled Banner 星条旗之歌 celebrating that battle. + 


eventually the treaty 条约 is signed formally ending the war: the Treaty of Ghent 根特条约. + 
 and nothing was really gained - it’s kind of like uh…​ it’s a stalemate 僵局. + 
 pre - war boundaries 战前边界 are maintained 维持. + 
 the British got tired of fighting (the war in Europe’s over), it’s fighting fatigue 战斗疲劳，and the US really couldn’t defeat England, so both sides say let’s call it quits 停止. + 


two weeks after that treaty is signed, Andrew Jackson defeated the British at a very famous battle: the Battle of New Orleans (right here on the map), and this kind of marks the beginning of Andrew Jackson as a national figure 全国性人物 and national hero 民族英雄. + 


one other thing to keep in mind that happens just as the war is winding down 逐渐结束 is something called The Hartford Convention 哈特福德会议. + 
 and at the Hartford Convention, some Federalists met to discuss their concerns. + 
 they meet in December of 1814 just as the war is ending. + 
 they proposed some amendments 修正案 to require two - thirds vote 三分之二多数票 to declare war. + 
 they’re talking about their grievances 不满 about the war and the Jeffersonian leadership 杰斐逊领导. + 
 but what also happens at the Hartford convention (at the meeting) is some radical 激进的 Federalists encourage secession 脱离；退出联盟 - they talk about possibly leaving the union or at the very least signing A Separate Peace deal 单独媾和协议 with England. + 
 this idea is voted down 否决 by most of the Federalists at the Hartford convention - it never really materializes 实现，but it’s important to note this is establishing a precedent 先例 later used by the south: this idea of secession ("we don’t like what the government’s doing, so we will leave or talk about leaving the union"). + 
 Hartford Convention is also the nail in the coffin 致命一击 for the Federalist Party 联邦党. + 
 even though this idea of secession is not voted on by the members at the Hartford convention, it is seen as unpatriotic 不爱国的 - they are seen as traitors 叛徒，and we’re going to say bye - bye to the Federalist Party as a national party in American politics. + 


now following the war, there is this period called the Era of Good Feelings. + 
 and really, following the War of 1812, there was a huge increase in nationalism 民族主义 in America: we have survived two Wars against England; we are gaining respect of the world Community 国际社会；we have new war heroes like Andrew Jackson; in American literature and art you have American themes 美国主题 being featured by such people such as James Fenimore Cooper; America had begun to industrialize 工业化 because of all the harassments 骚扰 to American shipping 航运；we had conquered the natives (unfortunately for them). + 
 so there is this huge burst 爆发 of nationalism, and the Era of Good Feelings is really kind of symbolized 象征 by the election of James Monroe in 1816. + 
 James Monroe easily defeats his Federalist opponent. + 
 the Democratic Republicans (the party that James Monroe belongs to) is beginning to adopt 采用 some of the Federalist policies we’ll see in just a moment. + 
 and in 1820, the next election, you’re going to see Monroe is kicking butt 大获全胜. + 


the Era of Good Feelings is a period of only one political party: the Democratic Republican party. + 
 this is the Era of Good Feelings, and like I said they’re starting to maintain 维持 some of their traditional principles 传统原则 but they’re also adopting some of the Federalist policies. + 
 so historians refer to this as the Era of Good Feelings. + 


keep in mind important to note: it’s not all good feelings. + 
 even though there is only one political party nationally, you’re going to have some conflicts: you’re going to have growing sectionalism 地方主义 between the North and the South and the West (they want different things); you’re also going to have debates over the American system 美国体系 (which we’re going to talk about in a moment); so there’s going to be debates over whether or not we should have tariffs 关税，the bank of the United States, internal Transportation improvements 国内交通改善 - all of these things are going to cause tension 紧张局势 within the one political party. + 
 and a really big moment happens with slavery - we’ll see how that rears its head 抬头 again. + 
 and then you have the panic of 1819 which really hurts this idea of the Era of Good Feelings. + 


the panic of 1819 is caused by over - speculation 过度投机 of Frontier lands 边疆土地 - people are hoping to buy the land for a low price and sell it high. + 
 and it really is the Panic is the first major economic crash 经济崩溃 under the Constitution. + 
 there’s widespread unemployment 广泛失业，bankruptcy 破产，imprisonment for debt 因债务入狱，and it causes all sorts of problems. + 
 and the panic of 1819 further kind of sours 使变糟 this idea of an Era of Good Feelings. + 


now back to the policies: the American system is really the idea of Henry Clay. + 
 he’s a guy from Kentucky - he’s a congressman 国会议员 in the house of reps - and the American system is really the expression of economic nationalism 经济民族主义. + 
 and like I said, what you’re seeing here is National Republicans adopting policies similar to the Federalists (not all the way, but some), such as the protective Tariff of 1816. + 
 this is the first protective tariff 保护性关税，and you could see on there the reason for it was to protect American goods from British competition by putting this tax on it to make American Goods more attractive. + 
 it’s designed to help American industry and Manufacturing 制造业. + 
 unlike previous tariffs, this is not intended primarily to raise revenue 增加收入 - it is to protect American industry. + 
 there was a fear that England would export a lot of goods to the US, and this would hurt US industry, so this tariff is established after the war of 1812. + 


in order to get other sections of the country to support this tariff (which is going to favor 有利于 the North and the Northeast), Clay intended to use the money to fund Transportation improvements which will benefit other parts of the country. + 


another part of the American system is the Second Bank of the United States 美国第二银行. + 
 this was intended to help ensure financial stability 金融稳定 and to provide credit 信贷 for the nation. + 
 the First Bank of the US expired 到期 in 1811, and State Banks 州立银行 were issuing currency 发行货币 and the economy was much more volatile 不稳定的. + 
 so in 1816, the new National Bank (the Second Bank of the United States) is passed by Congress under Henry Clay’s leadership. + 
 this is going to provide a national currency 国家货币 and financial stability, and it’s going to be put in place for the next 20 years. + 


and then finally, the third part of the American system is internal Transportation improvements. + 
 this is going to be the development of canals 运河 (you can see in the green) and also roads (you can see in the red) to link the nation together, especially the Ohio Valley - not just trade but also military defense 军事防御. + 
 you’re going to connect the interior 内陆 to the east coast. + 


now even though you have National Republicans adopting some policies that are similar to the Federalist Party, it’s important to also keep in mind that Madison and James Monroe repeatedly vetoed 否决 proposals to use federal funds 联邦资金 on roads and canals. + 
 they felt the federal government does not have the right under the Constitution (since it was not explicitly 明确地 mentioned) to do this, and so they vetoed. + 
 so there still was this kind of idea of a limited federal government 有限联邦政府. + 
 and very often the states had to pay for many of these Transportation improvements. + 
 the most famous example is New York completed the Erie Canal 伊利运河 in 1825, and that’s going to be a huge Transportation project during this period. + 


all of these ideas under the American system (the Tariff, the bank, internal improvements) generated debates over whether the policies were benefiting the North or the South, agriculture vs. + 
 industry, and you have growing sectionalism as these debates are taking place. + 


the big sectional debate 地区性辩论 though during this period is actually going to take place as a result of events in Missouri. + 
 little background for you: Missouri petitions 请愿 to enter the Union 联邦 as a slave state 蓄奴州 (you can see Missouri right there on the map). + 
 it is the first part of the Louisiana territory 路易斯安那领地 to try to enter the Union, and it tries to enter as a slave state. + 
 now the problem is currently this would upset the sectional balance 地区平衡 between slave and free states. + 
 there were currently 11 slave states and 11 free states, and this is important for power in Congress (especially in the Senate 参议院). + 
 the addition of Missouri as a slave state would lead to 12 slave states and 11 free states (there you go - math for the day). + 


an amendment 修正案 is proposed in Congress called the Tallmadge amendment 塔尔梅奇修正案 by a New York representative. + 
 it’s added to the Missouri Bill 密苏里法案，and it would have allowed the gradual emancipation 逐步解放 of slaves in Missouri. + 
 it basically said there would be no more slaves allowed into Missouri, and the children of slaves would be free at the age of 25. + 
 and if you kind of follow this to its logical conclusion, that would mean slavery would slowly end in Missouri. + 
 the South sees this as a dangerous step towards abolition 废除奴隶制，and the Tallmadge amendment is defeated in the Senate by Southerners. + 


well in comes Henry Clay again with something known as the Missouri Compromise of 1820 1820 年密苏里妥协案，and it does a couple of things to try to make everyone happy: first, Missouri will enter into the Union as a slave state (you can see right there) - so we’ll have 12 slave states; and Maine (right over here) will enter the Union as a free state (Maine was part of Massachusetts and it becomes its own state); third, above the 36°30' line (what you’re seeing right here) - everything above 36°30' slavery would be prohibited 禁止 in all of this area that had been unorganized as a result of the Louisiana Purchase 路易斯安那购地案 - no slavery would exist in that region. + 


the Missouri Compromise is hugely important: it temporarily stopped growing tensions especially with regard to the issue of slavery, but it does hurt the Era of Good Feelings. + 
 but it does manage to maintain sectional balance for the next 30 - some years. + 
 so shout out to Henry Clay. + 


the Supreme Court 最高法院 is really busy during this time period. + 
 in fact, right from the APUSH framework, you see the Supreme Court decisions established the primacy 首要地位 of the Judiciary 司法机构 in determining the meaning of the Constitution and asserted 宣称 that federal laws took precedent 优先 over state laws. + 
 really under John Marshall (remember he has a lot of federalist beliefs), you see the expansion of the government’s power through the Supreme Court. + 
 recall Marbury versus Madison in 1803 established judicial review 司法审查 (they can determine what laws are constitutional 合宪的 or not), and you get some other cases such as McCulloch versus Maryland in 1819. + 
 basically the state of Maryland tries to tax the bank of the United States - they’re trying to kind of get rid of the bank - and the court rules a state could not tax a federal agency 联邦机构. + 
 the court says "the power to tax is the power to destroy. + 
" and then the decision: they rule the bank of the United States is constitutional, and it’s a dramatic increase once again in the power of the federal government. + 


another case you should know about is Gibbons versus Ogden in 1824. + 
 it ruled that only the federal government (Congress in this case) could regulate interstate trade 州际贸易 (trade between different states). + 
 the important thing to keep in mind about these John Marshall Court decisions is they’re all giving more power to the federal government. + 
 even though the Federalists are gone, you see Federalist principles living on in these Supreme Court decisions. + 


finally, foreign policy developments. + 
 remember up until James Monroe, it’s been US getting picked on 被欺负 by whether it be England or France. + 
 now the US starts to have some stability 稳定 in foreign affairs 外交事务 and diplomatic success 外交成功. + 
 really the guy that’s going to be huge during this time period is Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. + 
 this dude’s like a Jedi 绝地武士 (比喻非常厉害) when it comes to foreign policy success. + 


you have the Anglo - American convention 英美公约 in 1818 between the US and England, and it does a couple of things: one, the United States and England agreed to jointly occupy 共同占领 Oregon Territory 俄勒冈领地 for 10 years (this was really fertile soil 肥沃土地，and the United States and England are going to share it for a period of 10 years); they also set the northern boundary 北部边界 of Louisiana Territory at 49th parallel 北纬 49 度线 (there was some dispute 争议 about how far the Louisiana Purchase went - they settled it at the 49th parallel); they also agreed to share fishing rights 捕鱼权 off the coast of New Foundland 纽芬兰海岸. + 


and then finally you get the Adams - Onís Treaty of 1819 1819 年亚当斯 - 奥尼斯条约: the United States acquired Florida 获得佛罗里达 (and what you’re looking at right there is a young Andrew Jackson). + 
 Spain had some problems controlling Florida: there was all sorts of revolutions popping up in Latin America, and they had to send troops to stop those revolutions; since they couldn’t control it, they had all sorts of issues going on there. + 
 and Andrew Jackson goes into Florida and goes on a bit of a rampage 横冲直撞 in 1818: he destroys some native Villages, he hung some British people, and he took some Spanish towns. + 
 he exceeded his authority 越权，but the US took advantage of it, and Spain gives up Florida rather than losing it for nothing. + 
 the one thing the US does concede 承认 is they agreed to give up claims to Texas (there were some people who were trying to claim that Texas was included in the Louisiana Purchase). + 
 the US says "okay we won’t include Texas" - so this is all part of Spain’s territory - and the US gets Florida under the Adams - Onís treaty. + 


finally, the Monroe Doctrine 门罗主义 (and this is important). + 
 the US feared that Europe would try to recolonize 重新殖民 territory in the Western Hemisphere 西半球. + 
 I mentioned there were revolutions going on in Latin America, and many Latin American countries had gained their independence, and the US is worried especially that Spain would try to reconquer 重新征服 their former colonies. + 
 there also was concerns about Russia - it was creeping around Alaska - that they would go into California and pose a potential threat 构成潜在威胁. + 
 England’s also in the mix: they wanted to keep Europe out of the Western Hemisphere, and they’re really going to use their powerful navy 强大海军 to keep this goal in place. + 
 and they wanted to actually (England wanted to) have a joint declaration 联合声明 with the United States - a declaration saying to the world "stay out of the Western Hemisphere. + 
" and the reason why England is interested in this is of course free trade 自由贸易. + 


well James Monroe decides to not include England on the joint declaration, and we get something called the Monroe Doctrine (actually largely written by Quincy Adams). + 
 it’s written without England, and the US warned Europe to stay out of the Western Hemisphere ("stay the heck out - leave the new Latin American republics alone - no colonization, no intervention - stay out"). + 
 the US does agree to avoid European Affairs in this, and this is really kind of seen as kind of nationalism manifesting itself 表现出来 in its foreign policy declaration 外交政策声明. + 


Europe is angry; England’s kind of disappointed that they weren’t included in it. + 
 but the Monroe Doctrine does not have much immediate impact: the US is still way too weak to try to enforce it if anybody challenged it, and the only reason nobody challenged it was because England was down with these goals as well (and England had the Navy). + 
 but it is important that you know about the Monroe Doctrine because later on (especially in the 1890s, especially under McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt) the US is going to play a huge role in Latin American Affairs, and this is going to sour 恶化 the relationship between the US and its Southern neighbors. + 


that’s going to do it for today. +

大家好！今天我们要探讨1812年战争，以及随后的“美好时代”。这是另一期乔氏出品的视频，旨在帮助你满足所有的历史学习需求。

首先要记住的是，1812年战争初期对美国非常不利，原因有以下几点：第一，国家内部存在严重分裂——国会中的联邦党人和新英格兰地区的商人反对这场战争；其次，我们早期的战斗并不顺利。入侵加拿大的尝试失败了。战争的一些重要事件包括：英国人烧毁了华盛顿特区（你可以在顶部的图片中看到），以及著名的英国人试图攻占巴尔的摩的麦克亨利堡，但美国并没有在麦克亨利堡投降。事实上，弗朗西斯·斯科特·基将写下《星条旗永不落》，以庆祝那场战斗。

最终，正式结束战争的条约签署了：《根特条约》。实际上没有任何一方真正获胜——有点像……僵局。战前边界得以维持。英国厌倦了战斗（欧洲的战争结束了），出现了战争疲劳，而美国也无法击败英国，所以双方都同意休战。

在该条约签署两周后，安德鲁·杰克逊在一场非常著名的战役中击败了英国人：新奥尔良战役（地图上在此），这标志着安德鲁·杰克逊作为国家级人物和民族英雄的崛起。

另一件需要记住的事情是，就在战争即将结束时，发生了一件被称为“哈特福德会议”的事件。在哈特福德会议上，一些联邦党人聚集在一起讨论他们的担忧。他们在1814年12月，即战争即将结束时举行了会议。他们提出了一些修正案，要求以三分之二的票数才能宣战。他们谈论了他们对战争和杰斐逊领导的不满。但哈特福德会议（在会议上）也发生了一些激进的联邦党人鼓励脱离联邦——他们谈到可能脱离联邦，或者至少与英国签署单独的和平协议。这个想法被哈特福德会议上的大多数联邦党人投票否决了——它从未真正实现，但重要的是要注意，这为南方后来使用的一个先例奠定了基础：脱离联邦的想法（“我们不喜欢政府的做法，所以我们将离开或讨论离开联邦”）。哈特福德会议也是联邦党棺材上的最后一颗钉子。尽管哈特福德会议的成员没有投票赞成脱离联邦的想法，但这被视为不爱国——他们被视为叛徒，我们将与联邦党作为美国政治中的一个全国性政党说再见。

战争结束后，出现了一个被称为“美好时代”的时期。实际上，在1812年战争之后，美国的民族主义情绪大幅高涨：我们已经两次战胜英国；我们正在赢得国际社会的尊重；我们有了像安德鲁·杰克逊这样的新的战争英雄；在美国文学和艺术中，詹姆斯·费尼莫尔·库珀等人开始创作具有美国主题的作品；由于美国航运受到各种骚扰，美国已经开始工业化；我们征服了印第安人（这对他们来说是不幸的）。因此，民族主义情绪高涨，“美好时代”真正象征着詹姆斯·门罗在1816年的当选。詹姆斯·门罗轻松击败了他的联邦党对手。民主共和党（詹姆斯·门罗所属的政党）开始采纳一些我们稍后将看到的联邦党政策。在1820年的下一次选举中，你将看到门罗势不可挡。

“美好时代”是只有一个政党的时期：民主共和党。这就是“美好时代”，正如我所说，他们开始坚持自己的一些传统原则，但他们也采纳了一些联邦党的政策。因此，历史学家将此称为“美好时代”。

记住，重要的是要注意：这并非完全是“美好”的时期。尽管全国只有一个政党，但你仍然会看到一些冲突：北方、南方和西部之间的地区主义日益增长（他们想要不同的东西）；你还将看到关于“美国体系”（我们稍后将讨论）的辩论；因此，关于我们是否应该征收关税、建立美国银行、进行国内交通运输改善等问题将引起这个单一政党内部的紧张关系。一个非常重要的时刻是关于奴隶制问题——我们将看到这个问题再次浮出水面。然后是1819年的经济恐慌，这确实损害了“美好时代”的理念。

1819年的经济恐慌是由边疆土地的过度投机造成的——人们希望以低价购买土地并高价出售。实际上，这次恐慌是宪法下的第一次重大经济崩溃。失业、破产和因债务入狱的情况普遍存在，造成了各种各样的问题。1819年的经济恐慌进一步破坏了“美好时代”的理念。

现在回到政策：“美国体系”实际上是亨利·克莱的想法。他是来自肯塔基州的人——他是众议院的议员——“美国体系”实际上是经济民族主义的体现。正如我所说，你在这里看到的是国民共和党人采纳了类似于联邦党人的政策（并非完全一样，而是一些），例如1816年的保护性关税。这是第一个保护性关税，你可以看到其目的是通过征收关税使美国商品更具吸引力，从而保护美国商品免受英国竞争。它旨在帮助美国工业和制造业。与之前的关税不同，这项关税的主要目的不是增加收入——而是保护美国工业。当时人们担心英国会向美国出口大量商品，这将损害美国工业，因此这项关税是在1812年战争后建立的。

为了争取国内其他地区支持这项关税（这将有利于北方和东北部），克莱打算利用这笔资金资助交通运输改善，这将惠及全国其他地区。

“美国体系”的另一个组成部分是美国第二银行。其目的是帮助确保金融稳定并为国家提供信贷。美国第一银行于1811年到期，州银行发行货币，经济波动性更大。因此，在亨利·克莱的领导下，国会在1816年通过了新的国家银行（美国第二银行）。这将提供国家货币和金融稳定，并将持续20年。

最后，“美国体系”的第三个组成部分是国内交通运输改善。这将是运河（你可以在绿色区域看到）和道路（你可以在红色区域看到）的建设，以将国家连接起来，特别是俄亥俄河谷——不仅是为了贸易，也是为了军事防御。你将把内陆地区与东海岸连接起来。

尽管国民共和党人采纳了一些类似于联邦党的政策，但重要的是也要记住，麦迪逊和詹姆斯·门罗多次否决了使用联邦资金修建道路和运河的提案。他们认为联邦政府在宪法下没有这样做的权利（因为它没有明确提及），因此他们否决了。因此，仍然存在这种有限联邦政府的思想。而且，各州常常不得不为许多这些交通运输改善项目买单。最著名的例子是纽约于1825年完成了伊利运河，这是这一时期一个巨大的交通运输项目。

“美国体系”下的所有这些想法（关税、银行、国内改善）引发了关于这些政策是否有利于北方还是南方、农业还是工业的辩论，随着这些辩论的进行，地区主义日益增长。

然而，这一时期最大的地区性辩论实际上将因密苏里州的事件而发生。为你简单介绍一下背景：密苏里州申请以蓄奴州身份加入联邦（你可以在地图上看到密苏里州）。它是路易斯安那领地第一个试图加入联邦的地区，并且试图以蓄奴州身份加入。现在的问题是，目前这将打破蓄奴州和自由州之间的地区平衡。当时有11个蓄奴州和11个自由州，这对于国会（特别是参议院）的权力非常重要。密苏里州作为蓄奴州的加入将导致12个蓄奴州和11个自由州（这就是今天的数学课）。

纽约州的一位代表在国会提出了一项修正案，称为塔尔马奇修正案。它被添加到密苏里法案中，它将允许在密苏里州逐步解放奴隶。它基本上规定不再允许奴隶进入密苏里州，奴隶的孩子在25岁时将获得自由。如果你将其推向逻辑的终点，那将意味着奴隶制将在密苏里州缓慢结束。南方认为这是走向废奴的危险一步，塔尔马奇修正案在参议院被南方人否决了。

这时，亨利·克莱再次提出了被称为1820年密苏里妥协方案的东西，它做了几件事来试图让每个人都满意：首先，密苏里州将以蓄奴州身份加入联邦（你可以在那里看到）——所以我们将有12个蓄奴州；缅因州（就在这里）将以自由州身份加入联邦（缅因州以前是马萨诸塞州的一部分，后来成为一个独立的州）；第三，在北纬36度30分线以上（你在这里看到的）——在路易斯安那购地后尚未组织的这片区域中，所有36度30分线以北的地区都将禁止奴隶制——该地区将不存在奴隶制。

密苏里妥协方案非常重要：它暂时阻止了日益增长的紧张局势，尤其是在奴隶制问题上，但它确实损害了“美好时代”。但它确实在接下来的30多年里维持了地区平衡。所以向亨利·克莱致敬。

最高法院在此期间非常忙碌。事实上，从APUSH框架中，你可以看到最高法院的判决确立了司法部门在解释宪法方面的首要地位，并宣称联邦法律优先于州法律。在约翰·马歇尔（记住他有很多联邦党的信念）的领导下，你确实看到了政府权力通过最高法院的扩张。回想一下1803年的马伯里诉麦迪逊案确立了司法审查制度（他们可以决定哪些法律符合宪法），你还会看到其他一些案件，例如1819年的麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案。基本上，马里兰州试图对美国银行征税——他们试图摆脱这家银行——法院裁定州不能对联邦机构征税。法院说“征税权就是毁灭权”。然后是判决：他们裁定美国银行符合宪法，这再次大幅增加了联邦政府的权力。

你应该了解的另一个案例是1824年的吉布斯诉奥格登案。该案裁定只有联邦政府（在本案中是国会）才能 регулировать 州际贸易（不同州之间的贸易）。关于约翰·马歇尔法院的这些判决，需要记住的重要一点是，它们都赋予了联邦政府更多的权力。即使联邦党已经消失，你仍然可以在这些最高法院的判决中看到联邦党原则的延续。

最后是外交政策的发展。记住，直到詹姆斯·门罗时期，美国一直受到英国或法国的欺负。现在，美国开始在外交事务中获得一些稳定和外交上的成功。在此期间真正发挥巨大作用的人是国务卿约翰·昆西·亚当斯。这家伙在外交政策的成功方面简直就是一位绝地大师。

1818年，美国和英国签署了《英美公约》，该公约做了几件事：第一，美国和英国同意共同占领俄勒冈领土10年（这片土地非常肥沃，美国和英国将在10年内共同拥有）；他们还将路易斯安那领地的北部边界设定在北纬49度（关于路易斯安那购地的范围存在一些争议——他们将其确定在北纬49度）；他们还同意共享纽芬兰沿海的捕鱼权。

然后，最终在1819年签署了《亚当斯-奥尼斯条约》：美国获得了佛罗里达（你在这里看到的是年轻的安德鲁·杰克逊）。西班牙在控制佛罗里达方面遇到了一些问题：拉丁美洲爆发了各种各样的革命，他们不得不派遣军队镇压这些革命；由于他们无法控制佛罗里达，那里出现了各种各样的问题。安德鲁·杰克逊于1818年进入佛罗里达，进行了一番横冲直撞：他摧毁了一些印第安村庄，绞死了一些英国人，并占领了一些西班牙城镇。他超越了自己的权限，但美国利用了这一点，西班牙放弃了佛罗里达，而不是白白失去它。美国唯一让步的是，他们同意放弃对德克萨斯的主张（有些人试图声称德克萨斯包含在路易斯安那购地中）。美国说“好吧，我们不会包括德克萨斯”——所以这仍然是西班牙的领土——美国通过《亚当斯-奥尼斯条约》获得了佛罗里达。

最后是门罗主义（这很重要）。美国担心欧洲会试图重新殖民西半球的领土。我提到拉丁美洲正在发生革命，许多拉丁美洲国家已经获得独立，美国尤其担心西班牙会试图重新征服其前殖民地。人们还担心俄罗斯——它在阿拉斯加附近活动——他们可能会进入加利福尼亚并构成潜在威胁。英国也参与其中：他们想将欧洲势力排除在西半球之外，他们将真正利用其强大的海军来实现这一目标。他们实际上想（英国想）与美国发表一份联合声明——一份向世界宣告“远离西半球”的声明。英国对此感兴趣的原因当然是自由贸易。

然而，詹姆斯·门罗决定不与英国发表联合声明，于是我们得到了被称为门罗主义的东西（实际上很大程度上由昆西·亚当斯撰写）。它是在没有英国参与的情况下撰写的，美国警告欧洲远离西半球（“滚出去——不要打扰新的拉丁美洲共和国——不准殖民，不准干涉——滚出去”）。美国同意在此问题上避免干预欧洲事务，这实际上被视为民族主义在其外交政策声明中的体现。

欧洲很生气；英国对没有被包括在内有点失望。但门罗主义并没有产生多少直接影响：如果有人挑战它，美国仍然太弱而无法执行它，而没有人挑战它的唯一原因是英国也赞同这些目标（而且英国拥有海军）。但重要的是你要了解门罗主义，因为后来（尤其是在1890年代，尤其是在麦金利和西奥多·罗斯福时期），美国将在拉丁美洲事务中发挥巨大作用，这将恶化美国与其南方邻国的关系。

what's up everyone? today we're taking a
look at the War of 1812 and we're going
to examine the Era of Good Feelings. this
is another Joe's Productions video to
help you out with all of your history
needs.

so important to keep in mind is
the War of 1812 initially went very
poorly for the United States, and there's
a couple of reasons for it: one, the
nation was deeply divided - it was opposed
by Federalists in Congress and also
merchants in the New England region; and
our early battles didn't go so well.
there was a failed invasion of Canada
that was attempted that was a bust. and
some highlights of the War: the British
burned Washington DC (you could see that
image right there at the top), and
famously the British attempted to defeat
Fort McHenry in Baltimore, and the United
States did not surrender at Fort McHenry.
in fact, Francis Scott Key would write the
Star Spangled Banner celebrating that
battle.

eventually the treaty is signed
formally ending the war: the Treaty of
Ghent. and nothing was really gained - it's
kind of like uh... it's a stalemate. pre-war
boundaries are maintained. the British
got tired of fighting (the war in
Europe's over), it's fighting fatigue, and
the US really couldn't defeat England, so
both sides say let's call it quits.

two
weeks after that treaty is signed, Andrew
Jackson defeated the British at a very
famous battle: the Battle of New Orleans
(right here on the map), and this kind of
marks the beginning of Andrew Jackson as
a national figure and national hero.

one
other thing to keep in mind that happens
just as the war is winding down is
something called The Hartford Convention.
and at the Hartford Convention, some
Federalists met to discuss their
concerns. they meet in December of 1814
just as the war is ending. they proposed
some amendments to require two-thirds vote
to declare war. they're talking about
their grievances about the war and the
Jeffersonian
leadership. but what also happens at the
Hartford convention (at the meeting) is
some radical Federalists encourage
secession - they talk about possibly
leaving the union or at the very least
signing A Separate Peace deal with
England. this idea is voted down by most
of the Federalists at the Hartford
convention - it never really materializes,
but it's important to note this is
establishing a precedent later used by
the south: this idea of secession ("we
don't like what the government's doing, so we
will leave or talk about leaving the
union"). Hartford Convention is also the
nail in the coffin for the Federalist
Party. even though this idea of secession
is not voted on by the members at the
Hartford convention, it is seen as
unpatriotic - they are seen as traitors, and
we're going to say bye-bye to the
Federalist Party as a national party in
American politics.

now following the war,
there is this period called the Era of
Good Feelings. and really, following the
War of 1812, there was a huge increase in
nationalism in America: we have survived
two Wars against England; we are gaining
respect of the world Community; we have
new war heroes like Andrew Jackson; in
American literature and art you have
American themes being featured by such
people such as James Fenimore Cooper;
America had begun to industrialize
because of all the harassments to
American shipping; we had conquered the
natives (unfortunately for them). so there
is this huge burst of nationalism, and
the Era of Good Feelings is really kind
of symbolized by the election of James
Monroe in 1816. James Monroe easily
defeats his Federalist opponent. the
Democratic Republicans (the party that
James Monroe belongs to) is beginning to
adopt some of the Federalist policies
we'll see in just a moment. and in 1820,
the next election, you're going to see
Monroe is kicking butt.

the Era of Good
Feelings is a period of only one
political party:
the Democratic Republican party. this is
the Era of Good Feelings, and like I said
they're starting to maintain some of
their traditional principles but they're
also adopting some of the Federalist
policies. so historians refer to this as
the Era of Good Feelings.

keep in mind
important to note: it's not all good
feelings. even though there is only one
political party nationally, you're going
to have some conflicts: you're going to
have growing sectionalism between the
North and the South and the West (they
want different things); you're also going
to have debates over the American system
(which we're going to talk about in a
moment); so there's going to be debates
over whether or not we should have
tariffs, the bank of the United States,
internal Transportation improvements - all
of these things are going to cause
tension within the one political party.
and a really big moment happens with
slavery - we'll see how that rears its
head again. and then you have the panic
of 1819 which really hurts this idea of
the Era of Good Feelings.

the panic of 1819
is caused by over-speculation of Frontier
lands - people are hoping to buy the land
for a low price and sell it high. and it
really is the Panic is the first major
economic crash under the Constitution.
there's
widespread unemployment, bankruptcy,
imprisonment for debt, and it causes all
sorts of problems. and the panic of 1819
further kind of sours this idea of an Era
of Good Feelings.

now back to the
policies: the American system is really
the idea of Henry Clay. he's a guy from
Kentucky - he's a congressman in the house
of reps - and the American system is
really the expression of economic
nationalism. and like I said, what you're
seeing here is National Republicans
adopting policies similar to the
Federalists (not all the way, but some),
such as the protective Tariff of
1816. this is the first protective tariff,
and you could see on there the reason
for it was to protect American goods
from British competition by putting this
tax on it to make American Goods more
attractive. it's designed to help
American industry and Manufacturing.
unlike previous tariffs, this is not
intended primarily to raise revenue - it
is to protect American industry. there
was a fear that England would export a
lot of goods to the US, and this would
hurt US industry, so this tariff is
established after the war of 1812.

in
order to get other sections of the
country to support this tariff (which is
going to favor the North and the
Northeast), Clay intended to use the money
to fund Transportation improvements
which will benefit other parts of the
country.

another part of the American
system is the Second Bank of the United
States. this was intended to help ensure
financial stability and to provide
credit for the nation. the First Bank of
the US expired in 1811, and State Banks
were issuing currency and the economy
was much more volatile. so in 1816, the
new National Bank (the Second Bank of the
United States) is passed by Congress
under Henry Clay's leadership. this is
going to provide a national currency and
financial stability, and it's going to be
put in place for the next 20 years.

and
then finally, the third part of the
American system is internal
Transportation improvements. this is
going to be the development of canals
(you can see in the green) and also roads
(you can see in the red) to link the
nation together, especially the Ohio
Valley - not just trade but also
military defense. you're going to connect
the interior to the east coast.

now even
though you have National Republicans
adopting some policies that are similar
to the Federalist Party, it's important
to also keep in mind that Madison and
James Monroe repeatedly vetoed proposals
to use federal funds on roads and canals.
they felt the federal government does
not have the right under the
Constitution (since it was not explicitly
mentioned) to do this, and so they vetoed.
so there still was this kind of idea of
a limited federal government. and very
often the states had to pay for many of
these Transportation improvements. the
most famous example is New York
completed the Erie Canal in
1825, and that's going to be a huge
Transportation project during this
period.

all of these ideas under the
American system (the Tariff, the bank,
internal improvements) generated debates
over whether the policies were
benefiting the North or the South,
agriculture vs. industry, and you have
growing sectionalism as these debates
are taking place.

the big sectional
debate though during this period is
actually going to take place as a result
of events in Missouri. little background
for you: Missouri petitions to enter the
Union as a slave state (you can see
Missouri right there on the map). it is
the first part of the Louisiana
territory to try to enter the Union, and
it tries to enter as a slave state. now
the problem is currently this would
upset the sectional balance between
slave and free states. there were
currently 11 slave states and 11 free
states, and this is important for power
in Congress (especially in the Senate). the
addition of Missouri as a slave state
would lead to 12 slave states and 11
free states (there you go - math for the
day).

an amendment is proposed in Congress
called the Tallmadge amendment by a New York
representative. it's added to the
Missouri Bill, and it would have allowed
the gradual emancipation of slaves in
Missouri. it basically said there would
be no more slaves allowed into Missouri,
and the children of slaves would be free
at the age of 25. and if you kind of
follow this to its logical conclusion,
that would mean slavery would slowly end
in Missouri. the South sees this as a
dangerous step towards abolition, and the
Tallmadge amendment is defeated in the Senate
by Southerners.

well in comes Henry Clay
again with something known as the
Missouri Compromise of 1820, and it does
a couple of things to try to make
everyone happy: first, Missouri will enter
into the Union as a slave state (you can
see right there) - so we'll have 12 slave
states; and Maine (right over here) will
enter the Union as a free state (Maine
was part of Massachusetts and it becomes
its own state); third, above the 36°30' line
(what you're seeing right here) - everything
above 36°30' slavery would be prohibited
in all of this area that had been
unorganized as a result of the Louisiana
Purchase - no slavery would exist in that
region.

the Missouri Compromise is hugely
important: it temporarily stopped
growing tensions especially with regard
to the issue of slavery, but it does hurt
the Era of Good Feelings. but it does
manage to maintain sectional balance for
the next 30-some years. so shout out to
Henry Clay.

the Supreme Court is really
busy during this time period. in fact,
right from the APUSH framework, you see
the Supreme Court decisions
established the primacy of the Judiciary
in determining the meaning of the
Constitution and asserted that federal
laws took precedent over state laws.
really under John Marshall (remember he
has a lot of federalist beliefs), you see
the expansion of the government's power
through the Supreme Court. recall Marbury
versus Madison in 1803 established
judicial review (they can determine what
laws are constitutional or not), and you
get some other cases such as McCulloch
versus Maryland in 1819.
basically the state of Maryland tries to
tax the bank of the United States -
they're trying to kind of get rid of the
bank - and the court rules a state could
not tax a federal agency. the court says
"the power to tax is the power to destroy."
and then the decision: they rule the bank
of the United States is constitutional,
and it's a dramatic increase once again
in the power of the federal government.

another case you should know about is
Gibbons versus Ogden in 1824. it ruled
that only the federal government
(Congress in this case) could regulate
interstate trade (trade between different
states). the important thing to keep in
mind about these John Marshall Court
decisions is they're all giving more
power to the federal government. even
though the Federalists are gone, you see
Federalist principles living on in these
Supreme Court decisions.

finally, foreign
policy developments. remember up until
James Monroe, it's been US getting picked
on by whether it be England or France.
now the US starts to have some stability
in foreign affairs and diplomatic
success. really the guy that's going to
be huge during this time period is
Secretary of State John Quincy Adams.
this dude's like a Jedi when it comes to
foreign policy success.

you have the
Anglo-American convention in 1818
between the US and England, and it does a
couple of things: one, the United States
and England agreed to jointly occupy
Oregon Territory for 10 years (this was
really fertile soil, and the United
States and England are going to share it
for a period of 10 years); they also set
the northern boundary of Louisiana
Territory at 49th parallel (there was
some dispute about how far the Louisiana
Purchase went - they settled it at the 49th
parallel); they also agreed to share
fishing rights off the coast of New
Foundland.

and then finally you get the
Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819: the United
States acquired Florida (and what you're
looking at right there is a young Andrew
Jackson). Spain had some problems
controlling Florida: there was all sorts
of revolutions popping up in Latin
America, and they had to send troops to
stop those revolutions; since they
couldn't control it, they had all sorts
of issues going on there. and Andrew
Jackson goes into Florida and goes on a
bit of a rampage in 1818: he destroys
some native Villages, he hung some
British people, and he took some Spanish
towns. he exceeded his authority, but the
US took advantage of it, and Spain
gives up Florida rather than losing it
for nothing. the one thing the US does
concede is they agreed to give up claims
to Texas (there were some people who were
trying to claim that Texas was included
in the Louisiana Purchase). the US says
"okay we won't include Texas" - so this is
all part of Spain's territory - and the US
gets Florida under the Adams-Onís treaty.

finally, the Monroe Doctrine (and this is
important). the US feared that Europe
would try to recolonize territory in the
Western Hemisphere. I mentioned there
were revolutions going on in Latin
America, and many Latin American
countries had gained their independence,
and the US is worried especially that
Spain would try to reconquer their
former colonies. there also was concerns
about Russia - it was creeping around
Alaska - that they would go into
California and pose a potential threat.
England's also in the mix: they wanted to
keep Europe out of the Western
Hemisphere, and they're really going to
use their powerful navy to keep this
goal in place. and they wanted to
actually (England wanted to) have a joint
declaration with the United States - a
declaration saying to the world "stay out
of the Western Hemisphere." and the reason
why England is interested in this is of
course free trade.

well James Monroe
decides to not include England on the
joint declaration, and we get something
called the Monroe Doctrine (actually
largely written by Quincy Adams). it's
written without England, and the US
warned Europe to stay out of the Western
Hemisphere ("stay the heck out - leave the
new Latin American republics alone - no
colonization, no intervention - stay out").
the US does agree to avoid European
Affairs in this, and this is really kind
of seen as kind of nationalism
manifesting itself in its foreign policy
declaration.

Europe is angry; England's
kind of disappointed that they weren't
included in it. but the Monroe Doctrine
does not have much immediate impact: the
US is still way too weak to try to
enforce it if anybody challenged it, and
the only reason nobody challenged it was
because England was down with these
goals as well (and England had the Navy).
but it is important that you know about
the Monroe Doctrine because later on
(especially in the 1890s, especially under
McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt) the US
is going to play a huge role in Latin
American Affairs, and this is going to
sour the relationship between the US
and its Southern neighbors.
