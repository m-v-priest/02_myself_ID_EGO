Hello, beautiful people. In this video, I'm going to review 20-ish mistakes students in US history APUSH 美国历史大学先修课程 and most folks make about American history. For you APUSH students, these are things you're gonna want to avoid saying on any APUSH exam because if you do, your teacher and America will cry.

The first one is the most essential thing you should remember about the study of history, and it's this -- people make lots of absolute statements 绝对性陈述 and rarely recognize nuance 细微差别 in history. Avoid absolute statements in history. "Everyone wanted freedom." "Everyone violated prohibition 禁酒令." "The North hated slavery." "Everybody was poor." "Nobody liked season eight of Game of Thrones." No. Blanket statements 笼统陈述 or over-generalizations 过度概括 -- leave that to dumb politicians. There are absolutely no absolutes in history.

Here's the first one -- students like to say that Native Americans are this monolithic group 单一群体. The truth is indigenous people 原住民 are very diverse mix of people. They adapted to a variety of environments. They had different social structures. Some formed alliances 联盟 with European powers. Many got screwed over 被欺骗. But there is no one Native American experience.

Another mistake is confusing the Chesapeake and the New England regions. The truth is the thirteen colonies were quite diverse. Different people came for different motives 动机 to different environments. So the Chesapeake is not where the pilgrims 清教徒 partied it up on Thanksgiving -- cranberry and all that stuff. And New England is not where Pocahontas was sliding into some dude named John's DMs 私信. So know the difference between these two regions.

"Bacon's Rebellion led to slavery." The truth is Bacon's Rebellion accelerated the transition of indentured servants 契约佣工 to African slavery as a labor source, but slavery was established in the colonies in 1619. It is important you know about Bacon's Rebellion, but don't get it twisted 搞混 and oversimplify things. Yes, it led to the growth of the institution of slavery, but sadly slavery was a fact of colonial life well before Bacon's Rebellion.

"The French and Indian War was between the French and Native Americans." Here's the truth -- the war was the French and their Native American allies 盟友 versus the British, the colonists (kind of) who were reluctant to fight and very few of their native allies. So remember during this war the French had most of the natives on their side.

"Right after the French and Indian War, many colonists wanted independence from England." That is false. Truth -- there was a slow movement towards independence between the year 1763 and 1776. Everybody hears the French and Indian War and taxes independence, but history is not that simple. Yes, taxes followed the war and the relationship between mama and the colonies became strained 紧张, but it took a lot of things to happen -- you can see them right there -- to get us to the American Revolution. I mean shots in 1775 were fired at Lexington and Concord, and they were still trying to work things out.

Another mistake -- "The American Revolution was fought primarily over taxes." The truth is colonists were inspired by Enlightenment ideals 启蒙思想, desire for self-government 自治, and resistance to new British imperial efforts 帝国政策. Yes, very few people liked taxes, and some colonists dumped tea in harbor, and colonists had some dope bars like "no taxation without representation 无代表不纳税." But ideas and natural rights 自然权利, wanting more autonomy 自治权 and self-government, and resistance to the British ending salutary neglect 有益的忽视 and imposing taxes and enforcing existing laws all played a role. It's not just taxes.

I've seen a ton of people say "Everyone in the colonies wanted independence from England." Here's the truth -- colonial society was divided between loyalists 保皇派, Patriots 爱国者, and those who did not give up. You know what? You know it feels good to say everyone was eating hotdogs, lighting off fireworks for freedom after the Declaration of Independence, but the reality is way more complicated.

Mistake often made -- "The Articles of Confederation 邦联条例 was a total failure." The truth -- Articles did govern the nation during the American Revolution and created the Northwest Ordinances 西北法令. Look, I'm typically a Debbie Downer 悲观主义者 type of guy -- Mr. Negative -- but we need to give credit to the AOC. Yes, it couldn't tax, was hella weak, but it did do some good stuff.

"The three-fifths compromise 五分之三妥协 gave slaves three-fifths of a vote. It was a good thing for black people." The truth -- the three-fifths compromise dealt with how slaves would be counted for representation in Congress in the House of Representatives. No. Any time you're talking about humans in terms of fractions, it's probably not a good thing. But I've seen so many students say the three-fifths gave African-Americans three-fifths rights. Nope. Nope. Nope. Basically the South wanted their slaves to count not because they wanted to extend rights to them, but because the more people you have, the more reps you get. So at the Constitutional Convention, we compromised our values and said let's count each slave as three-fifths humans so both the North and the South can be content with this new constitution.

"The Federalists versus the anti-Federalists were political parties." Nope. The first two-party system is Federalist versus the Democratic-Republicans in the 1790s. The anti-Federalists and the Federalists represent the two sides of the debate over ratification 批准. Federalists were on Team Constitution, and the anti-Federalists were like "nah, no ratification to the Constitution." So the first two-party system is not until the 1790s when debates over Hamilton's plan and other issues led to the rise of political parties. And yes, one of them is the Federalist, and yes many anti-Federalists will be Democratic-Republicans, but the anti-Federalists were not a political party.

I don't know how many times I've seen students go "What the hell is the antebellum period 战前时期?" All it is is the period used to describe the period before the Civil War. Students always get confused about this. So basically it's the time period roughly 1820s and has no official start date up until the Civil War.

A lot of students don't know about the second two-party system. This is basically the Whigs 辉格党 versus the Democrats, and you best know about it. This is the whole Whigs versus Democrats and basically the Whigs are beefing with Andrew Jackson over the bank and a whole bunch of other issues. So first two-party system -- Federalists versus Democratic-Republicans. This is the second two-party system in the 1830s-40s.

I've seen my fair share of students say the Mexican-American War is the same thing as the Spanish-American War. The truth is the Mexican-American War took place from 1846 to 1847. The Spanish-American War took place in 1898. And if you think they're the same, you might be racist or hopefully just confused. Spain and Mexico are different places. The Mexican-American War is where we took half of Mexico's territory and opened up questions regarding slavery in those territories once again. And the Spanish-American War is when we took a bunch of Spain's colonies and it led to debates about the role of America in the world. They're different.

This next one is a tough one. It's not "sexual ISM increased and the South succeeded." It is "sectionalism 地方主义 increased and the South seceded 脱离联邦." There's a difference.

This is probably the most popular one -- "The North was against slavery." The truth is even on the eve of the Civil War, abolition 废奴主义 was not a majority movement in the North. It would be nice if things were so simple -- North free, South slave -- but they are not. Yes, many Northerners in the 1840s and 50s came to oppose the extension of slavery in the territories. Many did not like the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. But the actual abolition of slavery was not very popular. With that being said, that's why these peeps are even more badass because of what they did and struggled against.

This one's another popular mistake -- "The Emancipation Proclamation 解放宣言 freed all the slaves and Lincoln was an abolitionist." The truth is Lincoln's main goal was preserving the Union, and the Emancipation Proclamation was passed as a war measure 战时措施 and only freed slaves in territory that was in rebellion. This is another thing that is overly simplified and that can go into great detail about it because you know what would -- what did Lincoln really believe personally versus politically? But the basics are this -- know Lincoln was not trying to end slavery everywhere when he was elected in 1860. It was a Free Soil position 自由土地立场, and the EP only applied to the Confederacy because Lincoln didn't want to piss off the border states that also had slaves but were still loyal to the Union.

"The Seneca Falls Convention 塞内卡福尔斯会议 immediately led to the 19th Amendment." Here's the truth -- 1848 and 1920 are different years. Yes, at Seneca Falls, a group of women and a few men demanded suffrage 选举权 and other things, and this is often seen as the start of the woman's suffrage movement. But this convention happened in 1848, and a lot of stuff happened -- both setbacks 挫折 and steps towards getting to the 19th Amendment. Women got passed over for the vote when the 15th Amendment was adopted. Women played a big role in the many progressive reforms 进步改革. The impacts of World War One, yadda yadda yadda. So don't make this huge leap in your thinking, skipping historical developments. History is often a struggle, and so results are oftentimes not immediate.

Speaking of suffrage, a lot of students like to say "The women's suffrage movement fought for the rights of all women." The truth is more complicated. The woman's suffrage movement disagreed on tactics 策略 and whether African American women or women of color in general should be included in suffrage. It would be dope if the movement for suffrage was fighting for all women, but sadly this is not how it went down. Women's suffrage movement is a broad term spanning many decades, and there were disagreements not only about tactics -- should we go for a constitutional amendment (shoutout Alice Paul) or go state-by-state (Carrie Chapman Catt) -- but also many women openly rejected including African American women in the right to vote. That's why when Ida Wells Barnett started marching, it was a big deal over there on the right.

"The Fifteenth Amendment guaranteed the right of African American men to vote." Here's the truth -- following the end of Reconstruction 重建时期, southern states adopted tests, poll taxes 人头税, property requirements, grandfather clauses 祖父条款, and outright violence to disenfranchise 剥夺选举权 black voters. We all know the fairy tale version -- after the Civil War, slaves were free. The 13th, 14th Amendments made everything wonderful, provided a bunch of rights. And yes, Fifteenth Amendment did guarantee the right to vote regardless of race. But an amendment is only as good as its enforcement and the desire to uphold it. And after Reconstruction was abandoned, so were voting rights for most African American individuals in the south.

That's gonna do it for this video. Hopefully this clears up a few misunderstandings you may have and prevent you from making them on your exam. Remember the key to success in history and APUSH is thinking critically 批判性思考. And we have all sorts of videos to review the American experience on our website APUSHExplained.com.

大家好，各位！在这个视频中，我将回顾大约20个美国历史APUSH（美国历史大学先修课程）学生和大多数人在美国历史上常犯的错误。对于你们APUSH学生来说，这些是你们在任何APUSH考试中都要避免说的事情，因为如果你们说了，你们的老师和美国都会哭泣。

第一个是你们在历史研究中应该记住的最重要的事情，那就是——人们经常做出绝对的陈述，而很少认识到历史的细微差别。在历史中避免绝对的陈述。“每个人都想要自由。”“每个人都违反了禁酒令。”“北方憎恨奴隶制。”“每个人都很穷。”“没有人喜欢《权力的游戏》第八季。”不。一概而论或过度概括——把这些留给愚蠢的政客吧。历史中绝对没有绝对的事情。

第一个错误是——学生们喜欢说美洲原住民是一个单一的群体。事实是，土著人民是非常多样化的人群的混合体。他们适应了各种各样的环境。他们有不同的社会结构。有些人与欧洲列强结盟。许多人被坑害了。但没有一种单一的美洲原住民经验。

另一个错误是混淆切萨皮克地区和新英格兰地区。事实是，十三个殖民地非常多样化。不同的人出于不同的动机来到不同的环境。所以切萨皮克不是朝圣者在感恩节狂欢的地方——蔓越莓什么的。新英格兰也不是波卡洪塔斯给一个叫约翰的家伙发私信的地方。所以要了解这两个地区之间的区别。

“培根叛乱导致了奴隶制。”事实是，培根叛乱加速了从契约奴隶到非洲奴隶作为劳动力来源的转变，但奴隶制早在1619年就在殖民地确立了。了解培根叛乱很重要，但不要歪曲事实，也不要过度简化。是的，它导致了奴隶制机构的发展，但可悲的是，早在培根叛乱之前，奴隶制就是殖民地生活的一个事实。

“法国-印第安战争是法国人和美洲原住民之间的战争。”事实是——这场战争是法国及其美洲原住民盟友对抗英国人、殖民者（有点）以及他们极少数的土著盟友的战争。殖民者不情愿战斗。所以记住，在这场战争期间，大多数土著人都站在法国一边。

“法国-印第安战争结束后不久，许多殖民者就想脱离英国独立。”这是错误的。事实——在1763年至1776年之间，存在着一个缓慢走向独立的运动。每个人都听说过法国-印第安战争、税收和独立，但历史并非如此简单。是的，战争之后出现了税收，母国和殖民地之间的关系变得紧张，但要走到美国独立战争，还需要发生很多事情——你们可以在那里看到它们。我的意思是，1775年在列克星敦和康科德响起了枪声，但他们仍然在试图解决问题。

另一个错误——“美国独立战争主要是因为税收而打的。”事实是，殖民者受到启蒙思想、对自治的渴望以及对英国新的帝国主义努力的抵抗的激励。是的，很少有人喜欢税收，一些殖民者把茶叶倒进了海港，殖民者还有一些很棒的口号，比如“无代表，不纳税”。但思想和自然权利、想要更多的自治和自治政府，以及对英国结束有益的忽视、征税和执行现有法律的抵抗都发挥了作用。不仅仅是税收。

我看到很多人说“殖民地里的每个人都想脱离英国独立。”事实是——殖民地社会分裂为效忠派、爱国者和那些不放弃的人。你们知道吗？你们知道在《独立宣言》之后，每个人都在吃热狗、燃放烟花庆祝自由的感觉很好，但现实要复杂得多。

常犯的错误——“邦联条例彻底失败了。”事实——邦联条例在美国独立战争期间确实统治了这个国家，并创建了西北法令。听着，我通常是一个悲观主义者——负面先生——但我们需要肯定邦联条例的功劳。是的，它不能征税，非常软弱，但它确实做了一些好事。

“五分之三妥协方案给了奴隶五分之三的投票权。这对黑人来说是件好事。”事实——五分之三妥协方案涉及在众议院中如何计算奴隶以进行国会代表权的分配。不。任何时候你用分数来谈论人类，这可能都不是一件好事。但我看到很多学生说五分之三给了非裔美国人五分之三的权利。不。不。不。基本上，南方希望他们的奴隶被计算在内，不是因为他们想扩大奴隶的权利，而是因为你的人越多，你得到的代表就越多。所以在制宪会议上，我们妥协了我们的价值观，说让我们把每个奴隶都算作五分之三的人，这样北方和南方都可以对这部新宪法感到满意。

“联邦党人和反联邦党人是政党。”不。第一个两党制是1790年代的联邦党人和民主共和党人。反联邦党人和联邦党人代表了关于批准宪法的辩论的两个方面。联邦党人是宪法团队的，而反联邦党人则说“不，不批准宪法”。所以第一个两党制直到1790年代才出现，当时关于汉密尔顿计划和其他问题的辩论导致了政党的崛起。是的，其中一个是联邦党，是的，许多反联邦党人将是民主共和党人，但反联邦党人不是一个政党。

我不知道有多少次我看到学生问“什么是战前时期？”它只是用来描述内战前时期的术语。学生们总是对此感到困惑。所以基本上它是大约1820年代开始，没有正式开始日期，一直到内战的时期。

很多学生不了解第二个两党制。这基本上是辉格党和民主党之间的斗争，你最好了解它。这是辉格党和民主党之间的全部内容，基本上辉格党因为银行和一大堆其他问题而与安德鲁·杰克逊闹翻了。所以第一个两党制——联邦党人对抗民主共和党人。这是1830-40年代的第二个两党制。

我看到不少学生说美墨战争和美西战争是同一回事。事实是，美墨战争发生在1846年至1847年。美西战争发生在1898年。如果你认为它们是同一回事，你可能是种族主义者，或者希望只是糊涂了。西班牙和墨西哥是不同的地方。美墨战争是我们夺取了墨西哥一半领土，并再次引发了关于这些领土上奴隶制的问题的战争。而美西战争是我们夺取了西班牙的一堆殖民地，并引发了关于美国在世界上的角色的辩论。它们是不同的。

下一个有点棘手。不是“性主义增加，南方成功了。”而是“地区主义增加，南方分裂了。”这是有区别的。

这可能是最流行的说法——“北方反对奴隶制。”事实是，即使在内战前夕，废奴运动在北方也不是多数运动。如果事情如此简单——北方自由，南方奴隶——那就好了，但事实并非如此。是的，1840年代和50年代，许多北方人开始反对在领土上扩张奴隶制。许多人不喜欢1850年的《逃亡奴隶法》。但实际的废除奴隶制并不受欢迎。话虽如此，这就是为什么这些人因为他们所做和所反对的事情而更加厉害的原因。

这是另一个常见的错误——“《解放奴隶宣言》解放了所有奴隶，而林肯是废奴主义者。”事实是，林肯的主要目标是维护联邦，而《解放奴隶宣言》是作为一项战时措施通过的，只解放了叛乱地区的奴隶。这是另一个被过度简化的问题，可以对此进行非常详细的讨论，因为你知道什么——林肯个人和政治上的真实信念是什么？但基本情况是——要知道林肯在1860年当选时并没有试图在所有地方结束奴隶制。这是一个自由土地的立场，《解放奴隶宣言》只适用于南方邦联，因为林肯不想激怒那些也拥有奴隶但仍然忠于联邦的边境州。

“塞内卡瀑布会议直接导致了第十九修正案。”事实是——1848年和1920年是不同的年份。是的，在塞内卡瀑布，一群妇女和少数男人要求选举权和其他权利，这通常被视为妇女选举权运动的开始。但这次会议发生在1848年，之后发生了很多事情——既有挫折也有争取第十九修正案的步骤。当第十五修正案通过时，妇女的选举权被搁置了。妇女在许多进步改革中发挥了重要作用。第一次世界大战的影响，等等等等。所以不要在你的思考中做出如此巨大的飞跃，跳过历史发展。历史往往是一场斗争，所以结果往往不是立竿见影的。

说到选举权，很多学生喜欢说“妇女选举权运动为所有妇女的权利而奋斗。”事实更复杂。妇女选举权运动在策略以及是否应该将非裔美国妇女或一般的有色人种妇女纳入选举权方面存在分歧。如果争取选举权的运动是为所有妇女而奋斗，那就太好了，但可悲的是，事实并非如此。妇女选举权运动是一个跨越数十年的广泛术语，不仅在策略上存在分歧——我们应该争取宪法修正案（致敬爱丽丝·保罗）还是逐州争取（凯瑞·查普曼·卡特）——而且许多妇女公开反对将非裔美国妇女纳入投票权。这就是为什么当艾达·B·威尔斯-巴内特开始游行时，在右边那张照片里，这是一件大事。

“第十五修正案保障了非裔美国男性公民的投票权。”事实是——在重建时期结束后，南方各州通过了考试、人头税、财产要求、祖父条款和直接暴力来剥夺黑人选民的选举权。我们都知道童话般的版本——内战后，奴隶获得了自由。《第十三条修正案》和《第十四条修正案》使一切变得美好，提供了一堆权利。是的，《第十五条修正案》确实保障了不分种族的投票权。但修正案的效力取决于它的执行和维护它的意愿。在放弃重建之后，南方大多数非裔美国人的投票权也被放弃了。

这个视频就到这里了。希望这能消除你们可能存在的一些误解，并防止你们在考试中犯这些错误。记住，在历史和APUSH中成功的关键是批判性思维。[https://www.google.com/search?q=%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%9A%84%E7%BD%91%E7%AB%99APUSHExplained.com上有各种各样的视频回顾美国历史](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%9A%84%E7%BD%91%E7%AB%99APUSHExplained.com 上有各种各样的视频回顾美国历史)。如果这个视频对你有帮助，请点赞，留下评论，告诉你的所有朋友关于我们免费的APUSH和AP政府资源，祝你度过美好的一天。再见！

Hello, beautiful people. In this video, I'm going to review 20-ish mistakes students in US history APUSH and most folks make about American history. For you APUSH students, these are things you're gonna want to avoid saying on any APUSH exam because if you do, your teacher and America will cry.
