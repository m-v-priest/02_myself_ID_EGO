== 释义

All right, we're back APUSH people, trying to help you score a five on that exam （在考试中得五分）. + 
 Today we are taking a look at the trans-Mississippi West 密西西比河以西地区 and what was going down （俚语：发生了什么）with farmers from the period 1865 to 1896. + 
 If you're using any APUSH book, this video will help you out （帮助你；对你有帮助）. + 
 There's how it lines up with （与……相符；与……一致）those three books right there. + 


Now in other videos we've already seen people moving out west, but in this video we're taking a look at largely the settlement 定居 of the Great Plains region 大平原地区. + 
 And really important point to keep in mind is the federal government 联邦政府 is going to actively promote 积极推动 economic development and the movement west. + 
 What does that mean? Well, if you recall during the Civil War we had something called the Homestead Act 宅地法 passed by Congress in 1862. + 
 And the Homestead Act offered public land up to 160 acres 英亩 to any person who lived on the land and improved it for a period of 5 years, and you could get your title 所有权 to the land. + 


Now this was intended to encourage settlement of the west, but there are difficulties and limitations to the Homestead Act. + 
 It was an enormous opportunity, but very often the quality of land that was available was rather poor. + 
 There's a high cost of supplies 物资费用高 -- you have to buy the equipment even though the land is relatively cheap if not free. + 
 You have to buy all the farming equipment 农业设备. + 
 Mother Nature 大自然 -- from droughts 干旱 to too cold, too hot, everything in between. + 
 There's a lot of fraud 欺诈行为 where very often it would be speculators 投机者 getting the best land out in the west. + 
 And crop prices fluctuated 波动, which left farmers in a very difficult situation 处境艰难. + 


There also was another example of the government helping western settlement, and that is also during the Civil War with the Pacific Railroad Act 太平洋铁路法案 in 1862. + 
 And it authorized 授权 the building of the transcontinental railroad 横贯大陆的铁路 along a northern route 路线. + 
 And the federal government is going to help this process because they're going to provide money and land subsidies 补贴 to the railroad companies to construct this project. + 
 And of course in 1869 it will be completed, transforming life in the west forever. + 


So what are people doing out in the west? What was the economy like? And it's really important you understand that there was a boom and bust cycle 兴衰周期 to this economy -- enormous profits 巨额利润 followed by huge economic collapse 经济崩溃. + 
 Very often you see this in the mining industry 采矿业. + 
 There's a whole bunch of mining booms 矿业繁荣 you can see them on the map. + 
 You know California Gold Rush 加利福尼亚淘金热 is the most famous one, but you have in 1858 gold being discovered at Pikes Peak in Colorado. + 
 The famous Comstock Lode 康斯托克矿脉 in 1859 in Nevada, and that leads to Nevada entering the Union 加入联邦 as a state relatively quickly. + 


And these conditions in the mines were very, very difficult. + 
 It's extremely dangerous. + 
 A lot of people are coming in. + 
 You know overnight these towns would emerge 出现 with nearly half of the people living in these towns being foreign born 外国出生的. + 
 We got people from Latin America, from Asia, from Europe and from the United States in these mining towns. + 
 So they're like this melting pot 大熔炉 of people. + 
 One-third of the people in the mining towns on the west coast were Chinese immigrants. + 
 And the mining industry is going to have a huge impact especially with the environment. + 
 Hydraulic mining 水力采矿 where they're using high-pressure equipment 高压设备 to try to access the material, the minerals 矿物质, is going to devastate 破坏 the environment. + 
 And of course when more and more people come out, you're going to have conflict with native people 原住民 which will lead to the loss of Native American land 美洲原住民土地. + 


Another important industry in the west is the cattle industry 畜牧业. + 
 And really you got to keep in mind that the Spanish and then the Mexican cowboys -- the vaqueros （西班牙语：牧牛人）-- had been doing this for a very long time before Texas was a part of the United States. + 
 And the concept is simple, right? You take these cattle 牛 and you transport them along this vast open grass 广阔的草原 -- basically they get to eat for free. + 
 And the American cattle industry starts to grow. + 
 And the railroad really opens up new markets 开拓新市场 as you saw the cows go up to the north to cities such as Dodge City or Abilene, Kansas. + 
 And you transport those cows to eastern markets 东部市场. + 
 And once again just like the mining industry -- boom and bust cycle because very often you would have things like bad winters where it would be really cold and the cows would die. + 
 Prices would drop. + 
 Overgrazing 过度放牧 where the grass would run out 耗尽. + 
 Farmers are eventually going to put up barbed wire fencing 带刺铁丝网 which is going to cause all sorts of problems between the farmers and the cattlemen 牧民. + 
 And as a result you have the boom and bust continuing. + 


That you need to keep in mind when we're talking about the west is the myth 神话 versus 与……相比 the reality 现实. + 
 There's a very romanticized view 浪漫化的看法 of the American West, and you could see that in literature, paintings, and of course the famous dime novels 廉价小说. + 
 And very often in these dime novels you have these cowboys roaming the frontier 边疆 -- all romantic view of these brave, honorable men 勇敢、可敬的人. + 
 Often times they ignore the complexity 复杂性 of Native American life and the reality of life in the west as very difficult, lonely and challenging 艰难、孤独且具有挑战性. + 


One of the things about the west that's really unique is the melting pot nature 大熔炉性质 of the American West. + 
 Like we've already said, you have huge amounts of Chinese immigrants coming in. + 
 So you have a vibrant 充满活力的 Chinese community. + 
 They are going to be of course with the California Gold Rush. + 
 Great photo -- you see all these different groups together trying to strike it rich （俚语：发财；暴富）. + 
 And then of course with the building of the railroad, the Chinese labor 劳动力 is going to be an important part of that. + 
 And of course with that Chinese immigration comes a rise of nativism 本土主义 that you should know about with the Chinese Exclusion Act 排华法案 eventually being passed. + 


And a lot of the cowboys out in the west were in fact African-American or Mexican. + 
 The original cowboys were Mexican vaqueros. + 
 The importance of religion in the west is important. + 
 A lot of different groups came out west. + 
 We saw the Mormons 摩门教徒 go west as a result of the discrimination 歧视 they faced. + 
 And in 1896, Utah enters the Union as a state after the church formally drops the practice of polygamy 一夫多妻制. + 
 And women's suffrage 妇女选举权 also kind of shows you the complexity of the west. + 
 It was much more common out in the west for women to have the right to vote 选举权. + 
 In fact, Wyoming is the first state to grant 赋予 women the right to vote, followed by other states out in the west such as Utah. + 
 And the reality is that is a way to encourage women to come out west and also to honor the fact that they are playing an important role on these homesteads 农庄 in these communities in the west. + 


Now life in the trans-Mississippi west of course you really got to talk about the native people that are there. + 
 And we're going to focus on the Plains Indians 平原印第安人 out west. + 
 And there's a whole variety of people -- the Sioux 苏族, the Blackfoot 黑脚族, the Crow 克劳族, the Comanche 科曼奇族 -- who make up this area in the light blue. + 
 And there's a variety of environmental factors 环境因素, but really what is common with these groups is the heavy reliance on 高度依赖 the hunting of bison 野牛. + 
 And these Native Americans' lives have already changed even before this time period because the European introduction of the horse. + 
 It transforms mobility 机动性 on the Great Plains, increases warfare 战争 between tribes 部落, but it allows them to hunt the buffalo in new ways. + 
 The introduction of firearms 火器, alcohol and disease all have already had impacts on the Plains Indians. + 


And as people are moving west as a result of these overland routes 陆路路线, these transcontinental railroads, these mining booms, you're going to have increasing pressure on Native American life. + 
 And this expansion 扩张 of the United States is going to lead to conflict with native people. + 
 There's going to be a severe decline 急剧下降 in the population of the bison. + 
 You could see that on that graphic 图表 right there. + 
 And there's a variety of reasons for this. + 
 One, there was an attempt to undermine Native American resistance 抵抗 by killing the bison. + 
 There's a demand for buffalo hides 兽皮 out in the east. + 
 There's the impact of the railroad expansion -- as you build the railroads you want to get rid of 摆脱 the buffalo so they don't get in the way of 妨碍 its operation. + 
 And as a result of this expansion out west into native land, the biggest impact of western expansion will take place upon the lives of Native Americans in the trans-Mississippi west. + 
 Really important you know that. + 
 And that is going to lead to horrible conflict that is known as the Indian Wars 印第安战争. + 


And there's a whole variety of examples that we can give you. + 
 We're going to focus on a few, but you can see on those red stars different places, different conflicts. + 
 Violence occurs as the homesteaders 自耕农, miners and ranchers 牧场主 move west into native land. + 
 Sand Creek is a sad example of what this violence looked like. + 
 In 1864, the Colorado militia 民兵 attacks and kills over 100 native people in Colorado -- many of them women and children. + 
 Battle of Little Bighorn takes place in 1876 where the Sioux tribe inspired by their leader and others -- Sitting Bull 坐牛 for example -- kills Custer, US Army officer, and his men in the seventh Cavalry 第七骑兵团. + 
 This becomes known as Custer's Last Stand 卡斯特的最后抵抗, and about 264 members of the regiment 团 were killed by the Sioux Indians. + 
 However, that victory will be short-lived 短暂的 because the US Army will respond with force 武力回应. + 


And another example is with Chief Joseph who tries to lead members of the Nez Perce tribe 内兹珀斯部落 into Canada along the route you see on the map. + 
 And eventually he and his tribal members are captured by the US government and he surrenders 投降 in 1877. + 
 And the big one that you should definitely know about is the Battle of Wounded Knee 伤膝河战役. + 
 And what happens there is a Ghost Dance Movement 鬼舞运动 develops amongst the Sioux Indians in Dakota territory 达科他地区. + 
 And many of the Sioux Indians believe that this Ghost Dance would bring a revival 复兴 -- it was a cultural and religious revival for the tribal members 部落成员. + 
 And they thought that this would return their tribe to greatness and also lead to white settlers 白人定居者 to leave. + 
 And the government of the United States wants to stop this because settlers are coming into Sioux territory, and they want these native people to be confined to 被限制在 their reservations 保留地. + 


And of course the moment of tragedy happens in 1890 at the Battle of Wounded Knee where the US Army goes into the Dakotas and kills over 200 native people -- many again women and children. + 
 This battle really -- it's almost unfair to call it a battle -- it's really a massacre 大屠杀. + 
 You could see one of the bodies laying in the frozen aftermath 冰冻的废墟中. + 
 And it marks the Battle of Wounded Knee -- important you know -- marks the end of the major Native American frontier wars 美洲原住民边疆战争. + 
 It's kind of like the final big war. + 
 And historians have documented at this great book Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown taking a look at the Native American perspective 视角 of expansion. + 


And there were attempts at assimilation 同化. + 
 In fact, some people began to question the US government's treatment of the native people. + 
 That beautiful woman right there, Helen Hunt Jackson, wrote a book in 1881 called A Century of Dishonor 一个世纪的耻辱 in which she documents 记录 the mistreatment 虐待 by the federal government of native people. + 
 Some people advocated that boarding schools 寄宿学校 such as Carlisle Indian School -- they would eliminate 消除 their native culture 本土文化 and become assimilated into American society 融入美国社会. + 
 And others supporters of this kind of approach of assimilation as the answer supported the Dawes Severalty Act 道斯法案 in 1887. + 
 And this was intended to end tribal ownership of land 部落土地所有权. + 
 And what it did was basically reservations would be split up into 160 acre private farms 私人农场. + 
 Native Americans had to adopt this kind of private property approach 私有财产方式, and they had the potential to receive citizenship 公民身份 if they lived on the land for 25 years and adopted the habits of civilized life 文明生活习惯. + 
 So they're supposed to promote Christianity 基督教, job training 职业培训, separate their culture -- was the solution some felt. + 
 And the remaining land was very often sold to white settlers -- often times this was the best land. + 
 And it was a massive failure 巨大失败. + 
 The Dawes Act was a massive failure for Native Americans. + 
 And through war and through other means, the population of native people in the Great Plains region dramatically drops. + 
 And you could see the land shrinkage 土地减少 right there. + 


And in 1890s there's this idea that the frontier 边疆 has closed. + 
 And kind of the last big land rush 土地抢购 takes place in Oklahoma territory 俄克拉何马地区. + 
 If you recall, that's where Andrew Jackson during the Trail of Tears 血泪之路 -- the Indian Removal Act 印第安人迁移法案 -- had put the native people in Oklahoma, what is called Indian Territory 印第安领地. + 
 And they open up settlement in 1889, and there's a huge land rush where suddenly now the native people are being forced to relocate 重新安置 again. + 
 And a famous historian -- make sure you know about him -- Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 writes The Significance of the Frontier in American History 边疆在美国历史上的重要性. + 
 And he basically argues that in the 1890s he uses the census data 人口普查数据 from the US Census that the frontier has closed. + 
 And really he talks about in his work the importance of the frontier on American identity 美国身份认同. + 
 It made America independent, individualistic 个人主义的, and it was this place that had opportunity for people. + 
 And it's this idea of the safety valve theory 安全阀理论 -- that you could always head west when the times were tough 困难时期. + 
 You can leave and go west and start over 重新开始 and start a new. + 


Of course historians have since kind of criticized Jackson Turner's interpretation 解释 because it does ignore the contributions of the people that are already there -- women -- and the fact that in reality by 1890s most people were not heading west. + 
 They were in fact moving to urban cities looking for industrial jobs 工业工作. + 
 So the Frontier Thesis 边疆理论 though is extremely important in American history and American identity -- the idea of the frontier. + 
 An important concept to kind of keep in mind for a later APUSH material is in the 1890s though you are going to see this emphasis on overseas expansion 海外扩张 in places like Cuba and the Philippines. + 
 So one frontier closes, a new one is open really quickly. + 


We're going to run down 简要说明 what farmers were up to at this time. + 
 Farming was becoming more commercialized 商业化 and specialized 专业化. + 
 Farmers were focusing on single cash crops 经济作物 like wheat or corn. + 
 And life was difficult for farmers. + 
 They were susceptible to 易受……影响 falling prices -- if you made too much your crop price went down. + 
 Unfair railroad business practices 不公平的铁路商业行为 especially from shippers 托运人. + 
 The high cost of machinery 机械费用高 -- you had to pay a lot of money to buy this new equipment. + 
 And very often you went in deep debt 深陷债务 that you had difficulty paying off 偿还. + 
 The tight money supply 货币供应紧张 -- they wanted more money in circulation 流通. + 
 They did not want gold as the answer. + 
 And of course high tariffs 高关税 which were supported by Republican administrations 共和党政府. + 


And so these problems lead farmers to organize 组织起来. + 
 And one of the first national movements amongst farmers is the Grange Movement 格兰其运动 by Oliver Kelley. + 
 And really they organize social and educational activities for farmers, but later on they're going to demand collective reforms 集体改革. + 
 They want government regulation 政府监管 and ownership of businesses 企业所有权. + 
 They don't want these railroads to have this huge amount of power that they had. + 
 And they start lobbying 游说 state legislators 州立法者 for reforms. + 
 And they get some laws passed. + 
 And the courts uphold 支持 those laws -- Munn versus Illinois. + 
 Basically the court rules and upholds one of the Granger laws 格兰其法 by saying the states could regulate the railroad industry. + 
 That is overturned in the Wabash case 沃巴什案 where the court reverses 推翻判决 and says states cannot regulate interstate commerce 州际贸易. + 
 And of course that will lead later on to the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act 州际商业法. + 


Another farmers movement you should be aware of is the Farmers' Alliance 农民联盟. + 
 They're founded in Texas in the 1870s. + 
 They're going to have problems because basically farmers were divided amongst themselves 内部分裂. + 
 They excluded African-Americans. + 
 In fact there is the Colored Farmers' Alliance 有色人种农民联盟 that is formed. + 
 They ignore tenant farmers 佃农 -- farmers that do not own the land. + 
 But both the Farmers' Alliance and the Grange movement will eventually kind of lead to this new political party -- a significant third party 重要的第三党 called the Populist Party 人民党. + 
 And they have a platform 政纲. + 
 They're going to run candidates such as James Weaver for president in 1892. + 
 They want government ownership of the railroads. + 
 They want the free and unlimited coinage of silver 自由无限制地铸造银币. + 
 They want to increase the money supply. + 
 They want a graduated income tax 累进所得税 where the rich people pay more. + 
 And they want to reform politics by having a direct election of senators 直接选举参议员. + 


And they want to use political reforms such as the initiative 创制权 and the referendum 公投. + 
 So farmers are starting to organize in response to this changing nature of the economy. + 


And then let's close out 结束 the 19th century really quickly here. + 
 There's a growing frustration 越来越多的不满 -- a big idea over the laissez-faire capitalist system 自由放任资本主义制度. + 
 We saw how the farmers are dealing with it with the Grange movement, the alliance movement and the Populist political party. + 
 But you also have industrial problems. + 
 In 1892 there's the Homestead Strike 霍姆斯特德罢工 where workers at Carnegie Steel 卡内基钢铁公司 are defeated by Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie. + 
 There's a panic of 1893 1893年经济恐慌 where basically as a result of over-speculation 过度投机 the stock market crashes 股市崩盘. + 
 This causes huge economic problems. + 
 Unemployment goes up 失业率上升. + 
 And the president at the time, Grover Cleveland, continues his laissez-faire approach 自由放任政策. + 
 He's not going to get involved 介入. + 


There is a demand for the government to do something. + 
 Coxey's Army 考克斯军 marches on Washington D. + 
C. + 
 -- it was unemployed men who marched to D. + 
C. + 
 demanding that the federal government hire the jobless, the unemployed, to do public works jobs 公共工程项目. + 
 And those people -- Coxey himself and his followers -- are arrested for trespassing 非法侵入. + 
 And the government ignores the plight 困境 of the workers. + 
 In fact, the government once again steps in on behalf of business 在商业利益一方介入 during the Pullman Strike 普尔曼罢工 in 1894. + 
 President Cleveland uses the army and a court injunction 法院禁令 to defeat the strike led by Eugene Debs 尤金·德布斯 in the American Railway Union 美国铁路工会. + 


And as you're going to see in the election of 1896, you're going to have the Republican William McKinley 共和党人威廉·麦金利 running against a young whipper-snapper （俚语：傲慢的年轻人）William Jennings Bryan. + 
 He's going to deliver his Cross of Gold speech 黄金十字架演讲 where he calls for the free and unlimited coinage of silver. + 
 The Democratic party 民主党 takes some of the Populist ideas 人民党理念, and in the election the Republican William McKinley wins. + 
 The Populist party kind of fades away 逐渐消失. + 
 And we will check out 查看 what happens under President McKinley in another video. + 


If you have any questions you can post a comment. + 
 If you haven't done so, subscribe 订阅 and tell all your classmates to do the same so we can get that five on this APUSH exam. + 
 And thank you for watching. + 
 Have a beautiful day, a beautiful night. + 
 Peace. +

好的，各位APUSH的同学们，我们又回来了，努力帮助你们在考试中拿到五分。今天我们要探讨密西西比河以西地区以及1865年至1896年间农民的状况。如果你正在使用任何APUSH教材，这段视频都会对你有所帮助。这里列出了它与那三本书的对应关系。

在其他视频中，我们已经看到人们向西部迁移，但在这个视频中，我们主要关注大平原地区的定居。需要记住的一个非常重要的点是，联邦政府将积极促进经济发展和向西部的迁移。这是什么意思呢？如果你还记得，在内战期间，国会在1862年通过了一项叫做《宅地法》的法案。《宅地法》向任何在土地上居住并改良土地五年的人提供最多160英亩的公共土地，之后你就可以获得土地的所有权。

这项法案旨在鼓励西部地区的定居，但《宅地法》也存在困难和局限性。这是一个巨大的机会，但很多时候，可用的土地质量相当差。物资成本很高——即使土地相对便宜甚至免费，你也必须购买设备。你必须购买所有的农具。大自然——从干旱到过冷、过热，各种极端天气都有。存在大量的欺诈行为，投机者经常获得西部最好的土地。农作物价格波动不定，这使得农民处于非常困难的境地。

政府帮助西部定居的另一个例子是同样在内战期间通过的1862年《太平洋铁路法案》。它授权修建一条沿北部路线的横贯大陆铁路。联邦政府将帮助这个过程，因为它将向铁路公司提供资金和土地补贴来建设这个项目。当然，它将在1869年完工，永远改变西部的生活。

那么西部的人们在做什么呢？那里的经济是怎样的？理解这个经济存在繁荣与萧条的周期非常重要——巨大的利润之后是巨大的经济崩溃。这种情况在采矿业中非常常见。你们可以在地图上看到许多矿业繁荣时期。你们知道加州淘金热是最著名的，但在1858年，科罗拉多州的派克斯峰发现了黄金。1859年内华达州发现了著名的康斯托克矿脉，这使得内华达州相对较快地加入联邦成为一个州。

矿井里的条件非常非常艰苦。极其危险。很多人涌入。你们知道，一夜之间这些城镇就会出现，镇上近一半的人是外国出生的。在这些矿业城镇里，我们有来自拉丁美洲、亚洲、欧洲和美国的人。所以它们就像一个民族的大熔炉。西海岸矿业城镇的三分之一的人是中国移民。采矿业将产生巨大的影响，尤其是在环境方面。水力采矿，他们使用高压设备来获取矿物，将破坏环境。当然，当越来越多的人涌入时，你们将与当地居民发生冲突，这将导致美洲原住民土地的丧失。

西部另一个重要的产业是畜牧业。你们需要记住，在德克萨斯成为美国一部分之前，西班牙人和后来的墨西哥牛仔——牛仔（vaqueros）——已经做了很长时间了。概念很简单，对吧？你把这些牛赶到广阔的开阔草地上——基本上它们可以免费吃草。美国的畜牧业开始发展。正如你们所见，铁路真正开辟了新的市场，牛群被赶到北方，到达像堪萨斯州的道奇城或阿比林这样的城市。然后你们再把这些牛运往东部市场。再一次，就像采矿业一样——繁荣与萧条的周期，因为很多时候你们会遇到像寒冷的冬天这样的情况，天气非常寒冷，牛会死亡。价格会下跌。过度放牧导致草地枯竭。农民最终会竖起带刺的铁丝网，这将导致农民和牧场主之间产生各种各样的问题。结果，繁荣与萧条的周期持续存在。

当我们在谈论西部时，你们需要记住的是神话与现实。人们对美国西部有一种非常浪漫的看法，你们可以在文学、绘画，当然还有著名的一角小说中看到这一点。在这些一角小说中，牛仔们经常在边疆漫游——对这些勇敢、正直的男人充满了浪漫的想象。他们常常忽视美洲原住民生活的复杂性，以及西部生活非常艰难、孤独和充满挑战的现实。

关于西部，真正独特的一点是美国西部的民族大熔炉性质。正如我们已经说过的，大量的中国移民涌入。所以你们看到了一个充满活力的华人社区。他们当然是随着加州淘金热而来的。很棒的照片——你们看到所有不同的群体聚集在一起，试图发财致富。然后当然，随着铁路的建设，中国劳工将成为其中的重要组成部分。当然，随着中国移民的到来，也出现了你们应该了解的本土主义的兴起，最终导致了《排华法案》的通过。

西部许多牛仔实际上是非裔美国人或墨西哥人。最初的牛仔是墨西哥牛仔（vaqueros）。宗教在西部的重要性也很重要。许多不同的群体来到西部。我们看到摩门教徒因为他们遭受的歧视而向西迁移。1896年，在教会正式放弃一夫多妻制之后，犹他州加入了联邦成为一个州。妇女选举权也在某种程度上显示了西部的复杂性。在西部，女性拥有投票权更为普遍。事实上，怀俄明州是第一个赋予女性投票权的州，其次是西部其他州，如犹他州。现实情况是，这是一种鼓励女性来到西部的方式，也是为了尊重她们在西部这些家园和社区中发挥的重要作用。

当然，在密西西比河以西的生活，你们真的必须谈论那里的原住民。我们将重点关注西部的平原印第安人。那里有各种各样的人——苏族、黑脚族、克罗族、科曼奇族——他们构成了浅蓝色区域。存在各种各样的环境因素，但这些群体共同的特点是对野牛狩猎的严重依赖。甚至在这个时期之前，这些美洲原住民的生活就已经发生了变化，因为欧洲人引进了马匹。它改变了大平原的交通方式，增加了部落之间的战争，但也使他们能够以新的方式猎杀野牛。枪支、酒精和疾病的引入都对平原印第安人产生了影响。

随着人们因陆路、横贯大陆铁路和淘金热而向西迁移，美洲原住民的生活将面临越来越大的压力。美国的扩张将导致与原住民的冲突。野牛的数量将急剧下降。你们可以在那张图上看到这一点。这有很多原因。一是试图通过杀死野牛来削弱美洲原住民的抵抗。东部对野牛皮的需求很大。还有铁路扩张的影响——修建铁路时，你们想要清除野牛，以免它们妨碍铁路的运营。由于向西部原住民土地的扩张，西部扩张对密西西比河以西的美洲原住民的生活产生了最大的影响。这一点非常重要，你们要了解。这将导致被称为印第安战争的可怕冲突。

我们可以给你们很多例子。我们将重点介绍几个，但你们可以在那些红星上看到不同的地点，不同的冲突。当定居者、矿工和牧场主向西迁移到原住民土地时，暴力事件就发生了。“沙溪大屠杀”是这种暴力事件的一个悲惨例子。1864年，科罗拉多州民兵袭击并杀害了科罗拉多州100多名原住民——其中许多是妇女和儿童。1876年发生了“小巨角战役”，苏族部落在他们的领导人和其他人（例如坐牛）的鼓舞下，杀死了卡斯特（美国陆军军官）及其第七骑兵团的士兵。这被称为卡斯特的最后抵抗，大约264名骑兵团成员被苏族印第安人杀死。然而，这场胜利是短暂的，因为美国陆军将以武力回应。

另一个例子是约瑟夫酋长，他试图带领内兹珀斯部落的成员沿着你们在地图上看到的路线进入加拿大。最终，他和他的部落成员被美国政府俘虏，他于1877年投降。你们绝对应该了解的一场大战是“伤膝河大屠杀”。那里发生的事情是，在达科他地区的苏族印第安人中兴起了一场“鬼舞运动”。许多苏族印第安人相信，这种鬼舞会带来复兴——这是部落成员的文化和宗教复兴。他们认为这将使他们的部落恢复伟大，并导致白人定居者离开。美国政府想要阻止这一点，因为定居者正在进入苏族领地，他们希望这些原住民被限制在他们的保留地内。

当然，悲剧的时刻发生在1890年的“伤膝河大屠杀”，美国陆军进入达科他地区，杀害了200多名原住民——其中许多又是妇女和儿童。这场“战斗”——称其为战斗几乎是不公平的——实际上是一场屠杀。你们可以看到其中一具尸体躺在冰冷的残骸中。“伤膝河大屠杀”标志着——重要的是你们要了解——标志着主要的美国原住民边疆战争的结束。这有点像最后一场大战。历史学家在迪·布朗的伟大著作《埋葬我的心在伤膝河》中记录了从美洲原住民的角度看待扩张。

当时存在着同化的企图。事实上，有些人开始质疑美国政府对待原住民的方式。那位美丽的女士，海伦·亨特·杰克逊，在1881年写了一本书，名为《世纪的耻辱》，她在书中记录了联邦政府对原住民的虐待。有些人主张寄宿学校，例如卡莱尔印第安学校——他们将消除原住民文化，并融入美国社会。而另一些支持这种同化方式的人则支持1887年的《道斯法案》。该法案旨在结束部落对土地的所有权。它基本上将保留地划分为160英亩的私人农场。美洲原住民必须采用这种私有财产的方式，如果他们在土地上居住25年并采纳文明的生活习惯，他们就有可能获得公民身份。因此，他们应该促进基督教、职业培训，分离他们的文化——这是有些人认为的解决方案。而剩余的土地通常被卖给白人定居者——通常这是最好的土地。这是一个巨大的失败。《道斯法案》对美洲原住民来说是一个巨大的失败。通过战争和其他手段，大平原地区原住民的人口急剧下降。你们可以在那里看到土地的缩减。

在1890年代，有一种边疆已经关闭的说法。最后一次大规模的土地争夺发生在俄克拉荷马领地。如果你们还记得，那是安德鲁·杰克逊在“血泪之路”——《印第安人迁移法案》期间——将原住民安置在俄克拉荷马州的地方，即所谓的印第安领地。他们在1889年开放定居，爆发了大规模的土地争夺，原住民突然再次被迫迁移。一位著名的历史学家——务必了解他——弗雷德里克·杰克逊·特纳在1893年写了《边疆在美国历史上的意义》。他基本上认为，在1890年代，他使用美国人口普查的数据表明边疆已经关闭。实际上，他在他的著作中谈到了边疆对美国身份的重要性。它使美国独立、个人主义，并且是人们拥有机会的地方。这就是安全阀理论——当生活艰难时，你总是可以向西迁移。你可以离开，去西部重新开始，开创新的生活。

当然，历史学家后来批评了杰克逊·特纳的解释，因为它忽视了已经居住在那里的人们——妇女——的贡献，以及到1890年代大多数人实际上并没有向西迁移的事实。他们实际上是搬到城市寻找工业工作。然而，《边疆论》在美国历史和美国身份——边疆的概念——中极其重要。一个在以后的APUSH学习中需要记住的重要概念是，在1890年代，你们将看到对古巴和菲律宾等地的海外扩张的强调。所以一个边疆关闭了，一个新的边疆很快就打开了。

我们将快速回顾一下当时农民的状况。农业变得更加商业化和专业化。农民专注于单一的经济作物，如小麦或玉米。农民的生活很艰难。他们容易受到价格下跌的影响——如果产量过高，农作物价格就会下跌。来自托运人的不公平铁路商业行为。高昂的机械成本——你必须花很多钱购买这些新设备。而且你经常负债累累，难以偿还。货币供应紧张——他们想要更多的货币流通。他们不想要黄金作为唯一的答案。当然还有共和党政府支持的高关税。

因此，这些问题导致农民组织起来。农民中最早的全国性运动之一是奥利弗·凯利的“谷物协会运动”。实际上，他们为农民组织社会和教育活动，但后来他们将要求集体改革。他们想要政府监管和所有权的企业。他们不希望这些铁路公司拥有如此巨大的权力。他们开始游说州议员进行改革。他们通过了一些法律。法院维持了这些法律——“芒诉伊利诺伊州案”。基本上，法院裁定并维持了一项“谷物法”，认为各州可以监管铁路行业。但这在“沃巴什案”中被推翻，法院推翻了先前的裁决，认为各州不能监管州际贸易。当然，这将导致后来《州际商务法》的通过。

你们应该了解的另一个农民运动是农民联盟。他们于1870年代在德克萨斯州成立。他们会遇到问题，因为基本上农民之间存在分歧。他们排除了非裔美国人。事实上，成立了有色人种农民联盟。他们忽视了佃农——那些不拥有土地的农民。但农民联盟和谷物协会运动最终都将导致一个新的政党——一个重要的第三党，称为人民党。他们有一个政治纲领。他们将在1892年推举詹姆斯·韦弗为总统候选人。他们想要政府拥有铁路。他们想要自由和无限的白银铸币。他们想要增加货币供应。他们想要累进所得税，富人支付更多。他们想要通过直接选举参议员来改革政治。他们想要使用像倡议和公民投票这样的政治改革措施。因此，农民开始组织起来应对这种不断变化的经济形势。

然后，让我们在这里快速结束19世纪。人们对自由放任的资本主义体系越来越感到沮丧——这是一个重要的观点。我们看到了农民如何通过谷物协会运动、联盟运动和人民党来应对这个问题。但你们也看到了工业问题。1892年发生了霍姆斯特德罢工，卡内基钢铁公司的工人被亨利·克莱·弗里克和安德鲁·卡内基击败。1893年发生了恐慌，基本上是由于过度投机导致股市崩盘。这造成了巨大的经济问题。失业率上升。当时的总统格罗弗·克利夫兰继续他的自由放任政策。他不会介入。

人们要求政府采取行动。考克斯的军队向华盛顿特区进军——那是失业人员向华盛顿进军，要求联邦政府雇用失业人员从事公共工程。那些人——考克斯本人和他的追随者——因非法入侵而被捕。政府忽视了工人的困境。事实上，在1894年的普尔曼罢工期间，政府再次代表企业介入。克利夫兰总统动用军队和法院强制令来镇压美国铁路工会尤金·德布斯领导的罢工。

正如你们将在1896年的选举中看到的那样，共和党人威廉·麦金利将与年轻气盛的威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩竞争。他将发表他的“金十字架”演说，呼吁自由和无限的白银铸币。民主党采纳了人民党的一些思想，在选举中，共和党人威廉·麦金利获胜。人民党逐渐消失。我们将在另一段视频中了解麦金利总统执政期间发生的事情。

All right, we're back APUSH people, trying to help you score a five on that exam. Today we are taking a look at the trans-Mississippi West and what was going down with farmers from the period 1865 to 1896. If you're using any APUSH book, this video will help you out. There's how it lines up with those three books right there.

Now in other videos we've already seen people moving out west, but in this video we're taking a look at largely the settlement of the Great Plains region. And really important point to keep in mind is the federal government is going to actively promote economic development and the movement west. What does that mean? Well, if you recall during the Civil War we had something called the Homestead Act passed by Congress in 1862. And the Homestead Act offered public land up to 160 acres to any person who lived on the land and improved it for a period of 5 years, and you could get your title to the land.

Now this was intended to encourage settlement of the west, but there are difficulties and limitations to the Homestead Act. It was an enormous opportunity, but very often the quality of land that was available was rather poor. There's a high cost of supplies -- you have to buy the equipment even though the land is relatively cheap if not free. You have to buy all the farming equipment. Mother Nature -- from droughts to too cold, too hot, everything in between. There's a lot of fraud where very often it would be speculators getting the best land out in the west. And crop prices fluctuated, which left farmers in a very difficult situation.

There also was another example of the government helping western settlement, and that is also during the Civil War with the Pacific Railroad Act in 1862. And it authorized the building of the transcontinental railroad along a northern route. And the federal government is going to help this process because they're going to provide money and land subsidies to the railroad companies to construct this project. And of course in 1869 it will be completed, transforming life in the west forever.

So what are people doing out in the west? What was the economy like? And it's really important you understand that there was a boom and bust cycle to this economy -- enormous profits followed by huge economic collapse. Very often you see this in the mining industry. There's a whole bunch of mining booms you can see them on the map. You know California Gold Rush is the most famous one, but you have in 1858 gold being discovered at Pikes Peak in Colorado. The famous Comstock Lode in 1859 in Nevada, and that leads to Nevada entering the Union as a state relatively quickly.

And these conditions in the mines were very, very difficult. It's extremely dangerous. A lot of people are coming in. You know overnight these towns would emerge with nearly half of the people living in these towns being foreign born. We got people from Latin America, from Asia, from Europe and from the United States in these mining towns. So they're like this melting pot of people. One-third of the people in the mining towns on the west coast were Chinese immigrants. And the mining industry is going to have a huge impact especially with the environment. Hydraulic mining where they're using high-pressure equipment to try to access the material, the minerals, is going to devastate the environment. And of course when more and more people come out, you're going to have conflict with native people which will lead to the loss of Native American land.

Another important industry in the west is the cattle industry. And really you got to keep in mind that the Spanish and then the Mexican cowboys -- the vaqueros -- had been doing this for a very long time before Texas was a part of the United States. And the concept is simple, right? You take these cattle and you transport them along this vast open grass -- basically they get to eat for free. And the American cattle industry starts to grow. And the railroad really opens up new markets as you saw the cows go up to the north to cities such as Dodge City or Abilene, Kansas. And you transport those cows to eastern markets. And once again just like the mining industry -- boom and bust cycle because very often you would have things like bad winters where it would be really cold and the cows would die. Prices would drop. Overgrazing where the grass would run out. Farmers are eventually going to put up barbed wire fencing which is going to cause all sorts of problems between the farmers and the cattlemen. And as a result you have the boom and bust continuing.

That you need to keep in mind when we're talking about the west is the myth versus the reality. There's a very romanticized view of the American West, and you could see that in literature, paintings, and of course the famous dime novels. And very often in these dime novels you have these cowboys roaming the frontier -- all romantic view of these brave, honorable men. Often times they ignore the complexity of Native American life and the reality of life in the west as very difficult, lonely and challenging.

One of the things about the west that's really unique is the melting pot nature of the American West. Like we've already said, you have huge amounts of Chinese immigrants coming in. So you have a vibrant Chinese community. They are going to be of course with the California Gold Rush. Great photo -- you see all these different groups together trying to strike it rich. And then of course with the building of the railroad, the Chinese labor is going to be an important part of that. And of course with that Chinese immigration comes a rise of nativism that you should know about with the Chinese Exclusion Act eventually being passed.

And a lot of the cowboys out in the west were in fact African-American or Mexican. The original cowboys were Mexican vaqueros. The importance of religion in the west is important. A lot of different groups came out west. We saw the Mormons go west as a result of the discrimination they faced. And in 1896, Utah enters the Union as a state after the church formally drops the practice of polygamy. And women's suffrage also kind of shows you the complexity of the west. It was much more common out in the west for women to have the right to vote. In fact, Wyoming is the first state to grant women the right to vote, followed by other states out in the west such as Utah. And the reality is that is a way to encourage women to come out west and also to honor the fact that they are playing an important role on these homesteads in these communities in the west.

Now life in the trans-Mississippi west of course you really got to talk about the native people that are there. And we're going to focus on the Plains Indians out west. And there's a whole variety of people -- the Sioux, the Blackfoot, the Crow, the Comanche -- who make up this area in the light blue. And there's a variety of environmental factors, but really what is common with these groups is the heavy reliance on the hunting of bison. And these Native Americans' lives have already changed even before this time period because the European introduction of the horse. It transforms mobility on the Great Plains, increases warfare between tribes, but it allows them to hunt the buffalo in new ways. The introduction of firearms, alcohol and disease all have already had impacts on the Plains Indians.

And as people are moving west as a result of these overland routes, these transcontinental railroads, these mining booms, you're going to have increasing pressure on Native American life. And this expansion of the United States is going to lead to conflict with native people. There's going to be a severe decline in the population of the bison. You could see that on that graphic right there. And there's a variety of reasons for this. One, there was an attempt to undermine Native American resistance by killing the bison. There's a demand for buffalo hides out in the east. There's the impact of the railroad expansion -- as you build the railroads you want to get rid of the buffalo so they don't get in the way of its operation. And as a result of this expansion out west into native land, the biggest impact of western expansion will take place upon the lives of Native Americans in the trans-Mississippi west. Really important you know that. And that is going to lead to horrible conflict that is known as the Indian Wars.

And there's a whole variety of examples that we can give you. We're going to focus on a few, but you can see on those red stars different places, different conflicts. Violence occurs as the homesteaders, miners and ranchers move west into native land. Sand Creek is a sad example of what this violence looked like. In 1864, the Colorado militia attacks and kills over 100 native people in Colorado -- many of them women and children. Battle of Little Bighorn takes place in 1876 where the Sioux tribe inspired by their leader and others -- Sitting Bull for example -- kills Custer, US Army officer, and his men in the seventh Cavalry. This becomes known as Custer's Last Stand, and about 264 members of the regiment were killed by the Sioux Indians. However, that victory will be short-lived because the US Army will respond with force.

And another example is with Chief Joseph who tries to lead members of the Nez Perce tribe into Canada along the route you see on the map. And eventually he and his tribal members are captured by the US government and he surrenders in 1877. And the big one that you should definitely know about is the Battle of Wounded Knee. And what happens there is a Ghost Dance Movement develops amongst the Sioux Indians in Dakota territory. And many of the Sioux Indians believe that this Ghost Dance would bring a revival -- it was a cultural and religious revival for the tribal members. And they thought that this would return their tribe to greatness and also lead to white settlers to leave. And the government of the United States wants to stop this because settlers are coming into Sioux territory, and they want these native people to be confined to their reservations.

And of course the moment of tragedy happens in 1890 at the Battle of Wounded Knee where the US Army goes into the Dakotas and kills over 200 native people -- many again women and children. This battle really -- it's almost unfair to call it a battle -- it's really a massacre. You could see one of the bodies laying in the frozen aftermath. And it marks the Battle of Wounded Knee -- important you know -- marks the end of the major Native American frontier wars. It's kind of like the final big war. And historians have documented at this great book Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown taking a look at the Native American perspective of expansion.

And there were attempts at assimilation. In fact, some people began to question the US government's treatment of the native people. That beautiful woman right there, Helen Hunt Jackson, wrote a book in 1881 called A Century of Dishonor in which she documents the mistreatment by the federal government of native people. Some people advocated that boarding schools such as Carlisle Indian School -- they would eliminate their native culture and become assimilated into American society. And others supporters of this kind of approach of assimilation as the answer supported the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887. And this was intended to end tribal ownership of land. And what it did was basically reservations would be split up into 160 acre private farms. Native Americans had to adopt this kind of private property approach, and they had the potential to receive citizenship if they lived on the land for 25 years and adopted the habits of civilized life. So they're supposed to promote Christianity, job training, separate their culture -- was the solution some felt. And the remaining land was very often sold to white settlers -- often times this was the best land. And it was a massive failure. The Dawes Act was a massive failure for Native Americans. And through war and through other means, the population of native people in the Great Plains region dramatically drops. And you could see the land shrinkage right there.

And in 1890s there's this idea that the frontier has closed. And kind of the last big land rush takes place in Oklahoma territory. If you recall, that's where Andrew Jackson during the Trail of Tears -- the Indian Removal Act -- had put the native people in Oklahoma, what is called Indian Territory. And they open up settlement in 1889, and there's a huge land rush where suddenly now the native people are being forced to relocate again. And a famous historian -- make sure you know about him -- Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 writes The Significance of the Frontier in American History. And he basically argues that in the 1890s he uses the census data from the US Census that the frontier has closed. And really he talks about in his work the importance of the frontier on American identity. It made America independent, individualistic, and it was this place that had opportunity for people. And it's this idea of the safety valve theory -- that you could always head west when the times were tough. You can leave and go west and start over and start a new.

Of course historians have since kind of criticized Jackson Turner's interpretation because it does ignore the contributions of the people that are already there -- women -- and the fact that in reality by 1890s most people were not heading west. They were in fact moving to urban cities looking for industrial jobs. So the Frontier Thesis though is extremely important in American history and American identity -- the idea of the frontier. An important concept to kind of keep in mind for a later APUSH material is in the 1890s though you are going to see this emphasis on overseas expansion in places like Cuba and the Philippines. So one frontier closes, a new one is open really quickly.

We're going to run down what farmers were up to at this time. Farming was becoming more commercialized and specialized. Farmers were focusing on single cash crops like wheat or corn. And life was difficult for farmers. They were susceptible to falling prices -- if you made too much your crop price went down. Unfair railroad business practices especially from shippers. The high cost of machinery -- you had to pay a lot of money to buy this new equipment. And very often you went in deep debt that you had difficulty paying off. The tight money supply -- they wanted more money in circulation. They did not want gold as the answer. And of course high tariffs which were supported by Republican administrations.

And so these problems lead farmers to organize. And one of the first national movements amongst farmers is the Grange Movement by Oliver Kelley. And really they organize social and educational activities for farmers, but later on they're going to demand collective reforms. They want government regulation and ownership of businesses. They don't want these railroads to have this huge amount of power that they had. And they start lobbying state legislators for reforms. And they get some laws passed. And the courts uphold those laws -- Munn versus Illinois. Basically the court rules and upholds one of the Granger laws by saying the states could regulate the railroad industry. That is overturned in the Wabash case where the court reverses and says states cannot regulate interstate commerce. And of course that will lead later on to the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act.

Another farmers movement you should be aware of is the Farmers' Alliance. They're founded in Texas in the 1870s. They're going to have problems because basically farmers were divided amongst themselves. They excluded African-Americans. In fact there is the Colored Farmers' Alliance that is formed. They ignore tenant farmers -- farmers that do not own the land. But both the Farmers' Alliance and the Grange movement will eventually kind of lead to this new political party -- a significant third party called the Populist Party. And they have a platform. They're going to run candidates such as James Weaver for president in 1892. They want government ownership of the railroads. They want the free and unlimited coinage of silver. They want to increase the money supply. They want a graduated income tax where the rich people pay more. And they want to reform politics by having a direct election of senators. And they want to use political reforms such as the initiative and the referendum. So farmers are starting to organize in response to this changing nature of the economy.

And then let's close out the 19th century really quickly here. There's a growing frustration -- a big idea over the laissez-faire capitalist system. We saw how the farmers are dealing with it with the Grange movement, the alliance movement and the Populist political party. But you also have industrial problems. In 1892 there's the Homestead Strike where workers at Carnegie Steel are defeated by Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie. There's a panic of 1893 where basically as a result of over-speculation the stock market crashes. This causes huge economic problems. Unemployment goes up. And the president at the time, Grover Cleveland, continues his laissez-faire approach. He's not going to get involved.

There is a demand for the government to do something. Coxey's Army marches on Washington D.C. -- it was unemployed men who marched to D.C. demanding that the federal government hire the jobless, the unemployed, to do public works jobs. And those people -- Coxey himself and his followers -- are arrested for trespassing. And the government ignores the plight of the workers. In fact, the government once again steps in on behalf of business during the Pullman Strike in 1894. President Cleveland uses the army and a court injunction to defeat the strike led by Eugene Debs in the American Railway Union.

And as you're going to see in the election of 1896, you're going to have the Republican William McKinley running against a young whipper-snapper William Jennings Bryan. He's going to deliver his Cross of Gold speech where he calls for the free and unlimited coinage of silver. The Democratic party takes some of the Populist ideas, and in the election the Republican William McKinley wins. The Populist party kind of fades away. And we will check out what happens under President McKinley in another video.

If you have any questions you can post a comment. If you haven't done so, subscribe and tell all your classmates to do the same so we can get that five on this APUSH exam. And thank you for watching. Have a beautiful day, a beautiful night. Peace.
