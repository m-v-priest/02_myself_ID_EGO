== 释义

What's up 你好 everyone? Today we're taking a look at the American Revolution 美国独立战争 - we finally are becoming the USA, and we're going to help you out with all of your history needs.

So remember in April of 1775, the shots 枪声 are fired at Lexington and Concord 康科德. A little bit later, you have the Second Continental Congress 第二届大陆会议 meeting in Philadelphia in May of 1775. Really, the colonies are working together (remember there's been this movement towards intercolonial unity 殖民地间团结), but keep in mind there still is no clear consensus 共识 for independence.

There was division amongst the colonists as to whether or not to declare independence - this was still a radical 激进的 idea, and most people at this point want to try to negotiate 谈判. At the same time they're trying to negotiate though, they are organizing the Continental Army 大陆军, and they pick Mr. George Washington as their commander-in-chief 总司令.

Even while they're negotiating, more battles take place. You have Bunker Hill 邦克山 in June of 1775 - the British take the hill (they take it from the colonists), but the colonists hold their own 坚守阵地, and this really builds the confidence of the colonial cause ("like we can hold our own against the most powerful military in the world").

At the same time, the colonists sought peace by sending the Olive Branch Petition 橄榄枝请愿书 to King George III. They pledge 宣誓 their loyalty - they said they want to work with Parliament 议会, they see themselves as British, and they're really trying to negotiate and try to prevent a larger war from occurring.

Now if you're wondering why they're doing this:

- Remember loyalty is deeply ingrained 根深蒂固 in the colonists
- They believe they're part of the British Empire 大英帝国
- They see themselves as British
- Colonial unity was poor for a very long time
- And rebellion 叛乱 was dangerous

Now King George III though dismisses 驳回 the Olive Branch Petition and declares the colonies in rebellion. He also hires some German mercenaries 雇佣军 to handle the situation. And it is important to note that in 1775, as the fights at Bunker Hill and Lexington and Concord have taken place, there still no clear consensus for independence amongst members of the Continental Congress.

Deeper roots of the American Revolution even before these fights started taking place, and you really have to kind of understand the ideas of the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 from the 18th and 17th century. Ideas of people like John Locke and Rousseau were strongly influencing colonial thought.

Enlightenment ideas emphasize:

- The individual over hereditary privilege 世袭特权
- There was an emphasis on reason 理性 and science

And you can really see this in the writings of John Locke. Locke said everyone has natural rights 自然权利, and the power of government is derived from popular consent 民众同意. And these ideas were coming over to North America and really influencing colonial society.

And you see the Enlightenment ideas very much represented in Thomas Paine's pamphlet 小册子 Common Sense 常识, which is published in January of 1776. And it makes the most clear, persuasive 有说服力的 argument for independence today. And what he says (a very radical idea at the time) is he calls for the creation of a republic 共和国 - a representative government based on natural rights of the people, based upon consent.

He says the colonies should break away from England. He talks about "a large continent cannot be run by an island" (by England). Paine's ideas are heavily influenced by the Enlightenment. He breaks them down in very simple language, and he says people could rebel against a government when it didn't protect their rights - and that's exactly what he's calling for.

And these ideas spread throughout the colonies. You get the final push for independence when Richard Henry Lee of Virginia issues a resolution 决议 saying the colonies should declare independence. Thomas Jefferson drafted 起草 the formal Declaration of Independence 独立宣言, and it has a couple of goals:

- You want to justify independence by listing the grievances 不满 against King George III (and you could see this if you read the Declaration of Independence - there's a whole bunch of them). There was one that was taken out - Jefferson wrote against slavery (ironically enough), blaming the king and Parliament for that, and that was removed at the insistence 坚持 of Southerners.
- Another goal of the Declaration of Independence is to rally 召集 support amongst the colonists (remember not everyone favored independence - this was still a radical idea to be pursuing).
- They also want to get assistance from foreign nations - they want to rally them to the cause of the colonies, get some help, some backup.
And the most important part of the Declaration of Independence (to this day) is it is this broad appeal by declaring unalienable rights 不可剥夺的权利 - these ideas of natural rights and that the power of government rests with the people (popular sovereignty 人民主权 rests with the people). And you could see a lot of John Locke's influence throughout Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence.

And by July of 1776, the Declaration of Independence is formally adopted 正式通过, and we America now. Before you break out the fireworks 烟花 and the hot dogs and all that other good stuff that we celebrate on the 4th of July, you have to understand that colonial unity was really questionable at best.

On one side, you have the Patriots 爱国者 - and these are the colonists who fought against the British. They supported the American Revolution, and the largest number of them were in the New England area around Boston. But they were never a majority of the population - anywhere between 30 to 40% of people in the colonies were patriots.

On the other side were the Loyalists 效忠派 - and these were of course colonists loyal to the British. They were opposed to independence. Numbers vary, but anywhere between 20 to 30% of people were loyalists. They were called Tories 托利党人 over in England, and they tended to be educated, wealthy, older, more conservative people who were connected to the monarchy 君主制 or members of the Anglican clergy 英国国教神职人员.

They are going to have a hard time because they are going to be on the losing side. They're treated as traitors 叛徒 during and after the American Revolution. Their property was very often seized 没收, and they were harassed 骚扰, and a lot of them are going to leave the United States during and after the war is over.

And it's important to note there's also a third group which are those people who were neutral or apathetic 冷漠的. They didn't really care - you know, they were more loyal to their colony or their state, their region. They just wanted to be on their farm, so they weren't really committed to the American independence cause. And this is anywhere between about a third of the people in the colonies.

It's important you also know that this battle between England versus America - both were coming in with certain strengths and weaknesses.

On England's side:

- Great Britain was militarily 军事上 and economically superior to the colonies
- They had the best army
- They had a very very developed manufacturing sector 制造业 (so they were able to provide supplies)
- Whereas the colonists were poorly trained, poorly supplied and so on
- As we mentioned, there was considerable loyalist opposition in the colony (so not all the colonists support the cause) - that's going to be a strength for England and a weakness for the colonies
- And of course a big colonial weakness (we'll break down next video) is there was a weak government structure under the Continental Congress and eventually the first national government (the Articles of Confederation 联邦条例)
You know, the government couldn't really get the economy going - they printed paper money which was worthless. So colonies are going to have a rough time.

In spite of this rough time, the colonies are going to have certain strengths:

- They had of course greater familiarity with the land (they're fighting on their home turf 主场) - they had home field advantage
- They're fighting a defensive war 防御战 (meaning all they have to do is not lose and they would win the war)
- And they're going to use tactics such as guerrilla warfare 游击战 where they're going to kind of attack when appropriate and engage in battles that are favorable to them
- They're going to have resilient 有韧性的 military and political leadership
- They're fighting for a cause that they believe in
- And you're going to see great leaders like George Washington (especially as he rallies 集结 the troops at Valley Forge during a low moment in the war)
- And it's important to not underestimate the ideological commitment 意识形态承诺 - they're fighting once again for a purpose, whereas England's fighting to keep colonies that don't want to be with them (it doesn't really have as much passion attached to it)
- And another big strength for the colonies is the eventual support from European allies (especially France following the Battle of Saratoga - make sure you know that)

Which leads us to our next point - why did France help out the colonists? One factor was France hoped to regain its power in North America and Europe. And if you recall, they suffered a bad defeat in the Seven Years' War (the French and Indian War) where they lost all their territory in North America, so they want some payback 报复 against England.

But there's other reasons for France to support the colonists:

- If England is removed from the 13 colonies, this would mean an end of British mercantile 重商主义的 policies like the Navigation Acts 航海条例 (that said the colonies could only trade certain goods to England)
- And therefore France would be able to freely trade with the colonies - so there was an economic motive
- And some elements of French society were caught up in the idealism 理想主义 and the Enlightenment ideas - they want to support this revolutionary movement
Ben Franklin goes over to France (you could see him getting his bald head tickled there in that painting) to help negotiate the treaty. And France was actually giving the colonists secret aid prior to 1778, but nothing formal - no formal alliance until following the Battle of Saratoga.

Once the colonists win that battle in 1778, France and America sign a treaty, and this provides the colonists with money, weapons, naval support 海军支援 (which is hugely important because now they can have a navy on their side), and soldiers. And really key to the American victory is going to be French assistance.

There are a lot of battles of the American Revolution (you don't need to be experts on them), but a quick rundown 概述 of some of the key ones:

- Lexington & Concord (opening shots)
- Bunker Hill (they technically lose - the colonists lose - but it kind of is a morale boost 士气提升: "Hey, perhaps we can actually hold our own")

- It's important to understand from 1775 to 1777, things are bad for the Patriot cause. The British are occupying New York, they're occupying Philadelphia - things aren't going too swell.

You do get another victory where Washington famously crosses the Delaware River and captures the German mercenary troops at the Battle of Trenton, followed up a week later by the Battle of Princeton (another morale boost - "Hey, we're getting a win" - that's always key).

Battle of Saratoga - the British surrender to the Americans, and this brings in French assistance. France joins the war on the side of the Americans.

You might want to know that following this period, later on England focused their war effort on the southern colonies. And the reason for that is there's a lot of loyalists in that region, and there's a high slave population, so therefore they're hoping that would work to their advantage - perhaps cause tension within the colonies and disrupt their ability to fight the war.

And make sure you know about the Battle of Yorktown, which is the final major battle in October of 1781, when General Cornwallis surrenders to the Americans and the French troops. The French military plays a key role at Yorktown - they blockaded 封锁 the sea (you could see that on the map), and George Washington gets the victory along with his French homies 伙伴.

Which leads us to the Treaty of Paris of 1783. And the Treaty of Paris is negotiated by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay. They headed to Paris to negotiate an end to the war (they never finish that painting - fun story right there).

And the Treaty of Paris, when it is all said and done and signed, it does a couple of things:

- England recognized the United States' independence (we are free)
- The boundary of the US would extend to the Mississippi River (you could see our before and after) - we would go all the way up to the Lakes
- So England's still going to control Canada, and Spain will control Florida and the territory west of the Mississippi River

The Americans do agree to do some things:

- They must respect the rights of the loyalists (so property rights and things like that)
- Debt should be repaid to not only the loyalists but also to British creditors 债权人

And following the war, there will be some conflicts in these different areas.

A question you often times see on the AP exam is the impacts of the American Revolution, so important to know why it started and then what are the outcomes. And one of the big impacts is going to be greater political democracy in the new state and national governments.

You know, many state constitutions abolished many old European laws and traditions. And one example of this can be seen the restrictions on allowing titles of nobility 贵族头衔 to be granted in many state constitutions.

There's different ideas of what republicanism 共和主义 would mean - how much or how democratic would this new nation be? There was increases in democracy, but there were limits to it. Many states eliminated property requirements from voting (um, so for example the big one is Pennsylvania - they had a unicameral legislature 一院制立法机构 where most white men could vote and there was no governor).

But not all states did this. In spite of this democratization 民主化, it's important to note the colonial elite remained in power. Other states restricted political involvement (meaning you had to own property in order to be eligible to vote). Most states did not have full democracy - it was not extended to African-Americans, women, Native Americans unfortunately.

And so one of the things you're going to see throughout American history is this movement towards greater democratic participation.

The American Revolution inspired revolutions in France, Haiti, and in Latin America. And you're going to see revolutions take place, and very often they're going to be inspired by the words found in the Declaration of Independence.

Social impacts of the American Revolution - you're really going to see this in the realm of women. They play a significant role:

- They maintained farms and businesses while the men were away fighting the war
- Many women served as nurses and cooks following the Continental Army around
- And even before the war, we saw the importance of women in the economic boycotts 经济抵制 with the Daughters of Liberty with the spinning bees 纺织集会
- There's even one Massachusetts woman who dressed in men's clothing and served in the Army for 17 months

- Now as a result of these contributions, women began to demand greater rights. One important figure is Abigail Adams (wifey of John Adams). She reminded her husband to "remember the ladies," and she called for greater rights for women.

As a result of women's experiences in the movement for independence and the formation of a new republic, there was this ideal of Republican Motherhood 共和母亲, which called on women to teach republican values within the family. So women played a very important role in the new republic of raising the children of the home to be good citizens in this new nation.

In spite of some of these changes, it's important to note women were still treated as second-class citizens 二等公民:

- Women were not able to vote
- Married women could not own property or sign contracts
- And there were numerous restrictions on the rights of women

During the war, Native Americans often times fought on the side of the British. And the big reason for this is the British limited colonial settlement (remember the Proclamation line of 1763 - you could see on the map - had restricted the movement of white settlers into Native American land).

So many Native Americans sided with the British. So when the war was over, this was a huge defeat for Native Americans because now white settlers were unchecked into Native American land.

Siding with the British wasn't always the case. For example, the Iroquois Confederation 易洛魁联盟 was divided over the issue - they tried to stay neutral in the beginning of the war, and then some tribes fought for the colonists and many others fought for the British.

But for Native Americans, it's important to keep in mind their land is now opened up to the United States all the way to the Mississippi River.

The American Revolution had a lot of impacts on the African-American community:

- African-Americans eventually were allowed to fight in the Continental Army
- And there were many African-Americans who fought for the Revolutionary cause
- But there were also African-Americans who fought for the British

The British royal governor of Virginia (Lord Dunmore) promised freedom to any slave who fought for the British against the colonists. Unfortunately for those individuals, the British lose, so that freedom was not granted.

Following the American Revolution, there was gradual emancipation 渐进解放 in the northern and middle states. You know, for many there was a growing awareness of inequalities in societies - the hypocrisy of "all men are created equal" and the fact that slavery was not economically profitable in those regions. All of those things lead to states in the North and the middle granting emancipation.

You could see this on the map - the years emancipation takes place, and really famously with the Pennsylvania gradual emancipation law of 1780. This law said no more slaves could come into the state, and children born to slave parents would be considered free. So you're going to get the gradual disappearance of slavery in the North.

And the South - in spite of slavery slowly kind of dying out in the middle states and the northern states later on, slavery will expand in the South and in the adjacent western lands. And what's going to happen is you're going to get distinct regional identities develop between the North and the South (one slave, one free).

This will of course create distinct regional attitudes towards slavery. Each area (the North and the South and the West) will have distinct regional identities, and this will ultimately lead into problems later on.

And as we will see in our next video, slavery will be protected in the Constitution. So even though it will end in some places, it will very much be a part of the fabric 结构 of American life.

That's going to do it for today. Hopefully you learned a whole lot, and if you did, click like on the video, tell your friends about the channel, and if you have any questions, post them in the comment section. Until next time, have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好！今天我们要来看看美国独立战争——我们终于要成为美利坚合众国了，本期将满足你对这段历史的所有求知需求。

记住在1775年4月，列克星敦和康科德打响了第一枪。稍后在1775年5月，第二届大陆会议在费城召开。实际上各殖民地正在协同合作（记得当时有股殖民地联合的运动势头），但要明白此时对于独立仍没有明确共识。

殖民者内部对于是否宣布独立存在分歧——这仍是个激进的想法，当时大多数人仍想尝试谈判。不过就在他们试图谈判的同时，他们也在组建大陆军，并推选乔治·华盛顿先生作为总司令。

即便在谈判期间，更多战役仍在继续。1775年6月的邦克山战役——英军夺取了山头（从殖民者手中夺走），但殖民者展现了顽强战斗力，这极大增强了殖民地事业的信心（"我们居然能抗衡世界上最强大的军队"）。

与此同时，殖民者向乔治三世国王递交《橄榄枝请愿书》寻求和平。他们宣誓效忠——表示愿与议会合作，自视为英国人，真心试图通过谈判避免大规模战争爆发。

若你好奇他们为何这样做：

* 记住忠诚观念在殖民者心中根深蒂固
* 他们自认是大英帝国的一部分
* 他们视自己为英国人
* 殖民地长期缺乏团结
* 而且造反风险极大

然而乔治三世国王驳回了《橄榄枝请愿书》，宣布殖民地叛乱。他还雇佣德国雇佣兵来应对局势。值得注意的是，尽管1775年已爆发邦克山、列克星敦和康科德战役，大陆会议成员间对独立仍无明确共识。

美国革命的根源在这些战斗爆发前就已埋下，你必须理解17-18世纪启蒙运动的思想。约翰·洛克和卢梭等人的理念深刻影响着殖民地的思潮。

启蒙思想强调：

* 个人价值高于世袭特权
* 推崇理性与科学

这在约翰·洛克的著作中体现得淋漓尽致。洛克认为人人拥有自然权利，政府权力源于民众认可。这些思想传入北美，深刻塑造着殖民社会。

托马斯·潘恩1776年1月出版的小册子《常识》充分体现了启蒙思想。它至今仍是对独立最清晰有力的论证。他提出（当时非常激进的）建立共和国的主张——基于人民自然权利与认可的代议制政府。

他呼吁殖民地脱离英国统治。提出"一个大洲不该被小岛统治"（指英国）。潘恩的思想深受启蒙运动影响。他用浅白语言阐释：当政府不保护人民权利时，反抗是正当的——这正是他倡导的。

这些思想在殖民地广泛传播。弗吉尼亚的理查德·亨利·李提出决议案呼吁宣布独立，成为最后推手。托马斯·杰斐逊起草《独立宣言》，其目标包括：

* 通过列举乔治三世罪状来正当化独立（细读宣言可见一长串控诉）。被删除的一条是杰斐逊反对奴隶制的条款（颇具讽刺），他归咎于国王和议会，但在南方代表坚持下删除。
* 另一个目标是凝聚殖民者支持（记住并非所有人都支持独立——这仍是激进主张）
* 他们还寻求外国援助——争取国际支持

宣言至今最重要的部分是宣告不可剥夺权利——自然权利理念及政府权力源于人民（主权在民）。可见杰斐逊撰写时深受洛克思想影响。

1776年7月《独立宣言》正式通过，美利坚合众国诞生。但在你准备7月4日庆祝的烟花热狗之前，必须明白殖民地团结度仍堪忧。

一方是爱国者——反抗英国的殖民者。他们支持革命，新英格兰地区尤其是波士顿周边人数最多。但他们从未占人口多数——约30-40%的殖民者是爱国者。

另一方是效忠派——忠于英国的殖民者。他们反对独立，约占20-30%。在英国被称为托利党，多为受过教育、富裕、年长的保守派，与王室有关联或属英国圣公会神职人员。

他们将处境艰难，因其站在失败方。在革命期间及战后被视为叛徒，财产常被没收，遭受迫害，许多人会在战争期间及战后离开美国。

值得注意的是还有第三群体——中立或冷漠者。他们只忠于自己的殖民地或地区，只想安心务农，对独立事业并不热衷。约占殖民地人口三分之一。

必须了解英美双方的优劣势：

英国方面：

* 军事经济占绝对优势
* 拥有最强军队
* 制造业高度发达（能充足补给）
* 而殖民军训练匮乏、补给短缺
* 如前所述，殖民地存在大量效忠派（非全民支持革命）——这成为英国的优势和殖民地的软肋
* 殖民地政府结构薄弱（大陆会议及后来的《邦联条例》下的首届政府）——下期视频详述

政府无力提振经济——发行的纸币形同废纸。殖民地处境艰难。

尽管处境艰难，殖民地也有优势：

* 熟悉本土地形（主场作战）
* 进行的是防御战（只需避免失败即为胜利）
* 采用游击战术——择机出击
* 拥有坚韧的军事政治领导层
* 为信念而战
* 涌现出华盛顿等杰出领袖（尤其在低谷时期的福吉谷整军）
* 不可低估其意识形态信念——他们为理想而战，而英国只是为保住离心离德的殖民地（缺乏激情）
* 另一大优势是获得欧洲盟友支持（特别是萨拉托加战役后的法国）

这就引出了关键点——法国为何援助殖民者？部分原因是法国希望重夺在北美和欧洲的权势。回忆七年战争（法国印第安战争）的惨败使他们失去北美全部领土，亟需报复英国。

但法国援美还有其他原因：

* 英国退出13殖民地意味着《航海条例》等重商政策终结（该政策限定殖民地只能与英国交易特定商品）
* 法国将获得与殖民地的自由贸易权——存在经济动机
* 法国社会部分人士被启蒙理想感召——愿支持这场革命
本杰明·富兰克林赴法协助谈判条约（可见画作中他被挠光头的场景）。实际上法国在1778年前就秘密援助殖民者，但直到萨拉托加战役后才正式结盟。

1778年殖民者获胜后，法美签订条约，殖民者获得资金、武器、海军支援（至关重要）及士兵。法国的援助实为美国取胜关键。

独立战争有许多战役（无需全部掌握），以下是关键战役速览：

* 列克星敦与康科德（首战）
* 邦克山（技术上殖民者战败，但士气大振："我们或许真能抗衡"）

需明白1775-1777年间爱国者形势严峻。英军占领纽约和费城——情况不妙。

华盛顿著名的特拉华河突袭，在特伦顿战役俘获德国雇佣兵，一周后又赢下普林斯顿战役（再次提振士气——"我们正在取胜"很关键）。

萨拉托加战役——英军向美军投降，此举赢得法国参战援助。

之后英军将战略重心转向南方殖民地，因该地区效忠派众多且奴隶人口密集，英军希望借此制造殖民地内部分裂。

务必记住1781年10月的约克镇战役——最后大战。康沃利斯将军向美法联军投降。法军在约克镇发挥关键作用——海上封锁（地图可见），华盛顿与法国战友赢得胜利。

这引出了1783年《巴黎和约》。本杰明·富兰克林、约翰·亚当斯和约翰·杰伊赴巴黎谈判终战（他们始终未完成那幅名画——有趣的故事）。

《巴黎和约》正式生效后：

* 英国承认美国独立
* 美国疆界扩至密西西比河（可见前后对比图）——北抵五大湖
* 英国仍控制加拿大，西班牙控制佛罗里达及密西西比河以西

美国同意：

* 尊重效忠派权利（如财产权）
* 偿还效忠派及英国债权人的债务

战后这些地区将产生一些冲突。

AP考试常问美国革命的影响，需了解起因与结果。重大影响之一是新的州政府和国家政府推进了政治民主。

许多州宪法废除了欧洲旧法律传统。例如多州宪法禁止授予贵族头衔。

对共和主义有不同理解——这个新国家该多民主？民主有所推进但有限度。宾夕法尼亚等州取消选举财产限制（采用一院制，多数白人男性可投票，不设州长）。

但非所有州都如此。尽管民主化，殖民地上层仍掌权。有些州限制政治参与（须有产才可投票）。多数州未实现全面民主——非裔、女性、原住民仍被排除。

因此你将看到美国历史始终朝着扩大民主参与的方向发展。

美国革命激励了法国、海地和拉美的革命运动。这些革命常受《独立宣言》的启发。

革命的社会影响尤其体现在女性领域：

* 男性出征时她们维持农场和生意运转
* 许多女性随大陆军担任护士和厨师
* 战前就有"自由之女"纺织活动和经济抵制中的重要表现
* 甚至有位马萨诸塞女性女扮男装服役17个月

鉴于这些贡献，女性开始要求更多权利。重要人物约翰·亚当斯之妻阿比盖尔·亚当斯提醒丈夫"别忘了女士们"，呼吁扩大女性权利。

基于女性在独立运动和新共和国建立中的经历，产生了"共和母亲"理念，号召女性在家庭中灌输共和价值观。因此女性在新共和国承担着培养下一代好公民的重要角色。

尽管有这些变化，女性仍是二等公民：

* 无投票权
* 已婚女性不能拥有财产或签合同
* 权利处处受限

战争中原住民多支持英国，主因是英国限制殖民扩张（记住1763年公告线——地图可见——限制白人西进原住民土地）。

因此许多原住民支持英国。战争结束对他们意味着重大失败，因为白人 settlers 将长驱直入原住民领地。

但并非所有原住民都支持英国。如易洛魁联盟内部分裂——起初试图中立，后有些部落支持殖民者，更多支持英国。

但对原住民而言，关键是他们的土地将向美国开放直至密西西比河。

革命对非裔群体影响深远：

* 非裔最终获准加入大陆军
* 许多非裔为革命事业而战
* 也有非裔为英军效力

弗吉尼亚皇家总督邓莫尔勋爵许诺为英军作战的奴隶可获得自由。遗憾的是英军战败，承诺落空。

革命后北方和中部各州逐步解放奴隶。越来越多人意识到社会不平等——"人人生而平等"的虚伪，以及这些地区奴隶制经济收益有限。这些因素促使北方和中部各州推行解放。

可见地图标注的解放时间，尤其是1780年宾夕法尼亚渐进解放法。该法禁止新奴隶入境，奴隶子女视为自由人。因此北方奴隶制将逐渐消失。

而南方——尽管奴隶制在中北部逐渐消亡，却在南方及毗邻西部扩张。这将导致南北形成鲜明地域差异（一方蓄奴，一方自由）。

这自然造成对奴隶制的区域态度分歧。每个区域（北方、南方、西部）将形成独特认同，最终引发后续问题。

正如下期视频将展现的，奴隶制在宪法中得到保护。因此尽管部分地区废除，它仍深植于美国肌理。

今天就到这里。希望您学有所获，如果喜欢请点赞视频，向朋友推荐本频道，有任何问题欢迎留言。下次再见，祝您今日愉快。 peace！

Here's the properly formatted and punctuated version with paragraph breaks:

[Music]
What's up everyone? Today we're taking a look at the American Revolution - we finally are becoming the USA, and we're going to help you out with all of your history needs.

So remember in April of 1775, the shots are fired at Lexington and Concord. A little bit later, you have the Second Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia in May of 1775. Really, the colonies are working together (remember there's been this movement towards intercolonial unity), but keep in mind there still is no clear consensus for independence.

There was division amongst the colonists as to whether or not to declare independence - this was still a radical idea, and most people at this point want to try to negotiate. At the same time they're trying to negotiate though, they are organizing the Continental Army, and they pick Mr. George Washington as their commander-in-chief.

Even while they're negotiating, more battles take place. You have Bunker Hill in June of 1775 - the British take the hill (they take it from the colonists), but the colonists hold their own, and this really builds the confidence of the colonial cause ("like we can hold our own against the most powerful military in the world").

At the same time, the colonists sought peace by sending the Olive Branch Petition to King George III. They pledge their loyalty - they said they want to work with Parliament, they see themselves as British, and they're really trying to negotiate and try to prevent a larger war from occurring.

Now if you're wondering why they're doing this:

- Remember loyalty is deeply ingrained in the colonists
- They believe they're part of the British Empire
- They see themselves as British
- Colonial unity was poor for a very long time
- And rebellion was dangerous

Now King George III though dismisses the Olive Branch Petition and declares the colonies in rebellion. He also hires some German mercenaries to handle the situation. And it is important to note that in 1775, as the fights at Bunker Hill and Lexington and Concord have taken place, there still no clear consensus for independence amongst members of the Continental Congress.

Deeper roots of the American Revolution even before these fights started taking place, and you really have to kind of understand the ideas of the Enlightenment from the 18th and 17th century. Ideas of people like John Locke and Rousseau were strongly influencing colonial thought.

Enlightenment ideas emphasize:

- The individual over hereditary privilege
- There was an emphasis on reason and science

And you can really see this in the writings of John Locke. Locke said everyone has natural rights, and the power of government is derived from popular consent. And these ideas were coming over to North America and really influencing colonial society.

And you see the Enlightenment ideas very much represented in Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, which is published in January of 1776. And it makes the most clear, persuasive argument for independence today. And what he says (a very radical idea at the time) is he calls for the creation of a republic - a representative government based on natural rights of the people, based upon consent.

He says the colonies should break away from England. He talks about "a large continent cannot be run by an island" (by England). Paine's ideas are heavily influenced by the Enlightenment. He breaks them down in very simple language, and he says people could rebel against a government when it didn't protect their rights - and that's exactly what he's calling for.

And these ideas spread throughout the colonies. You get the final push for independence when Richard Henry Lee of Virginia issues a resolution saying the colonies should declare independence. Thomas Jefferson drafted the formal Declaration of Independence, and it has a couple of goals:

- You want to justify independence by listing the grievances against King George III (and you could see this if you read the Declaration of Independence - there's a whole bunch of them). There was one that was taken out - Jefferson wrote against slavery (ironically enough), blaming the king and Parliament for that, and that was removed at the insistence of Southerners.
- Another goal of the Declaration of Independence is to rally support amongst the colonists (remember not everyone favored independence - this was still a radical idea to be pursuing).
- They also want to get assistance from foreign nations - they want to rally them to the cause of the colonies, get some help, some backup.
And the most important part of the Declaration of Independence (to this day) is it is this broad appeal by declaring unalienable rights - these ideas of natural rights and that the power of government rests with the people (popular sovereignty rests with the people). And you could see a lot of John Locke's influence throughout Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence.

And by July of 1776, the Declaration of Independence is formally adopted, and we America now. Before you break out the fireworks and the hot dogs and all that other good stuff that we celebrate on the 4th of July, you have to understand that colonial unity was really questionable at best.

On one side, you have the Patriots - and these are the colonists who fought against the British. They supported the American Revolution, and the largest number of them were in the New England area around Boston. But they were never a majority of the population - anywhere between 30 to 40% of people in the colonies were patriots.

On the other side were the Loyalists - and these were of course colonists loyal to the British. They were opposed to independence. Numbers vary, but anywhere between 20 to 30% of people were loyalists. They were called Tories over in England, and they tended to be educated, wealthy, older, more conservative people who were connected to the monarchy or members of the Anglican clergy.

They are going to have a hard time because they are going to be on the losing side. They're treated as traitors during and after the American Revolution. Their property was very often seized, and they were harassed, and a lot of them are going to leave the United States during and after the war is over.

And it's important to note there's also a third group which are those people who were neutral or apathetic. They didn't really care - you know, they were more loyal to their colony or their state, their region. They just wanted to be on their farm, so they weren't really committed to the American independence cause. And this is anywhere between about a third of the people in the colonies.

It's important you also know that this battle between England versus America - both were coming in with certain strengths and weaknesses.

On England's side:

- Great Britain was militarily and economically superior to the colonies
- They had the best army
- They had a very very developed manufacturing sector (so they were able to provide supplies)
- Whereas the colonists were poorly trained, poorly supplied and so on
- As we mentioned, there was considerable loyalist opposition in the colony (so not all the colonists support the cause) - that's going to be a strength for England and a weakness for the colonies
- And of course a big colonial weakness (we'll break down next video) is there was a weak government structure under the Continental Congress and eventually the first national government (the Articles of Confederation)
You know, the government couldn't really get the economy going - they printed paper money which was worthless. So colonies are going to have a rough time.

In spite of this rough time, the colonies are going to have certain strengths:

- They had of course greater familiarity with the land (they're fighting on their home turf) - they had home field advantage
- They're fighting a defensive war (meaning all they have to do is not lose and they would win the war)
- And they're going to use tactics such as guerrilla warfare where they're going to kind of attack when appropriate and engage in battles that are favorable to them
- They're going to have resilient military and political leadership
- They're fighting for a cause that they believe in
- And you're going to see great leaders like George Washington (especially as he rallies the troops at Valley Forge during a low moment in the war)
- And it's important to not underestimate the ideological commitment - they're fighting once again for a purpose, whereas England's fighting to keep colonies that don't want to be with them (it doesn't really have as much passion attached to it)
- And another big strength for the colonies is the eventual support from European allies (especially France following the Battle of Saratoga - make sure you know that)

Which leads us to our next point - why did France help out the colonists? One factor was France hoped to regain its power in North America and Europe. And if you recall, they suffered a bad defeat in the Seven Years' War (the French and Indian War) where they lost all their territory in North America, so they want some payback against England.

But there's other reasons for France to support the colonists:

- If England is removed from the 13 colonies, this would mean an end of British mercantile policies like the Navigation Acts (that said the colonies could only trade certain goods to England)
- And therefore France would be able to freely trade with the colonies - so there was an economic motive
- And some elements of French society were caught up in the idealism and the Enlightenment ideas - they want to support this revolutionary movement
Ben Franklin goes over to France (you could see him getting his bald head tickled there in that painting) to help negotiate the treaty. And France was actually giving the colonists secret aid prior to 1778, but nothing formal - no formal alliance until following the Battle of Saratoga.

Once the colonists win that battle in 1778, France and America sign a treaty, and this provides the colonists with money, weapons, naval support (which is hugely important because now they can have a navy on their side), and soldiers. And really key to the American victory is going to be French assistance.

There are a lot of battles of the American Revolution (you don't need to be experts on them), but a quick rundown of some of the key ones:

- Lexington & Concord (opening shots)
- Bunker Hill (they technically lose - the colonists lose - but it kind of is a morale boost: "Hey, perhaps we can actually hold our own")

- It's important to understand from 1775 to 1777, things are bad for the Patriot cause. The British are occupying New York, they're occupying Philadelphia - things aren't going too swell.

You do get another victory where Washington famously crosses the Delaware River and captures the German mercenary troops at the Battle of Trenton, followed up a week later by the Battle of Princeton (another morale boost - "Hey, we're getting a win" - that's always key).

Battle of Saratoga - the British surrender to the Americans, and this brings in French assistance. France joins the war on the side of the Americans.

You might want to know that following this period, later on England focused their war effort on the southern colonies. And the reason for that is there's a lot of loyalists in that region, and there's a high slave population, so therefore they're hoping that would work to their advantage - perhaps cause tension within the colonies and disrupt their ability to fight the war.

And make sure you know about the Battle of Yorktown, which is the final major battle in October of 1781, when General Cornwallis surrenders to the Americans and the French troops. The French military plays a key role at Yorktown - they blockaded the sea (you could see that on the map), and George Washington gets the victory along with his French homies.

Which leads us to the Treaty of Paris of 1783. And the Treaty of Paris is negotiated by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay. They headed to Paris to negotiate an end to the war (they never finish that painting - fun story right there).

And the Treaty of Paris, when it is all said and done and signed, it does a couple of things:

- England recognized the United States' independence (we are free)
- The boundary of the US would extend to the Mississippi River (you could see our before and after) - we would go all the way up to the Lakes
- So England's still going to control Canada, and Spain will control Florida and the territory west of the Mississippi River

The Americans do agree to do some things:

- They must respect the rights of the loyalists (so property rights and things like that)
- Debt should be repaid to not only the loyalists but also to British creditors

And following the war, there will be some conflicts in these different areas.

A question you often times see on the AP exam is the impacts of the American Revolution, so important to know why it started and then what are the outcomes. And one of the big impacts is going to be greater political democracy in the new state and national governments.

You know, many state constitutions abolished many old European laws and traditions. And one example of this can be seen the restrictions on allowing titles of nobility to be granted in many state constitutions.

There's different ideas of what republicanism would mean - how much or how democratic would this new nation be? There was increases in democracy, but there were limits to it. Many states eliminated property requirements from voting (um, so for example the big one is Pennsylvania - they had a unicameral legislature where most white men could vote and there was no governor).

But not all states did this. In spite of this democratization, it's important to note the colonial elite remained in power. Other states restricted political involvement (meaning you had to own property in order to be eligible to vote). Most states did not have full democracy - it was not extended to African-Americans, women, Native Americans unfortunately.

And so one of the things you're going to see throughout American history is this movement towards greater democratic participation.

The American Revolution inspired revolutions in France, Haiti, and in Latin America. And you're going to see revolutions take place, and very often they're going to be inspired by the words found in the Declaration of Independence.

Social impacts of the American Revolution - you're really going to see this in the realm of women. They play a significant role:

- They maintained farms and businesses while the men were away fighting the war
- Many women served as nurses and cooks following the Continental Army around
- And even before the war, we saw the importance of women in the economic boycotts with the Daughters of Liberty with the spinning bees
- There's even one Massachusetts woman who dressed in men's clothing and served in the Army for 17 months

- Now as a result of these contributions, women began to demand greater rights. One important figure is Abigail Adams (wifey of John Adams). She reminded her husband to "remember the ladies," and she called for greater rights for women.

As a result of women's experiences in the movement for independence and the formation of a new republic, there was this ideal of Republican Motherhood, which called on women to teach republican values within the family. So women played a very important role in the new republic of raising the children of the home to be good citizens in this new nation.

In spite of some of these changes, it's important to note women were still treated as second-class citizens:

- Women were not able to vote
- Married women could not own property or sign contracts
- And there were numerous restrictions on the rights of women

During the war, Native Americans often times fought on the side of the British. And the big reason for this is the British limited colonial settlement (remember the Proclamation line of 1763 - you could see on the map - had restricted the movement of white settlers into Native American land).

So many Native Americans sided with the British. So when the war was over, this was a huge defeat for Native Americans because now white settlers were unchecked into Native American land.

Siding with the British wasn't always the case. For example, the Iroquois Confederation was divided over the issue - they tried to stay neutral in the beginning of the war, and then some tribes fought for the colonists and many others fought for the British.

But for Native Americans, it's important to keep in mind their land is now opened up to the United States all the way to the Mississippi River.

The American Revolution had a lot of impacts on the African-American community:

- African-Americans eventually were allowed to fight in the Continental Army
- And there were many African-Americans who fought for the Revolutionary cause
- But there were also African-Americans who fought for the British

The British royal governor of Virginia (Lord Dunmore) promised freedom to any slave who fought for the British against the colonists. Unfortunately for those individuals, the British lose, so that freedom was not granted.

Following the American Revolution, there was gradual emancipation in the northern and middle states. You know, for many there was a growing awareness of inequalities in societies - the hypocrisy of "all men are created equal" and the fact that slavery was not economically profitable in those regions. All of those things lead to states in the North and the middle granting emancipation.

You could see this on the map - the years emancipation takes place, and really famously with the Pennsylvania gradual emancipation law of 1780. This law said no more slaves could come into the state, and children born to slave parents would be considered free. So you're going to get the gradual disappearance of slavery in the North.

And the South - in spite of slavery slowly kind of dying out in the middle states and the northern states later on, slavery will expand in the South and in the adjacent western lands. And what's going to happen is you're going to get distinct regional identities develop between the North and the South (one slave, one free).

This will of course create distinct regional attitudes towards slavery. Each area (the North and the South and the West) will have distinct regional identities, and this will ultimately lead into problems later on.

And as we will see in our next video, slavery will be protected in the Constitution. So even though it will end in some places, it will very much be a part of the fabric of American life.

That's going to do it for today. Hopefully you learned a whole lot, and if you did, click like on the video, tell your friends about the channel, and if you have any questions, post them in the comment section. Until next time, have a beautiful day. Peace!
