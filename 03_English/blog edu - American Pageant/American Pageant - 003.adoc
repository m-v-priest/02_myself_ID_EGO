What's going down 发生, US history 美国历史 people? Today in this video we're going to take a look at 看一看 the New England 新英格兰 colonies 殖民地 and the middle colonies 中部殖民地. No matter which book you're using for APUSH 美国大学预修历史课程, this video is going to help you out with all of the important stuff 重要内容. Let's get started 让我们开始吧.

First important thing to keep in mind 记住 is where are these New England colonies - and they're right here. And as you can see, there's a couple of things that characterize 以...为特征 this region. Many of the people who are going to the New England colony are going for religious motives 宗教动机. There's going to be much more of a mix of both male and female settlers 男性与女性定居者. Many people are coming over as families, and they're going to form tight-knit communities 紧密联系的社区 and they're going to have a mixed economy 混合经济. And make sure you know about the differences between the New England colonies and those in the Chesapeake region 切萨皮克地区 (Virginia and Maryland).

The first of the New England colonies to be founded 建立 is the Plymouth Colony 普利茅斯殖民地, and really it's a result of religious conflict 宗教冲突 in Europe. Recall the Protestant Reformation 新教改革 sparked dramatic changes 引发剧变 in Europe and led to a rise of Puritanism 清教主义的兴起, and this happens in England as well. And you get a group of people known as Puritans 清教徒, and their whole idea is they wanted to purify 净化 the church. They were harassed 迫害 by the monarchy 君主制 over in England - the king felt they were a threat 威胁. Many Puritans were arrested, and they had these new ideas such as predestination 预定论 - that God already chose who was saved before even being born.

One group of Puritans, the Pilgrims 朝圣者, were much more radical/hardcore 更激进/强硬. These were separatists 分离主义者 who wanted to break away from 脱离 the Anglican Church 英国国教. They actually try to get to Virginia but they get a little lost (like most of the Europeans do coming over to the new world) and they land over there in the Massachusetts Bay 马萨诸塞湾 at what becomes known as Plymouth. They're aboard the Mayflower 五月花号 - you could see a replica 复制品 right there over near Boston. And before they even get to the colony, they signed something called the Mayflower Compact 五月花号公约, and this was an agreement establishing a basic government 建立基本政府 based upon majority rule 多数决原则. It established the basis for self-government 自治基础.

One of the key figures 关键人物 in the Plymouth Colony is going to be a guy by the name of William Bradford. The colony's going to struggle 艰难生存 in the beginning just like our friends over in Jamestown did, but not as much. The weather is a little bit more favorable 更有利 - it's not as hot, they don't have the mosquito problem 蚊虫问题, and they're going to get the help of a local Native American leader 原住民领袖 by the name of Squanto who's going to help this colony survive by teaching them how to farm 耕作 and hunt 狩猎. And of course the famous story - eventually they'll have the first Thanksgiving 第一次感恩节.

So the Pilgrims are the first landing 首次登陆 at Plymouth in 1620, but later on you get more Puritans coming over and they're going to establish 建立 the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Remember the Puritans want to reform 改革 the Church - they don't want to break away 脱离. They get a charter 特许状 from the King to establish the Massachusetts Bay Company, and in 1629 a Puritan by the name of John Winthrop receives a charter to establish that colony. They are going to land in 1630 in what is today Boston. And the goal of Winthrop and his Puritan followers is to, as he said, establish and to be as "a city upon a hill 山巅之城." Winthrop and his followers believed that they had an agreement with God 与上帝的约定 to build this holy society 神圣社会 that would serve as a model 典范 for the rest of the world. And so they're coming over here with these religious goals, and Winthrop is going to serve as their first governor 首任总督.

Religion is extremely important in the New England colonies. In fact, education was required - they established Harvard University 哈佛大学 to train Puritan ministers 清教牧师. But important to note: religious freedom 宗教自由 was reserved only for Puritans. Church membership 教会成员资格 was a requirement for participation in politics 政治参与. In fact, in all the New England towns you had not only schools but also the church and the town hall meeting 市政厅会议. The town hall meeting becomes an important part of direct democracy 直接民主 in Colonial America and especially the New England colonies. All churchgoing males 参加教会的男性 could participate in this form of direct democracy.

And in the New England colonies we have a mixed economy 混合经济 of both agriculture 农业 and commerce 商业. The weather was much cooler up there, so they're not going to rely on 依赖 cash crops 经济作物 like we're going to see in the Chesapeake or the South. Now keep in mind that religious toleration 宗教宽容 was not something that was practiced in the New England colonies, and people who expressed religious dissent 宗教异见 were very often quickly dealt with 迅速处理.

One such individual is Roger Williams. He questioned the Puritan leadership 清教领导层 of the colony - he questioned the leaders and the doctrine 教义, and he called for the complete separation of church and state 政教完全分离. And he also criticized the colony's treatment of Native Americans 对待原住民的方式. He felt the colonies should pay the natives for their land (what a crazy idea). And because of his questioning of the colony, he is banished 流放 from the Massachusetts Bay Colony - he's kicked out 驱逐 - and he goes off to form his own colony known as Providence, Rhode Island. This is going to be a really important colony (you could see it right there on the map) because it's the first colony with complete religious freedom 完全的宗教自由.

Another individual you should know about is Anne Hutchinson. She does something worse than Roger Williams - she's a woman and she speaks out 公开反对. She challenged the accepted role of women 女性既定角色 within the church by openly speaking out against church leaders. And just like Roger, she is also kicked out of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Make sure you know about the relationship between the colonists 殖民者 and Native Americans 美洲原住民. As the New England colonies grow (you're going to see all the different ones which will eventually form), they're inevitably going to come into contact with 接触 Native people. There is a massacre 大屠杀 that takes place in the 1630s called the Pequot War 佩科特战争 where the New England colonists nearly wipe out 几乎消灭 the Pequot tribe 佩科特部落. And you could see in that illustration them attacking a Pequot village.

One of the things the colonists do is they form something called the New England Confederation 新英格兰联盟 in 1643, and this is a military alliance 军事联盟 of all the New England colonies except Rhode Island. And it's intended to defend 保卫 the New England colonies against potential threats 潜在威胁. And the threats were many - we got not only Native American threats but you have the presence of the Dutch 荷兰人的存在 a little bit further south and also the French out in the west. England's in a civil war 内战 - there's all sorts of problems in England so the colonies are kind of left to fend for themselves 自生自灭. And so the New England Confederation is an example of colonial unity 殖民地团结 having a common purpose 共同目标 which is the defense of the colonies.

A really important war you should know about is King Philip's War 菲利普王战争 (or Metacom's War - Metacom was his Native American name). Metacom was the leader of the tribe, and he starts organizing a resistance 组织抵抗 - an alliance of native tribes 原住民部落联盟 to try to remove the Puritan settlements 清教徒定居点 from his territory. This time, unlike during the Pequot War, King Philip or Metacom has weapons - you could see that in the image. They're armed - they have these dead guns so they could fight back 反击 and have a shot 有机会. But unfortunately for King Philip, he's eventually killed and the resistance is crushed 镇压. Significant about King Philip's War: it is the last of the major Native American resistance to the New England colonies. And not only is it the increasing population of the colonies, but diseases are causing cultural and demographic changes 文化人口结构变化 for the native people in the New England region.

Moving out of the New England colonies, make sure you know about the middle colonies - and we really call these the "Bread Basket" colonies 面包篮殖民地 because they're going to produce a lot of the food for the colonists. The first one is actually inhabited by the Dutch - and before it becomes New York, it was originally a Dutch colony called New Amsterdam 新阿姆斯特丹 (you could see there in the purple some of the territory Holland controlled and what their colony looked like). Unfortunately for the Dutch, they did not have a firm grasp 牢固控制 on their colony, and Charles II sends a military expedition 军事远征 and grants the area to his brother James, the Duke of York. The territory of New Amsterdam is going to become New York, and it's going to remain a very religious and ethnically diverse colony 宗教和种族多元化的殖民地.

Another important colony is Pennsylvania 宾夕法尼亚, founded in 1681 by William Penn as a refuge 避难所 for Quakers 贵格会教徒. He wanted to create a "holy experiment 神圣实验." The group Quakers was actually known as the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers was their nickname). They're pacifists 和平主义者, they were treated very poorly in England, and so William Penn wants to establish this colony and the crown grants him a block of land 一块土地. This is a proprietorship 业主殖民地. Penn creates a very liberal colony 自由殖民地 - there is representative assembly 代议制议会 (people are voting for representation), he seeks to treat the Native Americans very fairly by buying land from them rather than just taking it. There is widespread religious toleration 广泛的宗教宽容 and freedom in Pennsylvania, and certain rights are extended to women as well - they have a right to be active in the church and to even be preachers 传教士 (things that did not happen in the New England colonies).

Some key things about the middle colonies to keep in mind is they are going to be demographically, religiously, and ethnically diverse 人口、宗教和种族多元化. So you got a mix of people in this area whether it be the Dutch, the Quakers, Protestants 新教徒, Puritans, and so on. And their economics are like I said - "Bread Basket" - they're going to be producing food especially wheat and corn, but they're also going to be involved in trade 贸易 and other things.

Now that we've broken down 分析完 all the different regions of the colonies, make sure you understand some colonial policy 殖民政策. Remember the colonies are there because of this economic theory known as mercantilism 重商主义 - the colonies exist to enrich 使富裕 the mother country 母国 (in this case England). However, in this early period you have this thing called salutary neglect 有益的忽视. England was involved in its own internal conflicts 内部冲突 such as the English Civil War, and so they're going to be largely indifferent to 漠不关心 the colonies - they're going to kind of be letting them do their own thing 放任自流 for a big chunk of this time.

There are some exceptions though - we have some policies that are put in place 实施, some mercantile laws 商业法律 such as the Navigation Acts 航海条例. And this is really England trying to keep watch over 监管 its colonies. The Navigation Acts did things like: 1) trade must be carried only on English or colonial ships 英国或殖民地船只; 2) trade had to pass through English ports 英国港口 before it can move on to other places such as France; and 3) certain enumerated goods 特定列举商品 (certain goods that are spelled out) from the colonies could be exported only to England (and it starts off with tobacco, but other goods are only allowed to be traded with England).

There is very loose enforcement 松散执法 in the beginning - in fact, smuggling 走私 was a major problem. The colonists were very often trading with the French and the Dutch and others. But later on, the English are going to try to deal with that problem - stay tuned 敬请期待. There are going to be instances where England's going to try to clamp down on 压制 the colonies. You could see that whole region in the green is going to be something called the Dominion of New England 新英格兰自治领 in 1686. This is implemented by England to increase royal control 加强王室控制 over the colonies, and the King sends over an individual by the name of Sir Edmund Andros to regulate and keep these colonies in check 约束. And he does a couple of things most of which are very unpopular - such as enforcing the Navigation Acts (which the colonies were largely ignoring), limiting the town hall meetings and other things.

And it's important to note the goals and interest of European leaders in England very often at times diverge from 与...分歧 those of the colonists, and this led to mistrust 不信任 on both sides of the Atlantic. This Dominion of New England will eventually end with the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命 in 1688 which we'll take a look at next time. And until next time, I hope you learned a whole bunch of stuff 一大堆东西.

Have a beautiful day. Peace!

美国历史爱好者们，最近怎么样？今天这期视频我们将聚焦"新英格兰殖民地", 和中部殖民地。无论你使用哪本AP美国史教材，这个视频都会帮你梳理所有重要知识点。让我们开始吧！

首先要明确**"#新英格兰殖民地#"**的位置——就在这里。这个地区有几个显著特征：*##许多移民是出于宗教动机来到这里的，男女比例更为均衡，很多人举家迁徙并形成了紧密的社区，经济发展也呈现多元化。##请务必注意"新英格兰殖民"地与"切萨皮克地区"（弗吉尼亚和马里兰）的差异。*

*##最早建立的是"普利茅斯殖民地"，这源于欧洲的宗教冲突。##宗教改革运动催生了"清教主义"，英国也出现了主张"净化教会"的##清教徒群体。他们因"预定论"等新思想（认为上帝在出生前, 就已选定得救者）遭到英国王室迫害。##其中更激进的分离派（即朝圣者）试图脱离英国国教，他们原本计划前往弗吉尼亚，但1620年乘"五月花号"误抵马萨诸塞湾的普利茅斯。登陆前签署的《五月花公约》奠定了基于多数统治的自洽政府基础。 +
##英国人不赞同政府理念, 可以跟这个国家断绝关系, 去海外建国. 中国人呢? 只能跳海? 道不行，乘桴浮于海? ##)*

**普利茅斯**的关键人物, 是威廉·布拉德福德。虽然初期与詹姆斯敦一样艰难，但得益于更温和的气候（没有蚊虫肆虐）和原住民斯宽托的农业指导，*殖民地最终存活下来，并诞生了第一"个感恩节"故事。*

1620年朝圣者登陆后，**更多清教徒于1630年在约翰·温斯罗普带领下, 建立"#马萨诸塞湾殖民地#"。温斯罗普立志打造"#山巅之城#"，要建立为世界典范的神圣社会。这里宗教氛围浓厚，创建了哈佛大学培养牧师，#但"宗教自由"仅限"清教徒"——只有教会成员才能参政。"市政会议"成为新英格兰"直接民主"的重要形式#，所有信教男性都可参与。**

*新英格兰实行"农业"与"商业"并重的混合经济。由于气候较冷，这里不像南方依赖经济作物。宗教异见者会遭严厉处置*：**罗杰·威廉姆斯因主张"政教分离"、**批评对待原住民的方式, *而被驱逐，后##创建宗教完全自由的罗德岛##"普罗维登斯殖民地"；安妮·哈钦森则因身为女性公开质疑教会权威, 同样遭驱逐。*

殖民者与原住民的关系日趋紧张：1630年代爆发"佩科特战争"，新英格兰联盟（1643年除罗德岛外, 各殖民地组成的军事同盟）共同防御荷兰、法国及原住民威胁。1675年菲利普王战争（原住民领袖"梅塔科姆"领导的武装抵抗）是原住民最后一次大规模抗争，最终以殖民者胜利告终。

中部殖民地被称为"面包篮"，主要生产粮食。**纽约原为荷兰殖民地"新阿姆斯特丹"，1664年被英国夺取并更名。** +
"宾夕法尼亚"由威廉·佩恩1681年建立，作为"贵格会"避难所, 实行"宗教宽容政策"：通过购买, 来获得原住民土地，允许女性担任牧师，设立"代议制议会"。

**早期英国因内战, 对殖民地实行"有益忽视"，但《航海条例》（要求殖民地贸易, 必须经英国船只和港口来运输）等重商主义政策, 逐渐引发矛盾。**1686年"新英格兰自治领"的设立（由埃德蒙·安德罗斯爵士强化王权控制）激化对立，直到1688年光荣革命才结束。这种母国与殖民地日益加深的信任危机，为后续历史埋下伏笔。

下期我们将探讨"光荣革命"的影响。如果觉得有帮助，请点赞视频、推荐给朋友并订阅频道。有任何问题欢迎留言。祝你有美好的一天！再见！

What's going down, US history people? Today in this video we're going to take a look at the New England colonies and the middle colonies. No matter which book you're using for APUSH, this video is going to help you out with all of the important stuff. Let's get started.
