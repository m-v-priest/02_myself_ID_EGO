How's it going, APUSH? Today we're going to be taking a look at two topics: immigration 移民 and urbanization 城市化 -- America's move to the city. If you're reading any APUSH book and you're studying the periods 1865 to 1900, we got you covered （俚语：我们能帮到你；我们能提供所需信息）. And really, a key idea of this time period is the growth of cities. There's a huge increase in urbanization, and you could see that on the map. By 1900, 40% of Americans are living in cities, and by 1920 it will be over 50% for the first time. And it's really economic opportunities in industrial jobs 工业岗位 that are bringing people to the cities.
And there's a couple of things going on here. One, you have mass immigration 大规模移民 from abroad -- people are coming mainly from Europe but also from Asia. You also have internal migration 国内移民 -- people are leaving rural areas 农村地区 and heading to urban areas 城市地区. And you also have certain groups, especially African-Americans from the 1890s all the way up to World War I, which are heading north into cities such as Chicago and New York. And there's a couple of things going on, so you have both international and internal migrations as I just mentioned.
And new technology is allowing this growth to take place. And really, you see in 1885 the first skyscraper 摩天大楼 -- it's 10 stories high in Chicago. And remember, steel is cheaper now because of the Bessemer process 贝塞麦炼钢法，and steel is becoming more affordable 价格合理的；负担得起的. You have the electric streetcars 有轨电车 which is allowing people to move across large distances in the city, so you don't have to live in the city center. In Boston, you have the first subway 地铁. And with these changes -- people moving to urban areas -- you have changing roles, for instance for women. They're taking on new jobs. Some of that new technology of the Industrial Revolution -- typewriters 打字机，telephones 电话 -- are creating new economic opportunities, which is also increasing a sense of independence 独立感 for some women.
Now with these changes come certain problems. Not everyone lived in the wealthy mansions 豪宅 that you see in that image. And the challenges that arise 出现 are many. There is a huge growth of urban poverty 城市贫困. There's a rising gap between the rich and the poor 贫富差距扩大. Many, many people live like you see in that image to the right -- in very poor conditions 恶劣的条件. In fact, this huge population increase in cities such as New York and Chicago causes problems. There's a lack of clean water. There's limited sanitation 卫生设施 and trash disposal 垃圾处理. So you have poor sanitation in the cities. You have the rise of tenements 廉价公寓 and slums 贫民窟. In fact, the famous dumbbell tenement 哑铃式公寓 was used as a way to pack more people into smaller and smaller areas. But in these tenements, in these dumbbell tenements, you have the spread of disease like cholera 霍乱 and typhoid 伤寒 and tuberculosis 肺结核.
And neighborhoods are not only segregated 隔离；分开 by class -- wealthy areas and poor areas -- but by also race and ethnicity 种族和民族. So you have ethnic segregation 种族隔离. You could see that on the map of New York in 1910 -- immigrant groups are staying in certain neighborhoods so that they can maintain their own language and culture, but also because of discrimination 歧视 keeping them out of certain neighborhoods. And for instance, you're going to see this in Little Italy in New York, in the Lower East Side it's going to largely be a Jewish neighborhood 社区. In New York, Polish neighborhoods of Chicago -- famous Pilsen -- and in the south side of Chicago you have a largely African-American community. Even though there's no Jim Crow laws 吉姆・克劳法 in the north, there still is unofficial discrimination 非官方歧视 in the north, and African-Americans find themselves stuck in certain neighborhoods at this time.
Now key to this kind of city life is the rise of political bosses 政治头目 and machine politics 政治机器. And these are very tightly organized groups, and political machines control the politics in the major cities. And the most famous example is William "Boss" Tweed of Tammany Hall 坦慕尼协会 in New York. And the process of these political machines was really simple. The political bosses controlled the rank and file 普通成员 of the party and rewarded supporters with jobs. If you vote for the political boss, for the political machine, if you are loyal politically, they're going to hook you up with positions within the government 为你在政府中安排职位. In fact, what you see happening is one of the reasons why these political machines are so effective is because they provide basic welfare-type services 基本福利服务 which were not offered by the government at the time to the poor and immigrant communities 贫困和移民社区.
Now this comes at great expense 代价巨大. In fact, you have large-scale greed 大规模贪婪，graft 贪污；受贿，corruption 腐败 and fraud 欺诈 was extremely common. And we saw previously that Thomas Nast exposes that greed, especially with regard to Tammany Hall, with his political cartoons 政治漫画.
Now a key component 关键部分 of this time period is not only urbanization but immigration. And it's important you keep in mind that there is a different type of immigrant, and people made certain generalizations 概括；归纳 about these so-called new immigrants. The old immigrants were from largely Northern and Western European countries -- England, Ireland and Germany. We saw through much of the early 19th century. These new immigrants are coming from Southern and Eastern Europe, and we're talking places like Italy, Russia, Poland and Greece. And there's a perception 看法；观念 that these new immigrants were different. And in some ways they were.
The old immigrants tended to be Protestant 新教徒 -- however, remember with the Irish there were a number of Catholics 天主教徒 who came over. But with these new immigrants, you have the majority are not Protestant. In fact, you get a huge number of Catholics, Greek Orthodox 希腊东正教徒 and Jews coming over. Another thing was the old immigrants tended to be literate 有文化的 and skilled 有技能的 -- they could read and write in their own language, and many in fact if they were from England or Ireland spoke English -- whereas these new immigrants were largely illiterate 文盲的 and unskilled. There was this perception that the old immigrants were quick to assimilate 同化，whereas these new immigrants were reluctant to assimilate 不愿同化 -- they were very clannish 排外的；小集团的 was the perception, and they stuck to themselves （俚语：独来独往；固守自己的生活方式）.
The old immigrants came from countries where there was a tradition of democracy 民主传统 or democratic principles 民主原则，where there was once again this perception -- in some ways a reality -- that these new immigrants were coming from areas with a history of radical ideas 激进思想 like communism 共产主义，anarchism 无政府主义 or socialism 社会主义. And the old immigrants, especially the Germans and the British, tended to come over and they were not completely poor -- many of them were middle class 中产阶级 -- whereas these new immigrants arrived largely poor. And what you see is the reasons these people are coming -- these so-called new immigrants -- are the same reasons why all immigrants come. And you could be breaking it down into two categories 类别: pull factors 吸引因素. America's ideals 理想 -- you have political freedom 政治自由，you have religious freedom 宗教自由 at least in principle 原则上 or the ideal of it. The story is from previous generations 前几代人 -- you're hearing about this mythic place America 神话般的美国. And key really though in this time period is the jobs created by the Industrial Revolution. There was economic opportunity 经济机会，and that's why you have this unprecedented 前所未有的 large number of immigrants coming over during this period of the Gilded Age 镀金时代.
Now there are also push factors 推动因素，and this is key when you're talking about why are so many Southern and Eastern European immigrants coming. Well for one, in Europe farm jobs were being lost to mechanization 机械化，which means there's a lack of land 土地短缺. And so if you lost your land, you're going to look for a new start 寻找新的开始 because poverty 贫困 and extremely difficult lives 极其艰难的生活 was the norm 常态 in much of Southern and Eastern Europe. There's also political instability 政治不稳定 in many of these places, especially Russia. There's a lack of political freedom 政治自由缺失 and religious persecution 宗教迫害. In fact, you have something called pogroms 大屠杀 taking place -- violence against Jews in Russia and in other parts of Eastern Europe.
So you have this huge influx 涌入 of people from a different region of Europe, and as a result you get a response to the changing immigration patterns 移民模式. One thing to keep in mind is many of the immigrants who came over were processed 办理入境手续 starting in 1892 through Ellis Island 埃利斯岛 -- an immigrant processing station 移民处理站 in New York Harbor 纽约港. And just like the old immigrants -- remember especially the Irish and the Germans -- we had the Know-Nothing Party 一无所知党. You have a rise of nativism 本土主义，except unlike with the Irish and the Germans, this one is going to be much more intense 强烈的. And there's a couple of reasons. One is racial motivations 种族动机 -- these new immigrants were seen as racially inferior 种族低劣的. They're not Anglo-Saxon 盎格鲁 - 撒克逊人. There's economic reasons 经济原因 -- there's this feeling that they took jobs 抢走工作，immigrants took jobs and lowered wages 降低工资. In fact, many labor unions 工会 oftentimes oppose these immigrants coming in and will not allow immigrants to join the union 加入工会.
There's political reasons for nativism. There's this belief, there's this perception that they're coming over with these very radical ideas 激进思想. And there's religious -- they're not Protestant, which although we are technically a country with freedom of religion 宗教自由，many people at this time are viewing America as a Protestant nation 新教国家. And as a result, you are going to have attempts at exclusion 排斥. In fact, you're going to see policies of discrimination 歧视政策 being pursued. We've already seen this with the Chinese Exclusion Act 排华法案 -- Chinese immigrants were not under the category of new immigrants that is Southern and Eastern European immigrants. But you are going to see groups like the American Protective Association 美国保护协会，which was an anti-Catholic group 反天主教组织 made up of American Protestants, and they really wanted to keep Catholic immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe out of America 阻止南欧和东欧的天主教移民进入美国.
You also have throughout the decades literacy tests 识字测试 being proposed 提议. They are vetoed 否决 by various presidents, but in 1917 they are passed 通过. And this was intended to keep the undesirable 不受欢迎的，the uneducated immigrants -- once again largely from Southern and Eastern Europe -- out of America. And an important period of time that we're going to learn about in another video is in the 1920s you're going to see the passage of quota acts 配额法案 which will severely restrict immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe 严格限制南欧和东欧移民.
Another thing you should keep in mind is the various attempts undertaken 尝试 to deal with the problems posed by urbanization and immigration. And really one of those is the Social Gospel Movement 社会福音运动. And key to that movement is this guy Walter Rauschenbusch. And the basic principle 基本原则 of the Social Gospel Movement was that Christians had a responsibility 责任 to deal with urban poverty 城市贫困，and as Christians you must work to help those in need 帮助有需要的人. There's also the Salvation Army 救世军 which comes over from England in 1879, and their basic idea is providing poverty relief 扶贫 while spreading Christian values 传播基督教价值观. You also see that with the Young Men's Christian Association -- the YMCA 基督教青年会 -- and the YWCA 基督教女青年会 also promoting Christian values. And you see this very often -- these reform movements 改革运动 are focusing on moral improvement 道德提升 of the poor or immigrants, Americanization 美国化 in these attempts to help those in need.
Unique is the settlement house movement 定居点之家运动 because they are unique in the sense that they live amongst the poor and in immigrant communities 与穷人和移民社区生活在一起. And Jane Addams 简・亚当斯 is the key figure 关键人物 in this movement in the US when she establishes Hull House 赫尔馆 in Chicago in 1889. And this provides various social services 社会服务 in the community, and it helps immigrants adapt to the new society 适应新社会. They have language classes 语言课程 -- English classes that people could participate in 参加，childhood education 儿童教育 and other services directly in the community. And they are secular-based 基于世俗的，whereas many of the others were Christian in their reform approach 改革方式.
Another key idea to keep in mind is that there were individuals who challenged and supported the social order 社会秩序 of the Gilded Age. And if you recall from the colonial period 殖民时期，there was this belief in the Protestant work ethic 新教职业道德 where if you work hard you were being a good Christian, and that was the path to godliness 虔诚. And you see during the Industrial Revolution the popularity of people like Horatio Alger 霍雷肖・阿尔杰 who wrote dime novels 廉价小说 such as Ragged Dick 衣衫褴褛的迪克 and Struggling Upward 奋力向上，and it's the story of rags to riches 从贫穷到富有 -- honesty 诚实，hard work leads to success 努力工作带来成功，people coming from the bottom 出身低微的人. Now whether this and this idea of the American dream 美国梦，if you want to call it that, was reinforced 加强 by experiences of people such as Andrew Carnegie who comes over from Scotland as an immigrant and becomes one of the most wealthy men in the world.
Now the reality is there were many, many more examples of people not going from rags to riches. And what you see during this time period are a growing number of critics 批评者 of the industrial pro-business climate 亲商的工业氛围 of the Gilded Age. Remember we had those people who talked about the gospel of wealth 财富福音论 that justified their success at the top 为他们的成功辩护 and Social Darwinism 社会达尔文主义 and others. But you get these whole groups of thinkers 思想家 such as Henry George 亨利・乔治 who wrote Progress and Poverty 进步与贫困. And what he does is he critically examines 批判性审视 the inequalities in wealth 财富不平等 caused by industrialization 工业化 and laissez-faire capitalism 自由放任资本主义. And you have others such as Edward Bellamy 爱德华・贝拉米 who wrote a utopian novel 乌托邦小说 called Looking Backward 回顾过去 about a utopian socialist society 乌托邦社会主义社会 that has fixed the social and economic injustices 社会和经济不公 of the time by adopting socialist principles 采用社会主义原则.
And what you see over and over again is people struggling to make sense of 理解 this new world of wealth and poverty and everything in between. Eventually you're going to get effort to reform these problems will eventually lead to a movement known as the Progressive Movement 进步运动 in the 1890s. We're going to cover that in another video. But key to the Progressive Movement is during this period you have a rise of the press 新闻业的兴起 -- newspaper printing becomes much more affordable 价格更实惠. There's a huge increase in education 教育的巨大发展 -- remember throwback here for a moment Horace Mann 贺拉斯・曼 in Massachusetts during the Age of Reform 改革时代 in the 1830s, 1840s. But you have increasingly in the late 19th century compulsory attendance 义务教育 in school -- high school all the way down to kindergarten 幼儿园. Tax-supported schools 公立学校 were becoming more accessible 更容易进入 not just in Northern cities, and illiteracy rates 文盲率 were dropping more and more.
Finally, African-Americans are going to have their own unique experiences and approaches to this era they find themselves in 身处的时代. And one of the key figures you should know about is Booker T. Washington 布克・T・华盛顿. He's from the South 南方，he's an ex-slave 前奴隶，he writes an autobiography 自传 called Up From Slavery 从奴役中奋起. And what he talks about is the need for African-Americans to acquire vocational skills 职业技能 -- job skills -- in order to gain self-respect 自尊 and economic security 经济保障. He's going to create an institute called the Tuskegee Institute 塔斯基吉学院 which is going to help African-Americans achieve these goals of vocational education 职业教育目标. And he does not advocate for 主张 directly challenging white supremacy 白人至上主义，and some people are going to accuse him of being an accommodationist 妥协主义者 because of his gradual approach 渐进方式 -- this so-called accepting racism 接受种族主义 and just focusing on self-help 专注于自助. But for Booker T. Washington, economic independence 经济独立 would be the ticket to Black political and civil rights 黑人政治和公民权利，and so therefore that was key to his vision 愿景.
On the opposite end was W.E.B. Du Bois 杜波依斯，and he is from the North -- from Massachusetts. He is the first African-American to receive a PhD from Harvard 哈佛大学博士学位 -- so a smart dude （俚语：聪明人）. And he helps create the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 全国有色人种协进会 in 1909 -- the NAACP. And he is different from Booker T. in that he demanded immediate political and social equality 立即实现政治和社会平等 for Black people -- that African-Americans should become intellectuals 知识分子 and resist prejudice and racism 抵制偏见和种族主义 wherever they could. And he rejects Booker T.'s gradualism 渐进主义，and he is going to be a critic of Booker T. And they're both going to offer very unique visions for African-American liberation 非洲裔美国人的解放. And for W.E.B. Du Bois, he really advocated in his book The Souls of Black Folk 黑人的灵魂 the talented tenth 十分之一有才华的人 in the Black community should become the intellectuals to lead African-Americans towards greater civil rights 领导非洲裔美国人争取.

Finally, we're done. If the video helped you at all, do me a solid （俚语：帮我个忙）-- click like on the video. If you have any questions, post a comment. Tell your friends to subscribe because I know you already have. And keep on working on getting that five in APUSH, get that college credit 大学学分. Peace.

大家好，各位APUSH的同学们！今天我们要探讨两个主题：移民和城市化——美国走向城市。如果你正在阅读任何APUSH书籍，并且正在学习1865年至1900年这段时期，我们为你准备好了。实际上，这个时期的一个关键特征是城市的增长。城市化进程迅猛发展，你们可以在地图上看到这一点。到1900年，40%的美国人居住在城市，而到1920年，这个比例将首次超过50%。工业就业带来的经济机会是吸引人们涌向城市的主要原因。

这里发生着几件事。首先，是来自国外的移民潮——人们主要来自欧洲，但也有一部分来自亚洲。其次是国内移民——人们离开农村地区前往城市地区。还有一些特定群体，特别是从1890年代一直到第一次世界大战期间的非裔美国人，他们正向北迁移到芝加哥和纽约等城市。正如我刚才提到的，这里既有国际移民，也有国内移民。

新技术正在推动这种增长。实际上，你们在1885年看到了第一座摩天大楼——它位于芝加哥，有10层高。记住，由于贝塞麦炼钢法的出现，钢铁现在更便宜，也更普及。电力有轨电车的出现使得人们可以在城市中长距离移动，所以你不再需要住在市中心。波士顿拥有了第一条地铁。随着这些变化——人们涌向城市地区——你们看到了角色的转变，例如女性。她们正在承担新的工作。工业革命的一些新技术——打字机、电话——创造了新的经济机会，这也增强了一些女性的独立感。

然而，随着这些变化而来的是某些问题。并非所有人都住在你们在那张图片中看到的富丽堂皇的宅邸里。随之而来的挑战是多方面的。城市贫困急剧增长。贫富差距日益扩大。许多人像你们在右边那张图片中看到的那样生活在非常恶劣的条件下。事实上，像纽约和芝加哥这样城市人口的急剧增加导致了许多问题。缺乏清洁的水源。卫生和垃圾处理能力有限。因此，城市卫生条件很差。贫民窟和棚户区的数量增加。事实上，著名的“哑铃式公寓”被用来在越来越小的区域内塞进更多的人。但在这些公寓里，在这些哑铃式公寓里，霍乱、伤寒和肺结核等疾病蔓延开来。

社区不仅按阶级隔离——富人区和穷人区——而且还按种族和民族隔离。因此，出现了种族隔离。你们可以在1910年纽约市的地图上看到这一点——移民群体聚集在某些社区，这样他们既可以维持自己的语言和文化，也是因为歧视将他们排除在某些社区之外。例如，你们将在纽约的小意大利看到这一点，下东区将主要是犹太人社区。在芝加哥的波兰社区——著名的皮尔森区——以及芝加哥南区，你们会看到一个主要是非裔美国人的社区。尽管北方没有吉姆·克劳法，但仍然存在非官方的歧视，非裔美国人发现自己在这个时期被困在某些社区。

这种城市生活的关键在于政治老板和政治机器的崛起。这些都是组织严密的团体，政治机器控制着主要城市的政治。最著名的例子是纽约坦慕尼协会的威廉“老爹”特威德。这些政治机器的运作过程非常简单。政治老板控制着党的基层，并用工作奖励支持者。如果你投票给政治老板，投票给政治机器，如果你在政治上忠诚，他们就会让你在政府部门获得职位。事实上，你们看到发生的一件事是，这些政治机器如此有效的原因之一是，它们向当时政府没有向穷人和移民社区提供的基本福利服务。

但这付出了巨大的代价。事实上，大规模的贪婪、贪污、腐败和欺诈行为非常普遍。我们之前看到，托马斯·纳斯特通过他的政治漫画揭露了这种贪婪，尤其是在坦慕尼协会方面。

这个时期的一个关键组成部分不仅是城市化，还有移民。重要的是你们要记住，存在着不同类型的移民，人们对这些所谓的“新移民”做出了一些概括性的判断。“老移民”主要来自北欧和西欧国家——英国、爱尔兰和德国。我们在19世纪早期的大部分时间里都看到了他们。这些“新移民”来自南欧和东欧，我们指的是意大利、俄罗斯、波兰和希腊等地。人们认为这些“新移民”与众不同。在某些方面，他们确实不同。

“老移民”倾向于信奉新教——然而，记住，随着爱尔兰移民的到来，也有相当数量的天主教徒。“新移民”中，大多数不是新教徒。事实上，你们看到大量的天主教徒、希腊东正教徒和犹太人涌入。另一件事是，“老移民”往往识字且有技能——他们可以用自己的语言读写，而且许多来自英国或爱尔兰的人实际上会说英语——而这些“新移民”大多不识字且没有技能。人们认为“老移民”更容易同化，而这些“新移民”则不愿意同化——人们认为他们非常抱团，他们只和自己人交往。

“老移民”来自有着民主或民主原则传统的国家，人们再次认为——在某种程度上也是事实——这些“新移民”来自有着共产主义、无政府主义或社会主义等激进思想历史的地区。“老移民”，特别是德国人和英国人，往往过来时并不完全贫穷——他们中的许多人是中产阶级——而这些“新移民”大多是贫穷地抵达。你们看到，这些人——这些所谓的“新移民”——到来的原因与所有移民到来的原因相同。你们可以将其分为两类：拉力因素。美国的理想——你们拥有政治自由，至少在原则上或理想上拥有宗教自由。故事来自前几代人——你们听说过这个神秘的美国。而这个时期真正的关键是工业革命创造的就业机会。存在经济机会，这就是为什么在镀金时代这个时期，有如此空前数量的移民涌入。

现在也有推力因素，当你们谈论为什么这么多南欧和东欧移民涌入时，这一点至关重要。一方面，在欧洲，农业就业机会因机械化而减少，这意味着土地匮乏。因此，如果你失去了土地，你就会寻找新的开始，因为贫困和极其艰难的生活是南欧和东欧大部分地区的常态。这些地方，特别是俄罗斯，也存在政治不稳定。缺乏政治自由和宗教迫害。事实上，你们看到了被称为“大屠杀”的事件——在俄罗斯和东欧其他地区针对犹太人的暴力行为。

因此，你们看到了来自欧洲不同地区的大量人口涌入，结果，人们对不断变化的移民模式做出了反应。需要记住的一件事是，许多移民在1892年之后通过埃利斯岛（纽约港的一个移民处理站）接受了处理。就像“老移民”一样——记住，特别是爱尔兰人和德国人——我们有了“一无所知党”。本土主义情绪高涨，但与针对爱尔兰人和德国人的本土主义不同，这一次将更加激烈。这有几个原因。一是种族动机——这些“新移民”被视为在种族上劣等。他们不是盎格鲁-撒克逊人。二是经济原因——人们认为他们抢走了工作，移民抢走了工作并降低了工资。事实上，许多工会经常反对这些移民涌入，并且不允许移民加入工会。

本土主义存在政治原因。人们相信，人们认为他们带着非常激进的思想而来。还有宗教原因——他们不是新教徒，尽管我们从技术上来说是一个宗教自由的国家，但当时许多人将美国视为一个新教国家。结果，你们将看到排斥的企图。事实上，你们将看到歧视政策的推行。我们已经通过《排华法案》看到了这一点——中国移民不属于南欧和东欧移民这些“新移民”的范畴。但你们将看到像美国保护协会这样的团体，这是一个由美国新教徒组成的反天主教团体，他们真的想阻止来自南欧和东欧的天主教移民进入美国。

在整个几十年里，识字测试也被多次提出。它们被多位总统否决，但在1917年获得通过。这旨在阻止不受欢迎的、未受过教育的移民——再次主要是来自南欧和东欧的移民——进入美国。我们将在另一段视频中了解一个重要的时期，那就是在1920年代，你们将看到配额法的通过，这将严重限制来自南欧和东欧的移民。

你们还应该记住为解决城市化和移民带来的问题所做的各种尝试。其中之一实际上是社会福音运动。这个运动的关键人物是沃尔特·劳申布施。社会福音运动的基本原则是，基督徒有责任处理城市贫困问题，作为基督徒，你们必须努力帮助那些有需要的人。救世军于1879年从英国传入美国，他们的基本理念是在传播基督教价值观的同时提供贫困救济。你们也可以在基督教青年会（YMCA）和基督教女青年会（YWCA）身上看到这一点，它们也在推广基督教价值观。你们经常看到——这些改革运动侧重于穷人或移民的道德提升，以及在这些帮助有需要的人的努力中进行美国化。

独特的在于定居所运动，因为它们的独特之处在于它们与穷人和移民社区生活在一起。简·亚当斯是美国这场运动的关键人物，她在1889年在芝加哥建立了赫尔馆。这为社区提供了各种社会服务，并帮助移民适应新的社会。他们有语言课程——人们可以参加的英语课程，儿童教育以及社区内的其他服务。它们是世俗的，而许多其他的改革方法都带有基督教色彩。

另一个需要记住的关键思想是，有些人挑战并支持镀金时代的社会秩序。如果你们还记得殖民时期，存在着一种新教伦理的信仰，即努力工作就是好基督徒，那是通往虔诚的道路。你们在工业革命时期看到了像霍雷肖·阿尔杰这样的人的流行，他写了像《衣衫褴褛的迪克》和《奋斗向上》这样的廉价小说，讲述的是白手起家的故事——诚实和努力工作导致成功，人们从底层崛起。现在，这种“美国梦”的理念是否被像安德鲁·卡内基这样的人的经历所强化，他作为移民从苏格兰来到美国，并成为世界上最富有的人之一。

然而，现实是，更多更多的人并没有白手起家。你们在这个时期看到的是，对镀金时代工业亲商氛围的批评者越来越多。记住，我们有那些谈论财富福音的人，他们为顶层的成功辩护，还有社会达尔文主义者和其他人。但你们看到像亨利·乔治这样的一整批思想家，他写了《进步与贫困》。他批判性地考察了工业化和自由放任资本主义造成的财富不平等。你们还有像爱德华·贝拉米这样的人，他写了一部乌托邦小说《回顾》，讲述了一个通过采纳社会主义原则来解决当时社会和经济不公正的乌托邦社会主义社会。

你们一次又一次地看到人们努力理解这个充满财富、贫困以及两者之间一切的新世界。最终，改革这些问题的努力将最终导致1890年代被称为进步运动的运动。我们将在另一段视频中讨论这个问题。但进步运动的关键在于，在这个时期，报刊业兴起——报纸印刷变得更加便宜。教育大幅普及——记住，暂时回顾一下1830年代和1840年代改革时期的马萨诸塞州的霍勒斯·曼。但在19世纪后期，你们看到越来越多的强制入学——从高中一直到幼儿园。税收支持的学校不仅在北方城市变得更容易获得，而且文盲率也在不断下降。

最后，非裔美国人将拥有他们自己独特的经历和应对他们所处时代的独特方式。你们应该了解的关键人物之一是布克·T·华盛顿。他来自南方，是一位前奴隶，他写了一本自传《走出奴役》。他谈到非裔美国人需要获得职业技能——工作技能——以便获得自尊和经济保障。他将创建一个名为塔斯基吉学院的机构，该机构将帮助非裔美国人实现职业教育的目标。他并不主张直接挑战白人至上主义，有些人会指责他因为他的渐进方式——这种所谓的接受种族主义并只关注自助——而是一个迁就者。但对于布克·T·华盛顿来说，经济独立将是获得黑人政治和公民权利的通行证，因此这是他愿景的关键。

另一方面是W.E.B.杜波依斯，他来自北方——马萨诸塞州。他是第一位获得哈佛大学博士学位的非裔美国人——所以是个聪明人。他帮助创建了1909年的全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）。他与布克·T的不同之处在于，他要求黑人立即获得政治和社会平等——非裔美国人应该成为知识分子，并在他们力所能及的地方抵抗偏见和种族主义。他拒绝布克·T的渐进主义，他将成为布克·T的批评者。他们都将为非裔美国人的解放提供非常独特的愿景。对于W.E.B.杜波依斯来说，他在他的著作《黑人的灵魂》中真正倡导黑人社区的“有识之士”应该成为知识分子，带领非裔美国人走向更大的公民权利。

终于讲完了。如果这个视频对你有任何帮助，请帮我个忙——点赞这个视频。如果你有任何问题，请发表评论。告诉你的朋友们订阅，因为我知道你已经订阅了。继续努力在APUSH考试中取得五分，获得大学学分。再见。

How's it going, APUSH? Today we're going to be taking a look at two topics: immigration and urbanization -- America's move to the city. If you're reading any APUSH book and you're studying the periods 1865 to 1900, we got you covered. And really, a key idea of this time period is the growth of cities. There's a huge increase in urbanization, and you could see that on the map. By 1900, 40% of Americans are living in cities, and by 1920 it will be over 50% for the first time. And it's really economic opportunities in industrial jobs that are bringing people to the cities.

And there's a couple of things going on here. One, you have mass immigration from abroad -- people are coming mainly from Europe but also from Asia. You also have internal migration -- people are leaving rural areas and heading to urban areas. And you also have certain groups, especially African-Americans from the 1890s all the way up to World War I, which are heading north into cities such as Chicago and New York. And there's a couple of things going on, so you have both international and internal migrations as I just mentioned.

And new technology is allowing this growth to take place. And really, you see in 1885 the first skyscraper -- it's 10 stories high in Chicago. And remember, steel is cheaper now because of the Bessemer process, and steel is becoming more affordable. You have the electric streetcars which is allowing people to move across large distances in the city, so you don't have to live in the city center. In Boston, you have the first subway. And with these changes -- people moving to urban areas -- you have changing roles, for instance for women. They're taking on new jobs. Some of that new technology of the Industrial Revolution -- typewriters, telephones -- are creating new economic opportunities, which is also increasing a sense of independence for some women.

Now with these changes come certain problems. Not everyone lived in the wealthy mansions that you see in that image. And the challenges that arise are many. There is a huge growth of urban poverty. There's a rising gap between the rich and the poor. Many, many people live like you see in that image to the right -- in very poor conditions. In fact, this huge population increase in cities such as New York and Chicago causes problems. There's a lack of clean water. There's limited sanitation and trash disposal. So you have poor sanitation in the cities. You have the rise of tenements and slums. In fact, the famous dumbbell tenement was used as a way to pack more people into smaller and smaller areas. But in these tenements, in these dumbbell tenements, you have the spread of disease like cholera and typhoid and tuberculosis.

And neighborhoods are not only segregated by class -- wealthy areas and poor areas -- but by also race and ethnicity. So you have ethnic segregation. You could see that on the map of New York in 1910 -- immigrant groups are staying in certain neighborhoods so that they can maintain their own language and culture, but also because of discrimination keeping them out of certain neighborhoods. And for instance, you're going to see this in Little Italy in New York, in the Lower East Side it's going to largely be a Jewish neighborhood. In New York, Polish neighborhoods of Chicago -- famous Pilsen -- and in the south side of Chicago you have a largely African-American community. Even though there's no Jim Crow laws in the north, there still is unofficial discrimination in the north, and African-Americans find themselves stuck in certain neighborhoods at this time.

Now key to this kind of city life is the rise of political bosses and machine politics. And these are very tightly organized groups, and political machines control the politics in the major cities. And the most famous example is William "Boss" Tweed of Tammany Hall in New York. And the process of these political machines was really simple. The political bosses controlled the rank and file of the party and rewarded supporters with jobs. If you vote for the political boss, for the political machine, if you are loyal politically, they're going to hook you up with positions within the government. In fact, what you see happening is one of the reasons why these political machines are so effective is because they provide basic welfare-type services which were not offered by the government at the time to the poor and immigrant communities.

Now this comes at great expense. In fact, you have large-scale greed, graft, corruption and fraud was extremely common. And we saw previously that Thomas Nast exposes that greed, especially with regard to Tammany Hall, with his political cartoons.

Now a key component of this time period is not only urbanization but immigration. And it's important you keep in mind that there is a different type of immigrant, and people made certain generalizations about these so-called new immigrants. The old immigrants were from largely Northern and Western European countries -- England, Ireland and Germany. We saw through much of the early 19th century. These new immigrants are coming from Southern and Eastern Europe, and we're talking places like Italy, Russia, Poland and Greece. And there's a perception that these new immigrants were different. And in some ways they were.

The old immigrants tended to be Protestant -- however, remember with the Irish there were a number of Catholics who came over. But with these new immigrants, you have the majority are not Protestant. In fact, you get a huge number of Catholics, Greek Orthodox and Jews coming over. Another thing was the old immigrants tended to be literate and skilled -- they could read and write in their own language, and many in fact if they were from England or Ireland spoke English -- whereas these new immigrants were largely illiterate and unskilled. There was this perception that the old immigrants were quick to assimilate, whereas these new immigrants were reluctant to assimilate -- they were very clannish was the perception, and they stuck to themselves.

The old immigrants came from countries where there was a tradition of democracy or democratic principles, where there was once again this perception -- in some ways a reality -- that these new immigrants were coming from areas with a history of radical ideas like communism, anarchism or socialism. And the old immigrants, especially the Germans and the British, tended to come over and they were not completely poor -- many of them were middle class -- whereas these new immigrants arrived largely poor. And what you see is the reasons these people are coming -- these so-called new immigrants -- are the same reasons why all immigrants come. And you could be breaking it down into two categories: pull factors. America's ideals -- you have political freedom, you have religious freedom at least in principle or the ideal of it. The story is from previous generations -- you're hearing about this mythic place America. And key really though in this time period is the jobs created by the Industrial Revolution. There was economic opportunity, and that's why you have this unprecedented large number of immigrants coming over during this period of the Gilded Age.

Now there are also push factors, and this is key when you're talking about why are so many Southern and Eastern European immigrants coming. Well for one, in Europe farm jobs were being lost to mechanization, which means there's a lack of land. And so if you lost your land, you're going to look for a new start because poverty and extremely difficult lives was the norm in much of Southern and Eastern Europe. There's also political instability in many of these places, especially Russia. There's a lack of political freedom and religious persecution. In fact, you have something called pogroms taking place -- violence against Jews in Russia and in other parts of Eastern Europe.

So you have this huge influx of people from a different region of Europe, and as a result you get a response to the changing immigration patterns. One thing to keep in mind is many of the immigrants who came over were processed starting in 1892 through Ellis Island -- an immigrant processing station in New York Harbor. And just like the old immigrants -- remember especially the Irish and the Germans -- we had the Know-Nothing Party. You have a rise of nativism, except unlike with the Irish and the Germans, this one is going to be much more intense. And there's a couple of reasons. One is racial motivations -- these new immigrants were seen as racially inferior. They're not Anglo-Saxon. There's economic reasons -- there's this feeling that they took jobs, immigrants took jobs and lowered wages. In fact, many labor unions oftentimes oppose these immigrants coming in and will not allow immigrants to join the union.

There's political reasons for nativism. There's this belief, there's this perception that they're coming over with these very radical ideas. And there's religious -- they're not Protestant, which although we are technically a country with freedom of religion, many people at this time are viewing America as a Protestant nation. And as a result, you are going to have attempts at exclusion. In fact, you're going to see policies of discrimination being pursued. We've already seen this with the Chinese Exclusion Act -- Chinese immigrants were not under the category of new immigrants that is Southern and Eastern European immigrants. But you are going to see groups like the American Protective Association, which was an anti-Catholic group made up of American Protestants, and they really wanted to keep Catholic immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe out of America.

You also have throughout the decades literacy tests being proposed. They are vetoed by various presidents, but in 1917 they are passed. And this was intended to keep the undesirable, the uneducated immigrants -- once again largely from Southern and Eastern Europe -- out of America. And an important period of time that we're going to learn about in another video is in the 1920s you're going to see the passage of quota acts which will severely restrict immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.

Another thing you should keep in mind is the various attempts undertaken to deal with the problems posed by urbanization and immigration. And really one of those is the Social Gospel Movement. And key to that movement is this guy Walter Rauschenbusch. And the basic principle of the Social Gospel Movement was that Christians had a responsibility to deal with urban poverty, and as Christians you must work to help those in need. There's also the Salvation Army which comes over from England in 1879, and their basic idea is providing poverty relief while spreading Christian values. You also see that with the Young Men's Christian Association -- the YMCA -- and the YWCA also promoting Christian values. And you see this very often -- these reform movements are focusing on moral improvement of the poor or immigrants, Americanization in these attempts to help those in need.

Unique is the settlement house movement because they are unique in the sense that they live amongst the poor and in immigrant communities. And Jane Addams is the key figure in this movement in the US when she establishes Hull House in Chicago in 1889. And this provides various social services in the community, and it helps immigrants adapt to the new society. They have language classes -- English classes that people could participate in, childhood education and other services directly in the community. And they are secular-based, whereas many of the others were Christian in their reform approach.

Another key idea to keep in mind is that there were individuals who challenged and supported the social order of the Gilded Age. And if you recall from the colonial period, there was this belief in the Protestant work ethic where if you work hard you were being a good Christian, and that was the path to godliness. And you see during the Industrial Revolution the popularity of people like Horatio Alger who wrote dime novels such as Ragged Dick and Struggling Upward, and it's the story of rags to riches -- honesty, hard work leads to success, people coming from the bottom. Now whether this and this idea of the American dream, if you want to call it that, was reinforced by experiences of people such as Andrew Carnegie who comes over from Scotland as an immigrant and becomes one of the most wealthy men in the world.

Now the reality is there were many, many more examples of people not going from rags to riches. And what you see during this time period are a growing number of critics of the industrial pro-business climate of the Gilded Age. Remember we had those people who talked about the gospel of wealth that justified their success at the top and Social Darwinism and others. But you get these whole groups of thinkers such as Henry George who wrote Progress and Poverty. And what he does is he critically examines the inequalities in wealth caused by industrialization and laissez-faire capitalism. And you have others such as Edward Bellamy who wrote a utopian novel called Looking Backward about a utopian socialist society that has fixed the social and economic injustices of the time by adopting socialist principles.

And what you see over and over again is people struggling to make sense of this new world of wealth and poverty and everything in between. Eventually you're going to get effort to reform these problems will eventually lead to a movement known as the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. We're going to cover that in another video. But key to the Progressive Movement is during this period you have a rise of the press -- newspaper printing becomes much more affordable. There's a huge increase in education -- remember throwback here for a moment Horace Mann in Massachusetts during the Age of Reform in the 1830s, 1840s. But you have increasingly in the late 19th century compulsory attendance in school -- high school all the way down to kindergarten. Tax-supported schools were becoming more accessible not just in Northern cities, and illiteracy rates were dropping more and more.

Finally, African-Americans are going to have their own unique experiences and approaches to this era they find themselves in. And one of the key figures you should know about is Booker T. Washington. He's from the South, he's an ex-slave, he writes an autobiography called Up From Slavery. And what he talks about is the need for African-Americans to acquire vocational skills -- job skills -- in order to gain self-respect and economic security. He's going to create an institute called the Tuskegee Institute which is going to help African-Americans achieve these goals of vocational education. And he does not advocate for directly challenging white supremacy, and some people are going to accuse him of being an accommodationist because of his gradual approach -- this so-called accepting racism and just focusing on self-help. But for Booker T. Washington, economic independence would be the ticket to Black political and civil rights, and so therefore that was key to his vision.

On the opposite end was W.E.B. Du Bois, and he is from the North -- from Massachusetts. He is the first African-American to receive a PhD from Harvard -- so a smart dude. And he helps create the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909 -- the NAACP. And he is different from Booker T. in that he demanded immediate political and social equality for Black people -- that African-Americans should become intellectuals and resist prejudice and racism wherever they could. And he rejects Booker T.'s gradualism, and he is going to be a critic of Booker T. And they're both going to offer very unique visions for African-American liberation. And for W.E.B. Du Bois, he really advocated in his book The Souls of Black Folk the talented tenth in the Black community should become the intellectuals to lead African-Americans towards greater civil rights.
