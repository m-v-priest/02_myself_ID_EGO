== 释义

What’s going down 怎么回事, APUSH people? Today we’re taking a look at 审视 the last 50% of the APUSH exam. We’re covering periods 6 through 9, which goes from 1865 to the present day 当今；现今. And remember, you can’t quit on 放弃 APUSH, so keep on fighting to the bitter end 坚持到底.

First period we’re going to take a look at is period six. It’s about 13.3% of the exam and it begins in 1865 with the end of the Civil War 美国内战. Couple things you better know about without a doubt 毫无疑问 is how the federal government 联邦政府 played a very active role in western expansion 西部扩张. And you could see that role of the federal government in Native American policy 美洲原住民政策. There’s a whole bunch of wars such as the Sand Creek Massacre 桑溪大屠杀, the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 (the last major Native American battle 主要战斗), the battle of Wounded Knee in 1890. Keep in mind 记住 most of these are really massacres 大屠杀 — not really fair to call them battles.

The government’s also going to play a role in its assimilation policy 同化政策. You can see that with the Dawes Severalty Act 道斯法案 where Native Americans were forced to give up 放弃 tribal ownership of land 部落土地所有权. Another area where the government plays a role is in economics 经济领域. There’s huge amounts of land grants 土地授予 and subsidies 补贴 given to the railroad companies, and of course the Homestead Act 宅地法 passed during the Civil War provides cheap land to 向……提供廉价土地 anybody willing to live on it for 5 years.

Another important idea in period six is the policy of laissez-faire 自由放任政策. This kind of government having a hands-off approach 不干预方式 during the Gilded Age 镀金时代 led to 导致 various social and political problems. And you could see those in economics where there’s the growth of trusts 托拉斯 and monopolies 垄断企业. You have the lack of enforcement 执行不力 of laws that were passed during the time period such as the Interstate Commerce Act 州际商业法 which was designed to regulate 监管 the railroads, and the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 1890年谢尔曼反托拉斯法 which was designed to prevent and break up monopolies 防止和打破垄断. Both of those had limited effectiveness 效果有限 during this Gilded Age.

Socially 社会方面, you have the rise of urban slums 城市贫民窟. Poverty 贫困 becomes a huge problem, and this is often times justified by those with money with the beliefs of social Darwinism 社会达尔文主义 — the survival of the fittest 适者生存. The poor are poor because they are lazy and they deserve to be poor 活该受穷. You do see the rise of the settlement house movement 定居点之家运动 in Chicago with Jane Addams and Hull House 赫尔馆, but largely the government’s going to ignore this problem through much of this time period.

Political problems include the rise of political machines 政治机器 which were notoriously corrupt 臭名昭著地腐败 such as Tammany Hall 坦慕尼协会 and Boss Tweed 特威德老大 in New York, and politics was very often a growing area of concern 日益关注的领域. And finally environmentally 环境方面, you’re going to have the destruction of natural resources 自然资源的破坏 most famously the buffalo 野牛. And during this time you are going to see the growth of the conservationist movement 环保运动 — for example with the Sierra Club 塞拉俱乐部.

Make sure you know about the challenges facing both labor unions 工会 and farmers during the Gilded Age and how they attempted to address these challenges 应对这些挑战. We’re going to start with labor unions. There were a lot of challenges facing workers: they had hostility 敌意 from both corporations 公司 and the government, there was division 分裂 amongst themselves between skilled and unskilled workers 熟练工人和非熟练工人, immigrant versus native born workers 移民工人与本土出生工人, and public opinion 公众舆论 very often was against the unions — they were perceived as being radical 被视为激进的.

The response of workers was to form unions 组建工会. You have the Knights of Labor 劳工骑士团 which focuses on both skilled and unskilled workers, the American Federation of Labor 美国劳工联合会 which focuses mainly on skilled workers headed by Samuel Gompers, and of course there are going to be a series of strikes 一系列罢工 such as the Homestead Strike 霍姆斯特德罢工 in 1892 and the Pullman Strike 普尔曼罢工 in 1894. Both of those are going to end in violence and defeat for labor unions 以工会的暴力冲突和失败告终.

Farmers are also going to face their own share of challenges 面临自己的一系列挑战. There’s going to be the dominance 主导地位 of the railroads especially if you’re a small farmer, and the mechanization 机械化 that was happening really pushed a lot of farmers to the brink of poverty 濒临贫困边缘. They are also going to respond in a variety of ways 以多种方式回应. They’re going to form organizations 成立组织 such as the Grange movement 格兰其运动, and later on eventually in the 1890s you’re going to get the rise of a third party 第三方政党 known as the Populist Party 人民党.

They’re going to call for reforms 呼吁改革 such as government regulation of the railroads — they want that Interstate Commerce Commission 州际商务委员会 to be used effectively, they want to enforce that 执行相关规定. They also demand the free coinage of silver 白银自由铸造 and income tax 所得税, and they would like the direct election of senators 参议员直选.

Another important thing to keep in mind 记住 is how various groups continued to face discrimination 面临歧视 during this time period. For African-Americans, post-Reconstruction 重建后 was miserable 悲惨的 in the South. You get Plessy versus Ferguson 普莱西诉弗格森案 which legalizes Jim Crow laws 使吉姆·克劳法合法化. You have the widespread disenfranchisement 广泛剥夺选举权 — doesn’t matter about that 15th amendment 第十五修正案 — literacy tests 识字测试, poll taxes 人头税, and other forms of denying the right to vote 剥夺投票权的其他形式 take place.

For immigrants, this was a period of rising nativism 本土主义抬头 especially towards Asian and Chinese immigrants on the west coast 西海岸. You get the Chinese Exclusion Act 排华法案 passed in 1882, and the new immigrants — those so-called new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe — were often times the victims of rising nativist sentiment 本土主义情绪上升的受害者.

Period 6 ends with the Spanish-American war 美西战争 in 1898 which is really a turning point 转折点 in US foreign policy 美国外交政策 that we’ll take a look at in just a moment, which leads us to period 7.

Period 7 goes from 1890 to 1945. It’s a big old period — it takes up 占 17.7% of the exam — and it really begins in 1890 because this is seen as the closing of the frontier 边疆的终结 according to Turner’s Frontier Thesis 特纳边疆理论. And of course, as already mentioned, it is the last of the major Native American wars with Wounded Knee.

Some important concepts to keep in mind 记住 are the motives of US overseas expansion 美国海外扩张的动机 and examples of that expansion. There’s a variety of reasons why the US is expanding during this time period. Not only is it the closing of the frontier, but you have economic motives 经济动机 — the desire for markets and raw materials 市场和原材料. Political motives 政治动机 — competing with Europe and Japan over in Asia and other parts of the globe 与欧洲和日本在亚洲及全球其他地区竞争. Ideological motives 意识形态动机 — this desire to spread democracy and Christianity 传播民主和基督教的愿望. And of course you have military motives 军事动机 articulated by people such as Alfred T. Mahan establishing naval bases around the world 由阿尔弗雷德·T·马汉等人阐述的在世界各地建立海军基地的动机.

Lots of examples during this time period of US expansion: you have the Open Door Policy 门户开放政策 in China under President McKinley 麦金利总统. The Spanish-American War is a huge turning point where the US acquires 获得 not only Cuba but Puerto Rico 波多黎各, Guam 关岛, and the Philippines 菲律宾. This leads to a brutal war 残酷战争 between the US and the Philippines — a very controversial war 有争议的战争 where anti-imperialists 反帝国主义者 condemn US foreign policy in the Philippines 谴责美国在菲律宾的外交政策. You have the annexation of Hawaii 吞并夏威夷 also under McKinley, and the Panama Canal 巴拿马运河 being built under Theodore Roosevelt’s rule 在西奥多·罗斯福统治下建造.

Another important concept in Period 7 is the ways that the Progressive Movement 进步运动 sought to 试图 use the power of the government to improve society 改善社会. There is a rejection of 摒弃 the laissez-faire approach of the Gilded Age. You see this in economics with trust-busting 反垄断 — Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson are all going to use the power of the Sherman Antitrust Act and other laws to break up powerful monopolies 打破强大的垄断企业. You get the passage of the Meat Inspection Act 肉类检验法, the Pure Food and Drug Act 纯净食品和药品法 — all designed to protect the nation’s food and medicine 旨在保护国家的食品和药品 — and the Hepburn Act 赫伯恩法案 which is passed to strengthen the Interstate Commerce Commission 加强州际商务委员会.

The Progressives also focus on political reforms 政治改革 — really the effort to expand democracy 扩大民主. You can see this really with the Wisconsin Idea 威斯康星理念, Robert La Follette with his reforms such as the recall 罢免权, referendum 公民投票, and initiative 创制权. These reforms spread across the country and eventually you get the 17th Amendment 第十七修正案 — something that the Populist Party was calling for earlier in the decade — which allows for the direct election of senators 允许参议员直选.

Don’t forget women are also playing a huge role in the Progressive Movement, and they’re fighting for various reforms 争取各种改革 but also for the 19th Amendment 第十九修正案 which will be achieved at the end of World War I 第一次世界大战结束时得以实现. And there were also various social reforms 社会改革 amongst some Progressives such as advocates of temperance 禁酒倡导者 — eventually will get a victory with the 18th Amendment 第十八修正案 starting prohibition 开启禁酒令 — and child labor laws 童工法 would be advocated by people such as Lewis Hine 刘易斯·海因.

No understanding of Period 7 would be complete without knowing why the US eventually went from neutrality 中立 to fighting in World War I 第一次世界大战, and how Woodrow Wilson 伍德罗·威尔逊 played a key role in the peace process 和平进程. So how do we get mixed up in this war 卷入这场战争? Well, the sinking of neutral ships 中立船只被击沉 such as the Lusitania 卢西塔尼亚号, the news of the Zimmerman Telegram 齐默尔曼电报, and Wilson’s own idealism 理想主义 — he wanted to make the world safe for democracy 让世界变得民主安全, the war to end all wars 结束所有战争的战争 — all contribute to 促成 US decision to enter World War I.

In the post-war period 战后时期, Wilson’s going to play a key role. He’s going to articulate a vision 阐述愿景 in his 14 Points 十四点和平纲领 which is largely rejected by the other Allied Powers 协约国. He does get them to agree to the League of Nations 国际联盟, but his vision for the US involvement in the League of Nations is rejected by the US Senate 美国参议院. Make sure you know about the debate regarding the League of Nations 关于国际联盟的辩论.

World War I also had an impact on the home front 国内. You should know a couple of examples, so let me give them to you: The Sedition Act 煽动叛乱法 greatly restricted civil liberties 严重限制公民自由 and it is upheld by 得到支持 the Schenck case 申克案. There’s a Great Migration of African-Americans to the North 非裔美国人向北方大迁移 looking for economic opportunities 寻找经济机会, also trying to get the heck out of 逃离 that Jim Crow South 实行种族隔离的南方, which causes increased racial tensions 加剧种族紧张局势 in Northern cities. And really important — you see support increasing for the 18th and 19th Amendments as a result of World War I.

Make sure you know how the Roaring 20s 咆哮的二十年代 was not only a decade of economic prosperity 经济繁荣 but it was also a time of increased tension 紧张加剧 in American society. It’s not just flappers 摩登女郎 and all that good stuff and jazz music. Some examples of tensions 紧张局势的例子: you get the Red Scare 红色恐慌, Palmer Raids 帕尔默大搜捕 to start off the decade — this fear of a Communist Revolution 共产主义革命 in the United States. You have the Quota Acts 配额法案 which are passed — the Immigration Quota Act of 1924 1924年移民配额法案 in particular — these are designed to keep out 阻止……进入 those so-called new immigrants. The Sacco and Vanzetti trial 萨科和万泽蒂审判 reveals the nativism 本土主义 and the anti-radical feelings 反激进情绪 of the 20s. The Scopes trial 斯科普斯审判 reveals the tension between fundamentalist 原教旨主义者 and more secular thinking 世俗思想. And prohibition 禁酒令 causes tension between rural and urban areas 城乡之间, religious and non-religious 信教者和不信教者之间.

You also have the increased racial tensions 种族紧张局势加剧 as a result of African-Americans moving to Northern cities, but you have events such as the Harlem Renaissance 哈莱姆文艺复兴 instilling a new sense of racial pride 灌输新的种族自豪感. And finally you get a group of authors who are condemning the conformity 从众现象 and feeling a bit disillusioned 幻灭 in this post-war era 战后时代. So know about these tensions that are right there below the surface 表面之下 throughout the 1920s.

A big moment is the Great Depression 大萧条, and you should definitely pay attention to 关注 the ways the New Deal 新政 responded to the problems of the Great Depression under Franklin Roosevelt 在富兰克林·罗斯福领导下 and changed the role of the federal government by creating programs intended to provide relief 救济, recovery 复苏, and reform 改革. The New Deal is going to continue some of those reforms of the Progressive Era 进步时代, but it’s really responding to the problem of the Great Depression.

Some examples of the impact 影响的例子: Social Security 社会保障 passed in 1935 establishes the federal safety net 联邦安全网 for the American people — especially the elderly 老年人, women with dependent children 有子女抚养的妇女, and the disabled 残疾人. FDIC banking reform 联邦存款保险公司银行改革 ensures people’s bank deposits 确保人们的银行存款安全. The Wagner Act 瓦格纳法案 which boosts labor unions 促进工会发展 by the federal government protecting their right to organize 联邦政府保护其组织权. And you get programs like the Works Progress Administration 工程进度管理署 and the Civilian Conservation Corps 民间资源保护队 providing public works projects 公共工程项目 for the unemployed 失业者.

There were challenges to the New Deal: the Supreme Court 最高法院 ruled some programs unconstitutional 裁定一些项目违宪 — the NRA 全国复兴管理局 and the AAA 农业调整管理局. You had some people wanting to go further 走得更远 such as Huey Long 休伊·朗 with his Share Our Wealth program 分享我们的财富计划. And of course Republicans and conservatives oppose the deficit spending 赤字支出 and the increase of the federal government under Roosevelt’s New Deal.

Finally in Period 7 you should also know about efforts of the US to remain neutral 保持中立 prior to 在……之前 the attack on Pearl Harbor 珍珠港袭击. Just like before World War I, we tried to stay out of this war 置身于战争之外. Some examples of this can be seen in the Neutrality Acts 中立法案 which forbid us from sending weapons or money to any country at war 禁止我们向任何交战国运送武器或资金. The America First Committee 美国优先委员会 wanted Roosevelt to stay out of war — kept a lot of pressure on him limiting his help for the Allies 对他施加压力限制他对盟国的援助. Cash and carry 现金自运, and of course Lend-Lease Act 租借法案.

World War II 第二次世界大战 is going to have a huge impact on the home front — both good and bad 好坏参半. The Great Depression ends as a result of the mass mobilization of the economy for the war effort 为战争进行的大规模经济动员. The New Deal helps lessen the impact of the depression, but it is World War II which will actually end it.

People of Mexican descent 墨西哥裔美国人 are going to have different experiences: you’re going to have the Bracero Program 墨西哥短期合同工计划 which is going to allow them to come in and work largely in agriculture 主要在农业领域工作, but you’re going to see increased racial tension 种族紧张局势加剧 in places like Los Angeles during the Zoot Suit Riots 佐特套装骚乱.

For Japanese Americans 日裔美国人, they’re going to suffer the ultimate injustice 遭受极大的不公 during World War II when Executive Order 9066 第9066号行政命令 forcibly puts Japanese people and people of Japanese descent into internment camps 拘留营 throughout the West Coast. This is upheld by the Korematsu Supreme Court case 科雷马茨最高法院案 as necessary for national security 出于国家安全考虑.

African-Americans have new opportunities in war factories 军工厂, but there also is continued discrimination 持续的歧视. You’re going to see various civil rights organizations 民权组织 calling for the Double Victory campaign 呼吁“双重胜利”运动 — victory against racism at home and fascism abroad 国内战胜种族主义，国外战胜法西斯主义. You will see race riots 种族骚乱 once again happening in Northern cities. And as a result of threats by A. Philip Randolph 菲利普·伦道夫, Executive Order 8802 第8802号行政命令 is going to be passed and signed by Franklin Roosevelt banning discrimination in defense work 禁止国防工作中的歧视行为.

You’re also going to see the growth of new civil rights organizations 新的民权组织 such as the Congress of Racial Equality 种族平等大会 continuing to put pressure on American society 继续向美国社会施压.

And finally in Period 7 you should know the reasons why the Allies 同盟国 defeated the Axis powers 轴心国, and it’s really the military and political cooperation 军事和政治合作 of Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin — the Big Three 三巨头. US war production 美国战争生产能力 and new technologies such as sonar 声呐, and of course the big one under the Manhattan Project 曼哈顿计划 — the atomic bomb 原子弹.

Period 7 ends with the end of World War II in 1945, and this is a major turning point 重大转折点 in American history because we emerge from the war as a major superpower 作为一个主要超级大国崛起. I think it’s appropriate at this time to celebrate — we are back-to-back World War champs 连续的世界大战冠军!

And that leads us to Period 8: 1945 to 1980. This bad boy （此处表示强调）is 15% of the exam, and it begins with the end of World War II and the US is a superpower — but we got lots of problems during this time period.

Make sure you know about the various methods the US used to try to contain Communism 遏制共产主义. This is George Kennan’s idea 乔治·凯南的理念. We are throughout this period going to be in a Cold War 冷战 against the Soviet Union 苏联. Some examples of containment 遏制的例子 can be seen in the Truman Doctrine 杜鲁门主义 — we’re giving lots of money to Greece and Turkey (they both don’t fall to the Communist 不落入共产主义阵营). The Marshall Plan 马歇尔计划 — we give a bunch of money to Europe to rebuild (they don’t fall to the Communist). The joining of NATO 北约 — this is the first time we are in a permanent peacetime alliance 永久性和平时期联盟 (forget George Washington’s advice at this point 此时先不管乔治·华盛顿的建议). And of course we’re going to have ourselves involved in some wars in Korea and Vietnam — one’s going to turn out okay, the other one not so much.

Although this period is a time of a Cold War, you should understand that the relationship between the US and the Soviets fluctuated between periods of confrontation 对抗 and détente 缓和. Some examples of conflict 冲突的例子 can be seen in the Berlin Blockade 柏林封锁 and the Berlin Airlift 柏林空运 in the late 1940s. Of course the Korean War 朝鲜战争 — we’re shooting at people, that’s a big conflict. And the Cuban Missile Crisis 古巴导弹危机 where the whole world nearly ends (luckily Kennedy and Khrushchev negotiate 肯尼迪和赫鲁晓夫进行谈判).

Some examples of détente 缓和的例子 could be seen in the Spirit of Geneva 日内瓦精神 during President Eisenhower’s administration 艾森豪威尔政府时期 — we start talking to the Soviet Union. Big détente moment happens with the SALT I treaty 第一阶段限制战略武器条约 between the US and the Soviets under Nixon 尼克松执政时期. And of course Nixon becomes the first president to go to China in 1972.

Sadly, you should also know about the ways the US supported undemocratic governments 支持非民主政府 so long as 只要 they were non-communists. And you could see this really with the use of the CIA 中央情报局 overthrowing democratically elected governments 推翻民选政府 in both Iran 伊朗 and Guatemala 危地马拉 in the 1950s. Dictatorships 独裁政权 come to power in both countries. The US supports Diem in South Vietnam 支持南越的吴庭艳 under President Kennedy — how he does not turn out so hot for us either. But as long as the governments were non-communists, we throw our support behind them 支持他们.

The Cold War also led to growing debates at home 国内引发越来越多的辩论. You see debates over the proper balance between order and liberty 秩序与自由之间的适当平衡. You have the rise of the House Un-American Activities Committee 众议院非美活动调查委员会 calling people before them 传讯民众. Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism 约瑟夫·麦卡锡和麦卡锡主义 — you have a second Red Scare 第二次红色恐慌. And there were in fact some Communists such as Alger Hiss 阿尔杰·希斯 and the Rosenbergs 罗森堡夫妇, but this leads to widespread paranoia 普遍的偏执 and in many cases violations of people’s civil liberties 侵犯公民自由.

There’s growing debates over the appropriateness of the arms race 军备竞赛 and the Space Race 太空竞赛. Remember Eisenhower’s military-industrial complex 艾森豪威尔提出的军事工业复合体 where he warned the nation about the threat of too much military spending on domestic life 警告国家过度军事开支对国内生活的威胁. And remember when the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 苏联发射人造卫星斯普特尼克号 — America freaks out 美国惊慌失措 and we start escalating our federal money to education especially math and science 加大联邦对教育尤其是数学和科学的资金投入, and also the creation of NASA 成立美国国家航空航天局.

And the big debate’s going to come with regard to the Vietnam War 越南战争. You’re going to see a growing anti-war movement 反战运动 especially after the Tet Offensive in 1968 1968年春节攻势, news about the bombing of Cambodia 轰炸柬埔寨的新闻, and news of the My Lai Massacre 美莱村大屠杀.

On the domestic front 国内方面, civil rights activists 民权活动家 used legal challenges 法律挑战, non-violence 非暴力 and direct action 直接行动 to fight segregation 种族隔离 and discrimination. Some examples of this can be seen in the Brown versus Board of Education decision 布朗诉教育委员会案裁决 in which segregation is ruled unconstitutional 种族隔离被裁定违宪 by the Supreme Court. Montgomery bus boycott 蒙哥马利巴士抵制运动 in 1955 to 56. The freedom rides 自由乘车运动 and Freedom Summer 自由之夏 are all examples of direct action and nonviolence in the civil rights struggle 民权斗争中的直接行动和非暴力的例子.

You better know about the ways that the three branches of the government 政府三个部门 eventually played a role in advancing the cause of civil rights 推进民权事业. Slowly but surely: the executive branch 行政部门 comes around when Truman desegregates the military in 1948 杜鲁门在1948年废除军队中的种族隔离. We saw the judicial branch 司法部门 doing its thing in 1954 Brown decision 1954年布朗案裁决. And the legislative branch 立法部门 under LBJ’s Great Society 在林登·约翰逊的“伟大社会”计划下 passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 1964年民权法案 banning segregation and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 1965年选举权法案.

In spite of this progress 尽管取得了这些进展, there was intense resistance 强烈抵制 from Southerners and it slowed the pace of change 减缓了变革的步伐. You could see this in the Southern Manifesto 南方宣言 where over 100 southern congressmen condemned the Supreme Court’s Brown decision 100多名南方国会议员谴责最高法院的布朗案裁决. And when Governor Orval Faubus tried to block the Little Rock Nine from attending high school in Arkansas 奥瓦尔·福伯斯州长试图阻止“小石城九学生”在阿肯色州上高中.

As Southern resistance continued and social and economic inequality remained 随着南方的抵制持续以及社会和经济不平等依然存在, disputes arose over the different philosophies for change 变革理念出现分歧. Some within the civil rights movement began to question the non-violent approach 非暴力方式, and you get people like Stokely Carmichael 斯托克利·卡迈克尔 advocating the Black Power movement 倡导黑人权力运动, Malcolm X 马尔科姆·X with the Nation of Islam 伊斯兰民族组织, and the Black Panthers 黑豹党 over in Oakland increasingly calling on African-Americans to arm themselves 呼吁非裔美国人武装自己 — black separatism 黑人分离主义 and racial pride 种族自豪感.

Other groups were inspired by the civil rights movement 受到民权运动的鼓舞 and there was a growing awareness of inequalities in American society 对美国社会不平等的认识日益加深. You could see this in the Mexican-American community 墨西哥裔美国人社区 as people like Cesar Chavez 塞萨尔·查韦斯 begin to organize. The LGBT movement 同性恋、双性恋和跨性别者运动 with the Stonewall riots 石墙骚乱 in 1969. The American Indian Movement 美国印第安人运动 forms in 1968. And various steps within the women’s rights movement 妇女权利运动 with the publication of The Feminine Mystique 《女性的奥秘》的出版, the National Organization for Women has founded it 全国妇女组织成立, and Roe versus Wade 罗诉韦德案 legalizes abortion 使堕胎合法化.

Another important thing to keep in mind 记住 is liberalism under the Great Society “伟大社会”计划下的自由主义. Lyndon Baines Johnson 林登·贝恩斯·约翰逊 continues to expand the power of the federal government 继续扩大联邦政府的权力. They’re kind of continuing some of those reforms we saw during the Progressive Movement and the New Deal. You get a whole host of programs 一系列项目 from the federal government such as Medicare 医疗保险, Medicaid 医疗补助, poverty programs such as Head Start 开端计划, Job Corps 职业训练团, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Immigration Act of 1965 which ends quotas 结束配额制度. All of these have varying degrees of success 取得不同程度的成功 but they’re all under Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.

Even before and during the Great Society, you have the Warren Court 沃伦法院 led by Earl Warren 厄尔·沃伦. Those decisions expanded democracy and individual freedoms 扩大了民主和个人自由. So you get some key court cases 关键法庭案件 such as Griswold versus Connecticut 格里斯沃尔德诉康涅狄格州案 which legalizes birth control 使节育合法化. Miranda versus Arizona 米兰达诉亚利桑那州案 which provides protection for individuals accused of a crime 为被指控犯罪的个人提供保护 (so if you’re ever arrested, make sure they read you your Miranda rights 米兰达权利).

Make sure you also know how the Great Society, the Warren Court decisions 沃伦法院裁决, and growing counterculture movements 反主流文化运动 such as the hippies 嬉皮士 and the sexual revolution 性革命 led to a resurgence of a conservative movement 导致保守主义运动的复兴. You see Barry Goldwater run in 1964 against Johnson — he loses but he kind of really sparks this conservative movement 引发了这场保守主义运动. Nixon gets elected in 1968. And of course the big daddy of the conservative movement 保守主义运动的重要人物 Ronald Reagan 罗纳德·里根 gets elected in 1980. And that’s exactly where Period 8 ends — the election of Ronald Reagan.

Which leads us to our last period — Period 9: it goes from 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan 罗纳德·里根当选, the rise of conservatism 保守主义兴起, and it goes all the way until today. This is about 5% of the exam. There will not be any essays exclusively on this time period 不会有专门针对这个时期的论文题目, but it’s always a good topic for synthesis 综合论述的好话题.

So what are some key things to know about Period 9? You should know about the reasons for the rise of the conservative movement 保守主义运动兴起的原因: belief in social and moral decay 对社会和道德堕落的看法 contributes to the rise of religious fundamentalists 导致宗教原教旨主义者的兴起 — they really mobilize around the issue of abortion 围绕堕胎问题动员起来 and eventually gay marriage 以及后来的同性婚姻问题. There’s a reduced public faith in the government’s ability to solve social and economic problems 公众对政府解决社会和经济问题的能力信心下降 — remember throughout the 70s there was high inflation 高通货膨胀, you have the Watergate crisis 水门事件 (although under Republican president 尽管是在共和党总统任期内), and the growing deficit of New Deal and Great Society programs 新政和“伟大社会”计划项目不断增加的赤字 really start to call into question 质疑 the effectiveness of the federal government.

The conservatives under Reagan did achieve some political and economic victories 取得一些政治和经济胜利 but did not completely undo all government programs or social trends 完全废除所有政府项目或扭转社会趋势. What the heck does that mean? Well here are some conservative wins 保守派的胜利: Reaganomics 里根经济学 — Reagan did manage to reduce taxes especially on the wealthy 削减富人的税收 (this is part of his trickle-down theory of economics 涓滴经济学理论), and there was the deregulation of some industries 一些行业的放松管制. However, the size of the government grew under Reagan as programs that were very popular such as Social Security and Medicare continue to expand 社会保障和医疗保险等受欢迎的项目继续扩大, and abortion continued to be legal in spite of many Christian fundamentalists wanting to ban it 尽管许多基督教原教旨主义者希望禁止堕胎, 堕胎仍然合法.

Another key part of this period is knowing about the rhetoric versus the reality of President Reagan’s foreign policy 里根总统外交政策的言辞与现实. In terms of his rhetoric 就言辞而言, Reagan was a hardcore anti-communist 坚定的反共主义者 — he called the Soviets the "evil empire" 称苏联为“邪恶帝国”, he rejected the policy of détente 拒绝缓和政策, and there was a mass increase in defense spending under Reagan (remember the Star Wars proposal 星球大战计划). The reality was Reagan was homies with President Gorbachev 与戈尔巴乔夫总统友好, and this friendship eventually led to arms control agreements 军备控制协议 and the eventual end of the Soviet Union 苏联最终解体 and thus the Cold War 冷战结束.

In spite of the end of the Cold War 尽管冷战结束, it’s important to know that the post-Cold War world led to new challenges for US foreign policy makers 冷战后的世界给美国外交政策制定者带来新的挑战. On 9/11 you had the horrible terrorist attacks 可怕的恐怖袭击, and this leads to a widespread war on terrorism 广泛的反恐战争 which eventually leads to the war in Afghanistan 阿富汗战争. Under the Bush Doctrine 布什主义, there was a preemptive strike 先发制人打击 against Iraq due to concerns over support for terrorism 支持恐怖主义 and the supposed program of weapons of mass destruction 大规模杀伤性武器计划 under Saddam Hussein 萨达姆·侯赛因. Both those things didn’t turn out very well. And with the war on terror 反恐战争, concerns over violations of civil liberties 侵犯公民自由 due to legislations such as the Patriot Act 爱国者法案 and government surveillance 政府监控.

And finally, make sure you know about the changes to American society since the 1970s 20世纪70年代以来美国社会的变化. You have changing demographics 人口结构变化 as increasing numbers of people come from Latin America and Asia (remember the Immigration Act of 1965 opens up the gates to lots of new people 1965年移民法案为许多新移民打开大门).

大家好，APUSH的同学们！今天我们来看一下APUSH考试的后50%。我们将涵盖第6至第9时期，从1865年到今天。记住，你们不能在APUSH上放弃，所以要坚持战斗到最后。

我们要看的第一个时期是第六时期。它约占考试的13.3%，始于1865年内战结束。毫无疑问，你们最好了解的是联邦政府在西部扩张中扮演了非常积极的角色。你们可以在联邦政府的印第安人政策中看到这一点。发生了一系列战争，例如沙溪大屠杀、1876年的小比格霍恩战役（最后一次主要的印第安人战役）、1890年的伤膝河战役。记住，其中大多数实际上是大屠杀——称它们为战役并不公平。

政府还将在其同化政策中发挥作用。你们可以在《道斯分配法》中看到这一点，该法迫使美洲原住民放弃部落对土地的所有权。政府发挥作用的另一个领域是经济领域。大量的土地赠予和补贴被给予铁路公司，当然，在内战期间通过的《宅地法》为任何愿意在土地上居住5年的人提供了廉价的土地。

第六时期的另一个重要思想是自由放任政策。镀金时代政府的这种不干预的做法导致了各种社会和政治问题。你们可以在经济领域看到这些问题，例如托拉斯和垄断的增长。当时通过的法律，例如旨在监管铁路的《州际商务法》和旨在阻止和拆分垄断的1890年《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》，缺乏执行。这两项法律在镀金时代的效果都有限。

在社会方面，你们看到了城市贫民窟的兴起。贫困成为一个巨大的问题，那些有钱人经常用社会达尔文主义（适者生存）的信念来为这种情况辩护。穷人之所以穷，是因为他们懒惰，他们活该贫穷。你们确实看到了简·亚当斯和赫尔之家在芝加哥发起的定居所运动的兴起，但在很大程度上，政府在这个时期的绝大部分时间里都忽视了这个问题。

政治问题包括政治机器的兴起，这些机器臭名昭著地腐败，例如纽约的坦慕尼协会和博斯·特威德，政治往往成为一个日益令人担忧的领域。最后，在环境方面，你们将看到自然资源的破坏，最著名的是野牛。在此期间，你们将看到保护主义运动的兴起——例如塞拉俱乐部。

确保你们了解镀金时代工会和农民面临的挑战，以及他们如何试图应对这些挑战。我们先从工会开始。工人们面临着许多挑战：他们受到公司和政府的敌视，熟练工人和非熟练工人、移民工人和本地工人之间存在内部分裂，公众舆论往往反对工会——他们被认为是激进的。

工人的回应是组建工会。你们有关注熟练和非熟练工人的劳工骑士团，主要关注熟练工人并由塞缪尔·冈珀斯领导的美国劳工联合会，当然，还会发生一系列罢工，例如1892年的霍姆斯特德罢工和1894年的普尔曼罢工。这两次罢工都以暴力和工会的失败告终。

农民也将面临他们自己的一系列挑战。特别是对于小农场主来说，铁路的统治地位将非常明显，而正在发生的机械化实际上将许多农民推向贫困的边缘。他们也将以各种方式做出回应。他们将组建诸如格兰其运动之类的组织，后来在1890年代，你们将看到一个被称为民粹党的第三党的崛起。

他们将呼吁进行改革，例如政府对铁路的监管——他们希望有效利用州际商务委员会，他们希望强制执行该委员会的规定。他们还要求自由铸造银币和征收所得税，并且他们希望直接选举参议员。

另一个需要记住的重要事项是，在此期间，各个群体是如何继续面临歧视的。对于非裔美国人来说，重建后的南方是悲惨的。你们有了普莱西诉弗格森案，该案使吉姆·克劳法合法化。你们看到了普遍的剥夺选举权——第15修正案对此毫无意义——进行了文化程度测试、人头税和其他剥夺投票权的形式。

对于移民来说，这是一个本土主义情绪高涨的时期，尤其是在西海岸针对亚洲和中国移民。你们在1882年通过了《排华法案》，而新移民——那些来自南欧和东欧的所谓新移民——往往是日益增长的本土主义情绪的受害者。

第六时期以1898年的美西战争结束，这实际上是美国外交政策的一个转折点，我们稍后会讨论这一点，这引领我们进入第七时期。

第七时期从1890年到1945年。这是一个漫长的时期——占考试的17.7%——它实际上始于1890年，因为根据特纳的边疆理论，这被认为是边疆的关闭。当然，正如已经提到的，伤膝河战役是最后一次主要的印第安人战争。

一些需要记住的重要概念是美国海外扩张的动机以及扩张的例子。在此期间，美国扩张的原因有很多。不仅是边疆的关闭，而且你们还有经济动机——对市场和原材料的渴望。政治动机——与亚洲和全球其他地区的欧洲和日本竞争。意识形态动机——传播民主和基督教的渴望。当然，你们还有像阿尔弗雷德·T·马汉这样的人阐述的军事动机，即在全球建立海军基地。

在此期间，美国扩张的例子有很多：你们有麦金莱总统领导下的中国门户开放政策。美西战争是一个巨大的转折点，美国不仅获得了古巴，还获得了波多黎各、关岛和菲律宾。这导致了美国和菲律宾之间的一场残酷战争——一场极具争议的战争，反帝国主义者谴责美国在菲律宾的外交政策。你们还有麦金莱领导下的夏威夷吞并，以及西奥多·罗斯福统治下建造的巴拿马运河。

第七时期的另一个重要概念是进步运动如何寻求利用政府的力量来改善社会。人们反对镀金时代的自由放任政策。你们可以在经济领域看到这一点，即反托拉斯行动——罗斯福、塔夫脱和威尔逊都将利用《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》和其他法律的力量来拆分强大的垄断企业。你们通过了《肉类检验法》、《纯净食品和药品法》——所有这些都是为了保护国家的食品和药品——以及旨在加强州际商务委员会的《赫本法案》。

进步人士还关注政治改革——真正是扩大民主的努力。你们可以在威斯康星理念中真正看到这一点，罗伯特·拉福莱特及其改革，例如罢免、公民投票和创制。这些改革遍及全国，最终你们有了第17修正案——这是民粹党在十年前呼吁的——该修正案允许直接选举参议员。

别忘了妇女也在进步运动中发挥着巨大作用，她们为各种改革而奋斗，也为将在第一次世界大战结束时实现的第19修正案而奋斗。一些进步人士中也存在各种社会改革，例如禁酒倡导者——最终将通过禁止酒精的第18修正案取得胜利——而刘易斯·海因等人将倡导童工法。

如果不了解美国最终为何从一战中立转变为参战，以及伍德罗·威尔逊在和平进程中发挥的关键作用，对第七时期的理解就不完整。那么我们是如何卷入这场战争的呢？中立船只（例如卢西塔尼亚号）的沉没、齐默曼电报的消息以及威尔逊本人的理想主义——他想让世界对民主安全，这是一场结束所有战争的战争——所有这些都促成了美国决定加入第一次世界大战。

在战后时期，威尔逊将发挥关键作用。他将在他的十四点原则中阐述一个愿景，但该愿景在很大程度上被其他协约国拒绝。他确实让他们同意了国际联盟，但他关于美国参与国际联盟的愿景被美国参议院拒绝了。确保你们了解关于国际联盟的辩论。

第一次世界大战也对国内产生了影响。你们应该了解几个例子，所以让我给你们举几个：煽动叛乱法极大地限制了公民自由，申克案维持了这一限制。大量非裔美国人涌向北方寻找经济机会，也试图摆脱南方吉姆·克劳制度的束缚，这导致北方城市种族紧张局势加剧。非常重要的一点是——你们看到由于第一次世界大战，对第18和19修正案的支持增加。

确保你们了解咆哮的二十年代不仅是经济繁荣的十年，也是美国社会紧张局势加剧的时期。这不仅仅是时髦女郎、美好事物和爵士乐。一些紧张局势的例子：你们在十年之初就看到了红色恐慌和帕尔默突袭——这是对美国共产主义革命的恐惧。你们通过了配额法案——特别是1924年的《移民配额法案》——这些法案旨在阻止那些所谓的“新移民”。萨科和凡泽蒂审判揭示了20年代的本土主义和反激进情绪。斯科普斯审判揭示了原教旨主义和更世俗的思想之间的紧张关系。而禁酒令则导致了农村和城市地区、宗教和非宗教人士之间的紧张关系。

由于非裔美国人迁往北方城市，种族紧张局势也加剧了，但你们也看到了像哈莱姆文艺复兴这样的事件，这激发了一种新的种族自豪感。最后，你们看到一群作家谴责顺从，并在战后时代感到有些幻灭。因此，了解整个1920年代潜伏在表面之下的这些紧张局势。

一个重要的时刻是大萧条，你们绝对应该关注富兰克林·罗斯福领导下的新政如何应对大萧条的问题，以及通过创建旨在提供救济、复苏和改革的项目来改变联邦政府的角色。新政将继续进步时代的某些改革，但它真正应对的是大萧条的问题。

一些影响的例子：1935年通过的社会保障法为美国人民建立了联邦安全网——特别是老年人、有受抚养子女的妇女和残疾人。联邦存款保险公司的银行改革保障了人们的银行存款。《瓦格纳法案》通过联邦政府保护工会的组织权来促进工会发展。你们还看到了像工程进展署和民间资源保护队这样的项目为失业者提供公共工程项目。

新政面临着挑战：最高法院裁定一些项目违宪——全国复兴管理局和农业调整管理局。有些人希望走得更远，例如休伊·朗和他的“分享财富”计划。当然，共和党人和保守派反对罗斯福新政下的赤字支出和联邦政府的扩张。

最后在第七时期，你们还应该了解美国在珍珠港袭击前保持中立的努力。就像第一次世界大战之前一样，我们试图置身于这场战争之外。你们可以在《中立法案》中看到一些例子，该法案禁止我们向任何交战国运送武器或资金。美国第一委员会希望罗斯福置身于战争之外——这给他施加了很大的压力，限制了他对盟军的帮助。“现金与运输”政策，当然还有《租借法案》。

第二次世界大战将对国内产生巨大的影响——既有好也有坏。由于经济为战争努力进行大规模动员，大萧条结束了。新政有助于减轻大萧条的影响，但真正结束大萧条的是第二次世界大战。

墨西哥裔美国人将有不同的经历：你们将看到“布雷塞罗计划”，该计划允许他们进入美国并在很大程度上从事农业工作，但你们将在洛杉矶等地的“祖特西装暴乱”期间看到种族紧张局势加剧。

对于日裔美国人来说，他们将在第二次世界大战期间遭受最大的不公正待遇，9066号行政命令强行将日本人和日裔人士送入整个西海岸的拘留营。科雷马苏诉美国案最高法院裁定这是国家安全所必需的。

非裔美国人在战时工厂获得了新的机会，但仍然存在持续的歧视。你们将看到各种民权组织呼吁开展“双重胜利”运动——在国内反对种族主义，在国外反对法西斯主义。你们将再次看到种族骚乱在北方城市发生。由于菲利普·伦道夫的威胁，富兰克林·罗斯福将签署并颁布8802号行政命令，禁止国防工作中的歧视。

你们还将看到诸如种族平等大会等新的民权组织不断壮大，并继续向美国社会施加压力。

最后在第七时期，你们应该了解盟军击败轴心国的原因，这实际上是丘吉尔、罗斯福和斯大林——三大巨头——的军事和政治合作。美国的战争生产和声纳等新技术，当然还有曼哈顿计划下的原子弹。

第七时期在1945年第二次世界大战结束时结束，这是美国历史上的一个重大转折点，因为我们从战争中崛起成为一个主要的超级大国。我认为现在庆祝一下是合适的——我们是背靠背的世界大战冠军！

这引领我们进入第八时期：1945年至1980年。这个时期占考试的15%，它始于二战结束，美国成为超级大国——但我们在这个时期面临许多问题。

确保你们了解美国为遏制共产主义而采取的各种方法。这是乔治·凯南的主张。在整个这个时期，我们将与苏联进行冷战。遏制的一些例子可以在杜鲁门主义中看到——我们向希腊和土耳其提供了大量资金（它们都没有落入共产主义手中）。马歇尔计划——我们向欧洲提供了大量资金以帮助重建（它们也没有落入共产主义手中）。加入北约——这是我们第一次加入永久性的和平时期联盟（此时忘记乔治·华盛顿的建议吧）。当然，我们还会卷入朝鲜和越南的一些战争——一场结果还不错，另一场则不然。

虽然这个时期是冷战时期，但你们应该理解，美国和苏联之间的关系在对抗和缓和时期之间波动。冲突的一些例子可以在1940年代末的柏林封锁和柏林空运中看到。当然，朝鲜战争——我们向人们开枪，这是一场大冲突。以及古巴导弹危机，整个世界几乎毁灭（幸运的是肯尼迪和赫鲁晓夫进行了谈判）。

缓和的一些例子可以在艾森豪威尔总统执政期间的日内瓦精神中看到——我们开始与苏联对话。尼克松领导下美国和苏联签署的第一阶段限制战略武器条约标志着一个重要的缓和时刻。当然，尼克松在1972年成为第一位访问中国的美国总统。

可悲的是，你们还应该了解美国支持非民主政府的方式，只要它们是非共产主义的。你们可以在1950年代中央情报局推翻伊朗和危地马拉民选政府的行动中真正看到这一点。两国都建立了独裁统治。肯尼迪总统领导下的美国支持南越的吴庭艳——他最终对我们来说也不是什么好人。但只要这些政府是非共产主义的，我们就支持它们。

冷战也导致了国内日益激烈的辩论。你们看到了关于秩序和自由之间适当平衡的辩论。你们看到了众议院非美活动调查委员会的崛起，他们传唤人们到他们面前。约瑟夫·麦卡锡和麦卡锡主义——你们经历了第二次红色恐慌。事实上，有一些共产主义者，例如阿尔杰·希斯和罗森堡夫妇，但这导致了广泛的偏执，并在许多情况下侵犯了人们的公民自由。

关于军备竞赛和太空竞赛的适当性，人们的争论日益激烈。记住艾森豪威尔的军事工业复合体，他在告别演说中警告国家警惕过多的军事开支对国内生活造成的威胁。记住苏联在1957年发射人造卫星时——美国吓坏了，我们开始增加联邦政府对教育（尤其是数学和科学）的资金投入，并创建了美国国家航空航天局。

最大的争论将围绕越南战争展开。你们将看到一场日益壮大的反战运动，尤其是在1968年春节攻势之后，以及关于轰炸柬埔寨和美莱大屠杀的消息传出之后。

在国内方面，民权活动家利用法律挑战、非暴力和直接行动来反对种族隔离和歧视。这方面的一些例子可以在布朗诉教育委员会案的裁决中看到，最高法院在该案中裁定种族隔离违宪。1955年至1956年的蒙哥马利巴士抵制运动。“自由乘车”运动和“自由之夏”运动都是民权斗争中直接行动和非暴力的例子。

你们最好了解政府的三个部门最终是如何在推动民权事业方面发挥作用的。虽然缓慢但肯定的是：1948年杜鲁门取消军队中的种族隔离时，行政部门的态度发生了转变。我们在1954年的布朗裁决中看到了司法部门的行动。在约翰逊总统的伟大社会计划下，立法部门通过了1964年的《民权法案》（禁止种族隔离）和1965年的《投票权法案》。

尽管取得了这些进展，但南方人的强烈抵制减缓了变革的步伐。你们可以在南方宣言中看到这一点，其中100多名南方国会议员谴责了最高法院的布朗裁决。以及当州长奥瓦尔·福布斯试图阻止小石城九名学生进入阿肯色州的高中时。

随着南方抵制的持续以及社会和经济不平等依然存在，关于变革的不同理念出现了争议。民权运动内部的一些人开始质疑非暴力方式，你们看到了像斯托克利·卡迈克尔倡导黑人权力运动，马尔科姆·X领导伊斯兰民族，以及奥克兰的黑豹党越来越呼吁非裔美国人武装起来——黑人分离主义和种族自豪感。

其他团体受到民权运动的启发，人们对美国社会的不平等现象越来越Aware。你们可以在墨西哥裔美国人社区看到这一点，像塞萨尔·查韦斯这样的人开始组织起来。1969年石墙骚乱标志着LGBT运动的兴起。美国印第安人运动成立于1968年。在女权运动内部也出现了各种进展，例如《女性的奥秘》的出版，全国妇女组织的成立，以及罗诉韦德案使堕胎合法化。

另一个需要记住的重要事项是伟大社会下的自由主义。林登·约翰逊继续扩大联邦政府的权力。他们某种程度上延续了我们在进步运动和新政期间看到的一些改革。你们看到了联邦政府的一系列项目，例如医疗保险、医疗补助、贫困项目（例如“ Head Start”）、就业培训队、《民权法案》、《1965年投票权法案》以及结束配额制度的《1965年移民法案》。所有这些都取得了不同程度的成功，但它们都属于林登·约翰逊的伟大社会计划。

甚至在伟大社会之前和期间，你们还有厄尔·沃伦领导下的沃伦法院。这些裁决扩大了民主和个人自由。因此，你们看到了一些关键的法院案件，例如格里斯沃尔德诉康涅狄格州案（使避孕合法化）。米兰达诉亚利桑那州案（为被指控犯罪的个人提供保护）（因此，如果你们被捕，请确保他们宣读你们的米兰达权利）。

确保你们还了解伟大社会、沃伦法院的裁决以及日益壮大的反主流文化运动（例如嬉皮士和性解放）是如何导致保守主义运动复兴的。你们看到巴里·戈德华特在1964年与约翰逊竞争——他输了，但他确实引发了这场保守主义运动。尼克松在1968年当选。当然，保守主义运动的巨擘罗纳德·里根在1980年当选。第八时期正是在罗纳德·里根当选时结束的。

这引领我们进入最后一个时期——第九时期：从1980年罗纳德·里根当选、保守主义兴起开始，一直延续到今天。这大约占考试的5%。不会有专门针对这个时期的论文，但它始终是一个很好的综合论述主题。

那么关于第九时期，有哪些关键点需要了解呢？你们应该了解保守主义运动兴起的原因：对社会和道德衰败的信念促成了宗教原教旨主义者的崛起——他们真正围绕堕胎问题并最终围绕同性婚姻问题动员起来。公众对政府解决社会和经济问题的能力信心下降——记住在整个70年代，通货膨胀率很高，你们经历了水门危机（尽管是在共和党总统执政期间），而新政和伟大社会计划日益增长的赤字真正开始让人质疑联邦政府的效力。

里根领导下的保守派确实取得了一些政治和经济上的胜利，但并没有完全废除所有的政府计划或社会趋势。这到底是什么意思？好吧，这里有一些保守派的胜利：里根经济学——里根确实设法降低了税收，尤其是对富人（这是他的经济学涓滴理论的一部分），并且一些行业放松了管制。然而，在里根领导下，政府规模扩大了，因为像社会保障和医疗保险这样非常受欢迎的项目继续扩大，尽管许多基督教原教旨主义者希望禁止堕胎，但堕胎仍然是合法的。

这个时期的另一个关键部分是了解里根总统外交政策的言辞与现实之间的差异。就他的言辞而言，里根是一位强硬的反共主义者——他称苏联为“邪恶帝国”，他拒绝缓和政策，并且在里根领导下国防开支大幅增加（记住“星球大战”计划）。现实情况是，里根与戈尔巴乔夫总统关系友好，这种友谊最终促成了军备控制协议以及苏联的最终解体，从而结束了冷战。

尽管冷战结束了，但重要的是要知道，后冷战世界给美国外交政策制定者带来了新的挑战。在9月11日，你们遭遇了可怕的恐怖袭击，这导致了一场广泛的反恐战争，最终导致了阿富汗战争。在布什主义的指导下，由于担心萨达姆·侯赛因支持恐怖主义及其所谓的拥有大规模杀伤性武器计划，美国对伊拉克进行了先发制人的打击。这两件事的结果都不太好。随着反恐战争的进行，人们对由于《爱国者法案》等立法和政府监控而侵犯公民自由的担忧日益增加。

最后，确保你们了解自1970年代以来美国社会的变化。随着越来越多的人来自拉丁美洲和亚洲，人口结构发生了变化（记住1965年的《移民法案》为许多新人打开了大门）。我们仍在争论这个问题——有人支持移民改革吗？关于联邦政府作用的持续辩论——你们有医疗保健法、社会保障支出和政府监控。

重要的是要注意制造业工作流失到海外，以及随之而来的美国国内收入不平等加剧。你们看到了“占领华尔街”运动，该运动引起了人们对这个问题的关注。以及对气候变化、全球变暖、我们的能源政策和石油消耗日益增长的担忧。这实际上是对所有时期的回顾，从约翰·缪尔和塞拉俱乐部到西奥多·罗斯福在进步时代的保护努力，再到蕾切尔·卡森在1960年代的《寂静的春天》（揭露了杀虫剂问题），再到伟大社会时期通过的《清洁空气法》以及尼克松在1970年创建环境保护署。

无论你们身在世界的哪个角落，第九时期都以现在结束——也就是你们参加APUSH考试的那一天。如果你们想了解更多关于这些主题的信息，请查看我们在描述中提供的复习视频——我们有很多。如果这个视频对你们有帮助，请务必点击“喜欢”并订阅（如果你们还没有这样做的话）。告诉你们所有的朋友这个频道，并发表评论回答这个问题：你们最想和美国历史上的哪个人一起悠闲地度过一周？好好想想，然后发布答案。再见！

What’s going down, APUSH people? Today we’re taking a look at the last 50% of the APUSH exam. We’re covering periods 6 through 9, which goes from 1865 to the present day. And remember, you can’t quit on APUSH, so keep on fighting to the bitter end.

First period we’re going to take a look at is period six. It’s about 13.3% of the exam and it begins in 1865 with the end of the Civil War. Couple things you better know about without a doubt is how the federal government played a very active role in western expansion. And you could see that role of the federal government in Native American policy. There’s a whole bunch of wars such as the Sand Creek Massacre, the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 (the last major Native American battle), the battle of Wounded Knee in 1890. Keep in mind most of these are really massacres — not really fair to call them battles.

The government’s also going to play a role in its assimilation policy. You can see that with the Dawes Severalty Act where Native Americans were forced to give up tribal ownership of land. Another area where the government plays a role is in economics. There’s huge amounts of land grants and subsidies given to the railroad companies, and of course the Homestead Act passed during the Civil War provides cheap land to anybody willing to live on it for 5 years.

Another important idea in period six is the policy of laissez-faire. This kind of government having a hands-off approach during the Gilded Age led to various social and political problems. And you could see those in economics where there’s the growth of trusts and monopolies. You have the lack of enforcement of laws that were passed during the time period such as the Interstate Commerce Act which was designed to regulate the railroads, and the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 which was designed to prevent and break up monopolies. Both of those had limited effectiveness during this Gilded Age.

Socially, you have the rise of urban slums. Poverty becomes a huge problem, and this is often times justified by those with money with the beliefs of social Darwinism — the survival of the fittest. The poor are poor because they are lazy and they deserve to be poor. You do see the rise of the settlement house movement in Chicago with Jane Addams and Hull House, but largely the government’s going to ignore this problem through much of this time period.

Political problems include the rise of political machines which were notoriously corrupt such as Tammany Hall and Boss Tweed in New York, and politics was very often a growing area of concern. And finally environmentally, you’re going to have the destruction of natural resources most famously the buffalo. And during this time you are going to see the growth of the conservationist movement — for example with the Sierra Club.

Make sure you know about the challenges facing both labor unions and farmers during the Gilded Age and how they attempted to address these challenges. We’re going to start with labor unions. There were a lot of challenges facing workers: they had hostility from both corporations and the government, there was division amongst themselves between skilled and unskilled workers, immigrant versus native born workers, and public opinion very often was against the unions — they were perceived as being radical.

The response of workers was to form unions. You have the Knights of Labor which focuses on both skilled and unskilled workers, the American Federation of Labor which focuses mainly on skilled workers headed by Samuel Gompers, and of course there are going to be a series of strikes such as the Homestead Strike in 1892 and the Pullman Strike in 1894. Both of those are going to end in violence and defeat for labor unions.

Farmers are also going to face their own share of challenges. There’s going to be the dominance of the railroads especially if you’re a small farmer, and the mechanization that was happening really pushed a lot of farmers to the brink of poverty. They are also going to respond in a variety of ways. They’re going to form organizations such as the Grange movement, and later on eventually in the 1890s you’re going to get the rise of a third party known as the Populist Party.

They’re going to call for reforms such as government regulation of the railroads — they want that Interstate Commerce Commission to be used effectively, they want to enforce that. They also demand the free coinage of silver and income tax, and they would like the direct election of senators.

Another important thing to keep in mind is how various groups continued to face discrimination during this time period. For African-Americans, post-Reconstruction was miserable in the South. You get Plessy versus Ferguson which legalizes Jim Crow laws. You have the widespread disenfranchisement — doesn’t matter about that 15th amendment — literacy tests, poll taxes, and other forms of denying the right to vote take place.

For immigrants, this was a period of rising nativism especially towards Asian and Chinese immigrants on the west coast. You get the Chinese Exclusion Act passed in 1882, and the new immigrants — those so-called new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe — were often times the victims of rising nativist sentiment.

Period 6 ends with the Spanish-American war in 1898 which is really a turning point in US foreign policy that we’ll take a look at in just a moment, which leads us to period 7.

Period 7 goes from 1890 to 1945. It’s a big old period — it takes up 17.7% of the exam — and it really begins in 1890 because this is seen as the closing of the frontier according to Turner’s Frontier Thesis. And of course, as already mentioned, it is the last of the major Native American wars with Wounded Knee.

Some important concepts to keep in mind are the motives of US overseas expansion and examples of that expansion. There’s a variety of reasons why the US is expanding during this time period. Not only is it the closing of the frontier, but you have economic motives — the desire for markets and raw materials. Political motives — competing with Europe and Japan over in Asia and other parts of the globe. Ideological motives — this desire to spread democracy and Christianity. And of course you have military motives articulated by people such as Alfred T. Mahan establishing naval bases around the world.

Lots of examples during this time period of US expansion: you have the Open Door Policy in China under President McKinley. The Spanish-American War is a huge turning point where the US acquires not only Cuba but Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. This leads to a brutal war between the US and the Philippines — a very controversial war where anti-imperialists condemn US foreign policy in the Philippines. You have the annexation of Hawaii also under McKinley, and the Panama Canal being built under Theodore Roosevelt’s rule.

Another important concept in Period 7 is the ways that the Progressive Movement sought to use the power of the government to improve society. There is a rejection of the laissez-faire approach of the Gilded Age. You see this in economics with trust-busting — Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson are all going to use the power of the Sherman Antitrust Act and other laws to break up powerful monopolies. You get the passage of the Meat Inspection Act, the Pure Food and Drug Act — all designed to protect the nation’s food and medicine — and the Hepburn Act which is passed to strengthen the Interstate Commerce Commission.

The Progressives also focus on political reforms — really the effort to expand democracy. You can see this really with the Wisconsin Idea, Robert La Follette with his reforms such as the recall, referendum, and initiative. These reforms spread across the country and eventually you get the 17th Amendment — something that the Populist Party was calling for earlier in the decade — which allows for the direct election of senators.

Don’t forget women are also playing a huge role in the Progressive Movement, and they’re fighting for various reforms but also for the 19th Amendment which will be achieved at the end of World War I. And there were also various social reforms amongst some Progressives such as advocates of temperance — eventually will get a victory with the 18th Amendment starting prohibition — and child labor laws would be advocated by people such as Lewis Hine.

No understanding of Period 7 would be complete without knowing why the US eventually went from neutrality to fighting in World War I, and how Woodrow Wilson played a key role in the peace process. So how do we get mixed up in this war? Well, the sinking of neutral ships such as the Lusitania, the news of the Zimmerman Telegram, and Wilson’s own idealism — he wanted to make the world safe for democracy, the war to end all wars — all contribute to US decision to enter World War I.

In the post-war period, Wilson’s going to play a key role. He’s going to articulate a vision in his 14 Points which is largely rejected by the other Allied Powers. He does get them to agree to the League of Nations, but his vision for the US involvement in the League of Nations is rejected by the US Senate. Make sure you know about the debate regarding the League of Nations.

World War I also had an impact on the home front. You should know a couple of examples, so let me give them to you: The Sedition Act greatly restricted civil liberties and it is upheld by the Schenck case. There’s a Great Migration of African-Americans to the North looking for economic opportunities, also trying to get the heck out of that Jim Crow South, which causes increased racial tensions in Northern cities. And really important — you see support increasing for the 18th and 19th Amendments as a result of World War I.

Make sure you know how the Roaring 20s was not only a decade of economic prosperity but it was also a time of increased tension in American society. It’s not just flappers and all that good stuff and jazz music. Some examples of tensions: you get the Red Scare, Palmer Raids to start off the decade — this fear of a Communist Revolution in the United States. You have the Quota Acts which are passed — the Immigration Quota Act of 1924 in particular — these are designed to keep out those so-called new immigrants. The Sacco and Vanzetti trial reveals the nativism and the anti-radical feelings of the 20s. The Scopes trial reveals the tension between fundamentalist and more secular thinking. And prohibition causes tension between rural and urban areas, religious and non-religious.

You also have the increased racial tensions as a result of African-Americans moving to Northern cities, but you have events such as the Harlem Renaissance instilling a new sense of racial pride. And finally you get a group of authors who are condemning the conformity and feeling a bit disillusioned in this post-war era. So know about these tensions that are right there below the surface throughout the 1920s.

A big moment is the Great Depression, and you should definitely pay attention to the ways the New Deal responded to the problems of the Great Depression under Franklin Roosevelt and changed the role of the federal government by creating programs intended to provide relief, recovery, and reform. The New Deal is going to continue some of those reforms of the Progressive Era, but it’s really responding to the problem of the Great Depression.

Some examples of the impact: Social Security passed in 1935 establishes the federal safety net for the American people — especially the elderly, women with dependent children, and the disabled. FDIC banking reform ensures people’s bank deposits. The Wagner Act which boosts labor unions by the federal government protecting their right to organize. And you get programs like the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps providing public works projects for the unemployed.

There were challenges to the New Deal: the Supreme Court ruled some programs unconstitutional — the NRA and the AAA. You had some people wanting to go further such as Huey Long with his Share Our Wealth program. And of course Republicans and conservatives oppose the deficit spending and the increase of the federal government under Roosevelt’s New Deal.

Finally in Period 7 you should also know about efforts of the US to remain neutral prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Just like before World War I, we tried to stay out of this war. Some examples of this can be seen in the Neutrality Acts which forbid us from sending weapons or money to any country at war. The America First Committee wanted Roosevelt to stay out of war — kept a lot of pressure on him limiting his help for the Allies. Cash and carry, and of course Lend-Lease Act.

World War II is going to have a huge impact on the home front — both good and bad. The Great Depression ends as a result of the mass mobilization of the economy for the war effort. The New Deal helps lessen the impact of the depression, but it is World War II which will actually end it.

People of Mexican descent are going to have different experiences: you’re going to have the Bracero Program which is going to allow them to come in and work largely in agriculture, but you’re going to see increased racial tension in places like Los Angeles during the Zoot Suit Riots.

For Japanese Americans, they’re going to suffer the ultimate injustice during World War II when Executive Order 9066 forcibly puts Japanese people and people of Japanese descent into internment camps throughout the West Coast. This is upheld by the Korematsu Supreme Court case as necessary for national security.

African-Americans have new opportunities in war factories, but there also is continued discrimination. You’re going to see various civil rights organizations calling for the Double Victory campaign — victory against racism at home and fascism abroad. You will see race riots once again happening in Northern cities. And as a result of threats by A. Philip Randolph, Executive Order 8802 is going to be passed and signed by Franklin Roosevelt banning discrimination in defense work.

You’re also going to see the growth of new civil rights organizations such as the Congress of Racial Equality continuing to put pressure on American society.

And finally in Period 7 you should know the reasons why the Allies defeated the Axis powers, and it’s really the military and political cooperation of Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin — the Big Three. US war production and new technologies such as sonar, and of course the big one under the Manhattan Project — the atomic bomb.

Period 7 ends with the end of World War II in 1945, and this is a major turning point in American history because we emerge from the war as a major superpower. I think it’s appropriate at this time to celebrate — we are back-to-back World War champs!

And that leads us to Period 8: 1945 to 1980. This bad boy is 15% of the exam, and it begins with the end of World War II and the US is a superpower — but we got lots of problems during this time period.

Make sure you know about the various methods the US used to try to contain Communism. This is George Kennan’s idea. We are throughout this period going to be in a Cold War against the Soviet Union. Some examples of containment can be seen in the Truman Doctrine — we’re giving lots of money to Greece and Turkey (they both don’t fall to the Communist). The Marshall Plan — we give a bunch of money to Europe to rebuild (they don’t fall to the Communist). The joining of NATO — this is the first time we are in a permanent peacetime alliance (forget George Washington’s advice at this point). And of course we’re going to have ourselves involved in some wars in Korea and Vietnam — one’s going to turn out okay, the other one not so much.

Although this period is a time of a Cold War, you should understand that the relationship between the US and the Soviets fluctuated between periods of confrontation and détente. Some examples of conflict can be seen in the Berlin Blockade and the Berlin Airlift in the late 1940s. Of course the Korean War — we’re shooting at people, that’s a big conflict. And the Cuban Missile Crisis where the whole world nearly ends (luckily Kennedy and Khrushchev negotiate).

Some examples of détente could be seen in the Spirit of Geneva during President Eisenhower’s administration — we start talking to the Soviet Union. Big détente moment happens with the SALT I treaty between the US and the Soviets under Nixon. And of course Nixon becomes the first president to go to China in 1972.

Sadly, you should also know about the ways the US supported undemocratic governments so long as they were non-communists. And you could see this really with the use of the CIA overthrowing democratically elected governments in both Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s. Dictatorships come to power in both countries. The US supports Diem in South Vietnam under President Kennedy — how he does not turn out so hot for us either. But as long as the governments were non-communists, we throw our support behind them.

The Cold War also led to growing debates at home. You see debates over the proper balance between order and liberty. You have the rise of the House Un-American Activities Committee calling people before them. Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism — you have a second Red Scare. And there were in fact some Communists such as Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs, but this leads to widespread paranoia and in many cases violations of people’s civil liberties.

There’s growing debates over the appropriateness of the arms race and the Space Race. Remember Eisenhower’s military-industrial complex where he warned the nation about the threat of too much military spending on domestic life. And remember when the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 — America freaks out and we start escalating our federal money to education especially math and science, and also the creation of NASA.

And the big debate’s going to come with regard to the Vietnam War. You’re going to see a growing anti-war movement especially after the Tet Offensive in 1968, news about the bombing of Cambodia, and news of the My Lai Massacre.

On the domestic front, civil rights activists used legal challenges, non-violence and direct action to fight segregation and discrimination. Some examples of this can be seen in the Brown versus Board of Education decision in which segregation is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 to 56. The freedom rides and Freedom Summer are all examples of direct action and nonviolence in the civil rights struggle.

You better know about the ways that the three branches of the government eventually played a role in advancing the cause of civil rights. Slowly but surely: the executive branch comes around when Truman desegregates the military in 1948. We saw the judicial branch doing its thing in 1954 Brown decision. And the legislative branch under LBJ’s Great Society passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banning segregation and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

In spite of this progress, there was intense resistance from Southerners and it slowed the pace of change. You could see this in the Southern Manifesto where over 100 southern congressmen condemned the Supreme Court’s Brown decision. And when Governor Orval Faubus tried to block the Little Rock Nine from attending high school in Arkansas.

As Southern resistance continued and social and economic inequality remained, disputes arose over the different philosophies for change. Some within the civil rights movement began to question the non-violent approach, and you get people like Stokely Carmichael advocating the Black Power movement, Malcolm X with the Nation of Islam, and the Black Panthers over in Oakland increasingly calling on African-Americans to arm themselves — black separatism and racial pride.

Other groups were inspired by the civil rights movement and there was a growing awareness of inequalities in American society. You could see this in the Mexican-American community as people like Cesar Chavez begin to organize. The LGBT movement with the Stonewall riots in 1969. The American Indian Movement forms in 1968. And various steps within the women’s rights movement with the publication of The Feminine Mystique, the National Organization for Women has founded it, and Roe versus Wade legalizes abortion.

Another important thing to keep in mind is liberalism under the Great Society. Lyndon Baines Johnson continues to expand the power of the federal government. They’re kind of continuing some of those reforms we saw during the Progressive Movement and the New Deal. You get a whole host of programs from the federal government such as Medicare, Medicaid, poverty programs such as Head Start, Job Corps, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Immigration Act of 1965 which ends quotas. All of these have varying degrees of success but they’re all under Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.

Even before and during the Great Society, you have the Warren Court led by Earl Warren. Those decisions expanded democracy and individual freedoms. So you get some key court cases such as Griswold versus Connecticut which legalizes birth control. Miranda versus Arizona which provides protection for individuals accused of a crime (so if you’re ever arrested, make sure they read you your Miranda rights).

Make sure you also know how the Great Society, the Warren Court decisions, and growing counterculture movements such as the hippies and the sexual revolution led to a resurgence of a conservative movement. You see Barry Goldwater run in 1964 against Johnson — he loses but he kind of really sparks this conservative movement. Nixon gets elected in 1968. And of course the big daddy of the conservative movement Ronald Reagan gets elected in 1980. And that’s exactly where Period 8 ends — the election of Ronald Reagan.

Which leads us to our last period — Period 9: it goes from 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan, the rise of conservatism, and it goes all the way until today. This is about 5% of the exam. There will not be any essays exclusively on this time period, but it’s always a good topic for synthesis.

So what are some key things to know about Period 9? You should know about the reasons for the rise of the conservative movement: belief in social and moral decay contributes to the rise of religious fundamentalists — they really mobilize around the issue of abortion and eventually gay marriage. There’s a reduced public faith in the government’s ability to solve social and economic problems — remember throughout the 70s there was high inflation, you have the Watergate crisis (although under Republican president), and the growing deficit of New Deal and Great Society programs really start to call into question the effectiveness of the federal government.

The conservatives under Reagan did achieve some political and economic victories but did not completely undo all government programs or social trends. What the heck does that mean? Well here are some conservative wins: Reaganomics — Reagan did manage to reduce taxes especially on the wealthy (this is part of his trickle-down theory of economics), and there was the deregulation of some industries. However, the size of the government grew under Reagan as programs that were very popular such as Social Security and Medicare continue to expand, and abortion continued to be legal in spite of many Christian fundamentalists wanting to ban it.

Another key part of this period is knowing about the rhetoric versus the reality of President Reagan’s foreign policy. In terms of his rhetoric, Reagan was a hardcore anti-communist — he called the Soviets the "evil empire," he rejected the policy of détente, and there was a mass increase in defense spending under Reagan (remember the Star Wars proposal). The reality was Reagan was homies with President Gorbachev, and this friendship eventually led to arms control agreements and the eventual end of the Soviet Union and thus the Cold War.

In spite of the end of the Cold War, it’s important to know that the post-Cold War world led to new challenges for US foreign policy makers. On 9/11 you had the horrible terrorist attacks, and this leads to a widespread war on terrorism which eventually leads to the war in Afghanistan. Under the Bush Doctrine, there was a preemptive strike against Iraq due to concerns over support for terrorism and the supposed program of weapons of mass destruction under Saddam Hussein. Both those things didn’t turn out very well. And with the war on terror, concerns over violations of civil liberties due to legislations such as the Patriot Act and government surveillance.

And finally, make sure you know about the changes to American society since the 1970s. You have changing demographics as increasing numbers of people come from Latin America and Asia (remember the Immigration Act of 1965 opens up the gates to lots of new people). We’re still debating this issue — immigration reform anybody? Continued debate over the role of the federal government — you have the health care law, Social Security spending, and government surveillance.

It’s important to note the loss of manufacturing jobs overseas and with that rising income inequality in the United States. You had the Occupy Wall Street movement bringing attention to this issue. And rising concerns about climate change, global warming, our energy policy and oil consumption. And this is really a throwback to all the periods from John Muir and the Sierra Club to TR’s conservation efforts during the Progressive Movement to Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in the 1960s which exposed the problem of pesticides to the passage of the Clean Air Act under the Great Society and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 under Nixon.

And wherever you are in the world, Period 9 ends with the present — which is the day of your APUSH exam.
