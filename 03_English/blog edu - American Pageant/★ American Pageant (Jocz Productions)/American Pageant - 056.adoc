== 释义

What's up 怎么了, beautiful people? Today in this video, we are going to walk you through 逐步讲解 the steps of writing both the LEQ 长论文题 or the DBQ 文档分析题 for any of your AP history classes. Now first piece of advice is gonna seem pretty obvious, but it's also very important, and step one is this -- you've got to read the prompt 题目要求. What is it saying? What is it asking? What historical thinking skill 历史思维能力 is it assessing 评估? And for this video in series of videos, we're gonna take a look at this prompt in detail. This is the question we're gonna use, and if you take a look at it, you could tell it's a comparison question 比较题.

Before we go any further, fun fact for you folks on the internet -- you might be wondering why in the heck am I telling you to read the question? You are an advanced placement 大学先修课程 student. Obviously you know you need to read the question, but you might not actually know that AP does not stand for advanced placement -- it stands for answer the prompt. And what a lot of students do -- a big mistake a lot of students do -- is they don't read the prompt correctly. So when I say read the prompt, I mean read the question, understand it, read it twice if necessary. And as you're reading it, mark every part of the question that you need to answer. Break this bad boy down 分解.

So let's take a look at the prompt we're going to be using. And so if you take a look at this prompt, it says: "Compare and contrast 比较对比 the development of the New England and the Chesapeake colonial regions." So as already mentioned, this is a comparison historical thinking skills type question. And you need to know what are they asking you -- is this an evaluate the extent 评估程度, is this causation 因果关系, continuity and change over time 延续与变化? Know what they are asking. So for this particular question, they want you to describe and explain the historical similarities and/or differences between the New England and Chesapeake colonial regions.

Now that ain't it, fam. There's more. This is AP. The second part of the question is: "Analyze the reasons that by 1700 the regions had evolved into two distinct societies 截然不同的社会." So that's why it's really important you read the prompt carefully, because you need to answer all parts of the question. So the second part of this question -- you need to address why the New England and the Chesapeake regions developed into two societies.

Now once you figure out what the prompt is asking, you want to start thinking about how you're gonna organize your thoughts. Sometimes it's simple -- they'll give you categories: analyze the social, religious, economic, political changes of a time period. And this one kind of you know gives you some idea -- you know you want to describe and explain the similarities between the two regions and also the differences. So perhaps you're gonna kind of put the information that you start thinking about into these two buckets 类别 or these two areas that you're gonna explore. But it's important to remember that's not all you're doing. You're also throughout your essay going to need to examine the reasons why they evolved into these two distinct societies.

The next step is you need to note the time frame 时间范围. This is super important. What is the time frame the question is asking you about? And so for this particular question, it says by 1700. So any information that you use to defend your thesis must take place before 1700. Anything after that won't count. So if you talk about the French and Indian War -- which I don't know why you would -- the First Great Awakening -- none of that is gonna get you any points for this particular essay. And usually they'll give you like a date range. And so they don't in this one -- they say by 1700 -- so you don't want to go past that date. But you know for this essay, it's safe to assume that you can talk about most things from 1607, which is the foundation of Jamestown. If you stick within this time frame, any information you use to try to prove your thesis would be eligible for 有资格获得 getting you points. So you don't want to go outside the time frame.

The next thing I recommend is you do a quick brainstorm 头脑风暴 of any outside information 外部信息. Whether or not you're doing an LEQ or a DBQ, start thinking about what do you know about this topic that you can kind of come up with. And so maybe when you first read it, you start thinking about these things. You don't really have any sense to them -- it's just information that is triggered when you think about Chesapeake or the New England colonies. Now you don't want to take too long on this, but with the quickness, jot down 快速记下 anything that you may think is relevant. And this may be useful when you're setting up contextualization 背景说明, your outside information, or even your thesis. Just as your process and the question, you're getting the brain doing any stuff.

Now if your brainstorm looks like this, you are in trouble. So if you can organize your brainstorm into categories -- you know whether it be similarities or differences between these two regions or social or political -- whatever the buckets or categories that you're using -- but you want a quick brainstorm now. And if you're turning it into this dude, you just want to move on. And so quick checklist -- within the first two to three minutes max -- I'm talking about you know in the first two to three minutes -- you want to read the prompt, break down the prompt, note the date range, brainstorm outside information. But like I said, no more than two to three minutes on this process.

Now if you are working on the DBQ -- which all you 2020 folks, that's only what you're gonna be doing -- you would then begin to read and annotate 注释 the document. And I'm going to be doing a separate video about how to approach the documents, how to use them as evidence. But assuming you have finished reading and annotating the documents or you're doing an LEQ, the question is now what do you do next? And that leads us to our next step is actually writing this essay and hopefully knocking the bad boy out 完成.

And the first thing most students write -- in the first point you really should get -- is your contextualization point. And so a quick little look at the rubric 评分标准 for contextualization -- here's what the College Board says about contextualization. Like I said, it should be your first point, and it describes a broader historical context 更广泛的历史背景 relevant to the prompt. And you can keep reading right there. And you're probably wondering what's up with the Star Wars crawl 滚动字幕? That's a good way of thinking about contextualization -- very similar to the Star Wars crawl. And what I mean by that is contextualization gives your reader the broader historical context that is relevant to the prompt. And if you've seen the first Star Wars -- A New Hope -- the opening crawl gives you all sorts of background info necessary to understanding the film. You know it's also similar to like how TV shows will oftentimes do "previously on." And if you read the crawl, basically you learn all this stuff that helps you the viewer make sense of what's been going down prior to the film. In this context provided by the crawl sets the scene for the movie to come. And without this context, you'd probably be hecka confused. And so that's what you really want to do for your contextualization.

Think of contextualization as setting up the scene 搭建场景. You're bringing the reader into your thesis statement 论点陈述 that you will make, and you're not just jumping right into your argument. You're setting the mood. And so contextualization -- a good way of thinking about it is it should go in your intro paragraph -- even though that's not a requirement -- that's just as good writing. And you should think of it like this -- you're starting broad to get the reader to your thesis. And contextualization should be around three to four sentences that connect to the broader events related to the prompt and your argument.

Now this can't be super vague 模糊的. You need to provide at least -- and probably more -- at least two specific examples -- historical details -- that help the reader understand the time frame that's relevant to the prompt. And you bring it in to your thesis statement. What it's not -- it is not just vague sentences that lack any specifics. You know you can't be super vague about the time period. You can't just say tensions were increasing, things were really bad, people united. That's that's not helpful, and it's not gonna get you any points. You need to offer the reader some details. You know likewise, it can't -- contextualization should not be super detailed information that does not connect to the prompt. The information that you give needs to be meaningful to the prompt.

So a lot of stuff happened before the prompt time period that we're looking at in this particular video -- 1700 -- but you're not going to get into a whole bunch of stuff about Columbus and you know his colonization and the Columbian Exchange. You know it's not really relevant to this particular prompt, although it is part of this bigger picture of colonization. It's not gonna get you any points for this particular essay.

The other thing to keep in mind is contextualization is not getting into evidence 证据 that answers the question. So if you're writing a DBQ, this is not the time to throw in your analysis of the documents. You don't want to get stuck in the weeds 陷入细节 here. You know don't give us everything you know about the foundation of Jamestown or the first Thanksgiving or Pocahontas's wardrobe. You want to set up the broader historical processes that are relevant to this prompt.

So let's take a look at a couple of examples. This one is not contextualization although the student tried to pass it off as such: "The British founded many colonies in the new world." And you know what -- that's not untrue, but it's super vague and it doesn't really show an understanding of the time period. If you keep reading, they also go on to say: "These colonies would eventually become the United States." And once again, they're not wrong, but none of this information has a meaningful connection to the prompt that we're looking at right there above, nor does it show an understanding of the historical process occurring before 1700. And so without those things, you don't get points.

They also go on to say that: "These regions would unite to fight the British in the American Revolution." That's correct but not relevant for this prompt. And the next part that they have is: "And they were established -- the colonies were established for different reasons and by different groups of people." Now here they're actually starting to answer the question that was asked, but once again, they don't really discuss the historical process occurring prior to 1700. You've got to have some events, some people, some moments to demonstrate you understand the big picture. And this particular attempt fails miserably.

So what's an example of contextualization that actually gets the points? Here is one for you: "England sought to compete with Spain and France for colonies in North America. While Spain was the first with the settlement of Saint Augustine, England would soon join the race for colonies with the establishment of Jamestown and Plymouth. Since colonization proved expensive, both colonies would be paid for by the establishment of joint stock companies 股份公司." Now this particular attempt does demonstrate an understanding of the big picture prior to 1700, and it does directly have relevance to the prompt. They provide way more than two specific historical details, and they do a really good job at kind of setting this essay up.

Let's take a look at another one: "England's colonization of North America with the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown. To encourage colonization, England offered charters 特许状 in the New World to prospective settlers, and various joint-stock companies were set up to help finance the high price of setting up a colony. As the mother country, England pursued colonization in an attempt to enrich the country as part of the economic theory of mercantilism 重商主义." Once again, this particular example does way more than you actually need to. They have way more than two specific examples. They do connect the events to the broader time period. And both of these would get the point without a doubt. Both of these are examples of contextualization championship responses.

So in your introductory paragraph, you should be able to get two points because after you write your contextualization, you should present your thesis. And if you take a look at the rubric, a thesis that gets the point responds to the prompt with a historically defensible 可辩护的 -- say with me folks -- historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning 推理思路. So you need to do those two things. It's a quick little check. A thesis that gets the point must directly answer all parts of the question. It must be historically defensible. You know you can use the language of the question in your thesis, but you must take a position. And you also must have a line of reasoning. You know you can call these your sub-claims 分论点 -- the buckets that you put your information in. This will become your topic sentences for your body paragraphs. So you're organizing your information, and you're having something that you're going to defend.

Now a thesis can't just restate 重申 the prompt. You can't just reword 改写 the prompt. Obviously you need to take a position. And if you don't have a line of reasoning, you will not get the points. So if we're thinking about that prompt we've been talking about, here's one attempt at a thesis. It says: "Before 1700, the New England and Chesapeake colonies developed differently in each region." Once again, they're not wrong, but they're just kind of restating the prompt. They're not taking a position, and they definitely do not have a line of reasoning. So no point there.

Another attempt: "There were many similarities and differences between the Chesapeake and New England colonies." This once again does not get a point because it doesn't do what it needs to do.

Here's a third one: "Before 1700, the New England and Chesapeake colonies developed differently in each region. The New England colonies were tight-knit religious communities 紧密联系的宗教社区, and the Chesapeake colonies were created for profit." Now I know a lot of you or maybe some of you are saying, "Oh that one -- that one has some meat on them bones." But that also would not get the point because it doesn't have a line of reasoning. It's not directly answering that second part of the question.

Now some folks like to use a thesis formula 论点公式, and two kind of popular ones is X however A, B, and C or sometimes just A and B therefore Y or although X, Y because A, B, C. And if your con -- what the heck? Basically this is what these formulas are meant to represent. So for instance, X would represent your counter-argument 反论点 -- the best counterpoint to your thesis. And then you would kind of present that. And then however A, B, and C -- these are your best kind of ideas or arguments to defend your thesis -- your line of reasoning. And then Y would be your thesis or your argument.

So how does one of these formulas look if you actually put it into action? So for instance, this would be an example using the formula above: "Although both the New England and Chesapeake regions faced difficulties with the indigenous people and were under the mercantile system 商业体系" -- this would be kind of a counter argument -- "they have some similarities, the motives for colonization, the characteristics of the colonists, and the geography of the region contributed to the New England area evolving into tight-knit religious community and the Chesapeake region into a cash crop reliant society 依赖经济作物的社会 with numerous economic and racial tensions." So here you see the line of reasoning represented by A, B, and C -- once again it can maybe just be two things -- but this particular person wrote three. And then Y being the argument. This would be an example of a thesis statement that would not only get the point but also presents that counter-argument which can help you get the complexity point 复杂性得分 later on. And we'll get into that in the next video.

Now chances are under stress, a lot of you folks are going to abandon this formula. This type of thinking and all of your writing skills are gonna collapse faster than France did during World War Two. But if you want to try something like that, here's kind of a model that many people have used with success. On the other hand, you don't have to be a great writer to get the thesis point or to do well on the DBQ. All of these -- and you can hit pause if you want to read them -- or examples of thesis statements responding to the question that we've been looking at. All of them got the full point. And so grammar, punctuation errors don't necessarily count against you. And all of these things -- thesis statements -- some of them have more than one sentence, some of them have grammatical errors, they don't follow a formula. They all got the point because they do what a good thesis statement does. They directly answer all parts of the question. They're historically defensible, and they have a line of reasoning. It doesn't need to look pretty, but you can get it done.

And that's why it's so important that you get those two points in your introductory paragraph where you knock out your contextualization, you have a really solid thesis that also has a counter-argument embedded in it. So you're set up for getting the complexity point a little bit later and having a great intro paragraph really sets you up for success throughout the rest of your essay.

Now regardless of formulas and writing, I can't stress this enough -- knowing your content is so important. You can't defend or have an argument if you don't know the history. So that's why at APUSHExplained.com, we got all sorts of videos that break down the key concepts and the content in a way that hopefully will make it easier for you on your exam. Thank you for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，各位！今天的视频中，我们将带你们逐步了解如何为任何AP历史课程撰写LEQ（长篇论文题）或DBQ（文献分析题）。首先，我要给出的建议看起来很明显，但它也非常重要，第一步就是——你们必须阅读题目。它在说什么？它在问什么？它在评估哪种历史思维技能？在本视频系列中，我们将详细分析这个题目。这是我们将要使用的题目，如果你看一下，你会发现这是一个比较题。

在我们继续之前，给互联网上的各位一个有趣的事实——你们可能想知道我为什么让你们阅读问题？你们是大学预科课程的学生。显然你们知道需要阅读问题，但你们可能不知道AP实际上不是“高级课程”（Advanced Placement）的缩写——它代表“回答问题”（Answer the Prompt）。很多学生——很多学生常犯的一个大错误——就是他们没有正确地阅读题目。所以当我让你们阅读题目时，我的意思是阅读问题，理解它，必要时读两遍。在阅读时，标记出你需要回答问题的每一个部分。彻底分析这个问题。

现在让我们看一下我们将要使用的题目。如果你看一下这个题目，它说：“比较和对比新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地区的发展。”正如已经提到的，这是一个考察比较历史思维技能的问题。你需要知道他们在问你什么——这是一个评估程度的问题吗？是因果关系问题？还是随着时间的推移的连续性和变化问题？了解他们问的是什么。对于这个问题，他们希望你描述和解释新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地区之间历史上的相似之处和/或不同之处。

但这还没完，朋友们。还有更多。这是AP。问题的第二部分是：“分析到1700年这两个地区发展成为两个截然不同的社会的原因。”这就是为什么仔细阅读题目非常重要，因为你需要回答问题的各个部分。所以这个问题的第二部分——你需要说明为什么新英格兰和切萨皮克地区发展成为两个不同的社会。

一旦你弄清楚题目在问什么，你就要开始思考如何组织你的想法。有时很简单——他们会给你类别：分析某个时期的社会、宗教、经济、政治变化。而这个问题在某种程度上给你一些想法——你知道你需要描述和解释这两个地区之间的相似之处以及不同之处。所以也许你会把你开始思考的信息放到这两个“桶”或这两个你将要探索的领域中。但重要的是要记住，这并不是你所做的全部。在你的整个文章中，你还需要考察它们发展成为这两个不同社会的原因。

下一步你需要注意时间范围。这非常重要。问题询问的时间范围是什么？对于这个问题，它说是“到1700年”。所以你用来支持你论点的任何信息都必须发生在1700年之前。之后的任何信息都无效。所以如果你谈论法国-印第安战争——我不知道你为什么会那样做——第一次大觉醒——这些都不会让你的这篇文章得到任何分数。通常他们会给你一个日期范围。但这个问题没有——它说“到1700年”——所以你不想超过那个日期。但你知道，对于这篇文章，你可以安全地假设你可以谈论1607年之后的大部分事情，那是詹姆斯敦建立的时间。如果你坚持在这个时间范围内，你用来证明你的论点的任何信息都有资格获得分数。所以你不想超出时间范围。

我建议的下一步是对任何外部信息进行快速的头脑风暴。无论你是在写LEQ还是DBQ，都开始思考你对这个主题了解什么，你可以想到什么。所以也许当你第一次读到它时，你开始思考这些事情。你对它们没有任何概念——这只是当你想到切萨皮克或新英格兰殖民地时触发的信息。现在你不想在这上面花费太长时间，但要快速地记下你认为可能相关的任何东西。这在你设置背景化、你的外部信息，甚至你的论点时可能很有用。就像你的过程和问题一样，你让大脑开始运转。

如果你的头脑风暴看起来像这样，你就麻烦了。所以如果你能把你的头脑风暴分成几类——无论是这两个地区之间的相似之处还是不同之处，还是社会或政治——无论你使用什么“桶”或类别——但你现在需要一个快速的头脑风暴。如果你把它变成这样，你只想继续前进。所以快速检查清单——最多在最初的两到三分钟内——我说的是在最初的两到三分钟内——你想阅读题目，分析题目，注意日期范围，头脑风暴外部信息。但正如我所说，这个过程不要超过两到三分钟。

现在，如果你正在做DBQ——你们2020年的各位，这将是你们唯一要做的——那么你将开始阅读并注释文件。我将单独制作一个关于如何处理文件、如何将它们用作证据的视频。但假设你已经完成了阅读和注释文件，或者你正在做LEQ，现在的问题是你接下来做什么？这就引出了我们的下一步，实际上是撰写这篇文章，并希望能够顺利完成它。

大多数学生写的第一件事——也是你们真正应该获得的第一分——是你们的背景化得分。所以快速看一下背景化的评分标准——大学理事会是这样描述背景化的。正如我所说，它应该是你的第一分，它描述了与问题相关的更广泛的历史背景。你可以继续阅读那里。你可能想知道“星球大战”的开场字幕是怎么回事？那是思考背景化的一个好方法——非常类似于“星球大战”的开场字幕。我的意思是，背景化为你的读者提供了与问题相关的更广泛的历史背景。如果你看过第一部“星球大战”——《新希望》——开场字幕提供了理解这部电影所需的所有背景信息。你知道，它也类似于电视节目经常做的“此前剧情提要”。如果你阅读字幕，基本上你会了解所有这些信息，这些信息帮助你观众理解电影之前发生的事情。开场字幕提供的背景为即将到来的电影奠定了基础。没有这个背景，你可能会非常困惑。所以这才是你真正想要为你的背景化所做的事情。

把背景化看作是设置场景。你正在引导读者进入你将要提出的论点陈述，而你不仅仅是直接进入你的论证。你正在营造气氛。所以背景化——思考它的一个好方法是它应该放在你的引言段落中——即使这不是一个要求——这只是好的写作方式。你应该这样想——你从宏观开始，引导读者走向你的论点。背景化应该大约三到四句话，与和问题及你的论点相关的更广泛的事件联系起来。

现在这不能过于模糊。你需要提供至少——可能更多——至少两个具体的例子——历史细节——帮助读者理解与问题相关的时间范围。你把它带入你的论点陈述。它不是什么——它不是缺乏任何具体内容的模糊句子。你知道你不能对时间段过于模糊。你不能仅仅说紧张局势正在加剧，情况非常糟糕，人们团结起来。这没有帮助，也不会让你得到任何分数。你需要给读者一些细节。同样，它也不能——背景化不应该是与问题无关的过于详细的信息。你提供的信息需要对问题有意义。

所以在我们在这段视频中讨论的问题时间段（1700年）之前发生了很多事情——但你不会深入探讨关于哥伦布和他殖民化以及哥伦布大交换的很多内容。你知道，它与这个问题并不真正相关，尽管它是更大的殖民化图景的一部分。它不会让你在这篇文章中得到任何分数。

另一个需要记住的是，背景化不是提供回答问题的证据。所以如果你在写DBQ，这不是插入你对文件的分析的时候。你不想在这里陷入细节。你知道，不要告诉我们你所知道的关于詹姆斯敦的建立、第一次感恩节或波卡洪塔斯的衣橱的所有信息。你想建立与这个问题相关的更广泛的历史进程。

让我们看几个例子。这个不是背景化，尽管学生试图把它当作背景化：“英国在新世界建立了许多殖民地。”你知道——这并非不实，但它非常模糊，并没有真正显示出对这个时期的理解。如果你继续阅读，他们还说：“这些殖民地最终将成为美国。”再一次，他们没有错，但这些信息都与我们上面看到的这个问题没有有意义的联系，也没有显示出对1700年之前发生的历史进程的理解。所以没有这些，你就得不到分数。

他们还接着说：“这些地区将联合起来在美国独立战争中对抗英国人。”这是正确的，但与这个问题无关。他们接下来的部分是：“它们被建立——这些殖民地是由于不同的原因和由不同的人群建立的。”现在他们实际上开始回答被提出的问题，但再一次，他们并没有真正讨论1700年之前发生的历史进程。你必须有一些事件、一些人、一些时刻来证明你理解大局。而这个特定的尝试彻底失败了。

那么，一个真正能得分的背景化例子是什么呢？这里有一个给你：“英国试图与西班牙和法国争夺北美洲的殖民地。虽然西班牙是第一个建立圣奥古斯丁定居点的国家，但英国很快就会加入殖民地的竞争，建立詹姆斯敦和普利茅斯。由于殖民化成本高昂，这两个殖民地都将通过建立股份公司来支付费用。”这个例子确实展示了对1700年之前大局的理解，并且它与问题直接相关。他们提供了远远超过两个具体的历史细节，并且他们在构建这篇文章方面做得非常好。

让我们看另一个例子：“英国对北美洲的殖民化始于在詹姆斯敦建立的第一个永久性英国定居点。为了鼓励殖民化，英国向潜在的定居者提供了在新世界的特许状，并成立了各种股份公司来帮助支付建立殖民地的高昂费用。作为母国，英国为了丰富国家，作为重商主义经济理论的一部分，追求殖民化。”再一次，这个特定的例子做得远远超过你实际需要的。他们提供了远远超过两个具体的例子。他们确实将这些事件与更广泛的时期联系起来。毫无疑问，这两个例子都能得分。这两个都是背景化冠军级别的回答。

所以在你的引言段落中，你应该能够获得两分，因为在你写完背景化之后，你应该提出你的论点。如果你看一下评分标准，一个能得分的论点会针对问题提出一个在历史上站得住脚的——大家跟我一起说——在历史上站得住脚的论点或主张，并确立一个论证思路。所以你需要做这两件事。这是一个快速的检查。一个能得分的论点必须直接回答问题的各个部分。它必须在历史上站得住脚。你知道你可以在你的论点中使用问题的措辞，但你必须采取立场。而且你还必须有一个论证思路。你知道你可以称这些为你的次级论点——你用来组织信息的“桶”。这将成为你主体段落的主题句。所以你正在组织你的信息，并且你有一些你将要捍卫的东西。

现在一个论点不能仅仅重述问题。你不能仅仅改写问题。显然你需要采取立场。如果你没有论证思路，你就不会得分。所以如果我们思考我们一直在讨论的那个问题，这里有一个论点尝试。它说：“在1700年之前，新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地在每个地区的发展都不同。”再一次，他们没有错，但他们只是在某种程度上重述了问题。他们没有采取立场，而且他们肯定没有论证思路。所以没有分数。

另一个尝试：“切萨皮克和新英格兰殖民地之间有很多相似之处和不同之处。”这再一次没有得分，因为它没有做到它需要做的事情。

这是第三个：“在1700年之前，新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地在每个地区的发展都不同。新英格兰殖民地是紧密的宗教社区，而切萨皮克殖民地是为了盈利而建立的。”现在我知道你们中的很多人或者也许有些人会说：“哦，那个——那个有一些实质内容。”但那也不会得分，因为它没有论证思路。它没有直接回答问题的第二部分。

现在有些人喜欢使用论点公式，两个比较流行的公式是X然而A、B和C，或者有时只是A和B因此Y，或者尽管X，Y因为A、B、C。如果你的结论——这到底是什么？基本上，这些公式旨在代表这个。例如，X将代表你的反驳论点——对你的论点最好的反驳点。然后你会提出它。然后然而A、B和C——这些是你捍卫你的论点——你的论证思路的最佳想法或论据。然后Y将是你的论点或你的主张。

那么，如果你实际应用其中一个公式，它会是什么样子呢？例如，这将是使用上述公式的一个例子：“尽管新英格兰和切萨皮克地区都面临着与当地居民的困难，并且都处于重商主义体系之下”——这将是一种反驳论点——“它们有一些相似之处，但殖民的动机、殖民者的特点以及该地区的地理环境促成了新英格兰地区发展成为紧密的宗教社区，而切萨皮克地区发展成为一个依赖经济作物、存在众多经济和种族紧张关系的社会。”在这里，你看到了由A、B和C代表的论证思路——再一次，它可能只有两件事——但这个人写了三个。然后Y是论点。这将是一个论点陈述的例子，它不仅能得分，而且还提出了反驳论点，这可以帮助你稍后获得复杂性得分。我们将在下一个视频中讨论这个问题。

现在，很可能在压力下，你们中的很多人会放弃这个公式。这种思维方式和你们所有的写作技巧都会比二战期间的法国崩溃得更快。但如果你想尝试类似的方法，这里有一个很多人成功使用的模型。另一方面，你不需要成为一个伟大的作家才能获得论点分数或在DBQ中取得好成绩。所有这些——如果你想阅读，可以暂停视频——都是回应我们一直在讨论的问题的论点陈述的例子。所有这些都获得了满分。所以语法、标点错误不一定对你不利。所有这些——论点陈述——有些不止一句话，有些有语法错误，它们没有遵循公式。它们都得了分，因为它们做了一个好的论点陈述所做的事情。它们直接回答了问题的各个部分。它们在历史上站得住脚，并且有论证思路。它不需要看起来很漂亮，但你可以完成它。

这就是为什么在你的引言段落中获得那两分如此重要，你在那里完成了你的背景化，你有一个非常扎实的论点，其中还嵌入了一个反驳论点。所以你为稍后获得复杂性得分做好了准备，并且有一个好的引言段落真正为你整篇文章的成功奠定了基础。

现在，无论公式和写作如何，我怎么强调都不为过——了解你的内容非常重要。如果你不了解历史，你就无法捍卫或提出论点。https://www.google.com/search?q=%E6%89%80%E4%BB%A5%E8%BF%99%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%BA%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E5%9C%A8APUSHExplained.com，我们有各种各样的视频，以一种希望对你的考试有所帮助的方式分解关键概念和内容。感谢你的观看。祝你度过美好的一天。再见！

What's up, beautiful people? Today in this video, we are going to walk you through the steps of writing both the LEQ or the DBQ for any of your AP history classes. Now first piece of advice is gonna seem pretty obvious, but it's also very important, and step one is this -- you've got to read the prompt. What is it saying? What is it asking? What historical thinking skill is it assessing? And for this video in series of videos, we're gonna take a look at this prompt in detail. This is the question we're gonna use, and if you take a look at it, you could tell it's a comparison question.

Before we go any further, fun fact for you folks on the internet -- you might be wondering why in the heck am I telling you to read the question? You are an advanced placement student. Obviously you know you need to read the question, but you might not actually know that AP does not stand for advanced placement -- it stands for answer the prompt. And what a lot of students do -- a big mistake a lot of students do -- is they don't read the prompt correctly. So when I say read the prompt, I mean read the question, understand it, read it twice if necessary. And as you're reading it, mark every part of the question that you need to answer. Break this bad boy down.

So let's take a look at the prompt we're going to be using. And so if you take a look at this prompt, it says: "Compare and contrast the development of the New England and the Chesapeake colonial regions." So as already mentioned, this is a comparison historical thinking skills type question. And you need to know what are they asking you -- is this an evaluate the extent, is this causation, continuity and change over time? Know what they are asking. So for this particular question, they want you to describe and explain the historical similarities and/or differences between the New England and Chesapeake colonial regions.

Now that ain't it, fam. There's more. This is AP. The second part of the question is: "Analyze the reasons that by 1700 the regions had evolved into two distinct societies." So that's why it's really important you read the prompt carefully, because you need to answer all parts of the question. So the second part of this question -- you need to address why the New England and the Chesapeake regions developed into two societies.

Now once you figure out what the prompt is asking, you want to start thinking about how you're gonna organize your thoughts. Sometimes it's simple -- they'll give you categories: analyze the social, religious, economic, political changes of a time period. And this one kind of you know gives you some idea -- you know you want to describe and explain the similarities between the two regions and also the differences. So perhaps you're gonna kind of put the information that you start thinking about into these two buckets or these two areas that you're gonna explore. But it's important to remember that's not all you're doing. You're also throughout your essay going to need to examine the reasons why they evolved into these two distinct societies.

The next step is you need to note the time frame. This is super important. What is the time frame the question is asking you about? And so for this particular question, it says by 1700. So any information that you use to defend your thesis must take place before 1700. Anything after that won't count. So if you talk about the French and Indian War -- which I don't know why you would -- the First Great Awakening -- none of that is gonna get you any points for this particular essay. And usually they'll give you like a date range. And so they don't in this one -- they say by 1700 -- so you don't want to go past that date. But you know for this essay, it's safe to assume that you can talk about most things from 1607, which is the foundation of Jamestown. If you stick within this time frame, any information you use to try to prove your thesis would be eligible for getting you points. So you don't want to go outside the time frame.

The next thing I recommend is you do a quick brainstorm of any outside information. Whether or not you're doing an LEQ or a DBQ, start thinking about what do you know about this topic that you can kind of come up with. And so maybe when you first read it, you start thinking about these things. You don't really have any sense to them -- it's just information that is triggered when you think about Chesapeake or the New England colonies. Now you don't want to take too long on this, but with the quickness, jot down anything that you may think is relevant. And this may be useful when you're setting up contextualization, your outside information, or even your thesis. Just as your process and the question, you're getting the brain doing any stuff.

Now if your brainstorm looks like this, you are in trouble. So if you can organize your brainstorm into categories -- you know whether it be similarities or differences between these two regions or social or political -- whatever the buckets or categories that you're using -- but you want a quick brainstorm now. And if you're turning it into this dude, you just want to move on. And so quick checklist -- within the first two to three minutes max -- I'm talking about you know in the first two to three minutes -- you want to read the prompt, break down the prompt, note the date range, brainstorm outside information. But like I said, no more than two to three minutes on this process.

Now if you are working on the DBQ -- which all you 2020 folks, that's only what you're gonna be doing -- you would then begin to read and annotate the document. And I'm going to be doing a separate video about how to approach the documents, how to use them as evidence. But assuming you have finished reading and annotating the documents or you're doing an LEQ, the question is now what do you do next? And that leads us to our next step is actually writing this essay and hopefully knocking the bad boy out.

And the first thing most students write -- in the first point you really should get -- is your contextualization point. And so a quick little look at the rubric for contextualization -- here's what the College Board says about contextualization. Like I said, it should be your first point, and it describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. And you can keep reading right there. And you're probably wondering what's up with the Star Wars crawl? That's a good way of thinking about contextualization -- very similar to the Star Wars crawl. And what I mean by that is contextualization gives your reader the broader historical context that is relevant to the prompt. And if you've seen the first Star Wars -- A New Hope -- the opening crawl gives you all sorts of background info necessary to understanding the film. You know it's also similar to like how TV shows will oftentimes do "previously on." And if you read the crawl, basically you learn all this stuff that helps you the viewer make sense of what's been going down prior to the film. In this context provided by the crawl sets the scene for the movie to come. And without this context, you'd probably be hecka confused. And so that's what you really want to do for your contextualization.

Think of contextualization as setting up the scene. You're bringing the reader into your thesis statement that you will make, and you're not just jumping right into your argument. You're setting the mood. And so contextualization -- a good way of thinking about it is it should go in your intro paragraph -- even though that's not a requirement -- that's just as good writing. And you should think of it like this -- you're starting broad to get the reader to your thesis. And contextualization should be around three to four sentences that connect to the broader events related to the prompt and your argument.

Now this can't be super vague. You need to provide at least -- and probably more -- at least two specific examples -- historical details -- that help the reader understand the time frame that's relevant to the prompt. And you bring it in to your thesis statement. What it's not -- it is not just vague sentences that lack any specifics. You know you can't be super vague about the time period. You can't just say tensions were increasing, things were really bad, people united. That's that's not helpful, and it's not gonna get you any points. You need to offer the reader some details. You know likewise, it can't -- contextualization should not be super detailed information that does not connect to the prompt. The information that you give needs to be meaningful to the prompt.

So a lot of stuff happened before the prompt time period that we're looking at in this particular video -- 1700 -- but you're not going to get into a whole bunch of stuff about Columbus and you know his colonization and the Columbian Exchange. You know it's not really relevant to this particular prompt, although it is part of this bigger picture of colonization. It's not gonna get you any points for this particular essay.

The other thing to keep in mind is contextualization is not getting into evidence that answers the question. So if you're writing a DBQ, this is not the time to throw in your analysis of the documents. You don't want to get stuck in the weeds here. You know don't give us everything you know about the foundation of Jamestown or the first Thanksgiving or Pocahontas's wardrobe. You want to set up the broader historical processes that are relevant to this prompt.

So let's take a look at a couple of examples. This one is not contextualization although the student tried to pass it off as such: "The British founded many colonies in the new world." And you know what -- that's not untrue, but it's super vague and it doesn't really show an understanding of the time period. If you keep reading, they also go on to say: "These colonies would eventually become the United States." And once again, they're not wrong, but none of this information has a meaningful connection to the prompt that we're looking at right there above, nor does it show an understanding of the historical process occurring before 1700. And so without those things, you don't get points.

They also go on to say that: "These regions would unite to fight the British in the American Revolution." That's correct but not relevant for this prompt. And the next part that they have is: "And they were established -- the colonies were established for different reasons and by different groups of people." Now here they're actually starting to answer the question that was asked, but once again, they don't really discuss the historical process occurring prior to 1700. You've got to have some events, some people, some moments to demonstrate you understand the big picture. And this particular attempt fails miserably.

So what's an example of contextualization that actually gets the points? Here is one for you: "England sought to compete with Spain and France for colonies in North America. While Spain was the first with the settlement of Saint Augustine, England would soon join the race for colonies with the establishment of Jamestown and Plymouth. Since colonization proved expensive, both colonies would be paid for by the establishment of joint stock companies." Now this particular attempt does demonstrate an understanding of the big picture prior to 1700, and it does directly have relevance to the prompt. They provide way more than two specific historical details, and they do a really good job at kind of setting this essay up.

Let's take a look at another one: "England's colonization of North America with the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown. To encourage colonization, England offered charters in the New World to prospective settlers, and various joint-stock companies were set up to help finance the high price of setting up a colony. As the mother country, England pursued colonization in an attempt to enrich the country as part of the economic theory of mercantilism." Once again, this particular example does way more than you actually need to. They have way more than two specific examples. They do connect the events to the broader time period. And both of these would get the point without a doubt. Both of these are examples of contextualization championship responses.

So in your introductory paragraph, you should be able to get two points because after you write your contextualization, you should present your thesis. And if you take a look at the rubric, a thesis that gets the point responds to the prompt with a historically defensible -- say with me folks -- historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. So you need to do those two things. It's a quick little check. A thesis that gets the point must directly answer all parts of the question. It must be historically defensible. You know you can use the language of the question in your thesis, but you must take a position. And you also must have a line of reasoning. You know you can call these your sub-claims -- the buckets that you put your information in. This will become your topic sentences for your body paragraphs. So you're organizing your information, and you're having something that you're going to defend.

Now a thesis can't just restate the prompt. You can't just reword the prompt. Obviously you need to take a position. And if you don't have a line of reasoning, you will not get the points. So if we're thinking about that prompt we've been talking about, here's one attempt at a thesis. It says: "Before 1700, the New England and Chesapeake colonies developed differently in each region." Once again, they're not wrong, but they're just kind of restating the prompt. They're not taking a position, and they definitely do not have a line of reasoning. So no point there.

Another attempt: "There were many similarities and differences between the Chesapeake and New England colonies." This once again does not get a point because it doesn't do what it needs to do.

Here's a third one: "Before 1700, the New England and Chesapeake colonies developed differently in each region. The New England colonies were tight-knit religious communities, and the Chesapeake colonies were created for profit." Now I know a lot of you or maybe some of you are saying, "Oh that one -- that one has some meat on them bones." But that also would not get the point because it doesn't have a line of reasoning. It's not directly answering that second part of the question.

Now some folks like to use a thesis formula, and two kind of popular ones is X however A, B, and C or sometimes just A and B therefore Y or although X, Y because A, B, C. And if your con -- what the heck? Basically this is what these formulas are meant to represent. So for instance, X would represent your counter-argument -- the best counterpoint to your thesis. And then you would kind of present that. And then however A, B, and C -- these are your best kind of ideas or arguments to defend your thesis -- your line of reasoning. And then Y would be your thesis or your argument.

So how does one of these formulas look if you actually put it into action? So for instance, this would be an example using the formula above: "Although both the New England and Chesapeake regions faced difficulties with the indigenous people and were under the mercantile system" -- this would be kind of a counter argument -- "they have some similarities, the motives for colonization, the characteristics of the colonists, and the geography of the region contributed to the New England area evolving into tight-knit religious community and the Chesapeake region into a cash crop reliant society with numerous economic and racial tensions." So here you see the line of reasoning represented by A, B, and C -- once again it can maybe just be two things -- but this particular person wrote three. And then Y being the argument. This would be an example of a thesis statement that would not only get the point but also presents that counter-argument which can help you get the complexity point later on. And we'll get into that in the next video.

Now chances are under stress, a lot of you folks are going to abandon this formula. This type of thinking and all of your writing skills are gonna collapse faster than France did during World War Two. But if you want to try something like that, here's kind of a model that many people have used with success. On the other hand, you don't have to be a great writer to get the thesis point or to do well on the DBQ. All of these -- and you can hit pause if you want to read them -- or examples of thesis statements responding to the question that we've been looking at. All of them got the full point. And so grammar, punctuation errors don't necessarily count against you. And all of these things -- thesis statements -- some of them have more than one sentence, some of them have grammatical errors, they don't follow a formula. They all got the point because they do what a good thesis statement does. They directly answer all parts of the question. They're historically defensible, and they have a line of reasoning. It doesn't need to look pretty, but you can get it done.

And that's why it's so important that you get those two points in your introductory paragraph where you knock out your contextualization, you have a really solid thesis that also has a counter-argument embedded in it. So you're set up for getting the complexity point a little bit later and having a great intro paragraph really sets you up for success throughout the rest of your essay.

Now regardless of formulas and writing, I can't stress this enough -- knowing your content is so important. You can't defend or have an argument if you don't know the history. So that's why at APUSHExplained.com, we got all sorts of videos that break down the key concepts and the content in a way that hopefully will make it easier for you on your exam. Thank you for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!
