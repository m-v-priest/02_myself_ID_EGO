Greetings, internet people. Today we're taking a look at the events of the 1960s 二十世纪六十年代, covering what went down during JFK and LBJ's administration 肯尼迪和约翰逊政府. If you're studying for APUSH, those are some of the books and how this video lines up to them.

So we're going to start off with JFK. And remember the election of 1960 -- JFK's running against the vice president Richard Nixon. And this is an important election because it's the first time candidates face off 对抗 on television in a series of debates 辩论. And most people say Kennedy wins the television debate -- he looks good, he has a swagger 自信 to him, whereas Nixon is pale and pasty 苍白的 and has the 5:00 shadow 胡茬. So this begins the transformation of American politics and TV's role in it.

Kennedy is the first Catholic president 天主教总统 elected. Remember in 1928 we saw Al Smith running and that issue really kind of played a key role in the election. Kennedy breaks through that barrier 打破障碍 and becomes the first Catholic president. President Kennedy runs on a domestic program known as the New Frontier 新边疆政策, and really he wants federal money to education, health care programs, civil rights, etc. But he doesn't really have a decisive win 决定性胜利 -- he only wins by a little more than 100,000 votes over Nixon. So he's going to be limited in what he's going to be able to accomplish domestically.

In fact, most of his domestic agenda 国内议程 will be blocked by Congress and overshadowed 被掩盖 by concerns over foreign affairs. He is going to openly call on the nation to be the first to put a man on the moon. He gives a really passionate speech, and you know during Kennedy's administration the space race 太空竞赛 is going to continue. Billions of dollars will be spent, this will help the economy, and in 1969 the United States will be the first country to put a man on the moon.

Kennedy also creates the Peace Corps 和平队, which is created to send Americans to underdeveloped countries 欠发达国家 to help out. Now the Cold War continues under Kennedy -- it's going to be a reality of life under JFK. The new Soviet leader during his administration is Nikita Khrushchev, and those two men are going to be competing for influence around the world.

Kennedy does oversee in 1961 the creation of the Alliance for Progress 进步联盟. It's an economic development program 经济发展计划 for Latin America. You know some people call it the Marshall Plan 马歇尔计划 for Latin America. It has limited results. Big important event is the Bay of Pigs invasion 猪湾事件 in Latin America. JFK approves of his CIA plan that was actually planned under President Eisenhower's administration in which the US -- the CIA -- would train Cuban exiles 古巴流亡者 to overthrow the Castro government. They would land at the Bay of Pigs, and the hope would be that the Cuban people would rise up 起义 and remove Castro.

The invasion is a complete failure as the Cuban exiles land in the Bay of Pigs in 1961 and no uprising comes to their support. In fact, Castro easily crushes the rebellion 镇压叛乱. It's a huge embarrassment 难堪 for JFK -- it blows up in his face 适得其反. And since the US does not send support, the invasion was doomed to failure 注定失败. And as a result of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Castro and Khrushchev -- the Cubans and the Soviets -- move closer together.

In a completely unrelated event, the Soviet Union begins construction of the Berlin Wall 柏林墙 in East Germany in 1961. And really the goal of the Berlin Wall is to keep East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. And you could see Kennedy visiting the West Berlin side of that wall and pledging US support for West Berlin.

A big moment of Kennedy's presidency is the Cuban Missile Crisis 古巴导弹危机 in 1962. In October, US U-2 spy planes 侦察机 discover that the Soviets were installing offensive nuclear weapons 进攻性核武器 inside of Cuba. These weapons were capable of hitting most American cities and could kill millions of Americans in minutes. And you can see on the map some of those cities and times. Kennedy orders a naval blockade 海军封锁 of Cuba -- he calls it a quarantine 隔离 because a blockade is technically an act of war -- and he's trying to pressure the Soviets to remove the missiles.

This is a very tense situation and it's the closest that the two sides ever came to a potential nuclear war 核战争. Kennedy and Khrushchev are in a tense standoff 紧张对峙. There's all sorts of "what ifs" in this situation -- what if the Soviets run the blockade? Would the US shoot and engage in battle? The advisers of JFK overwhelmingly were telling him to attack before the missiles become operational. We now know that those missiles were already operational, and if Kennedy would have attacked it could have been really really bad.

Khrushchev eventually after a tense standoff agrees to remove the missiles, and a couple of things are reached in a deal. Kennedy promises that we will not try to invade Cuba, and the US would later on -- 6 months later -- remove US missiles from Turkey that were pointed at the Soviet Union.

The impact of the Cuban Missile Crisis: they installed a hotline 热线 between DC and Moscow so that we can communicate instantly to try to prevent a future crisis, and it increases calls for relaxing of tensions -- détente 缓和. In fact, a nuclear test ban treaty 核试验禁止条约 where no atmospheric testing is proposed by Kennedy.

Keep in mind during the Cold War the arms race 军备竞赛 is going to continue even though Eisenhower warned of the military-industrial complex 军工复合体. Kennedy is going to continue the arms race, but there's going to be some differences. The Kennedy administration moved away from the Dulles idea of massive retaliation 大规模报复 and the "New Look" policy which relied on nuclear weapons. In fact, the problem was nuclear weapons could not be used in smaller conflicts in countries such as Vietnam or Laos. If there's these small little brush fires 小规模冲突, you really can't use a nuclear bomb.

So Kennedy and his defense secretary -- Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (very important guy, you can see right there) -- they proposed an idea called flexible response 灵活反应战略. This basically said we would increase our spending on conventional weapons 常规武器 and maintain a variety of options. So if there's a situation where the Soviets are providing weapons or money or training, we would be able to go in and help out our side with these variety of options.

Kennedy does call for the creation of the Green Berets 绿色贝雷帽 -- a highly trained special forces unit 特种部队, and defense spending continues to rise under Kennedy. This is a part of the Cold War.

Kennedy's administration is going to be cut short 中断 unfortunately when he is assassinated 被暗杀 in Dallas in November of 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald. There's the gun that was used. Following Kennedy's assassination, his vice president from Texas -- Lyndon Baines Johnson -- becomes the president. There he is taking the oath of office 宣誓就职 aboard Air Force One.

And Johnson's an interesting character -- he's a New Deal Democrat 新政民主党人, he's been around for 30 years as a member of Congress, and he really wants to expand the reforms of the New Deal and use the power of the federal government to create change. In fact, Lyndon Johnson's domestic program was called the Great Society 伟大社会, and it would dramatically increase the size and the scope 范围 of the federal government. But unlike the New Deal, the Great Society will seek to advance the cause of civil rights -- very important thing to know.

Some of the key areas of reform for Lyndon Johnson are going to be in the area of immigration reform 移民改革, civil rights, education funding, and medical help for the elderly. So we'll take a look at how those goals were achieved under Johnson's administration.

Really important you know about the Great Society. One of the key aspects of it was the war on poverty 向贫困宣战. In fact, Michael Harrington's book called "The Other America" turned the nation's attention on the 40 million people living in poverty in America. In fact, Johnson -- one of the first things he does is he declares an unconditional war on poverty 无条件向贫困宣战. Congress created the Office of Economic Opportunity 经济机会办公室 which was an anti-poverty agency, and a variety of programs are going to be established.

One of those is the Head Start program 启蒙计划 which would provide free preschool for low-income individuals. Job Corps 职业训练团 which would give vocational education 职业教育 to those people to lift them up out of poverty. Literacy and legal programs are created. And the biggie -- really not connected to poverty though -- is the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 移民与国籍法案. There's Johnson signing it over there by the Statue of Liberty. This ends the quotas of the 1920s -- remember the quota of 1921, the quota of 1924 -- it ended the quotas designed to restrict certain nationalities. And following the Immigration Act of 1965, you get a huge increase of immigrants from Latin America, Asia, and other countries.

Johnson runs for reelection in 1964 and he runs with a clear liberal agenda 自由派议程. He wants to increase the welfare state 福利国家, increase the size of the federal government. It's important to know that Republicans though do not like this -- they didn't like it under the New Deal and they don't like it under Johnson. And they turn to the conservative Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona. He wants to end the welfare state -- he wants to balance the budget. He does not like programs like Social Security or the TVA or any of these other Great Society programs that are being proposed.

And Johnson wins in a landslide victory 压倒性胜利, but it's important to keep in mind new conservative leaders are emerging in this period of the 1960s. They don't like the programs of the New Deal or Great Society, and you're going to have a conservative reaction coming. 1968 Nixon's going to get elected, and during the election of '64 people like Ronald Reagan start coming up and making a name for themselves.

However, for Johnson, he has something that Truman did not have -- he has the presidency and the Democrats control Congress. So now he has the power to create change, and Johnson's going to do that with a variety of Great Society programs. So here are just a few highlights -- you can't cover them all:

Medicare 医疗保险 is around today -- gives health care for those people over the age of 65. Medicaid 医疗补助 -- health care for the poor and the disabled. Food stamp programs 食品券计划. Federal money for the arts. Public housing 公共住房. Regulation of the auto industry. And a whole bunch of other federal programs are created during President Johnson's administration.

Rachel Carson's book "Silent Spring" really shocked the nation when it exposed the use of pesticides 杀虫剂 and how DDT was destroying wildlife in 1962, and it helps stimulate interest and leads to the creation of the Clear Air and Water Acts 清洁空气和水法案 under the Great Society.

And once again, the Great Society expands the welfare state to provide assistance to those previously ignored -- the poor, the disabled, the elderly, and civil rights. It kind of continues what the New Deal was trying to do in a much bigger and broader way. However, there are lots of critics to the Great Society, and it's important you know those. Many people -- especially Republicans and conservatives -- felt these programs were too costly, inefficient, too idealistic -- you can't really fix some of these problems -- and they created a dependency 依赖性. So you're going to see a reaction to the Great Society from those individuals.

Another important thing to keep in mind is the civil rights movement 民权运动. Under Kennedy, though progress was slow on the issue of civil rights -- he did not win with a large victory in 1960 -- so Kennedy, just like Roosevelt, was hesitant to really push the issue on a national stage. However, grassroots movements 草根运动 keep the pressure up for change.

We saw the sit-ins 静坐抗议 in Greensboro, North Carolina. There's the freedom rides 自由乘车运动 where the Congress of Racial Equality -- members of CORE -- try to end segregation 种族隔离 in bus facilities by traveling through the South to bring attention to the issue. These individuals were often times met by violence. You could see one of the freedom ride buses being firebombed 被燃烧弹袭击 by racist individuals.

In spite of this, the movement continued. You have JFK eventually sending troops to allow James Meredith to register at the University of Mississippi. Keep in mind James Meredith is an Air Force veteran 空军退伍军人. The federal court said he could attend the university, and protesters try to keep him out. Kennedy sends in the troops to allow James Meredith to attend Ole Miss.

You have Martin Luther King and other civil rights activists were thrown in jail during protests in Birmingham, Alabama. Alabama was an area of extreme segregation and lack of black voting taking place. And so people like King and other ordinary individuals are using nonviolent protest 非暴力抗议 -- as you could see in the image -- to bring attention to this issue. King writes the very famous "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" 来自伯明翰监狱的信 in which he talks about nonviolence and the need for civil disobedience 公民不服从.

In 1963 you get an extremely important moment where you have the March on Washington 华盛顿大游行 of over 200,000 white, black, and other civil rights activists. And it is at this place where King gives his "I Have a Dream" speech 我有一个梦想演讲.

Following the assassination of Kennedy, you have really kind of momentum picking up for the civil rights movement. President Johnson along with Congress signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 民权法案. There's Johnson shaking hands with King. And really what it does is segregation is illegal in all public facilities, and it establishes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 平等就业机会委员会. This bans discrimination in employment -- everything from race, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination. And the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows the federal government the power to enforce desegregation 废除种族隔离 in all different areas of life.

However, the civil rights movement still had a really key area to focus on, and that is the right to vote. There was a lack of voting rights, and it remained a major problem in many Southern states. The 24th Amendment 第二十四修正案 was passed and ratified which outlawed the collection of poll taxes 人头税 -- which was a common device used to disenfranchise 剥夺选举权 African-American voters.

During the Freedom Summer of 1964 自由之夏, there's a huge voter registration drive 选民登记运动 in Mississippi. In Mississippi, only 5% of eligible blacks were registered to vote. And during the Freedom Summer, you have civil rights activists suddenly going missing.

In 1965 you have the very famous march from Selma to Montgomery 塞尔玛到蒙哥马利游行, and they're trying to bring attention to the issue of voting rights. And local law enforcement stops this peaceful nonviolent protest with violence. You can see in those images right there. LBJ does send in federal troops to protect the nonviolent civil rights protesters.

And the big moment comes with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 投票权法案 which ended efforts to prevent African-Americans from voting in the South. For example, literacy tests 识字测试 are banned. With the Voting Rights Act, you see black people voting in the Deep South in large numbers for the first time since Reconstruction. This is a huge transformation of Southern politics.

In spite of this though, there was a growing frustration with the slow pace of change. In fact, not too long after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, you have radicalization 激进化 of the civil rights movement. In fact, in 1965 the Watts riots 瓦茨暴动 break out in Los Angeles following an arrest of a black motorist by white police officers. The riots last for 6 days -- 34 people are killed, hundreds of buildings are destroyed, and riots are going to spread to other cities in the years to follow.

Many African-Americans began to question the use of nonviolence. In fact, there starts to be calls to use black violence to counter white violence. Most famously, Malcolm X joins the Nation of Islam 伊斯兰民族组织 and he emphasized black nationalism 黑人民族主义, self-improvement, and separatism 分离主义. So you have the radicalization of some segments of the civil rights movement. Malcolm X unfortunately will be assassinated in 1965 by members of the Nation of Islam.

But other groups are going to pop up. You have the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -- Stokely Carmichael -- who's really going to call for black power 黑人权力 -- economic power for African-Americans, racial separatism. And you have in Oakland, California a group of people called the Black Panthers 黑豹党 founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. Once again, this radicalization of the movement is very often times calling for self-rule 自治 for African-Americans. They were much more militant 好战的, and as a result they say non-violent protests are not the best path to full equality.

It's important to keep in mind that all of these events are taking place at the same time the US involvement in Vietnam is increasing. In 1954 while President Eisenhower was still in office, the French lose the Battle of Dien Bien Phu 奠边府战役 and abandon Vietnam. The US was giving lots of money to France in their effort to recolonize Vietnam. Following the French removal, the US involvement increases under President Eisenhower. We continue to give support to the unpopular leader -- because he was non-communist -- of South Vietnam named Diem. There's Eisenhower and Diem shaking some hands.

When Kennedy takes office in 1961, he continues to increase and escalate 升级 US involvement. Military advisers are sent into the South to protect the Diem regime. The regime continues to become unpopular. Diem is assassinated. And when Johnson takes power, you have an event -- a really important event -- in 1964 called the Gulf of Tonkin incident 东京湾事件. LBJ claims the US ship was attacked by North Vietnamese in the Gulf of Tonkin. There are huge questions as to whether or not that attack even took place.

And the Gulf of Tonkin incident leads to Congress issuing a blank check 空白支票 for LBJ to send ground troops 地面部队 into Vietnam. And we begin the bulk of the fighting in South Vietnam against the communist forces. For 3 years, the US public was told that the war was going well -- that the war was almost over. And in 1968 during the Tet Offensive 春节攻势 -- a surprise attack by North Vietnam into the South during the Vietnamese New Year -- shocks the American public because it reveals the war is nowhere near being over and the government was in fact misleading the American people.

Anti-war protests 反战抗议 intensify even more so after 1968. There was already questions about the war before, but Tet just increases those questions. And really important point to keep in mind when studying the '60s is there's a variety of movements emerging during this period. The Vietnam War deeply divided the nation between hawks 鹰派 who were pro-war and doves 鸽派 who are anti-war. The war also distracted and took away funds from the Great Society and really ruins the presidency of Lyndon Johnson.

And you have huge anti-war protests taking place especially on college campuses. In fact, on college campuses such as UC Berkeley, you have the Free Speech Movement 言论自由运动 developing. You have groups like the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) 民主社会学生组织 -- they issued the Port Huron Statement 休伦港宣言 -- and other New Left movements 新左派运动 spread across college campuses as many people began joining the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, and a variety of movements taking place.

Betty Friedan -- remember -- wrote the book "The Feminine Mystique," and later on she would help co-found the National Organization for Women (NOW) 全国妇女组织. Her group and others would campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment 平等权利修正案. It eventually gets defeated in the early '70s, but you have the rise of the feminist and women's rights movement in American society.

And in 1969 you have the Stonewall riots 石墙骚动 when police harassing gay patrons of a place called Stonewall resist. And the Stonewall riots gave rise to the modern gay rights movement 同性恋权利运动 in American society. You're also going to have other movements amongst Latinos, American Indians, and Asian-Americans as they also began to demand social and economic equality.

All right everyone, that's a real quick overview of a very complex time in American history. Make sure you do your reading, check out my other videos. If the video helped you, click like. Peace.

各位网络朋友，大家好！今天我们来探讨20世纪60年代发生的事件，涵盖肯尼迪和约翰逊执政期间发生的事情。如果你正在备考APUSH，这些是一些相关的书籍以及本视频与之的关联。

我们首先从肯尼迪开始。记住1960年的总统选举——肯尼迪与副总统理查德·尼克松竞选。这是一次重要的选举，因为这是候选人首次在一系列辩论中在电视上正面交锋。大多数人认为肯尼迪赢得了电视辩论——他看起来很好，带着一股自信，而尼克松则脸色苍白，胡子拉碴。这标志着美国政治的转型以及电视在其中的作用的开始。

肯尼迪是第一位当选的罗马天主教总统。记住，1928年我们看到艾尔·史密斯参选，而宗教问题确实在选举中发挥了关键作用。肯尼迪打破了这一障碍，成为第一位天主教总统。肯尼迪总统推行了一项名为“新边疆”的国内计划，他实际上希望联邦政府为教育、医疗保健计划、民权等提供资金。但他并没有取得决定性的胜利——他仅以略多于10万张选票的优势击败了尼克松。因此，他在国内能够取得的成就将受到限制。

事实上，他的大部分国内议程都将被国会阻挠，并被对外交事务的担忧所掩盖。他将公开呼吁国家率先将人类送上月球。他发表了一次充满激情的演讲，你们知道在肯尼迪执政期间，太空竞赛将继续进行。数十亿美元将被投入，这将有助于经济发展，1969年美国将成为第一个将人类送上月球的国家。

肯尼迪还创建了和平队，旨在派遣美国人到发展中国家提供帮助。冷战在肯尼迪执政期间继续存在——这将是肯尼迪执政时期生活的一个现实。他执政期间的苏联新领导人是尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫，这两个人将在世界各地争夺影响力。

1961年，肯尼迪确实主持建立了争取进步联盟。这是拉丁美洲的一项经济发展计划。你们知道有些人称其为拉丁美洲的马歇尔计划。但其成果有限。一个重要的重大事件是拉丁美洲的猪湾入侵。肯尼迪批准了他中央情报局的计划，该计划实际上是在艾森豪威尔总统执政期间制定的，根据该计划，美国——中央情报局——将训练古巴流亡者推翻卡斯特罗政府。他们将在猪湾登陆，希望古巴人民会奋起推翻卡斯特罗。

这次入侵彻底失败，古巴流亡者于1961年在猪湾登陆，但没有民众起义来支持他们。事实上，卡斯特罗轻易地镇压了叛乱。这对肯尼迪来说是一个巨大的尴尬——完全砸了他的脸。由于美国没有提供支持，这次入侵注定失败。由于猪湾入侵，卡斯特罗和赫鲁晓夫——古巴人和苏联人——走得更近了。

在一个完全不相关的事件中，苏联于1961年在东德开始修建柏林墙。柏林墙的真正目的是阻止东德人逃往西德。你们可以看到肯尼迪访问了柏林墙的西柏林一侧，并承诺美国支持西柏林。

肯尼迪总统任期内的一个重要时刻是1962年的古巴导弹危机。10月，美国U-2侦察机发现苏联正在古巴内部安装进攻性核武器。这些武器能够袭击大多数美国城市，并在几分钟内杀死数百万美国人。你们可以在地图上看到其中一些城市和所需时间。肯尼迪下令对古巴进行海军封锁——他称之为隔离，因为封锁在技术上是一种战争行为——他试图迫使苏联撤走导弹。

这是一个非常紧张的局势，也是双方有史以来最接近潜在核战争的一次。肯尼迪和赫鲁晓夫处于紧张的对峙之中。在这种情况下存在各种各样的“如果”——如果苏联突破封锁会怎么样？美国会开火并交战吗？肯尼迪的顾问们绝大多数都建议他在导弹投入使用之前发动袭击。我们现在知道那些导弹已经投入使用，如果肯尼迪发动袭击，后果可能不堪设想。

经过紧张的对峙，赫鲁晓夫最终同意撤走导弹，双方达成了一些协议。肯尼迪承诺美国不会试图入侵古巴，而美国将在稍后——6个月后——从土耳其撤走针对苏联的美国导弹。

古巴导弹危机的影响：双方在华盛顿和莫斯科之间设立了一条热线，以便我们能够立即沟通，以防止未来危机的发生，并且增加了缓和紧张局势——缓和政策——的呼声。事实上，肯尼迪提议了一项禁止大气层核试验的核试验条约。

记住，尽管艾森豪威尔警告过军事工业复合体的危险，但在冷战期间，军备竞赛将继续进行。肯尼迪将继续军备竞赛，但会有一些不同之处。肯尼迪政府放弃了杜勒斯的大规模报复和依赖核武器的“新面貌”政策。事实上，问题在于核武器不能用于越南或老挝等国的小规模冲突。如果出现这些小小的冲突，你们真的不能使用核弹。

因此，肯尼迪及其国防部长——国防部长罗伯特·麦克纳马拉（非常重要的人物，你们可以在那里看到他）——提出了一个名为“灵活反应”的想法。这基本上意味着我们将增加在常规武器上的开支并保持多种选择。因此，如果出现苏联提供武器、资金或训练的情况，我们将能够利用这些多种选择来帮助我们的一方。

肯尼迪确实呼吁创建绿色贝雷帽——一支训练有素的特种部队——并且在肯尼迪执政期间，国防开支继续增加。这是冷战的一部分。

不幸的是，肯尼迪的总统任期将被缩短，他于1963年11月在达拉斯被李·哈维·奥斯瓦尔德暗杀。那是使用的枪支。肯尼迪遇刺后，来自德克萨斯州的副总统林登·贝恩斯·约翰逊成为总统。他在空军一号上宣誓就职。

约翰逊是一个有趣的人物——他是一位新政时期的民主党人，作为国会议员已经有30年了，他真正想扩大新政的改革，并利用联邦政府的力量来创造变革。事实上，林登·约翰逊的国内计划被称为“伟大社会”，它将极大地扩大联邦政府的规模和范围。但与新政不同的是，“伟大社会”将寻求推进民权事业——这是一个非常重要的知识点。

林登·约翰逊改革的一些关键领域将是移民改革、民权、教育经费和老年人医疗援助。因此，我们将研究在约翰逊政府领导下如何实现这些目标。

真正重要的是你们要了解“伟大社会”。其关键方面之一是消除贫困的战争。事实上，迈克尔·哈林顿的书《另一个美国》使全国人民关注美国4000万生活在贫困中的人口。事实上，约翰逊——他首先采取的行动之一就是宣布对贫困进行无条件战争。国会成立了经济机会办公室，这是一个反贫困机构，并将建立各种计划。

其中一项是“起步计划”，该计划将为低收入人群提供免费学前教育。“就业队”将为这些人提供职业教育，以帮助他们摆脱贫困。识字和法律援助计划也得以建立。最重要的——尽管与贫困没有直接联系——是1965年的《移民和国籍法》。约翰逊在那里自由女神像旁签署了这项法案。这结束了20世纪20年代的配额——记住1921年的配额，1924年的配额——它结束了旨在限制某些国籍的配额。在1965年《移民法》通过后，来自拉丁美洲、亚洲和其他国家的移民人数大幅增加。

约翰逊在1964年竞选连任，他带着明确的自由主义纲领竞选。他想扩大福利国家，扩大联邦政府的规模。重要的是要知道，共和党人不喜欢这一点——他们在罗斯福新政时期不喜欢，在约翰逊时期也不喜欢。他们转向来自亚利桑那州的保守派参议员巴里·戈德华特。他想结束福利国家——他想平衡预算。他不喜欢社会保障、田纳西河谷管理局或任何其他正在提出的伟大社会计划。

约翰逊以压倒性优势获胜，但重要的是要记住，在20世纪60年代这个时期，新的保守派领导人正在崛起。他们不喜欢新政或伟大社会的计划，你们将看到保守派的反弹即将到来。1968年尼克松将当选总统，而在1964年的选举中，像罗纳德·里根这样的人开始崭露头角。

然而，对于约翰逊来说，他拥有杜鲁门所没有的东西——他拥有总统职位，而民主党控制着国会。因此，他现在有能力创造变革，约翰逊将通过各种伟大社会计划来实现这一点。这里只是一些亮点——无法涵盖所有内容：

医疗保险今天仍然存在——为65岁以上的人提供医疗保健。医疗补助——为穷人和残疾人提供医疗保健。食品券计划。联邦艺术资金。公共住房。汽车工业监管。在约翰逊总统执政期间，还创建了许多其他联邦计划。

蕾切尔·卡森的《寂静的春天》在1962年揭露了农药的使用以及滴滴涕如何破坏野生动物，震惊了全国，并有助于激发人们的兴趣，最终在伟大社会框架下促成了《清洁空气法》和《清洁水法》的颁布。

再一次，“伟大社会”扩大了福利国家的范围，为以前被忽视的人群——穷人、残疾人、老年人和少数族裔——提供援助。它以更大、更广泛的方式延续了新政试图做的事情。然而，对“伟大社会”有很多批评，重要的是你们要了解这些批评。许多人——特别是共和党人和保守派——认为这些计划成本过高、效率低下、过于理想化——你们不可能真正解决其中的一些问题——并且它们造成了依赖性。因此，你们将看到这些人对“伟大社会”的反弹。

另一个需要记住的重要问题是民权运动。在肯尼迪执政期间，尽管在民权问题上的进展缓慢——他在1960年并没有以压倒性优势获胜——因此，肯尼迪像罗斯福一样，不愿真正在全国范围内推动这个问题。然而，基层运动不断施加压力要求变革。

我们看到了北卡罗来纳州格林斯伯勒的静坐示威。还有“自由乘车”运动，种族平等 Congress（CORE）的成员试图通过在南方旅行以引起人们对该问题的关注来结束公共汽车设施的种族隔离。这些人常常遭到暴力对待。你们可以看到一辆自由乘车巴士被种族主义者投掷燃烧弹。

尽管如此，运动仍在继续。你们看到肯尼迪最终派遣军队允许詹姆斯·梅雷迪斯在密西西比大学注册。记住，詹姆斯·梅雷迪斯是一位空军退伍军人。联邦法院裁定他可以就读该大学，但抗议者试图阻止他入学。肯尼迪派遣军队允许詹姆斯·梅雷迪斯进入密西西比大学。

你们看到马丁·路德·金和其他民权活动家在阿拉巴马州伯明翰的抗议活动中被捕。阿拉巴马州是一个种族隔离极端严重且黑人缺乏投票权的地方。因此，像金和其他普通人一样，他们使用非暴力抗议——正如你们在图片中看到的那样——来引起人们对这个问题的关注。金写了非常著名的《伯明翰监狱来信》，他在信中谈到了非暴力和公民不服从的必要性。

1963年，你们迎来了一个极其重要的时刻，超过20万白人、黑人和其他民权活动家在华盛顿举行了游行。正是在这里，金发表了他著名的“我有一个梦想”的演讲。

肯尼迪遇刺后，民权运动的势头真正开始增强。约翰逊总统与国会签署了1964年《民权法案》。约翰逊在那里与金握手。该法案实际上规定，所有公共设施的种族隔离都是非法的，并设立了公平就业机会委员会。这禁止了就业歧视——包括种族、宗教、性别和民族出身歧视。《1964年民权法案》赋予联邦政府权力在生活的各个领域强制执行取消种族隔离。

然而，民权运动仍然有一个非常关键的领域需要关注，那就是投票权。缺乏投票权仍然是许多南方各州的一个主要问题。第24修正案获得通过并批准，该修正案取缔了人头税的征收——这是剥夺非裔美国选民权利的一种常用手段。

在1964年“自由之夏”期间，密西西比州开展了一场大规模的选民登记运动。在密西西比州，只有5%的符合条件的黑人登记投票。在“自由之夏”期间，你们看到民权活动家突然失踪。

1965年，你们看到了从塞尔玛到蒙哥马利的非常著名的游行，他们试图引起人们对投票权问题的关注。当地执法部门以暴力手段阻止了这次和平的非暴力抗议。你们可以在那些图片中看到。约翰逊总统确实派遣了联邦军队来保护非暴力的民权抗议者。

最重要的时刻是1965年《投票权法案》的通过，该法案结束了阻止南方非裔美国人投票的努力。例如，识字测试被禁止。随着《投票权法案》的实施，你们看到自重建以来，黑人在深南地区首次大规模投票。这是南方政治的巨大转变。

尽管如此，人们对变革的缓慢步伐越来越感到沮丧。事实上，在1965年《投票权法案》通过后不久，民权运动就出现了激进化。事实上，1965年，在白人警察逮捕一名黑人司机后，洛杉矶爆发了瓦茨骚乱。骚乱持续了6天——34人死亡，数百栋建筑物被毁，骚乱将在随后的几年蔓延到其他城市。

许多非裔美国人开始质疑非暴力手段的使用。事实上，开始出现呼吁使用黑人暴力来对抗白人暴力。最著名的是，马尔科姆·X加入了伊斯兰民族，他强调黑人民族主义、自我提升和分离主义。因此，你们看到民权运动的一些部分激进化了。不幸的是，马尔科姆·X于1965年被伊斯兰民族的成员暗杀。

但其他团体将涌现出来。你们有学生非暴力协调委员会的领导人——斯托克利·卡迈克尔——他真正呼吁黑人权力——非裔美国人的经济权力、种族分离主义。在加利福尼亚州奥克兰，你们看到由休伊·牛顿和鲍比·西尔创立的黑豹党。再一次，这场运动的激进化常常呼吁非裔美国人的自治。他们更加激进，因此他们说非暴力抗议不是实现完全平等的最佳途径。

重要的是要记住，所有这些事件都发生在美国在越南的介入日益加剧的同时。1954年，当艾森豪威尔总统仍在任时，法国在奠边府战役中失利并放弃了越南。美国向法国提供了大量资金，以帮助他们重新殖民越南。法国撤出后，在美国总统艾森豪威尔领导下，美国的介入增加。我们继续支持南越不受欢迎的领导人——因为他不是共产主义者——吴庭艳。这是艾森豪威尔和吴庭艳握手的照片。

1961年肯尼迪上任后，他继续增加和升级美国的介入。军事顾问被派往南方以保护吴庭艳政权。该政权继续变得不受欢迎。吴庭艳被暗杀。约翰逊上台后，1964年发生了一件大事——东京湾事件。约翰逊声称美国军舰在东京湾遭到北越袭击。关于这次袭击是否真的发生存在巨大的疑问。

东京湾事件导致国会向约翰逊开了一张空白支票，允许他向越南派遣地面部队。我们开始在南越对共产主义军队进行大规模战斗。三年间，美国公众被告知战争进展顺利——战争即将结束。但在1968年春节攻势期间——北越在越南新年期间对南方发动的一次突然袭击——震惊了美国公众，因为它表明战争远未结束，而政府实际上在误导美国人民。

1968年后，反战抗议活动更加激烈。在此之前就有人对战争提出质疑，但春节攻势只会加剧这些质疑。在研究20世纪60年代时，真正需要记住的一点是，在此期间出现了各种各样的运动。越南战争在支持战争的鹰派和反对战争的鸽派之间深深地分裂了这个国家。战争也分散了“伟大社会”的资金并夺走了资金，并真正毁掉了林登·约翰逊的总统任期。

你们看到大规模的反战抗议活动发生，尤其是在大学校园里。事实上，在加州大学伯克利分校等大学校园里，自由言论运动正在发展。你们看到像民主社会学生会（SDS）这样的团体——他们发布了《休伦港声明》——以及其他新左派运动在大学校园蔓延，因为许多人开始加入民权运动、反战运动和各种正在发生的运动。

记住，贝蒂·弗里丹写了《女性的奥秘》，后来她帮助共同创立了全国妇女组织（NOW）。她的团体和其他团体将为平等权利修正案奔走呼号。该修正案最终在20世纪70年代初被否决，但你们看到了美国社会女权主义和妇女权利运动的兴起。

1969年，在警察骚扰一家名为石墙酒吧的同性恋顾客时，发生了石墙骚乱。石墙骚乱促成了美国社会现代同性恋权利运动的兴起。你们还将看到拉丁裔、美洲印第安人和亚裔美国人之间的其他运动，他们也开始要求社会和经济平等。

Greetings, internet people. Today we're taking a look at the events of the 1960s, covering what went down during JFK and LBJ's administration. If you're studying for APUSH, those are some of the books and how this video lines up to them.

So we're going to start off with JFK. And remember the election of 1960 -- JFK's running against the vice president Richard Nixon. And this is an important election because it's the first time candidates face off on television in a series of debates. And most people say Kennedy wins the television debate -- he looks good, he has a swagger to him, whereas Nixon is pale and pasty and has the 5:00 shadow. So this begins the transformation of American politics and TV's role in it.

Kennedy is the first Catholic president elected. Remember in 1928 we saw Al Smith running and that issue really kind of played a key role in the election. Kennedy breaks through that barrier and becomes the first Catholic president. President Kennedy runs on a domestic program known as the New Frontier, and really he wants federal money to education, health care programs, civil rights, etc. But he doesn't really have a decisive win -- he only wins by a little more than 100,000 votes over Nixon. So he's going to be limited in what he's going to be able to accomplish domestically.

In fact, most of his domestic agenda will be blocked by Congress and overshadowed by concerns over foreign affairs. He is going to openly call on the nation to be the first to put a man on the moon. He gives a really passionate speech, and you know during Kennedy's administration the space race is going to continue. Billions of dollars will be spent, this will help the economy, and in 1969 the United States will be the first country to put a man on the moon.

Kennedy also creates the Peace Corps, which is created to send Americans to underdeveloped countries to help out. Now the Cold War continues under Kennedy -- it's going to be a reality of life under JFK. The new Soviet leader during his administration is Nikita Khrushchev, and those two men are going to be competing for influence around the world.

Kennedy does oversee in 1961 the creation of the Alliance for Progress. It's an economic development program for Latin America. You know some people call it the Marshall Plan for Latin America. It has limited results. Big important event is the Bay of Pigs invasion in Latin America. JFK approves of his CIA plan that was actually planned under President Eisenhower's administration in which the US -- the CIA -- would train Cuban exiles to overthrow the Castro government. They would land at the Bay of Pigs, and the hope would be that the Cuban people would rise up and remove Castro.

The invasion is a complete failure as the Cuban exiles land in the Bay of Pigs in 1961 and no uprising comes to their support. In fact, Castro easily crushes the rebellion. It's a huge embarrassment for JFK -- it blows up in his face. And since the US does not send support, the invasion was doomed to failure. And as a result of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Castro and Khrushchev -- the Cubans and the Soviets -- move closer together.

In a completely unrelated event, the Soviet Union begins construction of the Berlin Wall in East Germany in 1961. And really the goal of the Berlin Wall is to keep East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. And you could see Kennedy visiting the West Berlin side of that wall and pledging US support for West Berlin.

A big moment of Kennedy's presidency is the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. In October, US U-2 spy planes discover that the Soviets were installing offensive nuclear weapons inside of Cuba. These weapons were capable of hitting most American cities and could kill millions of Americans in minutes. And you can see on the map some of those cities and times. Kennedy orders a naval blockade of Cuba -- he calls it a quarantine because a blockade is technically an act of war -- and he's trying to pressure the Soviets to remove the missiles.

This is a very tense situation and it's the closest that the two sides ever came to a potential nuclear war. Kennedy and Khrushchev are in a tense standoff. There's all sorts of "what ifs" in this situation -- what if the Soviets run the blockade? Would the US shoot and engage in battle? The advisers of JFK overwhelmingly were telling him to attack before the missiles become operational. We now know that those missiles were already operational, and if Kennedy would have attacked it could have been really really bad.

Khrushchev eventually after a tense standoff agrees to remove the missiles, and a couple of things are reached in a deal. Kennedy promises that we will not try to invade Cuba, and the US would later on -- 6 months later -- remove US missiles from Turkey that were pointed at the Soviet Union.

The impact of the Cuban Missile Crisis: they installed a hotline between DC and Moscow so that we can communicate instantly to try to prevent a future crisis, and it increases calls for relaxing of tensions -- détente. In fact, a nuclear test ban treaty where no atmospheric testing is proposed by Kennedy.

Keep in mind during the Cold War the arms race is going to continue even though Eisenhower warned of the military-industrial complex. Kennedy is going to continue the arms race, but there's going to be some differences. The Kennedy administration moved away from the Dulles idea of massive retaliation and the "New Look" policy which relied on nuclear weapons. In fact, the problem was nuclear weapons could not be used in smaller conflicts in countries such as Vietnam or Laos. If there's these small little brush fires, you really can't use a nuclear bomb.

So Kennedy and his defense secretary -- Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (very important guy, you can see right there) -- they proposed an idea called flexible response. This basically said we would increase our spending on conventional weapons and maintain a variety of options. So if there's a situation where the Soviets are providing weapons or money or training, we would be able to go in and help out our side with these variety of options.

Kennedy does call for the creation of the Green Berets -- a highly trained special forces unit -- and defense spending continues to rise under Kennedy. This is a part of the Cold War.

Kennedy's administration is going to be cut short unfortunately when he is assassinated in Dallas in November of 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald. There's the gun that was used. Following Kennedy's assassination, his vice president from Texas -- Lyndon Baines Johnson -- becomes the president. There he is taking the oath of office aboard Air Force One.

And Johnson's an interesting character -- he's a New Deal Democrat, he's been around for 30 years as a member of Congress, and he really wants to expand the reforms of the New Deal and use the power of the federal government to create change. In fact, Lyndon Johnson's domestic program was called the Great Society, and it would dramatically increase the size and the scope of the federal government. But unlike the New Deal, the Great Society will seek to advance the cause of civil rights -- very important thing to know.

Some of the key areas of reform for Lyndon Johnson are going to be in the area of immigration reform, civil rights, education funding, and medical help for the elderly. So we'll take a look at how those goals were achieved under Johnson's administration.

Really important you know about the Great Society. One of the key aspects of it was the war on poverty. In fact, Michael Harrington's book called "The Other America" turned the nation's attention on the 40 million people living in poverty in America. In fact, Johnson -- one of the first things he does is he declares an unconditional war on poverty. Congress created the Office of Economic Opportunity which was an anti-poverty agency, and a variety of programs are going to be established.

One of those is the Head Start program which would provide free preschool for low-income individuals. Job Corps which would give vocational education to those people to lift them up out of poverty. Literacy and legal programs are created. And the biggie -- really not connected to poverty though -- is the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. There's Johnson signing it over there by the Statue of Liberty. This ends the quotas of the 1920s -- remember the quota of 1921, the quota of 1924 -- it ended the quotas designed to restrict certain nationalities. And following the Immigration Act of 1965, you get a huge increase of immigrants from Latin America, Asia, and other countries.

Johnson runs for reelection in 1964 and he runs with a clear liberal agenda. He wants to increase the welfare state, increase the size of the federal government. It's important to know that Republicans though do not like this -- they didn't like it under the New Deal and they don't like it under Johnson. And they turn to the conservative Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona. He wants to end the welfare state -- he wants to balance the budget. He does not like programs like Social Security or the TVA or any of these other Great Society programs that are being proposed.

And Johnson wins in a landslide victory, but it's important to keep in mind new conservative leaders are emerging in this period of the 1960s. They don't like the programs of the New Deal or Great Society, and you're going to have a conservative reaction coming. 1968 Nixon's going to get elected, and during the election of '64 people like Ronald Reagan start coming up and making a name for themselves.

However, for Johnson, he has something that Truman did not have -- he has the presidency and the Democrats control Congress. So now he has the power to create change, and Johnson's going to do that with a variety of Great Society programs. So here are just a few highlights -- you can't cover them all:

Medicare is around today -- gives health care for those people over the age of 65. Medicaid -- health care for the poor and the disabled. Food stamp programs. Federal money for the arts. Public housing. Regulation of the auto industry. And a whole bunch of other federal programs are created during President Johnson's administration.

Rachel Carson's book "Silent Spring" really shocked the nation when it exposed the use of pesticides and how DDT was destroying wildlife in 1962, and it helps stimulate interest and leads to the creation of the Clear Air and Water Acts under the Great Society.

And once again, the Great Society expands the welfare state to provide assistance to those previously ignored -- the poor, the disabled, the elderly, and civil rights. It kind of continues what the New Deal was trying to do in a much bigger and broader way. However, there are lots of critics to the Great Society, and it's important you know those. Many people -- especially Republicans and conservatives -- felt these programs were too costly, inefficient, too idealistic -- you can't really fix some of these problems -- and they created a dependency. So you're going to see a reaction to the Great Society from those individuals.

Another important thing to keep in mind is the civil rights movement. Under Kennedy, though progress was slow on the issue of civil rights -- he did not win with a large victory in 1960 -- so Kennedy, just like Roosevelt, was hesitant to really push the issue on a national stage. However, grassroots movements keep the pressure up for change.

We saw the sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina. There's the freedom rides where the Congress of Racial Equality -- members of CORE -- try to end segregation in bus facilities by traveling through the South to bring attention to the issue. These individuals were often times met by violence. You could see one of the freedom ride buses being firebombed by racist individuals.

In spite of this, the movement continued. You have JFK eventually sending troops to allow James Meredith to register at the University of Mississippi. Keep in mind James Meredith is an Air Force veteran. The federal court said he could attend the university, and protesters try to keep him out. Kennedy sends in the troops to allow James Meredith to attend Ole Miss.

You have Martin Luther King and other civil rights activists were thrown in jail during protests in Birmingham, Alabama. Alabama was an area of extreme segregation and lack of black voting taking place. And so people like King and other ordinary individuals are using nonviolent protest -- as you could see in the image -- to bring attention to this issue. King writes the very famous "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" in which he talks about nonviolence and the need for civil disobedience.

In 1963 you get an extremely important moment where you have the March on Washington of over 200,000 white, black, and other civil rights activists. And it is at this place where King gives his "I Have a Dream" speech.

Following the assassination of Kennedy, you have really kind of momentum picking up for the civil rights movement. President Johnson along with Congress signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There's Johnson shaking hands with King. And really what it does is segregation is illegal in all public facilities, and it establishes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This bans discrimination in employment -- everything from race, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination. And the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows the federal government the power to enforce desegregation in all different areas of life.

However, the civil rights movement still had a really key area to focus on, and that is the right to vote. There was a lack of voting rights, and it remained a major problem in many Southern states. The 24th Amendment was passed and ratified which outlawed the collection of poll taxes -- which was a common device used to disenfranchise African-American voters.

During the Freedom Summer of 1964, there's a huge voter registration drive in Mississippi. In Mississippi, only 5% of eligible blacks were registered to vote. And during the Freedom Summer, you have civil rights activists suddenly going missing.

In 1965 you have the very famous march from Selma to Montgomery, and they're trying to bring attention to the issue of voting rights. And local law enforcement stops this peaceful nonviolent protest with violence. You can see in those images right there. LBJ does send in federal troops to protect the nonviolent civil rights protesters.

And the big moment comes with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which ended efforts to prevent African-Americans from voting in the South. For example, literacy tests are banned. With the Voting Rights Act, you see black people voting in the Deep South in large numbers for the first time since Reconstruction. This is a huge transformation of Southern politics.

In spite of this though, there was a growing frustration with the slow pace of change. In fact, not too long after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, you have radicalization of the civil rights movement. In fact, in 1965 the Watts riots break out in Los Angeles following an arrest of a black motorist by white police officers. The riots last for 6 days -- 34 people are killed, hundreds of buildings are destroyed, and riots are going to spread to other cities in the years to follow.

Many African-Americans began to question the use of nonviolence. In fact, there starts to be calls to use black violence to counter white violence. Most famously, Malcolm X joins the Nation of Islam and he emphasized black nationalism, self-improvement, and separatism. So you have the radicalization of some segments of the civil rights movement. Malcolm X unfortunately will be assassinated in 1965 by members of the Nation of Islam.

But other groups are going to pop up. You have the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -- Stokely Carmichael -- who's really going to call for black power -- economic power for African-Americans, racial separatism. And you have in Oakland, California a group of people called the Black Panthers founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. Once again, this radicalization of the movement is very often times calling for self-rule for African-Americans. They were much more militant, and as a result they say non-violent protests are not the best path to full equality.

It's important to keep in mind that all of these events are taking place at the same time the US involvement in Vietnam is increasing. In 1954 while President Eisenhower was still in office, the French lose the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and abandon Vietnam. The US was giving lots of money to France in their effort to recolonize Vietnam. Following the French removal, the US involvement increases under President Eisenhower. We continue to give support to the unpopular leader -- because he was non-communist -- of South Vietnam named Diem. There's Eisenhower and Diem shaking some hands.

When Kennedy takes office in 1961, he continues to increase and escalate US involvement. Military advisers are sent into the South to protect the Diem regime. The regime continues to become unpopular. Diem is assassinated. And when Johnson takes power, you have an event -- a really important event -- in 1964 called the Gulf of Tonkin incident. LBJ claims the US ship was attacked by North Vietnamese in the Gulf of Tonkin. There are huge questions as to whether or not that attack even took place.

And the Gulf of Tonkin incident leads to Congress issuing a blank check for LBJ to send ground troops into Vietnam. And we begin the bulk of the fighting in South Vietnam against the communist forces. For 3 years, the US public was told that the war was going well -- that the war was almost over. And in 1968 during the Tet Offensive -- a surprise attack by North Vietnam into the South during the Vietnamese New Year -- shocks the American public because it reveals the war is nowhere near being over and the government was in fact misleading the American people.

Anti-war protests intensify even more so after 1968. There was already questions about the war before, but Tet just increases those questions. And really important point to keep in mind when studying the '60s is there's a variety of movements emerging during this period. The Vietnam War deeply divided the nation between hawks who were pro-war and doves who are anti-war. The war also distracted and took away funds from the Great Society and really ruins the presidency of Lyndon Johnson.

And you have huge anti-war protests taking place especially on college campuses. In fact, on college campuses such as UC Berkeley, you have the Free Speech Movement developing. You have groups like the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) -- they issued the Port Huron Statement -- and other New Left movements spread across college campuses as many people began joining the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, and a variety of movements taking place.

Betty Friedan -- remember -- wrote the book "The Feminine Mystique," and later on she would help co-found the National Organization for Women (NOW). Her group and others would campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment. It eventually gets defeated in the early '70s, but you have the rise of the feminist and women's rights movement in American society.

And in 1969 you have the Stonewall riots when police harassing gay patrons of a place called Stonewall resist. And the Stonewall riots gave rise to the modern gay rights movement in American society. You're also going to have other movements amongst Latinos, American Indians, and Asian-Americans as they also began to demand social and economic equality.

All right everyone, that's a real quick overview of a very complex time in American history. Make sure you do your reading, check out my other videos. If the video helped you, click like. Peace.
