== 释义

Welcome back to another installment 部分；章节 of the ultimate APUSH review. Today we are taking a look at APUSH period 4 which goes from 1800 to 1848, and today we got it reviewed for you.

So real quick, the Big Ideas really simplified: the role and relationship between the federal and state governments will continue to evolve 发展；演变 during this time, so you're going to see this theme 主题 in today's presentation. Two, this era 时代 will experience rapid economic, territorial 领土的, and demographic 人口的 changes -- the United States is going to be going through change in all three of those categories 类别. Sectionalism 地方主义；区域主义 will increase during this time -- it's always been an issue, it's going to continue to be an issue in period 4. The new Republic will both extend 扩大；延伸 democratic rights 民主权利 and continue to struggle to define and extend democratic ideals 民主理想 to all Americans. Translation 解释；意译: some Americans are going to see the right to vote 选举权 suddenly, and others are going to continue to be denied 被剥夺 that. And then finally, various reform movements 改革运动 will seek to 试图；力求 change American society.

So let's take a look. Kind of one of the important points you're going to see is America is expanding its territory. The size of the United States is going to more than double during this period. In fact, the US will attempt to increase our foreign trade 对外贸易, expand our borders 边界, and at the same time -- especially after the War of 1812 -- attempt to isolate ourselves from foreign affairs 外交事务. This will make way more sense in just a moment.

So let's take a look. If you look at a map of America in 1790, the population density 人口密度 was kind of hugging along 沿着……延伸 the Atlantic Seaboard 大西洋沿岸, and you see this change because by 1830 the population is moving west. You know, you still got these population centers 人口中心 like Boston and Philadelphia, but people are moving west with increasing frequency 频率. And there's a lot of different reasons for it. One, the population's growing through natural population growth 自然人口增长 -- birth rate 出生率 is allowing the population of the United States to increase. You also have this huge amount of immigration 移民 coming, especially around 1830 and especially 1840 -- the number of immigrants increase, and the people who are coming are different. The number one group is the Irish, number two is the Germans, and then number three are English immigrants as well as others.

Transportation improvements 交通改善 allow this western expansion 西部扩张 to take place 发生 as well. You know, we have this Transportation Revolution 交通革命 with canal building 运河修建, the First National Road -- the Cumberland Road 坎伯兰公路 -- and eventually of course the big one: railroads 铁路 in the 1830s and 40s. So transportation improvements allow this western expansion. And then with Eli Whitney's cotton gin 轧棉机 invented in the 1790s, cotton production 棉花产量 is going to increase, and Southerners are looking for more and more land. And with the increase of cotton production, unfortunately goes the increase of slavery 奴隶制, and it's going to be moving west into places like Alabama and Mississippi and Missouri.

Other reasons for this western expansion are threats are removed from the continent 大陆. For instance, Napoleon was kind of hoping to create a French Empire once again on the North American continent, but that all goes -- you know, disappears -- because in 1803 Jefferson gets Louisiana Purchase 路易斯安那购地案, doubling the size of the US without having to go to war. Remember in the War of 1812, once again England and US round two -- we fight and we are able to fight to a stalemate 僵局. We don't defeat England, but we stand up to 抵抗；反对 them again, and we get those British forts 堡垒 that had been kind of hanging out since the Treaty of Paris after the American Revolution -- we get rid of 摆脱；除去 those once and for all 彻底地. And then in 1819, we reach a deal with Spain -- the Adams-Onís Treaty 亚当斯 - 奥尼斯条约 -- where Spain agrees to sell us Florida. So we're able to move west, our boundaries are expanding. And of course, the sad reality: this is going to take place as a result of many Native American defeats 失败, and we'll take a look at that in just a moment. In fact, right now.

So if you look at a map, this is kind of roughly land loss 土地丧失 by native people up until 1783, and that same land by around 1850 -- it's a rapid decline 下降 in the amount of native land. And there's a whole bunch of events, and we'll kind of briefly highlight 突出；强调 a few of the key ones for APUSH period 4. One, the Battle of Tippecanoe 蒂珀卡努战役 -- Tecumseh is defeated by William Henry Harrison just before the War of 1812. You have the First Seminole War 第一次塞米诺尔战争 which takes place in 1817 - 1818 where the natives once again are defeated. And tragic events 悲剧事件 surrounding the Indian Removal Act 印第安人迁移法案 -- the ignoring of the Supreme Court 最高法院 by Andrew Jackson -- and of course finally the Trail of Tears 血泪之路 where the so - called Five Civilized Tribes 所谓的五大文明部落 will be removed from the territory 领土.

Now, couple of kind of things to keep in mind. Remember in this period you also have this struggle for neutrality 中立. Even before 1800, Washington and Adams had been trying to stay neutral from the war -- the Napoleonic Wars 拿破仑战争. And we had the Chesapeake - Leopard Affair 切萨皮克号 - 豹号事件 in 1807 where England attacks our ship the Chesapeake. We have the Embargo 禁运 which is a big epic failure -- you can't trade with anybody -- and it's replaced by the Non - Intercourse Act 禁止通商法 in 1809, and eventually Macon's Bill Number Two 梅肯法案二号, which all of those are unable to really preserve 维护 American neutrality, which leads eventually to the War of 1812.

And there's a lot of reasons why we have the War of 1812. You know, we want to defend our neutrality from impressment 强制征兵, we want to defend our national honor 国家荣誉. There's also those continued forts on US soil. Tecumseh and his brother are being supplied by the British with guns which are then being used against Americans on the frontier 边境. And of course some of those War Hawks 好战分子 like Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun are talking about why don't we expand our territory and take Canada. And eventually we have the War of 1812 under James Madison which leads eventually to the Treaty of Ghent 根特条约, and all is settled once again between us and our former mother country 母国.

Key concept 关键概念 in the APUSH standards: the US will seek to expand its global presence 全球影响力 by focusing its expansion on the North American continent and continuing to promote foreign trade. So kind of some highlights 亮点 for this is of course the Louisiana Purchase -- I already mentioned. Jefferson goes to war rather than pay tribute to 向……进贡 the Barbary Pirates 巴巴里海盗 -- he goes to war, uses the Navy which he criticized under Adams to fight the Barbary Pirates. The War of 1812 preserves our neutrality. The Rush - Bagot Treaty of 1817 拉什 - 巴戈特条约 -- Secretary of State 国务卿 John Quincy Adams helps negotiate 谈判 an agreement where England and the US agreed to disarm 解除武装 the Great Lakes region 五大湖地区, possibly preventing a war. The British - American Convention 英美公约 in 1818 is a joint agreement 联合协议 between the US and England where we agree we will jointly occupy 共同占领 Oregon for 10 years, the northern boundary of the Louisiana Territory will be set at the 49th parallel 北纬49度线, and we'll agree to go on some nice fishing trips in the Newfoundland region -- we'll share that section for fishing. Adams - Onís Treaty will buy Florida from Spain. Monroe Doctrine 门罗主义 of 1823 -- we basically tell Europe: stay the heck out of 远离 the Western Hemisphere 西半球, no more colonies 殖民地, we won't intervene in 干涉 your affairs, you stay the heck out of ours. No way we could enforce 执行 it, but England was down with 同意 it, so they never really test the Monroe Doctrine. The Lone Star Republic 孤星共和国 is established in 1836 -- Texans kind of declared their independence from Mexico, causes all sorts of controversy 争议. No one wants to annex 吞并 Texas because of the whole issue of slavery, so Texas will be its own country for a brief period. Things will be covered in period five but actually fall in the framework 框架 of period 4: the election of Polk, Manifest Destiny 天定命运论, Oregon, Texas, and of course the biggie 重要事件 -- the Mexican - American War 美墨战争, but we'll cover that next time.

Kind of one of the key ideas happening during this time period as well is rise of nationalism 民族主义. And really you see cultural nationalism 文化民族主义 where patriotic themes 爱国主题 can be seen in art, literature, and other forms. So you have the Hudson River School 哈德逊河画派 where people are painting these landscape paintings 风景画 of the Hudson River Valley 哈德逊河谷 celebrating the natural beauty of the North American continent. You have men like John James Audubon studying the birds of North America. So you have all this kind of cultural nationalism.

After the War of 1812, economic nationalism 经济民族主义 can best be seen in the American System 美国体系 by Henry Clay where he talks about the need for the Second Bank of the United States 美国第二银行 -- it's reestablished, rechartered 重新特许 in 1816. You have the protective tariff 保护性关税 where the tariff's goal was to protect American industry 美国工业 and also help fund 资助 transportation improvements, which is the third part of the American system. So this idea of developing the economy of the United States.

Political nationalism 政治民族主义 we can also see -- there's only one political party 政党 after the war, it is the Democratic - Republican party 民主共和党. The Federalists 联邦党人 were already kind of fading away 逐渐消失 -- the Hartford Convention 哈特福德会议 hurts them -- and you have one political party, and we get this called the Era of Good Feelings 和睦时代. And they do adopt some Federalist ideas -- even before this time period the Republicans were adopting some Federalist ideas -- but they're still will be disputes 争议 over things like the tariff and slavery, the bank, so it's not exactly all good feelings politics between these 1800 to 1848.

Of course you have the election of 1800 -- the first peaceful transition of power 和平权力交接 with the election of Jefferson. The Era of Good Feelings -- kind of the election of Monroe is kind of seen as the start, and it kind of starts to fall apart 瓦解 after the Panic of 1819 1819年恐慌. One political party -- Federalists are gone. Of course not all good feelings because there are factions 派别 within the Republican party -- they have disagreements over issues like slavery and tariffs. And all of it will kind of just crumble 崩溃 with the election of 1824 and the so - called corrupt bargain 腐败交易 when John Quincy Adams becomes president following a disputed election 有争议的选举, and suddenly Henry Clay becomes Secretary of State. And you have this period of political tension 政治紧张局势 all throughout this period.

Historians have kind of pointed it out as the Age of the Common Man 普通人的时代 as new state laws are passed which allow for more white men to vote, and so property requirements 财产要求 are done away with 废除. And so you have this huge increase in the number of people participating in the electoral process 选举过程. And of course in 1828, you get the election of Andrew Jackson in a rematch 复赛；重赛 against John Quincy Adams. And during Jackson's presidency 总统任期, you have the rise of the second two - party system 第二政党制度 where under Andrew Jackson -- the Democrats 民主党人 versus 与……相对 the Whigs 辉格党人 -- and the Whigs are going to be the opponents 对手 of Andrew Jackson.

As you can see on this map, kind of reviewing really quickly the political kind of developments during this time period: the Revolution of 1800 -- the election of Jefferson; Hartford Convention -- the moment the Federalists kind of put the final nail into their coffin 敲响丧钟; followed by the Era of Good Feelings -- one political party, they are all Republicans (of course that's not exactly completely true, it is a simplified version); then the corrupt bargain; and then eventually you get the Democratic party which are similar to the old school Democratic - Republicans, and the Whig party which have a lot of similarities to the Federalists in terms of their beliefs 信仰.

Denied: there are going to be people who are denied or left out of 被排除在外 this new national culture 国家文化. In fact, women are going to see their roles restricted 受到限制. There's this idea of the cult of domesticity 家庭崇拜 -- a woman's place was in the domestic sphere 家庭领域. Of course as the nation became a republic, there was this idea of Republican Motherhood 共和母亲理念 where women should raise good citizens to be active in the democratic process 民主进程, especially their young sons. And a big historic event takes place in 1848 when you have at Seneca Falls 塞尼卡福尔斯 the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments 权利和意见宣言 where women outline 概述 their grievances 不满 towards the country and demand full equal rights 完全平等的权利.

For African Americans, we're going to take a look at them a little bit more closely in a moment, but you're going to see the rise of the pro - slavery arguments 支持奴隶制的论点, racism 种族主义 in both the North and the South, and the complete exclusion 完全排斥 of African - Americans from this national culture. And Native people -- once again, native resistance 抵抗 will be met by force removal 强制迁移 by the government of the United States.

Big idea in this period as we move west: it's essential 至关重要的 you understand the rise of sectionalism. In spite of 尽管 this increase in nationalism, sectionalism will continue to plague 困扰 the nation. You're going to have the Northeast, the North, the West, and the South, and they're going to all pursue their own kind of agendas 议程. In fact, state governments at this time will also resist the authority of the federal government 联邦政府的权威, and you could see that in two great examples: the North at the Hartford Convention in 1814 -- New England Federalists are going to consider possible secession 脱离；分裂 due to their anger and resentment 愤怒和不满 about the War of 1812. However, the war was over by the time their plot 阴谋 comes to the surface 暴露, and the Federalists fade away. Kind of more significant is what happens in the South with the nullification crisis 否决权危机 in 1828 to 1832 -- South Carolina votes to nullify 否决 the Tariff of 1828 and 1832, creating a serious problem. And Jackson as the president sends federal troops 联邦军队, and eventually you get the Compromise Tariff of 1833 1833年妥协关税, also known as the olive branch and the sword 橄榄枝与剑. So state governments are going to be resisting the federal government at times, and once again that idea of sectionalism -- so important in spite of this increase in nationalism, sectionalism will continue to plague the nation.

We've seen some of these examples, but quick review: the Second Bank of the United States -- supported by the North, opposed by the South. Internal transportation improvements 国内交通改善 -- heavily favored by the West, but states' rights supporters 州权支持者 oppose the spending of federal money on internal improvements. Protective Tariff of 1816 is going to be supported by Northern manufacturers 北方制造商, resisted by Southerners. Very often, the Missouri issue 密苏里问题 is going to be a hugely complicated sectional crisis 地区危机 because it's going to divide the North and the South -- should slavery expand into new states? And it's temporarily going to be solved by the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协 where they make Missouri a slave state 蓄奴州, Maine a free state 自由州, and they cut off slavery north of 36°30'. The nullification issue we've already mentioned where South Carolina is going to resist the Tariff of 1828, and other Southern states are going to kind of morally support South Carolina. And Andrew Jackson of course is going to respond with the olive branch and the sword. And then of course a big problem is going to happen with the National Bank debate 国家银行辩论 where Jackson is going to veto 否决 the rechartering of the bank, and you're going to have the rise of pet banks 受宠银行. This is going to be an issue that's going to also to some degree divide Northerners and Southerners.

In spite of the sectionalism though, you see this commitment to the union 联邦. In fact, when Daniel Webster and Robert Hayne debate in 1830, it is Daniel Webster who rejects the idea that a state could defy 违抗 or leave the union. Andrew Jackson also rejects that when he puts the smackdown on 镇压 South Carolina during the Nullification Crisis in 1832. So there is this commitment to the union, but there is sectional tension 地区紧张局势.

In spite of this kind of effort by states and different sections of the country to kind of pursue their goals, the Supreme Court 最高法院 will increase the power of the federal government during this time. We saw it -- John Marshall, kind of the Federalist judge 联邦党法官. Marbury v. Madison 马伯里诉麦迪逊案 -- the importance of judicial review 司法审查 -- they established that precedent 先例. McCulloch v. Maryland 麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案 -- the court rules the Second Bank of the US is constitutional 符合宪法的, therefore saying the federal government can create the bank. And another case -- Gibbons v. Ogden 吉本斯诉奥格登案 -- states do not regulate interstate commerce 州际贸易, trade between states -- the federal government does. So all of these different cases during John Marshall's tenure 任期 as the Chief Justice 首席大法官 are going to further 增强 the power of the federal government.

Regional sectional identity 地区特征 of the South -- a couple things you should keep in mind: the cotton gin is invented in 1793 -- it's going to transform 改变 cotton production. Slave ownership 奴隶占有 was a sign of status 地位的象征, and in the South you have the kind of rise of this aristocratic plantation class 贵族种植园主阶层. Those people had the wealth. The majority of Southerners did not own slaves yet supported the institution of slavery 奴隶制 -- only about 25% of Southerners actually owned any slaves at all. But there was this hope of one day they themselves would own slaves as well. They have this code of chivalry 骑士精神 in the South -- this strong sense of honor 荣誉感 among Southerners. And as Northerners became critical of slavery and slave revolts 奴隶起义 were taking place, Southerners became very defensive of the institution of slavery. In fact, you see George Fitzhugh defending slavery as a positive good 有益之事 -- it was better than the factory labor in the North. And in some instances, you see the use of religion to defend slavery.

Amongst African - Americans, the experiences were mixed 复杂的 depending upon where they were, but life under slavery sucked 糟糕 no matter who you were. Slaves relied on extended or surrogate families 大家庭或代际家庭 to kind of maintain emotional bonds 维系情感纽带 with one another to resist the inhumanity of slavery 奴隶制的不人道. During the Second Great Awakening 第二次大觉醒, there's the importance of the slave spiritual 奴隶的宗教音乐 -- slave music and religion. Many slaves during the first and second Great Awakening take on Christianity 皈依基督教 like becoming Methodists 卫理公会教徒, and the importance of fusing 融合 African religions with Christianity, and you get these kind of hybrid faiths 混合信仰. Slave resistance 奴隶反抗 plays a key role -- you're going to have all sorts of different ways that slaves are going to show their unhappiness with the institution: sabotage 蓄意破坏, destroying things, destroying tools, running away, work slowdowns 怠工, and the most obvious one is going to be rebellions 起义. And Denmark Vesey 丹麦·维西 is an example in 1822 in Virginia -- his rebellion is going to be betrayed 背叛, and he is, along with his supporters, going to be killed before the rebellion can take place. Nat Turner 纳特·特纳 is going to have some luck in 1831 -- he is going to rebel. Unfortunately for Nat Turner and his followers, after the rebellion takes place, eventually they are captured and killed as well. And these rebellions and the threat of rebellions leave Southern states to pass stricter slave codes 奴隶法典.

There is going to be a growing abolitionist movement 废奴运动 in the North. There is going to be a free black population 自由黑人人口 in the North and the South with severe restrictions 严格限制 on them in both places. And you're going to get individuals like David Walker -- his famous Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World 1829年《向世界有色公民的呼吁》 in 1829, basically talking about the importance of fighting back against the inhumanity of slavery. Other abolitionist movements: the American Colonization Society 美国殖民协会 -- their whole plan was to eventually slowly free slaves and send freed slaves to Africa. You also get individuals like William Lloyd Garrison 威廉·劳埃德·加里森 -- the American Anti - Slavery Society 美国反奴隶制协会 he creates, calling for immediate uncompensated emancipation 立即无偿解放 in his famous newspaper The Liberator 《解放者》. And a lot of other individuals such as Frederick Douglass 弗雷德里克·道格拉斯 and so on.

There's also going to be a unique regional identity of the North. While the South is relying on Southern agriculture 南方农业 and especially slave labor 奴隶劳动, you're going to see the rise of manufacturing 制造业 in the North. Samuel Slater 塞缪尔·斯莱特 known as the father of the factory system 工厂制度之父, the growth of cities. Eli Whitney's interchangeable parts 可互换零件 allows for mass production 大规模生产 in factories. The steam engine 蒸汽机 -- produced, developed by Robert Fulton 罗伯特·富尔顿 with the Clermont 克莱蒙特号 -- allows for transportation costs to be cheaper. The Lowell factory system 洛厄尔工厂制度 in Lowell, Massachusetts worked by New England farm daughters, later Irish immigrants. All of this is kind of changing the economy of the North. You have the court case Commonwealth v. Hunt 亨特诉州政府案 where the state supreme court rules that labor unions 工会 are allowed. And as a result of these opportunities and the factory system, immigrants are coming into the US -- the Irish, the Germans, the English, and every other group that was coming -- and they tended to settle in the North or in the Midwest farm regions 中西部农场地区. And you get these immigrants coming in. And of course with that, you see the rise of nativist groups 本土主义团体 such as the Know - Nothing Party 一无所知党 who is anti - immigrant 反移民的, especially Irish immigrant.

Keep in mind although these two regions are developing unique characteristics, the economic activities of the South and North were linked together 相互关联. Southern cotton provided the raw material 原材料 for manufacturing in the Northeast.

And also closing out in this period of time, you have the Second Great Awakening take place -- Charles Finney 查尔斯·芬尼 and the religious revivalism 宗教复兴主义, this idea of spiritual reform 精神改革 from within. And these awakenings are sweeping the frontier 边疆, and huge number of conversions 皈依 and religious revivalism. But also during this time period, you have various social reform movements 社会改革运动. You have the temperance movement 戒酒运动 -- the American Temperance Society 美国戒酒协会 trying to get people to stop drinking. You have prison reform 监狱改革 by Dorothea Dix 多萝西娅·迪克斯. You have the abolitionist movement -- people like Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, David Walker, and many many others. You have women's rights movement 妇女权利运动 -- Seneca Falls we've seen. Education in the North in Massachusetts with Horace Mann 贺拉斯·曼. And a whole bunch of utopian societies 乌托邦社会 -- some religious such as the Mormons 摩门教徒 and the Shakers 震颤派教徒, others like Brook Farm 布鲁克农场 where they're trying to create these model idealistic communities 理想社区 to reform society.

All right everybody, that's going to do it today. Passing APUSH is hard work -- hopefully this video on period 4 made it just a little bit easier. And if you're confused with anything, post a comment. If you thought the video helped you out even just a little bit, hit that little thumbs up guy 点赞. And if you haven't already done so, subscribe to Joe Productions -- we're always making new videos and we love the support. And if after a long day of studying for APUSH you find yourself looking like this, take a break, go look at some blue skies, and have a beautiful day. Peace!

欢迎回到另一期终极APUSH复习。今天我们来看一下1800年至1848年的APUSH第四时期，今天我们已经为你们复习好了。

那么，快速地，核心思想非常简化：联邦政府和州政府之间的角色和关系在此期间将继续演变，所以你们将在今天的演示中看到这个主题。第二，这个时代将经历快速的经济、领土和人口变化——美国将在所有这三个方面发生变化。地区主义在此期间将加剧——它一直是一个问题，在第四时期将继续是一个问题。新的共和国将扩大民主权利，并继续努力为所有美国人定义和扩展民主理想。翻译：一些美国人将突然获得投票权，而另一些人将继续被剥夺这种权利。最后，各种改革运动将寻求改变美国社会。

那么，让我们来看一下。你们将看到的一个重要观点是，美国正在扩张其领土。在此期间，美国的面积将增加一倍以上。事实上，美国将试图增加我们的对外贸易，扩大我们的边界，同时——尤其是在1812年战争之后——试图将自己与外国事务隔离开来。这一点稍后会更加清楚。

那么，让我们来看一下。如果你们看一下1790年的美国地图，人口密度主要集中在大西洋沿岸，你们会看到这种变化，因为到1830年，人口正在向西迁移。你们知道，仍然有像波士顿和费城这样的人口中心，但人们正以越来越高的频率向西迁移。这有很多不同的原因。第一，人口通过自然增长而增长——出生率使得美国人口能够增加。你们也有大量的移民涌入，尤其是在1830年左右，特别是1840年——移民人数增加，而且来的人也不同。第一大群体是爱尔兰人，第二大群体是德国人，然后第三大群体是英国移民以及其他人。

交通运输的改善也使得这种西扩得以发生。你们知道，我们经历了交通运输革命，包括运河建设、第一条国家公路——坎伯兰公路——以及最终最重要的：1830年代和1840年代的铁路。因此，交通运输的改善使得这种西扩成为可能。然后，随着伊莱·惠特尼在1790年代发明轧棉机，棉花产量将增加，南方人正在寻找越来越多的土地。随着棉花产量的增加，不幸的是，奴隶制也在增加，并将向西迁移到阿拉巴马州、密西西比州和密苏里州等地。

这种西扩的其他原因是，来自大陆的威胁被消除了。例如，拿破仑曾希望在北美大陆再次建立一个法兰西帝国，但这一切都消失了——你们知道——因为在1803年，杰斐逊获得了路易斯安那购地，使美国的面积增加了一倍，而无需发动战争。记住在1812年战争中，英国和美国再次交手——我们战斗，我们能够打成僵局。我们没有击败英国，但我们再次抵抗了他们，我们摆脱了自美国革命后《巴黎条约》以来一直存在的英国堡垒。然后在1819年，我们与西班牙达成协议——《亚当斯-奥尼斯条约》——西班牙同意将佛罗里达卖给我们。因此，我们能够向西迁移，我们的边界正在扩大。当然，令人悲伤的现实是：这一切都将发生在许多美洲原住民战败之后，我们稍后会讨论这一点。事实上，现在就讨论。

所以，如果你们看一下地图，这大致是到1783年当地人民的土地损失情况，而到1850年左右，同样的土地——当地土地的数量急剧下降。发生了一系列事件，我们将简要地强调APUSH第四时期的一些关键事件。第一，蒂珀卡努战役——在1812年战争前不久，特库姆塞被威廉·亨利·哈里森击败。你们有1817-1818年发生的第一次塞米诺尔战争，当地人再次被击败。以及围绕《印第安人迁移法案》的悲剧事件——安德鲁·杰克逊无视最高法院——当然还有最后的血泪之路，所谓的五个文明部落将被从他们的领土上驱逐出去。

现在，记住几件事。记住在这个时期，你们也有这种中立的斗争。甚至在1800年之前，华盛顿和亚当斯一直试图在战争——拿破仑战争——中保持中立。我们在1807年发生了切萨皮克-豹号事件，英国袭击了我们的船只切萨皮克号。我们有禁运法，这是一个巨大的失败——你们不能与任何人进行贸易——它在1809年被《不交往法案》取代，最终是梅肯法案第二号，所有这些都无法真正维护美国的中立，最终导致了1812年战争。

我们发生1812年战争有很多原因。你们知道，我们想捍卫我们的中立免受强征，我们想捍卫我们的国家荣誉。美国领土上仍然有那些堡垒。特库姆塞和他的兄弟得到了英国提供的枪支，这些枪支随后被用来对付边疆的美国人。当然，像亨利·克莱和约翰·C·卡尔霍恩这样的战争鹰派正在谈论为什么我们不扩张我们的领土并占领加拿大。最终，我们在詹姆斯·麦迪逊领导下进行了1812年战争，最终导致了《根特条约》，我们和我们以前的母国之间的所有问题再次得到解决。

APUSH标准中的关键概念：美国将通过专注于北美大陆的扩张并继续促进对外贸易来寻求扩大其全球影响力。这方面的一些重点当然是路易斯安那购地——我已经提到了。杰斐逊宁愿开战也不愿向巴巴里海盗进贡——他开战了，使用了他在亚当斯政府时期批评过的海军来对抗巴巴里海盗。1812年战争维护了我们的中立。1817年的《拉什-巴戈特条约》——国务卿约翰·昆西·亚当斯帮助谈判达成一项协议，英国和美国同意解除大湖地区的武装，可能避免了一场战争。1818年的《英美公约》是美国和英国之间的一项联合协议，我们同意共同占领俄勒冈10年，路易斯安那领地的北部边界将设定在北纬49度，我们将同意在纽芬兰地区进行一些愉快的捕鱼之旅——我们将共享该地区的捕鱼权。《亚当斯-奥尼斯条约》将从西班牙购买佛罗里达。1823年的《门罗主义》——我们基本上告诉欧洲：远离西半球，不再有殖民地，我们不会干预你们的事务，你们也远离我们的事务。我们根本无法强制执行它，但英国同意了，所以他们从未真正考验过《门罗主义》。孤星共和国于1836年建立——德克萨斯人宣布脱离墨西哥独立，引起了各种争议。由于奴隶制问题，没有人愿意吞并德克萨斯，所以德克萨斯将在短时间内成为一个独立的国家。第五时期将涵盖一些事情，但实际上属于第四时期的框架：波尔克的当选、昭昭天命、俄勒冈、德克萨斯，当然还有最重要的——美墨战争，但我们下次再讨论。

这一时期发生的一个关键思想是民族主义的兴起。实际上，你们看到了文化民族主义，爱国主义的主题可以在艺术、文学和其他形式中看到。因此，你们有了哈德逊河画派，人们绘制哈德逊河谷的风景画，赞美北美大陆的自然美景。你们有像约翰·詹姆斯·奥杜邦这样的人研究北美洲的鸟类。因此，你们拥有所有这些文化民族主义。

1812年战争之后，经济民族主义最好体现在亨利·克莱的美国体系中，他谈到了美国第二银行的必要性——它在1816年重新建立并获得新的特许权。你们有关税保护，关税的目标是保护美国工业并帮助资助交通运输的改善，这是美国体系的第三部分。因此，这是发展美国经济的思想。

我们也可以看到政治民族主义——战争结束后只有一个政党，那就是民主共和党。联邦党人已经逐渐衰落——哈特福德会议损害了他们——你们只有一个政党，我们称之为“美好时代”。他们确实采纳了一些联邦党人的思想——甚至在此之前，共和党人也在采纳一些联邦党人的思想——但他们仍然会在关税和奴隶制、银行等问题上存在争议，因此在1800年至1848年之间，政治并非完全是美好时代。

当然，你们有1800年的选举——杰斐逊当选后的第一次和平权力交接。“美好时代”——门罗的当选通常被认为是开始，但在1819年恐慌之后开始瓦解。一个政党——联邦党人消失了。当然，并非一切都美好，因为共和党内部存在派系——他们在奴隶制和关税等问题上存在分歧。这一切都将在1824年的选举以及约翰·昆西·亚当斯在有争议的选举后成为总统，而亨利·克莱突然成为国务卿的所谓的腐败交易中崩溃。你们在这个时期一直存在政治紧张。

历史学家将其指出为“平民时代”，因为新的州法律通过，允许更多的白人男性投票，因此财产要求被废除了。因此，参与选举过程的人数大幅增加。当然，在1828年，你们看到了安德鲁·杰克逊在与约翰·昆西·亚当斯的重赛中当选。在杰克逊担任总统期间，你们看到了第二次两党制的兴起——在安德鲁·杰克逊领导下的民主党对阵辉格党——辉格党将成为安德鲁·杰克逊的反对者。

正如你们在这张地图上看到的，快速回顾一下这一时期的政治发展：1800年革命——杰斐逊当选；哈特福德会议——联邦党人基本上敲响了他们棺材的最后一颗钉子；随后是美好时代——一个政党，他们都是共和党人（当然这并不完全正确，这是一个简化版本）；然后是腐败交易；最终你们有了民主党，他们类似于老派的民主共和党人，而辉格党在他们的信仰方面与联邦党人有很多相似之处。

被剥夺权利者：将有一些人被剥夺或排除在这个新的民族文化之外。事实上，妇女的角色将受到限制。存在着家庭崇拜的思想——妇女的地位在家庭领域。当然，随着国家成为共和国，存在着共和母性的思想，妇女应该培养好公民，积极参与民主进程，尤其是她们的幼子。1848年发生了一件重大的历史事件，在塞内卡瀑布会议上，妇女们发表了《权利与情感宣言》，其中概述了她们对国家的不满，并要求完全平等的权利。

对于非裔美国人，我们稍后会更仔细地研究他们，但你们将看到亲奴隶制论点的兴起，北方和南方的种族主义，以及非裔美国人完全被排除在这个民族文化之外。而当地人民——再一次，当地的抵抗将遭到美国政府的武力驱逐。

随着我们向西迁移，这一时期的核心思想：你们必须理解地区主义的兴起。尽管民族主义有所增强，但地区主义将继续困扰这个国家。你们将有东北部、北部、西部和南部，他们都将追求各自的议程。事实上，当时的州政府也会抵制联邦政府的权威，你们可以在两个伟大的例子中看到这一点：1814年北方在哈特福德会议上——新英格兰联邦党人将考虑由于他们对1812年战争的愤怒和不满而可能发生的脱离联邦。然而，当他们的阴谋浮出水面时，战争已经结束，联邦党人逐渐消失。更重要的是1828年至1832年南方发生的废止危机——南卡罗来纳州投票废止1828年和1832年的关税，造成了严重的问题。杰克逊总统派遣联邦军队，最终你们有了1833年的妥协关税，也称为橄榄枝和剑。因此，州政府有时会抵制联邦政府，再一次，地区主义的思想——尽管民族主义有所增强，但地区主义仍然非常重要，它将继续困扰这个国家。

我们已经看过一些这样的例子，但快速回顾一下：美国第二银行——北方支持，南方反对。国内交通运输改善——西部强烈支持，但州权支持者反对联邦资金用于国内改善。1816年的保护性关税将得到北方制造商的支持，而南方人则抵制。通常，密苏里问题将是一个非常复杂的地区危机，因为它将分裂北方和南方——奴隶制是否应该扩展到新的州？它将通过密苏里妥协暂时解决，该妥协使密苏里成为奴隶州，缅因州成为自由州，并将奴隶制限制在北纬36°30′以北。我们已经提到了废止问题，南卡罗来纳州将抵制1828年的关税，其他南方州将在道义上支持南卡罗来纳州。安德鲁·杰克逊当然将以橄榄枝和剑回应。当然，一个大问题将是国家银行的辩论，杰克逊将否决银行的重新特许，你们将看到宠物银行的兴起。这个问题将在某种程度上分裂北方人和南方人。

然而，尽管存在地区主义，你们仍然看到了对联邦的承诺。事实上，当丹尼尔·韦伯斯特和罗伯特·海恩在1830年辩论时，是丹尼尔·韦伯斯特拒绝了一个州可以蔑视或脱离联邦的想法。安德鲁·杰克逊在1832年废止危机期间对南卡罗来纳州采取强硬态度时也拒绝了这一点。因此，存在着对联邦的承诺，但也存在地区紧张。

尽管各州和国家不同地区为追求各自目标做出了努力，但最高法院在此期间将增加联邦政府的权力。我们看到了——约翰·马歇尔，这位联邦党法官。《马伯里诉麦迪逊案》——司法审查的重要性——他们确立了这一先例。《麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案》——法院裁定美国第二银行符合宪法，因此表明联邦政府可以创建银行。另一个案件——《吉本斯诉奥格登案》——各州不监管州际贸易，即州与州之间的贸易——联邦政府监管。因此，约翰·马歇尔担任首席大法官期间的所有这些不同案件都将进一步扩大联邦政府的权力。

南方地区的地区特性——你们应该记住几件事：轧棉机于1793年发明——它将改变棉花生产。拥有奴隶是地位的象征，在南方，你们看到了这种贵族种植园阶级的兴起。这些人拥有财富。大多数南方人并不拥有奴隶，但支持奴隶制——实际上只有大约25%的南方人拥有任何奴隶。但他们希望有一天自己也能拥有奴隶。南方有这种骑士精神——南方人之间强烈的荣誉感。随着北方人批评奴隶制和奴隶起义的发生，南方人变得非常维护奴隶制。事实上，你们看到乔治·菲茨休将奴隶制辩护为一种积极的善——它比北方的工厂劳动要好。在某些情况下，你们看到利用宗教来捍卫奴隶制。

在非裔美国人中，他们的经历因所处地区而异，但无论你们是谁，奴隶制下的生活都很糟糕。奴隶依靠大家庭或代孕家庭来维持彼此之间的情感联系，以抵抗奴隶制的不人道。在第二次大觉醒期间，奴隶灵歌——奴隶音乐和宗教非常重要。在第一次和第二次大觉醒期间，许多奴隶接受了基督教，例如成为卫理公会教徒，非洲宗教与基督教的融合非常重要，你们看到了这些混合信仰。奴隶抵抗发挥了关键作用——你们将看到奴隶以各种不同的方式表达他们对这种制度的不满：破坏、毁坏东西、毁坏工具、逃跑、怠工，最明显的是叛乱。丹麦·维西是1822年弗吉尼亚州的一个例子——他的叛乱将被出卖，他和他的支持者将在叛乱发生前被杀害。纳特·特纳在1831年取得了一些成功——他将发动叛乱。不幸的是，对于纳特·特纳和他的追随者来说，在叛乱发生后，他们最终也被抓获并杀害。这些叛乱和叛乱的威胁导致南方各州通过更严格的奴隶法。

北方将出现日益壮大的废奴运动。在北方和南方都将存在自由黑人人口，他们在两地都受到严格的限制。你们将看到像大卫·沃克这样的人——他在1829年发表了著名的《致世界有色公民的呼吁》，基本上谈到了反击奴隶制不人道行为的重要性。其他废奴运动：美国殖民协会——他们的整个计划是最终缓慢地解放奴隶并将获释的奴隶送往非洲。你们还会看到像威廉·劳埃德·加里森这样的人——他创建了美国反奴隶制协会，在他的著名报纸《解放者》中呼吁立即无偿解放奴隶。还有许多其他人，例如弗雷德里克·道格拉斯等等。

北方也将形成独特的地域特性。当南方依赖南方农业，特别是奴隶劳动时，你们将在北方看到制造业的兴起。被称为工厂制度之父的塞缪尔·斯莱特，城市的增长。伊莱·惠特尼的可互换零件使得工厂能够进行大规模生产。罗伯特·富尔顿用克莱蒙特号制造和开发的蒸汽机降低了运输成本。马萨诸塞州洛厄尔的洛厄尔工厂系统由新英格兰农场女儿，后来是爱尔兰移民操作。所有这些都在改变北方的经济。你们有联邦诉亨特案，州最高法院裁定允许成立工会。由于这些机会和工厂制度，移民涌入美国——爱尔兰人、德国人、英国人以及所有其他移民群体——他们倾向于定居在北方或中西部的农业地区。你们看到了这些移民涌入。当然，随之而来的是本土主义团体的兴起，例如一无所知党，他们是反移民的，尤其是反对爱尔兰移民。

记住，尽管这两个地区正在发展独特的特征，但南方和北方的经济活动是相互关联的。南方棉花为东北部的制造业提供了原材料。

同样，在这一时期结束时，你们经历了第二次大觉醒——查尔斯·芬尼和宗教复兴运动，这种从内部进行精神改革的思想。这些觉醒运动席卷边疆地区，带来了大量的皈依和宗教复兴。但在此期间，你们也看到了各种社会改革运动。你们有禁酒运动——美国禁酒协会试图让人们停止饮酒。多萝西娅·迪克斯进行了监狱改革。你们有废奴运动——像弗雷德里克·道格拉斯、威廉·劳埃德·加里森、大卫·沃克以及许多其他人。你们有妇女权利运动——我们已经看到了塞内卡瀑布会议。在马萨诸塞州，霍勒斯·曼推动了北方教育改革。还有许多乌托邦社群——一些是宗教性的，例如摩门教徒和震颤派，另一些像布鲁克农场，他们试图创建这些理想主义的模范社区来改革社会。

Welcome back to another installment of the ultimate APUSH review. Today we are taking a look at APUSH period 4 which goes from 1800 to 1848, and today we got it reviewed for you.

So real quick, the Big Ideas really simplified: the role and relationship between the federal and state governments will continue to evolve during this time, so you're going to see this theme in today's presentation. Two, this era will experience rapid economic, territorial, and demographic changes -- the United States is going to be going through change in all three of those categories. Sectionalism will increase during this time -- it's always been an issue, it's going to continue to be an issue in period 4. The new Republic will both extend democratic rights and continue to struggle to define and extend democratic ideals to all Americans. Translation: some Americans are going to see the right to vote suddenly, and others are going to continue to be denied that. And then finally, various reform movements will seek to change American society.

So let's take a look. Kind of one of the important points you're going to see is America is expanding its territory. The size of the United States is going to more than double during this period. In fact, the US will attempt to increase our foreign trade, expand our borders, and at the same time -- especially after the War of 1812 -- attempt to isolate ourselves from foreign affairs. This will make way more sense in just a moment.

So let's take a look. If you look at a map of America in 1790, the population density was kind of hugging along the Atlantic Seaboard, and you see this change because by 1830 the population is moving west. You know, you still got these population centers like Boston and Philadelphia, but people are moving west with increasing frequency. And there's a lot of different reasons for it. One, the population's growing through natural population growth -- birth rate is allowing the population of the United States to increase. You also have this huge amount of immigration coming, especially around 1830 and especially 1840 -- the number of immigrants increase, and the people who are coming are different. The number one group is the Irish, number two is the Germans, and then number three are English immigrants as well as others.

Transportation improvements allow this western expansion to take place as well. You know, we have this Transportation Revolution with canal building, the First National Road -- the Cumberland Road -- and eventually of course the big one: railroads in the 1830s and 40s. So transportation improvements allow this western expansion. And then with Eli Whitney's cotton gin invented in the 1790s, cotton production is going to increase, and Southerners are looking for more and more land. And with the increase of cotton production, unfortunately goes the increase of slavery, and it's going to be moving west into places like Alabama and Mississippi and Missouri.

Other reasons for this western expansion are threats are removed from the continent. For instance, Napoleon was kind of hoping to create a French Empire once again on the North American continent, but that all goes -- you know, disappears -- because in 1803 Jefferson gets Louisiana Purchase, doubling the size of the US without having to go to war. Remember in the War of 1812, once again England and US round two -- we fight and we are able to fight to a stalemate. We don't defeat England, but we stand up to them again, and we get those British forts that had been kind of hanging out since the Treaty of Paris after the American Revolution -- we get rid of those once and for all. And then in 1819, we reach a deal with Spain -- the Adams-Onís Treaty -- where Spain agrees to sell us Florida. So we're able to move west, our boundaries are expanding. And of course, the sad reality: this is going to take place as a result of many Native American defeats, and we'll take a look at that in just a moment. In fact, right now.

So if you look at a map, this is kind of roughly land loss by native people up until 1783, and that same land by around 1850 -- it's a rapid decline in the amount of native land. And there's a whole bunch of events, and we'll kind of briefly highlight a few of the key ones for APUSH period 4. One, the Battle of Tippecanoe -- Tecumseh is defeated by William Henry Harrison just before the War of 1812. You have the First Seminole War which takes place in 1817-1818 where the natives once again are defeated. And tragic events surrounding the Indian Removal Act -- the ignoring of the Supreme Court by Andrew Jackson -- and of course finally the Trail of Tears where the so-called Five Civilized Tribes will be removed from the territory.

Now, couple of kind of things to keep in mind. Remember in this period you also have this struggle for neutrality. Even before 1800, Washington and Adams had been trying to stay neutral from the war -- the Napoleonic Wars. And we had the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair in 1807 where England attacks our ship the Chesapeake. We have the Embargo which is a big epic failure -- you can't trade with anybody -- and it's replaced by the Non-Intercourse Act in 1809, and eventually Macon's Bill Number Two, which all of those are unable to really preserve American neutrality, which leads eventually to the War of 1812.

And there's a lot of reasons why we have the War of 1812. You know, we want to defend our neutrality from impressment, we want to defend our national honor. There's also those continued forts on US soil. Tecumseh and his brother are being supplied by the British with guns which are then being used against Americans on the frontier. And of course some of those War Hawks like Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun are talking about why don't we expand our territory and take Canada. And eventually we have the War of 1812 under James Madison which leads eventually to the Treaty of Ghent, and all is settled once again between us and our former mother country.

Key concept in the APUSH standards: the US will seek to expand its global presence by focusing its expansion on the North American continent and continuing to promote foreign trade. So kind of some highlights for this is of course the Louisiana Purchase -- I already mentioned. Jefferson goes to war rather than pay tribute to the Barbary Pirates -- he goes to war, uses the Navy which he criticized under Adams to fight the Barbary Pirates. The War of 1812 preserves our neutrality. The Rush-Bagot Treaty of 1817 -- Secretary of State John Quincy Adams helps negotiate an agreement where England and the US agreed to disarm the Great Lakes region, possibly preventing a war. The British-American Convention in 1818 is a joint agreement between the US and England where we agree we will jointly occupy Oregon for 10 years, the northern boundary of the Louisiana Territory will be set at the 49th parallel, and we'll agree to go on some nice fishing trips in the Newfoundland region -- we'll share that section for fishing. Adams-Onís Treaty will buy Florida from Spain. Monroe Doctrine of 1823 -- we basically tell Europe: stay the heck out of the Western Hemisphere, no more colonies, we won't intervene in your affairs, you stay the heck out of ours. No way we could enforce it, but England was down with it, so they never really test the Monroe Doctrine. The Lone Star Republic is established in 1836 -- Texans kind of declared their independence from Mexico, causes all sorts of controversy. No one wants to annex Texas because of the whole issue of slavery, so Texas will be its own country for a brief period. Things will be covered in period five but actually fall in the framework of period 4: the election of Polk, Manifest Destiny, Oregon, Texas, and of course the biggie -- the Mexican-American War, but we'll cover that next time.

Kind of one of the key ideas happening during this time period as well is rise of nationalism. And really you see cultural nationalism where patriotic themes can be seen in art, literature, and other forms. So you have the Hudson River School where people are painting these landscape paintings of the Hudson River Valley celebrating the natural beauty of the North American continent. You have men like John James Audubon studying the birds of North America. So you have all this kind of cultural nationalism.

After the War of 1812, economic nationalism can best be seen in the American System by Henry Clay where he talks about the need for the Second Bank of the United States -- it's reestablished, rechartered in 1816. You have the protective tariff where the tariff's goal was to protect American industry and also help fund transportation improvements, which is the third part of the American system. So this idea of developing the economy of the United States.

Political nationalism we can also see -- there's only one political party after the war, it is the Democratic-Republican party. The Federalists were already kind of fading away -- the Hartford Convention hurts them -- and you have one political party, and we get this called the Era of Good Feelings. And they do adopt some Federalist ideas -- even before this time period the Republicans were adopting some Federalist ideas -- but they're still will be disputes over things like the tariff and slavery, the bank, so it's not exactly all good feelings politics between these 1800 to 1848.

Of course you have the election of 1800 -- the first peaceful transition of power with the election of Jefferson. The Era of Good Feelings -- kind of the election of Monroe is kind of seen as the start, and it kind of starts to fall apart after the Panic of 1819. One political party -- Federalists are gone. Of course not all good feelings because there are factions within the Republican party -- they have disagreements over issues like slavery and tariffs. And all of it will kind of just crumble with the election of 1824 and the so-called corrupt bargain when John Quincy Adams becomes president following a disputed election, and suddenly Henry Clay becomes Secretary of State. And you have this period of political tension all throughout this period.

Historians have kind of pointed it out as the Age of the Common Man as new state laws are passed which allow for more white men to vote, and so property requirements are done away with. And so you have this huge increase in the number of people participating in the electoral process. And of course in 1828, you get the election of Andrew Jackson in a rematch against John Quincy Adams. And during Jackson's presidency, you have the rise of the second two-party system where under Andrew Jackson -- the Democrats versus the Whigs -- and the Whigs are going to be the opponents of Andrew Jackson.

As you can see on this map, kind of reviewing really quickly the political kind of developments during this time period: the Revolution of 1800 -- the election of Jefferson; Hartford Convention -- the moment the Federalists kind of put the final nail into their coffin; followed by the Era of Good Feelings -- one political party, they are all Republicans (of course that's not exactly completely true, it is a simplified version); then the corrupt bargain; and then eventually you get the Democratic party which are similar to the old school Democratic-Republicans, and the Whig party which have a lot of similarities to the Federalists in terms of their beliefs.

Denied: there are going to be people who are denied or left out of this new national culture. In fact, women are going to see their roles restricted. There's this idea of the cult of domesticity -- a woman's place was in the domestic sphere. Of course as the nation became a republic, there was this idea of Republican Motherhood where women should raise good citizens to be active in the democratic process, especially their young sons. And a big historic event takes place in 1848 when you have at Seneca Falls the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments where women outline their grievances towards the country and demand full equal rights.

For African Americans, we're going to take a look at them a little bit more closely in a moment, but you're going to see the rise of the pro-slavery arguments, racism in both the North and the South, and the complete exclusion of African-Americans from this national culture. And Native people -- once again, native resistance will be met by force removal by the government of the United States.

Big idea in this period as we move west: it's essential you understand the rise of sectionalism. In spite of this increase in nationalism, sectionalism will continue to plague the nation. You're going to have the Northeast, the North, the West, and the South, and they're going to all pursue their own kind of agendas. In fact, state governments at this time will also resist the authority of the federal government, and you could see that in two great examples: the North at the Hartford Convention in 1814 -- New England Federalists are going to consider possible secession due to their anger and resentment about the War of 1812. However, the war was over by the time their plot comes to the surface, and the Federalists fade away. Kind of more significant is what happens in the South with the nullification crisis in 1828 to 1832 -- South Carolina votes to nullify the Tariff of 1828 and 1832, creating a serious problem. And Jackson as the president sends federal troops, and eventually you get the Compromise Tariff of 1833, also known as the olive branch and the sword. So state governments are going to be resisting the federal government at times, and once again that idea of sectionalism -- so important in spite of this increase in nationalism, sectionalism will continue to plague the nation.

We've seen some of these examples, but quick review: the Second Bank of the United States -- supported by the North, opposed by the South. Internal transportation improvements -- heavily favored by the West, but states' rights supporters oppose the spending of federal money on internal improvements. Protective Tariff of 1816 is going to be supported by Northern manufacturers, resisted by Southerners. Very often, the Missouri issue is going to be a hugely complicated sectional crisis because it's going to divide the North and the South -- should slavery expand into new states? And it's temporarily going to be solved by the Missouri Compromise where they make Missouri a slave state, Maine a free state, and they cut off slavery north of 36°30'. The nullification issue we've already mentioned where South Carolina is going to resist the Tariff of 1828, and other Southern states are going to kind of morally support South Carolina. And Andrew Jackson of course is going to respond with the olive branch and the sword. And then of course a big problem is going to happen with the National Bank debate where Jackson is going to veto the rechartering of the bank, and you're going to have the rise of pet banks. This is going to be an issue that's going to also to some degree divide Northerners and Southerners.

In spite of the sectionalism though, you see this commitment to the union. In fact, when Daniel Webster and Robert Hayne debate in 1830, it is Daniel Webster who rejects the idea that a state could defy or leave the union. Andrew Jackson also rejects that when he puts the smackdown on South Carolina during the Nullification Crisis in 1832. So there is this commitment to the union, but there is sectional tension.

In spite of this kind of effort by states and different sections of the country to kind of pursue their goals, the Supreme Court will increase the power of the federal government during this time. We saw it -- John Marshall, kind of the Federalist judge. Marbury v. Madison -- the importance of judicial review -- they established that precedent. McCulloch v. Maryland -- the court rules the Second Bank of the US is constitutional, therefore saying the federal government can create the bank. And another case -- Gibbons v. Ogden -- states do not regulate interstate commerce, trade between states -- the federal government does. So all of these different cases during John Marshall's tenure as the Chief Justice are going to further the power of the federal government.

Regional sectional identity of the South -- a couple things you should keep in mind: the cotton gin is invented in 1793 -- it's going to transform cotton production. Slave ownership was a sign of status, and in the South you have the kind of rise of this aristocratic plantation class. Those people had the wealth. The majority of Southerners did not own slaves yet supported the institution of slavery -- only about 25% of Southerners actually owned any slaves at all. But there was this hope of one day they themselves would own slaves as well. They have this code of chivalry in the South -- this strong sense of honor among Southerners. And as Northerners became critical of slavery and slave revolts were taking place, Southerners became very defensive of the institution of slavery. In fact, you see George Fitzhugh defending slavery as a positive good -- it was better than the factory labor in the North. And in some instances, you see the use of religion to defend slavery.

Amongst African-Americans, the experiences were mixed depending upon where they were, but life under slavery sucked no matter who you were. Slaves relied on extended or surrogate families to kind of maintain emotional bonds with one another to resist the inhumanity of slavery. During the Second Great Awakening, there's the importance of the slave spiritual -- slave music and religion. Many slaves during the first and second Great Awakening take on Christianity like becoming Methodists, and the importance of fusing African religions with Christianity, and you get these kind of hybrid faiths. Slave resistance plays a key role -- you're going to have all sorts of different ways that slaves are going to show their unhappiness with the institution: sabotage, destroying things, destroying tools, running away, work slowdowns, and the most obvious one is going to be rebellions. And Denmark Vesey is an example in 1822 in Virginia -- his rebellion is going to be betrayed, and he is, along with his supporters, going to be killed before the rebellion can take place. Nat Turner is going to have some luck in 1831 -- he is going to rebel. Unfortunately for Nat Turner and his followers, after the rebellion takes place, eventually they are captured and killed as well. And these rebellions and the threat of rebellions leave Southern states to pass stricter slave codes.

There is going to be a growing abolitionist movement in the North. There is going to be a free black population in the North and the South with severe restrictions on them in both places. And you're going to get individuals like David Walker -- his famous Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World in 1829, basically talking about the importance of fighting back against the inhumanity of slavery. Other abolitionist movements: the American Colonization Society -- their whole plan was to eventually slowly free slaves and send freed slaves to Africa. You also get individuals like William Lloyd Garrison -- the American Anti-Slavery Society he creates, calling for immediate uncompensated emancipation in his famous newspaper The Liberator. And a lot of other individuals such as Frederick Douglass and so on.

There's also going to be a unique regional identity of the North. While the South is relying on Southern agriculture and especially slave labor, you're going to see the rise of manufacturing in the North. Samuel Slater known as the father of the factory system, the growth of cities. Eli Whitney's interchangeable parts allows for mass production in factories. The steam engine -- produced, developed by Robert Fulton with the Clermont -- allows for transportation costs to be cheaper. The Lowell factory system in Lowell, Massachusetts worked by New England farm daughters, later Irish immigrants. All of this is kind of changing the economy of the North. You have the court case Commonwealth v. Hunt where the state supreme court rules that labor unions are allowed. And as a result of these opportunities and the factory system, immigrants are coming into the US -- the Irish, the Germans, the English, and every other group that was coming -- and they tended to settle in the North or in the Midwest farm regions. And you get these immigrants coming in. And of course with that, you see the rise of nativist groups such as the Know-Nothing Party who is anti-immigrant, especially Irish immigrant.

Keep in mind although these two regions are developing unique characteristics, the economic activities of the South and North were linked together. Southern cotton provided the raw material for manufacturing in the Northeast.

And also closing out in this period of time, you have the Second Great Awakening take place -- Charles Finney and the religious revivalism, this idea of spiritual reform from within. And these awakenings are sweeping the frontier, and huge number of conversions and religious revivalism. But also during this time period, you have various social reform movements. You have the temperance movement -- the American Temperance Society trying to get people to stop drinking. You have prison reform by Dorothea Dix. You have the abolitionist movement -- people like Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, David Walker, and many many others. You have women's rights movement -- Seneca Falls we've seen. Education in the North in Massachusetts with Horace Mann. And a whole bunch of utopian societies -- some religious such as the Mormons and the Shakers, others like Brook Farm where they're trying to create these model idealistic communities to reform society.

All right everybody, that's going to do it today. Passing APUSH is hard work -- hopefully this video on period 4 made it just a little bit easier.
