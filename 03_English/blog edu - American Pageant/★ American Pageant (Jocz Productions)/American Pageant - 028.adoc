== 释义


Welcome to Joe Productions. + 
 Today we're going to take a look at the second part of the Progressive Movement 进步运动 and we're going to examine Woodrow Wilson's foreign policy 伍德罗·威尔逊的外交政策. + 
 This video is going to help you with any APUSH textbook you're using -- but that's how it lines up to 与……相符 some of the popular ones. + 


Keep in mind when we last left off 上次讲到 the Republican party 共和党 was divided 分裂, and it's really during Taft's presidency 塔夫脱总统任期 that the Republican Party divides. + 
 And it's really between the supporters of Theodore Roosevelt 西奥多·罗斯福 and William Howard Taft 威廉·霍华德·塔夫脱. + 
 And there's a couple of events that take place to cause this division 导致分裂. + 
 One -- Taft supports the Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909 1909年佩恩 - 奥尔德里奇关税法 which raised the rates of the tariff 提高关税税率, and really progressives within the Republican party don't want this to occur -- they wanted to see the tariff decrease if anything. + 


A bigger event actually takes place with the Pinchot-Ballinger controversy 平肖 - 巴林杰争端 when Taft fires 解雇 Roosevelt's homie 好友 -- the chief of the forest service 林务局局长 Gifford Pinchot 吉福德·平肖. + 
 Remember he was one of the big conservationists 自然资源保护主义者, and he's fired because he criticizes the Secretary of the Interior 内政部长 Ballinger who Taft supports. + 
 And the reason why Pinchot criticizes him is because Ballinger opened up public lands in Alaska to private development 开放阿拉斯加的公有土地用于私人开发. + 
 And for conservationists this seems like the administration had sold out on the issue of conservation 在自然资源保护问题上背叛了立场. + 


So in 1912 there's a big old debate in the Republican Party. + 
 Taft wins the Republican nomination 共和党提名, and you can see it was split in half 一分为二. + 
 Roosevelt's not going to back down 退缩 though -- he forms his own political party known as the Progressive Party 进步党 or more commonly referred to by its nickname The Bull Moose Party 公鹿党. + 
 And really he runs on a program called New Nationalism 新国家主义 in which he wants an active federal government 积极作为的联邦政府 pursuing a wide variety of reforms 推行各种改革. + 
 And he's going to throw his support behind 支持 every major progressive issue from women's suffrage 妇女选举权 to breaking up bad monopolies 瓦解不良垄断企业. + 


The Democrats 民主党 pick a guy by the name of Woodrow Wilson 伍德罗·威尔逊 who had a reputation for cleaning up politics 整顿政治 in New Jersey 新泽西州. + 
 He runs on a progressive platform 进步主义纲领 of New Freedom 新自由 -- once again also calling for reforms but especially tariff reform 关税改革, bank reform 银行改革 and anti-trust laws 反垄断法. + 
 The Socialist Party 社会党 runs a candidate Eugene Debs 尤金·德布斯 -- remember the guy during the Pullman Strike 普尔曼罢工. + 
 And the reason the Socialist Party is really important in this election is it demonstrates the growing frustration over the slow pace of reforms 改革步伐缓慢引发的日益不满. + 
 Many people wanted more change in American society, and the Socialists were the most radical proponents 激进的支持者 because they called for more radical reforms than most progressive candidates -- including public ownership of the major industries 主要产业公有制 such as the railroads, steel, oil. + 


Well when you have two Republicans against one another it pretty much guarantees that the donkeys 民主党（其象征为驴） -- the Democrats -- are going to win because in 1912 Woodrow Wilson wins the presidency 总统职位. + 
 And really under Wilson Progressive Era reforms 进步时代改革 are going to continue, but he wants to assault what was referred to as the triple wall of privilege 特权的三重壁垒 -- tariffs 关税, trusts 托拉斯, and banks 银行. + 
 And so you're going to see that take place under the presidency of Wilson. + 


Tariff reform 关税改革 -- the Underwood Tariff 安德伍德关税法 is passed in 1913 which lowered the rates of tariffs 降低关税税率. + 
 It's the first major tariff reduction 关税削减 in 50 years -- so this is a big win for those people who did not like high tariffs like farmers for instance 比如农民. + 
 When it came to trusts 托拉斯 -- couple of reforms you should know about. + 
 The Federal Trade Commission 联邦贸易委员会 in 1914 which basically allows presidential appointed commission 总统任命的委员会 would investigate monopolies 调查垄断企业. + 
 An important thing to keep in mind is that it exempted labor unions from being prosecuted 豁免工会被起诉. + 
 And of course the Clayton Antitrust Act 克莱顿反垄断法 is passed in 1914 which increases the power of the Sherman Antitrust Act 谢尔曼反托拉斯法 -- so more regulation federal regulation of monopolies 加强联邦对垄断企业的监管. + 


Banking reform 银行改革 is probably Wilson's most notable domestic achievement 国内成就 under the Federal Reserve Act 联邦储备法. + 
 And the reason why the Federal Reserve Act is passed is there's this belief that the gold standard 金本位制 was too inflexible 缺乏灵活性. + 
 And what this would do is the Federal Reserve 联邦储备系统 -- the Fed -- would be responsible for regulating the money supply 调控货币供应量. + 
 And there was this feeling that previous economic panics 经济恐慌 such as the Panic of 1901 1901年经济恐慌 demonstrated the problem of a limited money supply 货币供应量有限的问题. + 
 So there was a desire to have the Federal Reserve be able to supervise the whole thing 监督整个过程 -- issue Federal Reserve notes 发行联邦储备券 -- printing paper money 印制纸币 -- so that the money supply could be increased or decreased as needed 按需增减货币供应量. + 
 And this is a huge change in banking along with the 16th Amendment 第十六条修正案 which allows for the income tax 所得税 to be established 确立. + 
 And recall the Populist Party 民粹党 wanted this income tax to be put into place 实施. + 


So these are Wilson's big achievements. + 
 So there you see Wilson kind of washing up the trust 整治托拉斯 with the Sherman Antitrust Act and other laws. + 
 But there's also smaller ones you should be aware of. + 
 The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 1916年联邦农业贷款法 allowed for low rate loans 低息贷款 to farmers -- so farmers are getting a little bit of help. + 
 And the Child Labor Act 童工法 which prohibited state commerce of products made by children 禁止童工生产的产品进行州际贸易. + 


Now an area you should really make sure you know about is the failure of the Progressive Movement when it came to African-American civil rights 非裔美国人的民权问题. + 
 And this goes beyond Woodrow Wilson because most progressive reformers were not interested in advancing the cause of social justice 推动社会正义事业 or extending democracy to African Americans 向非裔美国人扩展民主. + 
 In fact African-Americans were often times largely ignored by Progressive Era politicians from Roosevelt on -- not much in the way of civil rights advances 民权进展. + 
 In fact as a whole there are going to be very little protests to the rise of lynching 私刑 in the 1890s or the existence of Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法. + 
 Remember Plessy v. + 
 Ferguson 普莱西诉弗格森案 happens in 1896. + 


And so an important thing to keep in mind -- since African-Americans lack mass support from the progressives 缺乏进步人士的广泛支持 they're going to advocate for themselves 为自己发声. + 
 And there's a couple of different people that you need to be aware about. + 
 We've already met Booker T. + 
 -- but a quick review never hurt anybody. + 
 Remember in 1895 Washington gives his Atlanta Exposition speech 亚特兰大博览会演讲 in which he outlines his vision 阐述他的愿景. + 
 And really that vision was African-Americans should acquire vocational skills 职业技能 to gain self-respect 自尊 and economic security 经济保障. + 
 To achieve this goal he establishes Tuskegee Institute 塔斯基吉学院, and he is not going to be an advocate for directly challenging white supremacy 白人至上主义. + 
 He felt that economic independence 经济独立 would eventually lead to political and social independence 政治和社会独立. + 
 And some of his critics -- such as the guy we're going to meet in just a second -- accuse him of being an accommodationist 妥协者. + 


The other big figure in the civil rights movement 民权运动 is W.
E.
B.
 Du Bois 杜波依斯. + 
 He writes his very influential The Souls of Black Folk 《黑人的灵魂》. + 
 He rejects Booker's gradualism 渐进主义 and he demanded immediate political and social equality 立即实现政治和社会平等 for African-American people. + 
 He's a figure in the Niagara Movement 尼亚加拉运动 where a group of civil rights leaders meet at Niagara Falls 尼亚加拉大瀑布, and they kind of eventually turned this movement into something called the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 全国有色人种协进会 in 1909 -- the NAACP. + 


Ida B.  Wells 艾达·B·韦尔斯 is a very important figure you should also know about. +
 She is going to be a very vocal advocate 直言不讳的倡导者 against lynching 私刑 and also women suffrage 妇女选举权 and in general just civil rights 民权 as a member of the NAACP and other organizations. + 


Another key thing you should keep in mind is the role of women. + 
 And although women were playing a more active role in the Progressive Era 进步时代 they are not always supported by Progressive Era reformers 进步时代的改革者. + 
 One example is the issue of suffrage 选举权. + 
 Woodrow Wilson is not going to be an advocate for an amendment granting women the right to vote 支持赋予妇女选举权的修正案. + 
 And women were advocating on their own 自行争取权利. + 
 In fact the National American Woman Suffrage Association 美国全国妇女选举权协会 -- NAWSA -- was headed by Carrie Chapman Catt  Carrie Chapman Catt：卡丽·查普曼·卡特. + 
 She becomes the president during this period, and she favored fighting for suffrage -- the right to vote -- with a state-by-state strategy 逐个州争取选举权的策略 -- basically win the right to vote in individual states and eventually you would have enough that national politicians such as Wilson would support giving it to women in the entire country. + 


This was not supported by all members of NAWSA. + 
 And one important figure that you definitely need to know about is Alice Paul 爱丽丝·保罗. + 
 She breaks away from NAWSA 脱离美国全国妇女选举权协会 and forms the National Women's Party 全国妇女党 in 1916. + 
 They are much more militant 激进的 -- they're going to protest in front of the White House 在白宫前抗议 before and during World War I. + 
 And their big goal is a national amendment granting women the right to vote 全国性的赋予妇女选举权的修正案. + 
 And eventually this will take place with the 19th Amendment 第十九条修正案. + 
 Wilson -- like I said -- will not initially support this but eventually it will pass. + 


So wrapping up 总结 the kind of progressive movement -- keep in mind all of these presidents are all going to seek reform at the national level 寻求全国层面的改革, and there's going to be varying degrees of success and failure 不同程度的成功与失败. + 
 Another important topic is Wilson's foreign policy 外交政策. + 
 And remember the US was increasingly pursuing an aggressive foreign policy 积极的外交政策 in places such as Asia, Latin America. + 
 We saw McKinley with the Open Door Policy 麦金利的门户开放政策, Roosevelt with his Big Stick Policy 罗斯福的大棒政策, Taft with Dollar Diplomacy 塔夫脱的金元外交. + 
 Wilson's going to shift direction 转变方向 with a policy called Moral Diplomacy 道德外交. + 
 And part of what moral diplomacy was -- and you could see this in the political cartoon 政治漫画 -- is that Wilson wanted to promote democracy to other countries 向其他国家推广民主. + 
 He also wanted to pursue less imperialistic policies 推行较少帝国主义色彩的政策. + 
 You're going to see an improvement of relations 关系改善 between the United States and countries such as the Philippines 菲律宾 and Panama 巴拿马. + 


However Wilson isn't going to be immune from wanting to intervene in other countries' affairs 干预其他国家事务. + 
 And the best example is what Wilson does in Mexico 墨西哥. + 
 Little context for you -- Mexico had a revolution 革命 -- the Mexican Revolution 墨西哥革命 -- and it removes the dictator Porfirio Díaz 独裁者波菲里奥·迪亚斯 from power. + 
 And the US cares about Mexico because we had a lot of investments in Mexico 在美国有大量投资, and revolutions typically are not very good for business 不利于商业. + 
 There's rotating leadership 领导层更迭 in Mexico -- various people are trying to kind of assume power 掌权 and there's a power struggle 权力斗争 that takes place. + 
 And eventually there's a guy by the name of Huerta 韦尔塔 who becomes the leader of Mexico, and he was kind of a military dictator 军事独裁者. + 
 And Wilson does not like him -- he refuses to recognize his government 拒绝承认他的政府 -- he calls it a government of butchers 屠夫政府. + 


And one of the things Wilson does is he orders an arms embargo 武器禁运 -- keeping weapons from getting to the Huerta government 阻止武器流入韦尔塔政府. + 
 And he starts giving aid to revolutionaries fighting Huerta 向反抗韦尔塔的革命者提供援助 -- some of those by the name of Carranza 卡兰萨 and Pancho Villa 潘乔·比利亚. + 
 Well things get a little heated 事态升温 because American soldiers are arrested by Mexican officials at Tampico 坦皮科 -- it's known as the Tampico Incident 坦皮科事件 -- those are the guys who were arrested. + 
 And there's this period where Mexico is not apologizing in the manner that we would like 未按美国期望的方式道歉, and US naval forces 美国海军 occupy the Mexican port of Veracruz 占领墨西哥韦拉克鲁斯港. + 


Frustrated with US involvement in his country 对美国干涉感到不满 -- a guy you see in the middle right there Pancho Villa 潘乔·比利亚 -- leads a series of raids 袭击 across the border 越境 killing American citizens in Texas 得克萨斯州 and New Mexico 新墨西哥州. + 
 And in 1916 Woodrow Wilson sends in General John J. + 
 Pershing 约翰·J·潘兴将军 and the expeditionary forces 远征军 into Mexico to apprehend Pancho Villa 逮捕潘乔·比利亚. + 
 They're unable to arrest him 未能将其逮捕, and the countries are very close to war 两国濒临战争边缘. + 
 And the only thing that really kind of stops it from possibly occurring is the growing threat of war in Europe 欧洲日益增长的战争威胁 causes Wilson to remove the troops 撤军. + 


And that leads us to the big thing -- the Great War 大战 -- World War I 第一次世界大战. + 
 We're not going to talk about the causes -- there's a variety of factors that contributed to the outbreak of World War I 导致第一次世界大战爆发 -- you know most people think of them as MAIN -- militarism 军国主义, alliances 联盟, imperialism 帝国主义 and nationalism 民族主义. + 
 Of course the immediate cause 直接原因 is the assassination of Franz Ferdinand 弗朗茨·斐迪南大公遇刺 in June of 1914. + 
 World War I begins. + 
 It's important you keep in mind our reaction to the war is we advocate a policy of neutrality 中立政策. + 
 Even more important is that you understand that US neutrality was very difficult to maintain 维持中立非常困难. + 
 The struggle is real. + 


Couple of things -- the United States was never completely neutral during World War I 第一次世界大战期间从未完全中立. + 
 What the heck does that mean? From the start we had a stronger connection to England than Germany 与德国相比, 与英国联系更紧密. + 
 We shared a language 语言相同. + 
 We have legal and political institutions 法律和政治制度相似. + 
 They used to be our mama 曾是我们的宗主国. + 
 In fact American public opinion 美国公众舆论 was largely anti-German 反德的 even though there's a lot of German immigrants in America at this time -- largely anti-German for a variety of reasons. + 
 One -- the autocratic government of the Kaiser 德皇的专制政府 -- they don't have a democratic system 没有民主制度. + 
 The fact that they invaded Belgium 入侵比利时. + 
 Propaganda 宣传 especially from England -- like the poster you see right there. + 
 And of course that history with the Allies 协约国 -- France and England -- namely draws us much more to the Allied cause 使我们更倾向于协约国一方. + 


Another reason is American manufacturers, bankers and investors heavily sided with the Allied cause 美国制造商、银行家和投资者大力支持协约国. + 
 Both England and France greatly benefited from trade and loans from the United States 从美国的贸易和贷款中获益. + 
 And so we are giving a lot of money to the Allies 向协约国提供大量资金. + 
 And England used its superior navy 强大的海军 to blockade any trade from the United States or any country from entering Germany 封锁任何美国或其他国家与德国的贸易. + 
 So you see from the start US is financially invested in the Allied cause 美国在经济上支持协约国一方. + 


What starts happening is Germany decides to resort to 采取 unrestricted submarine warfare 无限制潜艇战 using U-boats 潜艇 -- submarines -- and they start sinking a series of ships 击沉一系列船只. + 
 Some of the notable ones is the Lusitania 卢西塔尼亚号 -- a British passenger ship 英国客轮. + 
 It sunk in May of 1915 off the coast of Ireland 爱尔兰海岸 killing almost 1,000 people including 128 Americans 导致近1000人死亡, 其中包括128名美国人. + 
 Germany does apologize and pledges not to sink any more neutral ships 承诺不再击沉中立国船只. + 
 Things calm down for a moment but then Germany sinks other ships including that one you see right there in March of 1916. + 
 Wilson once again threatens to cut off diplomatic relations with Germany 断绝与德国的外交关系, and the US and Germany are very close to war 濒临战争边缘. + 
 You could see Uncle Sam 山姆大叔（美国的象征） is frustrated in the political cartoon demanding that Germany stops. + 
 And Germany does issue the pledge where Germany promises we won't sink any more ships without warning those aboard 承诺不会在未警告船上人员的情况下击沉船只. + 


The big issue in the election of 1916 when Wilson's running for re-election 竞选连任 is the fact that he kept us out of the war 让美国置身战争之外. + 
 He reminds voters that he was the one who kept us out of war, and he easily wins re-election 轻松赢得连任. + 


However the following year the US will find itself in World War I -- but we'll cover that another day another time. +

欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们要探讨进步运动的第二部分，并且考察伍德罗·威尔逊的外交政策。这段视频将帮助你理解你正在使用的任何APUSH教材——但它与一些流行的教材的对应关系就是这样。

记住我们上次讲到共和党分裂了，共和党的分裂实际上发生在塔夫脱总统任期内。分裂主要发生在西奥多·罗斯福和威廉·霍华德·塔夫脱的支持者之间。导致这种分裂发生了几件事。其一，塔夫脱支持1909年的《佩恩-奥尔德里奇关税法案》，该法案提高了关税率，而共和党内的进步人士实际上不希望这种情况发生——他们希望看到关税降低，如果可以的话。

实际上，更大的事件发生在平肖-巴林杰争议中，当时塔夫脱解雇了罗斯福的朋友——森林服务局局长吉福德·平肖。记住他是重要的自然资源保护主义者之一，他被解雇是因为他批评了塔夫脱支持的内政部长巴林杰。平肖批评巴林杰的原因是巴林杰开放了阿拉斯加的公共土地用于私人开发。对于自然资源保护主义者来说，这似乎表明政府在自然资源保护问题上妥协了。

因此，在1912年，共和党内部展开了一场激烈的辩论。塔夫脱赢得了共和党总统候选人提名，你们可以看到共和党分裂成了两半。然而，罗斯福并没有退缩——他组建了自己的政党，称为进步党，更通俗的称呼是公牛驼鹿党。实际上，他以“新民族主义”为纲领竞选，主张积极的联邦政府推行广泛的改革。他将支持从妇女选举权到解散不良垄断企业等所有主要的进步议题。

民主党推选了一位名叫伍德罗·威尔逊的人，他在新泽西州以整顿政治而闻名。他以“新自由”的进步纲领竞选——再次呼吁改革，但尤其强调关税改革、银行改革和反托拉斯法。社会党推选了尤金·德布斯为候选人——记住普尔曼罢工期间的那个人。社会党在这次选举中非常重要的原因是，它表明了人们对改革步伐缓慢日益增长的不满。许多人希望美国社会发生更多的变革，而社会主义者是最激进的主张者，因为他们呼吁比大多数进步候选人更激进的改革——包括铁路、钢铁、石油等主要行业的公有制。

当你们有两个共和党人相互竞争时，这几乎保证了驴子——民主党人——会获胜，因为在1912年，伍德罗·威尔逊赢得了总统职位。实际上，在威尔逊的领导下，进步时代的改革将继续进行，但他想要攻击所谓的“特权三重壁垒”——关税、托拉斯和银行。因此，你们将在威尔逊总统任期内看到这种情况发生。

关税改革——1913年通过了《安德伍德关税法》，该法案降低了关税率。这是50年来首次大幅降低关税——因此对于那些不喜欢高关税的人，例如农民来说，这是一个巨大的胜利。在托拉斯方面——你们应该了解几项改革。1914年成立了联邦贸易委员会，该委员会基本上允许总统任命的委员会调查垄断企业。需要记住的重要一点是，它豁免了工会免受起诉。当然，1914年通过了《克莱顿反托拉斯法》，该法案增强了《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》的效力——因此对垄断企业进行了更多的联邦监管。

银行改革可能是威尔逊在《联邦储备法案》下最引人注目的国内成就。通过《联邦储备法案》的原因在于，人们认为金本位制过于僵化。该法案的作用是，联邦储备系统——美联储——将负责监管货币供应。人们认为，此前发生的经济恐慌，如1901年的恐慌，表明了货币供应有限的问题。因此，人们希望美联储能够监管整个体系——发行联邦储备券——印刷纸币——以便根据需要增加或减少货币供应。这是银行业的一项巨大变革，伴随着允许征收所得税的第十六修正案的通过。回想一下，人民党希望实施这项所得税。

这些是威尔逊的重大成就。因此，你们看到威尔逊利用《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》和其他法律来打击托拉斯。但还有一些较小的成就你们也应该了解。1916年的《联邦农场贷款法》允许向农民提供低息贷款——因此农民获得了一些帮助。《童工法》禁止各州之间交易由儿童制造的产品。

现在，你们真正应该确保了解的一个领域是进步运动在非裔美国人民权方面的失败。这不仅仅是伍德罗·威尔逊的问题，因为大多数进步改革家对推进社会正义或将民主扩展到非裔美国人并不感兴趣。事实上，从罗斯福开始，非裔美国人经常被进步时代的政治家们在很大程度上忽视——在民权方面没有太大的进展。事实上，总的来说，对于1890年代私刑的兴起或吉姆·克劳法的存在，几乎没有抗议活动。记住，普莱西诉弗格森案发生在1896年。

因此，需要记住的重要一点是——由于非裔美国人缺乏进步人士的大力支持，他们将为自己争取权利。你们需要了解几位不同的人物。我们已经认识了布克·T·华盛顿——但快速回顾一下总没坏处。记住，1895年华盛顿发表了他的亚特兰大博览会演讲，他在其中概述了他的愿景。实际上，他的愿景是非裔美国人应该获得职业技能，以获得自尊和经济保障。为了实现这个目标，他建立了塔斯基吉学院，他不会主张直接挑战白人至上主义。他认为经济独立最终将导致政治和社会独立。他的一些批评者——比如我们马上要认识的那个人——指责他是一个迁就者。

民权运动中的另一位重要人物是W.E.B.杜波依斯。他写了他极具影响力的《黑人的灵魂》。他拒绝了布克的渐进主义，并要求非裔美国人民立即获得政治和社会平等。他是尼亚加拉运动中的一位重要人物，一群民权领袖在尼亚加拉瀑布会面，他们最终将这场运动发展成为1909年的全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）。

艾达·B·威尔斯也是一位你们应该了解的非常重要的人物。她将成为反对私刑、争取妇女选举权以及作为全国有色人种协进会和其他组织成员争取普遍民权的一位非常直言不讳的倡导者。

你们应该记住的另一个关键是妇女的作用。尽管妇女在进步时代发挥着越来越积极的作用，但她们并不总是得到进步时代改革家的支持。一个例子是选举权问题。伍德罗·威尔逊不会成为支持赋予妇女选举权的修正案的倡导者。妇女们自己也在积极争取。事实上，全国妇女选举权协会（NAWSA）由凯莉·查普曼·卡特领导。她在此期间担任主席，她倾向于采取逐州策略争取选举权——基本上在各个州赢得选举权，最终你们将拥有足够多的州支持，像威尔逊这样的全国政治家将支持在全国范围内赋予妇女选举权。

并非全国妇女选举权协会的所有成员都支持这一点。你们绝对需要了解的一位重要人物是爱丽丝·保罗。她脱离了全国妇女选举权协会，于1916年成立了全国妇女党。她们更加激进——她们将在第一次世界大战前后在白宫前抗议。她们的主要目标是一项赋予妇女选举权的全国性修正案。最终，这将通过第十九修正案实现。威尔逊——正如我所说——最初不会支持这一点，但最终它会通过。

总结一下进步运动——记住所有这些总统都将在国家层面寻求改革，并且会有不同程度的成功和失败。另一个重要的话题是威尔逊的外交政策。记住，美国在亚洲和拉丁美洲等地越来越奉行积极的外交政策。我们看到了麦金利的门户开放政策，罗斯福的大棒政策，塔夫脱的金元外交。威尔逊将通过一项称为“道德外交”的政策来转变方向。道德外交的部分内容——你们可以在政治漫画中看到——是威尔逊希望向其他国家推广民主。他还希望奉行不那么帝国主义的政策。你们将看到美国与菲律宾和巴拿马等国家的关系有所改善。

然而，威尔逊并不会免于想要干预其他国家事务的欲望。最好的例子是威尔逊在墨西哥所做的事情。给你们一点背景——墨西哥发生了一场革命——墨西哥革命——它推翻了独裁者波菲里奥·迪亚斯。美国关心墨西哥是因为我们在墨西哥有很多投资，而革命通常对商业不利。墨西哥的领导层不断更迭——各种各样的人试图掌握权力，并且发生了权力斗争。最终，一个名叫韦尔塔的人成为墨西哥的领导人，他有点像一个军事独裁者。威尔逊不喜欢他——他拒绝承认他的政府——他称之为屠夫政府。

威尔逊所做的一件事是，他下令实施武器禁运——阻止武器运往韦尔塔政府。他开始向反对韦尔塔的革命者提供援助——其中一些人名叫卡兰萨和潘乔·比利亚。情况变得有点紧张，因为美国士兵在坦皮科被墨西哥官员逮捕——这被称为坦皮科事件——那些是被逮捕的人。有一段时间，墨西哥没有以我们希望的方式道歉，美国海军占领了墨西哥港口韦拉克鲁斯。

由于对美国干涉他的国家感到沮丧——你们在右边中间看到的那个人潘乔·比利亚——领导了一系列越境袭击，杀害了德克萨斯州和新墨西哥州的美国公民。1916年，伍德罗·威尔逊派遣约翰·J·潘兴将军和远征军进入墨西哥逮捕潘乔·比利亚。他们未能逮捕他，两国非常接近战争边缘。唯一真正阻止战争可能发生的事情是欧洲战争威胁的日益增长，这导致威尔逊撤回了军队。

这就引出了一个大问题——大战——第一次世界大战。我们不讨论其原因——导致第一次世界大战爆发的因素有很多——你们大多数人会想到“MAIN”——军国主义（Militarism）、联盟体系（Alliances）、帝国主义（Imperialism）和民族主义（Nationalism）。当然，直接原因是1914年6月弗朗茨·斐迪南大公遇刺。第一次世界大战爆发了。重要的是你们要记住我们对战争的反应是我们主张中立政策。更重要的是你们要理解，美国的中立非常难以维持。斗争是真实的。

有几件事——美国在第一次世界大战期间从未完全中立。这是什么意思？从一开始，我们与英国的联系就比与德国的联系更紧密。我们有共同的语言。我们有法律和政治制度。他们曾经是我们的“妈妈”。事实上，尽管当时美国有很多德国移民，但美国公众舆论在很大程度上是反德的——出于各种原因。其一——德皇的专制政府——他们没有民主制度。他们入侵比利时的事实。尤其是来自英国的宣传——就像你们在那张海报上看到的那样。当然，我们与盟友——法国和英国——的历史渊源也使我们更加倾向于协约国的事业。

另一个原因是，美国制造商、银行家和投资者大力支持协约国的事业。英国和法国都极大地受益于美国的贸易和贷款。因此，我们向协约国提供了大量资金。英国利用其强大的海军封锁了美国或任何国家进入德国的贸易。因此，你们从一开始就看到美国在经济上投资于协约国的事业。

接下来发生的是，德国决定恢复无限制潜艇战，使用U型潜艇——潜艇——并开始击沉一系列船只。其中一些著名的有卢西塔尼亚号——一艘英国客轮。它于1915年5月在爱尔兰海岸附近沉没，造成近1000人死亡，其中包括128名美国人。德国道歉并承诺不再击沉任何中立国家的船只。局势暂时平静下来，但随后德国又击沉了其他船只，包括你们在1916年3月看到的那艘。威尔逊再次威胁要与德国断绝外交关系，美国和德国非常接近战争边缘。你们可以在政治漫画中看到山姆大叔很沮丧，要求德国停止。德国确实发布了承诺，保证不再在没有警告船上人员的情况下击沉任何船只。

1916年威尔逊竞选连任时，选举中的一个大问题是他让我们置身于战争之外。他提醒选民他是那个让我们置身于战争之外的人，他轻松地赢得了连任。然而，第二年，美国将卷入第一次世界大战——但我们将在另一天、另一个时间讨论这个问题。

Welcome to Joe Productions. Today we're going to take a look at the second part of the Progressive Movement and we're going to examine Woodrow Wilson's foreign policy. This video is going to help you with any APUSH textbook you're using -- but that's how it lines up to some of the popular ones.

Keep in mind when we last left off the Republican party was divided, and it's really during Taft's presidency that the Republican Party divides. And it's really between the supporters of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. And there's a couple of events that take place to cause this division. One -- Taft supports the Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909 which raised the rates of the tariff, and really progressives within the Republican party don't want this to occur -- they wanted to see the tariff decrease if anything.

A bigger event actually takes place with the Pinchot-Ballinger controversy when Taft fires Roosevelt's homie -- the chief of the forest service Gifford Pinchot. Remember he was one of the big conservationists, and he's fired because he criticizes the Secretary of the Interior Ballinger who Taft supports. And the reason why Pinchot criticizes him is because Ballinger opened up public lands in Alaska to private development. And for conservationists this seems like the administration had sold out on the issue of conservation.

So in 1912 there's a big old debate in the Republican Party. Taft wins the Republican nomination, and you can see it was split in half. Roosevelt's not going to back down though -- he forms his own political party known as the Progressive Party or more commonly referred to by its nickname The Bull Moose Party. And really he runs on a program called New Nationalism in which he wants an active federal government pursuing a wide variety of reforms. And he's going to throw his support behind every major progressive issue from women's suffrage to breaking up bad monopolies.

The Democrats pick a guy by the name of Woodrow Wilson who had a reputation for cleaning up politics in New Jersey. He runs on a progressive platform of New Freedom -- once again also calling for reforms but especially tariff reform, bank reform and anti-trust laws. The Socialist Party runs a candidate Eugene Debs -- remember the guy during the Pullman Strike. And the reason the Socialist Party is really important in this election is it demonstrates the growing frustration over the slow pace of reforms. Many people wanted more change in American society, and the Socialists were the most radical proponents because they called for more radical reforms than most progressive candidates -- including public ownership of the major industries such as the railroads, steel, oil.

Well when you have two Republicans against one another it pretty much guarantees that the donkeys -- the Democrats -- are going to win because in 1912 Woodrow Wilson wins the presidency. And really under Wilson Progressive Era reforms are going to continue, but he wants to assault what was referred to as the triple wall of privilege -- tariffs, trusts and banks. And so you're going to see that take place under the presidency of Wilson.

Tariff reform -- the Underwood Tariff is passed in 1913 which lowered the rates of tariffs. It's the first major tariff reduction in 50 years -- so this is a big win for those people who did not like high tariffs like farmers for instance. When it came to trusts -- couple of reforms you should know about. The Federal Trade Commission in 1914 which basically allows presidential appointed commission would investigate monopolies. An important thing to keep in mind is that it exempted labor unions from being prosecuted. And of course the Clayton Antitrust Act is passed in 1914 which increases the power of the Sherman Antitrust Act -- so more regulation federal regulation of monopolies.

Banking reform is probably Wilson's most notable domestic achievement under the Federal Reserve Act. And the reason why the Federal Reserve Act is passed is there's this belief that the gold standard was too inflexible. And what this would do is the Federal Reserve -- the Fed -- would be responsible for regulating the money supply. And there was this feeling that previous economic panics such as the Panic of 1901 demonstrated the problem of a limited money supply. So there was a desire to have the Federal Reserve be able to supervise the whole thing -- issue Federal Reserve notes -- printing paper money -- so that the money supply could be increased or decreased as needed. And this is a huge change in banking along with the 16th Amendment which allows for the income tax to be established. And recall the Populist Party wanted this income tax to be put into place.

So these are Wilson's big achievements. So there you see Wilson kind of washing up the trust with the Sherman Antitrust Act and other laws. But there's also smaller ones you should be aware of. The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 allowed for low rate loans to farmers -- so farmers are getting a little bit of help. And the Child Labor Act which prohibited state commerce of products made by children.

Now an area you should really make sure you know about is the failure of the Progressive Movement when it came to African-American civil rights. And this goes beyond Woodrow Wilson because most progressive reformers were not interested in advancing the cause of social justice or extending democracy to African Americans. In fact African-Americans were often times largely ignored by Progressive Era politicians from Roosevelt on -- not much in the way of civil rights advances. In fact as a whole there are going to be very little protests to the rise of lynching in the 1890s or the existence of Jim Crow laws. Remember Plessy v. Ferguson happens in 1896.

And so an important thing to keep in mind -- since African-Americans lack mass support from the progressives they're going to advocate for themselves. And there's a couple of different people that you need to be aware about. We've already met Booker T. -- but a quick review never hurt anybody. Remember in 1895 Washington gives his Atlanta Exposition speech in which he outlines his vision. And really that vision was African-Americans should acquire vocational skills to gain self-respect and economic security. To achieve this goal he establishes Tuskegee Institute, and he is not going to be an advocate for directly challenging white supremacy. He felt that economic independence would eventually lead to political and social independence. And some of his critics -- such as the guy we're going to meet in just a second -- accuse him of being an accommodationist.

The other big figure in the civil rights movement is W.E.B. Du Bois. He writes his very influential The Souls of Black Folk. He rejects Booker's gradualism and he demanded immediate political and social equality for African-American people. He's a figure in the Niagara Movement where a group of civil rights leaders meet at Niagara Falls, and they kind of eventually turned this movement into something called the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909 -- the NAACP.

Ida B. Wells is a very important figure you should also know about. She is going to be a very vocal advocate against lynching and also women suffrage and in general just civil rights as a member of the NAACP and other organizations.

Another key thing you should keep in mind is the role of women. And although women were playing a more active role in the Progressive Era they are not always supported by Progressive Era reformers. One example is the issue of suffrage. Woodrow Wilson is not going to be an advocate for an amendment granting women the right to vote. And women were advocating on their own. In fact the National American Woman Suffrage Association -- NAWSA -- was headed by Carrie Chapman Catt. She becomes the president during this period, and she favored fighting for suffrage -- the right to vote -- with a state-by-state strategy -- basically win the right to vote in individual states and eventually you would have enough that national politicians such as Wilson would support giving it to women in the entire country.

This was not supported by all members of NAWSA. And one important figure that you definitely need to know about is Alice Paul. She breaks away from NAWSA and forms the National Women's Party in 1916. They are much more militant -- they're going to protest in front of the White House before and during World War I. And their big goal is a national amendment granting women the right to vote. And eventually this will take place with the 19th Amendment. Wilson -- like I said -- will not initially support this but eventually it will pass.

So wrapping up the kind of progressive movement -- keep in mind all of these presidents are all going to seek reform at the national level, and there's going to be varying degrees of success and failure. Another important topic is Wilson's foreign policy. And remember the US was increasingly pursuing an aggressive foreign policy in places such as Asia, Latin America. We saw McKinley with the Open Door Policy, Roosevelt with his Big Stick Policy, Taft with Dollar Diplomacy. Wilson's going to shift direction with a policy called Moral Diplomacy. And part of what moral diplomacy was -- and you could see this in the political cartoon -- is that Wilson wanted to promote democracy to other countries. He also wanted to pursue less imperialistic policies. You're going to see an improvement of relations between the United States and countries such as the Philippines and Panama.

However Wilson isn't going to be immune from wanting to intervene in other countries' affairs. And the best example is what Wilson does in Mexico. Little context for you -- Mexico had a revolution -- the Mexican Revolution -- and it removes the dictator Porfirio Díaz from power. And the US cares about Mexico because we had a lot of investments in Mexico, and revolutions typically are not very good for business. There's rotating leadership in Mexico -- various people are trying to kind of assume power and there's a power struggle that takes place. And eventually there's a guy by the name of Huerta who becomes the leader of Mexico, and he was kind of a military dictator. And Wilson does not like him -- he refuses to recognize his government -- he calls it a government of butchers.

And one of the things Wilson does is he orders an arms embargo -- keeping weapons from getting to the Huerta government. And he starts giving aid to revolutionaries fighting Huerta -- some of those by the name of Carranza and Pancho Villa. Well things get a little heated because American soldiers are arrested by Mexican officials at Tampico -- it's known as the Tampico Incident -- those are the guys who were arrested. And there's this period where Mexico is not apologizing in the manner that we would like, and US naval forces occupy the Mexican port of Veracruz.

Frustrated with US involvement in his country -- a guy you see in the middle right there Pancho Villa -- leads a series of raids across the border killing American citizens in Texas and New Mexico. And in 1916 Woodrow Wilson sends in General John J. Pershing and the expeditionary forces into Mexico to apprehend Pancho Villa. They're unable to arrest him, and the countries are very close to war. And the only thing that really kind of stops it from possibly occurring is the growing threat of war in Europe causes Wilson to remove the troops.

And that leads us to the big thing -- the Great War -- World War I. We're not going to talk about the causes -- there's a variety of factors that contributed to the outbreak of World War I -- you know most people think of them as MAIN -- militarism, alliances, imperialism and nationalism. Of course the immediate cause is the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in June of 1914. World War I begins. It's important you keep in mind our reaction to the war is we advocate a policy of neutrality. Even more important is that you understand that US neutrality was very difficult to maintain. The struggle is real.

Couple of things -- the United States was never completely neutral during World War I. What the heck does that mean? From the start we had a stronger connection to England than Germany. We shared a language. We have legal and political institutions. They used to be our mama. In fact American public opinion was largely anti-German even though there's a lot of German immigrants in America at this time -- largely anti-German for a variety of reasons. One -- the autocratic government of the Kaiser -- they don't have a democratic system. The fact that they invaded Belgium. Propaganda especially from England -- like the poster you see right there. And of course that history with the Allies -- France and England -- namely draws us much more to the Allied cause.

Another reason is American manufacturers, bankers and investors heavily sided with the Allied cause. Both England and France greatly benefited from trade and loans from the United States. And so we are giving a lot of money to the Allies. And England used its superior navy to blockade any trade from the United States or any country from entering Germany. So you see from the start US is financially invested in the Allied cause.

What starts happening is Germany decides to resort to unrestricted submarine warfare using U-boats -- submarines -- and they start sinking a series of ships. Some of the notable ones is the Lusitania -- a British passenger ship. It sunk in May of 1915 off the coast of Ireland killing almost 1,000 people including 128 Americans. Germany does apologize and pledges not to sink any more neutral ships. Things calm down for a moment but then Germany sinks other ships including that one you see right there in March of 1916. Wilson once again threatens to cut off diplomatic relations with Germany, and the US and Germany are very close to war. You could see Uncle Sam is frustrated in the political cartoon demanding that Germany stops. And Germany does issue the pledge where Germany promises we won't sink any more ships without warning those aboard.

The big issue in the election of 1916 when Wilson's running for re-election is the fact that he kept us out of the war. He reminds voters that he was the one who kept us out of war, and he easily wins re-election. However the following year the US will find itself in World War I -- but we'll cover that another day another time.
