== 释义

what’s popping 突然出现；突然发生 APUSH 美国历史课程 people? today we’re going to take a look at the period of 1854 to 1861. + 
 this is American Pageant 美国历史教科书 chapter 19, but also those other books - we got you covered. + 


so key idea from last time: in the 1850s the nation was becoming more and more polarized 两极分化的, and Northern resistance 抵抗；反对 to the Fugitive 逃亡的；短暂的 Slave Act 奴隶法案 was increasing day by day. + 
 and in 1852 a book comes out called Uncle Tom’s Cabin 汤姆叔叔的小屋 by Harriet Beecher Stowe, and this book basically inspires many many Northerners to resist the Fugitive Slave Act. + 
 the reason being is it brings the morality 道德；道义 argument to the slavery debate. + 
 it exposed the horrors 恐怖；可怕的事物 of slavery to a northern audience 观众；听众 and also Europeans, especially in England and France. + 
 it was immensely 非常；极其 popular, and as a result during the Civil War Lincoln even responds to Harriet Beecher Stowe: "so you are the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war. + 
"

and what you see is the results of Kansas-Nebraska are horrific 可怕的；令人恐惧的. + 
 it was assumed that Kansas would become a slave state and Nebraska would be a free state, and remember it basically repealed 废除；撤销 the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协案. + 
 and what happens as a consequence is bad: pro-slavery 支持奴隶制的 and anti-slavery 反对奴隶制的 forces flood into Kansas. + 
 in fact you get an abolitionist 废奴主义者 group called The New England Emigrant 移民 Aid Company sending like 2,000 free soilers 自由土壤党成员 into the area to try to ensure that popular sovereignty 人民主权论 would go the way of no slavery. + 
 you have these so-called Border Ruffians 边境暴徒 crossing the border - pro-slavery people from slave state Missouri are coming into Kansas. + 


and what you really have happening is Kansas-Nebraska was a immense 巨大的 failure. + 
 two rival 敌对的；竞争的 governments are set up: in fact you get the Free Soil government in Topeka, Kansas, and you get the pro-slave government in Lecompton. + 
 a big result of Kansas- Nebraska Act was the formation of the Republican party, and basically anybody who was opposed to the extension 延伸；扩大 of slavery in the territories - so you get anti-slavery Whigs 辉格党成员, you get free soilers, you get some Northerners from different segments 部分；片段 of the population - they rally around 团结在. + 
. + 
. + 
周围 this opposition party the Republicans, and it’s really Kansas- Nebraska that forms them. + 


now Kansas quickly spirals 急剧上升；螺旋式上升 into a civil war that’s known as Bleeding Kansas 流血的堪萨斯. + 
 open fighting takes place. + 
 there’s the sack 洗劫；劫掠 of Lawrence in 1856 where pro-slavery forces attacked the town of Lawrence, Kansas and end up killing a couple of people, destroying homes and local businesses. + 
 two days later John Brown along with his followers (his homies 朋友；伙伴) attack pro-slavery forces at Pottawatomie Creek, and what they end up doing is they literally hacked 砍；劈 to death five alleged 声称的；所谓的 pro-slavery people. + 


by 1856 you got civil war going on in Kansas between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces. + 
 there is open fighting, and this fighting spreads to Congress. + 
 Charles Sumner, an abolitionist senator from Massachusetts, gives a speech in Congress entitled "The Crime Against Kansas," and he basically is condemning 谴责 the events that are going on in Bleeding Kansas. + 
 what Charles Sumner does is he is enormously 非常；极其 disliked outside of the north. + 
 during his speech he also insults 侮辱 a southern Senator by the name of Andrew Butler, and Southerners are outraged 愤怒的 - not just for his anti-slavery speech but also because he personally insulted Andrew Butler. + 


a couple days later Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina enters into the chambers 会议厅；议院 of Congress and beats Charles Sumner with a cane 手杖 over his head until it breaks. + 
 Charles Sumner was so badly injured that he could not return to the Senate for many years. + 
 and what really is happening is the violence over slavery in Kansas has now spread to the halls 大厅；走廊 of Congress. + 
 this inspired more people to join the Republican party, but also Southerners rally around Preston Brooks. + 


now in 1856 you have an election during this tense time, and the Democratic party is running against (for the first time) the Republican party, which is running a candidate 候选人 for the presidency: John C. + 
 Fremont. + 
 the Democratic candidate is James Buchanan, and they pick him because he has nothing to do with the Kansas- Nebraska Act - he was over in London during its passage 通过, so he’s not tainted 玷污；污染 by this Kansas controversy 争议. + 


there’s also another party running which is the Know-Nothing party 一无所知党, and they pick Millard Fillmore. + 
 they’re really kind of concerned about the Irish immigrants 移民 and the Catholics 天主教徒, so they’re anti-immigrant 反移民的, anti-Catholic 反天主教的. + 
 these three parties are running, and the Republicans do pretty well for a new party with mainly only support in the north, but ultimately James Buchanan wins. + 


really James Buchanan faces one crisis 危机 after another after winning the presidency in 1856. + 
 in fact what happens in Kansas is the Lecompton Constitution. + 
 the Lecompton Constitution was drafted 起草 by pro-slavery supporters in Kansas, and it was setting up the territory as a pro-slavery constitution. + 
 the reason why it’s passed is free soilers boycott 抵制 the election - they feel like the people crossing the border from Missouri are corrupting 使腐败；使堕落 the political process of popular sovereignty, and they boycott the election. + 
 the Lecompton Constitution is approved and supported by President Buchanan but ultimately rejected by Congress. + 


so you have this battle over what Kansas was going to look like, and ultimately popular sovereignty was proving to be a failure. + 


not too long after this crisis is the biggest one, and that is The Dred Scott case. + 
 Dred Scott was a slave who sued 起诉 for his freedom. + 
 he was a slave in Missouri and his master took him to free territory in Wisconsin for like two years, and he sues based upon that: "hey I was in free soil so therefore I’m free. + 
" the case goes to the Supreme Court in 1857, and the Chief Justice 首席大法官 (a southern Democrat, this ugly dude Roger Taney) is the head of the court, and the court is dominated by Southerners. + 


the court rules a couple of things in Dred Scott:

African-Americans are not citizens of the United States, so therefore they could not sue in court. + 


since slaves are property, they cannot be taken away under the Constitution and the Fifth Amendment 第五修正案. + 
 since slaves are property, that means Congress could not make laws regarding slavery in the territories. + 
 slaves are protected - owning slaves is protected everywhere because the Constitution says it. + 


therefore the Dred Scott case not only does it rule that African-Americans are not citizens, but it also rules that slavery cannot be banned by Congress anywhere at any time. + 
 in fact the Missouri Compromise (which was already overturned because of Kansas- Nebraska Act) is unconstitutional 违宪的. + 


and for northerners and especially the Republican party, this is seen as an outrage 愤怒；愤慨. + 
 they have now the court has now opened slavery in all the territories potentially, and they condemn The Dred Scott case as a result. + 


in 1858 you have a really famous debate take place between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas (the guy from the Kansas-Nebraska Act who is a northern Democrat). + 
 they’re debating - seven debates are going to be held for the Illinois Senate seat between these two men, and these debates become really the focus of national attention. + 


Lincoln during the debates challenges Douglas on The Dred Scott decision, and he says to Douglas: "could slavery be prevented in the territories?" because according to Dred Scott the answer is no, and Southerners love that. + 
 so how is Stephen Douglas going to respond - a northerner but nonetheless a Democrat? he says in his Freeport Doctrine 弗里波特主义 that territories could limit slavery, and Southerners are pissed 生气的. + 
 so Douglas stands on principle 坚持原则 and says popular sovereignty still can happen, and he rejects the findings 调查结果 and the decision of The Dred Scott case, and that angers Southerners. + 


the results of the Lincoln- Douglas campaign and the debates is: - Douglas keeps his senate seat (he wins the election) - Lincoln becomes a national figure 人物 (he gives his famous "House Divided" speech during these debates) - Southerners are going to be bitterly 痛苦地 divided amongst one another because they’re really angry that Douglas took the position he did in the Freeport Doctrine. + 


another event that you need to know about is John Brown at Harper’s Ferry, and this the violence just escalates 升级；加剧. + 
 John Brown (the guy from Pottawatomie Creek fame) hopes to spark 引发；触发 a slave revolt 起义；反叛 in Virginia in 1859, and he goes with this plan that he is going to seize 夺取；占领 the federal arsenal 军火库 at Harper’s Ferry in Virginia. + 
 he’s going to spark a slave revolt by acquiring 获得 the guns at Harper’s Ferry. + 
 things don’t go well - he’s charged with treason 叛国罪, and he along with some of his followers are eventually hanged 绞死. + 
 there’s John Brown kissing the baby on his way to the gallows 绞刑架. + 


the impact of John Brown at Harper’s Ferry though is immense:

the south is outraged - they feel like John Brown was supported by Northerners and that he was somehow sent by the north to undermine 破坏 slavery

Brown becomes a martyr 烈士 to many abolitionists (although most Northerners don’t support his actions). + 
 he does become a martyr because he’s willing to die for the anti-slavery cause

it’s really one of the immediate causes of secession 脱离联邦 because Southerners feel like they’re under attack, and John Brown provides them proof of that attack. + 


and that leads us to the election of 1860. + 
 election of 1860 - as I said the Democrats are split amongst one another over the issue of slavery and specifically popular sovereignty and Dred Scott splits them:

the northern Democrats favor Stephen Douglas, and he supports popular sovereignty and the enforcement 执行 of the Fugitive Slave Act

the southern Democrats don’t want him to be the candidate, and you have a split at the convention 大会 where the southern Democrats favor John C. + 
 Breckinridge. + 
 Breckinridge’s position is very clear: allow slavery in the territories and annex 吞并 Cuba and make it a slave state. + 


so the Democrats are a mess. + 
 in fact the Republican Party picks that handsome fella 家伙 Lincoln as the guy who’s nominated 提名, and the Republican platform 政纲 has a little bit for everybody in the north:

for the free soilers: no extension of slavery in the territories (so they’re not going to have slavery expand - it can be where it is, they’re not against slavery)

for the northern manufacturers 制造商: protective tariff 保护性关税

for the Northwest: a railroad that would go across the country

for the farmers: free land (homesteads 家园；宅地)

and their platform is really simple. + 
 there’s also another party that runs in the election called the Constitutional Union party with John Bell, and they basically try to avoid the issue of slavery. + 
 their whole position is "enforce the Constitution and the laws of the nation. + 
"

Southerners/secessionists say if Lincoln wins they’re going to leave the union, so let’s see what happens in 1860. + 
 the results:

Lincoln/the Republican Party wins the presidency for the first time

the problem though is he is a minority president: he gets less than 40% of the popular vote 普选票

he does get enough of the electoral vote 选举人票, but he is not a president with a large margin 差额；幅度 of support

in fact Southerners see him as a sectional 地区的 president: he’s not even on the ballot 选票 in 10 southern states

and so when Lincoln wins the presidency, Southerners - South Carolina’s the first - vote for secession in December of 1860, and by the time Lincoln takes office seven Southern States (in the blue on that map) are going to be gone from the union. + 
 they are going to leave the union because they see him as a sectional president hostile 敌对的 to the institution 制度 of slavery. + 


they create the Confederate 邦联的 States of America. + 
 they nominate a president, Jefferson Davis, and the president at the time James Buchanan is still in office from November 1860 to March of 1861. + 
 he’s a lame duck 跛脚鸭 - he’s basically waiting for the incoming president to take office. + 
 he does nothing to stop secession - he does not believe that secession is legal but he doesn’t really feel like he has any options to do anything about these Southern States leaving. + 


there is one last attempt at compromise - can we get one more? - and that is the Crittenden Compromise. + 
 it is an attempt to avoid a major crisis, and it hopes to calm Southern fears. + 
 it basically has a really simple idea: let’s return the idea of the Missouri Compromise. + 
 slavery would be prohibited 禁止 in territories north of 36°30' and it would be allowed in territory south. + 
 but ultimately Lincoln and the Republican Party reject this because their platform in 1860 was no extension of slavery in the territories. + 


and of course seven southern states will have left the union before Lincoln even enters the White House. + 
 that’s all for this chapter. + 
 hopefully you learned some stuff. + 
 if you haven’t done so, subscribe, like the video, post some questions, tell like 20 friends about the channel, and peace. +

各位APUSH的同学们，大家好！今天我们要探讨1854年至1861年这段时期。这是《美国纪事》的第19章，但其他几本书的相关章节我们也都会涵盖。

上次讲座的关键思想：在1850年代，国家日益分裂，北方对《逃奴法》的抵制日益增强。1852年，哈丽特·比彻·斯托夫人出版了一本名为《汤姆叔叔的小屋》的书，这本书基本上激励了许多北方人抵制《逃奴法》。原因是它将道德论证带入了奴隶制辩论。它向北方读者以及欧洲人，尤其是在英国和法国，揭露了奴隶制的恐怖。这本书非常受欢迎，因此在内战期间，林肯甚至对哈丽特·比彻·斯托夫人回应说：“原来你就是那位写了引发这场伟大战争的书的小妇人。”

你所看到的是，《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》的后果是可怕的。人们认为堪萨斯会成为一个蓄奴州，而内布拉斯加会成为一个自由州，记住，该法案基本上废除了《密苏里妥协案》。结果是糟糕的：支持奴隶制和反对奴隶制的势力涌入了堪萨斯。事实上，一个名为“新英格兰移民援助公司”的废奴主义团体派遣了大约2000名自由土地主义者到该地区，试图确保人民主权不会允许奴隶制。你看到了所谓的“边境暴徒”越过边境——来自蓄奴州密苏里的亲奴隶制人士涌入堪萨斯。

你真正看到的是，《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》是一个巨大的失败。成立了两个对立的政府：事实上，你在堪萨斯州的托皮卡看到了自由土地政府，而在利康普顿看到了亲奴隶制政府。《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》的一个重大结果是共和党的成立，基本上任何反对在领土上扩张奴隶制的人——所以你看到了反对奴隶制的辉格党人，你看到了自由土地主义者，你看到了来自不同社会阶层的北方人——他们团结在这个反对党共和党周围，而真正促成他们成立的是《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》。

堪萨斯很快陷入了一场被称为“流血的堪萨斯”的内战。公开的战斗爆发了。1856年发生了劳伦斯之劫，亲奴隶制势力袭击了堪萨斯州的劳伦斯镇，最终杀死了几个人，摧毁了房屋和当地企业。两天后，约翰·布朗和他的追随者（他的朋友们）在波塔瓦托米溪袭击了亲奴隶制势力，他们最终用刀砍死了五名所谓的亲奴隶制人士。

到1856年，堪萨斯州亲奴隶制和反奴隶制势力之间爆发了内战。公开的战斗正在进行，这场战斗蔓延到了国会。马萨诸塞州的废奴主义参议员查尔斯·萨姆纳在国会发表了一篇题为《反对堪萨斯的罪行》的演讲，他基本上谴责了在“流血的堪萨斯”发生的事件。查尔斯·萨姆纳在北方以外非常不受欢迎。在他的演讲中，他还侮辱了一位名叫安德鲁·巴特勒的南方参议员，南方人非常愤怒——不仅因为他的反奴隶制演讲，还因为他个人侮辱了安德鲁·巴特勒。

几天后，南卡罗来纳州的众议员普雷斯顿·布鲁克斯进入国会会议厅，用他的手杖猛击查尔斯·萨姆纳的头部，直到手杖断裂。查尔斯·萨姆纳伤势严重，多年无法重返参议院。真正发生的是，堪萨斯州因奴隶制而发生的暴力事件现在蔓延到了国会大厅。这激励了更多人加入共和党，但南方人也团结在普雷斯顿·布鲁克斯周围。

现在，在1856年这个紧张时期，举行了一次选举，民主党（第一次）与共和党竞争，共和党推选了一位总统候选人：约翰·C·弗里蒙特。民主党候选人是詹姆斯·布坎南，他们选择他是因为他与《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》没有任何关系——该法案通过期间他在伦敦，所以他没有受到堪萨斯争议的玷污。

还有一个政党参与竞选，那就是“一无所知党”，他们推选了米勒德·菲尔莫尔。他们真正关心的是爱尔兰移民和天主教徒，所以他们是反移民、反天主教的。这三个政党都在竞选，共和党作为一个主要只在北方获得支持的新政党表现相当不错，但最终詹姆斯·布坎南获胜了。

实际上，詹姆斯·布坎南在1856年赢得总统职位后，面临着一个又一个危机。事实上，堪萨斯州发生的事情是《利康普顿宪法》。《利康普顿宪法》由堪萨斯州的亲奴隶制支持者起草，旨在将该领土建立为一个亲奴隶制的宪法。该宪法得以通过的原因是自由土地主义者抵制了选举——他们认为来自密苏里州的越境者正在腐蚀人民主权的政治进程，因此他们抵制了选举。《利康普顿宪法》得到了布坎南总统的批准和支持，但最终被国会否决了。

因此，你看到了关于堪萨斯州将是什么样子的这场斗争，最终证明人民主权是一个失败。

这场危机后不久，就发生了最大的危机，那就是德雷德·斯科特案。德雷德·斯科特是一位起诉要求获得自由的奴隶。他是密苏里州的一名奴隶，他的主人带他去了威斯康星州的自由领地大约两年，他以此为由起诉：“嘿，我曾在自由土地上，所以我现在是自由的。”该案于1857年上诉到最高法院，首席大法官（南方民主党人，那个丑陋的家伙罗杰·托尼）是法院的负责人，法院由南方人主导。

法院在德雷德·斯科特案中裁决了几件事：

非裔美国人不是美国公民，因此他们不能在法庭上起诉。
由于奴隶是财产，因此不能根据宪法第五修正案将其剥夺。由于奴隶是财产，这意味着国会不能在领土上制定有关奴隶制的法律。奴隶受到保护——拥有奴隶在任何地方都受到保护，因为宪法是这样规定的。
因此，德雷德·斯科特案不仅裁定非裔美国人不是公民，而且还裁定国会不能在任何时间、任何地点禁止奴隶制。事实上，《密苏里妥协案》（由于《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》已被推翻）是违宪的。

对于北方人，尤其是共和党来说，这被视为一种暴行。法院现在已经潜在地在所有领土上开放了奴隶制，因此他们谴责了德雷德·斯科特案。

1858年，亚伯拉罕·林肯和斯蒂芬·道格拉斯（《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》的提出者，一位北方民主党人）之间进行了一场非常著名的辩论。他们正在辩论——两人将为伊利诺伊州参议员席位进行七场辩论，这些辩论成为全国关注的焦点。

在辩论中，林肯就德雷德·斯科特案的裁决质问道格拉斯，他对道格拉斯说：“奴隶制能否在领土上被阻止？”因为根据德雷德·斯科特案的裁决，答案是否定的，而南方人喜欢这个答案。那么，斯蒂芬·道格拉斯——一个北方人，但仍然是一个民主党人——将如何回应？他在他的“自由港原则”中说，领土可以限制奴隶制，南方人对此非常愤怒。因此，道格拉斯坚持原则，说人民主权仍然可以实现，他拒绝了德雷德·斯科特案的调查结果和裁决，这激怒了南方人。

林肯-道格拉斯竞选和辩论的结果是：——道格拉斯保住了他的参议员席位（他赢得了选举）——林肯成为全国性人物（他在这些辩论中发表了他著名的“分裂之家”演讲）——南方人将彼此之间产生严重分歧，因为他们对道格拉斯在自由港原则中采取的立场非常愤怒。

你需要了解的另一个事件是约翰·布朗在哈珀斯费里的行动，暴力事件进一步升级。约翰·布朗（波塔瓦托米溪事件的著名人物）希望在1859年在弗吉尼亚州引发一场奴隶起义，他计划夺取弗吉尼亚州哈珀斯费里的联邦军械库。他打算通过获取哈珀斯费里的枪支来引发奴隶起义。事情进展不顺利——他被指控叛国罪，他和一些追随者最终被绞死。这是约翰·布朗在前往绞刑架的路上亲吻婴儿的照片。

然而，约翰·布朗在哈珀斯费里的行动的影响是巨大的：

南方非常愤怒——他们认为约翰·布朗得到了北方人的支持，并且北方以某种方式派他来破坏奴隶制。
布朗成为许多废奴主义者的殉道者（尽管大多数北方人不支持他的行动）。他确实成为了一位殉道者，因为他愿意为反奴隶制事业而死。
这实际上是导致南方脱离联邦的直接原因之一，因为南方人感到他们受到了攻击，而约翰·布朗为他们提供了这次攻击的证据。
这就引出了1860年的选举。正如我所说，1860年的选举——民主党在奴隶制问题上，特别是人民主权和德雷德·斯科特案问题上存在严重分裂：

北方民主党人支持斯蒂芬·道格拉斯，他支持人民主权和执行《逃奴法》。
南方民主党人不想让他成为候选人，在大会上发生了分裂，南方民主党人支持约翰·C·布雷肯里奇。布雷肯里奇的立场非常明确：允许在领土上实行奴隶制，吞并古巴并使其成为一个蓄奴州。
因此，民主党一团糟。事实上，共和党推选了那位英俊的林肯作为被提名人，而共和党的纲领为北方的每个人都提供了一些东西：

对于自由土地主义者：不在领土上扩张奴隶制（所以他们不会让奴隶制扩张——它可以存在于它现在存在的地方，他们不反对奴隶制）。
对于北方制造商：保护性关税。
对于西北地区：一条横跨全国的铁路。
对于农民：自由土地（宅地）。
他们的纲领非常简单。还有另一个政党参加了选举，那就是宪法联盟党，候选人是约翰·贝尔，他们基本上试图回避奴隶制问题。他们的全部立场是“执行宪法和国家法律”。

南方分裂分子说，如果林肯获胜，他们将脱离联邦，让我们看看1860年发生了什么。结果是：

林肯/共和党第一次赢得总统职位。
但问题是他是一位少数派总统：他获得的普选票不到40%。
他确实获得了足够的选举人票，但他并不是一位拥有广泛支持的总统。
事实上，南方人认为他是一位地区性总统：他在10个南方州甚至没有出现在选票上。
因此，当林肯赢得总统职位时，南方各州——南卡罗来纳州是第一个——在1860年12月投票决定脱离联邦，到林肯就职时，七个南方州（地图上的蓝色部分）将脱离联邦。他们脱离联邦是因为他们认为林肯是一位敌视奴隶制机构的地区性总统。

他们创建了美利坚联盟国。他们提名了一位总统，杰斐逊·戴维斯，而当时的总统詹姆斯·布坎南仍然在1860年11月至1861年3月在任。他是一个跛脚鸭总统——他基本上在等待即将上任的总统就职。他没有采取任何措施阻止分裂——他不相信分裂是合法的，但他真的觉得他没有任何办法阻止这些南方州脱离联邦。

还有最后一次妥协的尝试——我们还能再妥协一次吗？——那就是克里滕登妥协案。这是为了避免重大危机的尝试，它希望平息南方人的担忧。它基本上有一个非常简单的想法：让我们恢复《密苏里妥协案》的思想。奴隶制将在北纬36°30′以北的领土上被禁止，而在南方的领土上将被允许。但最终林肯和共和党拒绝了这一点，因为他们1860年的纲领是不在领土上扩张奴隶制。

当然，在林肯甚至进入白宫之前，七个南方州就已经脱离了联邦。本章就到此为止。希望你学到了一些东西。如果你还没有这样做，请订阅，点赞这个视频，提出一些问题，告诉大约20个朋友关于这个频道，再见。

what's popping APUSH people? today we're
going to take a look at the period of
1854 to 1861. this is American Pageant
chapter 19, but also those other books - we
got you covered.

so key idea from last time: in the 1850s the nation was
becoming more and more polarized, and
Northern resistance to the Fugitive
Slave Act was increasing day by day. and
in 1852 a book comes out called Uncle
Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, and
this book basically inspires many
many Northerners to resist the Fugitive
Slave Act. the reason being is it
brings the morality argument to the
slavery debate. it exposed the horrors
of slavery to a northern audience and
also Europeans, especially in England and
France. it was immensely popular, and as a
result during the Civil War Lincoln
even responds to Harriet Beecher Stowe:
"so you are the little woman who wrote the
book that made this great war."

and what you see is the results of
Kansas-Nebraska are horrific. it was
assumed that Kansas would become a slave
state and Nebraska would be a free state,
and remember it basically
repealed the Missouri Compromise. and
what happens as a consequence is bad:
pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces
flood into Kansas. in fact you get an
abolitionist group called The New
England Emigrant Aid Company sending
like 2,000 free soilers into the area
to try to ensure that popular
sovereignty would go the way of no
slavery. you have these so-called Border
Ruffians crossing the border - pro-slavery
people from slave state Missouri are
coming into Kansas.

and what you really
have happening is Kansas-Nebraska was a
immense failure. two rival governments
are set up: in fact you get the Free Soil
government in Topeka, Kansas, and you get
the pro-slave government in Lecompton.
a big result of Kansas-
Nebraska Act was the formation of the
Republican party, and basically anybody
who was opposed to the extension of
slavery in the territories - so you get
anti-slavery Whigs, you get free soilers,
you get some Northerners from different segments of the population -
they rally around this opposition party
the Republicans, and it's really Kansas-
Nebraska that forms them.

now Kansas
quickly spirals into a civil war that's
known as Bleeding Kansas. open fighting
takes place. there's the sack of Lawrence
in 1856 where pro-slavery forces
attacked the town of Lawrence, Kansas and
end up killing a couple of people,
destroying homes and local businesses.
two days later John Brown along with his
followers (his homies) attack pro-slavery
forces at Pottawatomie Creek, and what they end
up doing is they literally hacked to
death five alleged pro-slavery people.

by 1856 you got civil war going on
in Kansas between pro-slavery and
anti-slavery forces. there is open
fighting, and this fighting spreads to
Congress. Charles Sumner, an
abolitionist senator from
Massachusetts, gives a speech in Congress
entitled "The Crime Against Kansas,"
and he basically is condemning the
events that are going on in Bleeding
Kansas. what Charles Sumner does is he
is enormously disliked outside of the
north. during his speech he also
insults a southern Senator by the name
of Andrew Butler, and Southerners are
outraged - not just for his anti-slavery
speech but also because he
personally insulted Andrew Butler.

a couple days later Congressman Preston
Brooks of South Carolina enters into the
chambers of Congress and beats Charles
Sumner with a cane over his head until it
breaks. Charles Sumner was so badly injured
that he could not return to the
Senate for many years. and what really is
happening is the violence over slavery
in Kansas has now spread to the halls of
Congress. this inspired more people
to join the Republican party, but also
Southerners rally around Preston
Brooks.

now in 1856 you have an election during
this tense time, and the Democratic party
is running against (for the first time)
the Republican party, which is running a
candidate for the presidency: John C.
Fremont. the Democratic candidate is
James Buchanan, and they pick him because
he has nothing to do with the Kansas-
Nebraska Act - he was over in London
during its passage, so he's not tainted
by this Kansas controversy.

there's also another party
running which is the Know-Nothing party,
and they pick Millard Fillmore. they're
really kind of concerned about the Irish immigrants and the Catholics, so they're anti-immigrant,
anti-Catholic. these three parties
are running, and the Republicans do
pretty well for a new party with mainly
only support in the north, but ultimately
James Buchanan wins.

really James
Buchanan faces one crisis after another
after winning the presidency in 1856.
in fact what happens in Kansas
is the Lecompton Constitution. the Lecompton Constitution was drafted by
pro-slavery supporters in Kansas, and it
was setting up the territory as a pro-slavery constitution. the
reason why it's passed is free soilers
boycott the election - they feel like the
people crossing the border
from Missouri are corrupting the
political process of popular sovereignty,
and they boycott the election. the
Lecompton Constitution is approved and
supported by President Buchanan but
ultimately rejected by Congress.

so you have this battle over what Kansas
was going to look like, and ultimately
popular sovereignty was proving to be a
failure.

not too long after this crisis
is the biggest one, and that is The Dred
Scott case. Dred Scott was a slave who
sued for his freedom. he was a slave in
Missouri and his master took him to free territory in Wisconsin for
like two years, and he sues based upon
that: "hey I was in free soil so therefore
I'm free." the case goes to the Supreme
Court in 1857, and the Chief Justice (a
southern Democrat, this ugly dude Roger
Taney) is the head of the court, and the
court is dominated by Southerners.

the court rules a couple of things in
Dred Scott:

1. African-Americans are
not citizens of the United States, so
therefore they could not sue in court.
2. since slaves are property, they
cannot be taken away under the
Constitution and the Fifth Amendment.
since slaves are property, that means
Congress could not make laws regarding
slavery in the territories. slaves are
protected - owning slaves is protected
everywhere because the Constitution says
it.

therefore the Dred Scott case
not only does it rule that
African-Americans are not citizens, but
it also rules that slavery cannot be
banned by Congress anywhere at any time.
in fact the Missouri Compromise (which
was already overturned because of Kansas-
Nebraska Act) is unconstitutional.

and for northerners and especially the
Republican party, this is seen as an
outrage. they have now the court has now
opened slavery in all the territories
potentially, and they condemn The Dred
Scott case as a result.

in 1858 you have a really famous
debate take place between Abraham
Lincoln and Stephen Douglas (the guy from
the Kansas-Nebraska Act who is a
northern Democrat). they're debating - seven debates are
going to be held for the Illinois
Senate seat between these two men, and
these debates become really the focus of national attention.

Lincoln during the debates challenges Douglas on
The Dred Scott decision, and he says to
Douglas: "could slavery be prevented in
the territories?" because according to Dred
Scott the answer is no, and Southerners
love that. so how is Stephen Douglas going
to respond - a northerner but nonetheless
a Democrat? he says
in his Freeport Doctrine that
territories could limit slavery, and
Southerners are pissed. so Douglas stands
on principle and says popular
sovereignty still can happen, and he
rejects the findings and the decision of
The Dred Scott case, and that angers
Southerners.

the results of the Lincoln-
Douglas campaign and the debates is:
- Douglas keeps his senate seat (he wins
the election)
- Lincoln becomes a national
figure (he gives his famous "House Divided"
speech during these debates)
- Southerners are going to be
bitterly divided amongst one another
because they're really angry that
Douglas took the position he did in the
Freeport Doctrine.

another event that you need to
know about is John Brown at Harper's
Ferry, and this the violence just
escalates. John Brown (the guy from Pottawatomie
Creek fame) hopes to spark a slave revolt
in Virginia in 1859, and he goes with this plan that he
is going to seize the federal arsenal at
Harper's Ferry in Virginia. he's going to
spark a slave revolt by acquiring the
guns at Harper's Ferry. things don't go
well - he's charged with treason, and he
along with some of his followers are
eventually hanged. there's John Brown
kissing the baby on his way to the
gallows.

the impact of John Brown at
Harper's Ferry though is immense:

- the south
is outraged - they feel like John Brown
was supported by Northerners
and that he was somehow sent by the
north to undermine slavery
- Brown becomes
a martyr to many abolitionists (although
most Northerners don't support his
actions). he does become a martyr because
he's willing to die for the anti-slavery
cause
- it's really one of the
immediate causes of secession because
Southerners feel like they're under
attack, and John Brown provides them
proof of that attack.

and that leads us to the election of 1860.
election of 1860 - as I said the
Democrats are split amongst one another
over the issue of slavery and specifically
popular sovereignty and Dred Scott
splits them:

- the northern Democrats
favor Stephen Douglas, and he supports
popular sovereignty and the enforcement
of the Fugitive Slave Act
- the southern Democrats don't want him to be
the candidate, and you have a split at
the convention where the southern
Democrats favor John C. Breckinridge.
Breckinridge's position is very clear:
allow slavery in the territories and
annex Cuba and make it a slave state.

so the Democrats are a mess. in fact the
Republican Party picks that handsome
fella Lincoln as the guy who's nominated,
and the Republican platform has a little
bit for everybody in the north:

- for the free soilers: no extension of slavery in the
territories (so they're not going to have slavery expand - it can be where it is, they're not against slavery)
- for the northern manufacturers: protective
tariff
- for the Northwest: a
railroad that would go across the country
- for the farmers: free land (homesteads)

and their platform is really
simple. there's also another party that
runs in the election called the
Constitutional Union party with John
Bell, and they basically try to avoid the
issue of slavery. their whole position is
"enforce the Constitution and the laws of
the nation."

Southerners/secessionists say
if Lincoln wins they're going to leave
the union, so let's see what happens in
1860. the results:

- Lincoln/the Republican
Party wins the presidency for the first time
- the problem though is he is a
minority president: he gets less than 40%
of the popular vote
- he does get enough
of the electoral vote, but he is not a
president with a large margin of support
- in fact Southerners see him as a
sectional president: he's not even on the
ballot in 10 southern states

and so when
Lincoln wins the presidency, Southerners -
South Carolina's the first - vote for
secession in December of 1860, and by the time Lincoln takes
office seven Southern States (in the blue
on that map) are going to be gone from
the union. they are going to leave
the union because they see him as a
sectional president hostile to the
institution of slavery.

they create the
Confederate States of America. they
nominate a president, Jefferson Davis,
and the president at the time James
Buchanan is still in office from
November 1860 to March of 1861. he's a
lame duck - he's basically waiting for the
incoming president to take office. he
does nothing to stop secession - he does
not believe that secession is legal but
he doesn't really feel like he has any
options to do anything about these
Southern States leaving.

there is one
last attempt at compromise - can we get
one more? - and that is the Crittenden
Compromise. it is an attempt to avoid
a major crisis, and it hopes to calm
Southern fears. it basically has a
really simple idea: let's return the idea
of the Missouri Compromise. slavery would
be prohibited in territories north of 36°30' and it would be allowed in
territory south. but ultimately Lincoln
and the Republican Party reject this
because their platform in
1860 was no extension of slavery in the
territories.

and of course seven southern states will
have left the union before Lincoln even
enters the White House. that's all for
this chapter. hopefully you learned some
