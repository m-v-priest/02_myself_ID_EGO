Greetings, everyone. Today we're taking a look at Eisenhower's Administration 艾森豪威尔政府 and the 1950s. We're going to cover you for any APUSH or regular US history textbook, and really you can't understand the 1950s without understanding Eisenhower.

The Republican candidate Dwight Eisenhower was elected in 1952. He is a moderate Republican 温和的共和党人 -- remember him from D-Day, the head of NATO -- and he has with him the hardcore anti-communist 强硬反共的 Richard Nixon as his vice president. And you'll remember Nixon from the Alger Hiss case. And he's a political moderate -- he's not really interested in any New Deal, Fair Deal. He is a Republican -- he likes balanced budgets 平衡预算, he doesn't want a large federal government, but he's going to let many of the New Deal programs continue on. Such as Social Security benefits 社会保障福利 are actually going to be extended under Eisenhower. The minimum wage 最低工资 is going to be increased. But he's not pushing a huge domestic reform program during his administration.

In spite of that, the largest public works project 公共工程项目 ever in our history is going to be adopted under the Eisenhower Administration, and that's the Interstate Highway Act 州际公路法案 in 1956. And you could see on the map all of the highway construction that takes place under this act. It provides for the building of 42,000 miles of interstate highways, and it's justified partially as necessary for national defense 国防 -- so if there is a new attack, this would allow people to evacuate cities much easier. It has huge consequences: it creates jobs, it leads to the growth of the suburbs 郊区 and white flight 白人迁移 from major cities, and it also allows for a more standardized American culture. As Americans are traveling further away from their cities, they want the conveniences of home -- so for example, you get the creation of McDonald's in the 1950s.

It's important to understand the changes in society and the economics of the 1950s, and really the decade can be defined as pretty economically prosperous. There's a rise of the American middle class 中产阶级. There is increased social mobility 社会流动性 as people are able to pick up their economic status. And it is the first time in history in which white-collar workers 白领 workers in America outnumber blue-collar workers 蓝领工人. There's a transition -- we are becoming a post-industrial society 后工业社会. And as a result, union membership 工会成员 is going to decline following the 1950s.

Post-World War II, we have a continuation of that stuff we saw immediately after the war -- the move to the suburbs. You have the creation of standardized housing 标准化住房 in places like Levittown. Important to note that African-Americans were not allowed to purchase homes in many of these suburban neighborhoods. And of course, you have the baby boom 婴儿潮 going on in the 1950s as well.

Credit cards 信用卡 are introduced in the 1950s. You always had the installment plan 分期付款计划 since the 1920s, but now you actually have that plastic where you could swipe, and this allows for an increase in consumerism 消费主义. You could buy things you normally could not afford. And of course, the big hot item in the 1950s is the television, and it becomes a common household item. And once again, just like the radio in the '20s, we have this kind of standardization of American culture -- people are all watching the same thing.

Of course, anytime you have change, you have cultural changes, you're going to have tensions. In fact, the rise of television led to questions regarding the nation's morals and politics and all sorts of other issues, and we continue to have those debates today. Television glamorized the suburban life -- you have shows like "Leave It to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" in which the white suburban family had this perfect little existence, and the woman homemaker 家庭主妇 is often times celebrated. In fact, the cult of domesticity 家庭生活崇拜 is celebrated and reinforced in these television shows. As you could see in this scene right here -- mom stays home, bakes cookies; dad goes off to the office.

There are examples of tension in the 1950s you should be aware of. For example, at the end of the decade, Betty Friedan writes "The Feminine Mystique," which is a harsh criticism of America's treatment of women and the cult of domesticity, and it's really seen as the beginning of the modern women's rights movement 女权运动. And in the '60s, you're going to see this movement explode.

Rock and roll music 摇滚乐 kind of comes up in the 1950s. It's really out of the black community, but people like Elvis Presley bring it into the mainstream society 主流社会. And many of the older generation did not like the moves of Elvis Presley and the messages they felt young people were receiving. You also have people like Marilyn Monroe. Playboy magazine was founded in the 1950s -- people challenging this cult of domesticity and bringing sexuality and challenging sexual norms.

And most famously, you have the Beats -- the Beat Generation 垮掉的一代, the beatniks -- people such as Jack Kerouac who wrote the book "On the Road," Allen Ginsberg famous for his poem "Howl" and others, which really criticize the conformity 顺从, the consumerism of the 1950s. And they are the counterculture 反主流文化 of the decade.

A big part of the '50s though is the civil rights movement 民权运动, and it's important to keep in mind that since Reconstruction ended way back in 1877, the issue of civil rights was very slow to progress. We did see the formation of Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法 throughout the South, and in the North, there was de facto discrimination 事实上的歧视. We're not going to cover all the things that were happening, but we saw the seeds of change happening over the last couple of decades. World War II -- new civil rights organizations such as CORE and an increase in the membership of the NAACP starts to kind of get some movement going. Truman desegregated 废除种族隔离 the military with his executive order and sought under his Fair Deal to introduce civil rights proposals.

In the 1950s though, the big moment is Brown v. Board of Education. The NAACP had been trying to overturn the Plessy decision of "separate but equal." One of their lawyers, Thurgood Marshall, gets the case along with others to the Supreme Court, and in Brown's decision, they rule -- the court rules -- separate facilities are inherently unequal. Plessy v. Ferguson in the Brown case is ruled unconstitutional, and the court rules that schools must be desegregated with "all deliberate speed."

In spite of this legal victory in the Brown case, change was slow. In fact, Southern defiance 南方反抗 was extremely high. Over 100 congressmen signed the Southern Manifesto 南方宣言 which condemned the Brown Supreme Court decision. They called the decision "a clear abuse of judicial power 司法权力滥用." In fact, the showdown is going to occur in 1956-57 where the governor with the worst name ever -- Orville Faubus of Arkansas -- is going to use the state's National Guard 国民警卫队 to prevent the Little Rock Nine (you see them right below) from attending Little Rock Central High School.

As the African-American students try to attend school, violent mobs 暴民 congregate in the area, and images on television of Southern defiance pressured Eisenhower to act. And he finally does when he sends federal troops to escort the Little Rock Nine to Central High, as you can see below. Orville Faubus is not too happy about that. But keep in mind, the president has a constitutional duty to uphold federal authority.

Even prior to this event, the civil rights movement was continuing. In Montgomery, Alabama, the arrest of Rosa Parks in 1955 sparks the famous bus boycott 巴士抵制运动 in Montgomery. And of course, Martin Luther King rises to prominence as the leader of the nonviolent movement 非暴力运动. King is inspired by the work of Gandhi and Henry David Thoreau from the Mexican-American War time period. And the bus boycott will inspire other civil rights protests across the country.

In fact, the civil rights movement in the '50s and into the '60s is going to grow and continue to grow. It's a grassroots movement 草根运动 -- the government is not coming to the defense of civil rights in the beginning. You get groups like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 南方基督教领袖会议 -- rooted in the black churches -- which is going to play a key role in the civil rights movement coordinating the different actions.

In 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, college students start the sit-in movement 静坐运动 after being denied service at a segregated lunch counter at Woolworth's -- once again using the tactic of nonviolence. Ordinary civil rights heroes fighting to create change. And an important organization you're going to see throughout the 1960s is the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee 学生非暴力协调委员会, which is going to play a key role in coordinating and organizing the civil rights movement -- from the sit-ins to the freedom rides and so on. And as I mentioned, these various grassroots movements are going to pressure for civil rights well into the 1960s.

Another key part of the decade is the fact that the Cold War is going to continue under Eisenhower. And his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, is actually going to challenge the idea of containment 遏制政策. And he talks about brinksmanship 边缘政策, and the idea behind it was to defeat communism and to roll back communist gains. Perhaps we need to liberate Eastern Europe -- challenge communism and push them back, push them to the brink of war, and they would back down. They felt that containment was too weak, too passive of a policy. And Dulles was famous for this idea.

They also talked about the "New Look" policy 新面貌政策 where the US should build up its nuclear weapons to deter communist aggression. Part of this was this idea of "more bang for the buck" -- that building up these atomic weapons would be more efficient than conventional military spending. The problem with this policy is you can't use these weapons in smaller conflicts, and there's also the threat of massive retaliation 大规模报复 which kept the two superpowers from fighting one another directly.

It's important to note that this was more rhetoric than reality. We're not really going to try to defeat communism. Eisenhower, like Truman, wants to avoid World War III whenever possible. In fact, in 1953, Eisenhower helps end the Korean War with an armistice 停战协定, and Korea remains divided at the 38th parallel.

Another example of not really kind of wanting to escalate the conflict is during the Hungarian Revolution 匈牙利革命 -- right there in the Eastern Bloc in 1956. Eisenhower does not have the US come to the aid of the anti-Soviet rebellions. Hungarians rebel and topple Soviet rule for a brief period, and without outside support from the United States, the Hungarian Revolution is crushed by the Soviet Union. Ike knew that if the US tried to aid the Hungarian rebels, this could lead to a potential war in Europe, and he was not interested in doing this.

There are going to be some changes under Eisenhower with regard to the Cold War. In fact, Stalin unexpectedly dies in 1953 -- there's his dead body for your weirdos that like that kind of thing -- and Eisenhower calls for a relaxation of tensions 缓和紧张局势 and a reduction in the arms race 军备竞赛. He's really worried about this excessive spending and this threat of nuclear war. He proposes an "Atoms for Peace" plan 原子能和平利用计划 to try to kind of reduce the likelihood of all-out nuclear war.

And in 1955, a historic moment happens when Eisenhower met with Soviet leaders at Geneva. And although they didn't come up with any firm, concrete agreements, there is this talk of a "spirit of Geneva" 日内瓦精神 amongst the two superpowers. This is really the first thaw 解冻 of the Cold War -- a relaxation of tensions. The new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in a speech talked about peaceful coexistence 和平共处 with the United States. So there's this kind of period where the US and the Soviet relationship is thawing a bit.

However, you're going to see that this is not going to end the Cold War. As we saw, the Hungarian Revolution is crushed. In 1957, the Soviet Union shocks the US and the world when they launched the first satellite -- Sputnik 人造卫星 -- which makes many Americans fear that we were technologically behind the Soviet Union, and it leads to calls for an increase of federal spending to improve education, especially in math and science. So you get the National Defense Education Act 国防教育法案 passed. You also get NASA created in 1958 to help develop technology such as missiles and space exploration. And a big part of the Cold War is not just an arms race but also a space race 太空竞赛.

And a real kind of blow to this kind of détente 缓和 -- this relaxation of tensions -- occurs in 1960 when a U-2 spy plane U-2侦察机 -- a US U-2 spy plane -- was shot down by the Soviet Union, and a pilot was taken hostage. And that leads to the cancellation of a planned summit between the US and the Soviet Union. So tensions remain high during Eisenhower's Administration as well.

A really important idea that you should know about is this idea of decolonization 非殖民化. After World War II, the collapse of colonial empires leads to both the US and the Soviet Union competing for influence in places like Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. You're going to have various nationalist movements which are going to try to gain their independence, and the US and the Soviets are going to try to use these areas as pawns of the Cold War. These areas lack political and economic stability, and therefore the US and the Soviets are going to try to gain influence.

Under Eisenhower, the Cold War expands into the Middle East. There's a fear of Soviet expansion. In fact, Eisenhower is going to use the CIA to undermine communist governments or to install pro-US regimes in places like Iran and Guatemala. And this covert action 秘密行动 is less expensive and subject to less public criticism because people don't often times know about it. And for example, in 1953, the CIA helps overthrow the elected government of Iran in Operation Ajax when it attempts to nationalize -- to take over -- foreign oil companies. The CIA helps return the Shah of Iran 伊朗国王 to power, and he is a really brutal dictator, but he's pro-US, and he gives us good oil prices, so we overlook his dictator tendencies. This obviously leads to a lot of resentment in places like the Middle East.

Another example of problems in the Middle East occurs when the Suez Crisis 苏伊士运河危机 -- the president of Egypt, a nationalist by the name of Nasser, nationalizes the Suez Canal that was controlled by France and England. And his taking over of the canal angers France and England and leads England, France, and Israel to attack Egypt. And Eisenhower is quite angry because he was not consulted. He condemns the attack and forces the withdrawal. Important to keep in mind though is Eisenhower issues the Eisenhower Doctrine 艾森豪威尔主义, and this is basically the Truman Doctrine for the Middle East. The US promises economic and military aid to any country in the Middle East threatened by communism. And important to note, the US is going to play a key role in the Middle East, and very often we're going to be aligning ourselves with countries that are not democratic as long as they're not communist.

Another thing happens in 1960 when you have the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 石油输出国组织 -- countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, and Venezuela -- which are going to try to maintain their leverage in the oil trade.

Under Eisenhower, you're also going to see the Cold War kind of move over into Latin America. Just like in Iran, you have the CIA in Guatemala helping to overthrow the democratically elected leftist government. Since they're a socialist government, the US does not want them in power. And following the CIA coup 政变, a brutal dictator comes to power in Guatemala.

Another event happens in Cuba in 1959. Fidel Castro leads a revolution which removes the Cuban dictator Batista from power. Castro at first is not aligned with the Soviet Union, but he begins to nationalize American-owned businesses, which creates tension between the US and Cuba. And Eisenhower orders an embargo on Cuba -- shuts off trade -- which puts Castro into the arms (literally) of the Soviet Union. There, Castro and Khrushchev are having a hug session. Cuba moves closer to the Soviet Union. The Eisenhower Administration initiates a plan to have the CIA training Cuban exiles to try to overthrow Castro. We'll see how that works out next time.

And finally, it's important you understand what Eisenhower's role was in the Vietnam conflict. And if you click on those two videos, you're going to get super smart, and we're going to break it down for you.

When Eisenhower leaves the presidency, he gives his farewell address 告别演说. And in this address, Eisenhower warns about the dangers of the military-industrial complex 军工复合体. And his concern was that the US was spending too much money on the arms race, and it would have a negative impact on US society. And it's something that's still debated today -- the amount of money spent on national defense.

Please keep in mind when you're studying this chapter to compare and contrast Cold War success and failures of Truman and Eisenhower and other presidents. For example, Ike called for a relaxation of tensions between the US and the Soviets and initiated the first arms control efforts while at the same time broadening the Cold War to new areas like the Middle East and using the CIA in places like Iran and Guatemala to undermine elected governments. So there's a mixed legacy there.

That's going to do it for today. Hopefully, you learned a whole bunch of stuff. Stop Stalin and subscribe to Joe's Productions. If the video helped you out, click like. If you have any questions, post a comment. And have a beautiful day. Peace.

大家好。今天我们来探讨艾森豪威尔政府和20世纪50年代。我们将涵盖任何APUSH或常规美国历史教科书的内容，并且真正理解20世纪50年代离不开理解艾森豪威尔。

共和党候选人德怀特·艾森豪威尔于1952年当选总统。他是一位温和派共和党人——记住他是诺曼底登陆的指挥官，北约的负责人——而他的副总统是坚定的反共主义者理查德·尼克松。你们会记得尼克松在阿尔杰·希斯案中的角色。艾森豪威尔是一位政治温和派——他对任何新政或公平施政都不太感兴趣。他是一位共和党人——他喜欢平衡预算，不希望联邦政府过于庞大，但他将允许许多新政项目继续进行。例如，社会保障福利实际上在艾森豪威尔时期得到了扩大。最低工资也将提高。但他在执政期间并没有推行大规模的国内改革计划。

尽管如此，我们历史上规模最大的公共工程项目将在艾森豪威尔政府时期通过，那就是1956年的《州际公路法案》。你们可以在地图上看到根据这项法案进行的所有公路建设。它规定修建42000英里的州际公路，部分理由是国家防御的需要——因此，如果再次发生袭击，这将使人们更容易撤离城市。它产生了巨大的影响：创造了就业机会，导致郊区发展和白人从主要城市迁徙，并且也促进了更标准化的美国文化。随着美国人出行距离城市越来越远，他们想要家里的便利——例如，麦当劳在20世纪50年代诞生了。

理解20世纪50年代社会和经济的变化非常重要，而这个十年实际上可以被定义为经济相当繁荣的时期。美国中产阶级崛起，社会流动性增强，人们的经济地位得以提升。这也是历史上第一次美国白领工人人数超过蓝领工人。出现了一个转变——我们正在成为一个后工业社会。因此，20世纪50年代之后，工会会员人数将下降。

二战后，我们继续看到战后立即出现的情况——向郊区迁移。像莱维敦这样的地方出现了标准化住宅区。重要的是要注意，许多郊区社区不允许非裔美国人购买房屋。当然，20世纪50年代也出现了婴儿潮。

信用卡在20世纪50年代被引入。自20世纪20年代以来一直存在分期付款计划，但现在你们有了可以刷的塑料卡，这促进了消费主义的增长。你们可以购买通常买不起的东西。当然，20世纪50年代最热门的商品是电视，它成为常见的家庭用品。再一次，就像20世纪20年代的广播一样，我们看到了美国文化的某种标准化——人们都在观看相同的内容。

当然，任何时候发生变化，出现文化变革，都会出现紧张局势。事实上，电视的兴起引发了关于国家道德、政治和各种其他问题的质疑，我们今天仍在进行这些辩论。电视美化了郊区生活——你们有像《Leave It to Beaver》和《Father Knows Best》这样的节目，在这些节目中，白人郊区家庭过着完美的小日子，家庭主妇常常受到赞扬。事实上，在这些电视节目中，对家庭主妇的崇拜得到了颂扬和强化。你们可以在这个场景中看到——妈妈待在家里，烤饼干；爸爸去办公室上班。

你们应该了解20世纪50年代的一些紧张局势的例子。例如，在20世纪50年代末，贝蒂·弗里丹写了《女性的奥秘》，这本书严厉批评了美国对女性的待遇和对家庭主妇的崇拜，它实际上被视为现代女权运动的开端。在20世纪60年代，你们将看到这场运动蓬勃发展。

摇滚乐在20世纪50年代兴起。它实际上起源于黑人社区，但像埃尔维斯·普雷斯利这样的人将其带入主流社会。许多老一代人不喜欢埃尔维斯·普雷斯利的表演和他传递给年轻人的信息。你们还有像玛丽莲·梦露这样的人。《花花公子》杂志于20世纪50年代创办——人们挑战这种对家庭主妇的崇拜，并引入性和挑战性规范。

最著名的是，你们有垮掉的一代——垮掉派，垮掉分子——像杰克·凯鲁亚克（他写了《在路上》）、艾伦·金斯堡（以他的诗《嚎叫》而闻名）等人，他们真正批评了20世纪50年代的顺从和消费主义。他们是那个十年的反主流文化。

然而，20世纪50年代的一个重要组成部分是民权运动，重要的是要记住，自从1877年重建结束后，民权问题的进展非常缓慢。我们在南方看到了吉姆·克劳法的形成，而在北方，则存在事实上的歧视。我们不会涵盖所有正在发生的事情，但我们看到了过去几十年中变革的种子。二战——新的民权组织，如CORE，以及全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）成员人数的增加开始推动一些运动。杜鲁门通过他的行政命令解除了军队中的种族隔离，并在他的公平施政下试图提出民权提案。

然而，在20世纪50年代，最重要的时刻是布朗诉教育委员会案。全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）一直试图推翻普莱西诉弗格森案中“隔离但平等”的裁决。他们的律师之一瑟古德·马歇尔和其他人一起将此案提交给最高法院，在布朗案的判决中，法院裁定隔离设施本质上是不平等的。布朗案中，普莱西诉弗格森案被裁定为违宪，法院裁定学校必须“以一切有计划的速度”取消种族隔离。

尽管在布朗案中取得了法律上的胜利，但变革进展缓慢。事实上，南方人的反抗情绪非常强烈。超过100名国会议员签署了《南方宣言》，谴责布朗案最高法院的裁决。他们称该裁决“明显滥用司法权力”。事实上，对抗将在1956-57年发生，当时阿肯色州州长奥维尔·福布斯（有史以来最糟糕的名字）将动用州国民警卫队阻止小石城九人（你们可以在下面看到他们）进入小石城中央高中。

当非裔美国学生试图入学时，暴力暴徒聚集在该地区，电视上南方人反抗的画面迫使艾森豪威尔采取行动。他最终采取了行动，派遣联邦军队护送小石城九人进入中央高中，正如你们在下面看到的那样。奥维尔·福布斯对此不太高兴。但请记住，总统有维护联邦权威的宪法义务。

甚至在此事件之前，民权运动仍在继续。在阿拉巴马州蒙哥马利，罗莎·帕克斯于1955年被捕，引发了著名的蒙哥马利巴士抵制运动。当然，马丁·路德·金作为非暴力运动的领导人崭露头角。金受到甘地和美墨战争时期亨利·大卫·梭罗著作的启发。巴士抵制运动将激励全国其他民权抗议活动。

事实上，20世纪50年代和60年代的民权运动将不断发展壮大。这是一场草根运动——政府最初并没有为民权辩护。你们看到了像南方基督教领袖会议这样的组织——扎根于黑人教堂——它将在民权运动中发挥关键作用，协调不同的行动。

1960年，在北卡罗来纳州格林斯伯勒，大学生在伍尔沃斯一家实行种族隔离的午餐柜台被拒绝服务后，开始了静坐运动——再次使用非暴力策略。普通的民权英雄为创造变革而奋斗。你们将在整个20世纪60年代看到一个重要的组织，那就是学生非暴力协调委员会，它将在协调和组织民权运动中发挥关键作用——从静坐到自由乘车等等。正如我提到的，这些各种草根运动将持续到20世纪60年代，为争取民权而施加压力。

这个十年的另一个关键部分是，冷战将在艾森豪威尔时期继续进行。他的国务卿约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯实际上将挑战遏制战略的思想。他谈到了边缘政策，其背后的思想是击败共产主义并推翻共产主义的成果。也许我们需要解放东欧——挑战共产主义并将其击退，将其推到战争的边缘，他们就会退缩。他们认为遏制政策过于软弱，过于被动。杜勒斯以这个想法而闻名。

他们还谈到了“新面貌”政策，即美国应该加强其核武器库以威慑共产主义的侵略。这部分源于“花小钱办大事”的想法——即发展这些原子武器比传统的军事开支更有效率。这项政策的问题在于，你们无法在较小的冲突中使用这些武器，而且还存在大规模报复的威胁，这使得两个超级大国无法直接对抗。

重要的是要注意，这更多的是一种说辞而非现实。我们实际上并没有试图击败共产主义。艾森豪威尔像杜鲁门一样，尽可能地想避免第三次世界大战。事实上，1953年，艾森豪威尔通过停战协议帮助结束了朝鲜战争，朝鲜仍然以北纬38度线为界分裂。

另一个不愿真正升级冲突的例子是1956年匈牙利革命期间——就在东欧集团内部。艾森豪威尔没有让美国帮助反苏叛乱。匈牙利人反抗并短暂地推翻了苏联的统治，由于没有美国的外部支持，匈牙利革命被苏联镇压了。艾克知道，如果美国试图援助匈牙利叛乱分子，这可能会导致欧洲潜在的战争，而他对此并不感兴趣。

在艾森豪威尔时期，冷战将发生一些变化。事实上，斯大林于1953年意外去世——为那些喜欢这种东西的怪人准备了他的尸体照片——艾森豪威尔呼吁缓和紧张局势并减少军备竞赛。他非常担心这种过度支出和核战争的威胁。他提出了“原子能为和平服务”计划，试图降低全面核战争的可能性。

1955年，一个历史性的时刻发生了，艾森豪威尔在日内瓦会见了苏联领导人。尽管他们没有达成任何明确具体的协议，但两国超级大国之间谈论着一种“日内瓦精神”。这实际上是冷战的第一次解冻——紧张局势的缓和。新的苏联领导人尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫在一篇演讲中谈到了与美国的和平共处。因此，美苏关系出现了一段缓和期。

然而，你们将看到这并不会结束冷战。正如我们所见，匈牙利革命被镇压了。1957年，苏联发射了第一颗人造卫星——斯普特尼克——震惊了美国和世界，这让许多美国人担心我们在技术上落后于苏联，并导致人们呼吁增加联邦支出以改善教育，尤其是在数学和科学领域。因此，《国防教育法》得以通过。美国国家航空航天局（NASA）也于1958年成立，以帮助开发导弹和太空探索等技术。冷战的一个重要组成部分不仅是军备竞赛，也是太空竞赛。

1960年，一架美国U-2侦察机被苏联击落，一名飞行员被俘，这严重打击了这种缓和——紧张局势的缓和。这导致了美苏计划中的峰会被取消。因此，在艾森豪威尔政府时期，紧张局势仍然很高。

你们应该了解的一个非常重要的概念是去殖民化。二战后，殖民帝国的崩溃导致美国和苏联在亚洲、拉丁美洲、非洲和中东等地争夺影响力。你们将看到各种民族主义运动试图争取独立，而美国和苏联将试图将这些地区作为冷战的棋子。这些地区缺乏政治和经济稳定，因此美国和苏联将试图获取影响力。

在艾森豪威尔时期，冷战蔓延到中东地区。人们担心苏联的扩张。事实上，艾森豪威尔将利用中央情报局（CIA）颠覆共产主义政府，或在伊朗和危地马拉等地扶植亲美政权。这种秘密行动成本较低，受到的公众批评也较少，因为人们通常不知道这些行动。例如，1953年，当伊朗试图将外国石油公司国有化（接管）时，中央情报局通过阿贾克斯行动帮助推翻了伊朗的民选政府。中央情报局帮助伊朗国王重新掌权，他是一位非常残酷的独裁者，但他亲美，并给了我们优惠的石油价格，因此我们忽视了他的独裁倾向。这显然导致中东等地出现了很多不满情绪。

中东问题的另一个例子发生在苏伊士运河危机期间——埃及总统，一位名叫纳赛尔的民族主义者，将由法国和英国控制的苏伊士运河国有化。他对运河的接管激怒了法国和英国，并导致英国、法国和以色列袭击埃及。艾森豪威尔非常生气，因为他没有被咨询。他谴责了这次袭击并迫使他们撤兵。然而，重要的是要记住，艾森豪威尔提出了艾森豪威尔主义，这基本上是针对中东的杜鲁门主义。美国承诺向任何受到共产主义威胁的中东国家提供经济和军事援助。重要的是要注意，美国将在中东发挥关键作用，而且我们常常会与那些不民主但不是共产主义的国家结盟。

1960年还发生了一件事，即石油输出国组织（欧佩克）成立——沙特阿拉伯、科威特、伊拉克、伊朗和委内瑞拉等国将试图维持其在石油贸易中的影响力。

在艾森豪威尔时期，你们还将看到冷战蔓延到拉丁美洲。就像在伊朗一样，中央情报局在危地马拉帮助推翻了民选的左翼政府。由于他们是社会主义政府，美国不希望他们掌权。在中央情报局发动的政变之后，一位残酷的独裁者在危地马拉上台。

1959年古巴发生了另一件事。菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导了一场革命，推翻了古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔。卡斯特罗起初并没有与苏联结盟，但他开始将美国拥有的企业国有化，这导致了美国和古巴之间的紧张关系。艾森豪威尔下令对古巴实施禁运——切断贸易——这使得卡斯特罗（字面上）投入了苏联的怀抱。在那里，卡斯特罗和赫鲁晓夫正在热情拥抱。古巴与苏联的关系更加密切。艾森豪威尔政府启动了一项计划，让中央情报局训练古巴流亡者，试图推翻卡斯特罗。我们下次再看看结果如何。

最后，重要的是你们要理解艾森豪威尔在越南冲突中的作用。如果你们点击这两个视频，你们会变得非常聪明，我们将为你们详细讲解。

艾森豪威尔卸任总统时，发表了他的告别演说。在这次演说中，艾森豪威尔警告了军事工业复合体的危险。他担心美国在军备竞赛上花费了太多的钱，这将对美国社会产生负面影响。这是一个至今仍在争论的问题——在国防上花费多少钱。

请记住，在学习本章时，要比较和对比杜鲁门和艾森豪威尔以及其他总统在冷战中的成功和失败。例如，艾克呼吁缓和美苏之间的紧张关系，并启动了首次军备控制努力，与此同时，他还将冷战扩大到中东等新地区，并在伊朗和危地马拉等地利用中央情报局颠覆民选政府。因此，他的遗产是复杂的。

今天就到这里。希望你们学到了很多东西。阻止斯大林并订阅乔的制作。如果这个视频对你们有帮助，请点赞。如果你们有任何问题，请发表评论。祝你们度过美好的一天。再见。

Greetings, everyone. Today we're taking a look at Eisenhower's Administration and the 1950s. We're going to cover you for any APUSH or regular US history textbook, and really you can't understand the 1950s without understanding Eisenhower.

The Republican candidate Dwight Eisenhower was elected in 1952. He is a moderate Republican -- remember him from D-Day, the head of NATO -- and he has with him the hardcore anti-communist Richard Nixon as his vice president. And you'll remember Nixon from the Alger Hiss case. And he's a political moderate -- he's not really interested in any New Deal, Fair Deal. He is a Republican -- he likes balanced budgets, he doesn't want a large federal government, but he's going to let many of the New Deal programs continue on. Such as Social Security benefits are actually going to be extended under Eisenhower. The minimum wage is going to be increased. But he's not pushing a huge domestic reform program during his administration.

In spite of that, the largest public works project ever in our history is going to be adopted under the Eisenhower Administration, and that's the Interstate Highway Act in 1956. And you could see on the map all of the highway construction that takes place under this act. It provides for the building of 42,000 miles of interstate highways, and it's justified partially as necessary for national defense -- so if there is a new attack, this would allow people to evacuate cities much easier. It has huge consequences: it creates jobs, it leads to the growth of the suburbs and white flight from major cities, and it also allows for a more standardized American culture. As Americans are traveling further away from their cities, they want the conveniences of home -- so for example, you get the creation of McDonald's in the 1950s.

It's important to understand the changes in society and the economics of the 1950s, and really the decade can be defined as pretty economically prosperous. There's a rise of the American middle class. There is increased social mobility as people are able to pick up their economic status. And it is the first time in history in which white-collar workers in America outnumber blue-collar workers. There's a transition -- we are becoming a post-industrial society. And as a result, union membership is going to decline following the 1950s.

Post-World War II, we have a continuation of that stuff we saw immediately after the war -- the move to the suburbs. You have the creation of standardized housing in places like Levittown. Important to note that African-Americans were not allowed to purchase homes in many of these suburban neighborhoods. And of course, you have the baby boom going on in the 1950s as well.

Credit cards are introduced in the 1950s. You always had the installment plan since the 1920s, but now you actually have that plastic where you could swipe, and this allows for an increase in consumerism. You could buy things you normally could not afford. And of course, the big hot item in the 1950s is the television, and it becomes a common household item. And once again, just like the radio in the '20s, we have this kind of standardization of American culture -- people are all watching the same thing.

Of course, anytime you have change, you have cultural changes, you're going to have tensions. In fact, the rise of television led to questions regarding the nation's morals and politics and all sorts of other issues, and we continue to have those debates today. Television glamorized the suburban life -- you have shows like "Leave It to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" in which the white suburban family had this perfect little existence, and the woman homemaker is often times celebrated. In fact, the cult of domesticity is celebrated and reinforced in these television shows. As you could see in this scene right here -- mom stays home, bakes cookies; dad goes off to the office.

There are examples of tension in the 1950s you should be aware of. For example, at the end of the decade, Betty Friedan writes "The Feminine Mystique," which is a harsh criticism of America's treatment of women and the cult of domesticity, and it's really seen as the beginning of the modern women's rights movement. And in the '60s, you're going to see this movement explode.

Rock and roll music kind of comes up in the 1950s. It's really out of the black community, but people like Elvis Presley bring it into the mainstream society. And many of the older generation did not like the moves of Elvis Presley and the messages they felt young people were receiving. You also have people like Marilyn Monroe. Playboy magazine was founded in the 1950s -- people challenging this cult of domesticity and bringing sexuality and challenging sexual norms.

And most famously, you have the Beats -- the Beat Generation, the beatniks -- people such as Jack Kerouac who wrote the book "On the Road," Allen Ginsberg famous for his poem "Howl" and others, which really criticize the conformity, the consumerism of the 1950s. And they are the counterculture of the decade.

A big part of the '50s though is the civil rights movement, and it's important to keep in mind that since Reconstruction ended way back in 1877, the issue of civil rights was very slow to progress. We did see the formation of Jim Crow laws throughout the South, and in the North, there was de facto discrimination. We're not going to cover all the things that were happening, but we saw the seeds of change happening over the last couple of decades. World War II -- new civil rights organizations such as CORE and an increase in the membership of the NAACP starts to kind of get some movement going. Truman desegregated the military with his executive order and sought under his Fair Deal to introduce civil rights proposals.

In the 1950s though, the big moment is Brown v. Board of Education. The NAACP had been trying to overturn the Plessy decision of "separate but equal." One of their lawyers, Thurgood Marshall, gets the case along with others to the Supreme Court, and in Brown's decision, they rule -- the court rules -- separate facilities are inherently unequal. Plessy v. Ferguson in the Brown case is ruled unconstitutional, and the court rules that schools must be desegregated with "all deliberate speed."

In spite of this legal victory in the Brown case, change was slow. In fact, Southern defiance was extremely high. Over 100 congressmen signed the Southern Manifesto which condemned the Brown Supreme Court decision. They called the decision "a clear abuse of judicial power." In fact, the showdown is going to occur in 1956-57 where the governor with the worst name ever -- Orville Faubus of Arkansas -- is going to use the state's National Guard to prevent the Little Rock Nine (you see them right below) from attending Little Rock Central High School.

As the African-American students try to attend school, violent mobs congregate in the area, and images on television of Southern defiance pressured Eisenhower to act. And he finally does when he sends federal troops to escort the Little Rock Nine to Central High, as you can see below. Orville Faubus is not too happy about that. But keep in mind, the president has a constitutional duty to uphold federal authority.

Even prior to this event, the civil rights movement was continuing. In Montgomery, Alabama, the arrest of Rosa Parks in 1955 sparks the famous bus boycott in Montgomery. And of course, Martin Luther King rises to prominence as the leader of the nonviolent movement. King is inspired by the work of Gandhi and Henry David Thoreau from the Mexican-American War time period. And the bus boycott will inspire other civil rights protests across the country.

In fact, the civil rights movement in the '50s and into the '60s is going to grow and continue to grow. It's a grassroots movement -- the government is not coming to the defense of civil rights in the beginning. You get groups like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference -- rooted in the black churches -- which is going to play a key role in the civil rights movement coordinating the different actions.

In 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, college students start the sit-in movement after being denied service at a segregated lunch counter at Woolworth's -- once again using the tactic of nonviolence. Ordinary civil rights heroes fighting to create change. And an important organization you're going to see throughout the 1960s is the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which is going to play a key role in coordinating and organizing the civil rights movement -- from the sit-ins to the freedom rides and so on. And as I mentioned, these various grassroots movements are going to pressure for civil rights well into the 1960s.

Another key part of the decade is the fact that the Cold War is going to continue under Eisenhower. And his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, is actually going to challenge the idea of containment. And he talks about brinksmanship, and the idea behind it was to defeat communism and to roll back communist gains. Perhaps we need to liberate Eastern Europe -- challenge communism and push them back, push them to the brink of war, and they would back down. They felt that containment was too weak, too passive of a policy. And Dulles was famous for this idea.

They also talked about the "New Look" policy where the US should build up its nuclear weapons to deter communist aggression. Part of this was this idea of "more bang for the buck" -- that building up these atomic weapons would be more efficient than conventional military spending. The problem with this policy is you can't use these weapons in smaller conflicts, and there's also the threat of massive retaliation which kept the two superpowers from fighting one another directly.

It's important to note that this was more rhetoric than reality. We're not really going to try to defeat communism. Eisenhower, like Truman, wants to avoid World War III whenever possible. In fact, in 1953, Eisenhower helps end the Korean War with an armistice, and Korea remains divided at the 38th parallel.

Another example of not really kind of wanting to escalate the conflict is during the Hungarian Revolution -- right there in the Eastern Bloc in 1956. Eisenhower does not have the US come to the aid of the anti-Soviet rebellions. Hungarians rebel and topple Soviet rule for a brief period, and without outside support from the United States, the Hungarian Revolution is crushed by the Soviet Union. Ike knew that if the US tried to aid the Hungarian rebels, this could lead to a potential war in Europe, and he was not interested in doing this.

There are going to be some changes under Eisenhower with regard to the Cold War. In fact, Stalin unexpectedly dies in 1953 -- there's his dead body for your weirdos that like that kind of thing -- and Eisenhower calls for a relaxation of tensions and a reduction in the arms race. He's really worried about this excessive spending and this threat of nuclear war. He proposes an "Atoms for Peace" plan to try to kind of reduce the likelihood of all-out nuclear war.

And in 1955, a historic moment happens when Eisenhower met with Soviet leaders at Geneva. And although they didn't come up with any firm, concrete agreements, there is this talk of a "spirit of Geneva" amongst the two superpowers. This is really the first thaw of the Cold War -- a relaxation of tensions. The new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in a speech talked about peaceful coexistence with the United States. So there's this kind of period where the US and the Soviet relationship is thawing a bit.

However, you're going to see that this is not going to end the Cold War. As we saw, the Hungarian Revolution is crushed. In 1957, the Soviet Union shocks the US and the world when they launched the first satellite -- Sputnik -- which makes many Americans fear that we were technologically behind the Soviet Union, and it leads to calls for an increase of federal spending to improve education, especially in math and science. So you get the National Defense Education Act passed. You also get NASA created in 1958 to help develop technology such as missiles and space exploration. And a big part of the Cold War is not just an arms race but also a space race.

And a real kind of blow to this kind of détente -- this relaxation of tensions -- occurs in 1960 when a U-2 spy plane -- a US U-2 spy plane -- was shot down by the Soviet Union, and a pilot was taken hostage. And that leads to the cancellation of a planned summit between the US and the Soviet Union. So tensions remain high during Eisenhower's Administration as well.

A really important idea that you should know about is this idea of decolonization. After World War II, the collapse of colonial empires leads to both the US and the Soviet Union competing for influence in places like Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. You're going to have various nationalist movements which are going to try to gain their independence, and the US and the Soviets are going to try to use these areas as pawns of the Cold War. These areas lack political and economic stability, and therefore the US and the Soviets are going to try to gain influence.

Under Eisenhower, the Cold War expands into the Middle East. There's a fear of Soviet expansion. In fact, Eisenhower is going to use the CIA to undermine communist governments or to install pro-US regimes in places like Iran and Guatemala. And this covert action is less expensive and subject to less public criticism because people don't often times know about it. And for example, in 1953, the CIA helps overthrow the elected government of Iran in Operation Ajax when it attempts to nationalize -- to take over -- foreign oil companies. The CIA helps return the Shah of Iran to power, and he is a really brutal dictator, but he's pro-US, and he gives us good oil prices, so we overlook his dictator tendencies. This obviously leads to a lot of resentment in places like the Middle East.

Another example of problems in the Middle East occurs when the Suez Crisis -- the president of Egypt, a nationalist by the name of Nasser, nationalizes the Suez Canal that was controlled by France and England. And his taking over of the canal angers France and England and leads England, France, and Israel to attack Egypt. And Eisenhower is quite angry because he was not consulted. He condemns the attack and forces the withdrawal. Important to keep in mind though is Eisenhower issues the Eisenhower Doctrine, and this is basically the Truman Doctrine for the Middle East. The US promises economic and military aid to any country in the Middle East threatened by communism. And important to note, the US is going to play a key role in the Middle East, and very often we're going to be aligning ourselves with countries that are not democratic as long as they're not communist.

Another thing happens in 1960 when you have the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, and Venezuela -- which are going to try to maintain their leverage in the oil trade.

Under Eisenhower, you're also going to see the Cold War kind of move over into Latin America. Just like in Iran, you have the CIA in Guatemala helping to overthrow the democratically elected leftist government. Since they're a socialist government, the US does not want them in power. And following the CIA coup, a brutal dictator comes to power in Guatemala.

Another event happens in Cuba in 1959. Fidel Castro leads a revolution which removes the Cuban dictator Batista from power. Castro at first is not aligned with the Soviet Union, but he begins to nationalize American-owned businesses, which creates tension between the US and Cuba. And Eisenhower orders an embargo on Cuba -- shuts off trade -- which puts Castro into the arms (literally) of the Soviet Union. There, Castro and Khrushchev are having a hug session. Cuba moves closer to the Soviet Union. The Eisenhower Administration initiates a plan to have the CIA training Cuban exiles to try to overthrow Castro. We'll see how that works out next time.

And finally, it's important you understand what Eisenhower's role was in the Vietnam conflict. And if you click on those two videos, you're going to get super smart, and we're going to break it down for you.

When Eisenhower leaves the presidency, he gives his farewell address. And in this address, Eisenhower warns about the dangers of the military-industrial complex. And his concern was that the US was spending too much money on the arms race, and it would have a negative impact on US society. And it's something that's still debated today -- the amount of money spent on national defense.

Please keep in mind when you're studying this chapter to compare and contrast Cold War success and failures of Truman and Eisenhower and other presidents. For example, Ike called for a relaxation of tensions between the US and the Soviets and initiated the first arms control efforts while at the same time broadening the Cold War to new areas like the Middle East and using the CIA in places like Iran and Guatemala to undermine elected governments. So there's a mixed legacy there.

That's going to do it for today. Hopefully, you learned a whole bunch of stuff. Stop Stalin and subscribe to Joe's Productions. If the video helped you out, click like. If you have any questions, post a comment. And have a beautiful day. Peace.
