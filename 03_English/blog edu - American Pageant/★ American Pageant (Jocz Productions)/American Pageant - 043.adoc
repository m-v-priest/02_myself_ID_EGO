== 释义


What up 怎么了, APUSH people? Today we are going to take a look at 审视 period two in the APUSH curriculum 美国历史进阶先修课程. It goes from 1607 — the founding of Jamestown 詹姆斯敦的建立 — all the way to 1754, which is the beginning of the French and Indian War 法国印第安人战争. And we’re going to knock this out 完成；解决 real quick, give you all the basics 基础知识, just the nitty-gritty 基本事实；关键细节.

So some big ideas 重要观点 for you for period two that you should keep in mind is: one, there were similarities and differences between the Spanish, the French, the English, and Dutch colonization efforts 殖民活动 of North America. These four countries are going to be the four key ones, and there’s going to be similarities and differences between them.

The second point is the English colonies 英国殖民地 were largely allowed to govern their own affairs 管理自己的事务 and often times ignored English mercantile laws 商业法 prior to 在……之前 1754. Historians called this period a period of salutary neglect 有益的忽视. For this period, the colonies are going to be growing, the 13 colonies are going to be establishing themselves 立足；发展, and they’re going to be kind of left alone from England.

Third point: Native Americans 美洲原住民 and Europeans engaged in 参与 a variety of complex relationships 复杂关系. Now isn’t that a vague statement 模糊的表述? We’re going to take a look at that a little bit more closely in a moment.

And then finally, the horrible institution of slavery 奴隶制度 developed in the colonies during this time. So let’s get started.

You know important point: different societies emerge 出现 as Europeans and American Indians maneuvered 巧妙应对 and fought for dominance 统治；主导地位, control, and security in North America. And if you take a look at that map, you have all these different Native American cultures and societies that had been around for a long period of time before contact 接触, and then you have all these European countries coming in. And these countries and the different societies that are going to emerge are going to do so because of the different goals of the Spanish, the French, the English, the Dutch, the different cultures, and then finally the different environments in which they settle 定居. They’re going to inhabit 居住；占据 different parts of the continent, and as a result, the societies are going to be very different and distinct from one another 彼此不同；截然不同.

Another important point is Spain is going to seek to 试图 establish tight control over 对……进行严格控制 the process of colonization in the Western Hemisphere 西半球 and will attempt to convert 使皈依；转变 and exploit the native population 当地人口；原住民. So Spain is going to take over that orangish color 橘色区域, and when it comes to the modern-day United States — you know, Florida into the southwest, Arizona, California — it’s going to be secondary to 在……次要 their empire over here in what is today Mexico and down in Peru and Cuba. That’s where the gold and the silver, the Aztec 阿兹特克人, the Incas 印加人 where they conquered them 征服他们.

Couple of quick things here: remember Columbus comes in 1492, you have the beginnings of the Columbian Exchange 哥伦布大交换. They divide the new world up with the Treaty of Tordesillas 托德西利亚斯条约 between Spain and Portugal. You have some Spanish conquistadors 西班牙征服者 who are running up into different areas of Florida and modern-day Arizona looking for riches and wealth like they found amongst the Incas and the Aztecs. You have the development of the encomienda system 委托监护制 where you basically have native workers who are basically slaves doing the labor 劳动. In 1565, the first permanent European settlement 永久欧洲定居点 in North America is established by Spain with St. Augustine 圣奥古斯丁.

You have Spain governing their empire under mercantilist principles 重商主义原则 — all that gold and silver is being sent back to Spain, the mother country 母国. Spanish missionaries 传教士 are going to play a key role in the settlement of the Spanish Empire, especially New Spain up in the northern part of the frontier region 边境地区, spreading Catholicism 天主教. Spain’s going to have a unique relationship with native people: you are going to have the rise of a mestizo group of people 混血人群 — mixed race people 混血人种 — because there’s going to be intermarriage 通婚 amongst Spanish and native people. And then finally, of course, not everything’s going to go well because in 1680 you’ll have Pueblo Revolt 普韦布洛起义 where the native people in what is today New Mexico will revolt against 反抗 Spanish rule 西班牙统治.

So those are a few things about Spanish colonization 西班牙殖民. What about the French? If you look at the map, France is really doing well — all that green stuff, New France 新法兰西, lot of territory 领土. The Dutch 荷兰人 are also here — if you take a look closely in what is today New York, that purple region was known as New Netherlands 新尼德兰. And France and Dutch are going to share something in common 有共同之处 because relatively few Europeans are going to come over, mainly men, and they’re going to be looking for trade alliances 贸易联盟 with the native people, mainly with regard to 关于 the fur trade 皮毛贸易. And as a result of this — very few people coming over, and most of them being men — intermarriage amongst native people and French and Dutch settlers 定居者 will be much more common than it will be elsewhere in the colonization story.

Couple things about France you should know for a quick study guide: Samuel de Champlain 塞缪尔·德·尚普兰, the father of New France 新法兰西之父, 1608 establishes Quebec 魁北克. You have the French Huguenots 法国胡格诺派 and Catholic Jesuit missionaries 天主教耶稣会传教士 who are coming over, very often trying to convert native people. You have the fur trading economy 皮毛贸易经济, especially beaver fur 海狸皮. And as a result, you have very close relationship with the natives — the Huron alliance 休伦联盟, for instance 例如, or the Algonquin people 阿尔冈昆人. The native tribes 部落 and the French are going to forge this alliance 结成联盟. You know, you have these guys, the coureurs de bois 林间流浪汉 — I totally mispronounce that on purpose 故意读错 — but these are the French fur traders 法国皮毛商人 who are fiercely independent 非常独立, being a part of this colonization process. In terms of government 就政府而言, France isn’t going to have any kind of democratic government principles 民主政府原则 — no trial by jury 陪审团审判, no representative assemblies 代表议会 like you’ll see in the English colonies.

The Dutch — they’re also establishing colonies in what is today New York, Albany, New York area. This is of course run by the Dutch West India Company 荷兰西印度公司. It’s a company town 公司城 — New Amsterdam 新阿姆斯特丹 is the name. And once again, it’s going to be a very diverse colony 多样化的殖民地. For instance, in New Amsterdam in New Netherlands, the majority of the people are not even going to be Dutch. And as a result, it’s going to be very difficult for Holland to keep its colony when English swoops in 突然夺取, I think in like 1664. And keep this in mind: the Beaver Wars 海狸战争 will take place 发生 between the Dutch and their French rivals 对手 — more on that in just a moment.

Now the English colonies were very different from their rivals 对手, especially Spain and France. And the reason for the difference is: one, there’s a large number of men and women who come over. In some cases first it’s men coming over, but slowly women start making up a big percent of the population. They’re going to establish permanent economic settlements 永久性经济定居点, mainly agricultural settlements 农业定居点, whereas the Spanish and the French are moving around much more. Large numbers, permanent settlements. And another key point is a very hostile relationship 敌对关系 with the native people.

Another key point about the British: you are going to have the regional differences 地区差异 existing between the British colonies. And they’re divided up into 被划分为 three kind of categories 类别 — sometimes four. You have the New England colonies 新英格兰殖民地, the northern colonies, the middle colonies in the pinkish color 粉红色区域, and then the southern colonies — sometimes divided up into the Chesapeake 切萨皮克湾地区, whereas Virginia and Maryland 弗吉尼亚和马里兰, and then the Lower South 下南部, South Carolina and Georgia 南卡罗来纳和佐治亚. Reasons for the differences are important that you know: one, who came, you know, depending upon 根据 who came and why they came, this kind of creates different societies. And we’ll take a look at that a little bit more closely in just a second. And finally, environmental and geographic factors 环境和地理因素 — the climate 气候, the natural resources 自然资源 that are available to them. All of these things will cause regional differences 地区差异.

For instance, the New England colonies very much developed based upon who came and the reason they’re coming. The motives 动机 are Puritan 清教徒的, religious motives 宗教动机. You know, you have the Pilgrims 清教徒前辈移民 with the Mayflower Compact 五月花号公约, William Bradford 威廉·布拉德福德 are the first ones in the area. They established the first settlement 定居点, followed by John Winthrop 约翰·温思罗普 and the Massachusetts Bay Company 马萨诸塞湾公司 and his, you know, his goal of a "city upon a hill" 山巅之城. So in the New England region, religion is going to play a key role — close-knit 紧密团结的, homogeneous society 同质化社会, everything’s very similar. You have this religious motives — not everyone was Puritan, but it was the kind of core 核心 of the early period of the New England colonies. You have this scene, of course, in the town hall meetings 市政厅会议 where all adult male churchgoing members 成年男性教友 had a huge amount of power 很大权力. Harvard University 哈佛大学 is established in 1636 as a place to train ministers 牧师 in the colony.

Now however, there is some examples of how this was not exactly a close-knit homogeneous society. For example, Roger Williams 罗杰·威廉姆斯 was banished 驱逐 for his ideas of separation of church and state 政教分离, and eventually he goes off and founds the colony of Rhode Island 罗得岛殖民地. And Anne Hutchinson 安妮·哈钦森 gets into disagreements 产生分歧 with the colonial leadership 殖民当局. You have the Salem witch trials 塞勒姆女巫审判 in 1692 and the Halfway Covenant 中途契约 as more and more of the Puritans were becoming less and less committed to 致力于 the religious mission 宗教使命 of the colony. So these are all great examples of how the colony had to adjust 调整 and was challenged 受到挑战. And then finally, the economy of the New England area is a mixed economy 混合经济 — everything from fishing 捕鱼 to shipbuilding 造船 to wood collection 伐木. So it’s a mixed economy, not a very good spot for big agriculture 大规模农业 because of the cold, rocky climate 寒冷多石的气候.

Another key point: while they’re going there for religious freedom 宗教自由, many of them they are not tolerant of 容忍 people who are different than their own religious beliefs 宗教信仰. So case in point 例如: Roger Williams gets kicked out of the colony.

The middle colonies 中部殖民地 are also a region that’s very unique and distinct 独特的. They are very diverse demographically 人口结构多样化 — there’s a mixture of people coming over. Large number of families in places like Pennsylvania 宾夕法尼亚. There’s also a great degree of religious diversity 宗教多样性 — for instance, the Quakers 贵格会 in Pennsylvania. William Penn 威廉·佩恩, his "holy experiment" 神圣实验 where he is going to give a great degree of religious freedom 宗教自由 to all different religions. Great degree of freedom for women 女性享有很大自由. Ethnic diversity 种族多样性 can be seen, for instance, in New York — you’re going to have the Dutch presence 荷兰人的存在. It is the Dutch who are there first, and then England takes over their colony and renames it New York. You’re going to have a lot of German and Scots-Irish immigrants 德国和苏格兰 - 爱尔兰移民 coming to places like Pennsylvania, immigrating to these colonies. And then finally, the economy is a very mixed economy — a lot of it based upon wheat growing 小麦种植, and it’s going to be referred to as 被称为 the "breadbasket of the colonies" 殖民地的粮仓.

Another area is the Chesapeake Colony 切萨皮克湾殖民地 — we’re dealing with Virginia and Maryland in this case in the Chesapeake Bay region 切萨皮克湾地区, but sometimes North Carolina gets lumped into 被归为 this. If you take a look at Virginia, for example, you will see the economic motives 经济动机 of the colonization of this area. You have people like John Smith 约翰·史密斯, 1607 the establishment of Jamestown 詹姆斯敦的建立. The Virginia Company of London 伦敦弗吉尼亚公司 plays a key role in this. You have this "starving time" 饥荒时期 where the people are struggling — they’re not making any money, they’re not accustomed to working 不习惯工作. John Smith comes in, gives them a lot of discipline 纪律约束, gets them into shape 使他们恢复状态. And then a guy by the name of John Rolfe 约翰·罗尔夫 introduces the cultivation of tobacco 烟草种植, which gives rise to 导致 the plantation economy 种植园经济. And of course at first it is the headright system 人头权制度, indentured servants 契约仆人, but over time because of the various social and political and racial issues 社会、政治和种族问题 going on in the colony, Bacon’s Rebellion 培根起义 happens in 1676, leading to a transition to 转变为 African chattel slavery 非洲动产奴隶制.

In terms of uniqueness 独特性, Maryland’s kind of a unique case study 独特案例 for religion as well as this area. You have Lord Baltimore 巴尔的摩勋爵, and he establishes the colony as a Catholic refuge 天主教避难所 and does pass the Act of Religious Toleration 宗教宽容法案. Of course, this only applies to 适用于 Christians — so if you’re Jewish or Muslim, no toleration for you. But the Chesapeake colonies and North Carolina are going to be characterized by 以……为特征 their cultivation of tobacco and its export 烟草种植和出口.

Finally, the southern colony 南部殖民地 which includes South Carolina — sometimes North Carolina, but kind of more similar to Virginia — and Georgia. And what a lot of people don’t realize also is the fact that you’re dealing with the West Indies 西印度群岛. England had colonies in the West Indies — for instance, Jamaica 牙买加 and Barbados 巴巴多斯. Sugar plantations 甘蔗种植园 are going to be key in that area. Some things about the southern colonies: slave labor 奴隶劳动, cash crop economies 经济作物经济. In South Carolina and Georgia, it’s going to be rice 水稻 and to a lesser extent indigo 靛蓝. But it’s going to be cash crops 经济作物, plantation economy 种植园经济. And in many cases — for instance in South Carolina and in Jamaica, in Barbados — the majority of the population will be slave labor.

Ethnic diversity 种族多样性 of the colonies — things you should know about. You know, for instance, like I just said, South Carolina — there is a mixture of English immigrants and African people in the region. In South Carolina, you have a majority slave population 奴隶人口占多数. Over here in New England with the yellow arrow, you’re going to have a mixture of people — you have Scots-Irish coming in, but once again the majority are going to be Puritans. And then once again in Pennsylvania, you’re going to see that diversity in the colonies — you have the Germans, you have Scots-Irish, you have English. So the colonies are going to be from the start 从一开始 a melting pot 大熔炉 of people, not all English.

In terms of economic diversity 经济多样性, I already mention it, but of course you have the rice production 水稻生产 over here, you have the mixed economy over here in the North, and then in the middle colonies, the breadbasket growing things like wheat and other agricultural products 农产品.

Something that you need to know, and it’s really important that you know about it, is the fact that over time you’re going to get the regional differences diminishing 减少, and these colonies are going to share some colonial identity traits 殖民地身份特征. One of them is there is going to be a development of religious freedom and diversity 宗教自由和多样性. You saw this in some of the colonies already — Rhode Island with Roger Williams establishing the separation of church and state, Pennsylvania, William Penn and the Quakers — this religious toleration 宗教宽容 for all different groups of people. Remember, the Quakers were willing to negotiate 谈判 and buy the land for the native people, whereas that didn’t happen in other colonies. In Maryland, you have this haven 避难所 for Catholics and the Act of Religious Toleration — of course not extended to 扩展到 all religions, just the Christians. And of course, a big moment in colonial identity 殖民地身份认同 is the First Great Awakening 第一次大觉醒 in the 1730s - 40s. You get people like Jonathan Edwards — "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 《愤怒的上帝手中的罪人》, George Whitefield — and this really promotes religious diversity in the colonies. It promotes challenging authority 挑战权威, this kind of democratization of religion 宗教民主化, which is all going to lead to the development of religious freedom and diversity. However, this was not a reality in all of the colonies, so kind of point out when you’re studying where did this occur and where did it not occur. This is the development, not the end, of colonial identity 殖民地认同感.

Politically 政治上, you have the development of democratic institutions 民主制度. For example, in 1620 the Mayflower Compact 五月花号公约 is one of the earliest examples of colonial self-government 殖民地自治. These individuals are signing this document 签署文件 and pledging themselves to 承诺；保证 this greater cause 伟大事业. In the New England colonies, I mentioned it already, but the town hall meetings 市政厅会议 gives a great degree of political power 政治权力 to adult male church members 成年男性教友. In Virginia in 1619, you have the House of Burgesses 弗吉尼亚下议院, which is the first representative assembly 代议制议会 in North America. So of course this is dominated by 由……主导 wealthy rich planters 富有的种植园主, but once again, it is the development of democratic institutions. Pennsylvania — once again, elected representative assemblies 选举产生的代议制议会. Most of the colonies had trial by jury 陪审团审判. And the impact of Enlightenment ideas 启蒙思想的影响 — as ideas from John Locke 约翰·洛克 and Rousseau 卢梭 are coming over to the colonies, this idea of natural rights 自然权利 and other things are taking root 扎根. However, most colonists are excluded from politics 被排除在政治之外. This is the gradual development 逐渐发展 of democratic ideas, so very often white males without property 没有财产的白人男性 are excluded, obviously, and unfortunately African-Americans are excluded, women, Native Americans. So understand the development of democratic institutions.

And then finally, all of the colonies are going to kind of have Anglicization 英国化 of their institutions 制度. They’re going to develop political systems 政治制度 that are based upon English models 英国模式, English legal traditions 英国法律传统, commercial relationship 商业关系 with England, Enlightenment ideas, religious influence 宗教影响, and connections to the Atlantic world 大西洋世界 including the rest of Europe.

Important point: as the colonies developed, their interests often times conflicted with 与……冲突 the goals and interests of the mother country 母国. This led to growing mistrust 日益增长的不信任 between the colonies and England. So during this time, these colonies are developing, but not always are their interests going to align with 与……一致 the interest of England. And of course, kind of a moment of APUSH foreshadowing 美国历史进阶先修课程的伏笔 — things are about to go down 发生；出现问题 in 1754 as the colonies grow and move west in the Ohio Valley 俄亥俄山谷. You’re going to have a conflict with France, which will lead to the French and Indian War.

Early conflict with England — couple things to keep in mind: mercantilist laws 重商主义法律 are going to attempt to restrict 限制 the economic activity 经济活动 of the colonies. Most famously the Navigation Acts 航海条例, which basically say you can only trade with England — you had to go to English ships 英国船只, you had to go to English ports 英国港口, and only some goods are enumerated 列举, meaning only could trade with England. But many colonies are going to ignore these laws by smuggling 走私 and trade with England’s rivals 对手. You’re going to have acts such as the Molasses Act 糖蜜法 and the Hat Act 制帽条例 which put taxes on the colonies 对殖民地征税, and they were intended to promote and protect British economic interest 促进和保护英国经济利益. And very often the colonies are going to be resentful of 对……不满 these. You’re going to have the Dominion of New England 新英格兰自治领 established in 1686, which is going to attempt to increase royal control 加强王室控制 over the colonies — New England colonies, New York, New Jersey. Sir Edmund Andros 埃德蒙·安德罗斯爵士 is going to be put in charge of 负责 this, and ultimately this will fail following the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命. And then last but not least 最后但同样重要的是, as the colonies are moving west into territory that is disputed 有争议的领土 — the Ohio Valley — you are going to have attempts (and this is really in period three) where the English are going to try to stop colonial or restrict colonial expansion 限制殖民地扩张 with the Proclamation of 1763 1763年公告.

All right, a few more things to make you APUSH smart: interactions with European settlers 欧洲定居者 cause tremendous demographic and cultural changes 巨大的人口和文化变化 amongst Native American and African communities 美洲原住民和非洲社区. So this contact that starts in 1492 is going to have huge consequences 巨大影响 for a variety of continents and groups of people. Spain and France tended to attempt to accommodate 适应；容纳 some aspects of Native American culture 美洲原住民文化. So you’re going to have a very different relationship between Spain and France and the Native American communities they interact with 与之互动的美洲原住民社区 than you are going to have with the British.

Which leaves me to point three: English colonization tended to reinforce 加强 their own worldviews 世界观 on land and gender roles 性别角色. So what does all this mean? Well, one, the British American system of slavery 英属美洲奴隶制度 developed out of 源于 the economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics 经济、人口和地理特征 of the British-controlled regions 英国控制地区 of the New World 新大陆. Translation 换句话说: you’re going to have a lack of racial mixing 种族融合缺失 in the English colonies. There’s going to be a very rigid racial hierarchy 严格的种族等级制度 in the British colonies — there’s going to be white British colonists 英国白人殖民者, and there’s going to be African people brought in 被带来的非洲人. Whereas in Spanish colonies, you have the emergence of 出现 mestizo and mulatto people 混血儿. This isn’t going to happen amongst the English colonists. In fact, by 1619, you’re going to have African chattel slavery 非洲动产奴隶制 emerging in the colony of Jamestown and spreading to others. And it is going to be the result of 是……的结果 there being lots of land, a shortage of indentured servants 契约仆人的短缺 to do the work, and the fact that they cannot enslave the native people 奴役原住民 because they’re not immune to 对……没有免疫力 the diseases and they’re able to run away out into the frontier 逃到边疆. And there is the growing demand for European goods or colonial goods 对欧洲商品或殖民地商品的不断增长的需求 which contributes to 促成 this reliance on slavery 对奴隶制的依赖.

There’s also a strong belief in British racial and cultural superiority 英国种族和文化优越性, which leads eventually to 最终导致 the system of slavery to be one in which African people are enslaved for life 终身奴役. This is also going to lead the British colonists to want to get rid of 摆脱 the native people — there is no need for them as there is in the Spanish or the French colonies in North America. And you’re going to have a series of wars 一系列战争 take place as a result. And then finally, African people are going to develop overt and covert ways 公开和隐蔽的方式 of trying to resist 抵抗 the institution of slavery 奴隶制度. Things like running away 逃跑 or working slower 工作懈怠 are all methods that could be utilized 利用.

And here’s the big idea here, and it’s really important — this is lot of stuff about this on the APUSH exam 美国历史进阶先修课程考试: European colonization efforts in North America stimulated intercultural contact 刺激了跨文化接触 and intensified conflict 加剧了冲突 between the various groups of colonizers 殖民者 and native peoples 原住民. So what you’re going to see over and over again 一次又一次看到 is examples of this. For instance 例如, the New England colony — make sure you know about the Pequot War 佩科特战争 in 1636 - 37 where Native Americans are resisting 抵抗 and ultimately defeated 最终被打败. King Philip’s War 菲利普王之战 in the New England colonies, which ends in 1676 and marks 标志着 the kind of final resistance 最后的抵抗 of native people in the New England area. In the Chesapeake colonies, you see the Anglo-Powhatan Wars 英波瓦坦战争 which take place — a series of wars from 1610 to the 1640s where the colonists in Jamestown in Virginia are resisting and warring 与……交战 the native people led by Powhatan 波瓦坦领导的原住民. You have Bacon’s Rebellion 培根起义, which is not as simple as colonizers versus native 殖民者与原住民对抗, but you have the frontiersmen 边疆居民, the backcountry frontiersmen led by Nathaniel Bacon 纳撒尼尔·培根领导的偏远地区边疆居民, rebelling against 反抗 the Tidewater elite 沿海精英, which ultimately leads to the growth of slavery in the colonies.

In the southern colonies in 1739, you have the Stono Rebellion 斯托诺起义 in South Carolina where you have slaves rebelling 奴隶起义, trying to get to Spanish Florida 逃往西班牙佛罗里达, and ultimately it is crushed 被镇压 and further restrictions 进一步限制 are placed on slaves throughout the colonies. In the Spanish colony, you had the Pueblo Revolt 普韦布洛起义 where in 1680 the Pueblo Indians 普韦布洛印第安人 revolt, and after that point the Spanish have to accommodate and relax some of their demands placed upon the native people 放宽对原住民的一些要求 because they’re outnumbered by 数量少于 the native people, unlike in the British colonies. And even in the French and the Dutch colonies, you have the Beaver Wars 海狸战争 in the mid-17th century where you have the French and their native homies 原住民伙伴 fighting the Dutch and their native friends, the Iroquois 易洛魁人. So all of these are examples of intercultural contact and conflict that results 由此产生的跨文化接触和冲突.


In fact, even amongst the Native Americans 美洲原住民，the intensity 强度；剧烈程度 and the destructiveness 破坏性 will increase amongst those groups because they got guns now — the trade 贸易 with the Europeans. There was always intertribal warfare 部落间战争，but it just accelerates 加速；加快. And that could be seen very famously in the Beaver Wars 海狸战争 where you have the Iroquois 易洛魁联盟 fighting the Huron tribe 休伦部落 — traditional rivals 传统对手，but now they got guns from France and the Netherlands 荷兰.
All right, we made it 我们做到了 — period two APUSH 美国历史进阶先修课程第二阶段 reviewed 复习 in about 25 minutes. I hope it was helpful. These are all about the big ideas 重要观点 — go back and study the little stuff 细节内容.

大家好，APUSH的同学们！今天我们来看一下APUSH课程的第二时期。它从1607年——詹姆斯敦的建立——一直到1754年，即法国和印第安人战争的开始。我们将快速过一遍，给你们所有基础知识，只讲重点。

第二时期的一些重要思想，你们应该记住：第一，西班牙、法国、英国和荷兰在北美洲的殖民努力既有相似之处，也有不同之处。这四个国家将是关键的四个，它们之间会有相似之处和不同之处。

第二点是，在1754年之前，英国殖民地在很大程度上被允许管理自己的事务，并且经常忽视英国的重商主义法律。历史学家称这一时期为有益的忽视时期。在此期间，殖民地将发展壮大，13个殖民地将建立起来，它们将在很大程度上被英国放任自流。

第三点：美洲原住民和欧洲人进行了各种复杂的互动。这不是一个含糊的说法吗？我们稍后会更仔细地研究一下。

最后，奴隶制这种可怕的制度在此期间在殖民地发展起来。那么，让我们开始吧。

你们要知道一个重要的点：随着欧洲人和美洲印第安人在北美洲争夺统治权、控制权和安全，不同的社会出现了。如果你们看一下那张地图，你们会看到在接触之前，所有这些不同的美洲原住民文化和社会已经存在了很长时间，然后所有这些欧洲国家都进来了。这些国家和将要出现的不同社会之所以会如此，是因为西班牙、法国、英国、荷兰的不同目标、不同的文化，以及最后它们定居的不同环境。它们将居住在大陆的不同地区，因此，这些社会将彼此非常不同和独特。

另一个重要的点是，西班牙将寻求对西半球的殖民化进程建立严格的控制，并将试图转化和剥削当地居民。因此，西班牙将占据橙色区域，就现代美国而言——你们知道，佛罗里达到西南部，亚利桑那州，加利福尼亚州——它将次于其在今天的墨西哥和秘鲁和古巴的帝国。那里有黄金和白银，阿兹特克人和印加人被他们征服。

这里有几件需要快速了解的事情：记住哥伦布在1492年到来，哥伦布大交换开始了。他们通过托尔德西拉斯条约在西班牙和葡萄牙之间瓜分了新世界。你们有一些西班牙征服者跑到佛罗里达和现代亚利桑那州的不同地区，寻找像他们在印加人和阿兹特克人那里发现的财富。你们有恩科米enda制度的发展，基本上是当地工人基本上是奴隶从事劳动。1565年，西班牙在圣奥古斯丁建立了北美第一个永久性欧洲定居点。

西班牙根据重商主义原则统治其帝国——所有黄金和白银都被送回西班牙，即母国。西班牙传教士将在西班牙帝国的定居中发挥关键作用，尤其是在北部边疆地区的新西班牙，传播天主教。西班牙将与当地人民建立独特的关系：你们将看到麦士蒂索人（混血人）的崛起——因为西班牙人和当地人之间会通婚。当然，最后，并非一切都会顺利，因为在1680年，你们将发生普韦布洛起义，今天新墨西哥州的当地人民将反抗西班牙的统治。

这些是关于西班牙殖民化的一些事情。法国呢？如果你们看一下地图，法国的表现非常好——所有那些绿色区域，新法兰西，大量的领土。荷兰人也在这里——如果你们仔细看一下今天纽约的紫色区域，那里被称为新尼德兰。法国和荷兰将有一些共同之处，因为相对较少的欧洲人会过来，主要是男性，他们将寻求与当地人民的贸易联盟，主要是毛皮贸易。结果——过来的人很少，而且大多数是男性——当地人和法国和荷兰定居者之间的通婚将比殖民化故事中的其他地方更为常见。

关于法国，你们应该了解几件事，作为快速学习指南：新法兰西之父萨缪尔·德·尚普兰于1608年建立了魁北克。你们有法国胡格诺教徒和天主教耶稣会传教士过来，经常试图转化当地人。你们有毛皮贸易经济，尤其是海狸皮。结果，你们与当地人关系非常密切——例如，休伦联盟或阿尔冈昆人。当地部落和法国人将建立这种联盟。你们知道，你们有这些人，森林流浪者——我故意完全发错音——但这些是法国皮货商，他们非常独立，是殖民化进程的一部分。就政府而言，法国没有任何民主政府原则——没有陪审团审判，没有像你们在英国殖民地看到的那样的代议制议会。

荷兰人——他们也在今天纽约、奥尔巴尼、纽约地区建立殖民地。这当然是由荷兰西印度公司经营的。这是一个公司城镇——名为新阿姆斯特丹。再一次，这将是一个非常多元化的殖民地。例如，在新尼德兰的新阿姆斯特丹，大多数人甚至都不是荷兰人。结果，当英国人大约在1664年突然袭击时，荷兰将很难保住其殖民地。记住这一点：海狸战争将发生在荷兰及其法国竞争对手之间——稍后会详细介绍。

现在，英国殖民地与它们的竞争对手，尤其是西班牙和法国，非常不同。造成这种差异的原因是：第一，有大量的男性和女性过来。在某些情况下，最初是男性过来，但慢慢地，女性开始占人口的很大比例。他们将建立永久性的经济定居点，主要是农业定居点，而西班牙人和法国人则更多地四处迁移。人数众多，永久定居点。另一个关键点是与当地人民的敌对关系非常严重。

关于英国人的另一个关键点：你们将看到英国殖民地之间存在着地区差异。它们分为三种——有时是四种——类别。你们有新英格兰殖民地，北部殖民地，粉红色的中部殖民地，然后是南部殖民地——有时分为切萨皮克（弗吉尼亚和马里兰）和下南部（南卡罗来纳和乔治亚）。你们需要了解造成这些差异的重要原因：第一，谁来了，你们知道，取决于谁来以及他们为什么来，这造就了不同的社会。我们稍后会更仔细地研究一下。最后，环境和地理因素——气候，他们可以利用的自然资源。所有这些都会导致地区差异。

例如，新英格兰殖民地的发展很大程度上取决于谁来以及他们来的原因。动机是清教徒的宗教动机。你们知道，你们有五月花号公约的朝圣者，威廉·布拉德福德是该地区的第一批人。他们建立了第一个定居点，随后是约翰·温斯罗普和马萨诸塞湾公司及其“山巅之城”的目标。因此，在新英格兰地区，宗教将发挥关键作用——紧密结合、同质的社会，一切都非常相似。你们有这种宗教动机——并非所有人都是清教徒，但这却是新英格兰殖民地早期阶段的核心。当然，你们看到了镇议会会议的场景，所有成年男性教会成员都拥有巨大的权力。哈佛大学于1636年成立，是殖民地培养牧师的地方。

然而，有一些例子表明这并非完全是一个紧密结合的同质社会。例如，罗杰·威廉姆斯因其政教分离的思想而被驱逐，最终他离开并建立了罗德岛殖民地。安妮·哈钦森与殖民地领导层发生了分歧。你们有1692年的塞勒姆女巫审判和半途契约，因为越来越多的清教徒越来越不致力于殖民地的宗教使命。因此，这些都是殖民地如何调整和受到挑战的绝佳例子。最后，新英格兰地区的经济是混合经济——从渔业到造船到木材采集，应有尽有。因此，这是一个混合经济，由于寒冷多岩石的气候，并不是大规模农业的好地方。

另一个关键点：虽然他们为了宗教自由而来，但他们中的许多人并不容忍与他们自己的宗教信仰不同的人。例如：罗杰·威廉姆斯被逐出殖民地。

中部殖民地也是一个非常独特且与众不同的地区。它们的人口结构非常多样化——有各种各样的人过来。宾夕法尼亚等地区有大量的家庭。宗教多样性也很高——例如，宾夕法尼亚的贵格会教徒。威廉·佩恩的“神圣实验”，他将给予所有不同宗教极大的宗教自由。妇女享有极大的自由。种族多样性可以在纽约看到，例如——你们将看到荷兰人的存在。荷兰人是最初在那里的人，然后英国接管了他们的殖民地并将其更名为纽约。你们将看到许多德国和苏格兰-爱尔兰移民来到宾夕法尼亚等地区，移民到这些殖民地。最后，经济也是非常混合的——很大一部分基于小麦种植，它将被称为“殖民地的粮仓”。

另一个地区是切萨皮克殖民地——在这种情况下，我们处理的是切萨皮克湾地区的弗吉尼亚和马里兰，但有时北卡罗来纳也被归入其中。例如，如果你们看一下弗吉尼亚，你们将看到该地区殖民化的经济动机。你们有约翰·史密斯这样的人，1607年建立了詹姆斯敦。伦敦弗吉尼亚公司在这方面发挥了关键作用。你们经历了“饥饿时期”，人们生活困苦——他们没有赚钱，他们不习惯工作。约翰·史密斯来了，给了他们很多纪律，让他们走上正轨。然后一个名叫约翰·罗尔夫的人引进了烟草种植，这促进了种植园经济的发展。当然，起初是首户制、契约奴，但随着时间的推移，由于殖民地发生的各种社会、政治和种族问题，1676年发生了培根叛乱，导致向非洲奴隶制的过渡。

就独特性而言，马里兰在宗教以及该地区都是一个独特的案例研究。你们有巴尔的摩勋爵，他将该殖民地建立为天主教徒的避难所，并确实通过了宗教宽容法案。当然，这只适用于基督徒——所以如果你是犹太人或穆斯林，你将不会得到宽容。但是切萨皮克殖民地和北卡罗来纳州的特点是种植和出口烟草。

最后是南部殖民地，包括南卡罗来纳州——有时也包括北卡罗来纳州，但它更类似于弗吉尼亚州——和乔治亚州。很多人没有意识到的是，你们也在与西印度群岛打交道。英国在西印度群岛拥有殖民地——例如，牙买加和巴巴多斯。糖种植园将是该地区的关键。关于南部殖民地的一些事情：奴隶劳动，经济作物经济。在南卡罗来纳州和乔治亚州，主要是水稻，其次是靛蓝。但这将是经济作物，种植园经济。在许多情况下——例如在南卡罗来纳州、牙买加和巴巴多斯——大多数人口将是奴隶劳动力。

殖民地的种族多样性——你们应该了解的事情。你们知道，例如，正如我刚才所说，南卡罗来纳州——该地区有英国移民和非洲人的混合。在南卡罗来纳州，奴隶人口占多数。在黄色箭头指向的新英格兰，你们将看到人口的混合——有苏格兰-爱尔兰人进来，但大多数仍然是清教徒。然后在宾夕法尼亚州，你们将再次看到殖民地的多样性——你们有德国人，有苏格兰-爱尔兰人，有英国人。因此，殖民地从一开始就是一个民族的大熔炉，并非全是英国人。

就经济多样性而言，我已经提到了，但当然，你们在这里有水稻生产，在北部有混合经济，而在中部殖民地，这个粮仓种植小麦和其他农产品。

你们需要了解的一件事，而且非常重要，那就是随着时间的推移，地区差异将逐渐缩小，这些殖民地将共享一些共同的殖民地特征。其中之一是宗教自由和多样性的发展。你们已经在一些殖民地看到了这一点——罗德岛的罗杰·威廉姆斯建立了政教分离，宾夕法尼亚州的威廉·佩恩和贵格会教徒——对所有不同群体的人的宗教宽容。记住，贵格会教徒愿意与当地人谈判并购买土地，而在其他殖民地则没有发生这种情况。在马里兰州，你们有天主教徒的避难所和宗教宽容法案——当然，这并不适用于所有宗教，仅限于基督徒。当然，殖民地认同的一个重要时刻是1730年代至1740年代的第一次大觉醒运动。你们有像乔纳森·爱德华兹（《落在愤怒之神手中的罪人》）和乔治·怀特菲尔德这样的人——这真正促进了殖民地的宗教多样性。它促进了挑战权威，这种宗教的民主化，这一切都将导致宗教自由和多样性的发展。然而，这并非所有殖民地的现实，因此在学习时要指出这种情况发生在哪些地方，没有发生在哪些地方。这是殖民地认同的发展，而不是结束。

在政治上，你们看到了民主制度的发展。例如，1620年的《五月花号公约》是殖民地自治的最早例子之一。这些人签署这份文件，并将自己奉献给这个更伟大的事业。在新英格兰殖民地，我已经提到了，但镇议会会议赋予成年男性教会成员极大的政治权力。1619年在弗吉尼亚，你们有了众议院，这是北美第一个代议制议会。当然，这由富有的种植园主主导，但再一次，这是民主制度的发展。宾夕法尼亚州——再一次，选举产生的代议制议会。大多数殖民地都有陪审团审判。启蒙思想的影响——随着约翰·洛克和卢梭的思想传入殖民地，自然权利和其他思想开始扎根。然而，大多数殖民者被排除在政治之外。这是民主思想的逐步发展，因此，通常没有财产的白人男性被排除在外，显然，不幸的是，非裔美国人、妇女和美洲原住民也被排除在外。因此，要理解民主制度的发展。

最后，所有殖民地都将在某种程度上对其机构进行英国化。他们将发展基于英国模式的政治制度、英国法律传统、与英国的商业关系、启蒙思想、宗教影响以及与包括欧洲其他地区在内的整个大西洋世界的联系。

重要的一点：随着殖民地的发展，它们的利益往往与母国的目标和利益相冲突。这导致殖民地和英国之间的不信任感日益增长。因此，在此期间，这些殖民地正在发展，但它们的利益并不总是与英国的利益一致。当然，这有点像是APUSH的伏笔——随着殖民地在俄亥俄河谷发展壮大并向西迁移，1754年将会发生大事。你们将与法国发生冲突，这将导致法国和印第安人战争。

早期与英国的冲突——需要记住几件事：重商主义法律将试图限制殖民地的经济活动。最著名的是《航海法案》，该法案基本上规定你们只能与英国进行贸易——你们必须使用英国的船只，必须前往英国的港口，并且只有一些商品是列举的，这意味着只能与英国进行贸易。但是许多殖民地将通过走私和与英国的竞争对手进行贸易来无视这些法律。你们将看到诸如《糖蜜法案》和《帽子法案》之类的法案，这些法案对殖民地征税，其目的是促进和保护英国的经济利益。殖民地往往会对这些感到不满。你们将在1686年看到新英格兰自治领的建立，这将试图加强王室对殖民地（新英格兰殖民地、纽约、新泽西）的控制。埃德蒙·安德罗斯爵士将被任命负责此事，但最终这将在光荣革命后失败。最后但并非最不重要的一点是，随着殖民地向西迁移到有争议的领土——俄亥俄河谷——你们将看到（这实际上是在第三时期）英国将试图通过1763年的公告阻止或限制殖民地扩张。

好了，还有一些东西能让你们更聪明地应对APUSH：与欧洲殖民者的互动导致美洲原住民和非洲人社区发生巨大的文化和人口结构变化。因此，始于1492年的这种接触将对各个大陆和人群产生巨大的影响。西班牙和法国倾向于试图适应美洲原住民文化的某些方面。因此，西班牙和法国与他们互动的美洲原住民社区之间的关系，将与英国与他们的关系大相径庭。

这让我想到第三点：英国的殖民化倾向于强化他们自己关于土地和性别角色的世界观。这一切意味着什么呢？首先，英国美洲的奴隶制体系是根据新世界英国控制地区的经济、人口和地理特征发展起来的。翻译一下：英国殖民地缺乏种族融合。英国殖民地将存在非常严格的种族等级制度——将有白人英国殖民者，以及被带进来的非洲人。而在西班牙殖民地，你们看到了麦士蒂索人和穆拉托人的出现。这种情况不会发生在英国殖民者之间。事实上，到1619年，非洲奴隶制将在詹姆斯敦殖民地出现并蔓延到其他地方。这是因为土地众多，缺乏契约奴来工作，以及他们无法奴役当地人，因为当地人对疾病没有免疫力，并且能够逃到边疆地区。对欧洲商品或殖民地商品的需求不断增长，也促成了对奴隶制的依赖。

英国人还强烈相信其种族和文化的优越性，这最终导致奴隶制成为一种非洲人终身被奴役的制度。这也将导致英国殖民者想要摆脱当地人——不像在北美洲的西班牙或法国殖民地那样需要他们。结果将发生一系列战争。最后，非洲人将发展公开和隐蔽的方式来抵抗奴隶制。诸如逃跑或放慢工作速度等都是可以利用的方法。

这里有一个重要的观点，而且非常重要——APUSH考试中有很多关于这方面的内容：欧洲在北美洲的殖民努力刺激了跨文化接触，并加剧了各个殖民者和当地人民之间的冲突。你们将一次又一次地看到这方面的例子。例如，新英格兰殖民地——确保你们了解1636-37年的皮科特战争，美洲原住民在那里抵抗并最终被击败。新英格兰殖民地的菲利普国王战争于1676年结束，标志着新英格兰地区当地人民的最后一次抵抗。在切萨皮克殖民地，你们看到了盎格鲁-波瓦坦战争——从1610年到1640年代的一系列战争，弗吉尼亚詹姆斯敦的殖民者在那里抵抗并与由波瓦坦领导的当地人民作战。你们看到了培根叛乱，这不仅仅是殖民者与当地人的简单对抗，而是由纳撒尼尔·培根领导的边疆居民反抗潮水区精英，这最终导致了殖民地奴隶制的增长。

在南部殖民地，1739年，南卡罗来纳州发生了斯托诺叛乱，奴隶在那里反抗，试图逃往西班牙佛罗里达，但最终被镇压，整个殖民地对奴隶的限制进一步加强。在西班牙殖民地，你们发生了普韦布洛起义，1680年普韦布洛印第安人起义，此后，西班牙人不得不迁就并放松对当地人民的一些要求，因为他们的数量不如当地人多，这与英国殖民地不同。甚至在法国和荷兰殖民地，你们在17世纪中期也发生了海狸战争，法国及其当地盟友与荷兰及其当地朋友易洛魁人作战。所有这些都是跨文化接触和冲突的例子。

事实上，即使在美洲原住民之间，由于他们现在拥有了枪支（与欧洲人的贸易），这些群体之间的冲突强度和破坏性也会增加。部落间的战争一直存在，但这只会加速。这在海狸战争中非常明显，易洛魁人与休伦部落作战——传统的竞争对手，但现在他们从法国和荷兰获得了枪支。

好了，我们做到了——大约25分钟回顾了APUSH的第二时期。我希望这有帮助。这些都是关于大的概念——回去学习细节。在今天结束之前，我想向我在洛杉矶的一所第一类学校的所有APUSH学生致以衷心的问候。我们大多数人都是穷人，有些人第一次上AP课程。我们都参加考试，但每年都表现出色，大多数年份的通过率平均超过90%。如果你们加入我们，我们希望你们也能加入这个运动并顺利通过。订阅频道，告诉你们的朋友，继续学习。再见了，各位。

What up, APUSH people? Today we are going to take a look at period two in the APUSH curriculum. It goes from 1607 — the founding of Jamestown — all the way to 1754, which is the beginning of the French and Indian War. And we’re going to knock this out real quick, give you all the basics, just the nitty-gritty.

So some big ideas for you for period two that you should keep in mind is: one, there were similarities and differences between the Spanish, the French, the English, and Dutch colonization efforts of North America. These four countries are going to be the four key ones, and there’s going to be similarities and differences between them.

The second point is the English colonies were largely allowed to govern their own affairs and often times ignored English mercantile laws prior to 1754. Historians called this period a period of salutary neglect. For this period, the colonies are going to be growing, the 13 colonies are going to be establishing themselves, and they’re going to be kind of left alone from England.

Third point: Native Americans and Europeans engaged in a variety of complex relationships. Now isn’t that a vague statement? We’re going to take a look at that a little bit more closely in a moment.

And then finally, the horrible institution of slavery developed in the colonies during this time. So let’s get started.

You know important point: different societies emerge as Europeans and American Indians maneuvered and fought for dominance, control, and security in North America. And if you take a look at that map, you have all these different Native American cultures and societies that had been around for a long period of time before contact, and then you have all these European countries coming in. And these countries and the different societies that are going to emerge are going to do so because of the different goals of the Spanish, the French, the English, the Dutch, the different cultures, and then finally the different environments in which they settle. They’re going to inhabit different parts of the continent, and as a result, the societies are going to be very different and distinct from one another.

Another important point is Spain is going to seek to establish tight control over the process of colonization in the Western Hemisphere and will attempt to convert and exploit the native population. So Spain is going to take over that orangish color, and when it comes to the modern-day United States — you know, Florida into the southwest, Arizona, California — it’s going to be secondary to their empire over here in what is today Mexico and down in Peru and Cuba. That’s where the gold and the silver, the Aztec, the Incas where they conquered them.

Couple of quick things here: remember Columbus comes in 1492, you have the beginnings of the Columbian Exchange. They divide the new world up with the Treaty of Tordesillas between Spain and Portugal. You have some Spanish conquistadors who are running up into different areas of Florida and modern-day Arizona looking for riches and wealth like they found amongst the Incas and the Aztecs. You have the development of the encomienda system where you basically have native workers who are basically slaves doing the labor. In 1565, the first permanent European settlement in North America is established by Spain with St. Augustine.

You have Spain governing their empire under mercantilist principles — all that gold and silver is being sent back to Spain, the mother country. Spanish missionaries are going to play a key role in the settlement of the Spanish Empire, especially New Spain up in the northern part of the frontier region, spreading Catholicism. Spain’s going to have a unique relationship with native people: you are going to have the rise of a mestizo group of people — mixed race people — because there’s going to be intermarriage amongst Spanish and native people. And then finally, of course, not everything’s going to go well because in 1680 you’ll have Pueblo Revolt where the native people in what is today New Mexico will revolt against Spanish rule.

So those are a few things about Spanish colonization. What about the French? If you look at the map, France is really doing well — all that green stuff, New France, lot of territory. The Dutch are also here — if you take a look closely in what is today New York, that purple region was known as New Netherlands. And France and Dutch are going to share something in common because relatively few Europeans are going to come over, mainly men, and they’re going to be looking for trade alliances with the native people, mainly with regard to the fur trade. And as a result of this — very few people coming over, and most of them being men — intermarriage amongst native people and French and Dutch settlers will be much more common than it will be elsewhere in the colonization story.

Couple things about France you should know for a quick study guide: Samuel de Champlain, the father of New France, 1608 establishes Quebec. You have the French Huguenots and Catholic Jesuit missionaries who are coming over, very often trying to convert native people. You have the fur trading economy, especially beaver fur. And as a result, you have very close relationship with the natives — the Huron alliance, for instance, or the Algonquin people. The native tribes and the French are going to forge this alliance. You know, you have these guys, the coureurs de bois — I totally mispronounce that on purpose — but these are the French fur traders who are fiercely independent, being a part of this colonization process. In terms of government, France isn’t going to have any kind of democratic government principles — no trial by jury, no representative assemblies like you’ll see in the English colonies.

The Dutch — they’re also establishing colonies in what is today New York, Albany, New York area. This is of course run by the Dutch West India Company. It’s a company town — New Amsterdam is the name. And once again, it’s going to be a very diverse colony. For instance, in New Amsterdam in New Netherlands, the majority of the people are not even going to be Dutch. And as a result, it’s going to be very difficult for Holland to keep its colony when English swoops in, I think in like 1664. And keep this in mind: the Beaver Wars will take place between the Dutch and their French rivals — more on that in just a moment.

Now the English colonies were very different from their rivals, especially Spain and France. And the reason for the difference is: one, there’s a large number of men and women who come over. In some cases first it’s men coming over, but slowly women start making up a big percent of the population. They’re going to establish permanent economic settlements, mainly agricultural settlements, whereas the Spanish and the French are moving around much more. Large numbers, permanent settlements. And another key point is a very hostile relationship with the native people.

Another key point about the British: you are going to have the regional differences existing between the British colonies. And they’re divided up into three kind of categories — sometimes four. You have the New England colonies, the northern colonies, the middle colonies in the pinkish color, and then the southern colonies — sometimes divided up into the Chesapeake, whereas Virginia and Maryland, and then the Lower South, South Carolina and Georgia. Reasons for the differences are important that you know: one, who came, you know, depending upon who came and why they came, this kind of creates different societies. And we’ll take a look at that a little bit more closely in just a second. And finally, environmental and geographic factors — the climate, the natural resources that are available to them. All of these things will cause regional differences.

For instance, the New England colonies very much developed based upon who came and the reason they’re coming. The motives are Puritan, religious motives. You know, you have the Pilgrims with the Mayflower Compact, William Bradford are the first ones in the area. They established the first settlement, followed by John Winthrop and the Massachusetts Bay Company and his, you know, his goal of a "city upon a hill." So in the New England region, religion is going to play a key role — close-knit, homogeneous society, everything’s very similar. You have this religious motives — not everyone was Puritan, but it was the kind of core of the early period of the New England colonies. You have this scene, of course, in the town hall meetings where all adult male churchgoing members had a huge amount of power. Harvard University is established in 1636 as a place to train ministers in the colony.

Now however, there is some examples of how this was not exactly a close-knit homogeneous society. For example, Roger Williams was banished for his ideas of separation of church and state, and eventually he goes off and founds the colony of Rhode Island. And Anne Hutchinson gets into disagreements with the colonial leadership. You have the Salem witch trials in 1692 and the Halfway Covenant as more and more of the Puritans were becoming less and less committed to the religious mission of the colony. So these are all great examples of how the colony had to adjust and was challenged. And then finally, the economy of the New England area is a mixed economy — everything from fishing to shipbuilding to wood collection. So it’s a mixed economy, not a very good spot for big agriculture because of the cold, rocky climate.

Another key point: while they’re going there for religious freedom, many of them they are not tolerant of people who are different than their own religious beliefs. So case in point: Roger Williams gets kicked out of the colony.

The middle colonies are also a region that’s very unique and distinct. They are very diverse demographically — there’s a mixture of people coming over. Large number of families in places like Pennsylvania. There’s also a great degree of religious diversity — for instance, the Quakers in Pennsylvania. William Penn, his "holy experiment" where he is going to give a great degree of religious freedom to all different religions. Great degree of freedom for women. Ethnic diversity can be seen, for instance, in New York — you’re going to have the Dutch presence. It is the Dutch who are there first, and then England takes over their colony and renames it New York. You’re going to have a lot of German and Scots-Irish immigrants coming to places like Pennsylvania, immigrating to these colonies. And then finally, the economy is a very mixed economy — a lot of it based upon wheat growing, and it’s going to be referred to as the "breadbasket of the colonies."

Another area is the Chesapeake Colony — we’re dealing with Virginia and Maryland in this case in the Chesapeake Bay region, but sometimes North Carolina gets lumped into this. If you take a look at Virginia, for example, you will see the economic motives of the colonization of this area. You have people like John Smith, 1607 the establishment of Jamestown. The Virginia Company of London plays a key role in this. You have this "starving time" where the people are struggling — they’re not making any money, they’re not accustomed to working. John Smith comes in, gives them a lot of discipline, gets them into shape. And then a guy by the name of John Rolfe introduces the cultivation of tobacco, which gives rise to the plantation economy. And of course at first it is the headright system, indentured servants, but over time because of the various social and political and racial issues going on in the colony, Bacon’s Rebellion happens in 1676, leading to a transition to African chattel slavery.

In terms of uniqueness, Maryland’s kind of a unique case study for religion as well as this area. You have Lord Baltimore, and he establishes the colony as a Catholic refuge and does pass the Act of Religious Toleration. Of course, this only applies to Christians — so if you’re Jewish or Muslim, no toleration for you. But the Chesapeake colonies and North Carolina are going to be characterized by their cultivation of tobacco and its export.

Finally, the southern colony which includes South Carolina — sometimes North Carolina, but kind of more similar to Virginia — and Georgia. And what a lot of people don’t realize also is the fact that you’re dealing with the West Indies. England had colonies in the West Indies — for instance, Jamaica and Barbados. Sugar plantations are going to be key in that area. Some things about the southern colonies: slave labor, cash crop economies. In South Carolina and Georgia, it’s going to be rice and to a lesser extent indigo. But it’s going to be cash crops, plantation economy. And in many cases — for instance in South Carolina and in Jamaica, in Barbados — the majority of the population will be slave labor.

Ethnic diversity of the colonies — things you should know about. You know, for instance, like I just said, South Carolina — there is a mixture of English immigrants and African people in the region. In South Carolina, you have a majority slave population. Over here in New England with the yellow arrow, you’re going to have a mixture of people — you have Scots-Irish coming in, but once again the majority are going to be Puritans. And then once again in Pennsylvania, you’re going to see that diversity in the colonies — you have the Germans, you have Scots-Irish, you have English. So the colonies are going to be from the start a melting pot of people, not all English.

In terms of economic diversity, I already mention it, but of course you have the rice production over here, you have the mixed economy over here in the North, and then in the middle colonies, the breadbasket growing things like wheat and other agricultural products.

Something that you need to know, and it’s really important that you know about it, is the fact that over time you’re going to get the regional differences diminishing, and these colonies are going to share some colonial identity traits. One of them is there is going to be a development of religious freedom and diversity. You saw this in some of the colonies already — Rhode Island with Roger Williams establishing the separation of church and state, Pennsylvania, William Penn and the Quakers — this religious toleration for all different groups of people. Remember, the Quakers were willing to negotiate and buy the land for the native people, whereas that didn’t happen in other colonies. In Maryland, you have this haven for Catholics and the Act of Religious Toleration — of course not extended to all religions, just the Christians. And of course, a big moment in colonial identity is the First Great Awakening in the 1730s-40s. You get people like Jonathan Edwards — "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," George Whitefield — and this really promotes religious diversity in the colonies. It promotes challenging authority, this kind of democratization of religion, which is all going to lead to the development of religious freedom and diversity. However, this was not a reality in all of the colonies, so kind of point out when you’re studying where did this occur and where did it not occur. This is the development, not the end, of colonial identity.

Politically, you have the development of democratic institutions. For example, in 1620 the Mayflower Compact is one of the earliest examples of colonial self-government. These individuals are signing this document and pledging themselves to this greater cause. In the New England colonies, I mentioned it already, but the town hall meetings gives a great degree of political power to adult male church members. In Virginia in 1619, you have the House of Burgesses, which is the first representative assembly in North America. So of course this is dominated by wealthy rich planters, but once again, it is the development of democratic institutions. Pennsylvania — once again, elected representative assemblies. Most of the colonies had trial by jury. And the impact of Enlightenment ideas — as ideas from John Locke and Rousseau are coming over to the colonies, this idea of natural rights and other things are taking root. However, most colonists are excluded from politics. This is the gradual development of democratic ideas, so very often white males without property are excluded, obviously, and unfortunately African-Americans are excluded, women, Native Americans. So understand the development of democratic institutions.

And then finally, all of the colonies are going to kind of have Anglicization of their institutions. They’re going to develop political systems that are based upon English models, English legal traditions, commercial relationship with England, Enlightenment ideas, religious influence, and connections to the Atlantic world including the rest of Europe.

Important point: as the colonies developed, their interests often times conflicted with the goals and interests of the mother country. This led to growing mistrust between the colonies and England. So during this time, these colonies are developing, but not always are their interests going to align with the interest of England. And of course, kind of a moment of APUSH foreshadowing — things are about to go down in 1754 as the colonies grow and move west in the Ohio Valley. You’re going to have a conflict with France, which will lead to the French and Indian War.

Early conflict with England — couple things to keep in mind: mercantilist laws are going to attempt to restrict the economic activity of the colonies. Most famously the Navigation Acts, which basically say you can only trade with England — you had to go to English ships, you had to go to English ports, and only some goods are enumerated, meaning only could trade with England. But many colonies are going to ignore these laws by smuggling and trade with England’s rivals. You’re going to have acts such as the Molasses Act and the Hat Act which put taxes on the colonies, and they were intended to promote and protect British economic interest. And very often the colonies are going to be resentful of these. You’re going to have the Dominion of New England established in 1686, which is going to attempt to increase royal control over the colonies — New England colonies, New York, New Jersey. Sir Edmund Andros is going to be put in charge of this, and ultimately this will fail following the Glorious Revolution. And then last but not least, as the colonies are moving west into territory that is disputed — the Ohio Valley — you are going to have attempts (and this is really in period three) where the English are going to try to stop colonial or restrict colonial expansion with the Proclamation of 1763.

All right, a few more things to make you APUSH smart: interactions with European settlers cause tremendous demographic and cultural changes amongst Native American and African communities. So this contact that starts in 1492 is going to have huge consequences for a variety of continents and groups of people. Spain and France tended to attempt to accommodate some aspects of Native American culture. So you’re going to have a very different relationship between Spain and France and the Native American communities they interact with than you are going to have with the British.

Which leaves me to point three: English colonization tended to reinforce their own worldviews on land and gender roles. So what does all this mean? Well, one, the British American system of slavery developed out of the economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics of the British-controlled regions of the New World. Translation: you’re going to have a lack of racial mixing in the English colonies. There’s going to be a very rigid racial hierarchy in the British colonies — there’s going to be white British colonists, and there’s going to be African people brought in. Whereas in Spanish colonies, you have the emergence of mestizo and mulatto people. This isn’t going to happen amongst the English colonists. In fact, by 1619, you’re going to have African chattel slavery emerging in the colony of Jamestown and spreading to others. And it is going to be the result of there being lots of land, a shortage of indentured servants to do the work, and the fact that they cannot enslave the native people because they’re not immune to the diseases and they’re able to run away out into the frontier. And there is the growing demand for European goods or colonial goods which contributes to this reliance on slavery.

There’s also a strong belief in British racial and cultural superiority, which leads eventually to the system of slavery to be one in which African people are enslaved for life. This is also going to lead the British colonists to want to get rid of the native people — there is no need for them as there is in the Spanish or the French colonies in North America. And you’re going to have a series of wars take place as a result. And then finally, African people are going to develop overt and covert ways of trying to resist the institution of slavery. Things like running away or working slower are all methods that could be utilized.

And here’s the big idea here, and it’s really important — this is lot of stuff about this on the APUSH exam: European colonization efforts in North America stimulated intercultural contact and intensified conflict between the various groups of colonizers and native peoples. So what you’re going to see over and over again is examples of this. For instance, the New England colony — make sure you know about the Pequot War in 1636-37 where Native Americans are resisting and ultimately defeated. King Philip’s War in the New England colonies, which ends in 1676 and marks the kind of final resistance of native people in the New England area. In the Chesapeake colonies, you see the Anglo-Powhatan Wars which take place — a series of wars from 1610 to the 1640s where the colonists in Jamestown in Virginia are resisting and warring the native people led by Powhatan. You have Bacon’s Rebellion, which is not as simple as colonizers versus native, but you have the frontiersmen, the backcountry frontiersmen led by Nathaniel Bacon, rebelling against the Tidewater elite, which ultimately leads to the growth of slavery in the colonies.

In the southern colonies in 1739, you have the Stono Rebellion in South Carolina where you have slaves rebelling, trying to get to Spanish Florida, and ultimately it is crushed and further restrictions are placed on slaves throughout the colonies. In the Spanish colony, you had the Pueblo Revolt where in 1680 the Pueblo Indians revolt, and after that point the Spanish have to accommodate and relax some of their demands placed upon the native people because they’re outnumbered by the native people, unlike in the British colonies. And even in the French and the Dutch colonies, you have the Beaver Wars in the mid-17th century where you have the French and their native homies fighting the Dutch and their native friends, the Iroquois. So all of these are examples of intercultural contact and conflict that results.

In fact, even amongst the Native Americans, the intensity and the destructiveness will increase amongst those groups because they got guns now — the trade with the Europeans. There was always intertribal warfare, but it just accelerates. And that could be seen very famously in the Beaver Wars where you have the Iroquois fighting the Huron tribe — traditional rivals, but now they got guns from France and the Netherlands.

All right, we made it — period two APUSH reviewed in about 25 minutes. I hope it was helpful. These are all about the big ideas — go back and study the little stuff. And before we close out today, I want to give a big shout out to all my APUSH students out in Los Angeles at a title one school. Most of us are poor folk, first AP class in some cases. We all take the test, and yet we’re beasting it every single year with an average of over 90% pass rate most years. If you’re joining us, we hope you join the movement and pass as well. And subscribe to the channel, tell your friends, keep on studying. Peace out, y’all.
