== 释义

What's up 怎么了, beautiful people? Today we're gonna take a look at what's in store for you 等着你 if you are taking an AP History exam in the year 2020. If you don't know, AP History modified DBQ rubric 修改后的DBQ评分标准 is coming for you this year. Everything is completely different, and the big difference is you're gonna have 45 minutes for the entire exam -- 45 minutes to write. It is going to be a DBQ 文档分析题, and you'll have five minutes to upload your answer to the College Board platform 大学理事会平台. So it's just one question to define your whole year in your AP history class.

One piece of good news -- the DBQ can cover periods three through seven for AP US history. Pour a little apple juice for all the homies 朋友们. And periods one to eight and nine will not be a part of the DBQ this year. An important number you need to keep in mind is the number ten. Ten is the number of these hot stuff Scott when they did their dance routine 舞蹈套路, and ten is the number of points you can get on the DBQ this year. So it's a modified rubric -- ten points are on it.

The first point is the same as always -- you get one point for a thesis or a claim 论点或主张. And what this is is you respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis 可辩护的论点 or claim that establishes a line of reasoning 推理思路. And so to get this point, you can't just rephrase 改写 the prompt or restate 重申 the prompt -- you've got to take a position. And this is really the strength of your essay -- what are you going to argue? So it's important you get this point.

Next up is contextualization 背景说明. This is the same as it's always been. This is where you describe a broader historical context 更广泛的历史背景 relevant to the prompt. And to earn this point, it must relate to the topic of the prompt to the broader historical events, developments or processes that occur before, during or continue after the timeframe of the question. So usually we say put your contextualization in the opening paragraph right below your thesis statement 论点陈述.

The bulk of 大部分 your points are going to come from the evidence section of the rubric. There are five points here, so you want to score some points in this section. And the first one should be a slam dunk 轻而易举的事 -- this is using the content of at least two documents to address the topic of the prompt. So to get this point, your response must accurately describe rather than simply quote the content from at least two of the documents. So just show that you know what the documents are all about -- you don't even need to connect it to your argument.

The next point that you can get in this section is you support an argument in response to the prompt using two documents. So for this point, you need to take two documents and use the content of the documents to support your argument that you made in your thesis statement. So this is not just describing the documents but using them as evidence 证据, and this one should be pretty easy to get as well. So you want to be able to knock these couple points out from the get-go 从一开始.

This next one may be a little bit more difficult to get -- this is when you support an argument in response to the prompt using at least four documents. So you've got to use four documents -- there're only going to be five documents on the DBQ -- you got to use four of them to advance your argument 推进你的论点. Quick math check -- James K. Polk would point out that that's three of the points so far in the evidence section. So where the other two? This goes to evidence beyond the documents 文档之外的证据. So you got to go and look for this in that big brain of yours -- you got to go and find stuff that's not in the documents.

And you can get one point if you use at least one additional piece of historical evidence beyond that found in the documents that is relevant to an argument about the prompt. So you can't just bring in any kind of random historical fact -- it has to be relevant to the argument you're making. You can get another point if you describe a second piece of outside information 外部信息 -- once again beyond that found in the documents -- and it needs to be relevant to the prompt. So we got five points in the evidence section.

The next section of the rubric is the analysis and reasoning 分析与推理 section. There are three points possible here, and this is where we get our HIPPO points or your HIPPing documents, or if you have a teacher that uses HAPPY like this guy's bright and shiny face -- that's where you get those points. And so one point is awarded for one document you explain how or why the document's point of view 观点, purpose 目的, historical situation 历史情境 or context, and/or audience 受众 is relevant to an argument. So to get this point, your response must explain how or why the different things -- that point of view, the purpose, the historical situation or audience -- is relevant to an argument. So you can't just say the point of view is this -- you've got to link it back to your argument. And then you can get a second point if you do this same process -- the HIPP process or the HAPPY process -- with the second document.

The last part of the rubric is the complexity point 复杂性得分. A lot of teachers call this the Unicorn point 独角兽得分, and this is awarded if you demonstrate a complex understanding 复杂理解 of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt using evidence to corroborate 证实, qualify 限定 or modify 修改 an argument that addresses the question. And so this is looking at the complexities of history -- that nuance 细微差别, the kind of counter-argument 反论点. And this can be awarded if you do this consistently throughout the course of your essay, but it's really difficult to get in a normal year, let alone in a goofy 古怪的 year like 2020.

Now this is a very complex process. Most students, most teachers feel beat up 筋疲力尽 when they're done writing or grading these things, so you need to hang in there 坚持下去. And you know one thing I can't stress enough 再怎么强调都不为过 is knowing your content. You could spend all day looking at this rubric trying to figure it out mathematically, kind of predict what you will score, but if you don't know the history, you can't have an argument and you can't analyze these sources. So content is king 内容为王. Historical thinking skills 历史思维能力 are important, but knowing the stuff is gonna be really important.

And if Theodore Roosevelt can get shot and give a speech with a bullet in him, you can handle this DBQ. And if you need any help, you can go to APUSHExplained.com where there's all sorts of free history and government videos. And most importantly -- stay focused 保持专注, stay strong 保持坚强, stay hungry 保持渴望. You got this 你能行的. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，各位俊男靓女！今天我们要来看看如果你在2020年参加AP历史考试，会遇到什么。如果你不知道，AP历史修改后的DBQ评分标准今年就要来了。一切都完全不同了，最大的不同是整个考试你只有45分钟——45分钟的写作时间。这将是一个DBQ，你将有五分钟的时间将你的答案上传到大学理事会的平台。所以，只有一个问题来定义你在AP历史课上的一整年。

一个好消息是——对于AP美国历史，DBQ可以涵盖第三到第七时期。为所有的好朋友们倒点苹果汁。第一到第八和第九时期今年将不属于DBQ的范围。你需要记住的一个重要数字是十。十是斯科特和他的舞伴跳舞时得到的“热辣”分数，十是你今年在DBQ中可以获得的分数。所以这是一个修改后的评分标准——总共有十分。

第一分和往常一样——你因为提出论点或主张而获得一分。这是指你针对问题提出了一个在历史上站得住脚的论点或主张，并确立了一个论证思路。所以要获得这一分，你不能只是改写或重述问题——你必须采取立场。这实际上是你文章的优势——你打算论证什么？所以获得这一分非常重要。

接下来是背景化。这和以前一样。在这里，你描述了与问题相关的更广泛的历史背景。要获得这一分，它必须将问题的主题与在问题的时间框架之前、期间或之后发生的更广泛的历史事件、发展或过程联系起来。所以通常我们说把你的背景化放在你的论点陈述下面的开篇段落中。

你的大部分分数将来自评分标准的证据部分。这里有五分，所以你希望在这部分获得一些分数。第一个应该是轻而易举的——这是使用至少两个文件的内容来回应问题的主题。所以要获得这一分，你的回答必须准确地描述而不是简单地引用至少两个文件的内容。所以只要表明你知道这些文件是关于什么的——你甚至不需要把它和你的论点联系起来。

你可以在这部分获得的下一个分数是你使用两个文件来支持你对问题的论证。对于这一分，你需要拿出两个文件，并使用这些文件的内容来支持你在你的论点陈述中提出的论证。所以这不仅仅是描述文件，而是将它们用作证据，这一分也应该很容易获得。所以你希望能够从一开始就拿下这两分。

下一个分数可能有点难获得——这是当你使用至少四个文件来支持你对问题的论证时。所以你必须使用四个文件——DBQ上只有五个文件——你必须使用其中的四个来推进你的论证。快速算一下——詹姆斯·K·波尔克会指出，到目前为止，这在证据部分是三分。那么另外两分呢？这涉及到文件以外的证据。所以你必须在你的大脑中寻找这个——你必须找到文件中没有的东西。

如果你使用了至少一条文件中没有的、与你对问题的论证相关的额外历史证据，你可以获得一分。所以你不能随便带入任何历史事实——它必须与你正在提出的论证相关。如果你描述了第二条外部信息——再次是文件中没有的——并且它与问题相关，你可以获得另一分。所以在证据部分我们得到了五分。

评分标准的下一部分是分析和推理部分。这里总共有三分，这就是我们获得HIPPO分数或你的HIPPing文件的地方，或者如果你的老师像这个家伙明亮闪耀的脸一样使用HAPPY——那就是你获得这些分数的地方。所以，解释一个文件如何或为什么该文件的观点、目的、历史背景或情境，和/或受众与一个论证相关，可以获得一分。要获得这一分，你的回答必须解释这些不同的方面——观点、目的、历史背景或受众——如何或为什么与一个论证相关。所以你不能仅仅说观点是这样——你必须把它与你的论证联系起来。如果你对第二个文件做同样的过程——HIPP过程或HAPPY过程——你可以获得第二分。

评分标准的最后一部分是复杂性得分。很多老师称之为“独角兽得分”，如果你展示了对作为问题焦点的历史发展的复杂理解，并使用证据来证实、限定或修改一个回应问题的论证，你就可以获得这一分。所以这考察的是历史的复杂性——细微差别、某种反驳论点。如果你在整篇文章中始终如一地做到这一点，你可以获得这一分，但在正常年份很难获得，更不用说像2020年这样离奇的年份了。

这是一个非常复杂的过程。大多数学生，大多数老师在写完或批改完这些东西后都感到精疲力尽，所以你需要坚持下去。你知道我怎么强调都不为过的一件事是了解你的内容。你可以花一整天看着这个评分标准，试图在数学上弄清楚它，有点预测你将得到的分数，但如果你不了解历史，你就无法提出论点，也无法分析这些来源。所以内容为王。历史思维技能很重要，但了解这些知识将非常重要。

如果西奥多·罗斯福中枪后还能带着子弹发表演讲，你就能应付这个DBQ。如果你需要任何帮助，前往 APUSHExplained.com，那里有各种免费的历史和政府视频。最重要的是——保持专注，保持坚强，保持渴望。你行的。祝你度过美好的一天。再见！
