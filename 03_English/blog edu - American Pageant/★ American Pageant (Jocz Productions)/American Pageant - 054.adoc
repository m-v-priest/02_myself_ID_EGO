What's going down 怎么了, everyone? Thanks for checking out 查看 Joe's Productions. Today we are going to take a look at how to do the redesign long essay question 长论文题 for all the AP History classes. We're going to focus on APUSH, but this will help you out for world or Euro or any AP history class you happen to be taking. This is the most updated video.

So what is the long essay question or the LEQ as they call it on the streets 俗称? It is 15% of the exam. You're going to have 40 minutes to do it, and you will have a choice between three questions. The questions will be pulled from 选自 three different time periods -- those are the time periods the College Board 大学理事会 will choose from -- and the questions may look something like this.

Now here's the deal 情况是这样的 -- you only select one. They give you three questions, and these questions options all deal with the same theme 主题 and assess 评估 the same historical thinking skill 历史思维能力. So in this case on the example you see over there on the right, these questions all deal with continuity and change over time 随时间延续与变化. And this allows you, the student, to choose which time period and historical perspective 历史视角 that you were best prepared to write about. So handle it 好好处理. But it's important to remember you only need to choose one question. Don't try to write three like your boy John Brown. What happened to him?

Really quickly, I want to show you some long essay questions that you may see early on in APUSH. You hear you have a causation question 因果关系题, change in continuity over time question, and a comparison question 比较题. So you may see questions like this about the early periods of American history. And if you check out APUSHExplained.com, it's going to be a slam-dunk 轻而易举的事.

Now what is your favorite number? Because I hope you said six. Big six -- my favorite number is six, and we're going to break down 分解 this rubric 评分标准 point by point. But there are six points total that you can get. Now with that being said, you better get this first point. All right, all right, all right. So that I say all right, all right, all right. In Part A of the rubric is for thesis or claim 论点或主张, and here's how it reads: "Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis 可辩护的论点 or claim that establishes a line of reasoning 推理思路." You better get this point. And I want to highlight this -- the historical defensible and a line of reasoning. So you need to identify what the question is asking -- circle the main task 主要任务, the time period, notes -- start to organize and brainstorm 头脑风暴. Make sure you get all parts of the question. But then you need to take a position or a judgement 判断. You can't just rephrase 改写 the prompt or restate 重申 the prompt.

Now one of the things I'm going to tell you about in just a moment is you might acknowledge the ambiguous nature 模糊性 of history -- the gray area 灰色地带. So you can say, for example, for the most part this is true but there's some contrary evidence 相反证据 that exists as well. Remember history is oftentimes not clear-cut 清晰的, and the more complex your argument, the more points you'll probably get. More on that in a moment.

The second part of the rubric is Part B -- contextualization 背景说明. And it reads: "Describes a broader historical context 更广泛的历史背景 relevant to the prompt." And basically this means you need to provide some historical background 历史背景. Basically you're going to set your essay up -- where are we in history and what's happening around the topic the question is asking about. And if it's way to think about context and contextualization is with the old Star Wars movie crawl 滚动字幕. You know before the movie starts you have the famous crawl that tells you a bunch of stuff about what's happening, and you could see over there on the right all the information you get before the movie actually begins. So contextualization is connecting events to their specific place and time in history. You're providing the background -- you're setting this bad boy up.

Now a couple of things about contextualization to keep in mind -- this cannot be one sentence talking about multiple sentences. So let me give you an example. Here's a comparison question: "Compare and contrast 比较对比 the development of the New England and the Chesapeake colonial regions." Hopefully you know the difference between the New England and the Chesapeake regions. "Analyze the reasons that by 1700s the regions had evolved into two distinct societies 截然不同的社会." So this is a great question, and this is one you'll often times see. So contextualization tip over there -- I've already mentioned it -- that's what you're trying to do. This is what contextualization may look like. You'll notice it is not one sentence. I oftentimes tell my students put it in the first paragraph -- kind of the opening statement 开场白 setting the scene. And then that will get you the point. You're talking about three to four sentences, and eventually the contextualization will lead into the thesis. And there's the thesis tip I've already mentioned, and there is an example of a thesis that is answering this prompt completely. And you'll notice this is divided up into two parts -- the underlying part is that gray area -- that complexity 复杂性 -- that really sets your essay apart from 使...与众不同 many of the others. So this is kind of taking the question and saying yes there were differences, but there were similarities as well. Hit pause if you want to read through this, but if you take a look this would be a great opening paragraph that would get you those first two points, and you can do that once again in that opening paragraph.

Now before we move on, I want to show you a reaction of APUSH teachers when a student writes their LEQ without evidence 证据 to support their thesis statement. So you can't just rewrite the question -- you got to make a claim, but you got to prove it. So where's your evidence? Where's your evidence? On straight and see is the evidence part of a rubric, and there are two points possible in this parts. Point one can be gained by you provide specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. And to earn this point, the response your response must have identified or more specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. So if the topic is about the Chesapeake and the New England colonial development, if you mention things that are relevant to the topic of the prompt -- for example the cultivation of tobacco 烟草种植 in the Chesapeake or John Winthrop's idea of a city upon a hill 山巅之城 -- all of these things are relevant to that topic of that previous question. You would get a point if you do that two or more specific times. However, remember AP -- a lot of people think it stands for Advanced Placement 大学先修课程 -- it really stands for answer the prompt. And to get the target and to get that second point, you need to do the following: support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. So you can get that one point just if it relates to the topic of the prompt, but to get the second point your evidence that you use needs to advance your thesis 推进你的论点. One last thing to note -- in order to get two points, you have to get this one in order to get that one. So you can't just get the one and not the other.

Part D of the rubric is analysis and reasoning 分析与推理. You get one point if you use historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. So this talks about historical reasoning, and this is really another way of talking about skills -- scale, scale, scale -- so your historical thinking skills or reasoning. So remember you're going to have three different questions from three different time periods, but they're all going to address the same historical thinking skill and skill ones in all of them. So it may be comparison, causation, or continuity and change over time. Then we've seen a few examples of each. So Part D of the rubric is evaluating your development of historical region -- are you comparing things correctly, are you talking about why things have stayed the same or changed over time depending upon the question. You'll have to do different things. And then Part D has a second point available, and that goes to this: it demonstrates a complex understanding 复杂理解 of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt using evidence to corroborate 证实, qualify 限定 or modify 修改 an argument that addresses the question. Now what the heck does that mean?

Well it's important to note -- to earn this second point, the response must demonstrate a complex understanding -- that's the key part of this. There's a variety of ways to accomplish this goals, and it's fascinating as you can see those dogs are quite intrigued 被吸引. So for example, explaining both similarity and differences in a comparison question would be a good way of showing that complexity -- not just how things are different but also how they're the same. Remember that example that I gave you earlier comparing New England and the Chesapeake -- that underlying part of the thesis set up that complexity. So not only describing the similarities and the differences but also explaining why. Expanding both continuity and change for a continuity and change type question -- so describing the patterns of this change and the reasons for it. Explaining multiple causes or causes and effects in a causation question -- you know what is the difference between primary causes 主要原因, secondary causes 次要原因, long-term and short-term effects 长期与短期影响. Once again getting into that complexity of history. Explaining nuance 细微差别 of an issue by analyzing multiple variables 多种变量 -- the variety of things that contribute to events. Explaining relevant and insightful connections 有见地的联系 within and across time periods -- so kind of comparing similarities across time. Confirming the validity of an argument 论证有效性 by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes. And qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse and alternative views or evidence. So if you demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical time period or the development, you will get this second point in Part D of the rubric.

So what do we got so far? Six points are possible. Here is the rubric all on one fancy slide for you to take a look at. I just want to remind you there are six points, but you got to make sure you take a position and it's not what you know -- it's what you can prove. Need to be able to prove your argument. Don't break your teacher's heart. If you do not have a thesis, if you do not have evidence, this will be the reaction to your LEQ by your peers and your teacher. But have no fear -- remember we are doing this for America. We will do this. We will rock it 表现出色. We'll get those six points. If you need any help, check out APUSHExplained.com. Thank you for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好！感谢大家观看乔氏制作。今天，我们将探讨如何解答所有AP历史课程的重新设计的长篇论文题（LEQ）。我们将重点关注APUSH（美国历史），但这也会帮助你们学习世界历史、欧洲历史或任何你们正在学习的AP历史课程。这是最新的视频。

那么，长篇论文题，或者街上俗称的LEQ是什么呢？它占考试的15%。你们将有40分钟的时间来完成，并且将在三个问题中选择一个。这些问题将从三个不同的时间段中抽取——这些是大学理事会选择的时间段——问题可能看起来像这样。

现在是重点——你们只能选择一个。他们会给你们三个问题，而这些问题选项都涉及相同的主题，并考察相同的历史思维技能。因此，在右边你们看到的例子中，这些问题都涉及随着时间的推移的连续性和变化。这使得你们学生可以选择你们最准备充分进行写作的时间段和历史视角。所以，好好把握。但重要的是要记住，你们只需要选择一个问题。不要像你们的约翰·布朗那样试图写三个。他怎么了？

我想快速地向你们展示一些你们在APUSH早期可能会看到的LEQ。你们在这里看到了一个因果关系问题、一个随着时间的推移的连续性和变化问题以及一个比较问题。所以你们可能会看到关于美国历史早期的问题，https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E4%BD%A0%E4%BB%AC%E6%9F%A5%E7%9C%8BAPUSHExplained.com，那将是轻而易举的事。

现在，你们最喜欢的数字是什么？因为我希望你们说是六。大六——我最喜欢的数字是六，我们将逐点分析这个评分标准。但你们总共可以得到六分。话虽如此，你们最好拿到这第一分。好，好，好。所以我说好，好，好。评分标准的第一部分A是关于论点或主张的，它的表述如下：“针对问题提出一个在历史上站得住脚的论点或主张，并确立一个论证思路。”你们最好拿到这一分。我想强调这一点——在历史上站得住脚的和论证思路。所以你们需要确定问题在问什么——圈出主要任务、时间段、笔记——开始组织和头脑风暴。确保你们理解问题的各个部分。但然后你们需要采取立场或做出判断。你们不能仅仅改写或重述问题。

我现在要告诉你们的一件事是，你们可以承认历史的模糊性——灰色地带。例如，你们可以说，在大多数情况下这是正确的，但也有一些相反的证据存在。记住，历史往往不是非黑即白的，你们的论证越复杂，你们可能得到的分数就越高。稍后会详细介绍。

评分标准的第二部分是B——背景化。它的表述如下：“描述与问题相关的更广泛的历史背景。”基本上，这意味着你们需要提供一些历史背景。基本上，你们要为你们的文章做铺垫——我们在历史的哪个阶段，围绕问题所询问的主题发生了什么。思考背景和背景化的一个好方法是参考旧的《星球大战》电影的开场字幕。你们知道，在电影开始之前，会有著名的字幕滚动，告诉你们很多正在发生的事情，你们可以在右边看到电影真正开始之前的所有信息。所以，背景化是将事件与历史中特定的地点和时间联系起来。你们在提供背景——你们在为这篇精彩的文章做铺垫。

现在，关于背景化，需要记住几件事——这不能是一句话，而应该是多句话。让我给你们举个例子。这是一个比较问题：“比较和对比新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地区的发展。分析到1700年代，这两个地区演变成两个截然不同的社会的原因。”希望你们知道新英格兰和切萨皮克地区之间的区别。这是一个很好的问题，你们经常会看到这样的问题。那边的背景化提示——我已经提到过了——这就是你们要做的。这就是背景化可能的样子。你们会注意到它不是一句话。我经常告诉我的学生把它放在第一段——有点像开场白，设置场景。然后你们就能拿到这一分。你们要写三到四句话，最终背景化会引出论点。我已经提到了论点提示，这里有一个完全回答这个问题的论点的例子。你们会注意到它分为两部分——下划线部分是灰色地带——那种复杂性——真正使你们的文章与许多其他文章区分开来。所以这有点像接受这个问题，然后说“是的，存在差异，但也有相似之处。”如果你们想仔细阅读，可以暂停视频，但如果你们看一下，这会是一个很棒的开场段落，可以帮助你们获得前两分，而且你们可以在开场段落中再次做到这一点。

在我们继续之前，我想向你们展示一下当学生在LEQ中没有证据支持他们的论点时，APUSH老师的反应。所以你们不能仅仅重写问题——你们必须提出一个主张，但你们必须证明它。所以你们的证据在哪里？你们的证据在哪里？评分标准的C部分是证据部分，这部分总共有两分。第一分可以通过你们提供与问题主题相关的具体证据例子来获得。要获得这一分，你们的回答必须确定两个或更多与问题主题相关的具体历史证据例子。所以如果主题是关于切萨皮克和新英格兰殖民地的发展，如果你们提到与问题主题相关的事情——例如切萨皮克地区的烟草种植或约翰·温思罗普的“山巅之城”的想法——所有这些都与之前问题的那个主题相关。如果你们做了两次或更多具体的相关论述，你们就能获得一分。然而，记住AP——很多人认为它代表“高级课程”（Advanced Placement）——它实际上代表“回答问题”（Answer the Prompt）。要达到目标并获得第二分，你们需要做到以下几点：使用具体且相关的证据例子来支持你们对问题的论证。所以，如果你们的证据与问题的主题相关，你们就能获得一分，但要获得第二分，你们使用的证据需要推进你们的论点。最后一点需要注意的是——要获得两分，你们必须先获得第一分才能获得第二分。所以你们不能只获得其中一分。

评分标准的D部分是分析和推理。如果你们使用历史推理来构建或组织一个论证以回应问题，你们将获得一分。这部分谈论的是历史推理，实际上是另一种谈论技能的方式——规模、规模、规模——所以是你们的历史思维技能或推理能力。记住，你们将有三个来自三个不同时期的不同问题，但它们都将考察相同的历史思维技能和第一类技能。所以可能是比较、因果关系或随着时间的推移的连续性和变化。我们已经看到了每种技能的几个例子。所以评分标准的D部分是评估你们对历史区域发展的分析——你们是否正确地比较事物，你们是否根据问题讨论了事物保持不变或随着时间推移而变化的原因。你们将需要做不同的事情。然后，D部分还有第二分可以获得，它指向以下内容：它展示了对作为问题焦点的历史发展的复杂理解，使用证据来证实、限定或修改一个回应问题的论证。这到底是什么意思？

重要的是要注意——要获得这第二分，回答必须展示出复杂的理解——这是关键部分。有很多方法可以实现这个目标，正如你们所见，那些狗狗们非常好奇，这很有趣。例如，在比较问题中解释相似之处和不同之处将是展示这种复杂性的一个好方法——不仅仅是事物如何不同，还要说明它们如何相同。记住我之前给你们的比较新英格兰和切萨皮克的例子——论点中下划线的部分就体现了这种复杂性。所以不仅要描述相似之处和不同之处，还要解释原因。对于连续性和变化类型的问题，要同时扩展连续性和变化——描述这种变化的模式及其原因。在因果关系问题中解释多种原因或原因和结果——你们知道主要原因、次要原因、长期影响和短期影响之间的区别是什么。再次深入探讨历史的复杂性。通过分析多个变量来解释问题的细微差别——导致事件发生的各种因素。解释时间段内部和跨时间段的相关且深刻的联系——所以有点像跨时间比较相似之处。通过跨主题证实多个视角来确认论证的有效性。并通过考虑不同的和替代的观点或证据来限定或修改论证。所以，如果你们展示了对历史时期或发展的复杂理解，你们将在评分标准的D部分获得这第二分。

所以我们目前得到了什么？总共有六分可以获得。这里有一个精美的幻灯片，上面列出了所有的评分标准供你们参考。我只想提醒你们，总共有六分，但你们必须确保你们采取立场，这不仅仅是你们知道什么——而是你们能证明什么。需要能够证明你们的论点。不要伤你们老师的心。如果你们没有论点，如果你们没有证据，你们的同学和老师会对你们的LEQ做出这样的反应。但不要害怕——记住我们是为了美国而这样做。我们会做到这一点。我们会做得很好。我们会拿到那六分。如果你们需要任何帮助， 请查看APUSHExplained.com。感谢你们的观看。祝你们度过美好的一天。再见！

But it's important to remember you only need to choose one question. Don't try to write three like your boy John Brown. What happened to him?

Expanding both continuity and change for a continuity and change type question -- so describing the patterns of this change and the reasons for it. Explaining multiple causes or causes and effects in a causation question -- you know what is the difference between primary causes, secondary causes, long-term and short-term effects. Once again getting into that complexity of history. Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables -- the variety of things that contribute to events. Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across time periods -- so kind of comparing similarities across time. Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes. And qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse and alternative views or evidence. So if you demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical time period or the development, you will get this second point in Part D of the rubric.

So what do we got so far? Six points are possible. Here is the rubric all on one fancy slide for you to take a look at. I just want to remind you there are six points, but you got to make sure you take a position and it's not what you know -- it's what you can prove. Need to be able to prove your argument. Don't break your teacher's heart. If you do not have a thesis, if you do not have evidence, this will be the reaction to your LEQ by your peers and your teacher. But have no fear -- remember we are doing this for America. We will do this. We will rock it. We'll get those six points. If you need any help, check out APUSHExplained.com. Thank you for watching.
