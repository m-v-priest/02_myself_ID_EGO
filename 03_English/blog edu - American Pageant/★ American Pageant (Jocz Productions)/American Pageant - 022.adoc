== 释义

We are back, APUSH homeboys and homegirls. + 
 Today we're going to take a look at Gilded Age 镀金时代 politics, roughly from 1868 to the 1890s. + 
 And in 1868, there's an election, and President Grant - the Civil War General Grant - wins the presidency 总统职位；总统任期 for the Republican Party in 1868. + 
 This guy has no real political experience, but he was a hero, so he wins the presidency. + 
 And really, a big part of his victory comes from the fact that there was a temporary 暂时的 social and political revolution going on in the South during Reconstruction when black voters were able to vote for the first time. + 
 And those black voters are voting for the Republican candidates, and the freedmen 被解放的奴隶 give the Republican Party a huge boost 推动；促进. + 


Now the problem for Grant is there's going to be a lot of corruption 腐败；贪污 during his administration 政府；行政部门, and it's really the people around him that are the kind of key culprits 罪犯；造成破坏的事物 in this corruption. + 
 There's an event called the Credit Mobilier Affair 美孚信贷公司丑闻 where his vice president and members of Congress are involved in the sale of railroad stock 铁路股票, and it's a whole scandal 丑闻；丑事 there where they're personally enriching 使富裕 themselves. + 
 You have the Whiskey Ring 威士忌酒帮 in 1875 where Grant's private secretary is found to be stealing $3 million from the federal government in a tax corruption scheme 税务腐败计划. + 
 And there's many other examples of this corruption. + 
 In fact, the term "Grantism" is a term that was used to describe corruption in politics. + 
 So Grant's going to have a hard time as president. + 


Now the ultimate 最终的；最后的 symbol 象征 of Gilded Age political corruption could be seen in Boss Tweed. + 
 And this is local political corruption because in a place in New York City, there was a political machine 政治集团 run by the Democratic Party called Tammany Hall 坦慕尼协会. + 
 And the boss of that political party was that guy right there - Boss Tweed. + 
 And he's going to use bribery 行贿；受贿, graft 贪污；受贿, and fraud 欺诈；诈骗 to steal over $200 million from New York taxpayers 纳税人. + 
 And really, he is and Tammany Hall itself is the symbol of this corruption. + 
 And unfortunately for Boss Tweed, Thomas Nast, a political cartoonist 政治漫画家, will ultimately expose 揭露 this corruption to the masses 群众 as you see in that political cartoon right there. + 


Now something bad happens in 1873 - there's a panic 恐慌. + 
 And the Panic of 1873 really kind of hurts the entire economy because it's a severe 严重的 economic collapse 崩溃 that further distracts 使分心；转移注意力 the nation from enforcing Reconstruction. + 
 And so there's this huge panic - banks are failing, huge amount of unemployment, businesses failing as well. + 
 And there's some causes here that are revealing that the economy is not healthy. + 
 One is overproduction 生产过剩 in industries such as factories, railroad, and mining. + 
 And over-speculation 过度投机 by bankers - they were giving out too much money that couldn't be paid back. + 
 And this panic lasts for a number of years, and the hard times are going to be inflicted 使遭受（打击）；施加（伤害） worst on the debtors 债务人 and farmers and people in those categories 类别. + 


And this brings up a debate 辩论 over monetary policies 货币政策. + 
 Debtors advocate for 倡导；支持 relaxation 放松 of tight money policies where there is a restriction 限制 to the access to easy money. + 
 And the debate comes down to those who favor hard currency 硬通货 - gold and silver - versus 与……相比 paper money or soft currency 软通货 such as greenbacks 绿背纸币. + 
 And ultimately, it is going to be a debate that's going to reemerge 再次出现 especially in the 1890s when farmers, the agrarian sector 农业部门, and other debtor groups want cheap money - they want greenbacks issued 发行, they want to make it rain （俚语：大量撒钱；提供大量资金）. + 


Well after two terms 任期 as president, there's another election, and this is the election of 1876. + 
 Grant's gone. + 
 The Republicans turn to Rutherford B.  Hayes, and he's running against the Democrat Samuel Tilden. +
 And this election is a very important election because there is a political controversy 争议. + 
 Three of the states' returns 选举结果 are contested 有争议的, and they all happen to be in Southern states. + 
 And there's a big controversy as to whether or not it's going to be the Republican guy Hayes or the Democrat Tilden to take the White House 白宫（代指美国总统职位）. + 
 And ultimately, a compromise 妥协 is reached called the Compromise of 1877. + 


And in this compromise, a couple things happen. + 
 One, the South and Democrats will recognize the Republican Rutherford B. + 
 Hayes - he will become the president of the United States. + 
 In exchange for 作为……的交换 them recognizing Hayes' presidency, he would agree to pull out 撤出 the last federal troops from the South and formally 正式地 end Reconstruction. + 
 It was already kind of slowing down - there were only federal troops in about two or three Southern states - but he's going to pull them out and formally end the Reconstruction process. + 
 And then finally, Hayes, the Republicans need to provide the South with political positions, patronage 政治庇护；官职任命, and federal aid 联邦援助 for the building of a transcontinental railroad 横贯大陆的铁路 for the South through Texas. + 


And important to keep in mind is this Compromise of 1877 is the formal end of Reconstruction. + 
 And as the federal troops are withdrawn 撤回 - those troops which were protecting African-Americans and the Republican governments - they are withdrawn and Reconstruction is abandoned 放弃. + 


Now it's not just the federal troops leaving which ends Reconstruction. + 
 The courts also undermined 破坏；削弱 it. + 
 Little review here - remember the Civil Rights Act of 1875? This protected rights, and in this act of 1875, it made it a crime 犯罪行为 for any individual to deny full and equal use of public places 公共场所. + 
 It also prohibited 禁止 racial discrimination 种族歧视 in jury selection 陪审团挑选. + 
 So this Civil Rights Act of 1875 was designed to protect the rights of African-Americans. + 
 And in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883, the courts strike that law down 废除；取消. + 
 In these cases, the Supreme Court 最高法院 says the 14th Amendment only protected against government violations 侵犯 of civil rights. + 
 Translation 解释：individuals can discriminate all they want. + 
 So if railroad companies or hotels or other businesses would like to discriminate, they have the right to do so. + 
 Therefore, the Civil Rights Act of 1875 is overturned 推翻. + 


And what's important to keep in mind is as Reconstruction is abandoned, Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法 are going to spread throughout the South. + 
 And the courts' decisions are going to support segregation laws 种族隔离法 throughout the South. + 
 And very important is Plessy v. + 
 Ferguson in 1896. + 
 And in this case, the Supreme Court rules 裁决 racial segregation 种族隔离 was constitutional 合宪的 if equal facilities 设施 were made available to each race. + 
 And this establishes the "separate but equal" doctrine 原则；学说. + 
 And we all hopefully know it was always separate but never equal. + 
 And so you get Jim Crow laws spreading segregation throughout the South, and it is validated 证实；确认 and approved by the courts. + 


And another thing you should keep in mind is this idea of the New South in the Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction era 时代. + 
 This idea was promoted 宣传；推广 especially by Southerners - a few Southerners - that the South would rebuild, it would industrialize 工业化, and they would develop their economy. + 
 But the reality is in spite of 尽管 these calls for this New South, yes, there's a rise in textile factories 纺织厂 in the South, the South is going to largely remain agrarian 农业的. + 
 Sharecropping 佃农制 and tenant farming 租佃制 is going to continue to be the dominant 占主导地位的 economic activity. + 
 And life for African-Americans in the post-Reconstruction South is going to continue to be filled with many challenges. + 


Let me give you a couple of examples. + 
 15th Amendment 修正案, if you recall, gave black men the right to vote - not women - and this was a big controversy. + 
 And slowly, you see the systematic 有系统的；蓄意的 disenfranchisement 剥夺选举权 of Southern blacks. + 
 And this was done in a number of ways. + 
 And you could see violence and intimidation 恐吓；威胁 was one, but also things like literacy tests 识字测试, poll taxes 人头税, property requirements 财产要求 were designed to disenfranchise African-American voters. + 
 They also established grandfather clauses 祖父条款 which exempted 免除 from electoral requirements 选举要求 anyone who had voted in the election of 1860 or prior 之前的 - which meant white people did not have to fulfill 履行 these electoral requirements. + 


And what you see - if you recall that temporary social and political revolution where Republicans and black voters were winning Southern states - that's going to quickly fall apart 瓦解 after Reconstruction ends. + 
 And Democrats are going to dominate 主导；控制 the South. + 
 White Democratic governments - the so-called Redeemers （美国重建时期的）民主党保守派 - are reassuming 重新掌握 political power throughout the South. + 


One other thing that's happening during this time period - kind of outside of Reconstruction - is a huge increase, a large increase in Asian immigration 移民, especially from China. + 
 And Chinese immigrants, especially Chinese men, are going to play a huge role in the mining booms 矿业繁荣 - you can see Chinese miners at that bottom photo - and in the building of the railroads. + 
 And after those kind of economic boom and bust cycles 兴衰周期 take place, Chinese immigrants are going to spread out throughout the West. + 
 But there's going to be a spike 激增 in nativism 本土主义 towards Asian immigrants, especially in the West where their populations were larger. + 
 And as a result of this, you're going to get a very important law - the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 1882年排华法案, which prohibited further immigration of Chinese laborers 劳工 to the United States. + 


And this is a hugely important law because it's the first time immigration restrictions 移民限制 were put in place on the basis of 基于 race and nationality 国籍. + 
 And what you see in the Chinese Exclusion Act is a national policy 国家政策 of discrimination 歧视 towards Chinese immigrants because of race. + 


Real quickly, we're going to take a look at the Gilded Age presidents, and you don't need to memorize 记住 these guys. + 
 In fact, very often they're kind of jokingly referred to as the forgotten presidents. + 
 They are the ones with the worst names ever - Rutherford, Garfield, Chester, Grover, and so on. + 
 But you could see, you know, you have Republicans, you have Democrats serving in office 任职. + 
 And the Gilded Age - it's important you keep in mind - it's this post-Civil War, post-Reconstruction era of rapid economic and population growth. + 
 And that term Gilded Age was coined 创造；杜撰 by Mark Twain, and he used it as a sarcastic 讽刺的 term to criticize this era. + 
 And in this lecture, we're only going to take a look at the political aspects 方面 of the Gilded Age. + 


And one of the key things you need to keep in mind directly from the APUSH curriculum 课程 is Gilded Age politics were intimately 紧密地 tied to big business and focused nationally on economic issues such as tariffs 关税 and currency policy 货币政策 - real sexy and exciting stuff, I know. + 
 Both political parties during the Gilded Age are going to ignore the political and social consequences 后果 of industrialization 工业化. + 
 So the rise of poverty and bad working conditions are going to be ignored by the Republicans and Democrats because there's going to be a belief in this idea of laissez-faire 自由放任 - to leave things alone. + 
 The government should not regulate 监管 or monitor 监督 society. + 
 And it's important you keep in mind no matter which president we're looking at, they are largely going to pursue 奉行；推行 a pro-business policy 亲商政策. + 


And we've already seen one example with the currency issue favoring the kind of hard money - gold or silver. + 
 But one other issue that we're going to look at that becomes an issue in national politics is civil service reform 公务员制度改革 and tariffs. + 
 Patronage 政治庇护；官职任命 was used by both political parties, and that all goes down to this idea that civil service jobs were given to supporters - you know, "to the victor belongs the spoils 战利品；胜利果实"（胜者为王；赢者通吃）. + 
 We saw the spoils system 分赃制 talked about during the Jackson lecture. + 
 And there was growing criticism 批评 and calls for reform of the civil service. + 
 There was this perception 看法；认识 that these people were very often corrupt and did not know what they were doing, and the only reason they got the job was because of loyalty 忠诚. + 
 And so there were calls for people to reform that. + 


Another thing that you need to kind of keep in mind is that you have two camps 阵营 within the political parties. + 
 One - Half-Breeds 半血统派 - advocated civil service reform, and their leader is James Blaine. + 
 And the other group was the Stalwarts 坚定派, and these were supporters of patronage, and they're best represented by Roscoe Conkling. + 


Tariffs was also an issue that you need to keep in mind for Gilded Age politics. + 
 And a big thing that was happening is by the 1880s, the U. S. Treasury 美国财政部 had a huge surplus 盈余 from tariffs - there was a lot of money. +
 And people - you see Grover Cleveland, the Democrats, and farmers and others - wanted to cut those tariffs down and lower those tariffs. + 
 And that's going to be a big issue during this period. + 


A couple key things to keep in mind: Hayes - Rutherford B.  Hayes - he's the guy who gets elected in the disputed 有争议的 election, and the Compromise of 1877 settles 解决 that. +
 He does send federal troops to break up 驱散 the Great Railroad Strike 大铁路罢工 - sending in the federal troops to break up a labor union 工会, and we'll learn a little bit more about that in another video. + 
 James Garfield - he's elected, he's also a Republican, he's assassinated 暗杀, and his VP Chester Arthur takes over. + 
 And he supports - surprisingly, since he is a Stalwart - the Pendleton Act 彭德尔顿法, which establishes civil service reform. + 
 And it establishes the Civil Service Commission 公务员委员会 so that people to get federal jobs had to take a competitive exam 竞争性考试 to prove that they were capable of doing the job. + 


Grover Cleveland - the Democrats regain 重新获得 the White House in 1884 in the election of 1884. + 
 He is a strong advocate of laissez-faire - most of these guys are. + 
 His famous quote: "Though the people support the government, the government should not support the people."  +
He does sign into law the Interstate Commerce Act 州际商业法, which we'll take a look at in another chapter. +
 And then the Republicans regain the White House with Benjamin Harrison - the grandson of the former president. + 
 He advocates for keeping the tariff high. + 
 In fact, during his presidency, there's going to be this so-called "Billion Dollar Congress" 十亿美元国会, and they in 1890 are going to pass the McKinley Tariff 麦金利关税法 - one of the highest tariffs in American history - and also increase the Civil War pensions 养老金. + 


And then of course, for the first and only time in American history, a president will come back into the White House to serve a non-consecutive 不连续的 second term. + 
 And we'll take a look at a little bit more about what happens during this time period in other videos. + 


That's going to do it for today. + 
 I hope you found Gilded Age politics exciting - it's my least favorite topic in American history. + 
 But if you have any questions, you can always post a comment, click like on the video if you haven't done so, subscribe, tell some friends to do the same, and get a five on that exam, people. + 
 APUSH beast mode. + 
 Peace. +

我们回来了，各位APUSH的兄弟姐妹们。今天我们要来看一看美国历史上被称为镀金时代的政治，大致是从1868年到1890年代。1868年举行了一次选举，格兰特总统——内战时期的格兰特将军——在1868年为共和党赢得了总统职位。这个人没有任何真正的政治经验，但他是一位英雄，所以他赢得了总统职位。实际上，他胜利的一个重要原因是，在重建时期，南方正在发生一场暂时的社会和政治革命，当时黑人选民第一次能够投票。而这些黑人选民正在投票给共和党候选人，自由民给了共和党巨大的推动。

现在格兰特的问题是，在他的执政期间将会出现大量的腐败，而真正造成这种腐败的关键人物是他周围的人。发生了一件叫做“信贷移动公司丑闻”的事件，他的副总统和国会议员都参与了铁路股票的出售，这是一场涉及他们个人敛财的巨大丑闻。1875年发生了“威士忌团伙”事件，格兰特的私人秘书被发现通过税务腐败计划从联邦政府窃取了300万美元。还有许多其他这样的腐败例子。事实上，“格兰特主义”这个词被用来形容政治腐败。所以格兰特作为总统将面临艰难的时期。

镀金时代政治腐败的终极象征可以在“老爹”特威德身上看到。这是地方政治腐败，因为在纽约市，有一个由民主党控制的政治机器，叫做坦慕尼协会。那个政党的头目就是那个人——“老爹”特威德。他将利用贿赂、贪污和欺诈从纽约纳税人手中窃取超过2亿美元。实际上，他和坦慕尼协会本身就是这种腐败的象征。不幸的是，“老爹”特威德，政治漫画家托马斯·纳斯特最终将通过你们在那张政治漫画中看到的那样，向大众揭露这种腐败。

1873年发生了一件坏事——发生了恐慌。1873年恐慌实际上严重损害了整个经济，因为它是一场严重的经济崩溃，进一步分散了国家执行重建的注意力。因此出现了巨大的恐慌——银行倒闭，失业人数巨大，企业也纷纷倒闭。这里有一些揭示经济不健康的根本原因。一是工厂、铁路和采矿等行业的生产过剩。二是银行家的过度投机——他们发放了太多无法偿还的贷款。这场恐慌持续了几年，而最艰难的时期将降临到债务人、农民和这类人群身上。

这引发了一场关于货币政策的辩论。债务人主张放松紧缩的货币政策，这种政策限制了人们获得宽松货币的途径。辩论的焦点在于那些支持硬通货（黄金和白银）的人与支持纸币或软通货（如绿钞）的人之间。最终，这场辩论将在1890年代再次浮现，特别是当农民、农业部门和其他债务人群体想要廉价货币时——他们想要发行绿钞，他们想要“下钱雨”。

在担任两届总统后，又举行了一次选举，这是1876年的选举。格兰特下台了。共和党转向拉瑟福德·B·海斯，他与民主党的塞缪尔·蒂尔登竞争。这次选举非常重要，因为存在政治争议。有三个州的选举结果存在争议，而且都发生在南方各州。关于是共和党人海斯还是民主党人蒂尔登入主白宫，存在着巨大的争议。最终，达成了一项被称为1877年妥协案的协议。

在这个妥协案中，发生了几件事。首先，南方和民主党人将承认共和党人拉瑟福德·B·海斯——他将成为美国总统。作为他们承认海斯总统职位的交换，他将同意从南方撤出最后一批联邦军队，并正式结束重建。重建进程当时已经放缓——只有大约两三个南方州还有联邦军队——但他将撤出他们，并正式结束重建进程。最后，海斯和共和党人需要为南方提供政治职位、恩惠以及联邦援助，以修建一条贯穿德克萨斯州的南方跨大陆铁路。

重要的是要记住，1877年妥协案是重建的正式结束。随着联邦军队的撤离——那些保护非裔美国人和共和党政府的军队——他们被撤走了，重建也被放弃了。

不仅仅是联邦军队的撤离结束了重建。法院也破坏了它。这里简单回顾一下——还记得1875年的《民权法案》吗？它保护了权利，在该法案中，它规定任何个人拒绝充分和平等地使用公共场所都是犯罪行为。它还禁止在陪审团的挑选过程中存在种族歧视。因此，1875年的《民权法案》旨在保护非裔美国人的权利。但在1883年的《民权案件》中，法院推翻了该法律。在这些案件中，最高法院表示，第十四修正案仅保护公民权利免受政府侵犯。翻译过来就是：个人可以随意歧视。因此，如果铁路公司、酒店或其他企业想要歧视，他们有权这样做。因此，1875年的《民权法案》被推翻了。

重要的是要记住，随着重建被放弃，“吉姆·克劳法”将在南方各地蔓延。法院的判决将支持南方各地的种族隔离法律。1896年的“普莱西诉弗格森案”非常重要。在该案中，最高法院裁定，如果为每个种族提供平等的设施，种族隔离是合乎宪法的。这确立了“隔离但平等”的原则。我们都希望知道，它总是隔离的，但从未平等。因此，“吉姆·克劳法”在南方各地蔓延，而法院对其进行了认可和批准。

你们还应该记住重建时期和后重建时期“新南方”的理念。这个理念尤其受到南方人——少数南方人——的推动，他们认为南方将重建，将实现工业化，并将发展他们的经济。但现实是，尽管有这些对“新南方”的呼吁，是的，南方纺织厂的数量有所增加，但南方在很大程度上仍将是农业地区。分成制农业和佃农制将继续是主要的经济活动。后重建时期南方非裔美国人的生活将继续充满许多挑战。

我给你们举几个例子。还记得第十五修正案赋予了黑人男性投票权——而不是女性——这是一个很大的争议。你们慢慢地看到南方黑人被系统性地剥夺了选举权。这是通过多种方式实现的。你们可以看到暴力和恐吓是一种方式，但像文化程度测试、人头税、财产要求等也被用来剥夺非裔美国选民的选举权。他们还设立了“祖父条款”，该条款规定，在1860年或之前参加过选举的任何人都可以免除选举要求——这意味着白人不必满足这些选举要求。

你们看到——如果你们还记得那场短暂的社会和政治革命，共和党人和黑人选民赢得了南方各州——在重建结束后，这种情况将迅速瓦解。民主党将主导南方。白人民主党政府——所谓的“救赎者”——正在重新夺回南方各地的政治权力。

在此期间发生的另一件事——有点超出重建范围——是亚洲移民的大幅增加，特别是来自中国的移民。中国移民，特别是中国男性，将在矿业繁荣（你们可以在底部照片中看到中国矿工）和铁路建设中发挥巨大作用。在那些经济繁荣和萧条的周期结束后，中国移民将分散到整个西部。但针对亚洲移民的本土主义情绪将会激增，尤其是在他们人口较多的西部。结果，你们将看到一项非常重要的法律——1882年的《排华法案》，该法案禁止中国劳工进一步移民到美国。

这是一项极其重要的法律，因为这是第一次基于种族和国籍实施移民限制。你们在《排华法案》中看到的是一项因种族而歧视中国移民的国家政策。

很快，我们将来看一下镀金时代的总统们，你们不需要记住这些人。事实上，他们经常被戏称为“被遗忘的总统”。他们的名字也是最糟糕的——拉瑟福德、加菲尔德、切斯特、格罗弗等等。但你们可以看到，你们有共和党人，也有民主党人在任。镀金时代——重要的是你们要记住——是内战后、重建后，经济和人口快速增长的时期。“镀金时代”这个词是马克·吐温创造的，他用这个词来讽刺批评这个时代。在这次讲座中，我们只关注镀金时代的政治方面。

你们需要直接从APUSH课程中记住的一个关键点是，镀金时代的政治与大企业密切相关，并且在全国范围内关注关税和货币政策等经济问题——我知道，这非常性感和令人兴奋。镀金时代的两大政党都将忽视工业化的政治和社会后果。因此，贫困和恶劣工作条件的出现将被共和党人和民主党人忽视，因为他们将信奉自由放任的理念——让事情顺其自然。政府不应该监管或监督社会。重要的是你们要记住，无论我们看哪位总统，他们都将在很大程度上奉行亲商业的政策。

我们已经看到了一个例子，即货币问题倾向于硬通货——黄金或白银。但我们将要看的另一个成为全国政治问题的议题是公务员制度改革和关税。两党都使用恩惠制度，这一切都归结于公务员职位给予支持者的理念——“胜者拥有战利品”。我们在杰克逊的讲座中讨论过分赃制度。对公务员制度的批评和改革呼声日益高涨。人们普遍认为这些人经常腐败，不知道自己在做什么，他们获得这份工作的唯一原因就是忠诚。因此，人们呼吁改革这一点。

你们还需要记住，政党内部存在两个阵营。一个是“半血统派”，主张公务员制度改革，他们的领导人是詹姆斯·布莱恩。另一个是“顽固派”，他们是恩惠制度的支持者，罗斯科·康克林是他们的最佳代表。

关税也是你们需要记住的镀金时代政治的一个议题。当时发生的一件大事是，到1880年代，美国财政部由于关税而拥有巨额盈余——有很多钱。人们——你们看到格罗弗·克利夫兰、民主党人、农民和其他人——想要削减这些关税。这将是这一时期的重大议题。

几个需要记住的关键点：海斯——拉瑟福德·B·海斯——他是通过有争议的选举当选的，1877年妥协案解决了这个问题。他确实派遣联邦军队镇压了伟大的铁路罢工——派遣联邦军队镇压一个工会，我们将在另一段视频中详细了解这一点。詹姆斯·加菲尔德——他当选了，他也是一位共和党人，他被暗杀了，他的副总统切斯特·亚瑟接任。他支持——令人惊讶的是，因为他是一位顽固派——《彭德尔顿法案》，该法案确立了公务员制度改革。它设立了公务员委员会，以便人们获得联邦工作必须参加竞争性考试，以证明他们有能力胜任这项工作。

格罗弗·克利夫兰——民主党人在1884年的选举中重新夺回了白宫。他是自由放任的坚定倡导者——他们大多数人都是如此。他的名言是：“虽然人民支持政府，但政府不应该支持人民。”他确实签署了《州际商务法》，我们将在另一章中讨论该法案。然后，共和党人在本杰明·哈里森（前总统的孙子）的领导下重新夺回了白宫。他主张维持高关税。事实上，在他的总统任期内，将出现所谓的“十亿美元国会”，他们在1890年将通过《麦金利关税法》——美国历史上最高的关税之一——并增加内战老兵的养老金。

当然，在美国历史上，一位总统将第一次也是唯一一次重返白宫，担任一个不连续的第二任期。我们将在其他视频中详细了解这一时期发生的事情。

今天就到这里。我希望你们觉得镀金时代的政治很有趣——这是我在美国历史上最不喜欢的议题。但如果你们有任何问题，你们可以随时发表评论，如果你们还没有点赞这个视频，请点赞，订阅，告诉你们的朋友们也这样做，并在考试中取得五分，各位。APUSH野兽模式。再见。

We are back, APUSH homeboys and homegirls. Today we're going to take a look at Gilded Age politics, roughly from 1868 to the 1890s. And in 1868, there's an election, and President Grant - the Civil War General Grant - wins the presidency for the Republican Party in 1868. This guy has no real political experience, but he was a hero, so he wins the presidency. And really, a big part of his victory comes from the fact that there was a temporary social and political revolution going on in the South during Reconstruction when black voters were able to vote for the first time. And those black voters are voting for the Republican candidates, and the freedmen give the Republican Party a huge boost.

Now the problem for Grant is there's going to be a lot of corruption during his administration, and it's really the people around him that are the kind of key culprits in this corruption. There's an event called the Credit Mobilier Affair where his vice president and members of Congress are involved in the sale of railroad stock, and it's a whole scandal there where they're personally enriching themselves. You have the Whiskey Ring in 1875 where Grant's private secretary is found to be stealing $3 million from the federal government in a tax corruption scheme. And there's many other examples of this corruption. In fact, the term "Grantism" is a term that was used to describe corruption in politics. So Grant's going to have a hard time as president.

Now the ultimate symbol of Gilded Age political corruption could be seen in Boss Tweed. And this is local political corruption because in a place in New York City, there was a political machine run by the Democratic Party called Tammany Hall. And the boss of that political party was that guy right there - Boss Tweed. And he's going to use bribery, graft, and fraud to steal over $200 million from New York taxpayers. And really, he is and Tammany Hall itself is the symbol of this corruption. And unfortunately for Boss Tweed, Thomas Nast, a political cartoonist, will ultimately expose this corruption to the masses as you see in that political cartoon right there.

Now something bad happens in 1873 - there's a panic. And the Panic of 1873 really kind of hurts the entire economy because it's a severe economic collapse that further distracts the nation from enforcing Reconstruction. And so there's this huge panic - banks are failing, huge amount of unemployment, businesses failing as well. And there's some causes here that are revealing that the economy is not healthy. One is overproduction in industries such as factories, railroad, and mining. And over-speculation by bankers - they were giving out too much money that couldn't be paid back. And this panic lasts for a number of years, and the hard times are going to be inflicted worst on the debtors and farmers and people in those categories.

And this brings up a debate over monetary policies. Debtors advocate for relaxation of tight money policies where there is a restriction to the access to easy money. And the debate comes down to those who favor hard currency - gold and silver - versus paper money or soft currency such as greenbacks. And ultimately, it is going to be a debate that's going to reemerge especially in the 1890s when farmers, the agrarian sector, and other debtor groups want cheap money - they want greenbacks issued, they want to make it rain.

Well after two terms as president, there's another election, and this is the election of 1876. Grant's gone. The Republicans turn to Rutherford B. Hayes, and he's running against the Democrat Samuel Tilden. And this election is a very important election because there is a political controversy. Three of the states' returns are contested, and they all happen to be in Southern states. And there's a big controversy as to whether or not it's going to be the Republican guy Hayes or the Democrat Tilden to take the White House. And ultimately, a compromise is reached called the Compromise of 1877.

And in this compromise, a couple things happen. One, the South and Democrats will recognize the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes - he will become the president of the United States. In exchange for them recognizing Hayes' presidency, he would agree to pull out the last federal troops from the South and formally end Reconstruction. It was already kind of slowing down - there were only federal troops in about two or three Southern states - but he's going to pull them out and formally end the Reconstruction process. And then finally, Hayes, the Republicans need to provide the South with political positions, patronage, and federal aid for the building of a transcontinental railroad for the South through Texas.

And important to keep in mind is this Compromise of 1877 is the formal end of Reconstruction. And as the federal troops are withdrawn - those troops which were protecting African-Americans and the Republican governments - they are withdrawn and Reconstruction is abandoned.

Now it's not just the federal troops leaving which ends Reconstruction. The courts also undermined it. Little review here - remember the Civil Rights Act of 1875? This protected rights, and in this act of 1875, it made it a crime for any individual to deny full and equal use of public places. It also prohibited racial discrimination in jury selection. So this Civil Rights Act of 1875 was designed to protect the rights of African-Americans. And in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883, the courts strike that law down. In these cases, the Supreme Court says the 14th Amendment only protected against government violations of civil rights. Translation: individuals can discriminate all they want. So if railroad companies or hotels or other businesses would like to discriminate, they have the right to do so. Therefore, the Civil Rights Act of 1875 is overturned.

And what's important to keep in mind is as Reconstruction is abandoned, Jim Crow laws are going to spread throughout the South. And the courts' decisions are going to support segregation laws throughout the South. And very important is Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. And in this case, the Supreme Court rules racial segregation was constitutional if equal facilities were made available to each race. And this establishes the "separate but equal" doctrine. And we all hopefully know it was always separate but never equal. And so you get Jim Crow laws spreading segregation throughout the South, and it is validated and approved by the courts.

And another thing you should keep in mind is this idea of the New South in the Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction era. This idea was promoted especially by Southerners - a few Southerners - that the South would rebuild, it would industrialize, and they would develop their economy. But the reality is in spite of these calls for this New South, yes, there's a rise in textile factories in the South, the South is going to largely remain agrarian. Sharecropping and tenant farming is going to continue to be the dominant economic activity. And life for African-Americans in the post-Reconstruction South is going to continue to be filled with many challenges.

Let me give you a couple of examples. 15th Amendment, if you recall, gave black men the right to vote - not women - and this was a big controversy. And slowly, you see the systematic disenfranchisement of Southern blacks. And this was done in a number of ways. And you could see violence and intimidation was one, but also things like literacy tests, poll taxes, property requirements were designed to disenfranchise African-American voters. They also established grandfather clauses which exempted from electoral requirements anyone who had voted in the election of 1860 or prior - which meant white people did not have to fulfill these electoral requirements.

And what you see - if you recall that temporary social and political revolution where Republicans and black voters were winning Southern states - that's going to quickly fall apart after Reconstruction ends. And Democrats are going to dominate the South. White Democratic governments - the so-called Redeemers - are reassuming political power throughout the South.

One other thing that's happening during this time period - kind of outside of Reconstruction - is a huge increase, a large increase in Asian immigration, especially from China. And Chinese immigrants, especially Chinese men, are going to play a huge role in the mining booms - you can see Chinese miners at that bottom photo - and in the building of the railroads. And after those kind of economic boom and bust cycles take place, Chinese immigrants are going to spread out throughout the West. But there's going to be a spike in nativism towards Asian immigrants, especially in the West where their populations were larger. And as a result of this, you're going to get a very important law - the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prohibited further immigration of Chinese laborers to the United States.

And this is a hugely important law because it's the first time immigration restrictions were put in place on the basis of race and nationality. And what you see in the Chinese Exclusion Act is a national policy of discrimination towards Chinese immigrants because of race.

Real quickly, we're going to take a look at the Gilded Age presidents, and you don't need to memorize these guys. In fact, very often they're kind of jokingly referred to as the forgotten presidents. They are the ones with the worst names ever - Rutherford, Garfield, Chester, Grover, and so on. But you could see, you know, you have Republicans, you have Democrats serving in office. And the Gilded Age - it's important you keep in mind - it's this post-Civil War, post-Reconstruction era of rapid economic and population growth. And that term Gilded Age was coined by Mark Twain, and he used it as a sarcastic term to criticize this era. And in this lecture, we're only going to take a look at the political aspects of the Gilded Age.

And one of the key things you need to keep in mind directly from the APUSH curriculum is Gilded Age politics were intimately tied to big business and focused nationally on economic issues such as tariffs and currency policy - real sexy and exciting stuff, I know. Both political parties during the Gilded Age are going to ignore the political and social consequences of industrialization. So the rise of poverty and bad working conditions are going to be ignored by the Republicans and Democrats because there's going to be a belief in this idea of laissez-faire - to leave things alone. The government should not regulate or monitor society. And it's important you keep in mind no matter which president we're looking at, they are largely going to pursue a pro-business policy.

And we've already seen one example with the currency issue favoring the kind of hard money - gold or silver. But one other issue that we're going to look at that becomes an issue in national politics is civil service reform and tariffs. Patronage was used by both political parties, and that all goes down to this idea that civil service jobs were given to supporters - you know, "to the victor belongs the spoils." We saw the spoils system talked about during the Jackson lecture. And there was growing criticism and calls for reform of the civil service. There was this perception that these people were very often corrupt and did not know what they were doing, and the only reason they got the job was because of loyalty. And so there were calls for people to reform that.

Another thing that you need to kind of keep in mind is that you have two camps within the political parties. One - Half-Breeds - advocated civil service reform, and their leader is James Blaine. And the other group was the Stalwarts, and these were supporters of patronage, and they're best represented by Roscoe Conkling.

Tariffs was also an issue that you need to keep in mind for Gilded Age politics. And a big thing that was happening is by the 1880s, the U.S. Treasury had a huge surplus from tariffs - there was a lot of money. And people - you see Grover Cleveland, the Democrats, and farmers and others - wanted to cut those tariffs down and lower those tariffs. And that's going to be a big issue during this period.

A couple key things to keep in mind: Hayes - Rutherford B. Hayes - he's the guy who gets elected in the disputed election, and the Compromise of 1877 settles that. He does send federal troops to break up the Great Railroad Strike - sending in the federal troops to break up a labor union, and we'll learn a little bit more about that in another video. James Garfield - he's elected, he's also a Republican, he's assassinated, and his VP Chester Arthur takes over. And he supports - surprisingly, since he is a Stalwart - the Pendleton Act, which establishes civil service reform. And it establishes the Civil Service Commission so that people to get federal jobs had to take a competitive exam to prove that they were capable of doing the job.

Grover Cleveland - the Democrats regain the White House in 1884 in the election of 1884. He is a strong advocate of laissez-faire - most of these guys are. His famous quote: "Though the people support the government, the government should not support the people." He does sign into law the Interstate Commerce Act, which we'll take a look at in another chapter. And then the Republicans regain the White House with Benjamin Harrison - the grandson of the former president. He advocates for keeping the tariff high. In fact, during his presidency, there's going to be this so-called "Billion Dollar Congress," and they in 1890 are going to pass the McKinley Tariff - one of the highest tariffs in American history - and also increase the Civil War pensions.

And then of course, for the first and only time in American history, a president will come back into the White House to serve a non-consecutive second term. And we'll take a look at a little bit more about what happens during this time period in other videos.

That's going to do it for today. I hope you found Gilded Age politics exciting - it's my least favorite topic in American history. But if you have any questions, you can always post a comment, click like on the video if you haven't done so, subscribe, tell some friends to do the same, and get a five on that exam, people. APUSH beast mode. Peace.
