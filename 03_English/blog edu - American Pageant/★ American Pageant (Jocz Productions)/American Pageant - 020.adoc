各位APUSH的同学们，大家好！今天我们要快速回顾一下APUSH考试中你需要了解的关键内战战役。就像内战时期的胡须一样，我真希望我可以一整天都在谈论内战中那些精彩绝伦、史诗般的战斗。战役非常多。今天我们只看几个关键点。

但你们应该记住——这是美国历史上最致命的战争。超过60万美国人在内战中丧生，这张图表能让你们对此有个概念。

所以，关键的内战战役：一是第一次布尔 Run 战役，1861年7月。基本上证明了这场战争不会是短暂的。南方在布尔 Run 战役中获胜。事实上，在战争的初期，南方赢得了许多早期的战斗。嗯，你们应该了解的其中一个战略是温菲尔德·斯科特的“蟒蛇计划”，它基本上是利用美国海军封锁南方邦联的海岸，并最终希望控制密西西比河的计划。

嗯，安提耶坦战役——另一个你需要记住的重要战役——发生在1862年9月，罗伯特·E·李将北上进入边境州马里兰州，他希望为南方邦联赢得外国承认，并可能将一些边境州拉入邦联一方的冲突。事情并没有如愿发展。技术上来说这是一场平局——没有人获胜——但罗伯特·E·李撤退到弗吉尼亚州。林肯因为觉得北方占据了优势，准备宣布《解放奴隶宣言》。而对于南方邦联来说，争取外国承认的希望破灭了。

嗯，那位你们真的需要了解的人——随着战争的进行，联邦领导层的关键人物——尤利西斯·S·格兰特。他在西部的田纳西州赢得了一些急需的胜利。当然，最重要的是1863年7月4日的维克斯堡战役。那实际上是紧挨着的两次巨大的失败。第一次是葛底斯堡战役。罗伯特·E·李再次希望在联邦领土上打击北方，入侵宾夕法尼亚州。最终他失败了，被迫撤退回弗吉尼亚州。另一场发生在7月的战役是维克斯堡战役。经过长时间的围攻，格兰特将军赢得了维克斯堡战役，联邦军队现在完全控制了密西西比河。

嗯，另一个你需要了解的重要人物是威廉·特库姆塞·谢尔曼——另一位联邦将军。他率领军队在南方进行了一场蓄意破坏的行军，这种策略被称为“全面战争”。当他穿过南方，尤其是在佐治亚州时，他摧毁了一切，包括南方的基础设施。最终，亚特兰大于1864年9月陷落。联邦的这次胜利帮助林肯赢得了连任。他一直打到海岸——你们可以在地图上看到——12月攻陷了萨凡纳市。这就是全面战争——摧毁南方环境和基础设施的所有方面。

当然，战争在1865年4月9日于阿波马托克斯法院大楼突然结束。罗伯特·E·李投降了。几天后的1865年4月14日，约翰·威尔克斯·布斯在福特剧院刺杀了林肯。

这些是你们需要了解的关键战役的快速回顾。感谢观看。再见。
