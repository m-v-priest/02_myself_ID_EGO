All right, in this video we're going to break down 剖析 part two of period 8 -- 1945 to 1980. This is the domestic review 国内回顾. Make sure if you haven't already done so, go check out part one and learn all about the foreign policy stuff.

Another important thing to keep in mind is the fact that liberal principles 自由主义原则 came to dominate post-war politics and court decisions. Little context for you -- the image of prosperity 繁荣 of the 1950s was called into question 质疑 with publication of "The Other America" by Michael Harrington, which brought to the attention of the nation poverty 贫困 in America. And the continued lack of civil rights 民权 remained a problem. Johnson's Great Society 伟大社会 is going to dramatically increase the scope and size of the federal government 联邦政府. This is considered the high tide 高潮 of liberalism 自由主义. Keep in mind presidents Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy also had their own liberal agendas 议程 domestically, but it's really going to be Johnson's presidency where you're going to see a lot of movement in this area.

You have programs like Head Start which provided affordable preschool 学前教育. Job Corps which gave vocational education 职业教育. Medicare -- health care 医疗保健 for those over the age of 65. Medicaid -- health care for the poor and disabled 残疾的. You have a huge reform with immigration in the form of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 1965年移民与国籍法. This ended the quotas 配额 designed to restrict certain nationalities -- got rid of those quotas from the 1920s -- and as a result post-1965 immigration to the U.S. is going to be very different as people from Asia, Latin America and other parts of the globe are able to come in in increasing numbers. We're going to take a look at the Great Society's civil rights contributions in another slide.

It's also important to keep in mind though that Supreme Court decisions of the Warren Court also greatly expanded individual freedoms 自由 and democracy 民主. A couple of examples of this expansion of freedom and democracy can be seen in *Yates v. United States* where the court rules the First Amendment 第一修正案 protects radical 激进的 and revolutionary speech 言论. *Griswold v. Connecticut* -- state citizens have a right to privacy 隐私权, thus birth control 节育 cannot be prohibited 禁止. And in the famous case of *Miranda v. Arizona*, you get the establishment of the Miranda rights 米兰达权利 -- the right to remain silent, to speak with an attorney 律师, protection for those accused of a crime.

In spite of 尽管 all these different reforms including the civil rights ones -- look at in just a second -- it's important to note that the rise of liberalism will be accompanied by criticisms 批评 from both the left and the right. Which leads us to what were those criticisms? On the left, people felt that not enough was being done for civil rights and poverty, and you're going to see the rise of black radicalism 激进主义 -- black power movement in the form of groups like the Black Panthers and Malcolm X -- more on them in just a moment. Many on the left were highly critical of U.S. foreign policy. Johnson's Great Society is really going to be undone 破坏 by his role of escalating 升级 the war in Vietnam. Many people were increasingly opposed to the war as we have already mentioned because of things like the Tet Offensive 春节攻势, the My Lai Massacre 美莱村屠杀, the bombing of Cambodia, and they felt U.S. foreign policy were increasingly immoral 不道德的.

On the left you see the rise of the UC Berkeley Free Speech Movement, the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) which issued the *Port Huron Statement*, and other so-called New Left movements spread across college campuses. And really this division 分裂 can be seen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. Johnson refuses to run for re-election and riots 暴动 occur outside the DNC's convention.

On the right you're going to have criticisms. In fact in the election of 1964, Barry Goldwater loses to Lyndon Johnson, but he starts to represent the rising conservative movement 保守主义运动. They have many different criticism of liberalism. They don't like a large federal government. They criticized the high deficits 赤字 and cost of programs under the Great Society under the New Deal. They did not like the decisions of the Warren Court -- they felt that these judges were being activist judges making laws rather than interpreting 解释 laws. And they increasingly felt the traditional morality 道德 was being undermined 破坏 especially after the *Roe v. Wade* decision in 1973.

Conservatives are going to get a big victory in 1968 with the election of Republican Richard Nixon. However, his presidency domestically will come undone as a result of the Watergate scandal 水门事件 which will further erode 削弱 trust in the federal government. But in 1980 you're going to really see conservative triumph 胜利 with the election of Ronald Reagan as he pursues his policies of Reaganomics 里根经济学 -- tax cuts 减税 for the rich and deregulation 放松管制 -- along with the triumph of conservatism in the 1980s. You're going to see a rising Christian fundamentalist movement 基督教原教旨主义运动 mobilizing 动员 on a variety of social issues.

Make sure you know about civil rights. And one of the key things about this is that all three branches of government helped advance the cause of civil rights and greater racial justice 种族正义. We saw this with the executive branch 行政部门 -- remember Harry Truman following World War II desegregated 废除种族隔离 the military with Executive Order 9981. This led to Southern Democrats some forming the Dixiecrats. We saw this with the judicial branch 司法部门 -- *Plessy v. Ferguson* is overturned 推翻 in the *Brown v. Board of Education* decision where the court ruled segregation 种族隔离 is inherently 本质上 unequal and must end with all deliberate speed. And under Johnson, the legislative branch 立法部门 -- Congress passed, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 1964年民权法案 which made segregation illegal in all public facilities 公共设施 and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 平等就业机会委员会 that banned discrimination 歧视 in employment.

You also see in 1965 -- part of the Great Society -- the Voting Rights Act of 1965 1965年选举权法 which ended at efforts to prevent African-Americans from voting in the South. So literacy tests 识字测试 are banned. And then of course the 24th Amendment -- poll taxes 人头税 were ruled unconstitutional 违宪的.

In spite of these three branches of government helping advance the cause of civil rights, it's really important you understand that civil rights advocates 倡导者 sought to fulfill the Reconstruction era promises and managed to slowly achieve some legal and political success. And way before the government was doing anything, you see civil rights organizations doing this work. World War II energized 激励 the civil rights movement. You have the Double Victory campaign 双重胜利运动. Organizations like CORE forming and the NAACP membership increased. There's a variety of tactics 策略 to trying to fight for civil rights. These include legal challenges, direct action and nonviolence 非暴力. And as we already stated, remember the NAACP led by Thurgood Marshall managed to win a victory against segregation in the *Brown v. Board of Education*.

Other examples of civil rights victories and protests -- you have the Montgomery Bus Boycott 蒙哥马利巴士抵制 in 1955 sparked by the arrest of Rosa Parks. The Greensboro Lunch Counter sit-in 格林斯伯勒午餐柜台静坐示威. Freedom Riders 自由骑士 rode buses organized by the Congress of Racial Equality into the segregated South. And the Freedom Summer 自由之夏 where civil rights activists sought to register people to vote. Fannie Lou Hamer takes a big role in this movement with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in 1964. And really important to keep in mind is you're going to have various grassroots movements 基层运动 pressuring 施压 for civil rights well into the 1960s pressuring the government to do more.

In spite of this mobilization 动员, you're going to see intense resistance 抵抗 slowed the pace of desegregation 废除种族隔离. In fact following the *Brown v. Board of Education* decision, you have the Southern Manifesto 南方宣言 which denounced 谴责 the Brown decision and Southerners criticize the Supreme Court. In Arkansas you have the Little Rock Nine being prevented from going to school. President Eisenhower has to send in troops 军队 to finally protect the Little Rock Nine. And violence 暴力 is going to occur during many of these civil rights protests such as the Freedom Rides, the Freedom Summer. Civil rights activists are going to be murdered and various other forms of resistance and violence.

As a result of this slow pace of change and this continued Southern resistance, you're going to have tactical and philosophical 哲学上的 differences increase between civil rights organizations. Some of the civil rights movement began to question the nonviolent tactics and philosophy. In 1965 in Watts you have the riots breakout following an arrest of a black motorist by white police officers. Member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Stokely Carmichael called for black power -- economic power in the black community, racial separatism 种族分离主义. And Malcolm X joined the Nation of Islam and he emphasized 强调 black nationalism 黑人民族主义, self-improvement and separatism as well. And in Oakland, California you have the Black Panthers 黑豹党 formed by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale who called for community organizing as well as African-Americans to arm themselves.

Partly because they are inspired by the success and activism of the civil rights movement and growing awareness of the inequalities 不平等 in American society, other groups began to mobilize. In 1963 Betty Friedan with *The Feminine Mystique* challenged traditional gender roles 性别角色. In the 1950s and 60s the family structure was changing as the number of women working increased. You see organizations like NOW -- the National Organization for Women -- founded by women's rights activists bringing attention to the issue of inequality with regard to women. And we start seeing some victories occur such as in 1972 Congress passed Title IX 教育修正案第九条 which sought to end sex discrimination 性别歧视 in schools. In spite of that victory, the Equal Rights Amendment 平等权利修正案 fell short of ratification 批准 by three states. A lot of the opposition came from good old Phyllis Schlafly. And in 1973 the Supreme Court in *Roe v. Wade* struck down 废除 laws prohibiting abortion 堕胎 on the grounds that they were a violation of a woman's right to privacy. And this decision legalizes abortion.

You're going to see the rise of other civil rights movements such as the American Indian Movement -- it's founded in 1968 and it brought attention to the plight 困境 of native people in American life. You're going to have occupations 占领 of federal land like at Alcatraz. Cesar Chavez leads the United Farm Workers movement organizing farm workers and leading a national grape boycott 抵制 getting a victory for those individuals. The Immigration Act as we mentioned allows for new immigrants to come into the U.S. increasingly making America more and more diverse 多元化的. And in 1978 the *University of California v. Bakke* upheld 支持 affirmative action 平权行动 which basically means race could be one of several factors in admission to the university.

The LGBT movement -- it's important to know about in 1968 there are the Stonewall riots 石墙暴动 which is really considered the birth of the gay rights movement in American society.

Finally, let's close out with some kind of quick overview of society and economics in this time period. Remember rapid economic and social changes in American society in the post-World War II years led to a sense of optimism 乐观, but it also increased tensions 紧张局势. What the heck am I talking about? The rise of the American middle class 中产阶级 is a key part of this time period -- especially the late 40s and throughout the 50s as Americans enjoyed increased social mobility 社会流动性. You have a mass movement in the '50s to the suburbs 郊区 -- places like Levittown. And there's a post-war baby boom 婴儿潮. And a lot of this economic growth comes from Cold War defense spending 国防开支 in places like the West Coast but also in the Sun Belt 阳光地带 out in the south in the west. This area is going to become increasingly important both economically and politically.

Television plays a role in this standardization 标准化 of American culture. But there is going to be challenges to the conformity 从众 of the 1950s, and you're going to see that in the growth of the Beat Movement 垮掉的一代运动, the beatniks, rock and roll music. And really in the 1960s you're going to see the rise of a counterculture 反主流文化 -- for example the hippies 嬉皮士 -- which rejected 拒绝 many of the social, economic and political values of the previous generation.

In the '60s you're going to see a sexual revolution 性革命 where birth control such as the pill -- which becomes available in 1960 -- and access to abortion with *Roe v. Wade* is going to allow for all sorts of changes in American society. These changes do lead to significant political and moral debates. And as mentioned previously, you're going to see the rise of the conservative movement not just for political reasons but also in their minds for moral reasons with the Christian fundamentalists. And it's important you know the causes of this. You have this fear of juvenile delinquency 青少年犯罪 -- for example the hippies. The growing urban unrest 城市动荡 in the 1960s. The challenges to the traditional family. And the perceived failures of the federal government policies during the New Deal in the Great Society. All of these things led to efforts to promote conservatives and Christian fundamentalists to promote their own values and ideology 意识形态.

好的，在这个视频中，我们将分析第八时期的第二部分——1945年至1980年。这是国内回顾。如果你们还没有看过第一部分，务必去看看，了解所有关于外交政策的内容。

另一个需要记住的重要事实是，自由主义原则在战后政治和法院判决中占据主导地位。给你们一点背景——迈克尔·哈灵顿出版的《另一个美国》质疑了1950年代的繁荣景象，这本书使全国关注到美国的贫困问题。而公民权利的持续缺失仍然是一个问题。约翰逊的“伟大社会”将极大地扩大联邦政府的范围和规模。这被认为是自由主义的鼎盛时期。记住，哈里·杜鲁门总统、约翰·肯尼迪总统在国内也有他们自己的自由主义议程，但真正看到这一领域大量行动的是约翰逊的总统任期。

你们有像“启智计划”这样的项目，它提供了负担得起的学前教育。“就业培训计划”提供了职业教育。“医疗保险”为65岁以上的人提供医疗保健。“医疗补助”为穷人和残疾人提供医疗保健。1965年的《移民和国籍法》对移民进行了巨大的改革。这项法案结束了旨在限制某些国籍人士的配额——废除了1920年代的那些配额——结果，1965年后美国移民的构成将非常不同，来自亚洲、拉丁美洲和全球其他地区的人们能够以越来越多的数量进入美国。我们将在另一张幻灯片上探讨“伟大社会”在民权方面的贡献。

然而，同样重要的是要记住，沃伦法院的最高法院判决也极大地扩大了个人自由和民主。这种自由和民主扩张的几个例子可以在“耶茨诉美国案”中看到，法院裁定第一修正案保护激进和革命性的言论。“格里斯沃尔德诉康涅狄格州案”——州公民拥有隐私权，因此不能禁止节育。在著名的“米兰达诉亚利桑那州案”中，你们得到了“米兰达权利”的确立——保持沉默的权利、与律师交谈的权利、对被指控犯罪的人的保护。

尽管有所有这些不同的改革，包括我们稍后会看到的民权改革，但重要的是要注意，自由主义的兴起将伴随着来自左翼和右翼的批评。这就引出了这些批评是什么？在左翼，人们认为在民权和贫困方面做得不够，你们将看到黑人激进主义的兴起——以黑豹党和马尔科姆X为代表的黑人权力运动——我们稍后会详细介绍。许多左翼人士对美国的外交政策持高度批评态度。约翰逊的“伟大社会”实际上将被他升级越南战争的角色所破坏。正如我们已经提到的，由于像春节攻势、美莱村大屠杀和轰炸柬埔寨这样的事件，许多人越来越反对这场战争，他们认为美国的外交政策越来越不道德。

在左翼，你们看到了加州大学伯克利分校的言论自由运动、“民主社会学生会”（SDS）发表了《休伦港声明》以及其他所谓的“新左派”运动在大学校园蔓延。这种分裂在1968年芝加哥民主党全国代表大会上真正体现出来。约翰逊拒绝竞选连任，并在民主党全国代表大会场外发生了骚乱。

在右翼，你们将看到批评。事实上，在1964年的选举中，巴里·戈德华特输给了林登·约翰逊，但他开始代表日益壮大的保守主义运动。他们对自由主义有许多不同的批评。他们不喜欢庞大的联邦政府。他们批评了新政和“伟大社会”时期的高赤字和项目成本。他们不喜欢沃伦法院的判决——他们认为这些法官是行动主义法官，他们是在制定法律而不是解释法律。他们越来越觉得传统道德正在被破坏，尤其是在1973年“罗伊诉韦德案”判决之后。

保守派将在1968年共和党人理查德·尼克松当选总统时取得重大胜利。然而，他的国内政策将因“水门丑闻”而瓦解，这将进一步削弱人们对联邦政府的信任。但在1980年，随着罗纳德·里根当选总统，你们将真正看到保守主义的胜利，他推行他的“里根经济学”政策——为富人减税和放松管制——以及1980年代保守主义的胜利。你们将看到一个日益壮大的基督教原教旨主义运动在各种社会问题上动员起来。

确保你们了解民权运动。其中一个关键点是，政府的所有三个部门都帮助推动了民权事业和更大的种族正义。我们看到了行政部门——记住，哈里·杜鲁门在二战后通过第9981号行政命令解除了军队的种族隔离。这导致一些南方民主党人组成了“迪克西民主党”。我们看到了司法部门——“普莱西诉弗格森案”在“布朗诉教育委员会案”的判决中被推翻，法院裁定种族隔离本质上是不平等的，必须以一切可能的迅速行动结束。在约翰逊领导下，立法部门——国会通过，林登·约翰逊签署了1964年的《民权法案》，该法案使所有公共设施的种族隔离非法，并成立了“平等就业机会委员会”，禁止就业歧视。

你们还在1965年——“伟大社会”的一部分——看到了1965年的《投票权法案》，该法案结束了阻止南方非裔美国人投票的努力。因此，文化程度测试被禁止了。当然，还有第二十四修正案——人头税被裁定为违宪。

尽管政府的这三个部门都帮助推动了民权事业，但真正重要的是你们要理解，民权倡导者试图实现重建时期的承诺，并设法缓慢地取得了一些法律和政治上的成功。早在政府采取任何行动之前，你们就看到了民权组织在做这项工作。第二次世界大战激发了民权运动的活力。你们看到了“双重胜利”运动。像“种族平等大会”（CORE）这样的组织成立，全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）的成员人数增加。争取民权有各种各样的策略，包括法律挑战、直接行动和非暴力。正如我们已经提到的，记住，由瑟古德·马歇尔领导的全国有色人种协进会在“布朗诉教育委员会案”中成功地赢得了反对种族隔离的胜利。

其他民权胜利和抗议的例子——你们看到了1955年罗莎·帕克斯被捕引发的蒙哥马利巴士抵制运动。格林斯伯勒的午餐柜台静坐示威。“自由乘车者”乘坐由种族平等大会组织的巴士进入实行种族隔离的南方。“自由之夏”运动中，民权活动家试图登记人们参加投票。范妮·卢·哈默在1964年学生非暴力协调委员会的这项运动中发挥了重要作用。真正需要记住的是，你们将看到各种基层运动在1960年代持续施压争取民权，迫使政府采取更多行动。

尽管进行了动员，但你们将看到强烈的抵抗减缓了解除种族隔离的步伐。事实上，在“布朗诉教育委员会案”判决之后，你们看到了谴责布朗判决的“南方宣言”，南方人批评最高法院。在阿肯色州，小石城九人被阻止上学。艾森豪威尔总统不得不派遣军队最终保护小石城九人。在许多民权抗议活动中，例如“自由乘车”和“自由之夏”，都发生了暴力事件。民权活动家被谋杀，并遭受各种其他形式的抵抗和暴力。

由于变革的缓慢以及南方持续的抵抗，你们将看到民权组织之间的策略和哲学差异日益增大。一些民权运动开始质疑非暴力策略和哲学。1965年，在瓦茨区，一名黑人司机被白人警察逮捕后爆发了骚乱。学生非暴力协调委员会成员斯托克利·卡迈克尔呼吁“黑人权力”——黑人社区的经济权力、种族分离主义。马尔科姆X加入了伊斯兰民族，他也强调黑人民族主义、自我提升和分离主义。在加利福尼亚州奥克兰市，休伊·牛顿和鲍比·西尔创立了黑豹党，他们呼吁社区组织以及非裔美国人武装起来。

部分原因是受到民权运动成功和行动主义的鼓舞，以及对美国社会不平等现象日益增长的认识，其他群体也开始动员起来。1963年，贝蒂·弗里丹的《女性的奥秘》挑战了传统的性别角色。在1950年代和1960年代，随着女性就业人数的增加，家庭结构发生了变化。你们看到了像“全国妇女组织”（NOW）这样的组织，它由女权活动家创立，旨在引起人们对女性不平等问题的关注。我们开始看到一些胜利，例如1972年国会通过了《教育法修正案第九条》，该法案旨在结束学校中的性别歧视。尽管取得了这一胜利，《平等权利修正案》离获得足够州的批准还差三个州。许多反对意见来自老牌的菲利斯·施拉夫利。1973年，最高法院在“罗伊诉韦德案”中以禁止堕胎的法律侵犯了女性的隐私权为由，推翻了这些法律。这项判决使堕胎合法化。

你们将看到其他民权运动的兴起，例如“美国印第安人运动”——它成立于1968年，旨在引起人们对美国生活中土著人民困境的关注。你们将看到对联邦土地的占领，例如在恶魔岛。塞萨尔·查韦斯领导了“联合农场工人运动”，组织农场工人并发起全国性的葡萄抵制运动，为这些人赢得了胜利。正如我们提到的，《移民法案》允许新移民进入美国，使美国越来越多元化。1978年，“加利福尼亚大学诉巴克案”维持了平权行动，这基本上意味着种族可以作为大学录取考虑的几个因素之一。

同性恋、双性恋和跨性别者（LGBT）运动——重要的是要知道1969年发生了石墙骚乱，这被认为是美国社会同性恋权利运动的诞生。

最后，让我们简要概述一下这一时期的社会和经济状况。记住，二战后美国社会迅速的经济和社会变革带来了一种乐观情绪，但也加剧了紧张局势。我到底在说什么？美国中产阶级的崛起是这一时期的关键部分——尤其是在40年代末和整个50年代，美国人享受着日益增长的社会流动性。在50年代，你们看到了大规模向郊区迁移的现象——例如莱维敦这样的地方。而且出现了战后婴儿潮。许多经济增长来自冷战时期的国防开支，尤其是在西海岸以及南部和西部的阳光地带。这个地区在经济和政治上都将变得越来越重要。

电视在标准化美国文化方面发挥了作用。但是，1950年代的顺从性将受到挑战，你们将在“垮掉的一代”运动、垮掉派、摇滚音乐的兴起中看到这一点。而在1960年代，你们将真正看到反主流文化的兴起——例如嬉皮士——他们拒绝了上一代的许多社会、经济和政治价值观。

在60年代，你们将看到一场性革命，1960年上市的避孕药等节育措施以及“罗伊诉韦德案”带来的堕胎合法化将导致美国社会发生各种变化。这些变化确实导致了重大的政治和道德辩论。正如先前提到的，你们将看到保守主义运动的兴起，这不仅是出于政治原因，也是出于基督教原教旨主义者心目中的道德原因。重要的是你们要知道这些原因。你们对青少年犯罪（例如嬉皮士）、1960年代日益增长的城市动荡、对传统家庭的挑战以及新政和“伟大社会”时期联邦政府政策的明显失败感到恐惧。所有这些都导致了保守派和基督教原教旨主义者努力推广他们自己的价值观和意识形态。

All right, in this video we're going to break down part two of period 8 -- 1945 to 1980. This is the domestic review. Make sure if you haven't already done so, go check out part one and learn all about the foreign policy stuff.

Member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Stokely Carmichael called for black power -- economic power in the black community, racial separatism. And Malcolm X joined the Nation of Islam and he emphasized black nationalism, self-improvement and separatism as well. And in Oakland, California you have the Black Panthers formed by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale who called for community organizing as well as African-Americans to arm themselves.

Partly because they are inspired by the success and activism of the civil rights movement and growing awareness of the inequalities in American society, other groups began to mobilize. In 1963 Betty Friedan with "The Feminine Mystique" challenged traditional gender roles. In the 1950s and 60s the family structure was changing as the number of women working increased. You see organizations like NOW -- the National Organization for Women -- founded by women's rights activists bringing attention to the issue of inequality with regard to women. And we start seeing some victories occur such as in 1972 Congress passed Title IX which sought to end sex discrimination in schools. In spite of that victory, the Equal Rights Amendment fell short of ratification by three states. A lot of the opposition came from good old Phyllis Schlafly. And in 1973 the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade struck down laws prohibiting abortion on the grounds that they were a violation of a woman's right to privacy. And this decision legalizes abortion.

You're going to see the rise of other civil rights movements such as the American Indian Movement -- it's founded in 1968 and it brought attention to the plight of native people in American life. You're going to have occupations of federal land like at Alcatraz. Cesar Chavez leads the United Farm Workers movement organizing farm workers and leading a national grape boycott getting a victory for those individuals. The Immigration Act as we mentioned allows for new immigrants to come into the U.S. increasingly making America more and more diverse. And in 1978 the University of California v. Bakke upheld affirmative action which basically means race could be one of several factors in admission to the university.

The LGBT movement -- it's important to know about in 1968 there are the Stonewall riots which is really considered the birth of the gay rights movement in American society.

Finally, let's close out with some kind of quick overview of society and economics in this time period. Remember rapid economic and social changes in American society in the post-World War II years led to a sense of optimism, but it also increased tensions. What the heck am I talking about? The rise of the American middle class is a key part of this time period -- especially the late 40s and throughout the 50s as Americans enjoyed increased social mobility. You have a mass movement in the '50s to the suburbs -- places like Levittown. And there's a post-war baby boom. And a lot of this economic growth comes from Cold War defense spending in places like the West Coast but also in the Sun Belt out in the south in the west. This area is going to become increasingly important both economically and politically.

Television plays a role in this standardization of American culture. But there is going to be challenges to the conformity of the 1950s, and you're going to see that in the growth of the Beat Movement, the beatniks, rock and roll music. And really in the 1960s you're going to see the rise of a counterculture -- for example the hippies -- which rejected many of the social, economic and political values of the previous generation.

In the '60s you're going to see a sexual revolution where birth control such as the pill -- which becomes available in 1960 -- and access to abortion with Roe v. Wade is going to allow for all sorts of changes in American society. These changes do lead to significant political and moral debates. And as mentioned previously, you're going to see the rise of the conservative movement not just for political reasons but also in their minds for moral reasons with the Christian fundamentalists. And it's important you know the causes of this. You have this fear of juvenile delinquency -- for example the hippies. The growing urban unrest in the 1960s. The challenges to the traditional family. And the perceived failures of the federal government policies during the New Deal in the Great Society. All of these things led to efforts to promote conservatives and Christian fundamentalists to promote their own values and ideology.
