== 释义

What's going down, APUSH people? Today we're going to take a look at the South and the institution 制度；机构 of slavery. + 
 If you're reading any of those APUSH books—American Pageant chapter 16 or the other two—you see this lecture is going to help you out. + 


So, couple key things: slavery 奴隶制 in America's been going on unfortunately. + 
 The first slave ships come in 1619 to Jamestown, and of course, with Bacon's Rebellion 叛乱；反抗 in 1676, the colony 殖民地 of Virginia shifts from primarily indentured servants 契约仆人 to Black chattel slavery 动产奴隶制. + 
 Slavery was a major issue at the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议，um, but what happens is the framers 制定者 of the Constitution postpone 推迟；延迟 a solution to this problem—slavery—until later on. + 
 But we do have the Three-Fifths Compromise 五分之三妥协：美国制宪会议上达成的一项协议，规定在计算各州人口以确定其在国会众议院的代表权和税收分担时，一个奴隶按五分之三个人计算. + 
 The slave trade is agreed, uh, that it will end in 1808, but there will be a very, uh, important internal slave trade within the United States. + 
 And of course, in the Constitution, there is a Fugitive Slave Law 逃亡奴隶法 that said Southerners can go get their runaway slaves. + 


We also saw that after and following the American Revolution, many states in both the North and the middle areas—uh, for example, Pennsylvania and New York—are going to slowly abolish 废除；废止 slavery. + 
 Um, there are economic reasons for this: slavery wasn't very important or profitable 有利可图的；赚钱的 to those regions, but also ideological 意识形态的，right? You know, these inequalities 不平等 in society, uh, are becoming more and more apparent 明显的；显而易见的 when you're talking about natural rights and other things. + 
 So slavery is going to fade away 逐渐消失 from certain states. + 
 And of course, under the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例，we see slavery was banned 禁止 by the Northwest Ordinance （《西北条例》：美国 1787 年通过的一项法令，规定了西北领地的治理和发展原则）of 1787, so there was a banning of slavery north of the Ohio River in that territory—the Old Northwest. + 


We also saw that during the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协案，the issue of slavery caused a huge conflict 冲突. + 
 But ultimately 最终；最后，both sides backed down 让步；放弃立场；打退堂鼓；a truce 休战；停战协议 was reached, which will postpone 推迟；延迟 the issue of slavery to later decades. + 
 But of course, this compromise will gradually 逐渐地 break down 瓦解；失败 as confrontations 对抗；冲突 over slavery became increasingly bitter. + 
 But the Missouri Compromise is important. + 


So let's take a look at this kind of Southern society. + 
 And when you think about Southern society, you have to think about King Cotton 棉花之王. + 
 Cotton was key. + 
 The Southern economy was always reliant 依赖的；依靠的 on cash crops 经济作物，whether that be, uh, tobacco 烟草 in Virginia during the colonial times or rice in South Carolina, but also cotton. + 
 And what really kind of sets this thing off 引发；激起 like never before is Eli Whitney in the 1790s invents the cotton gin 轧棉机，which allows for this cash crop—cotton—to become very, very profitable 有利可图的；赚钱的 because one individual can separate the seeds from the cotton with this machine. + 
 And as a result of this huge increase in cotton production, there's a demand for land for cotton production, which leads to an increase—a huge increase—in the demand and the profitability 盈利能力；收益性 of slave labor. + 


And what you see is this is all being fueled 刺激；推动；促进 by the Market Revolution 市场革命. + 
 Northern industries are demanding, uh, this Southern cotton—these raw materials 原材料 —as well as England. + 
 And this is going to bring enormous 巨大的；庞大的 prosperity 繁荣；兴旺 in the textile mills 纺织厂，making really awesome 极好的；了不起的 shirts like the one you see right there. + 
 But prosperity not just for the South but also the North and England, and it's being built on the backs of slave labor. + 


And what you see is, if you take a look at maps of this time period in the 1820s, cotton production is largely, you know, along the coast in South Carolina and Georgia. + 
 But as you see as time goes on, by 1860, cotton production is moving west. + 
 And along with this increase in cotton production comes this demand for land as well as this demand for slave labor. + 
 And you have this huge internal slave trade taking place where people are moving slaves between states, especially in the Deep Southern states. + 


So here you have the slave concentration 集中；聚集 in 1820, and as you can see by 1860, there's this very, very huge percent of the population being more than 50% slave in states like South Carolina and Mississippi. + 
 Um, keep in mind, as the movement west takes place, this brings up issues, as we saw with the Missouri Compromise, over whether or not this new territory 领土；领地 will be slave or free. + 
 The Missouri Compromise is just one of these examples. + 
 You also have the Compromise of 1850 1850 年妥协案 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act 堪萨斯 - 内布拉斯加法案 of 1854. + 
 All of these will postpone 推迟；延迟 and not end the crisis 危机 that will occur between the North and South. + 


So we're going to take a look at the antebellum 战前的 South—the pre-war South. + 
 What did it look like? And a couple things: one is obviously it was a primarily agrarian 农业的；农耕的 society. + 
 Cotton is king. + 
 There's a lack of industrialization 工业化. + 
 There's really no need, if you're a Southerner, to industrialize 使工业化 because your money, your capital 资本，was invested in slave labor. + 
 So you don't have the funds 资金；经费 to industrialize, nor do you have a real desire to do so. + 


25% of the population of the South owned slaves—important point—meaning the overwhelming 压倒性的；绝大多数的 majority, three-fourths of Southern whites, owned no slaves at all. + 
 The average number of slaves that were owned was less than 10. + 
 And yet, the majority of Southerners are not slave owners, yet they support and defend the institution of slavery. + 
 And if you're asking why, well, there's a hope that they will one day own slaves, but also there's this racism 种族主义，and there's this whole social hierarchy 等级制度. + 
 And at the bottom of that social hierarchy in Southern society was, in fact, African-American slaves. + 
 And so if you were at least above some group in society, that created a sense of comfort. + 


In terms of Southern politics, it was in many ways an oligarchy 寡头政治；寡头统治集团 —meaning a government by the wealthy few. + 
 And the people who really controlled Southern politics were the plantation owners 种植园主 —those people who owned, you know, typically more than 100 slaves. + 
 The South was very undemocratic 不民主的. + 
 There was a huge gap between the rich and the poor, and it was large slaveholders 奴隶主 controlling Southern politics. + 
 They are the ones dominating 支配；控制 the legislators 立法者 of the different states. + 


In fact, if you look at Southern society, it could be broken down into these four groups among Southern whites: you have the plantation owners—they are the very wealthy, the elite 精英；上层人士，the 1%. + 
 You have number two, the small slaveholders—these are people that typically own around 10 or fewer slaves. + 
 Then you have the majority of the population, which are the yeoman farmers 自耕农 —they own no slaves at all. + 
 And at the bottom of Southern white society are the people of the pine barrens—they own no slaves, and they also own no land. + 


And then, of course, this is very different than the North. + 
 The North is industrializing 使工业化. + 
 There's a lack of immigration 移民 to the South. + 
 If you're an Irish or a German or any immigrant 移民，you're not going to go to the South because land is very expensive, and the competition is free labor. + 
 There is no real reason to immigrate 移民 to the South. + 
 And as a result, those public school reforms like Horace Mann, uh, you're not going to see that take place in the South either. + 


Um, and if you take a look at the Southern population between the whites, the slaves, and you have a free black population in some states—especially the Upper South—you could see in Delaware, 17% free African-American; Virginia, 5%. + 
 But of course, like we saw, over half the population of states like South Carolina and Mississippi are, in fact, slaves. + 
 The Deep South is going to be very reliant 依赖的；依靠的 on slave labor on these plantations 种植园. + 


Now, what do the African-American communities look like at this time? And you see a variety of experiences. + 
 One, the North: there was about 250,000 free African-Americans in the North by the time of the Civil War in 1860, and life was not good for them either. + 
 Even though there is no slavery in the North by this point in time, um, there was a lot of tension 紧张关系 with Irish immigrants, uh, with competition over low-skill jobs. + 
 You know, who's going to be getting the low-skilled jobs? Well, African-Americans and Irish immigrants are going to compete for those. + 
 Um, and as a result, you're going to see a lot of racial 种族的 tension in the North as well. + 


A lot of people are surprised that there is a free black population in the South. + 
 By 1860, it's also around 250,000 people. + 
 Many of these are African-Americans who gained their freedom, uh, many are mulatto 混血儿 —they're of mixed race—perhaps they had a white father who freed them. + 
 Uh, many were freed after the American Revolution, uh, in the South, and some, they paid, uh, for their freedom. + 
 They were able to raise money by working extra, uh, hours, and they were paid a little bit of money, and over time they were able to, uh, buy their freedom. + 


Of course, there were many restrictions 限制 on daily life for these free African-American communities, especially after Nat Turner's rebellion 叛乱 in 1831. + 
 Slavery itself—important to keep in mind—it varied from region to region, from owner to owner. + 
 There was no one experience, uh, but in all circumstances, slavery was based upon chattel slavery 动产奴隶制. + 
 Slaves were treated as property 财产. + 
 Very often, you would see families being separated; they were sold just as you would sell any piece of equipment on the farm. + 


And this really was brought to Northerners' attention with the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin—this idea of families being broken up, uh, in this institution of slavery. + 
 Um, by the eve of the Civil War, like I said, most slaves were in the Deep South—so states like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, and so on. + 
 And slaves, no matter where you were, no matter how nice or or brutal 残忍的；野蛮的 your master was, they were not afforded 给予；提供 any social, political, or civil rights 公民权利. + 
 It was illegal 非法的 to learn to read or write if you were a slave throughout the South. + 


But in spite of all this, African-American culture emerged as a blending 融合 of African and American cultural influences. + 
 Slaves developed their own culture and their own system. + 
 One of the key components 组成部分；成分 of this is the African-American religion, especially after this Second Great Awakening 第二次大觉醒. + 
 Many slaves had been converted to Christianity 基督教，but, um, what happens here is very unique. + 
 Black Christianity, especially amongst Methodists 卫理公会派教徒 and Baptists 浸礼会教徒，is going to adopt 采用；采纳，uh, African practices like the responsorial 应答轮唱的 style of preaching, drawing on West African traditions where you have this kind of, you know, back and forth between the church leaders and the members of the church. + 


And another important component of this is the importance of the black, uh, slave songs—the spirituals 灵歌 —and drawing on West African traditions in this culture. + 
 So this is a key part of this experience. + 


There is going to be enormous 巨大的；庞大的 resistance 抵抗；反抗 to slavery, and forms of resistance take, uh, different types. + 
 For instance, slowly, uh, working work slowdowns 怠工，negligence 疏忽；失职，breaking equipment, uh, was a way to rebel 反抗；造反 in a, in a kind of covert 隐蔽的；秘密的 way. + 
 There were more, uh, overt 公开的；明显的 ways of resistance, such as running away—you know, Harriet Tubman and her role with the Underground Railroad 地下铁路（美国南北战争前帮助南方黑奴逃往北方的秘密组织）. + 
 Uh, very difficult though to get away because of the large distances. + 


And slave revolts 起义；反叛 —actually rebelling. + 
 Slave revolts were not uncommon. + 
 For a number of reasons, whites had the weapons; uh, African-Americans lacked allies 盟友 in the South, but there were some. + 
 During colonial times, the biggest rebellion took place in 1739, uh, in South Carolina, as slaves tried to run away to Florida, and you have a number of whites and slaves killed during the Stono Rebellion 斯托诺起义. + 
 Eventually put down 镇压，and further restrictions put upon slaves in South Carolina and other colonies. + 


Denmark Vesey is another slave revolt. + 
 He planned it—Mr. + 
 Denmark Vesey in South Carolina again. + 
 A massive 大规模的；巨大的 revolt was planned. + 
 Uh, Vesey was a free African-American, uh, but unfortunately for Vesey, he is betrayed by informers 告密者，and he and some of his followers are, uh, killed. + 


The one rebellion that actually led to the death of Americans during the, uh, post-American Revolution period happens in 1831, and that, of course, is Nat Turner's Rebellion. + 
 Make sure you know about that. + 
 It is the only revolt in which Southern whites are killed—60 Virginians, many of them women and children. + 
 Eventually, Nat Turner himself and his followers are killed. + 


As a result of these revolts, Southerners are going to react. + 
 They're going to create harsher 更严厉的；更残酷的 laws. + 
 There were already many harsh 严厉的；残酷的 laws, but the Black Codes 黑人法典，which restricted the movement of free African-Americans in the South, and also slave patrols 奴隶巡逻队，are going to increase, hunting those individuals who have run away. + 


You're also going to see the growth of an abolitionist 废除主义者 movement, uh, as time goes on. + 
 One of the earliest opponents 反对者 of slavery were Quakers 贵格会教徒. + 
 They were opposed to not only war but also the institution of slavery, uh, during the colonial period. + 


You also get other movements like the American Colonization Society 美国殖民协会. + 
 Their whole thing was to free slaves and then send them back to Africa. + 
 And in 1822, Liberia 利比里亚，uh, was formed. + 
 They named it Monrovia 蒙罗维亚 after the president, uh, but that was never a very big movement because it wasn't very practical, and only about 12,000, uh, slaves are sent to Africa. + 
 And the reason it wasn't very practical is many of these individuals had no connection to the continent any longer. + 
 They were born in America; they were American. + 
 And the American Colonization Society, uh, ultimately 最终；最后 was a failed plan. + 


You also have many, um, African-Americans taking the lead role in the abolition movement. + 
 One of the most famous ones is David Walker, a free African-American who writes a very powerful piece of, uh, protest literature 抗议文学 in 1829 called The Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World, in which he called on African people—African-American people—to rebel in a violent uprising 起义；暴动. + 
 And his pamphlet 小册子 is banned throughout the South. + 


William Lloyd Garrison is another abolitionist. + 
 In 1833, he creates the American Anti-Slavery Society 美国反奴隶制协会，which calls for the immediate, uncompensated 无补偿的 emancipation 解放 of slaves. + 
 He publishes The Liberator （《解放者》：美国的一份反奴隶制报纸）, which is the anti-slavery newspaper. + 
 And him and his followers were very unpopular in the North and the South. + 


And of course, some of the more famous, uh, former slaves who advocate for 倡导；支持 abolitionism 废除奴隶制，uh, after they get their freedom, are people like Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. + 
 And you also see slavery kind of infecting 影响；侵蚀 politics. + 
 In 1840, you have the Liberty Party 自由党 forming, which starts to say the best way to deal with the issue of slavery is through the political process. + 
 So you have a lot of different abolitionist movements, know their different strategies 策略 and philosophies 哲学；理念. + 


And then finally, as you have this reaction and this kind of criticism of slavery from the North, you see Southerners react with the whole defense of slavery. + 
 Um, in fact, in Congress, you have the famous gag resolution 禁言决议 being imposed, which from 1836 to 1844, it was illegal—it was actually banned—to talk about slavery within Congress. + 
 There was a ban on any anti-slavery petitions 请愿书 being discussed or debated within Congress. + 
 This famously was overturned 推翻；撤销 by John Quincy Adams, uh, in 1844, and so the issue of slavery is once again discussed in the halls of Congress. + 


There are going to be bans on teaching slaves to read or write. + 
 This was seen as a path to resistance, um, so this was something that was very much enforced 执行；实施 throughout the South. + 
 And of course, um, Southern states are going to have strict slave codes 奴隶法典，especially after events like Nat Turner's revolt, because of this fear and wanting to ensure that future revolts do not, uh, materialize 实现；发生. + 


Anti-slavery messages, um, anti-slavery literature such as David Walker's Appeal or The Liberator newspaper, were banned from the South. + 
 They would not deliver it. + 


And finally, you actually get the development of a pro-slavery argument amongst Southerners, such as George Fitzhugh, John C. + 
 Calhoun, and others. + 
 And the argument comes down to this: slavery is a good thing, and this criticism of slavery is unjustified 不合理的；无正当理由的 because there's this idea that slaves are being treated as family—you know, this very paternalistic 家长式作风的；家长式统治的 view of slavery, that we're taking care of these individuals, and this is better than what is happening in the North in factories with the wage slavery 工资奴隶制 that takes place up there. + 
 The Southerners take care of their property—their slaves. + 


And then finally, there's also this kind of civilization argument—that these are inferior 低等的；劣等的 people, and that by bringing them to America—forcibly 强行地；强迫地 bringing them to America—that we are uplifting 使振奋；使受尊敬 and civilizing 使文明；教化 an inferior group. + 
 And obviously, you can see the BS 胡说；废话 in this. + 


That's going to do it for today. +

各位APUSH的同学们，大家好！今天我们要探讨美国南方以及奴隶制这种制度。如果你正在阅读任何一本APUSH教材——比如《美国 pageant》第16章或者其他两本——你会发现这次讲座会对你有所帮助。

几个关键点：不幸的是，奴隶制在美国由来已久。第一批运奴船于1619年抵达詹姆斯敦。当然，在1676年培根叛乱之后，弗吉尼亚殖民地从主要依靠契约奴役转向了黑人动产奴隶制。奴隶制是制宪会议上的一个主要问题，嗯，但结果是，制宪会议的制定者们将这个问题的解决方案——奴隶制——推迟到了以后。但我们确实有五分之三妥协方案。奴隶贸易经同意将于1808年结束，但美国国内将会存在非常重要的奴隶贸易。当然，在宪法中，有一项《逃亡奴隶法》，规定南方人可以去追捕他们的逃跑奴隶。

我们还看到，在美国独立战争之后，北方和中部地区的许多州——比如宾夕法尼亚州和纽约州——将缓慢地废除奴隶制。嗯，这有经济原因：奴隶制对这些地区来说不是很重要或有利可图，但也有意识形态上的原因，对吧？你知道，当谈论自然权利和其他事物时，社会上的这些不平等现象变得越来越明显。因此，奴隶制将从某些州逐渐消失。当然，在邦联条例下，我们看到1787年的西北法令禁止了俄亥俄河以北地区（即旧西北地区）的奴隶制。

我们还看到，在密苏里妥协案期间，奴隶制问题引起了巨大的冲突。但最终，双方都退让了；达成了一项休战协议，这将把奴隶制问题推迟到几十年后。但当然，随着围绕奴隶制的对抗变得越来越激烈，这项妥协案将逐渐瓦解。但密苏里妥协案是重要的。

现在让我们来看看这种南方社会。当你想到南方社会时，你必须想到棉花为王。棉花是关键。南方经济一直依赖于经济作物，无论是殖民时期的弗吉尼亚州的烟草，还是南卡罗来纳州的水稻，当然还有棉花。真正以前所未有的方式引发这一变革的是伊莱·惠特尼在1790年代发明了轧棉机，这使得棉花这种经济作物变得非常非常有利可图，因为一个人可以用这台机器将棉籽从棉花中分离出来。由于棉花产量的大幅增加，对棉花种植土地的需求增加，这导致了对奴隶劳动力的需求和利润的大幅增加。

你们看到这一切都是由市场革命推动的。北方工业需要南方的棉花——这些原材料——英国也需要。这将为纺织厂带来巨大的繁荣，生产出像你现在看到的这种非常棒的衬衫。但繁荣不仅属于南方，也属于北方和英国，而这一切都是建立在奴隶劳动的基础上的。

你们可以看到，如果你看一下1820年代这个时期的地图，棉花生产主要集中在南卡罗来纳州和佐治亚州的沿海地区。但是随着时间的推移，到1860年，你们可以看到棉花生产正在向西移动。伴随着棉花产量的增加，对土地和奴隶劳动力的需求也在增加。你们可以看到大规模的国内奴隶贸易正在进行，人们在各州之间，特别是在深南各州之间贩卖奴隶。

所以这里是1820年的奴隶集中分布图，你们可以看到到1860年，在南卡罗来纳州和密西西比州等州，人口中超过50%都是奴隶，这个比例非常非常高。记住，随着向西扩张的进行，正如我们在密苏里妥协案中看到的那样，这引发了关于新领土是否将成为蓄奴州或自由州的问题。密苏里妥协案只是这些例子之一。你们还有1850年妥协案和1854年的堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案。所有这些都将推迟而不会结束南北之间将要发生的危机。

现在我们来看看战前南方——内战前的南方。它是什么样的？有几件事：一是显然它主要是一个农业社会。棉花是王。缺乏工业化。如果你是南方人，真的没有必要进行工业化，因为你的钱，你的资本，都投资在奴隶劳动上了。所以你没有资金进行工业化，也没有真正的意愿这样做。

南方人口的25%拥有奴隶——重要的一点——这意味着绝大多数，四分之三的南方白人，根本没有拥有奴隶。拥有的奴隶的平均数量不到10个。然而，大多数南方人不是奴隶主，但他们支持和捍卫奴隶制这种制度。如果你问为什么，嗯，他们希望有一天能拥有奴隶，而且还存在种族主义以及整个社会等级制度。在南方社会等级制度的最底层，实际上是非裔美国奴隶。因此，如果你至少在社会上高于某个群体，这就会产生一种舒适感。

就南方政治而言，在许多方面它都是寡头政治——意味着由少数富人统治的政府。真正控制南方政治的是种植园主——那些拥有，你知道，通常超过100名奴隶的人。南方非常不民主。贫富差距巨大，控制南方政治的是大型奴隶主。他们是控制各州立法机构的人。

事实上，如果你观察南方社会，它可以分为南方白人中的四个群体：你们有种植园主——他们非常富有，是精英，占1%。你们有第二类，小奴隶主——这些人通常拥有10个或更少的奴隶。然后是人口的大多数，他们是自耕农——他们根本没有奴隶。在南方白人社会的最底层是松林地带的人——他们没有奴隶，也没有土地。

当然，这与北方非常不同。北方正在工业化。南方缺乏移民。如果你是爱尔兰人、德国人或任何移民，你都不会去南方，因为土地非常昂贵，而且竞争是自由劳动力。没有真正的理由移民到南方。结果，像霍勒斯·曼那样的公共教育改革也不会在南方发生。

嗯，如果你看一下南方白人、奴隶和一些州（尤其是上南方）的自由黑人人口，你可以看到在特拉华州，17%是非裔美国自由人；弗吉尼亚州，5%。但是，正如我们所看到的，在南卡罗来纳州和密西西比州等州，一半以上的人口实际上是奴隶。深南方将非常依赖这些种植园的奴隶劳动。

现在，当时的非裔美国人社区是什么样的？你们会看到各种各样的经历。首先是北方：到1860年内战爆发时，北方大约有25万自由非裔美国人，他们的生活也不好过。尽管此时北方已经没有奴隶制了，但是，与爱尔兰移民之间存在很多紧张关系，因为他们竞争低技能工作。你知道，谁会得到低技能工作？嗯，非裔美国人和爱尔兰移民将争夺这些工作。结果，你们也会看到北方存在很多种族紧张关系。

很多人惊讶于南方也有自由黑人人口。到1860年，这个数字也大约是25万人。他们中的许多人是通过各种方式获得自由的非裔美国人，许多人是混血人种——也许他们有一个解放了他们的白人父亲。许多人在美国独立战争后在南方获得自由，还有一些人通过工作额外的时间攒钱来赎买自己的自由。他们能够通过额外工作攒钱，他们会得到一点报酬，随着时间的推移，他们能够买回自己的自由。

当然，这些自由的非裔美国人社区的日常生活受到许多限制，尤其是在1831年纳特·特纳叛乱之后。奴隶制本身——记住这一点很重要——因地区而异，因主人而异。没有一种统一的经历，但在所有情况下，奴隶制都是基于动产奴隶制。奴隶被视为财产。你们经常会看到家庭分离；他们被像出售农场上的任何一件设备一样出售。

而《汤姆叔叔的小屋》的出版真正引起了北方人对这一点的关注——奴隶制这种制度下家庭被拆散的景象。嗯，正如我所说，在内战前夕，大多数奴隶都在深南方——比如密西西比州、阿拉巴马州、路易斯安那州、佐治亚州等等。无论你在哪里，无论你的主人多么好或多么残酷，奴隶都没有任何社会、政治或公民权利。在整个南方，奴隶学习读写是违法的。

但是尽管如此，非裔美国文化还是作为非洲和美国文化影响的融合而出现。奴隶们发展了自己的文化和自己的体系。其中一个关键组成部分是非裔美国人的宗教，尤其是在第二次大觉醒之后。许多奴隶皈依了基督教，但是，嗯，这里发生的事情非常独特。黑人基督教，尤其是在卫理公会和浸礼会中，将采用非洲的习俗，比如应答式的布道风格，借鉴西非的传统，即教会领袖和教会成员之间有这种来回的互动。

另一个重要的组成部分是黑人奴隶歌曲——灵歌——的重要性，以及在这种文化中借鉴西非的传统。所以这是这种经历的关键部分。

对奴隶制将存在巨大的抵抗，抵抗的形式多种多样。例如，缓慢地工作，偷懒，损坏设备，是一种以隐蔽方式反抗的方式。还有更公开的反抗方式，比如逃跑——你知道，哈丽特·塔布曼和她在地下铁路中的作用。然而，由于距离遥远，逃跑非常困难。

而奴隶起义——实际上是反叛。奴隶起义并不少见。由于多种原因，白人拥有武器；非裔美国人在南方缺乏盟友，但也有一些。在殖民时期，最大的叛乱发生在1739年南卡罗来纳州，当时奴隶试图逃往佛罗里达，在斯托诺叛乱期间，许多白人和奴隶被杀。叛乱最终被镇压，南卡罗来纳州和其他殖民地对奴隶施加了进一步的限制。

丹麦·维西是另一次奴隶起义。他策划了这次起义——又是南卡罗来纳州的丹麦·维西先生。一场大规模的起义被计划出来。维西是一个自由的非裔美国人，但不幸的是，维西被告密者出卖，他和一些追随者被杀害。

在美国独立战争后时期，唯一一次导致美国人死亡的叛乱发生在1831年，那当然是纳特·特纳叛乱。务必了解那次叛乱。那是唯一一次南方白人被杀害的叛乱——60名弗吉尼亚人，其中许多是妇女和儿童。最终，纳特·特纳本人和他的追随者都被杀害。

由于这些叛乱，南方人将做出反应。他们将制定更严厉的法律。当时已经有很多严厉的法律，但是限制南方自由非裔美国人行动的黑人法典，以及奴隶巡逻队，将会增加，他们会搜捕那些逃跑的人。

随着时间的推移，你们还将看到废奴运动的兴起。最早反对奴隶制的人之一是贵格会。在殖民时期，他们不仅反对战争，也反对奴隶制这种制度。

你们还会看到其他运动，比如美国殖民协会。他们的全部目标是解放奴隶，然后将他们送回非洲。1822年，利比里亚成立了。他们以总统的名字将其命名为蒙罗维亚，但这从来都不是一个很大的运动，因为它不是很实际，只有大约12000名奴隶被送往非洲。它不是很实际的原因是，这些人中的许多人与非洲大陆已经没有任何联系了。他们出生在美国；他们是美国人。美国殖民协会最终是一个失败的计划。

你们还有许多非裔美国人在废奴运动中发挥主导作用。其中最著名的是大卫·沃克，一位自由的非裔美国人，他在1829年写了一篇非常有力的抗议文学作品，名为《呼吁世界有色公民》，其中他呼吁非洲人——非裔美国人——进行暴力起义。他的小册子在整个南方都被禁止。

威廉·劳埃德·加里森是另一位废奴主义者。1833年，他创建了美国反奴隶制协会，该协会呼吁立即无偿解放奴隶。他出版了《解放者报》，这是一份反奴隶制的报纸。他和他的追随者在南方和北方都非常不受欢迎。

当然，一些更著名的、获得自由后倡导废奴主义的前奴隶，比如弗雷德里克·道格拉斯和索杰纳·特鲁思。你们还看到奴隶制开始影响政治。1840年，自由党成立，他们开始认为解决奴隶制问题的最佳方式是通过政治进程。所以你们有很多不同的废奴运动，要了解他们不同的策略和理念。

最后，当你们看到北方对奴隶制的这种反应和批评时，你们会看到南方人用对奴隶制的全面辩护来回应。事实上，在国会中，你们看到了著名的“禁言议案”的实施，从1836年到1844年，在国会内谈论奴隶制是非法的——实际上是被禁止的。任何在国会内讨论或辩论反奴隶制请愿书都被禁止。约翰·昆西·亚当斯在1844年推翻了这一议案，因此奴隶制问题再次在国会大厅被讨论。

教授奴隶读写将被禁止。这被认为是反抗的途径，因此在整个南方都非常严格地执行这一禁令。当然，南方各州将制定严格的奴隶法典，尤其是在像纳特·特纳叛乱这样的事件之后，因为他们害怕并希望确保未来的叛乱不会发生。

反奴隶制信息，反奴隶制文学，比如大卫·沃克的《呼吁》或《解放者报》，在南方被禁止。他们不会派送这些出版物。

最后，你们实际上看到了南方人之间亲奴隶制论点的形成，比如乔治·菲茨休、约翰·C·卡尔霍恩和其他人。他们的论点归结为：奴隶制是好事，对奴隶制的批评是不公正的，因为有一种观点认为奴隶被当作家人对待——你知道，这种非常家长式的奴隶制观点，即我们在照顾这些人，这比北方工厂里发生的工资奴隶制要好。南方人照顾他们的财产——他们的奴隶。

最后，还有一种文明论——这些人是劣等人，通过将他们带到美国——强行将他们带到美国——我们正在提升和文明化一个劣等群体。显然，你们可以看出其中的荒谬之处。

What's going down, APUSH people? Today we're going to take a look at the South and the institution of slavery. If you're reading any of those APUSH books—American Pageant chapter 16 or the other two—you see this lecture is going to help you out.

So, couple key things: slavery in America's been going on unfortunately. The first slave ships come in 1619 to Jamestown, and of course, with Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, the colony of Virginia shifts from primarily indentured servants to Black chattel slavery. Slavery was a major issue at the Constitutional Convention, um, but what happens is the framers of the Constitution postpone a solution to this problem—slavery—until later on. But we do have the Three-Fifths Compromise. The slave trade is agreed, uh, that it will end in 1808, but there will be a very, uh, important internal slave trade within the United States. And of course, in the Constitution, there is a Fugitive Slave Law that said Southerners can go get their runaway slaves.

We also saw that after and following the American Revolution, many states in both the North and the middle areas—uh, for example, Pennsylvania and New York—are going to slowly abolish slavery. Um, there are economic reasons for this: slavery wasn't very important or profitable to those regions, but also ideological, right? You know, these inequalities in society, uh, are becoming more and more apparent when you're talking about natural rights and other things. So slavery is going to fade away from certain states. And of course, under the Articles of Confederation, we see slavery was banned by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, so there was a banning of slavery north of the Ohio River in that territory—the Old Northwest.

We also saw that during the Missouri Compromise, the issue of slavery caused a huge conflict. But ultimately, both sides backed down; a truce was reached, which will postpone the issue of slavery to later decades. But of course, this compromise will gradually break down as confrontations over slavery became increasingly bitter. But the Missouri Compromise is important.

So let's take a look at this kind of Southern society. And when you think about Southern society, you have to think about King Cotton. Cotton was key. The Southern economy was always reliant on cash crops, whether that be, uh, tobacco in Virginia during the colonial times or rice in South Carolina, but also cotton. And what really kind of sets this thing off like never before is Eli Whitney in the 1790s invents the cotton gin, which allows for this cash crop—cotton—to become very, very profitable because one individual can separate the seeds from the cotton with this machine. And as a result of this huge increase in cotton production, there's a demand for land for cotton production, which leads to an increase—a huge increase—in the demand and the profitability of slave labor.

And what you see is this is all being fueled by the Market Revolution. Northern industries are demanding, uh, this Southern cotton—these raw materials—as well as England. And this is going to bring enormous prosperity in the textile mills, making really awesome shirts like the one you see right there. But prosperity not just for the South but also the North and England, and it's being built on the backs of slave labor.

And what you see is, if you take a look at maps of this time period in the 1820s, cotton production is largely, you know, along the coast in South Carolina and Georgia. But as you see as time goes on, by 1860, cotton production is moving west. And along with this increase in cotton production comes this demand for land as well as this demand for slave labor. And you have this huge internal slave trade taking place where people are moving slaves between states, especially in the Deep Southern states.

So here you have the slave concentration in 1820, and as you can see by 1860, there's this very, very huge percent of the population being more than 50% slave in states like South Carolina and Mississippi. Um, keep in mind, as the movement west takes place, this brings up issues, as we saw with the Missouri Compromise, over whether or not this new territory will be slave or free. The Missouri Compromise is just one of these examples. You also have the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. All of these will postpone and not end the crisis that will occur between the North and South.

So we're going to take a look at the antebellum South—the pre-war South. What did it look like? And a couple things: one is obviously it was a primarily agrarian society. Cotton is king. There's a lack of industrialization. There's really no need, if you're a Southerner, to industrialize because your money, your capital, was invested in slave labor. So you don't have the funds to industrialize, nor do you have a real desire to do so.

25% of the population of the South owned slaves—important point—meaning the overwhelming majority, three-fourths of Southern whites, owned no slaves at all. The average number of slaves that were owned was less than 10. And yet, the majority of Southerners are not slave owners, yet they support and defend the institution of slavery. And if you're asking why, well, there's a hope that they will one day own slaves, but also there's this racism, and there's this whole social hierarchy. And at the bottom of that social hierarchy in Southern society was, in fact, African-American slaves. And so if you were at least above some group in society, that created a sense of comfort.

In terms of Southern politics, it was in many ways an oligarchy—meaning a government by the wealthy few. And the people who really controlled Southern politics were the plantation owners—those people who owned, you know, typically more than 100 slaves. The South was very undemocratic. There was a huge gap between the rich and the poor, and it was large slaveholders controlling Southern politics. They are the ones dominating the legislators of the different states.

In fact, if you look at Southern society, it could be broken down into these four groups among Southern whites: you have the plantation owners—they are the very wealthy, the elite, the 1%. You have number two, the small slaveholders—these are people that typically own around 10 or fewer slaves. Then you have the majority of the population, which are the yeoman farmers—they own no slaves at all. And at the bottom of Southern white society are the people of the pine barrens—they own no slaves, and they also own no land.

And then, of course, this is very different than the North. The North is industrializing. There's a lack of immigration to the South. If you're an Irish or a German or any immigrant, you're not going to go to the South because land is very expensive, and the competition is free labor. There is no real reason to immigrate to the South. And as a result, those public school reforms like Horace Mann, uh, you're not going to see that take place in the South either.

Um, and if you take a look at the Southern population between the whites, the slaves, and you have a free black population in some states—especially the Upper South—you could see in Delaware, 17% free African-American; Virginia, 5%. But of course, like we saw, over half the population of states like South Carolina and Mississippi are, in fact, slaves. The Deep South is going to be very reliant on slave labor on these plantations.

Now, what do the African-American communities look like at this time? And you see a variety of experiences. One, the North: there was about 250,000 free African-Americans in the North by the time of the Civil War in 1860, and life was not good for them either. Even though there is no slavery in the North by this point in time, um, there was a lot of tension with Irish immigrants, uh, with competition over low-skill jobs. You know, who's going to be getting the low-skilled jobs? Well, African-Americans and Irish immigrants are going to compete for those. Um, and as a result, you're going to see a lot of racial tension in the North as well.

A lot of people are surprised that there is a free black population in the South. By 1860, it's also around 250,000 people. Many of these are African-Americans who gained their freedom, uh, many are mulatto—they're of mixed race—perhaps they had a white father who freed them. Uh, many were freed after the American Revolution, uh, in the South, and some, they paid, uh, for their freedom. They were able to raise money by working extra, uh, hours, and they were paid a little bit of money, and over time they were able to, uh, buy their freedom.

Of course, there were many restrictions on daily life for these free African-American communities, especially after Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831. Slavery itself—important to keep in mind—it varied from region to region, from owner to owner. There was no one experience, uh, but in all circumstances, slavery was based upon chattel slavery. Slaves were treated as property. Very often, you would see families being separated; they were sold just as you would sell any piece of equipment on the farm.

And this really was brought to Northerners' attention with the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin—this idea of families being broken up, uh, in this institution of slavery. Um, by the eve of the Civil War, like I said, most slaves were in the Deep South—so states like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, and so on. And slaves, no matter where you were, no matter how nice or or brutal your master was, they were not afforded any social, political, or civil rights. It was illegal to learn to read or write if you were a slave throughout the South.

But in spite of all this, African-American culture emerged as a blending of African and American cultural influences. Slaves developed their own culture and their own system. One of the key components of this is the African-American religion, especially after this Second Great Awakening. Many slaves had been converted to Christianity, but, um, what happens here is very unique. Black Christianity, especially amongst Methodists and Baptists, is going to adopt, uh, African practices like the responsorial style of preaching, drawing on West African traditions where you have this kind of, you know, back and forth between the church leaders and the members of the church.

And another important component of this is the importance of the black, uh, slave songs—the spirituals—and drawing on West African traditions in this culture. So this is a key part of this experience.

There is going to be enormous resistance to slavery, and forms of resistance take, uh, different types. For instance, slowly, uh, working work slowdowns, negligence, breaking equipment, uh, was a way to rebel in a, in a kind of covert way. There were more, uh, overt ways of resistance, such as running away—you know, Harriet Tubman and her role with the Underground Railroad. Uh, very difficult though to get away because of the large distances.

And slave revolts—actually rebelling. Slave revolts were not uncommon. For a number of reasons, whites had the weapons; uh, African-Americans lacked allies in the South, but there were some. During colonial times, the biggest rebellion took place in 1739, uh, in South Carolina, as slaves tried to run away to Florida, and you have a number of whites and slaves killed during the Stono Rebellion. Eventually put down, and further restrictions put upon slaves in South Carolina and other colonies.

Denmark Vesey is another slave revolt. He planned it—Mr. Denmark Vesey in South Carolina again. A massive revolt was planned. Uh, Vesey was a free African-American, uh, but unfortunately for Vesey, he is betrayed by informers, and he and some of his followers are, uh, killed.

The one rebellion that actually led to the death of Americans during the, uh, post-American Revolution period happens in 1831, and that, of course, is Nat Turner's Rebellion. Make sure you know about that. It is the only revolt in which Southern whites are killed—60 Virginians, many of them women and children. Eventually, Nat Turner himself and his followers are killed.

As a result of these revolts, Southerners are going to react. They're going to create harsher laws. There were already many harsh laws, but the Black Codes, which restricted the movement of free African-Americans in the South, and also slave patrols, are going to increase, hunting those individuals who have run away.

You're also going to see the growth of an abolitionist movement, uh, as time goes on. One of the earliest opponents of slavery were Quakers. They were opposed to not only war but also the institution of slavery, uh, during the colonial period.

You also get other movements like the American Colonization Society. Their whole thing was to free slaves and then send them back to Africa. And in 1822, Liberia, uh, was formed. They named it Monrovia after the president, uh, but that was never a very big movement because it wasn't very practical, and only about 12,000, uh, slaves are sent to Africa. And the reason it wasn't very practical is many of these individuals had no connection to the continent any longer. They were born in America; they were American. And the American Colonization Society, uh, ultimately was a failed plan.

You also have many, um, African-Americans taking the lead role in the abolition movement. One of the most famous ones is David Walker, a free African-American who writes a very powerful piece of, uh, protest literature in 1829 called The Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World, in which he called on African people—African-American people—to rebel in a violent uprising. And his pamphlet is banned throughout the South.

William Lloyd Garrison is another abolitionist. In 1833, he creates the American Anti-Slavery Society, which calls for the immediate, uncompensated emancipation of slaves. He publishes The Liberator, which is the anti-slavery newspaper. And him and his followers were very unpopular in the North and the South.

And of course, some of the more famous, uh, former slaves who advocate for abolitionism, uh, after they get their freedom, are people like Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. And you also see slavery kind of infecting politics. In 1840, you have the Liberty Party forming, which starts to say the best way to deal with the issue of slavery is through the political process. So you have a lot of different abolitionist movements, know their different strategies and philosophies.

And then finally, as you have this reaction and this kind of criticism of slavery from the North, you see Southerners react with the whole defense of slavery. Um, in fact, in Congress, you have the famous gag resolution being imposed, which from 1836 to 1844, it was illegal—it was actually banned—to talk about slavery within Congress. There was a ban on any anti-slavery petitions being discussed or debated within Congress. This famously was overturned by John Quincy Adams, uh, in 1844, and so the issue of slavery is once again discussed in the halls of Congress.

There are going to be bans on teaching slaves to read or write. This was seen as a path to resistance, um, so this was something that was very much enforced throughout the South. And of course, um, Southern states are going to have strict slave codes, especially after events like Nat Turner's revolt, because of this fear and wanting to ensure that future revolts do not, uh, materialize.

Anti-slavery messages, um, anti-slavery literature such as David Walker's Appeal or The Liberator newspaper, were banned from the South. They would not deliver it.

And finally, you actually get the development of a pro-slavery argument amongst Southerners, such as George Fitzhugh, John C. Calhoun, and others. And the argument comes down to this: slavery is a good thing, and this criticism of slavery is unjustified because there's this idea that slaves are being treated as family—you know, this very paternalistic view of slavery, that we're taking care of these individuals, and this is better than what is happening in the North in factories with the wage slavery that takes place up there. The Southerners take care of their property—their slaves.

And then finally, there's also this kind of civilization argument—that these are inferior people, and that by bringing them to America—forcibly bringing them to America—that we are uplifting and civilizing an inferior group. And obviously, you can see the BS in this.

That's going to do it for today. Hopefully, you learned some stuff. Subscribe to the channel, click like if it helped you at all, tell your friends, and happy studying. Peace.
