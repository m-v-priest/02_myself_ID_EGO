== 释义

what’s going down APUSH people? today we’re going to take a look at the South and the institution of slavery 奴隶制. if you’re reading any of those APUSH books - American Pageant chapter 16 or the other two - this lecture is going to help you out.

so couple key things: slavery in America’s been going on unfortunately - the first slave ships come in 1619 to Jamestown, and of course with Bacon’s Rebellion 培根叛乱 in 1676, the colony of Virginia shifts from primarily indentured servants 契约仆人 to Black chattel slavery 黑人动产奴隶制. slavery was a major issue at the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议，but what happens is the framers of the Constitution postpone a solution to this problem (slavery) until later on. but we do have: - the three - fifths compromise 五分之三妥协案 - the slave trade is agreed that it will end in 1808 (but there will be a very important internal slave trade 国内奴隶贸易 within the United States) - and of course in the Constitution there is a fugitive slave law 逃奴法 that said Southerners can go get their runaway slaves.

we also saw that after and following the American Revolution 美国独立战争，many states in both the North and the middle areas (for example Pennsylvania and New York) are going to slowly abolish slavery 废除奴隶制. there is economic reasons for this (slavery wasn’t very important or profitable to those regions) but also ideological - right, you know these inequalities in society are becoming more and more apparent when you’re talking about natural rights 自然权利 and other things. so slavery is going to fade away from certain states.

and of course under the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例，we see slavery was banned by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 1787 年西北条例 - so there was a banning of slavery north of the Ohio River in that territory (the old Northwest).

we also saw that during the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协案，the issue of slavery caused a huge conflict. but ultimately both sides backed down - a truce 休战 was reached which will postpone the issue of slavery to later decades. but of course this compromise will gradually break down as confrontations over slavery became increasingly bitter. but the Missouri Compromise is important.

so let’s take a look at this kind of Southern society. and when you think about Southern society, you have to think about King Cotton 棉花之王. cotton was key - the Southern economy was always reliant on cash crops 经济作物，whether that be tobacco in Virginia during the colonial times or rice in South Carolina, but also cotton. and what really kind of sets this thing off like never before is Eli Whitney in the 1790s invents the cotton gin 轧棉机，which allows for this cash crop (cotton) to become very very profitable because one individual can separate the seeds from the cotton with this machine.

and as a result of this huge increase in cotton production: - there’s a demand for land for cotton production - which leads to an increase (a huge increase) in the demand and the profitability of slave labor - and what you see is this is all being fueled by the Market Revolution 市场革命 - Northern industries are demanding this Southern cotton (these raw materials), as well as England - and this is going to bring enormous prosperity in the textile mills 纺织厂 (making really awesome shirts like the one you see right there), but prosperity not just for the South but also the North and England - and it’s being built on the backs of slave labor.

and what you see is if you take a look at maps of this time period - in the 1820s, cotton production is largely along the coast in South Carolina and Georgia, but as you see as time goes on by 1860, cotton production is moving West. and along with this increase in cotton production comes this demand for land as well as this demand for slave labor, and you have this huge internal slave trade taking place where people are moving slaves between states, especially in the Deep South states.

so here you have the slave concentration in 1820, and as you can see by 1860, there’s this very very huge percent of the population being more than 50% slave in states like South Carolina and Mississippi.

keep in mind as the movement West takes place, this brings up issues (as we saw with the Missouri Compromise) over whether or not this new territory will be slave or free. the Missouri Compromise is just one of these examples - you also have the Compromise of 1850 1850 年妥协案 and the Kansas - Nebraska Act of 1854 1854 年堪萨斯 - 内布拉斯加法案. all of these will postpone and not end the crisis that will occur between the North and South.

so we’re going to take a look at the antebellum South (the pre - war South) - what did it look like? and a couple things: 1. obviously it was a primarily agrarian society 农业社会 - cotton is king 2. there’s a lack of industrialization 工业化 - there’s really no need if you’re a Southerner to industrialize because your money (your capital) was invested in slave labor, so you don’t have the funds to industrialize nor do you have a real desire to do so 3. 25% of the population of the South owned slaves (important point) - meaning the overwhelming majority (3/4) of Southern whites owned no slaves at all. the average number of slaves that were owned was less than 10. and yet the majority of Southerners are not slave owners, yet they support and defend the institution of slavery. and if you’re asking why - well, there’s a hope that they will one day own slaves, but also there’s this racism and there’s this whole social hierarchy 社会等级制度，and at the bottom of that social hierarchy in Southern society was in fact African - American slaves. and so if you were at least above some group in society, that created a sense of comfort.

in terms of Southern politics, it was in many ways an oligarchy 寡头政治 - meaning a government by the wealthy few. and the people who really controlled Southern politics were the plantation owners - those people who owned (typically) more than 100 slaves. the South was very undemocratic - there was a huge gap between the rich and the poor, and it was large slaveholders controlling Southern politics. they are the ones dominating the legislators of the different states.

in fact, if you look at Southern society, it could be broken down into these four groups among Southern whites: 1. the plantation owners - they are the very wealthy, the elite (the 1%) 2. the small slaveholders - these are people that typically own around 10 or fewer slaves 3. the majority of the population - the yeoman farmers 自耕农 (they own no slaves at all) 4. at the bottom of Southern white society are the people of the pine barrens 松林贫瘠地区居民 - they own no slaves and they also own no land

and then of course, this is very different than the North - the North is industrializing. there’s a lack of immigration to the South - if you’re an Irish or a German or any immigrant, you’re not going to go to the South because land is very expensive and the competition is free labor. there is no real reason to immigrate to the South, and as a result those public school reforms like Horace Mann, you’re not going to see that take place in the South either.

and if you take a look at the Southern population between the whites, the slaves, and you have a free black population in some states (especially the Upper South), you could see in Delaware 17% free African - American, Virginia 5%, but of course like we saw over half the population of states like South Carolina and Mississippi are in fact slaves. the Deep South is going to be very reliant on slave labor on these plantations.

now what do the African - American communities look like at this time? and you see a variety of experiences: 1. in the North, there was about 250,000 free African - Americans in the North by the time of the Civil War in 1860, and life was not good for them either. even though there is no slavery in the North by this point in time, there was a lot of tension with Irish immigrants with competition over low - skill jobs (you know who’s going to be getting the low - skilled jobs - well African - Americans and Irish immigrants are going to compete for those). and as a result you’re going to see a lot of racial tension in the North as well. 2. a lot of people are surprised that there is a free black population in the South - by 1860 it’s also around 250,000 people. many of these are African - Americans who gained their freedom - many are mulatto 混血儿 (they’re of mixed race - perhaps they had a white father who freed them). many were freed after the American Revolution in the South, and some they paid for their freedom - they were able to raise money by working extra hours and they were paid a little bit of money, and over time they were able to buy their freedom. of course there were many restrictions on daily life for these free African - American communities, especially after Nat Turner’s rebellion 纳特・特纳起义 in 1831.

slavery itself - important to keep in mind - it varied from region to region, from owner to owner. there was no one experience, but in all circumstances slavery was based upon chattel slavery - slaves were treated as property. very often you would see families being separated - they were sold just as you would sell any piece of equipment on the farm. and this really was brought to Northerners' attention with the publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin 《汤姆叔叔的小屋》- this idea of families being broken up in this institution of slavery.

by the eve of the Civil War (like I said) most slaves were in the Deep South - so states like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia and so on. and slaves - no matter where you were, no matter how nice or brutal your master was - they were not afforded any social, political or civil rights. it was illegal to learn to read or write if you were a slave throughout the South.

but in spite of all this, African - American culture emerged as a blending of African and American cultural influences. slaves developed their own culture and their own system. one of the key components of this is the African - American religion, especially after this Second Great Awakening - many slaves had been converted to Christianity, but what happens here is very unique - black Christianity, especially amongst Methodists and Baptists, is going to adopt African practices like the responsorial style of preaching 呼应式布道 (drawing on West African traditions) where you have this kind of back and forth between the church leaders and the members of the church. and another important component of this is the importance of the black slave songs (the spirituals 圣歌) and drawing on West African traditions in this culture. so this is key part of this experience.

there is going to be enormous resistance to slavery, and forms of resistance take different types: - for instance, slowly working (work slowdowns), negligence 疏忽，breaking equipment was a way to rebel in a kind of covert way 隐蔽方式 - there were more overt ways of resistance such as running away (you know Harriet Tubman and her role with the Underground Railroad 地下铁路) - very difficult though to get away because of the large distances - and slave revolts (actually rebelling). slave revolts were not uncommon, but for a number of reasons (whites had the weapons, African - Americans lacked allies in the South) they rarely succeeded.

but there were some: - during colonial times, the biggest rebellion took place in 1739 in South Carolina as slaves tried to run away to Florida (and you have a number of whites and slaves killed during the Stono Rebellion 斯托诺叛乱) - eventually put down and further restrictions put upon slaves in South Carolina and other colonies - Denmark Vesey is another slave revolt - he planned it (Mr. Denmark Vesey in South Carolina again) - a massive revolt was planned. Vesey was a free African - American, but unfortunately for Vesey he is betrayed by informers and he and some of his followers are killed - the one rebellion that actually led to the death of Americans during the post - American Revolution period happens in 1831, and that of course is Nat Turner’s Rebellion (make sure you know about that). it is the only revolt in which Southern whites are killed - 60 Virginians (many of them women and children) are killed. eventually Nat Turner himself and his followers are killed.

as a result of these revolts, Southerners are going to react - they’re going to create harsher laws. there were already many harsh laws, but the Black Codes 黑人法典 (which restricted the movement of free African - Americans in the South) and also slave patrols 奴隶巡逻队 are going to increase hunting those individuals who have run away.

you’re also going to see the growth of an abolitionist movement 废奴运动 as time goes on: - one of the earliest opponents of slavery were Quakers 贵格会教徒 - they were opposed to not only war but also the institution of slavery during the colonial period - you also get other movements like the American Colonization Society 美国殖民协会 - their whole thing was to free slaves and then send them back to Africa. and in 1822, Liberia 利比里亚 was formed - they name its capital Monrovia 蒙罗维亚 after the president (James Monroe). but that was never a very big movement because it wasn’t very practical, and only about 12,000 slaves are sent to Africa. and the reason it wasn’t very practical is many of these individuals had no connection to the continent any longer - they were born in America, they were American, and the American Colonization Society ultimately was a failed plan - you also have many African - Americans taking the lead role in the abolition movement. one of the most famous ones is David Walker - a free African - American who writes a very powerful piece of protest literature in 1829 called "Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World" 《向全世界有色公民的呼吁》in which he called on African - American people to rebel in a violent uprising. and his pamphlet is banned throughout the South - William Lloyd Garrison is another abolitionist - in 1833 he creates the American Anti - Slavery Society 美国反奴隶制协会 which calls for the immediate uncompensated emancipation 立即无偿解放 of slaves. he publishes "The Liberator" 《解放者》which is the anti - slavery newspaper, and him and his followers were very unpopular in the North and the South - and of course some of the more famous former slaves who advocate for abolitionism after they get their freedom are people like Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth - and you also see slavery kind of infecting politics - in 1840 you have the Liberty Party 自由党 forming which starts to say the best way to deal with the issue of slavery is through the political process. so you get a lot of different abolitionist movements with different strategies and philosophies.

and then finally, as you have this reaction and this kind of criticism of slavery from the North, you see Southerners react with this whole defense of slavery: - in fact in Congress you have the famous gag resolution 禁言决议 being imposed which from 1836 to 1844 - it was illegal (it was actually banned) to talk about slavery within Congress. there was a ban on any anti - slavery petitions 反奴隶制请愿书 being discussed or debated within Congress. this famously was overturned by John Quincy Adams in 1844, and so the issue of slavery is once again discussed in the halls of Congress - there are going to be bans on teaching slaves to read or write - this was seen as a path to resistance, so this was something that was very much enforced throughout the South - and of course Southern states are going to have strict slave codes 奴隶法典，especially after events like Nat Turner’s revolt, because of this fear and wanting to ensure that future revolts do not materialize - anti - slavery messages and anti - slavery literature (such as David Walker’s "Appeal" or "The Liberator" newspaper) were banned from the South - they would not deliver it - and finally you actually get the development of a pro - slavery argument amongst Southerners such as George Fitzhugh, John C. Calhoun and others. and the argument comes down to this: * slavery is a good thing * this criticism of slavery is unjustified * there’s this idea that slaves are being treated as family (this very paternalistic view of slavery - that we’re taking care of these individuals) * and this is better than what is happening in the North in factories with the wage slavery 工资奴隶制 that takes place up there - the Southerners take care of their property (their slaves) * and then finally there’s also this kind of civilization argument - that these are inferior people and that by bringing them to America (forcibly bringing them to America) that we are uplifting and civilizing an inferior group. and obviously you can see the BS in this.

that’s going to do it for today. hopefully you learned some stuff. subscribe to the channel, click like if it helped you at all, tell your friends, and happy studying. peace.

好的，各位APUSH的同学们，今天我们要探讨南方和奴隶制机构。如果你正在阅读那些APUSH书籍——《美国纪事》第16章或其他两本——这次讲座将对你有所帮助。

几个关键点：不幸的是，美国的奴隶制由来已久——第一批运奴船于1619年抵达詹姆斯敦，当然，随着1676年的培根叛乱，弗吉尼亚殖民地从主要使用契约奴转向黑人动产奴隶制。奴隶制是制宪会议上的一个主要问题，但结果是宪法的制定者将这个问题（奴隶制）的解决方案推迟到了以后。但我们确实有：——五分之三妥协——同意奴隶贸易将于1808年结束（但美国国内将存在非常重要的奴隶贸易）——当然，宪法中有一项逃奴法，规定南方人可以去抓捕他们的逃跑奴隶。

我们还看到，在美国革命之后，北方和中部地区的许多州（例如宾夕法尼亚州和纽约州）将缓慢地废除奴隶制。这有经济原因（奴隶制对这些地区不是很重要或有利可图），但也有意识形态原因——是的，当你谈论自然权利和其他事物时，社会中的这些不平等变得越来越明显。因此，奴隶制将从某些州逐渐消失。

当然，在邦联条例下，我们看到1787年的西北法令禁止了奴隶制——因此，在该地区（旧西北部），俄亥俄河以北的地区禁止奴隶制。

我们还看到，在密苏里妥协案期间，奴隶制问题引起了巨大的冲突。但最终双方都退让了——达成了一项休战协议，将奴隶制问题推迟到几十年后。但当然，随着围绕奴隶制的对抗变得越来越激烈，这项妥协将逐渐瓦解。但密苏里妥协案非常重要。

因此，让我们来看看这种南方社会。当你想到南方社会时，你必须想到棉花为王。棉花是关键——南方经济始终依赖经济作物，无论是殖民时期的弗吉尼亚州的烟草，还是南卡罗来纳州的水稻，当然还有棉花。真正前所未有地引发这一局面的是，伊莱·惠特尼在1790年代发明了轧棉机，这使得这种经济作物（棉花）变得非常有利可图，因为一个人可以用这台机器将棉籽从棉花中分离出来。

由于棉花产量的大幅增加：——对棉花生产的土地需求增加——导致对奴隶劳动力的需求和盈利能力大幅增加——你看到这一切都受到市场革命的推动——北方工业需要南方的棉花（这些原材料），英国也需要——这将给纺织厂带来巨大的繁荣（生产出像你右边看到的那种非常棒的衬衫），但这不仅是南方的繁荣，也是北方和英国的繁荣——而这一切都建立在奴隶劳动的背脊上。

你所看到的是，如果你看一下那个时期的地图——在1820年代，棉花生产主要集中在南卡罗来纳州和佐治亚州的沿海地区，但正如你所看到的，随着时间的推移，到1860年，棉花生产正在向西转移。随着棉花产量的增加，对土地和奴隶劳动力的需求也在增加，你看到了大规模的国内奴隶贸易，人们在各州之间转移奴隶，尤其是在深南部的各州。

这是1820年的奴隶集中分布图，正如你所看到的，到1860年，在南卡罗来纳州和密西西比州等州，超过50%的人口是奴隶，这个比例非常非常高。

记住，随着西进运动的进行，这带来了问题（正如我们在密苏里妥协案中看到的那样），即这些新领土将是蓄奴州还是自由州。密苏里妥协案只是其中一个例子——你还有1850年妥协案和1854年的堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案。所有这些都将推迟而不会结束南北之间将发生的危机。

因此，我们将考察内战前的南方（战前南方）——它是什么样的？几点：1. 显然，它主要是一个农业社会——棉花为王。2. 缺乏工业化——如果你是南方人，真的没有工业化的必要，因为你的钱（你的资本）都投资在奴隶劳动力上，所以你没有资金进行工业化，也没有真正的意愿这样做。3. 南方人口的25%拥有奴隶（重要的一点）——这意味着绝大多数（四分之三）的南方白人根本没有奴隶。平均拥有的奴隶数量不到10个。然而，大多数南方人不是奴隶主，但他们支持和捍卫奴隶制。如果你问为什么——嗯，他们希望有一天能拥有奴隶，而且存在种族主义和整个社会等级制度，而南方社会等级制度的底层实际上是非裔美国奴隶。因此，如果你至少高于社会中的某个群体，那就会产生一种舒适感。

就南方政治而言，它在许多方面都是寡头政治——意味着少数富人统治的政府。真正控制南方政治的是种植园主——那些拥有（通常）超过100名奴隶的人。南方非常不民主——贫富差距巨大，控制南方政治的是那些拥有大量奴隶的人。他们控制着不同州的立法机构。

事实上，如果你看看南方社会，它可以分为南方白人中的这四个群体：

1. 种植园主——他们非常富有，是精英（1%）。
2. 小奴隶主——这些人通常拥有大约10个或更少的奴隶。
3. 大多数人口——自耕农（他们根本没有奴隶）。
4. 在南方白人社会的最底层是松林荒地的人——他们没有奴隶，也没有土地。

当然，这与北方非常不同——北方正在工业化。南方缺乏移民——如果你是爱尔兰人、德国人或任何移民，你都不会去南方，因为土地非常昂贵，而且竞争是免费劳动力。没有真正的理由移民到南方，因此，像霍勒斯·曼这样的公共教育改革也不会在南方发生。

如果你看一下南方人口中白人、奴隶的比例，并且在一些州（尤其是上南方地区）有自由黑人人口，你可以看到在特拉华州，17%是非裔美国自由人，弗吉尼亚州是5%，但当然，正如我们所看到的，在南卡罗来纳州和密西西比州等州，超过一半的人口实际上是奴隶。深南部地区将非常依赖这些种植园的奴隶劳动力。

那么，当时的非裔美国人社区是什么样的呢？你看到了各种各样的经历：

1. 在北方，到1860年内战爆发时，大约有25万非裔美国自由人，但他们的生活也不好过。尽管到那时北方已经没有奴隶制了，但由于低技能工作的竞争，与爱尔兰移民之间存在很多紧张关系（你知道谁会得到低技能工作——嗯，非裔美国人和爱尔兰移民将争夺这些工作）。因此，你也会在北方看到很多种族紧张关系。

2. 很多人惊讶于南方有自由黑人人口——到1860年，人数也大约是25万。这些人中的许多是非裔美国人，他们获得了自由——许多是混血儿（他们是混血——也许他们有一个解放了他们的白人父亲）。许多人在美国革命后在南方获得自由，有些人则花钱赎回了自己的自由——他们能够通过加班工作攒钱，并获得少量报酬，随着时间的推移，他们能够买回自己的自由。当然，这些非裔美国自由人社区的日常生活有很多限制，尤其是在1831年纳特·特纳的叛乱之后。

奴隶制本身——重要的是要记住——它因地区、因主人而异。没有一种统一的经历，但在所有情况下，奴隶制都基于动产奴隶制——奴隶被视为财产。你经常会看到家庭分离——他们被像农场上的任何设备一样出售。随着《汤姆叔叔的小屋》的出版，这种奴隶制机构中家庭破裂的现象真正引起了北方人的注意。

到内战前夕（正如我所说），大多数奴隶都在深南部地区——例如密西西比州、阿拉巴马州、路易斯安那州、佐治亚州等等。奴隶——无论你在哪里，无论你的主人多么好或多么残酷——他们都没有任何社会、政治或公民权利。在整个南方，奴隶学习读写都是非法的。

但尽管如此，非裔美国文化还是作为非洲和美国文化影响的融合而出现。奴隶发展了自己的文化和自己的体系。其中一个关键组成部分是非裔美国人的宗教，尤其是在第二次大觉醒之后——许多奴隶皈依了基督教，但这里发生的事情非常独特——黑人基督教，尤其是在卫理公会和浸礼会中，将采纳非洲的习俗，比如应答式的布道方式（借鉴西非的传统），教会领袖和教会成员之间存在这种来回的互动。另一个重要的组成部分是黑人奴隶歌曲（灵歌）的重要性，以及在这种文化中借鉴西非的传统。因此，这是这种经历的关键部分。

对奴隶制的抵抗将是巨大的，抵抗的形式多种多样：——例如，缓慢地工作（怠工）、疏忽、破坏设备是一种隐蔽的反抗方式——还有更公开的抵抗方式，比如逃跑（你知道哈丽特·塔布曼和她在地下铁路中的作用）——但由于距离遥远，逃跑非常困难——还有奴隶起义（真正地反抗）。奴隶起义并不少见，但由于种种原因（白人拥有武器，非裔美国人在南方缺乏盟友），它们很少成功。

但也有一些：——在殖民时期，最大的叛乱发生在1739年的南卡罗来纳州，当时奴隶试图逃往佛罗里达（在斯托诺叛乱期间，许多白人和奴隶被杀）——最终被镇压，南卡罗来纳州和其他殖民地对奴隶的限制进一步加强——丹麦·维西是另一次奴隶起义——他策划了这次起义（还是南卡罗来纳州的丹麦·维西先生）——一场大规模的叛乱被策划出来。维西是一位非裔美国自由人，但不幸的是，维西被告密者出卖，他和一些追随者被杀——美国革命后唯一导致美国人死亡的叛乱发生在1831年，那当然是纳特·特纳的叛乱（务必了解这一点）。这是唯一一次南方白人被杀的叛乱——60名弗吉尼亚人（其中许多是妇女和儿童）被杀。最终，纳特·特纳本人和他的追随者也被杀。

由于这些叛乱，南方人将做出反应——他们将制定更严厉的法律。已经有很多严厉的法律了，但黑人法典（限制南方非裔美国自由人的行动）和奴隶巡逻队将加强对那些逃跑者的搜捕。

随着时间的推移，你还将看到废奴运动的兴起：——最早反对奴隶制的人之一是贵格会教徒——在殖民时期，他们不仅反对战争，而且反对奴隶制机构——你还有其他运动，比如美国殖民协会——他们的全部目标是解放奴隶，然后将他们送回非洲。1822年，利比里亚成立——他们以总统（詹姆斯·门罗）的名字将首都命名为蒙罗维亚。但这从来都不是一个很大的运动，因为它不是很实际，只有大约12000名奴隶被送往非洲。它不是很实际的原因是，许多这些人不再与非洲大陆有任何联系——他们出生在美国，他们是美国人，美国殖民协会最终是一个失败的计划——你还有许多非裔美国人在废奴运动中发挥主导作用。其中最著名的是大卫·沃克——一位非裔美国自由人，他在1829年写了一篇非常有力的抗议文学作品，名为《致世界有色公民的呼吁》，他在其中呼吁非裔美国人进行暴力起义。他的小册子在整个南方都被禁止——威廉·劳埃德·加里森是另一位废奴主义者——1833年，他创建了美国反奴隶制协会，呼吁立即无偿解放奴隶。他出版了反奴隶制报纸《解放者》，他和他的追随者在北方和南方都非常不受欢迎——当然，一些更著名的获得自由后倡导废奴主义的前奴隶是弗雷德里克·道格拉斯和索杰纳·特鲁斯这样的人——你还看到奴隶制某种程度上影响了政治——1840年，自由党成立，他们开始认为解决奴隶制问题的最佳方式是通过政治进程。因此，你看到了许多具有不同策略和哲学的不同废奴运动。

最后，随着你看到北方对奴隶制的这种反应和批评，你看到南方人以对奴隶制的全面辩护做出反应：——事实上，在国会中，你看到了著名的“禁言决议”的实施，从1836年到1844年——在国会内部谈论奴隶制是非法的（实际上是被禁止的）。禁止在国会讨论或辩论任何反奴隶制请愿书。这在1844年被约翰·昆西·亚当斯推翻，因此奴隶制问题再次在国会大厅被讨论——将禁止教奴隶读写——这被视为抵抗的途径，因此在整个南方都非常严格地执行——当然，南方各州将制定严格的奴隶法典，尤其是在像纳特·特纳叛乱这样的事件之后，因为这种恐惧，并且希望确保未来的叛乱不会发生——反奴隶制信息和反奴隶制文学（比如大卫·沃克的《呼吁》或《解放者》报纸）在南方被禁止——他们不会派送——最后，你实际上看到了南方人中亲奴隶制论点的发展，比如乔治·菲茨休、约翰·C·卡尔霍恩等人。他们的论点归结为：

* 奴隶制是好事
* 对奴隶制的批评是不合理的
* 存在这种奴隶被当作家人对待的观点（这种非常家长式的奴隶制观点——我们正在照顾这些人）
* 这比北方工厂里的工资奴隶制要好——南方人照顾他们的财产（他们的奴隶）
* 最后，还有这种文明论——这些人是劣等人，通过将他们带到美国（强迫他们来到美国），我们正在提升和文明化一个劣等群体。显然，你可以看出其中的荒谬之处。

what's going down APUSH people? today
we're going to take a look at the South
and the institution of slavery. if you're
reading any of those APUSH books -
American Pageant chapter 16 or the other
two - this lecture is going to
help you out.

so couple key things:
slavery in America's been going on
unfortunately - the first slave ships come
in 1619 to Jamestown, and of course with
Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, the colony of
Virginia shifts from primarily
indentured servants to Black chattel
slavery. slavery was a major issue at the
Constitutional Convention, but what
happens is the framers of the
Constitution postpone a solution to this
problem (slavery) until later on. but we
do have:

- the three-fifths compromise
- the slave trade is agreed that it will
end in 1808 (but there will be a very
important internal slave trade within
the United States)
- and of course in the Constitution there is a fugitive slave
law that said Southerners can go get
their runaway slaves.

we also saw that after
and following the American Revolution, many
states in both the North and the middle
areas (for example Pennsylvania and
New York) are going to slowly abolish
slavery. there is economic reasons for
this (slavery wasn't very important or
profitable to those regions) but also
ideological - right, you know these
inequalities in society are becoming
more and more apparent when you're
talking about natural rights and other things. so
slavery is going to fade away from
certain states.

and of course under the
Articles of Confederation, we see slavery
was banned by the Northwest Ordinance of
1787 - so there was a banning of slavery
north of the Ohio River in that
territory (the old Northwest).

we also saw that during the
Missouri Compromise, the issue of slavery
caused a huge conflict. but ultimately
both sides backed down - a truce was
reached which will postpone the issue of
slavery to later decades. but of course
this compromise will gradually break
down as confrontations over slavery
became increasingly bitter. but the
Missouri Compromise is important.

so let's take a look at this kind of
Southern society. and when you think
about Southern society, you have to think
about King Cotton. cotton was key - the
Southern economy was always reliant on
cash crops, whether that be tobacco in
Virginia during the colonial times or
rice in South Carolina, but also cotton.
and what really kind of sets this thing
off like never before is Eli Whitney in
the 1790s invents the cotton gin, which
allows for this cash crop (cotton) to
become very very profitable because one
individual can separate the seeds from
the cotton with this machine.

and as a result of this huge increase in cotton
production:

- there's a demand for land for
cotton production
- which leads to an increase (a huge increase) in the demand and
the profitability of slave labor
- and what you see is this is all being fueled
by the Market Revolution - Northern
industries are demanding this
Southern cotton (these raw materials), as
well as England
- and this is going to bring enormous prosperity in the textile
mills (making really awesome shirts like
the one you see right there), but
prosperity not just for the South but
also the North and England - and it's
being built on the backs of slave labor.

and what you see is if you take
a look at maps of this time period - in
the 1820s, cotton production is largely
along the coast in South Carolina and
Georgia, but as you see as time goes on
by 1860, cotton production is moving West.
and along with this increase in cotton
production comes this demand for land as well as this
demand for slave labor, and you have this
huge internal slave trade taking place
where people are moving slaves between
states, especially in the Deep South states.

so here you have the slave
concentration in 1820, and as you can see
by 1860, there's this very very huge
percent of the population being more
than 50% slave in states like South
Carolina and Mississippi.

keep in mind as the
movement West takes place, this brings up
issues (as we saw with the Missouri
Compromise) over whether or not this new
territory will be slave or free. the
Missouri Compromise is just one of these examples -
you also have the Compromise of 1850 and
the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. all of these will postpone and not
end the crisis that will occur between
the North and South.

so we're going to
take a look at the antebellum South (the
pre-war South) - what did it look like?
and a couple things:

1. obviously it was a primarily agrarian society - cotton
is king
2. there's a lack of industrialization - there's really no need
if you're a Southerner to industrialize
because your money (your capital) was
invested in slave labor, so you don't
have the funds to industrialize nor do
you have a real desire to do so
3. 25% of the population of the South owned slaves
(important point) - meaning the overwhelming
majority (3/4) of Southern whites owned no
slaves at all. the average number of
slaves that were owned was less than 10.
and yet the majority of Southerners are
not slave owners, yet they support and
defend the institution of slavery. and if
you're asking why - well, there's a hope
that they will one day own slaves, but
also there's this racism and there's
this whole social hierarchy, and at the
bottom of that social hierarchy in
Southern society was in fact
African-American slaves. and so if you
were at least above some group in
society, that created a sense of comfort.

in terms of Southern politics, it was in
many ways an oligarchy - meaning a
government by the wealthy few. and the
people who really controlled Southern
politics were the plantation owners -
those people who owned (typically) more
than 100 slaves. the South was very undemocratic - there was a
huge gap between the rich and the poor,
and it was large slaveholders
controlling Southern politics. they are
the ones dominating the legislators of
the different states.

in fact, if you look
at Southern society, it could be broken
down into these four groups among
Southern whites:

1. the plantation owners - they are the very wealthy, the elite (the 1%)
2. the small slaveholders - these are people that typically own around 10 or fewer slaves
3. the majority of the population - the yeoman farmers (they own no slaves at all)
4. at the bottom of Southern white society are the people of the pine barrens - they own no slaves and they also own no land

and then of course, this is very different
than the North - the North is
industrializing. there's a lack of
immigration to the South - if you're an
Irish or a German or any immigrant,
you're not going to go to the South
because land is very expensive and the
competition is free labor. there is no
real reason to immigrate to the South,
and as a result those public school
reforms like Horace Mann, you're not
going to see that take place in the
South either.

and if you take a look
at the Southern population between the
whites, the slaves, and you have a free
black population in some states
(especially the Upper South), you could see
in Delaware 17% free African-American,
Virginia 5%, but of course like we saw
over half the population of states like
South Carolina and Mississippi are in
fact slaves. the Deep South is going to
be very reliant on slave labor on these
plantations.

now what do the
African-American communities look like
at this time? and you see a variety of
experiences:

1. in the North, there was about 250,000 free African-Americans in
the North by the time of the Civil War
in 1860, and life was not good for them
either. even though there is no slavery
in the North by this point in time,
there was a lot of tension with Irish
immigrants with competition over low-
skill jobs (you know who's going to be
getting the low-skilled jobs - well
African-Americans and Irish immigrants
are going to compete for those). and as
a result you're going to see a lot of
racial tension in the North as well.
2. a lot of people are surprised that there is a free black population in the
South - by 1860 it's also around 250,000
people. many of these are African-
Americans who gained their freedom -
many are mulatto (they're of mixed race -
perhaps they had a white father who
freed them). many were freed after the
American Revolution in the South, and
some they paid for their freedom - they
were able to raise money by working
extra hours and they were paid a little
bit of money, and over time they were able to
buy their freedom. of course there were many restrictions on
daily life for these free
African-American communities, especially
after Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831.

slavery itself - important to keep in mind -
it varied from region to region,
from owner to owner. there was no one
experience, but in all circumstances
slavery was based upon chattel slavery -
slaves were treated as property. very
often you would see families being
separated - they were sold just as you
would sell any piece of equipment on the
farm. and this really was brought to
Northerners' attention with the
publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin - this
idea of families being broken up in
this institution of slavery.

by the eve of the Civil War (like I said) most
slaves were in the Deep South - so states
like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana,
Georgia and so on. and slaves - no
matter where you were, no matter how nice or
brutal your master was - they were
not afforded any social, political or
civil rights. it was illegal to learn to
read or write if you were a slave
throughout the South.

but in spite of all this,
African-American culture emerged as a
blending of African and American
cultural influences. slaves developed their
own culture and their own system. one of
the key components of this is the
African-American religion, especially
after this Second Great Awakening - many
slaves had been converted to
Christianity, but what happens here is
very unique - black Christianity,
especially amongst Methodists and
Baptists, is going to adopt African
practices like the responsorial style of
preaching (drawing on West African
traditions) where you have this kind of
back and forth between the church leaders and the members of the
church. and another important component
of this is the importance of the black
slave songs (the spirituals) and
drawing on West African traditions in
this culture. so this is key part of this
experience.

there is going to be enormous
resistance to slavery, and forms of
resistance take different types:
- for instance, slowly working (work
slowdowns), negligence, breaking equipment
was a way to rebel in a kind of covert way
- there were more overt ways of resistance such as running away (you know Harriet Tubman and her
role with the Underground Railroad) -
very difficult though to get away
because of the large distances
- and slave revolts (actually rebelling). slave revolts
were not uncommon, but for a number of
reasons (whites had the weapons,
African-Americans lacked allies in the
South) they rarely succeeded.

but there were some:

- during colonial times, the biggest rebellion took place in
1739 in South Carolina as slaves
tried to run away to Florida (and you
have a number of whites and slaves killed
during the Stono Rebellion) - eventually
put down and further restrictions put
upon slaves in South Carolina and other colonies
- Denmark Vesey is another slave revolt - he planned it (Mr.
Denmark Vesey in South Carolina again) - a
massive revolt was planned. Vesey was a free
African-American, but unfortunately
for Vesey he is betrayed by informers
and he and some of his followers are
killed
- the one rebellion that actually led to the death of Americans during the
post-American Revolution period
happens in 1831, and that of course is
Nat Turner's Rebellion (make sure you
know about that). it is the only revolt in
which Southern whites are killed - 60
Virginians (many of them women and
children) are killed. eventually Nat Turner himself
and his followers are killed.

as a result
of these revolts, Southerners are going
to react - they're going to create harsher
laws. there were already many harsh laws,
but the Black Codes (which restricted the
movement of free African-Americans in
the South) and also slave patrols are
going to increase hunting those
individuals who have run away.

you're also going to see the growth of an
abolitionist movement as time goes on:

- one of the earliest opponents of slavery
were Quakers - they were opposed to
not only war but also the institution of
slavery during the colonial period
- you also get other movements like the
American Colonization Society - their
whole thing was to free slaves and then
send them back to Africa. and in
1822, Liberia was formed - they name
its capital Monrovia after the president
(James Monroe). but that was never a very big movement
because it wasn't very practical, and
only about 12,000 slaves are sent to
Africa. and the reason it wasn't very
practical is many of these individuals
had no connection to the continent any
longer - they were born in America, they
were American, and the American
Colonization Society ultimately was a
failed plan
- you also have many African-Americans taking the lead role
in the abolition movement. one of the
most famous ones is David Walker - a free
African-American who writes a very
powerful piece of protest literature
in 1829 called "Appeal to the Colored
Citizens of the World" in which he called
on African-American people to rebel in a violent uprising. and his pamphlet is banned throughout
the South
- William Lloyd Garrison is
another abolitionist - in 1833 he creates
the American Anti-Slavery Society which
calls for the immediate uncompensated
emancipation of slaves. he publishes "The
Liberator" which is the anti-slavery
newspaper, and him and his followers were
very unpopular in the North and the
South
- and of course some of the more
famous former slaves who advocate for
abolitionism after they get their
freedom are people like Frederick
Douglass and Sojourner Truth
- and you also see slavery kind of infecting politics -
in 1840 you have the Liberty Party
forming which starts to say the best way
to deal with the issue of slavery is
through the political process. so you get
a lot of different abolitionist movements
with different strategies and
philosophies.

and then finally, as you
have this reaction and this kind of
criticism of slavery from the North, you
see Southerners react with this whole
defense of slavery:

- in fact in Congress you have the famous gag
resolution being imposed which from 1836
to 1844 - it was illegal (it was actually
banned) to talk about slavery within
Congress. there was a ban on any
anti-slavery petitions being discussed
or debated within Congress. this famously
was overturned by John Quincy Adams in
1844, and so the issue of slavery is once
again discussed in the halls of Congress
- there are going to be bans on teaching
slaves to read or write - this was seen as
a path to resistance, so this was
something that was very much enforced
throughout the South
- and of course Southern states are going to have strict
slave codes, especially after events like
Nat Turner's revolt, because of this fear
and wanting to ensure that future
revolts do not materialize
- anti-slavery messages and anti-slavery literature (such as David
Walker's "Appeal" or "The Liberator"
newspaper) were banned from the South -
they would not deliver it
- and finally you actually get the development of a
pro-slavery argument amongst Southerners
such as George Fitzhugh, John C. Calhoun
and others. and the argument comes down to
this:

  * slavery is a good thing
  * this criticism of slavery is unjustified
  * there's this idea that slaves
are being treated as family (this very paternalistic view of slavery -
that we're taking care of these
individuals)
  * and this is better than what
is happening in the North in factories
with the wage slavery that takes place
up there - the Southerners take care of
their property (their slaves)
  * and then finally there's also this kind of
civilization argument - that these are
inferior people and that by bringing
them to America (forcibly bringing them
to America) that we are uplifting and
civilizing an inferior group. and
obviously you can see the BS in this.

that's going to do it for today.
