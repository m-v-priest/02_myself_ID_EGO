Welcome back to Joe's Productions. Today we're taking a look at the 1980s 二十世纪八十年代 -- the rise of Ronald Reagan and a whole bunch of other stuff. We're almost done. We're almost ready to for the AP exam in May. So hopefully you're feeling confident.

So you can't understand the rise of Reagan without understanding the rise of the conservative movement 保守主义运动. And you could trace this all the way back to the election of 1964. Remember Barry Goldwater is running as the Republican candidate against Lyndon Johnson. Although he loses, the conservative movement is really starting to become a national movement with some influence.

Nixon gets elected in 1968 as the Republican Party candidate and starts adopting more Republican policies at the federal level. And the conservative movement is really a reaction to a whole bunch of things that had been happening especially in the 60s. You see this reaction to New Deal liberalism 新政自由主义. You know remember Franklin Roosevelt establishing the welfare state 福利国家 in America. You have other presidents like Harry Truman with his Fair Deal. And then the big one is Lyndon Johnson and The Great Society.

Many Republicans and conservatives don't like a large federal government. They don't like this welfare state. There's a reaction to feminism 女权主义 -- all the changing roles for women in society. The legalization of abortion with Roe versus Wade. The sexual revolution 性解放 of the 1960s. The expansion of gay rights 同性恋权利. And affirmative action 平权法案 policies where race and gender are playing a role in job selection or college admission. Drug use especially of the counterculture 反主流文化. And there's a belief that these issues undermined family and religious values -- traditional values as they're often times referred to. A work ethic 职业道德 -- right if we give too many government programs, people are going to become lazy or dependent. And because of the Cold War going on, this idea it's undermining national security 国家安全.

And what you see even before Reagan gets elected in 1980 is the rise of various movements. You have the Moral Majority movement 道德多数派运动 founded by Reverend Jerry Falwell. These are religious fundamentalists 宗教原教旨主义者 and they become very involved in electoral politics 选举政治 mobilizing and supporting traditional conservative candidates. These individuals want creationism 神创论 taught in schools. They want a reversal of Roe versus Wade -- the so-called right to life movement 生命权运动. And a host of other conservative issues.

You also can see these individuals are called the rise of the religious right 宗教右翼. And there's all sorts of different groups -- not just the Moral Majority but others like Focus on the Family who advocate for abstinence education 禁欲教育, pro-life policies 反堕胎政策. So the conservative movement is mobilizing throughout the late 60s, 70s. And in 1980 they get their guy. Ronald Reagan gets elected.

You know the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was an important milestone 重要里程碑 for the conservative movement. He beats Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter is running for reelection. He gets slaughtered. And Reagan had been around for a while. He was involved in 1964 politics with Barry Goldwater kind of trying to get him elected. He becomes governor of California. Former actor. He's the man in 1980. And he takes office in 1981.

This is the New Right 新右派. They're opposed to government -- large federal governments, deficits. The famous quote: "Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem." So this is a very different view of the role of government from Republicans. With the election of Reagan, they're against liberal programs very often. They opposed government entitlement spending 福利支出 -- so spending on programs like food stamps 食品券, welfare which had exploded between 1960 and 1980 especially with The Great Society. They want cuts in those programs. They felt they were counterproductive 适得其反 in fighting poverty. They created dependency. And they didn't actually stimulate economic growth. This was the argument from conservative Republicans -- the New Right.

Important to keep in mind even though there are cuts to programs like food stamps and welfare under Reagan, there are many programs remain popular with voters. So especially Social Security 社会保障 from the New Deal days and Medicare 医疗保险 under The Great Society. Those programs which at one time were controversial for some Republicans or some small government advocates -- they remain popular and are going to sustain during Reagan's presidency as well.

Now important you know about Reagan and the economy. There's going to be some things he going to do. He favored what was known as supply-side economics 供给经济学 or Reaganomics 里根经济学 as it was called. And the basic idea is there was enacted significant tax cuts 减税 for the rich. And the idea would be is that the private sector 私营部门 -- rich, wealthy individuals -- would invest money and spend money to improve the economy. And this idea of trickle-down economics 涓滴经济学 -- if I'm a business or if I'm a wealthy individual and if the government taxes me less, I'm going to then hire more workers and grow my business. And this is very similar to the policies of the Republican administrations of the 1920s especially under Calvin Coolidge, Warren G. Harding and Herbert Hoover. This idea of trickle-down economics.

Other under Reagan you also see support for deregulation 放松管制 of many industries. Remember they argue for smaller government. And this really deregulation started in the 1970s. There was a growing group especially Republicans who supported free market approach 自由市场方法 -- let the market determine what's going to happen. And restrictions on banks were lessened. Auto emissions regulations 汽车排放法规 were reduced. Environmental protections 环境保护 were eased and so on during the 1980s under Reagan.

Union membership 工会成员 continued to decline especially in the 1980s. Remember there's a lot of different reasons for this. Many of the manufacturing jobs were going overseas. So therefore they're very difficult to unionize those workers. And there were anti-union policies 反工会政策 -- or at least no pro-union policies under the Reagan administration. In fact, federal air traffic controllers 联邦航空管制员 were fired for going on strike. And labor unions continued to become weaker and weaker throughout the 1980s.

You are not going to see the federal budget balanced under Reagan. The federal budget was not balanced. And there's a variety of reasons for this. Two of them are increased defense spending 国防开支 -- he's spending lots of money on the defense industry. And the fact that there are tax cuts especially for the wealthy. This is going to mean the budget is going to continue to go up. So in spite of his wanting less federal government, the federal budget deficit 联邦预算赤字 will increase under Reagan. So you're spending more money on defense while at the same time taking in less tax revenues 税收收入. The budget is going to increase.

Now Reagan's foreign policy is key as well. He is going to advocate and pursue an interventionist foreign policy 干预主义外交政策. He's going to be very heavily involved in the world. And of course Reagan asserted US opposition to communism through a variety of different methods. The Cold War had kind of cooled a bit under Carter and Ford. There were issues. And under Nixon with détente. Reagan's going to pursue speeches -- his so-called his famous "evil empire 邪恶帝国" speech where he calls the Soviet Union an "evil empire." He is going to have limited military interventions 军事干预 in places like Grenada. We'll talk about that in a moment. And he's going to have diplomatic efforts. And his relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev is hugely important. And it is going to lead to a relaxation of tension. There you can see Reagan and Gorbachev right there.

Military spending is going to increase as we've mentioned. And all of these things are going to be used by the Reagan administration to limit communist expansion. He's also going to propose a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) 战略防御计划. The nickname was "Star Wars" where basically the idea would be lasers from space stations would be used to defend against potential attacks especially nukes. The lasers would shoot out the nukes from the sky. It is very costly. A lot of people criticized it. And it actually never happened as a result. But these are all different strategies that Reagan utilized in his opposition to communism.

Now important to keep in mind is this idea of the Reagan Doctrine 里根主义. And basically Reagan says in his Doctrine he and the US are going to support opponents of communism anywhere and everywhere. And he didn't necessarily make a connection to Soviet-supported communism. We are just going to be opposed to communism wherever it happens to be. And an example of this commitment to an anti-communist cause can be seen in 1979 in Nicaragua. A Marxist group known as the Sandinistas 桑地诺民族解放阵线 led a revolt against the pro-American right-wing dictatorship 右翼独裁政权. So there was a government -- they were very right-wing. They were not democratic. And a Marxist group -- the Sandinistas -- revolt against them and overthrow them.

This is going to lead Reagan and his administration to increase US involvement in the so-called "third world" and pursue a very interventionist foreign policy. We are going to support the right-wing dictator since they are in fact anti-communist. What you're going to see is the Reagan administration provided military aid to the Contras 反政府武装. The Contras were an anti-government guerrilla group 游击队. They are opposed to this Marxist group. And the US is going to give them funding in their fight against the Sandinistas -- the Sandinistas being the Marxist group. And this becomes very controversial because Congress -- controlled by Democrats -- in 1985 passed something called the Boland Amendment 博兰修正案 which prevented further aid to the Contras. We were worried that we were very much getting involved in the internal affairs 内政 of this country in Central America. And Congress says no more to this.

Another example of Reagan's foreign policy can be seen in Grenada. There's a pro-Cuban regime 亲古巴政权 which comes to power after a coup. You can see Grenada on the map. And Reagan sends in in 1983 a small force of Marines to return the pro-US government to power. So once again very active around the world trying to pursue US interests even if those conflicted with the local population.

A very famous event you should know about is the Iran-Contra affair 伊朗门事件 where weapon sales to Iran were used to fund Contras in Nicaragua. Remember the Contras were those fighting the Sandinistas. This becomes hugely controversial for a couple of reasons. One -- it was illegal since it violated the Boland Amendment. We were not supposed to give funds to the Contras. And it very much embarrassed the Reagan administration because he said publicly he was not going to negotiate with terrorists. And one of the reasons we were selling these weapons to Iran was because they were going to help us get some American hostages free. Reagan claimed he didn't have anything to do with it. So the administration suffers a blow in its popularity.

The US and the Soviet Union are going to be a key part of this story as well. Cold War tensions increased under Reagan with all these different US interventions. But it's important to note also that his relationship with Gorbachev who comes to power in 1985 is going to be hugely important. Gorbachev comes to power in 1985 and begins a series of reforms. The economy of the Soviet Union was in awful shape. The arms race 军备竞赛 was costing them so much money. And their economy had just kind of declined. And he starts a series of reforms. One is known as glasnost 公开性 -- or openness -- greater political freedom. And the other one is perestroika 改革 -- this is slowly implemented capitalist reforms letting free market ideas and practices into Soviet society.

These reforms dramatically transformed the Soviet Union. And then partly as a result you're going to see huge changes in the Cold War. Gorbachev is going to pull back in places such as Eastern Europe. He basically says we're no longer going to support these countries. And in places like Poland you're going to see independence movements and eventually the formation of non-communist countries in that once place in that place once called the Iron Curtain 铁幕.

You're also going to see famous kind of moments during the Cold War. Reagan in 1987 speaking in Germany saying "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall" at Brandenburg Gate right there in front of the Berlin Wall. And so all of these things are changing very rapidly. You're going to have arms control agreements 军备控制协议 as well. And the most famous one is in 1987 -- Gorbachev and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (the INF Treaty) 中程核力量条约 which eliminates those weapons from both the US and the Soviet arsenals.

And not too long after Reagan leaves office, the Cold War will finally come to an end. It had been going through periods of intense conflict to periods of relaxation of tensions. And you're going to see the Cold War end due to a variety of factors. There are political and economic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Here you see people kind of climbing at top the Berlin Wall. The reforms in the Soviet Union coupled with the huge problems the Soviet economy was having. All of this kind of begins to finalize this process that had been going on for a while. Increased US military spending kind of made the Soviets unable to compete which contributes to the downfall of the Soviet Union.

You have Reagan's diplomatic initiatives where the US and the Soviets are negotiating especially that relationship between Gorbachev and Reagan. And by 1991 you are going to have the dissolution of the Soviet Union 苏联解体. The Soviet Union will cease to exist. You're going to have coup and various former Soviet republics declaring independence. And the Soviet Union will come to an end. And this will be under George Bush at the end of the Cold War.

This required the US to redefine its role in the world. This is really important but later on. And the big thing is going to be following attacks on 9/11 -- the focus became fighting terrorism. So no longer was the enemy a very clear target -- the Soviet Union. It's going to be much more difficult in this post-Cold War world because the enemy is not one nation. It is this terrorist threat.

Couple things about George Bush you should know just really quickly. He is elected in 1988. And kind of one of the big events you should know is the Persian Gulf War 海湾战争 or what was known as Operation Desert Storm 沙漠风暴行动. In 1990, Iraq under the leadership of Saddam Hussein they invaded neighboring Kuwait. Kuwait was a very oil-rich country. Saddam Hussein invades it. And the United States enters on behalf of Kuwait into a fight. A US-led coalition 美国领导的联盟. And they ultimately removed Iraqi troops and liberated Kuwait. This was a joint effort with other countries with the US playing a huge role in the war.

One last thing about Reagan and Bush presidencies. You're going to get the rise of a conservative Supreme Court 保守派最高法院. Remember this is in sharp contrast with the decisions of the Warren Court which was around from 1953 to 1969 led by Earl Warren. You're going to get more conservative justices. Famously Sandra Day O'Connor is nominated to the Supreme Court in 1981. She is the first woman. And she is nominated by Ronald Reagan. You're going to get other conservative justices like Antonin Scalia who just passed away in 2016. Clarence Thomas is nominated by George Bush. There's a huge battle over his confirmation because of sexual harassment charges 性骚扰指控. And the court under these more conservative judges are going to do things like allow states to place restrictions on abortion. So parents had to be notified in one of the cases the court rules. And affirmative action policies were rolled back. So they rule in a much more conservative way than previous courts had.

That's going to do it for today. You are almost to the finish line. Make sure before you take the AP exam you eat a good meal. I love street tacos but it's probably not the best bet just before you're going to sit for an over three-hour test. Good luck in May. Have a beautiful day. Make sure you subscribe. And peace.

欢迎回到乔的制作。今天我们来看看20世纪80年代——罗纳德·里根的崛起, 以及一大堆其他事情。我们快完成了。我们几乎准备好迎接五月份的AP考试了。所以希望你们感觉自信。

不理解保守主义运动的兴起，就无法理解里根的崛起。你们可以追溯到1964年的总统选举。记住，巴里·戈德华特作为共和党候选人, 与林登·约翰逊竞争。尽管他输了，但保守主义运动实际上开始成为一个具有一定影响力的全国性运动。

尼克松在1968年, 作为共和党候选人当选总统，并开始在联邦层面, 采取更多共和党政策。保守主义运动, 实际上是对尤其是在60年代发生的一系列事情的反应。你们看到了对新政自由主义的反弹。你们知道，记住, 富兰克林·罗斯福在美国建立了福利国家。还有像哈里·杜鲁门这样的其他总统, 推行了他的“公平施政”。然后最重要的是林登·约翰逊和他的“伟大社会”。

**许多共和党人和保守派, 不喜欢庞大的联邦政府。他们不喜欢这个福利国家。**社会上女性角色的变化，是对女权主义的反弹。《罗伊诉韦德案》使堕胎合法化。20世纪60年代的性革命。同性恋权利的扩大。以及在就业选择, 或大学录取中，种族和性别发挥作用的平权行动政策。尤其是反主流文化的吸毒问题。人们认为, 这些问题破坏了家庭和宗教价值观——通常被称为"传统价值观"。职业道德——如果我们提供太多的政府项目，人们会变得懒惰或依赖。由于冷战正在进行，这种观点认为它正在破坏国家安全。

甚至在里根1980年当选总统之前，你们就看到了各种运动的兴起。你们看到了杰里·福尔韦尔牧师创立的道德多数派运动。这些人是宗教原教旨主义者，他们积极参与选举政治，动员和支持传统的保守派候选人。这些人希望在学校教授神创论。他们希望推翻《罗伊诉韦德案》——所谓的生命权运动。以及一系列其他保守派议题。

你们还可以看到这些人被称为宗教右翼的崛起。存在各种不同的团体——不仅仅是道德多数派，还有像“关注家庭”这样的其他团体，他们倡导禁欲教育和反堕胎政策。因此，保守主义运动在60年代末和70年代整个时期都在动员。1980年，他们如愿以偿。罗纳德·里根当选总统。

你们知道，罗纳德·里根在1980年当选总统是保守主义运动的一个重要里程碑。他击败了吉米·卡特。吉米·卡特竞选连任，但他惨败。里根已经活跃政坛一段时间了。1964年，他参与了巴里·戈德华特的竞选活动，试图帮助他当选。他成为加利福尼亚州州长。前演员。他是1980年的风云人物。他于1981年就职。

这是新右派。他们反对政府——庞大的联邦政府，赤字。一句名言是：“政府不是我们问题的答案。政府才是问题。”因此，这与共和党人对政府角色的看法截然不同。随着里根的当选，他们通常反对自由主义政策。他们反对政府的福利支出——因此，在1960年至1980年期间，尤其是在“伟大社会”时期，食品券和福利等项目的支出急剧增加。他们希望削减这些项目。他们认为这些项目在对抗贫困方面适得其反，造成了依赖性，并且实际上并没有刺激经济增长。这是保守派共和党人——新右派——的论点。

重要的是要记住，尽管在里根执政期间，食品券和福利等项目有所削减，但许多项目仍然受到选民的欢迎。特别是新政时期的社会保障和“伟大社会”时期的医疗保险。这些项目一度对一些共和党人或一些小政府倡导者来说存在争议——但它们仍然受欢迎，并且在里根总统执政期间也将得以维持。

现在重要的是你们要了解里根和经济。他将采取一些措施。他赞成所谓的供给侧经济学或里根经济学。其基本思想是对富人实行大幅减税。其理念是，私营部门——富裕的个人——将投资和消费以改善经济。这种涓滴经济学的想法——如果我是一个企业或一个富裕的个人，如果政府减少我的税收，我就会雇用更多的工人并发展我的企业。这与20世纪20年代共和党政府的政策非常相似，尤其是在卡尔文·柯立芝、沃伦·G·哈定和赫伯特·胡佛时期。这种涓滴经济学的思想。

在里根执政期间，你们还看到了对许多行业放松管制的呼声。记住，他们主张小政府。这种放松管制实际上始于20世纪70年代。一个日益壮大的群体，尤其是共和党人，支持自由市场的方法——让市场决定将要发生的事情。对银行的限制减少了。汽车排放法规减少了。在里根执政的1980年代，环境保护有所放松等等。

工会会员人数继续下降，尤其是在1980年代。记住，这有很多不同的原因。许多制造业工作流向海外。因此，这些工人很难组织起来。里根政府也没有采取支持工会的政策，或者至少没有亲工会的政策。事实上，联邦航空交通管制员因罢工而被解雇。在整个1980年代，工会持续变得越来越弱。

你们不会看到里根执政期间联邦预算实现平衡。联邦预算没有平衡。这有很多原因。其中两个原因是国防开支增加——他在国防工业上花费了大量资金。以及事实上，尤其是对富人减税。这意味着预算将继续增加。因此，尽管他希望减少联邦政府的规模，但在里根执政期间，联邦预算赤字将增加。因此，你们在增加国防开支的同时，税收收入也在减少。预算将会增加。

现在里根的外交政策也很关键。他将倡导并奉行干涉主义外交政策。他将非常积极地参与世界事务。当然，里根通过各种不同的方法强调美国反对共产主义。在卡特和福特执政期间，冷战有所缓和。但仍然存在问题。而在尼克松执政期间则推行缓和政策。里根将发表讲话——他著名的“邪恶帝国”演讲，他在演讲中称苏联为“邪恶帝国”。他将在格林纳达等地进行有限的军事干预。我们稍后会谈到这一点。他还将进行外交努力。他与米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫的关系至关重要。这将导致紧张局势的缓和。你们可以在那里看到里根和戈尔巴乔夫。

正如我们提到的，军事开支将会增加。里根政府将利用所有这些手段来限制共产主义的扩张。他还将提出战略防御倡议（SDI）。其绰号是“星球大战”，其基本思想是利用来自空间站的激光来防御潜在的袭击，尤其是核武器袭击。激光将从空中击落核武器。这非常昂贵。许多人批评它。它实际上从未实现。但这些都是里根在反对共产主义时使用的不同策略。

现在重要的是要记住里根主义的思想。基本上，里根在他的主义中表示，他和美国将支持任何地方、任何反对共产主义的人。他并不一定将此与苏联支持的共产主义联系起来。无论共产主义出现在哪里，我们都将反对它。这种对反共事业的承诺的一个例子可以在1979年的尼加拉瓜看到。一个名为桑地诺民族解放阵线的马克思主义团体领导了一场反对亲美的右翼独裁统治的起义。当时存在一个政府——他们非常右翼，他们不是民主的。一个马克思主义团体——桑地诺民族解放阵线——反抗他们并推翻了他们。

这将导致里根及其政府增加美国在所谓的“第三世界”的介入，并奉行非常干涉主义的外交政策。我们将支持右翼独裁者，因为他们实际上是反共的。你们将看到里根政府向反政府游击队——反政府武装——提供了军事援助。他们反对这个马克思主义团体。美国将资助他们对抗桑地诺民族解放阵线——桑地诺民族解放阵线是马克思主义团体。这变得极具争议，因为由民主党控制的国会在1985年通过了一项名为博兰修正案的法案，该法案阻止了进一步向反政府武装提供援助。我们担心我们过多地介入了这个中美洲国家的内政。国会表示不再支持。

里根外交政策的另一个例子可以在格林纳达看到。在一次政变后，一个亲古巴的政权上台。你们可以在地图上看到格林纳达。里根在1983年派遣了一小股海军陆战队，以恢复亲美政府的统治。因此，美国再次在世界各地非常活跃，试图追求美国的利益，即使这些利益与当地人民的利益相冲突。

你们应该了解的一个非常著名的事件是伊朗门事件，其中向伊朗出售武器的收入被用来资助尼加拉瓜的反政府武装。记住，反政府武装是那些与桑地诺民族解放阵线作战的人。这引发了巨大的争议，原因有二。第一，这是非法的，因为它违反了博兰修正案。我们不应该向反政府武装提供资金。这极大地使里根政府难堪，因为他公开表示他不会与恐怖分子谈判。我们向伊朗出售这些武器的原因之一是他们将帮助我们释放一些美国人质。里根声称他与此事无关。因此，政府的受欢迎程度遭受了打击。

美国和苏联也将是这个故事的关键部分。在里根执政期间，由于美国的所有这些干预行动，冷战的紧张局势加剧了。但同样重要的是要注意，他与1985年上台的戈尔巴乔夫的关系至关重要。戈尔巴乔夫于1985年上台并开始了一系列改革。苏联的经济状况非常糟糕。军备竞赛花费了他们大量的资金。他们的经济已经衰退。他开始了一系列改革。一项被称为“开放政策”——或开放性——更大的政治自由。另一项是“经济改革”——这是缓慢实施的资本主义改革，允许自由市场的思想和实践进入苏联社会。

这些改革极大地改变了苏联。部分由于这些改革，你们将看到冷战发生巨大的变化。戈尔巴乔夫将在东欧等地撤退。他基本上说我们不再支持这些国家。在波兰等地，你们将看到独立运动，并最终在曾经被称为铁幕的地方形成非共产主义国家。

你们还将看到冷战期间一些著名的时刻。1987年，里根在德国发表讲话，在勃兰登堡门前的柏林墙边说：“戈尔巴乔夫先生，推倒这堵墙。”因此，所有这些事情都在迅速变化。你们还将看到军备控制协议。最著名的是1987年——戈尔巴乔夫和里根签署了《中程核力量条约》（INF条约），该条约消除了美国和苏联武库中的这些武器。

里根卸任后不久，冷战将最终结束。它经历了从激烈的冲突时期到紧张局势缓和时期的转变。你们将看到由于多种因素导致冷战结束。苏联和东欧发生了政治和经济变化。你们在这里看到人们爬上柏林墙。苏联的改革加上苏联经济面临的巨大问题。所有这些都开始最终确定这个已经持续了一段时间的过程。美国军事开支的增加使得苏联无法与之竞争，这导致了苏联的解体。

你们有里根的外交倡议，美国和苏联正在谈判，特别是戈尔巴乔夫和里根之间的关系。到1991年，你们将看到苏联解体。苏联将不复存在。你们将看到政变和各种前苏联共和国宣布独立。苏联将走向终结。这将在冷战结束时期的乔治·布什总统任内发生。

这要求美国重新定义其在世界上的角色。这非常重要，但那是后来的事了。最重要的是在911袭击之后——焦点转向打击恐怖主义。因此，敌人不再是一个非常明确的目标——苏联。在这个后冷战世界中，情况将更加困难，因为敌人不是一个国家，而是这种恐怖主义威胁。

关于乔治·布什，你们只需要快速了解几件事。他于1988年当选总统。你们应该了解的重大事件之一是海湾战争或所谓的沙漠风暴行动。1990年，在萨达姆·侯赛因领导下的伊拉克入侵了邻国科威特。科威特是一个石油资源非常丰富的国家。萨达姆·侯赛因入侵了它。美国代表科威特介入了一场战斗。一个由美国领导的联盟。他们最终驱逐了伊拉克军队并解放了科威特。这是与其他国家的共同努力，美国在战争中发挥了巨大的作用。

关于里根和布什总统任期的最后一件事。你们将看到保守派最高法院的崛起。记住，这与1953年至1969年由厄尔·沃伦领导的沃伦法院的裁决形成鲜明对比。你们将看到更多保守派大法官。著名的桑德拉·戴·奥康纳于1981年被提名为最高法院大法官。她是第一位女性。她由罗纳德·里根提名。你们还将看到其他保守派大法官，如2016年去世的安东宁·斯卡利亚。克拉伦斯·托马斯由乔治·布什提名。他的任命因性骚扰指控而引发了一场巨大的斗争。在这些更保守的法官领导下，法院将允许各州对堕胎施加限制。法院在一个案件中裁定，父母必须得到通知。平权行动政策被撤销。因此，他们的裁决方式比以前的法院保守得多。

今天就到这里。你们几乎到达终点线了。确保在参加AP考试前吃顿好的。我喜欢街头炸玉米饼，但这可能不是在参加三个多小时的考试前最好的选择。祝你们五月好运。祝你们度过美好的一天。确保你们订阅了。再见。

Welcome back to Joe's Productions. Today we're taking a look at the 1980s -- the rise of Ronald Reagan and a whole bunch of other stuff. We're almost done. We're almost ready to for the AP exam in May. So hopefully you're feeling confident.

So you can't understand the rise of Reagan without understanding the rise of the conservative movement. And you could trace this all the way back to the election of 1964. Remember Barry Goldwater is running as the Republican candidate against Lyndon Johnson. Although he loses, the conservative movement is really starting to become a national movement with some influence.

Nixon gets elected in 1968 as the Republican Party candidate and starts adopting more Republican policies at the federal level. And the conservative movement is really a reaction to a whole bunch of things that had been happening especially in the 60s. You see this reaction to New Deal liberalism. You know remember Franklin Roosevelt establishing the welfare state in America. You have other presidents like Harry Truman with his Fair Deal. And then the big one is Lyndon Johnson and The Great Society.

Many Republicans and conservatives don't like a large federal government. They don't like this welfare state. There's a reaction to feminism -- all the changing roles for women in society. The legalization of abortion with Roe versus Wade. The sexual revolution of the 1960s. The expansion of gay rights. And affirmative action policies where race and gender are playing a role in job selection or college admission. Drug use especially of the counterculture. And there's a belief that these issues undermined family and religious values -- traditional values as they're often times referred to. A work ethic -- right if we give too many government programs, people are going to become lazy or dependent. And because of the Cold War going on, this idea it's undermining national security.

And what you see even before Reagan gets elected in 1980 is the rise of various movements. You have the Moral Majority movement founded by Reverend Jerry Falwell. These are religious fundamentalists and they become very involved in electoral politics mobilizing and supporting traditional conservative candidates. These individuals want creationism taught in schools. They want a reversal of Roe versus Wade -- the so-called right to life movement. And a host of other conservative issues.

You also can see these individuals are called the rise of the religious right. And there's all sorts of different groups -- not just the Moral Majority but others like Focus on the Family who advocate for abstinence education, pro-life policies. So the conservative movement is mobilizing throughout the late 60s, 70s. And in 1980 they get their guy. Ronald Reagan gets elected.

You know the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was an important milestone for the conservative movement. He beats Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter is running for reelection. He gets slaughtered. And Reagan had been around for a while. He was involved in 1964 politics with Barry Goldwater kind of trying to get him elected. He becomes governor of California. Former actor. He's the man in 1980. And he takes office in 1981.

This is the New Right. They're opposed to government -- large federal governments, deficits. The famous quote: "Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem." So this is a very different view of the role of government from Republicans. With the election of Reagan, they're against liberal programs very often. They opposed government entitlement spending -- so spending on programs like food stamps, welfare which had exploded between 1960 and 1980 especially with The Great Society. They want cuts in those programs. They felt they were counterproductive in fighting poverty. They created dependency. And they didn't actually stimulate economic growth. This was the argument from conservative Republicans -- the New Right.

Important to keep in mind even though there are cuts to programs like food stamps and welfare under Reagan, there are many programs remain popular with voters. So especially Social Security from the New Deal days and Medicare under The Great Society. Those programs which at one time were controversial for some Republicans or some small government advocates -- they remain popular and are going to sustain during Reagan's presidency as well.

Now important you know about Reagan and the economy. There's going to be some things he going to do. He favored what was known as supply-side economics or Reaganomics as it was called. And the basic idea is there was enacted significant tax cuts for the rich. And the idea would be is that the private sector -- rich, wealthy individuals -- would invest money and spend money to improve the economy. And this idea of trickle-down economics -- if I'm a business or if I'm a wealthy individual and if the government taxes me less, I'm going to then hire more workers and grow my business. And this is very similar to the policies of the Republican administrations of the 1920s especially under Calvin Coolidge, Warren G. Harding and Herbert Hoover. This idea of trickle-down economics.

Other under Reagan you also see support for deregulation of many industries. Remember they argue for smaller government. And this really deregulation started in the 1970s. There was a growing group especially Republicans who supported free market approach -- let the market determine what's going to happen. And restrictions on banks were lessened. Auto emissions regulations were reduced. Environmental protections were eased and so on during the 1980s under Reagan.

Union membership continued to decline especially in the 1980s. Remember there's a lot of different reasons for this. Many of the manufacturing jobs were going overseas. So therefore they're very difficult to unionize those workers. And there were anti-union policies -- or at least no pro-union policies under the Reagan administration. In fact, federal air traffic controllers were fired for going on strike. And labor unions continued to become weaker and weaker throughout the 1980s.

You are not going to see the federal budget balanced under Reagan. The federal budget was not balanced. And there's a variety of reasons for this. Two of them are increased defense spending -- he's spending lots of money on the defense industry. And the fact that there are tax cuts especially for the wealthy. This is going to mean the budget is going to continue to go up. So in spite of his wanting less federal government, the federal budget deficit will increase under Reagan. So you're spending more money on defense while at the same time taking in less tax revenues. The budget is going to increase.

Now Reagan's foreign policy is key as well. He is going to advocate and pursue an interventionist foreign policy. He's going to be very heavily involved in the world. And of course Reagan asserted US opposition to communism through a variety of different methods. The Cold War had kind of cooled a bit under Carter and Ford. There were issues. And under Nixon with détente. Reagan's going to pursue speeches -- his so-called his famous "evil empire" speech where he calls the Soviet Union an "evil empire." He is going to have limited military interventions in places like Grenada. We'll talk about that in a moment. And he's going to have diplomatic efforts. And his relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev is hugely important. And it is going to lead to a relaxation of tension. There you can see Reagan and Gorbachev right there.

Military spending is going to increase as we've mentioned. And all of these things are going to be used by the Reagan administration to limit communist expansion. He's also going to propose a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The nickname was "Star Wars" where basically the idea would be lasers from space stations would be used to defend against potential attacks especially nukes. The lasers would shoot out the nukes from the sky. It is very costly. A lot of people criticized it. And it actually never happened as a result. But these are all different strategies that Reagan utilized in his opposition to communism.

Now important to keep in mind is this idea of the Reagan Doctrine. And basically Reagan says in his Doctrine he and the US are going to support opponents of communism anywhere and everywhere. And he didn't necessarily make a connection to Soviet-supported communism. We are just going to be opposed to communism wherever it happens to be. And an example of this commitment to an anti-communist cause can be seen in 1979 in Nicaragua. A Marxist group known as the Sandinistas led a revolt against the pro-American right-wing dictatorship. So there was a government -- they were very right-wing. They were not democratic. And a Marxist group -- the Sandinistas -- revolt against them and overthrow them.

This is going to lead Reagan and his administration to increase US involvement in the so-called "third world" and pursue a very interventionist foreign policy. We are going to support the right-wing dictator since they are in fact anti-communist. What you're going to see is the Reagan administration provided military aid to the Contras. The Contras were an anti-government guerrilla group. They are opposed to this Marxist group. And the US is going to give them funding in their fight against the Sandinistas -- the Sandinistas being the Marxist group. And this becomes very controversial because Congress -- controlled by Democrats -- in 1985 passed something called the Boland Amendment which prevented further aid to the Contras. We were worried that we were very much getting involved in the internal affairs of this country in Central America. And Congress says no more to this.

Another example of Reagan's foreign policy can be seen in Grenada. There's a pro-Cuban regime which comes to power after a coup. You can see Grenada on the map. And Reagan sends in in 1983 a small force of Marines to return the pro-US government to power. So once again very active around the world trying to pursue US interests even if those conflicted with the local population.

A very famous event you should know about is the Iran-Contra affair where weapon sales to Iran were used to fund Contras in Nicaragua. Remember the Contras were those fighting the Sandinistas. This becomes hugely controversial for a couple of reasons. One -- it was illegal since it violated the Boland Amendment. We were not supposed to give funds to the Contras. And it very much embarrassed the Reagan administration because he said publicly he was not going to negotiate with terrorists. And one of the reasons we were selling these weapons to Iran was because they were going to help us get some American hostages free. Reagan claimed he didn't have anything to do with it. So the administration suffers a blow in its popularity.

The US and the Soviet Union are going to be a key part of this story as well. Cold War tensions increased under Reagan with all these different US interventions. But it's important to note also that his relationship with Gorbachev who comes to power in 1985 is going to be hugely important. Gorbachev comes to power in 1985 and begins a series of reforms. The economy of the Soviet Union was in awful shape. The arms race was costing them so much money. And their economy had just kind of declined. And he starts a series of reforms. One is known as glasnost -- or openness -- greater political freedom. And the other one is perestroika -- this is slowly implemented capitalist reforms letting free market ideas and practices into Soviet society.

These reforms dramatically transformed the Soviet Union. And then partly as a result you're going to see huge changes in the Cold War. Gorbachev is going to pull back in places such as Eastern Europe. He basically says we're no longer going to support these countries. And in places like Poland you're going to see independence movements and eventually the formation of non-communist countries in that once place in that place once called the Iron Curtain.

You're also going to see famous kind of moments during the Cold War. Reagan in 1987 speaking in Germany saying "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall" at Brandenburg Gate right there in front of the Berlin Wall. And so all of these things are changing very rapidly. You're going to have arms control agreements as well. And the most famous one is in 1987 -- Gorbachev and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (the INF Treaty) which eliminates those weapons from both the US and the Soviet arsenals.

And not too long after Reagan leaves office, the Cold War will finally come to an end. It had been going through periods of intense conflict to periods of relaxation of tensions. And you're going to see the Cold War end due to a variety of factors. There are political and economic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Here you see people kind of climbing at top the Berlin Wall. The reforms in the Soviet Union coupled with the huge problems the Soviet economy was having. All of this kind of begins to finalize this process that had been going on for a while. Increased US military spending kind of made the Soviets unable to compete which contributes to the downfall of the Soviet Union.

You have Reagan's diplomatic initiatives where the US and the Soviets are negotiating especially that relationship between Gorbachev and Reagan. And by 1991 you are going to have the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union will cease to exist. You're going to have coup and various former Soviet republics declaring independence. And the Soviet Union will come to an end. And this will be under George Bush at the end of the Cold War.

This required the US to redefine its role in the world. This is really important but later on. And the big thing is going to be following attacks on 9/11 -- the focus became fighting terrorism. So no longer was the enemy a very clear target -- the Soviet Union. It's going to be much more difficult in this post-Cold War world because the enemy is not one nation. It is this terrorist threat.

Couple things about George Bush you should know just really quickly. He is elected in 1988. And kind of one of the big events you should know is the Persian Gulf War or what was known as Operation Desert Storm. In 1990, Iraq under the leadership of Saddam Hussein they invaded neighboring Kuwait. Kuwait was a very oil-rich country. Saddam Hussein invades it. And the United States enters on behalf of Kuwait into a fight. A US-led coalition. And they ultimately removed Iraqi troops and liberated Kuwait. This was a joint effort with other countries with the US playing a huge role in the war.

One last thing about Reagan and Bush presidencies. You're going to get the rise of a conservative Supreme Court. Remember this is in sharp contrast with the decisions of the Warren Court which was around from 1953 to 1969 led by Earl Warren. You're going to get more conservative justices. Famously Sandra Day O'Connor is nominated to the Supreme Court in 1981. She is the first woman. And she is nominated by Ronald Reagan. You're going to get other conservative justices like Antonin Scalia who just passed away in 2016. Clarence Thomas is nominated by George Bush. There's a huge battle over his confirmation because of sexual harassment charges. And the court under these more conservative judges are going to do things like allow states to place restrictions on abortion. So parents had to be notified in one of the cases the court rules. And affirmative action policies were rolled back. So they rule in a much more conservative way than previous courts had.

That's going to do it for today. You are almost to the finish line. Make sure before you take the AP exam you eat a good meal. I love street tacos but it's probably not the best bet just before you're going to sit for an over three-hour test. Good luck in May. Have a beautiful day. Make sure you subscribe. And peace.
