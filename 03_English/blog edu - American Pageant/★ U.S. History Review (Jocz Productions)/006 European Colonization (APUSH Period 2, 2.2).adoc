What's up, beautiful people? Today I'm going to explain European colonization 殖民；殖民地化. And although they were the first, Spain and Portugal were not the only countries seeking to establish themselves a colonial empire in the New World — that was so new that millions of Native Americans were already living there.

Evidence 证据；证明 of this colonization can even be seen in the place names of the United States. These are just a few examples. In addition, many U.S. states got their name from some variation 变体；变种 of American Indian words. In the comments, let me know where you are watching from and the origin 起源；来源 of your city or state name.

As we've already seen, the Spanish were the first to set up sustained 持续的 settlements in the Western Hemisphere, and they were also the first to settle what is today Los Estados Unidos. The first permanent 永久的 colonial settlement in North America will be Spain's Saint Augustine in Florida in 1565.

Spain was primarily 主要地；首要地 in the colonial game in an effort to extract 提取；提炼 wealth from the land — that's fancy talk for basically pillaging 掠夺；抢劫 the wealth they found amongst groups such as the Aztecs and Incas, and then mining like crazy for more gold and silver. In this effort, Spain developed institutions 机构；制度 for subjugating 征服；镇压 native populations — you know, making them do the unbelievably difficult and deadly work we've seen in the encomienda system （西班牙在美洲殖民地的）委托监护制.

Both native people and increasingly enslaved 奴役；束缚 (and some free) African people will be incorporated 包含；吸收 into the Spanish colonial society — a society we have seen that was very much defined by a rigid 严格的；僵化的 social hierarchy 等级制度.

As for what's going down in Spanish settlements in North America, the region was known as New Spain. The primary method of claiming the land was the development of the Spanish mission system 传教体系, which sought to convert 使改变（宗教或信仰）；使皈依 native people to Catholicism 天主教.

Now you probably have noticed this video as being done with me speaking the English, and although I'm sure not up to the Queen's expectations — hello, Queen — we know the British are also gonna be in the colonial game. In 1607, the British will establish their first permanent settlement at Jamestown.

Before we dive into 探究；深入了解 the British colonies though, in 1608 the French colony of Quebec was established. This dreamy-eyed gentleman named Samuel de Champlain will be known as the father of New France. In the blue, you can see what the colony of New France will look like by 1750. For the most part, the colony was settled by fur traders and some Catholic missionaries 传教士, as well as some soldiers who would man 操纵；驻守 the forts 堡垒；要塞 built throughout New France's vast 广阔的 territory 领土；版图.

In 1609, this guy who looks like a human wearing one of those things you put on your dog to keep it from biting its own skin — Henry Hudson — was chosen by the Dutch East India Company in the Netherlands to find an easterly passage to Asia. He didn't find Asia, but he did get a river named after him, and his reports about fertile 肥沃的 soil and furry animals perfect for fur trading inspired Dutch merchants to fund more expeditions 远征；探险.

The Dutch got in the mix when they established their colonial settlement of New Amsterdam in 1624. The colony of New Netherlands was established by the Dutch West India Company, a joint stock company 股份公司 primarily seeking to capitalize off of 利用……获利 the fur trade. Eventually this included all of present-day New York City and parts of Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey. And I'm sure you already knew this because when you think of New York City, you think of the sick Dutch fashion.

New France and New Amsterdam colonists were primarily motivated by economic motives. Colonists, especially when it came to New France, relied on trade alliances 联盟 and intermarriages 异族通婚 with American Indians to build economic and diplomatic 外交的 relationships. The main activity and the purpose for establishing these settlements with the local peeps was the fur trade, and so it was important to have good relations with American Indians. Remember, these colonists are in the Native Americans' home — they knew where to find these cute furry things.

While compared to other white people in North America, English colonization efforts attracted large numbers of British migrants 移民. You could see by 1700 they will have roughly 250,000 colonists, whereas you could see here the French will only have around 15,000 settlers by that same year. It is important to note both the Dutch and the French colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans. This fact I think proves once and for all when you're looking at a map, the size of your colonial holdings isn't everything.

But here's where this history stuff gets complicated. Each of the 13 colonies will have its own unique set of circumstances 情况；情形, motives 动机；原因 for colonization, and people who come. For instance, Jamestown will be reigning men for much of its early period with very few women making the journey. In the New England colony, starting with the peeps who came over on the Mayflower and established Plymouth in 1620, there will be much more of an even ratio 比率；比例 of men and women that came to these Puritan 清教徒的 settlements. And in the middle colonies, you will see not only British migrants but also other European migrants such as the Dutch.

In British colonial society, you can click the video in the description to learn more about the British colonies, but basically the motivation behind colonization of the British colonies included a desire for social mobility 流动性；迁移率 — you know, "started from the bottom now we here." Of course, social mobility can be achieved by trying to get economic prosperity 繁荣. This will be the primary motivation behind the settlement of the Jamestown colony in the Chesapeake.

Others coming to the British colonies were fleeing 逃离；逃避 political or religious conflict 冲突. Religious freedom would be the primary motive behind the establishment of the New England colonies up there in the north. So you have also religious freedom playing a role. And finally, still others came to the British colonies in an attempt to improve their living conditions.

Unlike the Spanish, no gold or silver will be found in any of the 13 British colonies. For the most part, it's going to be all about that agricultural 农业的 life. And unlike Spanish colonization with most colonization efforts being financed 资助；提供资金 by the crown, English colonization oftentimes allowed private individuals and joint stock companies to colonize on behalf of England.

Joint stock companies such as the Virginia Company was a way to finance colonial settlements, with the basic idea behind the joint stock company being for a group of investors to be able to share the risk and possible profits from a colonial settlement. As you can see, many British colonies were financed by joint stock companies.

And in terms of their relationship with their Native American neighbors, there won't be any interest in converting them to any religion or using them as a source of labor like the Spanish did, nor will there be much attempt at fostering 促进；培养 a sustained long-term trade partnership like the French and Dutch. For the most part in the British colonies, they just wanted the land and would prefer that Native American people bugger off 离开；滚开.

Until our next topic — the regions of British colonies — I'm gonna bugger off, but be sure to tell me in the comments where you are watching from and what's the origin of that place. And thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我将解释欧洲的殖民化。尽管西班牙和葡萄牙是第一批，但它们并不是唯一寻求在新世界建立殖民帝国的国家——那里如此之“新”，以至于数百万美洲原住民已经居住在那里了。

这种殖民化的证据甚至可以在美国的地名中看到。这只是一些例子。此外，许多美国州的名称都来源于美洲印第安语的某种变体。请在评论中告诉我您正在哪里观看，以及您的城市或州名的由来。

正如我们已经看到的，西班牙人是第一个在西半球建立持续定居点的国家，他们也是第一个在今天的美利坚合众国定居的国家。北美洲第一个永久性殖民定居点将是西班牙于 1565 年在佛罗里达建立的圣奥古斯丁。

西班牙主要参与殖民活动是为了从这片土地上攫取财富——这是一种委婉的说法，基本上就是掠夺他们在阿兹特克和印加等民族中发现的财富，然后疯狂地开采更多的黄金和白银。为了实现这一目标，西班牙建立了一套制度来征服当地居民——你知道的，让他们从事我们在恩科米enda制度中看到的那种难以置信的艰苦和致命的工作。

当地居民和越来越多的被奴役的（以及一些自由的）非洲人将被纳入西班牙殖民社会——我们已经看到，这是一个等级森严的社会。

至于北美西班牙殖民地的发展情况，该地区被称为新西班牙。主要的土地占领方式是发展西班牙的传教团制度，该制度旨在使当地居民皈依天主教。

现在你可能已经注意到这个视频是用我说的英语制作的，虽然我肯定达不到女王陛下的期望——你好，女王陛下——但我们知道英国人也将参与殖民活动。1607 年，英国将在詹姆斯敦建立他们的第一个永久性定居点。

但在我们深入探讨英国殖民地之前，1608 年，法国的魁北克殖民地建立。这位眼神迷离的绅士塞缪尔·德·尚普兰将被誉为新法兰西之父。在蓝色区域，你可以看到到 1750 年新法兰西殖民地的样子。在很大程度上，该殖民地是由毛皮商人、一些天主教传教士以及一些驻守在新法兰西广阔领土上建造的堡垒的士兵定居的。

1609 年，这位看起来像人类戴着防止狗舔舐皮肤的颈圈的人——亨利·哈德逊——被荷兰的荷兰东印度公司选中，去寻找一条通往亚洲的东向航道。他没有找到亚洲，但他得到了一条以他名字命名的河流，并且他关于肥沃土壤和适合毛皮贸易的毛皮动物的报告激发了荷兰商人资助更多的探险活动。

荷兰人在 1624 年建立他们的殖民定居点新阿姆斯特丹时加入了竞争。新尼德兰殖民地由荷兰西印度公司建立，这是一家主要寻求从毛皮贸易中获利的股份公司。最终，这包括了今天的整个纽约市以及长岛、康涅狄格州和新泽西州的部分地区。我相信你已经知道了这一点，因为当你想到纽约市时，你会想到时髦的荷兰时尚。

新法兰西和新阿姆斯特丹的殖民者主要是受经济动机驱使。殖民者，尤其是在新法兰西，依靠与美洲印第安人的贸易联盟和通婚来建立经济和外交关系。与当地居民建立这些定居点的主要活动和目的是毛皮贸易，因此与美洲印第安人保持良好关系非常重要。记住，这些殖民者是在美洲原住民的家园里——他们知道在哪里能找到这些可爱的小毛皮动物。

与北美洲的其他白人相比，英国的殖民努力吸引了大量的英国移民。你可以看到到 1700 年，他们将拥有大约 25 万殖民者，而法国在同一年只有大约 1.5 万定居者。重要的是要注意，荷兰和法国的殖民努力都只涉及相对较少的欧洲人。我认为这个事实最终证明，当你查看地图时，你的殖民地面积大小并不是一切。

但历史就是在这里变得复杂的。13 个殖民地中的每一个都有其独特的环境、殖民动机和移民人口。例如，詹姆斯敦在其早期的大部分时间里都是男性为主，很少有女性前往。在新英格兰殖民地，从乘坐五月花号来到并在 1620 年建立普利茅斯的那些人开始，来到这些清教徒定居点的男女比例要均衡得多。而在中部殖民地，你不仅会看到英国移民，还会看到其他欧洲移民，如荷兰人。

在英国殖民社会中，你可以点击描述中的视频以了解更多关于英国殖民地的信息，但基本上，英国殖民地殖民背后的动机包括对社会流动的渴望——你知道的，“从底层做起，现在我们在这里了。”当然，社会流动可以通过努力获得经济繁荣来实现。这将是切萨皮克地区詹姆斯敦殖民地建立的主要动机。

来到英国殖民地的其他人是为了逃离政治或宗教冲突。宗教自由将是北部新英格兰殖民地建立的主要动机。所以宗教自由也发挥了作用。最后，还有一些人来到英国殖民地是为了改善他们的生活条件。

与西班牙人不同，在 13 个英国殖民地中都没有发现黄金或白银。在很大程度上，这将完全是农业生活。与西班牙殖民化中大部分殖民活动由王室资助不同，英国的殖民化通常允许私人和股份公司代表英国进行殖民。

像弗吉尼亚公司这样的股份公司是为殖民定居点融资的一种方式，股份公司的基本理念是让一群投资者能够分担殖民定居点的风险和可能的利润。正如你所看到的，许多英国殖民地都是由股份公司资助的。

就他们与美洲原住民邻居的关系而言，他们不会像西班牙人那样有兴趣让他们皈依任何宗教或将其用作劳动力来源，也不会像法国人和荷兰人那样大力尝试建立持续的长期贸易伙伴关系。在英国殖民地，他们大多只是想要土地，并且希望美洲原住民滚开。

在我们下一个主题——英国殖民地的地区——之前，我要滚开了，但请务必在评论中告诉我您正在哪里观看，以及那个地方的由来。非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
