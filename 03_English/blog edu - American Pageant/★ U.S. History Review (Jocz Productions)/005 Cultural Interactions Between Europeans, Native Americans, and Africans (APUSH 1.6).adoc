What's up, beautiful people? Today we're taking a look at cultural interactions 互动；相互作用 between Europeans, Native Americans and Africans.

By the end of the 16th century, Spain had control over 控制；掌管 most of South America, Central America, parts of the Caribbean, and what would become Mexico and the American Southwest and Florida. As you can see on this map, this was a vast 广阔的 territory 领土；版图 that was connected by Catholic missions 传教活动 and forts 堡垒；要塞, which not only sought to defend Spanish territory from other European nations but also forced indigenous 土著的；本土的 people to work and convert to 使改变（宗教或信仰）；使皈依 Catholicism 天主教.

An important part of Spanish colonization 殖民；殖民地化 of the Americas will be the development of the mission system, especially in what is today California, the American Southwest and even Florida. It would be these missions led by Franciscan priests that would carry forth Spanish claims to the land.

An important point: this colonization by various European powers was built on the belief that European civilization was superior 更好的；占优势的 — or basically the view that the indigenous people were... "There's so much we can teach you. We've improved the lives of savages 野蛮人 all over the world... savages."

In their interactions, Europeans and Native Americans asserted 坚持；维护 divergent 不同的；有分歧的 world views regarding issues such as religion, gender roles 角色, family, land use and power. As Europeans began to kind of take Native American land and demand more and more of their labor, native people utilize 利用 different methods of resistance 抵抗；反抗. They're not gonna take it.

In spite of 尽管 European colonization, tribes work to preserve 保护；维护 their traditional tribal culture, beliefs, language and world views. Rather than accept or adapt to 适应 European ways and beliefs, many tribes worked to preserve their traditional tribal culture, beliefs, language and world views rather than accept or adapt to European ways and beliefs.

While their political and linguistic 语言的 differences hindered 阻碍；妨碍 their ability to mount 发动；组织 a united opposition 反对；反抗 to European colonization, native people sought to preserve their cultural autonomy 自治；自主. This included their political sovereignty 主权, their economic prosperity 繁荣, religious beliefs and concepts of gender relations.

To do this, some tribes relied on diplomatic 外交的 negotiations 谈判 and/or forming trade relations with European settlers. This is definitely gonna be the case when it came to the French colonists that we'll cover in another video. Other tribes used military 军事的 resistance as the means in which to maintain their native sovereignty.

The most famous of this resistance can be seen in the Pueblo Revolt, also known as Pope's Rebellion by the cool history kids. By the 17th century, Spain had established settlement in the Southwest. Unfortunately for them, they did not find any gold or silver in this region, but what Spain did find was a bunch of native people to try to convert to Catholicism.

Tired of the poor treatment by the Spanish, under the leadership of a man named Pope, the native people in the region in 1680 mounted a revolution 革命 against Spanish economic, religious and political control of the region. This was the only successful native uprising 起义；暴动 against a colonizing power in North America, as the revolt 反抗；叛乱 of the Pueblo people led to the death of hundreds of Spanish colonists and the destruction 破坏；毁灭 of churches and forts in the area.

Spain was forced to leave the area for about 12 years, and when they returned, Spain was forced to allow the Pueblo people to retain 保留；保持 many of their cultural traditions. Even after when some Pueblo people adopted elements of Christianity, they often retain their own spiritual 精神的；心灵的 beliefs and gods.

Over time, extended 长期的 contact with Native Americans and Africans fostered 促进；培养 a debate among European religious and political leaders about how non-Europeans should be treated. They're not going to treat them well, as well as evolving 逐渐发展的 religious, cultural and racial 种族的 justifications 正当理由；合理解释 for the subjugation 征服；镇压 of Africans and Native Americans.

Sadly, most of colonization was about justifying the subjugation of non-European people. For instance, Juan de Sepúlveda wrote *The Just Causes for War Against the Indians*, and in it he justified 证明…有理 Spanish colonization of the Americas, basically saying native people were not fit for self-government, enslaving them was for their own good, and Spain was bringing all sorts of civilization — blah blah blah. You know, typical oppressor 压迫者 colonization type stuff.

The brutality 残忍；野蛮 of the Spanish conquistadors （16世纪的）西班牙征服者 was questioned by some, such as by the Spaniard de las Casas. In 1552, he published *A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies*, which documented 记录；记载 the abuses 虐待；伤害 committed during Spanish colonization. Casas was one of the few folks who spoke out in favor of 支持；赞同 protecting Native Americans from abuse by Spanish colonization.

Eventually, other European nations such as France, the Dutch and England will seek to establish colonial settlements in North America, and each one of those countries will also come into contact with indigenous people, which will utilize various methods of resistance and accommodation 迁就；适应. And in our next video, we will cover exactly that topic: European colonization.

Until then, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我们来探讨欧洲人、美洲原住民和非洲人之间的文化互动。

到 16 世纪末，西班牙控制了南美洲的大部分地区、中美洲、加勒比海的部分地区，以及后来的墨西哥、美国西南部和佛罗里达。正如你在地图上看到的，这是一个广阔的领土，由天主教传教团和堡垒连接起来，这些传教团和堡垒不仅旨在保卫西班牙领土免受其他欧洲国家的侵犯，还强迫当地居民劳动并皈依天主教。

西班牙在美洲殖民的一个重要部分将是传教团制度的发展，尤其是在今天的加利福尼亚、美国西南部甚至佛罗里达。正是这些由方济各会神父领导的传教团将推进西班牙对这片土地的主张。

一个重要的观点：各种欧洲强权的这种殖民统治建立在欧洲文明优越的信念之上——或者基本上是认为当地居民是……“我们有很多可以教你们的。我们改善了全世界野蛮人的生活……野蛮人。”

在他们的互动中，欧洲人和美洲原住民在宗教、性别角色、家庭、土地使用和权力等问题上持有不同的世界观。随着欧洲人开始侵占美洲原住民的土地并越来越要求他们的劳动，当地居民采取了不同的抵抗方式。他们不会就此罢休。

尽管受到欧洲的殖民统治，各部落仍努力保护其传统的部落文化、信仰、语言和世界观。许多部落没有接受或适应欧洲的方式和信仰，而是努力保护其传统的部落文化、信仰、语言和世界观，而不是接受或适应欧洲的方式和信仰。

虽然他们的政治和语言差异阻碍了他们形成统一的反对欧洲殖民的力量，但当地居民寻求维护他们的文化自主权。这包括他们的政治主权、经济繁荣、宗教信仰和性别关系观念。

为了做到这一点，一些部落依赖于与欧洲定居者进行外交谈判和/或建立贸易关系。当我们讨论将在另一个视频中介绍的法国殖民者时，情况肯定会是这样。其他部落则使用军事抵抗作为维护其本土主权的方式。

这种抵抗最著名的例子可以在普韦布罗起义中看到，酷历史爱好者也称之为波佩的叛乱。到 17 世纪，西班牙已在西南部建立了定居点。对他们来说不幸的是，他们没有在该地区发现任何黄金或白银，但西班牙确实发现了一群当地居民，并试图让他们皈依天主教。

由于厌倦了西班牙人的恶劣待遇，在一位名叫波佩的人的领导下，该地区的当地居民于 1680 年发动了一场反对西班牙对该地区经济、宗教和政治控制的革命。这是北美洲针对殖民强权的唯一一次成功的当地人起义，普韦布罗人的起义导致数百名西班牙殖民者死亡，以及该地区教堂和堡垒的摧毁。

西班牙被迫离开该地区约 12 年，当他们返回时，西班牙被迫允许普韦布罗人保留他们的许多文化传统。即使在一些普韦布罗人采纳了基督教的一些元素之后，他们通常仍然保留着自己的精神信仰和神祇。

随着时间的推移，与美洲原住民和非洲人的长期接触促使欧洲宗教和政治领导人就如何对待非欧洲人展开辩论。他们不会善待他们，以及为奴役非洲人和美洲原住民而逐渐形成的宗教、文化和种族理由。

可悲的是，大多数殖民化都是为了证明对非欧洲人的奴役是正当的。例如，胡安·德·塞普尔维达写了《论征服印第安人的正当理由》，他在书中为西班牙殖民美洲辩护，基本上说当地居民不适合自治，奴役他们是为了他们好，西班牙带来了各种文明——等等等等。你知道的，典型的压迫者殖民的那一套。

一些人，如西班牙人德拉斯卡萨斯，质疑了西班牙征服者的残酷行为。1552 年，他出版了《西印度毁灭述略》，记录了西班牙殖民期间犯下的暴行。卡萨斯是少数公开支持保护美洲原住民免受西班牙殖民虐待的人之一。

最终，其他欧洲国家，如法国、荷兰和英国，将寻求在北美建立殖民地，而这些国家中的每一个都将与当地居民接触，当地居民将采取各种抵抗和适应的方法。在我们的下一个视频中，我们将专门讨论这个话题：欧洲的殖民化。

在那之前，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
