What's up, beautiful people? Today we're taking a look at the Columbian Exchange, Spanish exploration and conquest 征服；控制. And even though Columbus wasn't the first white dude to make it to the Americas, his arrival does begin the process known as the Columbian Exchange.

The Columbian Exchange is the transfer 转移；迁移 of people, food, animals, minerals 矿物, diseases, ideas, resources and all sorts of other stuff between Europe, Africa and the Western Hemisphere. This process will transform 使改变形态；使改变外观（或性质） these regions.

Clearly one of the most devastating 毁灭性的 impacts was the European introduction of diseases to the Western Hemisphere. Smallpox 天花 was the most devastating, but you also have influenza 流感, yellow fever 黄热病, malaria 疟疾. And native people had no immunity 免疫力 to these diseases brought about by contact.

Although the biggest reason for the population decline 下降 of native people was the introduction of diseases — remember, germs 细菌；病菌 devastated 毁坏；摧毁 native populations — guns would also play a role in conquest of the Americas and cause cultural and demographic 人口结构的 change amongst many Native American societies.

Foods from the Americas such as potato, corn and tomatoes were introduced to Europe. As the diets of Europeans got better, items like corn and potato would help fuel 加强；刺激 population growth in Europe. In addition, potatoes being introduced to Europe as a result of the Columbian Exchange brought the world French fries. And in the comments, put who you think has the tastiest French fries at a fast food joint 关节；公共场所.

Europeans also brought domesticated 驯养的 animals such as cows and horses to the Western Hemisphere. And the introduction of these new animals will alter 改变；变更 life for many tribes, especially when it comes to the introduction of the horse on the Great Plains region. Horses allowed tribes such as the Sioux people to be more mobile 流动的；移动的, which increased efficiency 效率；效能 during the hunting of the bison 野牛, but also increased inter-tribal contact and warfare 战争；冲突.

No matter what part of the Columbian Exchange we are talking about, Native American societies changed as a result of trade and contact with Europeans.

The influx 涌入；汇集 of new sources of mineral wealth — especially gold and silver, like that gold bar that was dropped by one of the Spanish invaders 侵略者 — accelerated 加速；加快 the transition 转变；过渡 from feudalism 封建主义 to capitalism 资本主义 over in Europe. This wealth early on would propel 推动；驱使 Spain into quite the economic and maritime 海洋的；航海的 powerhouse 强大的集团（或国家） of the 16th century.

And yes, Portugal does claim land in the Americas, namely Brazil. But Spain is clearly numero uno (first 第一), as they claimed huge chunks 厚块；大块 of land in the Western Hemisphere, as you can see in the blue.

While a lot of Europeans will come to the Americas looking to duplicate 复制；重复 the haul 大量赃物；一网的鱼 of Cortez and Pizarro, the truth is most of these expeditions 远征；探险 will not find gold or silver. For example, Hernando de Soto wanted also to find that dinero (money 钱). He led expeditions in Florida in 1539 to 1541 and came up short on finding the loot 赃物；战利品, but he was the first gringo (对外国白人的蔑称) to cross the Mississippi River.

Francisco Coronado explored north of Mexico in 1540, and Coronado went into what is today New Mexico looking for that bling (珠宝；财富), but he also came up with nada (nothing 没有什么). His expeditions did, though, provide Spain the ability to claim the American Southwest for the Spanish Empire.

Most of the wealth generated by the colonies — whether they be the Spanish, French or English colonies — would later on come from goods such as tobacco 烟草, rice, fur 毛皮, and the big one, especially in the Caribbean: sugar.

The Columbian Exchange also brought new languages to the Western Hemisphere. You have Portuguese spoken in Brazil and Spanish spoken across many different countries throughout Latin America. Undoubtedly 无疑；肯定, each indigenous 土著的；本土的 tribe had their own language and culture — something that was overlooked 忽略；未注意到 by the European colonists — and language played a large role in the colonization process.

Catholicism 天主教 was also brought to the Western Hemisphere as a result of the Columbian Exchange, and the Catholic Church served as a tool of subjugation 征服；镇压；克制 of native people. And Catholic missions 传教活动 were set up to convert 使改变（宗教或信仰）；使皈依 native people to Catholicism. So another result of the Columbian Exchange and Spanish colonization was Catholicism was brought to the Western Hemisphere.

And finally, another part of the Columbian Exchange is the transfer of people. And in our next video, I will explore labor 劳动；劳工, slavery 奴隶制；奴役 and caste 种姓（按照血统、阶级、财富等严格区分的社会等级） in the Spanish colonial system. Until then, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我们来探讨哥伦布大交换、西班牙的探险和征服。尽管哥伦布并不是第一个到达美洲的白人，但他的到来确实开启了一个被称为哥伦布大交换的过程。

哥伦布大交换是指欧洲、非洲和西半球之间的人口、食物、动物、矿产、疾病、思想、资源和各种其他事物的转移。这个过程将改变这些地区。

显然，最具破坏性的影响之一是欧洲将疾病引入西半球。天花是最具毁灭性的，但还有流感、黄热病、疟疾。而当地居民对这些因接触而带来的疾病没有任何免疫力。

尽管当地人口下降的最大原因是疾病的引入——记住，细菌摧毁了当地人口——枪支也在美洲的征服中发挥了作用，并导致许多美洲原住民社会发生文化和人口结构的变化。

来自美洲的食物，如土豆、玉米和西红柿被引入欧洲。随着欧洲人的饮食改善，玉米和土豆等作物有助于欧洲人口的增长。此外，由于哥伦布大交换，土豆被引入欧洲，为世界带来了炸薯条。请在评论中写下你认为哪家快餐店的炸薯条最好吃。

欧洲人还将牛和马等家畜带到了西半球。这些新动物的引入将改变许多部落的生活，尤其是在大平原地区引入马匹之后。马匹使得苏族等部落能够更加灵活地行动，这提高了野牛狩猎的效率，但也增加了部落间的接触和战争。

无论我们谈论哥伦布大交换的哪个方面，美洲原住民社会都因与欧洲人的贸易和接触而发生了变化。

新的矿产财富——特别是黄金和白银的涌入——就像西班牙入侵者掉落的那块金条一样——加速了欧洲从封建主义向资本主义的过渡。这笔财富早期将推动西班牙成为 16 世纪相当强大的经济和海上强国。

是的，葡萄牙确实在美洲声称拥有土地，即巴西。但西班牙显然是第一名，正如你在蓝色区域所见，他们在西半球声称拥有大片土地。

虽然许多欧洲人来到美洲是为了复制科尔特斯和皮萨罗的掠夺，但事实是，大多数探险队并没有找到黄金或白银。例如，埃尔南多·德·索托也想找到那些钱财。他在 1539 年至 1541 年间率领探险队进入佛罗里达，但未能找到宝藏，但他却是第一个跨越密西西比河的白人。

弗朗西斯科·科罗纳多于 1540 年在墨西哥北部进行了探险，科罗纳多进入了今天的的新墨西哥州寻找那些闪闪发光的财物，但他也没有找到任何东西。然而，他的探险确实为西班牙提供了将美国西南部纳入西班牙帝国的机会。

殖民地——无论是西班牙、法国还是英国的殖民地——产生的大部分财富，后来都来自烟草、大米、毛皮以及最重要的商品，尤其是在加勒比地区：糖。

哥伦布大交换也为西半球带来了新的语言。巴西说葡萄牙语，而拉丁美洲许多不同的国家都说西班牙语。毫无疑问，每个土著部落都有自己的语言和文化——这被欧洲殖民者所忽视——而语言在殖民化进程中发挥了重要作用。

天主教也作为哥伦布大交换的结果被带到了西半球，天主教会成为压迫当地居民的工具。并且建立了天主教传教团，以使当地居民皈依天主教。因此，哥伦布大交换和西班牙殖民的另一个结果是将天主教带到了西半球。

最后，哥伦布大交换的另一个部分是人口的转移。在我们的下一个视频中，我将探讨西班牙殖民体系中的劳动力、奴隶制和种姓制度。在那之前，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
