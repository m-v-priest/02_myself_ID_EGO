What's up 怎么了, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. In this video, I will be quickly explaining the Constitution of the United States 美国宪法.

There were a lot of differences between the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例 and the Constitution. The Constitution gave the federal government 联邦政府 the power to tax 征税权. The Constitution had a president in the executive branch 行政部门. The national government could regulate trade 监管贸易. And there were changes to the makeup of the legislative branch 立法部门 and how representation 代表权 was handled. In addition, under the Constitution, federal power is superior to state power 州权 -- more on that in just a moment.

In spite of all these changes, there were some continuities 延续性 between the two documents. What was established in both after the American Revolution was not another monarchy 君主制. Both the Articles and the Constitution created a republic 共和政体. At the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议, the delegates 代表 from the various states created a central government with dramatically increased powers from the Articles of Confederation.

In spite of these increased powers of the federal government, the framers 制宪者 still created a central government with limits to its power. Don't get it confused and think the federal government is some nearly unstoppable force 不可阻挡的力量 under the Constitution.

The first thing to note about the new federal government was that they created a system of government known as federalism 联邦主义. Federalism is a system in which power is split between a national government (or federal government) and the state governments. Federalism means some power is shared between the federal government and the various state governments. And it's important to know a stronger federal government does not mean the states lose all of their powers.

Let me show you what this looks like in practice. Under the Constitution, certain powers are delegated to 授予 the national government. For instance, the power to coin money 铸币权, declare war 宣战权, international affairs 外交事务, deliver the mail 邮政服务, interstate and international trade 州际与国际贸易 are all powers granted to the national government. There are also powers not granted specifically to the federal government that fall to the states. Things such as regulating business within the state or intrastate trade 州内贸易, education 教育, and others you see on the list are all powers that the state government still retain 保留. And under the Constitution, there are also powers shared by both the federal and state governments. This is federalism. One of these powers that is shared is the power to tax.

Now, Article Six of the Constitution is known as the Supremacy Clause 最高条款. Basically what it says is the Constitution is the supreme law of the land 国家最高法律. What this means is if a state and federal law contradict one another, the federal law is supreme. In other words, federal law supersedes 取代 state laws when a conflict exists.

In order to establish limits on the power of the federal government, the framers of the Constitution provided for a separation of powers 权力分立 between the three branches of government. The legislative branch 立法部门 makes the law. The executive branch 行政部门 implements and enforces the laws 执行法律. And the judicial branch 司法部门 interprets the laws 解释法律. The power of the Supreme Court to really interpret the law will come later with the Supreme Court case of Marbury versus Madison in 1803. I will be talking about this case in another video, but for now -- foreshadowing 伏笔.

This system of separation of powers was created in order for the different branches to be able to check one another. Checks and balances 制衡机制 allows for the individual branches of government to restrict the power of the different branches. Examples of these checks and balances are as follows: Congress makes the law, but a president can veto 否决 the law. Congress can still get a law that has been vetoed passed by getting a two-thirds majority vote 三分之二多数票 in both houses of Congress. And the judicial branch can determine whether or not a law is unconstitutional 违宪 or not. There are many other examples of checks and balances. If you want to know more, hit pause and soak up 吸收 all this government goodness you see right there.

Another thing to note about the Constitution is that it is considered a living document 活文件. By a living document, I do not mean the Constitution is walking around saying hello and raiding your fridge of your roommate Sam Adams' beer. The Constitution is known as a living document because it can be amended 修正. Although in over 200 years, there have only been 27 amendments 修正案. Remember, even the Bill of Rights 权利法案 was included after the Constitutional Convention of 1787.

The purpose of the Bill of Rights was to secure and protect the rights not explicitly stated 明确表述 in the Constitution. For instance, even though the Constitution created a stronger national government, the 10th Amendment reads: "The powers not delegated to the US are reserved to the states 保留给各州."

To give you an idea of the dynamic nature 动态特性 of the Constitution, the following things were not in the original document: two-term presidential term limits 总统任期限制, the direct election of senators 参议员直选, slavery being unconstitutional 奴隶制违宪. And some historians argued the Constitution was not a democratic document. In the Constitution, there were all sorts of checks on the democratic process 民主进程. The electoral college 选举人团 was created to protect the vote of the presidency from the whims 一时兴起 of the population. In the original Constitution, senators were actually selected by state legislatures 州议会 rather than the voting public. In many ways, the Constitution as originally designed was designed to check the popular will 民意 of the people.

Fortunately, amendments to the Constitution -- at least seven of them -- will dramatically address the lack of voting rights 投票权 for various groups in American society. Sadly, it's going to take a long time for some groups to attain even that basic right -- the right to vote.

And in our next video, we will get this Constitution in full effect and look at the topic: Shaping a New Republic 塑造新共和国. Until next time, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。在这个视频中，我将快速解释一下美利坚合众国宪法。

邦联条例和宪法之间存在许多差异。宪法赋予联邦政府征税的权力。宪法在行政部门设立了总统。国家政府可以 регулировать 贸易。立法部门的组成和代表权的分配方式也发生了变化。此外，根据宪法，联邦权力高于州权力——稍后会详细介绍。

尽管发生了所有这些变化，这两份文件之间仍然存在一些连续性。美国革命后建立的都不是另一个君主制。邦联条例和宪法都建立了一个共和国。在制宪会议上，来自各州的代表建立了一个中央政府，其权力比邦联条例下的权力大大增加。

尽管联邦政府的权力有所增加，但制宪者仍然建立了一个权力受到限制的中央政府。不要混淆，认为联邦政府在宪法下是某种几乎不可阻挡的力量。

关于新的联邦政府，首先要注意的是他们创建了一种称为联邦制的政府体系。联邦制是一种权力在国家政府（或联邦政府）和州政府之间分配的体系。联邦制意味着联邦政府和各州政府之间共享某些权力。重要的是要了解，更强大的联邦政府并不意味着各州失去所有权力。

让我用实践中的例子来展示一下。根据宪法，某些权力被授予国家政府。例如，铸币权、宣战权、国际事务权、邮政权、州际和国际贸易权都是授予国家政府的权力。还有一些权力没有明确授予联邦政府，而是属于各州。诸如 регулировать 州内商业或州内贸易、教育以及你在清单上看到的其他事项，都是州政府仍然保留的权力。根据宪法，联邦政府和州政府也共享某些权力。这就是联邦制。共享的权力之一是征税权。

现在，宪法第六条被称为至上条款。基本上，它规定宪法是国家的最高法律。这意味着如果州法律和联邦法律相互冲突，联邦法律至上。换句话说，当存在冲突时，联邦法律优先于州法律。

为了限制联邦政府的权力，宪法的制定者规定了政府三个部门之间的权力分立。立法部门制定法律。行政部门执行和实施法律。司法部门解释法律。最高法院真正解释法律的权力将在 1803 年马伯里诉麦迪逊案的最高法院判决后确立。我将在另一个视频中讨论这个案件，但现在——伏笔。

创建这种权力分立体系是为了让不同的部门能够相互制约。制约与平衡允许政府的各个部门限制不同部门的权力。这些制约与平衡的例子如下：国会制定法律，但总统可以否决该法律。国会仍然可以通过在国会两院获得三分之二多数票来推翻总统的否决，使法律得以通过。司法部门可以裁定一项法律是否违宪。还有许多其他的制约与平衡的例子。如果你想了解更多，请暂停视频，仔细阅读你所看到的这些关于政府的精彩内容。

关于宪法，另一点需要注意的是，它被认为是一部活的文件。“活的文件”的意思不是说宪法会四处走动打招呼，或者偷吃你室友山姆·亚当斯啤酒冰箱里的东西。宪法被称为活的文件，因为它可以通过修正案进行修改。尽管在 200 多年的时间里，只通过了 27 条修正案。记住，即使是权利法案也是在 1787 年制宪会议之后才加入的。

权利法案的目的是确保和保护宪法中没有明确规定的权利。例如，尽管宪法建立了一个更强大的国家政府，但第十修正案规定：“本宪法未授予合众国、也未禁止各州行使的权力，分别由各州或人民保留之。”

为了让你了解宪法的动态性，以下内容不在原始文件中：总统任期两届的限制、参议员的直接选举、奴隶制违宪。一些历史学家认为宪法不是一部民主的文件。在宪法中，对民主进程有各种各样的制约。选举人团的设立是为了保护总统选举不受民众一时兴起的影响。在最初的宪法中，参议员实际上是由州议会而非选民选出的。在许多方面，最初设计的宪法旨在制约人民的普遍意愿。

幸运的是，宪法的修正案——至少有七条——将极大地解决美国社会各群体缺乏投票权的问题。可悲的是，一些群体要获得这项基本权利——投票权——还需要很长时间。

在我们的下一个视频中，我们将使这部宪法全面生效，并探讨“塑造新共和国”这个话题。下次再见，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
