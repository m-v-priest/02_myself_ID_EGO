What's up, beautiful people? Today we're taking a look at interactions 互动；相互作用 between American Indians and Europeans.

I've spent the last few videos talking about various European nations colonizing different parts of North America, but I hope you haven't forgotten that these various white people are rolling up on land that already has occupants 居住者. Interactions between Europeans and American Indian populations fostered 促进；培养 both conflict 冲突 and accommodation 迁就；适应.

Spanish, British, French and Dutch colonies sometimes allied with 与……结盟 and even armed American Indian groups. American Indian groups often sought alliances with Europeans against other American Indian groups. You all know the old saying: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." And these same European colonies sometimes also fought with various Native American tribes.

The British tended to have a much more antagonistic 敌对的；对立的 relationship with American Indian groups they encountered 遭遇；遇到. Remember, British colonists came in greater numbers than the French or Spanish and established permanent 永久的 settlements on American Indian land. This reality meant British colonists and American Indians fought over land, resources and political boundaries 边界.

Examples of this conflict can be seen in Metacom's War — or as the white man would say, King Philip's War (same dude). He was the chief of the Wampanoag Indian people. This showdown 摊牌；决战 would be in the New England region. In this event, tribes in the New England region formed alliances with one another led by Metacom to resist 抵抗；抵制 encroaching 不断侵蚀的 Puritan settlements and threats to American Indian sovereignty 主权. A bunch of colonists were killed, but ultimately this American Indian resistance would be defeated, thereby opening the New England colonies to further settlement opportunities and removing from the colony any future serious threats to expansion from American Indians.

Events such as Bacon's Rebellion were not only indicative of 表明；显示 tension between colonial settlers on the frontier and the elite colonial leaders, but also conflict on the frontier between Native Americans versus former indentured servants and formerly enslaved people over land. There is a desire for land in the expanding Virginia colony, especially amongst former indentured servants and formerly enslaved people.

It wasn't just in the British colonies in which Native Americans responded to European contact with violence and warfare. The Spanish will also catch American Indian resistance to their colonizing efforts in North America. As we've seen, the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 led to the death of a whole bunch of Spanish colonists. And since the Spanish did not come in as great of numbers as the English did in North America, when the Spanish returned to the Southwest region a little over a decade later, they were forced to accommodate some aspects of American Indian culture.

Also different than the British colonies, the Spaniards were much more willing to seek to convert 使改变（宗教或信仰）；使皈依 local indigenous 土著的；本土的 people to Catholicism and integrate 使融入 into the Spanish colonial society.

In the French and Dutch colonial settlements, both European powers set up trading forts 堡垒；要塞 to foster 促进；培养 commerce 贸易 between local tribes and local colonial settlements. Most often it was the fur trade that was the main economic activity. But generally speaking, both the French and Dutch colonies coexisted with much less violence than the British colonies and the various tribes they came into contact with.

In many cases, the French colonists formed alliances with tribes such as the Huron and Ottawa people, and these alliances served a purpose beyond just basic economics. The French arrived in far fewer numbers than the British, thus they relied on local indigenous people for protection from not only rival tribes but also rival European powers. These alliances between the French and American Indian groups not only made them dollars, but it also made good sense.

Another aspect of colonization of New France also included Jesuit missionaries 传教士, so like the Spanish but on a much smaller scale, New France also sought to convert some native people.

Despite the wide variety of ways that native people sought to respond to European colonial settlements, none of the European colonies treated Native American people as a sovereign 拥有主权的 people worthy of equal treatment to their European neighbors.

And in our next video, I will examine 考察；调查 slavery 奴隶制；奴役 in the British colonies. Until next time, thank you so much for watching this Joe's Productions video. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我们来探讨美洲印第安人和欧洲人之间的互动。

在过去的几个视频中，我一直在谈论各个欧洲国家在北美不同地区的殖民活动，但我希望你们没有忘记，这些不同的白人正在侵占已经有人居住的土地。欧洲人和美洲印第安人之间的互动既有冲突也有适应。

西班牙、英国、法国和荷兰殖民地有时会与美洲印第安人群体结盟甚至武装他们。美洲印第安人群体经常寻求与欧洲人结盟以对抗其他美洲印第安人群体。你们都知道那句老话：“敌人的敌人就是我的朋友。”而这些欧洲殖民地有时也会与不同的美洲原住民部落发生冲突。

英国人往往与他们遇到的美洲印第安人群体有着更加敌对的关系。记住，英国殖民者的人数比法国或西班牙人多，并且在美洲印第安人的土地上建立了永久定居点。这一现实意味着英国殖民者和美洲印第安人为了土地、资源和政治边界而战。

这种冲突的例子可以在梅塔科姆战争中看到——或者白人会称之为菲利普国王战争（同一个人）。他是万帕诺亚格印第安人的首领。这场对决将发生在新英格兰地区。在这次事件中，新英格兰地区的部落在梅塔科姆的领导下彼此结盟，以抵抗不断逼近的清教徒定居点和对美洲印第安人主权的威胁。许多殖民者被杀，但最终这场美洲印第安人的抵抗将被击败，从而为新英格兰殖民地进一步的定居机会打开了大门，并消除了该殖民地未来来自美洲印第安人扩张的任何严重威胁。

像培根叛乱这样的事件不仅表明边境殖民定居者与精英殖民领导人之间的紧张关系，也表明边境地区美洲原住民与前契约仆人和前被奴役人民之间因土地而发生的冲突。在不断扩张的弗吉尼亚殖民地，尤其是在前契约仆人和前被奴役人民中，存在着对土地的渴望。

不仅仅是在英国殖民地，美洲原住民以暴力和战争回应欧洲人的接触。西班牙人也会在北美洲遇到美洲印第安人对其殖民努力的抵抗。正如我们所见，1680 年的普韦布罗起义导致了大量西班牙殖民者的死亡。由于西班牙人在北美洲的人数不如英国人多，当西班牙人在十多年后返回西南部地区时，他们被迫接受美洲印第安文化的一些方面。

与英国殖民地也不同的是，西班牙人更愿意寻求使当地土著居民皈依天主教，并将他们融入西班牙殖民社会。

在法国和荷兰的殖民定居点，这两个欧洲强国都建立了贸易堡垒，以促进当地部落和当地殖民定居点之间的商业往来。最常见的是毛皮贸易是主要的经济活动。但总的来说，与英国殖民地及其接触的各个部落相比，法国和荷兰殖民地在暴力冲突方面要少得多。

在许多情况下，法国殖民者与休伦人和渥太华人等部落结成了联盟，这些联盟的目的不仅仅是基本的经济利益。法国人的人数远少于英国人，因此他们依靠当地土著居民来保护自己，不仅免受敌对部落的侵害，也免受敌对欧洲强权的侵害。法国人和美洲印第安人群体之间的这些联盟不仅为他们带来了财富，而且也很有意义。

新法兰西殖民的另一个方面还包括耶稣会传教士，所以像西班牙人一样，但规模要小得多，新法兰西也试图使一些当地居民皈依。

尽管当地居民试图以各种方式回应欧洲殖民定居点，但没有一个欧洲殖民地将美洲原住民视为拥有主权、值得与欧洲邻居平等对待的人民。

在我们的下一个视频中，我将探讨英国殖民地的奴隶制。下次再见，非常感谢您观看乔氏制作的视频。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
