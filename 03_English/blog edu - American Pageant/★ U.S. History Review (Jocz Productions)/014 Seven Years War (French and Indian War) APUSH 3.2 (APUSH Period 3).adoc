What's up, beautiful people? Today we are covering the Seven Years' War in North America -- known as the French and Indian War. Let's get into the background.

In the mid-18th century, colonial rivalry 竞争； rivalry intensified 加剧 between Britain (in the yellow) and France (in the red/purplish color). What are they beefing over? The population of the British colonies expanded into the interior 内陆；腹地 of North America and came into contact with areas claimed by France. Remember, although this area is claimed by France, the population of New France was substantially 非常；大大地 smaller than the British 13 colonies.

Since the French had way less people in North America and tended to coexist with 与……共存 Native American tribes -- there was the fur trade, some intermarriage 通婚 -- the British colonists' entry into the interior of North America threatened not only French claims to this region but also threatened French-Indian trade networks and American Indian autonomy 自治；自主权.

The French and Indian War would not be the first war between these European powers. Three other wars would also take place. All of these wars demonstrate that European imperial 帝国的 powers fought one another for dominance 统治；控制 in North America. Ultimately, the French and Indian War would break out when a Virginian named George Washington was sent with the Virginia militia 民兵组织 to warn the French to stay the heck away from British land claims. Shots were fired, and we got ourselves a war that was started in North America.

The French and Indian War would start in North America over this conflict in the Ohio Valley -- a competition between Britain and France over colonial territory 领土 in North America. In 1756, the war would become a global conflict called the Seven Years' War. Cheers to one of the first world wars.

In terms of who is fighting: on one side you have the French and a lot of important alliances 联盟 with various Indian groups. It makes sense -- the majority of Native American tribes in the region would side with 支持 the French. There are far fewer of them, they had established trade networks with the French settlements, and Britain was seen as the far greater threat. On the other side were the British, who also had some alliances with local tribes but nowhere near what France had, and of course her 13 colonies.

Early on, the colonists and their mama country Britain struggled against the French and their Native American allies. The immediate challenge was to figure out how the colonies and mama would defend the colonies against the French. To accomplish this goal, a meeting was held called the Albany Congress in 1754.

At the Albany Congress, the founding father Benjamin Franklin proposed his Albany Plan of Union. This is the context for Mr. Benny Franklin creating the political cartoon "Join or Die." The basic premise 前提；假定 of the plan was for the colonies to cooperate by choosing representatives that would meet to coordinate 协调 colonial defense and western expansion -- or to put simply, "join or die." They also invited members of the Iroquois Confederacy to try to convince them to join team mama England against the French and their Indian allies.

Nothing unfortunately really came of the Albany Plan. Remember, these colonies have no real shared history with one another -- they don't see themselves as having a common goal. However, the Albany Plan would establish a precedent 先例 for the colonies coordinating with one another that would actually come into existence with the Stamp Act Congress, Continental Congress, and other events we will talk about in the near future.

While at first the French were winning the French and Indian War, unfortunately for them that didn't last too long. Eventually the war would end in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris. France was kicked out of North America -- they lost all their colonial territory in North America. A place they will keep in the Western Hemisphere is Haiti, which will be important when we get to the Louisiana Purchase (foreshadowing 预示；伏笔).

With the defeat of the French, Britain got a ton of new territory. All that land they were originally beefing over in the Ohio River Valley was granted to Britain. Also granted was Canada, and they also got Florida from Spain. French lands west of the Mississippi were handed over to Spain.

Now that the land in the Ohio River Valley was free of French control, colonists sought to expand westward into this territory. They figured the Ohio River Valley is open for settlement. There are some challenges for Britain though. England has to maintain control over this large chunk of territory they just won. They suddenly have to deal with the French colonists who are in Canada that they just acquired, and they also have to deal with conflicts between the colonists and American Indians in the frontier 边疆；边境.

France's loss in the French and Indian War was not only bad for France but also for various American Indian tribes. They not only lost their main trading partner, but their claims to the land were not at all recognized by the Treaty of Paris. Problems are going to emerge really quickly.

Pontiac, an Ottawa chief, forged 建立；缔造 a western confederation 联盟 and rebelled against 反抗 colonists encroaching on 侵蚀；侵占 Native American land in 1763. Pontiac's Rebellion ultimately led to the death of a bunch of colonists, and of course the colonists are looking at mama: "Help me!" In response, Britain not only had to keep additional troops in North America -- not only to crush 镇压 Pontiac's Rebellion but also to govern their vast 广阔的 new territorial holdings acquired from the French and Indian War.

To help accomplish this goal, Parliament passed the Proclamation Line of 1763. This act forbid 禁止 colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. The hope was this would prevent conflict between colonists and American Indians on the frontier. And it makes sense -- if colonists can't go west of the Appalachian Mountains into Native American land, the likelihood 可能性 of them being killed by American Indians dramatically goes down, and Britain won't be asked to defend the colonists.

But the Proclamation Act of 1763 was one part of growing colonial resentment 愤恨；不满 towards Britain. Another impact of the French and Indian War was a tremendous 巨大的 increase in Britain's debt. Not only was the war pricey, but look at all that territory Britain has to protect and govern. War is expensive, and the British saw the war as part of the defense of the colonies. Therefore, in the minds of Britain, the colonies should help pay down the debt and the added cost of administering 管理；治理 a much bigger empire in North America. This is where the taxes are going to come in.

But remember, for most of the time period, the colonies were allowed a great degree of freedom. This was called salutary neglect 有益的忽视（指18世纪英国对其殖民地采取的宽松政策）. After 1763, this period of salutary neglect will come to an end as, in response to the new realities, Britain will seek to raise revenue 收入 through taxes and consolidate 巩固 control over the colonies. New taxes and increased regulation was another part of growing colonial resentment towards Britain.

Colonists see things very differently. They felt they fought in the French and Indian War and should be able to reap the rewards of that war. In their minds, the land is ours. So in the end, the French and Indian War had enormous consequences 后果；影响 for the relationship between mama Britain and her 13 kiddos. The biggest effect of the French and Indian War though will be a dramatic change in British colonial policy.

And in our next video, I will examine "taxation without representation." Until next time, thank you so much for watching this Joe's Productions video. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！在这一系列视频中，我将介绍一些我希望在高中学到的东西。在这一集中，我提出了这个问题：你会吃另一个人吗？詹姆斯敦的故事。

关于詹姆斯敦有很多有趣的事情值得了解。它是美洲最古老的永久性英国殖民地。约翰·史密斯在殖民地建立了军事纪律，并在迪士尼的改编中经历了彻底的形象改造——宝嘉康蒂也是如此——最终，经济作物烟草将成为拯救该殖民地免于失败的资源。但詹姆斯敦的殖民者面临着非常艰难的条件。

我们的故事始于 1606 年 12 月下旬，104 名男性殖民者乘坐三艘船起航。你没听错——第一批殖民者全是男人。他们于 1607 年 4 月抵达切萨皮克湾，并于 1607 年 5 月 13 日登陆一个狭窄的半岛（实际上是一个岛屿），沿詹姆斯河建立了詹姆斯敦殖民地。当地的美洲印第安人称之为波瓦坦河，但殖民者以詹姆斯国王的名字命名这条河，詹姆斯国王向弗吉尼亚公司授予特许状，以在北美建立定居点。有趣的事实：这是詹姆斯小时候的画像。这里有很多东西需要解读。

他们总共花了四个月的时间才跨越大西洋，但艰难的时期才刚刚开始。在最初的 104 名定居者中，只有 38 人在詹姆斯敦度过了最初的九个月。导致第一批人死亡的原因是饥饿（到达的定居者不习惯从事艰苦的农业劳动——他们希望像西班牙在他们的殖民地那样找到黄金或白银——但这并没有发生）。他们到达的时间对这些殖民者来说也很糟糕——该地区正经历几个世纪以来最严重的干旱之一，而痢疾、伤寒以及我最喜欢说的坏血病等疾病正在一个接一个地夺走他们的生命。

现在我承认当农民很辛苦。我曾经尝试种食物，新冠疫情爆发了，我只收获了两根形状和大小都很奇怪的黄瓜。而詹姆斯敦的人们则发现事情的艰难程度完全是另一个层次的。唯一让剩下的 38 人活下来的就是与当地美洲原住民的贸易。由于约翰·史密斯船长在 1608 年初与当地部落达成了停战协议，这种贸易持续了很短的时间。该部落向殖民者提供了让他们活命的黏玉米。

然而到了 1609 年，情况变得越来越糟。干旱仍在持续。殖民者与当地的波瓦坦联盟发生了冲突。当定居者开始强行夺取食物时，他们激怒了当地部落。作为回应，波瓦坦人袭击了殖民地。周围都是敌人，殖民者无法离开他们的堡垒——因此他们无法去取淡水、狩猎或捕鱼。显然他们不受欢迎了。而且很可能殖民者饮用的水盐度极高。

这段时期被称为“饥饿时期”，殖民者在生存方面面临着艰难的选择。我们通过对该遗址的挖掘以及原始资料了解到，殖民者吃了狗、猫和马。我们还通过阅读詹姆斯敦一位领导人的原始资料了解到，他们还吃了老鼠、皮革靴子。真好吃。而我们现在知道，殖民者甚至开始同类相食。

多年来，人类学家团队一直在研究詹姆斯敦遗址，2012 年，他们发现了一个女孩的遗骸，经检查显示出许多迹象表明这个人曾被其他人吃掉。他们将骨头带到实验室进行了各种科学研究——是的，科学。结果，该团队创建了一个 3D 面部重建模型，根据检查的数据，确定骨骼遗骸属于一名大约 14 岁的女性。这个年龄的估计是基于她的臼齿的大小。下巴、脸部和前额上的切痕被确定为同类相食的迹象。专家得出结论，这些切口的目的是取出大脑供人食用。大脑很可能最先被吃掉，因为它死后腐烂得非常快。

我们不知道是谁请她“吃晚餐”——我的意思是吃了她当晚餐——但我们确实知道，在第一个永久性美国殖民地的建立过程中确实发生了同类相食。听着，我热爱食物——我中学时的绰号是“甜甜圈男孩”——但我想知道：在任何情况下，同类相食都是错误的吗？出于好奇，如果你陷入生死攸关的境地，你会吃另一个人吗？虽然没有证据表明詹姆斯敦的同类相食与谋杀有关，但你会为了生存而杀死另一个人并吃掉他吗？如果会，你会吃哪个部位，又会怎么烹饪呢？

就到这里了。请在评论中回答我的问题，看看和你一起观看这个视频的都是些什么怪人。非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
