What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're taking a look at a very important topic: the Alien and Sedition Acts 客籍法和煽动叛乱法 and Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions 肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议.

You might recall after the XYZ Affair XYZ 事件，many Americans felt disrespected by France. Following that diplomatic 外交的 embarrassment, an undeclared naval war between the US and France took place called the Quasi-War 准战争. Much of the administration of John Adams was consumed with trying to keep the US neutral 中立的 as France was fighting most of Europe.

In response to this challenge, the Federalist-controlled Congress passed a couple of laws. The Alien Act 客籍法 allowed for the deportation 驱逐 or arrest of immigrants considered dangerous. This was intended to target citizens of nations hostile 敌对的 to the United States. The Sedition Act 煽动叛乱法 was also passed. This made it illegal to criticize the government of the United States.

The Federalists argued that these laws were necessary for strengthening national security during the Quasi-War. Critics argued that the real purpose of these acts was to suppress 镇压 dissent 异议 of those criticizing President Adams' foreign policy towards England and France -- especially the Democratic-Republicans 民主共和党人. They also argued the Sedition Act violated the First Amendment freedom of speech 言论自由 to the US Constitution.

Needless to say, the Alien and Sedition Acts provoked 激起 widespread anger and would call into question the power of the federal and state governments. This issue also raised questions as to what is the proper balance between liberty 自由 and security, or the balance between liberty and order in the nation.

Supporters of the Alien and Sedition Acts argued that because our security was threatened -- due to it being a time of war (well, at least a Quasi-War) -- that it was necessary to reduce the liberties of people to protect the country as a whole. Not everyone was buying this argument though.

In response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were written. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions sought to oppose federal laws that Democratic-Republicans felt were unconstitutional 违宪的. The Kentucky Resolution, written by Thomas Jefferson, and the Virginia Resolution, written by James Madison, said a state could nullify 废除 federal laws passed by Congress the states felt were unconstitutional.

The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions argued that the state governments had the power to decide whether or not an act of Congress was constitutional. Now this power is stated nowhere in the Constitution, but the 10th Amendment does state that the powers not delegated to the federal government, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved 保留 to the states or the people.

Remember, Jefferson and Madison are members of the Democratic-Republicans who were advocates 倡导者 for state rights. The idea behind nullification was this: the Alien and Sedition Acts were federal laws passed by Congress. Since in the minds of many Americans the Sedition Act violated the First Amendment to the Constitution, states such as Kentucky and Virginia could choose to nullify -- cancel, ignore, or just not obey -- that federal law the states felt was unconstitutional. Since these states felt the federal government exceeded 超越 its delegated powers, the states were not bound to follow the act of the federal government.

Now this whole situation will calm down by 1800, since the Democratic-Republican Party will take control of Congress, and as a result, Federalists will not be able to get their agenda passed. And in 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party will win the presidency for the first time with the election of Thomas Jefferson. And following that election, the Sedition Act was allowed to expire 期满失效.

Now it is very important you know that in just a couple of years after this mini-crisis, the Supreme Court case of Marbury versus Madison 马伯里诉麦迪逊案 in 1803 will state that the Supreme Court had the power to determine an act of the federal government to be unconstitutional. This is known as the power of judicial review 司法审查.

However, these disputes between the federal and state governments would not end. South Carolina will attempt to nullify the so-called Tariff of Abominations 可憎关税法 passed by the federal government. Northern states will attempt to ignore the tougher Fugitive Slave Act 逃奴法 in the 1850s. And quite famously, a bunch of southern states will attempt to leave the union after the election of Lincoln in 1860. Foreshadowing 预示. But we'll save those for another time.

Until then, learn why your money is racist or see the evidence that proves Dwight Schrute from The Office was really a Nazi. Links to both videos in the description. Until next time, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们来探讨一个非常重要的话题：《外国人与煽动叛乱法》以及肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议。

你可能还记得，在 XYZ 事件之后，许多美国人感到受到了法国的轻视。在那次外交上的尴尬之后，美国和法国之间爆发了一场未宣战的海战，史称准战争。约翰·亚当斯总统的大部分执政时期都耗费在努力维持美国在中法战争中的中立地位上。

为了应对这一挑战，联邦党控制的国会通过了几项法律。《外国人法》允许驱逐或逮捕被认为危险的移民。其目的是针对与美国敌对国家的公民。《煽动叛乱法》也获得通过。该法案规定，批评美国政府是非法的。

联邦党人认为，这些法律对于在准战争期间加强国家安全是必要的。批评者认为，这些法案的真正目的是压制那些批评亚当斯总统对英国和法国外交政策的人——特别是民主共和党人——的异议。他们还认为，《煽动叛乱法》侵犯了美国宪法第一修正案赋予的言论自由权。

毋庸置疑，《外国人与煽动叛乱法》激起了广泛的愤怒，并将联邦和州政府的权力置于质疑之下。这个问题还引发了关于国家自由与安全之间、或自由与秩序之间适当平衡的疑问。

《外国人与煽动叛乱法》的支持者认为，由于我们的安全受到威胁——正值战争时期（好吧，至少是准战争时期）——因此有必要限制人民的自由以保护整个国家。然而，并非所有人都接受这种论点。

为了回应《外国人与煽动叛乱法》，肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议得以撰写。肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议旨在反对民主共和党人认为违宪的联邦法律。托马斯·杰斐逊撰写的肯塔基决议和詹姆斯·麦迪逊撰写的弗吉尼亚决议声明，如果各州认为国会通过的联邦法律违宪，各州可以宣布这些法律无效。

肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议认为，州政府有权决定国会法案是否符合宪法。这项权力在宪法的任何地方都没有明确规定，但第十修正案确实声明，宪法未授予联邦政府、也未禁止各州行使的权力，分别由各州或人民保留之。

记住，杰斐逊和麦迪逊都是民主共和党人，他们是州权的倡导者。无效化背后的想法是：外国人与煽动叛乱法是国会通过的联邦法律。由于在许多美国人看来，《煽动叛乱法》侵犯了宪法第一修正案，肯塔基州和弗吉尼亚州等州可以选择宣布——取消、忽略或只是不遵守——这些州认为违宪的联邦法律无效。由于这些州认为联邦政府超出了其被授予的权力，因此各州不受联邦政府法案的约束。

到 1800 年，整个局势将会平静下来，因为民主共和党将控制国会，结果，联邦党将无法通过他们的议程。1800 年，民主共和党将首次赢得总统职位，托马斯·杰斐逊当选总统。在那次选举之后，《煽动叛乱法》被允许失效。

现在非常重要的是你要知道，就在这场小危机发生几年后的 1803 年，马伯里诉麦迪逊案的最高法院判决将声明最高法院有权裁定联邦政府的法案违宪。这被称为司法审查权。

然而，联邦政府和州政府之间的这些争端并没有结束。南卡罗来纳州将试图废除联邦政府通过的所谓的“可憎关税”。北方各州将在 1850 年代试图无视更严厉的《逃亡奴隶法》。最为著名的是，在 1860 年林肯当选总统后，一群南方州将试图脱离联邦。伏笔。但我们将在以后的视频中讨论这些。

在那之前，了解为什么你的钱是种族主义的，或者查看证明《办公室》里的德怀特·施鲁特实际上是纳粹的证据。两个视频的链接都在描述中。下次再见，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
