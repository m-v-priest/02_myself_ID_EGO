What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. In this video, we're taking a look at the American System and Henry Clay.

Following the War of 1812, there was an outpouring of nationalism 民族主义 in the young nation. The U.S. had once again defended 捍卫；保卫 its independence 独立 from Great Britain. "We're going to survive! Today we celebrate celebrate 庆祝；祝贺 our Independence Day!" And as a result, the country was united 团结的；联合的 more so than ever before.

In addition 此外；而且, prior to 在…之前, during 在…期间, and after 在…之后 the War of 1812, the U.S. was starting to experience 经历；体验 something known as the Market Revolution 市场革命. During the Market Revolution, innovations 创新；革新 in textile 纺织的 machinery 机器；设备 increased 增加；提高 the efficiency 效率 of production 生产 methods 方法；方式. All of the embargoes 禁运令 that took place 发生；举行 prior to 在…之前 the War of 1812 to try to maintain 维持；保持 American neutrality 中立 meant American manufacturing 制造业 was beginning to develop 发展；形成. It had to develop or there would be no manufactured goods 制成品；工业品 in America.

You can see in this graphic 图表的；形象的 that by 1840, most of the textile industry 纺织工业 was largely 主要地；在很大程度上 concentrated 集中；聚集 in the northeastern 东北部的 part of the United States. While the South grew cotton 棉花, they did not process 加工；处理 it. It was largely 主要地 northern 北方的 factories 工厂 that spun 纺(纱) and wove 织(布) raw cotton 原棉 into cloth 布 if it wasn't being sent to Britain.

And after the War of 1812, Henry Clay came up with 想出；提出 a plan to unify 统一；使联合 the U.S. economy 经济 called the American System. The American System was Henry Clay's proposal 提议；建议 for renewal 更新；恢复 of the national bank 国家银行, a protective tariff 保护性关税, and internal 内部的 transportation 运输；交通 improvements 改进；改善. Tariffs 关税 would largely 主要地 help the Northeast by protecting American manufacturing. The national bank would aid 帮助；援助 the economies 经济体系；经济状况 of all parts of the country. And internal transportation improvements would primarily 主要地 help the growth 增长；发展 of the West and South, but would benefit 使受益；对…有益 all parts of the country as well. Henry Clay felt the American System would be a huge boost 促进；提高 to the entire 整个的 U.S. economy.

Let me get into some of the details 细节. The charter 特许状；执照 of the Bank of the United States was allowed to expire 到期；终止 in 1811. Following 在…之后 the war, many Democratic-Republicans began to rethink 重新考虑 their opposition 反对；对抗 to a national bank -- because I want to make bank, bro. They came to understand 理解；明白 that a strong banking system would help the economy prosper 繁荣；兴旺 and ensure 确保；保证 access to 接近；进入 easy and abundant 丰富的；充足的 credit 信贷. And as a result, Congress 国会 renewed 更新；恢复 the Bank of the United States in 1816.

While the bank was generally 一般地；普遍地 accepted 接受；认可 by many Democratic-Republicans, not everyone was as enthusiastic 热情的；热烈的 about the Tariff of 1816. The Tariff of 1816 was the first time a tariff was passed primarily 主要地 for protection 保护, not just to raise revenue 收入；税收. The purpose 目的；意图 of the tariff was to help out 帮助 American factories. While this sounds super awesome, areas without a large number of factories did not see the benefit 益处；好处 of this tariff. Some saw the Tariff of 1816 as sectional 地区性的；部门的 legislation 立法；法规.

There was a concern 担忧；忧虑 that some of the policies 政策；方针 of the American System would benefit 使受益；对…有益 industry 工业 over agriculture 农业. People outside the North felt like the tariff is going to hurt 伤害；损害 them. Here is how: Let's just say the cost rate factoring into 考虑…因素；把…计算在内 a manufacturing 制造业的 t-shirt was 20 cents. Because American industries -- it's early stages 早期阶段 of development 发展 -- it cost an American factory three dollars to manufacture 制造；生产 the same type of product 产品. Assuming 假设；假定 the items have similar 相似的 quality 质量, consumers 消费者 in the U.S. are clearly 显然地；清楚地 going to favor 偏爱；倾向于 the British item because it's cheaper. But the Tariff of 1816 was intended to do was to help protect American manufacturing from this type of competition 竞争；对抗. Tariffs made imports 进口商品 more expensive as they put taxes 税 on imported goods.

So for instance 例如；比如, let's just say the U.S. decides to charge 收费；要价 a tax of one dollar per imported good. The British-made t-shirt now would cost $1.20 in the United States. I know you are super impressed by my sick math skills. The idea behind 在…背后；…的原因 the tariff was to encourage 鼓励；激励 consumers to buy American goods since the tariff made foreign 外国的；国外的 goods more expensive. As you can see with this tariff example, the American t-shirt is the better deal.

Now Clay believed a protective tariff would be key to 关键的；至关重要的 developing American manufacturing and industry. By protecting industry from British competition, Clay felt the U.S. should increase domestic 国内的；本国的 manufacturing in order to 为了；以便 promote 促进；推动 economic 经济的 prosperity 繁荣；兴旺. However 然而；但是, people outside the industrializing 工业化的 North are not too fond of 喜爱；喜欢 this plan. They just want the cheapest product available 可获得的；可得到的. The Tariff of 1816 made manufactured goods more expensive.

Now Henry Clay would not have a book calling him The Essential American if he did not have a plan to get support 支持；拥护 for the American System. In order to 为了；以便 get members 成员 of Congress 国会 on the South and West to support the tariff, he proposed 提议；建议 money from the tariff would be used to fund 资助；为…提供资金 internal improvements to transportation -- especially 特别是；尤其 roads and canals 运河.

Transportation improvements generated 产生；引起 a lot of enthusiasm 热情；热忱. As you can see, it took a heck of a lot of time to get to places in the early 19th century. This had repercussions 影响；后果 not only for trade 贸易；商业 but also national defense 国防. The idea behind 在…背后；…的原因 transportation improvements was goods from the North and East would be manufactured goods heading to 前往；驶向 markets 市场 in the South and West. Food and raw materials 原材料 such as 例如；比如 cotton 棉花 would travel from the South and West to the North and East. And these internal improvements would increase trade amongst 在…之中；在…之间 the different sections 部分；区域 of the country. Clay and others felt this movement 运动；流动 of goods would unite 联合；团结 the country economically 经济上 and politically 政治上 by developing a national economy.

While this sounds super wonderful, as we've seen with the tariff, the American System will generate 产生；引起 a debate 辩论；争论 in the country. So who's debating? With the demise 灭亡；衰落 of the Federalists, there was only one political party -- the Democratic-Republicans. The Federalist Party put another nail in their political coffin 给…的政治生涯敲响丧钟 by largely 主要地 opposing 反对；对抗 the War of 1812. And some radical 激进的 Federalists really messed up 搞砸；弄糟 when during the war they participated in 参与；参加 the Hartford Convention and discussed 讨论；商议 possibly 可能地；也许 leaving the union 联邦 over their objections 反对；异议 to the War of 1812 and Democratic-Republican policies 政策；方针.

Following 在…之后 the election 选举 of 1816, the Federalists are going to be pretty much 几乎；差不多 gone from national politics. Federalists got beat down 在…中惨败 in the election of 1816 and did not even nominate 提名 a presidential candidate 总统候选人 for the election of 1820. And although 虽然；尽管 this period 时期；阶段 of only one political party and increased nationalism will be called the Era of Good Feelings, not everything is going to be all peachy 一帆风顺的；美好的.

Just because there's only one political party, with only one national political party remaining 剩余的；剩下的, the Democratic-Republican Party suffered 遭受；经历 internal 内部的 debate 辩论；争论 and tension 紧张；张力. Some members 成员 of the party stuck to 坚持；忠于 the old party ideals 理想；观念 of limited 有限的 federal government and a strict 严格的；严厉的 interpretation 解释；理解 of the Constitution. As I've discussed 讨论；论述, many of the Democratic-Republicans in the South opposed 反对；对抗 the tariff which they felt favored 偏爱；有利于 industry 工业 and the northern 北方的 sections 部分；区域 of the country.

Now keep in mind 记住；牢记 Henry Clay at this time is also a Democratic-Republican. The whole vibe 氛围；气氛 of this party was state rights and emphasis 强调；重视 on agriculture 农业. But Clay and others in the party began to accept 接受；认可 some of the Federalist ideas such as support 支持；拥护 for the national bank and trying to develop domestic 国内的；本国的 manufacturing.

But other Democratic-Republicans such as President James Madison felt the Constitution did not give the federal government the power to get involved in 参与；涉及 transportation improvements within 在…之内；在…内部 the states. In 1817, President Madison vetoed 否决 the Bonus Bill that would have used federal funds 联邦基金 to build roads, bridges 桥梁 and canals 运河 throughout 遍及；贯穿 the country. President Monroe also resisted 抵制；反对 federal funding 联邦拨款 on roads and canal construction 建设；建造. Both Madison and Monroe maintained 坚持；认为 the Constitution did not explicitly 明确地；清晰地 allow for 允许；准许 federal spending 联邦支出 on roads and canals, and opposed 反对；抵制 federal funding for transportation improvements.

As a result, during the Transportation Revolution, it would be the states that would take on 承担；负责 most of the transportation projects 项目；工程. The most famous project being the Erie Canal, completed 完成于 in 1825. As you can see, the improvements in transportation such as 例如；比如 the steamboat 汽船 and the building of roads, canals, and eventually 最终；终于 railroads 铁路 dramatically 显著地；急剧地 changed the amount of time it took to travel and the cost to transport 运输；运送 goods and people.

But in spite of 尽管；虽然 the nationalism during this time period 时期；阶段 and the existence 存在；生存 of only one political party, there still were debates about the American System and the role 作用；角色 of the federal government, what is allowed under 根据；按照 the Constitution, and a whole variety of 各种各样的 other issues 问题；议题.

In our next video, we're going to take a look at 审视；考察 Jackson and federal power. But until next time, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国体系和亨利·克莱。

1812 年战争结束后，年轻的美国民族主义情绪高涨。美国再次捍卫了其免受英国统治的独立。“我们将生存下去！今天我们庆祝我们的独立日！”结果，这个国家比以往任何时候都更加团结。

此外，在 1812 年战争之前、期间和之后，美国开始经历一场被称为市场革命的变革。在市场革命期间，纺织机械的创新提高了生产方法的效率。1812 年战争之前为维持美国中立而采取的所有禁运措施意味着美国制造业开始发展。它必须发展，否则美国将没有制成品。

你可以在这张图表中看到，到 1840 年，大部分纺织工业主要集中在美国东北部。虽然南方种植棉花，但他们并不加工。如果棉花没有运往英国，主要是北方工厂将其纺织成布。

1812 年战争结束后，亨利·克莱提出了一个旨在统一美国经济的计划，称为美国体系。美国体系是亨利·克莱关于复兴国家银行、实行保护性关税和进行国内交通基础设施建设的提案。关税将在很大程度上通过保护美国制造业来帮助东北部。国家银行将帮助全国各地的经济。国内交通基础设施建设将主要帮助西部和南部的增长，但也将使全国各地受益。亨利·克莱认为美国体系将极大地促进整个美国经济的发展。

让我详细介绍一下。美国银行的特许状于 1811 年到期。战争结束后，许多民主共和党人开始重新考虑他们对国家银行的反对——因为我想发财，老兄。他们逐渐认识到，强大的银行体系将有助于经济繁荣并确保获得便捷且充足的信贷。结果，国会在 1816 年重新批准了美国银行。

虽然银行普遍被许多民主共和党人接受，但并非所有人都对 1816 年关税如此热衷。1816 年关税是首次主要为保护而非仅仅为增加收入而通过的关税。关税的目的是帮助美国工厂。虽然这听起来非常棒，但工厂数量不多的地区并没有看到这项关税的好处。一些人将 1816 年关税视为地区性立法。

人们担心美国体系的一些政策会优先考虑工业而不是农业。北部以外的人们觉得关税会损害他们的利益。原因是这样的：假设一件制造的 T 恤的成本核算为 20 美分。由于美国工业尚处于发展初期，美国工厂生产同样类型的产品需要 3 美元。假设这些产品的质量相似，美国消费者显然会更喜欢英国产品，因为它更便宜。但 1816 年关税的目的是帮助保护美国制造业免受这种竞争。关税通过对进口商品征税，使进口商品更加昂贵。

例如，假设美国决定对每件进口商品征收 1 美元的税。英国制造的 T 恤在美国现在将花费 1.20 美元。我知道你对我的高超数学技能印象深刻。关税背后的想法是鼓励消费者购买美国商品，因为关税使外国商品更加昂贵。正如你在这个关税示例中看到的，美国 T 恤更划算。

克莱认为，保护性关税是发展美国制造业和工业的关键。通过保护工业免受英国竞争，克莱认为美国应该增加国内制造业以促进经济繁荣。然而，工业化北部以外的人们并不太喜欢这个计划。他们只想要最便宜的产品。1816 年关税使制成品更加昂贵。

如果亨利·克莱没有一个争取美国体系支持的计划，就不会有一本书称他为“不可或缺的美国人”。为了争取南方和西部的国会议员支持关税，他提议将关税收入用于资助交通基础设施的国内改善——特别是道路和运河。

交通基础设施建设引起了极大的热情。正如你所看到的，在 19 世纪早期，到达某些地方需要花费大量时间。这不仅对贸易，而且对国防都有影响。交通基础设施建设背后的想法是，北部和东部的制成品将运往南部和西部的市场。食物和棉花等原材料将从南部和西部运往北部和东部。这些国内改善将增加该国不同地区之间的贸易。克莱和其他人认为，这种商品流通将通过发展国民经济在经济和政治上团结这个国家。

虽然这听起来非常美妙，但正如我们在关税问题上看到的那样，美国体系将在国内引发一场辩论。那么谁在辩论呢？随着联邦党的衰落，只剩下一个政党——民主共和党。联邦党通过在很大程度上反对 1812 年战争，为他们的政治棺材钉上了又一颗钉子。一些激进的联邦党人在战争期间参加了哈特福德会议，并讨论了可能因反对 1812 年战争和民主共和党政策而脱离联邦，这真的搞砸了。

1816 年大选之后，联邦党将几乎从国家政治中消失。联邦党在 1816 年大选中惨败，甚至没有提名 1820 年大选的总统候选人。虽然这段只有一个政党和民族主义情绪高涨的时期将被称为“美好时代”，但并非一切都那么顺利。

仅仅因为只有一个政党，随着唯一一个全国性政党——民主共和党——的保留，该党内部也遭受了内部分裂和紧张关系。该党的一些成员坚持旧的党派理想，即有限的联邦政府和对宪法的严格解释。正如我所讨论的那样，南方许多民主共和党人反对他们认为有利于工业和国家北部地区的关税。

现在请记住，当时的亨利·克莱也是一名民主共和党人。这个党的整体氛围是州权和强调农业。但克莱和党内的其他人开始接受一些联邦党的思想，例如支持国家银行和努力发展国内制造业。

但其他民主共和党人，如詹姆斯·麦迪逊总统，认为宪法并未赋予联邦政府干预各州境内交通基础设施建设的权力。1817 年，麦迪逊总统否决了“奖励法案”，该法案本可以将联邦资金用于在全国范围内修建道路、桥梁和运河。门罗总统也反对联邦政府资助道路和运河建设。麦迪逊和门罗都认为宪法没有明确允许联邦政府在道路和运河上支出，并反对联邦政府资助交通基础设施建设。

结果，在交通革命期间，各州承担了大部分交通基础设施建设项目。最著名的项目是 1825 年完工的伊利运河。正如你所看到的，汽船和道路、运河以及最终铁路建设等交通运输的改进极大地改变了旅行时间和运输货物和人员的成本。

但是，尽管当时民族主义情绪高涨，并且只有一个政党存在，但关于美国体系和联邦政府的角色、宪法允许的范围以及各种其他问题仍然存在争论。

在我们的下一个视频中，我们将探讨杰克逊和联邦权力。但在那之前，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！

What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. In this video, we're taking a look at the American System and Henry Clay.

Following the War of 1812, there was an outpouring of nationalism in the young nation. The U.S. had once again defended its independence from Great Britain. "We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!" And as a result, the country was united more so than ever before.

In addition, prior to, during, and after the War of 1812, the U.S. was starting to experience something known as the Market Revolution. During the Market Revolution, innovations in textile machinery increased the efficiency of production methods. All of the embargoes that took place prior to the War of 1812 to try to maintain American neutrality meant American manufacturing was beginning to develop. It had to develop or there would be no manufactured goods in America.

You can see in this graphic that by 1840, most of the textile industry was largely concentrated in the northeastern part of the United States. While the South grew cotton, they did not process it. It was largely northern factories that spun and wove raw cotton into cloth if it wasn't being sent to Britain.

And after the War of 1812, Henry Clay came up with a plan to unify the U.S. economy called the American System. The American System was Henry Clay's proposal for renewal of the national bank, a protective tariff, and internal transportation improvements. Tariffs would largely help the Northeast by protecting American manufacturing. The national bank would aid the economies of all parts of the country. And internal transportation improvements would primarily help the growth of the West and South, but would benefit all parts of the country as well. Henry Clay felt the American System would be a huge boost to the entire U.S. economy.

Let me get into some of the details. The charter of the Bank of the United States was allowed to expire in 1811. Following the war, many Democratic-Republicans began to rethink their opposition to a national bank -- because I want to make bank, bro. They came to understand that a strong banking system would help the economy prosper and ensure access to easy and abundant credit. And as a result, Congress renewed the Bank of the United States in 1816.

While the bank was generally accepted by many Democratic-Republicans, not everyone was as enthusiastic about the Tariff of 1816. The Tariff of 1816 was the first time a tariff was passed primarily for protection, not just to raise revenue. The purpose of the tariff was to help out American factories. While this sounds super awesome, areas without a large number of factories did not see the benefit of this tariff. Some saw the Tariff of 1816 as sectional legislation.

There was a concern that some of the policies of the American System would benefit industry over agriculture. People outside the North felt like the tariff is going to hurt them. Here is how: Let's just say the cost rate factoring into a manufacturing t-shirt was 20 cents. Because American industries -- it's early stages of development -- it cost an American factory three dollars to manufacture the same type of product. Assuming the items have similar quality, consumers in the U.S. are clearly going to favor the British item because it's cheaper. But the Tariff of 1816 was intended to do was to help protect American manufacturing from this type of competition. Tariffs made imports more expensive as they put taxes on imported goods.

So for instance, let's just say the U.S. decides to charge a tax of one dollar per imported good. The British-made t-shirt now would cost $1.20 in the United States. I know you are super impressed by my sick math skills. The idea behind the tariff was to encourage consumers to buy American goods since the tariff made foreign goods more expensive. As you can see with this tariff example, the American t-shirt is the better deal.

Now Clay believed a protective tariff would be key to developing American manufacturing and industry. By protecting industry from British competition, Clay felt the U.S. should increase domestic manufacturing in order to promote economic prosperity. However, people outside the industrializing North are not too fond of this plan. They just want the cheapest product available. The Tariff of 1816 made manufactured goods more expensive.

Now Henry Clay would not have a book calling him The Essential American if he did not have a plan to get support for the American System. In order to get members of Congress on the South and West to support the tariff, he proposed money from the tariff would be used to fund internal improvements to transportation -- especially roads and canals.

Transportation improvements generated a lot of enthusiasm. As you can see, it took a heck of a lot of time to get to places in the early 19th century. This had repercussions not only for trade but also national defense. The idea behind transportation improvements was goods from the North and East would be manufactured goods heading to markets in the South and West. Food and raw materials such as cotton would travel from the South and West to the North and East. And these internal improvements would increase trade amongst the different sections of the country. Clay and others felt this movement of goods would unite the country economically and politically by developing a national economy.

While this sounds super wonderful, as we've seen with the tariff, the American System will generate a debate in the country. So who's debating? With the demise of the Federalists, there was only one political party -- the Democratic-Republicans. The Federalist Party put another nail in their political coffin by largely opposing the War of 1812. And some radical Federalists really messed up when during the war they participated in the Hartford Convention and discussed possibly leaving the union over their objections to the War of 1812 and Democratic-Republican policies.

Following the election of 1816, the Federalists are going to be pretty much gone from national politics. Federalists got beat down in the election of 1816 and did not even nominate a presidential candidate for the election of 1820. And although this period of only one political party and increased nationalism will be called the Era of Good Feelings, not everything is going to be all peachy.

Just because there's only one political party, with only one national political party remaining, the Democratic-Republican Party suffered internal debate and tension. Some members of the party stuck to the old party ideals of limited federal government and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. As I've discussed, many of the Democratic-Republicans in the South opposed the tariff which they felt favored industry and the northern sections of the country.

Now keep in mind Henry Clay at this time is also a Democratic-Republican. The whole vibe of this party was state rights and emphasis on agriculture. But Clay and others in the party began to accept some of the Federalist ideas such as support for the national bank and trying to develop domestic manufacturing.

But other Democratic-Republicans such as President James Madison felt the Constitution did not give the federal government the power to get involved in transportation improvements within the states. In 1817, President Madison vetoed the Bonus Bill that would have used federal funds to build roads, bridges and canals throughout the country. President Monroe also resisted federal funding on roads and canal construction. Both Madison and Monroe maintained the Constitution did not explicitly allow for federal spending on roads and canals, and opposed federal funding for transportation improvements.

As a result, during the Transportation Revolution, it would be the states that would take on most of the transportation projects. The most famous project being the Erie Canal, completed in 1825. As you can see, the improvements in transportation such as the steamboat and the building of roads, canals, and eventually railroads dramatically changed the amount of time it took to travel and the cost to transport goods and people.

But in spite of the nationalism during this time period and the existence of only one political party, there still were debates about the American System and the role of the federal government, what is allowed under the Constitution, and a whole variety of other issues.

In our next video, we're going to take a look at Jackson and federal power. But until next time, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!
