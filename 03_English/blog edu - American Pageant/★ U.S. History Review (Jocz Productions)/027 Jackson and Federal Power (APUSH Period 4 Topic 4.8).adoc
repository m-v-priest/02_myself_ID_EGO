What's up 怎么了, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we are covering the presidency of Andrew Jackson 安德鲁·杰克逊总统任期.

In the early 19th century, there was an increase in white male suffrage 白人男性选举权. Property requirements 财产要求 were eliminated, thereby allowing most white men the right to vote. The election of Andrew Jackson in 1828 would come to symbolize this era of increased political participation 政治参与 of the Common Man 普通人. Unfortunately, when we say common man, we are only talking about white -- specifically white dudes.

Jackson was seen as the first so-called Common Man to become president, and he was a war hero 战争英雄. But Jackson's victory split the Democratic-Republicans and led to the formation of the Democratic and Whig party 辉格党. The Democrat Party was led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whigs were led by Henry Clay. During the second two-party system 两党制, the Democrats and Whigs disagreed about the role and powers of the federal government and issues such as the National Bank, tariffs 关税, and federally funded internal improvements 联邦资助的内部改进.

Let's get into some examples. The Tariff of 1828 sought to raise the tariff. The Tariff of 1828 made foreign goods more expensive, which would lead more people to buy goods manufactured in the United States. This would benefit Northern manufacturers 北方制造商. Southern States opposed the increased tariff, and since the tariff made imports more expensive, this hurt consumers in the U.S. who were not involved in manufacturing. Not to mention, the tariff led to the possibility that European countries would respond with their own tariff on Southern cotton.

In 1832, Congress passed another tariff that further increased sectional tensions 地区紧张局势. Southerners referred to the Tariff of 1828 as the Tariff of Abominations 可憎关税. In their mind, the tariff did nothing but favor the northern manufacturers. In 1828, Vice President John C. Calhoun secretly wrote the South Carolina Exposition and Protest 南卡罗来纳说明与抗议书 which outlined the idea of nullification 废止权. Nullification was the idea that a state could ignore an act or law of the federal government that they felt was unjust or unconstitutional. The result of the Tariff of 1828 was the Declaration of the Right of Nullification 废止权宣言.

The Nullification Crisis of 1832 1832年废止危机 was brought about over the issue of protective tariffs 保护性关税. In 1832, the state of South Carolina declared they would not enforce the tariff in the state of South Carolina. In addition, Calhoun argued that secession from the union 脱离联邦 was possible if state rights were being violated. Now to be clear, Andrew Jackson did not support nullification. Jackson did not feel a state had the right to nullify a federal law -- even a tariff which Jackson was not a supporter of. Jackson threatened to use federal force 联邦武力 to enforce federal law, and Jackson urged Congress to pass the Force Bill 武力法案 in 1833 that gave the president the power to use the military to enforce the collection of import duties 进口关税 if a state refused to comply with federal tariffs.

Both the Force Bill and Henry Clay's proposal for a lower tariff in 1833 helped end the Nullification Crisis. South Carolina ultimately backed down 让步. While the crisis was eventually solved with the threat of force and a compromise -- sometimes referred to as the olive branch and the sword 橄榄枝与剑 -- the Nullification Crisis once again revealed sectional tensions between the South and the North, illustrates a continued debate about the relationship between the states and federal government, and once again the Nullification Crisis serves as an example of another instance in which secession is threatened by a state when they disagreed with an action of the federal government.

Now Jackson would not be a defender of all things federal government. For those of you who are fans of irony 讽刺, although Jackson would eventually be placed on the $20 bill, he was not a fan of the National Bank 国家银行. Jackson opposed the Second Bank of the United States as he felt the bank favored the elite 精英 and the wealthy. Jackson also felt the National Bank was unconstitutional, even though the Supreme Court in McCulloch versus Maryland ruled the Bank of the United States to be constitutional.

In 1832, Congressman Henry Clay supported a bill renewing the charter 特许状 of the Second Bank of the United States. Jackson -- seen here looking like a 19th century pimp -- vetoed 否决 the bill seeking to renew the charter of the bank. This veto meant the National Bank of the U.S. would be gone in 4 years after its charter expired. Rather than wait for the Bank of the U.S.'s term to expire, Jackson wanted to take steps to destroy the Second Bank of the United States. In 1833, Jackson ordered all federal money to be withdrawn from the Second Bank of the United States, and the money was put into pet state banks 宠儿银行. They were known as pet banks due to their loyalty to the Jackson administration. As a result of all this, Jackson was able to kill the Second Bank of the United States. The end of the bank helped contribute to the Panic of 1837 1837年大恐慌, which was an economic collapse 经济崩溃 that led to widespread unemployment 普遍失业 and also this guy getting really drunk and dancing around this lady and kid on the floor.

The debate over the National Bank increased partisanship 党派之争 and division in the nation, and ultimately helped contribute to the rise of a second two-party system -- the Whigs and the Democrats. The Whigs were the folks opposed to Jackson. They felt Jackson was acting like a king with his repeated use of the veto, attack on the bank, and other uses of executive power 行政权力. The Whigs argued that Jackson treated the presidency as a monarchy 君主制. The Whigs tended to favor a strong central government 强大的中央政府 and generally supported Henry Clay's American System 美国体系.

On the other hand, Jackson did have a lot of support during this age of the Common Man. The Democrats under Jackson argued for a small national government and generally opposed the government's involvement in economic affairs 经济事务 and social issues 社会问题. Jackson's attack on the bank, his use of the spoils system 政党分赃制 which brought new people into the government, and even his use of the veto were seen by his supporters as proof that he was a defender and fought for the rights of the Common Man. But during his presidency, opposition to Jackson led to the formation of the Whig party and the return of the two-party system.

Without a doubt, the most controversial part of Jackson's presidency will be his treatment of American Indian people 美洲原住民. Throughout the early part of the 19th century, many American settlers supported efforts to expand the territory of the United States. The primary motive of this expansion was the desire to find new land to cultivate 开垦. As Americans moved west into the Southeast into places like Georgia, there were established American Indian tribes who claimed sovereignty 主权 over this land. These tribes were known as the Five Civilized Tribes 五大文明部落, and they claimed the land in the American Southeast that many Southerners hoped to acquire for cotton production.

Things heat up when gold is discovered in northern Georgia in 1828, and it was used as justification for the state of Georgia to attempt to take the land from the Cherokee people. The Cherokee Nation sued the state of Georgia to retain the rights to their land, and in the Supreme Court case of Worcester versus Georgia 伍斯特诉乔治亚州案, the Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was sovereign. What this meant was that Georgia had no right to enforce state laws in Cherokee territory -- the land was theirs. However, Jackson refused to enforce the Supreme Court decision of Worcester versus Georgia and completely ignored the ruling.

Just before the Supreme Court case, in 1830 Congress passed and Jackson signed into law the Indian Removal Act of 1830 印第安人迁移法案 which forced all American Indian tribes in this region to relocate west of the Mississippi River. The various tribes in the area will attempt different forms of resistance 抵抗. The Seminole Indians will fight a series of wars against the U.S. military, and as we've seen, the Cherokee will attempt to use the American legal system 美国法律体系 to protect their right to the land. While the Supreme Court did affirm American Indian rights to the land, ultimately under Andrew Jackson the federal government will forcibly remove and relocate American Indian populations in the 1830s. During the Trail of Tears 血泪之路 in 1838, the U.S. Army forced the Cherokee people west, and this forced march 强制迁徙 of thousands of miles led to the loss of many Cherokee lives.

That's going to do it for Andrew Jackson. Check out the links in the description for videos on these topics, and until next time, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们来探讨安德鲁·杰克逊的总统任期。

19 世纪初，白人男性普选权有所扩大。财产要求被取消，从而使大多数白人男性拥有了投票权。1828 年安德鲁·杰克逊的当选象征着这个“平民”政治参与度提高的时代。不幸的是，当我们说“平民”时，我们只谈论白人——特别是白人男性。

杰克逊被认为是第一位所谓的“平民”出身的总统，他是一位战争英雄。但杰克逊的胜利分裂了民主共和党，并导致了民主党和辉格党的形成。民主党由安德鲁·杰克逊领导，辉格党由亨利·克莱领导。在第二个两党制时期，民主党和辉格党在联邦政府的角色和权力以及国家银行、关税和联邦资助的国内基础设施建设等问题上存在分歧。

让我们来看一些例子。1828 年关税旨在提高关税。1828 年关税使外国商品更加昂贵，这将导致更多人购买美国制造的商品。这将使北方制造商受益。南方各州反对提高关税，由于关税使进口商品更加昂贵，这损害了美国非制造业消费者的利益。更不用说，关税导致欧洲国家可能对南方棉花采取报复性关税。

1832 年，国会通过了另一项关税，进一步加剧了地区紧张局势。南方人将 1828 年关税称为“可憎关税”。在他们看来，这项关税除了偏袒北方制造商之外没有任何作用。1828 年，副总统约翰·C·卡尔霍恩秘密撰写了《南卡罗来纳州阐述与抗议》，其中概述了无效化思想。无效化是指一个州可以无视他们认为不公正或违宪的联邦政府的法令或法律。1828 年关税的结果是《无效权宣言》。

1832 年的无效化危机是由保护性关税问题引起的。1832 年，南卡罗来纳州宣布他们不会在该州执行关税。此外，卡尔霍恩认为，如果州权受到侵犯，脱离联邦是可能的。现在要明确的是，安德鲁·杰克逊不支持无效化。杰克逊认为，一个州没有权利无效化一项联邦法律——即使是杰克逊也不支持的关税。杰克逊威胁要使用联邦武力来执行联邦法律，并敦促国会在 1833 年通过《武力法案》，该法案赋予总统权力，在州拒绝遵守联邦关税的情况下，可以使用军队来强制征收进口关税。

《武力法案》和亨利·克莱在 1833 年提出的降低关税的提案都有助于结束无效化危机。南卡罗来纳州最终退缩了。虽然这场危机最终通过武力威胁和妥协得以解决——有时被称为橄榄枝和剑——但无效化危机再次暴露了南方和北方之间的地区紧张关系，说明了关于州与联邦政府之间关系的持续辩论，并且无效化危机再次成为一个例子，当一个州不同意联邦政府的行动时，它威胁要脱离联邦。

现在杰克逊不会成为所有联邦政府事务的捍卫者。对于那些喜欢讽刺的人来说，尽管杰克逊最终会被印在 20 美元的钞票上，但他并不喜欢国家银行。杰克逊反对美国第二银行，因为他认为该银行偏袒精英和富人。杰克逊还认为国家银行违宪，尽管最高法院在麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案中裁定美国银行合宪。

1832 年，国会议员亨利·克莱支持一项延长美国第二银行特许状的法案。杰克逊——在这里看起来像 19 世纪的皮条客——否决了旨在延长银行特许状的法案。这项否决意味着美国国家银行将在其特许状到期后 4 年内消失。杰克逊不想等待美国银行的任期到期，而是想采取措施摧毁美国第二银行。1833 年，杰克逊下令将所有联邦资金从美国第二银行撤出，并将这笔钱存入各州的“宠物银行”。由于它们对杰克逊政府的忠诚，所以被称为“宠物银行”。结果，杰克逊得以摧毁美国第二银行。银行的终结助长了 1837 年的经济恐慌，这是一场导致大范围失业的经济崩溃，也导致这家伙喝得烂醉，在这个女士和孩子周围的地板上跳舞。

关于国家银行的辩论加剧了国家的党派之争和分裂，并最终促成了第二个两党制——辉格党和民主党的兴起。辉格党是反对杰克逊的人。他们认为杰克逊通过反复使用否决权、攻击银行以及其他行政权力的使用，表现得像个国王。辉格党认为杰克逊将总统职位视为君主制。辉格党倾向于支持强大的中央政府，并且通常支持亨利·克莱的美国体系。

另一方面，在平民时代，杰克逊确实获得了大量支持。杰克逊领导下的民主党主张建立一个弱小的国家政府，并且通常反对政府干预经济事务和社会问题。杰克逊对银行的攻击、他使用将新人引入政府的“分赃制度”，甚至他使用否决权都被他的支持者视为他捍卫和争取平民权利的证据。但在他的总统任期内，对杰克逊的反对导致了辉格党的形成和两党制的回归。

毫无疑问，杰克逊总统任期最具争议的部分是他对待美洲印第安人的方式。在 19 世纪早期，许多美国定居者支持扩大美国领土的努力。这种扩张的主要动机是渴望找到新的耕地。当美国人向西迁移到东南部的佐治亚州等地时，那里存在着声称对这片土地拥有主权的既有美洲印第安部落。这些部落被称为“五大文明部落”，他们声称拥有美国东南部许多南方人希望获得用于棉花生产的土地。

1828 年在佐治亚州北部发现黄金后，局势变得紧张，这被用作佐治亚州企图从切罗基人手中夺取土地的理由。切罗基民族起诉佐治亚州以保留对其土地的权利，在最高法院伍斯特诉佐治亚州案中，最高法院裁定切罗基民族拥有主权。这意味着佐治亚州无权在切罗基领土上执行州法律——这片土地是他们的。然而，杰克逊拒绝执行最高法院伍斯特诉佐治亚州案的裁决，并完全无视了该裁决。

就在最高法院判决之前，1830 年国会通过并由杰克逊签署成为法律的《1830 年印第安人迁移法案》强迫该地区所有美洲印第安部落迁移到密西西比河以西地区。该地区的各个部落将尝试不同的抵抗形式。塞米诺尔印第安人将与美国军队进行一系列战争，正如我们所看到的，切罗基人将试图利用美国的法律体系来保护他们对土地的权利。虽然最高法院确实确认了美洲印第安人对土地的权利，但最终在安德鲁·杰克逊领导下，联邦政府将在 1830 年代强行迁移美洲印第安人。在 1838 年的“血泪之路”期间，美国陆军强迫切罗基人向西迁移，这场数千英里的强行迁移导致了许多切罗基人的丧生。

关于安德鲁·杰克逊的内容就到此为止。查看描述中的视频链接了解这些主题，下次再见，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
