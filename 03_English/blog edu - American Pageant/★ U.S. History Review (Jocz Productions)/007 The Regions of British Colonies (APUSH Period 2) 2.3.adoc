What's up, beautiful people? Today I'm going to explain the regions of the British colonies.

The first of the British North American colonies would be founded in the Chesapeake region. When we are talking about the Chesapeake region, we are talking about the colonies of Virginia and Maryland. The first of the permanent British colonies will be at Jamestown in 1607.

To finance this colony, the Virginia Company of London would be created. Joint stock companies 股份公司 allowed money to be raised for colonization and the risks associated with colonization to be shared by many investors.

In the beginning, the Jamestown colony was a hot mess — a bunch of dudes, people were starving, eventually they resorted to cannibalism 食人肉. Beef, it's what's for dinner. But things turned around after the colonists got some help from the local Powhatan tribe. John Smith established military discipline 纪律 in the colony, and another John figured out exporting tobacco would make mucho dinero (money 钱). But don't smoke, kiddos.

Tobacco will be the cash crop 经济作物 of the Chesapeake and also the colony in North Carolina. And now, while the wacky tobacco will make the colony finally profitable, it was a labor-intensive 劳动密集型的 crop. Unlike our Spanish amigos, the English will not rely on Native American labor — they would just run away rather than work for the British.

So at first, labor will be done by white indentured servants 契约仆役 from Europe. These will be made up of individuals hoping going to the New World will provide them with some upward social mobility 流动性；晋升机会. And in exchange for passage 通行；旅程 to the New World, indentured servants agreed to work for a period of time, usually around four to seven years.

Now, indentured servants were not the only source of labor. Slavery 奴隶制；奴役 will be in the Jamestown colony starting in 1619, and eventually white indentured servants will be replaced by primarily enslaved people from Africa. This development won't happen until after the elite 上层集团；精英 class gets scared to death by Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, and we will cover that in another video.

It's going to be a very different story over in the New England colonies north of the Chesapeake. Whereas in the Chesapeake it was all about trying to get that loot, in the New England colonies it was a group of people called Puritans 清教徒 trying to live out God's plan. The first group to the New England region were Pilgrims 清教徒前辈移民, a group of religious separatists 分离主义者 who established the Plymouth Colony in 1620.

Before even setting foot in North America, the male colonists signed the Mayflower Compact 五月花号公约, an agreement that established basic government based upon majority rule 多数统治. Following the Pilgrims in Plymouth were the Puritans led by John Winthrop. This colony was financed 资助；提供资金 by the Massachusetts Bay Company, and Winthrop established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the New England region.

Winthrop and his followers were hoping to establish a "city upon a hill" — an ideal religious community that could serve as an example to the rest of the world. Quick tip: if you ever forget who founded a British colony, there is a good chance his name is John.

Generally speaking, the New England colonies developed around small towns with family farms. In contrast to 与……形成对比 the Chesapeake region which was primarily built around tobacco, the New England colonies relied on a mixed economy 混合经济 of farming and trade.

In between the New England and Chesapeake colonies was the Middle Colonies. The Middle Colonies relied on a broad range of European migrants 移民, and as a result the Middle Colonies featured societies with great cultural, ethnic 种族的 and religious diversity 多样性.

A couple examples of this diversity: Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn, a Quaker 贵格会教徒 who established a colony of great religious toleration 宽容；容忍. Many people came to Pennsylvania, and the demographics 人口统计数据 reflected a mix of not only Quakers but also Scots-Irish, Germans and various other groups. The colony of New York would be established where the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam had been. The British rolled up in 1664 and snatched 夺取；抢走 the Dutch colony from the Netherlands.

In terms of economics, the Middle Colonies relied on an export economy 出口经济 based upon cereal crops 谷物 and other items you could see on the map. Sadly, they did not export Cocoa Pebbles, my favorite cereal as a kid — basically diabetes in breakfast form. And go ahead and let me know in the comments what you think is the greatest cereal ever.

The last region of the British colonies were those along the southern Atlantic coast and in the British West Indies. Both these areas had the benefit of a long growing season to support the development of plantation economies 种植园经济 that typically exported a staple crop 主要作物. In the West Indies, that crop tended to be sugar cane 甘蔗, and in colonies such as South Carolina and Georgia it included rice, tobacco and eventually cotton.

As a result of this cash crop export economy, these regions relied on the labor of enslaved Africans. In the West Indies and South Carolina, this resulted in the majority of the population consisting of primarily African people. Cash crops such as tobacco in Virginia, rice in South Carolina and sugar cane in the Caribbean will be exported to England, and once again mean these regions will be much more heavily reliant on 依赖 the labor of enslaved people.

The big idea here though is this: starting in the 17th century and into the 18th century, British colonies developed along the Atlantic coast. Distinct 独特的 regional differences between the colonies reflected environmental, cultural, demographic 人口结构的 and cultural factors. All of these colonies were under the British authority 权威；权力, yet they developed into distinct societies.

And although technically they're under British authority, from 1607 to 1763 these colonies would each develop relatively free of British control. Couple reasons for this: Britain is hella far, or as some people annoyingly say "across the pond" — bro, it's the Atlantic Ocean, it's slightly bigger than a dang pond. Also during this time, Britain will have its own internal affairs 内部事务 to attend to, leaving the colonies to create their own self-governing institutions 机构 that were unusually democratic compared to the situation in Europe.

For instance, the New England colonies had town hall meetings in which male church-going members could engage in 参与 colonial decision-making. Southern colonies also had their own colonial legislatures 立法机构. While the House of Burgesses in Virginia was primarily made up of the elite planter class 种植园主阶级, it did give a great degree of decision-making and local authority to the colonists in Virginia.

In my next video, I'll be taking a look at the transatlantic trade 跨大西洋贸易 — how that money's being made and regulate 管理；控制 it. Until then, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我将解释英国殖民地的各个区域。

英国北美洲殖民地最早建立于切萨皮克地区。当我们谈论切萨皮克地区时，我们指的是弗吉尼亚和马里兰殖民地。第一个永久性英国殖民地将于 1607 年在詹姆斯敦建立。

为了资助这个殖民地，伦敦的弗吉尼亚公司成立了。股份公司允许为殖民活动筹集资金，并让许多投资者分担与殖民相关的风险。

最初，詹姆斯敦殖民地一片混乱——一群男人，人们挨饿，最终他们甚至开始同类相食。“牛肉，晚餐吃牛肉。”但在殖民者得到当地波瓦坦部落的帮助后，情况有所好转。约翰·史密斯在殖民地建立了军事纪律，而另一个约翰发现出口烟草会带来大量财富。但孩子们，不要吸烟。

烟草将成为切萨皮克以及北卡罗来纳殖民地的经济作物。现在，虽然这种奇异的烟草最终将使殖民地盈利，但它是一种劳动密集型作物。与我们的西班牙朋友不同，英国人不会依赖美洲原住民的劳动力——他们宁愿逃跑也不愿为英国人工作。

因此，最初的劳动力将由来自欧洲的白人契约仆人承担。这些人希望前往新世界能为他们提供一些社会地位上升的机会。作为前往新世界的报酬，契约仆人同意工作一段时间，通常约为四到七年。

现在，契约仆人并非唯一的劳动力来源。奴隶制将于 1619 年在詹姆斯敦殖民地开始，最终白人契约仆人将被主要来自非洲的被奴役人民所取代。这一发展直到 1676 年精英阶层被培根叛乱吓得半死之后才会发生，我们将在另一个视频中介绍这一点。

在切萨皮克以北的新英格兰殖民地，情况将大不相同。切萨皮克地区一切都围绕着获取财富，而在新英格兰殖民地，一群被称为清教徒的人试图实现上帝的旨意。第一批到达新英格兰地区的是朝圣者，这是一群宗教分离主义者，他们在 1620 年建立了普利茅斯殖民地。

甚至在踏上北美洲的土地之前，男性殖民者就签署了《五月花号公约》，这是一项基于多数原则建立基本政府的协议。在普利茅斯的朝圣者之后是约翰·温思罗普领导的清教徒。这个殖民地由马萨诸塞湾公司资助，温思罗普在新英格兰地区建立了马萨诸塞湾殖民地。

温思罗普和他的追随者希望建立一个“山巅之城”——一个理想的宗教社区，可以作为世界其他地方的榜样。小提示：如果你总是忘记是谁建立了哪个英国殖民地，很有可能他的名字叫约翰。

一般来说，新英格兰殖民地围绕着以家庭农场为主的小城镇发展起来。与主要围绕烟草建立的切萨皮克地区形成对比，新英格兰殖民地依赖于农业和贸易相结合的混合经济。

位于新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地之间的是中部殖民地。中部殖民地依赖于广泛的欧洲移民，因此，中部殖民地的社会具有极大的文化、民族和宗教多样性。

这种多样性的几个例子：宾夕法尼亚由威廉·佩恩创立，他是一位贵格会教徒，建立了一个宗教高度宽容的殖民地。许多人来到宾夕法尼亚，人口结构反映了不仅有贵格会教徒，还有苏格兰-爱尔兰人、德国人和其他各种群体。纽约殖民地将在荷兰的新阿姆斯特丹殖民地的基础上建立。英国人于 1664 年入侵并从荷兰手中夺取了该殖民地。

在经济方面，中部殖民地依赖于以谷物和其他你可以在地图上看到的物品为基础的出口经济。可悲的是，他们没有出口可可卵石，那是我小时候最喜欢的谷物——基本上是早餐形式的糖尿病。请在评论中告诉我你认为有史以来最棒的谷物是什么。

英国殖民地的最后一个区域是沿南部大西洋沿岸和英属西印度群岛的地区。这两个地区都受益于漫长的生长季节，这支持了通常出口主要作物的种植园经济的发展。在西印度群岛，这种作物往往是甘蔗，而在南卡罗来纳和佐治亚等殖民地，则包括大米、烟草，最终还有棉花。

由于这种经济作物的出口经济，这些地区依赖于被奴役的非洲人的劳动。在西印度群岛和南卡罗来纳，这导致人口的大多数主要是非洲人。弗吉尼亚的烟草、南卡罗来纳的大米和加勒比海的甘蔗等经济作物将被出口到英国，这再次意味着这些地区将更加严重地依赖被奴役人民的劳动。

但这里的主要思想是：从 17 世纪到 18 世纪，英国殖民地沿着大西洋沿岸发展起来。殖民地之间明显的区域差异反映了环境、文化、人口和文化因素。所有这些殖民地都处于英国的统治之下，但它们发展成为不同的社会。

虽然从技术上讲它们处于英国的统治之下，但从 1607 年到 1763 年，这些殖民地都相对自由地发展，不受英国的控制。原因有几个：英国非常遥远，或者像有些人烦人地说的那样“隔着池塘”——兄弟，那是大西洋，它比一个该死的池塘大得多。此外，在此期间，英国将有自己的内部事务要处理，这使得殖民地能够建立自己管理机构，与欧洲的情况相比，这些机构异常民主。

例如，新英格兰殖民地有镇议会会议，男性教会成员可以参与殖民地的决策。南部殖民地也有自己的殖民地立法机构。虽然弗吉尼亚的众议院主要由精英种植园主阶级组成，但它确实给予了弗吉尼亚殖民者很大的决策权和地方自治权。

在我的下一个视频中，我将探讨跨大西洋贸易——这些钱是如何赚取的以及如何监管它。在那之前，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
