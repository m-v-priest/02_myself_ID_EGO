What's going down 发生什么事 everyone? Thank you for checking out 查看 another Joe's Productions video. Today we're going to break down 分析 the European rivalries 竞争 in North America and really one of the most important wars you should know about - the French and Indian War 法国-印第安人战争. No matter which book you're using for APUSH (美国历史先修课程), this video is going to help you out with these topics.

So who are England's colonial rivals 殖民对手 in North America? The big one is France. The father of New France 新法兰西 is Samuel de Champlain - he founded 建立 Quebec 魁北克 in 1608 (one year after Jamestown). You could see it right there on the map, and all that area in the blue is eventually going to be part of New France. They have a couple of different motives 动机 for colonization, and the first key one is they're going to be very active in the fur trade 毛皮贸易 economy, and they're going to need very close relations with the native people in order to maintain 维持 this trade.

You're also going to see the arrival of Catholic Jesuit missionaries 耶稣会传教士 - their goal is to convert 使皈依 the native people to Catholicism 天主教. We already mentioned the Dutch 荷兰人 - they're not a really big colony, they're rather small. They're engaged in 从事 trade/commerce 商业, very diverse 多样化的 colony (more than half the people were not even Dutch), and as a result the English take over 接管 that colony and New Amsterdam becomes New York.

Spain is also attempting settlements 定居点 but very important to keep in mind when you're talking about New Spain in North America - it's going to be very sparsely populated 人口稀少的. There's mainly going to be (as you could see on the map right there) some forts 堡垒 such as that in St. Augustine 圣奥古斯丁, but no major settlements because the bulk of 大部分的 Spanish colonization will take place in Latin America 拉丁美洲.

Some key differences between the French, Dutch and Spanish colonies versus 对比 the British (make sure you know about these):

There are much fewer European settlers 欧洲移民 when it comes to the French, the Dutch and the Spanish - they don't bring the massive number of people that the English did in their 13 colonies.
The French, the Dutch and the Spanish are going to have much more extensive 广泛的 trade alliances 贸易联盟 with American Indians, especially with regard to 关于 fur to be exported 出口 to Europe, whereas in the English colonies not a lot of trade going down.
Finally, intermarriage 通婚 was much more common between the French and the Spanish and Native Americans than it was with the British - very rare to have intermarriage between British and Native American people.
So in the early 18th century, that's how the continent looked between really France, Spain and England. And there's going to be three colonial wars that occurred prior to 在...之前 the big one - the French and Indian War. And you don't really need to know all the details for these wars, but let me just mention: you have King William's War 威廉王之战, you have Queen Anne's War 安妮女王之战, and you have King George's War 乔治王之战 (they're all named after the king that they took place during).

And all of them really are world wars - they start over in Europe, they spread (the fighting spreads to America and other places), and you got all sorts of things happening. Georgia is attacked by Spain during one of these wars (James Oglethorpe defends 保卫 the colony), but these wars are secondary 次要的 in the Americas - they're mainly fought over in Europe. At stake 处于危险中 is control of the West Indies 西印度群岛 (very lucrative 利润丰厚的 trade in that region) but also North America - the 13 colonies and Canada.

So these wars are going to have consequences 后果 in different regions. And as I already mentioned, the first three wars were mainly fought in Europe. While these wars are taking place, there is this concept known as salutary neglect 有益的忽视, and this basically means the British policy of avoiding strict enforcement 严格执行 of their laws and regulations 法规. So things like the Navigation Acts 航海条例 are not being strictly enforced, and that's because England's preoccupied with 忙于 other issues both internally 内部地 and externally 外部地. And in the words of Michael Jackson, salutary neglect meant the colonies were being "just left alone."

Another important development that's occurring is colonists looking for new land headed west across the Appalachian Mountains 阿巴拉契亚山脉. And the Appalachian Mountains kind of run along 沿着...延伸 the east coast, and they're moving further away from British control and they're also moving into territory 领土 claimed by France. And that's going to really be the kind of backdrop 背景 for the situation that occurs in 1754 in the Ohio Valley 俄亥俄河谷.

So as colonists are moving into this Ohio Valley, both the British and the French start building forts in this region (you could see those forts on the map). You have a French fort called Fort Duquesne 迪凯纳堡, you have the British also building forts, and really the French are building forts in the Ohio Valley to try to stop these colonial settlements.

And what ends up happening is a war begins when a Virginian by the name of George Washington fights against the French and their Native American allies 盟友. The governor of Virginia sends a small militia 民兵 under George Washington's leadership, and he and his men engage in 参与 a battle between the French and their native allies, and this sparks 引发 the French and Indian War.

This is a hugely important war - the French and Indian War (or the Seven Years' War 七年战争 as it's known in Europe). It will last for (you'll never guess it) seven years, and it will have a dramatic impact 重大影响 on the relationship between the colonies and England. You could see on the map the before and the after.

Before we take a look at why this radical transformation 彻底转变 takes place, it's important to keep in mind that initially 最初 the war was a disaster 灾难 for the British and the colonists. The French and their Indian allies are kicking butt 占据上风. In order to try to deal with the war effort, an Albany plan or meeting is called. The British wanted to coordinate 协调 the war effort between them and the colonies, and they wanted to help promote colonial defense 殖民防御 (remember these 13 colonies were very kind of independent from one another - how do we fight together?).

So representatives 代表 from seven colonies meet in Albany, New York in 1754 at this intercolonial meeting 殖民地间会议, and they got to figure out how are we going to beat France? And they also have another purpose in meeting which is to get the powerful Iroquois tribe 易洛魁部落 out of neutrality 中立 (this tribe was very prominent 突出的 in the New York area) and they want to get them on the side of the British and the colonists.

Ben Franklin plays a key role at this Albany conference - he develops the Albany Plan of Union 奥尔巴尼联盟计划, and this was really intended to help coordinate troop movements 军队调动 and to collect taxes 征税 and ultimately to promote colonial unity 殖民统一. His famous "Join or Die" 不联合即死亡 political cartoon 政治漫画 is one of the earliest (if not the first) in colonial America.

And in spite of 尽管 it being really awesome and stressing the importance of unity, colonial jealousy 嫉妒 and a tradition of not working together led to the plan being rejected 拒绝 (the colonists basically saying "No thank you, we don't really want to work together"). What is important though about the Albany Plan is it established a precedent 先例 for later meetings in cooperation 合作. And ironically enough 具有讽刺意味的是, later on these colonies will be meeting to discuss not France but rather resistance 抵抗 against England.

Eventually the war starts turning in the favor of the British and the colonists. You got a guy by the name of William Pitt who starts doing some things, and the continent that once looked like this in 1750 following the Treaty of Paris 巴黎条约 in 1763 looks like this. What happened to France?

1763 is a hugely important year - it is the official year of the Peace of Paris 巴黎和约. England gains French territory 领土 all the way from Canada down into Florida (which was acquired 获得 from Spain). They also take French land from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to the Mississippi River 密西西比河. You do see Spain acquiring French territory west of the Mississippi River, and France is effectively kicked out of 被赶出 North America (they do maintain 保留 a small colony over here in Haiti - a very profitable colony - more on that a little bit later).

Once again, this is a huge turning point 转折点 - England established supremacy 霸权 of North America. Big idea: 1763 not only is the Treaty of Paris, but it also is the start of a lot of drama 戏剧性事件. Salutary neglect will come to an end following the French and Indian War in the year (you guessed it) 1763.

The colonists who had grown accustomed to 习惯于 a large measure of autonomy 自治 (freedom to do as they wanted) are now going to find England assuming direct control 直接控制 over the colonies. A lot of things are going to change in 1763 because, as I said, it is a turning point in the relationship between the colonies and England.

One of the big things that's going to change is England will emerge from 从...中摆脱 the war (the Seven Years' War) with massive debt 巨额债务, and this will lead to a whole host of 大量的 taxes being passed. England's going to seek to consolidate 巩固 their imperial control 帝国控制 over the North American colonies, and one of the ways they're going to do this is through taxes (we'll cover that in our next video).

Another key thing that happens in 1763 is Pontiac's Rebellion 庞蒂亚克起义. And remember the native people lost a valuable trading partner when France was kicked out (England's not really trading with the native people like France was). Not only that, but native people have to worry about colonists moving into their land at a much more rapid pace 更快的速度.

As a result, Pontiac's Rebellion takes place. Pontiac was an Ottawa chief 渥太华酋长 - he forged 建立 a western confederation 西部联盟 and he rebels against colonists encroaching on 侵占 native land. This rebellion takes place throughout the frontier 边疆 as colonial settlements are attacked. There is horrible violence taking place throughout the frontier, and some colonists take matters into their own hands 自己处理问题.

And this is where you have the Paxton Boys 帕克斯顿男孩 - these were western Pennsylvania colonists (they're mainly Scots-Irish immigrants 苏格兰-爱尔兰移民) and they start randomly attacking native people. They're a vigilante group 治安维持团体 - they start demanding that the colonial government do something about these attacks. And the Paxton Boys eventually march to Philadelphia demanding the government address their grievances 不满 (they want protection).

In this process though, they start murdering innocent 无辜的 native people who had nothing to do with Pontiac's Rebellion. Eventually the British are forced to send in additional troops 增派部队 to stop Pontiac's rebellion and to protect the colonists (you could see the huge increase of troops taking place especially in the Ohio Valley all the way up into Canada). And of course, troops cost money.

Eventually Pontiac's Rebellion is defeated, and this leads (Pontiac's Rebellion leads) to the British passing a very important act called The Proclamation Act of 1763 1763年公告令. This was intended to prevent hostilities 敌对行动 between Native Americans and colonists, but it's going to create bitter feelings 怨恨. Remember all this used to be France's - now it's England's.

Here's what it did: it prohibited 禁止 colonists from moving west of the Appalachian Mountains. It basically drew a line that said "colonists you cannot go past this line." The British felt that if they move west that this would lead to conflict and cost the crown 王室 more money. And colonists were angry and openly defied 公然违抗 the British policy - they are moving west regardless of 不管 this proclamation.

And this is creating more and more tension 紧张, and it's really important you know the differences between the British and the colonists' views following the French and Indian War.

In the minds of the British:

They were disappointed in 对...失望 the colonial military contributions 军事贡献 to the French and Indian War
They felt that the colonists were unable and unwilling 不愿意 to defend themselves on the frontier
The war started in North America (unlike those other three wars)
And the outcome 结果 benefited the colonists so they should help pay for it (and that's going to lead to new taxes and also policies such as the Proclamation Act of 1763)
Wars were expensive - you need troops in North America so the colonists should pay their fair share 公平份额
Don't forget as well that the war marks the end of salutary neglect (so that means the enforcement of the Navigation Acts and other laws the colonists were used to not abiding by 遵守)
And as a result following the war, the British are going to assume direct control over the colonies
In the minds of the colonists:

They felt they had contributed to 贡献于 the defense of the colonies in all four of the wars
They felt they fought bravely 勇敢地
And they wanted access to 获得 the new frontier land since the French are gone
And the British policies were violating 侵犯 their liberties 自由
So you could see this tension starting to build up 积累. However, it's important to note intercolonial disunity 殖民地间的不团结 remains strong. The colonists are not calling for or even discussing independence 独立 yet, but the tensions are starting to mount 加剧.

大家好！感谢收看乔伊制作的又一期视频。今天我们要解析北美地区的欧洲列强竞争，特别是你们必须了解的最重要战争之一——法国印第安人战争。无论你使用哪本AP美国史教材，这个视频都会帮你掌握这些知识点。

那么英国在北美的主要殖民对手是谁呢？最大的对手是法国。新法兰西之父是萨缪尔·德·尚普兰——他于1608年（詹姆斯敦建立后一年）建立了魁北克。你可以在地图上看到，所有蓝色区域最终都成为新法兰西的一部分。法国人的殖民动机有几个关键点：首先他们积极参与毛皮贸易经济，为此需要与原住民保持密切关系。

你还会看到天主教耶稣会传教士的到来——他们的目标是让原住民改信天主教。我们之前提到过的荷兰人——他们的殖民地不大，规模较小。主要从事贸易商业活动，殖民地非常多元化（超过半数居民甚至不是荷兰人），最终英国人接管了这个殖民地，新阿姆斯特丹变成了纽约。

西班牙也尝试建立定居点，但要记住北美新西班牙地区人口非常稀少。正如地图所示，主要只有圣奥古斯丁等少数要塞，没有大型定居点，因为西班牙殖民重心在拉丁美洲。

法、荷、西殖民地与英国殖民地有几个关键区别（务必掌握）：

法、荷、西殖民地的欧洲移民数量远少于英国——他们没有像英国13个殖民地那样带来大量人口
法、荷、西殖民者与原住民建立了更广泛的贸易联盟，特别是向欧洲出口毛皮，而英国殖民地贸易活动较少
法国和西班牙殖民者与原住民通婚的情况比英国普遍得多——英国人与原住民通婚非常罕见
18世纪初期，北美大陆的格局基本就是法、西、英三国鼎立。在法国印第安人战争之前发生过三次殖民地战争（不需要掌握所有细节）：威廉王战争、安妮女王战争和乔治王战争（都以当时在位的英国君主命名）。

这些战争实际上都是世界性战争——始于欧洲，战火蔓延到美洲等地。乔治亚在战争期间曾遭西班牙攻击（詹姆斯·奥格尔索普保卫了殖民地），但这些战争在美洲属于次要战场，主战场在欧洲。争夺焦点是利润丰厚的西印度群岛贸易权，也包括北美13个殖民地和加拿大的控制权。

战争期间出现了"有益的忽视"政策——英国避免严格执行各项法规（如《航海条例》），因为他们正忙于处理国内外其他问题。用迈克尔·杰克逊的话说，殖民地"被放任自流"了。

另一个重要发展是殖民者向西穿越阿巴拉契亚山脉寻找新土地。这座山脉沿东海岸延伸，殖民者向西迁移既脱离了英国控制，也进入了法国宣称的领土——这成为1754年俄亥俄河谷冲突的背景。

随着殖民者进入俄亥俄河谷，英法双方都开始在该地区修建要塞（地图上可见）。法国建造了杜肯堡，英国也在修建要塞——法国人建堡正是为了阻止殖民者西进。

最终，当名叫乔治·华盛顿的弗吉尼亚人率军与法国及其原住民盟友交战时，战争爆发了。弗吉尼亚总督派华盛顿率领一小支民兵，他们与法军及其原住民盟友的战斗引发了法国印第安人战争。

这场战争（在欧洲称为七年战争）极其重要，持续了七年（猜到了吧），深刻改变了殖民地与英国的关系。地图清楚展现了战前战后格局变化。

在分析这种剧变原因前，要记住战争初期对英国和殖民者来说简直是灾难——法国人和印第安盟友势如破竹。为协调战事，英国召开了奥尔巴尼会议，希望与殖民地协同作战（记住13个殖民地原本各自为政）。

1754年，七个殖民地的代表在纽约奥尔巴尼召开跨殖民地会议，商讨如何击败法国，同时争取让强大的易洛魁联盟放弃中立（这个部落在纽约地区很有影响力），站到英国一方。

本杰明·富兰克林在会议上提出《奥尔巴尼联盟计划》，旨在协调军队调动、征税并促进殖民地联合。他著名的"不联合即死亡"政治漫画是殖民地最早（如果不是第一幅）的政治漫画。

尽管这个强调团结的计划很棒，但由于殖民地间的猜忌和不合作传统，计划被拒绝了（殖民者基本在说"谢谢，不必了"）。但重要的是，该计划为后来的合作会议开创了先例。讽刺的是，后来这些殖民地再次集会讨论的不是对抗法国，而是反抗英国。

战局最终转向有利于英国。威廉·皮特采取行动后，1750年的北美大陆格局通过1763年《巴黎和约》变成这样：法国怎么了？

1763年是关键转折点——《巴黎和约》签订。英国获得了从加拿大到佛罗里达（从西班牙手中获得）的全部法属领土，以及阿巴拉契亚山脉至密西西比河的土地。西班牙获得了密西西比河以西的法属领地，法国实质上被逐出北美（只保留了海地这个小而利润丰厚的殖民地）。

1763年不仅是和约签订年，更是一系列剧变的开端。"有益的忽视"政策在法国印第安人战争结束后（你猜对了）1763年终止。习惯了高度自治的殖民者将面临英国的直接管控——这是殖民地与英国关系的转折点。

重大变化包括：英国因战争背负巨额债务，将导致一系列征税；寻求巩固对北美殖民地的控制（下个视频详述税收问题）。

1763年还爆发了庞蒂亚克起义。原住民失去了法国这个重要贸易伙伴（英国不像法国那样与原住民贸易），更要担心殖民者加速西进侵占土地。

庞蒂亚克是渥太华部落首领，他组建西部联盟反抗殖民者侵占。起义席卷边境，殖民定居点遭袭。在暴力事件中，出现了自发的"帕克斯顿男孩"组织——主要由苏格兰-爱尔兰移民组成的宾夕法尼亚西部殖民者，开始无差别攻击原住民。这个治安团体最终向费城进军，要求政府提供保护，过程中却杀害了许多与起义无关的无辜原住民。

英国被迫增派军队镇压起义（可见俄亥俄河谷至加拿大驻军大增），当然军费开支巨大。起义被镇压后，英国颁布了极其重要的《1763年公告令》，旨在防止冲突却引发怨恨。该法令禁止殖民者越过阿巴拉契亚山脉西进，画出一条"不得逾越"的界线。英国认为西进会引发冲突增加开支，而殖民者公然违抗继续西进，矛盾日益激化。

理解英殖民双方在战后的不同观点至关重要：

英国方面：
• 对殖民地的战争贡献失望
• 认为殖民者无力也不愿自卫
• 战争始于北美（不同于前三场）
• 殖民者是最大受益者应当分担成本（导致新税和《1763年公告令》）
• 战争耗资巨大需要殖民者分担
• "有益的忽视"终结（开始严格执行《航海条例》等法律）
• 战后将直接管控殖民地

殖民者方面：
• 认为自己为四场战争都做出贡献
• 自认作战英勇
• 渴望获得原法属西部土地
• 认为英国政策侵犯自由

虽然矛盾在积累，但要注意殖民地仍不团结——尚未出现独立呼声，但紧张局势正在升级。

今天的视频就到这里。如果觉得有收获，请点赞视频、推荐频道并订阅。如果你去匹兹堡（钢人队主场），不妨看看俄亥俄河谷的杜肯堡遗址。下次见，祝愉快！再见！

What's going down everyone? Thank you for checking out another Joe's Productions video. Today we're going to break down the European rivalries in North America and really one of the most important wars you should know about - the French and Indian War.

And you don't really need to know all the details for these wars, but let me just mention: you have King William's War, you have Queen Anne's War, and you have King George's War (they're all named after the king that they took place during).

Georgia is attacked by Spain during one of these wars (James Oglethorpe defends the colony), but these wars are secondary in the Americas - they're mainly fought over in Europe. At stake is control of the West Indies (very lucrative trade in that region) but also North America - the 13 colonies and Canada.

So these wars are going to have consequences in different regions. And as I already mentioned, the first three wars were mainly fought in Europe. While these wars are taking place, there is this concept known as salutary neglect, and this basically means the British policy of avoiding strict enforcement of their laws and regulations. So things like the Navigation Acts are not being strictly enforced, and that's because England's preoccupied with other issues both internally and externally. And in the words of Michael Jackson, salutary neglect meant the colonies were being "just left alone."

Another important development that's occurring is colonists looking for new land headed west across the Appalachian Mountains. And the Appalachian Mountains kind of run along the east coast, and they're moving further away from British control and they're also moving into territory claimed by France. And that's going to really be the kind of backdrop for the situation that occurs in 1754 in the Ohio Valley.

So as colonists are moving into this Ohio Valley, both the British and the French start building forts in this region (you could see those forts on the map). You have a French fort called Fort Duquesne, you have the British also building forts, and really the French are building forts in the Ohio Valley to try to stop these colonial settlements.

And what ends up happening is a war begins when a Virginian by the name of George Washington fights against the French and their Native American allies. The governor of Virginia sends a small militia under George Washington's leadership, and he and his men engage in a battle between the French and their native allies, and this sparks the French and Indian War.

This is a hugely important war - the French and Indian War (or the Seven Years' War as it's known in Europe). It will last for (you'll never guess it) seven years, and it will have a dramatic impact on the relationship between the colonies and England. You could see on the map the before and the after.

Before we take a look at why this radical transformation takes place, it's important to keep in mind that initially the war was a disaster for the British and the colonists. The French and their Indian allies are kicking butt. In order to try to deal with the war effort, an Albany plan or meeting is called. The British wanted to coordinate the war effort between them and the colonies, and they wanted to help promote colonial defense (remember these 13 colonies were very kind of independent from one another - how do we fight together?).

So representatives from seven colonies meet in Albany, New York in 1754 at this intercolonial meeting, and they got to figure out how are we going to beat France? And they also have another purpose in meeting which is to get the powerful Iroquois tribe out of neutrality (this tribe was very prominent in the New York area) and they want to get them on the side of the British and the colonists.

Ben Franklin plays a key role at this Albany conference - he develops the Albany Plan of Union, and this was really intended to help coordinate troop movements and to collect taxes and ultimately to promote colonial unity. His famous "Join or Die" political cartoon is one of the earliest (if not the first) in colonial America.

And in spite of it being really awesome and stressing the importance of unity, colonial jealousy and a tradition of not working together led to the plan being rejected (the colonists basically saying "No thank you, we don't really want to work together"). What is important though about the Albany Plan is it established a precedent for later meetings in cooperation. And ironically enough, later on these colonies will be meeting to discuss not France but rather resistance against England.

Eventually the war starts turning in the favor of the British and the colonists. You got a guy by the name of William Pitt who starts doing some things, and the continent that once looked like this in 1750 following the Treaty of Paris in 1763 looks like this. What happened to France?

1763 is a hugely important year - it is the official year of the Peace of Paris. England gains French territory all the way from Canada down into Florida (which was acquired from Spain). They also take French land from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to the Mississippi River. You do see Spain acquiring French territory west of the Mississippi River, and France is effectively kicked out of North America (they do maintain a small colony over here in Haiti - a very profitable colony - more on that a little bit later).

Once again, this is a huge turning point - England established supremacy of North America. Big idea: 1763 not only is the Treaty of Paris, but it also is the start of a lot of drama. Salutary neglect will come to an end following the French and Indian War in the year (you guessed it) 1763.

The colonists who had grown accustomed to a large measure of autonomy (freedom to do as they wanted) are now going to find England assuming direct control over the colonies. A lot of things are going to change in 1763 because, as I said, it is a turning point in the relationship between the colonies and England.

One of the big things that's going to change is England will emerge from the war (the Seven Years' War) with massive debt, and this will lead to a whole host of taxes being passed. England's going to seek to consolidate their imperial control over the North American colonies, and one of the ways they're going to do this is through taxes (we'll cover that in our next video).

Another key thing that happens in 1763 is Pontiac's Rebellion. And remember the native people lost a valuable trading partner when France was kicked out (England's not really trading with the native people like France was). Not only that, but native people have to worry about colonists moving into their land at a much more rapid pace.

As a result, Pontiac's Rebellion takes place. Pontiac was an Ottawa chief - he forged a western confederation and he rebels against colonists encroaching on native land. This rebellion takes place throughout the frontier as colonial settlements are attacked. There is horrible violence taking place throughout the frontier, and some colonists take matters into their own hands.

And this is where you have the Paxton Boys - these were western Pennsylvania colonists (they're mainly Scots-Irish immigrants) and they start randomly attacking native people. They're a vigilante group - they start demanding that the colonial government do something about these attacks. And the Paxton Boys eventually march to Philadelphia demanding the government address their grievances (they want protection).

In this process though, they start murdering innocent native people who had nothing to do with Pontiac's Rebellion. Eventually the British are forced to send in additional troops to stop Pontiac's rebellion and to protect the colonists (you could see the huge increase of troops taking place especially in the Ohio Valley all the way up into Canada). And of course, troops cost money.

Eventually Pontiac's Rebellion is defeated, and this leads (Pontiac's Rebellion leads) to the British passing a very important act called The Proclamation Act of 1763. This was intended to prevent hostilities between Native Americans and colonists, but it's going to create bitter feelings. Remember all this used to be France's - now it's England's.

Here's what it did: it prohibited colonists from moving west of the Appalachian Mountains. It basically drew a line that said "colonists you cannot go past this line." The British felt that if they move west that this would lead to conflict and cost the crown more money. And colonists were angry and openly defied the British policy - they are moving west regardless of this proclamation.

And this is creating more and more tension, and it's really important you know the differences between the British and the colonists' views following the French and Indian War.

In the minds of the British:

They were disappointed in the colonial military contributions to the French and Indian War
They felt that the colonists were unable and unwilling to defend themselves on the frontier
The war started in North America (unlike those other three wars)
And the outcome benefited the colonists so they should help pay for it (and that's going to lead to new taxes and also policies such as the Proclamation Act of 1763)
Wars were expensive - you need troops in North America so the colonists should pay their fair share
Don't forget as well that the war marks the end of salutary neglect (so that means the enforcement of the Navigation Acts and other laws the colonists were used to not abiding by)
And as a result following the war, the British are going to assume direct control over the colonies
In the minds of the colonists:

They felt they had contributed to the defense of the colonies in all four of the wars
They felt they fought bravely
And they wanted access to the new frontier land since the French are gone
And the British policies were violating their liberties
So you could see this tension starting to build up. However, it's important to note intercolonial disunity remains strong. The colonists are not calling for or even discussing independence yet, but the tensions are starting to mount.
