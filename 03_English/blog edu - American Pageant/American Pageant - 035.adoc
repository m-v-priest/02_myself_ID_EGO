What's going down 怎么回事, history people? Today we're taking a look at 审视 post-World War II America -- The Truman Administration 杜鲁门政府 and the Cold War 冷战. This is going to be a long lecture 讲座, so let's get started.

Post-war economy 战后经济: there was a concern 担忧 that the economy would collapse 崩溃 after World War II. Would there be enough jobs for the GIs 美国大兵（Government Issue 的缩写，原指美国军人的装备，后用于指代美国军人）returning from Europe in the war in the Pacific? The 15 million soldiers -- could the Great Depression 大萧条 return? And one of the things that was done in 1944: you have the GI Bill of Rights 退伍军人权利法案, also known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act 军人重新适应法案. It helped veterans 退伍军人 by providing tuition assistance 学费资助 for school and low-cost government loans 政府低息贷款 to buy homes, start businesses and other things.

Although there was this fear that possibly the economy could fall apart 崩溃, it's important to note there's an economic boom 经济繁荣 that occurs roughly from the late 1940s, 1950 onward 从那时起. In fact, you're going to have a huge economic boom. And one of the reasons is remember during World War II there was no consumer goods 消费品, so people were saving money. And as the war ends, they are now having huge purchasing power 购买力 available.

After World War II, the United States is by far the richest nation 国家 in the world, and the middle class 中产阶级 -- especially in the 1950s -- is going to grow to over 50%. Stimulating 刺激 a lot of this growth is defense spending 国防开支 as the Cold War gets heated 白热化. It's a big reason for the economic prosperity 繁荣. Not only that, but worker productivity 生产力 increases. There's an increase in people going to school. And much of this growth is going to occur in the Sun Belt 阳光地带. It's warmer there, there's lower taxes, and a lot of the defense work -- the defense jobs -- are going to take place 发生 in this Sun Belt. And then finally, in the next video, we're going to talk about the movement to the suburbs 郊区 -- Levittown 莱维敦（美国著名的郊区住宅区）and the baby boom 婴儿潮.

Now the president in 1945 when the war ends is Harry Truman 哈里·杜鲁门. And he -- remember -- was vice president 副总统 when Roosevelt dies, and he's going to have a tough time 艰难时期 politically. Couple of things about Harry Truman: Truman is a moderate Democrat 温和的民主党人 from Missouri 密苏里州, and he's going to do some things that's going to anger 激怒 those both in the Republican 共和党 and Democratic party 民主党. And really the big one is this: he is the first president in the 20th century to use the powers of the presidency 总统权力 to challenge 挑战 racial discrimination 种族歧视.

He is going to issue 发布 the Committee on Civil Rights 民权委员会 where the civil rights issues 民权问题 are investigated 调查. And most famously, he is going to issue the executive order 行政命令 which desegregates 废除种族隔离 the armed forces 武装部队. This is going to anger Southern Democrats 南方民主党人, and they're going to try to block 阻挠 other efforts that Truman tries to do in the realm of 在……领域 civil rights.

Another challenge Truman faced is Republicans who controlled Congress 国会 during this time passes the Taft-Hartley Act 塔夫脱 - 哈特利法案 over his veto 否决权. And this act really was a setback 挫折 for labor unions 工会. It made closed shops 封闭式工厂（指只雇佣工会会员的工厂）illegal 非法的. Closed shops -- if you recall -- were to hire only union employees 工会会员. This makes that illegal. And really since the Wagner Act 瓦格纳法案 during the Second New Deal 第二次新政, labor unions have been doing really well. The Taft-Hartley Act really is a setback. A big reason why it's passed is Republicans wanted to reduce the growing power of unions 削弱工会日益增长的权力.

Going into the election of 1948, the Democrats were divided 分裂. Really it was the issue of civil rights 民权问题, but also there were those in the party who thought Truman was not liberal enough 不够开明. In fact, liberal Democrats 自由派民主党人 supported Henry Wallace 亨利·华莱士 for the presidency. Southern Democrats had actually split 分裂 and supported Strom Thurmond 斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德 with the so-called Southern Democrat Dixiecrat party 所谓的南方民主党 “迪克西民主党”. And the Republican Party had their own candidate 候选人. In fact, most analysts 分析师 picked Truman to lose to the Republican candidate.

And in 1948, Truman -- you could see him there with the newspaper predicting his defeat 预测他失败 -- Truman does win reelection 连任. And with Truman's re-election, he attempts to adopt 采纳 his domestic reform program 国内改革计划 that was known as the Fair Deal 公平施政. And there's a whole bunch of things that he wants to do: he wants to extend 扩展 the programs and the progress of the New Deal 新政. So for example, extending Social Security benefits 社会保障福利, increasing the minimum wage 最低工资, national health insurance 国家医疗保险, and other issues like civil rights 民权, education funding 教育经费 and so on.

Unfortunately for Truman, not only do Southern Democrats block his proposals 提议, but also Republicans in Congress. And a lot of what he is going to try to do is not going to be accomplished 完成. The one exception was an increase in the minimum wage -- it goes from 40 cents to 75 cents an hour. But it's really domestic disputes 国内争端, but really also foreign policy 外交政策 becomes a huge priority 优先事项 for Truman. So let's take a look at that.

Like in the post-World War I period 一战后时期, the US will play a key role 发挥关键作用 in post-World War II affairs 事务. In fact, following World War II, the US is no longer isolationist 孤立主义的. One example of that is the US joins the new international organization -- the United Nations 联合国 -- in 1945. It was created during the war. Remember after World War I we reject 拒绝 the League of Nations 国际联盟 -- not this time. In fact, America will be one of the permanent UN Security Council member nations 联合国安理会常任理事国.

Another area where America plays a key role is in international finance agreements 国际金融协定 which were established at the Bretton Woods conference 布雷顿森林会议 in 1944. And they sought to 试图 establish a stable global economy 稳定的全球经济. Two things created at this conference was the International Monetary Fund 国际货币基金组织 -- the IMF -- and the World Bank 世界银行. And both of these were intended to 旨在 help rebuild the world that existed after World War II and to help promote international trade 促进国际贸易.

The Soviets 苏联人 though are going to reject these institutions 机构 because they viewed them as a tool 工具 to promote capitalism 资本主义, and they will not join either. The big thing though under Truman's Administration after World War II is the beginning of the Cold War. And the Cold War will be an ideological 意识形态的, political and -- in some instances 在某些情况下 -- military struggle 军事斗争 between the United States and the Soviet Union. It's going to last from roughly 1945 until 1991 -- until the collapse of the Soviet Union 苏联解体.

So let's take a look at some of the factors that caused this. One thing to keep in mind 记住 is that Big Three alliance 三巨头联盟 between England, the United States and the Soviet Union was a temporary halt 暂时停止 to hostility 敌对状态 which had existed even before World War II ends. In fact, even prior to 在……之前 1945, tensions 紧张局势 existed between the two sides -- the US and the Soviets.

For example, there was an ideological conflict 意识形态冲突 between capitalism and communism 共产主义. Remember we were afraid after World War I we had a Red Scare 红色恐慌 where there was fear of a communist revolution 共产主义革命. In fact, Wilson 威尔逊 supported the White Army 白军 which sought to 试图 stop the Bolshevik revolution 布尔什维克革命. Wilson fails at achieving that goal. In fact, the United States does not recognize the Soviet Union until 1933.

Stalin 斯大林 was a brutal dictator 残酷的独裁者 which made a lot of Americans not like him very much. And he also signed a non-aggression pact 互不侵犯条约 with Hitler 希特勒 in 1939 which -- for many people -- proved that this man could not be trusted. There also was tension 紧张关系 during World War II. Remember this was an alliance 联盟 that was very much an alliance of convenience 权宜之计 or necessity 必要 -- they needed each other to beat the Axis Powers 轴心国.

Some examples of tensions: remember Stalin was angry over the delays of opening the second front 第二战场 -- it would not be open until 1944. Soviets were not included in the development of the atomic bomb 原子弹 during the Manhattan Project 曼哈顿计划. And the US and the Soviets had a very different vision 愿景 for the fate of Eastern Europe 东欧的命运.

One important thing to keep in mind is what happens at the Yalta Conference 雅尔塔会议 during the war and what it means for post-war Europe 战后欧洲. The Big Three meet in Yalta in early 1945 -- Roosevelt is alive at that point -- and they discuss a couple of things. One is the post-war plan 战后计划 specifically in Eastern Europe. Both Roosevelt and Churchill think at Yalta that Stalin agrees to allow representative government 代议制政府 for elections to take place 举行选举. But you can see in that political cartoon 政治漫画 Stalin has no interest in doing that.

The other thing is Roosevelt is really desperate to 迫切希望 get Stalin to agree to help out in the war against Japan. There was a fear that the Allies 同盟国 would have to invade Japan 入侵日本 to defeat them. There was no atomic bomb ready yet, and the casualties 伤亡 on smaller islands such as Iwo Jima 硫磺岛 and Guadalcanal 瓜达尔卡纳尔岛 made Roosevelt very intent on 一心想要 getting Stalin to join the war.

When the war ends, Soviet troops 苏联军队 are occupying 占领 most of Eastern Europe, and Stalin decides that he wants to create a buffer zone 缓冲区 in that region. For Stalin, the Soviet Union had suffered nearly half the deaths of World War II -- about 20 million casualties 伤亡人员. And for him, he refuses to remove the Red Army 红军 from Eastern Europe. And rigged elections 操纵选举 brought pro-Soviet governments 亲苏政府 into power 掌权. And for the Soviet Union, these pro-Soviet puppet governments 亲苏傀儡政府 were in the name of 以……名义 preserving Soviet security 维护苏联安全.

For the United States and England, this was an attempt to spread communism 传播共产主义. And they wanted to protect and promote self-determination 自决, democracy 民主 and free trade 自由贸易 in this region. And tensions were increasing 加剧. One of the important things that you keep in mind is what happens in Europe and in particular 尤其 the policy of containment 遏制政策.

In March of 1946, the former prime minister 前首相 Winston Churchill 温斯顿·丘吉尔 gives the Iron Curtain Speech 铁幕演说 in Fulton, Missouri 密苏里州富尔顿. And he basically says that an iron curtain 铁幕 has descended 降下 across the continent 欧洲大陆. He's looking at that area in the red and said that these countries are under Soviet control 苏联控制. And he wanted -- Churchill wanted Western democratic nations 西方民主国家 -- the United States and England especially -- to join together 联合起来 to stop Soviet expansion 苏联扩张.

One month prior 之前, a guy by the name of George Kennan 乔治·凯南 develops the containment policy 遏制政策 in his Long Telegram 长电报 -- a secret document 秘密文件 -- in February of 1946. In this, the United States is encouraged to stop Soviet expansion 扩张. In fact, he calls on 呼吁 the US to adopt a policy known as containment. And that the US needs to stand up to 对抗 Soviet expansion and that they would back down 退缩. The containment policy becomes the US foreign policy 美国外交政策 through much of the Cold War, and it's super important you understand it.

So what did containment look like? Well, following World War II, both Greece 希腊 and Turkey 土耳其 were under communist pressure 共产主义压力. In Greece, there was a communist uprising 起义. And the Soviet Union was putting external pressure 外部压力 on Turkey for strategic reasons 战略原因. And so what ends up happening is Truman issues something called the Truman Doctrine 杜鲁门主义 in March of 1947. In this, he said the United States would provide military and economic aid 军事和经济援助 to help what he called the free people of Greece and Turkey from falling to the communists 落入共产主义手中.

The United States would give 400 million −− Congress authorizes 批准 this −− in order to contain the spread of communism 遏制共产主义的传播. What Greece and Turkey are not going to get are US troops 美军, but they are going to get that 400 million in aid 援助. And both countries will not fall to communist rule 共产主义统治.

Another problem for Truman to deal with is as a result of 由于 the economic hardships 经济困难 facing Europe in 1946-1947, there was a fear that communists may be voted into power 当选执政 in Western Europe -- especially places like France 法国 and Italy 意大利 which were devastated by World War II 被二战摧毁. In response 作为回应, the United States issues the European Recovery Program 欧洲复兴计划 by Secretary of State 国务卿 George Marshall 乔治·马歇尔 -- more commonly known as the Marshall Plan 马歇尔计划.

Under this plan, the US would provide billions of dollars of aid 数十亿美元的援助 to Europe. The idea behind it is we would be able to stop communism -- to contain communism -- by providing economic aid 经济援助. These countries would rebuild 重建 and prosper 繁荣, and people would not be willing to vote for the communists. Western Europe rapidly rebuilds, and communism does not spread as a result of the Marshall Plan 由于马歇尔计划. It is a huge success. And you can look at the large amounts of money given to different countries.

The Soviets were offered aid along with their Eastern satellite countries 东欧卫星国, but the Soviet Union rejects that aid 拒绝援助. The next crisis 危机 of the Cold War occurs in Germany 德国. Following World War II, Germany was divided 分裂 and controlled by the US, England, France and the Soviet Union. And that also included the capital Berlin 柏林 -- it was also divided amongst these four countries.

Stalin wanted a weak Germany following World War II and wanted them to pay reparations 赔款. And he's really -- once again -- concerned about 担忧 security, also spreading communism, and he's afraid of a reunited Germany 统一的德国 posing a threat to 对……构成威胁 the Soviet Union. He begins to form the German Democratic state 德意志民主共和国 which would be a communist puppet government 共产主义傀儡政府.

And the big moment happens in June of 1948. Stalin decides he's going to blockade Berlin 封锁柏林. Truman doesn't want to look weak or back down 退缩 in this situation. He remembers the failures of appeasement 绥靖政策 at Munich 慕尼黑. But he also knows he does not want a wider war 更大规模的战争 -- he does not want to start World War III. This is a major international crisis 重大国际危机.

Truman doesn't want to give up on 放弃 the people of Berlin, so he makes the move to 采取行动 order the Berlin Airlift 柏林空运. This provides the city of Berlin with supplies 物资 for nearly a year -- 11 months. This was a tense international situation 紧张的国际局势. Truman mobilizes 调动 bombers 轰炸机 capable of carrying atomic bombs 携带原子弹 to England. The world is very close to a potential World War III 第三次世界大战. But luckily after 11 months, Stalin ends the blockade 解除封锁 in May of 1949.

Although this crisis ends, throughout the Cold War Germany is going to remain divided 分裂 between the Federal Republic of Germany 德意志联邦共和国 -- West Germany 西德 -- and the German Democratic Republic 德意志民主共和国 -- East Germany 东德 -- run by the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, you're going to have a huge military buildup 军事集结. In fact, in 1949, the US joins its first peacetime defensive military alliance 和平时期防御性军事联盟 -- NATO 北大西洋公约组织（North Atlantic Treaty Organization 的缩写）. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was an organization of all those countries you see in green. It will continue to grow throughout the Cold War. And basically what it said is an attack on one nation is an attack on all 对一个国家的攻击就是对所有国家的攻击.

The Soviet Union later on will form its own military organization 军事组织 known as the Warsaw Pact 华沙条约组织 in the red. And in 1947, the United States will pass National Security Act 国家安全法案 which established 建立 the Department of Defense 国防部, the National Security Council 国家安全委员会 -- NSC -- and the Central Intelligence Agency 中央情报局 -- the CIA. And all of these organizations were intended to 旨在 help the US foreign policy 美国外交政策 throughout the Cold War.

There's going to be an arms race 军备竞赛 between the US and the Soviet Union as both nations try to compete militarily 军事竞争. In fact, the United States in 1949 will lose its monopoly on 失去对……的垄断 the atomic bomb when the Soviet Union detonates 引爆 its first atomic bomb. In 1950, there's a report -- a secret report -- called NSC-68 which called for 呼吁 a massive military buildup 大规模军事集结. It called on the US to rapidly increase defense spending 国防开支 to make it up to 20% of the gross national product 国民生产总值. And it called on these things so that the US would be able to deter 威慑 Soviet aggression 苏联的侵略. And those recommendations 建议 will be implemented 实施 with the Korean War which we'll discuss in just a moment.

And finally, in 1952, the US will test the first hydrogen bomb 氢弹 which was way more powerful than the bombs dropped during World War II. The Cold War is not just going to be something that happens in Europe -- it's also going to take place 发生 in Asia. In China, there was a civil war 内战 going on between the Nationalists 国民党 under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek 蒋介石 versus the Chinese Communist 中国共产党 led by Mao 毛泽东. In fact, that civil war had been going on since the 1930s. It stops when Japan attacks China during World War II.

Remember the United States had given aid to China under Lend-Lease 租借法案 as part of the allies 同盟国. And when the war ends, the civil war reemerges 重新出现. The United States provides lots of financial support 财政支持 to the nationalist forces 国民党军队 under Chiang Kai-shek. But the bad economy, his very corrupt government 腐败政府 led to a decline in Chiang's popularity 蒋介石的支持率下降. And as a result of this, you're going to have two Chinas. Because in 1949, Mao declares China to be a communist country 共产主义国家 -- the People's Republic of China 中华人民共和国 will be formed.

The United States will not formally recognize 正式承认 communist China until 1979. And it won't be until Richard Nixon 理查德·尼克松 in the early 70s that this relationship will begin to change. Chiang Kai-shek and his people flee to Taiwan or Formosa 台湾, and he claims to be the true ruler of China 中国的合法统治者. But in the end, China falls to the communists 共产党掌权. This is bad for Truman politically because Republicans blame him for losing China 指责他丢了中国. The loss of China -- in spite of the fact that this was an internal issue 内部问题 between Chinese and their own political struggles 政治斗争 -- but the US sided with the wrong side 站错队, and ultimately Truman's policies failed to contain the spread of communism 遏制共产主义的传播.

Keep in mind this happens in 1949 which is the same year the Soviets got the bomb. And so you have a growing fear in the United States about this spread of communism 共产主义的传播. In fact, in the late 1940s, you have a second Red Scare 第二次红色恐慌 occur. There is a widespread fear 普遍恐惧 of communist influence 共产主义影响 and infiltration 渗透 in American life.

Various laws were passed even before the Cold War began such as the Smith Act 史密斯法案 which made it illegal to belong to an organization that advocated the overthrow of the government by force 以武力推翻政府. The Federal Employee Loyalty Program 联邦雇员忠诚计划 was passed in 1947 which investigated the background 调查背景 of federal employees 联邦雇员. The House Un-American Activities Committee 众议院非美活动调查委员会 is restarted after World War II to search for communist influence 共产主义影响 in American life.

Many different people were called before this committee such as Hollywood actors 好莱坞演员, government officials 政府官员, and they were called before the committee to testify 作证 as to whether or not they have ever associated with any known communists 与已知的共产主义者有联系. People were blacklisted 列入黑名单, and it created a huge chilling effect 寒蝉效应 in American society. This wasn't all paranoia 偏执 -- there were some examples of spies 间谍 among us.

In fact, the most famous case is that of Alger Hiss 阿尔杰·希斯. Alger Hiss was a State Department member 国务院官员 who was accused of being a communist 被指控为共产党员 by an individual by the name of Whittaker Chambers 惠特克·钱伯斯 in 1948. Hiss was a guy who worked with the government -- he was at Yalta with Franklin Roosevelt 与富兰克林·罗斯福一同参加雅尔塔会议. He denies the charges 否认指控, but during the HUAC investigation 众议院非美活动调查委员会的调查, Congressman Richard Nixon 国会议员理查德·尼克松 makes a name for himself 在调查中成名 during the investigation. And Hiss is convicted of perjury 作伪证罪 -- of lying under oath 宣誓后作伪证 -- and he is sent to jail 入狱. This raised further questions: are there other communists within the government?

And in 1951, a couple by the name of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg 朱利叶斯和埃塞尔·罗森堡 were convicted of espionage 间谍罪 and executed 处决 in 1953. And of course, the big figure during this time is going to be Joseph McCarthy 约瑟夫·麦卡锡 which we'll talk about in the next video.

And finally, the Korean War 朝鲜战争. Korea -- remember -- was occupied by Japan during World War II. And following the war, it is divided at the 38th parallel 三八线. North of the 38th parallel, the Soviet Union would occupy 占领. And south of the 38th parallel, the US would occupy. This occupation was supposed to be temporary 临时的. And by 1949, both countries -- both the US and the Soviets -- withdrew their troops 撤军.

However, in June of 1950, North Korea shocks the world when it invades 入侵. Communist North Korea invades South Korea 韩国. In order to contain the spread of communism 遏制共产主义的传播, the US under the United Nations 联合国 comes to the defense of South Korea. Truman never gets a declaration of war 宣战 from Congress -- no war is declared. It's called a police action 警察行动. And even though it's under the UN, the US was the bulk of the troops 主力军 in this effort to contain communism.

The war goes back and forth 反复拉锯. You could see in this map right here: the invasion takes place very quickly. The communist North Koreans occupy most of South Korea. But luckily, Douglas MacArthur 道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟 lands at Inchon 仁川 and pushes the communists back across the border. However, not listening to warnings by China, China sends in huge amounts of troops 派遣大量军队 across the Yalu River 鸭绿江 and pushes the US and the United Nation troops all the way back down.

Once the Chinese and North Korean troops push the UN troops back across the 38th parallel, MacArthur called for expanding the war 扩大战争. And he criticized the limited war strategy 有限战争策略 of President Truman. He actually wanted to -- and his quote you can see there -- "There is no substitute for victory." He wanted to defeat the communists in North Korea, possibly by bombing China or even invading China 入侵中国. He wanted to widen the war 扩大战争规模. Truman wants to avoid a bigger conflict 更大的冲突 -- he wanted a limited war 有限战争 where the war was only about containing communism.

MacArthur kept questioning the president publicly 公开质疑总统. And eventually, the popular general 受欢迎的将军 is fired 被解职. And it was very controversial for Truman because of the popularity of MacArthur. But he preserves the balance of power 维护权力平衡 where the president is the commander-in-chief 总司令. Eventually, after a lot of fighting, in 1953 an armistice 停战协议 will be reached and Korea will be divided even to this day at the 38th parallel.

But the outcome 结果: containment worked 遏制政策奏效了. Truman and Eisenhower 艾森豪威尔 later on are able to keep South Korea from falling to the communists. However, some critics charged Truman of being soft on communism 对共产主义软弱 for not widening the war. But most historians agree it was the smart move 明智之举. And as I mentioned earlier, US defense spending under NSC-68 dramatically increases as a result of the Korean War.

That's going to do it. This was a super long lecture -- a lot of important stuff in here. If you have any questions, make sure you post them in the comments.

各位历史爱好者，大家好！今天我们来探讨二战后的美国——杜鲁门政府和冷战。这将是一次漫长的讲座，让我们开始吧。

战后经济：人们曾担心二战后经济会崩溃。从欧洲和太平洋战场归来的士兵是否有足够的就业机会？1500万士兵——大萧条是否会卷土重来？1944年采取的措施之一是：《退伍军人权利法案》，又称《军人调整法案》。它通过为退伍军人提供学费资助以及低息政府贷款（用于购买住房、创业等）来帮助他们。

尽管人们曾担心经济可能会崩溃，但重要的是要注意，大约从20世纪40年代末到50年代及以后，出现了一次经济繁荣。事实上，你们将看到一次巨大的经济繁荣。原因之一是，记住在二战期间没有消费品，所以人们都在存钱。战争结束后，他们现在拥有巨大的购买力。

二战后，美国是世界上最富有的国家，中产阶级——尤其是在20世纪50年代——将增长到50%以上。刺激这种增长的一个重要因素是，随着冷战的加剧，国防开支的增加。这是经济繁荣的一个重要原因。不仅如此，工人的生产力也提高了。入学人数增加了。这种增长的大部分将发生在阳光地带。那里更温暖，税收更低，许多国防工作——国防岗位——将在阳光地带进行。最后，在下一个视频中，我们将讨论向郊区的迁移——莱维敦和婴儿潮。

1945年战争结束时的总统是哈里·杜鲁门。记住，罗斯福去世时他是副总统，他将在政治上度过一段艰难的时期。关于哈里·杜鲁门的几件事：杜鲁门是密苏里州的一位温和派民主党人，他将采取一些措施，激怒共和党和民主党内的某些人。真正重要的是这一点：他是20世纪第一位利用总统权力挑战种族歧视的总统。

他将成立民权委员会，调查民权问题。最著名的是，他将发布行政命令，取消军队中的种族隔离。这将激怒南方民主党人，他们将试图阻止杜鲁门在民权领域做出的其他努力。

杜鲁门面临的另一个挑战是，在此期间控制国会的共和党人否决了他的否决，通过了《塔夫脱-哈特利法案》。这项法案实际上是对工会的一次挫折。它使“封闭式商店”成为非法。“封闭式商店”——如果你们还记得——是指只雇用工会员工的商店。这项法案使其成为非法。自从二战期间新政时期的《瓦格纳法案》以来，工会一直发展得很好。《塔夫脱-哈特利法案》确实是一次挫折。它得以通过的一个重要原因是，共和党人希望削弱工会日益增长的权力。

在1948年的总统选举中，民主党分裂了。实际上是民权问题，但党内也有人认为杜鲁门不够自由。事实上，自由派民主党人支持亨利·华莱士竞选总统。南方民主党人实际上已经分裂，支持斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德及其所谓的南方民主党“迪克西克拉特”党。共和党也有自己的候选人。事实上，大多数分析人士都认为杜鲁门会输给共和党候选人。

1948年，杜鲁门——你们可以看到他拿着预测他失败的报纸——杜鲁门确实赢得了连任。随着杜鲁门的连任，他试图推行被称为“公平施政”的国内改革计划。他想做很多事情：他想扩大新政的计划和进展。例如，扩大社会保障福利，提高最低工资，实行国民医疗保险，以及解决其他问题，如民权、教育经费等等。

不幸的是，对于杜鲁门来说，不仅南方民主党人阻止了他的提案，国会的共和党人也阻止了他的提案。他试图做的很多事情都没有实现。唯一的例外是提高了最低工资——从每小时40美分提高到75美分。但真正重要的是国内争端，而外交政策也成为杜鲁门的首要任务。所以让我们来看一下。

就像一战后时期一样，美国将在二战后事务中发挥关键作用。事实上，二战后，美国不再是孤立主义者。一个例子是，美国于1945年加入了新的国际组织——联合国。它是在战争期间创建的。记住，一战后我们拒绝了国际联盟——这次没有。事实上，美国将成为联合国安理会常任理事国之一。

美国发挥关键作用的另一个领域是1944年布雷顿森林会议上达成的国际金融协议。它们旨在建立一个稳定的全球经济。这次会议创建了两个机构：国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行。这两个机构都旨在帮助重建二战后的世界并促进国际贸易。

然而，苏联将拒绝这些机构，因为他们认为这些机构是促进资本主义的工具，他们也不会加入任何一个机构。然而，杜鲁门政府在二战后最重要的事件是冷战的开始。冷战将是美国和苏联之间的一场意识形态、政治和——在某些情况下——军事斗争。它将持续大约从1945年到1991年——直到苏联解体。

让我们看一下导致冷战的一些因素。需要记住的一点是，英国、美国和苏联之间的三大同盟只是暂时停止了甚至在二战结束之前就存在的敌对状态。事实上，早在1945年之前，美苏之间就存在紧张关系。

例如，资本主义和共产主义之间存在意识形态冲突。记住，一战后我们曾担心红色恐慌，害怕共产主义革命。事实上，威尔逊支持白军，试图阻止布尔什维克革命。威尔逊未能实现这一目标。事实上，美国直到1933年才承认苏联。

斯大林是一位残酷的独裁者，这让许多美国人非常不喜欢他。他还于1939年与希特勒签署了互不侵犯条约，这在许多人看来证明这个人不可信任。二战期间也存在紧张关系。记住，这是一种非常功利或迫不得已的联盟——他们需要彼此来击败轴心国。

一些紧张关系的例子：记住，斯大林对第二战场的延迟开放感到愤怒——直到1944年才开放。苏联没有参与曼哈顿计划期间原子弹的研发。美国和苏联对东欧的命运有着截然不同的愿景。

需要记住的一个重要问题是二战期间雅尔塔会议上发生的事情以及它对战后欧洲的意义。三大巨头于1945年初在雅尔塔会晤——当时罗斯福还活着——他们讨论了几件事。一是战后计划，特别是东欧的计划。罗斯福和丘吉尔在雅尔塔都认为斯大林同意允许举行代议制政府的选举。但你们可以在那幅政治漫画中看到，斯大林对此毫无兴趣。

另一件事是，罗斯福非常渴望让斯大林同意帮助对日作战。当时人们担心盟军必须入侵日本才能击败他们。当时还没有原子弹准备好，硫磺岛和瓜达尔卡纳尔岛等较小岛屿的伤亡使罗斯福非常希望斯大林加入战争。

战争结束后，苏联军队占领了东欧的大部分地区，斯大林决定在该地区建立一个缓冲带。对斯大林来说，苏联在二战中遭受了近一半的死亡人数——约2000万人伤亡。他拒绝将红军从东欧撤出。舞弊的选举使亲苏政府上台。对苏联来说，这些亲苏的傀儡政府是为了维护苏联的安全。

对美国和英国来说，这是企图传播共产主义。他们希望在该地区保护和促进自决、民主和自由贸易。紧张局势正在加剧。你们需要记住的一件重要事情是欧洲发生的事情，特别是遏制政策。

1946年3月，前首相温斯顿·丘吉尔在密苏里州富尔顿发表了“铁幕演说”。他基本上说，一道铁幕已经降临到欧洲大陆。他看着红色区域，说这些国家都在苏联的控制之下。丘吉尔希望西方民主国家——特别是美国和英国——联合起来阻止苏联的扩张。

一个月前，一位名叫乔治·凯南的人在他的“长电报”——一份1946年2月的秘密文件——中提出了遏制政策。在这份文件中，美国被鼓励阻止苏联的扩张。事实上，他呼吁美国采取一项被称为“遏制”的政策。美国需要顶住苏联的扩张，而苏联最终会退缩。遏制政策成为冷战时期美国外交政策的主线，理解这一点至关重要。

那么遏制政策是什么样的呢？二战后，希腊和土耳其都面临着共产主义的压力。在希腊，发生了共产主义起义。苏联出于战略原因对土耳其施加外部压力。最终的结果是，杜鲁门于1947年3月发表了“杜鲁门主义”。在其中，他说美国将向他所谓的希腊和土耳其的自由人民提供军事和经济援助，以防止他们落入共产主义之手。

美国将提供4亿美元——国会批准了这笔款项——以遏制共产主义的蔓延。希腊和土耳其不会得到美国军队，但他们将得到这4亿美元的援助。这两个国家都不会落入共产主义统治之下。

杜鲁门需要处理的另一个问题是，由于1946-1947年欧洲面临经济困难，人们担心西欧——特别是像法国和意大利这样被二战摧毁的国家——的共产党可能会通过选举上台。为了应对这种情况，美国国务卿乔治·马歇尔提出了“欧洲复兴计划”——更通俗地称为“马歇尔计划”。

根据这项计划，美国将向欧洲提供数十亿美元的援助。其背后的想法是通过提供经济援助来阻止共产主义——遏制共产主义。这些国家将重建并繁荣，人们将不愿意投票给共产党。西欧迅速重建，共产主义并没有因为马歇尔计划而蔓延。这是一个巨大的成功。你们可以看看给予不同国家的大量资金。

苏联及其东欧卫星国也获得了援助提议，但苏联拒绝了这项援助。冷战的下一个危机发生在德国。二战后，德国被美国、英国、法国和苏联瓜分和控制。这包括首都柏林——柏林也被这四个国家瓜分。

斯大林希望二战后的德国虚弱，并希望他们支付赔款。他再次非常关注安全，也希望传播共产主义，并且害怕重新统一的德国对苏联构成威胁。他开始组建德意志民主共和国，这将是一个共产主义傀儡政府。

重大事件发生在1948年6月。斯大林决定封锁柏林。杜鲁门不想在这种情况下显得软弱或退缩。他记得慕尼黑会议上绥靖政策的失败。但他知道他也不想引发更大规模的战争——他不想引发第三次世界大战。这是一场重大的国际危机。

杜鲁门不想放弃柏林人民，因此他采取行动，下令进行柏林空运。这为柏林市提供了近一年的物资——11个月。这是一个紧张的国际局势。杜鲁门调动了能够携带原子弹的轰炸机前往英国。世界非常接近潜在的第三次世界大战。但幸运的是，11个月后，斯大林于1949年5月结束了封锁。

尽管这场危机结束了，但在整个冷战时期，德国仍将分裂为德意志联邦共和国（西德）和由苏联控制的德意志民主共和国（东德）。在冷战期间，你们将看到大规模的军事集结。事实上，1949年，美国加入了其第一个和平时期的防御性军事联盟——北约。北大西洋公约组织是由你们在绿色区域看到的所有国家组成的组织。它将在整个冷战时期继续发展壮大。其基本原则是，对一个国家的攻击就是对所有国家的攻击。

苏联后来将组建自己的军事组织，称为华沙条约组织，其成员国在红色区域。1947年，美国将通过《国家安全法》，该法案设立了国防部、国家安全委员会（NSC）和中央情报局（CIA）。所有这些组织都旨在帮助美国在整个冷战时期推行其外交政策。

美国和苏联之间将展开一场军备竞赛，两国都试图在军事上竞争。事实上，1949年，当苏联引爆其第一颗原子弹时，美国将失去其在原子弹领域的垄断地位。1950年，有一份名为NSC-68的报告——一份秘密报告——呼吁进行大规模的军事集结。它呼吁美国迅速增加国防开支，使其达到国民生产总值的20%。它呼吁采取这些措施，以便美国能够威慑苏联的侵略。这些建议将在朝鲜战争中实施，我们稍后将讨论朝鲜战争。

最后，1952年，美国将试验第一颗氢弹，其威力远大于二战期间投放的炸弹。冷战不仅仅发生在欧洲——它也发生在亚洲。在中国，民族主义者蒋介石领导的军队与毛泽东领导的中国共产党之间正在进行内战。事实上，那场内战自20世纪30年代以来一直在进行。当日本在二战期间袭击中国时，内战停止了。

记住，美国曾作为盟军的一部分，根据《租借法案》向中国提供援助。战争结束后，内战重新爆发。美国向蒋介石领导的民族主义军队提供了大量财政支持。但糟糕的经济和蒋介石政府的腐败导致他的支持率下降。结果，你们将看到两个中国。因为在1949年，毛泽东宣布中国为共产主义国家——中华人民共和国成立。

美国直到1979年才正式承认共产主义中国。直到20世纪70年代初理查德·尼克松时期，这种关系才开始改变。蒋介石及其追随者逃往台湾（福尔摩沙），他声称自己是中国真正的统治者。但最终，中国落入共产党手中。这对杜鲁门在政治上是不利的，因为共和党人指责他失去了中国。中国的失守——尽管这实际上是中国人内部及其自身政治斗争的问题——但美国站错了队，最终杜鲁门的政策未能遏制共产主义的蔓延。

记住，这发生在1949年，也就是苏联获得原子弹的同一年。因此，美国国内对共产主义蔓延的恐惧日益增长。事实上，在20世纪40年代末，发生了第二次红色恐慌。人们普遍担心共产主义的影响和渗透到美国生活中。

甚至在冷战开始之前，就通过了各种法律，例如《史密斯法案》，该法案规定，属于任何鼓吹以武力推翻政府的组织都是非法的。1947年通过了《联邦雇员忠诚计划》，该计划调查联邦雇员的背景。二战后，众议院非美活动调查委员会重新启动，以搜寻共产主义在美国生活中的影响。

许多不同的人被传唤到这个委员会作证，例如好莱坞演员、政府官员，他们被传唤到委员会作证，说明他们是否曾经与任何已知的共产主义者有联系。人们被列入黑名单，这在美国社会造成了巨大的寒蝉效应。这并非完全是偏执——我们中间确实存在一些间谍的例子。

事实上，最著名的案例是阿尔杰·希斯案。阿尔杰·希斯是国务院的一名成员，1948年被一位名叫惠特克·钱伯斯的人指控为共产主义者。希斯曾在政府部门工作——他曾与富兰克林·罗斯福一起参加雅尔塔会议。他否认了这些指控，但在众议院非美活动调查委员会的调查期间，国会议员理查德·尼克松在调查中声名鹊起。希斯被判犯有伪证罪——作伪证罪——并被送进监狱。这进一步引发了疑问：政府内部是否还有其他共产主义者？

1951年，一对夫妇，朱利叶斯和埃塞尔·罗森堡，被判犯有间谍罪，并于1953年被处决。当然，这一时期的重要人物将是约瑟夫·麦卡锡，我们将在下一个视频中讨论他。

最后是朝鲜战争。记住，朝鲜在二战期间被日本占领。战后，它以北纬38度线为界分裂。38度线以北由苏联占领，38度线以南由美国占领。这种占领本应是暂时的。到1949年，美国和苏联都撤回了他们的军队。

然而，1950年6月，朝鲜入侵震惊了世界。共产主义的朝鲜入侵了韩国。为了遏制共产主义的蔓延，美国在联合国的支持下出兵保卫韩国。杜鲁门从未获得国会的宣战——没有宣战。这被称为“警察行动”。尽管是在联合国的名义下，但美国是遏制共产主义努力中的主要军事力量。

战争来回拉锯。你们可以在这张地图上看到：入侵发生得非常迅速。共产主义的朝鲜人占领了韩国的大部分地区。但幸运的是，道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟在仁川登陆，并将共产党人赶回了边境以北。然而，没有听取中国的警告，中国跨过鸭绿江派遣了大量军队，并将美国和联合国军一路推回南方。

一旦中国和朝鲜军队将联合国军推回38度线以南，麦克阿瑟就呼吁扩大战争。他批评了杜鲁门总统有限战争的战略。他实际上想——你们可以在那里看到他的引言——“胜利是无法替代的。”他想击败朝鲜的共产党人，甚至可能通过轰炸中国或入侵中国来实现。他想扩大战争。杜鲁门想避免更大的冲突——他想要一场有限的战争，战争的目的只是遏制共产主义。

麦克阿瑟继续公开质疑总统。最终，这位受欢迎的将军被解雇了。由于麦克阿瑟的受欢迎程度，这对杜鲁门来说极具争议。但他维护了总统作为三军统帅的权力平衡。最终，经过多次战斗，1953年达成了停战协议, ，朝鲜至今仍以北纬38度线为界分裂。

但结果是：遏制政策奏效了。杜鲁门和后来的艾森豪威尔成功地阻止了韩国落入共产党手中。然而，一些批评家指责杜鲁门对共产主义软弱，因为他没有扩大战争。但大多数历史学家都认为这是一个明智之举。正如我之前提到的，由于朝鲜战争，NSC-68框架下的美国国防开支大幅增加。

What's going down, history people? Today we're taking a look at post-World War II America -- The Truman Administration and the Cold War. This is going to be a long lecture, so let's get started.

Post-war economy: there was a concern that the economy would collapse after World War II. Would there be enough jobs for the GIs returning from Europe in the war in the Pacific? The 15 million soldiers -- could the Great Depression return? And one of the things that was done in 1944: you have the GI Bill of Rights, also known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act. It helped veterans by providing tuition assistance for school and low-cost government loans to buy homes, start businesses and other things.

Although there was this fear that possibly the economy could fall apart, it's important to note there's an economic boom that occurs roughly from the late 1940s, 1950 onward. In fact, you're going to have a huge economic boom. And one of the reasons is remember during World War II there was no consumer goods, so people were saving money. And as the war ends, they are now having huge purchasing power available.

After World War II, the United States is by far the richest nation in the world, and the middle class -- especially in the 1950s -- is going to grow to over 50%. Stimulating a lot of this growth is defense spending as the Cold War gets heated. It's a big reason for the economic prosperity. Not only that, but worker productivity increases. There's an increase in people going to school. And much of this growth is going to occur in the Sun Belt. It's warmer there, there's lower taxes, and a lot of the defense work -- the defense jobs -- are going to take place in this Sun Belt. And then finally, in the next video, we're going to talk about the movement to the suburbs -- Levittown and the baby boom.

Now the president in 1945 when the war ends is Harry Truman. And he -- remember -- was vice president when Roosevelt dies, and he's going to have a tough time politically. Couple of things about Harry Truman: Truman is a moderate Democrat from Missouri, and he's going to do some things that's going to anger those both in the Republican and Democratic party. And really the big one is this: he is the first president in the 20th century to use the powers of the presidency to challenge racial discrimination.

He is going to issue the Committee on Civil Rights where the civil rights issues are investigated. And most famously, he is going to issue the executive order which desegregates the armed forces. This is going to anger Southern Democrats, and they're going to try to block other efforts that Truman tries to do in the realm of civil rights.

Another challenge Truman faced is Republicans who controlled Congress during this time passes the Taft-Hartley Act over his veto. And this act really was a setback for labor unions. It made closed shops illegal. Closed shops -- if you recall -- were to hire only union employees. This makes that illegal. And really since the Wagner Act during the Second New Deal, labor unions have been doing really well. The Taft-Hartley Act really is a setback. A big reason why it's passed is Republicans wanted to reduce the growing power of unions.

Going into the election of 1948, the Democrats were divided. Really it was the issue of civil rights, but also there were those in the party who thought Truman was not liberal enough. In fact, liberal Democrats supported Henry Wallace for the presidency. Southern Democrats had actually split and supported Strom Thurmond with the so-called Southern Democrat Dixiecrat party. And the Republican Party had their own candidate. In fact, most analysts picked Truman to lose to the Republican candidate.

And in 1948, Truman -- you could see him there with the newspaper predicting his defeat -- Truman does win reelection. And with Truman's re-election, he attempts to adopt his domestic reform program that was known as the Fair Deal. And there's a whole bunch of things that he wants to do: he wants to extend the programs and the progress of the New Deal. So for example, extending Social Security benefits, increasing the minimum wage, national health insurance, and other issues like civil rights, education funding and so on.

Unfortunately for Truman, not only do Southern Democrats block his proposals, but also Republicans in Congress. And a lot of what he is going to try to do is not going to be accomplished. The one exception was an increase in the minimum wage -- it goes from 40 cents to 75 cents an hour. But it's really domestic disputes, but really also foreign policy becomes a huge priority for Truman. So let's take a look at that.

Like in the post-World War I period, the US will play a key role in post-World War II affairs. In fact, following World War II, the US is no longer isolationist. One example of that is the US joins the new international organization -- the United Nations -- in 1945. It was created during the war. Remember after World War I we reject the League of Nations -- not this time. In fact, America will be one of the permanent UN Security Council member nations.

Another area where America plays a key role is in international finance agreements which were established at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. And they sought to establish a stable global economy. Two things created at this conference was the International Monetary Fund -- the IMF -- and the World Bank. And both of these were intended to help rebuild the world that existed after World War II and to help promote international trade.

The Soviets though are going to reject these institutions because they viewed them as a tool to promote capitalism, and they will not join either. The big thing though under Truman's Administration after World War II is the beginning of the Cold War. And the Cold War will be an ideological, political and -- in some instances -- military struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. It's going to last from roughly 1945 until 1991 -- until the collapse of the Soviet Union.

So let's take a look at some of the factors that caused this. One thing to keep in mind is that Big Three alliance between England, the United States and the Soviet Union was a temporary halt to hostility which had existed even before World War II ends. In fact, even prior to 1945, tensions existed between the two sides -- the US and the Soviets.

For example, there was an ideological conflict between capitalism and communism. Remember we were afraid after World War I we had a Red Scare where there was fear of a communist revolution. In fact, Wilson supported the White Army which sought to stop the Bolshevik revolution. Wilson fails at achieving that goal. In fact, the United States does not recognize the Soviet Union until 1933.

Stalin was a brutal dictator which made a lot of Americans not like him very much. And he also signed a non-aggression pact with Hitler in 1939 which -- for many people -- proved that this man could not be trusted. There also was tension during World War II. Remember this was an alliance that was very much an alliance of convenience or necessity -- they needed each other to beat the Axis Powers.

Some examples of tensions: remember Stalin was angry over the delays of opening the second front -- it would not be open until 1944. Soviets were not included in the development of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project. And the US and the Soviets had a very different vision for the fate of Eastern Europe.

One important thing to keep in mind is what happens at the Yalta Conference during the war and what it means for post-war Europe. The Big Three meet in Yalta in early 1945 -- Roosevelt is alive at that point -- and they discuss a couple of things. One is the post-war plan specifically in Eastern Europe. Both Roosevelt and Churchill think at Yalta that Stalin agrees to allow representative government for elections to take place. But you can see in that political cartoon Stalin has no interest in doing that.

The other thing is Roosevelt is really desperate to get Stalin to agree to help out in the war against Japan. There was a fear that the Allies would have to invade Japan to defeat them. There was no atomic bomb ready yet, and the casualties on smaller islands such as Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal made Roosevelt very intent on getting Stalin to join the war.

When the war ends, Soviet troops are occupying most of Eastern Europe, and Stalin decides that he wants to create a buffer zone in that region. For Stalin, the Soviet Union had suffered nearly half the deaths of World War II -- about 20 million casualties. And for him, he refuses to remove the Red Army from Eastern Europe. And rigged elections brought pro-Soviet governments into power. And for the Soviet Union, these pro-Soviet puppet governments were in the name of preserving Soviet security.

For the United States and England, this was an attempt to spread communism. And they wanted to protect and promote self-determination, democracy and free trade in this region. And tensions were increasing. One of the important things that you keep in mind is what happens in Europe and in particular the policy of containment.

In March of 1946, the former prime minister Winston Churchill gives the Iron Curtain Speech in Fulton, Missouri. And he basically says that an iron curtain has descended across the continent. He's looking at that area in the red and said that these countries are under Soviet control. And he wanted -- Churchill wanted Western democratic nations -- the United States and England especially -- to join together to stop Soviet expansion.

One month prior, a guy by the name of George Kennan develops the containment policy in his Long Telegram -- a secret document -- in February of 1946. In this, the United States is encouraged to stop Soviet expansion. In fact, he calls on the US to adopt a policy known as containment. And that the US needs to stand up to Soviet expansion and that they would back down. The containment policy becomes the US foreign policy through much of the Cold War, and it's super important you understand it.

So what did containment look like? Well, following World War II, both Greece and Turkey were under communist pressure. In Greece, there was a communist uprising. And the Soviet Union was putting external pressure on Turkey for strategic reasons. And so what ends up happening is Truman issues something called the Truman Doctrine in March of 1947. In this, he said the United States would provide military and economic aid to help what he called the free people of Greece and Turkey from falling to the communists.

The United States would give 400 million −− Congress authorizes this −− in order to contain the spread of communism. What Greece and Turkey are not going to get are US troops,but they are going to get that 400 million in aid. And both countries will not fall to communist rule.

Another problem for Truman to deal with is as a result of the economic hardships facing Europe in 1946-1947, there was a fear that communists may be voted into power in Western Europe -- especially places like France and Italy which were devastated by World War II. In response, the United States issues the European Recovery Program by Secretary of State George Marshall -- more commonly known as the Marshall Plan.

Under this plan, the US would provide billions of dollars of aid to Europe. The idea behind it is we would be able to stop communism -- to contain communism -- by providing economic aid. These countries would rebuild and prosper, and people would not be willing to vote for the communists. Western Europe rapidly rebuilds, and communism does not spread as a result of the Marshall Plan. It is a huge success. And you can look at the large amounts of money given to different countries.

The Soviets were offered aid along with their Eastern satellite countries, but the Soviet Union rejects that aid. The next crisis of the Cold War occurs in Germany. Following World War II, Germany was divided and controlled by the US, England, France and the Soviet Union. And that also included the capital Berlin -- it was also divided amongst these four countries.

Stalin wanted a weak Germany following World War II and wanted them to pay reparations. And he's really -- once again -- concerned about security, also spreading communism, and he's afraid of a reunited Germany posing a threat to the Soviet Union. He begins to form the German Democratic state which would be a communist puppet government.

And the big moment happens in June of 1948. Stalin decides he's going to blockade Berlin. Truman doesn't want to look weak or back down in this situation. He remembers the failures of appeasement at Munich. But he also knows he does not want a wider war -- he does not want to start World War III. This is a major international crisis.

Truman doesn't want to give up on the people of Berlin, so he makes the move to order the Berlin Airlift. This provides the city of Berlin with supplies for nearly a year -- 11 months. This was a tense international situation. Truman mobilizes bombers capable of carrying atomic bombs to England. The world is very close to a potential World War III. But luckily after 11 months, Stalin ends the blockade in May of 1949.

Although this crisis ends, throughout the Cold War Germany is going to remain divided between the Federal Republic of Germany -- West Germany -- and the German Democratic Republic -- East Germany -- run by the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, you're going to have a huge military buildup. In fact, in 1949, the US joins its first peacetime defensive military alliance -- NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was an organization of all those countries you see in green. It will continue to grow throughout the Cold War. And basically what it said is an attack on one nation is an attack on all.

The Soviet Union later on will form its own military organization known as the Warsaw Pact in the red. And in 1947, the United States will pass National Security Act which established the Department of Defense, the National Security Council -- NSC -- and the Central Intelligence Agency -- the CIA. And all of these organizations were intended to help the US foreign policy throughout the Cold War.

There's going to be an arms race between the US and the Soviet Union as both nations try to compete militarily. In fact, the United States in 1949 will lose its monopoly on the atomic bomb when the Soviet Union detonates its first atomic bomb. In 1950, there's a report -- a secret report -- called NSC-68 which called for a massive military buildup. It called on the US to rapidly increase defense spending to make it up to 20% of the gross national product. And it called on these things so that the US would be able to deter Soviet aggression. And those recommendations will be implemented with the Korean War which we'll discuss in just a moment.

And finally, in 1952, the US will test the first hydrogen bomb which was way more powerful than the bombs dropped during World War II. The Cold War is not just going to be something that happens in Europe -- it's also going to take place in Asia. In China, there was a civil war going on between the Nationalists under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek versus the Chinese Communist led by Mao. In fact, that civil war had been going on since the 1930s. It stops when Japan attacks China during World War II.

Remember the United States had given aid to China under Lend-Lease as part of the allies. And when the war ends, the civil war reemerges. The United States provides lots of financial support to the nationalist forces under Chiang Kai-shek. But the bad economy, his very corrupt government led to a decline in Chiang's popularity. And as a result of this, you're going to have two Chinas. Because in 1949, Mao declares China to be a communist country -- the People's Republic of China will be formed.

The United States will not formerly recognize communist China until 1979. And it won't be until Richard Nixon in the early 70s that this relationship will begin to change. Chiang Kai-shek and his people flee to Taiwan or Formosa, and he claims to be the true ruler of China. But in the end, China falls to the communists. This is bad for Truman politically because Republicans blame him for losing China. The loss of China -- in spite of the fact that this was an internal issue between Chinese and their own political struggles -- but the US sided with the wrong side, and ultimately Truman's policies failed to contain the spread of communism.

Keep in mind this happens in 1949 which is the same year the Soviets got the bomb. And so you have a growing fear in the United States about this spread of communism. In fact, in the late 1940s, you have a second Red Scare occur. There is a widespread fear of communist influence and infiltration in American life.

Various laws were passed even before the Cold War began such as the Smith Act which made it illegal to belong to an organization that advocated the overthrow of the government by force. The Federal Employee Loyalty Program was passed in 1947 which investigated the background of federal employees. The House Un-American Activities Committee is restarted after World War II to search for communist influence in American life.

Many different people were called before this committee such as Hollywood actors, government officials, and they were called before the committee to testify as to whether or not they have ever associated with any known communists. People were blacklisted, and it created a huge chilling effect in American society. This wasn't all paranoia -- there were some examples of spies among us.

In fact, the most famous case is that of Alger Hiss. Alger Hiss was a State Department member who was accused of being a communist by an individual by the name of Whittaker Chambers in 1948. Hiss was a guy who worked with the government -- he was at Yalta with Franklin Roosevelt. He denies the charges, but during the HUAC investigation, Congressman Richard Nixon makes a name for himself during the investigation. And Hiss is convicted of perjury -- of lying under oath -- and he is sent to jail. This raised further questions: are there other communists within the government?

And in 1951, a couple by the name of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of espionage and executed in 1953. And of course, the big figure during this time is going to be Joseph McCarthy which we'll talk about in the next video.

And finally, the Korean War. Korea -- remember -- was occupied by Japan during World War II. And following the war, it is divided at the 38th parallel. North of the 38th parallel, the Soviet Union would occupy. And south of the 38th parallel, the US would occupy. This occupation was supposed to be temporary. And by 1949, both countries -- both the US and the Soviets -- withdrew their troops.

However, in June of 1950, North Korea shocks the world when it invades. Communist North Korea invades South Korea. In order to contain the spread of communism, the US under the United Nations comes to the defense of South Korea. Truman never gets a declaration of war from Congress -- no war is declared. It's called a police action. And even though it's under the UN, the US was the bulk of the troops in this effort to contain communism.

The war goes back and forth. You could see in this map right here: the invasion takes place very quickly. The communist North Koreans occupy most of South Korea. But luckily, Douglas MacArthur lands at Inchon and pushes the communists back across the border. However, not listening to warnings by China, China sends in huge amounts of troops across the Yalu River and pushes the US and the United Nation troops all the way back down.

Once the Chinese and North Korean troops push the UN troops back across the 38th parallel, MacArthur called for expanding the war. And he criticized the limited war strategy of President Truman. He actually wanted to -- and his quote you can see there -- "There is no substitute for victory." He wanted to defeat the communists in North Korea, possibly by bombing China or even invading China. He wanted to widen the war. Truman wants to avoid a bigger conflict -- he wanted a limited war where the war was only about containing communism.

MacArthur kept questioning the president publicly. And eventually, the popular general is fired. And it was very controversial for Truman because of the popularity of MacArthur. But he preserves the balance of power where the president is the commander-in-chief. Eventually, after a lot of fighting, in 1953 an armistice will be reached and Korea will be divided even to this day at the 38th parallel.

But the outcome: containment worked. Truman and Eisenhower later on are able to keep South Korea from falling to the communists. However, some critics charged Truman of being soft on communism for not widening the war. But most historians agree it was the smart move. And as I mentioned earlier, US defense spending under NSC-68 dramatically increases as a result of the Korean War.

That's going to do it. This was a super long lecture -- a lot of important stuff in here. If you have any questions, make sure you post them in the comments.
