Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're taking a look at the rise of a world power -- US imperialism 帝国主义；帝国统治, empire 帝国；帝国统治, and expansion 扩张；扩大. If you're studying for any APUSH class, if you're using those books, this video is going to help you get that five on the AP exam.

Some important ideas we need to lay out 阐述；详细说明 right away is this: since the 1790s, US territorial expansion 领土扩张 has largely focused on western expansion 西进扩张. We've been moving from the Atlantic 大西洋 to the Pacific coast 太平洋海岸, and in that we've been dealing with different countries like Mexico and Spain and England and the various Native American groups. But something changes in the 1890s. In 1893 of course Frederick Jackson Turner says the frontier 边疆；边境 has closed. The end of the Indian Wars 印第安战争 with Wounded Knee 伤膝河战役 in 1890. The 1890s marks a transition 转变；过渡 in US history -- the US becomes a global power 全球强国.

And a couple of things to keep in mind: there's a whole bunch of motives 动机；原因 for imperialism. One is economic 经济的；经济学的. There is a desire -- remember the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 is in full swing 如火如荼；全面展开 -- we want to open up markets abroad 开拓海外市场, new places to trade not just industrial goods 工业产品, manufactured goods 制成品, but also agricultural ones 农产品 as well. And US companies want access to 接近；使用；获取 cheap raw materials 廉价原材料. And you could see US exports 出口商品 going up in each decade to follow. There's also political desires 政治诉求. There's the desire to compete with other nations primarily Europe but also Japan over in Asia. We don't want to be a second-rate nation 二流国家. The countries of the world are carving up 瓜分；划分 Africa and Asia, and America wants to be a world power. And so this drives us to expansion 驱使我们扩张. We don't want to fall behind 落后.

Another motive is strategic 战略的；战略上的 or military 军事的；军队的, and that is you know we want to be able to be a military force 军事力量. We want to have naval bases 海军基地 around the world. In fact Alfred T. Mahan -- make sure you know him -- he wrote a book called The Influence of Sea Power 海权对历史的影响, and he basically talks about you need to have a powerful navy 强大的海军 if you want to be a powerful country. And this is going to be a big reason why the Panama Canal 巴拿马运河 is going to be a huge project that the US is going to participate in 参与；参加.

There are ideological motives 意识形态动机. It's not just the world of business where people are talking about ideas like social Darwinism 社会达尔文主义 and survival of the fittest 适者生存. There's this idea of The White Man's Burden 白人的负担, and people are using Charles Darwin's concepts 概念；观念 and they're applying it to international affairs 国际事务. You have the Reverend Josiah Strong who writes Our Country, and he talks about how Anglo-Saxon civilization 盎格鲁 - 撒克逊文明 is superior 优越的；优秀的 and we as Protestant Americans 美国新教徒 need to spread our values 价值观, our civilization 文明 to the rest of the world. And these ideas are going to be used to justify colonizing 殖民；开拓殖民地 other lands to spread so-called superior civilizations 所谓的优越文明.

You can see all these motives in the first case study 案例研究 which is in Hawaii 夏威夷. Hawaii was an independent land not part of the United States. And in the 1820s American missionaries 传教士 start going over there largely to convert 使转变；使皈依 the native people to Christianity 基督教. And over time American sugar and pineapple planters 种植园主 begin buying up the land 购买土地 and basically telling people that this stuff is very profitable 有利可图的 over here in Hawaii. The Dole family 多尔家族 plays a huge key role in this process around the 1860s and so on. And in 1887 the United States signs a treaty 条约 which establishes the naval base 海军基地 at Pearl Harbor 珍珠港. And there's all these different interests in the United States wanting to annex 吞并；兼并 Hawaii.

The problem is the people in Hawaii don't want to be annexed. Overwhelmingly 压倒性地；绝大多数地 this woman Queen Liliuokalani 利留卡拉尼女王 advocated 主张；提倡 that Hawaii should be controlled by the Hawaiian people. She starts speaking up 公开表达意见, and a revolt 叛乱；起义 is orchestrated 精心安排；策划 by plantation owners 种植园主 to overthrow 推翻；打倒 her in 1890s. You can see how she is portrayed 描绘；描述 in this political cartoon 政治漫画. There is a briefly an annexation controversy 吞并争议. Grover Cleveland rejects annexation 拒绝吞并 -- he wants to see if the Hawaiian people truly want this. But all that debate will come to an end when William McKinley under his administration Hawaii is annexed in 1898.

Now the big event that you should know about is the Spanish-American War 美西战争. Let me give you some background 背景情况. Cuba 古巴 was one of the few colonies 殖民地 still controlled by Spain. In fact revolts against Spanish rule 反抗西班牙统治 were becoming more and more common. People like Jose Marti 何塞·马蒂 and other Cubans wanted independence 独立, and Spain wanted to retain 保留；保持 their colony so they're sending in large numbers of troops 派遣大量军队 and they're taking some controversial steps 采取一些有争议的措施. One by the Spanish General "Butcher" Weyler 韦勒将军 -- his nickname The Butcher 屠夫 because of his policy of the reconcentration camps 集中营 where Cubans were forced into these camps and many Cubans die of starvation 饥饿 and disease 疾病.

Now you're probably wondering why does the United States care? Well the US had a large amount of investments 投资 especially in the sugar plantation industry 甘蔗种植园产业. And there is a sympathy 同情；同情心 amongst the American public for the plight 困境；苦难 of the Cuban people. And really driving that sympathy is the rise of yellow journalism 黄色新闻（指不择手段地夸张、渲染以招揽或影响读者的新闻报道） in the 1890s. Yellow journalism was practiced by people like William Randolph Hearst 威廉·伦道夫·赫斯特, Joseph Pulitzer 约瑟夫·普利策, and it was exaggerated sensationalistic reporting 夸张的耸人听闻的报道 to attract readers to their articles 吸引读者阅读他们的文章. And what you see happening in these newspapers is this kind of exaggeration 夸大；夸张 of what's happening in Cuba by Spain.

So you have all these different factors, then you get this famous moment where the Spanish minister to the United States -- the so-called de Lôme letter 德洛梅信件 -- where a Spanish official disrespects 不尊重；失礼 our president President William McKinley. An American honor 荣誉；名誉 is insulted 侮辱；冒犯. But none of that matters as much as this which happens in February of 1898. The USS Maine 缅因号 -- a US battleship 战列舰；战舰 off the coast of Cuba -- explodes 爆炸. And right away you have all sorts of fingers pointing at 指责；归咎于 Spain. The yellow press 黄色报刊 blames Spain for the destruction 破坏；毁灭 of the battleship Maine. You see this in newspaper headlines 报纸头条 and political cartoons. And in April of 1898 the United States declares war against 向……宣战 Spain. And the Spanish-American War is going to be the US, Cuba and Philippines 菲律宾 versus 对抗；与……竞争 Spain.

At the start of the war the US Congress 美国国会 passes the Teller Amendment 泰勒修正案 where the US basically declares to Cuba we have no intention of 无意；不打算 taking over 接管；控制 Cuba. They will control their own government, retain their sovereignty 主权；独立自主, and we'll see how that plays out 发展；结果如何 as the war ends. Spanish-American War was nicknamed 给……起绰号；把……叫做 by the Secretary of State 国务卿 John Hay as "The Splendid Little War" 辉煌的小战争 -- lasted four months. Only 400 Americans die during the actual fighting 实际战斗. Thousands more will die from disease 死于疾病. It does begin in the Philippines first -- another Spanish colony. George Dewey 乔治·杜威 -- American naval official 美国海军军官 -- crushes 击败；压垮 the Spanish fleet 舰队 in Manila Bay 马尼拉湾. Theodore Roosevelt 西奥多·罗斯福 resigns as assistant Secretary of the Navy 辞去海军助理部长职务, joins a group called the Rough Riders 莽骑兵（志愿骑兵部队） -- there you can see -- and the famous battle of San Juan Hill 圣胡安山战役 in Cuba -- a huge US victory. And the war ends as quickly as it starts in August of 1898 with eventually the Treaty of Paris 巴黎和约.

This treaty is very important because it's going to spark 引发；激发 a huge debate in the United States. And here's the big debate: the Treaty of Paris gives the United States Guam 关岛, Cuba, Puerto Rico 波多黎各 and the Philippines. Spain is paid $20 million. But all those areas -- those four new territories 领土；领地 -- are now under US possession 拥有；占有. And the debate is the impact of the war. The Spanish-American War is what should the US do with these newly acquired territories 新获得的领土? We have now acquired a world empire 世界帝国. There's a huge debate in Congress. You need a two-thirds majority 三分之二多数 required to ratify a treaty 批准条约, and there was a lot of people who opposed the Treaty of Paris.

There's a group called The Anti-Imperialist League 反帝国主义联盟 which opposed annexation of the Philippines and some of those other territories. But the Philippines is going to be the huge controversy 争议；争论. Membership of the Anti-Imperialist League were a diverse group of people 不同类型的人；各种各样的人. You had Andrew Carnegie 安德鲁·卡内基, head of the American Federation of Labor 美国劳工联合会主席 Samuel Gompers 塞缪尔·冈珀斯, Mark Twain 马克·吐温 and others. However the president at the time McKinley favored expansion 支持扩张, and Congress narrowly approves the treaty 勉强批准条约.

And it's important you know about what the US does in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines following the war. Let's take a look at Cuba. Remember the Teller Amendment -- we were going to leave right after the war was over. Well it is replaced by the Platt Amendment 普拉特修正案. And the Platt Amendment is passed in 1901, and you could see that in the political cartoon right there. Cuba's freedom 自由；自主 is going to be partially blocked 部分限制. Under the Platt Amendment, the US can intervene 干预；干涉 to restore peace and order 恢复和平与秩序 in Cuba whenever it feels it is necessary. Cuba was forbidden 禁止；不准 -- could not sign a treaty with a foreign power 外国势力 that limited its independence 限制其独立. And the United States would be able to maintain a naval base 维持海军基地 in Cuba at Guantanamo Bay 关塔那摩湾. So with the Platt Amendment, even though the United States officially withdraws from 撤出；退出 Cuba, Cuba remains a protectorate 保护国 of the United States. The US will be overseeing 监督；监管 Cuba, and there will be a huge amount of resentment 愤恨；不满 amongst the Cuban people.

What about Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico also had restrictions on its freedom 对其自由有限制. The act 法案 that you see right there -- Puerto Rico was granted 授予；同意给予 limited degree of popular government 有限的自治权. However it withheld 拒绝给予；保留 full self-rule 完全自治. Puerto Rico was not going to get their independence completely 完全独立. Congress does grant US citizenship 美国公民身份 to people living in Puerto Rico in 1917 -- so thank you for Ricky Martin and JLo -- but the status 状况；状态 of places such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines was still uncertain 不确定的；不明确的. And one of the key questions was did the rights and protections under the US Constitution 美国宪法 follow the US flag 跟随美国的领土扩张? Since we are controlling Puerto Rico, do they enjoy certain rights 享有某些权利 that Americans have in the United States? And in the Insular Cases 岛屿案 -- you could see JLo's reaction right there she's not too happy -- what the Supreme Court 最高法院 decides because in those cases the court says constitutional rights 宪法权利 are not automatically extended to 自动延伸至 people in American territorial possessions 美国属地. In other words 换句话说, they don't have the full rights that Americans living in the US have.

And the big one though is the Philippines. What happens in Philippines is going to be a hot mess 一团糟；混乱局面. Emilio Aguinaldo 埃米利奥·阿吉纳尔多 was the leader of the Filipino independence movement 菲律宾独立运动 against Spain. He fought alongside 与……并肩作战 the United States during the Spanish-American War, and he thought his country would receive independence 获得独立 when the war was over. In fact those thoughts of independence were crushed 粉碎；打破 because a brutal guerrilla war 残酷的游击战 takes place between the US and the Philippines. In fact that war will last 3 years, and thousands of lives will die -- many more on the Filipino side 菲律宾一方. And formal independence 正式独立 would not come to the Philippines until 1946.

One of the reasons why the United States was so interested in the Philippines was its close proximity to 靠近；接近 China. And for a very long time the US was interested in gaining access to 进入；获得使用权 the markets of China. The problem though is other nations had carved up China into what were known as spheres of influence 势力范围. And those were areas of exclusive trading privileges 专属贸易特权 -- no other nation was allowed in their particular sphere of influence. So the United States response 回应；反应 -- Secretary of State John Hay announces the Open Door Policy 门户开放政策 in 1899. And in that policy it declared 宣布；声明 that all nations should have equal trading privileges 平等的贸易特权 in China.

Now there was a lot of resentment 怨恨；不满 amongst some Chinese with all this foreign intervention 外国干涉 in their country. And in the 1890s you have an event called the Boxer Rebellion 义和团运动. And it was an attempt to remove foreign influence 消除外国影响 from China. And you get foreign offices 外国使馆 being attacked and Chinese Christian missionaries 中国基督教传教士 are killed. And eventually it is put down 镇压；平定 by an international force 国际部队 including the United States and other nations. The Boxer Rebellion is crushed 镇压；粉碎.

Brings us back to Teddy. McKinley is reelected 再次当选 in 1900. Roosevelt was added to the ticket 被列入竞选名单 -- the hero of the Spanish-American War as the vice president 副总统. And when McKinley is assassinated 暗杀；行刺 in 1901, Roosevelt becomes the president. And under Roosevelt there will be a dramatic rise 急剧上升；显著增长 in the power of the presidency 总统权力. We'll take a look at what he does as the Progressive Movement 进步运动 unfolds 展开；发展. But really in foreign policy 外交政策, Roosevelt -- TR -- is going to pursue an expansionist foreign policy 扩张主义外交政策. One of his favorite sayings was "speak softly and carry a big stick." 温言在口，大棒在手 And in essence 本质上；实质上 what this means is you're going to use diplomacy 外交；外交手段 often, but you should not back down from 退缩；放弃 using force 使用武力 if necessary and taking decisive action 采取果断行动.

And you could really see Roosevelt's approach to foreign policy 外交政策的方式 with how he gets the US rights to the Panama Canal 使美国获得巴拿马运河的权利. The presence of a canal 运河的存在 was dreamed about 向往；憧憬 for many many years because it would dramatically cut down 大幅减少；大幅缩短 the amount of time it would take to travel between different parts of the globe 全球不同地区之间的旅行时间. And this would have implications for 对……有影响；与……有关 trade but also military national security 军事国家安全 as well. France was the first country to try to formally attempt to build the canal, but ultimately 最终；最后 it fails because Panama is a tropical nation 热带国家 and diseases such as malaria 疟疾 and yellow fever 黄热病 kill thousands of workers. And Roosevelt decides when he gets into office 就职；上任 that he's going to attempt to get Colombia -- which Colombia controls Panama at this time 当时哥伦比亚控制着巴拿马 -- to allow the US to build a canal in Panama.

And ultimately Colombia rejects the treaty 拒绝该条约 that would have allowed the US to build the canal. And Roosevelt decides to take matters into his own hands 自行处理；自己解决. What he ends up doing is he decides to secretly support 秘密支持 the movement for Panamanian independence 巴拿马独立运动 from Colombia. The US would secretly back 暗中支持 Panama's independence. And of course the revolution 革命 takes place -- Panama is free. And shortly after that the United States and Panama sign a treaty which gives the US the rights to build the canal 授予美国修建运河的权利. And these actions by Roosevelt were controversial 有争议的；引起争论的, but nonetheless 尽管如此；虽然如此 the canal project begins in 1904. It does strain the relationship 使关系紧张 between the United States and Latin America 拉丁美洲. But Roosevelt is excited -- there he is checking out 查看；检查 the construction 建设；建造. There it is being built. And by 1914 -- takes a number of years -- the Panama Canal is completed 完成；竣工.

Another important thing that Roosevelt does in Latin America is the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine 罗斯福对门罗主义的推论. If you remember in 1823 Monroe Doctrine 门罗主义 basically the US says stay the heck out of 远离；不干涉 the Western Hemisphere 西半球 Europe. And the problem that was arising 出现；产生 was various Latin American countries owed money to 欠……钱 countries such as England and Germany.


England sends warships 战舰；军舰 to Venezuela 委内瑞拉 in 1902 to collect money 收取款项. Santo Domingo 圣多明各 owed money, and there's a concern 担忧；忧虑 by Roosevelt that Europe would keep intervening 持续干涉. So he responds to this perceived threat 察觉到的威胁 by issuing 发布；颁布 the Roosevelt Corollary 罗斯福推论. And in essence 本质上；实质上 he says the US has the right to intervene in 干预；干涉 Latin America 拉丁美洲. We will be the policeman of Latin America 我们将成为拉丁美洲的“警察”. We will send warships, occupy ports 占领港口 to manage collections of debt or taxes or other things 管理债务、税收或其他事务的收缴. America's got it 美国能掌控局面. And this dramatically expands 极大地扩大 US role in Latin America 美国在拉丁美洲的作用.

Various presidents such as Roosevelt, Taft 塔夫脱 and Wilson 威尔逊 will send troops 派遣军队 to such as Haiti 海地, Honduras 洪都拉斯 and the Dominican Republic 多米尼加共和国 and Nicaragua 尼加拉瓜 under the claim that we are restoring order 恢复秩序 in these countries. And of course this is going to further strain relations 进一步加剧关系紧张 between the US and Latin America but also demonstrates 显示；表明 growing US foreign presence abroad 美国在海外日益增强的影响力.

And then finally Roosevelt in East Asia you should know about 最后，关于罗斯福在东亚的情况你应该了解一下. Roosevelt wins the Nobel Prize 诺贝尔奖 for helping negotiate a peace agreement 和平协议 ending the Russian-Japanese war 日俄战争. Japan basically beats down 打败；击败 Russia, and the US is increasingly concerned over 日益担忧 the growing strength of Japan in Asia so they want that war to end. The two countries signed a Gentleman's Agreement 君子协定 in 1908. And the background is this: laws in California discriminated against 歧视 Asian immigrants 亚洲移民 -- there's that nativism 本土主义；排外主义 again. For instance 例如 San Francisco 旧金山 required Asian students to attend segregated schools 种族隔离学校. There was this fear on the west coast 西海岸 of a "Yellow Peril" 黄祸 coming and taking over the country 掌控国家. And Roosevelt and Japan reach a compromise 达成妥协 because Japan is deeply offended by 因……深感不满 these laws.

And here's what the Gentleman's Agreement covered 以下是君子协定的内容: Japan secretly agreed to restrict the immigration of 限制……的移民 Japanese workers to the US by withholding passports 扣留护照. And TR would pressure 施压 California to repeal 废除 its discriminatory laws 歧视性法律. And that's the background of the Gentleman's Agreement 这就是君子协定的背景. And then finally kind of marking 标志着 the growing role of America in the world -- Roosevelt sends the new fleet of US battleships 战列舰 -- the so-called Great White Fleet 大白舰队 -- around the world on a trip 进行环球航行. And this of course is to demonstrate 展示 the US growing power 日益增长的实力 to the rest of the world.

Key idea that you should really take away from the video 你真正应该从视频中领会到的关键要点 is the fact that McKinley 麦金利, Roosevelt -- we're going to take a look at Taft and Wilson in another video -- they all believed in playing a more active role in world affairs 国际事务. So know about the actions they took 了解他们采取的行动 and know about the differences and the similarities between their foreign policy goals 外交政策目标之间的异同.

欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们要探讨一个世界强国的崛起——美国的帝国主义、帝国和扩张。如果你正在学习任何APUSH课程，如果你正在使用这些教材，这个视频将帮助你在AP考试中拿到五分。

我们需要立即明确一些重要的观点：自1790年代以来，美国的领土扩张主要集中在西部扩张。我们一直在从大西洋向太平洋沿岸推进，在此过程中，我们与墨西哥、西班牙、英国以及各种美洲原住民群体打交道。但1890年代发生了一些变化。当然，在1893年，弗雷德里克·杰克逊·特纳说边疆已经关闭。1890年伤膝河大屠杀标志着印第安战争的结束。1890年代标志着美国历史的一个转折点——美国成为一个全球性强国。

有几件事需要记住：帝国主义有很多动机。一个是经济方面的。存在一种渴望——记住工业革命正处于蓬勃发展时期——我们希望在国外开辟市场，寻找新的贸易场所，不仅是工业品、制成品，还有农产品。美国公司想要获得廉价的原材料。你们可以看到，在接下来的每个十年里，美国的出口都在增长。还有政治方面的渴望。存在与主要为欧洲，以及亚洲的日本等其他国家竞争的愿望。我们不想成为二流国家。世界各国正在瓜分非洲和亚洲，而美国想要成为一个世界强国。因此，这驱使我们进行扩张。我们不想落后。

另一个动机是战略或军事方面的，那就是我们希望能够成为一支军事力量。我们希望在世界各地拥有海军基地。事实上，阿尔弗雷德·T·马汉——务必了解他——写了一本名为《海权论》的书，他基本上谈到，如果你想成为一个强大的国家，你必须拥有一支强大的海军。这将是美国参与巴拿马运河这个巨大项目的一个重要原因。

还有意识形态方面的动机。不仅仅是商业界人士在谈论社会达尔文主义和适者生存等思想。还有“白人的负担”这种观念，人们正在使用查尔斯·达尔文的概念，并将其应用于国际事务。约西亚·斯特朗牧师写了《我们的国家》，他谈到盎格鲁-撒克逊文明是优越的，我们作为新教徒美国人需要将我们的价值观、我们的文明传播到世界其他地方。这些思想将被用来为殖民其他土地以传播所谓的优越文明辩护。

你们可以在第一个案例研究——夏威夷——中看到所有这些动机。夏威夷是一个独立的领土，不属于美国。在1820年代，美国传教士开始前往那里，主要是为了将当地居民皈依基督教。随着时间的推移，美国的糖和菠萝种植园主开始购买土地，并基本上告诉人们，这些东西在夏威夷非常有利可图。多尔家族在1860年代左右的这个过程中发挥了巨大的关键作用。1887年，美国签署了一项条约，在珍珠港建立了海军基地。美国国内存在各种不同的利益集团想要吞并夏威夷。

问题是夏威夷人民不想被吞并。绝大多数情况下，这位莉莉乌卡拉尼女王主张夏威夷应该由夏威夷人民控制。她开始发声，种植园主在1890年代策划了一场政变来推翻她。你们可以在这幅政治漫画中看到她是如何被描绘的。曾短暂出现过一场关于吞并的争议。格罗弗·克利夫兰拒绝吞并——他想看看夏威夷人民是否真的想要这样。但所有这些辩论都将在威廉·麦金利执政期间于1898年吞并夏威夷时结束。

现在你们应该了解的重大事件是美西战争。让我给你们一些背景信息。古巴是少数几个仍然由西班牙控制的殖民地之一。事实上，反对西班牙统治的起义越来越普遍。像何塞·马蒂和其他古巴人想要独立，而西班牙想要保留他们的殖民地，所以他们派遣了大量军队，并采取了一些有争议的措施。其中之一是西班牙将军“屠夫”韦勒——他的绰号是“屠夫”，因为他推行集中营政策，古巴人被迫进入这些营地，许多古巴人死于饥饿和疾病。

现在你们可能想知道为什么美国会关心？嗯，美国在古巴有大量的投资，尤其是在甘蔗种植业。美国公众对古巴人民的困境表示同情。而真正推动这种同情的是1890年代黄色新闻的兴起。威廉·伦道夫·赫斯特、约瑟夫·普利策等人 практикуют 黄色新闻，他们通过夸大和耸人听闻的报道来吸引读者阅读他们的文章。你们在这些报纸上看到的是对西班牙在古巴所作所为的夸大描述。

所以你们有所有这些不同的因素，然后就发生了著名的“德洛梅信件”事件，西班牙驻美国大使——所谓的德洛梅——在信中不尊重我们的总统威廉·麦金利总统。美国的荣誉受到了侮辱。但所有这些都不如1898年2月发生的这件事重要。美国军舰缅因号——一艘停泊在古巴海岸的美国战舰——爆炸了。立刻，各种指责都指向了西班牙。黄色报刊指责西班牙摧毁了缅因号战舰。你们可以在报纸头条和政治漫画中看到这一点。1898年4月，美国对西班牙宣战。美西战争将是美国、古巴和菲律宾对抗西班牙。

战争开始时，美国国会通过了《泰勒修正案》，美国基本上向古巴声明我们无意占领古巴。他们将控制自己的政府，保持主权，我们将在战争结束后看到结果如何。国务卿约翰·海将美西战争戏称为“一场辉煌的小战争”——持续了四个月。实际战斗中只有400名美国人死亡。数千人死于疾病。战争首先在菲律宾爆发——另一个西班牙殖民地。美国海军军官乔治·杜威在马尼拉湾击溃了西班牙舰队。西奥多·罗斯福辞去了海军助理部长的职务，加入了一个名为“莽骑兵”的团体——你们可以在那里看到——以及在古巴著名的圣胡安山战役——美国取得了巨大的胜利。战争在1898年8月像开始时一样迅速结束，最终签订了《巴黎条约》。

这项条约非常重要，因为它将在美国国内引发一场巨大的辩论。这就是主要的辩论：巴黎条约将关岛、古巴、波多黎各和菲律宾割让给美国。西班牙获得了2000万美元的赔款。但所有这些地区——这四个新的领土——现在都处于美国的控制之下。辩论的焦点是战争的影响。美西战争之后，美国应该如何处置这些新获得的领土？我们现在已经获得了一个世界帝国。国会内部展开了激烈的辩论。批准条约需要三分之二的多数票，而很多人反对巴黎条约。

有一个名为“反帝国主义联盟”的组织，他们反对吞并菲律宾和其他一些领土。但菲律宾将成为巨大的争议焦点。反帝国主义联盟的成员来自各行各业。你们有安德鲁·卡内基、美国劳工联合会主席塞缪尔·冈珀斯、马克·吐温等人。然而，当时的总统麦金利倾向于扩张，国会以微弱优势批准了该条约。

重要的是你们要了解战争结束后美国在古巴、波多黎各和菲律宾所做的事情。让我们看看古巴。记住《泰勒修正案》——我们将在战争结束后立即离开。但它被《普拉特修正案》取代了。《普拉特修正案》于1901年通过，你们可以在那幅政治漫画中看到这一点。古巴的自由将被部分限制。根据《普拉特修正案》，美国可以在任何认为必要的时候干预古巴以恢复和平与秩序。古巴被禁止——不能与限制其独立的外国势力签署条约。美国将能够在古巴关塔那摩湾维持一个海军基地。因此，尽管美国根据《普拉特修正案》正式从古巴撤军，但古巴仍然是美国的保护国。美国将监督古巴，古巴人民将对此感到极大的不满。

波多黎各呢？波多黎各的自由也受到限制。你们在那里看到的法案——波多黎各被授予有限程度的自治政府。然而，它没有给予完全的自治权。波多黎各不会完全获得独立。国会在1917年授予居住在波多黎各的人美国公民身份——感谢瑞奇·马丁和詹妮弗·洛佩兹——但波多黎各和菲律宾等地的地位仍然不确定。关键问题之一是美国宪法下的权利和保护是否随着美国国旗而延伸？既然我们控制着波多黎各，他们是否享有美国本土美国人所拥有的一些权利？在“岛屿案件”中——你们可以看到詹妮弗·洛佩兹的反应，她不太高兴——最高法院裁定，美国宪法权利不会自动延伸到美国领土上的居民。换句话说，他们没有居住在美国本土的美国人所拥有的全部权利。

但最重要的是菲律宾。菲律宾发生的事情将是一团糟。埃米利奥·阿奎纳尔多是菲律宾反对西班牙的独立运动的领导人。他在美西战争期间与美国并肩作战，他认为战争结束后他的国家将获得独立。事实上，那些独立的想法被粉碎了，因为美国和菲律宾之间爆发了一场残酷的游击战。事实上，这场战争持续了三年，数千人丧生——菲律宾方面更多。直到1946年，菲律宾才获得正式独立。

美国如此关注菲律宾的原因之一是它靠近中国。长期以来，美国一直对进入中国市场感兴趣。然而，问题是其他国家已经将中国瓜分为所谓的势力范围。这些是独家贸易特权的区域——其他国家不允许进入其特定的势力范围。因此，美国的回应——国务卿约翰·海于1899年宣布了门户开放政策。该政策声明所有国家在中国应享有平等的贸易特权。

当时一些中国人对所有这些外国干涉他们的国家感到非常不满。在1890年代，发生了一件叫做义和团运动的事件。这是试图清除中国境内外国势力的行动。你们看到外国办事处遭到袭击，中国基督教传教士被杀害。最终，包括美国和其他国家在内的国际部队镇压了这场运动。义和团运动被镇压了。

这又把我们带回了泰迪。麦金利在1900年再次当选。罗斯福作为美西战争的英雄被列入竞选名单担任副总统。1901年麦金利遇刺后，罗斯福成为总统。在罗斯福的领导下，总统的权力将急剧上升。我们将看看他在进步运动展开时所做的事情。但实际上在外交政策方面，罗斯福——TR——将奉行扩张主义的外交政策。他最喜欢的一句话是“温言在口，大棒在手”。本质上，这意味着你经常使用外交手段，但如果必要并且需要采取果断行动时，你不应该退缩使用武力。

你们可以真正看到罗斯福处理外交政策的方式，就像他如何获得美国在巴拿马运河的权利一样。运河的存在被人们梦想了很多很多年，因为它将大大缩短全球不同地区之间的旅行时间。这将对贸易以及军事国家安全产生影响。法国是第一个正式尝试修建运河的国家，但最终失败了，因为巴拿马是一个热带国家，疟疾和黄热病等疾病夺去了数千名工人的生命。罗斯福上任后决定，他将尝试让哥伦比亚——当时哥伦比亚控制着巴拿马——允许美国在巴拿马修建运河。

最终，哥伦比亚拒绝了允许美国修建运河的条约。罗斯福决定采取行动。他最终决定秘密支持巴拿马从哥伦比亚独立的运动。美国将秘密支持巴拿马的独立。当然，革命发生了——巴拿马自由了。此后不久，美国和巴拿马签署了一项条约，该条约赋予美国修建运河的权利。罗斯福的这些行动引起了争议，但无论如何，运河项目于1904年开始。这确实损害了美国和拉丁美洲之间的关系。但罗斯福很兴奋——他在那里视察建设。运河正在建设中。到1914年——经过数年——巴拿马运河竣工了。

罗斯福在拉丁美洲做的另一件重要的事情是“罗斯福推论”对“门罗主义”的补充。如果你们还记得，在1823年，“门罗主义”基本上是美国告诉欧洲不要插手西半球。当时出现的问题是，一些拉丁美洲国家欠英国和德国等国家的钱。1902年，英国派遣军舰前往委内瑞拉收债。圣多明各也欠钱，罗斯福担心欧洲会继续干预。因此，他通过发布“罗斯福推论”来回应这种他认为的威胁。本质上，他说美国有权干预拉丁美洲。我们将成为拉丁美洲的警察。我们将派遣军舰，占领港口以管理债务或税收或其他事宜的收取。美国会处理好。这极大地扩大了美国在拉丁美洲的作用。

罗斯福、塔夫脱和威尔逊等几位总统以我们在这些国家恢复秩序为由，向海地、洪都拉斯、多米尼加共和国和尼加拉瓜等地派遣军队。当然，这将进一步加剧美国与拉丁美洲之间的关系，但也表明美国在海外的影响力日益增强。

最后，关于罗斯福在东亚的政策，你们应该了解一下。罗斯福因帮助谈判结束日俄战争的和平协议而获得了诺贝尔和平奖。日本基本上击败了俄罗斯，美国越来越担心日本在亚洲日益增长的实力，因此他们希望结束这场战争。两国于1908年签署了《绅士协定》。背景是：加利福尼亚州的法律歧视亚洲移民——本土主义再次出现。例如，旧金山要求亚洲学生就读隔离学校。西海岸担心“黄祸”来临并控制这个国家。罗斯福和日本达成了妥协，因为日本对这些法律深感不满。

以下是《绅士协定》的内容：日本秘密同意通过扣留护照来限制日本工人移民美国。而罗斯福将向加利福尼亚州施压，要求其废除歧视性法律。这就是《绅士协定》的背景。最后，为了标志美国在世界舞台上日益增长的作用——罗斯福派遣美国新型战舰舰队——所谓的“大白舰队”——进行环球航行。当然，这是为了向世界其他国家展示美国日益增长的实力。

你们真正应该从视频中记住的关键思想是，麦金利和罗斯福——我们将在另一段视频中讨论塔夫脱和威尔逊——他们都相信在世界事务中发挥更积极的作用。所以要了解他们采取的行动，并了解他们外交政策目标之间的异同。

Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're taking a look at the rise of a world power -- US imperialism, empire and expansion. If you're studying for any APUSH class, if you're using those books, this video is going to help you get that five on the AP exam.

Some important ideas we need to lay out right away is this: since the 1790s, US territorial expansion has largely focused on western expansion. We've been moving from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, and in that we've been dealing with different countries like Mexico and Spain and England and the various Native American groups. But something changes in the 1890s. In 1893 of course Frederick Jackson Turner says the frontier has closed. The end of the Indian Wars with Wounded Knee in 1890. The 1890s marks a transition in US history -- the US becomes a global power.

And a couple of things to keep in mind: there's a whole bunch of motives for imperialism. One is economic. There is a desire -- remember the Industrial Revolution is in full swing -- we want to open up markets abroad, new places to trade not just industrial goods, manufactured goods, but also agricultural ones as well. And US companies want access to cheap raw materials. And you could see US exports going up in each decade to follow. There's also political desires. There's the desire to compete with other nations primarily Europe but also Japan over in Asia. We don't want to be a second-rate nation. The countries of the world are carving up Africa and Asia, and America wants to be a world power. And so this drives us to expansion. We don't want to fall behind.

Another motive is strategic or military, and that is you know we want to be able to be a military force. We want to have naval bases around the world. In fact Alfred T. Mahan -- make sure you know him -- he wrote a book called The Influence of Sea Power, and he basically talks about you need to have a powerful navy if you want to be a powerful country. And this is going to be a big reason why the Panama Canal is going to be a huge project that the US is going to participate in.

There are ideological motives. It's not just the world of business where people are talking about ideas like social Darwinism and survival of the fittest. There's this idea of The White Man's Burden, and people are using Charles Darwin's concepts and they're applying it to international affairs. You have the Reverend Josiah Strong who writes Our Country, and he talks about how Anglo-Saxon civilization is superior and we as Protestant Americans need to spread our values, our civilization to the rest of the world. And these ideas are going to be used to justify colonizing other lands to spread so-called superior civilizations.

You can see all these motives in the first case study which is in Hawaii. Hawaii was an independent land not part of the United States. And in the 1820s American missionaries start going over there largely to convert the native people to Christianity. And over time American sugar and pineapple planters begin buying up the land and basically telling people that this stuff is very profitable over here in Hawaii. The Dole family plays a huge key role in this process around the 1860s and so on. And in 1887 the United States signs a treaty which establishes the naval base at Pearl Harbor. And there's all these different interests in the United States wanting to annex Hawaii.

The problem is the people in Hawaii don't want to be annexed. Overwhelmingly this woman Queen Liliuokalani advocated that Hawaii should be controlled by the Hawaiian people. She starts speaking up, and a revolt is orchestrated by plantation owners to overthrow her in 1890s. You can see how she is portrayed in this political cartoon. There is a briefly an annexation controversy. Grover Cleveland rejects annexation -- he wants to see if the Hawaiian people truly want this. But all that debate will come to an end when William McKinley under his administration Hawaii is annexed in 1898.

Now the big event that you should know about is the Spanish-American War. Let me give you some background. Cuba was one of the few colonies still controlled by Spain. In fact revolts against Spanish rule were becoming more and more common. People like Jose Marti and other Cubans wanted independence, and Spain wanted to retain their colony so they're sending in large numbers of troops and they're taking some controversial steps. One by the Spanish General "Butcher" Weyler -- his nickname The Butcher because of his policy of the reconcentration camps where Cubans were forced into these camps and many Cubans die of starvation and disease.

Now you're probably wondering why does the United States care? Well the US had a large amount of investments especially in the sugar plantation industry. And there is a sympathy amongst the American public for the plight of the Cuban people. And really driving that sympathy is the rise of yellow journalism in the 1890s. Yellow journalism was practiced by people like William Randolph Hearst, Joseph Pulitzer, and it was exaggerated sensationalistic reporting to attract readers to their articles. And what you see happening in these newspapers is this kind of exaggeration of what's happening in Cuba by Spain.

So you have all these different factors, then you get this famous moment where the Spanish minister to the United States -- the so-called de Lôme letter -- where a Spanish official disrespects our president President William McKinley. An American honor is insulted. But none of that matters as much as this which happens in February of 1898. The USS Maine -- a US battleship off the coast of Cuba -- explodes. And right away you have all sorts of fingers pointing at Spain. The yellow press blames Spain for the destruction of the battleship Maine. You see this in newspaper headlines and political cartoons. And in April of 1898 the United States declares war against Spain. And the Spanish-American War is going to be the US, Cuba and Philippines versus Spain.

At the start of the war the US Congress passes the Teller Amendment where the US basically declares to Cuba we have no intention of taking over Cuba. They will control their own government, retain their sovereignty, and we'll see how that plays out as the war ends. Spanish-American War was nicknamed by the Secretary of State John Hay as "The Splendid Little War" -- lasted four months. Only 400 Americans die during the actual fighting. Thousands more will die from disease. It does begin in the Philippines first -- another Spanish colony. George Dewey -- American naval official -- crushes the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. Theodore Roosevelt resigns as assistant Secretary of the Navy, joins a group called the Rough Riders -- there you can see -- and the famous battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba -- a huge US victory. And the war ends as quickly as it starts in August of 1898 with eventually the Treaty of Paris.

This treaty is very important because it's going to spark a huge debate in the United States. And here's the big debate: the Treaty of Paris gives the United States Guam, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Spain is paid $20 million. But all those areas -- those four new territories -- are now under US possession. And the debate is the impact of the war. The Spanish-American War is what should the US do with these newly acquired territories? We have now acquired a world empire. There's a huge debate in Congress. You need a two-thirds majority required to ratify a treaty, and there was a lot of people who opposed the Treaty of Paris.

There's a group called The Anti-Imperialist League which opposed annexation of the Philippines and some of those other territories. But the Philippines is going to be the huge controversy. Membership of the Anti-Imperialist League were a diverse group of people. You had Andrew Carnegie, head of the American Federation of Labor Samuel Gompers, Mark Twain and others. However the president at the time McKinley favored expansion, and Congress narrowly approves the treaty.

And it's important you know about what the US does in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines following the war. Let's take a look at Cuba. Remember the Teller Amendment -- we were going to leave right after the war was over. Well it is replaced by the Platt Amendment. And the Platt Amendment is passed in 1901, and you could see that in the political cartoon right there. Cuba's freedom is going to be partially blocked. Under the Platt Amendment, the US can intervene to restore peace and order in Cuba whenever it feels it is necessary. Cuba was forbidden -- could not sign a treaty with a foreign power that limited its independence. And the United States would be able to maintain a naval base in Cuba at Guantanamo Bay. So with the Platt Amendment, even though the United States officially withdraws from Cuba, Cuba remains a protectorate of the United States. The US will be overseeing Cuba, and there will be a huge amount of resentment amongst the Cuban people.

What about Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico also had restrictions on its freedom. The act that you see right there -- Puerto Rico was granted limited degree of popular government. However it withheld full self-rule. Puerto Rico was not going to get their independence completely. Congress does grant US citizenship to people living in Puerto Rico in 1917 -- so thank you for Ricky Martin and JLo -- but the status of places such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines was still uncertain. And one of the key questions was did the rights and protections under the US Constitution follow the US flag? Since we are controlling Puerto Rico, do they enjoy certain rights that Americans have in the United States? And in the Insular Cases -- you could see JLo's reaction right there she's not too happy -- what the Supreme Court decides because in those cases the court says constitutional rights are not automatically extended to people in American territorial possessions. In other words, they don't have the full rights that Americans living in the US have.

And the big one though is the Philippines. What happens in Philippines is going to be a hot mess. Emilio Aguinaldo was the leader of the Filipino independence movement against Spain. He fought alongside the United States during the Spanish-American War, and he thought his country would receive independence when the war was over. In fact those thoughts of independence were crushed because a brutal guerrilla war takes place between the US and the Philippines. In fact that war will last 3 years, and thousands of lives will die -- many more on the Filipino side. And formal independence would not come to the Philippines until 1946.

One of the reasons why the United States was so interested in the Philippines was its close proximity to China. And for a very long time the US was interested in gaining access to the markets of China. The problem though is other nations had carved up China into what were known as spheres of influence. And those were areas of exclusive trading privileges -- no other nation was allowed in their particular sphere of influence. So the United States response -- Secretary of State John Hay announces the Open Door Policy in 1899. And in that policy it declared that all nations should have equal trading privileges in China.

Now there was a lot of resentment amongst some Chinese with all this foreign intervention in their country. And in the 1890s you have an event called the Boxer Rebellion. And it was an attempt to remove foreign influence from China. And you get foreign offices being attacked and Chinese Christian missionaries are killed. And eventually it is put down by an international force including the United States and other nations. The Boxer Rebellion is crushed.

Brings us back to Teddy. McKinley is reelected in 1900. Roosevelt was added to the ticket -- the hero of the Spanish-American War as the vice president. And when McKinley is assassinated in 1901, Roosevelt becomes the president. And under Roosevelt there will be a dramatic rise in the power of the presidency. We'll take a look at what he does as the Progressive Movement unfolds. But really in foreign policy, Roosevelt -- TR -- is going to pursue an expansionist foreign policy. One of his favorite sayings was "speak softly and carry a big stick." And in essence what this means is you're going to use diplomacy often, but you should not back down from using force if necessary and taking decisive action.

And you could really see Roosevelt's approach to foreign policy with how he gets the US rights to the Panama Canal. The presence of a canal was dreamed about for many many years because it would dramatically cut down the amount of time it would take to travel between different parts of the globe. And this would have implications for trade but also military national security as well. France was the first country to try to formally attempt to build the canal, but ultimately it fails because Panama is a tropical nation and diseases such as malaria and yellow fever kill thousands of workers. And Roosevelt decides when he gets into office that he's going to attempt to get Colombia -- which Colombia controls Panama at this time -- to allow the US to build a canal in Panama.

And ultimately Colombia rejects the treaty that would have allowed the US to build the canal. And Roosevelt decides to take matters into his own hands. What he ends up doing is he decides to secretly support the movement for Panamanian independence from Colombia. The US would secretly back Panama's independence. And of course the revolution takes place -- Panama is free. And shortly after that the United States and Panama sign a treaty which gives the US the rights to build the canal. And these actions by Roosevelt were controversial, but nonetheless the canal project begins in 1904. It does strain the relationship between the United States and Latin America. But Roosevelt is excited -- there he is checking out the construction. There it is being built. And by 1914 -- takes a number of years -- the Panama Canal is completed.

Another important thing that Roosevelt does in Latin America is the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. If you remember in 1823 Monroe Doctrine basically the US says stay the heck out of the Western Hemisphere Europe. And the problem that was arising was various Latin American countries owed money to countries such as England and Germany. England sends warships to Venezuela in 1902 to collect money. Santo Domingo owed money, and there's a concern by Roosevelt that Europe would keep intervening. So he responds to this perceived threat by issuing the Roosevelt Corollary. And in essence he says the US has the right to intervene in Latin America. We will be the policeman of Latin America. We will send warships, occupy ports to manage collections of debt or taxes or other things. America's got it. And this dramatically expands US role in Latin America.

Various presidents such as Roosevelt, Taft and Wilson will send troops to such as Haiti, Honduras and the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua under the claim that we are restoring order in these countries. And of course this is going to further strain relations between the US and Latin America but also demonstrates growing US foreign presence abroad.

And then finally Roosevelt in East Asia you should know about. Roosevelt wins the Nobel Prize for helping negotiate a peace agreement ending the Russian-Japanese war. Japan basically beats down Russia, and the US is increasingly concerned over the growing strength of Japan in Asia so they want that war to end. The two countries signed a Gentleman's Agreement in 1908. And the background is this: laws in California discriminated against Asian immigrants -- there's that nativism again. For instance San Francisco required Asian students to attend segregated schools. There was this fear on the west coast of a "Yellow Peril" coming and taking over the country. And Roosevelt and Japan reach a compromise because Japan is deeply offended by these laws.

And here's what the Gentleman's Agreement covered: Japan secretly agreed to restrict the immigration of Japanese workers to the US by withholding passports. And TR would pressure California to repeal its discriminatory laws. And that's the background of the Gentleman's Agreement. And then finally kind of marking the growing role of America in the world -- Roosevelt sends the new fleet of US battleships -- the so-called Great White Fleet -- around the world on a trip. And this of course is to demonstrate the US growing power to the rest of the world.

Key idea that you should really take away from the video is the fact that McKinley, Roosevelt -- we're going to take a look at Taft and Wilson in another video -- they all believed in playing a more active role in world affairs. So know about the actions they took and know about the differences and the similarities between their foreign policy goals.

That's going to do it for today. If the video helped you out, do me a favor and click like. If you haven't done so, subscribe to the channel. Tell all your APUSH homies and homegirls to do the same. And if you have any questions, post them in the comments -- I'll be quick to respond. Have a beautiful day. Peace.
