What's up, people? 怎么了，各位？Today we're taking a look at APUSH period 8 -- 1945, the end of World War II, all the way up until 1980, the election of Ronald Reagan. On the exam, this period is about 15% of the APUSH test, so let's get started.

Some change in continuity post-World War II. It's important to keep in mind that unlike in the post-World War I period, the U.S. will play a key role in post-World War II affairs. Let me give you an example -- U.S. does not join the League of Nations following World War I. Remember Wilson's plan is rejected by the Senate. But the U.S. will join the new international organization 国际组织, the United Nations (the UN), in 1945. There will be some similarities -- remember Wilson with his 14 points -- well, a lot of those similar ideas are going to be found in the document signed by Roosevelt and Churchill called the Atlantic Charter 大西洋宪章.

Most important thing in post-World War II is the Cold War 冷战 is going to begin. It will be an ideological 意识形态的, political and military struggle 斗争 between the two superpowers 超级大国 -- the United States and the Soviet Union -- and this thing is going to last from around 1946 to 1991, the fall of the Soviet Union. Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. is going to pursue a policy called containment 遏制政策. It's going to be articulated 阐述 by George Kennan, and the U.S. is going to pursue a variety of methods and ways to try to contain communism 共产主义. Most of the time this is going to be done with indirect military conflict 冲突 and support. Very often you're going to see during this time the U.S. pledging 承诺 military and financial assistance 援助 to countries trying to resist perceived or real communist aggression 侵略.

So for example, you get the Truman Doctrine 杜鲁门主义 where we give $400 million to Greece and Turkey to keep them from falling to the communists. We are successful in both countries. Marshall Plan 马歇尔计划 is established under the Truman Administration -- we give billions of dollars of money to Western Europe to rebuild countries, especially France and Italy, so that in the elections people won't be inclined to 倾向于 vote for the communists. That is a huge success as well. During the Chinese Civil War, the U.S. is going to give a lot of money to the nationalists 国民党 under Chiang Kai-shek. However, that is not going to be a successful policy because in 1949, Mao the communist declares the People's Republic of China.

The U.S. is going to pursue all sorts of collective security agreements 集体安全协议. We've already mentioned the United Nations, but we're also going to join the first permanent peacetime military alliance 军事同盟 -- kind of forgetting the warnings of George Washington's Farewell Address 告别演说 -- when we sign up and join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 北大西洋公约组织. And basically what this military alliance said was if there was an attack on one member, it was considered an attack on all. The U.S. is also going to be involved in indirect military conflict with its use of the CIA, especially starting with Dwight Eisenhower's Administration, where the CIA is going to try to get rid of regimes 政权 in Guatemala and Iran.

And then finally, as time goes on, the U.S. is going to find itself overcommitted 过度投入 around the world, and under President Nixon you're going to have the Nixon Doctrine 尼克松主义 where we're basically going to say to Vietnam and other countries -- you are going to have to do your own fighting. The U.S. will provide you with money and military equipment but not U.S. soldiers. At all times this is going to be known as the policy of Vietnamization 越南化 in Vietnam.

There's also going to be military buildup 军事集结 throughout the Cold War. It's one of the key parts of trying to contain communism, and you are going to have an arms race 军备竞赛 throughout the Cold War. This can really be seen in Truman building up the military during the Korean War under the recommendations of NSC-68. Under Eisenhower, you have the New Look policy 新面貌政策 where there's this stress and reliance on 依赖 nuclear weapons -- "more bang for the buck" was the idea. And really key to this is this idea of massive retaliation 大规模报复 -- that we will deter 威慑 the Soviets by building up our nuclear arsenal 核武库. They will be reluctant to 不情愿 make moves 'cause they know we're going to blow them up. Kennedy is going to alter 改变 his foreign policy military spending with something called flexible response 灵活反应 -- having a variety of options available because you can't use nukes in all situations.

Another part of the Cold War is going to be the Space Race 太空竞赛. You're going to see this where especially after Sputnik 人造卫星 in 1957, we feel like we're falling behind the Soviet Union. So you have this mass funding for not only NASA but also education with the National Defense Education Act 国防教育法. And of course, remember Kennedy with this famous speech says we are going to put a man on the moon, and this will happen in 1969 when the U.S. becomes the first country to put a man on the moon.

Now over in that direct military column, there is going to be moments where the U.S. is going to use direct military force 军事力量 to stop communism. Most famously in Korea -- started in 1950 when North Korea invades 入侵 South Korea crossing the 38th parallel. This is a limited war 有限战争 -- meaning the war is only meant to stop communism from South Korea. There's a debate during the war about this strategy, but ultimately containment is achieved by Truman and then Eisenhower. And then of course the big one is going to be the Vietnam War, where really after the Gulf of Tonkin resolution 东京湾决议 -- where we were allegedly 据称 attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin -- President Lyndon Johnson escalates 升级 American involvement. We start Operation Rolling Thunder where we're bombing North Vietnam. And after 3 years of fighting, we're being told the American people are near victory. However, the Tet Offensive 春节攻势 in 1968 really proves otherwise, and the war increasingly becomes controversial 有争议的. All of these are examples of ways the U.S. sought to contain or threaten communism during the Cold War.

It's important to keep in mind throughout the Cold War that there were periods of détente 缓和 -- or relaxation of tensions 紧张局势. There were thaws 解冻 in the Cold War, and you could see this periods of mutual coexistence 共存. Really kind of the first thaw of the Cold War can be seen under Eisenhower where Ike calls for a relaxation of tensions and a reduction in the arms race with the Soviet counterpart Nikita Khrushchev. They have the "Atoms for Peace" plan proposed. In fact in 1955, they meet -- Eisenhower meets with Soviet leaders -- and you get the Geneva Conference 日内瓦会议, and many start to talk about the "spirit of Geneva" between these two superpowers. However, this period of coexistence is going to be ruined by the shooting down of the U-2 spy plane incident. But once again, following the Cuban Missile Crisis 古巴导弹危机 where the two superpowers were close to war in 1962, a direct hotline 热线 was installed between Washington D.C. and Moscow.

Perhaps the period of détente that you should most be familiar with is under Nixon and his foreign policy adviser Kissinger. And Nixon's really going to seek to take advantage of the distrust and rivalry 竞争 between China and the Soviet Union -- this so-called Sino-Soviet split 中苏分裂. And he's going to do so when he visits China -- the first U.S. president to do so -- in February of 1972 to meet with Mao. Shortly after that, he helps negotiate the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) 战略武器限制谈判 which was designed to limit nuclear weapons. However, further talks are going to be ruined -- SALT II will be ruined when the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan in 1979. But keep in mind the Cold War is going to fluctuate 波动 between these periods of direct conflict, indirect conflict and periods of détente.

Another important thing to understand about period 8 is how Cold War policies led to debate over the power of the federal government, acceptable ways of pursuing international and domestic goals, and the proper balance between liberty 自由 and order 秩序. And some examples of these themes can be seen in the debate -- especially the growing debate over the presence of a growing nuclear arsenal. Eisenhower warned the nation in his farewell address about the military-industrial complex 军事工业复合体 and how the growing arms race was a threat to American domestic life. You are going to see various arms control agreements -- the most famous one of course probably being the SALT agreement, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. But you're also going to see this debate over the power of the executive branch 行政部门 and the growing power of the presidency 总统职权.

There was a dispute 争议 between Truman and his general Douglas MacArthur -- MacArthur is fired for criticizing Truman's handling of the war, the limited war strategy. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution in 1964 gives President Johnson a blank check 全权委托, and many people see this as an excessive 过度的 amount of presidential power that widens the Vietnam War. And in 1973, you're going to have the War Powers Act 战争权力法案 which is designed to limit presidential war-making power.

Throughout the Cold War, you're going to see domestic opposition 国内反对 to Cold War policies. There was limited debate over the Korean War -- some people debated the merits 优点 of a limited war, especially Republicans who criticized Truman's handling of the war. They saw him as being too weak. And the big moment though in domestic opposition is going to be with Vietnam. The Vietnam War bitterly divided the nation between hawks 鹰派 -- those people who were for the war -- and doves 鸽派 -- those who were against the war. And really events like the Tet Offensive in 1968 and the bombing of Cambodia escalate 加剧 and increase the anti-war movement. In fact, the news of the bombing of Cambodia during Nixon's presidency led to the Kent State protest 肯特州立大学抗议 which led to the deaths of four college students. And college campus protests spread throughout the country.

And as a result of the Cold War, you are going to have this impacting domestic life. The challenge arose over the effort to balance civil liberties 公民自由 with order and security. One of the key things that happens in the late 40s and 50s is a widespread fear of communist influence and infiltration 渗透 in American life. Revelations 揭露 of people like Alger Hiss and the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's revelations of spy rings 间谍网 in America causes widespread fear. This leads to the rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism 麦卡锡主义 -- this accusing of people with little or no evidence. And in the late 40s, early 50s, you have a second Red Scare 红色恐慌. In fact even before this time, you have the Federal Employee Loyalty Program 联邦雇员忠诚计划 which investigated the background of federal employees within the government, and many people lost their jobs. In fact, you have the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) 众议院非美活动调查委员会 which is restarted after World War II, and it is designed to root out 根除 and search for communist influence in American life. Very often people were brought before the committee and forced to name names -- for example, you have the Hollywood Ten brought before the committee.

In spite of this, criticisms over these policies, it's important to note both Republicans and Democrats supported the policy of containing communism. However, there were disputes at the methods and ways to do this.

A really important idea to keep in mind is post-World War II decolonization 非殖民化, and you have the collapse of colonial empires 殖民帝国 leading both the U.S. and the Soviet Union competing for influence in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. You're going to see this in Vietnam as Ho Chi Minh is trying to get rid of the French following World War II. And you're going to see that these areas of the world that were former colonies are going to be the target of both U.S. and Soviet foreign policy.

Some examples of this you can be seen in the Middle East. The U.S. had a variety of interests -- ideologically we had support for Israel immediately following World War II, but also any regime that was non-communist. Economic concerns -- access to oil -- as well as military strategic concerns. Some examples of U.S. policy and how it was impacted by the Cold War could be seen in Operation Ajax -- President Eisenhower in 1953 used the CIA to help overthrow 推翻 the democratically elected Iranian government. This causes all sorts of problems. And in the Suez Crisis 苏伊士运河危机 -- President Nasser of Egypt, he is a nationalist 民族主义者, he nationalizes 国有化 the Suez Canal, and as a result England, France and Israel -- without consulting the United States -- attacks Egypt. This causes a huge crisis and eventually Eisenhower has to intervene 干预 to end the war, and prompts Eisenhower to issue the Eisenhower Doctrine 艾森豪威尔主义 which basically stated the U.S. promised economic military aid to any Middle Eastern country threatened by communist aggression.

In 1960, you get the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 石油输出国组织 formed which is designed to control the oil supply and trade. This is going to have a huge impact on U.S. energy policy. And during the Yom Kippur War 赎罪日战争 during Nixon's Administration, Egypt and Syria suddenly attacked Israel, and the U.S. provides aid to Israel in the form of economic and military support. This contributes to an oil embargo 石油禁运 it's imposed on the United States by the oil-rich nations in OPEC. And finally another thing to keep in mind with regard to the Middle East -- the Camp David Accords 戴维营协议 in 1978. President Jimmy Carter helps negotiate a deal in which Israel and Egypt sign a peace agreement.

The U.S. is also heavily going to be involved in Latin America. And in Latin America, the U.S. supported non-communist regimes with varying levels of democracy. In fact in 1954, the CIA under President Eisenhower is going to overthrow the democratically elected Árbenz government. They will do so because the government is going to nationalize land held by the United Fruit Company, and the CIA is going to help bring into power a very undemocratic government but pro-U.S. government in Guatemala.

There's going to be a crisis in 1959 when in Cuba, Fidel Castro led a revolution 革命 that removed the Cuban dictator Batista from power, and he begins nationalizing land in Cuba. This leads Eisenhower to issue an embargo 禁运 against Cuba, turning Cuba closer and closer to the Soviet Union. There you can see Castro and Khrushchev having a cuddle session. And eventually when JFK takes office, he tries the Bay of Pigs plan 猪湾计划 -- Cuban exiles 流亡者 are going to go to Cuba try to overthrow Castro, and it is going to fail. Not too long after that in 1962, the U.S. discovers the presence of Soviet missiles -- nuclear missiles -- in Cuba. This leads to the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the U.S. and the Soviet Union are extremely close to war. Luckily they negotiate an end to this crisis.

好的，各位！今天我们来看一下APUSH第八时期——从1945年二战结束，一直到1980年罗纳德·里根当选总统。在考试中，这个时期约占APUSH考试的15%，所以让我们开始吧。

二战后出现了一些变化和延续性。重要的是要记住，与一战后不同，美国将在二战后的事务中发挥关键作用。我给你们举个例子——美国在一战后没有加入国际联盟。记住，威尔逊的计划被参议院否决了。但美国将在1945年加入新的国际组织——联合国（UN）。也会有一些相似之处——记住威尔逊的十四点原则——嗯，许多类似的想法都将出现在罗斯福和丘吉尔签署的《大西洋宪章》中。

二战后最重要的是冷战即将开始。这将是两个超级大国——美国和苏联——之间意识形态、政治和军事的斗争，这场斗争将持续大约从1946年到1991年苏联解体。在整个冷战期间，美国将奉行一项称为“遏制”的政策。这将由乔治·凯南阐述，美国将采取各种方法和途径来遏制共产主义。大部分时间这将通过间接的军事冲突和支持来完成。你们经常会看到，在此期间，美国向试图抵抗被认为或实际存在的共产主义侵略的国家承诺提供军事和财政援助。

例如，你们看到了杜鲁门主义，我们向希腊和土耳其提供了4亿美元，以防止它们落入共产主义之手。我们在两国都取得了成功。杜鲁门政府设立了马歇尔计划——我们向西欧提供了数十亿美元的资金来重建这些国家，特别是法国和意大利，以便在选举中人们不会倾向于投票给共产党人。这也是一个巨大的成功。在中国内战期间，美国将向蒋介石领导的国民党提供大量资金。然而，这并不是一项成功的政策，因为在1949年，共产党人毛泽东宣布成立中华人民共和国。

美国将奉行各种集体安全协议。我们已经提到了联合国，但我们还将加入第一个永久和平时期的军事联盟——有点忘记了乔治·华盛顿告别演说的警告——当我们签署并加入北大西洋公约组织（NATO）时。基本上，这个军事联盟的意思是，如果一个成员国受到攻击，将被视为对所有成员国的攻击。美国还将通过中央情报局（CIA）参与间接的军事冲突，尤其是在德怀特·艾森豪威尔政府时期开始，中央情报局将试图推翻危地马拉和伊朗的政权。

最后，随着时间的推移，美国将发现自己在全球范围内过度承诺，在尼克松总统领导下，你们将看到尼克松主义，我们基本上会对越南和其他国家说——你们必须自己战斗。美国将向你们提供资金和军事装备，但不会派遣美国士兵。在越南，这始终被称为越南战争中的“越南化政策”。

整个冷战期间还将出现军事力量的扩张。这是遏制共产主义的关键手段之一，你们将在整个冷战期间看到一场军备竞赛。这在杜鲁门总统根据国家安全委员会第68号文件（NSC-68）的建议在朝鲜战争期间扩充军备中可见一斑。在艾森豪威尔总统领导下，你们看到了“新面貌”政策，该政策强调和依赖核武器——“花更少的钱，办更多的事”是其理念。而其真正关键在于“大规模报复”的思想——我们将通过建立我们的核武库来威慑苏联。他们将不愿采取行动，因为他们知道我们会摧毁他们。肯尼迪总统将通过一种称为“灵活反应”的政策来改变其外交政策的军事开支——拥有多种选择，因为你们不能在所有情况下都使用核武器。

冷战的另一个组成部分将是太空竞赛。你们将看到，尤其是在1957年苏联发射人造卫星后，我们感觉自己落后于苏联。因此，不仅对美国国家航空航天局（NASA）进行了大规模的资金投入，而且通过《国防教育法》也对教育进行了大量投资。当然，记住肯尼迪总统著名的演讲，他说我们将把一个人送上月球，这将在1969年实现，当时美国成为第一个将人类送上月球的国家。

现在，在直接军事行动方面，美国将有几次直接使用军事力量来阻止共产主义的时刻。最著名的是在朝鲜——始于1950年朝鲜入侵韩国，跨越了三八线。这是一场有限战争——意味着战争的目的仅仅是阻止共产主义在韩国蔓延。战争期间，关于这一战略存在争议，但最终遏制政策由杜鲁门总统和后来的艾森豪威尔总统实现。当然，最重要的是越南战争，在所谓的“东京湾事件”——我们据称在东京湾遭到袭击——之后，林登·约翰逊总统加剧了美国的介入。我们开始了“滚雷行动”，轰炸北越。经过三年的战斗，我们被告知美国人民即将取得胜利。然而，1968年的春节攻势却证明了事实并非如此，战争变得越来越有争议。所有这些都是美国在冷战期间试图遏制或威胁共产主义的方式的例子。

重要的是要记住，在整个冷战期间，存在着“缓和”时期——紧张局势的缓和。冷战出现了“解冻”，你们可以看到这些相互共存的时期。冷战的第一次真正“解冻”可以追溯到艾森豪威尔总统时期，艾克呼吁缓和与苏联领导人尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫的紧张关系并减少军备竞赛。他们提出了“原子能为和平服务”计划。事实上，在1955年，他们会面了——艾森豪威尔总统与苏联领导人会面——你们看到了日内瓦会议，许多人开始谈论这两个超级大国之间的“日内瓦精神”。然而，这种共存时期被U-2侦察机被击落事件所破坏。但再一次，在1962年古巴导弹危机之后，当时两个超级大国几乎处于战争边缘，华盛顿特区和莫斯科之间安装了一条直接热线。

你们最应该熟悉的缓和时期也许是在尼克松总统及其外交政策顾问基辛格领导下。尼克松真正试图利用中国和苏联之间的不信任和敌对关系——所谓的“中苏分裂”。他将在1972年2月访问中国时这样做——他是第一位访问中国的美国总统——与毛泽东会面。此后不久，他帮助谈判达成了《第一阶段限制战略武器会谈》（SALT I），该会谈旨在限制核武器。然而，进一步的会谈将被破坏——当苏联于1979年入侵阿富汗时，《第二阶段限制战略武器会谈》（SALT II）将被破坏。但记住，冷战将在直接冲突、间接冲突和缓和时期之间波动。

关于第八时期，另一个需要理解的重要问题是，冷战政策如何导致了关于联邦政府权力、追求国际和国内目标的合理方式以及自由与秩序之间适当平衡的辩论。这些主题的一些例子可以在辩论中看到——尤其是在关于日益增长的核武库存在的日益激烈的辩论中。艾森豪威尔总统在他的告别演说中警告国家关于军事工业复合体以及日益增长的军备竞赛如何威胁美国国内生活。你们将看到各种军备控制协议——最著名的当然可能是《限制战略武器会谈》（SALT）协议。但你们也将看到关于行政部门权力以及总统权力日益增长的辩论。

杜鲁门总统和他的将军道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟之间存在争议——麦克阿瑟因批评杜鲁门对战争的处理方式，即有限战争战略而被解雇。1964年的《东京湾决议》给了约翰逊总统一张空白支票，许多人认为这是总统权力过度的表现，扩大了越南战争。而在1973年，你们将看到旨在限制总统发动战争权力的《战争权力法案》。

在整个冷战期间，你们将看到国内对冷战政策的反对。关于朝鲜战争的辩论有限——一些人辩论有限战争的优点，特别是批评杜鲁门处理战争方式的共和党人。他们认为他过于软弱。然而，国内反对的主要时刻将是越南战争。越南战争使国家严重分裂为“鹰派”（那些支持战争的人）和“鸽派”（那些反对战争的人）。而像1968年的春节攻势和轰炸柬埔寨这样的事件真正加剧并增加了反战运动。事实上，在尼克松总统任期内轰炸柬埔寨的消息导致了肯特州立大学的抗议活动，导致四名大学生死亡。大学校园的抗议活动蔓延到全国。

由于冷战，你们将看到这对国内生活产生了影响。在努力平衡公民自由与秩序和安全之间出现了挑战。40年代末和50年代发生的一个关键事件是对共产主义影响和渗透美国生活的广泛恐惧。像阿尔杰·希斯以及朱利叶斯和埃塞尔·罗森堡夫妇间谍案的揭露在美国引起了广泛的恐惧。这导致了参议员约瑟夫·麦卡锡和麦卡锡主义的兴起——在几乎没有或根本没有证据的情况下指控他人。在40年代末和50年代初，你们看到了第二次红色恐慌。事实上，甚至在此之前，你们就看到了联邦雇员忠诚计划，该计划调查了政府内部联邦雇员的背景，许多人失去了工作。事实上，你们看到了在二战后重新启动的众议院非美活动调查委员会（HUAC），其目的是清除和搜寻美国生活中的共产主义影响。人们经常被带到委员会面前，并被迫指认他人——例如，好莱坞十人就被带到了委员会面前。

尽管如此，对于这些政策的批评，重要的是要注意，共和党和民主党都支持遏制共产主义的政策。然而，在采取的方法和途径上存在争议。

一个非常重要的需要记住的思想是二战后的非殖民化，殖民帝国的崩溃导致美国和苏联都在亚洲、拉丁美洲、非洲和中东争夺影响力。你们将在越南看到这一点，胡志明在二战后试图摆脱法国的统治。你们将看到，这些曾经是殖民地的地区将成为美国和苏联外交政策的目标。

你们可以在中东看到一些这样的例子。美国有各种各样的利益——意识形态上，我们在二战后立即支持以色列，但也支持任何非共产主义政权。经济上的考虑——获得石油——以及军事战略上的考虑。美国政策及其如何受到冷战影响的一些例子可以在“阿贾克斯行动”中看到——1953年艾森豪威尔总统利用中央情报局帮助推翻了民选的伊朗政府。这导致了各种各样的问题。在苏伊士运河危机中——埃及总统纳赛尔是一位民族主义者，他将苏伊士运河国有化，结果英国、法国和以色列——在没有与美国协商的情况下——袭击了埃及。这引发了一场巨大的危机，最终艾森豪威尔总统不得不进行干预以结束战争，并促使艾森豪威尔发布了艾森豪威尔主义，该主义基本上声明美国承诺向任何受到共产主义侵略威胁的中东国家提供经济和军事援助。

1960年，石油输出国组织（OPEC）成立，旨在控制石油供应和贸易。这将对美国的能源政策产生巨大影响。在尼克松政府时期的赎罪日战争期间，埃及和叙利亚突然袭击以色列，美国以经济和军事支持的形式向以色列提供援助。这导致石油输出国组织中的石油富国对美国实施石油禁运。最后，关于中东需要记住的另一点是1978年的戴维营协议。吉米·卡特总统帮助促成了一项协议，以色列和埃及签署了和平协议。

美国也将大量参与拉丁美洲事务。在拉丁美洲，美国支持那些民主程度不一的非共产主义政权。事实上，在1954年，艾森豪威尔总统领导下的中央情报局将推翻民选的阿本斯政府。他们这样做是因为该政府将由联合果品公司拥有的土地国有化，中央情报局将帮助在危地马拉建立一个非常不民主但亲美的政府。

1959年将爆发一场危机，当时在古巴，菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导了一场推翻古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔的革命，他开始将古巴的土地国有化。这导致艾森豪威尔总统对古巴实施禁运，使古巴越来越靠近苏联。你们可以看到卡斯特罗和赫鲁晓夫亲密地在一起。最终，当肯尼迪总统上任后，他尝试了猪湾入侵计划——古巴流亡者将前往古巴试图推翻卡斯特罗，但它将失败。不久之后，在1962年，美国发现了苏联在古巴部署导弹——核导弹。这导致了古巴导弹危机，美国和苏联非常接近战争。幸运的是，他们通过谈判结束了这场危机。

如果你们想了解更多关于这些材料的信息，请务必查看描述中的其他视频。别忘了第八时期回顾系列的第二部分，我们在其中为你们分析了国内事务。如果这个视频对你们有任何帮助，请点赞，如果还没有订阅，请订阅。告诉你们所有的朋友也这样做。记住，当你们在五月份参加APUSH考试时，要像照片中的约翰·布朗那样自信地进入考场，然后一举拿下五分。感谢你们的观看。祝你们度过美好的一天。再见！

What's up, people? Today we're taking a look at APUSH period 8 -- 1945, the end of World War II, all the way up until 1980, the election of Ronald Reagan. On the exam, this period is about 15% of the APUSH test, so let's get started.

Some change in continuity post-World War II. It's important to keep in mind that unlike in the post-World War I period, the U.S. will play a key role in post-World War II affairs. Let me give you an example -- U.S. does not join the League of Nations following World War I. Remember Wilson's plan is rejected by the Senate. But the U.S. will join the new international organization, the United Nations (the UN), in 1945. There will be some similarities -- remember Wilson with his 14 points -- well, a lot of those similar ideas are going to be found in the document signed by Roosevelt and Churchill called the Atlantic Charter.

Most important thing in post-World War II is the Cold War is going to begin. It will be an ideological, political and military struggle between the two superpowers -- the United States and the Soviet Union -- and this thing is going to last from around 1946 to 1991, the fall of the Soviet Union. Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. is going to pursue a policy called containment. It's going to be articulated by George Kennan, and the U.S. is going to pursue a variety of methods and ways to try to contain communism. Most of the time this is going to be done with indirect military conflict and support. Very often you're going to see during this time the U.S. pledging military and financial assistance to countries trying to resist perceived or real communist aggression.

So for example, you get the Truman Doctrine where we give $400 million to Greece and Turkey to keep them from falling to the communists. We are successful in both countries. Marshall Plan is established under the Truman Administration -- we give billions of dollars of money to Western Europe to rebuild countries, especially France and Italy, so that in the elections people won't be inclined to vote for the communists. That is a huge success as well. During the Chinese Civil War, the U.S. is going to give a lot of money to the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek. However, that is not going to be a successful policy because in 1949, Mao the communist declares the People's Republic of China.

The U.S. is going to pursue all sorts of collective security agreements. We've already mentioned the United Nations, but we're also going to join the first permanent peacetime military alliance -- kind of forgetting the warnings of George Washington's Farewell Address -- when we sign up and join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). And basically what this military alliance said was if there was an attack on one member, it was considered an attack on all. The U.S. is also going to be involved in indirect military conflict with its use of the CIA, especially starting with Dwight Eisenhower's Administration, where the CIA is going to try to get rid of regimes in Guatemala and Iran.

And then finally, as time goes on, the U.S. is going to find itself overcommitted around the world, and under President Nixon you're going to have the Nixon Doctrine where we're basically going to say to Vietnam and other countries -- you are going to have to do your own fighting. The U.S. will provide you with money and military equipment but not U.S. soldiers. At all times this is going to be known as the policy of Vietnamization in Vietnam.

There's also going to be military buildup throughout the Cold War. It's one of the key parts of trying to contain communism, and you are going to have an arms race throughout the Cold War. This can really be seen in Truman building up the military during the Korean War under the recommendations of NSC-68. Under Eisenhower, you have the New Look policy where there's this stress and reliance on nuclear weapons -- "more bang for the buck" was the idea. And really key to this is this idea of massive retaliation -- that we will deter the Soviets by building up our nuclear arsenal. They will be reluctant to make moves 'cause they know we're going to blow them up. Kennedy is going to alter his foreign policy military spending with something called flexible response -- having a variety of options available because you can't use nukes in all situations.

Another part of the Cold War is going to be the Space Race. You're going to see this where especially after Sputnik in 1957, we feel like we're falling behind the Soviet Union. So you have this mass funding for not only NASA but also education with the National Defense Education Act. And of course, remember Kennedy with this famous speech says we are going to put a man on the moon, and this will happen in 1969 when the U.S. becomes the first country to put a man on the moon.

Now over in that direct military column, there is going to be moments where the U.S. is going to use direct military force to stop communism. Most famously in Korea -- started in 1950 when North Korea invades South Korea crossing the 38th parallel. This is a limited war -- meaning the war is only meant to stop communism from South Korea. There's a debate during the war about this strategy, but ultimately containment is achieved by Truman and then Eisenhower. And then of course the big one is going to be the Vietnam War, where really after the Gulf of Tonkin resolution -- where we were allegedly attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin -- President Lyndon Johnson escalates American involvement. We start Operation Rolling Thunder where we're bombing North Vietnam. And after 3 years of fighting, we're being told the American people are near victory. However, the Tet Offensive in 1968 really proves otherwise, and the war increasingly becomes controversial. All of these are examples of ways the U.S. sought to contain or threaten communism during the Cold War.

It's important to keep in mind throughout the Cold War that there were periods of détente -- or relaxation of tensions. There were thaws in the Cold War, and you could see this periods of mutual coexistence. Really kind of the first thaw of the Cold War can be seen under Eisenhower where Ike calls for a relaxation of tensions and a reduction in the arms race with the Soviet counterpart Nikita Khrushchev. They have the "Atoms for Peace" plan proposed. In fact in 1955, they meet -- Eisenhower meets with Soviet leaders -- and you get the Geneva Conference, and many start to talk about the "spirit of Geneva" between these two superpowers. However, this period of coexistence is going to be ruined by the shooting down of the U-2 spy plane incident. But once again, following the Cuban Missile Crisis where the two superpowers were close to war in 1962, a direct hotline was installed between Washington D.C. and Moscow.

Perhaps the period of détente that you should most be familiar with is under Nixon and his foreign policy adviser Kissinger. And Nixon's really going to seek to take advantage of the distrust and rivalry between China and the Soviet Union -- this so-called Sino-Soviet split. And he's going to do so when he visits China -- the first U.S. president to do so -- in February of 1972 to meet with Mao. Shortly after that, he helps negotiate the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) which was designed to limit nuclear weapons. However, further talks are going to be ruined -- SALT II will be ruined when the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan in 1979. But keep in mind the Cold War is going to fluctuate between these periods of direct conflict, indirect conflict and periods of détente.

Another important thing to understand about period 8 is how Cold War policies led to debate over the power of the federal government, acceptable ways of pursuing international and domestic goals, and the proper balance between liberty and order. And some examples of these themes can be seen in the debate -- especially the growing debate over the presence of a growing nuclear arsenal. Eisenhower warned the nation in his farewell address about the military-industrial complex and how the growing arms race was a threat to American domestic life. You are going to see various arms control agreements -- the most famous one of course probably being the SALT agreement, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. But you're also going to see this debate over the power of the executive branch and the growing power of the presidency.

There was a dispute between Truman and his general Douglas MacArthur -- MacArthur is fired for criticizing Truman's handling of the war, the limited war strategy. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution in 1964 gives President Johnson a blank check, and many people see this as an excessive amount of presidential power that widens the Vietnam War. And in 1973, you're going to have the War Powers Act which is designed to limit presidential war-making power.

Throughout the Cold War, you're going to see domestic opposition to Cold War policies. There was limited debate over the Korean War -- some people debated the merits of a limited war, especially Republicans who criticized Truman's handling of the war. They saw him as being too weak. And the big moment though in domestic opposition is going to be with Vietnam. The Vietnam War bitterly divided the nation between hawks -- those people who were for the war -- and doves -- those who were against the war. And really events like the Tet Offensive in 1968 and the bombing of Cambodia escalate and increase the anti-war movement. In fact, the news of the bombing of Cambodia during Nixon's presidency led to the Kent State protest which led to the deaths of four college students. And college campus protests spread throughout the country.

And as a result of the Cold War, you are going to have this impacting domestic life. The challenge arose over the effort to balance civil liberties with order and security. One of the key things that happens in the late 40s and 50s is a widespread fear of communist influence and infiltration in American life. Revelations of people like Alger Hiss and the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's revelations of spy rings in America causes widespread fear. This leads to the rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism -- this accusing of people with little or no evidence. And in the late 40s, early 50s, you have a second Red Scare. In fact even before this time, you have the Federal Employee Loyalty Program which investigated the background of federal employees within the government, and many people lost their jobs. In fact, you have the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) which is restarted after World War II, and it is designed to root out and search for communist influence in American life. Very often people were brought before the committee and forced to name names -- for example, you have the Hollywood Ten brought before the committee.

In spite of this, criticisms over these policies, it's important to note both Republicans and Democrats supported the policy of containing communism. However, there were disputes at the methods and ways to do this.

A really important idea to keep in mind is post-World War II decolonization, and you have the collapse of colonial empires leading both the U.S. and the Soviet Union competing for influence in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. You're going to see this in Vietnam as Ho Chi Minh is trying to get rid of the French following World War II. And you're going to see that these areas of the world that were former colonies are going to be the target of both U.S. and Soviet foreign policy.

Some examples of this you can be seen in the Middle East. The U.S. had a variety of interests -- ideologically we had support for Israel immediately following World War II, but also any regime that was non-communist. Economic concerns -- access to oil -- as well as military strategic concerns. Some examples of U.S. policy and how it was impacted by the Cold War could be seen in Operation Ajax -- President Eisenhower in 1953 used the CIA to help overthrow the democratically elected Iranian government. This causes all sorts of problems. And in the Suez Crisis -- President Nasser of Egypt, he is a nationalist, he nationalizes the Suez Canal, and as a result England, France and Israel -- without consulting the United States -- attacks Egypt. This causes a huge crisis and eventually Eisenhower has to intervene to end the war, and prompts Eisenhower to issue the Eisenhower Doctrine which basically stated the U.S. promised economic military aid to any Middle Eastern country threatened by communist aggression.

In 1960, you get the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) formed which is designed to control the oil supply and trade. This is going to have a huge impact on U.S. energy policy. And during the Yom Kippur War during Nixon's Administration, Egypt and Syria suddenly attacked Israel, and the U.S. provides aid to Israel in the form of economic and military support. This contributes to an oil embargo it's imposed on the United States by the oil-rich nations in OPEC. And finally another thing to keep in mind with regard to the Middle East -- the Camp David Accords in 1978. President Jimmy Carter helps negotiate a deal in which Israel and Egypt sign a peace agreement.

The U.S. is also heavily going to be involved in Latin America. And in Latin America, the U.S. supported non-communist regimes with varying levels of democracy. In fact in 1954, the CIA under President Eisenhower is going to overthrow the democratically elected Árbenz government. They will do so because the government is going to nationalize land held by the United Fruit Company, and the CIA is going to help bring into power a very undemocratic government but pro-U.S. government in Guatemala.

There's going to be a crisis in 1959 when in Cuba, Fidel Castro led a revolution that removed the Cuban dictator Batista from power, and he begins nationalizing land in Cuba. This leads Eisenhower to issue an embargo against Cuba, turning Cuba closer and closer to the Soviet Union. There you can see Castro and Khrushchev having a cuddle session. And eventually when JFK takes office, he tries the Bay of Pigs plan -- Cuban exiles are going to go to Cuba try to overthrow Castro, and it is going to fail. Not too long after that in 1962, the U.S. discovers the presence of Soviet missiles -- nuclear missiles -- in Cuba. This leads to the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the U.S. and the Soviet Union are extremely close to war. Luckily they negotiate an end to this crisis.
