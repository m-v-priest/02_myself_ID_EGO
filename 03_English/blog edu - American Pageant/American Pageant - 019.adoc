What up APUSH 美国历史课程 people. + 
 Today we are going to review the Civil War 内战. + 
 If you're using any of those APUSH books, those chapters will be reviewed in this video. + 
 And it's important to keep in mind that the actual fighting of the Civil War doesn't begin until the attack on Fort Sumter 萨姆特堡. + 


But even before that attack, seven Southern States (those states in the blue) had left the union 联邦 before Lincoln took office in March of 1861. + 
 And they leave because of the election of Lincoln and the Republican party on a Free Soil 自由土地 platform. + 
 And one of the things Lincoln is very careful not to do is to provoke 激怒 the other Southern States. + 
 In fact, in his inaugural 就职的 address, he pledges 保证 not to interfere with slavery where it already exists. + 
 He does tell Southerners (those seven southern states): "You have no right of secession 脱离联邦. + 
 It doesn't make any sense for you to be doing what you're doing. + 
"

And Lincoln's early goals in this initial period is to not let the last two Federal properties 联邦财产 be taken over by the Confederacy 邦联. + 
 And one of those was in the port of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, called Fort Sumter. + 
 And Fort Sumter is running out of supplies 补给, and Lincoln tells the Confederacy: "We're sending provisions 供应品. + 
 We're not sending reinforcements 增援部队. + 
 This is not meant to be an aggressive 侵略性的 move. + 
" Nonetheless, in April of 1861, the Confederacy attacks Fort Sumter, beginning the fighting of the nation's bloodiest 血腥的 war. + 


Now the impact of Fort Sumter is huge. + 
 One, this unites Northerners behind this idea of preserving 保存 the Union. + 
 Lincoln calls on volunteers 志愿者 to come fight, and Northerners rally around 团结在. + 
. + 
. + 
周围 Lincoln and this idea of fighting the war to preserve the union. + 
 The second impact is four more Southern States join the Confederacy (those states in the pink), including the very populated Virginia. + 
 And then finally, Lincoln's really kind of priority 优先事项 from the start was keeping the border states 边境州 from leaving the Union as well. + 


So what are these border states? These border states are pivotal 关键的 to the war effort and Lincoln's strategy. + 
 The border states are states such as Missouri, Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. + 
 And these are slave states that remain in the union (they're green on this map). + 
 And Lincoln's goal is to keep them in the union for a couple of reasons. + 
 They're super important. + 
 Here's why: if those green States left (those border states), it would have given more white men to fight for the Confederacy. + 
 A lot of the manufacturing 制造业 that the South had (what little it did have) was found in the border states. + 
 And if they left, it would have nearly doubled the capacity 能力 of the South to produce for the war effort. + 
 And then finally, geographic location. + 
 If States like Maryland and Delaware left the Union, Washington DC (the capital) would be surrounded 被包围. + 
 They would be closer to the union. + 
 So there's a lot of reasons why Lincoln needs to keep these border states in the union side. + 


And he does so by a variety of methods. + 
 He mobilizes 动员 the federal government and (in some people's minds) in questionable 可疑的 ways. + 
 Martial law 戒严令 is declared in Maryland. + 
 Guerilla Warfare 游击战 takes place in Missouri. + 
 And you're going to see the suspension 中止 of the writ of habeas corpus 人身保护令 in some of the border states. + 
 We'll get back to that in a moment. + 


Now both (besides the union and the Confederacy) have advantages and disadvantages when this war begins. + 
 For the north, they have the industrial 工业的 resources. + 
 The majority of the manufacturing was in the north (you should know this already). + 
 Transportation advantage was the North's as well. + 
 The railroad (what railroad was in the nation) was largely in the north. + 
 There was a powerful navy. + 
 They had an established government (an established federal government was a northern advantage). + 
 And then finally, they had the population advantage: 22 million people in the north versus 9 million in the South. + 
 And then eventually, when emancipation 解放 takes place, that's going to offer advantages as well. + 


There are disadvantages for our Northern homies 朋友. + 
 There's a lack of leadership. + 
 A lot of the top military leaders join the Confederacy (people like Robert E. + 
 Lee). + 
 And so the South has those veteran 经验丰富的 leaders. + 
 And then they have a lack of purpose. + 
 For a lot of Northerners, it was: "Why are we fighting a war to keep these states that don't want to be in the Union? Let them go, let them go, let them go. + 
"

Now the Confederate states have some advantages and disadvantages. + 
 For one, the Confederacy is fighting a defensive war 防御战. + 
 All they have to do is defend their land. + 
 And they have the advantage of fighting amongst a friendly population. + 
 They have the sense of purpose. + 
 They're fighting (in their mind) for the southern way of life, Southern honor. + 
 They have (as I mentioned previously) veteran military officials. + 
 And those are some of those advantages. + 
 And of course, cotton diplomacy 棉花外交. + 
 They were really hoping that the importance of cotton to the international market (especially England) would get them foreign recognition 外国承认 and financial assistance 财政援助. + 
 We'll see how that turns out. + 


The disadvantages were numerous though for the Confederacy. + 
 They had no navy, no government structure. + 
 In fact, there's a strong sense of independence and state rights. + 
 This is going to be hard for the Confederacy to deal with during the war. + 
 And you're going to have a very, very poorly equipped 装备差的 Southern society: a weak economy, lack of manufacturing, and no major rail system. + 
 So both these sides had advantages and disadvantages, but you had to mobilize for war. + 


The north passes the first draft 征兵 (the Conscription Act 征兵法案) in March of 1863. + 
 In the union, all men ages 20 to 45 had to register for the draft. + 
 Now this was unfair to the poor because if you had money, you could get a substitute 替代者 (the so-called $300 men who would take your place). + 
 And the same thing was kind of done in the South. + 
 The South had its equivalent (the so-called 20 negro law 20名黑人法律) where if you owned more than 20 slaves, you could be exempt 免除 from military service. + 
 And as a result of this anger over this unfairness, there were riots 暴乱. + 
 In fact, the most famous ones are taking place in July of 1863: the New York City draft riots. + 
 Mobs 暴民 of mostly Irish Americans (who were serving in the Union Army in huge numbers) start attacking the wealthy and also African-Americans because they blame them for this war taking place. + 


Now important to keep in mind in this chapter is that Lincoln is going to proclaim 宣布 he was not fighting the war to end slavery. + 
 Did you hear that? He wasn't fighting the war to end slavery. + 
 And there's a reason why (even though Lincoln personally was against slavery) that he can't say it's about slavery. + 
 One, secession was not legal. + 
 So therefore in his mind, the South never really left. + 
 It was rebels 叛乱者 within the southern states that left. + 
 Two (and this is the key), the border states. + 
 If he makes the war about slavery, those border states are going to say: "Deuces, peace. + 
" There's also a fear from white workers in the north what emancipation would mean to them (what that looks like on their end). + 
 And then finally, political concerns amongst Northerners. + 
 You have Northern Democrats and Northern Republicans all wanting their position represented by Lincoln. + 
 But eventually, this war is going to become a war about emancipation. + 


So how do we get there? Well, there's really two reasons to free the slaves. + 
 One is military: if you liberate 解放 the slaves, it undermines 破坏 the economic foundation of the South and it makes it more difficult for them to fight the war. + 
 The other is obvious: ideological 意识形态的. + 
 It's the right thing to do. + 
 And there's pressure on Lincoln to do so amongst Radical Republicans 激进共和党人. + 
 Radical Republicans (people like Charles Sumner, the guy that got hit over the head with the cane; Thaddeus Stevens; and Benjamin Wade) were pressuring Lincoln to make the war about slavery. + 
 They were abolitionists, and they wanted this war to be a war to end slavery. + 
 And slowly it becomes that. + 


In August of 1861, you have the Confiscation Act 没收法案 in which it is declared that slaves used for insurrectionary 叛乱的 purposes would be declared free. + 
 And this gives runaway slaves an incentive 激励 to head north towards Union camps, and that undermines the South's ability to fight the war. + 
 In fact, the term "contraband 违禁品" (make sure you know that) is a term for runaway slaves. + 
 In July of 1862, you have the second Confiscation Act which basically said all slaves who were enslaved by anybody engaged in rebellion are free. + 
 And so slowly you have this kind of emancipation taking place. + 


And the big one is the Emancipation Proclamation 解放宣言 in January 1st, 1863 (following the Battle of Antietam 安提塔姆战役, which is a union victory - it's technically a draw; Robert E. + 
 Lee retreats). + 
 Lincoln decides to move forward with announcing the Emancipation Proclamation, and it is justified as a military necessity 军事需要. + 
 It declares slaves free in rebel territory throughout the Confederacy, but it does not free slaves in the border states (very important you know that). + 


Now the impact: it strengthens the moral cause of the north. + 
 It gives the north a sense of moral purpose. + 
 This is not just a war against secession; it's against slavery. + 
 It also helps keep Europe from aiding the Confederacy (especially England) because if they do so, they're fighting a war to defend slavery, and that would be very unpopular over in Europe. + 
 Also, new soldiers for the Union Army: African-American men (former slaves - the freedmen 自由人) are going to sign up in huge numbers. + 
 There's also some limits: keep in mind it freed the slaves in rebel territory, but the North had no authority in the Confederacy. + 
 It also did not apply to the border states. + 
 So there's still a huge number of slaves still in bondage 奴役. + 
 But it's an important moment in the war. + 


Another important thing you should keep in mind is the African-American fight for freedom. + 
 Frederick Douglass and other leaders of the north saw enlistment 入伍 in the Union Army as an opportunity to prove their citizenship 公民身份. + 
 For African-American men (you know, remember Dred Scott's decision had said African-Americans are not citizens of the United States), and for Douglass and others, this was their way to prove it and fight for it. + 
 You have over 180,000 African-Americans serving in the war. + 
 The most famous, of course, is the Massachusetts 54th Regiment 马萨诸塞第54团 (as seen in the movie Glory). + 
 But many, many African-American soldiers fought during the Civil War, but nonetheless face a great deal of prejudice 偏见. + 
 They were often times paid less than white soldiers. + 


Another key thing you should keep in mind is the use of executive power 行政权力. + 
 Civil liberties 公民自由 are often times reduced during times of national crisis. + 
 So as we look at different wars, keep in mind: how are people's liberty being infringed upon 被侵犯? And you see this: Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in border states such as Maryland. + 
 And the writ of habeas corpus basically says that you have the right to be informed of the charges against you, and you have a right to prove your innocence 无罪 by having a trial. + 
 This was denied to people in States like Maryland because in Lincoln's mind, this was necessary for our nation's security and to preserve the union. + 


There's also this kind of increase in presidential power you should be aware of. + 
 Often times, presidential power increases during times of war. + 
 And for instance, Lincoln ordered a blockade 封锁 without the approval of Congress. + 
 Lincoln said: "We got to do it. + 
" He increases the size of the federal army without the approval of Congress. + 
 Both those things are powers granted to Congress, but Lincoln does it because we are at war and feels it is necessary. + 


Politics of the war is another thing you should keep in mind. + 
 You know, there are challenges for the Confederacy. + 
 Cotton diplomacy (as I mentioned), they were hoping that they would get European intervention 干预. + 
 Europe though obtained cotton from other sources (for example, Egypt and India). + 
 And the failure at Antietam (you know, Robert E. + 
 Lee was trying to get a win, doesn't get one). + 
 And as a result, in addition, the Emancipation Proclamation in January - all of those factors prevent European intervention on behalf of the Confederacy. + 


The other challenge for the Confederacy is the tradition of state rights. + 
 It makes fighting the war difficult. + 
 Jefferson Davis (the president of the Confederacy) oftentimes found states reluctant 不情愿的 to send troops outside of their borders on behalf of the Confederacy. + 
 Lincoln had problems as well, and those challenges for Lincoln you'll see were amongst people within his own party. + 
 Very often, the Radical Republicans criticize him for moving too slow on the issue of emancipation. + 
 And you had War Democrats 战争民主党人 (Northern Democrats who support the war but criticize Lincoln's handling of it). + 
 And of course, there were also Peace Democrats 和平民主党人 (and the more radical ones called Copperheads 铜头蛇) who opposed the war and wanted a negotiated peace. + 


Lincoln does run for re-election in 1864, and he does beat his former General (General McClellan). + 
 And one of the big reasons he wins that is because the union starts winning some victories in places like Atlanta. + 


Now one of the key things that happens during the war (and it has nothing really significant about the battles) was there were Republican majority in Congress. + 
 When the South leaves the union, they forfeit 丧失 their right to political power in Congress. + 
 So you get the north getting all sorts of things done without any Democrat or Southern opposition to really block it. + 


In 1861, you get the Morrill Tariff 莫里尔关税 which helps pay for the war by increasing the tariff rates and protecting Northern industry. + 
 You get the Homestead Act 宅地法 in 1862 which sets up the sale of land in the west and encourages settlement. + 
 In 1862, you get the Legal Tender Act 法定货币法案 which allows for the printing of money (paper money - the greenbacks 美钞). + 
 The National Bank Act 国家银行法 establishes the financial health and well-being and unifies the banking system. + 
 And you also get the Pacific Railway Act 太平洋铁路法案 which establishes a northern route for the transcontinental railroad 横贯大陆铁路. + 
 And of course, the big one: the Emancipation Proclamation. + 


Real quick rundown of the impact of the Civil War (and there's a whole bunch of them). + 
 The most obvious one is the enormous loss of life: over 600,000 people are going to die from the fighting in this brutal 残酷的 war. + 
 The Southern economy is going to be destroyed, and the northern economy (Northern industrialization) is going to be accelerated by the war. + 
 In fact, in the post-war period, you're going to see a mass industrialization 工业化 take place largely in the north. + 
 The Republican laws that are going to be passed are going to have a huge impact in the post-war years (especially the Homestead Act, the Pacific Railroad Act, and others). + 
 The union is going to be preserved (that's what the initial meaning or reason for the war was). + 
 And the idea of secession and nullification 废止 is going to be defeated. + 
 We kept seeing those things come up, and the Civil War kind of crushes that as an option for future generations. + 


And probably something that's really lost for a lot of people is: the Civil War was the ultimate test for American democracy, and it survives. + 
 And then lastly, enormously important: 4 million people are going to be suddenly freed as a result of the war as the war changes from one just about the union to one about the issue of slavery. + 
 The 13th Amendment 第十三修正案 is going to emancipate 解放 4 million individuals. +

各位APUSH的同学们，大家好。今天我们要复习美国内战。如果你正在使用任何一本APUSH的教材，那么这些章节都会在这段视频中进行复习。需要记住的是，南北战争的实际战斗直到萨姆特堡被袭击后才开始。

但在那次袭击之前，七个南方州（地图上蓝色的那些州）在林肯1861年3月就职之前就已经脱离了联邦。他们脱离的原因是林肯和共和党在自由土地纲领上的胜选。林肯非常小心地避免激怒其他南方州。事实上，在他的就职演说中，他承诺不干涉已经存在奴隶制的地区。他确实告诉南方人（那七个南方州）：“你们没有脱离联邦的权利。你们现在所做的事情毫无道理。”

林肯在这个初期阶段的首要目标是不让南方邦联夺取最后两个联邦财产。其中一个位于南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿港，名为萨姆特堡。萨姆特堡的补给即将耗尽，林肯告诉南方邦联：“我们正在运送给养，而不是增援部队。这并非旨在采取侵略行动。” 然而，在1861年4月，南方邦联袭击了萨姆特堡，开始了美国历史上最血腥的战争。

现在，萨姆特堡事件的影响是巨大的。首先，它团结了北方人维护联邦的意愿。林肯号召志愿者参战，北方人团结在林肯和维护联邦的战争理念周围。第二个影响是又有四个南方州（地图上粉色的那些州）加入了南方邦联，包括人口众多的弗吉尼亚州。最后，林肯从一开始的首要任务就是阻止边境州脱离联邦。

那么，什么是这些边境州呢？这些边境州对于战争努力和林肯的战略至关重要。边境州包括密苏里州、肯塔基州、特拉华州和马里兰州。这些是仍然留在联邦内的蓄奴州（在地图上是绿色的）。林肯的目标是出于几个原因将它们留在联邦内。它们非常重要。原因如下：如果那些绿色的州（边境州）脱离联邦，南方邦联就会有更多的白人可以参战。南方拥有的许多制造业（即使很少）都位于边境州。如果它们脱离联邦，南方邦联的战争生产能力几乎会增加一倍。最后是地理位置。如果马里兰州和特拉华州等州脱离联邦，华盛顿特区（首都）将被包围。它们将更靠近联邦。因此，林肯有很多理由需要将这些边境州留在联邦一方。

他通过各种方法做到了这一点。他动员了联邦政府，并且（在一些人看来）以令人质疑的方式进行。马里兰州宣布实行戒严。密苏里州发生了游击战。你们将会看到人身保护令在一些边境州被中止。我们稍后再讨论这个问题。

现在，战争开始时，双方（联邦和邦联）都有各自的优势和劣势。对于北方来说，他们拥有工业资源。大部分制造业都在北方（你们应该已经知道这一点了）。交通运输优势也在北方手中。全国的铁路（当时存在的铁路）大部分都在北方。他们拥有一支强大的海军。他们拥有一个已建立的政府（一个已建立的联邦政府是北方的优势）。最后，他们拥有人口优势：北方有2200万人，而南方只有900万人。最终，当解放奴隶发生时，这也将带来优势。

北方也有劣势。他们缺乏领导力。许多高级军事将领加入了南方邦联（比如罗伯特·E·李）。因此，南方拥有这些经验丰富的将领。而且他们缺乏目标。对于许多北方人来说，问题是：“我们为什么要打一场战争来保留这些不愿留在联邦内的州？让他们走吧，让他们走吧，让他们走吧。”

现在，南方邦联也有一些优势和劣势。首先，南方邦联打的是一场防御战。他们只需要保卫自己的土地。而且他们拥有在友善民众中作战的优势。他们有目标感。他们（在他们看来）是为了南方生活方式和南方荣誉而战。他们拥有（正如我之前提到的）经验丰富的军事官员。这些都是他们的一些优势。当然，还有棉花外交。他们真的希望棉花在国际市场（尤其是英国）的重要性能够为他们赢得外国承认和财政援助。我们看看结果如何。

然而，南方邦联的劣势却很多。他们没有海军，没有政府结构。事实上，存在强烈的独立意识和州权观念。这将在战争期间给南方邦联带来很大的麻烦。你们将会看到一个装备非常非常差的南方社会：经济薄弱，缺乏制造业，没有主要的铁路系统。因此，双方都有优势和劣势，但都必须动员起来进行战争。

北方在1863年3月通过了第一部征兵法（Conscription Act）。在联邦，所有20至45岁的男性都必须登记参加征兵。这对穷人来说是不公平的，因为如果你有钱，你可以找一个替代者（所谓的“三百美元人”会代替你）。南方也做了类似的事情。南方有其等效的法律（所谓的“二十黑奴法”），如果你拥有超过20名奴隶，你可以免服兵役。由于对这种不公平的愤怒，爆发了骚乱。事实上，最著名的骚乱发生在1863年7月：纽约市征兵骚乱。主要是爱尔兰裔美国人（他们在联邦军队中人数众多）组成的暴徒开始袭击富人和非裔美国人，因为他们将战争的发生归咎于他们。

现在，在本章中需要记住的重要一点是，林肯将宣布他发动战争并非为了结束奴隶制。你听到了吗？他发动战争并非为了结束奴隶制。这是有原因的（即使林肯个人反对奴隶制），他也不能说战争是为了奴隶制。首先，脱离联邦是不合法的。因此，在他看来，南方从未真正脱离。是南方各州内的叛乱分子脱离了。第二点（这是关键），是边境州。如果他将战争定义为关于奴隶制，那些边境州就会说：“再见，拜拜。” 北方的白人劳工也担心解放奴隶对他们意味着什么（这对他们来说会是什么样子）。最后，还有北方人之间的政治考量。北方民主党人和北方共和党人都希望林肯代表他们的立场。但最终，这场战争将变成一场关于解放奴隶的战争。

那么我们是如何走到那一步的呢？嗯，解放奴隶实际上有两个原因。一个是军事上的：如果你解放奴隶，它会破坏南方的经济基础，并使他们更难进行战争。另一个是显而易见的：意识形态上的。这是正确的事情。激进共和党人也向林肯施加压力，要求他这样做。激进共和党人（比如查尔斯·萨姆纳，那个被手杖打伤头的人；萨迪厄斯·史蒂文斯；和本杰明·韦德）正在向林肯施压，要求他将战争定义为关于奴隶制。他们是废奴主义者，他们希望这场战争是一场结束奴隶制的战争。而它也慢慢地变成了这样。

1861年8月，通过了《没收法案》，其中宣布用于叛乱目的的奴隶将被宣布为自由人。这激励了逃亡奴隶向北方的联邦军营地前进，从而削弱了南方邦联的作战能力。事实上，“违禁品”（确保你知道这个词）是逃亡奴隶的术语。1862年7月，通过了第二部《没收法案》，该法案基本上规定，所有被任何参与叛乱的人奴役的奴隶都是自由的。因此，这种解放正在慢慢发生。

而最重要的事件是1863年1月1日发布的《解放奴隶宣言》（在联邦胜利的安提耶坦战役之后——技术上是平局；罗伯特·E·李撤退了）。林肯决定推进并宣布《解放奴隶宣言》，其理由是军事上的必要性。它宣布在整个南方邦联的叛乱地区，奴隶都是自由的，但它并没有解放边境州的奴隶（这一点非常重要，你们要记住）。

现在的影响是：它加强了北方的道德理由。它赋予了北方一种道德目标。这不仅仅是一场反对分裂的战争；它也是一场反对奴隶制的战争。它还有助于阻止欧洲（特别是英国）援助南方邦联，因为如果他们这样做，他们就是在打一场捍卫奴隶制的战争，这在欧洲会非常不受欢迎。此外，联邦军队有了新的士兵：非裔美国人（以前的奴隶——自由人）将大量参军。当然也有一些限制：记住它解放了叛乱地区的奴隶，但北方在南方邦联没有权力。它也不适用于边境州。因此，仍然有大量的奴隶处于奴役状态。但这是战争中的一个重要时刻。

另一个你们应该记住的重要事情是非裔美国人为自由而战。弗雷德里克·道格拉斯和其他北方领导人将加入联邦军队视为证明他们公民身份的机会。对于非裔美国男性来说（你们知道，记得德雷德·斯科特判决曾裁定非裔美国人不是美国公民），对于道格拉斯和其他人来说，这是他们证明和争取公民身份的方式。有超过18万非裔美国人在战争中服役。最著名的当然是马萨诸塞州第54步兵团（正如电影《光荣战役》中所见）。但是，许多许多非裔美国士兵在南北战争期间作战，尽管如此，他们仍然面临着极大的偏见。他们的工资通常低于白人士兵。

你们应该记住的另一个关键点是行政权力的运用。在国家危机时期，公民自由往往会受到限制。因此，当我们审视不同的战争时，请记住：人民的自由是如何受到侵犯的？你们会看到这一点：林肯在马里兰州等边境州中止了人身保护令。人身保护令基本上规定，你有权被告知对你的指控，并且你有权通过审判来证明你的清白。马里兰州等州的人民被剥夺了这项权利，因为在林肯看来，这对于我们国家的安全和维护联邦是必要的。

你们还应该意识到总统权力的这种增长。在战争时期，总统权力往往会增加。例如，林肯在没有国会批准的情况下下令进行封锁（当时国会休会）。林肯说：“我们必须这样做。” 他在没有国会批准的情况下增加了联邦军队的规模。这两件事都是授予国会的权力，但林肯这样做是因为我们处于战争状态，并且他认为这是必要的。

战争政治是你们应该记住的另一件事。你们知道，南方邦联面临着挑战。棉花外交（正如我提到的），他们希望得到欧洲的干预。然而，欧洲从其他来源（例如埃及和印度）获得了棉花。安提耶坦战役的失败（你们知道，罗伯特·E·李试图取得胜利，但没有成功）。结果，此外，1月份的《解放奴隶宣言》——所有这些因素都阻止了欧洲代表南方邦联进行干预。

南方邦联的另一个挑战是州权传统。这使得战争变得困难。南方邦联总统杰斐逊·戴维斯经常发现各州不愿为了南方邦联的利益而派遣军队到其边界之外。林肯也遇到了问题，你们会看到林肯面临的这些挑战来自他自己党内的人。激进共和党人经常批评他在解放奴隶问题上行动过于缓慢。还有战争民主党人（支持战争但批评林肯处理方式的北方民主党人）。当然，还有和平民主党人（以及更激进的被称为“铜头蛇”的人），他们反对战争并希望通过谈判达成和平。

林肯在1864年竞选连任，他击败了前将军（麦克莱伦将军）。他获胜的一个重要原因是联邦开始在亚特兰大等地取得一些胜利。

现在，战争期间发生的一个关键事件（与战斗本身没有太大关系）是国会中共和党占多数。当南方脱离联邦时，他们放弃了在国会的政治权力。因此，北方在没有任何民主党或南方反对派真正阻挠的情况下，得以完成各种各样的事情。

1861年，你们看到了《莫里尔关税法》，该法案通过提高关税率和保护北方工业来帮助支付战争费用。1862年，你们看到了《宅地法》，该法案规定了西部土地的出售并鼓励移民。1862年，你们看到了《法定货币法》，该法案允许印制货币（纸币——绿钞）。《国家银行法》确立了金融健康和福祉，并统一了银行体系。你们还看到了《太平洋铁路法》，该法案为横贯大陆铁路确立了一条北部路线。当然，最重要的是：《解放奴隶宣言》。

快速回顾一下南北战争的影响（有很多很多）。最明显的是巨大的生命损失：超过60万人将在这场残酷的战争中丧生。南方经济将被摧毁，而北方经济（北方工业化）将因战争而加速发展。事实上，在战后时期，你们将看到大规模的工业化主要发生在北方。《宅地法》、《太平洋铁路法》和其他共和党通过的法律将在战后几年产生巨大影响。联邦将被保留（这是战争最初的意义或原因）。而分裂和无效化的思想将被击败。我们一直看到这些事情出现，而南北战争作为未来几代人的选择，彻底粉碎了这种可能性。

也许很多人都忽略了一点：南北战争是对美国民主的终极考验，而它幸存了下来。最后，也是极其重要的：由于战争从一场仅仅关于联邦的战争转变为一场关于奴隶制问题的战争，400万人将突然获得自由。《第十三修正案》将解放400万人。

What up APUSH people. Today we are going to review the Civil War. If you're using any of those APUSH books, those chapters will be reviewed in this video. And it's important to keep in mind that the actual fighting of the Civil War doesn't begin until the attack on Fort Sumter.

But even before that attack, seven Southern States (those states in the blue) had left the union before Lincoln took office in March of 1861. And they leave because of the election of Lincoln and the Republican party on a Free Soil platform. And one of the things Lincoln is very careful not to do is to provoke the other Southern States. In fact, in his inaugural address, he pledges not to interfere with slavery where it already exists. He does tell Southerners (those seven southern states): "You have no right of secession. It doesn't make any sense for you to be doing what you're doing."

And Lincoln's early goals in this initial period is to not let the last two Federal properties be taken over by the Confederacy. And one of those was in the port of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, called Fort Sumter. And Fort Sumter is running out of supplies, and Lincoln tells the Confederacy: "We're sending provisions. We're not sending reinforcements. This is not meant to be an aggressive move." Nonetheless, in April of 1861, the Confederacy attacks Fort Sumter, beginning the fighting of the nation's bloodiest war.

Now the impact of Fort Sumter is huge. One, this unites Northerners behind this idea of preserving the Union. Lincoln calls on volunteers to come fight, and Northerners rally around Lincoln and this idea of fighting the war to preserve the union. The second impact is four more Southern States join the Confederacy (those states in the pink), including the very populated Virginia. And then finally, Lincoln's really kind of priority from the start was keeping the border states from leaving the Union as well.

So what are these border states? These border states are pivotal to the war effort and Lincoln's strategy. The border states are states such as Missouri, Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. And these are slave states that remain in the union (they're green on this map). And Lincoln's goal is to keep them in the union for a couple of reasons. They're super important. Here's why: if those green States left (those border states), it would have given more white men to fight for the Confederacy. A lot of the manufacturing that the South had (what little it did have) was found in the border states. And if they left, it would have nearly doubled the capacity of the South to produce for the war effort. And then finally, geographic location. If States like Maryland and Delaware left the Union, Washington DC (the capital) would be surrounded. They would be closer to the union. So there's a lot of reasons why Lincoln needs to keep these border states in the union side.

And he does so by a variety of methods. He mobilizes the federal government and (in some people's minds) in questionable ways. Martial law is declared in Maryland. Guerilla Warfare takes place in Missouri. And you're going to see the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in some of the border states. We'll get back to that in a moment.

Now both (besides the union and the Confederacy) have advantages and disadvantages when this war begins. For the north, they have the industrial resources. The majority of the manufacturing was in the north (you should know this already). Transportation advantage was the North's as well. The railroad (what railroad was in the nation) was largely in the north. There was a powerful navy. They had an established government (an established federal government was a northern advantage). And then finally, they had the population advantage: 22 million people in the north versus 9 million in the South. And then eventually, when emancipation takes place, that's going to offer advantages as well.

There are disadvantages for our Northern homies. There's a lack of leadership. A lot of the top military leaders join the Confederacy (people like Robert E. Lee). And so the South has those veteran leaders. And then they have a lack of purpose. For a lot of Northerners, it was: "Why are we fighting a war to keep these states that don't want to be in the Union? Let them go, let them go, let them go."

Now the Confederate states have some advantages and disadvantages. For one, the Confederacy is fighting a defensive war. All they have to do is defend their land. And they have the advantage of fighting amongst a friendly population. They have the sense of purpose. They're fighting (in their mind) for the southern way of life, Southern honor. They have (as I mentioned previously) veteran military officials. And those are some of those advantages. And of course, cotton diplomacy. They were really hoping that the importance of cotton to the international market (especially England) would get them foreign recognition and financial assistance. We'll see how that turns out.

The disadvantages were numerous though for the Confederacy. They had no navy, no government structure. In fact, there's a strong sense of independence and state rights. This is going to be hard for the Confederacy to deal with during the war. And you're going to have a very, very poorly equipped Southern society: a weak economy, lack of manufacturing, and no major rail system. So both these sides had advantages and disadvantages, but you had to mobilize for war.

The north passes the first draft (the Conscription Act) in March of 1863. In the union, all men ages 20 to 45 had to register for the draft. Now this was unfair to the poor because if you had money, you could get a substitute (the so-called $300 men who would take your place). And the same thing was kind of done in the South. The South had its equivalent (the so-called 20 negro law) where if you owned more than 20 slaves, you could be exempt from military service. And as a result of this anger over this unfairness, there were riots. In fact, the most famous ones are taking place in July of 1863: the New York City draft riots. Mobs of mostly Irish Americans (who were serving in the Union Army in huge numbers) start attacking the wealthy and also African-Americans because they blame them for this war taking place.

Now important to keep in mind in this chapter is that Lincoln is going to proclaim he was not fighting the war to end slavery. Did you hear that? He wasn't fighting the war to end slavery. And there's a reason why (even though Lincoln personally was against slavery) that he can't say it's about slavery. One, secession was not legal. So therefore in his mind, the South never really left. It was rebels within the southern states that left. Two (and this is the key), the border states. If he makes the war about slavery, those border states are going to say: "Deuces, peace." There's also a fear from white workers in the north what emancipation would mean to them (what that looks like on their end). And then finally, political concerns amongst Northerners. You have Northern Democrats and Northern Republicans all wanting their position represented by Lincoln. But eventually, this war is going to become a war about emancipation.

So how do we get there? Well, there's really two reasons to free the slaves. One is military: if you liberate the slaves, it undermines the economic foundation of the South and it makes it more difficult for them to fight the war. The other is obvious: ideological. It's the right thing to do. And there's pressure on Lincoln to do so amongst Radical Republicans. Radical Republicans (people like Charles Sumner, the guy that got hit over the head with the cane; Thaddeus Stevens; and Benjamin Wade) were pressuring Lincoln to make the war about slavery. They were abolitionists, and they wanted this war to be a war to end slavery. And slowly it becomes that.

In August of 1861, you have the Confiscation Act in which it is declared that slaves used for insurrectionary purposes would be declared free. And this gives runaway slaves an incentive to head north towards Union camps, and that undermines the South's ability to fight the war. In fact, the term "contraband" (make sure you know that) is a term for runaway slaves. In July of 1862, you have the second Confiscation Act which basically said all slaves who were enslaved by anybody engaged in rebellion are free. And so slowly you have this kind of emancipation taking place.

And the big one is the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1st, 1863 (following the Battle of Antietam, which is a union victory - it's technically a draw; Robert E. Lee retreats). Lincoln decides to move forward with announcing the Emancipation Proclamation, and it is justified as a military necessity. It declares slaves free in rebel territory throughout the Confederacy, but it does not free slaves in the border states (very important you know that).

Now the impact: it strengthens the moral cause of the north. It gives the north a sense of moral purpose. This is not just a war against secession; it's against slavery. It also helps keep Europe from aiding the Confederacy (especially England) because if they do so, they're fighting a war to defend slavery, and that would be very unpopular over in Europe. Also, new soldiers for the Union Army: African-American men (former slaves - the freedmen) are going to sign up in huge numbers. There's also some limits: keep in mind it freed the slaves in rebel territory, but the North had no authority in the Confederacy. It also did not apply to the border states. So there's still a huge number of slaves still in bondage. But it's an important moment in the war.

Another important thing you should keep in mind is the African-American fight for freedom. Frederick Douglass and other leaders of the north saw enlistment in the Union Army as an opportunity to prove their citizenship. For African-American men (you know, remember Dred Scott's decision had said African-Americans are not citizens of the United States), and for Douglass and others, this was their way to prove it and fight for it. You have over 180,000 African-Americans serving in the war. The most famous, of course, is the Massachusetts 54th Regiment (as seen in the movie Glory). But many, many African-American soldiers fought during the Civil War, but nonetheless face a great deal of prejudice. They were often times paid less than white soldiers.

Another key thing you should keep in mind is the use of executive power. Civil liberties are often times reduced during times of national crisis. So as we look at different wars, keep in mind: how are people's liberty being infringed upon? And you see this: Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in border states such as Maryland. And the writ of habeas corpus basically says that you have the right to be informed of the charges against you, and you have a right to prove your innocence by having a trial. This was denied to people in States like Maryland because in Lincoln's mind, this was necessary for our nation's security and to preserve the union.

There's also this kind of increase in presidential power you should be aware of. Often times, presidential power increases during times of war. And for instance, Lincoln ordered a blockade without the approval of Congress (Congress was not in session). Lincoln said: "We got to do it." He increases the size of the federal army without the approval of Congress. Both those things are powers granted to Congress, but Lincoln does it because we are at war and feels it is necessary.

Politics of the war is another thing you should keep in mind. You know, there are challenges for the Confederacy. Cotton diplomacy (as I mentioned), they were hoping that they would get European intervention. Europe though obtained cotton from other sources (for example, Egypt and India). And the failure at Antietam (you know, Robert E. Lee was trying to get a win, doesn't get one). And as a result, in addition, the Emancipation Proclamation in January - all of those factors prevent European intervention on behalf of the Confederacy.

The other challenge for the Confederacy is the tradition of state rights. It makes fighting the war difficult. Jefferson Davis (the president of the Confederacy) oftentimes found states reluctant to send troops outside of their borders on behalf of the Confederacy. Lincoln had problems as well, and those challenges for Lincoln you'll see were amongst people within his own party. Very often, the Radical Republicans criticize him for moving too slow on the issue of emancipation. And you had War Democrats (Northern Democrats who support the war but criticize Lincoln's handling of it). And of course, there were also Peace Democrats (and the more radical ones called Copperheads) who opposed the war and wanted a negotiated peace.

Lincoln does run for re-election in 1864, and he does beat his former General (General McClellan). And one of the big reasons he wins that is because the union starts winning some victories in places like Atlanta.

Now one of the key things that happens during the war (and it has nothing really significant about the battles) was there were Republican majority in Congress. When the South leaves the union, they forfeit their right to political power in Congress. So you get the north getting all sorts of things done without any Democrat or Southern opposition to really block it.

In 1861, you get the Morrill Tariff which helps pay for the war by increasing the tariff rates and protecting Northern industry. You get the Homestead Act in 1862 which sets up the sale of land in the west and encourages settlement. In 1862, you get the Legal Tender Act which allows for the printing of money (paper money - the greenbacks). The National Bank Act establishes the financial health and well-being and unifies the banking system. And you also get the Pacific Railway Act which establishes a northern route for the transcontinental railroad. And of course, the big one: the Emancipation Proclamation.

Real quick rundown of the impact of the Civil War (and there's a whole bunch of them). The most obvious one is the enormous loss of life: over 600,000 people are going to die from the fighting in this brutal war. The Southern economy is going to be destroyed, and the northern economy (Northern industrialization) is going to be accelerated by the war. In fact, in the post-war period, you're going to see a mass industrialization take place largely in the north. The Republican laws that are going to be passed are going to have a huge impact in the post-war years (especially the Homestead Act, the Pacific Railroad Act, and others). The union is going to be preserved (that's what the initial meaning or reason for the war was). And the idea of secession and nullification is going to be defeated. We kept seeing those things come up, and the Civil War kind of crushes that as an option for future generations.

And probably something that's really lost for a lot of people is: the Civil War was the ultimate test for American democracy, and it survives. And then lastly, enormously important: 4 million people are going to be suddenly freed as a result of the war as the war changes from one just about the union to one about the issue of slavery. The 13th Amendment is going to emancipate 4 million individuals.
