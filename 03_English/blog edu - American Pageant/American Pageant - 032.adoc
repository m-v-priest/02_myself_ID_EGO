== 释义

What's going down 怎么回事, beautiful APUSH people? Today we're taking a look at the Great Depression 大萧条 and even more importantly the New Deal 新政.

So in 1932 there is an election for the presidency 总统选举, and the Republican Party 共和党 is running Herbert Hoover 赫伯特·胡佛. He's running for a second term 谋求连任. He had the unfortunate luck of being the president when the stock market crashes 股市崩盘 in October 1929. And for the early part of the depression, Hoover favored rugged individualism 坚定的个人主义. He did not want the federal government 联邦政府 to give direct relief 直接救济. He does eventually support the Reconstruction Finance Corporation 复兴金融公司 based on a trickle-down theory of economics 涓滴经济学理论.

And the Democrats 民主党 though pick Franklin Roosevelt 富兰克林·罗斯福. He promises the American people a New Deal. There is no clear plan laid out 制定；规划 -- no one exactly knows nor does he what he's going to do if elected. But in 1932 the unemployment rate 失业率 is 25%, and there was a growing frustration 日益增长的不满 with the limited response under Hoover and the federal government's failure to address the needs of the American people 未能满足美国人民的需求. And this brings Franklin Roosevelt the victory 胜利.

So who is this guy Franklin Roosevelt -- FDR? Roosevelt comes from a wealthy, privileged family 富裕、优越的家庭. He is a distant cousin of Theodore Roosevelt 西奥多·罗斯福. He came up in New York politics 涉足纽约政坛. He was the governor of New York 纽约州州长 in 1928. But important to keep in mind is before that occurred, polio 脊髓灰质炎 had left Roosevelt paralyzed from the waist down 腰部以下瘫痪. And he could not walk unaided 无人辅助地；独立地 -- he needed braces 支架 and crutches 拐杖. And very often in private he used a wheelchair 轮椅.

It's important you also know about Eleanor Roosevelt 埃莉诺·罗斯福 -- the wifey 妻子. She will recreate the position of first lady 重塑第一夫人的角色. She's a very active first lady, and she is going to be a very vocal advocate 积极发声的倡导者 for various underserved groups 服务不足的群体 including African-Americans and women.

Roosevelt is not going to come up with 提出 his policies on his own. In fact there were a group of advisers 顾问 -- very diverse group of people 多元化的人群 -- known as The Brain Trust 智囊团. And many of these were very intelligent university professors who will help him as he develops his New Deal programs 新政计划. And as you could see, Secretary of Labor 劳工部长 Frances Perkins 弗朗西斯·珀金斯 is one of these members of his cabinet 内阁 and will be the first woman in the presidential cabinet 总统内阁中的首位女性.

Now what is this New Deal? Well it's important to keep in mind it was not an organized or pre-planned set of programs 有组织或预先计划好的一系列项目. A lot of it was based upon experimentation 基于实验. And in effect 实际上 the New Deal is nothing more than the laws and programs and agencies 法律、项目和机构 created by the federal government. And what made the New Deal so popular amongst many Americans was its willingness to experiment 愿意尝试的态度.

The New Deal is characterized by 以……为特点 the three Rs -- make sure you know these: relief 救济 for the people who are struggling from the impact of the Great Depression 受大萧条影响而苦苦挣扎的人们, recovery 复苏 to get the economy back on track 使经济重回正轨, and then reform 改革 so that this economic crisis would never happen again 防止此类经济危机再次发生.

Roosevelt takes office 就职 in March of 1933. At his inauguration 就职典礼 he famously says, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." The New Deal is going to be oftentimes referred to as the alphabet agencies 字母机构 because the programs are going to be known by their various letters 以其不同的字母缩写而闻名. And Roosevelt is going to use the power of the radio -- he's going to give many fireside chats 炉边谈话 where he uses the radio to communicate directly to the American people 直接与美国民众交流.

And upon taking office you have this period known as the first 100 days 百日新政. This starts on March 4th, 1933. Congress 国会 at the request of President Roosevelt passes a huge number of laws designed to deal with the Great Depression 旨在应对大萧条的大量法律 -- more laws than in any other period in Congress's history 比国会历史上任何时期都多.

And one of the first areas that Roosevelt wants to address 解决 is the area of banking and finance 银行与金融领域. In fact well into 1933 many banks were failing 倒闭. Depositors 储户 had no trust in the banks and they were quickly withdrawing their funds 提取资金, causing thousands of banks to fail. So in March of 1933 Roosevelt wants to stop this panic 恐慌 and he declares -- he calls for a bank holiday 银行休业日. He wants to close the banks and restore the confidence of the American people 恢复美国民众的信心. He explains his actions in the fireside chat on March 12th in 1933.

And Congress passes the Emergency Banking Relief Act 紧急银行救济法案 which basically said only banks that were financially stable 财务稳定的 could reopen. So the government is going to check them and once they're deemed stable 被认为稳定 they would be allowed to reopen.

Another law passed in the first 100 days dealing with finance and banking is the Glass-Steagall Act 格拉斯 - 斯蒂格尔法案. This is going to be intended to regulate banks 监管银行. In fact it restricted how banks could invest a customer's deposits 限制银行对客户存款的投资方式. And the intention of this is to stop that speculation 投机行为 that banks were taking part in in the 1920s. Glass-Steagall Act also establishes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 联邦存款保险公司 -- more commonly known as FDIC -- which says that banks that belong to FDIC, the deposits made would be insured 投保；承保 and up to $2,500 back in 1933 is guaranteed by the federal government 由联邦政府担保.

And later on in the New Deal another law is passed called the Securities and Exchange Commission 证券交易委员会 where the government would regulate the stock market 监管股票市场. And it's really intended to stop that speculation that led to the crash 导致崩盘的投机行为. The government would watch over the stock market 监管股票市场 -- they would audit 审计 and hopefully eliminate fraud 消除欺诈行为.

Another part of the first 100 days was intended to deal with the unemployment problem and provide relief 应对失业问题并提供救济. In 1933 millions of people remained unemployed -- roughly 25%. And the New Deal created jobs to provide relief to the unemployed 为失业者创造就业机会. And the idea was there was the hope that this job creation would provide relief and also lead to recovery as people had some money in their pocket they would start spending it and the economy would jump start 刺激经济复苏.

So during the first 100 days you get the Federal Emergency Relief Act 联邦紧急救济法案. This is headed by Harry Hopkins 由哈里·霍普金斯领导 and the federal government gave money to states and local governments so that they could provide relief services 提供救济服务 such as running of soup kitchens 施粥所.

Another program is the Civilian Conservation Corps 民间资源保护队 -- the CCC. This program employed jobless young men 雇佣失业的年轻人 in reforestation projects 植树造林项目, park maintenance 公园维护 and other kind of conservation roles 保护工作. These young men would live on government-run camps 政府运营的营地, and the idea would be they would be doing these important jobs while also sending money home to their families 寄钱回家.

And then you also have the PWA -- the Public Works Administration 公共工程管理局 -- in which federal money would be sent to state and local government for public works projects 公共工程项目. So this money would be used to build things like roads, bridges, dams and other public works 公共设施.

Another aspect of the first 100 days is industrial and agricultural recovery 工业和农业复苏. Remember one of the big problems was overproduction 生产过剩. To deal with this the National Recovery Act 全国工业复兴法 -- the NRA -- was created headed by Hugh Johnson 由休·约翰逊领导. And its job was one to produce industrial recovery 促进工业复苏 and two to allow for fair wages and hours for workers 保障工人的公平工资和工时. To do this the federal government and business drafted codes for industries 为各行业制定法规. And these codes for example would set production limits 生产限额 so they could limit the possibility of overproduction. There would be codes for wages and hours worked. And there was a special section 7A in the NRA which allowed workers to form unions 成立工会 -- so no more yellow dog contracts 黄狗契约（指以不加入工会为雇佣条件的契约） -- and this is one of the first instances of the federal government guaranteeing the rights of workers to form and join unions 保障工人成立和加入工会的权利.

Another important program deals with agriculture -- this is the Agricultural Adjustment Act 农业调整法 -- the AAA. This paid farmers to cut production 付钱给农民以减少产量. So you want to kind of limit production so that prices could increase 提高价格. And the government would pay farmers -- farmers would receive subsidies payments 补贴金 in return for cutting production. So both the NRA and the AAA are trying to stimulate recovery in the economy 刺激经济复苏.

It's important to note -- we're going to cover this in just a moment -- both of these acts will be ruled unconstitutional 被判定违宪 by the Supreme Court 最高法院.

Keep in mind there was also something called the Dust Bowl 沙尘碗事件 going on at this time -- horrible drought 严重干旱 in the 1930s added to the farmers' problems on the Great Plains 大平原地区农民的问题. And you have a number of states such as Oklahoma having these severe dust storms 严重沙尘暴 known as the Dust Bowl. And really this is the result of overuse of the land 土地过度使用 and high winds causing these dust storms. And thousands of "Okies" as they were derogatorily called 被贬称地称为 逃离到 places like California looking for work and a fresh start 寻找工作和新的开始. And this is documented in the famous book The Grapes of Wrath 愤怒的葡萄 by John Steinbeck 约翰·斯坦贝克 which talks about one family's journey from Oklahoma trying to start over 讲述一个家庭从俄克拉荷马州重新开始的历程.

Another program in the first 100 days you should know about is the Tennessee Valley Authority 田纳西河流域管理局 -- the TVA. And this is really a government agency 政府机构 which built dams 水坝, electric power plants 发电厂 and attempted to control flooding and erosion 控制洪水和水土流失 in this Tennessee Valley area 田纳西河流域. And it's as you can see on the map -- it's not just in Tennessee but a whole area of the country that was very poor and without electricity 贫困且无电力供应. And this is a huge change from previous policies since the TVA was the federal government helping develop a region 帮助发展一个地区 and selling electricity at very reduced rates 以极低的价格出售电力. And this TVA gave thousands of people jobs and developed this poor region by providing hydroelectric power 水电.

It's important to note that in the first couple years of the New Deal, the primary focus was on recovery 复苏. And there was some success -- the unemployment rate was dropping, there was some recovery taking place in some industries 一些行业出现复苏迹象. But there still needed to be more done. And starting in 1935 the Second New Deal 第二次新政 goes further with reform and direct relief 进一步推进改革和直接救济.

And you can really see that with the Works Progress Administration 公共事业振兴署 -- the WPA. The WPA spent billions of dollars 花费数十亿美元 -- the federal government is employing millions of unemployed workers 雇佣数百万失业工人. And under the WPA, instead of unemployed people getting relief from the local and state government, this time it's the federal government and workers are building roads, bridges and other public works projects 公共工程项目. The WPA also employs artists, writers, painters, actors, photographers under subprograms 子项目 such as the Federal Writers Project 联邦作家项目, the Federal Arts Project 联邦艺术项目 and even the National Youth Administration 全国青年管理局 for young people.

Another program under the Second New Deal is the Resettlement Administration 重新安置管理局. This provided assistance -- really loans 贷款 -- to sharecroppers 佃农, tenant farmers 佃户 and other small farmers that were left out of assistance in the First New Deal 第一次新政中未得到援助的小农户. And if you recall, the AAA actually paid farmers to take land out of production 让农民休耕土地 and this hurt non-land owning farmers 伤害了无地农民. So the Resettlement Administration seeks to address the plight of those individuals 解决这些人的困境.

One of the most important programs of the New Deal is going to be Social Security 社会保障. And the Social Security Act of 1935 1935年社会保障法案 would have the greatest impact on future generations 对后代产生最重大影响. Reason being the Social Security Act established the principle of federal responsibility for social welfare 联邦政府对社会福利负责的原则. Here's what it does: money would be taken out from the payroll of employees and employers 从雇员和雇主的工资中扣除, and people over the age of 65 and above would receive money pensions 养老金 upon retirement under Social Security. Others were eligible for assistance 有资格获得援助 such as mothers with dependent children 有未成年子女的母亲, unemployment insurance 失业保险 for those individuals who lost their jobs, or for the disabled 残疾人. And this is a huge program still around today and it provides a safety net 安全保障 for those individuals who need assistance 需要帮助的人.

Another important program of the Second New Deal is the National Labor Relations Act 全国劳动关系法 or the Wagner Act 瓦格纳法案. The Wagner Act guaranteed the rights of organized labor 有组织的劳工的权利. It protected the right to join a union 加入工会的权利 and to bargain collectively 集体谈判的权利. And this is a huge change because it is the first time that the federal government is protecting the rights of workers to form unions 保护工人成立工会的权利. It creates the National Labor Relations Board 全国劳动关系委员会 to enforce the labor laws 执行劳动法. And what you're going to see is after 1935 a huge boost to the labor movement 劳工运动的巨大推动. You're going to have the rise of the CIO 产业工会联合会 under John L. Lewis 约翰·L·刘易斯. You're going to have the sit-down strikes 静坐罢工 in General Motors 通用汽车公司. And labor union membership 工会会员人数 is going to increase.

There were challenges to the New Deal 对新政的挑战. And it's important to note that by 1936 the New Deal did improve the economy but it still remained unstable 不稳定. In spite of these limitations to the New Deal, Roosevelt remained enormously popular 非常受欢迎. He easily crushes Alfred Landon 击败阿尔弗雷德·兰登 in the election of 1936.

But still there were critics of Roosevelt and the New Deal 对罗斯福和新政的批评者. One of the most vocal critics 最直言不讳的批评者 were conservatives 保守派 and business owners 企业主. They tended to dislike Roosevelt's New Deal programs 不喜欢罗斯福的新政计划. Couple reasons why: they did not like the increase of government regulation 政府监管的增加 and the increase in the size of the federal government 联邦政府规模的扩大. And they were very critical of deficit spending 赤字支出.

For Roosevelt and his Brain Trust, they justified these policies 为这些政策辩护 because they were following the policies of British economist John Maynard Keynes 英国经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯. And Keynesian economics 凯恩斯经济学 says deficit spending was needed during times of economic crisis 经济危机时期 to stimulate economic growth 刺激经济增长. So you're going to jump start the economy by spending money and running these deficits 通过花钱和产生赤字来刺激经济.

There were some liberal critics of the New Deal 新政的自由派批评者. They felt that the New Deal was not doing enough for minority communities 少数族裔群体 and the poor. And you get the rise of various demagogues 煽动者 who are challenging Roosevelt and the New Deal 挑战罗斯福和新政. Two of the big ones is Dr. Francis Townsend 弗朗西斯·汤森德博士. Actually before the Social Security Act is passed, Townsend's plan said that every person over the age of 60 would receive $200 a month 每月200美元, and that money would have to be spent immediately which would then stimulate the economy while also providing assistance for the elderly 刺激经济并为老年人提供帮助.

And the other big guy is the senator from Louisiana Huey Long 路易斯安那州参议员休伊·朗 who advocated for the program Share Our Wealth 均富计划. This program's slogan 口号 was "Every Man a King" and what it would do would tax the wealth 对富人征税 and give that money to the poor 把钱分给穷人. So it was a redistribution of money 财富再分配. And he had a lot of followers 追随者. But unfortunately for Long he will be assassinated 被暗杀.

In Roosevelt's mind one of the biggest threats to his New Deal 对新政的最大威胁之一 was the Supreme Court 最高法院. So a little background on the court packing plan 法院改组计划: remember the Supreme Court ruled two key New Deal programs unconstitutional 判定两项关键的新政计划违宪. They also ruled some others but the two that you should know about is the National Recovery Act ruled unconstitutional in 1935 and the Agricultural Adjustment Act 农业调整法.

And Roosevelt decides that he is going to propose a plan that would allow him to appoint additional judges 任命额外的法官. And under his plan for every judge over the age of 70, Roosevelt would be able to appoint an additional judge. So the Supreme Court would go from nine to 15 judges 从九名法官增加到十五名. Critics accuse him of trying to pack the court 指责他试图操纵法院. This is seen as his court packing plan 法院改组计划 because it's very clear Roosevelt wants to put people in the Supreme Court who will support his New Deal policies.

There's a huge amount of opposition from both Republicans and Democrats as they see Roosevelt's court packing plan as an assault on the principle of checks and balances 制衡原则. And Roosevelt suffers a rare political defeat 遭受罕见的政治失败 over this issue of the Supreme Court.

And finally some impacts that are important to know about. One is the change that happens politically 政治上的变化. The New Deal Democratic Coalition 新政民主党联盟 of farmers, urban immigrants 城市移民, union members 工会成员, African - Americans and women -- the Democratic Party gets a lot of support because of its New Deal programs from these different groups 因为其新政计划而从这些不同群体获得大量支持. And key is the change of voting patterns 投票模式的变化 amongst African - Americans. All the way back until Lincoln, African - Americans tended to support the Republican Party 支持共和党. This changes under Franklin Roosevelt because of his New Deal policies 因为他的新政政策而改变.

The New Deal established the federal responsibility for society 确立了联邦政府对社会的责任. It created the safety net -- the welfare state 福利国家. And in spite of the numerous programs 众多项目, the New Deal does not end the Great Depression 结束大萧条. It would not be until World War II that the Great Depression will finally end. But it does provide huge amount of relief to numerous people throughout the 1930s 但它确实在20世纪30年代为众多民众提供了大量救济.

There continues to be a debate about deficit spending 赤字支出 and the creation of the welfare state 福利国家的建立 and the growth of the federal government 联邦政府的扩张. So it opens up these discussions that will not go away 引发了持续不断的讨论. In fact in 1937 a recession takes place 发生经济衰退 -- the so - called Roosevelt Recession 所谓的罗斯福衰退 -- when reduced government spending on public works 公共工程支出减少 and reduction in relief programs 救济项目削减 causes the economy to decline 导致经济下滑. And remember the idea of Keynesian economics -- the government's spending helps promote economic growth 政府支出有助于促进经济增长. Following the recession in 1937, Roosevelt continues the spending and that boosts the economy back up 使经济回升.

And it's important to note that the New Deal is going to have a limited impact on racial and gender issues 种族和性别问题. Roosevelt for example did nothing on the very huge problem of lynching 私刑问题. And the reason being is he did not want to jeopardize support for his New Deal programs 危及对他新政计划的支持 by coming out in favor of an anti - lynching law 支持反私刑法案. He knew if he did that he would lose the support among Southern Democrats 失去南方民主党人的支持. So when it came to issues of civil rights 民权问题, Roosevelt was a disappointment 令人失望.

APUSH的同学们，大家好！今天我们要探讨大萧条，更重要的是新政。

1932年举行了总统选举，共和党推选赫伯特·胡佛竞选连任。他不走运地在1929年10月股市崩盘时担任总统。在萧条的早期，胡佛倾向于坚韧的个人主义。他不希望联邦政府提供直接救济。他最终确实支持了基于涓滴经济学理论的复兴金融公司。

然而，民主党人选择了富兰克林·罗斯福。他向美国人民承诺了一项“新政”。当时并没有明确的计划——没有人确切知道，他自己也不知道当选后会做什么。但在1932年，失业率高达25%，人们对胡佛政府有限的应对以及联邦政府未能满足美国人民的需求越来越感到沮丧。这为富兰克林·罗斯福带来了胜利。

那么，富兰克林·罗斯福——FDR——到底是谁？罗斯福出身于富裕的特权家庭。他是西奥多·罗斯福的远房堂兄。他在纽约政界崭露头角，1928年担任纽约州州长。但重要的是要记住，在此之前，小儿麻痹症导致罗斯福腰部以下瘫痪。他无法独立行走——需要支具和拐杖。在私下场合，他经常使用轮椅。

了解埃莉诺·罗斯福——他的妻子——也很重要。她将重塑第一夫人的角色。她是一位非常活跃的第一夫人，并且将成为包括非裔美国人和妇女在内的各种弱势群体的直言不讳的倡导者。

罗斯福并非独自制定他的政策。事实上，有一群顾问——一个非常多元化的人群——被称为“智囊团”。其中许多是非常聪明的大学教授，他们将在他制定新政计划时帮助他。正如你们所见，劳工部长弗朗西斯·珀金斯是内阁成员之一，并将成为第一位进入总统内阁的女性。

那么，什么是新政？重要的是要记住，这不是一套有组织或预先计划好的方案。很多都是基于实验。实际上，新政只不过是联邦政府创建的法律、计划和机构。新政在许多美国人中如此受欢迎的原因在于其愿意进行实验。

新政的特点是“3R”——务必记住这三点：救济（Relief），为那些因大萧条影响而挣扎的人们提供帮助；复苏（Recovery），使经济重回正轨；改革（Reform），以防止再次发生这种经济危机。

罗斯福于1933年3月就职。在他的就职演说中，他著名地说：“我们唯一需要恐惧的就是恐惧本身。”新政通常被称为“字母机构”，因为这些计划都以各种字母缩写而闻名。罗斯福将利用广播的力量——他将进行多次“炉边谈话”，通过广播直接与美国人民沟通。

就职后，出现了一个被称为“百日新政”的时期。这始于1933年3月4日。在罗斯福总统的要求下，国会通过了大量旨在应对大萧条的法律——比国会历史上任何其他时期都多。

罗斯福想要解决的首要领域之一是银行和金融领域。事实上，直到1933年，许多银行仍在倒闭。储户对银行没有信任，他们迅速提取资金，导致数千家银行倒闭。因此，在1933年3月，罗斯福想要阻止这种恐慌，他宣布——他呼吁实行银行假日。他想关闭银行并恢复美国人民的信心。他在1933年3月12日的炉边谈话中解释了他的行动。

国会通过了《紧急银行法案》，该法案基本上规定只有财务稳定的银行才能重新开业。因此，政府将对它们进行检查，一旦被认为稳定，它们将被允许重新开业。

百日新政期间通过的另一项处理金融和银行业的法律是《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》。该法案旨在监管银行。事实上，它限制了银行如何投资客户的存款。其目的是阻止银行在1920年代参与的那种投机行为。《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》还设立了联邦存款保险公司——更通俗地称为FDIC——该机构规定，凡属于FDIC的银行，其存款都将受到保险，早在1933年，联邦政府就保证最高2500美元的存款。

在新政后期，又通过了一项名为《证券交易委员会法案》的法律，政府将监管股市。这实际上是为了阻止导致股市崩盘的投机行为。政府将监督股市——他们将进行审计，并希望消除欺诈行为。

百日新政的另一个部分旨在解决失业问题并提供救济。1933年，数百万人仍然失业——大约25%。新政创造了就业机会，为失业者提供救济。其想法是，创造就业机会有望提供救济，并随着人们口袋里有了一些钱开始消费，经济也将开始复苏。

因此，在百日新政期间，你们看到了《联邦紧急救济法案》。该法案由哈里·霍普金斯领导，联邦政府向州和地方政府提供资金，以便他们能够提供救济服务，例如运营救济厨房。

另一个计划是民间资源保护队（CCC）。该计划雇用失业青年从事植树造林项目、公园维护和其他类型的自然资源保护工作。这些年轻人将住在政府运营的营地里，其想法是他们将从事这些重要的工作，同时还将钱寄回家给家人。

然后你们还有公共工程管理局（PWA），联邦资金将拨给州和地方政府用于公共工程项目。这笔钱将用于修建道路、桥梁、水坝和其他公共工程。

百日新政的另一个方面是工业和农业的复苏。记住，当时的一个大问题是生产过剩。为了解决这个问题，成立了由休·约翰逊领导的国家复兴管理局（NRA）。其职责一是促进工业复苏，二是允许工人获得公平的工资和工时。为此，联邦政府和企业为各行业起草了法规。例如，这些法规将设定生产限额，以便限制生产过剩的可能性。法规还将规定工资和工时。NRA中有一个特别的7A条款，允许工人组建工会——不再有“黄狗合同”——这是联邦政府首次保障工人组建和加入工会权利的案例之一。

另一个重要的计划涉及农业——这就是农业调整法案（AAA）。该法案向农民支付报酬以削减产量。因此，你们想要限制产量，以便价格能够上涨。政府将向农民支付报酬——农民将因削减产量而获得补贴。因此，NRA和AAA都在试图刺激经济复苏。

重要的是要注意——我们稍后会讨论这个问题——这两项法案都将被最高法院裁定为违宪。

记住，当时还发生了所谓的“沙尘暴”——1930年代可怕的干旱加剧了大平原农民的问题。你们看到俄克拉荷马州等许多州都遭受了被称为“沙尘暴”的严重沙尘暴。这实际上是过度使用土地和强风导致这些沙尘暴的结果。成千上万被贬称为“俄克佬”的人逃往加利福尼亚等地寻找工作和新的开始。约翰·斯坦贝克著名的《愤怒的葡萄》一书记录了这一切，该书讲述了一个家庭从俄克拉荷马州出发试图重新开始的故事。

百日新政中你们应该了解的另一个计划是田纳西河流域管理局（TVA）。这实际上是一个政府机构，它修建水坝、发电厂，并试图控制田纳西河流域的洪水和侵蚀。正如你们在地图上看到的——它不仅在田纳西州，而且覆盖了全国一个非常贫穷且没有电力的广大地区。这与之前的政策相比是一个巨大的变化，因为TVA是联邦政府帮助开发一个地区并以非常低的利率出售电力。TVA为成千上万的人提供了就业机会，并通过提供水力发电开发了这个贫困地区。

重要的是要注意，在新政的最初几年，主要重点是复苏。取得了一些成功——失业率下降了，一些行业出现了一些复苏。但仍然需要做更多的工作。从1935年开始，第二次新政在改革和直接救济方面走得更远。

你们可以在工程进展管理局（WPA）中真正看到这一点。WPA花费了数十亿美元——联邦政府雇用了数百万失业工人。在WPA的领导下，失业人员不再从地方和州政府获得救济，这次是联邦政府直接提供，工人们修建道路、桥梁和其他公共工程项目。WPA还通过联邦作家项目、联邦艺术项目甚至国家青年管理局等子项目雇用艺术家、作家、画家、演员和摄影师。

第二次新政下的另一个计划是移民安置管理局。该机构向佃农、分成农和其他在第一次新政中被排除在援助之外的小农户提供援助——实际上是贷款。如果你们还记得，农业调整法案实际上是向农民支付报酬以减少耕地面积，这损害了非土地所有者的农民。因此，移民安置管理局试图解决这些人的困境。

新政最重要的计划之一将是社会保障。1935年的《社会保障法》将对后代产生最大的影响。原因在于，《社会保障法》确立了联邦政府对社会福利的责任原则。具体做法是：从雇员和雇主的工资中提取资金，65岁及以上的人在退休后将根据社会保障获得养老金。其他人也有资格获得援助，例如有受抚养子女的母亲、失业人员的失业保险或残疾人援助。这是一个至今仍在实施的庞大计划，它为那些需要帮助的人提供了安全保障。

第二次新政的另一个重要计划是《国家劳工关系法》，又称《瓦格纳法案》。《瓦格纳法案》保障了有组织劳工的权利。它保护了加入工会和集体谈判的权利。这是一个巨大的变化，因为这是联邦政府首次保护工人组建工会的权利。它设立了国家劳工关系委员会来执行劳工法。你们将看到，在1935年之后，劳工运动得到了巨大的推动。在约翰·L·刘易斯的领导下，产业工会联合会（CIO）兴起。你们将看到通用汽车的静坐罢工。工会会员人数将增加。

新政面临着挑战。重要的是要注意，到1936年，新政确实改善了经济，但经济仍然不稳定。尽管新政存在这些局限性，但罗斯福仍然非常受欢迎。他在1936年的选举中轻松击败了阿尔弗雷德·兰登。

但仍然有人批评罗斯福和新政。最直言不讳的批评者之一是保守派和企业主。他们往往不喜欢罗斯福的新政计划。原因有几个：他们不喜欢政府监管的增加和联邦政府规模的扩大。他们非常批评赤字开支。

对于罗斯福和他的智囊团来说，他们为这些政策辩护是因为他们遵循了英国经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯的政策。凯恩斯主义经济学认为，在经济危机时期需要赤字开支来刺激经济增长。因此，你们将通过花钱和制造赤字来启动经济。

一些自由主义者也批评新政。他们认为新政对少数族裔和穷人的帮助不够。各种蛊惑人心的政客开始挑战罗斯福和新政。其中两位是弗朗西斯·汤森博士。实际上，在《社会保障法》通过之前，汤森的计划规定，所有60岁以上的人每月将获得200美元，这笔钱必须立即花掉，这样既能刺激经济，又能为老年人提供援助。

另一位重要人物是路易斯安那州参议员休伊·朗，他倡导“分享财富”计划。该计划的口号是“人人为王”，其做法是对财富征税并将这笔钱分配给穷人。这是一种财富再分配。他有很多追随者。但不幸的是，朗将被暗杀。

在罗斯福看来，对他新政的最大威胁之一是最高法院。关于“法院改组计划”的背景：记住，最高法院裁定两项关键的新政计划违宪。他们还裁定了其他一些，但你们应该知道的是1935年裁定《国家复兴法案》违宪和《农业调整法案》违宪。

罗斯福决定提出一项允许他任命更多法官的计划。根据他的计划，每位70岁以上的法官，罗斯福将能够任命一名额外的法官。因此，最高法院将从九名法官增加到十五名法官。批评者指责他试图“塞满”法院。这被称为他的“法院改组计划”，因为很明显罗斯福希望将支持他的新政政策的人安插到最高法院。

共和党人和民主党人都对此表示强烈反对，他们认为罗斯福的“法院改组计划”是对三权分立原则的攻击。罗斯福在这个最高法院问题上遭受了一次罕见的政治失败。

最后，一些重要的影响需要了解。一是政治上的变化。由农民、城市移民、工会成员、非裔美国人和妇女组成的新政民主联盟——民主党因其新政计划从这些不同群体中获得了大量支持。关键是非裔美国人投票模式的变化。一直到林肯时期，非裔美国人倾向于支持共和党。由于富兰克林·罗斯福的新政政策，这种情况发生了改变。

新政确立了联邦政府对社会的责任。它建立了社会保障体系——福利国家。尽管实施了众多计划，但新政并未结束大萧条。直到第二次世界大战，大萧条才最终结束。但它确实在1930年代为众多人提供了大量的救济。

关于赤字开支、福利国家的建立和联邦政府的扩张，一直存在争论。因此，它引发了这些不会消失的讨论。事实上，1937年发生了一次经济衰退——所谓的“罗斯福衰退”——当时政府削减了公共工程开支并减少了救济计划，导致经济下滑。记住凯恩斯主义经济学的观点——政府支出有助于促进经济增长。在1937年的衰退之后，罗斯福继续支出，这推动了经济的回升。

重要的是要注意，新政对种族和性别问题的影响有限。例如，罗斯福对非常严重的私刑问题没有任何作为。原因是，他不想通过公开支持反私刑法来损害他对新政计划的支持。他知道，如果这样做，他将失去南方民主党人的支持。因此，在民权问题上，罗斯福令人失望。

What's going down, beautiful APUSH people? Today we're taking a look at the Great Depression and even more importantly the New Deal.

So in 1932 there is an election for the presidency, and the Republican Party is running Herbert Hoover. He's running for a second term. He had the unfortunate luck of being the president when the stock market crashes in October 1929. And for the early part of the depression, Hoover favored rugged individualism. He did not want the federal government to give direct relief. He does eventually support the Reconstruction Finance Corporation based on a trickle-down theory of economics.

And the Democrats though pick Franklin Roosevelt. He promises the American people a New Deal. There is no clear plan laid out -- no one exactly knows nor does he what he's going to do if elected. But in 1932 the unemployment rate is 25%, and there was a growing frustration with the limited response under Hoover and the federal government's failure to address the needs of the American people. And this brings Franklin Roosevelt the victory.

So who is this guy Franklin Roosevelt -- FDR? Roosevelt comes from a wealthy, privileged family. He is a distant cousin of Theodore Roosevelt. He came up in New York politics. He was the governor of New York in 1928. But important to keep in mind is before that occurred, polio had left Roosevelt paralyzed from the waist down. And he could not walk unaided -- he needed braces and crutches. And very often in private he used a wheelchair.

It's important you also know about Eleanor Roosevelt -- the wifey. She will recreate the position of first lady. She's a very active first lady, and she is going to be a very vocal advocate for various underserved groups including African-Americans and women.

Roosevelt is not going to come up with his policies on his own. In fact there were a group of advisers -- very diverse group of people -- known as The Brain Trust. And many of these were very intelligent university professors who will help him as he develops his New Deal programs. And as you could see, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins is one of these members of his cabinet and will be the first woman in the presidential cabinet.

Now what is this New Deal? Well it's important to keep in mind it was not an organized or pre-planned set of programs. A lot of it was based upon experimentation. And in effect the New Deal is nothing more than the laws and programs and agencies created by the federal government. And what made the New Deal so popular amongst many Americans was its willingness to experiment.

The New Deal is characterized by the three Rs -- make sure you know these: relief for the people who are struggling from the impact of the Great Depression, recovery to get the economy back on track, and then reform so that this economic crisis would never happen again.

Roosevelt takes office in March of 1933. At his inauguration he famously says, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." The New Deal is going to be oftentimes referred to as the alphabet agencies because the programs are going to be known by their various letters. And Roosevelt is going to use the power of the radio -- he's going to give many fireside chats where he uses the radio to communicate directly to the American people.

And upon taking office you have this period known as the first 100 days. This starts on March 4th, 1933. Congress at the request of President Roosevelt passes a huge number of laws designed to deal with the Great Depression -- more laws than in any other period in Congress's history.

And one of the first areas that Roosevelt wants to address is the area of banking and finance. In fact well into 1933 many banks were failing. Depositors had no trust in the banks and they were quickly withdrawing their funds, causing thousands of banks to fail. So in March of 1933 Roosevelt wants to stop this panic and he declares -- he calls for a bank holiday. He wants to close the banks and restore the confidence of the American people. He explains his actions in the fireside chat on March 12th in 1933.

And Congress passes the Emergency Banking Relief Act which basically said only banks that were financially stable could reopen. So the government is going to check them and once they're deemed stable they would be allowed to reopen.

Another law passed in the first 100 days dealing with finance and banking is the Glass-Steagall Act. This is going to be intended to regulate banks. In fact it restricted how banks could invest a customer's deposits. And the intention of this is to stop that speculation that banks were taking part in in the 1920s. Glass-Steagall Act also establishes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- more commonly known as FDIC -- which says that banks that belong to FDIC, the deposits made would be insured and up to $2,500 back in 1933 is guaranteed by the federal government.

And later on in the New Deal another law is passed called the Securities and Exchange Commission where the government would regulate the stock market. And it's really intended to stop that speculation that led to the crash. The government would watch over the stock market -- they would audit and hopefully eliminate fraud.

Another part of the first 100 days was intended to deal with the unemployment problem and provide relief. In 1933 millions of people remained unemployed -- roughly 25%. And the New Deal created jobs to provide relief to the unemployed. And the idea was there was the hope that this job creation would provide relief and also lead to recovery as people had some money in their pocket they would start spending it and the economy would jump start.

So during the first 100 days you get the Federal Emergency Relief Act. This is headed by Harry Hopkins and the federal government gave money to states and local governments so that they could provide relief services such as running of soup kitchens.

Another program is the Civilian Conservation Corps -- the CCC. This program employed jobless young men in reforestation projects, park maintenance and other kind of conservation roles. These young men would live on government-run camps, and the idea would be they would be doing these important jobs while also sending money home to their families.

And then you also have the PWA -- the Public Works Administration -- in which federal money would be sent to state and local government for public works projects. So this money would be used to build things like roads, bridges, dams and other public works.

Another aspect of the first 100 days is industrial and agricultural recovery. Remember one of the big problems was overproduction. To deal with this the National Recovery Act -- the NRA -- was created headed by Hugh Johnson. And its job was one to produce industrial recovery and two to allow for fair wages and hours for workers. To do this the federal government and business drafted codes for industries. And these codes for example would set production limits so they could limit the possibility of overproduction. There would be codes for wages and hours worked. And there was a special section 7A in the NRA which allowed workers to form unions -- so no more yellow dog contracts -- and this is one of the first instances of the federal government guaranteeing the rights of workers to form and join unions.

Another important program deals with agriculture -- this is the Agricultural Adjustment Act -- the AAA. This paid farmers to cut production. So you want to kind of limit production so that prices could increase. And the government would pay farmers -- farmers would receive subsidies payments in return for cutting production. So both the NRA and the AAA are trying to stimulate recovery in the economy.

It's important to note -- we're going to cover this in just a moment -- both of these acts will be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

Keep in mind there was also something called the Dust Bowl going on at this time -- horrible drought in the 1930s added to the farmers' problems on the Great Plains. And you have a number of states such as Oklahoma having these severe dust storms known as the Dust Bowl. And really this is the result of overuse of the land and high winds causing these dust storms. And thousands of "Okies" as they were derogatorily called fled to places like California looking for work and a fresh start. And this is documented in the famous book The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck which talks about one family's journey from Oklahoma trying to start over.

Another program in the first 100 days you should know about is the Tennessee Valley Authority -- the TVA. And this is really a government agency which built dams, electric power plants and attempted to control flooding and erosion in this Tennessee Valley area. And it's as you can see on the map -- it's not just in Tennessee but a whole area of the country that was very poor and without electricity. And this is a huge change from previous policies since the TVA was the federal government helping develop a region and selling electricity at very reduced rates. And this TVA gave thousands of people jobs and developed this poor region by providing hydroelectric power.

It's important to note that in the first couple years of the New Deal, the primary focus was on recovery. And there was some success -- the unemployment rate was dropping, there was some recovery taking place in some industries. But there still needed to be more done. And starting in 1935 the Second New Deal goes further with reform and direct relief.

And you can really see that with the Works Progress Administration -- the WPA. The WPA spent billions of dollars -- the federal government is employing millions of unemployed workers. And under the WPA, instead of unemployed people getting relief from the local and state government, this time it's the federal government and workers are building roads, bridges and other public works projects. The WPA also employs artists, writers, painters, actors, photographers under subprograms such as the Federal Writers Project, the Federal Arts Project and even the National Youth Administration for young people.

Another program under the Second New Deal is the Resettlement Administration. This provided assistance -- really loans -- to sharecroppers, tenant farmers and other small farmers that were left out of assistance in the First New Deal. And if you recall, the AAA actually paid farmers to take land out of production and this hurt non-land owning farmers. So the Resettlement Administration seeks to address the plight of those individuals.

One of the most important programs of the New Deal is going to be Social Security. And the Social Security Act of 1935 would have the greatest impact on future generations. Reason being the Social Security Act established the principle of federal responsibility for social welfare. Here's what it does: money would be taken out from the payroll of employees and employers, and people over the age of 65 and above would receive money pensions upon retirement under Social Security. Others were eligible for assistance such as mothers with dependent children, unemployment insurance for those individuals who lost their jobs, or for the disabled. And this is a huge program still around today and it provides a safety net for those individuals who need assistance.

Another important program of the Second New Deal is the National Labor Relations Act or the Wagner Act. The Wagner Act guaranteed the rights of organized labor. It protected the right to join a union and to bargain collectively. And this is a huge change because it is the first time that the federal government is protecting the rights of workers to form unions. It creates the National Labor Relations Board to enforce the labor laws. And what you're going to see is after 1935 a huge boost to the labor movement. You're going to have the rise of the CIO under John L. Lewis. You're going to have the sit-down strikes in General Motors. And labor union membership is going to increase.

There were challenges to the New Deal. And it's important to note that by 1936 the New Deal did improve the economy but it still remained unstable. In spite of these limitations to the New Deal, Roosevelt remained enormously popular. He easily crushes Alfred Landon in the election of 1936.

But still there were critics of Roosevelt and the New Deal. One of the most vocal critics were conservatives and business owners. They tended to dislike Roosevelt's New Deal programs. Couple reasons why: they did not like the increase of government regulation and the increase in the size of the federal government. And they were very critical of deficit spending.

For Roosevelt and his Brain Trust, they justified these policies because they were following the policies of British economist John Maynard Keynes. And Keynesian economics says deficit spending was needed during times of economic crisis to stimulate economic growth. So you're going to jump start the economy by spending money and running these deficits.

There were some liberal critics of the New Deal. They felt that the New Deal was not doing enough for minority communities and the poor. And you get the rise of various demagogues who are challenging Roosevelt and the New Deal. Two of the big ones is Dr. Francis Townsend. Actually before the Social Security Act is passed, Townsend's plan said that every person over the age of 60 would receive $200 a month, and that money would have to be spent immediately which would then stimulate the economy while also providing assistance for the elderly.

And the other big guy is the senator from Louisiana Huey Long who advocated for the program Share Our Wealth. This program's slogan was "Every Man a King" and what it would do would tax the wealth and give that money to the poor. So it was a redistribution of money. And he had a lot of followers. But unfortunately for Long he will be assassinated.

In Roosevelt's mind one of the biggest threats to his New Deal was the Supreme Court. So a little background on the court packing plan: remember the Supreme Court ruled two key New Deal programs unconstitutional. They also ruled some others but the two that you should know about is the National Recovery Act ruled unconstitutional in 1935 and the Agricultural Adjustment Act.

And Roosevelt decides that he is going to propose a plan that would allow him to appoint additional judges. And under his plan for every judge over the age of 70, Roosevelt would be able to appoint an additional judge. So the Supreme Court would go from nine to 15 judges. Critics accuse him of trying to pack the court. This is seen as his court packing plan because it's very clear Roosevelt wants to put people in the Supreme Court who will support his New Deal policies.

There's a huge amount of opposition from both Republicans and Democrats as they see Roosevelt's court packing plan as an assault on the principle of checks and balances. And Roosevelt suffers a rare political defeat over this issue of the Supreme Court.

And finally some impacts that are important to know about. One is the change that happens politically. The New Deal Democratic Coalition of farmers, urban immigrants, union members, African-Americans and women -- the Democratic Party gets a lot of support because of its New Deal programs from these different groups. And key is the change of voting patterns amongst African-Americans. All the way back until Lincoln, African-Americans tended to support the Republican Party. This changes under Franklin Roosevelt because of his New Deal policies.

The New Deal established the federal responsibility for society. It created the safety net -- the welfare state. And in spite of the numerous programs, the New Deal does not end the Great Depression. It would not be until World War II that the Great Depression will finally end. But it does provide huge amount of relief to numerous people throughout the 1930s.

There continues to be a debate about deficit spending and the creation of the welfare state and the growth of the federal government. So it opens up these discussions that will not go away. In fact in 1937 a recession takes place -- the so-called Roosevelt Recession -- when reduced government spending on public works and reduction in relief programs causes the economy to decline. And remember the idea of Keynesian economics -- the government's spending helps promote economic growth. Following the recession in 1937, Roosevelt continues the spending and that boosts the economy back up.

And it's important to note that the New Deal is going to have a limited impact on racial and gender issues. Roosevelt for example did nothing on the very huge problem of lynching. And the reason being is he did not want to jeopardize support for his New Deal programs by coming out in favor of an anti-lynching law. He knew if he did that he would lose the support among Southern Democrats. So when it came to issues of civil rights, Roosevelt was a disappointment.
