all right all right all right, today we
are going to be taking a look at the
administrations 行政当局 of John Tyler and James
K. Polk, roughly covering the period 1840 to
1848. if you're reading any of those
American history books, this lecture is
going to help you out.

so we start with
the election of 1840 - remember there's
that whole "Tippecanoe and Tyler too" slogan 口号. the
Whigs 辉格党 pick William Henry Harrison as
their candidate (the war hero from Tippecanoe)
and his vice president is actually a
former Democrat by the name of John
Tyler. because of some personal beef
不和 with Andrew Jackson, he leaves the
Democrat Party and joins the Whig ticket
in 1840. they win with that cool slogan "Tippecanoe
and Tyler too."

unfortunately
for your homeboy William Henry Harrison,
after just 32 days in office he dies - gives a
super long inaugural address 就职演说 and just
dies. shortest term president ever. now the
problem is William Henry Harrison is now
dead (the first president to die while in office)
in 1841, and the Whig party starts having
beef with the new president John Tyler.

so the vice president becomes president,
but he holds many Democrat beliefs - he's
a Jacksonian 杰克逊主义者 at heart, states' rights 州权 kind
of guy, and he starts causing all sorts
of problems for the Whig party because he
blocks some of their goals. for example:

- he vetoes 否决 a bill to re-up the national
bank
- he puts a bill in place to end the
Independent Treasury System 独立国库制度
and the Whig
party (especially people like Henry Clay
and Daniel Webster) are all angry. his entire
cabinet 内阁 resigns. now Tyler is a man without
a party - the Whigs don't want him, the Democrats don't want him.

he tries to build a following by annexing
吞并 Texas (remember Andrew Jackson had
recognized the Lone Star Republic 孤星共和国, but Martin
Van Buren and Jackson were not
interested in bringing up that controversy
争议 of trying to annex Texas). Tyler does it,
but is defeated by Whigs in Congress - they
don't want any more slave states added
to the union.

so in 1844, Tyler basically is out -
no one wants him. the dark horse
黑马 candidate is James K. Polk - he comes out
of nowhere, running against the
political veteran Henry Clay under the
Whig party, and Polk wins.

now Polk has some key issues he brings up in the election:

1. the annexation of Texas (he wants to do it, and it's going to happen in 1845)
2. lowering the tariff 关税 (he's a Democrat; the Whigs favor higher tariffs; he's also from the South)
3. Manifest Destiny 天定命运论 and national expansion (with specific targets: Oregon and California)

here's what goes down with Texas:
Polk wants to annex Texas, talks about it
during the campaign as a goal that would
benefit the entire nation. but it's
actually lame duck 跛脚鸭 President John Tyler
who submits a treaty just as he's about
to leave office. he does this by a
joint resolution 联合决议 (because under a joint
resolution through Congress, you only
need a majority, not the two-thirds approval of
the Senate, which is the normal route
that most annexation treaties take). so
Tyler annexes Texas just before Polk
takes office.

but Polk has some goals of his own:

1. he wants to lower the tariff (accomplished with the Walker Tariff of 1846)
2. Manifest Destiny and national expansion (with specific targets):
   - Oregon ("54°40' or fight!")
   - California

it's worth taking a look at this idea of Manifest Destiny:

- it's the belief that it was America's
destiny to conquer and civilize the
entire continent from the east coast to
the West Coast
- there's a certain level of built-in white
superiority belief 白人优越论 in this idea - that the continent/the people on it
are not civilized, and that Americans are
the ones to conquer it and bring
civilization to the entire continent
- it ignores that there are Native
Americans there, and Mexico, and England
and other groups
- the term "Manifest Destiny" was
first coined by John O'Sullivan in 1845
(a newspaper editor)
but it's important to keep in mind western expansion
had been going on for a very long time.
if you really want to get technical,
from the moment the colonies are founded
back in 1607 and onward, we've been moving West.
and with that comes problems. we've seen this even
in the early nation's history:
- 1803: the Louisiana Purchase 路易斯安那购地 under Thomas Jefferson (brings up issues like Missouri entering the Union)
- the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协案
- Jackson's Indian Removal policies 印第安人迁移政策 in the 1830s
these are all examples of the United States moving
West and occupying new land. but what happens
in the 1840s is the issue of slavery is
going to complicate western expansion
more and more frequently. the 1820
compromise resolved it, but it's going to pop back up.

let's talk about one of the
non-controversial (at least when it comes
to the issue of slavery) moments of
expansion under Polk: the Oregon dispute.
during the campaign of 1844, Polk had openly said "54°40' or fight!"
(the boundary of the United States
was going to be at that point on the map).
if you recall, under the Anglo-American
Convention 英美公约 of 1818, the US and England
had agreed to jointly occupy Oregon
Territory. now what ends up
happening is more and more Americans are
coming into the area along the Oregon
Trail 俄勒冈小道 (making that over 2,000-mile journey),
and it's a major issue in the election of 1844.

well, there is no fight - there is no "54°40'" - because under
the Oregon Treaty of 1846, England agrees
to give up its claim to that territory,
and the boundary between the United
States and Canada will be the 49th
parallel (you see on the map). England
agrees to do this partly because
they are guaranteed fishing
rights in Vancouver Island. so there is a
peaceful resolution to this dispute.

however, there won't be one with our beef
with Mexico. what ends up happening is:

- Mexico still viewed Texas as part of Mexico (they don't recognize the Lone Star Republic)
- Santa Anna is very clear on this issue
- they also have an issue with the boundary (is it the Rio Grande or the Nueces River?)

Polk attempts to buy California from Mexico,
but because of the whole Texas issue, the
relations between the two countries is
strained. he sends his envoy 特使 John Slidell
to Mexico trying to buy California for $25 million,
and basically Mexico refuses to even
consider the offer. Polk then sends Zachary
Taylor into the disputed territory
between Mexico and Texas, and US forces
are attacked in April of 1846,
ultimately leading to the Mexican-American War
美墨战争 (which will last a little under two years).

now what's important to keep in mind is this war
is very controversial, especially amongst:

- Northern Whigs
- some Northern Democrats
they oppose the war because:
- they see it as an attempt by Southerners to extend slavery into new territories
- they question whether the attack actually happened on American soil (Abraham Lincoln introduces the "spot resolutions" 现场决议案 challenging Polk's assertion)
- in 1846, David Wilmot (from Pennsylvania) proposes the Wilmot Proviso 威尔莫特附文, which would ban slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico
  * it passes the House (Northerners have a numbers advantage)
  * but is rejected by the Senate

Southerners view these protests from the North with increasing suspicion, seeing Northerners as trying to attack or prevent their Southern way of life.

while the war does take place, it is horrible
for Mexico - they lose most of the major
battles, and it ends with the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo 瓜达卢佩-伊达尔戈条约 in 1848. the treaty does several things:

1. US territory increases by one-third
2. US gets California, New Mexico, and the rest of the Southwest (Arizona, Utah, Nevada, etc.)
3. Mexico gives up its claims to Texas and accepts the Rio Grande as the border

for Mexico this is devastating - about half of Mexican
territory is taken. this creates:

- a huge strain on US-Mexico relations
- new problems for the US, as these new territories force the slavery issue back into national politics

that's the summary of Tyler and Polk (covering chapter 17 for the
American Pageant and some of those other
chapters). hopefully you learned some stuff
and you're going to get that 5 on
that APUSH exam. if you haven't already
done so, make sure you subscribe to Joe's Productions (it's free!). if the video helped you out at all, click like and post
a comment ("thanks bro," "thanks man, appreciate it"). y'all have a wonderful day. peace.

好的，各位APUSH的同学们，今天我们要探讨约翰·泰勒和詹姆斯·K·波尔克的执政时期，大致涵盖1840年至1848年。如果你正在阅读任何一本美国历史书籍，这次讲座将对你有所帮助。

我们从1840年的选举开始——记住那个著名的口号“蒂珀卡努和泰勒也一样”。辉格党推选威廉·亨利·哈里森（蒂珀卡努的战争英雄）为他们的候选人，而他的副总统实际上是一位名叫约翰·泰勒的前民主党人。由于与安德鲁·杰克逊的一些个人恩怨，他离开了民主党，并在1840年加入了辉格党的竞选阵容。他们凭借那个酷炫的口号“蒂珀卡努和泰勒也一样”赢得了选举。

不幸的是，对于你们的朋友威廉·亨利·哈里森来说，他在任仅32天后就去世了——发表了一篇超级长的就职演说，然后就去世了。他是历史上任期最短的总统。现在的问题是，威廉·亨利·哈里森在1841年去世了（第一位在任期间去世的总统），而辉格党开始与新总统约翰·泰勒产生矛盾。

因此，副总统成为了总统，但他持有许多民主党的信念——他骨子里是一个杰克逊主义者，一个州权主义者，他开始给辉格党制造各种各样的问题，因为他阻碍了他们的一些目标。例如：

他否决了一项旨在重新设立国家银行的法案。
他提出了一项旨在结束独立财政体系的法案。 而辉格党（尤其是像亨利·克莱和丹尼尔·韦伯斯特这样的人）都非常生气。他的整个内阁都辞职了。现在泰勒成了一个没有政党的人——辉格党不想要他，民主党也不想要他。
他试图通过吞并德克萨斯来建立自己的追随者（记住安德鲁·杰克逊承认了孤星共和国，但马丁·范布伦和杰克逊对引发吞并德克萨斯这一争议不感兴趣）。泰勒做了，但被国会中的辉格党击败了——他们不希望更多的蓄奴州加入联邦。

因此，在1844年，泰勒基本上出局了——没有人想要他。黑马候选人是詹姆斯·K·波尔克——他横空出世，与辉格党的政治老将亨利·克莱竞争，波尔克获胜。

现在，波尔克在选举中提出了一些关键问题：

吞并德克萨斯（他想这样做，这将在1845年发生）。
降低关税（他是一个民主党人；辉格党赞成更高的关税；他也来自南方）。
昭昭天命和国家扩张（目标明确：俄勒冈和加利福尼亚）。
以下是德克萨斯的情况：
波尔克想吞并德克萨斯，在竞选期间谈到这一点，认为这是一个将使整个国家受益的目标。但实际上是即将卸任的跛脚鸭总统约翰·泰勒提交了一项条约。他通过一项联合决议来做到这一点（因为根据国会的联合决议，你只需要多数票，而不是参议院通常的批准条约所需的三分之二票）。因此，泰勒在波尔克上任前吞并了德克萨斯。

但波尔克有自己的目标：

他想降低关税（通过1846年的沃克关税实现）。
昭昭天命和国家扩张（目标明确）：
俄勒冈（“五十四度四十分，否则就开战！”）
加利福尼亚
值得一看“昭昭天命”这个概念：

这是一种信念，认为美国注定要征服和文明化整个大陆，从东海岸到西海岸。
这种思想中存在一定程度的白人优越论——认为这片大陆/其上的人民没有被文明化，而美国人是征服它并将文明带到整个大陆的人。
它忽略了那里有美洲原住民、墨西哥、英国和其他群体。
“昭昭天命”这个词最早由约翰·奥沙利文（一位报纸编辑）在1845年提出。 但重要的是要记住，西进运动已经持续了很长时间。如果你真的想较真，从1607年殖民地建立的那一刻起，我们就一直在向西迁移。随之而来的是问题。我们在早期国家的历史上就看到了这一点：
1803年：托马斯·杰斐逊领导下的路易斯安那购地（引发了密苏里加入联邦等问题）。
密苏里妥协案。
1830年代杰克逊的印第安人迁移政策。 这些都是美国向西扩张并占领新土地的例子。但在1840年代，奴隶制问题将越来越频繁地使西进运动复杂化。1820年的妥协案解决了这个问题，但它将再次出现。
让我们谈谈波尔克领导下扩张中一个非争议性（至少在奴隶制问题上）的时刻：俄勒冈争端。在1844年的竞选期间，波尔克公开表示“五十四度四十分，否则就开战！”（美国的边界将是地图上的那个点）。如果你还记得，根据1818年的《英美公约》，美国和英国同意共同占领俄勒冈领地。结果是，越来越多的美国人沿着俄勒冈小道来到该地区（进行了超过2000英里的旅程），这是1844年选举中的一个主要问题。

好吧，没有战斗——没有“五十四度四十分”——因为根据1846年的《俄勒冈条约》，英国同意放弃其对该领土的主张，美国和加拿大之间的边界将是北纬49度（你在地图上看到的那条线）。英国同意这样做，部分原因是他们获得了温哥华岛的捕鱼权。因此，这场争端得到了和平解决。

然而，我们与墨西哥的冲突就不会如此和平了。结果是：

墨西哥仍然认为德克萨斯是墨西哥的一部分（他们不承认孤星共和国）。
桑塔·安纳在这个问题上非常明确。
他们在边界问题上也存在争议（是格兰德河还是努埃塞斯河？）。
波尔克试图从墨西哥购买加利福尼亚，但由于整个德克萨斯问题，两国关系紧张。他派遣他的特使约翰·斯莱德尔前往墨西哥，试图以2500万美元的价格购买加利福尼亚，但基本上墨西哥甚至拒绝考虑这一提议。波尔克随后派遣扎卡里·泰勒进入墨西哥和德克萨斯之间的争议地区，美国军队于1846年4月遭到袭击，最终导致了美墨战争（这场战争持续了不到两年）。

现在，重要的是要记住，这场战争极具争议，尤其是在以下群体中：

北方辉格党人。
一些北方民主党人。 他们反对这场战争，因为：
他们认为这是南方人试图将奴隶制扩展到新领土的企图。
他们质疑袭击是否真的发生在美国领土上（亚伯拉罕·林肯提出了“定点决议”，质疑波尔克的断言）。
1846年，来自宾夕法尼亚州的戴维·威尔莫特提出了威尔莫特但书，该但书将禁止在从墨西哥获得的任何领土上实行奴隶制。
它在众议院获得通过（北方人在人数上占优势）。
但被参议院否决。
南方人越来越怀疑地看待北方这些抗议活动，认为北方人试图攻击或阻止他们的南方生活方式。

战争确实发生了，这对墨西哥来说是可怕的——他们输掉了大部分主要战役，战争以1848年的《瓜达卢佩-伊达尔戈条约》结束。该条约做了以下几件事：

美国领土增加三分之一。
美国获得了加利福尼亚、新墨西哥和西南部的其余地区（亚利桑那州、犹他州、内华达州等）。
墨西哥放弃了对德克萨斯的主张，并承认格兰德河为边界。
这对墨西哥来说是毁灭性的——大约一半的墨西哥领土被夺走。这造成了：

美墨关系的巨大紧张。
美国的新问题，因为这些新领土迫使奴隶制问题重新回到国家政治中。
这就是泰勒和波尔克的总结（涵盖了《美国纪事》第17章和一些其他章节）。希望你学到了一些东西，并且你将在APUSH考试中获得5分。如果你还没有这样做，请务必订阅乔氏出品（它是免费的！）。如果这个视频对你有任何帮助，请点赞并发表评论（“谢谢兄弟”，“谢谢老兄，感谢你”）。祝大家有个美好的一天。再见。
