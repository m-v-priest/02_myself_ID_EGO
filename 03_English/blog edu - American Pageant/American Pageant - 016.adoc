All right, all right, all right. + 
 Today we are going to be taking a look at the administrations 行政部门；政府 of John Tyler and James K. + 
 Polk, roughly the period 1840 to 1848. + 
 If you're reading any of those American history books, this lecture is going to help you out. + 


So we start with the election of 1840. + 
 Remember there's that whole "Tippecanoe and Tyler too. + 
" The Whigs 辉格党（美国历史上的政党）pick William Henry Harrison as their candidate 候选人 - the war hero from Tippecanoe - and his vice president is actually a former Democrat by the name of John Tyler. + 
 And because of some personal beef 争执；恩怨 with Andrew Jackson, he leaves the Democrat Party and joins the Whig ticket 候选人名单 in 1840. + 
 They win, got a cool slogan: "Tippecanoe and Tyler too. + 
"

And unfortunately for your homeboy William Henry Harrison, after 32 days in office 执政；任职 he dies - gives a super long inaugural address 就职演说 and just dies. + 
 Shortest term president ever. + 
 Now the problem is William Henry Harrison is now dead - the first president to die while in office, 1841 - and the Whig Party starts having beef with the new president John Tyler. + 


So the vice president becomes president, but he holds many Democrat beliefs. + 
 He's a Jacksonian 杰克逊主义者（支持安德鲁·杰克逊政治理念的人）at heart, states' rights kind of guy, and he starts causing all sorts of problems for the Whig Party because he blocks some of their goals. + 
 For example, he vetoes 否决 a bill to, uh, re-up the national bank. + 
 He puts a bill in place to end the Independent Treasury System 独立国库制度. + 
 And the Whig Party, especially people like Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, are all angry. + 
 His entire cabinet 内阁 resigns. + 


Now Tyler - a man without kind of a party. + 
 Uh, the Whigs don't want him, the Democrats don't want him. + 
 He tries to build a following by annexing 兼并；吞并 Texas. + 
 Remember Andrew Jackson had recognized the Lone Star Republic 孤星共和国（得克萨斯共和国别称）. + 
 Martin Van Buren though and Jackson were not interested in bringing up that controversy 争议 of trying to annex Texas. + 
 Tyler does it, is defeated by Whigs in Congress - they don't want any more slave states added to the union 联邦. + 


So in 1844, Tyler basically is out. + 
 No one wants him. + 
 The dark horse 黑马（意外胜出的候选人）candidate is James K. Polk. +
 He comes out of nowhere. + 
 He's running against the political veteran 资深政治家 Henry Clay under the Whig Party, and Polk wins. + 
 Now Polk - one of the issues he brings up in the election is the annexation 兼并；吞并 of Texas. + 
 He wants to do it, and it's going to happen in 1845. + 


Now here's what goes down: Polk wants to annex Texas, talks about it during the campaign 竞选活动 as a goal that would benefit the entire nation. + 
 But it's actually lame duck 即将卸任的 President John Tyler who submits 提交 a treaty just as he's about to leave office. + 
 And he does this by a joint resolution 联合决议（案） because under a joint resolution through Congress you only need a majority 多数, not the two-thirds approval of the Senate which is the normal route 途径 that most annexation treaties take. + 
 So Tyler annexes Texas just before Polk takes office. + 


But Polk has some goals of his own: one, he wants to lower the tariff 关税 - he's a Democrat, the Whigs kind of favor the higher tariffs. + 
 He's also from the South - he wants to lower that bad boy. + 
 Two, a big thing - Manifest Destiny 天定命运论, national expansion 扩张. + 
 And he has some places in mind - Oregon. + 
 During the campaign he talks about "54-40 or fight" - he's going to take that from England. + 
 He's going to annex Texas (Tyler kind of preempts 抢先；预先采取行动 that and does it first), and he also wants to acquire 获得；取得 California. + 


And it's worth taking a look at this idea of manifest destiny. + 
 It's a basic belief that it was America's destiny to conquer 征服 and civilize 使文明 the entire continent from the east coast to the West Coast. + 
 And in this there is a certain level of, uh, built-in, uh, white superiority 优越；优势 belief in this idea - idea that the continent, the people that are on it are not civilized and that we are the ones to conquer it and to bring civilization to the entire continent. + 
 It's ignoring that there are Native Americans there, in Mexico and England and other, uh, groups. + 


The term Manifest Destiny was first coined 创造；杜撰 by John O'Sullivan in 1845, a newspaper editor. + 
 But it's important to keep in mind western expansion 扩张 had been going on for a very long time. + 
 If you really want to get technical, from the moment the colonies, you know, are founded back in 1607 and onward, we've been moving West. + 
 And with that comes problems. + 
 But we've seen this even in the early nation's history - 1803 we have the Louisiana Purchase 路易斯安那购地案 under Thomas Jefferson that brings up issues such as the Missouri entering the Union. + 
 We have the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协案. + 
 Jackson's Indian Removal policies 政策 in the 1830s. + 
 These are all examples of the United States moving West, occupying 占领 new land. + 
 But what happens in the 1840s is the issue of slavery is going to complicate 使复杂化 western expansion more and more frequently. + 
 So in 1820 that compromise resolved 解决 it, but it's going to pop back up. + 


Let's talk about one of the non-controversial 无争议的, at least when it comes to the issue of slavery, uh, moments of expansion under Polk and that is the Oregon dispute 争端. + 
 During the campaign of 1844, Polk had openly said "54-40 or fight" - the boundary 边界 of the United States, uh, is going to be at that point on the map. + 
 And if you recall under the Anglo-American Convention 公约 of 1818, the US and England had agreed to jointly occupy 占领 Oregon Territory with England. + 


Now what ends up happening is more and more Americans are coming into the area along the Oregon Trail 俄勒冈小道 - they're making that over 2,000 mile journey - and it's a major issue in the election of 1844. + 
 Polk's laying it out there - we're going to get this territory 领土. + 
 Well, there is no fight. + 
 There is no 54-40 because under the Oregon Treaty of 1846, England agrees to give up its claim 所有权；权利要求 to that territory and the boundary between the United States and Canada will be the 49th parallel 纬线 you see on the map. + 
 Now England does agree, uh, to do this because partly they are guaranteed 保证 fishing rights in Vancouver Island. + 
 So there is a peaceful resolution 解决办法 to this dispute. + 


However, there won't be one with our beef with Mexico. + 
 And what ends up happening is if you recall, Mexico still viewed Texas as part of Mexico. + 
 In fact they don't recognize this Lone Star Republic. + 
 Santa Anna is very clear on this issue. + 
 And they also have an issue with the boundary - you know, is it the Rio Grande 格兰德河 or is it the Nueces River 努埃塞斯河?

Well, Polk attempts to buy California from Mexico. + 
 Because of the whole Texas issue, the relations between the two countries is strained 紧张的. + 
 And you have his boy John Slidell going to Mexico trying to buy it, uh, California for $25 million. + 
 And basically Mexico refuses to even consider the offer. + 
 Polk sends in Zachary Taylor into the disputed territory between Mexico and Texas, and US forces are attacked in April of 1846, ultimately leading to the Mexican-American War 美墨战争 which will last a little under two years. + 


Now what's important to keep in mind is this war which ends is very very controversial 有争议的, especially amongst Northerners. + 
 Northern Whigs and even some Northern Democrats oppose 反对 the war. + 
 They see it as an attempt by Southerners to extend 扩展 slavery into new territories. + 
 And they question - especially Abraham Lincoln, a young congressman 国会议员 from the north, uh, he introduces the spot resolution 地点决议（案）. + 
 He basically says, "Yo Polk, show us if this was actually an attack on American soil," and he's challenging the president's assertion 断言 that we were actually attacked on American soil. + 


You saw the controversy further when David Wilmot from, I believe, Pennsylvania tries to put something forward called the Wilmot Proviso 威尔莫特但书 which basically would have said, "Hey, we're going to ban slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico," um, as a result of this war. + 
 Now this is in 1846 - they haven't even won the war but they're pretty confident. + 
 It passes the House 众议院 'cause Northerners have a number advantage, but it is rejected by the Senate 参议院. + 
 And what's important is Southerners view these, these uh, protests 抗议 from the north with increasing suspicion 怀疑 - Northerners are trying to attack or prevent our Southern way of life. + 


While the war does take place, it is horrible for Mexico. + 
 They lose most of the major battles. + 
 And it ends with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo 瓜达卢佩 - 伊达尔戈条约 in 1848. + 
 And it does a number of things: basically the United States' territory increases by one-third. + 
 The United States is given California, New Mexico, and the rest of the Southwest which includes places like Arizona, Utah, Nevada and so on. + 
 The United States also gets Mexico to agree to give up its claims to Texas. + 
 And they do agree to accept the Rio Grande as the border 边界 between the two nations. + 


For Mexico this is devastating 毁灭性的 - about half of Mexican territory is taken. + 
 And this is going to create a huge strain 压力；紧张关系 on the relationship between these two countries. + 
 And more importantly than that for APUSH is this is going to create new problems because as these new territories are added to the union, it's going to force the issue of slavery back into the center of national politics. + 


That's the summary of Tyler and Polk in chapter 17 for the American Pageant and some of those other chapters. + 
 Hopefully you learn some stuff and you're going to get that five on that APUSH exam. + 
 If you haven't already done so, make sure you subscribe to Joe Production - it's on sale today, you can do it for free. + 
 And if it helped you out the video at all, click like and post a comment - say "Thanks bro," "Thanks man," appreciate it. + 
 And uh, you all have a wonderful day. + 
 Peace. +

好的，好的，好的。今天我们要来看一看约翰·泰勒和詹姆斯·K·波尔克的执政时期，大致是从1840年到1848年。如果你正在阅读任何一本美国历史书，这次讲座会对你有所帮助。

我们从1840年的选举开始。记住，当时有句口号“蒂珀卡努和泰勒也一样”。辉格党推选威廉·亨利·哈里森为他们的候选人——蒂珀卡努的战争英雄——而他的副总统实际上是一位名叫约翰·泰勒的前民主党人。由于与安德鲁·杰克逊的一些个人恩怨，他离开了民主党，并在1840年加入了辉格党的竞选阵容。他们赢了，他们的口号很酷：“蒂珀卡努和泰勒也一样。”

不幸的是，对于你们的朋友威廉·亨利·哈里森来说，他在任32天后就去世了——发表了一篇超级长的就职演说然后就死了。他是任期最短的总统。现在的问题是威廉·亨利·哈里森去世了——他是第一位在任期间去世的总统，1841年——而辉格党开始与新总统约翰·泰勒产生矛盾。

因此，副总统成为了总统，但他持有许多民主党的信念。他骨子里是个杰克逊主义者，一个州权至上的人，他开始给辉格党制造各种各样的问题，因为他阻止了他们的一些目标。例如，他否决了一项关于重新建立国家银行的法案。他提出了一项旨在结束独立财政系统的法案。辉格党，特别是像亨利·克莱和丹尼尔·韦伯斯特这样的人，都非常生气。他的整个内阁都辞职了。

现在是泰勒——一个没有自己党派的人。辉格党不想要他，民主党也不想要他。他试图通过吞并德克萨斯来建立自己的追随者。记住，安德鲁·杰克逊承认了孤星共和国。然而，马丁·范布伦和杰克逊对挑起吞并德克萨斯这个争议不感兴趣。泰勒做了，但在国会被辉格党击败了——他们不希望再有更多的蓄奴州加入联邦。

所以在1844年，泰勒基本上出局了。没有人想要他。黑马候选人是詹姆斯·K·波尔克。他横空出世。他与辉格党的老牌政治家亨利·克莱竞争，波尔克获胜了。现在，波尔克在选举中提出的一个问题是吞并德克萨斯。他想这样做，这件事将在1845年发生。

现在事情是这样的：波尔克想要吞并德克萨斯，在竞选期间将其作为一项将使整个国家受益的目标来谈论。但实际上是即将卸任的跛脚鸭总统约翰·泰勒在他即将离任时提交了一份条约。他通过一项联合决议来做到这一点，因为根据国会的联合决议，你只需要多数票，而不是参议院通常需要的批准条约的三分之二票。所以泰勒在波尔克就职前吞并了德克萨斯。

但波尔克有他自己的目标：一是降低关税——他是个民主党人，辉格党倾向于更高的关税。他也是南方人——他想降低那个糟糕的东西。二是件大事——昭昭天命，国家扩张。他心里有一些地方——俄勒冈。在竞选期间，他谈到“五十四度四十分，否则就开战”——他要从英国手中夺取它。他要吞并德克萨斯（泰勒有点抢先一步做了），他还想获得加利福尼亚。

值得一看的是昭昭天命这个概念。这是一种基本的信念，即美国注定要征服和文明整个大陆，从东海岸到西海岸。其中包含着某种程度的、固有的白人优越感——认为这片大陆及其上的人民是不文明的，而我们才是征服它并将文明带到整个大陆的人。这忽略了那里有美洲原住民、墨西哥人和英国人以及其他群体。

“昭昭天命”这个词最早是由报纸编辑约翰·奥沙利文在1845年提出的。但重要的是要记住，西进运动已经进行了很长时间。如果你真的想从技术角度来说，从1607年殖民地建立的那一刻起，我们就一直在向西扩张。随之而来的是问题。但我们甚至在早期国家的历史上就看到了这一点——1803年，在托马斯·杰斐逊领导下，我们进行了路易斯安那购地，这引发了密苏里加入联邦等问题。我们有密苏里妥协案。杰克逊在1830年代的印第安人迁移政策。这些都是美国向西扩张、占领新土地的例子。但在1840年代发生的事情是，奴隶制问题将越来越频繁地使西进运动复杂化。所以在1820年，那项妥协解决了这个问题，但它将再次出现。

让我们来谈谈波尔克领导下的扩张中一个至少在奴隶制问题上没有争议的时刻，那就是俄勒冈争端。在1844年的竞选期间，波尔克公开表示“五十四度四十分，否则就开战”——美国的边界将位于地图上的那个点。如果你还记得，根据1818年的英美公约，美国和英国同意与英国共同占领俄勒冈领地。

现在最终发生的是，越来越多的美国人沿着俄勒冈小道来到这个地区——他们进行了超过2000英里的旅程——这在1844年的选举中是一个主要问题。波尔克明确表示——我们将获得这片领土。好吧，并没有发生战斗。没有“五十四度四十分”，因为根据1846年的俄勒冈条约，英国同意放弃对该领土的主张，美国和加拿大之间的边界将是你在地图上看到的北纬49度线。现在英国确实同意这样做，部分原因是他们被保证在温哥华岛的捕鱼权。所以这场争端得到了和平解决。

然而，我们与墨西哥的矛盾就不会这样了。最终发生的是，如果你还记得，墨西哥仍然认为德克萨斯是墨西哥的一部分。事实上，他们不承认这个孤星共和国。桑塔安纳在这个问题上非常明确。他们对边界也有争议——你知道，是格兰德河还是努埃塞斯河？

好吧，波尔克试图从墨西哥购买加利福尼亚。由于整个德克萨斯问题，两国关系紧张。他派他的手下约翰·斯莱德尔去墨西哥试图以2500万美元的价格购买加利福尼亚。基本上，墨西哥甚至拒绝考虑这个提议。波尔克派扎卡里·泰勒进入墨西哥和德克萨斯之间的争议地区，美国军队在1846年4月遭到袭击，最终导致了美墨战争，这场战争持续了不到两年。

现在重要的是要记住，这场最终结束的战争非常有争议，尤其是在北方人中间。北方辉格党人甚至一些北方民主党人都反对这场战争。他们认为这是南方人试图将奴隶制扩展到新领土的企图。他们质疑——特别是来自北方的年轻国会议员亚伯拉罕·林肯——他提出了“定点决议”。他基本上说：“喂，波尔克，给我们看看这是否真的是对美国领土的袭击，”他质疑总统关于我们实际上在美国领土上遭到袭击的说法。

当来自宾夕法尼亚州的戴维·威尔莫特，我相信是这样，试图提出一项名为“威尔莫特但书”的提案时，争议进一步加剧。该提案基本上会说：“嘿，我们将禁止在因这场战争从墨西哥获得的任何领土上实行奴隶制。”这是1846年的事——他们甚至还没有赢得战争，但他们相当自信。该提案在众议院获得通过，因为北方人在人数上占优势，但它被参议院否决了。重要的是，南方人对北方这些抗议越来越怀疑——北方人正试图攻击或阻止我们的南方生活方式。

战争确实发生了，这对墨西哥来说是可怕的。他们输掉了大部分主要战役。战争于1848年以《瓜达卢佩-伊达尔戈条约》结束。该条约做了很多事情：基本上美国领土增加了三分之一。美国获得了加利福尼亚、新墨西哥和西南部其余地区，包括亚利桑那州、犹他州、内华达州等地。美国还让墨西哥同意放弃对德克萨斯的主张。他们同意接受格兰德河作为两国之间的边界。

这对墨西哥来说是毁灭性的——大约一半的墨西哥领土被夺走。这将给两国关系造成巨大的压力。更重要的是，对于APUSH来说，这将产生新的问题，因为随着这些新领土加入联邦，它将迫使奴隶制问题重新回到国家政治的中心。

这是《美国 pageant》第17章以及其他一些章节中关于泰勒和波尔克的总结。希望你们学到了一些东西，并且将在APUSH考试中获得五分。如果你还没有订阅乔氏制作，请务必订阅——今天促销，你可以免费订阅。如果这段视频对你有所帮助，请点赞并发表评论——说声“谢谢兄弟”，“谢谢老兄”，非常感谢。祝大家度过美好的一天，再见。

All right, all right, all right. Today we are going to be taking a look at the administrations of John Tyler and James K. Polk, roughly the period 1840 to 1848. If you're reading any of those American history books, this lecture is going to help you out.

So we start with the election of 1840. Remember there's that whole "Tippecanoe and Tyler too." The Whigs pick William Henry Harrison as their candidate - the war hero from Tippecanoe - and his vice president is actually a former Democrat by the name of John Tyler.

But Polk has some goals of his own: one, he wants to lower the tariff - he's a Democrat, the Whigs kind of favor the higher tariffs. He's also from the South - he wants to lower that bad boy. Two, a big thing - Manifest Destiny, national expansion. And he has some places in mind - Oregon. During the campaign he talks about "54-40 or fight" - he's going to take that from England. He's going to annex Texas (Tyler kind of preempts that and does it first), and he also wants to acquire California.

And it's worth taking a look at this idea of manifest destiny. It's a basic belief that it was America's destiny to conquer and civilize the entire continent from the east coast to the West Coast. And in this there is a certain level of, uh, built-in, uh, white superiority belief in this idea - idea that the continent, the people that are on it are not civilized and that we are the ones to conquer it and to bring civilization to the entire continent.
