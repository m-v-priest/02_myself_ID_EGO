What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're taking a look at the Marshall Court and the impact 影响；作用；冲击 of the Supreme Court case Marbury versus Madison.

You might recall 回忆起；记起 during the administrations 管理；行政部门 of Washington and Adams, political 政治的 parties 政党 formed 形成；组成. A lot of the division 分裂；分开；分歧 and debate 辩论；争论 took place 发生；举行 from within Washington's cabinet 内阁. Hamilton was on team Federalist, and Jefferson was on team Democratic-Republican. Eventually 最终；终于, the first party system would develop 发展；形成 in the 1790s, and as you could see right here, these two parties had very different views 观点；看法 about the power of the federal 联邦的 government 政府 and how the Constitution 宪法 should be interpreted 解释；说明.

For example, in response to 回应；答复 the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions 决议 were written. Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans argued 争论；辩论；主张 a state could nullify 使无效；宣布…无效 a federal 联邦的 law passed by Congress felt to be unconstitutional 违反宪法的；不符合宪法的. While in 1800, Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican, was elected president 总统 of the United States, marking 标志着；表明 the first peaceful transition 过渡；转变 of power 权力 in the young republic 共和国.

Now you may think with the Democratic-Republican Party in charge 负责；主管 that the power of the state governments will grow at the expense of 以…为代价；牺牲 the federal government. But you... you could not be more wrong. While the Federalists did lose both the presidency 总统职位 and control 控制；支配 of Congress 国会 in 1800, they still had control over the federal court system. And while the Democratic-Republicans were advocates 拥护者；提倡者 of state rights, the power of the federal government will dramatically 显著地；急剧地 increase 增加；增长 as a result of 由于；结果 decisions 决定；裁决 of the Supreme Court under John Marshall.

John Marshall was appointed 任命；委派 Chief Justice 首席大法官 of the Supreme Court in the last months of the Adams administration. Marshall would serve on 任职于；为…服务 the Supreme Court for 34 years, making him one of the longest serving judges 法官 in the history 历史 of the court 法院. As you can see from this graphic 图表的；形象的, his 34 years of time on the Supreme Court far surpasses 超过；胜过 the average 平均的 amount of time spent by most justices 法官 on the court -- even by today's standards 标准. And not to mention 更不用说；此外, back in the day, people did not live as long as Supreme Court justices typically 通常；一般 do today. 34 years leading 领导；主管 the court is a lot of time to shape 塑造；影响 judicial 司法的；审判的 opinion 看法；意见 in the young republic.

So let's talk about the importance 重要性 of the Supreme Court and in particular 特别是；尤其 the court under John Marshall. One of the most important cases of the early republic was the case of Marbury versus Madison in 1803. Now it's not really necessary to get into all the details 细节 of the case, but you best know why it's important. The Supreme Court ruling 裁决；判决 in Marbury versus Madison stated 声明；陈述 that the Supreme Court has the power to determine 确定；决定 the constitutionality 符合宪法；合宪性 of legislative 立法的 and executive 行政的 actions 行动；措施.

Marbury versus Madison was in direct opposition of 与…直接对立；与…截然相反 the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions because the case stated it was not the states who could determine 确定；决定 the constitutionality of a federal law or action. Rather 而是；宁可, the Supreme Court had the power to determine the meaning 意义；含义 of the Constitution. This is known as judicial 司法的；审判的 review 复审；审查. Judicial review meant the Supreme Court had the power to overrule 否决；推翻 actions of two branches 分支；部门 of the federal government that are determined to be unconstitutional. For instance 例如；比如, if Congress passed 通过；批准 a law, the Supreme Court could declare 宣布；声明 it was unconstitutional if the case made itself to the court. Or if the president 总统 did some executive action like issue 发布；颁布 an executive order 行政命令, the Supreme Court could also declare that act unconstitutional.

The principle 原则；原理 of judicial review affirmed 确认；证实 in Marbury versus Madison dramatically increased the power of the judicial branch. Another case decided in the Marshall Court was the case of McCulloch versus Maryland. The case came before 在…面前；提交给 the Supreme Court when the state of Maryland attempted 企图；试图 to tax 征税 a branch 分支机构 of the Bank of the United States. Remember, Hamilton and Jefferson disagreed 不同意；持有异议 whether or not the Constitution gave the federal government the power to create a national bank.

In the decision 决定；判决, Marshall argued 论证；主张 that even though 虽然；尽管 the Constitution does not mention 提到；提及 a national bank, the Constitution did provide 提供；供给 the federal government the power to establish 建立；设立 a bank. In the decision of McCulloch vs Maryland, the court ruled 裁定；判决 the bank was in fact 事实上；实际上 constitutional. Marshall used a loose interpretation 解释；理解 of the Constitution in the decision, and the Supreme Court decided that the federal government had the implied power to create a national bank. Hamilton would love this.

In the decision, Marshall stated that the power to tax involves 包含；涉及 the power to destroy 摧毁；破坏. You can hit pause and read the rest, but basically 基本上；主要地 in the decision, the Supreme Court will also reaffirm 再一次肯定；重申 and assert 断言；宣称 that federal laws took precedence over 优先于；优于 state laws. In short 简而言之；总之, in the case of McCulloch versus Maryland, the court used the doctrine 原则；信条 of implied power to increase 增加；提高 the authority 权力；权威 and power of the federal government. They limited 限制 state rights in favor of 有利于；支持 the federal government.

Another case that shows the increase in federal power was Gibbons vs Ogden in 1824. While the background 背景；经历 of the case was to determine 确定；决定 whether the state of New York could grant 授予；给予 a monopoly 垄断；独占 to a steamboat company if that action conflicted with 与…冲突；抵触 a charter 特许状；执照 authorized 授权；批准 by Congress, but you don't really need to know most of that unless you're going to some fancy 高级的；精美的 law school. What you need to know about the case of Gibbons vs Ogden is the court ruled the New York monopoly was unconstitutional. In doing so 这样做；在此过程中, the Marshall Court established 确立；建立 the federal government had control over interstate commerce 州际贸易 or trade that crossed state lines or trade between different states. In summary 总之；概括地说, Gibbons versus Ogden stated Congress has the authority 权力；权限 over interstate trade -- the federal government, not the states.

The decisions of the Marshall Court established the judicial branch as the institution 机构；制度 which determines the meaning of the Constitution and asserted federal laws took precedence over state laws. Now you might be thinking, who cares? I don't care. Why does any of this matter? Well, in the 1830s, Andrew Jackson is going to take steps 采取措施 to get rid of 摆脱；除去 the Bank of the U.S. that the Supreme Court said was constitutional. Also, Andrew Jackson is going to openly 公开地；坦率地 ignore 忽视；不理会 a decision of the Supreme Court which sought to 试图；设法 protect 保护 rights of Native Americans to their land. And in the 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt will try to pack 塞满；挤满 the court with justices that were more likely to 可能的；有希望的 decide potential 潜在的；可能的 cases in favor of 有利于；支持 the New Deal. And finally 最后；终于, in 1954, the Supreme Court case of Brown v Board of Education ruled that segregated 隔离的 schools were unconstitutional, but many states openly defied 公然反抗；违抗 the Supreme Court decision and refused 拒绝 to integrate 使结合；使一体化 their schools. All of these foreshadowing 预示；预兆 conflicts 冲突；争端 between states and the federal government and the interactions 互动；相互作用 between the judicial branch and other branches of government as well as state governments.

Ultimately 最终；最后 though, due to 由于；因为 the decisions made under Chief Justice John Marshall, whoever sits on 担任…职务；是…的成员 the court has tremendous 巨大的；极大的 power to shape decisions and laws in the nation, which makes who is elected president important beyond 不仅；超出 just the years they serve in the White House. As of 截至；到…为止 September 2021, each one of the justices you see on the screen are currently 目前；现在 serving on the Supreme Court. In the case of Clarence Thomas, he is still serving over 超过；在…之上 28 years after George H.W. Bush left office, proving 证明；证实 the impact of presidential 总统的 elections 选举 and the court nominations 提名；任命.

Now in our next video, I will examine 检查；审查 the American System and the legendary 传奇的；著名的 Henry Clay. Until next time, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们来探讨马歇尔法院以及最高法院马伯里诉麦迪逊案的影响。

你可能还记得，在华盛顿和亚当斯执政期间，政党形成了。许多分裂和辩论都发生在华盛顿的内阁内部。汉密尔顿属于联邦党阵营，而杰斐逊则属于民主共和党阵营。最终，第一个政党体系在 1790 年代形成，正如你在这里看到的，这两个政党对联邦政府的权力和宪法的解释方式有着截然不同的看法。

例如，为了回应《外国人与煽动叛乱法》，肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议得以撰写。杰斐逊和民主共和党人认为，如果一个州认为国会通过的联邦法律违宪，该州可以宣布该法律无效。1800 年，民主共和党人托马斯·杰斐逊当选美国总统，标志着这个年轻共和国首次和平的权力交接。

你现在可能认为，随着民主共和党执政，州政府的权力将以牺牲联邦政府的权力为代价而增长。但是……你大错特错了。虽然联邦党人在 1800 年失去了总统职位和对国会的控制权，但他们仍然控制着联邦法院系统。虽然民主共和党人是州权的倡导者，但由于约翰·马歇尔领导下的最高法院的裁决，联邦政府的权力将大大增加。

约翰·马歇尔是在亚当斯政府执政的最后几个月被任命为最高法院首席大法官的。马歇尔在最高法院任职 34 年，这使他成为法院历史上任职时间最长的法官之一。正如你从这张图表中看到的，他在最高法院的 34 年任职时间远远超过了大多数法官在法院任职的平均时间——即使以今天的标准来看也是如此。更不用说，在过去，人们的寿命不像今天的最高法院法官通常那样长。领导法院 34 年对于塑造这个年轻共和国的司法观点来说是相当长的时间。

现在让我们来谈谈最高法院的重要性，特别是约翰·马歇尔领导下的法院。早期共和国最重要的案件之一是 1803 年的马伯里诉麦迪逊案。现在没有必要深入了解该案的所有细节，但你最好知道它为什么重要。最高法院在马伯里诉麦迪逊案中的裁决声明，最高法院有权裁定立法和行政行为是否符合宪法。

马伯里诉麦迪逊案直接反对肯塔基和弗吉尼亚决议，因为该案声明，不是各州可以决定联邦法律或行为是否符合宪法。相反，最高法院有权决定宪法的含义。这被称为司法审查权。司法审查权意味着最高法院有权推翻联邦政府两个部门被裁定为违宪的行为。例如，如果国会通过了一项法律，如果该案诉诸法院，最高法院可以宣布该法律违宪。或者，如果总统采取了某些行政行为，如下达行政命令，最高法院也可以宣布该行为违宪。

马伯里诉麦迪逊案中确立的司法审查原则极大地增加了司法部门的权力。马歇尔法院裁决的另一个案件是麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案。该案提交最高法院是因为马里兰州试图对美国银行的一个分行征税。记住，汉密尔顿和杰斐逊在宪法是否赋予联邦政府创建国家银行的权力问题上存在分歧。

在判决中，马歇尔认为，即使宪法没有提到国家银行，宪法也确实赋予了联邦政府建立银行的权力。在麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案的判决中，法院裁定该银行实际上是合宪的。马歇尔在判决中对宪法采取了宽松的解释，最高法院裁定联邦政府拥有创建国家银行的隐含权力。汉密尔顿会喜欢这个的。

在判决中，马歇尔指出，征税权包含着毁灭权。你可以暂停视频阅读其余部分，但基本上在判决中，最高法院还将重申并强调联邦法律优先于州法律。简而言之，在麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案中，法院利用隐含权力原则来增加联邦政府的权威和权力。他们限制了州权，而倾向于联邦政府。

另一个表明联邦权力增加的案例是 1824 年的吉本斯诉奥格登案。虽然该案的背景是确定纽约州是否可以在其行动与国会授权的特许状冲突的情况下，授予一家汽船公司垄断权，但除非你打算去一所高级法学院，否则你不需要了解大部分内容。你需要了解的是，在吉本斯诉奥格登案中，法院裁定纽约州的垄断违宪。通过这样做，马歇尔法院确立了联邦政府对州际商业或跨越州界或不同州之间贸易的控制权。总而言之，吉本斯诉奥格登案声明国会对州际贸易拥有权威——联邦政府，而不是各州。

马歇尔法院的判决确立了司法部门作为决定宪法含义的机构，并强调联邦法律优先于州法律。你现在可能在想，谁在乎？我不在乎。这一切有什么意义？好吧，在 1830 年代，安德鲁·杰克逊将采取措施废除最高法院裁定为合宪的美国银行。此外，安德鲁·杰克逊将公开无视最高法院旨在保护美洲原住民土地权利的裁决。在 1930 年代，富兰克林·罗斯福将试图通过增加更有可能做出有利于新政裁决的法官来控制法院。最后，在 1954 年，布朗诉教育委员会案的最高法院裁决认为种族隔离学校违宪，但许多州公开蔑视最高法院的裁决，并拒绝整合他们的学校。所有这些都预示着州与联邦政府之间以及司法部门与其他政府部门以及州政府之间未来的冲突和互动。

然而，最终，由于首席大法官约翰·马歇尔领导下做出的裁决，无论谁在法院任职，都拥有巨大的权力来塑造国家的裁决和法律，这使得总统选举的重要性不仅仅在于他们在白宫任职的几年。截至 2021 年 9 月，你在屏幕上看到的每位大法官都在最高法院任职。以克拉伦斯·托马斯为例，在乔治·H.W. 布什卸任 28 年后，他仍在任职，这证明了总统选举和法院提名所产生的影响。

在我们的下一个视频中，我将探讨美国体系和传奇人物亨利·克莱。下次再见，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！

What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're taking a look at the Marshall Court and the impact of the Supreme Court case Marbury versus Madison.

You might recall during the administrations of Washington and Adams, political parties formed. A lot of the division and debate took place from within Washington's cabinet. Hamilton was on team Federalist, and Jefferson was on team Democratic-Republican. Eventually, the first party system would develop in the 1790s, and as you could see right here, these two parties had very different views about the power of the federal government and how the Constitution should be interpreted.

For example, in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were written. Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans argued a state could nullify a federal law passed by Congress felt to be unconstitutional. While in 1800, Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican, was elected president of the United States, marking the first peaceful transition of power in the young republic.

Now you may think with the Democratic-Republican Party in charge that the power of the state governments will grow at the expense of the federal government. But you... you could not be more wrong. While the Federalists did lose both the presidency and control of Congress in 1800, they still had control over the federal court system. And while the Democratic-Republicans were advocates of state rights, the power of the federal government will dramatically increase as a result of decisions of the Supreme Court under John Marshall.

John Marshall was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in the last months of the Adams administration. Marshall would serve on the Supreme Court for 34 years, making him one of the longest serving judges in the history of the court. As you can see from this graphic, his 34 years of time on the Supreme Court far surpasses the average amount of time spent by most justices on the court -- even by today's standards. And not to mention, back in the day, people did not live as long as Supreme Court justices typically do today. 34 years leading the court is a lot of time to shape judicial opinion in the young republic.

So let's talk about the importance of the Supreme Court and in particular the court under John Marshall. One of the most important cases of the early republic was the case of Marbury versus Madison in 1803. Now it's not really necessary to get into all the details of the case, but you best know why it's important. The Supreme Court ruling in Marbury versus Madison stated that the Supreme Court has the power to determine the constitutionality of legislative and executive actions.

Marbury versus Madison was in direct opposition of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions because the case stated it was not the states who could determine the constitutionality of a federal law or action. Rather, the Supreme Court had the power to determine the meaning of the Constitution. This is known as judicial review. Judicial review meant the Supreme Court had the power to overrule actions of two branches of the federal government that are determined to be unconstitutional. For instance, if Congress passed a law, the Supreme Court could declare it was unconstitutional if the case made itself to the court. Or if the president did some executive action like issue an executive order, the Supreme Court could also declare that act unconstitutional.

The principle of judicial review affirmed in Marbury versus Madison dramatically increased the power of the judicial branch. Another case decided in the Marshall Court was the case of McCulloch versus Maryland. The case came before the Supreme Court when the state of Maryland attempted to tax a branch of the Bank of the United States. Remember, Hamilton and Jefferson disagreed whether or not the Constitution gave the federal government the power to create a national bank.

In the decision, Marshall argued that even though the Constitution does not mention a national bank, the Constitution did provide the federal government the power to establish a bank. In the decision of McCulloch vs Maryland, the court ruled the bank was in fact constitutional. Marshall used a loose interpretation of the Constitution in the decision, and the Supreme Court decided that the federal government had the implied power to create a national bank. Hamilton would love this.

In the decision, Marshall stated that the power to tax involves the power to destroy. You can hit pause and read the rest, but basically in the decision, the Supreme Court will also reaffirm and assert that federal laws took precedence over state laws. In short, in the case of McCulloch versus Maryland, the court used the doctrine of implied power to increase the authority and power of the federal government. They limited state rights in favor of the federal government.

Another case that shows the increase in federal power was Gibbons vs Ogden in 1824. While the background of the case was to determine whether the state of New York could grant a monopoly to a steamboat company if that action conflicted with a charter authorized by Congress, but you don't really need to know most of that unless you're going to some fancy law school. What you need to know about the case of Gibbons vs Ogden is the court ruled the New York monopoly was unconstitutional. In doing so, the Marshall Court established the federal government had control over interstate commerce or trade that crossed state lines or trade between different states. In summary, Gibbons versus Ogden stated Congress has the authority over interstate trade -- the federal government, not the states.

The decisions of the Marshall Court established the judicial branch as the institution which determines the meaning of the Constitution and asserted federal laws took precedence over state laws. Now you might be thinking, who cares? I don't care. Why does any of this matter? Well, in the 1830s, Andrew Jackson is going to take steps to get rid of the Bank of the U.S. that the Supreme Court said was constitutional. Also, Andrew Jackson is going to openly ignore a decision of the Supreme Court which sought to protect rights of Native Americans to their land. And in the 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt will try to pack the court with justices that were more likely to decide potential cases in favor of the New Deal. And finally, in 1954, the Supreme Court case of Brown v Board of Education ruled that segregated schools were unconstitutional, but many states openly defied the Supreme Court decision and refused to integrate their schools. All of these foreshadowing conflicts between states and the federal government and the interactions between the judicial branch and other branches of government as well as state governments.

Ultimately though, due to the decisions made under Chief Justice John Marshall, whoever sits on the court has tremendous power to shape decisions and laws in the nation, which makes who is elected president important beyond just the years they serve in the White House. As of September 2021, each one of the justices you see on the screen are currently serving on the Supreme Court. In the case of Clarence Thomas, he is still serving over 28 years after George H.W. Bush left office, proving the impact of presidential elections and the court nominations.

Now in our next video, I will examine the American System and the legendary Henry Clay. Until next time, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!
