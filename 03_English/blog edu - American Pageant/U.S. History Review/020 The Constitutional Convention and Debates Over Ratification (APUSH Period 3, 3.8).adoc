What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. In this video, I will quickly review the topic of the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议 and debates over ratification 批准.

As we saw in our last video, there were a lot of difficulties under the Articles of Confederation. These challenges led to calls for a stronger central government, and delegates 代表 from the states met at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia to try to figure this thing out. In total, 55 delegates attended the Constitutional Convention from May to September of 1787. And check the image -- you could see we got some big names in this room.

The delegates decided pretty early on to replace the Articles rather than to attempt to revise 修订 it. And in the effort to develop a new constitution, delegates negotiated and ultimately compromised 妥协 with one another. One of the big issues that came up at the Constitutional Convention was how political representation 代表权 for the states in the federal government would be determined. Factions 派系 emerged early on. Large states are one group, and they have a very different set of ideas than the small states.

Remember, the Articles of Confederation created a one-branch government. There was no executive branch under the Articles. They were worried about creating a position that would exercise power 行使权力 like a king would. Instead, they just had a legislative branch. Congress consisted of a unicameral 一院制的 legislature with each state having only one representative. At the convention, small states wanted to maintain the equal representation of the Articles of Confederation.

At the convention, the New Jersey Plan 新泽西方案 proposed a unicameral legislature with each state having the same number of representatives. While a plan that calls for equal representatives for all states sounds like it would be fair, large states like Virginia -- which had a lot more people -- felt this proposal was completely unfair. Remember, these representatives of the legislative branch will eventually make the laws. Large states like Virginia with a population of over 700,000 people felt it was absurd 荒谬的 that they would get the same number of votes as a state such as Delaware that had less than a hundred thousand people.

Large states supported the Virginia Plan 弗吉尼亚方案 that called for a bicameral 两院制的 legislature with representation being determined by population. The more people in the state, the more representatives that state would get. Both the Virginia and New Jersey plans were proposals for how states would be represented in the legislative branch. As a result of negotiation and compromise amongst the delegates, the Great Compromise 大妥协 was adopted.

This deal established a bicameral legislature. Representation in the lower house -- the House of Representatives 众议院 -- would be based upon population. The more people you have, the more representatives you would get for your state in the House. Every 10 years, the population would be counted in the census 人口普查 and adjustments to representation would be made accordingly. In the upper house -- the Senate 参议院 -- each state would have equal representation. This equal representation was similar to what was under the Articles, but instead of one representative per state, each state would get two. Now, in order for a law to be passed by Congress, it has to pass both houses of Congress.

The next big issue at the convention was over the issue of slavery. Now, nowhere in the Constitution does the word "slave" or "slavery" appear, yet various protections were put in place to protect slavery. Southern delegates wanted their enslaved population to be counted in the count that determined representation in Congress. Since states like Virginia and South Carolina had a large number of enslaved people, they would get more representatives if those numbers were included in the count.

States without a large population of enslaved people felt enslaved people should not be counted when determining representation in Congress. Slaveholders considered those they enslaved property, so it made no sense to include them in the count. Whether or not enslaved people would be counted for the purpose of determining representation in Congress split northern and southern delegates. Southern delegates threatened to walk out of the Constitutional Convention over this issue, but ultimately negotiation and compromise would be achieved in the form of the Three-Fifths Compromise 五分之三妥协.

The Three-Fifths Compromise dealt with the issue of how enslaved people would be counted towards congressional representation. The Three-Fifths Compromise stated that enslaved people would be counted three-fifths of a person for representation purposes in the House of Representatives. As a result of this compromise, southern power in the House of Representatives was increased, but not as much as they would have liked.

While some delegates wanted the international slave trade to end immediately at the Constitutional Convention, the delegates decided to not prohibit the international slave trade until after 1808. In other words, the transatlantic slave trade was extended for 20 years in the Constitution. Keep in mind, they did not place any restrictions on the very lucrative 赚钱的 internal slave trade within the United States. And in the Constitution, there was also a Fugitive Slave Clause 逃奴条款. Although, like the rest of the Constitution, the word "slave" or "slavery" do not appear, the clause was intended to return enslaved people who escaped from a slave state to a free state to their lawful owner.

And it is important to note, the Three-Fifths Compromise and other provisions on slavery in the Constitution were designed to protect the economic interest of slaveholders. And as a result, various compromises would be made. And even at the Constitutional Convention, differences over slavery emerged between the north and the south. Those differences will only intensify 加剧 as debates about the expansion of slavery eventually came to dominate the political debate in the new nation -- foreshadowing 预示.

Once the delegates were done drafting the proposed Constitution, a debate over ratification took place. The new Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, and in order for the new government to go into effect, nine out of the 13 states had to ratify. Right away, factions developed over the issue of ratification. Anti-Federalists 反联邦党人 opposed ratification of the Constitution. The concern of Anti-Federalists was that the new Constitution put too much power into the hands of a centralized national government. Anti-Federalists wanted a Bill of Rights 权利法案 added and additional support for state rights.

The Federalists 联邦党人，on the other hand, supported ratification of the Constitution. They felt this new national government was a vast improvement over the Articles of Confederation. To try to increase support for ratification, the Federalist Papers 联邦党人文集 were written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. The goal of the Federalist Papers was to convince those reluctant 犹豫的 to support ratification of the Constitution to change their minds. The essays explain the advantages of a stronger federal government.

To increase support for ratification of the Constitution, Federalists promised to add a Bill of Rights that enumerated 列举 individual rights and explicitly 明确地 restricted the powers of the federal government. You could see the order of ratification on the map. Fun fact: if you are ever in Delaware, you will know that Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution -- something they are very proud of. States such as Massachusetts agreed to ratify the Constitution only after they were promised that a Bill of Rights would be added.

Not too long after ratification and this addition of the Bill of Rights will get enough states on board, and the Constitution will go into effect. However, we will have to wait until our next video to learn about what is exactly in this new document. Until next time, thank you so much for watching Joe's Productions. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。在这个视频中，我将快速回顾一下制宪会议和关于批准的辩论。

正如我们在上一个视频中看到的，邦联条例下存在许多困难。这些挑战导致人们呼吁建立一个更强大的中央政府，各州的代表在费城的制宪会议上会面，试图解决这个问题。总共有 55 名代表参加了 1787 年 5 月至 9 月举行的制宪会议。看看这张图片——你可以看到这个房间里有一些大人物。

代表们很早就决定废除邦联条例，而不是试图修改它。在制定新宪法的过程中，代表们相互谈判并最终达成了妥协。制宪会议上出现的一个重大问题是如何确定各州在联邦政府中的政治代表权。早期就出现了派别。大州是一个群体，他们与小州有着截然不同的想法。

记住，邦联条例建立了一个一院制政府。邦联条例下没有行政部门。他们担心建立一个像国王一样行使权力的职位。相反，他们只有一个立法部门。国会由一个一院制立法机构组成，每个州只有一名代表。在制宪会议上，小州希望维持邦联条例下的平等代表权。

在制宪会议上，新泽西方案提议设立一个一院制立法机构，每个州拥有相同数量的代表。虽然一个呼吁所有州拥有平等代表的方案听起来很公平，但像弗吉尼亚这样的大州——人口多得多——认为这个提议完全不公平。记住，这些立法部门的代表最终将制定法律。像弗吉尼亚这样拥有超过 70 万人口的大州认为，他们与特拉华州（人口不到 10 万）拥有相同数量的选票是荒谬的。

大州支持弗吉尼亚方案，该方案呼吁设立一个两院制立法机构，代表权由人口决定。州的人口越多，该州在立法机构中的代表就越多。弗吉尼亚方案和新泽西方案都是关于各州如何在立法部门中获得代表权的提案。由于代表们之间的谈判和妥协，最终通过了伟大的妥协。

这项协议建立了一个两院制立法机构。下议院——众议院——的代表权将基于人口。你的人口越多，你在众议院拥有的州代表就越多。每 10 年，人口将通过人口普查进行统计，并相应地调整代表权。在上议院——参议院——每个州将拥有平等的代表权。这种平等的代表权与邦联条例下的情况类似，但每个州不是一名代表，而是两名。现在，为了使一项法律在国会获得通过，它必须同时获得国会两院的通过。

制宪会议上的下一个重大问题是奴隶制问题。现在，宪法的任何地方都没有出现“奴隶”或“奴隶制”这两个词，但却制定了各种保护奴隶制的措施。南方代表希望他们被奴役的人口被纳入决定国会代表权的人口统计中。由于像弗吉尼亚州和南卡罗来纳州这样拥有大量被奴役人口的州，如果将这些数字纳入统计，它们将获得更多的代表。

没有大量被奴役人口的州认为，在决定国会代表权时不应将被奴役的人计算在内。奴隶主认为他们奴役的人是财产，因此将他们纳入统计毫无意义。是否将被奴役的人纳入决定国会代表权的人口统计中，分裂了北方和南方的代表。南方代表威胁要因此问题退出制宪会议，但最终通过谈判和妥协达成了五分之三妥协。

五分之三妥协处理了如何将被奴役的人计入国会代表权的问题。五分之三妥协规定，在众议院的代表权方面，将被奴役的人按五分之三的人口计算。由于这项妥协，南方在众议院的权力有所增加，但并没有达到他们希望的程度。

虽然一些代表希望在制宪会议上立即结束国际奴隶贸易，但代表们决定在 1808 年之后才禁止国际奴隶贸易。换句话说，跨大西洋奴隶贸易在宪法中延长了 20 年。记住，他们没有对美国境内利润丰厚的国内奴隶贸易施加任何限制。在宪法中，还有一项逃奴条款。虽然像宪法的其余部分一样，“奴隶”或“奴隶制”这两个词没有出现，但该条款旨在将被奴隶从奴隶州逃到自由州的人归还给他们的合法主人。

重要的是要注意，宪法中的五分之三妥协和其他关于奴隶制的条款旨在保护奴隶主的经济利益。因此，将达成各种妥协。即使在制宪会议上，南北方在奴隶制问题上也存在分歧。随着关于奴隶制扩张的辩论最终主导新国家的政治辩论，这些分歧只会加剧——伏笔。

一旦代表们完成起草拟议的宪法，关于批准的辩论就开始了。新宪法被送往各州批准，为了使新政府生效，13 个州中必须有 9 个州批准。关于批准问题，各派立刻形成。反联邦主义者反对批准宪法。反联邦主义者的担忧是，新宪法将过多的权力置于中央集权的国家政府手中。反联邦主义者希望增加权利法案并进一步支持州权。

另一方面，联邦主义者支持批准宪法。他们认为这个新的国家政府比邦联条例有了巨大的进步。为了争取更多对批准的支持，《联邦党人文集》由亚历山大·汉密尔顿、詹姆斯·麦迪逊和约翰·杰伊撰写。《联邦党人文集》的目标是说服那些不愿支持批准宪法的人改变他们的想法。这些文章解释了一个更强大的联邦政府的优势。

为了增加对批准宪法的支持，联邦主义者承诺增加一项权利法案，其中列举了个人权利并明确限制了联邦政府的权力。你可以看到地图上的批准顺序。有趣的是：如果你曾经去过特拉华州，你会知道特拉华州是第一个批准宪法的州——他们对此非常自豪。像马萨诸塞州这样的州只有在被承诺将增加权利法案后才同意批准宪法。

批准后不久，加上权利法案，将会有足够的州加入，宪法将生效。然而，我们将不得不等到下一个视频才能了解这份新文件的具体内容。下次再见，非常感谢您观看乔氏制作。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
