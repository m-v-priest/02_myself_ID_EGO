What's up, beautiful people? Today we are taking a look at labor 劳动；劳工, slavery 奴隶制；奴役 and caste 种姓（按照血统、阶级、财富等严格区分的社会等级） in the Spanish colonial system.

In the last video, we touched on 提及；谈到 the impact of the arrival of Christopher Columbus and early Spanish colonization 殖民；殖民地化. Now we are going to get into the society that will be created during the process of colonization — all that stuff in the blue.

As mentioned previously, part of the Columbian Exchange is the transfer 转移；迁移 of people. But the Spaniards who came to the Western Hemisphere were mainly dudes not looking to work. Early on, Spain's empire relied on Native Americans as the primary 主要的；首要的 labor force. The forced labor system of native people was known as the encomienda system （西班牙在美洲殖民地的）委托监护制, and the system developed as the way of enslaving 奴役；束缚 Native Americans to work in agriculture such as the sugar plantations 种植园 in the Caribbean or to extract 提取；提炼 precious metals such as in the gold and silver mines in the Spanish colonies.

In addition to being enslaved in the encomienda system, native people were also forced to convert to 使改变（宗教或信仰）；使皈依 Catholicism 天主教. In spite of 尽管 what my fourth grade California education taught me, the Spanish missions 传教活动 were not great places. I remember back in fourth grade being required to build a replica 复制品；仿制品 of a Spanish mission, never really learning anything about the experiences of the native people at these missions. There you can see pretty much what my fourth grade mission looked like. Just for giggles, in the comments let me know the most ridiculous school project you ever had to do.

In both the mission and encomienda system, countless native people died due to the grueling 繁重的；艰苦的 work, harsh 残酷的；严厉的 treatment and exposure to 遭受；面临 diseases. Other Native Americans ran away since they knew the land better than the Spanish colonizers 殖民者, and enslaved is no bueno (no good 不好). The lucky ones said "adios" and ran away.

Whereas the encomienda system exploited 剥削；压榨 the labor of Native Americans, over time throughout much of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, a labor system based upon enslaved African people developed. It is important to note that in the colonization of the Americas, the Spanish relied on the encomienda system and the Atlantic slave trade to organize, regulate 管理；控制 and control the labor of indigenous 土著的；本土的 and African people. As the demand increased for sugar and other crops grown in the Americas, Spain increasingly relied on African people as the new source of labor.

One other example of the impact of the Columbian Exchange and Spanish colonization on the Western Hemisphere cannot be found on this lovely graphic, but another impact was the development of new ethnicities 种族；民族 such as mestizo 梅斯蒂索人（欧洲人与美洲土著人的混血儿） and mulatto 穆拉托人（白人与黑人的混血儿）. Most of the explorers, conquistadors （16世纪的）西班牙征服者 and Spanish settlers were dudes, and as a result, sexual relationships and even in some cases intermarriage 异族通婚 was common among Spanish men and native women. This would lead to a new mixed race group called mestizos. Children between a person of European and African descent 血统；出身 were known as mulattos.

Throughout the Spanish empire, you had the emergence 出现；兴起 of a racially mixed population as intermarriage and/or sex occurred between European, Native American and African people. Now, don't let this diversity make you think things were wonderful for these various groups in the Spanish empire — that is not going to be the case, because the Spanish developed a caste system 种姓制度 that incorporated 包含；吸收 and carefully defined 界定；明确 the status 地位；身份 of the diverse population of Europeans, Africans and Native Americans in their empire.

And you could see the hierarchy 等级制度: the peninsulares 半岛人（出生于西班牙的西班牙人） were at the top (those were Spaniards born in Spain), and you could see the kind of hierarchy that remained with enslaved people being at the bottom of the social pyramid 金字塔. And the legacy 遗留问题；后遗症 of colonization and the caste system that developed is still something being felt and discussed throughout various Latin American communities.

In our next video, I will examine 考察；调查 cultural interactions between Europeans, Native Americans and Africans. And until then, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我们来探讨西班牙殖民体系中的劳动力、奴隶制和种姓制度。

在上一段视频中，我们谈到了克里斯托弗·哥伦布的到来和早期西班牙殖民的影响。现在我们将深入了解在殖民化过程中形成的社会——所有蓝色区域所代表的。

正如之前提到的，哥伦布大交换的一部分是人口的转移。但是来到西半球的西班牙人主要是男人，他们并不想工作。早期，西班牙的帝国依赖美洲原住民作为主要的劳动力。强迫当地居民劳动的制度被称为“恩科米enda”制度，该制度发展成为奴役美洲原住民在农业（如加勒比地区的糖料种植园）或开采贵金属（如西班牙殖民地的金银矿）中劳动的手段。

除了在恩科米enda制度下被奴役外，当地居民还被迫皈依天主教。与我在加州四年级所受的教育不同，西班牙的传教团并非美好的地方。我记得四年级时被要求制作西班牙传教团的模型，但从未真正了解当地居民在这些传教团中的经历。在那里你可以看到我四年级时制作的传教团的大致样子。开个玩笑，请在评论中告诉我你做过的最荒谬的学校项目是什么。

在传教团和恩科米enda制度下，无数当地居民因繁重的工作、残酷的待遇和暴露于疾病而死亡。其他美洲原住民逃跑了，因为他们比西班牙殖民者更了解这片土地，而且被奴役可不是什么好事。“再见”是那些幸运逃脱的人说的。

虽然恩科米enda制度剥削了美洲原住民的劳动力，但随着时间的推移，在西班牙和葡萄牙的大部分殖民地，一种基于被奴役的非洲人的劳动制度发展起来。重要的是要注意，在美洲的殖民化过程中，西班牙依靠恩科米enda制度和跨大西洋奴隶贸易来组织、管理和控制土著和非洲人的劳动。随着对美洲种植的糖和其他作物的需求增加，西班牙越来越依赖非洲人作为新的劳动力来源。

哥伦布大交换和西班牙殖民对西半球影响的另一个例子无法在这个漂亮的图表中找到，但另一个影响是新的种族的形成，如梅斯蒂索人和穆拉托人。大多数探险家、征服者和西班牙定居者都是男性，因此，西班牙男性和当地女性之间的性关系，甚至在某些情况下是通婚都很常见。这将导致一个新的混血群体，称为梅斯蒂索人。欧洲血统和非洲血统的人所生的孩子被称为穆拉托人。

在整个西班牙帝国，由于欧洲人、美洲原住民和非洲人之间的通婚和/或性行为，出现了一个多种族混合的人口。现在，不要因为这种多样性而认为西班牙帝国内这些不同群体的生活很美好——事实并非如此，因为西班牙人发展了一种种姓制度，该制度纳入并仔细界定了其帝国中欧洲人、非洲人和美洲原住民不同人口的地位。

你可以看到这种等级制度：半岛人（在西班牙出生的西班牙人）位居顶层，你可以看到这种等级制度一直存在，被奴役的人处于社会金字塔的底层。而殖民化和由此形成的种姓制度的遗产至今仍在拉丁美洲各个社群中被感受到和讨论。

在我们的下一个视频中，我将探讨欧洲人、美洲原住民和非洲人之间的文化互动。在那之前，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！

And you could see the hierarchy: the peninsulares were at the top (those were Spaniards born in Spain), and you could see the kind of hierarchy that remained with enslaved people being at the bottom of the social pyramid. And the legacy of colonization and the caste system that developed is still something being felt and discussed throughout various Latin American communities.

In our next video, I will examine cultural interactions between Europeans, Native Americans and Africans. And until then, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!
