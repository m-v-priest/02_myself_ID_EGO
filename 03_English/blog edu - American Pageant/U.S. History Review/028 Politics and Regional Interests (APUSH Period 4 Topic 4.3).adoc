What's up 怎么了, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we are covering politics and regional interest 地区利益 in the early 19th century.

Following the War of 1812 1812年战争, there was a growing sense of nationalism 民族主义 in the United States. The period after the election of 1816 was known as the Era of Good Feelings 和睦时期. Only one political party existed -- the Democratic-Republicans -- and the vibe 氛围 in the nation was so nice.

In spite of increased nationalism following the War of 1812, regional interest often trumped 胜过 national concerns as the basis for many political leaders' positions on slavery and economic policy. So what do I mean by regional interest? Increasingly, the North, West, and South were developing into distinct societies 独特社会 with their own particular set of interests. Another term for this is sectionalism 地方主义. Sectionalism is a devotion to the interests of a region over those of the country as a whole.

The North at this time was primarily involved in industry 工业 and manufacturing 制造业. The South was primarily involved in agriculture 农业 and the growing of the cash crop 经济作物 cotton. In spite of these differences in the economy of the North and South, Southern cotton was fueling 推动 the industrialization 工业化 of the North. Adding to all this is the invention of the cotton gin 轧棉机, patented 获得专利 by Eli Whitney in 1794, dramatically increased the process of processing the cotton. With the expansion in the demand for cotton came a dramatic growth in the institution of slavery 奴隶制度.

In the West, the concern was for access to cheap land and internal transportation improvements 国内交通改善. Now we've seen following the War of 1812, Henry Clay proposed the American System 美国体系 which consisted of the following: renewal of the national bank, protective tariff 保护性关税, and internal transportation improvements. In doing these things, Clay felt the entire country would benefit by unifying the U.S. economy. Check the link in the description for the video about the American System.

Clay felt internal transportation improvements would help develop the national economy and unify the nation, and that these internal improvements would not only benefit the U.S. economy but would also help increase the connections within the country and help lessen sectional divisions 地区分歧. As you can see, these regions each did things the other sections benefited from.

Clay believed a protective tariff would be key to developing American manufacturing and industry. By protecting American industry from British competition, Clay felt the U.S. should increase domestic manufacturing 国内制造业 to promote prosperity 促进繁荣. However, people in the South and West felt the Tariff of 1816 would favor industry over agriculture, thereby favoring Northern states that had a greater reliance on industry and manufacturing. As a result, the Tariff of 1816 was opposed by many Southern and Western politicians.

The situation was even worse when it came to competing regional interests over slavery. Remember, after the American Revolution, the former Northern and Middle colonies had gradually ended slavery. Even in the Northwest Ordinances 西北条例 under the Articles of Confederation, slavery was prohibited in states created out of the old Northwest Territory. During this time, the North and the South were becoming two very different societies.

Between 1791 and 1819, nine new states joined the original 13 states, and by 1819 there was a balance between slave and free states at 11 each. Sectionalism emerged when the first territory from the Louisiana Purchase attempted to enter the union as a slave state -- Missouri. Northerners opposed the admission of Missouri as a slave state. Now don't get it twisted -- most people in the North were not against slavery but against the admission of a slave state which would have representation in Congress.

Here is what I mean: The admission of Missouri as a slave state would threaten the balance of power 权力平衡 in Congress as follows. In 1819, there were 11 free and 11 slave states. If Missouri were added to the union as a slave state, that would now be 12 slave states versus 11 free states. I know -- sick math skills. Without the balance of free and slave states, one section would be able to get legislation passed that benefited their interest. In this case, the South would have the advantage. Those slave state votes in the Senate and the House of Representatives would allow Southern slave state interests to vote against Northern interest. If Missouri entered as a slave state, the South would have two more senators than the North and additional representatives in the House of Representatives.

The South also got heated over the situation in Missouri. Slave states were very angry over the Tallmadge Amendment 塔尔梅奇修正案 proposed by Representative James Tallmadge from New York. The amendment prohibited the further introduction of enslaved people into Missouri and stated those enslaved currently in Missouri would be freed at the age of 25. The goal of the Tallmadge Amendment was clearly the gradual elimination 逐步废除 of slavery in Missouri. Southerners saw the amendment as an attack on slavery. Could this be the beginning of an attack on the slave system throughout the South? They thought if Congress could abolish slavery in Missouri, it might attempt to do the same in some of the older Southern slave states.

Slave states had enough power in the Senate to block passage 阻止通过 of the Tallmadge Amendment, and the tension over Missouri was only solved with a compromise brokered 斡旋达成 with the help of Henry Clay. The Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协案 did the following: Missouri was admitted as a slave state; Maine was admitted as a free state (previously it was part of the state of Massachusetts); and slavery was prohibited in the rest of the Louisiana Territory north of the 36°30' line that they established. This part of the deal meant the Missouri Compromise closed most of the Louisiana Purchase to slavery.

And while this compromise helped lessen sectional tensions temporarily, as the nation expanded west, the question of slavery in the territories increasingly occupied the national attention and contributed to sectional tension. The political compromise achieved with the Missouri deal only temporarily stemmed 暂时遏制 growing tensions between the North and South. But the important idea is this: Although the Era of Good Feelings was a time of nationalism, sectional tension increased between the North and South as each section attempted to pursue their regional interests.

Some people during the Era of Good Feelings were not... "I don't feel so good." Based upon the different regional interests of the North and South, they pursued different policies. And as you can see, different regional interests affected debates in the early republic.

In our next video, I will examine Andrew Jackson and federal power. But that's going to do it for today. Thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们来探讨 19 世纪早期政治和地区利益。

1812 年战争结束后，美国国内的民族主义情绪日益高涨。1816 年大选后的这段时期被称为“美好时代”。当时只有一个政党——民主共和党——国家氛围一片祥和。

尽管 1812 年战争后民族主义情绪有所增强，但地区利益往往超越国家关切，成为许多政治领导人在奴隶制和经济政策上立场的基础。那么我所说的地区利益是什么意思呢？北方、西部和南部日益发展成为拥有各自独特利益的截然不同的社会。另一个术语是地区主义。地区主义是指对地区利益的忠诚高于对整个国家利益的忠诚。

当时的北方主要从事工业和制造业。南方主要从事农业和经济作物棉花的种植。尽管南北方经济存在这些差异，但南方棉花却推动了北方的工业化。此外，伊莱·惠特尼于 1794 年获得专利的轧棉机的发明极大地提高了棉花的加工效率。随着对棉花需求的扩大，奴隶制也急剧增长。

在西部，人们关心的是获得廉价土地和国内交通基础设施的改善。我们已经看到，1812 年战争结束后，亨利·克莱提出了美国体系，该体系包括：复兴国家银行、实行保护性关税和进行国内交通基础设施建设。克莱认为，通过这些措施，整个国家将通过统一美国经济而受益。请查看描述中关于美国体系的视频链接。

克莱认为，国内交通基础设施的改善将有助于发展国民经济，团结国家，并且这些国内改善不仅有利于美国经济，而且还有助于加强国内联系，减少地区分裂。正如你所看到的，这些地区各自所做的事情都使其他地区受益。

克莱认为，保护性关税是发展美国制造业和工业的关键。通过保护美国工业免受英国竞争，克莱认为美国应该增加国内制造业以促进繁荣。然而，南方和西部的人们认为 1816 年关税会偏袒工业而不是农业，从而偏袒那些更依赖工业和制造业的北方各州。结果，1816 年关税遭到了许多南方和西部政治家的反对。

当涉及到奴隶制问题上相互竞争的地区利益时，情况就更糟了。记住，美国革命后，以前的北方和中部殖民地逐渐结束了奴隶制。即使在邦联条例下的西北法令中，在旧西北地区建立的各州也禁止奴隶制。在此期间，北方和南方正成为两个截然不同的社会。

在 1791 年至 1819 年间，九个新州加入了最初的 13 个州，到 1819 年，蓄奴州和自由州的数量达到了 11 个的平衡。当路易斯安那购地中第一个试图以蓄奴州身份加入联邦的地区——密苏里——出现时，地区主义就显现出来了。北方人反对密苏里州作为蓄奴州加入联邦。现在不要误解——北方的大多数人不是反对奴隶制本身，而是反对一个蓄奴州加入联邦，因为这将使其在国会中拥有代表权。

我的意思是：密苏里州作为蓄奴州加入联邦将威胁到国会的权力平衡，具体如下。1819 年，有 11 个自由州和 11 个蓄奴州。如果密苏里州作为蓄奴州加入联邦，那么将变成 12 个蓄奴州对 11 个自由州。我知道——高超的数学技能。在没有自由州和蓄奴州平衡的情况下，一个地区将能够通过有利于自身利益的立法。在这种情况下，南方将占据优势。参议院和众议院中那些蓄奴州的选票将使南方蓄奴州的利益能够投票反对北方利益。如果密苏里州作为蓄奴州加入联邦，南方将比北方多出两名参议员和更多的众议院代表。

南方也对密苏里州的局势感到愤怒。蓄奴州对纽约州众议员詹姆斯·塔尔梅奇提出的塔尔梅奇修正案非常不满。该修正案禁止进一步将被奴役的人引入密苏里州，并规定目前在密苏里州被奴役的人在 25 岁时将被释放。塔尔梅奇修正案的目标显然是逐步在密苏里州废除奴隶制。南方人将该修正案视为对奴隶制的攻击。这是否是开始攻击整个南方奴隶制度的开端？他们认为，如果国会能够在密苏里州废除奴隶制，它可能会试图在一些较老的南方蓄奴州也这样做。

蓄奴州在参议院拥有足够的权力阻止塔尔梅奇修正案的通过，而密苏里州的紧张局势最终在亨利·克莱的帮助下通过一项妥协得以解决。《密苏里妥协案》规定如下：密苏里州作为蓄奴州加入联邦；缅因州作为自由州加入联邦（此前它是马萨诸塞州的一部分）；并且在他们划定的北纬 36°30'线以北的路易斯安那领地的其余地区禁止奴隶制。这项协议意味着《密苏里妥协案》关闭了路易斯安那购地的大部分地区，禁止奴隶制。

虽然这项妥协暂时缓解了地区紧张局势，但随着国家向西扩张，领土上的奴隶制问题日益引起全国关注，并加剧了地区紧张局势。《密苏里妥协案》达成的政治妥协只是暂时遏制了南北方日益增长的紧张关系。但重要的观点是：尽管“美好时代”是民族主义时期，但随着各地区试图追求其地区利益，南北方之间的地区紧张局势加剧。

在“美好时代”期间，有些人并不……“我感觉不太好。”基于南北方不同的地区利益，他们奉行不同的政策。正如你所看到的，不同的地区利益影响了早期共和国的辩论。

在我们的下一个视频中，我将探讨安德鲁·杰克逊和联邦权力。但今天就到这里。非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
