What's up, beautiful people? Today in this Joe's Productions video, we're taking a look at: you won't believe what a pilgrim did to a turkey — Plymouth explained.

There are a lot of famous Americans, of course. You learn about many in history textbooks, by looking at your money (by the way, your money is racist — check out my satirical 讽刺的 video in the link below). You might even learn about famous Americans by looking at some mountains. There are also some infamous 声名狼藉的 Americans. There is John C. Calhoun, who referred to slavery as a "positive good" — his portrait still hanging in the halls of Congress while morons stormed the capital. There is even this racist lady who, like a bunch of other people, tried to prevent the Little Rock 9 from going to school.

There are also people in history who you should know about but probably don't. One such person is Thomas Granger. He was guilty of something called buggery 鸡奸（指与动物发生性行为或男性间的肛交）. Buggery at the time was defined as an unnatural sexual act against the will of God and man. Now before I give you the deets about what he did (the buggery involved a...), Tom was one of the first individuals to be put to death in the Plymouth Colony, and he is the first known juvenile 少年 to be sentenced to death in what is today the United States. Sadly, even today, teenagers are still messing around.

Over in Plymouth, the story you probably heard in school about the New England region goes something like this: the pilgrims, a persecuted 受迫害的 group in England, set sail on the Mayflower seeking religious freedom. This of course already is not entirely accurate, because these separatists 分离主义者 (who didn't even call themselves pilgrims) already had religious freedom in Holland. The separatists had been living in exile 流放 in Holland for 10 years prior to their journey to North America. The real reason they made the trek 长途跋涉 was the fact that in Holland they were stuck making terrible wages in the textile 纺织业 industry. Yes, they had religious freedom in the Netherlands, but they were living in poverty 贫困. Being broke ain't no joke.

On the Mayflower, they set up one of the first agreements for self-government in the New World. And when they got to Plymouth, they didn't exactly have the easiest of times. They did get somewhat lucky in that the settlers took over a spot that was basically a former Native American settlement. The area had cleared out space for agricultural 农业的 fields, but the Native American community that once lived there was wiped out from diseases brought in by shipwrecked French explorers.

Like many of the colonies, the first group of pilgrims struggled. Only around 50 of the original 102 passengers survived the first winter. Luckily for the colonists, a local Native American named Squanto helped the pilgrims. Squanto served as a translator which helped with diplomacy 外交 between the Plymouth settlement and neighboring tribes, and also helped facilitate 促进 trade. Squanto showed the colonists spots to fish and how to plant corn.

Now what they probably didn't tell you in school was how he learned to speak English. Squanto was captured by English explorers in 1614, sold into slavery in Spain, eventually he ended up in England, learned English while in England for several years, and eventually got his freedom. When Squanto came back to the New England region in 1619, his entire tribe was dead from smallpox 天花.

Both the Plymouth Colony and all of us in the United States are lucky the Plymouth colonists became temporary BFFs with the local Native American tribe. The Plymouth colony is lucky because there would have been a heck of a lot more colonists dead if they didn't get the help. And we are lucky because we wouldn't have the first Thanksgiving if it wasn't for this historical reality.

By the time of the first Thanksgiving in 1621, about half of the original pilgrims had died. The first Thanksgiving was a three-day gathering which included members of the Wampanoag tribe and the colonists who weren't dead. They were not only thankful for the abundance 丰富 of food but also grateful to be alive.

Now a lot of what you know about the first Thanksgiving is probably wrong. There is no evidence they ate turkey, and they definitely didn't have any pie. Wild turkey were in the area, but there's no evidence they were served at this feast 盛宴. The Wampanoag did bring five deer for dinner. And contrary to 与…相反 popular depictions, there were about 90 native people in attendance — almost doubled the number of pilgrims by some accounts.

Not to mention, in the year 1636 (just 15 years after the first Thanksgiving), the colonists of the New England region would fight a brutal 残酷的 war against the local Pequot tribe. But to be fair, whose family Thanksgiving meal doesn't end in some type of dramatic fight or violence — especially when your racist uncle starts talking politics?

Nevertheless, the temporary partnership and celebration between the pilgrims and local Native Americans is why we now eat on average like 50,000 calories in one day on Thanksgiving.

Now the New England region continued to expand when in the late 1620s the Puritans led by Jonathan Winthrop established the Massachusetts Bay Colony. By the 1640s, the entire New England region was doing much better in the "people not dying" department. Generally speaking, the New England colonies developed around small towns with family farms. Strict Puritan social customs and laws kept the colony focused on its religious mission.

But this close-knit community was changing. Some colonists (very few) were strained from the original mission of the colony. Drunkenness, premarital 婚前的 sex, and people like Thomas Granger were causing concern. Unfortunately, we do not know what our boy Tommy looked like. Throughout this presentation, I will be using a variety of possible approximations 近似值 of young Tommy Granger.

Granger was a teen servant, either 16 or 17 years old in Plymouth. Being a servant meant he was near the bottom of New England colonial society — not exactly attracting the ladies in town. While we do not know what he looked like, we do know this: one day while Thomas was partaking in the words of William Bradford, "lewd 猥亵的 practiced towards the mayor," somebody caught him.

Governor William Bradford (the guy who wrote the most definitive 权威性的 primary source about the Plymouth Colony in its history) wrote about the incident in *Of Plymouth Plantation*. His book is the main source for much of what is known about the pilgrims. At first, Thomas Granger pulled the "shaggy defense" and denied the charges ("it wasn't me"), but upon questioning and the fact he was caught in the act, Tommyboy admitted to not only making whoopi to the horse on the regular, but also got down with a bunch of other farm animals.

Court records indicate he also admitted that in addition to the mayor, lover boy Thomas also was involved with a cow, two goats, five different sheep, two calves 小牛, and a freaking turkey. Now I am not sure what inspired young hormone-filled Thomas. Maybe he saw an ankle that drove him crazy with desire. But in the end, Thomas Granger was put to death for having sexy time with not only a turkey but also a number of different animals. The official court ruling was "death by hanging until he was dead."

You might recall that there was no supermarkets back in the day, so logic would indicate that the animals (I mean victims) were then eaten — but not the case. Remember, the New England colonies were super religious. Much of their laws were from the Bible, intent on enforcing Leviticus 20:15 which said: "And if a man lie with a beast, he shall be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast." The animals involved were slaughtered right in front of Thomas and were buried since they had been defiled 玷污.

Now I bet you are waiting for the moment that this video was going to have some bigger meaning — that this history inspired animal rights, that this would turn into an epic love story, or that Mr. Granger was wrongly accused. But nope, this is just a video about bestiality 兽奸 in the Plymouth Colonies.

So the next time you have Thanksgiving dinner with your extended family and you run out of things to talk about, let them know no turkey was served at Thanksgiving, and ask if anybody has ever heard of Thomas Granger. And also let them know he did something with a turkey, a cow, two goats, five different sheep, and two baby cows — 21 years after the first Thanksgiving.

That's gonna do it for this video. Thank you so much for watching. Make sure you check out all the other videos, leave a comment, and subscribe. Until next time, have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天在这期乔氏制作的视频中，我们要探讨的是：你绝对想不到一个清教徒对一只火鸡做了什么——普利茅斯的故事。

当然，有很多著名的美国人。你在历史教科书中了解很多，通过看你的钱币（顺便说一句，你的钱币是种族主义的——看看我下面链接中的讽刺视频）。你甚至可能通过看一些山脉来了解著名的美国人。当然也有一些臭名昭著的美国人。比如约翰·C·卡尔霍恩，他称奴隶制为“积极的善”——当白痴们冲击国会大厦时，他的画像仍然挂在国会大厅里。甚至还有这位种族主义女士，她像其他人一样，试图阻止小石城九人组去上学。

历史上还有一些你应该知道但可能不知道的人。其中一人是托马斯·格兰杰。他犯了一种叫做鸡奸罪。当时，鸡奸被定义为违背上帝和人类意愿的非自然性行为。在我告诉你他做了什么（鸡奸涉及到……）之前，汤姆是普利茅斯殖民地最早被处死的人之一，并且是今天美国已知的第一位被判处死刑的青少年。可悲的是，即使在今天，青少年仍然在胡闹。

在普利茅斯，你可能在学校听到的关于新英格兰地区的故事是这样的：清教徒，一个在英国受迫害的群体，乘坐五月花号寻求宗教自由。这当然并不完全准确，因为这些分离主义者（他们甚至不称自己为清教徒）在荷兰已经拥有宗教自由。在前往北美洲之前，这些分离主义者已经在荷兰流亡了 10 年。他们跋涉的真正原因是，在荷兰，他们在纺织业的工资非常低。是的，他们在荷兰享有宗教自由，但他们生活贫困。身无分文可不是开玩笑的。

在五月花号上，他们在新世界建立了最早的自治协议之一。当他们到达普利茅斯时，他们的日子也并不轻松。他们确实有点幸运，因为定居者占据了一个基本上是以前的美洲原住民定居点的地方。该地区已经清理出了农田，但曾经居住在那里的美洲原住民社区却被法国探险家海难带来的疾病消灭了。

像许多殖民地一样，第一批清教徒生活艰难。最初的 102 名乘客中只有大约 50 人在第一个冬天幸存下来。幸运的是，一位名叫斯昆托的当地美洲原住民帮助了清教徒。斯昆托担任翻译，这有助于普利茅斯定居点与邻近部落之间的外交，并促进了贸易。斯昆托向殖民者展示了捕鱼的地方以及如何种植玉米。

现在，他们可能没有在学校告诉你他是如何学会说英语的。斯昆托在 1614 年被英国探险家俘虏，在西班牙被卖为奴隶，最终他到了英国，在英国待了几年学会了英语，最终获得了自由。当斯昆托在 1619 年回到新英格兰地区时，他的整个部落都死于天花。

普利茅斯殖民地和我们所有美国人都很幸运，普利茅斯殖民者与当地美洲原住民部落成为了暂时的好朋友。普利茅斯殖民地很幸运，因为如果他们没有得到帮助，死去的殖民者会多得多。而我们很幸运，因为如果没有这个历史事实，我们就不会有第一个感恩节。

到 1621 年第一次感恩节时，大约一半最初的清教徒已经去世。第一次感恩节是一个为期三天的聚会，其中包括万帕诺亚格部落的成员和幸存下来的殖民者。他们不仅感谢食物的丰盛，也感谢自己还活着。

现在，你所知道的关于第一次感恩节的大部分内容可能都是错误的。没有证据表明他们吃了火鸡，他们肯定也没有馅饼。野火鸡在该地区有，但没有证据表明它们在那次宴会上被端上餐桌。万帕诺亚格人确实带来了五只鹿作为晚餐。与流行的描绘相反，大约有 90 名当地人参加了——根据一些说法，几乎是清教徒人数的两倍。

更不用说，在 1636 年（第一次感恩节仅仅 15 年后），新英格兰地区的殖民者将与当地的佩科特部落进行一场残酷的战争。但公平地说，谁家的家庭感恩节晚餐最终不会以某种戏剧性的争吵或暴力结束呢——尤其当你的种族主义叔叔开始谈论政治的时候？

然而，清教徒和当地美洲原住民之间短暂的合作和庆祝活动是我们现在感恩节平均一天吃掉大约 5 万卡路里的原因。

当乔纳森·温思罗普领导的清教徒在 1620 年代后期建立马萨诸塞湾殖民地时，新英格兰地区继续扩张。到 1640 年代，整个新英格兰地区在“人们不再死亡”方面做得好多了。一般来说，新英格兰殖民地围绕着以家庭农场为主的小城镇发展起来。严格的清教徒社会习俗和法律使殖民地专注于其宗教使命。

但这个紧密的社群正在发生变化。一些殖民者（非常少）对殖民地的最初使命感到厌倦。醉酒、婚前性行为以及像托马斯·格兰杰这样的人引起了人们的担忧。不幸的是，我们不知道我们的男孩汤米长什么样。在本次演示中，我将使用各种可能的年轻汤米·格兰杰的近似形象。

格兰杰是普利茅斯的一个十几岁的仆人，大约 16 或 17 岁。作为一名仆人意味着他处于新英格兰殖民地社会的底层——并不太能吸引镇上的女士。虽然我们不知道他长什么样，但我们确实知道：有一天，当托马斯正在参与威廉·布拉德福德所说的“对市长的淫荡行为”时，有人抓住了他。

州长威廉·布拉德福德（他在历史上写了关于普利茅斯殖民地最权威的原始资料）在他的《普利茅斯种植园史》中记载了这起事件。他的书是了解清教徒的大部分主要来源。起初，托马斯·格兰杰使用了“含糊其辞的辩护”，否认了指控（“不是我”），但在质问以及他被当场抓获的事实面前，汤米男孩承认不仅经常和马发生性关系，还和其他一群农场动物发生了关系。

法庭记录显示，他还承认，除了市长之外，情郎托马斯还与一头牛、两只山羊、五只不同的绵羊、两只小牛和一只该死的火鸡发生了关系。我现在不确定是什么激发了年轻气盛的托马斯。也许他看到了一个让他欲火焚身的脚踝。但最终，托马斯·格兰杰因不仅与一只火鸡，而且还与许多不同的动物发生性关系而被处死。官方的法院判决是“绞刑至死”。

你可能记得当时没有超市，所以逻辑上会认为这些动物（我的意思是受害者）随后被吃掉了——但事实并非如此。记住，新英格兰殖民地非常虔诚。他们的大部分法律都来自圣经，旨在执行利未记 20 章 15 节，其中说：“人若与兽淫合，总要治死他；也要把那兽杀了。”涉案的动物在托马斯面前被宰杀，并被埋葬，因为它们已被玷污。

现在我敢打赌你正在等待这个视频将具有更深层含义的时刻——这段历史启发了动物权利，这将变成一个史诗般的爱情故事，或者格兰杰先生被错误地指控了。但都不是，这只是一个关于普利茅斯殖民地人兽交的视频。

所以下次你和你的大家庭一起吃感恩节晚餐，而你们又没话可说的时候，告诉他们感恩节没有火鸡，并问是否有人听说过托马斯·格兰杰。并且还要告诉他们，他在第一次感恩节 21 年后，与一只火鸡、一头牛、两只山羊、五只不同的绵羊和两只小牛做了某些事情。

这个视频就到这里了。非常感谢您的观看。请务必观看所有其他视频，发表评论并订阅。下次再见，祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
