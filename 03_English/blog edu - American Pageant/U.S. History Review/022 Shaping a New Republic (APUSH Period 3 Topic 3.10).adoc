What's up 怎么了, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. In this video, we're going to take a look at the first years under the Constitution 宪法, and we're going to take a look at the important events that took place in the 1790s under George Washington and John Adams.

It is during George Washington and John Adams' presidential administrations 总统任期 that various political leaders created institutions 机构和 precedents 先例 that put the ideas and principles of the Constitution into practice 付诸实践. One such precedent is the establishment of the presidential cabinet 总统内阁. The purpose of the different executive agencies 行政机构 were to advise the president.

Washington's cabinet included Thomas Jefferson that served as Secretary of State 国务卿. This position dealt largely with foreign affairs 外交事务. Another significant figure was Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton served as Secretary of the Treasury 财政部长. The job of the Treasury Department 财政部 was to handle the nation's economy.

You might recall the economy of the US was a mess. There was debt from the American Revolution, and creditors 债权人 wanted to get paid back. Not to mention, there wasn't a lot of trade going on with other nations. In response to the economic problems facing the nation, Hamilton drafted various reports to Congress that outlined his vision for an economic program that secured the financial stability 金融稳定 and credit 信用 of the new nation.

In the Report on Public Credit 公共信用报告, Hamilton advocated that the federal government should assume 承担 all of the individual state debts from the American Revolution. This plan, known as the Assumption Plan 债务承担计划, was meant to deal with the problem you can see in the graphic there. As you can see on the graphic, not only was the national government in debt, but also many states owed millions of dollars.

Under the Assumption Plan, the US government would take on the debt of the states. The idea behind this was that this would free up state money for business and trade. Another perk 好处 of this plan was the creditors -- or people who are owed money -- now have a stake 利害关系 in the success of the new nation. In addition, this act would further reinforce 加强 the power of the federal government -- something the Federalists 联邦党人 like Alexander Hamilton truly believed in.

Now this alone would not fix all of the economic problems, so in addition to the Assumption Plan, Hamilton proposed additional actions to raise revenue 增加税收. Congress passed a tariff 关税 to bring in money. A tariff is a tax on goods imported into the United States. The goal of the tariff was not only to generate revenue 创收, but by making foreign products imported into the US more expensive, the hope was this would help American manufacturers 制造商. And an excise tax 消费税 on goods such as whiskey was also passed to generate revenue.

Perhaps the most important part of Hamilton's economic vision was the creation of a national bank 国家银行. The idea behind the Bank of the United States was that revenue generated by the tariff or excise taxes on goods such as whiskey would be deposited into the First Bank of the United States. The Bank of the US would provide loans 贷款 to businesses, especially those in manufacturing 制造业 and industry 工业. And the idea behind all of this bank stuff was that the money coming in and going out will stimulate 刺激 the economy of the new nation.

Jefferson opposed Hamilton's plan, which he felt promoted urban manufacturing interests over those of the agricultural interests 农业利益. Jefferson also originally opposed the Assumption Plan because some states had already paid off their state debt, and he was worried about a powerful federal government. In addition, the creation of the national bank of the United States raised constitutional questions 宪法问题. Was the creation of the Bank of the US constitutional?

Jefferson said the national bank was unconstitutional 违宪. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution lists the enumerated powers 列举权力 of the legislative branch, and nothing in Article 1, Section 8 mentions that the legislature can create a bank. Jefferson and his supporters believed in a strict interpretation 严格解释 or strict construction 严格解释 of the Constitution. And what this meant was the government can only do what is specifically mentioned in the Constitution. Since the Constitution did not give Congress the explicit power 明确权力 to create a bank, the national government cannot do it.

Hamilton though argued that Article 1, Section 8 provided the government the power to create a bank. He argued that the national bank was necessary for dealing with the financial health 财政健康 of the nation. To defend his position, Hamilton used what is known as the Necessary and Proper Clause 必要和适当条款 to justify creation of the Bank of the US. Also known as the Elastic Clause 弹性条款, this part of the Constitution states that Congress shall have the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers that are enumerated in the Constitution.

Hamilton argued since Congress has the power to tax and regulate trade, it makes sense Congress has the power to create a national bank. Hamilton and his supporters believed in a loose construction 宽松解释. This stated the Constitution gave the federal government broad powers 广泛权力 to do what is necessary for running the country.

Ultimately, the bank issue was important not because of disagreements over the bank, but rather how different individuals interpret this new Constitution. As a result of these issues, the first party system 政党体系 would develop during the 1790s as disagreements emerged over the direction of the new nation's economic policy and debates about the power of the federal government. The two parties that will dominate this era will include the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans 民主共和党人. Hit pause to get a quick review of the big ideas we just covered.

The Whiskey Rebellion 威士忌叛乱 is another event that shows the division within the United States in the 1790s. Part of Hamilton's financial plan included an excise tax on whiskey. The purpose of this tax was to generate revenue for the federal government. In response to the excise tax, farmers in western Pennsylvania refused to pay it.

Federalists see the Whiskey Rebellion as a challenge to the authority of the new federal government and its ability to govern. For some, this was giving them flashbacks 回忆 to the failure of the Articles in dealing with Shays' Rebellion 谢斯起义. In contrast to Shays' Rebellion though, during the Whiskey Rebellion, Washington demonstrated the power of the federal government by leading thousands of troops to western Pennsylvania to stop the revolt. While critics such as Thomas Jefferson were disturbed by the use of force, this show of force 武力展示 demonstrated that this new federal government under the Constitution would be able to govern effectively.

It would not just be domestic disputes 国内争端 that would help contribute to the growth of political parties. You may recall under the Articles of Confederation, the young republic faced threats from various foreign nations. One challenge occurred when the US sought free navigation 自由航行 of the Mississippi River. You may recall under the Articles, Spain banned American shipping along the river. But a breakthrough came with Pinckney's Treaty 平克尼条约 between the US and Spain.

The treaty helped the development of US trade since Spain agreed to allow the US to use the Mississippi River and the port of New Orleans, and made the northern boundary of Florida the 31st parallel. This was a diplomatic win 外交胜利 for the young nation under George Washington.

Another big problem for the young republic was the French Revolution 法国大革命. The revolution presented challenges to the US over issues of free trade 自由贸易 and foreign policy 外交政策. The overthrow of King Louis was initially supported by many Americans, but the Reign of Terror 恐怖统治 and France fighting darn near the rest of Europe made some rethink their support for the French Revolution.

Washington's own cabinet was split over the French Revolution. His Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was all about supporting the French. Jefferson felt the Enlightenment ideas 启蒙思想 and the formation of another republic was a good thing for both countries. Not to mention, the French helped us during the American Revolution, so it was only fair that we returned the favor 回报恩惠.

Opposition to the French Revolution was led by Alexander Hamilton. In his mind, the revolution was way more radical than we were comfortable with. You know, the Reign of Terror -- heads were being chopped off -- and starting in 1792, France was fighting most of the monarchies 君主制国家 of Europe, including Great Britain. Folks like Hamilton worried that this fighting would disrupt trade.

During this time, France attempted to restart the Franco-American alliance 法美联盟, and in response, Washington issued the Neutrality Proclamation of 1793 中立宣言. In it, he said the US would be neutral, and the rationale 理由是 we are a young nation -- the last thing we need is getting into one of Europe's wars. These challenges further fueled political disagreements over the best way to respond to both the French Revolution and the war that followed.

While these issues with France and Spain were going on, George Washington also had to deal with estranged former mama Great Britain. As US settlers migrated west beyond the Appalachian Mountains, they came into contact with British threats. Britain openly defied 公然违抗 the peace treaty of 1783 by maintaining a chain of forts 要塞 on US soil. While there, the British sold firearms to local Indian tribes that would then be used to pose a threat to American settlers on the frontier.

The presence of the British on North American soil was seen as a threat to American settlement and peace out in the west. Not to mention, in the 1790s, both England and France began impressing 强征 US ships and sailors. Neither side liked that we were neutral and sought to trade with both countries, so they began taking our ships.

In the midst of all this, Chief Justice John Jay was sent to negotiate with Great Britain to preserve US neutrality and deal with this threat. The result of that meeting was Jay's Treaty of 1794 杰伊条约. While Britain did agree to leave the forts they occupied on American soil, they don't really do this in a timely manner, and Jay's Treaty said nothing about Great Britain stopping the harassment 骚扰 of American ships.

Jay's Treaty was celebrated by Federalists for keeping the US neutral, but condemned 谴责 by many others, including the Jeffersonians, for not really addressing the problems between the US and Great Britain.

By 1796, George decided to leave the presidency, and in doing so began the tradition of the Farewell Address 告别演说. In leaving office after two terms, Washington established another precedent of voluntarily stepping down 自愿离职 from the presidency after two terms. Washington felt it was important to step aside because the Constitution created a republic, and serving too long may seem to like a king. Plus, he was old and wants to just go and chill in Mount Vernon.

In Washington's Farewell Address, he encouraged national unity 国家统一 and warned the nation against political factions 政治派系. And Washington also warned about the dangers of permanent foreign alliances 永久性外国联盟. This tradition of avoiding entangling alliances 避免纠缠不清的联盟 with Europe will be followed by subsequent presidential administrations.

Following George Washington's retirement, fellow Federalist John Adams is elected president. And like Washington, Adams had to deal with violations to American neutrality as both France and Great Britain continued to seize American ships. Adams wanted to avoid a war with France and set US diplomats to France to negotiate. However, French officials known as X, Y, and Z attempted to get the Americans to bribe 贿赂 them in order to start negotiations with Foreign Minister Talleyrand.

This incident, known as the XYZ Affair XYZ事件, outraged 激怒 many Americans. As a result, an undeclared naval war 未宣战的海战 between the US and France began known as the Quasi-War 准战争. And in our next video, I'll take a look at what happens after the XYZ Affair. Until next time, thanks for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。在这个视频中，我们将了解宪法实施的最初几年，并回顾一下乔治·华盛顿和约翰·亚当斯执政时期 1790 年代发生的重要事件。

正是在乔治·华盛顿和约翰·亚当斯的总统执政期间，各位政治领导人创建了各种机构和先例，将宪法的思想和原则付诸实践。总统内阁的建立就是这样一个先例。不同行政机构的目的是为总统提供建议。

华盛顿的内阁包括担任国务卿的托马斯·杰斐逊。这个职位主要处理外交事务。另一位重要人物是亚历山大·汉密尔顿。汉密尔顿担任财政部长。财政部的职责是处理国家经济。

你可能还记得美国的经济一团糟。美国革命留下了债务，债权人希望得到偿还。更不用说，与其他国家的贸易往来不多。为了应对国家面临的经济问题，汉密尔顿向国会提交了各种报告，概述了他旨在确保新国家金融稳定和信用的经济计划愿景。

在《公共信用报告》中，汉密尔顿主张联邦政府应承担美国革命期间所有州的个人债务。这项被称为“承担计划”的计划旨在解决你在图表中看到的问题。正如你在图表中看到的，不仅国家政府负债累累，而且许多州也欠下了数百万美元。

根据“承担计划”，美国政府将承担各州的债务。其背后的想法是，这将释放各州的资金用于商业和贸易。该计划的另一个好处是，债权人——或被欠款的人——现在在新国家的成功中拥有了既得利益。此外，这项行动将进一步加强联邦政府的权力——这是像亚历山大·汉密尔顿这样的联邦主义者真正相信的。

仅仅这样并不能解决所有的经济问题，因此除了“承担计划”之外，汉密尔顿还提出了增加收入的额外措施。国会通过了一项关税法案以增加收入。关税是对进口到美国的商品征收的税。关税的目标不仅是增加收入，而且通过提高进口到美国的外国产品的价格，希望能够帮助美国制造商。此外，还通过了一项对威士忌等商品征收的消费税以增加收入。

汉密尔顿经济愿景中也许最重要的一部分是创建国家银行。美国银行背后的想法是，关税或威士忌等商品消费税产生的收入将存入美国第一银行。美国银行将向企业，特别是制造业和工业企业提供贷款。所有这些银行措施背后的想法是，资金的流入和流出将刺激新国家的经济。

杰斐逊反对汉密尔顿的计划，他认为该计划优先考虑城市制造业的利益，而不是农业的利益。杰斐逊最初也反对“承担计划”，因为一些州已经偿还了他们的州债务，他担心强大的联邦政府。此外，建立美国国家银行引发了宪法问题。建立美国银行是否符合宪法？

杰斐逊认为国家银行违宪。宪法第一条第八款列出了立法部门的列举权力，而第一条第八款中没有任何内容提到立法机构可以创建银行。杰斐逊及其支持者信奉对宪法的严格解释或严格建构。这意味着政府只能做宪法中明确提到的事情。由于宪法没有明确赋予国会创建银行的权力，因此国家政府不能这样做。

然而，汉密尔顿认为，宪法第一条第八款赋予了政府创建银行的权力。他认为，国家银行对于处理国家的财政健康是必要的。为了捍卫自己的立场，汉密尔顿使用了所谓的“必要且适当条款”来证明创建美国银行的合理性。宪法的这一部分也被称为“弹性条款”，规定国会有权制定为执行宪法中列举的权力所必需和适当的所有法律。

汉密尔顿认为，既然国会有权征税和 регулировать 贸易，那么国会有权创建国家银行是合理的。汉密尔顿及其支持者信奉对宪法的宽松解释。这表明宪法赋予联邦政府广泛的权力来做管理国家所必需的事情。

最终，银行问题的重要性不在于对银行本身的分歧，而在于不同的人如何解释这部新宪法。由于这些问题，第一个政党体系在 1790 年代形成，因为在新国家的经济政策方向以及关于联邦政府权力的辩论中出现了分歧。主导这个时代的两个政党将包括联邦党和民主共和党。暂停视频，快速回顾一下我们刚才讨论的要点。

威士忌叛乱是另一个表明 1790 年代美国国内分裂的事件。汉密尔顿的财政计划的一部分包括对威士忌征收消费税。这项税收的目的是为联邦政府增加收入。为了回应这项消费税，宾夕法尼亚州西部的农民拒绝支付。

联邦主义者将威士忌叛乱视为对新联邦政府权威及其治理能力的挑战。对一些人来说，这让他们回想起了邦联条例在处理谢司叛乱时的失败。然而，与谢司叛乱不同的是，在威士忌叛乱期间，华盛顿率领数千名士兵前往宾夕法尼亚西部镇压叛乱，展示了联邦政府的权力。虽然托马斯·杰斐逊等批评家对武力的使用感到不安，但这种武力的展示表明，宪法下的这个新联邦政府将能够有效地进行治理。

不仅国内争端促成了政党的形成。你可能还记得，在邦联条例下，这个年轻的共和国面临着来自各个外国的威胁。其中一个挑战发生在当美国寻求密西西比河的自由航行权时。你可能还记得，在邦联条例下，西班牙禁止美国船只沿河航行。但美国和西班牙之间的皮克尼条约取得了一项突破。

该条约帮助了美国贸易的发展，因为西班牙同意允许美国使用密西西比河和新奥尔良港，并将佛罗里达的北部边界定为北纬 31 度。这对乔治·华盛顿领导下的这个年轻国家来说是一次外交胜利。

这个年轻共和国的另一个大问题是法国大革命。这场革命给美国带来了关于自由贸易和外交政策的挑战。推翻路易国王最初得到了许多美国人的支持，但恐怖统治和法国几乎与欧洲其他国家作战，使一些人重新考虑他们对法国大革命的支持。

华盛顿自己的内阁在法国大革命问题上存在分歧。他的国务卿托马斯·杰斐逊全力支持法国。杰斐逊认为启蒙思想和另一个共和国的建立对两国都有好处。更不用说，法国在美国革命期间帮助了我们，所以我们回报这份恩情是公平的。

反对法国大革命的是亚历山大·汉密尔顿。在他看来，这场革命比我们能够接受的要激进得多。你知道，恐怖统治——人头落地——而且从 1792 年开始，法国与欧洲大部分君主制国家作战，包括英国。像汉密尔顿这样的人担心这场战争会扰乱贸易。

在此期间，法国试图重建法美同盟，作为回应，华盛顿于 1793 年发布了中立宣言。他在宣言中表示美国将保持中立，理由是我们是一个年轻的国家——我们最不需要的就是卷入欧洲的战争。这些挑战进一步加剧了关于如何最好地应对法国大革命及其后战争的政治分歧。

在与法国和西班牙发生这些问题的同时，乔治·华盛顿还不得不处理与疏远的前宗主国英国的关系。随着美国定居者向阿巴拉契亚山脉以西迁移，他们遇到了来自英国的威胁。英国公开蔑视 1783 年的和平条约，在美国领土上维持一系列堡垒。在那里，英国向当地印第安部落出售枪支，这些枪支随后被用来威胁边境地区的美国定居者。

英国在北美洲的存在被视为对美国西部定居和和平的威胁。更不用说，在 1790 年代，英国和法国都开始扣押美国船只和水手。双方都不喜欢我们保持中立并试图与两国进行贸易，因此他们开始夺取我们的船只。

在这一切之中，首席大法官约翰·杰伊被派往与英国谈判，以维护美国的中立并处理这一威胁。那次会议的结果是 1794 年的杰伊条约。虽然英国确实同意离开他们在美国领土上占领的堡垒，但他们并没有及时这样做，而且杰伊条约对英国停止骚扰美国船只只字未提。

杰伊条约因保持美国中立而受到联邦主义者的赞扬，但因未能真正解决美国和英国之间的问题而受到包括杰斐逊主义者在内的许多人的谴责。

到 1796 年，乔治决定卸任总统，并由此开始了发表告别演说的传统。在两届任期结束后卸任，华盛顿树立了自愿在两届任期后卸任总统的又一个先例。华盛顿认为，宪法建立了一个共和国，任职时间过长可能看起来像国王，因此有必要退位。此外，他年事已高，只想回弗农山庄休息。

在华盛顿的告别演说中，他鼓励民族团结，并警告国家警惕政治派别。华盛顿还警告说，永久性的外国联盟存在危险。避免与欧洲建立纠缠不清的联盟的这一传统将被后来的总统政府所遵循。

乔治·华盛顿退休后，联邦党同僚约翰·亚当斯当选总统。像华盛顿一样，亚当斯不得不处理法国和英国继续扣押美国船只而侵犯美国中立的问题。亚当斯希望避免与法国开战，并派遣美国外交官前往法国进行谈判。然而，被称为 X、Y 和 Z 的法国官员试图让美国人贿赂他们，以便开始与外交部长塔列朗的谈判。

这一事件，即 XYZ 事件，激怒了许多美国人。结果，美国和法国之间爆发了一场未宣战的海战，史称准战争。在我们的下一个视频中，我将探讨 XYZ 事件之后发生的事情。下次再见，感谢观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！

What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. In this video, we're going to take a look at the first years under the Constitution, and we're going to take a look at the important events that took place in the 1790s under George Washington and John Adams.

It is during George Washington and John Adams' presidential administrations that various political leaders created institutions and precedents that put the ideas and principles of the Constitution into practice. One such precedent is the establishment of the presidential cabinet. The purpose of the different executive agencies were to advise the president.

Washington's cabinet included Thomas Jefferson that served as Secretary of State. This position dealt largely with foreign affairs. Another significant figure was Alexander Hamilton.

Not to mention, there wasn't a lot of trade going on with other nations. In response to the economic problems facing the nation, Hamilton drafted various reports to Congress that outlined his vision for an economic program that secured the financial stability and credit of the new nation.

In the Report on Public Credit, Hamilton advocated that the federal government should assume all of the individual state debts from the American Revolution. This plan, known as the Assumption Plan, was meant to deal with the problem you can see in the graphic there. As you can see on the graphic, not only was the national government in debt, but also many states owed millions of dollars.

Under the Assumption Plan, the US government would take on the debt of the states. The idea behind this was that this would free up state money for business and trade.

Perhaps the most important part of Hamilton's economic vision was the creation of a national bank. The idea behind the Bank of the United States was that revenue generated by the tariff or excise taxes on goods such as whiskey would be deposited into the First Bank of the United States. The Bank of the US would provide loans to businesses, especially those in manufacturing and industry. And the idea behind all of this bank stuff was that the money coming in and going out will stimulate the economy of the new nation.

Jefferson opposed Hamilton's plan, which he felt promoted urban manufacturing interests over those of the agricultural interests. Jefferson also originally opposed the Assumption Plan because some states had already paid off their state debt, and he was worried about a powerful federal government. In addition, the creation of the national bank of the United States raised constitutional questions. Was the creation of the Bank of the US constitutional?

Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution lists the enumerated powers of the legislative branch, and nothing in Article 1, Section 8 mentions that the legislature can create a bank. Jefferson and his supporters believed in a strict interpretation or strict construction of the Constitution. And what this meant was the government can only do what is specifically mentioned in the Constitution. Since the Constitution did not give Congress the explicit power to create a bank, the national government cannot do it.

Hamilton though argued that Article 1, Section 8 provided the government the power to create a bank. He argued that the national bank was necessary for dealing with the financial health of the nation. To defend his position, Hamilton used what is known as the Necessary and Proper Clause to justify creation of the Bank of the US. Also known as the Elastic Clause, this part of the Constitution states that Congress shall have the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers that are enumerated in the Constitution.

Hamilton argued since Congress has the power to tax and regulate trade, it makes sense Congress has the power to create a national bank. Hamilton and his supporters believed in a loose construction. This stated the Constitution gave the federal government broad powers to do what is necessary for running the country.

Ultimately, the bank issue was important not because of disagreements over the bank, but rather how different individuals interpret this new Constitution.

The two parties that will dominate this era will include the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans. Hit pause to get a quick review of the big ideas we just covered.

The Whiskey Rebellion is another event that shows the division within the United States in the 1790s. Part of Hamilton's financial plan included an excise tax on whiskey. The purpose of this tax was to generate revenue for the federal government. In response to the excise tax, farmers in western Pennsylvania refused to pay it.

Federalists see the Whiskey Rebellion as a challenge to the authority of the new federal government and its ability to govern. For some, this was giving them flashbacks to the failure of the Articles in dealing with Shays' Rebellion. In contrast to Shays' Rebellion though, during the Whiskey Rebellion, Washington demonstrated the power of the federal government by leading thousands of troops to western Pennsylvania to stop the revolt. While critics such as Thomas Jefferson were disturbed by the use of force, this show of force demonstrated that this new federal government under the Constitution would be able to govern effectively.

Plus, he was old and wants to just go and chill in Mount Vernon.

In Washington's Farewell Address, he encouraged national unity and warned the nation against political factions. And Washington also warned about the dangers of permanent foreign alliances. This tradition of avoiding entangling alliances with Europe will be followed by subsequent presidential administrations.

Following George Washington's retirement, fellow Federalist John Adams is elected president. And like Washington, Adams had to deal with violations to American neutrality as both France and Great Britain continued to seize American ships. Adams wanted to avoid a war with France and set US diplomats to France to negotiate. However, French officials known as X, Y, and Z attempted to get the Americans to bribe them in order to start negotiations with Foreign Minister Talleyrand.

This incident, known as the XYZ Affair, outraged many Americans. As a result, an undeclared naval war between the US and France began known as the Quasi-War. And in our next video, I'll take a look at what happens after the XYZ Affair. Until next time, thanks for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!
