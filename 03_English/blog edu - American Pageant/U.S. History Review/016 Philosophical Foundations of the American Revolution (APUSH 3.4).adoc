What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. In this video, I'm going to take a quick look at the philosophical 哲学的 foundations of the American Revolution -- or basically, we're going to take a look at how and why colonial attitudes about government and the individual changed in the years leading up to the American Revolution.

Remember, in this early period, there's no unified 统一的；一致的 opinion in the colonies about independence, or even what liberty 自由 means, or what type of representative government is best. Even when the colonies got together, they were overwhelmingly 压倒性地 focused on getting their grievances 不满；牢骚 addressed and repeatedly pledged their loyalty to Britain.

When shots are fired at Lexington and Concord in April of 1775, I mean people are dying at this point, and yet a few months later, the Olive Branch Petition was adopted by the Second Continental Congress in July of 1775. So today we're looking at what changed.

You might recall the Great Awakening of the 1730s and 40s did have an impact on revolutionary thought of the time period -- so this is way before all these events are taking place. The Great Awakening was an anti-elitist 反精英主义的 movement. People learned to question authority, and there was an increased emphasis on the individual. For some colonists, religion played a strong role in developing their world view.

Remember, John Winthrop helped establish the New England colonies to create this model society for the rest of the world to look up to. During the Great Awakening, the religious diversity 多样性 of the colonies increased, and in some cases, religion strengthened Americans' view of themselves as a people blessed with liberty. People began to think maybe we didn't need to follow in the old ways of Europe, and in these 13 colonies they can carve out 开辟；开创 a new path.

One thing I've also already covered is that the Enlightenment ideas and philosophy inspired many American political thinkers to emphasize individual talent over hereditary privilege 世袭特权. Enlightenment thinking had an impact on colonial thinking and their relationship to Britain. Enlightenment thinkers began to question the divine right of kings 君权神授 and the notion of the monarchy exercising absolute power 绝对权力.

Another item that began to be questioned by Enlightenment thinkers is this process where rulers would hand down power to family members -- because we know in the United States, the only royalty we recognize is this queen. So the Enlightenment inspired colonists to rethink ideas about the rights of individuals, the rights they should have as British citizens, and ideas about republican self-government 共和自治.

What this means was that citizens had the right to elect representatives who would act directly on their behalf. An important idea inspiring calls for independence was the colonial belief in the superiority 优越性 of republican forms of government -- that old monarchy stuff in Europe is trash.

An essential component 组成部分 of a republican form of government was the idea that individuals have natural rights 自然权利. These rights are not given to them by the government. John Locke wrote about natural rights ordained 授予；规定 by God. Essential to this belief is the idea that no government can take these rights away from an individual -- since government did not give those rights to people, those rights are mine. Among these natural rights were life, liberty and property.

The stud muffin of the Enlightenment, Rousseau, wrote about the social contract 社会契约. The purpose of government was to protect individual natural rights, and a government gets its right to exist and govern a society based on the consent of the governed 被统治者的同意. Basically, the Enlightenment said to people: the purpose of government was to protect people's natural rights of life, liberty and property. If government did not protect these rights, it could be abolished 废除.

If the view of many of the individuals meeting with one another is that the actions of the British monarchy and Parliament were infringing on 侵犯 the colonists' political and economic rights, the move to independence makes perfect sense. Still, in 1775, colonial leaders still do not have a clear consensus 共识 for independence. Some more radical 激进的 colonists -- members of the Sons of Liberty -- do want to take this next step, but regular colonists are not sitting on the porch drinking tea reading Enlightenment thinkers.

So how does this idea of independence reach the masses -- the regular folk, the Joe Six-Packs of the colonies -- and become a thing that more people want? Enter T. Paine. Thomas Paine comes to the colonies in 1774. Unlike the T-Pain of today who drops albums with songs about drinks, love and strippers, the historical T-Paine drops a political pamphlet 小册子 in January of 1776: Common Sense.

The pamphlet made the case for independence in concise 简明的，easy to understand language that was heavily influenced by Enlightenment ideas. Paine argued that the colonies were being exploited 剥削 by Britain -- remember, the colonies existed to basically enrich the mother country. He also states the monarchy is trash -- the divine right of the monarchy was no longer acceptable in this Enlightenment world that we're living in. And finally, in Common Sense, he also states colonial rights were being violated 侵犯.

Thomas Paine's Common Sense brought many of the ideas of republican forms of government to the masses. T-Paine was good with them words, wrote in plain language, and broke down arguments for independence in a way that working-class colonists could easily understand. As a result, the pamphlet was widely shared throughout the colonies.

There's a lot of stuff happening just before 1776 and the publication of Common Sense, as well in July of that same year of the Declaration of Independence. Up until June of 1776, the Second Continental Congress continued to debate independence. In June, Richard Henry Lee in the Second Continental Congress introduced a resolution 决议 calling for the colonies to state their independence. They still needed to declare independence, so the task of writing an actual declaration fell to one of the many guys who owned slaves: Thomas Jefferson.

The Declaration of Independence was largely authored 撰写 by Jefferson, although others did chip in. The Declaration of Independence attempted to sell the colonists on the idea of independence. TJ filled that bad boy up with loads of Enlightenment ideas -- social contract, natural rights -- but he didn't want to get caught plagiarizing 剽窃，so he replaced "life, liberty and property" with "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." We all deserve to be happy.

Another purpose of the Declaration of Independence was to try to convince other countries to support the colonial cause. Getting not only recognition 承认 but also support from foreign nations will prove very important to the colonial movement. To achieve these goals, a long list of grievances against the king were included in the document. Basically, much of the Declaration is a list of reasons why we are breaking up with Britain. This long list of grievances sought to justify 证明…… 有理 the colonial cause for independence.

Ideals such as those listed on the screen were some of the ideas discussed in some of these founding documents such as Common Sense and the Declaration. And ideas in these documents will not only resonate 产生共鸣 throughout American history but will be debated and challenged even today. While many would argue the nation was founded on these ideals, even today we don't agree on their meaning, and definitely not everyone will get to enjoy all of these rights and freedoms.

The ideas and arguments found in the Declaration and other founding documents were not intended for various groups -- women, African-Americans (free or those who are enslaved), and definitely not Native Americans. But groups would use the ideals and arguments found in documents such as the Declaration of Independence in their struggle at advancing opportunities in rights in American society. The rhetoric 修辞；言辞 of these founding documents will be used throughout American history.

But what is important to note: throughout the 1760s and 1770s, an ideology 意识形态 was developing amongst colonists, and there were slow steps towards independence. The colonists went from 1763 to 1776 increasingly questioning British policies to actually declaring independence by July of 1776.

In our next video, I will explain the important stuff you should know about the American Revolution. And that's gonna do it for today. Thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。在这个视频中，我将快速浏览一下美国革命的哲学基础——或者基本上，我们将看看在导致美国革命的那些年里，殖民地人民关于政府和个人的态度是如何以及为何发生变化的。

记住，在这个早期阶段，殖民地人民对于独立、甚至自由的含义、或者哪种类型的代议制政府最好，并没有统一的意见。即使殖民地联合起来，他们也绝大多数专注于解决他们的不满，并一再向英国宣誓效忠。

当 1775 年 4 月在列克星敦和康科德打响枪声时，我的意思是那时已经有人死亡了，然而几个月后，第二次大陆会议于 1775 年 7 月通过了《橄榄枝请愿书》。所以今天我们来看看是什么发生了变化。

你可能还记得 1730 和 40 年代的大觉醒运动确实对当时的革命思想产生了影响——这远在所有这些事件发生之前。大觉醒运动是一场反精英主义的运动。人们学会了质疑权威，对个人的强调也增加了。对于一些殖民者来说，宗教在塑造他们的世界观方面发挥了重要作用。

记住，约翰·温思罗普帮助建立了新英格兰殖民地，目的是为世界其他地方树立一个值得效仿的模范社会。在大觉醒运动期间，殖民地的宗教多样性增加了，在某些情况下，宗教加强了美国人对自己作为一群被赋予自由的人民的看法。人们开始认为也许我们不需要遵循欧洲的旧方式，在这 13 个殖民地，他们可以开辟一条新的道路。

我已经介绍过的另一件事是，启蒙思想和哲学激发了许多美国政治思想家强调个人才能而不是世袭特权。启蒙思想对殖民地的思想及其与英国的关系产生了影响。启蒙思想家开始质疑君权神授和君主行使绝对权力的观念。

启蒙思想家开始质疑的另一个问题是统治者将权力传给家庭成员的过程——因为我们知道在美国，我们唯一承认的皇室就是这位女王。因此，启蒙运动促使殖民者重新思考个人权利、他们作为英国公民应该享有的权利以及关于共和自治的思想。

这意味着公民有权选举直接代表他们行事的代表。激发独立呼声的一个重要思想是殖民地人民对共和政体优越性的信念——欧洲那些旧的君主制是垃圾。

共和政体的一个重要组成部分是个人拥有自然权利的观念。这些权利不是政府赋予他们的。约翰·洛克写了上帝赋予的自然权利。这种信念的关键在于，没有任何政府可以剥夺个人的这些权利——因为政府没有赋予人民这些权利，所以这些权利是我的。在这些自然权利中，包括生命、自由和财产。

启蒙运动的魅力人物卢梭写了关于社会契约的文章。政府的目的是保护个人的自然权利，政府的存在和统治社会的权利来自于被统治者的同意。基本上，启蒙运动对人们说：政府的目的是保护人们的生命、自由和财产的自然权利。如果政府不保护这些权利，就可以被废除。

如果许多彼此会面的人认为英国君主和议会的行为侵犯了殖民者的政治和经济权利，那么走向独立就完全合乎逻辑了。然而，在 1775 年，殖民地领导人仍然没有就独立达成明确的共识。一些更激进的殖民者——自由之子会的成员——确实想要采取下一步行动，但普通的殖民者并没有坐在门廊上喝茶，阅读启蒙思想家的著作。

那么，独立的想法是如何传播到大众——普通的民众，殖民地的平民百姓——并成为更多人想要的东西的呢？托马斯·潘恩登场了。托马斯·潘恩于 1774 年来到殖民地。不像今天的 T-Pain 发行关于饮料、爱情和脱衣舞女的歌曲专辑，历史上的 T-潘恩在 1776 年 1 月发行了一本政治小册子：《常识》。

这本小册子以简洁易懂的语言阐述了独立的理由，其深受启蒙思想的影响。潘恩认为殖民地正受到英国的剥削——记住，殖民地的存在基本上是为了使宗主国富裕。他还声明君主制是垃圾——在我们所生活的这个启蒙世界中，君权神授不再可以接受。最后，在《常识》中，他还指出殖民地的权利受到了侵犯。

托马斯·潘恩的《常识》将许多共和政体的思想带给了大众。T-潘恩擅长文字，用平白的语言写作，并以工人阶级殖民者容易理解的方式阐述了独立的论据。结果，这本小册子在整个殖民地广泛传播。

在 1776 年和《常识》出版之前，以及同年 7 月《独立宣言》发表之前，发生了很多事情。直到 1776 年 6 月，第二次大陆会议仍在继续辩论独立问题。6 月，理查德·亨利·李在第二次大陆会议上提出了一项决议，呼吁各殖民地宣布独立。他们仍然需要宣布独立，因此撰写实际宣言的任务落到了众多拥有奴隶的人之一身上：托马斯·杰斐逊。

《独立宣言》主要由杰斐逊撰写，尽管其他人也参与其中。《独立宣言》试图向殖民者推销独立的想法。TJ 在那份糟糕的文件中塞满了启蒙思想——社会契约、自然权利——但他不想被指控抄袭，所以他用“生命、自由和追求幸福”取代了“生命、自由和财产”。我们都应该幸福。

《独立宣言》的另一个目的是试图说服其他国家支持殖民事业。获得外国的承认和支持对殖民运动来说都非常重要。为了实现这些目标，文件中列出了针对国王的一长串不满。基本上，《宣言》的大部分内容都是我们与英国决裂的原因清单。这份长长的 grievances 清单旨在为殖民地争取独立的理由辩护。

屏幕上列出的这些理想是《常识》和《宣言》等一些开国文献中讨论的一些思想。这些文献中的思想不仅将在美国历史上产生共鸣，而且即使在今天也会受到辩论和挑战。虽然许多人会认为这个国家是建立在这些理想之上的，但即使在今天，我们对它们的含义也没有达成一致，而且肯定不是每个人都能享受到所有这些权利和自由。

《宣言》和其他开国文献中的思想和论点并非针对各个群体——妇女、非裔美国人（无论是自由人还是被奴役者），当然也不是针对美洲原住民。但各个群体将在他们争取在美国社会获得更多权利机会的斗争中，利用《独立宣言》等文献中的理想和论点。这些开国文献的措辞将在整个美国历史上被使用。

但需要注意的是：在整个 1760 年代和 1770 年代，一种意识形态在殖民者中发展起来，并且朝着独立迈出了缓慢的步伐。殖民者从 1763 年到 1776 年越来越质疑英国的政策，最终在 1776 年 7 月宣布独立。

在我们的下一个视频中，我将解释你应该了解的关于美国革命的重要内容。今天就到这里。非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
