What's up 怎么了, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're covering the rise of political parties 政党崛起 in the era of Thomas Jefferson 托马斯·杰斐逊时代.

In the election of 1800, the Federalists 联邦党人 lost control of both the executive 行政的 and legislative branches 立法部门. You might recall in the 1790s, the two-party system 两党制 of Federalists and Democratic-Republicans 民主共和党人 emerged. The two parties had very different views about the power of the federal government and how the Constitution should be interpreted 解释 and implemented 实施.

In the election of 1800, Thomas Jefferson becomes the first ever Democratic-Republican elected president. What was significant about the election of 1800 was that it marked the first peaceful transfer of power 和平权力移交 between political parties under the Constitution. Although the Federalists will never hold majorities in Congress or the presidency after 1800, in the early 1800s national political parties continued to debate issues such as the tariff 关税, the powers of the federal government, and relations with European powers. So there are still going to be disagreements between the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans in spite of the Federalists fading away 逐渐消失 and the Democratic-Republican party taking control.

The Supreme Court under John Marshall increased the power of the federal government in the early 19th century. The case of Marbury vs Madison established the principle of judicial review 司法审查. In McCulloch vs Maryland, the court ruled the Second Bank of the U.S. is constitutional 符合宪法的. And in Gibbons versus Ogden, the court ruled states do not regulate interstate commerce 州际贸易 -- the federal government does.

Now that you know what the Supreme Court does during this time, you should also know how Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans will govern. Jefferson's party were advocates of a strict interpretation 严格解释 of the Constitution, limited power for the federal government, and Jefferson favored an agrarian vision 农业愿景 for the country. To that end, Jefferson and his party allowed the Sedition Act 煽动叛乱法 to expire 失效, reduced the size of the military, and eliminated the excise tax 消费税 on things like whiskey.

Things that Jefferson did that did not align to his party's beliefs include Jefferson will keep the Bank of the United States, and he used a loose interpretation 宽松解释 of the Constitution to make the Louisiana Purchase 路易斯安那购地案. Jefferson will use Federalist principles to buy the Louisiana Territory. Jefferson had his reasons for abandoning his constitutional principles when making the Louisiana Purchase. One was all that land would allow him to fulfill the goal of an agrarian society 农业社会 by making abundant land available to future generations -- because you know Jefferson's all about that. And by getting that land from France, the U.S. could prevent a potentially hostile country 潜在敌对国 from being right on its doorstep 家门口. And by buying this land, farmers in the West would get access to the Mississippi River.

Some background to the purchase: Jefferson sent James Monroe to Paris to try to buy New Orleans from France -- just that territory you see in the blue. And very quickly, Napoleon offered to sell all of the Louisiana Territory for 15 million dollars. This was made possible by the failure of Napoleon's forces to suppress 镇压 a slave revolt 奴隶起义 in Haiti. Napoleon needed money, and France was dealing with the Haitian Revolution 海地革命 since 1791, which unfortunately for Napoleon by 1804 Haiti will be independent. And Napoleon had a lot of enemies in Europe and he needs money for the war. In 1803, Napoleon would rather have the 15 million dollars than a bunch of land in North America.

The Louisiana Purchase was a diplomatic success 外交胜利, giving the U.S. additional influence and control over North America. And in 1804, Lewis and Clark led a scientific exploration 科学考察 of the trans-Mississippi West 密西西比河以西地区 that was just purchased.

Jefferson also had to deal with the continued war between England and France, which led to violations of American neutrality 违反美国中立. Both France and England violated American neutrality under both Federalist and Democratic-Republican presidents. During Jefferson's second term, Tommy found it very difficult to get both England and France to stop attacking U.S. ships. I love how small Napoleon is in this political cartoon 政治漫画.

Tensions escalated dramatically 紧张局势急剧升级 in 1807 when the British ship Leopard attacked an American ship the Chesapeake. This attack led to the death of three Americans, and the Chesapeake-Leopard affair 切萨皮克-豹号事件 led to a lot of Americans demanding that Jefferson defend American honor with a declaration of war 宣战. Jefferson instead called for the Embargo Act of 1807 1807年禁运法案. The act banned all U.S. trade with the hopes that this would prevent our ships from being taken over. Sadly, the embargo was a disaster. Merchants in the U.S. smuggled goods 走私货物 and continued to trade with Europe, and the embargo hurt the U.S. economy more than it did France or Great Britain.

In 1808, President Madison easily wins the election and inherits 继承 the challenge of trying to keep the U.S. neutral. Sadly, a bunch of other things done to try to maintain American neutrality do not really have the results U.S. policymakers 政策制定者 were hoping for. The British and French continued to impress 强征 American ships and sailors. And in 1810, young Southerners and Westerners were elected to Congress known as War Hawks 鹰派 who advocated for war against England. They saw war as the best way to stop British harassment 骚扰 of American shipping and to defend U.S. honor. They also saw war against Great Britain as a way to wipe out 消灭 American Indian resistance 抵抗 on the frontier. Remember, Great Britain was trading weapons to American Indians in the Northwest, and some War Hawks saw war with Great Britain as a way to try to take Canada for the United States -- national expansion 国家扩张, baby.

Madison would ask Congress for a declaration of war against England in 1812, and there you got it ladies and gentlemen -- America's first declared war: the War of 1812 1812年战争. The reasons given by Madison for the declaration of war include what you see right there, but also factoring into the decision were the continued presence of British forts 要塞 on U.S. soil, the fact that Tecumseh and other American Indians were supported by the British, and calls to acquire Canada from Great Britain.

The U.S. had a small navy and poorly trained army when the war began, and the war went pretty badly in its early years. A few highlights: In August of 1814, British troops rolled into 入侵 Washington and set fire to 放火烧毁 the U.S. Capitol, the President's Mansion, and a whole bunch of other buildings. Another important moment as the British attacked Fort McHenry -- Francis Scott Key wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner 星条旗." You know, because the flag was still there.

Eventually the war would come to an end with the Treaty of Ghent 根特条约 in 1814. Neither country won militarily, but Great Britain had better things to do than fight their former children again. Before news of the end of the war reached the battlefield, the U.S. military under Andrew Jackson won the Battle of New Orleans 新奥尔良战役. Following the War of 1812, Andrew Jackson emerged as a war hero 战争英雄. I wonder if we'll ever hear about this guy in the near future.

And finally, during the War of 1812, radical New England Federalists met at the Hartford Convention 哈特福德会议 and considered possibly leaving the union 脱离联邦. Bad move, dude. Following the war there will be a surge of nationalism 民族主义高涨 -- don't forget we owe allegiance to no crown 不效忠任何王权 -- and with the death of the Federalist party after the Hartford Convention, the country will enter what is known as the Era of Good Feelings 和睦时期 in which there will be only one political party -- the Democratic-Republican party.

In my next video, I'm going to take a look at the American System 美国体系 and Henry Clay 亨利·克莱, and I will talk about some of the disagreements that occurred amongst Democratic-Republicans during this so-called Era of Good Feelings. Until next time, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们来探讨托马斯·杰斐逊时代政党的崛起。

在 1800 年的选举中，联邦党失去了对行政和立法部门的控制权。你可能还记得，在 1790 年代，联邦党和民主共和党这两个政党体系开始形成。这两个政党对联邦政府的权力和宪法的解释和实施方式有着截然不同的看法。

在 1800 年的选举中，托马斯·杰斐逊成为有史以来第一位当选总统的民主共和党人。1800 年大选的重大意义在于，它标志着宪法下政党之间首次和平的权力交接。尽管联邦党在 1800 年之后再也没有在国会或总统职位上占据多数席位，但在 1800 年代初期，国家政党继续就关税、联邦政府的权力以及与欧洲列强的关系等问题展开辩论。因此，尽管联邦党逐渐衰落，民主共和党掌控大局，但联邦党和民主共和党之间仍然存在分歧。

19 世纪初，约翰·马歇尔领导下的最高法院增加了联邦政府的权力。马伯里诉麦迪逊案确立了司法审查原则。在麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案中，法院裁定美国第二银行合宪。而在吉本斯诉奥格登案中，法院裁定各州不 регулировать 州际贸易——联邦政府 регулировать。

既然你知道最高法院在此期间的作为，你也应该了解杰斐逊和民主共和党将如何执政。杰斐逊的政党主张严格解释宪法，限制联邦政府的权力，杰斐逊倾向于国家的农业愿景。为此，杰斐逊及其政党允许《煽动叛乱法》失效，削减了军队规模，并取消了对威士忌等商品的消费税。

杰斐逊所做的一些与他所在政党信仰不符的事情包括，杰斐逊保留了美国银行，并且他利用对宪法的宽松解释进行了路易斯安那购地。杰斐逊将使用联邦党的原则购买路易斯安那领地。杰斐逊在进行路易斯安那购地时放弃了他的宪法原则是有原因的。其中之一是，所有这些土地将使他能够通过为后代提供充足的土地来实现农业社会的目标——因为你知道杰斐逊非常重视这一点。通过从法国获得这片土地，美国可以防止一个潜在的敌对国家就在其家门口。通过购买这片土地，西部的农民将获得密西西比河的通道。

关于这次购买的一些背景：杰斐逊派詹姆斯·门罗前往巴黎，试图从法国购买新奥尔良——只是你在蓝色区域看到的那片领土。很快，拿破仑提出以 1500 万美元的价格出售整个路易斯安那领地。这得益于拿破仑的军队未能镇压海地的奴隶起义。拿破仑需要钱，而法国自 1791 年以来一直在应对海地革命，不幸的是，到 1804 年，海地将独立。拿破仑在欧洲有很多敌人，他需要钱打仗。1803 年，拿破仑宁愿要 1500 万美元，也不愿要北美洲的一堆土地。

路易斯安那购地是一次外交上的成功，使美国对北美洲的影响力和控制力得到加强。1804 年，刘易斯和克拉克率领了一支对刚刚购买的密西西比河以西地区进行科学考察的队伍。

杰斐逊还不得不应对英法之间持续的战争，这导致了对美国中立的侵犯。在联邦党和民主共和党总统的领导下，法国和英国都侵犯了美国的中立。在杰斐逊的第二任期内，汤米发现很难让英国和法国停止袭击美国船只。我喜欢这幅政治漫画中拿破仑的小个子形象。

1807 年，英国军舰豹号袭击美国军舰切萨皮克号，紧张局势急剧升级。这次袭击导致三名美国人死亡，切萨皮克-豹号事件导致许多美国人要求杰斐逊通过宣战来捍卫美国的荣誉。杰斐逊反而呼吁实施 1807 年的禁运法案。该法案禁止所有美国贸易，希望以此防止我们的船只被劫持。可悲的是，禁运是一场灾难。美国商人走私货物并继续与欧洲进行贸易，禁运对美国经济的损害大于对法国或英国的损害。

1808 年，麦迪逊总统轻松赢得选举，并继承了努力维持美国中立的挑战。可悲的是，为维持美国中立而采取的其他许多措施并没有真正达到美国决策者所希望的结果。英国和法国继续扣押美国船只和水手。1810 年，年轻的南方人和西部人在国会当选，被称为“战争鹰派”，他们主张对英国开战。他们认为战争是阻止英国骚扰美国航运和捍卫美国荣誉的最佳方式。他们还认为对英国的战争是消除边境地区美洲印第安人抵抗的一种方式。记住，英国在西北地区向美洲印第安人出售武器，一些“战争鹰派”将与英国的战争视为夺取加拿大的一种方式——国家扩张，宝贝。

麦迪逊将在 1812 年要求国会对英国宣战，于是，女士们先生们，美国的第一场宣战战争——1812 年战争开始了。麦迪逊宣战的原因包括你在这里看到的，但促成这一决定的因素还包括英国继续在美国领土上保留堡垒，特库姆塞和其他美洲印第安人得到英国的支持，以及从英国手中夺取加拿大的呼声。

战争开始时，美国海军规模很小，陆军训练不足，战争初期进展不顺。几个亮点：1814 年 8 月，英军攻入华盛顿，烧毁了美国国会大厦、总统官邸和许多其他建筑物。另一个重要时刻是英国袭击麦克亨利堡——弗朗西斯·斯科特·基写下了《星条旗永不落》。你知道，因为国旗还在那里。

最终，战争将在 1814 年通过《根特条约》结束。两国都没有取得军事上的胜利，但英国有比再次与他们以前的孩子战斗更重要的事情要做。在战争结束的消息传到战场之前，安德鲁·杰克逊领导下的美军赢得了新奥尔良战役。1812 年战争结束后，安德鲁·杰克逊成为战争英雄。我想知道在不久的将来我们是否会再次听到这个人的消息。

最后，在 1812 年战争期间，激进的新英格兰联邦党人在哈特福德会议上会面，并考虑可能脱离联邦。坏主意，伙计。战争结束后，民族主义情绪将高涨——别忘了我们不效忠任何王冠——随着联邦党在哈特福德会议后消亡，这个国家将进入所谓的“美好时代”，届时将只有一个政党——民主共和党。

在我的下一个视频中，我将探讨美国体系和亨利·克莱，并且我将讨论在所谓的“美好时代”期间民主共和党人之间发生的一些分歧。下次再见，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
