What's up, beautiful people? Today we are covering the Seven Years' War in North America -- known as the French and Indian War. Let's get into the background.

In the mid-18th century, colonial rivalry 竞争；对抗 intensified 加剧 between Britain (in the yellow) and France (in the red/purplish color). What are they beefing over? The population of the British colonies expanded into the interior 内陆；腹地 of North America and came into contact with areas claimed by France. Remember, although this area is claimed by France, the population of New France was substantially 大大地；本质上地 smaller than the British 13 colonies.

Since the French had way less people in North America and tended to coexist with 与…… 共存 Native American tribes -- there was the fur trade, some intermarriage 通婚 -- the British colonists' entry into the interior of North America threatened not only French claims to this region but also threatened French-Indian trade networks and American Indian autonomy 自治；自主权.

The French and Indian War would not be the first war between these European powers. Three other wars would also take place. All of these wars demonstrate 证明；显示 that European imperial 帝国的 powers fought one another for dominance 统治；主导权 in North America. Ultimately, the French and Indian War would break out when a Virginian named George Washington was sent with the Virginia militia 民兵组织 to warn the French to stay the heck away from British land claims. Shots were fired, and we got ourselves a war that was started in North America.

The French and Indian War would start in North America over this conflict in the Ohio Valley -- a competition between Britain and France over colonial territory 领土 in North America. In 1756, the war would become a global conflict called the Seven Years' War. Cheers to one of the first world wars.

In terms of who is fighting: on one side you have the French and a lot of important alliances 联盟 with various Indian groups. It makes sense -- the majority of Native American tribes in the region would side with 支持；站在…… 一边 the French. There are far fewer of them, they had established trade networks with the French settlements, and Britain was seen as the far greater threat. On the other side were the British, who also had some alliances with local tribes but nowhere near what France had, and of course her 13 colonies.

Early on, the colonists and their mama country Britain struggled against the French and their Native American allies. The immediate challenge was to figure out how the colonies and mama would defend the colonies against the French. To accomplish this goal, a meeting was held called the Albany Congress in 1754.

At the Albany Congress, the founding father Benjamin Franklin proposed his Albany Plan of Union. This is the context for Mr. Benny Franklin creating the political cartoon "Join or Die." The basic premise 前提；假设 of the plan was for the colonies to cooperate by choosing representatives that would meet to coordinate 协调；协作 colonial defense and western expansion -- or to put simply, "join or die." They also invited members of the Iroquois Confederacy to try to convince them to join team mama England against the French and their Indian allies.

Nothing unfortunately really came of the Albany Plan. Remember, these colonies have no real shared history with one another -- they don't see themselves as having a common goal. However, the Albany Plan would establish a precedent 先例；范例 for the colonies coordinating with one another that would actually come into existence with the Stamp Act Congress, Continental Congress, and other events we will talk about in the near future.

While at first the French were winning the French and Indian War, unfortunately for them that didn't last too long. Eventually the war would end in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris. France was kicked out of North America -- they lost all their colonial territory in North America. A place they will keep in the Western Hemisphere is Haiti, which will be important when we get to the Louisiana Purchase (foreshadowing 预示；伏笔).

With the defeat of the French, Britain got a ton of new territory. All that land they were originally beefing over in the Ohio River Valley was granted to Britain. Also granted was Canada, and they also got Florida from Spain. French lands west of the Mississippi were handed over to Spain.

Now that the land in the Ohio River Valley was free of French control, colonists sought to expand westward into this territory. They figured the Ohio River Valley is open for settlement. There are some challenges for Britain though. England has to maintain control over this large chunk of territory they just won. They suddenly have to deal with the French colonists who are in Canada that they just acquired, and they also have to deal with conflicts between the colonists and American Indians in the frontier 边疆；边境地区.

France's loss in the French and Indian War was not only bad for France but also for various American Indian tribes. They not only lost their main trading partner, but their claims to the land were not at all recognized by the Treaty of Paris. Problems are going to emerge 出现；发生 really quickly.

Pontiac, an Ottawa chief, forged 建立；结成 a western confederation 同盟 and rebelled against 反抗；反叛 colonists encroaching on 侵占；蚕食 Native American land in 1763. Pontiac's Rebellion ultimately led to the death of a bunch of colonists, and of course the colonists are looking at mama: "Help me!" In response, Britain not only had to keep additional troops in North America -- not only to crush 镇压；粉碎 Pontiac's Rebellion but also to govern their vast 广阔的；巨大的 new territorial holdings acquired from the French and Indian War.

To help accomplish this goal, Parliament passed the Proclamation Line of 1763. This act forbid 禁止 colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. The hope was this would prevent conflict between colonists and American Indians on the frontier. And it makes sense -- if colonists can't go west of the Appalachian Mountains into Native American land, the likelihood 可能性 of them being killed by American Indians dramatically goes down, and Britain won't be asked to defend the colonists.

But the Proclamation Act of 1763 was one part of growing colonial resentment 愤恨；不满 towards Britain. Another impact of the French and Indian War was a tremendous 极大的；巨大的 increase in Britain's debt. Not only was the war pricey, but look at all that territory Britain has to protect and govern. War is expensive, and the British saw the war as part of the defense of the colonies. Therefore, in the minds of Britain, the colonies should help pay down the debt and the added cost of administering 管理；治理 a much bigger empire in North America. This is where the taxes are going to come in.

But remember, for most of the time period, the colonies were allowed a great degree of freedom. This was called salutary neglect 有益的忽视（指 18 世纪英国对其殖民地采取的宽松政策）. After 1763, this period of salutary neglect will come to an end as, in response to the new realities, Britain will seek to raise revenue 收入；收益 through taxes and consolidate 巩固；加强 control over the colonies. New taxes and increased regulation was another part of growing colonial resentment towards Britain.

Colonists see things very differently. They felt they fought in the French and Indian War and should be able to reap the rewards of that war. In their minds, the land is ours. So in the end, the French and Indian War had enormous consequences 后果；影响 for the relationship between mama Britain and her 13 kiddos. The biggest effect of the French and Indian War though will be a dramatic change in British colonial policy.

And in our next video, I will examine "taxation without representation." Until next time, thank you so much for watching this Joe's Productions video. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我们来探讨北美洲的七年战争——也被称为法国和印第安人战争。让我们先了解一下背景。

18 世纪中叶，英国（黄色区域）和法国（红色/紫色区域）之间的殖民竞争日益激烈。他们争夺什么？英国殖民地的人口扩张到了北美内陆，并与法国声称拥有的地区接触。记住，虽然该地区是法国声称拥有的，但新法兰西的人口远小于英国的 13 个殖民地。

由于法国在北美的人口远少于英国，并且倾向于与美洲原住民部落共存——有毛皮贸易，一些通婚——英国殖民者进入北美内陆不仅威胁到法国对该地区的主张，也威胁到法印贸易网络和美洲原住民的自治权。

法国和印第安人战争并非这两个欧洲强国之间的第一场战争。此前还发生了另外三场战争。所有这些战争都表明，欧洲帝国主义强国为了争夺在北美的统治地位而相互争斗。最终，当一位名叫乔治·华盛顿的弗吉尼亚人率领弗吉尼亚民兵警告法国人远离英国的土地主张时，法国和印第安人战争爆发了。枪声响起，一场始于北美的战争开始了。

法国和印第安人战争始于北美，起因是俄亥俄河谷的冲突——英国和法国争夺北美殖民地领土的竞争。1756 年，这场战争演变成一场全球性冲突，即七年战争。为最早的世界大战之一干杯。

就参战方而言：一方是法国和许多与各个印第安部落的重要联盟。这是有道理的——该地区的大多数美洲原住民部落都会站在法国一边。他们的人数要少得多，他们与法国殖民地建立了贸易网络，而英国被视为更大的威胁。另一方是英国，他们也与当地一些部落结盟，但远不如法国拥有的多，当然还有她的 13 个殖民地。

早期，殖民者和他们的宗主国英国与法国及其美洲原住民盟友作战非常艰难。当时的直接挑战是如何让殖民地和宗主国共同防御法国对殖民地的进攻。为了实现这一目标，1754 年召开了一次会议，称为奥尔巴尼会议。

在奥尔巴尼会议上，国父本杰明·富兰克林提出了他的奥尔巴尼联邦方案。这就是本尼·富兰克林先生创作政治漫画“不联合，就灭亡”的背景。该方案的基本前提是殖民地通过选举代表进行合作，这些代表将开会协调殖民地的防御和西扩——简单地说就是“不联合，就灭亡”。他们还邀请了易洛魁联盟的成员，试图说服他们加入英国阵营，对抗法国及其印第安盟友。

不幸的是，奥尔巴尼方案并没有真正取得任何成果。记住，这些殖民地彼此之间没有真正的共同历史——它们不认为自己有共同的目标。然而，奥尔巴尼方案将为殖民地之间的协调树立先例，而这种协调实际上将在印花税法会议、大陆会议以及我们将在不久的将来讨论的其他事件中实现。

虽然最初法国在法国和印第安人战争中获胜，但不幸的是，这种情况并没有持续太久。最终，战争于 1763 年以《巴黎条约》结束。法国被逐出北美——他们失去了在北美的所有殖民地领土。他们将在西半球保留一个地方是海地，当我们讨论路易斯安那购地案时，这将非常重要（伏笔）。

随着法国的战败，英国获得了大量新领土。他们最初在俄亥俄河谷争夺的所有土地都割让给了英国。加拿大也被割让给了英国，他们还从西班牙手中获得了佛罗里达。密西西比河以西的法国土地则割让给了西班牙。

现在俄亥俄河谷的土地摆脱了法国的控制，殖民者试图向西扩张到这片领土。他们认为俄亥俄河谷可以进行殖民。但英国面临一些挑战。英国必须维持对他们刚刚赢得的这片广阔领土的控制。他们突然要处理他们刚刚获得的加拿大境内的法国殖民者，而且还要处理边境地区殖民者和美洲印第安人之间的冲突。

法国在法国和印第安人战争中的失败不仅对法国不利，对各个美洲印第安部落也不利。他们不仅失去了主要的贸易伙伴，而且他们对土地的主张根本没有得到《巴黎条约》的承认。问题将很快出现。

渥太华酋长庞蒂亚克于 1763 年建立了一个西部联盟，并反抗侵占美洲原住民土地的殖民者。庞蒂亚克叛乱最终导致大量殖民者死亡，当然殖民者向宗主国求助：“救命！”作为回应，英国不仅不得不向北美增派军队——不仅是为了镇压庞蒂亚克叛乱，也是为了统治他们从法国和印第安人战争中获得的大片新领土。

为了帮助实现这一目标，议会通过了 1763 年的公告法令。该法令禁止殖民者在阿巴拉契亚山脉以西定居。希望这能防止边境地区殖民者和美洲印第安人之间的冲突。这是有道理的——如果殖民者不能越过阿巴拉契亚山脉进入美洲原住民的土地，他们被美洲印第安人杀害的可能性就会大大降低，英国也不会被要求保护殖民者。

但 1763 年的公告法令是殖民地对英国日益增长的不满的一部分。法国和印第安人战争的另一个影响是英国的债务急剧增加。战争不仅代价高昂，而且看看英国必须保护和统治的这片广阔的领土。战争是昂贵的，英国人认为这场战争是殖民地防御的一部分。因此，在英国看来，殖民地应该帮助偿还债务以及管理在北美洲更大帝国的额外成本。这就是税收的来源。

但记住，在大部分时间里，殖民地被允许享有很大的自由。这被称为“有益的忽视”。1763 年之后，随着英国为了应对新的现实，寻求通过税收增加收入并巩固对殖民地的控制，这个“有益的忽视”时期将结束。新的税收和加强的监管是殖民地对英国日益增长的不满的另一个原因。

殖民者对此看法截然不同。他们认为他们参加了法国和印第安人战争，应该能够获得战争的报酬。在他们看来，这片土地是我们的。所以最终，法国和印第安人战争对英国宗主国和她的 13 个孩子之间的关系产生了巨大的影响。然而，法国和印第安人战争最大的影响将是英国殖民政策的巨大变化。

在我们的下一个视频中，我将探讨“无代表，不纳税”。下次再见，非常感谢您观看乔氏制作的视频。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
