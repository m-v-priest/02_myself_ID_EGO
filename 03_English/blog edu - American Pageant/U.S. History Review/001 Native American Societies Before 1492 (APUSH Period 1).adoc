What's up, beautiful people? Today I'm going to explain stuff you should definitely know about Native American societies before the white people came.

To start, there are two things most peeps get wrong about American history. First, just because you are learning about US history in school, it does not mean you need to have the word "American" in the title. Come on, textbook companies! The second thing is: the first people to colonize 殖民；开拓殖民地 the Americas were not the pilgrims, Disney hunks, or even Columbus, but rather the first people to colonize the Americas came from Asia.

Way back in the day — anywhere between 36,000 and 14,000 years ago — people began migrating 迁徙；迁移 from Asia to the Americas. They did this by crossing the Bering Strait land bridge that was formed between Asia and North America during an ice age. Now, this migration 迁徙；迁移 did not happen all at once but over thousands of years. Native populations migrated and settled across the vast expanse 广阔区域 of the Americas.

Side note: It's not until you've done a road trip across America that you truly appreciate how big this country is.

As the migration and settlement took place, native people developed distinct 独特的；明显不同的 and increasingly complex societies. They spoke different languages and developed many different cultures. They developed the distinct and increasingly complex societies that you see on the map by adapting to and transforming their diverse environments. We got it all in the Western Hemisphere 西半球: too much rain, too little rain, plenty of fertile 肥沃的 soil, spots where the soil is frozen most of the year — you name it, we got it.

What is important to note — in spite of the simplistic 简单化的 (might I dare say racist 种族主义的) ways Native Americans have been depicted 描绘；描述 in popular culture and by various sports teams — is that both prior to and after European contact, there were different and complex Native American societies throughout the Western Hemisphere.

Now, we use the term "pre-Columbian" 哥伦布发现美洲大陆前的 to refer to societies in the Americas before the arrival of Columbus. But please note: the arrival of Columbus and other European settlers does not mean all these pre-Columbian societies are suddenly gone from the Americas. Native people and culture are still very much a part of the American story, and we will be seeing this story play out throughout many of these videos.

Now that you know of the presence of different and complex societies before European contact, one of the most remarkable 非凡的；显著的 things about this diversity is the innovations 创新；革新 in agriculture and the ripple effect 连锁反应 it had on native societies throughout the continent.

The spread of maize 玉米 cultivation 种植；栽培 from modern-day Mexico (or corn) north into what is now the American Southwest and elsewhere allowed nomadic 游牧的 hunting-gathering societies to transition 转变；过渡 to settled agricultural societies. It supported economic development and helped social diversification 多样化 among societies. I mean, of course maize cultivation spreads northwards — why rely on wandering around looking for food when you can grub on this deliciousness?

Maize became the main food source for many of the tribes 部落 in the Southwest. Now, if you've ever been to the American Southwest, you know it is hot as hell. So the native people needed to develop a way to irrigate 灌溉 the exceptionally 极其；非常 dry land. In what is now present-day New Mexico and Arizona, the Pueblo people and others crafted adobe 土坯结构的 structures and developed complex irrigation methods to grow maize and also other crops such as squash 南瓜 and beans.

Adapting to the environment was a reality on the Great Plains as well. As a result of a lack of natural resources and fertile soil, the Sioux and other tribes of the Great Plains relied on a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Part of the reason they were hunters and gatherers was because of the importance of hunting bison 野牛. You had to be mobile 流动的；移动的 to hunt these bad boys — they're not just sitting there waiting for you at Whole Foods.

Tribes on the East Coast, especially along the Atlantic seaboard 沿海地区, will be the tribes that the English and the French colonists will first encounter 遭遇；遇到. And the eastern part of North America will have a lot of different tribes, and many of these societies developed mixed agricultural and hunter-gatherer economies 经济体系 that favored the development of permanent 永久的 villages. Basically, many of these tribes developed a mixed way of life with farming for part of the year (when it's not super cold) as well as hunting, gathering, and even fur trapping 诱捕.

Tribes such as the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and Huron formed political alliances 联盟 and trade networks with neighboring Native American tribes and later on would be bitter rivals 竞争对手 with one another. Remember: Indigenous 土著的；本土的 people were not a monolithic 单一的；无差别的 group. They spoke different languages and occasionally caught beef with one another. Keep the Huron and the Iroquois in mind, especially when the showdown 摊牌；决战 happens in 1754 between the French and the British in the Ohio River Valley.

Foreshadowing 伏笔！Up in the Pacific Northwest, fishing and furry animals in the forest provided native people plenty of food, not to mention the vast resources of the ocean. And finally, farming in the Mississippi River Valley allowed for large settlements 定居点 of thousands of people to form. In this image by an artist, you can see the homes and mounds 土丘 of the Cahokia people around the year 1150. At this time, the population is estimated 估计；估算 to have been around 20,000 people living in these settlements — and that is more than what lived in London at that same time.

In short, history of the Americas began way before 1492. Historians estimate about 50 million people were already in the Western Hemisphere upon Columbus's arrival, and about 5 million native people are living in what is now North America.

In our next video, I will talk about European exploration 探索 in the Americas. But until then, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我将解释一些在白人到来之前，你们绝对应该了解的美洲原住民社会。

首先，大多数人对美国历史有两个常见的误解。第一，仅仅因为你在学校学习美国历史，并不意味着你需要在标题中使用“美国”这个词。拜托了，教科书公司！第二件事是：第一个殖民美洲的人不是朝圣者、迪士尼帅哥，甚至不是哥伦布，而是第一个殖民美洲的人来自亚洲。

很久很久以前——大约在 36000 年到 14000 年前——人们开始从亚洲迁徙到美洲。他们通过白令海峡陆桥完成这一过程，这座陆桥在冰河时期形成于亚洲和北美洲之间。现在，这次迁徙并非一次性完成，而是持续了数千年。美洲原住民迁徙并在美洲广阔的土地上定居。

题外话：只有当你进行一次横跨美国的公路旅行后，你才能真正体会到这个国家有多么巨大。

随着迁徙和定居的发生，当地居民发展出独特且日益复杂的社会。他们说着不同的语言，发展出许多不同的文化。他们通过适应和改造其多样化的环境，发展出你在地图上看到的独特且日益复杂的社会。我们在西半球应有尽有：过多的雨水、过少的雨水、充足的肥沃土壤、一年中大部分时间土壤都冻结的地方——你能想到的，我们都有。

重要的是要注意——尽管大众文化和各种体育团队以过于简单化（我甚至敢说是种族主义的）方式描绘美洲原住民——但在欧洲人到来之前和之后，整个西半球都存在着不同且复杂的美洲原住民社会。

现在，我们使用“前哥伦布时期”这个术语来指代哥伦布到达美洲之前的社会。但请注意：哥伦布和其他欧洲殖民者的到来并不意味着所有这些前哥伦布时期的社会都突然从美洲消失了。美洲原住民及其文化仍然是美国故事的重要组成部分，我们将在许多视频中看到这个故事的展开。

既然你们已经了解了欧洲人到来之前存在着不同且复杂的社会，那么这种多样性最显著的方面之一就是农业创新及其对整个大陆美洲原住民社会产生的连锁反应。

玉米种植从现代墨西哥（或玉米）向北传播到现在的美国西南部和其他地区，使得游牧的狩猎采集社会能够过渡到定居的农业社会。它促进了经济发展，并有助于社会内部的社会分化。我的意思是，玉米种植当然会向北传播——当你可以享用这种美味时，为什么还要依赖四处寻找食物呢？

玉米成为西南部许多部落的主要食物来源。现在，如果你去过美国西南部，你就知道那里热得像地狱一样。因此，当地居民需要开发一种灌溉异常干燥土地的方法。在现在的美国新墨西哥州和亚利桑那州，普韦布罗人和其他民族建造了土坯建筑，并开发了复杂的灌溉方法来种植玉米以及其他作物，如南瓜和豆类。

适应环境也是大平原上的现实。由于缺乏自然资源和肥沃的土壤，苏族和其他大平原部落依赖于游牧的狩猎采集生活方式。他们成为狩猎采集者部分原因是狩猎野牛的重要性。你必须保持流动才能猎杀这些厉害的家伙——它们不会只是坐在全食超市等着你。

东海岸的部落，特别是沿大西洋沿岸的部落，将是英国和法国殖民者最先遇到的部落。北美洲东部将有许多不同的部落，其中许多社会发展了混合的农业和狩猎采集经济，这有利于永久村庄的发展。基本上，这些部落中的许多发展了一种混合的生活方式，一年中的部分时间（当不是很冷的时候）进行农业耕作，同时也进行狩猎、采集甚至毛皮捕猎。

像霍德诺索尼（易洛魁）和休伦这样的部落与邻近的美洲原住民部落形成了政治联盟和贸易网络，后来彼此之间将成为激烈的竞争对手。记住：土著人民不是一个单一的群体。他们说着不同的语言，偶尔也会发生冲突。记住休伦人和易洛魁人，尤其是在 1754 年法国和英国在俄亥俄河谷发生冲突时。

伏笔！在太平洋西北地区，渔业和森林中的毛皮动物为当地居民提供了充足的食物，更不用说广阔海洋的丰富资源了。最后，密西西比河谷的农业使得数千人的大型定居点得以形成。在这张艺术家创作的图片中，你可以看到大约公元 1150 年卡霍基亚人的房屋和土墩。当时，估计有大约 20000 人居住在这些定居点中——这比同一时期居住在伦敦的人口还要多。

简而言之，美洲的历史远早于 1492 年就开始了。历史学家估计，在哥伦布到达时，西半球已经有大约 5000 万人，而现在北美洲居住着大约 500 万美洲原住民。

在我们的下一个视频中，我将讨论欧洲在美洲的探险。但在那之前，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
