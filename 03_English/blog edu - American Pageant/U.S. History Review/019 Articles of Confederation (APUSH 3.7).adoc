What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Jost Productions. Today we're taking a look at the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例.

One of the most significant developments of the revolutionary period was the formation of a new government based upon the principles fought for during the American Revolution. You might recall, in order to limit the power of the government, many new state constitutions 宪法 placed power into the hands of the legislative branch 立法机构. Remember, the colonists had just got out of what was in their mind an abusive, tyrannical 专制的；暴虐的 relationship. So when they go creating new state governments, they deliberately drafted 起草 state constitutions with very limited power.

Many of the new state governments included state Bill of Rights 权利法案 -- seven of the thirteen did. Most state governments minimized or eliminated the role of the executive branch 行政机构. Not a lot of power delegated 授予 to the governors of states. And most political power will be held in the legislative branch of the states. The legislative branch was often viewed as the most important branch of government. This is where laws would be made, and the idea behind this was the legislative branch was filled with representatives of the people of that state. Power held in the legislative branch would mean the government would be held accountable 负有责任的 by the people -- or at least the white male property owners that could vote in each state.

The Articles of Confederation is the first attempt at a national government, and it is under the Articles that members of the Second Continental Congress sought to unify the newly independent states. The former colonists created a central government with limited power. Some examples of limits to government power under the Articles include: the Articles created a one-branch government. There was not an executive branch under the Articles. Just in case you are wondering, today we have three branches of government. The Articles had one. There was not an executive branch under the Articles. They were very worried about creating a position that would exercise power 行使权力 like a king would. Also, there was no national court system. Each state had one vote in the unicameral 一院制的 or one-house legislative branch. And changes or amendments 修正案 to the Articles required unanimous consent 一致同意 of all 13 states. That's going to be super hard to get. And to pass a law, it required 9 out of 13 states to agree. That is what is called a super majority 绝对多数，and guess what? That is also super hard to achieve.

Under the Articles, individual states were sovereign 主权的. So each state retained its sovereignty, freedom and independence. Problems begin to emerge when, following the American Revolution, difficulties over international trade, finances, interstate commerce 州际贸易，foreign relations and internal unrest led to calls for a stronger central government. That's a lot of problems.

In the 1780s, the economy of the US was a hot mess. The new country was in debt with no real way to raise revenue 收入. You might be wondering, what if we taxed? Well, under the Articles, the national government had zero authority to tax directly. States had the ability to tax, but not the federal government. In addition, Congress could not regulate 管理 interstate trade or commerce. Individual states could impose tariffs 关税 on other states. And states printed their own money. Many states were printing money after the American Revolution in an attempt to pay down their post-revolutionary debt, which basically led to a whole bunch of inflation 通货膨胀.

The new nation faced many threats from foreign countries as well. Britain still occupied forts in the Northwest Territory 西北地区 and traded weapons with Native Americans that were then used against Americans in the frontier 边疆. And since the Articles of Confederation can't raise money to deal with this violation of the Treaty of Paris, there was no national army to really deal with this issue. Spain stopped allowing the US to use the port of New Orleans and closed the Mississippi River to US trade in 1784. And people in the frontier -- like in places like Tennessee and Kentucky -- really relied on access to the Mississippi, and it was shut down.

Now we can't leave this video being a Debbie Downer 煞风景的人 about the Articles of Confederation. Don't tell my wife or any Debbies you know that I'm using the name Debbie in this way. But there were some positive things under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles did get the colonists through the American Revolution. That transition from colonists to citizens of the United States occurred under the Articles of Confederation.

Now that England was no longer in charge, the Proclamation of 1763 was no longer keeping settlers from moving westward. During the 1780s, as individuals headed west, Congress under the Articles of Confederation had to figure out how they were going to govern this new territory and how new territory may enter the union as a new state. The Northwest Ordinances 西北法令 was passed by Congress under the Articles of Confederation to deal with these exact issues, and basically it provided for the organized settlement of territory in the west and outlined the process for statehood.

When I talk about the Northwest Ordinances, please note there are a bunch of different laws passed, but the importance of it can be summed up as follows. One thing done under the Northwest Ordinances was the admission process for new states was established. Once a territory reached a certain number of settlers, the area would be eligible for statehood. The state would enter the union as an equal state to the original 13. The Northwest Ordinance not only promoted public education 教育 and protected private property, but also banned 禁止 slavery in the Northwest Territory. These states would eventually be the free states you see on the map. But while this is happening, new slave states would enter the union in the south. This admission of free and slave states would eventually increase tensions between the north and south, but that will save that for another time -- foreshadowing 预示.

And often overlooked when looking at the Northwest Ordinance is the fact that American settlement in this region increased tensions with Native American tribes.

Finally, we need to take another turn to Negative Town. Shays' Rebellion 谢斯起义. Some background: many farmers were in debt in the 1780s. Many of these farmers had fought the American Revolution, and it was very difficult to pay back the debt after the revolution, and many of those in debt ended up in prison. Although the federal government could not tax, states passed their own taxes. And with all this money being printed, inflation became a big problem.

Daniel Shays, a veteran of the American Revolution and fellow farmer in debt, began a movement to attempt to stop the foreclosure 止赎 of farms, to lighten the taxes, and to provide relief to the farmers of western Massachusetts. Unfortunately for Daniel and the farmers, their demands and petitions 请愿 were ignored by the state legislature in Boston. So a group of angry farmers organized a march to the armory to get some guns to try to get the government of Massachusetts to listen to their demands. These demands were ignored, and as a result, Shays' Rebellion was a revolt by backcountry farmers -- around 4,000 of them -- against taxes imposed by a distant government in Boston.

This situation scared the elite 精英. You got angry American Revolution veterans, farmers making demands with guns. For some, this seemed like mob rule 暴民统治 or something like Stamp Act 2.0, but this time the bad guys are the Americans. Or to sum up...

So why is this important? As mentioned, Shays' Rebellion created a fear amongst the property classes. There was no way the Articles could respond -- they can't fund the military. And Shays' Rebellion was actually put down by a state and privately funded militia 民兵组织. Shays' Rebellion led to increased calls for a stronger federal government. And for many, the rebellion demonstrated the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. It seemed like the Articles were not capable of governing, and some began to ask maybe we need a new government.

The Articles of Confederation -- the first national government of the US -- will eventually be replaced by the Constitution. And that's what we're gonna cover in our next video: the Constitutional Convention. Until next time, thank you so much for watching this Joe's Productions video. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们来探讨邦联条例。

革命时期最重要的发展之一是建立了一个基于美国革命期间为之奋斗的原则的新政府。你可能还记得，为了限制政府的权力，许多新的州宪法将权力置于立法部门手中。记住，殖民者刚刚摆脱了他们认为是一种虐待性的、暴君式的关系。因此，当他们建立新的州政府时，他们故意起草了权力非常有限的州宪法。

许多新的州政府都包含了州权利法案——13 个州中有 7 个是这样做的。大多数州政府都尽量减少或取消了行政部门的作用。州长的权力不大。大部分政治权力将掌握在各州的立法部门手中。立法部门通常被认为是政府最重要的部门。法律将在这里制定，其背后的想法是立法部门由该州人民的代表组成。立法部门掌握权力意味着政府将对人民负责——或者至少是对每个州可以投票的白人男性财产所有者负责。

邦联条例是首次尝试建立国家政府，正是在邦联条例下，第二次大陆会议的成员试图统一新独立的各州。前殖民者建立了一个权力有限的中央政府。邦联条例下政府权力的一些限制包括：邦联条例建立了一个一院制政府。邦联条例下没有行政部门。以防你好奇，今天我们有三个政府部门。邦联条例只有一个。邦联条例下没有行政部门。他们非常担心建立一个像国王一样行使权力的职位。此外，没有国家法院系统。在单一或一院制的立法部门中，每个州都有一票。对邦联条例的更改或修正需要所有 13 个州的一致同意。这将会非常难以实现。而要通过一项法律，需要 13 个州中的 9 个州同意。这被称为超级多数，你猜怎么着？这也非常难以实现。

根据邦联条例，各州是主权国家。因此，每个州都保留其主权、自由和独立。在美国革命之后，国际贸易、财政、州际商业、外交关系和国内动荡等方面的困难导致人们呼吁建立一个更强大的中央政府，问题开始浮现。这有很多问题。

在 1780 年代，美国的经济一团糟。这个新成立的国家负债累累，没有真正增加收入的方法。你可能想知道，如果我们征税呢？好吧，根据邦联条例，国家政府没有任何直接征税的权力。各州有征税的能力，但联邦政府没有。此外，国会不能 регулировать 州际贸易或商业。各州可以对其他州征收关税。各州发行自己的货币。美国革命后，许多州为了偿还革命后的债务而印钞，这基本上导致了严重的通货膨胀。

这个新成立的国家也面临着来自外国的许多威胁。英国仍然占领着西北地区的堡垒，并与当地的美洲原住民进行武器贸易，这些武器随后被用来对付边境地区的美国人。由于邦联条例无法筹集资金来处理这种违反《巴黎条约》的行为，因此没有真正的国家军队来处理这个问题。1784 年，西班牙停止允许美国使用新奥尔良港，并关闭了密西西比河的美国贸易通道。边境地区的人们——比如田纳西州和肯塔基州等地——非常依赖密西西比河的通道，但它被关闭了。

现在我们不能让这个视频变成对邦联条例的负面评价。不要告诉我妻子或任何你认识的黛比，我以这种方式使用“黛比”这个名字。但在邦联条例下也有一些积极的事情。邦联条例确实带领殖民者度过了美国革命。从殖民者到美国公民的转变发生在邦联条例下。

既然英国不再负责，1763 年的公告不再阻止定居者向西迁移。在 1780 年代，随着个人向西迁移，邦联条例下的国会必须弄清楚他们将如何管理这片新领土，以及新领土如何作为新州加入联邦。邦联条例下的国会通过了西北法令来解决这些具体问题，基本上，它规定了西部领土的有序定居，并概述了建州的过程。

当我谈到西北法令时，请注意通过了许多不同的法律，但其重要性可以概括如下。西北法令下完成的一件事是建立了新州的加入程序。一旦一个地区达到一定数量的定居者，该地区就有资格建州。该州将作为与最初 13 个州平等的州加入联邦。西北法令不仅促进了公共教育和保护了私有财产，还在西北地区禁止了奴隶制。这些州最终将是你地图上看到的自由州。但与此同时，新的蓄奴州将在南方加入联邦。自由州和蓄奴州的加入最终将加剧南北之间的紧张关系，但这将在以后的视频中讨论——伏笔。

在考察西北法令时，经常被忽视的是，美国在该地区的定居增加了与美洲原住民部落的紧张关系。

最后，我们需要再次转向“消极镇”。谢司叛乱。一些背景：在 1780 年代，许多农民负债累累。这些农民中的许多人参加了美国革命，革命后很难偿还债务，许多负债累累的人最终进了监狱。虽然联邦政府不能征税，但各州通过了自己的税收。随着大量货币的印刷，通货膨胀成为一个大问题。

丹尼尔·谢司是美国革命的老兵，也是一位负债累累的农民，他发起了一场运动，试图阻止农场的止赎、减轻税收并为马萨诸塞州西部的农民提供救济。不幸的是，丹尼尔和农民们的要求和请愿被波士顿的州议会忽视了。因此，一群愤怒的农民组织了一次前往军械库的游行，以获取一些枪支，试图让马萨诸塞州政府听取他们的要求。这些要求被忽视了，结果，谢司叛乱是大约 4000 名后乡农民反抗波士顿遥远政府征收的税收的叛乱。

这种情况吓坏了精英阶层。你有一群愤怒的美国革命老兵，农民们拿着枪提出要求。对一些人来说，这看起来像是暴民统治，或者像是印花税法 2.0，但这次的坏人是美国人。或者总结一下……

那么这为什么重要呢？如前所述，谢司叛乱在有产阶级中制造了恐惧。邦联条例根本无法应对——他们无法资助军队。谢司叛乱实际上是由一个州和私人资助的民兵镇压的。谢司叛乱导致人们更加呼吁建立一个更强大的联邦政府。对许多人来说，这次叛乱暴露了邦联条例的弱点。似乎邦联条例无法进行有效治理，一些人开始质疑我们是否需要一个新的政府。

美国的第一个国家政府——邦联条例——最终将被宪法取代。这就是我们将在下一个视频中讨论的内容：制宪会议。下次再见，非常感谢您观看乔氏制作的视频。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
