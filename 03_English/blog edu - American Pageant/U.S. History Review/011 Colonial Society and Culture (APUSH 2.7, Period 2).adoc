What's up, beautiful people? Today we're covering colonial society and culture. And first thing you need to know is by 1700, the population of North America was increasing pretty rapidly. This happened as a result of babies being born in the colonies — so a natural increase in population. The starving times were over, the colonists are actually living a lot longer, and of course there was immigration 移民 to the colonies from not only Britain but also Scots-Irish, German and other European groups entering the colonies. You also have the forced migration 迁移 of African people contributing to this population increase.

The fact that there were a wide variety of European religious and ethnic 种族的 groups contributed to a significant degree of pluralism 多元主义 in the 13 colonies. All this means is there are a whole bunch of different groups living in this diverse society. Events such as the Great Awakening created a shared experience for many colonists and further led to an acceptance of religious freedom that will very much be a part of American life.

And before we go any further, can we take a quick moment to appreciate this dude seemingly with the giant beer toasting the preacher? The Great Awakening was a religious revival 复兴 that occurred in both Britain and in North America. And during the Great Awakening, traveling preachers brought religion directly to the people. Preachers such as Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield introduced a new emotional style of preaching and stressed 强调 the importance of the individual and their relationship to God. Whitefield brought his Protestant evangelical 福音派的 form of preaching from Britain to the colonies during the First Great Awakening.

This movement will have a number of impacts on the colonies. For instance, prior to the Great Awakening, the dominant 占主导地位的 religions in the colonies will be the Anglican or Church of England and the Congregationalists — those are the Puritans that are up largely in the New England region. But as a result of this religious revival, new Christian groups emerged. New religious groups such as the Methodist, Baptist and others would add to the diversity of colonial life. And the impact of this would mean no one religion would dominate colonial life.

Since the Great Awakening was very much about an individual's relationship with God, the movement was also anti-elitist 反精英主义的 and anti-hierarchical 反等级制度的. And as a result, the Great Awakening would inspire some colonists to question not only the authority of the church but also the authority of the British towards the colonies. But don't get it twisted — this doesn't mean the colonists are calling for independence right away.

Whereas the Great Awakening was very much a religious revival in which individuals understood the world through their faith, the Enlightenment — another movement sweeping through the colonies — emphasized 强调 a belief in reason 理性 as a means to understand the world. The spread of European Enlightenment ideas will contribute to some colonists questioning their relationship with Britain eventually. And some notable Enlightenment thinkers include John Locke who wrote about natural rights (life, liberty and property), Montesquieu famous for his ideas about separation of powers, and Rousseau — the best looking of the bunch — who talked about the social contract 社会契约 and the role of government.

So even though the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment were very different in many ways, both movements were founded upon ideas that originated in Europe and moved to North America. And both movements weakened allegiance 忠诚 or resulted in challenges to traditional authority — whether it be the head of the church or the British monarchy 君主制 or parliament.

Now this is very important: by the mid-1760s, some colonists will question whether their interests and goals were compatible with their mother country in such areas as territorial settlements, defense of the western frontier, trade and self-rule. So what does this mean? Remember Britain promoted mercantile 商业的 policies. The idea behind a mercantile system was to maintain a favorable balance of trade 贸易顺差 — you want to export more goods than you import and increase the nation's share of gold and silver. Another component 组成部分 has to do with why you have colonies. The colonies exist largely to provide the mother country — for instance Britain — with raw materials.

And for most of the time period prior to 1763, the 13 colonies enjoyed a period known as salutary neglect 有益的忽视（指18世纪英国对其殖民地采取的宽松政策）. This will begin to change after 1763. Check out North America prior to the Seven Years' War and check it out after the war in 1763. After the war, British taxation policies influenced revolutionary ideals, which leads us to causes of colonial resistance 抵抗；反对 to British control.

It wasn't just taxes that would cause this resistance. You also had colonial resistance to imperial 帝国的 control from Britain drawing on local experiences of self-government. Colonists in some areas had experience with representative government — whether it be the town hall meetings in the New England region or the Virginia House of Burgesses. In spite of this experience in self-government, colonists could not vote in Parliament or even vote on who represented them in Parliament. Some colonists would take issue with this reality.

Another cause of growing colonial resistance to imperial control was a result of the evolving ideas of liberty, oftentimes influenced by the political thoughts of the Enlightenment. These Enlightenment thinkers' ideas are being shared in the colonies, and this Age of Reason brought new ways of thinking about the world — an idea specifically about government and the rights of people — that heavily influenced many colonists' thoughts about their relationship with Britain.

Amongst the criticism developing in the colonies toward Britain was the perceived corruption 腐败 in the imperial system. Many felt like mercantile laws hindered 阻碍 the economic development of the colonies and kept them dependent on Britain. Whether it be the Great Awakening — George Whitefield came from Britain and traveled to the colonies — or the Enlightenment, this intellectual 智力的；知识的 exchange of ideas across the Atlantic Ocean will have a profound 深刻的 impact on life in the colonies.

We've seen how the colonies are part of the transatlantic economy as goods are leaving and entering North America. But the printing press and the emergence 出现 of movements such as the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment meant the British colonies were also part of a transatlantic print culture that facilitated 促进 the spread of European ideas. Printed pamphlets 小册子, books and other items are contributing to the transmission 传播 of not only Enlightenment ideas but also new ways of looking at religion that came about as a result of the Great Awakening.

As a variety of people and ideas crossed the Atlantic, a colonial society and culture developed. And in spite of the pluralism of life in the colonies, over time there was also gradual Anglicization 英国化 that took place. All this means is individual colonies develop political communities and institutions based on English models. British customs and norms 准则 are adopted. Procedure for government based upon British models is the norm. And these models were influenced by inter-colonial trade, the emergence of a transatlantic print culture, and the spread of Protestant evangelicalism 福音派基督教.

A consequence 结果；后果 of all this is in the British North American colonies, an Anglo-Saxon society and culture emerged. However, although the colonies will be quite heavily influenced by Britain, they are also developing at the same time a significant degree of pluralism in the 13 colonies and developing into their own diverse societies.

And in our next video, we're gonna take a look at the impact of the French and Indian War — and this one's gonna be a game changer. Until then, thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我们来探讨殖民地的社会和文化。首先你需要知道的是，到 1700 年，北美的人口增长非常迅速。这是由于殖民地婴儿的出生——即人口的自然增长。饥荒时期已经过去，殖民者的寿命实际上更长了，当然还有来自英国、苏格兰-爱尔兰、德国和其他欧洲群体的移民涌入殖民地。非洲人民的强迫迁徙也促成了这种人口增长。

各种欧洲宗教和民族群体的存在，极大地促进了 13 个殖民地的多元化。这仅仅意味着在这个多元化的社会中生活着各种各样的不同群体。像大觉醒运动这样的事件为许多殖民者创造了共同的经历，并进一步导致了对宗教自由的接受，而宗教自由将在很大程度上成为美国生活的一部分。

在我们继续之前，我们能不能花一点时间欣赏一下这位似乎拿着巨型啤酒向传教士祝酒的家伙？大觉醒运动是一场发生在英国和北美洲的宗教复兴运动。在大觉醒运动期间，巡回传教士直接将宗教带给人民。乔纳森·爱德华兹和乔治·怀特菲尔德等传教士引入了一种新的情感化的布道方式，并强调个人及其与上帝关系的重要性。怀特菲尔德在第一次大觉醒期间将他的新教福音派布道形式从英国带到了殖民地。

这场运动将对殖民地产生许多影响。例如，在大觉醒运动之前，殖民地的主要宗教将是英国国教或英格兰教会以及公理会教徒——他们主要是新英格兰地区的清教徒。但由于这场宗教复兴，新的基督教团体涌现出来。卫理公会、浸礼会和其他新的宗教团体将增加殖民地生活的多样性。其影响将意味着没有任何一种宗教会主导殖民地生活。

由于大觉醒运动在很大程度上是关于个人与上帝的关系，因此这场运动也是反精英主义和反等级制度的。结果，大觉醒运动将激励一些殖民者不仅质疑教会的权威，而且质疑英国对殖民地的权威。但不要误解——这并不意味着殖民者会立即呼吁独立。

大觉醒运动是一场宗教复兴运动，个人通过他们的信仰来理解世界，而启蒙运动——另一场席卷殖民地的运动——则强调对理性的信仰，将其作为理解世界的一种手段。欧洲启蒙思想的传播最终将促使一些殖民者质疑他们与英国的关系。一些著名的启蒙思想家包括约翰·洛克，他撰写了关于自然权利（生命、自由和财产）的文章；孟德斯鸠，以其关于三权分立的思想而闻名；以及卢梭——其中最英俊的一位——他谈到了社会契约和政府的作用。

因此，尽管大觉醒运动和启蒙运动在许多方面截然不同，但这两场运动都建立在起源于欧洲并传播到北美洲的思想之上。这两场运动都削弱了对传统权威的忠诚或导致了对传统权威的挑战——无论是教会的首脑、英国君主还是议会。

现在这一点非常重要：到 1760 年代中期，一些殖民者将质疑他们在领土 settlement、西部边疆的防御、贸易和自治等领域的利益和目标是否与他们的宗主国相符。这是什么意思？记住，英国推行重商主义政策。重商主义体系背后的思想是维持有利的贸易平衡——你希望出口的商品多于进口的商品，并增加国家的黄金和白银份额。另一个组成部分与你为什么拥有殖民地有关。殖民地的存在主要是为了向宗主国——例如英国——提供原材料。

在 1763 年之前的大部分时间里，13 个殖民地都享有一个被称为“有益的忽视”的时期。这种情况将在 1763 年之后开始改变。看看七年战争之前的北美洲，再看看 1763 年战争之后的北美洲。战争之后，英国的税收政策影响了革命理想，这导致了殖民地对英国统治的反抗。

不仅仅是税收导致了这种反抗。殖民地对英国的帝国控制的反抗也借鉴了当地自治的经验。一些地区的殖民者拥有代议制政府的经验——无论是新英格兰地区的镇议会会议还是弗吉尼亚的众议院。尽管拥有这种自治经验，殖民者却不能在议会中投票，甚至不能投票选举他们在议会的代表。一些殖民者会对这种现实提出异议。

殖民地对帝国控制日益增长的反抗的另一个原因是自由观念的演变，这种观念通常受到启蒙运动政治思想的影响。这些启蒙思想家的思想在殖民地传播，这个理性时代带来了思考世界的新方式——一种特别是关于政府和人民权利的思想——这深刻地影响了许多殖民者关于他们与英国关系的看法。

在殖民地对英国日益增长的批评中，存在着对帝国体系中腐败的认知。许多人认为重商主义法律阻碍了殖民地的经济发展，并使它们依赖于英国。无论是大觉醒运动——乔治·怀特菲尔德来自英国并前往殖民地——还是启蒙运动，这种跨越大西洋的思想的知识交流都将对殖民地的生活产生深远的影响。

我们已经看到，随着商品进出北美洲，殖民地是跨大西洋经济的一部分。但印刷术以及大觉醒运动和启蒙运动等运动的兴起意味着，英国殖民地也是跨大西洋印刷文化的一部分，这促进了欧洲思想的传播。印刷的小册子、书籍和其他物品不仅促进了启蒙思想的传播，也促进了因大觉醒运动而产生的新宗教观的传播。

随着各种各样的人和思想跨越大西洋，殖民地的社会和文化发展起来。尽管殖民地的生活充满多元化，但随着时间的推移，也逐渐发生了英国化。这仅仅意味着各个殖民地都根据英国模式发展政治社群和机构。英国的习俗和规范被采纳。基于英国模式的政府程序成为常态。而这些模式受到殖民地间贸易、跨大西洋印刷文化的兴起以及新教福音派传播的影响。

这一切的一个结果是，在英属北美殖民地，一种盎格鲁-撒克逊的社会和文化兴起。然而，尽管殖民地将受到英国的很大影响，但与此同时，13 个殖民地的多元化程度也在显著发展，并发展成为各自不同的社会。

在我们的下一个视频中，我们将探讨法国和印第安人战争的影响——这将是一个改变游戏规则的事件。在那之前，非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！
