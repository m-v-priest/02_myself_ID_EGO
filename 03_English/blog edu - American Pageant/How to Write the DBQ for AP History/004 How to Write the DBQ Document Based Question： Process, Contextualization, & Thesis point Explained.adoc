== 释义

What's up, beautiful people? Today in this video, we are going to walk you through 引导；带领 the steps 步骤；措施 of writing both the LEQ (Long Essay Question) or the DBQ (Document-Based Question) for any of your AP (Advanced Placement) history classes. Now first piece of advice 建议 is gonna seem pretty obvious 显而易见的, but it's also very important, and step one is this: You've got to read the prompt 提示；题目. What is it saying? What is it asking? What historical 历史的 thinking skill 技能；技巧 is it assessing 评估；评定? And for this video in series 系列 of videos, we're gonna take a look at 审视；考察 this prompt in detail 详细地. This is the question we're gonna use, and if you take a look at it, you could tell it's a comparison 比较 question.

Before we go any further -- fun fact 有趣的事实 for you folks (非正式)各位 on the internet -- you might be wondering 纳闷；想知道 why in the heck (非正式)究竟；到底 am I telling you to read the question? You are an advanced placement student. Obviously 显然地；明显地 you know you need to read the question. But you might not actually 实际上；事实上 know that AP does not stand for advanced placement -- it stands for answer the prompt. And what a lot of students do -- a big mistake a lot of students do -- is they don't read the prompt correctly 正确地；准确地. So when I say read the prompt, I mean read the question, understand 理解；明白 it, read it twice if necessary 必要的, and as you're reading it, mark 标记；标出 every part of the question that you need to answer. Break this bad boy down (非正式)彻底分析.

So let's take a look at 审视；考察 the prompt we're going to be using. And so if you take a look at this prompt, it says: "Compare and contrast 比较和对比 the development 发展；进步 of the New England and the Chesapeake colonial 殖民地的 regions 地区." So as already mentioned 提及, this is a comparison historical thinking skills type question, and you need to know what are they asking you. Is this an evaluate 评估；评价 the extent 程度；范围? Is this causation 因果关系? Continuity 连续性 and change over time? Know what they are asking. So for this particular 特定的；特别的 question, they want you to describe 描述；描写 and explain 解释；说明 the historical similarities 相似性；类似点 and/or differences 不同点；差异 between the New England and Chesapeake colonial regions.

Now that ain't it, fam (俚语)家人；朋友. There's more. This is AP. The second part of the question is: "Analyze 分析；研究 the reasons that by 1700 the regions had evolved into 演变成；发展成 two distinct 截然不同的；有明显区别的 societies 社会." So that's why it's really important you read the prompt carefully 仔细地, because you need to answer all parts of the question. So the second part of this question, you need to address 处理；应对 why the New England and the Chesapeake regions developed into two distinct societies.

Now once you figure out 弄清楚；明白 what the prompt is asking, you want to start thinking about how you're gonna organize 组织；安排 your thoughts. Sometimes it's simple -- they'll give you categories 类别；范畴: "Analyze 分析；研究 the social 社会的, religious 宗教的, economic 经济的, political 政治的 changes 变化 of a time period 时期；阶段." And this one kind of -- you know -- gives you some idea. You know you want to describe 描述；描写 and explain 解释；说明 the similarities between the two regions and also the differences. So perhaps 也许；可能 you're gonna kind of put the information that you start thinking about into these two buckets (非正式)类别 or these two areas that you're gonna explore. But it's important to remember that's not all you're doing. You're also, throughout 贯穿；遍及 your essay, going to need to examine 检查；审查 the reasons why they evolved into these two distinct societies.

The next step is you need to note 注意；留意 the time frame 时间范围. This is super important. What is the time frame the question is asking you about? And so for this particular 特定的；特别的 question, it says "by 1700," so any information that you use to defend 辩护；维护 your thesis 论文；论点 must take place before 在…之前 1700. Anything after 在…之后 that won't count. So if you talk about the French and Indian War 法国和印第安人战争 -- which I don't know why you would -- the First Great Awakening 第一次大觉醒运动 -- none of that is gonna get you any points for this particular essay. And usually 通常；一般地 they'll give you like a date range 日期范围. And so they don't in this one -- they say "by 1700," so you don't want to go past that date. But you know for this essay, it's safe to assume 可以肯定地说 that you can talk about most things from 1607, which is the foundation 建立；创立 of Jamestown 詹姆斯敦. If you stick within 坚持；固守 this time frame, any information you use to try to prove 证明；证实 your thesis would be eligible 合格的；符合条件的 for getting you points. So you don't want to go outside 超出；在…之外 the time frame.

The next thing I recommend 推荐；建议 is you do a quick brainstorm 集体讨论；头脑风暴 of any outside information. Whether or not you're doing an LEQ or a DBQ, start thinking about what do you know about this topic that you can kind of come up with 想出；提出. And so maybe when you first read it, you start thinking about these things. You don't really have any sense to them -- it's just information that is triggered 触发；引起 when you think about Chesapeake or the New England colonies 殖民地. Now you don't want to take too long on this, but with the quickness (非正式)迅速地, jot down 匆匆记下 anything that you may think is relevant 相关的；切题的. And this may be useful 有用的 when you're setting up 建立；设立 contextualization 背景化；语境化, your outside information, or even your thesis. Just as your process and the question, you're getting the brain doing any stuff.

Now if your brainstorm looks like this, you are in trouble. So if you can organize 组织；安排 your brainstorm into categories 类别；范畴 -- you know whether it be similarities 相似性；类似点 or differences 不同点；差异 between these two regions, or social 社会的 or political 政治的, whatever the buckets (非正式)类别 or categories that you're using -- but you want a quick brainstorm now. And if you're turning it into this dude (非正式)家伙, you just want to move on. And so quick checklist 清单: Within 在…之内；在…内部 the first two to three minutes max (maximum 的缩写)最多 -- I'm talking about you know in the first two to three minutes -- you want to read the prompt, break down 分解；拆分 the prompt, note 注意；留意 the date range 日期范围, brainstorm outside information. But like I said, no more than 不超过 two to three minutes on this process.

Now if you are working on 从事；处理 the DBQ -- which all you 2020 folks (非正式)各位, that's only what you're gonna be doing -- you would then begin to read and annotate 注释；评注 the document. And I'm going to be doing a separate 分开的；不同的 video about how to approach 处理；对待 the documents, how to use them as evidence 证据. But assuming 假设；假定 you have finished reading and annotating the documents or you're doing an LEQ, the question is now what do you do next? And that leads us to our next step is actually 实际上；事实上 writing this essay and hopefully 有希望地；但愿 knocking the bad boy out (非正式)彻底完成.

And the first thing most students write -- in the first point you really should get -- is your contextualization 背景化；语境化 point. And so a quick little look at 审视；考察 the rubric 评分标准 for contextualization. Here's what the College Board says about contextualization. Like I said, it should be your first point, and it describes 描述；描写 a broader 更广泛的 historical context 历史背景 relevant 相关的；切题的 to the prompt. And you can keep reading right there. And you're probably 可能；大概 wondering 纳闷；想知道 what's up with (非正式)怎么回事 the Star Wars crawl (星球大战片头字幕)? That's a good way of thinking about contextualization -- very similar 相似的 to the Star Wars crawl. And what I mean by that is contextualization gives your reader the broader historical context that is relevant to the prompt. And if you've seen the first Star Wars -- A New Hope -- the opening crawl gives you all sorts of 各种各样的 background info (information 的缩写)背景信息 necessary 必要的 to understanding 理解；明白 the film. You know it's also similar to 类似于 like how TV shows will oftentimes 经常；往往 do "previously on" (之前剧情回顾), and if you read the crawl, basically 基本上；主要地 you learn all this stuff that helps you -- the viewer 观众 -- make sense of 理解；明白 what's been going down (非正式)发生；进行 prior to 在…之前 the film. The context 背景 provided 提供；供给 by the crawl sets the scene 为…设置场景 for the movie to come, and without this context, you'd probably 可能；大概 be hecka (非正式)非常 confused 困惑的.

And so that's what you really want to do for your contextualization. Think of contextualization as setting up 建立；设置 the scene. You're bringing the reader into your thesis statement 论点陈述 that you will make, and you're not just jumping right into 直接切入 your argument 论点；观点 -- you're setting the mood 营造气氛. And so contextualization -- a good way of thinking about it is it should go in your intro paragraph (introduction paragraph 的缩写)引言段落 -- even though 虽然；尽管 that's not a requirement 要求 -- that's just as good writing. And you should think of it like this: You're starting broad to get the reader to your thesis, and contextualization should be around 大约 three to four sentences that connect to 与…联系；与…相关 the broader events related to 与…相关 the prompt and your argument.

Now this can't be super vague 含糊不清的. You need to provide 提供；供给 at least 至少 -- and probably 可能；大概 more -- at least two specific 具体的；明确的 examples 例子, historical details 历史细节 that help the reader understand 理解；明白 the time frame 时间范围 that's relevant 相关的；切题的 to the prompt, and you bring it in to your thesis statement. What it's not: It is not just vague sentences that lack 缺乏 any specifics 细节. You know you can't be super vague about the time period. You can't just say "tensions 紧张局势 were increasing," "things were really bad," "people united 团结的；联合的." That's not helpful 有帮助的, and it's not gonna get you any points. You need to offer 提供；供给 the reader some details. You know likewise 同样地；类似地, it can't -- contextualization should not be super detailed 非常详细的 information that does not connect to 与…联系；与…相关 the prompt. The information that you give needs to be meaningful 有意义的 to the prompt.

So a lot of stuff happened before 在…之前 the prompt time period 时期；阶段 that we're looking at 审视；考察 in this particular 特定的；特别的 video -- 1700 -- but you're not going to get into 深入探讨 a whole bunch of 一大堆；许多 stuff about Columbus 哥伦布 and you know his colonization 殖民 and the Columbian Exchange 哥伦布大交换. You know it's not really relevant 相关的；切题的 to this particular prompt, although 虽然；尽管 it is part of this bigger picture of colonization -- it's not gonna get you any points for this particular essay. The other thing to keep in mind 牢记于心 is contextualization is not getting into evidence 证据 that answers the question. So if you're writing a DBQ, this is not the time to throw in (非正式)随便说出 your analysis 分析；研究 of the documents. You don't want to get stuck in the weeds (非正式)陷入困境 here. You know don't give us everything you know about the foundation 建立；创立 of Jamestown or the first Thanksgiving 感恩节 or Pocahontas's wardrobe (衣橱里的)全部衣服. You want to set up 建立；设置 the broader 更广泛的 historical processes 历史进程 that are relevant to this prompt.

So let's take a look at 审视；考察 a couple of 几个 examples 例子. This one is not contextualization -- although 虽然；尽管 the student tried to pass it off as such 冒充: "The British founded 建立；创立 many colonies 殖民地 in the New World 新大陆." And you know what? That's not untrue, but it's super vague 含糊不清的, and it doesn't really show an understanding 理解；明白 of the time period 时期；阶段. If you keep reading, they also go on to say 继续说: "These colonies would eventually 最终；终于 become the United States." And once again 再次；又一次, they're not wrong, but none of this information has a meaningful 有意义的 connection to 与…联系；与…相关 the prompt that we're looking at 审视；考察 right there above 在…上方, nor does it show an understanding of the historical process occurring before 在…之前 1700. And so without those things, you don't get points.

They also go on to say that: "These regions would unite 联合；团结 to fight the British in the American Revolution 美国革命." That's correct 正确的 but not relevant 相关的；切题的 for this prompt. And the next part that they have is: "And they were established 建立；设立 -- the colonies were established for different reasons and by different groups of people." Now here they're actually 实际上；事实上 starting to answer the question that was asked, but once again 再次；又一次, they don't really discuss 讨论；论述 the historical process occurring prior to 在…之前 1700. You've got to have some events 事件, some people, some moments 时刻 to demonstrate 表明；证明 you understand 理解；明白 the big picture 大局；全貌, and this particular 特定的；特别的 attempt 尝试 fails miserably 彻底失败.

So what's an example of contextualization that actually 实际上；事实上 gets the points? Here is one for you: "England sought to 寻求；试图 compete with 与…竞争 Spain and France for colonies in North America 北美洲. While Spain was the first with the settlement 定居点 of Saint Augustine 圣奥古斯丁, England would soon join the race for colonies with the establishment 建立；创立 of Jamestown and Plymouth 普利茅斯. Since colonization 殖民 proved 证明；证实 expensive 昂贵的, both colonies would be paid for by the establishment of joint stock companies 股份公司." Now this particular 特定的；特别的 attempt does demonstrate 表明；证明 an understanding 理解；明白 of the big picture prior to 在…之前 1700, and it does directly 直接地 have relevance 相关性；关联 to the prompt. They provide 提供；供给 way more than two specific 具体的；明确的 historical details 历史细节, and they do a really good job at kind of setting this essay up.

Let's take a look at 审视；考察 another one: "England's colonization of North America began with the first permanent 永久的；持久的 English settlement at Jamestown. To encourage 鼓励；激励 colonization, England offered charters 特许状；执照 in the New World 新大陆 to prospective 未来的；有希望的 settlers 定居者, and various 各种各样的 joint-stock companies were set up 建立；设立 to help finance 资助；为…提供资金 the high price of setting up a colony. As the mother country 母国, England pursued 追求；实行 colonization in an attempt to 试图；企图 enrich 使富裕；使丰富 the country as part of 作为…的一部分 the economic 经济的 theory 理论 of mercantilism 重商主义." Once again 再次；又一次, this particular 特定的；特别的 example does way more than you actually 实际上；事实上 need to. They have way more than two specific examples. They do connect 连接；联系 the events 事件 to the broader 更广泛的 time period 时期；阶段, and both of these would get the point without a doubt 毫无疑问. Both of these are examples of contextualization championship (锦标赛) responses 回应；回答.

So in your introductory paragraph 引言段落, you should be able to get two points, because after 在…之后 you write your contextualization, you should present 呈现；展示 your thesis 论文；论点. And if you take a look at 审视；考察 the rubric 评分标准, a thesis that gets the point responds to 回应；答复 the prompt with a historically defensible -- say with me folks (非正式)各位 -- historically defensible thesis or claim 主张；断言 that establishes 确立；建立 a line of reasoning 推理思路. So you need to do those two things. It's a quick little check. A thesis that gets the point must directly 直接地 answer all parts of the question. It must be historically defensible. You know you can use the language of the question in your thesis, but you must take a position 表明立场. And you also must have a line of reasoning. You know you can call these your sub-claims 子论点 -- the buckets (非正式)类别 that you put your information in. This will become your topic sentences 主题句 for your body paragraphs 主体段落. So you're organizing 组织；安排 your information, and you're having something that you're going to defend 辩护；维护.

Now a thesis can't just restate 重申；再次声明 the prompt. You can't just reword 改述；用不同的话说 the prompt. Obviously 显然地；明显地 you need to take a position 表明立场. And if you don't have a line of reasoning, you will not get the points. So if we're thinking about that prompt we've been talking about, here's one attempt 尝试 at a thesis. It says: "Before 在…之前 1700, the New England and Chesapeake colonies developed differently in each region." Once again 再次；又一次, they're not wrong, but they're just kind of restating the prompt. They're not taking a position, and they definitely 肯定地；无疑地 do not have a line of reasoning. So no point there.

Another attempt 尝试: "There were many similarities 相似性；类似点 and differences 不同点；差异 between the Chesapeake and New England colonies." This once again 再次；又一次 does not get a point because it doesn't do what it needs to do.

Here's a third one: "Before 在…之前 1700, the New England and Chesapeake colonies developed differently in each region. The New England colonies were tight-knit 紧密的；团结的 religious 宗教的 communities 社区, and the Chesapeake colonies were created for profit 利润；收益." Now I know a lot of you -- or maybe 也许；可能 some of you -- are saying: "Oh, that one -- that one has some meat on them bones (非正式)有实质内容." But that also would not get the point because it doesn't have a line of reasoning. It's not directly 直接地 answering that second part of the question.

Now some folks (非正式)人们 like to use a thesis formula 公式；模式. And two kind of popular 流行的 ones is: "X, however 然而 A, B, and C," or sometimes 有时 just "A and B, therefore 因此 Y," or "Although 虽然 X, Y because 因为 A, B, C." And if you're confused 困惑的 -- what the heck (非正式)究竟；到底? Basically 基本上；主要地 this is what these formulas are meant to represent 代表；象征. So for instance 例如；比如, X would represent 代表；象征 your counter-argument 反驳；反对论点 -- the best counterpoint 最好的对立点 to your thesis -- and then you would kind of present 呈现；展示 that. And then "however A, B, and C" -- these are your best kind of ideas or arguments 论点；观点 to defend 辩护；维护 your thesis -- your line of reasoning. And then Y would be your thesis or your argument.

So how does one of these formulas look if you actually 实际上；事实上 put it into action? So for instance 例如；比如, this would be an example using the formula above 在…之上: "Although 虽然 both the New England and Chesapeake regions faced difficulties 困难 with the indigenous people 土著居民 and were under 根据；在…之下 the mercantile system 重商主义体系" -- this would be kind of a counter-argument, they have some similarities -- "the motives 动机；目的 for colonization 殖民, the characteristics 特征；特点 of the colonists 殖民者, and the geography 地理 of the region contributed to 促成；导致 the New England area evolving into 演变成；发展成 tight-knit religious community and the Chesapeake region into a cash crop 经济作物 reliant 依赖的 society 社会 with numerous 众多的；许多 economic 经济的 and racial 种族的 tensions 紧张局势." So here you see the line of reasoning represented 代表；象征 by A, B, and C -- once again 再次；又一次 it can maybe 也许；可能 just be two things -- but this particular 特定的；特别的 person wrote three. And then Y being the argument. This would be an example of a thesis statement that would not only get the point but also presents that counter-argument which can help you get the complexity 复杂性 point later on -- and we'll get into 深入探讨 that in the next video.

Now chances are 很可能；多半 under stress 压力, a lot of you folks (非正式)各位 are going to abandon 放弃；抛弃 this formula 公式；模式, this type of thinking, and all of your writing skills are gonna collapse 崩溃；瓦解 faster than France 法国 did during World War Two 第二次世界大战. But if you want to try something like that, here's kind of a model 模型 that many people have used with success 成功. On the other hand 另一方面, you don't have to be a great writer to get the thesis point or to do well on the DBQ. All of these -- and you can hit pause if you want to read them -- are examples of thesis statements responding to 回应；答复 the question that we've been looking at 审视；考察. All of them got the full point. And so grammar 语法, punctuation 标点 errors 错误 don't necessarily 不一定 count against you 对你不利. And all of these thesis statements -- some of them have more than one sentence, some of them have grammatical errors, they don't follow a formula -- they all got the point because they do what a good thesis statement does: They directly 直接地 answer all parts of the question, they're historically defensible, and they have a line of reasoning. It doesn't need to look pretty, but you can get it done.

And that's why it's so important that you get those two points in your introductory paragraph 引言段落 where you knock out (非正式)迅速完成 your contextualization 背景化；语境化, you have a really solid 扎实的；可靠的 thesis that also has a counter-argument embedded 嵌入 in it, so you're set up for 为…做好准备 getting the complexity 复杂性 point a little bit later, and having a great intro paragraph really sets you up for success 成功 throughout 贯穿；遍及 the rest of your essay.

Now regardless of 不管；无论 formulas 公式；模式 and writing, I can't stress this enough 再三强调: Knowing your content 内容 is so important. You can't defend 辩护；维护 or have an argument 论点；观点 if you don't know the history. So that's why at apushexplained.com, we got all sorts of 各种各样的 videos that break down 分解；解析 the key concepts 关键概念 and the content in a way that hopefully 有希望地；但愿 will make it easier for you on your exam. Thank you for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天的视频中，我们将带你了解为你的任何 AP 历史课程撰写 LEQ 或 DBQ 的步骤。现在，第一个建议可能看起来很明显，但它也非常重要，第一步就是：你必须阅读题目。它在说什么？它在问什么？它在评估哪种历史思维技能？在本视频系列中，我们将详细研究这个题目。这是我们将要使用的题目，如果你仔细看看，你会发现这是一个比较问题。

在我们继续之前——给互联网上的各位一个有趣的事实——你可能想知道我到底为什么要告诉你阅读问题？你是一名大学先修课程的学生。显然你知道你需要阅读问题。但你可能实际上不知道 AP 并不代表大学先修课程——它代表回答题目（Answer the Prompt）。很多学生所犯的一个大错误就是他们没有正确阅读题目。所以当我告诉你阅读题目时，我的意思是阅读问题，理解它，如有必要阅读两次，并且在阅读时，标记你需要回答的每个部分。彻底分解这个问题。

所以让我们来看看我们将要使用的题目。如果你仔细看看这个题目，它说：“比较和对比新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地区的发展。”正如已经提到的，这是一个比较历史思维技能类型的问题，你需要知道他们在问你什么。这是一个评估程度的问题吗？是关于因果关系？还是关于随着时间的推移的连续性和变化？了解他们在问什么。对于这个问题，他们希望你描述和解释新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地区之间历史上的相似之处和/或不同之处。

但这还没完，朋友们。还有更多。这是 AP。问题的第二部分是：“分析到 1700 年这两个地区演变成两个截然不同的社会的原因。”这就是为什么仔细阅读题目非常重要，因为你需要回答问题的各个部分。所以这个问题的第二部分，你需要说明为什么新英格兰和切萨皮克地区发展成为两个截然不同的社会。

一旦你弄清楚题目在问什么，你就要开始思考如何组织你的想法。有时很简单——他们会给你类别：“分析一个时期的社会、宗教、经济、政治变革。”而这个问题有点——你知道的——给你一些想法。你知道你需要描述和解释这两个地区之间的相似之处，以及不同之处。所以也许你会把你开始思考的信息放入这两个“桶”或这两个你将要探索的领域。但重要的是要记住，这并不是你所做的全部。在你的整篇论文中，你还需要考察它们演变成这两个截然不同的社会的原因。

下一步是你需要注意时间范围。这非常重要。问题问的是哪个时间范围？对于这个问题，它说“到 1700 年”，所以你用来支持你的论点的任何信息都必须发生在 1700 年之前。之后的任何信息都不算数。所以如果你谈论法国和印第安战争——我不知道你为什么要谈论——第一次大觉醒运动——所有这些都不会让你在这篇特定的论文中获得任何分数。通常他们会给你一个日期范围。而这个问题没有——它说“到 1700 年”，所以你不想超过这个日期。但你知道对于这篇论文，可以安全地假设你可以谈论 1607 年之后的大部分事情，那是詹姆斯敦建立的时间。如果你在这个时间范围内，你用来证明你的论点的任何信息都有资格让你获得分数。所以你不想超出时间范围。

我建议的下一步是对任何外部信息进行快速的头脑风暴。无论你是在做 LEQ 还是 DBQ，开始思考你对这个主题有哪些了解，你可以想出什么。所以也许当你第一次阅读它时，你会开始思考这些事情。你对它们没有任何真正的概念——这只是当你想到切萨皮克或新英格兰殖民地时触发的信息。现在你不想在这上面花费太长时间，但要快速地记下你可能认为相关的任何事情。这在你构建背景化、你的外部信息甚至你的论点时可能很有用。就像你的过程和问题一样，你让大脑开始运转。

现在如果你的头脑风暴看起来像这样，你就麻烦了。所以如果你能把你的头脑风暴组织成类别——你知道无论是这两个地区之间的相似之处还是不同之处，还是社会或政治，无论你使用什么“桶”或类别——但你现在需要一个快速的头脑风暴。如果你把它变成这样，你只想继续前进。所以快速检查清单：在最多两到三分钟内——我说的是在最初的两到三分钟内——你想阅读题目，分解题目，注意日期范围，头脑风暴外部信息。但就像我说过的，这个过程不超过两到三分钟。

现在如果你正在做 DBQ——你们所有 2020 年的人，那将是你们唯一要做的——你将开始阅读和注释文献。我将制作一个单独的视频关于如何处理文献，如何将它们用作证据。但假设你已经完成了阅读和注释文献，或者你正在做 LEQ，现在的问题是你接下来做什么？这就引出了我们的下一步，实际上是撰写这篇论文，并希望把它搞定。

大多数学生写的第一件事——也是你真正应该获得的第一分——是你的背景化分。所以快速看一下背景化的评分标准。这是大学理事会关于背景化的说法。就像我说过的，它应该是你的第一分，它描述了与题目相关的更广泛的历史背景。你可以继续阅读那里。你可能想知道星球大战的片头字幕是怎么回事？那是思考背景化的一个好方法——非常类似于星球大战的片头字幕。我的意思是，背景化为你的读者提供了与题目相关的更广泛的历史背景。如果你看过第一部星球大战——新希望——开头的字幕提供了理解这部电影所需的所有背景信息。你知道它也类似于电视节目经常做的“此前剧情回顾”，如果你阅读字幕，你基本上会了解所有这些信息，这些信息帮助你——观众——理解电影之前发生的事情。字幕提供的背景为即将上映的电影奠定了基础，没有这个背景，你可能会非常困惑。

这就是你真正想要为你的背景化所做的事情。把背景化想象成设置场景。你正在引导读者进入你将提出的论点陈述，而你不仅仅是直接进入你的论点——你正在营造气氛。所以背景化——一个好的思考方式是它应该放在你的引言段落中——即使这不是一个要求——但这只是好的写作。你应该这样想：你从广泛的层面开始，引导读者理解你的论点，背景化应该大约三到四句话，与题目和你的论点相关的更广泛的事件相关联。

现在这不能太模糊。你需要提供至少——可能更多——至少两个具体的例子，历史细节，帮助读者理解与题目相关的时间范围，并将其引入你的论点陈述。它不是什么：它不是仅仅缺乏任何具体性的模糊句子。你知道你不能对时间段过于模糊。你不能仅仅说“紧张局势正在加剧”，“情况非常糟糕”，“人们团结起来”。这没有帮助，也不会让你获得任何分数。你需要向读者提供一些细节。你知道同样，它不能——背景化不应该是与题目无关的过于详细的信息。你提供的信息需要对题目有意义。

所以在我们正在看的这个特定视频的题目时间段——1700 年——之前发生了很多事情，但你不会深入探讨关于哥伦布以及他的殖民化和哥伦布大交换的很多事情。你知道它与这个特定的题目并不真正相关，尽管它是这个更大的殖民化图景的一部分——但它不会让你在这篇特定的论文中获得任何分数。你需要记住的另一件事是，背景化不是进入回答问题的证据。所以如果你正在写 DBQ，这不是你抛出你对文献分析的时候。你不想在这里陷入困境。你知道不要给我们你所知道的关于詹姆斯敦的建立或第一个感恩节或波卡洪塔的衣橱的所有信息。你想建立与这个题目相关的更广泛的历史进程。

让我们看几个例子。这个不是背景化——尽管学生试图把它当作背景化：“英国在新世界建立了许多殖民地。”你知道吗？这并非不真实，但它非常模糊，并且没有真正显示出对该时间段的理解。如果你继续阅读，他们还说：“这些殖民地最终将成为美国。”再次，他们没有错，但这些信息都没有与我们上面看到的题目有意义的联系，也没有显示出对 1700 年之前发生的历史进程的理解。所以没有这些东西，你就得不到分数。

他们还继续说：“这些地区将联合起来在美国革命中与英国作战。”这是正确的，但与这个题目无关。他们接下来的部分是：“它们——这些殖民地——是由于不同的原因和由不同的人群建立的。”现在他们实际上开始回答所提出的问题，但再次，他们并没有真正讨论 1700 年之前发生的历史进程。你必须有一些事件、一些人、一些时刻来证明你理解大局，而这个特定的尝试彻底失败了。

那么，一个真正能得分的背景化例子是什么？这是一个给你：“英国试图与西班牙和法国争夺北美洲的殖民地。虽然西班牙是第一个建立圣奥古斯丁的，但英国很快就会加入殖民地的竞争，建立詹姆斯敦和普利茅斯。由于殖民化成本高昂，这两个殖民地都将通过建立股份公司来支付费用。”这个特定的尝试确实展示了对 1700 年之前大局的理解，并且它直接与题目相关。他们提供了远不止两个具体的历史细节，并且他们在这篇论文的开篇做得非常好。

让我们再看一个：“英国对北美洲的殖民化始于在詹姆斯敦建立的第一个永久性英国定居点。为了鼓励殖民化，英国向潜在的定居者提供了在新世界的特许权，并成立了各种股份公司来帮助支付建立殖民地的高昂费用。作为母国，英国奉行殖民化是为了丰富国家，这是重商主义经济理论的一部分。”再次，这个特定的例子做得远超你实际需要的。他们提供了远不止两个具体的例子。他们确实将这些事件与更广泛的时间段联系起来，这两个例子毫无疑问都能得分。这两个都是背景化冠军级的回答。

所以在你的引言段落中，你应该能够获得两分，因为在你写完背景化之后，你应该提出你的论点。如果你看一下评分标准，一个能得分的论点用一个在历史上站得住脚的——大家跟我一起说——在历史上站得住脚的论点或主张来回应题目，并确立一个论证思路。所以你需要做这两件事。这是一个快速检查。一个能得分的论点必须直接回答问题的各个部分。它必须在历史上站得住脚。你知道你可以在你的论点中使用问题的措辞，但你必须采取立场。而且你还必须有一个论证思路。你知道你可以称这些为你的子论点——你用来组织信息的“桶”。这将成为你主体段落的主题句。所以你正在组织你的信息，并且你有一个你要捍卫的东西。

现在一个论点不能只是重复题目。你不能只是改写题目。显然你需要采取立场。如果你没有论证思路，你就得不到分数。所以如果我们思考我们一直在讨论的那个题目，这是一个论点的尝试。它说：“在 1700 年之前，新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地在每个地区的发展都不同。”再次，他们没有错，但他们只是在某种程度上重复题目。他们没有采取立场，而且他们绝对没有论证思路。所以这里没有分数。

另一个尝试：“切萨皮克和新英格兰殖民地之间有很多相似之处和不同之处。”这同样没有得分，因为它没有做到它需要做的事情。

这是第三个：“在 1700 年之前，新英格兰和切萨皮克殖民地在每个地区的发展都不同。新英格兰殖民地是紧密的宗教社区，而切萨皮克殖民地是为了利润而建立的。”现在我知道你们很多人——或者可能有些人——会说：“哦，那个——那个有点内容。”但那也不会得分，因为它没有论证思路。它没有直接回答问题的第二部分。

现在有些人喜欢使用论点公式。两个比较流行的公式是：“X，然而 A、B 和 C”，或者有时只是“A 和 B，因此 Y”，或者“尽管 X，Y 因为 A、B、C”。如果你感到困惑——这到底是什么？基本上这些公式旨在代表这些。例如，X 将代表你的反驳论点——对你的论点的最佳反驳——然后你将某种程度上提出它。“然而 A、B 和 C”——这些是你捍卫你的论点的最佳想法或论据——你的论证思路。然后 Y 将是你的论点或你的主张。

那么如果你实际运用其中一个公式，它会是什么样子呢？例如，这将是使用上述公式的一个例子：“尽管新英格兰和切萨皮克地区都面临着与当地人民的困难，并且都处于重商主义体系之下”——这将是一种反驳论点，它们有一些相似之处——“殖民化的动机、殖民者的特点以及该地区的地理环境促成了新英格兰地区发展成为紧密的宗教社区，而切萨皮克地区发展成为依赖经济作物、存在众多经济和种族紧张关系的社会。”在这里你看到了由 A、B 和 C 代表的论证思路——再次强调，它可能只有两点——但这个人写了三点。然后 Y 是论点。这将是一个不仅能得分而且还提出了反驳论点的论点陈述的例子，这可以帮助你稍后获得复杂性分——我们将在下一个视频中讨论这一点。

现在很可能在压力下，你们很多人会放弃这个公式，这种思维方式，而你们所有的写作技巧都会比二战期间的法国崩溃得更快。但如果你想尝试类似的方法，这是一个很多人成功使用的模型。另一方面，你不必成为一个伟大的作家才能获得论点分或在 DBQ 中表现出色。所有这些——如果你想阅读，可以暂停——都是回应我们一直在讨论的问题的论点陈述的例子。它们都获得了满分。所以语法、标点错误不一定会扣分。所有这些论点陈述——有些不止一句话，有些有语法错误，它们没有遵循任何公式——它们都获得了分数，因为它们做到了一个好的论点陈述所做的事情：它们直接回答了问题的各个部分，它们在历史上站得住脚，并且它们有一个论证思路。它不需要看起来很漂亮，但你可以完成它。

这就是为什么在你的引言段落中获得这两分如此重要，在那里你搞定了你的背景化，你有一个非常扎实的论点，其中还嵌入了一个反驳论点，所以你为稍后获得复杂性分做好了准备，并且有一个好的引言段落真的为你整篇论文的成功奠定了基础。

现在，不管公式和写作如何，我怎么强调都不为过：了解你的内容非常重要。如果你不了解历史，你就无法捍卫或提出论点。这就是为什么在 apushexplained.com 上，我们有各种各样的视频，以一种希望能让你的考试更容易的方式分解关键概念和内容。感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！

What's up, beautiful people? Today in this video, we are going to walk you through the steps of writing both the LEQ or the DBQ for any of your AP history classes. Now first piece of advice is gonna seem pretty obvious, but it's also very important, and step one is this: You've got to read the prompt. What is it saying? What is it asking? What historical thinking skill is it assessing? And for this video in series of videos, we're gonna take a look at this prompt in detail. This is the question we're gonna use, and if you take a look at it, you could tell it's a comparison question.

Before we go any further -- fun fact for you folks on the internet -- you might be wondering why in the heck am I telling you to read the question? You are an advanced placement student. Obviously you know you need to read the question. But you might not actually know that AP does not stand for advanced placement -- it stands for answer the prompt. And what a lot of students do -- a big mistake a lot of students do -- is they don't read the prompt correctly. So when I say read the prompt, I mean read the question, understand it, read it twice if necessary, and as you're reading it, mark every part of the question that you need to answer. Break this bad boy down.

So let's take a look at the prompt we're going to be using. And so if you take a look at this prompt, it says: "Compare and contrast the development of the New England and the Chesapeake colonial regions." So as already mentioned, this is a comparison historical thinking skills type question, and you need to know what are they asking you. Is this an evaluate the extent? Is this causation? Continuity and change over time? Know what they are asking. So for this particular question, they want you to describe and explain the historical similarities and/or differences between the New England and Chesapeake colonial regions.

Now that ain't it, fam. There's more. This is AP. The second part of the question is: "Analyze the reasons that by 1700 the regions had evolved into two distinct societies." So that's why it's really important you read the prompt carefully, because you need to answer all parts of the question. So the second part of this question, you need to address why the New England and the Chesapeake regions developed into two distinct societies.

Now once you figure out what the prompt is asking, you want to start thinking about how you're gonna organize your thoughts. Sometimes it's simple -- they'll give you categories: "Analyze the social, religious, economic, political changes of a time period." And this one kind of -- you know -- gives you some idea. You know you want to describe and explain the similarities between the two regions and also the differences. So perhaps you're gonna kind of put the information that you start thinking about into these two buckets or these two areas that you're gonna explore. But it's important to remember that's not all you're doing. You're also, throughout your essay, going to need to examine the reasons why they evolved into these two distinct societies.

The next step is you need to note the time frame. This is super important. What is the time frame the question is asking you about? And so for this particular question, it says "by 1700," so any information that you use to defend your thesis must take place before 1700. Anything after that won't count. So if you talk about the French and Indian War -- which I don't know why you would -- the First Great Awakening -- none of that is gonna get you any points for this particular essay. And usually they'll give you like a date range. And so they don't in this one -- they say "by 1700," so you don't want to go past that date. But you know for this essay, it's safe to assume that you can talk about most things from 1607, which is the foundation of Jamestown. If you stick within this time frame, any information you use to try to prove your thesis would be eligible for getting you points. So you don't want to go outside the time frame.

The next thing I recommend is you do a quick brainstorm of any outside information. Whether or not you're doing an LEQ or a DBQ, start thinking about what do you know about this topic that you can kind of come up with. And so maybe when you first read it, you start thinking about these things. You don't really have any sense to them -- it's just information that is triggered when you think about Chesapeake or the New England colonies. Now you don't want to take too long on this, but with the quickness, jot down anything that you may think is relevant. And this may be useful when you're setting up contextualization, your outside information, or even your thesis. Just as your process and the question, you're getting the brain doing any stuff.

Now if your brainstorm looks like this, you are in trouble. So if you can organize your brainstorm into categories -- you know whether it be similarities or differences between these two regions, or social or political, whatever the buckets or categories that you're using -- but you want a quick brainstorm now. And if you're turning it into this dude, you just want to move on. And so quick checklist: Within the first two to three minutes max -- I'm talking about you know in the first two to three minutes -- you want to read the prompt, break down the prompt, note the date range, brainstorm outside information. But like I said, no more than two to three minutes on this process.

Now if you are working on the DBQ -- which all you 2020 folks, that's only what you're gonna be doing -- you would then begin to read and annotate the document. And I'm going to be doing a separate video about how to approach the documents, how to use them as evidence. But assuming you have finished reading and annotating the documents or you're doing an LEQ, the question is now what do you do next? And that leads us to our next step is actually writing this essay and hopefully knocking the bad boy out.

And the first thing most students write -- in the first point you really should get -- is your contextualization point. And so a quick little look at the rubric for contextualization. Here's what the College Board says about contextualization. Like I said, it should be your first point, and it describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. And you can keep reading right there. And you're probably wondering what's up with the Star Wars crawl? That's a good way of thinking about contextualization -- very similar to the Star Wars crawl. And what I mean by that is contextualization gives your reader the broader historical context that is relevant to the prompt. And if you've seen the first Star Wars -- A New Hope -- the opening crawl gives you all sorts of background info necessary to understanding the film. You know it's also similar to like how TV shows will oftentimes do "previously on," and if you read the crawl, basically you learn all this stuff that helps you -- the viewer -- make sense of what's been going down prior to the film. The context provided by the crawl sets the scene for the movie to come, and without this context, you'd probably be hecka confused.

And so that's what you really want to do for your contextualization. Think of contextualization as setting up the scene. You're bringing the reader into your thesis statement that you will make, and you're not just jumping right into your argument -- you're setting the mood. And so contextualization -- a good way of thinking about it is it should go in your intro paragraph -- even though that's not a requirement -- that's just as good writing. And you should think of it like this: You're starting broad to get the reader to your thesis, and contextualization should be around three to four sentences that connect to the broader events related to the prompt and your argument.

Now this can't be super vague. You need to provide at least -- and probably more -- at least two specific examples, historical details that help the reader understand the time frame that's relevant to the prompt, and you bring it in to your thesis statement. What it's not: It is not just vague sentences that lack any specifics. You know you can't be super vague about the time period. You can't just say "tensions were increasing," "things were really bad," "people united." That's not helpful, and it's not gonna get you any points. You need to offer the reader some details. You know likewise, it can't -- contextualization should not be super detailed information that does not connect to the prompt. The information that you give needs to be meaningful to the prompt.

So a lot of stuff happened before the prompt time period that we're looking at in this particular video -- 1700 -- but you're not going to get into a whole bunch of stuff about Columbus and you know his colonization and the Columbian Exchange. You know it's not really relevant to this particular prompt, although it is part of this bigger picture of colonization -- it's not gonna get you any points for this particular essay. The other thing to keep in mind is contextualization is not getting into evidence that answers the question. So if you're writing a DBQ, this is not the time to throw in your analysis of the documents. You don't want to get stuck in the weeds here. You know don't give us everything you know about the foundation of Jamestown or the first Thanksgiving or Pocahontas's wardrobe. You want to set up the broader historical processes that are relevant to this prompt.

So let's take a look at a couple of examples. This one is not contextualization -- although the student tried to pass it off as such: "The British founded many colonies in the New World." And you know what? That's not untrue, but it's super vague, and it doesn't really show an understanding of the time period. If you keep reading, they also go on to say: "These colonies would eventually become the United States." And once again, they're not wrong, but none of this information has a meaningful connection to the prompt that we're looking at right there above, nor does it show an understanding of the historical process occurring before 1700. And so without those things, you don't get points.

They also go on to say that: "These regions would unite to fight the British in the American Revolution." That's correct but not relevant for this prompt. And the next part that they have is: "And they were established -- the colonies were established for different reasons and by different groups of people." Now here they're actually starting to answer the question that was asked, but once again, they don't really discuss the historical process occurring prior to 1700. You've got to have some events, some people, some moments to demonstrate you understand the big picture, and this particular attempt fails miserably.

So what's an example of contextualization that actually gets the points? Here is one for you: "England sought to compete with Spain and France for colonies in North America. While Spain was the first with the settlement of Saint Augustine, England would soon join the race for colonies with the establishment of Jamestown and Plymouth. Since colonization proved expensive, both colonies would be paid for by the establishment of joint stock companies." Now this particular attempt does demonstrate an understanding of the big picture prior to 1700, and it does directly have relevance to the prompt. They provide way more than two specific historical details, and they do a really good job at kind of setting this essay up.

Let's take a look at another one: "England's colonization of North America began with the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown. To encourage colonization, England offered charters in the New World to prospective settlers, and various joint-stock companies were set up to help finance the high price of setting up a colony. As the mother country, England pursued colonization in an attempt to enrich the country as part of the economic theory of mercantilism." Once again, this particular example does way more than you actually need to. They have way more than two specific examples. They do connect the events to the broader time period, and both of these would get the point without a doubt. Both of these are examples of contextualization championship responses.

So in your introductory paragraph, you should be able to get two points, because after you write your contextualization, you should present your thesis. And if you take a look at the rubric, a thesis that gets the point responds to the prompt with a historically defensible -- say with me folks -- historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. So you need to do those two things. It's a quick little check. A thesis that gets the point must directly answer all parts of the question. It must be historically defensible. You know you can use the language of the question in your thesis, but you must take a position. And you also must have a line of reasoning. You know you can call these your sub-claims -- the buckets that you put your information in. This will become your topic sentences for your body paragraphs. So you're organizing your information, and you're having something that you're going to defend.

Now a thesis can't just restate the prompt. You can't just reword the prompt. Obviously you need to take a position. And if you don't have a line of reasoning, you will not get the points. So if we're thinking about that prompt we've been talking about, here's one attempt at a thesis. It says: "Before 1700, the New England and Chesapeake colonies developed differently in each region." Once again, they're not wrong, but they're just kind of restating the prompt. They're not taking a position, and they definitely do not have a line of reasoning. So no point there.

Another attempt: "There were many similarities and differences between the Chesapeake and New England colonies." This once again does not get a point because it doesn't do what it needs to do.

Here's a third one: "Before 1700, the New England and Chesapeake colonies developed differently in each region. The New England colonies were tight-knit religious communities, and the Chesapeake colonies were created for profit." Now I know a lot of you -- or maybe some of you -- are saying: "Oh, that one -- that one has some meat on them bones." But that also would not get the point because it doesn't have a line of reasoning. It's not directly answering that second part of the question.

Now some folks like to use a thesis formula. And two kind of popular ones is: "X, however A, B, and C," or sometimes just "A and B, therefore Y," or "Although X, Y because A, B, C." And if you're confused -- what the heck? Basically this is what these formulas are meant to represent. So for instance, X would represent your counter-argument -- the best counterpoint to your thesis -- and then you would kind of present that. And then "however A, B, and C" -- these are your best kind of ideas or arguments to defend your thesis -- your line of reasoning. And then Y would be your thesis or your argument.

So how does one of these formulas look if you actually put it into action? So for instance, this would be an example using the formula above: "Although both the New England and Chesapeake regions faced difficulties with the indigenous people and were under the mercantile system" -- this would be kind of a counter-argument, they have some similarities -- "the motives for colonization, the characteristics of the colonists, and the geography of the region contributed to the New England area evolving into tight-knit religious community and the Chesapeake region into a cash crop reliant society with numerous economic and racial tensions." So here you see the line of reasoning represented by A, B, and C -- once again it can maybe just be two things -- but this particular person wrote three. And then Y being the argument. This would be an example of a thesis statement that would not only get the point but also presents that counter-argument which can help you get the complexity point later on -- and we'll get into that in the next video.

Now chances are under stress, a lot of you folks are going to abandon this formula, this type of thinking, and all of your writing skills are gonna collapse faster than France did during World War Two. But if you want to try something like that, here's kind of a model that many people have used with success. On the other hand, you don't have to be a great writer to get the thesis point or to do well on the DBQ. All of these -- and you can hit pause if you want to read them -- are examples of thesis statements responding to the question that we've been looking at. All of them got the full point. And so grammar, punctuation errors don't necessarily count against you. And all of these thesis statements -- some of them have more than one sentence, some of them have grammatical errors, they don't follow a formula -- they all got the point because they do what a good thesis statement does: They directly answer all parts of the question, they're historically defensible, and they have a line of reasoning. It doesn't need to look pretty, but you can get it done.

And that's why it's so important that you get those two points in your introductory paragraph where you knock out your contextualization, you have a really solid thesis that also has a counter-argument embedded in it, so you're set up for getting the complexity point a little bit later, and having a great intro paragraph really sets you up for success throughout the rest of your essay.

Now regardless of formulas and writing, I can't stress this enough: Knowing your content is so important. You can't defend or have an argument if you don't know the history. So that's why at apushexplained.com, we got all sorts of videos that break down the key concepts and the content in a way that hopefully will make it easier for you on your exam. Thank you for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!
