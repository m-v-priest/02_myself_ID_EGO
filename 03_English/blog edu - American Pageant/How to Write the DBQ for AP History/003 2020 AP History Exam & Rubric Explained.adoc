== 释义


What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're gonna take a look at 审视；考察 what's in store for you 等待着你 if you are taking an AP (Advanced Placement) History exam in the year 2020. If you don't know, an AP History modified 修改过的 DBQ (Document-Based Question) rubric 评分标准 is coming for you this year. Everything is completely 完全地；彻底地 different, and the big difference is you're gonna have 45 minutes for the entire 整个的 exam -- 45 minutes to write. It is going to be a DBQ, and you'll have five minutes to upload 上传 your answer to the College Board platform 平台. So it's just one question to define 定义；说明 your whole year in your AP history class.

One piece of good news: The DBQ can cover 覆盖；涉及 periods 时期；阶段 three through seven for AP US history. Pour 倒 a little apple juice for all the homies (俚语)朋友们, and periods one to eight and nine will not be a part of the DBQ this year. An important number you need to keep in mind 牢记于心 is the number ten. Ten is the number of these hot stuff Scotts when they did their dance routine (舞蹈)套路, and ten is the number of points you can get on the DBQ this year. So it's a modified rubric -- ten points are on it.

The first point is the same as always: You get one point for a thesis 论文；论点 or a claim 主张；断言. And what this is, is you respond to 回应；答复 the prompt 提示；题目 with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes 确立；建立 a line of reasoning 推理思路. So to get this point, you can't just rephrase 改述；用不同的话说 the prompt or restate 重申；再次声明 the prompt -- you've got to take a position 表明立场. And this is really the strength 力量；优势 of your essay: What are you going to argue? So it's important you get this point.

Next up is contextualization 背景化；语境化. This is the same as it's always been. This is where you describe 描述；描写 a broader 更广泛的 historical context 历史背景 relevant 相关的；切题的 to the prompt. And to earn this point, it must relate to 与…相关 the topic of the prompt to the broader historical events, developments 发展；进步, or processes 过程 that occur before 在…之前, during 在…期间, or continue after 在…之后 the timeframe 时间范围 of the question. So usually 通常；一般地 we say put your contextualization in the opening paragraph 开头段落 right below 在…下面 your thesis statement 论点陈述.

The bulk 大部分；主体 of your points are going to come from the evidence 证据 section 部分；环节 of the rubric. There are five points here, so you want to score some points in this section. And the first one should be a slam dunk (俚语)十拿九稳的事. This is using the content 内容 of at least 至少 two documents to address 处理；应对 the topic of the prompt. So to get this point, your response 回应；回答 must accurately 准确地；精确地 describe -- rather than simply quote 引用 -- the content from at least two of the documents. So just show that you know what the documents are all about. You don't even need to connect it to 与…联系；与…相关 your argument 论点；观点.

The next point that you can get in this section is you support 支持；支撑 an argument in response to 回应；答复 the prompt using two documents. So for this point, you need to take two documents and use the content of the documents to support your argument that you made in your thesis statement. So this is not just describing 描述；描写 the documents but using them as evidence 证据. And this one should be pretty easy to get as well. So you want to be able to knock these couple points out from the get-go (非正式)一开始.

This next one may be a little bit more difficult to get. This is when you support 支持；支撑 an argument in response to 回应；答复 the prompt using at least 至少 four documents. So you've got to use four documents. There're only going to be five documents on the DBQ -- you got to use four of them to advance 推进；促进 your argument. Quick math check: James K. Polk would point out 指出；强调 that that's three of the points so far 到目前为止 in the evidence section. So where are the other two? This goes to evidence beyond 超出；在…之外 the documents. So you got to go and look for this in that big brain of yours. You got to go and find stuff that's not in the documents.

And you can get one point if you use at least 至少 one additional 额外的；附加的 piece of historical evidence 历史证据 beyond 超出；在…之外 that found in the documents that is relevant 相关的；切题的 to an argument about the prompt. So you can't just bring in 引入；提及 any kind of random 随机的 historical fact -- it has to be relevant to the argument you're making. You can get another point if you describe 描述；描写 a second piece of outside information -- once again 再次；又一次, beyond 超出；在…之外 that found in the documents -- and it needs to be relevant to the prompt. So we got five points in the evidence section.

The next section 部分；环节 of the rubric is the analysis 分析；研究 and reasoning 推理 section. There are three points possible here, and this is where we get our HIPPO (Historical Context 历史背景, Intended Audience 预期读者, Purpose 目的, Point of View 观点, Organization 组织) points or your HIPPing documents -- or if you have a teacher that uses HAPPY (Historical Context 历史背景, Audience 读者, Purpose 目的, Point of View 观点, Why now? 为何此时？) like this guy's bright and shiny face -- that's where you get those points. And so one point is awarded for one document you explain 解释；说明 how or why the document's point of view, purpose, historical situation or context, and/or audience is relevant to an argument. So to get this point, your response 回应；回答 must explain how or why the different things -- that point of view, the purpose, the historical situation or audience -- is relevant to an argument. So you can't just say the point of view is this -- you've got to link it back to 与…联系起来 your argument.

And then you can get a second point if you do this same process -- the HIP process or the HAPPY process -- with the second document. The last part of the rubric is the complexity 复杂性 point. A lot of teachers call this the Unicorn Point (独角兽点，指难以获得的点), and this is awarded if you demonstrate 表明；证明 a complex 理解复杂的 understanding 理解；明白 of the historical development 历史发展 that is the focus 焦点；中心 of the prompt, using evidence 证据 to corroborate 证实；确证, qualify 限定；使…具有资格, or modify 修改；更改 an argument that addresses 处理；应对 the question. And so this is looking at 审视；考察 the complexities 复杂性 of history -- that nuance 细微差别, the kind of counter-argument 反驳；反对论点. And this can be awarded if you do this consistently 一致地；持续地 throughout 贯穿；遍及 the course of your essay. But it's really difficult 困难的 to get in a normal year, let alone 更不用说 in a goofy (非正式)傻的；滑稽的 year like 2020.

Now this is a very complex process. Most students -- most teachers -- feel beat up (非正式)筋疲力尽 when they're done writing or grading these things. So you need to hang in there 坚持下去. And you know, one thing I can't stress enough 再三强调 is knowing your content 内容. You could spend all day looking at this rubric trying to figure it out 弄明白 mathematically 数学上, kind of predict 预测；预料 what you will score. But if you don't know the history, you can't have an argument and you can't analyze 分析；研究 these sources 来源；出处. So content is king 内容为王. Historical thinking skills are important, but knowing the stuff is gonna be really important.

And if Theodore Roosevelt can get shot and give a speech with a bullet in him, you can handle 处理；应对 this DBQ. And if you need any help, you can go to apushexplained.com where there's all sorts of 各种各样的 free history and government 政治 videos. And most importantly 最重要的是, stay focused 保持专注, stay strong 保持坚强, stay hungry 保持求知欲. You got this (非正式)你能行. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我们要来看看如果你在 2020 年参加 AP 历史考试，会面临什么。如果你不知道，今年 AP 历史考试将采用修改后的 DBQ 评分标准。一切都完全不同了，最大的不同是你将有 45 分钟的考试时间——45 分钟的写作时间。这将是一道 DBQ 题，你将有五分钟的时间将你的答案上传到大学理事会的平台。所以，一道题将决定你在 AP 历史课上整整一年的表现。

一个好消息是：AP 美国历史的 DBQ 可以涵盖第三至第七个时期。为所有的朋友们倒点苹果汁，第一至第二以及第八至第九个时期将不会出现在今年的 DBQ 中。你需要记住的一个重要数字是十。十是那些穿着苏格兰短裙的帅哥们跳舞时旋转的次数，也是今年你可以在 DBQ 上获得的分数。所以这是一个修改后的评分标准——总共十分。

第一分和往常一样：你的论点或主张得一分。这是指你用一个在历史上站得住脚的论点或主张来回应题目，并确立一个论证思路。所以要获得这一分，你不能只是改述或重复题目——你必须采取立场。这实际上是你论文的优势所在：你打算论证什么？所以获得这一分非常重要。

接下来是背景化。这和以前一样。你需要描述与题目相关的更广泛的历史背景。要获得这一分，它必须将题目的话题与发生在问题时间范围之前、期间或之后更广泛的历史事件、发展或进程联系起来。所以通常我们说把你的背景化放在你论点陈述下面的开头段落中。

你的大部分分数将来自评分标准的证据部分。这里有五分，所以你需要在这一部分获得一些分数。第一分应该很容易拿到。你需要使用至少两份文献的内容来回应题目的话题。所以要获得这一分，你的回答必须准确地描述——而不是简单地引用——至少两份文献的内容。所以只要表明你知道这些文献是关于什么的就行了。你甚至不需要把它与你的论点联系起来。

你可以在这一部分获得的下一分是，你使用两份文献来支持你对题目的回应中的论点。所以对于这一分，你需要拿出两份文献，并使用文献的内容来支持你在你的论点陈述中提出的论点。所以这不仅仅是描述文献，而是将它们用作证据。这一分也应该很容易拿到。所以你需要能够一开始就拿下这两分。

接下来这一分可能有点难拿到。你需要使用至少四份文献来支持你对题目的回应中的论点。所以你必须使用四份文献。DBQ 中只有五份文献——你必须使用其中的四份来推进你的论点。快速数学计算：詹姆斯·K·波尔克会指出，到目前为止，证据部分已经得了三分。那么剩下的两分在哪里呢？这涉及到文献以外的证据。所以你必须在你的大脑中寻找。你必须找到文献中没有的东西。

如果你使用至少一个文献以外的、与关于题目的论点相关的额外历史证据，你可以获得一分。所以你不能只是提出任何随机的历史事实——它必须与你提出的论点相关。如果你描述第二个外部信息——再次强调，是文献以外的——并且它与题目相关，你可以获得另一分。所以我们在证据部分总共有五分。

评分标准的下一部分是分析和推理部分。这里可能获得三分，这也是我们获得 HIPPO 分数或你对文献进行 HIPP 分析的地方——或者如果你的老师像这家伙闪亮的脸一样使用 HAPPY——那就是你获得这些分数的地方。所以，对于一份文献，你解释了文献的观点、目的、历史背景或情境和/或受众如何与一个论点相关，可以获得一分。所以要获得这一分，你的回答必须解释这些不同的东西——观点、目的、历史背景或受众——如何或为什么与一个论点相关。所以你不能只是说观点是这样——你必须把它与你的论点联系起来。

如果你对第二份文献进行相同的过程——HIP 分析或 HAPPY 分析——你可以获得第二分。评分标准的最后一部分是复杂性分。很多老师称之为独角兽分，如果你使用证据来证实、限定或修改一个回答问题的论点，从而展示对题目重点的历史发展的复杂理解，就可以获得这一分。所以这是考察历史的复杂性——细微差别，那种反驳论点。如果你在你的论文中始终如一地做到这一点，就可以获得这一分。但在正常年份很难获得，更不用说像 2020 年这样古怪的年份了。

这是一个非常复杂的过程。大多数学生——大多数老师——在写完或批改完这些东西后都感到精疲力尽。所以你需要坚持下去。你知道，我怎么强调都不为过的一点是，了解你的内容。你可以花一整天看着这个评分标准，试图从数学上弄清楚，预测你会得多少分。但是如果你不了解历史，你就无法提出论点，也无法分析这些来源。所以内容为王。历史思维技能很重要，但了解历史知识才是真正重要的。

如果西奥多·罗斯福中枪后还能带着子弹发表演讲，你也能应付这道 DBQ 题。如果你需要任何帮助，你可以访问 apushexplained.com，那里有各种免费的历史和政府视频。最重要的是，保持专注，保持坚强，保持渴望。你行的。祝你拥有美好的一天。再见！
