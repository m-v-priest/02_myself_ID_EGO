== 释义

What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're doing a deep dive 深入探讨 into the process 过程；步骤 of analyzing 分析；研究 documents and how I recommend 推荐；建议 you should keep track of 记录；追踪 all the seven million different things you need to do in order to 为了；以便 earn points 得分 on the rubric 评分标准. As I walk you through 引导；带领 the different documents, I recommend you hit pause and try the analysis process yourself. And when you're ready -- or you want to wave the white flag (投降) -- go ahead and hit play, and I will walk you through how I might use these documents to answer the prompt 提示；题目 right here.

Some last words before I begin: You will get better at this. You know the old saying "practice makes perfect," but remember, nobody's perfect. What's up with all these mixed messages? Sometimes you will get a prompt or a set of documents that will completely 完全地；彻底地 throw you off 使你困惑；使你不知所措. The key to being successful 成功的 at the DBQ is internalizing 内化；吸收 the process -- knowing all the steps you need to complete 完成；结束 and then executing 执行；实施. So practice, practice, practice. With that being said 说了这么多, let's get it going.

And a quick reminder what the prompt is we are trying to answer, and the different parts of the prompt, and of course 当然 the time period 时期；阶段 we are focusing on 集中于；专注于. Here is our first document. Oh, it's our first document. And like I said, pause and try out 尝试；试验 the process as you read. If it helps, mark up 标记；划出 the text before reading. Check the sourcing 来源. You most likely 很可能；极有可能 know John Smith. The date 1624 does reveal 揭示；表明 this is after 在…之后 the starving time (指早期殖民地因饥饿而死亡的时期) and the colony 殖民地 being a hot mess (非正式)一团糟. And since it's from John Smith, we might get the perspective 视角；观点 from the colonial 殖民地的 elite 精英.

Basically 基本上；主要地, this document is about how difficult 困难的 life was in Virginia. A bunch of 一堆；许多 folks (非正式)人们；各位 died. There's a desire 渴望；期望 for gold 黄金 which consumed 吞噬；占据 many of the settlers 定居者, and John Smith also mentioned some commanders 指挥官 were not exactly 并不完全 great leaders. And of course 当然, goes on to mention 继续提到 his role 角色；作用 in helping out 帮助 the colony. Now while I'm doing all this stuff, I'm going to say this once: You don't need to worry about summarizing 总结；概述 the entire 整个的 document. In fact 事实上；实际上, you will not summarize the document in your actual 实际的；真实的 essay. Chances are 很可能；多半 you won't even write this stuff out in the margins 页边空白. Early on though, it's a good practice to jot 匆匆地记下 a few things about the document as you read it.

So how does this document connect to 与…联系；与…相关 the prompt? And this is what you're actually 实际上；事实上 going to be doing in your essay. What does the document do to help you answer the prompt with a historically defensible claim 历史上站得住脚的论断? And this document does reveal 揭示；表明 the profit motivation 利润动机 for the colonization 殖民 of the Chesapeake region. The settlers came here looking for 寻找；寻求 gold, looking for money, looking for profits. Since this is the first document, we can't really group 分组；分类 it with any other documents, but we do know it reveals the motivation behind 在…背后；…的原因 the settlement 定居；殖民 of the Chesapeake region, so we're going to want to keep that in mind 牢记于心 when looking at other documents.

Now if you look at the rubric 评分标准, you only need a few pieces of outside information to get the outside information point, but it is a good practice to think if there are any additional 额外的；附加的 historical details 历史细节 that could complement 补充；完善 your analysis 分析；研究 of the document and help you support 支持；支撑 your thesis 论文；论点. The document does not explicitly 明确地；清晰地 mention 提到；提及 the starving time, or how John Smith helped the colony get through 经历；度过 some tough times 艰难时期 with his "you don't work, you don't eat" policy 政策；方针, or how tobacco 烟草 really saved the colony by providing 提供；供给 Virginia with a way to make money. If you use this outside information, you can get the point if you use it in a way that directly 直接地 connects to 与…联系；与…相关 your argument 论点；观点 and addresses 处理；应对 the prompt being asked.

Remember, for the extended analysis 扩展分析 portion 部分；环节, you should aim to do any one of the HIPPs (Historical Context 历史背景, Intended Audience 预期读者, Purpose 目的, Point of View 观点) for at least 至少 four different documents. You only need to do it for three documents, but it's better to be safe than sorry (以防万一). One way to get the HIP analysis point would be to analyze 分析；研究 the point of view and/or purpose of the document. Since it's a document from John Smith, it is from the perspective 视角；观点 of one of the leaders of the colony who established 建立；设立 strict 严格的；严厉的 rules 规则；规章 to ensure 确保；保证 the colony's survival 生存；幸存. Smith may have been influenced 影响 by his desire 渴望；期望 to paint himself in a favorable light 给自己脸上贴金 back over in England 英格兰 by writing his account 记述；叙述 of the history 历史 of Virginia. When doing your HIP analysis, you must connect your analysis to its relevance 相关性；关联 to your argument or the prompt. The information about the point of view or purpose of the document would be relevant since it demonstrates 表明；证明 a difference between the profit motives behind 在…背后；…的原因 the founding 建立；创立 of Chesapeake versus 与…相对；与…相比 the founding of the New England colonies.

Next up is Document Two. Pause if you want to read it over 仔细阅读. When looking at it, John Winthrop -- he's one of the founders 创始人 of the New England colonies. He is a Puritan 清教徒, and this document was created before 在…之前 his arrival 到达；到来 to Massachusetts 马萨诸塞州. Before even reading the document, you might ask yourself if this may provide 提供；供给 us a glimpse into 一瞥；初步了解 the motivation behind 在…背后；…的原因 colonization 殖民 of the New England region. In this document, is Winthrop talking about the importance 重要性 of the Massachusetts Bay Colony working together to create a "city upon a hill" (山巅之城，指具有榜样作用的社群) that will serve as an example 榜样；典范 to the rest of the world?

How does it connect to 与…联系；与…相关 the prompt? You know the New England settlements 定居点 were motivated 激励；促使 by religion 宗教, the importance 重要性 of community 社区. And since it was written before 在…之前 his arrival, perhaps 也许；可能 it reflects 反映；显示 some planning for the colony, which seems like a very different experience than what happened over in Jamestown. Now that we have more than one document, we can start thinking about the relationship 关系；关联 between the different documents. Whereas 然而；但是 Document One demonstrated 表明；证明 the motivations behind 在…背后；…的原因 colonization of the Chesapeake, Document Two reveals 揭示；表明 the motivation behind settlement 定居；殖民 of the New England region. Thinking back to 回想 the prompt, this seems to be some solid 扎实的；可靠的 evidence 证据 as to 关于；至于 the difference between the two regions -- namely 即；也就是说, different motivations behind colonization.

Now you don't have to provide 提供；供给 outside information for all the documents or even most of the documents, but once again 再次；又一次 it's good to train your brain to think about what other historical evidence can help your analysis and defense 辩护；维护 of your thesis. You may want to bring in 引入；提及 the town hall meetings (新英格兰地区的)镇议会 in the New England region were intimately 密切地；亲密地 tied to 与…紧密相连 church membership 教会成员资格, and they -- along with 与…一起；连同 things like the Mayflower Compact 《五月花号公约》 -- were the start of early democratic 民主的 institutions 机构；制度 in North America 北美洲.

For this particular 特定的；特别的 document, I want to show you two different types of HIP analysis you could do, but remember you only need to do one for a minimum 最低限度 of three documents. But really try to HIP at least 至少 four because you might make a mistake on one of them. If you were trying to do historical context 历史背景, you could point out 指出；强调 the rise 兴起；出现 of religious dissent 宗教异议 against 反对；对抗 the Anglican Church 英国国教会 in England 英格兰 and the rise of separatist 分裂主义的 communities 社群 such as 例如；比如 the Pilgrims 清教徒 and Puritans 清教徒 led to groups seeking to 寻求；试图 set up 建立；设立 a colony 殖民地 in the New England region. This background is relevant 相关的；切题的 because it speaks to 表明；涉及 the reasons for the motivation of the colonization of the New England region. Or you could examine 检查；审查 the purpose 目的；意图 of the document, which was Winthrop outlining 概述；列出 in vivid detail 生动地；详细地 why this Puritan colony was being created in the New England region. Once again 再次；又一次, make sure you connect your analysis to the relevance 相关性；关联 of your argument and the prompt you have been given.

Document Three: Early sourcing 早期来源 doesn't reveal a whole lot (非正式)不多；没多少. We got a list of people headed for 前往；驶向 New England. The date of 1635 does tell me this is not the first group of people headed to the region, because remember Document Two was dated 1630. So I'm assuming 假设；假定 that by 1635, John Winthrop and his crew (非正式)一伙人；全体人员 have made it to 到达；成功到达 North America, and what we have in Document Three is a list of families coming to the New England region to establish 建立；设立 a permanent 永久的；持久的 settlement 定居点.

This document connects to 与…联系；与…相关 the prompt because it shows a diversity 多样性 of settlers 定居者 who went to the New England region. You have families, a diversity of skills 技能；技巧, professions 职业；行业, ages 年龄, and it demonstrates 表明；证明 they sought to 寻求；试图 establish a permanent religious settlement. The relative 相对的；比较的 even distribution 分布 of men and women will ensure 确保；保证 population growth 人口增长. You might want to ask your parents why this would be the case -- I'm not your health teacher -- and the variety of skills and professions would ensure this colony would be stable 稳定的；稳固的 and a self-sufficient 自给自足的 community 社区.

In terms of 关于；就…而言 organizing 组织；安排 our evidence 证据, Document Three reveals 揭示；表明 not only some additional 额外的；附加的 insight 洞察力；领悟 into the motivation behind 在…背后；…的原因 colonization of the New England region -- you know they have ministers 牧师 on board -- but it also shows us who actually 实际上；事实上 came to the area, and this may be relevant 相关的；切题的. I would probably 可能；大概 skip 跳过；略过 adding additional outside information into my analysis, but if I want to include 包括；包含 something relevant, you can see a possibility right there. And likewise 同样地；类似地, I could skip 跳过；略过 doing an extended analysis with this document, but you can see a way that historical context might be used effectively 有效地 in advancing 推进；促进 your argument 论点；观点 for this prompt.

Next up we got Document Four. This document we have a list of people going to Virginia. Remember Jamestown was founded 建立；创立 in 1607, so these people are arriving to 到达；来到 a colony that had been around for a cool minute (非正式)很长时间. And this list not only demonstrates 表明；证明 that it was largely 主要地 men headed to 前往；驶向 the Chesapeake region, but also there was a lack of diversity 多样性 in skills, genders 性别, ages 年龄 in the region as well. In other words 换句话说；也就是说, in the Chesapeake region... This document is in sharp contrast to 与…形成鲜明对比 Document Three. We see very different people going to the Chesapeake region than there were going to the New England region. And in thinking about the prompt, perhaps 也许；可能 not only motivation for colonization but also the types of colonists 殖民者 who came to each region will help explain 解释；说明 the differences in development 发展；进步 by 1700.

Some outside information which may help in your analysis might be tobacco 烟草 was the cash crop 经济作物 of Virginia that drove 驱使；促使 many settlers to come to the area hoping to acquire 获得；取得 land and wealth 财富. And for these types of documents, I typically 通常；一般地 tell students to avoid an intended audience 预期读者/point of view 观点/purpose 目的 analysis. Typically 通常；一般地 students say super general 非常笼统的 things like "the intended audience was people who wanted to know who was on the ship headed to Virginia in 1635," where "the point of view was from the perspective 视角；观点 of Virginian." There is not enough information about this document to really answer those questions with enough depth 深度 that would get you the point. For this type of document, historical context is always the safer bet 更稳妥的选择. For example 例如；比如, you could elaborate 详细阐述 how this particular 特定的；特别的 document is a list of people headed to Virginia well after 在…之后 the starving time and events such as 例如；比如 Powhatan's War 波瓦坦战争. And if you go on to say 继续说 these men are searching for 寻找；寻求 wealth, oftentimes 经常；往往 arriving as indentured servants 契约奴仆, you would definitely 肯定地；无疑地 be analyzing 分析；研究 the historical context while also showing the relevance 相关性；关联 to the argument 论点；观点 about motives 动机；目的 and the types of colonists who arrived in the Chesapeake region.

Document Five: There's not a whole lot of (非正式)不多；没多少 information to do any meaningful 有意义的 initial 初期的；最初的 sourcing 来源, but the document is a map of the New England region. It shows a town hall 市政厅, has a school 学校, family farms 家庭农场, a church 教堂. And since we saw in Document Two and Three the New England colonies were colonized 殖民 for religious reasons by people with diverse 多样的 skills, professions, ages, etc., it would make sense 合乎情理；有道理 that they would settle 定居 in a tight-knit 紧密的；团结的 community 社区 like we see in Document Five. Schools would be important part of the community so colonists 殖民者 could be literate 有读写能力的 so they could read the Bible 《圣经》. We already 已经 know how much they love their churches in the New England region.

As for 关于；至于 outside information, you could bring in 引入；提及 how Harvard 哈佛大学 was the first university 大学 in North America and was founded 建立；创立 in the New England region to train ministers 牧师. This could tie in nicely 很好地联系起来 once again 再次；又一次 to the motivations behind 在…背后；…的原因 settlement 定居；殖民 and the development 发展；进步 of the New England region. And this is another type of document I would stick to 坚持；固守 historical context if I was to use it as one of the documents for the extended analysis. There's simply 简直；仅仅 not enough information about the document to properly 正确地；恰当地 address 处理；应对 intended audience, point of view, or purpose.

And finally 最后；终于, our last document -- Document Six. This is a document from Nathaniel Bacon, leader 领导者 of Bacon's Rebellion 培根叛乱. In it, we see Bacon condemning 谴责 the wealth 财富 in the hands of a few and the protection 保护 of Native people 本地居民；原住民 by the colonial elite. This is a great document to examine 检查；审查 how the two areas developed into two distinct 截然不同的；有明显区别的 regions 地区. Document Six shows class resentment 阶级怨恨 in colonial 殖民地的 Virginia against 反对；对抗 the planter class 种植园主阶级 and anger over a lack of 缺乏；不足 land and protections 保护 against 反对；对抗 Native people. It connects to 与…联系；与…相关 motive 动机；目的 and types of people who came to the region. And this document contrasts with 与…形成对比 the development 发展；进步 of community we see in the New England region as seen in Document Five, and reinforces 加强；巩固 the views 观点；看法 in Document One of individual pursuit 追求；寻求 of profit 利润；收益 driving 驱动；推动 colonial development in the Chesapeake region.

Now a quick word of warning 警告: You might be tempted to 想要；很想 get into a whole paragraph about Bacon's Rebellion -- all the details 细节 about the causes 原因；起因, what went down (非正式)发生；进行 during it, and of course 当然 the outcome 结果；后果. But remember, outside information should only be used as it is relevant 相关的；切题的 to the prompt in advancing 推进；促进 your thesis 论文；论点. Do not turn this into an essay about any one document. You could bring in 引入；提及 the fact that indentured servants 契约奴仆 were the primary 主要的；首要的 labor 劳动力 source 来源 in colonial 殖民地的 Virginia which will lead to 导致；引起 the development 发展；形成 of class division 阶级分化. You can even bring in 引入；提及 how the growth 增长；发展 of African slavery 非洲奴隶制 will increase 增加；提高 following 在…之后 Bacon's Rebellion, which will also make it distinct 明显的；独特的 from the New England region.

And there are a lot of different ways you could successfully 成功地 integrate 整合；融入 your HIP analysis into your response 回应；回答. On the right, you could see a few examples how you might go about doing sth 如何着手做… this. So that's pretty much 几乎；差不多 how I recommend 推荐；建议 you look at the documents, especially 特别是；尤其 early on when you're just getting started with 开始使用 the DBQ. In our next video, we're going to actually 实际上；事实上 write the essay. I'm going to show you what this whole thing will look like once it comes together 结合在一起；形成整体 in an essay that'll get you all the APUSH (Advanced Placement United States History) street cred (非正式)街头信誉；名声 in the world -- and more importantly 更重要的是, we'll get you that college credit 大学学分. Thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，漂亮的人们！欢迎来到乔氏制作。今天我们要深入探讨分析文献的过程，以及我建议你如何记录所有七百万件不同的事情，以便在评分标准上获得分数。当我带你浏览不同的文献时，我建议你暂停并尝试自己进行分析。当你准备好——或者你想投降——就继续播放，我将向你展示我如何使用这些文献来回答这里的问题。

在开始之前的一些最后的话：你会越来越擅长这件事的。你知道那句老话“熟能生巧”，但记住，没有人是完美的。所有这些混杂的信息是怎么回事？有时你会遇到一个题目或一组文献，它们会彻底把你搞糊涂。成功完成 DBQ 的关键在于内化这个过程——知道你需要完成的所有步骤，然后执行。所以练习，练习，再练习。话虽如此，让我们开始吧。

快速提醒一下我们试图回答的问题，问题的不同部分，当然还有我们关注的时间段。这是我们的第一份文献。哦，这是我们的第一份文献。就像我说过的，阅读时暂停并尝试这个过程。如果它有帮助，在阅读之前标记文本。检查来源。你很可能认识约翰·史密斯。1624 年的日期表明这是在饥饿时期和殖民地一片混乱之后。由于它来自约翰·史密斯，我们可能会得到殖民精英的视角。

基本上，这份文献是关于在弗吉尼亚的生活有多么艰难。很多人死了。对黄金的渴望吞噬了许多定居者，约翰·史密斯还提到一些指挥官并不是真正的伟大领导者。当然，他还继续提到他在帮助殖民地方面的作用。现在，当我做所有这些事情时，我会说一次：你不需要担心总结整份文献。事实上，你不会在你的实际论文中总结文献。你很可能甚至不会在页边空白处写下这些东西。但是，在早期，在阅读时记下一些关于文献的东西是一个好的做法。

那么这份文献如何与题目相关联呢？这才是你真正要在论文中做的事情。这份文献如何帮助你用一个在历史上站得住脚的观点来回答题目？这份文献确实揭示了切萨皮克地区殖民化的利润动机。定居者来到这里是为了寻找黄金，寻找金钱，寻找利润。由于这是第一份文献，我们还不能真正将它与其他任何文献归为一组，但我们知道它揭示了切萨皮克地区定居背后的动机，所以我们在查看其他文献时需要记住这一点。

现在如果你看一下评分标准，你只需要一些外部信息就可以获得外部信息的分数，但思考是否有任何额外的历史细节可以补充你对文献的分析并帮助你支持你的论点是一个好的做法。这份文献没有明确提到饥饿时期，或者约翰·史密斯如何通过他的“不劳动者不得食”的政策帮助殖民地度过艰难时期，或者烟草如何通过为弗吉尼亚提供赚钱的方式真正拯救了殖民地。如果你使用这些外部信息，如果你以直接与你的论点相关并回应所提出的问题的方式使用它，你可以获得分数。

记住，对于扩展分析部分，你应该争取对至少四份不同的文献进行任何一种 HIPPO 分析。你只需要对三份文献进行分析，但宁可谨慎也不要后悔。获得 HIP 分析分数的一种方法是分析文献的观点和/或目的。由于这份文献来自约翰·史密斯，它是来自殖民地领导人之一的视角，他制定了严格的规则以确保殖民地的生存。史密斯可能受到他在英国写下弗吉尼亚历史的叙述，希望给自己留下好印象的愿望的影响。在进行 HIP 分析时，你必须将你的分析与其对你的论点或题目的相关性联系起来。关于文献的观点或目的的信息是相关的，因为它展示了切萨皮克殖民地建立背后的利润动机与新英格兰殖民地建立背后的动机之间的差异。

接下来是文献二。如果你想仔细阅读，请暂停。查看时，约翰·温斯罗普——他是新英格兰殖民地的创始人之一。他是一位清教徒，这份文献是在他抵达马萨诸塞州之前创作的。甚至在阅读文献之前，你可能会问自己，这是否能让我们了解新英格兰地区殖民化背后的动机。在这份文献中，温斯罗普是否在谈论马萨诸塞湾殖民地共同努力创建一个将成为世界其他地方榜样的“山巅之城”的重要性？

它如何与题目相关联？你知道新英格兰的定居点是由宗教、社区的重要性所驱动的。由于它是在他抵达之前写的，也许它反映了殖民地的一些规划，这似乎与詹姆斯敦发生的事情非常不同。既然我们有多份文献，我们可以开始思考不同文献之间的关系。文献一展示了切萨皮克殖民化背后的动机，文献二揭示了新英格兰地区定居背后的动机。回想一下题目，这似乎是关于这两个地区之间差异的一些确凿证据——即殖民化背后不同的动机。

现在你不必为所有文献甚至大多数文献提供外部信息，但再次强调，训练你的大脑思考哪些其他历史证据可以帮助你分析和捍卫你的论点是一个好习惯。你可能想提及新英格兰地区的镇议会会议与教会成员密切相关，它们——以及像《五月花号公约》这样的东西——是北美早期民主制度的开端。

对于这份特定的文献，我想向你展示两种不同类型的 HIP 分析，你可以做其中一种，但记住你只需要对至少三份文献做一种。但最好尝试对至少四份文献进行 HIP 分析，因为你可能会在一个分析中犯错。如果你试图进行历史背景分析，你可以指出英国国内反对英国国教的宗教异议的兴起，以及像朝圣者和清教徒这样的分离主义社区的兴起，导致一些团体寻求在新英格兰地区建立殖民地。这个背景是相关的，因为它说明了新英格兰地区殖民化动机的原因。或者你可以考察文献的目的，温斯罗普在文献中生动地概述了为什么在新英格兰地区建立这个清教徒殖民地。再次强调，确保你将你的分析与你的论点和所给题目的相关性联系起来。

文献三：早期的来源信息并没有揭示太多。我们有一份前往新英格兰的人员名单。1635 年的日期告诉我这不是第一批前往该地区的人，因为记住文献二的日期是 1630 年。所以我假设到 1635 年，约翰·温斯罗普和他的团队已经到达北美，而文献三是我们看到的一份前往新英格兰地区建立永久定居点的家庭名单。

这份文献与题目相关联，因为它展示了前往新英格兰地区的定居者的多样性。你有家庭，各种技能、职业、年龄，这表明他们寻求建立一个永久的宗教定居点。男女相对均匀的分布将确保人口增长。你可能想问你的父母为什么会这样——我不是你的健康老师——各种技能和职业将确保这个殖民地将是稳定和自给自足的社区。

就组织我们的证据而言，文献三不仅揭示了新英格兰地区殖民化背后动机的一些额外见解——你知道他们有牧师在船上——而且还向我们展示了实际来到该地区的人，这可能是相关的。我可能不会在我的分析中添加额外的外部信息，但如果我想包括一些相关信息，你可以在那里看到一种可能性。同样，我可以跳过对这份文献进行扩展分析，但你可以看到历史背景可以有效地用于推进你对这个题目的论点的一种方式。

接下来我们有文献四。这份文献是我们看到的一份前往弗吉尼亚的人员名单。记住詹姆斯敦成立于 1607 年，所以这些人到达的是一个已经存在了一段时间的殖民地。这份名单不仅表明前往切萨皮克地区的主要是男性，而且该地区在技能、性别、年龄方面也缺乏多样性。换句话说，在切萨皮克地区……这份文献与文献三形成了鲜明的对比。我们看到前往切萨皮克地区的人与前往新英格兰地区的人非常不同。在思考题目时，也许不仅是殖民化的动机，而且是来到每个地区的殖民者的类型将有助于解释到 1700 年的发展差异。

一些可能有助于你分析的外部信息可能是烟草是弗吉尼亚的经济作物，它驱使许多定居者来到该地区，希望获得土地和财富。对于这类文献，我通常告诉学生避免进行预期受众/观点/目的分析。通常学生会说一些非常笼统的话，比如“预期受众是那些想知道 1635 年前往弗吉尼亚的船上有谁的人”，而“观点是来自弗吉尼亚人的视角”。关于这份文献的信息不足以真正深入地回答这些问题，从而获得分数。对于这类文献，历史背景始终是更安全的选择。例如，你可以详细说明这份特定的文献是在饥饿时期和波瓦坦战争等事件很久之后前往弗吉尼亚的人员名单。如果你继续说这些人正在寻找财富，经常作为契约奴隶抵达，你肯定会在分析历史背景的同时，也展示其与关于切萨皮克地区殖民动机和抵达殖民者类型的论点的相关性。

文献五：没有太多信息可以进行任何有意义的初步来源分析，但这份文献是新英格兰地区的地图。它显示了一个镇议会、一所学校、家庭农场和一座教堂。既然我们在文献二和三中看到，新英格兰殖民地是由具有各种技能、职业、年龄等的人出于宗教原因殖民的，那么他们会像我们在文献五中看到的那样，定居在一个紧密的社区中是有道理的。学校将是社区的重要组成部分，这样殖民者才能识字，以便他们能够阅读圣经。我们已经知道他们在多大程度上热爱新英格兰地区的教堂。

至于外部信息，你可以提及哈佛是北美第一所大学，它在新英格兰地区成立是为了培养牧师。这可以再次很好地与定居背后的动机和新英格兰地区的发展联系起来。如果我要将这种类型的文献作为扩展分析的文献之一，我也会坚持历史背景。关于这份文献的信息实在不足以恰当地探讨预期受众、观点或目的。

最后，我们的最后一份文献——文献六。这是来自培根叛乱领导人纳撒尼尔·培根的一份文献。在其中，我们看到培根谴责少数人手中的财富以及殖民精英对当地人民的保护。这是一份很好的文献，可以考察这两个地区是如何发展成为两个截然不同的地区。文献六显示了殖民地弗吉尼亚对种植园主阶级的阶级怨恨，以及对缺乏土地和对当地人民缺乏保护的愤怒。它与来到该地区的动机和人民类型有关。这份文献与我们在文献五中看到的新英格兰地区社区的发展形成对比，并强化了文献一中个人追求利润驱动切萨皮克地区殖民发展的观点。

现在关于外部信息的一个快速警告：你可能会想用一整段来讲述培根叛乱——所有关于起因、过程中发生的事情，当然还有结果的细节。但记住，外部信息只应在与推进你的论点的题目相关时使用。不要把它变成一篇关于任何一份文献的论文。你可以提及契约奴隶是殖民地弗吉尼亚的主要劳动力来源，这将导致阶级分化的发展。你甚至可以提及在培根叛乱之后非洲奴隶制的增长将如何使其与新英格兰地区不同。

有很多不同的方法可以成功地将你的 HIP 分析融入你的回答中。在右侧，你可以看到一些关于如何进行此操作的示例。这基本上就是我建议你如何看待文献，尤其是在你刚开始接触 DBQ 的早期阶段。在我们的下一个视频中，我们将实际撰写论文。我将向你展示一旦它在一篇能让你获得全世界 APUSH 声誉——更重要的是，我们将让你获得大学学分的论文中结合起来，整个过程会是什么样子。非常感谢您的观看。祝您拥有美好的一天。再见！

What's up, beautiful people? Welcome to Joe's Productions. Today we're doing a deep dive into the process of analyzing documents and how I recommend you should keep track of all the seven million different things you need to do in order to earn points on the rubric. As I walk you through the different documents, I recommend you hit pause and try the analysis process yourself. And when you're ready -- or you want to wave the white flag -- go ahead and hit play, and I will walk you through how I might use these documents to answer the prompt right here.

Some last words before I begin: You will get better at this. You know the old saying "practice makes perfect," but remember, nobody's perfect. What's up with all these mixed messages? Sometimes you will get a prompt or a set of documents that will completely throw you off. The key to being successful at the DBQ is internalizing the process -- knowing all the steps you need to complete and then executing. So practice, practice, practice. With that being said, let's get it going.

And a quick reminder what the prompt is we are trying to answer, and the different parts of the prompt, and of course the time period we are focusing on. Here is our first document. Oh, it's our first document. And like I said, pause and try out the process as you read. If it helps, mark up the text before reading. Check the sourcing. You most likely know John Smith. The date 1624 does reveal this is after the starving time and the colony being a hot mess. And since it's from John Smith, we might get the perspective from the colonial elite.

Basically, this document is about how difficult life was in Virginia. A bunch of folks died. There's a desire for gold which consumed many of the settlers, and John Smith also mentioned some commanders were not exactly great leaders. And of course, goes on to mention his role in helping out the colony. Now while I'm doing all this stuff, I'm going to say this once: You don't need to worry about summarizing the entire document. In fact, you will not summarize the document in your actual essay. Chances are you won't even write this stuff out in the margins. Early on though, it's a good practice to jot a few things about the document as you read it.

So how does this document connect to the prompt? And this is what you're actually going to be doing in your essay. What does the document do to help you answer the prompt with a historically defensible claim? And this document does reveal the profit motivation for the colonization of the Chesapeake region. The settlers came here looking for gold, looking for money, looking for profits. Since this is the first document, we can't really group it with any other documents, but we do know it reveals the motivation behind the settlement of the Chesapeake region, so we're going to want to keep that in mind when looking at other documents.

Now if you look at the rubric, you only need a few pieces of outside information to get the outside information point, but it is a good practice to think if there are any additional historical details that could complement your analysis of the document and help you support your thesis. The document does not explicitly mention the starving time, or how John Smith helped the colony get through some tough times with his "you don't work, you don't eat" policy, or how tobacco really saved the colony by providing Virginia with a way to make money. If you use this outside information, you can get the point if you use it in a way that directly connects to your argument and addresses the prompt being asked.

Remember, for the extended analysis portion, you should aim to do any one of the HIPPs for at least four different documents. You only need to do it for three documents, but it's better to be safe than sorry. One way to get the HIP analysis point would be to analyze the point of view and/or purpose of the document. Since it's a document from John Smith, it is from the perspective of one of the leaders of the colony who established strict rules to ensure the colony's survival. Smith may have been influenced by his desire to paint himself in a favorable light back over in England by writing his account of the history of Virginia. When doing your HIP analysis, you must connect your analysis to its relevance to your argument or the prompt. The information about the point of view or purpose of the document would be relevant since it demonstrates a difference between the profit motives behind the founding of Chesapeake versus the founding of the New England colonies.

Next up is Document Two. Pause if you want to read it over. When looking at it, John Winthrop -- he's one of the founders of the New England colonies. He is a Puritan, and this document was created before his arrival to Massachusetts. Before even reading the document, you might ask yourself if this may provide us a glimpse into the motivation behind colonization of the New England region. In this document, is Winthrop talking about the importance of the Massachusetts Bay Colony working together to create a "city upon a hill" that will serve as an example to the rest of the world?

How does it connect to the prompt? You know the New England settlements were motivated by religion, the importance of community. And since it was written before his arrival, perhaps it reflects some planning for the colony, which seems like a very different experience than what happened over in Jamestown. Now that we have more than one document, we can start thinking about the relationship between the different documents. Whereas Document One demonstrated the motivations behind colonization of the Chesapeake, Document Two reveals the motivation behind settlement of the New England region. Thinking back to the prompt, this seems to be some solid evidence as to the difference between the two regions -- namely, different motivations behind colonization.

Now you don't have to provide outside information for all the documents or even most of the documents, but once again it's good to train your brain to think about what other historical evidence can help your analysis and defense of your thesis. You may want to bring in the town hall meetings in the New England region were intimately tied to church membership, and they -- along with things like the Mayflower Compact -- were the start of early democratic institutions in North America.

For this particular document, I want to show you two different types of HIP analysis you could do, but remember you only need to do one for a minimum of three documents. But really try to HIP at least four because you might make a mistake on one of them. If you were trying to do historical context, you could point out the rise of religious dissent against the Anglican Church in England and the rise of separatist communities such as the Pilgrims and Puritans led to groups seeking to set up a colony in the New England region. This background is relevant because it speaks to the reasons for the motivation of the colonization of the New England region. Or you could examine the purpose of the document, which was Winthrop outlining in vivid detail why this Puritan colony was being created in the New England region. Once again, make sure you connect your analysis to the relevance of your argument and the prompt you have been given.

Document Three: Early sourcing doesn't reveal a whole lot. We got a list of people headed for New England. The date of 1635 does tell me this is not the first group of people headed to the region, because remember Document Two was dated 1630. So I'm assuming that by 1635, John Winthrop and his crew have made it to North America, and what we have in Document Three is a list of families coming to the New England region to establish a permanent settlement.

This document connects to the prompt because it shows a diversity of settlers who went to the New England region. You have families, a diversity of skills, professions, ages, and it demonstrates they sought to establish a permanent religious settlement. The relative even distribution of men and women will ensure population growth. You might want to ask your parents why this would be the case -- I'm not your health teacher -- and the variety of skills and professions would ensure this colony would be stable and a self-sufficient community.

In terms of organizing our evidence, Document Three reveals not only some additional insight into the motivation behind colonization of the New England region -- you know they have ministers on board -- but it also shows us who actually came to the area, and this may be relevant. I would probably skip adding additional outside information into my analysis, but if I want to include something relevant, you can see a possibility right there. And likewise, I could skip doing an extended analysis with this document, but you can see a way that historical context might be used effectively in advancing your argument for this prompt.

Next up we got Document Four. This document we have a list of people going to Virginia. Remember Jamestown was founded in 1607, so these people are arriving to a colony that had been around for a cool minute. And this list not only demonstrates that it was largely men headed to the Chesapeake region, but also there was a lack of diversity in skills, genders, ages in the region as well. In other words, in the Chesapeake region... This document is in sharp contrast to Document Three. We see very different people going to the Chesapeake region than there were going to the New England region. And in thinking about the prompt, perhaps not only motivation for colonization but also the types of colonists who came to each region will help explain the differences in development by 1700.

Some outside information which may help in your analysis might be tobacco was the cash crop of Virginia that drove many settlers to come to the area hoping to acquire land and wealth. And for these types of documents, I typically tell students to avoid an intended audience/point of view/purpose analysis. Typically students say super general things like "the intended audience was people who wanted to know who was on the ship headed to Virginia in 1635," where "the point of view was from the perspective of Virginian." There is not enough information about this document to really answer those questions with enough depth that would get you the point. For this type of document, historical context is always the safer bet. For example, you could elaborate how this particular document is a list of people headed to Virginia well after the starving time and events such as Powhatan's War. And if you go on to say these men are searching for wealth, oftentimes arriving as indentured servants, you would definitely be analyzing the historical context while also showing the relevance to the argument about motives and the types of colonists who arrived in the Chesapeake region.

Document Five: There's not a whole lot of information to do any meaningful initial sourcing, but the document is a map of the New England region. It shows a town hall, has a school, family farms, a church. And since we saw in Document Two and Three the New England colonies were colonized for religious reasons by people with diverse skills, professions, ages, etc., it would make sense that they would settle in a tight-knit community like we see in Document Five. Schools would be important part of the community so colonists could be literate so they could read the Bible. We already know how much they love their churches in the New England region.

As for outside information, you could bring in how Harvard was the first university in North America and was founded in the New England region to train ministers. This could tie in nicely once again to the motivations behind settlement and the development of the New England region. And this is another type of document I would stick to historical context if I was to use it as one of the documents for the extended analysis. There's simply not enough information about the document to properly address intended audience, point of view, or purpose.

And finally, our last document -- Document Six. This is a document from Nathaniel Bacon, leader of Bacon's Rebellion. In it, we see Bacon condemning the wealth in the hands of a few and the protection of Native people by the colonial elite. This is a great document to examine how the two areas developed into two distinct regions. Document Six shows class resentment in colonial Virginia against the planter class and anger over a lack of land and protections against Native people. It connects to motive and types of people who came to the region. And this document contrasts with the development of community we see in the New England region as seen in Document Five, and reinforces the views in Document One of individual pursuit of profit driving colonial development in the Chesapeake region.

Now a quick word of warning about outside information: You might be tempted to get into a whole paragraph about Bacon's Rebellion -- all the details about the causes, what went down during it, and of course the outcome. But remember, outside information should only be used as it is relevant to the prompt in advancing your thesis. Do not turn this into an essay about any one document. You could bring in the fact that indentured servants were the primary labor source in colonial Virginia which will lead to the development of class division. You can even bring in how the growth of African slavery will increase following Bacon's Rebellion, which will also make it distinct from the New England region.

And there are a lot of different ways you could successfully integrate your HIP analysis into your response. On the right, you could see a few examples how you might go about doing this. So that's pretty much how I recommend you look at the documents, especially early on when you're just getting started with the DBQ. In our next video, we're going to actually write the essay. I'm going to show you what this whole thing will look like once it comes together in an essay that'll get you all the APUSH street cred in the world -- and more importantly, we'll get you that college credit. Thank you so much for watching. Have a beautiful day. Peace!
