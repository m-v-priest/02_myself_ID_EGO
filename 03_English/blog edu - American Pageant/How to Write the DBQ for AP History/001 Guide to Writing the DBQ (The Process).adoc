== 释义

What's up, beautiful people? Today we're going to be taking a look at 审视；考察 the steps 步骤；措施 to writing the DBQ (Document-Based Question) essay. And I'm not going to lie to you -- this process is pretty brutal 残酷的；野蛮的. But I've been doing this since 2004, and my students have been pretty successful 成功的. It is my hope that when you are done writing your essay and when your teacher is done reading it, the first thing they're going to say is: "It's amazing! So amazing!"

Now remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the journey of writing a DBQ begins with step one, which is to read and analyze 分析；研究 the prompt 提示；题目. So this is the sample prompt that we are going to be working with, and I encourage 鼓励；劝告 you to pause and go ahead and read it. But the important thing is as you read the prompt, you should annotate 注释；评注 the different parts of the question in the margins 页边空白. Break down 分解；拆分 the question: What is the prompt asking you to do? Are there multiple 多个；许多 parts to the question? And in this question, we need to describe 描述；描写 and explain 解释；说明 similarities 相似性；类似点 and/or differences 不同点；差异 between the New England and the Chesapeake regions 地区, and we also need to analyze 分析；研究 why by 1700 these two regions evolved into 演变成；发展成 two distinct 截然不同的；有明显区别的 societies 社会.

You also want to identify 识别；认出 what historical 历史的 thinking skill 技能；技巧 is being assessed 评估；评定. In this case, we have a comparison 比较 question, and you will only be able to craft 精心制作；创造 a clear thesis statement 论点陈述 that answers all parts of the question if you understand the prompt in its entirety 完全地；完整地. You always want to make note of 注意；留意 the time frame 时间范围 the question gives you. You will only get points for providing historical evidence 历史证据 within 在…之内；在…内部 the time frame of the prompt. In this case, the prompt specifically 特别地；明确地 mentions 提到；提及 "by 1700," so nothing that happened after 1700 will be relevant 相关的；切题的 to earning you points on the rubric 评分标准. Usually 通常；一般地, they will give you a time frame for the question. This prompt does not, but since the first permanent 永久的；持久的 British settlement 定居点 was established 建立；设立 in 1607, it is safe to say 可以肯定地说 your response 回应；回答 should be largely 主要地 focused on 集中于；专注于 the time period 时期；阶段 1607 to 1700.

Step two is quick brainstorming 集体讨论；头脑风暴 time. Now the documents are hopefully 有希望地；但愿 going to help you answer the question, but before you look at the documents, start thinking about how you might go about doing sth 如何着手做… answering this question without any documents. After a very short brainstorm -- say less than two minutes -- you might have a list like this in the margins. So perhaps 也许；可能 you remember the New England region is Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Puritans 清教徒 came there, there was a Massachusetts Bay Company. The Chesapeake was Virginia and Maryland, Jamestown -- first British settlement, there was a starving time (指早期殖民地因饥饿而死亡的时期). If possible, try to organize 组织；安排 your thoughts around different parts of the question. Think about: What are some things you know about New England colonies 殖民地? What are some things you know about the Chesapeake region? In this case, do you know any similarities? Differences? And finally, reasons they evolved into two distinct societies.

So you know some similarities -- maybe the only thing you can come up with 想出；提出 is both regions had guys named John -- John Winthrop and John Smith. And when brainstorming some differences, maybe you actually remember the Chesapeake had cash crops 经济作物, maybe there was like tobacco 烟草, whereas 然而；但是 in New England it was like religion 宗教 and stuff 东西；事物, but you're not entirely 完全地；全然地 sure of much else. The more organized you can make your brainstorming notes, the better off you are going to be. Now you will definitely 肯定地；无疑地 come back to this brainstorm list after analyzing the documents, and inevitably 不可避免地；必然地 you will make a lot of revisions 修改；修订 and have some stuff to add to it, but it's good to kind of do a quick brain dump (非正式)倾诉；发泄: What do you know about the topic? Like I said, one to two minutes max.

The reason this is important is by quickly brainstorming, you will more than likely 极有可能；很可能 come up with 想出；提出 some outside information and historical examples 历史例子 that you can use to get some points. For instance 例如；比如, some of the info from the brainstorming session 讨论会 could be used to help you develop 发展；形成 your contextualization 背景化；语境化 that you will eventually 最终；终于 start your essay off with. Now we're going to go more into contextualization in another video, but basically 基本上；主要地 things like: The British colonies started in 1607 with Jamestown. The New England colonies were founded 建立；创立 by Puritans. Colonization 殖民 would be difficult. There was joint stock companies 股份公司. This is the beginning of a really solid 扎实的；可靠的 contextualization that could get you a point, and you haven't even touched a document yet. And other parts of your brainstorm may help answer part of the question by providing 提供；供给 you a historically defensible claim 历史上站得住脚的论断 to talk about differences between the two regions and a possible reason for the difference. So you've already kind of come up with that one had cash crops, the other one was more of a religious-based colony. There was a mixed economy 混合经济 maybe you remember, and the motives 动机；目的 of those coming to the different regions -- the New England colonies religious freedom whereas 然而；但是 Puritans were coming there, whereas the Chesapeake was largely 主要地 based upon profits 利润；收益. This could all kind of start to take shape 形成；成形 early on before, once again 再次；又一次, looking at documents.

Next is perhaps 也许；可能 the hardest part: Step three -- interpret 解释；说明 and analyze 分析；研究 the documents in like 15 minutes. As you are doing this, you're going to want to view each document with these questions in mind. The first question you want to think about is: What is the document about? Could you summarize 总结；概述 the big idea in one sentence? Now your essay is not about summarizing the documents, but understanding 理解；明白 the main point 主要观点 of a document is important and will set you up for doing this: How does the document connect to 与…联系；与…相关 the prompt? How would you use your analysis of the document to answer the prompt and to support 支持；支撑 your thesis 论文；论点 or your argument 论点；观点? This is what you should be doing with the documents. You are not describing 描述；描写 what the document is about, but how the document helps defend 辩护；维护 your thesis.

Next question: Can you group 分组；分类 or categorize 分类；归类 the evidence 证据 found in the document? Does the document connect or make a similar historically defensible claim as another document? If two documents make the same point about a difference between the Chesapeake and the New England colonies, you're going to want to use them in the same body paragraph 主体段落. Part of your analysis of the documents is understanding 理解；明白 the relationship 关系；关联 between different pieces of historical evidence. If you can group similar documents together with that in mind, a document may offer contradictory 矛盾的；对立的 evidence -- evidence that could be used to qualify 限定；使…具有资格 or modify 修改；更改 an argument -- and if that's the case, you're going to want to group that type of evidence together as well.

As you read the document, does it trigger 触发；引起 any additional 额外的；附加的 outside information -- information not found in the document? If so, note that in the margins as well. And finally, is this document good for the extended analysis 扩展分析 portion 部分；环节 of the essay? And we're going to cover 覆盖；涉及 that in a lot of detail 细节 in our next video.

Now if you were like me when I first started learning about the DBQ, I thought this was crazy 疯狂的；难以置信的. That's a whole lot of 许多；大量的 things to keep in mind 牢记于心 when looking at a bunch of 一堆；许多 different documents that you probably 可能；大概 never seen before on a prompt that you've never seen before that you couldn't prepare for. Look, I went to UCLA twice, majoring in 主修 history 历史, graduated with some Latin words on my diploma 毕业证书, and I never had to do something this complicated 复杂的；难懂的 in any of my classes. So let me show you what this might look like in real life.

I think it's really important you come up with 想出；提出 some kind of plan for organizing 组织；安排 your thoughts when you are analyzing the documents. This template 模板；范本 I'm about to show you is what my students use, and they've been doing pretty well with it. And if you can get into the habit of 养成…的习惯 putting your annotations in the same spot, it will help you organize your thoughts, and when it's time to write your essay, you should be in a better position to get the points and to get out of this thing alive.

So early on when writing a DBQ, this is how my students organize their thoughts. First, quickly source 标明来源 the document: Who wrote it? When was it written? This might trigger 触发；引起 some ideas. Jot 匆匆地记下 anything useful 有用的 down right above 在…上方 the document. As you read the document, annotate it -- mark it up 标记. While on the actual 实际的；真实的 essay you might not write too many notes in the margins, it's a good idea in the beginning to train yourself to organize your thoughts. On the left side of the document, I tell my students to jot a few words as to 关于；至于 what the document is about. This is the most important part: How can the document help answer the prompt? Think about: Does this document help you come up with 想出；提出 the historically defensible claim that can become a part of your thesis statement? Put this down on the left side as well.

And as you go through 仔细检查；经历 the documents, you're going to want to group 分组；分类 similar documents or documents that can defend 辩护；维护 a similar historical claim. Likewise 同样地；类似地, a document may contradict 否定；反驳 another document, and you will want to acknowledge 承认；确认 that complexity 复杂性 in your essay and make note of 注意；留意 it also on the left-hand side. When reading the document, you might remember historical information that is not explicitly 明确地；清晰地 mentioned 提到；提及 in the document. This can potentially 潜在地；可能地 become outside information to get you some points, and I tell my students to jot any outside information down right on the right-hand side as well.

And finally 最后；终于, you're gonna need to do an extended analysis 扩展分析 of at least 至少 three documents. I use the acronym 缩略词 HIPPO in my classes. Whichever 无论哪个；任何一个 one you use doesn't really matter. I have my students put their extended analysis annotations on the bottom right of the document as they get used to doing all the different parts of the rubric into timed essay format.

So these are the three steps you should really do before you start writing your essay. In our next video, which you can find the link in the description 描述, I'm going to walk you through 引导；带领 all the different things you're going to need to do with the documents, how you're going to HIP them, outside information, how do you use them to advance 推进；促进 a thesis. So that one's going to be really important, and like I said, the link is in the description.

By the end of this video series 系列, it is my hope that you will feel more comfortable writing the APUSH (Advanced Placement United States History) DBQ. This is just the first step in the process -- knowing how to tackle 处理；对付 each phase 阶段；时期 of the writing.

大家好，漂亮的人们！今天我们要来看一下撰写 DBQ 论文的步骤。我不会骗你——这个过程非常残酷。但我从 2004 年就开始做这件事了，我的学生们都相当成功。我希望当你完成论文写作，你的老师也读完之后，他们说的第一句话会是：“太棒了！简直太棒了！”

记住，千里之行始于足下，而撰写 DBQ 的旅程始于第一步，即阅读和分析题目。这是我们将要使用的示例题目，我建议你暂停并仔细阅读。但重要的是，在阅读题目时，你应该在页边空白处注释问题的不同部分。分解问题：题目要求你做什么？问题是否有多个部分？在这个问题中，我们需要描述和解释"新英格兰地区"和"切萨皮克地区"之间的相似之处和/或不同之处，并且我们还需要分析到 1700 年这两个地区演变成两个截然不同的社会的原因。

你还需要确定所考察的历史思维技能是什么。在本例中，我们有一个比较问题，只有当你完全理解题目时，你才能构建一个清晰的、回答问题所有部分的论点陈述。**你总是需要注意题目给出的时间范围。只有在题目时间范围内的历史证据, 才能为你赢得评分标准上的分数。**在本例中，**题目明确提到了“到 1700 年”，因此 1700 年之后发生的任何事情, 都与你在评分标准上得分无关。**通常，他们会给你一个问题的时间范围。这个题目没有给出明确的时间范围，但由于第一个永久性英国定居点建立于 1607 年，因此可以肯定地说，你的回答应该主要集中在 1607 年到 1700 年这段时间。

第二步是"快速头脑风暴"时间。希望这些文献能够帮助你回答问题，但**在查看文献之前，先思考一下如果没有这些文献，你将如何回答这个问题。**经过非常短暂的头脑风暴——比如少于两分钟——你可能会在页边空白处得到这样一个列表。也许你记得新英格兰地区是马萨诸塞州、罗德岛州，清教徒来到那里，有一个马萨诸塞湾公司。切萨皮克地区是弗吉尼亚州和马里兰州，詹姆斯敦——第一个英国定居点，那里经历过饥饿时期。如果可能，**尝试围绕问题的不同部分组织你的想法。**思考：你对新英格兰殖民地有哪些了解？你对切萨皮克地区有哪些了解？在本例中，你知道任何相似之处吗？不同之处呢？最后，它们演变成两个截然不同的社会的原因是什么？

你知道一些相似之处——也许你唯一能想到的, 是这两个地区都有名叫约翰的人——约翰·温斯罗普, 和约翰·史密斯。在头脑风暴一些不同之处时，也许你实际上记得切萨皮克地区有经济作物，比如烟草，而在新英格兰地区则更多的是宗教之类的事情，**但你不太确定其他更多的事情。你的头脑风暴笔记越有条理，你就会越好。现在你肯定会在分析文献后回到这个头脑风暴列表，并且**不可避免地你会**进行很多修改并添加一些内容，**但**最好还是先快速地进行一次“脑力倾泻”：你对这个主题了解多少？就像我说的，最多一到两分钟。**

**之所以这很重要，是因为通过"快速头脑风暴"，你很可能会想到一些可以用来得分的外部信息, 和历史例子。**例如，头脑风暴环节的一些信息, 可以用来帮助你构建你最终将在论文开头使用的背景化。我们将在另一个视频中更详细地讨论背景化，但基本上像这样：英国殖民地始于 1607 年的詹姆斯敦。新英格兰殖民地是由清教徒建立的。殖民化将会很困难。有股份公司。这是一个非常扎实的背景化的开始，可以为你赢得一分，而你甚至还没有接触任何文献。你头脑风暴的其他部分可能通过为你提供一个在历史上站得住脚的观点, 来谈论这两个地区之间的差异, 以及可能造成这种差异的原因，从而帮助你回答问题的一部分。所以你已经大致想到了一个地区有经济作物，另一个地区更多的是一个以宗教为基础的殖民地。你可能还记得那里有一个混合经济，以及来到不同地区的那些人的动机——新英格兰殖民地是为了"宗教自由"，清教徒来到那里，而切萨皮克地区则主要基于"利润"。所有这些都可以在你再次查看文献之前开始成形。

接下来可能是最难的部分：第三步——在 15 分钟左右的时间内, 解释和分析文献。在这样做的时候，你将需要记住这些问题来查看每份文献。你想到的第一个问题是：这份文献是关于什么的？你能用一句话概括其主要思想吗？现在你的论文不是关于总结文献的，但理解一份文献的主要观点很重要，并且将为你做好准备：这份文献如何与题目相关联？你将如何使用你对这份文献的分析来回答题目并支持你的论点或你的论证？这才是你应该对文献做的事情。你不是在描述文献是关于什么的，而是这份文献如何帮助捍卫你的论点。

下一个问题：你能否对文献中发现的证据进行分组或分类？这份文献是否与另一份文献提出或支持类似的、在历史上站得住脚的观点？如果两份文献都提出了关于切萨皮克和新英格兰殖民地之间差异的相同观点，你将需要在同一个主体段落中使用它们。你对文献分析的一部分是理解不同历史证据之间的关系。如果你能记住这一点将相似的文献分组在一起，一份文献可能会提供相互矛盾的证据——可以用来限定或修改论点的证据——如果是这种情况，你也将需要将这种类型的证据分组在一起。

当你阅读文献时，它是否引发了任何额外的外部信息——在文献中找不到的信息？如果是这样，也在页边空白处注明。最后，这份文献是否适合论文的扩展分析部分？我们将在下一个视频中详细介绍这一点。

现在，如果你像我刚开始学习 DBQ 时一样，你可能会觉得这太疯狂了。在面对你可能从未见过的题目上的一堆你可能从未见过的不同文献时，你需要记住这么多事情，而你又无法为此做好准备。听着，我两次就读于加州大学洛杉矶分校，主修历史，毕业时文凭上还有一些拉丁文，但在我的任何课程中，我从未做过如此复杂的事情。所以让我向你展示一下这在现实生活中可能是什么样子。

我认为当你分析文献时，制定某种组织思路的计划非常重要。我即将向你展示的这个模板是我的学生使用的，他们做得相当不错。如果你能养成将注释放在相同位置的习惯，它将帮助你组织思路，当轮到你写论文时，你将更有可能获得分数并成功完成这项任务。

所以在撰写 DBQ 的早期，我的学生就是这样组织思路的。首先，快速标注文献来源：谁写的？什么时候写的？这可能会引发一些想法。在文献上方写下任何有用的信息。当你阅读文献时，对其进行注释——标记它。虽然在实际的论文中你可能不会在页边空白处写太多笔记，但在开始时训练自己组织思路是一个好主意。在文献的左侧，我告诉我的学生简要写下几个词来说明文献是关于什么的。这是最重要的部分：这份文献如何帮助回答题目？思考：这份文献是否帮助你提出了一个可以在你的论点陈述中成为一部分的、在历史上站得住脚的观点？也把它写在左侧。

当你浏览文献时，你将需要将相似的文献或可以支持类似历史论点的文献分组在一起。同样，一份文献可能与另一份文献相矛盾，你需要在你的论文中承认这种复杂性，并也在左侧注明。在阅读文献时，你可能会想起文献中没有明确提到的历史信息。这有可能成为外部信息来为你赢得一些分数，我告诉我的学生也将任何外部信息写在右侧。

最后，你至少需要对三份文献进行扩展分析。我在我的课堂上使用首字母缩写 HIPPO。你使用哪个并不重要。我让我的学生将他们的扩展分析注释放在文献的右下角，因为他们已经习惯了在限时论文格式中完成评分标准的各个不同部分。

所以这是你在开始写论文之前真正应该做的三个步骤。在我的下一个视频中，你可以在描述中找到链接，我将带你了解你需要对文献做的所有不同事情，你将如何 HIPPO 分析它们，外部信息，你如何使用它们来推进论点。所以那一个会非常重要，就像我说过的，链接在描述中。

在本视频系列结束时，我希望你能够更轻松地撰写 APUSH DBQ。这只是过程的第一步——了解如何应对写作的每个阶段。如果这个视频对你有所帮助，请点击“喜欢”，如果你有任何问题，请留下评论，告诉一些朋友关于这个频道，并且一如既往，祝你拥有美好的一天。再见！

What's up, beautiful people? Today we're going to be taking a look at the steps to writing the DBQ essay. And I'm not going to lie to you -- this process is pretty brutal. But I've been doing this since 2004, and my students have been pretty successful. It is my hope that when you are done writing your essay and when your teacher is done reading it, the first thing they're going to say is: "It's amazing! So amazing!"

Now remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the journey of writing a DBQ begins with step one, which is to read and analyze the prompt. So this is the sample prompt that we are going to be working with, and I encourage you to pause and go ahead and read it. But the important thing is as you read the prompt, you should annotate the different parts of the question in the margins. Break down the question: What is the prompt asking you to do? Are there multiple parts to the question? And in this question, we need to describe and explain similarities and/or differences between the New England and the Chesapeake regions, and we also need to analyze why by 1700 these two regions evolved into two distinct societies.

You also want to identify what historical thinking skill is being assessed. In this case, we have a comparison question, and you will only be able to craft a clear thesis statement that answers all parts of the question if you understand the prompt in its entirety. You always want to make note of the time frame the question gives you. You will only get points for providing historical evidence within the time frame of the prompt. In this case, the prompt specifically mentions "by 1700," so nothing that happened after 1700 will be relevant to earning you points on the rubric. Usually, they will give you a time frame for the question. This prompt does not, but since the first permanent British settlement was established in 1607, it is safe to say your response should be largely focused on the time period 1607 to 1700.

Step two is quick brainstorming time. Now the documents are hopefully going to help you answer the question, but before you look at the documents, start thinking about how you might go about answering this question without any documents. After a very short brainstorm -- say less than two minutes -- you might have a list like this in the margins. So perhaps you remember the New England region is Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Puritans came there, there was a Massachusetts Bay Company. The Chesapeake was Virginia and Maryland, Jamestown -- first British settlement, there was a starving time. If possible, try to organize your thoughts around different parts of the question. Think about: What are some things you know about New England colonies? What are some things you know about the Chesapeake region? In this case, do you know any similarities? Differences? And finally, reasons they evolved into two distinct societies.

So you know some similarities -- maybe the only thing you can come up with is both regions had guys named John -- John Winthrop and John Smith. And when brainstorming some differences, maybe you actually remember the Chesapeake had cash crops, maybe there was like tobacco, whereas in New England it was like religion and stuff, but you're not entirely sure of much else. The more organized you can make your brainstorming notes, the better off you are going to be. Now you will definitely come back to this brainstorm list after analyzing the documents, and inevitably you will make a lot of revisions and have some stuff to add to it, but it's good to kind of do a quick brain dump: What do you know about the topic? Like I said, one to two minutes max.

The reason this is important is by quickly brainstorming, you will more than likely come up with some outside information and historical examples that you can use to get some points. For instance, some of the info from the brainstorming session could be used to help you develop your contextualization that you will eventually start your essay off with. Now we're going to go more into contextualization in another video, but basically things like: The British colonies started in 1607 with Jamestown. The New England colonies were founded by Puritans. Colonization would be difficult. There was joint stock companies. This is the beginning of a really solid contextualization that could get you a point, and you haven't even touched a document yet. And other parts of your brainstorm may help answer part of the question by providing you a historically defensible claim to talk about differences between the two regions and a possible reason for the difference. So you've already kind of come up with that one had cash crops, the other one was more of a religious-based colony. There was a mixed economy maybe you remember, and the motives of those coming to the different regions -- the New England colonies religious freedom whereas Puritans were coming there, whereas the Chesapeake was largely based upon profits. This could all kind of start to take shape early on before, once again, looking at documents.

Next is perhaps the hardest part: Step three -- interpret and analyze the documents in like 15 minutes. As you are doing this, you're going to want to view each document with these questions in mind. The first question you want to think about is: What is the document about? Could you summarize the big idea in one sentence? Now your essay is not about summarizing the documents, but understanding the main point of a document is important and will set you up for doing this: How does the document connect to the prompt? How would you use your analysis of the document to answer the prompt and to support your thesis or your argument? This is what you should be doing with the documents. You are not describing what the document is about, but how the document helps defend your thesis.

Next question: Can you group or categorize the evidence found in the document? Does the document connect or make a similar historically defensible claim as another document? If two documents make the same point about a difference between the Chesapeake and the New England colonies, you're going to want to use them in the same body paragraph. Part of your analysis of the documents is understanding the relationship between different pieces of historical evidence. If you can group similar documents together with that in mind, a document may offer contradictory evidence -- evidence that could be used to qualify or modify an argument -- and if that's the case, you're going to want to group that type of evidence together as well.

As you read the document, does it trigger any additional outside information -- information not found in the document? If so, note that in the margins as well. And finally, is this document good for the extended analysis portion of the essay? And we're going to cover that in a lot of detail in our next video.

Now if you were like me when I first started learning about the DBQ, I thought this was crazy. That's a whole lot of things to keep in mind when looking at a bunch of different documents that you probably never seen before on a prompt that you've never seen before that you couldn't prepare for. Look, I went to UCLA twice, majoring in history, graduated with some Latin words on my diploma, and I never had to do something this complicated in any of my classes. So let me show you what this might look like in real life.

I think it's really important you come up with some kind of plan for organizing your thoughts when you are analyzing the documents. This template I'm about to show you is what my students use, and they've been doing pretty well with it. And if you can get into the habit of putting your annotations in the same spot, it will help you organize your thoughts, and when it's time to write your essay, you should be in a better position to get the points and to get out of this thing alive.

So early on when writing a DBQ, this is how my students organize their thoughts. First, quickly source the document: Who wrote it? When was it written? This might trigger some ideas. Jot anything useful down right above the document. As you read the document, annotate it -- mark it up. While on the actual essay you might not write too many notes in the margins, it's a good idea in the beginning to train yourself to organize your thoughts. On the left side of the document, I tell my students to jot a few words as to what the document is about. This is the most important part: How can the document help answer the prompt? Think about: Does this document help you come up with the historically defensible claim that can become a part of your thesis statement? Put this down on the left side as well.

And as you go through the documents, you're going to want to group similar documents or documents that can defend a similar historical claim. Likewise, a document may contradict another document, and you will want to acknowledge that complexity in your essay and make note of it also on the left-hand side. When reading the document, you might remember historical information that is not explicitly mentioned in the document. This can potentially become outside information to get you some points, and I tell my students to jot any outside information down right on the right-hand side as well.

And finally, you're gonna need to do an extended analysis of at least three documents. I use the acronym HIPPO in my classes. Whichever one you use doesn't really matter. I have my students put their extended analysis annotations on the bottom right of the document as they get used to doing all the different parts of the rubric into timed essay format.

So these are the three steps you should really do before you start writing your essay. In our next video, which you can find the link in the description, I'm going to walk you through all the different things you're going to need to do with the documents, how you're going to HIP them, outside information, how do you use them to advance a thesis. So that one's going to be really important, and like I said, the link is in the description.

By the end of this video series, it is my hope that you will feel more comfortable writing the APUSH DBQ. This is just the first step in the process -- knowing how to tackle each phase of the writing.
