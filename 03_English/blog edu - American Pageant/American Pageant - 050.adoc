What's going down APUSH people? 怎么了，美国历史课程（APUSH）的同学们？Today we're taking a look at 看一看 period 7. It goes from 1890 to 1945 -- the end of World War II -- and this bad boy （俚语，此处指重要内容）covers 17 - 7% of the APUSH exam. So to get you started, it's important you keep in mind kind of what are the major kind of events or periods during this time frame, and we're going to break it down 剖析 for you real quickly here.

If you take a look at the blue, you have in the 1890s to 1917 U.S. expansion abroad 海外扩张. We have U.S. imperialism 帝国主义 in places like Cuba, Hawaii, the Philippines, China. Then we have World War I -- we get into it late in 1917, it'll go until 1919. Then you have the period -- the interwar years 两次世界大战之间的时期 -- that period between World War I and World War II. The U.S. is somewhat isolationist 孤立主义的. Some of the events we'll take a look at in just a moment. And then of course in 1941, the U.S. will get into World War II.

In terms of domestic politics 国内政治, you really have from the 1890s to 1917 the Progressive Era reforms 进步时代改革, and a lot of different things are going down here during that time period domestically. Then you have of course World War I -- it will have impacts on the home front 大后方. That's followed up with the Roaring 20s -- you know, this time of relative economic prosperity 经济繁荣 for many people but not all. And then of course the Great Depression 大萧条 which will lead us into the New Deal 新政 from 1933 to about 1938, and then of course U.S. entry into World War II. Hit pause if you want to copy this down, but it's important to note that that stuff in the black is not meant to be all the important things during period 7, just some of the key things to give you an idea of what's going down during these different periods in American history foreign and domestically.

So first important idea here is in the late 19th century, some began to advocate for 倡导 overseas expansion, and there's a lot of different motives 动机. For example, the frontier 边疆 is closed. Frederick Jackson Turner takes a look at the 1890 census 人口普查 and says the frontier has closed, so we need to look abroad for new opportunities. You have economic motives -- remember the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 is in full swing 全面展开 and the U.S. some people want to open up markets abroad for example in China and get access to 获得 cheap raw materials 原材料. You have political motives -- a desire of the U.S. to compete with other nations especially Europe and Japan over in Asia. And that of course there are strategic or military motives 战略或军事动机 to acquire strategic interests 战略利益 for example naval bases 海军基地. Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote about this. And then finally we have ideological motives 意识形态动机 -- we had this duty some believe to civilize 使文明 the non - American non - European people abroad, bringing democracy and Christianity and other so - called markers of civilization 文明标志.

Some examples that you should know about for period 7 -- the U.S. annexation of Hawaii 吞并夏威夷. Queen Liliuokalani being removed from power and the debate over the annexation of Hawaii. The Open Door Policy 门户开放政策 under President McKinley in China -- that policy will be followed by other U.S. presidents. The big one is the Spanish - American War 美西战争 which was caused by a variety of factors such as the Maine explosion, yellow journalism 黄色新闻, the economic motives of the U.S. planters and plantation owners, and the de Lôme letter where McKinley got dissed 侮辱. Remember the Spanish - American War is hugely significant -- it is a turning point 转折点 because under the Treaty of Paris 《巴黎条约》the U.S. acquires Cuba, Puerto Rico, Philippines and Guam. In fact, you're going to have a brutal guerrilla war 游击战 between the U.S. and the Philippines. Remember Emilio Aguinaldo is the leader of the Filipino independence movement, and this is going to lead to the Filipinos being defeated in a very controversial war 有争议的战争.

You also have presidents pursuing not just McKinley but Roosevelt's Big Stick policy 大棒政策. You could see his intervention 干预 in Panama and the building of the canal. Taft's Dollar Diplomacy 金元外交. Wilson's Moral Diplomacy 道德外交. And you could see that really in Mexico. So these are all examples of U.S. expansion during this time period.

Another important thing you should know about is the debates over America's role in the world post - 1898 after the Spanish - American War. There were many people such as McKinley and the Roosevelts and Alfred Thayer Mahan who supported U.S. policies in Cuba, the Philippines, Hawaii and other locations. However, there was a growing American Anti - Imperialist League 美国反帝国主义联盟 which opposed really the annexation of the Philippines mobilizes those individuals, and you have people such as Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie opposing U.S. policies abroad.

Then during the pre - World War I period, the U.S. is neutral 中立的 at the start of World War I. Wilson tried to keep the country out of the war, but you have the sinking of neutral ships such as the Lusitania, the Zimmerman Telegram 齐默尔曼电报 to Mexico and other factors which causes the U.S. entry into World War I in 1917. Wilson plays a very active role in the post - war negotiations 在战后谈判中 at Versailles with his 14 Points proposal 十四点计划. He tries to get the rest of the Allies -- England and France -- to agree, but they only agree on the adoption of the League of Nations 国际联盟. They're not interested in self - determination 自决 in these types of things -- they want to punish Germany. The U.S. Senate led by Republican Henry Cabot Lodge rejected membership to the League of Nations, disappointing Wilson. And many see this as an effort to preserve the tradition of non - involvement 不介入 in European affairs and permanent alliances 永久联盟. Remember Washington in his farewell address 告别演说 warned the nation against those in 1796.

Following the World War I period, we'll get into the 1920s, and in the 1920s the U.S. will pursue a somewhat isolationist policy 孤立主义政策. We will reject membership to the League of Nations, but we will not be completely withdrawn from the rest of the world. For example, we have an active role in the Washington Naval Arms Deal 华盛顿海军军备协议, the Kellogg - Briand Pact 凯洛格 - 白里安公约, and in various economic matters in both Latin America and Europe. However, just like before World War I, we are going to attempt to stay out of the war. We are going to try to be isolationist. You're going to have a series of Neutrality Acts 中立法案 passed to keep the U.S. out of a potential war in Europe, and these are really supported by an important group called The America First Committee 美国优先委员会 headed by Charles Lindbergh and others. Finally of course, the attack on Pearl Harbor 珍珠港 on December 7th, 1941 will lead to U.S. entry into World War II. And after World War II, the U.S. will play a huge role in international affairs 国际事务 -- much different than any other period we've studied so far.

Some important stuff domestically -- keep in mind in the 1890s prior, we had large scale economic transformation 大规模经济转型 during this Gilded Age -- this Industrial Revolution. And as a result of these transformation, we're going to see the U.S. go from a laissez - faire 自由放任 to increased government intervention 政府干预, and this is really going to be seen in the Progressive Movement 进步运动. Progressive reformers 进步改革者 responded to economic instability 经济不稳定, social inequality 社会不平等 and political corruption 政治腐败, and they're going to call for government intervention in the economy and society as a whole. Progressive reformers were mainly focused on urban areas 城市地区 -- really their strength is in the cities. Remember the Populists 民粹主义者 also in the 1890s focused on rural areas 农村地区. The progressives were largely middle class 中产阶级, and there was a very large participation by women in the movement. And finally muckrakers 黑幕揭发者 are going to play a key role -- people like Upton Sinclair, Ida Tarbell exposing problems to the American public.

So real big idea about the Progressive Movement you should know is the progressives attempted to regulate the economy 监管经济, environment and expand democracy 扩大民主. Couple of examples to know about -- Jane Addams with the Hull House 赫尔馆 in Chicago providing help and assistance to poor and immigrant communities. You have Florence Kelley who creates the National Consumer League 全国消费者联盟 which goes for reforms from food safety, child labor issues 童工问题 and others. You have John Muir who was one of the founders of the Sierra Club 塞拉俱乐部 -- he links up with Theodore Roosevelt advocating for 倡导 protection of natural resources 自然资源 -- so preservation 保护 and conservation  conservation  conservation 保护. Robert La Follette's Wisconsin Idea 威斯康星理念 in his home state leads to democratization 民主化 -- you get reforms like the recall 罢免权, the referendum 公投 and initiative 创制权 -- all of these giving greater power to the people in the democratic process. You could see this democratization continuing with the 17th Amendment 第十七修正案 which provides for the direct election of senators 直接选举参议员.

And Theodore Roosevelt uses the old law -- the Sherman Antitrust Act 谢尔曼反托拉斯法 -- to break up monopolies 打破垄断 -- trust busting 反垄断. This is going to be done by both Roosevelt, Taft and Wilson. Wilson's going to have a new tool to do this called The Clayton Antitrust Act 克莱顿反托拉斯法 which gave more power to the government to regulate these monopolies. And finally, the Federal Reserve Bank 联邦储备银行 under Wilson creates a central bank 中央银行 to control the money supply 货币供应, and this is the first national banking system 国家银行体系 since that Second Bank of the U.S. that was defeated by Andrew Jackson.

When studying period 7, make sure you understand the different reforms and the successes and the failures of the Progressive Movement. Throughout this period, the U.S. continued to evolve into a increasingly industrialized 工业化的 and urban nation 城市国家. The Industrial Revolution is still continuing. Immigration, urbanization 城市化 and these changes dramatically changed American society. You continue to have the rise of large corporations 大企业 although they are increasingly regulated by the government to prevent corporate abuse 企业滥用权力. And by 1920, more Americans live in cities than in rural regions 农村地区 for the first time in our nation's history. New technology and consumer goods 消费品 -- in fact by the 1920s you're going to have the radio, the vacuum, the Model T. The movie industry 电影产业 is going to rise. These things are going to change life for many Americans and increased the standard of living 生活水平.

One of the key kind of themes during this time period is new opportunities for new groups. For example, you're going to continue to have large immigration, but that immigration's going to change. You're going to have the new immigrants who are especially from Southern and Eastern Europe which are coming to America moving into American cities to work in industrial jobs 工业工作. This is going to slow down in 1924 -- we'll see why in just a moment. Women got jobs during World War I and World War II. However, they were expected to leave when the men returned. But it's important to keep in mind new technology such as telephone, vacuums, washing machines created new job opportunities and office - type work as secretaries and provided some women with more leisure time 闲暇时间. And finally, African - Americans are going to undergo a lot of changes during this time period. You're going to have a Great Migration 大迁徙 really beginning in the early 1900s as this mass migration 大规模迁移 of African - Americans out of the Jim Crow South 吉姆·克劳南方 to Northern cities especially during World War I.

With all these changes, you're going to see a rise in conflict 冲突. Cultural, political and social tension 紧张局势 emerged as a result of changing demographics 人口结构, modernization 现代化 and a variety of other factors. And you're going to see some of these tensions both during World War I and during the economic prosperity or the relative economic prosperity of the Roaring 20s. So let me give you a couple of examples to keep in mind. During the war -- World War I -- you have the Espionage and Sedition Act 间谍法和煽动叛乱法 passed. The Sedition Act especially was designed to limit freedom of speech 言论自由 and other perceived anti - war attitudes 反战态度 during World War I. Many people were arrested during the war for being nothing more than opposed to U.S. fighting of the war, and this was ruled of course constitutional 合宪的 by the famous Schenck v. United States case 申克诉美国案. And this really shows you that tension between security 安全 versus liberty 自由 in American society.

Following World War I, you have the Red Scare 红色恐慌 and the Palmer Raids 帕尔默大搜捕 which led to mass arrests 大规模逮捕 of socialist, anarchist 无政府主义者, union organizers 工会组织者 and other suspected radicals 激进分子. In the 20s you also see the arrest and the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti -- once again the tension security versus liberty, native born Americans versus immigrants, capitalists 资本家 versus radicals and workers. So you see once again tension occurring in American society. The Immigration Act of 1924 1924年移民法 was passed in the 1920s. It was designed to keep out new immigrants by establishing a quota 配额 of 2% taking this census of 1890. This was supported by the Ku Klux Klan 三K党 and other nativist organizations 本土主义组织, and it shows the nativist tension 本土主义紧张局势 of the 1920s. Scopes trial 斯科普斯审判 is another great example of the tensions of change -- a teacher in Dayton, Tennessee was arrested for teaching evolution 进化论, and you could see the kind of battle between fundamentalism 原教旨主义 of the 1920s and science -- the rural values versus urban.

Prohibition 禁酒令 was also passed at the beginning of the 1920s with the 18th Amendment 第十八修正案 -- an effort to ban the sale of alcohol 禁酒 led to widespread lawlessness 无法无天 and the rise of organized crime 有组织犯罪 -- people like Al Capone in Chicago. And then finally throughout this period, you're going to have tension amongst American society and African - Americans, and this is going to increase as the Great Migration to Northern cities increase racial tensions 种族紧张关系 and contributed to race riots 种族骚乱 and the resurgence 复兴 of the KKK in the 1920s.

The boom 繁荣 of the 1920s is going to be ended with the Great Depression. It begins in 1929. And another important idea of period 7 is the fact that economic upheavals 经济动荡 -- the problems associated with laissez - faire capitalism 自由放任资本主义 and ultimately the Great Depression -- led to the New Deal. And it's going to take place roughly from 1933 -- inauguration 就职典礼 of Franklin Roosevelt -- till around 1938. Couple things about the New Deal to keep in mind -- it focused on the three Rs. Remember it's designed to try to get the country out of the Great Depression, and it does so by providing relief 救济, recovery 复苏 and reform 改革. The New Deal reformed American society by creating a limited welfare state 福利国家 while also increasing the size of the federal government 联邦政府. Not all Americans are going to like these things, but it is going to provide that basic safety net 安全网.

Couple of Key New Deal programs to keep in mind -- FDIC 联邦存款保险公司 insured bank deposits 银行存款. Securities and Exchange Commission 证券交易委员会 regulated the stock market 股市. The AAA 农业调整法 sought to stop overproduction 过度生产 by paying farmers subsidies 补贴 not to produce crops. The WPA 公共工程管理局 and the Civilian Conservation Corps 民间资源保护队 paid the unemployed 失业者 to do public works projects 公共工程项目 -- build bridges, roads and other items. The Wagner Act -- also known as the National Labor Relations Act 全国劳工关系法 -- protected the rights of workers to form and join a union 工会. And Social Security 社会保障 established the safety net for those individuals -- the elderly, the disabled, women with dependent children and so on.

It's important when studying period 7 to kind of compare and contrast 比较和对比 the New Deal with the Progressive Era reforms. And some things to keep in mind about the New Deal -- it created a limited welfare state and dramatically increase the size of the federal government. We're still debating what is the appropriate role of the federal government even today. Some New Deal programs are still popular today such as Social Security and FDIC. And the New Deal continued reforms of the Progressive Era, and reforms of the New Deal will be followed up by other reform efforts such as the Fair Deal 公平交易 under President Truman and really the Great Society 伟大社会 under Lyndon Baines Johnson. So make sure you're able to compare and contrast these different reform periods.

It's important to note although the New Deal did not take up the cause of civil rights 民权, it oftentimes ignored the plight of African - Americans. African - Americans began to vote in large numbers for the Democratic Party under Franklin Roosevelt. There were critics of the New Deal. Some felt the New Deal did not do enough -- you had people like Huey Long who proposed a major redistribution of wealth 财富再分配 with his program Share Our Wealth program. You have conservatives 保守派 who thought the New Deal increased the size of the government too much and were really concerned about deficit spending 赤字支出. And the Supreme Court 最高法院 ruled some of the programs unconstitutional 违宪的 -- for example the National Recovery Act 全国工业复兴法 and the Agricultural Adjustment Act (
农业调整法). And finally, it did not completely end the Great Depression. The Depression was only ended as the country began to shift to war production 战争生产 for World War II.

Which leads us to the final thing in Period 7 -- World War II. World War II you should break down 分解 in two areas -- the home front 大后方 and the battlefield 战场. And a couple things to keep in mind about the home front -- World War II led to a shift to war production and contributed to the end of the Great Depression. Jobs in war industries 军工产业 led to new opportunities for women -- you have the famous Rosie the Riveter icon 铆钉女工形象 -- and other minority groups such as African - Americans. Although deported 驱逐 during the Great Depression, Mexican and Mexican - Americans were kicked out of the country -- it's called repatriation 遣返. The need for labor in the agricultural sector 农业部门 led to the Bracero Program 布拉塞罗计划 which allowed Mexican immigrants to come into the United States during World War II.

Although there was numerous opportunities presented by World War II on the home front, there were also tensions at home. You have African - Americans struggling for equality with the Double Victory campaign 双重胜利运动. You have the fight for Executive Order 8802 第8802号行政令 to provide equal opportunity 平等机会 in defense work 国防工作. The Japanese internment 日本人拘留营 which was upheld 维持 by Korematsu v. the United States  Korematsu诉美国案. And of course in Los Angeles you have the Zoot Suit Riots 佐特套装骚乱 between Mexican - American youth and American military personnel 军事人员.

And it's important to know scientific and technological advances 科技进步 such as the atomic bomb 原子弹 created by the Manhattan Project 曼哈顿计划 and the development of sonar 声呐 will aid the Allied cause 盟军事业. U.S. industrial power 工业实力 will be a major reason for the Allied victory along with the huge Red Army of the Soviet Union. But U.S. production is phenomenal 惊人的 during the war providing a lot of the supplies even before U.S. enters the war in 1941. The decision to drop the atomic bomb 原子弹 will remain a source of controversy 争议, so make sure you know about some of the different arguments for and against the dropping of the bomb.

And it's important to know the Big Three -- Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill -- will struggle to maintain their alliance of convenience 权宜联盟 as they debate wartime strategy 战时战略. Stalin continued to want the second front 第二战场, and he felt Churchill and Roosevelt were delaying that. And the post - war world -- Roosevelt and Churchill and later Truman -- are going to want a world based upon self - determination 自决, capitalism 资本主义 and these agreements were going to be difficult to achieve. And finally following World War II, the U.S. will emerge as a dominant superpower 超级大国 and end its tradition of avoiding foreign organizations. We are going to join the United Nations 联合国, and shortly after World War II we will also find ourselves engaged in a Cold War 冷战.

各位APUSH的同学们，大家好！今天我们要来看一下第七时期。它从1890年到1945年——第二次世界大战结束——这个重要时期占APUSH考试的17%到27%。所以首先，记住这个时期的一些主要事件或阶段非常重要，我们将在这里快速地为你们分解一下。

如果你们看一下蓝色部分，1890年代到1917年是美国的海外扩张时期。我们在古巴、夏威夷、菲律宾和中国等地推行美国帝国主义。然后是第一次世界大战——我们于1917年末卷入，一直持续到1919年。之后是两次世界大战之间的时期——战间期。美国在某种程度上是孤立主义的。我们稍后会看一下这个时期的一些事件。当然，在1941年，美国将卷入第二次世界大战。

就国内政治而言，从1890年代到1917年，你们真正看到的是进步时代的改革，在此期间国内发生了许多不同的事情。然后当然是第一次世界大战——它将对国内产生影响。紧随其后的是咆哮的二十年代——你们知道，对许多人来说，这是一个相对经济繁荣的时期，但并非所有人都是如此。然后当然是导致我们进入1933年到大约1938年罗斯福新政的大萧条，然后当然是美国卷入第二次世界大战。如果你们想记下来，可以暂停视频，但重要的是要注意，黑色字体部分并非第七时期的所有重要事件，只是一些关键事件，旨在让你们了解美国历史上这些不同时期国内外发生的事情。

因此，第一个重要的思想是，在19世纪后期，一些人开始主张海外扩张，这有很多不同的动机。例如，边疆关闭了。弗雷德里克·杰克逊·特纳研究了1890年的人口普查，认为边疆已经关闭，所以我们需要向海外寻求新的机会。你们有经济动机——记住工业革命正处于鼎盛时期，美国一些人希望在海外（例如在中国）开拓市场，并获得廉价的原材料。你们有政治动机——美国渴望与包括亚洲的欧洲和日本在内的其他国家竞争。当然，还有获取战略利益（例如海军基地）的战略或军事动机。阿尔弗雷德·塞耶·马汉对此进行了论述。最后，我们有意识形态动机——一些人认为我们有责任去文明化海外非美国、非欧洲的人民，将民主、基督教和其他所谓的文明标志带给他们。

关于第七时期，你们应该了解的一些例子——美国吞并夏威夷。莉莉乌卡拉尼女王被推翻以及关于吞并夏威夷的辩论。麦金利总统时期的中国门户开放政策——这项政策将被其他美国总统所遵循。最重要的是美西战争，它是由各种因素引起的，例如缅因号爆炸事件、黄色新闻、美国种植园主和种植园主的经济动机以及德洛梅信件中麦金利被羞辱。记住，美西战争具有极其重要的意义——这是一个转折点，因为根据《巴黎条约》，美国获得了古巴、波多黎各、菲律宾和关岛。事实上，美国和菲律宾之间将爆发一场残酷的游击战。记住，埃米利奥·阿奎纳尔多是菲律宾独立运动的领导人，这将导致菲律宾人在一场极具争议的战争中被击败。

你们还有总统们不仅奉行麦金利的政策，还有西奥多·罗斯福的“巨棒政策”。你们可以看到他对巴拿马的干预以及运河的建设。塔夫脱的“金元外交”。威尔逊的“道德外交”。你们可以在墨西哥真正看到这一点。因此，这些都是这一时期美国扩张的例子。

你们应该了解的另一个重要事情是1898年美西战争后关于美国在世界上的角色的辩论。许多人，例如麦金利、罗斯福和阿尔弗雷德·塞耶·马汉，都支持美国在古巴、菲律宾、夏威夷和其他地方的政策。然而，一个日益壮大的美国反帝国主义联盟反对吞并菲律宾，并动员了这些人，你们看到了像马克·吐温、安德鲁·卡内基这样的人反对美国在海外的政策。

然后在第一次世界大战前的时期，美国在第一次世界大战开始时保持中立。威尔逊试图让美国置身于战争之外，但中立船只（如卢西塔尼亚号）的沉没、齐默曼电报发往墨西哥以及其他因素导致美国于1917年卷入第一次世界大战。威尔逊在凡尔赛的战后谈判中发挥了非常积极的作用，提出了他的“十四点原则”。他试图让其他盟国——英国和法国——同意，但他们只同意采纳国际联盟。他们对这些类型的自决不感兴趣——他们想惩罚德国。由共和党人亨利·卡伯特·洛奇领导的美国参议院拒绝加入国际联盟，这让威尔逊感到失望。许多人认为这是为了维护不干涉欧洲事务和永久联盟的传统。记住，华盛顿在他的告别演说中于1796年警告国家不要这样做。

第一次世界大战结束后，我们将进入1920年代，在1920年代，美国将奉行某种程度的孤立主义政策。我们将拒绝加入国际联盟，但我们不会完全与世界其他地区脱离关系。例如，我们在华盛顿海军条约、凯洛格-白里安公约以及拉丁美洲和欧洲的各种经济事务中发挥着积极作用。然而，就像第一次世界大战之前一样，我们将试图置身于战争之外。我们将努力保持孤立主义。你们将看到通过了一系列中立法案，以使美国免于卷入欧洲可能发生的战争，这些法案得到了一个名为“美国第一委员会”的重要团体的支持，该委员会由查尔斯·林德伯格等人领导。当然，最终，1941年12月7日对珍珠港的袭击将导致美国卷入第二次世界大战。第二次世界大战后，美国将在国际事务中发挥巨大作用——与我们迄今为止研究的任何其他时期都大不相同。

一些重要的国内事务——记住在1890年代之前，我们在镀金时代——工业革命期间经历了大规模的经济转型。由于这些转型，我们将看到美国从自由放任转向加强政府干预，这将在进步运动中真正体现出来。进步改革者回应了经济不稳定、社会不平等和政治腐败，他们将呼吁政府干预整个经济和社会。进步改革者主要关注城市地区——他们的力量确实在城市。记住，1890年代的民粹主义者也关注农村地区。进步人士主要是中产阶级，妇女在运动中发挥了非常重要的作用。最后，揭发记者将发挥关键作用——像厄普顿·辛克莱、艾达·塔贝尔这样的人向美国公众揭露问题。

关于你们应该了解的进步运动，一个真正重要的思想是进步人士试图监管经济、环境并扩大民主。几个需要了解的例子——简·亚当斯在芝加哥的赫尔之家为贫困和移民社区提供帮助和援助。你们有弗洛伦斯·凯利，她创建了全国消费者联盟，该联盟致力于食品安全、童工问题和其他方面的改革。你们有约翰·缪尔，他是塞拉俱乐部的创始人之一——他与西奥多·罗斯福合作，倡导保护自然资源——因此是保护和保存。罗伯特·拉福莱特在他的家乡威斯康星州提出的“威斯康星思想”导致了民主化——你们看到了像罢免、公民投票和倡议这样的改革——所有这些都赋予了人民在民主进程中更大的权力。你们可以在第十七修正案中看到这种民主化的延续，该修正案规定直接选举参议员。

西奥多·罗斯福利用旧法——《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》——来打破垄断——托拉斯解体。罗斯福、塔夫脱和威尔逊都将这样做。威尔逊将拥有一个新的工具来做到这一点，称为《克莱顿反托拉斯法》，该法赋予政府更大的权力来监管这些垄断组织。最后，威尔逊领导下的联邦储备银行建立了一个中央银行来控制货币供应，这是自安德鲁·杰克逊击败美国第二银行以来的第一个国家银行系统。

在学习第七时期时，确保你们理解进步运动的不同改革及其成功和失败。在整个这一时期，美国继续发展成为一个日益工业化和城市化的国家。工业革命仍在继续。移民、城市化和这些变化极大地改变了美国社会。大型公司继续崛起，尽管它们越来越受到政府的监管以防止公司滥用权力。到1920年，我们国家历史上第一次，居住在城市的人口超过了农村地区的人口。新技术和消费品——事实上，到1920年代，你们将拥有收音机、真空吸尘器和T型车。电影工业将兴起。这些事物将改变许多美国人的生活并提高生活水平。

这一时期的一个关键主题是为新群体提供新的机会。例如，你们将继续看到大规模移民，但这种移民将会发生变化。你们将看到来自南欧和东欧的新移民涌入美国城市，从事工业工作。这种情况将在1924年放缓——我们稍后会看到原因。妇女在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战期间获得了工作。然而，当男子返回时，她们被期望离开。但重要的是要记住，电话、真空吸尘器、洗衣机等新技术创造了新的就业机会和办公室类型的工作，例如秘书，并为一些妇女提供了更多的闲暇时间。最后，非裔美国人在此期间将经历许多变化。随着非裔美国人从吉姆·克劳南方大规模迁移到北方城市，尤其是在第一次世界大战期间，你们将看到一场真正始于1900年代初的大迁徙。

随着所有这些变化，你们将看到冲突的加剧。由于人口结构的变化、现代化和各种其他因素，出现了文化、政治和社会紧张局势。你们将在第一次世界大战期间以及咆哮的二十年代的经济繁荣或相对经济繁荣时期看到一些这些紧张局势。让我给你们几个需要记住的例子。在战争期间——第一次世界大战期间——你们通过了《间谍法》和《煽动叛乱法》。《煽动叛乱法》尤其旨在限制言论自由和第一次世界大战期间其他被认为反战的态度。许多人仅仅因为反对美国参战而在战争期间被捕，这当然被著名的申克诉美国案裁定为合宪。这真正向你们展示了美国社会中安全与自由之间的紧张关系。

第一次世界大战后，你们看到了“红色恐慌”和“帕尔默突袭”，导致社会主义者、无政府主义者、工会组织者和其他被怀疑的激进分子遭到大规模逮捕。在20年代，你们还看到了萨科和万泽蒂的逮捕和审判——再一次是安全与自由、本土美国人与移民、资本家与激进分子和工人之间的紧张关系。因此，你们再次看到美国社会中出现了紧张局势。1924年的《移民法案》在1920年代通过。它旨在通过建立基于1890年人口普查的2%的配额来阻止新移民入境。这得到了三K党和其他本土主义组织的支持，它显示了1920年代的本土主义紧张局势。斯科普斯审判是另一个变革时期紧张局势的绝佳例子——田纳西州代顿市的一名教师因教授进化论而被捕，你们可以看到1920年代的基要主义与科学之间的斗争——农村价值观与城市价值观的斗争。

禁酒令也在1920年代初通过了第十八修正案——一项禁止酒精饮料销售的努力导致了普遍的无法无天和有组织犯罪的兴起——例如芝加哥的艾尔·卡彭。最后，在整个这一时期，美国社会和非裔美国人之间将存在紧张关系，随着大迁徙到北方城市加剧种族紧张并导致种族骚乱和1920年代三K党的复兴，这种情况将加剧。

1920年代的繁荣将被大萧条所终结。它始于1929年。第七时期的另一个重要思想是，经济动荡——与自由放任资本主义相关的问题以及最终的大萧条——导致了新政。它大致从1933年——富兰克林·罗斯福就职——持续到1938年左右。关于新政，需要记住几件事——它侧重于“3R”原则。记住，它的目的是试图使国家摆脱大萧条，它通过提供救济、复苏和改革来实现这一目标。新政通过建立有限的福利国家并扩大联邦政府的规模来改革美国社会。并非所有美国人都喜欢这些措施，但它将提供基本的社会保障网。

需要记住的几个关键的新政项目——联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）为银行存款提供保险。证券交易委员会（SEC）监管股票市场。农业调整管理局（AAA）试图通过向农民支付不生产作物的补贴来阻止过度生产。工程进展管理局（WPA）和民间资源保护队（CCC）向失业者支付工资以从事公共工程项目——修建桥梁、道路和其他设施。《瓦格纳法案》——也称为《国家劳工关系法》——保护工人组建和加入工会的权利。社会保障为那些个人——老年人、残疾人、有受抚养子女的妇女等——建立了安全网。

在学习第七时期时，比较和对比新政与进步时代的改革非常重要。关于新政，需要记住一些事情——它建立了一个有限的福利国家并极大地增加了联邦政府的规模。即使在今天，我们仍在争论联邦政府的适当角色是什么。一些新政项目在今天仍然很受欢迎，例如社会保障和联邦存款保险公司。新政延续了进步时代的改革，新政的改革之后还将有其他改革努力，例如杜鲁门总统的“公平施政”和林登·贝恩斯·约翰逊总统的“伟大社会”。因此，确保你们能够比较和对比这些不同的改革时期。

重要的是要注意，尽管新政没有采纳民权事业，但它经常忽视非裔美国人的困境。在富兰克林·罗斯福领导下，非裔美国人开始大量投票给民主党。有人批评新政。一些人认为新政做得不够——你们有像休伊·朗这样的人，他提出了通过他的“分享财富”计划进行大规模的财富再分配。保守派认为新政过度扩大了政府规模，并且非常担心赤字支出。最高法院裁定一些项目违宪——例如《全国工业复兴法》和《农业调整法》。最后，它并没有完全结束大萧条。只有当国家开始转向第二次世界大战的战争生产时，大萧条才结束。

这就引出了第七时期的最后一件事——第二次世界大战。你们应该将第二次世界大战分为两个方面——国内战场和海外战场。关于国内战场，需要记住几件事——第二次世界大战导致转向战争生产并有助于结束大萧条。战争工业中的就业为妇女（你们有著名的“铆钉女工罗西”的象征）和其他少数族裔群体（例如非裔美国人）带来了新的机会。尽管在大萧条时期被驱逐出境，但墨西哥人和墨西哥裔美国人被赶出了这个国家——这被称为遣返。农业部门对劳动力的需求导致了“布拉塞罗计划”，该计划允许墨西哥移民在第二次世界大战期间进入美国。

尽管第二次世界大战在国内带来了许多机会，但国内也存在紧张局势。你们有非裔美国人通过“双重胜利”运动争取平等。你们为争取第8802号行政命令以在国防工作中提供平等机会而奋斗。日本人的拘留营被科雷马苏诉美国案所维持。当然，在洛杉矶，你们看到了墨西哥裔美国青年和美国军事人员之间的“祖特套装暴动”。

重要的是要知道，像曼哈顿计划制造的原子弹和声纳的发展这样的科学技术进步将有助于盟军的事业。美国的工业实力将是盟军胜利的主要原因，苏联庞大的红军也是如此。但在战争期间，美国的生产非常惊人，甚至在1941年美国参战之前就提供了大量的物资。投放原子弹的决定将仍然是一个争议的焦点，因此请务必了解一些支持和反对投放原子弹的不同论点。

重要的是要知道“三巨头”——罗斯福、斯大林和丘吉尔——在讨论战时战略时，将努力维持他们权宜之计的联盟。斯大林一直想要第二战场，他认为丘吉尔和罗斯福在拖延。战后世界——罗斯福、丘吉尔以及后来的杜鲁门——将想要一个基于自决和资本主义的世界，而这些协议将难以达成。最后，第二次世界大战后，美国将崛起成为一个占主导地位的超级大国，并结束其避免加入国际组织的传统。我们将加入联合国，在第二次世界大战结束后不久，我们还将发现自己卷入了冷战。

What's going down APUSH people? Today we're taking a look at period 7. It goes from 1890 to 1945 -- the end of World War II -- and this bad boy covers 17-7% of the APUSH exam. So to get you started, it's important you keep in mind kind of what are the major kind of events or periods during this time frame, and we're going to break it down for you real quickly here.

If you take a look at the blue, you have in the 1890s to 1917 U.S. expansion abroad. We have U.S. imperialism in places like Cuba, Hawaii, the Philippines, China. Then we have World War I -- we get into it late in 1917, it'll go until 1919. Then you have the period -- the interwar years -- that period between World War I and World War II. The U.S. is somewhat isolationist. Some of the events we'll take a look at in just a moment. And then of course in 1941, the U.S. will get into World War II.

In terms of domestic politics, you really have from the 1890s to 1917 the Progressive Era reforms, and a lot of different things are going down here during that time period domestically. Then you have of course World War I -- it will have impacts on the home front. That's followed up with the Roaring 20s -- you know, this time of relative economic prosperity for many people but not all. And then of course the Great Depression which will lead us into the New Deal from 1933 to about 1938, and then of course U.S. entry into World War II. Hit pause if you want to copy this down, but it's important to note that that stuff in the black is not meant to be all the important things during period 7, just some of the key things to give you an idea of what's going down during these different periods in American history foreign and domestically.

So first important idea here is in the late 19th century, some began to advocate for overseas expansion, and there's a lot of different motives. For example, the frontier is closed. Frederick Jackson Turner takes a look at the 1890 census and says the frontier has closed, so we need to look abroad for new opportunities. You have economic motives -- remember the Industrial Revolution is in full swing and the U.S. some people want to open up markets abroad for example in China and get access to cheap raw materials. You have political motives -- a desire of the U.S. to compete with other nations especially Europe and Japan over in Asia. And that of course there are strategic or military motives to acquire strategic interests for example naval bases. Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote about this. And then finally we have ideological motives -- we had this duty some believe to civilize the non-American non-European people abroad, bringing democracy and Christianity and other so-called markers of civilization.

Some examples that you should know about for period 7 -- the U.S. annexation of Hawaii. Queen Liliuokalani being removed from power and the debate over the annexation of Hawaii. The Open Door Policy under President McKinley in China -- that policy will be followed by other U.S. presidents. The big one is the Spanish-American War which was caused by a variety of factors such as the Maine explosion, yellow journalism, the economic motives of the U.S. planters and plantation owners, and the de Lôme letter where McKinley got dissed. Remember the Spanish-American War is hugely significant -- it is a turning point because under the Treaty of Paris the U.S. acquires Cuba, Puerto Rico, Philippines and Guam. In fact, you're going to have a brutal guerrilla war between the U.S. and the Philippines. Remember Emilio Aguinaldo is the leader of the Filipino independence movement, and this is going to lead to the Filipinos being defeated in a very controversial war.

You also have presidents pursuing not just McKinley but Roosevelt's Big Stick policy. You could see his intervention in Panama and the building of the canal. Taft's Dollar Diplomacy. Wilson's Moral Diplomacy. And you could see that really in Mexico. So these are all examples of U.S. expansion during this time period.

Another important thing you should know about is the debates over America's role in the world post-1898 after the Spanish-American War. There were many people such as McKinley and the Roosevelts and Alfred Thayer Mahan who supported U.S. policies in Cuba, the Philippines, Hawaii and other locations. However, there was a growing American Anti-Imperialist League which opposed really the annexation of the Philippines mobilizes those individuals, and you have people such as Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie opposing U.S. policies abroad.

Then during the pre-World War I period, the U.S. is neutral at the start of World War I. Wilson tried to keep the country out of the war, but you have the sinking of neutral ships such as the Lusitania, the Zimmerman Telegram to Mexico and other factors which causes the U.S. entry into World War I in 1917. Wilson plays a very active role in the post-war negotiations at Versailles with his 14 Points proposal. He tries to get the rest of the Allies -- England and France -- to agree, but they only agree on the adoption of the League of Nations. They're not interested in self-determination in these types of things -- they want to punish Germany. The U.S. Senate led by Republican Henry Cabot Lodge rejected membership to the League of Nations, disappointing Wilson. And many see this as an effort to preserve the tradition of non-involvement in European affairs and permanent alliances. Remember Washington in his farewell address warned the nation against those in 1796.

Following the World War I period, we'll get into the 1920s, and in the 1920s the U.S. will pursue a somewhat isolationist policy. We will reject membership to the League of Nations, but we will not be completely withdrawn from the rest of the world. For example, we have an active role in the Washington Naval Arms Deal, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and in various economic matters in both Latin America and Europe. However, just like before World War I, we are going to attempt to stay out of the war. We are going to try to be isolationist. You're going to have a series of Neutrality Acts passed to keep the U.S. out of a potential war in Europe, and these are really supported by an important group called The America First Committee headed by Charles Lindbergh and others. Finally of course, the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941 will lead to U.S. entry into World War II. And after World War II, the U.S. will play a huge role in international affairs -- much different than any other period we've studied so far.

Some important stuff domestically -- keep in mind in the 1890s prior, we had large scale economic transformation during this Gilded Age -- this Industrial Revolution. And as a result of these transformation, we're going to see the U.S. go from a laissez-faire to increased government intervention, and this is really going to be seen in the Progressive Movement. Progressive reformers responded to economic instability, social inequality and political corruption, and they're going to call for government intervention in the economy and society as a whole. Progressive reformers were mainly focused on urban areas -- really their strength is in the cities. Remember the Populists also in the 1890s focused on rural areas. The progressives were largely middle class, and there was a very large participation by women in the movement. And finally muckrakers are going to play a key role -- people like Upton Sinclair, Ida Tarbell exposing problems to the American public.

So real big idea about the Progressive Movement you should know is the progressives attempted to regulate the economy, environment and expand democracy. Couple of examples to know about -- Jane Addams with the Hull House in Chicago providing help and assistance to poor and immigrant communities. You have Florence Kelley who creates the National Consumer League which goes for reforms from food safety, child labor issues and others. You have John Muir who was one of the founders of the Sierra Club -- he links up with Theodore Roosevelt advocating for protection of natural resources -- so preservation and conservation. Robert La Follette's Wisconsin Idea in his home state leads to democratization -- you get reforms like the recall, the referendum and initiative -- all of these giving greater power to the people in the democratic process. You could see this democratization continuing with the 17th Amendment which provides for the direct election of senators.

And Theodore Roosevelt uses the old law -- the Sherman Antitrust Act -- to break up monopolies -- trust busting. This is going to be done by both Roosevelt, Taft and Wilson. Wilson's going to have a new tool to do this called The Clayton Antitrust Act which gave more power to the government to regulate these monopolies. And finally, the Federal Reserve Bank under Wilson creates a central bank to control the money supply, and this is the first national banking system since that Second Bank of the U.S. that was defeated by Andrew Jackson.

When studying period 7, make sure you understand the different reforms and the successes and the failures of the Progressive Movement. Throughout this period, the U.S. continued to evolve into a increasingly industrialized and urban nation. The Industrial Revolution is still continuing. Immigration, urbanization and these changes dramatically changed American society. You continue to have the rise of large corporations although they are increasingly regulated by the government to prevent corporate abuse. And by 1920, more Americans live in cities than in rural regions for the first time in our nation's history. New technology and consumer goods -- in fact by the 1920s you're going to have the radio, the vacuum, the Model T. The movie industry is going to rise. These things are going to change life for many Americans and increased the standard of living.

One of the key kind of themes during this time period is new opportunities for new groups. For example, you're going to continue to have large immigration, but that immigration's going to change. You're going to have the new immigrants who are especially from Southern and Eastern Europe which are coming to America moving into American cities to work in industrial jobs. This is going to slow down in 1924 -- we'll see why in just a moment. Women got jobs during World War I and World War II. However, they were expected to leave when the men returned. But it's important to keep in mind new technology such as telephone, vacuums, washing machines created new job opportunities and office-type work as secretaries and provided some women with more leisure time. And finally, African-Americans are going to undergo a lot of changes during this time period. You're going to have a Great Migration really beginning in the early 1900s as this mass migration of African-Americans out of the Jim Crow South to Northern cities especially during World War I.

With all these changes, you're going to see a rise in conflict. Cultural, political and social tension emerged as a result of changing demographics, modernization and a variety of other factors. And you're going to see some of these tensions both during World War I and during the economic prosperity or the relative economic prosperity of the Roaring 20s. So let me give you a couple of examples to keep in mind. During the war -- World War I -- you have the Espionage and Sedition Act passed. The Sedition Act especially was designed to limit freedom of speech and other perceived anti-war attitudes during World War I. Many people were arrested during the war for being nothing more than opposed to U.S. fighting of the war, and this was ruled of course constitutional by the famous Schenck v. United States case. And this really shows you that tension between security versus liberty in American society.

Following World War I, you have the Red Scare and the Palmer Raids which led to mass arrests of socialist, anarchist, union organizers and other suspected radicals. In the 20s you also see the arrest and the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti -- once again the tension security versus liberty, native born Americans versus immigrants, capitalists versus radicals and workers. So you see once again tension occurring in American society. The Immigration Act of 1924 was passed in the 1920s. It was designed to keep out new immigrants by establishing a quota of 2% taking this census of 1890. This was supported by the Ku Klux Klan and other nativist organizations, and it shows the nativist tension of the 1920s. Scopes trial is another great example of the tensions of change -- a teacher in Dayton, Tennessee was arrested for teaching evolution, and you could see the kind of battle between fundamentalalism of the 1920s and science -- the rural values versus urban.

Prohibition was also passed at the beginning of the 1920s with the 18th Amendment -- an effort to ban the sale of alcohol led to widespread lawlessness and the rise of organized crime -- people like Al Capone in Chicago. And then finally throughout this period, you're going to have tension amongst American society and African-Americans, and this is going to increase as the Great Migration to Northern cities increase racial tensions and contributed to race riots and the resurgence of the KKK in the 1920s.

The boom of the 1920s is going to be ended with the Great Depression. It begins in 1929. And another important idea of period 7 is the fact that economic upheavals -- the problems associated with laissez-faire capitalism and ultimately the Great Depression -- led to the New Deal. And it's going to take place roughly from 1933 -- inauguration of Franklin Roosevelt -- till around 1938. Couple things about the New Deal to keep in mind -- it focused on the three Rs. Remember it's designed to try to get the country out of the Great Depression, and it does so by providing relief, recovery and reform. The New Deal reformed American society by creating a limited welfare state while also increasing the size of the federal government. Not all Americans are going to like these things, but it is going to provide that basic safety net.

Couple of Key New Deal programs to keep in mind -- FDIC insured bank deposits. Securities and Exchange Commission regulated the stock market. The AAA sought to stop overproduction by paying farmers subsidies not to produce crops. The WPA and the Civilian Conservation Corps paid the unemployed to do public works projects -- build bridges, roads and other items. The Wagner Act -- also known as the National Labor Relations Act -- protected the rights of workers to form and join a union. And Social Security established the safety net for those individuals -- the elderly, the disabled, women with dependent children and so on.

It's important when studying period 7 to kind of compare and contrast the New Deal with the Progressive Era reforms. And some things to keep in mind about the New Deal -- it created a limited welfare state and dramatically increase the size of the federal government. We're still debating what is the appropriate role of the federal government even today. Some New Deal programs are still popular today such as Social Security and FDIC. And the New Deal continued reforms of the Progressive Era, and reforms of the New Deal will be followed up by other reform efforts such as the Fair Deal under President Truman and really the Great Society under Lyndon Baines Johnson. So make sure you're able to compare and contrast these different reform periods.

It's important to note although the New Deal did not take up the cause of civil rights, it oftentimes ignored the plight of African-Americans. African-Americans began to vote in large numbers for the Democratic Party under Franklin Roosevelt. There were critics of the New Deal. Some felt the New Deal did not do enough -- you had people like Huey Long who proposed a major redistribution of wealth with his program Share Our Wealth program. You have conservatives who thought the New Deal increased the size of the government too much and were really concerned about deficit spending. And the Supreme Court ruled some of the programs unconstitutional -- for example the National Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. And finally, it did not completely end the Great Depression. The Depression was only ended as the country began to shift to war production for World War II.

Which leads us to the final thing in Period 7 -- World War II. World War II you should break down in two areas -- the home front and the battlefield. And a couple things to keep in mind about the home front -- World War II led to a shift to war production and contributed to the end of the Great Depression. Jobs in war industries led to new opportunities for women -- you have the famous Rosie the Riveter icon -- and other minority groups such as African-Americans. Although deported during the Great Depression, Mexican and Mexican-Americans were kicked out of the country -- it's called repatriation. The need for labor in the agricultural sector led to the Bracero Program which allowed Mexican immigrants to come into the United States during World War II.

Although there was numerous opportunities presented by World War II on the home front, there were also tensions at home. You have African-Americans struggling for equality with the Double Victory campaign. You have the fight for Executive Order 8802 to provide equal opportunity in defense work. The Japanese internment which was upheld by Korematsu v. the United States. And of course in Los Angeles you have the Zoot Suit Riots between Mexican-American youth and American military personnel.

And it's important to know scientific and technological advances such as the atomic bomb created by the Manhattan Project and the development of sonar will aid the Allied cause. U.S. industrial power will be a major reason for the Allied victory along with the huge Red Army of the Soviet Union. But U.S. production is phenomenal during the war providing a lot of the supplies even before U.S. enters the war in 1941. The decision to drop the atomic bomb will remain a source of controversy, so make sure you know about some of the different arguments for and against the dropping of the bomb.

And it's important to know the Big Three -- Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill -- will struggle to maintain their alliance of convenience as they debate wartime strategy. Stalin continued to want the second front, and he felt Churchill and Roosevelt were delaying that. And the post-war world -- Roosevelt and Churchill and later Truman -- are going to want a world based upon self-determination, capitalism and these agreements were going to be difficult to achieve. And finally following World War II, the U.S. will emerge as a dominant superpower and end its tradition of avoiding foreign organizations. We are going to join the United Nations, and shortly after World War II we will also find ourselves engaged in a Cold War.
