What's up 怎么了, beautiful people? In this video, I'm going to share with you how to read and study for AP US history 美国历史大学先修课程. I've been in the APUSH gang for 16 years, and my methods have not only been very helpful in saving my students a ton of time when studying, but also have led to success on the exam and, most importantly, help them learn a ton of cool history.

Now most of the resources I'm gonna be mentioning can be found in one of two spots. The first one is APUSHExplained.com -- it's a website with a bunch of free stuff, everything from history and government resources -- and the YouTube channel JOC Productions, where I have playlists 播放列表 for all the different periods in AP US history.

Now step one is pretty darn simple. You're gonna go ahead and download the slides 幻灯片. The slides have pretty much all of the essential information 基本信息 for each time period. Now here is the little secret -- it does not matter which textbook 教科书 you are using, which edition 版本 you are using. Content is content. So if you go on the website, you will see for instance it may say chapter one for The American Pageant, but if you're studying the time period 1491 to 1607, this video is gonna break down all the essential information that you should know about, especially for APUSH.

What I have done in these videos is take each period in American history and boiled it down 浓缩 into what is important -- the topics, the themes, the connections to the curriculum 课程大纲. So it doesn't really matter which book you're using. If you're studying the southern colonies, this video will help you out, these slides will help you out.

Now there's two different ways you can access the slides. The first one is from the website -- you can go ahead and click the reading guide 阅读指南, and it's gonna bring you right there to the note guide. And you can see you have all the slides right here. Anything in red is probably super important -- you're gonna want to pay attention to that. And you can also get them right from the description in the video.

Now once you have your copy of the chapter guide, it is time to preview the chapter 预习章节 by watching the video before coming to class. And watching the video, you are going to get that overview 概述 of the important topics and themes of the chapter, and you're gonna find out what you need to focus on as you read. My recommendation -- while watching the video, you annotate 做注解 the left side of the notes.

My advice is to print the guide out and write out your annotations on the left-hand side. And as you can see in the picture on the right, one of my students has done exactly that with the video about the southern colonies. If you can't print it out or would rather save a tree 环保, you can use some tools in Google Docs to directly annotate on the left side of the Google Doc. Either way, you want to engage with 参与 what the video is saying. What are the key topics? Put little stars next to things you're confused about, so when you go into your reading, you have an area of focus 重点区域.

Now this is the step you're probably going to be tempted to skip -- but read the textbook. And the reason why this is not as scary as it sounds is the heavy lifting 繁重工作 has already been done. On the left side, the most important information is already there for use -- like 75% of the work is done. When you're reading the textbook, you're gonna go ahead and annotate the right side of the slide. This is where you put the information in your own words, you make connections to the key concepts 关键概念, and you help make sense of 理解 the material.

I recommend citing the page number 引用页码 like this student did, because if you bomb a test 考试考砸 or if you need to review for an essay, you can quickly look back into the book and know exactly where they talk about Bacon's Rebellion or the Powhatan War. If you're doing this digitally, you can just kind of type your notes right here. You can change the font size 字体大小, make it even smaller, you can create little connections. You know, don't write big long complete sentences -- just jot down 快速记下 the essential information in your own words in a way that you can easily understand.

So let me give you a little example of how this might look. So say you're reading about English colonial society 英国殖民社会 -- it doesn't really matter the book you're using -- but you're about to come across Bacon's Rebellion. You have the slides in front of you -- you know the essentials of Bacon's Rebellion, the background, what it led to. And then you open up your textbook, and if you're reading The American Pageant, they're gonna give you a bunch of things you don't really need to know, but it does make the story a little bit more interesting sometimes.

So you come across this sentence: "Mostly single young men, they were frustrated by their broken hopes of acquiring land as well as by their failure to find single women to marry." Whoa, that's deep, you know? And as you read the section about Bacon's Rebellion -- like I said -- you already know what's important. You want to put it in your own words. So there's lots of single men without opportunity. Many are out in the backcountry 偏远地区, which basically is bad land. There's a lot of interactions with indigenous people 原住民. Berkeley had a monopoly 垄断 on the fur trade 毛皮贸易. He's reluctant to address the attacks because of this fur trade monopoly. And then this dude named Nathaniel Bacon was a 29-year-old planter 种植园主. None of that is on the slide, but it does help me understand what this is saying.

So all you're doing is kind of filling in the detail 补充细节 that allows you, when you come to class, to understand the history or to ask deep meaningful questions about the history. So that's really what these reading notes and these reading guides are intended to do -- break down the essential information and put it in your own words so it makes sense.

Now when you're done with the reading, if you're still confused, you can always circle back to 重新回到 the video, watch it again to get a quick overview, or you can go to the website APUSHExplained.com where we got all sorts of other resources, or you can bring questions to your class and ask your teacher, your classmates, and really start to break down this information.

Regardless, you've got this. You're gonna do well. You just need to focus, study, pay attention to the big picture 大局, why is history important -- make those connections, and you should do well. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments. Have a beautiful day. Peace!

大家好，各位！在这个视频中，我将和大家分享如何阅读和学习AP美国历史。我从事APUSH教学已有16年，我的方法不仅能帮助我的学生在学习时节省大量时间，而且还能让他们在考试中取得成功，最重要的是，帮助他们学习大量有趣的历史知识。

我现在要提到的许多资源都可以在两个地方找到。 第一个是 APUSHExplained.com ——这是一个包含大量免费内容的网站，涵盖历史和政府资源等各种内容——以及YouTube频道JOC Productions，我在那里为AP美国历史的所有不同时期都创建了播放列表。

第一步非常简单。你们要下载幻灯片。幻灯片几乎包含了每个时期的所有基本信息。现在，这是一个小秘密——你们使用哪本教科书，哪个版本并不重要。内容就是内容。所以如果你访问网站，你会看到例如它可能会说是《美国纪事》的第一章，但如果你正在学习1491年到1607年这个时期，这个视频将分解所有你应该知道的基本信息，特别是对于APUSH。

我在这些视频中所做的是，将美国历史的每个时期都提炼成重要的内容——主题、中心思想、与课程的联系。所以你们用哪本书并不重要。如果你正在学习南方殖民地，这个视频会对你有所帮助，这些幻灯片也会有所帮助。

现在有两种不同的方式可以访问幻灯片。第一种是从网站——你可以点击阅读指南，它会直接带你到笔记指南。你可以看到所有的幻灯片都在这里。任何红色的内容可能都非常重要——你需要注意它。你也可以直接从视频的描述中获取它们。

现在你已经有了章节指南的副本，是时候在来上课之前通过观看视频来预览章节了。观看视频，你将获得该章重要主题和中心思想的概述，并且你会知道在阅读时需要关注什么。我的建议是——在观看视频时，你在笔记的左侧进行注释。

我的建议是打印出指南，并在左侧写下你的注释。正如右图所示，我的一位学生在关于南方殖民地的视频中正是这样做的。如果你不能打印出来，或者更愿意节省纸张，你可以使用Google Docs中的一些工具直接在Google Doc的左侧进行注释。无论哪种方式，你都需要积极参与视频所说的内容。关键主题是什么？在你感到困惑的地方旁边画上小星星，这样当你开始阅读时，你就会有一个重点关注的区域。

现在这一步你可能很想跳过——但还是要读教科书。之所以说它不像听起来那么可怕，是因为大部分繁重的工作已经完成了。在左侧，最重要的信息已经在那里供你使用——大约75%的工作已经完成。当你阅读教科书时，你将在幻灯片的右侧进行注释。在这里，你用自己的话写下信息，你将信息与关键概念联系起来，并帮助理解材料。

我建议像这位学生一样标注页码，因为如果你考试考砸了，或者你需要复习一篇论文，你可以快速回顾书本，确切地知道他们在哪里谈论培根叛乱或波瓦坦战争。如果你是数字化的操作，你只需在这里键入你的笔记。你可以更改字体大小，使其更小，你可以创建小小的连接。你知道，不要写冗长的完整句子——只需用你自己的话记下你能轻松理解的基本信息。

让我给你们举个小例子，说明这可能是什么样子。假设你正在阅读关于英国殖民社会的内容——你用哪本书并不重要——但你即将读到培根叛乱。你面前有幻灯片——你知道培根叛乱的基本内容、背景、它导致了什么。然后你打开你的教科书，如果你读的是《美国纪事》，他们会给你一堆你并不真正需要知道的东西，但有时它确实会使故事更有趣一些。

所以你看到了这句话：“他们大多是单身青年男子，他们因获得土地的希望破灭以及未能找到单身女子结婚而感到沮丧。”哇，这很深刻，你知道吗？当你阅读关于培根叛乱的部分时——就像我说的——你已经知道什么是重要的。你想用自己的话表达出来。所以有很多没有机会的单身男性。许多人在边远地区，那里基本上是贫瘠的土地。与土著人民有很多互动。伯克利垄断了毛皮贸易。由于这种毛皮贸易的垄断，他不愿处理袭击事件。然后这个名叫纳撒尼尔·培根的家伙是一个29岁的种植园主。这些都没有在幻灯片上，但它确实帮助我理解了这句话的意思。

所以你所做的只是填补细节，当你来上课时，这些细节能让你理解历史，或者提出关于历史的深刻而有意义的问题。所以这才是这些阅读笔记和阅读指南的目的——分解基本信息，并用你自己的话表达出来，使其有意义。

现在，如果你读完后仍然感到困惑，你总是可以回到视频，再次观看以获得快速的概述， 或者你可以访问网站 APUSHExplained.com ，我们在那里有各种其他资源，或者你可以把问题带到课堂上问你的老师、同学，并真正开始分解这些信息。

无论如何，你行的。你会做得很好。你只需要集中注意力，学习，注意大局——为什么历史很重要——建立那些联系，你应该会做得很好。如果你有任何问题，请在评论中提出。祝你度过美好的一天。再见！
