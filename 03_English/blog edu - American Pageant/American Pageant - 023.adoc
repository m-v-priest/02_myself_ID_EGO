== 释义

What's going down, APUSH? Today we're going to look at the Industrial Revolution 工业革命，roughly from the Civil War all the way up until 1900. A couple things to know about the Industrial Revolution: by 1900, America would become the leading industrial power 工业强国 in the world. It's going to be a rapid 快速的 economic transformation 经济转型 of American society, and this is going to impact 影响 the country economically, socially, and politically. And really, manufacturing 制造业 is going to replace agriculture 农业 as the primary source 主要来源 of economic growth. And as a result of this rise of big business 大企业，you're going to have massive migrations 大规模移民 -- huge amounts of immigrants coming in, people moving within the United States as well -- as urbanization 城市化 -- people moving to the cities.

And so key to this is there's a huge number of inventions 发明 and innovations 创新 taking place, and this allows for greater productivity 生产力. A large number of new inventions are developed during this period, and a huge number of patents 专利 are issued 颁发. And as a result, some of those key ones: Alexander Graham Bell introduces the telephone, Thomas Edison with all of his inventions at Menlo Park with the electric light 电灯，and this allows for new changes to take place because these inventions and innovations will change daily lives 日常生活. They'll create new jobs for people and have social consequences 社会影响. And you could see that in the image right there with women entering the workforce 劳动力市场 as receptionists 接待员，secretaries 秘书，and other positions within companies.

Now the first big business in this era 时代 is going to be the railroads 铁路，and there's a huge increase of railroad production 铁路建设 after the Civil War. And it is really the result of land and loan subsidies 土地和贷款补贴 given by the federal government 联邦政府 to the railroad companies. This period was a period of laissez-faire 自由放任 when it comes to regulating companies, but the government is very pro-business 亲商的 and very much pro-railroad 支持铁路的 because they're basically hooking them up with land 给予土地支持. And the government's going to do this because they're going to hope that this is going to increase the value of federal land out in the west 西部联邦土地价值，and they're hoping to get preferred rates 优惠费率 for the carrying of federal mail 运送联邦邮件 or to transport troops 运送军队 out in the west.

And what you see is the railroad companies getting all this land, and these loans are going to establish new business practices 商业实践 such as establishing the modern stockholder corporation 现代股份制公司，business management strategies 企业管理策略，new ways of financing 融资方式，and the regulation of competition 竞争监管. And you're going to see the railroad grow tremendously 极大地. And with that, you're going to have consolidation 合并 -- meaning fewer and fewer railroad companies are controlling the market 控制市场 -- which is also going to lead to standardization 标准化 of the industry. For instance, the steel rail 钢轨 -- the transition 转变 to the steel rail -- and standardizing gauges 轨距标准化，the width between the track 轨道间距 -- this is key to allow for greater efficiency 效率.

As a result of the growth of the railroad, you also have this huge movement of people out into the trans-Mississippi West 密西西比河以西地区，and we're going to cover that in another lecture. But this age of railroads is happening at the same time as the settlement 定居 of the Great Plains 大平原. And key to this story is the first transcontinental railroad 横贯大陆的铁路. And if you recall, it was established actually during the Civil War by Republicans in Congress with the Pacific Railroad Act 太平洋铁路法案. They allowed for the route 路线 being established, and the federal government is going to help out in this process. And this gets started after the Civil War is over.

And they're going to divide the task between -- the blue line is going to be the Union Pacific 联合太平洋铁路公司，and they're going to build from Omaha, Nebraska to the west, and largely Irish workers, former Civil War veterans 退伍军人. And the other crew is going to be the Central Pacific company 中央太平洋铁路公司，and they're going to be building from Sacramento through the very difficult terrain 地形 of the Sierra Nevadas 内华达山脉，and they're going to have a huge reliance on 高度依赖 Chinese laborers 劳工 to do that very difficult work. And the big moment comes in 1869 at Promontory Point 普罗蒙特里峰 when the two companies meet, and the golden spike 金道钉 is laid marking the completion 完成 of the first transcontinental railroad.

And this is going to have huge consequences 影响. The building of the railroads are going to have huge impacts. It's going to unify 统一 the domestic market 国内市场，create a national market for goods 全国商品市场. It allows for the mass distribution 大规模分销 of raw materials 原材料 and manufactured goods 制成品 from coast to coast 从东海岸到西海岸. It's going to encourage mass production 大规模生产，mass consumption 大规模消费，and economic specialization 经济专业化 -- different parts of the country are going to be specializing on certain products 专注于特定产品. And finally, it's going to help promote the growth of other industries 促进其他行业发展 -- for example, coal 煤炭，steel 钢铁，etc. -- and lead to the growth of new cities 推动新城市发展. If your city's by a rail station 火车站，you're going to have a tremendous growth as a result. It's going to facilitate 促进 immigration both internally and externally 国内外移民，and it's going to change the lives of Americans. In fact, the American Railroad Association 美国铁路协会 divided the country into four time zones 时区 in 1883 so that there could be greater efficiency 提高效率，and later on the government would adopt 采纳 that as well.

Now we got a problem here because there was a lot of corruption 腐败 and wrongdoing 不法行为 in the railroad industry 铁路行业. If you remember from previous lectures, the Credit Mobilier scandal 美孚信贷公司丑闻 -- you had government officials 政府官员 being bribed 贿赂 by the railroad companies. And these railroad tycoons 铁路大亨 are becoming extremely powerful 极其强大. People like Cornelius Vanderbilt 科尼利厄斯・范德比尔特 are amassing 积累 huge amounts of wealth 巨额财富. And as a result, federal land grants 联邦土地授予 and friendly loans 优惠贷款 led that corruption to seep into 渗入 the government. You're going to have frequent speculative bubbles 投机泡沫 where you have overbuilding 过度建设 taking place, and that overbuilding will lead to economic chaos 经济混乱. Speculators 投机者 are attempting to sell overvalued stock 高估的股票 to the public. And as a result, this overbuilding leads to companies going bankrupt 破产 very frequently.

Mismanagement 管理不善 and fraud 欺诈 plagued 困扰 the industry. Rebates 回扣 or discounts 折扣 were oftentimes given to favored shippers 受优待的托运人，so there was all sorts of different pricing 定价方式. And as a result of this, small farmers 小农户 were often charged higher rates 收取更高费率 than others, and they're going to be the victims 受害者 of the powerful railroad companies. And pools 联营体 were created -- and pools were secret agreements 秘密协议 between the companies to fix rates 固定费率 and share profits 分享利润 -- so there really wasn't fair competition 公平竞争 taking place. And as a result of this concern over the railroad's power over the public and the government 铁路对公众和政府的影响力，there began to be discussions about should the government regulate 监管. There starts to be demands 要求 the government should intervene 干预.

Now keep in mind the dominant philosophy 主导哲学 of the time is laissez-faire -- leave alone 不干预，no regulation 不监管. But farmers become the most vocal group 呼声最高的群体 in calling for reform 呼吁改革. And really, you see that in the Grange movement 格兰其运动 -- we're going to cover that in another video. But the Grange movement is an organization of farmers demanding change 要求变革，and they get some regulations 法规. In the famous case of Munn versus Illinois 芒恩诉伊利诺伊州案 in 1877, the court rules 裁决 the state could regulate business 州可以监管企业. However, Munn versus Illinois -- those Granger laws 格兰其法 as they were called -- are overturned 推翻 in the Wabash case 沃巴什案 when the Court ruled that states could not regulate interstate commerce 州际贸易. And interstate commerce is trade between different states 州与州之间的贸易.

And the public begins to demand that the federal government does something to overhaul 彻底改革 the capitalist system 资本主义制度 during the Gilded Age 镀金时代，and you get the Interstate Commerce Act 州际商业法 passed in 1887. And it does a couple of things: it sets up the Interstate Commerce Commission 州际商业委员会 -- the federal government would oversee business 监督企业. They would ban pooling 联营，rebates 回扣，and rate fixing 固定费率. And companies -- railroad companies -- had to publish rates 公布费率. Now the Interstate Commerce Commission is important. It is the first large-scale attempt 大规模尝试 by the federal government to regulate business in the interest of society at large 为了社会整体利益监管企业. So the government is watching and monitoring business now 政府开始监管企业.

Important to keep in mind: the ICC was initially 最初 not very effective 有效，and it would not be until the Progressive Movement 进步运动 later on at the early 20th century where you're going to see more effective regulations being put in place 实施更有效的监管.

Now during this time, you also have the rise of other industries 其他行业兴起 -- the heavy industries 重工业. Railroad is just one, but you have oil 石油，steel 钢铁，and coal 煤炭 as well. And kind of the two figures 人物 that you should definitely know about is John D. Rockefeller 约翰・D・洛克菲勒，the head of Standard Oil 标准石油公司，and Andrew Carnegie 安德鲁・卡内基，the guy in the steel industry 钢铁行业. And it's important while you're reading to understand whether or not these people should be viewed as captains of industry 工业领袖 or robber barons 强盗大亨.

Key concepts 关键概念 for this time period: business practices done was something called horizontal integration 横向整合 -- make sure you know about that. And this is controlling all competition in a particular industry 控制特定行业的所有竞争 -- merging 合并 competing, for example, oil companies (Rockefeller did this) into one giant corporation 大型企业. And you want to consolidate 合并 all competitors 竞争对手 so you have no competition or very little competition so that you are able to monopolize the market 垄断市场. And so horizontal integration was done by these business leaders such as Rockefeller.

The other one is vertical integration 纵向整合，and this one is controlling all aspects of manufacturing 控制制造业的各个方面 from extracting the raw materials 提取原材料 to selling the finished product 销售成品. And the idea behind this business practice 商业策略 is you improve efficiency 提高效率 by making supplies much more reliable 使供应更可靠，you eliminate the middleman 消除中间商，and you're able to control all stages of production 控制生产的所有阶段. And this was done by Andrew Carnegie in the steel industry 钢铁行业. And these vertical integration strategies and horizontal integration strategies were very effective at increasing profits 增加利润 and eliminating competitors 淘汰竞争对手.

Now what happens during this time is you began to get these ideas about this changing society 变化中的社会 as people began to look for ways to explain the social order 社会秩序 of the Gilded Age. And remember, the key idea with regard to regulation in government 政府监管 was this idea of laissez-faire -- to leave alone, the government should not attempt to control or regulate business 政府不应试图控制或监管企业. And some individuals such as Herbert Spencer 赫伯特・斯宾塞 -- the "Social Darwinism" 社会达尔文主义 father figure 创始人 you see right there -- was an English social philosopher 社会哲学家，and he took Charles Darwin's ideas about the natural world 自然界 and applied them to the world of business 商业世界. And it's this idea of survival of the fittest 适者生存 -- that the wealthy were fit 适合生存的，hardworking 勤奋的，whereas the poor were just the weak in society 社会中的弱者 and therefore they should not be helped, and we should advocate for 倡导 laissez-faire.

There were other ideas -- for example, the Gospel of Wealth 财富福音论. There was a belief that the wealthy had a moral obligation 道德义务 to help out those who were less fortunate 不幸的人. And Andrew Carnegie advocated in the famous article called "Wealth" that the rich have a moral obligation to make it rain 大量捐钱 -- to donate to those individuals in need 通过捐赠给慈善机构、医院和公共图书馆等帮助有需要的人 by donating to charity and hospitals and public libraries and so on. And Carnegie is going to donate huge amounts of money to those different causes 事业.

In spite of 尽管 these different ideas, there was continuing to be a public outcry 公众强烈抗议 of the growing corporate power 不断增长的企业权力. And in 1890, you get a very very significant act of government regulation 政府监管法案 called the Sherman Antitrust Act 谢尔曼反托拉斯法. And this outlawed trusts 托拉斯 and other monopolies 垄断企业 that fixed prices 固定价格 or restrained trade 限制贸易. And once again, the government is going to be watching and monitoring business 政府将继续监管企业. Just like the Interstate Commerce Act though, in the beginning it's not very effective at regulating corporate power and abuse 监管企业权力和滥用行为. And in fact, the Sherman Antitrust Act is ironically 具有讽刺意味地 used against labor unions 工会 to break them up 解散工会 during this time period.

And that leads us to labor unions 工会. The labor movement 劳工运动 is going to challenge this pro-business climate 亲商环境. They're going to confront 对抗 corporate power 企业权力，but they're going to have a lot of challenges during this period as well. There was a division between skilled and unskilled workers 熟练工人和非熟练工人之间的分歧 -- you know, should you organize the skilled and unskilled together? There were ethnic and racial divisions 种族和民族分歧 -- very often labor unions were anti-Chinese immigrants 反华移民 and other groups. You had hostility from corporations 企业的敌意 and no protection by the government 政府不保护. In fact, scabs 工贼 -- replacement workers 顶替工人 -- were often brought in when workers went on strike 罢工. Court injunctions 法院禁令 were used to force workers back into the factory 迫使工人返回工厂. Yellow-dog contracts 黄狗合同 -- a worker had to agree to sign them and therefore they could not join a union 工人不得不签署合同从而不能加入工会. Blacklist 黑名单 -- if you were involved in the movement 参与运动，you were banned from working in certain industries 被禁止在某些行业工作. And public opinion 公众舆论 was very often against unions because they were often times viewed as being radical 激进的.

In spite of these challenges, you're going to see the growth of the national labor movement 全国劳工运动的发展. You see the National Labor Union 全国劳工联盟 formed in 1866. They're the first attempt to organize workers in all the different states 首次尝试组织各州工人. They demand things like higher wages 更高工资 and an 8-hour workday 八小时工作制，but they're going to have trouble sustaining that movement 维持该运动. The Knights of Labor 劳工骑士团 is also one you should know about -- 1869, Terence Powderly opened the union to all workers 向所有工人开放工会 -- skilled and unskilled workers. This was unique 独特的 and also included women and African-Americans in the movement 包括女性和非裔美国人. They're going to decline 衰落 following the Haymarket riot 干草市场骚乱 in 1886 -- we'll take a look at that in a second.

And the most important one is the American Federation of Labor 美国劳工联合会 in 1886. Samuel Gompers 塞缪尔・冈珀斯 -- under the leadership of Samuel Gompers -- they're going to focus on skilled workers 专注于熟练工人，and they're going to focus really not on social issues 社会问题 but what are known as "bread and butter" issues 实际问题 -- issues such as wages and working conditions 工资和工作条件. So none of that social stuff that the Knights of Labor was famous for 不像劳工骑士团关注的社会问题. And by 1900, they will be the largest labor union in the nation 全国最大的工会，but they will have limited success in the beginning 初期成功有限.

There's going to be a lot of examples of labor unrest 劳工动荡 throughout the country, and you're going to see that on this map -- all those areas in pink, there were some sort of strikes 罢工 happening. And some major ones you should know about for APUSH: the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 1877 年大铁路罢工 -- Rutherford B. Hayes eventually sends in the federal troops 派遣联邦军队 to end the labor unrest 结束劳工动荡. In 1886, there's the famous Haymarket bombing 干草市场爆炸事件 where a bomb explodes during a public meeting 在一次公开会议期间炸弹爆炸 in Haymarket Square near Chicago. And although it was the work of radical anarchists 激进无政府主义者，a bunch of people end up getting arrested 许多人被捕，and the public views the labor union as a whole as a radical and violent movement 公众认为整个工会是激进和暴力的运动. And so that suffers -- labor unions suffer a setback 遭受挫折 during this event.

And of course, Homestead Strike 1892 1892 年霍姆斯特德罢工 -- Henry Clay Frick uses a lockout 关闭工厂，private security guards known as Pinkertons 平克顿私家保安，and scabs 工贼 to defeat steel workers at Andrew Carnegie's factory 击败安德鲁・卡内基工厂的钢铁工人. And we'll talk about the Pullman Strike 普尔曼罢工 and Eugene Debs 尤金・德布斯 in another lecture. So make sure you understand how workers responded to this changing industrial economy 工人如何应对变化的工业经济 and how business leaders justified their wealth 企业领袖.

各位APUSH的同学们，大家好！今天我们要探讨工业革命，大致是从内战一直到1900年。关于工业革命，有几件事需要了解：到1900年，美国将成为世界领先的工业强国。这将是美国社会经济的快速转型，并将在经济、社会和政治上影响这个国家。实际上，制造业将取代农业成为经济增长的主要来源。由于大企业的崛起，你们将看到大规模的移民——大量的移民涌入，美国国内的人口也在流动——以及城市化——人们涌向城市。

而这一切的关键在于大量的发明和创新正在发生，这使得生产力大大提高。这一时期涌现了大量的新发明，并颁发了大量的专利。结果，一些关键的发明包括：亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔发明了电话，托马斯·爱迪生在门洛帕克进行了包括电灯在内的所有发明，这使得新的变革得以发生，因为这些发明和创新将改变日常生活。它们将为人们创造新的就业机会，并产生社会影响。你们可以在右边的图片中看到，女性作为接待员、秘书和公司内的其他职位进入劳动力市场。

现在，这个时代的首要大企业将是铁路，内战后铁路产量大幅增加。这实际上是联邦政府向铁路公司提供土地和贷款补贴的结果。这个时期在监管公司方面是自由放任的，但政府非常亲商，也非常亲铁路，因为他们基本上是在给铁路公司提供土地。政府这样做是因为他们希望这将增加西部联邦土地的价值，他们希望在运送联邦邮件或向西部运输军队方面获得优惠价格。

你们看到铁路公司获得了所有这些土地，而这些贷款将确立新的商业惯例，例如建立现代股东公司、企业管理策略、新的融资方式以及竞争监管。你们将看到铁路业的巨大发展。随之而来的是合并——意味着越来越少的铁路公司控制着市场——这也将导致行业的标准化。例如，钢轨——向钢轨的过渡——以及标准化轨距（轨道之间的宽度）——这是提高效率的关键。

由于铁路的增长，你们还看到了大量人口向密西西比河以西地区迁移，我们将在另一讲中讨论这个问题。但铁路时代与大平原的定居同时发生。这个故事的关键是第一条横贯大陆铁路。如果你们还记得，它实际上是在内战期间由国会中的共和党人通过《太平洋铁路法案》建立的。他们允许确定路线，联邦政府将在这个过程中提供帮助。这在内战结束后开始。

他们将任务分配给两家公司——蓝线是联合太平洋铁路公司，他们将从内布拉斯加州的奥马哈向西修建，主要由爱尔兰工人、前内战老兵组成。另一家是中央太平洋铁路公司，他们将从萨克拉门托穿越内华达山脉非常困难的地形修建，他们将大量依赖中国劳工来完成这项非常艰巨的工作。重要的时刻发生在1869年的普罗蒙特里角，两家公司在那里会合，铺下了象征第一条横贯大陆铁路完工的金色道钉。

这将产生巨大的影响。铁路的建设将产生巨大的影响。它将统一国内市场，为商品创造一个全国性市场。它允许原材料和制成品从东海岸到西海岸的大规模分销。它将鼓励大规模生产、大规模消费和经济专业化——全国不同的地区将专门生产某些产品。最后，它将有助于促进其他产业（例如煤炭、钢铁等）的增长，并导致新城市的崛起。如果你的城市靠近火车站，你将会因此获得巨大的发展。它将促进国内和国际移民，并将改变美国人的生活。事实上，美国铁路协会在1883年将全国划分为四个时区，以便提高效率，后来政府也采用了这种做法。

现在我们遇到了一个问题，因为铁路行业存在大量的腐败和不当行为。如果你们还记得之前的讲座，“信贷移动公司”丑闻——铁路公司贿赂政府官员。而这些铁路大亨变得极其强大。像科尼利厄斯·范德比尔特这样的人积累了巨额财富。结果，联邦土地赠予和优惠贷款导致腐败渗入政府。你们将看到频繁的投机泡沫，导致过度建设，而过度建设将导致经济混乱。投机者试图向公众出售高估的股票。结果，这种过度建设导致公司频繁破产。

管理不善和欺诈困扰着这个行业。回扣或折扣经常给予受优待的托运人，因此存在各种不同的定价。结果，小农户经常被收取比其他人更高的费用，他们将成为强大的铁路公司的受害者。并且创建了“联营”——“联营”是公司之间秘密达成的固定价格和分享利润的协议——因此实际上并没有公平竞争。由于人们对铁路公司对公众和政府的权力感到担忧，开始讨论政府是否应该监管。开始出现要求政府干预的呼声。

记住，当时的主流哲学是自由放任——放任不管，不进行监管。但农民成为呼吁改革的最强音。实际上，你们在“谷物协会运动”中看到了这一点——我们将在另一段视频中讨论这个问题。“谷物协会运动”是一个农民组织，要求变革，他们获得了一些监管措施。在1877年著名的“芒诉伊利诺伊州案”中，法院裁定州可以监管商业。然而，“芒诉伊利诺伊州案”——那些所谓的“谷物法”——在“沃巴什案”中被推翻，当时法院裁定各州不能监管州际贸易。而州际贸易是不同州之间的贸易。

公众开始要求联邦政府采取行动来改革镀金时代的资本主义体系，1887年通过了《州际商务法》。它做了几件事：它设立了州际商务委员会——联邦政府将监督商业。他们将禁止联营、回扣和价格固定。而公司——铁路公司——必须公布价格。现在州际商务委员会很重要。这是联邦政府首次大规模尝试为了整个社会的利益而监管商业。所以政府现在正在关注和监督商业。

重要的是要记住：州际商务委员会最初效果不佳，直到20世纪初的进步运动时期，你们才会看到更有效的监管措施得以实施。

在此期间，你们还看到了其他产业的崛起——重工业。铁路只是其中之一，还有石油、钢铁和煤炭。你们绝对应该了解的两个人物是标准石油公司的约翰·D·洛克菲勒和钢铁行业的安德鲁·卡内基。重要的是，在阅读时要理解这些人是否应该被视为产业巨头还是强盗贵族。

这个时期的关键概念：商业惯例中有一种叫做横向整合——务必了解这一点。这是控制特定行业的所有竞争——例如，将竞争的石油公司（洛克菲勒就是这样做的）合并成一家巨型公司。你们想要整合所有竞争对手，以便没有竞争或竞争很少，从而能够垄断市场。因此，像洛克菲勒这样的商业领袖就进行了横向整合。

另一种是纵向整合，这是控制从原材料开采到成品销售的所有生产环节。这种商业惯例背后的理念是通过使供应更加可靠、消除中间商以及能够控制所有生产阶段来提高效率。安德鲁·卡内基在钢铁行业就是这样做的。这些纵向整合策略和横向整合策略在增加利润和消灭竞争对手方面非常有效。

现在，在此期间发生的事情是，随着人们开始寻找解释镀金时代社会秩序的方法，你们开始形成关于这个变革社会的想法。记住，关于政府监管的关键理念是自由放任——放任不管，政府不应该试图控制或监管商业。一些人，比如赫伯特·斯宾塞——你们在那里看到的“社会达尔文主义”之父——是一位英国社会哲学家，他将查尔斯·达尔文关于自然界的思想应用于商业世界。这就是适者生存的思想——富人是强壮的、勤奋的，而穷人只是社会中的弱者，因此不应该帮助他们，我们应该倡导自由放任。

还有其他一些想法——例如，财富福音。当时有一种信念，认为富人有道义上的责任去帮助那些不幸的人。安德鲁·卡内基在著名的文章《财富》中主张，富人有道义上的责任“下钱雨”——通过捐赠给慈善机构、医院和公共图书馆等方式来捐助那些有需要的人。卡内基将向这些不同的事业捐赠巨额资金。

尽管有这些不同的想法，公众对不断增长的企业权力仍然持续不满。1890年，你们看到了一项非常非常重要的政府监管法案，称为《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》。该法案取缔了固定价格或限制贸易的托拉斯和其他垄断组织。再一次，政府将关注和监督商业。但就像《州际商务法》一样，最初它在监管企业权力和滥用方面效果不佳。事实上，《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》具有讽刺意味地被用来对付劳工组织，以便在这一时期将其解散。

这就引出了劳工组织。劳工运动将挑战这种亲商氛围。他们将对抗企业权力，但他们在此期间也将面临许多挑战。熟练工人与非熟练工人之间存在分歧——你们知道，应该将熟练工人和非熟练工人组织在一起吗？存在民族和种族分裂——劳工组织经常反对中国移民和其他群体。你们面临着来自企业的敌意，而政府没有提供保护。事实上，当工人罢工时，经常会引入“工贼”——替代工人。法院的强制令被用来迫使工人回到工厂。“黄狗合同”——工人必须同意签署，因此他们不能加入工会。“黑名单”——如果你参与了劳工运动，你将被禁止在某些行业工作。公众舆论经常反对工会，因为他们经常被视为激进的。

尽管面临这些挑战，你们将看到全国劳工运动的发展。你们看到全国劳工联盟于1866年成立。这是首次尝试在所有不同州组织工人。他们要求提高工资和实行八小时工作制，但他们将难以维持这场运动。你们还应该了解劳工骑士团——1869年，特伦斯·鲍德利向所有工人（包括熟练和非熟练工人）开放了工会。这很独特，并且还将妇女和非裔美国人纳入了运动。在1886年的海马克特骚乱之后，他们的影响力将下降——我们稍后会讨论这个问题。

最重要的一个是1886年的美国劳工联合会。在塞缪尔·冈珀斯的领导下，他们将专注于熟练工人，并且他们将真正专注于非社会问题，而是所谓的“面包和黄油”问题——例如工资和工作条件等问题。因此，没有劳工骑士团闻名的那些社会问题。到1900年，他们将成为全国最大的工会，但他们最初的成功有限。

全国各地将出现许多劳工动荡的例子，你们可以在这张地图上看到——所有粉红色的区域都发生过某种罢工。你们应该了解一些APUSH的重要罢工：1877年的大铁路罢工——拉瑟福德·B·海斯最终派遣联邦军队结束了劳工动荡。1886年，发生了著名的海马克特广场爆炸案，一枚炸弹在芝加哥附近海马克特广场的一次公众集会上爆炸。尽管这是激进无政府主义者的所为，但许多人最终被捕，公众将整个工会视为一个激进和暴力的运动。因此，劳工组织在此事件中遭受了挫折。

当然，还有1892年的霍姆斯特德罢工——亨利·克莱·弗里克使用关闭工厂、聘请平克顿侦探事务所的私人保安以及招募工贼来击败安德鲁·卡内基工厂的钢铁工人。我们将在另一讲中讨论普尔曼罢工和尤金·德布斯。因此，务必理解工人如何应对这种不断变化的工业经济，以及商业领袖如何为他们的财富辩护。

What's going down, APUSH? Today we're going to look at the Industrial Revolution, roughly from the Civil War all the way up until 1900. A couple things to know about the Industrial Revolution: by 1900, America would become the leading industrial power in the world. It's going to be a rapid economic transformation of American society, and this is going to impact the country economically, socially, and politically. And really, manufacturing is going to replace agriculture as the primary source of economic growth. And as a result of this rise of big business, you're going to have massive migrations -- huge amounts of immigrants coming in, people moving within the United States as well -- as urbanization -- people moving to the cities.

And so key to this is there's a huge number of inventions and innovations taking place, and this allows for greater productivity. A large number of new inventions are developed during this period, and a huge number of patents are issued. And as a result, some of those key ones: Alexander Graham Bell introduces the telephone, Thomas Edison with all of his inventions at Menlo Park with the electric light, and this allows for new changes to take place because these inventions and innovations will change daily lives. They'll create new jobs for people and have social consequences. And you could see that in the image right there with women entering the workforce as receptionists, secretaries, and other positions within companies.

Now the first big business in this era is going to be the railroads, and there's a huge increase of railroad production after the Civil War. And it is really the result of land and loan subsidies given by the federal government to the railroad companies. This period was a period of laissez-faire when it comes to regulating companies, but the government is very pro-business and very much pro-railroad because they're basically hooking them up with land. And the government's going to do this because they're going to hope that this is going to increase the value of federal land out in the west, and they're hoping to get preferred rates for the carrying of federal mail or to transport troops out in the west.

And what you see is the railroad companies getting all this land, and these loans are going to establish new business practices such as establishing the modern stockholder corporation, business management strategies, new ways of financing, and the regulation of competition. And you're going to see the railroad grow tremendously. And with that, you're going to have consolidation -- meaning fewer and fewer railroad companies are controlling the market -- which is also going to lead to standardization of the industry. For instance, the steel rail -- the transition to the steel rail -- and standardizing gauges, the width between the track -- this is key to allow for greater efficiency.

As a result of the growth of the railroad, you also have this huge movement of people out into the trans-Mississippi West, and we're going to cover that in another lecture. But this age of railroads is happening at the same time as the settlement of the Great Plains. And key to this story is the first transcontinental railroad. And if you recall, it was established actually during the Civil War by Republicans in Congress with the Pacific Railroad Act. They allowed for the route being established, and the federal government is going to help out in this process. And this gets started after the Civil War is over.

And they're going to divide the task between -- the blue line is going to be the Union Pacific, and they're going to build from Omaha, Nebraska to the west, and largely Irish workers, former Civil War veterans. And the other crew is going to be the Central Pacific company, and they're going to be building from Sacramento through the very difficult terrain of the Sierra Nevadas, and they're going to have a huge reliance on Chinese laborers to do that very difficult work. And the big moment comes in 1869 at Promontory Point when the two companies meet, and the golden spike is laid marking the completion of the first transcontinental railroad.

And this is going to have huge consequences. The building of the railroads are going to have huge impacts. It's going to unify the domestic market, create a national market for goods. It allows for the mass distribution of raw materials and manufactured goods from coast to coast. It's going to encourage mass production, mass consumption, and economic specialization -- different parts of the country are going to be specializing on certain products. And finally, it's going to help promote the growth of other industries -- for example, coal, steel, etc. -- and lead to the growth of new cities. If your city's by a rail station, you're going to have a tremendous growth as a result. It's going to facilitate immigration both internally and externally, and it's going to change the lives of Americans. In fact, the American Railroad Association divided the country into four time zones in 1883 so that there could be greater efficiency, and later on the government would adopt that as well.

Now we got a problem here because there was a lot of corruption and wrongdoing in the railroad industry. If you remember from previous lectures, the Credit Mobilier scandal -- you had government officials being bribed by the railroad companies. And these railroad tycoons are becoming extremely powerful. People like Cornelius Vanderbilt are amassing huge amounts of wealth. And as a result, federal land grants and friendly loans led that corruption to seep into the government. You're going to have frequent speculative bubbles where you have overbuilding taking place, and that overbuilding will lead to economic chaos. Speculators are attempting to sell overvalued stock to the public. And as a result, this overbuilding leads to companies going bankrupt very frequently.

Mismanagement and fraud plagued the industry. Rebates or discounts were oftentimes given to favored shippers, so there was all sorts of different pricing. And as a result of this, small farmers were often charged higher rates than others, and they're going to be the victims of the powerful railroad companies. And pools were created -- and pools were secret agreements between the companies to fix rates and share profits -- so there really wasn't fair competition taking place. And as a result of this concern over the railroad's power over the public and the government, there began to be discussions about should the government regulate. There starts to be demands the government should intervene.

Now keep in mind the dominant philosophy of the time is laissez-faire -- leave alone, no regulation. But farmers become the most vocal group in calling for reform. And really, you see that in the Grange movement -- we're going to cover that in another video. But the Grange movement is an organization of farmers demanding change, and they get some regulations. In the famous case of Munn versus Illinois in 1877, the court rules the state could regulate business. However, Munn versus Illinois -- those Granger laws as they were called -- are overturned in the Wabash case when the Court ruled that states could not regulate interstate commerce. And interstate commerce is trade between different states.

And the public begins to demand that the federal government does something to overhaul the capitalist system during the Gilded Age, and you get the Interstate Commerce Act passed in 1887. And it does a couple of things: it sets up the Interstate Commerce Commission -- the federal government would oversee business. They would ban pooling, rebates, and rate fixing. And companies -- railroad companies -- had to publish rates. Now the Interstate Commerce Commission is important. It is the first large-scale attempt by the federal government to regulate business in the interest of society at large. So the government is watching and monitoring business now.

Important to keep in mind: the ICC was initially not very effective, and it would not be until the Progressive Movement later on at the early 20th century where you're going to see more effective regulations being put in place.

Now during this time, you also have the rise of other industries -- the heavy industries. Railroad is just one, but you have oil, steel, and coal as well. And kind of the two figures that you should definitely know about is John D. Rockefeller, the head of Standard Oil, and Andrew Carnegie, the guy in the steel industry. And it's important while you're reading to understand whether or not these people should be viewed as captains of industry or robber barons.

Key concepts for this time period: business practices done was something called horizontal integration -- make sure you know about that. And this is controlling all competition in a particular industry -- merging competing, for example, oil companies (Rockefeller did this) into one giant corporation. And you want to consolidate all competitors so you have no competition or very little competition so that you are able to monopolize the market. And so horizontal integration was done by these business leaders such as Rockefeller.

The other one is vertical integration, and this one is controlling all aspects of manufacturing from extracting the raw materials to selling the finished product. And the idea behind this business practice is you improve efficiency by making supplies much more reliable, you eliminate the middleman, and you're able to control all stages of production. And this was done by Andrew Carnegie in the steel industry. And these vertical integration strategies and horizontal integration strategies were very effective at increasing profits and eliminating competitors.

Now what happens during this time is you began to get these ideas about this changing society as people began to look for ways to explain the social order of the Gilded Age. And remember, the key idea with regard to regulation in government was this idea of laissez-faire -- to leave alone, the government should not attempt to control or regulate business. And some individuals such as Herbert Spencer -- the "Social Darwinism" father figure you see right there -- was an English social philosopher, and he took Charles Darwin's ideas about the natural world and applied them to the world of business. And it's this idea of survival of the fittest -- that the wealthy were fit, hardworking, whereas the poor were just the weak in society and therefore they should not be helped, and we should advocate for laissez-faire.

There were other ideas -- for example, the Gospel of Wealth. There was a belief that the wealthy had a moral obligation to help out those who were less fortunate. And Andrew Carnegie advocated in the famous article called "Wealth" that the rich have a moral obligation to make it rain -- to donate to those individuals in need by donating to charity and hospitals and public libraries and so on. And Carnegie is going to donate huge amounts of money to those different causes.

In spite of these different ideas, there was continuing to be a public outcry of the growing corporate power. And in 1890, you get a very very significant act of government regulation called the Sherman Antitrust Act. And this outlawed trusts and other monopolies that fixed prices or restrained trade. And once again, the government is going to be watching and monitoring business. Just like the Interstate Commerce Act though, in the beginning it's not very effective at regulating corporate power and abuse. And in fact, the Sherman Antitrust Act is ironically used against labor unions to break them up during this time period.

And that leads us to labor unions. The labor movement is going to challenge this pro-business climate. They're going to confront corporate power, but they're going to have a lot of challenges during this period as well. There was a division between skilled and unskilled workers -- you know, should you organize the skilled and unskilled together? There were ethnic and racial divisions -- very often labor unions were anti-Chinese immigrants and other groups. You had hostility from corporations and no protection by the government. In fact, scabs -- replacement workers -- were often brought in when workers went on strike. Court injunctions were used to force workers back into the factory. Yellow-dog contracts -- a worker had to agree to sign them and therefore they could not join a union. Blacklist -- if you were involved in the movement, you were banned from working in certain industries. And public opinion was very often against unions because they were often times viewed as being radical.

In spite of these challenges, you're going to see the growth of the national labor movement. You see the National Labor Union formed in 1866. They're the first attempt to organize workers in all the different states. They demand things like higher wages and an 8-hour workday, but they're going to have trouble sustaining that movement. The Knights of Labor is also one you should know about -- 1869, Terence Powderly opened the union to all workers -- skilled and unskilled workers. This was unique and also included women and African-Americans in the movement. They're going to decline following the Haymarket riot in 1886 -- we'll take a look at that in a second.

And the most important one is the American Federation of Labor in 1886. Samuel Gompers -- under the leadership of Samuel Gompers -- they're going to focus on skilled workers, and they're going to focus really not on social issues but what are known as "bread and butter" issues -- issues such as wages and working conditions. So none of that social stuff that the Knights of Labor was famous for. And by 1900, they will be the largest labor union in the nation, but they will have limited success in the beginning.

There's going to be a lot of examples of labor unrest throughout the country, and you're going to see that on this map -- all those areas in pink, there were some sort of strikes happening. And some major ones you should know about for APUSH: the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 -- Rutherford B. Hayes eventually sends in the federal troops to end the labor unrest. In 1886, there's the famous Haymarket bombing where a bomb explodes during a public meeting in Haymarket Square near Chicago. And although it was the work of radical anarchists, a bunch of people end up getting arrested, and the public views the labor union as a whole as a radical and violent movement. And so that suffers -- labor unions suffer a setback during this event.

And of course, Homestead Strike 1892 -- Henry Clay Frick uses a lockout, private security guards known as Pinkertons, and scabs to defeat steel workers at Andrew Carnegie's factory. And we'll talk about the Pullman Strike and Eugene Debs in another lecture. So make sure you understand how workers responded to this changing industrial economy and how business leaders justified their wealth.
