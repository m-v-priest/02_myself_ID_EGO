What's going down 发生；进行 everyone? Welcome back 欢迎回来. Today we're breaking down 分解；剖析 APUSH periods 1 through 5 -- 1491 to 1877. This is about 50% of the APUSH exam 考试 you're about to take in May.

So APUSH period 1 begins 1491. 1491 is selected because it's the year before Columbus got lost -- pre-Columbian exchange 哥伦布大交换. This time period is about 5% of the APUSH exam. You won't have to write an essay 论文 about it, but it will show up in the multiple choice 多项选择 section.

Some key things to know: You better know about these Native American life pre and post contact 接触. How did life change after Columbus landed in the New World 新大陆 in 1492? So some examples of this -- the Great Plains 大平原, the nomadic 游牧的 life amongst the native people, the introduction of diseases 疾病 and horses and guns and other things that is the result of the Columbian Exchange.

Another important thing to know about is European attempts at colonization 殖民化. How did Spain, France, Holland and England attempt to colonize 殖民 the Western Hemisphere 西半球? So know about like the Treaty of Tordesillas 托尔德西里亚斯条约 between Spain and Portugal, St. Augustine -- the first permanent 永久的 settlement 定居点 by Spain in North America -- and the encomienda system 监护征赋制 which Spain used in their colonization efforts. Those are some of the things.

You should also know about interactions 互动 and relationships between the Europeans, the Africans and the Native Americans. You're going to have the mestizos 混血儿 that are the result of interracial 跨种族的 relationships in the new world, the Middle Passage 中间航道 slave trade 奴隶贸易, Portugal and the Dutch going into West Africa and other things.

This time period -- period 1 -- ends in 1607, and that's important because 1607 is the first permanent English colony 殖民地 it gets founded at Jamestown, Virginia. So that leads us to period 2. It starts in 1607 with the establishment 建立 of Jamestown. This is 10% of the APUSH exam.

Some things you better know about are the success and failures of different European attempts at colonization. You should know about the interactions and the relationships in this time period as well between the Europeans, the Africans and Native Americans. So you know all these colonies are being formed because of mercantilism 重商主义. You have revolts 反抗 in New Spain -- the Pueblo Revolt 普韦布洛起义, King Philip's War 菲利普王战争 in the New England colonies, Bacon's Rebellion 培根起义 down in Virginia which leads to the transition 转变 of slavery, the Stono Rebellion 斯托诺起义 which is a slave revolt 奴隶起义 in colonial America and so on.

You should also make sure you know how did England become the dominant 主导的 power in North America? How did they end up winning what will become the United States? And why the English colonies develop unique 独特的 identities 身份认同? You got the New England colonies which were largely Puritan 清教徒 and religiously 宗教地 based motives 动机. You have the middle colonies like New York and Pennsylvania -- the so-called "Bread Basket 面包篮". The Chesapeake 切萨皮克 -- Virginia and Maryland. Then the Southern and the West Indies 西印度群岛 -- so you got South Carolina and Georgia which are largely based upon cash crop 经济作物 economies 经济.

This time period ends in 1754 with the start of the Seven Years' War 七年战争 in Europe or as it's called in the new world -- the French and Indian War 法国印第安人战争 -- which leads us to period 3. This is about 12% of the exam. It begins with the start of the French and Indian War. Remember George Washington goes into the Ohio Valley 俄亥俄河谷 and you have a war between England and France.

And really things you should know about for period 3: Why and how the French and Indian War was a major turning point 转折点 between England and the colonies. Remember this is the end of salutary neglect 有益的忽视 -- no more are the British going to be leaving the colonies alone. You're going to get taxes like the Stamp Act 印花税法案. You're going to get ideas from people like Thomas Paine in Common Sense 常识. And of course the ideas of the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 -- people like John Locke's ideas are coming to the English colonies and causing people to want slowly calls for independence 独立.

You should also know about the factors 因素 that contributed to the American Revolution 美国革命 and why the colonies were eventually victorious 胜利的. Make sure you know about the differences and the similarities between the Articles of Confederation 联邦条例 -- which is the first national government, it's very weak -- and the Constitution 宪法 which is our second national government and is a much more powerful national government.

So you know the Articles do the Northwest Ordinances 西北法令 -- you know which allows for the orderly 有序的 settlement of that region, ban slavery. You have Shay's Rebellion 谢斯起义 where the Articles can't stop this rebellion, and then that leads to calls for a new government. The Constitution is able to crush 镇压 the Whiskey Rebellion 威士忌叛乱. But the Constitution is only created as a result of the compromises 妥协 such as the 3/5ths compromise 五分之三妥协, the Great Compromise 大妥协.

Keep in mind the Constitution creates federalism 联邦制 -- you have a state and federal government with the federal government having supremacy 至高无上. And of course this is done with checks and balances 制衡 and separation of powers 权力分立 so that the government's not too powerful.

Also make sure you know about why political parties 政党 formed -- the first political parties the Federalists 联邦党 and the Jeffersonian Republicans 杰斐逊共和党. Why they form as a result of Hamilton's economic plan, the foreign policy 外交政策 things like French Revolution and how Washington warned the country in his farewell address 告别演说 -- stay away from entangling alliances 纠缠不清的联盟 and also political parties are not good.

Period 3 ends in 1800 with the election of Jefferson -- the first peaceful transition 和平过渡 of political power between different political parties. APUSH period 4 is 10% of the APUSH exam. It begins in 1800.

Things you should know about in this time period is why the different regions -- the North, the South, the West -- develop unique identities and how the Market Revolution 市场革命 impacted each region. So you have Eli Whitney with the cotton gin 轧棉机 and interchangeable parts 可互换零件. You have a transportation revolution 交通革命 creating new forms of transportation such as canals 运河 and roads. You have large scale 大规模的 immigration 移民 especially from Ireland and Germany, an increased nativism 本土主义. And of course in the South you have support for slavery and growing opposition 反对 to slavery in the North.

Another important thing when studying period 4 is how American society was becoming more democratic 民主的 -- at least for white dudes -- in the age of Jackson -- the age of the common man 普通人时代 -- and how various reform movements 改革运动 sought to improve American society. So during this time period you have the Abolitionist Movement 废奴运动 -- William Lloyd Garrison and others. You have a religious reform movement -- the Second Great Awakening 第二次大觉醒. Women are demanding greater equality at Seneca Falls 塞尼卡福尔斯. You have public education 公共教育 reform with Horace Mann and many many others.

The growth of political parties continues during this time period. We already mentioned the first party system -- the Federalist and the Democratic Republicans. They continue to develop and in this time period you also have the second party system which is really the Democrats and the Whigs 辉格党. So you should know about loose versus strict interpretation 解释 of the Constitution, the opposition to Jackson creates the Whig party and other things that led to this growth of political parties.

And of course period 4 would not be complete without understanding the growth of slavery issue. Really you know you see the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协案 as there's a debate about should Missouri be admitted to the Union as a slave state and how the movement West brought the issue of slavery into politics.

Keep in mind you should also know during this time period there are other issues that cause sectionalism 地方主义 such as the American System 美国体系 -- Henry Clay, the tariff 关税 issue in 1828 with the Tariff of Abominations 可憎关税 and the bank issue when Jackson decides he's going to take on the Bank of the United States and try to destroy it.

Finally in period 4 another thing to keep in mind is how states attempted to resist 抵抗 federal authority 联邦权威. You saw this during the War of 1812 with the Hartford Convention 哈特福德会议, the nullification crisis 废止危机 when the state of South Carolina tried to nullify 废止 the Tariff of 1828. But it's also important to keep in mind the supremacy of the federal government over the states is established during this time period. You see this with many of the Supreme Court cases under John Marshall during the Marshall Court -- Marbury versus Madison 马伯里诉麦迪逊案 and others.

Period 4 ends in 1848 with the Seneca Falls Convention -- that women's rights kind of movement milestone 里程碑. And period 5 begins in 1844 with the election of James K. Polk -- the guy who really represents the idea of manifest destiny 昭昭天命. Period 5 is 13% of the APUSH exam.

You better know about the belief in Manifest Destiny and the expansion 扩张 of the United States during this time period. We have the issue with Texas and the annexation 吞并 issue, the controversial 有争议的 war -- the Mexican-American War 美墨战争 -- and other examples of US expansion.

Make sure you know about the issue of slavery and how attempts at compromise ultimately failed to prevent the Civil War 内战. So key to this time is knowing about sectional tensions 地区紧张局势 of the time period such as the Wilmot Proviso 威尔莫特但书, the Compromise of 1850 1850年妥协案, the Kansas-Nebraska Act 堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案, Dred Scott 德雷德·斯科特案, the election of Lincoln. All of these create sectional tensions as well as other events.

You should know that the North won the Civil War due to a variety of factors -- great military leaders like Ulysses S. Grant, effective strategies 策略 such as the Anaconda Plan 蟒蛇计划, superior resources 资源 such as manufacturing 制造业, and key victories such as at Antietam 安提塔姆 and Gettysburg 葛底斯堡. And the war will have tremendous consequences 后果 for the nation -- it'll preserve the Union and of course the big one is the Emancipation Proclamation 解放宣言 will be the first step in freeing slaves.

And finally in period 5 -- in what ways can Reconstruction 重建 be considered a failure or a success? And really did the lives of African-American people dramatically improve after the Civil War? And the answer is not too much. You should know about the Reconstruction amendments 修正案 -- the 13th, the 14th and 15th Amendment. Radical Republicans 激进共和党人 calling for greater protections for the rights of African-Americans. However you should also know that the KKK 三K党 uses violence, Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法 start to be established and other things ultimately cause Reconstruction to fail.

Period 5 ends in 1877 and the reason for this is this is considered the end of Reconstruction with the Compromise of 1877 1877年妥协案 with the election of Rutherford B. Hayes.

All of these are just some key ideas to review. If you want to get way more information, click on any one of these review videos for additional help. We got your back here at Joe's Productions. And as you can see right there Abraham Lincoln's pouring out some orange juice for all the homies and APUSH that didn't make it to the end. But you have. So click like on the video, tell your friends about the channel. If you haven't done so, subscribe and get a 5 in May. Peace.

大家好！欢迎回来。今天我们将细分APUSH的第1至第5时期——1491年至1877年。这大约占你们五月份即将参加的APUSH考试的50%。

APUSH的第一时期始于1491年。选择1491年是因为这是哥伦布迷路的前一年——前哥伦布时期。这个时期约占APUSH考试的5%。你们不必写一篇关于它的文章，但它会出现在多项选择题部分。

一些需要了解的关键点：你们最好了解接触前后美洲原住民的生活。1492年哥伦布在新大陆登陆后，生活发生了怎样的变化？一些例子——大平原，当地居民的游牧生活，疾病、马匹、枪支以及哥伦布大交换带来的其他事物的引入。

另一个需要了解的重要事项是欧洲殖民的尝试。西班牙、法国、荷兰和英国是如何尝试殖民西半球的？了解西班牙和葡萄牙之间的《托尔德西拉斯条约》，西班牙在北美洲的第一个永久定居点圣奥古斯丁，以及西班牙在其殖民努力中使用的恩科米enda制度。这些都是需要了解的一些事情。

你们还应该了解欧洲人、非洲人和美洲原住民之间的互动和关系。你们将了解新世界中跨种族关系产生的混血人种（mestizos），中程航道奴隶贸易，葡萄牙人和荷兰人进入西非等等。

第一时期——这个时期——于1607年结束，这一点很重要，因为1607年英国在弗吉尼亚州詹姆斯敦建立了第一个永久性殖民地。这使我们进入第二时期。它始于1607年詹姆斯敦的建立。这占APUSH考试的10%。

你们最好了解的一些事情是欧洲不同殖民尝试的成功与失败。你们还应该了解这一时期欧洲人、非洲人和美洲原住民之间的互动和关系。你们知道所有这些殖民地都是由于重商主义而形成的。新西班牙发生了叛乱——普韦布洛起义（Pueblo Revolt），新英格兰殖民地发生了菲利普国王战争（King Philip's War），弗吉尼亚州南部发生了导致奴隶制转变的培根叛乱（Bacon's Rebellion），殖民地美国发生了斯托诺叛乱（Stono Rebellion）等等。

你们还应该确保了解英国是如何成为北美洲的 dominant power 的？他们是如何最终赢得将成为美国的领土的？以及为什么英国殖民地发展出独特的身份？你们有主要由清教徒和宗教动机驱动的新英格兰殖民地。你们有像纽约和宾夕法尼亚这样的中部殖民地——所谓的“面包篮子”。切萨皮克——弗吉尼亚和马里兰。然后是南部和西印度群岛——所以你们有主要基于经济作物的南卡罗来纳州和乔治亚州。

这个时期于1754年结束，标志着欧洲七年战争的开始，或者在新世界被称为法国和印第安人战争，这使我们进入第三时期。这约占考试的12%。它始于法国和印第安人战争的开始。记住，乔治·华盛顿进入俄亥俄河谷，英国和法国之间爆发了战争。

第三时期你们真正应该了解的是：为什么以及如何法国和印第安人战争成为英国和殖民地之间的一个主要转折点。记住，这是“有益的忽视”的结束——英国人不再会放任殖民地不管了。你们将面临像《印花税法案》（Stamp Act）这样的税收。你们将从像托马斯·潘恩在《常识》（Common Sense）中的人那里获得思想。当然，启蒙运动的思想——像约翰·洛克的思想正在传入英国殖民地，并逐渐导致人们想要独立。

你们还应该了解导致美国革命的因素以及为什么殖民地最终获胜。确保你们了解第一个全国性政府——邦联条例（Articles of Confederation，非常软弱）和第二个全国性政府——宪法（Constitution，一个强大得多的全国性政府）之间的异同。

你们知道邦联条例制定了西北法令（Northwest Ordinances）——你们知道这允许该地区的有序定居，禁止奴隶制。你们有谢司叛乱（Shay's Rebellion），邦联条例无法阻止这场叛乱，然后这导致了对新政府的呼吁。宪法能够镇压威士忌叛乱（Whiskey Rebellion）。但宪法只是作为妥协的结果而产生的，例如五分之三妥协（3/5ths compromise）和大妥协（Great Compromise）。

记住，宪法确立了联邦制——你们有一个州政府和一个联邦政府，联邦政府拥有至上地位。当然，这是通过制衡和权力分立来实现的，以防止政府权力过大。

还要确保你们了解为什么会形成政党——第一个政党是联邦党（Federalists）和杰斐逊共和党（Jeffersonian Republicans）。它们形成的原因是汉密尔顿的经济计划，以及像法国大革命这样的外交政策，以及华盛顿在他的告别演说中警告国家——远离卷入的联盟，而且政党不好。

第三时期于1800年杰斐逊当选总统结束——这是不同政党之间第一次和平的政治权力过渡。APUSH的第四时期占APUSH考试的10%。它始于1800年。

你们应该了解的这个时期的事情是，为什么不同的地区——北方、南方、西部——发展出独特的身份，以及市场革命（Market Revolution）如何影响每个地区。你们有伊莱·惠特尼的轧棉机和可互换零件。你们有交通革命，创造了新的交通方式，如运河和道路。你们有大规模的移民，特别是来自爱尔兰和德国，本土主义情绪日益高涨。当然，在南方，你们有对奴隶制的支持，而在北方，对奴隶制的反对日益增长。

研究第四时期的另一个重要方面是，在美国杰克逊时代——平民时代——美国社会是如何变得更加民主的（至少对白人男性而言），以及各种改革运动是如何寻求改善美国社会的。在这个时期，你们有废奴运动——威廉·劳埃德·加里森等人。你们有宗教改革运动——第二次大觉醒（Second Great Awakening）。妇女在塞内卡瀑布（Seneca Falls）要求更大的平等。你们有霍勒斯·曼（Horace Mann）和其他许多人进行的公共教育改革。

政党的发展在这个时期继续进行。我们已经提到了第一个政党体系——联邦党和民主共和党。它们继续发展，在这个时期你们还有第二个政党体系，实际上是民主党（Democrats）和辉格党（Whigs）。因此，你们应该了解对宪法的宽松解释与严格解释之争，对杰克逊的反对催生了辉格党，以及导致政党发展的其他因素。

当然，如果不了解奴隶制问题的增长，第四时期就不完整。你们知道，由于密苏里是否应作为蓄奴州加入联邦的辩论，你们看到了密苏里妥协案（Missouri Compromise），以及西进运动如何将奴隶制问题带入政治。

记住，你们还应该了解在这个时期导致地区主义的其他问题，例如美国体系（American System）——亨利·克莱，1828年的“可憎关税”（Tariff of Abominations）引发的关税问题，以及杰克逊决定对抗美国银行并试图摧毁它时引发的银行问题。

最后，在第四时期，另一个需要记住的是各州是如何试图抵抗联邦权威的。你们在1812年战争期间的哈特福德会议（Hartford Convention）和南卡罗来纳州试图废除1828年关税时的废除危机（nullification crisis）中看到了这一点。但同样重要的是要记住，联邦政府对各州的至上地位在这个时期得以确立。你们在马歇尔法院时期约翰·马歇尔领导下的许多最高法院案件中看到了这一点——马伯里诉麦迪逊案（Marbury v. Madison）等等。

第四时期于1848年塞内卡瀑布会议结束——那是妇女权利运动的一个里程碑事件。第五时期始于1844年詹姆斯·K·波尔克（James K. Polk）当选总统——他真正代表了昭昭天命（manifest destiny）的思想。第五时期占APUSH考试的13%。

你们最好了解昭昭天命的信念以及美国在这个时期的扩张。我们有德克萨斯问题和吞并问题，有争议的战争——美墨战争——以及美国扩张的其他例子。

确保你们了解奴隶制问题以及妥协的尝试最终未能阻止内战。因此，这个时期的关键在于了解当时的地区紧张局势，例如威尔莫特但书（Wilmot Proviso）、1850年妥协案（Compromise of 1850）、堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案（Kansas-Nebraska Act）、德雷德·斯科特案（Dred Scott）、林肯的当选。所有这些以及其他事件都造成了地区紧张局势。

你们应该知道，由于多种因素，北方赢得了内战——尤利西斯·S·格兰特等伟大的军事将领，像安纳aconda计划这样的有效战略，像制造业这样的优越资源，以及像安提耶塔姆（Antietam）和葛底斯堡（Gettysburg）这样的关键胜利。这场战争将对国家产生巨大的影响——它将维护联邦，当然最重要的是《解放奴隶宣言》（Emancipation Proclamation）将是解放奴隶的第一步。

最后，在第五时期——重建在哪些方面可以被认为是失败或成功的？内战后非裔美国人的生活是否发生了巨大的改善？答案是否定的。你们应该了解重建修正案——第13、14和15修正案。激进共和党人呼吁加强对非裔美国人权利的保护。然而，你们也应该知道三K党使用暴力，吉姆·克劳法开始建立，以及其他最终导致重建失败的事情。

第五时期于1877年结束，原因是这被认为是随着1877年妥协案和拉瑟福德·B·海耶斯（Rutherford B. Hayes）的当选而标志着重建的结束。

所有这些只是一些需要复习的关键思想。如果你们想获得更多信息，请点击任何一个复习视频以获得额外的帮助。乔的制作在这里支持你们。正如你们在那里看到的，亚伯拉罕·林肯正在为所有未能坚持到最后的伙伴和APUSH考生倒橙汁。但你们坚持下来了。所以请点赞这个视频，告诉你们的朋友这个频道。如果你们还没有这样做，请订阅，并在五月份获得5分。再见。

What's going down everyone? Welcome back. Today we're breaking down APUSH periods 1 through 5 -- 1491 to 1877. This is about 50% of the APUSH exam you're about to take in May.

So APUSH period 1 begins 1491. 1491 is selected because it's the year before Columbus got lost -- pre-Columbian exchange. This time period is about 5% of the APUSH exam. You won't have to write an essay about it, but it will show up in the multiple choice section.

Some key things to know: You better know about these Native American life pre and post contact. How did life change after Columbus landed in the New World in 1492? So some examples of this -- the Great Plains, the nomadic life amongst the native people, the introduction of diseases and horses and guns and other things that is the result of the Columbian Exchange.

Another important thing to know about is European attempts at colonization. How did Spain, France, Holland and England attempt to colonize the Western Hemisphere? So know about like the Treaty of Tordesillas between Spain and Portugal, St. Augustine -- the first permanent settlement by Spain in North America -- and the encomienda system which Spain used in their colonization efforts. Those are some of the things.

You should also know about interactions and relationships between the Europeans, the Africans and the Native Americans. You're going to have the mestizos that are the result of interracial relationships in the new world, the Middle Passage slave trade, Portugal and the Dutch going into West Africa and other things.

This time period -- period 1 -- ends in 1607, and that's important because 1607 is the first permanent English colony it gets founded at Jamestown, Virginia. So that leads us to period 2. It starts in 1607 with the establishment of Jamestown. This is 10% of the APUSH exam.

Some things you better know about are the success and failures of different European attempts at colonization. You should know about the interactions and the relationships in this time period as well between the Europeans, the Africans and Native Americans. So you know all these colonies are being formed because of mercantilism. You have revolts in New Spain -- the Pueblo Revolt, King Philip's War in the New England colonies, Bacon's Rebellion down in Virginia which leads to the transition of slavery, the Stono Rebellion which is a slave revolt in colonial America and so on.

You should also make sure you know how did England become the dominant power in North America? How did they end up winning what will become the United States? And why the English colonies develop unique identities? You got the New England colonies which were largely Puritan and religiously based motives. You have the middle colonies like New York and Pennsylvania -- the so-called "Bread Basket." The Chesapeake -- Virginia and Maryland. Then the Southern and the West Indies -- so you got South Carolina and Georgia which are largely based upon cash crop economies.

This time period ends in 1754 with the start of the Seven Years' War in Europe or as it's called in the new world -- the French and Indian War -- which leads us to period 3. This is about 12% of the exam. It begins with the start of the French and Indian War. Remember George Washington goes into the Ohio Valley and you have a war between England and France.

And really things you should know about for period 3: Why and how the French and Indian War was a major turning point between England and the colonies. Remember this is the end of salutary neglect -- no more are the British going to be leaving the colonies alone. You're going to get taxes like the Stamp Act. You're going to get ideas from people like Thomas Paine in Common Sense. And of course the ideas of the Enlightenment -- people like John Locke's ideas are coming to the English colonies and causing people to want slowly calls for independence.

You should also know about the factors that contributed to the American Revolution and why the colonies were eventually victorious. Make sure you know about the differences and the similarities between the Articles of Confederation -- which is the first national government, it's very weak -- and the Constitution which is our second national government and is a much more powerful national government.

So you know the Articles do the Northwest Ordinances -- you know which allows for the orderly settlement of that region, ban slavery. You have Shay's Rebellion where the Articles can't stop this rebellion, and then that leads to calls for a new government. The Constitution is able to crush the Whiskey Rebellion. But the Constitution is only created as a result of the compromises such as the 3/5ths compromise, the Great Compromise.

Keep in mind the Constitution creates federalism -- you have a state and federal government with the federal government having supremacy. And of course this is done with checks and balances and separation of powers so that the government's not too powerful.

Also make sure you know about why political parties formed -- the first political parties the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans. Why they form as a result of Hamilton's economic plan, the foreign policy things like French Revolution and how Washington warned the country in his farewell address -- stay away from entangling alliances and also political parties are not good.

Period 3 ends in 1800 with the election of Jefferson -- the first peaceful transition of political power between different political parties. APUSH period 4 is 10% of the APUSH exam. It begins in 1800.

Things you should know about in this time period is why the different regions -- the North, the South, the West -- develop unique identities and how the Market Revolution impacted each region. So you have Eli Whitney with the cotton gin and interchangeable parts. You have a transportation revolution creating new forms of transportation such as canals and roads. You have large scale immigration especially from Ireland and Germany, an increased nativism. And of course in the South you have support for slavery and growing opposition to slavery in the North.

Another important thing when studying period 4 is how American society was becoming more democratic -- at least for white dudes -- in the age of Jackson -- the age of the common man -- and how various reform movements sought to improve American society. So during this time period you have the Abolitionist Movement -- William Lloyd Garrison and others. You have a religious reform movement -- the Second Great Awakening. Women are demanding greater equality at Seneca Falls. You have public education reform with Horace Mann and many many others.

The growth of political parties continues during this time period. We already mentioned the first party system -- the Federalist and the Democratic Republicans. They continue to develop and in this time period you also have the second party system which is really the Democrats and the Whigs. So you should know about loose versus strict interpretation of the Constitution, the opposition to Jackson creates the Whig party and other things that led to this growth of political parties.

And of course period 4 would not be complete without understanding the growth of slavery issue. Really you know you see the Missouri Compromise as there's a debate about should Missouri be admitted to the Union as a slave state and how the movement West brought the issue of slavery into politics.

Keep in mind you should also know during this time period there are other issues that cause sectionalism such as the American System -- Henry Clay, the tariff issue in 1828 with the Tariff of Abominations and the bank issue when Jackson decides he's going to take on the Bank of the United States and try to destroy it.

Finally in period 4 another thing to keep in mind is how states attempted to resist federal authority. You saw this during the War of 1812 with the Hartford Convention, the nullification crisis when the state of South Carolina tried to nullify the Tariff of 1828. But it's also important to keep in mind the supremacy of the federal government over the states is established during this time period. You see this with many of the Supreme Court cases under John Marshall during the Marshall Court -- Marbury versus Madison and others.

Period 4 ends in 1848 with the Seneca Falls Convention -- that women's rights kind of movement milestone. And period 5 begins in 1844 with the election of James K. Polk -- the guy who really represents the idea of manifest destiny. Period 5 is 13% of the APUSH exam.

You better know about the belief in Manifest Destiny and the expansion of the United States during this time period. We have the issue with Texas and the annexation issue, the controversial war -- the Mexican-American War -- and other examples of US expansion.

Make sure you know about the issue of slavery and how attempts at compromise ultimately failed to prevent the Civil War. So key to this time is knowing about sectional tensions of the time period such as the Wilmot Proviso, the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Dred Scott, the election of Lincoln. All of these create sectional tensions as well as other events.

You should know that the North won the Civil War due to a variety of factors -- great military leaders like Ulysses S. Grant, effective strategies such as the Anaconda Plan, superior resources such as manufacturing, and key victories such as at Antietam and Gettysburg. And the war will have tremendous consequences for the nation -- it'll preserve the Union and of course the big one is the Emancipation Proclamation will be the first step in freeing slaves.

And finally in period 5 -- in what ways can Reconstruction be considered a failure or a success? And really did the lives of African-American people dramatically improve after the Civil War? And the answer is not too much. You should know about the Reconstruction amendments -- the 13th, the 14th and 15th Amendment. Radical Republicans calling for greater protections for the rights of African-Americans. However you should also know that the KKK uses violence, Jim Crow laws start to be established and other things ultimately cause Reconstruction to fail.

Period 5 ends in 1877 and the reason for this is this is considered the end of Reconstruction with the Compromise of 1877 with the election of Rutherford B. Hayes.

All of these are just some key ideas to review. If you want to get way more information, click on any one of these review videos for additional help. We got your back here at Joe's Productions. And as you can see right there Abraham Lincoln's pouring out some orange juice for all the homies and APUSH that didn't make it to the end. But you have.
