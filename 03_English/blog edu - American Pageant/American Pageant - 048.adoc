What up APUSH people? 怎么了，美国历史课程（APUSH）的同学们？Today we're going to take a look at 看一看 period 5 key concept 5.3, and this is really the Civil War 内战 and reconstruction 重建. An important thing to keep in mind is the reasons the Union 联邦（指北方）wins the war, because in the beginning the Confederacy 邦联（指南方）has some early success. They win the Battle of Bull Run 布尔朗战役 which proves the war is not going to be over in 90 days. The Peninsula Campaign 半岛战役 is a defeat 失败 for the Union, and there's some advantages the South has going into this war. They're fighting a defensive war 防御战 -- all they have to do is not lose. They're fighting amongst a friendly population 友好的民众. They have a sense of purpose 目标感 -- they're fighting for their Southern way of life as they see it, defending slavery 奴隶制, defending states' rights 州权 against what they feel is an abusive federal government 滥用权力的联邦政府. They also have many of the veteran military officials 资深军事官员 -- many of the big-time military leaders like Robert E. Lee join the Confederacy when the war begins.

But the North slowly gets it together, and largely it's going to be their greater industrial resources 工业资源. They have the manufacturing capacity 制造能力 that the South does not. They have more manpower 人力 which means more soldiers to fight in the battles. As the war drags on 拖延, they're going to use the Navy to implement military strategies 实施军事战略 such as the Anaconda Plan 安aconda计划 with a blockade 封锁 and eventually trying to strangle 扼杀 the South into submission 屈服. And as the war goes on, military leaders are going to emerge 涌现 in the Union like William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant. And you're going to have some key victories 关键胜利 as the war drags on.

1862 you have Antietam 安提塔姆战役, and it's really a military draw 军事平局 but it prevents foreign intervention 外国干预 on the side of the Confederacy. England and France because the South doesn't win that battle kind of rethink this idea of giving them recognition 承认 or help, and it also leads to Lincoln announcing the Emancipation Proclamation 解放宣言. Gettysburg 葛底斯堡战役 is another one you should keep in mind -- it stops the Confederate attack on Union soil 在联邦领土上 in Pennsylvania. And right at the same time is the Battle of Vicksburg 维克斯堡战役 where Ulysses S. Grant wins control of the Mississippi River 密西西比河 for the Union. And Sherman's March to the Sea 谢尔曼进军大海 and the fall of Atlanta 亚特兰大沦陷 in 1864 -- William Tecumseh Sherman leads a march of deliberate destruction 蓄意破坏 throughout the South, and this is part of the Union strategy of total war 总体战. You destroy the Southern environment and its infrastructure 基础设施, and eventually they will surrender 投降.

And a big thing to keep in mind is after Antietam, the war is changed to one not just about stopping secession 分裂 but also stopping slavery, and that gives the Union an advantage militarily 军事上 as well as ideologically 意识形态上. Both sides -- both the Union and the Confederacy -- are going to mobilize 动员 their economies and societies for war. Both the Union and the Confederacy are going to adopt conscription laws 征兵法 -- draft laws 征兵法 -- as men are needed for the fighting. And these in both the North and the South were unfair to the poor. In the North there was these $300 men where you could hire substitutes 替代者 to do the fighting for you. And in the South you have the so-called 20 Negro Law where if you own more than 20 slaves you were exempt from 免除 having to fight. As a result of this unfairness -- a rich man's war but a poor man's fight -- was the same. You have draft riots 征兵暴动, the most famous ones being in July of 1863 in New York -- mobs 暴民 of mostly Irish Americans attacked the wealthy and African-Americans.

Another way that the North is mobilizing their economy and the society for war is by a series of laws. You get a tariff law 关税法 passed, National Bank Act 国家银行法, the Homestead Act 宅地法, and of course the Emancipation Proclamation -- all of these are intended to raise money and to address the needs of Northern society to fight the war. Opposition 反对 doesn't just stop at the draft riots. Both Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln faced opposition on the home front 大后方. Jefferson Davis had a very difficult time -- lack of resources 资源匮乏 throughout the Confederacy but also the states' rights tradition 传统 in the South hindered 阻碍 the Confederacy's ability to fight the war. You have soldiers from different states refusing to leave their state to fight for the Confederacy. Lincoln has a number of things challenges on the home front. He does suspend 暂停 the writ of habeas corpus 人身保护令 in Maryland and other executive actions 行政措施 stopping newspapers that were critical of the Union. And this was something he did largely in order to keep the border states 边境州 in the Union.

And in the North, Lincoln once again is having to run for reelection 连任 in 1864. You should be aware of politics in the North -- you have Radical Republicans 激进共和党人, War Democrats 战争民主党人, Peace Democrats 和平民主党人, and Copperheads 铜头蛇派（亲南方的北方民主党人）all trying to put pressure on Lincoln to do things as they see they should be done. A big thing you need to keep in mind for 5.3 is the Emancipation Proclamation. As we said, it is announced following the Battle of Antietam. Lincoln decides to move forward with announcing the Emancipation. This is going to change the purpose of the war and the impact. There's a huge number of things you should keep in mind: one, it strengthens 加强 the moral cause 道德事业 of the North -- it's not just a war against secession, it's also against slavery; it helps keep Europe from giving full diplomatic support 外交支持 for the Confederacy; it gives the Union new African-American soldiers for the Union Army. In fact, people like Frederick Douglass saw enlistment 入伍 in the Union Army as an opportunity for African-Americans to prove their citizenship 公民身份. Remember the Dred Scott case had said no black people are citizens of the United States. For Douglass and others, this was a way for African-Americans to fight not only for their freedom but their citizenship.

There are some limits to the Emancipation Proclamation. Keep in mind the North had no authority 权威 in the Confederacy, and it does not apply to 适用于 the border states. Another kind of big idea in key concept 5.3 is this division 分歧 between Congressional Reconstruction 国会重建 and Presidential Reconstruction 总统重建 under Johnson. Both radical 激进的 and moderate Republicans 温和共和党人 take over Reconstruction policy from President Johnson. There's this anger when he begins to veto laws 否决法律 from Congress such as the extension of the Freedmen's Bureau 自由民局 and the Civil Rights Bill of 1866. And as a result, there is going to be a change in the balance of power 权力平衡 between Congress and the presidency. Congress is going to override 推翻 President Johnson's vetoes 否决权 and pass both of those laws. And as a result, they're also going to begin their own phase of reconstruction best symbolized by 以……为象征 the Reconstruction Act of 1867. This divides the South into five military districts 军事区 controlled by Union generals. This is Radical Reconstruction 激进重建 -- you could see the five different districts on the map above. And Congress will determine readmission requirements 重新加入联邦的条件, and the Johnson Plan and the Lincoln governments are invalidated 无效的. And the new criteria 标准 for admission is you need to create a new state constitution 州宪法, you need to include black suffrage 黑人选举权 in that constitution, and the states must ratify 批准 the 13th and 14th Amendments 修正案.

And President Johnson finds himself during this kind of shift 转变 in the balance of power facing the first instance 实例 of a president being impeached 弹劾. The Tenure of Office Act 任职期限法案 was passed, and it basically said the Senate must approve any presidential dismissal 解雇 of a cabinet official 内阁官员 or general. President Johnson famously removed the Secretary of War 战争部长 Edwin Stanton who was left over from the days of Lincoln, and the House of Representatives 众议院 immediately votes to impeach President Johnson. He is put on trial 受审 but he is not convicted 定罪 because Congress is one vote short of 差一票 the 2/3 required. Nonetheless 尽管如此, Radical Reconstruction is in full form, and you do have some successes under Radical Reconstruction. The Union is reunited 重新统一 it slowly under these new requirements of admission, and there are some short-term successes 短期成功. It opens up political opportunities 政治机会 to former slaves, and there's a temporary rearrangement 重新安排 of the relationship between white and black people in the South. Most famously for instance, Hiram Revels is elected senator 参议员 of Mississippi in 1870 to the seat that Jefferson Davis used to hold. And in that image you see other African-American congressmen 国会议员 voted into office during this Radical Reconstruction phase.

A key idea though you need to keep in mind is the 13th Amendment 第十三修正案 did abolish slavery 废除奴隶制, bringing about the war's most dramatic social and economic change, but the exploitative 剥削的 and soil-intensive 依赖土地的 sharecropping system 佃农制度 endured 持续 for several generations. Translation: Black Codes 黑人法典 were put in place which had the purpose was to guarantee 保证 a stable labor supply 劳动力供应 now that blacks were emancipated 获得解放的. And Southerners were really hoping in spite of 尽管 the 13th Amendment to restore 恢复 pre-emancipation system of race relations 种族关系制度. And some examples of the way they were able to do this is Black Codes made it illegal for African-Americans to rent 租赁 or borrow money to buy land. African-Americans were forced to sign labor contracts 劳动合同 -- if you did not have one you could be arrested for vagrancy 流浪罪. And there was a penalty 惩罚 for leaving before your contract expired 到期. Some of the other things that were a part of these Black Codes is African-Americans could not serve on a jury 担任陪审员 or vote. And as a result, many African-Americans were forced to become sharecroppers 佃农 which allowed them to use the land in exchange for 以……交换 giving a percent of the crop to the owner of the land. So they were bound to 束缚于 the land working it.

Once again, Reconstruction does have some short-term success but it is going to fall apart 崩溃. If you look at these maps of the elections, there was some Reconstruction governments -- the Republican Party was having some success. However, it falls apart for a couple of reasons: one, determined Southern resistance 坚决的南方抵抗. The Ku Klux Klan 三K党 is going to be established to secure white supremacy 白人至上 and to resist the Reconstruction government. You have the so-called Redeemer governments 救赎者政府 which sought to remove Republican Reconstruction governments that were made up of a coalition 联盟 freedmen 自由民, carpetbaggers 提包客（北方投机者）, and scalawags 无赖汉（南方叛徒）in the South. The redeemers were trying to get those individuals out of the South, and very often they use violence 暴力 as you can see in the image right there. There's also the North's waning resolve 逐渐减弱的决心 -- meaning Northerners were becoming less and less interested in using the power of the government to maintain Reconstruction. In fact, the Civil Rights Act of 1875 1875年民权法案 which guaranteed equal access to 平等进入 public places was rarely enforced 执行 and eventually overturned 推翻 by the Supreme Court 最高法院 in 1883. And in the 1870s, both Congress and President Grant would be unwilling to use the federal government's power to monitor 监督 Southern society.

Some events to keep in mind is the Panic of 1873 1873年恐慌 -- the nation increasingly became more worried about economic issues 经济问题. And the election of 1876 which was disputed 有争议的 leads to the Compromise of 1877 1877年妥协 which ultimately marks the end of Reconstruction. So those short-term successes do fade away 逐渐消失. We do have the Reconstruction amendments 重建修正案 you should be aware of: the 13th abolished slavery -- we saw there were limits to that; the 14th guaranteed citizenship and protection of rights of citizens with equal protection of the laws 法律的平等保护 and due process 正当程序; and then finally of course the 15th which guaranteed black male suffrage 黑人男性选举权. And important to keep in mind though -- although citizenship, equal protection of the laws, and voting rights were granted to African-Americans in the 14th and 15th Amendments, rights were restricted 限制. You're going to see segregation 种族隔离 -- Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法 take place in the 1870s and 1880s. Local political tactics 策略 were used such as literacy tests 识字测试, poll taxes 人头税, and grandfather clauses 祖父条款 to disenfranchise 剥夺选举权 African-American voters. Violence was used if that didn't work -- violence was used to scare and to suppress 压制 voters and rights amongst African-Americans in the South.

And Supreme Court decisions started to overturn Reconstruction laws. Plessy v. Ferguson 普莱西诉弗格森案 in 1896 -- segregation was ruled constitutional 合宪的 as long as it was separate but equal. And as already mentioned, the Civil Rights Cases of 1883 -- discrimination 歧视 was allowed if done by individuals or private businesses. The court declared and these cases rather ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional. It is important though to keep in mind the Reconstruction amendments established judicial principles 司法原则 that were stalled 停滞 for many decades but eventually would become the basis for 基础 court decisions upholding rights 维护权利. And the most famous example of this is the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause 平等保护条款 would serve as the basis for the Brown v. Board of Education 布朗诉教育委员会案 decision in 1954 -- a decision that would overturn racial segregation 种族隔离 particularly the Plessy v. Ferguson case. And it's really important you keep in mind how these Reconstruction amendments would be used in the 1950s and 1960s by the Civil Rights Movement 民权运动 to broaden rights 扩大权利 to new groups of people.

And one last thing -- there also was a division 分裂 amongst the women's rights movement. Leaders such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton opposed black male suffrage 选举权 and the 15th Amendment when it became clear that it was only going to be for males. So there's a split 分裂 within the women's rights movement about whether or not to support the 15th Amendment you should be aware about.

大家好，APUSH的同学们！今天我们来看一下第五时期的关键概念5.3，这实际上是关于内战和重建。一个需要记住的重要事情是联邦获胜的原因，因为在战争初期，南方邦联取得了一些早期的成功。他们赢得了第一次马纳萨斯之战（也称第一次布尔 Run 战役），这证明战争不会在90天内结束。“半岛战役”是联邦的失败，南方在战争开始时拥有一些优势。他们打的是防御战——他们只需要不输即可。他们在友好的民众中作战。他们有目标感——他们为他们所认为的南方生活方式而战，捍卫奴隶制，捍卫州权，反对他们认为滥用权力的联邦政府。他们还拥有许多经验丰富的军事官员——许多像罗伯特·E·李这样的大牌军事领导人在战争开始时加入了南方邦联。

但是北方慢慢地团结起来了，这主要是因为他们拥有更强大的工业资源。他们拥有南方不具备的制造能力。他们拥有更多的人力，这意味着更多的士兵可以参加战斗。随着战争的拖延，他们将利用海军实施军事战略，例如“蟒蛇计划”的封锁，并最终试图扼杀南方使其屈服。随着战争的进行，像威廉·特库姆塞·谢尔曼和尤利西斯·S·格兰特这样的军事领导人将在联邦中崛起。随着战争的拖延，你们将看到一些关键的胜利。

1862年的安提塔姆战役实际上是一场军事上的平局，但它阻止了外国势力站在南方邦联一边进行干预。由于南方没有赢得那场战斗，英国和法国重新考虑了承认或帮助南方邦联的想法，这也导致林肯宣布了《解放奴隶宣言》。葛底斯堡是另一个你们应该记住的战役——它阻止了南方邦联对宾夕法尼亚州联邦领土的进攻。与此同时，在维克斯堡战役中，尤利西斯·S·格兰特为联邦赢得了对密西西比河的控制权。1864年谢尔曼向大海的进军和亚特兰大的陷落——威廉·特库姆塞·谢尔曼率领部队在南方进行了一场蓄意的破坏性行军，这是联邦“全面战争”战略的一部分。你们摧毁南方的环境和基础设施，最终他们将投降。

一个需要记住的重要事情是，在安提塔姆战役之后，战争的目的不再仅仅是阻止分裂，还要阻止奴隶制，这在军事和意识形态上都给了联邦优势。双方——联邦和南方邦联——都将动员他们的经济和社会来支持战争。联邦和南方邦联都将采取征兵法——招募法——因为战斗需要士兵。而这些在北方和南方对穷人来说都是不公平的。在北方，有所谓的“300美元人”，你可以雇佣替补为你战斗。在南方，有所谓的“20名黑奴法”，如果你拥有超过20名奴隶，你就可以免服兵役。这种不公平导致了“富人的战争，穷人的战斗”的说法。你们看到了征兵暴动，最著名的是1863年7月在纽约发生的暴动——主要是爱尔兰裔美国人的暴徒袭击了富人和非裔美国人。

北方动员经济和社会支持战争的另一种方式是通过一系列法律。你们看到了通过的关税法、国家银行法、宅地法，当然还有《解放奴隶宣言》——所有这些都旨在筹集资金并满足北方社会进行战争的需求。反对意见不仅仅停留在征兵暴动上。杰斐逊·戴维斯和亚伯拉罕·林肯在国内都面临反对。杰斐逊·戴维斯处境非常艰难——整个南方邦联缺乏资源，而且南方各州的州权传统阻碍了南方邦联进行战争的能力。你们看到了来自不同州的士兵拒绝离开他们的州为南方邦联作战。林肯在国内面临许多挑战。他确实在马里兰州和其他地方暂停了人身保护令，并采取其他行政行动阻止批评联邦的报纸。他这样做主要是为了将边境各州留在联邦内。

在北方，林肯不得不在1864年再次竞选连任。你们应该了解北方的政治——你们有激进共和党人、战争民主党人、和平民主党人和“响尾蛇分子”，他们都试图向林肯施加压力，让他按照他们认为应该的方式行事。关于5.3，一个需要记住的重要事情是《解放奴隶宣言》。正如我们所说，它是在安提塔姆战役之后宣布的。林肯决定继续宣布解放。这将改变战争的目的和影响。你们应该记住许多重要的事情：第一，它加强了北方在道义上的理由——这不仅仅是一场反对分裂的战争，也是一场反对奴隶制的战争；它有助于阻止欧洲完全给予南方邦联外交支持；它为联邦军队提供了新的非裔美国士兵。事实上，像弗雷德里克·道格拉斯这样的人认为，加入联邦军队是非裔美国人证明自己公民身份的机会。记住，《德雷德·斯科特案》曾裁定没有黑人是美国公民。对于道格拉斯和其他人来说，这是非裔美国人为他们的自由和公民身份而战的一种方式。

《解放奴隶宣言》有一些局限性。记住，北方在南方邦联没有权力，它也不适用于边境各州。关键概念5.3中的另一个重要思想是约翰逊总统领导下的国会重建和总统重建之间的分歧。激进派和温和派共和党人都从约翰逊总统手中接管了重建政策。当他开始否决国会的法律，例如延长自由民事务局和1866年的《民权法案》时，人们感到愤怒。结果，国会和总统之间的权力平衡将发生变化。国会将推翻约翰逊总统的否决，并通过这两项法律。结果，他们也将开始他们自己的重建阶段，1867年的《重建法案》最好地象征了这一点。该法案将南方划分为五个由联邦将军控制的军事区。这就是激进重建——你们可以在上面的地图上看到五个不同的区域。国会将决定重新加入联邦的要求，约翰逊的计划和林肯的政府都被废止。新的加入联邦的标准是，你们需要制定新的州宪法，你们需要在宪法中包含黑人选举权，并且各州必须批准第十三和第十四修正案。

在权力平衡发生这种转变期间，约翰逊总统发现自己面临着总统被弹劾的第一个案例。《官员任期法》获得通过，该法案基本上规定，参议院必须批准总统解雇任何内阁官员或将军。约翰逊总统解雇了林肯时代留下的战争部长埃德温·斯坦顿，众议院立即投票弹劾约翰逊总统。他受到审判，但没有被定罪，因为国会离所需的2/3票数还差一票。尽管如此，激进重建正在全面展开，在激进重建时期你们确实取得了一些成功。在这些新的加入联邦的要求下，联邦正在缓慢地重新统一，并取得了一些短期成功。它为以前的奴隶打开了政治机会，南方白人和黑人之间的关系暂时得到了重新安排。最著名的例子是，海勒姆·雷维尔斯于1870年当选为密西西比州参议员，占据了杰斐逊·戴维斯曾经拥有的席位。在那张图片中，你们可以看到其他非裔美国国会议员在激进重建时期当选。

然而，一个需要记住的关键思想是，第十三修正案确实废除了奴隶制，带来了战争中最具戏剧性的社会和经济变革，但剥削性的和土地密集型的佃农制度持续了几代人。翻译：制定了“黑人法令”，其目的是在黑人获得解放后保障稳定的劳动力供应。尽管有了第十三修正案，南方人仍然真诚地希望恢复解放前的种族关系制度。他们能够做到这一点的一些例子是，“黑人法令”规定非裔美国人租赁或借钱购买土地是非法的。非裔美国人被迫签署劳动合同——如果没有合同，你们可能会因游荡罪被捕。提前解除合同会受到惩罚。这些“黑人法令”的其他内容包括，非裔美国人不能担任陪审员或投票。结果，许多非裔美国人被迫成为佃农，这使他们能够使用土地，以换取将一定比例的收成交给土地所有者。因此，他们被束缚在土地上劳作。

再一次，重建确实取得了一些短期成功，但它将会瓦解。如果你们看一下这些选举地图，当时存在一些重建政府——共和党取得了一些成功。然而，它瓦解的原因有以下几个：第一，南方坚决的抵抗。三K党将成立，以维护白人至上主义并抵抗重建政府。你们有所谓的“救赎者政府”，它们试图清除南方由获释的奴隶、北方佬和南方叛徒组成的联盟建立的共和党重建政府。救赎者试图将这些人赶出南方，他们经常使用暴力，正如你们在那张图片中看到的那样。还有北方日益减弱的决心——这意味着北方人越来越不愿意利用政府的力量来维持重建。事实上，1875年的《民权法案》保障了平等进入公共场所的权利，但很少得到执行，最终在1883年被最高法院推翻。在1870年代，国会和格兰特总统都不愿意利用联邦政府的权力来监督南方社会。

一些需要记住的事件是1873年恐慌——国家越来越担心经济问题。而1876年有争议的选举导致了1877年妥协案，该妥协案最终标志着重建的结束。因此，那些短期的成功确实消失了。我们确实有你们应该了解的重建修正案：第十三修正案废除了奴隶制——我们看到这方面存在限制；第十四修正案保障了公民身份和公民权利的保护，包括法律的平等保护和正当程序；最后当然是第十五修正案，它保障了黑人男性的选举权。然而，需要记住的是——尽管第十四和第十五修正案赋予了非裔美国人公民身份、法律的平等保护和投票权，但他们的权利受到了限制。你们将在1870年代和1880年代看到种族隔离——吉姆·克劳法。地方政治策略被用来剥夺非裔美国选民的权利，例如文化程度测试、人头税和祖父条款。如果这些方法不起作用，就会使用暴力——暴力被用来恐吓和压制南方非裔美国人的选民和权利。

最高法院的判决开始推翻重建时期的法律。1896年的普莱西诉弗格森案——只要是隔离但平等，种族隔离就被裁定为合宪。正如已经提到的，1883年的《民权案件》——允许个人或私营企业进行歧视。法院宣布，这些案件实际上裁定1875年的《民权法案》违宪。然而，重要的是要记住，重建修正案确立了司法原则，这些原则被搁置了几十年，但最终将成为法院支持权利的判决的基础。最著名的例子是，第十四修正案的平等保护条款将成为1954年布朗诉教育委员会案判决的基础——该判决推翻了种族隔离，特别是普莱西诉弗格森案。记住这些重建修正案在1950年代和1960年代如何被民权运动用来扩大新群体的权利非常重要。

最后一点——妇女权利运动内部也存在分歧。苏珊·B·安东尼和伊丽莎白·卡迪·斯坦顿等领导人反对黑人男性选举权和第十五修正案，当时很明显该修正案只适用于男性。因此，妇女权利运动内部关于是否支持第十五修正案存在分歧，你们应该了解这一点。

我强烈建议你们观看这两部视频，了解更多关于内战和重建的细节，但这为你们提供了关于关键概念5.3需要了解的关键内容的广泛概述。希望你们学到了一些东西。如果你们还没有订阅频道，请订阅，告诉一些朋友，点击视频的“喜欢”，如果有任何问题，请发表评论——我会尽快回复你们。再见！

What up APUSH people? Today we're going to take a look at period 5 key concept 5.3, and this is really the Civil War and reconstruction. An important thing to keep in mind is the reasons the Union wins the war, because in the beginning the Confederacy has some early success. They win the Battle of Bull Run which proves the war is not going to be over in 90 days. The Peninsula Campaign is a defeat for the Union, and there's some advantages the South has going into this war. They're fighting a defensive war -- all they have to do is not lose.

And Sherman's March to the Sea and the fall of Atlanta in 1864 -- William Tecumseh Sherman leads a march of deliberate destruction throughout the South, and this is part of the Union strategy of total war. You destroy the Southern environment and its infrastructure, and eventually they will surrender.

It opens up political opportunities to former slaves, and there's a temporary rearrangement of the relationship between white and black people in the South. Most famously for instance, Hiram Revels is elected senator of Mississippi in 1870 to the seat that Jefferson Davis used to hold. And in that image you see other African-American congressmen voted into office during this Radical Reconstruction phase.

A key idea though you need to keep in mind is the 13th Amendment did abolish slavery, bringing about the war's most dramatic social and economic change, but the exploitative and soil-intensive sharecropping system endured for several generations. Translation: Black Codes were put in place which had the purpose was to guarantee a stable labor supply now that blacks were emancipated. And Southerners were really hoping in spite of the 13th Amendment to restore pre-emancipation system of race relations. And some examples of the way they were able to do this is Black Codes made it illegal for African-Americans to rent or borrow money to buy land. African-Americans were forced to sign labor contracts -- if you did not have one you could be arrested for vagrancy. And there was a penalty for leaving before your contract expired. Some of the other things that were a part of these Black Codes is African-Americans could not serve on a jury or vote. And as a result, many African-Americans were forced to become sharecroppers which allowed them to use the land in exchange for giving a percent of the crop to the owner of the land. So they were bound to the land working it.

Once again, Reconstruction does have some short-term success but it is going to fall apart. If you look at these maps of the elections, there was some Reconstruction governments -- the Republican Party was having some success. However, it falls apart for a couple of reasons: one, determined Southern resistance. The Ku Klux Klan is going to be established to secure white supremacy and to resist the Reconstruction government. You have the so-called Redeemer governments which sought to remove Republican Reconstruction governments that were made up of a coalition freedmen, carpetbaggers, and scalawags in the South. The redeemers were trying to get those individuals out of the South, and very often they use violence as you can see in the image right there. There's also the North's waning resolve -- meaning Northerners were becoming less and less interested in using the power of the government to maintain Reconstruction. In fact, the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which guaranteed equal access to public places was rarely enforced and eventually overturned by the Supreme Court in 1883. And in the 1870s, both Congress and President Grant would be unwilling to use the federal government's power to monitor Southern society.

Some events to keep in mind is the Panic of 1873 -- the nation increasingly became more worried about economic issues. And the election of 1876 which was disputed leads to the Compromise of 1877 which ultimately marks the end of Reconstruction. So those short-term successes do fade away. We do have the Reconstruction amendments you should be aware of: the 13th abolished slavery -- we saw there were limits to that; the 14th guaranteed citizenship and protection of rights of citizens with equal protection of the laws and due process; and then finally of course the 15th which guaranteed black male suffrage. And important to keep in mind though -- although citizenship, equal protection of the laws, and voting rights were granted to African-Americans in the 14th and 15th Amendments, rights were restricted. You're going to see segregation -- Jim Crow laws take place in the 1870s and 1880s. Local political tactics were used such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses to disenfranchise African-American voters. Violence was used if that didn't work -- violence was used to scare and to suppress voters and rights amongst African-Americans in the South.

And Supreme Court decisions started to overturn Reconstruction laws. Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 -- segregation was ruled constitutional as long as it was separate but equal. And as already mentioned, the Civil Rights Cases of 1883 -- discrimination was allowed if done by individuals or private businesses. The court declared and these cases rather ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional. It is important though to keep in mind the Reconstruction amendments established judicial principles that were stalled for many decades but eventually would become the basis for court decisions upholding rights. And the most famous example of this is the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause would serve as the basis for the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 -- a decision that would overturn racial segregation particularly the Plessy v. Ferguson case. And it's really important you keep in mind how these Reconstruction amendments would be used in the 1950s and 1960s by the Civil Rights Movement to broaden rights to new groups of people.

And one last thing -- there also was a division amongst the women's rights movement. Leaders such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton opposed black male suffrage and the 15th Amendment when it became clear that it was only going to be for males. So there's a split within the women's rights movement about whether or not to support the 15th Amendment you should be aware about.
