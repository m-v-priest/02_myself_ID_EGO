== 释义

Welcome back to another Joe's Productions video. Today we're going to be taking a look at World War One. We're going to try to help you score five on that APUSH exam in May. And if you're reading any APUSH textbook and you're studying World War One, this video is going to help you out.

One important point to keep in mind is remember US entry into World War One 第一次世界大战 was a slow process 缓慢的过程. In the beginning of the war we are neutral 中立的, but continued violations of US neutrality 持续侵犯美国中立地位 is going to put Woodrow Wilson 伍德罗·威尔逊 in a difficult position 置于困境. Remember we had learned about events such as the sinking of the British ship the Lusitania 卢西塔尼亚号, the French ship the Sussex 苏塞克斯号. And Germany does apologize for the sinking of some of those ships, and there is a temporary pause 暂时停止 in German sinking of ships after the Sussex -- they issue the Sussex Pledge 苏塞克斯承诺 where they promise not to sink any more ships without warning 承诺不事先警告不再击沉任何船只.

However Germany proceeds to commit other acts 继续实施其他行为 which angers many people in America. There is the Zimmerman Note 齐默尔曼电报 you should know about where the British intercept 截获 a German proposal to Mexico calling for a joint alliance 联合联盟. And basically in the Zimmerman Note they're asking -- Germany's asking Mexico to attack the United States to form an alliance, and they would be allowed to recover the lost territory 收复失地 of that territory in the light-green 浅绿色区域. This obviously causes a lot of anger in the United States.

And in spring of 1917 Germany returns to unrestricted submarine warfare 无限制潜艇战. They just start sinking ships, and they knew that this would cause the US to enter into World War One, but they were hoping they would win the war before US troops could get to Europe. Well enough was enough 忍无可忍, and in April of 1917 Congress 国会 declares war against Germany 对德宣战. The United States enters World War One. In fact when Wilson asked Congress to declare war he says one of the things that he was hoping for was to make the world safe for democracy 让世界变得安全，以利于民主. Wilson really believed that this would be the war to end all wars 结束所有战争的战争.

But make sure you know that the key factors for our involvement in World War One: 1) German attacks on American shipping 德国袭击美国船只, 2) the Zimmerman Telegram 齐默尔曼电报 proposing an alliance with Mexico 提议与墨西哥结盟, but don't forget that Wilson has a desire to be involved in the post-war settlement 战后和解.

Now when the war starts the United States is completely unprepared for war 毫无战争准备. We have a lack of fighting men 缺乏战斗人员. Factories 工厂 are not prepared for war production 战争生产, and the country has to mobilize for war 动员起来投入战争. In fact one of the first things they do is they pass the Selective Service Act 选征兵役法 which basically starts conscription 征兵 or a draft 征兵制度. It organizes a draft for soldiers to fight in the war 组织征兵. All men between a certain age have to register 登记, and the big fighting force under General Pershing 潘兴将军 will be known as the American Expeditionary Force 美国远征军, and they will do a lot of the heavy fighting 激烈战斗 over in Europe near the end of the war.

This is a total war effort 全面战争动员 which basically means all aspects of the country mobilized for the war effort 国家各个方面都动员起来支持战争 -- so not just on the battlefield 战场 but also on the homefront 后方. In fact one of the big things that they needed to do was pay for the war 为战争筹集资金, and the war will be financed by war bonds 战争债券 sometimes referred to as Liberty Loans 自由贷款 and income taxes 所得税 which were allowed to be taken by the government as a result of the 16th Amendment 第十六条修正案.

An important point you definitely need to keep in mind is that all these different agencies 机构 where the federal government and business working together 联邦政府与企业合作 will be created during World War One. This is a huge mobilization 大规模动员. So for example you have the National War Labor Board 全国战时劳工委员会 which was intended to help mediate labor disputes 调解劳资纠纷 and prevent strikes 防止罢工 -- so the federal government working with organized labor 有组织的劳工 and business to try to keep the war production going 维持战争生产. Unions 工会 had different opinions about World War One. The American Federation of Labor 美国劳工联合会 supported the war effort 支持战争而 the IWW 世界产业工人组织 oftentimes opposed the war 经常反对战争 and called for strikes during war production 战争生产期间号召罢工.

Another government agency working with business was the War Industries Board 战时工业委员会. They would set production priorities 生产优先事项 for the war -- so allocating scarce resources 分配稀缺资源, centralizing control over raw materials and prices 集中控制原材料和价格 so that the war could be won with efficient production 高效生产赢得战争. The one you should know about is the US Food Administration 美国食品管理局 headed by a future President Herbert Hoover 未来总统赫伯特·胡佛 which encouraged Americans to conserve food 节约食物 for the war effort so that there would be enough meat, sugar and other supplies for soldiers over on the battlefield 战场上的士兵有足够的肉类、糖和其他物资.

And an interesting thing happens as a result of this war effort is World War One boosts support for temperance 禁酒 -- or rather prohibition 禁酒令. In fact support for the 18th Amendment 第十八条修正案 increases, and the 18th Amendment prohibited the sale, consumption, manufacture or transport of alcohol 禁止酒精的销售、消费、制造或运输. And there's a couple of different reasons why the war will do this: 1) you want to conserve resources 节约资源 which we need food resources for the war effort 战争需要食物资源, but also 2) there's a lot of anti-German sentiment 反德情绪 in the United States, and if you don't know much about beer -- beer is very much a German tradition 德国传统.

Another aspect of the war that's important to know about is the effort to silence dissent 压制异议 or to stop people from opposing the war 阻止人们反对战争. And there were organizations run by the federal government such as the Committee of Public Information 公共信息委员会. This one was headed by George Creel 乔治·克里尔 -- very important guy -- who promoted the US war effort with propaganda 宣传. And their job was to create films and posters and speeches to get people to buy Liberty Loans and war bonds 购买自由贷款和战争债券 and to get people to support World War One 支持第一次世界大战.

For those people that tried to oppose it, different laws were put in place 制定了不同的法律. The Espionage Act 间谍法 is one in 1917 -- it prohibited interference with the draft 征兵 or the war effort 战争行动. You could actually be put in jail 入狱. The Sedition Act 煽动叛乱法 was passed in 1918. This is much more broad 宽泛的 than the Espionage Act -- it banned anybody from criticizing the government 禁止任何人批评政府. So you cannot speak ill of 说坏话 Congress, the president, the military, the American flag 美国国旗. And nearly around 2,000 people are arrested -- many put in jail such as Eugene Debs 尤金·德布斯 for violating the Espionage and Sedition Acts 违反间谍法和煽动叛乱法.

In fact one of the things that happens as a result of the war is a huge increase in anti-German sentiment 反德情绪大幅上升. In fact nativists 本土主义者 -- anti-immigrant individuals 反移民者 -- attack all things German 攻击一切与德国有关的事物. They refer to them as the Huns 匈奴人 in popular posters like the one you see right there.

Now I know what you're wondering -- what about the First Amendment 第一修正案? And the Supreme Court of the United States 美国最高法院 did hear a case -- one of the first cases about the First Amendment -- Schenck versus the United States 申克诉美国案. And what happens is there's a guy named Charles Schenck 查尔斯·申克 who was arrested -- he's a socialist 社会主义者. He's arrested under the Espionage Act 间谍法 for mailing leaflets 传单 -- pamphlets 小册子 -- to men eligible for the draft 符合征兵条件的人, and he basically is telling them don't go and fight in this war 不要参加这场战争. He's arrested under the Espionage Act, and he sues the government on the grounds that they are violating his First Amendment rights 以政府侵犯其第一修正案权利为由起诉政府.

And what happens in an unanimous decision 一致裁决 -- the Supreme Court supports the argument that freedom of speech 言论自由 could be restricted 受到限制. And they basically say Congress has the power to restrain speech 限制言论 -- to ban speech -- if it posed a clear and present danger 构成明显而即刻的危险. And they use this example that you're not allowed to go into a crowded theater 拥挤的剧院 and yell fire 大喊着火了 and claim First Amendment rights 声称享有第一修正案权利. And they say freedom of speech can be restricted. And it's really important that you understand there was a very restrictive atmosphere 限制氛围 for civil liberties 公民自由 in America during World War One.

And this is not the first time we've seen this delicate balance 微妙平衡 between security 安全 -- being safe -- and liberty 自由 -- our freedoms -- in a time of crisis 危机时刻. So World War One we see things like the Espionage Act, the Sedition Act 间谍法、煽动叛乱法. And recall 回想 during the French Revolution 法国大革命 Federalists 联邦党人 passed the Alien and Sedition Acts 客籍法和煽动叛乱法 basically taking away rights from people at a time of alleged crisis 所谓的危机时刻剥夺人们的权利. And once again during the Civil War 美国内战 you see Lincoln 林肯 using his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus 暂停人身保护令 to try to keep the border states 边境州 in the Union 留在联邦内. And we're going to see this again and again. World War One is not the first time.




Now what is going to have a huge impact on the homefront 国内战线? A lot of different groups are going to be impacted by the war. In fact African Americans -- we're already before the war even started kind of roughly in 1910 -- large migration 迁移；迁徙 of African Americans to northern cities like Chicago. And this is called the Great Migration 大迁徙, and you can see that in this painting right there.

There's a lot of reasons why African Americans are moving north: 1) crappy racial relations 种族关系, Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法 in the south, and so you want to get out. But what changes during World War One is the opening of new economic opportunities -- jobs in northern factories as white men were drafted 被征召入伍 and sent off to war. During this time you also see an increase in Mexican immigration into the US to work in agriculture primarily in the southwest to take over jobs that were needed during the war effort.

Nearly 400,000 African Americans served in the US Armed Forces 武装部队. They do unfortunately serve in segregated units 隔离部队. But civil rights leaders 民权领袖 like W.E.B. Du Bois felt that if African Americans fought for the United States during the war that this would lead to greater equality when they returned. This unfortunately was not a reality as race riots 种族骚乱 break out in 1919. There's a lot of racial tension 种族紧张局势 as a result of these demographic changes 人口变化 such as the Great Migration, and you have race riots break out in cities such as Chicago.

Women will play a key role in the war as well and will experience their own set of social changes. Women are going to take over jobs in factories as men leave. Jobs that were normally not open to women suddenly become available because the country needs them. In fact because of the sacrifices 牺牲 of women on the homefront during World War One you will see finally the two-thirds needed majority in Congress finally supporting the 19th Amendment 第十九修正案 which grants women's suffrage 妇女选举权 -- the right to vote. And great image right there of women protesting in front of the White House demanding for the basic rights such as voting.

As the war is winding down 逐渐结束, Wilson has a vision for the post-war world which is known as the Fourteen Points 十四点原则. This is his proposal, and in it he really wants to prevent another world war from happening. He wants to address the causes of the first world war and try to make sure that those things never take place. There are 14 points in this document, but we're only going to break down some of the important ones.

So how's Wilson thinking he's going to accomplish this? Well he's going to address some of those causes of the first world war. He wants to guarantee freedom of the seas 公海自由, eliminate economic trade barriers 经济贸易壁垒, military reductions 军事裁减 -- no huge arms race 军备竞赛 is taking place. He wants to get rid of colonies -- in fact allow self-determination 自决 for nations to have self-government -- no more colonization. He wants no more secret treaties 秘密条约. And the big thing he really wants is he calls for the formation of a League of Nations 国际联盟 to help prevent another war.

The problem for Wilson is he does not get to dictate 命令；支配 the terms of the post-war settlement. He has to work with the Big Four 四大国 -- includes Wilson over there on the right -- you have England, Italy and France. And these allies 盟友 are not really idealistic 理想主义的 as Wilson was. Here he is in the political cartoon kind of asking for everlasting peace 持久和平, but for nations such as France and England they want to punish Germany, gain territory 获得领土 and use the war as an opportunity to benefit their country.

So while Wilson wants peace without victory 没有胜利的和平, the other allies are not really interested in his idealistic ideas. So the Treaty of Versailles 凡尔赛条约 very much reflects this rejection of much of Wilson's Fourteen Points. They're rejected by the other Allied powers 协约国, and you can see in the political cartoon kind of some of the things that they want. Wilson does get the League of Nations included. He really kind of is hopeful that this will be a worldwide organization that will prevent future wars. But he has to get it approved by the Republican-controlled Congress.

And many Republicans in Congress hated the idea of the US joining the League of Nations. And one of the big opponents 反对者 of the treaty was Henry Cabot Lodge, and he belonged to a group called the Reservationists 保留派. And he believed that he would accept the League of Nations -- he would accept the treaty -- if certain changes were made. And Wilson was reluctant 不情愿的 to compromise 妥协. There was another group of Republicans known as the Irreconcilables 不可调和派, and they were against the treaty no matter what Wilson was willing to do.

There's substantial debate 重大辩论 over the League of Nations between Wilson and the Senate, and it comes down to a couple of things: 1) there's a tradition of isolationist policies 孤立主义政策 -- we try to avoid European affairs. If you recall George Washington had warned about the dangers of permanent foreign alliances 永久性外国联盟. Another problem with the League of Nations amongst Republicans was the opposition over Article 10 第十条款. And under Article 10 it said that member nations of the League of Nations would have to help other nations out in the event of external aggression 外部侵略. And there was a fear -- as you could see in the political cartoon -- that the League would force the US to deal with foreign issues around Europe -- that we get dragged into Europe's mess. And there also was the fear that Europe would meddle 干涉 in the Western Hemisphere which under the Monroe Doctrine 门罗主义 we did not want them to do.

Another kind of factor amongst Republicans and others was the desire amongst many to be isolationist following World War One. We fought this brutal horrible war, and there was a feeling we just kind of wanted to focus on us. And ultimately Congress rejects the treaty. The League of Nations is formed and without the United States -- a super important point to keep in mind.

There's an old World War One tank. Many mark the U.S. rejection of the League of Nations as a withdrawal of the U.S. from international affairs in the 1920s. And as we're going to see in the next video, this is a little bit more complicated than that.

欢迎回到另一个乔氏制作的视频。今天我们要探讨第一次世界大战。我们将尽力帮助你在五月份的APUSH考试中拿到五分。如果你正在阅读任何APUSH教材并学习第一次世界大战，这个视频将对你有所帮助。

需要记住的一个重要点是，美国卷入第一次世界大战是一个缓慢的过程。战争初期我们保持中立，但持续侵犯美国中立的行为将使伍德罗·威尔逊处于一个困难的境地。记住我们已经了解了诸如英国的卢西塔尼亚号沉没和法国的苏塞克斯号沉没等事件。德国确实为击沉其中一些船只道歉，并且在苏塞克斯号事件后德国暂时停止了击沉船只——他们发布了苏塞克斯保证，承诺不再在没有警告的情况下击沉任何船只。

然而，德国继续采取其他激怒许多美国人的行动。你们应该了解齐默曼电报，英国截获了一份德国向墨西哥发出的呼吁建立联合联盟的提议。基本上，在齐默曼电报中，德国要求墨西哥攻击美国以建立联盟，并且墨西哥将被允许收回浅绿色区域失去的领土。这显然在美国引起了极大的愤怒。

1917年春天，德国恢复了无限制潜艇战。他们开始随意击沉船只，他们知道这将导致美国卷入第一次世界大战，但他们希望在美国军队到达欧洲之前赢得战争。最终，忍无可忍，1917年4月，国会对德国宣战。美国卷入了第一次世界大战。事实上，当威尔逊要求国会宣战时，他说他希望的目标之一是使世界对民主来说是安全的。威尔逊真的相信这将是结束所有战争的战争。

但请务必了解我们卷入第一次世界大战的关键因素：1）德国袭击美国船只；2）齐默曼电报提议与墨西哥结盟；但不要忘记威尔逊渴望参与战后安排。

战争开始时，美国完全没有做好战争准备。我们缺乏作战人员。工厂没有为战争生产做好准备，国家必须动员起来进行战争。事实上，他们首先做的事情之一就是通过了《兵役法》，该法案基本上开始了征兵。它组织征兵以士兵参加战争。所有在一定年龄之间的男子都必须登记，在潘兴将军领导下的主要作战部队将被称为美国远征军，他们将在战争后期在欧洲进行大量的艰苦战斗。

这是一场总体战，基本上意味着国家的所有方面都为战争努力动员起来——不仅在战场上，而且在后方也是如此。事实上，他们需要做的重要事情之一是支付战争费用，战争将通过战争债券（有时称为自由贷款）和所得税来融资，由于第十六修正案的通过，政府可以征收所得税。

你们绝对需要记住的一个重要点是，在第一次世界大战期间，将建立所有这些不同的机构，联邦政府和企业将在其中共同合作。这是一次巨大的动员。例如，你们有国家战争劳工委员会，其目的是帮助调解劳资纠纷并防止罢工——因此联邦政府与有组织的劳工和企业合作，试图维持战争生产的进行。工会对第一次世界大战持有不同的看法。美国劳工联合会支持战争努力，而世界产业工人组织（IWW）经常反对战争并在战争生产期间呼吁罢工。

另一个与企业合作的政府机构是战争工业委员会。他们将为战争设定生产优先事项——因此分配稀缺资源，集中控制原材料和价格，以便通过高效生产赢得战争。你们应该了解的是由未来的总统赫伯特·胡佛领导的美国食品管理局，该局鼓励美国人为战争努力节约粮食，以便战场上的士兵有足够的肉类、糖和其他物资。

战争努力的一个有趣结果是，第一次世界大战促进了对节制——或者更确切地说，是禁酒的支持。事实上，对第十八修正案的支持增加了，该修正案禁止酒精的销售、消费、制造或运输。战争导致这种情况发生有几个不同的原因：1）你们想要节约资源，我们需要粮食资源用于战争努力；但2）美国存在大量的反德情绪，如果你不太了解啤酒——啤酒在很大程度上是德国的传统。

战争的另一个重要方面是努力压制异议或阻止人们反对战争。联邦政府运营了一些组织，例如公共信息委员会。该委员会由乔治·克里尔领导——非常重要的人物——他通过宣传来推动美国的战争努力。他们的工作是制作电影、海报和演讲，以促使人们购买自由贷款和战争债券，并支持第一次世界大战。

对于那些试图反对战争的人，制定了不同的法律。《间谍法》是1917年的一项法律——它禁止干涉征兵或战争努力。你实际上可能会被监禁。《煽动叛乱法》于1918年通过。这比《间谍法》更为广泛——它禁止任何人批评政府。因此，你不能说国会、总统、军队或美国国旗的坏话。近2000人被捕——许多人被监禁，例如尤金·德布斯因违反《间谍法》和《煽动叛乱法》而被捕。

事实上，战争导致反德情绪大幅上升。事实上，本土主义者——反移民人士——攻击所有与德国有关的事物。他们在流行的海报中称他们为匈奴人，就像你们在那张海报上看到的那样。

我知道你们在想什么——第一修正案呢？美国最高法院确实审理了一个案件——关于第一修正案的早期案件之一——申克诉美国案。事情是这样的，一个名叫查尔斯·申克的人被捕了——他是一个社会主义者。他因邮寄传单——小册子——给符合征兵条件的男子而被根据《间谍法》逮捕，他基本上是告诉他们不要去参加这场战争。他因违反《间谍法》而被捕，并以政府侵犯了他的第一修正案权利为由起诉政府。

在一个一致的判决中——最高法院支持言论自由可以受到限制的论点。他们基本上说，如果言论构成明显的现实危险，国会有权限制言论——禁止言论。他们使用了这个例子，即你不允许在拥挤的剧院里大喊“着火了”，然后声称享有第一修正案的权利。他们说言论自由可以受到限制。理解在第一次世界大战期间，美国公民自由的氛围非常压抑非常重要。

这并非我们第一次在危机时期看到安全——安全保障——与自由——我们的自由——之间存在这种微妙的平衡。因此，在第一次世界大战中，我们看到了《间谍法》和《煽动叛乱法》等法律。回想一下，在法国大革命期间，联邦党人通过了《外国人与煽动叛乱法》，基本上在所谓的危机时期剥夺了人民的权利。再一次，在内战期间，你们看到林肯暂停人身保护令，试图将边境州留在联邦。我们将一次又一次地看到这种情况。第一次世界大战并非第一次。

现在，什么将对后方产生巨大的影响？许多不同的群体将受到战争的影响。事实上，非裔美国人——甚至在战争开始之前，大约在1910年——大量非裔美国人迁移到芝加哥等北部城市。这被称为大迁移，你们可以在那幅画中看到。

非裔美国人向北方迁移有很多原因：1）糟糕的种族关系，南方的吉姆·克劳法，所以你们想要离开。但第一次世界大战期间发生的变化是新的经济机会的出现——由于白人男子被征召入伍，北部工厂的就业机会增加。在此期间，你们还看到墨西哥移民涌入美国，主要是在西南部从事农业工作，以填补战争期间所需的职位。

近40万非裔美国人在美国武装部队服役。不幸的是，他们是在隔离部队中服役。但像W.E.B.杜波依斯这样的民权领袖认为，如果非裔美国人在战争期间为美国而战，那么当他们回来时，这将导致更大的平等。不幸的是，这并非现实，1919年爆发了种族骚乱。由于大迁移等人口变化，种族紧张局势加剧，芝加哥等城市爆发了种族骚乱。

妇女也将在战争中发挥关键作用，并将经历一系列社会变革。随着男子离开，妇女将接管工厂的工作。通常不对妇女开放的工作突然变得可用，因为国家需要她们。事实上，由于妇女在第一次世界大战期间在后方的牺牲，你们最终将看到国会中三分之二的多数票最终支持第十九修正案，该修正案赋予妇女选举权。这是一张很棒的图片，妇女们在白宫前抗议，要求获得投票等基本权利。

随着战争逐渐结束，威尔逊对战后世界有一个愿景，被称为“十四点原则”。这是他的提议，他真正希望阻止另一场世界大战的发生。他希望解决第一次世界大战的起因，并努力确保这些事情不再发生。这份文件有14点，但我们只分析其中一些重要的。

那么威尔逊认为他将如何实现这一目标呢？他将解决第一次世界大战的一些起因。他希望保障海洋自由，消除经济贸易壁垒，削减军事力量——不再发生大规模的军备竞赛。他希望摆脱殖民地——事实上允许各国自决，实现自治——不再有殖民主义。他希望不再有秘密条约。他真正希望的是，他呼吁成立一个国际联盟以帮助防止另一场战争。

威尔逊的问题在于，他无法决定战后安排的条款。他必须与四大强国合作——包括右边的威尔逊——你们有英国、意大利和法国。这些盟友并不像威尔逊那样理想主义。在这幅政治漫画中，他似乎在要求永久和平，但对于法国和英国等国家来说，他们想要惩罚德国，获得领土，并利用战争作为机会来使他们的国家受益。

因此，尽管威尔逊希望实现没有胜利的和平，但其他盟友对他的理想主义想法并不感兴趣。因此，《凡尔赛条约》在很大程度上反映了对威尔逊十四点原则大部分内容的拒绝。它们被其他协约国拒绝了，你们可以在政治漫画中看到他们想要的一些东西。威尔逊确实将国际联盟纳入其中。他真的希望这将是一个能够防止未来战争的世界性组织。但他必须得到共和党控制的国会的批准。

国会中的许多共和党人憎恨美国加入国际联盟的想法。该条约的主要反对者之一是亨利·卡博特·洛奇，他属于一个被称为“保留派”的团体。他认为，如果做出某些修改，他将接受国际联盟——他将接受该条约。而威尔逊不愿妥协。另一群共和党人被称为“不可调和派”，无论威尔逊愿意做什么，他们都反对该条约。

威尔逊和参议院之间就国际联盟展开了激烈的辩论，这归结为几点：1）存在孤立主义政策的传统——我们试图避免欧洲事务。如果你们还记得，乔治·华盛顿曾警告过永久性对外联盟的危险。共和党人反对国际联盟的另一个问题是反对第十条。根据第十条，国际联盟的成员国在遭受外部侵略时必须互相帮助。人们担心——正如你们在政治漫画中看到的那样——国际联盟将迫使美国处理欧洲周围的外国问题——我们将被拖入欧洲的烂摊子。人们还担心欧洲会干涉西半球，而根据门罗主义，我们不希望他们这样做。

共和党人和其他人中存在的另一种因素是，第一次世界大战后许多人渴望孤立主义。我们打了一场残酷可怕的战争，人们感觉我们只想专注于我们自己。最终，国会拒绝了该条约。国际联盟成立了，但没有美国——这是一个非常重要的需要记住的点。

这是一辆老式的第一次世界大战坦克。许多人将美国拒绝国际联盟视为美国在1920年代退出国际事务的标志。正如我们将在下一个视频中看到的那样，这比那要复杂一些。

但在下次见面之前，感谢观看另一个乔氏制作的视频。

Welcome back to another Joe's Productions video. Today we're going to be taking a look at World War One. We're going to try to help you score five on that APUSH exam in May. And if you're reading any APUSH textbook and you're studying World War One, this video is going to help you out.

One important point to keep in mind is remember US entry into World War One was a slow process. In the beginning of the war we are neutral, but continued violations of US neutrality is going to put Woodrow Wilson in a difficult position. Remember we had learned about events such as the sinking of the British ship the Lusitania, the French ship the Sussex. And Germany does apologize for the sinking of some of those ships, and there is a temporary pause in German sinking of ships after the Sussex -- they issue the Sussex Pledge where they promise not to sink any more ships without warning.

However Germany proceeds to commit other acts which angers many people in America. There is the Zimmerman Note you should know about where the British intercept a German proposal to Mexico calling for a joint alliance. And basically in the Zimmerman Note they're asking -- Germany's asking Mexico to attack the United States to form an alliance, and they would be allowed to recover the lost territory of that territory in the light-green. This obviously causes a lot of anger in the United States.

And in spring of 1917 Germany returns to unrestricted submarine warfare. They just start sinking ships, and they knew that this would cause the US to enter into World War One, but they were hoping they would win the war before US troops could get to Europe. Well enough was enough, and in April of 1917 Congress declares war against Germany. The United States enters World War One. In fact when Wilson asked Congress to declare war he says one of the things that he was hoping for was to make the world safe for democracy. Wilson really believed that this would be the war to end all wars.

But make sure you know that the key factors for our involvement in World War One: 1) German attacks on American shipping, 2) the Zimmerman Telegram proposing an alliance with Mexico, but don't forget that Wilson has a desire to be involved in the post-war settlement.

Now when the war starts the United States is completely unprepared for war. We have a lack of fighting men. Factories are not prepared for war production, and the country has to mobilize for war. In fact one of the first things they do is they pass the Selective Service Act which basically starts conscription or a draft. It organizes a draft for soldiers to fight in the war. All men between a certain age have to register, and the big fighting force under General Pershing will be known as the American Expeditionary Force, and they will do a lot of the heavy fighting over in Europe near the end of the war.

This is a total war effort which basically means all aspects of the country mobilized for the war effort -- so not just on the battlefield but also on the homefront. In fact one of the big things that they needed to do was pay for the war, and the war will be financed by war bonds sometimes referred to as Liberty Loans and income taxes which were allowed to be taken by the government as a result of the 16th Amendment.

An important point you definitely need to keep in mind is that all these different agencies where the federal government and business working together will be created during World War One. This is a huge mobilization. So for example you have the National War Labor Board which was intended to help mediate labor disputes and prevent strikes -- so the federal government working with organized labor and business to try to keep the war production going. Unions had different opinions about World War One. The American Federation of Labor supported the war effort whereas the IWW oftentimes opposed the war and called for strikes during war production.

Another government agency working with business was the War Industries Board. They would set production priorities for the war -- so allocating scarce resources, centralizing control over raw materials and prices so that the war could be won with efficient production. The one you should know about is the US Food Administration headed by a future President Herbert Hoover which encouraged Americans to conserve food for the war effort so that there would be enough meat, sugar and other supplies for soldiers over on the battlefield.

And an interesting thing happens as a result of this war effort is World War One boosts support for temperance -- or rather prohibition. In fact support for the 18th Amendment increases, and the 18th Amendment prohibited the sale, consumption, manufacture or transport of alcohol. And there's a couple of different reasons why the war will do this: 1) you want to conserve resources which we need food resources for the war effort, but also 2) there's a lot of anti-German sentiment in the United States, and if you don't know much about beer -- beer is very much a German tradition.

Another aspect of the war that's important to know about is the effort to silence dissent or to stop people from opposing the war. And there were organizations run by the federal government such as the Committee of Public Information. This one was headed by George Creel -- very important guy -- who promoted the US war effort with propaganda. And their job was to create films and posters and speeches to get people to buy Liberty Loans and war bonds and to get people to support World War One.

For those people that tried to oppose it, different laws were put in place. The Espionage Act is one in 1917 -- it prohibited interference with the draft or the war effort. You could actually be put in jail. The Sedition Act was passed in 1918. This is much more broad than the Espionage Act -- it banned anybody from criticizing the government. So you cannot speak ill of Congress, the president, the military, the American flag. And nearly around 2,000 people are arrested -- many put in jail such as Eugene Debs for violating the Espionage and Sedition Acts.

In fact one of the things that happens as a result of the war is a huge increase in anti-German sentiment. In fact nativists -- anti-immigrant individuals -- attack all things German. They refer to them as the Huns in popular posters like the one you see right there.

Now I know what you're wondering -- what about the First Amendment? And the Supreme Court of the United States did hear a case -- one of the first cases about the First Amendment -- Schenck versus the United States. And what happens is there's a guy named Charles Schenck who was arrested -- he's a socialist. He's arrested under the Espionage Act for mailing leaflets -- pamphlets -- to men eligible for the draft, and he basically is telling them don't go and fight in this war. He's arrested under the Espionage Act, and he sues the government on the grounds that they are violating his First Amendment rights.

And what happens in an unanimous decision -- the Supreme Court supports the argument that freedom of speech could be restricted. And they basically say Congress has the power to restrain speech -- to ban speech -- if it posed a clear and present danger. And they use this example that you're not allowed to go into a crowded theater and yell fire and claim First Amendment rights. And they say freedom of speech can be restricted. And it's really important that you understand there was a very restrictive atmosphere for civil liberties in America during World War One.

And this is not the first time we've seen this delicate balance between security -- being safe -- and liberty -- our freedoms -- in a time of crisis. So World War One we see things like the Espionage Act, the Sedition Act. And recall during the French Revolution Federalists passed the Alien and Sedition Acts basically taking away rights from people at a time of alleged crisis. And once again during the Civil War you see Lincoln using his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus to try to keep the border states in the Union. And we're going to see this again and again. World War One is not the first time.

Now what is going to have a huge impact on the homefront? A lot of different groups are going to be impacted by the war. In fact African Americans -- we're already before the war even started kind of roughly in 1910 -- large migration of African Americans to northern cities like Chicago. And this is called the Great Migration, and you can see that in this painting right there.

There's a lot of reasons why African Americans are moving north: 1) crappy racial relations, Jim Crow laws in the south, and so you want to get out. But what changes during World War One is the opening of new economic opportunities -- jobs in northern factories as white men were drafted and sent off to war. During this time you also see an increase in Mexican immigration into the US to work in agriculture primarily in the southwest to take over jobs that were needed during the war effort.

Nearly 400,000 African Americans served in the US Armed Forces. They do unfortunately serve in segregated units. But civil rights leaders like W.E.B. Du Bois felt that if African Americans fought for the United States during the war that this would lead to greater equality when they returned. This unfortunately was not a reality as race riots break out in 1919. There's a lot of racial tension as a result of these demographic changes such as the Great Migration, and you have race riots break out in cities such as Chicago.

Women will play a key role in the war as well and will experience their own set of social changes. Women are going to take over jobs in factories as men leave. Jobs that were normally not open to women suddenly become available because the country needs them. In fact because of the sacrifices of women on the homefront during World War One you will see finally the two-thirds needed majority in Congress finally supporting the 19th Amendment which grants women's suffrage -- the right to vote. And great image right there of women protesting in front of the White House demanding for the basic rights such as voting.

As the war is winding down, Wilson has a vision for the post-war world which is known as the Fourteen Points. This is his proposal, and in it he really wants to prevent another world war from happening. He wants to address the causes of the first world war and try to make sure that those things never take place. There are 14 points in this document, but we're only going to break down some of the important ones.

So how's Wilson thinking he's going to accomplish this? Well he's going to address some of those causes of the first world war. He wants to guarantee freedom of the seas, eliminate economic trade barriers, military reductions -- no huge arms race is taking place. He wants to get rid of colonies -- in fact allow self-determination for nations to have self-government -- no more colonization. He wants no more secret treaties. And the big thing he really wants is he calls for the formation of a League of Nations to help prevent another war.

The problem for Wilson is he does not get to dictate the terms of the post-war settlement. He has to work with the Big Four -- includes Wilson over there on the right -- you have England, Italy and France. And these allies are not really idealistic as Wilson was. Here he is in the political cartoon kind of asking for everlasting peace, but for nations such as France and England they want to punish Germany, gain territory and use the war as an opportunity to benefit their country.

So while Wilson wants peace without victory, the other allies are not really interested in his idealistic ideas. So the Treaty of Versailles very much reflects this rejection of much of Wilson's Fourteen Points. They're rejected by the other Allied powers, and you can see in the political cartoon kind of some of the things that they want. Wilson does get the League of Nations included. He really kind of is hopeful that this will be a worldwide organization that will prevent future wars. But he has to get it approved by the Republican-controlled Congress.

And many Republicans in Congress hated the idea of the US joining the League of Nations. And one of the big opponents of the treaty was Henry Cabot Lodge, and he belonged to a group called the Reservationists. And he believed that he would accept the League of Nations -- he would accept the treaty -- if certain changes were made. And Wilson was reluctant to compromise. There was another group of Republicans known as the Irreconcilables, and they were against the treaty no matter what Wilson was willing to do.

There's substantial debate over the League of Nations between Wilson and the Senate, and it comes down to a couple of things: 1) there's a tradition of isolationist policies -- we try to avoid European affairs. If you recall George Washington had warned about the dangers of permanent foreign alliances. Another problem with the League of Nations amongst Republicans was the opposition over Article 10. And under Article 10 it said that member nations of the League of Nations would have to help other nations out in the event of external aggression. And there was a fear -- as you could see in the political cartoon -- that the League would force the US to deal with foreign issues around Europe -- that we get dragged into Europe's mess. And there also was the fear that Europe would meddle in the Western Hemisphere which under the Monroe Doctrine we did not want them to do.

Another kind of factor amongst Republicans and others was the desire amongst many to be isolationist following World War One. We fought this brutal horrible war, and there was a feeling we just kind of wanted to focus on us. And ultimately Congress rejects the treaty. The League of Nations is formed and without the United States -- a super important point to keep in mind.

There's an old World War One tank. Many mark the U.S. rejection of the League of Nations as a withdrawal of the U.S. from international affairs in the 1920s. And as we're going to see in the next video, this is a little bit more complicated than that.
