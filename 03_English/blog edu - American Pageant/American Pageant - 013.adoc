what up APUSH home boys and home girls? today we’re going to take a look at the period 1790 to 1860 and in particular the Market Revolution 市场革命 - the rise of a national economy 国民经济. if you’re looking at the APUSH textbooks, these are the ones that this lecture lines up with, so let’s get started.

what the heck is this Market Revolution that you need to know about? one is regional specialization 区域专业化 - the different sections of the country are further developing into distinct economies: the North is going through an industrial revolution 工业革命 (the rise of factories 工厂 and the mills 磨坊); the West is continuing to kind of be the nation’s bread basket 粮仓 (and agriculture 农业，especially wheat 小麦 and livestock 牲畜，is going to play a key role in this region); and in the South we have the cash crop economy 经济作物经济 (and in the South it’s going to be all about cotton 棉花).

you’re also going to see the development of all sorts of new technology which is going to assist in economic development, and new transportation improvements which are going to link the country up. you’re going to have a huge population increase - the population of the United States is going to dramatically increase. there’s going to be a very high birth rate 出生率，but also the role of immigration 移民 (particularly from Ireland, Germany, and also England and other countries), so immigration is going to allow this American population to increase.

you’re going to see the growth of cities - cities like New York, Chicago, and New Orleans are going to dramatically increase their population. and with this also comes western expansion 西进扩张，and western expansion is going to bring issues into the nation, especially political issues such as slavery 奴隶制. and then finally, economic changes had impact on migration patterns 移民模式 (kind of where people went, why they went there), gender and family relations 性别与家庭关系，and class relations 阶级关系 within the country (you have a growing gap 差距 between the wealthy and the not - so - wealthy).

immigration is a key part of this story. if you look at the graph, especially in the 1840s, huge increase - and there’s this spike 激增 in immigration during this time period. there’s lots of land in America, so people in Europe (where they don’t have this access to cheap land) are going to be coming over. you also have jobs in the factories (especially in the North) - that’s why overwhelmingly 压倒性地 the immigrant population is going to settle in northern areas. and of course America is known for its freedom and opportunity - even though things weren’t perfect in America, they were a heck of a lot better than they were over in monarch - dominated Europe 君主统治的欧洲.

and then really the Irish are going to come in in huge numbers especially in the mid - 1840s because of of course the event known as the Irish Potato Famine 爱尔兰大饥荒. the Irish in fact are largely going to settle in cities (especially cities like Boston, New York). you’re going to have these immigrants often times doing the hard labor 繁重劳动 for extremely low wages 工资 - they are the kind of bulk 主体 of that labor force 劳动力. the Irish are going to be the kind of big victims 受害者 of a lot of prejudice 偏见 (nativism 本土主义，which we’ll talk about in just a moment). there’s this idea that amongst native - born Americans that they must be stealing jobs since they’re willing to work for such low wages. there’s also a strong streak of anti - Catholic feelings - many of the Irish immigrants who came were Catholic 天主教徒，and there’s this feeling that somehow they’re going to be dictated politically by the Vatican 梵蒂冈 and the pope 教皇.

and then really important is the role of immigrants (especially the Irish) in politics - they’re going to largely support the Democratic party 民主党，and in places like New York going to play a key role in the electoral process 选举过程. the Tammany Hall 坦慕尼协会 in New York City (the political machine 政治机器 known as Tammany Hall) is a great example of immigrants and the role of immigrants in the vote.

the German immigrants are kind of the second most largest group coming in during this time, and the German immigrants who come are a very diverse group. Germany is not a nation at this time - it’s not a unified nation 统一的国家. there’s a mix of religions: you have Protestant 新教徒，Catholic, Jewish Germans. you have a wide variety of social classes - whereas the Irish tended to come over largely kind of poorer immigrants, there is all sorts of middle - class Germans coming over: artisans 工匠，farmers, and so on. they’re going to settle largely in the old Northwest, buying up land and settling in farms, but also in some cities as well. and they’re going to establish these German communities like in for instance in St. Louis - very vibrant 充满活力的 German community during this period of time.

as a result of all this immigration, you’re going to have the rise of nativist groups 本土主义团体 in America. the arguments kind of already went over, but this idea that they must be taking jobs from native Americans, that they’re going to influence the electoral process by out - voting native - born Americans, they’re going to ruin American culture with all their weird German language and their Irish customs 习俗，and there’s this feeling that they’re somehow going to destroy the fabric 结构 of America. the Catholic thing (especially for the Irish) plays a key role in this rise of nativist sentiment 情绪.

and you get political parties forming such as the Order of the Star - Spangled Banner (more commonly referred to as the Know - Nothing Party 一无所知党), and they basically wanted to restrict 限制 and they advocated for 倡导 the restrictions on immigrants and immigration. but a key thing happening during this time is America is becoming more and more ethnically 种族地 and racially 人种地 diverse - it’s always been a nation of a lot of different people, this period you see that further development.

big idea in this period is the diverging economic systems 不同的经济体系 - the North, the West, the South - they’re developing regional economic specializations, and very often during this time period regional political and economic loyalties 忠诚 often continue to overshadow 使…… 显得不重要 national concerns. so these regions are kind of developing distinct from one another, and they’re really worried about the development of their region, not the nation as a whole.

Northern manufacturing 制造业’s key during the Market Revolution. you get a guy by the name of Samuel Slater comes over in the 1790s - he memorized the plans for the machinery 机械 from England and smuggles 偷运 those ideas over here. he is known as the father of the factory system - he establishes Slater Mill in Rhode Island. during this time you also get people like Eli Whitney and his interchangeable parts 可互换零件，which allows for mass production 大规模生产 in factories (which allows also for greater efficiency 效率). and other inventions play a key role - Samuel Morse develops the telegraph 电报 in 1844, which is a revolution in communication (you’re able to communicate much more rapidly than ever before).

factory work in the North was very difficult - this is a huge shift 转变 in the country. people are not just working as apprentices 学徒 in homes - they’re going to a factory, and this work is very difficult: long hours, low wages, and dangerous (completely unregulated 未受监管的). and you go from kind of semi - subsistence agriculture 半自给农业 to what some refer to as wage slaves 工资奴隶 - the very kind of critical view of factory work that you are just the slave for low wages.

one of the most famous examples of this factory model 工厂模式 is in Lowell, Massachusetts - the Lowell system 洛厄尔体系. and in the beginning it is worked by New England farm daughters - they were sent to the factory. later on it will be Irish women, but very tightly regulated - every aspect of life was regulated for these workers in Lowell.

unions 工会 are going to really struggle in the beginning, but they win a key court case 法庭案件 in the Massachusetts Supreme Court with Commonwealth v. Hunt (make sure you know about that), and it basically says labor unions are allowed. and even though they get this court case, there is not going to be a major labor union movement till way later on in American history. but the impact is key - the North is developing manufacturing, and this is going to play a key role once we get to the Civil War 内战 because they’re going to have a clear economic advantage 优势 in the manufacturing realm 领域 once the war starts against the South.

another key part of the Market Revolution is the transportation revolution 交通革命. the steamboat 汽船 is invented - the first one in 1807 by Robert Fulton. this dramatically changes transportation costs 运输成本 because now you can go upstream 逆流而上 and downstream 顺流而下 for a very low price comparatively speaking, so transportation becomes cheaper.

you get the building of turnpikes 收费公路 and roads - the National Road (the Cumberland Road) is built in 1811, which allows goods and people to move much more efficiently. you have a huge canal 运河 boom 繁荣 in the 1820s and 1830s - the most famous being the Erie Canal 伊利运河，linking up the Great Lakes 五大湖 with the Hudson River 哈得逊河. and all these different canals are being built in this two - decade period. unfortunately with canals, they’re very costly; it gets cold, the water freezes - so later on you’re going to get the development of the railroads 铁路，especially in the 1830s and '40s. railroads are much faster, they’re more reliable 可靠的，and they’re cheaper, and you’re going to have an explosion 激增 of railroad construction really in the North as well.

the impact of the transportation revolution: you’re going to get the development of a continental economy 大陆经济. goods and people and markets are being extended, and by 1860 the country is linked up like never before. however, this does bring up new issues: who should pay for it - the federal or state governments? during the American system, some of those traditional Democratic - Republicans said "no we will not pay," which is why bills like the Maysville Road Bill 梅斯维尔公路法案 would be vetoed 否决.

western expansion is a key theme during this time period. here you have in 1790 the population density 人口密度，and here it is by 1830 - people are moving west. this new transportation allows that to take place, but you also have new inventions - a revolution in the field. McCormick invents the McCormick Reaper 麦考密克收割机 in 1831, which allows crops 庄稼 to be gathered much more efficiently. you have John Deere inventing the steel plow 钢犁 in 1837, which allows farmers to break through the soil 土壤 much easier. and as a result, the consequences 后果 is you have this transition 转变 to large - scale farming 大规模农业 for profit, and with that comes a demand for more land and more machinery 机械，which increases debt 债务 amongst farmers. yes, they’re being more efficient, but you have to pay more capital 资金 in order to become one of these big farmers. and of course for people in the West, you’re going to continually want the federal government to provide you better transportation so that you can get access to new markets.

a really significant invention happens in 1793 by a guy by the name of Eli Whitney - the cotton gin 轧棉机. and the cotton gin just basically allows for cotton production 棉花生产 to dramatically increase in efficiency. and the cotton gin (which separates the seed 种子 from the cotton) creates a huge demand for slaves. slavery was kind of dying out, but the cotton gin suddenly makes cotton production way more profitable 有利可图的，and as a result it’s important to keep in mind this cotton (which is picked in the South by slave labor 奴隶劳动) is being sent to Northern factories and British factories - they are the ones buying this raw material 原材料.

some random big ideas for these chapters: Southern cotton will be the raw material for manufacturing in the North - these economies are linked together. we often times think about them (North no slavery, South slavery), but they are connected economically. this is going to lead to an increase in the internal slave trade 国内奴隶贸易 - slave trade was banned 禁止 in 1808 from abroad, but slaves are going to be sold constantly especially as the nation moves west.

the transformation 转变 from a subsistence economy 自给经济 of tiny farms and workshops 作坊 to a national network 网络 of industry and commerce 商业 is going to take place during this time period. and of course with that, you’re going to have changes in the family dynamics 家庭动态 as women and children leave the home to work in factories. but you’re still going to have this cult of domesticity 家庭崇拜 where this idea that women’s place is in the home raising young children to be good citizens one day (Republican Motherhood 共和母亲理念).

those are the big ideas. thank you for watching - hopefully you learned a little bit. help a homie out and subscribe to Joe’s Productions. peace.

各位APUSH的兄弟姐妹们，今天我们要探讨1790年至1860年这段时期，特别是市场革命——民族经济的崛起。如果你正在学习APUSH的教科书，这次讲座与以下几本教材的内容相符，让我们开始吧。

到底什么是你需要了解的市场革命呢？一是地区专业化——国家的不同区域进一步发展成为独特的经济体：北方正在经历工业革命（工厂和纺织厂的兴起）；西部继续是国家的粮仓（农业，特别是小麦和牲畜，将在这个地区发挥关键作用）；而在南方，我们有以经济作物为主的经济（在南方，一切都将围绕棉花展开）。

你还将看到各种新技术的出现，这将有助于经济发展，以及将国家连接起来的新交通运输改进。人口将大幅增加——美国的人口将急剧增长。出生率会非常高，但移民的作用也不可忽视（特别是来自爱尔兰、德国以及英国和其他国家），因此，移民将使美国人口得以增长。

你将看到城市的发展——像纽约、芝加哥和新奥尔良这样的人口将急剧增加。随之而来的是西进运动，而西进运动将给国家带来问题，特别是像奴隶制这样的政治问题。最后，经济变化影响了移民模式（人们去了哪里，为什么去那里），性别和家庭关系，以及国内的阶级关系（富人和不太富裕的人之间的差距越来越大）。

移民是这个故事的关键部分。如果你看一下图表，尤其是在1840年代，出现了巨大的增长——这一时期移民数量激增。美国有很多土地，所以欧洲那些无法获得廉价土地的人将来到这里。你还可以在工厂找到工作（尤其是在北方）——这就是为什么绝大多数移民将定居在北方地区。当然，美国以其自由和机会而闻名——尽管在美国情况并非完美，但与君主统治的欧洲相比，情况要好得多。

然后，爱尔兰人将大量涌入，尤其是在1840年代中期，这当然是因为众所周知的爱尔兰马铃薯饥荒。事实上，爱尔兰人主要定居在城市（特别是像波士顿、纽约这样的城市）。你经常会看到这些移民从事艰苦的劳动，工资却极低——他们是劳动力的大部分。爱尔兰人将成为许多偏见（本土主义，我们稍后会谈到）的主要受害者。在美国本土出生的美国人中有一种观点认为，既然他们愿意以如此低的工资工作，那么他们一定是在抢走工作。还有强烈的反天主教情绪——许多爱尔兰移民是天主教徒，人们认为他们会在政治上受到梵蒂冈和教皇的支配。

然后，移民（特别是爱尔兰人）在政治中的作用非常重要——他们将主要支持民主党，并在像纽约这样的地方在选举过程中发挥关键作用。纽约市的坦慕尼协会（被称为坦慕尼协会的政治机器）是移民及其在投票中的作用的一个很好的例子。

德国移民是这一时期第二大移民群体，而德国移民是一个非常多元化的群体。当时的德国还不是一个统一的国家。宗教信仰混杂：有新教徒、天主教徒和犹太德国人。社会阶层也各不相同——虽然爱尔兰移民往往是较为贫穷的移民，但也有各种各样的中产阶级德国人来到这里：工匠、农民等等。他们主要定居在旧西北部，购买土地并在农场定居，但也定居在一些城市。他们将建立像圣路易斯这样的德国社区——在这一时期，这是一个非常活跃的德国社区。

由于所有这些移民，你将在美国看到本土主义团体的兴起。我们已经讨论过这些论点，但这种观点认为他们一定是在抢走美国本土人的工作，他们将通过比美国本土出生的美国人更多的选票来影响选举进程，他们将用他们奇怪的德语和爱尔兰习俗来破坏美国文化，并且人们认为他们将以某种方式摧毁美国的结构。天主教问题（特别是对于爱尔兰人）在本土主义情绪的兴起中起着关键作用。

你还会看到一些政党的形成，比如“星条旗令”（更常被称为“一无所知党”），他们基本上想要限制并主张限制移民。但这一时期发生的一个关键事情是，美国正变得越来越具有民族和种族多样性——它一直是一个由许多不同的人组成的国家，而这一时期你看到了这种进一步的发展。

这一时期的核心思想是经济体系的分化——北方、西部和南方——它们正在发展区域经济专业化，而这一时期，区域政治和经济忠诚往往继续掩盖国家利益。因此，这些区域彼此独立发展，它们真正关心的是自己区域的发展，而不是整个国家。

北方制造业在市场革命中至关重要。一个名叫塞缪尔·斯莱特的家伙在1790年代来到美国——他记住了英国机器的图纸，并将这些想法偷偷带到了这里。他被称为“工厂制度之父”——他在罗德岛建立了斯莱特工厂。在此期间，你还看到了像伊莱·惠特尼和他的可互换零件这样的人，这使得工厂能够进行大规模生产（这也提高了效率）。其他发明也发挥了关键作用——塞缪尔·莫尔斯在1844年发明了电报，这是一场通信革命（你能够以前所未有的速度进行通信）。

北方工厂的工作非常艰苦——这是国家的一次巨大转变。人们不再只是在家里当学徒——他们去工厂工作，而这项工作非常艰苦：工作时间长，工资低，而且危险（完全没有监管）。你从半自给自足的农业转向一些人所说的“工资奴隶”——这是对工厂工作非常批判的看法，认为你只是为了低工资而当奴隶。

这种工厂模式最著名的例子之一是马萨诸塞州的洛厄尔——洛厄尔制度。最初，工厂的工人是新英格兰的农场女儿——她们被送到工厂工作。后来将是爱尔兰妇女，但受到非常严格的监管——在洛厄尔，这些工人的生活的方方面面都受到监管。

工会在初期将面临真正的困难，但他们在马萨诸塞州最高法院的联邦诉亨特案中赢得了一场关键的诉讼（务必了解这一点），该案基本上裁定工会是合法的。尽管他们赢得了这场诉讼，但在美国历史上很久以后才会出现大规模的工会运动。但其影响是关键的——北方正在发展制造业，一旦我们进入内战时期，这将发挥关键作用，因为一旦与南方开战，他们将在制造业领域拥有明显的经济优势。

市场革命的另一个关键部分是交通运输革命。汽船被发明出来——第一艘是罗伯特·富尔顿在1807年发明的。这极大地改变了运输成本，因为现在你可以以相对较低的价格逆流而上和顺流而下，因此运输变得更便宜。

收费公路和道路开始修建——1811年修建了国家公路（坎伯兰公路），这使得货物和人员的流动更加高效。1820年代和1830年代出现了运河建设的热潮——最著名的是伊利运河，它将五大湖与哈德逊河连接起来。在这二十年间，修建了所有这些不同的运河。不幸的是，运河成本非常高昂；天气变冷，水会结冰——因此，后来你将看到铁路的发展，尤其是在1830年代和1840年代。铁路更快、更可靠、更便宜，而且你将在北方看到铁路建设的蓬勃发展。

交通运输革命的影响：你将看到大陆经济的发展。商品、人员和市场正在扩大，到1860年，国家的联系达到了前所未有的程度。然而，这带来了新的问题：谁应该为此付费——联邦政府还是州政府？在美国体系时期，一些传统的民主共和党人说“不，我们不会付费”，这就是像梅斯维尔公路法案这样的议案会被否决的原因。

西进运动是这一时期的关键主题。这里是1790年的人口密度，这里是1830年的人口密度——人们正在向西迁移。新的交通运输使得这一切成为可能，但你也有新的发明——农业领域的革命。麦考密克在1831年发明了麦考密克收割机，这使得农作物的收割效率大大提高。约翰·迪尔在1837年发明了钢犁，这使得农民更容易耕作土地。结果是，你看到了向大规模盈利性农业的转变，随之而来的是对更多土地和更多机械的需求，这增加了农民的债务。是的，他们的效率更高了，但你必须投入更多的资本才能成为这些大农场主之一。当然，对于西部的人们来说，你将不断希望联邦政府为你提供更好的交通运输，以便你能进入新的市场。

1793年，一个名叫伊莱·惠特尼的人发明了一项非常重要的东西——轧棉机。轧棉机基本上使得棉花生产的效率大大提高。轧棉机（将棉籽从棉花中分离出来）极大地增加了对奴隶的需求。奴隶制当时正在逐渐消亡，但轧棉机突然使棉花生产变得更有利可图，因此，务必记住，这些棉花（由南方奴隶劳动力采摘）被运往北方工厂和英国工厂——他们是购买这种原材料的人。

这些章节的一些随机的重要思想：南方棉花将是北方制造业的原材料——这些经济体是相互联系的。我们经常认为它们是分开的（北方没有奴隶制，南方有奴隶制），但它们在经济上是联系在一起的。这将导致国内奴隶贸易的增加——1808年禁止了来自国外的奴隶贸易，但奴隶将不断被出售，尤其是在国家向西扩张的过程中。

从小型农场和作坊的自给自足经济向工业和商业的全国性网络的转变将发生在这个时期。当然，随之而来的是家庭动态的变化，因为妇女和儿童离开家去工厂工作。但你仍然会看到“家庭崇拜”的观念，即妇女的地位是在家里抚养幼儿，使他们有一天成为好公民（共和母亲）。

这些是核心思想。感谢观看——希望你学到了一些东西。帮帮你的朋友，订阅乔氏出品。再见。

what up APUSH home boys and home girls?
today we're going to take a look at the
period 1790 to 1860 and in particular
the Market Revolution - the rise of a
national economy. if you're looking at
the APUSH textbooks, these are the ones
that this lecture lines up with, so let's
get started.

what the heck is this Market
Revolution that you need to know about?
one is regional specialization - the
different sections of the country are
further developing into distinct
economies: the North is going through
an industrial revolution (the rise of
factories and the mills); the West is
continuing to kind of be the nation's
bread basket (and agriculture, especially
wheat and livestock, is going to play a
key role in this region); and in the South
we have the cash crop economy (and in the
South it's going to be all about cotton).

you're also going to see the development
of all sorts of new technology which is
going to assist in economic development,
and new transportation improvements
which are going to link the country up.
you're going to have a huge population
increase - the population of the
United States is going to dramatically
increase. there's going to be a very high
birth rate, but also the role of
immigration (particularly from Ireland,
Germany, and also England and other
countries), so immigration is going to
allow this American population to
increase.

you're going to see the growth
of cities - cities like New York,
Chicago, and New Orleans are going to
dramatically increase their population.
and with this also comes western
expansion, and western expansion is going
to bring issues into the nation,
especially political issues such as
slavery. and then finally, economic
changes had impact on migration patterns
(kind of where people went, why they went
there), gender and family relations, and
class relations within the country (you
have a growing gap between the wealthy
and the not-so-wealthy).

immigration is a
key part of this story. if you look at
the graph, especially in the 1840s, huge
increase - and there's this spike in
immigration during this time period.
there's lots of land in America, so
people in Europe (where they don't have
this access to cheap land) are going to
be coming over. you also have jobs in the
factories (especially in the North) - that's
why overwhelmingly the immigrant
population is going to settle in
northern areas. and of course America is
known for its freedom and opportunity -
even though things weren't perfect in
America, they were a heck of a lot better
than they were over in monarch-dominated
Europe.

and then really the Irish are
going to come in in huge numbers
especially in the mid-1840s because of
of course the event known as the Irish
Potato Famine. the Irish in fact are largely
going to settle in cities (especially
cities like Boston, New York). you're going
to have these immigrants often times
doing the hard labor for extremely low
wages - they are the kind of bulk of that
labor force. the Irish are going to be
the kind of big victims of a lot of
prejudice (nativism, which we'll talk
about in just a moment). there's this idea
that amongst native-born Americans that
they must be stealing jobs since they're
willing to work for such low wages.
there's also a strong streak of
anti-Catholic feelings - many of the Irish
immigrants who came were Catholic, and
there's this feeling that somehow
they're going to be dictated
politically by the Vatican and the pope.

and then really important is the role of
immigrants (especially the Irish) in
politics - they're going to largely
support the Democratic party, and in
places like New York going to play a key
role in the electoral process. the Tammany
Hall in New York City (the political
machine known as Tammany Hall) is a great
example of immigrants and the role of
immigrants in the vote.

the German
immigrants are kind of the second most
largest group coming in during this time,
and the German immigrants who come are a
very diverse group. Germany is not a
nation at this time - it's not a
unified nation. there's a mix of
religions: you have Protestant, Catholic,
Jewish Germans. you have a wide variety
of social classes - whereas the Irish
tended to come over largely kind of
poorer immigrants, there is all sorts of middle-
class Germans coming over:
artisans, farmers, and so on. they're going
to settle largely in the old Northwest,
buying up land and settling in farms, but
also in some cities as well. and they're
going to establish these German
communities like in for instance in St.
Louis - very vibrant German community
during this period of time.

as a result
of all this immigration, you're going to
have the rise of nativist groups
in America. the arguments kind of
already went over, but this idea that
they must be taking jobs from native
Americans, that they're going to
influence the electoral process by out-
voting native-born Americans, they're going
to ruin American culture with all their
weird German language and their Irish
customs, and there's this feeling that
they're somehow going to destroy the
fabric of America. the Catholic thing
(especially for the Irish) plays a key
role in this rise of nativist sentiment.

and you get political parties forming
such as the Order of the
Star-Spangled Banner (more commonly
referred to as the Know-Nothing Party), and
they basically wanted to restrict and
they advocated for the restrictions on
immigrants and immigration. but a key
thing happening during this time is
America is becoming more and more
ethnically and racially diverse - it's
always been a nation of a lot of
different people, this period you see
that further
development.

big idea in this period is
the diverging economic systems - the North,
the West, the South - they're developing
regional economic specializations, and
very often during this time period
regional political and economic
loyalties often continue to overshadow
national concerns. so these regions are
kind of developing distinct from one
another, and they're really worried about
the development of their region, not the
nation as a whole.

Northern
manufacturing's key during the Market
Revolution. you get a guy by the name of
Samuel Slater comes over in the 1790s - he
memorized the plans for the machinery
from England and smuggles those ideas
over here. he is known as the father of
the factory system - he establishes
Slater Mill in Rhode Island. during this
time you also get people like Eli
Whitney and his interchangeable parts,
which allows for mass production in
factories (which allows also for greater
efficiency). and other inventions play a
key role - Samuel Morse develops the
telegraph in 1844, which is a revolution
in communication (you're able to
communicate much more rapidly than ever
before).

factory work in the North was
very difficult - this is a huge shift in
the country. people are not just working
as apprentices in homes - they're going
to a factory, and this work is very
difficult: long hours, low wages, and
dangerous (completely unregulated). and you
go from kind of semi-subsistence
agriculture to what some refer to as
wage slaves - the very kind of critical
view of factory work that you are just
the slave for low wages.

one of the
most famous examples of this factory
model is in Lowell, Massachusetts - the Lowell
system. and in the beginning it is worked
by New England farm daughters - they
were sent to the factory. later
on it will be Irish women, but very
tightly regulated - every aspect of life
was regulated for these workers in Lowell.

unions are going to really struggle in
the beginning, but they win a key court
case in the Massachusetts Supreme Court
with Commonwealth v. Hunt (make sure
you know about that), and it basically
says labor unions are allowed. and even
though they get this court case, there is
not going to be a major labor union
movement till way later on in
American history. but the impact is key -
the North is developing manufacturing,
and this is going to play a key role
once we get to the Civil War because
they're going to have a clear economic
advantage in the manufacturing
realm once the war starts against the
South.

another key part of the Market
Revolution is the transportation
revolution. the steamboat is invented - the
first one in 1807 by Robert Fulton. this
dramatically changes transportation
costs because now you can go upstream
and downstream for a very low price
comparatively speaking, so transportation
becomes cheaper.

you get the building of
turnpikes and roads - the National Road
(the Cumberland Road) is built in 1811,
which allows goods and people to move
much more efficiently. you have a huge
canal boom in the 1820s and 1830s - the
most famous being the Erie Canal,
linking up the
Great Lakes with the Hudson River. and
all these different canals are being
built in this two-decade period.
unfortunately with canals, they're very
costly; it gets cold, the water freezes - so
later on you're going to get the
development of the railroads, especially
in the 1830s and '40s. railroads are much
faster, they're more reliable, and they're
cheaper, and you're going to have an
explosion of railroad
construction really in the North as well.

the impact of the transportation
revolution: you're going to get the
development of a continental economy.
goods and people and markets are being
extended, and by 1860 the country is
linked up like never before. however, this
does bring up new issues: who should pay
for it - the federal or state governments?
during the American system, some of those
traditional Democratic-Republicans said
"no we will not pay," which is why bills
like the Maysville Road Bill would be
vetoed.

western expansion is a key theme
during this time period. here you have in
1790 the population density, and here it
is by 1830 - people are moving west. this
new transportation allows that to take
place, but you also have new inventions - a
revolution in the field. McCormick
invents the McCormick Reaper in 1831,
which allows crops to be gathered much
more efficiently. you have John
Deere inventing the steel plow in 1837,
which allows farmers to break through
the soil much easier. and as a result,
the consequences is you have this
transition to large-scale farming for
profit, and with that comes a demand for
more land and more machinery, which
increases debt amongst farmers. yes,
they're being more efficient, but you
have to pay more capital in order to
become one of these big farmers. and of
course for people in the West, you're
going to continually want the federal
government to provide you better
transportation so that you can get
access to new markets.

a really
significant invention happens in 1793 by
a guy by the name of Eli Whitney - the
cotton gin. and the cotton gin just
basically allows for cotton production
to dramatically increase in efficiency.
and the cotton gin (which separates the
seed from the cotton) creates a huge
demand for slaves. slavery was kind of
dying out, but the cotton gin suddenly
makes cotton production way more
profitable, and as a result it's
important to keep in mind this cotton
(which is picked in the South by slave
labor) is being sent to Northern
factories and British factories - they
are the ones buying this raw material.

some random big ideas for these
chapters: Southern cotton will be the raw
material for manufacturing in the North -
these economies are linked together. we
often times think about them (North no
slavery, South slavery), but they are
connected economically. this is going to
lead to an increase in the internal
slave trade - slave trade was banned in
1808 from abroad, but slaves are going to
be sold constantly especially as the
nation moves west.

the transformation
from a subsistence economy of tiny farms
and workshops to a national network of
industry and commerce is going to take
place during this time period. and of
course with that, you're going to have
changes in the family dynamics as
women and children leave the home to
work in factories. but you're still
going to have this cult of domesticity
where this idea that women's place is in
the home raising young children to be
good citizens one day (Republican
Motherhood).

those are the big ideas. thank
you for watching - hopefully you learned a
little bit. help a homie out and
subscribe to Joe's Productions. peace.
