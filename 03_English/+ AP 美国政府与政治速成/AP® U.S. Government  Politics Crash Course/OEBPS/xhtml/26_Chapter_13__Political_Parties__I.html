<p class="C2431"><strong>LINKAGE INSTITUTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>FUNCTION OF LINKAGE INSTITUTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Linkage institutions are organizations or systems through which people connect and interact with the government.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Linkage institutions provide legitimate channels for the flow of information between the government and citizens, allowing for peaceful interaction in policy development.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>TYPES OF LINKAGE INSTITUTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Political Parties:</strong> These are organizations of people who share similar political ideologies which attempt to gain political power and implement a policy agenda by getting candidates elected.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Interest Groups:</strong> These are organizations of people who share similar causes or concerns which attempt to influence the government to address specific problems and public policies.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Elections:</strong> The primary method of participation in a democracy is the election, a contest in which citizens vote to select political representatives.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Media:</strong> The news media includes all those sources through which information is published including Internet, print, and broadcast news sources.</p>
<p class="C2409"><span class="C617"><strong>II.</strong></span></p>
<p class="C2431"><strong>POLITICAL PARTIES</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE THREE ROLES OF POLITICAL PARTIES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Party in the Organization.</strong> Political parties exist to promote a political agenda. They accomplish this goal by recruiting and <span id="page_200"/>running candidates for office, raising money, and maintaining an administrative structure to carry out party functions.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Party in the Electorate.</strong> Political parties reach out to voters, work to develop stable coalitions, and function as shorthand, or a label that conveys information about candidates and politicians to voters.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Party in Government.</strong> Members of a political party who are currently serving in government positions work to achieve the party’s policy goals. Many aspects of government, notably Congress, are organized by political party. Party affiliation determines leadership positions and committee memberships.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FUNCTIONS OF POLITICAL PARTIES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Political parties educate and mobilize voters to participate in elections.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Parties sponsor and organize activities to inform and motivate voters.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Parties recruit and train volunteers.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Party names are understood by voters to correspond to core sets of values. A candidate’s party affiliation is reliable shorthand for his or her policy views.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Political parties develop platforms, which are statements of principles explaining the party’s policy goals.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Political parties recruit candidates to run for office.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Party organizations are often able to influence qualified and talented candidates to run.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Parties serve a seal-of-approval function. The endorsement of the party is understood to provide assurance that the candidate is a good citizen and qualified for the office that he or she is seeking.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Political parties provide campaign support for their nominees.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>During the primary stage of an election, the party’s role is to moderate the contest among its own member candidates for the party’s nomination to each office on each ballot.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>During the general election campaign, parties provide several types of assistance to candidates, including:</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>campaign management expertise</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>media strategy</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><span id="page_201"/>➤</span>voter information databases</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>scientific polling</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>canvassing and get-out-the-vote events</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>direct campaign contributions or financial support (within legal limits)</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Political parties are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their efforts to target and influence voters.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Parties maintain and continuously update detailed databases of voter profiles using information from scientific polling, census records, and other data sources.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Parties use sophisticated software and computer models to tailor messages and advertising strategies based on the psychological and demographic characteristics of specific voter groups they are targeting.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Parties use social media to efficiently spread targeted messaging.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>Parties organize and manage many of the operations of government.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Although political parties are not mentioned in the Constitution, they play a major role in the operation of government.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>The majority party in Congress holds the key leadership positions and committee chair roles, effectively determining Congress’s agenda.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>The majority parties in state legislatures hold similar positions and control the redistricting process, which may confer a significant electoral advantage in future congressional elections.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>The party out of power, or the minority party, plays a vital role as a watchdog, actively scrutinizing and criticizing the party in power to ensure against abuses of power.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The United States has a two-party system.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Political parties are not discussed in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Nothing in U.S. law requires the two-party system or prohibits other parties from competing.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566"><span id="page_202"/>c.</span>Due to the structure of our electoral system, the vast majority of political offices are held by members of the two major parties.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>The two major parties have changed over time. Since 1860, the Democratic and Republican parties have dominated American politics.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>In order to achieve and maintain major party status, a party must create a party coalition, a collection of voting groups that support the party’s policies and candidates. Examples of important voting groups include African Americans, women, blue-collar workers, the LGBTQ community, Christian evangelicals, and others.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Coalitions are generally stable, but they may change over time.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Group connections to political parties may change. This happened during the Great Depression when large numbers of traditionally Republican voters, including African Americans, began voting Democratic in large numbers, in a process known as realignment.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Parties may modify their positions and messaging to appeal to specific groups.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Conversely, a new constituency (group of loyal voters) may influence changes in a party’s policy positions.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>Critical elections are those in which a major and lasting realignment of group loyalties is seen. These occur in times marked by national crisis or major social movements, as when several important voting groups left the Republican Party and united behind FDR.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span>Realignments may also be regional, as when conservative white southerners began to switch in the late 1960s from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Realignment, dealignment, and critical elections are terms that can be confusing, but they are important to understand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="C1237"><span class="C566a">➤</span><strong>Realignment <em>refers to the switching of party loyalty by important voting groups.</em></strong></p>
<p class="C1237"><span class="C566a">➤</span><strong>Critical elections <em>are those in which a major realignment of important voting groups takes place, so that the party that had been weaker becomes dominant.</em></strong></p>
<p class="C1237"><span class="C566a">➤</span><strong>Dealignment <em>describes the process of voters detaching from political parties and becoming independent.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_203"/>4<span class="C566">.</span>Recent decades have seen a decrease in the power of the major parties.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Beginning in the 1960s, voters’ party loyalties began to weaken (dealignment). Increasingly, voters identified as independent, rather than as Democrats or Republicans.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Generally, national party organizations have a loose relationship with state and local party organizations. National parties do not hold authority over state and local parties, and, in fact, influence often runs in the other direction.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Campaign finance restrictions have reduced the power of political parties by limiting party donations to candidates ($5,000 per federal candidate per election cycle, combined $10,000 for primary and general elections).</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Campaigns have become more candidate-centered and less focused on parties.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>In many other democracies, candidates for offices are chosen by party leaders rather than voters. In the U.S. system, candidates for office are chosen by party members and highly engaged voters in primary elections.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Traditionally, candidates have relied heavily on party support in the form of financial and campaign assistance, ensuring their loyalty.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>More recently, individuals interested in running for office frequently solicit donations and hire their own professional campaign staffs, allowing them to be more independent.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The influence of political parties in determining voters’ choices has declined. Voters are less loyal to parties in general (dealignment) and more likely to vote with a split-ticket.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Political party leadership generally prefers candidates who are more centrist, making them more likely to appeal to moderate voters.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Political party members are more ideologically driven than the general public, making them more prone to select candidates who are more ideologically pronounced.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Candidates have access to television and other forms of media. They can appeal directly to voters and spread their messages without the support of party structures.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><span id="page_204"/>➤</span>Voters are now more likely to be influenced by individual candidates’ messages and to vote for candidates of different parties.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>It is easy to assume that the national party organizations control the state and local party organizations, but this is not true. Remember that parties in the United States are decentralized (state and local political party organizations are not controlled by the national party). This weak organizational system means that local parties choose their own candidates for office and are not obligated to follow party platform positions, allowing for candidate selection based on local preferences.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MINOR (THIRD) PARTIES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The United States has evolved a political system in which two parties dominate, but numerous minor parties (also called third parties) exist and compete.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>The two-party system is not required by law; however, the way U.S. elections are held makes it difficult for minor parties to compete.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Some countries have proportional representation systems in which citizens vote for parties rather than individual candidates, and each party receives a number of legislative seats in proportion to its share of the popular vote. Proportional representation systems allow multiple parties to hold political power.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>In U.S. congressional elections, each voter has one vote, and the candidate who wins the most votes is the winner, even if that candidate received less than a majority of the votes cast (a plurality). This is called a single-member plurality system. It is also called the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>The one-voter-one-vote system leads invariably to a two-party system by influencing voters to vote for a stronger party that is more likely to win an election, rather than a smaller party that has almost no chance of winning the most votes in a district, thus allowing the two major parties to remain dominant.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>In presidential elections, all but two states (Maine and Nebraska) allocate all of their electoral votes to the popular <span id="page_205"/>vote winner. Because this winner-take-all method is used in most states, it is almost impossible for a minor party candidate to win a plurality of votes within a state, and the state’s electoral votes.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span>The two major parties also actively work to prevent minor parties from achieving equal status.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Minor party candidates are required to achieve 15% support in order to qualify for participation in televised presidential debates.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Candidates are required to collect minimum numbers of signatures in order to appear on a ballot. This is a greater challenge for minor party candidates who have fewer resources.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">g.</span>The two major parties are extremely well-funded and highly organized, making it difficult for smaller parties to compete.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Despite the challenges, minor parties occasionally win elections. Minor parties, especially the Socialist, Green, and Libertarian parties, have often won local and state elections, as well as federal seats.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Minor parties serve several functions in the United States.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Minor parties can be agents of innovation. Because they generally focus on smaller, more ideological groups, they are free to adopt positions that are more outside the mainstream and bring innovative ideas to the public.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Minor parties can motivate voters who are unhappy with their major party choices.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Minor parties can influence the political agenda.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>When a minor party receives support, the major parties take notice, and may adopt the minor party’s positions. For example, the Democratic Party has been influenced by the Green Party’s focus on the environment.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>This process of major parties co-opting minor party issues further diminishes minor parties’ electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Minor party candidates may have a spoiler effect; that is, they may draw a significant portion of the vote from other candidates. If a minor party candidate draws enough votes from a major party candidate, he or she may hand the election to the other major party. For example, in the presidential election of 1992, George H.W. Bush ran for the Republicans, <span id="page_206"/>and Bill Clinton ran for the Democrats. H. (Henry) Ross Perot, a businessman and billionaire, ran as an independent. The results were as follows:</p>

<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Perot, a conservative, drew votes primarily from Bush. Had he not run, most of those who voted for him would have voted for Bush, altering the outcome of the election (the spoiler effect).</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Even though Perot made a very strong run, drawing nearly 20% of the popular vote, he failed to win any electoral votes, illustrating the challenge that the winner-take-all system presents for minor parties.</p>

<p class="C2431"><strong>INTEREST GROUPS</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>TYPES OF INTEREST GROUPS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups are organizations of people who come together to advance a common cause.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_207"/>2<span class="C566">.</span>Freedom of association is the right of individuals to unite with others for expressive or political purposes. Although not specifically listed in the First Amendment, is has been recognized by the Court as a protected right related to the freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups form around different types of issues, including economics, group welfare, professional membership, recreational interests, single issues, and areas of public concern. Some groups fall into multiple categories.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Labor unions formed to address the conditions of working people, including safety, hours, and compensation. Examples of labor unions include the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which merged in 1955 to form the AFL-CIO.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Business organizations exist to promote the collective interest of businesses and generally oppose regulation and legislation promoting workers’ rights. The United States Chamber of Commerce has more than three million member businesses and promotes a wide variety of business interests. Other groups, such as the National Association of Manufacturers, represent smaller segments of the economy.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Professionals form interest groups for economic and other professional reasons. These include the American Bar Association (ABA) and the American Medical Association (AMA).</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Agriculture has traditionally been recognized as a unique economic interest, and there are many agricultural interest groups, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation. In recent years, changes in this economic sector have created conflicts between the interests of traditional small and mid-sized farms and large-scale agribusiness.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>Environmental groups advance environmental protections. Examples include the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span>Consumer groups advocate for the interests of consumers generally. Examples include Consumers Union, which provides product information and publishes <em>Consumer Reports</em>; and the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), which advocates for food safety.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">g.</span>Interest groups also form to protect and advance group welfare on a societal level or for ideological reasons. Such groups include the National Organization for Women (NOW), <span id="page_208"/>formed in 1966 to advance women’s rights; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), established to promote the civil rights of African Americans; and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), which promotes the interests of older Americans.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">h.</span>Single-issue groups focus on one specific concern. Examples include the National Rifle Association (NRA) and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C1436">i.</span>Government interest groups are composed of representatives of state and local government organizations. An example is the National Governors Association (NGA).</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups can form around very narrow issues, such as the protection of a particular species; or around broad issues, such as environmental protection generally.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Recall that Madison, in “Federalist No. 10,” addressed the commonly held concern that factions were both dangerous and inevitable. Madison argued that in a large republic multiple factions would compete, ensuring that none would be dominant. He also believed that the negative effects of factions would be mitigated through the decisions of a sophisticated group of elected representatives, the separation of power among the three branches, and the system of federalism, which allowed for issues to be addressed at the appropriate level of government (multiple access points).</strong></em></p>

<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>LOBBYING: HOW INTEREST GROUPS INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span><em>Lobbying</em> describes the various activities in which interest groups engage in order to influence government officials.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups offer financial support to candidates’ campaigns.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Interest groups form political action committees, or PACs. Through their PACs, interest groups offer financial contributions to politicians’ campaigns. These types of contributions are limited by law to $5,000 per candidate per election cycle (combined $10,000 for primary and general elections).</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>In addition to direct contributions, interest groups frequently offer indirect financial support to politicians. They may do this by donating to political parties or by sponsoring political <span id="page_209"/>advertising, so long as they do not coordinate their messaging with the candidate or campaign.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups may offer to endorse a candidate, encouraging their members to vote for the candidate.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups educate politicians by conducting research, providing data and information.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups frequently write legislation and provide draft legislation for politicians to propose.</p>
<p class="C831">6<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups educate and motivate the public to vote and become involved in political activities.</p>
<p class="C831">7<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups may put grassroots pressure on politicians by calling on their members to contact politicians and agitate for their political goals.</p>
<p class="C831">8<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups attempt to influence judicial outcomes by filing lawsuits or amicus curiae briefs.</p>
<p class="C831">9<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups <em>do not</em>:</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>run candidates for office.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>concern themselves with political issues outside of their area(s) of interest.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>INTEREST GROUPS VS. POLITICAL PARTIES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Most interest groups’ policy goals are more closely aligned with one party than another. For example, the concerns of environmental groups are reflected in the Democratic platform. Most interest groups form associations with and support members of one of the political parties. The parties support the policy goals of their interest group constituencies. For instance, the NRA is overwhelmingly supportive of the Republican Party, and the Republican Party opposes gun regulation.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups may contribute financially to both candidates in an election to ensure a favorable relationship with the winner.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups are more likely to support the incumbent than the challenger during an election. This is because the incumbency advantage makes it more likely that the current officeholder will win re-election.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Both interest groups and political parties work to promote the agenda of their membership, but there are important differences.</p>

<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>IRON TRIANGLES AND ISSUE NETWORKS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>As components of iron triangles and issue networks, interest groups work to influence members of Congress and bureaucratic agencies.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups offer support to members of Congress who serve on committees related to their policy areas. In return, members take their agendas into consideration.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups offer to promote congressional support for bureaucratic agencies and priorities. In return, bureaucratic agencies offer favorable implementation of legislative policies and friendly regulation.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Politicians and bureaucrats are frequently offered jobs working for interest groups. Additionally, interest group employees may take jobs within the government bureaucracy regulating the group’s area of concern. The movement of personnel between government and lobbying positions is described as the revolving door.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>INTEREST GROUP FUNDING AND MEMBERSHIP</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The power of interest groups is determined by funding and membership, with the best-funded groups having the most power.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Some groups are very well-funded and may offer politicians donations to their campaigns or various forms of indirect contributions.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Some groups offer less financial support, but have large memberships. These groups offer the support of their members in the form of voting and campaign assistance. For example, AARP, an interest group representing older Americans claims a membership of nearly 40 million.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566"><span id="page_211"/>c.</span>Causes that lack financial resources and large or influential membership groups will not be as effective in advocating their policies, even though they might be worthy and important.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>While campaign contributions may succeed in securing access to politicians, they do not necessarily translate into policy support from those politicians.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>The free rider problem is a funding challenge faced by interest groups whose work often benefits many people outside the group who are not members and are not motivated to contribute money or effort. A classic example of the free rider problem is union membership. If (as in some states) workers in a particular industry or workplace are not required to pay union dues, many will not but will still benefit from the union’s negotiating power.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups encourage support and membership through three primary methods.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Purposive incentives are the rewards of ethical or moral behavior. People feel satisfaction when contributing to a greater social good.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Solidarity incentives offer social rewards. Joining an interest group may allow people to spend time with other like-minded citizens.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Material incentives are tangible benefits, such as discounts offered to members, magazine subscriptions, and tote bags.</p>
<p class="C2409"><span class="C617"><strong>IV.</strong></span></p>
<p class="C2431"><strong>SOCIAL MOVEMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN HISTORY</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Social movements are broad-based coalitions of groups and individuals advocating for social change.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Social movements have a moral component, and their goals involve challenging and changing norms and values.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Social movements advocate for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>social change and group rights, such as the Civil Rights, Women’s Rights, and LGBTQ Rights movements</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>current issues, such as environmental protection or consumer rights</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_212"/>2<span class="C566">.</span>Social movements often include numerous interest groups advocating for policy in the same field. For example, the Civil Rights Movement was supported by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Urban League, and other interest groups.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Recently, several social movements have arisen in the United States.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Black Lives Matter formed in 2013. The movement’s goals include organizing protests, promoting black leadership, and opposing state-sanctioned and vigilante violence against black communities.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>The #MeToo movement developed when the #MeToo hashtag trended virally on social media when victims of sexual harassment and assault began to share their stories in order to call attention to the prevalence of these problems.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>March for Our Lives is a social movement that began as a student demonstration for increased government action to reduce gun violence in schools. It has expanded to become a larger movement focused on specific goals, including increasing youth voting.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>DISTINCTION BETWEEN INTEREST GROUPS AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups generally concern themselves with specific issues, while social movements champion broader causes.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Multiple interest groups may agitate for change as part of a broader social movement.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Interest groups are generally smaller, better organized, and more cohesive. They have clear memberships and funding mechanisms. They rely primarily on lobbying to achieve their goals.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Social movements are generally more dispersed and lack an administrative structure and clear membership. They generally rely on protest activities and demonstrations to call attention to their causes.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>SOCIAL MOVEMENT METHODS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Social movements employ protests and public demonstrations in order to create change within a social and political system.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_213"/>2<span class="C566">.</span>Civil disobedience is the intentional breaking of laws or rules in order to call attention to injustice.</p>

<p class="C2431"><strong>CAMPAIGN FINANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>HISTORY AND LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Campaigns are expensive.</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Presidential campaign spending runs into the billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>The danger of money in politics and the need for regulation of campaign donations and expenditures has long been recognized.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>The history of campaign finance law in the United States is also the history of efforts to challenge and exploit loopholes in these regulations.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>The first comprehensive law to effectively limit and regulate campaign finance was the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), passed in 1971 and amended in 1974.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_214"/>2<span class="C566">.</span><strong>The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>placed limits on individual and political action committee (PAC) contributions.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>placed limits on campaign spending.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>required reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>established a system for public financing of presidential campaigns, which became effective in 1976. (Presidential candidates generally no longer accept public monies available for their campaigns because they can raise almost unlimited money and prefer not to be subject to the restrictions attached to public funding.)</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>created the Federal Election Commission (FEC), a bipartisan commission charged with enforcing campaign contribution and spending limits and monitoring disclosure compliance.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span>In 1976, in <em>Buckley v. Valeo</em>, the Court struck down limits on campaign spending (but not necessarily contributions), ruling that spending money to influence elections is a form of constitutionally protected free speech.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span><strong>The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), also called the McCain-Feingold Act, was passed in 2002.</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Prior to BCRA, unlimited monetary contributions to political parties were allowed, so long as these funds were spent on “party-building purposes,” such as get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drives and issue advertisements (ads that provide information about a political issue but do not advocate voting for a specific candidate). These funds, which are donations to political parties, are referred to as <em>soft money</em>.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>When BCRA was passed, it</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>prohibited national parties from soliciting or spending soft money.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>placed specific limits on contributions to candidates, parties, and PACs.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a">➤</span>prohibited issue advertisements on television or radio that used a candidate’s name, were paid for by corporations or unions, and were broadcast within thirty days of a primary election or within 60 days of a general election.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><span id="page_215"/>➤</span>required candidates and any group running political advertisements to disclose who paid for the ad. This is known as the <em>stand-by-your-ad provision</em>.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>BCRA did not regulate spending by 527 committees, which are not-for-profit groups organized under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code for the purpose of influencing elections. They do not, however, advocate for specific candidates and may not coordinate with campaigns. The 527s primarily engage in issue advertising, or provide information about specific issues to the public. The 527 groups are required to report donors and donations to the IRS.</p>

<p class="C505"><em><strong>Campaign finance regulation is technical and involves its own vocabulary. Remembering a few key terms can help make it clear.</strong></em></p>
<p class="C1237"><span class="C566a">➤</span><strong>Hard money: <em>money donated directly to candidates</em></strong></p>
<p class="C1237"><span class="C566a">➤</span><strong>Soft money: <em>money donated to political parties for general “party-building” activities</em></strong></p>

<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CAMPAIGN FINANCE REGULATIONS TODAY</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span><strong><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em> (2010)</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Facts of the Case:</strong> Citizens United, a conservative nonprofit organization, was restrained by BCRA from promoting a film called <em>Hillary: The Movie</em>, which negatively portrayed Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Constitutional Issue(s):</strong> Does the BCRA ban on election advertising violate the First Amendment right to free speech? Does Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, have this First Amendment right?</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566"><span id="page_216"/>c.</span><strong>Holding(s):</strong> The BCRA ban on election advertising does violate the First Amendment right to free speech and is unconstitutional. Citizens United, a corporation, does have a free speech right.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Because Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation, a central question for the Court was whether corporations have a First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Court held that corporations do have this right and viewed the ban on political advertising by corporations as a prior restraint on political speech. This ban would be acceptable if the corporate spending was likely to lead to corruption. To prevent corruption, the organization may not communicate or coordinate with a candidate. Be aware that the decision is broadly written and applies to spending by unions, as well as corporations.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span><em>Citizens United</em> did not impact the limits on direct contributions to candidates and campaigns (hard money), or the ban on soft money contributions, which remain enforceable. As a practical matter, the removal of limits on outside spending makes candidates less reliant on direct donations (hard money).</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>The removal of limits on organizational spending to influence campaign outcomes has led to the growth of other types of political organizations, including:</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Super PACs.</strong> These organizations are also known as independent-expenditure-only committees because they engage only in outside spending and do not contribute to parties or candidates. Unlike traditional PACs, they are not limited in how much money they can raise and spend, but must not directly coordinate with campaigns.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>501 organizations.</strong> These nonprofit organizations, which include social welfare groups (charities), unions, and trade associations, are named for the part of the Internal Revenue Code under which they are organized, and are not subject to FEC regulation.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>501(c)4 organizations are defined by the IRS as “social welfare organizations,” or charities.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Unlike Super PACs, 501 groups are not required to disclose their donors. For this reason, the money they raise and spend is commonly referred to as <em>dark money.</em></p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong><span id="page_217"/>➤</strong></span>501 organizations frequently contribute to Super PACs, allowing Super PACs to indirectly collect large sums of money anonymously.</p>
