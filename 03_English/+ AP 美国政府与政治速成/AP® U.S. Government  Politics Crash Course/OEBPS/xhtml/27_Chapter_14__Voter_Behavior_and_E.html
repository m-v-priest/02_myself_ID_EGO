<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>AMENDMENTS AND LEGISLATION AFFECTING VOTING</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Voting requirements are set by states but are subject to constitutional requirements and federal law.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span><strong>The Constitution</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Fifteenth Amendment:</strong> prohibits states from restricting voting rights on the basis of race</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Seventeenth Amendment:</strong> requires direct election of senators by the voters of each state, replacing the method of election of senators by state legislatures</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span><strong>Nineteenth Amendment:</strong> prohibits states from restricting voting rights based on sex</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span><strong>Twenty-fourth Amendment:</strong> prohibits states from charging a poll tax to vote</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span><strong>Twenty-sixth Amendment:</strong> guarantees voting rights to persons over 18 years old</p>

<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Civil Rights Act of 1964:</strong> prohibited racial discrimination in voter qualification requirements</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Voting Rights Act of 1965:</strong> outlawed literacy testing and all forms of voter qualification that result in racial discrimination. This law also required preclearance for changing voting procedures for certain jurisdictions. <em>Preclearance</em> is the term for the legal requirement that jurisdictions with a significant history of racially discriminatory voting laws obtain approval from the Department of Justice before making changes to <span id="page_220"/>voting and election procedures. This provision was struck down in <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em> (2013).</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span><strong>National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (Motor Voter Act):</strong> required states to provide individuals with the opportunity to register to vote at the same time that they apply for a driver’s license or seek to renew a driver’s license</p>

<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FACTORS AFFECTING VOTER TURNOUT</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Voter turnout is widely studied as an important metric on the health of a democracy.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Voter turnout can be calculated in different ways, including as a percentage of:</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>the voting-age population—that is, all persons old enough to vote;</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>the voting-eligible population—that is, all persons who meet all legal qualifications for voting, not just age; or</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>registered voters.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>In the United States, numerous personal characteristics have been shown to correlate with the likelihood of an individual voting. It is important to recognize that these factors are associated with voter participation, but they do not necessarily cause it.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Socioeconomic status (SES).</strong> This is a measure of education, occupation, income, and wealth. Persons with higher socioeconomic status are more likely to vote and more likely to participate in politics generally.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Higher education level is the factor most strongly associated with voting participation. Highly educated people may be less intimidated by the voting process and more likely to feel a sense of political efficacy—the sense that their vote matters.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Education, income, and occupation are strongly correlated. For example, persons with a higher level <span id="page_221"/>of education are more likely to have higher prestige occupations and higher incomes.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Persons with greater wealth are more likely to bear the cost of belonging to interest groups, which may motivate voter participation.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Political efficacy.</strong> This is one’s belief that voting is an effective way to influence the world. Persons with a strong sense of political efficacy feel that their vote will make an impact and are therefore more likely to vote.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span><strong>Age.</strong> There is a strong correlation between age and voting participation. Older people have the highest turnout, and young people have the lowest turnout.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Older people often have escalating concerns about mortgages, children, retirement, social security, and Medicare, and therefore may perceive public policy as having a greater impact on their lives.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Younger people may not have developed strong political views or may not perceive that they have a significant personal stake in public policy outcomes.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span><strong>Gender.</strong> Men and women vote at similar rates, although in recent decades women have voted at a rate just slightly higher than men.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span><strong>Race.</strong> Historically, race correlates significantly with voter turnout.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Whites have the highest turnout rates.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>African American voter turnout rates were historically significantly lower than those of whites, but in recent decades the African American turnout rate has risen to within 2 to 3 percentage points of the white turnout rate.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Hispanic Americans’ and Asian Americans’ voting rates are significantly lower than those of whites and African Americans.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Many structural barriers affect voter turnout rates. <em>Structural</em> in this context is a term used to describe the characteristics of elections themselves.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Expansion of the franchise.</strong> Historically, voting rights in the United States have expanded as marginalized groups gain access to the ballot. Because these groups face structural and social challenges to voting and have historically voted at <span id="page_222"/>lower rates than more privileged groups, the expansion of the franchise has resulted in lower overall voting rates.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Negative campaigning.</strong> Attacking the political opposition, and even the government itself, are effective in influencing voter choices. They also discourage voting by creating negative feelings toward politics in general.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span><strong>Declining trust in government.</strong> Political corruption contributes to voter apathy.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span><strong>Registration process.</strong> Voting rates are reduced in states with more restrictive registration laws. Voting rates are increased by registration laws that allow:</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>opportunities for registration when applying for or renewing a driver’s license (now required by federal law)</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>online registration</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>registration at the polls on election day</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>automatic voter registration, in which voters are automatically registered by the state</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span><strong>Voter identification requirements</strong>. In recent years, a growing number of states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their identity at the polls.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>The type of identification acceptable (for example, college ID cards or a Medicare card) varies by state.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Stricter voter identification laws reduce voter turnout. Less restrictive requirements are associated with higher voter turnouts.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>The groups most likely to be impacted by voter identification requirements are the elderly, low-income, and less-educated populations.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span><strong>Tuesday elections.</strong> In most democracies, elections take place on weekends. In some countries, election day is a national holiday.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Tuesday elections in the United States create barriers to voting by making it more difficult for working people to go to the polls.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Expanded early voting and absentee voting options may help to mitigate the burden of in-person, weekday elections.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566"><span id="page_223"/>g.</span><strong>Felony disenfranchisement.</strong> States have different rules regarding the eligibility of convicted felons to vote. These rules affect a significant proportion of the population.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Some states reinstate the right to vote when a felon has finished serving his or her parole, or a fixed period of time thereafter.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>A small number of states have laws requiring mandatory lifetime disenfranchisement for all felons.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>A small number of states allow felons, including current prisoners, to vote.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">h.</span><strong>Federal vs. state elections</strong>. Voter turnout is higher in federal than in state-level elections, and higher in state than in local elections. In general, the more local the election, the lower the turnout rate.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">i.</span><strong>Presidential vs. midterm elections.</strong> Turnout rates are highest in presidential elections and lower in midterm elections.</p>

<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Like turnout, voter preferences correlate with certain demographic characteristics.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Religious beliefs strongly correlate with voter preferences.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Christian Protestants, the largest religious group in the United States, generally support Republicans. This is especially true of its Evangelical Christian subgroup.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Catholics, the second-largest religious group, historically favored Democrats, but now appear to split their support evenly between Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Jews, who comprise a small percentage of the electorate, have historically favored Democrats by a wide margin.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>There is a gender gap in voting preferences, with women generally preferring Democrats, and men generally preferring Republicans.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Voter preferences also diverge along racial lines.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Whites generally prefer Republicans by a small margin.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>African Americans prefer Democrats by a large margin.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Hispanic and Asian Americans also prefer Democrats by wide margins.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>The gap in voting preferences between non-college-educated voters and those with higher levels of education has increased in recent elections. Beyond college, the tendency to favor Democratic candidates increases as levels of education increase.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>Voter preferences are strongly correlated with rural or urban residence. Urban voters tend to favor Democrats, while rural voters tend to favor Republicans.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span>Some voters feel strongly attached to a political party. This is known as party identification. The extent to which voters identify with one party or the other is strongly influenced by one’s family, as well as other factors such as education and region of residence.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_225"/>2<span class="C566">.</span>Voter preferences may also be affected by factors specific to candidates and elections.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Different voters and voting groups may be attracted to a party based on a critical issue in an election, such as immigration or women’s rights.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Voter preferences are significantly affected by candidate characteristics. For this reason, parties attempt to promote candidates who are attractive, pleasant, and appealing.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>A candidate’s personal characteristics may resonate with certain groups of voters. John F. Kennedy overwhelmingly won Catholic voters, and Barack Obama overwhelmingly won African American voters.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Voters may be drawn to a candidate based on personal charisma or attractiveness.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Some states have ballots that offer voters the option of straight-ticket voting, or marking only one box that automatically casts their votes for all candidates running on a party’s ticket.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Voters with a strong sense of party identification are more likely to vote straight-ticket.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Although the percentage of split-ticket voting (in which voters choose certain candidates from one party and certain candidates from the other party) varies from election to election, it is always a significant number of voters.</p>

</div>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THEORIES OF VOTER BEHAVIOR</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Voting is the primary method by which citizens direct the activities of government.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Political scientists have suggested several theories of how citizens in democracies make voting decisions. Each of the following theories attempts to explain the process through which citizens decide which candidates to vote for in an election.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Rational-Choice Voting.</strong> Voters seek out information about candidates and issues and vote for the person they believe will advance their policy preferences.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Retrospective Voting.</strong> Voters consider the track record of each candidate and party to determine how effectively that party or candidate has governed.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span><strong>Prospective Voting.</strong> Voters evaluate promises and proposals made by candidates and predict how their own priorities will be affected.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span><strong>Party-Line Voting.</strong> Partisans (voters with a strong sense of party identification) are likely to make voting decisions based on the party affiliation of the candidates.</p>
<p class="C2409"><span class="C617"><strong>II.</strong></span></p>
<p class="C2431"><strong>ELECTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ELECTIONS GENERALLY</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Elections (along with political parties, interest groups, and the media) are an important linkage institution through which voters interact with government officials to produce public policy.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Federal elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Presidential elections are held every four years.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_227"/>4<span class="C566">.</span>Americans also regularly elect members of state governments, including governors, state legislatures, and state judges. (Judges in the federal system are appointed for life terms.)</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>Additionally, elections encompass the selection of officials at the local level, including county, city, and school board offices, among others.</p>
<p class="C831">6<span class="C566">.</span>As a result of democratic reforms at the state level, state and local elections feature several types of ballot questions not found in federal elections. These reforms reflect a trend toward placing greater political power in the hands of voters.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>An initiative is a procedure that allows voters to bypass their legislatures to propose laws or (state) constitutional amendments that may be placed on the ballot.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>A referendum is a policy question placed on a ballot by a state legislature for voters to accept or reject, thus allowing voters to make policy choices directly.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>A recall allows voters to hold an election to remove and replace an elected official before his or her term in office is finished.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Initiatives and referenda are often difficult to distinguish. Initiatives are laws proposed by citizens using petitions. These proposed laws may be placed on the ballot or submitted to the legislature, depending on state law. Referenda (plural of referendum) are placed on the ballot by the state legislature.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NOMINATING CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Most candidates for political office at the state and federal levels are nominated by political parties.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Nominees were historically selected by party leaders, but reforms have granted this power to the regular party members.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Voters now select nominees through direct primaries.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>The direct primary resulted in</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>a loss of power by the party leadership and increased influence for voters.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong><span id="page_228"/>➤</strong></span>increased responsibility on candidates for fundraising and managing campaigns.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>a focus on candidate characteristics and qualities.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Parties select a nominee from among declared candidates for each office within the party.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Each party then supports and promotes its nominees in the general election.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>Some candidates run as independents in the general election.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Keep in mind that candidates who are most popular with a party’s base of core voters are often ideologically pure or extreme. This is generally the type of candidate who will resonate with politically engaged partisans early on in the election process. In the general election, however, moderate candidates will draw more support from nonpartisan, middle-of-the-road voters. For this reason, moderates have historically been more electable. The choice of nominees for office demonstrates the tension between a more partisan candidate who will motivate the party’s voter base in a general election, versus a moderate candidate who will draw votes from the middle.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>PRIMARIES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Most states hold primary elections in which voters choose each party’s nominees for each office on the ballot.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>In an open primary, voters may choose at their polling places to vote in either the Democratic or Republican contest.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>In a closed primary, voters must be registered as Republicans or Democrats in order to receive their party’s ballot.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>In presidential primaries, held every four years, parties select their presidential and vice presidential nominees.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>The parties have systems for choosing a candidate on the national level.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>In the presidential primaries, the voters are selecting delegates who will vote for the chosen nominee at the party’s nominating convention.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong><span id="page_229"/>The term</strong></em> <strong>caucus <em>has two distinct political meanings. In the discussion below,</em> caucus <em>refers to a meeting of party members within a state to participate in the presidential nomination process.</em> Caucus <em>can also refer to voting blocks of legislators who are associated based on party membership, demographics, or ideology, such as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CAUCUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>About one-fifth of the states hold caucuses, rather than primary elections, to select delegates to the presidential nominating conventions.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Caucuses are local meetings of party members held in precincts across the state.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Voters discuss and debate the merits of their party’s candidates for the presidential nomination and vote publicly by grouping themselves according to candidate.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>The process is complicated and time-consuming and results in delegate selection by only the most committed voters in a state.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>OPEN PRIMARIES, CLOSED PRIMARIES, AND CAUCUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The differences among primaries and caucuses are significant because they involve different sets of participants and result in different candidate selection patterns.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Primary turnout runs low overall, at about half that of the general election. Caucus turnout is even lower.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>The more limited the nominating procedure, the more partisan and motivated the voters are, and the more ideologically intense the nominee is likely to be. This can be a problem in the general election when the more moderate elements of the electorate are more likely to participate.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Closed primaries and caucuses tend to produce more extreme candidates than open primaries because participation is limited to the most dedicated partisans.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_230"/>5<span class="C566">.</span>Although open primaries encourage the most participation, they also allow the opportunity for voters to use their votes to strategically impact the other party’s nomination. In other words, voters may vote as members of the party they oppose to support a candidate who would be a weak challenger in the general election.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>DELEGATES</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The selection of a state’s delegates to the presidential nominating convention is determined by the primary or convention process in the state.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>A state’s delegates may be awarded in proportion to the outcome of the election or caucus, or on a winner-take-all basis. The method depends on state and party rules.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Delegates that are awarded through primary elections or caucuses are called pledged delegates because they are committed to voting for a particular candidate.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Both parties’ systems also include delegates who are unpledged.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>The Republican process includes three unpledged delegates from each state, usually the top officials in the state party leadership.</p>
<p class="C831">6<span class="C566">.</span>The Democratic system includes hundreds of superdelegates, including members of Congress and party leaders, who are free to vote for any candidate.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>G.</strong></span><strong>FRONT-LOADING</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The practice of front-loading, or holding a primary or caucus early in the election cycle, confers political and economic advantages on a state.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>States with early candidate selection processes have a disproportionate impact on the selection of the nominee and are the focus of attention by candidates and the media.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Early primaries and caucuses bring attention, advertising dollars, and media coverage to the state. For this reason, states may engage in front-loading, which involves moving up their primary contests to be among the first.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Both major parties have implemented guidelines and sanctions to discourage front-loading by states.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>Iowa holds the first caucuses, and New Hampshire holds the first primary.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong><span id="page_231"/>H.</strong></span><strong>NATIONAL NOMINATING CONVENTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Following the primary contests, in the summer of presidential election years, each of the major political parties holds a national convention, also called a nominating convention.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Party conventions serve several functions:</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Conventions include the formal adoption of the party platform, which is a statement of the party’s positions on political issues.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Formal selection of the presidential nominee takes place at the convention as the delegates cast their votes.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>The vice-presidential nominee is selected.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Parties attempt to unify behind the platform and the nominee. This is important, as the supporters of losing candidates may be dissatisfied and must be encouraged to support the party nominee.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>Modern conventions are glamorous, staged, and televised events. They serve as advertising spectacles, promoting the party’s message and candidate to the general public.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Although the nominee is generally known long before the convention, it is possible that no single candidate wins a majority of the delegates, resulting in a brokered, or contested, convention. Multiple rounds of votes may be taken until a winner is determined.</p>
<p class="C2409"><span class="C617"><strong>III.</strong></span></p>
<p class="C2431"><strong>THE GENERAL ELECTION: CONGRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Congressional elections are held every two years.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Winners are determined using the single-member plurality system, also called the first-past-the-post system. This means that the candidate with the most votes wins the election, even if no candidate wins a majority of votes.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>In each congressional election, voters in the states select all (435) members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate seats.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>In presidential election years, the politics of the presidential election impact congressional candidates.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566"><span id="page_232"/>a.</span>Both the popularity of the presidential nominees and the level of opposition to them may impact voter turnout.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>An extremely unpopular presidential candidate of the opposite party may help a congressional candidate’s performance at the polls.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Likewise, a popular presidential candidate may boost votes for other “down-ballot” candidates from his or her party in what is called the <em>coattail effect</em>.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>Congressional elections that do not coincide with presidential elections are called midterm or off-year elections.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Voter turnout rates are normally significantly lower in midterm than in presidential elections.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Another notable phenomenon associated with midterm elections is that the president’s party tends to lose seats in Congress.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>This loss of seats occurs regardless of which party holds the White House and has been remarkably consistent since the first election of FDR. In only two elections since then has the incumbent president’s party gained seats in a midterm election.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>The reasons for seat loss appear to be structural, in part because the opposition base (set of core voters) is more likely to be motivated and energized in off-year elections.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Losing seats can weaken the president’s ability to enact his or her agenda in the second two years of the presidential term.</p>
<p class="C831">6<span class="C566">.</span>In addition to presidential and congressional races, ballots in federal election years include state and local races.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Voters who vote exclusively for one party’s candidates are said to be voting straight-ticket. A few states’ ballots still allow voters to efficiently vote straight-ticket by marking a single box, but the practice has been eliminated in most states.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Voters may vote for candidates of both parties for different offices. For example, a voter may vote for the Democratic candidate for president, the Republican candidate for the Senate, and so on. The practice of voting for candidates of both parties is called split-ticket voting.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>In most elections, about half of voters split their votes, and about half vote straight-ticket.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong><span id="page_233"/>B.</strong></span><strong>CAMPAIGNING FOR CONGRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>As party power has receded, campaigns have become more candidate-centered, creating both advantages and disadvantages for candidates.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Candidates must raise more of their own funds.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>The fundraising aspect of campaigns creates pressure for all candidates, but is more acute for members of the House, who must campaign every two years to hold their seats.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Senators, with a longer interval between elections, spend more per campaign than members of the House, but have to run for re-election only once every six years.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Candidates hire professional campaign management staff who create advertising campaigns, speak to the press, conduct polls, and develop strategy independent of party preferences.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Individual campaigns must efficiently use funds and target voters for messaging.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Candidates are more independent of political party control.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>A candidate may be running for office for the first time or re‑election. The person currently holding an office is called the incumbent. (Remember: <strong>in</strong>cumbent = <strong>in</strong> office.)</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>The incumbent holds a number of strategic advantages called <em>the incumbency advantage</em>.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Name recognition.</strong> Incumbents receive free publicity, both through the media and as a function of their role in government. Voters have heard incumbents’ names many times, while the names of challengers may be unfamiliar. Research shows that recognition of a candidate’s name, by itself, is likely to positively affect voters.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Casework.</strong> Members of Congress provide personal assistance to constituents (voters in their states or districts) with problems involving the federal government. Members have staff dedicated to providing this type of assistance, which produces a favorable impression on voters and increases voter support. Examples of casework types include:</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>assistance in applying for Social Security, veterans’ benefits, and educational benefits; or in tracking lost payments</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong><span id="page_234"/>➤</strong></span>assistance in immigration matters or passport applications</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>applying to a military academy</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span><strong>Franking privilege.</strong> The franking privilege allows lawmakers to send materials to citizens within their states or districts at taxpayer expense (no cost to Congress members). Challengers must fund their own mailings.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>This privilege is intended to facilitate legislators’ communication with constituents. Informative materials, however, generally include the incumbent’s smiling face and plenty of information about all that he or she has done for the district or state.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>The effect of the franking privilege may be somewhat reduced with the proliferation of electronic communications. It still provides a unique advantage, however, as it may be more difficult to dispose of paper found in a mailbox without glancing at the content, than it is to delete or ignore electronic messages.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span><strong>Committee assignments.</strong> All members of Congress serve on one or more committees, allowing them to develop relationships with specific, often powerful constituencies.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span><strong>Interest group support.</strong> Interest groups favor incumbents in terms of donations and support.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>These groups have often developed relationships with incumbents with whom they have worked on issues. (This may relate to committee assignments.)</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Interest groups recognize that incumbents are likely to win re-election and often direct their support toward current members to ensure access to those legislators. Supporting incumbents is perceived as a safer investment.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Note that groups often support both candidates for a single office in order to ensure that they will have access to and the goodwill of the office holder.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span><strong>Gerrymandering.</strong> Gerrymandered districts have created hundreds of safe seats for particular parties, which translates to strongly advantaged elections for individual office holders.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">g.</span><strong>Paid budgets.</strong> Incumbents have staffing, administrative, and travel budgets paid for by taxpayers. These may technically not be used for campaign purposes, but they support <span id="page_235"/>a candidate’s ability to travel and function in ways that challengers lack.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">h.</span><strong>Staff support.</strong> Party leaders, popular politicians, and party structures help incumbents campaign and win elections.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">i.</span><strong>Donor support.</strong> Those currently in office have a significant fundraising advantage because individual and institutional donors seeking access are more likely to contribute to incumbents, who are more likely to win than challengers.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Although most congressional elections involve an incumbent facing off against a challenger, candidates sometimes find themselves competing for an open seat.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>An open seat happens when the incumbent does not seek re-election. This may occur when the incumbent dies, retires, faces criminal or ethical allegations, or seeks a higher office.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>In an open election, the popularity of the outgoing incumbent may be a factor, but it is not as substantial as the incumbency advantage.</p>
<p class="C2409"><span class="C617"><strong>IV.</strong></span></p>
<p class="C2431"><strong>THE GENERAL ELECTION: THE PRESIDENCY</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CAMPAIGNING IN THE GENERAL ELECTION</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The convention is over. The delegates have cast their votes, and a presidential nominee has been selected. As the party turns toward the general election, decisions must be made and a course charted to win the general election.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>The candidate at this point must devise a strategy to address his or her change in audience. He or she must appeal to moderate voters in addition to the party base. These voters are less likely to be strongly partisan or to vote in primary elections or caucuses.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>At this point, candidates often “pivot” on issues or soften their views to appeal to moderate voters.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>The challenge for candidates during the general election is to maintain the enthusiasm of base voters while moving toward the middle in terms of policy.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>The likelihood of one of the presidential candidates being an incumbent is lower than in congressional races. This is due to the fact that presidents are limited by the Twenty-second Amendment to two four-year terms, or, in the case of having succeeded to the <span id="page_236"/>presidency (due to the death or disability of the president), a total of 10 years. (Remember: 22 is 2 terms or 10 years.)</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Presidential races are often for open seats due to term limits.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>For incumbent presidents, the election is a judgment by the public of their first-term performance.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>An early decision that must be made by the candidate is the selection of a running mate.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>A flaw in the original Constitution created an electoral balloting system that chose the president and vice president separately, so that the candidate with the most votes became president, and the candidate with the second-most votes became vice president.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>This system resulted in two problems: First, it could result in the election of a president and vice president of different parties. Second, because electors each cast two ballots, which did not specify whether the ballot was being cast for president or vice president, it could result in a tied electoral vote between the presidential and vice presidential candidates of the same party. This happened when presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson and vice presidential candidate Aaron Burr received the same number of electoral votes. (Burr then unsuccessfully lobbied the House of Representatives to elect him president.)</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>The Twelfth Amendment provides for presidential and vice presidential candidates to run together on a ticket.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>The choice of a running mate is a strategic decision made by the presidential candidate and his or her leadership team. The selection involves several important considerations, most importantly, how to add support or compensate for weaknesses of the presidential candidate.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>A running mate may be selected to draw support from a populous state with a large number of electoral votes.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>A presidential candidate from one geographic area, for example, the Northeast, may draw support from another geographic area, such as the South or West, by selecting a popular politician from that region as a running mate.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Candidates may choose running mates to broaden their appeal to minority groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics, or women.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566"><span id="page_237"/>d.</span>A running mate may also be chosen to balance the ticket ideologically, as when a more partisan candidate chooses a more moderate running mate, or with other political considerations in mind.</p>
<p class="C831">6<span class="C566">.</span>Finally, an important part of general election strategy involves how to allocate time and resources among states. In presidential politics, all states are definitely not equal.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Certain categories of states receive disproportionate amounts of time and money from presidential campaigns.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>States with early primary elections or caucuses are often frequent campaign stops for candidates because an early lead or disadvantage in delegates may impact the trajectory of the campaign.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Candidates generally focus on swing states, states in which both parties have a strong base and history of winning elections, and battleground states where polls show close races.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>All other things being equal, states with more electoral votes are likely to draw more attention from candidates.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Certain categories of states are likely to receive less attention from candidates.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Safe states are those in which one party has a lock on presidential elections. Illinois, for example, is reliably won by the Democratic candidate, while Alabama is reliably won by the Republican candidate. Because campaigning in these states will not affect the outcome of that state’s vote, safe states are generally ignored by both candidates.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>States with smaller populations and fewer electoral votes are less important in the scheme of presidential campaign strategies.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The United States chooses its presidents not by direct popular election, but according to a system known as the Electoral College. Although the system of electors is described in Article II, Section 1, the term <em>Electoral College</em> is not found in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>The Electoral College system is best understood as 51 separate contests, each with a different-sized prize.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566"><span id="page_238"/>a.</span>Each state has a total number of electoral votes equal to its number of seats in Congress (Senate seats + House seats). The number of Senate seats is always two, but the number of House seats varies by state population. (Recall that House seats are reapportioned every 10 years based on the decennial census.)</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>In 1961, ratification of the Twenty-third Amendment granted Washington, D.C., a number of electoral votes equal to that of the least populous state (currently 3, as the smallest states have only one House seat). (Remember: 23 is 3 for DC.)</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>The winner of each contest receives all of that state’s electoral votes (the winner-take-all system), except in Maine and Nebraska. Maine and Nebraska are unique because in those states, the popular vote winner within the state wins the two electoral votes associated with Senate seats, and each of the remaining electoral votes are divided according to the popular vote winner in of each of the states’ congressional districts.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Winning a state means that the winning candidate’s electors will be eligible to cast their votes for president.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Electors are dedicated party members chosen to fill this honorary roll who have pledged, or promised, to vote for their party’s nominee should that person win the popular vote within their state.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Although electors almost always vote as promised, they may occasionally vote for someone other than the candidate they have promised to vote for. Cases of faithless electors are infrequent and have never affected the outcome of a presidential election, although this is certainly possible.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>There are 538 electors in total (435 total House seats + 100 total Senate seats + 3 votes for the District of Columbia = 538).</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>A majority of 270 votes or more is required to win the presidency. (A plurality is not sufficient.)</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>If no candidate captures a majority of electoral votes, the winner of the presidential election is chosen by the House of Representatives, with each state having one vote. The vice president is chosen by the Senate following a similar procedure.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_239"/>3<span class="C566">.</span>Proponents of the Electoral College have made several arguments in its support.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>The founders disliked the idea of direct popular election, primarily because they feared the ascent of a tyrant who might win the presidency by misinforming and inflaming the passions of the common people. Hamilton wrote in “Federalist No. 68” (not a required document):</p>
<p class="C841">It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Hamilton’s quotation also reflects a confidence in elites, whom he and others felt could be better trusted than less educated, unsophisticated common people to elect the president. Common people at the time were also frequently rural dwellers with limited means of obtaining political information. It is important to keep in mind that the Electoral College has evolved from a system of largely independent electors to one in which parties choose electors who reliably vote for the party’s nominee.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>The Electoral College is often defended because it protects the interests of less populous, more rural states, which would have little political influence under a system of direct popular election. In such a system, the argument goes, politicians would concern themselves primarily with urban states to the detriment of rural areas.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>There are also numerous criticisms of the Electoral College, some of which have been highlighted by the failures of recent elections. These assessments point out that the Electoral College is undemocratic in various ways including the following:</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>The popular vote winner may not win the presidency.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>This can occur because state populations are not proportionate to their voting power in the Electoral College. The combined effect of disproportionate <span id="page_240"/>electoral voting strength and the winner-take-all system of vote allocation sometimes leads to the popular vote winner failing to win the presidency.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>The popular vote winner failed to win the presidential election five times in American history, notably in 2000 and 2016.</p>
<p class="C1354"><span class="C566a"><strong>➤</strong></span>Winning the popular vote but losing the election has occurred more often as population differences between more and less populous states have increased.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Because the votes of minority party voters in safe states have negligible impact, the Electoral College system negates the value of these votes and depresses turnout.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Finally, it has been argued that the Electoral College is a vestige of the slave system that gave disproportionate power to slave states as a way to incentivize ratification of the Constitution.</p>

<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>The argument for direct popular election of the president reflects a preference for majoritarian democracy, whereas the Electoral College system reflects the concept of elite democracy.
