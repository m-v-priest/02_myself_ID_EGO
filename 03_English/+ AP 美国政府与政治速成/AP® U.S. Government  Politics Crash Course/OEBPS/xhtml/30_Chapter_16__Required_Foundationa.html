</div>
<p class="C1767">The AP<strong>®</strong> U.S. Government and Politics exam requires you to be familiar with nine foundational documents that will be represented on both the multiple-choice and free-response questions.</p>
<p class="C2274"><strong>1<span class="C566">.</span>The Declaration of Independence Separation from Great Britain</strong></p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Describes the philosophical basis that justifies the separation of the colonies from Great Britain based on the social contract theory of John Locke.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Declaration is a kind of “breakup letter,” describing in a detailed list the colonies’ grievances against the British government.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Outlines key democratic ideals including popular sovereignty, natural rights, and the social contract.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Announces that the United States is an independent and sovereign state.</p>
<p class="C2274"><strong>2<span class="C566">.</span>The Articles of Confederation A Loose Alliance</strong></p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Created a confederate-style government that granted most of the authority of government to independent states and only limited authority to a weak national government.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Unicameral national legislature that did not have the power to tax, regulate commerce, or raise an army, leading to an ineffective national government and economic instability.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The national government lacked an executive branch to enforce laws and had no national courts to settle issues that arose between the states.</p>
<p class="C2274"><strong><span id="page_254"/>3<span class="C566">.</span>Brutus No. 1<br/>
Power Should Remain with the States: Small Republics Are Best</strong></p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Anti-Federalist essay opposing ratification of the Constitution because the proposed federal government would threaten liberty and state sovereignty.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Claims that the Necessary and Proper (Elastic) Clause creates a federal government with limitless power.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Argues that the Supremacy Clause creates a federal government with authority to cancel out any state law and reduces the importance of state government.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Constitution creates a Congress with essentially unlimited authority to tax through potentially broad interpretations of the provision for the government to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The ability of the national legislature to keep a standing army, even during times of peace, is a threat to liberty.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The large size and diverse population of the United States would make it impossible for a federal government to accurately represent the will of the people.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Democracy works best if there are only a few competing factions. The large republic proposed in the Constitution would have too many competing groups, resulting in a threat to the interests of individual citizens.</p>
<p class="C2274"><strong>4<span class="C566">.</span>Federalist No. 10<br/>
The Constitution: A Solution to the Problem of Factions</strong></p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Madison provides a counterargument to <em>Brutus No. 1</em> presenting how the Constitution will control factions.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Factions are undesirable, but inevitable, because the only way to eliminate factions is to destroy liberty or give everyone the same opinions.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>A large republic addresses the problem of factions by creating a climate in which many groups compete for influence. Under such a system, no single group would be able to dominate the others.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The principle of the popular vote would prevent any group (faction) from dominating if it held less than majority support.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a"><span id="page_255"/>➤</span>A republic (representative democracy) is superior to a democracy (direct or pure democracy) because educated and thoughtful people would be elected to make policy.</p>
<p class="C2274"><strong>5<span class="C566">.</span>Federalist No. 51<br/>
Checks and Balances: Ambition Must Counteract Ambition</strong></p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Madison argues that Montesquieu’s ideas of separation of powers and checks and balances, which are present in the federal government created by the Constitution, prevent the abuse of power by the government.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Separation of powers that is built into the government by the Constitution prevents the concentration of power in one person, group, or government institution.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Three distinct branches, each with different areas of authority and combined with the natural personal ambition of members of the government, will prevent any one branch from dominating the government.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Acknowledges that the legislative branch will be the most powerful, but argues that it is checked by the other branches (such as the executive use of the veto) and by the inter-branch check of the bicameral legislature.</p>
<p class="C2274"><strong>6<span class="C566">.</span>Federalist No. 70<br/>
Power to the President</strong></p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Hamilton’s argument for the single, powerful executive created by the Constitution (as opposed to an executive committee).</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>A single executive will be able to operate with more energy and efficiency in executing the law and responding in the case of a crisis.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>A single president will not become a tyrant because one individual will be easier to control.</p>
<p class="C2274"><strong>7<span class="C566">.</span>Federalist No. 78<br/>
An Independent Judiciary</strong></p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Hamilton’s essay about the need for a strong federal judiciary, including the theory of judicial review and the importance of life terms of justices.</p>
<p class="C2280"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The judicial branch is the least dangerous because (1) it must rely on the other branches to carry out its rulings; and (2) it lacks the power of the purse and the power of the sword held by the other branches.</p>
<p class="C2274"><strong><span id="page_256"/>8<span class="C566">.</span>The Constitution of the United States<br/>
