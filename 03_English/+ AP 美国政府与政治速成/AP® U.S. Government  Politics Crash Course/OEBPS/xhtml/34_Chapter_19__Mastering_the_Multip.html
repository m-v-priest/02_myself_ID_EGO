<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>TIMING AND SCORING</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Your score for the multiple-choice section of the exam is based on the total number of questions you answer correctly. Points are not deducted for incorrect answers, so it is important that you answer every question, even if you have to guess.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>There are 55 multiple-choice questions with four possible answer choices (A–D). This section of the exam lasts 1 hour and 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>TOP 10 TEST TIPS FOR MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The most important tip for answering multiple-choice questions is to carefully read the question and be sure you understand what the question is asking. In other words, RTFQ (Read the Full Question).</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>When reading the question, feel free to underline, draw boxes around words, or make notes. Do whatever helps you understand the question correctly and remember helpful information.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Cross out answers that you feel confident are incorrect.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Keep in mind that you will be expected to choose the <em>most correct</em> option from among answer choices that may include a few reasonable options. Ask yourself which choice fully answers the question. If it’s only partially true or true in limited circumstances, it is likely <em>not</em> correct.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>The multiple-choice questions vary in their level of difficulty. Some will be easy, while others will be more difficult. Answer the easy ones and move on; don’t waste time. Reason through the difficult questions using the strategies you know.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_276"/>6<span class="C566">.</span>Occasionally, you may see something unfamiliar that was not covered in class. Eliminate unlikely answers and make an educated guess. Ask yourself what seems logical. No worries—you will <em>not</em> be getting 100% on the multiple-choice section. The test is designed to make this extremely unlikely.</p>
<p class="C831">7<span class="C566">.</span>Test questions may use different or slightly altered terms for concepts you are familiar with. For example, <em>gubernatorial</em> refers to something relating to the governor. Other terms for <em>supply-side economics</em> are <em>Reaganomics</em> and <em>trickle-down economics.</em> If a question seems to be asking about a familiar concept, it may just be using an unfamiliar term.</p>
<p class="C831">8<span class="C566">.</span>Make a notation next to questions you find difficult. You can come back to them if you have time.</p>
<p class="C831">9<span class="C566">.</span>Save time on text-based questions by looking over the questions before you read the passage. Then annotate or underline the excerpt, focusing only on the information being tested.</p>
<p class="C2475">10<span class="C566">.</span>Familiarize yourself with the six question types (see below), and complete as many practice questions as you can. Test-taking is really a skill! Use your results to help you focus your study time on your areas of weakness.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>TYPES OF MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C2154">There are six types of multiple-choice questions. Each type is explained in detail below and followed with examples. Remember that some questions will take more time to answer than others, especially those involving reading a passage or analyzing a data set. Spend time carefully reviewing the sample multiple-choice questions in <a href="35_Chapter_20__Practice_Multiple_Ch.html#page_279">Chapter 20</a>.</p>
<p class="C2326"><span class="C566"><strong>I.</strong></span><strong>Knowledge-Based Questions.</strong> This type of multiple-choice question is probably the most familiar to you, but one you will see the <em>least</em> frequently on the test. This type of question tests your understanding of political principles, processes, policies, and behaviors. Most of the exam requires a different skill: using your knowledge of the material in the context of how political science principles apply in real-world situations.</p>
<p class="C2488"><span class="C566"><strong>II.</strong></span><strong>Comparison-Based Questions.</strong> These questions require the skill of comparing and contrasting—or identifying similarities and differences—between political science concepts. They involve a specific style of chart and can be tricky. Remember that an answer must be correct as it relates to <em>both</em> sides of the chart. It is extremely helpful for you to cross off answers if you know that one side is incorrect.</p>
<p class="C2491"><span class="C566"><strong><span id="page_277"/>III.</strong></span><strong>Quantitative Analysis.</strong> When presented with quantitative data in graphs, tables, charts, or infographics, you will be expected to draw conclusions and make connections to course content. The first question will often require you to identify a trend, outcome, pattern, or limitation in the data. Subsequent questions will test your ability to make an inference or conclusion about the data based on your existing knowledge. You may be asked to identify the causes or consequences of a trend or the reason for a relationship within the data.</p>
<p class="C2491"><span class="C566"><strong>IV.</strong></span><strong>Text-Based Analysis.</strong> This type of multiple-choice question requires analysis and application of both primary and secondary sources. Primary sources include, but are not limited to, the nine required foundational documents of the course (see <a href="30_Chapter_16__Required_Foundationa.html#page_253">Chapter 16</a>) and opinions from the 15 required Supreme Court cases (see <a href="31_Chapter_17__Required_Supreme_Cou.html#page_259">Chapter 17</a>). Primary source documents in this type of multiple-choice question might also include non-required foundational documents, non-required Supreme Court opinions, speeches, or legislation. These questions might also involve a secondary source, such as writings from political scientists, economists, or historians.</p>
<p class="C2488"><span class="C566"><strong>V.</strong></span><strong>Visual Analysis.</strong> This multiple-choice section will require you to analyze images presented in the form of maps, flowcharts, infographics, and political cartoons that may or may not contain data for related political science concepts. For example, you may be asked to interpret congressional maps or organizational charts.</p>
<p class="C2491"><span class="C566"><strong>VI.</strong></span><strong>Concept Application</strong>. You will encounter multiple-choice questions that require you to analyze specific situations and explain how they demonstrate various political science concepts or theories.</p>
