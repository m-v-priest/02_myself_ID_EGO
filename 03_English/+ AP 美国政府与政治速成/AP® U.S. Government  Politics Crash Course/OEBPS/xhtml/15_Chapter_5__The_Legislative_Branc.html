<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>C.</strong></span>Inherent powers are those held by Congress that are neither enumerated nor implied. This category can be defined as those powers that obviously and automatically belong to the government of every sovereign state. They are understood to inherently (by nature) belong to every nation’s government. Examples include the powers to:</p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>control national borders</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>acquire new territory</p>

<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>D.</strong></span>The Constitution, in Article I Section 9, specifically prohibits the national government taking certain actions that are referred to as denied powers. For example, Congress is denied the authority to:</p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>tax exports</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>pass ex post facto laws or bills of attainder or violate the Bill of Rights</p>

<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>grant titles of nobility</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>E.</strong></span>Article I, Section 9, also contains the Emoluments Clause, which states that federal officials may not “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State,” without the approval of Congress.</p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>An emolument is a payment or any thing of value.</p>

<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Rather than hold elections for all 100 Senate seats every 6 years, the Framers designed a staggered election scheme in which one-third of Senate seats are up for election every 2 years.

<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Unlike the Senate, the House is not designed as a continuous body; all 435 seats are up for election every 2 years. Since most members are reelected, massive membership changes do not generally occur.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Representatives (also sometimes called Congress members) are elected from single-member districts within states. They represent the residents of their districts.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>The Constitution directs that each state shall receive in the House a number of seats proportional to its share of the population. Beyond this, states have the reserved power to determine the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives.”</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>The number of House seats allocated to each state is recalculated every 10 years, based on the census count. The census is a national survey designed to quantify and collect data on the United States population.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Following each census, the number of House seats allocated to each state is reapportioned, or redistributed, based on the percentage of the population living in each state. States may gain or lose seats.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_68"/>4<span class="C566">.</span>Each state legislature then divides the state into congressional districts, a number of geographical areas with roughly equal populations, corresponding to the number of House seats held by the state. For the least populated states, with only one House seat, the district is the entire state.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>State legislatures have broad discretion in how district boundaries are constructed. Districts must be roughly equal in population and drawn based on racial considerations that are subject to strict scrutiny.</p>
<p class="C831">6<span class="C566">.</span>Because state legislatures draw district maps, a party holding a majority in a given state legislature may draw the map to its advantage. That is, a majority party in a state legislature may manipulate district boundaries to elect to Congress a disproportionate number of members of that party. This practice is called gerrymandering.</p>
<p class="C831">7<span class="C566">.</span>Gerrymandering is based on two basic principles: packing and cracking. Packing is the process of creating districts that include a large proportion of opposition voters, limiting their voting power by concentrating them in one or a small number of districts. Cracking is the process of spreading opposition voters among many districts, preventing them from having a majority in any of them.</p>
<p class="C831">8<span class="C566">.</span>Some states use independent commissions to conduct the process of redistricting and avoid partisan gerrymandering.</p>

<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Be sure you know and understand the difference between reapportionment, redistricting, and gerrymandering.</strong></em> <strong>Reapportionment <em>is the redistribution of the 435 House seats among the 50 states following the census.</em> Redistricting <em>is the drawing of new district boundaries within states.</em> Gerrymandering <em>is redistricting in such a way as to create an advantage for a party or other group.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE SUPREME COURT AND GERRYMANDERING</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span><strong><em>Baker v. Carr</em> (1962)</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Facts of the Case:</strong> The district boundaries for the state legislature in Tennessee in the 1950s were based on outdated census data that did not reflect population shifts. As a result, there were substantial differences in the population <span id="page_69"/>sizes of each district, with rural districts having significantly smaller populations than urban districts. The Tennessee state constitution required redrawing districts every 10 years based on population shifts, but that requirement had not been followed. This resulted in malapportionment, or the creation of voting districts with significantly unequal populations. Because the votes of residents of different districts were of unequal weight in selecting political representation, Charles Baker, a resident of an urban district, argued that he and other voters in his district were being denied “equal protection” guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Constitutional Issue(s):</strong> Does a Fourteenth Amendment equal protection challenge to a legislative districting plan represent a political question, which cannot be decided by the Court?</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span><strong>Holding:</strong> A Fourteenth Amendment equal protection challenge to the constitutionality of a districting plan does not present a political question. The federal district court may hear the case.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span><strong>Reasoning:</strong> A political question is one that may not be decided by the courts for a variety of reasons. For example, the Constitution may grant final authority on a matter to another branch of government, or the courts may not be able to offer an appropriate remedy (solution). Although the Court had previously declined to decide the merits of cases related to redistricting, here the Court held that the issue of malapportionment did not present a political question. Because the case had been dismissed by the District Court without a trial, the Supreme Court did not consider whether the Tennessee districting scheme actually violated the plaintiffs’ rights in this case. Importantly, <em>Baker v. Carr</em> established the precedent that districting plans could be challenged as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, leading to the “one person, one vote” principle later articulated in <em>Reynolds v. Sims</em> (1964), which stated that electoral districts in state legislatures must be equal in population. The equal population precedent would later be applied to congressional districts in <em>Wesberry v. Sanders</em> (1964).</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span><strong><em>Shaw v. Reno</em> (1993)</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span><strong>Facts of the Case:</strong> Following the 1990 census, North Carolina gained one seat in the House of Representatives, and a new congressional district map was drawn consisting of 12 districts. Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, states, counties, and <span id="page_70"/>municipalities with a history of racial discrimination in voting rules were required to obtain the approval of the United States Attorney General before implementing new voting rules, including new congressional districts. (This provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is no longer in effect.) In this case, North Carolina attempted to create two majority-minority districts, or districts in which a racial minority (African Americans) would compose a majority of the district. One of these districts was 160 miles long, primarily following a highway. The district bisected several existing communities and was, in some places, only as wide as the highway it followed. Five white voters sued, claiming that the district was drawn based on racial motivation in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span><strong>Constitutional Issue(s):</strong> Does a plan of congressional redistricting drawn with the purpose of favoring a racial minority group violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span><strong>Holding:</strong> Congressional districts drawn solely on the basis of race violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Although racial considerations may be a legitimate concern in many state-level decisions, efforts to segregate the voting public based on race alone may be divisive and have unintended negative consequences. The drawing of district boundaries based solely on race is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The test for determining whether a district is based on race alone is whether its design can be reasonably understood as being based on other factors.</p>
<div class="C1980">
<p class="C505"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> In <em>Rucho v. Common Cause</em> (2019), SCOTUS ruled that <em>partisan</em> gerrymandering claims (those involving districts drawn purely to advantage a political party) are political questions and may not be decided by federal courts. Federal courts may address districting cases involving population disparities (<em>Baker</em>) and racial gerrymandering claims (<em>Shaw</em>) because these violate Equal Protection guarantees. Partisan gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable because a judicially manageable standard for resolving such claims does not exist. Furthermore, the Constitution assigns responsibility for districting decisions to state legislatures and Congress.</p>

<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Before each new Congress convenes, the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference (membership of each party in each house) meet to select leaders and committee chairs. Leadership positions in Congress are then determined by strict party votes. The majority party holds all of the key leadership positions, including committee chairs, and the majority party has the most members on every committee. The leadership teams of each party work to advance the party’s platform and coordinate deal-making efforts when issues result in a division within the party or within the House or Senate.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Leadership of the House of Representatives</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>The presiding officer is the Speaker of the House, who controls the calendar, sets the agenda, and assigns bills to committees. The Speaker is second in the order of presidential succession according to the Twenty-fifth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>The majority floor leader manages the legislative process and coordinates the party strategy to get bills important to the party caucus passed.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>The majority whip assists the party by building coalitions, counting potential votes, and influencing members to vote with party leadership. No vote is held before the whip informs party leadership of the likely outcome.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Committee chairs are the powerful leaders of the standing committees who have the power to kill a bill by not reporting it to the full House.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>The minority party leadership consists of a minority party floor leader and a minority whip that coordinate the legislative strategy of the party out of power.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Leadership of the Senate</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>The presiding officer of the Senate, according to the Constitution, is the president of the Senate, who is also the U.S. vice president. The position of president of the Senate is largely ceremonial. The U.S. vice president appears in the Senate on opening day and for the State of the Union Address, and casts a vote only in the instance of a tie.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>The president pro tempore (“for the time”) presides over the Senate in the absence of the vice president (almost always) and is third in the order of presidential succession, after the vice president and the Speaker of the House. This largely <span id="page_75"/>symbolic role is typically given to the longest-serving member of the majority party.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>The most powerful position in the Senate is the majority party leader, who schedules legislation and coordinates the majority party strategy along with the majority whip.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Committee chairs are the leaders of the standing committees who have the power to kill a bill by not reporting it to the full Senate.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>The Senate minority party leadership consists of a minority party floor leader and a minority whip that coordinate the legislative strategy of the party out of power.</p>
<p class="C2409"><span class="C617"><strong>IV.</strong></span></p>
<p class="C2431"><strong>THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS: HOW A BILL BECOMES A LAW</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span>Bills may only be introduced by members of Congress. (The president may not introduce legislation; he or she may only request that Congress do so.) Both houses follow similar procedures in processing legislation. Each house, however, has its own unique rules and procedures, so the path that legislation follows from introduction to passage can vary widely.</p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Bills may be introduced in either house, although revenue bills, those that propose to generate government income through the imposition of taxes or fees, must constitutionally be introduced first in the House.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Members of the House introduce bills by putting them into the <em>hopper</em>, a box on the floor of the House. In the Senate, bills are introduced by submission to clerks on the Senate floor.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>A bill must be passed by each house of Congress in identical form before it may be submitted to the president to be signed into law.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Incumbent members of both houses derive an advantage in campaigning for re-election as a result of their ability to direct federal funds to their states and districts. The practice of generating legislation that produces income for their districts is known as <em>pork barrel spending</em>, as it is often excessive and unnecessary, but proves a member’s ability to “bring home the bacon.”</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>The term <em>logrolling</em> refers to trading votes, or “you vote for my bill and I will vote for yours.” This practice is a feature of both chambers.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong><span id="page_76"/>B.</strong></span>In both houses, bills are next assigned to the standing committee with the appropriate jurisdiction and subject matter expertise to evaluate and work on the bill. Occasionally, most often in the House, multiple committees may work on parts of bills.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>Committee Consideration</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Committee chairs set each committee’s agenda. That is, they decide which bills the committee will attempt to pass through Congress during the session. Committees are always chaired by a member of the majority party in the chamber.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>For practical and political reasons, most bills are not reported by the committee. Bills that are not placed on a committee’s agenda (or pigeonholed) normally die in committee. In the House, a bill can be removed from committee and brought directly to the floor using an instrument called a discharge petition, which requires majority support of the full membership. The process is rarely successful, however, as it requires disloyalty to the party agenda on the part of at least some majority party members.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Committee action generally begins with a hearing, during which policy experts and interested parties may give testimony about the subject under consideration. Hearings inform members of Congress, the press, and the public about proposed legislation and its impact. Committee members, of course, also seek input on legislation from other sources.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Subcommittees—smaller, more specialized subgroups within committees-—may play roles in revising proposed bills.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>A <em>markup</em> follows. This is a meeting in which the committee discusses the proposed legislation, makes changes, and produces a final draft for floor consideration. The bill that comes out of the committee may be essentially the same as the original bill, or it may be substantially rewritten in committee.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>D.</strong></span>Following committee consideration, bills are placed on calendars for floor debate. This is done through different mechanisms in each house, but in both cases, the process is directed by the majority party.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>E.</strong></span>Procedures for debating and passing bills on the floor of each chamber are similar. In both houses, a quorum, or a majority of the membership, must be present in order to conduct business. Each <span id="page_77"/>chamber, however, has its own set of procedural rules. Following are the most significant differences in debate between the two houses of Congress.</p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span><strong>House Procedures</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Procedures in the House, because of its membership size (435), are more formal and debate more limited than in the Senate.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Most bills are considered under the suspension of the rules procedure, which limits debate to 40 minutes, does not allow members to propose amendments to bills, and requires two-thirds approval for passage of legislation.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Other bills are debated under a special rule created by the House Rules Committee, sometimes called the traffic cop committee of the House.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Each special rule sets forth specific limitations on debate for the bill in question, including time limits and restrictions on offering amendments.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>After a special rule is adopted, the House generally considers the bill as the Committee of the Whole. That is, the entire House becomes a committee, allowing for consideration of amendments under a more relaxed and efficient set of rules. (This procedure also allows for work to take place without a quorum present.) The Committee of the Whole then reports to the full House of Representatives (itself) where amendments may be adopted and the bill voted on.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span>In the House, some votes may be taken by voice (members vote “aye” or “nay” in response to the question, and the Speaker announces the winner of the vote), but most votes are taken via an electronic voting system, which records each member’s vote.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Senate Procedures</strong></p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Procedures in the Senate are characterized by less formality than those of the House. In fact, there is no formal limit on debate in the Senate, which proudly considers itself to be the most democratic body in the world.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>In terms of legislative procedure, the Senate must first agree to bring a bill to the floor, usually through unanimous consent.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566"><span id="page_78"/>c.</span>Because Senate rules do not allow for a simple majority to terminate debate, senators may engage in a filibuster. The filibuster is a tactic by which one or more senators may threaten to extend debate on an issue to prevent a vote. A senator signals the intent to filibuster by placing a hold—a request to delay floor debate—on a bill.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">d.</span>Originally, a filibuster would bring a halt to Senate business through sustained debate. Starting in 1970, however, Senate rules were changed to create a two-track system, under which the chamber could consider other business while filibustered bills are pending.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">e.</span>A filibuster may be ended using cloture, a procedure under which debate may be terminated by a 60-vote supermajority. The practical effect of these procedures, particularly in a partisan environment, is that bills frequently require sixty votes for passage in the Senate.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">f.</span>Votes may be taken by voice, standing, or by roll call, in which each senator’s vote is on the record.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>You may encounter a question that requires you to identify constitutional powers unique to each house. Be aware that most House and Senate procedures and rules, e. g., filibuster, cloture, Committee of the Whole procedures, Rules Committee procedures, discharge petitions, and others, are not discussed in the Constitution. How the houses of Congress conduct business is only broadly described in the Constitution. For unique constitutional powers of each house, see the “Unique Constitutional Powers and Duties of the House and the Senate” chart earlier in this chapter.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>F.</strong></span>Before a bill can become law, it must be passed in identical form in both houses. Most often, however, House and Senate versions of a bill have differences, which must then be reconciled. This is done in a conference committee, a committee made up of members of both houses who work out a compromise bill that can be passed in identical form in both houses.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>G.</strong></span>Once a bill has been passed in identical form in both houses, it goes to the president for a signature. There are four possible scenarios at this point.</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_79"/>1<span class="C566">.</span>If the president signs the bill, it becomes law.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>The president may veto the bill, or refuse to sign the bill and return it to Congress with an explanation of his or her objections. A veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of both houses. In the event of an override, the bill becomes law without the president’s signature. Otherwise, the bill dies.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>The president may refuse to sign or veto the bill, in which case it will become law in 10 days without his or her signature.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>If Congress adjourns within the 10-day period, however, the bill dies. This is called a pocket veto.</p>

<p class="C2431"><strong>THE FEDERAL BUDGET</strong></p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>BUDGET PROCESS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Working with the executive branch, Congress must generate a budget each year to fund all of the activities, programs, and services carried out by the federal government. The budget includes three broad categories of spending.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">a.</span>Discretionary spending, or federal agency spending, is funding for various agencies and programs, which the government is not obligated to fund to a certain level. Congress has discretion, or the ability to decide how much federal money <span id="page_81"/>should be spent. Discretionary spending accounts for about one-third of federal spending.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">b.</span>Interest on the national debt, which Congress must pay and cannot change, generally makes up less than 10 percent of the budget.</p>
<p class="C1253"><span class="C566">c.</span>Mandatory spending is spending required by law. It includes Social Security, Medicare, veterans’ benefits, and other entitlements, or benefits to which certain people are guaranteed by law, and makes up over half of all funding.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB): The OMB, part of the executive branch, begins the budget process by reviewing all of the monetary requests from each of the federal agencies and combining them into the president’s proposed budget. The OMB estimates, based on taxes and spending, whether the government will have a surplus or budget deficit and sends the proposed budget to Congress. Although Congress has the power to reduce entitlements, this is extremely politically difficult and rarely done.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span>Congressional Budget Office (CBO): The CBO, which was created by Congress, analyzes the president’s proposed budget and provides economic data to Congress.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>Congressional Review: Standing budget committees in each chamber make changes and create budget resolutions. Budget resolutions are passed by each house.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>House and Senate versions of the budget go to conference committee for reconciliation (compromise).</p>
<p class="C831">6<span class="C566">.</span>The budget resolution is not a law. It provides guidelines or goals for spending. Spending bills, also called appropriations bills, are passed to fulfill the budget targets.</p>
<p class="C831">7<span class="C566">.</span>Appropriations bills are then sent to the president for approval.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FACTORS INFLUENCING THE BUDGET</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>All money the government spends must come from either revenue (government income, mostly produced by taxes) or borrowing (the government takes on debt).</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Each annual budget passed by Congress produces either a surplus (the government spends less than it is generating in revenue) or a deficit (the government spends more than it is generating in revenue).</p>
<p class="C831"><span id="page_82"/>3<span class="C566">.</span>A defining feature of the modern budget process is the tension between mandatory spending, which increases over time, and discretionary spending.</p>
<p class="C831">4<span class="C566">.</span>As entitlement costs increase, discretionary spending must decrease unless taxes are raised, or the government is willing to take on more debt.</p>
<p class="C831">5<span class="C566">.</span>Reducing discretionary spending is unpopular because discretionary spending pays for many important programs that benefit citizens and businesses.</p>
<p class="C831">6<span class="C566">.</span>Taking on debt is politically difficult because both debt and interest must be paid in the future and this may hamper economic growth.</p>
<p class="C831">7<span class="C566">.</span>Raising taxes is unpopular.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Students are sometimes confused by the relationship between “deficit” and “debt.” A budget deficit is the amount by which the government’s expenditures exceed its revenues in a given year. The national debt is the total amount the government owes. Each year of deficit spending contributes to the national debt.</strong></em></p>

<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS (PARTISANSHIP)</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Members of Congress usually try to support their political party’s goals if possible, and partisanship in Congress has been increasing.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Congress is organized by political party. The majority party leaders dominate the workings of Congress and ensure most benefits come to majority party members.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>DIVIDED GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>When the majority party in Congress is different from the party of the president, it is often difficult to pass legislation, resulting in gridlock.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>The president may convince members of Congress to compromise on legislation because it is unlikely that Congress would have the two-thirds supermajority needed to override a veto.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong><span id="page_83"/>C.</strong></span><strong>COALITIONS IN CONGRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span>Coalitions are formed when groups and individuals within Congress join together to advance a set of policy goals that they could not successfully promote alone. Coalitions may be based on ideology, economics, geography, or other factors. Winning alliances are able to place issues on the legislative agenda and guide their policies through Congress.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span>Coalitions tend to form more readily in the Senate than in the House. This is due in part to term lengths. House members count on being re-elected every two years and may be more hesitant to displease their constituencies, which may be more partisan. Senators, on the other hand, serve for six years, and they serve entire states, which may encompass greater diversity of opinion.</p>
<p class="C1097"><span class="C566"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>VIEWS OF THE PROPER ROLE OF A REPRESENTATIVE</strong></p>
<p class="C831">1<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Delegate:</strong> A member of the House or Senate votes based on the preferences of the majority of his or her constituents. This view reflects participatory democracy.</p>
<p class="C831">2<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Trustee:</strong> A member of the House or Senate votes based on his or her conscience in the best interest of society, even if this results in choices that do not please a majority of his or her constituency. Members of Congress may have more access to information about issues from hearings and debate and may be better informed than their constituents. This view reflects elite democracy.</p>
<p class="C831">3<span class="C566">.</span><strong>Politico:</strong> This model is a hybrid of the trustee and delegate models of representation. A member of the House or Senate follows the preferences of his or her constituents (delegate model) or his or her conscience and informed decision (trustee model), depending on the issue and the degree of public concern about a particular policy decision.</p>

<p class="C505"><em><strong>Members of Congress may not always be acting on some combination of the delegate and trustee models. You may encounter questions relating to the motivations of legislators in various situations. Be aware that lawmakers are also influenced by the goals of their political party (partisanship) and the effect of interest groups. However, be cautious of answers that appear cynical (distrustful of the integrity or sincerity of a person or thing). For example, legislators are not “bribed” by interest groups; interest group campaign donations help them to gain “access” to lawmakers.</strong></em></p>
