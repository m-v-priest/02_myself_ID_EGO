<p class="C559"><strong>Required Supreme Court Cases</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="C1842">This course requires you to thoroughly understand 15 Supreme Court cases. Each case represents an important principle of law.</p>
<p class="C2409"><span class="C617"><strong>I.</strong></span></p>
<p class="C2431"><strong>THE COURT</strong></p>
<p class="C831"><strong>1<span class="C566">.</span></strong>Supreme Court cases make law. The law established by Court rulings (precedent) must be followed in subsequent cases that present the same legal question. This is the principle of <em>stare decisis</em>. Precedent must be followed in subsequent cases unless there is a compelling reason to break with previous case law.</p>
<p class="C831"><strong>2<span class="C566">.</span></strong>Additionally, remember the following important terms relating to court cases.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Judicial review</em> is the power of the courts to determine if any law or action of government is inconsistent with the Constitution and, if so, to invalidate that law or action.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Writ of certiorari</em> is an order from an appellate court requiring that a lower court provide the record of a case for review. When the Supreme Court “grants cert,” it agrees to take an appeal.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Civil liberties</em> are personal rights and freedoms held by individuals with which the government may not interfere.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Civil rights</em> are those rights that the government must enforce, to be free from discrimination or unequal treatment based on membership in a minority group or class under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Selective incorporation</em> is the piecemeal application of the civil liberties in the Bill of Rights to the states based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Majority opinion</em> is the written document containing the decision or ruling of the Court.</p>
<p class="C831"><strong><span id="page_260"/>3<span class="C566">.</span></strong>Each case may be understood in terms of four elements:</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>facts of the case (What happened?)</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>constitutional issue presented (What is the legal question that must be answered?)</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>holding (How did the Court answer the legal question?)</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>reasoning (What logic and law did the Court follow in drawing its conclusion?)</p>

<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>The AP® U.S. Government and Politics exam requires students to analyze a real-world scenario based on a Supreme Court decision, or compare a non-required case to one of the required cases.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<div class="C2486">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Each of the required cases is explained at length in the relevant chapter of this book, which is indicated next to the case name in the list below.</p>
</div>
<p class="C1768"><strong>1<span class="C566">.</span>Judicial Review</strong></p>
<p class="C2154">An early question that had to be answered was whether the Court had the power to apply the Constitution to invalidate the actions of the other branches of government.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Marbury v. Madison</em> (1803)</strong> (see <a href="18_Chapter_8__The_Judicial_Branch.html#page_115">chapter 8</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>The Supreme Court claims the power of judicial review.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>In <em>Marbury,</em> the Supreme Court established its power of judicial review (the power to nullify acts of the legislative or executive branches or state governments as unconstitutional), which greatly strengthened the federal judicial branch.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Constitution does not explicitly grant the courts the power of judicial review, but Alexander Hamilton’s essay “Federalist No. 78” indicates that this was the Framers’ intention.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>In <em>Marbury</em>, Chief Justice John Marshall famously struck down a federal statute for the first time—the Judiciary Act of 1789—that had given the Court the power to hear a case under original jurisdiction (which means to hear a case for the first time).</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a"><span id="page_261"/>➤</span>The Court held that the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional because Congress could not give the Court original jurisdiction beyond that granted by the Constitution.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Because Chief Justice John Marshall effectively sided with Jefferson, the new president, the executive branch did not challenge the Court’s proclamation that it held the power of judicial review.</p>
<div class="C1495">
<p class="C1768"><strong>2<span class="C566">.</span>Federalism</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="C2154">The division of powers created by the Constitution has led to an ongoing tension between the states and the federal government.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em> (1819)</strong> (see <a href="13_Chapter_4__Federalism.html#page_47">chapter 4</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>The Necessary and Proper Clause is elastic, and the Federal Government is supreme.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The state of Maryland imposed a tax on a branch of the Second Bank of the United States that operated in that state.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Supreme Court held that, although the Constitution does not specifically grant Congress the power to establish a bank, that power is implied by the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article 1<span class="C566">.</span>In other words, <em>Congress has implied powers</em>.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Under the Supremacy Clause, federal laws are more powerful than state laws. Federal law and the U.S. Constitution are supreme over state law<em>.</em></p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>United States v. Lopez</em> (1995)</strong> (see <a href="13_Chapter_4__Federalism.html#page_47">chapter 4</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>The Court limits the power of Congress.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Before <em>Lopez</em>, the Court had greatly expanded Congress’s implied powers based on the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>In <em>Lopez</em>, a student was charged with carrying a gun into a school in violation of federal law.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Court held that Congress may not use the commerce power to criminalize carrying a gun in a school, because the federal government could not show that there was any connection between this behavior and interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Lopez</em> reversed a long trend of Supreme Court rulings expansively interpreting the Commerce Clause to enhance federal power.</p>
<p class="C831"><strong>3<span class="C566">.</span>Civil Liberties</strong></p>
<p class="C2154">Civil liberties are personal freedoms with which the government may not interfere (except in limited circumstances).</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a"><span id="page_262"/>➤</span>In the Bill of Rights, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibited the federal government from infringing on individual liberties. The states were not restrained by the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1868, has been held by the Supreme Court to make most of the Bill of Rights applicable to state governments.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Court did not find all civil liberties to be protected from state action at once, but piecemeal, or one at a time. The Supreme Court’s pattern of applying civil liberties protections against state governments one-by-one is called <em>selective incorporation</em>.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Most, but not all, of the civil liberties protected in the Bill of Rights, have been applied to the states.</p>
<div class="C2303">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The required civil liberties cases follow. Some, but not all, are cases that incorporated a right against the states for the first time.</p>
</div>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Engel v. Vitale</em> (1962)</strong> (see <a href="20_Chapter_9__Civil_Liberties.html#page_133">chapter 9</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>School prayer in public schools violates the Establishment Clause.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits government sponsorship of or affiliation with religion.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Public schools may not sponsor prayers, even if the prayer is nondenominational and non-compulsory.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Engel</em> is understood as prohibiting any school-sponsored/ sanctioned religious activity in public schools.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972)</em></strong> (see <a href="20_Chapter_9__Civil_Liberties.html#page_133">chapter 9</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>Compulsory school attendance laws violate the Free Exercise Clause.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment protects the right of individuals to engage in their religious rituals and practices.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>In <em>Yoder</em>, the Court held that compulsory secondary education violated the religious practice of the Amish, which prohibits education past the eighth grade.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The government may not enforce laws against individuals when such enforcement interferes with the free exercise of an individual’s religious practices.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em><span id="page_263"/>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</em> (1969)</strong> (see <a href="20_Chapter_9__Civil_Liberties.html#page_133">chapter 9</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>The First Amendment protects students’ free speech in schools, including symbolic speech.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Students wore black armbands to school in protest of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The protest was purely symbolic; the students did not speak or disrupt the school.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Court held that students’ First Amendment right to free speech is protected in schools, so long as the speech does not interfere with discipline or the operation of the school.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Wearing black armbands is a form of symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Schenck v. United States</em> (1919)</strong> (see <a href="20_Chapter_9__Civil_Liberties.html#page_133">chapter 9</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>The “Clear and Present Danger” test is established for speech protection.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>During World War I, the defendants in <em>Schenck</em> distributed literature urging young men to defy the draft and were charged with violating the Espionage Act of 1917.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The defendants argued that the charges violated their First Amendment right to free speech.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Court held that the First Amendment does not protect speech that presents a “clear and present danger” of causing serious harm that Congress has a right to prevent.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>New York Times Co. v. United States</em> (1971)</strong> (see <a href="20_Chapter_9__Civil_Liberties.html#page_133">chapter 9</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>No prior restraint of the press is allowed to the government.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Nixon administration obtained a restraining order preventing <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post</em> from publishing classified information (the Pentagon Papers) relating to the war in Vietnam that had been leaked to the press.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Pentagon Papers contained information that might be embarrassing to the government, but not harmful to military operations.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Court held that, under the First Amendment, the government could not restrain the press from publishing information unless the government could meet a very high burden, which the Court did not clearly define.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em><span id="page_264"/>McDonald v. Chicago</em> (2010)</strong> (see <a href="20_Chapter_9__Civil_Liberties.html#page_133">chapter 9</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>The right to keep and bear arms applies to states.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>A Chicago ordinance prohibited the possession of handguns. Otis McDonald, a city resident who lived in a dangerous neighborhood, argued that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual the right to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Supreme Court incorporated the Second Amendment against the states and struck down the Chicago handgun ordinance.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Gideon v. Wainwright (1963)</em></strong> (see <a href="20_Chapter_9__Civil_Liberties.html#page_133">chapter 9</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>The right to counsel</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Clarence Earl Gideon was charged with breaking into a pool hall and stealing cash, a felony.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Although Gideon was indigent (too poor to pay for an attorney), he was not entitled to a public defender under Florida law because he was not charged with a capital (death penalty) crime.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Supreme Court incorporated the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel, holding that all felony defendants are entitled to an attorney paid by the state if they fall below a minimum financial threshold.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Roe v. Wade</em> (1973)</strong> (see <a href="20_Chapter_9__Civil_Liberties.html#page_133">chapter 9</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>The right to abortion</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Norma McCorvey (pseudonym “Jane Roe”) was denied an abortion in Texas and challenged the constitutionality of Texas’s restrictive abortion law.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Supreme Court held that the right to privacy (not explicitly stated in the Constitution, but established in a previous case) protects a woman’s right to access an abortion.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C505"><em><strong>Note that civil liberties cases always involve balancing the rights of the individual against the rights of others or society at large. The individual freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights are not absolute. Civil liberties do not allow individuals to violate the rights of others. Keep in mind that one person’s rights end where another’s begin.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p class="C831"><strong><span id="page_265"/>4<span class="C566">.</span>Civil Rights</strong></p>
<p class="C2154">Civil rights claims are based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and require the government to protect members of certain minority groups against discrimination.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em> (1954)</strong> (see <a href="21_Chapter_10__Civil_Rights.html#page_157">chapter 10</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>Separate is not equal: No legal segregation of public education.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>African American children were required under Kansas law to attend racially segregated schools.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Court overturned the separate but equal doctrine, established in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> (1896), which allowed segregation in public accommodations so long as the facilities offered to blacks and whites were roughly equal.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>In <em>Brown</em>, the Court held that separate is inherently unequal and unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="C831"><strong>5<span class="C566">.</span>Redistricting</strong></p>
<p class="C2154">Redistricting involves creating new district boundaries for legislative representation.</p>
<p class="C2154">The Court has heard several cases related to creating both congressional districts and districts for state legislatures. The Court has ruled, over a series of cases, that, based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, legislative districts must be roughly equal in population or the “one person, one vote” principle.</p>
<p class="C2154">In terms of legislative districts, the Court has ruled that districts must be drawn so that they are roughly equal in population, are contiguous and connected, and do not dilute minority voting strength. However, district lines cannot be drawn solely based upon race <em>(Shaw v. Reno</em>).</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Baker v. Carr</em> (1962)</strong> (see <a href="15_Chapter_5__The_Legislative_Branc.html#page_61">chapter 5</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>Courts have the power to evaluate the constitutionality of redistricting schemes.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span><em>Baker</em> is important because the Court held that redistricting may be a justiciable question (something the courts can decide) and not merely a political question (something for the legislature or executive). That is, courts have the authority to decide redistricting decisions. (Partisan gerrymandering claims are considered nonjusticiable under <em>Rucho v. Common Cause</em>, 2019.)</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a"><span id="page_266"/>➤</span>In a series of cases based on the <em>Baker</em> decision, the Court went on to establish the principle that legislative districts must be approximately equal in population, so that each citizen’s vote is equally weighted. (The “one person, one vote” principle.)</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Shaw v. Reno (1993)</em></strong> (see <a href="15_Chapter_5__The_Legislative_Branc.html#page_61">chapter 5</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>Redistricting based on race is subject to strict scrutiny.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>North Carolina created a congressional district map with two majority-minority districts, intended to increase the number of representatives from North Carolina representing African Americans. (<em>Majority-minority</em> districts are those in which a more than half of voters are members of a minority group.) The new map had been drawn so as to comply with minority voting rights under the Voting Rights Act of 1965<span class="C566">.</span></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Court struck down the map, holding that although congressional district maps must comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a district drawn based solely on race must pass strict scrutiny: it must be drawn with a compelling state interest in mind, be narrowly tailored to meet that need, and be the least restrictive means for achieving the goal.</p>
<p class="C831"><strong>6<span class="C566">.</span>Campaign Finance</strong></p>
<p class="C2154">It has long been recognized that financing campaigns can result in the disproportionate influence of well-funded interests, as well as political corruption.</p>
<p class="C2154">Various federal laws have attempted to limit the influence of money in political campaigns within the limitations of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="C2154"><strong><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em> (2010)</strong> (see <a href="26_Chapter_13__Political_Parties__I.html#page_199">chapter 13</a>)</p>
<p class="C2315"><em>Campaign spending is speech protected by the First Amendment.</em></p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Citizens United, a conservative nonprofit organization, challenged restrictions placed by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act on advertising intended to influence elections by corporations and other organizations.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>The Court held that the First Amendment’s free speech protections apply to corporations, labor unions, and other organizations, and that BCRA restrictions violated those rights.</p>
<p class="C2292"><span class="C566a">➤</span>Spending by organizations to influence elections may not be limited so long as there is no coordination between the organization and the candidate or campaign.</p>
