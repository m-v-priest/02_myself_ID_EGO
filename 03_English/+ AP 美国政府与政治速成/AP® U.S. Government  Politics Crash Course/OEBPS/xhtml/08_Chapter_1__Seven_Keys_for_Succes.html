</div>
<p class="C965"><span class="C566"><strong>3.</strong></span><strong>APPLY THE BIG IDEAS</strong></p>
<p class="C2383">While reviewing each of the five units, reference the 5 big ideas, discussed below, in the context of U.S. government and politics as well as how political scientists study political behavior.</p>
<p class="C998"><strong>BIG IDEA 1. Constitutionalism:</strong> The structure and policies of the U.S. government involve both federalism and separation of powers, among the three independent branches that provide checks and balances on each other. Government is based on the rule of law and respect for majority rule and minority rights.</p>
<div class="C1038">
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>The Constitution was a product of compromises to overcome the weaknesses in the Articles of Confederation. It remains a model of representative democracy and limited government.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Principles of federalism, popular sovereignty, separation of powers, and checks and balances are reflected in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>The legislative branch was designed to reflect the ideals of republicanism.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566"><span id="page_7"/>•</span>Powers of the executive branch have been expanded beyond those outlined in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>The judicial branch as created by the Constitution and the power of judicial review are an independent check on the other branches.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Supreme Court’s judicial review of laws and government actions based on the Constitution is influenced by the composition of the justices on the court and citizen–government interactions.</p>
</div>
<p class="C998"><strong>BIG IDEA 2. Liberty and Order:</strong> The structure and policies of the U.S. government involve a balance between individual freedom and collective security based on the Constitution. The Bill of Rights has been interpreted by the judicial branch to balance the need for government authority and the protection of civil liberties. Examples in this book show how the Bill of Rights has been selectively incorporated to limit the authority of the states over its citizens under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<div class="C1038">
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Models of participatory, pluralist, and elitist democracy illustrate the ambivalence of the founders and political theorists toward unrestricted mass participation in governance.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>The Constitution and its Bill of Rights have long been interpreted by the courts to balance individual liberties with societal requirements for order and stability.</p>
</div>
<p class="C998"><strong>BIG IDEA 3. Civic Participation in a Representative Democracy:</strong> The ideals of popular sovereignty, individualism, and republicanism influence laws and policy-making and are based on the idea that citizens will be involved.</p>
<div class="C1038">
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Several provisions of the Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, have been interpreted to ensure equality in American society.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Federal laws and policies on elections, voting, and campaign finance are viewed differently across the political spectrum.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Today’s media outlets provide citizens with information about public policy and influence how citizens participate in government.</p>
</div>
<p class="C998"><strong><span id="page_8"/>BIG IDEA 4. Competing Policy-Making Interests:</strong> Public policy results from input from various public and private institutions and individuals at the federal, state, and local levels.</p>
<div class="C1038">
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>The Constitution uses the doctrines of separation of powers and checks and balances to preserve individual rights and make sure the government represents the will of the people.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>The massive federal bureaucracy has a vital role in the implementation of public policy, which is sometimes challenged for lacking accountability.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Public policy on civil rights has been shaped by public opinion, social movements, legislation, and court rulings.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Major political ideologies influence public policy debates and decisions.</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Linkage institutions (e.g., political parties, interest groups, elections, and the media) create pathways for political participation and policy input.</p>
</div>
<p class="C998"><strong>BIG IDEA 5. Methods of Political Analysis:</strong> Political scientists use scientific polling and data analysis to evaluate political participation, ideologies, and government institutions. This data influences policy and often electoral outcomes. Citizen attitudes about government, including political ideology, efficacy, and participation, are based on the influence of many actors: demographic characteristics, family culture, social events, education, and the media.</p>
<p class="C463"><img alt="" class="Image369" src="../img/18_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C2406">
<p class="C1049"><em><strong>The big idea of methods of political analysis applies across the entire AP® course and thus appears on both multiple-choice and free-response questions on the exam. You will be expected to analyze data sets, graphs, charts, and political science reading passages.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p class="C965"><span class="C566"><strong>4.</strong></span><strong>FOCUS ON THE CONSTITUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C2383">Though nine foundational documents are represented on the exam, none is more important than the Constitution. It is the one most frequently cited in free-response answers. The Constitution consists of three main parts:</p>
<div class="C1038">
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Preamble</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Articles (7)</p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566">•</span>Amendments (27) including the Bill of Rights</p>
</div>
<p class="C965"><span class="C566"><strong><span id="page_9"/>5.</strong></span><strong>ANALYZE SOURCES LIKE A POLITICAL SCIENTIST</strong></p>
<p class="C2383">Both the multiple-choice and free-response questions require analysis of various primary and secondary sources. Primary sources include the nine foundational documents and opinions from the fifteen required Supreme Court cases. Detailed information aiding in this analysis are found throughout this book. Secondary sources include quotes from political science research articles, editorials, and books in which various political theories are presented.</p>
<p class="C2383"><strong>Foundational Documents:</strong> This book connects the nine foundational documents to the philosophical underpinnings of U.S. government and American political values. It also applies them to key political science terminology and concepts. The nine foundational documents are:</p>
<div class="C1012">
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566"><strong>•</strong></span>The <em>Declaration of Independence</em></p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566"><strong>•</strong></span>The <em>Articles of Confederation</em></p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566"><strong>•</strong></span>The <em>Constitution of the United States</em> including the <em>Bill of Rights</em></p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566"><strong>•</strong></span><em>Brutus No. 1</em></p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566"><strong>•</strong></span><em>Federalist Nos. 10, 51, 70, 78</em></p>
<p class="C1022"><span class="C566"><strong>•</strong></span><em>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</em> (Martin Luther King, Jr.)</p>
</div>
<p class="C2383"><strong>Required Supreme Court Cases:</strong> An understanding of the fifteen required Supreme Court cases includes the facts of the case, constitutional issues raised, the holding and its reasoning, and any important implications or related vocabulary. Each decision should be considered in relation to the idea of precedent and the impact on public policy, as well as the relationship between the branches of government and between the government and the citizens and residents of the United States. The required cases will be included on the SCOTUS comparison free-response question as well as in multiple-choice questions. The cases, which follow, represent seven legal categories.</p>

<div class="C2406">
<p class="C1049"><em><strong>Some of the SCOTUS cases fall into multiple categories. For example,</strong></em> <strong>Gideon <em>is a Sixth Amendment (Bill of Rights) case, but it is also an example of selective incorporation.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p class="C2383"><strong>Text-Based Sources:</strong> The exam requires you to analyze documentary sources in terms of how they relate to key principles of U.S. government. These sources include historical documents or modern writings by political scientists and historians. You may be asked to analyze the perspective of the author, identify the author’s thesis and reasoning in your own words, explain evidence to support the argument, or describe an alternate perspective. Be prepared to explain the potential implications of the author’s reasoning.</p>
<p class="C2383"><strong>Quantitative Sources:</strong> Both the multiple-choice and free-response questions require analysis of quantitative data (measured numerically) presented in graph or chart form. You will be asked to identify similarities, differences, and trends, as well as reach accurate conclusions that apply your knowledge of course material. You will also be asked to explain the importance of the information in the data.</p>
<p class="C2383"><strong><span id="page_11"/>Visual Sources:</strong> The exam will include various visual sources, including cartoons, maps, and infographics. Thus, you will need to interpret information presented graphically, which means familiarizing yourself with the concepts of viewpoint, data point, trends, implications, limitations, and sources.</p>
