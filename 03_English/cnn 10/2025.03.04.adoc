Yesterday, we talked about Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky's ​_heated (a.) exchange_​(短暂的交谈，争吵；交战，交火) 激烈交锋 last week with US President Donald Trump. Well, this weekend, leaders from _across the continent_ 横穿大陆(指欧洲) and Canada ​gathered *in support of* 支持、赞成某事物 Ukraine, meeting in the United Kingdom. President Zelensky spent an hour with _King Charles III_ 国王查尔斯三世 at his ​royal estate​ 皇家庄园, then joined British _Prime Minister_ 首相，总理 Kia Starmer in a ​gathering of Western leaders​ 西方领导人集会 in London, who ​welcomed the Ukrainian president as a guest of honor​ 以贵宾身份欢迎乌克兰总统.

The European leaders ​presented a united front​ 展现统一战线 in their ​stance （公开表明的）观点，态度，立场；（尤指体育运动中的）站立姿势 in the Russia-Ukraine war​ 俄乌战争立场, as the countries work (v.) to ​build a plan for a ceasefire​ 制定停火计划 in Ukraine. The _prime minister_ said the goal of the meeting was ​① addressing Ukraine's short-term needs​ 解决乌克兰短期需求, ②​securing (v.)获得，设法得到 a lasting deal​ 达成持久协议 to end the conflict,  ③ and ​planning _security guarantees_​ 规划安全保障 for Ukraine's future.

[.my2]
昨天我们提到乌克兰总统泽连斯基与特朗普的激烈交锋。本周末，欧洲多国及加拿大领导人在英国集会支持乌克兰。泽连斯基与英国首相斯塔默共同出席伦敦的西方领导人会议，并以贵宾身份受到欢迎。欧洲各国在俄乌战争中展现统一战线，正制定乌克兰停火计划。首相表示会议目标是解决乌克兰短期需求、达成持久停战协议，并规划其未来安全保障。

Right now, European ​negotiation efforts​ 谈判努力 appear (v.)​*at odds with*​ 与…不一致；有分歧 the Trump administration's approach 方法，态度 in ​opening (v.) diplomatic talks​ 开启外交谈判 with Russia last month, ​*calling into question*​ 质疑;对……表示怀疑 whether the US will ​*get on board​ 参与;上船 with* any future European ceasefire plan. CNN's Nick Robertson shows us how the ​historic weekend​ 历史性周末 ​unfolded​ 展开；呈现，逐渐明朗；发生，发展.

So, President Zelensky getting an important meeting with King Charles at one of the king's ​country residences​ 乡村住所, about 100 miles north of London, Sandringham 地名. They spent an hour together, and it's important ​symbolically​ 象征性地 because it ​embodies​ 体现, if you will, the support that the UK is giving to the Ukrainian president.

But remembering as well, just a few days ago when the British Prime Minister Kia Starmer was in the ​Oval Office​ 椭圆形办公室 with President Trump, he ​handed​ 递交 President Trump a letter, an ​unprecedented invitation​ 前所未有的邀请 to President Trump of a second ​state visit​ 国事访问 to the UK.

So here, Zelensky getting the ​royal treatment​ 皇家礼遇 as well, embodying (v.)具体表现，体现，代表（思想或品质）;包括；包含；收录 that support from the British government, the British people, and the ​monarchy​ 君主制.

Before he was there, he was at that ​gathering (n.) of European leaders​ 欧洲领导人集会, as well as Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, being ​hosted by​ 由…主办 the British Prime Minister.

The British Prime Minister saying that this was an ​effort​ 努力 to make sure that Ukraine has the ​military and economic needs​ 军事和经济需求 that it needs to ​fight the war​ 作战 today. He spoke about an ​additional $2 billion of funding​ 额外20亿美元资金 going to Ukraine, Ukraine *spending* that *on* ​air defense missiles​ 防空导弹, 5,000 of them to be ​purchased​ 购买 in the UK. All of that very, very important.

[.my2]
目前，欧洲的斡旋努力似乎与特朗普政府上月开启对俄外交对话的立场存在分歧，这让人质疑美国是否会支持未来任何欧洲提出的停火计划。 +
CNN记者尼克·罗伯森带我们回顾这个具有历史意义的周末。乌克兰总统泽连斯基在距伦敦以北约100英里的桑德灵厄姆庄园与查尔斯国王举行重要会晤，这座庄园是国王的乡间居所之一。双方会谈持续一小时，这次会晤的象征意义重大，因为它体现了英国对乌克兰总统的支持。值得关注的是，就在几天前，英国首相基尔·斯塔默曾在白宫椭圆形办公室与特朗普会面，并向其递交了一封邀请函——前所未有地邀请特朗普对英国进行第二次国事访问。 +
因此，泽连斯基此次获得王室礼遇，同样彰显着英国政府、人民及王室对其的支持。 +
此前，泽连斯基还出席了由英国首相主持的欧洲领导人峰会，加拿大总理特鲁多也参与其中。英国首相表示，此举旨在确保乌克兰获得当前战事所需的军事和经济支持。他宣布将向乌克兰追加20亿美元资金援助，乌克兰将用这笔资金在英国采购5000枚防空导弹。所有这些举措都具有极其重要的意义。


But _some of the ​key details​ 关键细节 that we began to learn_ `系` was that `主` this was something of an ​historic moment​ 历史性时刻. That's the way Starmer saw it, that this was _a ​crossroads 十字路口；交叉路口 in history_​ 历史十字路口 where he was trying to ​build a coalition​ 建立联盟 of __the ​willing European nations__​ 自愿的欧洲国家, ​forward-leaning​ 前瞻性的, able to ​step up​ 站出来 and be part of the ​security guarantees​ 安全保障.

This is how he ​framed (v.)（以某种方式）表达；勾勒出明显的形象 it​ : "Not every nation will feel able to ​contribute​ 贡献, but that can't mean that we ​*sit back*​ 袖手旁观;舒服地坐下. Instead, those willing 愿意的，乐意的 `谓` will ​intensify (v.) planning​ 加强规划 now with ​real urgency​ 真正的紧迫性. The UK has prepared to ​back (v.)支持 this​ 支持 with ​_boots 靴子 on the ground_​ 地面部队 and ​_planes in the air_​ 空中力量. Together with others, Europe must do the ​_heavy lifting_​ 搬抬重物，搬運重物, （工作）最主要的方面;（任務）最困難的部分, but to ​support (v.) peace​ 支持和平 in our continent and to ​succeed​ (v.)成功, this effort must have ​strong US backing​ 美国的强力支持."

And that very important point there, the need to have US support here, and he spoke about it in this way as well, that France, the UK, and Ukraine would ​work (v.) on this plan​ 制定计划 with the European nations and then ​bring it to the White House​ 提交白宫. So in a way, they feel like #感觉像是​shielding​# (v.)保护 President Zelensky *to some degree* 在某种程度上；有点，稍微 #from# _sort of 有点儿​getting in a one-on-one (a.)一对一的；直接对立的 situation_​ 陷入一对一局面 in the White House with President Trump again, um, that turned (v.) so ​fractious​ (a.)易怒的 just a few days ago.

[.my2]
“但我们开始了解到的一些关键细节是，这是一个历史性的时刻。斯塔默就是这么看的，这是一个历史的十字路口，他试图建立一个由意愿合作的欧洲国家组成的联盟，这些国家积极进取，能够挺身而出，参与安全保障。他是这样阐述的：‘不是每个国家都认为自己有能力做出贡献，但这并不意味着我们可以袖手旁观。相反，那些愿意的国家现在将以真正的紧迫感加强规划。英国已准备好以地面部队和空中力量来支持这一行动。欧洲必须与其他国家一起承担重任，但为了支持我们大陆的和平并取得成功，这一努力必须得到美国的强力支持。’ 这一点非常重要，即需要美国的支持。他还以这种方式谈到，法国、英国和乌克兰将与欧洲国家共同制定这项计划，然后将其提交给白宫。因此，在某种程度上，他们似乎是在保护泽连斯基总统，避免他再次与特朗普总统在白宫进行一对一的会面，因为几天前的那次会面变得非常激烈。”

Hello sunshine, I'm Coy Wire. Welcome to CNN 10, your 10 minutes of news where I simply tell you the "what," letting you decide what to think. Hope you're off to a terrific Tuesday so far. If not, smell the flowers, cool the soup, and let's get to it.

We begin today on the East Coast of the US, as wildfires scorch part of the Carolinas. Dry, windy conditions ignited nearly 200 wildfires in South Carolina alone, according to the governor's office there, who declared a state of emergency over the weekend to support firefighting efforts across the state. The Carolina Forest Fire has already burned more than 1,000 acres just north of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In North Carolina, a brush fire caused by a fallen power line along an interstate highway spread quickly up a nearby mountain, threatening several structures. Some residents near the highway were ordered to evacuate. Firefighters have been working to put out fires in both states and have been able to contain many of the smaller fires.  

The fire threat continued for the region early in the week, though higher humidity and lighter winds in the forecast are expected to help quell the fires in the coming days. Fires here are not unusual, with South Carolina seeing nearly 5,000 every year, according to state emergency management teams. We hope everyone watching from the area is staying safe and out of harm's way.  

Yesterday, we talked about Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky's heated exchange last week with US President Donald Trump. Well, this weekend, leaders from across the continent and Canada gathered in support of Ukraine, meeting in the United Kingdom. President Zelensky spent an hour with King Charles III at his royal estate, then joined British Prime Minister Kia Starmer in a gathering of Western leaders in London, who welcomed the Ukrainian president as a guest of honor. The European leaders presented a united front in their stance in the Russia-Ukraine war, as the countries work to build a plan for a ceasefire in Ukraine. The prime minister said the goal of the meeting was addressing Ukraine's short-term needs, securing a lasting deal to end the conflict, and planning security guarantees for Ukraine's future.  

Right now, European negotiation efforts appear at odds with the Trump administration's approach in opening diplomatic talks with Russia last month, calling into question whether the US will get on board with any future European ceasefire plan. CNN's Nick Robertson shows us how the historic weekend unfolded. So, President Zelensky getting an important meeting with King Charles at one of the king's country residences, about 100 miles north of London, Sandringham. They spent an hour together, and it's important symbolically because it embodies, if you will, the support that the UK is giving to the Ukrainian president. But remembering as well, just a few days ago when the British Prime Minister Kia Starmer was in the Oval Office with President Trump, he handed President Trump a letter, an unprecedented invitation to President Trump of a second state visit to the UK. So here, Zelensky getting the royal treatment as well, embodying that support from the British government, the British people, and the monarchy. Before he was there, he was at that gathering of European leaders, as well as Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, being hosted by the British Prime Minister. The British Prime Minister saying that this was an effort to make sure that Ukraine has the military and economic needs that it needs to fight the war today. He spoke about an additional $2 billion of funding going to Ukraine, Ukraine spending that on air defense missiles, 5,000 of them to be purchased in the UK. All of that very, very important. But some of the key details that we began to learn was that this was something of an historic moment. That's the way Starmer saw it, that this was a crossroads in history where he was trying to build a coalition of the willing European nations, forward-leaning, able to step up and be part of the security guarantees. This is how he framed it: "Not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can't mean that we sit back. Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency. The UK has prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air. Together with others, Europe must do the heavy lifting, but to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing." And that very important point there, the need to have US support here, and he spoke about it in this way as well, that France, the UK, and Ukraine would work on this plan with the European nations and then bring it to the White House. So in a way, they feel like shielding President Zelensky to some degree from sort of getting in a one-on-one situation in the White House with President Trump again, um, that turned so fractious just a few days ago.
