Chapter 2 - Key Terms

=== I. RENAISSANCE AND EXPLORATION, c. 1450 to c. 1648

1.HUMANISM—The scholarly interest in the study of the classical texts, values, and styles of Greece and Rome. Humanism contributed to the promotion of a liberal arts education based on the study of the classics, rhetoric, and history.

2.CHRISTIAN HUMANISM—A branch of humanism associated with northern Europe. Like their Italian counterparts, the Christian humanists closely studied classical texts. However, they also sought to give humanism a specifically Christian content. Christian humanists like Desiderius Erasmus were committed to religious piety and institutional reform.

3.VERNACULAR—The everyday language of a region or country. Miguel de Cervantes, Geoffrey Chaucer, Dante, and Martin Luther all encouraged the development of their national languages by writing in the vernacular. Desiderius Erasmus, however, continued to write in Latin.

4.NEW MONARCHS—European monarchs who created professional armies and a more centralized administrative bureaucracy. The new monarchs also negotiated a new relationship with the Catholic Church. Key new monarchs include Charles VII, Louis XI, Henry VII, and Ferdinand and Isabella.

5.SECULARISM—Promoted by the Humanists and the Renaissance. Trend toward making religious faith a private domain rather than one directly connected to state power. Promoted a search for nonreligious explanations for political authority and natural phenomena.

6.COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE—The interchange of plants, animals, diseases, and human populations between the Old World and the New World. Opened new opportunities for Europeans while at the same time creating a demographic catastrophe for indigenous peoples in the Americas.

7.MERCANTILISM—Economic philosophy calling for close government regulation of the economy. Mercantilist theory emphasized building a strong, self-sufficient economy by maximizing exports and limiting imports. Mercantilists supported the acquisition of colonies as sources of raw materials and markets for finished goods. This favorable balance of trade would enable a country to accumulate reserves of gold and silver. Mercantilism gave the new monarchies a leading role in promoting commercial development and the acquisition of New World colonies.

8.COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION—Innovations in banking and finance that promoted the growth of urban financial centers and a money economy.

9.JOINT-STOCK COMPANY—A business arrangement in which many investors raise money for a venture too large for any of them to undertake alone.

=== II. AGE OF REFORMATION, c. 1450 to c. 1648

10.INDULGENCE—A certificate granted by the pope in return for the payment of a fee to the church. The certificate stated that the soul of the dead relative or friend of the purchaser would have his time in purgatory reduced by many years or canceled altogether.

12.PREDESTINATION—Doctrine espoused by John Calvin that God has known since the beginning of time who will be saved and who will be damned. Calvin declared that “by an eternal and immutable counsel, God has once and for all determined, both whom he would admit to salvation, and whom he would condemn to destruction.”

13.HUGUENOTS—French Protestants who followed the teachings of John Calvin.

14.POLITIQUES—Rulers who put political necessities above personal beliefs. For example, both Henry IV of France and Elizabeth I of England subordinated theological controversies in order to achieve political unity.

15.PUTTING-OUT SYSTEM—A pre-industrial manufacturing system in which an entrepreneur would bring materials to rural people who worked on them in their own homes. For example, watch manufacturers in Swiss towns employed villagers to make parts for their products. The system enabled entrepreneurs to avoid restrictive guild regulations.

16.BAROQUE ART—An artistic style of the seventeenth century that featured dramatic action, intense emotions, and exaggerated lighting. Monarchies, city-states, and the Catholic Church commissioned Baroque works as a means of promoting their own stature and power.

17.ABSOLUTISM—A system of government in which the ruler claims sole and uncontestable power. Absolute monarchs were not limited by constitutional restraints.

18.DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS—The idea that rulers receive their authority from God and are answerable only to God. Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, a French bishop and court preacher to Louis XIV, provided the theological justification for the divine right of kings by declaring that “the state of monarchy is the supremest thing on earth, for kings are not only God’s lieutenants upon earth and sit upon God’s throne, but even by God himself are called gods. In the Scriptures, kings are called Gods, and their power is compared to the divine powers.”

19.INTENDANTS—French royal officials who supervised provincial governments in the name of the king. Intendants played a key role in establishing French absolutism.

30.AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION—The innovations in farm production that began in eighteenth-century Holland and spread to England. These advances replaced the open-field agriculture system with a more scientific and mechanized system of agriculture that produced more food with fewer workers, increased food supply, and reduced the number of demographic crises caused by major epidemic diseases.
