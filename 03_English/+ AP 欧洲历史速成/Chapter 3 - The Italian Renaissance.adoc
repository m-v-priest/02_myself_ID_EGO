Chapter 3 - The Italian Renaissance

=== I. RISE OF THE ITALIAN CITY-STATES

A.URBAN CENTERS

1.While the rest of Europe was still rural, a number of cities prospered in northern Italy.

2.By the late 1300s, Florence, Venice, and Milan all had populations of about 100,000.

B.WEALTHY MERCHANTS

1.In the absence of hereditary kings, wealthy merchants formed oligarchies that governed the independent city-states in northern Italy.

2.Wealthy merchant families dominated political, economic, and artistic life in the northern Italian cities.

=== II. FLORENCE AND THE MEDICI

A.THE PRIMACY OF FLORENCE

1.During the fifteenth century, or Quattrocento, Florence became the acknowledged center of the Renaissance—the rebirth of classical learning, literature, and art.

2.The golden age of Florence was based on the wealth earned by its textile merchants and bankers.

B.THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MEDICI

1.The Medici family dominated Florence’s economic, political, and artistic life for much of the fifteenth century.

2.The Medici earned their wealth as bankers. Led by Cosimo (1389–1464), Piero (1416–1469), and Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449–1492), the Medici financed libraries, built churches, sponsored the Platonic Academy of Philosophy, and commissioned hundreds of artworks.

3.The Florentine Renaissance reached its peak during the lifetime of Lorenzo the Magnificent.

=== III. THE RENAISSANCE SPIRIT

A.THE MEDIEVAL MINDSET

1.Medieval thinkers believed that God had created the world to prepare humans for salvation or eternal damnation. Human beings and their lives on earth were equally insignificant. The individual was of no importance.

2.Medieval artists did not win fame as individuals. The architects, glassmakers, and sculptors who designed and decorated Europe’s great cathedrals worked for the glory of God, not for personal glory.

B.A NEW CELEBRATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL

1.Unlike feudal nobles, Italian merchants did not inherit their social rank. Success in business depended mostly on the merchants’ own skill. As a result, prosperous merchants took pride in their achievements. They believed they were successful because of their merit as individuals.

2.Like the merchants, northern Italian artists and writers were eager to be known and remembered as individuals. From this time on, we know the names of people who created works of art. Fame thus became a reward for superior talent.

3.Portrait painting and autobiography illustrate the interest in individual personality and fame. Wealthy patrons wanted their portraits recorded for posterity. Renaissance artists often included self-portraits in their paintings. Autobiographies were the written equivalents of self-portraits.

4.Renaissance individualism stressed the importance of personality, the development of unique talents, and the pursuit of fame and glory. By displaying the full range of human abilities, a Renaissance person demonstrated the highly prized trait known as virtu.

5.In his famous Oration on the Dignity of Man, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola celebrated the human potential for greatness.

C.HUMANIST SCHOLARS AND THE LOVE OF CLASSICAL LEARNING

1.Petrarch and other Renaissance scholars scorned medieval art and literature. Petrarch summed up the Renaissance attitude by calling the medieval years “the Dark Ages.”

2.Scholars such as Petrarch who studied the classical texts and cultures of ancient Greece and Rome were called humanists.

3.Inspired by classical authors, humanists rejected medieval scholasticism and instead advocated a curriculum based on the study of Greek and Roman literature, rhetoric, and history. Humanists believed that by studying the classics they would gain a more practical understanding of human nature.

4.Humanists played a key role in promoting the new liberal arts education, developing vernacular languages, and renewing interest in translating and preserving Greek and Roman manuscripts.

5.Humanists believed that contact with the classical past would enrich their own culture by promoting civic responsibility, encouraging artistic creativity, and rewarding individual excellence.

6.Lorenzo Valla demonstrated the power of Renaissance scholarship when he used a careful linguistic and historical analysis to demonstrate that the Donation of Constantine was actually a clumsy forgery.

D.A NEW SECULAR SPIRIT

1.Medieval culture emphasized spiritual values and salvation.

2.Renaissance culture was far more interested in the pleasures of material possessions. Wealthy Renaissance families openly enjoyed fine music, expensive foods, and beautiful works of art.

=== IV. EDUCATION AND THE IDEAL COURTIER

A.HUMANIST EDUCATION

1.Medieval scholastics studied the classics to understand God. In contrast, Renaissance humanists studied the classics to understand human nature and learn practical skills.

2.Leading humanists opened schools and academies that taught Roman history, Greek philosophy, and Latin grammar and rhetoric.

3.Humanists believed that their classical curriculum would teach future business, political, and military leaders how to become eloquent and persuasive speakers and writers.

B.BALDASSARE CASTIGLIONE (1478–1529)

1.For Renaissance humanists, the ideal individual strove to become a “universal man” who excelled in many fields.

2.In his book The Courtier, Baldassare Castiglione explained how upper-class men and women could become accomplished courtiers.

3.According to Castiglione, the ideal courtier should be polite, charming, and witty. He should be able to dance, write poetry, sing, and play music. In addition, he should be physically graceful and strong.

4.Castiglione did not ignore upper-class women. The perfect court lady, he said, should be well educated and charming. Yet women were not expected to seek fame as men did. Like Dante’s Beatrice and Petrarch’s Laura, they were expected to inspire poetry and art but rarely to create it.

=== V. MACHIAVELLI AND THE PRINCE

A.TURMOIL IN ITALY

1.The golden age of Florence lasted nearly a century. Lorenzo the Magnificent’s unexpected death in 1492 left Florence without a strong leader.

2.In 1494, King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy with the goal of conquering Naples. Spain’s King Ferdinand soon contested the French claim to Naples.

3.These invasions sparked a series of conflicts called the Habsburg-Valois Wars that involved all the major Italian city-states. Diplomacy and war became the keys to survival.

B.NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI (1469–1527)

1.Machiavelli was a Florentine diplomat and political philosopher. He is considered the founder of modern political science.

2.Machiavelli was appalled by the devastation caused by the Habsburg-Valois Wars. “At this time,” he passionately wrote, “the whole land of Italy is without a head, without order, beaten, spoiled, torn in pieces, overrun, and abandoned to destruction in every shape. She prays to God to send someone to rescue her from these barbarous cruelties.”

3.Machiavelli wrote The Prince to advise Italian rulers on the ruthless statecraft needed to unite his war-torn and divided Italian homeland.

C.THE QUALITIES OF A SUCCESSFUL PRINCE

1.Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of human nature. He believed that people are “ungrateful, changeable, simulators and dissimulators, runaways in danger, eager for gain; while you do well by them they are all yours; they offer you their blood, their property, their lives, their children when need is far off; but when it comes near you, they turn about.”

2.Because human nature is selfish, untrustworthy, and corrupt, a prince must be strong as a lion and shrewd as a fox: “For the lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to fight wolves.”

3.The successful ruler, Machiavelli insisted, must be ruthless and pragmatic, always remembering that the end justifies the means.


In The Prince, Machiavelli suggested that a ruler should behave both “like a lion” and “like a fox.” Be prepared for a short-answer essay question asking you to summarize Machiavelli’s key points and apply them to rulers such as Elizabeth I of England, Henry IV of France, and Frederick II of Prussia.

=== VI. ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART

A.PATRONS

1.Renaissance artists were not independent contractors who produced works of art for themselves or the public. Instead, they received commissions from the Catholic Church, guilds, and wealthy families such as the Medici.

2.While these patrons appreciated the beauty of fine art, they also understood the ability of artists to create visible symbols of power. Renaissance patrons thus used art as a way of displaying their wealth and promoting their fame.

B.CHARACTERISTICS OF RENAISSANCE ART

1.Perspective

i.A geometric method of creating the illusion of depth on a flat, two-dimensional surface.

ii.Enabled artists to create paintings that opened “a window on the world.” This way of presenting space became the foundation of European painting for the next 500 years.

2.Chiaroscuro

i.The realistic blending of light and shade to model forms.

ii.Creates the illusion of volume.

iii.Chiaroscuro and perspective enabled artists to create paintings in which real people seemed to occupy real space.

3.Pyramid configuration

i.Byzantine and medieval art featured flat, rigid figures arranged in a horizontal line.

ii.Renaissance artists used three-dimensional pyramid configurations to create symmetrical and balanced compositions.

4.Classical forms and Christian subjects

i.Inspired by their study of Greek and Roman statues, Renaissance artists attempted to revive classical standards of beauty.

ii.It is important to remember that Renaissance artists did not abandon Christian themes and subjects. Rather, Renaissance art often combined classical forms with Christian subjects.


You do not need to memorize a long list of Renaissance artists and their works of art. Instead, focus on key masterpieces that illustrate Renaissance ideals and the impact of humanism. The five works described below are designed to provide you with a handy list of examples for multiple-choice and short-answer essay questions on the Italian Renaissance.

C.KEY EXAMPLES OF RENAISSANCE ART AND ARCHITECTURE

1.Filippo Brunelleschi, The Dome of Florence Cathedral

i.Brunelleschi combined his knowledge of Roman engineering principles with innovative building techniques to construct a 100-foot-high dome that seemed to reach heavenward without any visible means of support.

ii.The Dome became a visible and celebrated symbol of Florence’s piety, power, and ingenuity.

2.Michelangelo, David

i.David’s contrapposto (stiff right leg and relaxed left leg) pose recalls statues from Greece and Rome.

ii.Like many classical statues, David is a nude. However, unlike the serene classical statues, David defiantly faces Goliath. His muscular body is tense with gathering power as God’s champion prepares for battle.

iii.David can be viewed as a metaphor for Florence’s victory over Milan. David symbolizes Florence while the unseen Goliath symbolizes Milan.

3.Raphael, The School of Athens

i.The School of Athens depicts a gathering of ancient philosophers from various eras. The sages seem to move freely in a carefully designed three-dimensional space.

ii.The toga-clad figures of Plato and Aristotle dominate the center of the painting.

iii.Raphael underscored the rising status of Renaissance artists by including portraits of his contemporaries among the ancient philosophers. For example, Plato is a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci. Raphael also included a portrait of himself on the far right, looking out at the viewer.

iv.The School of Athens brilliantly illustrates the Renaissance ideals of order, unity, and symmetry.

4.Piero della Francesca, Federico de Montefeltro and Battista Sforza

i.State portraits became popular in fifteenth-century Italy.

ii.Piero della Francesca (1439–1492) painted a double portrait of Duke Frederico de Montefeltro and his wife Battista Sforza.

iii.The portraits celebrate the power of the aristocratic elite. For example, Federico’s hat and coat are rendered in the red color that had been conventional for portrait busts of Roman emperors.

5.Michelangelo, Sistine Chapel Ceiling

i.The 300 figures in the Sistine Chapel Ceiling represent a stunning fulfillment of the Renaissance goal of combining ancient Classical form with Christian subject matter.

ii.The Creation of Adam panel marks the culmination of a century of Renaissance research into the nature and possibilities of human anatomy. While Adam’s body has the beauty of a Greek god, his face burns with an inner intensity inspired by his closeness to God.

iii.Both the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and St. Peter’s Basilica provide visual symbols of the power of the Renaissance papacy.

=== VII. WOMEN DURING THE RENAISSANCE

A.THE DEBATE ABOUT WOMEN

1.The beginning of the Renaissance coincided with a “debate about women” (querelle des femmes).

2.Humanist scholars and others debated women’s character, nature, and role in society.

B.CHRISTINE DE PIZAN (1364–1430), THE FIRST FEMINIST

1.Pizan was a prolific writer who became the first woman in European history to earn a living as an author.

2.Pizan wrote a history of famous women designed to refute “masculine myths” about women. She is now remembered as Europe’s first feminist.

C.HUMANISM AND WOMEN

1.Renaissance humanism represented a real advance for aristocratic women.

2.Well-to-do girls received a humanistic education similar to boys. For example, young ladies studied the classics, played musical instruments, and corresponded with their families and friends.

D.CASTIGLIONE AND THE PERFECT COURT LADY

1.As mentioned earlier, Castiglione believed the perfect court lady should be attractive, well educated, and able to paint, dance, and play a musical instrument.

2.Although well educated, Castiglione’s court lady was not expected to actively participate in political, artistic, or literary affairs. Instead, she should be a pleasing and attractive “ornament” for her upper-class husband.

E.ISABELLA D’ESTE (1475–1539), THE FIRST LADY OF THE RENAISSANCE

1.Isabella d’Este was the most famous Renaissance woman.

2.She was born into the ruling family of Ferrara and married the ruler of Mantua.

3.She was an art patron whose collection included works by many of the greatest Renaissance artists. Her life illustrates that becoming a patron of the arts was the most socially acceptable role for a well-educated Renaissance woman.

4.Isabella d’Este also provides an important example of how women often played an important role in smaller Renaissance courts.

F.LIMITATIONS ON WOMEN’S LIVES

1.Humanism only affected a relatively small number of Renaissance women.

2.The vast majority of Renaissance women did not experience any significant loosening in the restraints that traditionally restricted their lives. For example, women were excluded from guilds and denied basic civil rights.

3.Renaissance women continued to lead highly circumscribed lives. They were expected to participate in the endless labor required to provide food and clothing for their families. In addition, childbearing and child-raising severely restricted their freedom.


The role of women in the Italian Renaissance provides an excellent example of the processes of continuity and change. Although a few noteworthy women in the wealthiest class did experience significant gains in status, it is important to remember that humanism did not affect the lives of the majority of Renaissance women.
