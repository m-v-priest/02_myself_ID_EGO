<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the fifteenth century, or <em>Quattrocento</em>, Florence became the acknowledged center of the Renaissance—the rebirth of classical learning, literature, and art.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The golden age of Florence was based on the wealth earned by its textile merchants and bankers.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Medici family dominated Florence’s economic, political, and artistic life for much of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Medici earned their wealth as bankers. Led by Cosimo (1389–1464), Piero (1416–1469), and Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449–1492), the Medici financed libraries, built churches, sponsored the Platonic Academy of Philosophy, and commissioned hundreds of artworks.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Florentine Renaissance reached its peak during the lifetime of Lorenzo the Magnificent.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE MEDIEVAL MINDSET</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval thinkers believed that God had created the world to prepare humans for salvation or eternal damnation. Human beings and their lives on earth were equally insignificant. The individual was of no importance.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval artists did not win fame as individuals. The architects, glassmakers, and sculptors who designed and decorated Europe’s great cathedrals worked for the glory of God, not for personal glory.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>A NEW CELEBRATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Unlike feudal nobles, Italian merchants did not inherit their social rank. Success in business depended mostly on the merchants’ own skill. As a result, prosperous merchants took pride in their achievements. They believed they were successful because of their merit as individuals.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Like the merchants, northern Italian artists and writers were eager to be known and remembered as individuals. From this time on, we know the names of people who created works of art. Fame thus became a reward for superior talent.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Portrait painting and autobiography illustrate the interest in individual personality and fame. Wealthy patrons wanted their portraits recorded for posterity. Renaissance artists often included self-portraits in their paintings. Autobiographies were the written equivalents of self-portraits.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_27"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>Renaissance individualism stressed the importance of personality, the development of unique talents, and the pursuit of fame and glory. By displaying the full range of human abilities, a Renaissance person demonstrated the highly prized trait known as <em>virtu</em>.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>In his famous <em>Oration on the Dignity of Man</em>, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola celebrated the human potential for greatness.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>HUMANIST SCHOLARS AND THE LOVE OF CLASSICAL LEARNING</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Petrarch and other Renaissance scholars scorned medieval art and literature. Petrarch summed up the Renaissance attitude by calling the medieval years “the Dark Ages.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Scholars such as Petrarch who studied the classical texts and cultures of ancient Greece and Rome were called humanists.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Inspired by classical authors, humanists rejected medieval scholasticism and instead advocated a curriculum based on the study of Greek and Roman literature, rhetoric, and history. Humanists believed that by studying the classics they would gain a more practical understanding of human nature.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Humanists played a key role in promoting the new liberal arts education, developing vernacular languages, and renewing interest in translating and preserving Greek and Roman manuscripts.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Humanists believed that contact with the classical past would enrich their own culture by promoting civic responsibility, encouraging artistic creativity, and rewarding individual excellence.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Lorenzo Valla demonstrated the power of Renaissance scholarship when he used a careful linguistic and historical analysis to demonstrate that the Donation of Constantine was actually a clumsy forgery.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>A NEW SECULAR SPIRIT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval culture emphasized spiritual values and salvation.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Renaissance culture was far more interested in the pleasures of material possessions. Wealthy Renaissance families openly enjoyed fine music, expensive foods, and beautiful works of art.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>HUMANIST EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval scholastics studied the classics to understand God. In contrast, Renaissance humanists studied the classics to understand human nature and learn practical skills.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Leading humanists opened schools and academies that taught Roman history, Greek philosophy, and Latin grammar and rhetoric.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Humanists believed that their classical curriculum would teach future business, political, and military leaders how to become eloquent and persuasive speakers and writers.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>BALDASSARE CASTIGLIONE (1478–1529)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>For Renaissance humanists, the ideal individual strove to become a “universal man” who excelled in many fields.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In his book <em>The Courtier</em>, Baldassare Castiglione explained how upper-class men and women could become accomplished courtiers.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>According to Castiglione, the ideal courtier should be polite, charming, and witty. He should be able to dance, write poetry, sing, and play music. In addition, he should be physically graceful and strong.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Castiglione did not ignore upper-class women. The perfect court lady, he said, should be well educated and charming. Yet women were not expected to seek fame as men did. Like Dante’s Beatrice and Petrarch’s Laura, they were expected to inspire poetry and art but rarely to create it.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>TURMOIL IN ITALY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The golden age of Florence lasted nearly a century. Lorenzo the Magnificent’s unexpected death in 1492 left Florence without a strong leader.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1494, King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy with the goal of conquering Naples. Spain’s King Ferdinand soon contested the French claim to Naples.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_29"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>These invasions sparked a series of conflicts called the Habsburg-Valois Wars that involved all the major Italian city-states. Diplomacy and war became the keys to survival.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI (1469–1527)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Machiavelli was a Florentine diplomat and political philosopher. He is considered the founder of modern political science.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Machiavelli was appalled by the devastation caused by the Habsburg-Valois Wars. “At this time,” he passionately wrote, “the whole land of Italy is without a head, without order, beaten, spoiled, torn in pieces, overrun, and abandoned to destruction in every shape. She prays to God to send someone to rescue her from these barbarous cruelties.”</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Machiavelli wrote <em>The Prince</em> to advise Italian rulers on the ruthless statecraft needed to unite his war-torn and divided Italian homeland.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE QUALITIES OF A SUCCESSFUL PRINCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of human nature. He believed that people are “ungrateful, changeable, simulators and dissimulators, runaways in danger, eager for gain; while you do well by them they are all yours; they offer you their blood, their property, their lives, their children when need is far off; but when it comes near you, they turn about.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Because human nature is selfish, untrustworthy, and corrupt, a prince must be strong as a lion and shrewd as a fox: “For the lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to fight wolves.”</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The successful ruler, Machiavelli insisted, must be ruthless and pragmatic, always remembering that the end justifies the means.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Renaissance artists were not independent contractors who produced works of art for themselves or the public. Instead, they received commissions from the Catholic Church, guilds, and wealthy families such as the Medici.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>While these patrons appreciated the beauty of fine art, they also understood the ability of artists to create visible symbols of power. Renaissance patrons thus used art as a way of displaying their wealth and promoting their fame.</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Byzantine and medieval art featured flat, rigid figures arranged in a horizontal line.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>KEY EXAMPLES OF RENAISSANCE ART AND ARCHITECTURE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Filippo Brunelleschi, <em>The Dome of Florence Cathedral</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Brunelleschi combined his knowledge of Roman engineering principles with innovative building techniques to construct a 100-foot-high dome that seemed to reach heavenward without any visible means of support.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Dome became a visible and celebrated symbol of Florence’s piety, power, and ingenuity.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Michelangelo, <em>David</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span><em>David’</em>s contrapposto (stiff right leg and relaxed left leg) pose recalls statues from Greece and Rome.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Like many classical statues, <em>David</em> is a nude. However, unlike the serene classical statues, <em>David</em> defiantly faces Goliath. His muscular body is tense with gathering power as God’s champion prepares for battle.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span><em>David</em> can be viewed as a metaphor for Florence’s victory over Milan. <em>David</em> symbolizes Florence while the unseen Goliath symbolizes Milan.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Raphael, <em>The School of Athens</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span><em>The School of Athens</em> depicts a gathering of ancient philosophers from various eras. The sages seem to move freely in a carefully designed three-dimensional space.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The toga-clad figures of Plato and Aristotle dominate the center of the painting.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_32"/><span class="C520">iii.</span>Raphael underscored the rising status of Renaissance artists by including portraits of his contemporaries among the ancient philosophers. For example, Plato is a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci. Raphael also included a portrait of himself on the far right, looking out at the viewer.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span><em>The School of Athens</em> brilliantly illustrates the Renaissance ideals of order, unity, and symmetry.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Piero della Francesca, <em>Federico de Montefeltro and Battista Sforza</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>State portraits became popular in fifteenth-century Italy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Piero della Francesca (1439–1492) painted a double portrait of Duke Frederico de Montefeltro and his wife Battista Sforza.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The portraits celebrate the power of the aristocratic elite. For example, Federico’s hat and coat are rendered in the red color that had been conventional for portrait busts of Roman emperors.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Michelangelo, <em>Sistine Chapel Ceiling</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The 300 figures in the Sistine Chapel Ceiling represent a stunning fulfillment of the Renaissance goal of combining ancient Classical form with Christian subject matter.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The <em>Creation of Adam</em> panel marks the culmination of a century of Renaissance research into the nature and possibilities of human anatomy. While Adam’s body has the beauty of a Greek god, his face burns with an inner intensity inspired by his closeness to God.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Both the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and St. Peter’s Basilica provide visual symbols of the power of the Renaissance papacy.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE DEBATE ABOUT WOMEN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The beginning of the Renaissance coincided with a “debate about women” (<em>querelle des femmes)</em>.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Humanist scholars and others debated women’s character, nature, and role in society.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_33"/>B.</strong></span><strong>CHRISTINE DE PIZAN (1364–1430), THE FIRST FEMINIST</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Pizan was a prolific writer who became the first woman in European history to earn a living as an author.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Pizan wrote a history of famous women designed to refute “masculine myths” about women. She is now remembered as Europe’s first feminist.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>HUMANISM AND WOMEN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Renaissance humanism represented a real advance for aristocratic women.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Well-to-do girls received a humanistic education similar to boys. For example, young ladies studied the classics, played musical instruments, and corresponded with their families and friends.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CASTIGLIONE AND THE PERFECT COURT LADY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>As mentioned earlier, Castiglione believed the perfect court lady should be attractive, well educated, and able to paint, dance, and play a musical instrument.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Although well educated, Castiglione’s court lady was not expected to actively participate in political, artistic, or literary affairs. Instead, she should be a pleasing and attractive “ornament” for her upper-class husband.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>ISABELLA D’ESTE (1475–1539), THE FIRST LADY OF THE RENAISSANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Isabella d’Este was the most famous Renaissance woman.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>She was born into the ruling family of Ferrara and married the ruler of Mantua.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>She was an art patron whose collection included works by many of the greatest Renaissance artists. Her life illustrates that becoming a patron of the arts was the most socially acceptable role for a well-educated Renaissance woman.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Isabella d’Este also provides an important example of how women often played an important role in smaller Renaissance courts.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>LIMITATIONS ON WOMEN’S LIVES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Humanism only affected a relatively small number of Renaissance women.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_34"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>The vast majority of Renaissance women did not experience any significant loosening in the restraints that traditionally restricted their lives. For example, women were excluded from guilds and denied basic civil rights.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Renaissance women continued to lead highly circumscribed lives. They were expected to participate in the endless labor required to provide food and clothing for their families. In addition, childbearing and child-raising severely restricted their freedom.</p>
