<p class="C851"><strong>Strategies for the Long-Essay Question</strong></p>
<p class="C752">After completing the DBQ, you will yearn for a break to rest your tired writing hand. Unfortunately, there is no break. Instead, you must be resolute and focus on the next and final APEURO challenge: the long-essay question.</p>
<p class="C752">The long-essay section will ask you to examine three questions focusing on the same historical reasoning process. Fortunately, you only have to answer <em>one</em> of the questions. You will have 40 minutes to write your essay.</p>
<p class="C752">Your long essay can earn up to 6 rubric points. Each point is worth 3.5 exam points. So a perfect score of 6 is worth 21 points or 15 percent of your total exam score. It is important to remember that earning 4 of the 6 possible rubric points will keep you on pace to earn an overall score of a 4 or 5 on your APEURO exam.</p>

<p class="C752">The long-essay section will provide you with three questions. Don’t panic! You will be asked to answer only <em>one</em> of the questions.</p>
<p class="C752">The first question focuses primarily on historical developments or processes between 1450 and 1700, the second primarily on historical developments or processes between 1648 and 1914, and the third primarily on historical developments or processes between 1815 and 2001. The three questions will all address the same reasoning processes—comparison, causation, or continuity and change over time.</p>

<p class="C752">Practice is the key to performing well on the long essay. The following sample long essay is designed to illustrate how to use a guided set of six strategies that can be applied to any long-essay question.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>1<span class="C447">.</span>Begin by carefully analyzing the assignment and making a pragmatic choice.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Your first task is to select which one of the three long-essay questions you want to write about. Here are three long-essay questions that test the historical reasoning process of comparison:</p>
<p class="C803"><span class="C641"><strong>•</strong></span>Evaluate the most significant differences between how Italian Renaissance and Northern Renaissance artists and writers viewed human beings and religion.</p>
<p class="C803"><span class="C641">•</span>Evaluate the most significant differences between how Enlightenment and Romantic thinkers viewed human beings, the natural world, and religion.</p>
<p class="C803"><span class="C641">•</span>Evaluate the most significant difference between how Romantic and Realist thinkers viewed politics and diplomacy.</p>
<p class="C752">Begin by taking about five minutes to evaluate the three questions. Above all, make a pragmatic choice. A common mistake many students make is to choose <span id="page_370"/>the question they find the most challenging thinking they could earn more points by tackling a harder task. Avoid this pitfall. Always choose the question that you know the most about.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>2<span class="C447">.</span>The all-important first paragraph (2 points)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Your opening paragraph is very important. Use the first 2–3 sentences to establish the historic context for the topic specified in your prompt. The first two sentences in our sample introductory paragraph provide the “big picture” or historic setting. Then use your next 3–5 sentences to present a clearly defined thesis that establishes your line of reasoning.</p>
<p class="C752">Our “combo” paragraph combines contextualization and the thesis statement. This combination is worth 2 rubric points or 10 exam points! Given this high value, plan carefully. It is better to take a few extra minutes to carefully construct your opening paragraph than to rush and end up with a weak thesis.</p>
<p class="C752">It is important to note that you should not divide this paragraph. Readers expect to see your thesis in the first paragraph. Long-essay readers report that the overwhelming majority of students use a combo approach to begin their essays.</p>
<p class="C752">Here is a clear and fully developed opening combo paragraph for the second question above:</p>
<p class="C752">Evaluate the most significant differences between how Enlightenment and Romantic thinkers viewed human beings, the natural world, and religion.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Essay introduction</strong></p>
<p class="C1036"><em>Isaac Newton was the last and greatest figure of the Scientific Revolution. In 1687 he published</em> Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy<em>, a milestone book proving that gravity governs the motion of all matter on Earth and in outer space. Influenced by Newton, Enlightenment thinkers honored reason as if it were a divine force. They believed that human beings are guided by reason and that the natural world is a vast mechanism whose secrets can be discovered by reason and formulated into natural laws. In contrast, Romantic thinkers protested against the Enlightenment’s excessive reliance on reason. They believed that human beings are driven by powerful and often irrational emotions. The two movements very different views of nature can be seen in their contrasting attitudes towards religion</em>.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>3<span class="C447">.</span>Provide relevant supporting evidence (2 points)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Your opening paragraph established a historic context and a thesis based on a clear line of reasoning. Your next step is to provide at least two examples of specific historic evidence that support your argument that the Enlightenment and Romantic movements offered contrasting views of human beings, the natural world, and religion.</p>
<p class="C752"><span id="page_371"/>Each of the three body paragraphs contains specific historical evidence to support the thesis line of reasoning. For example, the first body paragraph uses the views of Voltaire and Diderot to illustrate the primacy of reason among Enlightenment thinkers. The second body paragraph uses Friedrich’s painting to illustrate the Romantic view of nature. The third body paragraph explains the Deist view of nature and contrasts it with the growing popularity of emotional religious revivals.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Essay body paragraphs</strong></p>
<p class="C838"><em>(1<span class="C520z">)</span>The Enlightenment rested on a strong belief in the ability of reason to understand human nature. Enlightened writers such as Voltaire and Diderot hated ignorance and intolerance. They believed that reason was the alternative to superstition and prejudice. In contrast, Romantics stressed the primacy of the heart over the head. Romantics preferred to rely on intuition and subjective feelings. While the philosophes valued order and natural laws, the Romantics valued spontaneous feelings. Romantic artists depicted states of mind for the first time in Western art. They portrayed insanity, dreams, and nightmares. This emphasis upon states of mind anticipated Freud’s work on the subconscious</em>.</p>
<p class="C838"><em>(2<span class="C520z">)</span>The Scientific Revolution and the work of Newton had a strong influence on how Enlightened thinkers viewed the natural world. The philosophes believed that natural laws regulated both the universe and human society. While the philosophes investigated the natural world, Romantic artists chose to depict the natural world as a mysterious force best viewed with awe. For example, the German artist Caspar David Friedrich captured the essence of the Romantic view of the natural world in his painting, “Wanderer Looking Over a Sea of Fog.” Friedrich’s solitary “wanderer” stands alone on a rocky cliff pondering a landscape shrouded in thick mist</em>.</p>
<p class="C838"><em>(3<span class="C520z">)</span>The Enlightened and Romantic views of human nature and the natural world affected religious thought in very different ways. Enlightened thinkers rejected faith and favored the Deist view that a distant God created the natural world and like a “divine watchmaker” stepped back and let it run according to natural laws. In contrast, Romantics embraced the wonder and mysteries of nature as a way to feel the divine presence. This stress on emotions, inner faith, and religious inspiration can be seen in the nineteenth century religious revivals and the growing popularity of Pietism and Methodism</em>.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>4<span class="C447">.</span>Demonstrate the use of historical reasoning (1 point)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The long-essay rubric awards 1 point for demonstrating the use of historical reasoning to frame or state your argument. Historical reasoning processes include comparison, causation, and continuity and change over time (CCOT). <span id="page_372"/>Our model long-essay uses comparison to structure its argument. Note that body paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 (see above) all use comparison to contrast relevant differences between how Enlightenment and Romantic thinkers viewed human beings, the natural world, and religion.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>5<span class="C447">.</span>Adding a conclusion (Maybe 1 point)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The long-essay rubric does not require a conclusion. However, many experienced readers recommend that you write a conclusion. Here’s why: Students often have a difficult time writing a concise opening paragraph. Fortunately, the rubric awards a thesis point if your thesis is in either the introduction or the conclusion. The process of writing your long essay will crystallize your thoughts, enabling you to write a cogent thesis as part of your conclusion. Here is a sample from our model essay:</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Essay conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="P319"><em>Romanticism dominated European art and literature during the first half of the nineteenth century. The Romantic movement represented a repudiation of the Enlightened view of human nature and the natural world. Romantic authors and artists rejected reason and emphasized emotion. This new emphasis upon feeling and intuition led to the first attempts to probe the unconscious and to a widespread religious revival</em>.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>6<span class="C447">.</span>A complex understanding (1 point)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The complexity point is difficult to earn. Readers award this elusive point to less than 5 percent of all long-essays. Difficult does not mean impossible. Our model essay opens with a sophisticated thesis stating that Enlightenment and Romantic thinkers offered contrasting views of human beings, the natural world, and religion. The essay then continues this line of reasoning by providing detailed comparisons of Enlightenment and Romantic views of these topics. The concluding paragraph unifies the essay’s line of reasoning. Taken together, these components provide a nuanced argument that would earn the complexity point.</p>
