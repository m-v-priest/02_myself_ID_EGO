<p class="C1030">“The painter is lord of all types of people and of all things. If the painter wishes to see beauties that charm him it lies in his power to create them, and if he wishes to see monstrosities that are frightful, buffoonish or ridiculous, or pitiable he can be lord and god thereof. . . . In fact whatever exists in the universe, in essence, in appearance, in the imagination, the painter has first in his mind and then in his hand; and these are of such excellence that they can present a proportioned and harmonious view of the whole, that can be seen simultaneously, at one glance, just as things in nature.”</p>

Most especially was every one of the enemy bent on securing much booty. When a marauding party entered a house, if its master had anything to give he might thereby purchase respite and protection for himself and his family till the next man, who also wanted something, should come along. It was only when everything had been brought forth and there was nothing left to give that the real trouble commenced. Then, what with blows and threats of shooting, stabbing, and hanging, the poor people were so terrified that if they had had anything left they would have brought it forth if it had been buried in the earth or hidden away in a thousand castles. In this frenzied rage the great and splendid city that had stood like a fair princess in the land was now, in its hour of direst need and unutterable distress and woe, given over to the flames and thousands of innocent men, women, and children in the midst of a horrible <span id="page_337"/>din of heartrending shrieks and cries, were tortured and put to death in so cruel and shameful a manner that no words would suffice to describe, nor tears to bewail it.”</p>

It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled. It had a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill smelling dye, and vast piles of buildings full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the steam engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness. It contained several large streets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next.”</p>

<p class="C1030">“Now, woman has always been man’s dependent, if not his slave; the two sexes have never shared the world in equality. And even today woman is heavily handicapped, though her situation is beginning to change. Almost nowhere is her legal status the same as man’s, and frequently it is much to her disadvantage. Even when her rights are legally recognized in the abstract, long-standing custom prevents their full expression in the mores. In the economic sphere men and women can almost be said to make up two castes; other things being equal, the former hold the better jobs, get higher wages, and have more opportunities for success than their new competitors. In industry and politics men have a great many more positions and they monopolize the most important posts.”</p>

<p class="C792"><strong>1<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(C) Leonardo da Vinci was one of the foremost High Renaissance artists. His work was part of the humanist revival of classical learning.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>2<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(B) Da Vinci’s use of direct observation foreshadowed the empirical method of observation employed by Galileo and other pioneers of the scientific revolution.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>3<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(A) Compositional harmony was one of the hallmarks of High Renaissance art. Da Vinci’s reference to “a proportional and harmonious view of the whole” underscores his commitment to symmetry and balance.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>4<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(A) The excerpt describes an event during the Swedish Phase of the Thirty Years’ War. The war began when the Protestant and Catholic states forged rival alliances to defend their interests.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>5<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(D) Answer choices (A), (B), and (C) are all incorrect consequences of the Thirty Years’ War. Answer choice (D) is correct because the war did lead to the establishment of the modern system of diplomatic relations among mutually recognized sovereign states.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>6<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(D) The “frenzied rage” that destroyed Magdeburg provides a tragic example of how the Thirty Years’ War devastated the German economy and decimated its population.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>7<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(B) The Dutch Republic was Europe’s leading commercial power during most of the seventeenth century. The Dutch East Indies Company played a key role in this economic success by displacing the Portuguese and gaining control of the lucrative spice trade in the East Indies.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>8<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(A) The English responded to the Dutch commercial success by enacting the Navigation Act of 1651. The act barred Dutch ships from carrying goods between other countries and England.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong><span id="page_348"/>9<span class="C447">.</span></strong>(C) Religious toleration was one of the key features of the Dutch Republic. It helped create a cosmopolitan society that promoted commerce.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>10<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(C) The Dutch Republic’s commercial success played a key role in the development of a European market economy during the seventeenth century.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>11<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(A) Galileo’s revolutionary discoveries challenged the Church’s long-standing doctrine that God had deliberately placed the Earth at the center of the universe. The two letters reflect the ongoing tension between religious dogma and scientific discoveries.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>12<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(C) French philosophes such as Voltaire championed reason. They were convinced that natural laws regulated the universe.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>13<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(D) Galileo was one of the first scientists to use the telescope for astronomical observations. His discoveries provided irrefutable support for the heliocentric view that the Earth was a planet circling the sun. This represented a direct challenge to traditional Church and classical authorities.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>14<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(D) Cardinal Bellarmine specifically notes that “the Council of Trent prohibits interpreting Scripture against the common consensus of the Holy Fathers.” He would therefore agree with the official decrees of a Church council.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>15<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(B) Napoleon unwittingly sparked a wave of German nationalism that fueled resistance to his rule. People who first welcomed the French as liberators now felt that they were being exploited by foreign invaders. Napoleon thus inadvertently accelerated the cause of German unification in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>16<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(D) Answer choices (A), (B), and (C) are all inaccurate statements. Historians would argue that Napoleon violated one of the French Revolution’s key principles by censoring newspapers, plays, and books.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>17<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(A) During the mid-nineteenth century, writers and artists rejected Romantic themes as overly idealized and artificial. <span id="page_349"/>The excerpt from <em>Hard Times</em> is an example of the new Realist approach to portraying the harsh realities of industrial life.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>18<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(C) Scientific socialists such as Marx and Engels strongly condemned the working and living conditions created by the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>19<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(C) The excerpt provides a particularly vivid description of both the environmental and social impacts of unregulated capitalism.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>20<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(D) Answer choices (A), (B), and (C) are all historically inaccurate. The repressive tsarist government under Nicholas II provides strong support for Figes’ characterization of Russia’s political culture prior to the Bolshevik Revolution.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>21<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(B) Answer choices (A), (C), and (D) are all historically inaccurate statements. Stalin created an oppressive totalitarian state that made extensive use of secret police, purges, and prison camps.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>22<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(B) The Marshall Plan successfully promoted Europe’s economic revival by providing needed financial aid and political leadership.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>23<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(A) The economic revival of Western Europe provided a stark contrast with the stagnation in the Communist bloc countries. This contrast played a key role in the popular unrest that led to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe in 1989.</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>24<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(D) By the end of World War II, European women received the suffrage in every country except Switzerland. This provides strong evidence supporting de Beauvoir’s statement that “the situation is beginning to change.”</p>
<p class="C792"><strong>25<span class="C504">.</span></strong>(D) As more and more women became social activists, they broadened their efforts to include a variety of new issues. West German women played a leading role in the formation of the Green Party.</p>
