<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>EASTERN EUROPE IN 1648</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Holy Roman Empire, the Republic of Poland, and the Ottoman Empire occupied the area from the French border to Russia.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>All three empires were declining. Each lacked a strong central authority and an efficient system of government.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Each of the declining empires contained diverse ethnic and language groups.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Reformation left the Holy Roman Empire religiously divided between Catholics and Protestants.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Thirty Years’ War left the Holy Roman Empire politically divided into 300 independent states.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The empire had an elected emperor who had no imperial army, revenues, or centralized authority.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Led by the Habsburgs and the Hohenzollerns, Austria and Prussia gradually emerged as the leading German states.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>On a map of Europe in 1660, Poland appears to be a large, united country. In reality, the king of Poland was elected by Polish nobles who severely restricted his power.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Poland did have a central legislative body known as a diet. However, action required the unanimous consent of each aristocratic member. Any member could break up or “explode” the diet by objecting to a policy or act.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_110"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Poland’s lack of centralized power created a power vacuum that left it vulnerable to stronger and more aggressive nations.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Suleiman the Magnificent (reigned 1520–1566), the Ottomans threatened Vienna.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In the middle of the seventeenth century, a series of ambitious rulers revitalized the Ottoman Empire. In 1683, a powerful Turkish army once again besieged Vienna.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Austrian forces reinforced by Poles and Germans successfully repelled the Turks. This marked the beginning of a steady decline in Ottoman power.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE REVIVAL OF HABSBURG POWER</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Habsburgs were one of the oldest dynasties in Europe. Beginning in the early 1400s, most of the Holy Roman emperors were Habsburgs.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Habsburg power suffered a series of setbacks following the devastation of the Thirty Years’ War and the extinction of the Habsburg line in Spain.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Despite these defeats, the Habsburg rulers successfully reaffirmed their power over Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary. In addition, the Treaty of Utrecht gave the Habsburgs control of Naples, Sardinia, and Milan in Italy and the Spanish Netherlands (subsequently renamed the Austrian Netherlands).</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>It is important to note that the Habsburg empire embraced a large number of ethnic groups who were unified only by their Catholic faith and their loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CHARLES VI AND THE PRAGMATIC SANCTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Emperor Charles VI (reigned 1711–1740) did not have a male heir.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Determined to insure a safe succession for his daughter, Maria Theresa, Charles drew up a document called the Pragmatic Sanction. It stated that the territories of the Habsburg empire were <span id="page_111"/>indivisible and that Maria Theresa would inherit the throne and all Habsburg lands.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>England and other foreign powers forced Charles to make a number of concessions before agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction. Charles died believing he had guaranteed the peace and integrity of his realm.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE HOHENZOLLERNS OF BRANDENBURG-PRUSSIA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Brandenburg was a small state located between the Oder and Elbe rivers with its center in Berlin.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The ruler of Brandenburg was one of seven princes who elected the Holy Roman emperor.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Hohenzollern family became the hereditary rulers of Brandenburg in 1417.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>In the early seventeenth century, the Hohenzollerns inherited Cleves and some neighboring lands on the Rhine River and the duchy of Prussia on the Baltic coast to the northeast.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>These diverse and geographically separated Hohenzollern possessions had no natural boundaries, few resources, and a population of just 1.5 million people.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FREDERICK WILLIAM, THE GREAT ELECTOR (REIGNED 1640–1688)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Although scattered and weak, the Hohenzollern possessions were the second-largest block of territory in the Holy Roman Empire. Only the Habsburgs could claim more land.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Known as the Great Elector, Frederick William began the process of forging the Hohenzollern territories into a strong power. He recognized that a well-equipped army would protect his territories and enable him to play a role in European balance-of-power politics.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Frederick William demanded and received the loyalty of the Junkers, the German landowners. In exchange, the Junkers received full power over the serfs who labored on their estates.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_112"/>C.</strong></span><strong>FREDERICK WILLIAM I (REIGNED 1713–1740)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Like the Great Elector, Frederick William I was determined to build a powerful army. During his reign, the Prussian military doubled to over 80,000 men. Although Prussia had Europe’s thirteenth-largest population, it boasted the continent’s third- or fourth-largest army.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Under the Hohenzollerns, military priorities and values dominated all aspects of Prussian life. Led by the Junkers, the officer corps became Prussia’s most prestigious class. As noted by one foreign diplomat, “Prussia is not a state that possesses an army, but an army that possesses a state.”</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ISOLATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Russia was geographically isolated from the rest of Europe. Sweden prevented Russia from reaching the Baltic Sea while the Ottoman Empire prevented Russia from reaching the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Russia was culturally isolated from the rest of Europe. The ideas of the Renaissance and Reformation and all the discoveries of the Age of Exploration and the Scientific Revolution scarcely affected Russia.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ROMANOV DYNASTY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Following the death of Ivan the Terrible in 1584, Russia experienced a period of weakness and disorder known as the Time of Troubles.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Hoping to restore order, an assembly of nobles elected Michael Romanov to be the next tsar. The Romanov Dynasty ruled Russia from 1613 to 1917.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MODERNIZING RUSSIA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Peter the Great recognized that Russia had fallen behind Western Europe. Determined to learn from his rivals, Peter visited Holland and England, where he toured shipyards, examined new military equipment, and observed Western customs.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_113"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Peter returned to Moscow vowing to transform Russia into a great power. He began by creating a standing army trained by foreign officers. Peter then built a Russian navy originally trained by foreign officers.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Peter did not limit his changes to military organization and technology. He improved Russian agriculture by introducing the potato, strengthened the Russian economy by importing skilled workers, and liberated Russian women by allowing them to appear in public without veils. In a famous and much resented act, Peter forced nobles to shave off their traditional long beards.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>DEFEATING SWEDEN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Thirty Years’ War left Sweden in control of the Baltic’s entire eastern shore.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1700, Peter ordered his army to end Sweden’s dominance of the Baltic. The Great Northern War between Sweden and Russia lasted from 1700 to 1721.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>After suffering initial defeats at the hands of Sweden’s king Charles XII, Peter ultimately won the war, thus gaining control over warm-water outlets on the Baltic shore.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The defeat contributed to Sweden’s decline as a major European power. At the same time, Russia now became the dominant power on the Baltic Sea and a force in European politics.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>BUILDING ST. PETERSBURG</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Peter the Great began building St. Petersburg in 1703. Named after his patron saint, St. Petersburg would be “a great window for Russia to look out at Europe.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>St. Petersburg quickly became a symbol of Peter the Great’s new and more powerful Russia.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CONTROLLING THE BOYARS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The boyars were the old nobility who supported traditional Russian culture. Comprising about 7 percent of the population, this large noble class posed a threat to Peter’s reform program.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Peter the Great did more than order the boyars to shave off their long beards and wear Western clothing. He also compelled them to construct costly townhouses in St. Petersburg and required every noble to serve in the army or in the civil administration.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_114"/>E.</strong></span><strong>EXPLOITING THE SERFS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Russia’s peasants did not enjoy the benefits of Peter the Great’s reforms. Instead, they were conscripted into Russia’s army and forced to build St. Petersburg.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In central Europe, serfs were bound to the land. In contrast, Russian serfs could be sold apart from the land. This enabled nobles to force serfs to work in mines and factories.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>EVALUATING PETER THE GREAT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Peter the Great provided a model of how an energetic and ruthless autocrat would change a nation. He successfully transformed Russia into a great power that would play an increasingly important role in European history.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Peter the Great’s policies increased the disparities between the nobles and the peasants. Millions of exploited serfs formed an estranged class that did not share in Russian society.</p>
