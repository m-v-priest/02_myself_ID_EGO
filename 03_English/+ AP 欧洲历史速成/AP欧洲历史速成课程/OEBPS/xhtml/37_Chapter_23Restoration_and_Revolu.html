<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE CONGRESS SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>England, Austria, Prussia, and Russia formed a Quadruple Alliance committing them to preserve the conservative order.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The great powers also agreed to hold periodic meetings or congresses to prevent crises from escalating into wider wars.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The effort to achieve consensus on foreign policy issues was known as the Concert of Europe. It marks the first significant experiment in collective security.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>REVOLT AND REPRESSION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Congress of Vienna disappointed liberals and nationalists across Europe. Discontentment led to revolts that tested Metternich and the Concert of Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Uprisings in Spain and Italy</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The repressive policies of the restored Spanish Bourbon King Ferdinand VII provoked demands for a more representative government. Acting with the consent of the other great powers, the French forces intervened, enabling Ferdinand to regain absolute power.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Repressive monarchs in Naples and Sardinia-Piedmont also sparked rebellions. Metternich promptly responded by sending in Austrian forces who defeated the rebels.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Repression in Germany</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Young Germans continued to hope for liberal reforms and a united Germany. Disillusioned by the Congress of Vienna, they formed student associations to discuss their concerns.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_198"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>Alarmed by these student activists, Metternich persuaded the major German states to issue the Carlsbad Decrees. The decrees dissolved the student associations, censored books and newspapers, and used secret police to harass dissidents.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Decembrist Revolt in Russia</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>When Tsar Alexander I died in December 1825, a group of army officers rebelled, calling for constitutional reform.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Alexander’s successor, Nicholas I (reigned 1825–1855) ruthlessly suppressed the Decembrists.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Under Nicholas I’s oppressive regime, Russia became Europe’s most powerful reactionary stronghold.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Nicholas I turned Russia into a police state. The tsar was a ruthless autocrat who forbade representative assemblies, monitored university curricula, and censored all dissenting viewpoints.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE REFORM BILL OF 1832</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The House of Commons was less representative of the British people than at any time in its 500-year history.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Many boroughs (electoral districts) were sparsely populated, and a few had no people at all. Meanwhile, new industrial cities such as Manchester had no representatives.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>After a decade of pressure from factory owners and merchants, Parliament passed the Reform Bill of 1832. It created a number of new districts representing heavily urban areas. It also doubled the number of voters to include most middle-class men. And finally, the Reform Bill of 1832 resulted in the supremacy of the House of Commons over the House of Lords.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Under the Reform Bill of 1832, only about one in five adult males could vote. Workers, women, and the poor were all disenfranchised.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE REPEAL OF THE CORN LAWS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Corn Laws placed a high tariff on imported corn, wheat, and other grains. The tariff benefited large landowners by providing them with a protected market for their crops.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_199"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Prominent industrialists formed the Anti-Corn Law League. They advocated a free-trade policy that would lower the price of food and increase the profits of industry.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Wealthy landowners stubbornly resisted all reform proposals. However, the Irish potato famine dramatically strengthened support for cheaper imported grains.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Parliament finally voted to repeal the Corn Laws in 1846. This marked a victory for Britain’s urban population and for the proponents of free trade.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE CHARTIST MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Britain’s disenfranchised workers demanded more sweeping reforms.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1838, working-class leaders drew up a People’s Charter that demanded universal manhood suffrage, a secret ballot, equal electoral districts, and the abolition of property requirements for membership in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Despite widespread public support, Parliament adamantly refused to consider the Chartists’ proposals. It is important to note that most of the Chartist reforms would be ultimately adopted.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The British people saw that reform was possible without a violent revolution.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>England experienced much less internal unrest than the other countries in Europe.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1830</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1824, Charles X (reigned 1824–1830) succeeded his brother, Louis XVIII. A dedicated reactionary, Charles X vigorously opposed republicanism, liberalism, and constitutionalism.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Charles X’s reactionary policies infuriated both his liberal and working-class opponents.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Discontent with Charles X’s arbitrary policies ignited three days of rioting in July 1830. Eugène Delacroix captured the spirit of the uprising in his famous painting, <em>Liberty Leading the People</em>.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_200"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>Delacroix’s tribute to liberty portrayed a unified people dedicated to overthrowing tyranny. The unity proved to be brief. While the workers wanted a republic, the bourgeoisie wanted a constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The bourgeoisie prevailed. With their support, Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, became “king of the French.” Louis Philippe prided himself on being a “citizen king” who supported France’s business interests.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>REVOLUTION IN BELGIUM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The July Revolution in France helped spark discontent in Belgium.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Congress of Vienna united the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) with Holland to form a single kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Catholic Belgium and Protestant Holland had very little in common. In 1830, riots in Belgium quickly turned into a widespread demand for independence.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Both Great Britain and France opposed intervention. In 1830, the great powers recognized Belgium as a neutral state.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ITALIAN NATIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Austria dominated northern Italy.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Italian nationalists formed a secret society called the Carbonari (“charcoal burners”). The Carbonari hoped to drive out the Austrians and unify Italy.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Inspired by the events in France and Belgium, the Carbonari rebelled. However, Metternich promptly sent in Austrian troops to restore order.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Carbonari’s failure left Giuseppe Mazzini as Italy’s foremost nationalist leader.</p>

</table>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Conservative leaders steadfastly refused to respond to the problems and social tensions created by industrialization and urbanization.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_201"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Working-class radicals and middle-class liberals were convinced that the repressive Metternich system had outlived its usefulness.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Nationalists in Italy and Germany yearned for unification. At the same time, national minorities in the Austrian Empire demanded independence.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Widespread crop failures, rising prices of food, and growing unemployment helped fuel popular unrest and calls for change.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>REVOLUTION IN FRANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Affluent bourgeoisie dominated France during the reign of Louis Philippe (reigned 1830–1848). A leading minister rejected demands for extending the franchise to the working class by proclaiming, “Enrich yourself and you will have the vote.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Unable to withstand public pressure, Louis Philippe’s government collapsed in February 1848.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>As tension and unrest gripped Paris, liberals, socialists, and Bonapartists all vied for power.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Following a bloody confrontation between workers and the capitalist-backed government, French voters overwhelmingly elected Louis Napoleon as president of the Second French Republic. The nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, Louis promised to restore order at home and glory abroad.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>DEFEAT IN ITALY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Giuseppe Mazzini, the “Young Italy” movement sought to establish a liberal republic embracing all Italy.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Austrians once again proved to be too strong while the Italians once again proved to be too divided.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>HOPE AND FAILURE IN GERMANY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>A growing number of German nationalists hoped for a more liberal German state.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1834, all the major German states except Austria formed the Zollverein, an economic union that eliminated internal tariffs. The Zollverein facilitated commerce and set a precedent for greater union.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_202"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Riots broke out in Berlin in 1848. Frederick William IV (reigned 1840–1861) responded by issuing a series of reforms, including calling a Prussian assembly to draft a new constitution.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Meanwhile, another assembly met in Frankfurt to draft a constitution for all Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The hopes of German reformers were soon crushed. Supported by the army, Frederick William dissolved the Prussian assembly. He then rejected the Frankfurt assembly’s plan for a constitutional monarchy declaring that he would refuse to “pick up a crown from the gutter.”</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>The failure of the German reform movement had fateful consequences for Germany and the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>REVOLUTIONS IN THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Austria was a huge dynastic state in which a dominant German-speaking nation ruled a large number of subject nationalities and ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Revolutionary fervor quickly spread from Paris to Vienna. As tensions mounted, Metternich resigned and fled to England.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>An Austrian constituent assembly abolished the robot, or forced labor, thus removing a major source of peasant discontent.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Revolution quickly spread from Vienna to Hungary, where Louis Kossuth demanded self-government.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Despite initial setbacks, the Austrian government regained control. Only Hungary remained defiant. The new Austrian emperor, Francis Joseph (reigned 1848–1916), accepted the offer of Tsar Nicholas I to help defeat the Hungarians. A joint invasion by Russian and Austrian forces crushed Hungarian resistance.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>KEY POINTS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The revolutions of 1848 failed because of internal divisions, a lack of popular support outside the cities, and the continued strength of conservative forces.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Although temporarily frustrated, the basic liberal principle of government by consent continued to gain influence as the middle class grew in size, wealth, and influence.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_203"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Peaceful reforms enabled England to avoid violent revolts.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Repressive policies stifled reform in Russia.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The ideas of nationalism and national unification continued to grow and gain support.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>The era’s idealistic romantic spirit now yielded to a new age of political realism.</p>
