Mercantilism gave the new monarchies a leading role in promoting commercial development and the acquisition of New World colonies.</p>
<p class="C460"><strong>8<span class="C447">.</span>COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION—</strong>Innovations in banking and finance that promoted the growth of urban financial centers and a money economy.</p>
