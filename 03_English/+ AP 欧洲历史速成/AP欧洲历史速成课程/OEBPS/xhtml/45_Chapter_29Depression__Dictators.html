<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Widespread famine, a deteriorating economy, and increasing unrest all plagued Russia following the civil war.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Lenin pragmatically realized that he needed to make a tactical retreat. In March 1921, he launched the New Economic Policy. It called for a temporary compromise with capitalism. Small businesses were denationalized, and peasants were allowed to establish free markets in agricultural products. The Communist Party still maintained control of large industries such as oil and steel.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The New Economic Policy successfully revived the Russian economy. By 1928, the country’s farms and factories produced as much as they had before World War I.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>JOSEPH STALIN VERSUS LEON TROTSKY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Lenin’s death in 1924 created a power struggle between Trotsky and Stalin.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>As a charismatic leader since 1905, Trotsky was second only to Lenin in fame. Trotsky believed that Russia should support communist revolutions around the world.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In contrast, Stalin was a quiet man who preferred to work behind the scenes. As general secretary of the Communist Party, Stalin placed his supporters in key positions. Stalin argued that communism should first gain a firm hold in Russia before supporting a global revolution.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Stalin proved to be cunning and ruthless. He successfully expelled Trotsky from the Communist Party. By 1927, Stalin stood alone as the Soviet Union’s undisputed leader.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_270"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE FIVE-YEAR PLANS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1928, Stalin launched the first of a series of five-year plans designed to transform the Soviet Union’s economic and social structure. The plans had the following goals:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>End the New Economic Policy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Create a socialist command economy in which the government makes all economic decisions.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Promote the rapid development of heavy industries.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Collectivize agriculture.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Stalin’s commitment to a program of massive, large-scale industrialism produced results. By 1940, the Soviet Union was a major industrial power, trailing only the United States and Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Stalin’s campaign to collectivize agriculture was less successful. Conservative Russian peasants opposed surrendering their land and joining a collective farm. Stalin denounced resisting peasants as <em>kulaks</em> and ordered party officials to “liquidate them as a class.” <em>Kulaks</em> and other peasants were executed, starved, and deported to forced-labor camps.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE GREAT TERROR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Stalin was a totalitarian dictator who was more powerful than the most autocratic tsar.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>During the mid-1930s, Stalin launched a program of state-sponsored terror that began with show trials to eliminate Old Bolsheviks. The Great Terror expanded to include intellectuals, army officers, party members, and ordinary citizens.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Stalin’s “politics of fear” included the use of secret police and purges of political rivals. At least 8 million people were arrested. Millions of innocent people died in forced-labor camps called gulags.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>POSTWAR ITALY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Italy had entered World War I in hopes of winning mandates in East Africa and Austrian territory along the Adriatic Sea. When <span id="page_272"/>the Treaty of Versailles rejected these claims, embittered Italian nationalists felt betrayed.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Italy faced a severe economic crisis that included soaring inflation, rising unemployment, and a massive national debt.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Italy’s upper and middle classes feared that the economic crisis and growing labor unrest might lead to a communist revolt, as had just happened in Russia.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE RISE OF BENITO MUSSOLINI</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Growing numbers of Italians demanded action and waited impatiently for a strong leader.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Mussolini used Italy’s political power vacuum to seize power. As the leader of the Fascist Party, he boldly promised to revive Italy’s economy and rebuild its armed forces.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1922, Mussolini called upon his followers to march on Rome. Although the government could have stopped Mussolini with a show of force, King Victor Emmanuel III gave in and named Mussolini prime minister.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE FASCIST STATE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Mussolini quickly consolidated his power and organized a Fascist state.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Mussolini outlawed all political parties except the Fascists.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Mussolini’s propaganda encouraged Italians to accept his leadership without question. Slogans such as “Mussolini Is Always Right” covered billboards across Italy.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE CORPORATE ECONOMY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Mussolini believed that capitalists and workers must be forced to cooperate for the good of the state.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>He organized 22 state corporations to run all parts of the Italian economy. Each corporation included employers, employees, and government arbitrators.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The corporations outlawed strikes and set wages and prices.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>It is important to note that Mussolini’s corporate state combined private ownership with state control over economic decisions.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>REASONS WHY THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC FAILED</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Many Germans refused to believe that their army had been defeated in battle. They believed instead that the German army had been betrayed by socialist and liberal politicians associated with the new Weimar Republic.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Versailles Treaty outraged German nationalists who resented the war-guilt clause and the loss of territory to Poland. Constant nationalist agitation undermined support for the Weimar Republic.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Conservatives wanted a strong leader who would restore order and reduce the power of labor unions.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Runaway inflation during the early 1920s destroyed middle-class savings, thus eroding confidence in the government.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The Great Depression had a particularly devastating impact on Germany. Millions of workers lost faith in the Weimar Republic.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Article 48 of the German constitution helped to undermine the republican government by allowing the president to rule by decree in cases of national emergency.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_274"/>B.</strong></span><strong>REASONS WHY ADOLF HITLER ROSE TO POWER</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The weakness of the Weimar Republic helped prepare the public for a bold leader who would restore German pride.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Hitler concluded that he would not attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic by revolutionary means. Instead, he would use the electoral process to legally gain power.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Hitler was a spellbinding demagogue who denounced the Weimar Republic and the Versailles Treaty. He skillfully used modern propaganda techniques to convince the German people to follow his leadership.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Hitler offered the German people an ideology that exploited their fears. The Nazi program included the following key points:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Nationalism: German national honor would be avenged by regaining the lands taken by the Versailles Treaty.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Master race: the Germans were a master race who needed land in eastern Europe and Russia.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Anti-Semitism: Jews were an inferior race responsible for many of Germany’s problems.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Anticommunism: Marxists were responsible for fomenting labor unrest. Much of Hitler’s anti-Semitism focused on alleged Jewish responsibility for the rise of communism.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>The führer: Parliamentary government produced weak, vacillating politicians. Hitler believed that Germany required an absolute leader (or führer) who would embody the national will.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE NAZI TOTALITARIAN STATE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Hitler ruthlessly transformed Germany into a totalitarian state. A series of laws banned all political parties except the Nazis. A special secret police force called the Gestapo used sweeping powers to arbitrarily arrest anyone who opposed Nazi rule.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The government supervised both labor and business. New laws banned strikes and dissolved independent labor unions.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>A ministry of culture supervised the media and shaped public opinion. Special films such as <em>Triumph of the Will</em> glorified Hitler’s leadership.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>It is interesting to note that the Nazi party’s ideal German woman was a mother, wife, and homemaker.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_275"/>D.</strong></span><strong>ANTI-SEMITISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Although Jews comprised less than 1 percent of Germany’s population, Hitler blamed them for Germany’s problems.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1933, the Nazis passed laws forbidding Jews to hold public office. Two years later, the Nuremberg Laws deprived Jews of German citizenship and required them to wear a yellow Star of David as identification.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Nazi violence against Jews steadily mounted. On November 9 and 10, 1938, the Nazis organized a “spontaneous” campaign of mob violence known as the <em>Kristallnacht</em>, or “Crystal Night,” or “The Night of Broken Glass.”</p>

<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Although the League condemned Italy, its members did nothing. The British and French hoped that appeasing Mussolini would maintain the peace.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>REASONS WHY THE DEMOCRACIES FAILED TO ACT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Great Depression forced the United States, Great Britain, and France to focus on domestic issues.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The horrific loss of life in World War I created a deep desire for peace.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>American isolationists believed that U.S. involvement in World War I had been a mistake. They wanted to avoid becoming entangled in European affairs.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_276"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>The democracies repeatedly underestimated Hitler’s thirst for power and conquest.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Spain was a deeply divided country. Between 1931 and 1936, a democratically elected government tried to cope with the Great Depression. Led by General Francisco Franco, army leaders supported by the clergy and aristocracy favored a fascist-style government.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Spanish Civil War began in 1936 when Nationalist forces led by Franco rebelled against the Republic.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The civil war escalated into an international ideological war when Hitler and Mussolini sent men and materials to support the Nationalists. The Russians countered by supporting the Republican, or Loyalist, side.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>During the war, a squadron of German planes bombed the defenseless village of Guernica, killing hundreds of men, women, and children. Pablo Picasso painted <em>Guernica</em> to protest this atrocity.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Republican resistance finally collapsed in 1939. Franco then established an authoritarian regime that remained in power until his death in 1975. It is important to note that Spain was officially neutral during World War II.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE MUNICH CONFERENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1938, Hitler successfully annexed Austria into Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Hitler’s campaign of German expansion focused next on a mountainous region of western Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland. This heavily fortified strategic region contained 3 million German-speaking people.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Hitler, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, Mussolini, and French Premier Édouard Daladier held an emergency conference in Munich to negotiate Hitler’s demand that Czechoslovakia give up the Sudetenland.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Chamberlain believed he could preserve the peace by appeasing Hitler and giving in to his demands.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The Munich Conference marked a turning point in European history. Filled with confidence, Hitler now made plans to attack Poland.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_277"/>6<span class="C504">.</span>The Munich Conference quickly became a symbol of surrender. Following World War II, democratic leaders vowed they would never again appease a ruthless dictator.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union stunned the world by announcing a 10-year nonaggression pact. In addition, they secretly agreed to divide Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>On September 1, 1939, German forces attacked Poland. Two days later, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Germany’s blitzkrieg or “lightning war” combined fast-moving armor and air power to overwhelm Poland.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>HITLER’S EMPIRE IN EUROPE, 1940–1942</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In the spring of 1940, Hitler unleashed a second blitzkrieg that overwhelmed Scandinavia, Belgium, and France. Only Great Britain remained unconquered.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Winston Churchill, the outnumbered British refused to surrender. Their fate rested on the skill and valor of the Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter pilots. In daily air battles beginning in July 1940, the RAF pilots proved more than equal to the challenge. By the end of 1940, Hitler knew that he could neither defeat the RAF nor break the spirit of the British people.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Frustrated by his defeat in the Battle of Britain, Hitler broke his pact with Stalin and, like Napoleon 150 years before, unleashed a massive invasion of Russia. By October 1941, German armies surrounded Leningrad and besieged Moscow.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Hitler now ruled a vast European empire stretching from the English Channel to Moscow.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE HOLOCAUST</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Nazi nightmare did not stop on the battlefields of Europe. Hitler ordered the systematic killing of Jews and other allegedly inferior peoples. This horrible destruction of life is known as the Holocaust.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_278"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>The following factors contributed to the Holocaust:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Jews were a small and vulnerable minority.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Hitler’s propaganda convinced Germans that Jews were an inferior race that should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Hitler’s secret police successfully stifled dissent.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The Nazis successfully secured collaborators in occupied territories.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Nazi Holocaust claimed the lives of over 6 million Poles, Russians, Czechs, and other civilians. Of these, an estimated 5.7 million were European Jews murdered in death camps.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>JAPAN’S EMPIRE IN ASIA, 1941–1942</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The dramatic events in Europe overshadowed the changes occurring in Asia. In July 1941, Japanese forces overran French Indochina. President Roosevelt retaliated by ordering a total embargo of all trade with Japan.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor. Within two hours, the Japanese sank or damaged 18 ships and killed 2,403 Americans.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor stunned the American people. An angry and now united nation entered World War II determined to crush Japan and Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>But reversing the Japanese advance would take time. By May 1942, Japanese forces conquered a vast Pacific empire they called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE GRAND ALLIANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Outraged Americans wanted to first avenge Pearl Harbor. However, President Roosevelt recognized that Hitler posed a greater threat than Japan. If Hitler succeeded in defeating both the Soviet Union and Great Britain, he could transform Europe into an unconquerable fortress. Roosevelt and Churchill therefore agreed upon a military strategy to defeat Hitler first.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Big Three referred to Roosevelt, Churchill, and the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>At a November 1943 meeting in Tehran, Iran, the Big Three reaffirmed their demand for the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_279"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>The Big Three held their second and final meeting at Yalta in February 1945. Churchill and Roosevelt agreed to a temporary division of Germany. In return Stalin agreed to join the war against Japan three months after the Nazis surrendered. Stalin also agreed that Poland should have a representative government based on free elections.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR IN EUROPE, 1942–1945</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In the spring of 1942, German forces hoped to destroy the city of Stalingrad and then capture Soviet oil fields in the nearby Caucasus. After months of desperate fighting, the decimated German forces surrendered. Up and down an 1,800-mile front, Soviet tanks and artillery forced Hitler’s armies to retreat.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Meanwhile, the United States and Great Britain liberated North Africa and successfully invaded Italy.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>On June 6, 1944, American, British, and Canadian forces under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower forced their way onto the beaches of Normandy, France.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Hitler now faced the German nightmare of a war on two fronts. The once invincible German empire steadily shrank as the Soviets invaded from the east and the Allies invaded from the west. Trapped in a vise, Hitler committed suicide and Germany surrendered.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>G.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR IN ASIA, 1942–1945</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The United States successfully halted the Japanese advance with a decisive victory in the Battle of Midway in June 1942.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>American industry soon produced vast numbers of ships and warplanes. In June 1943, American forces began an “island hopping” campaign that steadily rolled back the Japanese Pacific empire.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>By 1945, American forces reclaimed much of the Pacific including the Philippines. However, American commanders warned that an invasion of the Japanese home islands might cost a million American casualties and claim over 10 million Japanese lives.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>H.</strong></span><strong>THE ATOMIC BOMB</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Two weeks later, President Truman learned that the United States had developed a fearsome new weapon, the atomic bomb.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_280"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>On July 26, 1945, Truman issued the Potsdam Declaration calling upon Japan to surrender unconditionally or suffer “the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland.” The Japanese government ignored the warning as “unworthy of public notice.”</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>President Truman authorized the use of the atomic bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. First and foremost, Truman wanted to avoid a bloody invasion of Japan by shocking the Japanese government into an immediate surrender. Modern historians believe that Truman also wanted to convince Stalin to be more cooperative in postwar plans.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The atomic bomb destroyed both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Aghast at the horrible loss of life, Emperor Hirohito told his war council, “I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer.” Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945. However, hopes for a new spirit of cooperation vanished as Europe entered a new and perilous era known as the Cold War.</p>
