<p class="C851"><strong>Seven Keys for Success on the AP® European History Exam</strong></p>
<p class="C939">AP® European History textbooks are very thick and contain thousands of names, dates, places, and events. If all of these facts had an equal chance of appearing on your Advanced Placement® European History (APEURO) exam, studying would be a nightmare. Where would you begin? What would you emphasize? Is there any information you can safely omit? Or must you study everything?</p>
<p class="C939">Fortunately, preparing for the APEURO exam does not have to be a nightmare. By studying efficiently and strategically, you can score a 4 or a 5 on the exam. This book will help you understand and use the following seven keys for success:</p>

</table>
<p class="C939">Many students believe they must make close to a perfect score to receive a 5. Nothing could be further from the truth. Each APEURO exam contains a total of 140 points—55 from the multiple-choice and 85 from the free-response questions. Here is the probable score range for the APEURO Exam:</p>

<p class="C939">This chart is not a misprint. As is clearly shown, you can achieve a score of 5 by correctly answering just 77 percent of the questions, a 4 by correctly answering just 65 percent of the questions, and a 3 by correctly answering just 52 percent of the questions!</p>

<p class="C939">Each of these nine chronological time periods accounts for 10–15 percent of the points on your exam. No AP® European History exam question will require students to know historical content that falls outside of these chronological periods. The 29 chapters in our Crash Course Chronological Review are designed to provide you with the key events, trends, and ideas from these nine periods.</p>

<p class="C939">Many students believe that members of the APEURO exam development committee have the freedom to write any question they wish. This widespread belief is not true. APEURO test writers follow a framework devoted to the following seven themes:</p>
<p class="C637"><span class="C641">•</span><strong>Theme 1:</strong> Interaction of Europe and the World (INT)</p>
<p class="C637"><span class="C641">•</span><strong>Theme 2:</strong> Economic and Commercial Developments (ECD)</p>
<p class="C637"><span class="C641">•</span><strong>Theme 3:</strong> Cultural and Intellectual Developments (CID)</p>
<p class="C637"><span class="C641">•</span><strong>Theme 4:</strong> States and Other Institutions of Power (SOP)</p>
<p class="C637"><span class="C641">•</span><strong>Theme 5:</strong> Social Organization and Development (SCD)</p>
<p class="C637"><span class="C641">•</span><strong>Theme 6:</strong> National and European Identity (NEI)</p>
<p class="C637"><span class="C641">•</span><strong>Theme 7:</strong> Technological and Scientific Innovation (TSI)</p>
<p class="C939"><span id="page_5"/>These seven themes explain why there are so many questions on key intellectual figures, major artistic movements, diplomatic agreements, and economic policies. They also explain why it is a waste of time to study battles, generals, and specific dates.</p>

</table>
<p class="C939">Your APEURO Exam will include four very different question formats. Here are the key facts about each of these formats:</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>You will be asked to answer 55 multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>The 55 questions will be grouped into sets containing between 2 and 4 questions. Each set of questions will be based upon a stimulus prompt. The prompts will be a brief source that could be a reading passage, a chart or graph, an image, or a map.</p>
<p class="C636">3<span class="C447">.</span>Each of the 55 questions will be worth 1 point for a total of 55 points. The multiple-choice questions will count for 40 percent of your total score.</p>
<p class="C636">4<span class="C447">.</span>You will be given 55 minutes to complete the multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p class="C636">5<span class="C447">.</span>See <a href="54_Chapter_35Strategies_for_the_Mul.html#page_329">Chapter 35</a> for detailed strategies for answering the multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p class="C636">6<span class="C447">.</span>See <a href="55_Chapter_36Practice_Multiple_Choi.html#page_335">Chapter 36</a> for sample realistic multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>You will be asked to answer 3 short-answer questions.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>The first short-answer question will feature a secondary source passage. The second short-answer question will feature a primary source. The final two short-answer questions will ask you to compare significant historical trends, patterns, and movements. You will only have to answer one of these two questions. It is important to note that these two questions will not contain a primary or secondary source.</p>
<p class="C636">3<span class="C447">.</span>Each short-answer question will include three very specific sub-points. Your answers to these sub-points do <strong><em>not</em></strong> require a thesis. Concentrate on writing concise statements that include specific historic examples. Use complete sentences; an outline or list of bulleted points is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="C636">4<span class="C447">.</span>Each sub-point is worth 3.1 points. As a result, a full short-answer question is worth 9.3 points. Taken together, the three short-answer questions are worth a total of 28 points, or 20 percent of your total exam score.</p>
<p class="C636">5<span class="C447">.</span>You will be given 40 minutes to complete three short-answer questions.</p>
<p class="C636">6<span class="C447">.</span>See <a href="56_Chapter_37Strategies_for_the_Sho.html#page_351">Chapter 37</a> for detailed strategies for answering the short-answer questions.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_6"/>C.</strong></span><strong>DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTION (DBQ)</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>The DBQ is an essay question that requires you to interpret and analyze 7 brief primary source documents. The documents typically include excerpts from diaries, speeches, letters, reports, and official decrees. In addition, DBQs often include at least one graph, chart, map, political cartoon, or work of art.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>Your DBQ will be scored on a scale that includes 7 specific points. Each one is worth 5 points. Taken together, the DBQ is worth a maximum of 35 points or 25 percent of your total score.</p>
<p class="C636">3<span class="C447">.</span>See <a href="57_Chapter_38Strategies_for_the_Doc.html#page_357">Chapter 38</a> for detailed strategies for answering the document-based essay question.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>LONG-ESSAY QUESTION</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>You will be given three long-essay questions. Although the three questions will be taken from different time periods, they will be related by a common theme and historical thinking skill. You will be asked to select and write about just one of the three long-essay questions.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>Your essay will be scored on a scale that includes 6 specific points. Each one is worth 3.5 points. Taken together the long-essay question is worth 21 points or 15 percent of your total exam score.</p>
<p class="C636">3<span class="C447">.</span>See <a href="58_Chapter_39Strategies_for_the_Lon.html#page_367">Chapter 39</a> for detailed strategies for answering the long-essay question.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>TIMING ON THE DBQ AND LONG ESSAY</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>You will be given 100 minutes to complete the essay portion of your exam.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>The College Board recommends that you devote 15 minutes to reading the DBQ documents, 45 minutes to writing the DBQ essay, and 40 minutes to writing the long essay.</p>
<p class="C636">3<span class="C447">.</span>It is important to note that these times are just recommendations. It is up to you to determine how to best allocate your time. For example, you could choose to spend 65 minutes on your DBQ and 35 minutes on your long essay.</p>

<p class="C939">The APEURO course stresses the understanding and use of three key historical reasoning processes. It is crucial that you understand the meaning of each skill and the role it plays on the exam.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_7"/>A.</strong></span><strong>HISTORICAL CAUSATION</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>This skill involves the ability to identify and evaluate the long- and short-term causes and consequences of a historical event, development, or process.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the multiple-choice questions, short-essay questions and long-essay questions.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>PATTERNS OF CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>This skill involves the ability to recognize, analyze, and evaluate the dynamics of historical continuity and change over periods of time of varying lengths. It also involves the ability to connect these patterns to larger historical processes or themes.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the short-essay and long-essay questions.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>COMPARISON</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>This skill involves the ability to identify, compare, and evaluate multiple perspectives on a given historical event, development, or process.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the multiple-choice questions and long-essay questions.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CONTEXTUALIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>This skill involves the ability to connect historical events and processes to specific circumstances of time and place as well as to broader regional, national, and global processes occurring at the same time.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the multiple-choice questions. It also generates a specific point in the DBQ rubric.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>HISTORICAL ARGUMENTATION</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>This skill involves the ability to create an argument and support it using relevant historical ideas.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in both the DBQ and the long-essay questions. The rubrics in both of these questions award points for developing and supporting a defensible thesis.</p>
<p class="C622"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>ANALYZING EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>This skill involves the ability to analyze features of historical evidence such as audience, purpose, point of view, and historical context.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the DBQ. The DBQ rubric awards 2 points for analyzing evidence presented in the documents.</p>
<p class="C622"><span id="page_8"/><span class="C467"><strong>G.</strong></span><strong>INTERPRETATION</strong></p>
<p class="C636">1<span class="C447">.</span>This skill involves the ability to describe, analyze, and evaluate the different ways historians interpret the past.</p>
<p class="C636">2<span class="C447">.</span>This skill plays a significant role in the short-essay questions.</p>
