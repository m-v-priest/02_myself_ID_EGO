<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In the early 1700s, peasants living in village communities farmed much of the land in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Peasant farmers used an open-field system that included these characteristics:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Animals grazed on the common or open lands.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Villagers divided the remaining land into long, narrow strips. Fences and hedges did not divide this open land.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Peasants traditionally used a two- or three-field system of crop rotation. This system was intended to restore exhausted soil. In practice, it meant that one-third to one-half of the land was allowed to lie fallow on any given year<em/>.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>INNOVATIONS IN THE LOW COUNTRIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Reasons for Low Country leadership in farming</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Low Countries were the most densely populated region in Europe. Dutch farmers were thus forced to seek maximum yields from their lands.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Low Countries contained a growing urban population that created demand for farm products.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>New innovations in the Low Countries</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Enclosed fields.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Continuous crop rotation.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Use of manure as fertilizer.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_142"/><span class="C520">iv.</span>Planting of a variety of crops.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>Use of drainage to reclaim marshes.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ENGLISH AGRICULTURE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Agricultural innovators</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Charles “Turnip” Townshend advocated continuous crop rotation using turnips, wheat, barley, and clover.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Jethro Tull invented a seed drill that allowed for sowing crops in a straight row.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Robert Bakewell pioneered selective breeding of livestock.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The enclosure movement</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>English landowners consolidated previously scattered pasturelands into compact fields enclosed by fences and hedges.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The new enclosed farmland enabled landowners to rapidly implement agricultural innovations. This encouraged the development of market-oriented agricultural production.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The enclosure movement forced many poor rural people to move to cities and work in factories.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Periodic crop failures caused widespread famine.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Epidemic diseases such as bubonic plague decimated Europe’s population.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_143"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Frequent wars destroyed crops and spread contagious diseases. For example, the Thirty Years’ War reduced the population of the German states by at least one-third.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FACTORS PROMOTING POPULATION GROWTH</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The agricultural revolution produced a more abundant food supply.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The potato became a key food staple during the eighteenth century. A single acre of potatoes could feed a family for a year.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Advances in transportation reduced the impact of local crop failures.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Eighteenth-century wars were fought by professional armies with specific geographic and economic objectives. As a result, eighteenth-century wars were less destructive than the seventeenth-century religious wars.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Although still in its embryonic stage, medical care did begin to improve. For example, Edward Jenner’s inoculation reduced deaths caused by smallpox.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Commercial capitalism led to increased prosperity and thus the ability to afford more children.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>Powerful monarchs suppressed civil wars, thereby allowing population to increase.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>POPULATION STATISTICS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Europe’s population increased from 120 million in 1700 to 190 million in 1800.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The population of England rose from 6 million in 1750 to more than 10 million in 1800.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The population of France increased from 18 million in 1715 to 26 million in 1789.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The population of Spain increased from 7.6 million in 1700 to 10.5 million in 1800.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Most young married European couples lived in nuclear families. Large multigenerational households were not the norm.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Most couples postponed marriage until they were in their mid- to late twenties.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Couples delayed marriage in order to acquire land or learn a trade.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>A combination of parental authority and strict laws exercised tight control over marriage.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>PATTERNS OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY AFTER 1750</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The growth of the cottage industry increased income and helped young people become financially independent.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>As income rose, arranged marriages declined.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Increased mobility reduced parental and village controls.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Young peasant women increasingly left home to work as domestic servants.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CHILD REARING</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Because of the high mortality rate among infants, parents were reluctant to become emotionally attached to their children.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Jean-Jacques Rousseau (see <a href="27_Chapter_15The_Enlightenment.html#page_125">Chapter 15</a>) encouraged parents to provide a warm and nurturing environment for their children.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Upper-middle-class parents began to place a greater emphasis on child rearing.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>INCREASED LIFE EXPECTANCY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the eighteenth century, the life spans of Europeans increased from 25 to 35 years.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>New foods, such as the potato, combined with better farming techniques improved the diet of the poor.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Improved sanitation and the beginning of the science of immunology reduced death rates. Edward Jenner performed the first smallpox vaccination in 1796. The conquest of smallpox was the greatest medical triumph of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, between 100,000 and 200,000 people were officially tried for witchcraft.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Between 40,000 and 60,000 people were executed for witchcraft.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Elderly, widowed women were the most likely to be accused of witchcraft.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>REASONS FOR THE GROWTH OF EUROPEAN WITCH HUNTS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Religious reformers stressed the great powers of the Devil. The Devil’s diabolical activities reinforced the widespread belief in witchcraft.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Women were believed to be weak and thus susceptible to the Devil’s temptations.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Religious wars and economic uncertainty caused great social and economic stress. Older, widowed women usually lacked power and thus became convenient scapegoats.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>REASONS FOR THE DECLINE OF WITCHCRAFT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Religious wars finally came to an end, thus restoring social stability.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Protestants emphasized the concept of a supreme God, thus making the Devil seem less threatening.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment emphasized reason and uniform laws of nature. Support for superstition and witchcraft declined as educated Europeans turned to rational explanations of natural events.</p>
