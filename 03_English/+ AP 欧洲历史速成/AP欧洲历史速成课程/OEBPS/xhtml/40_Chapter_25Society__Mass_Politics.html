<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE “BELLE ÉPOQUE”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Following the horrors of World War I, nostalgic Europeans would remember the period between 1880 and 1914 as the “Belle Époque” or “Beautiful Period.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>During this time, Europeans enjoyed a period of unprecedented optimism based upon regional peace, economic prosperity, and technological progress.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE UPPER CLASS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Just 1 to 2 percent of the European population belonged to the upper class. In the words of one French writer, its members seemed “to live upon a golden cloud.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>An army of servants enabled upper-class ladies and gentlemen to maintain opulent urban mansions and splendid country estates.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Thorstein Veblen coined the term <em>conspicuous consumption</em> to describe upper-class spending habits. All of Europe was their playground. They vacationed at seaside resorts, patronized art exhibits, flocked to mountain spas, and enjoyed stays at elegant hotels.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE MIDDLE CLASS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>About 20 to 25 percent of the European population belonged to the middle class.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The middle class included merchants, shopkeepers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, government employees, factory workers, factory supervisors, and officer workers.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_222"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Cheaper foods and increases in real wages enabled middle-class families to purchase labor saving gadgets such as washing and sewing machines.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Electric street cars enabled middle-class families to live outside the city and commute to work each day.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Cities such as Paris, Vienna, and London featured broad boulevards, parks, and lighted streets. The middle class took advantage of the era’s new streetcars and subways to shop in lavish department stores and enjoy cafés, dance halls, opera houses, and vaudeville shows.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Increasing affluence and leisure time also enabled the middle class to enjoy organized sports such as rugby, cricket, and bicycling.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE WORKING CLASS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>About 75 to 80 percent of the European population belonged to the working class.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Often living on the edge of poverty, the urban working class enjoyed few of the Belle Époque’s wonders and advances. For example, despite major medical advances, tuberculosis and other deadly diseases remained a menace in slums and tenements from Saint Petersburg to Paris.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Electricity, trade unions, and slowly rising wages did improve working-class lives. It is important to note that a strong sense of nationalism, the expansion of male suffrage, and state-sponsored welfare programs all combined to weaken the revolutionary spirit envisioned by Marx and other radical socialists.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution opened economic opportunities to women. Factory work offered higher wages than work performed at home. For example, women spinners in Manchester’s cotton factories received higher pay than women who spun cotton thread at home.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>By the mid-1850s, women and children comprised half of the labor force in the cotton industry. Women were paid about half of a man’s wages for similar work.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Trade unions began to win better wages for working men. But these unions seldom accepted women as members. In fact, unions fought to keep women out of skilled jobs that offered higher wages.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_224"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>During the late 1800s, many working-class women worked as shop clerks, typists, and telephone operators.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Opportunities for well-educated women were limited to teaching, nursing, and social work. Entrenched attitudes limited opportunities in other professions. In 1898, for example, there were only two women lawyers in all of France.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>LEGAL DISCRIMINATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Law codes in most European countries gave women few legal rights. For example, women could not sue or make contracts. If a woman’s husband died, she could not act as the guardian of her children.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>By the 1880s, women began to reverse some of these discriminatory laws. For example, divorce was legalized in Britain in 1857 and in France in 1884. However, Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy, did not permit divorce.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1900, no country in Europe allowed women to vote. Although Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes and was recognized as one of the world’s foremost scientists, she could not vote. “Women are creatures of impulse and emotion,” declared one British member of Parliament. “They do not decide questions on the ground of reason as men do.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In the United States women such as Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony launched a campaign for women’s suffrage at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In Great Britain, women’s rights activists argued that suffrage was the key to redressing legal and economic discrimination. Led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett, the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) attempted to pressure members of Parliament to grant female suffrage.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Infuriated by Parliament’s refusal to grant females the right to vote, Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1903.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The WSPU quickly became Europe’s most militant organization for women’s rights. In addition to peaceful demonstrations and parades, its members cut telegraph wires, heckled government speakers, and chained themselves to gates in front of Parliament.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_225"/>5<span class="C504">.</span>The most publicized militant action occurred when a young WSPU member, Emily Davison, committed suicide by throwing herself in front of the king’s horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby. At her funeral, thousands of women in white dresses carried banners demanding the right to vote.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Although the women’s suffrage movement commanded wide attention, it achieved few successes. In 1900, no country in Europe allowed women to vote.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>“THE ANGEL IN THE HOUSE”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In his 1847 poem “The Princess,” Alfred Tennyson expressed the prevailing view of European gender roles when he wrote: “Man with the head and woman from the heart. Man to command and woman to obey.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>During the second half of the nineteenth century, men ran Europe’s businesses and cast all of its votes. The widespread belief in the cult of domesticity restricted women to their homes. The stay-at-home wife was one of the chief indicators of middle-class respectability.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The ideal middle-class wife was an “angel in the house” who turned her home into a refuge from the hard and impersonal urban world where her husband worked.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Middle-class women were moral guardians who supervised the education of her children. In addition, middle-class women were expected to supervise domestic servants and manage the household.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>THE “NEW WOMAN”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>By the end of the nineteenth century, women lived longer and had fewer children. As a result, educated middle-class women began to enjoy more independent lifestyles.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>A generation of middle-class “New Women” extended their role as guardian of the home to include becoming activists who fought to improve their communities.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The “New Woman” abandoned restrictive corsets and wore fewer petticoats. She used her newfound physical freedom by enjoying bicycling and joining sports clubs.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The pioneering turn-of-the-century “New Women” provided role models for the later feminist movement.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>KEY TRENDS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Universal male suffrage</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Between 1871 and 1914, most European countries extended the franchise to working-class men.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Universal male suffrage led to the creation of mass political parties.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Trade unions and socialist parties</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Trade unions gained rights and played an increasingly important role in Great Britain, France, and Germany.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Workers supported socialist political parties in many European countries.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The welfare state</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Demands for reform by socialist parties and labor unions persuaded European governments to begin enacting legislation to help the lower classes. These programs laid the foundation for the welfare state.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>It is important to note that a desire to counter the growing strength of socialist parties motivated many of the reforms.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Changing balance of power</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The unification of Germany and Italy ended the carefully crafted balance of power created by the Congress of Vienna.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Nationalism, the Second Industrial Revolution, and the skillful use of Realpolitik combined to create an unstable balance of power among the European states.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FRANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Paris Commune, 1871</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Franco-Prussian War left France defeated and humiliated. France’s Third Republic began with the bitter task of ceding the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The people of Paris rejected both the treaty and the new conservative government. Radicals called Communards formed a revolutionary municipal council or “Commune.”</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_227"/><span class="C520">iii.</span>Government troops besieged Paris for two months. The army finally overwhelmed the Communards and mercilessly crushed all opposition.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The bloody suppression of the Paris Commune left a legacy of class hatred that poisoned French politics.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Dreyfus Affair</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Captain Alfred Dreyfus, the first Jewish officer in the French general staff, was convicted in 1894 of selling military secrets to the Germans and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil’s Island off the northern coast of South America.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Although Dreyfus was innocent, a coalition of Catholics, monarchists, anti-Semites, and military officers thwarted attempts to clear his name.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Émile Zola, the famed realist novelist, wrote an article called “J’Accuse” (“I Accuse”), charging that military judges had knowingly let the guilty party go, while Dreyfus remained imprisoned.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Dreyfus was ultimately completely exonerated in 1906.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>The Dreyfus Affair had a number of consequences. It created a nationwide furor that deepened political divisions and revealed widespread anti-Semitism. The Dreyfus Affair also played a key role in Theodor Herzl’s decision to write <em>The Jewish State</em>, calling for a national homeland for the Jewish people.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>GREAT BRITAIN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Irish Question</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Following the Act of Union in 1801, Ireland was united with Great Britain and governed by the British Parliament.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Led by Charles Parnell, Irish nationalists sought to achieve home rule granting Ireland its own parliament.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_228"/><span class="C520">iii.</span>Prime Minister William Gladstone supported Irish home rule. However, a coalition of Conservatives and anti-home-rule Liberals defeated his home-rule bills in 1886 and 1892. Gladstone’s support for Irish home rule split the Liberal Party, enabling the Conservatives to take power.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Parliament finally passed an Irish home-rule bill in 1914. However, the British government suspended the bill for the duration of World War I.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Peaceful reforms</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Franchise Act of 1884 extended voting rights to rural male laborers. By 1914, 80 percent of Britain’s male population was enfranchised.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Parliament laid the foundation for the British welfare state by establishing a system of health and unemployment insurance.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>GERMANY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Social welfare programs</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>During the 1880s, Germany became the first European country to develop a state social welfare program.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Otto von Bismarck’s social welfare legislation included programs for health insurance, accident insurance, and a system of old-age and disability pensions.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Bismarck wanted to prove that the state was a benevolent institution and not an oppressor. He hoped that his social welfare programs would secure the loyalty of workers to the new German empire.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>William II (reigned 1888–1918)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>William I died in 1888 at the age of 90. His grandson, William II, became the new German kaiser. Arrogant and impulsive, William II was determined to rule on his own.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>William II forced Bismarck to resign in 1890. During the next 14 years, he expanded Bismarck’s social reforms. At the same time, Germany’s economic and military power continued to grow.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_229"/>E.</strong></span><strong>RUSSIA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Autocracy and repression</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The assassination of Tsar Alexander II ended Russia’s brief period of reform.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Both Alexander III (reigned 1881–1894) and Nicholas II (reigned 1894–1917) were committed to the traditional policies of autocracy, orthodoxy, and Russification.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Both tsars encouraged anti-Semitic attacks on Jews called <em>pogroms</em>. Russia was the last European state to eliminate legal discrimination against Jews. Virulent anti-Semitism prompted a mass migration of Russian Jews to Western Europe and the United States.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Political movements</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Russia’s program of rapid industrialization spawned a wide range of political movements.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Constitutional Democrats or Kadets wanted a constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Social Democrats worked for economic and political revolution. In 1903, the Social Democrats split into two factions. The Mensheviks favored gradual socialistic reform. Led by Vladimir Lenin, the Bolsheviks advocated a communist revolution spearheaded by a small elite of professional revolutionaries.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Between 1870 and 1900, the Japanese modernized their economy and built a powerful army and navy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>As Japan became stronger, it also became more imperialistic. During the 1890s, Japan expanded its influence in Manchuria, China’s mineral rich northeastern province.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Japan’s growing interest in Manchuria alarmed the Russians, who were also eager to control the province. In 1904, the conflict exploded into the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The Japanese stunned the European powers by easily crushing the Russian forces. Though still technically part of China, Manchuria was now a part of Japan’s sphere of influence.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_230"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>The Revolution of 1905</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Russia’s humiliating defeat in the Russo-Japanese War exposed the weaknesses of the autocratic regime and led to increased unrest.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>On January 22, 1905, Cossacks opened fire on a peaceful crowd of workers outside the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. The “Bloody Sunday” massacre provoked a wave of strikes and demands for change.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Nicholas II reluctantly approved the election of a Russian parliament or Duma.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Nicholas stubbornly refused to work with the Duma, insisting that it become an advisory rather than a legislative body.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The key question</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>How can we explain the tremendous variety of plants and animals that exist on Earth?</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The idea of special creation formed the most widely accepted answer to this question. According to this view, every kind of plant and animal had been created by God at the beginning of the world and remained the same since then.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span><em>On the Origin of Species</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Charles Darwin was a British naturalist whose book <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</em> challenged the Judeo-Christian belief in special creation.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>According to Darwin, within every species more individuals are born than can survive. Therefore, every living thing takes part in a constant “struggle for existence.”</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Only the “fittest” survive this unending struggle for survival. The fittest are determined by a process of natural selection in which new species emerge after gradually accumulating new modifications.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Darwin’s idea of change through natural selection came to be called the theory of evolution.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The controversy</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Darwin’s theory of evolution sparked a storm of controversy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Naturalist Thomas Henry Huxley wrote, “It is doubtful if any single book, except <em>The Principia</em> by Newton, ever worked so great and rapid a revolution in science.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Critics accused Darwin of contradicting the biblical account of creation in which humankind was a unique creation of God. The bishop of Oxford, for example, accused Darwin of “a tendency to limit God’s glory in creation.”</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Darwin’s theory also undermined the Enlightenment belief that rational human beings lived in a tranquil and predictable world. The theory of natural selection suggested an alternate world in which aggressive individuals and groups constantly struggled with one another.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_232"/>C.</strong></span><strong>SOCIAL DARWINISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Herbert Spencer, an English sociologist, applied the concept of natural selection to human society. Spencer argued that free economic competition was natural selection in action. The best companies make profits while inefficient ones go bankrupt. The same rules apply to individuals. This idea became known as Social Darwinism.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Wealthy business and industrial leaders used Social Darwinism to justify their success and explain why others fail. They strongly supported laissez-faire economic policies and opposed social welfare programs.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Social Darwinists also applied the theories of natural selection and survival of the fittest to races and nations. Their theories helped rationalize and justify European imperialism, racism, and militarism.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Social Darwinism later influenced the development of Nazi theories about superior and inferior races.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>It is important to point out that many critics objected to the dangerous misapplication of Darwin’s biological findings to society and races. They argued that Social Darwinism was being used as an excuse for the excesses of individuals and the greed of imperialists.</p>
