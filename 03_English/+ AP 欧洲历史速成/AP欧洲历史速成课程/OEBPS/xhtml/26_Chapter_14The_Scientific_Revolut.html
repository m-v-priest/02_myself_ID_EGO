<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>OLD ASSUMPTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval philosophers accepted a geocentric view that held that the Earth was a motionless body located at the center of the universe. The sun, moon, and planets all moved around the Earth in perfectly circular paths. Common sense seemed to support this view, since the sun appeared to be moving around the Earth as it rose in the morning and set in the evening.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval philosophers believed that different physical laws applied to the Earth and to the heavens. As a result, astrology, alchemy, and witchcraft were all accepted in a world where chance and miracles played important roles.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>TRADITIONAL AUTHORITIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The medieval view of the universe was supported by more than just common sense. Both the Greek philosopher Aristotle and the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy supported the geocentric theory.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Church taught that God had deliberately placed the Earth at the center of the universe. Earth was thus a special place on which the great drama of life took place.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>NICOLAUS COPERNICUS (1473–1543)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Copernicus was a Polish clergyman and astronomer. Published in 1543, his landmark book, <em>On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies</em>, Copernicus directly challenged the geocentric view of the <span id="page_118"/>universe. Copernicus presented his readers with a heliocentric view in which the Earth revolved around the sun, which was the center of the universe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Copernicus’s heliocentric theory represented the first new view of the universe in almost 2,000 years. His work alarmed both Protestant and Catholic leaders. They realized that the heliocentric theory would remove humans from their special place in the center of the universe. The impact of Copernicus’s book was so far-reaching that its title gave rise to the use of the word <em>revolution</em> as meaning radical change.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>JOHANNES KEPLER (1571–1630)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Copernicus’s bold but controversial ideas were based on logic, not on direct observation. In the late 1500s, a Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe, carefully recorded the movements of each known planet. When Brahe died in 1601, his assistant, Johannes Kepler, continued his work.</p>
<p class="C515"><span class="C467">2</span> After carefully studying Brahe’s data, Kepler formulated three laws of planetary motion:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The planets revolve around the sun in elliptical orbits. This law refuted the old belief that planets moved in perfect circles. It placed the sun not at the center of a circle but as one focus of an ellipse.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Planets move more rapidly as their orbits approach the sun.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The time a planet takes to orbit the sun varies proportionately with its distance from the sun.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Kepler’s three laws supported, clarified, and amended Copernicus’s heliocentric system. They revealed the universe as a cosmos of order in which the same physical laws governed the motion of both the earth and the stars.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>GALILEO GALILEI (1564–1642)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Galileo was an Italian scientist who used controlled experiments to observe and measure the motion of objects. Convinced that the “great book of the universe is written in the language of mathematics,” Galileo formulated laws of motion and inertia that he expressed in mathematical formulas.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Galileo learned that a Dutch lens maker had built an instrument that could enlarge distant objects. Without seeing this device, <span id="page_119"/>Galileo successfully built a telescope that made objects appear 30 times nearer and 1,000 times larger.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Galileo used his powerful new telescope to study the heavens. In 1610, he published <em>Starry Messenger</em> describing his astonishing discoveries. Galileo reported that the sun had spots, that Saturn had rings, that the moon had a rough and uneven surface, and that Jupiter had four moons.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Galileo’s discoveries created a sensation. His description of the moon’s surface shattered Aristotle’s theory that the Earth was composed of impure materials, while the moon and stars were made of a pure, eternal substance that was smooth and perfect. Galileo’s finding that moons orbited Jupiter supported the heliocentric theory, thus proving that everything in the cosmos does not revolve around Earth.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>“A VERY DANGEROUS THING”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Catholic Church viewed the new heliocentric model with deep suspicion. Led by Cardinal Bellarmine, Church officials believed that Copernican astronomy was clearly incompatible with Biblical references to the sun “rising” and the Earth “moving.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In a letter to one of Galileo’s followers, Cardinal Bellarmine warned that the new view of the cosmos “is a very dangerous thing” because it threatened “to harm the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture false.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE INQUISITION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Inquisition was a system of courts that investigated anyone who dared voice views that differed from orthodox Church views. In early 1616, the Inquisition directed Cardinal Bellarmine to summon Galileo to Rome and “admonish him to abandon” his heliocentric views.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Galileo understood the Inquisition’s fearsome power. Like other astronomers, he remembered that in 1600 the Inquisition tried, convicted, and then burned Giordano Bruno at the stake for arguing that the Earth was a tiny part of an infinite universe.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Galileo appeared before Cardinal Bellarmine and prudently submitted to a papal edict declaring, “The view that the sun <span id="page_120"/>stands motionless at the center of the universe is foolish, philosophically false, and utterly heretical, because [it is] contrary to Holy Scripture.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE TRIAL OF GALILEO</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Galileo could not remain silent. He pointedly argued, “I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1532, Galileo published <em>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</em>. Although ostensibly impartial, Galileo provided the Copernican adherents with the most persuasive arguments.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1533, the Inquisition charged Galileo with breaking his promise to obey the 1616 edict. On June 22, 1533, the Inquisition pronounced Galileo guilty of heresy and disobedience. The Court then forced the aging scientist to kneel before them and formally repudiate the Copernican theory.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>GALILEO’S LEGACY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The 70-year-old Galileo appeared to be a broken and defeated man. He spent his remaining years living under house arrest, advocating a deductive method for the search for truth.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Although the Church had silenced Galileo, it could not stop the advance of science. The printing press spread Galileo’s ideas and discoveries across Europe.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Bacon contributed to scientific developments in the seventeenth century by advocating an inductive method for scientific experimentation.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The inductive method begins with direct observation of phenomena. This produces data that is systematically recorded and organized. The data leads to a tentative hypothesis that is retested in additional experiments.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Bacon argued that this process of controlled experimentation would lead to the formulation of universal principles and scientific laws.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_121"/>B.</strong></span><strong>RENÉ DESCARTES (1596–1650) AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Descartes contributed to scientific developments in the seventeenth century by advocating a deductive method for the search for truth.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Descartes began by doubting all notions based on authority or custom. Instead, he started with a self-evident axiom known to be true. He then used logical reasoning to deduce various inferences.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Bacon’s inductive method and Descartes’s deductive method proved to be complementary parts of a systematic and logical way of seeking truth known as the scientific method.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The scientific method includes the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Belief in the existence of regular patterns in nature</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Use of controlled experiments to systematically record facts and verify hypotheses</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Sponsored by governments and monarchs, scientists organized societies to promote research and spread scientific knowledge.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Founded in 1660, the Royal Society in England enjoyed international prestige. Other scientific societies were founded in Florence, Paris, and Berlin.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The scientific societies helped create an international scientific community.</p>
