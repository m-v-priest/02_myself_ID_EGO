<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT OF THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>As the commercial revolution gained momentum, the size of the English middle class increased.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>With the exception of the Dutch Republic, the English middle class was proportionally larger than that of any country in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>English entrepreneurs financed joint-stock companies that played a key role in promoting English colonies in North America.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>GENTRY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The gentry included wealthy landowners who dominated the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>It is very important to note that unlike France, the English gentry was willing to pay taxes. This had two significant consequences:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>First, since the tax burden was more equitable in England, the peasantry was not overburdened with excessive taxes.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Second, the gentry and thus the House of Commons demanded a role in determining national expenditures. This created an inevitable conflict with the Stuart kings.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>RELIGION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>By the end of the seventeenth century, Calvinists comprised the largest percentage of the English population.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Puritans continued to demand changes in the Anglican Church.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Stuart kings believed that their authority came from God.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Stuart kings thus wanted a monarchy free from parliamentary restraints.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE ROLE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The House of Commons was dominated by the gentry, merchants, and lawyers.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Members were determined to preserve traditional privileges such as freedom of open debate and immunity from arrest.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>They demanded a stronger voice in political affairs.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ORGANIZATION OF THE ANGLICAN CHURCH</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Stuarts favored the established Episcopal form of church organization. In this hierarchical arrangement, the king, Archbishop of Canterbury, and bishops determined doctrine and practice.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Puritans favored a Presbyterian form of church organization. This arrangement allowed church members a much greater voice in running the church and expressing dissenting views.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>James believed that royal authority came directly from God.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>James published a work called <em>The True Law of Free Monarchies</em> in which he asserted that “kings are not only God’s lieutenants upon earth, and sit on God’s throne, but even by God himself they are called gods.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>QUARRELS WITH PARLIAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Puritan members of Parliament urged James to “purify” the Church of England of “popish remnants” including the authority of bishops.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_91"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>James was convinced that the Presbyterian system of church government would destroy royal control of the church and threaten the monarchy. He reportedly summed up his opposition by declaring, “No bishops, no king.”</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In return for grants of money, Charles I agreed to the Petition of Right.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Petition of Right contained two key provisions:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>No one should be compelled to pay any tax or loan “without common consent by act of Parliament.”</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>No one should be imprisoned without due process of law.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>RELIGIOUS POLICIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Religion was the single most explosive issue in England.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>With Charles’s encouragement, William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to transform the Church of England into a Catholic church without a pope.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1639, Laud foolishly attempted to impose the English Prayer Book on the Scottish Presbyterian Church.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Determined to defend their religion, the Scots formed an army and occupied northern England.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE LONG PARLIAMENT, 1640–1648</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Desperate for money to fight the Scots, Charles reluctantly recalled Parliament into session, thus precipitating a constitutional and religious crisis.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_92"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Determined to undo what they saw as royal tyranny, the Long Parliament executed Laud and passed a number of laws limiting royal power.</p>

<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In late 1653, Cromwell took the title Lord Protector, establishing a one-man rule supported by the army.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FOREIGN POLICY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Cromwell brutally crushed a royalist uprising in Ireland. Protestant landlords replaced Catholic property owners. Nearly half of Ireland’s population may have perished from famine and plague.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>England passed the Navigation Act of 1651. The act barred Dutch ships from carrying goods between other countries and England. The act was also designed to give England greater control over its American colonies.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>England waged a series of wars that weakened the Dutch.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>DOMESTIC POLICY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Puritans attempted to impose a strict moral code that censored the press, prohibited sports, and closed theaters.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Cromwell opposed radical groups such as the Levellers and the Quakers.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Levellers advocated a more egalitarian society with nearly universal manhood suffrage and a written constitution guaranteeing equal rights to all.</p>
