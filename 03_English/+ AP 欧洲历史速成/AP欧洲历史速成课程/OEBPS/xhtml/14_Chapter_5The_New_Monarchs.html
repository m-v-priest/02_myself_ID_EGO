<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF MEDIEVAL KINGS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval kings received most of their income from their own estates and from grants of money from their vassals.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval kings marched to war followed by an army of vassals who owed military service in exchange for land.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval kings relied upon nobles for advice and counsel.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Powerful nobles waged war, taxed their peasants, and administered and enforced the law—all rights that were normally the prerogatives of a sovereign state.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Medieval kings shared power with the Church and were often subordinate to the pope.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NEW MONARCHS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Between 1450 and 1550 strong rulers known as new monarchs unified France, England, and Spain.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The new monarchs retained their feudal income while also taxing towns, merchants, and peasants.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The new monarchs created professional armies that were paid from the royal treasury.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The new monarchs created a more centralized administrative bureaucracy that relied upon educated and loyal middle-class officials.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The new monarchs negotiated a new relationship with the Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_42"/>C.</strong></span><strong>FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RISE OF THE NEW MONARCHS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Innovations in military weapons dramatically increased the power of the new monarchs. For example, cannonballs propelled by gunpowder enabled royal armies to breach the once impregnable stone walls of feudal castles. At the same time, soldiers equipped with new muzzle-loaded firearms could fire volleys that decimated the ranks of armored knights.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The growth of towns produced an increasingly prosperous middle class that prized peace and helped rulers establish and enforce predictable laws.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The development of a centralized administration gave the new monarchs greater control over commerce and trade.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>FRANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Charles VII (reigned 1422–1461)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Charles VII successfully concluded the Hundred Years’ War by expelling the English from France.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>He strengthened royal finances through such taxes as the taille (on land) and the gabelle (on salt). These two taxes were the main source of royal income for the next three centuries.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>He combined cavalry and archers to form Europe’s first permanent royal army. Charles VII completed 60 successful castle sieges in just one year.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>He established a royal council, using middle-class merchants as his officials. Charles VII chose his advisors so wisely that he won the nickname “Charles the Well-Served.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XI (reigned 1461–1483)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Louis XI earned the nickname the “Spider King” because of his treacherous character and ruthless use of power. For example, he imprisoned a disloyal cardinal in a small cage for 11 excruciating years.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>He encouraged economic growth by promoting new industries such as silk weaving.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_43"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Francis I (reigned 1515–1547)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Francis I was the first French king to be called “Your Majesty.”</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>He reached an agreement with Pope Leo X known as the Concordat of Bologna (1516), which authorized the king to nominate bishops, abbots, and other high officials of the Catholic Church in France. This agreement gave the French monarch administrative control over the Church.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ENGLAND</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Henry VII (reigned 1485–1509)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Henry VII created a special court known as the Star Chamber as a political weapon to try prominent nobles. Court sessions were held in secret with no right of appeal, no juries, and no witnesses.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>He used justices of the peace to extend royal authority into the local shires.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>He encouraged the wool industry and expanded the English merchant marine.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Henry VIII (reigned 1509–1547)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Henry VIII declared the king the supreme head of the Church of England, thus severing England’s ties with the Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>He dissolved the monasteries and confiscated their land and wealth.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>SPAIN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Iberian Peninsula in the mid-fifteenth century</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>During this time, the Iberian Peninsula enjoyed a rich cultural diversity that included prominent Jewish and Muslim communities.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The kingdoms of Castile and Aragon dominated Navarre and Portugal. The Muslims held only the small kingdom of Granada.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_44"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Ferdinand (reigned 1479–1516) and Isabella (reigned 1474–1504)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile (1469) created a dynastic union of the Iberian Peninsula’s two most powerful royal houses.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Ferdinand and Isabella reduced the number of nobles on the royal council.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Ferdinand and Isabella completed the <em>Reconquista</em> by conquering Granada and incorporating it into the Spanish kingdom.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Isabella decreed that in a Christian state, there could be only “one king, one law, one faith.” She and Ferdinand established the Inquisition to enforce religious conformity.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella issued an edict expelling all practicing Jews from Spain. Ten years later, they demanded that all Muslims adopt Christianity or leave Spain<em/>.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>A COMPETITIVE STATE SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>By 1600, new monarchs in France, England, and Spain boasted standing armies, royal courts, and the financial support of increasingly prosperous merchants.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The emergence of powerful monarchs in France, England, and Spain marked the beginning of Europe’s competitive state system.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The competitive state system promoted the practice of modern diplomacy. Rulers sent official representatives to rival nations in order to be informed about their plans and policies. The new diplomacy encouraged negotiation and prevented war.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The new diplomacy encouraged balance-of-power politics. Unrestrained by religious or legal limitations, sovereign rulers strove for power and wealth. When one nation posed a threat to neighboring states, they responded by forming a coalition to preserve the balance of power.</p>
