<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>GENERAL OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution refers to the process by which economic production shifted from the use of hand tools to the use of power machinery, first fueled by coal and steam.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the 1750s.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Napoleonic Wars delayed industrial growth in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Continental Europe began to industrialize after 1815. The Industrial Revolution spread from Western Europe to Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>HISTORIC IMPACT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution caused a process of modernization that dominated life in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution concentrated factories and workers in industrial centers. This promoted a process of urbanization that led to the growth of urban centers across Europe. Between 1800 and 1850, the number of European cities with a population of more than 100,000 inhabitants rose from 22 to 47.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution led to the formation of a new self-conscious social class, the working class, or proletariat.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution also led to the formation of a new and expanding middle class, or bourgeoisie.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution and urbanization had a dramatic effect upon families, including the role of women and childhood experiences.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_182"/>6<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution improved the standard of living by providing more consumer products, improved medical care, and new leisure activities.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>The benefits of industrialization solidified Britain’s position as one of the dominant European powers.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE ENCLOSURE MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>This movement, which privatized land formerly available to all for grazing and farming, concentrated land ownership in fewer hands.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>With no land to work, small farmers were displaced, thus forming a pool of cheap labor.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Crop rotation replaced the open-field system.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Landowners experimented with new crops such as turnips and new inventions such as the seed drill.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The revolution in agriculture made it possible for fewer farmers to feed more people.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE POPULATION EXPLOSION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>New farming methods produced more food.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Medical advances such as Edward Jenner’s discovery of a smallpox vaccine reduced death rates.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The combined population of Great Britain and Ireland increased from 10 million in 1750 to 30 million in 1850.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>This dramatic increase in population created a growing market that stimulated production.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Successful British merchants had large amounts of wealth accumulated from global trade.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Great Britain had a stable, well-developed banking system that funded industrial development.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_183"/>E.</strong></span><strong>GEOGRAPHIC ADVANTAGES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Britain had abundant supplies of coal and iron ore. Coal replaced wood as a key source of energy, while iron was used to manufacture tools and construct buildings.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Britain was geographically compact. No place in Britain was more than 70 miles from the sea or more than 30 miles from a navigable river. As a result, Britain formed a national market.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Britain had many rivers and ports, which facilitated trade and shipping.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>STABLE AND SUPPORTIVE GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Political stability encouraged economic growth and innovation.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Britain had no internal tariffs or trade barriers.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>G.</strong></span><strong>THE ENLIGHTENMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Founded in London in 1660, the Royal Society became a world-famous organization for the exchange of ideas and practical inventions.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>British society encouraged and rewarded inventors and entrepreneurs.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE INCENTIVE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The global demand for cotton cloth was enormous.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Prompted by huge potential profits, British entrepreneurs financed new ways of spinning and weaving cotton.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE INVENTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1733, John Kay invented the flying shuttle, enabling a single weaver to work twice as fast.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In the mid-1760s, James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, a spinning machine that made it possible for a single weaver to work six to eight threads at a time.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_184"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1769, Richard Arkwright invented a water frame that used water power from fast-moving streams to drive spinning machines.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>In 1779, Samuel Crompton invented a spinning machine called the mule that combined the best features of the spinning jenny and the water frame to produce thread that was stronger, finer, and more uniform than earlier spinning machines.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>In 1785, Edmund Cartwright invented a power loom that used water power to dramatically speed up weaving.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>In 1793, Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, making it possible to efficiently remove seeds from the cotton fiber.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>As a result of these continuous technological improvements, the output of cotton fiber from British textile factories rose from 40 million yards in 1785 to more than 2 billion yards in 1850.</p>

<p class="C737"><strong><em>APEURO test writers do not focus on the sequence of inventions that revolutionized the textile industry. Instead, you should know that these inventions marked a shift from human and animal power to mechanical power. The mechanization of the spinning and weaving process in the textile industry ushered in the Industrial Revolution</em>.</strong></p>

</div>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE STEAM ENGINE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>James Watt patented the first steam engine in 1769.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The steam engine rapidly replaced water power in British textile factories.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Steam power played a key role in boosting iron production.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE RAILROAD</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Steam power enabled inventors to build railroad locomotives.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>English entrepreneurs wanted a railroad line to connect the port of Liverpool with the inland city of Manchester, the heart of the spinning and weaving industry. The Liverpool-Manchester Railway opened in 1830.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>By 1850, Britain had over 6,000 miles of railroad track. Each mile of newly laid track required 300 tons of iron.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_185"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>Railroads revolutionized the technology of overland travel. For centuries, a team of four horses pulled uncomfortable stagecoaches on long and tedious trips. Railroads provided a faster, cheaper, and more comfortable means of transportation.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Railroads improved diet by providing access to perishable food. Trains carried fresh fish inland from the coasts and fresh vegetables from rural farms to city markets.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Railroads promoted leisure travel by making it possible for urban residents to spend a weekend at coastal resorts.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>The railroads successful combination of steam, coal, and iron became the supreme symbol of the new age of industrial progress.</p>

<p class="C737"><strong><em>APEURO test writers place great emphasis upon the significance of railroads as a turning point in European history. You should be able to identify specific historic examples that illustrate the importance of railroads. You should also be able to identify limitations of nineteenth-century railroads.

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE LUDDITES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The new textile technologies threatened the jobs of Britain’s 250,000 hand-loom weavers. Named after Ned Ludd, frustrated English weavers known as Luddites broke into early textile factories and smashed the machinery.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>These acts of despair could not stop the Industrial Revolution. Parliament quickly responded by passing a law making the destruction of machines a capital offense. By 1850, there were less than 50,000 weavers.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Workers gradually came to realize that destroying machines would not improve their lives. Instead, they had to form labor unions to fight for higher wages and better working conditions.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_186"/>B.</strong></span><strong>EARLY LABOR UNIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 prohibited British workers from organizing to improve their condition.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Under pressure from labor and middle-class reformers, Parliament repealed the Combination Acts in 1824.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1875, British trade unions won full legal status, including the right to strike.</p>
