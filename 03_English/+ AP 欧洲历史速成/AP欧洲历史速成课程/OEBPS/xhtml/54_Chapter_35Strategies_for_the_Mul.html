<p class="C851"><strong>Strategies for the Multiple-Choice Questions</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Your exam will have between 16 and 18 sets of multiple-choice questions. Each set will contain a stimulus prompt followed by 2, 3, or 4 questions. There are no sets with 1 or 5 questions. The majority of the stimulus prompts will utilize primary source passages and accounts written by modern historians. In addition, you will often be asked to evaluate a political cartoon, map, or graph.</p>
<p class="C752">Each of the 55 multiple-choice questions is worth 1 point. The multiple-choice section thus comprises 40 percent of 140 points on an APEURO exam. There is no guessing penalty so be sure to answer each question.</p>
<p class="C752">The multiple-choice questions are not designed to test your ability to recall information from long lists of names, dates, and places. Instead, test writers focus on asking you to demonstrate your ability to use historical reasoning processes such as comparison, causation, change, and continuity over time. As a result, answers focus on your ability to identify key historic trends, patterns, and influential ideas.</p>

<p class="C752">Here is a sample primary source stimulus passage and a set of 4 multiple-choice questions:</p>
<p class="C1139">“Above all, Fascism . . . believes neither in the possibility nor in the utility of perpetual peace. It thus repudiates the doctrines of Pacifism—born of a renunciation of the struggle and an act of cowardice in the face of sacrifice. War alone brings up to their highest tension all human energies and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have the courage to meet it. All other trials are substitutes, which never really put a man in front of himself in the alternatives of life and death. A doctrine, therefore, which begins with a prejudice in favor of peace is foreign to Fascism . . . ”</p>
<p class="C1032">Benito Mussolini,<br/>
<em>The Doctrine of Fascism</em>, 1932</p>
<p class="C779"><span id="page_330"/>1<span class="C504">.</span>The Fascist movement was most clearly part of which of the following political trends during the 1920s and 1930s?</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C758">A)</span>The increasing role of women as political leaders</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C758">B)</span>The rise of totalitarian governments</p>

<p class="C779">2<span class="C504">.</span>Mussolini’s scorn for “the utility of perpetual peace” was most likely a reaction to which of the following?</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C758">A)</span>The growing influence of feminist agitation for greater political and social rights</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C758">B)</span>The hyperinflation that struck the Weimar Republic in 1923</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C758">C)</span>The decision of Great Britain and France to appease Hitler at the Munich Conference</p>

<p class="C765">(<span class="C758">A)</span>The commitment to the rule of law and majority rule by classical liberals</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C758">B)</span>The fascination with the unconscious by Freudian theorists</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C758">C)</span>The glorification of militarism by the Futurists</p>

</table>
<p class="C1142"><strong>STEP ONE: Carefully read the attribution line at the end of the excerpt.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Most students begin by carefully reading the passage. Resist this temptation. Instead begin by focusing on the information in the attribution line at the end of the passage. The brief but vital information contained in the attribution provides the historic context for the passage. For example, the attribution line in the example above tells you three key facts. First, Mussolini wrote the passage. Second, he focused on the characteristic features of Fascism. And third, he wrote the document in 1932.</p>
<p class="C752">These three facts are important historic clues that should focus your thinking. For example, what comes to mind when you think of Mussolini, Fascism, and the year 1932? Your thoughts could include the emergence of totalitarian dictators, the Great Depression, and Hitler’s imminent rise to power. It is also important to remember that the Treaty of Versailles still remained intact and that World War II had not yet begun.</p>
<p class="C1142"><strong>STEP TWO: Read the passage looking for the main ideas.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The passage is called a stimulus for a reason. Don’t overanalyze the passage. Instead read the passage noting how the author uses key words and facts to support a main idea. In this passage, Mussolini asserts that Fascism glorifies war and renounces peace. This clearly foreshadows Mussolini’s rejection of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, invasion of Ethiopia, and alliance with Hitler.</p>
<p class="C1142"><strong><span id="page_332"/>STEP THREE: Use the process of elimination.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Many times your knowledge of the topic will enable you to quickly spot the correct answer. However, there are questions in which the correct answer will not jump out and say, “Here I am!” When this happens, don’t panic. Each APEURO multiple-choice question will contain answers that are clearly historically incorrect. For example, in Question 1 on <a href="54_Chapter_35Strategies_for_the_Mul.html#page_330">page 330,</a> you can eliminate answer choices (A), (C), and (D) because women were not yet political leaders, the Bolshevik Revolution did not fail in the Soviet Union, and utopian socialists failed to gain power in any European country. Using the process of elimination the correct answer to Question 1 is clearly (B).</p>
<p class="C752">Remember that eliminating at least two answer choices means that you will have a 50–50 chance of correctly answering the question. By making an educated guess, you should be able to answer at least 30 to 32 multiple-choice questions thus earning half of the 63 to 65 points you need to score a 3.</p>
<p class="C1142"><strong>STEP FOUR: Answer each question in the set.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">You should now be ready to answer each question in the set. Here are the answers to questions 1–4.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Question 1:</strong> This question is based on the historical thinking skill of contextualization. Choices (A) and (D) are incorrect because women and utopian socialists were not political leaders during the 1920s and 1930s. Choice (C) is incorrect because the Bolshevik Revolution was a success, not a failure. The Fascist movement was at least in part a reaction to the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in the Soviet Union. The correct answer is (B) because Fascism was an integral part of the growing movement towards totalitarian governments in southern and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Question 2:</strong> This question is based on the historical reasoning process of causation. Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because the feminist movement and hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic had little or no influence on Mussolini’s scorn for peace. Choice (C) is wrong because the Munich Conference took place six years after Mussolini published <em>The Doctrine of Fascism</em>. The correct answer is (D) because Mussolini scorned the Kellogg-Briand’s repudiation of war as a weak and ineffectual policy that violated the militaristic tenets of Fascism.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Question 3:</strong> This question is based on the historical reasoning process of comparison. Choice (A) is incorrect because the goals of classical liberals are completely antithetical to the goals of Fascism. Choice (B) is incorrect because Freudian theorists were concerned with an internal conflict between the id and the superego. In contrast, Mussolini’s view of conflict is based upon the belief that one nation must impose its will on other nations. Choice (D) is incorrect because existentialists focused on individuals giving meaning to their lives by making choices. In contrast, Mussolini’s view of Fascism was based upon <span id="page_333"/>a supreme leader making choices for the entire nation. Choice (C) is correct because both Mussolini and the Futurists embraced militarism. For example, in the “Futurist Manifesto” Filippo Marinetti emphatically declared, “We will glorify war—the only cure for the world—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchist . . .”</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Question 4:</strong> This question is based on the historical reasoning process of causation. Choice (A) is incorrect because the Italian army successfully conquered Ethiopia. Choice (B) is incorrect because the League of Nations did not impose punishing sanctions on Italy. Choice (C) is incorrect because King Victor Emmanuel gave in and named Mussolini prime minister. Choice (D) is correct because Mussolini successfully appealed to embittered Italian nationalists who felt betrayed by the League of Nations.</p>
