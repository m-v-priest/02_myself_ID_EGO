<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The explorers embodied the same spirit of individualism and curiosity that characterized Renaissance artists and humanist scholars.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The renewed interest in ancient writings that inspired Renaissance artists also gave the explorers new knowledge about mathematics, astronomy, and geography.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE SEARCH FOR SPICES AND PROFITS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Crusades helped stimulate a growing demand for Indian pepper, Chinese ginger, and Malukan cloves and nutmeg.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>By the fourteenth century, European demand for Asian spices and luxury items far exceeded the supply. Muslims and Venetians controlled trade routes to the East.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The new monarchs in Spain and Portugal wanted direct access to the lucrative Asian markets.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE DESIRE TO CULTIVATE CASH CROPS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>A strong and growing demand for sugar motivated Europeans to look for lands suitable for cultivating this prized cash crop.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Europeans hoped to find lands where they could establish sugar plantations.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_46"/>D.</strong></span><strong>THE DESIRE TO SPREAD CHRISTIANITY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Crusades left a legacy of hostility between Christians and Muslims.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Spain and Portugal, Europeans hoped to reconquer northern Africa from the Muslims.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Europeans believed they had a duty to spread Christianity.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE ABILITY TO USE NEW TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The newly designed caravel had square sails for running before the wind and triangular sails for tacking into the wind.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The magnetic compass and the astrolabe enabled mariners to determine their location at sea.</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Portuguese did not attempt to conquer territories. Instead, they built fortified trading posts designed to control trade routes.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521"><span id="page_47"/>ii.</span>The most important Portuguese trading posts were located at Goa on the Indian coast, at Malacca on the Malay peninsula, and at Macao on the southern coast of China.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Age of Exploration—also called the Age of Discovery—involved more than just the search for gold, silver, and spices.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The new discoveries sparked an unprecedented global diffusion of agricultural products, animals, diseases, and human populations.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NEW WORLD TO OLD WORLD</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Agricultural products: potatoes, maize, tomatoes, peanuts, tobacco, vanilla, and chocolate</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Animals: turkeys</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Diseases: possibly syphilis</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>OLD WORLD TO NEW WORLD</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Agricultural products: coffee, cane sugar, wheat, and rice</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Animals: cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and chickens</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Diseases: smallpox, measles, and diphtheria</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Human populations: European colonists and African slaves</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES OF THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>For the New World</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>European diseases decimated indigenous populations. Approximately 90 percent of the indigenous peoples of the Americas perished between 1492 and 1600.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The sudden collapse of entire New World communities enabled European colonists to more easily gain control over Native American lands.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>For Europe</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Nutritious New World crops revolutionized the European diet and fueled a surge in European population.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The influx of gold and silver facilitated economic growth and contributed to the rising prosperity of the merchant class in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_49"/><span class="C520">iii.</span>The wealth generated by New World colonies facilitated Western Europe’s historic shift from a stagnant feudal economy to a new and more energetic commercial capitalist economy.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>For Africa</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Spanish quickly discovered that coffee and sugar flourished in New World soils and climates. These highly prized crops produced great profits but required a large labor force.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The severe drop in the New World population forced the Spanish to look to Africa for a source of labor. Between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, European slave traders forcibly transported over 10 million Africans to the Americas. The African slave trade marked the largest involuntary migration of people in human history.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>SUGAR AND SLAVERY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The history of slavery became intertwined with the cultivation of sugar.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Columbus introduced sugar cane to Hispaniola. Within a short time, a “white gold” rush began on sugar plantations and spread across the island.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Sugar quickly became the most valuable cash crop grown in the British Empire. For example, by 1700 the English West Indies produced 25,000 tons of sugar, worth four times the value of Chesapeake tobacco.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Sugar plantations required large fields, costly equipment, and a huge labor force working under strict supervision. The overwhelming majority worked on plantations in the Caribbean and Brazil.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>New ocean trade routes</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The trade in spices, sugar, and precious metals brought great wealth to the European trading nations.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_50"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>The wealth supported increased investment and a wide array of new economic ventures.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Growth of population</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The introduction of new foods played a key role in supporting population growth.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The population of Europe increased from 70 million in 1500 to 90 million in 1600.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The steady rise in population increased overall demand for goods and services.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Price revolution</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>During the sixteenth century, the Western European economy experienced a steady inflation in prices.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The influx of gold and silver from the New World and the rising demand created by the growth of population contributed to the price revolution.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>New nation-centered economic system</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Prior to 1500, the Western European economy was organized around towns and guilds. Both relied upon strict regulations to ensure their survival. As a result, there was very little innovation.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>As commercial activity increased, a new nation-centered economic system began to replace the old town-and-guild framework.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>New entrepreneurs</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The expansion of commercial activity created large geographic markets. The new trading areas opened new opportunities while also requiring a new kind of economic leadership.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>As the commercial revolution replaced the town-and-guild framework, merchants and bankers emerged as influential and successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Italian Medici family and the German Fuggers were prominent examples of the new economic entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_51"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>New industries</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The printing press created a national and even international market for books.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The new ocean trading routes sparked a rise in shipbuilding.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The emergence of nation-states supported the large-scale manufacture of cannons and muskets.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>New domestic or putting-out system</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Strict guild regulations stifled competition and restricted production.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In order to avoid the restrictive guild system, entrepreneurs provided cloth, looms, and other equipment to rural families.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The putting-out or domestic system led to a significant increase in the production of cloth and other manufactured goods.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>New joint-stock companies</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The new international trade required unprecedented amounts of capital. For example, merchants had to arm their ships, buy special privileges for local authorities, and build trading posts. Wars, storms, and rivals all threatened profits.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>English and Dutch merchants formed joint-stock companies to maximize profits and limit risks.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Investors in a joint-stock company bought shares of ownership. If the company went bankrupt, its owners lost their investment. If the companies prospered, the investors’ shares of ownership entitled them to collect a proportional share of the profits.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MERCANTILISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The rulers of the new nation-states adopted a system of economic principles and policies called mercantilism.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Mercantilists wanted to build strong, self-sufficient economies.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>According to mercantilist theory, colonies should export raw materials and import finished goods. This would create a favorable balance of trade and the resulting growth of national reserves of gold and silver.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Decline of early commercial centers</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>During the 1400s, a confederacy of Baltic towns known as the Hanseatic League dominated northern European trade. As the center of European trade shifted to the rising nation-states in Western Europe, the Hanseatic League rapidly declined.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Led by Venice, Italian city-states had controlled the lucrative trade with India. The Portuguese broke this monopoly by pioneering a new sea route to Asia.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Rise of capitalism</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Capitalism is an economic system in which capital, or wealth, is invested to produce more capital.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Capitalism is based upon the private ownership of property such as land, raw materials, and equipment.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Capitalists are motivated by a desire to earn profits.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The Age of Discovery ushered in a new economic era dominated by commercial capitalism.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Rise of the bourgeoisie</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>As commercial capitalism expanded so did the class of entrepreneurs. The new middle class became known as the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>As commercial capitalism expanded, so did the wealth and power of the bourgeoisie.</p>
