<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>KEY CHARACTERISTICS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The monarch embodied the sovereignty of a country.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The monarch was not subordinate to a national assembly.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The monarch must exercise control over the nobility.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The monarch must exercise effective control over the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The monarch must command a large standing army.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ABSOLUTE MONARCHS AND TWENTIETH-CENTURY DICTATORS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Absolute monarchs lacked the financial and technological resources commanded by twentieth-century dictators such as Stalin and Hitler.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Absolute monarchs did not attempt to mobilize mass support for their programs. For example, absolute monarchs did not have any program comparable to the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Absolute monarchs did commission art to create visual symbols of their power. However, they did not create propaganda campaigns comparable to those utilized by twentieth-century dictators.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>HENRY IV</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Edict of Nantes, 1598</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The edict granted religious toleration to the French Huguenots.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>It established Henry IV as a politique who placed political expediency above religious principles.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Duke de Sully and financial reform</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The French tax system was both inefficient and inequitable. Nobles were exempt from paying taxes. As a result, the burden fell most heavily upon the peasants.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Henry appointed the Duke de Sully as his chief minister. Sully could not make the tax system more just. But he did make it more efficient. His policies reduced the royal debt, built new roads and canals, revived industry and agriculture, and encouraged colonization in the New World.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The nobility of the robe</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The nobles posed the greatest threat to the extension of royal power. The influence of this “nobility of the sword” was based upon inherited privileges and a tradition of military service.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Henry IV and Sully began the process of raising revenue by selling government offices that conferred nobility. Known as robe nobles, these new nobles were members of the increasingly prosperous bourgeoisie.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>LOUIS XIII AND CARDINAL RICHELIEU</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The rise of Richelieu</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Henry IV was assassinated in 1610, leaving his nine-year-old son Louis XIII (reigned 1610–1643) as the second Bourbon monarch.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In 1624, Louis appointed Cardinal Richelieu to be his chief minister. Richelieu was the real ruler of France from 1624 until his death in 1642.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Richelieu worked tirelessly and successfully to enhance royal power. Like Henry IV, Richelieu was a politique who placed public order above religious zeal.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_101"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>The intendant system</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Richelieu was determined to weaken the nobility.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>At that time, France was divided into thirty-two administrative districts. Richelieu replaced nobles with royal officials called intendants. The intendants implemented royal orders.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The intendants were typically middle-class or minor nobles drawn from the nobility of the robe.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The intendant system played an important role in strengthening royal power.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>It is important to note that while the intendant system curbed the nobles’ political power, it did not lessen their economic or social privileges.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>International affairs</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Richelieu continued France’s long-term policy of limiting Habsburg power.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Richelieu supported the Protestant powers during the Thirty Years’ War. His skillful diplomacy and well-timed interventions helped defeat the Habsburgs and make France the leading European power.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE FRONDE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The deaths of Richelieu in 1642 and Louis XIII the following year left the monarchy in the hands of the five-year-old Louis XIV and his chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Sensing royal weakness, the nobles led a series of rebellions against royal authority. Known as the Fronde, these rebellions were intended to limit rather than overthrow the monarchy.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Increasing violence and instability forced the young king, Louis XIV, to flee Paris. Louis remembered this humiliation and vowed to control the nobility.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>BISHOP BOSSUET AND THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Bishop Bossuet was a prominent French churchman, a renowned orator, and the principal theorist of the seventeenth-century doctrine of absolutism.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Bossuet argued that all power comes from God. The king inherited his position and authority from God.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Royal power was absolute. Subjects must obey their sovereign as the direct representative of God on earth.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>While royal power was absolute, it was not arbitrary. Monarchs had to obey God’s laws and were responsible to God for their conduct.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>“I AM THE STATE”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XIV was the most powerful monarch in French history. Unlike the English monarchs, Louis did not share his power with a parliament. In Louis’s view, he and the nation were the same. He reportedly boasted, <em>“L’etat, c’est moi,”</em> meaning “I am the state.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Louis increased the powers of the intendants, refused to appoint a chief minister, and regularly attended meetings of his four great councils.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Louis continued Richelieu’s policy of reducing the political power of the French nobility. He excluded nobles from key positions and instead appointed men from bourgeoisie and recently ennobled families.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE VERSAILLES PALACE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>As an absolute monarch, Louis XIV determined foreign policy, commanded the army, and supported the arts. His description of himself as the “Sun King” was accurate. In France, all aspects of political life and culture revolved around Louis XIV.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XIV understood the power of art as propaganda and the value of visual imagery for cultivating a public image. The Versailles Palace was designed to be a visible symbol of Louis XIV’s absolute power and greatness.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_103"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>The Versailles Palace underscored France’s cultural dominance. French art, philosophy, architecture, and fashions were envied and copied throughout the continent.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>COLBERT AND MERCANTILISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XIV named Jean-Baptiste Colbert as controller general of finances. Colbert worked tirelessly to strengthen France’s economy by implementing strict mercantilist policies.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Colbert expanded manufacturing by abolishing domestic tariffs that inhibited trade. At the same time, he protected French products by placing high tariffs on goods coming into the country.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Colbert recognized the importance of colonies as a source of raw materials and a market for manufactured goods. He encouraged people to emigrate to Canada where the lucrative fur trade promoted French commerce.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Colbert was able to raise royal revenues and promote economic growth. However, he was unable to make the tax system more equitable. Nobles continued to enjoy exemptions while peasants continued to bear a disproportionate tax burden.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>REVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>When Louis XIV’s reign began, France’s population of 19 million people included about a million Huguenots. The Huguenots continued to enjoy religious toleration and had remained loyal to the crown during the Fronde.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Louis’s goal of having “one king, one law, one faith” precluded religious diversity. Supported by the French Catholic clergy and his Jesuit advisors, Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Royal officials closed Protestant churches and ordered all Protestant children baptized as Catholics.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XIV paid a high price for his religious intolerance. To escape persecution, some 200,000 Huguenots fled to England, the Dutch Republic, Protestant German states, and the New World. As a result, France lost many skilled workers and business leaders.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>STRATEGIC GOALS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>France was the most powerful and populous nation in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XIV had two strategic goals:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>First, he wanted France to expand to its “natural frontiers” along the Rhine River and Switzerland.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Second, he wanted to make France a global power by inheriting the Spanish Habsburg possessions in the New World and in Europe.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE BALANCE OF POWER</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XIV’s powerful army and ambitious plans threatened to create a “universal monarchy” in which other nations would be subordinated to France’s political will.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Alone, no European country was a match for France. However, by joining together, weaker countries could equal or even exceed French power. This defensive strategy is known as a balance of power. In such a balance, no one country can dominate the others.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Louis repeatedly sent French armies into the Netherlands in an attempt to extend his boundaries to the Rhine River. Each time, a coalition formed by the Dutch Republic thwarted him.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION, 1701–1713</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1700, the balance of power was once again threatened when the childless king of Spain, Charles II, died. In his will, the dying king bequeathed the Spanish throne and its huge overseas empire to Louis’s 17-year-old grandson, Philip of Anjou.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The nations of Europe feared that Louis could now create a universal monarchy that would upset the balance of power. Led by England, they formed a Grand Alliance that included Holland, Austria, Brandenburg, and the Italian duchy of Savoy.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The War of the Spanish Succession proved to be a costly struggle that left France battered and weakened. The war’s huge debts played a key role in worsening financial and social tensions that would later erupt in the French Revolution.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_105"/>D.</strong></span><strong>THE TREATY OF UTRECHT, 1713</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Treaty of Utrecht created a new balance of power that preserved the peace for 30 years.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>French gains</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Louis’s grandson, Philip V, was allowed to remain king of Spain as long as the thrones of Spain and France were not united.</p>

<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>English gains</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>England gained valuable French colonies in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Austrian gains</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Austria gained the Spanish Netherlands (Belgium), which then became known as the Austrian Netherlands.</p>

<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The Duke of Savoy</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>As a reward for joining the Grand Alliance, the Duke of Savoy received Sicily and the title of king.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In 1720, Savoy ceded Sicily to Austria in exchange for Sardinia.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>The Elector of Brandenburg</p>

<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Spanish power reached its zenith during the reign of Philip II (reigned 1556–1598).</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Spanish power and prestige began to steadily decline during the seventeenth century.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMIC DECLINE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The expulsion of Jews and converted Muslims, known as Moriscos, deprived Spain of prosperous merchants and skilled workers.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The flow of gold and silver from Mexico and Peru proved to be a mixed blessing. At first, the precious metals enriched the Spanish economy. However, the flood of imported silver also caused inflation, which increased the cost of Spanish textiles and other products. As a result, Spanish exports declined.</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The economy of the Dutch Republic also suffered from costly wars. In 1670, both France and England attacked the Dutch Republic.

<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Spain’s population shrank from approximately 7.5 million in 1550 to 5.5 million in 1660. A declining population reduced the domestic demand for Spanish goods.</p>
