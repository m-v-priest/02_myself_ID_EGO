<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the late sixteenth century, the seven northern provinces of the Netherlands fought for and won their independence from Spain. The Peace of Westphalia formally recognized the Dutch Republic’s independence.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Unlike the other continental nations, the Dutch were not governed by an absolute ruler.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Instead, political power passed into the hands of an oligarchy of wealthy merchants. However, strong assemblies in each province enabled elected delegates to give the people a voice in their local governments.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>RELIGIOUS TOLERATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Calvinism was the dominant faith in the Dutch Republic.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>However, Catholics, Lutherans, Anabaptists, and Jews all enjoyed religious freedom.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The openness of Dutch society permitted a free exchange of ideas.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Dutch placed economic prosperity ahead of religious uniformity. As a result, they created a cosmopolitan society that promoted commerce.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>“THE WHOLE WORLD STANDS AMAZED”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the seventeenth century, Amsterdam emerged from relative obscurity to become the world’s greatest center of trade.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_84"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Amsterdam’s prosperity amazed European visitors. A contemporary Dutch historian proudly boasted, “The whole world stands amazed at its [Amsterdam] riches and from east and west, north and south they come to behold it.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SHIPPING AND COMMERCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Shipbuilding played a key role in the Dutch economy. Amsterdam boasted the best shipbuilders in seventeenth-century Europe. Well-designed Dutch ships could be manned by fewer sailors than those of other countries thus reducing costs.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Over 2,000 Dutch merchant ships crisscrossed the world’s oceans and seas. Their cargoes of spices, silks, cottons and other prized goods comprised over half of Europe’s trade.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE EAST AND WEST INDIES COMPANIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Founded in 1602, the Dutch East Indies Company displaced the Portuguese and gained control of the lucrative East Indian spice trade. The East Indian Company became the forerunner of modern corporations.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Founded in 1621, the Dutch West India Company attempted to exploit the New World’s rich array of resources. Dutch traders extracted fortunes in mahogany and sugar from the coasts of Brazil and Guiana and from the Caribbean islands. In addition, they founded New Amsterdam on the tip of Manhattan Island as a center for the lucrative trade in beaver and otter furs.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>A CENTER OF FINANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Trading profits provided large quantities of capital for investment.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Amsterdam financiers founded the Amsterdam Exchange Bank in 1609. It quickly became the most efficient and reliable bank in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Amsterdam boasted the highest per capita income in Europe. The city’s increasingly prosperous citizens formed the Amsterdam Stock Exchange as a center for trading in commodities.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>CALVINISM AND COMMERCIAL CAPITALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The German sociologist Max Weber published his seminal work <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em> in 1905. Weber argued that Protestantism in general and Calvinism in particular <span id="page_85"/>promoted hard work, an unpretentious lifestyle, and the accumulation and reinvestment of wealth.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Dutch demonstrated the close affinity between Protestantism and the development of commercial capitalism. They avoided ostentation and chose to live frugal lives that included wearing dark clothes and living in substantial but simply furnished homes.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>A Dutch minister complained that merchants in Amsterdam devoted more time to reading business news than listening to sermons: “It would be better if on the Lord’s Day, he gave some account of himself and, instead of reckoning his profits, reckoned up his sins.”</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>KEY CHARACTERISTICS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Dutch Republic was a Protestant nation without an absolute ruler. This made Dutch art very different from the baroque art in Rome and Madrid. Baroque artists working in these cities created works of art designed to glorify the Catholic Church and inspire awe toward the ruling monarchs. In the Dutch Republic, private homes and public buildings replaced cathedrals and castles as the showplaces for works of art.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Lacking commissions from the Catholic Church and royal officials, Dutch artists turned to their nation’s prosperous merchants. As self-made entrepreneurs they wanted to purchase paintings of themselves, their families, their possessions, and their country.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Dutch artists focused on painting individual and group portraits, landscapes, and genre scenes of everyday life.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>DUTCH MASTERS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Rembrandt van Rijn established himself as Amsterdam’s foremost portraitist. <em>The Night Watch</em> is Rembrandt’s most famous painting. In a work of unprecedented vigor, Rembrandt portrayed the members of the Amsterdam Civic Guard assembling for Marie de’ Medici’s state visit. Captain Banning Cocq proudly gestures to his lieutenant, indicating that it is time for the company to march out. A golden natural light illuminates the lieutenant’s lemon-yellow costume and the red sash across Captain Cocq’s chest.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_86"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Frans Hals’ portraits capture each person’s characteristic expression. Few artists have depicted smiles and laughter so convincingly. His works form a portrait gallery of the men and women whose exuberant spirit turned the Dutch Republic into the most prosperous country in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Jan Vermeer’s best-known paintings show interior rooms with one or two figures quietly absorbed in reading, writing, or playing music. His images of composed serenity sparkle with reflected light that pours through an inconspicuous window.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Rachel Ruysch’s meticulous paintings of flowers expressed the Dutch love for their homeland’s natural beauty. Her paintings are admired for their vivid colors and almost photographic depictions of flowers.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>COSTLY WARS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Dutch enjoyed a golden age of commercial prosperity and artistic excellence unequalled in the rest of Europe. However, rivals in England and France coveted the Dutch markets and profits.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Dutch and English fought a series of naval conflicts between 1652 and 1674. Although the Dutch won many battles, they could not fully recover from the crippling costs of these conflicts.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Dutch were also threatened by France’s growing power and territorial ambitions. In 1672, the French successfully occupied three of the seven Dutch provinces. The Dutch finally stopped the invasion by breaking their dikes and flooding vast areas of their country.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_87"/>B.</strong></span><strong>INCREASED ECONOMIC COMPETITION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1651, the English enacted the first of a series of Navigation Acts aimed at the Dutch. The acts mandated that all goods imported into England had to be carried by ships from the exporting countries. The Navigation Acts deliberately excluded Dutch merchants who often served as middlemen in trade exchanges.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The English and French also used tariffs to raise the prices of imported Dutch goods.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Dutch craftsmen found it increasingly difficult to compete with the newly revived French luxury industries. At the same time, England began to mass produce cheap textile products.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>As the Dutch declined, England and France became the dominant European powers.</p>
