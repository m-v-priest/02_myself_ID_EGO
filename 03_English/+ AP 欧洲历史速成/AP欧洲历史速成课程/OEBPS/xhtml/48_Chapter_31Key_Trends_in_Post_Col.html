<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE COLD WAR ERA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the Cold War era in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Cold War appeared to permanently divide Europe into a prosperous, capitalistic West and an impoverished, Communist East.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>However, as described in <a href="47_Chapter_30The_Cold_War__1946_199.html#page_283">Chapter 30</a>, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union ended the Cold War and opened a new era in European and world history.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW POST–COLD WAR ERA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Historians agree that we are now living in a new historic era. However, it is too soon to give the era a definitive name. It is important to remember that most periods are given labels in hindsight. For example, the Interwar Period (described in <a href="44_Chapter_28The_Age_of_Anxiety.html#page_257">Chapters 28</a> and <a href="45_Chapter_29Depression__Dictators.html#page_267">29</a>) got its name only after World War II bracketed World War I.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Although it is too soon to name the Post–Cold War era, we can identify five key trends that are currently shaping European history:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The re-emergence of Russia as a major power.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The economic integration of Europe into the European Union.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The transformation in women’s lives caused by the movement for gender equality.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_300"/><span class="C520">iv.</span>The demographic changes caused by the European baby bust and the mass immigration of people into Europe.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>The impact of revolutionary informational and digital technologies.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>BORIS YELTSIN, 1991–1999</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Despite Gorbachev’s program of <em>perestroika</em>, giant, highly centralized state monopolies still dominated the Russian economy.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Yeltsin was committed to adopting new policies that would place Russia on a firm course to a market economy and a pluralistic political system.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Advised by Western economists, Yeltsin implemented economic “shock therapy” designed to free prices and privatize industry.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Instead of reviving the Russian economy, shock therapy triggered runaway inflation and rampant corruption that allowed a new class of super-rich oligarchs to gain enormous power.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Yeltsin’s problems were further exacerbated by troubles in Chechnya. A tiny republic of one million Muslims, the Chechnyans sought independence from Moscow. Tensions soon escalated into a bloody and costly civil war.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>VLADIMIR PUTIN, 2000–PRESENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The gap between Yeltsin’s economic promises and actual economic performance caused widespread public disillusionment.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In late 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned. His chosen successor, Vladimir Putin, adopted a series of new policies that maintained relatively free markets but strengthened the power of the central government and limited media critics.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Aided by high oil prices, the Russian economy began to grow and its middle class began to expand.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Putin vowed to reassert a strong image in domestic and international affairs. He began by forcefully suppressing the independence movement in Chechnya. Putin then reestablished Russian control over the strategic Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_301"/>5<span class="C504">.</span>Putin’s forceful policies have conveyed an image of strength that symbolizes Russia’s national resurgence. From a long-term historical perspective, Putin revived Russia’s long tradition of authoritarian government.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE ORIGIN OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In the years immediately following World War II, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman (see <a href="47_Chapter_30The_Cold_War__1946_199.html#page_283">Chapter 30</a>) proposed using economic cooperation as a way to end the destructive rivalry between France and Germany. They believed that economic cooperation would build a web of interdependence that would make another war unthinkable.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Monnet and Schuman called for the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The ECSC created a tariff-free zone in coal and steel among France, West Germany, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. These six nations contained most of the coal and steel resources in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>As Schuman predicted, the ECSC became “the first step in the federation of Europe.” The success of the ECSC led its six members to sign the Treaty of Rome, creating the European Economic Community (EEC), also known as the Common Market. The EEC encouraged the free movement of products by eliminating tariffs on all goods.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The EEC proved to be a huge success. During the 1950s and 1960s, all six member nations experienced economic miracles. The EEC’s success prompted Great Britain, Denmark, and Ireland to join the organization in 1973.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>During the 1980s, other European nations applied for membership in the EEC. The original core countries established economic and political criteria that included free markets, democratic politics, and respect for human rights. By 1995, the EEC included 15 nations with a combined population of 395 million people.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE MAASTRICHT TREATY AND THE EUROPEAN UNION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1991, leaders of the EEC countries met in the Dutch city of Maastricht. They adopted the Maastricht Treaty, changing the name of the EEC to the European Union (EU). The treaty <span id="page_302"/>committed the member nations to adopt common production standards, uniform tax rates, a single European currency, and a common EU citizenship.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The EU vindicated Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman’s vision of an integrated European economy that permitted the free movement of goods, labor, capital, and services. On January 1, 2002, twelve of the EU member nations adopted the euro as a common currency. By 2009, 16 EU countries comprised a new “euro-zone.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>EXPANSION TO EASTERN EUROPE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Following the collapse of Communism, virtually all of the Eastern European governments applied for membership in the EU. These nations viewed membership as a source of economic prosperity and a symbol of their return to Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Between 2004 and 2013, the EU added 13 new member nations. The 28 EU nations boasted a combined population of just over 500 million people. The EU now accounts for about one-third of the world’s gross national product (GNP) and about 40 percent of global exports.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Despite its impressive record of success, the EU faces formidable problems. For example, can a union of 28 sovereign countries develop a common identity and political cohesion?</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Developments in Greece tested the unity of the Euro-zone nations. Following its admission into the EU, Greece began to develop record trade and budget deficits. A deep recession that began in the United States in 2008 and then spread to Europe exacerbated these problems. As Greece fell into a severe recession, European banks loaned it massive bailout funds that delayed, but did not solve, the Greek debt crisis.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Developments in Great Britain also posed a serious challenge to the long-term future of the European Union. In a referendum held in June 2016, “Brexit” supporters who wanted Britain to “exit” the EU won a surprising victory. Although Londoners opposed Brexit, older voters in the surrounding countryside expressed anger that participation in the EU created open borders that encouraged a rising tide of immigration into Great Britain. Britain’s anticipated departure in 2020 poses risks for the British economy and uncertainty for the continuing strength of the EU.</p>

</table>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CHANGING PATTERNS OF MARRIAGE AND CHILDBEARING</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the years immediately following World War II, many women left their wartime jobs and resumed their traditional roles as wives and mothers. Birthrates began to rise, creating the postwar “baby boom.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>These traditional trends did not last. Birthrates, and thus the size of families, began to decline by the middle of the 1960s.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>As birth rates declined, European women began to marry at an early age. The combination of early marriage and small family size meant that a new generation of young married women began to enter the workforce.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>At the same time, Europe’s booming postwar economy increased the demand for labor. The shift to white-collar service industries in government, education, and health care opened new opportunities for women.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR AND BETTY FRIEDAN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>As more and more women entered the workforce, they began to encounter long-established patterns of discrimination in salary and working conditions. The combination of rising employment and entrenched patterns of job discrimination created a growing sense of injustice among many women.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The French author Simone de Beauvoir was the first European woman to publicly challenge the status quo. In her seminal book, <em>The Second Sex</em>, de Beauvoir argued that a male-dominated European society had forced women into dependent lives of housework and childbearing that denied them independent careers and creative fulfillment. She emphasized that women could only achieve genuine autonomy by escaping from their traditional inferior roles. De Beauvoir’s book became a cornerstone of feminist theory.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>De Beauvoir’s argument that society trapped middle-class women in unfulfilling domestic roles had a profound influence on American housewife Betty Friedan. A college-educated journalist and mother of three children, Friedan became increasingly frustrated trying to fulfill the traditional role of “ideal housewife and mother.” Friedan responded to “the problem that has no name” by publishing <em>The Feminist Mystique</em>. Released in 1963, this <span id="page_304"/>landmark book criticized traditional gender roles and forcefully argued that women faced patterns of discrimination that denied them equality with men. <em>The Feminist Mystique</em> became an international best-seller that transformed Friedan into a feminist leader. In 1966, she founded the National Organization for Women (NOW), whose stated goal was to take “action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society <em>now</em>.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the women’s movement focused on overturning legal inequalities, particularly women’s suffrage. Led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst, British women won the right to vote in 1918. By the end of World War II, European women received the suffrage in every country except Switzerland. The Swiss finally granted all of their female citizens the right to vote in 1991.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The suffrage did not change women’s salaries. During the 1960s, British women earned only 60 percent of men’s wages, while in France the corresponding figure was just 50 percent.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Continuing economic inequality prompted women to form a broad-based feminist movement focused on winning gender equality.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>During the last three decades of the twentieth century, women activists successfully fought for “equal pay for equal work,” more generous maternity leave, and affordable day care. The movement also strove to liberalize divorce laws and legalize abortion.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The accomplishments of the women’s movement inspired other groups including gay men, lesbian women, and people with physical disabilities to organize and call for an end to legal discrimination and social harassment.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>WOMEN AND THE GREEN MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>As more and more women became social activists, they broadened their efforts to include a variety of new issues.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>West German women played a leading role in the formation of the Green Party. Led by Petra Kelly, the Green movement fought to protect the environment and to defend human rights and equality. In 1987, the Green Party elected 42 delegates to the West German parliament.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE BABY BUST</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>A birth rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to maintain a stable population.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Europe’s postwar baby boom turned into a baby bust as birth rates began to steadily decline. By 2006, the European birth rate stood at just 1.4 children per woman.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The demographic impact of the baby bust can be vividly seen in Germany. If present trends continue, the German population will shrink from 82 million people in 2001 to just 62 million in 2050.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>If it continues, the baby bust will produce serious long-term consequences. As Europe’s population declines, it will also age. As a result, health care costs will sharply rise. In addition, a shrinking labor force will have to support rising social security taxes.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Demographers have identified a number of possible causes for the baby bust. Following World War II, European women married early, had children and then entered the labor force. An ever-increasing number of women chose not to have more children as they concentrated their energies on careers. The more educated and successful women often limited their family size to just one child.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>GUEST WORKERS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Europe’s booming postwar economy and declining birth rate produced a severe labor shortage.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The collapse of the colonial system created a vast pool of unskilled laborers eager to begin new lives.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_306"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>During the 1960s and 1970s, millions of manual laborers from former British, French, Dutch, and Portuguese colonies entered Europe as “guest workers.”</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Europe now has an estimated 18 million foreign resident workers. Many guest workers and their families are staying in their host countries.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>LEGAL AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Since the fall of Communism, poverty, political persecutions, and civil wars have combined to create waves of legal and illegal immigrants seeking opportunity and safety.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The arrival of millions of immigrants is straining social services throughout Europe. It is also alarming native residents who feel that immigrants threaten their jobs and undermine national unity.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The twenty-first century is currently witnessing a significant migration of Muslims into Europe. If this trend continues, the Muslim population in Europe will rise from about 15 million in 2006 to 30 million in 2025.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>At the end of 2015, a tidal wave of refugees from Syria was exacerbating tensions as Europe struggled to cope with the largest refugee crisis since World War II.</p>

<p class="C460"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>BIG SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Before World War II, theoretical science and sophisticated engineering were largely separated.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_307"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>During World War II, governments led by the United States, Great Britain, and Germany combined science and technology to produce new weapons. For example, British scientists developed radar, German scientists developed jet aircraft, and American scientists developed the atomic bomb.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The unprecedented combination of theoretical science and complex engineering under government sponsorship is called “Big Science.”</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>During the Cold War, Big Science produced such significant technological breakthroughs as rockets, nuclear submarines, and spy satellites.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The space race between the United States and the Soviet Union provided a dramatic illustration of a Big Science project. In 1957, the Soviet Union stunned the United States by using long-range rockets to launch the first satellite, <em>Sputnik</em>, into orbit around the Earth. Four years later, the Soviet Union achieved another space milestone by successfully placing a cosmonaut into orbit. Galvanized by these Soviet firsts, the United States organized the Apollo Project to overtake the Russians by placing a man on the moon.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE INFORMATION AGE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the nineteenth century, innovations in the textile industry and the invention of the railroad revolutionized European society and everyday life. The late twentieth century and early twenty-first century have also witnessed revolutionary changes that are ushering in the birth of a transformative new Information Age.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Television signaled the birth of a new global age of shared information and images. Between the mid-1950s and mid-1970s, Europeans adopted television as an integral part of their daily lives. Television exerted a powerful cultural and political impact by shaping public attitudes toward entertainment, commercial products, national leaders, and global events.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The computer provides another example of how the alliance of science and technology is reshaping life in the new Information Age. Early computers were huge, expensive machines that relied on thousands of vacuum tubes. The development of tiny but powerful silicon chips dramatically shrank the size and cost of computers while vastly increasing their power. During the 1980s and 1990s, new generations of personal computers changed the pace and patterns of work and leisure.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_308"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE DIGITAL WORLD</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the late 1990s, ongoing advances in computer and electronics ushered in a digital revolution centered around the internet and mobile phones.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>By 2010, about one-third of the world’s population was using the internet to buy goods, learn news, and connect with friends. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube became integral parts of daily life in the new digital world.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Age of Discovery in the sixteenth century witnessed the beginning of the historic process of globalization. The digital revolution is dramatically accelerating this process. Today labor, capital, ideas, services, and goods are all interconnected into complex and fast-moving social and economic webs.</p>
