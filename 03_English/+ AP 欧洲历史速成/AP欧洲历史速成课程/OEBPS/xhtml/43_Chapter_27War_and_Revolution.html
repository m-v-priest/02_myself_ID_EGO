<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>GERMANY AND THE NEW BALANCE OF POWER</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Germany’s industrial capacity, population, and military power all dramatically increased. In 1900, Germany produced more steel than Great Britain and France combined. Germany’s population increased from 41 million in 1871 to 64 million in 1910. In contrast, France had just 40 million people in 1910.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>European leaders from Cardinal Richelieu (see <a href="23_Chapter_12Absolutism_in_Western.html#page_99">Chapter 12</a>) to Prince Klemens von Metternich (see <a href="33_Chapter_20Restoration_and_Romant.html#page_171">Chapter 20</a>) had feared a united Germany. Their fears now became a reality. As Germany’s power surged, its leaders demanded respect and a new “place in the sun.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>BISMARCK’S NETWORK OF ALLIANCES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The French were humiliated by their defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and embittered by their loss of Alsace-Lorraine.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In an attempt to isolate France, Bismarck formed a military alliance with Austria-Hungary in 1879. Three years later, Italy joined these two countries, thus forming the Triple Alliance.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1887, Bismarck took yet another ally away from France by signing a treaty with Russia.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>WILLIAM II’S AGGRESSIVE POLICIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1890, Kaiser William II forced Bismarck to resign.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>William II promptly set Germany on a new course by letting the treaty of friendship with Russia lapse.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_248"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>William II then challenged Britain’s long-standing naval supremacy by embarking on an expensive program of naval expansion that poisoned relations between the two countries.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE FORMATION OF THE TRIPLE ENTENTE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>France immediately offered Russia financial investments and diplomatic friendship. The two nations signed a Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Alarmed by Germany’s growing naval power, Britain abandoned its policy of “splendid isolation.” In 1904, Britain concluded a series of agreements with France collectively called the Entente Cordiale. With French support, the British concluded a similar agreement with Russia, thus forming the Triple Entente.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Germany tested the Anglo-French entente by challenging France’s plan to dominate Morocco. However, Germany’s belligerent actions only served to draw France and Britain closer together.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Two rival alliances now confronted each other. A dispute between any two powers could easily escalate into a major war.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE BALKAN POWDER KEG</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>As the power of the Ottoman Empire receded, the Balkan Peninsula became a powder keg of competing interests.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>With the exception of the Greeks and the Romanians, most of the Balkan population spoke the same Slavic language. Many Slavs embraced Pan-Slavism, a nationalist movement to unite all Slavic peoples.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Bismarck recognized the potential danger of nationalist aspirations in the Balkans. At the 1878 Congress of Berlin, he tried to reduce tensions by supporting Serbian independence and Austria-Hungary’s right to “occupy and administer” Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The newly independent nation of Serbia quickly became the leader of the Pan-Slavic movement. Serbian leaders hoped to unite the Slavs in the same way Piedmont had united the Italians and Prussia the Germans.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Austria felt threatened by the growth of Slavic nationalism within its borders and across the Balkans. In 1908, the Austrians enraged the Serbs by annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_249"/>6<span class="C504">.</span>Serbian nationalism threatened Austria. At the same time, it offered Slavic Russia an opportunity to advance its interests in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>Russia and Austria-Hungary were thus on a collision course in the Balkans. As one Balkan crisis followed another, Europe teetered on the brink of war.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>THE OUTBREAK OF WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>On June 28, 1914, a 19-year-old Slav nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, assassinated Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the Austrian throne.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The assassination set in motion a sequence of events that plunged Europe into war. In August 1914, millions of soldiers marched off to battle, convinced the war would be over in a few weeks.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE SCHLIEFFEN PLAN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Germany faced the daunting task of simultaneously fighting France on its western border and Russia along a lengthy eastern front.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In order to prevent a two-front war, General Alfred von Schlieffen drew up a master plan calling for an all-out attack against France. The Schlieffen Plan gambled that France could be knocked out of the war before Russia had a chance to fully mobilize its forces.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>A lightning attack on France meant invading neutral Belgium.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Germany’s unprovoked attack on Belgium outraged Britain. On August 4, 1914, Britain declared war on Germany.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_250"/>B.</strong></span><strong>STALEMATE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Schlieffen Plan narrowly failed, making a quick victory impossible.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Both sides now constructed an elaborate system of trenches stretching more than 600 miles from the English Channel to the Swiss border.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Trench warfare produced a stalemate that lasted about four years and claimed unprecedented casualties.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE HOME FRONT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Total war</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>When it became clear that the war would not be over quickly, governments mobilized all human and industrial resources in order to wage total war.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Governments tightly controlled the news and used propaganda to rally public morale and arouse hatred of the enemy.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The role of women</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>As more and more men went to war, millions of women replaced them in factories, offices, and shops. World War I marked the first time that the employment of women was essential to a sustained war effort.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In the decade prior to World War I, British women led by Emmeline Pankhurst waged an aggressive campaign for greater political and social rights. During the war, Pankhurst called a halt to militant suffrage activities, urging women to focus on contributing to the war effort.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>In 1918, Parliament granted the suffrage to women over the age of 30.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong><em>ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT</em></strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span><em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> is a war novel written by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Remarque vividly described the senseless slaughter and suffering endured by soldiers on the Western Front.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE END OF ROMANOV RULE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The poorly equipped Russian army was no match for the German war machine. By 1917, more than 7 million Russian soldiers had been killed, wounded, or taken prisoner.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Nicholas II proved to be an inept ruler. As an all-powerful autocrat, he was oblivious to “public opinion” and to the pressing need to withdraw from World War I. Instead, Russian battlefield losses mounted and shortages of food worsened. Nicholas moved his headquarters to the front in a futile attempt to rally his troops.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In early 1917, food shortages in Petrograd (formerly St. Petersburg) led to spontaneous demonstrations and strikes.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Nicholas ordered his troops to restore order, but the soldiers refused and instead supported the demonstrators. On March 12, 1917, Nicholas II abdicated, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>A provisional government led by Alexander Kerensky replaced the tsar.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>As a result of tsarist political oppression, Kerensky inherited a government with no viable democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Despite mounting losses, the provisional government continued the war against Germany. This fateful decision to pursue an unpopular war weakened the provisional government and played a key role in its demise.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>VLADIMIR LENIN AND THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>While the Russian army was falling apart, the Germans helped Lenin return to Petrograd. Lenin arrived at the Finland Station on April 3, 1917, and promptly urged his followers to overthrow the provisional government.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Lenin’s key ideas</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Lenin denounced the extreme economic inequalities under the tsarist regime. He eschewed reform, arguing that capitalism could only be destroyed by class conflict.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_252"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>Lenin insisted that a communist revolution was possible in a nonindustrialized country such as Russia.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Lenin argued that Russia’s relatively small working class could not develop a revolutionary class consciousness. Instead, leadership would have to come from a highly disciplined group of professional revolutionaries.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Lenin’s slogan of “Peace, Land, and Bread” captured the popular imagination and enabled the Bolsheviks to win widespread popular support.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Lenin sensed that it was time to act. “History will not forgive us,” Lenin wrote, “if we do not seize power now.” On the night of November 6, 1917, the Bolsheviks occupied most government buildings. The next day Lenin proclaimed the establishment of a new Bolshevik government.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE TREATY OF BREST-LITOVSK</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Lenin realized that the survival of the Bolshevik regime depended upon ending the war with Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In March 1918, the Bolsheviks reluctantly agreed to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Under the terms of this treaty, Russia lost a quarter of its European territory and a third of its population.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>It is important to note that Russia later repudiated the treaty, and it was declared null and void by the Allies.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>CIVIL WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>By the summer of 1918, several “White” armies attempted to overthrow the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Leon Trotsky, the Bolsheviks responded by forming a highly disciplined Red Army.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The civil war between the Whites and the Reds lasted from 1918 to 1920. The divided and poorly led Whites lost to the better-organized Red Army.</p>

<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Reinforced by newly arrived American troops, the British and French halted the German offensive.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Realizing that defeat was imminent, William II abdicated his throne and Germany became a republic. Two days later, on November 11, 1918, World War I came to an end.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE FOURTEEN POINTS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>President Woodrow Wilson became the spokesman for a just and lasting peace.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Wilson’s Fourteen Points included a call for the following:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Open diplomacy</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Freedom of the seas</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C520">vi.</span>National self-determination for oppressed minority groups</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C539">vii.</span>Creation of a “general association of nations” to preserve the peace and security of its members</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Wilson’s idealistic proposals were undermined by secret treaties and by a desire to punish Germany.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Although nearly 30 countries were represented, Great Britain, France, and the United States made the major decisions.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Germany and Austria-Hungary were not allowed to attend the conference.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Russia, which had suffered the greatest loss of life, was in the midst of a civil war and was not invited to attend the conference.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_254"/>D.</strong></span><strong>THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Germany lost 13 percent of its land, including Alsace-Lorraine.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Germany’s territories in Africa and the Pacific were given as mandates to Britain, France, and Japan. A mandate was a territory that was administered on behalf of the League of Nations.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Poland once again became an independent nation. The new Poland received a large strip of German land called the Polish Corridor. This strip cut off East Prussia from the rest of Germany and gave Poland access to the sea.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Germany’s army was limited to 100,000 men and forbidden to have artillery, aircraft, or submarines.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The east bank of the Rhine River was to be demilitarized, and the Allies were to have the right to occupy the Rhineland for 15 years.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Germany was declared guilty of starting the war and forced to pay huge payments called reparations.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>The Allies created a League of Nations to discuss and settle disputes without resorting to war.</p>
<p class="C515">8<span class="C504">.</span>The final signing ceremony took place in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, the same room in which Bismarck’s German empire had been proclaimed in 1871.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Austria-Hungary was dissolved and the Habsburg monarchy eliminated. Austria and Hungary became separate states. In addition, territories from Austria-Hungary were given to the newly created states of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Serbs dominated Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Finland and the three Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—emerged from the tsarist empire.</p>
