<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MARTIN LUTHER’S PERSONAL QUEST FOR SALVATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Luther’s early life was dominated by a private struggle to find the key to personal salvation.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Catholic Church taught that salvation could be achieved by both good works and faith. For many long years, Luther struggled to follow this dual path to salvation. However, he was overwhelmed by a deep sense of personal guilt.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>After many years of study, Luther began to examine St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans. One evening, Luther read Paul’s admonition that “the just shall be saved by faith.”</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Luther’s arduous years of study prepared him for this fateful moment. At last he understood that salvation was a gift freely given by God.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NINETY-FIVE THESES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Luther’s spiritual journey seemed to culminate in a personal revelation. But then historic events intersected with his life.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1517, Luther witnessed Johann Tetzel selling indulgences near Wittenberg. In Luther’s time, an indulgence was a certificate granted by the pope in return for the payment of a fee to the church. The certificate stated that the soul of the dead relative or friend of the purchaser would have his time in purgatory reduced by many years or canceled altogether.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Part of the income from the indulgences sold by Tetzel was destined for Rome to help pay for the construction of the new St. Peter’s Basilica.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_56"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>Tetzel’s aggressive marketing tactics appalled Luther. He believed that salvation could not be sold by the pope; it was a free gift given by God.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>On October 31, 1517, Luther dramatically nailed his Ninety-five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. Aided by the printing press, Luther’s defiant challenge was soon disseminated across Europe. Within a short time, he became the most famous and controversial person in Europe.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>LUTHER’S KEY BELIEFS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Salvation is achieved by faith alone.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Catholic Church had long taught that salvation could be achieved by both faith and good works.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Luther insisted that faith was the only path to salvation.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Bible is the only valid authority for Christian life.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Catholic Church taught that authority rests in both the Bible and the traditional teachings of the church.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Luther insisted that all church teachings should be based on the Word of God as revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Based upon his study of the Bible, Luther argued that Christ established just two sacraments: baptism and the Eucharist or Holy Communion. Luther thus rejected the Catholic teaching that there were seven sacraments.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The church consists of a priesthood of all believers.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Roman Catholic Church was a hierarchical organization led by the pope.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Luther insisted that because all Christians are spiritually equal, the church consists of the entire community of the Christian faithful.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>All vocations have equal merit.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Catholic Church taught that the monastic life was superior to the secular life.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Luther rejected this belief, arguing that all honest work has equal merit. Each person should serve God in his or her own individual calling.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Luther abolished monasteries and convents. He declared that the clergy should marry.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_57"/>D.</strong></span><strong>THE GERMAN PEASANTS’ WAR, 1525</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Causes</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>German peasants originally supported Luther. They heard his message as one that promised freedom from oppression by the landlords and the clergy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Complaints that nobles had seized village common lands and imposed exorbitant rents soon escalated to open attacks on monasteries, castles, and prosperous farms.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Luther’s response</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The peasants believed Luther would support them. Luther, however, believed that Christians ought to obey their rulers—even unjust rulers—and that rebellion against the state was always wrong and must be crushed.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Horrified at the prospect of a bloody revolution, Luther urged the German nobility to crush the rebels.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Consequences</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The German Peasants’ War of 1525 strengthened the authority of the German nobility.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Lutheranism became closely allied with the established political order controlled by the German nobility.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>LUTHER AND THE ROLE OF CHRISTIAN WOMEN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The elimination of monasteries and convents was a key factor in changing the role of sixteenth-century women.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Luther believed that Christian women should strive to be models of obedience and Christian charity.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_58"/>F.</strong></span><strong>THE SPREAD OF LUTHERANISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Lutheranism became the dominant religion in northern and eastern Germany. It is important to remember that most of southern Germany, Austria, and the Rhineland remained Roman Catholic.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Lutheranism became the predominant religion in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>G.</strong></span><strong>THE PEACE OF AUGSBURG, 1555</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Between 1546 and 1555, a religious civil war between Catholics led by Charles V and Protestants led by German princes tore Germany apart. It is important to note that the Catholic king of France supported the Protestant nobles. This is an example of the long-standing French policy of maintaining a divided Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Peace of Augsburg ended the civil war. The settlement gave each German prince the right to determine the religion of his state, either Roman Catholic or Lutheran. The Peace of Augsburg did not provide for the recognition of Calvinists and other religious minorities.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>H.</strong></span><strong>WAS LUTHER A REVOLUTIONARY OR A CONSERVATIVE?</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Luther was a religious revolutionary.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Luther’s core beliefs went well beyond attempting to reform the Roman Catholic Church. His doctrines of justification by faith, priesthood of all believers, and the Bible as the sole authority marked a major departure from long-standing Catholic principles.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Luther’s revolutionary actions included abolishing monasteries, reducing the number of sacraments, encouraging priests to marry, and repudiating the pope’s authority to interpret the Bible.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Luther’s belief that everyone should read the Bible led to the encouragement of education and the growth of literacy.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Luther was a political conservative.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Luther insisted that Christians owed obedience to established authority. He maintained that religious reform should not affect the political status quo, except for its impact on the break with the papacy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_59"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>Luther gave his support to the German nobility as they brutally suppressed the peasant rebellion.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>JOHN CALVIN’S KEY BELIEFS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Calvin’s doctrines are clearly and systematically explained in his landmark book, <em>The Institutes of the Christian Religion</em>.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Calvin asserted that while God is just, perfect, and omnipotent, humans are corrupt, weak, and insignificant.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Since men and women are by nature sinful, they cannot actively work to achieve salvation. Because God is all-knowing, he has “determined, both whom he would admit to salvation and whom he would condemn to destruction.” This “terrible decree” constitutes the theological principle called predestination.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>By God’s grace, a very few people will be saved from sin. Calvin called these people the “elect.”</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Calvin taught that the elect have a duty to rule society so as to glorify God. The ideal government should therefore be a theocracy in which church leaders dominate civil authorities.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Calvin and Luther agreed on many fundamental points of theology. However, they disagreed on the emphasis placed upon predestination and the relationship between church and civil authorities. While Luther believed that the church should be subordinated to the state, Calvin stressed that the elect have a duty to Christianize the state.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>GENEVA, “CITY OF SAINTS”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1541, Protestants in Geneva, Switzerland, asked Calvin to transform their city into a model Christian community.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Calvin and his followers regulated all aspects of life in Geneva. They suppressed frivolous activities such as playing cards, dancing, and attending the theater. At the same time, they strictly enforced a high standard of morality that included regular church attendance.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_60"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SPREAD OF CALVINISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Protestant reformers from France, England, and Scotland hailed Calvin’s Geneva as “the most perfect school of Christ since the days of the Apostles.” Geneva thus became both the center of Calvin’s reformed church and a compelling model for other Protestant leaders.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In the late 1550s, John Knox brought Calvinism to Scotland. Within a decade, the Presbyterian Church founded by Knox and his followers became the basis for Scotland’s established religion.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Calvinism soon spread to France where followers were called Huguenots. The new faith had particular appeal to French nobles and members of the middle class many of whom saw themselves as members of the elect.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Calvinists also founded Puritan churches in England and later in New England.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The “Defender of the Faith”</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Henry VIII was a devout Catholic who detested Luther.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Henry wrote a pamphlet calling Luther “a great limb of the Devil.” Impressed by Henry’s loyalty, the pope gave him a special title, “Defender of the Faith.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The problem of succession</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Henry’s political needs proved more important than his loyalty to the pope.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Since Henry was only the second king of the Tudor dynasty, he was determined to have a male heir. When his wife, Catherine of Aragon, failed to give birth to a son, Henry asked Pope Clement VII to annul the marriage.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The pope would normally have granted Henry’s request. However, Catherine of Aragon was the aunt of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. At the time of Henry’s request, Charles’s armies controlled Rome. Caught between the plea of a distant English king and the immediate presence of a <span id="page_61"/>powerful Holy Roman emperor, the pope delayed and finally refused to annul Henry’s marriage.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Act of Supremacy, 1534</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Thwarted by the pope, Henry turned to a radical solution to solve his marriage problem.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In 1533, Henry defied the pope, secretly married Anne Boleyn, and annulled his marriage to Catherine.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The following year, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy. This landmark act declared the English king to be the “Protector and Only Supreme Head of the Church and Clergy of England.”</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Although Henry VIII rejected papal supremacy, he remained a devout Catholic. In 1539, Parliament approved the Six Articles defining the doctrine of the English Church. With the sole exception of papal supremacy, the Six Articles reaffirmed Catholic teachings while rejecting Protestant beliefs.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Dissolution of the monasteries</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Beginning in 1536, Parliament passed acts closing all English monasteries and seizing their lands.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Henry sold much of the land to nobles and to members of England’s increasingly prosperous merchant class.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Enriched by the monastic lands, these groups became loyal supporters of the Tudor dynasty.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: HENRY VIII AND MARTIN LUTHER</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>At first glance, Henry VIII and Martin Luther had very little in common. Henry rejected Luther’s core doctrines, and the two exchanged derisive pamphlets filled with insults. Guided by his faith, Luther wanted to reform and then change the Catholic Church. Guided by his dynastic interests, Henry wanted a male heir in order to avoid a potentially bloody succession.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Henry VIII and Martin Luther had very different religious beliefs and motives. Nonetheless, they shared similar political attitudes. Both believed that the church should be subordinate to the state. Both Henry VIII and Martin Luther rejected papal authority. In addition, both followed policies intended to strengthen the nobility. As we have seen, Luther supported the nobility by encouraging them to suppress the rebellious peasants. Henry supported the nobility by allowing them to purchase monastic lands.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_62"/>C.</strong></span><strong>ELIZABETH I (REIGNED 1558–1603)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Religious issues</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Elizabeth I inherited a difficult religious problem. Since Henry VIII’s break with Rome in 1534, royal religious policy had changed direction several times.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Protestants gained strength under Edward VI (reigned 1547–1553). Catholics experienced a renewal under Mary (reigned 1553–1558).</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Elizabethan Settlement</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Elizabeth was a politique who placed political necessities above her personal beliefs. She therefore strove to find a middle course that moderate Catholics and moderate Protestants would accept.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Elizabethan Settlement restored the Church of England. Also known as the Anglican Church, the Church of England allowed priests to marry and to conduct sermons in English. However, the Church of England retained archbishops and bishops who wore elaborate robes and conducted services that remained formal and traditional.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Although Protestant in tone, the Church of England instituted dogmas that were deliberately broad and often ambiguous.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: ISABELLA OF SPAIN AND ELIZABETH I OF ENGLAND</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Both Queen Isabella of Spain and Queen Elizabeth I of England shared the goal of ruling over a united country. However, they followed dramatically different religious policies to achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Isabella was a devout Roman Catholic who decreed that in a Christian state, there could be only “one king, one law, one faith.” She revived the Inquisition, conquered Muslim-controlled Grenada, and forced Jews and Muslims to become Christians or leave Spain. Her actions created religious unity, but at the price of harming Spain’s economy.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Elizabeth was a politique. Although raised a Protestant, her religious views are largely unknown. What mattered most to Elizabeth was not the religious beliefs of her subjects, but their loyalty. She wanted to avoid destructive religious civil wars. It was not her intention, she said, “to pry windows into men’s souls.” Elizabeth’s reign marked the beginning of a cultural golden age and a period of sustained economic growth and prosperity.</p>

<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Anabaptists rejected secular agreements. For example, they refused to pay taxes, take civil oaths, hold public offices, or serve in the military.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists all condemned Anabaptist leaders as radicals.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Modern historians have labeled Thomas Münzer a “left wing” Anabaptist leader because he advocated the overthrow of the existing political and social order. Münzer was executed in 1525.</p>
