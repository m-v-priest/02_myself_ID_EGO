<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The great powers of Europe included Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Spain, Holland, Poland, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire were no longer considered great powers.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The great powers fought limited wars:</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Pragmatic Sanction guaranteed Maria Theresa’s (reigned 1740–1780) right to inherit the Habsburg throne and territories.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Frederick the Great ignored the Pragmatic Sanction and seized Silesia. Located on the northeastern frontier of Bohemia, Silesia boasted a million people, a prosperous linen industry, and rich deposits of iron ore.</p>

<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Frederick retained control of Silesia, thus confirming Prussia’s status as a great power and chief rival of Austria in German affairs.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The English restored Louisbourg to France, and the French gave Madras back to England.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_136"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE DIPLOMATIC REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Austrian chancellor, Count Kaunitz, vowed to recover Silesia.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Kaunitz successfully formed a coalition that included France, Austria, and Russia. One consequence of this new alliance was the marriage of Marie Antoinette, daughter of Maria Theresa, to the future Louis XVI of France.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>England then formed an alliance with Prussia to implement its policy of maintaining a balance of power on the continent.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Note that this diplomatic revolution did not change the basic rivalries between England and France, and Austria and Prussia.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE TREATY OF PARIS, 1763</strong></p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE CONCEPT OF ENLIGHTENED DESPOTISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The philosophes urged Europe’s absolute rulers to use their power for the good of the people.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Enlightened despots would combat ignorance and superstition by eliminating irrational customs, promoting religious toleration, reforming legal codes, and supporting education.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>It is important to note that the philosophes did not support democracy. Like Thomas Hobbes (see <a href="22_Chapter_11England__The_Emergence.html#page_89">Chapter 11</a>), they believed that the people could not be trusted with self-government.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>George III of England (reigned 1760–1820) and Louis XV of France (reigned 1715–1774) had little or no interest in either the philosophes or the concept of enlightened despotism. Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, and Joseph II of Austria were Europe’s best-known enlightened despots.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CATHERINE THE GREAT (REIGNED 1762–1796)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Enlightened reforms</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Corresponded with Voltaire and invited Denis Diderot to visit her court</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Supported Russia’s first private printing presses</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Provided formal education for the daughters of the nobility</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Restricted the practice of torture</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>Allowed limited religious toleration to Jews</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">vi.</span>Convened a legislative commission to draft a new enlightened law code. However, the nobles refused to concede any of their privileges and very little was accomplished.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_138"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Pugachev’s Rebellion</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>From 1773 to 1775, a Cossack soldier named Emelian Pugachev led a dangerous uprising of serfs living along the Volga River. The rebellion finally ended when Pugachev was captured, tortured, and executed.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Pugachev’s Rebellion marked the end of Catherine’s program of enlightened reforms.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Determined to prevent any future rebellions, Catherine gave the nobles additional privileges and absolute power over their estates and serfs.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Territorial expansion</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Catherine ignored the philosophes’ arguments against war. During her reign, Russia gained territory at the expense of the Ottoman Empire and Poland.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Catherine’s armies defeated the Ottomans and gained control over the Crimean Peninsula and most of the northern shore of the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Catherine, along with Prussia and Austria, annexed Polish territory in a series of partitions that took place in 1772, 1793, and 1795. As a result of these partitions, Poland disappeared as an independent nation<em/>.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Overall evaluation</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Catherine attempted to strengthen Russia by streamlining state bureaucracies, reforming local governments, and promoting measures to encourage economic growth.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Catherine enjoyed the favorable publicity she received from her contacts with leading philosophes. However, she was not prepared to risk radical reform.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Catherine reacted negatively to the French Revolution. For example, she banned books by the philosophes and exiled critics to Siberia.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>FREDERICK THE GREAT (REIGNED 1740–1786)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Enlightened reforms</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Called himself “the first servant of the state”</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Prepared a unified national code of law</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>Abolished the use of torture except for treason and murder</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">vi.</span>Encouraged Huguenots from France and Jews from Poland to immigrate to Prussia</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Junkers and serfs</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>A firm believer in social order, Frederick strengthened the Junkers’ privileges.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Junkers retained full control over their serfs.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: PETER THE GREAT AND FREDERICK THE GREAT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Goals</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Both Peter the Great (see <a href="21_Chapter_10The_Dutch_Golden_Age.html#page_83">Chapter 10</a>) and Frederick the Great were determined to transform their countries into great powers.</p>

<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Policies</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Both rulers waged wars to conquer strategic territory.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Peter’s victory over Sweden enabled Russia to take over warm-water outlets and become the leading Baltic power. Frederick’s victory over Austria enabled Prussia to take control over Silesia and become a leading German power.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Both rulers imported Western ideas. Peter took the unprecedented step of visiting Western Europe. His program of westernization opened Russia to new ideas, crops, and technologies. Frederick took the unprecedented step of inviting Voltaire to live in Prussia. His program of enlightened despotism opened Prussia to religious toleration, scientific agriculture, and a new code of laws.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Both rulers instituted changes that affected only the top layers of their societies. The serfs in both Russia and Prussia remained tied to the land and completely dominated by nobles.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_140"/>E.</strong></span><strong>JOSEPH II (REIGNED 1780–1790)</strong></p>
