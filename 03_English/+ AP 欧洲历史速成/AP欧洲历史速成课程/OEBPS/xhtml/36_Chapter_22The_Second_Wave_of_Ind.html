<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>NEW INDUSTRIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Bessemer process increased steel production while reducing costs. By 1900, steel had replaced iron in machinery, ships, railroad tracks, and building construction. For example, steel girders replaced stone and iron as the supports for buildings. Steel frames enabled architects to build the first “cloud scrapers.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Germany, the chemical industry grew rapidly. New products included soaps, dyes, fertilizers, and explosives.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NEW SOURCES OF POWER</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Coal and steam gave way to electricity, oil, and gasoline in powering even more intricate machinery.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Electricity proved to be especially versatile. It lit homes and powered everything from industrial machinery to the new streetcars.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>NEW FORMS OF COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPORTATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>First demonstrated by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, the telephone quickly became an essential part of modern life. The telephone linked families and friends while also playing a key role in speeding business transactions.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The invention of the internal combustion engine enabled mechanics to build gasoline-powered automobiles.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>NEW FORMS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Business enterprises became larger and more powerful.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_190"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Business leaders formed trusts in the United States, amalgamations in Great Britain, and cartels in Germany to control production, distribution, and price levels.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Capitalists such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Alfred Krupp, and Alfred Nobel wielded enormous economic power and political influence.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>NEW INDUSTRIAL POWERS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Worldwide industrial production more than tripled between 1870 and 1914. Great Britain, Germany, and the United States dominated the world economy. In 1913, these three nations produced two-thirds of the world’s manufactured goods.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Although Great Britain continued to be a major industrial power, its rate of growth slowed. Germany and the United States emerged as new and formidable industrial rivals.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Germany’s emergence as Europe’s leading industrial power altered the European balance of power, posing a challenge to Great Britain’s political and economic leadership.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>POPULATION GROWTH</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>As a result of falling death rates and improved agricultural and industrial production, Europe’s population rose from 193 million in 1800 to 423 million in 1900.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1900, Europeans comprised 24 percent of the world’s population. The figure today is just 12 percent.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>URBANIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Large-scale urbanization had been virtually unknown in Europe before the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The factory system transformed many small towns into crowded cities, For example, between 1760 and 1850, the population of Manchester, England, surged from 45,000 to 300,000.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The sudden influx of people created slums where entire families lived in a single dark room.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_191"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>In 1914, the urban population reached 80 percent in Britain, 60 percent in Germany, and 45 percent in France.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE FACTORY SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The factory was a place where large numbers of workers used machines to manufacture goods.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>As the factory system spread, the putting-out system disappeared.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The factory system created two self-conscious social classes, the working class or proletariat and the middle class or bourgeoisie.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>WORKING-CLASS MISERY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Industrial Revolution brought misery and poverty to the growing urban working class.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Factory workers often labored on dangerous machines for 14 hours a day.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The demand for cheap labor led to the widespread employment of women and young children.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Workers had no health insurance and little job security.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The plight of the working class, including child labor and gender exploitation, dominated social and political issues during the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MIDDLE-CLASS PROSPERITY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The middle classes, or bourgeoisie, enjoyed unprecedented prosperity, political power, and leisure time.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The <em>haute bourgeoisie</em> included wealthy bankers, merchants, and industrialists.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The <em>petite bourgeoisie</em> included shopkeepers, skilled artisans, professional men, and the clergy.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>POLITICAL LIBERALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Liberals believed in freedom of thought, religion, and trade. They also stressed freedom from restrictions and injustices of the Old Regime.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In his seminal essay <em>On Liberty</em>, the British social philosopher John Stuart Mill supported only the most necessary interference by the government in the affairs of the individual.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Liberals favored a limited democracy with property qualifications for voting and holding office.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMIC LIBERALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Liberals accepted the laissez-faire economic policies advocated in Adam Smith’s <em>Wealth of Nations</em> (See <a href="27_Chapter_15The_Enlightenment.html#page_125">Chapter 15</a>).</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Liberals insisted that the laws of supply and demand would act as an “invisible hand” so that selfish individual acts would ultimately benefit the whole society by increasing productivity and thus overall prosperity.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Liberals opposed legislation designed to improve wages and hours as unnecessary interference with the competitive free market.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Liberals believed that government policies should be limited to enforcing contracts, protecting private property, and ensuring national defense.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Liberals exhibited general indifference toward the plight of the working class. They prided themselves on being tough and ruthless men who survived economic downturns, overcame destructive wars, and replaced obsolete machinery with expensive new technologies.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>SHARED BELIEFS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The existing distribution of wealth is unjust. The “haves” possess more than they need while the “have-nots” possess barely enough to survive.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_193"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>The resources and means of production should be owned by the community.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The profits of human labor should be equitably distributed.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>UTOPIAN SOCIALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Charles Fourier, Louis Blanc, and Robert Owen were the most prominent Utopian Socialists.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>They advocated social and economic planning to create societies based on cooperation rather than competition. For example, Owen built a model factory in New Lanark, Scotland. He constructed houses near the factory and rented them to his employees at reasonable rents. Owen increased wages and shortened working hours. He eliminated child labor, providing his workers’ children with free school instead. Both productivity and profits increased, supporting Owen’s contention that satisfied workers where also better workers.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Owen was less successful with a project he attempted in the United States. Founded in 1825 as a model communal village, New Harmony, Indiana, attracted an unworkable mix of hardworking idealists, contentious radicals, and selfish scoundrels. As a result, the community dissolved within four years.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels challenged the moderate approach of early socialists like Owen as the work of misguided dreamers or utopian socialists. In contrast, Marx and Engels described their ideas as scientific socialism because they were based on a scientific study of historic forces.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Friedrich Engels was the German-born manager of a cotton business in Manchester. The working conditions of factory laborers appalled Engels. In his book <em>The Condition of the Working Class in England</em>, Engels denounced the capitalist middle class for using economic liberalism as a convenient rationalization to justify their ruthless exploitation of the working class.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Engels met and befriended a fellow German, Karl Marx. Engels persuaded Marx to move to England where he subsidized Marx’s research and writing.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Marx and Engels published the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> in 1848. They boldly asserted that “the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.”</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_194"/>5<span class="C504">.</span>Historians before Marx emphasized the role of ideas in causing events. Marx took a very different approach. He argued that economic forces played the dominant role in shaping the social, political, and religious institutions.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Marx argued that human societies have always been divided into two classes—the haves and the have-nots. The haves control the means of producing goods and thus possess great wealth and power. The have-nots perform backbreaking labor but receive low wages and endure poor working conditions.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>Marx contended that the history of class conflict is best understood through the dialectical process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The thesis is the dominant state of affairs. It inevitably gives rise to a conflicting or contradictory force called the antithesis. The resulting clash between the thesis and the antithesis produces a new state of affairs called the synthesis.</p>
<p class="C515">8<span class="C504">.</span>Marx argued that nineteenth-century society had split “into two great classes directly facing each other: bourgeoisie and proletariat.” As the owners of the means of production, the bourgeoisie were the thesis. The proletariat or workers were the antithesis.</p>
<p class="C515">9<span class="C504">.</span>Marx contended that a class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat would lead “to the dictatorship of the proletariat.”</p>
<p class="C515">10<span class="C782">.</span>The “dictatorship of the proletariat” would be a transitional phase leading “to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society” in which there would be no private ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p class="C515">11<span class="C782">.</span>Marx and Engels argued that women were exploited by both men and capitalists.</p>
<p class="C515">12<span class="C782">.</span>Modern historians criticize Marx by pointing out that the European wars since the seventeenth century were not fought between the “oppressed” and their “oppressors,” but between rival religions and competing nations.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_195"/>D.</strong></span><strong>EVOLUTIONARY SOCIALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Marx predicted that as workers became more exploited they would unite to overthrow the bourgeoisie. Instead, as capitalism matured, working conditions improved.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Eduard Bernstein, “evolutionary” socialists began to revise Marxian doctrine to adjust to the new economic realities.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Bernstein rejected Marx’s concept of class struggle and instead sought to achieve socialist goals by a process of gradual reform.</p>
