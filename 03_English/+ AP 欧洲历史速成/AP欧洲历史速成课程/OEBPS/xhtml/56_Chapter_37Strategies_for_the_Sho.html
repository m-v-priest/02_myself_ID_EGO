<p class="C851"><strong>Strategies for the Short-Answer Questions</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Your APEURO exam will continue with a 40-minute section containing 3 required short-answer questions. The questions will cover topics testing your knowledge of material from the mid-1400s to the post–Cold War era in the early twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="C752">Short-answer question 1 is required and includes a secondary source stimulus. The topic of the question includes historical developments or processes between the years 1600 and 2001. Short-answer question 2 is required and includes a primary source stimulus. The topic of the question includes historical developments or processes between the years 1600 and 2001.</p>
<p class="C752">You will then be presented with two additional short-answer questions. You may select either short-answer question 3 <strong><em>or</em></strong> short-answer question 4. Neither question includes a stimulus. Short-answer question 3 focuses on historical developments or processes between the years 1450 and 1815. Short-answer question 4 focuses on historical developments or processes between the years 1815 and 2001.</p>
<p class="C752">Each short-answer question includes three specific sub-questions labeled a), b), and c). The three short-answer questions are worth 28 points, or 20 percent of your total exam score. Each of the three sub-points is worth 3.1 points.</p>

<p class="C752">Each of the three sub-parts of a short-answer question is an all-or-nothing proposition. That is, you will either receive full credit for your answer or you will receive a zero. Remember, there is no guessing penalty. Since a blank space will receive a zero, always try to write a plausible answer.</p>

<p class="C752">Most of the sub-questions can be answered in a variety of ways. Your goal is therefore not to find <strong><em>the</em></strong> answer. Instead, your goal is to find and write about <strong><em>an</em></strong> answer.</p>

<p class="C1046"><strong>SOURCE 1</strong></p>
<p class="C1030">“Betraying the hopes of the world, breaking treaties and commitments, the Soviet government after World War II embarked on a new course of forcible expansion and aggression. In 1945 and 1946 Russia’s neighbors in Europe and the Far East, their territory occupied by the Red Army at the end of the fighting, were transformed into a new kind of dependencies, so-called satellites with the Communist Party in power. Although the United States and her Western allies protested this course, Moscow remained adamant, fully aware of the inability of the Western allies to prevent this process of expansion.</p>
<p class="C1032">David J. Dallin, “Cold War and Containment,” 1956</p>
<p class="C1046"><strong>SOURCE 2</strong></p>
<p class="C1030">“Aggressive American plans to shape the postwar international economic structure along the lines of free trade and capitalist supremacy led to attempts to create a global American empire, and this in turn, caused the deterioration of relations with Communist Russia and the beginnings of the Cold War between East and West. American economic policy since 1947 has been tied primarily and increasingly to <span id="page_353"/>military aid to those governments concerned with containing, repelling, or protecting themselves from Communist aggression.”</p>

<p class="C752">Using the excerpts above, answer (a), (b), and (c).</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">a)</span>Describe one major difference between Dallin’s and Rose’s interpretation of the causes of the Cold War.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">b)</span>Explain how ONE piece of evidence in the decade after World War II supports Dallin’s interpretation.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">c)</span>Explain how ONE piece of evidence in the decade after World War II supports Rose’s interpretation.</p>
<p class="C1046"><strong>SAMPLE ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">a)</span>Dallin blamed the Cold War on Soviet expansion in Europe and the Far East. He argued that this expansion was motivated by an implacable communist ideology that viewed capitalism as an inevitable and irrevocable historic enemy. In contrast, Rose argued that America’s drive for “capitalist supremacy” turned the United States into an expansionist power that posed a threat to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">b)</span>Dallin’s argument is supported by Soviet actions in Poland. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin broke his Yalta pledges by forbidding free elections in Poland and by installing a puppet or satellite communist regime. The intrusion into Eastern and Central Europe violated the principle of national self-determination and posed a real threat to Western Europe. As the leader of the Free World, the United States had to implement a policy of containment to block Soviet expansion.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">c)</span>Rose’s argument is supported by America’s economic policy, embodied in the Marshall Plan and in its military policy embodied in the NATO alliance. Although America claimed that it funded the Marshall Plan to fight poverty, it also transformed Western Europe into a lucrative market for American products. At the same time, the NATO alliance allowed the United States to encircle the Soviet Union with military bases manned by American forces backed up by B-52 bombers and Polaris submarines armed with nuclear weapons. This policy forced the Soviet Union to develop its own nuclear weapons, thus triggering a Cold War arms race.</p>

<p class="C1030">“My earliest memories are the standard postwar memories in London. Landscapes of rubble, half a street’s disappeared. Some of it stayed like that for ten years. The main effect of the war on me was just that phrase, ‘Before the War.’ Because you’d hear grown-ups talking about it. “Oh, it wasn’t like this before the war.’ Otherwise I wasn’t particularly affected. I suppose no sugar, no sweets and candies, was a good thing, but I wasn’t happy about it. . . . The fact that I couldn’t buy a bag of sweets until 1954 says a lot about the upheavals and changes that last for so many years after the war. The war had been over for nine years before I could actually, if I had the money, go and say, ‘I’ll have a bag of them’—toffees and Aniseed Twists. Otherwise it was ‘You got your ration stamp book?’ The sound of those stamps stamping. Your ration was your ration. One little brown paper bag—a tiny one—a <em>week</em>.”</p>
<p class="C1032">Keith Richards, British rock musician, <em>Life</em>, 2010</p>
<p class="C752">Using the excerpt above, answer (a), (b), and (c).</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">a)</span>What caused the “landscapes of rubble” that formed Richards’ earliest childhood memories of London?</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">b)</span>Explain the situation that led to Richard’s needing to use ration books for almost a decade following World War II.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">c)</span>Explain one factor that continued to improve economic conditions described in the excerpt.</p>
<p class="C1046"><strong>SAMPLE ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">a)</span>The destruction in London was caused by a German bombing campaign known as the Blitz. Conducted between September 1940 and May 1941, the massive aerial bombardment claimed more than 20,000 lives in London and destroyed or damaged over a million homes. However, the Blitz failed to break British morale and actually enhanced Winston Churchill’s stature as a courageous and inspiring leader.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">b)</span>Britain emerged from World War II facing a dire economic crisis. Bankrupt and with nothing to export, Britain had no way to pay for <span id="page_355"/>imports including desperately needed food. Shortages forced the government to use ration books as an equitable way to distribute scarce goods.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">c)</span>The Marshall Plan helped stimulate Great Britain’s industrial activity and modernize its transportation and agricultural equipment. Great Britain received about one-fourth of all Marshall Plan aid, more than any other country.</p>

<p class="C1046"><strong>SAMPLE ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">a)</span>European demand for Asian spices and luxury items far exceeded the supply. Muslims and Venetians controlled trade routes to the East. The new monarchs in Spain and Portugal wanted to find sea routes to the lucrative Asian markets.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">b)</span>The discovery of the New World sparked an unprecedented global exchange of agricultural products, animals, diseases, and human populations known as the Columbian Exchange. The new crops revolutionized the European diet and helped fuel a growing population. However, European diseases decimated indigenous populations.</p>
<p class="C765">(<span class="C771">c)</span>Spain created a rigid and highly centralized New World empire controlled by the crown in Madrid. In contrast, the English established a diverse group of colonies along the North Atlantic coast. Led by the House of Burgesses in Virginia and town meetings in New England, the colonies developed a tradition of self-government.</p>

<p class="C1050">(<span class="C771">c)</span>Explain ONE way in which the New Imperialism differed from colonialism in the period from 1500 to 1700.</p>
<p class="C1046"><strong>SAMPLE ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="C1050">(<span class="C771">a)</span>Economic problems played a key role in changing European attitudes towards acquiring colonies. A deep economic depression gripped Europe between the mid-1870s and the mid-1890s, bringing unemployment and the potential for labor unrest. As the Second Industrial Revolution gathered momentum, European industrialists looked to overseas colonies as sources of raw materials and as new markets for finished goods.</p>
<p class="C1050">(<span class="C771">b)</span>The New Imperialism disrupted traditional cultures throughout Africa and Asia. The process of westernization forced colonial people to reevaluate their traditions and adopt European legal and political practices. The adoption of Western ideas caused many non-Western people to call for the modernization of their countries.</p>
<p class="C1050">(<span class="C771">c)</span>Led by Great Britain and France, the imperialist powers used steamships, railroads, underwater cables, and advanced weapons to exercise increasing economic and political control over African and Asian peoples. No longer content to simply trade with other peoples, European nations now aimed to directly rule and exploit vast regions of the globe.</p>
