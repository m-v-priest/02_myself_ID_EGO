<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE PHILOSOPHES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The philosophes were a group of thinkers and writers who espoused enlightened ideas. Taken together, they formed a grand “republic of letters.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The philosophes were not abstract philosophers. Instead, they dedicated themselves to exposing social problems and proposing reforms based upon implementing natural laws.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Although many leading philosophes were French, they were a cosmopolitan group who could be found in the American colonies and across Europe.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KEY IDEAS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Reason</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>To the philosophes, reason was the absence of intolerance, bigotry, and superstition. Reason meant informed thinking about social problems.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Humans should rely on reason, not miracles, to improve society.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Nature and natural laws</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The philosophes believed that natural laws regulate both the universe and human society.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>These natural laws can be discovered by human reason<em/>.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Happiness</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Philosophes had little interest in the medieval belief that people should accept misery in this world to find salvation in the hereafter.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_126"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>Philosophes believed that happiness in this world was an inalienable human right.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Progress</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The philosophes were the first Europeans to believe in social progress.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The discovery of laws of economics and government would improve society and make progress inevitable.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Liberty</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The philosophes lived in societies that placed restrictions on speech, religion, and trade. They wanted to remove these limitations on human liberty.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The philosophes believed that intellectual freedom was a natural right. Without freedom of expression, there could be no progress.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Toleration</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The philosophes questioned institutional religious beliefs, arguing that they perpetuated superstition, intolerance, and bigotry.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The philosophes advocated full religious tolerance.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>DEISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Deists thought of God as a cosmic watchmaker who created the universe and then let it run according to immutable natural laws.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Much of the educated elite in Western Europe and America embraced deism. However, deism’s reliance upon reason and its lack of emotion had little appeal for many people.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>A new religious movement known as pietism stressed faith, emotion, and “the religion of the heart.”</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Voltaire was the best known and most influential philosophe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>He was a prolific writer who popularized Newton’s scientific discoveries, criticized France’s rigid government, and denounced religious bigotry.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Voltaire directed his most stinging barbs at the intolerance of organized Christianity, both Protestant and Catholic.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Voltaire championed religious tolerance. He often ended his letters with the passionate demand to “<em>ecrasez l’infame”</em> (“crush the infamous thing”). This ringing exclamation reminded his readers to continue the battle against the enemies of reason—bigotry, ignorance, and religious fanaticism.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>NATURAL EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Rousseau presented his ideas on education in the novel <em>Emile</em>.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Rousseau argued that a “natural education” should replace the rigid schooling typical of his time. The key principles of a natural education included the following:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Children are naturally good and entitled to an education that emphasizes freedom and happiness.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>People develop through various stages, and individuals vary within these stages. Education must therefore be individualized since “every mind has its own form.”</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Children should be encouraged to draw their own conclusions from experience. This principle anticipated what is now called “discovery learning.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE GENERAL WILL</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span><em>The Social Contract</em>, Rousseau’s treatise on politics and government, is one of the most influential books on political theory in European history.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Thomas Hobbes and John Locke (see <a href="22_Chapter_11England__The_Emergence.html#page_89">Chapter 11</a>) argued that individuals entered a social contract with their rulers. In contrast, Rousseau argued that individuals entered into a social contract with one another. This created a community, or organized civil society.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The sovereign power in a state does not lie in a ruler. Instead, it resides in the general will of the community as a whole. The <span id="page_129"/>general will or “public spirit” is defined as any action that is right and good for all.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Rulers are servants of the community. If they fail to carry out the people’s will, they should be removed.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Rousseau’s concept of the general will and the sovereignty of the people influenced leaders of both the French and American revolutions. It is also important to note that twentieth-century dictators justified their rule by claiming to embody their nation’s general will.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ROUSSEAU AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Like other philosophes, Rousseau was committed to defending individual freedom and changing the existing social order.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>However, Rousseau distrusted reason and science. He trusted emotions and spontaneous feeling more than cold logic. As a result, Rousseau foreshadowed the romantic reaction to the Enlightenment.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>French economic reformers called physiocrats were the first to question mercantilist principles.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Led by François Quesnay, the physiocrats argued that economic activities should be freed from artificial restrictions. Governments should follow a laissez-faire policy of noninterference with the economy.</p>

<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Like Newton, Smith combined the thought of his predecessors into a single system based upon the study and application of natural laws.</p>

<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Free markets</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>In a free market, the economic laws of supply and demand will create a self-regulating economic system.</p>

<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Self-interest and the “invisible hand”</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Smith maintained that every individual is motivated by self-interest.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Competition and self-interest are socially beneficial: “Self-interest drives people to action and the Invisible Hand of competition acts as an automatic regulator so that the market will generate wealth for a nation.”</p>
