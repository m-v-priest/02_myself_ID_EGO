<p class="C851"><strong>Strategies for the Document-Based Essay Question</strong></p>
<p class="C752">After completing the short-answer questions, you will have a well-deserved 10-minute break. When you return to your desk, your exam will resume with the document-based essay question (DBQ).</p>
<p class="C752">The DBQ is an essay question requiring you to interpret and analyze 7 brief documents. The documents are typically excerpts from letters, speeches, diaries, reports, official decrees, and scholarly articles. In addition, the DBQ often includes a graph, map, political cartoon, or work of art.</p>
<p class="C752">The College Board recommends that you devote 60 minutes to the DBQ. This task typically requires about 15 minutes to read the documents, organize your thoughts, determine a thesis, and create an outline for your essay. You will then have about 45 minutes to write your DBQ essay.</p>
<p class="C752">Your DBQ can earn up to 7 rubric points. Each rubric point is worth 5 exam points. So a perfect score of 7 is worth 35 points, or 25 percent of your total exam score. It is important to remember that earning 5 of the 7 possible rubric points will keep you on pace to earn an overall score of 5 on your APEURO exam.</p>
<p class="C752">The topic of the document-based question includes historical developments or processes between the years 1600 and 2001.</p>

<p class="C752">Practice is the key to performing well on the DBQ. The following sample DBQ is designed to illustrate how to use a guided set of seven strategies that can be applied to any DBQ.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>1<span class="C447">.</span>Begin by carefully analyzing the assignment.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Begin the recommended 15-minute reading and planning period by carefully examining the assignment. Here is a sample assignment:</p>
<p class="C752">Analyze the consequences of early industrialization as seen in Manchester, England during the period 1780 to 1848.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>2<span class="C447">.</span>Carefully examine each of the seven documents.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Your next step is to read, analyze, and organize the following seven documents:</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Document 1:</strong> Source: A.P. Wadsworth and J. De Lacy, economic historians, <em>The Cotton Trade and Industrial Lancashire</em>, 1931</p>
<p class="C752">The idea of mechanical production had seized the cotton industry in Manchester. Scores of men were making machines, and equipping small factories; scores of inventive minds were at work, contributing a modification here, an adaptation there, which passed into common stock. There is no machine without its history of trial and error, and the men whose names have become household words were surrounded by a whole society of inventors to whom the progress of cotton machinery owes hardly less than it does to them.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong><span id="page_360"/>Document 2:</strong> Source: William Cobbett, well-known journalist and reform politician, <em>Political Register</em>, 1824</p>
<p class="C752">Some of these lords of the loom have in their employ thousands of miserable creatures. In the cotton-spinning work, fourteen hours in each day, locked up, summer and winter, in a heat of from eighty to eighty-four degrees. . . . Not only is there not a breath of sweet air in these truly infernal scenes, but, for a large part of the time, there is the abominable and pernicious stink of the gas to assist in the murderous effects of the heat. In addition to the noxious effluvia of the gas, mixed with the steam, there are the dust, and what is called cotton-flyings or fuzz, which the unfortunate creatures have to inhale. . . . Can any man, with a heart in his body, and a tongue in his head, refrain from cursing a system that produces such slavery and such cruelty?</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Document 3:</strong> Source: Alexis de Tocqueville, French political philosopher and historian, <em>Journeys to England and Ireland</em>, 1835</p>
<p class="C752">A thick black smoke covers the city. The sun appears like a disc without any rays. In this semi-daylight 300,000 people work ceaselessly. A thousand noises rise amidst this unending damp and dark labyrinth . . . the footsteps of a busy crowd, the crunching wheels of machines, the shriek of steam from the boilers, the regular beat of looms, the heavy rumble of carts, these are the only noises from which you can never escape in these dark half-lit streets. . . . From this foul drain the greatest stream of human industry flows out to fertilize the whole world. From this filthy sewer pure gold flows. Here humanity attains its most complete development and its most brutish; here civilization works its miracles, and civilized man is turned back into a savage.</p>

<p class="C752"><strong><span id="page_361"/>Document 5:</strong> Source: James Leach, former factory worker and reformer, <em>Stubborn Facts from the Factories by a Manchester Operative</em>, 1844</p>
<p class="C752">In some factories none but women are allowed to labour, excepting a few men, such as managers . . . not because the women can perform the work better or turn off a greater quantity, but because they are considered to be more docile than men under the injustice that in some shape or form is daily practiced upon them. A great number of the females employed in factories are married, and not a small number of them are mothers. . . . We have repeatedly seen married females, in the last stages of pregnancy, slaving from morning till night beside these never-tiring machines, and when oppressed nature became so exhausted that they were obliged to sit down to take a moment’s ease, and being seen by the manager, were fined for the offense.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Document 6:</strong> Source: Hugh Miller, Scottish geologist and writer, <em>First Impressions of England and Its People</em>, 1846</p>
<p class="C752">The hapless river—a pretty enough stream a few miles higher up, with trees overhanging its banks and fringes of green sedge set thick along its edges—loses caste as it gets among the mills and printworks. There are myriads of dirty things given it to wash, and whole wagon-loads of poisons from dye-houses and bleach-yards thrown into it to carry away, steam-boilers discharge into it their seething contents, and drains and sewers their fetid impurities; till at length it rolls on—here between tall dingy walls, there under precipices of red sandstone—considerably less a river than a flood of liquid manure, in which all life dies, whether animal or vegetable, and which resembles nothing in nature, except, perhaps, the stream thrown out in eruption by some mud-volcano.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Document 7:</strong> Source: Friedrich Engels, early socialist writer, <em>Condition of the Working Class in England</em>, 1845</p>
<p class="C752">One day I walked with one of those middle-class gentlemen into Manchester. I spoke to him about the disgraceful slums and drew his attention to the disgusting condition of that part of the town in which the factory workers lived. I declared that I had never seen so badly built a town in my life. He listened patiently and at the corner of the street at which we parted company, he remarked, “And yet there is a great deal of money made here. Good morning, Sir!”</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>3<span class="C447">.</span>Create an organizational chart.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Many students find it very helpful to organize the documents by placing them into a chart. For this assignment, your chart should focus on ecological/health, social, and economic consequences. Here is an example of what your chart could look like:</p>

<p class="C796"><strong>4<span class="C447">.</span>Write an opening paragraph that establishes the historic CONTEXT of the event.</strong></p>
<p class="C752">Your opening paragraph is an excellent place to establish the historic context for the event specified in your DBQ assignment. Remember that the contextualization point will contribute 5 points to your total exam score.</p>
<p class="C752">Your opening paragraph is very important. Use the first 2–3 sentences to establish the historic context for the topic specified in your prompt. The first two sentences in our sample introductory paragraph provide the “big picture” for the historic setting of the emergence of Manchester as an industrial center. Then use your next 2–3 sentences to present a clearly defined thesis that establishes your line of reasoning. Sentences 3–5 in our sample opening paragraph clearly establish a line of reasoning that by identifying the adverse consequences for public health, the environment, and society along with the economic benefits of early industrialization in Manchester.</p>
<p class="C752">Our “combo” paragraph combines contextualization and the thesis. This combination is worth 2 rubric points or 10 exam points! Given this high value plan carefully. There is no rule stating that you must begin writing after 15 minutes. It is better to take a few extra minutes to carefully construct your opening paragraph than to rush and end up with a weak thesis. <span id="page_363"/>It is important to note that you should not divide this paragraph. Readers expect to see your thesis in the first paragraph. DBQ readers report that the overwhelming majority of students begin their essays with a combo approach.</p>
<p class="C752">Here is a sample introductory paragraph that establishes the context for the emergence of Manchester as the world’s first industrial city:</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Essay introduction</strong></p>
<p class="C1036"><em>The political history of the years from the French Revolution to the revolutions of 1848 was dominated by the rise of liberalism and nationalism and the unsuccessful attempts to suppress them. The economic history of this period was shaped by the first phase of the Industrial Revolution that began in Manchester, England and then spread from Great Britain to continental Europe. Contemporary observers recognized that Manchester was the birthplace of profound ecological, social, and economic changes that were fundamentally transforming their world. These commentators offered scathing criticism of how industrial factories polluted Manchester’s environment and divided its society into a small number of wealthy entrepreneurs and a large mass of impoverished workers. Despite these drawbacks, Manchester nurtured and rewarded a revolutionary and lasting spirit of free enterprise that energized the Industrial Revolution</em>.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>5<span class="C447">.</span>Support your argument with evidence from the documents (2 points)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The DBQ rubric awards you 1 point for using the content of at least three documents to address the prompt. However, you can earn 2 points by using 6 of the 7 documents to support your argument.</p>
<p class="C752">Most students are tempted to “plow through” the documents by addressing them one at a time. Although this strategy will earn 1 point, it will probably not earn 2 points. The most effective way to earn 2 points is to group the documents into the categories you created in your chart. Our sample essay groups the documents into 4 body paragraphs. This grouping allows for relevant and insightful connections. For example, note how the final sentence of body paragraph 2 makes a relevant and insightful connection between documents 6, 2, and 3. Similarly, the opening sentence of body paragraph 3 makes a meaningful connection between documents 5 and 7.</p>
<p class="C752">It is important to note that you do not have to use all seven documents. You can and should omit a document that you either don’t understand or that doesn’t fit into your organization.</p>
<p class="C752"><strong>Essay body paragraphs</strong></p>
<p class="C838"><em>(1<span class="C520z">)</span>Documents 2 and 4 offer compelling commentaries and alarming statistics documenting the appalling public health conditions in Manchester. William Cobbett hoped his articles in the</em> Political Register <em>would mobilize public support to arouse Parliament to address working conditions in Manchester. <span id="page_364"/>Cobbett assailed the “lords of the loom” and decried the “murderous effects of the heat” on workers forced to inhale cotton dust. (Document 2) Taken from a prestigious British medical journal, Document 4 provides mortality statistics corroborating Cobbett’s concerns. For example, the average age of death of Laborers/Artisans in Manchester was 17 compared to 38 in Rutland, a nearby rural district</em>.</p>
<p class="C838"><em>(2<span class="C520z">)</span>The “infernal scenes” described by Cobbett (Document 2) were not limited to working conditions inside Manchester’s textile mills. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that “300,000 people work ceaselessly” in a city covered by “a thick black smoke” that obscures the sun and forces people to live in “dark half-lit streets.” (Document 3) Hugh Miller, a self-taught Scottish geologist, offered his concerned readers a vivid description of how industry was despoiling Manchester’s natural environment. Document 6 contains Miller’s memorable warning of how chemicals, dyes, and other waste products transformed the river Irwell into “a flood of liquid manure, in which all life dies.” Miller’s description corroborates Cobbett’s and de Tocqueville’s accounts of an ecological disaster that threatened to spread from Manchester to Britain’s other industrial centers</em>.</p>
<p class="C838"><em>(3<span class="C520z">)</span>The systematic exploitation of Manchester’s factory workers outraged both James Leach (Document 5) and Friedrich Engels (Document 7). Leach focused on the deplorable working conditions endured by women laboring in Manchester’s textile mills. He wrote his report to persuade Parliament to address the plight of mothers and pregnant women “slaving from morning till night beside the never-tiring machines.” (Document 5) Engels did more than call for reforms. His account of Manchester’s “disgraceful slums” prompted the German socialist Karl Marx to visit the city. Their experiences in Manchester fueled the overwhelming sense of indignation and urgency in</em> The Communist Manifesto<em>. Published in 1848, the polemic called upon workers to unite and forcibly create a new classless society</em>.</p>
<p class="C838"><em>(4<span class="C520z">)</span>Although Manchester’s deplorable living and working conditions aroused a storm of criticism, the city also had resolute defenders. The middle-class gentleman in Document 7 listened patiently to Engels’ criticisms and then calmly noted, “And yet there is a great deal of money made here.” Alexis de Tocqueville succinctly summarized Manchester’s core paradox by observing, “From this filthy sewer pure gold flows.” (Document 3) De Tocqueville was right. Manchester’s textile mills produced material goods on a scale unknown in history. These products generated a river of golden profits that enabled Great Britain to become the world’s undisputed industrial leader. In Document 1, two laissez-faire British economic historians praise Manchester’s “society of inventors” whose entrepreneurial spirit built the world’s first industrial city. The new class of successful entrepreneurs replaced the landed aristocracy as the dominant force in the process of modernizing domestic life in the nineteenth century</em>.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong><span id="page_365"/>6<span class="C447">.</span>Provide evidence beyond the documents (1 point)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The DBQ rubric awards you 1 point for including at least one additional piece of evidence beyond that found in the seven documents. The evidence must be presented in more than a brief phrase or a passing mention and it must be relevant to an argument about the prompt.</p>
<p class="C752">One effective strategy for earning the beyond the evidence point is to view each document as a springboard for additional information. For example, Document 7 provides a famous anecdote written by Friedrich Engels. Note that the passage does not mention Karl Marx. This omission invites you to add information about the importance of the future relationship between Engels and Karl Marx. The last four sentences of body paragraph 3 provide relevant evidence that goes beyond Document 7.</p>
<p class="C1036"><em>Engels did more than call for reforms. His account of Manchester’s “disgraceful slums” prompted the German socialist Karl Marx to visit the city. Their experiences in Manchester fueled the overwhelming sense of indignation and urgency in</em> The Communist Manifesto<em>. Published in 1848, the polemic called upon workers to unite and forcibly create a new classless society</em>.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>7<span class="C447">.</span>Sourcing documents with HIPP analysis (1 point)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The DBQ rubric awards 1 point for sourcing at least 3 documents. Sourcing means that you must explain how or why a document’s historical situation, intended audience, purpose, OR point of view is relevant to an argument about the prompt. It is very important to note the word OR in this definition.</p>
<p class="C752">Many students use the acronym <strong>HIPP</strong> to help them remember the four types of ways to source a document. The <strong>H</strong> stands for historical setting and includes what happened at that time. The <strong>I</strong> stands for intended audience and includes who the document was created for. The first <strong>P</strong> stands for purpose and includes the author’s intent. The second <strong>P</strong> stands for point of view and includes the author’s perspective.</p>
<p class="C752">Our sample essay sources documents 2 (purpose), 6 (audience), 5 (purpose) and 1 (point of view). Although you only have to source 3 documents, many AP® readers recommend that you source 4 documents. This provides you with a safety in case you fail to properly source a document. Your incorrect safety will not be counted against you.</p>
<p class="C1036"><em>William Cobbett hoped his articles in the</em> Political Register <em>would mobilize public support to arouse Parliament to address working conditions in Manchester. Cobbett assailed the “lords of the loom” and decried the “murderous effects of the heat” on workers forced to inhale cotton dust. (Document 2) (Purpose)</em></p>
<p class="C1036"><em>Hugh Miller, a self-taught Scottish geologist offered his concerned readers a vivid description of how industry was despoiling Manchester’s natural environment</em>.</p>
<p class="C752"><em><span id="page_366"/>Document 6 contains Miller’s memorable warning of how chemicals, dyes, and other waste products transformed the river Irwell into “a flood of liquid manure, in which all life dies.” (Audience)</em></p>
<p class="C1036"><em>In Document 5, Leach focused on the deplorable working conditions endured by women laboring in Manchester’s textile mills. He wrote his report to persuade Parliament to address the plight mothers and pregnant women “slaving from morning till night beside the never-tiring machines.” (Purpose)</em></p>
<p class="C1036"><em>In Document 1, two laissez-faire British economic historians praise Manchester’s “society of inventors” whose entrepreneurial spirit built the world’s first industrial city. (Point of View)</em></p>
<p class="C796"><strong>8<span class="C447">.</span>Adding a conclusion (Maybe 1 point)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The DBQ rubric does not require a conclusion. However, many experienced readers recommend that you write a conclusion. Here’s why: Students often have a difficult time writing a concise thesis statement in their opening paragraph. Fortunately, the rubric awards a thesis point if your thesis is in either the introduction or the conclusion. The process of writing your DBQ essay will crystallize your thoughts enabling you to write a cogent thesis in your conclusion. Here is an example from our model essay:</p>
<p class="C1036"><em>Manchester did produce deleterious ecological and social consequences. The industrial revolution ravaged Manchester’s natural environment. It also created a callous society that exploited the city’s working class. However, Manchester was also the birthplace of a revolutionary spirit of free enterprise that raised living standards and formed the foundation for a second Industrial Revolution that swept across England and America during the second half of the nineteenth century</em>.</p>
<p class="C796"><strong>9<span class="C447">.</span>A complex understanding (1 point)</strong></p>
<p class="C752">The complexity point is difficult to earn. Readers award this elusive point to less than 5 percent of all DBQ essays. Difficult does not mean impossible. Our model essay opens with a sophisticated thesis stating that Manchester’s industrial experience had both adverse and beneficial consequences. It then continues this line of reasoning by grouping the documents into paragraphs discussing the public health, environmental, social, and economic consequences of early industrialization in Manchester. These categories enable the essay to provide multiple perspectives. The concluding paragraph unifies the essay’s line of reasoning. Taken together, these components provide a nuanced argument that would earn the complexity point.</p>
