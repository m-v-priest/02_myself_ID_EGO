<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE OLD IMPERIALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>European powers practiced an early form of imperialism between 1500 and 1800. During this period, Portugal, the Dutch Republic, and England built trading-post empires along the coasts of Africa, India, and Indonesia. For example, Portuguese traders established a mutually lucrative trade with the West African kingdom of Benin. The Portuguese prized Benin’s rich supply of pepper, ivory, and gold. In return, the rulers of Benin prized Portugal’s rich supply of coral beads, brass bracelets, and horses.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The New World was a notable exception to the pattern of coastal trading posts. Spain established an enormous empire that included the West Indies, Central America, and South America. Beginning in 1607, the English began to colonize the east coast of North America.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Old Imperialists created the world’s first global maritime trading network. Centered in the Atlantic Ocean, the network featured the exchange of enslaved Africans, Caribbean sugar, and Chesapeake tobacco.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW IMPERIALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1500, the European powers controlled about 7 percent of the globe’s land. By 1800, they controlled 35 percent. A new Age of Imperialism began in 1870 as European powers, plus the United States and Japan, rapidly acquired vast overseas empires. By 1914, the new imperialist powers controlled 84 percent of the globe’s land.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Great Britain and France, the imperialist powers exercised increasing economic and political control over Africa and Asia. No longer content to simply trade with other peoples, European <span id="page_236"/>nations now aimed to directly rule and exploit extensive regions of the globe. For example, a British force of 1,200 well-armed soldiers toppled the ruler of Benin, burned his palace, and seized 2,500 works of bronze and ivory art.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The imperialist powers seized direct control over some areas such as German East Africa and French Indochina. In other areas, they established protectorates where the dependent country had its own government but was still subject to the authority of the imperial power. And finally, the great powers established spheres of influence over large parts of China.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>EFFICIENT NEW FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Second Industrial Revolution (see <a href="36_Chapter_22The_Second_Wave_of_Ind.html#page_189">Chapter 22</a>) created the tools of transportation, communication, and warfare that facilitated the rapid pace of global empire building.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Iron steamships fueled by coal replaced smaller wind-powered wooden sailing vessels. The new steamships could carry large cargoes of people and goods. As a result, Europeans used sea lanes to connect their colonies with the home country.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Insulated underwater cables revolutionized communication. In 1850, steam-powered mailboats required two to three months for a round-trip voyage from London to Bombay, India. Just 20 years later, companies in London and Bombay could exchange telegrams within hours.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>POWERFUL NEW WEAPONS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The imperialist powers equipped their armies with an arsenal of advanced weapons that included repeating rifles and Maxim machine guns.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_237"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>A Maxim machine gun could fire 11 bullets in just one second. In 1898, a small but well-armed British force needed only 5 hours to slaughter 11,000 Sudanese soldiers in a battle fought near Omdurman. Winston Churchill later described the appalling “suffering, despairing, and dying” created by “a hell of whistling metal, exploding shells, and sputtering dust.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>EFFECTIVE NEW MEDICINES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitos. Its life-threatening fever posed a formidable obstacle to European travelers attempting to explore mosquito infested jungles and swamps in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Quinine was first isolated in 1820 from the bark of the cinchona tree. Large-scale use of quinine as an effective treatment for malaria began after 1850. It soon played a significant role in enabling Europeans to colonize western and central Africa.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMIC GAINS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>European interest in overseas colonies began to weaken in the half century following the Congress of Vienna. In 1852, the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli referred to India and other colonies as “a millstone round our necks.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Economic problems played a key role in changing European attitudes towards acquiring colonies. A deep economic depression gripped Europe between the mid-1870s and the mid-1890s, bringing rising unemployment and the potential for labor unrest.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>As the Second Industrial Revolution gathered momentum, European industrialists looked to overseas colonies as sources of essential raw materials and as new markets for finished goods.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Economic rivalry quickly fueled a rush for colonies in Africa and Asia. By 1900, ivory and rubber from the Congo, diamonds and gold from South Africa, and rubber and rice from French Indochina provided lucrative raw materials for European economic growth.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_238"/>B.</strong></span><strong>GEOPOLITICAL ADVANTAGES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The great powers understood the importance of a strong navy to protect vital sea routes connecting a home country with its overseas colonies.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The great steamships required bases where they could take on coal and other needed supplies. For example, Singapore served as a strategic base for British ships. The British imperialist Lord Curzon understood the geopolitical importance of Singapore and other strategic bases when he described them as “pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out in a game for the domination of the world.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>NATIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Colonial expansion offered all citizens a vicarious share in national glory. Mass-circulation newspapers thrilled their readers with stories describing how intrepid explorers and dedicated missionaries overcame hardship and danger.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>“Colonial fever” became a source of national pride. Imperialists proudly displayed world maps with their nation’s empire highlighted in bright colors. Colored in red, a map of the British empire provided schoolchildren with patriotic visual evidence that “the sun never sets on the British empire.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>RACIAL SUPERIORITY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Imperialism contradicted the European belief in local self-rule. However, imperialists ignored this inconsistency by using Social Darwinism (see <a href="40_Chapter_25Society__Mass_Politics.html#page_221">Chapter 25</a>) to justify their actions.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Social Darwinists assumed that some races are fitter than others. Europeans pointed to steamships, railroads, and machines guns as evidences of their superiority. They saw no reason to respect the cultures of “backward” peoples.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>A CIVILIZING MISSION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>It was a short mental step from a belief in racial superiority to a belief that Europeans were engaged in a “civilizing mission” to bring medicines, laws, Christianity, and other blessings of Western civilization to the people in their colonies.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The popular British writer Rudyard Kipling appealed not only to his readers’ spirit of adventure, but also to their feelings of superiority. He saw imperialism as a beneficial mission to “civilize non-<span id="page_239"/>Europeans” and urged his readers to “Take up the White Man’s Burden” by modernizing “primitive” native cultures.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE “DARK CONTINENT”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Inspired by Prince Henry the Navigator, fifteenth-century Portuguese sea captains began to explore the west coast of Africa. The Portuguese and other European countries established trading posts along the coast. However, they learned very little about the interior of what they called the “Dark Continent.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>By the mid-1800s, Africa contained more than 700 different ethnic groups, each with its own language and customs. The people in this vast region could neither foresee nor prevent the irrevocable changes that the Second Industrial Revolution and imperialist rivalries would inflict on their lives.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KING LEOPOLD II AND THE CONGO</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>King Leopold II of Belgium began the process of exploiting the African interior. Reports of central Africa’s “unspeakable riches” fired Leopold’s imagination. Motivated by insatiable greed, Leopold was determined to devour “the magnificent cake of Africa.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Leopold formed the International Congo Association in 1875 as a private enterprise. The Congo’s rubber trees provided one of the world’s few sources of this increasingly valuable raw material. Leopold coerced the native population into harvesting the trees while working under brutal conditions.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE BERLIN CONFERENCE, 1884–1885</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Leopold’s actions ignited European interest in Africa. Soon Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal also claimed parts of the continent.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Alarmed by the rising tensions, the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck convened a conference in Berlin to establish rules for dividing Africa. Representatives from all the major European nations and the United States attended the conference. However, the European leaders did not invite a single African ruler to attend the conference.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_240"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>The Berlin Conference opened on November 15, 1884, and concluded on February 26, 1885. The conference did not actually partition Africa. However, it did establish guidelines for regulating colonial activity in Africa. For example, the conference adopted a requirement that a country’s territorial claims must be based on “effective occupation” defined as a strong actual presence in the area being claimed.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE “SCRAMBLE FOR AFRICA”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>When the new imperialism began in 1875, Europe controlled less than 10 percent of Africa. The Berlin Conference prompted a feverish “scramble for Africa.” By 1900, the European powers established colonies in 90 percent of the continent. Only Ethiopia (which successfully resisted an Italian invasion) and Liberia (which had been settled by freed slaves from the United States) remained independent.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Great Britain controlled the lion’s share of Africa. The British empire stretched from Egypt in the north to the Cape of Good Hope in the south.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The French empire included Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia along with a vast expanse of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Portuguese annexed huge domains in Angola and Mozambique.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The Germans established colonies in German East Africa and in the Cameroons and Tongo on the west coast.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>European diplomats created large unwieldy states that ignored traditional cultures and often forced rival tribes to occupy the same land.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>INDIA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>British economic interest in India began in the 1600s when the British East India Company established treaty ports at Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta. The company quickly took advantage of the growing weakness of India’s ruling Mughal dynasty. By 1757, the British East India Company ruled large parts of India with little interference from the British government.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_241"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>The British East India Company maintained an army led by British officers and staffed by sepoys or Indian soldiers. Like many Indians, the sepoys resented Britain’s arrogant disregard for their cultural traditions. In 1857, word spread among the sepoys that their British-made rifle cartridges were sealed with beef and pork fat. Soldiers had to bite off the seal to use the cartridges. This outraged Hindus who were not allowed to touch beef and Muslims who were prohibited from eating pork.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>On May 10, 1857, sepoy units rebelled against the British. Stunned British forces finally restored order after both sides suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Sepoy Mutiny marked a turning point in Britain’s relationship with India. In 1858, administration of India passed from the East India Company to the British crown. The British adopted a more tolerant approach towards Indian religious traditions. At the same time, the British launched a massive development program that included beginning irrigation projects, constructing schools, and building an extensive network of railroad lines.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>India soon emerged as the cornerstone of the British empire. The Industrial Revolution had turned Britain into the world’s workshop and India became a major supplier of raw materials for that workshop. India’s railroads enabled farmers to ship cotton, rice, jute, and tea to coastal ports where steamships transported these products to Great Britain. In return, India absorbed one-fifth of Britain’s total exports. This lucrative economic relationship prompted Prime Minister Disraeli to describe India as “the brightest jewel in Her Majesty’s Crown.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>INDOCHINA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Vietnam forms a long curving S on the eastern shore of the Indochina peninsula. French soldiers gradually conquered Vietnam in the years between 1857 and 1883. Ten years later, France completed the conquest by adding Cambodia (now Kampuchea) and Laos to its Indochina empire.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>French colonists quickly exploited the region’s economic resources. Huge plantations used cheap peasant labor to produce valuable crops of rice and rubber. By the early 1900s, Indochina produced all of France’s raw rubber and much of its imported rice.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>French colonists used their wealth to support a luxurious standard of living. Saigon’s tree-lined streets and fashionable shops earned it the title “Paris of the Orient.” French officials proudly called Vietnam “our marvelous balcony on the Pacific.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_242"/>C.</strong></span><strong>CHINA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The modern phase of European relations with China began in the early 1800s. At that time, the British traded wool and Indian cotton for Chinese tea. However, a trade imbalance occurred when Britain’s thirst for Chinese tea far exceeded Chinese demand for English textiles.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Unscrupulous British merchants discovered that opium, a habit-forming narcotic, could be used to balance the trade deficit. British opium exports to China soared from 200 chests in 1729 to 40,000 chests in 1838. Britain prospered as Chinese addicts began to pay for the drug with silver.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The weak Chinese government desperately tried to halt the opium trade. In 1839, the controversy escalated into an armed conflict known as the Opium War. Outdated Chinese ships proved to be no match for modern British gunboats. In 1842, the two sides signed the Treaty of Nanking. The treaty awarded the British the strategic island of Hong Kong and the right to trade at Canton and four other ports.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Treaty of Nanking marked the beginning of a century of Chinese humiliation. Between 1870 and 1914, Western nations carved China into spheres of influence. Britain, France, Germany, and Japan controlled trade, tariffs, harbor duties, and railroad rights in their respective spheres.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Although the United States did not take part in carving up China, American officials became increasingly alarmed that the European powers and Japan would restrict American trading opportunities in their spheres of influence. On September 6, 1899, Secretary of State John Hay dispatched a series of diplomatic notes asking the governments of these nations to respect the rights of other nations within their spheres of influence. The European powers and Japan neither accepted nor rejected Hay’s Open Door notes. Hay nonetheless announced that all the powers had agreed and that their consent was therefore “final and definitive.”</p>

<p class="C515"><span id="page_243"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Foreign trade increased from just 3 percent of the world’s output in 1800 to 33 percent by 1913.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Imperialism disrupted traditional cultures throughout Africa and Asia. For example, Kenyan farmers put aside traditional agricultural crops in order to grow coffee, tea, and sugar for European markets.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The process of westernization forced colonial peoples to reevaluate their traditions and adopt European legal and political practices.
