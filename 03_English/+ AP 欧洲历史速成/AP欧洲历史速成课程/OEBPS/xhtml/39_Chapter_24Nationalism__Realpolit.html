<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Nationalism held that all people derive their identities from their nations. A nation is a group of people who share a common culture, sense of identity, and aspiration to achieve political independence.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SECOND EMPIRE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1848, French voters elected Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (nephew of Napoleon I) the new president of the Second French Republic.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Just four years later, Louis Napoleon proclaimed France an empire and declared himself Emperor Napoleon III. A vast majority of the French people endorsed these proclamations.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMIC PROGRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon III understood the importance of modern industrialization. His economic policies included the following achievements:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Railroad mileage increased by more than fivefold.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Moderate free-trade policies doubled exports.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Industrial production doubled, enriching the middle class.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon did not ignore the working class. He legalized trade unions and improved public housing.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>REBUILDING PARIS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon named Baron Georges Haussmann to oversee a vast project to redesign Paris.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Haussmann replaced narrow streets and congested working-class neighborhoods with wide avenues, impressive public monuments, and expansive parks.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The rebuilding project accomplished several objectives:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>It transformed Paris into a symbol of France’s prosperity and greatness.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>It made it much harder for rioters to blockade streets.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>QUEST FOR GLORY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon believed that the Concert of Europe (see <a href="37_Chapter_23Restoration_and_Revolu.html#page_197">Chapter 23</a>) limited France’s foreign policy.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE CAUSES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>A squabble over jurisdiction within the holy places in Turkish-ruled Jerusalem brought France (the protector of the Catholics) and Russia (the protector of the Orthodox clergy) into diplomatic controversy, with Turkey in the middle.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Tsar Nicholas I saw an opportunity to dominate Turkey and secure entrance into the Mediterranean through the Turkish Straits.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Austria felt threatened by Russia’s expansion into the Balkans.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>France and Britain opposed any change in the regional balance of power.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The war was named after the Crimean peninsula, part of the Russian Empire that juts out into the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The major action of the Crimean War was a year-long siege of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Crimean War lined up most of the European powers against Russia. France, Britain, Turkey, and a contingent of 18,000 men from Piedmont-Sardinia captured the strongly defended Russian fortress at Sevastopol.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Austria did not participate in the actual fighting. Russia resented Austria’s “ingratitude” for the aid Nicholas I had given the Austrians during the Hungarian uprising in 1849.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The new Russian tsar, Alexander II, sued for peace after the fall of Sevastopol in 1855.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>The war claimed over 500,000 lives, most caused by disease and inadequate medical care.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Crimean War marked the first great power conflict since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 (see <a href="33_Chapter_20Restoration_and_Romant.html#page_171">Chapter 20</a>).</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Crimean War left a legacy of unresolved international tensions.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon III achieved his objective of breaking the alliance between Russia and Austria. The coalition between these two <span id="page_210"/>conservative powers had blocked France’s ambitions for greater influence since 1815.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon III emerged as a leading figure in European affairs. This new prestige encouraged him to play a greater role in Italy.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>By entering the war on the side of France and Britain, Piedmont-Sardinia hoped to gain allies in its drive for Italian unification.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Russia’s humiliating defeat forced Alexander II to launch an ambitious program of reforms.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>The Crimean War left Austria isolated from its two traditional allies, Russia and Prussia. This exposed a now vulnerable Austria to Italian and German nationalism.</p>
<p class="C515">8<span class="C504">.</span>The English nurse Florence Nightingale organized a battlefield nursing service to care for the British sick and wounded. She played an important role in professionalizing nursing for women.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Tsar Alexander II was an autocrat whose will was law.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Russia’s aristocracy continued to own almost all the land and be exempt from taxes.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Russia had a very small middle class. Ninety-five percent of the people were peasants, most of whom were serfs.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ALEXANDER’S REFORMS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The emancipation of the serfs, 1861</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>In 1861, Alexander II issued an Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Although they were free, the peasants still did not own the land.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The creation of zemstvos</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>In 1864, Alexander introduced a system of local and regional self-government through elected assemblies called zemstvos.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_211"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>Although the zemstvos did provide some opportunity for public discussion, they did not lead to the creation of a national assembly.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ALEXANDER’S DEATH</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Alexander II’s reforms only partially succeeded in developing the administrative, economic, and civic institutions that strengthened nation-states elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The more changes Alexander II introduced, the more hopes he aroused. When it became apparent that the tsar continued to maintain a tight grip on power, disillusioned intellectuals began to refer to themselves as “nihilists” or believers in nothing.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>At first nihilists expounded radical ideas and disregarded conventional manners. For example, rebellious daughters of the nobility cut their hair short and used phony marriages to escape parental control.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>During the late 1870s, some nihilists formed a secret society, “The People’s Will,” whose aim was to overthrow the government.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Faced with mounting dissent, Alexander II wavered between renewed reaction and new reform policies.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>On March 13, 1881, a member of the People’s Will hurled a bomb at Alexander’s carriage as he rode through Saint Petersburg. The gravely wounded tsar died later that day.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>Alexander II’s death triggered a major suppression of civil liberties, thus ending hopes for peaceful reforms in Russia.</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In 1852, Piedmont’s King Victor Emmanuel II named Count Camillo di Cavour his prime minister.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Realpolitik</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Early Italian nationalists such as Mazzini had been inspired by romantic ideals of nationalism.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Cavour was a realist guided by the dictates of political power. He believed that shrewd diplomacy and well-chosen alliances were more useful than grand proclamations and romantic rebellions.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Cavour’s successful combination of power politics and secret diplomacy is called Realpolitik, “the politics of reality.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Strengthening Piedmont</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Cavour launched an ambitious economic program that included building railroads and expanding commerce.</p>

<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Franco-Piedmont alliance</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Cavour understood that Austria was the greatest obstacle to Italian unity.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Cavour formed an alliance with Napoleon III to drive Austria out of northern Italy.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_213"/>C.</strong></span><strong>WAR WITH AUSTRIA, 1859</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The combined French and Piedmont armies defeated the Austrians. Meanwhile, Italian nationalists staged revolts across northern Italy.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Sardinia annexed all of northern Italy except Venetia.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>GIUSEPPE GARIBALDI AND THE RED SHIRTS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The pragmatic Cavour and the romantic Garibaldi agreed that Italy should be freed from foreign control.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>While Cavour was uniting the north, he also secretly supported Garibaldi in the south.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In May 1860, Garibaldi and his small but zealous force of so-called Red Shirts successfully invaded and liberated the kingdom of the Two Sicilies.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Garibaldi agreed to step aside and let Victor Emmanuel rule the areas he had conquered.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>PERSISTENT PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In March 1861, an Italian parliament formally proclaimed the Kingdom of Italy with Victor Emmanuel II as king “by the grace of God and the will of the nation.” Tragically, Cavour died just two months later.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The newly unified Kingdom of Italy faced a number of persistent problems:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Unification was still not complete. Venetia remained under Austrian control and the papacy led by Pius IX remained hostile to the new Italian state.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Northern Italy was urban, sophisticated, and increasingly industrialized. Southern Italy remained rural, backward, and poor.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The causes</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>France feared the sudden emergence of a strong and aggressive Prussia. It is important to note that France had opposed German unity for centuries.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Bismarck adroitly exploited a minor dispute between France and Prussia over the search for a new Spanish monarch. By skillfully editing the Ems Dispatch, Bismarck inflamed relations between France and Prussia.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Napoleon III declared war on Prussia on July 19, 1870.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The war</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Prussians successfully invaded France and forced Napoleon III to surrender on September 2, 1870.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_216"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>On January 18, 1871, King William I was proclaimed German emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The consequences</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Bismarck imposed a harsh settlement. He forced France to pay a huge indemnity and cede Alsace and most of Lorraine to the German empire.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The loss of rich deposits of coal and iron ore was a severe blow to France’s economy. The loss of these provinces was an even greater blow to French national pride.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The unification of Germany created a new European balance of power. As the German empire rapidly industrialized, it became the strongest state on the continent of Europe and a formidable rival to Great Britain. As a new great power, Germany played a key role in every major international crisis from 1871 to 1945.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: CAVOUR AND BISMARCK</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Similarities</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Both Cavour and Bismarck were shrewd masters of Realpolitik. For example, Cavour participated in the Crimean War in order to gain allied support for Piedmont-Sardinia’s leadership in the drive for Italian unification. Bismarck used the Ems Dispatch to help provoke a war with France.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Both Cavour and Bismarck were skillful opportunists who took advantage of unfolding events. Cavour began by hoping to enlarge Piedmont-Sardinia, but ended by creating the Kingdom of Italy. Bismarck began by working for a stronger Prussia, but ended by creating a German Reich.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Differences</p>
