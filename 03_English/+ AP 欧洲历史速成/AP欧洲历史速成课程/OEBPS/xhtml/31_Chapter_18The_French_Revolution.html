<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>PEASANT DISTRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Peasants comprised over four-fifths of France’s 26 million people.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Peasants lost half their income to taxes. They paid feudal dues to nobles, tithes to the church, and royal taxes to the king’s agents. In addition, they paid a land tax called the taille and performed forced labor called the corvée. Although they paid most of the taxes, the peasants received few services in return.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Overburdened peasants lived at the edge of destitution. Grain shortages led to sharp increases in the price of bread. The rising cost of bread was a major cause of discontent.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ARISTOCRATIC PRIVILEGE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>French nobles enjoyed a position of unrivaled privilege. For example, nobles were except from paying taxes. Every bishop in France was of noble birth and only nobles could receive commissions in the army.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The nobles refused to consider making sacrifices of any kind. They were determined to maintain and even increase their political power and economic privileges.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ROYAL INEPTITUDE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XV (reigned 1715–1774) was a weak and indecisive ruler.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Louis XVI (reigned 1774–1792) became king when he was just 20 years old. He was a good man but a very poor king. Louis XVI was an excellent locksmith and preferred hunting to ruling. His Austrian-born wife Marie Antoinette correctly described him as a timid person who was “afraid to command.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_152"/>D.</strong></span><strong>BOURGEOISE DISCONTENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>France’s foreign trade increased by 500 percent between 1713 and 1789.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The steady growth in commerce brought bourgeoise merchants rising profits. However, their growing wealth did not translate into either political power or social status. Discontented bourgeoise began to view the privileged nobles as “parasites” who contributed little to the French economy while erecting barriers to social mobility.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Discontented members of the French bourgeoise wanted a more efficient government, a larger voice in political affairs, and a more open society.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>PHILOSOPHE CRITICISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The French philosophes believed that human reason would inevitably lead to social progress.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Philosophes argued that France’s rigid social structure violated every rule of reason by maintaining an outdated status quo that protected the privileges of a favored few.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The philosophes advanced a message of liberty and equality that undermined the legitimacy of French monarchs, who ruled by divine right.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CALLING THE ESTATES GENERAL</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Both Louis XV and Louis XVI enjoyed extravagant lifestyles that created a massive public debt.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The cost of fighting the Seven Years’ War and financing the American War for Independence dramatically worsened the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>By the spring of 1789, the imminent threat of bankruptcy confronted Louis XVI with a grave crisis. His finance ministers hoped to avoid bankruptcy by taxing the nobles. However, the nobles refused to pay taxes unless the king called a meeting of the Estates General, which had not met since 1614. Louis reluctantly summoned representatives of the three estates to meet at Versailles on May 5, 1789.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_153"/>B.</strong></span><strong>THE THREE ESTATES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The First Estate: the clergy</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Catholic Church held about 20 percent of the land.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The French clergy paid no direct taxes. Instead, they gave the government a “free gift” of about 2 percent of their income.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Second Estate: the nobility</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Nobles comprised 2 to 4 percent of the population.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Nobles owned about 25 percent of the land.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Third Estate: everyone else</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Third Estate comprised 95 percent of the population.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>It included a diverse group of peasant farmers, urban workers, middle-class shopkeepers, wealthy merchants, and successful lawyers.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Those in this group resented aristocratic privileges.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE TENNIS COURT OATH, JUNE 1789</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Members of the First and Second Estates assumed that each estate would receive one vote. This traditional would enable them to impose their will on the Third Estate.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>This dispute represented more than a struggle over procedure. It marked a struggle for power between those who wanted to preserve their privileges and those who wanted a more equal and open society.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Abbé Sieyès, a previously unknown clergyman, became the Third Estate’s leading spokesman. In a bold pamphlet, he asked “What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been until now in the political order? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something.” Sieyès’ pointed questions and forceful answers emboldened members of the Third Estate and energized the push for reform at the Estates General.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Faced with continued royal resistance, the Third Estate defied the king by declaring itself the National Assembly of France. Locked out of their official meeting place, the Third Estate deputies gathered in an indoor tennis court where they took an oath “never to separate, and to meet wherever circumstances might require, until a constitution should be firmly established.”</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_154"/>5<span class="C504">.</span>The Tennis Court Oath marked the beginning of the French Revolution. In effect, the Third Estate deputies proclaimed an end to absolute monarchy and the beginning of representative government.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE STORMING OF THE BASTILLE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Determined to reassert royal authority, Louis XVI ordered a mercenary army of Swiss guards to march toward Paris and Versailles.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In Paris, angry mobs were already protesting the soaring price of bread. As tensions rose, a mob stormed the Bastille, a royal fortress and prison. The mob freed a handful of prisoners and seized the Bastille’s supply of gunpowder and weapons.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The fall of the Bastille marked an important symbolic act against royal despotism. It also pushed Paris to the forefront of the ongoing revolution.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND CITIZEN, AUGUST 1789</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The National Assembly adopted the <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen</em> on August 26, 1789. Written primarily by Abbé Sieyès and the Marquis de Lafayette (in consultation with Thomas Jefferson who was in Paris at the time), the Declaration embodied the Enlightenment principles of natural rights, limited government, and religious toleration.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Declaration began by forthrightly declaring, “Men are born free and remain free and equal in rights.” These rights included “liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.”</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Declaration provided for freedom of religion, freedom from arbitrary arrest, freedom of speech and the press, and the right to petition the government.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Declaration further established the principle that laws could be made and taxes levied only by the citizens or their representatives. The nation, not the king, was sovereign.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The Declaration was a landmark in the fight against privilege and despotism.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_155"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>French laws excluding women from voting and holding office contradicted the soaring ideals announced in the <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</em>.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Politically active women published pamphlets, organized clubs, and petitioned the National Assembly to demand more rights and a greater voice in public affairs.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1791, Olympe de Gouges composed a <em>Declaration of the Rights of Women</em> in which she declared, “Woman is born free and lives equal to men in her rights.” She further insisted that “male and female citizens being equal in the eyes of the law, must be equally admitted to all honors, positions, and public employment.”</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>In 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft published <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em>. She argued that women are not naturally inferior to men. The appearance of inferiority is created by a lack of education.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>French women did gain increased rights to inherit property and to divorce. However, male revolutionaries reacted disdainfully to the idea of female political participation. As a result, women did not gain the right to vote or to hold office.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE WOMEN’S MARCH TO VERSAILLES, OCTOBER 1789</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Food shortages in Paris sparked yet another popular explosion. On October 5, 1789, a crowd of several thousand hungry, angry, and desperate women marched 12 miles from Paris to Versailles.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The <em>poissardes</em>, or Parisian market women demanded cheap bread and insisted that the royal family move to Paris.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Fearing for his safety, Louis XVI quickly capitulated. On October 6, 1789, the royal family left Versailles accompanied by a triumphant crowd of shouting poissardes. The royal family established themselves in a palace located at the center of Paris. A few days later, the deputies of the National Assembly moved to Paris.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Like the fall of the Bastille, the women’s march to Versailles demonstrated the newfound power of ordinary people to influence the course of historic events.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_156"/>E.</strong></span><strong>THE CIVIL CONSTITUTION OF THE CLERGY, AUGUST 1790</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>This act, passed by the National Assembly, did the following:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Confiscated the lands owned by the Roman Catholic Church</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Decreed that bishops and priests would be elected by the people and paid by the state</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Required the clergy to take a loyalty oath to support the new government</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>It is important to note that Pope Pius VI condemned the act and that over half of the clergy refused to take the oath of allegiance. Alienated Catholics proved to be persistent opponents of the French Revolution.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>REFORMS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The National Assembly</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>created a constitutional monarchy</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>divided France into 83 departments governed by elected officials</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>established the metric system of measurement</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>abolished internal tariffs</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>abolished guilds</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The National Assembly did <em>not</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>abolish private property</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>give women the right to vote</p>

<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Conservatives who favored a constitutional monarchy made up the Right.</p>

<p class="C515"><span id="page_157"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>Radicals who distrusted the king and wanted the Revolution to continue sat to the Left. The Left was divided into two groups:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Jacobins wanted to overthrow the monarchy and create a republic. Key Jacobin leaders included Jean-Paul Marat, Georges-Jacques Danton, and Maximilien de Robespierre. Note that the Marquis de Lafayette was not a Jacobin.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Girondists wanted to involve France in a war that would discredit the monarchy and extend France’s revolutionary ideals across Europe.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FRANCE VERSUS AUSTRIA AND PRUSSIA</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Leopold II of Austria and Frederick William II of Prussia issued the Declaration of Pillnitz (August 1791) declaring that the restoration of absolutism in France was of “common interest to all sovereigns of Europe.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria and Prussia in April 1792, thus beginning the War of the First Coalition.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The war began badly for the poorly equipped French armies. By the summer of 1792, Austrian and Prussian armies were advancing toward Paris.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SECOND FRENCH REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Faced with defeat, recruits rushed to Paris singing the <em>Marseillaise</em>, a stirring appeal to save France from tyranny. The rejuvenated French forces stopped the Austro-Prussian army, thus saving the Revolution.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>During the summer of 1792, radicals called sans-culottes (literally “without breeches”) took control of the Paris Commune (city government). The revolutionary Paris Commune intimidated the Legislative Assembly into deposing Louis XVI and issuing a call for the election of a national convention. This new body would then form a more democratic government.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_158"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Violence once again exploded in Paris. Convinced that royalists would betray the Revolution, mobs of sans-culottes executed over a thousand priests, bourgeoisie, and aristocrats. These “September massacres” marked the beginning of a second French Revolution dominated by radicals.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE EXECUTION OF LOUIS XVI</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The newly elected National Convention abolished the monarchy and declared that France was now a republic in which every adult citizen had the right to vote and hold office. Women could not vote, however, despite the important role they had already played in the Revolution.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The National Convention then had to decide Louis XVI’s fate. The Girondists favored imprisonment while the Jacobins demanded that he be executed as a tyrant and a traitor.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>After a contentious debate, the National Convention passed a resolution condemning Louis XVI to death. The resolution passed by one vote.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Supported by the sans-culottes, the Jacobins branded the Girondins as counterrevolutionaries and ousted them from the National Convention.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>EUROPEAN REACTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>At first, European liberals supported the French Revolution and applauded the fall of the Old Regime.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The English statesman Edmund Burke offered a conservative critique of the French Revolution. Burke warned that mob rule would lead to anarchy and ultimately military dictatorship. To many moderate Europeans, the September massacres and the execution of Louis XVI vindicated Burke’s dire predictions.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC THREATS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>England, Spain, Holland, and Sardinia joined with Prussia and Austria. In the spring of 1793, First Coalition armies converged on France.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_159"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Internal strife also threatened the National Convention. Girondists and royalist Catholics rebelled against the tyranny of radical Jacobins.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE REIGN OF TERROR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The execution of Louis XVI did not solve the National Convention’s problems. Foreign armies still threatened France’s borders. The Jacobins also had thousands of enemies within France itself—peasants horrified by the beheading of the king, priests who refused to accept government controls, and rival leaders who stirred up rebellion outside of Paris.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Faced with foreign invaders and the threat of domestic rebellion, the National Convention established the Committee of Public Safety to defend France and safeguard the Revolution.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Robespierre, the Committee of Public Safety exercised dictatorial power as it carried out a Reign of Terror.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The guillotine quickly became the supreme symbol of the Terror. In the name of creating a Republic of Virtue, Robespierre executed the queen, his chief rivals, and thousands of “dangerous” class enemies including Olympe de Gouges.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE REPUBLIC OF VIRTUE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Robespierre and his supporters launched a cultural revolution designed to create a “Republic of Virtue.” Their campaign to “republicanize everything” affected all aspects of French life. For example, the figure of Liberty appeared on coins, bills, and letterheads. Decks of cards no longer had kings, queens, and jacks. Instead, they had cards called liberties, equalities, and fraternities.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>As believers in reason, the Jacobins wanted to make their calendar scientific. They divided the year into 12 months of 30 days and gave each month a new, “reasonable” name. For example, October was renamed Brumaire of Fog Month. The new calendar had no Sundays because the radicals considered religion a bastion of superstition.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The elimination of Sunday was part of a campaign of de-Christianization that included both Catholic and Protestant churches. Zealous Jacobins dismantled church bells and beheaded medieval statues of kings on the façade of Notre Dame cathedral.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_160"/>F.</strong></span><strong>THE “NATION IN ARMS”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>While the Terror crushed domestic dissent, Robespierre turned to the danger posed by the First Coalition. In 1793, the Committee of Public Safety proclaimed a “levée en masse” decreeing compulsory military service for all able-bodied men aged 18 to 25.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The levée en masse created a national military based upon mass participation. This marked the first example of the complete mobilization of a country for war.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Motivated by patriotism and led by a corps of talented young officers that included Napoleon Bonaparte, France’s citizen-soldiers defeated the First Coalition’s professional armies.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The French forces posed as liberators who abolished feudal dues as they spread their revolutionary message of liberty and equality.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>G.</strong></span><strong>THE THERMIDORIAN REACTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Committee of Public Safety successfully crushed internal dissent and defeated the First Coalition. Despite these victories, Robespierre continued to pursue his fanatical dream of creating a Republic of Virtue.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Fearing for their lives and yearning for stability, the National Convention reasserted its authority by executing Robespierre.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Robespierre’s death ended the radical phase of the French Revolution. On the new revolutionary calendar, July was called <em>Thermidor</em> from the French word for “heat.” Hence, the revolt against Robespierre is called the Thermidorian reaction.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The French Revolution replaced the Bourbon monarchy with a republic. <em>The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</em> became a foundational document for the cause of liberty and human rights. France became the first nation to grant universal male suffrage.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The French Revolution played a key role in the rise of modern nationalism. French citizens no longer identified themselves as members of an estate. Instead, they pledged allegiance to their nation above other individual or group interests.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>WESTERN EUROPE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>France’s rejuvenated army conquered the Austrian Netherlands, the Dutch Republic, areas of Germany on the left bank of the Rhine River, Switzerland, and most of Italy. They promptly abolished feudal privileges and taxes.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The people living in France’s “sister republics” originally greeted the French as welcome liberators. However, as France’s rule became more and more oppressive, people began to resent the French and become more aware of their own national identity.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE UNITED STATES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>America’s founders hoped that the new republic would avoid developing permanent political parties. However, Alexander Hamilton’s financial program stimulated the formation of two political factions—Hamilton’s Federalists and Thomas Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The outbreak of the French Revolution further deepened these divisions. Hamilton and his supporters were outspoken supporters of Great Britain and opponents of France. In contrast, Jefferson and his supporters were openly pro-French. These differences played a key role in the formation of America’s two-party system.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_162"/>D.</strong></span><strong>HAITI</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Haiti was a French colony called Saint-Domingue (later named Haiti). The island’s lucrative sugar plantations made it the most profitable French colony in the world.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>When the French Revolution began, the population of Saint-Domingue included 30,000 whites, 28,000 people of color, and 465,000 slaves.</p>
<p class="C515"><span class="C467">3</span> The soaring ideals of the French Revolution inspired the island’s slaves and free people of color to demand their freedom. Toussaint L’Ouverture emerged as a charismatic leader who played a key role in helping Haitians win their independence.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The successful slave uprising led to the founding of an independent state that was both free from slavery and ruled by non-whites and former captives.</p>
