<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>PHILIP’S EMPIRE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Emperor Charles V abdicated his many thrones in 1556. He left his territories in Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary to his brother Ferdinand.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Charles left his son Philip a vast empire that included Spain, Milan, Naples, the Netherlands, and the overseas empire in the Americas.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>PHILIP’S GOALS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>To advance Spanish power in Europe</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>To champion Catholicism in Europe</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>To defeat the Ottoman Turks in the eastern Mediterranean</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>BATTLE OF LEPANTO, 1571</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>A combined Spanish-Venetian fleet defeated the Turkish navy at Lepanto off the coast of Greece.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The victory enhanced Philip’s prestige as a champion of Catholicism.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE DEFEAT OF PHILIP: THE NETHERLANDS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>When Philip succeeded to the throne, the Spanish Netherlands consisted of 17 largely Catholic provinces.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Philip threatened traditional liberties by imposing the Inquisition and dispatching troops to support it. Philip’s ill-considered actions provoked riots against the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_72"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Philip responded to this challenge by sending 20,000 additional troops. Led by the ruthless Duke of Alva, the Spaniards levied new taxes and sentenced thousands to death.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Alva’s brutal actions united the Netherlands against the Spanish. During the struggle, many showed their opposition to Spain by converting to Calvinism.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>A new Spanish viceroy, the Duke of Parma, adopted more skillful tactics. By substituting diplomacy for force, Parma was able to induce the ten southern provinces to reaffirm their loyalty to Spain.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Led by the province of Holland, the Dutch in the seven northern provinces could not be won back. In 1581, they boldly declared their independence from Spain.</p>
<p class="C515">7<span class="C504">.</span>The war for control of the Netherlands continued until 1609. Under the terms of a truce, the 7 northern and now heavily Calvinist provinces gained their independence and were known as Dutch. The 10 Catholic southern provinces were known as the Spanish Netherlands.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE DEFEAT OF PHILIP: ENGLAND</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The English felt threatened by Philip’s aggressive actions in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Queen Elizabeth openly assisted the Dutch rebels with money and troops. She also encouraged English sea captains to raid Spanish treasure ships.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Outraged by Elizabeth’s interference, Philip assembled a huge fleet known as the Spanish Armada to invade England. Philip hoped to depose Elizabeth and return England to Catholicism.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Harassed by fast English ships, the powerful but slow-moving Spanish Armada never reached England. Only 67 of the Armada’s original 130 ships returned to Spain.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES OF PHILIP’S DEFEATS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Although still a formidable military power, Spain began a long period of political and economic decline.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Now independent, the Dutch began a golden age of commercial prosperity and artistic creativity.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_73"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>As Spain’s influence declined, England’s power increased. The English were now free to develop their overseas trade and to colonize North America.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE CATHOLICS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>As we have seen (see <a href="14_Chapter_5The_New_Monarchs.html#page_41">Chapter 5</a>), under the terms of the Concordat of Bologna (1516), Francis I recognized the supremacy of the papacy over a universal council. In return, French rulers gained the right to appoint all French bishops and abbots.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>As a result of the Concordat of Bologna, the ruling Valois kings had no reason to support a revolt against Rome.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE HUGUENOTS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Despite royal opposition, Calvinist ideas gained a strong foothold in France. By the 1560s, one-tenth of France’s 18 million people had become Calvinists, also known as Huguenots.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Calvinism had special appeal to French nobles. By the 1560s, between two-fifths and one-half of the nobility had become Calvinists. For many nobles, Calvinism provided a means of expressing opposition to the Valois kings.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE SAINT BARTHOLOMEW’S DAY MASSACRE, 1572</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The growing strength of the Huguenots alarmed the French king Charles IX and his powerful mother Catherine de’ Medici.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>With Catherine’s support, Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots who had gathered in Paris to celebrate the wedding of Margaret of Valois to the Huguenot leader Henry of Navarre. The violence quickly spread to the provinces, where as many as 20,000 Huguenots were killed.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Saint Bartholomew’s Day massacre ignited a bloody civil war between Catholics and Huguenots that continued for 15 years.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE POLITIQUES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The civil war devastated French agriculture and commerce.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_74"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>A small group of moderate Catholics and Huguenots realized that the disorder and destruction had to be stopped or France would collapse. Known as politiques, they supported a strong monarchy and official recognition of the Huguenots.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The death of Catherine de’ Medici followed by the assassinations of the powerful Catholic Duke of Guise and King Henry III paved the way for the accession of Henry of Navarre, a leading politique who became Henry IV in 1589.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE EDICT OF NANTES, 1598</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Henry IV was the leader of the House of Bourbon and a Huguenot.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Many Catholics, including the people of Paris, still opposed Henry. Knowing that a majority of the French were Catholics, Henry chose to become a Catholic, saying, “Paris is worth a mass.”</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In 1598, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes proclaiming the toleration of Calvinism and recognizing the rights of French Protestants.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Henry’s decision to convert and issue the Edict of Nantes saved France and prepared the way for the resurgence of royal power in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE IN 1600</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Holy Roman Empire included approximately 300 small principalities, duchies, and independent cities.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 (see <a href="17_Chapter_7The_Protestant_Reformat.html#page_55">Chapter 7</a>) gave each German prince the right to determine the religion of his state, either Roman Catholic or Lutheran.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_75"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>The Peace of Augsburg did not provide for the recognition of Calvinists. Nonetheless, a number of states, including the Palatinate, had adopted Calvinism.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES OF THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Unresolved conflicts</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Unresolved religious hatreds, economic rivalries, and competing dynastic ambitions continued to divide European society.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The spread of Calvinism introduced a new source of friction because Calvinists had been excluded from the Peace of Augsburg.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Religious divisions</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>In 1608, the Protestant states formed the Protestant Union to defend their interests.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The following year the Catholic states formed the Catholic League to defend their interests.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>By 1609 two military alliances faced each other within the Holy Roman Empire. Each alliance was determined to prevent its rival from making any further gains.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Political divisions</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Austrian Habsburgs wanted to reverse the Protestant gains while building a stronger monarchy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The German principalities and independent cities were jealous of their rights and resisted any attempt at centralization.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>International interference</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>France opposed any policy that would create a strong power in Germany. So, although France was a Catholic power, it allied itself with Protestant princes.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Lutheran kings of Denmark and Sweden were prepared to defend Protestant interests in the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE FOUR PHASES OF THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Bohemian Phase, 1618–1625</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Bohemia was a small but flourishing kingdom in which Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists lived peaceably together under earlier Habsburg promises of toleration.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_76"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>However, their new ruler Ferdinand II was an Austrian Habsburg and a zealous Catholic who undermined religious toleration by closing the Protestant churches.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Thirty Years’ War began as a religious civil war in Bohemia between the Catholic League led by Emperor Ferdinand II and the Protestant Union led by Frederick V.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Emperor Ferdinand II’s forces won a series of overwhelming victories that left the Habsburgs and Catholics in control of Bohemia.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Danish Phase, 1625–1629</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The fall of Bohemia alarmed Protestants. Supported by the Dutch and English, the Danish king, Christian IV, intervened to support the Protestants and to gain territory in northern Germany.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Led by Albrecht von Wallenstein, the imperial armies crushed the Protestant forces.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Flushed with victory, Emperor Ferdinand issued the Edict of Restitution restoring all Catholic properties lost to the Protestants since 1552.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Swedish Phase, 1630–1635</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Deeply unsettled by the Catholic victories, the Protestants, Dutch, and French turned for help to the Lutheran king of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>A charismatic ruler and brilliant military strategist, Gustavus Adolphus led a disciplined, well-equipped army. A sincere champion of Lutheranism, Gustavus hoped to create a federation of Protestant states in Germany under Swedish leadership.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Gustavus defeated Wallenstein in a series of decisive battles. The Swedish victories prevented the Habsburgs from uniting the German states.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The French Phase, 1635–1648</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The unexpected death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632, forced Cardinal Richelieu of France to act. As a politique he was willing to disregard his religious beliefs in favor of pursuing French national interests. Although a Catholic nation, France intervened on the Protestant side to prevent a united Germany on its eastern border. The war thus became a power struggle <span id="page_77"/>between France and Sweden on one side and the Habsburg Empire and Spain on the other.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The French, Dutch, and Swedish armies proved to be an irresistible force. They ravaged Germany and compelled the Catholic powers to begin serious negotiations.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA, 1648</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The setting</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Hundreds of diplomats representing the German states, France, Sweden, Spain, the Dutch, and the pope met in Westphalia. This marked the first war in modern history ended by a peace conference.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Although represented at Westphalia, the pope’s objections were largely ignored, underscoring the degree of secularization taking place in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The provisions</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Each of the over 300 German states received the right to conduct diplomacy and make treaties.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Rulers were allowed to decide the religious faith in their territory. Calvinism was recognized as an acceptable faith.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The independence of the Dutch Republic and neutrality of Switzerland were formally recognized.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The French annexed portions of Alsace and Lorraine.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>Sweden received additional territory around the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>CONSEQUENCES OF THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>For Protestants and Catholics</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Thirty Years’ War reaffirmed and extended the principle of <em>cuius regio, eius religio</em> (“Whose the region, his the religion”). As a result, the European powers officially recognized Calvinism as a politically accepted faith.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Thirty Years’ War marked the decline of papal political influence. The European powers ignored the papal representative at the Westphalia negotiations. The pope never signed the treaties known together as the Peace of Westphalia.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_78"/><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Thirty Years’ War ended the wars of religion. The long war reduced religious differences as a source of conflict. The end of the Thirty Years’ War thus marks the beginning of the rise of religious toleration in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>For the German States</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Thirty Years’ War devastated the German economy and decimated its population. As many as one-third of the German-speaking people died from disease, famine, and combat.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Germany’s long-term commercial growth suffered because the Treaty of Westphalia gave control of the mouth of the Rhine River to the Dutch.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Thirty Years’ War left Germany politically fragmented into more than 300 virtually sovereign states that had the right to ratify laws, collect taxes, and wage war. This fragmentation ended the Holy Roman Empire as an effective entity and delayed German unification for two centuries.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>For France</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>France achieved its primary goals of weakening the Habsburgs and keeping the Holy Roman Empire weak and divided.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>France received portions of Alsace and Lorraine.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>France emerged as the strongest power in Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>For Military Strategy</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Thirty Years’ War led to the formation of professional fighting forces that were not disbanded at the end of the fighting.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The size of national armies increased dramatically. For example, the French army doubled in size from 125,000 men to 250,000 men.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The dramatic growth in the size of national armies required more complex bureaucracies and an increase in taxes to fund the enlarged military establishments.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_79"/>5<span class="C504">.</span>For Diplomacy</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Peace of Westphalia established a new European balance of power that included fragmented German states, strengthened French power, and Dutch independence.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Peace of Westphalia established the modern system of diplomatic relations among mutually recognized sovereign states.</p>
