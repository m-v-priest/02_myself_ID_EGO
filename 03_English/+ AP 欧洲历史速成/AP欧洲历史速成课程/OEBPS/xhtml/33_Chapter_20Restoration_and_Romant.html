</table>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ELABORATE POMP</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The crowned heads of Austria, Prussia, Russia, and dozens of lesser states along with the ministers of nearly every European government assembled in Vienna, Austria, in the fall of 1814.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Austrians entertained their guests with elegant balls, lavish dinners, festive fireworks, and concerts by Beethoven.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>SERIOUS DELIBERATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Prince Klemens von Metternich, the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, the great powers conducted serious negotiations to redraw the map of Europe and attempt to create a durable peace.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_173"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Like the other aristocratic dignitaries, Metternich opposed the forces of liberalism and nationalism unleashed by the French Revolution and Napoleon. He believed in the value of maintaining the status quo. “The first and greatest concern for the immense majority of every nation,” Metternich insisted, “is the stability of laws—never their change.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGITIMACY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Legitimacy meant restoring ruling families that had been deposed by the French Revolution and Napoleon.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>As the younger brother of Louis XVI, Louis XVIII returned as the legitimate Bourbon ruler of France.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Bourbon rulers were also returned to their thrones in Spain and Naples.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Congress restored the House of Orange in Holland and the House of Savoy in Sardinia-Piedmont.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE BALANCE OF POWER</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The leaders at Vienna wanted to weaken France so that it would no longer be able to wage wars of aggression and threaten the balance of power.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>At the same time, the victorious powers did not want to impose a punitive treaty that would humiliate and antagonize France.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>France was forced to return to its 1790 borders and to pay an indemnity of 700 million francs. However, France was allowed to keep most of its overseas possessions, its army, and an independent government.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>To keep France from renewing its drive for power, the Congress encircled France with strengthened powers:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Austrian Netherlands was united with the Dutch Republic to form a single kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>A group of 39 German states were loosely joined into a newly created German Confederation, dominated by Austria.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Congress recognized Switzerland as an independent and neutral nation.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The Kingdom of Sardinia in Italy was strengthened by the addition of Piedmont and Savoy.</p>
<p class="C499"><span id="page_174"/><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>TERRITORIAL SETTLEMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Russia acquired more Polish territory.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Sweden retained Norway.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Prussia acquired two-fifths of Saxony and territory in the Rhineland along the border of France.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Austria acquired the northern Italian provinces of Lombardy and Venetia as compensation for its loss of Belgium.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Britain gained valuable territories for its overseas empire, including Malta, the Cape of Good Hope, Trinidad, and Tobago.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>EVALUATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Congress of Vienna negotiated the most extensive European settlements since the agreements at Westphalia in 1648. The decisions proved to be acceptable to both the victors and to France.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>It created a framework for peace that prevented a war among the great powers for forty years. No wars of worldwide dimensions occurred for a full century.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>It created a balance of power that lasted until the unification of Germany in 1871.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>It represented a temporary triumph for the conservative order. The leaders of the Congress of Vienna could not contain the forces of liberalism and nationalism unleashed by the French Revolution.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Swept across Europe during the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Influenced religion, art, music, and philosophy.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Inspired a desire for freedom of thought, feeling, and action.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KEY CHARACTERISTICS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The primacy of emotion</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Enlightenment stressed reason as a way to understand nature.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_175"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>Romantics rejected reason, and instead stressed emotion, intuition, and subjective feelings. The German novelist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe emphasized the importance of feeling over thinking when he wrote, “What I know, anyone can know, but my heart is my own, peculiar to itself.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>A different past</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Neoclassical artists looked to Greece and Rome for models of order and clarity.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Romantics looked to the medieval period for models of chivalrous heroes, miraculous events, and unsolved mysteries. The deeds of legendary kings and knights seemed more worthy of song and story than those of contemporary factory owners and railway engineers.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>A new view of nature</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Enlightened thinkers relied on the scientific method to study and understand nature. They viewed nature as a well-ordered machine.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Romantics preferred to contemplate the beauty of nature. They were inspired by raging rivers, gathering storms, and majestic mountains veiled in mist. These natural wonders were a source of spiritual inspiration that evoked feelings of awe and wonder.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Heroic individuals</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Enlightened thinkers and artists depicted disciplined heroes who relied on reason and exhibited self-restraint.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Romantic artists celebrated heroic rebels who acted spontaneously and overcame the constraints place on them by governments, religions, and societal conventions. For example, the British poet Lord Byron became a Romantic hero when he rushed off to fight and die in the Greek war for independence from the Turks.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: ENLIGHTENED AND ROMANTIC VIEWS OF RELIGION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Enlightenment embraced a mechanical view of human nature and the physical world. Enlightened thinkers rejected faith and instead relied on a rational, scientific approach to understand the relationship between human beings and the natural world. The Enlightenment favored the deist view that a distant God created <span id="page_176"/>the natural world and, like a “divine watchmaker,” stepped back from his creation and humanity’s daily concerns.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Romantics believed in a loving, personal God. They stressed emotions, inner faith, and religious inspiration. Romantics embraced the wonders and mysteries of nature as a way to feel the divine presence.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>KEY ROMANTIC WRITERS, ARTISTS, AND COMPOSERS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Writers</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>—a collection of poems that mark the beginning of the English Romantic movement in poetry.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Friedrich Schiller, “Ode to Joy”—celebrates the unity of all humankind.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, <em>Grimm’s Fairy Tales</em>—a collection of over 200 German folk stories that illustrate the fusion of nationalism and romanticism.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Artists</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Caspar David Friedrich, <em>The Wanderer Above the Mists</em>—depicts a lonely but captivating traveler standing on a mountain peak contemplating a mysterious and awesome vista that can be dimly seen through the surrounding mist.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Eugène Delacroix, <em>Liberty Leading the People</em>—depicts working and middle-class citizens united by their common yearning for liberty.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>John Constable, <em>The Hay Wain</em>—portrays a farmer and his hay wagon as integral and harmonious parts of the natural landscape.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Composers</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Ludwig van Beethoven, Ninth Symphony—incorporates Schiller’s “Ode to Joy” into a soaring presentation of human emotions.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Richard Wagner, “The Ring of the Nibelung”—fuses music and drama by reshaping ancient Germanic myths into a story of how unselfish love finally triumphs over the obsessive pursuit of money and power.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_177"/>E.</strong></span><strong>ROMANTICISM AND NATIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Romantic authors believed in revolutionary movements that would give people more freedom and control over their lives. By studying the past, writers helped make people aware of their common heritage. The resurgence of national feeling sparked nationalist movements across Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>German authors placed special emphasis on the common historic. Cultural, and linguistic ties that bound together the “Volk” or living “national community.” For example, the Grimm brothers published a large collection of fairy tales they believed expressed the authentic spirt of German culture.</p>
