<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>During the late 1400s, students and artists from Northern Europe traveled to Italy where they became acquainted with the “new learning” and the new style of painting.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>At the same time, merchants from the Low Countries, as well as France, Germany, and England, also visited Italy and learned about the advances of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CHRISTIAN HUMANISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Northern humanists were often called Christian humanists. Like their Italian counterparts, the Christian humanists closely studied classical sources. However, they also sought to give humanism a specifically Christian context.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Christian humanists wanted to combine the classical ideals of calmness and stoical patience with the Christian virtues of piety, humility, and love. They believed that this fusion would create the best code of virtuous conduct.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Christian humanists were committed to moral and institutional reform.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>DESIDERIUS ERASMUS (1466–1536)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Known as the “prince of the humanists,” Erasmus was the most famous and influential humanist of the Northern Renaissance.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The greatest scholar of his age, Erasmus edited the works of the Church Fathers and produced Greek and Latin editions of the New Testament.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Erasmus is best known for writing <em>The Praise of Folly</em>, a witty satire that poked fun at greedy merchants, pompous priests, and quarrelsome scholars. Erasmus saved his most stinging barbs for the immorality and hypocrisy of church leaders, including Pope Julius II.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Erasmus was a devout Catholic committed to reforming the church from within. He called for the Church to return to simple, essential Christianity. Erasmus stressed that true religion was a matter of inward sincerity and pious devotion rather than outward observances such as pilgrimages or venerating relics.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>Erasmus’s hope for peaceful reform was shattered when Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THOMAS MORE (1478–1535)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>More was the leading humanist scholar in England. A renowned author, lawyer, and statesman, More held many high public offices including lord chancellor under Henry VIII.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>More is best known for writing <em>Utopia</em> (meaning “Nowhere”), a novel describing an imaginary society located somewhere off the mainland of the New World. The country of Utopia featured religious toleration, a humanist education for both men and women, and communal ownership of property.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE (1533–1592)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Montaigne was one of the most influential writers of the French Renaissance.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>He is best known for popularizing the essay as a literary genre. Montaigne’s writings feature numerous vivid anecdotes and a <span id="page_37"/>skeptical tone best illustrated by his famous question, <em>Que sais-je?</em> (“What do I know?”).</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>JOHANNES GUTENBERG AND THE PRINTING PRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Johannes Gutenberg is credited with inventing the first printing press with movable type. In 1456, the first full work ever printed by movable type, the Mazarin Bible, was published.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Printing quickly spread across Europe. The Low Countries along with prosperous Italian and German cities became early centers of the printing revolution.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>By 1500, presses in over 200 cities printed copies of about 40,000 books, pamphlets, and broadsides. Historians estimate that as many as 10 million items may have been printed, far more than the number of books produced in all of previous Western history.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>IMPACT OF THE PRINTING PRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The ideas of Petrarch and other early Renaissance humanists spread slowly from person to person by a laborious process of hand copying. In contrast, the printing revolution enabled the ideas of Erasmus, Montaigne, and More to spread rapidly across Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The diffusion of learning stimulated scholarship and exposed more people to fresh ideas.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The printing revolution promoted the growth of vernacular literature and national cultures.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Printing technology enhanced royal authority by enabling monarchs to print laws and spread propaganda.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>At the same time, the printing revolution undermined the authority of the Church. For example, printing presses disseminated Luther’s revolutionary ideas, thus helping to promote the Protestant Revolution.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CHARACTERISTICS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Northern Renaissance artists were the first to use and perfect oil painting.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The new oil paints enabled Renaissance artists to paint reality precisely as it appeared. Their works are renowned for meticulous details of everyday objects.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Many of the everyday objects in Northern Renaissance paintings are actually disguised symbols. For example, in <em>The Arnolfini Wedding</em>, the dog represents fidelity and the discarded shoes are a sign that a religious ceremony is taking place. At the time, people believed that touching the ground with bare feet ensured fertility.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KEY ARTISTS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Jan van Eyck (1390–1441)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Van Eyck was the most acclaimed Flemish artist of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>He was one of the pioneers in oil painting.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Van Eyck is best known for the <em>Ghent Altarpiece</em> and <em>The Arnolfini Wedding</em>.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_39"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Dürer was the first Northern Renaissance artist to fully absorb the innovations of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>He is best known for his woodcuts and self-portraits.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Like Dürer, Holbein blended the Northern Renaissance’s love of precise realism with the Italian Renaissance’s love of balanced proportion and perspective.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>His best-known works are his realistic portraits of Henry VIII and Thomas More.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The portraits of Henry VIII are an excellent example of how portraits were used to visually express the rising power of the new monarchs.</p>
