<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>KEY POINTS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Once the unifying threat of Nazi Germany disappeared, the United States and the Soviet Union began to quarrel over long-standing political and ideological disputes. For example, President Truman demanded that Stalin permit free elections throughout Eastern Europe. The Soviet dictator adamantly refused, declaring, “A freely elected government in any of these East European countries would be anti-Soviet, and that we cannot allow.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Soviet Union soon dominated a sphere of influence in much of Eastern Europe. Soviet-backed communist parties pushed aside opposition groups until they exercised unchallenged authority. Winston Churchill warned America that “an iron curtain has descended across the continent.”</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Truman adopted containment as a foreign policy designed to contain or block Soviet expansion.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Containment became the primary U.S. foreign policy from the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The immediate goal of the Truman Doctrine was to block the expansion of Soviet influence into Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>On March 12, 1947, President Harry Truman asked Congress for $400 million in economic aid for Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Truman justified the aid by declaring that the United States would support “free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugations by <span id="page_284"/>armed minorities or by outside pressures.” This sweeping pledge became known as the Truman Doctrine.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE MARSHALL PLAN</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>World War II devastated large parts of Europe. Desperate Europeans faced acute shortages of food, fuel, and industrial raw materials. In both 1946 and 1947, agricultural and industrial production in all European countries fell below pre-war levels. Economic weakness threatened political instability, making Europe vulnerable to Soviet influence.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Truman administration recognized that the shattered European economy required a massive infusion of economic assistance. The Marshall Plan was a program of economic aid designed to promote the recovery of war-torn Europe while also preventing the spread of Soviet influence.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Marshall Plan aid began flowing into Europe in 1948. During the next 4 years, 16 Western European countries received $13 billion, the equivalent of about $200 billion in 2019. The Marshall Plan helped alleviate food shortages and stimulate industrial production.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Marshall Plan was an integral part of Truman’s policy of containment.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The Marshall Plan dramatically increased American political and economic influence in Western and Southern Europe.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE NATO ALLIANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Ten Western European nations joined with the United States and Canada to form a defensive military alliance called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO coordinated defense preparations among the nations of Western Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>NATO featured an American commitment to permanently station troops in Western Europe. The NATO alliance thus marked a decisive break from America’s tradition of isolationism.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>THE WARSAW PACT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Soviet Union responded to NATO by forming the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The alliance linked the Soviet Union with seven Eastern European countries: Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, <span id="page_285"/>Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania. The Cold War thus divided Europe into two rival blocs.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>THE BERLIN AIRLIFT</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Allies failed to agree on a peace treaty with Germany.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1945, the Allies divided Germany into four occupation zones, one each for the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The city of Berlin lay 110 miles inside the Soviet occupation zone. Like Germany, it was divided into four occupation zones.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Fearing a resurgent Germany, the Soviet Union cut off Western land access to West Berlin. This action provoked the first great Cold War test of wills between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>President Truman ordered a massive airlift of food, fuel, and other supplies to the beleaguered citizens of West Berlin.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span>The Berlin Airlift marked a crucial and successful test of containment.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>Following the Berlin Airlift, the United States, Great Britain, and France created the Federal Republic of Germany or West Germany. The Soviet Union responded by establishing the East German state, the German Democratic Republic.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>G.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: THE TREATMENT OF GERMANY AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>After the First World War</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The German government asked for peace based on Wilson’s Fourteen Points.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Unaware that their army had been defeated, the German people expected a lenient postwar settlement.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Allies excluded Germany from the peace negotiations, thus justifying the German complaint that they were coerced to sign a dictated treaty.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The Versailles Treaty forced Germany to cede Alsace-Lorraine to France. In addition, the Polish Corridor separated part of East Prussia from the rest of Germany.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>The Allies originally excluded Germany from the League of Nations.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_286"/><span class="C521">vi.</span>France and Great Britain demanded that Germany pay heavy reparations for the cost of the war. The reparation payments were eventually renegotiated under the Dawes Plan.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>After the Second World War</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Allies demanded and received Germany’s unconditional surrender.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union agreed to disarm Germany and divide it into four occupation zones.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Poland gained lands in East Prussia.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>The Cold War led to the separation of Germany into West Germany and East Germany. West Germany became a member of the NATO alliance and East Germany became a member of the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>Marshall Plan aid helped revitalize the West German economy. West Germany soon boasted a strong industrial base that contrasted with the lagging economy in Soviet-dominated East Germany.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>When World War II ended, Europe faced a grim future. “What is Europe now?” Winston Churchill asked. “It is a rubble heap, a charnel house, a breeding ground for pestilence and hate.”</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Hunger and desperation stalked Europe from Bulgaria to Belgium. Tens of millions of homeless Europeans were classified as “displaced persons.”</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Despite these seemingly insurmountable problems, Europe staged a remarkable recovery that is often called an “economic miracle.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMIC INTEGRATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The European Coal and Steel Community</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Jean Monnet, a French economic planner, convinced French Premier Robert Schuman that economic cooperation would be the key to future prosperity between France and West Germany.</p>
<p class="C533"><span id="page_287"/><span class="C521">ii.</span>The Schuman Plan, as the project became known, led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC).</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The ECSC called for tariff-free trade in coal and steel among France, West Germany, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The European Economic Community (Common Market)</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The ECSC proved to be a success. As a result, in 1957 its six member nations signed the Treaty of Rome creating the European Economic Community (EEC), popularly known as the Common Market.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The EEC eliminated trade barriers among its members, thus closely resembling a tariff union.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The EEC rapidly emerged as the driving force behind economic integration in Western Europe.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE ECONOMIC MIRACLE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Sparked by Marshall Plan aid and revitalized by economic integration, Europe entered a period of rapid economic growth.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>By 1963, Western Europe produced over 2.5 times more goods than it did before World War II.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The booming West German economy soon dominated the European electrical, automobile, chemical, and steel industries. Between 1950 and 1980, West Germany’s gross national product (GNP), or the total value of goods and services produced, grew from $48 billion to an astounding $828 billion.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE WELFARE STATE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The term “welfare state” refers to the policy of post-World War II nations to establish safety nets for their citizens in areas of <span id="page_288"/>health care, disability insurance, unemployment insurance, and retirement pensions.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>These policies were a response to socialist demands for social justice and concerns over the strength of Communist parties in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Christian Democratic parties played a key role in supporting welfare state programs, European integration, national health insurance, aid to farmers, and political democracy.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>CHARLES DE GAULLE’S (1890–1970) INDEPENDENT POLICIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>General Charles de Gaulle established the Fifth French Republic in 1958. He served as president until 1969. De Gaulle followed an independent course that opposed close ties with America and continued European political and economic union.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>De Gaulle’s key foreign policy decisions included:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Granting Algeria full independence.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW IMPERIALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Between 1870 and 1914, European nations led by Great Britain and France brought much of the world under their direct control.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The European powers were motivated by a combination of factors including a desire to acquire raw materials, develop profitable foreign markets, protect strategic sea lanes, and bring the blessings of their superior technology to less advanced peoples.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>President Woodrow Wilson’s support for the principle of national self-determination inspired demands for greater independence. In addition, India and other nations expected more political sovereignty in exchange for their support in World War I.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_289"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>The Great Powers failed to meet these expectations. Instead, they tightened control over their colonies and established a mandate system in the Middle East. The British and French empires actually increased in size during the interwar period.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES OF DECOLONIZATION AFTER WORLD WAR II</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Decolonization refers to the process by which colonies gained their independence from the imperial powers after World War II.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Three key factors contributed to the rapid pace of decolonization. First, devastated by World War II, the imperial powers were barely able to support themselves in 1945, let alone rule expensive overseas colonies. Second, the horrors of World War II undermined European self-confidence and the moral justification for imperialism. And finally, led by a new generation of nationalist leaders, the demand for national self-determination intensified in Asia and Africa.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>BRITISH DECOLONIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The British Empire once included one-quarter of the world’s land area and 500 million of its people. However, Britain made the most dramatic break from imperialism.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1947, Britain negotiated an end to imperial rule in India. The settlement divided the subcontinent into a predominately Hindu India and a predominantly Muslim Pakistan.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Britain surrendered control of Palestine to the United Nations. Israel then declared its independence, igniting a war with neighboring Arab countries.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Britain continued the process of decolonization in Sub-Saharan Africa. Beginning with Ghana in 1957, British Sub-Saharan colonies achieved independence with little or no violence.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>FRENCH DECOLONIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Unlike Great Britain, France resisted decolonization.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>France attempted to reassert its control over Indochina. However, a resistance movement led by Ho Chi Minh declared independence after defeating French forces at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In Algeria, a bitter war broke out between French and Algerian nationalists. After a bloody struggle, French President Charles de <span id="page_290"/>Gaulle accepted Algerian self-determination. After more than a century of French rule, Algeria became independent in 1962.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Following World War II, Joseph Stalin imposed new Five-Year Plans emphasizing extensive industrialization.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Stalin insisted on absolute obedience. Dissent brought imprisonment, slave labor, or death.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Stalin’s long reign of terror came to an abrupt end with his death in 1953. Stalin’s legacy included industrialization, victory in World War II, expansion into Eastern Europe, and the transformation of the Soviet Union into a nuclear superpower. However, these achievements came with a heavy human price that included mass killings, the creation of a vast prison system known as the Gulag, and the building of a rigid totalitarian state.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>After a brief period of “collective leadership,” Nikita Khrushchev emerged as the Soviet Union’s unrivaled leader.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>KHRUSHCHEV’S SECRET SPEECH</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1956, Khrushchev boldly attacked Stalin in a “secret speech” delivered at the Twentieth Communist Party Congress in Moscow.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Khrushchev denounced Stalin’s reign of terror and repudiated his “cult of personality.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>DE-STALINIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Khrushchev’s program of de-Stalinization involved all of the following:</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Shifting some resources toward producing more consumer goods.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Curbing the power of the secret police.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Granting more freedom to writers and intellectuals.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>De-Stalinization permitted Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to publish <em>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</em>. This short but powerful novel described the horrors of life in a Stalinist concentration camp.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_291"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Boris Pasternak’s novel <em>Doctor Zhivago</em> illustrated the limits of de-Stalinization. The novel celebrated the human spirit and challenged the principles of communism. Although it was published in the West, Soviet censors denounced Pasternak and refused to allow him to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong><em>SPUTNIK</em></strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1957, a beaming Khrushchev proudly announced that the Soviet Union had successfully launched a 184-pound satellite named <em>Sputnik</em> into orbit around the Earth.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span><em>Sputnik</em> quickly became a symbol of Soviet technological prowess. <em>Sputnik</em>’s success played a key role in contributing to the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>COLD WAR CONFRONTATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Berlin Wall</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Between 1949 and 1961, more than 3 million East Germans fled to West Germany by crossing into West Berlin.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>On August 13, 1961, the East Germans, with Khrushchev’s support, began construction of a concrete wall along the border between East and West Berlin.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Berlin Wall stopped the flow of refugees while at the same time becoming a symbol of Communist oppression.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Khrushchev precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis by constructing nuclear missiles in Cuba.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>After a tense confrontation with the United States, Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to attack Fidel Castro.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The Cuban Missile Crisis undermined Khrushchev’s credibility and played a key role in his ouster from power in 1964.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>EASTERN EUROPE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>De-Stalinization raised hopes for more freedom in Eastern Europe.

<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The protests in Hungary quickly escalated into a major crisis when Hungary’s liberal Communist leader, Imre Nagy, promised free elections and called for the removal of Soviet troops.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Khrushchev responded by ordering the Red Army to invade Hungary. After intense fighting, the Soviets crushed the rebellion and later executed Nagy.</p>

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Conservative leaders believed that Khrushchev’s program of de-Stalinization posed a threat to the Communist Party’s dictatorial powers and special privileges.

<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Now led by Leonid Brezhnev, the Communist Party clamped down on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov, and other outspoken dissidents.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>GORBACHEV’S REFORMS</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In March 1985, members of the Politburo, the Communist Party’s top decision-making group, selected Mikhail Gorbachev as the new leader of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>When Gorbachev took power, the Soviet Union was still the world’s most feared totalitarian dictatorship. But Gorbachev recognized that “something was wrong.” Blaming poor living conditions on the country’s rigid political system and stagnant economy, he launched an unprecedented program of reforms.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span><em>Glasnost</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Soviet leaders from Vladimir Lenin to Brezhnev created a totalitarian state that controlled the mass media and restricted human rights.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In 1986, Gorbachev introduced a new policy known as <em>glasnost</em>, or openness, which encouraged Soviet citizens to discuss ways to reform their society. Soviet citizens now began to learn the truth about poor harvests, inefficient state monopolies, and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span><em>Perestroika</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span><em>Glasnost</em> gave Soviet citizens an opportunity to complain publicly about their economic problems.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In 1986, Gorbachev launched a program called <em>perestroika</em>, or economic restructuring, to revitalize the Soviet economy by removing bureaucratic control over businesses and providing incentives for greater productivity.</p>
<p class="C515">5<span class="C504">.</span><em>Demokratizatsiya</em></p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Gorbachev understood that in order for the economy to thrive, the Communist Party would have to loosen its grip on Soviet society.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>In 1989, Gorbachev unveiled a third new policy called <em>demokratizatsiya</em>, or democratization. The plan called for the election of a new legislature, the 2,250-member Congress of People’s Deputies.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_295"/>B.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: STALIN AND GORBACHEV</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Stalin</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Rejected the relatively free markets created by Lenin’s New Economic Policy.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Implemented a series of Five-Year Plans that promoted state planning and industrialization.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Forced peasant farmers to work on huge state-run and state-owned farms called collectives.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Purged party leaders who showed the slightest degree of dissent from his policies.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>Imprisoned and executed millions of Soviet citizens.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">vi.</span>Created a rigid totalitarian state.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C539">vii.</span>Imposed Soviet control over Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Gorbachev</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Advocated private ownership of property and free markets.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Allowed public discussion and criticism of Communist Party policies.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>Permitted openly contested elections.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>Allowed national minorities within the Soviet Union to express pent-up grievances.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>Encouraged East Europeans to reform their political systems without fear of Soviet armed intervention.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">vi.</span>Raised expectations in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for greater freedom.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>POLAND AND SOLIDARITY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The people of Poland were the first to test Gorbachev’s new policies.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Lech Walesa, Polish workers formed a democratic trade union called Solidarity.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Pope John Paul II provided crucial support for the Solidarity labor movement in Poland.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_296"/>4<span class="C504">.</span>In 1989, Polish voters overwhelmingly rejected the Communist Party and elected Solidarity candidates. This marked the first time the people of a nation peacefully turned a Communist regime out of power.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Inspired by the events in Poland, the people of East Germany demanded change in their government.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>On November 9, 1989, a new East German leader opened the Berlin Wall. The reunification of Germany occurred less than one year later. These watershed events marked the end of the Cold War in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>CZECHOSLOVAKIA’S VELVET REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The fall of the Berlin Wall inspired reformers in Czechoslovakia to break away from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>A general strike led by Václav Havel resulted in the collapse of the Communist government.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>However, ethnic differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks prevented the creation of a stable unified state. In 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia peacefully split into two different countries.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Gorbachev’s reforms released forces he proved unable to control. The collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe inspired ethnic groups within the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Gorbachev’s policy of <em>glasnost</em> loosened controls, enabling ethnic protests to spread across the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In a last desperate effort to preserve the Soviet Union, Communist hard-liners attempted to overthrow Gorbachev with a military coup.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The hard-liners assumed that a show of force would ensure obedience. They were wrong. Under Gorbachev’s reforms, people had lost their fear of the party and were willing to defend their freedom.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_297"/>5<span class="C504">.</span>Led by Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Republic, the Russian people thwarted the coup.</p>
<p class="C515">6<span class="C504">.</span>On December 25, 1991, Gorbachev announced his resignation as president of a country that by then had ceased to exist. The Soviet Union then dissolved into 15 separate republics. One former communist leader observed sadly, “Gorbachev tried to reform the unreformable.”</p>
