<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>NEW OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon was born in 1769 in an obscure town in Corsica, a French island off the Italian coast. He won a scholarship to study at a French military school where he distinguished himself as an eager student of military history.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon originally found his advancement blocked because he lacked noble birth. However, the French Revolution removed these barriers and provided opportunities for an ambitious and talented young officer.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CONQUERING HERO</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon steadily rose through the ranks of the republican army. By seizing opportunities presented by the Revolution, he became a general at the age of 24.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1796, Napoleon received command of the French forces in northern Italy. His combination of decisive actions and tactical genius enabled the French to win a series of stunning victories. Napoleon triumphantly returned to France as a conquering hero.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>COUP D’ÉTAT, 1799</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Ambitious politicians inside the Directory hoped to use Napoleon’s popularity and his loyal troops to overthrow the government.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The plotters staged a successful coup d’état on November 9, 1799. The new government vested executive power in the hands of three consuls. As First Consul, Napoleon exercised undisputed authority.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_164"/>D.</strong></span><strong>NAPOLEON IN CONTROL</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Although the Consulate maintained a republican façade, Napoleon controlled the new government’s entire executive powers.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In 1802, Napoleon ordered a plebiscite, or popular vote to approve his position as Consul for Life. France’s male electorate gave Napoleon 99.9 percent of their votes. Two years later, voters once again registered their near unanimous approval when Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>The Revolutionary era began with an attempt to limit the power of an arbitrary royal government. Napoleon successfully used the democratic process to undermine democracy. As Emperor, he wielded unchecked power over France’s domestic and foreign policies.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE CONCORDAT OF 1801</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon understood the importance of ending the strained relationship between the French government and the Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The Concordat of 1801 granted the Catholic Church special status as the religion of “the majority of Frenchmen.” The pope regained the right to confirm church dignitaries appointed by the French government, depose French bishops, and reopen religious seminaries. Napoleon also agreed to abandon the confusing ten-day revolutionary calendar and reestablish Sundays and religious holidays.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In return, the pope recognized the French government and accepted the loss of church properties confiscated during the Revolution.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>The Concordat of 1801 enabled Napoleon to regain the loyalty of French Catholics. Although the government recognized Catholicism as the “preferred” religion of France, the agreement protected freedom of worship for other faiths.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE NAPOLEONIC CODE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon’s legal experts replaced centuries of confusing and outdated feudal laws with a uniform legal code that is still the basis of French law.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_165"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>The new code guaranteed many achievements of the French Revolution, including equality before the law, freedom of religion, the abolition of privilege, and the protection of property rights.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Revolutionary legislation had emancipated women and children by establishing their civil liberties. Napoleon undid most of this progress by restoring the father’s absolute authority in the family. Women and children were once again legally dependent on their husband or father. For example, women could not buy or sell property or begin a business without the consent of their husbands. Any income she earned would pass to his descendants, not hers.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>A CENTRALIZED BUREAUCRACY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The National Assembly replaced France’s traditional provinces with 83 departments. Self-governing assemblies enjoyed local autonomy. Napoleon kept the departments but appointed prefects who directly supervised local affairs.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon charted a privately owned national bank to provide a depository for government funds and a source of credit for French businessmen.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon created elite secondary schools or lycées. National curriculum standards became the hallmark of a rigidly centralized academic system.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>LIBERTY OR DESPOTISM?</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon claimed that he preserved the gains of the French Revolution. His supporters argued that he fulfilled the philosophes’ dream of an enlightened despot by preserving the principle of equality before the law, guaranteeing religious toleration, and opening careers to all men of talent.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>His critics pointed out that these gains came with a steep price. The more power Napoleon accumulated, the more he wanted. Napoleon severely limited political expression. He enacted laws designed to censor plays, books, and newspapers. For example, before the coup, Paris had 73 newspapers. By 1811, the city just had four newspapers, all following the official government line.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>“EUROPE WAS AT MY FEET”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon’s insatiable ambition and the continuing enmity of England made war inevitable.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Great Britain persuaded Austria, Prussia, and Russia that they must act together to restore the balance of power and resist the spread of French influence.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Between 1805 and 1807, Napoleon defeated Austrian, Prussian, and Russian forces in a series of brilliant military victories. Napoleon accurately boasted, “Europe was at my feet.” Only Great Britain stood between Napoleon and his dream of achieving French hegemony over all of Europe.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon hoped to invade England. However, at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805, Admiral Horatio Nelson attacked and defeated a French fleet off the southern coast of Spain. The victory thwarted goals of controlling the seas and mounting an invasion of England.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE REORGANIZATION OF GERMANY</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon’s victories enabled him to dissolve the Holy Roman Empire. He consolidated previously independent German states into a French-dominated Confederation of the Rhine.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Posing as a champion of the Revolution, Napoleon abolished feudalism and granted peasants freedom from manorial duties.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>It is important to note that Napoleon unwittingly sparked a wave of German nationalism that fueled resistance to his rule. People who at first welcomed the French as liberators now felt they were being exploited by foreign invaders. Napoleon thus inadvertently accelerated the cause of German unification.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE CONTINENTAL SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon turned to economic warfare to weaken the English economy. In 1806, he ordered the beginning of a Continental System by imposing heavy penalties on anyone trading with England. Napoleon imposed a heavy strain on continental economies by forbidding the importation of English goods.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_167"/>2<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon hoped that the Continental System would damage Great Britain by disrupting its export-driven economy and causing labor unrest. But these goals did not materialize. Great Britain responded by dramatically increasing its trade with Latin America. At the same time, smugglers successfully evaded Napoleon’s agents by importing finished goods and New World sugar and tobacco.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>NATIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Nationalism enabled French governments to raise highly motivated mass armies.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>As Napoleon spread the principles of the French Revolution across the continent, he inadvertently aroused nationalist feelings across Europe. Nationalism in Germany and Spain became closely linked with opposition to French domination.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon underestimated the growing power of nationalism to inspire opposition to French rule. One contemporary critic understood this vulnerability when she observed: “He never reckoned with the one power that no arms could overcome—the enthusiasm of a whole people.”</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE BEGINNING OF SPANISH RESISTANCE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>In 1808, Napoleon awakened Spanish nationalism by replacing the country’s ruling dynasty with his brother Joseph Bonaparte.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Faced with the arbitrary removal of their royal family, the Spanish people rose in rebellion. Angry crowds rioted against French troops stationed in Madrid. The French responded by executing hundreds of rebels and innocent bystanders. The riots and executions marked the beginning of a bloody conflict known as the Peninsular War.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Francisco de Goya depicted the atrocities in Madrid in his epic painting <em>The Third of May 1808</em>. Goya’s memorable image dramatically juxtaposed an anonymous French firing squad with the haunting faces of their victims.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_168"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE “SPANISH ULCER”</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon’s highly trained army outnumbered the Spanish and their British allies. However, bands of highly mobile Spanish guerrilla fighters ambushed the French and then disappeared into the countryside. Both sides committed atrocities that contributed to a prolonged and bitter conflict.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The guerrillas and a British expeditionary force pinned down a French army of about 300,000 men. Faced with mounting losses, Napoleon referred to the conflict as his “Spanish ulcer.” The Peninsular War damaged the aura of French invincibility and inspired other nationalists to view the Spanish as unwanted invaders rather than as liberators.</p>

<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MAKING COMPARISONS: NAPOLEON AND TSAR ALEXANDER I</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon believed he could replace Europe’s crumbling state system with a supernational empire ruled from Paris. He further believed that the era of balance of power politics was over and that nationalist strivings would not stand in his way.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>In contrast, Tsar Alexander I persuaded traditional Russian foreign policy objectives. He wanted to retain a Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe and in the Baltic region. Alexander opposed Napoleon’s Continental System and reopened Russia’s ports to British and neutral vessels.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon concluded that he could no longer tolerate Alexander’s interference with his imperial goals. He mobilized a Grand Army of 600,000 men to invade Russia. The campaign began on June 23, 1812.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE RUSSIAN DEBACLE</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>The Russian campaign proved to be a debacle. Instead of directly attacking the Grand Army, the Russian generals retreated toward Moscow. As they withdrew, the Russians carried out a scorched-earth policy of burning homes, destroying crops, and slaughtering livestock.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon reached Moscow on September 14, 1812. The next day, fires probably set by Russian troops, destroyed almost three-fourths of the city.</p>
<p class="C515"><span id="page_169"/>3<span class="C504">.</span>Alexander refused to surrender forcing the frustrated Napoleon to order a belated retreat. The retreat soon became a rout. A combination of bitterly cold weather, disease, and merciless Russian attacks decimated the once Grand Army. Less than 100,000 of Napoleon’s troops survived the ordeal.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>NAPOLEON’S FINAL BATTLES</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon’s enemies quickly took advantage of his weakness. Great Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria formed a Grand Alliance that defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Nations in October 1813.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>The allied armies entered Paris in March 1814. Napoleon abdicated his throne and was exiled to Elba, a tiny island 9 miles off the Tuscan coast.</p>
<p class="C515">3<span class="C504">.</span>In March 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and formed a new army. Led by Great Britain and Prussia, the Grand Alliance defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815.</p>
<p class="C515">4<span class="C504">.</span>Napoleon abdicated a second time and was shipped to St. Helena, a remote island in the South Atlantic. Once the master of Europe, Napoleon now lived in lonely exile writing his memoirs. He died in 1821.</p>
