<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>His famous equation <em>E</em> = <em>mc</em><sup>2</sup> (energy = mass <strong>×</strong> the square of the speed of light) declared that mass and energy are interchangeable. This discovery laid the foundation for the development of nuclear power.</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Instead of living in a rational world with few uncertainties, humans lived in a new universe with few certainties. Everything was “relative” or dependent on the observer’s frame of reference.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>It is important to note that Einstein’s theories did not immediately affect the average person’s outlook on life.

<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Romantic artists and authors had explored the inner worlds of emotion and imagination.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Professional psychologists assumed that human behavior was based upon rational decisions by the conscious mind.</p>
<p class="C499"><span class="C467"><strong><span id="page_260"/>B.</strong></span><strong>SIGMUND FREUD (1856–1939)</strong></p>
<p class="C515">1<span class="C504">.</span>Theories</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Freud believed that the human psyche includes three distinct parts, which he called the id, the superego, and the ego.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The id consists of inborn sexual and aggressive urges.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iii.</span>The superego acts as the conscience that seeks to repress the id. It develops as children learn their culture’s moral values.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C520">iv.</span>When the superego checks the pleasure-seeking impulses of the id, it drives them into the realm of the subconscious mind. The subconscious is irrational and recognizes no ethical restrictions.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">v.</span>The ego is the center of reason. It attempts to find a balance between the conflicting demands of the id and the superego.</p>
<p class="C515">2<span class="C504">.</span>Implications</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>Freud’s theories undermined the Enlightenment’s belief that humans are fundamentally rational beings. Instead, humans are irrational beings capable of destroying themselves and society.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>Freud’s emphasis upon the power of uncontrolled irrational and unconscious drives provided an unsettling explanation for the seemingly incomprehensible horrors unleashed by World War I.</p>

<p class="C533"><span class="C525">i.</span>The Weimar Republic supported itself by printing vast amounts of paper money. By December 1923, one dollar was worth 4 trillion German marks.</p>
<p class="C533"><span class="C521">ii.</span>The 1923 inflation destroyed the savings and incomes of the German middle class. Feeling betrayed by their government, embittered Germans would later be susceptible to Nazi propaganda.</p>
