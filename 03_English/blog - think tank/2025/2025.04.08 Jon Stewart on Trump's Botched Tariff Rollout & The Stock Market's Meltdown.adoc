== 释义

Welcome to The Daily Show 每日秀.
My name is Jon Stewart 乔恩·斯图尔特.
Great show 精彩的表演 for you tonight.
Rahm Emanuel 拉姆·伊曼纽尔(美国驻日本大使) will be joining me later to remind me—
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE 欢呼掌声]
He'll be out here 他会出现在这里, *reminding me* just _which one of the three brothers he is_ *again*.
I don't know. Is he the one that owns (v.) UFC 终极格斗锦标赛?
*Does it matter* at this point?

But that is later 但那是以后的事了.
First, as you know, our economy—
[LAUGHTER 笑声]
Our economy is in the midst of a beautiful metamorphosis 华丽蜕变, turning from a simple caterpillar 毛毛虫 into a dead caterpillar 毛虫,蠋（蝴蝶或蛾的幼虫）.
[LAUGHTER]
So let's get into it with another exciting installment of "Trade Wars 贸易战."
[MUSIC PLAYING]

My favorite word. My favorite word—"tariff 关税." No! Tariffs!

Now, you might remember when Donald Trump was reelected 连任, Wall Street 华尔街 was thrilled—excited about deregulation 放松管制, tax cuts 减税, and the fact that you could once again call people "sugar tits 甜心宝贝."

​​REPORTER:​​ One top banker 顶级银行家 told the paper that he feels liberated 获得解放 because now he can use offensive slurs 冒犯性词汇 like the R-word and the P-word without fear of getting canceled 被取消文化 at work.

Mmm. The R-word and the P-word? Well, I can tell you today that that top banker is definitely using both of those words.
[LAUGHTER]
Perhaps even adding "mother​​fucker​​." Right now.

The market meltdown 市场崩盘. For the third straight day, global markets 全球市场 are sinking. Markets across Asia, Europe, and Australia plunging 暴跌.

​​REPORTER:​​ At one point this morning, the Dow 道琼斯指数 sinking almost 1,600 points.

​​REPORTER:​​ The markets lost more than $6.5 trillion in value 市值蒸发.

This is an economic Armageddon 经济末日.
[LAUGHTER]
Who wears a Hawaiian shirt 夏威夷衬衫 to an economic Armageddon? What are we doing here? Did they pull you in from the pool? The financial channel's Rodney Dangerfield 金融界的罗德尼·丹杰菲尔德 or something?

I told my wife about the stock plunge 股市暴跌. She said, "Oh, I thought you guys would never go down there."
[MUMBLES 嘀咕]
[SCATTERED LAUGHTER 零星笑声]
Haven't done that one in a while.

This turmoil 动荡 could have lasting effects on the global economy 全球经济, on everyday Americans, and, most worryingly, the stock portfolios 股票投资组合 of members of Congress 国会议员.

Mr. President, now is the time to soothe a worried nation 安抚国民. Donald Trump put this out on social media:

"Don't be weak. Don't be stupid. Don't be a Panican," which he has termed a new party based on weak and stupid people.
[LAUGHTER]

Panican? The genius who gave us classics like "Sleepy Joe 瞌睡乔" and "Crooked Hillary 骗子希拉里" just ​​shit​​ out "you're a Panican"? How about Hysterocrats 歇斯底里党? Repussicans 共和怂包? How about Cryontologists 哭哭学派?
[LAUGHTER]

Did the overseas factory you had been sourcing your nicknames from get shut down during the tariff war 关税战?

So we're going to try this again, Mr. President. Can you ease the fears of this nation like a true leader?

​​REPORTER:​​ President Trump holding firm 坚持立场, posting on Truth Social 真相社交: "Only the weak will fail 只有弱者会失败."
[LAUGHTER]

What are you doing? Your economic policy has the same tagline 标语 as season 3 of Squid Game 鱿鱼游戏? That's supposed to make us feel better? "Only the weak shall die in my economy."

By the way, in case you didn't get the point that he doesn't give a ​​fuck​​, he spent the weekend showing, not telling. He played not a round of golf 高尔夫球局 this weekend—a tournament of golf, a three-day tournament—812 holes of golf with his LIV Golf Saudi benefactors 沙特金主.

And in case you're wondering about the venerated journalists 资深记者 who are now allowed to be in the press pool 记者团, this was literally the first question he was asked on Air Force One 空军一号 in the middle of a financial meltdown:

​​REPORTER:​​ Mr. President, how did you play this weekend?

[CHUCKLING 轻笑]
[GROANING 嘘声]
[BOOING 喝倒彩]

​​TRUMP:​​ Because I won! You heard I won! You heard I won! I won! You heard I won! I won! Mom, Mom! I won!
[LAUGHTER]
Mom! I won the tournament, Mom! I'm a good boy! Good boy, good golf.
[LAUGHTER]

I know the stock market is not the totality of the economy 经济全部. But if I remember correctly, in the run-up to the election 选举前夕, Trump seemed very concerned about the stock market.

​​TRUMP CLIP:​​ If Harris wins this election, the result will be a Kamala economic crash 哈里斯经济崩溃, a 1929-style Depression 大萧条.

And anything she can do, I can do better!
[LAUGHTER]
I can do it on my own! I won, Mom! Hey, Mom! Look! Hey, Mom! Look! No economy!
[LAUGHTER]
Please love me!

And it didn't have to happen like this. Trump had so many options to shape the world economy 塑造世界经济 into the one he thought was fairer. He could have proposed some incentives 激励措施 to bring back manufacturing 制造业回流. He could have gone sector to sector, nation to nation, negotiate better trade reciprocal agreements 互惠贸易协定.

But he had to go full Teresa.
[MIMICS SCREAMING 模仿尖叫]
"You ​​fucking​​ stupid bitch 蠢货!"
[BLEEP 哔声]
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

Now, to be fair—to be fair—
To be fair to the Trump administration, they did give it almost two months and no effort before they asked ChatGPT 聊天机器人 what it thought they should do.

But for those of us who've been tricked into believing that an economic crisis is a crisis, Trump's people have an answer:

"Don't panic. Calm down. Everything is going to be OK."
"I would not worry at all. The Dow is actually in the same place it was in August."
"Do me a favor. Don't look at your stock portfolio 股票组合."
"You know what? I don't really care about my 401(k) 退休金计划."
[LAUGHTER]
"Live, laugh, love 活在当下, that's what I always say."

You know what I say to all of you? It's 401(k) somewhere.
[IMITATES CHUGGING 模仿灌酒声]

And when did the right become so chill 淡定? Aren't you the "Bud Light's turning my kids trans 百威啤酒让孩子变性" folks? But economic meltdown 经济崩溃 and you're getting all philosophical 哲学思考?

​​CLIP:​​ "Losing money costs you nothing 亏钱不花钱. This is just the reality of life."
"Like, when you're young and dumb 年少无知, how much money did you lose?"
"Everyone loses money. Everyone loses money. It costs you nothing."
[LAUGHTER]

Except money.
[LAUGHTER]
Losing money costs you money. It's the definition of losing money.

And I know you go, "Well, it's going to be worth it to get the character of the country 国家品格 that we want back again." But we have no ​​fucking​​ idea if that's actually what's going to happen.

You're all acting like the tariff regime 关税制度 is a tried-and-true remedy 万灵药. "Oh, of course, this is the medicine that's always prescribed." Except the last time it was tried 100 years ago, we had a Great Depression 大萧条.

So how does this work? It's just a big game of economic Operation 经济版手术游戏. He's sticking things in, trying to take out tariffs.

It's like, when you're my age, you got to get a colonoscopy 结肠镜检查. You need a full colonic 灌肠, like, to feel better. You know what I mean?

​​CLIP:​​ "Rat poison 老鼠药 can kill somebody in the wrong dosages 错误剂量, but in the right dosages, that can be very healthy for the patient."
[LAUGHTER]

So everyone relax. This is merely a routine rat poison colonoscopy 老鼠药灌肠.
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

By the way, what's the right dosage of rat poison?
[LAUGHTER]
Oh, if you get enough of it, your headache will be gone.

And by the way, I mean, slightly off topic 跑题, but the colonoscopy guy? His name is John Tobacco 约翰·烟草.
[LAUGHTER]
It's a Witness Protection 证人保护计划 thing, isn't it?
[LAUGHTER]

So here's how it's going to go:
"Your new name is John Tobacco. Say it back to me."
"John Tobacco."
"Your name is John Tobacco. Say it back to me."
"John Tobacco."
"Your new profession is you do anus metaphors 肛门隐喻 on Newsmax 极右翼媒体. Your name is John Tobacco. You do anus metaphors. Say it back to me."
"Say it back to me!"

By the way, if Trump wants us to stay the course 坚持到底 with his radical plan 激进计划, you might want to think of a strategy that inspires our confidence that you all know what you're doing.

Like, for instance, these tariffs—is this a negotiation 谈判?

​​CLIP:​​ "The president made it clear yesterday—this is not a negotiation."
"Let me make this very clear. This is not a negotiation. This is not that. This is a national emergency 国家紧急状态."

OK. It's a national emergency. It's not a negotiation.

​​STEWART:​​ Well, I don't agree, but at least I have some clarity now.
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
Too much rat poison.

So is this a negotiation, or is this permanent 永久性的?
[LAUGHTER]
How much White Lotus 白莲花度假村 did you people watch?
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
What is permanence in this negotiated life we live? Have a piña colada 椰林飘香. Forget about if they're permanent or not permanent.

What are we doing? How will this bring jobs back? What are these jobs?

​​COMMERCE SECRETARY LUTNICK:​​ "Trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America."
"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws 拧螺丝 to make iPhones—that kind of thing is going to come to America."
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

[MUMBLES] This is also that millions of Americans can develop the—I can't even get the lint 棉絮 out of the charging area on my phone. Now I got to do little screw in the thing? Those are the jobs?

"That kind of thing is going to come to America."
"It's going to be automated 自动化."
"And great Americans—the tradecraft of America is going to fix them."
"Mechanics fixing robotics 修理机器人—that's what's coming to America."
[LAUGHTER]

So it's not the screws. We're going to be robot mechanics 机器人修理工. The robots do the screwing, and we're just there to make sure the robots are lubed 润滑 and ready to screw. That is the American Renaissance 美国复兴.

We are robot fluffers 机器人打杂工.
We are waiting—this is all—
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

So if I'm an American manufacturer, how long do these onerous tariffs 繁重关税 have to stay in place to convince me to build my army of automated screw-and-robot mechanics?

​​CLIP:​​ "They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks."
[LAUGHTER]

Jon Stewart for Popular Robot Mechanics 大众机器人修理工杂志.

I've never built a fully automated robot factory before. But is days and weeks enough time or too much time? Feels like it would take a month.

Well, I guess that's silver lining 一线希望 number one of this trade war. Want something even more underwhelming 更扫兴的? Here's the Treasury Secretary 财政部长 on if we've heard the good news on the stock collapse:

​​TREASURY SECRETARY:​​ "One thing that I can tell you as the Treasury Secretary, what I've been very impressed with is the market infrastructure 市场基础设施, that we had record volume 创纪录交易量 on Friday."
"And everything is working very smoothly."
"So the American people—they'd be very—take great comfort in that."
[LAUGHTER]

Blink twice 眨两次眼 if you want to be saved.
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

I was very—I was very impressed that in the market crash, the building is still standing.
[LAUGHTER]

The captain of the—I was very impressed by the way that the Titanic just slid into the water, just smooth, almost like it was taking a bath. Just dipping a toe.

Those drownings should take great comfort in the lack of back splash 没有水花.
[LAUGHTER]

But their best argument so far for any of this is the same one that we got about Tinker Bell 小叮当 being able to fly. You have to believe.

"Don't panic."
"OK, you've got a president who understands business."
"I am grateful for a commander-in-chief that has the business acumen 商业头脑."
"Luckily, we have a businessman in the White House right now."
"The president did write the book The Art of the Deal 交易的艺术."
"Trump is a master negotiator 谈判大师, and he does know the art of the deal."

We're supposed to trust this guy because he wrote The Art of the Deal? That's it. You ever say—I got the book! I got the book, The Art of the Deal.

Yeah? That's why we're supposed to trust him? Did you ever look at chapter 9 in Art of the Deal? It's about how smart Trump is about his casino in Atlantic City 大西洋城赌场.

Oh! Oh! Yeah! Chapter 9: "I built the casino in Atlantic City! I'm a business genius."

What ever happened to the casino, Donald?
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
[CHEERING]

Trust me!
[LAUGHTER]
[PURRS 呼噜声]

Look, you make a big announcement, but your reciprocal tariff formula 互惠关税公式 was just the trade deficit divided by imports equation 贸易逆差除以进口额. And when you got busted on that, you threw out this ridiculous ​​bullshit​​ calculus problem 微积分题目 that's just shapes that boils down to the trade deficit divided by imports, which is the formula that got the rich country of Lesotho 莱索托 hit with 50% tariffs.

Lesotho. Oh, your free ride's over, you denim-making fat cats 牛仔裤暴发户.
[LAUGHTER]

But we continue to blame everybody else in the world that we designed and policed after World War II. We're the richest country in the world ever. We're not the world's victims.

If we have inequalities in this country, that's on us. It's not a supply problem. It's not unfair trade for the most part. It's an investment and distribution problem 投资分配问题. It's our ​​fucking​​ fault.

And I'm not saying we can't make adjustments and renegotiate things, but it didn't have to be this reckless 鲁莽.

You killed the hostage 人质 and then went, "So, ransom 赎金?"
[LAUGHTER]

Some of the biggest stock market declines since the Great Depression.

​​REPORTER:​​ The worst three consecutive sessions 连续三个交易日 since 1987.
"Even worse than it was during the 2008 financial crisis."
​​REPORTER:​​ Their worst day since June 2020 during the COVID pandemic.

Financial destruction not seen since the pandemic. And this time, there's no controversy over how it all started. There's no wet market 海鲜市场.

You, Trump, released the contagion 释放病毒. It's your lab leak 实验室泄漏, and it's right out in the open.

This is like if the researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology 武汉病毒研究所 walked out to the great lawn with a Tupperware 特百惠 and went, "We have an exciting announcement!"
[LAUGHTER]

欢迎收看《每日秀》，我是乔恩·斯图尔特。稍后拉姆·伊曼纽尔将登场帮我回忆——
[欢呼掌声]
他得提醒我, 他到底是三兄弟里的哪一个。是拥有UFC的那个吗？现在还重要吗？

先说说我们正在经历"华丽蜕变"的经济——
[笑声]
从毛毛虫变成了死毛毛虫。
[笑声]
现在进入精彩的"贸易战"环节。
[背景音乐]

我最爱的词——"关税"！

**记得特朗普连任时, 华尔街多兴奋吗？他们为放松管制、减税欢呼，**终于又能叫人"甜心宝贝"了。
记者："某顶级银行家表示, 终于能说R词和P词了，不怕被职场封杀"
呵呵，那位银行家现在肯定正把这两个词和"狗娘养的"连起来用。

全球市场连续第三天暴跌，亚欧美澳全线跳水。
记者："今晨道指狂泻1600点"
记者："市值蒸发6.5万亿美元"
这是经济末日啊！
[笑声]
谁穿着夏威夷衬衫报道经济末日？刚从泳池捞来的吗？金融界的罗德尼·丹杰菲尔德？

我太太听说股市暴跌时说："哦？我以为你们永远不会'下行'呢"
[嘀咕]
[零星笑声]
这个梗好久没用了。

这场动荡, 将影响全球经济、普通民众，最糟的是国会议员的股票组合。

总统先生，现在该安抚国民了。特朗普在社交平台发文：
"别软弱，别愚蠢，别当'恐慌党'"
[笑声]
"恐慌党"？发明"瞌睡乔", "骗子希拉里"的天才，现在憋出个"恐慌党"？不如叫"歇斯底里党", "共和怂包", "哭哭学派"？
[笑声]
难道你取绰号的海外工厂, 被关税战搞倒闭了？

记者："特朗普在"真相社交"坚持立场：'只有弱者会失败'"
[笑声]
你经济政策的口号, 怎么和《鱿鱼游戏》第三季一样？"在我的经济里, 只有弱者会死"？

他周末, 用实际行动表明不在乎——不是打高尔夫，是打了三天锦标赛，和沙特金主打了812洞。

记者团在空军一号上的首个提问：
"总统先生，您周末打得如何？"
[轻笑][嘘声]
特朗普："因为我赢了！妈妈我赢了！我是好孩子！"
[笑声]

我知道股市不代表经济全部。但选举前特朗普可是很关心股市的：
"哈里斯当选, 会导致经济大萧条"
结果现在："妈妈看！我能搞垮经济！"
[笑声]

他本可以采取激励措施, 让制造业回流，协商互惠贸易协定...
却选择了泰瑞莎式咆哮：
"你这蠢货！"
[哔声]
[笑声掌声]

说句公道话，特朗普政府确实"努力"了——两个月没作为后, 去问了ChatGPT。

但对把"经济危机"当回事的人，他们建议：
"别看股票组合", "谁在乎401(k)退休金", "及时行乐".
要我说：不如喝个烂醉。
[模仿灌酒声]

*右派什么时候这么淡定了？你们不是坚信"百威啤酒让孩子变性"吗？经济崩溃时反倒开始哲学思考了？*

新闻片段："亏钱不花钱，这就是人生", "谁年轻时没亏过钱", "反正人人都在亏"
[笑声]
——除了钱本身。亏钱就是亏钱啊！

你们说"为了重塑国家品格值得"，但谁知道真能实现？
把关税制度当万灵药？上次尝试是一百年前，结果是大萧条。

这就像经济版"手术游戏"，他不停往里插关税。
到了我这年纪得做"结肠镜"检查，需要彻底灌肠才舒服——懂我意思吧？

新闻片段："老鼠药剂量错了能杀人，对了却能治病"
[笑声]
所以放轻松，这只是常规的老鼠药灌肠疗法。
[笑声掌声]
顺便问：老鼠药正确剂量是多少？
[笑声]
——足够剂量连头痛都能治。

跑题说下，那个灌肠专家叫"约翰·烟草"？
[笑声]
是"证人保护计划"给改的名吧？
流程肯定是："你的新名字是约翰·烟草，重复一遍", "你要在极右翼媒体讲肛门隐喻，重复一遍"

如果特朗普想让我们坚持他的激进计划，至少该拿出点靠谱策略。

比如这些关税——是谈判吗？
新闻片段："总统明确表示这不是谈判，是国家紧急状态".
好吧，至少现在明确了。
[笑声掌声]
（老鼠药喝多了）

所以这是永久性, 还是临时性？
[笑声]
你们《白莲花度假村》看多了吧？
[笑声掌声]
在这谈判人生里谈什么永久？不如喝杯椰林飘香。

商务部长说："数万亿美元工厂将建在美国", "数百万美国人会为iPhone拧螺丝"
[笑声掌声]
——我连手机充电口的灰都清不干净，现在让我拧螺丝？

"这些工作将自动化", "美国工匠会修理机器人"
[笑声]
所以我们不是拧螺丝，是当机器人修理工？机器人负责拧，我们负责给机器人润滑？这就是美国复兴？
我们是机器人打杂工！
[欢呼掌声]

*财政部长谈股市崩盘的好消息："市场基础设施完好，周五交易量破纪录"*
[笑声]
想求救就眨两次眼。
[笑声掌声]
*泰坦尼克号沉得那么丝滑，淹死的人该欣慰没溅起水花。*

*他们最好的论据, 和"小叮当会飞"的设定一样——要你相信：
"别慌", "总统懂商业", "他写过《交易的艺术》"*
就凭这个相信他？看过第九章吗？吹他建大西洋城赌场多聪明——那赌场后来咋样了？
[笑声掌声]

**你们的"互惠关税公式", 就是"贸易逆差"除以"进口额"，**被拆穿后抛出更扯的微积分题。莱索托这种穷国, 因此被征50%关税。

*我们二战后设计并监管世界体系，现在却怪所有人。国内不平等是"投资分配"问题，是我们自己的锅。*

没必要这么鲁莽——像杀了人质再问"赎金多少？"
[笑声]

这次股灾堪比大萧条时期，但不同于疫情，这次病毒源很明确：
就像武汉病毒所研究员端着特百惠盒子宣布："我们要搞个大新闻！"
[笑声]

Welcome to The Daily Show.
My name is Jon Stewart.
Great show for you tonight.
Rahm Emanuel will be joining me later to remind me—
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]
He'll be out here, reminding me just which one of the three brothers he is again.
I don't know. Is he the one that owns UFC?
Does it matter at this point?

But that is later.

​​REPORTER:​​ At one point this morning, the Dow sinking almost 1,600 points.

​​REPORTER:​​ The markets lost more than $6.5 trillion in value.

This is an economic Armageddon.

Who wears a Hawaiian shirt to an economic Armageddon? What are we doing here? Did they pull you in from the pool? The financial channel's Rodney Dangerfield or something?

I told my wife about the stock plunge. She said, "Oh, I thought you guys would never go down there."
[MUMBLES]
[SCATTERED LAUGHTER]
Haven't done that one in a while.

This turmoil could have lasting effects on the global economy, on everyday Americans, and, most worryingly, the stock portfolios of members of Congress.

Mr. President, now is the time to soothe a worried nation. Donald Trump put this out on social media:

"Don't be weak. Don't be stupid. Don't be a Panican," which he has termed a new party based on weak and stupid people.
[LAUGHTER]

Panican? The genius who gave us classics like "Sleepy Joe" and "Crooked Hillary" just ​​shit​​ out "you're a Panican"? How about Hysterocrats? Repussicans? How about Cryontologists?
[LAUGHTER]

Did the overseas factory you had been sourcing your nicknames from get shut down during the tariff war?

So we're going to try this again, Mr. President. Can you ease the fears of this nation like a true leader?

​​REPORTER:​​ President Trump holding firm, posting on Truth Social: "Only the weak will fail."
[LAUGHTER]

What are you doing? Your economic policy has the same tagline as season 3 of Squid Game? That's supposed to make us feel better? "Only the weak shall die in my economy."

By the way, in case you didn't get the point that he doesn't give a ​​fuck​​, he spent the weekend showing, not telling. He played not a round of golf this weekend—a tournament of golf, a three-day tournament—812 holes of golf with his LIV Golf Saudi benefactors.

[LAUGHTER]
I can do it on my own! I won, Mom! Hey, Mom! Look! Hey, Mom! Look! No economy!
[LAUGHTER]
Please love me!

And it didn't have to happen like this. Trump had so many options to shape the world economy into the one he thought was fairer. He could have proposed some incentives to bring back manufacturing. He could have gone sector to sector, nation to nation, negotiate better trade reciprocal agreements.

But he had to go full Teresa.
[MIMICS SCREAMING]
"You ​​fucking​​ stupid bitch!"
[BLEEP]
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

Now, to be fair—to be fair—
To be fair to the Trump administration, they did give it almost two months and no effort before they asked ChatGPT what it thought they should do.

But for those of us who've been tricked into believing that an economic crisis is a crisis, Trump's people have an answer:

"I would not worry at all. The Dow is actually in the same place it was in August."
"Do me a favor. Don't look at your stock portfolio."
"You know what? I don't really care about my 401(k)."
[LAUGHTER]
"Live, laugh, love, that's what I always say."

You know what I say to all of you? It's 401(k) somewhere.
[IMITATES CHUGGING]

And when did the right become so chill? Aren't you the "Bud Light's turning my kids trans" folks? But economic meltdown and you're getting all philosophical?

​​CLIP:​​ "Losing money costs you nothing. This is just the reality of life."
"Like, when you're young and dumb, how much money did you lose?"
"Everyone loses money. Everyone loses money. It costs you nothing."
[LAUGHTER]

Except money.
[LAUGHTER]
Losing money costs you money. It's the definition of losing money.

By the way, what's the right dosage of rat poison?
[LAUGHTER]
Oh, if you get enough of it, your headache will be gone.

And by the way, I mean, slightly off topic, but the colonoscopy guy? His name is John Tobacco.
[LAUGHTER]
It's a Witness Protection thing, isn't it?
[LAUGHTER]

So here's how it's going to go:
"Your new name is John Tobacco. Say it back to me."
"John Tobacco."
"Your name is John Tobacco. Say it back to me."
"John Tobacco."
"Your new profession is you do anus metaphors on Newsmax. Your name is John Tobacco. You do anus metaphors. Say it back to me."
"Say it back to me!"

By the way, if Trump wants us to stay the course with his radical plan, you might want to think of a strategy that inspires our confidence that you all know what you're doing.

Like, for instance, these tariffs—is this a negotiation?

OK. It's a national emergency. It's not a negotiation.

​​STEWART:​​ Well, I don't agree, but at least I have some clarity now.
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
Too much rat poison.

So is this a negotiation, or is this permanent?
[LAUGHTER]
How much White Lotus did you people watch?
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
What is permanence in this negotiated life we live? Have a piña colada. Forget about if they're permanent or not permanent.

What are we doing? How will this bring jobs back? What are these jobs?

​​COMMERCE SECRETARY LUTNICK:​​ "Trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America."
"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones—that kind of thing is going to come to America."
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

[MUMBLES] This is also that millions of Americans can develop the—I can't even get the lint out of the charging area on my phone. Now I got to do little screw in the thing? Those are the jobs?

"That kind of thing is going to come to America."
"It's going to be automated."
"And great Americans—the tradecraft of America is going to fix them."
"Mechanics fixing robotics—that's what's coming to America."
[LAUGHTER]

So it's not the screws. We're going to be robot mechanics. The robots do the screwing, and we're just there to make sure the robots are lubed and ready to screw. That is the American Renaissance.

We are robot fluffers.
We are waiting—this is all—
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

So if I'm an American manufacturer, how long do these onerous tariffs have to stay in place to convince me to build my army of automated screw-and-robot mechanics?

​​CLIP:​​ "They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks."
[LAUGHTER]

Jon Stewart for Popular Robot Mechanics.

I've never built a fully automated robot factory before. But is days and weeks enough time or too much time? Feels like it would take a month.

Well, I guess that's silver lining number one of this trade war. Want something even more underwhelming? Here's the Treasury Secretary on if we've heard the good news on the stock collapse:

​​TREASURY SECRETARY:​​ "One thing that I can tell you as the Treasury Secretary, what I've been very impressed with is the market infrastructure, that we had record volume on Friday."
"And everything is working very smoothly."
"So the American people—they'd be very—take great comfort in that."
[LAUGHTER]

Blink twice if you want to be saved.
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

I was very—I was very impressed that in the market crash, the building is still standing.
[LAUGHTER]

The captain of the—I was very impressed by the way that the Titanic just slid into the water, just smooth, almost like it was taking a bath. Just dipping a toe.

Those drownings should take great comfort in the lack of back splash.
[LAUGHTER]

But their best argument so far for any of this is the same one that we got about Tinker Bell being able to fly. You have to believe.

"Don't panic."
"OK, you've got a president who understands business."
"I am grateful for a commander-in-chief that has the business acumen."
"Luckily, we have a businessman in the White House right now."
"The president did write the book The Art of the Deal."
"Trump is a master negotiator, and he does know the art of the deal."

We're supposed to trust this guy because he wrote The Art of the Deal? That's it. You ever say—I got the book! I got the book, The Art of the Deal.

Yeah? That's why we're supposed to trust him? Did you ever look at chapter 9 in Art of the Deal? It's about how smart Trump is about his casino in Atlantic City.

Oh! Oh! Yeah! Chapter 9: "I built the casino in Atlantic City! I'm a business genius."

What ever happened to the casino, Donald?
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
[CHEERING]

Trust me!
[LAUGHTER]
[PURRS]

Look, you make a big announcement, but your reciprocal tariff formula was just the trade deficit divided by imports equation. And when you got busted on that, you threw out this ridiculous ​​bullshit​​ calculus problem that's just shapes that boils down to the trade deficit divided by imports, which is the formula that got the rich country of Lesotho hit with 50% tariffs.

Lesotho. Oh, your free ride's over, you denim-making fat cats.
[LAUGHTER]

But we continue to blame everybody else in the world that we designed and policed after World War II. We're the richest country in the world ever. We're not the world's victims.

If we have inequalities in this country, that's on us. It's not a supply problem. It's not unfair trade for the most part. It's an investment and distribution problem. It's our ​​fucking​​ fault.

And I'm not saying we can't make adjustments and renegotiate things, but it didn't have to be this reckless.

You killed the hostage and then went, "So, ransom?"
[LAUGHTER]

Some of the biggest stock market declines since the Great Depression.

​​REPORTER:​​ The worst three consecutive sessions since 1987.
"Even worse than it was during the 2008 financial crisis."
​​REPORTER:​​ Their worst day since June 2020 during the COVID pandemic.

Financial destruction not seen since the pandemic. And this time, there's no controversy over how it all started. There's no wet market.

You, Trump, released the contagion. It's your lab leak, and it's right out in the open.

This is like if the researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology walked out to the great lawn with a Tupperware and went, "We have an exciting announcement!"
[LAUGHTER]
