Opening Remarks and Introduction 开场致辞与介绍
James Acton:
Okay, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is James Acton. I'm co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program 核政策项目 here at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 卡内基国际和平基金会.

I just want to say welcome to you all for this afternoon's event. I'm going to hand over in just a sec to our moderator 主持人, but I just want to say, firstly, a very warm congratulations to Fiona Cunningham, who's here for the Carnegie launch 卡内基发布会 of her book, Under the Nuclear Shadow 《核阴影之下》.

Fiona, in my mind, is one of the most brilliant 卓越的 and insightful 见解深刻的 commentators 评论员 on China—on China's nuclear weapons 核武器 and its other forms of strategic weapons 战略武器. Fiona wrote at least part of this book while she was a Stanton Fellow 斯坦顿研究员 at Carnegie three or four years ago now. Was it pre-pandemic 疫情前? It was during the pandemic 疫情期间—that was right. I remember because you spent some of the time in Australia, incredibly gamely 令人敬佩地 getting up for Zooms at, like, 3:00 in the morning Australian time 澳大利亚时间, because that was daytime over here.

It’s wonderful to see this book come out. It’s an incredibly insightful 深刻的, fascinating 引人入胜的 read. So I encourage 鼓励 everyone to go and buy copies outside and then to embarrass 让……尴尬 Fiona by asking her to sign them at the end of today’s talk.

Let me also hand over, first of all, to the moderator 主持人 for today’s meeting, Pranav Vadhyar. Pranav is another ex-Carnegie person 前卡内基研究员 who went on to bigger and better things 更重要的事业 afterwards.

Specifically, before he joined Carnegie, Pranav was in the State Department 美国国务院. Recently, towards the end of the Biden administration 拜登政府, he was Senior Director 高级主管 on the National Security Council 国家安全委员会 for arms control 军备控制, disarmament 裁军, and nonproliferation 核不扩散.

The fact that the Trump administration 特朗普政府 has not named a successor 继任者 for him, in my mind, can only be because he did the job so well that there is literally nothing left to do on arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation.

Pranav is currently affiliated with 隶属于 MIT, where he is taking a well-deserved 当之无愧的 intellectual break 学术休整 after exceptionally hard work 极其辛苦的工作 on the National Security Council.

So, Pranav, let me welcome you and your co-panelists 共同讨论嘉宾 to the stage and just say thank you very much to all of you for being here today. And Pranav will introduce 介绍 everybody on the panel.

[Applause]

大家下午好，女士们先生们。我是詹姆斯·阿克顿，卡内基国际和平基金会核政策项目的联合主任。

欢迎大家来到今天下午的活动。我马上就会把话筒交给我们的主持人，但首先，我要向菲奥娜·坎宁安表示热烈的祝贺。她今天来到这里，参加她的新书《核阴影之下》的卡内基发布会。

在我看来，菲奥娜是研究中国核武器及其其他战略武器最杰出、最具洞察力的评论员之一。她的这本书，至少部分内容是在三四年前她担任卡内基斯坦顿研究员时撰写的。是疫情前吗？哦，对，是疫情期间。我记得当时你在澳大利亚，令人敬佩地凌晨三点起床参加 Zoom 会议，因为那时正是我们这边的白天。

现在看到这本书出版，真的很高兴。这是一本内容深刻、引人入胜的著作。所以，我鼓励大家去外面买一本，然后在今天演讲结束后，找菲奥娜签名，让她小小尴尬一下。

接下来，我要把话筒交给今天会议的主持人普拉纳夫·瓦迪亚尔。普拉纳夫曾在卡内基工作，后来从事了更重要的事业。

在加入卡内基之前，普拉纳夫曾在美国国务院工作。最近，在拜登政府即将结束时，他担任了国家安全委员会负责军控、裁军和核不扩散事务的高级主管。

特朗普政府至今没有为他任命继任者，在我看来，可能是因为他做得太出色，以至于军控、裁军和核不扩散方面已经没有什么事情可做了。

目前，普拉纳夫在麻省理工学院工作，正在经历一段当之无愧的学术休整，因为他在国家安全委员会工作期间付出了极大的努力。

所以，普拉纳夫，欢迎你和你的共同讨论嘉宾上台。也非常感谢大家今天的到来。接下来，普拉纳夫将介绍讨论嘉宾。

[掌声]

Moderator’s Introduction and Comments on Fiona’s Book
主持人介绍及对菲奥娜新书的评价
Pranav Vadhyar:
All right, well, thanks everyone for joining us, and thank you, James, for that kind introduction 友善的介绍.

I want to introduce our panelists 讨论嘉宾 briefly, but first, let me just share a few thoughts on Fiona’s book—why I think it’s such an important contribution 重要贡献 to our discourse 讨论 and analysis 分析.

As many people know, Washington is hotly debating 激烈讨论 what to do about China’s nuclear buildup 核武扩张. That crosses into 关系到 arms control 军备控制, nonproliferation 核不扩散, disarmament 裁军, nuclear posture 核战略姿态, and nuclear policy 核政策 conversations 讨论 taking place in the government and outside.

Some, like the Strategic Posture Commission 战略姿态委员会, note that U.S. strategy should no longer consider China to be a lesser-included threat 次要威胁 and are calling for an increase 增加 in the nuclear force 核力量 in the United States, as well as the conventional forces 常规部队.

Many officials 官员 have noted the significance 重要性 of China’s buildup 扩张 occurring right now, as the New START treaty 《新削减战略武器条约》 is due to expire 到期 next year. This creates added pressure 额外压力 for these conversations 讨论 that are taking place within the U.S. government.

The discourse 讨论 has tended to focus on the shifting strategic nuclear equation 变化中的战略核态势 between the United States and Russia, the United States and China, and all three combined. And those numerical comparisons 数字比较—trying to find the perfect number 最合适的数量—are always going to occupy 主导 the debate 争论 that’s taking place here.

中文翻译：
好的，感谢大家的到来，也感谢詹姆斯的友善介绍。

在介绍我们的讨论嘉宾之前，我想先谈一谈菲奥娜的新书，以及为什么我认为它对我们的讨论和分析是如此重要的贡献。

众所周知，华盛顿正在激烈讨论如何应对中国的核武扩张。这涉及军备控制、核不扩散、裁军、核战略姿态以及政府内外的核政策讨论。

一些组织，比如战略姿态委员会，认为美国的战略不应再把中国视为次要威胁，并呼吁美国增加核力量以及常规部队。

许多官员指出，中国当前的扩张至关重要，尤其是《新削减战略武器条约》将在明年到期。这使得美国政府内部的讨论压力倍增。

目前的讨论主要聚焦于美国与俄罗斯、美国与中国，以及三国整体之间不断变化的战略核态势。而这些数字上的比较——寻找最合适的核武器数量——始终是这里争论的焦点。


What Fiona’s book does, actually, is help us understand China’s strategic 战略的；策略的 rationale 基本原理；根本原因. Um, this isn’t just a math problem. We need to understand China’s foreign policy goals, the dilemmas 困境；进退两难 that Beijing has been responding to over the past couple of decades 十年, um, and the relevance 相关性；重要性 of nuclear deterrence 威慑, conventional 传统的；常规的 deterrence, and Information Age capabilities 能力；才能 to how they see the world and their near abroad. I think this book will be a really critical 关键的；至关重要的 contribution 贡献. It’ll help educate U.S. policymakers, academics 学者, and experts worldwide on understanding Chinese thinking on these issues today. And, most importantly, I think that for decision-makers who occupy the current administration 政府 in the United States, as well as leadership in China and Russia, um, there are going to be tough 困难的；艰难的 decisions to make on arms control, disarmament, and future nuclear posture 姿态；态度 formulations 制定；构想. And so, this analysis is absolutely critical and timely 适时的；及时的.

菲奥娜的书实际上帮助我们理解中国的战略基本原理。这不仅仅是一个数学问题。我们需要了解中国的外交政策目标、北京在过去几十年中面临的困境，以及核威慑、常规威慑和信息时代能力在他们对世界及周边地区看法中的相关性和重要性。我认为这本书将是一个至关重要的贡献。它将帮助美国政策制定者、学者和全球专家理解当今中国在这些问题上的思维方式。最重要的是，我认为，对于现任美国政府的决策者，以及中国和俄罗斯的领导层而言，他们将不得不在军备控制、裁军和未来核态势制定方面做出艰难的决定。因此，这一分析至关重要且恰逢其时。

Um, and Fiona, I just want to congratulate 祝贺 you for publishing this. I think you appropriately bring the focus on this limited war dilemma 困境；进退两难 that has motivated 激发；促使 so many of the changing characteristics 特点；特征 of China’s nuclear buildup 增强；积累, as well as everything else they’re doing to advance 促进；推进 strategic 战略的 capabilities 能力；才能. Um, you highlight 突出；强调 for readers where these important debates 辩论；讨论 occurred 发生 within Beijing in a way that I don’t think we’ve been able to see in such a concise 简明的；简练的 way in unclassified 未机密的 publications 出版物 to date— and those critical 关键的；至关重要的 moments throughout history where these debates occurred: the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait Crisis 危机, the Belgrade bombing, reactions 反应 to U.S. policy statements, and nuclear posture 姿态；态度 reviews.

菲奥娜，我想祝贺你出版了这本书。我认为你恰当地把重点放在了这一"有限战争困境"上，这个困境促使了中国核力量增强的许多变化特征，以及他们为推进战略能力所做的一切。你为读者突出展示了这些重要的辩论在北京内部发生的过程，我认为这种简明的方式在迄今为止的非机密出版物中是前所未见的——以及历史上这些辩论发生的关键时刻：1995-96年台湾海峡危机、贝尔格莱德轰炸、对美国政策声明的反应以及核态势评估。

Um, and so I’m very happy to be here to moderate 主持；调解 the panel 小组. And without further ado 废话少说, let me introduce our panelists 小组成员 and then turn it over to Fiona. Um, so I want to applaud 赞扬；称赞 Mallerie Stewart, seated furthest away from me, for joining as a discussant 讨论者；评论者 today. She was the Assistant Secretary of State 国务卿助理 in the Bureau 局；办公室 of Arms Control, Deterrence 威慑, and Stability 稳定 in the Biden administration 政府, as well as my predecessor 前任 at the National Security Council. Um, and before that, she served as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Arms Control Bureau under the Obama administration and has served as a lawyer at the State Department Office of the Legal Adviser 顾问 since 2002.

因此，我非常高兴能在这里主持这场讨论会。废话不多说，让我介绍一下我们的嘉宾，然后再交给菲奥娜。首先，我要称赞今天作为讨论者加入的马勒里·斯图尔特，她坐在最远的位置。她曾是拜登政府负责军备控制、威慑与稳定事务的国务卿助理，同时也是我在国家安全委员会的前任。在此之前，她曾在奥巴马政府时期担任军备控制局的副助理国务卿，并自2002年以来一直在国务院法律顾问办公室担任律师。

Uh, Tong Zhao is a Senior Fellow 资深研究员 with the Nuclear Policy Program and Carnegie China, um, which is our—formerly Carnegie’s East Asia-based research center on contemporary 当代的；现代的 China. He was formerly based in Beijing and now conducts his research in Washington on strategic security 安全 issues. Um, he’s long been an expert 专家 on Chinese nuclear thinking. He’s a great collaborator 合作伙伴, and I welcome him to the panel as well.

赵通是卡内基国际和平基金会核政策项目和卡内基中国的资深研究员，该机构曾是卡内基基金会设在东亚的当代中国研究中心。他曾常驻北京，现在在华盛顿从事战略安全问题的研究。他长期以来一直是中国核战略思维领域的专家，是一位出色的合作伙伴，我也欢迎他加入这次讨论。

Finally, Fiona Cunningham, a non-resident 非常驻的 scholar 学者 here at the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment, as James introduced her previously. Uh, she’s made a contribution 贡献 with this book, and I look forward to seeing her succeed and continue to advance 推进；促进 the discourse 讨论；辩论 on China’s nuclear issues.

最后，菲奥娜·坎宁安，她是卡内基国际和平基金会核政策项目的非常驻学者，詹姆斯之前已经介绍过她。她通过这本书做出了重要贡献，我期待看到她取得成功，并继续推动关于中国核问题的讨论。

With that, let me turn it over to Fiona and anything that you’d like to say up front 预先；事先 about your book, and then we will move to moderated Q&A 问答环节.

接下来，我把话筒交给菲奥娜，请她分享一下关于她的书的想法，然后我们将进入主持问答环节。


==== Fiona Cunningham’s Remarks on Under the Nuclear Shadow
Fiona Cunningham:

Super. Uh, so I want to start by thanking both Pranav and James for your warm congratulations, uh, as well as your welcome. Uh, it’s an honor to be in the company of my fellow panelists, Tong and Mallerie, as well. I’m very grateful to the Nuclear Policy Program for hosting this event. And as James alluded to 暗指，影射, it’s very meaningful for me to be able to speak about my book here, given the fact that some of the key outstanding 悬而未决的；未解决的 questions and lingering 拖延的；持续的 issues with this manuscript 手稿；原稿 clicked into place 恰到好处；严丝合缝 while I was a Stanton Fellow here at Carnegie. So thank you to James, to Toby, to George, and to NPP colleagues, both past and present.

在这里，我首先想感谢 Pranav 和 James 的热烈祝贺以及热情欢迎。能够与我的同行小组成员 Tong 和 Mallerie 一起参与此活动，我深感荣幸。我非常感谢核政策计划（Nuclear Policy Program）主办此次活动。正如 James 所暗指的，对我来说，在这里谈论我的书具有重要意义，因为在我作为斯坦顿研究员（Stanton Fellow）期间，这本书中的一些关键悬而未决的问题和持续存在的疑问恰好找到了合适的答案。因此，我要感谢 James、Toby、George 以及所有过去和现在的 NPP 同事。

In my remarks, there are three things that I want to do. Uh, the first is that I’m going to introduce three big ideas in the book that I think make the case for why China’s approach to strategic deterrence 威慑 is different. The second thing is I want to outline 概述，勾勒 a little bit of how China’s approach has evolved 逐步发展；演变 over time. And then offer some thoughts on what the future holds for China’s strategic deterrence, building on the conclusion 结论；总结 of the book but hopefully helping to launch 发起，开始 our discussion as a panel.

在我的发言中，我想做三件事。首先，我将介绍书中的三个重要观点，我认为这些观点证明了中国的战略威慑方法为何与众不同。其次，我想简要概述中国战略威慑方法随时间演变的过程。最后，我将就中国战略威慑的未来发展提供一些看法，这些观点基于本书的结论，并希望能够帮助启动我们小组的讨论。

So, there are three big ideas in this book. The first is this idea of a limited war dilemma 进退两难的局面；困境, which is the problem at the core of the book; strategic substitution 替代；代替, which is the solution to that problem; and Information Age 信息时代 weapons, which implement 执行；实施 that solution. And you can think of them as the “why,” “what,” and “how” of China’s distinctive 独特的 approach to strategic deterrence.

因此，这本书有三个重要观点。第一个是有限战争困境，这是本书核心讨论的问题；其次是战略替代，这是对该问题的解决方案；最后是信息时代武器，它们用于执行该解决方案。可以将它们分别理解为中国独特战略威慑方法的“原因”、“内容”和“执行方式”。

So, the first idea is the limited war dilemma that Pranav briefly 简要地；简单地 mentioned 提及；说到 in his opening remarks. This book, I think, is about a central problem that all nuclear-armed states face when they’re confronting 面对；对抗 a nuclear-armed adversary 敌手；对手: How can they still continue to use their military capabilities to achieve political objectives—to coerce 胁迫；迫使 their adversaries—without triggering 引发；触发 what would be a catastrophic 灾难性的 nuclear war? And I want to emphasize 强调；重视 that no state has actually managed to solve this dilemma. We have two kinds of traditional options that most states have selected, which involve threatening the first use of nuclear weapons or threatening a decisive 决定性的；关键的 conventional 传统的；常规的 victory against one’s opponents, which is backed by nuclear forces that would deter 威慑；阻止 an adversary from overturning 推翻；颠覆 that victory by escalating 使加剧；使恶化 to the nuclear level. And all of these options have their advantages and disadvantages. Neither of them is a silver bullet 万能药；灵丹妙药.

第一个观点是有限战争困境，Pranav 在开场发言中曾简要提及。本书讨论的核心问题是，所有拥有核武器的国家在面对同样拥有核武器的对手时，都必须思考：他们如何能够继续利用自身的军事能力来实现政治目标——即胁迫对手——而不会引发灾难性的核战争？我要强调的是，实际上没有任何国家真正成功地解决了这一困境。现有的两种传统选择是大多数国家采取的方式：一种是威胁首先使用核武器，另一种是威胁通过决定性的常规胜利击败对手，同时依靠核力量来威慑对手，使其不敢通过升级到核战层面来推翻这场胜利。而这两种选择各有利弊，但都不是万能的解决方案。

But this does raise the question of what happens when you have a country that is sensitive to the disadvantages of both of them. And that was China’s situation. It did not view nuclear threats against a nuclear-armed adversary as credible 可信的；可靠的, and it was so conventionally inferior 劣势的；次等的 to the United States 25 years ago—when it began to grapple with 努力应对；设法解决 this dilemma—that it would have been decades before it had really been able to select that conventional option. And so, it didn’t adopt 采用；采纳 either of these answers to the limited war dilemma.

但这确实引出了一个问题：如果一个国家对这两种方式的弊端都很敏感，那么会发生什么？这正是中国所面临的情况。中国并不认为针对核武国家的核威胁是可信的，同时，在25年前，当中国开始努力应对这一困境时，在常规军事能力上远远落后于美国，如果选择常规胜利选项，可能需要几十年的时间才能真正具备实施这一选择的能力。因此，中国并未采取这两种方式来解决有限战争困境。

And that leads to the second key idea of strategic substitution. And this is the third option that China created for coping with the limited war dilemma. At its core, strategic substitution 替代 involves threatening to use non-nuclear weapons to escalate 升级 a conflict that can have strategic effects 战略效果 and change the calculations 计算；估算 of an adversary’s decision-maker, but pairing those non-nuclear strategic attacks with a retaliatory 报复性的 nuclear posture 核战略态势. And so, what that combination does is that it enables a state to increase the risk of escalation in a conflict—including up to the nuclear level—but without actually having to threaten to use its nuclear weapons first. In fact, it actually dares the adversary to be the first one to use nuclear weapons in response to these provocative 挑衅性的 non-nuclear attacks.

这就引出了第二个关键概念，即战略替代。这是中国为应对有限战争困境而创造的第三种选择。从本质上讲，战略替代涉及威胁使用非核武器来升级冲突，从而产生战略效果，并改变对手决策者的计算，但同时将这些非核战略攻击与报复性的核战略态势相结合。因此，这种组合使国家能够在冲突中增加升级的风险——甚至达到核级别——但实际上无需威胁首先使用其核武器。事实上，它实际上是在挑战对手，让对方成为第一个在这些挑衅性的非核攻击下使用核武器的一方。

And strategic substitution was appealing 具有吸引力的 to China because it offered quick and credible 可靠的 coercive 胁迫的 leverage 影响力, in contrast to the decades that it would need to redress 纠正 the conventional imbalance 传统军力失衡 with the United States. Um, and it was preferable 更可取的 to the first use of nuclear weapons, which was a more difficult option to make credible.

战略替代对中国具有吸引力，因为它提供了快速且可靠的胁迫影响力，而无需花费数十年时间来纠正与美国之间的传统军力失衡。此外，它比首先使用核武器更可取，因为后者是一个更难以让人信服的选项。

The third big idea in the book is that of Information Age 信息时代 weapons, which I argue could be used as substitutes in this strategic substitution approach because they promise to provide coercive leverage against nuclear-armed adversaries. And by Information Age weapons, I’m talking about conventional missiles that are used in a precision-strike 精确打击 capacity, relying on information networks to be guided to their targets, as well as counterspace 反空间作战 and offensive 进攻性的 cyber 网络 operations that disrupt 扰乱 an adversary’s satellites 卫星 and computer networks, respectively.

书中的第三个重要概念是信息时代武器，我认为这些武器可以作为战略替代方法中的替代手段，因为它们有望对核武器国家的对手提供胁迫影响力。所谓信息时代武器，我指的是用于精确打击的常规导弹，这些导弹依赖信息网络引导至目标，以及反空间作战和进攻性网络行动，分别用来干扰对手的卫星和计算机网络。

Some, but not all, of these weapons have the capacity to generate strategic effects because they can threaten large-scale 大规模的 damage against an adversary—its military, its society, its allies 盟友—that’s difficult to defend against. They cross key escalation thresholds 升级门槛 in limited wars between nuclear powers. And perhaps most importantly, they share technology with nuclear weapons, so they’re entangled 纠缠的—if you like, to use James’s term—with nuclear weapons in ways that generate inadvertent 非故意的 nuclear escalation risks if you choose to use them.

其中一些（但不是全部）武器具有产生战略效果的能力，因为它们可以对对手——包括其军队、社会和盟友——造成难以防御的大规模破坏。它们在核大国之间的有限战争中跨越了关键的升级门槛。或许最重要的是，它们与核武器共享技术，因此它们与核武器纠缠在一起，这种情况可能在使用这些武器时意外引发核升级风险。

But to generate coercive leverage, these weapons—you can’t just possess 拥有 them. You actually have to posture your capabilities, as well as your doctrine 军事原则, your organization 组织, and even your signaling 信号传递 to an adversary, in ways that optimize 优化 those components to generate coercive leverage. And China pursued a large conventional precision missile force after the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait Crisis 台海危机 and counterspace weapons and offensive cyber operations after the United States accidentally 误地 bombed 轰炸 China’s embassy 大使馆 in Belgrade 贝尔格莱德 in 1999 during the Kosovo 科索沃 air war—an incident 事件 that China’s leaders to this day do not accept was an accident.

但要产生胁迫影响力，仅仅拥有这些武器是不够的。国家实际上需要在能力部署、军事原则、组织结构甚至向对手传递信号等方面进行优化，以便最大化这些要素的胁迫效果。1995-96年台海危机后，中国发展了大规模的常规精确打击导弹部队；1999年，在科索沃空战期间，美国误炸中国驻贝尔格莱德大使馆后，中国进一步推进了反空间武器和进攻性网络作战。至今，中国领导人仍然不接受这是一起意外事件。

So, how has China’s approach to the use of these Information Age weapons evolved over time? I think three aspects are worth highlighting, although there’s more than that in the book—it’s many pages long. Um, first is that strategic substitution emerged from leverage deficits 影响力赤字 that China experienced because of crises with the United States over these two incidents I just mentioned: Taiwan and the Belgrade embassy bombing. And these crises alerted 警示了 China’s leaders to the fact that if there was a future Taiwan crisis, they were going to either fight a war that they were going to lose, or they would have to make humiliating 屈辱的 diplomatic 外交的 concessions 让步 if they didn’t go about generating more coercive leverage and augmenting 增强 the military capabilities that they had in ways that would make crises in the future more dangerous and costly for U.S. leaders. But China’s choice of strategic substitution took place at a time when its nuclear and conventional capabilities were significantly weaker than they are today.

那么，中国在使用这些信息时代武器的方法是如何随着时间演变的？我认为有三个值得强调的方面，尽管书中讨论的远不止这些。首先，战略替代源于中国在与美国的两次危机（即台海危机和贝尔格莱德大使馆轰炸事件）中所经历的影响力赤字。这些危机警示了中国领导人，如果未来再次发生台海危机，他们要么打一场注定失败的战争，要么不得不做出屈辱的外交让步，除非他们能够创造更多的胁迫影响力，并增强现有的军事能力，使未来的危机对美国领导人而言更加危险和昂贵。但需要注意的是，中国选择战略替代的时期，其核能力和常规能力远不如今天强大。

The second thing that’s worth pointing out about the evolution of these capabilities is that China’s coercive force postures 威慑性军事部署 for its three Information Age weapons 信息时代武器 evolved over time. After the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait Crisis 1995-96年台湾海峡危机, China sought a conventional missile force 常规导弹部队 that was going to be large, precise, and could target U.S. bases in East Asia 东亚. But initially, it lacked the precision-strike capability 精确打击能力—both in terms of accuracy 准确性 and the sensors 传感器 to support it—to be able to carefully calibrate 校准；调整 escalation 升级；加剧 in the way it used its conventional missiles. The real turning point 转折点 came around 2013 when it started to deploy more accurate 精确的 missiles and better sensing capabilities 传感能力. And here, you can think of the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile DF-26中程弹道导弹 as kind of emblematic 典型的；象征性的 of that change. And after that point, PLA doctrinal writings 解放军的军事理论著作 about how China would use these capabilities started to shift from describing both military 军事的 and civilian 平民的；非军事的 targets for these attacks to military-only 仅限军事目标 ones.

第二点值得指出的是，这些能力的发展过程中，中国的三种信息时代武器的威慑性军事部署也在不断演变。
在1995-96年台湾海峡危机后，中国寻求建立一支规模庞大、精确度高且能打击美国在东亚军事基地的常规导弹部队。 但最初，它缺乏精确打击能力——无论是在准确性方面，还是在支持精准打击所需的传感器方面——因此无法在使用常规导弹时精确控制升级的程度。 真正的转折点出现在2013年左右， 当时中国开始部署更精确的导弹和更先进的传感能力。 在这方面，DF-26中程弹道导弹 可以被视为这一变化的典型代表。 从那时起，中国人民解放军的军事理论著作关于这些能力的使用方式开始发生变化， 从原本描述既能打击军事目标，也能打击民用目标，转向仅针对军事目标的攻击方式。

China’s cyber force posture 网络战部署 also evolved over time—from one that really exacerbated 加剧 the risk of uncontrolled escalation 失控升级 (what I call a “brinkmanship posture” “边缘政策式部署”) to one that tried to tame 控制；抑制 them. And this occurred, I think, fairly abruptly 突然地 between the years of 2012 and 2014, as China’s leaders decided to exert 发挥；行使 a lot more control 控制 and centralize 集中 the command structure 指挥体系 for their cyber capabilities 网络能力. But this shift is not a technological story 技术性转变. This is one, instead, about leaders 领导层 feeling greater vulnerability 脆弱性 to cyber attacks 网络攻击 themselves because China rapidly digitized 数字化 as a society 社会, a military 军队, and a government 政府—and therefore that forced China’s leaders to really want to control the use of 掌控…的使用 those capabilities more carefully.

中国的网络战部署也随着时间的推移而演变， 从一种极大加剧失控升级风险的模式（我称之为“边缘政策式部署”），转变为一种试图控制升级风险的模式。 这一变化发生得相当突然，大约在2012年至2014年间， 当时中国领导层决定加强控制，并集中指挥其网络战能力。 但这一转变并非是技术上的变化， 而更多是因为中国迅速数字化， 无论是在社会、军事还是政府层面， 这使得领导层自身对网络攻击的脆弱性大幅增加， 迫使他们更加谨慎地控制这些能力的使用。

The final point 最后一点 on the evolution 演变 is one of the reasons why China’s postures 部署 evolved is related to U.S. countermeasures 美国的对策. So, China’s conventional missile force 常规导弹部队, I think, is one of the biggest headaches 令人头疼的问题 for military planners 军事策划者 here in Washington 华盛顿, as well as in the Indo-Pacific 印太地区 and in the region itself 该地区本身. But its leverage 影响力 might actually end up being relatively fleeting 短暂的 as the United States shed 摆脱 the constraints 限制 of the INF Treaty 《中导条约》 and is seeking to counter 反制 China’s advantages 优势 by deploying 部署 similar capabilities 能力 in the region 地区.

In the cyber domain 网络领域, in the last eight years or so, the U.S. has also begun to rethink 重新思考 this problem—from being one of a “cyber Pearl Harbor” “网络珍珠港” it would have to prepare for 应对, to being really more like a “death by a thousand cuts” “千刀万剐式的打击” from lower-level cyber attacks 低级别网络攻击 under the threshold 临界点 of armed conflict 武装冲突. So, in preparing for this different way of thinking about 准备应对这一新的思考方式, the effects 影响 of cyber challenges 网络挑战, this has robbed China of 剥夺了中国的… some of the coercive leverage 威慑性影响力 it would otherwise have from threatening 威胁 a “cyber Pearl Harbor,” but also has enabled 使…成为可能 the U.S. to develop 发展 tools 工具 and techniques 技术 to disrupt 破坏 Chinese preparations for 准备 cyber attacks before they’re actually executed 执行 in peacetime 和平时期.

关于这一演变的最后一点是，中国的军事部署演变的部分原因与美国的对策有关。
中国的 常规导弹部队，可以说是 华盛顿、印太地区 以及 该地区的军事策划者 面临的最棘手问题之一。 但这种 影响力 可能最终会 相对短暂，因为美国已经 摆脱了《中导条约》的限制，并正在 通过在该地区部署类似能力来反制中国的军事优势。

在 网络领域，过去八年左右的时间里，美国也开始 重新审视这一问题，从最初认为需要 防范“网络珍珠港”式的重大攻击，转变为更倾向于 应对“千刀万剐式的打击”， 即在 武装冲突临界点以下的低级别网络攻击。
因此，在 为这种不同的网络挑战影响进行准备的过程中，这 削弱了中国通过威胁发动“网络珍珠港”攻击所能获得的一些威慑力， 但同时也 使美国能够开发工具和技术，在中国的网络攻击真正执行之前，就在和平时期破坏其准备工作。

In space, the United States is changing its satellite architecture 建筑结构；体系 from one based on big, juicy-target-type satellites to one that complements those satellites with ones that are of lower value and smaller—that blunts 削弱；消减 the leverage 影响力；筹码 China could gain from any individual anti-satellite 反卫星 weapon. And China is also now concerned that the U.S. is developing the full suite of its own counterspace 反空间 capabilities 能力；实力 as well.

【中文翻译】
在太空领域，美国正在将其卫星体系从以大型、易受攻击目标型卫星为基础转变为用低价值且更小型的卫星来补充，这削弱了中国可能从任何单一反卫星武器中获得的影响力。同时，中国也开始担忧美国正在发展其全套的反太空能力。

So, what does the future hold for China’s strategic 战略的 substitution 替代；代替 approach? I think, on the one hand, China’s Information Age 信息时代 weapons haven’t necessarily lived up to 达到预期；符合预期 the promise that its leaders saw in them back 25 years ago when they started to develop them. And perhaps we can’t blame them because these were often relatively nascent 初生的；萌芽的 technologies—nascent 初生的；萌芽的 changes in the way that society was using some of them. Um, so they can be forgiven for overhype 过分宣传；夸大 of the leverage 影响力；筹码 they would get. But in other cases, China actually did succeed in gaining coercive 强制的；威逼的 leverage 影响力；筹码, only to see that blunted 削弱；消减 by U.S. countermeasures 对策；反措施 within that timeframe 时间框架；时限.

那么，中国的战略替代方法的未来将如何发展？我认为，一方面，中国的信息时代武器未必完全实现了其领导人25年前开发时所预见的承诺。也许我们不能责怪他们，因为这些往往是初生的、萌芽中的技术——社会在使用这些技术的方式也正处于初步变化中。嗯，因此，他们可以被原谅过分宣传所能获得的影响力；但在其他情况下，中国实际上确实成功地获得了威逼性的影响力，只不过这种影响力在那段时间内被美国的对策削弱了。

China’s nuclear and conventional 常规的 capabilities 能力；实力 have also improved out of sight 极大地；显著地 in the past decade, which is going to make any of those traditional options a little bit more appealing than they were in 1995. But on the other hand, I think it’s worth pointing out some limits to those modernization 现代化 campaigns 运动；战役. China’s conventional 常规的 capabilities 能力；实力, I don’t think, yet can threaten a decisive 决定性的；关键性的 victory in a Taiwan contingency 突发事件；应急情况 in which the United States intervenes 干预；介入. It may be much more of a kind of stalemate 僵局；平局, or no clear winner. And there’s a pretty high bar that states need for their conventional 常规的 capabilities 能力；实力 to really rely upon them for coercive 强制的；威逼的 leverage 影响力；筹码.

【中文翻译】
中国的核武和常规能力在过去十年中也得到了极大提升，这将使得那些传统选项比1995年时更具吸引力。但另一方面，我认为有必要指出这些现代化运动的一些局限。中国的常规能力，目前尚不足以在美国介入的台湾突发事件中威胁取得决定性的胜利。局面可能更像是一种僵局，或者没有明显的赢家。而且，各国要真正依赖其常规能力来发挥威逼影响力，需要达到相当高的标准。

I also—perhaps more controversially 有争议地—don’t see China’s nuclear modernization 现代化 as evidence that it is seeking a first-use 首次使用；首次出击 nuclear strategy that spells the end 表示结束；意味着终结 of strategic 战略的 substitution 替代；代替. Yes, that modernization 现代化 is going to enable 使能够；促使 China to make more credible 可信的；可靠的 threats of first use 首次使用；首次出击 because it’s a larger force, it has better theater forces 战区部队；作战部队, and sits at a higher state of readiness 战备状态；准备状态. But I do ask: Where are the tactical nuclear weapons 战术核武器；战术核弹 with nuclear armaments 核武装；核军备 for China? Why hasn’t it changed its “no first use 不首先使用核武器政策” policy if it really wants to get the maximum out of a first-use posture 首次使用态势；首次出击姿态? Where is the evidence of an operational doctrine 作战原则；作战学说 for the first use 首次使用；首次出击 of nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict 常规冲突；常规战争? And is there evidence that China now has more confidence that threatening nuclear first use against a nuclear-armed adversary 拥有核武器的对手；核武装敌人 would be credible 可信的；可靠的—which is precisely the calculation 计算；考量, or the doubts, that China’s leaders previously had that pushed them towards strategic 战略的 substitution 替代；代替?

【中文翻译】
我也——也许更具争议性地——不认为中国的核现代化表明其正在寻求一种首次使用核武器的战略，从而意味着终结战略替代。是的，这种现代化将使中国能够提出更可信的首次使用威胁，因为它的军力更大，拥有更优秀的战区部队，并处于更高的战备状态。但我确实要问：为中国的战术核武器、核军备在哪里？如果中国真的想从首次使用态势中获得最大的效益，为什么不改变其“不首先使用核武器政策”？关于在常规冲突中首次使用核武器的作战原则，有什么证据？又有何证据表明中国现在更有信心，相信对拥有核武器的对手威胁首次使用核武器会被认为是可信的——这正是中国领导人此前的计算或考量，促使他们转向战略替代？

There’s ongoing ambiguity 模糊性；含糊 over China’s motivations for its nuclear modernization 现代化, but I’m relatively convinced that both U.S. capabilities 能力；实力 and strategy, as well as the pursuit of political effects that having a bigger and better arsenal 武器库；军火库 might have on U.S. decision-making 决策；决定过程—as some of Tong’s work has shown, especially in a Taiwan contingency 突发事件；应急情况—are key reasons for it. But thus far, I think that China’s nuclear buildup 增长；积累 is actually responding to different problems than a search for coercive 强制的；威逼的 leverage 影响力；筹码. So, although China might have a better grip on the limits of strategic 战略的 substitution 替代；代替, it still doesn’t appear to have found a better option. I’ll leave it there.

【中文翻译】
对于中国核现代化的动机，依然存在着模糊性，但我相当确信，美国的能力和战略，以及拥有更大、更好的武器库可能对美国决策产生的政治效应的追求——正如Tong的一些研究所显示的，尤其是在台湾突发事件中——都是关键原因。但到目前为止，我认为中国的核扩充实际上是在应对与追求威逼影响力不同的问题。所以，尽管中国可能更好地掌握了战略替代的局限，但它似乎仍未找到更好的选择。我就说到这里。

==== Moderated Discussion: Limited War Scenarios and Escalation Risks
Pranav Vadhyar:
Great, thanks for that, Fiona. Um, so I will take the privilege 特权；荣幸 of being moderator 主持人 to ask a few questions, and then we will come to the audience 观众，听众, both here and watching on YouTube. Um, so, uh, I guess my first couple of questions, Fiona, I’ll start with you, then I would appreciate Tong and Mallerie weighing in 参与；发表意见 too.

【中文翻译】
普拉纳夫·瓦迪亚：
谢谢，费欧娜。嗯，我将享有作为主持人的特权，提几个问题，然后我们将转向现场和YouTube上的观众。嗯，我的第一个问题，费欧娜，我从你开始，然后我也希望汤和马雷里能参与讨论。

First, I was wondering if you could kind of walk us through 一步步讲解；引导 us through one of these limited war scenarios 场景；局面—and it can involve 包含 fictional 想象的 countries 国家 if you wish. Um, you know, I’m trying to better understand 更好地理解 what about China’s approach to strategic 战略的 deterrence 威慑，包括这些 Information Age capabilities 信息时代能力, um, do you find will make U.S. decisions to escalate 升级；加剧 or not more difficult? Um, there’s a certain amount of ambiguity 模糊性；不明确性 that comes with using these Information Age capabilities, but they also run the risk 风险 of, you know, incidentally 偶然地；意外地 striking 打击 what the U.S. considers 认为 to be a strategic asset 战略资产 or a vital 重要的 interest 利益, depending on the type of capability 能力 used and depending on the type of target 目标 it’s used against. So, imagine counterspace 反太空 attacks 攻击 or attacks against allied cyber 网络 infrastructure 基础设施. Um, what do you see in this approach that makes that decision-making here in Washington 华盛顿 very fuzzy 模糊的；不清晰的?

【中文翻译】
首先，我想知道你是否能一步步讲解一下这些有限战争的情境——如果你愿意的话，可以涉及虚构的国家。嗯，你知道，我正在努力更好地理解中国的战略威慑方法，特别是这些信息时代的能力，你认为这些方法如何使美国在是否升级的决策上更困难？嗯，使用这些信息时代能力带来了一定的模糊性，但它们也存在风险，即不小心打击到美国认为是战略资产或至关重要利益的目标，这取决于使用的能力类型以及目标的类型。所以，想象一下反太空攻击或对盟国网络基础设施的攻击。嗯，你怎么看待这种方法，使得在华盛顿的决策变得非常模糊？

And then, I guess, relatedly, um, what are the biggest risks of the PRC’s approach to intent 意图；目的 and escalation 升级；加剧?

【中文翻译】
然后，相关地，嗯，中国在意图和升级方面的方法最大的风险是什么？

Fiona Cunningham:

So, I think what makes this calculation 计算；估算，in some ways, difficult for Washington is that the way China thinks about deploying 部署；使用 some of these capabilities—and you see this described in the doctrine 学说；理论—um, that, for example, China would engage in large-scale 大规模的 cyber 攻击 on U.S. critical infrastructure 关键基础设施 on the homeland 本土, um, or that it might think about attacking counterspace 反太空 assets 资产；财产, some of which are in lower orbits 轨道；绕行, which may be particularly 特别的；尤其 important for the way that the U.S. thinks about its conventional strike 常规打击 capabilities 能力；实力. You see a little bit less about China basically thinking about attacking assets that are specifically 专门的 designed 设计 to limit 限制；约束 the U.S.’s use of its own nuclear weapons 核武器—so its NC3 assets 核指挥、控制和通信资产, for example—although it certainly is starting to, I believe, develop 开发；发展 capabilities 能力；实力 that would enable 使能够 it to target 目标 these systems 系统 as well.

【中文翻译】
费欧娜·坎宁安：
所以，我认为，让华盛顿在某些方面难以做出这一计算的原因是，中国在部署这些能力时的思考方式——你可以在其学说中看到这一点——例如，中国可能会对美国本土的关键基础设施发动大规模网络攻击，或者它可能会考虑攻击一些反太空资产，其中一些位于低轨道，这对于美国如何看待其常规打击能力尤为重要。你看到中国较少考虑攻击那些专门设计来限制美国使用其核武器的资产——例如其NC3资产——尽管我相信它确实开始开发能够瞄准这些系统的能力。

And I think what’s difficult, uh, or what the underlying 基本的 piece 部分 of China’s thinking about strategic 战略的 substitution 替代；代替 is here, um, is that there’s still a decision 决定 that has to be made by a country 国家 to respond 响应；回应 to these provocative 挑衅的；刺激性的 attacks 攻击—to use nuclear weapons 核武器 first or to initiate 发起 nuclear 威胁 威胁 first. And the gamble 赌博；冒险, in some ways, of strategic 战略的 substitution 替代；代替 is actually that there’s a bluff：a adversary 对手；敌人 is not going to be willing to fight 打核战争 for whatever 它所关心的事物 it is that’s at stake 关系到的；在此关头 in the Indo-Pacific 印太地区. Um, and so, if you attack 这些 kinds of assets 资产；财产, it’s going to be very provocative 挑衅的；刺激的, um, but it is not going to necessarily 必然地 generate 产生 the response 响应 of an adversary 对手；敌人 using nuclear weapons 核武器 first.

【中文翻译】
我认为，中国关于战略替代思维的难点在于，国家仍然需要做出回应这些挑衅性攻击的决策——是首先使用核武器还是发起核威胁。某种意义上，战略替代的赌注实际上是一种虚张声势：敌人不会愿意为了印太地区所涉及的任何事情而打核战争。嗯，因此，如果你攻击这些类型的资产，它将非常具有挑衅性，但这并不一定会产生敌人首先使用核武器的回应。

So, China is trying to essentially drive 推动 the U.S. right up to that nuclear nuclear threshold 临界点 but get it to be the one that backs down 退缩 because it’s not willing to cross 超越 that bright line 明线 and use nuclear weapons 核武器 first—or even start to initiate 发起 nuclear threats 威胁. So, the fuzzy 模糊的 decision-making 决策, I think, for Washington 华盛顿 in this situation is—I mean, how many of these high-value assets 高价值资产 do you absorb 吸收 damage 损害 to? Are there other ways in which you can deter 威慑 them than threaten 威胁 the first use of nuclear weapons? Um, you know, what stakes 争论；风险 are actually at play 起作用 in an Indo-Pacific 印太地区 conflict 冲突, and how are they going to change 改变 over the course of a conflict 冲突 if a country 国家 like China is starting to erode 削弱 some of these key aspects 关键方面 of U.S. military power 军事力量—if it’s attacking 攻击 bases 基地 in allied countries 盟国, if it’s engaging in the use of force 使用武力 against the U.S. homeland 本土, even with these non-kinetic strikes 非动能打击? That, in and of itself, can sort of change 改变 the stakes of a conflict 冲突 as well, from being just about, let’s say, the defense 防御 of Taiwan to ones where it really starts to become about responses to the damage 损害 that China is inflicting 施加 throughout the course 过程 of a conflict 冲突.

【中文翻译】
所以，中国基本上是在试图将美国推向那个核武器的临界点，但希望美国是那个退缩的，因为它不愿意越过那条明线，首先使用核武器——甚至开始发起核威胁。所以，在这种情况下，我认为华盛顿的决策是模糊的——我意思是，你能承受多少这些高价值资产的损害？有没有其他方式来威慑它们，而不是威胁首先使用核武器？嗯，你知道，在印太地区冲突中，实际的风险是什么，冲突过程中如果像中国这样的国家开始削弱美国军事力量的某些关键方面——如果它攻击盟国的基地，如果它正在对美国本土进行武力使用，即使是这些非动能打击？这本身就能改变冲突的风险，从仅仅是防御台湾变成更广泛地关于对中国在冲突过程中施加损害的回应。

So, I see that as kind of the dilemma 困境；两难 that China is thinking through 思考的. Obviously, 显然 the use 使用 of some of these capabilities 能力 can also damage 损害 U.S. nuclear-supporting 支持核的 assets 资产. Uh, China itself itself itself doesn’t have a counterforce doctrine 对抗力量学说, as is my understanding 理解, and so they might look at that and say, “Well, you can’t say 不能说 just because we have offensive 攻击性的 cyber 网络 operations 操作 or because we have counterspace 反太空 weapons 武器 that the design 设计 here is actually to diminish 减少 your ability 能力 to use nuclear weapons 核武器 first.” But that doesn’t necessarily mean 不一定 mean that the U.S. isn’t going to look at weapons 武器 that can be retargeted 重新瞄准, weapons where you can’t necessarily 并非总是 observe 观察 what it is that they’re targeting 目标, or, in the case of cyber operations, even see 看到 where your assets 资产 have been compromised 破坏—and be able to react 反应 in a relatively 相对的 measured 衡量的 manner 方式.

【中文翻译】
所以，我认为这是中国正在思考的困境。显然，使用这些能力中的一些也能损害美国的核支持资产。嗯，中国本身似乎没有对抗力量学说，按照我的理解，他们可能会这样看待这个问题并说：“嗯，你不能说仅仅因为我们有攻击性网络操作或反太空武器，这里的设计实际上是为了减少你首先使用核武器的能力。”但这并不意味着美国不会考虑可以重新瞄准的武器，或者是那些你无法完全观察它们目标的武器，或者在网络操作的情况下，甚至无法看到你的资产被破坏——并且能够以一种相对有分寸的方式做出反应。

Um, so I think the real question 问题 for the U.S. and its allies 同盟国 in thinking about how to respond 响应 to strategic 战略的 substitution 替代 is how to avoid 避免 sort of taking the bait 上当；上钩 of thinking of this as a nuclear 核 escalation 升级 scenario 情境 and finding ways 找到方法 to fight through 克服这些 provocative 挑衅的 attacks 攻击, uh, without diminishing 削弱 their ability 能力 to fight 作战 conventional 常规的 operations 作战, but also without escalating 升级 to the nuclear 核 level 水平—because then the logic 逻辑 of strategic 战略的 substitution 替代 starts to fall flat 失败，站不住脚, because China has to come up with 提出 a Plan B 备用计划 if these attacks 攻击 don’t have 没有 the intended 预期的 effect 效果.

【中文翻译】
嗯，我认为美国及其盟国在思考如何应对战略替代时面临的真正问题是如何避免上钩，把这看作一个核升级的情境，并找到方法克服这些挑衅性攻击，嗯，不削弱它们进行常规作战的能力，同时也不升级到核水平——因为那时战略替代的逻辑就站不住脚了，因为如果这些攻击没有产生预期效果，中国必须提出一个备用计划。

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks for that. Tong, anything you’d like to add?

【中文翻译】
普拉纳夫·瓦迪亚：
谢谢，汤，有什么想补充的吗？

Tong Zhao:

Um, sure. You know, I think this research really helps us trace the evolution 发展 of China’s strategic 战略的 security 安全 thinking 思维. I think Fiona, you know, is among one of the first scholars 学者 to actually do the cutting-edge cutting-edge research 前沿研究—look at China’s traditional 传统的 thinking 思维 on escalation 升级, which is: China generally 通常 dismisses 不考虑 the risk 风险 of crossing 超越 the nuclear threshold 核门槛 and dismisses 不考虑 the possibility 可能性 of managing 管理 escalation 升级 once the nuclear threshold 核门槛 is crossed. Um, and then her most recent 近期的 research 研究, uh, reflects 反映, I think, increasing 增长的 Chinese interest 兴趣 over the past couple of decades 几十年, at least, in becoming more interested 更加关注 in understanding 理解 escalation dynamics 升级动态 and managing 管理 escalation 升级.

【中文翻译】
汤·赵：
嗯，当然。你知道，我认为这项研究真的帮助我们追溯了中国战略安全思维的演变。我认为费欧娜是最早做前沿研究的学者之一——研究中国传统的升级思维，通常中国忽视越过核门槛的风险，也忽视一旦核门槛被跨越后如何管理升级的可能性。嗯，然后她最新的研究反映了过去几十年中国在理解升级动态和管理升级方面越来越感兴趣。

This limited war dilemma 限制性战争困境, I think, reflects 反映 China’s deeper 更深的 thinking 思维 on managing 管理 military escalation 军事升级. Um, and the Chinese solution, 解决方案 as Fiona identified, reflects 反映 a general 一般的 strategy 战略. I think there is actually some similarity 相似性 between the Chinese and Western approaches, 方法, which is: you want to give yourself more options 更多的选择, more freedom 自由, more flexibility 灵活性. So, you add more rungs 梯级 to the escalation ladder 升级梯子—you add more tools 工具 that allow you to respond 响应 in various scales 各种规模 or intensities 强度 to different levels of conflict 冲突. So, you’ll see China starting with, you know, nuclear-level deterrence 核级威慑 capability 能力 and then prioritizing 优先考虑 non-nuclear 非核的 strategic 战略的 weapons 武器—or Information Age weapons 信息时代武器—and then, when China’s money and resources 资源 allow, China focuses more on the lower end 较低端: the general-purpose 普通用途的 conventional 常规的 capabilities 能力. So now it has full-spectrum 全谱 flexibility 灵活性.

【中文翻译】
这个限制性战争的困境，我认为，反映了中国在管理军事升级方面更深层次的思考。嗯，正如费欧娜所指出的，中国的解决方案反映了一种总体战略。我认为，中国和西方的方法之间确实有一些相似性，那就是：你想给自己更多的选择、更多的自由和更多的灵活性。因此，你在升级梯子上增加更多的台阶——你增加更多的工具，这些工具可以让你根据不同的冲突层次和强度做出各种规模的反应。所以你会看到中国从核级威慑能力开始，然后优先考虑非核战略武器——或信息时代武器——然后，当中国的资金和资源允许时，更多地专注于较低端：普通用途的常规能力。所以，现在它拥有全谱的灵活性。

Um, and I think that’s not that dissimilar 不太不同 to the Western approach, which means 意味着 managing 管理 escalation 升级—including conventional 常规的 all the way to all-out 全面 nuclear war 核战争—is going to be more important 更加重要 in China-U.S. or China-West military competition 军事竞争. I think this research 研究 definitely 无疑 helps us really 实际上 understand 理解 that dynamic 动态 much better 更好地. Um, I think when both sides—U.S. and China—now think 想 about escalating 升级, managing 管理 escalation 升级, um, it certainly 一定 gives us both challenges 挑战 and opportunities 机会. Opportunities 机会 in the sense that we both understand 理解 the risk 风险 of uncontrolled 失控的 escalation 升级, as Fiona identified. Uh, initially 最初, Chinese weapons 武器 were not good enough 不够强大, so China couldn’t really 实际上 control 控制 the escalation risk 升级风险, but over time 随着时间推移, China becomes 变得 both more capable 有能力的 and also 更愿意 more willing to tailor 定制 the escalation risk 升级风险.

【中文翻译】
嗯，我认为这与西方的方法并不太不同，这意味着管理升级——包括从常规到全面核战争——将变得在中美或中西方军事竞争中更加重要。我认为这项研究无疑帮助我们更好地理解这一动态。嗯，我认为，当现在两方——美国和中国——考虑升级、管理升级时，它肯定会带来挑战和机会。机会在于我们都理解失控升级的风险，正如费欧娜所指出的。嗯，最初，中国的武器不够强大，所以中国实际上无法控制升级风险，但随着时间的推移，中国变得既更有能力，也更愿意定制升级风险。

Uh, so the challenge 挑战 becomes 变成: How do we reach 达成 basic 基本的 understandings 理解 of what certain actions 行动 are more escalatory 升级的 or less escalatory 不太升级的? What are the other’s escalation thresholds 升级门槛 or red lines 红线? I think that offers 提供 opportunities 机会 for more in-depth 更深入的 discussions 讨论. Um, but on the other hand, when both sides are now more committed 承诺 to managing 管理 escalation 升级—increasing 增加 one’s own 自己的 advantage 优势 in managing 管理 escalation 升级—that also drives 推动 new arms race 新的军备竞赛 dynamics 动力. So, um, I think this is, you know, that’s why I think everyone will really need to read 阅读 Fiona’s book 书 to understand 理解 what future 未来的 U.S.-China 中美 competition 竞争 is going to look like.

【中文翻译】
嗯，所以，挑战变成了：我们如何达成对某些行为是否更具升级性或不太升级的基本理解？对方的升级门槛或红线是什么？我认为这为更深入的讨论提供了机会。嗯，但另一方面，当双方现在都更加致力于管理升级——增加自己在管理升级方面的优势——这也推动了新的军备竞赛动力。所以，嗯，我认为这就是为什么我认为每个人都需要阅读费欧娜的书，以理解未来中美竞争将会是什么样子。

Pranav Vadhyar:

Yeah, it goes without saying: read and cite the book 书. Um, we’re all going to be doing that, I think, in the coming months. Mallerie, anything you want to chime in on this topic?

【中文翻译】
普拉纳夫·瓦迪亚：
是的，不用说了：阅读并引用这本书。嗯，我想在接下来的几个月里我们都会这样做。马勒里，有什么想补充的吗？

Mallerie Stewart:

Yeah, I mean, I completely agree with what has been said, and especially the fact that Fiona has taken 承担 an issue 问题 that really did need 需要 investigation 调查 and looked at 查看 primary sources 主要来源—looked at policy 政策 that hasn’t been looked at 未曾被看过 comprehensively 全面地 by the U.S. government 美国政府 or U.S. commentators 评论员 ever. And I think that was really 真正 important 重要 and something that we need to focus on 关注 going forward 前进.

【中文翻译】
马勒里·斯图尔特：
是的，我完全同意已说的内容，尤其是费欧娜处理了一个真正需要调查的问题，并查看了主要来源——审视了美国政府或美国评论员从未全面审视过的政策。我认为这真的很重要，而且是我们需要关注的事情。

Um, what I sort of take from the question, Pranav, was sort of the risks involved 风险 in some of these efforts 努力 to manage escalation 管理升级—some of these efforts 努力 to use strategic substitution 战略替代 to avoid 避免, potentially 可能的, a nuclear conflict 核冲突 from being the automatic outcome 自动结果 of spiraling conflicts 螺旋式冲突. And I think, you know, one of the risks 风险 is an overreliance 过度依赖 on the effort 努力 to understand 理解 escalation 升级. And I think Fiona points 指出 that out quite well: with these strategic substitutions, there’s an assumption 假设 that China sort of takes on 承担—that it can push 推动 the U.S. to the edge 边缘, not force them over the nuclear precipice 核崖, and not force them to use nuclear response 核反应 to a non-nuclear challenge 非核挑战. But there’s an assumption that, “Yes, we can use cyber weapons 网络武器, we can use precision strike 精确打击 and our space weapon capability 太空武器能力 to leverage the U.S. in a way that will prevent 防止 a nuclear war 核战争 but will also make them feel vulnerable 易受攻击 to our persuasion 说服.”

【中文翻译】
嗯，我从普拉纳夫的问题中得到的一点是，这些努力管理升级的风险——使用战略替代来避免潜在的核冲突成为螺旋式冲突的自动结果。我认为，风险之一是过度依赖于理解升级的努力。我认为费欧娜很好地指出了这一点：通过这些战略替代，有一种假设是中国承担了——它可以将美国推到边缘，但不让他们越过核崖，也不强迫他们对非核挑战作出核反应。但假设是，“是的，我们可以使用网络武器，精确打击和我们的太空武器能力，以一种方式施加影响，使美国避免核战争，但也会让他们感觉易受我们的说服影响。”

And I think the risk 风险 there is that escalation management 升级管理 and escalation dynamics 升级动态 are constantly 不断地 in flux 变化, right? And your point 观点, that I think is very well conveyed 表达 in the book, is there’s an arms race 军备竞赛 in strategic substitution 战略替代. There’s an arms race 军备竞赛 in escalation management 升级管理. There’s constantly 不断的 a desire 渴望 to minimize 最小化 the leverage 杠杆 of potential adversaries 潜在对手 through these alternative alternatives 选择. And so, we see 看到 the massive 大规模 proliferation 扩散 of space architectures 太空架构 with numerous satellites 卫星 to defeat 击败 a potential potential 可能的 direct-ascent destructive ASAT capacity 反卫星能力 that China has demonstrated. We see 看到 the U.S. building up 建立 cyber defenses 网络防御 and trying 尝试 to, in the arms race 军备竞赛 of the cyber arena 网络领域, always 始终 stay a step ahead 领先一步 with respect to defenses 防御.

【中文翻译】
我认为，那里存在的风险是，升级管理和升级动态不断变化，对吧？而你所指出的观点，我认为在书中表达得很好，那就是战略替代中存在军备竞赛。在升级管理方面也有军备竞赛。不断地希望通过这些替代选择最小化潜在对手的杠杆。因此，我们看到太空架构的大规模扩散，通过大量卫星来击败中国所展示的可能的直接升空摧毁性反卫星能力。我们还看到美国在建立网络防御，并在网络领域的军备竞赛中，始终保持领先一步，专注于防御。

And I think the challenge 挑战 is when a country 国家 so focuses 专注 on managing 管理 escalation dynamics 升级动态 without 没有 the equivalent 等效 reliance 依赖 on understanding 理解 the other side’s response 对方的回应, understanding 理解 the other side’s engagement 对方的参与—or the point 观点 you also make 很好地: the entanglement challenge 纠缠挑战, right? If we don’t know if this satellite 卫星 is purely 纯粹 for conventional purposes 常规目的 or has a nuclear C3 element 核C3元素 to it, can we truly 真正 say 说 that targeting 目标 that satellite 卫星 will not not 会 not cross 逾越 a threshold 门槛 that we did not 未曾 anticipate 预料 in advance 预料到?

【中文翻译】
我认为，挑战在于，当一个国家如此专注于管理升级动态时，却没有等效地依赖于理解对方的反应、对方的参与——或者你也提到的一个很好的观点：纠缠挑战，对吧？如果我们不知道这颗卫星是否仅仅是用于常规目的，还是包含核C3元素，我们能否真正说，针对这颗卫星的打击不会突破我们未曾预料到的门槛？

I think that is why—and your book concludes 结论, and I’m not going to give any spoilers 透露剧透—but I think it does make a really good point 一个很好的观点 that our arms control arms control efforts 军备控制 efforts, our risk reduction efforts 风险减少 efforts, have to evolve 演变 to take into account 考虑 the escalatory 管理升级 challenge 挑战 that China has now gotten its head around 理解 and thinks 认为, perhaps 也许, that it’s really 真正 understanding 理解, in an arena 领域 which is very challenging 困难 to understand 理解, right? Because there is no really 没有真正的 fulsome 完整的, direct 直接的 government-to-government engagement 政府间的互动. And I think that is a risk 风险 that is implied 含蓄 in, if not directly 直接地, in your book 书—that needs to be more comprehensively 更全面地 addressed 解决 by both governments 政府 in the future 未来.

【中文翻译】
我认为这就是为什么——而你的书总结了这一点，我不会透露任何剧透——但我认为它确实提出了一个很好的观点，我们的军备控制努力，我们的风险减少努力，必须发展以考虑到中国现在已经理解并认为自己可能真正理解的升级管理挑战，在一个非常困难理解的领域，对吧？因为没有真正的、直接的政府对政府的互动。我认为这是一种隐含的风险，若不是直接地，就在你的书中——这需要未来两国政府更全面地解决。

Pranav Vadhyar:

And Mallerie, you will be the lead-off hitter 打头阵 on a risk reduction 风险减少 question 问题 that is coming up, so we can dive into that a little bit more.

【中文翻译】
普拉纳夫·瓦迪亚：
马勒里，您将成为接下来的风险减少问题的打头阵者，我们可以稍后深入探讨这个问题。


==== Discussion on Multiple Conflicts and Risk Reduction
Pranav Vadhyar:

One thing I want to touch upon, though, that all three of you have pointed to but not said directly is—um, all of this, this book is being published and is available for people to read now. Um, everything that’s happening in the U.S. government—I mean, all of this is happening in the context of the United States, China, Russia, many of our European allies, many of our Asian allies, seeing the risk of limited war between nuclear powers as increasing, right? I mean, it’s not—I’m not being scientific about it; I’m just stating what I think is obvious and something that the Chinese detected in the early ‘90s. And as a result—thanks to your research, Fiona—you’ve helped explain why they’ve made certain investments and developed certain capabilities all the way through to today.

Um, but, you know, from a U.S. perspective, the United States is looking at the possibility that conflict could emerge in Europe with Russia, um, for example, and then, either at the same time or in the near aftermath, having to potentially deal with conflict emerging with China—perhaps a Taiwan Strait crisis that unfortunately trips into a conflict, or the U.S. having to come to the defense of an ally like the Philippines or Japan or Australia, what have you. Um, and so, because the U.S. feels its strategic posture—not just its nuclear weapons, but the policies and capabilities that it would use to project forward and defend allies in either Europe or Asia—because it would be so strained in that type of circumstance, um, many have advocated that the United States needs to think more about its reliance on nuclear weapons in that sort of second contingency, in this case with China.

I guess I’m curious, from your perspective, how much does this idea of multiple conflicts at the same time—how much is that feeding into China’s thinking, at least over the course of your research for this book? Because I do think that this is another understudied aspect of how China may be thinking about its posture towards the United States in a limited war scenario. Um, but the idea that a U.S. that may have been involved in a high-end conventional conflict, or even a nuclear conflict, over Europe is then asked to compete in a crisis that evolves into a conflict in Asia—um, you know, a bloodied U.S. may be thinking about its policies regarding nuclear first use very differently. And I’m wondering how much you’ve seen of that in—whether it’s original sources or interviews with Chinese interlocutors—that they’ve thought about that problem that Washington is trying to grapple with.

Fiona Cunningham:

So, I can say, at the very least anecdotally—um, and my fellow panelists may have a different take on this—but I generally see most Chinese analysts reject this kind of “three-body problem” framing, saying that this is how the United States thinks about it, but the idea that the two countries are going to team up and fight a conflict against the United States, or alternatively that they’re going to somehow take the opportunity posed by a weakened United States after a significant conventional conflict with Russia to achieve their aims, is just sort of unthinkable from the PRC perspective.

And so, as a result of that, if you put that into the arms control and nuclear context, um, a lot of Chinese analysts will sort of say, “Well, you know, this three-body problem—the idea from the United States that it needs nuclear forces to deal with both of these contingencies—is also invalid and is not something that they accept as a reasonable first principle to govern the nature of the nuclear relationship.” Um, I think that this puts the United States in a very difficult position when it thinks about how it’s going to set up its nuclear relationships going forward—um, both from, you know, if you are to think about what’s desirable in terms of control.

Um, it creates difficulties if China says it’s invalid that you have nuclear weapons that can deal with both of these contingencies, um, because that’s going to mean China won’t accept any sort of an asymmetric force—sort of asymmetric limits or asymmetric arsenals—perhaps more broadly. Um, but then that leads you pretty much straight into a sort of arms race. And I’ll just add one other piece that I think comes out with this, which is that right now, I think a lot of Chinese analysts are looking at what’s happening with the imminent expiration of the New START treaty next year, and they’re basically assuming that the United States is going to end up deploying more strategic warheads as a result of that change—uh, because of China’s nuclear modernization—and are saying that, as a result of that, China needs more nuclear weapons.

And so, at this point, it then starts to become hard to say, like, where—who’s responsible? Who started off all of this? You really start to get into that action-reaction spiral where China saying it needs more nuclear weapons is directly related to an anticipation of how the U.S. is going to proceed with arms control with Russia, uh, based on a set of political calculations that at least parts of its community are rejecting. So, I think it’s a very complex future, and unfortunately, I don’t have a lot of positive thoughts on how to solve it.

Pranav Vadhyar:

No, and I think, you know, one of the challenges the U.S. faces—it’s had this nuclear strategy through the Cold War that’s overwhelmingly relied on being able to limit damage from Russian nuclear forces, and it’s unclear that that mindset really applies to China, given the way that they think about nuclear weapons and strategic capabilities, period, is very different. But how do you wire the U.S. to have two nuclear strategies dependent on different adversaries? I think that’s a challenge that the strategic community is dealing with right now. Uh, Tong, anything you’d like to add on this question?

Tong Zhao:

Um, sure. In addition to what Fiona already said, I think China basically, you know, has a very different threat perception. It doesn’t see itself as being aggressive—even teaming up with Russia in a planned joint nuclear aggression against the United States. Its perception is the U.S. has been more hostile and aggressive. Um, so if U.S. conventional forces are stretched thin because of the two-theater dilemma, it would only make the U.S. less aggressive. So that’s stabilizing.

And yes, that will also put pressure on the United States to rely more on nuclear weapons in the second theater near China. That’s, I think, partially why China is strengthening its nuclear capabilities—from lower-end nuclear weapons all the way to higher-end capabilities—to deter the U.S. from becoming more interested in threatening nuclear escalation. Um, I think the real risk here is the longer-term arms race implications.

So far, the U.S., you know, is already on the verge of seriously considering enhancing U.S. nuclear capabilities—reversing decades of nuclear reduction—primarily, or at least partially, in response to China’s nuclear buildup. But China somehow—I haven’t gotten the sense of concern, a sense of urgency, in the Chinese expert community that, you know, “This will harm Chinese interests; we need to do something to make the United States change policy or not overreact.” Um, so it’s—I don’t know how to explain that, you know. Um, maybe China becomes more confident.

In other words, studying China’s nuclear thinking—I’m not sure if Fiona also gets the same feeling—I don’t see anything unique in China’s thinking that would definitely rule out the type of U.S. nuclear policy or options from China’s future interest, right? If China, indeed, its economic power continues growing, its resources becoming more available, all the U.S. options in damage limitation and managing escalation—nothing prevents China from becoming interested in those options. So maybe this is a time to reflect in general on those options, and when the United States still has a clear advantage, setting rules, promoting certain norms—I think that could be quite helpful in terms of risk reduction in the future.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks for that. Um, Mallerie, anything you want to comment on this, but also I want to dive into this risk reduction topic that’s come up a few times, given your last job in government—and particularly in the last year of the Biden administration, where we saw a few things happen that were positive on the U.S.-China discussion front, between the AI statement on NC3 as well as exchange of notifications related to ballistic missile launches. But anything you’d like to share on this question, and then please lead us off on your perspectives on U.S.-China arms control discussions during your time in government?

Mallerie Stewart:

Yeah, thank you, Pranav. I think it actually stems from Tong’s point quite well—that there is a fundamental divide in appreciation, as Fiona pointed out in her book. Um, and Tong mentioned that the Chinese feel that they have been the non-aggressive partner in this relationship, and the U.S. will be talking about a “three-body problem” that China doesn’t take seriously because they don’t see that as a potential option on the horizon—just looking at all of their policies, as Fiona did a deep dive on.

And I think that is one of the largest risks we face: this fundamental disconnect. On one side, the U.S. is assuming that this “limitless partnership” between China and Russia actually means a three-body problem—actually means that China and Russia will gang up on the U.S. if situations allow that, or if the Chinese and Russians feel that’s in their interest. Um, from the Chinese perspective, you know, I don’t know if the “limitless partnership” was just for show, but it’s the kind of thing where it does not seem to reflect their concern that they’re in this powerful role or in a more secure aggressor position with that partnership in place.

And I think that plays right into a risk reduction challenge where the two sides do not understand how they’re looking at the same problem set. There’s a complete divergence of appreciation for several aspects of risk reduction. But, you know, in the context of who’s the aggressor and who is trying to maintain the peace, it’s a complete diametrically opposite position.

But another example of that is, you know, the perception that when the U.S. was striving to do arms control, striving to do risk reduction with China during the previous administration, there was a perception from China that it was an attempt to limit China—to hold them back into this subordinate position, potentially of a lower nuclear arsenal, fewer weapons, a feeling of not as much conventional capability. Um, and one of the aspects of that was the U.S. insistence—or push—for transparency, right? There’s the irony of this transparency concept: as the U.S. thought it was stabilizing, as the U.S. said, “Here is our arsenal, here is our transparent policy, this should stabilize the response from those countries that are watching us as aggressors,” China responded quite negatively and saw that transparency as aggressive—as an effort at deterrence by highlighting how many weapons the U.S. had, how much power it had. It was almost as if the effort of transparency that the U.S. really strived for—which we thought the international community would appreciate—backfired, in a sense, by China stepping back and saying, “This is very aggressive to us; this makes us feel less secure, and thus we will not engage in these conversations.”

Um, as Pranav pointed out, we were able to achieve some success with China after we had one—and only—engagement with them on risk reduction in November of 2023. We asked them for several things, and at the table, of course, nothing was necessarily accomplished or agreed to. But subsequently, we saw some movement in those directions. And one of them being the first missile launch notification of their ballistic missile launch over the Pacific—the first notification of this type of missile launch in over 44 years. Um, and that was one of the things we had discussed in our risk reduction dialogue: this would be useful to notify each other so that we understand these are tests; these are not intended to be directly escalatory.

Another request was for keeping a human in the loop in the nuclear decision-making arena—trying to come to some consensus on the risks inherent in AI participation in strategic decision-making. Um, and again, at the table, it wasn’t agreed to, and subsequently, at the end of the previous administration, there was a very big agreement between the leaders of China and the United States to actually preserve human decision-making capacity in this nuclear decision-making loop. So those are two things.

A third thing we talked about at the table during our arms control conversation was greater military-to-military engagement to prevent low-level misunderstanding and miscalculation. And we saw, over the course of 2024, a ramp-up in those types of military-to-military engagements. Um, you know, a third thing we asked for was greater engagement on perceived space threats that we all faced, regardless of geopolitical position. Um, and it would be a continuation of space security dialogues that had continued from the Obama administration up through Trump 1, and then had stopped during the first Trump administration. And so, a request for a continuation of those—also a request for more discussion of chemical and biological risks that we faced. Um, and those were two angles that actually the Chinese government was open to, at least understanding where we could discuss mutual perceptions of threat in those arenas.

And I think that would have been—and it’s something that I think should still be pushed on—because it’s in both countries’ interest to understand our mutual perception. So, the risk reduction angle was not immediately accepted at the table, I think, because we come at arms control from opposite sides. Um, at least before that November 2023 conversation, the Chinese government’s perception was that we wanted to use arms control to control them and prevent their weapons development. The U.S. perception is the arms control effort was more to prevent unnecessary risks of misunderstanding, miscalculation, and unintentional escalation.

So, um, we came at the conversation from different sides—from very much a lack of trust on both sides. And I think, as we rolled forward in 2024, we were able to see some of the communications be more effective. And that’s why there was a change, both in the performance of the U.S. side and some of the performance on the Chinese side, to result in the three changed behaviors that we discussed.

So, what I would take from Fiona’s excellent book is that having an appreciation for all sides’ efforts to control escalation—to understand how escalation can be managed—would be a useful lead-in to risk reduction. Not a lead-in of “we must control this weapons program or that weapons program,” or “we must cap you here and you here,” but more of a recognition that escalation management, unintentional escalation prevention, is in all countries’ interests. And if that can be the means for the conversation—not that we’re going to end our leverage points and our escalation dynamics in one fell swoop—but that there should be some capacity to say, “We want to avoid this, you want to avoid this; let’s figure out, at a very basic, fundamental level, where our cultural divides are preventing us from achieving a standard level of a meeting of the minds as to where it’s in our mutual interest not to misunderstand each other,” if that makes sense.

So, there’s a risk reduction element that’s inherent in Fiona’s book, I think—showing there’s a desire to manage escalation. And yet, we were not able to capitalize on that in a very fulsome way in the previous administration. I hope, from studying this book, we will be able to capture it more fully as this administration goes forward with China.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks, Mallerie. Um, Tong, if it were up to you—if you could put a few topics on the table for a risk reduction conversation from a U.S. perspective—what do you think those topics would be? And I think one thing we’ve observed over the course of the Biden administration was—unless this was orchestrated perfectly in both systems, where it got to a head-of-state-level agreement on what we should all be working on—it was unlikely to result in a really fruitful conversation at lower levels of government. So, any ideas that you’d like to convey? I’m sure someone from the new administration is watching us on YouTube.

Tong Zhao:

Yes, and that’s actually a central recommendation from Fiona’s book. Uh, she points out that, you know, this competition going forward is going to be increasingly about manipulating risk—at the same time, trying to manage unintended risks, right? But you still need to intentionally create the right level of risk; it’s central to deterrence effectiveness. So, there is a limit to which cooperative measures can minimize risk.

Um, and that’s why I think, you know, Fiona’s book points out—I think it’s the number one recommendation in the list—which is: we still need to work on the political disagreements, disputes, problems between the two countries. You have to reduce their interest in manipulating risk in the first place. Um, that’s a very important effort that people often ignore or dismiss.

Um, but as China becomes more rich in terms of resources and expertise and human capital, it will have greater access to more tools. Um, and it will increasingly develop a more symmetric capability to the United States. Um, there is always room to engage with China and help China understand—or jointly understand—what’s the best practice when it comes to new capabilities and postures, right?

China is making significant departures from its traditional nuclear operational strategy. It’s increasingly stressed addressing rapid-response capability, including—it’s interesting—launch-under-attack capability. If adopted, I think that will represent a major transformation in China’s nuclear posture and will introduce, perhaps, the greatest risk of unintended nuclear conflict—especially for a country that is relatively new to the game of relying on early-warning satellites, ground-based radars, and quickly assessing the scale of an enemy’s incoming attack and the intent behind it, and to quickly come up with a strategy to react in a 10- or 20-minute timeframe. And perhaps the increasingly felt need to use AI and other advanced technologies to accelerate and facilitate this decision-making under a suppressed timeframe—um, the risk of technology, of human error, or unknown unknowns in all these new systems and postures are something that I think both sides have an interest in minimizing.

Um, so the U.S. has more experience. It could, you know, share some of the best practices—the principles, not the operational details; those are certainly classified and very sensitive. But I think there are still ways for the U.S. to share best practices at the general level—high-level principles. Um, and they can at least minimize the risks that neither side wants.

Pranav Vadhyar:

I guess Fiona, you can have the last word on this, then we’ll go to audience Q&A. But I guess one question that came to mind in discussing risk reduction—you, in this book, talk about this sort of political imperative to ratify the Test Ban Treaty, all while still dealing with the Taiwan Strait Crisis that crossed ‘95 into 1996. Um, do you see that sort of desire to be seen as upholding international norms in the nonproliferation arena—obviously, the increasing confidence, perhaps, as China brings new nuclear capabilities and other strategic capabilities online—as maybe allowing for some of these more fruitful and open discussions to take place? Because historically, China has used ambiguity, or even opacity, as a reason not to engage in what we, in the U.S. government—at least in our former jobs—consider the kind of way that you do arms control or the way that you talk about risk reduction.

Fiona Cunningham:

Um, so I think I’ll just say one thing about the multilateral context and one about the U.S.-China piece of this. I think if China were the only country that viewed itself as modernizing its nuclear arsenal, then the pressure to be seen as upholding norms and upholding the nuclear security order would be much stronger. But China sees itself as one among a number of official nuclear-weapon states that are modernizing their arsenals right now. And so, in some ways, it’s sort of sharing the heat, if you like, for the modernization—uh, even if you might say that, you know, looking at the UK or the United States in comparison, these are a matter of replacement rather than the kinds of qualitative changes that I think Tong pointed to in his remarks.

Um, at the same time, though, midway through this year, China did put forward, in the NPT Review Conference preparatory conference structure, a multilateral “no first use” policy. This is a longstanding proposal that China has had on the diplomatic table, but with a little bit more detail than in previous years. And part of that, I think, was a desire to respond to the pressure on the nuclear-weapon states to show progress in their NPT commitments—to make good-faith efforts towards disarmament. Um, but the pressure, in some ways, is shared for China in moving forward in that kind of multilateral context.

I think in the U.S.-China context, you know, we often hear this adage of, “Well, China is building up its nuclear capabilities; when it reaches parity, then it’s going to talk to us.” Um, and I have hesitations about that expectation for two reasons. One of them is that I think, in some ways, it’s pretty optimistic about what China is going to do, even if it reaches very high levels of nuclear weapons. Um, as I point out in the book—and I think as is probably obvious to all of us on the panel and many of you in the audience as well—is that China tends to yoke progress on nuclear risk reduction, nuclear arms control, to the broader tenor of the political relationship. And so, if the political relationship is in bad shape, don’t expect China to engage in nuclear risk reduction—uh, not least nuclear arms control—even if it has the capabilities that put it in a solid position.

The second reason why I think the “parity and then negotiate” expectation could be misleading is because I don’t think that parity is actually a meaningful concept for strategic deterrence. Parity is a meaningful concept for gaining the political equality to be able to come to a negotiating table from a position of equality—as an equal. But in terms of strategic deterrence, you can gain just as much deterrence efficacy with a smaller or a larger arsenal as your adversary. So, parity is not necessary. You might want to have very high levels of retaliatory capability; you may want to have postures that enable you to do certain kinds of things. But parity itself is not the piece that gets you to a place where you feel comfortable that you have enough against your adversary.

Um, and so, I think I just draw a little caution on the “parity and then negotiate” piece in the U.S.-China relationship, because I think it’s a question of politics. Uh, and it is also a question—and just to jump off Mallerie’s comments as well—that China might not also choose the same content and form for risk reduction and arms control with the United States as the United States is used to from its relationship with Russia and the Soviet Union. And it needs time to sort of figure out how it can maybe get to some of the same places—in terms of, you know, for example, launch notification—but it’s going to do so tacitly, informally, without setting up a nuclear risk reduction and a formal agreement. And so, there needs to be, I think, a little bit of time for China to figure out, you know, whether it’s culturally, organizationally, in terms of its practices, what the form is and also what the content is to get us to a slightly less dangerous place.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks for that. And of course, Washington decision-makers are famously patient as it relates to nuclear issues these days, so—um, but we’ll take your advice on it.

==== Audience Q&A
Pranav Vadhyar:

Um, let’s go to audience Q&A. We’ve got about a half hour left here for the event. Um, I do have a couple of YouTube questions, but if I could start in the room—does anyone have any questions? We’ve got one over here and one over here.

Kirsten Azel:

Thank you. Thank you to all of you. My name is Kirsten Azel. I run a China-focused risk consultancy, and, uh, I would like to ask—mostly for Dr. Cunningham, but to all panelists—do you believe, just—this is off of your most recent comment at the end there—do you believe that the Party leadership does have confidence in its strategic capabilities now to assert strategic deterrence over the U.S., or when might it have that understanding? It’s within the context of this strategic substitution, so it would have to have confidence enough that it could do some traditional or conventional move with sufficient backup strategically. Has it reached that point yet? Thank you.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Do you want to kick us off, Fiona?

Fiona Cunningham:

Sure. Well, I’ll break it down into: What does China need to get coercive leverage in conventional conflicts, and what does China need for a robust retaliatory capability to deter nuclear attacks? These are sort of two components of what we might think strategic deterrence is doing.

Um, I think that as China’s conventional capabilities have evolved, it needs less leverage from whatever capabilities it’s going to choose to threaten escalation in a conflict. And so, I think the uncertain pillar of China’s strategic substitution is really the cyber pillar—the one where you start to see a little bit of questioning as to whether this is really going to give China the conflict-overturning outcomes that it has expected, despite the fact that it’s also engaged in the Volt Typhoon intrusions over the last two years that suggest this is still kind of the game plan.

Um, so it’s sort of difficult to tell if China thinks that it has enough capability to make a conflict sufficiently dangerous, sufficiently risky for the United States to hesitate about intervening, um, based on its assessment of how those three capabilities are going—and how much it needs to really sort of fill in for as its conventional capabilities have evolved. Um, but I don’t see signs that it’s running to the nuclear option to deal with problems with that substitution approach.

In the nuclear realm, I think it’s difficult to say—like, you will not get any Chinese expert to tell you, “This is what we’re aiming for, and this is what we think enough is enough”—both for the reasons of opacity that my co-panelists have mentioned, but also because it sees “how much is enough” as a moving target based on what the United States is doing—not just with its potential to increase the size of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, but also in the non-nuclear space. So, there is—Chinese analysts will often point to improvements in U.S. sensing capabilities to find China’s mobile missiles. There is also a “golden” proposal to increase the comprehensiveness of U.S. missile defense. And so, all of those changes outside of the nuclear domain also lift the threshold for China for “how much is enough.”

So, I think it’s certainly more confident than it was in the past, but whether it is confident that it has a comfortable margin for error to withstand any of the shocks that come from technological choices the U.S. might have going forward is a little bit trickier to say.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Tong or Mallerie, anything you’d like to add? Tong, come to you first.

Tong Zhao:

Um, I’m happy to add a comment because I think this is a very important question. And, um, it’s important because I don’t think China has clear thinking on this, right? If you look at—I fully agree with what Fiona has said in the book—but if you look at the major turning points after which China decided to double down on Information Age weapons development because of the felt or perceived need for coercive leverage, right? All these Chinese developments of Information Age weapons are driven by the leverage deficit, as called by Fiona.

But if you look at many of the crises—the turning points—those are not military crises exactly; those are political crises, right? The embassy bombing in Belgrade—that was just one incident, right? There was no military action-counteraction. Um, and as well as the 2022 Nancy Pelosi visit, after which, you know, Fiona said in the book, it might further prompt China to develop more future tools for coercive leverage. But again, that was a political crisis; there was no military action-counter-military action.

So, it’s unclear why China’s leaders concluded that with some new type of weapons, those crises would turn out differently, right? I’m like, if China had more precise conventional missiles or more or better counterspace weapons, China would be able to somehow influence those political crisis developments and lead to different results. So, I think it’s unclear in China’s thinking how, actually, the lack of political leverage and what military can translate into the desired practical leverage—that is never clear in the Chinese thinking. So that’s why it’s particularly hard to answer the question, “How much will be sufficient?”

Pranav Vadhyar:

A great point, Mallerie.

Mallerie Stewart:

Yeah, absolutely. I think there’s never a static moment in the arms racing of leverage, security feelings, deterrence. There’s always—sometimes a country may lag. In fact, I think the U.S. feels as if we may have lagged on our nuclear modernization or our nuclear deterrence angle, and thus we need to rush to catch up. Um, I think if any country feels too secure, there’s usually a backlash of, “Oh, well, all these other countries are building up their own leverage, building up their own capacities, responding to our potential perceived advantages with their own ability to protect and prevent the effectiveness of those advantages.”

So, it’s a constant, right? It’s a constant race; it’s a constant moving target. And so, I think that China is very aware right now of needing to fill in potential holes or to continue to strive to be able to protect itself and project power. And that’s why we see, again, the exponential increase of its nuclear arsenal, right? If it felt secure in its positioning, why would it feel the need to do that across the board? Why would it develop these strategic substitutions? Why would it look to continue a lot of the maneuvering it’s doing in various regions around the world if it felt comfortable in its positioning?

And I think most countries don’t feel comfortable for very long in this sort of geopolitical struggle at the strategic level. And so, even if there was a pause or a delay in some of these programs, I think, ultimately, there’s a constant feeling of, “What will the next leverage angle come from?”

Pranav Vadhyar:

That’s great. Thank you. Um, gentleman right here.

Lawrence Freeman:

Lawrence Freeman. I’m an independent consultant. I do work on geopolitical issues. Uh, in terms of recent developments—so President Trump, in his discussions on the Ukraine-Russia war, has said nuclear war is the worst thing we face—World War III. He’s said it pretty boldly, whether you agree with his analysis of the situation. So, he’s proposed, actually, a meeting for Russia, China, and the U.S. to discuss the reduction of nuclear weapons. Uh, first, how would you think China is going to respond to that?

Second of all, from the Chinese standpoint—if I understand it, I’m not the expert you are—they believe that their first effort was to achieve economic parity and development, and then now they’re putting money into expansion of the military capability in the PLA. Is it possible that China—even without Russia and the U.S., maybe on the Trump-Biden made China the enemy that built up our huge $1 trillion budget—Trump seems to be going in a different direction. Is it possible China and the U.S. could reach an agreement that escalation of nuclear war is not in their interest, and they each would rather spend the money making each one of their countries great again?

Pranav Vadhyar:

Uh, Fiona, why don’t you take the first crack at it?

Fiona Cunningham:

So, I’ll take the first crack. Um, I think—so, I mean, I’m recently returned from China, so I can perhaps say that comment was made while I was actually in Beijing. And I think people are very curious—they’re listening, they’re constantly looking out for these kinds of cues to see: Where are the opportunities for us to make progress on arms control? Where is the Trump administration’s attitude towards nuclear arms racing going to be?

On the one hand, we see expectations of continuity; we see people who could be considered China hawks in the administration. But on the other hand, they know that Trump is a dealmaker. Trump can be potentially quite unpredictable in the choices that he’s going to make, and that can generate these kinds of opportunities to really shake things up—and in a good way.

At the same time, though, they’re wary of, you know, how much stock should we put in these kinds of statements? For all of the reasons that I just stated, right—that the trends are pushing in both directions. And I think one of the other pieces of this is one of the first things the administration did was to announce that it was going to pursue a more comprehensive missile defense capability. And that really plays on one of China—and I should say Russia’s—worst nightmares when it comes to arms racing and the stability of their nuclear forces. So, you’re really seeing things pull in opposite directions.

Um, and I think, for China’s perspective—and the U.S. perspective as well—one of the issues is always going to be: How do we think of the priorities between managing nuclear risks and the risks of the use of nuclear war, and ensuring that our political objectives are protected? Right? Because nuclear weapons, you know, for both countries, do help them protect some of their most core and important political interests. And so, thinking about where those priorities are going to sit, I think, is one of the issues in the U.S.-China relationship—because thus far, I think the United States puts the risk of nuclear war as perhaps a greater concern than China sometimes does.

But China, I think, is certainly looking—at least diplomatically—where can they move next after the P5 statement in February of 2022 that “a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought”—a statement that Xi Jinping repeated with a number of different leaders, including President Biden. But really sort of thinking about where that agenda can go next, while at the same time not renouncing the buildup of their own forces to ensure that the nuclear weapons deliver that kind of security for their interests that they feel is essential.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Others?

Tong Zhao:

I’m happy to jump in. I, you know, I think from China’s perspective, militarily, it benefits China to prevent nuclear escalation because of growing Chinese conventional military advantage, at least in the Asia-Pacific theater. Um, so that’s why I think, partly, China has been promoting “no first use” agreements, etc.—because the United States now faces, I think, more pressure to consider threatening nuclear escalation in a future regional war with China.

Um, regarding Trump’s talk about China-Russia-U.S. nuclear denuclearization—um, I think the first message the Trump administration’s overall approach has sent to Beijing is: It’s a world going forward where the world is going to be increasingly led by the law of the jungle—it’s “might makes right.” Because the way the Trump administration so far has dealt with issues of the Ukraine war, dealt with allies, dealt with Russia—uh, you know, to Trump, what is really important is how much power you have, what your material capability is to make a difference, right? So that reinforces China’s belief that what really matters, eventually, is your material capability—um, and anything else can change.

Um, so I think that reinforces China’s commitment to long-term development—even greater military capability in general, including nuclear. Um, the second factor is, as Fiona mentioned, huge uncertainty with the Trump administration. Firstly, huge uncertainty after the Trump administration—we know that the Trump administration perhaps only lasts four years. Um, and what happens after that is hugely uncertain; it could be reversed quickly. Um, in that case, any nuclear arms control agreement with the Trump administration wouldn’t be sustainable. Um, so why would China seriously negotiate with the Trump administration?

Um, and secondly, the uncertainty within Trump’s administration, right? Trump is very different from the Trump administration. The DoD’s number one priority right now is to cut other programs but focus on the China threat. But Trump himself is sending a different message—it doesn’t necessarily see China as a threat; he talks about nuclear disarmament, a 50% defense budget cut. Um, so the internal debate and tension and inconsistency is huge. Um, so that, you know, encourages China to just wait out and see what really happens.

This also is true for all the major big items—like, you know, “Golden Dome.” It’s going to be so expensive and technologically challenging—I think China now has the confidence and patience to wait out and see what really materializes before becoming really concerned about the consequences and jumping into nuclear negotiating talks.

Uh, but I think the more positive scenario is if China thinks Trump personally is really interested in nuclear arms control and nuclear talks about nuclear weapons—uh, if Trump persistently presses this issue, um, I think that might get Chinese attention. And I think China is increasingly open to a bigger bargain with the Trump administration—including trade, economic, and maybe other core interests like Taiwan or the South China Sea. And if that increasingly appears possible, China might throw in nuclear arms control talks as a sweetener to get concessions on other core issues. In that sense, I see the greater possibility of a general discussion of nuclear weapon issues—uh, without any sense of urgency on the part of Beijing to push for concrete agreements.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks, Tong. I mean, it’s a good point—if the new administration is willing to expand the trade basket, if you will, to include military infrastructure in the region or exercises or those types of things that I think would have been considered taboo in the last administration, then maybe that entices this type of discussion. So, Mallerie, in your last job, you had a lot of experience trying to get Chinese diplomats to the table on many issues—including in multilateral fora like the P5, First Committee, etc. Um, we’ve got an NPT Preparatory Committee meeting coming up. Um, as Fiona outlined, a “no first use” political statement is one of the things that China will be advancing. Um, do you think we’ll see reflections on this proposal by the president for a trilateral architecture at the PrepCom? And if so, how do you think it will be discussed among some of your former colleagues who will be there in New York?

Mallerie Stewart:

Yeah, I mean, I think Tong is exactly right that there’s a lot of confusion right now as to what the focus of this administration will be. Um, I think there’s been some inconsistent messaging—there’s been, you know, certainly less focus on a rules-based international order, less focus on following traditional normative approaches to regulating AI or the space arena, right? We’ve seen this administration, I think, to a certain degree, change its approach to some of the normative and rules-based approaches that the previous administration took.

So, you know, Tong’s point that this is sort of a “might makes right” is a challenging perception, I think, for other countries to interpret—to understand if there’s a possibility to cooperate, or if it’s just now a sheer arms race or a sheer race to see who is the strongest. Um, that said, you’re exactly right, and I think we’ve reflected some of the confusing statements about where the president is himself versus, potentially, where some of his cabinet or where Congress is with respect to their approach to China.

Um, the president has repeatedly talked about denuclearization. We saw him say that several times in Davos and then continue to make mention of the massive amounts of money that we pour into our nuclear arsenal. Um, so that is potentially a good lead-in to a basis for a conversation on nuclear risk reduction. It’s potentially helpful in the NPT context.

But I think the overwhelming response right now—potentially, in the absence of clear-cut policies or clear-cut approaches—is confusion, right? I think that, at least some that I’ve spoken with internationally, are trying to interpret the very different messages that they’re hearing, that they’re seeing, that they’re viewing playing out amongst the Trump administration, but also amongst the U.S. government and its allies. So, I think there’s a lot of open questions.

But I certainly agree with you, Pranav, that if the aperture is opened as to what could be discussed—both on the part of China and understanding what they would be willing to discuss at the table, as well as from the Trump administration and from Russia—there is a potential to at least find some commonality between the three countries. And I think that’s where there could be some cause for hopeful outlooks. Um, but I think, right now, in the context of very many different narratives and messages, it’s very hard to see how you crystallize that into something that’s positive moving forward.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Great. And as students of history know, combining the pursuit of an impenetrable missile defense shield with an offer of strategic offensive arms reductions is not a new playbook. It is something that was tried once before—albeit in a very different time when China’s nuclear arsenal and strategic capabilities were much lesser than they are today.

Cyber Warfare in a Taiwan Contingency (YouTube Question)
Pranav Vadhyar:

Um, let’s go to the internet for a question. Um, and if others have questions in the audience, please get them prepared as we’re running out of time. Um, and it’s a cyber question, so, Fiona, I’ll come to you first. Uh, based on the PRC’s theory of escalation and information warfare, what role will cyber warfare play in a Taiwan contingency, and how can the U.S. and Taiwan prepare? And I think that this would be something that allies would want to prepare for as well.

Fiona Cunningham:

Um, so it is a question that I look at in the book—examining the PRC’s doctrine, organization, signaling, and capabilities, insofar as they’re observable in the cyber arena. But I think that there has long been an understanding within China that offensive cyber operations can have a certain type of psychological effect—a strategic effect—on decision-makers because they can create paralysis, chaos among an adversary’s society, and then shape adversary decision-makers’ responses.

In addition to that, one of the other key ways in which China’s doctrinal writings deal with large-scale offensive cyber operations is to describe how they can also be used to attack the command-and-control networks that allow an adversary’s military to piece together different parts of their systems—and hence reduce the effectiveness of the way that they can use information to fight the contemporary joint operations that we would expect the U.S. and its allies to be fighting if there were a Taiwan contingency.

So, you might translate that into thinking that you will have some sort of attempt to use offensive cyber operations to shape U.S. decision-making, delay U.S. responses early on in a conflict, and that you might see relatively similar types of operations also leveled at Taiwan. And if we look at some of China’s cyber behavior as well—so, recently, large-scale revelations of the Volt Typhoon intrusions into both U.S. as well as allied critical infrastructure—and the U.S. government believes that this is intended to shape or slow down a U.S. response if there is any crisis decision-making.

What I think is interesting, though, is that you see, as of 2015 onwards, a greater interest in China in thinking about what they call “managing serious cyberspace crises”—not using these capabilities in reckless and uncontrolled ways that are going to generate uncontrolled risks of escalation because of the way that those cyber operations are conducted. So, there’s that desire to keep things controlled. And so, that leads to the question of whether China would automatically go about attempting to disable all of the infrastructure that it has penetrated immediately, or whether it would be looking at a more tiered or graded effort to generate escalatory pressure in cyberspace.

I will say, this is the one force posture of China’s Information Age weapons where it doesn’t use a particular type of term about generating escalatory momentum that you see in both the conventional missile as well as the counterspace portions—that suggests to me that how exactly you generate this kind of tiered approach or controlled approach to escalation using cyber operations is either absent or is still under development within the PRC.

So, that’s sort of the manner of using these capabilities. I think, in terms of responses for the Taiwanese as well as the United States, uh, one of the most obvious things that you want to do—the U.S. now has a cyber doctrine that involves trying to disrupt these kinds of operations before they’re conducted. So, find the malware, get it out of your system, try and avoid it from getting back in there—so that you’ve essentially taken away China’s ability to engage in these attacks before they begin. And maybe they’ll continue to try to do it again through different types of accesses and options, um, but still, it’s about creating more friction and difficulty for the PRC in preparing in that manner.

Of course, some things will slip through the cracks. So the other piece there would be preparing to make sure that you can quickly get these networks back up and running if data is wiped on them or if they are in any way disabled.

I think that's probably particularly important from the Taiwanese perspective—working on the resilience piece but also, to the extent that is permissible, working with partners in their private sector.


If you look at what happened with the Ukraine conflict, that really blunted the Russian efforts to use cyber operations to change the course of the conflict. It put a lot of pressure on Ukrainian decision-makers. The assistance of the private sector and NATO countries made a big difference in preventing Russia from having that impact.

That's something the PLA has noticed and is watching closely to see what the future of cyber operations holds, particularly what kinds of preparations led to less Russian success and more Ukrainian and Allied success.

==== Opening Remarks and Introduction

James Acton:

Okay, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Uh, my name is James Acton. I'm co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program here at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Um, I just want to say welcome to you all for this afternoon's event. Um, I'm going to hand over in just a sec to our moderator, but I just want to say, firstly, a very warm congratulations to Fiona Cunningham, uh, who's here for the Carnegie launch of her book, Under the Nuclear Shadow. Uh, Fiona, in my mind, is one of the most brilliant and insightful commentators on China—on China's nuclear weapons and its other forms of strategic weapons. Um, Fiona wrote at least part of this book while she was a Stanton Fellow at Carnegie three or four years ago now. Was it pre-pandemic? It was during the pandemic—that was right. I remember because you spent some of the time in Australia, incredibly gamely getting up for Zooms at, like, 3:00 in the morning Australian time, um, because that was daytime over here. Um, it’s wonderful to see this book come out. It’s an incredibly insightful, fascinating read. Um, so I encourage everyone to go and buy copies outside and then to embarrass Fiona by asking her to sign them at the end of today’s talk.

Um, let me also hand over, first of all, to the moderator for today’s meeting, uh, Pranav Vadhyar. Uh, Pranav is another ex-Carnegie person who went on to bigger and better things afterwards. Specifically, before he joined Carnegie, uh, Pranav was in the State Department. Uh, recently, towards the end of the Biden administration, he was Senior Director on the National Security Council for arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation. Um, the fact that the Trump administration has not named a successor for him, in my mind, can only be because he did the job so well that there is literally nothing left to do on arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation. Uh, Pranav is currently affiliated with MIT, uh, where he is taking a very well-deserved intellectual break after exceptionally hard work on the National Security Council. So, Pranav, let me welcome you and your co-panelists to the stage and just say thank you very much to all of you for being here today. And Pranav will introduce everybody on the panel.

[Applause]

==== Moderator’s Introduction and Comments on Fiona’s Book
Pranav Vadhyar:

All right, um, well, thanks everyone for joining us, um, and thank you, James, for that kind introduction. Um, I want to introduce our panelists briefly, but first, let me just share a few thoughts on Fiona’s book—why I think it’s such an important contribution to our discourse and analysis. Um, as many people know, Washington is hotly debating what to do about China’s nuclear buildup. That crosses into arms control, nonproliferation, disarmament, nuclear posture, and nuclear policy conversations taking place in the government and outside. Um, some, like the Strategic Posture Commission, note that U.S. strategy should no longer consider China to be a lesser-included threat and are calling for an increase in the nuclear force in the United States, as well as the conventional forces.

Um, many officials have noted the significance of China’s buildup occurring right now, um, as the New START treaty is due to expire next year. Um, this creates added pressure for these conversations that are taking place within the U.S. government. Um, the discourse has tended to focus on the shifting strategic nuclear equation between the United States and Russia, the United States and China, and all three combined. And those numerical comparisons—trying to find the perfect number—are always going to occupy the debate that’s taking place here.

What Fiona’s book does, actually, is help us understand China’s strategic rationale. Um, this isn’t just a math problem. We need to understand China’s foreign policy goals, the dilemmas that Beijing has been responding to over the past couple of decades, um, and the relevance of nuclear deterrence, conventional deterrence, and Information Age capabilities to how they see the world and their near abroad. I think this book will be a really critical contribution. It’ll help educate U.S. policymakers, academics, and experts worldwide on understanding Chinese thinking on these issues today. And, most importantly, I think that for decision-makers who occupy the current administration here in the United States, as well as leadership in China and Russia, um, there are going to be tough decisions to make on arms control and future nuclear posture formulations. And so, this analysis is absolutely critical and timely.

Um, and Fiona, I just want to congratulate you for publishing this. I think you appropriately bring the focus on this limited war dilemma that has motivated so many of the changing characteristics of China’s nuclear buildup, as well as everything else they’re doing to advance strategic capabilities. Um, you highlight for readers where these important debates occurred within Beijing in a way that I don’t think we’ve been able to see in such a concise way in unclassified publications to date—and those critical moments throughout history where these debates occurred: the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the Belgrade bombing, reactions to U.S. policy statements, and nuclear posture reviews.

Um, and so I’m very happy to be here to moderate the panel. And without further ado, let me introduce our panelists and then turn it over to Fiona. Um, so I want to applaud Mallerie Stewart, seated furthest away from me, for joining as a discussant today. She was the Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability in the Biden administration, as well as my predecessor at the National Security Council. Um, and before that, she served as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Arms Control Bureau under the Obama administration and has served as a lawyer at the State Department Office of the Legal Adviser since 2002.

Uh, Tong Zhao is a Senior Fellow with the Nuclear Policy Program and Carnegie China, um, which is our—formerly Carnegie’s East Asia-based research center on contemporary China. He was formerly based in Beijing and now conducts his research in Washington on strategic security issues. Um, he’s long been an expert on Chinese nuclear thinking. He’s a great collaborator, and I welcome him to the panel as well.

Finally, Fiona Cunningham, a non-resident scholar here at the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment, as James introduced her previously. Uh, she’s made a contribution with this book, and I look forward to seeing her succeed and continue to advance the discourse on China’s nuclear issues.

With that, let me turn it over to Fiona and anything that you’d like to say up front about your book, and then we will move to moderated Q&A.

==== Fiona Cunningham’s Remarks on Under the Nuclear Shadow
Fiona Cunningham:

Super. Uh, so I want to start by thanking both Pranav and James for your warm congratulations, uh, as well as your welcome. Uh, it’s an honor to be in the company of my fellow panelists, Tong and Mallerie, as well. I’m very grateful to the Nuclear Policy Program for hosting this event. And as James alluded to, it’s very meaningful for me to be able to speak about my book here, given the fact that some of the key outstanding questions and lingering issues with this manuscript clicked into place while I was a Stanton Fellow here at Carnegie. So thank you to James, to Toby, to George, and to NPP colleagues, both past and present.

In my remarks, there are three things that I want to do. Uh, the first is that I’m going to introduce three big ideas in the book that I think make the case for why China’s approach to strategic deterrence is different. The second thing is I want to outline a little bit of how China’s approach has evolved over time. And then offer some thoughts on what the future holds for China’s strategic deterrence, building on the conclusion of the book but hopefully helping to launch our discussion as a panel.

So, there are three big ideas in this book. The first is this idea of a limited war dilemma, which is the problem at the core of the book; strategic substitution, which is the solution to that problem; and Information Age weapons, which implement that solution. And you can think of them as the “why,” “what,” and “how” of China’s distinctive approach to strategic deterrence.

So, the first idea is the limited war dilemma that Pranav briefly mentioned in his opening remarks. This book, I think, is about a central problem that all nuclear-armed states face when they’re confronting a nuclear-armed adversary: How can they still continue to use their military capabilities to achieve political objectives—to coerce their adversaries—without triggering what would be a catastrophic nuclear war? And I want to emphasize that no state has actually managed to solve this dilemma. We have two kinds of traditional options that most states have selected, which involve threatening the first use of nuclear weapons or threatening a decisive conventional victory against one’s opponents, which is backed by nuclear forces that would deter an adversary from overturning that victory by escalating to the nuclear level. And all of these options have their advantages and disadvantages. Neither of them is a silver bullet.

But this does raise the question of what happens when you have a country that is sensitive to the disadvantages of both of them. And that was China’s situation. It did not view nuclear threats against a nuclear-armed adversary as credible, and it was so conventionally inferior to the United States 25 years ago—when it began to grapple with this dilemma—that it would have been decades before it had really been able to select that conventional option. And so, it didn’t adopt either of these answers to the limited war dilemma.

And that leads to the second key idea of strategic substitution. And this is the third option that China created for coping with the limited war dilemma. At its core, strategic substitution involves threatening to use non-nuclear weapons to escalate a conflict that can have strategic effects and change the calculations of an adversary’s decision-maker, but pairing those non-nuclear strategic attacks with a retaliatory nuclear posture. And so, what that combination does is that it enables a state to increase the risk of escalation in a conflict—including up to the nuclear level—but without actually having to threaten to use its nuclear weapons first. In fact, it actually dares the adversary to be the first one to use nuclear weapons in response to these provocative non-nuclear attacks.

And strategic substitution was appealing to China because it offered quick and credible coercive leverage, in contrast to the decades that it would need to redress the conventional imbalance with the United States. Um, and it was preferable to the first use of nuclear weapons, which was a more difficult option to make credible.

The third big idea in the book is that of Information Age weapons, which I argue could be used as substitutes in this strategic substitution approach because they promise to provide coercive leverage against nuclear-armed adversaries. And by Information Age weapons, I’m talking about conventional missiles that are used in a precision-strike capacity, relying on information networks to be guided to their targets, as well as counterspace and offensive cyber operations that disrupt an adversary’s satellites and computer networks, respectively.

Some, but not all, of these weapons have the capacity to generate strategic effects because they can threaten large-scale damage against an adversary—its military, its society, its allies—that’s difficult to defend against. They cross key escalation thresholds in limited wars between nuclear powers. And perhaps most importantly, they share technology with nuclear weapons, so they’re entangled—if you like, to use James’s term—with nuclear weapons in ways that generate inadvertent nuclear escalation risks if you choose to use them.

But to generate coercive leverage, these weapons—you can’t just possess them. You actually have to posture your capabilities, as well as your doctrine, your organization, and even your signaling to an adversary, in ways that optimize those components to generate coercive leverage. And China pursued a large conventional precision missile force after the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait Crisis and counterspace weapons and offensive cyber operations after the United States accidentally bombed China’s embassy in Belgrade in 1999 during the Kosovo air war—an incident that China’s leaders to this day do not accept was an accident.

So, how has China’s approach to the use of these Information Age weapons evolved over time? I think three aspects are worth highlighting, although there’s more than that in the book—it’s many pages long. Um, first is that strategic substitution emerged from leverage deficits that China experienced because of crises with the United States over these two incidents I just mentioned: Taiwan and the Belgrade embassy bombing. And these crises alerted China’s leaders to the fact that if there was a future Taiwan crisis, they were going to either fight a war that they were going to lose, or they would have to make humiliating diplomatic concessions if they didn’t go about generating more coercive leverage and augmenting the military capabilities that they had in ways that would make crises in the future more dangerous and costly for U.S. leaders. But China’s choice of strategic substitution took place at a time when its nuclear and conventional capabilities were significantly weaker than they are today.

The second thing that’s worth pointing out about the evolution of these capabilities is that China’s coercive force postures for its three Information Age weapons evolved over time. After the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait Crisis, China sought a conventional missile force that was going to be large, precise, and could target U.S. bases in East Asia. But initially, it lacked the precision-strike capability—both in terms of accuracy and the sensors to support it—to be able to carefully calibrate escalation in the way it used its conventional missiles. The real turning point came around 2013 when it started to deploy more accurate missiles and better sensing capabilities. And here, you can think of the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile as kind of emblematic of that change. And after that point, PLA doctrinal writings about how China would use these capabilities started to shift from describing both military and civilian targets for these attacks to military-only ones.

China’s cyber force posture also evolved over time—from one that really exacerbated the risk of uncontrolled escalation (what I call a “brinkmanship posture”) to one that tried to tame them. And this occurred, I think, fairly abruptly between the years of 2012 and 2014, as China’s leaders decided to exert a lot more control and centralize the command structure for their cyber capabilities. But this shift is not a technological story. This is one, instead, about leaders feeling greater vulnerability to cyber attacks themselves because China rapidly digitized as a society, a military, and a government—and therefore that forced China’s leaders to really want to control the use of those capabilities more carefully.

The final point on the evolution is one of the reasons why China’s postures evolved is related to U.S. countermeasures. So, China’s conventional missile force, I think, is one of the biggest headaches for military planners here in Washington, as well as in the Indo-Pacific and in the region itself. But its leverage might actually end up being relatively fleeting as the United States shed the constraints of the INF Treaty and is seeking to counter China’s advantages by deploying similar capabilities in the region.

In the cyber domain, in the last eight years or so, the U.S. has also begun to rethink this problem—from being one of a “cyber Pearl Harbor” it would have to prepare for, to being really more like a “death by a thousand cuts” from lower-level cyber attacks under the threshold of armed conflict. So, in preparing for that different way of thinking about the effects of cyber challenges, this has robbed China of some of the coercive leverage it would otherwise have from threatening a “cyber Pearl Harbor,” but also has enabled the U.S. to develop tools and techniques to disrupt Chinese preparations for cyber attacks before they’re actually executed in peacetime.

In space, the United States is changing its satellite architecture from one based on big, juicy-target-type satellites to one that complements those satellites with ones that are of lower value and smaller—that blunts the leverage China could gain from any individual anti-satellite weapon. And China is also now concerned that the U.S. is developing the full suite of its own counterspace capabilities as well.

So, what does the future hold for China’s strategic substitution approach? I think, on the one hand, China’s Information Age weapons haven’t necessarily lived up to the promise that its leaders saw in them back 25 years ago when they started to develop them. And perhaps we can’t blame them because these were often relatively nascent technologies—nascent changes in the way that society was using some of them. Um, so they can be forgiven for overhype, perhaps, of the leverage they would get. But in other cases, China actually did succeed in gaining coercive leverage, only to see that blunted by U.S. countermeasures within that timeframe.

China’s nuclear and conventional capabilities have also improved out of sight in the past decade, which is going to make any of those traditional options a little bit more appealing than they were in 1995. But on the other hand, I think it’s worth pointing out some limits to those modernization campaigns. China’s conventional capabilities, I don’t think, yet can threaten a decisive victory in a Taiwan contingency in which the United States intervenes. It may be much more of a kind of stalemate, or no clear winner. And there’s a pretty high bar that states need for their conventional capabilities to really rely upon them for coercive leverage.

I also—perhaps more controversially—don’t see China’s nuclear modernization as evidence that it is seeking a first-use nuclear strategy that spells the end of strategic substitution. Yes, that modernization is going to enable China to make more credible threats of first use because it’s a larger force, it has better theater forces, and sits at a higher state of readiness. But I do ask: Where are the tactical nuclear weapons with nuclear armaments for China? Why hasn’t it changed its “no first use” policy if it really wants to get the maximum out of a first-use posture? Where is the evidence of an operational doctrine for the first use of nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict? And is there evidence that China now has more confidence that threatening nuclear first use against a nuclear-armed adversary would be credible—which is precisely the calculation, or the doubts, that China’s leaders previously had that pushed them towards strategic substitution?

There’s ongoing ambiguity over China’s motivations for its nuclear modernization, but I’m relatively convinced that both U.S. capabilities and strategy, as well as the pursuit of political effects that having a bigger and better arsenal might have on U.S. decision-making—as some of Tong’s work has shown, especially in a Taiwan contingency—are key reasons for it. But thus far, I think that China’s nuclear buildup is actually responding to different problems than a search for coercive leverage. So, although China might have a better grip on the limits of strategic substitution, it still doesn’t appear to have found a better option. I’ll leave it there.

==== Moderated Discussion: Limited War Scenarios and Escalation Risks
Pranav Vadhyar:

Great, thanks for that, Fiona. Um, so I will take the privilege of being moderator to ask a few questions, and then we will come to the audience, both here and watching on YouTube. Um, so, uh, I guess my first couple of questions, Fiona, I’ll start with you, then I would appreciate Tong and Mallerie weighing in too.

First, I was wondering if you could kind of walk us through one of these limited war scenarios—and it can involve fictional countries if you wish. Um, you know, I’m trying to better understand what about China’s approach to strategic deterrence, including these Information Age capabilities, um, do you find will make U.S. decisions to escalate or not more difficult? Um, there’s a certain amount of ambiguity that comes with using these Information Age capabilities, but they also run the risk of, you know, incidentally striking what the U.S. considers to be a strategic asset or a vital interest, depending on the type of capability used and depending on the type of target it’s used against. So, imagine counterspace attacks or attacks against allied cyber infrastructure. Um, what do you see in this approach that makes that decision-making here in Washington very fuzzy?

And then, I guess, relatedly, um, what are the biggest risks of the PRC’s approach to intent and escalation?

Fiona Cunningham:

So, I think what makes this calculation, in some ways, difficult for Washington is that the way China thinks about deploying some of these capabilities—and you see this described in the doctrine—um, that, for example, China would engage in large-scale cyber attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure on the homeland, um, or that it might think about attacking counterspace assets, some of which are in lower orbits, which may be particularly important for the way that the U.S. thinks about its conventional strike capabilities. You see a little bit less about China basically thinking about attacking assets that are specifically designed to limit the U.S.’s use of its own nuclear weapons—so its NC3 assets, for example—although it certainly is starting to, I believe, develop capabilities that would enable it to target those systems as well.

And I think what’s difficult, uh, or what the underlying piece of China’s thinking about strategic substitution is here, um, is that there’s still a decision that has to be made by a country to respond to these provocative attacks—to use nuclear weapons first or to initiate nuclear threats. And the gamble, in some ways, of strategic substitution is actually that there’s a bluff: an adversary is not going to be willing to fight a nuclear war for whatever it is that’s at stake in the Indo-Pacific. Um, and so, if you attack these kinds of assets, it’s going to be very provocative, um, but it is not going to necessarily generate the response of an adversary using its nuclear weapons first.

So, China is trying to essentially drive the U.S. right up to that nuclear threshold but get it to be the one that backs down because it’s not willing to cross that bright line and use nuclear weapons first—or even start to initiate nuclear threats. So, the fuzzy decision-making, I think, for Washington in this situation is—I mean, how many of these high-value assets do you absorb damage to? Are there other ways in which you can deter them than threaten the first use of nuclear weapons? Um, you know, what stakes are actually at play in an Indo-Pacific conflict, and how are they going to change over the course of a conflict if a country like China is starting to erode some of these key aspects of U.S. military power—if it’s attacking bases in allied countries, if it’s engaging in the use of force against the U.S. homeland, even with these non-kinetic strikes? That, in and of itself, can sort of change the stakes of a conflict as well, from being just about, let’s say, the defense of Taiwan to ones where it really starts to become about responses to the damage that China is inflicting throughout the course of a conflict.

So, I see that as kind of the dilemma that China is thinking through. Obviously, the use of some of these capabilities can also damage U.S. nuclear-supporting assets. Uh, China itself doesn’t have a counterforce doctrine, as is my understanding, and so they might look at that and say, “Well, you can’t say just because we have offensive cyber operations or because we have counterspace weapons that the design here is actually to diminish your ability to use nuclear weapons first.” But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the U.S. isn’t going to look at weapons that can be retargeted, weapons where you can’t necessarily observe what it is that they’re targeting, or, in the case of cyber operations, even see where your assets have been compromised—and be able to react in a relatively measured manner.

Um, so I think the real question for the U.S. and its allies in thinking about how to respond to strategic substitution is how to avoid sort of taking the bait of thinking of this as a nuclear escalation scenario and finding ways to fight through these provocative attacks, uh, without diminishing their ability to fight conventional operations, but also without escalating to the nuclear level—because then the logic of strategic substitution starts to fall flat, because China has to come up with a Plan B if these attacks don’t have the intended effect.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks for that. Tong, anything you’d like to add?

Tong Zhao:

Um, sure. You know, I think this research really helps us trace the evolution of China’s strategic security thinking. I think Fiona, you know, is among one of the first scholars to actually do the cutting-edge research—look at China’s traditional thinking on escalation, which is: China generally dismisses the risk of crossing the nuclear threshold and dismisses the possibility of managing escalation once the nuclear threshold is crossed. Um, and then her most recent research, uh, reflects, I think, increasing Chinese interest over the past couple of decades, at least, in becoming more interested in understanding escalation dynamics and managing escalation.

This limited war dilemma, I think, reflects China’s deeper thinking on managing military escalation. Um, and the Chinese solution, as Fiona identified, reflects a general strategy. I think there is actually some similarity between the Chinese and Western approaches, which is: you want to give yourself more options, more freedom, more flexibility. So, you add more rungs to the escalation ladder—you add more tools that allow you to respond in various scales or intensities to different levels of conflict. So, you’ll see China starting with, you know, nuclear-level deterrence capability and then prioritizing non-nuclear strategic weapons—or Information Age weapons—and then, when China’s money and resources allow, China focuses more on the lower end: the general-purpose conventional capabilities. So now it has full-spectrum flexibility.

Um, and I think that’s not that dissimilar to the Western approach, which means managing escalation—including conventional all the way to all-out nuclear war—is going to be more important in China-U.S. or China-West military competition. I think this research definitely helps us really understand that dynamic much better. Um, I think when both sides—U.S. and China—now think about escalating, managing escalation, um, it certainly gives us both challenges and opportunities. Opportunities in the sense that we both understand the risk of uncontrolled escalation, as Fiona identified. Uh, initially, Chinese weapons were not good enough, so China couldn’t really control the escalation risk, but over time, China becomes both more capable and also more willing to tailor the escalation risk.

Uh, so the challenge becomes: How do we reach basic understandings of what certain actions are more escalatory or less escalatory? What are the other’s escalation thresholds or red lines? I think that offers opportunities for more in-depth discussions. Um, but on the other hand, when both sides are now more committed to managing escalation—increasing one’s own advantage in managing escalation—that also drives new arms race dynamics. So, um, I think this is, you know, that’s why I think everyone will really need to read Fiona’s book to understand what future U.S.-China competition is going to look like.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Yeah, it goes without saying: read and cite the book. Um, we’re all going to be doing that, I think, in the coming months. Mallerie, anything you want to chime in on this topic?

Mallerie Stewart:

Yeah, I mean, I completely agree with what has been said, and especially the fact that Fiona has taken an issue that really did need investigation and looked at primary sources—looked at policy that hasn’t been looked at comprehensively by the U.S. government or U.S. commentators ever. And I think that was really important and something that we need to focus on going forward.

Um, what I sort of take from the question, Pranav, was sort of the risks involved in some of these efforts to manage escalation—some of these efforts to use strategic substitution to avoid, potentially, a nuclear conflict from being the automatic outcome of spiraling conflicts. And I think, you know, one of the risks is an overreliance on the effort to understand escalation. And I think Fiona points that out quite well: with these strategic substitutions, there’s an assumption that China sort of takes on—that it can push the U.S. to the edge, not force them over the nuclear precipice, and not force them to use a nuclear response to a non-nuclear challenge. But there’s an assumption that, “Yes, we can use cyber weapons, we can use precision strike and our space weapon capability to leverage the U.S. in a way that will prevent a nuclear war but will also make them feel vulnerable to our persuasion.”

And I think the risk there is that escalation management and escalation dynamics are constantly in flux, right? And your point, that I think is very well conveyed in the book, is there’s an arms race in strategic substitution. There’s an arms race in escalation management. There’s constantly a desire to minimize the leverage of potential adversaries through these alternative options. And so, we see the massive proliferation of space architectures with numerous satellites to defeat a potential direct-ascent destructive ASAT capacity that China has demonstrated. We see the U.S. building up cyber defenses and trying to, in the arms race of the cyber arena, always stay a step ahead with respect to defenses.

And I think the challenge is when a country so focuses on managing escalation dynamics without the equivalent reliance on understanding the other side’s response, understanding the other side’s engagement—or the point you also make very well: the entanglement challenge, right? If we don’t know if this satellite is purely for conventional purposes or has a nuclear C3 element to it, can we truly say that targeting that satellite will not cross a threshold that we did not anticipate in advance?

I think that is why—and your book concludes, and I’m not going to give any spoilers—but I think it does make a really good point that our arms control efforts, our risk reduction efforts, have to evolve to take into account the escalatory management challenge that China has now gotten its head around and thinks, perhaps, that it’s really understanding, in an arena which is very challenging to understand, right? Because there is no really fulsome, direct government-to-government engagement. And I think that is a risk that is implied, if not directly, in your book—that needs to be more comprehensively addressed by both governments going forward.

Pranav Vadhyar:

And Mallerie, you will be the lead-off hitter on a risk reduction question that is coming up, so we can dive into that a little bit more.

==== Discussion on Multiple Conflicts and Risk Reduction
Pranav Vadhyar:

One thing I want to touch upon, though, that all three of you have pointed to but not said directly is—um, all of this, this book is being published and is available for people to read now. Um, everything that’s happening in the U.S. government—I mean, all of this is happening in the context of the United States, China, Russia, many of our European allies, many of our Asian allies, seeing the risk of limited war between nuclear powers as increasing, right? I mean, it’s not—I’m not being scientific about it; I’m just stating what I think is obvious and something that the Chinese detected in the early ‘90s. And as a result—thanks to your research, Fiona—you’ve helped explain why they’ve made certain investments and developed certain capabilities all the way through to today.

Um, but, you know, from a U.S. perspective, the United States is looking at the possibility that conflict could emerge in Europe with Russia, um, for example, and then, either at the same time or in the near aftermath, having to potentially deal with conflict emerging with China—perhaps a Taiwan Strait crisis that unfortunately trips into a conflict, or the U.S. having to come to the defense of an ally like the Philippines or Japan or Australia, what have you. Um, and so, because the U.S. feels its strategic posture—not just its nuclear weapons, but the policies and capabilities that it would use to project forward and defend allies in either Europe or Asia—because it would be so strained in that type of circumstance, um, many have advocated that the United States needs to think more about its reliance on nuclear weapons in that sort of second contingency, in this case with China.

I guess I’m curious, from your perspective, how much does this idea of multiple conflicts at the same time—how much is that feeding into China’s thinking, at least over the course of your research for this book? Because I do think that this is another understudied aspect of how China may be thinking about its posture towards the United States in a limited war scenario. Um, but the idea that a U.S. that may have been involved in a high-end conventional conflict, or even a nuclear conflict, over Europe is then asked to compete in a crisis that evolves into a conflict in Asia—um, you know, a bloodied U.S. may be thinking about its policies regarding nuclear first use very differently. And I’m wondering how much you’ve seen of that in—whether it’s original sources or interviews with Chinese interlocutors—that they’ve thought about that problem that Washington is trying to grapple with.

Fiona Cunningham:

So, I can say, at the very least anecdotally—um, and my fellow panelists may have a different take on this—but I generally see most Chinese analysts reject this kind of “three-body problem” framing, saying that this is how the United States thinks about it, but the idea that the two countries are going to team up and fight a conflict against the United States, or alternatively that they’re going to somehow take the opportunity posed by a weakened United States after a significant conventional conflict with Russia to achieve their aims, is just sort of unthinkable from the PRC perspective.

And so, as a result of that, if you put that into the arms control and nuclear context, um, a lot of Chinese analysts will sort of say, “Well, you know, this three-body problem—the idea from the United States that it needs nuclear forces to deal with both of these contingencies—is also invalid and is not something that they accept as a reasonable first principle to govern the nature of the nuclear relationship.” Um, I think that this puts the United States in a very difficult position when it thinks about how it’s going to set up its nuclear relationships going forward—um, both from, you know, if you are to think about what’s desirable in terms of control.

Um, it creates difficulties if China says it’s invalid that you have nuclear weapons that can deal with both of these contingencies, um, because that’s going to mean China won’t accept any sort of an asymmetric force—sort of asymmetric limits or asymmetric arsenals—perhaps more broadly. Um, but then that leads you pretty much straight into a sort of arms race. And I’ll just add one other piece that I think comes out with this, which is that right now, I think a lot of Chinese analysts are looking at what’s happening with the imminent expiration of the New START treaty next year, and they’re basically assuming that the United States is going to end up deploying more strategic warheads as a result of that change—uh, because of China’s nuclear modernization—and are saying that, as a result of that, China needs more nuclear weapons.

And so, at this point, it then starts to become hard to say, like, where—who’s responsible? Who started off all of this? You really start to get into that action-reaction spiral where China saying it needs more nuclear weapons is directly related to an anticipation of how the U.S. is going to proceed with arms control with Russia, uh, based on a set of political calculations that at least parts of its community are rejecting. So, I think it’s a very complex future, and unfortunately, I don’t have a lot of positive thoughts on how to solve it.

Pranav Vadhyar:

No, and I think, you know, one of the challenges the U.S. faces—it’s had this nuclear strategy through the Cold War that’s overwhelmingly relied on being able to limit damage from Russian nuclear forces, and it’s unclear that that mindset really applies to China, given the way that they think about nuclear weapons and strategic capabilities, period, is very different. But how do you wire the U.S. to have two nuclear strategies dependent on different adversaries? I think that’s a challenge that the strategic community is dealing with right now. Uh, Tong, anything you’d like to add on this question?

Tong Zhao:

Um, sure. In addition to what Fiona already said, I think China basically, you know, has a very different threat perception. It doesn’t see itself as being aggressive—even teaming up with Russia in a planned joint nuclear aggression against the United States. Its perception is the U.S. has been more hostile and aggressive. Um, so if U.S. conventional forces are stretched thin because of the two-theater dilemma, it would only make the U.S. less aggressive. So that’s stabilizing.

And yes, that will also put pressure on the United States to rely more on nuclear weapons in the second theater near China. That’s, I think, partially why China is strengthening its nuclear capabilities—from lower-end nuclear weapons all the way to higher-end capabilities—to deter the U.S. from becoming more interested in threatening nuclear escalation. Um, I think the real risk here is the longer-term arms race implications.

So far, the U.S., you know, is already on the verge of seriously considering enhancing U.S. nuclear capabilities—reversing decades of nuclear reduction—primarily, or at least partially, in response to China’s nuclear buildup. But China somehow—I haven’t gotten the sense of concern, a sense of urgency, in the Chinese expert community that, you know, “This will harm Chinese interests; we need to do something to make the United States change policy or not overreact.” Um, so it’s—I don’t know how to explain that, you know. Um, maybe China becomes more confident.

In other words, studying China’s nuclear thinking—I’m not sure if Fiona also gets the same feeling—I don’t see anything unique in China’s thinking that would definitely rule out the type of U.S. nuclear policy or options from China’s future interest, right? If China, indeed, its economic power continues growing, its resources becoming more available, all the U.S. options in damage limitation and managing escalation—nothing prevents China from becoming interested in those options. So maybe this is a time to reflect in general on those options, and when the United States still has a clear advantage, setting rules, promoting certain norms—I think that could be quite helpful in terms of risk reduction in the future.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks for that. Um, Mallerie, anything you want to comment on this, but also I want to dive into this risk reduction topic that’s come up a few times, given your last job in government—and particularly in the last year of the Biden administration, where we saw a few things happen that were positive on the U.S.-China discussion front, between the AI statement on NC3 as well as exchange of notifications related to ballistic missile launches. But anything you’d like to share on this question, and then please lead us off on your perspectives on U.S.-China arms control discussions during your time in government?

Mallerie Stewart:

Yeah, thank you, Pranav. I think it actually stems from Tong’s point quite well—that there is a fundamental divide in appreciation, as Fiona pointed out in her book. Um, and Tong mentioned that the Chinese feel that they have been the non-aggressive partner in this relationship, and the U.S. will be talking about a “three-body problem” that China doesn’t take seriously because they don’t see that as a potential option on the horizon—just looking at all of their policies, as Fiona did a deep dive on.

And I think that is one of the largest risks we face: this fundamental disconnect. On one side, the U.S. is assuming that this “limitless partnership” between China and Russia actually means a three-body problem—actually means that China and Russia will gang up on the U.S. if situations allow that, or if the Chinese and Russians feel that’s in their interest. Um, from the Chinese perspective, you know, I don’t know if the “limitless partnership” was just for show, but it’s the kind of thing where it does not seem to reflect their concern that they’re in this powerful role or in a more secure aggressor position with that partnership in place.

And I think that plays right into a risk reduction challenge where the two sides do not understand how they’re looking at the same problem set. There’s a complete divergence of appreciation for several aspects of risk reduction. But, you know, in the context of who’s the aggressor and who is trying to maintain the peace, it’s a complete diametrically opposite position.

But another example of that is, you know, the perception that when the U.S. was striving to do arms control, striving to do risk reduction with China during the previous administration, there was a perception from China that it was an attempt to limit China—to hold them back into this subordinate position, potentially of a lower nuclear arsenal, fewer weapons, a feeling of not as much conventional capability. Um, and one of the aspects of that was the U.S. insistence—or push—for transparency, right? There’s the irony of this transparency concept: as the U.S. thought it was stabilizing, as the U.S. said, “Here is our arsenal, here is our transparent policy, this should stabilize the response from those countries that are watching us as aggressors,” China responded quite negatively and saw that transparency as aggressive—as an effort at deterrence by highlighting how many weapons the U.S. had, how much power it had. It was almost as if the effort of transparency that the U.S. really strived for—which we thought the international community would appreciate—backfired, in a sense, by China stepping back and saying, “This is very aggressive to us; this makes us feel less secure, and thus we will not engage in these conversations.”

Um, as Pranav pointed out, we were able to achieve some success with China after we had one—and only—engagement with them on risk reduction in November of 2023. We asked them for several things, and at the table, of course, nothing was necessarily accomplished or agreed to. But subsequently, we saw some movement in those directions. And one of them being the first missile launch notification of their ballistic missile launch over the Pacific—the first notification of this type of missile launch in over 44 years. Um, and that was one of the things we had discussed in our risk reduction dialogue: this would be useful to notify each other so that we understand these are tests; these are not intended to be directly escalatory.

Another request was for keeping a human in the loop in the nuclear decision-making arena—trying to come to some consensus on the risks inherent in AI participation in strategic decision-making. Um, and again, at the table, it wasn’t agreed to, and subsequently, at the end of the previous administration, there was a very big agreement between the leaders of China and the United States to actually preserve human decision-making capacity in this nuclear decision-making loop. So those are two things.

A third thing we talked about at the table during our arms control conversation was greater military-to-military engagement to prevent low-level misunderstanding and miscalculation. And we saw, over the course of 2024, a ramp-up in those types of military-to-military engagements. Um, you know, a third thing we asked for was greater engagement on perceived space threats that we all faced, regardless of geopolitical position. Um, and it would be a continuation of space security dialogues that had continued from the Obama administration up through Trump 1, and then had stopped during the first Trump administration. And so, a request for a continuation of those—also a request for more discussion of chemical and biological risks that we faced. Um, and those were two angles that actually the Chinese government was open to, at least understanding where we could discuss mutual perceptions of threat in those arenas.

And I think that would have been—and it’s something that I think should still be pushed on—because it’s in both countries’ interest to understand our mutual perception. So, the risk reduction angle was not immediately accepted at the table, I think, because we come at arms control from opposite sides. Um, at least before that November 2023 conversation, the Chinese government’s perception was that we wanted to use arms control to control them and prevent their weapons development. The U.S. perception is the arms control effort was more to prevent unnecessary risks of misunderstanding, miscalculation, and unintentional escalation.

So, um, we came at the conversation from different sides—from very much a lack of trust on both sides. And I think, as we rolled forward in 2024, we were able to see some of the communications be more effective. And that’s why there was a change, both in the performance of the U.S. side and some of the performance on the Chinese side, to result in the three changed behaviors that we discussed.

So, what I would take from Fiona’s excellent book is that having an appreciation for all sides’ efforts to control escalation—to understand how escalation can be managed—would be a useful lead-in to risk reduction. Not a lead-in of “we must control this weapons program or that weapons program,” or “we must cap you here and you here,” but more of a recognition that escalation management, unintentional escalation prevention, is in all countries’ interests. And if that can be the means for the conversation—not that we’re going to end our leverage points and our escalation dynamics in one fell swoop—but that there should be some capacity to say, “We want to avoid this, you want to avoid this; let’s figure out, at a very basic, fundamental level, where our cultural divides are preventing us from achieving a standard level of a meeting of the minds as to where it’s in our mutual interest not to misunderstand each other,” if that makes sense.

So, there’s a risk reduction element that’s inherent in Fiona’s book, I think—showing there’s a desire to manage escalation. And yet, we were not able to capitalize on that in a very fulsome way in the previous administration. I hope, from studying this book, we will be able to capture it more fully as this administration goes forward with China.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks, Mallerie. Um, Tong, if it were up to you—if you could put a few topics on the table for a risk reduction conversation from a U.S. perspective—what do you think those topics would be? And I think one thing we’ve observed over the course of the Biden administration was—unless this was orchestrated perfectly in both systems, where it got to a head-of-state-level agreement on what we should all be working on—it was unlikely to result in a really fruitful conversation at lower levels of government. So, any ideas that you’d like to convey? I’m sure someone from the new administration is watching us on YouTube.

Tong Zhao:

Yes, and that’s actually a central recommendation from Fiona’s book. Uh, she points out that, you know, this competition going forward is going to be increasingly about manipulating risk—at the same time, trying to manage unintended risks, right? But you still need to intentionally create the right level of risk; it’s central to deterrence effectiveness. So, there is a limit to which cooperative measures can minimize risk.

Um, and that’s why I think, you know, Fiona’s book points out—I think it’s the number one recommendation in the list—which is: we still need to work on the political disagreements, disputes, problems between the two countries. You have to reduce their interest in manipulating risk in the first place. Um, that’s a very important effort that people often ignore or dismiss.

Um, but as China becomes more rich in terms of resources and expertise and human capital, it will have greater access to more tools. Um, and it will increasingly develop a more symmetric capability to the United States. Um, there is always room to engage with China and help China understand—or jointly understand—what’s the best practice when it comes to new capabilities and postures, right?

China is making significant departures from its traditional nuclear operational strategy. It’s increasingly stressed addressing rapid-response capability, including—it’s interesting—launch-under-attack capability. If adopted, I think that will represent a major transformation in China’s nuclear posture and will introduce, perhaps, the greatest risk of unintended nuclear conflict—especially for a country that is relatively new to the game of relying on early-warning satellites, ground-based radars, and quickly assessing the scale of an enemy’s incoming attack and the intent behind it, and to quickly come up with a strategy to react in a 10- or 20-minute timeframe. And perhaps the increasingly felt need to use AI and other advanced technologies to accelerate and facilitate this decision-making under a suppressed timeframe—um, the risk of technology, of human error, or unknown unknowns in all these new systems and postures are something that I think both sides have an interest in minimizing.

Um, so the U.S. has more experience. It could, you know, share some of the best practices—the principles, not the operational details; those are certainly classified and very sensitive. But I think there are still ways for the U.S. to share best practices at the general level—high-level principles. Um, and they can at least minimize the risks that neither side wants.

Pranav Vadhyar:

I guess Fiona, you can have the last word on this, then we’ll go to audience Q&A. But I guess one question that came to mind in discussing risk reduction—you, in this book, talk about this sort of political imperative to ratify the Test Ban Treaty, all while still dealing with the Taiwan Strait Crisis that crossed ‘95 into 1996. Um, do you see that sort of desire to be seen as upholding international norms in the nonproliferation arena—obviously, the increasing confidence, perhaps, as China brings new nuclear capabilities and other strategic capabilities online—as maybe allowing for some of these more fruitful and open discussions to take place? Because historically, China has used ambiguity, or even opacity, as a reason not to engage in what we, in the U.S. government—at least in our former jobs—consider the kind of way that you do arms control or the way that you talk about risk reduction.

Fiona Cunningham:

Um, so I think I’ll just say one thing about the multilateral context and one about the U.S.-China piece of this. I think if China were the only country that viewed itself as modernizing its nuclear arsenal, then the pressure to be seen as upholding norms and upholding the nuclear security order would be much stronger. But China sees itself as one among a number of official nuclear-weapon states that are modernizing their arsenals right now. And so, in some ways, it’s sort of sharing the heat, if you like, for the modernization—uh, even if you might say that, you know, looking at the UK or the United States in comparison, these are a matter of replacement rather than the kinds of qualitative changes that I think Tong pointed to in his remarks.

Um, at the same time, though, midway through this year, China did put forward, in the NPT Review Conference preparatory conference structure, a multilateral “no first use” policy. This is a longstanding proposal that China has had on the diplomatic table, but with a little bit more detail than in previous years. And part of that, I think, was a desire to respond to the pressure on the nuclear-weapon states to show progress in their NPT commitments—to make good-faith efforts towards disarmament. Um, but the pressure, in some ways, is shared for China in moving forward in that kind of multilateral context.

I think in the U.S.-China context, you know, we often hear this adage of, “Well, China is building up its nuclear capabilities; when it reaches parity, then it’s going to talk to us.” Um, and I have hesitations about that expectation for two reasons. One of them is that I think, in some ways, it’s pretty optimistic about what China is going to do, even if it reaches very high levels of nuclear weapons. Um, as I point out in the book—and I think as is probably obvious to all of us on the panel and many of you in the audience as well—is that China tends to yoke progress on nuclear risk reduction, nuclear arms control, to the broader tenor of the political relationship. And so, if the political relationship is in bad shape, don’t expect China to engage in nuclear risk reduction—uh, not least nuclear arms control—even if it has the capabilities that put it in a solid position.

The second reason why I think the “parity and then negotiate” expectation could be misleading is because I don’t think that parity is actually a meaningful concept for strategic deterrence. Parity is a meaningful concept for gaining the political equality to be able to come to a negotiating table from a position of equality—as an equal. But in terms of strategic deterrence, you can gain just as much deterrence efficacy with a smaller or a larger arsenal as your adversary. So, parity is not necessary. You might want to have very high levels of retaliatory capability; you may want to have postures that enable you to do certain kinds of things. But parity itself is not the piece that gets you to a place where you feel comfortable that you have enough against your adversary.

Um, and so, I think I just draw a little caution on the “parity and then negotiate” piece in the U.S.-China relationship, because I think it’s a question of politics. Uh, and it is also a question—and just to jump off Mallerie’s comments as well—that China might not also choose the same content and form for risk reduction and arms control with the United States as the United States is used to from its relationship with Russia and the Soviet Union. And it needs time to sort of figure out how it can maybe get to some of the same places—in terms of, you know, for example, launch notification—but it’s going to do so tacitly, informally, without setting up a nuclear risk reduction and a formal agreement. And so, there needs to be, I think, a little bit of time for China to figure out, you know, whether it’s culturally, organizationally, in terms of its practices, what the form is and also what the content is to get us to a slightly less dangerous place.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks for that. And of course, Washington decision-makers are famously patient as it relates to nuclear issues these days, so—um, but we’ll take your advice on it.

==== Audience Q&A
Pranav Vadhyar:

Um, let’s go to audience Q&A. We’ve got about a half hour left here for the event. Um, I do have a couple of YouTube questions, but if I could start in the room—does anyone have any questions? We’ve got one over here and one over here.

Kirsten Azel:

Thank you. Thank you to all of you. My name is Kirsten Azel. I run a China-focused risk consultancy, and, uh, I would like to ask—mostly for Dr. Cunningham, but to all panelists—do you believe, just—this is off of your most recent comment at the end there—do you believe that the Party leadership does have confidence in its strategic capabilities now to assert strategic deterrence over the U.S., or when might it have that understanding? It’s within the context of this strategic substitution, so it would have to have confidence enough that it could do some traditional or conventional move with sufficient backup strategically. Has it reached that point yet? Thank you.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Do you want to kick us off, Fiona?

Fiona Cunningham:

Sure. Well, I’ll break it down into: What does China need to get coercive leverage in conventional conflicts, and what does China need for a robust retaliatory capability to deter nuclear attacks? These are sort of two components of what we might think strategic deterrence is doing.

Um, I think that as China’s conventional capabilities have evolved, it needs less leverage from whatever capabilities it’s going to choose to threaten escalation in a conflict. And so, I think the uncertain pillar of China’s strategic substitution is really the cyber pillar—the one where you start to see a little bit of questioning as to whether this is really going to give China the conflict-overturning outcomes that it has expected, despite the fact that it’s also engaged in the Volt Typhoon intrusions over the last two years that suggest this is still kind of the game plan.

Um, so it’s sort of difficult to tell if China thinks that it has enough capability to make a conflict sufficiently dangerous, sufficiently risky for the United States to hesitate about intervening, um, based on its assessment of how those three capabilities are going—and how much it needs to really sort of fill in for as its conventional capabilities have evolved. Um, but I don’t see signs that it’s running to the nuclear option to deal with problems with that substitution approach.

In the nuclear realm, I think it’s difficult to say—like, you will not get any Chinese expert to tell you, “This is what we’re aiming for, and this is what we think enough is enough”—both for the reasons of opacity that my co-panelists have mentioned, but also because it sees “how much is enough” as a moving target based on what the United States is doing—not just with its potential to increase the size of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, but also in the non-nuclear space. So, there is—Chinese analysts will often point to improvements in U.S. sensing capabilities to find China’s mobile missiles. There is also a “golden” proposal to increase the comprehensiveness of U.S. missile defense. And so, all of those changes outside of the nuclear domain also lift the threshold for China for “how much is enough.”

So, I think it’s certainly more confident than it was in the past, but whether it is confident that it has a comfortable margin for error to withstand any of the shocks that come from technological choices the U.S. might have going forward is a little bit trickier to say.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Tong or Mallerie, anything you’d like to add? Tong, come to you first.

Tong Zhao:

Um, I’m happy to add a comment because I think this is a very important question. And, um, it’s important because I don’t think China has clear thinking on this, right? If you look at—I fully agree with what Fiona has said in the book—but if you look at the major turning points after which China decided to double down on Information Age weapons development because of the felt or perceived need for coercive leverage, right? All these Chinese developments of Information Age weapons are driven by the leverage deficit, as called by Fiona.

But if you look at many of the crises—the turning points—those are not military crises exactly; those are political crises, right? The embassy bombing in Belgrade—that was just one incident, right? There was no military action-counteraction. Um, and as well as the 2022 Nancy Pelosi visit, after which, you know, Fiona said in the book, it might further prompt China to develop more future tools for coercive leverage. But again, that was a political crisis; there was no military action-counter-military action.

So, it’s unclear why China’s leaders concluded that with some new type of weapons, those crises would turn out differently, right? I’m like, if China had more precise conventional missiles or more or better counterspace weapons, China would be able to somehow influence those political crisis developments and lead to different results. So, I think it’s unclear in China’s thinking how, actually, the lack of political leverage and what military can translate into the desired practical leverage—that is never clear in the Chinese thinking. So that’s why it’s particularly hard to answer the question, “How much will be sufficient?”

Pranav Vadhyar:

A great point, Mallerie.

Mallerie Stewart:

Yeah, absolutely. I think there’s never a static moment in the arms racing of leverage, security feelings, deterrence. There’s always—sometimes a country may lag. In fact, I think the U.S. feels as if we may have lagged on our nuclear modernization or our nuclear deterrence angle, and thus we need to rush to catch up. Um, I think if any country feels too secure, there’s usually a backlash of, “Oh, well, all these other countries are building up their own leverage, building up their own capacities, responding to our potential perceived advantages with their own ability to protect and prevent the effectiveness of those advantages.”

So, it’s a constant, right? It’s a constant race; it’s a constant moving target. And so, I think that China is very aware right now of needing to fill in potential holes or to continue to strive to be able to protect itself and project power. And that’s why we see, again, the exponential increase of its nuclear arsenal, right? If it felt secure in its positioning, why would it feel the need to do that across the board? Why would it develop these strategic substitutions? Why would it look to continue a lot of the maneuvering it’s doing in various regions around the world if it felt comfortable in its positioning?

And I think most countries don’t feel comfortable for very long in this sort of geopolitical struggle at the strategic level. And so, even if there was a pause or a delay in some of these programs, I think, ultimately, there’s a constant feeling of, “What will the next leverage angle come from?”

Pranav Vadhyar:

That’s great. Thank you. Um, gentleman right here.

Lawrence Freeman:

Lawrence Freeman. I’m an independent consultant. I do work on geopolitical issues. Uh, in terms of recent developments—so President Trump, in his discussions on the Ukraine-Russia war, has said nuclear war is the worst thing we face—World War III. He’s said it pretty boldly, whether you agree with his analysis of the situation. So, he’s proposed, actually, a meeting for Russia, China, and the U.S. to discuss the reduction of nuclear weapons. Uh, first, how would you think China is going to respond to that?

Second of all, from the Chinese standpoint—if I understand it, I’m not the expert you are—they believe that their first effort was to achieve economic parity and development, and then now they’re putting money into expansion of the military capability in the PLA. Is it possible that China—even without Russia and the U.S., maybe on the Trump-Biden made China the enemy that built up our huge $1 trillion budget—Trump seems to be going in a different direction. Is it possible China and the U.S. could reach an agreement that escalation of nuclear war is not in their interest, and they each would rather spend the money making each one of their countries great again?

Pranav Vadhyar:

Uh, Fiona, why don’t you take the first crack at it?

Fiona Cunningham:

So, I’ll take the first crack. Um, I think—so, I mean, I’m recently returned from China, so I can perhaps say that comment was made while I was actually in Beijing. And I think people are very curious—they’re listening, they’re constantly looking out for these kinds of cues to see: Where are the opportunities for us to make progress on arms control? Where is the Trump administration’s attitude towards nuclear arms racing going to be?

On the one hand, we see expectations of continuity; we see people who could be considered China hawks in the administration. But on the other hand, they know that Trump is a dealmaker. Trump can be potentially quite unpredictable in the choices that he’s going to make, and that can generate these kinds of opportunities to really shake things up—and in a good way.

At the same time, though, they’re wary of, you know, how much stock should we put in these kinds of statements? For all of the reasons that I just stated, right—that the trends are pushing in both directions. And I think one of the other pieces of this is one of the first things the administration did was to announce that it was going to pursue a more comprehensive missile defense capability. And that really plays on one of China—and I should say Russia’s—worst nightmares when it comes to arms racing and the stability of their nuclear forces. So, you’re really seeing things pull in opposite directions.

Um, and I think, for China’s perspective—and the U.S. perspective as well—one of the issues is always going to be: How do we think of the priorities between managing nuclear risks and the risks of the use of nuclear war, and ensuring that our political objectives are protected? Right? Because nuclear weapons, you know, for both countries, do help them protect some of their most core and important political interests. And so, thinking about where those priorities are going to sit, I think, is one of the issues in the U.S.-China relationship—because thus far, I think the United States puts the risk of nuclear war as perhaps a greater concern than China sometimes does.

But China, I think, is certainly looking—at least diplomatically—where can they move next after the P5 statement in February of 2022 that “a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought”—a statement that Xi Jinping repeated with a number of different leaders, including President Biden. But really sort of thinking about where that agenda can go next, while at the same time not renouncing the buildup of their own forces to ensure that the nuclear weapons deliver that kind of security for their interests that they feel is essential.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Others?

Tong Zhao:

I’m happy to jump in. I, you know, I think from China’s perspective, militarily, it benefits China to prevent nuclear escalation because of growing Chinese conventional military advantage, at least in the Asia-Pacific theater. Um, so that’s why I think, partly, China has been promoting “no first use” agreements, etc.—because the United States now faces, I think, more pressure to consider threatening nuclear escalation in a future regional war with China.

Um, regarding Trump’s talk about China-Russia-U.S. nuclear denuclearization—um, I think the first message the Trump administration’s overall approach has sent to Beijing is: It’s a world going forward where the world is going to be increasingly led by the law of the jungle—it’s “might makes right.” Because the way the Trump administration so far has dealt with issues of the Ukraine war, dealt with allies, dealt with Russia—uh, you know, to Trump, what is really important is how much power you have, what your material capability is to make a difference, right? So that reinforces China’s belief that what really matters, eventually, is your material capability—um, and anything else can change.

Um, so I think that reinforces China’s commitment to long-term development—even greater military capability in general, including nuclear. Um, the second factor is, as Fiona mentioned, huge uncertainty with the Trump administration. Firstly, huge uncertainty after the Trump administration—we know that the Trump administration perhaps only lasts four years. Um, and what happens after that is hugely uncertain; it could be reversed quickly. Um, in that case, any nuclear arms control agreement with the Trump administration wouldn’t be sustainable. Um, so why would China seriously negotiate with the Trump administration?

Um, and secondly, the uncertainty within Trump’s administration, right? Trump is very different from the Trump administration. The DoD’s number one priority right now is to cut other programs but focus on the China threat. But Trump himself is sending a different message—it doesn’t necessarily see China as a threat; he talks about nuclear disarmament, a 50% defense budget cut. Um, so the internal debate and tension and inconsistency is huge. Um, so that, you know, encourages China to just wait out and see what really happens.

This also is true for all the major big items—like, you know, “Golden Dome.” It’s going to be so expensive and technologically challenging—I think China now has the confidence and patience to wait out and see what really materializes before becoming really concerned about the consequences and jumping into nuclear negotiating talks.

Uh, but I think the more positive scenario is if China thinks Trump personally is really interested in nuclear arms control and nuclear talks about nuclear weapons—uh, if Trump persistently presses this issue, um, I think that might get Chinese attention. And I think China is increasingly open to a bigger bargain with the Trump administration—including trade, economic, and maybe other core interests like Taiwan or the South China Sea. And if that increasingly appears possible, China might throw in nuclear arms control talks as a sweetener to get concessions on other core issues. In that sense, I see the greater possibility of a general discussion of nuclear weapon issues—uh, without any sense of urgency on the part of Beijing to push for concrete agreements.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Thanks, Tong. I mean, it’s a good point—if the new administration is willing to expand the trade basket, if you will, to include military infrastructure in the region or exercises or those types of things that I think would have been considered taboo in the last administration, then maybe that entices this type of discussion. So, Mallerie, in your last job, you had a lot of experience trying to get Chinese diplomats to the table on many issues—including in multilateral fora like the P5, First Committee, etc. Um, we’ve got an NPT Preparatory Committee meeting coming up. Um, as Fiona outlined, a “no first use” political statement is one of the things that China will be advancing. Um, do you think we’ll see reflections on this proposal by the president for a trilateral architecture at the PrepCom? And if so, how do you think it will be discussed among some of your former colleagues who will be there in New York?

Mallerie Stewart:

Yeah, I mean, I think Tong is exactly right that there’s a lot of confusion right now as to what the focus of this administration will be. Um, I think there’s been some inconsistent messaging—there’s been, you know, certainly less focus on a rules-based international order, less focus on following traditional normative approaches to regulating AI or the space arena, right? We’ve seen this administration, I think, to a certain degree, change its approach to some of the normative and rules-based approaches that the previous administration took.

So, you know, Tong’s point that this is sort of a “might makes right” is a challenging perception, I think, for other countries to interpret—to understand if there’s a possibility to cooperate, or if it’s just now a sheer arms race or a sheer race to see who is the strongest. Um, that said, you’re exactly right, and I think we’ve reflected some of the confusing statements about where the president is himself versus, potentially, where some of his cabinet or where Congress is with respect to their approach to China.

Um, the president has repeatedly talked about denuclearization. We saw him say that several times in Davos and then continue to make mention of the massive amounts of money that we pour into our nuclear arsenal. Um, so that is potentially a good lead-in to a basis for a conversation on nuclear risk reduction. It’s potentially helpful in the NPT context.

But I think the overwhelming response right now—potentially, in the absence of clear-cut policies or clear-cut approaches—is confusion, right? I think that, at least some that I’ve spoken with internationally, are trying to interpret the very different messages that they’re hearing, that they’re seeing, that they’re viewing playing out amongst the Trump administration, but also amongst the U.S. government and its allies. So, I think there’s a lot of open questions.

But I certainly agree with you, Pranav, that if the aperture is opened as to what could be discussed—both on the part of China and understanding what they would be willing to discuss at the table, as well as from the Trump administration and from Russia—there is a potential to at least find some commonality between the three countries. And I think that’s where there could be some cause for hopeful outlooks. Um, but I think, right now, in the context of very many different narratives and messages, it’s very hard to see how you crystallize that into something that’s positive moving forward.

Pranav Vadhyar:

Great. And as students of history know, combining the pursuit of an impenetrable missile defense shield with an offer of strategic offensive arms reductions is not a new playbook. It is something that was tried once before—albeit in a very different time when China’s nuclear arsenal and strategic capabilities were much lesser than they are today.

Cyber Warfare in a Taiwan Contingency (YouTube Question)
Pranav Vadhyar:

Um, let’s go to the internet for a question. Um, and if others have questions in the audience, please get them prepared as we’re running out of time. Um, and it’s a cyber question, so, Fiona, I’ll come to you first. Uh, based on the PRC’s theory of escalation and information warfare, what role will cyber warfare play in a Taiwan contingency, and how can the U.S. and Taiwan prepare? And I think that this would be something that allies would want to prepare for as well.

Fiona Cunningham:

Um, so it is a question that I look at in the book—examining the PRC’s doctrine, organization, signaling, and capabilities, insofar as they’re observable in the cyber arena. But I think that there has long been an understanding within China that offensive cyber operations can have a certain type of psychological effect—a strategic effect—on decision-makers because they can create paralysis, chaos among an adversary’s society, and then shape adversary decision-makers’ responses.

In addition to that, one of the other key ways in which China’s doctrinal writings deal with large-scale offensive cyber operations is to describe how they can also be used to attack the command-and-control networks that allow an adversary’s military to piece together different parts of their systems—and hence reduce the effectiveness of the way that they can use information to fight the contemporary joint operations that we would expect the U.S. and its allies to be fighting if there were a Taiwan contingency.

So, you might translate that into thinking that you will have some sort of attempt to use offensive cyber operations to shape U.S. decision-making, delay U.S. responses early on in a conflict, and that you might see relatively similar types of operations also leveled at Taiwan. And if we look at some of China’s cyber behavior as well—so, recently, large-scale revelations of the Volt Typhoon intrusions into both U.S. as well as allied critical infrastructure—and the U.S. government believes that this is intended to shape or slow down a U.S. response if there is any crisis decision-making.

What I think is interesting, though, is that you see, as of 2015 onwards, a greater interest in China in thinking about what they call “managing serious cyberspace crises”—not using these capabilities in reckless and uncontrolled ways that are going to generate uncontrolled risks of escalation because of the way that those cyber operations are conducted. So, there’s that desire to keep things controlled. And so, that leads to the question of whether China would automatically go about attempting to disable all of the infrastructure that it has penetrated immediately, or whether it would be looking at a more tiered or graded effort to generate escalatory pressure in cyberspace.

I will say, this is the one force posture of China’s Information Age weapons where it doesn’t use a particular type of term about generating escalatory momentum that you see in both the conventional missile as well as the counterspace portions—that suggests to me that how exactly you generate this kind of tiered approach or controlled approach to escalation using cyber operations is either absent or is still under development within the PRC.

So, that’s sort of the manner of using these capabilities. I think, in terms of responses for the Taiwanese as well as the United States, uh, one of the most obvious things that you want to do—the U.S. now has a cyber doctrine that involves trying to disrupt these kinds of operations before they’re conducted. So, find the malware, get it out of your system, try and avoid it from getting back in there—so that you’ve essentially taken away China’s ability to engage in these attacks before they begin. And maybe they’ll continue to try to do it again through different types of accesses and options, um, but still, it’s about creating more friction and difficulty for the PRC in preparing in that manner.

Of course, some things will slip through the cracks. So the other piece there would be preparing to make sure that you can quickly get these networks back up and running if data is wiped on them or if they are in any way disabled.

I think that's probably particularly important from the Taiwanese perspective—working on the resilience piece but also, to the extent that is permissible, working with partners in their private sector.


If you look at what happened with the Ukraine conflict, that really blunted the Russian efforts to use cyber operations to change the course of the conflict. It put a lot of pressure on Ukrainian decision-makers. The assistance of the private sector and NATO countries made a big difference in preventing Russia from having that impact.

That's something the PLA has noticed and is watching closely to see what the future of cyber operations holds, particularly what kinds of preparations led to less Russian success and more Ukrainian and Allied success.
