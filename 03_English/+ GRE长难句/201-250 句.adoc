- 202. Anthropologists 人类学家 and others /are__ on #much# firmer ground__ 处于更可靠的地位 /when they attempt /to describe the _cultural norms_ 文化规范 /for a small homogeneous 同质的 tribe or village /#than# when they undertake _the formidable 艰巨的 task_ of /discovering the norms /that exist in a complex modern nation-state /composed of 由……组成 many disparate 不同的 groups. +


人类学家和其他学者, 在试图描述一个同质性较高的小型部落或村落 的"文化规范"时，其研究基础, 远比他们要完成一项艰巨任务——即发现由众多异质群体构成的,复杂现代民族国家中"存在的规范"——时, 更为坚实。

- 203. *Not only* are liver transplants never rejected, *but* they even induce (v.) a state of donor-specific unresponsiveness /in which /`主` subsequent transplants of other organs, such as skin, from that donor /`谓`  are accepted permanently.

- 203. *Not only* are _liver transplants_ 肝移植 never rejected 从不排斥, *but* they even induce (v.)诱发 a state of _donor-specific unresponsiveness_ 供体特异性无反应 /in which `主` #subsequent transplants# of other organs, such as skin 皮肤, from that donor 捐献者，捐赠者；（化学）供体；（物理）施主 /`谓` #are accepted# permanently 永久地. +

肝脏移植, 不仅从没有被排斥，而且肝脏移植甚至会引发出一种捐助者特定的无反应状态。在这种状态下，从那个供给者得来的其他器官的移植，例如皮肤移植，会被永久地接受。 +
不仅肝脏移植从不会被排斥，它甚至能诱导一种​​"供体特异性无应答状态"​​——在此状态下，后续来自同一供体的其他器官（如皮肤）移植, 也会被永久接受。

'''

这句话阐述了肝脏移植中一个非常独特的现象，即肝脏作为移植器官, 不仅不会被受者免疫系统排斥，甚至还能诱导一种“供者特异性无反应”状态。这意味着，如果同一个人（供者）在肝脏移植后, 再次捐献其他器官，比如皮肤，受者也能永久接受，而不会发生排斥反应。

.Immune Privilege of the Liver
肝脏的免疫特权 (Immune Privilege of the Liver): 肝脏在免疫学上被认为是一个“免疫特权”器官，与其他器官相比，它对"免疫排斥"的抵抗力更强。

.Donor-specific unresponsiveness
Donor-specific unresponsiveness (供者特异性无反应) 是一种免疫学状态，指的是"受者"的免疫系统, 只对特定"供者"（donor）的组织或器官, 产生"免疫耐受"，而对其他任何非该供者的组织或器官, 仍然保持正常的免疫反应能力。

简单来说，*当受者达到这种状态时，他们的免疫系统, 会“接受”来自某个特定供者的移植器官，就好像这个器官是受者自身的一部分一样，因此不会发生排斥反应。但如果换了另一个供者的器官，受者的免疫系统仍然会将其识别为异物, 并进行攻击。*

*#这种"特异性耐受"与普遍的"免疫抑制"不同，因为: +
-> 普遍的"免疫抑制", 会削弱受者对所有外来抗原（包括病原体）的免疫反应，从而增加感染的风险。 +
-> 而"供者特异性无反应"则是一种更为理想的状态，它在允许移植器官存活的同时，尽可能地保留了受者对抗感染的免疫能力。#*

在器官移植领域，实现"供者特异性无反应"一直是研究人员追求的重要目标，尤其是在肝脏移植中，这种现象更为常见和显著。

许多初始研究, 仅仅考虑同一大小的海藻，这些大小恰好能够用网捞起来的海藻（网采浮游生物）。上述研究方法, 没有将更小的浮游生物考虑在内（超微浮游生物），然而现在我们知道, 食草动物主要依靠超微浮游生物为生。因此，这个事实导致了在后续研究中, 对于食草动物的作用的忽视。 +

deepseek : 或许正是因为早期研究, 仅考虑可用网具采集的藻类（网采浮游植物），而忽略了更小的浮游植物（微型浮游植物）——如今我们已知这些才是食植生物的主要食物来源——才导致后续研究, 低估了食植生物的作用。

伊斯兰法与其他法律形式截然不同（尽管在主题与成文法方面, 必然存在相当程度的巧合），以致必须研究它, 才能充分理解法律现象的全貌。

就主题和积极立法而言，伊斯兰法律, 不可避免地与其他法律存在着众多的相同之处。尽管如此，伊斯兰法律与其他所有形式的法律, 差异很大，为了尽可能地充分理解所有可能的法律现象的各个方面，对它的研究是必不可少的。

. Subject Matter (标的；主题事项；内容范围)
在法律中，"subject matter" 通常指法律所规范或涉及的具体内容、主题、事项或对象。它**指的是一个法律规则、法律案件、合同或条约, 所针对的核心问题或事物。**

例如：

- 合同的标的 (subject matter of a contract): 可能是买卖的商品、提供的服务、租赁的财产等。

- 案件的标的 (subject matter of a case): 可能是争议的财产、被指控的罪行、索赔的损害等。

- 法律的标的 (subject matter of a law/legal system): 指的是该法律体系所管辖或规范的社会活动、人际关系、权利义务等范畴。

在原文中，"as far as _subject matter_... are concerned" 意味着在法律所处理和规制的各种问题和领域上，伊斯兰法与其他法律形式可能会有相似之处。比如，所有法律体系都会处理财产、合同、婚姻、犯罪等问题，这些就是它们的“subject matter”。


.Positive Enactments (实在法制定；明文规定；实证法规)
**"Positive enactments" 通常指由权威机构（如立法机关、政府、司法机关）明确制定、颁布、公布的法律规则或法规。**它强调的是法律的“人定性”和“实在性”，*即这些法律是经过人类意志和程序而产生的，是可以通过查阅具体条文来确定的。*

这个概念与“自然法”（natural law，认为法律来源于普遍的"道德原则"或"神圣秩序"）相对。实在法是具体的、成文的、具有强制执行力的法律。

在原文中，"as far as ... _positive enactments_ are concerned" **指的是在"具体的法律条文、规定或法规"上，伊斯兰法可能与其他法律形式存在一致性或相似性。**例如，某些行为在伊斯兰法和其他法律体系中, 都可能被禁止（如盗窃），或者某些程序规定可能有相似之处。

总结原文的含义: +
结合这两个术语，原文的意思是：

*伊斯兰法是一种非常不同于所有其他法律形式的现象——当然，在它所处理的问题（subject matter） 和具体的法律制定（positive enactments） 方面，它不可避免地会与其他法律形式, 有相当多的巧合或相似之处——但即便如此，研究伊斯兰法仍然是不可或缺的，以便充分理解所有可能的法律现象的完整范围。*

换句话说，*作者承认, 伊斯兰法在某些具体内容, 和具体规定上, 可能与其他法律体系有表面上的相似性，但其深层的哲学基础、来源、结构和运行机制与众不同，因此值得独立深入研究。*

地幔分层理论的最佳证据是：大洋岛屿（被认为源自"下地幔柱"）的火山岩成分, 与"中洋脊系统"物质存在根本差异——而多数地质学家主张, 中洋脊的岩浆源来自上地幔。

这个既定事实最足以支撑地幔分层说：底层地幔上升, 形成了地幔柱状，地幔柱状又形成了一些海岛，这些海岛上的火山岩的成分, 完全不同于中部海脊的成分。大部分地质学家认为，中部海脊, 主要来源于上层地幔。

**这个假说认为, 地球的地幔（位于地壳和地核之间的一层）并不是一个均质的整体，而是由上下不同物理和化学性质的层构成的。**通常，*它指的是地幔被分为"上地幔"和"下地幔"两层，这两层之间的物质交换, 可能有限，或者存在化学成分上的差异。*

.mantle plume
地幔柱：地球地幔中异常炽热的熔融物质上涌，当它达到岩石圈时会向两侧扩散。

*"地幔柱"是指从地幔深处*（可能从"核幔"边界，即地核和地幔的交界处，或"下地幔"深处）*向上升起的、相对热的岩石柱状对流。这些热物质向上涌动，当它们到达地壳附近时，会引起局部的地壳隆起, 和大规模的火山活动，形成火山岛链（如夏威夷群岛）。*

.lower mantle  (下地幔)
下地幔：地球内部的一层，约占地球总体积的56%，位于地球表以下660至2900公里的区域。下地幔的压力和温度范围广泛，主要成分包括镁橄榄石、铁方镁石和硅酸钙钙钛矿。下地幔的研究, 对于了解地球内部结构和地球动力学过程, 至关重要。

**地幔的下部区域。**根据"分层地幔"假说，*下地幔的物理和化学性质, 可能与上地幔有所不同，并且被认为是一些"深部地幔柱"的起源地。它的深度通常从大约660公里（地幔转换带底部）延伸到2900公里（核幔边界）。*

.upper mantle  (上地幔)
上地幔：地球内部结构的一部分，位于地壳之下，主要由固态岩石组成，但在一定条件下会呈现部分熔融状态。

解释：**地幔的上部区域，位于地壳之下。**它包括岩石圈地幔（lithospheric mantle）和软流圈（asthenosphere）。*大部分的地质活动，如板块运动, 和洋中脊的火山作用，都与"上地幔"的物质对流有关。*

.the mid-ocean ridge system  (洋中脊系统)
解释： **"洋中脊"是地球上最长的山脉系统，位于海底。**它是板块构造中的一个重要组成部分，也是海底扩张（seafloor spreading）发生的地方。 +

形成机制： **在洋中脊，地幔物质（通常认为是来自上地幔）上升，冷却形成新的洋壳，并向两侧张裂，推动板块运动。这个过程伴随着火山活动，**形成洋中脊独特的山脊和裂谷地形。

大洋中脊系统是地球上最广阔的山脉，绵延近 65,000 公里（40,390 英里），超过 90% 的山脉位于深海水下。 +
**洋中脊出现在板块分离的边界上，地球构造板块分离时，新的海底便在此形成。**随着板块分离，熔岩上升到海底，形成巨大的玄武岩火山喷发 。扩张速度影响洋中脊的形状——扩张速度较慢会导致陡峭不规则的地形，而扩张速度较快则会导致更宽阔的剖面和更平缓的坡度。

- 246. In order to understand (v.) the nature 本质，特点 of the ecologist's investigation, we may *#think of#* _the density-dependent 密度依赖的；密度制约的 effects_ 密度依赖效应 /on _growth parameters_  生长参数 /*#as#* _the “signal”_ /后定说明 ecologists are trying to isolate (v.)分离；隔离 and interpret, /_one_ 后定说明 that tends to make the population increase (v.)  from relatively low values /or decrease (v.) from relatively high ones, /while 而，然而（表示对比） _the density-independent effects_ act (v.) /to produce (v.) “noise” /in the _population dynamics_ (人口动态) 动态.

要理解生态学研究的本质，我们可以将生长参数的密度依赖性效应, 视为生态学家试图分离和解读的"信号"——这种信号往往会使种群, 从较低值增长, 或从较高值衰减，而密度无关效应则在种群动态中产生"噪音"。

为了理解生态学家研究的实质，我们也许应该将关于增长参数的种群密度无关的效应, 视为一个“信号”，一些生态学家正在尝试分离这个效应，并解释其中的原因。这个“信号”一旦出现，就说明种群数量将会维持在一个相对稳定的水平，尽管与种群密度无关的效应, 将会使种群数量出现“异常值”。

.the “signal” ..., one that tends to make ...
one 指代“signal”. that引导的定语从句修饰 one.

.ecologist (生态学家)
解释： 专门研究生态学（ecology）的科学家。**生态学是研究生物体及其与周围环境之间相互作用的科学，**包括生物体与生物体之间，以及生物体与非生物环境（如气候、土壤、水等）之间的关系。

.density-dependent effects (密度制约效应)

解释： **指的是那些随着种群密度变化, 而影响种群增长率, 或个体生存/繁殖的因素和影响。**当种群密度高时，这些效应通常会增强，导致增长率下降；当种群密度低时，这些效应则减弱，甚至导致增长率上升。

例子： 食物短缺、疾病传播、捕食者数量增加、竞争加剧等。在密度高时，这些因素的影响更显著。

.growth parameters (增长参数)

解释： 指的是**用来描述和量化"种群增长"情况的##各种指标或变量##。**常见的"增长参数"包括： +
出生率 (birth rate): 单位时间内新个体出生的数量。 +
死亡率 (death rate): 单位时间内个体死亡的数量。 +
迁入率 (immigration rate): 单位时间内从外部迁入的个体数量。 +
迁出率 (emigration rate): 单位时间内迁出到外部的个体数量。 +
种群增长率 (population growth rate): 种群在单位时间内的数量变化。 +
承载力 (carrying capacity): 环境所能持续支持的特定物种的最大种群规模。 +

.density-independent effects (密度非制约效应)

解释： 指的是那些**不随"种群密度"变化, 而影响"种群增长率"或"个体生存/繁殖"的因素和影响。**这些效应, *#通常是由环境中的随机事件或外部力量引起的，无论种群规模大小，它们的影响程度都大致相同。#*

例子： 自然灾害（如洪水、火灾、地震）、极端天气（如干旱、严寒）、人类活动造成的污染等。*这些事件的发生和强度, 通常与某个区域的"种群密度"无关。*

.population dynamics (种群动态)

解释： **指的是种群规模、结构（如年龄结构、性别比例）和分布, 随时间变化的模式和过程。**生态学家通过研究"种群动态", 来了解种群如何增长、衰退、稳定或波动，并预测其未来的趋势。

.句子的整体理解
Gemini: 这句话用一个生动的比喻, 来解释生态学家在研究种群时所面临的挑战：

为了理解生态学家的调查本质，我们可以将"密度制约效应"对"增长参数"的影响, 视为生态学家试图分离和解读的‘信号’——这种信号倾向于使种群, 从相对较低的值增加，或从相对较高的值减少。而"密度非制约效应"则在"种群动态"中起到产生**‘噪音’**的作用。

换句话说：

**“信号” (signal): 指的是种群内部的、可预测的、由密度决定的调节机制。**生态学家希望通过研究这些机制，理解为什么种群在过低时会增长，在过高时会下降，从而趋向一个平衡点（或承载力）。这是种群自我调节、趋向稳定或周期性波动的内在规律。

**“噪音” (noise): 指的是来自外部的、随机的、与密度无关的干扰因素。**这些因素会##随机##地影响种群，使其偏离由"密度制约效应"决定的趋势，给生态学家的研究带来不确定性和复杂性。

*#生态学家的任务, 就是从复杂的种群变化中，识别出由"密度制约效应"引起的规律性“信号”，同时区分和量化由"密度非制约效应"引起的随机“噪音”，从而更准确地理解和预测种群的变化。#*

但该剧"将黑人自尊与人类团结, 视为兼容"的复杂观点，并不比杜波依斯"民族自觉与人类大同共存"的著名理想, 或法农"兼容民族认同的国际主义"主张, 更"矛盾"。

但是，这出戏观点复杂，认为黑人的自尊意识与人类团结, 是可以相容的；Du Bois著名的、深思熟虑的观点认为, 族群的自我意识与人类团结是可以共存；Fanon不断强调理想中的国际主义, 应该也可以包含民族身份和角色。这三个观点都是不“矛盾的”。
