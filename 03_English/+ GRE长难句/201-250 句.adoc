- 202. `主` Anthropologists and others /`系` are on much firmer ground /when they attempt to describe the cultural norms /for a small homogeneous tribe or village /than when they undertake the formidable task /of discovering the norms /that exist in a complex modern nation-state /composed of many disparate groups.

Anthropologists 人类学家 and others /are__ on #much# firmer ground__ 处于更可靠的地位 /when they attempt /to describe the _cultural norms_ 文化规范 /for a small homogeneous 同质的 tribe or village /#than# when they undertake _the formidable 艰巨的 task_ of /discovering the norms /that exist in a complex modern nation-state /composed of 由……组成 many disparate 不同的 groups. +


人类学家和其他学者, 在试图描述一个同质性较高的小型部落或村落 的"文化规范"时，其研究基础, 远比他们要完成一项艰巨任务——即发现由众多异质群体构成的,复杂现代民族国家中"存在的规范"——时, 更为坚实。

- 203. *Not only* are liver transplants never rejected, *but* they even induce (v.) a state of donor-specific unresponsiveness /in which /`主` subsequent transplants of other organs, such as skin, from that donor /`谓`  are accepted permanently.

- 203. *Not only* are _liver transplants_ 肝移植 never rejected 从不排斥, *but* they even induce (v.)诱发 a state of _donor-specific unresponsiveness_ 供体特异性无反应 /in which `主` #subsequent transplants# of other organs, such as skin 皮肤, from that donor 捐献者，捐赠者；（化学）供体；（物理）施主 /`谓` #are accepted# permanently 永久地. +

肝脏移植, 不仅从没有被排斥，而且肝脏移植甚至会引发出一种捐助者特定的无反应状态。在这种状态下，从那个供给者得来的其他器官的移植，例如皮肤移植，会被永久地接受。 +
不仅肝脏移植从不会被排斥，它甚至能诱导一种​​"供体特异性无应答状态"​​——在此状态下，后续来自同一供体的其他器官（如皮肤）移植, 也会被永久接受。

'''

这句话阐述了肝脏移植中一个非常独特的现象，即肝脏作为移植器官, 不仅不会被受者免疫系统排斥，甚至还能诱导一种“供者特异性无反应”状态。这意味着，如果同一个人（供者）在肝脏移植后, 再次捐献其他器官，比如皮肤，受者也能永久接受，而不会发生排斥反应。

.Immune Privilege of the Liver
肝脏的免疫特权 (Immune Privilege of the Liver): 肝脏在免疫学上被认为是一个“免疫特权”器官，与其他器官相比，它对"免疫排斥"的抵抗力更强。

.Donor-specific unresponsiveness
Donor-specific unresponsiveness (供者特异性无反应) 是一种免疫学状态，指的是"受者"的免疫系统, 只对特定"供者"（donor）的组织或器官, 产生"免疫耐受"，而对其他任何非该供者的组织或器官, 仍然保持正常的免疫反应能力。

简单来说，*当受者达到这种状态时，他们的免疫系统, 会“接受”来自某个特定供者的移植器官，就好像这个器官是受者自身的一部分一样，因此不会发生排斥反应。但如果换了另一个供者的器官，受者的免疫系统仍然会将其识别为异物, 并进行攻击。*

*#这种"特异性耐受"与普遍的"免疫抑制"不同，因为: +
-> 普遍的"免疫抑制", 会削弱受者对所有外来抗原（包括病原体）的免疫反应，从而增加感染的风险。 +
-> 而"供者特异性无反应"则是一种更为理想的状态，它在允许移植器官存活的同时，尽可能地保留了受者对抗感染的免疫能力。#*

在器官移植领域，实现"供者特异性无反应"一直是研究人员追求的重要目标，尤其是在肝脏移植中，这种现象更为常见和显著。

deepseek : 或许正是因为早期研究, 仅考虑可用网具采集的藻类（网采浮游植物），而忽略了更小的浮游植物（微型浮游植物）——如今我们已知这些才是食植生物的主要食物来源——才导致后续研究, 低估了食植生物的作用。
