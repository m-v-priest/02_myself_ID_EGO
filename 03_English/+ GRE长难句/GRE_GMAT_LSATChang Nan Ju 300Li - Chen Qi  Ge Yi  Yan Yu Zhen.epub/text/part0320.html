  <p class="calibre4">也许，当他意识到这个在过去使他成为被谴责对象运动的成功之后，他便试图去安抚讨好那些贬低他的人。于是他一边对这场运动的制度成功表达敬意，公开宣称这场运动“在法律研究上值得占有一席之地”，与此同时，他又任由别人从他令人信服的分析中自行得出“这场运动完全是一个人为的产物，不值得任何思想上的尊敬”的结论。</p>

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">请标出下列句子中的倒装、省略及长句。</p>

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">1. The history of global diversity can be summarized as follows: after the initial flowering of multicellular animals, there was a swift rise in the number of species in early Paleozoic times (between 600 and 430 million years ago), then plateaulike stagnation for the remaining 200 million years of the Paleozoic era, and finally a slow but steady climb through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras to diversity's all-time high.</p>

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">2. Though historically there is a discernible break between Jewish law of the sovereign state of ancient Israel and of the Diaspora (the dispersion of Jewish people after the conquest of Israel), the spirit of the legal matter in later parts of the <span class="kindle-cn-italic">Old Testament</span> is very close to that of the <span class="kindle-cn-italic">Talmud</span>, one of the primary codifications of Jewish law in the Diaspora.</p>

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">3. None of these translations to screen and stage, however, dramatize the anarchy at the conclusion of <span class="kindle-cn-italic">A Connecticut Yankee</span>, which ends with the violent overthrow of Morgan's three-year-old progressive order and his return to the nineteenth century, where he apparently commits suicide after being labeled a lunatic for his incoherent babblings about drawbridges and battlements.</p>

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">*4. The discovery that Haydn's and Mozart's symphonies were conducted during their lifetimes by a pianist who played the chords to keep the orchestra together has given rise to early music recordings in which a piano can be heard obtrusively in the foreground, despite evidence indicating that the orchestral piano was virtually inaudible to audiences at eighteenth-century concerts and was dropped as musically unnecessary when a better way to beat time was found.</p>

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">*5. In what, as one reviewer put it, was “clearly intended to be a realistic novel,” many reviewers perceived violations of the conventions of the realistic novel form, pointing out variously that late in the book, the narrator protagonist Celie and her friends are propelled toward a happy ending with more velocity than credibility, that the letters from Nettie to her sister Celie intrude into the middle of the main action with little motivation or warrant, and that the device of Celie's letters to God is especially unrealistic inasmuch as it forgoes the concretizing details that traditionally have given the epistolary novel (that is, a novel composed of letters) its peculiar verisimilitude: the ruses to enable mailing letters, the cache, and especially the letters received in return.</p>
