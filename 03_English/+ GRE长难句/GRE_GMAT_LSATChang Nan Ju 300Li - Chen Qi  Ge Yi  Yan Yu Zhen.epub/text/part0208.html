  <p class="calibre4">修正案言辞宽泛，这强烈暗示了立法者并不是试图将一系列具体的公民权写入宪法，而是试图将保证每位公民都享有相同的公民权这条原则写进宪法，这可以禁止有组织的社会将任何个人当做下等阶级中的成员来对待。</p>

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">请标出下列句子中的倒装、省略及长句。</p>

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">1.

  <p class="kindle-cn-para-no-indent">4. While Hume's history was generally seen as being less objectionable as his philosophy, there were widespread doubts about his moral soundness even as a historian by the time that Hanway was writing, and Gibbon's perceived tendency to celebrate classical paganism sparked controversy from the first appearance of his history of Rome.</p>
