- 351. `主` _Virginia Woolf_'s #provocative (a.)挑衅的；煽动性的；挑逗的，激发性欲的；引发思考的，启发性的 statement#  声明，报告/about her intentions  (n.)目的，意向，意图；打算 in writing (v.) Mrs. Dalloway 小说名 /`谓` #has regularly been ignored# by the critics 评论家；批评者；吹毛求疵的人, /since 因为 `主` #it `谓` highlights# (v.)突出,强调 an aspect of her literary interests 文学兴趣 /*very different from* the traditional picture 传统的形象,描绘 of the “poetic” (a.)诗歌的；充满诗情画意的，富有想象力的 novelist 小说家 /后定说明 ① #*concerned (v.) with*# 与…有关；涉及;关注于,专注于 examining (v.) states of reverie (n.)幻想；白日梦 and vision 幻觉、景象 / ② #and *with*# following (v.) the intricate (a.)复杂的；错综复杂的 pathways of individual consciousness (个体意识) 追随个体意识的复杂路径.


弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫关于她在创作《达洛维夫人》时的意图, 所作的引人深思的声明，一直被评论家们忽视，因为该声明突出地展现了她文学兴趣的一个方面，而这个方面, 与传统上“诗意”小说家——那种专注于审视梦幻和幻觉状态、并追随个体意识复杂路径的——的形象, 大相径庭。

原书作者翻译: +
评论家一贯忽视了Virginia Woolf在《戴洛维夫人》一书中有关创作意图的具有挑衅意味的言论。因为它强调了她文学兴趣的一个方面，她的这种兴趣不同于传统的关于“诗意”小说家的理解，这些传统的“诗意”小说家所关注的是审视白日梦和幻影的状态, 并且关注通向个体意识的复杂道路。

.Virginia Woolf (弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫)

20世纪英国著名的现代主义（Modernist）作家，是意识流小说的主要倡导者和实践者之一。她的作品以其深刻的心理描写、独特的叙事技巧和对女性经验的关注而闻名。

.Mrs. Dalloway (《达洛维夫人》)

弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫的代表作之一.

._Intricate (a.) Pathways_ of _Individual Consciousness_ (个体意识的复杂路径)

这是意识流（Stream of Consciousness）小说的核心特征。它指的是小说通过模拟人类思维的非线性、跳跃性、多层次的流动过程, 来展现人物的内心世界，而非传统的线性叙事。伍尔夫是这方面的先驱。

- 352. The physicist rightly dreads precise argument, since an argument that is convincing only if it is precise loses all its force if the assumptions on which it is based are slightly changed, whereas an argument that is convincing though imprecise may well be stable under small perturbations of its underlying assumptions.

- 352. `主` The physicist 物理学家 `谓` rightly 正当地；理由充分地 dreads (v.)害怕，担忧 _precise argument_ (论据；理由；论点) 精确的论证, /since 因为 `主` #an argument# /that is convincing (a.)令人信服的，有说服力的  /表条件 only if it is precise /`谓` #loses (v.) all its force# /if `主` the assumptions  假定，设想 /*on* which it *is based* /`谓` are slightly 稍微，轻微地 changed (v.), /whereas （表示对比）但是，然而 `主` #an argument# /that is convincing (a.) /though 虽然，尽管 imprecise  (a.)不精确的；不严密的/ `谓` #may well be stable#  (a.)稳定的，牢固的 /under small perturbations (n.)扰动；干扰 of its underlying (a.)根本的，潜在的；表面下的，下层的 assumptions.

#*物理学家, 理所当然地畏惧"精确的论证"，因为一个"只有在精确时才令人信服的论证"，一旦其所基于的假设略微改变，就会失去全部力量；然而，一个尽管不精确, 却依然令人信服的论证，在其基本假设发生微小扰动时，却很可能保持稳定。*#

这句话的核心思想, 是物理学（以及许多科学领域）中, 模型和理论的"鲁棒性"（robustness）。

物理学家**警惕那种"过度依赖特定精确条件的论证"。**
这种论证看似完美，但其有效性, 建立在极其严格且可能难以完全验证的假设之上。**而在现实世界中，任何物理模型的假设, 都只是对复杂现实的简化。因此如果一个理论的结论, 对这些简化假设的微小变动, 极其敏感，那么它在实际应用中, 就非常不可靠，**其解释力也大打折扣。物理学家知道, 他们的模型总会是近似的，基础假设总会有些许偏差。

物理学家更推崇的品质：鲁棒性（robustness）。

“不精确却依然令人信服”： 这指的是在一定误差范围内，或者在某种简化模型下，理论依然能够解释现象、做出预测，并且具有直观的物理图像。它可能没有数学上的绝对精确，但在物理概念上是深刻和有力的。

**“在其基本假设发生微小扰动时，却很可能保持稳定”： 这是鲁棒性的关键。**这意味着即使我们对现实的简化有所偏差，或者测量数据存在少量误差，理论的预测和解释能力也不会崩溃。它能在一定的不确定性下依然有效。

总结： 物理学追求的不是纸面上的完美精确，而是在一定误差和不确定性下, 仍然能有效运作的理论。**一个对初始条件或假设极度敏感的“精确”理论，在真实世界的复杂性和不确定性面前, 往往不堪一击。**相反，一个能承受一些“模糊性”和“近似性”的理论，反而更能揭示自然的本质。

- 353. Is _it_ not tyrannical (a.), in Pascal's sense, _to insist (v.) that_ /`主` #those# who *excel (v.) in* “_sensitivity_” or “_the ability_ to express (v.) compassion” /`谓`  *#merit (v.) equal wealth /with#* those who *excel (v.) in* _qualities_ (插入语 such as “the capacity for hard work”) 后定说明 _essential_ (a.) in producing (v.) wealth?

- 353. Is it not tyrannical  (a.)残暴的；暴君的；专横的, in Pascal's sense （对重大事情的）感觉，意识, to insist (v.) that /`主` #those# who *excel (v.)擅长；善于；突出 in* “_sensitivity_” （对细节或质量的）感知，觉察；（对新情况的）灵敏度；敏感 /_or “the ability_ to express (v.) compassion” (n.)同情，怜悯 /`谓` #merit (v.)值得,应受；应受赏（或罚） equal wealth# /with those who *excel (v.) in* _qualities_ 品级；品质；特性 (such as “the capacity for hard work”) 后定说明 _essential_ (a.)必不可少的，非常重要的 in producing (v.) wealth?

在帕斯卡看来，坚持让那些在“敏感性”或“表达同情心能力”方面表现出色的人，与 在（例如“勤奋工作能力”等）创造财富方面至关重要的品质上表现出色的人, 获得同等财富，难道不是一种暴政吗？


.excel
[ V] *~ (in/at sth/at doing sth)* : to be very good at doing sth 擅长；善于；突出 +
•She has always *excelled in* foreign languages. 她的外语从来都是出类拔萃。 +
•The team *excels at* turning defence into attack. 这个队善于打防守反击。 +
•As a child he *excelled at* music and art. 他小时候擅长音乐和美术。 +



这句话提出了一个深刻的财富分配和社会公平问题，并引用了帕斯卡的哲学思想, 来加重其批判性。

1.帕斯卡（Blaise Pascal）的“暴政”观：

- 帕斯卡是17世纪法国的数学家、物理学家和哲学家。他的著作《思想录》（Pensées）中，讨论了人类理性、信仰和权力。

- *在帕斯卡看来，“暴政”指的是将一套规则或标准, 不恰当地应用于不属于其范围的事物，或者说，用一种领域的特权, 去支配另一个领域。* +
比如，一个数学家试图用其数学权威, 去指导绘画，或者**一个国王试图用武力, 去统治思想，这些在帕斯卡看来都是一种“暴政”。他认为每个领域都有其固有的、正当的权威范围。**

2.原句中提出的核心问题：

作者提出的疑问是: 如果强行用财富这一单一标准, 来衡量所有不同领域的贡献，或者强行将不直接创造物质财富的贡献, 与物质财富的创造者同等对待（在财富分配上），可能就是对不同领域内在价值的一种混淆和侵犯。

这引发了关于社会应如何评价和奖励不同形式的价值的讨论：是只看物质贡献，还是也包括非物质贡献？如果包括，应该如何量化和分配？这触及了**功劳制（meritocracy）、平等主义（egalitarianism）和公正分配（distributive justice）**等复杂的社会哲学议题。

- 354. In the early 1950's, `主` #historians# /who studied preindustrial (a.)工业化前的；未工业化的 Europe (非限制性定语从句，用括号括起来，提供额外信息 which we may *define* (v.) here *as* Europe /in the period from roughly 1300 to 1800) /`谓` #began#, #(插入语)# for the first time /in large numbers 首次以大量人数（或首次大规模地）进行此行动, /#to investigate# (v.) *#more#* of the preindustrial 工业化前的；未工业化的 European population *#than#* the 2 or 3 percent /who comprised (v.)组成；构成 the political and social elite 精英：/ #(同位语)# the kings, generals  将军；上将, judges, nobles, bishops 主教, and local magnates 大亨；巨头 /who *had* hitherto (ad.)迄今；到目前为止 usually *filled* (v.) history books 迄今为止通常占据历史书中.

在20世纪50年代早期，研究前工业时代欧洲（我们在这里, 可以将其定义为大约1300年至1800年间的欧洲）的历史学家们，首次大规模地开始调查, 前工业欧洲人口中更广大的部分，而不仅仅是那占2%或3%、由国王、将军、法官、贵族、主教和地方权贵, 组成的政治和社会精英 ——这些人在那之前, 通常是历史书中的主要内容。

简而言之： 这句话讲述了20世纪50年代，历史学界发生了一个重要转向：研究欧洲前工业史的学者们开始将目光投向更广泛的普通民众，而不是仅仅关注过去历史书中记载的少数上层精英。

关于"后来成为美国的 那些英国殖民地历史" 的一个长期观点是：1763年之前，英国对这些殖民地的政策, 是由商业利益所支配的；而后来, 政策转变为更具帝国主义色彩（并以扩张主义的军事目标为主导），这才产生了最终导致美国独立战争的紧张关系。

- 356. Thus 因此、从而(引出结论或推论), `主` what *in contrast to* 与……形成对比；与……相反 the Puritan (a.)清教徒的，清教主义的 colonies /`谓` *appears to* Davis *to be* peculiarly Southern 在戴维斯看来，这些特征显得​​特别具有南方独特性 — (由破折号引导的同位语) `主` #acquisitiveness# (n.)占有欲;贪婪；物欲, _a strong interest_ (n.) in politics and the law, and a tendency 经常性行为，偏好；趋势，趋向 *to cultivate* (v.)开垦，耕作；栽培，培育 _metropolitan (a.)大都市的 cultural (a.)文化的，与文化有关的 models_ (都市文化模式) 培养都市文化模式的倾向 — `系` #was *not only*# *more* typically English 典型的英国式 *than* the _cultural patterns_ 文化模式 exhibited (v.)展出；表现出 by Puritan Massachusetts and Connecticut, #*but also*# almost certainly characteristic (n.)特征，特点，特色 of most other _early modern British colonies_ /*from* Barbados north *to* Rhode Island and New Hampshire.


“因此，戴维斯认为, 与清教徒殖民地形成鲜明对比、独具南方特色的那些方面——比如贪婪、对政治和法律的强烈兴趣、以及培养都市文化模式的倾向——不仅比清教徒马萨诸塞州和康涅狄格州所展现的文化模式, 更具典型的英式特征，而且几乎可以肯定地, 也是从巴巴多斯往北, 直到罗德岛和新罕布什尔州的 大多数其他早期现代英国殖民地 的共同特点。”

简而言之： 这句话的核心观点是，戴维斯认为, 南方殖民地的某些“独特”特征（如追求财富、关注政治法律、模仿都市文化），实际上在更广阔的视角下，不仅比清教徒殖民地更接近英国本土文化，而且也是其他许多早期英国殖民地的普遍特征，并非南方独有。

.appears to Davis *to be* peculiarly Southern: 从句的谓语动词短语。 +
#*appears to X to be Y：对X来说，Y似乎是……*#   +
本句的意思是 : 在戴维斯（Davis）看来，这些特征显得​​特别具有南方独特性​​。 +

appears to Davis​​“在戴维斯看来/戴维斯认为” +
to be peculiarly Southern 表示“特有的南方特色”。指“​​南方特有的​​”（即其他地区没有的）。

在上下文中的完整含义：​​ +
戴维斯认为，某些特征（如对财富的追求、热衷政治与法律、模仿都市文化）是​​美国南方殖民地独有的​​（与北方清教徒殖民地形成对比）。但作者随后反驳：这些特征其实​​更接近英国主流文化​​，且普遍存在于其他早期英国殖民地（如巴巴多斯、罗德岛等）。

- 戴维斯的观点​​： +
南方殖民地文化（如弗吉尼亚） vs 清教徒殖民地（如马萨诸塞） +
他认为南方文化有​​独特性​​（ peculiarly Southern）。 +

- 作者的反驳​​： +
这些特征​​并非南方独有​​： +
更符合​​英国本土文化​​（more typically English）； +
也存在于​​其他英国殖民地​​（从加勒比的巴巴多斯, 到北方的罗德岛）。 +

为什么用 "appears to" 而非 "is"？​​ +
​​#*appears to​​ 暗示作者对Davis观点的​​保留态度​​（后文会做反驳）。*#
类似中文的“看似……实则……”。


​​Puritan colonies​​（清教徒殖民地）：
指新英格兰地区（如马萨诸塞、康涅狄格），以宗教严格、重视社区为特点。 +
​​Southern colonies​​（南方殖民地）：
如弗吉尼亚、南卡罗来纳，以种植园经济、贵族文化为特点。 +
​​metropolitan cultural models​​（都市文化模式）：
指模仿英国伦敦的精英生活方式（如礼仪、建筑、教育）。

翻译建议： +
因此，戴维斯眼中那些与清教徒殖民地形成鲜明对比、​​看似南方独有的特征​​——对财富的追求、对政治与法律的强烈兴趣，以及效仿"都市文化"的倾向——其实不仅比清教徒主导的马萨诸塞和康涅狄格的文化模式​​更符合英国传统​​，而且几乎肯定是其他大多数早期英国殖民地（从巴巴多斯向北至罗德岛和新罕布什尔）的普遍特征。

布鲁斯通和哈里森的“去工业化”论点主张：美国企业在20世纪60年代末期开始的 "用国外制造业, 取代国内制造业"的做法，导致了美国工业的“空心化”；由此，那些因大规模工厂倒闭而失去制造业工作的工人, 发现自己或多或少 永久地转入了收入更低、更不稳定的工作，或者陷入了失业。

波斯纳批判“法律与文学”运动中的“律师能对涉及法律事务的文学作品, 提供特殊见解”这一假设，同时指出，文学作家使用法律, 是松散的，旨在传达一个特定的思想，或是作为 他们虚构作品中所设想的社会运作的 一种隐喻。


.Gemini 的解说:
这句话的核心, 是法律与文学研究领域中的一个"方法论争议"。

- “法律与文学运动”（Law and Literature movement）：这是一个跨学科领域，*研究法律与文学之间的关系，包括文学作品中的法律主题、法律制度对文学的影响、文学对法律思维的启发等。* +
该运动的“假设”：*通常认为，由于律师对法律有专业的理解，他们能够比普通读者或文学评论家, 更深入地洞察文学作品中涉及法律的层面。*

- 波斯纳（Posner）的批判：理查德·波斯纳（Richard Posner）是美国著名的法官和法律学者，对“法律与文学”运动有深入研究。他在这里批判的是上述假设的合理性。

批判的理由：

- 文学中法律的“松散使用”：*波斯纳指出，#文学作家在使用法律时，往往不像律师那样追求精确性、严谨性或法律条文的字面意义。他们关注的不是法律的实际运作或技术细节。#*

- 文学的目的：*作家使用法律, 是为了达到文学目的：*
.. *传达特定思想：法律可能成为表达作者哲学、道德或社会观点的工具。*
.. *##作为社会运作的隐喻：法律制度或法律事件, 在小说中可能象征着社会的结构、权力关系、人性的冲突等。##它是一种艺术手法，而非对现实法律的忠实再现。*

总结： 波斯纳认为，律师的专业法律知识, 在分析文学作品时可能作用有限，甚至可能误导，因为文学作品中的“法律”, 往往是服务于艺术表达和主题探讨的，而非法律本身的严格定义和应用。他强调了法律作为艺术素材, 与法律作为专业实践 之间的根本区别。

- *基因工程 (Genetic Engineering) / 转基因 (Transgenic Technology): 将目标基因从一个生物体中提取出来，经过处理后导入到另一个生物体中，从而改变受体生物体的性状。*

- 染色体 (Chromosomes): 细胞核内携带有遗传信息（基因）的结构。

- 豆科植物 (Leguminous Plants) 与固氮作用 (Nitrogen Fixation): **豆科植物（如大豆、花生、豌豆）的一个显著特征是, 它们能与根瘤菌（一种"固氮细菌"）形成"共生关系"。##根瘤菌在植物根部形成根瘤，将大气中植物无法直接利用的氮气,转化为氨，供植物生长，##而植物则为细菌提供生存环境和养分。**这种能力, 使得豆科植物在贫瘠土壤中也能生长良好，并且能提高土壤肥力，是农业生态系统中的重要组成部分。

- 非豆科植物 (Nonleguminous Plants): 除了豆科植物以外的其他植物。#*大多数农作物（如玉米、小麦、水稻）是"非豆科植物"，它们无法像豆科植物那样"自然固氮"，需要大量施用氮肥。*#

- “新颖的想法”： 句中提出的“新颖想法”吗是基因工程在农业领域的一个前沿构想——**##通过将豆科植物的"固氮基因"（或使其能与"固氮细菌"共生的基因）转移到非豆科植物中，使非豆科植物也具备"固氮能力"。##如果成功，这将显著减少对化肥的依赖，**对环境和农业生产都具有巨大意义。

- “强化研究”： 正是由于这种潜在的巨大应用价值，使得科学家们对豆科植物自身的固氮机制, 进行了更深入、更集中的研究，以便更好地理解, 和最终复制这些关键基因，实现非豆科植物的固氮改造。

可以制造出特定的互补DNA（cDNA），它们可以作为"分子探针"，用来寻找"肽激素"的信使RNA（mRNA）。如果脑细胞正在制造这些激素，那么这些细胞就会含有这些mRNA。如果脑细胞制造的产物, 与这些激素相似, 但并不完全相同，那么cDNA仍应该能与这些mRNA结合，但结合的紧密程度, 将不如它们与真实激素的mRNA结合得那么紧密。




这段话描述了分子生物学中利用"核酸杂交"（Nucleic Acid Hybridization）技术, 来检测基因表达的原理，具体应用在激素研究中：

- #*中心法则：DNA → mRNA → 蛋白质（激素）。细胞先根据DNA的指令, 合成mRNA，再由mRNA指导蛋白质（激素）的合成。*#

- cDNA作为探针： +
**cDNA（互补DNA） **是通过"逆转录酶", 以mRNA为模板合成的DNA片段。*它的碱基序列, 与目标mRNA的序列是互补的。 +*
*##这种互补性, 使得cDNA能够作为"分子探针"，像一把钥匙一样, ##去“寻找”并“结合”到细胞中特定的mRNA上。*

- 检测激素生产： +
*如果脑细胞制造某种激素：说明该激素的基因, 在脑细胞中被表达了。表达的过程, 会产生该激素的mRNA。因此，#用该激素的cDNA探针, 去检测脑细胞，就能找到并结合到这些mRNA上。#*

- 检测"相似但不完全相同的产物"： +
如果脑细胞制造的产物, 与目标激素相似, 但并非完全相同（例如，只是部分序列相同，或者有小的变异）：
.. cDNA仍然会结合：因为存在一定程度的互补性，cDNA仍然能够与这些“相似”的mRNA结合。
.. 结合不那么紧密：由于序列不完全匹配，结合的强度（即杂交的稳定性）会降低，不如cDNA与完全互补的“真实”激素mRNA 结合得那么紧密。 +
+
科学家可以通过调节结合（杂交）和洗脱的条件（如温度、盐浓度），来区分完全匹配和部分匹配的结合，从而判断细胞是制造了“真”激素，还是仅仅是“类似物”或有变异的产物。

.核心观点
这句话挑战了关于20世纪已婚女性进入职场原因的某些流行观念，提出了更深层的经济和社会驱动因素：

驳斥的观点 (X)：

- 家务机械化：人们可能认为，洗衣机、吸尘器等家用电器的普及大大减轻了家务负担，从而让女性有了更多时间外出工作。

- 闲暇时间增加：认为女性因此有了更多闲暇，选择追求事业。

真正的原因 (Y)：

- 经济需求：这被认为是首要原因。家庭需要更多收入来维持或提高生活水平，促使已婚女性外出就业。

- 高结婚率对劳动力市场的影响：
.. 缩小了单身女工池：*过去，许多雇主倾向于只雇佣单身女性*（因为认为她们没有家庭负担、更稳定，或避免因怀孕而离职等）。*高结婚率意味着单身女性数量减少，导致这个传统的劳动力来源枯竭。*
.. 迫使雇主改变雇佣策略：**由于单身女性劳动力不足，雇主不得不开始雇佣已婚女性，**从而打开了已婚女性就业的大门。

《分析评论》对女性小说那种故作高傲的轻蔑态度，太频繁地反映在了英国小说的文学史中；在这些文学史中，普遍流行将小说的兴起, 仅仅视为“五大巨匠”（笛福、理查森、菲尔丁、斯摩莱特和斯特恩）的专属历史，并因此忽视，或者至多是最小化了18世纪女性小说家的贡献。

总结：
作者指出，从《分析评论》时代开始，这种对女性小说带有偏见的看法（认为其不值得重视）一直延续到了后来的英国小说文学史中。结果是，文学史在描绘小说兴起时，只把男性作家作为核心，而系统性地忽视或贬低了18世纪女性小说家所扮演的角色和她们的贡献。

.The Analytical Review 《分析评论》

在这种观点的作用下，修辞艺术的地位, 从“被认为价值可疑”（因为尽管它既可能是快乐的源泉，又是促使人们采取正确行动的手段，但也可能是歪曲真相的手段, 和误导行为的来源）, 转变为完全被谴责，这也许是不可避免的。

- 修辞的定义：修辞是一种说话或写作的艺术，旨在说服、影响或取悦听众/读者。它包括语言的运用、论证的技巧、以及情感的调动。

- 修辞的矛盾性/“价值可疑”：

.. 积极面：它可以是“快乐的源泉”（通过优美的语言和表达带来审美愉悦），也可以是“促使人们采取正确行动的手段”（通过有力的说服力, 引导人们走向善）。

.. 消极面：然而，它也具有**“歪曲真相的手段”（通过花言巧语、诡辩来掩盖事实）和“误导行为的来源”**（煽动情绪，引导人们走向错误的方向）的潜力。正是这种两面性，使得修辞的价值一开始被认为是“可疑的”。

.这句里的 being regarded as #of questionable worth# 为什么中间要有个of? 直接写成 being regarded as questionable worth 可以吗

*这里的 "of" 是必需的，不能省略。*
这里的 "of" 表示属性、特性或价值。当我们要表达某物具有某种品质、价值或类型时，常常会用 "of + 名词" 的结构来作表语或宾语补语。

"worth" 作名词时表示「价值」，但​​不能直接用形容词修饰​​（不像 "great value"）。
必须通过 ​​"of + [形容词] + worth"​​ 结构（类似中文「具有…的价值」）。


of great worth（极有价值的）√  +
of little worth（价值微小的） √ +
great worth（错误搭配） × +

"worth" 在这里作名词使用，意为“价值、价钱”。 +

希尔说，单一国家内, 多个族裔群体的复兴，并非像乌尔班和舍策尔所暗示的那样，“潜在地威胁到国家的主权管辖”；相反，文化差异的彰显, 威胁要"揭示征服国家历史上赖以建立的那些民族中心主义的信仰和实践"，从而为一种“民族-国家”的可能性, 敞开大门——在这种国家中，被征服的族裔群体, 与征服族裔群体, 享有平等的权利，且不面临被迫害, 或被主导族裔群体文化同化的威胁。

•the assertion of his authority 对他权威的维护 +
•The demonstration was _an assertion_ of the right (n.) to peaceful protest. 这次示威游行, 是使用和平抗议权。



.Gemini 解说
这句话涉及到民族主义、国家构建和多文化主义的复杂议题：

- 乌尔班和舍策尔的观点：他们可能代表了传统观点，认为单一国家内, 少数族裔群体的文化复兴（或身份认同的强化）, 是对国家主权和统一的潜在威胁，因为它可能导致分裂主义或内部冲突。

- 希尔的反驳：希尔不同意这种观点，他认为真正的“威胁”不在于族裔复兴本身，而在于它所揭示的更深层问题：

.. 揭露民族中心主义：许多历史上的“征服国家”（通过军事扩张和殖民建立的帝国或国家）往往建立在某种民族中心主义的信仰和实践之上，即认为征服民族的文化、制度, 优于被征服民族。族裔群体的文化复兴, 会挑战这种“内在的”不平等，迫使人们重新审视国家成立的基础。

.. “民族-国家”的可能性：希尔认为，这种挑战, 反而为一种更理想的“民族-国家”（nations-state）模式提供了机会。这个词通常写作“nation-state”，但此处的引号和连字符“nations-state”, 可能强调的是多个民族（nations，作为文化实体）在一个国家（state）框架内, 实现"平等共存"的理想状态。 +
在这种理想状态下，被征服的族裔（historically conquered ethnic groups）, 将获得与征服者（conquering ethnic group）同等的权利，不再面临历史上的迫害（persecution）或"文化同化"（cultural assimilation）的威胁。

总结： 希尔的观点更积极地看待族裔复兴，认为它并非威胁国家主权，而是对历史不公的纠正，并可能引导国家走向一种更具包容性、尊重多元文化的“民族-国家”形态。

.Gemini 解说
- 非洲裔美国人自传的特殊性：在18、19世纪，许多非洲裔美国人的自传（特别是奴隶叙事）是由他们口述，再由白人编辑笔录和整理出版的。

- 编辑的“假设”：##**当时的编辑们（和后来的读者）普遍认为，他们可以将口述的“经验事实, 进行标准化处理——记录、整理、甚至添加自己的评论和背景信息，而不认为, 这会影响到叙述的真实性或其作为“非洲裔美国人意识产物”的有效性。**##他们可能认为事实是客观的，不分语境和编辑手法的。

- 作者认为, 这种假设“过于轻易地被接受”了。编辑的行为（脱离原始语境、添加外部评论）, 有可能会损害叙述的真实有效性（validity）。原因:

.. “脱离其原始语境”（taken out of their original contexts）：**口述叙事, 往往与特定的表演情境、听众互动、情感表达方式紧密相关。**一旦被书面化，这些语境信息就会丢失。

.. “编辑前言、脚注和附加评论”（editorial prefaces, footnotes, and appended commentary）：这些外部材料, 虽然旨在帮助读者理解，但也可能强加编辑的视角和解释，甚至歪曲原叙述者的意图，因为它不再是纯粹的自传主体（非洲裔美国人）的“意识产物”，而是混入了编辑（通常是白人）的意识。

因此，举例来说，数学家们可能会震惊地得知，描述氢原子的薛定谔方程, 并非对该原子字面意义上的精确描述，而只是一个对某种更正确方程的近似，这个更正确的方程, 考虑了自旋、磁偶极子, 和相对论效应；而且，这个经过修正的方程本身, 也只是一个对无限量子场论方程组的不完美近似。

即氢原子的薛定谔方程并非完全精确，而仅仅是更完整理论的近似，且该“更完整理论”本身也是一个无限方程组的不完美近似。

总的来说，**这句话是想表达：即使是看起来很精确的物理方程（如描述氢原子的薛定谔方程），在科学研究的更深层次和更高精度要求下，也只是一种近似。要达到更完美的描述，需要引入更复杂的因素（如自旋、相对论效应），而这些“更精确”的理论本身，最终也只是更基础、更全面的理论（如量子场论）的近似。**这反映了物理学理论层层递进、不断逼近真实的特点。


.薛定谔方程 (Schrödinger equation)

这是量子力学中的一个基本方程，由奥地利物理学家埃尔温·薛定谔在1926年提出。

*#它描述了微观粒子（如电子、原子）的行为，特别是它们随时间演化的状态#。在经典力学中，我们用牛顿定律描述宏观物体的运动轨迹；#在量子力学中，"薛定谔方程"则描述了粒子的"波函数"（wave function）如何随时间变化，而"波函数"包含了粒子所有可能的信息（比如它在某个位置出现的概率）。#*

可以理解为，它是量子世界的“牛顿定律”。

.氢原子 (hydrogen atom)

**最简单的原子。**它由一个质子（在原子核中）和一个电子（围绕原子核运动）组成。

**#由于其结构简单，"氢原子"常被用作"量子力学理论"的第一个应用和验证对象。#**对其的研究对理解原子结构和量子现象至关重要。

.字面意义上的正确描述 (literally correct description)

这里指的是绝对精确、毫无偏差的描述。在科学语境中，尤其是在数学家看来，如果一个模型或方程是“字面意义上正确”的，那它就应该能完全、无遗漏地反映被描述对象的每一个细节。

.近似 (approximation)

在科学和数学中，近似是指一个值、一个函数或一个模型, 接近但不完全等于"真实值"、"真实函数"或"真实现象"。

*在物理学中，由于实际系统的复杂性，我们常常使用"近似模型"来简化问题，以便进行计算和分析。这些近似, 在特定条件下是足够准确和有用的，但并非对现实的完美复制。*

.自旋 (spin)

*##这是粒子的一种内在量子属性，##可以理解为粒子自身的一种“自转”倾向，但它并非经典意义上的旋转。*

自旋是粒子固有的角动量，*##它会产生磁矩，对粒子的"能级"和"相互作用"产生影响。##电子、质子、中子等都有自旋。*

.磁偶极子 (magnetic dipole)

由电流回路, 或一对南北磁极, 产生的磁场源。

在原子物理中，*粒子的自旋（以及电子的轨道运动）会产生一个微小的磁场，使其具有"磁偶极矩"。这个磁偶极子会与外部磁场, 或其他粒子的磁场, 相互作用，从而影响原子的能级。*

.相对论效应 (relativistic effects)

*指当物体的速度接近光速时，根据爱因斯坦的"相对论"（特别是"狭义相对论"）所产生的物理现象，例如时间膨胀、长度收缩、质量随速度增加等。*

*##在原子内部，电子在原子核周围高速运动，虽然远未达到光速，但其速度已经足以产生不可忽略的"相对论效应"，##这些效应会微调原子的能级。*

.量子场论 (quantum field-theoretical equations)

现代物理学最基本、最成功的理论框架之一，*它将"粒子"视为"量子场的激发"。*

*##与"量子力学"主要处理固定数量的粒子不同，"量子场论"能够自然地描述粒子的产生和湮灭。它结合了量子力学和狭义相对论，##是描述基本粒子（如电子、光子、夸克）及其相互作用（如电磁力、强核力、弱核力）的理论基础。*

这句话中提到“无限的量子场论方程组”，这暗示了其理论的复杂性和深邃性，它可能包含无限多个自由度和更精细的相互作用。

- 351. Virginia Woolf's provocative statement about her intentions in writingMrs. Dallowayhas regularly been ignored by the critics, since it highlights an aspect of her literary interests very different from the traditional picture of the “poetic” novelist concerned with examining states of reverie and vision and with following the intricate pathways of individual consciousness.

- 352. The physicist rightly dreads precise argument, since an argument that is convincing only if it is precise loses all its force if the assumptions on which it is based are slightly changed, whereas an argument that is convincing though imprecise may well be stable under small perturbations of its underlying assumptions.

- 353. Is it not tyrannical, in Pascal's sense, to insist that those who excel in “sensitivity” or “the ability to express compassion” merit equal wealth with those who excel in qualities (such as “the capacity for hard work”) essential in producing wealth?

- 354. In the early 1950's, historians who studied preindustrial Europe (which we may define here as Europe in the period from roughly 1300 to 1800) began, for the first time in large numbers, to investigate more of the preindustrial European population than the 2 or 3 percent who comprised the political and social elite: the kings, generals, judges, nobles, bishops, and local magnates who had hitherto usually filled history books.

- 355. A long-held view of the history of English colonies that became the United States has been that England's policy toward these colonies before 1763 was dictated by commercial interests and that a change to a more imperial policy, dominated by expansionist militarist objectives, generated the tensions that ultimately led to the American Revolution.

- 356. Thus, what in contrast to the Puritan colonies appears to Davis to be peculiarly Southern—acquisitiveness, a strong interest in politics and the law, and a tendency to cultivate metropolitan cultural models—was not only more typically English than the cultural patterns exhibited by Puritan Massachusetts and Connecticut, but also almost certainly characteristic of most other early modern British colonies from Barbados north to Rhode Island and New Hampshire.

- 362. The “deindustrialization” thesis of Bluestone and Harrison asserts that the replacement of domestic with foreign manufacturing begun by United States corporations in the late 1960s resulted in a “hollowing out” of American industry, whereby workers displaced from manufacturing jobs through massive plant closings found themselves moving more or less permanently into lower-paying, less secure jobs or into unemployment.

- 363. Pocock's assertion that Jefferson's attacks on the commercial policies of the Federalists simply echo the language of the Tory opposition in England is at odds with the fact that Jefferson rejected the elitist implications of that group's notion of virtue and asserted the right of all to participate in commercial society.

- 364. Herbert Shaw argues that because scientists have underestimated the input of substantial amounts of energy from extraterrestrial impactors (asteroids and comets striking Earth), they have difficulty accounting for the difference between the quantity of energy produced from sources intrinsic to Earth and that involved in plate tectonics.

- 365. Critiquing the movement's assumption that lawyers can offer special insights into literature that deals with legal matters, Posner points out that writers of literature use the law loosely to convey a particular idea or as a metaphor for the workings of the society envisioned in their fiction.

- 366. One such novel idea is that of inserting into the chromosomes of plants discrete genes that are not a part of the plants' natural constitution: specifically, the idea of inserting into nonleguminous plants the genes, if they can be identified and isolated, that fit the leguminous plants to be hosts for nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Hence, the intensified research on legumes.

- 367. Some geologists, however, on the basis of observations concerning mantle xenoliths, argue that the mantle is not layered, but that heterogeneity is created by fluids rich in “incompatible elements” (elements tending toward liquid rather than solid state) percolating upward and transforming portions of the upper mantle irregularly, according to the vagaries of the fluids' pathways.

- 368. It is possible to make specific complementary DNA's (cDNA's) that can serve as molecular probes to seek out the messenger RNA's (mRNA's) of the peptide hormones. If brain cells are making the hormones, the cells will contain these mRNA's. If the products the brain cells make resemble the hormones but are not identical to them, then the cDNA's should still bind to these mRNA's, but should not bind as tightly as they would to mRNA's for the true hormones.

- 369. The increase in the numbers of married women employed outside the home in the twentieth century had less to do with the mechanization of housework and an increase in leisure time for these women than it did with their own economic necessity and with high marriage rates that shrank the available pool of single women workers, previously, in many cases, the only women employers would hire.

- 370. The Analytical Review's rather arch dismissal of novels by women has all too often been reflected in the literary histories of English fiction, where it has been popular to view the rise of the novel as the exclusive history of “the five greats” (Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne) and to ignore or at best to minimize the contributions of eighteenthcentury women novelists.

- 371. They were fighting, albeit discreetly, to open the intellectual world to the new science and to liberate intellectual life from ecclesiastical philosophy and envisioned their work as contributing to the growth, not of philosophy, but of research in mathematics and physics.

- 372. Under the force of this view, it was perhaps inevitable that the art of rhetoric should pass from the status of being regarded as of questionable worth (because although it might be both a source of pleasure and a means to urge people to right action, it might also be a means to distort truth and a source of misguided action) to the status of being wholly condemned.

- 373. 2. The resurgence of multiple ethnic groups within a single state, Hill says, is not “potentially threatening to the sovereign jurisdiction of the state,” as Urban and Sherzer suggest; rather, the assertion of cultural differences threatens to reveal ethnocentric beliefs and practices upon which conquest states were historically founded and thus to open up the possibility for a “nations-state” in which conquered ethnic groups enjoy equal rights with the conquering ethnic group but do not face the threat of persecution or cultural assimilation into the dominant ethnic group.

- 374. Because the increased awareness of civil rights in these decades helped reinforce the belief that life on reservations prevented Native Americans from exercising the rights guaranteed to citizens under the United States Constitution, the readjustment movement advocated the end of the federal government's involvement in Native American affairs and encouraged the assimilation of Native Americans as individuals into mainstream society.

- 375. 4. The people's liberty consists not in their original responsibility for what exists, but merely in the faculty they have acquired of abolishing any detail that may distress or wound them, and of imposing any new measure, which, seen against the background of existing laws, may commend itself from time to time to their instinct and mind.

- 376. There is, however, considerable disagreement among cultural historians regarding public attitudes toward the railroad, both at its inception in the 1830s and during the half century between 1880 and 1930, when the national rail system was completed and reached the zenith of its popularity in the United States.

Readers of African American autobiography then and now have too readily accepted the presumption of these eighteenth- and nineteenth-century editors that experiential facts recounted orally could be recorded and sorted by an amanuensis-editor, taken out of their original contexts, and then published with editorial prefaces, footnotes, and appended commentary, all without compromising the validity of the narrative as a product of an African American consciousness.

- 383. Thus, for instance, it may come as a shock to mathematicians to learn that the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom is not a literally correct description of this atom, but only an approximation to a somewhat more correct equation taking account of spin, magnetic dipole, and relativistic effects; and that this corrected equation is itself only an imperfect approximation to an infinite set of quantum field-theoretical equations.

- 384. Islam, on the other hand, represented a radical breakaway from the Arab paganism that preceded it; Islamic law is the result of an examination, from a religious angle, of legal subject matter that was far from uniform, comprising as it did the various components of the laws of pre-Islamic Arabia and numerous legal elements taken over from the non-Arab peoples of the conquered territories.

- 385. These questions are political in the sense that the debate over them will inevitably be less an exploration of abstract matters in a spirit of disinterested inquiry than an academic power struggle in which the careers and professional fortunes of many women scholars—only now entering the academic profession in substantial numbers—will be at stake, and with them the chances for a distinctive contribution to humanistic understanding, a contribution that might be an important influence against sexism in our society.

- 386. Calculations of the density of alloys based on Bernal-type models of the alloys metal component agreed fairly well with the experimentally determined values from measurements on alloys consisting of a noble metal together with a metalloid, such as alloys of palladium and silicon, or alloys consisting of iron, phosphorus, and carbon, although small discrepancies remained.

- 387. The traditional view supposes that the upper mantle of the earth behaves as a liquid when it is subjected to small forces for long periods and that differences in temperature under oceans and continents are sufficient to produce convection in the mantle of the earth with rising convection currents under the mid-ocean ridges and sinking currents under the continents.

- 388. While historians of literature have always been aware that writers work within particular traditions, the application of this notion to the history of political ideas forms a sharp contrast to the assumptions of the 1950s, when it was naively thought that the close reading of a text by an analytic philosopher was sufficient to establish its meaning, even if the philosopher had no knowledge of the period of the text's composition.

- 389. Many choose jobs entailing little challenge or responsibility or those offering flexible scheduling, often available only in poorly paid positions, while other working mothers, although willing and able to assume as much responsibility as people without children, find that their need to spend regular and predictable time with their children inevitably causes them to lose career opportunities to those without such demands.

- 390. Observing that species found on high ground are different from those on low ground and knowing that in the Amazon lowlands are drier than uplands, he proposed that during the ice ages the Amazon lowlands became a near-desert arid plain; meanwhile, the more elevated regions became islands of moisture and hence served as refuges for the fauna and flora of the rain forest.

- 391. Perhaps, recognizing the success of a movement that, in the past, has singled him out for abuse, he is attempting to appease his detractors, paying obeisance to the movements institutional success by declaring that it “deserves a place in legal research” while leaving it to others to draw the conclusion from his cogent analysis that it is an entirely factitious undertaking, deserving of no intellectual respect whatsoever.

- 392. The history of global diversity can be summarized as follows: after the initial flowering of multicellular animals, there was a swift rise in the number of species in early Paleozoic times (between 600 and 430 million years ago), then plateaulike stagnation for the remaining 200 million years of the Paleozoic era, and finally a slow but steady climb through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras to diversity's all-time high.

- 393. Though historically there is a discernible break between Jewish law of the sovereign state of ancient Israel and of the Diaspora (the dispersion of Jewish people after the conquest of Israel), the spirit of the legal matter in later parts of theOld Testamentis very close to that of theTalmud, one of the primary codifications of Jewish law in the Diaspora.

- 394. None of these translations to screen and stage, however, dramatize the anarchy at the conclusion ofA Connecticut Yankee, which ends with the violent overthrow of Morgan's three-year-old progressive order and his return to the nineteenth century, where he apparently commits suicide after being labeled a lunatic for his incoherent babblings about drawbridges and battlements.

- 395. The discovery that Haydn's and Mozart's symphonies were conducted during their lifetimes by a pianist who played the chords to keep the orchestra together has given rise to early music recordings in which a piano can be heard obtrusively in the foreground, despite evidence indicating that the orchestral piano was virtually inaudible to audiences at eighteenth-century concerts and was dropped as musically unnecessary when a better way to beat time was found.

- 396. 5. In what, as one reviewer put it, was “clearly intended to be a realistic novel,” many reviewers perceived violations of the conventions of the realistic novel form, pointing out variously that late in the book, the narrator protagonist Celie and her friends are propelled toward a happy ending with more velocity than credibility, that the letters from Nettie to her sister Celie intrude into the middle of the main action with little motivation or warrant, and that the device of Celie's letters to God is especially unrealistic inasmuch as it forgoes the concretizing details that traditionally have given the epistolary novel (that is, a novel composed of letters) its peculiar verisimilitude: the ruses to enable mailing letters, the cache, and especially the letters received in return.
