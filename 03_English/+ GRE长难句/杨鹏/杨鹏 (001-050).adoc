Islamic law is a phenomenon #*so*# different from all other forms of law--notwithstanding, of course, a considerable and inevitable number of coincidences 相当多且不可避免的相似之处 with one or other of them 与其中一种或另一种 *as far as* subject matter and positive enactment *are concerned* 就主题内容和成文规定而言 --#*that*# its study is indispensable /in order to appreciate (v.) adequately the full range of possible legal phenomena.


.Islamic law is a phenomenon #*so*# different from... #*that*# its study is indispensable  ...

这是"so... that..."结构的结果从句，说明"如此不同"带来的结果.

.*as far as* subject matter and positive enactment *are concerned*

#*“as far as... are concerned”​ 是一个固定短语，意思是 “就…而言；在…方面；至于…”。*#

- as far as：表示程度或范围，相当于“到…的程度”或“在…的范围内”。 +
-  ...are concerned：这里的 concerned是动词 concern（涉及，关于）的过去分词，用作形容词，意思是“有关的”。

字面意思：“到（某事物）所涉及的范围内”。

...*#as far as#* _subject matter_ and _positive enactment_ *#are concerned#*
实际意思是：“**#就#**"主题内容"和"成文规定"这两方面**#而言#**”​ 或者 “在主题内容和成文规定的范围内”。

作者用"as far as subject matter and positive enactment are concerned"来明确说明"相似之处"只存在于这两个具体方面，而不是整个法律体系.


注意：**当主语是单数时，用 is concerned；复数时用 are concerned。**但有时即使主语是复数，口语中也可能简化使用单数形式（不过正式写作, 建议保持"主谓一致"）。

对比示例：

- *As far as the price is concerned*, it's reasonable. （单数）
- *As far as the prices are concerned*, they're reasonable. （复数）
- As far as the prices is concerned... （错误，主谓不一致）

- As far as the children is concerned, they're doing well. × （错误. children是复数，必须用are） +
As far as the children are concerned, they're doing well. √

- As far as the weather concerned, it's perfect. × (错误. <- 缺少be动词) +
*As far as* the weather *#is# concerned*, it's perfect. √

例句

1.谈论个人观点或感受

- *As far as I am concerned*, this is the best solution.
（*就我而言*，这是最好的解决方案。）
- As far as the students are concerned, the new policy is unfair.
（就学生们而言，这项新政策不公平。）

2.限定讨论范围（最接近你原句的用法）

- *As far as* the budget *is concerned*, we have enough money.
（就预算而言，我们的资金是充足的。）
- As far as safety standards are concerned, this product meets all requirements.
（就安全标准而言，这个产品符合所有要求。）

3.商业或工作场景

- *As far as* the project deadline *is concerned*, we're running behind schedule.
（就项目截止日期而言，我们已经落后于计划了。）
- *As far as* customer satisfaction *is concerned*, our ratings have improved.
（就客户满意度而言，我们的评分有所提高。）

.positive enactment
*这里的 positive*​ 确实不是“积极”的意思，而是一个法律和哲学领域的专业术语，源自拉丁语 positivus（*被确立的、被制定的*）。

#*positive​ 在这里是指 “由人类权威（如立法机构）明确制定和颁布的”，与自然法、习惯法或道德法相对。其核心是 “人为确立的、成文的、实定的”。*#

- positive law (被确立的法律) : 人定法、实定法、成文法. 是由国家或立法机关, 正式制定颁布的法律.
- natural law​ (自然法) : 自然法、理性法. 源于自然理性或神意的普遍道德法则

在法律中文中，“positive law” 常译为 “实定法”​ 或 “制定法”。

.Legal positivism  法律实证主义

Wikipedia:

In legal philosophy, legal positivism is the theory that the existence of the law and its content depend on social facts, such as acts of legislation, judicial decisions, and customs, rather than on morality. This contrasts with theories such as natural law, which hold that law is necessarily connected to morality in such a way that any law that contradicts morality lacks legal validity.

在法哲学中， 法律实证主义认为法律的存在及其内容取决于社会事实，例如立法行为、司法判决和习俗，而非道德。这与自然法等理论形成对比，后者认为法律必然与道德相关，任何与道德相抵触的法律都缺乏法律效力。

Thomas Hobbes defined law as the command of the sovereign.

托马斯·霍布斯将法律定义为君主的命令。

According to the positivist view, the source of a law is its enactment or recognition by a legal authority that is socially accepted and capable of enforcing its rules. The merits of a law are a separate issue from its legal validity: a law may be morally wrong or undesirable, but if it has been enacted by a legal authority with the power to do so, it is still a valid law.

*根据实证主义观点， 法律的来源, 是其由"社会认可, 且有能力执行其规则的 法律权威机构"制定或认可。法律的优劣, 与其法律效力, 是两个不同的问题：一项法律在道德上可能是错误的或不合宜的，但如果它是由"有权制定该法律的法律权威机构"制定的，那么它仍然是有效的法律。*

Leslie Green summarises the distinction between merit and source: "The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); as we might say in a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a social construction."[1]

莱斯利·格林总结了功绩与来源之间的区别：**“一项政策公正、明智、高效或审慎，这绝不是认为它就是法律的充分理由；同样，它不公正、不明智、低效或不审慎，也绝不是怀疑它就是法律的充分理由。**根据实证主义，法律是既定的（秩序的、决定的、实践的、容忍的等等）；用更现代的说法，实证主义认为法律是一种社会建构 。” [ 1 ]

Legal positivism does not claim that the laws so identified should be obeyed, or that there is necessarily value in having clear, identifiable rules (although some positivists may make these claims). Indeed, laws may be quite unjust, and the government may be illegitimate; if so, there may be no obligation to obey the law. Moreover, the fact that a law has been found to be valid by a court does not mean that the court should apply it in a particular case. As John Gardner has said, legal positivism is "normatively inert".[2] It is a theory of law, not a theory of legal practice, adjudication, or political obligation, and legal positivists generally maintain that intellectual clarity is best achieved by separating these issues for independent analysis.

法律实证主义, 并不主张必须遵守已确定的法律，也不认为拥有清晰、可识别的规则必然具有价值（尽管一些实证主义者可能会提出这些主张）。##**事实上，法律可能相当不公正，政府也可能不合法；如果是这样，人们就没有义务遵守法律。**##此外，法院认定某项法律有效, 并不意味着法院应当在特定案件中适用该法律。正如约翰·加德纳所言，#*法律实证主义*#“在规范性上是惰性的”。 [ 2 ] ##**它是一种法律理论，而非法律实践、裁决或政治义务理论.**##法律实证主义者通常认为，将这些问题分开进行独立分析，是实现理论清晰性的最佳途径。

犹太法和教会法都比伊斯兰法更统一。尽管从历史上看，在古代以色列主权国家的犹太法律与散居地（犹太人在以色列被征服后的分散）的犹太法律之间存在一个可辨别的断裂，但《旧约》后期部分的法律精神与《塔木德》（散居地犹太法律的主要法典之一）的精神非常接近。

- (001.) That sex ratio will be favored which maximizes the number of descendants an individual will have and hence the number of gene copies transmitted.

- (002.) Hardy’s weakness derived from his apparent inability to control the comings and goings of these divergent impulses and from his unwillingness to cultivate and sustain the energetic and risky ones.

- (003.) Virginia Woolf’s provocative statement about her intentions in writing Mrs. Dalloway has regularly been ignored by the critics, since it highlights an aspect of her literary interests very different from the traditional picture of the “poetic” novelist concerned with examining states of reverie and vision and with following the intricate pathways of individual consciousness.

- (004.) As she put it in The Common Reader, “It is safe to say that not a single law has been framed or one stone set upon another because of anything Chaucer said or wrote; and yet, as we read him, we are absorbing morality at every pore.”

- (005.) With the conclusion of a burst of activity, the lactic acid level is high in the body fluids, leaving the large animal vulnerable to attack until the acid is reconverted, via oxidative metabolism, by the liver into glucose, which is then sent (in part) back to the muscles for glycogen resynthesis.

- (006.) Although Gutman admits that forced separation by sale was frequent, he shows that the slaves’ preference, revealed most clearly on plantations where sale was infrequent, was very much for stable monogamy.

- (007.) Gutman argues convincingly that the stability of Black family encouraged the transmission of--and so was crucial in sustaining--the Black heritage of folklore, music, and religious expression from one generation to another, a heritage that slaves were continually fashioning out of their African and American experiences.

- (008.) This preference for exogamy, Gutman suggests, may have derived from West African rules governing marriage, which, though they differed from one tribal group to another, all involved some kind of prohibition against unions with close kin.

- (009.) His thesis works relatively well when applied to discrimination against Blacks in the United States, but his definition of racial prejudice as “racially-based negative prejudgments against a group generally accepted as a race in any given region of ethnic competition,” can be interpreted as also including hostility toward such ethnic groups as the Chinese in California and the Jews in medieval Europe.

- (010.) Such variations in size, shape, chemistry, conduction speed, excitation threshold, and the like as had been demonstrated in nerve cells remained negligible in significance for any possible correlation with the manifold dimensions of mental experience.

- (011.) It was possible to demonstrate by other methods refined structural differences among neuron types; however, proof was lacking that the quality of the impulse or its condition was influenced by these differences, which seemed instead to influence the developmental patterning of the neural circuits.

- (012.) Although qualitative variance among nerve energies was never rigidly disproved, the doctrine was generally abandoned in favor of the opposing view, namely, that nerve impulses are essentially homogeneous in quality and are transmitted as “common currency” throughout the nervous system.

- (013.) Other experiments revealed slight variations in the size, number, arrangement, and interconnection of the nerve cells, but as far as psychoneural correlations were concerned, the obvious similarities of these sensory fields to each other seemed much more remarkable than any of the minute differences.

- (014.) Although some experiments show that, as an object becomes familiar, its internal representation becomes more holistic and the recognition process correspondingly more parallel, the weight of evidence seems to support the serial hypothesis, at least for objects that are not notably simple and familiar.

- (015.) In large part as a consequence of the feminist movement, historians have focused a great deal of attention in recent years on determining more accurately the status of women in various periods.

- (016.) If one begins by examining why ancient writers refer to Amazons, it becomes clear that ancient Greek descriptions of such societies were meant not so much to represent observed historical fact--real Amazonian societies--but rather to offer “moral lessons” on the supposed outcome of women’s rule in their own society.

- (017.) Thus, for instance, it may come as a shock to mathematicians to learn that the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom is not a literally correct description of the atom, but only an approximation to a somewhat more correct equation taking account of spin, magnetic dipole, and relativistic effects; and that this corrected equation is itself only an imperfect approximation to an infinite set of quantum field-theoretical equations.

- (018.) The physicist rightly dreads precise argument, since an argument that is convincing only if it is precise loses all its force if the assumptions on which it is based are slightly changed, whereas an argument that is convincing though imprecise may well be stable under small perturbations of its underlying assumptions.

- (019.) However, as they gained cohesion, the Bluestockings came to regard themselves as a women’s group and to possess a sense of female solidarity lacking in the salonnieres, who remained isolated from one another by the primacy each held in her own salon.

- (020.) As my own studies have advanced, I have been increasingly impressed with the functional similarities between insect and vertebrate societies and less so with the structural differences that seem, at first glance, to constitute such an immense gulf between them.

- (021.) Although fiction assuredly springs from political circumstances, its authors react to those circumstances in ways other than ideological, and talking about novels and stories primarily as instruments of ideology circumvents much of the fictional enterprise.

- (022.) Is this a defect, or are the authors working out of, or trying to forge, a different kind of aesthetic?

- (023.) In addition, the style of some Black novels, like Jean Toomer’s Cane, verges on expressionism or surrealism; does this technique provide a counterpoint to the prevalent theme that portrays the fate against which Black heroes are pitted, a theme usually conveyed by more naturalistic modes of expression?

- (024.) Black Fiction surveys a wide variety of novels, bringing to our attention in the process some fascinating and little-known works like James Weldon Johnson’s Autobiography of an Ex-colored Man.

- (025.) Although these molecules allow radiation at visible wavelengths, where most of the energy of sunlight is concentrated, to pass through, they absorb some of the longer-wavelength, infrared emissions radiated from the Earth’s surface, radiation that would otherwise be transmitted back into space.

- (026.) The role those anthropologists ascribe to evolution is not of dictating the details of human behavior but one of imposing constraints--ways of feeling, thinking, and acting that “come naturally” in archetypal situations in any culture.

- (027.) Which of the following most probably provides an appropriate analogy from human morphology for the “details” versus “constraints” distinction made in the passage in relation to human behavior?

- (028.) A low number of algal cells in the presence of a high number of grazers suggested, but did not prove, that the grazers had removed most of the algae.

- (029.) Perhaps the fact that many of these first studies considered only algae of a size that could be collected in a net (net phytoplankton), a practice that overlooked the smaller phytoplankton (nannoplankton) that we now know grazers are most likely to feed on, led to a deemphasis of the role of grazers in subsequent research.

- (030.) Studies by Hargrave and Geen estimated natural community grazing rates by measuring feeding rates of individual zooplankton species in the laboratory and then computing community grazing rates for field conditions using the known population density of grazers.

- (031.) In the periods of peak zooplankton abundance, that is, in the late spring and in the summer, Haney recorded maximum daily community grazing rates, for nutrient-poor lakes and bog lakes, respectively, of 6.6 percent and 114 percent of daily phytoplankton production.

- (032.) The hydrologic cycle, a major topic in this science, is the complete cycle of phenomena through which water passes, beginning as atmospheric water vapor, passing into liquid and solid form as precipitation, thence along and into the ground surface, and finally again returning to the form of atmospheric water vapor by means of evaporation and transpiration.

- (033.) Only when a system possesses natural or artificial boundaries that associate the water within it with the hydrologic cycle may the entire system properly be termed hydrogeologic.

- (034.) The historian Frederick J. Turner wrote in the 1890’s that the agrarian discontent that had been developing steadily in the United States since about 1870 had been precipitated by the closing of the internal frontier--that is, the depletion of available new land needed for further expansion of the American farming system.

- (035.) In the early 1950’s, historians who studied preindustrial Europe (which we may define here as Europe in the period from roughly 1300 to 1800) began, for the first time in large numbers, to investigate more of the preindustrial European population than the 2 or 3 percent who comprised the political and social elite: the kings, generals, judges, nobles, bishops, and local magnates who had hitherto usually filled history books.

- (036.) Historians such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie have used the documents to extract case histories, which have illuminated the attitudes of different social groups (these attitudes include, but are not confined to, attitudes toward crime and the law) and have revealed how the authorities administered justice.

- (037.) It can be inferred from the passage that a historian who wished to compare crime rates per thousand in a European city in one decade of the fifteenth century with crime rates in another decade of that century would probably be most aided by better information about which of the following?

- (038.) My point is that its central consciousness--its profound understanding of class and gender as shaping influences on people’s lives--owes much to that earlier literary heritage, a heritage that, in general, has not been sufficiently valued by most contemporary literary critics.

- (039.) Even the requirement that biomaterials processed from these materials be nontoxic to host tissue can be met by techniques derived from studying the reaction of tissue cultures to biomaterials or from short-term implants.

- (040.) But achieving necessary matches in physical properties across interfaces between living and non-living matter requires knowledge of which molecules control the bonding of cells to each other--an area that we have not yet explored thoroughly.

- (041.) Islamic law is a phenomenon so different from all other forms of law--notwithstanding, of course, a considerable and inevitable number of coincidences with one or other of them as far as subject matter and positive enactment are concerned--that its study is indispensable in order to appreciate adequately the full range of possible legal phenomena.

- (042.) Both Jewish law and canon law are more uniform than Islamic law. Though historically there is a discernible break between Jewish law of the sovereign state of ancient Israel and of the Diaspora (the dispersion of Jewish people after the conquest of Israel), the spirit of the legal matter in later parts of the Old Testament is very close to that of the Talmud, one of the primary codifications of Jewish law in the Diaspora.

- (043.) Islam, on the other hand, represented a radical breakaway from the Arab paganism that preceded it; Islamic law is the result of an examination, from a religious angle, of legal subject matter that was far from uniform, comprising as it did the various components of the laws of pre-Islamic Arabia and numerous legal elements taken over from the non-Arab peoples of the conquered territories.

- (044.) One such novel idea is that of inserting into the chromosomes of plants discrete genes that are not a part of the plants’ natural constitution: specifically, the idea of inserting into nonleguminous plants the genes, if they can be identified and isolated, that fit the leguminous plants to be hosts for nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Hence, the intensified research on legumes.

- (045.) It is one of nature’s great ironies that the availability of nitrogen in the soil frequently sets an upper limit on plant growth even though the plants’ leaves are bathed in a sea of nitrogen gas.
