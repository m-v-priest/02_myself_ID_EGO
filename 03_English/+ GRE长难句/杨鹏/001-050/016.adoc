- (016.) If one begins by examining why ancient writers refer to Amazons, it becomes clear that ancient Greek descriptions of such societies were meant not so much to represent observed historical fact--real Amazonian societies--but rather to offer “moral lessons” on the supposed outcome of women’s rule in their own society.

如果我们从考察"为什么古代作家会提及亚马逊人"开始，就会清楚地发现，古希腊对这类社会的描述, 与其说旨在呈现观察到的历史事实——真实的亚马逊社会——不如说旨在"就女性在他们自己社会中统治的所谓结果", 提供“道德教训”。

.ancient Greek descriptions of such societies `谓` were meant not so much to represent (v.)  observed historical fact ... but rather to offer...

#*“something be meant to represent (v.) ” 是 “use (v.) something to mean” 的被动语态。 +
mean在这里不是常用的“……的意思是”的意思，而是表示: 做某事所表达的目的、意图.*# 其英
文释义为：to serve or intend to convey (v.) , show, or indicate。

句中的结构为：something be meant *not so much* to...，*but rather* to...，实际上是把
*be meant to 和 not… rather…* 的两个固定搭配套在了一起，*意思是：不是为了……而是为了……。*

.to offer (v.) “moral lessons” on _the supposed (a.) outcome_ of women’s rule (n.)  in their own society.

supposed 的意思, 此词既有“据信，被认为”的意思，也有“预期的”意思，还有表示贬义的“假想的，被想当然的”意思。

英文释义为：

|adj.: held (v.) as an opinion 作为一种观点: BELIEVED;

|mistakenly believed: IMAGINED

|considered (v.) probable or certain 被认为是可能的或确定的: EXPECTED
|- it was not
supposed /that everybody could master (v.)  the technical aspects 人们并不认为每个人都能掌握技术方面的知识。

本句的 supposed 用法, 在此处的意思，用以上任何一个释义来理解居然都可以成立，既是在说一个预期的社会状态，又是在说一个虚构出来的、本来不存在的社会状态；其用法类似于中文中的“一语双关”.
