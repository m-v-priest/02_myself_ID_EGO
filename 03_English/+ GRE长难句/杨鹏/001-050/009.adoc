- (009.) His thesis works relatively well when applied to discrimination against Blacks in the United States, but his definition of racial prejudice as “racially-based negative prejudgments against a group generally accepted as a race in any given region of ethnic competition,” can be interpreted as also including hostility toward such ethnic groups as the Chinese in California and the Jews in medieval Europe.

他的论点, 应用于"美国对黑人的歧视"时, 相对有效，但他将"种族偏见"定义为“在任何特定民族竞争区域，基于种族, 对某个普遍被接受为种族的群体, 所作的负面预判”，这也可以被解读为, 包括对加州的华人, 以及中世纪欧洲的犹太人等族裔群体的敌意。
