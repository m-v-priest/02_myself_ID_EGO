- (007.) Gutman argues convincingly that the stability of the Black family encouraged the transmission of--and so was crucial in sustaining--the Black heritage of folklore, music, and religious expression from one generation to another, a heritage that slaves were continually fashioning out of their African and American experiences.

古特曼令人信服地论证道，黑人家庭的稳定, 促进了黑人民间传说、音乐和宗教表达等遗产的传承——因此在维持这些遗产方面至关重要——而这些遗产, 是奴隶们根据其非洲和美洲的经历, 不断塑造而成的。
