- (011.) It was possible to demonstrate by other methods refined structural differences among neuron types; however, proof was lacking that the quality of the impulse or its condition was influenced by these differences, which seemed instead to influence the developmental patterning of the neural circuits.

通过其他方法, 可以证明不同类型神经元之间, 存在细微的结构差异；然而，目前还没有证据表明, 这些差异会影响脉冲的性质或其状态，相反，这些差异似乎会影响"神经回路的发育模式"。

.#proof# was lacking (a.) /后定 #that# the quality of the impulse or its condition was influenced by these differences

*这里 that引导的同位语从句, 是修饰前面的主语 proof 的.* 因为它(that...)太长，所以为了避免头重脚轻，被放到了lacking之后。 +

正常的语序应该是: +
`主` *proof* 后定 that the quality of... `系` *was lacking* (a.).
