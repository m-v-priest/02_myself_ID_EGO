- (109.) These questions are political in the sense that the debate over them will inevitably 不可避免地 be less an exploration 探索；探究 of abstract 抽象的 matters in a spirit of disinterested 公正的；无私的 inquiry 探究 than an academic power struggle 斗争 in which the careers 职业；事业 and professional fortunes 命运 of many women scholars—only now entering the academic profession in substantial 相当多的；大量的 numbers—will be at stake 处于危险中, and with them the chances for a distinctive 独特的；特别的 contribution 贡献 to humanistic 人文主义的 understanding, a contribution that might be an important influence against sexism 性别歧视 in our society. +


- (109.) These questions are political in the sense that the debate over them will inevitably be less an exploration of abstract matters in a spirit of disinterested inquiry than an academic power struggle in which the careers and professional fortunes of many women scholars—only now entering the academic profession in substantial numbers—will be at stake, and with them the chances for a distinctive contribution to humanistic understanding, a contribution that might be an important influence against sexism in our society.

这些问题具有政治性，因为围绕它们的辩论，与其说是在一种超然探究精神下对抽象事物的探索，不如说是一场学术权力斗争，在这场斗争中，许多女学者的职业生涯和专业前途——她们现在才大量进入学术界——将岌岌可危，随之而来的是对人文理解做出独特贡献的机会，这种贡献可能对我们社会中的性别歧视产生重要影响。

- (111.) However, some broods possess a few snails of the opposing hand, and in predominantly sinistral broods, the incidence of dextrality is surprisingly high.

然而，一些孵化出的蜗牛群中会存在少数方向相反的蜗牛，而在以左旋蜗牛为主的群中，右旋蜗牛的出现率高得惊人。


- (112.) In experiments, an injection 注射 of cytoplasm 细胞质 from dextral 右旋的 eggs changes the pattern 模式；样式 of sinistral eggs, but an injection from sinistral eggs does not influence 影响；作用于 dextral eggs. +


- (112.) In experiments, an injection of cytoplasm from dextral eggs changes the pattern of sinistral eggs, but an injection from sinistral eggs does not influence dextral eggs.

在实验中，从右旋卵中注射细胞质会改变左旋卵的模式，但从左旋卵中注射细胞质不会影响右旋卵。


- (113.) Recently, some scientists have concluded that meteorites 陨石 found on Earth and long believed to have a Martian 火星的 origin 起源 might actually have been blasted 爆炸；炸开 free of Mars’ gravity 重力 by the impact 撞击 on Mars of other meteorites. +

最近，一些科学家得出结论，在地球上发现的、长期以来被认为起源于火星的陨石，实际上可能是由于其他陨石撞击火星，从而使其脱离了火星的引力。


- (114.) Under the force of this view, it was perhaps inevitable 不可避免的 that the art of rhetoric 修辞学 should pass from the status 地位；身份 of being regarded as of questionable 有疑问的；不确定的 worth (because although it might be both a source of pleasure and a means to urge 催促；力劝 people to right action, it might be a means to distort 歪曲；曲解 truth and a source of misguided 误导的 action) to the status of being wholly condemned 谴责；指责. +


- (114.) Under the force of this view, it was perhaps inevitable that the art of rhetoric should pass from the status of being regarded as of questionable worth (because although it might be both a source of pleasure and a means to urge people to right action, it might be a means to distort truth and a source of misguided action) to the status of being wholly condemned.

在这种观点的影响下，修辞艺术从一种被视为价值可疑（因为它既可能是快乐的源泉，也是促使人们采取正确行动的手段，但也可能是歪曲真相和导致错误行动的手段）的地位，转变为被完全谴责的地位，这或许是不可避免的。


- (115.) None of these translations to screen and stage, however, dramatize 改编成戏剧；使戏剧化 the anarchy 无政府状态；混乱 at the conclusion 结尾；结局 of *A Connecticut Yankee*, which ends with the violent overthrow 推翻；颠覆 of Morgan’s three-year-old progressive 进步的；先进的 order and his return to the nineteenth century, where he apparently commits suicide 自杀 after being labeled 把……称为 a lunatic 疯子；狂人 for his incoherent 语无伦次的；不连贯的 babbling 胡言乱语 about drawbridges 吊桥 and battlements 城垛. +


- (115.)

然而，这些电影和舞台改编作品都未能戏剧性地展现《康涅狄格州的美国佬》结局时的无政府状态，该结局以摩根三年进步秩序的暴力推翻以及他回到19世纪告终，在那里他因语无伦次地谈论吊桥和城垛而被贴上疯子的标签后，显然自杀了。


- (116.) Calculations 计算 of the density 密度 of alloys 合金 based on Bernal-type models of the alloys’ metal component 成分；组成部分 agreed fairly well with the experimentally 实验性地 determined 确定的；测定的 values from measurements on alloys consisting of 由……组成 a noble metal 贵金属 together with a metalloid 类金属, such as alloys of palladium 钯 and silicon 硅, or alloys consisting of iron 铁, phosphorus 磷, and carbon 碳, although small discrepancies 差异；不一致 remained. +

- (118.) Is it not tyrannical, in Pascal’s sense, to insist that those who excel in “sensitivity” or “the ability to express compassion” merit equal wealth with those who excel in qualities (such as “the capacity for hard work”) essential in producing wealth?

按照帕斯卡的说法，坚持认为那些在“敏感性”或“表达同情心能力”方面表现出色的人，应与那些在生产财富所需品质（例如“勤奋工作能力”）方面表现出色的人享有同等财富，这难道不是暴政吗？


- (119.) Yet Walzer's argument, however deficient 有缺陷的；不足的, does point to one of the most serious weaknesses 弱点；缺陷 of capitalism 资本主义—namely 即；也就是, that it brings to predominant 主导的；显著的 position 地位 in a society people who, no matter how legitimately 正当地；合理地 they have earned their material 物质的；实际的 rewards 报酬, often lack those other qualities that evoke 唤起；引起 affection 喜爱；感情 or admiration 钦佩；赞赏. +

Yet Walzer's argument, however deficient, does point to one of the most serious weaknesses of capitalism—namely, that it brings to predominant position in a society people who, no matter how legitimately they have earned their material rewards, often lack those other qualities that evoke affection or admiration.

然而，沃尔泽的论点，尽管存在缺陷，但确实指出了资本主义最严重的弱点之一——即它将那些无论多么合法地获得物质回报的人，置于社会的主导地位，但这些人却常常缺乏那些能唤起情感或钦佩的其他品质。


- (120.) The appreciation 欣赏；理解 of traditional oral 口头的；口述的 American Indian literature 文学 has been limited, hampered 阻碍；妨碍 by poor translations and by the difficulty, even in the rare culturally 文化上的 sensitive 敏感的 and aesthetically 审美地；美学上的 satisfying translation, of completely conveying 传达；表达 the original’s verse 诗歌 structure 结构, tone 语气；语调, and syntax 句法. +


- (120.) The appreciation of traditional oral American Indian literature has been limited, hampered by poor translations and by the difficulty, even in the rare culturally sensitive and aesthetically satisfying translation, of completely conveying the original’s verse structure, tone, and syntax.

对传统美洲印第安口头文学的鉴赏一直受到限制，这既因拙劣的翻译所阻碍，也因即使在罕见的文化敏感且美学上令人满意的译本中，也难以完全传达原文的诗歌结构、语调和句法。

- (121.) Mores, which embodied each culture’s ideal principles for governing every citizen, were developed in the belief that the foundation of a community lies in the cultivation of individual powers to be placed in service to the community.

风俗，作为每种文化中管理每个公民的理想原则的体现，其发展是基于这样一种信念：社区的基础在于培养个人的能力，并将其投入到为社区服务的过程中。

- (122.) Only in the case of the February Revolution do we lack a useful description of participants that might characterize it in the light of what social history has taught us about the process of revolutionary mobilization.

只有在二月革命的案例中，我们才缺乏对参与者的有用描述，这些描述本可以根据社会历史告诉我们的关于革命动员过程的知识来对其进行刻画。

- (124.) Anthropologists 人类学家 and others are on much firmer ground 更坚实的基础 when they attempt to describe the cultural norms 规范；标准 for a small homogeneous 同种类的；同性质的 tribe 部落 or village than when they undertake 承担；着手做 the formidable 艰巨的；可怕的 task 任务 of discovering the norms that exist in a complex 复杂的 modern nation-state 单一民族国家 composed of 由……组成 many disparate 不同的；不相干的 groups. +

- (126.) It has thus generally been by way of 借助于；通过……方式 the emphasis 强调；重视 on oral literary creativity 创造力 that these Chicano 奇卡诺人的 writers, whose English-language works are sometimes uninspired 缺乏创见的；平淡的, developed the powerful and arresting 引人注目的 language that characterized 以……为特征 their Spanish-language works. +

- (128.) The broad 宽泛的；概括的 language of the amendment strongly suggests that its framers 制定者 were proposing to write into the Constitution 宪法 not a laundry list 冗长的清单 of specific civil rights but a principle 原则 of equal citizenship that forbids 禁止 organized society from treating any individual 个人 as a member of an inferior 低等的；较差的 class. +

- (129.) This doctrine has broadened the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to other, nonracial forms of discrimination, for while some justices have refused to find any legislative classification other than race to be constitutionally disfavored, most have been receptive to arguments that at least some nonracial discriminations, sexual discrimination in particular, are “suspect” and deserve this heightened scrutiny by the courts.

这一原则拓宽了第十四修正案对其他非种族歧视形式的适用范围，因为尽管有些法官拒绝认定除种族之外的任何立法分类在宪法上不受青睐，但大多数法官都乐于接受这样的论点：至少某些非种族歧视，特别是性别歧视，是“可疑的”，并值得法院进行这种更严格的审查。


- (130.) Civil rights activists 积极分子 have long argued that one of the principal 主要的；最重要的 reasons why Blacks, Hispanics 西班牙裔美国人, and other minority groups 少数群体 have difficulty establishing 建立；创立 themselves in business is that they lack access to 有机会使用；能接近 the sizable 相当大的 orders 订单 and subcontracts 分包合同 that are generated by 由……产生 large companies. +

- (101.) The correlation of carbon dioxide with temperature, of course, does not establish whether changes in atmospheric composition caused the warming and cooling trends or were caused by them.

- (102.) Such philosophical concerns as the mind-body problem or, more generally, the nature of human knowledge, they believe, are basic human questions whose tentative philosophical solutions have served as the necessary foundations on which all other intellectual speculation has rested.

- (103.) The idea of an autonomous discipline called “philosophy” distinct from and sitting in judgment on such pursuits as theology and science turns out, on close examination, to be of quite recent origin.

- (104.) They were fighting, albeit discreetly, to open the intellectual world to the new science and to liberate intellectual life from ecclesiastical philosophy and envisioned their work as contributing to the growth, not of philosophy, but of research in mathematics and physics.

- (105.) But the recent discovery of detailed similarities in the skeletal structure of the flippers in all three groups undermines the attempt to explain away superficial resemblance as due to convergent evolution--the independent development of similarities between unrelated groups in response to similar environmental pressures.

- (106.) Human genes contain too little information even to specify which hemisphere of the brain each of a human’s 10^11 neurons should, let alone the hundreds of connections that each neuron makes.

- (107.) For the woman who is a practitioner of feminist literary criticism, the subjectivity, or critic-as-artist-or-scientist, debate has special significance; for her, the question is not only academic, but political as well, and her definition will court special risks whichever side of the issue it favors.

- (108.) If she defines feminist criticism as objective and scientific--a valid, verifiable, intellectual method that anyone, whether man or woman, can perform—the definition not only precludes the critic-as-artist approach, but may also impede accomplishment of the utilitarian political objectives of those who seek to change the academic establishment and its thinking, especially about sex roles.

- (109.) These questions are political in the sense that the debate over them will inevitably be less an exploration of abstract matters in a spirit of disinterested inquiry than an academic power struggle in which the careers and professional fortunes of many women scholars—only now entering the academic profession in substantial numbers—will be at stake, and with them the chances for a distinctive contribution to humanistic understanding, a contribution that might be an important influence against sexism in our society.

- (110.) Perhaps he believed that he could not criticize American foreign policy without endangering the support for civil rights that he had won from the federal government.

- (111.) However, some broods possess a few snails of the opposing hand, and in predominantly sinistral broods, the incidence of dextrality is surprisingly high.

- (112.) In experiments, an injection of cytoplasm from dextral eggs changes the pattern of sinistral eggs, but an injection from sinistral eggs does not influence dextral eggs.

- (113.) Recently, some scientists have concluded that meteorites found on Earth and long believed to have a Martian origin might actually have been blasted free of Mars’ gravity by the impact on Mars of other meteorites.

- (114.) Under the force of this view, it was perhaps inevitable that the art of rhetoric should pass from the status of being regarded as of questionable worth (because although it might be both a source of pleasure and a means to urge people to right action, it might be a means to distort truth and a source of misguided action) to the status of being wholly condemned.

- (115.) None of these translations to screen and stage, however, dramatize the anarchy at the conclusion of A Connecticut Yankee, which ends with the violent overthrow of Morgan’s three-year-old progressive order and his return to the nineteenth century, where he apparently commits suicide after being labeled a lunatic for his incoherent babbling about drawbridges and battlements.

- (116.) Calculations of the density of alloys based on Bernal-type models of the alloys’ metal component agreed fairly well with the experimentally determined values from measurements on alloys consisting of a noble metal together with a metalloid, such as alloys of palladium and silicon, or alloys consisting of iron, phosphorus, and carbon, although small discrepancies remained.

- (117.) And Walzer advocates the means of eliminating this tyranny and of restoring genuine equality: “the abolition of the power of money outside its sphere”.

- (118.) Is it not tyrannical, in Pascal’s sense, to insist that those who excel in “sensitivity” or “the ability to express compassion” merit equal wealth with those who excel in qualities (such as “the capacity for hard work”) essential in producing wealth?

- (119.) Yet Walzer's argument, however deficient, does point to one of the most serious weaknesses of capitalism—namely, that it brings to predominant position in a society people who, no matter how legitimately they have earned their material rewards, often lack those other qualities that evoke affection or admiration.

- (120.) The appreciation of traditional oral American Indian literature has been limited, hampered by poor translations and by the difficulty, even in the rare culturally sensitive and aesthetically satisfying translation, of completely conveying the original’s verse structure, tone, and syntax.

- (121.) Mores, which embodied each culture’s ideal principles for governing every citizen, were developed in the belief that the foundation of a community lies in the cultivation of individual powers to be placed in service to the community.

- (122.) Only in the case of the February Revolution do we lack a useful description of participants that might characterize it in the light of what social history has taught us about the process of revolutionary mobilization.

- (123.) As a consequence, it may prove difficult or impossible to establish for a successful revolution a comprehensive and trustworthy picture of those who participated, or to answer even the most basic question one might pose concerning the social origins of the insurgents.

- (124.) Anthropologists and others are on much firmer ground when they attempt to describe the cultural norms for a small homogeneous tribe or village than when they undertake the formidable task of discovering the norms that exist in a complex modern nation-state composed of many disparate groups.

- (125.) The Italian influence is likely, whatever Valdez’ immediate source: the Mexican carpas themselves are said to have originated from the theater pieces of a sixteenth-century Spanish writer inspired by encounters with Italian commedia dell’arte troupes on tour in Spain.

- (126.) It has thus generally been by way of the emphasis on oral literary creativity that these Chicano writers, whose English-language works are sometimes uninspired, developed the powerful and arresting language that characterized their Spanish-language works.

- (127.) This declaration, which was echoed in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment, was designed primarily to counter the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford that Black people in the United States could be denied citizenship.

- (128.) The broad language of the amendment strongly suggests that its framers were proposing to write into the Constitution not a laundry list of specific civil rights but a principle of equal citizenship that forbids organized society from treating any individual as a member of an inferior class.

- (129.) This doctrine has broadened the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to other, nonracial forms of discrimination, for while some justices have refused to find any legislative classification other than race to be constitutionally disfavored, most have been receptive to arguments that at least some nonracial discriminations, sexual discrimination in particular, are “suspect” and deserve this heightened scrutiny by the courts.

- (130.) Civil rights activists have long argued that one of the principal reasons why Blacks, Hispanics, and other minority groups have difficulty establishing themselves in business is that they lack access to the sizable orders and subcontracts that are generated by large companies.

- (131.) Fascination with this ideal has made Americans defy the “Old World” categories of settled possessiveness versus unsettling deprivation, the cupidity of retention versus the cupidity of seizure, a “status quo” defended or attacked.

- (132.) The nonstarters were considered the ones who wanted stability, a strong referee to give them some position in the race, a regulative hand to calm manic speculation; an authority that can call things to a halt, begin things again from compensatorily staggered “starting lines”.

- (133.) Reform in America has been sterile because it can imagine no change except through the extension of this metaphor of a race, wider inclusion of competitors, “a piece of the action,” as it were, for the disenfranchised.

- (134.) We have no pride in our growing interdependence, in the fact that our system can serve others, that we are able to help those in need; empty boasts from the past make us ashamed of our present achievements, make us try to forget or deny them, move away from them.

- (135.) The traditional view supposes that the upper mantle of the Earth behaves as a liquid when it is subjected to small forces for long periods and that differences in temperature under oceans and continents are sufficient to produce convection in the mantle of the Earth with rising convection currents under the mid-ocean ridges and sinking currents under the continents.

- (136.) This view may be correct: it has the advantage that the currents are driven by temperature differences that themselves depend on the position of the continents.

- (137.) The enclosed seas are an important feature of the Earth’s surface and seriously require explanation because, in addition to the enclosed seas that are developing at present behind island arcs, there are a number of older ones of possibly similar origin, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Black Sea, and perhaps the North Sea.

- (138.) Furthermore, neutrinos carry with them information about the site and circumstances of their production: therefore, the detection of cosmic neutrinos could provide new information about a wide variety of cosmic phenomena and about the history of the universe.

- (139.) Consequently, nothing seems good or normal that does not accord with the requirements of the free market.

- (140.) Accordingly, it requires a major act of will to think of price-fixing (the determination of prices by the seller) as both “normal” and having a valuable economic function.

- (141.) In fact, price-fixing is normal in all industrialized societies because the industrial system itself provides, as an effortless consequence of its own development, the price-fixing that it requires.

- (142.) That each large firm will act with consideration of its own needs and thus avoid selling its products for more than its competitors’ charge is commonly recognized by advocates of free-market economic theories.

- (143.) Moreover, those economists who argue that allowing the free market to operate without interference is the most efficient method of establishing prices have not considered the economies of nonsocialist countries other than the United States.

- (144.) Snyder, Daly, and Bruno have recently proposed that caffeine affects behavior by countering the activity in the human brain of a naturally occurring chemical called adenosine.

- (145.) To buttress their case that caffeine acts instead by preventing adenosine binding, Snyder compared the stimulatory effects of a series of caffeine derivatives with their ability to dislodge adenosine from its receptors in the brains of mice.

- (146.) The problem is that the compound has mixed effects in the brain, a not unusual occurrence with psychoactive drugs.

- (147.) Who would want an unmarked pot when another was available whose provenance was known, and that was dated stratigraphically by the professional archaeologist who excavated it?

- (148.) Federal efforts to aid minority businesses began in the 1960s when the Small Business Administration began making federally guaranteed loans and government-sponsored management and technical assistance available to minority business enterprises.

- (149.) Recently federal policymakers have adopted an approach intended to accelerate development of the minority business sector by moving away from directly aiding small minority enterprises and toward supporting larger, growth-oriented minority firms through intermediary companies.

- (150.) MESBIC’s are the result of the belief that providing established firms with easier access to relevant management techniques and more job-specific experience, as well as substantial amounts of capital, gives those firms a greater opportunity to develop sound business foundations than does simply making general management experience and small amounts of capital available.
