- (153.) During the nineteenth century, she argues, `主` #the concept# 概念 of the “useful” child /who contributed to 对……作出贡献 the family economy 经济 /`谓` *#gave way 让位给，让步给,被……取代 gradually 逐渐地 to#* the present-day 现代的；当今的 notion 观念；看法 of the “useless” child /`主` #who#, though 虽然，尽管 producing no income 收入 *for*, and indeed extremely 极其；非常 costly (a.)昂贵的 *to*, *its parents*, /`系` #is yet considered emotionally# 情感上 “priceless 无价的”.

她认为，在19世纪，为家庭经济做出贡献的“有用”儿童的概念, 逐渐被现代“无用”儿童的观念所取代，后者尽管不为父母带来收入，甚至对父母来说花费巨大，但在情感上却被认为是“无价的”。

- (154.) *Well established* among segments of the middle and upper classes by the mid-1800’s, `主` #this new view# of childhood `谓` #spread# (v.) throughout society /in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries /as `主` #reformers `谓` introduced# (v.) _child-labor regulations_ and _compulsory (a.) education laws_ /*predicated* (v.) in part *on* the assumption /that a child’s emotional value *made* (v.) child labor *taboo* (a.).

[.my1]
.案例
====
- (154.) Well established 确立的；根深蒂固的 among segments 部分；群体 of the middle and upper classes 上层阶级 by the mid-1800’s, `主` this new view of childhood `谓` spread (v.)传播；扩散 throughout society /in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries /as `主` reformers 改革者introduced (v.)推行；采用 _child-labor regulations_ 童工规定 and _compulsory 义务的；强制的 education laws_ 法律 /*predicated* (v.) 基于；取决于 in part 部分地 *on* the assumption 假设 /that a child’s emotional 情感的 value 价值 made child labor 童工 taboo (a.)禁忌的.

已经牢牢地在18世纪的中期在中产阶级和上流社会中确
立，这个新观点在19世纪末和20世纪初传遍了整个社会；当时改革
者们引入了童工法和义务教育法，其出现是部分地基于这样一个前
提，那就是孩子的感情价值使得童工被禁止。

.predicate (v.) A on/upon B  配的意思是“以B作为A的基础”, 或“依据B提出A”。

.predicate
(v.) [ VN] [ usually passive] *~ sth on/upon sth* : to base sth on a particular belief, idea or principle 使基于；使以…为依据 +
• Democracy *is predicated (v.) upon* the rule of law. 民主是以法制为基础的。

.the assumption /that a child's emotional value *made* child labor
*taboo* (a.)
在 "made child labor taboo"中，​​"taboo" 是宾语补足语(即是个 adj.)​​，用于说明 "child labor" 的状态（即 "童工被视为禁忌"）。 +
这里的 ​​"made" 是使役动词​​（类似 "make sth. + adj." 结构），因此 ​​"taboo" 必须是形容词​​，而非名词。


如果是名词，通常会写成：
"made child labor a taboo"（加冠词 "a"）但原句没有冠词，因此只能是形容词。

- (155.) ”`主` #*Expulsion*# of children *from* the ‘cash nexus’... /although clearly shaped (v.) by _profound changes_ in the economic, occupational, and family structures,” /Zelizer maintains (v.), /`系` “#was# also part of _a cultural process_ of ‘sacralization’ of children’s lives.”

[.my1]
.案例
====
- (155.) ”`主` #Expulsion# (n.)驱逐；开除,排出 of children from the ‘cash nexus (（错综复杂的）关系，联结，联系) 金钱关系’…​/although clearly shaped by 由……塑造 profound 深刻的；深远的 changes in the economic 经济的, occupational 职业的, and family structures 结构,” /插入语 Zelizer maintains (v.)主张；认为, /“`谓` #was# also part of a cultural 文化的 process 过程 of ‘sacralization 神圣化;骶骨化；[外科] 骶骨融合’ of children’s lives.”

泽利泽认为：“将儿童逐出现金关系……尽管显然受到经济、职业和家庭结构的深刻变化的影响，但它也是儿童生活‘神圣化’文化过程的一部分。”

.sacralization
n.骶骨化；[外科] 骶骨融合；神圣化

“Sacralization”这个词确实有两个看似截然不同的含义，这主要是因为它们的词源和发展路径不同. 两个词义都追溯到同一个拉丁语词根 "sacer"，这个词根本身就包含“神圣的”含义。

- 医学上的“骶骨化”直接引用了“骶骨”（sacrum）这个词，而骶骨本身在历史和文化上就被认为是“神圣的骨头”，因此“骶骨化”就是指这个“神圣的骨头”发生融合或形成的过程。

- 社会学上的“神圣化”则是直接继承了“sacer”词根的抽象含义，即“使之变得神圣、受人敬仰”。
====

- (156.) `主` Protecting children from _the crass (a.) business world_ `谓` became enormously important /for late-nineteenth-century middle-class Americans, /she suggests; /`主` this sacralization `系` was a way of resisting (v.) what they *perceived as* _the relentless (a.) corruption_ of human values by the marketplace.

- (156.) `主` *Protecting* children *from* the crass (a.)愚蠢而无同情心的 business world 商业界 /`谓` became enormously 极其；非常 important /for late-nineteenth-century middle-class 中产阶级的 Americans, /she suggests; /`主` this sacralization 神圣化  `系` was a way of resisting (v.)抵制；反对 what *they perceived 认为；看作 as* _the relentless 残酷无情的，不留情面的；不停的，不间断的 corruption_ 使人堕落的行为；腐蚀；败坏 of human values 价值观 by the marketplace 市场.

她认为，保护儿童免受庸俗商业世界的侵蚀, 对于19世纪晚期的美国中产阶级来说, 变得极其重要；这种神圣化, 是抵制他们所认为的"市场对人类价值观无情腐蚀"的一种方式。

.crass
(a.) very stupid and showing no sympathy or understanding 愚蠢而无同情心的
SYN insensitive
•_the crass (a.) questions_ 后定说明 all _disabled (a.)丧失能力的，有残疾的 people_ **get asked** 所有残疾人, 都会碰到的愚蠢而缺乏同情心的提问
•an act of _crass (a.) (= great) stupidity_ 愚不可及的行为

- (157.) `主` The factors 后定说明 favoring (v.) unionization drives /`谓` seem to have been #either# the presence of large numbers of workers, as in New York City, to make it worth the effort, #or# the concentration of small numbers in one or two locations, such as a hospital, to make it relatively easy.

- (157.) `主` The factors 因素 后定说明 favoring (v.)有利于；支持 unionization 工会化 drives 运动 /`谓` seem to have been #either# the presence 存在 of large numbers of workers, as in New York City, to make it worth the effort 努力, #or# the concentration 集中 of small numbers in one or two locations 地点, such as a hospital, to make it relatively 相对地 easy.

促成工会化运动的因素, 似乎要么是存在大量工人，如在纽约市，使之值得付出努力，要么是少数工人集中在一两个地方，如医院，使之相对容易。

（有利于工会组织形成的）因素看起来或者是大量的工人的出
现，比如在纽约这样的城市，（使得这种努力值得）；或者是少量的集中
（于一两个地方的人，比如医院这种地方），（使其相对较为容易）。

- (158.) `主` Individual entrepreneurs `谓` do not necessarily *rely on* their kin /because they cannot obtain (v.) _financial backing_ from commercial resources.

[.my1]

====
- (158.) Individual entrepreneurs 企业家 do not necessarily *rely on*  their kin 亲属 /because they cannot obtain (v.) financial  backing (n.)支持 from commercial 商业的 resources.

人企业主不一定是因为他们不能从商业机构那里得到财政支
持，才去依赖他们的亲属的。

注意: 千万不要理解成: 因为个人企业主们不能从商业机构那里得到财政支持，所以他们不一
定去依赖他们的亲属。 这样句意就变得荒谬了.

- (159.) Since `主` large bees `谓` are not affected by the spraying of Matacil, `主` these results `谓` *add weight to* the argument /that `主` #spraying# _where the pollinators *are sensitive to* the pesticide 后定说明 used_ `谓` #decreases# (v.) plant fecundity.

鉴于"大型蜜蜂不受马塔西尔喷洒"的影响，这些结果进一步证实了这样的论点：在传粉者对"所用杀虫剂敏感的区域"进行喷洒，会降低植物的繁殖力。

- the argument后面一直到本句结束, 都是 argument 的同位语从句；
- 从句中的主语 spraying 之后, 又带了一个 where 引导的状语从句，
- 其中的最后一个单词 used, 是前面的 pesticide的定语，意思是被使用的杀虫剂。

- (161.) Although at first the colonies held little positive attraction for the English—they would rather have stayed home—by the eighteenth century people increasingly migrated to America because they regarded it as the land of opportunity.

- (161.) Although at first `主` the colonies 殖民地 `谓` held little positive 积极的 attraction 吸引力 for the English — they would rather 宁愿 have stayed home — by the eighteenth century /`主` people `谓` increasingly 越来越多地 *migrated (v.) to* 迁移到 America /because they *regarded 认为 it as* the land of opportunity 机遇之地.

尽管最初这些殖民地对英国人几乎没有什么积极的吸引力——他们宁愿待在家里——但到了18世纪，人们越来越多地移民到美洲，因为他们将其视为充满机会的土地。

.they would rather have stayed home
这里的 ​​"would rather have stayed"​​ 是 ​​##**"would rather" + 完成时（have + 过去分词）​​ 的结构，表示 ​​对过去情况的虚拟或后悔​​，**##即 ​​"（当时）宁愿留在英国，但事实上还是去了殖民地"​​。


"would rather" 的两种主要用法：​​

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|① 表示##"现在"或"将来"的偏好##（一般现在时）​
|- ​​结构​​：#would rather + 动词原形#
- ​​例句​​：
They would rather stay home.（他们宁愿待在家里。）→ ​​现在或未来的选择​​

|②表示##对"过去"的虚拟或后悔（完成时）##​​
|- ​​结构​​：#would rather + have + 过去分词#
- ​例句​​：
They would rather have stayed home.（他们宁愿当初留在家里。）→ ​​过去的选择，但事实相反​
|===


为什么这里用完成时？​​ +
原句：
"Although at first the colonies held little positive attraction for the English—*they would rather have stayed home*—by the eighteenth century people increasingly migrated to America..."


前半句讲的是 ​​*早期（17世纪）​​ 英国人对殖民地的态度——​​"当时并不太想去"​​。
但事实上，他们还是去了（否则不会有后来的移民潮）。*

所以 ​​"would rather have stayed home"​​ 表达的是 ​​"（当时）宁愿留在英国，但实际没留"​​，是一种 ​​对过去的虚拟或后悔​​。


如果不用完成时，意思会怎样？​​ +
"they would rather stay home" 这样会变成 ​​"他们现在宁愿待在家"​ +
"I would rather *go* now."（我现在宁愿走。）→ ​​现在/未来​​ +
"I would rather *have gone* yesterday."（我宁愿昨天就走了。）→ ​​过去​​（但事实没走）

如果竞争对手能够证明进口商品造成了损害——并且美国公司从外国政府获得了补贴以在国外建厂——那么这家美国公司的产品在美国将不具竞争力，因为它们将面临关税。

如果竞争者能够证明受到了进口的伤害——而且能够证明美国

那么如果日本在美国的分公司, 能够证明它受到了美国在日本的分公司生产

- (151.) Most senior executives are familiar with the formal decision analysis models, and those who use such systematic methods for reaching decisions are occasionally leery of solutions suggested by these methods which run counter to their sense of the correct course of action.

- (152.) But the debate could not be resolved because no one was able to ask the crucial questions in a form in which they could be pursued productively.

- (153.) During the nineteenth century, she argues, the concept of the “useful” child who contributed to the family economy gave way gradually to the present-day notion of the “useless” child who, though producing no income for, and indeed extremely costly to, its parents, is yet considered emotionally “priceless”.

- (154.) Well established among segments of the middle and upper classes by the mid-1800’s, this new view of childhood spread throughout society in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries as reformers introduced child-labor regulations and compulsory education laws predicated in part on the assumption that a child’s emotional value made child labor taboo.

- (155.) ”Expulsion of children from the ‘cash nexus’...although clearly shaped by profound changes in the economic, occupational, and family structures,” Zelizer maintains, “was also part of a cultural process of ‘sacralization’ of children’s lives.”

- (156.) Protecting children from the crass business world became enormously important for late-nineteenth-century middle-class Americans, she suggests; this sacralization was a way of resisting what they perceived as the relentless corruption of human values by the marketplace.

- (157.) The factors favoring unionization drives seem to have been either the presence of large numbers of workers, as in New York City, to make it worth the effort, or the concentration of small numbers in one or two locations, such as a hospital, to make it relatively easy.

- (158.) Individual entrepreneurs do not necessarily rely on their kin because they cannot obtain financial backing from commercial resources.

- (159.) Since large bees are not affected by the spraying of Matacil, these results add weight to the argument that spraying where the pollinators are sensitive to the pesticide used decreases plant fecundity.

- (160.) The question of whether the decrease in plant fecundity caused by the spray of pesticides actually causes a decline in the overall population of flowering plant species still remains unanswered.

- (161.) Although at first the colonies held little positive attraction for the English—they would rather have stayed home—by the eighteenth century people increasingly migrated to America because they regarded it as the land of opportunity.

- (162.) If the competitor can prove injury from the imports—and that the United States company received a subsidy from a foreign government to build its plant abroad—the United States company’s products will be uncompetitive in the United States, since they would be subject to duties.

- (163.) In addition, many ethnologists at the turn of the century believed that Native American manners and customs were rapidly disappearing, and that it was important to preserve for posterity as much information as could be adequately recorded before the cultures disappeared forever.

- (164.) In such a context, what is recognized as “dependency” in Western psychiatric terms is not, in Korean terms, an admission of weakness or failure.

- (165.) And managers under pressure to maximize cost-cutting will resist innovation because they know that more fundamental changes in processes or systems will wreak havoc with the results on which they are measured.

- (166.) Most novelists and historians writing in the early to mid-twentieth century who considered women in the West, when they considered women at all, fell under Turner’s spell.

- (167.) In addition, the ideal of six CEOs (female or male) serving on the board of each of the largest corporations is realizable only if every CEO serves on six boards.

- (168.) Increasingly, historians are blaming diseases imported from the Old World for the staggering disparity between the indigenous population of America in 1492—new estimates of which soar as high as 100 million, or approximately one-sixth of the human race at that time—and the few million full-blooded Native Americans alive at the end of nineteenth century.

- (169.) Virgin-soil epidemics are those in which the populations at risk have had no previous contact with the diseases that strike them and are therefore immunologically almost defenseless.

- (170.) The evidence provided by the documents of British and French colonies is not as definitive because the conquerors of those areas did not establish permanent settlements and begin to keep continuous records until the seventeenth century, by which time the worst epidemics had probably taken place.

- (171.) Unfortunately, the documentation of these and other epidemics is slight and frequently unreliable, and it is necessary to supplement what little we do know with evidence from recent epidemics among Native Americans.

- (172.) Scientists have begun to suspect that this intergalactic gas is probably a mixture of gases left over from the “big bang” when the galaxies were formed and gas was forced out of galaxies by supernova explosions.

- (173.) He noted that the wavelengths of the radiation emitted by a gas would change as the gas cooled, so that as the gas flowed into the galaxy and became cooler, it would emit not x-rays, but visible light, like that which was captured in the photographs.

- (174.) Transported outside the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the mRNA is translated into the protein it encodes by an organelle known as a ribosome, which strings together amino acids in the order specified by the sequence of elements in the mRNA molecule.

- (175.) However, recent investigations have shown that the concentrations of most mRNAs correlate best, not with their synthesis rate, but rather with the equally variable rates at which cells degrade the different mRNAs in their cytoplasm.

- (176.) If a cell degrades both a rapidly and a slowly synthesized mRNA slowly, both mRNAs will accumulate to high levels.

- (177.) For instance, the mass-production philosophy of United States automakers encouraged the production of huge lots of cars in order to utilize fully expensive, component-specific equipment and to occupy fully workers who have been trained to execute one operation efficiently.

- (178.) Japanese automakers chose to make small-lot production feasible by introducing the use of flexible equipment that could be altered easily to do several different production tasks and the training of workers in multiple jobs.

- (179.) Automakers could schedule the production of different components or models on single machines, thereby eliminating the need to store the buffer stocks of extra components that result when specialized equipment and workers are kept constantly active.

- (180.) In recent studies, however, we have discovered that the production and release in brain neurons of the neurotransmitter serotonin (neurotransmitters are compounds that neurons use to transmit signals to other cells) depend directly on the food that the body processes.

- (181.) Our first studies sought to determine whether the increase in serotonin observed in rats given a large injection of the amino acid tryptophan might also occur after rats ate meals that change tryptophan levels in the blood.
