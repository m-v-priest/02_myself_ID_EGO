此外，某些黑人小说的风格（如琼·图默的《甘蔗》）近乎"表现主义"或"超现实主义"；这种技巧是否与主流主题形成对位？该主题常以更"自然主义"的表现方式，描绘黑人英雄与之抗争的命运。

.verge (v.) on sth
(v.) to be very close to an extreme state or condition 极接近；濒于
SYN border on sth
•Some of his suggestions *verged on* the outrageous. 他的一些建议都快到了荒唐的地步。

.counterpoint
(n.) [ UC] ( formal ) a pleasing or interesting contrast 惬意（或有趣）的对比 +
• This work is _in austere (a.)朴实的，质朴的 counterpoint_ (n.) to that of Gaudi. 这件作品的质朴风格, 与高迪的, 形成了有趣的对比。

[ C]( music 音) *~ (to sth)* : a tune /played *in combination with* another one 复调

Counterpoint (对位/对照)： +
源自音乐术语，*指不同旋律线并行发展, 但相互协调。* +
在文学语境中，它表示两种不同元素之间的并置、对照或补充关系。这种对照不是单纯的对比，而是通过并列来增强彼此的意义，或产生更深层次的效果。

.pit
(v.) *#pit# sb/sth #against# sth* : +
to test sb or their strength, intelligence, etc. in a struggle or contest against sb/sth else 使竞争；使较量；使经受考验 +
•Lawyers and accountants felt that /they were *being pitted against* each other. 律师和会计师都觉得, 他们要一争高下。 +
•a chance /*to pit (v.) your wits against* the world champions (= in a test of your intelligence)  一次与世界冠军斗智的机会

.Expressionism (表现主义)：
一种20世纪初的艺术运动，起源于德国。 +
核心特点：*艺术家不追求客观再现外部世界，而是通过扭曲、夸张、抽象的形式来表达内在的情感、主观感受和精神状态。#它强调个人对世界的内在体验和心理现实，而非外部客观现实。#* +
*在文学中，表现主义作品可能具有碎片化的叙事、象征性的意象、梦境般的场景，以及对人物内心痛苦和焦虑的深刻描绘。*

.Surrealism (超现实主义)：
一种20世纪初的艺术运动，起源于法国，受到弗洛伊德精神分析理论的影响。 +
核心特点：*旨在释放潜意识的创造力，通过梦境、幻觉、非理性、无意识的并置来表现现实。它常常将看似无关的元素并置在一起，创造出既荒诞又具有深刻心理意义的画面。* +
在文学中，*超现实主义作品可能具有跳跃性的思维联结、非线性的叙事、象征性和隐喻大量运用，以及对梦境、无意识冲动的探索。*

.Naturalistic modes of expression (自然主义的表达方式)：
*自然主义 (Naturalism)* 是一种文学流派，#*是"现实主义"的极端形式。*# +
核心特点：**##强调客观、细致地描绘现实，包括其丑陋和残酷的一面，常常揭示社会环境和遗传因素对人性的决定性影响。##它倾向于描绘社会底层人物的悲惨命运，认为人是受环境和本能驱使的。 **+
#*“自然主义的表达方式”意味着使用写实、直接、不加修饰的语言和叙事手法, 来呈现事实(不回避残酷)，就像科学观察一样。*#

.Gemini 的解说:
一些黑人小说，比如让·图默的《甘蔗》，其写作风格（表现主义或超现实主义）非常规、不写实，这就提出一个问题： +
这种"非写实"的艺术手法，是否与通常以"写实主义"方式表现的、描绘黑人英雄挣扎和对抗悲惨命运的普遍主题，形成了一种相互补充或对比的关系？

传统上，描绘黑人苦难和抗争命运的作品，多采用写实手法，直接呈现残酷现实。
但像《甘蔗》这样采用表现主义或超现实主义（强调内在、梦境、扭曲现实）的作品，是如何处理这个主题的？

*这种非写实手法，是增强了这个主题（通过更深层次地揭示心理创伤或生存困境）？还是提供了一种不同的视角（通过艺术的扭曲, 来反映现实的荒诞和压迫，或者提供一种超越现实的希望）？它是否提供了一种独特的视角或力量，来回应黑人所面对的残酷命运？* +
简而言之，这句话是在探讨形式（非写实）与内容（挣扎命运）之间的复杂互动关系。

- 303. `主` Studies by Hargrave and Geen `谓`  estimated (v.)估计，估算 natural community 自然群落 _grazing rates_ 牧食率 /by #measuring# (v.) _feeding rates_ 摄食率 of _individual zooplankton (n.)浮游动物 species_ in the laboratory /#and then computing# (v.) _community grazing rates_ 群落放牧率 for  _field conditions_ 野外条件,现场条件 /using (v.) the known (a.) population density 种群密度 of grazers 食草动物(这里特指 浮游动物).

哈格雷夫和吉恩的研究通过测量实验室中单个浮游动物物种的摄食率，再结合已知的食草动物种群密度推算野外条件下的群落摄食率，从而估算了自然群落的 grazing rates（摄食强度）。




.natural community grazing rates（自然群落放牧率）：
下面的结合起来，自然群落放牧率, 就是指在一个自然水体（如湖泊、海洋）中，所有不同种类的放牧者（这里主要是浮游动物）共同消耗其食物（主要是浮游植物）的总速度。

- ##**放牧率（Grazing rate）：指消费者（捕食者）单位时间内, 捕食或摄食其食物（猎物或植物）的速度。**##对于水生生态系统，通常指的是浮游动物消耗藻类或其他微小颗粒的速度。

- #*群落（Community）*#：在生态学中，#*指在同一特定区域内, 共同生活的所有不同物种的种群的总和。*#

- 自然（Natural）：强调研究的是在自然环境中发生的真实情况，而不是实验室里受控的、可能不完全真实的条件。

.feeding rates of individual zooplankton species（单个浮游动物物种的摄食率）：

- #*摄食率（Feeding rate）*#：与"放牧率"类似，#*指单个生物体, 单位时间内摄取食物的量。*#

- 浮游动物（Zooplankton）：水生生态系统中的小型动物，通常是微小的甲壳类动物或原生动物，它们漂浮在水中，以浮游植物（藻类）或其他更小的浮游动物为食。它们在水生食物网中扮演着重要的消费者角色。

- 单个物种（individual species）：在本句中. 指研究的对象, 是浮游动物中的具体某一种类，而不是混合的群落。


.computing (v.) _community grazing rates_ for _field conditions_（计算野外条件下的群落放牧率）：

计算（Computing）：根据已知数据进行推算。 +
野外条件（Field conditions）：指实际的自然环境，如湖泊、海洋，而不是受控的实验室环境。野外条件通常更为复杂和多变，包含许多实验室无法模拟的因素。

.known (a.) _population density_ of grazers （已知的放牧者种群密度）：

- ##**种群密度（Population density）：指单位面积或单位体积内, 某个物种的个体数量。**##在这里，指在自然水体中, 每单位体积（例如每升）有多少个浮游动物个体。

- 放牧者（Grazers）：这里特指"浮游动物"，因为它们是主要的“放牧者”，以浮游植物为食。

.Gemini 的解说
这句话描述了Hargrave和Geen 估算自然环境中, 浮游动物"整体捕食藻类速度"的间接方法：

- 第一步（实验室测量）：他们首先在实验室的受控条件下，精确测量了每一种特定浮游动物个体（例如某种特定的桡足类或枝角类）, 在单位时间内, 能吃掉多少食物（即它们的"摄食率"）。

- 第二步（野外推算）：然后，他们将实验室中测得的单个物种的"摄食率"数据，与在自然野外水体中实际观测到的各种浮游动物的“数量”（即它们的种群密度）结合起来。

- 第三步（计算总和）：通过将每种浮游动物的"个体摄食率", 乘以该物种在野外的数量，再将所有物种的摄食量加总，他们就能够推算出整个浮游动物群落, 在一个自然水体中, 总共消耗了多少食物（即"自然群落放牧率"）。

简而言之，这项研究没有直接在野外测量"整个浮游动物群落"的捕食速度（这通常很困难），而是通过“化整为零”的方法：先在可控的实验室里, 测量单个组件（单个物种的摄食能力），然后结合野外实际的组件数量（种群密度），来推算出整体（群落放牧率）在自然条件下的表现。

- 305. `主` #The idea# of _an autonomous 自治的，有自治权的；自主的 discipline_ 知识领域；（尤指大学的）学科，科目 called “philosophy” /*distinct (a.)截然不同的；有区别的；不同种类的 from* and *sitting (v.) in judgment 坐在审判席上评判 on*  #such# pursuits 追求、研究的领域  #as# theology 神学 and science 诸如……之类的学科,领域 /`系` #*turns out*#, (插入语，本句此处表示条件或方式) on close examination 仔细考察后, #*to be*# of quite recent (a.) origin 起源较晚.

细究之下，那种将"哲学"视为独立学科, 并与神学、科学等分庭抗礼的观念，其实是非常晚近才出现的。

.and *sitting in judgment (n.) on* such pursuits as theology and science
​"Sitting in judgment on"​​ 是一个英语习语，字面意思是“坐在审判席上评判”，但实际使用时具有比喻意义。

​*"Sit in judgment"​​：
直译为“坐在审判席上”，源自法庭场景，指法官或陪审团对案件进行裁决。* +
​​*介词 "on"​​：
表示评判的对象*（如 "on something/someone"）。

*在非法律语境中，这个短语表示：
​​“以权威或居高临下的姿态对某事/某人进行评判”.​*​

philosophy /*distinct from* and *sitting in judgment (n.)  on* such pursuits as theology and science +
哲学作为一种与神学、科学等不同, 并​​"凌驾于其上进行评判"​​的学科 +
这里的意思是：
哲学被描述为一种​​超越其他学科（如神学、科学）​​，并对其​​内容、方法或价值, 进行权威性评判​​的领域，仿佛哲学是“真理的终极仲裁者”。

例句:

- "Historians should avoid *sitting in judgment (n.) on* past cultures by modern standards."
（历史学家应避免用现代标准,​​居高临下地评判​​过去的文化。）
- "She always *sits in judgment (n.) on* her colleagues' life choices."
（她总喜欢​​指手画脚地评判​​同事的人生选择。）

该短语通常含​​负面色彩​​，暗示评判者可能​​自以为是​​或​​缺乏同理心​​。

.“philosophy” /*distinct (a.) from* and *sitting (v.) in judgment on* _such pursuits as_ theology and science
​​"such"​​（这样的） + ​​"pursuits"​​（追求、研究的领域） + ​​"as"​​（例如） +
→ ​​*"#such# pursuits #as#"​​ = ​​“诸如……之类的学科/领域”*​​ +
​​"theology and science"​​ 是 ​​"pursuits"​​ 的具体例子，表示“神学和科学这类研究领域”。

#"pursuits"​​ 在这里指 ​​“学术或智力探索的领域”​​（类似 "fields of study"）。# +
​​*"such...as"​​ 是英语中 ​​举例说明​​ 的经典结构，相当于 ​​“像……这样的”​​ 或 ​​“例如……”​​。*

类似表达:​​ +
​​"such fields as"​​（诸如……之类的领域） +
​​"such disciplines as"​​（诸如……之类的学科） +
​​"such subjects as"​​（诸如……之类的主题） +

- 306. Yet `主` Walzer's #argument#, however deficient (a.)不足的；有缺点的, `谓` #does 表强调 *point to*# one of the most serious weaknesses of capitalism 资本主义 —namely 即, that it (指代 capitalism) *#brings to#* predominant 明显的；占主导地位的，占支配地位的;主导的 positions 使…占据主导地位;让…成为社会中的掌权者 in a society /#people# /who, no matter 不论，不管 how legitimately 合法地 they have earned (v.) their material rewards 物质奖励, often lack (v.) those other qualities /that evoke (v.)唤起 affection 爱戴（情感上的）;喜爱，关爱；爱恋，爱慕之情  or admiration 钦佩（能力/品德上的）.

然而沃尔泽的论点虽不完善，却确实指出了资本主义最严重的缺陷之一：它使那些"物质成就虽合法, 但缺乏唤起爱戴或钦佩之品质的人", 占据社会主导地位。

尽管Walzer的观点存在缺陷，但是它确实指出了资本主义社会的一个非常严重的缺点，那就是在资本主义社会中，占据社会显要位置的人, 往往缺乏能唤起别人对其爱慕和崇拜的品质，不论这群人获取物质财富的手段有多么合法。

. it *brings to* predominant positions in a society *people* who, no matter how...
我的提问:
这里面是不是有个倒装? 正常语序是不是  it brings people  to predominant positions in a society who, no matter how

deepseek的回答:  +
​这个句子确实存在倒装现象​​，它属于​​宾语后置​​（宾语+修饰成分过长时，将修饰部分后移以避免头重脚轻）

原句倒装部分​​：
"it brings ​​to predominant positions in a society​​ (介词短语作地点状语) ​​people who...​​ (宾语+定语从句)"
（直译：它把​​到社会主导地位​​ ​​这样一群人…​​）

​​正常语序应为​​：
"*it brings ​​people /who*...​​ (宾语+定语从句) ​​/*to* predominant positions in a society​​ (状语)"
（它把​​这样一群人…​​ 推向​​社会主导地位​​）

#*"宾语后置"仿写公式​​：
"主语 + 谓语 + 状语 + 宾语（带长定语从句）"*#

为什么使用倒装/后置？​​
​​避免头重脚轻​​ +
宾语 "people" 后面跟着超长的定语从句（"who, no matter how..., often lack..."），如果按正常语序，句子的核心意思会因修饰成分过长, 而模糊。

- 正常语序（读起来吃力）：
"it *brings* _people /who, no matter how legitimately they have earned..., often lack..."_ *to* predominant positions.
-  倒装后（更清晰）：
"it *brings to* predominant positions _people /who_..."
​​强调状语​​：

- 将 "to predominant positions" 提前，可以突出资本主义“将人推向高位”这一动作的重要性。


类似例句（宾语后置结构）​:

- The teacher *assigned ​​to* the struggling students​​ ​​_extra homework_ /that required hours of research​​.
（老师给​​学困生​​布置了​​需要数小时研究的额外作业​​。）
- "The company *promoted ​​to* leadership roles​​ ​​_employees /who_, despite lacking experience, showed exceptional creativity​​."
（公司把​​缺乏经验但极具创造力​​的员工提拔​​到领导岗位​​。）

肖的革命性"开放系统"观点, 认为地球与地外动力学, 存在连续性，而现代板块构造理论, 如同19世纪发展的经典地质学，基于地球地质特征通过地球固有的渐进规律过程改变的观点，不涉及特殊灾变事件。


Shaw具有革命性的“开放系统”观点, 承认了地球和地球外的动力学的连续统一性，而现代板块构造理论——正如同发展于19世纪的"经典地质学"那样——建立在这样一种观点之上：地球的地理特征是在连续的、规律的地球内在过程中变化的，而没有记录特殊的灾难性的事件。

•Small local shops *are intrinsic (a.) to* the town's character. 本地的一些小店铺是这个镇的基本特点。 +

.Shaw's revolutionary “open-system” view (肖的革命性“开放系统”观点)：
Open-system (开放系统)：在科学中，##**一个系统如果与"外部环境", 有物质或能量的交换，就被称为"开放系统"。在这里，“开放系统”的地球观, 意味着地球地质过程, 不仅仅受地球内部因素影响，还会受到地球外部（例如宇宙空间）因素的影响。**##这种观点被描述为“革命性”，表明它挑战了传统的、封闭的地球观。

.terrestrial and extraterrestrial dynamics (地内动力学和地外动力学)：

- *Terrestrial dynamics (地内动力学)：指地球内部的运动和过程，例如地幔对流、板块运动、火山活动、地震等，这些都驱动着地球表面的地质变化。*

- *Extraterrestrial dynamics (地外动力学)：指地球外部、宇宙空间中的力量和过程, 对地球的影响，例如小行星撞击、太阳活动、宇宙射线、月球引力（潮汐力）等。*

.modern plate tectonic theory (现代板块构造理论)：

这是当代地质学最核心、最成功的理论之一。它解释了地球表面的大陆和海洋, 如何通过巨大岩石板块（地壳和上地幔的组合，称为岩石圈）的缓慢运动, 而形成和演变。这些板块在地球深部对流力的驱动下, 相互作用，导致地震、火山、山脉形成、海沟等现象。

尽管**"现代板块构造理论"**是理解地球地质演化的基石，但在这句话的语境中，**它被归类为“内在过程”的范畴，**即强调地球内部动力对地质变化的驱动。


.classical geology developed during the nineteenth century (19世纪发展的经典地质学)：

指的是19世纪地质学的主流观点，特别是均变论（Uniformitarianism）。

.gradual, regular processes /intrinsic  (a.) to Earth (地球固有的、渐进的、规律性的过程)：

- Gradual, regular processes (渐进的、规律性的过程)：这是"均变论"的核心思想。*#"均变论"认为，作用于今天的地质过程（如风化、侵蚀、沉积、火山活动等）, 在过去也以同样的方式和速度进行，而且这些过程是缓慢而持续的。它与"灾变论"（Catastrophism）相对。#*

- Intrinsic (a.) to Earth (地球固有的)：强调这些过程是地球内部或本身所产生的，不涉及"外部因素"。

.unique catastrophic events (独特的灾难性事件)：

- 指突然的、大规模的、非重复性的、具有重大影响的地质事件。例如： +
大规模小行星或彗星撞击地球。 +
超级火山爆发导致全球性气候变化。 +
极端的地磁逆转。 +

- *#灾变论（Catastrophism）就认为, 地球地质特征, 是由这些大规模的灾难性事件塑造的。#*

.Gemini 的解说:

这句话主要对比了两种关于地球地质演化的观点：肖（Shaw）的“开放系统”观点和现代板块构造理论（以及19世纪的经典地质学）。*核心分歧在于, 是否考虑地球之外的因素以及灾难性事件, 对地球地质变化的长期影响。*

这句话旨在对比两种截然不同的"地球观"和"地质演化理论"：

- **肖（Shaw）的“革命性开放系统”观点认为： 地球的地质过程和特征, 不仅仅受到地球内部（地内）动力学的影响，还应该将地球外部（地外）动力学纳入考量范围。**换句话说，地球不是一个孤立的系统，它与宇宙环境是相互作用的，甚至可能被一些独特的、灾难性的外部事件所影响。这种观点拓宽了我们理解地球历史的视野。

- *##相对而言，"现代板块构造理论"（以及19世纪的经典地质学，尤其是"均变论"）则认为： 地球的地质特征和变化, 主要是由地球本身固有的、渐进的、规律性的过程（如板块运动、风化侵蚀等）所驱动的。这些理论, 倾向于不考虑或较少关注那些独特的、灾难性的外部事件（例如大型小行星撞击）在地球地质演化中的作用。##它们更强调地球内部稳定而持续的力量。*

- Consistent (一致的)：指在作品或某个文化语境中，某个符号是否总是代表相同的意义，没有歧义。

- thornier matter (更棘手的问题)

这部分是在讨论，在某些艺术或文学作品中，作者（或创作者）赋予符号意义时，是有意让这种象征意义非常明确和一贯，还是更含蓄、更开放解读。作者认为这本身就是个“棘手”的问题。

另外, 这里并没有倒装句存在. 因为 ##**当用 how 引导从句时，形容词需紧接疑问词，形成 ​​“How + 形容词 + 主语 + 谓语”​​ 的语序，**##这是英语的常规规则，​​并非倒装​​。

.but anyone /who has *more* #familiarity# *than* a _passing acquaintance_ /#with# Dutch literature /#or with# the kinds of images 后定说明 used in _illustrated books_ (above all _emblem books_)

- passing acquaintance (泛泛之交/初步了解)

- Dutch literature (荷兰文学)：
特指荷兰语地区（主要是17世纪荷兰黄金时代）的文学作品。这个时期的荷兰艺术（如绘画）也以其丰富的象征意义而闻名，尤其是日常物品中蕴含的道德或宗教寓意。

- illustrated books (插图本)：
指包含插画（图片）的书籍。在早期现代欧洲，插图本非常流行，插图往往不仅仅是装饰，更是文本意义的补充或延伸。

- emblem (n.) books (象征画集/寓意画册)：
它们是16世纪到18世纪欧洲非常流行的一种特殊的插图本。
它们通常由三部分组成： +
-> Motto/Inscriptio (题铭/箴言)：一句简短的格言或标题。 +
-> Pictura/Icon (图像)：一幅象征性的插画。 +
-> Subscriptio (释文/诗歌)：一段文字（通常是诗歌）来解释图像和题铭所蕴含的道德、宗教或哲学寓意。 +
象征画集, 旨在教育和启发读者，通过图像和文字的结合, 来传达特定的道德教训或智慧。它们的特点是"高度的象征性"，其中的图像通常不是字面意义上的描绘，而是深具含义的符号。

.but anyone ...   will know how much #less# pervasive was the habit of investing ordinary objects #than# of investing scenes with meaning that go beyond their surface and outward appearance.


.habit of investing (v.)投资;使似乎具备某性质 ordinary objects (将意义赋予普通物品的习惯)：

指艺术家或作家, 习惯性地在日常生活中常见的物品中, 嵌入深层意义（例如，一只漏水的沙漏象征时间的流逝和生命的短暂）。这在17世纪荷兰静物画中非常常见。

investing (v.) scenes with meaning that go beyond their surface and outward appearance (将意义赋予场景，使其超越其表面和外在表现)：

指将一个完整的画面、一个事件、一个情境赋予更深层次的、超越其表象的意义。例如，一幅描绘家庭日常生活的画作，可能不仅仅是写实，更蕴含着对家庭美德、秩序或道德堕落的象征意义。




.how much #less# pervasive (a.) *was the habit* of investing ordinary objects #than# of investing scenes with meaning that go beyond their surface and outward appearance.

- how much less pervasive *was the habit of* ...
#这里用了倒装结构，正常语序应为 "how much less pervasive *the habit was*..."#

- 比较结构​​："*less* pervasive... *than*..."（不如……普遍）

.Gemini 的解说:

第一部分：“How explicit and consistent the symbolizing process was intended to be is a much thornier matter...”

这句话的作者首先指出，在艺术和文学作品中，一个象征过程被创作者设计得有多么明确和一贯（即是否很容易被读者一眼看出其深层含义，以及其含义是否总是固定不变），这本身就是一个非常复杂且难以界定或回答的问题。言外之意，这并不是一个简单的是非题。

第二部分：“...but anyone who has more familiarity than a passing acquaintance with Dutch literature or with the kinds of images used in illustrated books (above all emblem books) will know how much less pervasive was the habit of investing ordinary objects than of investing scenes with meaning that go beyond their surface and outward appearance.”

然而，话锋一转，作者提出了自己的观点。他认为，任何对荷兰文学或插图本（尤其是象征画集）有深入了解的人，都会明白： +
在那个时期，将深层意义嵌入到单个“普通物品”中的习惯，远不如将深层意义嵌入到整个“场景”中那么普遍。

综合起来，这句话的意思是：

要准确判断一个象征过程在艺术创作中被设计得有多么明确和一贯，这是一个非常复杂的问题。但是，只要你对荷兰文学和插图本（特别是象征画集）有较深入的了解，你就会发现，那个时代（尤其是17世纪）的创作者，更倾向于通过整个画面或场景, 来传递超越表象的深层意义，而不是仅仅通过单个的日常物品, 来承载这种复杂的象征意义。

换句话说，作者认为在那个时代的荷兰艺术和文学中，象征意义的承载, 更多体现在宏大的叙事场景或情境层面，而不是微观到每一个独立的日常物品上。

Because his work concentrates on the nineteenth century, McLaughlin unfortunately overlooks earlier sources of influence, such as eighteen-century White resident traders and neighbors, thus obscuring the relative impact of the missionaries of the 1820s in contributing to both acculturalization and resistance to it among the Cherokee.

- 313. Although iridium is extremely rare on the Earth's surface, the lower regions of the Earth's mantle have roughly the same composition as meteorites and contain large amounts of iridium, which in the case of a diapir eruption would probably be emitted as iridium hexafluoride, a gas that would disperse more uniformly in the atmosphere than the iridium-containing matter thrown out from a meteorite impact.

- 314. 3. One reason is the historical tendency, which has persisted into the twentieth century, to view scientific discovery as resulting from momentary flashes of individual insight rather than from extended periods of cooperative work by individuals with varying levels of knowledge and skill.

- 315. These historians seem to find allies in certain philosophers of science who argue that scientific views are not imposed by reality but are free inventions of creative minds, and that scientific claims are never more than brave conjectures, always subject to inevitable future falsification.

- 326. A critique of Handlin's interpretation of why legal slavery did not appear until the 1660s suggests that assumptions about the relation between slavery and racial prejudice should be reexamined, and that explanations for the different treatment of Black slaves in North and South America should be expanded.

- 327.

- 334. 3. This doctrine has broadened the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to other nonracial forms of discrimination, for while some justices have refused to find any legislative classification other than race to be constitutionally disfavored, most have been receptive to arguments that at least some nonracial discriminations, sexual discrimination in particular, are “suspect” and deserve this heightened scrutiny by the courts.

- 335. The isotopic composition of lead often varies from one source of common copper ore to another, with variations exceeding the measurement error; and preliminary studies indicate virtually uniform is isotopic composition of the lead from a single copper-ore source.

- 336. It is not known how rare this resemblance is, or whether it is most often seen in inclusions of silicates such as garnet, whose crystallography is generally somewhat similar to that of diamond; but when present, the resemblance is regarded as compelling evidence that the diamonds and inclusions are truly co-genetic.
