- 251. `主` The broad language of the amendment 修正，修订之处；美国宪法修正案 `谓` strongly suggests that /`主` its framers 组成者；筹划者 `谓` were proposing 打算；希冀；计划;提议 to write (v.) into the Constitution —*not* _a laundry 待洗（或正在洗涤、洗完）的衣物 list 一长串 of_ specific civil rights 公民权利 /*but* a principle of equal citizenship /that *forbids* (v.)禁止，不允许 organized (a.) society *from* *treating* (v.) any individual *as* a member of _an inferior  次的，较差的；低等的，下级的；自卑的 class_.

修正案言辞宽泛，这强烈暗示了立法者并不是试图将"一系列具体的公民权"写入宪法，而是试图将"保证每位公民都享有相同的公民权"这条原则, 写进宪法，这可以禁止有组织的社会, 将任何个人当做"下等阶级"中的成员来对待。

这主要归功于华托友人们的经营——他们在他去世后不久便组织印刷了其大部分作品（包括绘画与素描）的雕版复制品，使得华托的全部艺术产出变得且持续比任何其他艺术家更易获取，直至20世纪"带照片的艺术专论"出现。

这在很大程度上, 是由于Watteau的朋友们的进取精神。他们在Watteau去世之后，就马上组织大批量印刷Watteau的版画复制品，其中包括他的油画和素描画。因此，相较于其他任何一位艺术家，Watteau的所有艺术作品变得更易被大众接受，并且在20世纪配有照片的艺术专题著作到来之前, 一直如此。

并不是因为这样一种解释一定会僵化成一种理论，（虽然这部小说或者任何一部小说僵硬化的解释, 都不可取），而是因为《呼啸山庄》中有许多不顺从的元素，这些元素具有不容否认的力量，使得那种试图囊括一切的解释, 无力解释《呼啸山庄》。

这并非因为此类解读必然会僵化成定论（尽管对这部或任何小说的阐释, 都难免陷入僵化的风险），而是因为《呼啸山庄》具有难以驯服的要素，这些要素凭借无可否认的力量, 最终抗拒被纳入任何包罗万象的解读中。

即使是像《分裂的社会》那样对主流研究模型进行“激进”批判，这些“激进”批判也机械地将种群之间相互融合, 归因于经济变动与社会流动。因此，这类批评无法解释, 为什么波多黎各人作为殖民地的少数民族，处于文化附属地位。

.Gemini 的解释
这句话描述的是18世纪中后期，英国社会对启蒙思想家及其作品的反应。这个时期，理性主义和科学探索蓬勃发展，但宗教仍然是社会和个人生活中非常核心的部分。

这句话涉及18世纪英国两位重要的历史学家和思想家——大卫·休谟 (David Hume) 和 爱德华·吉本 (Edward Gibbon)，以及一位与他们同时代的人物 乔纳斯·汉威 (Jonas Hanway)。

|大卫·休谟 (David Hume, 1711-1776)
|他的哲学著作，包含深刻的经验主义和怀疑论思想。他质疑因果关系的必然性、自我同一性，并对宗教信仰的理性基础提出了挑战，这在当时被认为是极具颠覆性和危险的。所以文中说: "他历史著作普遍被认为比他的哲学著作更不容易引起反感...)"

|乔纳斯·汉威 (Jonas Hanway, 1712-1786)
|他以其保守的社会观点和对道德、宗教的关注而闻名（例如，他反对饮茶）. 汉威的活跃期是18世纪中期到后期，他本人就代表了当时一部分对启蒙思想持有警惕态度的社会力量。

|爱德华·吉本 (Edward Gibbon, 1737-1794)
|原文中: "...and Gibbon's perceived tendency to celebrate classical paganism sparked controversy from the first appearance of his history of Rome." (而吉本被认为有庆祝古典异教的倾向，这从他的罗马史首次出版时就引发了争议。)

爱德华·吉本 (Edward Gibbon, 1737-1794)
《罗马帝国衰亡史》(The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire): 吉本的这部巨著被认为是历史学上的里程碑。然而，其最具争议的部分（特别是第15和16章）是他对罗马帝国衰落原因的分析。*吉本认为，基督教的兴起和传播是导致罗马帝国衰落的重要因素之一，因为它削弱了罗马公民的尚武精神、世俗美德和对国家的忠诚，并导致了内部纷争和对异教文化的破坏。* +

“庆祝古典异教”： **吉本的批评, 被解读为他本人对古典异教文化和价值观的偏爱甚至“庆祝”。**他用一种欣赏的笔调描述了罗马异教时期的繁荣、宽容和世俗智慧，并将其与早期基督教的狂热、排他性以及他认为的迷信进行了对比。**这种倾向在当时基督教占据主导地位的社会中是极其敏感和具争议性的。批评者认为他攻击了基督教的根基，**甚至指责他是无神论者或异教徒的同情者。


争议的持久性： 这种争议不仅在吉本的历史著作首次出版时爆发，而且在他有生之年一直持续，甚至影响了他作品的接受度。

Wikipedia : +
**吉本在解释罗马帝国衰落的原因时，其核心论点是皈依基督教，**但这一论点在当今学者中并不被广泛接受。

**吉本认为，随着帝国逐渐被赋予新的基督教特征，原本用于世俗事务、促进国家发展的巨额财富, 被转而用于促进教会活动。然而，前基督教帝国也曾在宗教上投入巨额资金，**宗教的转变是否增加了帝国在宗教上的投入, 尚不清楚。

**吉本进一步指出，基督教的新观念, 导致许多富有的基督徒放弃他们的生活方式，过着修道院般的生活，从而不再参与帝国的支援。然而，尽管许多富有的基督徒确实成为了修道士，但与帝国官僚机构的参与者相比，这显得微不足道。**尽管吉本进一步指出，基督教对和平的重视导致了军队服役人数的下降，但这种下降幅度之小，对于军队的整体效能而言微不足道。

历史学家 SP 福斯特 (SP Foster) 表示，*吉本“将罗马帝国的衰落归咎于基督教对超自然现象的关注，对教会大加嘲讽和谩骂，并嘲笑整个修道制度是一种沉闷的、充满迷信的事业”。*

吉本的作品最初是分部分出版的，这在当时大型作品中很常见。前两卷广受好评，*但随着第三卷的出版，吉本被一些人攻击为“ 异教徒 ”，因为他认为基督教（或者至少是一些神职人员及其追随者对基督教的滥用）加速了罗马帝国的衰落。*

吉本因将异教描绘成宽容的，而将基督教描绘成不宽容的, 而受到批评。
