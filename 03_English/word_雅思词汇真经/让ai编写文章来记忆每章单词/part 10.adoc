== The Garage Sale Negotiation

Seller: Welcome to my garage sale! I've got all sorts of stuff here. Every item has a tag with a price.

Buyer: Wow, you have a lot of merchandise. Is this a genuine antique artefact or a fake souvenir?

Seller: Oh, that's the real deal! It's made of crude iron, not some inferior alloy. Very durable.

Buyer: Hmm. It looks a bit fragile. And what about this wooden stool? The lumber seems good, but the handle is loose.

Seller: That's an easy fix. Just tighten that bolt there. It's a necessity for any workshop. I also have a portable kit with all the utensils: hammer, nails, even a fuse.

Buyer: I do need a new hammer. Mine's junk now. I should recycle the old one, not just toss it in the trash.

Seller: Responsible! I like that. We should all reuse more. Less waste in the landfill. So, interested in the hammer? It's available for a good price.

车库甩卖谈判

卖家: 欢迎来到我的车库甩卖！我这里各种东西都有。每件商品都贴有价格标签。

买家: 哇，你商品真多。这是真古董还是假的纪念品？

卖家: 哦，那可是真货！是生铁做的，不是劣质合金。非常耐用。

买家: 嗯。看起来有点易碎。那这个木凳呢？木材看起来不错，但把手松了。

卖家: 那个好修。拧紧那个螺栓就行。这是任何工作间的必需品。我还有个便携工具包，里面各种用具都有：锤子、钉子，甚至还有个保险丝。

买家: 我确实需要个新锤子。我那个现在成废品了。我应该回收旧的，而不是扔垃圾桶。

卖家: 有责任心！我喜欢。我们都该多重复利用。减少垃圾填埋场的废物。那么，对锤子感兴趣吗？价格很划算。

== The Camping Supply Run

Friend A: Okay, for the camping trip, we need the right outfit and kit. Let's make a list. We have the tent, but we need a raincoat too. The forecast is iffy.

Friend B: Got it. Also, we need a flashlight with spare bulbs, and a lantern. Maybe a portable spotlight too? And don't forget the matches and a candle for the stove.

Friend A: Good call. We'll need a bucket for water, and a pail for washing utensils. We should bring a small broom and a dustpan to sweep the tent.

Friend B: Definitely. And we need a good mattress pad and a warm blanket or quilt. The sleeping bag alone might not be enough. Oh, and a pillow!

Friend A: Pillow? We're roughing it! But fine. Also, we need soap, shampoo, and lotion. All in small, portable bottles. And a towel, of course.

Friend B: This is starting to sound like we're moving into the woods, not camping for two nights! We'll need a ladder to get all this stuff into the car!

Friend A: (Laughs) Okay, okay. Let's try to reuse some old stuff instead of buying new. We can probably find an old blanket and a spare bucket in the garage. Less waste.

Friend B: Now you're talking. Let's also make sure we don't litter. We'll bring bags for our garbage and recycle what we can.

露营用品采购

朋友A: 好了，为了露营旅行，我们需要合适的装备和用品。列个清单吧。我们有帐篷了，但还需要雨衣。天气预报不确定。

朋友B: 明白。还有，我们需要手电筒和备用灯泡，还有提灯。也许再带个便携聚光灯？别忘了火柴和点炉子用的蜡烛。

朋友A: 说得好。我们需要个水桶，还有个洗用具的盆。我们应该带个小扫帚和簸箕来打扫帐篷。

朋友B: 当然。我们还需要个好点的床垫和温暖的毯子或被子。光睡袋可能不够。哦，还有枕头！

朋友A: 枕头？我们是要体验艰苦生活啊！不过好吧。还有，我们需要肥皂、洗发水和沐浴露。都要小瓶便携的。当然还有毛巾。

朋友B: 这听起来开始像是我们要搬进树林里住，而不是露营两晚！我们需要个梯子才能把所有东西搬上车！

朋友A: (笑) 好啦，好啦。我们尽量重复用些旧东西，别买新的。我们大概能在车库里找到旧毯子和备用桶。减少浪费。

朋友B: 这还差不多。我们还得确保不乱扔垃圾。我们带几个袋子装垃圾，并回收能回收的东西。

'''

== The Art Studio Clean-Up

Artist 1: This studio is a mess! There's garbage everywhere. Old paint tubes, used canvases, scraps of fabric and fibre... it's all junk.

Artist 2: I know. We need to recycle what we can. These empty jars can be reused for mixing paints. And we should sweep up this dried plaster.

Artist 1: Good idea. Pass me that broom. And we need a new bulb for the spotlight; this one is burnt out. The switch is okay, but the light is gone.

Artist 2: Here. Be careful with that bucket of water. Don't spill it on the electrical cable for the vacuum cleaner. That would be a shock!

Artist 1: Don't worry! I'll mop the floor after we sweep. Look at this miniature sculpture I made. It's so fragile, I'm afraid it will break.

Artist 2: It's beautiful! Put it on that high shelf, away from the edge. We don't want it to tumble off. What's it made of? Is that brass?

Artist 1: It's an alloy, actually. I used a small forge to make it. Now, where did I put my scissors? I need to trim this cotton fabric.

Artist 2: They're on the stool, next to the glue and the ink. This place will look great once we're done. It's a big hurdle, but we can do it.

艺术工作室大扫除

艺术家1: 这工作室乱死了！到处是垃圾。旧颜料管、用过的画布、布料和纤维碎片…全是废品。

艺术家2: 我知道。我们需要回收能回收的东西。这些空罐子可以重复用来调颜料。我们还得扫掉这些干了的石膏。

艺术家1: 好主意。把扫帚递给我。我们需要换个聚光灯的灯泡；这个烧坏了。开关是好的，但灯不亮了。

艺术家2: 给。小心那桶水。别洒在吸尘器的电线上。会触电的！

艺术家1: 别担心！扫完地我再拖地。看我做的这个微型雕塑。它太易碎了，我怕它会坏掉。

艺术家2: 真漂亮！把它放到那个高架子上，远离边缘。我们可不想它掉下来。什么材质的？是黄铜吗？

艺术家1: 其实是种合金。我用个小锻炉做的。现在，我的剪刀放哪了？我需要修剪这块棉布。

艺术家2: 在凳子上，胶水和墨水旁边。我们收拾完这地方会看起来很棒。是个大工程，但我们能搞定。

'''

== The Hardware Store Mystery

Customer: Excuse me, I need a specific bolt for a shutter on my window. It's a strange size.

Clerk: Okay, let's check the hardware section. We have many factors to consider: metal type, thread size... Was it iron, brass, or maybe bronze?

Customer: I think it was iron. But it was next to a plastic pipe, and maybe some corrosion occurred. It's fused somehow.

Clerk: Ah, that's a common issue. You might need a lubricant to loosen it. We have several brands available. Also, here's a pamphlet on basic plumbing.

Customer: Thanks. While I'm here, I need a new fuse for my refrigerator. The old one blew. And maybe a new cord for a lamp.

Clerk: The electrical aisle is over there. Look for the tags that say "portable appliance cord." Be sure to match the amperage. We don't want a counterfeit fuse causing a fire!

Customer: Definitely not! Safety first. Oh, and I need a new mat for the front door. Something durable, maybe coir or a tough plastic.

lerk: Those are by the ladder and the buckets. You can't miss them. Anything else? A new bucket? A pail? We have a sale on barrels!

Customer: (Laughs) No, no barrel today. But you've been a great help. I should be able to fix everything now.

五金店奇遇

顾客: 打扰一下，我需要一个特定尺寸的螺栓，用来修窗户上的百叶窗。尺寸很怪。

店员: 好的，我们来看看五金区。要考虑很多因素：金属类型、螺纹尺寸…是铁的、黄铜的，还是青铜的？

顾客: 我想是铁的。但它挨着一根塑料管，可能发生了腐蚀。好像熔在一起了。

店员: 啊，那是常见问题。你可能需要润滑剂来松开它。我们有几个品牌可选。还有，这是基本管道维修的小册子。

顾客: 谢谢。既然来了，我还需要个冰箱的新保险丝。旧的烧坏了。可能还要盏灯的新电线。

店员: 电工通道在那边。找标着"便携电器线"的标签。一定要匹配安培数。我们可不想用假冒保险丝引起火灾！

顾客: 当然不想！安全第一。哦，我还需要个新门垫。要耐用的，也许是椰壳纤维或硬塑料的。

店员: 那些在梯子和水桶旁边。你不会错过的。还要别的吗？新水桶？提桶？我们的桶正在打折！

顾客: (笑) 不，今天不要桶。但你帮了大忙。我现在应该能修好所有东西了。

'''

== The Office Supply Saga

Coworker A: Do we have any more stationery? I need to print a memorandum and make a duplicate for the file. The Xerox machine is low on paper.

Coworker B: Check the supply drawer. There should be paper, tissues, and maybe a spare ink cartridge. If not, we'll have to order more.

Coworker A: Found it. Also, I need a cover for this report. And a label for the folder. Do we have any rubber bands or a stapler? The staples are gone.

Coworker B: The stapler is on the shelf, next to the scissors. Be careful, the blades are sharp—they'll shear through paper easily. Don't cut yourself on the edge.

Coworker A: Thanks. Wow, this is a lot of stuff. It's like a miniature office supply store in here. We have everything from pushpins to book covers for paperbacks.

Coworker B: Yeah, we try to keep it well-stocked. It's a necessity for efficiency. By the way, can you pass me that glue? I need to fix the rim of this portfolio; it's coming apart.

Coworker A: Here you go. It's durable stuff. Should hold it. Okay, memorandum is printed, duplicated, and covered. My work here is done!

Coworker B: Not so fast! The fan in the corner is making a weird noise. I think a cable is loose. And the phone hasn't rung all day; is the bell broken?

Coworker A: Ugh. The hurdles never end! Maybe we should just take a vacation.

办公室用品日常

同事A: 我们还有文具吗？我需要打印一份备忘录并复印一份存档。复印机缺纸了。

同事B: 检查一下储物抽屉。应该有纸、纸巾，可能还有备用墨盒。如果没有，我们就得再订购了。

同事A: 找到了。还有，我需要个报告封面。还有个文件夹标签。我们有橡皮筋或订书机吗？订书钉用完了。

同事B: 订书机在架子上，剪刀旁边。小心点，刀片很锋利——很容易剪开纸。别被边缘划伤了。

同事A: 谢谢。哇，东西真多。这里就像个微型办公用品商店。从图钉到平装书的书皮，我们什么都有。

同事B: 是啊，我们尽量保持库存充足。这是提高效率的必需品。顺便问一下，能把胶水递给我吗？我需要修一下这个作品集的边缘；它散开了。

同事A: 给你。这胶水很耐用。应该能粘住。好了，备忘录打印好了，复印好了，封面也装好了。我的工作完成了！

同事B: 没那么快！角落里的风扇发出怪声。我觉得有根电线松了。还有电话一整天都没响；是铃坏了吗？

同事A: 唉。问题没完没了！也许我们该去度假了。

== The Bathroom Renovation Dilemma

Homeowner: The sewerage pipe behind this wall is leaking. We have a problem. A big, smelly problem.

Plumber: Yep. I'll need to cut into the plaster to get to the pipe. It's a messy job. I'll also need to check the tap and the plug in the tub.

Homeowner: Of course. While you're at it, the shower curtain is moldy, and the window pane has a crack. The opacity is fine, but it's not safe.

Plumber: I can handle that. I've got a new pane in my truck. I'll also bring in a ladder to check the vent fan on the ceiling.

Homeowner: Thanks. I'll clear out the bathroom stuff. The towels, the lotion, the shampoo, the razor... I need a shave, but that can wait!

Plumber: (Chuckles) Smart move. Oh, and what about this bath mat? It's seen better days. You might want a new one. Maybe something with a non-slip rubber backing.

Homeowner: Good idea. I'll add it to the list. This renovation is turning into a major hurdle. I didn't anticipate the scope!

Plumber: It always does. But once it's done, it'll be great. New pipes, new fixtures, no more leaks. It'll be durable for years.

Homeowner: I hope so. I can't stand the waste of water. And the smell! Okay, I'll leave you to it. I'll be in the other room, trying not to think about the cost!

浴室翻修困境

房主: 墙后面的污水管漏了。我们有个问题。一个又大又臭的问题。

水管工: 是的。我需要凿开石膏才能接触到管道。这活儿很脏。我还需要检查浴缸的水龙头和塞子。

房主: 当然。你修的时候，淋浴帘发霉了，窗玻璃有裂缝。透明度还行，但不安全。

水管工: 我能处理。我卡车里有新玻璃。我还得搬个梯子来检查天花板上的排气扇。

房主: 谢谢。我把浴室里的东西清空。毛巾、沐浴露、洗发水、剃须刀…我需要刮胡子，但可以等等！

水管工: (轻笑) 明智之举。哦，这个浴室防滑垫呢？该换了。你可能想要个新的。也许要带防滑橡胶底的那种。

房主: 好主意。我把它加到清单里。这次翻修变成个大工程了。我没料到范围这么大！

水管工: 总是这样。但一旦完成，就会很棒。新管道，新装置，不再漏水。能耐用很多年。

房主: 希望如此。我受不了浪费水。还有那味道！好了，你忙吧。我去别的房间，尽量不去想费用！

'''

== The Detective's First Day

Veteran Detective: Here's your badge, rookie. Treat it with respect. It's not a toy.

Rookie Detective: Wow, a real badge! It feels heavy. Is it lead?

Veteran Detective: (Scoffs) Lead? No, it's a special alloy. Now, grab your camera. We're heading to a crime scene at an old textile mill.

Rookie Detective: A mill? What happened?

Veteran Detective: A security guard found a pile of rubbish in a corner. But hidden under a rug was a leather bag. Inside, raw diamonds.

Rookie Detective: Diamonds! So we're looking for a thief?

Veteran Detective: Maybe. Or a smuggler. The fence at the back of the property was cut. With scissors, by the looks of it. A clean cut.

Rookie Detective: So they used scissors to cut through a wire fence? That seems... difficult.

Veteran Detective: Exactly. It's a strange element to the case. Let's go. And don't forget your umbrella; it's pitching it down outside.

侦探的第一天

老侦探: 这是你的警徽，菜鸟。要尊重它。这不是玩具。

菜鸟侦探: 哇，真警徽！摸起来很重。是铅做的吗？

老侦探: (嗤笑) 铅？不，是一种特殊合金。现在，拿上你的相机。我们要去一个旧纺织厂的犯罪现场。

菜鸟侦探: 纺织厂？发生了什么？

老侦探: 保安在一个角落发现了一堆垃圾。但地毯下面藏着一个皮包。里面是未加工的钻石。

菜鸟侦探: 钻石！所以我们在找小偷？

老侦探: 也许是。或者是走私犯。物业后面的铁丝网被剪断了。看切口像是用剪刀剪的。很整齐的切口。

菜鸟侦探: 所以他们用剪刀剪断了铁丝网？这似乎…很困难。

老侦探: 没错。这是案子里一个奇怪的因素。我们走吧。别忘了你的伞；外面在下倾盆大雨。

'''

== The Home Renovation Project

Homeowner: Okay, the old carpet has to go. It's full of stains. We'll replace it with a new rug.

Friend: Good plan. But what about this cement floor underneath? It's rough. We should put down a cushion underlay first.

Homeowner: Smart thinking. That'll make it softer underfoot. Now, help me lift this old fridge. It's heavy! What's in it, fuel?

Friend: (Grunts) Feels like it! Maybe we can use it in the garage? But we need to clean it first. I'll get the detergent and a sponge.

Homeowner: Thanks. After this, I want to tackle the fence in the backyard. The wood is rotten. I'm thinking of using a new material, like nylon composite. It's durable.

Friend: Nylon? For a fence? Interesting. By the way, the sheets for the guest bed came. They're a nice linen blend.

Homeowner: Perfect. My mother knit a new blanket for it too. She can weave such intricate patterns.

Friend: She's talented! Now, pass me those scissors. I need to cut this wax paper for the shelves.

Homeowner: Here you go. Be careful, the blades are sharp. I don't want you to need a lift to the hospital!

家居装修项目

房主: 好了，旧地毯必须扔掉了。全是污渍。我们换块新的。

朋友: 好计划。但下面的水泥地怎么办？很粗糙。我们应该先铺一层软垫底层。

房主: 想得周到。那样脚感会软一些。现在，帮我搬一下这个旧冰箱。真重！里面装了什么，燃料吗？

朋友: (用力声) 感觉像！也许我们可以把它放在车库用？但得先清洗一下。我去拿清洁剂和海绵。

房主: 谢谢。弄完这个，我想修一下后院的篱笆。木头烂了。我在想用新材料，比如尼龙复合材料。很耐用。

朋友: 尼龙？做篱笆？有意思。对了，客房的床单送到了。是很好的亚麻混纺。

房主: 太好了。我妈妈还织了一条新毯子。她能织出很复杂的图案。

朋友: 她真有天赋！现在，把剪刀递给我。我需要剪一下架子上用的蜡纸。

房主: 给。小心点，刀片很锋利。我可不想你得坐车去医院！

'''

== The Artist's Studio

Artist: I need a new material for my sculptures. I'm tired of clay. I was thinking of using wax.

Curator: Wax? That's a fragile medium. A strong light could melt it. What about something more durable, like cement?

Artist: Cement is so... heavy. I want something I can weave or knit with my hands. Maybe strands of nylon? I could create a crystal-like effect.

Curator: That's ambitious! You'd need to heat the material carefully. You could create something truly unique. But it's a raw, unproven technique.

Artist: I know. It's a risk. But I want to push the boundaries. The main element of my new series is transparency and light.

Curator: I admire that. By the way, the camera crew will be here tomorrow to film a documentary. They want to capture your process.

Artist: Great. Can you help me move this sheet of leather? I use it as a backdrop. It needs a good clean first. Pass me that bucket and detergent.

Curator: Sure. But we might need to lubricate the wheels on that cart first. They squeak terribly.

艺术家的工作室

艺术家: 我需要一种新的雕塑材料。我厌倦了粘土。我在考虑用蜡。

策展人: 蜡？那是一种脆弱的媒介。强光就能融化它。为什么不试试更耐用的材料，比如水泥？

艺术家: 水泥太…重了。我想要一种可以用手编织或针织的东西。也许用尼龙线？我可以创造出水晶般的效果。

策展人: 真有野心！你需要小心地加热材料。你可能会创造出真正独特的东西。但这是一种原始、未经证实的技术。

艺术家: 我知道。有风险。但我想突破界限。我新系列的主要元素是透明度和光。

策展人: 我欣赏这点。对了，摄制组明天要来拍纪录片。他们想记录你的创作过程。

艺术家: 太好了。你能帮我搬一下这张皮革吗？我把它当背景用。需要先好好清洁一下。把那个桶和清洁剂递给我。

策展人: 当然。但我们可能得先给手推车的轮子上点润滑油。它们吱吱响得厉害。

== The Jewelry Maker's Dilemma

Jeweler: I'm nervous. This is the largest diamond I've ever worked with. One wrong move and it's a pile of crystal shards.

Apprentice: You can do it! Just remember to keep the drill bit lubricated. The fuel for the micro-motor is full, right?

Jeweler: Yes, yes. The fuel is fine. Pass me that small can of oil. I need to lubricate the pedal mechanism too. It's sticking.

Apprentice: Here you go. So, you'll cut the main facets first? That's the key element of the design.

Jeweler: Exactly. Then I'll work on the finer details. I'll use a wax model to guide me. This leather pouch is for the finished piece.

Apprentice: It's going to be beautiful. The client will love it. They want it to look like a woven pattern, but in crystal.

Jeweler: That's the challenge. To make hard stone look like soft weave. Okay, deep breath. Let's begin.

珠宝匠的困境

珠宝匠: 我很紧张。这是我处理过的最大的钻石。一步走错，它就成一堆水晶碎片了。

学徒: 你能行的！记得给钻头润滑。微型马达的燃料是满的，对吧？

珠宝匠: 是，是。燃料没问题。把那小罐油递给我。踏板机构也需要润滑。有点卡。

学徒: 给。那么，你先切主刻面？这是设计的关键元素。

珠宝匠: 没错。然后处理更精细的细节。我会用一个蜡模来引导我。这个皮袋是放成品的。

学徒: 它会很漂亮的。客户会喜欢的。他们希望它看起来像编织图案，但是用水晶做的。

珠宝匠: 这就是挑战所在。让坚硬的石头看起来像柔软的编织物。好了，深呼吸。开始吧。

== The Soggy Garden Party

Host: The weather forecast was wrong! It's not a light shower; it's a downpour! The pit for the barbecue is flooded!

Guest: Don't worry! I brought a large umbrella. We can move the party under the tree. The leaves will provide some cover.

Host: Good idea. But the ground is soaked. We need something to put on the grass. Do we have a plastic sheet or a rug?

Guest: I have an old nylon tarpaulin in my car. It's not pretty, but it will work. Help me lift it; it's heavy when wet.

Host: Thanks! You're a lifesaver. Now, what about the food? The fridge in the garage is working, right?

Guest: Yes, but the power cord is frayed. I saw a bare wire. We should not use it. It's a safety hazard.

Host: Oh, great. So all the fuel for the grill is wet, and the fridge is off-limits. This party is turning into a disaster!

Guest: Not necessarily! We can have a picnic on the tarp! I have a knife to open the cans. We'll make it work!

Host: (Laughs) Okay, okay. You're right. Let's not let a little rain spoil the fun. Pass me the scissors to cut the tape on this food container.

潮湿的花园派对

主人: 天气预报错了！不是小雨，是倾盆大雨！烧烤坑淹水了！

客人: 别担心！我带了一把大伞。我们可以把派对移到树下。树叶能挡点雨。

主人: 好主意。但地面都湿透了。我们需要在草地上铺点东西。我们有塑料布或地毯吗？

客人: 我车里有张旧尼龙防水布。不好看，但能用。帮我抬一下；湿了很重。

主人: 谢谢！你真是救星。现在食物怎么办？车库里的冰箱是好的吧？

客人: 是的，但电源线磨损了。我看到露出的电线了。我们不应该用它。有安全隐患。

主人: 哦，太好了。所以烧烤的燃料湿了，冰箱也不能用。这个派对要变成灾难了！

客人: 不一定！我们可以在防水布上野餐！我有小刀开罐头。我们能搞定的！

主人: (笑) 好啦，好啦。你说得对。我们不能让一点雨破坏了兴致。把剪刀递给我，我要打开这个食品盒的胶带。

== The Riverside Cleanup

Volunteer A: This river is a mess. We need to dredge the bottom to remove all the rubbish. It's a big job.

Volunteer B: I know. Look at all this plastic. We should separate it for recycle. This material is a nightmare for the environment.

Volunteer A: Absolutely. Hand me that grabber tool. I see a can stuck in the mud. We need to be careful not to damage the natural habitat.

Volunteer B: Got it. Hey, what's that shiny thing over there? Near that fence post.

Volunteer A: I'll check. (Wades over) Wow! It's a crystal! A real quartz crystal! It must have washed down from the old mine upstream.

Volunteer B: No way! That's a great find. It's like the universe is giving us a reward for our hard work.

Volunteer A: (Laughs) I'd rather it gave us a new dredge machine! My back is killing me. Pass me the water bottle; my fuel is low.

Volunteer B: Here you go. Don't drink it all; we have a lot of riverbank left to clean. This is my project, and I want it done right!

Volunteer A: Yes, boss! But finding that crystal is a bright spot. It's a real diamond in the rough... or should I say, in the rubbish!

河边清理行动

志愿者A: 这条河一团糟。我们需要疏浚河底，清除所有垃圾。这可是个大工程。

志愿者B: 我知道。看这些塑料。我们应该分类回收。这种材料对环境来说是噩梦。

志愿者A: 绝对正确。把那个夹子递给我。我看到一个罐头陷在泥里。我们要小心，不能破坏自然栖息地。

志愿者B: 拿到了。嘿，那边栅栏柱附近亮晶晶的是什么？

志愿者A: 我去看看。(涉水过去) 哇！是水晶！一块真正的石英水晶！肯定是从上游旧矿场冲下来的。

志愿者B: 不会吧！真是重大发现。就像宇宙对我们辛勤工作的奖励。

志愿者A: (笑) 我宁愿它给我们一台新的疏浚机！我的背疼死了。把水瓶递给我；我没力气了。

志愿者B: 给。别喝完；我们还有很长一段河岸要清理。这是我的项目，我要把它做好！

志愿者A: 是，老板！不过找到那块水晶是个亮点。真是沙里淘金…或者我该说，垃圾里淘金！

== The Broken Cupboard

Handyperson: Okay, the problem is this cupboard door. The knob is broken, see? It just spins. You can't get a grip to open it.

Homeowner: Ugh, yes. It's been driving me crazy. I have to use a scissors to lever it open sometimes. It's a safety hazard.

Handyperson: Well, the fix is easy. I just need to replace the knob. But the real issue is this hinge. It's rusty. I need to lubricate it.

Homeowner: Of course. Do what you need to do. There's a can of lubricant in the garage, on the shelf next to the detergent.

Handyperson: Great. I'll be right back. Also, I noticed a small crack in the cement wall here. I can patch that up for you too. I have some lime-based filler.

Homeowner: You're a lifesaver! This old house has so many little problems. It's a mine of DIY disasters waiting to happen.

Handyperson: (Chuckles) Don't worry, that's my job! To fix the pits and patches. Okay, new knob is on. Give it a turn.

Homeowner: Oh, that's smooth! No more fighting with the door. Thank you so much!

Handyperson: My pleasure. Now, about that crack...

坏掉的橱柜

维修工: 好了，问题是这个橱柜门。球形把手坏了，看到了吗？光打转。你抓不住，打不开。

房主: 唉，是的。快把我逼疯了。我有时不得不用剪刀撬开它。有安全隐患。

维修工: 嗯，修理起来很容易。我只需要换个把手。但真正的问题是合页。生锈了。需要上点润滑油。

房主: 当然。需要什么你就用。车库架子上有一罐润滑油，在清洁剂旁边。

维修工: 好的。我马上回来。另外，我注意到这里的水泥墙有条小裂缝。我也可以帮你补一下。我有一些石灰基的填充料。

房主: 你真是救星！这老房子小问题真多。就像个待发生的DIY灾难矿坑。

维修工: (轻笑) 别担心，这就是我的工作！修补坑洼。好了，新把手装上了。转一下试试。

房主: 哦，很顺滑！再也不用跟门较劲了。太谢谢你了！

维修工: 不客气。现在，关于那个裂缝…
