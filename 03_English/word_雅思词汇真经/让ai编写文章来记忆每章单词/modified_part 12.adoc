== The Restaurant Review

​​Diner A:​​ I have a huge appetite today. Let's look at the menu. I'm thinking of ordering the spicy beef dish.

​​Diner B:​​ That sounds delicious, but I'm a vegetarian. I'll probably get the vegetable stir-fry. The chef here is a gourmet, so it should be tasty.

​​Diner A:​​ Good point. Should we get an appetiser to share? Maybe some spring rolls? And what about drinks? I'm thirsty.

​​Diner B:​​ I'll just have a soda. You go ahead and get a whisky if you want. Just don't get drunk before the main course!

​​Diner A:​​ (Laughs) No promises! The food here has such a rich flavour. The sauce is always perfect. I love the ginger and garlic they use.

​​Waiter:​​ Are you ready to order?

​​Diner A:​​ Yes, we'll have the spicy beef, the vegetable stir-fry, an order of spring rolls, a soda, and a whisky.

​​Waiter:​​ Excellent choices. Your food will be ready shortly.

== The Cooking Experiment

​​Chef:​​ Okay, for this recipe, we need to grind these spices first. The flavour comes from fresh ginger, garlic, and a little chili for a spicy kick.

​​Sous Chef:​​ Got it. Should I peel the potatoes and carrots? Then I can slice them for the pot.

​​Chef:​​ Yes, please. And we'll need to soak the beans beforehand. They need to soften. We'll cook them on the stove with the pork.

​​Sous Chef:​​ What about the sauce? Ketchup and vinegar?

​​Chef:​​ Actually, we'll make a special sauce. We'll squeeze a lemon, add some honey, and a bit of mustard. It will be sweet and sour.

​​Sous Chef:​​ Yummy! I'll get the pot and pan ready. Should I preheat the oven for the bread?

​​Chef:​​ Good idea. We'll bake a small loaf to go with the soup. This is going to be a delicious supper!

== The Healthy Diet Plan

​​Friend A:​​ I need to change my diet. I'm always hungry for junk food. I want to eat more edible whole foods like fruits and vegetables.

​​Friend B:​​ That's a great idea. You can start with a big salad for lunch. Lots of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and some nuts for crunch.

​​Friend A:​​ Good plan. And for a snack, instead of candy, I can have an apple or a pear. Maybe with a little peanut butter?

​​Friend B:​​ Perfect! And drink lots of water or herbal tea when you feel thirsty. It helps with digestion. Avoid too much sugar and salt.

​​Friend A:​​ It's hard! I love the flavour of chocolate and ice cream.

​​Friend B:​​ It's okay to have a treat sometimes! Just not every day. Maybe once a week, you can have a small piece of dark chocolate. It's all about balance.

== The Grand Banquet

​​Host:​​ The banquet is tomorrow! We need to cater for fifty people. Let's finalise the menu.

​​Event Planner:​​ The main course will be roast chicken with potatoes. For the vegetarian option, a pasta dish with mushroom sauce.

​​Host:​​ Good. And for appetisers? We need a variety. Some things they can eat with a fork or spoon, others they can just pick up.

​​Event Planner:​​ We'll have small sandwiches, a fruit platter with melon and grapes, and some biscuits with cheese. For dessert, a chocolate pudding.

​​Host:​​ Excellent. And the drinks? We'll have juice, soda, coffee, and a selection of alcohol, including brandy. But we must ensure no one gets drunk!

​​Event Planner:​​ Of course. We'll have plenty of water available too. The cutlery is all silver, and the dishes are ceramic. It will be a lovely evening.

== The Quick Snack

​​Student A:​​ I'm so hungry! I need a snack before my next class. Let's go to the cafeteria.

​​Student B:​​ Okay, but make it quick. What are you going to get? A hamburger? A slice of pizza?

​​Student A:​​ Maybe just a yogurt and a banana. I need something easy to digest. I don't want to feel sleepy.

​​Student B:​​ That's smart. I'll just get a coffee in a mug. I need the caffeine to stay awake!

​​Student A:​​ (Laughs) I know the feeling. Okay, let's go. I hope the line isn't too long.

== The Grocery Shopping Trip

​​Shopper A:​​ Okay, we need provisions for the week. Let's start in the dairy section. We need milk, butter, and cheese.

​​Shopper B:​​ Got it. And let's get some yogurt too. For fruit, how about some oranges, peaches, and maybe a kiwi?

​​Shopper A:​​ Good idea. Now, for vegetables. We need onions, cabbage, and some fresh peas. Oh, and don't forget the turnips for the soup.

​​Shopper B:​​ I'll grab a tin of tomatoes as well. It's always good to have. What about protein? Fish? Or some turkey?

​​Shopper A:​​ Let's get both. We can have fish one night and roast turkey another. I'll see if they have any good sausage too.

​​Shopper B:​​ This is quite a haul! Our fridge will be full. I'm already thinking about the delicious meals we can cook.

​​Shopper A:​​ Me too! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Let's go through the checkout. I hope we have enough bags!

== The Fancy Dinner Party

​​Host:​​ Welcome, welcome! Please, have a drink. We have various beverages: juice, wine, even a fine liquor if you prefer.

​​Guest:​​ Thank you! This is a beautiful spread. The cutlery is lovely. Is that porcelain?

​​Host:​​ Yes, it is. And the glasses are crystal. Now, let me tell you about the menu. The main course is a pasta dish, specifically spaghetti with a special sauce.

​​Guest:​​ Wonderful! I see a tray of appetisers over there. What are those?

​​Host:​​ Those are mini sandwiches, and next to them is a bowl of mixed nuts. Please, help yourself. There's also a selection of pies for dessert.

​​Guest:​​ Everything looks so tasty. You've outdone yourself! The flavour in this sauce is incredible. Is that a hint of vanilla?

​​Host:​​ You have a keen palate! Yes, just a touch. I'm so glad you like it. Please, enjoy the evening!

== The Cozy Café

​​Customer A:​​ I'll just have a black coffee, please. In a mug, not a glass.

​​Barista:​​ Of course. And for you?

​​Customer B:​​ I'd like a tea. Do you have any herbal blends? Maybe something with ginger?

​​Barista:​​ We have a lovely ginger and lemon tea. Would you like honey with that?

​​Customer B:​​ Yes, please. That sounds perfect. Are those biscuits fresh?

​​Barista:​​ Baked this morning! We have plain ones and some with jam.

​​Customer A:​​ I'll take one with jam. I need a little sweet treat. It's so cozy in here. A great place to relax.

​​Barista:​​ Here you go. Enjoy!

== The Student Refectory

​​Student A:​​ I'm so hungry after that lecture. Let's grab something from the refectory buffet.

​​Student B:​​ Good idea. I hope they have something decent. Last time, the porridge was like paste. And the corn was tough.

​​Student A:​​ (Laughs) True. But I'm not picky today. Look, they have a takeaway bar for salads. I'll get a bowl with radish and scallions.

​​Student B:​​ I might get the hot meal. It looks like mutton stew. I need something hearty to swallow after chewing on that textbook all morning.

​​Student A:​​ Smart. I'll just have a quick snack as a refreshment. Then I need to study. I want to stay sober for my exam.

​​Student B:​​ Me too. No cigarettes or tobacco for me today! I need my wits about me. Let's eat and then hit the books.

== The Farm Visit

​​City Dweller:​​ Wow, look at all the crops! Is that wheat over there?

​​Farmer:​​ Yes, that's wheat. We'll reap it soon. And that field is corn. The grain looks good this year.

​​City Dweller:​​ Amazing. And what about livestock? Do you have animals?

​​Farmer:​​ We do. We raise sheep for mutton. They graze by the pond. We also have a few chickens.

​​City Dweller:​​ I see. What's that building with the big furnace?

​​Farmer:​​ That's where we dry the grain. We also grind some into flour there. It's hard work.

​​City Dweller:​​ I bet. It must be satisfying to see the fruit of your labor. It really makes you appreciate your food.

== The Exotic Food Market

​​Foodie A:​​ This market is incredible! Look at this exotic cuisine. What's this purple thing?

​​Vendor:​​ That's eggplant, sir. Very fresh. And these are fresh plums. Sweet, not bitter.

​​Foodie A:​​ Great! And what are these red berries?

​​Vendor:​​ Those are cherries. And this is a papaya. You can eat the flesh, but don't swallow the seeds. The hull is not edible.

​​Foodie B:​​ I'm fascinated by these spices. What's this green paste?

​​Vendor:​​ That's wasabi. Very spicy! And this is pepper. Be careful, it can make you sneeze!

​​Foodie A:​​ We'll take some of everything. We want to try new ingredients. Maybe we'll have a barbecue tonight.

​​Foodie B:​​ Perfect! We can make a sauce with these. It'll be a great supplement to the meat. Let's go pay.

== The Cozy Kitchen

​​Home Cook A:​​ Okay, I'm making porridge. Can you pass me the kettle? I need hot water.

​​Home Cook B:​​ Sure. Here you go. What's in it? Just oats and water?

​​Home Cook A:​​ I add a bit of flour to thicken it. And some berries for flavour. Maybe a plum or two.

​​Home Cook B:​​ Nice. I'll make some toast. I'll use the knife to slice this bread. Do we have butter?

​​Home Cook A:​​ In the fridge. Check under the lid of that blue dish. Be careful, the knife is sharp!

​​Home Cook B:​​ Don't worry, I'm sober! I won't cut myself. Oh, we're out of butter. I'll just use a bit of honey.

​​Home Cook A:​​ That works. This hunger is making me impatient. I just want to lick the spoon!

​​Home Cook B:​​ (Laughs) Hold on! It's almost ready. We can dip our toast in the porridge. Yum!

== The Fancy Dinner Party

​​Host:​​ Welcome! Please, try the appetisers. Don't be shy. There's a bowl of dip for the vegetables.

​​Guest A:​​ Thank you. Everything looks exquisite. What's in this dip? It has a unique scent, almost like perfume.

​​Host:​​ Oh, that's a special recipe with herbs. Now, for the main course, we have a choice of meat. The mutton is particularly good.

​​Guest B:​​ I'll have the mutton. I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse! I'll need a sharp knife to cut it.

​​Host:​​ (Chuckles) Of course. The side dish is grilled eggplant and corn on the cob. Please, chew thoroughly.

​​Guest A:​​ This is delicious. The flavours are so complex. Not bitter at all. What's for dessert?

​​Host:​​ We have ice cream! Homemade. And fresh berries. You can suck on the cherry pits if you like!

​​Guest B:​​ (Laughs) I think I'll just swallow the ice cream! It's too good to play with. A perfect end to the meal.

== The Fishing Trip

​​Angler A:​​ This is a peaceful pond. Perfect for fishing. Did you bring the rods?

​​Angler B:​​ Yep, right here. I also have some supplies. A thermos with coffee, and some sandwiches if we get hungry.

​​Angler A:​​ Good thinking. I hope we catch something. I'd love some fresh fish for supper.

​​Angler B:​​ Me too. Just remember, we have to remove the core and the scales. It's a bit of work.

​​Angler A:​​ I know, I know. I'll do the cleaning. You can cook. You're better at it.

​​Angler B:​​ Deal. I'll pan-fry it with a little pepper. Maybe a strip of bacon for flavour.

​​Angler A:​​ Now you're making me hungry! Let's just focus on catching one first. I feel a nibble!

== The Doctor's Visit

​​Dentist:​​ Okay, open wide. Let's have a look at your gums. Hmm, they look a bit inflamed. Do you chew gum a lot?

​​Patient:​​ Sometimes. Sugar-free. Is that bad?

​​Dentist:​​ It can be, if you do it too much. The constant chewing isn't great for your teeth or gums. I see you also have a tooth that needs a core build-up.

​​Patient:​​ Oh dear. That doesn't sound good. What causes that?

​​Dentist:​​ Often, it's from chewing on hard things. Or just wear and tear. We'll need to fix it. In the meantime, try to avoid very hard foods.

​​Patient:​​ I will. No more chewing ice! I promise. I need to keep my teeth to chew my food properly!

​​Dentist:​​ Exactly! Good oral health helps you swallow and digest your food better. Now, let's schedule that appointment.

== The Afternoon Tea

​​Host:​​ Would you like more tea? I can pour from the kettle.

​​Guest:​​ Yes, please. But my cup is quite full. The saucer is already catching the drips!

​​Host:​​ Oh, let me get a fresh saucer for you. There we go. Now, try one of these pastries. They're not too sweet, just a hint of cherry.

​​Guest:​​ Thank you. They look lovely. I'll use the small knife to cut it. My hunger is finally gone after that big lunch.

​​Guest:​​ It's delicious. The flavour is perfect. Not bitter at all. This is a wonderful refreshment.

​​Host:​​ I'm glad you like it. It's a simple recipe. The main ingredient is almond paste. It's a nice supplement to a good cup of tea.

​​Guest:​​ It certainly is. A perfect way to spend the afternoon.
