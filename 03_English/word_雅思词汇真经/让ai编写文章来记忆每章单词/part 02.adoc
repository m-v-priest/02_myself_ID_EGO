== Article 1: Photosynthesis, Respiration, and Plant Life

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants absorb sunlight and use it to convert water and carbon dioxide into organic food molecules. In simple terms, plants take in light, water, and gases from the surroundings, and through a chemical mechanism, they produce energy-rich substances. This process also releases oxygen, which is vital for animals and humans to respire. When animals respire, they take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide, so photosynthesis and respiration form a natural counterbalance.

In botany, which is the scientific study of plants, we learn how vegetation sustains ecosystems. For example, a rainforest is full of tall trees with wide leaves, while a jungle is denser and more difficult to cross. A plantation is land used to cultivate crops, usually on a large scale, while a small field or terrace is often used by farmers to sow seeds and later harvest crops. Farmers may plough the soil with machines or dig it using a spade. After that, they may use a rake to make the soil smooth and suitable for seeds. These agricultural activities are considered arable practices, which means they are related to growing crops on land.

Plant reproduction shows remarkable diversity. Some species are perennial, meaning they live for many years and continue to blossom or bloom each season, while others are short-lived. Short-day plants need longer nights to flower, while shade-tolerant species can grow even under reduced light. During reproduction, plants produce pollen, which allows seeds to germinate. Seeds may burgeon into young shoots, develop buds, and later produce flowers. The scent of these flowers can be aromatic, such as the fragrance of mint, violet, or tulip. Fruits may ripen after pollination, and they can be plucked or picked for consumption. However, if fruits are left too long, they may wither, rot, or decay, becoming stale.

In addition, fungus and mould play a role in decomposition. Though destructive, they are also necessary, because they help dead matter decompose and return nutrients to the soil, which other plants can absorb. In this way, decomposition, though unpleasant, is an eco-friendly process that supports the ecosystem.

光合作用是植物吸收阳光，并利用其将水和二氧化碳转化为有机食物分子的过程。简单来说，植物从周围环境中吸收光、水和气体，并通过化学机制产生富含能量的物质。这个过程还会释放出氧气，而氧气对于动物和人类的呼吸至关重要。当动物呼吸时，它们吸入氧气并排出二氧化碳，因此光合作用和呼吸形成了自然的平衡。

在植物学（研究植物的科学）中，我们学习到植被如何维持生态系统。例如，热带雨林里充满了高大的树木和宽大的叶子，而丛林则更密集，更难穿越。种植园是大规模种植作物的土地，而小型的田地或梯田则常被农民用来播种和收获庄稼。农民可能会用机器犁地，或者用铁锹挖地，之后再用耙子整理土地，使其适合播种。这些农业活动被称为可耕作的实践，也就是与在土地上种植作物相关的活动。

植物的繁殖显示出惊人的多样性。有些植物是多年生的，意味着它们能存活多年，并在每个季节不断开花，而另一些则生命周期短。短日照植物需要更长的夜晚才能开花，而耐荫植物即使在光线不足的情况下也能生长。在繁殖过程中，植物产生花粉，使种子得以发芽。种子可能会萌芽成幼苗，长出芽，再长成花朵。花朵的香气可能是芳香的，比如薄荷、紫罗兰或郁金香的味道。果实可能在授粉后成熟，人们可以将它们摘取或采摘来食用。然而，如果果实放置太久，它们可能会枯萎、腐烂或分解，变得不新鲜。

此外，真菌和霉菌在分解中扮演角色。尽管具有破坏性，但它们同样重要，因为它们帮助死亡的物质分解并将养分归还土壤，其他植物便能再次吸收。因此，分解虽令人不快，却是一种环保的过程，支持着生态系统。

== Article 2: Agriculture, Ecology, and Human Practices

Modern agriculture is more than just planting crops. It involves genetics, variation, and even mutation studies to improve plant growth. Scientists use hybridisation, which means crossing two different species, to create new plants with favourable traits. For instance, hybrid crops may show higher yield, be more resistant to disease, or grow in arable land with poor soil. This shows how humans can classify organisms scientifically and then reproduce them under controlled conditions.

Farmers use many tools in their work. They may carry a bundle of straw, tie it into a bunch, and later put it in a heap or neatly stack it for storage. Sometimes, dried flowers may be placed in a vase for decoration, showing the cultural side of horticulture, which is the art and science of growing plants for beauty as well as food.

Agriculture also faces risks. A bush fire can endanger crops, and firefighters may have to extinguish the flames. If farmland is repeatedly burned or cut, people may deforest the land, leaving it barren. On the other hand, with careful planning, land can be reclaimed, cultivated, and made fertile again. Farmers may also use fertilizers to fertilise the soil, but overuse may degrade its quality and undermine long-term productivity. This shows the importance of conservation—that is, to protect and preserve resources for future generations.

现代农业不仅仅是种植庄稼。它涉及遗传学、变异甚至突变研究，以促进植物生长。科学家使用杂交，也就是将两种不同的物种交叉，以创造出具有有利特征的新植物。例如，杂交作物可能具有更高的产量，更强的抗病性，或能在可耕作但土壤贫瘠的土地上生长。这表明人类可以科学地分类生物，并在控制条件下使它们繁殖。

农民在工作中使用许多工具。他们可能会搬运一捆稻草，把它扎成一束，然后放在一堆里，或者整齐地堆放起来储存。有时，干花会被插在花瓶里作为装饰，这就体现了园艺的文化一面，即不仅种植食物，也为美化环境而栽培植物。

农业同样面临风险。一场丛林火灾可能会危及庄稼，消防员必须扑灭火焰。如果农田反复被烧毁或砍伐，人们可能会毁林，让土地变得贫瘠。但另一方面，通过合理规划，土地可以被开垦、耕种，重新变得肥沃。农民还可能使用肥料来施肥土壤，但过度使用可能会降低其质量，削弱长期的生产力。这表明了保护的重要性，即要保护和保存资源，供未来世代使用。

== Article 3: Ecology, Energy, and Environmental Impact

An ecosystem is the interaction between organisms and their surroundings. Every seasonal cycle shows how plants and animals adapt. For example, some animals perish in winter if they cannot find shelter, while others evolve to survive cold climates. Plant growth may fluctuate depending on weather conditions, and this has a direct impact on food supply.

From a scientific perspective, ecology examines not only plants and animals but also chemical processes. For instance, enzymes act as catalysts, which means they speed up chemical reactions in cells. In plants, enzymes help control photosynthesis and energy conversion. Energy uptake must not exceed what the system can handle; otherwise, it may damage tissues. This is why scientists run experimental tests in favourable and optimal conditions to study growth.

Environmental problems include toxic gases and pollution. Factories release emissions, such as smoke and chemical pollutants, which may contaminate the air. In the long run, this may cause extinction of species. To avoid this, societies promote eco-friendly technology, such as renewable energy. Some areas even demolish old polluting industries and replace them with cleaner ones. However, if rules are ignored, industries may infringe on environmental laws and jeopardise public health.

The outcomes of human action can be considerable, even massive or immense in scale. A productive, efficient, and effective system can generate food and energy for millions, but a destructive one may bring ruin. Therefore, scientists stress that human activity must not only aim for maximal profit but also respect minimal environmental harm. The pattern is clear: the only sustainable path is conservation.

生态系统是生物与周围环境之间的相互作用。每一个季节性的循环都展示了动植物如何适应。例如，一些动物如果在冬季找不到庇护所，就会死亡，而另一些则会进化以适应寒冷的气候。植物的生长可能会随着天气条件波动，而这会直接影响食物供应。

从科学角度看，生态学不仅研究动植物，还研究化学过程。例如，酶是一种催化剂，也就是能加速细胞中的化学反应。在植物中，酶帮助控制光合作用和能量转化。能量的吸收不能超过系统所能承受的范围，否则可能会损伤组织。这就是为什么科学家要在有利的和最佳的条件下进行实验性的研究。

环境问题包括有毒气体和污染。工厂会排放烟雾和化学污染物，这些物质可能会污染空气。长期来看，这可能导致物种的灭绝。为了避免这种情况，社会提倡环保技术，比如可再生能源。有些地方甚至会拆毁旧的污染工业，用更清洁的产业取而代之。然而，如果忽视法规，企业可能会侵犯环境法律，并危及公众健康。

人类行为的结果可能是相当大的，甚至是巨大的或庞大的。一个高产的、高效的、有效的系统可以为数百万人提供食物和能源，但一个破坏性的系统则可能带来毁灭。因此，科学家强调，人类活动不仅要追求最大的利润，还要尊重最小的环境损害。规律很明显：唯一可持续的道路就是保护环境。
