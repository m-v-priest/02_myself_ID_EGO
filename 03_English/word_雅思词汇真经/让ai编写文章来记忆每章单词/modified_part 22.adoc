== The Quarterly Business Review

​​CEO:​​ Good morning. Let's begin our quarterly review. Annually, this meeting sets our precedent for the next three months. Initially, we'll look at the preceding quarter's results.

​​CFO:​​ Thank you. Immediately, I can say we've had a consecutive period of growth. Our annual revenue is up 12%. We're present in all key markets, and our strategy is up-to-date.

​​COO:​​ However, an issue is imminent. Our supply chain disruption is ongoing. We need an immediate solution for the upcoming holiday season, which is our foremost priority.

​​CEO:​​ Understood. In the meantime, let's focus on the present. We have a billion-dollar opportunity in the modern tech sector. This could be the dawn of a new era for us.

​​CFO:​​ Incidentally, our cash flow is strong. We have millions in reserve. But we must be punctual with our payments to maintain our contemporary image.

​​COO:​​ Finally, I propose we finish this meeting by midday so teams can act instantly. We'll meet periodically to monitor progress.

== The Museum Curator's Dilemma

​​Senior Curator:​​ This medieval artifact is fascinating. It's from the 12th century, preceding the Renaissance era. But its restoration is an ongoing challenge.

​​Junior Curator:​​ It's incredible to hold something so ancient. But our modern techniques feel inadequate. We need a contemporary approach that's up-to-date yet respectful.

​​Senior Curator:​​ Exactly. The preceding restoration attempts in the 18th century caused damage. We must set a new precedent. Initially, I thought we'd need years, but recent advances might shorten the duration.

​​Junior Curator:​​ Meanwhile, the permanent exhibition is scheduled for our anniversary next year. We have a billion visitors expected annually. The pressure is immense!

​​Senior Curator:​​ True. But in the midst of this, remember the artifact's everlasting value. Our work must be punctual, but never rushed. We'll work on it daily, and review progress monthly.

​​Junior Curator:​​ It's a momentous task. But finally seeing it finished will be incredible. I'll start immediately.

== The Software Launch Crisis

​​Project Manager:​​ We have an imminent deadline. The final version must be finished by midnight tonight for the quarterly release. This is our foremost priority.

​​Lead Developer:​​ The preceding version was stable, but the recent update introduced a major bug. It's an ongoing nightmare. I've been working overnight for a dozen nights consecutively.

​​QA Engineer:​​ Meanwhile, I'm testing the intermediate builds. The issue is present in all modern browsers. We need an instant fix. The duration of this crisis is unacceptable.

​​Project Manager:​​ I need a solution immediately. Our annual review is next month, and this project is critical. We must be punctual. Do we have a precedent for this?

​​Lead Developer:​​ Incidentally, yes. A similar bug occurred a millennium ago in software terms – back in 2010! But the fix was permanent. I'll apply a similar approach now.

​​Project Manager:​​ Good. Work on it moment by moment. I'll check in periodically. Let's finish this by midday. The future of this product depends on it!

== The Historical Documentary Pitch

​​Producer:​​ Your pitch for a documentary on the present day, viewed from a future century, is fascinating. It's a contemporary take on history.

​​Director:​​ Thank you. I want to capture the modern era – not just the major annual events, but the daily lives of people. What will seem medieval to viewers a millennium from now?

​​Researcher:​​ Initially, we'll focus on the preceding decade to set the precedent. Then we'll move to the ongoing stories. The challenge is the everlasting relevance. We need to be up-to-date until the moment we finish.

​​Producer:​​ The duration is ambitious – a yearly update for the next century? That's a billion seconds of footage!

​​Director:​​ (Laughs) Not literally! But we'll release a major film annually, with monthly online shorts. Meanwhile, our team will work consecutively on each installment. The first is imminent – we start shooting immediately.

​​Producer:​​ This could be the dawn of a new form of historical record. I'm in. Let's make it permanent.

== The Wedding Anniversary Surprise

​​Spouse A:​​ I can't believe it's our annual anniversary already! It feels like just a moment ago we were planning the wedding. A dozen years have passed in an instant!

​​Spouse B:​​ I know! Time flies. I want this year to be special. I'm planning something for the present moment, but it's a secret. You'll find out immediately at midnight.

​​Spouse A:​​ Ooh, a surprise! Meanwhile, I've been working on something permanent for us – a modern art piece commemorating our era together. It'll be finished daily, piece by piece.

​​Spouse B:​​ That sounds everlasting! But please, be punctual for dinner tonight. No working overnight! The preceding few anniversaries, you were stuck at work. This year, I want you present, not just physically but mentally.

​​Spouse A:​​ I promise. I'll be there the moment you need me. Incidentally, I've already taken the day off. My priority is us, first and foremost.

​​Spouse B:​​ Finally! I'm so excited. This will be the best anniversary yet, I just know it.

== The Conference Keynote Speech

​​Organizer:​​ Firstly, I'd like to welcome you all to the opening of our annual conference. Secondly, I must remind you that we have simultaneous translation services available.

​​Keynote Speaker:​​ Thank you. Prior to my talk, I want to acknowledge my former colleagues at the Institute. The preceding research we did forms the basis of today's presentation.

​​Organizer:​​ Excellent. We'll have a Q&A session immediately after. Please be punctual, as we have a tight schedule. The duration of the talk should be exactly one hour.

​​Keynote Speaker:​​ Understood. I'll finish on time. Meanwhile, feel free to use the app for real-time questions. It's a modern system, very up-to-date.

​​Organizer:​​ Wonderful. And incidentally, the recording will be available permanently online from tomorrow. Now, the moment has arrived. Please begin.

== The Tech Startup Pitch

​​Investor:​​ So, your company's headquarters is situated in Canada, but you're recommending we install a new circuit board design. Can you explain the optics?

​​Founder:​​ Absolutely. We've distilled our research into this high-definition sensor mould. It's not science fiction; it's reliable technology. We're due to depart from traditional methods and pave a new way.

​​Investor:​​ Interesting. But I'm bound by certain criteria. There's controversy around some claims in this field. I've heard mutterings about competitors accusing others of trying to steal ideas.

​​Founder:​​ We would never deceive investors! Our methods are just and regulated. We possess the accreditations to prove it. We encourage transparency.

​​Investor:​​ Good. I recommend you lay out the tax implications. Now, about your supply chain for these goods... is it reliable? I'd hate to see you humiliate yourselves with a product recall.

== The Home Renovation Project

​​Homeowner:​​ I'm homesick for the way this living room used to look. We need to install new layers on these eaves. The plaster is due for an update; it's starting to descend in chunks.

​​Contractor:​​ I can counter that. We'll need to found a new support beam first. I recommend we regulate the moisture levels before we pave the way for new drywall. I'm bound by code to plumb this correctly.

​​Homeowner:​​ Just don't bury the costs! I don't possess a fortune. I endowed this project with my savings, but I might need to donate some goods to afford it.

​​Contractor:​​ (Laughs) No need to descend into fury! We'll use reliable materials. No controversy, I promise. Let's not offend the budget gods.

== The Music Festival Planning

​​Organizer A:​​ For the well-being of our attendees, we need to regulate the sound levels. We don't want to offend the neighbors with our hip-hop stage.

​​Organizer B:​​ True. But we also can't let well-known artists like DJ Devil Descend mutter about poor acoustics. We need reliable equipment. I recommend we install a high-definition system.

​​Organizer A:​​ Agreed. And we must declare all goods we import. Remember the controversy last year when customs found those x-rated cosmetics in a carry-on? We don't want that fury again.

​​Organizer B:​​ Absolutely. Let's pave the way for a smooth event. I'll donate my billiards table for the VIP area. It might conquer their boredom between sets.

== The International Charity Gala

​​Host:​​ Welcome, everyone, from Britain, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand... thank you for your possess... I mean, passion! We're here to encourage donations to endow a new science centre.

​​Celebrity Guest:​​ I'm just happy to descend from my helicopter to support this. I recommend we regulate how funds are used. We must be reliable stewards.

​​Host:​​ Absolutely. And we declare that all goods auctioned tonight are accredited. No stolen art! That would be a controversy of devilish proportions!

​​Celebrity Guest:​​ (Laughs) Well, I might donate my well-known jeans from my last film. They're bound to generate some fury... I mean, funds!

​​Host:​​ Wonderful! And for the living room set we're auctioning, it's situated in a lovely home in Canada. Now, let's not mutter about taxes; that's a boring counter to philanthropy.

== The Political Scandal Exposé

​​Journalist:​​ The controversy is due to explode. We have evidence that the Minister tried to steal goods and accept a bribe. He used his might to conquer any counter-arguments.

​​Editor:​​ This is bound to cause fury. But we must be just. Are the criteria for accusation met? Did he truly deceive the public? We can't publish based on a mutter.

​​Journalist:​​ We're reliable. We found the paper trail. He attempted to rob the public funds to endow a private account. It's a suicide mission for his career.

​​Editor:​​ If this is true, it will humiliate the entire party. It might even offend the very ideology of socialism they claim to uphold. Legislators will have to act.

​​Journalist:​​ It's all here. He's a thief in every sense. Now, should we descend into the details, or pave the way for a broader story about systemic corruption?

== The Extreme Sports Documentary

​​Director:​​ This scene where the skate star descends by parachute is high-definition gold! But the optics of having him jump from a helicopter are controversial. The safety criteria are bound to be questioned.

​​Producer:​​ We can't have him offend the safety regulators. But it's reliable footage. He's a well-known daredevil. He might just conquer his fear.

​​Athlete:​​ I'm due for this jump. I'm not going to mutter excuses. I possess the skill. Just don't bury the shot if I look humiliated!

​​Director:​​ Never! We'll install cameras on the rail he'll skate afterwards. We'll pave the way for an amazing sequence. It's not science fiction; it's real.

​​Producer:​​ Just remember, if anything happens, we don't want a suicide on film. Regulate the risk. His well-being is paramount.

== The Archaeology Discovery

​​Lead Archaeologist:​​ We found something incredible buried here. It might conquer our previous understanding of the era. This artifact seems to descend from a previously unknown culture.

​​Assistant:​​ It's bound to cause controversy in the academic community. The criteria for dating this will be debated with fury. We must be just in our analysis.

​​Lead Archaeologist:​​ Indeed. We cannot deceive ourselves. We need to install a proper lab on site to distil the facts. This isn't some science fiction story; it's real history.

​​Assistant:​​ Look at this mould for making tools. It's situated in a layer that suggests advanced technology. It's enough to make one homesick for a time they never knew.

​​Lead Archaeologist:​​ (Chuckles) Don't get too poetic. We have to regulate our excitement. But I recommend we accredit this find properly. This could humiliate some long-held theories.

== The Factory Closure Meeting

​​Union Rep:​​ The lay-off of a dozen workers just before the holidays? That's a cruel ax to fall. It's bound to cause fury. We need to curb this decision.

​​Manager:​​ The company's finances have expired. We're bound by the parent company's criteria. It's not a cheat; it's an unfortunate accident of the market.

​​Union Rep:​​ Don't try to deceive us with that religion of profit! This will humiliate hard-working families. I might just recommend a strike.

​​Manager:​​ That would be an offense we can't counter. Let's not mutter threats. We need an egalitarian solution, not a communist-style takeover! We can't just pirate the funds from another division.

​​Worker:​​ (Enters) Sir, there's been an accident on the line. The dial on the press broke, and a pair of scissors got caught in the mould. We had to use an ax to cut the power. The goods are ruined.

​​Manager:​​ (Sighs) See? Everything is falling apart. It's like the devil himself is against us. Fine, I'll delay the lay-offs. But we need to find a way to make up the losses, and fast.

== The Neighborhood Dispute

​​Homeowner:​​ I need to reinforce the fence. My new father-in-law says my neighbour's tree branches are trespassing on my property. They're hanging over the eaves of my living room.

​​Neighbor:​​ Each one of those branches is situated on my side! And your father-in-law is always trespassing to complain about something. Last week it was about my jeans hanging on the line!

​​Homeowner:​​ This isn't just about the branches. It's about respect. My living room is my sanctuary. And those cosmetics you sell from your home? The make-up stains on your carry-on bag ended up on my trousers last time you traveled!

​​Neighbor:​​ That was an accident! And you're one to talk. I'm bound to report you if you don't meet the criteria for noise levels. It's not just; my well-being is affected!

​​Homeowner:​​ Fine. Let's elect a neighborhood committee to resolve this. We can't go on like this, at each other's throats.

== The Airport Layoff Protest

​​Laid-off Worker:​​ This lay-off is not just! What are the criteria? I've been a loyal employee for years, carrying goods back and forth. Now I'm due for nothing?

​​Union Rep:​​ We will resist this. The company is bound by law to provide a fair process. We need to reinforce our position. Each worker's well-being is at stake.

​​Steward:​​ Please, passengers are trying to get through. This protest is trespassing on airport property.

​​Laid-off Worker:​​ We're not trespassing! We have a right to be here. My father-in-law worked here too; this job supports families across the neighbourhood.

​​Union Rep:​​ Exactly. We're carrying the banner for everyone. We won't go until they give us a just answer. Our resolve is like an arrow; it only moves forward.

== The International Business Meeting

​​CEO (France):​​ Our new line of cosmetics is due for launch. The goods are situated in warehouses in New Zealand already.

​​Marketing Head (Spanish):​​ We need to reinforce our marketing in each market. The criteria for success are different. For example, Spanish customers prefer natural make-up, while in France, it's more about elegance.

​​CEO:​​ My father-in-law, who's on the board, is bound to ask about the carry-on size for samples. He's very detail-oriented.

​​Marketing Head:​​ The well-being of our brand is paramount. We can't have any trespass on our intellectual property. We must resist copycats. Our strategy must be as straight as an arrow.

​​CEO:​​ Just so. Let's check the atlas for distribution routes. We need to ensure our jeans and trousers lines are also launched smoothly. The living room of global fashion is competitive!

== The Film Set Drama

​​Director:​​ Cut! This scene isn't working. Our lead actress looks disgusted, not tender. She's marrying her co-star, remember? You need to flatter him with your eyes, not vex him!

​​Actress:​​ I'm sorry, I'm just sore from kneeling in the last take. This fake beard is annoying, and these cosmetics make my skin swell. I feel like I might have a heart attack!

​​Surgeon (on set as consultant):​​ That's unlikely. But your health care on set should be better. A physician should be present. Meanwhile, your grandfather in this scene needs to look less stiff.

​​Grandfather Actor:​​ My knees are broken! I played a cripple in my preceding film, and my diabetes is acting up. This is embarrassing.

​​Director:​​ First, let's get an up-to-date X-ray for our actress. Someone vaccinate this set against negativity! This is science fiction, not a veterinary drama! Comrade, connect with your inner prophet! Let's take five.

== The Political Scandal

​​Chancellor:​​ This is a decimation of our reputation! The former Chancellor is a comrade who legislated strict criteria for our well-being. Now, they say he took bribes in cosmetics and jeans!

​​Aide:​​ The goods were situated in his father-in-law's living room. Each pair of trousers had an X-rated label! The press will have a field day. We're due for an election, and this might oppress our chances.

​​Chancellor:​​ I'm disappointed. We were born into this party to serve, not to kidnap public trust. My surname means "just" in our language! This scandal makes me want to retire to New Zealand and play billiards.

​​Aide:​​ Sir, please. We must act. The whistleblower, a well-known veterinary surgeon, is about to release high-definition optics of the carry-on bags full of cash. We need a plan, not self-pity.

== The Family Intervention

​​Daughter:​​ Dad, your diabetes is out of control. You had a heart attack last year! You can't keep eating like this. It's not just about you; it affects each of us. Your well-being is our priority.

​​Father:​​ I know, I know. But my grandfather lived to be a hundred, and he ate bacon daily! I'm not inclined to repeat all this health care nagging. It tires me.

​​Mother:​​ He's right. But meanwhile, your father-in-law is in the hospital with a broken hip from a fall. He's sore and swollen. The physician said it's due to poor bone density. We need to be strict with our diets.

​​Son:​​ And I'm studying to be a veterinary surgeon, not a people doctor! But even I know you need to vaccinate against flu and get regular X-rays. Don't disappoint us. We're here to bless you, not annoy you.

​​Father:​​ (Sighs) Fine. You've broken my spirit. I'll try to be tender with my health. But no more talk of cosmetics and make-up for men! That's a disgusting trend!

== The Art Gallery Opening

​​Art Critic:​​ This piece is astounding. The glitter and flare in the optics... it's like high-definition hip-hop made visible! The artist, a well-known whistler from Canada, uses a hammer and scissors to create these assorted patterns.

​​Gallery Owner:​​ We're due for a grand opening. Each piece is situated to connect with the viewer. The preceding artist used to kidnap images from science fiction, but this is born from pure emotion.

​​Artist:​​ Thank you. I was inspired by my grandfather, a prophet in his own right. He used to say, "Art should bless, not oppress." I hope my work doesn't embarrass anyone.

​​Visitor:​​ It's magnificent! But that one painting of the kneeled figure with a beard... it seems to decimate the notion of traditional portraiture. It's almost X-rated in its honesty!

​​Artist:​​ (Laughs) That was my father-in-law! He's a good sport.

== The Airport Security Incident

​​Security Officer:​​ Sir, I need to check your carry-on. The X-ray shows an assortment of items that don't meet our criteria. These cosmetics bottles are over 100ml, and this hammer is strictly prohibited.

​​Passenger:​​ But I'm a groom on my way to my wedding in New Zealand! I need the make-up for the photos! And the hammer is for a traditional blessing ceremony! My surname means "builder"!

​​Security Officer:​​ I'm sorry, but each passenger is bound by these rules for everyone's well-being. Meanwhile, your trousers have a suspicious bulge. Are those scissors? This is vexing.

​​Passenger:​​ They're for cutting the wedding cake! Look, my father-in-law is a retired chancellor, and my grandfather was a veterinary surgeon! I'm not a kidnapper!

​​Security Officer:​​ Sir, please don't embarrass yourself. I'm just doing my job. You might miss your flight if we don't resolve this. I'm not here to oppress you, but to protect.

== The Coal Mine Protest

​​Union Leader:​​ The lay-off of a hundred miners is unjust! My father-in-law worked this mine for decades. Each injury, each broken bone, was for the company's goods. Now they toss us aside?

​​Miner:​​ It's disgusting! They bow to their celebrity investors while we risk our lives. The dust makes our lungs sore; it's like a minute heart attack every day. My grandfather was a communist who fought for our well-being!

​​Company Rep:​​ Please, the mine is situated on unstable land. The preceding reports show it's due to collapse. We're not here to oppress you. The criteria for safety are strict. We must legislate for the future.

​​Miner's Wife:​​ Meanwhile, our living room is full of worry! You talk about high-definition optics for your new offices, but you can't see the pain in our eyes? My husband might be injured next! This isn't science fiction; it's our life!

​​Union Leader:​​ We won't kneel! We'll fight this like comrades! Our resolve is not minute; it's massive!
