== A Hike in the Hills

Alex: Wow, look at this landscape! The terrain is so rough and stony.

Beth: It is splendid. But be careful, the slope is very steep here. Don't go near the cliff edge.

Alex: I will. Look at that valley down there. The weather is so mild today. The forecast said no stormy downpour.

Beth: Yes, the breeze is nice. But the altitude is increasing. Can you feel the temperature drop? It's getting chilly.

Alex: A little. I hope my phone battery doesn't deteriorate in the cold. The surroundings are so peaceful. It feels very remote.

Beth: Absolutely. It's the opposite of urban life. No smog, no pollution. Just nature.

Alex: And that stream we passed? The water was so clear, not muddy at all. Its source must be pure.

Beth: True. This grand wilderness is a great environment to relax in.

一次山地徒步

Alex: 哇，看这风景！这地形真崎岖，而且多石。

Beth: 太壮观了。但是小心点，这里的斜坡很陡。别靠近悬崖边缘。

Alex: 我会的。看下面的那个山谷。今天天气真温和。天气预报说没有暴雨。

Beth: 是的，微风很舒服。但是海拔在升高。你能感觉到温度下降吗？有点变冷了。

Alex: 有一点。希望我的手机电池不会在低温下恶化。周围环境真宁静。感觉非常偏远。

Beth: 绝对是的。这和城市生活正好相反。没有烟雾，没有污染。只有大自然。

Alex: 我们经过的那条小溪？水真清澈，一点不浑浊。它的源头一定很纯净。

Beth: 没错。这宏伟的荒野是个放松的好环境。

== The Coastal Watch

Chris: The tide is coming in. The sea is rough today.

Dana: Yes, the waves are big. Look at the current. It's strong. This coast can be dangerous.

Chris: I read about a tsunami warning system. It's crucial for marine navigation and coastal safety.

Dana: Absolutely. A tsunami would be catastrophic. It's a natural disaster we must respect.

Chris: The beach is sandy here, but see those pebbles? They're smooth from the water.

Dana: Yeah. The horizon is so clear. You can see the gulf in the distance. The sunset will be magnificent later.

Chris: I hope so. But those clouds look dense. Maybe a shower is coming.

Dana: Maybe. Let's check the meteorology app. I don't want to get caught in a downpour.

海岸观察

Chris: 涨潮了。今天海面很不平静。

Dana: 是的，浪很大。看那水流，很急。这片海岸可能很危险。

Chris: 我读过关于海啸预警系统的文章。它对海洋航行和海岸安全至关重要。

Dana: 绝对是的。海啸将是灾难性的。这是我们必须要尊重的自然灾害。

Chris: 这里的海滩是沙质的，但看到那些鹅卵石了吗？被水冲得很光滑。

Dana: 是啊。地平线真清晰。可以看到远处的海湾。待会儿的日落会很壮观。

Chris: 希望如此。但那些云看起来很厚。也许要下阵雨了。

Dana: 可能吧。我们查一下气象应用。我可不想被暴雨困住。

'''

== The Science Class Discussion

Prof. Lee: Today, we discuss Earth's spheres. The atmosphere contains oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Student: What about the hydrosphere? And the lithosphere?

Prof. Lee: Good. The hydrosphere is all water. The lithosphere is the rigid outer layer, including the crust and upper mantle.

Student: And the core is very hot, right? Is that thermodynamic heat?

Prof. Lee: Exactly. Now, minerals like quartz and granite are found in the lithosphere. Marble is a metamorphic rock.

Student: And ores contain valuable minerals. But mining can degrade the environment.

Prof. Lee: Correct. It can cause erosion and pollution. Toxic pollutants can contaminate the soil.

Student: So, we need to protect our natural surroundings.

科学课讨论

Prof. Lee: 今天，我们讨论地球的圈层。大气层包含氧气和二氧化碳。

Student: 那水圈呢？还有岩石圈？

Prof. Lee: 问得好。水圈是所有水体的总称。岩石圈是坚硬的外层，包括地壳和上地幔。

Student: 地核很热，对吧？那是热力学热量吗？

Prof. Lee: 正是。现在，像石英和花岗岩这样的矿物是在岩石圈中发现的。大理石是一种变质岩。

Student: 矿石含有有价值的矿物。但采矿会恶化环境。

Prof. Lee: 正确。它可能导致侵蚀和污染。有毒污染物会污染土壤。

Student: 所以，我们需要保护我们的自然环境。

== The Unpredictable Weather

Emma: This weather is so abnormal for spring. It was warm yesterday, now it's frigid.

Frank: I know! I'm starting to shiver. There was frost this morning. I hope the plants don't freeze.

Emma: Me too. And last week's hail was dramatic. The downpour caused some flooding in the suburbs.

Frank: Yes, the streams overflowed. The meteorology office said this irregularly cold snap is due to a climate phenomenon.

Emma: Maybe like El Nino? It affects global weather patterns. It can cause drought in some areas and torrential rain in others.

Frank: Exactly. It's a destructive force of nature. We need to check the forecast more often.

变幻莫测的天气

Emma: 这天气对于春天来说太反常了。昨天还很暖和，现在却冷得要命。

Frank: 我知道！我都开始发抖了。今天早上有霜冻。希望植物不会冻坏。

Emma: 我也是。上周的冰雹真够戏剧性的。那场暴雨导致郊区有些地方淹水了。

Frank: 是啊，小溪都泛滥了。气象局说这次不规律的寒流是由于某种气候现象。

Emma: 像厄尔尼诺现象吗？它影响全球天气模式。它可能导致一些地区干旱，另一些地区暴雨成灾。

Frank: 正是。它是一种具有破坏性的自然力量。我们需要更经常查看天气预报。

== The Geological Survey

Dr. Gray: This terrain is fascinating. See these sediment layers? They're full of silt and clay.

Assistant: Yes. And over there, a crack in the plate. This whole region is seismically active. The risk of an earthquake is inevitable in the long term.

Dr. Gray: Unfortunately, yes. An earthquake could trigger an avalanche on that mountain range. Look at the debris from previous slides.

Assistant: The slope is unstable. The rock is barren and eroding. Water erosion has made it sandy and weak.

Dr. Gray: Our analysis must be intensive. We need to understand the geology to assess the catastrophic risk.

地质调查

Dr. Gray: 这地形真迷人。看到这些沉积层了吗？它们充满了泥沙和粘土。

Assistant: 是的。那边，板块有一个裂缝。这整个区域都是地震活跃区。长期来看，发生地震的风险是不可避免的。

Dr. Gray: 不幸的是，是的。地震可能引发那条山脉上的雪崩。看以前滑坡留下的碎屑。

Assistant: 斜坡不稳定。岩石贫瘠且正在被侵蚀。水的侵蚀使它变得沙化而脆弱。

Dr. Gray: 我们的分析必须深入。我们需要了解地质情况以评估灾难性风险。

'''

== The Plan for the Weekend

George: What's the plan for the weekend? The forecast looks super. Sunshine and mild temperatures.

Helen: I was thinking of a trip to the peninsula. The scenery is interesting there. We can walk along the shore.

George: Great idea! Is it adjacent to the mainland by a narrow isthmus?

Helen: Yes, it's a narrow strip of land. The coast has sandy beaches and stony coves. We might see an oasis of fresh water.

George: Perfect. I'll pack a picnic. We can watch the sunrise over the ocean. It's a splendid way to relax.

周末计划

George: 周末有什么计划？天气预报看起来棒极了。阳光明媚，温度适宜。

Helen: 我在想去半岛旅行。那里的风景很有趣。我们可以沿着海岸散步。

George: 好主意！它是通过一个狭窄的地峡与大陆相邻的吗？

Helen: 是的，是一块狭长的土地。海岸有沙质海滩和多石的小海湾。我们可能会看到淡水绿洲。

George: 太完美了。我会准备野餐。我们可以看海上日出。这是放松的好方法。

'''

== The Environmental Concern

Ian: The air quality is bad today. So much smog. You can almost taste the fumes.

Jenny: I know. The pollution level is toxic. It's aggravating my throat. This haze is a mix of mist and pollutants.

Ian: It's the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide and other gases trap heat. The climate is deteriorating.

Jenny: And it seems irreversible. The polar ice caps are melting. The globe is warming.

Ian: We need to switch to solar energy, away from petrol and gasoline. It's an inevitable change.

Jenny: I agree. For our environment and future.

环境担忧

Ian: 今天空气质量很差。这么多烟雾。你几乎能尝到废气的味道。

Jenny: 我知道。污染水平是有毒的。它让我的喉咙更不舒服了。这薄雾是雾和污染物的混合物。

Ian: 这是温室效应。二氧化碳和其他气体困住了热量。气候正在恶化。

Jenny: 而且看起来是不可逆转的。极地冰盖在融化。全球在变暖。

Ian: 我们需要转向太阳能，远离汽油。这是一个不可避免的改变。

Jenny: 我同意。为了我们的环境和未来。

'''

== The Stormy Night

Katie: Did you hear that thunder? The lightning is flashing like crazy.

Leo: Yes, it's stormy out there. The wind is a real gale. It's not just a breeze anymore. I hope it doesn't become a hurricane.

Katie: The weather report said it's just a severe storm. But the rain is pouring down. The drains can't handle it. There might be flooding.

Leo: Look at the puddles. The water is dripping from the ceiling! This is a mishap we didn't need.

Katie: At least we're safe inside. Let's hope the power doesn't go out.

暴风雨之夜

Katie: 你听到那雷声了吗？闪电闪得厉害。

Katie: 至少我们在里面是安全的。希望不要停电。

'''

== The Geography Lesson

Mr. Clark: Can anyone point to the equator on this globe?

Student: Here, sir. It's the line at zero degrees latitude.

Mr. Clark: Correct. And what about the prime meridian, for longitude?

Student: That's this line here, through Greenwich. It divides the eastern and western hemispheres.

Mr. Clark: Good. Now, the Arctic is at the North Pole, and the Antarctic is at the South Pole. The axis of the Earth runs through them.

Student: And Oceania is in the Pacific Ocean, mostly in the southern hemisphere. Is that right?

Mr. Clark: Yes, that's right. Asia is mainly in the northern hemisphere.

地理课

== The Desert Adventure

Mike: This desert is so arid. Not a drop of water in sight. The land is barren.

Nina: I know. The heat is intense. We need to find an oasis soon. My water bottle is almost empty.

Mike: Look at those sand dunes. They're sandy and flat on top. The sunshine is brutal. We need some shade.

Nina: There's a rock formation over there. Maybe we can find some shade and rest. I see a small spring!

Mike: Fantastic! An oasis! The water must evaporate quickly in this heat, but it's a lifesaver now.

沙漠冒险

Mike: 这沙漠真干旱。一滴水也看不见。土地贫瘠。

Nina: 我知道。热浪强烈。我们需要尽快找到绿洲。我的水壶快空了。

Mike: 看那些沙丘。顶部是沙质平坦的。阳光很残酷。我们需要一点阴凉处。

Nina: 那边有个岩层。也许我们能找到阴凉处休息一下。我看到一个小泉！

Mike: 太棒了！一个绿洲！水在这种高温下一定蒸发得很快，但现在是救命的。

== The Mountain Expedition

Olivia: We're near the peak. The altitude is making me lightheaded. The air is thin.

Peter: Take it slow. The ridge is just ahead. From there, we can overlook the whole valley. The view will be magnificent.

Olivia: I hope so. The slope was very steep on the southern side. The northern side was more gradual.

Peter: Yes. This mountain range has some wilderness areas that are still remote and desolate.

Olivia: It's so quiet. Just the sound of the wind gusting around the cliffs. It's a grand feeling.

登山探险

Olivia: 我们接近山顶了。海拔让我头晕。空气稀薄。

Peter: 慢点来。山脊就在前面。从那里，我们可以俯瞰整个山谷。景色会很壮观。

Olivia: 希望如此。南坡非常陡峭。北坡更平缓一些。

Peter: 是的。这条山脉有一些荒野地区仍然偏远荒凉。

Olivia: 真安静。只有风在悬崖周围呼啸的声音。这是一种宏大的感觉。

'''

== The Factory Visit

QA Manager: We've upgraded our system to reduce toxic fume emissions. We can't jeopardise the local environment.

Visitor: That's good. The surrounding area had issues with pollution. The river was contaminated with chemical debris.

QA Manager: We know. It was inappropriate and we're fixing it. We now use an advanced filter system. The water from our plant is cleaner than the source.

Visitor: I'm glad to hear it. Preventing pollution is better than dealing with a catastrophic event later.

参观工厂

== The Conversation about Materials

Anna: This table is made of synthetic material. It looks like marble but it's artificial.

Ben: Really? It feels smooth. Real marble is heavy and cold. This is light. Is it plastic?

Anna: I think it's a composite material. Over there, we have a granite countertop. That's natural stone. It's very hard.

Ben: And the magnet sticks to the fridge, which is metal. But it won't stick to the quartz worktop.

Anna: Of course not. Quartz is a mineral, not a metal. Different materials have different properties.

关于材料的对话

Anna: 这张桌子是合成材料做的。看起来像大理石，但是人造的。

Ben: 真的吗？摸起来很光滑。真的大理石很重而且凉。这个很轻。是塑料吗？

Anna: 我想是复合材料。那边，我们有一个花岗岩台面。那是天然石头。很硬。

Ben: 磁铁能吸在冰箱上，冰箱是金属的。但它不会吸在石英台面上。

Anna: 当然不会。石英是矿物，不是金属。不同的材料有不同的特性。

== The River Study

Ecolgist: This brook is shallow here. You can see the stony bottom. Further down, it joins a larger stream.

Student: The water is very clear. Not muddy. What are those bubbles? Is it a spring?

Ecolgist: Good eye! It's a fountain of groundwater coming up. The water circulates through the aquifer and emerges here.

Student: And then it flows downstream to the river. Does it evaporate into vapour too?

Ecolgist: Yes, especially on hot days. Then it precipitates as rain elsewhere. The cycle continues.

河流研究

生态学家: 这条小溪这里很浅。你可以看到多石的底部。再往下，它汇入一条更大的溪流。

Student: 水很清澈。不浑浊。那些气泡是什么？是泉水吗？

生态学家: 好眼力！是地下水涌上来的泉。水通过蓄水层循环，在这里涌出。

Student: 然后它向下游流到河里。它也会蒸发成水蒸气吗？

生态学家: 是的，尤其是在热天。然后它在别处凝结成雨落下。循环继续。

'''

== The Ocean Currents

Captain: The ocean currents here are strong. They affect global climate. The Gulf Stream, for example, keeps Europe warm.

Scientist: Yes, and the Pacific has the El Nino phenomenon. It can cause drought in Australia and flooding in South America.

Captain: It's amazing how connected everything is. The Atlantic and Mediterranean have their own current systems too.

Scientist: Absolutely. Marine navigation relies on understanding these currents. They are like rivers in the sea.

'''

== The Problem of Erosion

Farmer: The soil erosion on this hillside is bad. The topsoil is washing away. The land is becoming barren.

Agronomist: You need to plant trees. Deforestation has made the slope vulnerable to torrential rain. The sediment ends up in the river, making it muddy.

Farmer: I know. We need to fertilise the land to make it fertile again. But it's a slow process.

Agronomist: It is. But preventing further degradation is key. We must work with nature, not against it.

侵蚀问题

Farmer: 这面山坡的土壤侵蚀很严重。表土被冲走了。土地变得贫瘠。

Agronomist: 你需要种树。 deforestation 使斜坡容易受到暴雨侵袭。沉积物最终进入河流，使其变得浑浊。

Farmer: 我知道。我们需要给土地施肥，让它再次变得肥沃。但这是个缓慢的过程。

Agronomist: 是的。但防止进一步退化是关键。我们必须与自然合作，而不是对抗它。

'''

== The Water Cycle Explained

Teacher: The water cycle is essential. Water evaporates from the ocean, forms clouds, and precipitates as rain.

Pupil: And then it flows downstream in rivers back to the sea?

Teacher: Yes, or it seeps into the ground to become groundwater, stored in aquifers. Sometimes it emerges as a spring.

Pupil: So the water in this reservoir could have been vapour last week! It's a continuous circulation.

水循环解释

Teacher: 水循环是必不可少的。水从海洋蒸发，形成云，然后以雨的形式降水。

Pupil: 然后它通过河流下游流回大海？

Teacher: 是的，或者它渗入地下成为地下水，储存在蓄水层中。有时它以泉的形式出现。

Pupil: 所以这个水库里的水上星期可能还是水蒸气！这是一个持续的循环。

Leo: Dude, you said this hike would be "moderate." My legs feel like jelly. This is the opposite of moderate.

Sam: Oh, stop being so dramatic. Look! A hot spring! The water is gushing out of the rock. Must be thermal heating.

Leo: Thermal? Like, from magma? Are we on a volcano? Is this thing gonna erupt? Because my situation is already catastrophic enough.

Sam: (Laughing) It's not a volcano. Probably. The water's just warm. Very... thermal. Come on, get in. It'll be heaven.

Leo: Heaven? It looks like a swamp. And what's that smell? Like rotten eggs. Is that carbon dioxide or just you?

Sam: Very funny. That's the smell of... minerals. Good for you. Don't be so superficial. It's not about the looks.

Leo: Easy for you to say. You're already in. Whoa! The current is strong! It's like a horizontal waterfall! Don't let the torrent carry you away!

Sam: Don't worry! If you drown, I'll tell everyone you bravely fought a... a water puff. A mighty water puff.

== The Weather Channel Gone Wild

Chloe: The weather forecast is insane. A typhoon is approaching from the southwest.

Max: A typhoon? Here? I thought we just got monsoons. And the occasional tornado to keep things interesting.

Chloe: This is different. The meteorologist said the intensity is due to El Nino. It's creating abnormal conditions in the tropics.

Max: Great. So we'll have torrential rainfall. The streets will flood. My car might float away. Again.

Chloe: Look on the bright side. If your car floats away, you'll have an excuse to buy that new jeep you've been eyeing on the margin of your browser.

Max: True. And if a glacier somehow appears, we can use it to cool our drinks. Think positive!

Chloe: That's the spirit! We can build an ark. Just two of every animal... starting with us.

天气频道疯了

Chloe: 天气预报太疯狂了。一场台风正从西南方向逼近。

Max: 台风？这里？我以为我们只有季风。偶尔来个龙卷风增加点趣味。

Chloe: 这次不一样。气象学家说强度是因为厄尔尼诺现象。它在热带地区造成了异常状况。

Max: 太好了。所以我们会有暴雨。街道会淹水。我的车可能又会漂走。

Chloe: 往好处想。如果你的车漂走了，你就有借口买你一直在浏览器边缘看的那辆新吉普车了。

Max: 没错。如果 somehow 出现个冰川，我们可以用它来冰镇饮料。往积极的方面想！

Chloe: 这就对了！我们可以造一艘方舟。每样动物带两只…从我们开始。

== The Geography Bee Blunder

Quiz Host: Next question! Which continent contains the largest desert?

Contestant A (Anna): That's easy! Africa! The Sahara!

Contestant B (Ben): Wait, I think Antarctica is technically a cold desert. And it's bigger. So, Antarctica!

Anna: Oh, come on! That's a trick question! It's a frozen desert! A glacier desert! It's not sandy!

Ben: A desert is defined by low rainfall, not sand. Check the definition in the margin of your textbook, Anna.

Quiz Host: Ben is correct! The Antarctic plateau is the largest desert. Next question: The Nile Delta is in which direction from the Atlas Mountains?

Anna: (Groans) Northeast? Southeast? I give up. My knowledge has a huge gap. A Ben-sized gap.

Ben: Don't be salty. It's clearly northeast. But thanks for the compliment about my size.

地理知识竞赛乌龙

Quiz Host: 下一个问题！哪个大陆有最大的沙漠？

Contestant A (Anna): 太简单了！非洲！撒哈拉沙漠！

Contestant B (Ben): 等等，我觉得南极洲在技术上讲是个寒冷的沙漠。而且它更大。所以是南极洲！

Anna: 哦，得了吧！这是个陷阱题！那是个冰冻的沙漠！冰川沙漠！它不是沙质的！

Ben: 沙漠的定义是低降水量，不是沙子。安娜，看看你课本页边的定义。

Quiz Host: 本回答正确！南极高原是最大的沙漠。下一个问题：尼罗河三角洲位于阿特拉斯山脉的哪个方向？

Anna: （呻吟）东北？东南？我放弃。我的知识有个巨大的缺口。一个本那么大的缺口。

Ben: 别酸了。很明显是东北。不过谢谢你对我的尺寸的恭维。

== The Mountaineering Mishap

Ella: Okay, the map says the plateau is just beyond this ridge. We're almost at the mount.

Jake: My feet disagree. They think we're in the distant past, climbing an active volcano. Is it just me, or is it getting hotter?

Ella: It's the thermal underwear I made you wear. And that's not a volcano, it's just a steep, rocky slope. Stop being so dramatic.

Jake: I'm being dramatic? You're the one who wanted to "commune with nature." This feels less like communing and more like being attacked. Look at that vertical cliff! One strong gust of wind and I'm a pancake.

Ella: Oh, a little breeze won't blow you over. But maybe don't stand so close to the edge. We don't want to endanger the local bird population when you fall.

Jake: Very funny. Is that a waterfall? Thank heaven! Maybe it'll wash away your terrible sense of humor.

Ella: It's not a waterfall, it's just a drip. Probably just dew run-off. But look at the plain below! Splendid!

Jake: It is pretty. Almost worth the paralyzing fear. Almost.

登山小意外

Ella: 好了，地图上说高原就在这个山脊后面。我们快到山下了。

Jake: 我的脚不同意。它们觉得我们回到了遥远的过去，在爬一座活火山。是我的错觉，还是真的变热了？

Ella: 那是我让你穿的保暖内衣。而且那不是火山，只是个陡峭的石坡。别这么夸张。

Jake: 我夸张？你才是那个想“与大自然神交”的人。这感觉不像是神交，更像是被攻击。看那个垂直的悬崖！一阵强风我就成煎饼了。

Ella: 哦，一点小风不会把你吹倒的。不过也许别站得离边缘太近。我们可不想你掉下去的时候危及当地的鸟类种群。

Jake: 真好笑。那是个瀑布吗？谢天谢地！也许它能冲走你糟糕的幽默感。

Ella: 那不是瀑布，只是滴水。可能只是露水流下来的。但看下面的平原！太美了！

Jake: 是挺漂亮的。几乎值得这令人瘫痪的恐惧。几乎。

== The Art Critique

Art Critic (Mr. Vance): And this piece... it's interesting. The brushstrokes are parallel, but the subject matter is so... fringe.

Artist (Iris): Thank you! I was trying to capture the moment before dusk, when the light has a certain intensity.

Mr. Vance: Hmm. The colors are a bit... snowy. And the composition feels... swamp-like. It lacks depth. It's rather superficial.

Iris: Superficial? Sir, the layers of paint are anything but superficial! It's a commentary on the fragile gap between civilization and wilderness! The ever-present threat of a seismic shift in our values!

Mr. Vance: ...I was talking about the varnish. It hasn't been applied evenly. There's a drip right here. Looks like a tiny, petroleum-based tear.

Iris: Oh. That? That's... part of the piece. It's about the drowning of artistry in commercialism! Obviously.

Mr. Vance: Obviously. How much did you say this was again?

艺术评论

Art Critic (Mr. Vance): 而这幅作品…很有趣。笔触是平行的，但主题非常…非主流。

Artist (Iris): 谢谢！我试图捕捉黄昏前的时刻，那时光线有一种特别的强度。

Mr. Vance: 嗯。颜色有点…雪白。构图感觉…像沼泽。缺乏深度。相当肤浅。

Iris: 肤浅？先生，颜料的层次一点也不肤浅！这是对文明与荒野之间脆弱隔阂的评论！对我们价值观可能发生 seismic 转变的永恒威胁！

Mr. Vance: …我说的是清漆。涂得不均匀。这里有一滴。看起来像一滴小小的、石油基的眼泪。

Iris: 哦。那个？那是…作品的一部分。是关于艺术性在商业主义中的淹没！很明显。

Mr. Vance: 很明显。你刚才说这卖多少钱来着？

== The Ironic Picnic

Grace: Perfect day for a picnic! Sunny, a gentle breeze... must be about 25 degrees Celsius.

Tom: 25 Celsius? Feels hotter. Must be the greenhouse effect. All this carbon dioxide. Maybe we shouldn't have driven.

Grace: Oh, don't start. We're enjoying nature! Look at those beautiful trees to the northwest.

Tom: Yeah, beautiful. Did you know they're planning to deforest that entire area for a new shopping mall? "Oriental Garden Mall," they'll call it. Ironic, huh?

Grace: What? No! That's terrible! They can't! This is a natural paradise!

Tom: Tell me about it. Soon this'll just be a memory. Pass the potato salad. Let's eat before the bulldozers arrive.

Grace: Way to kill the mood, Tom. Now every bite tastes like... sawdust. And guilt.

Tom: You're welcome. Adds fiber.

讽刺的野餐

Grace: 野餐的绝佳天气！阳光明媚，微风和煦…大概25摄氏度左右。

Tom: 25摄氏度？感觉更热。肯定是温室效应。所有这些二氧化碳。也许我们不该开车的。

Grace: 哦，别开始说教了。我们在享受大自然！看西北边那些漂亮的树。

Tom: 是啊，漂亮。你知道他们计划砍掉那整个区域来建一个新的购物中心吗？他们会叫它“东方花园购物中心”。挺讽刺的，是吧？

Grace: 什么？不！太糟糕了！他们不能这样！这是个天然的天堂！

Tom: 就是啊。很快这就只是个回忆了。把土豆沙拉递给我。在推土机来之前我们赶紧吃吧。

Grace: 汤姆，你真扫兴。现在每一口吃起来都像…锯末。还有内疚。

Tom: 不客气。增加点纤维素。
