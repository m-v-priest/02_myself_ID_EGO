== The Parenting Challenge

​​Parent A:​​ I don't know how to react when he acts out. His behaviour is getting worse.

​​Parent B:​​ We need to reflect on our own actions. How do we respond to stress? Children often mirror what they see. We must bear that in mind.

​​Parent A:​​ I know. But when he throws a mess on the floor and scatters his toys, I just want to scold him. It's hard not to lose my temper.

​​Parent B:​​ Hasten slowly. Don't urge a quick fix. We adopted the policy of positive reinforcement for a reason. We need to nourish his good deeds with praise, not provoke him with anger.

​​Parent A:​​ So, when he helps to fold the laundry, I should applaud? Maybe even give him a hug?

​​Parent B:​​ Exactly! Catch him being good. Grab those moments. If you only peer at his mistakes, that's all you'll see. Take a step back and contemplate the whole picture.

​​Parent A:​​ It's just... sometimes I feel like I'm going to smash something. I need to learn to exhale.

​​Parent B:​​ We all do. Let's make a pledge to support each other. No more quarrels about parenting. We're in this together.

育儿挑战

​​家长A:​​ 我不知道当他行为不端时该如何反应。他的行为越来越糟。

​​家长B:​​ 我们需要反思自己的行为。我们如何应对压力？孩子常常有样学样。我们必须牢记这一点。

​​家长A:​​ 我知道。但当他把地上弄得一团糟，玩具撒得到处都是时，我就想责骂他。很难不发火。

​​家长B:​​ 欲速则不达。不要急于求成。我们采取积极强化的策略是有原因的。我们需要用赞美来培养他的良好行为，而不是用愤怒去激怒他。

​​家长A:​​ 所以，当他帮忙叠衣服时，我应该鼓掌？甚至拥抱他？

​​家长B:​​ 完全正确！抓住他表现好的时候。把握那些时刻。如果你只盯着他的错误，那你只会看到错误。退一步，审视全局。

​​家长A:​​ 只是……有时我觉得自己要气炸了。我需要学会呼气放松。

​​家长B:​​ 我们都一样。让我们发誓互相支持。不再为育儿问题争吵。我们共同面对。

== The Art Studio Critique

​​Art Teacher:​​ Gaze at this painting, but don't just stare. Contemplate the artist's intention. See how the brushstrokes seem to grasp at something intangible?

​​Student A:​​ I get a glimpse of sadness. It's like the artist is trying to fasten a feeling to the canvas.

​​Student B:​​ I see anger. The way the red is smashed across the blue... it feels like a quarrel, a dispute.

​​Art Teacher:​​ Good observations! Now, touch this sculpture. Feel the scratch of the stone. The artist didn't try to smooth it away. They wanted us to feel the texture, the struggle.

​​Student A:​​ It's hard to explain, but it makes me react strongly. It's not pretty, but it's powerful.

​​Art Teacher:​​ Art isn't always about beauty. Sometimes it's about provoking a response, urging us to think. This piece acts as a mirror, forcing us to reflect on our own lives.

​​Student B:​​ So, when we mock art we don't understand, we're really mocking our own inability to grasp its meaning?

​​Art Teacher:​​ Perhaps. Or we're just not accustomed to its language. Give it time. Let your intake of information settle before you exhale a judgment.

画室评论

​​艺术老师:​​ 凝视这幅画，但不要只是盯着看。思考艺术家的意图。看这些笔触如何试图抓住一些无形的东西？

​​学生A:​​ 我瞥见一丝悲伤。就像艺术家试图将一种感觉固定在画布上。

​​学生B:​​ 我看到愤怒。红色泼溅在蓝色上的方式……感觉像一场争吵，一场争论。

​​艺术老师:​​ 观察得很好！现在，触摸这座雕塑。感受石头的刮痕。艺术家没有试图磨平它。他们想让我们感受质地，感受挣扎。

​​学生A:​​ 很难解释，但它让我反应强烈。它不美，但很有力量。

​​艺术老师:​​ 艺术并不总是关于美。有时是为了激起反应，催促我们思考。这件作品充当一面镜子，迫使我們反思自己的生活。

​​学生B:​​ 所以，当我们嘲笑我们不理解的艺术时，我们实际上是在嘲笑自己无法理解其含义？

​​艺术老师:​​ 也许。或者我们只是不习惯它的语言。给它时间。在你做出判断之前，先让你接收的信息沉淀一下。

== The Courtroom Oath

​​Judge:​​ Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

​​Witness:​​ I do. This is my sacred vow. I will not swear falsely.

​​Prosecutor:​​ Thank you. Now, can you explain what you saw? Don't hurry. Take your time to reflect.

​​Witness:​​ I saw two men in a dispute. One seemed to provoke the other. Then, in a hurry, the first man grabbed a bottle and smashed it. I saw him twist the other's arm. It was a terrible thing to behold.

​​Defense Attorney:​​ Objection! The witness is asserting something he could not possibly have seen clearly from his vantage point. He may be accustomed to jumping to conclusions.

​​Judge:​​ Overruled. The witness may reply. But please, notify the court if you are unsure about any detail. We are here to ascertain the facts, not to boast or mock.

​​Witness:​​ I am sure. I had a clear gaze. It happened fast, but my mind grasped the sequence. I will not be teased into changing my story.

法庭誓言

​​法官:​​ 你是否发誓所说皆为事实，全部事实，除事实外别无他物？

​​证人:​​ 我发誓。这是我神圣的誓言。我不会发假誓。

​​检察官:​​ 谢谢。现在，你能解释一下你看到了什么吗？别着急。慢慢回想。

​​证人:​​ 我看到两个男人在争吵。一个似乎在挑衅另一个。然后，匆忙中，第一个男人抓起一个瓶子砸碎了。我看到他扭住了另一个人的胳膊。目睹这一切很可怕。

​​辩护律师:​​ 反对！证人断言了他从那个角度不可能看清的事情。他可能习惯于草率下结论。

​​法官:​​ 反对无效。证人可以回答。但如果你对任何细节不确定，请告知法庭。我们在这里是为了查明事实，而不是为了吹嘘或嘲弄。

​​证人:​​ 我确定。我看得很清楚。事情发生得很快，但我的大脑抓住了顺序。我不会被戏弄而改变说法。

== The Mountain Rescue

​​Rescue Leader:​​ We need to hasten our efforts. The lost hikers won't survive the night if we don't revive them soon. Their intake of calories must be low.

​​Volunteer A:​​ I glimpsed a flash of light over that ridge! Should we follow that direction?

​​Rescue Leader:​​ Peer carefully. Don't just stare. We can't afford to scatter our team. We must fasten our ropes and move together.

​​Volunteer B:​​ I'll try to catch a signal on the radio. I need everyone to be silent for a moment. (Exhales) Nothing. Just static.

​​Rescue Leader:​​ Don't lose hope. We adopted this search pattern for a reason. It's methodical. We must support each other. If you feel tired, tap your partner. We'll take a knee if we need to.

​​Volunteer A:​​ Look! I can see a figure! It's them! They're waving!

​​Rescue Leader:​​ Excellent! Grab the medical kits. Let's not provoke any avalanches by rushing, but we must hurry. Their lives depend on our next actions.

山地救援

​​救援队长:​​ 我们需要加快速度。如果不及早让失踪的徒步旅行者恢复体力，他们撑不过今晚。他们的热量摄入肯定很低。

​​志愿者A:​​ 我瞥见山脊那边有闪光！我们应该朝那个方向跟进吗？

​​救援队长:​​ 仔细察看。不要只是盯着看。我们不能分散队伍。必须系好绳子，一起行动。

​​志愿者B:​​ 我试试用无线电捕捉信号。大家安静一下。(呼气) 没有。只有静电。

​​救援队长:​​ 不要失去希望。我们采用这种搜索模式是有原因的。这是有条理的。必须互相支持。如果感到疲倦，轻拍你的伙伴。必要时我们可以跪下休息。

​​志愿者A:​​ 看！我看到一个人影！是他们！他们在挥手！

​​救援队长:​​ 太好了！抓住医疗包。不要因为匆忙而引发雪崩，但必须快点。他们的生命取决于我们接下来的行动。

'''

== The Rehearsal Room

​​Director:​​ From the top, everyone! And this time, behave like real actors, not amateurs! I need you to act with conviction!

​​Actor A:​​ (Sighs) How do you want me to react in this scene? When she mentions the letter, should I look surprised? Or should I pretend I already know?

​​Director:​​ Contemplate the subtext! Your character is accustomed to hiding his feelings. So, give us a glimpse of the truth, then fasten the mask back on. Don't just stare blankly!

​​Actor B:​​ And what about my line? "I vow to never return." Should I shout it? Or whisper it with menace?

​​Director:​​ Grab the emotion! Don't just scratch the surface. This is a pivotal moment. The audience needs to feel your grip on the character's despair.

​​Actor A:​​ Okay, okay. I'll try to grasp it better. No need to scold us.

​​Director:​​ I'm not scolding! I'm urging you to be better! This play will survive or perish based on your deeds tonight. Now, let's go again. And someone please wipe that mirror clean—I can't bear to see my own frustrated reflection!

排练室

​​导演:​​ 从头开始，各位！这次要表现得像真正的演员，不是业余的！我要你们带着信念表演！

​​演员A:​​ (叹气) 这场戏你想要我如何反应？当她提到那封信时，我该显得惊讶吗？还是该假装已经知道了？

​​导演:​​ 思考潜台词！你的角色习惯于隐藏感情。所以，给我们一瞥真相，然后迅速戴回面具。不要只是茫然地盯着！

​​演员B:​​ 那我的台词呢？"我发誓永不回来。" 我该喊出来吗？还是带着威胁低声说？

​​导演:​​ 抓住情绪！不要只触及表面。这是关键时刻。观众需要感受到你把握住了角色的绝望。

​​演员A:​​ 好吧，好吧。我试着更好地理解。没必要责骂我们。

​​导演:​​ 我不是在责骂！我是在督促你们变得更好！这出戏是生存还是灭亡，取决于你们今晚的表现。现在，再来一遍。谁去把镜子擦干净——我受不了看到我自己沮丧的倒影了！

== The Garden Dispute

​​Neighbor A:​​ Are you going to mow your lawn today? The grass is so long it's scattering seeds into my garden!

​​Neighbor B:​​ I'll get to it when I get to it. There's no need to glare at me like that. One glance at your perfect flower beds and I feel like I'm being preached at.

​​Neighbor A:​​ I'm not preaching! But we had an argument about this last week. You made a pledge to keep it tidy.

​​Neighbor B:​​ And I will! But you can't urge me to hurry and then curse me when I don't do it to your standard. I saw you peep over the fence yesterday and scoff!

​​Neighbor A:​​ I did not! I simply whistled to my dog. And I wasn't scoffing, I was... contemplating the weeds.

​​Neighbor B:​​ You were mocking me! You always do. You boast about your garden and then tease me about mine. Well, let me tell you something. I don't need you to snatch the shears from my hand. I can overtake your gardening skills any day! I just choose to loosen my grip on perfection!

​​Neighbor A:​​ (Sighs, then claps slowly) Bravo. What a performance. Fine. Do what you want. Just don't let your mess overtake the entire neighbourhood.

花园纠纷

​​邻居A:​​ 你今天打算修剪草坪吗？草长得太高了，种子都撒到我的花园里了！

​​邻居B:​​ 我有空自然会做。没必要那样怒视我。瞥一眼你完美的花坛，我就觉得你在说教我。

​​邻居A:​​ 我不是在说教！但我们上周为此争论过。你发誓会保持整洁的。

​​邻居B:​​ 我会的！但你不能一边催促我快点，一边因为不合你标准就咒骂我。我昨天看到你偷窥篱笆那边还嗤之以鼻！

​​邻居A:​​ 我没有！我只是在吹口哨叫我的狗。我也没嗤之以鼻，我是在……思考杂草的问题。

​​邻居B:​​ 你在嘲笑我！你总是这样。你吹嘘你的花园，然后嘲笑我的。好吧，我告诉你。我不需要你来抢我手里的剪刀。我随时都能超过你的园艺水平！我只是选择对完美不那么执着罢了！

​​邻居A:​​ (叹气，然后慢慢拍手) 好哇。演得真不错。行。随你便。只要你的烂摊子别蔓延到整个街区就行。

== The Art Restoration Project

​​Lead Conservator:​​ We need to carefully scrape away the old varnish without damaging the paint layer underneath. Then we can polish the surface to its original glory.

​​Apprentice:​​ It's amazing how these layers are bonded. The way the pigments combine with the oil... it's a marvel of chemistry.

​​Lead Conservator:​​ Indeed. But look at this area where the wood panel has split. We must insert a stabilizing agent before we can reconnect the pieces. It involves a very delicate process.

​​Apprentice:​​ I'm a bit nervous. What if I peel off something important? The responsibility is immense. It's almost terrifying.

​​Lead Conservator:​​ Don't panic. Just promise me you won't disregard the protocol. Follow each step. If we neglect a detail, it could lead to disaster. I'm not trying to bully you, just steering you right.

​​Apprentice:​​ I understand. It's just... this painting mesmerizes me. I'm completely obsessed with saving it. The irony of destroying it through my own ignorance would be an indignity I couldn't bear.

​​Lead Conservator:​​ That's a good attitude. A little healthy fear prevents carelessness. Now, let's arrange our tools and begin. The first contact with the surface is always the most thrilling.

艺术品修复项目

​​首席修复师:​​ 我们需要小心地刮掉旧清漆，不能损坏下面的颜料层。然后我们可以抛光表面，恢复其原有的光泽。

​​学徒:​​ 真神奇，这些层结合得如此牢固。颜料与油结合的方式……简直是化学的奇迹。

​​首席修复师:​​ 确实。但看看这块木板开裂的地方。我们必须先注入稳定剂，才能重新连接碎片。这个过程非常精细。

​​学徒:​​ 我有点紧张。万一我剥掉了重要的东西怎么办？责任重大。几乎令人恐惧。

​​首席修复师:​​ 别慌张。只要答应我不要无视操作规程。遵循每一步。如果我们疏忽了一个细节，可能导致灾难。我不是在欺负你，只是在正确引导你。

​​学徒:​​ 我明白。只是……这幅画让我着迷。我完全痴迷于拯救它。如果因为我的无知而毁掉它，这种讽刺将是我无法忍受的耻辱。

​​首席修复师:​​ 态度很好。一点健康的恐惧能防止粗心。现在，整理好我们的工具开始吧。第一次接触表面总是最激动人心的。

== The High-Stakes Negotiation

​​Negotiator:​​ We need to attract their interest, but not seem too eager. It's a fine line. We can't let them think we're obsessed with the deal.

​​Colleague:​​ I've arranged the initial contact. But their behavior bewilders me. They seem to disregard our main points. It's annoying, to say the least.

​​Negotiator:​​ It might be a tactic to upset us, to make us deviate from our plan. Don't fall for the bait. We have a promise to keep to our shareholders. The stakes are too high to gamble now.

​​Colleague:​​ I know. But the irony is, if we expel emotion completely, we might lose the human touch that makes the deal alluring. We need to combine firmness with flexibility.

​​Negotiator:​​ True. Their contempt for our initial offer is clear. But we can't flee the table. We must steer this towards a mutually beneficial bond. If they try to hijack the terms, we'll have to intervene.

​​Colleague:​​ It feels like a nightmare sometimes. The pressure is immense. But seeing it through to a successful integration would be amazing.

​​Negotiator:​​ That's the spirit. Let's not be terrified by their tactics. We have the upper hand. They need this as much as we do. Now, let's reconnect and tilt the balance in our favor.

高风险谈判

​​谈判专家:​​ 我们需要吸引他们的兴趣，但不能显得太急切。分寸很重要。不能让他们觉得我们痴迷于这笔交易。

​​同事:​​ 我已经安排了初步接触。但他们的行为让我困惑。他们似乎无视我们的主要观点。至少可以说，这很烦人。

​​谈判专家:​​ 这可能是扰乱我们、让我们偏离计划的策略。别上钩。我们对股东有承诺要遵守。赌注太高，现在不能冒险。

​​同事:​​ 我知道。但讽刺的是，如果我们完全排除情感，可能会失去使交易具有吸引力的亲和力。我们需要把坚定和灵活结合起来。

​​谈判专家:​​ 没错。他们对我们初始报价的蔑视是明显的。但我们不能逃离谈判桌。必须引导向互利共赢的结合。如果他们试图劫持条款，我们将不得不干预。

​​同事:​​ 有时感觉像一场噩梦。压力巨大。但坚持到成功整合将是惊人的。

​​谈判专家:​​ 就是这种精神。不要被他们的策略吓倒。我们占优势。他们和我们一样需要这笔交易。现在，让我们重新接触，扭转局面对我们有利。

== The Wharf Incident

​​Dockworker 1:​​ Did you see what happened? The crane's cable snapped, and the container began to sway violently. It collided with the ship's mast before it hit the water.

​​Dockworker 2:​​ I saw it! The whole thing was vibrating. I thought it would whirl right off the pier. It was terrifying. People started to panic and flee.

​​Dockworker 1:​​ It's a marvel no one was hurt. But the indignity of it... our safety protocols were completely neglected. This wasn't just an accident; it stems from a contempt for procedure.

​​Dockworker 2:​​ There's going to be an investigation. They'll want to know why the emergency brake failed to impede the fall. I bet someone will be expelled for this.

​​Dockworker 1:​​ Revenge isn't the answer. We need to integrate better safety measures, not just find a scapegoat. This should amaze everyone into action, not cause more fear.

​​Dockworker 2:​​ You're right. The bias towards speed over safety has to change. We can't deviate from the rules anymore. This was a close call.

码头事件

​​码头工人1:​​ 你看到发生了什么吗？起重机的电缆突然断裂，集装箱开始剧烈摇晃。它撞上了船的桅杆，然后才掉进水里。

​​码头工人2:​​ 我看到了！整个东西都在振动。我以为它会旋转着飞出码头。太可怕了。人们开始恐慌并逃跑。

​​码头工人1:​​ 没人受伤真是个奇迹。但这是耻辱……我们的安全规程被完全忽视了。这不仅仅是事故；它源于对程序的蔑视。

​​码头工人2:​​ 会有调查的。他们会想知道为什么紧急刹车没能阻止坠落。我打赌有人会因此被开除。

​​码头工人1:​​ 报复不是办法。我们需要整合更好的安全措施，而不是仅仅找替罪羊。这应该让每个人震惊并采取行动，而不是引起更多恐惧。

​​码头工人2:​​ 你说得对。重速度轻安全的偏见必须改变。我们再也不能偏离规则了。这次真是死里逃生。

'''

== The Psychological Thriller

​​Detective:​​ The kidnapper seems to mesmerize his victims. There's a pattern. He establishes contact, then inserts himself into their lives before he strikes. It's not a random act; it's meticulously arranged.

​​Psychologist:​​ He's manipulating their need for connection. He uses a false promise of belonging as bait. The victims become obsessed, unable to see the danger. It's a classic allure of the predator.

​​Detective:​​ The irony is chilling. They feel a bond, while he's planning to strangle them. The level of contempt for human life is astonishing.

​​Psychologist:​​ He likely feels immense indignity from a past neglect or betrayal. This is his revenge, twisted into a nightmare for others. He's expelling his own pain onto them.

​​Detective:​​ So how do we stop him? How do we impede his next move? He's already smuggled two victims across state lines. We can't allow a massacre.

​​Psychologist:​​ You need to understand his bias. He deviates from norms because he feels expelled from society. Don't bully your way in; you need to steer the investigation to understand his psychology. Otherwise, you'll just terrify him into hiding deeper.

​​Detective:​​ It's bewildering. But we have to try. The stakes are too high. We have a convict on our hands who thinks this is a game he can't lose.

心理惊悚案

​​侦探:​​ 绑架者似乎迷住了他的受害者。有规律可循。他先建立联系，然后介入他们的生活，最后才下手。不是随机行为；是精心安排的。

​​心理学家:​​ 他在操纵他们对联系的需求。他用虚假的归属承诺作为诱饵。受害者变得痴迷，看不到危险。这是捕食者的经典诱惑。

​​侦探:​​ 讽刺得令人心寒。他们感觉到一种联系，而他却在计划勒死他们。对生命的蔑视程度令人震惊。

​​心理学家:​​ 他可能因过去的忽视或背叛而感到巨大的耻辱。这是他的报复，扭曲成对他人的噩梦。他在把自己的痛苦驱逐到他们身上。

​​侦探:​​ 那我们怎么阻止他？如何阻碍他的下一步行动？他已经将两名受害者偷运过州界了。我们不能允许大屠杀发生。

​​心理学家:​​ 你需要理解他的偏见。他偏离常规是因为他觉得自己被社会驱逐了。不要强行介入；你需要引导调查去理解他的心理。否则，你只会吓到他，让他藏得更深。

​​侦探:​​ 真令人困惑。但我们必须尝试。赌注太高了。我们面对的是一个认为这是一场他不会输的游戏的定罪者。

== The Startup Pivot

​​CEO:​​ We need to pivot. Our initial approach has failed to attract users. We're being ignored, and it's annoying. We can't just scrape by anymore.

​​CTO:​​ I'm bewildered. The data doesn't support a full deviation. We've combined the best features. Why are we being disregarded?

​​Investor:​​ The market has a bias right now. It's not about the product; it's about the story. You need a promise that mesmerizes. Something that amazes people. You're involved in the tech, but you've neglected the allure.

​​CEO:​​ So what's the bait? How do we reconnect with our audience? This feels like a nightmare. I'm terrified we'll have to flee this market altogether.

​​CTO:​​ What if we integrate a social component? Create a bond between users? Something that doesn't just feel like a tool, but a community?

​​Investor:​​ Now you're steering in the right direction! That could be the marvel we need. But don't manipulate the users. Authenticity is key. A false promise will expel them faster than you can attract them.

​​CEO:​​ Okay. Let's arrange a new launch. We'll wrap the new features in a narrative of connection. This is a gamble, but the stakes are too high not to bet on ourselves.

初创公司转型

​​首席执行官:​​ 我们需要转向。我们最初的方法未能吸引用户。我们被忽视了，这很烦人。我们不能只是勉强维持了。

​​首席技术官:​​ 我很困惑。数据并不支持完全偏离。我们结合了最好的功能。为什么我们被无视了？

​​投资者:​​ 市场目前有偏见。问题不在产品，而在故事。你需要一个令人着迷的承诺。让人惊叹的东西。你们埋头于技术，但忽略了吸引力。

​​首席执行官:​​ 那诱饵是什么？如何与我们的受众重新建立联系？这感觉像一场噩梦。我害怕我们将不得不完全逃离这个市场。

​​首席技术官:​​ 如果我们整合一个社交组件呢？在用户之间建立联系？不只是工具，而是一个社区？

​​投资者:​​ 现在你引导到正确方向了！那可能是我们需要的奇迹。但不要操纵用户。真实性是关键。虚假的承诺驱逐用户的速度会比吸引他们更快。

​​首席执行官:​​ 好吧。让我们安排一次新的发布。我们将把新功能包装成一个关于联系的故事。这是一场赌博，但赌注太高，不能不赌自己赢。

== The Factory Floor Investigation

​​Safety Inspector:​​ The report says the worker's sleeve was caught in the rotating machinery. It pulled him in before he could shake himself free.

​​Foreman:​​ It was horrible. The machine began to reel him in. He was dragged, his feet shuffling, unable to get traction. It's a miracle he wasn't decimated.

​​Safety Inspector:​​ How did it happen? Was there a failure to follow the safety trail? These machines are supposed to have sensors that impede contact.

​​Foreman:​​ We think he was trying to clear a jam. He might have used a tool to penetrate the guard. The metal pierced the safety shield. It's a clear contempt for protocol.

​​Safety Inspector:​​ This neglect astonishes me. You can't just baptise a new procedure without proper training! It's not a gamble you can take with people's lives. The indignity of a preventable accident...

​​Foreman:​​ I know. The whole event has left us all shaken. We need to rotate the safety talks more frequently. We can't let this happen again. We'll tow the damaged unit away today and arrange a full investigation.

工厂车间调查

​​安全巡检员:​​ 报告说工人的袖子被卷入了旋转的机器里。在他能挣脱之前就被拉进去了。

​​工头:​​ 太可怕了。机器开始把他卷进去。他被拖着走，脚在地上拖着，无法着力。他没被撕碎真是奇迹。

​​安全巡检员:​​ 怎么发生的？是没有遵循安全规程吗？这些机器应该有传感器阻止接触。

​​工头:​​ 我们认为他当时在试图清理堵塞。他可能用了工具穿透了防护罩。金属刺穿了安全盾。这是对规程的明显蔑视。

​​安全巡检员:​​ 这种疏忽让我震惊。不能没有适当培训就启用新程序！这不是拿人命可以赌博的事情。可预防事故的耻辱……

​​工头:​​ 我知道。整个事件让我们所有人都感到震惊。我们需要更频繁地轮换安全会议。不能让这种事再次发生。我们今天会把损坏的单元拖走，并安排全面调查。

== The Project Kickoff Meeting

​​Project Manager:​​ Alright team, we're about to commence a major new project. I'll assign each of you a specific role. We need to distribute the workload effectively.

​​Lead Engineer:​​ I'll undertake the technical design. But we must stipulate clear boundaries to avoid scope creep. We can't attempt to do everything at once.

​​Marketing Lead:​​ I aspire to launch this product with a major campaign. We need to exert maximum effort to gain market share. We should explore all possible channels.

​​Project Manager:​​ Excellent. But let's be realistic. We need to cope with potential setbacks. If we encounter problems, we have a backup plan. Our conduct throughout will be professional. We cannot omit any risks from our plan.

​​Lead Engineer:​​ Understood. I'm convinced we can tackle the technical challenges. I yearn to see this product succeed; it's a desire I've had for years.

​​Marketing Lead:​​ Same here. I wish we could just fast-forward to the launch! But we have to strive for perfection. We need to render a product that will magnify our company's reputation.

​​Project Manager:​​ That's the spirit. Let's not exaggerate the challenges, but let's not conceal them either. Our goal is to fulfil the client's needs and augment our own capabilities. Now, let's get to work.

项目启动会议

​​项目经理:​​ 好了，团队，我们即将开始一个重大的新项目。我将为你们每个人分配具体的角色。我们需要有效地分配工作量。

​​首席工程师:​​ 我将承担技术设计工作。但我们必须规定明确的界限，以避免范围蔓延。我们不能试图一次性完成所有事情。

​​市场负责人:​​ 我渴望通过一场大型活动来推出这个产品。我们需要付出最大努力来获取市场份额。我们应该探索所有可能的渠道。

​​项目经理:​​ 很好。但我们要现实一点。我们需要应对潜在的挫折。如果遇到问题，我们有一个备用计划。我们整个过程的行为都要专业。我们不能忽略计划中的任何风险。

​​首席工程师:​​ 明白。我相信我们能够应对技术挑战。我渴望看到这个产品成功；这是我一直以来的愿望。

​​市场负责人:​​ 我也是。我真希望我们能快进到发布日！但我们必须力求完美。我们需要交付一个能够提升我们公司声誉的产品。

​​项目经理:​​ 就是这种精神。我们不要夸大挑战，但也不要隐瞒它们。我们的目标是满足客户的需求，并增强我们自身的能力。现在，开始工作吧。

== The Rescue Operation Debrief

​​Rescue Commander:​​ We had to launch the operation at dawn. The situation was dire, and we had to resort to using helicopters to reach the stranded hikers.

​​Field Medic:​​ Our main goal was to recover all individuals safely. We couldn't omit anyone. The team exerted tremendous effort to propel themselves up the steep terrain.

​​Logistics Officer:​​ I had to arrange supplies and ensure we had backup equipment. We had to replenish our medical kits on the fly. It was a challenge to obtain clear communication in the mountains.

​​Rescue Commander:​​ You all did an amazing job. You managed to restore order in a chaotic situation. We had to reverse our initial plan due to the weather, but you adapted.

​​Field Medic:​​ There was a moment when I had to erase my own fear to reassure a terrified hiker. I assured him we would not cancel the mission. We were there to rescue them.

​​Logistics Officer:​​ We had to dispose of some damaged gear, but we recovered most of it. The whole experience will help us rectify our procedures for future missions. It offset the difficulties we faced.

​​Rescue Commander:​​ Absolutely. This operation will uphold our reputation. The teamwork I witnessed today was incredible. It was a true desire to help that propelled you all.

救援行动汇报

​​救援指挥官:​​ 我们不得不在黎明时分展开行动。情况很严峻，我们不得不动用直升机来接近被困的徒步旅行者。

​​现场医护人员:​​ 我们的主要目标是安全找回所有人。我们不能遗漏任何人。团队付出了巨大的努力，在陡峭的地形上艰难前行。

​​后勤官:​​ 我必须安排物资供应，确保我们有备用设备。我们必须在行进中补充医疗用品。在山里获得清晰的通信是一个挑战。

​​救援指挥官:​​ 你们都做得非常出色。你们在混乱的情况下恢复了秩序。由于天气原因，我们不得不改变最初的计划，但你们适应了。

​​现场医护人员:​​ 有那么一刻，我必须消除自己的恐惧，去安抚一个受惊的徒步旅行者。我向他保证我们不会取消任务。我们是来救他们的。

​​后勤官:​​ 我们不得不处理掉一些损坏的装备，但大部分都找回来了。整个经历将有助于我们修正未来任务的程序。这弥补了我们所面临的困难。

​​救援指挥官:​​ 当然。这次行动将维护我们的声誉。今天我目睹的团队合作是不可思议的。是真正的助人愿望推动着你们所有人。

== The Negotiation Table

​​Negotiator A:​​ We need to convince them to accept our offer. We can't just wish for the best; we need a strategy to induce them to sign.

​​Negotiator B:​​ I agree. But we must be careful not to exaggerate our capabilities. We should offer a deal that will augment their current position, not make false promises.

​​Negotiator A:​​ True. Let's not attempt to conceal any potential drawbacks. Full transparency will help reassure them. We want to gain their trust, not tempt them into a bad deal.

​​Negotiator B:​​ So, what's our range? What can we realistically render? We need to sort out our priorities before we commence the talks.

​​Negotiator A:​​ Our primary desire is a long-term partnership. We're willing to undertake a certain level of risk to obtain that. We can offset some of their initial costs.

​​Negotiator B:​​ Good. And if they refuse? We need a backup plan. We might have to exclude some of the more ambitious clauses.

​​Negotiator A:​​ Let's hope it doesn't come to that. I'm striving for a win-win outcome. This deal could propel our company into a new league.

​​谈判代表A:​​ 我们需要说服他们接受我们的报价。不能只是期望最好的结果；我们需要一个策略来促使他们签字。

​​谈判代表B:​​ 我同意。但我们必须小心，不要夸大我们的能力。我们应该提供一份能增强他们当前地位的协议，而不是做出虚假承诺。

​​谈判代表A:​​ 没错。我们不要试图隐瞒任何潜在的缺点。完全透明将有助于让他们放心。我们想赢得他们的信任，而不是诱惑他们达成一笔糟糕的交易。

​​谈判代表B:​​ 那么，我们的范围是多少？我们实际能提供什么？在开始谈判之前，我们需要理清优先事项。

​​谈判代表A:​​ 我们的首要愿望是建立长期伙伴关系。为了获得这个，我们愿意承担一定风险。我们可以抵消他们的一些初始成本。

​​谈判代表B:​​ 好的。如果他们拒绝呢？我们需要一个备用计划。我们可能不得不排除一些更雄心勃勃的条款。

​​谈判代表A:​​ 希望不会到那一步。我正在努力争取一个双赢的结果。这笔交易可能将我们的公司推向一个新的高度。

== The Software Development Crisis

​​Tech Lead:​​ We have a major bug in the system. It's causing data to be deleted at random. We need to reverse the last deployment immediately.

​​Developer A:​​ I'll attempt to isolate the issue. But we might have to cancel the upcoming release. We can't supply a faulty product to our clients.

​​Developer B:​​ I'm striving to recover the lost data from backups. But it's a slow process. We need to exert more effort to rectify this quickly.

​​Tech Lead:​​ Everyone, stay calm. We can cope with this. We have a backup plan. Let's not omit any steps in our debugging process. We need to conduct a thorough investigation.

​​Developer A:​​ The pressure is really starting to loom large. I wish we had more time. This sort of crisis is what I aspire to be able to handle better.

​​Tech Lead:​​ I assure you, we will get through this. We need to dispose of the faulty code and restore stability. Our reputation is at stake here. We must uphold our commitment to quality.

​​Developer B:​​ Understood. I'm convinced we can tackle this. Let's launch our diagnostic tools and commence the recovery process. We will recover from this setback.

软件开发危机

​​技术主管:​​ 系统出现了一个重大漏洞。它导致数据被随机删除。我们需要立即撤销上一次的部署。

​​开发人员A:​​ 我会尝试隔离问题。但我们可能不得不取消即将发布的版本。我们不能向客户提供有缺陷的产品。

​​开发人员B:​​ 我正在努力从备份中恢复丢失的数据。但这个过程很慢。我们需要付出更多努力来迅速纠正这个问题。

​​技术主管:​​ 各位，保持冷静。我们能应对这种情况。我们有一个备用计划。在调试过程中不要遗漏任何步骤。我们需要进行彻底的调查。

​​开发人员A:​​ 压力真的开始变得很大了。真希望我们有更多时间。我渴望能更好地处理这类危机。

​​技术主管:​​ 我向你们保证，我们会渡过难关的。我们需要处理掉有问题的代码并恢复稳定性。我们的声誉岌�可危。我们必须坚持对质量的承诺。

​​开发人员B:​​ 明白。我相信我们能解决这个问题。启动我们的诊断工具，开始恢复过程吧。我们会从这次挫折中恢复过来的。

== The Personal Goal Setting

​​Friend A:​​ I really yearn to start my own business. It's an itch I've had for years. I'm going to attempt it next year.

​​Friend B:​​ That's a great aspiration! But have you thought about the effort required? You'll need to undertake a lot of work. What sort of business do you wish to launch?

​​Friend A:​​ I'm exploring a few ideas. I want to offer a service that will augment people's lives. I have a strong desire to fulfil this dream.

​​Friend B:​​ I'm convinced you can do it. But let me reassure you, it's okay to start small. You don't need to magnify the plan too much at the beginning. Just strive to get it off the ground.

​​Friend A:​​ Thanks. I know I'll need to gain a lot of knowledge. I might even have to reverse some decisions along the way. But I'm prepared to exert the energy.

​​Friend B:​​ That's the spirit! And remember, I'm here to backup you up. If you need to replenish your motivation, just call me. I'll help propel you forward!

个人目标设定

​​朋友A:​​ 我真的很渴望开创自己的事业。这是多年来一直有的念头。我打算明年尝试一下。

​​朋友B:​​ 这是个伟大的抱负！但你考虑过需要付出的努力吗？你需要承担大量的工作。你希望创办什么样的企业？

​​朋友A:​​ 我正在探索几个想法。我想提供一种能够改善人们生活的服务。我强烈渴望实现这个梦想。

​​朋友B:​​ 我相信你能做到。但让我告诉你，从小处着手是可以的。一开始不需要把计划搞得太宏大。只需努力让它启动起来。

​​朋友A:​​ 谢谢。我知道我需要获取很多知识。一路上甚至可能不得不改变一些决定。但我准备好了付出精力。

​​朋友B:​​ 就是这种精神！记住，我在这里支持你。如果你需要重拾动力，打电话给我。我会帮助你前进的！

== The Covert Mission Briefing

​​Commander:​​ We need to despatch a small, detached team for this mission. I will designate Agent Jones as the team leader.

​​Agent Smith:​​ Understood. Our objective is to exploit a weakness in their security system. We cannot afford to prolong the operation; it must be swift.

​​Commander:​​ Correct. You'll need to disguise your identities. Use the cover we've provided. Your primary task is to recover the data, then erase any trace of your presence. If you're discovered, do not attempt to engage. Your orders are to undo any compromised systems and retreat immediately.

​​Agent Jones:​​ What if we invoke the backup protocol? That would amplify the signal, but it might also alert their patrols.

​​Commander:​​ Only as a last resort to redeem a failing situation. The goal is to enlarge our understanding of their network, not to provoke a confrontation. Use the equipment to amplify the signal only if absolutely necessary. We need to obtain that intelligence without being detected.

​​Agent Smith:​​ We'll do our best to remain concealed. We won't let you down. We know what's at stake.

秘密任务简报

​​指挥官:​​ 我们需要派遣一支独立的小队执行此任务。我将指定琼斯特工为队长。

​​史密斯特工:​​ 明白。我们的目标是利用他们安全系统的弱点。行动不能拖延；必须迅速。

​​指挥官:​​ 正确。你们需要伪装身份。使用我们提供的掩护。主要任务是恢复数据，然后抹去所有痕迹。如果暴露，不要试图交火。命令是撤销任何被入侵的系统并立即撤退。

​​琼斯特工:​​ 如果我们启用备用协议呢？那会放大信号，但也可能惊动他们的巡逻队。

​​指挥官:​​ 只在为挽救失败局面时作为最后手段。目标是扩大我们对其网络的了解，而非引发冲突。仅在绝对必要时使用设备放大信号。我们需要在未被发现的情况下获取情报。

​​史密斯特工:​​ 我们会尽力隐藏。不会让您失望。我们知道利害关系。

'''

== The Data Center Crisis

​​Tech Lead:​​ We need to update our emergency protocol immediately. We have a critical leak in the cooling system; water is seeping into the server racks.

​​Engineer:​​ It's not just seeping, it's starting to ooze out. The floor is saturated. We must evacuate the non-essential staff and contain the spill before it triggers a full outage.

​​Tech Lead:​​ I don't recall seeing this in the maintenance retrospect. How did we miss this? We need to retrieve the blueprints to distinguish the main water line from the power conduits.

​​Engineer:​​ I'll seek the physical plans. But we need a purpose-built solution, not a temporary substitute. This problem overshadows everything else. We can't just muffle the alarms; we need to fix the cause.

​​Tech Lead:​​ You're right. Our primary objective is to preserve the data. Let's welcome any ideas. We need to celebrate small victories here. If we can surmount this, we deserve a bonus.

​​Engineer:​​ I'm inclined to side with a full shutdown. We should lean on the side of caution. It's a tough farewell to our uptime streak, but it's for the sake of the company's future.

​​Tech Lead:​​ Okay. Let's implement the accord we have for a Level 3 incident. I'll greet the fire department and impart the situation. You focus on the technical retrieval. Let's go.

数据中心危机

​​技术主管:​​ 我们需要立即更新紧急协议。冷却系统有严重泄漏；水正渗入服务器机架。

​​工程师:​​ 不只是渗入，开始渗出来了。地板都湿透了。必须疏散非必要员工，在泄漏引发全面故障前控制住。

​​技术主管:​​ 我不记得在维护回顾中看到过这点。怎么漏掉的？需要检索蓝图，区分主管道和电力管线。

​​工程师:​​ 我去找实体图纸。但需要专门的解决方案，不是临时替代品。这问题使其他事都相形见绌。不能只掩盖警报；必须修复根源。

​​技术主管:​​ 对。首要目标是保存数据。欢迎任何想法。需要庆祝小胜利。若能克服此事，我们该得奖金。

​​工程师:​​ 我倾向于完全关机。应倾向于谨慎一方。告别连续运行记录很可惜，但为了公司未来。

​​工程师:​​ 好。执行三级事故协议。我去迎接消防部门并说明情况。你专注技术恢复。行动。

'''

== The Courtroom Testimony

​​Lawyer:​​ Please recall the events of that night for the court. What did you see that caused you to testify today?

​​Witness:​​ I recollect it clearly. I was leaning against my car when I heard a muffled sound. Then I saw a man plummet from the fire escape. It was not an accident; it was meant to look like one.

​​Lawyer:​​ Can you distinguish the individual you saw? Can you specify any attributes?

​​Witness:​​ I can. He had a distinct sideways gait. But what impressed me most was the cold regard in his eyes. He didn't seek to help; he just dropped something and walked away.

​​Lawyer:​​ Your Honor, this testimony corresponds with the evidence we will present. It should arouse the jury's suspicion about the defendant's story. We seek to verify the truth.

​​Judge:​​ I will allow it. Proceed. But please, let's not retell the story repeatedly. We need new information.

​​Defense Lawyer:​​ Objection! This is an attempt to mortify my client with vague recollections! There is no cause to attribute this to him without proof!

​​Prosecutor:​​ The proof is coming, Your Honor. The truth has a way of pervading the darkness. We will welcome it when it arrives.

法庭证词

​​律师:​​ 请向法庭回忆那晚的事。你看到了什么，导致你今天出庭作证？

​​证人:​​ 我记得很清楚。我正靠着车，听到闷响。然后看到一人从消防梯坠落。不是意外；是伪装的。

​​律师:​​ 能区分你看到的人吗？能明确任何特征吗？

​​证人:​​ 能。他有独特的侧身步态。但最让我印象深刻的是他眼中冷漠的神情。他没试图帮忙；扔下东西就走了。

​​律师:​​ 法官大人，该证词与我们提交的证据一致。应能引起陪审团对被告陈述的怀疑。我们寻求核实真相。

​​法官:​​ 允许。继续。但请勿重复叙述。需要新信息。

​​辩护律师:​​ 反对！这是用模糊记忆羞辱我的当事人！无证据不得归因于他！

​​检察官:​​ 证据即将呈现，法官大人。真相总会弥漫黑暗。我们欢迎其到来。

== The Art Gallery Opening

​​Curator:​​ We gather to celebrate the work of an artist who seeks to enlighten us. Her work imparts a sense of peace that pervades this room.

​​Art Critic:​​ I must say, this collection truly impresses me. It makes me recall my travels to Greece. The way she uses light… it’s like a blessing.

​​Visitor:​​ I feel the same. It has a way of triggering deep emotions. It makes me lean into the feeling, not sideways away from it. It’s like she’s inviting us to participate in her vision.

​​Curator:​​ That was her purpose. She wanted to create something that would distinguish her, but also correspond to a universal human experience. She used to say, "For the sake of art, we must sometimes drop our preconceptions."

​​Art Critic:​​ She certainly achieved her objective. This piece here, it overshadows everything else in the show. It’s a worthy substitute for the masterpiece we lost.

​​Visitor:​​ It’s a fitting farewell to her career. I regard her as a true master. We should salute her.

​​Curator:​​ Let’s raise our glasses. To the artist! May her work continue to arouse passion and wonder.

画廊开幕

​​策展人:​​ 我们齐聚庆祝一位致力于启迪我们的艺术家。她的作品赋予本室一种弥漫的宁静感。

​​评论家:​​ 不得不说，这系列真令我印象深刻。让我回忆起希腊之旅。她用光的方式……宛如一种祝福。

​​访客:​​ 同感。它能触发深层情感。让我倾心投入，而非侧身回避。像在邀请我们参与其愿景。

​​策展人:​​ 这正是其目的。她想创造既能区分自己，又契合普世人类体验的作品。她常说："为艺术故，有时须摒弃成见。"

​​评论家:​​ 她无疑达成了目标。这幅作品使展中他物相形见绌。是遗失杰作的 worthy substitute。

​​访客:​​ 是对她职业生涯的恰切告别。我视她为真正大师。应向她致敬。

​​策展人:​​ 举杯吧。敬艺术家！愿其作品持续激发热情与惊奇。

'''

== The Team Retrospective

​​Project Manager:​​ Okay team, let's retrospect on the last sprint. What's the update? Did we achieve our objective?

​​Developer A:​​ I think we made good progress. But we need to raise a concern: the constant context switches. It causes a lot of mental overhead. It's like trying to fix a leak while water is still seeping in.

​​Developer B:​​ I agree. I seek more focus time. Yesterday, I had to drop a task to contain a bug that was about to saturate the system. It overshadows the new feature work.

​​Project Manager:​​ I regard that as a valid point. For the sake of productivity, we should try to muffle some of the external noise. But we must also welcome feedback; it helps us improve.

​​Developer A:​​ True. And I don't want to mortify anyone, but we need to distinguish between urgent and important. We're too inclined to jump on every alert.

​​Developer B:​​ Let me retell what the client said: they were impressed with our last delivery. But they specified that stability is key. We need to attribute more resources to testing.

​​Project Manager:​​ Noted. I recall that accord. Let's update the plan accordingly. I forgive the delays if we can surmount this stability challenge. You all deserve recognition for your hard work.

团队复盘会

​​项目经理:​​ 好的团队，回顾一下上个冲刺。有什么更新？达成目标了吗？

​​开发员A:​​ 我认为进展良好。但需提出关切：持续的情境切换。导致很多精神开销。像边堵漏边渗水。

​​开发员B:​​ 同意。我寻求更多专注时间。昨天不得不放下任务去遏制一个快淹没系统的漏洞。这使新功能工作相形见绌。

​​项目经理:​​ 我认为这是合理的点。为效率故，应尝试屏蔽部分外部噪音。但也须欢迎反馈；它助我们改进。

​​开发员A:​​ 对。不想羞辱谁，但需区分紧急与重要。我们太倾向于响应每个警报。

​​开发员B:​​ 我复述客户的话：他们对上次交付印象深刻。但明确稳定性是关键。需分配更多资源给测试。

​​项目经理:​​ 收到。我记得那协议。据此更新计划。若克服此稳定性挑战，延迟可谅解。你们的辛勤值得认可。

'''

== The Personal Intervention

​​Friend A:​​ We're here today for your sake. We regard you as a brother, and we need to raise some concerns. Your drinking is starting to overshadow everything else.

​​Friend B:​​ What are you talking about? I can drop it anytime. You don't need to greet me with an intervention.

​​Friend C:​​ It's not an attack. We welcome you to participate in this conversation. But we've seen you plummet lately. The excuses are starting to saturate your life.

​​Friend B:​​ So you seek to enlighten me? To impart your wisdom? I don't deserve this.

​​Friend A:​​ It's because we care. We recall the person you were. The one who could surmount any challenge. That person is worth fighting for. This behavior doesn't distinguish you; it's replacing the real you with a substitute.

​​Friend C:​​ We're not here to mortify you. We're here to trigger a change. For the sake of your future, lean on us. Let us help you contain this before it causes irreparable damage.

​​Friend B:​​ (Sighs) It's hard to hear. But... I suppose I invited this by my actions. Thank you for not giving up on me. I forgive your bluntness.

亲友干预

​​朋友A:​​ 今天为此聚首是为你。我们视你如兄弟，需提出一些关切。你的饮酒问题开始掩盖一切。

​​朋友B:​​ 说什么？我随时可戒。不必以干预迎接我。

​​朋友C:​​ 非攻击。欢迎你参与对话。但我们见你近日坠落。借口开始浸透你的生活。

​​朋友B:​​ 所以你们要启迪我？传授智慧？我不配。

​​朋友A:​​ 因我们在乎。我们记得曾经的你。那个能克服任何挑战的人。那人值得争取。此行为不能区分你；它在用替代品取代真实的你。

​​朋友C:​​ 非为羞辱。为引发改变。为你未来故，依靠我们。让我们助你在造成不可逆损害前控制住。

​​朋友B:​​ (叹气) 难听。但……想是我行为招致此果。谢谢不放弃我。原谅你们的直率。

== The Hardware Store Dilemma

​​Customer:​​ I need to replace my kitchen sink. The old one has a leak I can't contain. Water is starting to seep underneath.

​​Store Clerk:​​ I can assist with that. We have an assortment to choose from. But first, let me remind you: you'll need to differentiate between a drop-in sink and an undermount sink. The installation is different.

​​Customer:​​ I'm not inclined to do it myself. I'll hire a plumber. I just need something that won't sink through the countertop!

​​Store Clerk:​​ (Chuckles) Fair enough. This model here is very popular. It's a bit flattering to the overall look of the kitchen, if I may say so. Easy to clean, too.

​​Customer:​​ I don't need flattery, just function. But I suppose a nice look doesn't hurt. My wife seems to worship this brand, so that might sway me.

​​Store Clerk:​​ Well, let me not try to worship the product too much. Its attributes speak for themselves. Once it's installed, I congratulate you in advance on the upgrade!

​​Customer:​​ Thanks. I just hope it doesn't cause more problems. Last time, the plumber left a trench in my wall that I had to fix.

​​Store Clerk:​​ We work with certified professionals. They'll treat your home with regard. No trenches, I assure you!

五金店困境

​​顾客:​​ 我需要更换厨房水槽。旧的有个堵不住的漏洞。水开始渗到下面了。

​​店员:​​ 我可以帮忙。我们有很多种类可选。但首先提醒您：需区分台上盆和台下盆。安装方式不同。

​​顾客:​​ 我不想自己装。会雇水管工。我只需要不会掉进台面的东西！

​​店员:​​ (笑) 有道理。这款很受欢迎。容我奉承一句，它很能衬托厨房整体外观。也易清洁。

​​顾客:​​ 不需要奉承，只要功能。但好看当然不坏。我妻子似乎崇拜这品牌，所以可能说服我。

​​店员:​​ 好吧，我不多夸产品了。其特性不言而喻。装好后，提前祝贺您升级成功！

​​顾客:​​ 谢谢。只希望别导致更多问题。上次水管工在墙上留了条沟要我修补。

​​店员:​​ 我们与认证专业人士合作。他们会尊重您的家。保证不留沟！
