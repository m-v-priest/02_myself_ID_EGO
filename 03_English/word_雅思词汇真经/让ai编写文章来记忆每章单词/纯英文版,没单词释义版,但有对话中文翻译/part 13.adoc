== The Architectural Firm Meeting

​​Architect A:​​ The design for the new city library is ambitious. We're thinking of a concrete and steel structure.

​​Architect B:​​ I agree. But we must ensure its stability. The site is near a river. We can't obstruct the water flow.

​​Architect A:​​ True. The foundation is key. We need to build it to last. It should become a landmark.

​​Architect B:​​ Exactly. The interior layout needs to be spacious. Maybe a large central void with an escalator?

​​Architect A:​​ Good idea. The exterior should be striking too. A modern design with lots of glass. It will be situated in a prime urban location.

​​Architect B:​​ People will migrate to this area just to see it. It's more than a building; it's a statement.

建筑公司会议

​​建筑师A:​​ 新城市图书馆的设计很有野心。我们考虑采用混凝土和钢结构。

​​建筑师B:​​ 我同意。但我们必须确保其稳定性。地点靠近河流。我们不能阻碍水流。

​​建筑师A:​​ 没错。地基是关键。我们要把它建得持久。它应该成为一个地标。

​​建筑师B:​​ 正是。内部布局需要宽敞。也许一个带自动扶梯的大型中央中庭？

​​建筑师A:​​ 好主意。外观也应该引人注目。现代设计，大量使用玻璃。它将坐落在一个优越的城市位置。

​​建筑师B:​​ 人们会蜂拥到这个地区来参观它。这不仅仅是一座建筑；它是一种宣言。

'''

== The Downtown Apartment Hunt

​​Friend A:​​ I'm looking for a new apartment downtown. Something with an inner courtyard, maybe.

​​Friend B:​​ Good luck! Most flats in this vicinity are tiny. And the exterior of these buildings is often neglected.

​​Friend A:​​ I know. But I found one! A spacious flat on the top storey. It has a living room with high ceilings and a balcony.

​​Friend B:​​ A balcony? In the city? That's rare. Is there an elevator? I'm not climbing ten flights of stairs!

​​Friend A:​​ (Laughs) Yes, there's an elevator. And a lobby with a reception area. It's part of a new complex.

​​Friend B:​​ Sounds nice. What about the kitchen? And the lavatory?

​​Friend A:​​ The kitchen is modern. The lavatory has a new bath and basin. It's all recently furnished.

​​Friend B:​​ I'm jealous! When can I visit? I'll bring a housewarming gift for your new dwelling!

市中心找公寓

​​朋友A:​​ 我在市中心找新公寓。最好带内院的。

​​朋友B:​​ 祝你好运！这附近的公寓大多很小。而且这些建筑的外观经常被忽略。

​​朋友A:​​ 我知道。但我找到了一个！顶层的宽敞公寓。客厅有高天花板和阳台。

​​朋友B:​​ 阳台？在城里？真罕见。有电梯吗？我可不想爬十层楼梯！

​​朋友A:​​ (笑) 有电梯。还有带接待区的大堂。是一个新综合楼的一部分。

​​朋友B:​​ 听起来不错。厨房呢？卫生间呢？

​​朋友A:​​ 厨房很现代。卫生间有新浴缸和面盆。都是新装修的。

​​朋友B:​​ 我嫉妒了！我什么时候能去看看？我给你新居带件暖房礼物！

== The Countryside Cottage Renovation

​​Homeowner:​​ This old cottage needs a lot of work. The exterior is fine, but the interior is a mess.

​​Carpenter:​​ I can see that. The beams need reinforcing. And we should install a new staircase.

​​Homeowner:​​ Yes. I want to maintain its charm though. Maybe add a porch? And fix the chimney.

​​Carpenter:​​ Of course. We can use traditional brickwork. I'll need my tools: a saw, a drill, screws... the whole apparatus.

​​Homeowner:​​ Great. There's also a small shed in the garden. It has a hook for tools. Can you mend the roof?

​​Carpenter:​​ No problem. I'll assemble some new planks. I might need to weld a bracket for the lever on the old well too.

​​Homeowner:​​ Wonderful. I want this to be a peaceful dwelling. A place to escape the urban noise.

​​Carpenter:​​ It will be. Once we're done, you can sit by the fireplace and enjoy the quiet.

乡村小屋翻新

​​房主:​​ 这间老小屋需要大修。外观还行，但内部一团糟。

​​木匠:​​ 我看出来了。梁需要加固。我们还应该安装一个新楼梯。

​​房主:​​ 是的。但我想保持它的魅力。也许加个门廊？修一下烟囱。

​​木匠:​​ 当然。我们可以用传统的砖砌工艺。我需要我的工具：锯子、电钻、螺丝……全套设备。

​​房主:​​ 太好了。花园里还有个小棚屋。有个工具钩。能修一下屋顶吗？

​​木匠:​​ 没问题。我会组装一些新木板。可能还需要给旧井的杠杆焊个支架。

​​房主:​​ 好极了。我希望这里是个安静的居所。一个逃离城市喧嚣的地方。

​​木匠:​​ 会的。等我们完工，你可以坐在壁炉边享受宁静。

'''

== The Shopping Mall Mishap

​​Shopper A:​​ This mall is huge! I'm lost. Is there a layout map near the entrance?

​​Shopper B:​​ I think so, by the escalator. Let's check. I need to find a store that sells tools. A saw or a drill.

​​Shopper A:​​ Okay. Oh no! The elevator seems to have a malfunction. It's stuck. People can't exit.

​​Shopper B:​​ That's not good. Good thing we're using the stairs. Look, there's a maintenance worker. He has a toolbox to fix it.

​​Shopper A:​​ I hope he can mend it quickly. This is the busiest venue in the downtown area on a weekend.

​​Shopper B:​​ True. Let's go to the supermarket on the lower level. Then we can exit through the outside doors on that side.

​​Shopper A:​​ Good plan. I don't want to be stuck inside this concrete block all day!

购物中心小插曲

​​顾客A:​​ 这商场真大！我迷路了。入口附近有布局图吗？

​​顾客B:​​ 我想有，在自动扶梯旁边。去看看。我要找卖工具的店。锯子或电钻。

​​顾客A:​​ 好的。哦不！电梯好像出故障了。卡住了。人们出不来。

​​顾客B:​​ 真糟糕。幸好我们走楼梯。看，有个维修工。他有工具箱可以修理。

​​顾客A:​​ 希望他能快点修好。这是周末市中心最繁忙的地方了。

​​顾客B:​​ 没错。我们去底层的超市吧。然后我们可以从那边的外门出去。

​​顾客A:​​ 好计划。我可不想一整天被困在这个混凝土方块里！

'''

== The Construction Site Tour

​​Engineer:​​ Welcome to the construction site. The erection of the main pillar is complete. Next, we assemble the steel beams.

​​Visitor:​​ Impressive. What's that large machine?

​​Engineer:​​ That's the crane. It lifts the heavy materials. We also use a scaffold for the workers to access higher levels.

​​Visitor:​​ I see. And what about the infrastructure? Water, electricity?

​​Engineer:​​ That's all being installed underground. The internal plumbing is a complex job. We need to get it right.

​​Visitor:​​ It's amazing how you build from the ground up. This will be a great addition to the urban landscape.

​​Engineer:​​ We hope so. Safety is our priority. Everyone must wear a hard hat and stay clear of the work area.

建筑工地参观

​​工程师:​​ 欢迎来到建筑工地。主柱的竖立已完成。接下来是组装钢梁。

​​访客:​​ 令人印象深刻。那个大机器是什么？

​​工程师:​​ 是起重机。用来吊装重物。我们还用脚手架让工人到达更高层。

​​访客:​​ 明白了。基础设施呢？水、电？

​​工程师:​​ 都在地下安装。内部管道是项复杂的工作。我们必须做好。

​​访客:​​ 从零开始建设真了不起。这将是城市景观的一大补充。

​​工程师:​​ 希望如此。安全是我们的首要任务。每个人都必须戴安全帽，远离工作区。

'''

== The Art Gallery Opening

​​Guest A:​​ This new gallery is a fantastic structure. The use of space is brilliant. So spacious.

​​Guest B:​​ I agree. The entrance is very dramatic. And the main room has a high vaulted ceiling. It's a great venue for modern art.

​​Guest A:​​ Definitely. The layout leads you naturally through the exhibits. I like how they use the columns to create separate areas.

​​Guest B:​​ Yes, it's a clever design. It feels open but also intimate. Let's go out to the terrace. They have sculptures placed outside.

​​Guest A:​​ Good idea. The exterior space is just as important as the interior here. It's a perfect urban oasis.

美术馆开幕

​​嘉宾A:​​ 这个新美术馆的结构很棒。空间利用很出色。很宽敞。

​​嘉宾B:​​ 我同意。入口很有戏剧性。主厅有高高的拱形天花板。是展示现代艺术的好场地。

​​嘉宾A:​​ 当然。布局自然地引导你参观展品。我喜欢他们用柱子分隔区域的方式。

​​嘉宾B:​​ 是的，设计很巧妙。感觉开放又不失私密。我们去露台吧。外面有雕塑。

​​嘉宾A:​​ 好主意。这里的外部空间和内部一样重要。是完美的城市绿洲。

'''

== The City Planning Office

​​Planner A:​​ We need to construct a new viaduct to span the river. The dam upstream is causing traffic to obstruct the downtown bridges.

​​Planner B:​​ I agree. The infrastructure in this peripheral area needs an upgrade. We should establish a new design that includes a plaza.

​​Planner A:​​ Good thinking. The vicinity around the new viaduct could become a new urban center. People might settle there.

​​Planner B:​​ Exactly. We can zone some areas for apartments, and even a hostel for students. We need to modify the existing grid layout.

​​Planner A:​​ Let's not forget green spaces. An expanse of parkland. People need places to reside and relax. The inner city is too cramped.

​​Planner B:​​ True. We'll need to work with masons and carpenters. The arch of the viaduct will be a key feature. It could be a new landmark.

​​Planner A:​​ This project will take years. But it's essential. We're not just building roads; we're building a community.

城市规划办公室

​​规划师A:​​ 我们需要建一座新高架桥来跨越河流。上游的水坝导致交通堵塞了市中心的桥梁。

​​规划师B:​​ 我同意。这个边缘地区的基础设施需要升级。我们应该建立一个包含广场的新设计。

​​规划师A:​​ 好想法。新高架桥周围可能成为新的城市中心。人们可能会在那里定居。

​​规划师B:​​ 正是。我们可以划出一些区域建公寓，甚至为学生建旅社。需要修改现有的网格布局。

​​规划师A:​​ 别忘了绿地。一片广阔的公园用地。人们需要居住和放松的地方。内城太拥挤了。

​​规划师B:​​ 没错。我们需要和石匠、木匠合作。高架桥的拱门将是一个关键特征。它可能成为新地标。

​​规划师A:​​ 这个项目需要多年时间。但至关重要。我们不只是修路；我们是在建设社区。

'''

== The Hotel Lobby

​​Guest:​​ Excuse me, where is the lavatory? I need to use the toilet.

​​Receptionist:​​ Of course, sir. Go down this corridor. Take the first aisle on your left. It's near the casino entrance.

​​Guest:​​ Thank you. Also, is there a parlour where I can wait for my friend? Perhaps with a bench?

​​Receptionist:​​ Yes, there's a sitting area with several benches. It's through that archway. Would you like me to reserve a table for you at the restaurant?

​​Guest:​​ Not yet, thank you. I might just get a snack from the booth in the mall later. Is the swimming pool outside?

​​Receptionist:​​ No, it's an internal pool. But there is an external terrace with a great view. The elevator to the upper floors is just past the reception desk.

​​Guest:​​ Perfect. Thank you for your help. This is a very well-designed hotel.

酒店大堂

​​客人:​​ 打扰一下，洗手间在哪里？我需要用一下。

​​接待员:​​ 当然，先生。沿着这条走廊走。在第一个过道左转。靠近赌场入口。

​​客人:​​ 谢谢。另外，有休息室可以等我朋友吗？也许有长椅的？

​​接待员:​​ 有，有个休息区，有几张长椅。穿过那个拱门。需要我为您在餐厅预订座位吗？

​​客人:​​ 暂时不用，谢谢。我可能稍后从商场摊位买点小吃。游泳池在外面吗？

​​接待员:​​ 不，是室内游泳池。但有个外部露台，视野很好。上楼的电梯就在接待台后面。

​​客人:​​ 完美。谢谢你的帮助。这家酒店设计得很好。

'''

== The Artist's Studio

​​Artist:​​ This studio has great light. The ceiling is high, and the room is spacious. Perfect for large canvases.

​​Visitor:​​ It's wonderful. I love how you've used the space. The placement of that sculpture near the window is ideal.

​​Artist:​​ Thank you. I need a lot of room to work. Sometimes I have to assemble large pieces. I've even installed a small crane for the really heavy stuff.

​​Visitor:​​ Smart. What's in that cabinet? Tools?

​​Artist:​​ Yes, all my apparatus. Saws, drills, screws. I sometimes need to weld or trim metal for my work.

​​Visitor:​​ Amazing. It's more like a workshop than a studio. Do you ever feel the need to escape the internal world and go outside for inspiration?

​​Artist:​​ All the time. I often go to the plaza to sketch. The outward appearance of buildings fascinates me. But I always come back here to create. It's my shelter.

艺术家的工作室

​​艺术家:​​ 这个工作室光线很好。天花板高，房间宽敞。适合大画布。

​​访客:​​ 太棒了。我喜欢你对空间的利用。雕塑放在窗边很理想。

​​艺术家:​​ 谢谢。我需要很大的工作空间。有时要组装大件。我甚至装了台小起重机处理重物。

​​访客:​​ 聪明。柜子里是什么？工具？

​​艺术家:​​ 是的，我所有的设备。锯子、电钻、螺丝。我有时需要焊接或修剪金属来做作品。

​​访客:​​ 了不起。这更像车间而不是工作室。你是否觉得需要逃离内部世界，去外面寻找灵感？

​​艺术家:​​ 经常。我常去广场写生。建筑的外观让我着迷。但我总是回到这里创作。这是我的庇护所。

'''

== The Architectural Digest Interview

​​Journalist:​​ This is a magnificent villa. The architecture is stunning. When was it founded?

​​Owner:​​ Thank you! The main house was founded in 1920. But the lodge by the lake is older. It was built as a hunting cabin.

​​Journalist:​​ I see. And the tile work on these vaulted ceilings is exquisite. Are those original?

​​Owner:​​ Yes, they are. The tiles are hand-painted. We've taken great care to maintain the original character.

​​Journalist:​​ It shows. The living room is so spacious. And I love the radiator covers; they look like art pieces.

​​Owner:​​ That was my grandmother's touch. She believed every detail mattered, even the things meant to be hidden.

建筑文摘采访

​​记者:​​ 这栋别墅非常宏伟。建筑风格令人惊叹。它是什么时候建成的？

​​主人:​​ 谢谢！主楼建于1920年。但湖边的那个小屋更老。它最初是作为狩猎小屋建造的。

​​记者:​​ 明白了。这些拱形天花板上的瓷砖工艺非常精美。是原装的吗？

​​主人:​​ 是的，是原装的。瓷砖是手绘的。我们非常注意保持其原始特色。

​​记者:​​ 看得出来。客厅非常宽敞。我很喜欢这些暖气罩；它们看起来像艺术品。

​​主人:​​ 那是我祖母的主意。她认为每个细节都很重要，即使是那些本应被隐藏起来的东西。

'''

== The Historic Castle Tour

​​Tour Guide:​​ Welcome to the castle! It's situated on a cliff for defense. The foundation was laid in the 12th century.

​​Tourist A:​​ Amazing! So people have inhabited this place for over 800 years?

​​Tour Guide:​​ That's right. Now, watch your step as we enter the great hall. Please use the handrail.

​​Tourist B:​​ Wow! Look at the height of this ceiling! It's like a huge vault. And the windows are so small.

​​Tour Guide:​​ Yes, defense was the priority. Now, if you'll follow me inward, we'll descend to the cellar. It's quite damp.

​​Tourist A:​​ It's chilly down here. Is that the original stone?

​​Tour Guide:​​ It is. This is where they stored food and wine. It's almost airtight, which helped with preservation.

​​Tourist B:​​ I can imagine. It feels like stepping back in time. What's through that low door?

​​Tour Guide:​​ Ah, that leads to the old nursery. They found a cradle from the 1600s in there during the restoration.

古堡游览

​​导游:​​ 欢迎来到这座城堡！它坐落于悬崖之上，是为了防御。地基是在12世纪奠定的。

​​游客A:​​ 太神奇了！这么说人们在这里居住了800多年？

​​导游:​​ 没错。现在，我们进入大厅，请小心脚下。请扶好扶手。

​​游客B:​​ 哇！看这天花板的高度！像个巨大的拱顶。窗户真小。

​​导游:​​ 是的，防御是首要任务。现在，请跟我往里走，我们将下到地窖。这里相当潮湿。

​​游客A:​​ 下面真冷。这是原来的石头吗？

​​导游:​​ 是的。这是他们储存食物和酒的地方。几乎是密封的，有助于保存。

​​游客B:​​ 我可以想象。感觉就像回到了过去。那扇矮门通向哪里？

​​导游:​​ 啊，那是通往旧育儿室的。在修复过程中，他们在里面发现了一个17世纪的摇篮。

'''

== The Mountain Hut Adventure

​​Hiker A:​​ According to the map, the ranger's hut should be located near this stream. I hope it's still standing.

​​Hiker B:​​ There! I see it! Nestled under the eaves of those large trees. It looks rustic.

​​Hiker A:​​ "Rustic" is a kind word. It looks like a strong wind from the wrong pole could knock it over!

​​Hiker B:​​ (Laughs) Don't be so dramatic. It's been here for decades. It's a basic shelter, but it should be watertight. Let's enter.

​​Hiker A:​​ Okay. The entry is low. Duck your head! Wow, it's just one room. A true one-room cabin.

​​Hiker B:​​ It's cozy. Look, there's a fireplace. And the walls have an extra layer of insulation. Smart.

​​Hiker A:​​ Yeah, it's not bad. It'll be a good place to lodge for the night. Better than a tent if it rains.

​​Hiker B:​​ Definitely. Let's get a fire going. I'm already feeling an inward sense of peace here.

山间小屋探险

​​徒步者A:​​ 根据地图，护林员的小屋应该在这条小溪附近。希望它还在。

​​徒步者B:​​ 在那儿！我看到了！藏在那几棵大树伸出的屋檐下。看起来很有乡村气息。

​​徒步者A:​​ "乡村气息"这个词用得很客气。看起来一阵不对的风向就能把它吹倒！

​​徒步者B:​​ (笑) 别那么夸张。它在这里几十年了。是个基本的庇护所，但应该能防雨。我们进去吧。

​​徒步者A:​​ 好。入口很低。低头！哇，就一个房间。真正的一室户小屋。

​​徒步者B:​​ 很舒适。看，有个壁炉。墙壁还有额外的隔热层。聪明。

​​徒步者A:​​ 是啊，不错。是过夜的好地方。如果下雨，比帐篷强。

​​徒步者B:​​ 当然。我们生火吧。在这里我已经感到一种内心的平静了。

'''

== The Skyscraper Construction Site

​​Engineer A:​​ The foundation for this skyscraper is incredible. We had to go down multiple layers to hit bedrock.

​​Engineer B:​​ I know. The suspension system for the elevator cores is state-of-the-art. It allows for more flexible interior layouts.

​​Engineer A:​​ Right. And look at the glass curtain wall. Each panel is designed to be completely airtight. Energy efficiency is key.

​​Engineer B:​​ Absolutely. We're also installing a new type of radiator that's more efficient. It'll be located behind the living room walls in each apartment.

​​Engineer A:​​ Good. Have the masons finished the tile work in the lobby vault?

​​Engineer B:​​ Almost. They're putting the final touches on it. Once that's done, we can begin the inward fit-out of the commercial spaces on the lower floors.

​​Engineer A:​​ Excellent. This project is really taking shape. It will be a new landmark.

摩天大楼建筑工地

​​工程师A:​​ 这栋摩天大楼的地基非常惊人。我们向下挖了很多层才到达基岩。

​​工程师B:​​ 我知道。电梯井核心筒的悬挂系统是最先进的。它允许更灵活的内部布局。

​​工程师A:​​ 对。看那玻璃幕墙。每一块面板都设计成完全气密的。能源效率是关键。

​​工程师B:​​ 绝对是的。我们还在安装一种更高效的新型暖气片。它将位于每个公寓客厅墙壁的后方。

​​工程师A:​​ 好的。石匠完成大厅拱顶的瓷砖工作了吗？

​​工程师B:​​ 快好了。他们正在做最后的修饰。一旦完成，我们就可以开始低层商业空间的内部装修了。

​​工程师A:​​ 太好了。这个项目真的成型了。它将成为一个新的地标。

'''

== The Grand Mansion Estate

​​Realtor:​​ This mansion is truly one of a kind. It was founded by a shipping magnate in the 1890s.

​​Client:​​ It's breathtaking. The scale is immense. It's more like a castle than a house!

​​Realtor:​​ (Chuckles) It does have that feel. Notice the architecture? It's a blend of several styles. The previous owners added a tile roof with wide eaves.

​​Client:​​ I see. And how many rooms are there? I see a solarium, what I assume is a living room, and is that a nursery?

​​Realtor:​​ Yes, that was a nursery. It still has the original wallpaper. There are 20 rooms in total, not including the cellar. The cellar is quite vast.

​​Client:​​ Incredible. And the grounds? Is there a guest lodge?

​​Realtor:​​ There is. A small but charming cabin situated near the edge of the woods. It's very private. Shall we go take a look?

​​Client:​​ Please! I need to see if my inward desire for a project this big matches reality!

豪华庄园

​​房产经纪人:​​ 这座庄园真是独一无二。它是由一位航运大亨在19世纪90年代建造的。

​​客户:​​ 令人惊叹。规模真大。更像一座城堡而不是房子！

​​房产经纪人:​​ (轻笑) 确实有那种感觉。注意到建筑风格了吗？它是几种风格的融合。前主人加装了带有宽大屋檐的瓦片屋顶。

​​客户:​​ 看到了。有多少个房间？我看到一个日光浴室，一个应该是客厅，那是个育儿室吗？

​​房产经纪人:​​ 是的，那曾是育儿室。还保留着原来的墙纸。总共有20个房间，不包括地窖。地窖相当大。

​​客户:​​ 不可思议。场地呢？有客人小屋吗？

​​房产经纪人:​​ 有的。一栋小巧而迷人的小屋，坐落在树林边缘。非常私密。我们去看看吗？

​​客户:​​ 请带路！我需要看看我内心对这么大一个项目的渴望是否与现实相符！

'''

== The Bathroom Renovation

​​Homeowner:​​ The new bathroom is almost perfect. But are you sure the shower head is plumb? It looks a little crooked.

​​Plumber:​​ Let me check. (Uses a level) Hmm, you're right. It's off by a few degrees. I'll need to adjust the pipes behind the wall.

​​Homeowner:​​ Okay. While you're at it, can you check the tile in the corner? I'm worried it's not sealed properly against the wall.

​​Plumber:​​ Sure thing. I'll make sure it's airtight. We don't want any water getting in there. It could damage the structure.

​​Homeowner:​​ Exactly. This old house has good bones, but the plumbing needs to be perfect.

​​Plumber:​​ Don't worry. I'll get it right. A good plumb line is the foundation of any good renovation!

​​Homeowner:​​ (Laughs) I'll take your word for it. Just make sure I can take a straight shower!

浴室翻新

​​房主:​​ 新浴室几乎完美了。但你确定花洒是垂直的吗？看起来有点歪。

​​水管工:​​ 我检查一下。(使用水平尺) 嗯，你说得对。偏了几度。我需要调整墙后的管道。

​​房主:​​ 好的。你修的时候，能顺便检查一下角落的瓷砖吗？我担心它和墙之间的密封没做好。

​​水管工:​​ 没问题。我会确保它是密封的。我们不想让任何水渗进去。会损坏结构的。

​​房主:​​ 正是。这老房子结构不错，但管道必须完美。

​​水管工:​​ 别担心。我会搞好的。垂直准线是任何成功翻修的基础！

​​房主:​​ (笑) 我相信你。只要确保我能洗个"直"的澡就行！
