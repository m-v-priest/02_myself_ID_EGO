== The Restaurant Review

​​Diner A:​​ I have a huge appetite today. Let's look at the menu. I'm thinking of ordering the spicy beef dish.

​​Diner B:​​ That sounds delicious, but I'm a vegetarian. I'll probably get the vegetable stir-fry. The chef here is a gourmet, so it should be tasty.

​​Diner A:​​ Good point. Should we get an appetiser to share? Maybe some spring rolls? And what about drinks? I'm thirsty.

​​Diner B:​​ I'll just have a soda. You go ahead and get a whisky if you want. Just don't get drunk before the main course!

​​Diner A:​​ (Laughs) No promises! The food here has such a rich flavour. The sauce is always perfect. I love the ginger and garlic they use.

​​Waiter:​​ Are you ready to order?

​​Diner A:​​ Yes, we'll have the spicy beef, the vegetable stir-fry, an order of spring rolls, a soda, and a whisky.

​​Waiter:​​ Excellent choices. Your food will be ready shortly.

餐厅点评

​​食客A:​​ 我今天胃口很好。我们看看菜单吧。我想点辣味牛肉。

​​食客B:​​ 听起来很美味，但我是素食者。我可能要蔬菜炒菜。这里的厨师是美食家，所以应该很好吃。

​​食客A:​​ 有道理。我们要不要分享一份开胃菜？春卷怎么样？喝的呢？我渴了。

​​食客B:​​ 我就要苏打水。你想喝威士忌就点吧。主菜上来前别喝醉就行！

​​食客A:​​ (笑) 不敢保证！这里的食物味道很浓郁。酱汁总是很完美。我喜欢他们用的姜和蒜。

​​服务员:​​ 准备好点餐了吗？

​​食客A:​​ 是的，我们要辣味牛肉、蔬菜炒菜、一份春卷、一杯苏打水和一杯威士忌。

​​服务员:​​ 不错的选择。您的食物很快就好。

'''

== The Cooking Experiment

​​Chef:​​ Okay, for this recipe, we need to grind these spices first. The flavour comes from fresh ginger, garlic, and a little chili for a spicy kick.

​​Sous Chef:​​ Got it. Should I peel the potatoes and carrots? Then I can slice them for the pot.

​​Chef:​​ Yes, please. And we'll need to soak the beans beforehand. They need to soften. We'll cook them on the stove with the pork.

​​Sous Chef:​​ What about the sauce? Ketchup and vinegar?

​​Chef:​​ Actually, we'll make a special sauce. We'll squeeze a lemon, add some honey, and a bit of mustard. It will be sweet and sour.

​​Sous Chef:​​ Yummy! I'll get the pot and pan ready. Should I preheat the oven for the bread?

​​Chef:​​ Good idea. We'll bake a small loaf to go with the soup. This is going to be a delicious supper!

烹饪实验

​​主厨:​​ 好了，做这道菜，我们需要先研磨这些香料。味道来自新鲜的姜、蒜和一点辣椒提辣味。

​​助理厨师:​​ 明白。要削土豆和胡萝卜的皮吗？然后我可以切片下锅。

​​主厨:​​ 是的，谢谢。我们需要提前泡豆子。它们需要变软。我们要和猪肉一起在炉子上煮。

​​助理厨师:​​ 酱汁呢？番茄酱和醋？

​​主厨:​​ 其实，我们要做一种特别的酱汁。挤一个柠檬，加一些蜂蜜，还有一点芥末。会是酸甜味的。

​​助理厨师:​​ 好吃！我去准备锅。要预热烤箱烤面包吗？

​​主厨:​​ 好主意。我们烤一个小面包配汤。这将是美味的晚餐！

'''

== The Healthy Diet Plan

​​Friend A:​​ I need to change my diet. I'm always hungry for junk food. I want to eat more edible whole foods like fruits and vegetables.

​​Friend B:​​ That's a great idea. You can start with a big salad for lunch. Lots of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and some nuts for crunch.

​​Friend A:​​ Good plan. And for a snack, instead of candy, I can have an apple or a pear. Maybe with a little peanut butter?

​​Friend B:​​ Perfect! And drink lots of water or herbal tea when you feel thirsty. It helps with digestion. Avoid too much sugar and salt.

​​Friend A:​​ It's hard! I love the flavour of chocolate and ice cream.

​​Friend B:​​ It's okay to have a treat sometimes! Just not every day. Maybe once a week, you can have a small piece of dark chocolate. It's all about balance.

健康饮食计划

​​朋友A:​​ 我需要改变饮食了。我总是想吃垃圾食品。我想多吃些可食用的天然食物，比如水果和蔬菜。

​​朋友B:​​ 好主意。你可以午餐吃一大份沙拉。很多生菜、番茄、黄瓜，还有一些坚果增加口感。

​​朋友A:​​ 好计划。零食方面，不吃糖果，可以吃个苹果或梨。也许配点花生酱？

​​朋友B:​​ 完美！渴的时候多喝水或花草茶。有助于消化。避免摄入过多的糖和盐。

​​朋友A:​​ 很难！我喜欢巧克力和冰淇淋的味道。

​​朋友B:​​ 偶尔犒劳一下自己没关系！只是不要每天。也许每周一次，你可以吃一小块黑巧克力。关键是平衡。

'''

== The Grand Banquet

​​Host:​​ The banquet is tomorrow! We need to cater for fifty people. Let's finalise the menu.

​​Event Planner:​​ The main course will be roast chicken with potatoes. For the vegetarian option, a pasta dish with mushroom sauce.

​​Host:​​ Good. And for appetisers? We need a variety. Some things they can eat with a fork or spoon, others they can just pick up.

​​Event Planner:​​ We'll have small sandwiches, a fruit platter with melon and grapes, and some biscuits with cheese. For dessert, a chocolate pudding.

​​Host:​​ Excellent. And the drinks? We'll have juice, soda, coffee, and a selection of alcohol, including brandy. But we must ensure no one gets drunk!

​​Event Planner:​​ Of course. We'll have plenty of water available too. The cutlery is all silver, and the dishes are ceramic. It will be a lovely evening.

盛大宴会

​​主人:​​ 明天就是宴会了！我们需要为五十人提供餐饮。最后确定一下菜单。

​​活动策划:​​ 主菜是烤鸡配土豆。素食选项是蘑菇酱意面。

​​主人:​​ 好。开胃菜呢？我们需要种类多样。有些可以用叉子或勺子吃，其他的可以直接拿。

​​活动策划:​​ 我们会准备小份三明治、有瓜和葡萄的水果拼盘，还有一些配奶酪的饼干。甜点是巧克力布丁。

​​主人:​​ 太好了。饮料呢？我们有果汁、苏打水、咖啡和一系列酒，包括白兰地。但我们必须确保没人喝醉！

​​活动策划:​​ 当然。我们也会提供充足的水。餐具是银制的，盘子是陶瓷的。这将是一个美好的夜晚。

'''

== The Quick Snack

​​Student A:​​ I'm so hungry! I need a snack before my next class. Let's go to the cafeteria.

​​Student B:​​ Okay, but make it quick. What are you going to get? A hamburger? A slice of pizza?

​​Student A:​​ Maybe just a yogurt and a banana. I need something easy to digest. I don't want to feel sleepy.

​​Student B:​​ That's smart. I'll just get a coffee in a mug. I need the caffeine to stay awake!

​​Student A:​​ (Laughs) I know the feeling. Okay, let's go. I hope the line isn't too long.

快餐

​​学生A:​​ 我好饿！下节课前我需要吃点零食。我们去食堂吧。

​​学生B:​​ 好的，但要快。你要买什么？汉堡？一片披萨？

​​学生A:​​ 也许就酸奶和香蕉吧。我需要容易消化的东西。我不想犯困。

​​学生B:​​ 聪明。我就要一杯咖啡。我需要咖啡因保持清醒！

​​学生A:​​ (笑) 我懂。好了，走吧。希望排队不长。

'''

== The Grocery Shopping Trip

​​Shopper A:​​ Okay, we need provisions for the week. Let's start in the dairy section. We need milk, butter, and cheese.

​​Shopper B:​​ Got it. And let's get some yogurt too. For fruit, how about some oranges, peaches, and maybe a kiwi?

​​Shopper A:​​ Good idea. Now, for vegetables. We need onions, cabbage, and some fresh peas. Oh, and don't forget the turnips for the soup.

​​Shopper B:​​ I'll grab a tin of tomatoes as well. It's always good to have. What about protein? Fish? Or some turkey?

​​Shopper A:​​ Let's get both. We can have fish one night and roast turkey another. I'll see if they have any good sausage too.

​​Shopper B:​​ This is quite a haul! Our fridge will be full. I'm already thinking about the delicious meals we can cook.

​​Shopper A:​​ Me too! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Let's go through the checkout. I hope we have enough bags!

杂货店购物

​​顾客A:​​ 好了，我们需要一周的储备。从奶制品区开始吧。需要牛奶、黄油和奶酪。

​​顾客B:​​ 明白。再买点酸奶。水果呢？橙子、桃子，也许来个猕猴桃？

​​顾客A:​​ 好主意。现在蔬菜。需要洋葱、卷心菜和一些新鲜豌豆。哦，别忘了做汤的萝卜。

​​顾客B:​​ 我再拿一罐番茄。备着总是好的。蛋白质呢？鱼？还是火鸡？

​​顾客A:​​ 两样都买吧。一晚吃鱼，另一晚烤火鸡。我看看有没有好香肠。

​​顾客B:​​ 买了不少啊！冰箱要满了。我已经在想我们能做的好吃饭菜了。

​​顾客A:​​ 我也是！光想想就饿了。我们去结账吧。希望袋子够用！

'''

== The Fancy Dinner Party

​​Host:​​ Welcome, welcome! Please, have a drink. We have various beverages: juice, wine, even a fine liquor if you prefer.

​​Guest:​​ Thank you! This is a beautiful spread. The cutlery is lovely. Is that porcelain?

​​Host:​​ Yes, it is. And the glasses are crystal. Now, let me tell you about the menu. The main course is a pasta dish, specifically spaghetti with a special sauce.

​​Guest:​​ Wonderful! I see a tray of appetisers over there. What are those?

​​Host:​​ Those are mini sandwiches, and next to them is a bowl of mixed nuts. Please, help yourself. There's also a selection of pies for dessert.

​​Guest:​​ Everything looks so tasty. You've outdone yourself! The flavour in this sauce is incredible. Is that a hint of vanilla?

​​Host:​​ You have a keen palate! Yes, just a touch. I'm so glad you like it. Please, enjoy the evening!

优雅晚宴

​​主人:​​ 欢迎，欢迎！请喝点东西。有各种饮料：果汁、葡萄酒，如果您喜欢还有上等烈酒。

​​客人:​​ 谢谢！布置真漂亮。餐具很可爱。是瓷器吗？

​​主人:​​ 是的。杯子是水晶的。现在，说说菜单。主菜是意面，特制酱汁的意大利面。

​​客人:​​ 太好了！我看到那边一盘开胃菜。是什么？

​​主人:​​ 是迷你三明治，旁边是一碗混合坚果。请自便。甜点还有各种派。

​​客人:​​ 看起来都很好吃。你太棒了！这酱汁味道好极了。有点香草味？

​​主人:​​ 您味觉真敏锐！是的，只加了一点。很高兴您喜欢。请享受今晚！

'''

== The Cozy Café

​​Customer A:​​ I'll just have a black coffee, please. In a mug, not a glass.

​​Barista:​​ Of course. And for you?

​​Customer B:​​ I'd like a tea. Do you have any herbal blends? Maybe something with ginger?

​​Barista:​​ We have a lovely ginger and lemon tea. Would you like honey with that?

​​Customer B:​​ Yes, please. That sounds perfect. Are those biscuits fresh?

​​Barista:​​ Baked this morning! We have plain ones and some with jam.

​​Customer A:​​ I'll take one with jam. I need a little sweet treat. It's so cozy in here. A great place to relax.

​​Barista:​​ Here you go. Enjoy!

舒适咖啡馆

​​顾客A:​​ 我要杯黑咖啡，谢谢。用马克杯，不要玻璃杯。

​​咖啡师:​​ 好的。您呢？

​​顾客B:​​ 我想要茶。有花草茶吗？也许含姜的？

​​咖啡师:​​ 我们有很好的姜柠茶。要加蜂蜜吗？

​​顾客B:​​ 要，谢谢。听起来很棒。饼干是新鲜的吗？

​​咖啡师:​​ 今早烤的！有原味的和果酱的。

​​顾客A:​​ 我要个果酱的。需要点甜食。这里真舒适。放松的好地方。

​​咖啡师:​​ 您的餐齐了。请慢用！

'''

== The Student Refectory

​​Student A:​​ I'm so hungry after that lecture. Let's grab something from the refectory buffet.

​​Student B:​​ Good idea. I hope they have something decent. Last time, the porridge was like paste. And the corn was tough.

​​Student A:​​ (Laughs) True. But I'm not picky today. Look, they have a takeaway bar for salads. I'll get a bowl with radish and scallions.

​​Student B:​​ I might get the hot meal. It looks like mutton stew. I need something hearty to swallow after chewing on that textbook all morning.

​​Student A:​​ Smart. I'll just have a quick snack as a refreshment. Then I need to study. I want to stay sober for my exam.

​​Student B:​​ Me too. No cigarettes or tobacco for me today! I need my wits about me. Let's eat and then hit the books.

学生食堂

​​学生A:​​ 上完那堂课我饿坏了。我们去食堂自助餐吃点东西吧。

​​学生B:​​ 好主意。希望有像样的东西。上次的粥像糨糊。玉米也很老。

​​学生A:​​ (笑) 没错。但今天我不挑剔。看，他们有外卖沙拉吧。我要一碗有萝卜和葱的。

​​学生B:​​ 我可能吃热餐。看起来像炖羊肉。啃了一上午课本，我需要点实在的东西咽下去。

​​学生A:​​ 聪明。我就吃点快餐当点心。然后我得学习。考试要保持清醒。

​​学生B:​​ 我也是。今天不碰香烟或烟草！我需要保持头脑清醒。我们吃完就去啃书本。

'''

== The Farm Visit

​​City Dweller:​​ Wow, look at all the crops! Is that wheat over there?

​​Farmer:​​ Yes, that's wheat. We'll reap it soon. And that field is corn. The grain looks good this year.

​​City Dweller:​​ Amazing. And what about livestock? Do you have animals?

​​Farmer:​​ We do. We raise sheep for mutton. They graze by the pond. We also have a few chickens.

​​City Dweller:​​ I see. What's that building with the big furnace?

​​Farmer:​​ That's where we dry the grain. We also grind some into flour there. It's hard work.

​​City Dweller:​​ I bet. It must be satisfying to see the fruit of your labor. It really makes you appreciate your food.

农场参观

​​城市居民:​​ 哇，看这些庄稼！那边是小麦吗？

​​农民:​​ 是的，是小麦。我们很快要收割了。那片地是玉米。今年的谷物看起来不错。

​​城市居民:​​ 太棒了。那牲畜呢？你们养动物吗？

​​农民:​​ 养。我们养羊产羊肉。它们在池塘边吃草。我们还养了几只鸡。

​​城市居民:​​ 明白了。那个有大炉子的建筑是什么？

​​农民:​​ 那是我们烘干谷物的地方。我们也把一些磨成面粉。是辛苦活。

​​城市居民:​​ 肯定是。看到劳动成果一定很满足。这真的让你更珍惜食物。

'''

== The Exotic Food Market

​​Foodie A:​​ This market is incredible! Look at this exotic cuisine. What's this purple thing?

​​Vendor:​​ That's eggplant, sir. Very fresh. And these are fresh plums. Sweet, not bitter.

​​Foodie A:​​ Great! And what are these red berries?

​​Vendor:​​ Those are cherries. And this is a papaya. You can eat the flesh, but don't swallow the seeds. The hull is not edible.

​​Foodie B:​​ I'm fascinated by these spices. What's this green paste?

​​Vendor:​​ That's wasabi. Very spicy! And this is pepper. Be careful, it can make you sneeze!

​​Foodie A:​​ We'll take some of everything. We want to try new ingredients. Maybe we'll have a barbecue tonight.

​​Foodie B:​​ Perfect! We can make a sauce with these. It'll be a great supplement to the meat. Let's go pay.

异国食品市场

​​美食家A:​​ 这个市场太棒了！看这些异国菜肴。这个紫色的东西是什么？

​​摊主:​​ 先生，那是茄子。很新鲜。这些是新鲜的李子。甜的，不苦。

​​美食家A:​​ 太好了！这些红色的浆果呢？

​​摊主:​​ 那些是樱桃。这是木瓜。你可以吃肉，但别吞籽。外壳不能吃。

​​美食家B:​​ 我对这些香料很着迷。这绿色糊状物是什么？

​​摊主:​​ 那是芥末。很辣！这是胡椒。小心，它会让你打喷嚏！

​​美食家A:​​ 我们每样都买点。我们想尝试新食材。也许今晚可以烧烤。

​​美食家B:​​ 完美！我们可以用这些做酱汁。是肉的好补充。我们去付钱吧。

'''

== The Cozy Kitchen

​​Home Cook A:​​ Okay, I'm making porridge. Can you pass me the kettle? I need hot water.

​​Home Cook B:​​ Sure. Here you go. What's in it? Just oats and water?

​​Home Cook A:​​ I add a bit of flour to thicken it. And some berries for flavour. Maybe a plum or two.

​​Home Cook B:​​ Nice. I'll make some toast. I'll use the knife to slice this bread. Do we have butter?

​​Home Cook A:​​ In the fridge. Check under the lid of that blue dish. Be careful, the knife is sharp!

​​Home Cook B:​​ Don't worry, I'm sober! I won't cut myself. Oh, we're out of butter. I'll just use a bit of honey.

​​Home Cook A:​​ That works. This hunger is making me impatient. I just want to lick the spoon!

​​Home Cook B:​​ (Laughs) Hold on! It's almost ready. We can dip our toast in the porridge. Yum!

舒适厨房

​​家庭厨师A:​​ 好了，我要煮粥了。能把水壶递给我吗？我需要热水。

​​家庭厨师B:​​ 当然。给。里面放什么？只有燕麦和水？

​​家庭厨师A:​​ 我加点面粉让它变稠。放点浆果调味。可能放一两个李子。

​​家庭厨师B:​​ 好的。我做点吐司。用刀切面包。有黄油吗？

​​家庭厨师A:​​ 冰箱里。蓝色盘子盖下面看看。小心，刀很锋利！

​​家庭厨师B:​​ 别担心，我很清醒！不会切到自己的。哦，黄油没了。我就用点蜂蜜吧。

​​家庭厨师A:​​ 也行。饿得我不耐烦了。我真想舔勺子！

​​家庭厨师B:​​ (笑) 等等！快好了。我们可以用吐司蘸粥吃。好吃！

'''

== The Fancy Dinner Party

​​Host:​​ Welcome! Please, try the appetisers. Don't be shy. There's a bowl of dip for the vegetables.

​​Guest A:​​ Thank you. Everything looks exquisite. What's in this dip? It has a unique scent, almost like perfume.

​​Host:​​ Oh, that's a special recipe with herbs. Now, for the main course, we have a choice of meat. The mutton is particularly good.

​​Guest B:​​ I'll have the mutton. I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse! I'll need a sharp knife to cut it.

​​Host:​​ (Chuckles) Of course. The side dish is grilled eggplant and corn on the cob. Please, chew thoroughly.

​​Guest A:​​ This is delicious. The flavours are so complex. Not bitter at all. What's for dessert?

​​Host:​​ We have ice cream! Homemade. And fresh berries. You can suck on the cherry pits if you like!

​​Guest B:​​ (Laughs) I think I'll just swallow the ice cream! It's too good to play with. A perfect end to the meal.

优雅晚宴

​​主人:​​ 欢迎！请尝尝开胃菜。别害羞。有碗蔬菜蘸酱。

​​客人A:​​ 谢谢。一切看起来都很精致。蘸酱里有什么？有独特的香味，几乎像香水。

​​主人:​​ 哦，那是香草特制配方。主菜有肉可选。羊肉特别好。

​​客人B:​​ 我要羊肉。饿得能吃下一匹马！需要快刀来切。

​​主人:​​ (轻笑) 当然。配菜是烤茄子和玉米棒子。请细嚼慢咽。

​​客人A:​​ 很好吃。味道很复杂。一点也不苦。甜点是什么？

​​主人:​​ 有冰淇淋！自制的。还有新鲜浆果。如果喜欢，你可以吮吸樱桃核！

​​客人B:​​ (笑) 我想我还是吞冰淇淋吧！太好吃了，不能玩。完美的餐后甜点。

'''

== The Fishing Trip

​​Angler A:​​ This is a peaceful pond. Perfect for fishing. Did you bring the rods?

​​Angler B:​​ Yep, right here. I also have some supplies. A thermos with coffee, and some sandwiches if we get hungry.

​​Angler A:​​ Good thinking. I hope we catch something. I'd love some fresh fish for supper.

​​Angler B:​​ Me too. Just remember, we have to remove the core and the scales. It's a bit of work.

​​Angler A:​​ I know, I know. I'll do the cleaning. You can cook. You're better at it.

​​Angler B:​​ Deal. I'll pan-fry it with a little pepper. Maybe a strip of bacon for flavour.

​​Angler A:​​ Now you're making me hungry! Let's just focus on catching one first. I feel a nibble!

钓鱼之旅

​​钓客A:​​ 这个池塘真安静。适合钓鱼。你带鱼竿了吗？

​​钓客B:​​ 带了，在这儿。我还带了补给。一壶咖啡，饿了还有三明治。

​​钓客A:​​ 想得周到。希望有收获。晚饭想吃鲜鱼。

​​钓客B:​​ 我也是。记住，得去内脏和鳞片。有点麻烦。

​​钓客A:​​ 知道，知道。我来清理。你做饭。你更擅长。

​​钓客B:​​ 成交。我用少量胡椒煎。也许加条培根提味。

​​钓客A:​​ 你说得我饿了！先专心钓一条吧。感觉有鱼咬饵了！

'''

== The Doctor's Visit

​​Dentist:​​ Okay, open wide. Let's have a look at your gums. Hmm, they look a bit inflamed. Do you chew gum a lot?

​​Patient:​​ Sometimes. Sugar-free. Is that bad?

​​Dentist:​​ It can be, if you do it too much. The constant chewing isn't great for your teeth or gums. I see you also have a tooth that needs a core build-up.

​​Patient:​​ Oh dear. That doesn't sound good. What causes that?

​​Dentist:​​ Often, it's from chewing on hard things. Or just wear and tear. We'll need to fix it. In the meantime, try to avoid very hard foods.

​​Patient:​​ I will. No more chewing ice! I promise. I need to keep my teeth to chew my food properly!

​​Dentist:​​ Exactly! Good oral health helps you swallow and digest your food better. Now, let's schedule that appointment.

看医生

​​牙医:​​ 好了，张大嘴。看看你的牙龈。嗯，有点发炎。你常嚼口香糖吗？

​​病人:​​ 有时嚼。无糖的。不好吗？

​​牙医:​​ 嚼太多可能不好。持续咀嚼对牙齿和牙龈不好。我还看到有颗牙需要做核心填充。

​​病人:​​ 天哪。听起来不妙。什么原因造成的？

​​牙医:​​ 通常是嚼硬物。或者只是磨损。我们需要修补。同时，尽量避免硬食。

​​病人:​​ 我会的。再也不嚼冰了！我保证。我需要牙齿来好好咀嚼食物！

​​牙医:​​ 没错！口腔健康有助于吞咽和消化食物。现在，我们预约一下时间。

'''

== The Afternoon Tea

​​Host:​​ Would you like more tea? I can pour from the kettle.

​​Guest:​​ Yes, please. But my cup is quite full. The saucer is already catching the drips!

​​Host:​​ Oh, let me get a fresh saucer for you. There we go. Now, try one of these pastries. They're not too sweet, just a hint of cherry.

​​Guest:​​ Thank you. They look lovely. I'll use the small knife to cut it. My hunger is finally gone after that big lunch.

​​Guest:​​ It's delicious. The flavour is perfect. Not bitter at all. This is a wonderful refreshment.

​​Host:​​ I'm glad you like it. It's a simple recipe. The main ingredient is almond paste. It's a nice supplement to a good cup of tea.

​​Guest:​​ It certainly is. A perfect way to spend the afternoon.

下午茶

​​主人:​​ 要加茶吗？我可以从壶里倒。

​​客人:​​ 好的，谢谢。但我的杯子很满了。茶碟已经在接水滴了！

​​主人:​​ 哦，我给你换个新茶碟。好了。尝尝这个糕点。不太甜，有一点樱桃味。

​​客人:​​ 谢谢。看起来很好吃。我用小刀切一下。吃完丰盛午餐，终于不饿了。

​​客人:​​ 很好吃。味道完美。一点也不苦。很棒的茶点。

​​主人:​​ 很高兴你喜欢。做法简单。主要成分是杏仁糊。是好茶的完美补充。

​​客人:​​ 确实是。度过下午的完美方式。
