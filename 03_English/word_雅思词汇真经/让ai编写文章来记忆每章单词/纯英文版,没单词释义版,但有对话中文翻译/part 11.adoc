== The Fashion Magazine Office

​​Editor:​​ We need to feature the current trend in our next issue. What's in vogue right now?

​​Assistant:​​ Well, oversized blazers are still popular. But there's a new tendency towards elegant, slender silhouettes.

​​Editor:​​ Perfect. We need a model who can embody that style. Someone who's a real fashion icon.

​​Assistant:​​ What about Clara? She has a graceful figure. She's perfect for high-end luxury brands.

​​Editor:​​ Excellent choice. Her appearance is exquisite. Now, for the jewellery. We need something to adorn the neckline. A simple gold chain, perhaps?

​​Assistant:​​ Or a jade necklace? That would be exquisite against a white silk gown.

​​Editor:​​ Yes! And we can embellish the story with a focus on sustainable textiles. It's a theme that prevails now.

​​Assistant:​​ Great. I'll get a tailor to adjust the garments. We want a perfect fit. No shabby seams or loose threads.

时尚杂志办公室

​​编辑:​​ 我们下一期需要报道当前趋势。现在流行什么？

​​助理:​​ 嗯， oversized 的西装外套仍然很受欢迎。但有个新趋势是优雅、修长的轮廓。

​​编辑:​​ 完美。我们需要一个能体现那种风格的模特。一个真正的时尚偶像。

​​助理:​​ Clara 怎么样？她体态优雅。非常适合高端奢侈品牌。

​​编辑:​​ 好选择。她的外表很精致。现在说首饰。需要点缀一下领口。也许一条简单的金链子？

​​助理:​​ 或者一条翡翠项链？配白色丝绸礼服会很精致。

​​编辑:​​ 对！我们可以用关注可持续纺织品的故事来润色。这是现在流行的主题。

​​助理:​​ 太好了。我找个裁缝来修改一下衣服。我们要合身。不要有蹩脚的缝线或松散的线头。

== The Costume Party Preparation

​​Friend A:​​ I'm so excited for the masquerade party! But I need a costume. What should I go as?

​​Friend B:​​ How about a mysterious figure in a cloak and veil? It's always fascinating.

​​Friend A:​​ Ooh, that sounds elegant. But I want something more colourful. Maybe a purple gown with a pink ribbon?

​​Friend B:​​ That could work. But is it decent for the theme? It might look a bit extravagant.

​​Friend A:​​ True. Maybe a simple but charming dress? A slender black number with a single jade bracelet.

​​Friend B:​​ Now you're talking. That's a pretty and stylish choice. You'll look beautiful.

​​Friend A:​​ Thanks! What about you?

​​Friend B:​​ I'm thinking of a handsome prince. I have an old uniform from a play. I just need to sew a button back on.

​​Friend A:​​ (Laughs) Just don't look too ugly if the mask slips! I'll help you with the make-up. I have some great cosmetics.

化妆舞会准备

​​朋友A:​​ 我对化妆舞会好兴奋！但我需要一套服装。我该扮成什么？

​​朋友B:​​ 披着斗篷和面纱的神秘人物怎么样？总是很迷人。

​​朋友A:​​ 哦，听起来很优雅。但我想要更鲜艳的。也许一件紫色礼服配粉色丝带？

​​朋友B:​​ 可能行。但符合主题吗？可能有点奢华了。

​​朋友A:​​ 没错。也许一条简单但有魅力的裙子？一件修长的黑色连衣裙，配一个玉手镯。

​​朋友B:​​ 这还差不多。这是个漂亮又时尚的选择。你会很美的。

​​朋友A:​​ 谢谢！你呢？

​​朋友B:​​ 我在想扮成英俊的王子。我有一件演戏穿的旧制服。只需要缝回去一个扣子。

​​朋友A:​​ (笑) 面具滑下来的时候别太丑就行！我帮你化妆。我有一些很好的化妆品。

== The Laundry Day Disaster

​​Roommate A:​​ Oh no! Look at this! My favourite white sweater turned pink!

​​Roommate B:​​ What happened? Did you mix it with a red garment in the laundry?

​​Roommate A:​​ I think so! The dye must have run. There's a big blot on it. It's ruined!

​​Roommate B:​​ Don't panic. Maybe we can fix it. We can try to dye it a darker colour. Like brown or grey.

​​Roommate A:​​ Do you think that will work? It's such a pretty sweater. I don't want it to look shabby.

​​Roommate B:​​ It's worth a try. We can get some pigment from the store. If it doesn't work, we can cut it up and use the fabric for a patch on your jeans.

​​Roommate A:​​ That's not a bad idea. A patch could be stylish. It's the current trend, right?

​​Roommate B:​​ Exactly! We can even stitch a design on it with some colourful thread. Turn a disaster into a fashion statement!

​​Roommate A:​​ You're a genius! Let's go to the textile shop. I need a new purse to match my new "vintage" sweater anyway.

洗衣日灾难

​​室友A:​​ 哦不！看这个！我最喜欢的白色毛衣变成粉色的了！

​​室友B:​​ 怎么回事？你是不是洗衣服时和一件红色衣服混在一起了？

​​室友A:​​ 我想是的！染料肯定掉了。上面有一大块污渍。毁了！

​​室友B:​​ 别慌。也许我们能修好。我们可以试着把它染成深色。比如棕色或灰色。

​​室友A:​​ 你觉得能行吗？这毛衣这么漂亮。我不想它看起来破旧。

​​室友B:​​ 值得一试。我们可以从商店买些颜料。如果不行，我们可以把它剪了，用布料给你牛仔裤打个补丁。

​​室友A:​​ 这主意不错。补丁可能很时髦。是现在的潮流，对吧？

​​室友B:​​ 没错！我们甚至可以用彩线在上面缝个图案。把灾难变成时尚宣言！

​​室友A:​​ 你真是个天才！我们去纺织品店吧。反正我需要个新钱包来配我的新"复古"毛衣。

== The Tailor's Fitting Room

​​Tailor:​​ Okay, let's see how this garment fits. The sleeves might be a bit tight.

​​Customer:​​ Ouch! Yes, they are. Can you let them out a little?

​​Tailor:​​ Of course. I can add a small patch under the arm. It won't be visible. Now, about the length of the trousers.

​​Customer:​​ I think they're good. I'll wear them with these boots, so no one will see the socks.

​​Tailor:​​ Very well. The collar is perfect. It frames your face nicely. A handsome cut.

​​Customer:​​ Thank you! I want it to look elegant for the event. Not too extravagant.

​​Tailor:​​ Understood. Simple elegance always prevails. I'll stitch the hem with a fine thread. It will be perfect.

​​Customer:​​ Great. Oh, and the button on this vest is loose. Can you sew it back on securely?

​​Tailor:​​ Yes, that's an easy fix. I'll use a stronger thread. Would you like a matching handkerchief for the breast pocket?

​​Customer:​​ That would be exquisite! Yes, please. You have such an eye for style.

裁缝试衣间

​​裁缝:​​ 好了，看看这件衣服合不合身。袖子可能有点紧。

​​顾客:​​ 哎哟！是的，很紧。能放一点吗？

​​裁缝:​​ 当然。我可以在腋下加个小衬布。看不出来。现在说裤长。

​​顾客:​​ 我觉得可以。我会配这双靴子穿，所以没人会看到袜子。

​​裁缝:​​ 很好。领子很完美。很好地衬托了你的脸型。很英俊的剪裁。

​​顾客:​​ 谢谢！我希望它看起来优雅，适合那个活动。不要太奢华。

​​裁缝:​​ 明白。简约的优雅总是流行的。我会用细线缝边。会很完美的。

​​顾客:​​ 太好了。哦，这件背心上的扣子松了。能把它缝牢吗？

​​裁缝:​​ 可以，小问题。我会用更结实的线。要配一块胸袋手帕吗？

​​顾客:​​ 那会非常精致！要，谢谢。你对时尚真有眼光。

== The Wardrobe Malfunction

​​Actor A:​​ This costume is a disaster! The strap on this gown is frayed. It's going to snap!

​​Actor B:​​ Calm down! Do we have a spare? Maybe a different dress?

​​Actor A:​​ There's no time! The curtain goes up in ten minutes! This velvet is so fragile. Look, the colour is already starting to fade near the seam.

​​Actor B:​​ Okay, okay. Think. We have a needle and thread in the emergency kit. I can stitch it back together quickly.

​​Actor A:​​ But it will be ugly! A big, obvious stitch right on the shoulder!

​​Actor B:​​ Better an ugly stitch than a naked actor on stage! Hold still. This will only take a second. I'll use a tan thread to blend in.

​​Actor A:​​ You're a lifesaver! I was so fascinated by this beautiful costume, I didn't check it properly.

​​Actor B:​​ There. Done. It's not perfect, but it will hold. Now, go break a leg! And try not to move that arm too much.

​​Actor A:​​ (Laughs nervously) Thanks! I owe you one. I'll buy you a new purse after the show!

衣柜故障

​​演员A:​​ 这套戏服太糟糕了！礼服上的带子磨损了。要断了！

​​演员B:​​ 冷静！有备用的吗？也许换条裙子？

​​演员A:​​ 没时间了！还有十分钟开幕！这天鹅绒太脆弱了。看，接缝附近的颜色已经开始褪了。

​​演员B:​​ 好了，好了。想想。急救箱里有针线。我可以快速缝回去。

​​演员A:​​ 但那会很难看！肩膀上有个明显的大针脚！

​​演员B:​​ 难看的针脚总比演员在台上光着强！别动。马上就好。我用棕褐色线，不明显。

​​演员A:​​ 你救了我！我光顾着迷这套漂亮戏服了，没好好检查。

​​演员B:​​ 好了。完成了。不完美，但能撑住。现在，去谢幕吧！尽量别动那只胳膊。

​​演员A:​​ (紧张地笑) 谢谢！我欠你一次。演出后我给你买个新钱包！

== The Thrift Store Treasure Hunt

​​Shopper A:​​ I love hunting for clothes in thrift stores. You can find real gems among the rags!

​​Shopper B:​​ I know! Look at this jacket. It has a slight stain on the collar, but it's a beautiful yellow colour.

​​Shopper A:​​ Oh, that's nice. The buttons are cool. But check out this hat! The brim is so wide. It would be perfect with a scarf.

​​Shopper B:​​ You'd look like a movie idol from the 50s! Very stylish. I'm looking for a warm wool sweater. Maybe grey or brown.

​​Shopper A:​​ Over here! This one looks handmade. Look at the embroidery on the sleeve. Someone took the time to ornament it with beads.

​​Shopper B:​​ Wow, that's exquisite work. It's not shabby at all. It's like a piece of jewellery you can wear.

​​Shopper A:​​ Exactly! And it's only a few dollars. What a find! We should clothe ourselves entirely from this place.

​​Shopper B:​​ (Laughs) Our own personal hairdressing and make-up might not match the vintage style, but we can try!

​​Shopper A:​​ True! Let's pay for these and go. I need to spin through the rack of skirts before we leave. I saw a purple one with a lace trim.

​​Shopper B:​​ Okay, but hurry! I want to see if they have any belts or gloves to complete our new old looks.

旧货店寻宝

​​顾客A:​​ 我喜欢在旧货店淘衣服。你能在破布堆里找到真正的宝贝！

​​顾客B:​​ 我知道！看这件夹克。领子上有点污渍，但是漂亮的黄色。

​​顾客A:​​ 哦，不错。扣子很酷。但看看这顶帽子！帽檐真宽。配条围巾会很好。

​​顾客B:​​ 你看起来会像50年代的电影偶像！很时尚。我在找件暖和的羊毛衫。也许灰色或棕色。

​​顾客A:​​ 这边！这件看起来是手工的。看袖子上的刺绣。有人花时间用珠子装饰它。

​​顾客B:​​ 哇，做工真精致。一点也不破旧。就像一件可以穿戴的首饰。

​​顾客A:​​ 没错！而且才几块钱。真是好发现！我们应该完全从这里买衣服穿。

​​顾客B:​​ (笑) 我们自己的发型和化妆可能不配这复古风格，但可以试试！

​​顾客A:​​ 没错！我们付钱走吧。离开前我得快速翻一下裙子架。我看到一条有蕾丝花边的紫色裙子。

​​顾客B:​​ 好，但快点！我想看看有没有腰带或手套来搭配我们的新复古造型。

'''

== The Winter Weather Wardrobe

​​Friend A:​​ Brr, it's freezing! I need my warmest clothes. Where's my overcoat?

​​Friend B:​​ In the wardrobe, I think. With the long robe? Don't forget your gloves and a stocking cap.

​​Friend A:​​ Got them. And my scarf. I'll wrap it tight. I hate it when the cold air gets up my sleeve.

​​Friend B:​​ Tell me about it. I'm wearing two pairs of socks with my boots. My feet are always cold.

​​Friend A:​​ Smart. I have a slight cold, so I need to bundle up. I look a bit ugly in all these layers, but it's better than being sick!

​​Friend B:​​ (Laughs) You look charming! Like a slightly plump, elegant bear. Very in vogue for Arctic explorers.

​​Friend A:​​ Very funny. Pass me that purse, will you? My wallet is inside. I need to buy a hot drink.

​​Friend B:​​ Here you go. Maybe you should get a new belt too. That one looks a bit ragged.

​​Friend A:​​ It's my lucky belt! It has a cool clasp. But you're right, it is looking a bit shabby. Okay, new belt it is. And maybe some new slippers for indoors.

​​Friend B:​​ Now you're talking! Let's go shopping after our coffee. We can find a pin to fix that loose strap on your overalls, too.

冬季衣橱

​​朋友A:​​ 呃，好冷！我需要最暖和的衣服。我的大衣呢？

​​朋友B:​​ 在衣橱里吧。和那件长袍一起？别忘了手套和针织帽。

​​朋友A:​​ 拿了。还有围巾。我会裹紧点。我讨厌冷风钻进袖子。

​​朋友B:​​ 可不是嘛。我穿了两双袜子配靴子。我的脚总是冷。

​​朋友A:​​ 聪明。我有点感冒，所以得穿暖和点。穿这么多层有点丑，但总比生病好！

​​朋友B:​​ (笑) 你很迷人！像只稍微圆滚滚的优雅熊。很受北极探险家欢迎。

​​朋友A:​​ 真好笑。把那个包递给我好吗？我钱包在里面。我得买杯热饮。

​​朋友B:​​ 给。也许你该买条新皮带。那条看起来有点破旧了。

​​朋友A:​​ 那是我的幸运皮带！搭扣很酷。但你说得对，是有点旧了。好吧，买新皮带。也许再买双室内拖鞋。

​​朋友B:​​ 这还差不多！喝完咖啡我们去购物。也能找个别针把你工装裤上松了的带子固定一下。

== The Fashion Design Studio

​​Designer:​​ I'm fascinated by the current trend. Stripes are making a huge comeback in popularity.

​​Assistant:​​ Absolutely. But which stripe? Wide? Thin? Multi-colored? We need to choose the right style for our new line of trousers.

​​Designer:​​ Let's start with something classic. A thin, elegant stripe. It has a certain grace. We can use it on both jeans and more formal trousers.

​​Assistant:​​ Good idea. And we can add a unique touch. Maybe embroider a small jewel motif along the pocket seam? Just a simple string of beads.

​​Designer:​​ I love that! It's a subtle detail that makes the garment special. But won't that make the jeans too fancy for everyday wear?

​​Assistant:​​ Not necessarily. If we keep the rest of the design simple, the embroidered jewel will be a fascinating focal point. It'll appeal to people who want something beyond basic denim.

​​Designer:​​ True. It's all about balance. Okay, let's draft a few samples. I'm excited to see how the stripe and the embroidery work together.

时装设计工作室

​​设计师:​​ 我对当前的趋势很着迷。条纹正强势回归，非常受欢迎。

​​助理:​​ 绝对是的。但是哪种条纹？宽的？细的？多彩的？我们需要为新的裤子系列选择合适的款式。

​​设计师:​​ 从经典的开始吧。细长、优雅的条纹。有一种优雅感。我们可以用在牛仔裤和更正式的裤子上。

​​助理:​​ 好主意。我们可以加点独特的元素。也许在口袋缝线上绣一个小珠宝图案？就用简单的串珠。

​​设计师:​​ 我喜欢这个主意！这是个细微之处，能让衣服变得特别。但这样会不会让牛仔裤太花哨，不适合日常穿？

​​助理:​​ 不一定。如果我们保持其他部分设计简洁，绣上去的珠宝就会成为迷人的焦点。它会吸引那些想要超越普通牛仔布的人。

​​设计师:​​ 没错。关键在于平衡。好了，我们打几个样品吧。我很期待看到条纹和刺绣结合的效果。

== The Department Store Dressing Room

​​Shopper A:​​ Okay, be honest. Do these trousers make me look... weird? The vertical stripe is so bold.

​​Shopper B:​​ Weird? No! They're fascinating! The stripe gives you a long, graceful line. It's very slimming.

​​Shopper A:​​ Really? You're not just saying that? I feel like a giant candy cane.

​​Shopper B:​​ (Laughs) A very stylish candy cane! The popularity of striped pants is insane right now. Everyone's wearing them. You'll fit right in.

​​Shopper A:​​ Hmm. Maybe. But look at the detail on these jeans. They have a little embroidered design on the back pocket. It's like a tiny jewel.

​​Shopper B:​​ Oh, I love that! It's a perfect touch. It's subtle but special. It's much more unique than just a plain string of stitches.

​​Shopper A:​​ You're right. Okay, you've convinced me. I'll get the striped trousers AND the jeans. My wallet is going to hate me.

​​Shopper B:​​ That's the spirit! Now, should we go look at cosmetics? I need new make-up. A look this stylish needs a perfect face to match!

百货商店试衣间

​​顾客A:​​ 好了，说实话。这条裤子让我看起来…奇怪吗？竖条纹太显眼了。

​​顾客B:​​ 奇怪？不！很迷人！条纹让你看起来修长、优雅。非常显瘦。

​​顾客A:​​ 真的吗？你不是在安慰我吧？我感觉自己像个巨大的糖果棒。

​​顾客B:​​ (笑) 非常时尚的糖果棒！条纹裤现在火得不行。人人在穿。你很合群。

​​顾客A:​​ 嗯。也许吧。但看这条牛仔裤的细节。后口袋上有个小刺绣图案。像个小珠宝。

​​顾客B:​​ 哦，我喜欢！画龙点睛。低调但特别。比普通的缝线独特多了。

​​顾客A:​​ 你说得对。好吧，你说服我了。我买这条条纹裤和这条牛仔裤。我的钱包要哭了。

​​顾客B:​​ 这就对了！现在，我们去看看化妆品吗？我需要新化妆品。这么时尚的装扮需要一张完美的脸来搭配！

== The Crafty Cousins

​​Cousin A:​​ I'm bored. What should we do? My popularity is at an all-time low today. No plans.

​​Cousin B:​​ Let's do something crafty! I have some old jeans we can upcycle. We can use this string and embroidery thread.

​​Cousin A:​​ Embroider jeans? That sounds... complicated. My sewing skills are not exactly graceful.

​​Cousin B:​​ It's easy! I'll show you. We can just sew a simple stripe down the side. Or maybe a little heart? It's fascinating to see plain fabric turn into something personal.

​​Cousin A:​​ Okay, that does sound kind of cool. Like adding a jewel to a crown. But what if I mess up the stitch?

​​Cousin B:​​ No worries! That's the beauty of it. If you don't like it, you just pull the string out. No harm done. It's not like permanent make-up!

​​Cousin A:​​ (Laughs) True! Okay, I'm in. But if these turn out ugly, you're wearing them to family dinner.

​​Cousin B:​​ Deal! This is going to be fun. Pass me the scissors. Let's create some wearable art!

手巧的表姐妹

​​表姐A:​​ 我好无聊。我们该做什么？我今天人气超低。没安排。

​​表姐B:​​ 我们做点手工吧！我有些旧牛仔裤可以改造。我们有线和绣花线。

​​表姐A:​​ 绣牛仔裤？听起来…好复杂。我的缝纫技术可不优雅。

​​表姐B:​​ 很简单的！我教你。我们可以就在裤腿侧边绣一条简单的条纹。或者绣个小爱心？看着普通的布料变成个性化的东西，多有趣啊。

​​表姐A:​​ 好吧，这听起来确实有点酷。就像给皇冠加颗宝石。但如果我缝错了怎么办？

​​表姐B:​​ 别担心！这就是它的美妙之处。如果你不喜欢，把线拆掉就行了。没损失。又不像永久性化妆！

​​表姐A:​​ (笑) 没错！好吧，我加入。但如果成品很丑，你得穿去家庭聚餐。

​​表姐B:​​ 成交！这会很有趣的。把剪刀递给我。我们来创造一些可穿戴的艺术品！
