== The Zoologist's Field Notes

Zoologist Ben: Okay, note this: the mammal's behaviour is fascinating. See the alpha wolf? It's the predator of this pack.

Intern Chloe: Got it. And its offspring, the cubs, are playing. They're learning defensive instincts. So cute!

Ben: "Cute" is not a scientific term, Chloe. They're developing skills for future subsistence. That play is functional. They'll need to prey on smaller creatures.

Chloe: Right. Sorry. Look, the mother is secreting milk to feed them. The whole pack helps raise the young. It's an intuitive system.

Ben: Exactly. Their social structure is highly flexible. Now, see the fox creeping at the edge of the woods? A potential threat. The wolves are sensitive to it.

Chloe: The wolf just let out a low bark. A warning. The fox is now a vulnerable victim if it gets closer. Nature is cruel sometimes.

Ben: It's not cruel. It's ecology. The wolf isn't being a brute; it's following its instinct to protect the brood. Let's track their movement. Try not to suffer a mosquito bite. Those pests are the real beasts here.

动物学家的野外笔记

动物学家 Ben: 好了，记下来：这种哺乳动物的行为很有趣。看到那头头狼了吗？它是这个狼群的捕食者。

实习生 Chloe: 明白。它的后代，那些幼崽，在玩耍。它们在习得防御本能。真可爱！

Ben: “可爱”不是科学术语，克洛伊。它们在培养未来生存的技能。那种玩耍是有功能的。它们需要捕食更小的生物。

Chloe: 对，抱歉。看，母狼在分泌乳汁喂养它们。整个狼群都帮助抚养幼崽。这是一个直觉性的系统。

Ben: 正是。它们的社会结构高度灵活。看，树林边缘潜行的那只狐狸？一个潜在的威胁。狼群对此很敏感。

Chloe: 那只狼发出了低沉的吠叫。一个警告。如果狐狸再靠近，它就会成为易受伤害的牺牲品。大自然有时很残酷。

Ben: 不是残酷。是生态学。狼不是野兽；它只是遵循保护幼崽的本能。我们追踪一下它们的行动。尽量别被蚊子咬。那些害虫才是这里真正的野兽。

== The Vet Clinic Chronicles

Vet Dr. Evans: So, this tortoise hasn't been eating. Its metabolism seems dormant. But it's not hibernation season.

Assistant: Could it be an epidemic? A virus or bacteria? We've seen several reptiles with similar symptoms.

Dr. Evans: Possibly. We need to run tests. Check for germs. Its shell seems sensitive to touch. It may be suffering.

Assistant: Poor thing. It's a captive breed, so it might be more vulnerable. Its anatomy is strong, but its immune system...

Dr. Evans: Let's not jump to conclusions. We need to examine its excretions. Also, ensure its cage is clean. We don't want parasites adding to the problem.

Assistant: Understood. I'll also check the vitamin content in its feed. Maybe it's a nutritional issue. A lack of protein.

Dr. Evans: Good thinking. Sometimes the cause is simpler than a microbe. Now, can you hand me the optical scope? I want a closer look.

兽医诊所纪事

兽医 Dr. Evans: 那么，这只乌龟一直不吃东西。它的新陈代谢似乎处于停滞状态。但现在不是冬眠季节。

助理: 会是流行病吗？病毒或细菌？我们见过好几只爬行动物有类似症状。

Dr. Evans: 有可能。需要做检查。查查病菌。它的壳似乎对触摸很敏感。它可能正忍受痛苦。

助理: 可怜的小东西。它是圈养繁殖的，所以可能更脆弱。它的解剖结构很强壮，但它的免疫系统…

Dr. Evans: 先别急着下结论。我们需要检查它的排泄物。还有，确保它的笼子干净。我们不希望有寄生虫让问题更严重。

助理: 明白。我还会检查一下它饲料里的维生素含量。也许是营养问题。缺乏蛋白质。

Dr. Evans: 想法不错。有时原因比微生物感染要简单。现在，能把光学放大镜递给我吗？我想仔细看看。

'''

== The Birdwatcher's Bicker

Enthusiast Anna: Look! A falcon! Such a magnificent bird of prey. Its optical abilities are incredible.

Skeptical Friend Tom: How can you tell it's a falcon and not a hawk or an eagle? They all have sharp beaks and claws.

Anna: By the shape of its wings! And its plumage! See how it soars? A hawk's flight is different. It's derived from its anatomy.

Tom: Looks like a bird to me. A pigeon with a better publicist. Is that a swallow over there? Or just a sparrow with ambition?

Anna: You're impossible. That's a crow. And it's not a pest; it's highly intelligent. Its acoustic signals are complex.

Tom: Sure, sure. "Caw caw" is very complex. Hey, is that a swan? It looks so graceful. I heard they can break a man's arm with their wing. A real brute in a feathered suit.

Anna: That's a myth! They're defensive if provoked. You have the instincts of a... a mosquito. Annoying and attracted to trouble.

Tom: I'll take that as a compliment. Mosquitoes are survivors. They've existed for millions of years. That's a successful species!

观鸟者的斗嘴

爱好者 Anna: 看！一只猎隼！多么威武的猛禽。它的光学能力太惊人了。

多疑的朋友 Tom: 你怎么知道是猎隼，不是鹰或雕？它们都有尖嘴和利爪。

Anna: 看它翅膀的形状！还有它的羽毛！看它翱翔的样子？鹰的飞行方式不同。这源于它们的解剖结构。

Tom: 我看着就是只鸟。一只公关做得更好的鸽子。那边那是只燕子吗？还是只胸怀大志的麻雀？

Anna: 你真是不可理喻。那是只乌鸦。而且它不是害虫；它非常聪明。它的声音信号很复杂。

Tom: 是，是。“呱呱”可真复杂。嘿，那是天鹅吗？看起来真优雅。我听说它们用翅膀就能打断人的胳膊。真是个穿着羽毛西装的野蛮家伙。

Anna: 那是谣传！它们只是在被激怒时有防御性。你的本能像只…蚊子。烦人还总惹麻烦。

Tom: 我就当这是夸奖了。蚊子是生存专家。它们已经存在了几百万年。那是成功的物种！

'''

== The Farmyard Follies

Old Farmer Joe: The cattle are restless. The bull in particular. We need to check the fence barrier. Don't want them breaking through.

City Slicker Nephew: Why not just use a harness? Or a saddle? Can you ride a bull? That would be cool!

Joe: Son, the only thing you'll ride on that bull is an ambulance. That beast weighs more than my barn. We use horses for riding. Or donkeys. They're more flexible.

Nephew: What about the sheep? Do they need a shepherd? I could be a shepherd! I have a very intuitive understanding of... fluff.

Joe: The flock has a shepherd. It's that dog. See it? It's herding the lambs. Its instinct is better than your "intuition" about fluff. Now, go check on the ox in the stable. And watch out for the goose. It's more cruel than the bull.

农家乐趣多

老农夫 Joe: 牛群有点躁动。特别是那头公牛。得检查一下篱笆屏障。可别让它们冲出来。

城里来的侄子: 为什么不用挽具？或者马鞍？能骑公牛吗？那肯定很酷！

Joe: 孩子，骑上那头公牛你唯一能坐的就是救护车。那野兽比我的谷仓还重。我们骑马。或者驴。它们更灵活。

Nephew: 那羊呢？它们需要牧羊人吗？我可以当牧羊人！我对…绒毛有非常直觉的理解。

Joe: 羊群有牧羊人。是那条狗。看到了吗？它在赶小羊羔。它的本能比你对绒毛的“直觉”强多了。去马厩看看那头阉牛。小心那只鹅。它比公牛还凶。

'''

== The Bug's Life (And Death)

Exterminator Max: Okay, the insect infestation originates in the hive behind the wall. We saw a swarm of them.

Homeowner Lisa: A swarm? I thought it was just a few pests! What kind? Spiders? Mosquitoes?

Max: Worse. Crickets. And they're proliferating fast. They lay eggs everywhere. They'll soon hatch. We need to exterminate them before the problem undergoes a massive increase.

Lisa: But isn't that cruel? They're just creatures trying to exist. Can't we just... tame them? Be their keeper?

Max: Ma'am, this isn't a Disney film. These are parasites that will devour your woolens. Their instinct is to eat and breed. They don't have the intelligence for a peace treaty. My job is to trace the source and solve it.

Lisa: Fine. But be... defensive about it. Only target the crickets. The spider in the corner is called Steve. He's on our side.

虫虫特工队（生死之间）

灭虫员 Max: 好了，虫害源于墙后面的巢穴。我们看到一大群。

房主 Lisa: 一大群？我以为只有几只害虫！什么虫？蜘蛛？蚊子？

Max: 更糟。蟋蟀。而且它们繁殖得很快。到处产卵。很快就要孵化了。我们需要在问题大规模爆发之前消灭它们。

Lisa: 但那不残忍吗？它们只是试图生存的生物。我们不能…驯养它们吗？当它们的饲养员？

Max: 女士，这不是迪士尼电影。这些是寄生虫，会啃坏你的羊毛制品。它们的本能就是吃和繁殖。它们没有签和平条约的智商。我的工作是追踪源头并解决它。

Lisa: 好吧。但是要…有针对性。只针对蟋蟀。角落里那只蜘蛛叫史蒂夫。它是我们这边的。

'''

== The Marine Biologist's Mix-up

Marine Biologist Dr. Reed: The whale population is undergoing a strange change. Their acoustic communication patterns are alternating.

Colleague: Could it be related to their prey? Maybe the fish species they devour are declining. It affects their subsistence.

Dr. Reed: Perhaps. We need to study the flora and fauna of their habitat. The entire ecosystem might be suffering. See the seal over there? Its fur looks dull. Might be a lack of vitamin intake.

Colleague: Or a germ. An epidemic among marine mammals is a real threat. They're vulnerable to viruses we don't even know about.

Dr. Reed: True. We have a potential crisis. We must act before we see a die-off. Let's track the pod. We can't let these magnificent creatures become victims of our ignorance.

Colleague: Agreed. I'll get the boat ready. And hope that penguin doesn't steal my lunch again. That bird is a cunning predator of sandwiches.

海洋生物学家的混乱

海洋生物学家 Dr. Reed: 鲸鱼种群正在经历奇怪的变化。它们的声波通讯模式在改变。

同事: 这和它们的猎物有关吗？也许它们捕食的鱼类正在减少。影响了它们的生存。

Dr. Reed: 有可能。我们需要研究它们栖息地的动植物群。整个生态系统可能都在遭受痛苦。看那边那只海豹？它的毛看起来暗淡无光。可能是维生素摄入不足。

同事: 或者是病菌。海洋哺乳动物中的流行病是个真正的威胁。它们对我们甚至不了解的病毒都很脆弱。

Dr. Reed: 没错。我们可能面临危机。必须在出现大量死亡前采取行动。我们追踪那个鲸群。不能让这些美丽的生物成为我们无知的牺牲品。

同事: 同意。我去准备船。希望那只企鹅别再偷我的午餐了。那鸟是个狡猾的三明治捕食者。

'''

== The Mythical Creature Debate

Nerd 1: So, a dragon. If it existed, what would its metabolism be like? It breathes fire. That must secrete something special.

Nerd 2: Probably a highly volatile protein. And its skin would need to be thick, like a reptile's, to withstand the heat. It's a fascinating anatomical potential.

Nerd 1: Right! And its wings? Would they be like a bat's, or more like a bird's with feathers and plumes? Functional or for courtship display?

Nerd 2: Why not both? Flexible design. But the real question is: is it a carnivore? Does it prey on knights and devour cattle? Or is it an herbivore, living off... magical flora?

Nerd 1: I think it's an instinctive predator. But maybe it could be tame. With the right keeper. Imagine riding a dragon! Better than a horse with a saddle!

Nerd 2: Dude, you've been reading too many fantasy books. Next you'll say you're a descendant of a dragon. Go outside. Look at a squirrel. It's more your speed.

神秘生物辩论会

书呆子 1: 那么，龙。如果它存在，它的新陈代谢会怎样？它喷火。那肯定分泌某种特殊物质。

书呆子 2: 可能是一种高度易挥发的蛋白质。它的皮肤需要很厚，像爬行动物，以承受高温。这解剖结构潜力巨大，很有趣。

书呆子 1: 对！它的翅膀呢？像蝙蝠的，还是更像鸟的，有羽毛？功能性还是用于求偶展示？

书呆子 2: 为什么不能兼有？灵活的设计。但真正的问题是：它是食肉动物吗？捕食骑士，吞噬牛羊？还是食草动物，靠…魔法植物为生？

书呆子 1: 我觉得它是本能捕食者。但也许能被驯服。只要有合适的饲养员。想象一下骑龙！比骑马配鞍强多了！

书呆子 2: 哥们，你奇幻书看太多了。接下来你该说自己是龙的后裔了。出去走走。看看松鼠。那才适合你的节奏。

'''

== The City Zoo Confusion

Visitor 1: Look, the panda! A bear that's basically an herbivore. It devours bamboo all day.

Visitor 2: And over there, the camel! Did you know its ancestor originated in North America? Its subspecies adapted to arid lands.

Visitor 1: Really? Now, the kangaroo is a marsupial, not a primate. And the zebra... is it a horse with a paint job? Can they interbreed?

Zookeeper: (Overhearing) No, they cannot. They're different species. Hybridisation is rare and often leads to sterility. Please don't throw food over the barrier. That diet is inappropriate for an amphibian like that frog.

Visitor 2: Sorry! Hey, is that an African or Asian elephant? How can you tell?

Zookeeper: Look at the ears. And the trunk. Also, the ivory tusks are longer on the... oh, this one doesn't have tusks. A policy to protect them from poachers. A cruel practice.

Visitor 1: Understandable. This place has a great diversity of fauna. From the tiny insect to the giant mammal. Even a turtle and a tortoise! What's the difference again?

Zookeeper: Turtles mostly live in water, tortoises on land. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to check on the nocturnal house. The owl and the hare are probably awake.

城市动物园疑惑

游客 1: 看，熊猫！一种基本是食草动物的熊。它整天啃竹子。

游客 2: 那边，骆驼！你知道它的祖先起源于北美吗？它的亚种适应了干旱地带。

游客 1: 真的吗？看，袋鼠是有袋动物，不是灵长类动物。斑马…是刷了漆的马吗？它们能杂交吗？

动物园管理员: （无意中听到）不能，它们是不同物种。杂交很罕见，而且常导致不育。请不要越过栏杆投喂。那种饮食不适合像青蛙这样的两栖动物。

游客 2: 抱歉！嘿，那是非洲象还是亚洲象？怎么区分？

动物园管理员: 看耳朵。还有鼻子。另外，象牙更长在…哦，这只没有象牙。是为了保护它们免受偷猎者伤害的政策。一种残酷的行为。

游客 1: 可以理解。这个地方的动物群多样性真好。从小昆虫到大型哺乳动物。还有海龟和陆龟！区别是什么来着？

动物园管理员: 海龟主要生活在水里，陆龟在陆地上。失陪了，我得去看看夜行动物馆。猫头鹰和野兔大概醒了。

'''

== The Garden Pest Patrol

Gardener 1: This butterfly is beautiful, but its caterpillar stage is a pest. It will devour these leaves.

Gardener 2: True. But we can't exterminate them all. They're part of the flora and fauna. We need a defensive strategy, not a destructive one. Maybe a natural parasite?

Gardener 1: Perhaps. Look at the hive on that branch. The bees are sensitive to disturbance. Their sting is a powerful defense. They secrete wax to build the honeycomb cells.

Gardener 2: Amazing creatures. Their social behaviour is complex. Not like that solitary spider spinning its web. Different survival instincts.

Gardener 1: Exactly. Now, help me trace the source of this mould. It stems from too much moisture. These plants are vulnerable to fungus.

Gardener 2: I'll rub this organic fungicide on the stems. We need to be flexible in our approach. Every species, from the smallest microbe to the tallest tree, has its role. Even the weeds.

Gardener 1: Speaking of which, did you see the size of that throng of mosquitoes by the pond? It's an epidemic waiting to happen!

花园害虫巡逻队

园丁 1: 这蝴蝶很漂亮，但它的毛毛虫阶段是害虫。会啃光这些叶子。

园丁 2: 没错。但不能全消灭。它们是动植物群的一部分。我们需要防御性策略，不是破坏性的。也许用天然寄生虫？

园丁 1: 可能吧。看那树枝上的蜂巢。蜜蜂对干扰很敏感。它们的蜇刺是强大的防御。它们分泌蜡来建造蜂巢。

园丁 2: 神奇的生物。它们的社会行为很复杂。不像那只独自织网的蜘蛛。不同的生存本能。

园丁 1: 正是。现在，帮我查查这霉菌的源头。源于太潮湿。这些植物容易感染真菌。

园丁 2: 我会在茎上擦点有机杀菌剂。我们的方法要灵活。每个物种，从最小的微生物到最高的树，都有其作用。甚至杂草也是。

园丁 1: 说到这个，你看到池塘边那一大群蚊子的规模了吗？简直是等着爆发的流行病！

== The Geneticist's Lunch Break

Geneticist Anna: So, this tomato. Its genes have been modified for better yield. See the difference in its skin? It's thicker.

Colleague Ben: Yeah, but at what cost? The natural variation is being lost. Soon we'll have one tomato to rule them all. Its ancestor would be shocked.

Anna: That's a bit dramatic. We're just selecting for favourable traits. Better protein content, more vitamins. It's about functional food security.

Ben: But what about the potential unintended consequences? Could it hybridise with wild plants? Affect other species' subsistence? We're playing with the very blueprint of life!

Anna: Life is flexible, Ben. And we're careful. We track every change at the gene level. It's not like we're creating a dragon with optical camouflage and acoustic weapons.

Ben: Not yet. But give it time. Pass the salt. This tomato tastes... sterile. Like it's missing its soul.

Anna: It's missing basil. Here. A leaf from my plant. Now it has a soul. And a better scent.

遗传学家的午餐时间

遗传学家 Anna: 看这个番茄。它的基因被改良了，为了提高产量。看到表皮的差异了吗？更厚了。

同事 Ben: 是啊，但是代价呢？自然变异正在丢失。很快我们就只有一种番茄一统天下了。它的祖先会震惊的。

Anna: 太夸张了。我们只是在选择有利性状。更好的蛋白质含量，更多的维生素。这是为了功能性食品安全。

Ben: 但潜在的意外后果呢？它会和野生植物杂交吗？影响其他物种的生存？我们在玩弄生命的蓝图！

Anna: 生命是灵活的，本。而且我们很小心。我们在基因层面追踪每一个变化。又不是在制造有光学迷彩和声波武器的龙。

Ben: 还没到时候。假以时日罢了。把盐递给我。这番茄尝起来…像消毒过的。像丢了魂儿。

Anna: 是少了罗勒。给。我种的叶子。现在它有魂儿了。气味也更好闻了。

'''

== The Backyard Safari

Lily: Check out this insect! It's got these weird bristles on its back. And look how it curls up when I touch it.

Ben: Cool! Is it a worm? No, it's got legs. It must be some kind of immature insect. A larva.

Lily: Right. It'll mature into... something. Maybe a beetle? There's a whole wildlife crowd under this log. Worms, bugs... it's like a mini city.

Ben: A city with a serious waste management problem. What do they all excrete? Actually, don't answer that. Hey, look! A mouse! A vertebrate! Much more exciting than bugs.

Lily: It's so small! Watch it crawl through the hedge. Its little paws are a blur. Okay, maybe mammals are more cute. But insects are the real rulers of the world.

Ben: Says the girl who screamed at a spider yesterday. Such a brave ecologist.

后院探险

Lily: 快看这只虫子！它背上有这些奇怪的刚毛。看，我碰它的时候它蜷缩起来了。

Ben: 酷！是蠕虫吗？不，它有腿。肯定是某种未成熟的昆虫。幼虫。

Lily: 对。它会成熟变成…某种东西。可能是甲虫？这根木头下面简直是个野生动物群。蠕虫、虫子…像个迷你城市。

Ben: 一个有着严重垃圾处理问题的城市。它们都排泄什么？算了，别回答。嘿，看！一只老鼠！脊椎动物！比虫子刺激多了。

Lily: 好小啊！看它在树篱下爬行。它的小爪子快得看不清。好吧，也许哺乳动物更可爱。但昆虫才是世界真正的统治者。

Ben: 这话是昨天被蜘蛛吓得尖叫的人说的。好勇敢的生态学家啊。

== The City Zoo Debacle

Mom: Kids, look! The buffalo! And see the little one? That's a calf.

Child: It's huge! Does it have a horn? I see one! Is it a subgroup of the cow species?

Mom: Well, they're related. But look over there! The wolf enclosure. The adult is just lying there, but the pup is so playful!

Child: I want to hear it roar! Can it roar? Or does it just bark? Wait, what's that noise?

Announcer: (Over loudspeaker) Attention visitors. The male peacock, or cock, has escaped its enclosure. Please do not approach. It may be nesting. If you see it, alert a staff member.

Child: A peacock on the loose! This is the best day ever! Way more exciting than that rat in the small mammal house.

Mom: This was not on the brochure. Next time, we're going to the botanical gardens. At least the plants stay in one place.

动物园乌龙事件

Mom: 孩子们，看！野牛！看到那只小的了吗？那是小牛犊。

Child: 好大啊！它有角吗？我看到一个！它是牛物种的一个亚组吗？

Mom: 嗯，它们有亲缘关系。但看那边！狼舍。成年狼就在那儿躺着，但幼狼真好玩！

Child: 我想听它吼叫！它会吼吗？还是只汪汪叫？等等，什么声音？

Announcer: (广播) 各位游客请注意。雄性孔雀从围栏里逃出来了。请勿靠近。它可能正在筑巢。如果看到，请通知工作人员。

Child: 孔雀跑出来了！今天太棒了！比小哺乳动物馆里的老鼠刺激多了。

Mom: 宣传册上可没写这个。下次我们去植物园。至少植物会待在原地。

== The Unlikely Fishermen

Jake: I'm telling you, this is the spot. The fish spawn in this part of the river. We're gonna catch a massive one.

Sam: A massive worm, maybe. This is boring. We've been here for hours. Not even a bite. What kind of fish has fins but no brains?

Jake: They're not dumb. They're just... cautious. They have a sixth sense for amateurs like you. You scare them with your... vibe.

Sam: My vibe? My vibe is hungry. I should have mated with the idea of getting pizza instead. That was a mature and sensible plan.

Jake: Shhh! Look! See that ripple? A big one. A vertebrate of considerable size. This is it!

Sam: It's a plastic bag, Jake. You just got excited about a drifting plastic bag. I'm done. I'm going to the bar. They have fish there too. In batter.

不像渔夫的渔夫

Jake: 跟你说，就是这地方。鱼在这段河里产卵。我们准能钓条大的。

Sam: 大的蠕虫还差不多。真无聊。我们在这儿呆了几小时了。连咬钩的都没有。什么鱼有鱼鳍却没脑子？

Jake: 它们不傻。只是…谨慎。它们对像你这样的菜鸟有第六感。你的…气场吓着它们了。

Sam: 我的气场？我的气场是饿。我当初真该认同去吃披萨的想法。那才是个成熟理智的计划。

Jake: 嘘！看！那涟漪看见没？个儿不小。一条体型相当大的脊椎动物。就是它了！

Sam: 是个塑料袋，杰克。你刚刚为个漂流的塑料袋兴奋不已。我不干了。我去酒吧了。那儿也有鱼。裹着面糊的。

== The Awkward Birdwatchers

Amateur 1: According to this book, this time of year is when many bird species mate. They perform courtship dances.

Amateur 2: Fascinating. So that pigeon trying to mount that other pigeon... that's not a fight? That's romance? It's a bit... direct.

Amateur 1: Well, nature isn't always subtle. Look, a crow! It's building a nest in that tree. See it carrying that twig?

Amateur 2: I see it. It's also being dive-bombed by a sparrow. Not very welcoming. The wildlife in this park is brutal.

Amateur 1: It's just defensive of its territory. Oh, wow! A hawk! Look at it soar! A true predator.

Amateur 2: Yeah, a predator who just stole that other bird's lunch. This is like a soap opera. With more worms. And feathers.

尴尬的观鸟者

Amateur 1: 根据这本书，每年这个时候是许多鸟类物种交配的季节。它们会跳求偶舞。

Amateur 2: 真有趣。所以那只想骑到另一只鸽子身上的鸽子…不是在打架？是浪漫？有点…直接。

Amateur 1: 嗯，大自然不总是含蓄的。看，乌鸦！它在那棵树上筑巢呢。看到它叼树枝了吗？

Amateur 2: 看到了。它正被一只麻雀俯冲轰炸。不太友好啊。这公园的野生动物真野蛮。

Amateur 1: 只是在保护自己的领地。哦，哇！一只鹰！看它翱翔！真正的捕食者。

Amateur 2: 是啊，一个刚抢了别的鸟午餐的捕食者。这就像肥皂剧。就是虫子多了点。还有羽毛。

== The Pond Life Investigators

Ella: I'm telling you, that's a frog. See? It's an amphibian. It will lay its eggs in the water soon. They'll spawn into tadpoles.

Ben: Okay, Ms. Botanist. How do you know it's not a toad? And what's that other thing? A newt? The diversity of vertebrate life in this pond is impressive.

Ella: I'm an ecologist, not a botanist. Botanists study flora. I study fauna. Like this frog. And that dragonfly larva. Look at it crawl.

Ben: It's kind of ugly. But cool. This whole area is a great place for wildlife to mate and raise their young. Much better than that dirty city river full of rats.

Ella: Absolutely. It's a delicate ecosystem. Every species, from the smallest worm to the largest... well, there are no buffalo here... but everything has a role.

Ben: Even that mosquito that just bit me? Its role is to be a pest. I vote we introduce a subgroup of frogs that only eat mosquitoes.

Ella: If only it were that simple. Nature doesn't work that way. Now, be quiet. I think I see a water snake. A real live predator!

池塘生物调查员

Ella: 跟你说，那是青蛙。看？是两栖动物。它很快会在水里产卵。会孵化成蝌蚪。

Ben: 好的，植物学家小姐。你怎么知道不是蟾蜍？那另一个东西是什么？蝾螈？这个池塘里脊椎动物生命的多样性真令人印象深刻。

Ella: 我是生态学家，不是植物学家。植物学家研究植物群。我研究动物群。比如这只青蛙。还有那只蜻蜓幼虫。看它爬。

Ben: 有点丑。但很酷。这整个区域是野生动物交配和抚育后代的绝佳场所。比那条满是老鼠的肮脏城市河流好多了。

Ella: 绝对是的。这是个脆弱的生态系统。每个物种，从最小的蠕虫到最大的…嗯，这儿没野牛…但都有其作用。

Ben: 包括刚咬我的那只蚊子？它的作用就是当害虫。我提议引入一个只吃蚊子的青蛙亚群。

Ella: 要是那么简单就好了。大自然不那样运作。现在，安静。我想我看到一条水蛇。一个真正的活捕食者！
