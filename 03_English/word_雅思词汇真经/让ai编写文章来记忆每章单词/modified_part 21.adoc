== The Doctor's Consultation

​​Doctor:​​ Good morning. I understand you haven't been feeling well. Can you describe the physical symptoms? Any pain in your chest, abdomen, or joints?

​​Patient:​​ It's more than physical, Doctor. My mood has been low, my emotions are all over the place. I've lost my temper easily, which is not in my character. I'm usually a very calm person.

​​Doctor:​​ I see. The mind and body are deeply connected. Stress can affect your hormones, your immune system, even your biorhythm. Let's check your vitals. I need to feel your pulse and check your glands. Any pain here, near the liver or stomach?

​​Patient:​​ A bit, yes. And my knee joint has been aching. My lifestyle hasn't been great lately—poor diet, bad habits. I know I need to change my attitude towards health.

​​Doctor:​​ Well, acknowledging that is the first step. Your stature and general physique look good. But let's run some tests on your blood, check your kidneys and lungs. We need a complete view of your health. The human body is a complex system; an issue in one organ, like the womb or intestine, can cause problems elsewhere.

​​Patient:​​ Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your manner. You have a good bedside trait.

​​Doctor:​​ It's my virtue to help. Now, open your mouth wide, let me see your throat and tongue. Say 'ahh'...

== The Anatomy Class Debate

​​Professor:​​ Today, we'll discuss the feature that truly sets mankind apart: the human brain. This organ, protected by the skull, is the seat of the mind.

​​Student A:​​ But Professor, isn't it the complex nervous system? The nerves, the spinal cord protected by the backbone... without them, the brain is just tissue.

​​Student B:​​ I think it's the opposable thumb! It allowed us to use tools, which stimulated our brain development. It's a feedback loop. The physical stimulus led to mental growth.

​​Professor:​​ Excellent points! It's the integration of systems. Think about the signal from your eye, through the optic nerve, to the visual cortex. Your sight creates your view of the world. Or the sense of touch on your palm or fingertip. Every part, from the largest limb to the smallest pore, plays a role.

​​Student A:​​ So, our entire physical form, from the forehead to the toe, contributes to our consciousness? Even the hormones from our glands influence our mood and emotions?

​​Professor:​​ Precisely! Your stomach growling can affect your temper. A hormone released from your kidney can influence your energy level. It's all connected. There's no separating the mental from the physical. It's the core of human biology.

== The Yoga and Meditation Session

​​Instructor:​​ Welcome, everyone. Find a comfortable seat, lengthen your spine, relax your jaw and your shoulders. Close your eyes and bring your awareness to your breath. Feel the air moving over your lips, filling your lungs.

​​Student:​​ (Whispers) My mind is racing. I can't calm down. My pulse feels fast.

​​Instructor:​​ That's okay. Just observe the feeling, the emotion, without judgment. Notice the physical sensations—perhaps in your chest or your abdomen. Breathe into them. This practice helps regulate your biorhythm and can boost your immune system.

​​Student:​​ I'll try. I'm focusing on the sense of my palms on my knees.

​​Instructor:​​ Good. Now, as we move into a forward fold, hinge from the waist, not the spine. Feel the stretch in the back of your thighs, your hamstrings. This stimulates the nerves and can improve your mood.

​​Student:​​ Wow, I can feel it all the way to my heel! My whole attitude is shifting. This is a great habit to develop for my lifestyle.

​​Instructor:​​ Exactly. It's about connecting mind and body. Now, gently roll up, vertebra by vertebra. Bring your thumb and forefinger together. Open your eyes. How's the view from here?

== The Artist's Model

​​Artist:​​ Hold that pose, please. The light on your neck and shoulder is perfect. The line from your elbow to your wrist is exquisite. Don't tense the muscle.

​​Model:​​ It's harder than it looks. My thigh is starting to shake. And I'm trying not to blink and lose my eyelash placement!

​​Artist:​​ (Chuckles) Think of something calming. Tap into an emotion—serenity, perhaps. Let it show in your face, in the set of your jaw, the relaxation of your brow. The character I'm trying to capture has a strong but gentle personality.

​​Model:​​ I'm focusing on the sense of my breath going down my throat. It helps. But my big toe is going numb!

​​Artist:​​ Almost done. The human form is a marvel—the curve of the rib cage, the delicate bones of the finger. It's all flesh and blood, but it contains the entire human experience. Okay, relax! You can move your limbs. Thank you; that was a great view.

​​Model:​​ Phew! My knee joints are stiff. But it's fascinating to be part of creating art. It gives you a new view of your own body.

== The Emergency Room

​​Paramedic:​​ We have a male, late 20s. Found unconscious. Possible head trauma. We need to check his pupils and his brain function.

​​Nurse:​​ Got it. Let's log his vitals—pulse, check his airway. Is there any obstruction in the throat? Look at his tongue.

​​Doctor:​​ (Examining) There's a contusion on the forehead. We need a full skull and spine X-ray. Check for fractures. The skeleton took a impact. I need to check his liver and kidney function too. There could be internal bleeding in the abdomen.

​​Paramedic:​​ His limb movement is limited on the right side. Could be nerve damage from the backbone.

​​Nurse:​​ His blood pressure is dropping. We need to support his organs. Start an IV. We need to keep his pulse stable. This is a fight for his life. His entire system is under stimulus.

​​Doctor:​​ Let's move him to the chamber for a CT scan. We need a view of his brain, now! Every second counts. Mankind's medical knowledge is his only hope right now.

== The Boxing Gym Physical

​​Trainer:​​ Okay, champ, let's check your form. Keep your fists up, protect your cheeks and jaw. A punch to the chin can knock you out, but a shot to the throat or gorge can be serious.

​​Boxer:​​ Got it. I'm trying to improve my footwork. Pivoting on the ball of my foot, but my ankle feels weak sometimes.

​​Trainer:​​ That's a common issue. Strengthen those muscles. Remember, power comes from the legs, through the waist, into the shoulder. It's a kinetic chain. Now, let's check your eyesight. Can you see the punches coming? Good sight is crucial.

​​Boxer:​​ My eyesight is 20/20. But when I get tired, my reaction time slows. I need better stamina.

​​Trainer:​​ That's about lifestyle and habit. Your biorhythm needs to be optimized. Get enough rest. Your body needs time to repair muscle and nerve tissue. Also, watch your diet—clogged arteries will kill your stamina. You need good blood flow.

​​Boxer:​​ Speaking of blood flow... I got a cut above my eye last sparring session. Right on the eyebrow. Luckily, it missed the artery.

​​Trainer:​​ Yeah, that was close. Sit on the mat, take a lap. Let's work on some defensive drills. It's not just about physical power; it's a mental game. Your attitude in the ring is everything.

== The Emergency Room Triage

​​Nurse:​​ Okay, what seems to be the problem?

​​Patient:​​ I feel dizzy and faint. I have a terrible headache, and my ankle is swollen. I think I might have broken it. I'm in a lot of pain.

​​Nurse:​​ Any visible injury? Bleeding? Let me check your pulse. You look pale and weary. Have you been overworking yourself? Fatigue can weaken the immune system.

​​Patient:​​ Yes, I've been exhausted. I had a bit of a fall. I choked on my water and then stumbled. Now I have this lump on my head. I feel uncomfortable and a bit nauseous.

​​Nurse:​​ We need to check for a concussion. Head trauma is nothing to vague about. It could be fatal if untreated. Let's get you to a room. Doctor! We have a patient with a potential head injury, feeling dizzy and faint!

== The Wellness Clinic Consultation

​​Doctor:​​ Your blood pressure is quite high. We need to talk about your hypertension. Combined with your obesity, it puts you at serious risk for a heart attack or a stroke.

​​Patient:​​ I know I'm overweight. I have this back pain that makes exercise uncomfortable. I'm tired all the time—just feeble and weary.

​​Doctor:​​ Chronic pain and fatigue are common symptoms. We should test for diabetes and arthritis. Your body is under constant stress. This lifestyle is a detriment to your health. It's not just uncomfortable; it's a path to becoming disabled.

​​Patient:​​ It sounds doom-laden. Is it fatal?

​​Doctor:​​ Not if we act. We can manage these conditions. The goal is to prevent a fatal event. You're not an invalid yet. But we need to address the root cause, not just the symptoms.

== The Late-Night Pharmacy

​​Pharmacist:​​ You look like you haven't slept in days.

​​Customer:​​ Insomnia. I'm awake all night, then I yawn all day. I'm so exhausted I feel like I might faint. I tried to take a nap, but I just dozed off for a minute then was wide awake again.

​​Customer's Friend:​​ He's driving me insane! And he's getting these weird allergies or something. Maybe it's the flu? He had a fever last week.

​​Customer:​​ It wasn't the flu, it was just a headache and my glands were swollen. But now I have this rash—like pimples. It's not visible unless you look close, but it hurts.

​​Pharmacist:​​ Stress can cause all sorts of physical symptoms. Insomnia can make you dizzy and weaken your system. You need to treat the cause, not just the symptoms. Here's something to help you sleep, but you should see a doctor about that rash. It could be an infection.

== The Support Group Meeting

​​Facilitator:​​ Welcome, everyone. We're here to share our experiences with chronic illness. It's a safe space.

​​Member A:​​ My arthritis makes me feel crippled some days. The pain is like a constant dull trauma. I'm not lame, but I feel disabled by it.

​​Member B:​​ I understand. After my stroke, my left side was paralysed. I felt like my life was over. The doom was overwhelming. I was sure it was fatal.

​​Member C:​​ For me, it's the mental toll. The cancer treatment left me feeble. The disease itself, the constant fear of demise... it's a different kind of pain. Sometimes I wish I could be unconscious just to escape it.

​​Facilitator:​​ These feelings are valid. The trauma of a serious diagnosis is real. But you are all survivors. Your strength is visible in your presence here today.

== The Dramatic Diagnosis

​​Doctor:​​ I'm afraid the news isn't good. The lump we biopsied... it's cancer.

​​Patient:​​ (Gasps) Cancer? But... I feel fine! A little tired, maybe weary, but...

​​Doctor:​​ That's the insidious thing about this disease. The symptoms can be vague until it's advanced. The fatigue, the unexplained pain... your body has been fighting an invisible infection.

​​Patient:​​ Is it... fatal? My demise? Oh god, I'm going to be sick...

​​Doctor:​​ Please, try to stay calm. It's not a death sentence. Many cancers are treatable now. But we need to act fast. The tumour is lethal if we let it grow.

​​Patient:​​ (Starts to moan) I'm too young! I haven't even... I wanted to have a child, a pregnancy... now I'm doomed!

​​Doctor:​​ Let's not leap to the worst-case scenario. Modern medicine has come a long way. You are not doomed. You are a patient, and we will fight this together.

== The Post-Accident Recovery

​​Physiotherapist:​​ How's the pain today? On a scale from vague discomfort to unbearable?

​​Patient:​​ The wound itself is healing, but the muscle around it is still swollen and hurts. The injury has left me feeling feeble. Just getting out of bed is exhausting.

​​Physiotherapist:​​ That's normal after a trauma. The body needs time. The scar tissue will form, and the bruise will fade. But we need to work on strengthening the area so it doesn't become a chronic dysfunction.

​​Patient:​​ I just feel so... invalid. I can't do anything without getting dizzy and tired. I overworked myself just making tea yesterday and almost fainted.

​​Physiotherapist:​​ Pushing too hard can be a detriment. Your energy is finite. It's like your battery is weakened. We need to recharge it slowly, not drain it completely. Let's try some gentle exercises. The goal is to make you feel less uncomfortable and more in control.

== The Historical Pandemic Discussion

​​Historian:​​ The Black Death wasn't just a disease; it was a plague that reshaped society. The symptom was often a high fever, followed by painful swellings in the groin or armpits—the infamous buboes.

​​Student:​​ It sounds like a lethal and fatal nightmare. Was there any treatment?

​​Historian:​​ None that worked. Medicine was blind to the cause. They thought it was spread through 'bad air'. The mortality rate was staggering. It doomed entire communities.

​​Student:​​ So it was a viral infection? Like the flu?

​​Historian:​​ Actually, we now know it was a bacterial infection spread by fleas. But the effect was similar to a pandemic flu: overwhelming the population, causing mass death and trauma. It left the survivors weary and the social fabric broken.

== The Sensory Deprivation Experiment Debrief

​​Scientist A:​​ The subject's visual and aural inputs were completely blocked. He was in a quiet, dark room for 48 hours.

​​Scientist B:​​ And the results? Did he fall asleep?

​​Scientist A:​​ Not for the first day. He reported vivid visual hallucinations—his brain was creating its own stimuli. When he did fall asleep, his dreams were so intense they felt more real than being awake. He felt like a mortal trapped in an immortal's nightmare.

​​Scientist B:​​ What about the physical corpus? Any changes?

​​Scientist A:​​ He became hypersensitive. The slightest touch felt like a shock. He described a vague pain in his jaw, like a dental problem, but there was nothing physically wrong. It was psychosomatic.

​​Scientist B:​​ It's as if the body, when deprived of external data, turns its focus inward, amplifying every minor dysfunction. It doesn't just weaken the mind; it can make you feel physically ill. The data from this experiment will dwarf our previous findings.

​​Scientist A:​​ Absolutely. It's a clone of the classic sensory deprivation studies, but with modern monitoring. We're not blind to the ethical concerns, but the knowledge gained is immense.

== The Awkward Health Class

​​Teacher:​​ Today we're discussing reproductive health. Using a condom correctly is crucial to prevent infection and unwanted pregnancy.

​​Student A:​​ (Whispering) This is so uncomfortable. I feel dumb. Why are we learning this?

​​Student B:​​ Because it's important! You weren't born knowing it. It's better than the alternative—a disease that could disable you or worse.

​​Teacher:​​ Exactly. These are not vague threats; they are mortal dangers. The human body is not a clone; each person is unique and vulnerable. Protecting it is a responsibility that dwarfs any momentary awkwardness. Now, who can tell me the most common symptom of a certain STI?

​​Student A:​​ (Quietly) I think I'll just pretend to be asleep.

​​Student B:​​ Don't be dumb. It's just a body. We all have one.

== The Chronic Pain Management Clinic

​​Physician:​​ Good morning. I understand you're here for your chronic back pain. Let's review your treatment plan.

​​Patient:​​ Yes, it's an acute issue today. The soreness is unbearable. I'm suffering greatly. I've tried everything – painkillers, acupuncture, even morphine injections for temporary relief. But the pain always returns.

​​Physician:​​ I see. The usual remedies haven't provided a satisfactory long-term cure. We need a more holistic approach. This isn't just a medical issue; it's affecting your mental health. Your passive attitude towards therapy is negligible for recovery. We need you to be an active, enthusiastic participant.

​​Patient:​​ It's hard to be positive when you're in constant sorrow. I lament the life I've lost to this pain.

​​Physician:​​ I understand. But being pessimistic won't heal you. Let's resume your physical therapy with a fresh perspective. The goal is to alleviate the pain, ease your suffering, and help you return to a normal life. This is a common challenge, but recovery is desirable and achievable. A positive outlook can be a powerful medicine in itself.

== The Post-Op Check-up

​​Surgeon:​​ The operation was a success. The transplant is functioning well. Your X-rays look positive.

​​Patient:​​ That's a huge relief! I'm so delighted. When can I resume my usual activities?

​​Surgeon:​​ Slowly. You need time to heal completely. No heavy lifting. Take your prescriptions – the antibiotics are crucial to prevent infection. Follow all sanitary precautions. Your recovery is going well, but we must be cautious. We need to segregate you from anyone with a cold for a few more weeks. We can't risk an infection.

​​Patient:​​ I agree. I'm thrilled with the progress. It's so agreeable to hear good news. This whole experience has been so exciting, in a strange way. A second chance at life!

​​Surgeon:​​ (Chuckles) That's an optimistic way to see it. Just remember, the medicine is working, but your body does the healing. Keep a positive attitude. Get plenty of rest to refresh your system. You'll be back to your merry self in no time.

== The Pharmacy Consultation

​​Pharmacist:​​ Here's your prescription. This medicine should help alleviate the symptoms. Take one pill with food twice daily.

​​Customer:​​ Thank you. Is this a common drug? Any negative side effects?

​​Pharmacist:​​ It's very usual for this condition. Side effects are generally negligible – maybe some drowsiness. It's not a cure, but it will provide relief and ease the discomfort while your body heals. It's a desirable first step.

​​Customer:​​ I hope so. I need to get back to work. I can't be indifferent to my health, but I also can't afford to be passive for too long.

​​Pharmacist:​​ I understand. Just follow the treatment. If the pain becomes acute again, come back for a check. We also have some excellent over-the-counter remedies here at the pharmacy if you need additional relief. The key is to be positive; happiness aids recovery.

== The Travel Health Clinic

​​Nurse:​​ Before you travel, we recommend several vaccinations as a precaution. It's a key part of sanitary travel.

​​Traveler:​​ I'm a bit apathetic about shots, to be honest. They're not exactly fun. But I suppose it's desirable to avoid getting sick on holiday.

​​Nurse:​​ It's more than desirable; it's essential for your health care. Some diseases common abroad can cause acute suffering. A simple injection can prevent weeks of sorrow. We also have medicine for travelers' diarrhea—a very usual issue.

​​Traveler:​​ Okay, you've convinced me. The thrill of travel shouldn't include a hospital visit! I'm enthusiastic about going, so I should be positive about preparing. Let's do it.

​​Nurse:​​ Excellent! That's the right attitude. This will help ensure your trip is a delightful and joyful experience. A little prevention brings great pleasure.

== The Wellness & Fitness Seminar

​​Trainer:​​ True fitness isn't just physical; it's mental. Exercise releases endorphins, which naturally relieve stress and bring happiness. It's a positive cycle.

​​Attendee:​​ But after a long day, I'm often too indifferent to work out. I just want to relax.

​​Trainer:​​ I understand. But that passive approach can lead to chronic health issues. Even a common, usual walk can be exhilarating! The key is to find an activity that brings you joy and pleasure. When exercise is agreeable and fun, you'll be more enthusiastic.

​​Attendee:​​ So it's about shifting my attitude from "I have to" to "I get to"? Making it a desirable part of my day, not a chore?

​​Trainer:​​ Exactly! Laughter during a fun class, the thrill of achieving a new goal, the delight in feeling stronger... these are powerful medicines for the soul. It's the best therapy for a merry life.

== The Support Group Session

​​Facilitator:​​ Sharing our experiences can be a curative process. It can relieve the sense of isolation. Who would like to start?

​​Member 1:​​ My chronic illness causes me such sorrow. Sometimes I feel apathetic about treatment. It's hard to be merry when you're in constant pain.

​​Member 2:​​ I understand. But I've found that focusing on small delights helps. A good joke, a pleasant conversation... these things ease the suffering. They don't cure the disease, but they heal the spirit.

​​Member 3:​​ I agree. I was very pessimistic after my diagnosis. But I decided to be an active participant in my recovery. I take my medicine, but I also seek out joyful activities. It makes the treatment more agreeable. My attitude is now positive, and that's half the battle.

​​Facilitator:​​ Beautifully said. A positive outlook is a powerful remedy. It won't replace medical care, but it makes the journey more bearable. Let's rejoice in our small victories today.

== The Public Health Briefing

​​Health Official:​​ Good hygiene is the first line of defense. Wash your hands frequently. It's a simple but crucial precaution.

​​Reporter:​​ What about the new outbreak? Are quarantine measures being considered?

​​Health Official:​​ If the situation becomes acute, we may need to isolate confirmed cases and quarantine their contacts. It's not desirable, but it's a necessary medical measure to prevent wider suffering. We must segregate the sick from the healthy to control the spread.

​​Reporter:​​ And for treatment? What's the usual remedy?

​​Health Official:​​ For bacterial infections, antibiotics like penicillin are common. But the dose must be precise. We're optimistic about new drugs, but we must be cautious. The goal is to cure the patient and alleviate symptoms, please remember that. We want to cheer people up with good news, not cause sorrow. A positive attitude helps the recovery process.

== The Art Gallery Opening

​​Curator:​​ (To a guest) Your enthusiasm for this new artist is quite keen! I admire your zeal.

​​Guest:​​ Thank you! I'm genuinely fond of her work. It's so lively and has a certain romantic quality. It's not just picturesque; it feels sincere.

​​Curator:​​ I agree. It's surprising, really. She's a modest woman, very humble, but her art is daring and direct. There's a mysterious quality to it that makes you curious.

​​Guest:​​ It's amazing how she can be so gentle in person, yet so robust and sturdy in her artistic expression. It's a remarkable contrast.

​​Curator:​​ Absolutely. And she's very trustworthy. If she promises a piece, she delivers. She's enterprising, always ready for the next arduous project. We have great mutual respect.

​​Guest:​​ I'm grateful for the introduction. My intuition told me this would be a promising show, and I was right!

== The Wilderness Expedition Planning

​​Team Leader:​​ Okay team, this trek will be arduous. The terrain is tough. We need to be physically robust and mentally steadfast.

​​Member A:​​ I'm ready for the challenge. I'm eager to test my limits. But we must be careful; the weather can be severe and change spontaneously.

​​Member B:​​ I'm concerned about the river crossings. They might look gentle, but currents can be strenuous. We need a rigorous plan.

​​Team Leader:​​ A rigorous plan is essential, but we must also be ready to adapt. We need mutual trust; our safety depends on it. We all resemble each other in our commitment, but our strengths are similar yet different. Be frank about your abilities.

​​Member A:​​ I'm liable for navigation. My intuition is usually sound in the wilderness.

​​Member B:​​ And I'll handle the medical kit. I'm considered pretty thoughtful and sympathetic if someone gets hurt.

​​Team Leader:​​ Good. Let's be generous with our help and polite in our interactions. Even when tired, we must remain friendly. A humble and considerate attitude is crucial. This isn't a childish adventure; we need to be sane and serious. But a little humorous remark now and then can ease the tension!

== The Heart-to-Heart Talk

​​Friend A:​​ Can I be frank with you? I'm concerned. You've seemed stern lately, not your usual lively self.

​​Friend B:​​ (Sighs) I suppose I can't keep it private any longer. I had this illusion that everything was fine, but it was imaginary. My job is mundane, and I feel a naive sense that my fate is sealed. It's childish, I know.

​​Friend A:​​ Your feelings are valid. It's not naive to want more. You're one of the most sincere and trustworthy people I know. You deserve freedom to pursue something promising. You have my full confidence.

​​Friend B:​​ Thank you. That means a lot. I guess I need to be more daring. I admire your ability to be so spontaneous. My own intuition tells me to change, but I'm afraid.

​​Friend A:​​ Change is tough. But you're strong. And you have friends who are thoughtful and sympathetic. We're ready to help. You don't need to have a fancy plan, just take the first step.

​​Friend B:​​ I'm grateful for your friendship. It's an awesome feeling to have such support. Maybe I'll start by apologising to myself for being so hard on me. A little self-mercy.

== The Boardroom Pitch

​​Investor:​​ Your proposal is promising, and your track record is remarkable. But your projections seem a little... amazing, if I'm being polite. It startles me with its ambition.

​​Entrepreneur:​​ I appreciate your frankness. We've done rigorous analysis. This isn't some fancy or imaginary forecast. We're earnest about this. Our team is steadfast and enterprising.

​​Investor:​​ I don't doubt your zeal or your honesty. But the market can be severe. Are you ready for such a strenuous challenge? It's an arduous path.

​​Entrepreneur:​​ We are. We have a robust plan and a sturdy financial model. We're not naive; we're aware of the risks. But we're also confident. The mutual benefits are prominent.

​​Investor:​​ I admire your confidence. And I'm curious about one thing: your marketing strategy seems quite liberal and generous. Isn't that a bit daring?

​​Entrepreneur:​​ In today's market, you need to be direct and a little mysterious to stand out. It's a delicate balance. We believe it's a sound approach.

​​Investor:​​ Hmm. You've given me a lot to consider. I'm grateful for the detailed presentation. Your passion is quite awesome, actually.

== The Romantic Dinner

​​Person A:​​ This is lovely. You're so thoughtful for planning this. It feels so romantic here.

​​Person B:​​ I'm fond of making you happy. You seem a little startled though? Is everything okay?

​​Person A:​​ No, it's amazing! I'm just... curious. You're usually so modest and humble, but tonight you're being so direct! It's a surprising, but welcome, side of you.

​​Person B:​​ (Laughs) I'm trying to be more earnest. Life's too short for mystery all the time. I have the freedom to be sincere, right? And my intuition told me you'd appreciate it.

​​Person A:​​ I do! It's awesome. It makes me feel... I don't know, grateful. And it makes me want to be more spontaneous with you. Maybe we can plan a picturesque getaway? Something not too hectic.

​​Person B:​​ That sounds perfect. I'd be eager to do that. As long as we're together, even the mundane can feel special.

== The Teacher's Conference

​​Teacher A:​​ I'm concerned about young David. His work has become very delicate; it's not as robust as before. He used to be so keen.

​​Teacher B:​​ I've noticed he seems less lively. He's usually so polite and friendly, but lately, he's been almost stern with his classmates. It's not like him.

​​Teacher A:​​ We need to be considerate. There might be a private issue at home. We should approach him with sympathy, but be direct in our concern. He might need a gentle nudge.

​​Teacher B:​​ I agree. We must be careful not to be too severe. A temperate approach is best. He's a good kid, very sane and usually rational. Let's express our confidence in him and our readiness to help.

​​Teacher A:​​ Exactly. We admire his potential. It would be a pity if a temporary problem hampered his promising future. A little mercy and understanding can go a long way.

== The Family Reunion

​​Uncle John:​​ Well, look who it is! My favourite nephew! I must confess, I'm partial; I do have a favour for this one.

​​Nephew Mike:​​ (Laughs) Uncle John, you're too generous. It's good to be in a familiar setting. It feels like home.

​​Aunt Susan:​​ We're just so proud of you, Mike. The way you handled that arduous project at work was truly manly. It astounds me how you've grown.

​​Nephew Mike:​​ Thank you, Aunt Susan. But seriously, I couldn't have done it without family support. My gratitude is immense. I owe you all an apology for missing the last reunion; work was strictly demanding.

​​Uncle John:​​ Nonsense! No apology needed. We're just happy to have you here now. We try to be hospitable. Make yourself at home! Your success is a source of mutual pride. It's an implicit understanding in this family that we support each other.

​​Nephew Mike:​​ That means a lot. It's like a bare truth, you know? No need for pretence. You see me, not some naked ambition, just the real me. I'm seriously grateful.

== The Investment Portfolio Review

​​Financial Advisor:​​ I regret to inform you that the market volatility has caused an adverse impact on your portfolio. The returns are unsatisfactory.

​​Client:​​ This is awful! I'm filled with doubt about your strategy. I'm unwilling to endure further losses. This is so frustrating!

​​Financial Advisor:​​ I understand your distress. It's a hostile environment. But a radical shift now would be rash and arbitrary. We must tolerate some instability and not act on impulse.

​​Client:​​ I'm suspicious that you're being selfish with your fees! This is making me miserable. I grieve for my lost capital!

​​Financial Advisor:​​ That's an unkind accusation. I feel guilty about the situation, but I'm not ignorant of the markets. We need a stable plan, not a volatile one. Please don't be stubborn; let's work together.

== The Team Project Post-Mortem

​​Project Lead:​​ This project's failure is a cause for grief. The outcome is unsatisfactory, and I'm deeply disappointed.

​​Team Member A:​​ I feel ashamed. We were too careless with the initial requirements. It was a stupid mistake, and now I regret not speaking up.

​​Team Member B:​​ It's easy to feel jealous of other teams' success, but our approach was unsuitable. There was a lot of unnecessary fuss and awkward communication.

​​Project Lead:​​ This is no time for envy. We need to repent our sluggish response to the early warning signs. We were oblivious to the risks. Now we're in a troublesome situation.

​​Team Member A:​​ The client is furious. I fear we've insulted them with our clumsy delivery. I'm uneasy about the upcoming review.

​​Project Lead:​​ We must endure the criticism. We can't be reluctant to face the consequences. Let's not hesitate to admit our faults. This is a wretched situation, but we can learn from it.

== The Family Dinner Argument

​​Teenager:​​ It's so ridiculous! I'm not a child! Why do you have such a stubborn stereotype about my friends? You're so rigid!

​​Parent:​​ Don't use that vulgar tone with me! It's not a stupid rule. We have a valid suspicion about that group. They seem wicked and their influence is a nuisance.

​​Teenager:​​ That's an arbitrary judgment! You're ignorant about them! This is unbearable; you're so obtrusive in my life! It's making me miserable.

​​Parent:​​ We have a fear for your safety! Your impulsive behavior is troublesome. You've been so sluggish with your schoolwork, and now you're greedy for freedom without responsibility.

​​Teenager:​​ I hate this constant harassment! It's disgusting! You have a mean streak, and it's pushing me away! I'm unwilling to live under this hostile roof!

​​Parent:​​ (Sighs) I regret this anger. I feel guilty for yelling. But your naughty attitude and sly attempts to deceive us cause us great distress. We're not the enemy.

== The Therapy Session

​​Therapist:​​ You seem restless and uneasy today. Would you like to share what's causing you distress?

​​Client:​​ It's a vague sense of grief. I'm discouraged about everything. It's like a gloomy cloud is over me. I weep for no reason, and then feel ashamed for being so volatile.

​​Therapist:​​ There's no need for guilt. These feelings are not ridiculous. What do you think is the root of this sadness?

​​Client:​​ I envy people who seem happy. I'm jealous of their stability. I doubt I'll ever be satisfied. My life feels unstable and unsuitable. I'm reluctant to even try anymore. It's easier to be slothful.

​​Therapist:​​ That's the anxiety talking. It's a fear of failure. But avoiding life only leads to more frustration. We need to tolerate these uncomfortable feelings and understand them, not judge them as weak or stupid.

== The Political Debate Show

​​Moderator:​​ The representative's radical plan has been met with fury from the opposition. Many are indignant, calling it arbitrary and wicked.

​​Politician A:​​ It's not ridiculous! The current system is unstable and unsuitable for the future! My plan addresses the root causes of our distress!

​​Politician B:​​ That's a naive and cynical view! It's a vicious proposal that will cause agony for millions! I doubt its feasibility and suspect it's driven by ego rather than public good.

​​Politician A:​​ That's an insult! You're just jealous of our momentum! Your hatred for progress is a nuisance to this country!

​​Moderator:​​ Gentlemen, please! This anger is unpleasant for the viewers. We need less volatility and more tolerance. Can we have a civil discussion without these vulgar accusations?

== The After-Work Bar Venting

​​Colleague A:​​ I'm so furious at our boss! That was an awful meeting. He has a nasty habit of making arbitrary decisions that frustrate everyone.

​​Colleague B:​​ I know! It's a bother. He's so stubborn and rigid. He harassed Sarah over a minor detail until she was almost in tears. It was disgusting.

​​Colleague A:​​ I hate that we have to endure this. It's a hostile work environment. I'm reluctant to go in tomorrow. I sigh just thinking about it.

​​Colleague B:​​ Don't be discouraged. We just need to tolerate it until the quarterly review. Maybe then HR will see how unstable things have become. His behavior is completely unsuitable for a leader.

​​Colleague A:​​ You're less volatile than me. I have an impulse to tell him exactly what I think! But that would be stupid and probably get me fired.

​​Colleague B:​​ Yeah, that would be a rash move. Let's just have another drink and forget about it for now. No use grieving over it tonight.

== The Unfortunate Business Deal

​​Business Partner A:​​ This deal has cost us a fortune! It's a crazy loss. I'm mad with rage! I mourn the wasted time and money.

​​Business Partner B:​​ I'm sceptical about your numbers. They confuse me. And your excessive anger is a bore. It irritates me more than the loss itself.

​​Business Partner A:​​ Don't you dare frown at me! This is a weird time to be timid! We were cunning in our approach, but the market was volatile. It's an embarrassing failure.

​​Business Partner B:​​ It's not just embarrassing; it's vexing. But getting mad won't help. We need a cool head. Your impulsive reaction is making a bad situation worse. Let's not be stubborn. We need to learn from this.
