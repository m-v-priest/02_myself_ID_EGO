== The Importance of Education in Shaping Future Scientists

Education is the foundation for acquiring knowledge and developing expertise, particularly in STEM fields—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It begins at the primary level, where pupils learn rudimentary skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic, the study of numbers and basic calculations. For example, to learn is to gain understanding through study or experience, as in, “Students learn geometry by exploring shapes like triangles and circles.” To study, however, involves focused effort, such as, “She studies biology by reading textbooks and conducting experiments.”

At the secondary level, students delve into subjects like physics, the science of matter and energy, and chemistry, which examines how substances like acids or mercury interact. These subjects require students to be numerate, meaning capable of understanding numbers and calculations, unlike illiteracy, which refers to the inability to read or write. A numerate student can solve equations, such as adding to find a sum or subtracting to find a remainder, ensuring they grasp concepts like fractions or decimals.

Universities, colleges, and institutes, such as an academy for specialized training, offer advanced education. Here, students major in fields like biology or engineering and may minor in related areas like statistics, the science of collecting and analyzing data. Professors, scholars with deep expertise, and lecturers guide students, while tutors provide one-on-one support. For instance, a professor might assign a project to analyse data, meaning to examine it closely to identify patterns, as in, “They analyse survey results to predict trends.”

To qualify for a degree, such as a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctor’s, students must complete a curriculum, a structured set of courses. They enrol in classes, registering on a roster, and attend seminars or forums to discuss topics. Matriculation marks their official entry into a university. During orientation, freshers—first-year students—explore the campus, including dorms for accommodation, dining halls or canteens for meals, and laboratories for experiments.

Students submit assignments, essays, or theses to demonstrate their understanding. To submit means to formally present work, as in, “She submits her dissertation to the faculty.” They may revise their work, carefully improving it, or review it, checking for errors. For example, “He revises his essay to clarify points, then reviews it for grammar.” Plagiarism, copying another’s work without credit, is strictly avoided; instead, students cite sources, quoting or referencing authors to support their arguments.

Education instils discipline, fostering diligent and painstaking effort. To instil means to gradually impart values, like, “Teachers instil a love for learning.” Intelligent students, who grasp concepts quickly, and clever ones, who solve puzzles creatively, excel. A puzzle, a problem requiring logical thought, differs from a riddle, which is more playful and obscure, like a hidden clue. Both challenge the mind, but puzzles demand analysis, while riddles spark wit.

Graduates, celebrated at ceremonies, earn diplomas or licenses, marking their readiness for careers, perhaps as scientists or engineers. Their education equips them to contribute to fields like electronics, studying circuits and volts, or logistics, managing efficient transport systems.

文章的中文翻译

教育是获取知识和发展专长的基础，特别是在STEM领域——科学、技术、工程和数学。它始于小学阶段，学生学习基本的技能，如阅读、写作和算术，即数字和基本计算的研究。例如，学习是通过学习或经验获得理解，如“学生通过探索三角形和圆形等形状学习几何。”然而，研究涉及专注的努力，如“她通过阅读教科书和进行实验研究生物学。”

在中学阶段，学生深入研究物理学，即物质和能量的科学，以及化学，检查酸或汞等物质如何相互作用。这些科目要求学生具备计算能力，即理解数字和计算的能力，与文盲（无法阅读或写作）不同。具备计算能力的学生可以解方程，如加法求和或减法求余数，确保他们掌握分数或小数的概念。

大学、学院和研究所，如专门培训的学院，提供高等教育。在这里，学生主修生物学或工程学等学科，并可能辅修统计学等相关领域，即收集和分析数据的科学。教授，拥有深厚专长的学者，和讲师指导学生，而导师提供一对一支持。例如，教授可能分配一个分析数据的项目，分析意味着仔细检查以识别模式，如“他们分析调查结果以预测趋势。”

要获得学位，如学士、硕士或博士，学生必须完成课程体系，即一组结构化的课程。他们注册课程，在名册上登记，参加研讨会或论坛讨论话题。入学标志着他们正式进入大学。在新生入学指导期间，一年级学生探索校园，包括住宿的宿舍、餐厅或食堂，以及实验用的实验室。

学生提交作业、论文或学位论文以展示他们的理解。提交意味着正式提交工作，如“她将博士论文提交给学院。”他们可能修改作品，仔细改进，或审查作品，检查错误。例如，“他修改论文以澄清观点，然后审查语法。”抄袭，即未经许可复制他人的工作，需严格避免；相反，学生引用来源，引用或参考作者以支持他们的论点。

教育灌输纪律，培养勤奋和认真的努力。灌输意味着逐渐传授价值观，如“教师灌输对学习的热爱。”聪明的学生，快速掌握概念，和机智的学生，创造性地解决难题，表现出色。难题是需要逻辑思考的问题，与谜语不同，谜语更具娱乐性和隐晦，如隐藏的线索。两者都挑战思维，但难题需要分析，而谜语激发机智。

毕业生在毕业典礼上获得文凭或许可证，标志着他们为职业生涯做好准备，或许成为科学家或工程师。他们的教育使他们能够在电子学（研究电路和电压）或物流（管理高效运输系统）等领域做出贡献。



== STEM Education and Its Impact on Innovation

STEM education, encompassing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, is crucial for fostering innovation. At universities, students pursue majors like mechanics, the study of motion and forces, or electronics, focusing on circuits and batteries. They acquire skills through rigorous courses, meaning to gain through effort, as in, “She acquires coding skills in computer science.” This differs from learn, which is broader, as in, “He learns physics principles through lectures.”

Mathematics includes arithmetic (basic operations like plus and minus), algebra (solving equations with variables), geometry (studying shapes like rectangles or cones), and calculus (analyzing rates of change). For example, to multiply is to combine numbers to find a product, as in, “Multiply 5 by 3 to get 15,” while to divide splits a number, like, “Divide 15 by 3 to get 5.” The dividend is the number divided, and the remainder is what’s left, as in, “Divide 17 by 4; the remainder is 1.”

Students conduct experiments in laboratories, collecting data—quantitative facts like measurements or qualitative observations like color changes. To experiment means to test hypotheses, as in, “They experiment with chemicals to observe reactions.” A hypothesis is an educated guess, like, “If we dilute acid, it reacts less.” To dilute means to weaken a solution, unlike dissolve, where a substance like sugar fully blends into water, or melt, where a solid like ice turns liquid. Rust, a form of corrosion, and ferment, a chemical change in food, differ as rust is oxidative decay, while fermentation produces alcohol or acids.

Professors and mentors inspire students, giving them the impetus to innovate. To inspire is to spark enthusiasm, as in, “Her lecture inspires students to explore physics,” while to motivate drives action, like, “The prize motivates her to study harder.” Stimulate suggests triggering thought, as in, “Puzzles stimulate creative solutions,” and spur implies urgent encouragement, like, “Deadlines spur effort.”

Intelligent students, with strong aptitude, and brilliant ones, showing exceptional insight, excel in empirical research—based on observation and data. They may present findings in seminars, using charts, graphs, or matrices to illustrate results. To illustrate means to clarify with examples, as in, “A diagram illustrates the theory,” distinct from demonstrate, which shows evidence, like, “Experiments demonstrate gravity’s effect.”

Graduates with outstanding skills may earn scholarships or fellowships, financial grants for study, and awards for excellence. Their education enables them to contribute to fields like agriculture, improving crop yields, or economics, analyzing market trends.

文章的中文翻译

STEM教育，涵盖科学、技术、工程和数学，对培养创新至关重要。在大学，学生主修力学（研究运动和力）或电子学（专注于电路和电池）。他们通过严格的课程获得技能，获得意味着通过努力获得，如“她在计算机科学中获得编码技能。”这与学习不同，学习更广泛，如“他通过讲座学习物理原理。”

数学包括算术（加减等基本运算）、代数（解含变量的方程）、几何（研究矩形或圆锥等形状）和微积分（分析变化率）。例如，乘法是将数字相乘得到积，如“5乘以3得到15”，而除法是将数字分割，如“15除以3得到5。”被除数是被分割的数字，余数是剩余的部分，如“17除以4，余数是1。”

学生在实验室进行实验，收集数据——如测量值的定量事实或颜色变化的定性观察。实验意味着测试假设，如“他们用化学品实验以观察反应。”假设是基于知识的猜测，如“如果我们稀释酸，它反应较少。”稀释意味着减弱溶液，与溶解不同，溶解是如糖完全融入水中，或融化，如冰变成液体。生锈，腐蚀的一种形式，与发酵，食品的化学变化不同，因为生锈是氧化衰变，而发酵产生酒精或酸。

教授和导师激励学生，给予他们创新的动力。激励是激发热情，如“她的讲座激励学生探索物理”，而动机驱动行动，如“奖品激励她更努力学习。”刺激意味着触发思考，如“难题刺激创造性解决方案”，而催促暗示紧急鼓励，如“截止日期催促努力。”

聪明的学生，拥有强大天赋，和杰出的学生，展现卓越洞察力，在基于观察和数据的实证研究中表现出色。他们可能在研讨会上展示研究结果，使用图表、图形或矩阵来说明结果。说明意味着用例子澄清，如“图表说明理论”，与展示不同，展示是显示证据，如“实验展示重力的影响。”

具有杰出技能的毕业生可能获得奖学金或研究资助，用于学习的财政补助，以及卓越的奖项。他们的教育使他们能够在农业（提高作物产量）或经济学（分析市场趋势）等领域做出贡献。



== The Role of Social Sciences in Education

Social sciences, like sociology (studying human society), politics (examining governance), and psychology (exploring the mind), enrich education by fostering critical thinking. At colleges, deans oversee faculties, while headmasters or principals lead primary and secondary schools. A dean, a senior academic leader, differs from a principal, who manages daily school operations.

Students explore literature—books, articles, and poetry—in libraries, where they consult encyclopedias or biographies for research. To consult means to seek information, as in, “She consults a journal for data,” unlike skim, quickly reading for the gist, or scan, searching for specific details. Scrutinise involves thorough examination, like, “He scrutinises the article for errors.”

Courses cover subjects like history, tracing past events, or philosophy, exploring logic and principles. Students compose essays, meaning to write by combining ideas, as in, “She composes a thesis on politics.” This differs from draft, an initial version, like, “He drafts an outline.” They cite sources, extracting quotes or summarizing content to avoid plagiarism.

Social sciences encourage students to infer, drawing conclusions from evidence, as in, “They infer economic trends from data.” This differs from deduce, which follows strict logic, like, “She deduces the answer from the formula.” To presume assumes without proof, while to suppose is a general assumption, as in, “I suppose the theory is correct.”

Controversial issues, like policy debates, require students to compare (noting similarities) and contrast (highlighting differences) ideas. For example, “Compare the policies; contrast their outcomes.” Diverse perspectives create nuances, subtle differences in meaning, fostering debate.

Graduates in social sciences may become diplomats or ambassadors, representing nations, or pursue careers in marketing or accounting, auditing financial records. Their education achieves profound understanding, enabling them to resolve complex affairs.

文章的中文翻译

社会科学，如社会学（研究人类社会）、政治学（考察治理）和心理学（探索心理），通过培养批判性思维丰富教育。在学院，院长监督院系，而校长领导小学和中学。院长是高级学术领导，与管理日常学校运营的校长不同。

学生在图书馆探索文学——书籍、文章和诗歌，咨询百科全书或传记进行研究。咨询意味着寻求信息，如“她查阅期刊获取数据”，与快速阅读获取主旨的浏览或寻找特定细节的扫描不同。仔细检查涉及彻底审查，如“他仔细检查文章寻找错误。”

课程涵盖历史（追溯过去事件）或哲学（探索逻辑和原则）等学科。学生撰写论文，意味着通过组合想法写作，如“她撰写关于政治的论文。”这与初稿不同，初稿是初始版本，如“他起草大纲。”他们引用来源，摘录引用或总结内容以避免抄袭。

社会科学鼓励学生推断，从证据中得出结论，如“他们从数据推断经济趋势。”这与演绎不同，演绎遵循严格逻辑，如“她从公式演绎答案。”假定是没有证据的假设，而假设是一般假设，如“我假设理论是正确的。”

有争议的问题，如政策辩论，要求学生比较（指出相似性）和对比（突出差异）想法。例如，“比较政策；对比它们的结果。”不同的观点创造细微差别，即含义的细微差异，促进辩论。

社会科学毕业生可能成为外交官或大使，代表国家，或从事营销或会计职业，审计财务记录。他们的教育实现深刻的理解，使他们能够解决复杂的事务。



== Technology and Education: Preparing for the Future

Technology transforms education, enabling students to access platforms like online courses or virtual laboratories. Institutes offer programs in engineering, such as mechanics or electronics, where students study components like batteries or circuits that radiate energy or emit light. To radiate means to spread energy outward, like, “The device radiates heat,” while emit suggests releasing, as in, “The bulb emits light.”

Students learn to code, creating software to process data or design diagrams like graphs or tables. They calculate quantities, like the width or length of a rectangle, or volumes of spheres or cubes. For instance, to calculate means to compute precisely, as in, “Calculate the area using the formula.” They explore parameters, variables that define equations, and distinguish even numbers (divisible by 2) from odd ones.

In laboratories, students observe reactions, like boiling water or dissolving salts, and record results in files or profiles. To observe is to watch carefully, as in, “They observe the experiment’s outcome,” while detect finds specific evidence, like, “She detects mercury in the sample.” Discern and recognize involve deeper understanding, as in, “He discerns patterns; she recognizes theories.”

Technology courses teach practical skills, contrasting with theoretical doctrines. Students design projects, merging ideas, as in, “They merge data into a matrix.” Compulsory courses, like maths, are prerequisites, while electives allow choice. Deadlines spur effort, ensuring assignments are submitted on time.

Graduates with prestigious degrees earn esteem, building reputations as elite professionals. Some, with genius-level aptitude, innovate in fields like artificial intelligence, achieving breakthroughs. Their work avoids superficial solutions, addressing problems thoroughly.

文章的中文翻译

技术改变教育，使学生能够访问在线课程或虚拟实验室等平台。研究所提供工程学课程，如力学或电子学，学生研究电池或电路等释放能量或发光的组件。辐射意味着向外传播能量，如“设备辐射热量”，而发射暗示释放，如“灯泡发射光。”

学生学习编码，创建软件处理数据或设计图形或表格等图表。他们计算量，如矩形的宽度或长度，或球体或立方体的体积。例如，计算意味着精确计算，如“使用公式计算面积。”他们探索参数，即定义方程的变量，并区分偶数（可被2整除）和奇数。

在实验室，学生观察反应，如沸腾的水或溶解的盐，并将结果记录在文件或档案中。观察是仔细观看，如“他们观察实验结果”，而检测是发现具体证据，如“她在样本中检测到汞。”辨别和识别涉及更深的理解，如“他辨别模式；她识别理论。”

技术课程教授实用技能，与理论学说形成对比。学生设计项目，合并想法，如“他们将数据合并成矩阵。”必修课程，如数学，是先决条件，而选修课允许选择。截止日期激励努力，确保作业按时提交。

拥有声望学位的毕业生赢得尊重，建立作为精英专业人士的声誉。一些具有天才级天赋的学生在人工智能等领域创新，取得突破。他们的工作避免肤浅的解决方案，彻底解决问题。

== Advanced Learning Strategies in STEM Education

In STEM education, novices—beginners with little experience—often start as freshmen or sophomores in university, progressing to juniors and seniors before becoming alumni, former students who maintain ties with their institutions. To enhance their skills, meaning to improve or increase them, teachers emphasise key concepts, placing strong focus on them, as in, “Professors emphasise practical applications in engineering.” This differs from enable, which means to make possible, like, “The scholarship enables her to study abroad.”

Students may cram for examinations, hurriedly memorizing information, as in, “He crams formulas before the test,” but this superficial approach, focusing only on surface knowledge, lacks depth compared to thorough study, which examines details comprehensively. For instance, in maths, students learn to double a number, multiplying by two, triple by three, or quadruple by four, creating multiples. The mean, or average, is calculated by summing values and dividing by count, as in, “The mean of 2, 4, 6 is 4.”

Coed campuses, where males and females study together, offer diverse environments. Assistants, like teaching aides, support lecturers, while candidates apply for admissions, submitting applications to qualify. To apply means to formally request, as in, “She applies for a fellowship.” Once accepted, they register for courses, preview material—reviewing it in advance—or recite facts, repeating them aloud.

In laboratories, students inspect equipment, carefully checking it, and conduct experiments on topics like friction, the resistance between surfaces, or gravity, the force pulling objects. They may displace fluids, moving them aside, or observe eccentric orbits, irregular paths. In chemistry, they handle noxious substances, harmful ones, like acids that can rust metals or dilute mixtures, blending components into solutions. To blend means to mix smoothly, as in, “Blend the ingredients,” distinct from compose, which assembles parts, like, “Compose a formula.”

Geography courses explore extent, the size or scale of areas, using maps with angles, diagonals, and straight lines. Shapes like circles, round forms, or cones are analyzed, measuring width, length, and density—mass per volume. Temperatures in Fahrenheit or densities in ounces per unit are calculated approximately, roughly estimating.

Smart students, quick-witted and capable, avoid underestimating challenges—judging them too low—or overestimating abilities. They appreciate feedback, valuing constructive criticism, and persist in studies, continuing despite difficulties. To persist means to continue steadfastly, as in, “She persists in solving the problem,” while insist emphasizes strong assertion, like, “He insists on accuracy.”

Alumni often recruit novices for schemes, planned approaches to projects, granting rewards or prizes for excellence. Fees cover costs, and rewards motivate, providing incentives.

文章的中文翻译

在STEM教育中，新手——经验很少的初学者——通常作为大学新生或二年级学生开始，进步到三年级和四年级学生，然后成为校友，即与机构保持联系的前学生。为了提升他们的技能，即改善或增加它们，教师强调关键概念，对它们强烈关注，如“教授强调工程中的实际应用。”这与使可能不同，使可能意味着“奖学金使她能够出国留学。”

学生可能为考试填鸭式学习，匆忙记忆信息，如“他在测试前填鸭式学习公式，”但这种肤浅的方法，只关注表面知识，与彻底学习缺乏深度相比，后者全面考察细节。例如，在数学中，学生学习将数字加倍，即乘以二，三倍乘以三，或四倍乘以四，创建倍数。平均值，通过求和值并除以数量计算，如“2、4、6的平均值为4。”

男女合校的校园，提供多样化的环境。助教，如教学助手，支持讲师，而候选人申请入学，提交申请以资格认证。申请意味着正式请求，如“她申请研究资助。”一旦被接受，他们注册课程，预览材料——提前审查它——或背诵事实，大声重复它们。

在实验室，学生检查设备，仔细检查它，并进行关于摩擦（表面之间的阻力）或重力（拉动物体的力）的实验。他们可能置换流体，将它们移开，或观察偏心轨道，不规则路径。在化学中，他们处理有害物质，如可以生锈金属的酸或稀释混合物，将组件混合成溶液。混合意味着平滑混合，如“混合成分，”与组成不同，组成是组装部分，如“组成公式。”

地理课程探索范围，即区域的大小或规模，使用带有角度、对角线和直线的地图。分析圆形、圆形形式或圆锥等形状，测量宽度、长度和密度——每体积质量。以华氏度或每单位盎司的密度进行计算，大约估计。

聪明的学生，机敏且有能力，避免低估挑战——判断太低——或高估能力。他们欣赏反馈，重视建设性批评，并坚持学习，尽管困难继续。要坚持意味着坚定继续，如“她在解决问题中坚持，”而坚持强调强烈断言，如“他坚持准确性。”

校友常常招聘新手用于计划，即项目计划的方法，授予奖励或奖品以卓越。费用覆盖成本，奖励激励，提供激励。

== Examination and Research Methods in Higher Education

Higher education involves rigorous examinations, tests of knowledge, and quizzes, short assessments. Students prepare by reviewing syllabi, course outlines, and timetables, schedules of classes. Terms or semesters structure the academic year, with deadlines for submissions.

To comprehend complex theories, meaning to fully understand them, students analyse data, breaking it down, and diagnose issues, identifying causes like a doctor. They use inductive reasoning, drawing general conclusions from specifics, and detail nuances, subtle differences. For example, to disagree means to hold a different opinion, as in, “They disagree on the hypothesis,” while differ highlights variations, like, “The results differ slightly.”

Research requires inquiring through queries or questionnaires, surveys to gather opinions. To inquire means to ask for information, as in, “She inquires about the project,” distinct from query, a specific question in databases or searches.

Students postulate hypotheses, proposing assumptions, and speculate on outcomes, guessing without full evidence. To postulate is to suggest as a basis, like, “He postulates a new theory,” while speculate involves conjecture, as in, “They speculate on market trends.” They predict future results, foreseeing them, and perceive patterns, noticing them consciously.

In writing dissertations, they introduce topics at the outset, beginning, under headings. They outline structures, summarize gists—main points—and cite references to elicit responses, drawing out ideas. To elicit means to evoke, as in, “The question elicits debate,” unlike extract, pulling out directly, like, “Extract quotes from the text.”

Abstracts provide summaries, concise overviews, and they avoid plagiarism by not copying or printing others' work without credit. They represent data in charts, implying connections—suggesting without stating—and deliberate on findings, thinking carefully.

To accomplish goals, meaning to complete successfully, they attain high grades, achieving scores or marks. Ranks place them in order, like in a row or queue. Teachers grant credit, assigning points, and praise outstanding work, expressing approval.

Eminent scholars, respected for wisdom—deep understanding—and all-round abilities, mentor idiots, those lacking sense, to prevent abuse or spoiling through indulgence, over-pampering.

In libraries, they consult manuals, brochures, or catalogues, lists of items categorized. Indexes help find chapters in volumes, and reels store old films. Documentaries, factual series, cover biographies or tales, fictional stories like diaries or poetry in magazines.

For physics, they study ozone, a gas layer, or static electricity, unmoving charge, and inert gases, unreactive. Inherent properties, natural traits, like hollow objects displacing less.

文章的中文翻译

高等教育涉及严格的考试，即知识测试，和测验，简短评估。学生通过审查课程大纲、课程概述和时间表，即课程安排来准备。学期或学年结构学术年，有提交截止日期。

要理解复杂理论，即完全理解它们，学生分析数据，分解它，并诊断问题，识别原因如医生。他们使用归纳推理，从具体得出一般结论，并详细说明细微差别，细微差异。例如，不同意意味着持有不同意见，如“他们对假设不同意，”而不同突出变异，如“结果略有不同。”

研究要求通过查询或问卷调查，收集意见的调查。询问意味着询问信息，如“她询问项目，”与查询不同，查询是数据库或搜索中的特定问题。

学生假设假设，提出假设，并推测结果，没有充分证据的猜测。假设是作为基础建议，如“他假设新理论，”而推测涉及猜测，如“他们推测市场趋势。”他们预测未来结果，预见它们，并感知模式，有意识地注意到它们。

在写作学位论文中，他们在开头介绍话题，在标题下。他们概述结构，总结要点——主要点——并引用参考以引出响应，引出想法。引出意味着唤起，如“问题引出辩论，”不像提取，直接拉出，如“从文本提取引用。”

摘要提供总结，简洁概述，他们通过不复制或打印他人工作而不归功来避免抄袭。他们在图表中代表数据，暗示连接——不陈述建议——并仔细审议发现。

要完成目标，即成功完成，他们获得高分，达到分数或标记。排名将它们排序，如在一排或队列中。教师授予学分，分配点，并赞扬杰出工作，表达批准。

杰出的学者，因智慧——深刻理解——和全面能力而受尊重，指导傻瓜，那些缺乏理智的人，以防止通过放纵的滥用或宠坏，过度溺爱。

在图书馆，他们咨询手册、小册子或目录，即分类的项目列表。索引帮助在卷中找到章节，卷轴存储旧电影。纪录片，事实系列，覆盖传记或故事，虚构故事如日记或诗歌在杂志中。

对于物理，他们研究臭氧，气体层，或静电，不动的电荷，和惰性气体，不反应的。固有属性，自然特征，如空心物体置换较少。

'''

== Career Development and Interdisciplinary Studies

Interdisciplinary studies merge fields like economics and psychology, creating schemes for all-round development. Elite institutions recruit capable candidates, hiring them for programs. To recruit means to enlist, as in, “They recruit novices for research.”

Students develop wisdom through philosophy, gaining insight, and avoid notorious reputations, infamous ones, by earning esteem and respect. Motives drive behavior; to indulge means to allow excessively, as in, “Don’t indulge in cramming,” which can spoil success, ruining it, or lead to abuse of resources.

In engineering, they design systems with parameters, like volts in batteries or friction in mechanics. They calculate ratios, proportions like per cent or fractions, and rates. For example, maximum and minimum values define ranges, approximately estimated.

Geology explores surface features, elementary basics like rocks. Selective electives allow choice, unlike compulsory ones.

Projects involve sketching diagrams—rough drawings—and framing structures. They compile bibliographies, lists of sources, and cover contexts, surrounding circumstances.

To manifest ideas, showing them clearly, they prove theories, confirming with evidence, and resolve contradictions, solving overlaps where ideas coincide but disagree.

They introduce opinions deliberately, on purpose, and deem results valid, considering them so. To reckon means to calculate or think, as in, “I reckon the total is correct.”

Seniors mentor juniors, providing feedback to accomplish attainments. Rewards include grants or prizes, and fees are paid for courses.

In chemistry, they blend mixtures, and study eccentric elements or noxious acids. Hollow spheres or transparent materials are analyzed, displacing volumes.

文章的中文翻译

跨学科研究合并如经济学和心理学等领域，创建全面发展的计划。精英机构招聘有能力的候选人，雇用他们参加程序。招聘意味着招募，如“他们招聘新手进行研究。”

学生通过哲学发展智慧，获得洞察，并通过获得尊重和尊敬避免臭名昭著的声誉，臭名昭著的。通过过度允许驱动行为；放纵意味着“不要放纵填鸭式学习，”这可以宠坏成功，毁坏它，或导致资源滥用。

在工程中，他们设计带有参数的系统，如电池中的电压或力学中的摩擦。他们计算比率，如百分比或分数的比例，和速率。例如，最大和最小值定义范围，大约估计。

地质学探索表面特征，如岩石的基本基础。选择性选修课允许选择，与必修不同。

项目涉及素描图表——粗略绘图——和框架结构。他们编译参考书目，来源列表，并覆盖上下文，周围情况。

要显现想法，清楚显示它们，他们证明理论，用证据确认，并解决矛盾，解决想法重叠但不同意的重叠。

他们故意引入意见，有目的地，并认为结果有效，考虑它们如此。计算意味着计算或思考，如“我计算总数正确。”

高年级学生指导低年级，提供反馈以完成成就。奖励包括补助或奖品，费用为课程支付。

在化学中，他们混合混合物，并研究偏心元素或有害酸。分析空心球体或透明材料，置换体积。
