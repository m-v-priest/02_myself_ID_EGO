Poland provided the Germans an opportunity to test their strategy for victory, known as blitzkrieg or “lightning war.” It consisted of quick, massive air strikes to secure domination of the air, destroy the enemy’s ammunition stockpiles and the transportation and communications infrastructure, and generally disorient the enemy and depress morale. Then a massive land invasion of troops, fastmoving armor, and heavy artillery would overwhelm defenses. The relatively flat landscape of western Poland offered few natural barriers to traffic and suited Germany’s battle plan well, enabling the Germans to successfully employ several maneuvers to penetrate and encircle.

波兰为德国人提供了一个测试其胜利战略的机会，即所谓的闪电战或“闪电战”。它包括快速、大规模的 空袭，以确保制空权，摧毁敌人的弹药库存以及交通和通讯基础设施，并总体上迷惑敌人并打击士 气。然后，大规模的陆地入侵部队、快速移动的装甲部队和重型火炮将压倒防御。波兰西部地势相对平坦，交通 自然障碍很少，非常适合德国的作战计划，使德军能够成功地采用多种机动方式进行渗透和包围。

The British quickly discovered there was no practical way to render much assistance to the Poles. Instead, they relied on the French to engage the Germans. But the French felt they could not sustain an offensive against Germany’s western front. They preferred to prepare their defenses for an eventual German offensive against France. Britain joined the French by deploying the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to defend the French-Belgian border. By then, Poland was already lost and had been folded into Hitler’s plans of dominating Europe. During the winter of 1939–1940, little action took place on the French-German border save for a few clashes of patrols and reconnaissance units. That period of waiting has sometimes been referred to as the Phony War or, derisively, as the sitzkrieg (“sitting war”).

英国人很快发现没有切实可行的方法向波兰人提供大量援助。相反，他们依靠法国人与德国人交战。 但法国人认为他们无法维持对德国西线的进攻。他们更愿意为德国最终对法国的进攻做好防御准备。 英国与法国一起部署英国远征军（BEF）保卫法国与比利时边境。那时，波兰已经失守，并被纳入希特 勒称霸欧洲的计划之中。 1939 年至 1940 年冬季，除了巡逻队和侦察部队发生的几起冲突外，法德边 境几乎没有发生任何行动。这段等待时期有时被称为“虚假战争”，或者被嘲笑为“静坐战争”。

The German advance westward began with some forays into Norway and Denmark to the north on April 9, 1940. Not wanting to provoke German invasions, both Belgium and the Netherlands declared neutrality. This disadvantaged the British and French, since they were then not allowed to coordinate defenses with Dutch and Belgian forces or station troops in their territory. The Germans then launched their full westward offensive on May 10, 1940. Within a matter of weeks, German troops had overrun western Europe, storming through the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium and into France, avoiding the Maginot Line, a system of fortifications and weapons installations that had been built on the French border in the 1930s in order to protect France from another German invasion. Early in the morning of May 23, 1940, the British commander in France, seeing the perils of his position, gave the order to begin a withdrawal toward Dunkirk on the French coast. Eventually, this culminated in the extraordinary evacuation across the English Channel of much of the BEF and thousands of French and other Allied forces between June 15 and 25 using every British boat capable of crossing the Channel. The retreat saved 200,000 troops.

德国向西进军始于 1940 年 4 月 9 日对北部的挪威和丹麦的一些进攻。为了不想激怒德国的入侵，比利 时和荷兰都宣布中立。这对英国和法国不利，因为他们不被允许与荷兰和比利时军队协调防御或在其 领土上驻军。随后，德国人于 1940 年 5 月 10 日发起全面向西攻势。几周之内，德国军队就占领了西 欧，猛攻荷兰、卢森堡和比利时，进入法国，避开了马奇诺防线这一防御工事系统， 20 世纪 30 年代 在法国边境修建的武器设施，旨在保护法国免受德国的再次入侵。 1940 年 5 月 23 日清晨，英国驻法 指挥官看到自己阵地的危险，下令开始向法国海岸的敦刻尔克撤退。最终，6 月 15 日至 25 日期间， 英国远征军的大部分人员以及数千名法国和其他盟军部队使用每艘能够穿越英吉利海峡的英国船只， 从英吉利海峡进行了非同寻常的疏散。这次撤退拯救了20万军队。(保存有生力量，而不是像国民党在淞沪会战中被日军吃掉精锐主力)

French prime minister Paul Reynaud resigned rather than sign the armistice agreement with Germany in June 1940. Instead, Marshall Philippe Pétain, a hero of World War I, became the prime minister of a truncated French government based in Vichy, France, that, although nominally independent, cooperated with Germany.

1940 年 6 月，法国总理保罗·雷诺没有与德国签署停战协定，而是辞职。相反，第一次世界大战英雄菲 利普·贝当元帅出任法国维希政府的总理，尽管名义上该政府独立，与德国合作。

The remarkable success of the German blitzkrieg in Europe during the summer of 1940 presented the Japanese military with some significant strategic opportunities. For instance, the isolation of European colonies in Asia might make them ripe for seizing. Consequently, to provide for mutual defense and perhaps to frighten the United States away from giving more substantial assistance against them, Japan joined Germany and Italy in the defensive military alliance called the Tripartite Pact in September 1940. (Japan and Germany had earlier signed the Anti-Comintern Pact against the Soviet Union, which Japan saw as a rival for dominance in Asia, in 1936, and Italy had joined in a year later. Japan had parted ways with Germany in 1939, however, when the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact was signed, and a new agreement was thus in order.) The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, felt discouraged in the attempt to maintain peace. He observed to a colleague in February 1941, “I saw the work of eight years swept away as if by a typhoon, earthquake and a tidal wave combined.”

1940 年夏天，德国在欧洲的闪电战取得了巨大成功，为日本军队提供了一些重要的战略机遇。例如， 欧洲在亚洲的殖民地被孤立，可能会让它们成为被夺取的时机。因此，为了提供共同防御，或许也是 为了吓唬美国，使其不再向他们提供更多实质性援助，日本于 1940 年 9 月与德国和意大利一起组成了 防御性军事联盟，称为“三方条约” 。（日本和德国早些时候签署了《反美同盟条约》） - 1936 年签订 的针对苏联的共产国际条约，日本将苏联视为亚洲主导地位的竞争对手，一年后意大利也加入了该条 约，但在德苏互不侵犯条约签订时，日本于 1939 年与德国分道扬镳。美国驻日本大使约瑟夫·格鲁 （Joseph Grew）对维持和平的努力感到灰心。 1941 年 2 月，他对一位同事说：“我看到八年的工作 就像被台风、地震和海啸一起卷走了。”

Hitler planned to finish off Britain with a cross-channel invasion using air and submarine bases in both Norway, which had surrendered in June 1940, and northern France. Through the late summer and into the fall of 1940, the Battle of Britain raged in the skies over Britain as a duel between the German Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force (RAF). The Germans initially focused their attacks on shipping in the English Channel and then began to bomb weapons-production facilities.

Aided in part by the innovation of radar, which gave some advance warning of German onslaughts, the RAF prevailed.

When the Luftwaffe shifted its focus from military to civilian targets, particularly the bombing of London, it inadvertently gave the British the opportunity to rebuild their airfields and defense plants and assemble more planes.

希特勒计划利用 1940 年 6 月投降的挪威和法国北部的空军和潜艇基地，通过跨海峡入侵来消灭英国。 从夏末到 1940 年秋天，不列颠之战在英国上空激烈进行，是德国空军和英国皇家空军(RAF) 之间的对 决。德国人最初将攻击重点放在英吉利海峡的航运上，然后开始轰炸武器生产设施. 英国皇家空军取得了胜 利，这在一定程度上得益于雷达的创新，雷达对德国的进攻发出了一些预先警告。. 当德国空军将重点从军事目 标转向民用目标时，特别是对伦敦的轰炸，无意中给了英国人重建机场和国防工厂以及组装更多飞机 的机会。

In the 1930s, the United States wanted to insulate itself from conflicts in the rest of the world. Aroused by dramatic hearings into the causes of the country’s entry into World War I, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts in 1935, 1936, and 1937, forbidding the export of arms and the making of loans to belligerent nations. These acts effectively handcuffed the government. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in 1933 just two months after Hitler became chancellor of Germany, was prevented from rendering much assistance to China against Japan, to Ethiopia against Italy, or to Republican Spain against fascist General Franco. But the 1937 Neutrality Act granted Roosevelt a little leeway. The United States could render nonmilitary assistance such as oil to a belligerent nation if that nation could both pay cash for the goods and carry them home itself.

20 世纪 30 年代，美国希望使自己免受世界其他地区冲突的影响。受到关于该国加入第一次世界大战 原因的戏剧性听证会的激励，国会于 1935 年、1936 年和 1937 年通过了《中立法案》 ，禁止向交战 国出口武器和提供贷款。这些行为有效地束缚了政府。富兰克林·罗斯福总统于 1933 年上任，就在希 特勒就任德国总理两个月后，他无法向中国提供大量援助以对抗日本，也无法向埃塞俄比亚提供大量 援助以对抗意大利，也无法向共和西班牙提供大量援助以对抗法西斯佛朗哥将军。但 1937 年的中立法 案给了罗斯福一点回旋余地。美国可以向交战国提供石油等非军事援助，前提是该国既能支付现金购 买货物，又能自行运回国内。

As the world watched Hitler annex Czechoslovakia and then invade Poland, Roosevelt sought to offer more substantial military assistance to Britain and France. To beef up the defenses of the United States, Roosevelt pressed Congress to approve a two-ocean navy in 1938 and began to funnel aid to Britain and China within the confines of what was allowable. After much debate, in November 1939 Congress repealed provisions of earlier Neutrality Acts and authorized trade in military hardware on a cash-and-carry basis. With the Luftwaffe struggling in the summer of 1940, the responsibility for subduing England increasingly fell to the German submarine fleet, on the theory that England could be starved to death. Roosevelt created the Atlantic squadron in January 1939 and gradually expanded a U.S. naval patrol and escort service for shipping headed for England.

当全世界目睹希特勒吞并捷克斯洛伐克，然后入侵波兰时，罗斯福寻求向英国和法国提供更多实质性 军事援助。为了加强美国的防御，罗斯福于 1938 年敦促国会批准建立横跨两洋的海军，并开始在允许 的范围内向英国和中国提供援助。经过多次辩论，国会于 1939 年 11 月废除了早期中立法案的条款， 并授权以现购自运的方式进行军事硬件贸易。 1940 年夏天，随着德国空军陷入困境，征服英国的责任 越来越多地落到了德国潜艇舰队身上，因为他们认为英国可能会被饿死。罗斯福于 1939 年 1 月创建了 大西洋中队，并逐渐扩大了美国海军的巡逻和护航服务，为前往英国的船只提供服务。

In one ten-day period in July 1940, German submarines sank eleven British destroyers, prompting the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, to appeal to the United States for help. Liberally interpreting the Neutrality Act of 1939, Roosevelt agreed to exchange fifty World War I–era destroyers for lease rights at British naval bases in Newfoundland and the Caribbean. Critics and isolationists like aviator Charles Lindbergh, a leader of the America First Committee, took Roosevelt to task. But in March 1941, the president persuaded Congress to approve the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the government to “sell, transfer title to, exchange, lease, lend or otherwise dispose of, to any such government any defense article.” The United States could now provide these materials to any country deemed vital to its own defense. It was a way to aid those countries already fighting but without taking direct military action.

1940 年 7 月，德国潜艇在短短十天内击沉了 11 艘英国驱逐舰，英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔向美国求助。 罗斯福对 1939 年的中立法案进行了自由的解释，同意用 50 艘第一次世界大战时期的驱逐舰换取纽芬 兰和加勒比海英国海军基地的租赁权。美国第一委员会领导人、飞行员查尔斯·林德伯格等批评者和孤 立主义者对罗斯福提出了批评。但 1941 年 3 月，总统说服国会批准《租借法案》 ，该法案允许政府 “向任何此类政府出售、转让所有权、交换、租赁、出借或以其他方式处置任何国防物品”。美国现在可 以向任何被认为对其自身防御至关重要的国家提供这些材料。这是援助那些已经在战斗但不采取直接 军事行动的国家的一种方式。

In the 1930s, many in the United States were reluctant to find themselves embroiled in another war. As Hitler’s power grew in Europe and Japan expanded its empire in the Pacific, the United States thus adopted a policy of neutrality. This continued even after Japan invaded China and Germany invaded Poland and ultimately western Europe. Although President Franklin Roosevelt favored aiding the British, his opponents in Congress feared the potential consequences.

20 世纪 30 年代，许多美国人不愿意卷入另一场战争。随着希特勒在欧洲的势力增强和日本 在太平洋扩张帝国，美国因此采取了中立政策。即使在日本入侵中国、德国入侵波兰并最终 入侵西欧之后，这种情况仍在继续。尽管富兰克林·罗斯福总统赞成援助英国，但他在国会的 反对者担心潜在的后果。

The defeat of Poland removed a buffer between German-occupied and Soviet territory. When Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, Stalin began to take steps to prepare the USSR for what might happen next. At the end of 1939, he launched the “Winter War” against Finland to obtain territory near Leningrad (the city formerly known as St. Petersburg or Petrograd) that would bolster Soviet defenses. In April 1941, the Soviets signed a Neutrality Pact with Japan, freeing both nations from the prospect of a multiple-front war. The Kremlin in Moscow received a continuous stream of intelligence warning of an impending invasion. After receiving one such report outlining German battle plans, Stalin called up half a million reservists. Yet, fearing to provoke the Germans into action, he was cautious with his forces.

波兰的失败消除了德国占领区和苏联领土之间的缓冲区。 1939 年 9 月 1 日德国入侵波兰时，斯大林开 始采取措施让苏联做好应对接下来可能发生的事情的准备。 1939年底，他对芬兰发动了“冬季战争”， 以获得列宁格勒（该城市以前称为 圣彼得堡或彼得格勒）附近的领土，以加强苏联的防御。 1941 年 4 月，苏联与日本签署了中立条约，使两国摆脱了多线战争的前景。莫斯科克里姆林宫不断收到有关即 将发生入侵的情报警告。在收到一份概述德国作战计划的报告后，斯大林召集了五十万预备役军人。 然而，由于担心激怒德国人采取行动，他对自己的部队非常谨慎。

Having detected flaws in the Soviet Union’s invasion of Poland and its struggle against Finland in the Winter War, Hitler was confident he could defeat Stalin. Betraying the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, he assembled the largest land-invasion force in world history, more than three million troops, including contributions from countries with their own grievance against the Soviet Union such as Finland, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Italy, Slovakia, and Spain. Operation Barbarossa began on June 22, 1941, leading the Soviet Union to formally join the Allies in opposing Germany.

希特勒发现了苏联入侵波兰以及冬季战争中与芬兰的斗争中的缺陷，他有信心能够击败斯大林。他背 叛德苏互不侵犯条约，集结了世界历史上最大规模的陆地入侵部队，超过三百万军队，其中包括芬 兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、南斯拉夫、意大利等对苏联有不满的国家。斯洛伐克、西班牙。巴巴罗萨行 动于1941年6月22日开始，带领苏联正式加入同盟国对抗德国

Operation Barbarossa. The goal of Hitler’s Operation Barbarossa was the invasion of the Soviet Union.

巴巴罗萨行动。希特勒巴巴罗萨行动的目标是入侵苏联。

The speed of the German attack was greater than anticipated, and within weeks, Belorussia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia had been occupied by the German army, which was called the Wehrmacht (“defense power”). By August, the Germans had captured Kyiv, an industrial center that contained a large portion of the Soviet economic infrastructure at that time. By November, Hitler had gone farther into Russia than Napoleon had. The German army stood at the gates of Leningrad, on the outskirts of Moscow, and on the Don River.

德国进攻的速度比预想的要快，几周之内， 白俄罗斯、立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚就被德国军队占领，这支军队被称为国防军（“国防力量”）。 到八月，德国人占领了基辅，这是一个工业中心，其中包含了当时苏联大部分经济基础设施。到了十 一月，希特勒已经比拿破仑更深入地进入俄罗斯了。德军驻扎在列宁格勒城门、莫斯科郊区和顿河河 畔。

But serious problems arose that came back to haunt the Germans. The speed of the advance had strained the delivery of supplies. The force advancing on Moscow needed nearly thirty train shipments of fuel each day to maintain its pace, but by November, it was receiving only three. In August, a shortage of clean water had spread dysentery and cholera among the troops. When the late summer rains came, German soldiers found that they could neither drive fast (because of mud) nor keep themselves and their equipment dry. Once the Russian winter began, it became so cold that bread rations froze and had to be chopped into portions with axes.

但严重的问题再次困扰着德国人。前进的速度使得物资的运送变得紧张。向莫斯科挺进的部队每天需 要近三十列火车运送燃料才能维持其速度，但到了 11 月，它只收到了三列。八月份，由于清洁水的短 缺，痢疾和霍乱在部队中蔓延。当夏末的雨来临时，德国士兵发现他们既不能开快车（因为泥泞）， 也不能保持自己和装备干燥。俄罗斯的冬天一开始，天气就变得非常寒冷，口粮面包都结冰了，必须 用斧头切成小块。

The siege of Leningrad lasted 872 days and was one of the longest and deadliest in world history. In early 1942, nearly 100,000 people in the city starved to death each month, and some of the remaining residents resorted to cannibalism to survive. Overall, a million and a half people perished. Facing this, Stalin seems to have momentarily faltered. By the end of 1941, his head of security was instructed to send feelers to the Germans through the Bulgarian ambassador to Moscow, broaching the possibility of peace.

列宁格勒围困持续了 872 天，是世界历史上持续时间最长、伤亡最惨重的围困之一。 1942年初，该市 每个月有近10万人饿死，一些剩下的居民靠吃人肉来生存。总共有一百五十万人丧生。面对这一点， 斯大林似乎一时动摇了。 1941 年底，他的安全负责人奉命通过保加利亚驻莫斯科大使向德国人发出试 探，提出和平的可能性。

With the war expanding into the plains of Russia, Churchill requested a face-to-face meeting with Roosevelt, who secretly sailed to Newfoundland in August 1941 for the purpose. This conference was the first of what have since become commonplace events in diplomacy—summit meetings of the heads of state. The two leaders produced the Atlantic Charter, a recasting of the principles articulated in Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points (1918) into eight major points that reflected British and U.S. goals for a postwar world, though not the Soviet Union’s goals for Europe. It insisted on the unconditional surrender of the Axis nations—Germany, Italy, and Japan—renounced any territorial expansion, and affirmed the right of self-determination. There would be freedom of the seas, reduced barriers to free trade, and promotion of social welfare through economic cooperation. Peace would be promoted through the disarmament of aggressor nations.

随着战事扩展到俄罗斯平原，丘吉尔要求与罗斯福进行面对面的会面，罗斯福为此于 1941 年 8 月秘密 航行至纽芬兰。这次会议是后来成为外交领域司空见惯的国家元首峰会的第一次会议。两位领导人制 定了《大西洋宪章》 ，将伍德罗·威尔逊的十四点（1918）中阐述的原则重新改写为八个要点，反映了 英国和美国对战后世界的目标，但不是苏联对欧洲的目标。它坚持轴心国——德国、意大利和日本 ——无条件投降，放弃任何领土扩张，并确认自决权。海洋自由、自由贸易壁垒减少、通过经济合作 促进社会福利。通过解除侵略国的武装将促进和平。

Trying to pressure the Japanese into ceasing their aggression, in August 1941 the United States imposed sanctions including an embargo on oil and gas sales to Japan. This action further reinforced Japan’s plan to turn to the South Pacific to absorb the natural resources of the crumbling European imperial regimes and the Philippines, a U.S. colony. Seeing the United States as a soft enemy unwilling to make the sacrifices needed to win a war, Japan planned a surprise assault on the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, while last-ditch efforts at a diplomatic settlement between Tokyo and Washington were taking place. The United States wanted Japan to ultimately withdraw from China, to which it would not agree, and Japan felt the United States would not be open to further negotiations. Its leaders decided they had to move against the United States while they still could.

为了迫使日本停止侵略，美国于 1941 年 8 月实施了制裁，包括禁止向日本销售石油和天然气。这一行 动进一步强化了日本转向南太平洋吸收摇摇欲坠的欧洲帝国政权和美国殖民地菲律宾自然资源的计 划。日本将美国视为不愿意为赢得战争而做出必要牺牲的软敌人，因此计划对夏威夷珍珠港海军基地 发动突然袭击，同时东京和华盛顿之间正在进行最后的外交解决努力。美国希望日本最终从中国撤 军，但美国不同意，日本认为美国不会对进一步谈判持开放态度。它的领导人决定，他们必须趁他们 还可以的时候对美国采取行动。

U.S. intelligence services had broken various Japanese codes, and by late November 1941, warnings were being sent to U.S. forces that war with Japan was likely, with the Philippines as the probable target. Early in the morning of December 7, a Japanese task force successfully eluded detection in a surprise attack that devastated the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor. Near-simultaneous attacks were launched on U.S. bases in the Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island. The following day, Congress voted unanimously to declare war on Japan. A few days later, following Germany’s and Italy’s declarations of war against the United States, the country entered the war in Europe as well on the side of the Allies. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, China also joined the Allies, but it did not join in the fighting in Europe.

美国情报部门破译了日本的各种密码，到 1941 年 11 月下旬，美国军队收到了可能与日本发生战争的 警告，而菲律宾可能是目标。 12 月 7 日凌晨，一支日本特遣部队在一次突袭中成功逃脱了侦查，这场 袭击摧毁了珍珠港的美国舰队. 菲律宾、关岛和威克岛的美国基地几乎 同时遭到袭击。第二天，国会一致投票决定对日宣战。几天后，随着德国和意大利对美国宣战，该国 也加入了同盟国一边的欧洲战争。珍珠港事件后，中国也加入了同盟国，但没有参加欧洲的战斗。

Leadership of the troops fell to Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was rapidly promoted through the ranks to become a key aide to Chief of Staff George C. Marshall and commanding general of the European theater of operations.

(美国)军队的领导权落到了德怀特·D·艾森豪威尔的肩上，他迅速 晋升为参谋长乔治·C·马歇尔的重要助手和欧洲战区的总司令。

Britain and the United States planned early in the war to focus on defeating Italy and Germany before Japan but left the Soviet Union to battle Germany alone. In Asia, the “liberation” of the inhabitants of European and U.S. colonies by Japanese troops only replaced Western rule with Japanese rule, igniting or giving impetus to nationalist movements.

英国和美国在战争 初期计划集中精力在日本之前击败意大利和德国，但让苏联独自与德国作战。在亚洲，日本军队对欧 洲和美国殖民地居民的“解放”只是以日本的统治取代了西方的统治，点燃或推动了民族主义运动。

Beginning in 1938 and through the spring of 1941, U.S. military leaders produced several plans of action in the event of war with the Axis powers. Immediately after winning an unprecedented third term in 1940, Roosevelt was briefed by his chief of naval operations, Admiral Harold R. Stark, who advised him that the best military strategy was “Plan D”—a Europe First plan. This focused the United States and Britain on defeating Germany and Italy first and adopting a defensive posture against Japan if it entered the war.

从 1938 年开始一直到 1941 年春，美国军事领导人制定了数项在与轴心国发生战争时的行动计划。 1940 年史无前例地赢得第三个任期后，罗斯福立即听取了海军作战部长哈罗德·R·斯塔克上将的简报， 后者建议他最好的军事战略是“D 计划”——欧洲优先计划。这使得美国和英国的重点是首先击败德国和 意大利，如果日本参战，则对日本采取防御姿态。

Mussolini decided to expand his African holdings and in August 1940 occupied British Somaliland, threatening the British in Egypt. The British counterattacked. Losing ground in Africa from June through December 1940, Mussolini turned his eyes on the Balkans. In October 1940, expecting an easy victory, Italian units invaded Greece but were badly defeated. To forestall further disaster, Hitler dispatched General Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps to duel with the British in northeast North Africa. Not only did Germany wish to support its Italian ally, but it also sought to gain control of the Suez Canal and guarantee its access to Middle Eastern oil, which would be crucial in winning the war. To further aid his faltering ally and deal with an anti-German uprising in Yugoslavia, Hitler postponed his invasion of the Soviet Union by several weeks and invaded Greece on April 6, 1941.

墨索里尼决定扩大其非洲领土，并于 1940 年 8 月占领英属索马里兰，威胁埃及的英国人。英国人发起 反击。 1940 年 6 月至 12 月，墨索里尼在非洲节节败退，他将目光投向了巴尔干地区。 1940 年 10 月，意大利军队本以为能轻松获胜，于是入侵希腊，但遭到惨败。为了防止进一步的灾难，希特勒派 遣埃尔文·隆美尔将军和他的非洲军团在北非东北部与英国人决斗。德国不仅希望支持其盟友意大利， 而且还寻求控制苏伊士运河并保证其获得中东石油，这对于赢得战争至关重要。为了进一步援助他摇 摇欲坠的盟友并应对南斯拉夫的反德起义，希特勒将入侵苏联的时间推迟了几周，并于 1941 年 4 月 6 日入侵希腊。

Fearing that any substantial British effort against the Germans in Norway or northern France would become a slaughter, Winston Churchill conceived Operation Gymnast, a plan to engage the Germans in northwest Africa instead. On a military mission to London in July 1942, General Eisenhower was deeply disappointed in Churchill’s approach, considering how badly the Soviets were suffering from German offensives. General George C. Marshall favored opening a front in northern Europe in order to draw German resources away from its attack on the Soviet Union before the Soviets collapsed. But Churchill prevailed, and the Allies, now including the United States, invaded French North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia) in November 1942. Key British possessions Egypt and the Suez Canal were saved, and in a January 1943 summit meeting at Casablanca in French Morocco, Churchill and Roosevelt planned the next phase of the war, Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. This choice disappointed Stalin, who had been hoping for an invasion of western Europe instead, to draw German troops away from the fighting in the east and the Soviet Union.

由于担心英国在挪威或法国北部针对德国人的任何实质性行动都会成为一场屠杀，温斯顿·丘吉尔构想 了“体操运动员行动” ，这是一项在西北非与德国人交战的计划。 1942 年 7 月，艾森豪威尔将军在前往 伦敦执行军事任务时，考虑到苏联在德国进攻中遭受的损失有多么严重，他对丘吉尔的做法深感失 望。乔治·C·马歇尔将军赞成在北欧开辟一条战线，以便在苏联解体之前将德国的资源从对苏联的攻击 中抽走。但丘吉尔获胜，包括美国在内的盟军于 1942 年 11 月入侵法属北非（阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和 突尼斯）。英国的重要领地埃及和苏伊士运河得救，并于 1943 年 1 月在卡萨布兰卡举行了首脑会议在 法属摩洛哥，丘吉尔和罗斯福计划了战争的下一阶段“哈士奇行动”，即入侵西西里岛。这一选择让斯大 林感到失望，他一直希望入侵西欧，以将德国军队从东部和苏联的战斗中吸引出来。

In August 1941, given the initial success of the German invasion and poised to capture Moscow, Hitler delayed the advance to decide strategy. The German general staff wanted to drive directly for Moscow and take it before winter. Hitler, however, diverted a significant part of his forces to the south. Both Allied and Axis thinkers had long recognized the strategic military importance of oil. For some time prior to the war, the British government had interjected itself into the politics of Iraq, Persia, Afghanistan, and Egypt for this reason. The Germans too had taken a keen interest in the Middle East and central Asia in the 1930s.

1941年8月，鉴于德国入侵取得初步成功并准备占领 莫斯科，希特勒推迟了进攻以决定战略。德国总参谋部想直接驱车前往莫斯科，并在冬季之前占领。 然而，希特勒将其大部分军队转移到南方。同盟国和轴心国的思想家很早就认识到石油的战略军事重 要性。战前一段时间，英国政府也因此插手伊拉克、波斯、阿富汗和埃及的政治。德国人在 20 世纪 30 年代也对中东和中亚产生了浓厚的兴趣。

To block potential German access to Iranian oil, the British first demanded the possibly pro-German Shah expel Germans and sever ties with Berlin. Taking no chances, British and Soviet forces then invaded Iran in August 1941. Iranian resistence collapsed in a couple of days, and Reza Shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Germans were expelled, and the Allied occupation lasted until 1946. During those years, Iran became a funnel through which much Allied aid, especially from the United States, was delivered to Stalin as he struggled to hold out against the Wehrmacht.

为了阻止德国获得伊朗石油，英国首先要求可能亲德的国王驱逐德国人并断绝与柏林的关系。英国和 苏联军队不顾一切地于 1941 年 8 月入侵伊朗。几天之内伊朗的抵抗就崩溃了，礼萨·沙阿被迫退位， 让位给他的儿子穆罕默德·礼萨·巴列维。德国人被驱逐，盟军的占领一直持续到 1946 年。在那些年 里，伊朗成为一个漏斗，许多盟军的援助，特别是来自美国的援助，通过这个漏斗被运送到斯大林， 因为他正在努力抵抗国防军。

By 1939, the global supply of oil was in the hands of seven oil conglomerates—none of which were German. Consequently, Germany was heavily reliant on Romanian and Soviet oil between 1939 and 1941. The oil fields in the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan, one thousand kilometers from Stalingrad, looked like a possible solution, so the German army moved to capture the city of Baku, the center of the Soviet oil-drilling industry. Thus, both winter and the German drive for oil saved Moscow.

到 1939 年，全球石油供应掌握在七家石油集团手中，其中没有一家是德国石油集团。因此，德国在 1939 年至 1941 年间严重依赖罗马尼亚和苏联的石油。距离斯大林格勒 1000 公里的阿塞拜疆苏维埃 共和国的油田看起来是一个可能的解决方案，因此德军进攻巴库市，苏联石油钻探工业中心。因此， 冬季和德国的石油开采拯救了莫斯科。

In the summer of 1942, the Germans resumed the offensive on all fronts but were unable to get far, except for approaching Stalingrad. Hitler was determined to take the city and Stalin to hold it. In July, Stalin issued Order No. 227 forbidding Soviet troops from retreating: “Not one step backwards!” By the fall of 1942, German troops had actually broken into Stalingrad, but their progress thereafter was gruesomely slow and difficult. For more than two months, the Battle of Stalingrad raged with ferocity.

1942年夏天，德军在各条战线上恢复进攻，但除了逼近斯大林格勒外，无法走得太远。希特勒决心占 领这座城市，而斯大林则要守住它。 7月，斯大林发布第227号命令，禁止苏军撤退：“寸步不让！” 1942 年秋，德国军队实际上已攻入斯大林格勒，但此后的进展极其缓慢且艰难。在两个多月的时间 里，斯大林格勒战役异常激烈

Having assembled sufficient forces, in November 1942 the Soviet Red Army counterattacked at Stalingrad and managed to trap the Germans in a noose. The only way for the Germans to resupply was by air, which was far too limited to sustain them for very long. Despite being specifically forbidden to do so, on January 31, 1943, German field marshal Friedrich Paulus surrendered what was left of his Sixth Army. The Soviets captured close to 100,000 German troops. Total casualties in the battle had reached nearly two million, including substantial numbers of civilians. The Battle of Stalingrad stopped the German advance into the Soviet Union. It was the first clear defeat for Hitler’s Germany and the turning point of the war in Europe, setting the Nazis on a defensive course for the remainder of the war.

1942 年 11 月，苏联红军集结了足够的兵力，在斯大林格勒发起反攻，成功将德军困在绞索中。德国 人补给的唯一途径是空中，但空中运输的能力太有限，无法维持很长时间。尽管被明确禁止这样做， 德国陆军元帅弗里德里希·保卢斯还是在 1943 年 1 月 31 日交出了他的第六集团军的残部。苏联俘虏了 近10万德军。战斗中的总伤亡人数已接近两百万，其中包括大量平民。斯大林格勒战役阻止了德国向 苏联的进军。这是希特勒德国的第一次明显失败，也是欧洲战争的转折点，使纳粹在战争的剩余时间 里走上了防御路线。

From the time of his first meeting with Churchill in August 1942, a frustrated Stalin had been calling for a second front against the Nazis in Europe. In the summer of 1943, the Soviets, fresh from saving Stalingrad, went on the offensive against the Germans. The ensuing Battle of Kursk was the biggest land battle of the war and the largest tank battle in history.

从 1942 年 8 月第一次与丘吉尔会面起，沮丧的斯大林就一直呼吁在欧洲建立第二条战线来对抗纳粹。 1943 年夏天，刚刚拯救斯大林格勒的苏联人开始对德国人发起进攻。随后的库尔斯克战役是战争中规 模最大的陆战，也是历史上规模最大的坦克战。

Mussolini had insisted on contributing 200,000 troops to the invasion of the Soviet Union, and by early 1943, half of them had become casualties. Allied victories in North Africa and Sicily, along with the Allied bombing of Rome in July 1943, further humiliated Mussolini. In Italy, a coalition of former fascist supporters, military officers, the few surviving liberal politicians, and the king himself reached the conclusion that Mussolini must go. The Grand Fascist Council met for the first time in three years on July 24, 1943, and voted overwhelmingly to remove him from power and place him under arrest.

墨索里尼坚持派遣20万军队入侵苏联，到1943年初，其中一半人伤亡。盟军在北非和西西里岛的胜 利，以及 1943 年 7 月盟军对罗马的轰炸，进一步羞辱了墨索里尼。在意大利，由前法西斯支持者、军 官、少数幸存的自由派政治家和国王本人组成的联盟得出了墨索里尼必须下台的结论。 1943 年 7 月 24 日，法西斯大委员会三年来首次召开会议，以压倒性多数投票决定罢免他并逮捕他。

A government was formed under Marshal Pietro Badoglio, who initiated secret negotiations with the Allies. The Allied invasion of the mainland of Italy at the beginning of September provided the impetus for Italy’s surrender on September 8, 1943. Four days later, Hitler had German special forces rescue Mussolini. German troops already in Italy then moved to disarm the remnants of the Italian army and established a government called the Republic of Salo in northern Italy, with Mussolini as its figurehead. However, Italian communist partisans captured and executed Mussolini in April 1945.

彼得罗·巴多格里奥元帅领导的政府成立，他发起了与盟军的秘密谈判。 9月初盟军入侵意大利本土， 为1943年9月8日意大利投降提供了动力。四天后，希特勒派德国特种部队营救墨索里尼。随后，已经 驻扎在意大利的德国军队解除了意大利军队残部的武装，并在意大利北部建立了一个名为萨罗共和国 的政府，以墨索里尼为傀儡。然而，1945年4月，意大利共产党游击队抓获并处决了墨索里尼。

Earlier, with Iran secured through the Allied invasion, Tehran had been the site of the first of the World War II conferences between the “Big Three”: Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin. From November 28 to December 1, 1943, the Tehran conference addressed relations between the Allies, relations between Turkey and Iran, operations in Yugoslavia, the fight against Japan, and plans for the postwar settlement. A protocol signed at the conference pledged the Big Three’s recognition of Iran’s independence. The Big Three also agreed on a cross-channel invasion of Europe scheduled for May 1944, in conjunction with a Soviet attack on Germany’s eastern border. Stalin dominated the conference, using Soviet victories to get preliminary agreements on the borders of Poland after the war. Churchill and Roosevelt also consented to the USSR setting up governments sympathetic to itself in the Baltic states. Roosevelt and Stalin continued their discussions of a general international organization that had been proposed a few months earlier.

早些时候，随着盟军入侵伊朗，德黑兰成为丘吉尔、罗斯福和斯大林“三巨头”之间第一次二战会议的举 办地。 1943年11月28日至12月1日，德黑兰会议讨论了盟国关系、土耳其与伊朗关系、南斯拉夫行 动、对日作战以及战后解决计划等问题。会议上签署的一项协议承诺三巨头承认伊朗的独立。三巨头 还同意定于 1944 年 5 月跨海峡入侵欧洲，同时苏联也进攻德国东部边境。斯大林主导了这次会议，利 用苏联的胜利在战后就波兰边界达成了初步协议。丘吉尔和罗斯福还同意苏联在波罗的海国家建立同 情自己的政府。罗斯福和斯大林继续讨论几个月前提议的一般性国际组织。

When the Japanese invaded the Philippines beginning in December 1941, the limited U.S. and Filipino forces put up stiff resistance in jungle fighting. Outnumbered, however, they surrendered their positions on the Bataan Peninsula on April 9, 1942. The command headquarters surrendered at Corregidor Island nearly a month later. The resulting sixty-mile forced march to an internment camp led to the deaths of more than a quarter of the estimated eighty thousand Allied prisoners and became known as the Bataan Death March. Over the course of the war, the Japanese held approximately 140,000 Allied troops under severe conditions at various camps in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and on the Japanese home islands. By the end of the war, as many as thirty thousand had perished there.

1941 年 12 月，日本入侵菲律宾时，美国和菲律宾有限的军队在丛林战斗中进行了顽强抵抗。然而， 由于寡不敌众，他们于 1942 年 4 月 9 日投降了巴丹半岛的阵地。近一个月后，指挥部在科雷希多岛投 降。由此产生的向拘留营的六十英里强行军导致估计八万名盟军囚犯中四分之一以上死亡，并被称为 巴丹死亡行军。战争期间，日本在大东亚共荣圈和日本本土的各个营地中关押了约 14 万盟军，条件十 分恶劣。到战争结束时，已有三万人在那里丧生。

Five months into 1942, the Japanese had gathered a significant portion of Burma, Malaya and the Straits Settlements, Indonesia, French Indochina, and the Philippines into the Greater East Asia Co- Prosperity Sphere (Figure 13.12). While deconstructing White colonial rule, the Japanese began to systematically exploit the liberated areas for their resources in support of a greater Japan. However impressive the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was on paper, however, the Japanese military and civilian administrators were hard-pressed to solve significant problems. The extent of the area under control and the size of the captive population presented governance issues, while geography severely strained communication and transportation networks. Puppet regimes were an attempt to solve some of these problems, such as the collaborationist regime in China under Wang Jingwei in 1940, the Ba Maw government in Burma during the Japanese occupation, and the administration of José P. Laurel in the defeated Philippines.

1942 年 5 个月后，日本人将缅甸、马来亚和海峡殖民地、印度尼西亚、法属印度支那和菲律宾的大部 分地区纳入大东亚共荣圈（图 13.12 ）。在解构白人殖民统治的同时，日本人开始系统地开发解放区 的资源，以支持一个更大的日本。无论大东亚共荣圈在纸面上多么令人印象深刻，日本军民管理者却 很难解决重大问题。控制区域的范围和圈养人口的规模带来了治理问题，而地理因素也给通讯和交通 网络带来了严重的压力。傀儡政权就是解决其中一些问题的尝试，例如 1940 年汪精卫领导下的中国通 敌政权、日本占领期间的缅甸巴莫政府以及战败菲律宾的若泽·P·劳雷尔政府。

Japan in the Pacific Theater. Between 1937 and 1942, Japan launched attacks against and gained control of far-flung territory throughout East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific.

日本在太平洋战区。 1937 年至 1942 年间，日本对东亚、东南亚和太平洋地区的广大领土发动攻击并控制了这些领土。

became the turning point of the war in the Pacific—the Battle of Midway, which stopped Japan’s advance across the Pacific. The balance of power clearly shifted toward the Allies, and the Japanese navy never recovered its momentum.

然而，成功是短暂的，因为1942年6月，美国决定性地赢得了太平洋战争的转折点——中途岛海战，阻 止了日本跨太平洋的前进. 力量平 衡明显向同盟国倾斜，日本海军再也没有恢复势头。

Pursuing an island-hopping campaign to roll back Japanese seizures of land, the United States frequently had to engage the Japanese in dense jungle terrains.

为了开展跳岛运动以击退日本占领的土地，美国经常不得不在茂密的丛林地带与日本人交战。

The Japanese military made many missteps across the Pacific. An early attempt to capture part of the Aleutian Islands failed. The defensive perimeters of Japan’s home islands were constantly redrawn over 1942 and 1943. Without reevaluating its strategies, Japan transferred forces from China to plug holes punched in this perimeter. Its total losses in the China campaign, from its initial invasion in 1937 to its surrender in 1945, approached 500,000. (The Chinese lost as many as ten million. Historians disagree regarding how many millions of people were displaced by the war.) An attempted Japanese invasion of India beginning in March 1944 was called off after massive losses in July 1944. Because Prime Minister Hideki Tojo was the face of the war party both abroad and at home, it seemed clear that no peace settlement with the Allies was conceivable if he were in power. Therefore, in July 1944, having lost the support of the emperor for the failure of his strategies, Tojo was forced to resign.

日本军队在太平洋上犯下了许多错误。早期夺取阿留申群岛部分地区的尝试失败了。 1942年和1943年 间，日本本土的防御周线不断重新划定。日本在没有重新评估其战略的情况下，就从中国调集兵力来 填补防御周线中的漏洞。从1937年首次入侵到1945年投降，其在中国战役中的总损失接近50万人。 （中国损失了多达 1000 万人。对于有多少万人因战争而流离失所，历史学家们意见不一。） 日本于 1944 年 3 月开始入侵印度，但在 1944 年 7 月损失惨重后，计划被取消。 由于首相东条英机在国内外都是战党的代表，因此，如果他掌权，显然不可能与盟国达 成和平协议。因此，1944年7月，东条因策略失败而失去了天皇的支持，被迫辞职。

The western Allied powers hoped China could play a major role in defeating the Axis powers. To that end, Chiang Kai-shek was invited to a conference in Cairo along with other Allied leaders in 1943. In the last phase of the war, Chinese forces were able to advance through Burma and reopen the major road between China and India. Further offensives took back other Japanese-held territory. By the end of the war, China had reclaimed all the land Japan had occupied and emerged as a significant country in world affairs.

西方 同盟国希望中国在击败轴心国方面发挥重要作用。为此，蒋介石与其他盟军领导人于 1943 年受邀参加 在开罗举行的会议。在战争的最后阶段，中国军队得以挺进缅甸，重新开辟了中印之间的主要道路。 进一步的攻势夺回了日本控制的其他领土。战争结束时，中国收复了日本占领的全部土地，并成为世 界事务中的重要国家。

As Japan moved through Southeast Asia, it promised the inhabitants that it ultimately supported independent governments there. In fact, new governments were established in Vietnam, Burma, and other places, and though they were always clearly under the thumb of the Japanese military, there was some optimism that “Asia for Asians” might prove to truly work. 当日本穿越东南亚时，它向当地居民承诺，它最终将支持那里的独立政府。事实上，越南、缅甸等地 都成立了新政府，尽管它们始终明显处于日本军方的控制之下，但人们乐观地认为“亚洲人的亚洲”可能 会真正发挥作用

In many ways, however, the colonial experience continued for these areas, because their natural resources were simply redirected to the Japanese government’s needs rather than to Europe’s. It became clear to many nationalists that they now had an enemy in the Japanese.

然而，在许多方面，这些地区的殖民经历仍在继续，因为它们的自然资源只是被用于满足日本政府的 需要，而不是欧洲的需要。许多民族主义者清楚地意识到，他们现在 的敌人是日本人。

The 1935 India Act had granted significant autonomy to the British provinces of India and introduced directly elected provincial assemblies. Fascism, communism, and nationalist desires for full independence all gained adherents among Indians beginning to more fully engage in politics. The political parties in India were either frustrated over broken British promises or anxious to see what rewards India might obtain for active and full support of Britain.

1935 年的《印度法案》赋予英国驻印度各省极大的自治权，并引入了直选的省议会。法西斯主义、共 产主义和民族主义对完全独立的渴望都在印度人中赢得了追随者，开始更充分地参与政治。印度各政 党要么因英国违背承诺而感到沮丧，要么急切地想知道印度因积极和全力支持英国而获得什么回报。

Meanwhile, by mid-1940, anti-British sentiments had begun to erupt across India. In August 1942, the Congress Party, the largest political party in India, granted leadership to the committed nationalist Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi and supported his nonviolent “Quit India” movement. Immediately the British arrested Gandhi and other Congress Party leaders and detained them through most of the war.

与此同时，到 1940 年中期，印度各地的反英情绪开始爆发。 1942 年 8 月，印度最大政党国大党授予坚定的民族主义者莫罕达斯·甘地领导权，并支持他的非暴力 “退出印度”运动。英国立即逮捕了甘地和其他国大党领导人，并在战争的大部分时间里将他们拘留。

Anti-Semitism had been an undercurrent in European history for centuries, and anti-Jewish propaganda and scapegoating began to surface after Germany’s defeat in World War I.

几个世纪以来，反犹太主义一直是欧洲 历史上的暗流，德国在第一 次世界大战中战败后，反犹太宣传和替罪羊开始浮出水面。

When the Wehrmacht streamed into Poland in 1939 and encountered the largest Jewish population in the world, the Nazis had the opportunity to begin the genocide known as the Holocaust on a huge scale. Special execution squads called the Einsatzgruppen (“operational groups”) followed the advancing German troops, killing enemies and undesirables—largely Jewish people. Jewish people were gathered in ghettoes for better control and subjected to forced labor. The largest was the Warsaw ghetto, which by 1941 housed 441,000 people. That same year, six major concentration camps were established, and railroad lines were built specifically to transport prisoners to them. There had been anti-Jewish pogroms (massacres) in Poland before the war, and some Polish citizens joined these German extermination activities.

1939 年，当国防军涌入波兰并遭遇世界上最多的犹太人口时，纳粹有机会开始大规模的种族灭绝，即 大屠杀。被称为特别行动小组（ Einsatzgruppen ）的特别处决小队跟随前进的德国军队，杀死敌人和 不受欢迎的人——主要是犹太人。犹太人被聚集在贫民区以获得更好的控制并遭受强迫劳动。最大的 是华沙隔都，到 1941 年已有 441,000 人居住。同年，建立了六个主要集中营，并修建了专门将囚犯运 送到集中营的铁路线。战前波兰曾发生过反犹大屠杀（屠杀），部分波兰公民也加入了德国的这些灭 绝活动。

Following Germany’s surrender in May 1945, a military court was convened in the city of Nuremberg to try Germans accused of war crimes.

(Ohlendorf, thirty-eight years of age, who was head of the Nazi agency in charge of intelligence and security, was found guilty of war crimes and executed.)

1945 年 5 月德国投降后，纽伦堡市成立了一个军事法庭，审判被指控犯有战争罪的德国人。

（奥伦多夫，三十八岁，纳粹负责情报和安全的机构负责人，被判犯有战争罪 并被处决。）

OHLENDORF: The instructions were that in the Russian operational areas of the Einsatzgruppen the Jews, as well as the Soviet political commissars, were to be liquidated.

奥伦多夫：接到的指示是，在俄罗斯特别行动队的行动区内，犹太人以及苏联政治委员 将被消灭。

OHLENDORF: In the year between June 1941 to June 1942 the Einsatzkommandos [men working for the Einsatzgruppen] reported ninety thousand people liquidated.

奥伦多夫：1941 年 6 月至 1942 年 6 月期间，特别行动队（为特别行动队工作的人 员）报告称有 9 万人被消灭。

COL. AMEN: On what pretext, if any, were they rounded up?

上校阿门：他们是以什么借口（如果有的话）被围捕的？

OHLENDORF: On the pretext that they were to be resettled.

奥伦多夫：借口是要重新安置他们。

The concentration camps were simultaneously labor and death camps. In January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference, the Final Solution to the “Jewish question” was discussed. It was decided that German state policy would be to eliminate European Jewish people by working them to death, starving them, or otherwise exterminating them. They were persecuted in place or sent to death camps.

集中营同时是劳工营和死亡营。1942年1月，万湖 会议讨论了“犹太人问题”的最终解决方案。会议决定，德国的国家政策是通过劳动致死、挨饿或以其他 方式消灭欧洲犹太人来消灭他们。他们被就地迫害或送往死亡营。

Auschwitz in western Poland was the largest of the death camps, originally constructed in 1940 to hold Polish political prisoners. It became a death camp in 1941 when Polish and Soviet prisoners were executed there. That same year, a new camp (known as Auschwitz II or Birkenau) was built nearby. Its main purpose was to kill Jewish people who were brought on freight trains from all over Europe. Other camps also existed at Auschwitz, including labor camps where prisoners worked for the chemical company I.G. Farben. Some 1.3 million people were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau before Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, ordered the camp closed and evacuated in January 1945 as the Soviet army rapidly advanced on it. Of these 1.3 million, 1.1 million would die there. The vast majority, nearly one million, were Jewish.

波兰西部的奥斯威辛集中营是最大的死亡营，最初建于 1940 年，用于关押波兰政治犯。 1941 年，波 兰和苏联囚犯被处决，这里成为死亡营。同年，附近建立了一个新营地（称为奥斯威辛二号或比克 瑙）。其主要目的是杀害从欧洲各地通过货运火车运来的犹太人。奥斯威辛集中营还存在其他营地， 包括囚犯为 IG Farben 化学公司工作的劳改营。 1945 年 1 月，随着苏联军队迅速向该集中营推进，党 卫军领导人海因里希·希姆莱(Heinrich Himmler) 下令关闭并疏散该集中营，在此之前，约有 130 万人 被送往奥斯威辛-比克瑙集中营。这130万人中，有110万人会死在那里。其中绝大多数（近百万）是犹 太人。

Other gas chambers were constructed at Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka in 1942, and arriving prisoners deemed unsuitable for work were usually sent almost directly to the “showers,” actually gas chambers. The systematic implementation of these policies required the collaboration of tens of thousands of people from across Europe, which culminated in the murder of more than six million Jewish people and at least three million members of other minority groups, including gay and Roma people, communists, socialists, and Jehovah’s Witnesses, before the war was over. Historians disagree about how many died in the camps, and the true number will likely never be known.

1942 年，贝尔热茨、索比堡和特雷布林卡还修建了其他毒气室，抵达后被认为不适合工作的囚犯通常 几乎直接被送往“淋浴室”，实际上是毒气室。这些政策的系统实施需要欧洲各地数万人的合作，最终导 致超过 600 万犹太人和至少 300 万其他少数群体成员被谋杀，其中包括同性恋者和罗姆人、共产主义 者、战争结束前，社会主义者和耶和华见证人。历史学家对于集中营内死亡人数的说法存在分歧，而 真正的数字可能永远不会为人所知。

There were many instances of resistance, such as the Warsaw ghetto uprising in 1943. This was ruthlessly crushed by the Germans, however, resulting in the deaths of thirteen thousand Jewish people. Unsuccessful uprisings also took place in three of the concentration camps, one of which, in Sobibor, perhaps saved some lives by forcing the closure of the camp. Beginning in 1942, Irena Sendler, a member of the Polish Underground Resistance, participated in the Great Action in the Warsaw ghetto to smuggle out Jewish children. She is credited with saving some 2,500 children before she was discovered. Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, ran a factory in Poland and worked to shield his Jewish workers from the Nazis, saving the lives of thousands. Loukas Karrer, the mayor of the Greek island Zakynthos, saved the island’s entire Jewish population of 275 by refusing to surrender them and then hiding them. In Bulgaria, Dimitar Peshev, the deputy speaker of the National Assembly, had supported anti-Semitic legislation, but he refused to accept the German request to deport forty-eight thousand Jews and got the government to rescind the order.

反抗的例子很多，比如1943年的华沙隔都起义，但遭到德国人的残酷镇压，导致一万三千名犹太人死 亡。三个集中营也发生了不成功的起义，其中一个位于索比堡的集中营通过强制关闭集中营也许挽救 了一些生命。 1942年开始，波兰地下抵抗组织成员伊雷娜·森德勒参加了华沙隔都的大行动，偷运犹太 儿童。在她被发现之前，她被认为拯救了大约 2,500 名儿童。纳粹党成员奥斯卡·辛德勒在波兰经营一 家工厂，致力于保护犹太工人免受纳粹的侵害，拯救了数千人的生命。希腊扎金索斯岛的市长卢卡斯· 卡勒(Loukas Karrer) 拒绝交出并隐藏了岛上 275 名犹太人，从而拯救了他们。在保加利亚，国民议会 副议长迪米塔尔·佩舍夫曾支持反犹太立法，但他拒绝接受德国驱逐四万八千名犹太人的要求，并要求 政府撤销该命令

Those left behind on the home front during the war followed the fates of their absent loved ones wherever they were. They often coped with shortages of needed items and new workloads as the conflict continued year after year. Research also continued at home as the countries engaged in the war sought to gain an advantage over one another. As a result, new technologies and scientific understandings emerged that affected not only the war and its outcome but the postwar global society as well.

战争期间留在后方的人们无论身在何处，都追随着不在身边的亲人的命运。随着冲突年复一年地持 续，他们常常要应对所需物品的短缺和新的工作量。随着参战国家寻求相互竞争的优势，国内研究也 在继续进行。结果，新技术和科学认识的出现不仅影响了战争及其结果，也影响了战后的全球社会。

For European countries in World War II, the distance between the battlefield and the home front was often very short or nonexistent. Total war, fought using all available resources with no restrictions on weapons or their targets, took the conflict to millions.

对于二战中的欧洲国家来说，战场与后方的距离往往很短，甚至根本不存在。全面战争是利用一切可 用资源进行的，对武器或目标没有任何限制，导致数百万人陷入冲突。

Partisan resistance groups sprang up, the largest among the Dutch, the French, the Polish, the Soviets, and the Yugoslavs. On December 7, 1941, Hitler responded to this resistance with his “Night and Fog Decree” in which he stated that people threatening German security should disappear into the night and fog. Consequently, thousands of brutal reprisals for resistance were visited on local populations.

In the Netherlands, railroad workers went on strike in support of Allied offensives in the winter of 1944, and the Germans retaliated by cutting off their food supplies, leading to thirty thousand deaths by starvation.

游击队抵抗团体如雨后春笋般涌现，其中最大的是荷兰人、法国人、波兰人、苏联人和南斯拉夫人。 1941年12月7日，希特勒以《夜雾法令》回应这种抵抗，他在法令中表示，威胁德国安全的人应该消失 在夜色和雾中。结果，当地民众因抵抗而遭受了数以千计的残酷报复。1944年冬天，荷兰铁路工人举行罢工，支持盟军进 攻，德国人则以切断他们的粮食供应作为报复，导致三万人饿死。

Since most resources were funneled toward the Germans and away from local populations, much of Europe had to solve the problems of food shortages, rationing, and black markets.

In Norway, the country lost all its foreign trade partners, and its entire economy became tilted toward Germany. The result was that only about 40 percent of Norwegian production was left for consumption by Norwegians, necessitating rationing

由于大部分资源都流向了德国人而不是当地居民，欧洲大部分地区必须解决粮食短缺、配 给和黑市的问题。在挪威，该国失去了所有的对外贸易伙伴，整个经济向德国倾斜。结果是，挪威的产量只有约 40% 供挪威人消费，因此需要配给

Where economies were less modern, it was difficult to increase production. Laborers were lost, either through death or because they were sent to Germany to work. As many as twelve million forced laborers from twenty different countries, mostly in eastern and central Europe, fell under German control, further depressing the production of civilian goods. Despite German hopes, eastern Europe exported to Germany only 800,000 tons of bread over the course of the war, and hunger and starvation became common experiences for resident populations. In Greece, the appropriation of foodstuffs led to a famine that killed a quarter of a million people in the winter of 1941–1942, including 90 percent of the babies born.

在经济不太现代化的地方，很难增加产量。劳工流失，要么是因为死亡，要么是因为他们被派往德国 工作。来自二十个不同国家（主要是东欧和中欧）的多达一千二百万强迫劳工落入德国的控制之下， 进一步抑制了民用产品的生产。尽管德国抱有希望，但东欧在战争期间仅向德国出口了80万吨面包， 饥饿和饥荒成为居民的普遍经历。在希腊，对食品的侵占导致了 1941 年至 1942 年冬季 25 万人死亡 的饥荒，其中包括 90% 的婴儿。

The Germans instituted a four-year economic plan in 1936, and rationing began in August 1939. The first few years of the war brought little change in their standard of living, but by early 1945, rationing had grown uncomfortably tight. The Italians too had to adjust to rationing, which began in 1939 and progressively diminished the standard of living. In 1943, major labor strikes took place in protest against these measures in Italy, even in war-related industries. In the Soviet Union, the loss of Ukraine and other grain-producing areas necessitated strict rationing. China’s agricultural economy had been severely disrupted by the Japanese invasion in the 1930s, and the war did little to improve the situation. Food shortages in Japan were severe, and by 1944, the population was surviving on eight ounces of rice a day.

德国人于 1936 年制定了四年经济 计划，并于 1939 年 8 月开始配给。战争的头几年几乎没有给他们的生活水平带来什么变化，但到 1945 年初，配给已经变得令人不安。意大利人也必须适应 1939 年开始的配给制，并逐渐降低了生活 水平。 1943年，意大利发生了大规模的工人罢工，抗议这些措施，甚至在与战争相关的行业也是如 此。在苏联，乌克兰和其他粮食产区的丧失使得严格的配给成为必要。中国的农业经济在20世纪30年 代因日本侵略而受到严重破坏，而战争对改善这一状况并没有起到什么作用。日本的粮食短缺严重， 到 1944 年，人们每天靠八盎司大米生存。

Rationing was a fact of life in Allied countries as well. In Britain in 1939, oil and gasoline were rationed first, then a year later foods such as bacon, butter, meat, cheese, and eggs were rationed. In the United States, the Office of Price Administration had been established in August 1941. It commenced rationing sugar, meat, butter, gasoline, tires, and canned goods three weeks after Pearl Harbor.

在同盟国，配给也是一个现实。 1939年，英国首先实行石油和汽油配给，一年后，培根、黄油、肉 类、奶酪和鸡蛋等食品也实行配给。 在美国，价格管理办公室于 1941 年 8 月成立。它在珍珠港事件发生三周后开始对糖、肉类、黄 油、汽油、轮胎和罐头食品进行配给。

Many nations sent their children abroad to safer areas. During the blitz of London, one million British children were evacuated to the countryside or to Canada. By 1942, the Germans, the Soviets, and the Japanese had sent hundreds of thousands of children out of their major cities, and sometimes their civilian parents as well.

许多国家将他们的孩子送到国外更安全的地区。在伦敦闪电战期间，一百万英国儿童被疏散到乡村或 加拿大。到 1942 年，德国、苏联和日本已将数十万儿童送出各自的大城市，有时还送走了他们的平民 父母。

The governments of nearly all the combatants sooner or later assumed command of their economies to direct labor and resources to their war efforts. As early as the mid-1920s, the Italian government had begun direct intervention in the economy, and by 1939, Italy had the secondhighest percentage of state-owned enterprises in the world; only the Soviet Union had more. The Soviets had instituted state control and a centrally commanded economy in 1928 with the goal of industrializing rapidly. When the Germans attacked, about a third of the western portion of the nation, with most of the Soviet industrial base, fell into German hands. In anticipation of a conflict with capitalist nations, the Soviets had begun to establish industrial bases east of the Ural Mountains. During World War II, they intensified their efforts to save their industrial centers and moved twenty-five hundred factories and twenty-five million people east of the Urals, out of reach of the Wehrmacht.

几乎所有参战国的政府迟早都会掌握其经济的指挥权，将劳动力和资源用于战争。早在20年代中期， 意大利政府就开始直接干预经济，到1939年，意大利国有企业比例位居世界第二；只有苏联拥有更 多。苏联于 1928 年建立了国家控制和中央指挥的经济，其目标是迅速工业化。当德国人进攻时，该国 西部约三分之一的地区以及苏联大部分工业基地落入德国人手中。由于预见到与资本主义国家发生冲 突，苏联开始在乌拉尔山脉以东建立工业基地。第二次世界大战期间，他们加大了拯救工业中心的力 度，将 2500 家工厂和 2500 万人迁移到乌拉尔山脉以东，远离国防军的控制范围。

The Japanese shifted to turning out planes to defend the nation from air attacks, and work on battleships and cruisers ceased altogether.

日本人转而生产飞机来保卫国家免受空袭，战列舰和巡洋舰的建 造工作完全停止。

Government efforts to spur production led to nearly full employment in many nations. In the United States, unemployment dropped from 15 percent in 1939 to 1 percent in 1943 as seventeen million new civilian jobs were created. All these changes transformed the human landscape as workers from across the United States, and increasingly women and African Americans from the south, were drawn into defense industry work. Half the world’s war production came from the United States. The Lend-Lease program sent material and foodstuffs to forty Allied nations, mainly Britain and the Soviet Union.

政府刺激生产的努力导致许多国家几乎充分就业。在美国，失业率从 1939 年的 15% 下降到 1943 年 的 1%，创造了 1700 万个新的平民就业岗位。所有这 些变化都改变了人类的面貌，来自美国各地的工人以及越来越多的来自南方的女性和非裔美国人被吸 引到国防工业工作中。世界上一半的战争生产来自美国。租借计划向四十个盟国运送了物资和食品， 其中主要是英国和苏联，

Total war meant that the enemy’s productive capabilities were fair targets for destruction. While the air raids on Britain often targeted civilian locations, the Allies initially attempted a program of strategic bombing of Axis locations in Europe. The plan was to disrupt industrial production, though reality often fell short of this goal. The Royal Air Force conducted nighttime bombing campaigns over German cities, similar to those Germany carried out over England. The multiday attacks on Dresden by more than one thousand British and U.S. bombers in February 1945 dropped high explosives and firebombs on the center of the city, destroying most of it and killing more than twenty-five thousand people.

全面战争意味着敌人的生产能力是被摧毁的合理目标。虽然对英国的空袭经常针对平民地点，但盟军 最初尝试了对欧洲轴心国地点进行战略轰炸的计划。该计划旨在扰乱工业生产，但现实往往达不到这 一目标。。英国皇家空军对德国城市进行了夜间轰炸，类似于德国对英 格兰进行的轰炸。 1945 年 2 月，一千多架英国和美国轰炸机对德累斯顿进行了多日袭击，向市中心投 掷了烈性炸药和燃烧弹，摧毁了大部分城市，造成两万五千多人死亡。

The danger air raids posed to civilians was clear. Air raids killed 60,000 British people and injured 86,000 during the Battle of Britain. Nationwide German wartime losses reached 305,000 killed and 800,000 injured, with five million rendered homeless. The Allied bombing of Japan was severe as well. The U.S. Air Force destroyed sixty-nine Japanese cities. The March 1945 raid on Tokyo alone killed between 80,000 and 100,000 people and destroyed the homes of a million more. By 1945, Japan was on the verge of economic collapse.

空袭对平民造成的危险是显而易见的。不列颠之战期间，空袭造成 60,000 名英国人死亡，86,000 人受 伤。德国全国战时损失达 305,000 人死亡、800,000 人受伤，其中 500 万人无家可归。盟军对日本的 轰炸也很严重。美国空军摧毁了六十九个日本城市。仅 1945 年 3 月对东京的空袭就造成 80,000 至 100,000 人死亡，并摧毁了 100 万人的房屋。到了1945年，日本正处于经济崩溃的边缘。

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about the Japanese, and it was generally feared that Japanese Americans living in the United States might engage in espionage or sabotage. Executive Order 9066, issued by President Roosevelt in February 1942, authorized West Coast military commanders to exclude from designated military areas anyone deemed a threat to national security. It thus allowed the widespread forced relocation of tens of thousands of Japanese and Japanese American families into ten relocation camps administered by the War Relocation Authority from 1942 until 1946.

日本对珍珠港的袭击引发了一系列针对日本人的种族主义假设，人们普遍担心居住在美国的日裔美国 人可能会从事间谍活动或破坏活动。罗斯福总统于 1942 年 2 月发布的第 9066 号行政命令授权西海岸 军事指挥官将任何被视为对国家安全构成威胁的人排除在指定军事区域之外。因此，从 1942 年到 1946 年，数以万计的日本人和日裔美国人家庭被强制搬迁到战时搬迁管理局管理的 10 个搬迁营中

The internees at these camps, many of them U.S. citizens, were forced to abandon their homes and businesses, and most never recovered them. Conditions in the camps were bleak. Families were separated, and men were often sent to different locations for investigation and interrogation.

这些营地中的被拘留者（其中许多是美国公民）被迫放弃家园和企业，而且大多数人从未恢复过它 们。难民营的条件十分恶劣。家庭被离散，男子经常被送往不同地点接受调查和审讯。

In 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the relocation, but in the early 1980s, the federal court system reconsidered the issue. In 1988, the U.S. government formally apologized to the people who had been interned and awarded $20,000 in reparations to each survivor.

1944年，美国最高法院维持了搬迁的合宪性，但在20世纪80年代初，联邦法院系统重新考虑了这一问 题。1988年，美国政 府正式向被拘留者道歉，并向每位幸存者提供2万美元的赔偿。

While most Latin American countries did not participate in combat in the war (Brazil was an exception), none could avoid the harsh realities of the conflict. Some areas saw increased economic opportunity at home, such as Panama, where the canal had become extremely busy during the war as goods were transferred from ocean to ocean.

尽管大多数拉美国家没有参加战争（巴西是个例外），但没有一个国家能够避免冲突的残酷现实。一些地区的国内经济机会有所增加，例如巴拿马，战争期间，随着货物从一个海洋转移 到另一个海洋，巴拿马运河变得异常繁忙。

Along with becoming a theater of battle in its northern lands, Africa was also drawn into World War II when Africans were enlisted into the armies fighting fascism. More than a million African soldiers fought in Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific or provided labor for colonial forces during the war. Most were forcibly recruited and paid far less than White European soldiers. The colonial holdings of the European powers throughout the continent meant that Africa’s resources were available for the war effort. Many Africans saw their loyal contribution to the Allies as a down payment for greater self-determination and independence after the war.

随着非洲成为其北部土地的战场，非洲也被卷入第二次世界大战，非洲人被征召入伍对抗法西斯主 义。战争期间，超过一百万非洲士兵在欧洲、北非、东南亚和太平洋地区作战或为殖民军队提供劳动 力。大多数人是被强行征召入伍的，而且报酬远低于欧洲白人士兵。欧洲列强在整个非洲大陆的殖民 地意味着非洲的资源可用于战争。许多非洲人将他们对同盟国的忠诚贡献视为战后获得更大自决和独立的首付。

Japanese history textbooks, which must be approved by the Ministry of Education, largely ignore the existence of the comfort women and have downplayed or denied the role of the Japanese military in forcing civilians on the island of Okinawa to commit suicide rather than surrender after the U.S. victory there in March 1945.

。日 本历史教科书必须经过教育部批准，但在很大程度上忽视了慰安妇的存在，并且淡化或否认 了日本军队在美国投降后强迫冲绳岛平民自杀而不是投降的过程中所扮演的角色。 1945 年 3 月在那里取得胜利。

World War II, like World War I, brought about scientific and technological developments that soon became matters of life and death. The nature of total war itself prompted a transformation in the relationship between states and scientists. Governments invested in the development of lethal and nonlethal technologies that ultimately became essential to the war and national security. In the fall of 1939, the British scientific community rapidly shifted its focus from matters of pure research to work aiding the war effort.

与第一次世界大战一样，第二次世界大战带来的科学技术发展很快就成为生死攸关的问题。全面战争 本身的性质促使国家与科学家之间的关系发生转变。各国政府投资于致命和非致命技术的开发，这些 技术最终对战争和国家安全至关重要。 1939 年秋天，英国科学界迅速将注意力从纯粹的研究转向支持 战争的工作。

Allied efforts to break the Nazi spy codes inspired the birth of the first rudimentary computers.

盟军破译纳粹间谍密码的努力激发了第一台基本计算机的诞生。

In December 1938, German physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann accidentally split atoms and discovered nuclear fission.

1938年12月，德国物理学 家奥托·哈恩和弗里茨·斯特拉斯曼意外分裂了原子并发现了核裂变

By the late 1930s, British and other scientists became convinced that an atomic bomb was possible, and teams of physicists, some of them refugees from Nazi Germany, assembled and began experiments with nuclear chain reactions, the catalysts of an atomic explosion. In August 1942, the U.S. government boosted this effort with its top-secret Manhattan Project. At dozens of sites across the United States, from Los Alamos in New Mexico to Oak Ridge in Tennessee and Hanford in Washington State, 600,000 workers embarked on a frenetic race to build the world’s first atomic bomb. Meanwhile, Germany and Japan were also attempting to build their own. The German effort was hindered by technical and other problems. For example, top German scientists had fled Germany, and some were assisting the Manhattan Project. Further, Hitler preferred to support the development of V2 bombers for the air war with England rather than an atomic bomb. In 1941, the Japanese commissioned physicist Yoshio Nishina to begin working on an atomic bomb, calling the project Ni-Go. But lacking any information shared by the Germans and suffering under successful U.S. air raids, the project did not make much progress.

到了 20 世纪 30 年代末，英国和其他国家的科学家开始相信原子弹是可能实现的，物理学家组成的团 队（其中一些是纳粹德国的难民）聚集起来并开始了核链式反应（原子爆炸的催化剂）的实验。 1942 年 8 月，美国政府通过绝密的曼哈顿计划加强了这一努力。从新墨西哥州的洛斯阿拉莫斯到田纳西州 的橡树岭和华盛顿州的汉福德，在美国各地的数十个地点，600,000 名工人开始了制造世界上第一颗原 子弹的疯狂竞赛。与此同时，德国和日本也试图建立自己的。德国的努力受到技术和其他问题的阻 碍。例如，德国顶尖科学家纷纷逃离德国，其中一些正在协助曼哈顿计划。此外，希特勒更愿意支持 开发用于与英国空战的 V2 轰炸机，而不是原子弹。 1941 年，日本委托物理学家仁科良夫开始研究原 子弹，将该项目称为 Ni-Go。但由于缺乏德国人分享的任何信息，并且受到美国成功空袭的影响，该项 目并没有取得太大进展。

Eventually, in July 1945, the Manhattan Project bore fruit, and a bomb was successfully detonated in the Trinity Test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. William L. Laurence, the official historian of the project, described this first successful trial of an atomic weapon: “On that moment hung eternity. Time stood still. Space contracted to a pinpoint. It was as though the earth had opened and the skies split. One felt as though they had been privileged to witness the Birth of the World—to be present at the moment of Creation when the Lord Said: Let there be light.” President Roosevelt had died suddenly in April 1945, succeeded by Vice President Harry S. Truman. It fell to Truman to decide whether to use the new weapon or not.

最终，1945年7月，曼哈顿计划取得了成果，一枚炸弹在新墨西哥州阿拉莫戈多的三位一体测试中成功 引爆。该项目的官方历史学家威廉·L·劳伦斯 (William L. Laurence) 描述了原子武器的首次成功试验： “那一刻是永恒的。时间静止了。空间收缩到了一个点。仿佛大地裂开，天空裂开。人们感觉自己好像 有幸见证了世界的诞生——在创世的那一刻，当主说：要有光时，他们就在场。” 1945 年 4 月，罗斯 福总统突然去世，副总统哈里·S·杜鲁门继任。是否使用这种新武器由杜鲁门决定。

Just as it did after World War I, immense hope prevailed after World War II that genuine and lasting peace might arise. The future of the globe itself seemed to hang in the balance if humans could not avoid using violence to solve their problems.

正如第一次世界大战后一样，第二次世界大战后人们普遍抱有巨大的希望，认为真正持久的和平可能 会出现。。如果人类无法避免使用暴力来解决问题，那么地球本身的未来似乎就悬而未决

For more than five years after they met in Newfoundland and produced the Atlantic Charter’s plan for the end of the conflict, Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged more than 1,700 letters and messages and held many high-level meetings to closely coordinate their efforts at every level. At a specialized conference held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, representatives of forty-four Allied countries together hammered out the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund, both intended to secure economic security and stability after the war.

罗斯福和丘吉尔在纽芬兰会面并制定了《大西洋宪章》结束冲突的计划，五年多来，他们交换了 1,700 多封信件和电文，并举行了许多高层会议，密切协调各个层面的努力。 1944年，在新罕布什尔州布雷 顿森林举行的一次专门会议上，44个盟国的代表共同敲定了国际复兴开发银行和国际货币基金组织， 旨在确保战后的经济安全和稳定。

As Allied troops marched toward the German border, however, their coalition began to fray. On a visit to Stalin late in 1944, Churchill signed the Percentages Agreement in which the two decided to divide up eastern Europe into spheres of influence, with Britain getting a 90 percent share of Greece, the USSR getting 90 percent of Romania, and both holding 50 percent of the political power in Hungary and Yugoslavia. Churchill thought Stalin should burn the document afterward because “it might be thought rather cynical if it seemed we had disposed of these issues, so fateful to millions of people, in such an offhand manner.”

然而，当盟军向德国边境进军时，他们的联盟开始出现冲突。 1944年底，丘吉尔在访问斯大林时签署 了《百分比协议》 ，双方决定将东欧划分为势力范围，英国获得希腊90%的份额，苏联获得罗马尼亚 90%的份额，双方都拥有匈牙利和南斯拉夫50%的政治权力。丘吉尔认为斯大林应该在事后烧掉这份 文件，因为“如果我们以如此不经意的方式处理了这些对数百万人来说至关重要的问题，可能会被认为 是相当愤世嫉俗的。”

Finally, several months after the Soviet victory at Kursk, General Eisenhower prepared to open a second front in the European theater of the war. By May 1944, the German military was facing a dilemma. The Soviet Red Army was relentlessly rolling back German positions in the east, and it seemed obvious that the British and U.S. troops were preparing for an invasion of the continent. Given the brutality of the battles on the eastern front, the Germans chose to retain 228 divisions to counter the Soviets and assigned the defense of Europe to fifty-eight divisions, only fifteen of which were in the vicinity of Normandy, France.

最后，苏联在库尔斯克取得胜利几个月后，艾森豪威尔将军准备在欧洲战区开辟第二条战线。到1944 年5月，德国军队面临两难境地。苏联红军正无情地击退德军在东部的阵地，英美军队显然正在为入侵 欧洲大陆做准备。鉴于东线战斗的残酷性，德军选择保留228个师来对抗苏联，并将欧洲的防御任务分 配给58个师，其中只有15个师位于法国诺曼底附近。

Normandy, however, was the secret site of the coming invasion. After months of assembling and training troops, the Allies began their invasion of France at 2 a.m. on June 6, 1944—D-Day. Having assumed responsibility for nearly every detail but not convinced he had done enough, Eisenhower wrote a letter of resignation the night before in case things did not go well. But they did. By the second day of the operation, approximately 160,000 Allied troops with considerable armor were linking up in a continuous line through Europe and punching holes in German defenses. Paris was liberated just two months later.

然而，诺曼底是即将到来的入侵的秘密地点。经过几个月的集结和训练部队，盟军于 1944 年 6 月 6 日 诺曼底登陆日凌晨 2 点开始入侵法国。艾森豪威尔承担了几乎所有细节的责任，但不相信自己做得足 够，因此在前一天晚上写了一封辞职信，以防事情进展不顺利。但他们做到了。到行动第二天，大约 160,000 名拥有大量装甲的盟军部队在整个欧洲连成一线，不断突破德军的防御。仅仅两个月后，巴黎 就获得了解放。

A race to capture Berlin then began, with Allied generals vying for the honor of getting there first. As British and U.S. troops approached from the west, the Soviets closed in on the city from the east.

随后，一场攻占柏林的竞赛开始了，盟军将军们争夺第一个占领柏林的荣誉。当英美军队从西边逼近 时，苏联人从东边逼近这座城市。

With the conflict nearing its end, the Big Three met again to plan the peace at the Yalta Conference in the Soviet Crimea from February 4 to 11, 1945. Roosevelt’s agenda asked for Soviet support in the U.S. Pacific War against Japan, specifically in invading Japan. He also hoped for support for the creation of a new institution—the United Nations—that would be modeled on the premise of collective security but would be a stronger body than the League of Nations had been. Churchill pressed for free elections and democratic governments in eastern and central Europe (specifically Poland), while Stalin demanded a Soviet sphere of political influence in eastern and central Europe.

随着冲突接近尾声，三巨头于1945年2月4日至11日在苏联克里米亚举行的雅尔塔会议上再次会面，谋 划和平。罗斯福的议程要求苏联支持美国对日本的太平洋战争，特别是入侵日本。他还希 望获得支持建立一个新机构——联合国——该机构将以集体安全为前提，但比国际联盟更强大。丘吉 尔敦促东欧和中欧（特别是波兰）实行自由选举和民主政府，而斯大林则要求苏联在东欧和中欧拥有 政治影响力。(在达成每个人的这些想法之前，需要用人命堆出有利于自己的形势，才能因势利导。如果不需要形势来支撑自己，那每个人对世界的规划都能迅速实现，这个世界社会就会变化很快。犹如在计算机模拟游戏中快速迭代一样。)

Stalin promised free elections in Poland, despite having recently installed a government in Polish territories occupied by the Red Army. His preconditions for the Soviet Union’s declaring war against Japan were U.S. recognition of Mongolian independence from China and of Soviet interests in the Manchurian railways and Port Arthur. These were agreed upon without Chinese representation or consent, and Stalin promised that the Soviet Union would enter the Pacific War three months after the defeat of Germany. Roosevelt met Stalin’s price in the hope that the USSR could be dealt with after the war via the United Nations, which the Soviets had agreed to join.

斯大林承诺在波兰举行自由选举，尽管最近在红军占领的波兰领土上建立了政府。他对苏联向日本宣 战的先决条件是美国承认蒙古从中国独立以及苏联在满洲铁路和旅顺口的利益。这些协议是在没有中 国代表或同意的情况下达成的，斯大林承诺苏联将在德国战败三个月后加入太平洋战争。罗斯福满足 了斯大林的条件，希望战后可以通过联合国来对付苏联，而苏联也同意加入联合国。

In the Declaration on Liberated Europe, the three leaders agreed that all original governments would be restored in the invaded countries (except France, Romania, and Bulgaria and the Polish government-in-exile in London), and that all displaced civilians would be repatriated. Other key points of the meeting were reaffirmation of the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, and of the division of Germany and Berlin into three occupied zones (later expanded to four).

在《解放欧洲宣言》中，三位领导人同意，所有被入侵国家恢复原来的政府（法国、罗马尼亚、保加 利亚和位于伦敦的波兰流亡政府除外），并遣返所有流离失所的平民。 。会议的其他要点包括重申纳 粹德国无条件投降，以及将德国和柏林划分为三个占领区（后来扩大到四个）。

Germany was to undergo demilitarization and denazification and make reparations, partly in the form of forced labor by German prisoners of war and others who would work in agricultural and industrial roles in both Eastern and Western Europe after the war. At the same time, Nazi war criminals were to be hunted down and brought to justice. Stalin insisted that given the pain and destruction the Germans had visited upon the Soviet Union, reparations ought to go to the nation that had suffered the most. Resolution of this issue was postponed to a future conference. After Yalta, Eisenhower conferred with Moscow and laid out a plan, adhering to the Yalta Agreement, for the exact placement of the postwar occupation zones in Berlin. Eisenhower knew the German leaders were preparing to move to another city, making Berlin of only psychlogical significance.

德国将经历非军事化和去纳粹化并进行赔偿，部分形式是德国战俘和其他战后在东欧和西欧从事农业 和工业工作的人进行强迫劳动。与此同时，纳粹战犯将被追捕并绳之以法。斯大林坚持认为，鉴于德 国人给苏联带来的痛苦和破坏，赔偿应该给予受害最严重的国家。该问题的解决被推迟到未来的会 议。雅尔塔会议后，艾森豪威尔与莫斯科协商，并根据《雅尔塔协议》制定了一项计划，以明确战后 柏林占领区的位置。艾森豪威尔知道德国领导人正准备迁往另一个城市，使柏林仅具有心理意义。

On April 30, 1945, Hitler and his wife of one day, Eva Braun, committed suicide. Various German commanders then began surrendering to Soviet or Allied forces. Hermann Göring surrendered on May 6, and the next day the chief of staff of German forces, General Alfred Jodl, unconditionally surrendered all German forces. Victory in Europe had been achieved.

1945 年 4 月 30 日，希特勒和他的妻子爱娃·布劳恩 (Eva Braun) 自杀。随后，许多德国指挥官开始向 苏联或盟军投降。赫尔曼·戈林于 5 月 6 日投降，第二天德军参谋长阿尔弗雷德·约德尔将军无条件投降 了所有德军。欧洲的胜利已经取得。

Advancing Soviet armies had begun the process of liberating the death camps in July 1944, and in January 1945, they freed those held in Auschwitz. In April, U.S. and British units liberated Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, and Dachau. To make sure the world became aware of German inhumanity, Eisenhower arranged for American and British reporters to tour the camps as well.

先进的苏联军队于 1944 年 7 月开始解放死亡集中营，并于 1945 年 1 月释放了奥斯威辛集中营的囚 犯。 4 月，美国和英国军队解放了布痕瓦尔德集中营、贝尔根-贝尔森集中营和达豪集中营。为了确保全世界了解德国的不人道行为，艾森豪威尔还安排美国和英 国记者参观集中营。

Throughout the war, the Japanese had believed that high casualties would dishearten U.S. troops, who they felt could not tolerate suffering and loss. On Iwo Jima, the Japanese sacrificed twenty-one thousand soldiers and inflicted twenty-six thousand casualties on U.S. Marines (seven thousand were killed and the rest wounded). But the U.S. troops persisted and again absorbed high casualties as they later captured Okinawa. Japan’s struggle for Okinawa included the use of the island’s civilians, resulting in the death of 100,000 and demonstrating the resolve to be expected from the Japanese in defense of their main islands.

在整个战争期间，日本人一直认为高伤亡会让美军灰心丧气，他们认为美军无法忍受痛苦和损失。在 硫磺岛上，日军牺牲了两万一千名士兵，造成两万六千名美国海军陆战队员伤亡（七千人死亡，其余 受伤）。但美军坚持不懈，并在后来占领冲绳岛时再次造成大量人员伤亡。日本对冲绳的争夺包括利 用该岛平民，导致 10 万人死亡，并显示了日本人保卫其主要岛屿的决心

In the face of such near-fanatical defensive efforts, U.S. secretary of war Henry L. Stimson and General George C. Marshall, the U.S. Army chief of staff, estimated that an invasion of Japan could cost between 500,000 and one million U.S. casualties and last well into 1946. Japan’s leaders, however, refused to consider an unconditional surrender that, among other things, may have led to the emperor’s being tried for war crimes. They came to the conclusion that an invasion of the home islands was inevitable.

面对这种近乎狂热的防御努力，美国战争部长亨利·L· 史汀生和美国陆军参谋长乔治·C·马歇尔将军估计，入侵日本可能会造成 50 万至 100 万美军伤亡，最 后一直到 1946 年。然而，日本领导人拒绝考虑无条件投降，这可能导致天皇因战争罪而受到审判。他们得出的结论 是，对本土岛屿的入侵是不可避免的。

Between July 17 and August 2, 1945, the final Allied summit conference took place at Potsdam, a suburb of Berlin. This time, Harry S. Truman replaced the late Franklin Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill was replaced by Britain’s newly elected prime minister Clement Attlee. Truman was already troubled by Soviet actions in Europe. He disliked the concessions Roosevelt had made that allowed the Soviets to install a communist government in Poland. He also disapproved of Stalin’s plans, made known at the Yalta Conference, to demand large reparations from Germany. Truman feared the resulting burden on Germany might lead to another cycle of rearmament and aggression.

1945年7月17日至8月2日，最后一次盟军首脑会议在柏林郊区波茨坦举行。这次，哈里·S·杜鲁门取代 了已故的富兰克林·罗斯福，温斯顿·丘吉尔则被英国新当选的首相克莱门特·艾德礼取代。杜鲁门已经对 苏联在欧洲的行动感到不安。他不喜欢罗斯福做出的让步，允许苏联在波兰建立共产主义政府。他还 反对斯大林在雅尔塔会议上提出的要求德国巨额赔偿的计划。杜鲁门担心由此给德国带来的负担可能 会导致新一轮重新武装和侵略的循环。

After issuing a demand for the unconditional surrender of Japan, the conference turned toward the fate of postwar Europe. The Allied leaders agreed to demilitarize Germany and to divide the conquered nation and its capital of Berlin into four occupation zones: three in the west to be controlled by Britain, France, and the United States, and one in the east for the USSR. An Allied Control Council was created to administer occupied Germany, though the choice to make the council’s decisions unanimous later proved unrealistic. The German economy was to be decentralized and focused on agriculture and nonmilitary industries.

在要求日本无条件投降后，会议转向了战后欧洲的命运。盟军领导人同意使德国非军事化，并将被征 服的国家及其首都柏林划分为四个占领区：西部的三个由英国、法国和美国控制，东部的一个由苏联 控制。成立了一个盟军控制委员会来管理被占领的德国，尽管后来证明让该委员会做出一致决定的选 择是不现实的。德国经济将分散化并集中于农业和非军事工业。

The debates about reparations stemming from the Yalta Conference were settled with a plan to exchange Germany’s western industrial production for its eastern agricultural production. In practice, however, this plan led to economic policies being instituted and managed by zones rather than for the nation as a whole, creating further disunity among the Allies. Finally, a program of denazification for Germany and Austria was confirmed that included punishment of war criminals. The settlement of the final borders of Poland was postponed, but Britain and the United States agreed to the transfer of designated German territory to Poland.

雅尔塔会议引发的有关赔偿的争论最终以德国西部工业生产换取东部农业生产的计划得到解决。然 而，实际上，该计划导致经济政策由地区而非整个国家制定和管理，从而在盟国之间造成进一步的不 团结。最后，德国和奥地利的去纳粹化计划得到确认，其中包括惩罚战犯。波兰最终边界的确定被推 迟，但英国和美国同意将指定的德国领土移交给波兰。

Truman had known little about the Manhattan Project before becoming president and now relied on the advice of his experts.

杜鲁门在成为总统之前对曼哈顿计划知之甚少，现在依赖于专家的建议。

The bomb was used, first against Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and three days later on Nagasaki.

1945 年 8 月 6 日，这颗炸弹首先针对广岛，三天后又针对长崎，

A variety of factors likely influenced Truman in making his decision. The desire to save American lives perhaps played the greatest role. The desire to justify the expense of the Manhattan Project also likely influenced him. Some have suggested that Truman hoped to demonstrate to the Soviet Union the technological superiority of the United States. Others believe that a desire for revenge for Pearl Harbor also played a role. Some have suggested that a long history of anti-Asian sentiment in the United States made the use of the atomic bomb against Japan seem less horrific than its use against Europeans would have been.

多种因素可能影响杜鲁门做出决定。拯救美国人生命的愿望也许发挥了最大的作用。证明曼哈顿计划 的费用合理的愿望也可能影响了他。有人认为，杜鲁门希望向苏联展示美国的技术优势。其他人认 为，对珍珠港事件的报复也起到了一定作用。一些人认为，美国长期以来的反亚洲情绪使得对日本使 用原子弹似乎不像对欧洲人使用原子弹那么可怕。

When it became clear that the Manhattan Project had been successful, a panel of scientists led by Robert Oppenheimer, the project’s head, made recommendations about the weapon they had created in a report dated June 16, 1945.

当曼哈顿计划明显取得成功后，由该项目负责人罗伯特·奥本海默(Robert Oppenheimer) 领导 的一个科学家小组在 1945 年 6 月 16 日的一份报告中对他们制造的武器提出了建议。

The opinions of our scientific colleagues on the initial use of these weapons are not unanimous. We can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war.

）我们的科学同事对于这些武器的最初使用意见并不一致。我们 不能提出任何可能结束战争的技术演示

The war has to be brought speedily to a successful conclusion and attacks by atomic bombs may very well be an effective method of warfare. We feel, however, that such attacks on Japan could not be justified, at least not unless the terms which will be imposed after the war on Japan were made public in detail and Japan were given an opportunity to surrender.

战争必须尽快取得胜利，原子弹攻击很可能是一种有效的战争方法。然而，我们认为， 对日本的这种攻击是不合理的，至少除非详细公布对日战争后强加的条款，并给予日本 投降的机会。

If Japan still refused to surrender our nation might then, in certain circumstances, find itself forced to resort to the use of atomic bombs. Such a step, however, ought not to be made at any time without seriously considering the moral responsibilities which are involved.

如果日本仍然拒绝投降，那么，在某些情况下，我们的国家可能会被迫使用原子弹。但是，在没有认真考虑所涉及的道德责任之前，在任何时候都不应该采取这样的步骤。

The atomic bombs at our disposal represent only the first step in this direction, and there is almost no limit to the destructive power which will become available in the course of their future development. Thus a nation which sets the precedent of using these newly liberated forces of nature for purposes of destruction may have to bear the responsibility of opening the door to an era of devastation on an unimaginable scale.

。我们所拥有的原子弹只是朝这个方向迈出的 第一步，在其未来的发展过程中，其破坏力几乎是无限的。因此，一个开创了利用这些 新解放的自然力量进行破坏的先例的国家可能必须承担为一个规模难以想象的破坏时代 打开大门的责任。(犹如AI)

If after this war a situation is allowed to develop in the world which permits rival powers to be in uncontrolled possession of these new means of destruction, the cities of the United States as well as the cities of other nations will be in continuous danger of sudden annihilation. . . .

如果在这场战争之后，世界上出现一种情况，允许敌对国家不受控制地拥有这些新的破 坏手段，那么美国的城市以及其他国家的城市将持续面临突然爆发的危险。歼灭。 。 。 。

The added material strength which this lead gives to the United States brings with it the obligation of restraint and if we were to violate this obligation our moral position would be weakened in the eyes of the world and in our own eyes. It would then be more difficult for us to live up to our responsibility of bringing the unloosened forces of destruction under control.

这种领先地位给美国带来了额外的物质力量，同时也带来了克制的义务，如果我们违反 这一义务，我们的道德地位在世界和我们自己的眼中就会被削弱。那么我们就更难履行 我们的责任，控制未释放的破坏力量。

What are the points made by the two sides? Which do you think made the better argument?

双方有何观点？您认为哪一个提出了更好的论据？

If you had been President Truman, would you have ordered the bomb to be dropped? Why or why not?

如果你是杜鲁门总统，你会下令投下炸弹吗？为什么或为什么不呢？ (不迷信盲从领导人的选择. 每个领导人都有自己的选择, 正如每界美国总统, 都会在选举时提出自己的政策, 而不是照搬前人的政策, 因为前人的政策已被证明解决不了目前的国家问题. 不然你也不会被选举成新的国家领导人.)

Keeping the promise made at Yalta, after the bombing of Hiroshima, the Soviets broke their nonaggression pact with Japan and invaded Manchukuo and Korea, ending any hope that they might act as an intermediary in a negotiated settlement with the Allies. Japan surrendered shortly after.

，在广岛轰炸后，苏联履行了在雅尔塔做出的承诺，破坏了与日本的互不侵犯条约，入侵了 满洲国和朝鲜 (美国替他把重活累活干了, 苏联马上就开始抓紧抢夺胜利果实)。苏联可能充当与盟国谈判解决 问题的中间人的希望破灭了。不久日本就投降了

Germany had suffered 5.5 million military deaths and lost as many as three million civilians. Japan lost 2.1 million military and another million civilians. China’s military deaths can only be approximated but may have been as high as four million, with another sixteen million civilians. The United States and the United Kingdom emerged less battered, with 416,000 American and 384,000 British deaths. Soviet military deaths were estimated at 8.8 to 10.7 million, and more than thirteen million civilian deaths were attributed to the war.

(战争结束后)，德国有 550 万名军人死亡，多 达 300 万平民丧生。日本损失了 210 万军人和 100 万平民。中国的军人死亡人数只能估算，但可能高 达 400 万人，另有 1600 万名平民。美国和英国受到的打击较小，美国有 416,000 人死亡，英国有 384,000 人死亡。战争导致苏联军人 死亡人数估计为 8.8 至 1,070 万人，超过 1300 万平民死亡。

The right-wing dictatorships in Spain and Portugal, by staying out of the actual conflict, were able to avoid the reconstructive policies and action of the Allies.

西班牙和葡萄牙的右翼独裁政权通过不介入实际冲突，能够避免盟军的重建政策和行动。

The Soviets exacted retribution on the Germans largely by removing and transporting back to the Soviet Union virtually anything they considered useful to rebuilding their own industrial sector destroyed by the war. Thus, the Soviet occupation zone, which became the communist satellite of East Germany, was left with little to sustain itself. The western Allies, wanting relief from the burden of supporting destitute Germans and their largely destroyed economy, began to rebuild Germany’s industries in their occupation zones.

苏联对德国的报复主要是把他们认为有助于重建被战争摧毁的工业部门的几乎所有东西运回苏联。因 此，成为东德共产主义卫星国的苏联占领区几乎没有什么可以维持的了。西方盟国希望摆脱支持贫困 的德国人和其严重受损的经济的负担，开始在其占领区重建德国的工业。

Efforts were also made to establish some measure of justice via war crimes trials. In August 1945, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States agreed to create the International Military Tribunal to try Germans accused of committing war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity. The Nuremberg Trials sought justice for Germany’s crimes against humanity; they lasted through 1946. Twenty-two individuals and seven Nazi organizations were indicted. Nineteen defendants were convicted and received sentences ranging from fifteen years in prison to death by hanging. Three of the Nazi organizations were ruled to be criminal organizations.

还努力通过战争罪审判建立某种程度的正义。 1945年8月，英国、苏联和美国同意成立国际军事法 庭，审判被指控犯有战争罪、危害和平罪和反人类罪的德国人。纽伦堡审判为德国反人类罪寻求正 义；他们一直持续到 1946 年。有 22 个人和 7 个纳粹组织被起诉。十九名被告被定罪，被判处十五年 监禁至绞刑不等的刑罚。其中三个纳粹组织被裁定为犯罪组织。

There remained the huge task of repatriating all those displaced by the war. Millions of people had been shuttled around Europe by the Germans as they drew forced labor to Germany and dispatched Jewish people and others to concentration/death camps. The Soviets demanded the return of all their citizens. The Allies agreed to the controversial “Operation Keelhaul,” whereby people who had cooperated with the Germans against the Soviets, including Cossacks, Ukrainians, and Russians, were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union with the probability of a harsh and possibly fatal reception. Millions of others were also forcibly moved back to their “home” nations at the end of the war, such as Germans living in areas now belonging to Poland who were forced to leave for Germany. The hope was that this would help avoid ethnic tensions that might lead to another conflict. At the same time, 250,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust languished in camps for displaced persons because their home countries refused to take them back. About eighty thousand were eventually able to relocate to the United States, and more than 100,000 settled in the British Mandate of Palestine.

遣返所有因战争而流离失所的人的艰巨任务仍然存在。德国人将数百万人运送到欧洲各地，因为他们 向德国强迫劳动，并将犹太人和其他人送往集中营/死亡营。苏联要求所有公民返回。盟军同意了颇具 争议的“龙骨行动”，根据该行动，那些与德国人合作对抗苏联的人，包括哥萨克人、乌克兰人和俄罗斯 人，被强行遣返回苏联，很可能会受到严厉甚至可能致命的接待。战争结束后，还有数百万人被迫返 回自己的“祖国”，例如生活在现在属于波兰地区的德国人被迫前往德国。希望这将有助于避免可能导致 另一场冲突的种族紧张局势。与此同时，25万名大屠杀犹太幸存者在流离失所者营地中苦苦挣扎，因 为他们的祖国拒绝将他们接回。大约八万人最终搬迁到美国，超过十万人在英国托管的巴勒斯坦定 居。

On August 10, 1945, in the wake of the atomic attacks and the Soviet invasion of Manchukuo, Japanese Emperor Hirohito had informed his Privy Council that he accepted the Potsdam Declaration regarding Japan’s unconditional surrender, and soon thereafter the Allies were informed to that effect. Hirohito himself followed up on August 15 with the first public broadcast any emperor had ever made to the Japanese people, saying he would bear the pain of defeat and accept the Allied terms. A month later on September 2, General Yoshijirō Umezu, the army’s chief of staff, signed a surrender document aboard the USS Missouri at anchor in Tokyo Bay.

1945 年 8 月 10 日，在原子弹袭击和苏联入侵满洲国之后，日本裕仁天皇通知枢密院，他接受有关日 本无条件投降的波茨坦公告，不久之后盟军也获悉了这一消息。裕仁本人于 8 月 15 日向日本人民首次 发表天皇公开广播，表示他将忍受失败的痛苦并接受盟军的条件。一个月后的9月2日，陆军参谋长梅 津芳二郎将军在停泊于东京湾的密苏里号战列舰上签署了投降书

As supreme commander for the Allied powers, General Douglas MacArthur was ordered to exercise authority during the Allied occupation of Japan through the Japanese governmental system, including Emperor Hirohito. MacArthur charged the Japanese government to immediately repeal the Peace Preservation Law, which allowed for the arrest of anyone perceived to be posing a threat to— or critical of—the Japanese government, and to begin open and free discussion of the entire Imperial government and its institutions. Political prisoners were released, and the Special Police were disbanded.

作为盟军最高统帅，道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军在盟军占领日本期间受命通过包括裕仁天皇在内的日本政 府系统行使权力。麦克阿瑟要求日本政府立即废除《和平维护法》，该法允许逮捕任何被认为对日本 政府构成威胁或批评的人，并开始对整个帝国政府及其政权进行公开和自由的讨论。机构。政治犯被 释放，特警被解散。

In Tokyo, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East emerged from the Potsdam Declaration. (Since the Soviet Union had not declared war on Japan at that time, it was not a party to the agreement.) The trials began in 1946 and lasted until November 1948. Eighteen members of the Japanese military and nine senior politicians were indicted. All were found guilty but one, who was found mentally unfit to stand trial; six were executed and the rest sentenced to prison.

在东京，远东国际军事法庭根据《波茨坦宣言》诞生。 （由于当时苏联尚未对日宣战，因此不是该协 议的缔约方。）审判从1946年开始，一直持续到1948年11月。18名日本军方人员和9名高级政治家被 起诉。所有人都被判有罪，只有一人除外，他被认为精神上不适合接受审判；六人被处决，其余被判 入狱。

For six years, from 1946 to 1952, the United States dominated the occupation of Japan. General MacArthur and his occupation authorities partnered energetically in almost all aspects of Japanese politics, economics, and society to try to reform and rebuild Japan. The overall goals of the occupation were demilitarization, democratization, and the fostering of respect for fundamental human rights. The Constitution imposed by MacArthur and his Government Section in 1947 was the sort of fundamental change no single group in Japan itself could have effected. The fact that it has survived virtually unchanged suggests that the Japanese themselves came to terms with it and bent the system to reflect their habits of mind and politics. The emperor was made a figurehead, “the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.” Real sovereign power was vested in the people via the Diet, an elected two-chamber legislature. An extensive Bill of Rights guaranteed academic freedom, women’s suffrage, the right to choose residence, collective bargaining, and full employment.

从1946年到1952年的六年时间里，美国主导了对日本的占领。麦克阿瑟将军和他的占领当局在日本政 治、经济和社会的几乎所有方面都积极合作，试图改革和重建日本。占领的总体目标是非军事化、民 主化和促进对基本人权的尊重。麦克阿瑟和他的政府部门于 1947 年制定的宪法是日本任何一个团体都 无法实现的根本性变革。它几乎没有改变的事实表明，日本人自己已经接受了它，并改变了这一制度 以反映他们的思维和政治习惯。皇帝被任命为傀儡，“国家和人民团结的象征”。真正的主权权力是通过 议会（一个选举产生的两院立法机构）赋予人民的。内容广泛的《权利法案》保障了学术自由、妇女 选举权、选择居住地的权利、集体谈判权和充分就业。

Attempts took place across the globe to achieve some form of just and lasting peace. One glimmer of hope was the United Nations, an international body agreed to by the Allied leaders during wartime conferences and finally established in New York City in April 1945. The United Nations was pledged to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small . . . to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.”

全球各地都在努力实现某种形式的公正和持久和平。一线希望是联合国，这是一个由盟军领导人在战 时会议期间同意成立的国际机构，最终于 1945 年 4 月在纽约市成立。联合国承诺“使后代免遭战争的 祸害，两次在我们有生之年，给人类带来了难以言喻的悲伤，并重申对基本人权、男女和大小国家平 等权利的信念。 。 。在更大的自由中促进社会进步和更好的生活水平。”

As another aftermath of the war, women worldwide found themselves enjoying some of the freedoms and responsibilities of their fuller citizenship and participation in their nation’s fortunes. And populations in Africa and Asia, feeling they had earned liberation from prewar colonialism, began to reach for more self-determination and national legitimacy. It was widely felt that the struggles and sacrifices of so many could not and should not have been in vain.

作为战争的另一个后果，世界各地的妇女发现自己享受着更充分的公民身份和参与国家财富的一些自 由和责任。非洲和亚洲的人民感到自己已经从战前的殖民主义中解放出来，开始寻求更多的自决和国 家合法性。人们普遍认为，这么多人的斗争和牺牲不可能也不应该白费。
