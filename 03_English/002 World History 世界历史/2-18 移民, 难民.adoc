== 19-20世纪前几十年 的移民动向

Over the course of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century, approximately sixty million Europeans sought better economic opportunities on other continents. Most came from relatively nonindustrialized or agricultural regions, such as southern Italy and Sicily.

在十九世纪和二十世纪的前几十年里，大约6000万欧洲人到其他大陆(主要是美洲, 澳洲) 寻求更好的经济机会。大多数来自相对非工业化或农业地区，例如意大利南部, 和西西里岛。

Other common landing places for European immigrants were Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

欧洲移民其他常见的移民目的地, 还包括澳大利亚、新西兰, 南非。

==  去往美国

=== 19世纪上半叶

Approximately twenty-eight million Europeans and Canadians immigrated to the United States during this time, the majority between 1890 and 1914. Most were peasant farmers from southern and eastern Europe.

Many also continued to arrive from Germany and Ireland, the countries that had been responsible for the greatest influx of immigrants in the first half of the nineteenth century. Along with those fleeing poverty came victims of religious persecution, especially Jewish people of the Russian empire. Political dissidents and craftspeople displaced by industrialization made up the rest.

1890-1914年: 移民到美国的, 主要来自南欧和东欧. 大约有2800万人.

19世纪上半叶: 移民到美国的, 主要来自德国, 爱尔兰. 其他还有俄国的犹太人. 身份包括: 穷人, 持不同政见者, 受宗教迫害者.

Most people have heard of Ellis Island, the immigration station in the New York City harbor that welcomed millions of European immigrants to the United States. Less well known was Angel Island in San Francisco Bay that served as the station through which most Asian immigrants were processed while they awaited permission to enter the United States or were returned to their home countries. Today, it is a national historic landmark.

(19世纪, 来自亚洲的移民:) 大多数人都听说过"埃利斯岛"，这是纽约市港口的移民站，欢迎数百万"欧洲移民"来到美国。不太为人所知的是"旧金山湾的天使岛"，它是大多数"亚洲移民"在等待进入美国或返回祖国时, 经过的中转站。如今，它已成为国家历史地标。

===  排华法案 (1882)

Asian immigrants found themselves more unwelcome than European immigrants were. In 1882, the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prevented all Chinese laborers from immigrating to the country.  +
The Johnson-Reed Act banned all immigration from Asia, with the exception of people coming from U.S. territories in the Pacific.

亚洲移民发现自己比欧洲移民更不受欢迎。 1882年，美国通过了《排华法案》 ，禁止所有华工移民到美国。  +
(之后的1924年)"约翰逊-里德法案"禁止所有来自亚洲的移民，但来自太平洋美国领土的人除外。

=== 执行移民法, 限制人数 ( 约翰逊-里德法令, 1924)

By the end of the nineteenth century, many native-born Protestants of northern European ancestry in the United States began to call for changes in immigration laws.

These calls were met in 1924 with the passage of the Johnson-Reed Act, which set a quota on the total number of immigrants allowed to enter the United States from outside the Western Hemisphere. In addition, the act limited the number of immigrants of each nationality to 2 percent of the number already living in the United States in 1890. Thus, a person might be turned away if the permitted number of immigrants of that particular nationality had already been admitted, even if the total limit had not been reached.

Before 1890, most immigrants had come from northern and western Europe and relatively few from southern or eastern Europe. Thus, the 2 percent quota allowed far more English, Irish, and German people to enter than Italian, Polish, or Russian Jewish people.

Immigration from Asia, with the exception of the U.S. territory of the Philippines, was banned.

19世纪末, 在美国出生的新教徒, 开始呼吁修改移民法。1924年，《约翰逊-里德法案》（Johnson-Reed Act）通过, 规定:

只允许来自西半球的移民, 而亚洲移民(除美国殖民地菲律宾外)则被禁止.

西半球, 每个国籍的移民人数, 限制在1890年已经居住在美国的人数的2%以内。但是, 1890年以前，大多数移民来自北欧和西欧，南欧和东欧的移民相对较少。因此，2%的配额就意味着, 允许更多的英国、爱尔兰和德国人进入，而不是意大利、波兰或俄罗斯的犹太人。

既然对每个国家有单独的比例配额, 因此, 即使美国当年的总的移民人数限制尚未达到，只要某个特定国籍的移民配额已经用完，该国籍的人仍然可能会被拒之门外。

Canada was the destination of approximately 5.1 million people between the 1850s and the 1920s.

1850 年代-1920 年代, 510万人去往加拿大.

===  对中国移民征税, 以限制中国移民人数 (1885)

Although Canada did not ban Asian immigration, in 1885 it placed a tax of $50 on all Chinese people entering the country to work. Students, scientists, merchants, and government officials were exempt, but in subsequent years, the tax was raised.

尽管加拿大没有禁止亚洲移民，但在 1885 年，它对所有进入该国工作的中国人征收 50 美元的税。学生、科学家、商人和政府官员可以免税，但在随后的几年里，税收提高了。

=== 移民限制法令 (1901)

The White Australia Policy culminated in the passage of the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, excluding anyone who could not pass a dictation test administered in a European language.

1901 年《移民限制法令》通过，欧洲语言听写测试不过关的移民, 被拒绝.

'''

==  去往拉美

After the United States, it was Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay that received the largest numbers. Some 4.5 million emigrants went to Argentina, where at one point they made up 30 percent of the population. Latin America attracted many Italians and Germans as well as Spanish and Portuguese settlers.

移民目的地, 除美国外, 还有拉美的阿根廷、巴西、智利, 和乌拉圭。去往拉美的, 主要是意大利人, 德国人, 葡萄牙人.

In Latin America, the situation was much different. Argentina and Uruguay, for instance, had never had large populations because they lacked their neighbors’ mineral wealth and climates conducive to the growing of sugar and coffee. The arrival of European immigrants there was thus a welcome boost. Brazil and Venezuela deliberately sought out European immigrants to make their predominantly African, Native American, and biracial population more White.

(当美国之后, 通过法令限制移民人数时, ) 拉美则大不相同. 比如阿根廷和乌拉圭, 缺乏人口, 因为它们缺乏矿产和合适的气候, 来种植糖和咖啡, 因此就对欧洲移民缺乏力.

因此，它们欢迎欧洲移民的到来。巴西和委内瑞拉刻意寻求欧洲移民，以使其主要的非洲人、美洲原住民和混血儿人口, 更加白人化。

==  二战结束时的移民情况

There remained the huge task of repatriating all those displaced by the war. Millions of people had been shuttled around Europe by the Germans as they drew forced labor to Germany and dispatched Jewish people and others to concentration/death camps.

The Soviets demanded the return of all their citizens. The Allies agreed to the controversial “Operation Keelhaul,” whereby people who had cooperated with the Germans against the Soviets, including Cossacks, Ukrainians, and Russians, were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union with the probability of a harsh and possibly fatal reception.

Millions of others were also forcibly moved back to their “home” nations at the end of the war, such as Germans living in areas now belonging to Poland who were forced to leave for Germany. The hope was that this would help avoid ethnic tensions that might lead to another conflict.

At the same time, 250,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust languished in camps for displaced persons because their home countries refused to take them back. About eighty thousand were eventually able to relocate to the United States, and more than 100,000 settled in the British Mandate of Palestine.

遣返所有"因战争而流离失所的人"的艰巨任务, 仍然存在。数百万民众被德国人驱赶到欧洲各地，有的被强制带到德国从事劳动，有的犹太人及其他群体被送往集中营或死亡营。

苏联要求所有公民返回。盟军同意了颇具争议的“龙骨行动”（Operation Keelhaul），根据该行动，那些与德国人合作对抗苏联的人，包括哥萨克人、乌克兰人和俄罗斯人，都被强行遣返回苏联，即使他们很可能会受到严厉甚至致命的对待。

战争结束后，还有数百万人被迫返回自己的“祖国”，例如生活在现在属于波兰地区的德国人, 被迫前往德国。希望这将有助于避免可能导致另一场冲突的种族紧张局势。

与此同时，25万名大屠杀犹太幸存者, 在流离失所者营地中苦苦挣扎，因为他们的祖国拒绝接纳他们。大约8万人最终移居到美国，超过10万人定居在英国托管的巴勒斯坦。

'''

== 冷战后移民美国的情况

Millions of immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America have made their way into the United States over the last few decades. They serve an important role in the U.S. economy, often doing work domestic workers are unwilling to do. Many entered the country illegally and live and work in the shadows to avoid deportation. This makes them vulnerable to abuse.

过去几十年来，数百万来自墨西哥, 和拉丁美洲其他地区的移民, 进入美国。她们在美国经济中发挥着重要作用，往往从事家庭工人不愿意做的工作。许多人 非法进入该国, 并在阴影中生活和工作, 以避免被驱逐出境。这使他们很容易受到虐待.

==  难民逃亡西方发达国家, 引发问题

Instability in Iraq and Syria led to a flood of refugees making their way across the Mediterranean to Europe in 2015.

Many others sought to escape failing states and poverty in numerous parts of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. These refugees and economic migrants felt they would find a better and safer life in the developed countries of the West, particularly Germany, Sweden, Britain, France, and the United States.

2015年，伊拉克和叙利亚的不稳定局势, 导致大量难民穿越地中海, 前往欧洲.

而其他许多人, 则试图逃离中东、非洲和亚洲许多地区的失败国家和贫困。这些难民和经济移民认为, 他们会在西方发达国家，特别是德国、瑞典、英国、法国和美国，找到更好、更安全的生活。

Upon arrival, these groups met various responses. Others said they were fleeing circumstances outside the host country’s responsibility and would bring too many cultural and religious changes. For example, many Europeans feared that refugees from Islamic countries would reject the values of the largely secular European nations in which they settled. Many others believe that Muslims embrace political extremism or support acts of terrorism.

这些难民团体抵达后, 遇到了不同的反应。一些人则表示，他们逃离的那些母国(亚非拉的失败国家)的恶劣环境, 并非是东道国(即西方发达国家)本来应尽的责任，并将带来太多文化和宗教变化。例如，许多欧洲人担心, 来自伊斯兰国家的难民, 会拒绝他们所定居的大部分世俗欧洲国家的价值观。许多其他人认为, 穆斯林会拥护政治极端主义, 或支持恐怖主义行为。

chatgpt:   “they were fleeing circumstances outside the host country’s responsibility”  这句话的意思是: 有人认为这些难民逃离的原因, 并非东道国的义务或责任范围内的事情。换句话说，东道国不需要对他们逃离的动荡、冲突或贫困等原因负责。这种观点暗示，这些难民的困境并不是东道国造成的，因此东道国没有义务接纳他们或为他们提供庇护。

Responding to the developing migrant crisis, German chancellor Angela Merkel declared, “We can do this!” and promised Germany would welcome 800,000 refugees in 2015.

Others throughout Europe felt it was short-sighted. They noted that since Germany was in the European Union, bringing refugees there effectively amounted to bringing them into any other country in the EU.

针对日益严重的移民危机，德国总理安格拉·默克尔 宣称：“我们能做到！”并承诺德国将在2015年接纳80万难民。但整个欧洲的其他人却认为, 这是短视的。他们指出，由于德国是欧盟成员国，将难民带到那里, 实际上就相当于将他们带入了欧盟的任何国家中。
