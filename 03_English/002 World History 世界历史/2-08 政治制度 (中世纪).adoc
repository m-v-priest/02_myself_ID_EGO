=== feudalism 封建制度

In the ashes of the Carolingian world, medieval Europe embraced a social system called feudalism.

在(法兰克)加洛林王朝的废墟中，中世纪的欧洲拥抱了一种被称为"封建主义"的社会制度 (国王 → 诸侯领主→ 骑士).

|-> 国王

|However, the need to placate their feudal lords ensured that kings gave away lands and privileges, often weakening them. In other cases, crushing rebellious vassals was a way of taking back needed land.

(对国王来说, )然而，为了安抚封建领主，国王不得不放弃土地和特权，这往往会削弱他们的权力. 在其他情况下，镇压叛乱的封臣, 是夺回所需土地的一种方式。(削藩)

|-> 封臣

|This service was chiefly military in nature, but it could also include other obligations like advising the lord and attending his court when called.

(土地所有者, 赐予封臣土地.  相应的, 作为回报, 封臣为土地所有者供服务, ) 这种服务本质上主要是军事性的，但也可能包括其他义务，例如向土地所有者(比如领主)提供建议, 以及在接到命令时出席他的宫廷。

|-> 农奴

|Some laborers might own their own land and be self-directed, but most in western Europe were unfree, servile laborers called serfs who were tied to the land.

Serfs owed their lord `双宾` a set number of days of service a year (these were many) and could not leave the land, marry, or undertake other work without the lord’s permission.

They were not enslaved and could not be bought or sold, but they occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder.

一些劳动者可能拥有自己的土地并且可以自主，但在西欧，大多数劳动者都是不自由的奴役劳动者，被称为农奴，他们被束缚在土地上。 +
农奴每年要为领主服务一定天数（这些天数很多），未经领主许可不得离开土地、结婚或从事其他工作。 +
他们不是奴隶，不能被买卖，但处于社会阶层的最底层.
|===

While feudalism was not a political system, warriors owed service to lords who owed service to the king, who in theory was the largest landowner in the kingdom and the guarantor of rights and privileges.

Politically, thirteenth-century Europe was a series of confederations of warriors who had sworn oaths of vassalage, or loyalty, to one of the titular European kings. There were no real centralized governments, courts, or bureaucracies. The real power of kings rested on the willingness of their vassals to provide them with the support they had pledged.

虽然"封建制度"不是一种政治制度，但战士们要为领主服务，而领主又要为国王服务，理论上，国王是王国里最大的地主，也是权利和特权的保障者。

从政治上讲，十三世纪的欧洲是由一系列战士组成的联盟，他们宣誓效忠欧洲一位名义上的国王。而不存在真正的中央集权政府、法院,或官僚机构。国王的真正权力,取决于封臣是否愿意向他们提供他们所承诺的支持.

=== 封建制度的被取代 → 君权扩大, 封臣衰落

君权能扩大的原因:

|-> (意大利) 梅尔菲宪章 (1231年)

|The monarchy established secular political control through the 1231 Constitutions of Melfi, considered the oldest surviving written constitution in the world. The Constitutions of Melfi increased the power of the monarch by replacing vassals and church officials with royal bureaucrats as local administrators and judges.  The state created by the Constitutions of Melfi resisted church encroachment on its authority better than the Holy Roman Empire had.

The bureaucracy was funded by revenue from royal monopolies on essential products like salt, iron, and copper, along with tariffs and tolls.

君主政体通过 1231年的"梅尔菲宪法"（被认为是世界上现存最古老的成文宪法, 建立了世俗政权的统治。梅尔菲宪法通过用皇家官僚取代封臣和教会官员, 来担任地方行政长官和法官，增强了君主的权力。梅尔菲宪法创建的国家, 比神圣罗马帝国更好地抵制了教会对其权威的侵犯。

官僚机构的资金, 来自皇家对盐、铁和铜等基本产品的垄断收入，以及关税和通行费。

|-> (法国) 君主直接任命中央官员, 来管理地方 , 而不是将土地交给封臣(诸侯)来管理.

|A stronger central government also emerged in France over the thirteenth century. French monarchs exploited opportunities to add to their royal holdings by taking land from their nobles. These new lands were managed by salaried royal appointees, not vassals who could pass their holdings to heirs.

By the early fourteenth century, much of France was under direct royal control, greatly enhancing the resources French kings could call upon in conflicts with their vassals and the church.

十三世纪法国, 也出现了更强大的中央政府。法国君主利用机会从贵族手中夺取土地(削藩), 来增加王室财产。这些土地交给"领皇家薪水的官员"管理，而不是交给封臣(可继承给子孙)来管理。(就像秦始皇用郡县制代替分封制一样)

到了十四世纪初，法国的大部分地区都处于王室的直接控制之下，这极大地增强了法国国王在其与封臣和教会发生冲突时可动用的资源。

.火药的应用

[.small]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 火药的应用(枪支), 降低了使用武器的难度, 骑士就没落了.

|In most societies, male members of the nobility, often the only ones who could afford to purchase and pay for the upkeep of horses, had formed the core of the fighting forces. Their role as society’s defenders helped to justify the exalted position their class occupied. When handheld guns became common, armed peasant infantrymen supplanted the mounted elite. The loss of their warrior role often marked the beginning of the decline in the power of the aristocracy.

在大多数社会中，男性贵族成员通常是唯一有能力购买和支付马匹保养费用的人，他们构成了战斗 量的核心。他们作为社会捍卫者的角色, 有助于证明他们在社会等级中占据高位的合理性。但当火药手枪变得普遍时，农民步兵能取代骑兵精英(日本织田信长的足轻火绳枪, 打败了武田信玄的骑兵. AI绘画, 让画师的技能不值钱)。后者作为战士角色的丧失, 常常标志着贵族权力衰落的开始.

|-> 更高科技武器技术的发展,  将”军费”提高, 让君主与封臣在这场军费竞争中, 君主更有财力胜出, 导致君权扩大.

|Nobles found it difficult to challenge the power of rulers whose cannon could destroy their castles. Gunpowder thus helped to develop centralized states in Europe.

贵族发现很难挑战统治者的权力，因为统治者的大炮可以摧毁他们的城堡。(君主能在军力上, 压制住了封臣贵族的军力). 因此，火药有助于欧洲中央集权国家的发展. (如同现在, 军事科技的发展, 飞机导弹, 只会有利于统治者, 而人民越来越没有能力武器, 来与统治者抗衡了.)

|-> 火药的发展过程
|
- The first recorded use of gunpowder in battle occurred in China in 919. +

历史上第一次在战争中使用火药发生在 919 年的中国 (处于五代十国时期. 唐朝于907年灭亡. 北宋是960年才建立).

- Western Europeans discovered recipes for gunpowder in Arabic texts brought back from the Crusades +

西欧人在十字军东征带回的阿拉伯文献(情报档案)中, 发现了火药的配方

=== 封建制度的被取代 → 君权受到制约, 民权扩大

==== 英国

England developed differently than other European states. The monarch’s power over its vassals and the church was limited from the thirteenth century onward, and the basic rights of commoners were protected.

英国的发展与其他欧洲国家不同。从十三世纪开始，君主对其封臣和教会的权力受到限制，平民的基本权利受到保护。

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 规定: 君权不能削弱教会权利

|King John’s vassals compelled him in 1215 to reaffirm those rights and expand them in Magna Carta, a document that reiterated existing rights and relationships of vassals. The document confirmed the papal position that the church was above the state and “shall have its rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired... by our heirs in perpetuity.”

约翰的封臣迫使他在1215年重申了这些权利，并在《大宪章》中扩大了这些权利，这份文件重申了封臣的现有权利和关系。该文件确认了教皇的立场，即教会高于国家，“其权利不应减少，其自由不应受到损害……并由我们的后代永远继承。”

|-> 建立”含有平民代表”的议会

|The other key development leading toward centralized government with limited and specified powers was the creation of a deliberative body of nobles, clergy, and commoners that replaced the Great Council of the king’s vassals and high clergy. This new body evolved into Parliament, designed to represent the interests of the people. Membership was expanded to representatives elected by the vassals of the king’s vassals, and starting in 1265, selected towns could send representatives to speak for the interests of merchants.

通往有限和明确权力的中央政府的另一个关键发展, 是创建了一个由贵族、神职人员和平民组成的议事机构，取代了国王的附庸(封臣)和高级神职人员的“大议会”。这个新机构逐渐演变为议会，旨在代表人民的利益。议会的成员, 扩大到由国王附庸的附庸选出的代表，且从1265年起，指定的城镇可以派代表, 为商人的利益发声。

|-> 该议会的权力: 批准法律

|Parliament had two primary powers. One was to approve all tax increases.

To establish uniform rule by the monarch, as opposed to a decentralized set of laws from the nobility and a potentially conflicting set from the church, Edward I asked Parliament to also approve laws.

Parliamentary approval made the laws England’s laws, not just the king’s laws. Even if the king had drafted them, the nobles, clergy, and wealthy commoners had to agree to them.

议会有两项主要权力。其中一项是对"增税"与否有批准权。

为了建立君主的统一统治，而不是贵族制定分散的法律, 和教会制定可能相互冲突的法律，爱德华一世要求,议会也批准法律。

议会的批准, 就使这些法律成为英格兰的法律，而不仅仅是国王的法律。即使是国王起草的，也必须经得贵族、神职人员和富人平民的同意。

|-> 建立陪审团

|Among the rights spelled out in Magna Carta, perhaps the most important was that “no free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals.” This requirement created a precedent for trial by jury, which remains a staple of the judicial system in the West to the present day.

在 《大宪章》规定的权利中，也许最重要的是“任何自由人不得被扣押或监禁，或被剥夺其权利或财产， 或被取缔或流放，或以任何方式被剥夺其地位，我们也不得对他使用武力，或派遣其他人这样做，除非得到与他同等的人的合法判断。”这一要求开创了陪审团审判的先例，至今仍是西方司法制度的主要内容。

== (西欧) 君主集权

==== 绝对君主制 (16, 17世纪出现)

Absolute monarchies appeared in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as feudalism declined and new countries arose from medieval kingdoms.

十六、十七世纪，随着封建主义的衰落, 和中世纪王国中新国家的崛起，欧洲出现了"绝对君主制"。

These new nation-states were characterized by

这些新的民族国家的特点是:

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 君主不服从教皇, 也不与贵族阶层分享权力

|At the head of the state stood a monarch (usually a king) who claimed a divine right to rule. The medieval concept of monarchy had regarded kings as subservient to the pope, but absolute monarchs considered themselves subordinate to no one. They could rule as they wished with no need to confer with or seek the consent of others, or to share power with the noble class as medieval monarchs had done.

国家元首是一位君主（通常是国王），他声称拥有神圣的统治权。中世纪的君主制概念认为, 国王会服从教皇，但"绝对君主"认为, 自己不服从任何人。他们可以按照自己的意愿进行统治，无需与他人协商, 或寻求他人的同意，也无需像中世纪君主那样与贵族阶级分享权力。

|-> 君主自己一人做出任何政策.

|Absolute monarchs proclaimed their own laws, formulated foreign policy, administered justice (or appointed those who did so), and imposed taxes as they wished. They were the sole source of authority in their lands and often took steps to weaken the power of their nobles so they did not pose a threat to their rule.

绝对君主宣布自己的法律，制定外交政策，执行司法（或任命司法人员），并按照自己的意愿征收税收。他们是自己土地上的唯一权威来源，经常采取措施削弱贵族的权力，以免贵族对其统治构成威胁。(就如同中国皇帝一样)

|-> 中央进行集权管理

|centralized administrations and codified laws.

中央进行"集权"的行政管理, 和有"成文的法律"。

|-> 君主自己养军队, 不再靠封臣来提供

|They were guarded by professional standing armies, not noble vassals at the head of their own private armies.

他们由专业的常备军守卫，而不是由"贵族封臣"率领自己的私人军队。

=== 法国的君主集权

The most powerful of the absolute monarchies was France, and Louis XIV, who became king of France in 1643, was the epitome of a divine-right monarch.

君主专制国家中最强大的是法国，1643年成为法国国王的路易十四, 就是"君权神授"的典型。 +
divine-right : 神授权力, 指国王或女王代表上帝，并且拥有上帝赋予的权力。

|-> 剥夺贵族权力

|Unwilling to share power with the higherranked members of the French nobility, who had been responsible for numerous revolts against the French monarchy in the decades before he came to the throne, Louis deprived them of any role in governing or administering the state.

路易不愿与法国贵族中的高级成员, 分享权力，在他登基之前的几十年里，这些贵族曾多次发动反对法国君主制的叛乱，路易剥夺了他们在治理或管理国家方面的任何作用。

|-> 削弱贵族的财富

|He required that they live with him at his magnificent palace in Versailles, where they were invited to spend their time and money (which might otherwise have been used to plot revolts) in putting on displays of ostentatious living and competing with one another for the king’s favor.

他(路易)要求他们(贵族)和他一起住在他位于凡尔赛的宏伟宫殿里，在那里他们被邀请花时间和金钱（否则这些钱可能会被用来策划叛乱）展示奢华的生活，并相互竞争以获得国王的恩惠。

|-> 君主自己来颁布法律

|All state matters were rigorously scrutinized by Louis, and he promulgated legal codes for France’s colonies. “L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state”), he once famously proclaimed.

所有国家事务都受到路易的严格审查，并且他为法国殖民地颁布法律法规。他曾经说过一句著名的话：“ L’état, c’est moi ”（“朕即国家”）。
