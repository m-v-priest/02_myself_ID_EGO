== 亨利·哈德逊对北美的探索 (1609) → 发现了纽约港, 和哈德逊河

In 1609, Dutch merchants hired Henry Hudson, an English sea captain, to lead an expedition into the Atlantic Ocean. The Dutch hoped Hudson would find the long-sought Northwest Passage, a mythical water route thought to allow ships from Europe to sail west through the North American continent, cross the Pacific Ocean, and arrive in Asia.

Hudson discovered a deep-water port, now known as New York harbor, and a large river, now known as the Hudson, that led inland. For a moment it appeared he had found the Northwest Passage. However, the Hudson River became too shallow for ocean-going ships near present-day Albany, New York, and the expedition turned back.  Hudson did not find the Northwest Passage, but he did find a valuable port and rich river valley that he claimed for the Dutch.

1609年，荷兰商人聘请英国船长亨利·哈德逊率领一支探险队进入大西洋。荷兰人希望哈德逊能够找到一直在寻找的西北航道，这是一条神话般的水路，被认为可以让欧洲的船只向西航行，穿过北美大陆，穿越太平洋，到达亚洲。

哈德逊发现了一个深水港，现在称为"纽约港"，以及一条通往内陆的大河，现在称为"哈德逊河"。有一瞬间，他似乎找到了西北航道。然而，在今天的纽约州奥尔巴尼附近，哈德逊河变得太浅了, 无法让远洋船只继续航行，探险队只得折返。 +

哈德逊没有找到西北航道，但他确实找到了 一个有价值的港口和富饶的河谷，他声称这些是荷兰人的权利。

Besides disease, difficult terrain and dense brush also made European exploratory and military missions difficult. Following rivers inland was the easiest means of travel. However, most rivers were too shallow for sailing ships.

除了疾病之外，崎岖的地形和茂密的灌木丛, 也给欧洲的探索和军事任务带来了困难。沿着内陆河流行驶是最简单的旅行方式。然而，大多数河流水位太浅, 船只无法航行.

== ”新荷兰”(纽约一带) (1624)

After Hudson returned to Europe, the Dutch West India Company, a joint stock company much like the Virginia Company, made plans to set up a small colony in North America. In contrast to the settled agricultural model preferred by English colonists, the Dutch focused on trade. Company directors hoped their colony would improve their access to the North American fur trade, ensure their control of the valuable port eventually known as New York Harbor, and solidify their claim on the area, which they suspected might contain additional sources of wealth they had not yet discovered.

In 1624, thirty families aboard the ship Nieu Nederlandt arrived in what is now New York and founded the Dutch colony of New Netherlands. They came for many reasons, but many hoped to become rich by working in the fur trade.

哈德逊回到欧洲后，荷兰西印度公司，一个类似于弗吉尼亚公司的股份公司，计划在北美建立一个小殖民地。与英国殖民者偏好的定居农业模式相比，荷兰人更注重贸易。公司董事们希望他们的殖民地能够提高他们在北美从事皮毛贸易的能力，确保他们对最终被称为"纽约港"的有价值港口的控制，并巩固他们对该地区的主权主张，他们怀疑那里可能含有他们尚未发现的额外财富来源。

1624年，30个家庭乘坐Nieu Nederlandt船只到达现在的纽约，并建立了荷兰殖民地"新荷兰"。他们来这里有很多原因，但许多人希望通过从事毛皮贸易致富。

They also encouraged immigration from across Europe with promises of economic opportunities and some level of religious toleration that extended even to Jewish people, who faced severe discrimination in most of Europe.

New Netherlands soon became a prosperous colony populated by people from across Europe and Africa. Colonists lived in a band of farms and towns stretching along the Hudson River Valley from New Amsterdam, which is now New York City, north to the village of Beverwijck, now Albany. They engaged in some farming, but they mostly relied on the fur trade for their income.

他们还鼓励来自欧洲各地的移民，承诺提供经济机会和一定程度的宗教宽容，甚至包括犹太人，他们在欧洲大部分地区面临严重歧视。

"新荷兰"很快成为一个繁荣的殖民地，居住着来自欧洲和非洲各地的人们。殖民者居住在哈德逊河谷沿岸的一系列农场和城镇中，从新阿姆斯特丹（现在的纽约市）一直延伸到贝弗韦克村（现在的奥尔巴尼）。他们从事一些农业，但主要依靠毛皮贸易获得收入。

==  新阿姆斯特丹 (今曼哈顿岛的南端, 纽约) (1624)

New Amsterdam was founded by the Dutch in 1624, at the southern tip of the island now known as Manhattan. The city quickly became a thriving center of trade and commerce.  In 1664, an English military expedition captured the city and renamed it New York.

"新阿姆斯特丹"由荷兰人于 1624 年在今天的曼哈顿岛的南端建立。该城市迅速成为繁荣的贸易 和商业中心。1664年，一支英国远征军占领了这座城市，并将其更名为纽约.
