== 元朝, 滥发纸币, 导致通货膨胀

Yuan China’s economic growth had at best stagnated, thanks to a decline in consumer purchasing power caused by inflation and heavy taxation.

The use of paper currency was a major contributor to inflation. While paper money was theoretically convertible to metal or silk, the Yuan government issued much more of it than it had metal or silk to redeem it with. Kublai decreed that currency must be used in transactions with the government. This meant the population could not escape increasing inflation, however, as successive Yuan governments issued more paper currency to pay their bills and forced the population to obtain such money to pay their taxes.

元朝政府发行的纸币(交子等), 远多于可兑换的金属或丝绸。而且忽必烈颁布法令，必须用纸币与政府的交易，这意味着人民无法逃避日益严重的通货膨胀.

==  禁止对外贸易, 闭关锁国 (明, 朱元璋时)

Japan was not the only nation that turned inward in the seventeenth century. China did so as well.

To prevent the dangerous effect of outside ideas and potential challenges to his rule, Hongwu decided that Chinese contact with foreign lands would consist primarily of visits by vassals from tributary states.

In 1371, all private foreign trade was forbidden. Several years later, all foreign trade officially came to an end when the Maritime Trade Intendancies’ offices in the port cities of Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Quanzhou, through which all tribute goods were to flow, were closed. Harbors were filled with rocks and wooden stakes to prevent ships from using them. Ships were destroyed or left to rot in their docks.

A shore patrol was instituted to catch anyone attempting to engage in trade. Though the punishment was death, smugglers widely violated the rule.

和日本一样, 再17世纪, 中国也转向内向了, 在明朝洪武皇帝(朱元璋) 时.  +
1371年， 所有私人对外贸易被禁止.  +
几年后, 港口城市的海事局办事处被关闭，所有对外贸易正式结束.

建立海岸巡逻队, 以抓捕走私者, 但却禁止不了走私.

By cutting off access to foreign trade outside the tribute system, the Ming government greatly reduced its tax revenue, which left it constantly short of funds. Hongwu’s reforms, which were intended to reduce the cost of government, were largely unsuccessful.

由于除朝贡之外的对外贸易全被禁止, 导致明政府税收大减. 明政府为降低政府支出的改革, 基本上不成功。

==  七下西洋 (明, 永乐, 宣德 1430)

Hongwu’s son, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, dispatched Zheng He, a trusted palace eunuch, on a series of six voyages throughout the Indian Ocean. The purpose of these voyages was to demonstrate the wealth and power of China by distributing gifts to foreign rulers, thus prompting them to pledge themselves as vassals and offer tribute to the Ming emperor.

In 1430, the Xuande Emperor, the Yongle emperor’s grandson, ordered Zheng He to undertake his seventh and final voyage. These forays were China’s last significant effort to make contact with overseas lands for many decades, however. Factions at court worried about the effect of outsiders and their ideas on the empire, as well as the cost of the trips. Following Zheng He’s death, his charts and records were destroyed, and the ships of the fleet were left to rot.

明第三位皇帝, 永乐, 在1405-1421年间, 让郑和六次穿越印度洋, 向外国展现明朝实力, 并要求它们来朝贡.

永乐帝的孙子, 宣德帝, 在1430年令郑和第七次, 也是最后一次下西洋. 但朝廷内担心外国对明朝的影响, 以及旅行的费用. 因此在郑和死后, 他的航海图和记录被毁，船队船只也被任其腐烂。

==  重新放开对外贸易 (1567)

In 1567, the Ming dynasty reversed the policy that had prohibited foreign trade, and soon European merchant ships began arriving again.

一直要到 1567年，明朝才扭转了禁止对外贸易的政策，很快欧洲商船又开始抵达。

China’s economy boomed, and many Chinese peasants began to focus on producing goods for the foreign market. In Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province, people mass-produced porcelain.

许多农民开始专门生产国外所需商品。如, 在江西景德镇，人们大量生产瓷器。

== 经济破产, 导致明朝被推翻 (1644)

The days of the Ming were numbered. The cost of supporting the imperial family had grown astronomically. With the imperial government lacking sufficient funds to pay the army, Chinese soldiers were laid off.

In 1627–1628, hungry, impoverished, and angry soldiers and peasants rose up in revolt in northern China. By 1632, violence had spread to other provinces. This made it even harder for government officials to collect taxes, which Beijing had raised in 1639, angering people even more. In April 1644, Li Zicheng’s peasant army seized Beijing.

明朝吃白食的朱氏子孙太多, 供养他们的成本已成天文数字. 明政府财政破产, 解雇了士兵. +
1627年至1628年，中国北方饥饿的农民和士兵起义, 到 1632 年，暴力事件已经蔓延到其他省份。这使政府更难征税.  而北京在1639年又提高了税收，更激怒了人们。1644年4月，李自成占领北京。

It was not until 1683 that all of China was brought under Manchu control.

直到1683年，全中国才被满族控制。

==  一战时, 中国派劳工, 帮助美英一方

In Asia, the coming of the war caused nations to take sides.

(一战时,) 在亚洲, 每个国家对欧战双方, 各自站队.

The Allies rejected offers of military troops from China at the beginning of the war. By 1916, however, the situation had changed, and Britain and France allowed Chinese laborers to come to Europe. China had been willing to send combat troops, hoping to gain leverage in treaty negotiations after the war and support for ousting Japan from its borders, but Japan, which had taken control of Qingdao and hoped to establish itself as the unquestioned military power in Asia, would not permit it. Thus, approximately 130,000 Chinese laborers arrived in Europe, to repair equipment and dig trenches but not to fight.

战争初期，同盟国拒绝了中国派遣军队的提议。但到了1916年，情况发生了变化，英国和法国允许中国劳工来到欧洲。中国一直愿意派军队加入英法俄一方作战, 希望在战后的条约谈判中, 获得筹码，并将日本赶出中国. 但日本阻碍中国实现这一点.  因此，中国只能以派出”劳工”的形式, 让13万人来到欧洲，修理设备和挖掘战壕，但不参加战斗。

==  收回西藏 (1951)

In 1951, representatives of the PRC and the Tibetan government signed the Seventeen Point Agreement making the region once again part of China, an event described by the CCP as the “liberation of Tibet.” In 1959, the Dalai Lama, the ruler of Tibet and leader of Tibetan Buddhism, fled to India with other members of the Tibetan government, who maintained that the agreement with China had been made under duress.

1951年，中华人民共和国和西藏政府代表, 签署了《十七条协议》 ，使该地区再次成为中国的一部分，这一事件被中共称为“西藏的解放”。 1959年，西藏统治者、藏传佛教领袖达赖喇嘛, 与西藏政府其他成员, 逃往印度，他们坚称, "与中国的协议"是在胁迫下达成的。

==  The Great Leap Forward 大跃进 (1957年底 - 1960年代初) → 集体化成公社, 从农村榨取资源, 来供应工业发展, 结果造成大饥荒

In imitation of the Soviet model, Mao instituted a Five-Year Plan in China in 1953 and embarked on nearly seven hundred industrial projects, more than one hundred with the assistance of the Soviet Union.

毛泽东效仿苏联模式，于1953年在中国制定了"五年计划"，并启动了近七百个工业项目，其中一百多个是在苏联的援助下进行的。

He also began the collectivization of agriculture by forcing peasants to labor together on state-owned farms instead of tending to farms worked by individual families.

Although the first Five-Year Plan was successful, the second Five-Year Plan proved a disaster. This plan, also known as the Great Leap Forward, began in 1958.

The proceeds of agriculture would fund industry.

他还开始实行"农业集体化"，强迫农民在国有农场一起劳动，而不是照料家庭个体经营的农场。

虽然第一个五年计划是成功的，但第二个五年计划却是一场灾难。这个计划，也被称为“大跃进” ，始于1958年。目的是农业收益将为工业提供资金。

Collectivization efforts were intensified, and by the end of 1958 more than twenty-five thousand communes had been created, each consisting of several thousand families on average.

Communes were large units of production. All tools, livestock, food, and other valuable items belonged to the commune as a whole instead of to individuals or families, and the commune’s leaders determined what work each member would do. Members worked together to grow crops in warm months and build construction projects during the winter.

Food was prepared in communal kitchens, and everyone ate together in communal dining halls. Communes also operated schools and hospitals for their members.

集体化力度不断加大，到1958年底，已创建了两万五千多个公社，平均每个公社有几千户人家。

"公社"是大型生产单位。所有工具、牲畜、 食物和其他有价值的物品都属于整个公社，而不是个人或家庭，公社的领导决定每个成员的工作。成员们共同努力，在温暖的月份种植庄稼，在冬季建设建筑项目。

食物是在公共厨房准备的，每个人都在公共食堂一起吃饭。公社还为其成员经营学校和医院。

Grain produced by communes in the countryside fed city dwellers and industrial workers. Communes began to exaggerate their grain production levels to win political favor. Even as they strove to grow more food, laborers were also ordered to engage in extra projects like dam construction.

The requisitioning of grain to feed the cities produced disaster in rural China. crops. Famine set in, and people ate bark, leaves, and clay. Some Chinese historians place the death toll at five million, while Western historians believe thirty to fifty million people died between 1959 and 1961.

农村公社生产的粮食, 将供应给城市居民和产业工人。公社开始夸大粮食生产水平, 以赢得政治支持。即使他们努力种植更多的粮食，也要被命令去从事水坝建设等额外项目。

征用粮食来养活城市，给中国农村带来了灾难。饥荒来临，人们吃树皮、树叶和粘土。一些中国历史学家认为，1959年至1961年 间，死亡人数为500万人，而西方历史学家则认为，有30至500万人死亡。

Farm laborers were also ordered to produce steel in backyard furnaces hastily built in the countryside. To meet quotas, they stripped the countryside of wood and burned their own furniture to fuel the furnaces. In the end, the steel produced was of such low quality that it was worthless.

农场工人还被命令, 在农村匆忙建造的后院熔炉中, 生产钢铁. 为了满足配额，他们砍伐了乡村的木材, 并烧毁了自己的家具, 来为熔炉提供燃料。最终，生产出来的钢材质量低劣，毫无价值。

Deng especially began to reverse some of Mao’s more damaging policies by, for example, allowing peasants to sell grain surpluses. Given positive incentives to produce more food, the peasants did so, alleviating food shortages.

Mao was sensitive to failure, however, and resented the successes of Zhou, Deng, and Liu. When Marshall Peng Dehuai, the Minister of Defense and a longtime associate of Mao, criticized his handling of the Great Leap Forward, Mao dismissed him from his position and replaced him with Lin Biao.

邓(小平)特别开始扭转毛泽东的一些更具破坏性的政策，例如允许农民出售剩余粮食。由于受到生产更多粮食的积极激励，农民们这样做了，从而缓解了粮食短缺。

然而，毛对失败很敏感，并对周、邓、刘的成功感到不满。当毛泽东的长期助手、国防部长彭德怀元帅批评他对"大跃进"的处理时，毛泽东解除了他的职务，并由林彪取代了他。

==  the Cultural Revolution 文化大革命 (1966.05 - 1976.10) → ① 利用红卫兵来铲除毛泽东思想的敌人. ② 然后, 红卫兵利用完了, 就被毛抛弃, 令他们下放到农村.

In 1966, Mao abruptly warned that “revisionists” were seeking to alter the direction of the CCP. He called on the younger generation of Chinese people—high school and university students and young factory workers—to engage in “class struggle” and save the revolution. In July 1966 he launched the event known as the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

1966年，毛突然警告说，“修正主义者”正在寻求改变中共的方向。他呼吁中国的年轻一代——高中 生、大学生, 和年轻的工厂工人——进行“阶级斗争”并拯救革命。 1966年7月，他发起了被称为“中国文化大革命”的事件。

Students organized themselves into groups of “Red Guards,” guided by quotations of Mao that Lin Biao had gathered and published in a “Little Red Book.”

In August 1966, millions of Red Guards rallied in Beijing as Mao and Lin Biao encouraged them to purge the country of “bourgeois” elements by attacking the “Four Olds”: old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas.

Red Guards then attacked and killed their teachers and school administrators. Provided with food and lodging at government expense, Red Guards rampaged through the country, destroying books, works of art, temples, monasteries, tombs, and historical sites. They beat people and forced them to confess to having bourgeois thoughts. No one knows how many were killed during the Cultural Revolution; it may have been as many as two million.

学生们按照林彪收集并发表在“红宝书”中的毛泽东语录为指导，自行组织成“红卫兵”小组。1966年8月，数百万红卫兵在北京集会，毛泽东和林彪鼓励他们通过破除“四旧”：旧风俗、旧文化、旧习惯、旧思想，清除国家中的“资产阶级”分子。

随后，红卫兵袭击并杀害了他们的老师和学校管理人员。在政府出资提供食物和住宿的情况下，红卫兵在全国各地横行，毁坏书籍、艺术品、寺庙、寺院、坟墓和历史遗迹。他们打人，强迫人承认有资产阶级思想。没有人知道文化大革命期间有多少人被杀；可能有多达两百万。

Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, who displayed insufficient revolutionary fervor, were removed from positions of power.

革命热情不够的刘少奇、邓小平被撤职。

In 1968, the Red Guards were themselves dismissed as Mao sought to curb their power. They were sent to the countryside along with other urban youth to learn from the peasants.

1968年，由于毛泽东试图遏制红卫兵的权力，红卫兵本身也被解职。他们和其他城市青年一起下放到农村，向农民学习。

In 1969, Lin Biao was named Mao’s successor. Two years later, Lin died in a plane crash while attempting to flee to the Soviet Union. He may have feared that Mao suspected him of plotting against him and planned to punish him.

1969年，林彪被任命为毛泽东的接班人。两年后，林在试图逃往苏联时因飞机失事身亡。他可能担心毛怀疑他密谋反对他，打算惩罚他。

== 四人帮掌权期

As Mao retreated into depression and ill health, his role was increasingly taken over by “The Gang of Four,” consisting of Mao’s wife Jiang Qing, his chosen successor Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan. However, they were primarily concerned with ensuring ideological purity and the continuation of “revolutionary” political thought. Crucial matters such as the economy were left in the hands of Premier Zhou Enlai.

Zhou, however, was dying of cancer and needed help. He returned Deng Xiaoping to power to assist him.

随着毛泽东陷入抑郁和健康状况不佳，他的角色越来越多地被“四人帮”所取代，其中包括毛泽东的妻子江青、他选定的继任者王洪文、张春桥和姚文元。然而，他们主要关心的是确保意识形态的纯洁性, 和“革命”政治思想的延续。经济等重要事务都交给了周恩来总理。然而，周恩来因癌症生命垂危，他让邓小平重新掌权以帮助他.

Following Zhou’s death in January 1976, the Gang of Four managed to oust Deng Xiaoping from power once more, but this time he did not remain away for long.

Following Mao’s death on September 9, 1976, his successor Hua Guofeng had the Gang of Four arrested and Deng returned to power.

1976年1月周去世后，“四人帮”再次将邓小平赶下台，但这一次他并没有离开太久。1976 年 9 月 9 日毛泽东去世后，他的继任者华国锋逮捕了“四人帮”，邓小平重新掌权。

'''

==  邓小平改革开放 (1978.12)

In 1978, he replaced Hua as leader of China and argued that the country needed to focus on modernizing and building its economy instead of continuing to pursue revolution by following the teachings of Mao. The Chinese system of higher education returned to normal as Deng reinstated entrance examinations, which had been suspended during the Cultural Revolution.

1978年，邓小平取代华国锋成为中国领导人，并认为国家需要专注于现代化和建设经济，而不是继续遵循毛泽东的教导进行革命。随着邓小平恢复文革期间暂停的入学考试，中国的高等教育体系恢复正常.

Beginning in the late 1980s, relations with the Soviet Union also began to improve.

从20世纪80年代末开始，与苏联的关系也开始改善.
