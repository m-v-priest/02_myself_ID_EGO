== 丰臣秀吉, 拒绝西方基督教对其统治的威胁 (1587 驱逐传教士)

Nagasaki, on the southern island of Kyushu, was the most Christianized community in Japan.

长崎位于九州岛南部，是日本基督教化程度最高的社区。

In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered Christian missionaries to leave Japan. Note the various reasons he gives for expelling the missionaries: When a vassal receives a province, a district, a village, or another form of a fief, he must consider it as a property entrusted to him on a temporary basis. However, some vassals illegally commend part of their fiefs to the church. This is a culpable offense.

1587年，丰臣秀吉命令基督教传教士离开日本。请注意他给出的驱逐传教士的各种理由: 当封臣获得省份、地区、村庄或其他形式的封地时，他必须将其视为临时委托给他的财产。然而，一 些封臣非法地将其部分封地赠予教会。

==  德川家康:  限制大名能叛乱的条件

To consolidate power, Tokugawa Ieyasu rewarded loyal daimyos with gifts of land. He allocated 15 percent of Japan’s richest rice-producing land to himself and his heirs.

The next-best land, about half of that available, was given to his “inside daimyos,” samurai who were related to him or who had declared their loyalty before the Battle of Sekigahara.

The remaining land, less fertile or farthest away from the new capital of Edo (modern-day Tokyo), was given to the “outside daimyos,” samurai clans that had proclaimed loyalty only after his victory or that had fought against him.

一等土地: 德川自己掌控 +
二等土地: 交给亲戚, 与亲信 +
三等土地; 交给最后才效忠它的人.

Ieyasu prohibited daimyos from forming alliances, including marriages, without his approval. He also required them to spend every other year in Edo, where it would be more difficult for them to formulate rebellion.

①未经德川批准, 大名不准结盟, 包括婚姻. ②大名必须每隔一年就到江户住一次, 降低他们策划叛乱的可能性.

'''

==  德川家康: 驱逐传教士 (1614)

In 1614, Ieyasu outlawed the practice of Christianity and ordered missionaries to leave the country. Japanese Christians were warned that if they did not renounce their faith, they would be killed. It was clear to Ieyasu that the best way to keep Christian influence out of the country was to ban the entry of foreigners and forbid Japanese to leave.

Preventing Japanese from leaving the country would also keep daimyos from conspiring against him in foreign lands.

1614年, 德川禁止基督教, 驱逐传教士. 令日本基督徒放弃信仰, 否则就处死.  +
另外阻止日本人离开日本, 这样就能防止大名在国外密谋反对他.

'''

==  兰学, 为日本打开了一扇持续了解西方发展的窗户

In 1624, the Spanish were banned from entering Japan. In 1639, Ieyasu prohibited the entry of the Portuguese.

The Dutch, who had refrained from missionary activity, were still allowed to enter Japan to trade. However, to limit any harmful influence on their part, Dutch merchants were confined to a settlement on Dejima Island in the harbor of Nagasaki, in a walled compound they were not allowed to leave. Only licensed trade officials and translators (a position that became hereditary) could have contact with them.

The English might have been extended the same rights, but finding trade with Japan not as profitable as they had hoped, they no longer sent ships.

1624年，西班牙人被禁止进入日本。 1639年，家康禁止葡萄牙人入境。

荷兰人虽然不再进行传教活动，但仍然被允许进入日本进行贸易。然而，为了限制对他们造成的有害影响，荷兰商人被限制在长崎港出岛的一个定居点内，在一个有围墙的院落里，他们不准离开。 只有获得许可的贸易官员和翻译 （这一职位后来成为世袭的）才能与他们接触。

英国人可能获得了同样的权利，但发现与日本的贸易, 并不像他们希望的那样有利可图，因此他们不再派遣船只来。

In 1635, Japanese were forbidden to leave the country except on special missions, like transacting trade with Korea, China, and Russia.

1635 年，日本人被禁止出境，除非执行特殊任务，例如与韩国、中国和俄罗斯进行贸易。

“Dutch learning,” knowledge gained from the Dutch on Dejima, played an important part in Japanese life in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

In the early eighteenth century, prohibitions on books were relaxed, and works on medicine, science, and geography were translated. Thus, “Dutch learning” provided a foundation for Japanese scientific and technological development and kept people informed of what was happening in Europe.

但“兰学(学习荷兰)”，即从出岛荷兰人获得的知识，在 17 世纪和 18 世纪的日本人生活中发挥了重要作用。十八世纪初，书籍禁令放松，医学、科学和地理方面的著作被翻译。因此，“兰学”为日本科技发展奠定了基础，让人们了解欧洲正在发生的事情.

==  美国到来 (1853)

In July 1853, U.S. commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Edo (Tokyo) Bay at the head of a fleet of four gunships, charged with negotiating diplomatic relations and trade agreements with Japan. Japan had largely closed itself off in the 1600s to avoid colonization and domination by western countries.

Talks between Perry and the Japanese government ensued, and on March 31, 1854, Japan signed the Convention of Kanagawa, which opened the ports of Shimoda and Hakotate to American ships, promised assistance for American ships and sailors shipwrecked on Japanese coasts, granted American merchants permission to purchase provisions in Japan, and promised peaceful and friendly relations between the United States and Japan.

1853年7月，美国海军准将马修·佩里（Matthew Perry）率领一支由四艘武装战舰组成的舰队, 驶入江户（东京）湾，负责与日本谈判外交关系和贸易协定。日本在17世纪基本上是封闭的，以避免西方国家的殖民和统治。

1854年3月31日，日本签署了《神奈川公约》，内容是: 1.向美国船只开放下田港和函馆港，2.承诺援助在日本海岸遇难的美国船只和水手，3.允许美国商人在日本购买粮食，4.承诺美日之间的和平友好关系。

Not only would industrialization elevate “inferior” craftspeople and merchants, who were far below them in the social hierarchy, but the shogunate’s end would deprive them of power and influence.

工业化不仅会提升“下等”工匠和商人的地位，而且终结幕府, 也会剥夺大名和武士们的权力和影响力。

'''

==  日本提出殖民地要求

Lacking many of the raw materials necessary for industrialization, Japan, like other industrialized nations, began to seek them abroad. It first took control of the Ryukyu Islands and also claimed the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin Island. Russia, however, also laid claim to these territories, and for a while the two nations shared Sakhalin Island. In 1875, Japan relinquished its claims to the island in exchange for complete control over the Kurile Islands.

由于缺乏工业化所需的许多原材料，日本像其他工业化国家一样，开始向国外寻求原材料。它首先控制了琉球群岛，并声称对"千岛群岛"和"库页岛"拥有主权。然而，俄罗斯也声称对这些领土拥有主权，两国一度共享库页岛。 1875年，日本放弃对该岛的主权要求，以换取对"千岛群岛"的完全控制。

Unlike many European nations, Japan sought colonies closer to home, including the Ryukyu, Kurile, and Sakhalin Islands.

日本帝国。与许多欧洲国家不同，日本寻求离本土更近的殖民地，包括琉球群岛、千岛群岛和萨哈林群岛。

== 半控制朝鲜 (1876, 江华条约)

Japan’s most desired prize was Korea. In 1873, Korea’s King Gojong began to consider opening the nation to the outside world. Anxious to gain an advantage, in 1876 Japan sent a gunboat to force Korea to sign the Japan-Korea Treaty of Amity (Ganghwa Treaty) before it could make commercial treaties with other nations.

Among other provisions, the treaty allowed the Japanese to establish trading ports in addition to the one to which they already had access. It also let Japanese merchants live and work in Korea while subject only to Japanese law. In addition, Korea was declared to no longer be a tributary state of China.

日本最想要的战利品是朝鲜。1873年，朝鲜高宗国王开始考虑对外开放。1876年，日本急于取得优势，派出一艘炮舰，迫使朝鲜在与其他国家签订商业条约之前签署《日韩友好条约》（江华条约）。在其他条款中，该条约允许日本人在他们已有的港口之外再建立贸易港口。它还允许日本商人在韩国生活和工作，但仅受日本法律的约束。此外，朝鲜被宣布不再是中国的附属国。

'''

== 控制台湾 (1895, 马关条约)

China did not wish to relinquish its control so easily, and a series of uprisings and mutinies in Korea in the 1880s gave it the opportunity to reassert its authority. In 1885, however, both Japan and China agreed to withdraw military forces from the peninsula in 1885. Although this temporarily prevented armed conflict between Japan and China, hostilities between the two soon commenced.

In 1894,  the Donghak Rebellion swept Korea as disgruntled peasants demanded social reforms, giving China an excuse to dispatch a military force to Korea in violation of its agreement with Japan. Japan in turn sent troops to confront the Chinese, and the First Sino-Japanese War began.

中国不想轻易放弃控制权，1880年代朝鲜发生的一系列起义和兵, 变给了它重新确立权威的机会。然而，日本和中国在1885年同意从半岛撤军。虽然这暂时阻止了日本和中国之间的军事冲突，但两国之间的敌对行动很快就开始了。

1894年，东学起义席卷韩国，不满的农民要求社会改革，这给中国提供了借口，违反与日本的协议, 向朝鲜派遣了军队。日本随后出兵与中国对抗，甲午战争爆发。

Humiliated, China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which recognized Korea’s independence and conceded to Japan territory on the Liaodong Peninsula in Manchuria as well as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Japan had now acquired an empire.

屈辱的中国于 1895年签署了《马关条约》 ，承认朝鲜独立，并将满洲辽东半岛、台湾和澎湖列岛的领土, 割让给日本。日本现在已经获得了一个帝国地位。

'''

== 吞并朝鲜 (1910, 日俄战争后, 朴茨茅斯条约 )

Japan quickly realized, however, that it would have to defend its gains from its old rival Russia. In 1896, Koreans, angered by the assassination of their pro-Chinese queen by Japanese agents, overthrew the pro-Japanese government then in power. As Japanese influence waned, Russian influence grew.

然而，日本很快意识到，它必须捍卫从老对手俄国那里获得的利益。 1896年，亲中国的朝鲜皇后被日本特工暗杀，激怒了朝鲜人，他们推翻了当时掌权的亲日政府。随着日本影响力的减弱，俄罗斯影响力的增强.

Russia also began to encroach upon Japanese territory in Manchuria. Russia’s one Pacific port, Vladivostok, was often frozen over. Seeking a harbor that was ice-free year-round, Russia leased land from China on the Liaodong Peninsula in 1897 and built a new port, Port Arthur. A wary Japan offered Russia free rein on the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for Japan’s retaining control over Korea. When Russia refused to compromise, Japan attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur in the winter of 1904, beginning the Russo-Japanese War.

Once again, Japan emerged victorious over a much larger nation. The Treaty of Portsmouth, signed in September 1905, acknowledged Japan’s right to Korea and awarded Japan control of southern Manchuria. Japan formally annexed Korea in 1910.

俄罗斯也开始侵占日本在满洲的领土。俄罗斯的太平洋港口之一"符拉迪沃斯托克"经常被冰冻。为了寻求一个常年不冻的港口，俄罗斯于1897年从中国租用了辽东半岛的土地，建造了一个新的港口——旅顺港。警惕的日本向俄罗斯提供了对辽东半岛的自由支配权，以换取日本保留对朝鲜的控制。当俄罗斯拒绝妥协时，日本于 1904 年冬天袭击了"旅顺港"的俄罗斯舰队，日俄战争爆发。

日本再次战胜了一个更大的国家。 1905 年 9 月签署的《朴茨茅斯条约》承认日本对朝鲜的权利，并授予日本对满洲南部的控制权。日本于1910年正式吞并朝鲜。

'''

==  (一战时) 日本站在英法俄一边. 袭击德国的殖民港口青岛.

The Japanese Empire, emboldened by its success against Russia less than a decade earlier in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), saw the opportunity to increase its standing in the world and sided with the Allies. Japanese forces attacked the German colonial port at Qingdao (Tsingtao), a city on the Chinese coast that Germany had held for less than twenty years as the planned headquarters of its Asian empire.

'''

==  一战后的凡尔赛条约, 允许日本将它占领的”德国在中国的势力范围山东省”, 保留到1922年为止

One provision of the treaty related directly to Japan and China. Japan had occupied China’s Shandong Province, a former German concession, including the port of Qingdao (Tsingtao), and continued to hold it after the war. Without consulting the millions of Chinese people living there at the time, the treaty makers allowed Japan to retain this territory, which it did until 1922.

凡尔赛条约中的一项条款, 与日本和中国直接相关。日本占领了中国山东省（前德国租界），包括青岛港，并在战后继续占据它。条约制定者在没有咨询当时居住在那里的数百万中国人民的情况下，就允许日本保留这片领土，直到 1922 年为止。

'''

==  大正民主时期 (1920年代)

In the Taisho period in the 1920s, the Japanese economy was buffeted by booms and recessions, the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, inflation, and a serious banking crisis in 1927. Japan had become heavily dependent on trade with the United States, and its urban economy was now undermined by the protectionism practiced by both U.S. and European markets in the form of tariffs on foreign imports. Japan’s economy continued growing in the 1920s, however, as the country increased military production and began making investments in China.

在 1920 年代的大正时期，日本经济经历了繁荣和衰退、1923 年关东大地震、通货膨胀以及 1927 年 严重的银行危机。日本已经严重依赖与美国的贸易，其城市经济, 也受到美国和欧洲对外国进口征收关税的保护主义的损害。然而，随着日本增加军事生产, 并开始在中国投资，日本经济在 20 年代继续增长.

Japan also took steps toward becoming more democratic for a brief period after World War I. In 1912, a new emperor, Taisho, had ushered in a period of liberalism with democratic and progressive politics. For example, labor strikes became increasingly common as workers fought for better wages and working conditions. Women became active in labor unions and politics for the first time, and the number of unions more than tripled in the 1910s. During this period, Japan was viewed as a triumph of constitutional government.

日本在第一次世界大战后的短暂时期内, 也采取了更民主的措施。1912年，新天皇"大正", 开创了一个政治民主进步的自由主义时期。例如，随着工人们争取更好的工资和工作条件，劳工罢工变得越来越普遍。妇女首次积极参与工会和政治，工会数量在 1910 年代增加了两倍多。这一时期的日本, 被视为宪政的胜利。

However, the progressive period did not last long. In 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, destroyed two major cities, Yokohama and Tokyo. Rumors quickly spread that Koreans in the area were taking advantage of the chaos, were plotting political insurrection, and had already poisoned wells to contaminate the drinking water. The devastation also provided an opportunity for the conservative and pro-military forces in the Japanese government to exercise increased control over society. Martial law was declared, and the repression of radicals was stepped up. Political activists who questioned government policies disappeared.

然而，进步时期并没有持续多久。 1923年，里氏7.8级关东大地震, 摧毁了横滨和东京两个主要城市。谣言很快传开，称该地区的朝鲜人正在趁乱, 策划政治叛乱，并已在水井中投毒, 污染饮用水。这次灾难为日本政府中的保守派和亲军方势力, 提供了加强社会控制的机会。宣布戒严，加强镇压激进分子。质疑政府政策的政治活动人士消失了。

'''

==  昭和时代, 日本开始在中国扩张殖民地

When the emperor died in 1926, his son Hirohito ascended to power, and the Shöwa period began.

1926 年天皇去世，其子"裕仁"继位，"昭和时代"开始。

Japan’s political system now became increasingly dominated by the military. The country’s military leaders believed more aggressive actions were needed for Japan to control the Pacific as they wanted to. Japan’s military establishment and certain factions of its army became increasingly contemptuous of civilian leaders. By the late 1920s, they saw these politicians as incapable of solving domestic issues or addressing challenges from China and the Soviet Union. Some disaffected Japanese field commanders in China and the Japanese colony of Korea began to engage in direct actions.

日本的政治体系, 现在越来越由军队主导. 该国军事领导人认为，日本需要采取更积极的行动, 才能按照他们的意愿控制太平洋。(战狼派，鹰派.) 日本的军事机构, 和军队中的某些派别, 越来越蔑视文职领导人。到了 1920 年代末，他们认为这些政客没有能力解决国内问题, 或应对来自中国和苏联的挑战。一些不满的日本驻中国和朝鲜的指挥官, 开始采取直接行动. (制造918事变)

'''

== 日本军中的激进派, 对文职官员威望的压制和刺杀

The Japanese secret societies within the military were animated by an exaggerated sense of Japan’s destiny. They began a campaign of violence against the Japanese civilian government. Elements of the Imperial Navy launched a coup in March 1932 by executing Japan’s former finance minister, Junnosuke Inoue, and Baron Dan, the head of Mitsui Corporation, as traitors to the Japanese people. On May 15, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was shot to death by eleven young naval officers.

Between 1930 and 1935, the Japanese witnessed twenty terrorist incidents, the assassination of four political leaders, the attempted murders of five others, and four coup attempts.

日本军队内的秘密社团, 因对日本命运的夸张认识, 而活跃起来。他们开始了针对日本文官政府的暴力运动。 1932年3月，帝国海军发动政变(血盟团事件)，将日本前财务大臣"井上准之助", 和三井物产公司总裁"团琢磨", 作为日本人民的叛徒处决。 5月15日，首相"犬养毅"
被11名年轻海军军官枪杀。

1930 年至 1935 年间，日本目睹了 20 起恐怖事件、四名政治领导人被暗杀、另外五人被谋杀未遂, 以及四次政变企图。

In the first half of the twentieth century, the dominant political party in Japan was a fusion of Meiji oligarchs, government bureaucrats, and recruits from other political parties. The Seiyukai, as it was named, consistently supported a march toward authoritarian government. Beginning in 1932, “national unity” governments dominated by high-ranking military officers increasingly assumed power and repressed threats and enemies. Authoritarian government took hold from the top down in the mid-1930s, as the military intimidated and overpowered civilian governance and created a military dictatorship.

二十世纪上半叶，日本的主导政党, 是明治寡头、政府官僚, 和其他政党新成员的融合体。正如其名称所示，"政友会"始终支持走向"独裁政府"。从 1932 年开始，由高级军官主导的“民族团结”政府, 越来越多地掌握权力, 并镇压威胁和敌人。 20 世纪 30 年代中期，独裁政府自上而下, 军队恐吓并压制了文官政府，建立了军事独裁政权。

==  塘沽停战协定 (1933) → 将伪满洲国与中国分离

On May 22, 1933, the Japanese and China’s Guomindang government (GMD, also spelled “Kuomintang”) concluded the Tanggu Truce, forming a demilitarized zone that stretched one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall and essentially detached Manchukuo from the nation of China.

1933 年 5 月 22 日，日本和中国国民党政府（GMD，也拼写“国民党”）缔结了 《塘沽停战协定》 ，形成了一个绵延长城以南 100 公里的非军事区，基本上将"满洲国"从这个国家中分离出来。

'''

== 西安事变 (1936.12) → 国共双方统一对日

The nationalist GMD government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had been fighting a civil war since 1927.

In December 1936, during the so-called Xian Incident, Chiang Kai-shek was taken prisoner in Xian, China, by Manchurian forces and forced to negotiate a cessation of the Civil War and the creation of the Second United Front—unifying the GMD and the CCP against Japan.

国民党政府和中国共产党自 1927 年以来一直在打内战。1936年12月，西安事变，蒋介石被迫谈判停止内战，建立第二次统一战线，统一国民党和中共对抗日本。

'''

== 卢沟桥事变 (1937.7) → 日本控制北京, 天津

Tensions in North China escalated early in July 1937, as Japanese troops were conducting night exercises near the Marco Polo Bridge ten miles west of Beijing and firefights erupted between them and Chinese troops. The Japanese quickly overcame the Chinese forces and secured their control of the area around Beijing and Tianjin.

1937 年 7 月，华北的紧张局势升级，当时日本军队正在北京以西 10 英里的卢沟桥附近进行夜间演习，他们与中国军队之间爆发了交火。日本人很快就战胜了中国军队，并控制了北京和天津周边地区。

'''

== 淞沪会战 (1937. 08-11)

Chiang Kai-shek then decided to shift the fighting to the Shanghai region, where he had better forces and a seeming numerical advantage. The Japanese responded by mounting a major offensive, and by November 1937, the GMD forces had been badly mauled. After losing 250,000 troops, they retreated westward to China’s capital in Nanjing.

上海淞沪会战, 到 1937 年 11 月，国民党军队已遭到严重打击。在损失25万军队后，他们撤退到南京。

'''

==  南京大屠杀 (1937.12)

Japanese forces closed in on Nanjing, and Chinese troops continued to retreat westward. On December 12, 1937, Chinese resistance at Nanjing ceased, and Japanese troops entered the defenseless city, commencing a terrifying sevenweek reign of terror and plunder. The tragedy became known as the “Rape of Nanking” (the older spelling of Nanjing) and was taken up at the Tokyo War Crimes trials after the war.

日军逼近南京，中国军队继续向西撤退。 1937 年 12 月 12 日，中国在南京的抵抗停止，日军进入这座毫无防备的城市，开始了长达七周的恐怖和掠夺统治. 即“南京大屠杀”，并在战后的"东京战争罪审判"中受到关注。

== 为阻止日军西进重庆, 蒋介石决堤黄河 (1938.6)

Having retreated farther west to defend the GMD’s new provisional capital at Chongqing, some GMD armies put up stiff resistance in places, but by 1938, they had been pushed back significantly. To prevent further Japanese advances, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River, flooding large portions of central China, killing an estimated 400,000 people and dislocating ten million more.

为了保卫国民党新的临时首都"重庆"，部分国民党军队向西撤退，在一些地方进行了顽强抵抗，但到了1938年，他们已被日军大幅击退。为了阻止日本进一步进攻，蒋介石下令打开黄河堤坝，洪水淹没了中国中部的大部分地区，估计造成 40 万人死亡，1000 万人流离失所。

'''

== 二战后, 道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟 对日本的改造 (1946-1952)

As supreme commander for the Allied powers, General Douglas MacArthur was ordered to exercise authority during the Allied occupation of Japan through the Japanese governmental system, including Emperor Hirohito.

MacArthur charged the Japanese government to immediately repeal the Peace Preservation Law, which allowed for the arrest of anyone perceived to be posing a threat to— or critical of—the Japanese government, and to begin open and free discussion of the entire Imperial government and its institutions. Political prisoners were released, and the Special Police were disbanded.

作为盟军最高统帅，道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军在盟军占领日本期间, 受命通过"包括裕仁天皇在内的日本政府", 来系统行使权力。

麦克阿瑟要求日本政府立即废除《和平维护法》，该法允许逮捕任何"被认为对日本政府构成威胁或批评的人"，并开始对整个帝国政府及其政权, 进行公开和自由的讨论。政治犯被释放，特别警察被解散。

For six years, from 1946 to 1952, the United States dominated the occupation of Japan. General MacArthur and his occupation authorities partnered energetically in almost all aspects of Japanese politics, economics, and society to try to reform and rebuild Japan. The overall goals of the occupation were demilitarization, democratization, and the fostering of respect for fundamental human rights.

The Constitution imposed by MacArthur and his Government Section in 1947 was the sort of fundamental change no single group in Japan itself could have effected. The fact that it has survived virtually unchanged suggests that the Japanese themselves came to terms with it and bent the system to reflect their habits of mind and politics. The emperor was made a figurehead, “the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.” Real sovereign power was vested in the people via the Diet, an elected two-chamber legislature. An extensive Bill of Rights guaranteed academic freedom, women’s suffrage, the right to choose residence, collective bargaining, and full employment.

从1946年到1952年的六年时间里，美国主导了对日本的占领。麦克阿瑟将军和他的占领当局, 在日本政治、经济和社会的几乎所有方面, 都积极合作，试图改革和重建日本。占领的总体目标是非军事化、民主化, 和促进对基本人权的尊重。

麦克阿瑟和他的政府部门于 1947 年制定的宪法, 是日本任何一个团体都无法实现的根本性变革。事实上，至今它都几乎没有改变，这表明日本人自己接受了它，并改变了这个制度，以反映他们的思想和政治习惯。天皇成了象征性的有名无实的领袖，“是国家和人民团结的象征”。真正的主权权力, 是通过议会（一个选举产生的两院立法机构）赋予人民的。内容广泛的《权利法案》保障了学术自由、妇女选举权、选择居住地的权利、集体谈判权, 和充分就业。
