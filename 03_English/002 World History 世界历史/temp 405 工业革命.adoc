In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the world’s great oceans effectively became highways. Communities in Asia, Africa, and the Americas that had once had little or no contact with one another now found themselves enmeshed in a variety of exchanges. Confronted with a changing world, every community made hard decisions.

在十八和十九世纪，世界上的大海实际上变成了高速公路. 亚洲、非洲和美洲的社区曾经彼此很少或根本没有接触，现在却发现自 己陷入了各种各样的交流之中。面对不断变化的世界，每个社区都做出了艰难的决定。

In the early 1500s, Europeans began founding new settlements in the Americas. Some came to get rich, others to win glory for their empires, a few to spread their faith.

1500 年代初期，欧洲人开始在美洲建立新的定居点。有些人是为了致富，有些人是为了为自己的帝国 赢得荣耀，还有一些人是为了传播他们的信仰。

The Spanish were the first to establish major colonies in North America after Christopher Columbus’s arrival in 1492. They became the earliest Europeans to force the Indigenous population to labor for them, initially by outright enslavement, a practice that slowly evolved into systems that were more complex. By 1502, they had created the encomienda system.

1492 年克里斯托弗·哥伦布(Christopher Columbus) 抵达后，西班牙人是第一个在北美建立主要殖民地 的人。他们成为最早强迫原住民为他们劳动的欧洲人，最初是通过彻底的奴役，这种做法慢慢演变成 后来的制度。更复杂。到 1502 年，他们创建了赐封制度

The term encomienda comes from the Spanish word encomendar, which means “to entrust.” The encomienda was a system of entrusting valuable territories and peoples to those who had proven to the crown that they were worthy of that trust. The Spanish government gave each grantee, known as an encomendero, the right to demand labor from Indigenous people living in a specific area. In exchange, the Spaniards were supposed to provide guidance, education, and leadership to these Native Americans. While encomiendas did not technically include the ownership of any land, encomenderos often took possession of lands where the people under their control lived. Sometimes the system of forced labor even devolved into what was functionally, if not legally, slavery.

encomienda一词源自西班牙语encomendar ，意思是“委托”。封建制是一种将宝贵的领土和人民托付 给那些已向国王证明值得信任的人的制度。西班牙政府赋予每个受赠者（称为encomendero ）向居住 在特定地区的原住民要求劳动力的权利。作为交换，西班牙人应该为这些美洲原住民提供指导、教育 和领导。虽然从技术上讲，encomiendas 并不包括任何土地的所有权，但encomiendas经常占有其控 制下的人民居住的土地。有时，强迫劳动制度甚至演变成功能上（如果不是法律上的）奴隶制。

The encomienda system became the dominant source of labor in Spanish American colonies.

封地制度成为西班牙美洲殖民地的主要劳动力来源

…​written by Christopher Columbus in 1492:

They neither carry nor know anything of arms, for I showed them swords, and they took them by the blade and cut themselves through ignorance. They have no iron. They should be good servants and intelligent, for I observed that they quickly took in what was said to them, and I believe that they would easily be made Christians, as it appeared to me that they had no religion.

These people are very simple as regards the use of arms. With fifty men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them.

克里斯托弗·哥伦布 (Christopher Columbus) 于 1492 年撰写，

他们既不携带武器，也不知道任何 武器，因为我向他们展示了剑，他们拿着剑，因无知而割伤了自己。他们没有铁. 他们应该是 好仆人和聪明人，因为我观察到他们很快就接受了对他们所说的话，我相信他们很容易 成为基督徒，因为在我看来他们没有宗教信仰。(人善被人欺. 人家第一时间就会在判断你, 比较并定位下你与他们的地位高低.) 这些人在使用武器方面非常简单. 只要有五十个人，他们就都可以被征服并被迫做他 们所要求的事情。

The Spanish often mistreated Native Americans, but writers from Spain’s colonial rivals, most notably the English, frequently exaggerated Spanish cruelty to justify their own colonial abuses. Despite their intense rivalries, both the English and the Spanish were guilty of abusing Native Americans. Even reformers like Las Casas, who opposed the worst abuses of Native Americans, were flawed. Las Casas’s approach to Native Americans was often paternalistic, and he typically treated non-Europeans as children who would benefit from the benevolent guidance of Europeans rather than as equals.

。西班牙人经常虐待 美洲原住民，但来自西班牙殖民竞争对手（尤其是英国人）的作家经常夸大西班牙人的残酷行为，以 证明自己的殖民虐待行为是正当的。尽管竞争激烈，英国人和西班牙人都犯有虐待美洲原住民的罪 行。即使像拉斯卡萨斯这样反对对美洲原住民最严重虐待的改革者也有缺陷。拉斯卡萨斯对美洲原住 民的态度往往是家长式的，他通常将非欧洲人视为可以从欧洲人的仁慈指导中受益的孩子，而不是平 等对待。

The English began their colonization efforts in the Americas nearly a century after the Spanish, motivated by both economic and ideological goals. In 1584, Queen Elizabeth gave Sir Walter Raleigh a charter, a royal document that authorized him to establish a colony in North America. The Protestant queen wanted colonies that would act as an ideological counterweight to Spanish Catholicism in the Americas and provide a base of operations for privateering expeditions that would raid Spanish shipping.

英国人在经济和意识形态目标的推动下，比西班牙人晚近一个世纪才开始在美洲进行殖民活动。 1584 年，伊丽莎白女王授予沃尔特·罗利爵士一份特许状，这是一份皇家文件，授权他在北美建立殖民地。 这位新教女王希望殖民地能够在意识形态上平衡西班牙天主教在美洲的地位，并为袭击西班牙航运的 私掠探险提供行动基地。

Roanoke Island 罗阿诺克岛

In July 1587, about 150 settlers led by explorer and artist John White established a colony on Roanoke Island, off the coast of modern North Carolina. In late August, White left for England with plans to gather additional investors to fund the colony. Once there, he convinced English merchants to invest in the colony in exchange for trading rights, but the arrival of the Spanish Armada in 1588 delayed his departure. When White finally returned to Roanoke Island in 1590, the colony was gone.

1587 年 7 月，在探险家兼艺术家约翰·怀特(John White) 的带领下，约 150 名定居者在现代北卡罗来纳 州海岸附近的罗阿诺克岛建立了殖民地。八月下旬，怀特前往英国，计划召集更多 投资者为该殖民地提供资金。到达那里后，他说服英国商人在该殖民地投资以换取贸易权，但 1588 年 西班牙无敌舰队的到来推迟了他的离开。 1590 年，当怀特最终返回罗阿诺克岛时，这个殖民地已经消 失了。

The only clue White found was the word “Croatoan” carved into a tree. It is also possible the word had nothing to do with the colony’s disappearance. Today, Roanoke Island is known as “the lost colony,” and its fate remains a mystery.

怀特发现的唯一线索是刻在一棵树上的“克罗地亚人”这个词。也有可能这个词与殖民地的消失无关。。如今，罗阿诺克岛被称为“失落的殖民地”，其命运仍然是个谜。

Jamestown 詹姆斯敦

The creation of joint stock companies provided English colonial efforts after Roanoke Island with improved funding that the English monarchy could not offer. A joint stock company, much like a modern corporation, raised money for its ventures by selling shares to investors. The company then used the pooled funds to conduct operations, including colonization efforts in the Americas. Shareholders were not legally liable for the actions of the company and could not lose more than the amount of their investment, but they could earn large profits if the joint stock company were successful. The combination of limited liability with the possibility of rich returns made joint stock companies an appealing investment for members of England’s growing merchant class, and the companies raised huge sums of money beginning in the early 1600s. England promoted colonization for religious and political reasons, but its reliance on private investors for funding often steered the effort toward profitable activities.

股份公司的创建为英国在罗阿诺克岛之后的殖民努力提供了英国君主制无法提供的更好的资金。股份 公司与现代公司非常相似，通过向投资者出售股票为其企业筹集资金。然后，该公司利用集合资金开 展业务，包括在美洲的殖民活动。股东对公司的行为不承担法律责任，损失也不会超过其投资额，但 如果股份公司成功，他们可以获得巨额利润。有限责任与丰厚回报的可能性相结合，使得股份公司成 为对英格兰不断壮大的商人阶层成员有吸引力的投资，并且这些公司从 1600 年代初期开始就筹集了巨 额资金。英国出于宗教和政治原因推动殖民化，但其对私人投资者资金的依赖往往将努力转向有利可 图的活动。

In 1606, the Virginia Company, a joint stock company named for Queen Elizabeth (who was known as the “virgin queen” because she never married), received a charter and sent 144 men and boys to North America. In 1607, these colonists founded Jamestown, named for the new English king, James I, on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay in what is now Virginia. Many of the settlers were the desperate younger sons of elite families who would not inherit property claimed by their older brothers in England. Many others were artisans, including goldsmiths and jewelers, unused to the hard physical labor that building a colony on a new continent required.

1606年，弗吉尼亚公司，一家以伊丽莎白女王（因未婚而被称为“童贞女王”）命名的股份公司，获得 了一份特许状，将144名男子和男孩送往北美。 1607 年，这些殖民者在切萨皮克湾（现在的弗吉尼亚 州）沿岸建立了詹姆斯敦，以新任英国国王詹姆斯一世的名字命名。许多定居者都是精英家庭绝望的 小儿子，他们不愿继承英格兰哥哥所拥有的财产。其他许多人都是工匠，包括金匠和珠宝商，他们不 习惯在新大陆上建立殖民地所需的艰苦体力劳动。

The settlers of Jamestown, like many Europeans of the 1600s and 1700s, rooted their economic ideas in mercantilism, an economic theory in which the world’s wealth, as measured in gold and silver, is assumed to be finite, so a gain of wealth for one nation is a loss for another. Mercantilist nations expected their colonies to export raw materials, most importantly precious metals like gold and silver, back to the home country and to purchase goods from it in turn. The English government hoped the Virginia Company would find gold to improve the nation’s trade balances and increase its wealth. Many in Jamestown also hoped to find gold and thereby get rich without having to work hard or suffer any hardships.

詹姆斯敦的定居者与 1600 年代和 1700 年代的许多欧洲人一样，将他们的经济思想植根于重商主义， 这是一种经济理论，其中以黄金和白银衡量的世界财富被认为是有限的，因此一个人获得财富是一种 财富。国家是另一个国家的损失。重商主义国家希望他们的殖民地将原材料（最重要的是金银等贵金 属）出口回母国，然后再从母国购买商品。英国政府希望弗吉尼亚公司能够找到黄金来改善国家的贸 易平衡并增加财富。詹姆斯敦的许多人也希望找到黄金，从而无需辛苦工作或遭受任何苦难即可致 富。

The Jamestown settlers did not find gold because there was little mineral wealth in the region, but they did find suffering due to bad weather, starvation, disease, internal political disputes, and military conflicts with the Powhatan tribe (named after its chief). The Powhatans grew to loathe the newcomers for bringing disease and violence to their homeland. Many colonists died during the winter of 1609–1610, known as “the starving time.” By May 1610, fewer than a hundred remained, and the colony, which had not produced a profit for the Virginia Company, almost failed.

詹姆斯敦的定居者没有找到黄金，因为该地区几乎没有矿产资源，但他们确实因恶劣天气、饥饿、疾 病、内部政治争端以及与波瓦坦部落（以其酋长的名字命名）的军事冲突而遭受苦难。波瓦坦人逐渐 厌恶这些新来者，因为他们给他们的家园带来了疾病和暴力。许多殖民者在 1609 年至 1610 年的冬天 死亡，被称为“饥饿时期”。到 1610 年 5 月，只剩下不到一百人，这个殖民地没有为弗吉尼亚公司带来 利润，几乎失败了。

Early Virginia colonists did find wealth and success in tobacco cultivation, however. By 1614 Jamestown began exporting tobacco to Europe and earning profits for the Virginia Company.

然而，早期的弗吉尼亚殖民者确实在烟草种植中找到了财富和成功。到 1614 年，詹姆斯敦开始向欧洲出口烟草，为弗吉尼亚公司赚取利润

Like their rivals the Spanish, English colonists struggled to produce agricultural goods using only their own labor. Instead, they relied heavily on indentured servants, European immigrants who typically agreed to work four to seven years in exchange for transportation to the colony and the hope of a new life there after completing their service. Up to 100,000 people, mostly poor men in their twenties, traveled to the English colonies as indentured servants in the 1600s. Many died of disease, exposure, and overwork.

与他们的竞争对手西班牙人一样，英国殖民者仅依靠自己的劳动力就难以生产农产品。相反，他们严 重依赖契约仆人，欧洲移民通常同意工作四到七年，以换取前往殖民地的交通以及完成服务后在那里 开始新生活的希望。 1600 年代，多达 10 万人以契约仆人的身份前往英国殖民地，其中大多数是二十 多岁的穷人。许多人死于疾病、暴露和过度劳累，

European colonists in Virginia, like those in Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean, sought ways to maintain a permanent labor force, especially when it proved difficult to recruit sufficient indentured servants from Europe. Attempts to coerce the labor of fellow Europeans would have met with too much resistance. Faced with a growing underclass of embittered poor White former servants, who in 1676 sought to overthrow the colony’s government, Virginia’s elite sought to solve their problems by drawing legal distinctions between people of European and African ancestry. They extended privileges to Whites that were denied to Blacks and encouraged European settlers to perceive Africans as inferior people fit only for manual labor, while simultaneously depriving Africans of their freedom. In this way, slavery became associated with African ancestry and racial divisions were created that had not existed before. Racism became the basis on which the colonial labor system was built.

弗吉尼亚州的欧洲殖民者，就像墨西哥、南美和加勒比地区的殖民者一样，寻求维持永久劳动力的方 法，特别是当事实证明很难从欧洲招募足够的契约仆人时。强迫欧洲同胞劳动的企图会遇到太多阻 力。面对越来越多的下层阶级，他们是1676年试图推翻殖民地政府的、怨恨的、贫穷的白人前仆人， 弗吉尼亚的精英们试图通过在法律上区分欧洲和非洲血统的人来解决他们的问题。他们向白人提供了 黑人所没有的特权，并鼓励欧洲定居者将非洲人视为只能从事体力劳动的低等人，同时又剥夺了非洲 人的自由。通过这种方式，奴隶制与非洲血统联系在一起，并产生了以前不存在的种族分歧。种族主 义成为建立殖民地劳工制度的基础。

In 1680, the Virginia legislature passed “an act for preventing Negroes Insurrections” that forbid enslaved Africans from carrying weapons, gathering in public, and traveling without permission.

This enslavement in the United States ended only in 1865, after a devastating civil war and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Slavery continued in other parts of the Western Hemisphere, with Brazil not abolishing it until 1888.

1680年，弗吉尼亚立法机关通过了“一项防止黑人叛乱的法案”，禁止被奴役的非洲人携带武器、在公 共场合集会和未经许可旅行 (防止串联，即防止私下搞阴谋商量)。 美国的这种奴役直到 1865 年经历了一场毁灭性的内战和美国宪法第十三修 正案的通过后才结束。奴隶制在西半球其他地区继续存在，巴西直到 1888 年才废除奴隶制。

New England 新英格兰

In 1620, Puritan Separatists led by William Bradford left Plymouth, England, on the Mayflower and founded a colony they called Plymouth near what is now Boston, Massachusetts. The Separatists wanted to leave England to escape the Church of England.

Before landing, their leaders signed the Mayflower Compact. More than just a religious document, the Mayflower Compact also had a major political impact with its support of direct democracy and of building governments that reflected the will of the people.

1620 年，威廉·布拉德福德(William Bradford) 领导的清教徒分离主义者乘五月花号离开英国普利茅 斯，在现马萨诸塞州波士顿附近建立了一个殖民地，称为普利茅斯。分离主义者想要离开英格兰，以 逃避英国国教. 登陆前， 他们的领导人签署了《五月花号公约》.《五月花号公约》不仅仅是一份宗教文件，它还具有重大的 政治影响，因为它支持直接民主和建立反映人民意愿的政府。

A larger group of Puritans followed in 1630 and founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Their leader John Winthrop gave a speech titled “A Model of Christian Charity,” which expressed his hopes that the Puritan community in the Americas would embrace the twin goals of building economic prosperity and founding a “City upon a Hill” that would serve as a shining example of an ideal Christian community to the entire world.

1630 年，更多的清教徒跟随并建立了马萨诸塞湾殖民地。他们的领袖约翰·温思罗普发表了题为“基督 教慈善的典范”的演讲，表达了他希望美洲清教徒社区能够实现建设经济繁荣和建立“山上之城”的双重 目标的愿望。全世界理想基督教社区的光辉典范。

The Puritan colonies were also scenes of religious conflict from which dissenters like Anne Hutchinson, who questioned the all-male church leadership, and Roger Williams, who championed religious toleration, were exiled. The Massachusetts Bay Colony’s darkest moment may have come during the 1692 Salem witch trials, when Puritan leaders executed nineteen people for witchcraft. Despite such conflicts, the Puritan colonies eventually became self-sustaining communities that mostly achieved their twin objectives of promoting Puritan religious ideology and building a strong economy.

清教徒殖民地也是宗教冲突的场所，像质疑全男性教会领导层的安妮·哈钦森（Anne Hutchinson）和 倡导宗教宽容的罗杰·威廉姆斯（Roger Williams）等持不同政见者都被流放。马萨诸塞湾殖民地最黑 暗的时刻可能发生在 1692 年塞勒姆女巫审判期间，当时清教徒领袖以巫术罪处决了 19 人。尽管存在 这些冲突，清教徒殖民地最终还是成为了自给自足的社区，大部分实现了推广清教徒宗教意识形态和 建立强大经济的双重目标。

Puritan settlers hoped a strong economy would allow their colony to flourish, attract new settlers, and provide evidence of God’s favor. Like many Europeans of the 1600s and 1700s, they rooted their economic ideas in mercantilism. The desire to build economic wealth was the primary motive in many colonial ventures, such as Jamestown in Virginia, and provided a secondary motivation in more ideologically driven communities like those set up by the Puritans.

清教徒定居者希望强大的经济能够让他们的殖民地繁荣发展，吸引新的定居者，并提供上帝恩惠的证 据。像 1600 年代和 1700 年代的许多欧洲人一样，他们的经济思想植根于重商主义。建立经济财富的 愿望是许多殖民事业的主要动机，例如弗吉尼亚州的詹姆斯敦，而在更多受意识形态驱动的社区（例 如清教徒建立的社区）中提供了次要动机。

French and Dutch Settlements 法国和荷兰定居点

In 1609, Dutch merchants hired Henry Hudson, an English sea captain, to lead an expedition into the Atlantic Ocean. The Dutch hoped Hudson would find the long-sought Northwest Passage, a mythical water route thought to allow ships from Europe to sail west through the North American continent, cross the Pacific Ocean, and arrive in Asia. Hudson discovered a deep-water port, now known as New York harbor, and a large river, now known as the Hudson, that led inland. For a moment it appeared he had found the Northwest Passage. However, the Hudson River became too shallow for ocean-going ships near present-day Albany, New York, and the expedition turned back. Hudson did not find the Northwest Passage, but he did find a valuable port and rich river valley that he claimed for the Dutch.

1609年，荷兰商人聘请英国船长亨利·哈德逊率领一支探险队进入大西洋。荷兰人希望哈德逊能够找到 一直在寻找的西北航道，这是一条神话般的水路，被认为可以让欧洲的船只向西航行，穿过北美大 陆，穿越太平洋，到达亚洲。哈德逊发现了一个深水港，现在称为纽约港，以及一条通往内陆的大 河，现在称为哈德逊河。有一瞬间，他似乎找到了西北航道。然而，哈德逊河变得太浅，无法在现今 纽约州奥尔巴尼附近的远洋船只航行，探险队因此折返。哈德逊没有找到西北航道，但他确实找到了 一个有价值的港口和富饶的河谷，他声称这些是荷兰人的权利。

After Hudson returned to Europe, the Dutch West India Company, a joint stock company much like the Virginia Company, made plans to set up a small colony in North America. In contrast to the settled agricultural model preferred by English colonists, the Dutch focused on trade. Company directors hoped their colony would improve their access to the North American fur trade, ensure their control of the valuable port eventually known as New York Harbor, and solidify their claim on the area, which they suspected might contain additional sources of wealth they had not yet discovered. In 1624, thirty families aboard the ship Nieu Nederlandt arrived in what is now New York and founded the Dutch colony of New Netherlands. They came for many reasons, but many hoped to become rich by working in the fur trade.

哈德逊返回欧洲后，荷兰西印度公司（一家类似于弗吉尼亚公司的股份公司）计划在北美建立一个小 型殖民地。与英国殖民者喜欢的定居农业模式相反，荷兰人专注于贸易。公司董事希望他们的殖民地 能够改善他们进入北美毛皮贸易的机会，确保他们对最终被称为纽约港的宝贵港口的控制，并巩固他 们对该地区的主权，他们怀疑该地区可能蕴藏着他们所没有的额外财富来源却发现了。 1624 年， Nieu Nederlandt号船上的 30 个家庭抵达现在的纽约，并建立了荷兰殖民地新荷兰。他们来到这里的原 因有很多，但许多人希望通过从事毛皮贸易致富。

The Dutch, like their Spanish and English colonial rivals, struggled to produce goods using paid labor and sought to remedy the problem with the importation of enslaved Africans. They also encouraged immigration from across Europe with promises of economic opportunities and some level of religious toleration that extended even to Jewish people, who faced severe discrimination in most of Europe. New Netherlands soon became a prosperous colony populated by people from across Europe and Africa. Colonists lived in a band of farms and towns stretching along the Hudson River Valley from New Amsterdam, which is now New York City, north to the village of Beverwijck, now Albany. They engaged in some farming, but they mostly relied on the fur trade for their income.

荷兰人像他们的西班牙和英国殖民对手一样，努力利用有偿劳动力生产商品，并试图通过进口被奴役 的非洲人来解决这个问题。他们还鼓励来自欧洲各地的移民，承诺提供经济机会和一定程度的宗教宽 容，甚至包括犹太人，他们在欧洲大部分地区面临严重歧视。新荷兰很快成为一个繁荣的殖民地，居 住着来自欧洲和非洲各地的人们。殖民者居住在哈德逊河谷沿岸的一系列农场和城镇中，从新阿姆斯 特丹（现在的纽约市）一直延伸到贝弗韦克村（现在的奥尔巴尼）。他们从事一些农业，但主要依靠 毛皮贸易获得收入。

New Amsterdam was founded by the Dutch in 1624, at the southern tip of the island now known as Manhattan. The city quickly became a thriving center of trade and commerce. In 1664, an English military expedition captured the city and renamed it New York. 新阿姆斯特丹由荷兰人于 1624 年在现称为曼哈顿岛的南端建立。该城市迅速成为繁荣的贸易 和商业中心。 1664年，一支英国远征军占领了这座城市，并将其更名为纽约

The French became aware of colonization opportunities in North America in 1534, when Jacques Cartier voyaged to the area now known as the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in Canada, but they did not rush to set up any colonies. Several early colonization efforts in what is now Canada struggled, mostly due to the harsh northern environment. In 1608, an expedition led by Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec, the first major French settlement in North America. The Company of New France, a joint stock company much like the Virginia Company and the Dutch West India Company, led the early French colonization efforts in North America and helped fund settlements. New France was a collection of French settlements begun in 1534 in what is now Newfoundland. It eventually included much of North America, including Canada and the Mississippi River Valley all the way to southern Louisiana on the Gulf of Mexico.

1534年，当雅克·卡地亚 (Jacques Cartier)航行到现在被称为加拿大圣劳伦斯湾的地区时，法国人意识 到了北美的殖民机会，但他们并没有急于建立任何殖民地。在现在的加拿大地区，早期的几次殖民努 力都举步维艰，主要是由于北部环境恶劣。 1608 年，塞缪尔·德·尚普兰 (Samuel de Champlain)率领 的探险队建立了魁北克，这是法国在北美的第一个主要定居点。新法兰西公司是一家股份公司，很像 弗吉尼亚公司和荷兰西印度公司，领导了法国在北美的早期殖民活动，并为定居点提供了资金。新法 兰西是 1534 年在现在的纽芬兰地区开始建立的法国定居点的集合。它最终涵盖了北美大部分地区，包 括加拿大和密西西比河谷，一直到墨西哥湾的路易斯安那州南部。

Like the Dutch, French colonizers focused on trade rather than the settled agricultural model preferred by the English. They earned most of their profits from the lucrative fur market and engaged in fishing off the coast of what is now Canada.

与荷兰人一样，法国殖民者也注重贸易，而不是英国人喜欢的定居农业模式。他们的大部分利润来自 利润丰厚的毛皮市场，并在现在的加拿大海岸从事捕鱼活动。

The French probably enjoyed the friendliest relationships with Native Americans of any European colonizers. Unlike their rivals, they usually attempted to solve the shortage of labor by allying themselves with Native Americans. Also, because few French women came to New France, many French colonists married Native American women, leading to the creation of a multicultural and multiracial society.

在所有欧洲殖民者中，法国人与美洲原住民的关系可能是最友好的。与竞争对手不同，他们通常试图 通过与美洲原住民结盟来解决劳动力短缺问题。此外，由于很少有法国 妇女来到新法兰西，许多法国殖民者与美洲原住民妇女结婚，导致了多元文化和多种族社会的建立。

In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister to King Louis XIII, provided a spiritual justification for Franco-Indian partnerships in the Ordonnance of 1627. The Ordonnance read in part, “The descendants of the French who are accustomed to this country [New France], together with all the Indians who will be brought to the knowledge of the faith and will profess it, shall be deemed and renowned natural Frenchmen, and as such may come to live in France when they want, and acquire, donate, and succeed and accept donations and legacies, just as true French subjects, without being required to take letters of declaration of naturalization.”

1627 年，国王路易十三的首席大臣黎塞留红衣主教在1627 年法令中为法印伙伴关系提供了精神理 由。法令的部分内容是：“习惯了这个国家（新法国）的法国人的后裔，以及所有将了解该信仰并承认 该信仰的印第安人，应被视为著名的自然法国人。 ，因此可以在他们想要的时候来法国生活，获得、 捐赠、成功并接受捐赠和遗产，就像真正的法国臣民一样，而无需携带入籍声明书。” (如同香港人即视为英国人)

In the mid-1700s, the British Empire grew from a minor player on the world stage to a dominant superpower. Victory in the Seven Years’ War consolidated their power over European rivals. In hopes of further increasing their political and economic power, many supported further expansion of the empire into new areas. Britain therefore expanded its colonies in India and turned its eyes to China.

1700年代中期，大英帝国从世界舞台上的一个小角色成长为一个占主导地位的超级大国。七年战争的胜利巩固 了他们对欧洲对手的实力。为了进一步增强政治和经济实力，许多人支持帝国进一步向新领域扩张。 英国因此扩大在印度的殖民地，并将目光转向中国。

The Seven Years’ War 七年战争

The Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) was a global conflict that began as a fight for dominance between European powers, primarily Great Britain and France, but it quickly involved groups from India, Africa, and the Americas. Conflicts that overlapped with the Seven Years’ War were the French and Indian War in North America and the Third Carnatic War in India. 七年战争（1756-1763）是一场全球性冲突，最初是欧洲列强（主要是英国和法国）之间争夺统治地位 的战争，但很快印度、非洲和美洲的团体也卷入其中。与七年战争重叠的冲突是北美的法 印战争和印度的第三次卡纳提克战争。

In the late 1600s and early 1700s, New France grew steadily. In 1663, King Louis XIV canceled the royal charter with the Company of New France and transformed the settlement into a royal colony. French merchants and priests gradually expanded their reach from Quebec through the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River, founding New Orleans near the Gulf of Mexico in 1718.

在 1600 年代末和 1700 年代初，新法兰西稳步发展。 1663年，路易十四国王取消了与新法兰西公司 的皇家特许状，并将该定居点转变为皇家殖民地。法国商人和牧师逐渐将他们的势力范围从魁北克省 穿过五大湖区一直沿密西西比河而下，于 1718 年在墨西哥湾附近建立了新奥尔良。

The English proved a serious obstacle for the growth of New France, however. Wealthy farmers in the English colonies of North America wanted to expand into the Ohio River Valley, territory claimed by France and its Native American allies. In 1754, violence broke out between French soldiers and members of the Virginia militia near what is now Uniontown, Pennsylvania. Initially the French and their Native American allies performed well, launching skillful ambushes on English troops and forcing George Washington, a young officer in the Virginia colonial militia, to surrender Britain’s Fort Necessity.

然而，英国人被证明是新法兰西发展的严重障碍。北美英国殖民地的富裕农民希望向俄亥俄河谷扩 张，法国及其美洲原住民盟友声称拥有该地区的领土。 1754 年，法国士兵和弗吉尼亚民兵成员在现宾 夕法尼亚州尤宁敦附近爆发了暴力事件。最初，法国人和他们的美洲原住民盟友表现出色，对英国军 队发动了巧妙的伏击，迫使弗吉尼亚殖民地民兵的年轻军官乔治·华盛顿投降了英国的尼塞西提堡。

The British turned in the tide in 1759, with a series of victories culminating in their capture of French Quebec after the Battle on the Plains of Abraham.

1759 年，英国扭转了局势，取得了一系列胜利，最终在亚伯拉罕平原 战役后占领了法属魁北克。

The French and Indian War ended with the victory of Great Britain and Prussia over France and Spain in the Seven Years’ War and the signing of the Treaty of Paris in February 1763. Under the treaty, the French government surrendered all its territory in North America, as well as outposts in the Caribbean, India, and Africa. Britain became the undisputed controller of eastern North America, from Canada in the north to the Florida border in the south, and from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Mississippi River in the west.

法印战争以英国和普鲁士在七年战争中战胜法国和西班牙而结束，并于 1763 年 2 月签署《巴黎条约》 。根据该条约，法国政府交出了其在北美的全部领土。以及加勒比海、印度和非洲的前哨基地。英国 成为北美东部无可争议的控制者，北起加拿大，南至佛罗里达边境，东起大西洋，西至密西西比河。

The Seven Years’ War had begun in Europe in 1756 when Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Saxony and annexed the area as part of his broader plan to expand Prussian territory. In response, France, Spain, and Russia joined forces with Austria to oppose him. Great Britain allied itself with Prussia to maintain the balance of power in Europe, a situation in which competing nations have approximately equal military power. Maintaining this balance was a key feature of British foreign policy meant to prevent the domination of Europe by any one nation. Military alliances thus transformed what could have been a small border dispute in Europe into a major war that quickly spread around the world.

1756 年，欧洲爆发了七年战争，当时普鲁士腓特烈大帝入侵萨克森并吞并了该地区，作为其扩张普鲁 士领土的更广泛计划的一部分。作为回应，法国、西班牙和俄罗斯与奥地利联手反对他。英国与普鲁 士结盟以维持欧洲的力量平衡，在这种情况下，竞争国家拥有大致平等的军事力量。保持这种平衡是 英国外交政策的一个关键特征，旨在防止任何一个国家统治欧洲。因此，军事联盟将欧洲的一场小规 模边界争端转变为一场迅速蔓延到世界各地的重大战争

In 1758, a British expeditionary force captured the French outpost of Senegal in West Africa, and other French outposts were taken during a series of subsequent offensives. The loss of valuable trading ports damaged the French economy at the very moment France desperately needed money to fund the war effort. More importantly, it deprived French military forces of strategic bases they could have used to raid British shipping and resupply their warships.

1758年，英国远征军占领了法国在西非的塞内加尔前哨，并在随后的一系列攻势中占领了法国的其他 前哨。就在法国迫切需要资金来资助战争之际，宝贵的贸易港口的丧失损害了法国经济。更重要的 是，它剥夺了法国军队本来可以用来袭击英国航运和补给军舰的战略基地。

To thwart these British advantages and gain control of valuable territory in India, the French formed an alliance with the Mughal Empire. The British defeated the French forces in 1761, however, when they captured Pondicherry, the most important French outpost in India. The Mughals continued to resist British domination even after the French had largely withdrawn from India.

。为了阻止英国的这些优势并控制印 度宝贵的领土，法国与莫卧儿帝国结盟。然而，英国在 1761 年占领了法国 在印度最重要的前哨基地本地治里，击败了法国军队。即使在法国人基本上从印度撤军之后，莫卧儿 人仍继续抵抗英国的统治

In 1762, the British launched attacks on Spanish colonies in Asia and the Caribbean, capturing the port of Manila in the Philippines and occupying it until the end of the war in 1763. They were less successful in expanding their control over the islands, despite the assistance of Indigenous Filipinos who disliked Spanish rule. In the Caribbean, however, Britain succeeded in capturing Havana, Cuba, one of the most important ports in the Western Hemisphere, and held it until the end of the conflict.

1762年，英国对西班牙在亚洲和加勒比海的殖民地发动了攻击，占领了菲律宾的马尼拉港，并一直占领到1763年战争结束。尽管有不喜欢西班牙统治的菲律宾土著居民的帮助，但他们在扩大对这些岛屿的控制方面却不太成功。然而，在加勒比地区，英国成功地占领了古巴的哈瓦那，这是西半球最重要的港口之一，并一直守到冲突结束。

With the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the French surrendered their imperial possessions in North America and India to the British, while the Spanish surrendered Florida to the British and France gave control of the Louisiana Territory to Spain. The subsequent Peace of Hubertusburg guaranteed Prussian control of Silesia, an area in central Europe, and confirmed Prussia’s status as a major force in Europe. The British, for their part, emerged from the Seven Years’ War as the world’s leading economic, military, and political power.

随着《巴黎条约》的签署，法国将北美和印度的帝国领地交给了英国，西班牙将佛罗里达交给 了英国，法国将路易斯安那领土的控制权交给了西班牙。随后的《胡伯图斯堡和约》保证了普鲁士对 中欧地区西里西亚的控制，并确立了普鲁士欧洲主力的地位。就英国而言，他们在七年战争中成为世 界领先的经济、军事和政治强国。

When investors founded the British East India Company in 1600, they initially focused on trading in spices. As spices decreased in price and profit, however, the Company turned its attention to textiles produced by highly skilled Indian artisans. Finally, when the value of hand-woven fabric began decreasing in the early nineteenth century, the company pivoted to trading Indian-produced opium for Chinesegrown tea.

当投资者于 1600 年创立英国东印度公司时， 他们最初专注于香料贸易。然而，随着香料价格和利润的下降，该公司将注意力转向由高技能印度工 匠生产的纺织品。最后，当十九世纪初手工编织物的价值开始下降时，该公司转向用印度生产的鸦片 交易中国种植的茶叶

Especially in the Chesapeake Bay colonies of Virginia and Maryland, where tobacco constituted the main cash crop, tobacco cultivation quickly drained the soil of nutrients, leading English settlers to push further westward in search of land for new fields.

，特别是在弗吉尼亚州和马里兰 州的切萨皮克湾殖民地，烟草是那里的主要经济作物。烟草种植迅速耗尽了土壤的养分，导致英国定 居者进一步向西推进，寻找新的土地。

。印度兵变让英国政府相信英 国东印度公司的所有者无法有效治理印度。政府因此废除了公司，于1858年控制了英属印度，并直接 统治该领土，直至1947年独立。1858年至1947年期间因此被称为英属印度（ raj在梵语中意为“统 治”），或英国至高无上，这意味着英国政府通过印度总督统治印度。

The Indian Mutiny convinced the British government that the owners of the British East India Company were unable to effectively govern India. The government thus abolished the company, took control of British India in 1858, and directly ruled the territory until it became independent in 1947. The period from 1858 to 1947 is therefore known as the British Raj (raj means “rule” in Sanskrit), or the British Paramountcy, which meant rule of India by the British government through the Viceroy of India.

Mercantilism, which advocated building a nation’s power by increasing trade through exports, had originally propelled colonization. But as people around the world gained their political freedom, they also became interested in economic freedom, and mercantilism fell out of favor. Capitalism, a system in which prices and costs, not government intervention, serve to regulate the supply and demand of goods traded for individual profit, became popular.

重 商主义主张通过出口增加贸易来建设国家实力，它最初推动了殖民化。但随着世界各地的人们获得了 政治自由，他们也对经济自由产生了兴趣，重商主义失宠了。资本主义是一种以价格和成本而非政府 干预来调节商品供求以获取个人利润的体系，这种体系变得流行起来。

From Mercantilism to Capitalism

从重商主义到资本主义

the concept of laissez-faire economics argues that market forces alone should drive the economy and that governments should refrain from direct intervention in or moderation of the economic system. It was effectively impossible for leaders in Europe to micromanage economic operations that were on the other side of an ocean. Therefore the evolution to a laissez-faire economic model might have been as much a practical necessity as an ideological shift.

自由放任经济学的概念，该概念认为，仅市场力量就应 该驱动经济，政府应该避免直接干预或调节经济体系。欧洲领导人实际上不可能对大洋彼岸的经济运行进行微观管理。因此，向自由放任的经济 模式的演变可能既是意识形态的转变，也是现实的必然。

Adam Smith was a Scottish political economist and philosopher best known for writing the book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), often referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations. Earlier scholars had written about various aspects of economics, but with this book Smith became the first person to produce a comprehensive philosophical examination of the way nations should manage their economies.

亚当·斯密 (Adam Smith)是一位苏格兰政治经济学家和哲学家，因撰写《国富论本质和原因的探究》 (An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations) (1776) 一书而闻名，该书通常简称为 《国富论》(看不见的手) 。早期的学者曾撰写有关经济学各个方面的文章，但通过这本书，史密斯成为第 一个对国家管理经济的方式进行全面哲学考察的人。

Although Smith did not use the term, preferring to call his system commercial society, he and his supporters promoted the idea later known as capitalism, an economic system in which private individuals and companies typically own the means of production such as factories and farms, and free (unregulated) markets set the value of most goods and services based on supply and demand. 尽管史密斯没有使用这个术语，而是更愿意将他的体系称为商业社会，但他和他的支持者提倡了后来 被称为资本主义的思想，在这种经济体系中，私人和公司通常拥有工厂和农场等生产资料，并且自由 （不受监管）市场根据供需确定大多数商品和服务的价值。

Always controversial, it remains an influential work today.

《国富论》一直备受争议，至今仍然是 一部有影响力的作品。

Mechanization

机械化

In the late 1700s, western European nations began to adopt mechanization, the use of machines to replace the labor of animals and humans. Mechanization set the stage for the Industrial Revolution, a transition away from societies focused on agriculture and handicraft production to socioeconomic systems dominated by the manufacture of goods, primarily with machines.

1700年代末，西欧国家开始采用机械化，用机器代替动物(牛耕地)和人类的劳动。机械化为工业革命奠定了基 础，工业革命从以农业和手工业生产为主的社会过渡到以机器制造商品为主的社会经济体系。

Beginning in the mid-1600s, the British enjoyed an agricultural revolution that allowed smaller numbers of farmers employing fewer farm laborers to produce a surplus of food, and that in turn led to a population increase.

从 1600 年代中期开始，英国经历了一场农业革命，允许较少数量的 农民雇用较少的农场劳动力来生产过剩的粮食，进而导致人口增加。

In the 1700s, entrepreneurs in England found a way to make use of unemployed or underemployed farm laborers and their families. These entrepreneurs provided farm families with raw materials and asked them to produce finished goods in their cottages, a system that became known as cottage labor. Rural women spun wool or flax into thread, and men then wove it into woolen cloth or linen. Some farm families made bonnets from straw. Other people made nails, knit hosiery, or made lace. The entrepreneur collected their finished products, paid them for their labor, and sold the finished goods in towns and cities. Because the farm laborers were not skilled artisans, they could not command high wages, and the entrepreneurs reaped great profits.

1700年代，英国企业家找到了利用失业或就业不足的农场工人及其家庭的方法。这些企业家为农户提 供原材料，并要求他们在自己的小屋里生产制成品，这种制度后来被称为“小屋劳动” 。农村妇女将羊 毛或亚麻纺成线，男人则将其编织成毛布或亚麻。一些农户用稻草制作帽子。其他人制作指甲、编织 袜子或制作花边。企业家收集他们的制成品，支付他们的劳动报酬，然后在城镇出售制成品。由于农 场劳动者不是熟练的工匠，他们无法获得高工资，而企业家却获得了巨大的利润。

In time, entrepreneurs began to gather laborers together in one location, a factory. This decision gave them greater control over production because they could hire managers to supervise the workers’ labor. It was also easier to install machines in factories than in laborers’ cottages. Factories came to be concentrated in towns and cities. As work moved to urban areas, so too did men and women who could not find work on farms. By the late 1700s, British business owners, supported by government policies inspired by Adam Smith, were setting up factories and hiring many of these migrant workers.

随着时间的推移，企业家开始将工人聚集在一个地方，即工厂。这一决定使他们对生产有了更大的控 制权，因为他们可以聘请经理来监督工人的劳动。在工厂安装机器也比在工人的小屋里更容易。工厂开始集中在城镇。随着工 作转移到城市地区，那些在农场找不到工作的男人和女人也转移到城市地区。到 1700 年代末，英国企 业主在亚当·斯密启发的政府政策的支持下，开始建立工厂并雇用许多移民工人。(工人跟着工作跑，而非相反。厂在哪边，住房就能在哪边，哪怕是出租屋的)

During the Industrial Revolution, factories increasingly relied on machine power, most importantly the steam engine. A steam engine uses heat to transform water into steam, which expands and drives a piston to perform work.

在工业革命期间，工厂越来越依赖机器动力，最重要的是蒸汽机。蒸汽机利用热量将水转化为蒸汽， 蒸汽膨胀并驱动活塞做功。

In 1807, American inventor Robert Fulton began operation of the first successful commercial steamboats. In 1812, Matthew Murray, an English industrialist, opened the world’s first successful steam locomotive line. However, the heavy weight of steam engines and the poor conditions of most roads doomed them to failure.

1807 年，美国 发明家罗伯特·富尔顿开始运营第一艘成功的商业汽船。 1812年，英国实业家马修·默里（Matthew Murray ）开通了世界上第一条成功的蒸汽机车生产线。但蒸汽机的重量和大多数道路的恶劣条件注定了它们的(早年岁月的)失败.

Industrialization, motivated and enabled by capitalism, created tremendous wealth for business owners and middle-class professionals, but their profits often came at a high cost to workers. The production of goods shifted from the handiwork of highly skilled middle-class artisans to mechanized production done by low-paid unskilled laborers. Workers did enjoy access to new consumer goods made cheaper by industrialization, but to afford those goods they had to work long hours, in difficult and often dangerous conditions. Perhaps most importantly, workers lost control over their working conditions. Farmers and artisans, particularly those who owned their land or shops, were free to decide how and when they worked, whereas factory owners carefully regulated every aspect of their workers’ professional and even personal lives.

在资本主义的推动和推动下，工业化为企业主和中产阶级专业人士创造了巨大的财富，但他们的利润 往往以工人的高昂成本为代价。商品生产从高技能中产阶级工匠的手工生产转向低薪非熟练工人的机 械化生产。工人们确实享受到因工业化而变得更便宜的新消费品，但为了买得起这些商品，他们必须 在困难且常常危险的条件下长时间工作。也许最重要的是，工人们失去了对工作条件的控制。农民和 工匠，特别是那些拥有土地或商店的人，可以自由决定他们工作的方式和时间，而工厂主则仔细规范 工人职业甚至个人生活的各个方面。

Some workers rebelled against industrialization, which threatened their status as skilled laborers. Beginning in 1811, a secretive group of British textile workers calling themselves Luddites began destroying textile machinery, rioting, and setting fires in response to the industrialization of their workplaces. Today, “Luddite” is often used as a generic description of anyone opposed to technological change.

一些工人反抗工业化，这威胁到他们作为熟练工人的地位。从 1811 年开始，一群自称“卢德分子”的英 国纺织工人秘密组织开始破坏纺织机械、骚乱和纵火，以应对工作场所的工业化.。如今，“卢德分子”经常 被用作对任何反对技术变革的人的通用描述。

In 1848, Marx published The Communist Manifesto with his co-author Friedrich Engels. In the book, the two argued that “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.” Their idea, that recognizing the class struggle between workers and the ruling class is central to understanding societies, is also known as Marxism.

1848年，马克思与合著者弗里德里希·恩格斯发表了《共产党宣言》 。两人在书中认为，“迄今为止一 切社会的历史都是阶级斗争的历史”。他们的观点认为认识工人和统治阶级之间的阶级斗争是理解社会 的核心，也被称为马克思主义.

In Das Kapital, Marx argued that the bourgeoisie, members of a social class that owned the means of production, were primarily motivated by the desire to exploit labor. In his view, employers paid wages to their workers, also known as the proletariat, that were far less than their labor was worth. They then kept the excess value produced by wage earners, in a process Marx argued was unfair to the workers. Employers used their profits to purchase additional resources and to buy political influence to ensure that the law would support the wealthy instead of the workers. The wealthy became unfit to rule as they increasingly leveraged their growing economic and political power until workers were left powerless and in poverty. Eventually the capitalist system would collapse.

马克思在《资本 论》(1867 年出版)中指出，资产阶级是拥有生产资料的社会阶级成员，其主要动机是剥削劳动力。在他看来，雇主 向工人（也称为无产阶级）支付的工资远远低于他们的劳动价值。然后他们保留了工资收入者创造的 超额价值，马克思认为这一过程对工人不公平。雇主用他们的利润购买额外的资源并购买政治影响 力，以确保法律支持富人而不是工人。富人越来越不适合统治，因为他们越来越多地利用其日益增长 的经济和政治权力，直到工人变得无能为力并陷入贫困。最终，资本主义制度将崩溃.

These new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements.

这些新的自由民只有在被剥夺了自己的所有生产资料和旧封建安排所提 供的所有生存保障之后才成为自己的出卖者。
