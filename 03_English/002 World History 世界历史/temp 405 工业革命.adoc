Mechanization

机械化

In the late 1700s, western European nations began to adopt mechanization, the use of machines to replace the labor of animals and humans. Mechanization set the stage for the Industrial Revolution, a transition away from societies focused on agriculture and handicraft production to socioeconomic systems dominated by the manufacture of goods, primarily with machines.

1700年代末，西欧国家开始采用机械化，用机器代替动物(牛耕地)和人类的劳动。机械化为工业革命奠定了基 础，工业革命从以农业和手工业生产为主的社会过渡到以机器制造商品为主的社会经济体系。

Beginning in the mid-1600s, the British enjoyed an agricultural revolution that allowed smaller numbers of farmers employing fewer farm laborers to produce a surplus of food, and that in turn led to a population increase.

从 1600 年代中期开始，英国经历了一场农业革命，允许较少数量的 农民雇用较少的农场劳动力来生产过剩的粮食，进而导致人口增加。

In the 1700s, entrepreneurs in England found a way to make use of unemployed or underemployed farm laborers and their families. These entrepreneurs provided farm families with raw materials and asked them to produce finished goods in their cottages, a system that became known as cottage labor. Rural women spun wool or flax into thread, and men then wove it into woolen cloth or linen. Some farm families made bonnets from straw. Other people made nails, knit hosiery, or made lace. The entrepreneur collected their finished products, paid them for their labor, and sold the finished goods in towns and cities. Because the farm laborers were not skilled artisans, they could not command high wages, and the entrepreneurs reaped great profits.

1700年代，英国企业家找到了利用失业或就业不足的农场工人及其家庭的方法。这些企业家为农户提 供原材料，并要求他们在自己的小屋里生产制成品，这种制度后来被称为“小屋劳动” 。农村妇女将羊 毛或亚麻纺成线，男人则将其编织成毛布或亚麻。一些农户用稻草制作帽子。其他人制作指甲、编织 袜子或制作花边。企业家收集他们的制成品，支付他们的劳动报酬，然后在城镇出售制成品。由于农 场劳动者不是熟练的工匠，他们无法获得高工资，而企业家却获得了巨大的利润。

In time, entrepreneurs began to gather laborers together in one location, a factory. This decision gave them greater control over production because they could hire managers to supervise the workers’ labor. It was also easier to install machines in factories than in laborers’ cottages. Factories came to be concentrated in towns and cities. As work moved to urban areas, so too did men and women who could not find work on farms. By the late 1700s, British business owners, supported by government policies inspired by Adam Smith, were setting up factories and hiring many of these migrant workers.

随着时间的推移，企业家开始将工人聚集在一个地方，即工厂。这一决定使他们对生产有了更大的控 制权，因为他们可以聘请经理来监督工人的劳动。在工厂安装机器也比在工人的小屋里更容易。工厂开始集中在城镇。随着工 作转移到城市地区，那些在农场找不到工作的男人和女人也转移到城市地区。到 1700 年代末，英国企 业主在亚当·斯密启发的政府政策的支持下，开始建立工厂并雇用许多移民工人。(工人跟着工作跑，而非相反。厂在哪边，住房就能在哪边，哪怕是出租屋的)

During the Industrial Revolution, factories increasingly relied on machine power, most importantly the steam engine. A steam engine uses heat to transform water into steam, which expands and drives a piston to perform work.

在工业革命期间，工厂越来越依赖机器动力，最重要的是蒸汽机。蒸汽机利用热量将水转化为蒸汽， 蒸汽膨胀并驱动活塞做功。

In 1807, American inventor Robert Fulton began operation of the first successful commercial steamboats. In 1812, Matthew Murray, an English industrialist, opened the world’s first successful steam locomotive line. However, the heavy weight of steam engines and the poor conditions of most roads doomed them to failure.

1807 年，美国 发明家罗伯特·富尔顿开始运营第一艘成功的商业汽船。 1812年，英国实业家马修·默里（Matthew Murray ）开通了世界上第一条成功的蒸汽机车生产线。但蒸汽机的重量和大多数道路的恶劣条件注定了它们的(早年岁月的)失败.

Industrialization, motivated and enabled by capitalism, created tremendous wealth for business owners and middle-class professionals, but their profits often came at a high cost to workers. The production of goods shifted from the handiwork of highly skilled middle-class artisans to mechanized production done by low-paid unskilled laborers. Workers did enjoy access to new consumer goods made cheaper by industrialization, but to afford those goods they had to work long hours, in difficult and often dangerous conditions. Perhaps most importantly, workers lost control over their working conditions. Farmers and artisans, particularly those who owned their land or shops, were free to decide how and when they worked, whereas factory owners carefully regulated every aspect of their workers’ professional and even personal lives.

在资本主义的推动和推动下，工业化为企业主和中产阶级专业人士创造了巨大的财富，但他们的利润 往往以工人的高昂成本为代价。商品生产从高技能中产阶级工匠的手工生产转向低薪非熟练工人的机 械化生产。工人们确实享受到因工业化而变得更便宜的新消费品，但为了买得起这些商品，他们必须 在困难且常常危险的条件下长时间工作。也许最重要的是，工人们失去了对工作条件的控制。农民和 工匠，特别是那些拥有土地或商店的人，可以自由决定他们工作的方式和时间，而工厂主则仔细规范 工人职业甚至个人生活的各个方面。

Some workers rebelled against industrialization, which threatened their status as skilled laborers. Beginning in 1811, a secretive group of British textile workers calling themselves Luddites began destroying textile machinery, rioting, and setting fires in response to the industrialization of their workplaces. Today, “Luddite” is often used as a generic description of anyone opposed to technological change.

一些工人反抗工业化，这威胁到他们作为熟练工人的地位。从 1811 年开始，一群自称“卢德分子”的英 国纺织工人秘密组织开始破坏纺织机械、骚乱和纵火，以应对工作场所的工业化.。如今，“卢德分子”经常 被用作对任何反对技术变革的人的通用描述。

In 1848, Marx published The Communist Manifesto with his co-author Friedrich Engels. In the book, the two argued that “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.” Their idea, that recognizing the class struggle between workers and the ruling class is central to understanding societies, is also known as Marxism.

1848年，马克思与合著者弗里德里希·恩格斯发表了《共产党宣言》 。两人在书中认为，“迄今为止一 切社会的历史都是阶级斗争的历史”。他们的观点认为认识工人和统治阶级之间的阶级斗争是理解社会 的核心，也被称为马克思主义.

In Das Kapital, Marx argued that the bourgeoisie, members of a social class that owned the means of production, were primarily motivated by the desire to exploit labor. In his view, employers paid wages to their workers, also known as the proletariat, that were far less than their labor was worth. They then kept the excess value produced by wage earners, in a process Marx argued was unfair to the workers. Employers used their profits to purchase additional resources and to buy political influence to ensure that the law would support the wealthy instead of the workers. The wealthy became unfit to rule as they increasingly leveraged their growing economic and political power until workers were left powerless and in poverty. Eventually the capitalist system would collapse.

马克思在《资本 论》(1867 年出版)中指出，资产阶级是拥有生产资料的社会阶级成员，其主要动机是剥削劳动力。在他看来，雇主 向工人（也称为无产阶级）支付的工资远远低于他们的劳动价值。然后他们保留了工资收入者创造的 超额价值，马克思认为这一过程对工人不公平。雇主用他们的利润购买额外的资源并购买政治影响 力，以确保法律支持富人而不是工人。富人越来越不适合统治，因为他们越来越多地利用其日益增长 的经济和政治权力，直到工人变得无能为力并陷入贫困。最终，资本主义制度将崩溃.

These new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements.

这些新的自由民只有在被剥夺了自己的所有生产资料和旧封建安排所提 供的所有生存保障之后才成为自己的出卖者。
