== 原住民的"万物有灵论"


For many Indigenous peoples, their religious belief systems were animistic, meaning the spiritual world resided not just in humans but also in animals, plants, and even rocks. This belief was very different from monotheism, in which all spiritual power resided in one single divine being.

对于许多原住民来说，许多宗教信仰体系, 都是"万物有灵论"的，这意味着精神世界不仅存在于人类之中，还存在于动物、植物, 甚至岩石中。这种信仰与"一神论"非常不同，"一神论"中所有的精神力量, 都存在于一个神圣的存在中。

Like humans, animals, and plants, the earth possessed sacred power; therefore, it could not be owned. The concept of owning land seemed nonsensical to many Indigenous groups, and their corresponding lack of emphasis on private property was one reason Europeans sometimes found it easy to lay claim to lands inhabited by native peoples.

和人类、动物、植物一样，大地也拥有神圣的力量。因此，它不能被拥有。对于许多原住民群体来说，"拥有土地"的概念似乎毫无意义，而他们相应地缺乏对私有财产的重视，这就是欧洲人有时发现"很容易对原住民居住的土地提出要求"的原因之一。

As the fortunes of Spain and Portugal declined in the seventeenth century, England, France, and the Netherlands claimed territory in Asia and the Americas and established their own trading posts on the African coast. Spain and Portugal also failed to acknowledge the rights of the Indigenous peoples in the lands they claimed. Indeed, many Europeans believed that by conquering the inhabitants of the Americas and giving them no choice but to convert to Christianity, they were saving their souls.



十七世纪，随着西班牙和葡萄牙的衰落，英国、法国和荷兰, 声称在亚洲和美洲拥有领土，并在非洲海岸建立了自己的贸易站。西班牙和葡萄牙也没有承认"原住民在他们声称拥有的土地上的权利"。事实上，许多欧洲人相信，通过征服美洲居民, 并让他们别无选择，只能皈依基督教，他们就可以拯救自己的灵魂。



Coffee and sugar cane, introduced to the Americas by Europeans, grew exceedingly well in the tropical climates of the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and the southernmost portions of North America. This need for labor eventually led to the plantation-style slavery that took hold in parts of the United States, islands in the Caribbean, and areas of South America such as Brazil.

咖啡和甘蔗, 由欧洲人引入美洲，并在加勒比海、中美洲、南美洲和北美洲最南端的热带气候中, 生长得非常好。这种对劳动力的需求, 最终导致了"种植园式奴隶制"的出现，这种奴隶制在美国部分地区、加勒比海岛屿, 以及巴西等南美洲地区盛行。



The Spanish often mistreated Native Americans, but writers from Spain’s colonial rivals, most notably the English, frequently exaggerated Spanish cruelty to justify their own colonial abuses. Despite their intense rivalries, both the English and the Spanish were guilty of abusing Native Americans. Even reformers like Las Casas, who opposed the worst abuses of Native Americans, were flawed. Las Casas’s approach to Native Americans was often paternalistic, and he typically treated non-Europeans as children who would benefit from the benevolent guidance of Europeans rather than as equals.

西班牙人经常虐待美洲原住民，但来自西班牙殖民竞争对手（尤其是英国人）的作家, 经常夸大西班牙人的残酷行为，以证明自己的殖民虐待行为是正当的。尽管竞争激烈，英国人和西班牙人都犯有虐待美洲原住民的罪 行。即使像拉斯卡萨斯这样反对对美洲原住民最严重虐待的改革者也有缺陷。拉斯卡萨斯对美洲原住 民的态度往往是家长式的，他通常将非欧洲人视为可以从欧洲人的仁慈指导中受益的孩子，而不是平 等对待。



In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the world’s great oceans effectively became highways. Communities in Asia, Africa, and the Americas that had once had little or no contact with one another now found themselves enmeshed in a variety of exchanges. Confronted with a changing world, every community made hard decisions.

在十八和十九世纪，世界上的大海实际上变成了高速公路. 亚洲、非洲和美洲的社区曾经彼此很少或根本没有接触，现在却发现自己陷入了各种各样的交流之中。面对不断变化的世界，每个社区都做出了艰难的决定。
