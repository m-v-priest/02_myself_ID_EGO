Japan was not the only nation that turned inward in the seventeenth century. China did so as well.

To prevent the dangerous effect of outside ideas and potential challenges to his rule, Hongwu decided that Chinese contact with foreign lands would consist primarily of visits by vassals from tributary states.

In 1371, all private foreign trade was forbidden. Several years later, all foreign trade officially came to an end when the Maritime Trade Intendancies’ offices in the port cities of Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Quanzhou, through which all tribute goods were to flow, were closed. Harbors were filled with rocks and wooden stakes to prevent ships from using them. Ships were destroyed or left to rot in their docks. A shore patrol was instituted to catch anyone attempting to engage in trade. Though the punishment was death, smugglers widely violated the rule.

日本并不是 17 世纪唯一一个转向内向的国家。中国也这样做了。为了防止外部思想的危险影响和对其统治的潜在挑 战，(明朝)洪武皇帝决定中国与外国土地的接触主要包括来自朝贡国的附庸国的访问。通过将贸易限制为贡 品交换，中国还希望向其他非常需要其产品的国家施加压力，迫使其满足其要求. 1371年， 所有私人对外贸易被禁止。几年后，随着所有贡品流通的宁波、广州和泉州等港口城市的海事局办事 处关闭，所有对外贸易正式结束。港口里堆满了岩石和木桩，以防止船只使用它们。船只被毁坏或留 在码头里腐烂。建立了海岸巡逻队来抓捕任何试图从事贸易的人。虽然刑罚是死刑，但走私者却广泛 违反了这一规定。

By cutting off access to foreign trade outside the tribute system, the Ming government greatly reduced its tax revenue, which left it constantly short of funds. Hongwu’s reforms, which were intended to reduce the cost of government, were largely unsuccessful.

通过切断朝贡体系之外的对外贸易，明政府大大减少了税收收入，导致资金不断短缺。(明政府)为了降低政府 成本的改革基本上不成功。

Hongwu’s son, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, dispatched Zheng He, a trusted palace eunuch, on a series of six voyages throughout the Indian Ocean. The purpose of these voyages was to demonstrate the wealth and power of China by distributing gifts to foreign rulers, thus prompting them to pledge themselves as vassals and offer tribute to the Ming emperor.

明朝第三位皇帝永乐皇帝，1405 年至 1421 年间，他派遣一位值得信赖的宫廷太监郑和进行了六次穿越印度洋的一系列航行。这 些航海的目的是通过向外国统治者分发礼物来展示中国的财富和实力，从而促使他们臣服于明朝皇帝 并进贡。

In 1430, the Xuande Emperor, the Yongle emperor’s grandson, ordered Zheng He to undertake his seventh and final voyage. These forays were China’s last significant effort to make contact with overseas lands for many decades, however. Factions at court worried about the effect of outsiders and their ideas on the empire, as well as the cost of the trips. Following Zheng He’s death, his charts and records were destroyed, and the ships of the fleet were left to rot.

1430年，永乐皇帝的孙子宣德皇帝命令郑和进行第七次也是最后一次下西洋。然而，这些尝试是几十 年来中国与海外土地进行接触的最后一次重大努力。宫廷中的各派担心外来者及其想法对帝国的影 响，以及旅行的费用。郑和死后，他的航海图和记录被毁，船队的船只也被任其腐烂。

After the 1449 defeat of the Chinese by western Mongols (known as the Oirat) at the Battle of Tumu, construction began on a new Great Wall to supplement the original Great Wall.

1449 年，中国人 在图木之战中被西部蒙古人（称为卫拉特人）击败后，开始修建新的长城，以补充原来的长城

China needed money to pay for this massive project, however, as well as such other projects as the extension of the Grand Canal to Beijing. In 1567, the Ming dynasty reversed the policy that had prohibited foreign trade, and soon European merchant ships began arriving again.

然而，中国需要资金来支付这个庞大的项目，以及其他项目，例如将大运河延伸至北 京. 1567年，明朝扭 转了禁止对外贸易的政策，很快欧洲商船又开始抵达。

China’s economy boomed, and many Chinese peasants began to focus on producing goods for the foreign market. In Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province, people mass-produced porcelain.

中国经济蓬勃发展，许多中国农民开始专注于为国外市场生产商品。在江西省景德镇，人们大量生产瓷器。

The days of the Ming were numbered. The cost of supporting the imperial family had grown astronomically. With the imperial government lacking sufficient funds to pay the army, Chinese soldiers were laid off. In 1627–1628, hungry, impoverished, and angry soldiers and peasants rose up in revolt in northern China. By 1632, violence had spread to other provinces. This made it even harder for government officials to collect taxes, which Beijing had raised in 1639, angering people even more. In April 1644, Li Zicheng’s peasant army seized Beijing.

明朝的日子已经屈指可数了。供养皇室的成本已成天文数字(朱氏子孙吃白食的太多)。由于朝廷缺乏足够的军饷，中国士兵被解雇。 1627年至1628年，中国北方饥饿、贫困、愤怒的士兵和农民起义。到了 1632 年，暴力事件已经蔓延 到其他省份。这使得政府官员征收税收变得更加困难，而北京在1639年就提高了税收，这更加激怒了 人们。1644年4月，李自成农民军占领北京。

It was not until 1683 that all of China was brought under Manchu control.

直到1683年，全中国才被满族控制。

Local positions in government were usually given to Han Chinese bureaucrats, but supervisory positions were given to Manchus. All males wore the distinctive Manchu hairstyle. After 1645, men who did not wear their hair in this fashion were subject to execution.

政府中的地方职位通常由汉 族官僚担任，但监督职位则由满族担任。所有男性还必须留着独特的满族发型. 1645年之后，不以这种方式留着头发的男 人会被处决。

Kangxi tolerated other religions, including Christianity. The Jesuits’ efforts to learn the Chinese language and their respect for Chinese culture made them more successful at winning converts than the Dominicans and Franciscans. But members of these other orders grew jealous and complained to the Pope about the Jesuits’ willingness to accommodate Chinese practices. When the Vatican ruled that all church services must be conducted in Latin and that Chinese Christians must be ordered to abandon their ancestral rites, Kangxi decreed that missionaries who complied would have to leave China.

康熙容忍其他宗教，包括基督教。耶稣会士学习中文的努力和对中国文化的尊重使 他们比多米尼加和方济各会更成功地赢得皈依。但其他修会的成员开始嫉妒，并向教皇抱怨耶稣会士 愿意迁就中国的做法。当梵蒂冈规定所有教堂仪式必须用拉丁语进行，并且必须命令中国基督徒放弃 祖先仪式时，康熙下令遵守的传教士必须离开中国。

Fearing that the Ming had succumbed to lax moral standards brought on by wealth and luxury, Qing scholars returned to the teachings of Zhu Xi. Morally suspect plays and novels were banned. Female chastity was encouraged, and so many memorial arches were erected by communities to commemorate “chaste widows,” women who had refused to remarry after the death of their husbands.

清朝学者担心明朝已经屈服于财富和奢侈带来的道德标准松懈，于是又回归了朱熹的学说。道德 上可疑的戏剧和小说被禁止. 鼓励女性贞操，社区建立了许多纪念牌坊来纪念“贞洁寡妇”，即在丈 夫去世后拒绝再婚的妇女.

The Qing, however, continued the Ming policy of interacting with other countries as little as possible. Non-Chinese were allowed to reside in Macao, but after 1759 they could conduct trade only through the port of Guangzhou and trade only with the Co-hong, the official Chinese merchant guild.

然而清朝仍然延续了明朝尽可能少与其他国家交往的政策。 非华人被允许居住在澳门，但1759年之 后，他们只能通过广州港进行贸易，并且只能与官方的中国商人行会进行贸易。

The Qing signed new treaties with foreign nations, including the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727) with Russia, which opened China to new European markets.

The Qing government lifted most prohibitions on trade with the western nations. Under the Canton system, in place from 1759 to 1842, western Europeans were permitted to trade with China if they agreed to work through the Chinese guilds that enjoyed monopoly rights to the tea and silk trades. Under this system, all trade was confined to the southern Chinese port of Canton (Guangzhou) in order to limit contact with Europeans and foreign influence on China. Only members of the merchant guild authorized to transact business with Westerners were allowed to have contact with Europeans. All Europeans trading in China were subject to Chinese law, and they were required to live and do business in a small area outside the city walls. Europeans were not allowed to bring firearms or warships into the port, and European women were also prohibited from settling in Canton, which prevented a permanent European community from taking root there.

清与俄罗斯签订的《恰克图条 约》 （1727 年），该条约为中国打开了新的欧洲市场。 清政府取消了大部分与西方国家的贸易禁令。根据1759年至1842年实行的广州体系，西欧 人如果同意通过享有茶叶和丝绸贸易垄断权的中国行会进行工作，就可以与中国进行贸易。在这种制 度下，所有贸易都仅限于中国南方的港口广州（广州），以限制与欧洲人的接触以及外国对中国的影 响。只有被授权与西方人做生意的商业行会成员才被允许与欧洲人接触。所有在中国进行贸易的欧洲 人都受到中国法律的管辖，他们被要求在城墙外的一小片区域内生活和做生意。欧洲人不得携带火器 或军舰进入港口，欧洲妇女也不得在广州定居，这阻碍了永久的欧洲共同体在那里扎根。

China rejected most European trade goods and insisted on payment for its exports in silver. Several million dollars’ worth of silver flowed into China each year. This encouraged European nations to find a way to chip away at China’s trade advantages.

中国它拒绝了大多数欧洲贸易商品，并坚持用白银支付出口费用。，每年价值数百万美元的白银流入中国。这鼓 励欧洲国家寻找削弱中国贸易优势的方法。

The British tried to end China’s positive balance of trade by importing opium into China from their territories in India.

英国试图通过从其在印度领土进口鸦片来结束中国的贸易顺差

In 1839, the Chinese government seized opium in British warehouses in Canton. In response, the British sent military forces to China with orders to impose penalties on the Chinese government and protect British merchants in a conflict later named the First Opium War. In 1842, Great Britain and China signed the Treaty of Nanjing, which forced China to surrender Hong Kong to Great Britain, opened five ports to European traders, and gave the British a favorable trading status. The Chinese were also forced to pay a huge fine. The following year, a second treaty allowed British citizens in China to be tried in British courts for violations of the law, making them immune from prosecution by Chinese authorities.

1839年，中国政府在广州的英国仓库中查获了鸦片。作为回应，英国派遣军队前往中国，奉命在一场 后来被称为第一次鸦片战争的冲突中惩罚中国政府并保护英国商人。1842年，中英签订《南京条约》 ，迫使中国将香港割让给英国，并向 欧洲商人开放五个港口，并给予英国有利的贸易地位。中国人还被迫缴纳巨额罚款。次年，第二项条 约允许在华英国公民因违法行为而在英国法院接受审判，从而免受中国当局的起诉。(治外法权)

After a brief period of relative peace, the Second Opium War broke out in 1856 after Chinese soldiers seized a British ship in Chinese waters, crewed by Chinese sailors suspected of piracy. The British demanded the immediate return of the ship and crew and an apology. The Qing government refused, and the British navy bombarded the Chinese coast. The French supported the British in hopes of gaining greater access to Chinese markets. The United States and Russia did not formally join the alliance.

1856 年，中国士兵在中国海域扣押了一艘由涉嫌海盗的中国水手驾驶的英 国船只，爆发了第二次鸦片战争。英国要求立即归还船只和船员并道歉。清政府拒绝，英国海军炮击 中国海岸。法国支持英国，希望获得更多进入中国市场的机会。美国和俄罗斯并未正式加入该联盟，

The war ended in 1860 with the Convention of Beijing, which ceded select Chinese territories to Russia, expanded the borders of British-controlled Hong Kong, prevented religious discrimination against Christians, and eliminated almost all restrictions on foreign access to China. The treaty also led to a continuous series of other treaties between the west and China—later referred to by the Chinese as “unequal treaties” because they were imposed rather than negotiated.

1860年，战争随着《北京公约》的签订而结束，该公约将部分中国领土割让给俄罗斯，扩大了英国控 制的香港的边界，防止对基督徒的宗教歧视，并取消了对外国人进入中国的几乎所有限制。该条约还 导致西方与中国之间不断签订一系列其他条约——后来被中国人称为“不平等条约”，因为它们是强加的 而不是谈判达成的。

Britain won the First Opium War (1839–1842), gaining control over Hong Kong and five other ports: Guangzhou, Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Xiamen. In 1844, China also signed treaties with France and the United States, giving them the right to trade in the five open ports and build Christian churches in and send missionaries to China. China’s loss to Britain in the Second Opium War (1856–1860) led to the signing of the Treaty of Tianjin, which gave Britain, France, the United States, and Russia further rights to trade and establish diplomatic posts in the capital of Beijing. China refused to honor the treaty, however, and British and French troops invaded Beijing in 1860, looting and burning the imperial Old Summer Palace (Figure 9.12). The subsequent Convention of Beijing affirmed the Treaty of Tianjin.

英国赢得了第一次鸦片战争（1839-1842），控制了香港和 五个港口：广州、上海、宁波、福州和厦门。 1844年，中国又与法国、美国签订条约，赋予其在五个开 岸进行贸易、在中国建立基督教教堂、派遣传教士的权利。中国在第二次鸦片战争（1856-1860）中输 英国，签订了《天津条约》 ，该条约赋予英国、法国、美国和俄罗斯进一步在首都北京进行贸易和建立 机构的权利。然而，中国拒绝遵守该条约，英法军队于 1860 年入侵北京，抢劫并焚烧了圆明园（图 9. ）。随后的北京会议确认了《天津条约》 。
