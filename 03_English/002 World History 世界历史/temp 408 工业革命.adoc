In 1899, the Boxers began their campaign to drive foreigners from China. Terrified foreigners streamed into Beijing seeking protection, but Cixi encouraged them to leave. Fearing for their lives, they barricaded themselves inside the embassies in the foreign quarter of Beijing. Cixi then proclaimed her allegiance to the Boxers and declared war on foreigners within China.

1899年，义和团开始了他们的驱逐外国人出中国的运动. 惊恐万状的外国人涌入北京寻求保护，但慈禧鼓励他们离开。由于担心自己的生命安全，他们把自己关在北京涉外区的使馆内。慈禧随后宣布效忠义和团，并向中国境内的外国人宣战。

Swiftly Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Japan, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Italy formed the Eight-Nation Alliance, and their troops raced to Beijing. After a siege of fifty-five days, the international force arrived and the Boxers were dispersed, killed, or captured. In September 1901, the Boxer Protocol was signed, officially ending the incident. China was forbidden to import weapons for two years, and foreign legations were given the right to keep troops of their own nation for their defense. China also awarded $330 million to the members of the Eight-Nation Alliance.

英、法、德、美、日、俄、奥匈、意等国迅速组成八国同盟，兵力奔赴北京。经过五十五天的围困后，国际部队抵达，义和团被驱散、杀害或俘虏。 1901年9月，《the Boxer Protocol 辛丑条约》签署，事件正式结束。中国被禁止在两年内进口武器，外国使馆有权保留本国军 队用于防卫。中国还向八国联盟成员提供了3.3亿美元的援助。

Politically: Repeated breach of pledges to give the natives a fair and reasonable share in the higher administration of their own country, which has much shaken confidence in the good faith of the British word. Political aspirations and the legitimate claim to have a reasonable voice in the legislation and the imposition and disbursement of taxes, met to a very slight degree, thus treating the natives of India not as British subjects, in whom representation is a birthright. Consequent on the above, an utter disregard of the feelings and views of the natives.

(印度对英国的看法: ) 政治上：一再违反让当地人在自己国家的高级管理中享有公平合理份额的承诺，这极大 地动摇了人们对英国话语诚信的信心。政治愿望和在立法以及征税和支付方面拥有合理 发言权的合法要求得到了非常轻微的满足，因此印度人不被视为英国臣民，而代表权是 英国人与生俱来的权利。综上所述，完全无视当地人的感受和观点。

The natives call the British system Sakar ki Churi, the knife of sugar. That is to say, there is no oppression, it is all smooth and sweet, but it is the knife, notwithstanding.

当地人将英国 的系统称为 Sakar ki Churi，即糖刀。也就是说，没有任何压迫感，一切都是顺滑而甜 蜜的，但尽管如此，那是刀。

The Second Industrial Revolution began in the second half of the nineteenth century and lasted until the start of World War I.

第二次工业革命始于十九世纪下半叶，一直持续到第一次世界大战开始

Before the nineteenth century, life changed little from one era to the next. Generations of people worked on farms. If they did not live on isolated farms, they inhabited small villages and usually did not venture far from the place where they were born. They raised enough food to feed themselves and sold any surplus in market towns, using their earnings to buy only the handcrafted goods they could not make for themselves. Beautiful works of art were sculpted or painted, music composed, and poems written, but before the Industrial Revolution, most ordinary people never saw, heard, or read them. All that changed in the nineteenth century, as new forms of technology and new sources of power transformed the way people in industrialized nations lived.

十九世纪之前，生活从一个时代到下一个时代几乎没有什么变化。一代又一代的人们在农场劳作. 人们通常不会冒险远离他们的出生地。他们种植了足够的食物来养活自己，并在 集镇上出售剩余的食物，用他们的收入只购买他们自己无法制作的手工艺品。在伦敦和巴黎等世界 上为数不多的大城市，有科学发现，但对大多数人口影响甚微。美丽的艺术作品被雕刻或绘画，创作 音乐，写诗，但在工业革命之前，大多数普通人从未见过、听到或读过它们。十九世纪(工业革命使人们传统的那种生活和工作方式, 彻底改变了)，随着新技术 和新能源改变了工业化国家人们的生活方式，一切都发生了变化。

Some of the most profound changes brought by industrialization were those that affected the workplace, bringing new challenges while also transforming the nature of labor.

工业化带来的一些最深刻的变化影响了工作场所，带来了新的挑战，同时也改变了劳动的性质。

Perhaps the greatest change was the development of a new source of energy—electricity. Water power had earlier replaced animal power, and steam engines fueled by burning coal had driven the machinery of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

With electric lights, the factory floor could be lit twenty-four hours a day, and workers could labor long into the night in all seasons.

也许最大的变化是新能源——电力的开发。水力较早地取代了畜力，以燃煤为燃料的蒸汽机驱动了十 八世纪末十九世纪初的机械。到十九世纪末，电力也取代了蒸汽。有了电灯，工厂车间就可以一天二十四小时都亮着，工人们可以在任何季节工作到深夜。

Assembly lines and the mechanization of each step of the manufacturing process meant that, for the most part, factory work was unskilled in nature. Laborers lived with the knowledge that they could be replaced at any moment. Some work, like the repairing of machines, was skilled. Most, though, performed repetitive tasks that anyone could master with a bit of instruction. The assembly line reduced employees’ sense of contribution to the finished process and rendered work boring and repetitive, almost transforming workers into machines themselves.

装配线和制造过程每个步骤的机械化意味着，在很大程度上，工厂工作本质上是非技术性的。工人们 知道，他们随时可能被替换。有些工作，比如修 理机器，是需要技术的。不过，大多数人执行的是重复性 任务，任何人都可以通过一些指导来掌握。装配线降低了员工对成品流程的贡献感，使工作变得枯燥 和重复，几乎将工人本身变成了机器。

Nineteenth-century workers commonly toiled ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week. In 1897 in Russia, reform laws reduced the workday from fourteen hours (and sometimes as many as eighteen) to only eleven and a half.

Luckily for the subjects of the tsar, the majority of Russian factory workers could look forward to nearly one hundred holidays per year. They would have been envied by Japan’s cotton spinners, teenaged women who often worked for seventeen-hour stretches punctuated only by short breaks.

十九世纪的工人通常每天工作十到十二个小时，每周工作六天。 1897 年，俄罗斯改革法将工作日从十 四小时（有时多达十八小时）减少到只有十一个半小时。对于沙皇的臣民来说幸运的是，大多数俄罗斯工厂工人每年可以期待近一百个假期。她们会受到日本棉纺工的羡慕，这些十几岁的女性经常连续工作十七个小时，中间只有短暂的休息。

Adult men were the most highly paid workers. Adult women earned about half as much, and children less than adults, often only a quarter of an adult male’s pay. Work was not always steady; workplaces sometimes shut down unexpectedly when raw materials or work orders fell short. This meant that low pay was often accompanied by periodic unemployment, for which workers had no safety net. Most governments did not provide unemployment insurance, and government-subsidized housing for the poor did not exist. When workers lost their jobs, they were forced to turn to religious institutions or private charities for money for food and rent.

成年男性是收入最高的工人。成年女性的收入约为成年男性的一半，儿童的收入则低于成人，通常只 有成年男性的四分之一。工作并不总是稳定的；当原材料或工单短缺时，工作场所有时会意外关闭。 这意味着低工资往往伴随着周期性失业，而工人没有安全网。大多数政府不提供失业保险，也不存在 为穷人提供的政府补贴住房。当工人失业时，他们被迫向宗教机构或私人慈善机构寻求食物和租金。

Between 1873 and the end of the century, periodic recessions and depressions alternated with boom periods, rocking economies around the world.

1873 年至本世纪 末，周期性的衰退和萧条与繁荣时期交替出现，震撼了世界各地的经济。

Factory owners faced a growing number of competitors. They responded by increasing the pace of work.

工厂主面临着越来越多的竞争对手。他们的回 应是加快工作节奏。

The pace and long hours of mechanized labor took a toll on workers’ health and safety. Injuries were common. Fingers and hands were often lost to moving machine parts. Constant standing resulted in back problems, swollen feet, and miscarriages. In textile factories, inhaled fibers caused breathing problems that left workers permanently disabled. The constant noise of machinery led to hearing loss. Summer temperatures combined with the heat generated by machinery and moving bodies left workers on the brink of heat exhaustion. Laborers in Japan’s silk industry were often scalded while boiling silkworm cocoons. Toxic chemicals used in largely unregulated production processes also played havoc with workers’ health and safety. In some places, workers, especially women, were beaten by their supervisors; young women sent to work in the Japanese cotton industry by their impoverished parents were often caned or whipped.

机械化劳动的速度和长时间对工人的健康和安全造成了损害。受伤很常见。手指和手经常因移动的机 器部件而失去作用。持续站立会导致背部问题、脚肿胀和流产。在纺织工厂，吸入纤维会导致呼吸问 题，导致工人永久残疾。持续不断的机械噪音导致听力损失。夏季气温加上机械和移动物体产生的热 量使工人们处于中暑的边缘。日本丝绸业的工人在煮蚕茧时经常被烫伤。在很大程度上不受监管的生 产过程中使用的有毒化学品也对工人的健康和安全造成严重破坏。在一些地方，工人，特别是妇女， 遭到主管的殴打；被贫穷的父母送到日本棉花行业工作的年轻女性经常遭到鞭打或鞭打。

Occupational Disease: Phosphorus Necrosis

职业病：磷坏死

This set of undated photographs depicts a Dutch woman whose lower jaw has been eaten away by phosphorus, a condition commonly known as “phossy jaw.” The use of phosphorus for match production in the Netherlands was banned in 1901.

这组未注明日期的照片描绘了一位荷兰妇女，她的下颌已被磷侵蚀，这种情况通常被称为“下颌磷”。荷兰于 1901 年禁止 在火柴生产中使用磷。

Living in a working-class quarter, coming in contact with laborers and their wives, I could not fail to hear tales of the dangers that workingmen faced, of cases of carbonmonoxide gassing in the great steel mills, of painters disabled by lead palsy, of pneumonia and rheumatism among the men in the stockyards. Illinois then had no legislation providing compensation for accident or disease caused by occupation. . .

生活在工人阶级居住区，与工人及其妻子接触，我不可能不听到关于工人所面临的危 险、大型钢铁厂中一氧化碳中毒事件、油漆工因铅麻痹而致残的故事。 ，畜牧场里的 男人患有肺炎和风湿病。伊利诺伊州当时没有立法为职业造成的事故或疾病提供赔偿。

Phossy jaw is a very distressing form of industrial disease. It comes from breathing the fumes of white or yellow phosphorus, which gives off fumes at room temperature, or from putting into the mouth food or gum or fingers smeared with phosphorus. Even drinking from a glass which has stood on the workbench is dangerous. The phosphorus penetrates into a defective tooth and down through the roots to the jawbone, killing the tissue cells which then become the prey of suppurative germs from the mouth, and abscesses form. The jaw swells and the pain is intense. . . . Sometimes the abscess forms in the upper jaw and works up into the orbit, causing the loss of an eye. In severe cases one lower jawbone may have to be removed, or an upper jawbone—perhaps both.

颌骨磷灰石是一种非常令人痛苦的工业病。它来自于呼吸白磷或黄磷的烟雾，这些烟雾 在室温下会释放出烟雾，或者来自于将涂有磷的食物、口香糖或手指放入口中。即使用 放在工作台上的玻璃杯喝水也是危险的。磷渗透到有缺陷的牙齿中，穿过牙根到达颌 骨，杀死组织细胞，然后这些组织细胞成为口腔中化脓细菌的猎物，并形成脓肿。下巴 肿胀并且疼痛剧烈。 。 。 。有时，脓肿形成于上颌，并蔓延至眼眶，导致失去一只眼 睛。在严重的情况下，可能需要切除一根下颌骨，或者一根上颌骨，或者两者都被切 除。

Despite low pay, long hours, and difficult conditions of factory work, many working-class people preferred it to other types of available labor. Jobs like driving wagons and unloading ships were also low-paying jobs but required working outside in all kinds of weather. Railroad workers were vulnerable to incapacitating injuries from being caught between railcars or falling under their wheels. Miners toiled in dark, cramped environments, where temperatures sometimes rose so high they had to work naked to keep from passing out. Cave-ins were a constant threat. Industrial labor, regardless of the type, was also more highly paid than agricultural labor.

尽管工厂工作工资低、工作时间长、条件艰苦，但与其他类型的可用劳动力相比，许多工人阶级更喜 欢它。驾驶货车和卸船等工作也是低薪工作，但需要在各种天气下在户外工作。铁路工人很容易因被 夹在火车车厢之间或跌倒在车轮下而受伤而丧失能力。矿工们在黑暗、狭窄的环境中辛勤劳作，有时 温度会升得很高，他们不得不赤身裸体工作，以免昏倒。塌方是一个持续存在的威胁。工业劳动力， 无论何种类型，其工资也高于农业劳动力。

Factory work was especially desirable to unmarried women, whose most common alternative was domestic service. Living in their employers’ homes, domestic workers were expected to be available at all times of the day and night, were constantly watched, and made very little money. On the factory floor, unmarried young women might be sexually harassed by male employers, supervisors, or coworkers.

工厂工作对未婚女性来说尤其有吸引力，她们最常见的选择是家政服务。住在雇主家中的家庭佣工被 要求全天候待命，经常受到监视，而且赚的钱很少。在工厂车间，未婚的年轻女性可能会受 到男性雇主、主管或同事的性骚扰。

Because women were paid less than men, unmarried women did not earn enough to live independently. They tended to live at home, where they were expected to give their wages to their parents and accept a small allowance in return. Even if they rented living quarters with other female workers and shared expenses, they might grant sexual favors to young men in exchange for meals or clothes, a form of casual prostitution known as “treating.” Nevertheless, many young female factory workers enjoyed relative independence before marriage, and the inexpensive entertainment found in industrial cities.

由于女性的工资低于男性，未婚女性的收入不足以独立生活。他们往往住在家里，将工资交给父母并 接受少量津贴作为回报。即使她们与其他女工合租住所并分摊费用，她们也可能向年轻男性提供性好 处，以换取食物或衣服，这是一种被称为“招待”的临时卖淫形式。尽管如此，许多年轻的工厂女工在婚 前享有相对独立，以及在工业城市找到的廉价娱乐活动。

Industrialization brought profound changes to countries like Britain, France, Germany, and the United States.

工业化给英、法、德、美等国带来了深刻变化。(科技改变生活方式，于是旧的生活传统就消失了，再也回不去，成了回忆)

Pasteur’s discoveries also led to the pasteurization of milk beginning in the 1860s, making it safer to drink by heating it to destroy pathogens. The development of the antiseptic method by Joseph Lister in the 1860s and the identification of human blood types in 1901, which made safe blood transfusions possible, transformed the practice of surgery.

巴斯德的发现还导致从 1860 年代开 始对牛奶进行巴氏灭菌，通过加热消灭病原体，使其饮用更安全。约瑟夫·李斯特 (Joseph Lister)在 1860 年代发明了消毒方法，并在 1901 年对人类血型进行了鉴定，使安全输血成为可能，从而改变了 手术实践。

Between 1876 and 1901, life expectancy for a German man rose from thirty-four to forty-five years. A German woman born in 1876 could expect to live until she was thirty-seven years old; the average German woman born in 1901 lived to be forty-eight years old.

1876 年至 1901 年间，德国男性的预期寿命从 34 岁 增加到 45 岁。 1876 年出生的德国女性预计可以活到 37 岁； 1901 年出生的德国女性平均寿命为 48 岁。

As people moved from small farms and country villages to cities and factory towns, their lives changed in ways both small and profound. On farms and in artisans’ workshops, women and children had labored alongside husbands and fathers and contributed to the family’s income. They did not always have similar opportunities in the industrial city.

当人们从小农场和乡村迁移到城市和工厂城镇时，他们的生活发生了微小而深刻的变化。在农场和工 匠作坊里，妇女和儿童与丈夫和父亲一起劳动，为家庭收入做出了贡献。他们在工业城市并不总是有 类似的机会。(不得不进入另一种模式轨道中，而不管你喜不喜欢)

Early in the Industrial Revolution, women and children worked in factories, but by the end of the nineteenth century, this situation had changed. Although increasing mechanization meant that workers needed less physical strength, the presence of women and children in the workplace declined.

工业革命初期，妇女和儿童在工厂工作，但到了十九世纪末，这种情况发生了变化。尽管机械化程度 的提高意味着工人需要的体力减少，但工作场所中妇女和儿童的数量却有所减少。

Indeed, many male laborers blamed women’s willingness to accept low wages for keeping their own pay low, and they sought to push women out of the workplace. In the United States and western Europe, children also had largely ceased working in most factories by the beginning of the twentieth century. Greater mechanization of the workplace eliminated the jobs that children had once been employed to do. Increasingly, too, governments passed laws that attempted to ban child labor.

事实上，许多男性劳动者指责女性愿意接受低工资，导致自己的工资保持在较低水平，并试图将女性 赶出工作场所。在美国和西欧，到二十世纪初，大多数工厂里的儿童也基本上停止了工作。工作场所 机械化程度的提高消除了曾经雇用儿童从事的工作。各国政府也越来越多地通过了试图禁止童工的法 律。 Britain, the first nation to industrialize, led the way in eliminating child labor.

英国作为第一个工业化国家，在消除童工方面处于领先地位。

In the face of such opposition to limits on it, child labor continued until laws requiring compulsory education helped to move children from factories to schoolrooms. By the end of the nineteenth century, new laws in the United States and western and central Europe mandated schooling, largely eliminating formal wage work by children under the age of fourteen.

面对对限制童工的反对，童工现象仍在继续，直到义务教育法律帮助儿童从工厂转移到学校为止。到 十九世纪末，美国以及西欧和中欧的新法律强制要求接受教育，很大程度上消除了十四岁以下儿童的 正式工资工作。

by the beginning of the twentieth century in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany, working-class wives tended to supplement the family’s income by working at home, not outside it. Unmarried women and those whose husbands were disabled or absent still sought factory work, but married women more commonly earned money in ways that did not require them to leave the home. Some cared for the children of working neighbors and took in laundry. If the family’s living space were large enough, they might take in boarders. Many women did piecework at home, compensated based on the number of items produced. They collected materials from local businesses and assembled small items like toys, costume jewelry, or artificial flowers. Some stitched together items of clothing. They were often joined by their children, who might also hawk newspapers and peddle wares on the street.

到了二十世纪初，在美国、法国、英国和德国，工人阶级的妻子倾向于在家工作 而不是外出工作来补充家庭收入。未婚妇女和丈夫残疾或不在身边的妇女仍然寻求工厂工作，但已婚 妇女更常见的是通过不需要离开家的方式赚钱。有些人照顾工作邻居的孩子并洗衣服. 。如果家里的居 住空间足够大，他们可能会收住寄宿生. 许多妇女在家做计件工作，根据生产的物品数量获得报酬。他们从当地企业收 集材料并组装玩具、人造珠宝或人造花等小物品。有些人把衣服缝在一起。他们的孩子经常加入他们 的行列，孩子们也可能在街上兜售报纸和兜售商品.

By the beginning of the nineteenth century middle-class families had reduced the number of children they had. By the second half of the century, however, children could no longer earn their keep alongside their parents in the factory and instead had to be fed and clothed during their school years from a smaller pool of money. They then became an expense many working-class families could not afford. The inadequate and overcrowded urban housing available to the industrial working class also made large families undesirable.

到十九世纪初，中产阶级家庭已 经减少了孩子的数量。到了本世纪下半叶，孩子们再也无法与父母一起在工厂谋生，而在上学期间只能靠更 少的钱来维持衣食。然后，它们就成为许多工薪阶层家庭无法承受的开支。工业工人阶级可获得的城 市住房不足且过度拥挤，这也使得大家庭变得不受欢迎。.

Beginning in the 1870s, working-class families began to shrink in size, and by the start of the twentieth century, the average family size for laborers had dropped from four to six children to two to four, only slightly larger than among the middle class.

从1870年代开 始，工人阶级家庭规模开始缩小，到了20世纪初，工人的平均家庭规模从4至6个孩子减少到2至4个， 仅略高于中产阶级。

City air was also dirty in the late nineteenth century. Coal was burned to generate both steam power and electricity, and coal smoke plagued industrial cities as they grew in size.

十九世纪末，城市空气也很脏。燃烧煤炭来产生蒸汽动力和电力，随着工业城市规模的扩大，煤烟一 直困扰着它们。

Respiratory problems caused by the inhalation of coal smoke affected many in the nineteenth century. Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma were common. Approximately one-third of child deaths in nineteenth-century England were attributed to respiratory ailments.

十九世纪，许多人因吸入煤烟而引起呼吸系统疾病。肺气 肿、慢性支气管炎和哮喘很常见。十九世纪英国大约三分之一的儿童死亡归因于呼吸系统疾病。

Prostitution, both formal and informal, was common in nineteenth-century cities. Some prostitutes were professionals who lived in brothels, but many others were simply young single women who could not survive on their meager wages alone. Sexually transmitted diseases were rampant, however. Many prostitutes and their clients suffered from syphilis, and married men sometimes infected their wives. The result was infertility or babies who were stillborn or blind or had mental disabilities. With no effective cure, syphilis killed its victims after years of agony.

正式和非正式的卖淫在十九世纪的城市中都很常见。有些妓女是住在妓院的专业人士，但其他许多妓 女只是年轻的单身女性，仅靠微薄的工资无法生存。然而，性传播疾病却十分猖獗。许多妓女及其嫖客都患有梅毒， 已婚男子有时也会传染给他们的妻子。结果是不孕、婴儿死产、失明或患有精神障碍。由于没有有效 的治疗方法，梅毒在多年的痛苦后杀死了受害者。
