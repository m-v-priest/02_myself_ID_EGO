Great Britain was the first nation to enter the Industrial Revolution, beginning to mechanize the production of goods in the eighteenth century. It was followed by the United States, France, Belgium, and, in the first half of the nineteenth century, by Germany. These nations harnessed the power first of water and then of steam and began the mass production of goods such as textiles, iron, and steel. Perhaps most significantly, they also manufactured machines that produced parts for other machines.

英国是第一个进入工业革命的国家，在十八世纪开始实现商品生产机械化。紧随其后的是美国、法国、
时，以及十九世纪上半叶的德国。这些国家首先利用水力，然后利用蒸汽力，开始大规模生产纺织品、
等商品。也许最重要的是，他们还制造了为其他机器生产零件的机器.



Between the middle of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, these nations embarked on a new phase of industrialization. European and U.S. industry was transformed again by new sources of power, technological innovations, new forms of transportation, and growing communications networks. This process is often called the Second Industrial Revolution. At the same time, industrialization began outside the United States and western and central Europe, especially in Russia and Japan.

十九世纪中叶至二十世纪初，这些国家进入了工业化的新阶段。新的能源、技术创新、新的交通方式和
发展的通信网络再次改变了欧洲和美国的工业。这个过程通常被称为第二次工业革命。与此同时，工业
美国以外以及西欧和中欧开始，特别是在俄罗斯和日本。


The automobile industry also increased the demand for rubber and petroleum, which most industrialized nations needed to import.

汽车
还增加了对橡胶和石油的需求，而大多数工业化国家都需要进口。

The automobile’s arrival depended on another crucial invention—the internal combustion engine. Internal combustion engines powered automobiles as well as machinery in small workshops, offering an alternative where steam engines, which were large, could not easily fit.

汽车的出现取决于另一项重要的发明——内燃机。内燃机为汽车和小型车间的机械提供动力，为大型蒸汽机无法轻易安装的地方提供
代方案。


Electricity ran machines in factories and lit streets, workplaces, and homes following the invention of the incandescent light bulb, by Joseph Swan in Britain in 1878 and Thomas Edison in the United States in 1879.

继 1878 年英国的约瑟夫·斯旺 (Joseph Swan)和美国的托马斯·爱迪生 (Thomas Edison)于 1879 年发明白
泡后，电力为工厂的机器提供了动力，为街道、工作场所和家庭提供了照明。

Until the mid-nineteenth century, industrialization had taken place only in Britain, the United States,
France, Germany, and Belgium. By the middle of the century, other countries like Canada, Italy, and
Russia had also begun to industrialize.

直到十九世纪中叶，只有英国、美国、法国、德国和比利时实现了工业化。到本世纪中叶，加拿大、意
和俄罗斯等其他国家也开始工业化。

Italy industrialized after other western and central European nations such as France and Germany. Th
fragmented political system of the Italian peninsula before its unification as a single nation (which be
in 1861) delayed general industrial development.

意大利的工业化程度仅次于法国和德国等其他西欧和中欧国家。意大利半岛在统一为一个国家（始于 18
年）之前，其政治体系支离破碎，阻碍了总体工业发展。

Russia had begun industrializing in the early nineteenth century.

十九世纪初，俄罗斯开始工业化

Russia remained relatively unindustrialized compared to the United States and much of western and central Europe.

与美国以及西欧和中欧大部分国家相比，俄罗斯的工业化程度仍然相对较低。


Russia lacked many advantages for industrializing that other countries possessed. It did not have many artisans. Russia’s population also consisted of many serfs who, unlike American and British farmers, were bound to the land and could not seek opportunities elsewhere such as in factories.


俄罗斯缺乏其他国家所拥有的许多工业化优势。它没有很多工匠. 与美国和英国的农民不同，俄罗斯的人口中也有许多农奴，他们被束缚在土地上，不能在工厂等其他地方寻找机会。

Following its defeat in the Crimean War, Russia increased its efforts to industrialize. In 1861, it abolished serfdom, providing potential workers for factories.  However, Russia’s late start meant it did not reach the same level of industrialization as western and central Europe and the United States until the twentieth century.

克里米亚战争失败后，俄罗斯加大了工业化力度。 1861年，它废除了农奴制，为工厂提供了潜在的工人. 然而，俄罗斯起步
晚，直到20世纪才达到与西欧、中欧和美国同等的工业化水平。



As the United States and European nations industrialized, African, Latin American, and Asian nations, with the exception of Japan, did not.  Historians disagree about the reasons for this Great Divergence.

Countries such as Egypt and the Latin American nations realized their strengths lay better in producing raw materials for the industrializing nations than pursuing widespread industrialization. In each nation, a unique set of circumstances influenced the path taken.

当美国和欧洲国家实现工业化时，非洲、拉丁美洲和亚洲国家（日本除外）却没有实现工业化。历史学家对于这次大分流的原因存在分歧。埃及和拉丁美洲国家等国家意识到自己的优势在于为工业化国家生产原材料, 而不是追求广泛的工业化。

India’s industrial endeavors were greatly affected by its relationship with Britain, which had begun trading in India in the 1600s. The Seven Years’ War and the subsequent Treaty of Paris, signed in 1763, effectively brought French power in India to an end.

印度的工业发展深受其与英国关系的影响，英国在 1600 年代就开始与印度进行贸易。七年战争和随后于
1763 年签署的《巴黎条约》实际上结束了法国在印度的势力，


Britain, however, had no intention of allowing its colony to become its economic rival. Like all colonies, India was meant to enrich Britain, not compete with it. Thus began a process often referred to as deindustrialization, a reduction in a nation’s or region’s industrial activity.

然而，英国无意让其殖民地成为其经济竞争对手。和所有殖民地一样，印度的目的是让英国富裕起来，
是与之竞争。由此开始了一个通常被称为去工业化的过程，即一个国家或地区工业活动的减少。(用政策来抑制一个国家的产业升级)


China also did not become an industrial power in the nineteenth century. Historians have offered a variety of reasons.

First, no challengers in East Asia could match China in size, wealth, and military strength, so it had no need to compete with anyone. Second, because China’s population was large and often poor, labor was abundant and employers did not have to offer high wages to attract employees or replace workers with labor-saving machinery.

中国在十九世纪也没有成为工业强国。
学家提出了各种各样的理由。
首先，东亚的挑战者在规模、财富和军事实力上都无法与中国相比，因此没有必要与任何人竞争。其次
于中国人口众多且往往贫困，劳动力充足，雇主不必提供高工资来吸引员工或用节省劳动力的机器取代
人。


industrial development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had many consequences, short and long term. To generate profits for themselves and their investors, businesses needed to operate inexpensively and sell as many goods as possible. To keep costs and therefore prices low, they sought inexpensive raw materials. They also wanted markets in which to sell their finished goods, preferably without competing with others. The ships that transported raw materials and finished products required ports where they could refuel and resupply, as did the navies that kept them safe.

为了为自己和投资者创造利润，企业需要以低廉的成本运营并销售尽可能多的商品。为了降低成
本并降低价格，他们寻求廉价的原材料。他们还希望有市场来销售他们的制成品，最好不要与其他人
竞争。运输原材料和成品的船只需要港口来补充燃料和补给，保障船只安全的海军也需要港口。(生意的输入端（原材料）和输出端（消费者），都需要成本最小化，利益最大化)


To the industrial powers, these needs justified their practice of imperialism, that is, the policy of gaining direct or indirect control over parts of the world with low-cost resources and no competing mass-produced goods.  The industrialized nations came to dominate states in Africa, Asia, and
the Pacific, taking natural resources and money from them.

对于工业强国来说，这些需要证明了他们的帝国主义做法是合理的，即利用低成本资源和没有竞争性
大批量生产的商品来直接或间接控制世界部分地区的政策。工业化国家开始主宰非洲、亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，从它们那里夺取自然资源和
金钱

The industrializing powers could satisfy their needs for raw materials and markets only by reaching
outside their borders to places in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean. To amass large profits,
however, they needed to extract raw materials at such low prices that it was unlikely Africans,
Asians, and Pacific Islanders would consent to them. In addition, and also unlikely, these nations
would have to agree to purchase manufactured goods from their industrialized partners even though
they might be able to produce such things for themselves. Business owners and politicians in
industrialized nations thus believed they needed to gain control over these distant countries and rule
them as part of an empire. Quite often, military conquest was the means by which they did so. Once
these foreign territories were secured, markets established, and funds invested, the imperial powers
then needed to prevent encroachment on their possessions by other industrial powers. This led to
them to exercise even greater control over their colonies and often to attempt to conquer
neighboring regions. Great Britain, for example, competed with Russia for control of Afghanistan
largely to limit Russian access to Britain’s prize colony of India.

工业化强国只有走出国门，进入非洲、亚洲和太平洋地区，才能满足对原材料和市场的需求。然而，
为了积累巨额利润，他们需要以极低的价格开采原材料，以至于非洲、亚洲和太平洋岛民不太可能同
意他们的做法。此外，也是不太可能的，这些国家必须同意从其工业化伙伴那里购买制成品，即使它
们可能能够为自己生产此类产品。因此，工业化国家的企业主和政治家认为，他们需要控制这些遥远
的国家，并将它们作为帝国的一部分进行统治。很多时候，军事征服是他们这样做的手段。一旦这些
外国领土获得安全、市场建立、资金投入，帝国列强就需要防止其他工业强国对其财产的侵犯。这导
致他们对殖民地实行更大的控制，并经常试图征服邻近地区。例如，英国与俄罗斯争夺对阿富汗的控
制权，主要是为了限制俄罗斯进入英国的殖民地印度。


The new colonies were quite different from those that European powers had established in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was not generally expected that large numbers of Europeans
would relocate to Africa or Asia and make permanent homes there, and the colonies were not
intended to have quite the same relationship to the home country that earlier “settler colonies” had
had. The U.S. treatment of the Philippines and Filipinos was fundamentally different from what North
American colonists had experienced from Great Britain, for example. The industrial nations intended
to exploit the resources and people of the colonies they established, not settle them.

这些新殖民地与欧洲列强在十六、十七世纪建立的殖民地有很大不同。人们普遍预计，大量欧洲人不
会迁移到非洲或亚洲并在那里永久定居，殖民地也无意与母国建立与早期“定居者殖民地”完全相同的关
系。例如，美国对待菲律宾和菲律宾人的方式与北美殖民者在英国所经历的方式根本不同。工业国家
的目的是开发他们所建立的殖民地的资源和人民，而不是定居在那里。(更加功利化，工具化殖民地)


There were some exceptions. The North African colony of Algeria, which France had taken control of
in 1830, was incorporated as part of France in 1848. Many French people and other Europeans
immigrated to the coastal regions of Algeria and Tunisia with government encouragement in the
nineteenth century. Many Europeans also settled in the British and Dutch colonies in southern
Africa. However, this was not the imperial norm.

但也有一些例外。法国于 1830 年控制的北非殖民地阿尔及利亚，于 1848 年并入法国的一部分。十九
世纪，在政府的鼓励下，许多法国人和其他欧洲人移民到阿尔及利亚和突尼斯沿海地区。许多欧洲人
还定居在南部非洲的英国和荷兰殖民地。然而，这并不是帝国的常态。

Malaria was also a significant problem in Britain’s colony of India. It was exacerbated by schemes to
dig irrigation canals and clear land for railroads, creating more areas for water to collect in breeding
grounds for the mosquitoes that carried the disease. Quinine, which comes from the bark of the
cinchona tree, had been used to treat malaria for years, and in the 1840s the British discovered that
taking it before exposure could prevent people from ever contracting the disease. Cinchona trees
grew only in the Andes, however, and there were not enough to meet the European demand.
Attempts to plant cinchona trees elsewhere often failed, but by the 1870s the Dutch were
successfully growing them in their colony of Indonesia and producing additional quinine.


疟疾也是英国殖民地印度的一个严重问题。挖掘灌溉渠和清理土地修建铁路的计划加剧了这种情况，
为携带这种疾病的蚊子的繁殖地创造了更多的积水区域。奎宁来自金鸡纳树的树皮，多年来一直被用
来治疗疟疾，1840 年代英国人发现在接触疟疾之前服用奎宁可以防止人们感染这种疾病。然而，金鸡
纳树只生长在安第斯山脉，不足以满足欧洲的需求。在其他地方种植金鸡纳树的尝试常常失败，但到
了 1870 年代，荷兰人在印度尼西亚殖民地成功种植了金鸡纳树，并生产了更多的奎宁

Besides disease, difficult terrain and dense brush also made European exploratory and military
missions difficult. Following rivers inland was the easiest means of travel. However, most rivers were
too shallow for sailing ships.

除了疾病之外，崎岖的地形和茂密的灌木丛也给欧洲的探索和军事任务带来了困难。沿着内陆河流行
驶是最简单的旅行方式。然而，大多数河流水位太浅，无法航行


In the later nineteenth century, the industrialized nations regarded their colonies as necessary
sources of wealth and strength. Some, like Britain and France, had already established colonies a
century or more before. Now they focused on tightening their control over these and acquiring more.
The United States, Germany, and Japan lacked overseas colonies and now sought to acquire them.

十九世纪后期，工业化国家将其殖民地视为财富和力量的必要来源。英国和法国等一些国家在一个世
纪或更早之前就已经建立了殖民地。现在他们专注于加强对这些的控制并获取更多。美国、德国和日
本缺乏海外殖民地，现在正寻求获得它们。


Africa 非洲


At the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution, Europeans
controlled about 10 percent of the African continent. By the end of the century, they
controlled 90 percent, with the largest portions ruled by Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany.
Portugal and Spain still claimed colonies acquired in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

The “Scramble for Africa” reached its height during the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885
when, without input from Africans, European nations simply allotted different parts of the continent
to one another. Some agreements were formal recognitions of existing colonies and territories, while
others recognized new claims. Colonization continued throughout the 1880s–1910s.

“争夺非洲”在1884 年至 1885 年柏林会议期间达到顶峰，当时欧洲国家在
没有非洲人参与的情况下，简单地将非洲大陆的不同部分分配给彼此。一些协议是对现有殖民地和领
土的正式承认，而另一些协议则承认新的主张。殖民化在 1880 年代至 1910 年代持续进行。

France 法国

France had been reluctant to claim colonies in Africa. It controlled the island of Gorée off the coast
of Senegal and had a few trading posts in the interior. Beyond expanding into the interior of Senegal
in the 1850s, however, it did little until the end of the nineteenth century, when the European powers
met at the 1878 Congress of Berlin to decide the fate of the defeated Ottoman Empire’s possessions
in North Africa. France received Tunisia.

法国一直不愿在非洲宣称拥有殖民地。它控制着塞内加尔海岸附近的戈雷岛，并在内陆拥有一些贸易
站。然而，除了在 1850 年代向塞内加尔内陆扩张之外，它几乎没有采取任何行动，直到 19 世纪末，
欧洲列强在1878 年柏林会议上召开会议，决定战败的奥斯曼帝国在北非领地的命运。法国接收了突尼
斯。


Tunisia had borrowed heavily from European powers to fund development and modernize its army.
When it declared bankruptcy in 1869, Britain, France, and Italy established a commission to manage
its finances and ensure repayment. At the Congress of Berlin, Italy hoped to gain Tunisia since a
number of its citizens now lived there. Britain, however, did not wish Italy to control both sides of the
Strait of Sicily, endangering British access to the eastern Mediterranean, but it did want French
support for its claims to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Germany wished France to focus on
North Africa rather than continental Europe, where Germany hoped to increase its own influence.
Thus, France was given Tunisia, and Italy received the city of Tripoli in Libya instead.

突尼斯从欧洲大国借了大量资金来资助其军队的发展和现代化。 1869年该公司宣布破产后，英国、法
国和意大利成立了一个委员会来管理其财务并确保还款。在柏林会议上，意大利希望获得突尼斯，因
为现在有一些突尼斯公民居住在那里。然而，英国不希望意大利控制西西里海峡两岸，从而危及英国
进入东地中海的通道，但它确实希望法国支持其对地中海塞浦路斯岛的主权主张。德国希望法国将重
点放在北非而不是欧洲大陆，德国希望在欧洲大陆增加自己的影响力。因此，法国获得了突尼斯，而
意大利则获得了利比亚的黎波里市。


From 1880 to 1900 many parts of West Africa came
under French cont.

从 1880 年到
1900 年，西非的许多地区都处于法国的控制之下




Great Britain 大不列颠

South Africa was Britain’s first toehold on the continent. In 1806, Britain took formal control over the
Dutch Cape Colony, established by Dutch traders in the seventeenth century.

南非是英国在非洲大陆的第一个立足点。 1806 年，英国正式控制了 17 世纪荷兰商人建立的荷兰开普
殖民地。


Britain’s second area of interest in Africa was Egypt, an excellent source of cotton for its textile mills.
The possibility of building a canal across the Isthmus of Suez, which divided Asia from Africa, had
intrigued Europeans since the fifteenth century. Linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas would
allow ships to reach the Indian and Pacific Oceans without sailing around the tip of Africa, greatly
easing trade with South and East Asia. Construction began in 1859, and
the Suez Canal opened to shipping in 1869.

英国在非洲感兴趣的第二个领域是埃及，该国纺织厂的棉花资源极好。自十五世纪以来，在将亚洲与
非洲分开的苏伊士地峡修建一条运河的可能性一直引起欧洲人的兴趣。连接地中海和红海将使船只无
需绕行非洲一角即可到达印度洋和太平洋，从而大大简化与南亚和东亚的贸易。1859年开始修建，1869年苏伊士运河通航.




Britain had initially opposed the canal. It threatened British domination over the main water route to
Asia, which passed the British Cape Colony, and it made its prized colony of India more accessible
—and more vulnerable. Britain’s attitude changed, however, when Ismail Pasha, who became
khedive or viceroy of Egypt and Sudan following the death of his uncle Sa’id Pasha in 1863, found
himself deeply in debt to European creditors, which made it possible for European interests to
manipulate him. For example, he was forced to establish a dual court system in which accused
Europeans were tried by European judges, not Egyptian ones. In 1875, unable to pay his debts,
Ismail Pasha sold Egypt’s shares in the Suez Canal to Britain. He was also forced to allow British
and French officials to manage Egypt’s financial affairs.


英国最初反对修建运河。它威胁到英国对通往亚洲的主要水路的统治，这条水路经过英属开普殖民地，它使英国珍贵的殖民地印度更容易接近，也更容易受到攻击。然而，当伊斯梅尔帕夏(Ismail Pasha)成为埃及和苏丹的总督时，英国的态度发生了变化，他发现自己深陷欧洲债权人的债务，这使得欧洲利益集团有可能操纵他。例如，他被迫建立了一个双重法庭系统，被指控的欧洲人由欧洲法官审判，而不是埃及法官。1875年，由于无力偿还债务，伊斯梅尔帕夏将埃及在苏伊士运河的股份卖给了英国。他还被迫允许英国和法国官员管理埃及的金融事务。


Germany 德国
Germany came late to the scramble for colonies, delayed by a number of factors. Until 1871, it
consisted of a variety of German-speaking states and kingdoms in northern and central Europe,
none wealthy or powerful enough to establish colonies. Once unified as a country in 1871, it still did
not possess the ocean-going navy needed to trade with and defend colonies, and its first chancellor,
Otto von Bismarck, in office from 1871 until 1890, initially had no interest in an overseas empire. But by the 1880s he had changed his mind.  In Africa, Germany staked its claim to regions scattered across the
continent that had not already been colonized by France and England.




由于多种因素的影响，德国在争夺殖民地方面姗姗来迟。 1871 年之前，它由北欧和中欧的多个德语国
家和王国组成，但没有一个富裕或强大到足以建立殖民地。 1871年统一为一个国家后，它仍然不具备
与殖民地进行贸易和保卫殖民地所需的远洋海军，而且其第一任总理奥托·冯·俾斯麦（1871年至1890
年在位）最初对海外帝国没有兴趣。但到了 1880 年代，他改变了主意。在非洲，德国对分散在非洲大陆上尚未被法国和英国殖民的地区提出了主权
要求.


Italy 意大利

Italy was the last European power to establish colonies in Africa. In 1884, an Italian shipping
company bought Assab Bay, a port city on the Red Sea, from a local sultan. In 1886, Italy took
control of the Egyptian Red Sea port of Massawa at Britain’s urging to prevent France from acquiring
more territory in the region.

意大利是最后一个在非洲建立殖民地的欧洲强国。 1884年，一家意大利航运公司从当地苏丹手中购买
了红海港口城市阿萨布湾。 1886年，在英国的敦促下，意大利控制了埃及红海港口马萨瓦，以阻止法
国在该地区获得更多领土。

Italy grasped the parts of Africa that lay
unclaimed by other European powers.

意大利占领了其他欧洲列强无人认领的非洲部分地
区。






Despite Britain’s expansion into Africa, India remained its most important overseas territory. India
had been a possession of the British East India Company, which directly ruled approximately half of
India. In 1857, however, Muslim and Hindu soldiers in the company’s employ, known as sepoys, rose
in revolt. In 1858, following the British army’s suppression of the revolt, Parliament disbanded the
British East India Company and took control of the territory it had ruled. Local rulers whose authority
the East India Company acknowledged and who had remained loyal were left in nominal control of
their kingdoms, but in reality, they became subservient to Britain. Queen Victoria was officially
proclaimed empress of India in 1876, and the last Mughal emperor, who had not been active in the
revolt, was sent into exile. This transfer of power began the period of direct British rule called the
British Raj.

尽管英国向非洲扩张，印度仍然是其最重要的海外领土。印度曾是英国东印度公司的属地，该公司直
接统治着大约一半的印度。然而，1857 年，该公司雇佣的穆斯林和印度教士兵（称为“土兵” ）发动叛
乱。 1858年，英国军队镇压叛乱后，议会解散了英国东印度公司，并控制了其统治的领土。东印度公
司承认其权威并保持忠诚的当地统治者名义上控制着自己的王国，但实际上，他们屈服于英国。 1876
年，维多利亚女王被正式封为印度女皇，而未积极参与叛乱的莫卧儿末代皇帝则被流放。这次权力转
移开始了英国直接统治的时期，称为“英属统治” 。


British attempts to gain control over regions of Asia beyond India and Hong Kong were often
frustrated by Russia, which also sought to expand its influence there. The ongoing struggle between
the two was called The Great Game. From the 1850s through the 1870s, Russia gained control of
kingdoms occupied by Turkic-speaking peoples in central Asia and incorporated them into its
empire as a region called Turkestan. Britain feared Russia would try
to absorb India as well. To protect its prized possession, Britain sought to use the Emirate of
Afghanistan as a buffer zone. When Russia gained control of much of what is now Turkmenistan in 1881,
the two European nations jointly established the boundary line between an independent Afghanistan
and Russian territory, ending a serious conflict between the two powers.


英国试图控制印度和香港以外的亚洲地区的努力常常遭到俄罗斯的挫败，俄罗斯也试图扩大其在该地
区的影响力。两人之间持续不断的斗争被称为“伟大的博弈” 。从 1850 年代到 1870 年代，俄罗斯控制
了中亚突厥语民族占领的王国，并将其纳入其帝国，称为突厥斯坦地区. 英国担心俄罗斯也会试图吞并印度。为了保
护其珍贵的财产，英国寻求利用阿富汗酋长国作为缓冲区。1881年，当俄罗斯控制
了现在的土库曼斯坦的大部分地区时，这两个欧洲国家共同划定了独立的阿富汗和俄罗斯领土之间的
边界线，结束了两国之间的严重冲突。

Lacking many of the raw
materials necessary for industrialization, Japan, like other industrialized nations, began to seek them
abroad. It first took control of the Ryukyu Islands and also claimed the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin
Island. Russia, however, also laid claim to these territories, and for a while the two
nations shared Sakhalin Island. In 1875, Japan relinquished its claims to the island in exchange for
complete control over the Kurile Islands.

由于缺乏工业化所需的许多原材料，日本像其他工业化国家一样，开始
向国外寻求原材料。它首先控制了琉球群岛，并声称对千岛群岛和库页岛拥有主权。然
而，俄罗斯也声称对这些领土拥有主权，两国一度共享库页岛。 1875年，日本放弃对该岛的主权要
求，以换取对千岛群岛的完全控制。

Japan’s Empire. Unlike many European nations, Japan sought colonies closer to home, including the Ryukyu, Kurile, and
Sakhalin Islands.

日本帝国。与许多欧洲国家不同，日本寻求离本土更近的殖民地，包括琉球群岛、千岛群岛和萨哈林群岛。

Japan’s most desired prize was Korea. In 1873,  Korea’s King Gojong began to consider opening
the nation to the outside world. Anxious to gain an advantage, in 1876 Japan sent a gunboat to force
Korea to sign the Japan-Korea Treaty of Amity (Ganghwa Treaty) before it could make commercial
treaties with other nations. Among other provisions, the treaty allowed the Japanese to establish
trading ports in addition to the one to which they already had access. It also let Japanese merchants
live and work in Korea while subject only to Japanese law. In addition, Korea was declared to no
longer be a tributary state of China.

日本最想要的战利品是朝鲜. 1873 年，韩国高宗国王开始考虑对外开放。由于急于获得优势，日本于 1876 年派
出一艘炮舰迫使韩国签署《日韩友好条约》 （《江华条约》），然后才可以与其他国家签订商业条
约。除其他条款外，该条约还允许日本在已有的贸易港口之外建立贸易港口。它还允许日本商人在韩
国生活和工作，但仅受日本法律的约束。此外，朝鲜宣布不再是中国的附属国


China did not wish to relinquish its control so easily, and a series of uprisings and mutinies in Korea
in the 1880s gave it the opportunity to reassert its authority. In 1885, however, both Japan and China
agreed to withdraw military forces from the peninsula in 1885. Although this temporarily prevented
armed conflict between Japan and China, hostilities between the two soon commenced. In 1894,
the pro-Japanese Korean leader Kim Ok-Kyun was murdered in Shanghai, and an outraged Japan
awaited an opportunity to confront the Chinese. That same year, the Donghak Rebellion swept
Korea as disgruntled peasants demanded social reforms, giving China an excuse to dispatch a
military force to Korea in violation of its agreement with Japan. Japan in turn sent troops to confront
the Chinese, and the First Sino-Japanese War began.

中国不想轻易放弃控制权，1880年代朝鲜发生的一系列起义和兵变给了它重新确立权威的机会。然
而，日本和中国在1885年同意从半岛撤军。虽然这暂时阻止了日本和中国之间的武装冲突，但两国之
间的敌对行动很快就开始了。 1894年，亲日的韩国领导人金玉均在上海被谋杀，愤怒的日本等待着与
中国对抗的机会。同年，东学起义席卷韩国，不满的农民要求社会改革，这给中国提供了借口，违反
与日本的协议向朝鲜派遣军队。日本随后出兵与中国对抗，甲午战争爆发。

Humiliated, China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which
recognized Korea’s independence and conceded to Japan territory on the Liaodong Peninsula in
Manchuria as well as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Japan had now acquired an empire. Japan
quickly realized, however, that it would have to defend its gains from its old rival Russia. In 1896,
Koreans, angered by the assassination of their pro-Chinese queen by Japanese agents, overthrew
the pro-Japanese government then in power. As Japanese influence waned, Russian influence grew.

屈辱的中国于
1895年签署了《马关条约》 ，承认朝鲜独立，并将满洲辽东半岛、台湾和澎湖列岛的领土割让给日
本。日本现在已经获得了一个帝国。然而，日本很快意识到，它必须捍卫其从老对手俄罗斯手中获得
的利益。 1896年，韩国人对日本特工刺杀亲中国女王感到愤怒，推翻了当时掌权的亲日政府。随着日
本影响力的减弱，俄罗斯影响力的增强.


Russia also began to encroach upon Japanese territory in Manchuria. Russia’s one Pacific port,
Vladivostok, was often frozen over. Seeking a harbor that was ice-free year-round, Russia leased
land from China on the Liaodong Peninsula in 1897 and built a new port, Port Arthur. A wary Japan
offered Russia free rein on the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for Japan’s retaining control over
Korea. When Russia refused to compromise, Japan attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur in the
winter of 1904, beginning the Russo-Japanese War. Once again, Japan emerged victorious over a
much larger nation. The Treaty of Portsmouth, signed in September 1905, acknowledged Japan’s
right to Korea and awarded Japan control of southern Manchuria. Japan formally annexed Korea in
1910.

俄罗斯也开始侵占日本在满洲的领土。俄罗斯的太平洋港口之一符拉迪沃斯托克经常被冰冻。为了寻
求一个常年不冻的港口，俄罗斯于1897年从中国租用了辽东半岛的土地，建造了一个新的港口——旅
顺港。警惕的日本向俄罗斯提供了对辽东半岛的自由支配权，以换取日本保留对朝鲜的控制。当俄罗
斯拒绝妥协时，日本于 1904 年冬天袭击了旅顺港的俄罗斯舰队，日俄战争爆发。日本再次战胜了一个
更大的国家。 1905 年 9 月签署的《朴茨茅斯条约》承认日本对朝鲜的权利，并授予日本对满洲南部的
控制权。日本于1910年正式吞并朝鲜。

As Japan, Russia, and Britain competed for control of Asia, France largely refrained. Its principal
interest on the continent of Asia was Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia).

当日本、俄罗斯和英国争夺亚洲控制权时，法国基本上没有采取行动。它在亚洲大陆的主要利益是印
度支那（现在的越南、老挝和柬埔寨）。

Defeat in the Opium Wars of 1839 and 1856 had weakened it, and the
peace treaties concluding the Second Opium War had forced it to open additional ports and allow
British, French, Russian, and U.S. citizens to travel freely and enjoy the right of extraterritoriality,
meaning that while in China they were subject only to the laws of their own countries. China was
also forced to allow the practice of Christianity.


第二次鸦片战争结束的和平条约迫使它(中国)开放更多的港口，允许英国、法
国、俄罗斯和美国公民自由通行并享有治外法权，这意味着在中国他们只受本国法律的约束。中国也
被迫允许信仰基督教。


Following China’s defeat in 1895, European nations and the United States pushed for even more
advantages. France gained control over the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan. Britain
extended its influence along the Yangtze River Valley. Germany was given control of the Yellow River
Valley to the north as well as the Shandong Peninsula and Jiaozhou Bay. Soon nearly all the
industrialized nations had been granted concessions, enclaves within port cities such as Tianjin and
Shanghai, where they exercised the rights of extraterritoriality.

1895年中国战败后，欧洲国家和美国进一步谋取更多优势。法国控制了贵州、广西和云南省。英国的
影响力扩展到长江流域。德国控制了北部的黄河流域以及山东半岛和胶州湾。很快，几乎所有工业化
国家都获得了天津和上海等港口城市内的租界和飞地，在那里他们行使治外法权。

In 1900, several of these nations signed a treaty with the Chinese government at the urging of John
Hay, the U.S. secretary of state. The treaty established an Open Door policy in which China agreed
to trade with all countries on the same terms. In this way, none of the industrialized powers could
gain an advantage over the others. In exchange, they promised not to annex any of China’s territory.

1900年，
·海的敦促下，其中几个国家与中国政府签署了一项条约。该条约确立了门
户开放政策，中国同意以同等条件与所有国家进行贸易。这样一来，任何一个工业化国家都无法比其
他国家获得优势。作为交换，他们承诺不吞并任何中国领土。
