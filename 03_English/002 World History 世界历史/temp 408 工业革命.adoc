The automobile industry also increased the demand for rubber and petroleum, which most industrialized nations needed to import.

汽车还增加了对橡胶和石油的需求，而大多数工业化国家都需要进口。

The automobile’s arrival depended on another crucial invention—the internal combustion engine. Internal combustion engines powered automobiles as well as machinery in small workshops, offering an alternative where steam engines, which were large, could not easily fit.

汽车的出现取决于另一项重要的发明——内燃机。内燃机为汽车和小型车间的机械提供动力，为大型蒸汽机无法轻易安装的地方提供 代方案。

Electricity ran machines in factories and lit streets, workplaces, and homes following the invention of the incandescent light bulb, by Joseph Swan in Britain in 1878 and Thomas Edison in the United States in 1879.

继 1878 年英国的约瑟夫·斯旺 (Joseph Swan)和美国的托马斯·爱迪生 (Thomas Edison)于 1879 年发明白 泡后，电力为工厂的机器提供了动力，为街道、工作场所和家庭提供了照明。



Italy industrialized after other western and central European nations such as France and Germany. Th fragmented political system of the Italian peninsula before its unification as a single nation (which be in 1861) delayed general industrial development.

意大利的工业化程度仅次于法国和德国等其他西欧和中欧国家。意大利半岛在统一为一个国家（始于 18 年）之前，其政治体系支离破碎，阻碍了总体工业发展。

Russia had begun industrializing in the early nineteenth century.

十九世纪初，俄罗斯开始工业化

Russia remained relatively unindustrialized compared to the United States and much of western and central Europe.

与美国以及西欧和中欧大部分国家相比，俄罗斯的工业化程度仍然相对较低。

Russia lacked many advantages for industrializing that other countries possessed. It did not have many artisans. Russia’s population also consisted of many serfs who, unlike American and British farmers, were bound to the land and could not seek opportunities elsewhere such as in factories.

俄罗斯缺乏其他国家所拥有的许多工业化优势。它没有很多工匠. 与美国和英国的农民不同，俄罗斯的人口中也有许多农奴，他们被束缚在土地上，不能在工厂等其他地方寻找机会。

Following its defeat in the Crimean War, Russia increased its efforts to industrialize. In 1861, it abolished serfdom, providing potential workers for factories. However, Russia’s late start meant it did not reach the same level of industrialization as western and central Europe and the United States until the twentieth century.

克里米亚战争失败后，俄罗斯加大了工业化力度。 1861年，它废除了农奴制，为工厂提供了潜在的工人. 然而，俄罗斯起步 晚，直到20世纪才达到与西欧、中欧和美国同等的工业化水平。

As the United States and European nations industrialized, African, Latin American, and Asian nations, with the exception of Japan, did not. Historians disagree about the reasons for this Great Divergence.

Countries such as Egypt and the Latin American nations realized their strengths lay better in producing raw materials for the industrializing nations than pursuing widespread industrialization. In each nation, a unique set of circumstances influenced the path taken.

当美国和欧洲国家实现工业化时，非洲、拉丁美洲和亚洲国家（日本除外）却没有实现工业化。历史学家对于这次大分流的原因存在分歧。埃及和拉丁美洲国家等国家意识到自己的优势在于为工业化国家生产原材料, 而不是追求广泛的工业化。 个国家，一系列独特的情况影响了所采取的道路。(毕业就选择当谋技者的人，肯定就和选择当谋事者的人殊途了)

India’s industrial endeavors were greatly affected by its relationship with Britain, which had begun trading in India in the 1600s. The Seven Years’ War and the subsequent Treaty of Paris, signed in 1763, effectively brought French power in India to an end.

印度的工业发展深受其与英国关系的影响，英国在 1600 年代就开始与印度进行贸易。七年战争和随后于 1763 年签署的《巴黎条约》实际上结束了法国在印度的势力，

Britain, however, had no intention of allowing its colony to become its economic rival. Like all colonies, India was meant to enrich Britain, not compete with it. Thus began a process often referred to as deindustrialization, a reduction in a nation’s or region’s industrial activity.

然而，英国无意让其殖民地成为其经济竞争对手。和所有殖民地一样，印度的目的是让英国富裕起来， 是与之竞争。由此开始了一个通常被称为去工业化的过程，即一个国家或地区工业活动的减少。(用政策来抑制一个国家的产业升级)

China also did not become an industrial power in the nineteenth century. Historians have offered a variety of reasons.

First, no challengers in East Asia could match China in size, wealth, and military strength, so it had no need to compete with anyone. Second, because China’s population was large and often poor, labor was abundant and employers did not have to offer high wages to attract employees or replace workers with labor-saving machinery.

中国在十九世纪也没有成为工业强国。 学家提出了各种各样的理由。 首先，东亚的挑战者在规模、财富和军事实力上都无法与中国相比，因此没有必要与任何人竞争。其次 于中国人口众多且往往贫困，劳动力充足，雇主不必提供高工资来吸引员工或用节省劳动力的机器取代 人。

industrial development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had many consequences, short and long term. To generate profits for themselves and their investors, businesses needed to operate inexpensively and sell as many goods as possible. To keep costs and therefore prices low, they sought inexpensive raw materials. They also wanted markets in which to sell their finished goods, preferably without competing with others. The ships that transported raw materials and finished products required ports where they could refuel and resupply, as did the navies that kept them safe.

为了为自己和投资者创造利润，企业需要以低廉的成本运营并销售尽可能多的商品。为了降低成 本并降低价格，他们寻求廉价的原材料。他们还希望有市场来销售他们的制成品，最好不要与其他人 竞争。运输原材料和成品的船只需要港口来补充燃料和补给，保障船只安全的海军也需要港口。(生意的输入端（原材料）和输出端（消费者），都需要成本最小化，利益最大化)

To the industrial powers, these needs justified their practice of imperialism, that is, the policy of gaining direct or indirect control over parts of the world with low-cost resources and no competing mass-produced goods. The industrialized nations came to dominate states in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, taking natural resources and money from them.

对于工业强国来说，这些需要证明了他们的帝国主义做法是合理的，即利用低成本资源和没有竞争性 大批量生产的商品来直接或间接控制世界部分地区的政策。工业化国家开始主宰非洲、亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，从它们那里夺取自然资源和 金钱

The industrializing powers could satisfy their needs for raw materials and markets only by reaching outside their borders to places in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean. To amass large profits, however, they needed to extract raw materials at such low prices that it was unlikely Africans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders would consent to them. In addition, and also unlikely, these nations would have to agree to purchase manufactured goods from their industrialized partners even though they might be able to produce such things for themselves. Business owners and politicians in industrialized nations thus believed they needed to gain control over these distant countries and rule them as part of an empire. Quite often, military conquest was the means by which they did so. Once these foreign territories were secured, markets established, and funds invested, the imperial powers then needed to prevent encroachment on their possessions by other industrial powers. This led to them to exercise even greater control over their colonies and often to attempt to conquer neighboring regions. Great Britain, for example, competed with Russia for control of Afghanistan largely to limit Russian access to Britain’s prize colony of India.

工业化强国只有走出国门，进入非洲、亚洲和太平洋地区，才能满足对原材料和市场的需求。然而， 为了积累巨额利润，他们需要以极低的价格开采原材料，以至于非洲、亚洲和太平洋岛民不太可能同 意他们的做法。此外，也是不太可能的，这些国家必须同意从其工业化伙伴那里购买制成品，即使它 们可能能够为自己生产此类产品。因此，工业化国家的企业主和政治家认为，他们需要控制这些遥远 的国家，并将它们作为帝国的一部分进行统治。很多时候，军事征服是他们这样做的手段。一旦这些 外国领土获得安全、市场建立、资金投入，帝国列强就需要防止其他工业强国对其财产的侵犯。这导 致他们对殖民地实行更大的控制，并经常试图征服邻近地区。例如，英国与俄罗斯争夺对阿富汗的控 制权，主要是为了限制俄罗斯进入英国的殖民地印度。

The new colonies were quite different from those that European powers had established in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was not generally expected that large numbers of Europeans would relocate to Africa or Asia and make permanent homes there, and the colonies were not intended to have quite the same relationship to the home country that earlier “settler colonies” had had. The U.S. treatment of the Philippines and Filipinos was fundamentally different from what North American colonists had experienced from Great Britain, for example. The industrial nations intended to exploit the resources and people of the colonies they established, not settle them.

这些新殖民地与欧洲列强在十六、十七世纪建立的殖民地有很大不同。人们普遍预计，大量欧洲人不 会迁移到非洲或亚洲并在那里永久定居，殖民地也无意与母国建立与早期“定居者殖民地”完全相同的关 系。例如，美国对待菲律宾和菲律宾人的方式与北美殖民者在英国所经历的方式根本不同。工业国家 的目的是开发他们所建立的殖民地的资源和人民，而不是定居在那里。(更加功利化，工具化殖民地)

There were some exceptions. The North African colony of Algeria, which France had taken control of in 1830, was incorporated as part of France in 1848. Many French people and other Europeans immigrated to the coastal regions of Algeria and Tunisia with government encouragement in the nineteenth century. Many Europeans also settled in the British and Dutch colonies in southern Africa. However, this was not the imperial norm.

但也有一些例外。法国于 1830 年控制的北非殖民地阿尔及利亚，于 1848 年并入法国的一部分。十九 世纪，在政府的鼓励下，许多法国人和其他欧洲人移民到阿尔及利亚和突尼斯沿海地区。许多欧洲人 还定居在南部非洲的英国和荷兰殖民地。然而，这并不是帝国的常态。

Malaria was also a significant problem in Britain’s colony of India. It was exacerbated by schemes to dig irrigation canals and clear land for railroads, creating more areas for water to collect in breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that carried the disease. Quinine, which comes from the bark of the cinchona tree, had been used to treat malaria for years, and in the 1840s the British discovered that taking it before exposure could prevent people from ever contracting the disease. Cinchona trees grew only in the Andes, however, and there were not enough to meet the European demand. Attempts to plant cinchona trees elsewhere often failed, but by the 1870s the Dutch were successfully growing them in their colony of Indonesia and producing additional quinine.

疟疾也是英国殖民地印度的一个严重问题。挖掘灌溉渠和清理土地修建铁路的计划加剧了这种情况， 为携带这种疾病的蚊子的繁殖地创造了更多的积水区域。奎宁来自金鸡纳树的树皮，多年来一直被用 来治疗疟疾，1840 年代英国人发现在接触疟疾之前服用奎宁可以防止人们感染这种疾病。然而，金鸡 纳树只生长在安第斯山脉，不足以满足欧洲的需求。在其他地方种植金鸡纳树的尝试常常失败，但到 了 1870 年代，荷兰人在印度尼西亚殖民地成功种植了金鸡纳树，并生产了更多的奎宁

Besides disease, difficult terrain and dense brush also made European exploratory and military missions difficult. Following rivers inland was the easiest means of travel. However, most rivers were too shallow for sailing ships.

除了疾病之外，崎岖的地形和茂密的灌木丛也给欧洲的探索和军事任务带来了困难。沿着内陆河流行 驶是最简单的旅行方式。然而，大多数河流水位太浅，无法航行

In the later nineteenth century, the industrialized nations regarded their colonies as necessary sources of wealth and strength. Some, like Britain and France, had already established colonies a century or more before. Now they focused on tightening their control over these and acquiring more. The United States, Germany, and Japan lacked overseas colonies and now sought to acquire them.

十九世纪后期，工业化国家将其殖民地视为财富和力量的必要来源。英国和法国等一些国家在一个世 纪或更早之前就已经建立了殖民地。现在他们专注于加强对这些的控制并获取更多。美国、德国和日 本缺乏海外殖民地，现在正寻求获得它们。

Africa 非洲

At the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution, Europeans controlled about 10 percent of the African continent. By the end of the century, they controlled 90 percent, with the largest portions ruled by Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany. Portugal and Spain still claimed colonies acquired in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

第二次工 业革命初期，欧洲人控制了非洲大陆约10%的土地。到本世纪末，他们控制了90%的非洲，其中最大的部分由英国、法国、比利时和德国统治。 葡萄牙和西班牙仍然声称拥有在十四和十五世纪获得的殖民地

The “Scramble for Africa” reached its height during the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 when, without input from Africans, European nations simply allotted different parts of the continent to one another. Some agreements were formal recognitions of existing colonies and territories, while others recognized new claims. Colonization continued throughout the 1880s–1910s.

“争夺非洲”在1884 年至 1885 年柏林会议期间达到顶峰，当时欧洲国家在 没有非洲人参与的情况下，简单地将非洲大陆的不同部分分配给彼此。一些协议是对现有殖民地和领 土的正式承认，而另一些协议则承认新的主张。殖民化在 1880 年代至 1910 年代持续进行。

France 法国

France had been reluctant to claim colonies in Africa. It controlled the island of Gorée off the coast of Senegal and had a few trading posts in the interior. Beyond expanding into the interior of Senegal in the 1850s, however, it did little until the end of the nineteenth century, when the European powers met at the 1878 Congress of Berlin to decide the fate of the defeated Ottoman Empire’s possessions in North Africa. France received Tunisia.

法国一直不愿在非洲宣称拥有殖民地。它控制着塞内加尔海岸附近的戈雷岛，并在内陆拥有一些贸易 站。然而，除了在 1850 年代向塞内加尔内陆扩张之外，它几乎没有采取任何行动，直到 19 世纪末， 欧洲列强在1878 年柏林会议上召开会议，决定战败的奥斯曼帝国在北非领地的命运。法国接收了突尼 斯。

Tunisia had borrowed heavily from European powers to fund development and modernize its army. When it declared bankruptcy in 1869, Britain, France, and Italy established a commission to manage its finances and ensure repayment. At the Congress of Berlin, Italy hoped to gain Tunisia since a number of its citizens now lived there. Britain, however, did not wish Italy to control both sides of the Strait of Sicily, endangering British access to the eastern Mediterranean, but it did want French support for its claims to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Germany wished France to focus on North Africa rather than continental Europe, where Germany hoped to increase its own influence. Thus, France was given Tunisia, and Italy received the city of Tripoli in Libya instead.

突尼斯从欧洲大国借了大量资金来资助其军队的发展和现代化。 1869年该公司宣布破产后，英国、法 国和意大利成立了一个委员会来管理其财务并确保还款。在柏林会议上，意大利希望获得突尼斯，因 为现在有一些突尼斯公民居住在那里。然而，英国不希望意大利控制西西里海峡两岸，从而危及英国 进入东地中海的通道，但它确实希望法国支持其对地中海塞浦路斯岛的主权主张。德国希望法国将重 点放在北非而不是欧洲大陆，德国希望在欧洲大陆增加自己的影响力。因此，法国获得了突尼斯，而 意大利则获得了利比亚的黎波里市。

From 1880 to 1900 many parts of West Africa came under French cont.

从 1880 年到 1900 年，西非的许多地区都处于法国的控制之下

Great Britain 大不列颠

South Africa was Britain’s first toehold on the continent. In 1806, Britain took formal control over the Dutch Cape Colony, established by Dutch traders in the seventeenth century.

南非是英国在非洲大陆的第一个立足点。 1806 年，英国正式控制了 17 世纪荷兰商人建立的荷兰开普 殖民地。

Britain’s second area of interest in Africa was Egypt, an excellent source of cotton for its textile mills. The possibility of building a canal across the Isthmus of Suez, which divided Asia from Africa, had intrigued Europeans since the fifteenth century. Linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas would allow ships to reach the Indian and Pacific Oceans without sailing around the tip of Africa, greatly easing trade with South and East Asia. Construction began in 1859, and the Suez Canal opened to shipping in 1869.

英国在非洲感兴趣的第二个领域是埃及，该国纺织厂的棉花资源极好。自十五世纪以来，在将亚洲与 非洲分开的苏伊士地峡修建一条运河的可能性一直引起欧洲人的兴趣。连接地中海和红海将使船只无 需绕行非洲一角即可到达印度洋和太平洋，从而大大简化与南亚和东亚的贸易。1859年开始修建，1869年苏伊士运河通航.

Britain had initially opposed the canal. It threatened British domination over the main water route to Asia, which passed the British Cape Colony, and it made its prized colony of India more accessible —and more vulnerable. Britain’s attitude changed, however, when Ismail Pasha, who became khedive or viceroy of Egypt and Sudan following the death of his uncle Sa’id Pasha in 1863, found himself deeply in debt to European creditors, which made it possible for European interests to manipulate him. For example, he was forced to establish a dual court system in which accused Europeans were tried by European judges, not Egyptian ones. In 1875, unable to pay his debts, Ismail Pasha sold Egypt’s shares in the Suez Canal to Britain. He was also forced to allow British and French officials to manage Egypt’s financial affairs.

英国最初反对修建运河。它威胁到英国对通往亚洲的主要水路的统治，这条水路经过英属开普殖民地，它使英国珍贵的殖民地印度更容易接近，也更容易受到攻击。然而，当伊斯梅尔帕夏(Ismail Pasha)成为埃及和苏丹的总督时，英国的态度发生了变化，他发现自己深陷欧洲债权人的债务，这使得欧洲利益集团有可能操纵他。例如，他被迫建立了一个双重法庭系统，被指控的欧洲人由欧洲法官审判，而不是埃及法官。1875年，由于无力偿还债务，伊斯梅尔帕夏将埃及在苏伊士运河的股份卖给了英国。他还被迫允许英国和法国官员管理埃及的金融事务。

Germany 德国 Germany came late to the scramble for colonies, delayed by a number of factors. Until 1871, it consisted of a variety of German-speaking states and kingdoms in northern and central Europe, none wealthy or powerful enough to establish colonies. Once unified as a country in 1871, it still did not possess the ocean-going navy needed to trade with and defend colonies, and its first chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in office from 1871 until 1890, initially had no interest in an overseas empire. But by the 1880s he had changed his mind. In Africa, Germany staked its claim to regions scattered across the continent that had not already been colonized by France and England.

由于多种因素的影响，德国在争夺殖民地方面姗姗来迟。 1871 年之前，它由北欧和中欧的多个德语国 家和王国组成，但没有一个富裕或强大到足以建立殖民地。 1871年统一为一个国家后，它仍然不具备 与殖民地进行贸易和保卫殖民地所需的远洋海军，而且其第一任总理奥托·冯·俾斯麦（1871年至1890 年在位）最初对海外帝国没有兴趣。但到了 1880 年代，他改变了主意。在非洲，德国对分散在非洲大陆上尚未被法国和英国殖民的地区提出了主权 要求.

Italy 意大利

Italy was the last European power to establish colonies in Africa. In 1884, an Italian shipping company bought Assab Bay, a port city on the Red Sea, from a local sultan. In 1886, Italy took control of the Egyptian Red Sea port of Massawa at Britain’s urging to prevent France from acquiring more territory in the region.

意大利是最后一个在非洲建立殖民地的欧洲强国。 1884年，一家意大利航运公司从当地苏丹手中购买 了红海港口城市阿萨布湾。 1886年，在英国的敦促下，意大利控制了埃及红海港口马萨瓦，以阻止法 国在该地区获得更多领土。

Italy grasped the parts of Africa that lay unclaimed by other European powers.

意大利占领了其他欧洲列强无人认领的非洲部分地 区。

Despite Britain’s expansion into Africa, India remained its most important overseas territory. India had been a possession of the British East India Company, which directly ruled approximately half of India. In 1857, however, Muslim and Hindu soldiers in the company’s employ, known as sepoys, rose in revolt. In 1858, following the British army’s suppression of the revolt, Parliament disbanded the British East India Company and took control of the territory it had ruled. Local rulers whose authority the East India Company acknowledged and who had remained loyal were left in nominal control of their kingdoms, but in reality, they became subservient to Britain. Queen Victoria was officially proclaimed empress of India in 1876, and the last Mughal emperor, who had not been active in the revolt, was sent into exile. This transfer of power began the period of direct British rule called the British Raj.

尽管英国向非洲扩张，印度仍然是其最重要的海外领土。印度曾是英国东印度公司的属地，该公司直 接统治着大约一半的印度。然而，1857 年，该公司雇佣的穆斯林和印度教士兵（称为“土兵” ）发动叛 乱。 1858年，英国军队镇压叛乱后，议会解散了英国东印度公司，并控制了其统治的领土。东印度公 司承认其权威并保持忠诚的当地统治者名义上控制着自己的王国，但实际上，他们屈服于英国。 1876 年，维多利亚女王被正式封为印度女皇，而未积极参与叛乱的莫卧儿末代皇帝则被流放。这次权力转 移开始了英国直接统治的时期，称为“英属统治” 。

British attempts to gain control over regions of Asia beyond India and Hong Kong were often frustrated by Russia, which also sought to expand its influence there. The ongoing struggle between the two was called The Great Game. From the 1850s through the 1870s, Russia gained control of kingdoms occupied by Turkic-speaking peoples in central Asia and incorporated them into its empire as a region called Turkestan. Britain feared Russia would try to absorb India as well. To protect its prized possession, Britain sought to use the Emirate of Afghanistan as a buffer zone. When Russia gained control of much of what is now Turkmenistan in 1881, the two European nations jointly established the boundary line between an independent Afghanistan and Russian territory, ending a serious conflict between the two powers.

英国试图控制印度和香港以外的亚洲地区的努力常常遭到俄罗斯的挫败，俄罗斯也试图扩大其在该地 区的影响力。两人之间持续不断的斗争被称为“伟大的博弈” 。从 1850 年代到 1870 年代，俄罗斯控制 了中亚突厥语民族占领的王国，并将其纳入其帝国，称为突厥斯坦地区. 英国担心俄罗斯也会试图吞并印度。为了保 护其珍贵的财产，英国寻求利用阿富汗酋长国作为缓冲区。1881年，当俄罗斯控制 了现在的土库曼斯坦的大部分地区时，这两个欧洲国家共同划定了独立的阿富汗和俄罗斯领土之间的 边界线，结束了两国之间的严重冲突。

Lacking many of the raw materials necessary for industrialization, Japan, like other industrialized nations, began to seek them abroad. It first took control of the Ryukyu Islands and also claimed the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin Island. Russia, however, also laid claim to these territories, and for a while the two nations shared Sakhalin Island. In 1875, Japan relinquished its claims to the island in exchange for complete control over the Kurile Islands.

由于缺乏工业化所需的许多原材料，日本像其他工业化国家一样，开始 向国外寻求原材料。它首先控制了琉球群岛，并声称对千岛群岛和库页岛拥有主权。然 而，俄罗斯也声称对这些领土拥有主权，两国一度共享库页岛。 1875年，日本放弃对该岛的主权要 求，以换取对千岛群岛的完全控制。

Japan’s Empire. Unlike many European nations, Japan sought colonies closer to home, including the Ryukyu, Kurile, and Sakhalin Islands.

日本帝国。与许多欧洲国家不同，日本寻求离本土更近的殖民地，包括琉球群岛、千岛群岛和萨哈林群岛。

image:/img/0048.jpg[,100%]

Japan’s most desired prize was Korea. In 1873, Korea’s King Gojong began to consider opening the nation to the outside world. Anxious to gain an advantage, in 1876 Japan sent a gunboat to force Korea to sign the Japan-Korea Treaty of Amity (Ganghwa Treaty) before it could make commercial treaties with other nations. Among other provisions, the treaty allowed the Japanese to establish trading ports in addition to the one to which they already had access. It also let Japanese merchants live and work in Korea while subject only to Japanese law. In addition, Korea was declared to no longer be a tributary state of China.

日本最想要的战利品是朝鲜. 1873 年，韩国高宗国王开始考虑对外开放。由于急于获得优势，日本于 1876 年派 出一艘炮舰迫使韩国签署《日韩友好条约》 （《江华条约》），然后才可以与其他国家签订商业条 约。除其他条款外，该条约还允许日本在已有的贸易港口之外建立贸易港口。它还允许日本商人在韩 国生活和工作，但仅受日本法律的约束。此外，朝鲜宣布不再是中国的附属国

China did not wish to relinquish its control so easily, and a series of uprisings and mutinies in Korea in the 1880s gave it the opportunity to reassert its authority. In 1885, however, both Japan and China agreed to withdraw military forces from the peninsula in 1885. Although this temporarily prevented armed conflict between Japan and China, hostilities between the two soon commenced. In 1894, the pro-Japanese Korean leader Kim Ok-Kyun was murdered in Shanghai, and an outraged Japan awaited an opportunity to confront the Chinese. That same year, the Donghak Rebellion swept Korea as disgruntled peasants demanded social reforms, giving China an excuse to dispatch a military force to Korea in violation of its agreement with Japan. Japan in turn sent troops to confront the Chinese, and the First Sino-Japanese War began.

中国不想轻易放弃控制权，1880年代朝鲜发生的一系列起义和兵变给了它重新确立权威的机会。然 而，日本和中国在1885年同意从半岛撤军。虽然这暂时阻止了日本和中国之间的武装冲突，但两国之 间的敌对行动很快就开始了。 1894年，亲日的韩国领导人金玉均在上海被谋杀，愤怒的日本等待着与 中国对抗的机会。同年，东学起义席卷韩国，不满的农民要求社会改革，这给中国提供了借口，违反 与日本的协议向朝鲜派遣军队。日本随后出兵与中国对抗，甲午战争爆发。

Humiliated, China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which recognized Korea’s independence and conceded to Japan territory on the Liaodong Peninsula in Manchuria as well as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Japan had now acquired an empire. Japan quickly realized, however, that it would have to defend its gains from its old rival Russia. In 1896, Koreans, angered by the assassination of their pro-Chinese queen by Japanese agents, overthrew the pro-Japanese government then in power. As Japanese influence waned, Russian influence grew.

屈辱的中国于 1895年签署了《马关条约》 ，承认朝鲜独立，并将满洲辽东半岛、台湾和澎湖列岛的领土割让给日 本。日本现在已经获得了一个帝国。然而，日本很快意识到，它必须捍卫其从老对手俄罗斯手中获得 的利益。 1896年，韩国人对日本特工刺杀亲中国女王感到愤怒，推翻了当时掌权的亲日政府。随着日 本影响力的减弱，俄罗斯影响力的增强.

Russia also began to encroach upon Japanese territory in Manchuria. Russia’s one Pacific port, Vladivostok, was often frozen over. Seeking a harbor that was ice-free year-round, Russia leased land from China on the Liaodong Peninsula in 1897 and built a new port, Port Arthur. A wary Japan offered Russia free rein on the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for Japan’s retaining control over Korea. When Russia refused to compromise, Japan attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur in the winter of 1904, beginning the Russo-Japanese War. Once again, Japan emerged victorious over a much larger nation. The Treaty of Portsmouth, signed in September 1905, acknowledged Japan’s right to Korea and awarded Japan control of southern Manchuria. Japan formally annexed Korea in 1910.

俄罗斯也开始侵占日本在满洲的领土。俄罗斯的太平洋港口之一符拉迪沃斯托克经常被冰冻。为了寻 求一个常年不冻的港口，俄罗斯于1897年从中国租用了辽东半岛的土地，建造了一个新的港口——旅 顺港。警惕的日本向俄罗斯提供了对辽东半岛的自由支配权，以换取日本保留对朝鲜的控制。当俄罗 斯拒绝妥协时，日本于 1904 年冬天袭击了旅顺港的俄罗斯舰队，日俄战争爆发。日本再次战胜了一个 更大的国家。 1905 年 9 月签署的《朴茨茅斯条约》承认日本对朝鲜的权利，并授予日本对满洲南部的 控制权。日本于1910年正式吞并朝鲜。

As Japan, Russia, and Britain competed for control of Asia, France largely refrained. Its principal interest on the continent of Asia was Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia).

当日本、俄罗斯和英国争夺亚洲控制权时，法国基本上没有采取行动。它在亚洲大陆的主要利益是印 度支那（现在的越南、老挝和柬埔寨）。

Defeat in the Opium Wars of 1839 and 1856 had weakened it, and the peace treaties concluding the Second Opium War had forced it to open additional ports and allow British, French, Russian, and U.S. citizens to travel freely and enjoy the right of extraterritoriality, meaning that while in China they were subject only to the laws of their own countries. China was also forced to allow the practice of Christianity.

第二次鸦片战争结束的和平条约迫使它(中国)开放更多的港口，允许英国、法 国、俄罗斯和美国公民自由通行并享有治外法权，这意味着在中国他们只受本国法律的约束。中国也 被迫允许信仰基督教。

Following China’s defeat in 1895, European nations and the United States pushed for even more advantages. France gained control over the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan. Britain extended its influence along the Yangtze River Valley. Germany was given control of the Yellow River Valley to the north as well as the Shandong Peninsula and Jiaozhou Bay. Soon nearly all the industrialized nations had been granted concessions, enclaves within port cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai, where they exercised the rights of extraterritoriality.

1895年中国战败后，欧洲国家和美国进一步谋取更多优势。法国控制了贵州、广西和云南省。英国的 影响力扩展到长江流域。德国控制了北部的黄河流域以及山东半岛和胶州湾。很快，几乎所有工业化 国家都获得了天津和上海等港口城市内的租界和飞地，在那里他们行使治外法权。

In 1900, several of these nations signed a treaty with the Chinese government at the urging of John Hay, the U.S. secretary of state. The treaty established an Open Door policy in which China agreed to trade with all countries on the same terms. In this way, none of the industrialized powers could gain an advantage over the others. In exchange, they promised not to annex any of China’s territory.

1900年， ·海的敦促下，其中几个国家与中国政府签署了一项条约。该条约确立了门 户开放政策，中国同意以同等条件与所有国家进行贸易。这样一来，任何一个工业化国家都无法比其 他国家获得优势。作为交换，他们承诺不吞并任何中国领土。

The Pacific 太平洋

Colonization of the Pacific by Europeans had begun as early as the sixteenth century when Spain claimed the Philippines. Over the course of the eighteenth through the early nineteenth centuries, France and Britain had also laid claim to the islands of the Pacific. Britain established a colony in Australia in 1788 and colonized New Zealand in 1840. France made Tahiti a protectorate in 1842. In the second half of the nineteenth century, those islands that did not already belong to a great power were quickly absorbed into larger colonial empires.

早在十六世纪西班牙宣称拥有菲律宾主权时，欧洲人就开始了对太平洋的殖民活动。从十八世纪到十 九世纪初，法国和英国也对太平洋岛屿提出了主权要求。英国于1788年在澳大利亚建立殖民地，并于 1840年对新西兰进行殖民统治。法国于1842年将塔希提岛设为保护国。在19世纪下半叶，那些原本不 属于大国的岛屿很快被更大的殖民帝国吞并。

In some cases, competing powers agreed to share possession of large islands or island chains. For example, in 1899, Germany, Britain, and the United States formally agreed to divide the Samoan islands between Germany, which took control of those now known as Samoa, and the United States, which received those now called American Samoa. In exchange for Britain’s forfeiting any claim to the islands, Germany gave it control of some of the territory it had settled in the North Solomon Islands and made concessions regarding its holdings in Africa.

在某些情况下，竞争大国同意分享大岛屿或岛链的所有权。例如，1899年，德国、英国和美国正式同 意将萨摩亚群岛划分给德国和美国，德国控制了现在称为萨摩亚的岛屿，而美国则接收了现在称为美 属萨摩亚的岛屿。作为英国放弃对这些岛屿的任何主权要求的交换条件，德国给予其在北所罗门群岛 定居的部分领土的控制权，并就其在非洲的领土做出让步。

The United States was particularly active in the Pacific. Unlike the other industrial powers, it had not attempted to claim any parts of Africa or Asia beyond some trading concessions in China. Throughout the later nineteenth century, it was developing the land and exploiting the resources within its North American borders. It pushed steadily westward from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, acquiring territory by purchase, treaty, or conquest from France, Britain, and Mexico on the way. To clear the land for use by farmers, ranchers, miners, and timber companies, by the end of the century the federal government had confined the Indigenous peoples to reservations. In 1867, it purchased the Russian colony of Alaska. By the 1890s, it had settled all its vast territory and began to look abroad. The United States wanted access to the wealth of China as well as land to grow sugarcane, one of the food commodities it could not produce in a quantity to suit its needs.

美国在太平洋地区尤其活跃。与其他工业强国不同的是，除了中国的一些贸易让步之外，它并没有试 图对非洲或亚洲的任何地区提出主权要求。在整个十九世纪后期，它一直在北美境内开发土地并开采 资源。它从大西洋稳步向西推进到太平洋，途中通过购买、条约或征服从法国、英国和墨西哥获得领 土。为了清理土地供农民、牧场主、矿工和木材公司使用，联邦政府在本世纪末将原住民限制在保留 地。 1867年，它购买了俄罗斯殖民地阿拉斯加。到了1890年代，它已经在其广阔的领土上定居下来， 并开始放眼海外。美国希望获得中国的财富以及种植甘蔗的土地，甘蔗是美国无法生产满足其需求的 粮食商品之一。

The United States’ first significant move to acquire territory for an empire beyond the North American mainland was to take control of Hawaii. Although it had annexed a number of minor islands in the Pacific, including Baker Island, Howland Island, and Midway Atoll, it had done so only with the intent of collecting guano for fertilizer and did not develop or settle them.

美国为建立北美大陆以外的帝国而采取的第一个重大举措是控制夏威夷。尽管它吞并了太平洋上的一 些小岛，包括贝克岛、豪兰岛和中途岛环礁，但它这样做的目的只是为了收集鸟粪作为肥料，而不是 开发或定居这些岛屿。

In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii.

1898年，美国吞并夏威夷。

In December 1898, Spain recognized Cuba’s independence, ceded Guam and Puerto Rico to the United States, and allowed the United States to purchase the Philippines.

(美西战争后,) 1898年12月，西班牙承认古巴独立，将关岛和波多黎各 割让给美国，并允许美国购买菲律宾。

The Philippines’ proximity to China attracted those who sought to trade with the latter. Many feared Japan or a European power like Germany would seize control of the islands if the United States did not stake its claim to them. Indeed, Germany attempted to establish a base in the Philippines only a few weeks after the Spanish forces surrendered.

菲律宾毗邻中国，吸引了那些 寻求与中国进行贸易的人。许多人担心，如果美国不表明对这些岛屿的主权，日本或德国等欧洲大国 就会夺取这些岛屿的控制权。事实上，西班牙军队投降后仅几周，德国就试图在菲律宾建立基地。

And just beyond the Philippines are China’s illimitable markets. We will not renounce our part in the mission of our race, trustee, under God, of the civilization of the world. And we will move forward to our work, not howling out regrets like slaves whipped to their burdens but with gratitude for a task worthy of our strength and thanksgiving to Almighty God that He has marked us as His chosen people, henceforth to lead in the regeneration of the world.

就在菲律宾以外，是中国无限的市场。我们不会放弃我们在种族使命中的角色——在上帝之下，作为世界文明的托管者。我们将向前迈进，迎接我们的任务，不是像被鞭打到负担前的奴隶那样哀嚎后悔，而是心怀感激，感谢这个与我们力量相称的任务，并感谢全能的上帝，他将我们标记为他所选的人民，从此领导世界的复兴。

This island empire is the last land left in all the oceans. If it should prove a mistake to abandon it, the blunder once made would be irretrievable. . . .

这个岛屿帝国是所有海洋中仅存的最后一块陆地。如果放弃是错误的，那么一旦犯下的 错误就无法挽回了。 。

More and more Europe will manufacture the most it needs, secure from its colonies the most it consumes. Where shall we turn for consumers of our surplus? China is our natural customer. . . . The Philippines give us a base at the door of all the East.

越来越多的欧洲将生产其所 需的大部分产品，并从其殖民地获得其消费的大部分产品。我们该去哪里寻找剩余的消 费者呢？中国是我们天然的客户。 。 。 。菲律宾给了我们一个 位于整个东方门口的基地。

The primary motivation of the imperial powers in acquiring colonies was economic. Even when they believed their intentions were benevolent and would improve the lives of Africans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders, their means were often cruel.

帝国列强获取殖民地的主要动机是经济性的。即使他们 相信自己的意图是仁慈的，并且会改善非洲人、亚洲人和太平洋岛民的生活，但他们的手段往往是残 酷的。

In 1899, the Boxers began their campaign to drive foreigners from China. Terrified foreigners streamed into Beijing seeking protection, but Cixi encouraged them to leave. Fearing for their lives, they barricaded themselves inside the embassies in the foreign quarter of Beijing. Cixi then proclaimed her allegiance to the Boxers and declared war on foreigners within China.

1899年，义和团开始了他们的驱逐外国 人出中国的运动. 惊恐万状的外国人涌入北京寻求保护，但慈禧鼓励 他们离开。由于担心自己的生命安全，他们把自己关在北京涉外区的使馆内。慈禧随后宣布效忠义和 团，并向中国境内的外国人宣战。

Swiftly Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Japan, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Italy formed the Eight-Nation Alliance, and their troops raced to Beijing. After a siege of fifty-five days, the international force arrived and the Boxers were dispersed, killed, or captured. In September 1901, the Boxer Protocol was signed, officially ending the incident. China was forbidden to import weapons for two years, and foreign legations were given the right to keep troops of their own nation for their defense. China also awarded $330 million to the members of the Eight-Nation Alliance.

英、法、德、美、日、俄、奥匈、意等国迅速组成八国同盟，兵力奔赴北京。经过五十五天的围困后，国际部队抵达，义和团被驱散、杀害或俘虏。 1901年9 月，《庚子议 定书》签署，事件正式结束。中国被禁止在两年内进口武器，外国使馆有权保留本国军 队用于防卫。中国还向八国联盟成员提供了3.3亿美元的援助。

Politically: Repeated breach of pledges to give the natives a fair and reasonable share in the higher administration of their own country, which has much shaken confidence in the good faith of the British word. Political aspirations and the legitimate claim to have a reasonable voice in the legislation and the imposition and disbursement of taxes, met to a very slight degree, thus treating the natives of India not as British subjects, in whom representation is a birthright. Consequent on the above, an utter disregard of the feelings and views of the natives.

(印度对英国的看法: ) 政治上：一再违反让当地人在自己国家的高级管理中享有公平合理份额的承诺，这极大 地动摇了人们对英国话语诚信的信心。政治愿望和在立法以及征税和支付方面拥有合理 发言权的合法要求得到了非常轻微的满足，因此印度人不被视为英国臣民，而代表权是 英国人与生俱来的权利。综上所述，完全无视当地人的感受和观点。

The natives call the British system Sakar ki Churi, the knife of sugar. That is to say, there is no oppression, it is all smooth and sweet, but it is the knife, notwithstanding.

当地人将英国 的系统称为 Sakar ki Churi，即糖刀。也就是说，没有任何压迫感，一切都是顺滑而甜 蜜的，但尽管如此，那是刀。

The Second Industrial Revolution began in the second half of the nineteenth century and lasted until the start of World War I.

第二次工业革命始于十九世纪下半叶，一直持续到第一次世界大战开始

Before the nineteenth century, life changed little from one era to the next. Generations of people worked on farms. If they did not live on isolated farms, they inhabited small villages and usually did not venture far from the place where they were born. They raised enough food to feed themselves and sold any surplus in market towns, using their earnings to buy only the handcrafted goods they could not make for themselves. Beautiful works of art were sculpted or painted, music composed, and poems written, but before the Industrial Revolution, most ordinary people never saw, heard, or read them. All that changed in the nineteenth century, as new forms of technology and new sources of power transformed the way people in industrialized nations lived.

十九世纪之前，生活从一个时代到下一个时代几乎没有什么变化。一代又一代的人们在农场劳作. 人们通常不会冒险远离他们的出生地。他们种植了足够的食物来养活自己，并在 集镇上出售剩余的食物，用他们的收入只购买他们自己无法制作的手工艺品。在伦敦和巴黎等世界 上为数不多的大城市，有科学发现，但对大多数人口影响甚微。美丽的艺术作品被雕刻或绘画，创作 音乐，写诗，但在工业革命之前，大多数普通人从未见过、听到或读过它们。十九世纪(工业革命使人们传统的那种生活和工作方式, 彻底改变了)，随着新技术 和新能源改变了工业化国家人们的生活方式，一切都发生了变化。

Some of the most profound changes brought by industrialization were those that affected the workplace, bringing new challenges while also transforming the nature of labor.

工业化带来的一些最深刻的变化影响了工作场所，带来了新的挑战，同时也改变了劳动的性质。

Perhaps the greatest change was the development of a new source of energy—electricity. Water power had earlier replaced animal power, and steam engines fueled by burning coal had driven the machinery of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

With electric lights, the factory floor could be lit twenty-four hours a day, and workers could labor long into the night in all seasons.

也许最大的变化是新能源——电力的开发。水力较早地取代了畜力，以燃煤为燃料的蒸汽机驱动了十 八世纪末十九世纪初的机械。到十九世纪末，电力也取代了蒸汽。有了电灯，工厂车间就可以一天二十四小时都亮着，工人们可以在任何季节工作到深夜。

Assembly lines and the mechanization of each step of the manufacturing process meant that, for the most part, factory work was unskilled in nature. Laborers lived with the knowledge that they could be replaced at any moment. Some work, like the repairing of machines, was skilled. Most, though, performed repetitive tasks that anyone could master with a bit of instruction. The assembly line reduced employees’ sense of contribution to the finished process and rendered work boring and repetitive, almost transforming workers into machines themselves.

装配线和制造过程每个步骤的机械化意味着，在很大程度上，工厂工作本质上是非技术性的。工人们 知道，他们随时可能被替换。有些工作，比如修 理机器，是需要技术的。不过，大多数人执行的是重复性 任务，任何人都可以通过一些指导来掌握。装配线降低了员工对成品流程的贡献感，使工作变得枯燥 和重复，几乎将工人本身变成了机器。

Nineteenth-century workers commonly toiled ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week. In 1897 in Russia, reform laws reduced the workday from fourteen hours (and sometimes as many as eighteen) to only eleven and a half.

Luckily for the subjects of the tsar, the majority of Russian factory workers could look forward to nearly one hundred holidays per year. They would have been envied by Japan’s cotton spinners, teenaged women who often worked for seventeen-hour stretches punctuated only by short breaks.

十九世纪的工人通常每天工作十到十二个小时，每周工作六天。 1897 年，俄罗斯改革法将工作日从十 四小时（有时多达十八小时）减少到只有十一个半小时。对于沙皇的臣民来说幸运的是，大多数俄罗斯工厂工人每年可以期待近一百个假期。她们会受到日本棉纺工的羡慕，这些十几岁的女性经常连续工作十七个小时，中间只有短暂的休息。

Adult men were the most highly paid workers. Adult women earned about half as much, and children less than adults, often only a quarter of an adult male’s pay. Work was not always steady; workplaces sometimes shut down unexpectedly when raw materials or work orders fell short. This meant that low pay was often accompanied by periodic unemployment, for which workers had no safety net. Most governments did not provide unemployment insurance, and government-subsidized housing for the poor did not exist. When workers lost their jobs, they were forced to turn to religious institutions or private charities for money for food and rent.

成年男性是收入最高的工人。成年女性的收入约为成年男性的一半，儿童的收入则低于成人，通常只 有成年男性的四分之一。工作并不总是稳定的；当原材料或工单短缺时，工作场所有时会意外关闭。 这意味着低工资往往伴随着周期性失业，而工人没有安全网。大多数政府不提供失业保险，也不存在 为穷人提供的政府补贴住房。当工人失业时，他们被迫向宗教机构或私人慈善机构寻求食物和租金。

Between 1873 and the end of the century, periodic recessions and depressions alternated with boom periods, rocking economies around the world.

1873 年至本世纪 末，周期性的衰退和萧条与繁荣时期交替出现，震撼了世界各地的经济。

Factory owners faced a growing number of competitors. They responded by increasing the pace of work.

工厂主面临着越来越多的竞争对手。他们的回 应是加快工作节奏。

The pace and long hours of mechanized labor took a toll on workers’ health and safety. Injuries were common. Fingers and hands were often lost to moving machine parts. Constant standing resulted in back problems, swollen feet, and miscarriages. In textile factories, inhaled fibers caused breathing problems that left workers permanently disabled. The constant noise of machinery led to hearing loss. Summer temperatures combined with the heat generated by machinery and moving bodies left workers on the brink of heat exhaustion. Laborers in Japan’s silk industry were often scalded while boiling silkworm cocoons. Toxic chemicals used in largely unregulated production processes also played havoc with workers’ health and safety. In some places, workers, especially women, were beaten by their supervisors; young women sent to work in the Japanese cotton industry by their impoverished parents were often caned or whipped.

机械化劳动的速度和长时间对工人的健康和安全造成了损害。受伤很常见。手指和手经常因移动的机 器部件而失去作用。持续站立会导致背部问题、脚肿胀和流产。在纺织工厂，吸入纤维会导致呼吸问 题，导致工人永久残疾。持续不断的机械噪音导致听力损失。夏季气温加上机械和移动物体产生的热 量使工人们处于中暑的边缘。日本丝绸业的工人在煮蚕茧时经常被烫伤。在很大程度上不受监管的生 产过程中使用的有毒化学品也对工人的健康和安全造成严重破坏。在一些地方，工人，特别是妇女， 遭到主管的殴打；被贫穷的父母送到日本棉花行业工作的年轻女性经常遭到鞭打或鞭打。

Occupational Disease: Phosphorus Necrosis

职业病：磷坏死

This set of undated photographs depicts a Dutch woman whose lower jaw has been eaten away by phosphorus, a condition commonly known as “phossy jaw.” The use of phosphorus for match production in the Netherlands was banned in 1901.

这组未注明日期的照片描绘了一位荷兰妇女，她的下颌已被磷侵蚀，这种情况通常被称为“下颌磷”。荷兰于 1901 年禁止 在火柴生产中使用磷。

Living in a working-class quarter, coming in contact with laborers and their wives, I could not fail to hear tales of the dangers that workingmen faced, of cases of carbonmonoxide gassing in the great steel mills, of painters disabled by lead palsy, of pneumonia and rheumatism among the men in the stockyards. Illinois then had no legislation providing compensation for accident or disease caused by occupation. . .

生活在工人阶级居住区，与工人及其妻子接触，我不可能不听到关于工人所面临的危 险、大型钢铁厂中一氧化碳中毒事件、油漆工因铅麻痹而致残的故事。 ，畜牧场里的 男人患有肺炎和风湿病。伊利诺伊州当时没有立法为职业造成的事故或疾病提供赔偿。

Phossy jaw is a very distressing form of industrial disease. It comes from breathing the fumes of white or yellow phosphorus, which gives off fumes at room temperature, or from putting into the mouth food or gum or fingers smeared with phosphorus. Even drinking from a glass which has stood on the workbench is dangerous. The phosphorus penetrates into a defective tooth and down through the roots to the jawbone, killing the tissue cells which then become the prey of suppurative germs from the mouth, and abscesses form. The jaw swells and the pain is intense. . . . Sometimes the abscess forms in the upper jaw and works up into the orbit, causing the loss of an eye. In severe cases one lower jawbone may have to be removed, or an upper jawbone—perhaps both.

颌骨磷灰石是一种非常令人痛苦的工业病。它来自于呼吸白磷或黄磷的烟雾，这些烟雾 在室温下会释放出烟雾，或者来自于将涂有磷的食物、口香糖或手指放入口中。即使用 放在工作台上的玻璃杯喝水也是危险的。磷渗透到有缺陷的牙齿中，穿过牙根到达颌 骨，杀死组织细胞，然后这些组织细胞成为口腔中化脓细菌的猎物，并形成脓肿。下巴 肿胀并且疼痛剧烈。 。 。 。有时，脓肿形成于上颌，并蔓延至眼眶，导致失去一只眼 睛。在严重的情况下，可能需要切除一根下颌骨，或者一根上颌骨，或者两者都被切 除。

Despite low pay, long hours, and difficult conditions of factory work, many working-class people preferred it to other types of available labor. Jobs like driving wagons and unloading ships were also low-paying jobs but required working outside in all kinds of weather. Railroad workers were vulnerable to incapacitating injuries from being caught between railcars or falling under their wheels. Miners toiled in dark, cramped environments, where temperatures sometimes rose so high they had to work naked to keep from passing out. Cave-ins were a constant threat. Industrial labor, regardless of the type, was also more highly paid than agricultural labor.

尽管工厂工作工资低、工作时间长、条件艰苦，但与其他类型的可用劳动力相比，许多工人阶级更喜 欢它。驾驶货车和卸船等工作也是低薪工作，但需要在各种天气下在户外工作。铁路工人很容易因被 夹在火车车厢之间或跌倒在车轮下而受伤而丧失能力。矿工们在黑暗、狭窄的环境中辛勤劳作，有时 温度会升得很高，他们不得不赤身裸体工作，以免昏倒。塌方是一个持续存在的威胁。工业劳动力， 无论何种类型，其工资也高于农业劳动力。

Factory work was especially desirable to unmarried women, whose most common alternative was domestic service. Living in their employers’ homes, domestic workers were expected to be available at all times of the day and night, were constantly watched, and made very little money. On the factory floor, unmarried young women might be sexually harassed by male employers, supervisors, or coworkers.

工厂工作对未婚女性来说尤其有吸引力，她们最常见的选择是家政服务。住在雇主家中的家庭佣工被 要求全天候待命，经常受到监视，而且赚的钱很少。在工厂车间，未婚的年轻女性可能会受 到男性雇主、主管或同事的性骚扰。

Because women were paid less than men, unmarried women did not earn enough to live independently. They tended to live at home, where they were expected to give their wages to their parents and accept a small allowance in return. Even if they rented living quarters with other female workers and shared expenses, they might grant sexual favors to young men in exchange for meals or clothes, a form of casual prostitution known as “treating.” Nevertheless, many young female factory workers enjoyed relative independence before marriage, and the inexpensive entertainment found in industrial cities.

由于女性的工资低于男性，未婚女性的收入不足以独立生活。他们往往住在家里，将工资交给父母并 接受少量津贴作为回报。即使她们与其他女工合租住所并分摊费用，她们也可能向年轻男性提供性好 处，以换取食物或衣服，这是一种被称为“招待”的临时卖淫形式。尽管如此，许多年轻的工厂女工在婚 前享有相对独立，以及在工业城市找到的廉价娱乐活动。

Industrialization brought profound changes to countries like Britain, France, Germany, and the United States.

工业化给英、法、德、美等国带来了深刻变化。(科技改变生活方式，于是旧的生活传统就消失了，再也回不去，成了回忆)

Pasteur’s discoveries also led to the pasteurization of milk beginning in the 1860s, making it safer to drink by heating it to destroy pathogens. The development of the antiseptic method by Joseph Lister in the 1860s and the identification of human blood types in 1901, which made safe blood transfusions possible, transformed the practice of surgery.

巴斯德的发现还导致从 1860 年代开 始对牛奶进行巴氏灭菌，通过加热消灭病原体，使其饮用更安全。约瑟夫·李斯特 (Joseph Lister)在 1860 年代发明了消毒方法，并在 1901 年对人类血型进行了鉴定，使安全输血成为可能，从而改变了 手术实践。

Between 1876 and 1901, life expectancy for a German man rose from thirty-four to forty-five years. A German woman born in 1876 could expect to live until she was thirty-seven years old; the average German woman born in 1901 lived to be forty-eight years old.

1876 年至 1901 年间，德国男性的预期寿命从 34 岁 增加到 45 岁。 1876 年出生的德国女性预计可以活到 37 岁； 1901 年出生的德国女性平均寿命为 48 岁。

As people moved from small farms and country villages to cities and factory towns, their lives changed in ways both small and profound. On farms and in artisans’ workshops, women and children had labored alongside husbands and fathers and contributed to the family’s income. They did not always have similar opportunities in the industrial city.

当人们从小农场和乡村迁移到城市和工厂城镇时，他们的生活发生了微小而深刻的变化。在农场和工 匠作坊里，妇女和儿童与丈夫和父亲一起劳动，为家庭收入做出了贡献。他们在工业城市并不总是有 类似的机会。(不得不进入另一种模式轨道中，而不管你喜不喜欢)

Early in the Industrial Revolution, women and children worked in factories, but by the end of the nineteenth century, this situation had changed. Although increasing mechanization meant that workers needed less physical strength, the presence of women and children in the workplace declined.

工业革命初期，妇女和儿童在工厂工作，但到了十九世纪末，这种情况发生了变化。尽管机械化程度 的提高意味着工人需要的体力减少，但工作场所中妇女和儿童的数量却有所减少。

Indeed, many male laborers blamed women’s willingness to accept low wages for keeping their own pay low, and they sought to push women out of the workplace. In the United States and western Europe, children also had largely ceased working in most factories by the beginning of the twentieth century. Greater mechanization of the workplace eliminated the jobs that children had once been employed to do. Increasingly, too, governments passed laws that attempted to ban child labor.

事实上，许多男性劳动者指责女性愿意接受低工资，导致自己的工资保持在较低水平，并试图将女性 赶出工作场所。在美国和西欧，到二十世纪初，大多数工厂里的儿童也基本上停止了工作。工作场所 机械化程度的提高消除了曾经雇用儿童从事的工作。各国政府也越来越多地通过了试图禁止童工的法 律。 Britain, the first nation to industrialize, led the way in eliminating child labor.

英国作为第一个工业化国家，在消除童工方面处于领先地位。

In the face of such opposition to limits on it, child labor continued until laws requiring compulsory education helped to move children from factories to schoolrooms. By the end of the nineteenth century, new laws in the United States and western and central Europe mandated schooling, largely eliminating formal wage work by children under the age of fourteen.

面对对限制童工的反对，童工现象仍在继续，直到义务教育法律帮助儿童从工厂转移到学校为止。到 十九世纪末，美国以及西欧和中欧的新法律强制要求接受教育，很大程度上消除了十四岁以下儿童的 正式工资工作。

by the beginning of the twentieth century in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany, working-class wives tended to supplement the family’s income by working at home, not outside it. Unmarried women and those whose husbands were disabled or absent still sought factory work, but married women more commonly earned money in ways that did not require them to leave the home. Some cared for the children of working neighbors and took in laundry. If the family’s living space were large enough, they might take in boarders. Many women did piecework at home, compensated based on the number of items produced. They collected materials from local businesses and assembled small items like toys, costume jewelry, or artificial flowers. Some stitched together items of clothing. They were often joined by their children, who might also hawk newspapers and peddle wares on the street.

到了二十世纪初，在美国、法国、英国和德国，工人阶级的妻子倾向于在家工作 而不是外出工作来补充家庭收入。未婚妇女和丈夫残疾或不在身边的妇女仍然寻求工厂工作，但已婚 妇女更常见的是通过不需要离开家的方式赚钱。有些人照顾工作邻居的孩子并洗衣服. 。如果家里的居 住空间足够大，他们可能会收住寄宿生. 许多妇女在家做计件工作，根据生产的物品数量获得报酬。他们从当地企业收 集材料并组装玩具、人造珠宝或人造花等小物品。有些人把衣服缝在一起。他们的孩子经常加入他们 的行列，孩子们也可能在街上兜售报纸和兜售商品.

By the beginning of the nineteenth century middle-class families had reduced the number of children they had. By the second half of the century, however, children could no longer earn their keep alongside their parents in the factory and instead had to be fed and clothed during their school years from a smaller pool of money. They then became an expense many working-class families could not afford. The inadequate and overcrowded urban housing available to the industrial working class also made large families undesirable.

到十九世纪初，中产阶级家庭已 经减少了孩子的数量。到了本世纪下半叶，孩子们再也无法与父母一起在工厂谋生，而在上学期间只能靠更 少的钱来维持衣食。然后，它们就成为许多工薪阶层家庭无法承受的开支。工业工人阶级可获得的城 市住房不足且过度拥挤，这也使得大家庭变得不受欢迎。.

Beginning in the 1870s, working-class families began to shrink in size, and by the start of the twentieth century, the average family size for laborers had dropped from four to six children to two to four, only slightly larger than among the middle class.

从1870年代开 始，工人阶级家庭规模开始缩小，到了20世纪初，工人的平均家庭规模从4至6个孩子减少到2至4个， 仅略高于中产阶级。

City air was also dirty in the late nineteenth century. Coal was burned to generate both steam power and electricity, and coal smoke plagued industrial cities as they grew in size.

十九世纪末，城市空气也很脏。燃烧煤炭来产生蒸汽动力和电力，随着工业城市规模的扩大，煤烟一 直困扰着它们。

Respiratory problems caused by the inhalation of coal smoke affected many in the nineteenth century. Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma were common. Approximately one-third of child deaths in nineteenth-century England were attributed to respiratory ailments.

十九世纪，许多人因吸入煤烟而引起呼吸系统疾病。肺气 肿、慢性支气管炎和哮喘很常见。十九世纪英国大约三分之一的儿童死亡归因于呼吸系统疾病。

Prostitution, both formal and informal, was common in nineteenth-century cities. Some prostitutes were professionals who lived in brothels, but many others were simply young single women who could not survive on their meager wages alone. Sexually transmitted diseases were rampant, however. Many prostitutes and their clients suffered from syphilis, and married men sometimes infected their wives. The result was infertility or babies who were stillborn or blind or had mental disabilities. With no effective cure, syphilis killed its victims after years of agony.

正式和非正式的卖淫在十九世纪的城市中都很常见。有些妓女是住在妓院的专业人士，但其他许多妓 女只是年轻的单身女性，仅靠微薄的工资无法生存。然而，性传播疾病却十分猖獗。许多妓女及其嫖客都患有梅毒， 已婚男子有时也会传染给他们的妻子。结果是不孕、婴儿死产、失明或患有精神障碍。由于没有有效 的治疗方法，梅毒在多年的痛苦后杀死了受害者。
