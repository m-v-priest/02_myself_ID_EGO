== 绝对君主制

Absolute monarchies appeared in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as feudalism declined and new countries arose from medieval kingdoms.

十六、十七世纪，随着封建主义的衰落, 和中世纪王国中新国家的崛起，欧洲出现了"绝对君主制"。


These new nation-states were characterized by

这些新的民族国家的特点是:

|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 君主不服从任何人, 自己一人做出任何政策.
|centralized administrations and codified laws.

中央进行"集权"的行政管理, 和有"成文的法律"。+

At the head of the state stood a monarch (usually a king) who claimed a divine right to rule. The medieval concept of monarchy had regarded kings as subservient to the pope, but absolute monarchs considered themselves subordinate to no one. They could rule as they wished with no need to confer with or seek the consent of others, or to share power with the noble class as medieval monarchs had done.

Absolute monarchs proclaimed their own laws, formulated foreign policy, administered justice (or appointed those who did so), and imposed taxes as they wished. They were the sole source of authority in their lands and often took steps to weaken the power of their nobles so they did not pose a threat to their rule.

国家元首是一位君主（通常是国王），他声称拥有神圣的统治权。中世纪的君主制概念认为, 国王会服从教皇，但"绝对君主"认为, 自己不服从任何人。他们可以按照自己的意愿进行统治，无需与他人协商, 或寻求他人的同意，也无需像中世纪君主那样与贵族阶级分享权力。 +
绝对君主宣布自己的法律，制定外交政策，执行司法（或任命司法人员），并按照自己的意愿征收税收。他们是自己土地上的唯一权威来源，经常采取措施削弱贵族的权力，以免贵族对其统治构成威胁。(就如同中国皇帝一样)

|-> 君主供养军队, 而非封臣
|They were guarded by professional standing armies, not noble vassals at the head of their own private armies.

他们由专业的常备军守卫，而不是由"贵族封臣"率领自己的私人军队。

=== (法国) 君主集权

The most powerful of the absolute monarchies was France, and Louis XIV, who became king of France in 1643, was the epitome of a divine-right monarch.

君主专制国家中最强大的是法国，1643年成为法国国王的路易十四, 就是"君权神授"的典型。

|-> 剥夺贵族权力
|Unwilling to share power with the higherranked members of the French nobility, who had been responsible for numerous revolts against the French monarchy in the decades before he came to the throne, Louis deprived them of any role in governing or administering the state.

He required that they live with him at his magnificent palace in Versailles, where they were invited to spend their time and money (which might otherwise have been used to plot revolts) in putting on displays of ostentatious living and competing with one another for the king’s favor.

路易不愿与法国贵族中的高级成员分享权力，在他登基之前的几十年里，这些贵族曾多次发动反对法国君主制的叛乱，路易剥夺了他们在治理或管理国家方面的任何作用。

他要求他们和他一起住在他位于凡尔赛的宏伟宫殿里，在那里他们被邀请花时间和金钱（否则这些钱可能会被用来策划叛乱）展示奢华的生活，并相互竞争以获得国王的恩惠。

|-> 集各权于一身
|All state matters were rigorously scrutinized by Louis, and he promulgated legal codes for France’s colonies. “L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state”), he once famously proclaimed.

所有国家事务都受到路易的严格审查，并且他为法国殖民地颁布法律法规。他曾经说过一句著名的话：“ L’état, c’est moi ”（“朕即国家”）。

== ★ #Mercantilism 重商主义#

===  "重商主义"理论

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, mercantilist theory was embraced by most European nations, especially France and England. Perhaps as much as religious fervor and a thirst for knowledge, this premise drove exploration and the establishment of colonies.


十六、十七世纪，一种"重商主义"经济理论, 被大多数欧洲国家，特别是法国和英国所接受。也许与"宗教热情"和"对知识的渴望"一样，这一前提推动了"探索和殖民地的建立"。

"重商主义"的理论认为:
[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 一个国家**金银越多, 越好**
| A nation’s power depended on the amount of gold and silver it held. The world’s wealth as measured in gold and silver was finite, so a gain for one nation was a loss for another. According to mercantilism, there could be only one victor in economic competition.

一个国家的实力, 取决于它所拥有的金银数量。而以黄金和白银衡量的世界财富, 是有限的，因此一个国家的收益, 就是另一个国家的损失(即"零和博弈")。根据"重商主义"(的这个逻辑)，经济竞争中就只能有一个胜利者。

Because mercantilist theory saw economic gain for one nation as necessarily a loss for others, European nations engaged in trade wars as each tried to use tariffs to bar others from its markets.  +
At times, real wars accompanied trade wars. England and the Netherlands fought four wars over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, partially to gain control of transatlantic trade. England also fought France for access to the markets of India.

*由于重商主义理论认为一个国家的经济收益必然会导致其他国家的损失 (认为是"零和博弈". 因为现代经济学, 在那时还未诞生)，因此欧洲国家卷入了"贸易战"，每个国家都试图利用关税来阻止其他国家进入其市场。* +
有时，真正的战争伴随着贸易战。英国和荷兰在 17 世纪和 18 世纪期间进行了四次战争，部分原因是为了控制"跨大西洋贸易"。英国还与法国争夺"印度市场"的准入权。



|-> 如果积累金银? *保持"贸易顺差"*, 多卖货给他国, 少买入国外货
|Amassing national wealth depended on maintaining a favorable balance of trade, a situation in which a country exports goods of greater value than it imports.  Indeed, the ideal was to import nothing and produce everything in the home country, including agricultural produce.

国家要积累(金银)财富, 就取决于维持"贸易顺差"，即一个国家"出口额大于进口额"的情况。事实上，理想的状态是不进口任何东西，并在本国生产一切，包括农产品。

|-> 本国如何赚钱? 多卖给国外, 少卖给国内消费者
|It elevated the interests of merchants and manufacturers over those of workers and consumers by arguing that wages should be kept low. More money would thus remain in employers’ hands, and people would be discouraged (or prevented) from buying luxury goods that could instead be exported for profit.

它主张应保持低工资，从而使 商人和制造商的利益高于工人和消费者的利益。因此，更多的钱将留在雇主手中，人们将被阻止（或阻止）购买奢侈品，而这些奢侈品可以出口以获取利润。

|-> 殖民地是必要的, 因为**殖民地可以为母国提供原材料.** 然后**母国生产的产品, 可以卖给殖民地人民**.(这就是对殖民地的剥削了)
|A colonial empire was necessary for economic domination. Colonies could supply raw materials for domestic consumption, so there was no need to purchase these resources from others. Colonial populations, in turn, provided a ready market for goods made in the home country.

To ensure that colonies added to their national wealth, European countries that established them usually required that they trade only with the home country. Thus, for example, England’s colonies in North America could sell what they produced only in England.



殖民帝国对于经济统治是必要的。"殖民地"可以为国内消费, 提供原材料，因此没有必要从其他国家购买这些资源。反过来，殖民地人口, 为本国制造的商品提供了现成的(消费)市场。 +
因此, 为了确保殖民地增加其母国的财富，建立殖民地的欧洲国家, 通常要求它们只能与母国进行贸易。例如，在英属北美殖民地, 只能销售"产出地是英国"的商品。(意思就是北美人民, 只能购买英国货)

The perceived need to extract raw materials from colonies to benefit the home country’s interests often led governments to restrict colonies’ economic growth.

人们认为需要从殖民地获取原材料以造福母国的利益，这往往导致政府限制殖民地的经济增长


|-> 政府应该**监管商业**
|
Most mercantilist theorists believed government regulation of the economy was necessary to maximize wealth.

- Governments commonly prohibited certain imports to prevent them from competing with domestic industry. In 1539, for example, to protect domestic textile manufacturing, France banned the import of goods made of wool.

- Governments also imposed high tariffs, or taxes on imported goods. These made foreign products more expensive and thus promoted development of a nation’s own industries.

- Governments might also grant firms monopolies over certain kinds of domestic production, establish and provide financial support for certain industries to ensure domestic self-sufficiency, and pay for internal improvements, such as new roads, to promote domestic manufacturing and commerce.

- They also maintained large navies to protect international trade and defend foreign colonies.

大多数重商主义理论家认为，为了实现财富最大化，"政府对经济的监管"是必要的。

- 政府通常**禁止某些进口**，以防止它们与国内工业竞争。例如，1539年，为了保护国内纺织制造业，法国禁止进口羊毛制品。
- 政府还对进口商品, *征收高额关税*。来使外国产品变得更加昂贵，从而促进了本国工业的发展。
- 政府还可以授予企业对某些国内生产的**垄断权**，为某些行业建立并提供财政支持, 以**确保国内自给自足**，并支付内部改进费用，例如修建新道路，以促进国内制造业和商业。
- 他们还拥有庞大的海军来 保护国际贸易和**保卫海外殖民地**。

=== 对"重商主义"的批评

Mercantilism also had many critics. Many Europeans argued that the assumptions underlying mercantilist theory were flawed, and that putting it into practice was often harmful.

但"重商主义"也受到了许多批评。许多欧洲人认为，重商主义理论的假设是有缺陷的，将其付诸实践往往是有害的。

|-> *一国金银越多, ①会导致物价上涨, ②通胀, 即物以稀为贵, 金银越多, 金银本身的价格就越低.*
|Eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that as more gold circulated in a country’s economy, prices would rise, eventually becoming so high that no one would purchase goods. If abundance reduced the value of an item, then the more gold and silver a nation acquired, the less valuable it would be.

18世纪的苏格兰哲学家大卫·休谟提出，随着更多的黄金在一个国家的经济中流通，物价会上涨，最终高到没有人会购买商品的程度。如果数量的丰裕性, 会降低该物品的价值(正所谓物以稀为贵)，那么一个国家获取的黄金和白银越多，这些金银就越没有价值。

[.my1]
.案例
====
"If abundance reduced the value of an item" 这句话中的 "abundance" 指的是物品（包括金银或商品）的过剩。具体来说，这里指的是 金银的过剩。大卫·休谟在讨论经济时认为，当金银大量流通时，其相对价值会下降，因为它们的稀缺性减少了。换句话说，金银越多，它们的购买力就越低，这也是为什么他说 "the more gold and silver a nation acquired, the less valuable it would be"。
====

|-> 世界各国的经济贸易, 并非零和博弈
|The eighteenth-century philosopher and economist Adam Smith, also a Scot, criticized mercantilism as well. Smith argued that economic gain for one nation did not mean economic loss for others. Rather, trade could be mutually beneficial for all. It made little sense for a nation to produce everything it needed.

十八世纪哲学家和经济学家、苏格兰人亚当·斯密也批评"重商主义"。亚当·斯密认为，一国的经济收益并不意味着其他国家的经济损失。相反，贸易可以对所有人都有利。一个国家生产其所需的一切是没有意义的 (比较优势)。

|-> 政府放松监管, 有利于经济发展
|Smith also opposed government regulation of the economy. In his view, competition among the producers of goods and the influence of the market (that is, the desires of buyers and sellers) made for a healthy economy.

亚当·斯密还反对政府对经济的监管。在他看来，商品生产者之间的竞争和市场的影响（即买家和卖家的欲望） 有利于经济的健康发展。

== 各国的重商主义


=== (法国) 重商主义

France was an absolute monarchy. France provides perhaps the preeminent example of the mercantilist theory in practice.

法国是一个"绝对君主制"国家. 法国也许是"重商主义"理论在实践中的杰出范例。

In 1627, the French government granted a monopoly over the fur trade to the Company of New France. All fur trappers in Canada were to either work directly for the company or sell their furs to it. Traders had to pay the government a 25 percent sales tax. In 1663, Louis XIV placed the company under royal control.

1627年，法国政府将(它加大拿殖民地)毛皮贸易的垄断权, 授予"新法兰西公司"。加拿大的所有毛皮捕猎者, 要么直接为该公司工作，要么将其毛皮出售给该公司。贸易商必须向政府缴纳 25% 的销售税。 1663 年，路易十四将公司置于皇家控制之下。

|-> 征收关税
|Although England’s Parliament did not exert as much control over its economy as the monarchy exerted in France, it nevertheless took steps to promote English trade and discourage the importation of foreign goods. Tariffs were placed on foreign products, and in the second half of the seventeenth century, laws were passed requiring that all ships bringing goods to England have English owners and a predominantly English crew.

尽管英国议会对其经济的控制程度, 不如法国君主制，但它仍然采取措施促进英国贸易, 并阻止对外国商品的进口。英国对外国产品征收关税，并在十七世纪下半叶通过了法律，要求所有向英国运送货物的船只, 都必须由"英国船主"和以"英国人为主的船员"组成。

|-> *为了防止本国商人恶性竞争, 而导致价格战内卷, 就将对外贸易权力, 赐予唯一的公司, 另其垄断.*
|Like France, both England and the Netherlands granted monopolies on foreign trade to private companies—the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. The purpose was to prevent competition among merchants that might drive up the prices they were willing to pay for foreign goods and drive down the prices they charged for domestic goods sold abroad.

与法国一样，英国和荷兰都将**对外贸易垄断权, 授予私营公司**—— 分别是英国东印度公司, 和荷兰东印度公司。 **目的是防止商人之间的竞争，因为这种竞争, 可能会抬高他们愿意为外国商品支付的价格，并压低他们在国外销售的国内商品的价格。**

|-> 建立殖民地, 以获取原材料

=== (荷兰) 重商主义

The Dutch adopted the mercantilist strategy of exporting high-quality goods to make up for the money the resource-poor country spent on raw materials supplied by other nations.

荷兰采取了重商主义战略，出口优质商品，以弥补这个资源贫乏国家"从其他国家进口原材料"的钱。


'''


=== (西班牙) 重商主义

Spain exercised the strictest control over colonial commerce. Trade was limited to only a few ports in the Spanish colonies and the port of Seville in Spain. In addition, those seeking to engage in trade had to procure a license to do so, at considerable expense.

西班牙对殖民地商业实行最严格的控制。贸易仅限于西班牙殖民地的几个港口 (*相当于海关作用, 只允许从我定下的出口走, 防止走私, 防止逃税, 防止殖民地的原材料流入其他国家中*), 和西班牙的塞维利亚港. 此外，那些寻求从事贸易的人, 必须花费相当大的费用, 才能获得许可证。

To increase their access to raw materials and establish new markets for their goods, the Dutch, English, and French, noting the success of Spain and Portugal, also set out to establish colonies in the Americas. A colonial empire seemed essential to securing national wealth and power.

为了增加"获得原材料"的机会, 并为其商品建立新的市场，荷兰人、英国人和法国人, 在注意到西班牙和葡萄牙的成功之后，也开始在美洲建立殖民地。殖民帝国似乎对于确保国家财富和权力至关重要。

|(17世纪) 加勒比海岛屿 情况
|Although the mainland colonies yielded wealth for the European home countries, the chief prizes were the islands of the Caribbean where sugar could be grown.

Over the course of the seventeenth century, England, France, and the Netherlands set up colonies throughout the Caribbean on islands either not claimed by Spain or taken from it.

尽管大陆殖民地为欧洲母国带来了财富，但最主要的收获, 是可以种植糖的加勒比海岛屿。

在十七世纪，英国、法国和荷兰, 在整个加勒比海地区的岛屿上建立了殖民地，这些岛屿要么未被西班牙声称拥有主权，要么是从西班牙处夺取。

|The three attempted to found colonies in Central or South America as well, but Spanish and Portuguese dominance there either made these efforts unsuccessful, like the Dutch attempts in Brazil, or they kept the colonies small, such as French Guiana and Dutch Guiana, now Suriname.

这三国(英国、法国, 荷兰)也试图在中美洲或南美洲建立殖民地，但西班牙和葡萄牙在那里的统治, 要么使这些努力失败，就像荷兰在巴西的尝试，要么他们只能保持较小的殖民地，例如"法属圭亚那", 和"荷属圭亚那"，现在的苏里南。

== 殖民地的移民

=== 契约仆人

The colonies attracted many landless, unemployed young European men and women, too, who traveled to North America as indentured servants, bound by a contract to work for an agreed-upon number of years. After the landowner who paid for their passage had been compensated by their years of labor, indentured servants received their freedom and typically a grant of land as well.

这些殖民地也吸引了许多无地、失业的欧洲青年男女，他们以"契约仆人"的身份前往北美，并受合同约束，在约定的年限内工作。土地所有者会为"契约仆人"支付旅费, 后者则通过通过多年的劳动来补偿前者, 之后，契约仆人就能获得自由，通常还能获得土地。

In 1535, Jacques Cartier claimed Canada, also called New France, in the name of King Francis I.

1535年，雅克·卡地亚以国王弗朗西斯一世的名义, 宣称拥有加拿大，也称为"新法兰西"。

Like England, France was unable to maintain a permanent settlement in North America until the seventeenth century, when Samuel de Champlain founded one at Quebec.

与英国一样，法国直到十七世纪, 才在北美建立永久定居点，当时"萨缪尔·德·尚普兰"在魁北克建立了一个永久定居点。

=== 殖民地 (英国)




England established colonies on the mainland of North America in the sixteenth century, and by the middle of the eighteenth century, they stretched from Newfoundland to Georgia.

英国于十六世纪在北美大陆建立殖民地，到十八世纪中叶，殖民地从纽芬兰延伸到乔治亚州.

=== 殖民地 (荷兰)

Like the French, the Dutch colonists of New Netherlands were primarily engaged in the fur trade, although many Dutch farmers also settled in the Hudson Valley, in New Jersey, and on Long Island.

与法国人一样，"新荷兰"的荷兰殖民者, 主要从事毛皮贸易，尽管许多荷兰农民也定居在哈德逊河谷、新泽西州和长岛。
