== 政治体制


Mehmed regarded himself not as a usurper but as the rightful successor to the Byzantines. He declared himself Caesar, the heir to the old Roman imperial throne. He appointed a new leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Gennadius II, who in turn recognized Mehmed’s claim as the legitimate heir of the last Byzantine emperor. The last emperor’s actual heirs, his nephews, were taken into Mehmed’s service and occupied important administrative positions in the empire.

(占领东罗马帝国后,) 穆罕默德并不认为自己是篡位者，而是拜占庭人的合法继承人。他宣称自己是凯撒，是旧罗马帝国王 位的继承人。他任命了东正教的新领袖根纳迪乌斯二世，后者又承认穆罕默德是拜占庭末代皇帝的合 法继承人。最后一位皇帝的实际继承人，即他的侄子，被纳入穆罕默德的手下，并在帝国中担任重要 的行政职务。(这就是用前朝统治者的子孙, 来安抚前朝人心)

He issued kanun, laws made by the sultan, as opposed to sharia (religious law) interpreted by Islamic judges, and compiled them in the Kanun-name (“Book of the Law”). Kanun dealt with issues that sharia often did not address, such as taxation or punishment for certain crimes.

他颁布了由苏丹制定的卡努(kanun)法律，与由伊斯兰法官解释的伊斯兰教法(sharia)相反，并以卡努(kanun)的名义编纂了这些法律。卡努处理了伊斯兰教法通常没有涉及的问题，比如税收或对某些罪行的惩罚。

== 经济上

the Ottomans gained control of part of the Silk Roads. The Ottomans commanded Red Sea ports in Egypt after defeating the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517, which gave them additional control over the spice trade. The Ottomans also dominated trade on the Black Sea. The exclusion of Italian merchants from their traditional trade routes, the heavy taxes imposed on goods that traveled overland, many Europeans’ dislike for transacting business with Muslims, and the expense of overland trade led western Europeans to seek all-water oceanic routes to South and East Asia.

奥斯曼人控制了部 分丝绸之路，并在 1517 年击 败马穆鲁克苏丹国后还控制了埃及的红海港口, 这使他们对香料贸易有了更多的控制权。。奥斯曼人还主导了黑海的贸易。意大利商 人被排除在传统贸易路线之外，对陆路货物征收重税，许多欧洲人不喜欢与穆斯林做生意，以及陆路 贸易的费用，导致西欧人寻求通往南半球和南半球的全水路海洋路线。东亚。

== 宗教上

He ordered that the Byzantine cathedral of Hagia Sophia be left intact and converted into a mosque. He also ordered a new mosque, the Fatih Mosque (“Conqueror’s Mosque”), to be built in the city.

(穆罕默德占领君士坦丁堡后,) 他下令将拜占庭式的圣索菲 亚大教堂完好无损地保留下来，改建为清真寺。他还下令在城内建造一座新清真寺，即法提赫清真寺（“征服者清真寺”）

As earlier Ottoman rulers had done, Mehmed allowed Christians and Jews in his lands to worship as they pleased. This arrangement was an early appearance of the Ottoman millet system, in which religious communities were allowed a substantial degree of autonomy and were governed by their own leaders and their own law codes.

正如早期的奥斯曼统治者 所做的那样，穆罕默德允许基督徒和犹太人在他的土地上按照自己的意愿进行礼拜。这种安排是奥斯 曼帝国米利特制度的早期出现，其中宗教团体被允许高度自治，并由自己的领导人和自己的法典管 辖。

The areas west of the Volga River, populated largely by Orthodox Christians, were the only ones that did not see the majority convert to Islam, and they remain so to this day.

伏尔加河以 西的地区主要是东正教基督徒，是唯一没有看到大多数人皈依伊斯兰教的地区，直到今天仍然如此。

=== 灭亡东罗马帝国



As the people of western Europe remade their societies following the collapse of the western half of the Roman Empire, the Byzantines in the east preserved Roman cultural practices for centuries, seeing themselves always as the continuation of a proud and strong Mediterranean empire. By the eleventh century, however, the Byzantines found their power challenged by the arrival of Turkic tribes such as the Seljuks, who settled in the eastern half of their domains and gradually wrested control of the area from them.

As different Turkic tribes arrived and settled in the region, one group, the Ottomans, soon rose to prominence over others. The Ottomans were Turkic-speaking pastoralists. The Ottomans eventually deprive the Byzantines of their last remnants of power.


罗马帝国西半部崩溃后，西欧人民重建了他们的社会，而东部的拜占庭人几个世纪以来一直保留着罗 马文化习俗，始终将自己视为骄傲而强大的地中海帝国的延续。然而，到了十一世纪，拜占庭人发现 他们的权力受到塞尔柱人(后建立奥斯曼帝国)等突厥部落的到来的挑战. 塞尔柱人定居在拜占庭领土的东半部，并逐渐从 拜占庭手中夺取了对该地区的控制权。

随着不同的突厥部落抵达并定居在该地区，奥斯曼帝国这一部 落很快就在其他部落中脱颖而出。奥斯曼人是讲突厥语的牧民. 奥斯曼人最终剥夺了拜占庭人最后的残余权力。

The Byzantine emperor Manuel II had assisted Mehmed’s rivals for the Ottoman throne, attempting to keep the Ottomans weak by prolonging the civil war.

拜占庭皇帝曼努埃尔二世曾协助穆罕默德的竞争对手争夺奥斯曼帝国的王位，试图通过延 长内战来削弱奥斯曼帝国。

The Byzantines were also close allies of the Venetians and Genoese, who controlled trade in the Aegean and the Black Seas and whose ships could interfere with Ottoman efforts to control both sides of the Dardanelles.

拜占庭人也是威尼斯人和热那亚人的亲密盟友，他们控制着爱琴海和黑海 的贸易，他们的船只可以干扰奥斯曼帝国控制达达尼尔海峡两岸的努力。

At Constantinople’s height, somewhere between 500,000 and one million people had lived within its walls, but the bubonic plague and Ottoman sieges had reduced the number to perhaps fifty thousand. Nevertheless, so long as Constantinople stood on the western shore of the Bosporus controlling access to the Black Sea, the Ottomans could not rest easy in their domains.

君士坦丁 堡在鼎盛时期，大约有 50 万到 100 万人居住在城墙内， 但黑死病和奥斯曼帝国的围攻使这一数字减少到大约 5 万人。然而，只要君士坦丁堡仍然屹立在博斯 普鲁斯海峡西岸，控制着黑海的出海口，奥斯曼人就无法在自己的领土上高枕无忧。

On the morning of May 29, 1453, after a siege of fifty-seven days, the Ottoman guns breached the walls. The last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaeologus, died fighting for his city. The city fell to the Ottomans.

The fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 sent many Greek scholars and theologians fleeing to the city-states of Italy.


1453年5月29日早晨，经过五十七天的围困，奥斯曼大炮冲破城墙，括最后一位拜占庭皇帝君士坦丁十一世帕拉奥洛古斯，他为自己的城市 而战而死。这座城市落入了奥斯曼 帝国之手。 +
