Whereas the American Revolutionary War resulted in the birth of an independent new nation, the French Revolution radically restructured long-standing political systems and reshaped the balance of power in Europe.

Although the revolt’s radical rejection of authoritarian rule, which enforced obedience to government authority and limited individual freedom, ultimately faltered, the social and political reforms it inspired heavily influenced the character of modern nations.

美国独立战争, 导致了一个独立新国家的诞生，而法国大革命, 则彻底重组了长期存在的政治体系，并重塑了欧洲的"势力均衡". 尽管这场革命对"专制统治"的激进反抗最, 终未能成功 (即这场革命最终未能彻底推翻专制统治)，而专制统治要求人们服从政府权威, 并限制个人自由，但它所激发的社会和政治改革, 却极大地影响了现代国家的特征。






As a means of reducing monarchical power and enforcing the mandates of the Declaration, the National Assembly created a new constitution in 1791 and charged a newly formed Legislative Assembly with governing France as a constitutional monarchy and developing legislative reform.



作为削弱君主权力, 和执行《宣言》的一种手段，国民议会于 1791 年制定了新宪法，并责成新成立的"立法议会", 作为"君主立宪制国家"来管理法国，并发展"立法改革"。

Despite its progressive reforms, the Declaration faced opposition from critics for failing to address women’s rights. In fact, France was the last of the major Western powers to extend voting rights to women, in 1944.

尽管进行了渐进式改革，《宣言》仍因未能解决妇女权利问题, 而遭到批评者的反对。事实上，法国是最后一个向女性授予投票权的西方大国, 在1944 年。

The newly formed Legislative Assembly suspended the king and created a representative body known as the National Convention, which convicted Louis of treason. The National Convention was composed of a number of different groups of revolutionaries with conflicting opinions regarding what the government of France and French society should be like. A variety of political clubs and organizations expressed a range of ideas about the goals of the revolution and the best course of action to achieve them. Founded in 1789, the Jacobins quickly became the most influential of these clubs. The Jacobins sought to end the reign of King Louis XVI and establish a republic to replace the French monarchy. However, disagreements between their radical and moderate factions made consensus difficult to achieve. Whereas the Girondins, a moderate faction of the Jacobins, some of whom hailed from the Gironde region of southwestern France, opposed executing the king, the radical Jacobin faction the Mountain, so named because its members sat on the highest benches of the National Convention, supported sentencing him to death. After the Convention held a trial for the king, the Mountain ultimately prevailed, and the king was executed in January 1793.

新成立的立法议会, 暂停了国王的职务，并成立了一个名为"国民大会"的代表机构，该机构判定路易犯有叛国罪。"国民大会"由许多不同的革命者团体组成，他们对法国政府和法国社会应该是什么样子, 持有不同的意见。各种政治俱乐部和组织, 表达了关于"革命目标"和"实现这些目标的最佳行动方案"的一系列想法。雅各宾派成立于 1789 年，很快成为这些俱乐部中最有影响力的。雅各宾派试图结束国王路易十六的统治, 并建立一个"共和国"来取代法国"君主制"。然而，激进派和温和派之间的分歧, 使得共识难以达成。 鉴于"吉伦特派"是"雅各宾派"中的一个温和派别，其中一些人来自法国西南部的吉伦特地区，反对处决国 王，而激进的雅各宾派“山地派”则因其成员坐在国民公会的最高席位而得名，支持判处他死刑。公会对 国王进行审判后，山岳派最终获胜，国王于 1793 年 1 月被处决。

After declaring those who opposed the king’s execution enemies of the revolution, in 1793 the Mountain and their supporters initiated a period of violent repression known as the Reign of Terror. Maximilien de Robespierre, a lawyer who championed the principles of equality, led the provisional government of France, known as the Committee of Public Safety, from 1793 to 1794. Under the battle cry liberté, égalité, fraternité (liberty, equality, brotherhood), this radical phase of the revolution achieved many progressive reforms, including controlling the price of grain, legalizing divorce, and abolishing slavery. Despite such achievements, however, it was also inherently contradictory, since tens of thousands of people were arbitrarily imprisoned or executed as a means of silencing dissent.

在宣布那些反对处决国王的人为革命敌人后，山岳党及其支持者于 1793 年发起了一段被称为“恐怖统 治”的暴力镇压时期。马克西米连·德·罗伯斯庇尔是一位倡导平等原则的律师，从 1793 年到 1794 年领 导了法国临时政府，即公共安全委员会。在自由、平等、博爱（自由、平等、兄弟情谊）的战斗口号 下，革命的这一激进阶段实现了许多进步的改革，包括控制粮食价格、离婚合法化和废除奴隶制。然 而，尽管取得了这些成就，但它本质上也是矛盾的，因为成千上万的人被任意监禁或处决，作为压制 异议的手段。

Disagreements between the Committee of Public Safety and the Convention over religious and economic policies hastened the end of the Reign of Terror as support for Robespierre’s repressive policies dwindled. By 1794, members of the opposition had removed Robespierre from power, and the Terror finally came to an end in July 1794 when its leaders, including Robespierre, were executed on the guillotine. The Convention then dismantled the executive powers of the Committee of Public Safety and sought to restore political stability by creating a constitution in 1795 that established a new executive council of five men known as the Directory. Despite the new government’s efforts to prevent rebellions and dissent, it faced a variety of challenges from radical Jacobins who wanted to restore the Terror’s revolutionary fervor and from conservative factions that sought to restore the monarchy. Growing conflict between moderates and radicals, sharpened by a period of famine and economic difficulty, ultimately led the Directory to invite Napoléon Bonaparte, a charismatic and ruthless general in the French army, to help them develop a more authoritative government in 1799 and quiet the voices of opposition.

随着对罗伯斯庇尔镇压政策的支持减少，公共安全委员会和公约之间在宗教和经济政策上的分歧加速 了恐怖统治的结束。到 1794 年，反对派成员推翻了罗伯斯庇尔的权力，恐怖统治终于在 1794 年 7 月 结束，包括罗伯斯庇尔在内的反对派领导人被送上了断头台。随后，国民公会废除了公共安全委员会 的行政权力，并于 1795 年制定了一部宪法，设立了一个新的五人执行委员会，称为“督政府” ，以寻求 恢复政治稳定。尽管新政府努力防止叛乱和异见，但它仍然面临着来自想要恢复恐怖革命热情的激进 雅各宾派和寻求恢复君主制的保守派系的各种挑战。温和派和激进派之间的冲突日益加剧，加上一段 时期的饥荒和经济困难，最终导致督政府邀请拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoléon Bonaparte）这位法国军队中 一位魅力超凡、冷酷无情的将军，帮助他们在 1799 年建立一个更具权威的政府，平息喧嚣。的反对 派。

Following the Terror’s failure, the revolution took a more conservative turn, and the idealism of the French Revolution came to an end. The modern democratic tradition emerging in France then transformed into popular authoritarianism when Napoléon seized control. Although he safeguarded some revolutionary gains, Napoléon also reinstated slavery in France’s colonies and declared himself emperor in 1804.

恐怖失败后，革命转向更加保守的方向，法国大革命的理想主义结束了。当拿破仑掌权后，法国兴起 的现代民主传统转变为大众独裁主义。尽管拿破仑捍卫了一些革命成果，但他也在法国殖民地恢复了 奴隶制，并于 1804 年宣布自己为皇帝。

Following a series of failed military campaigns stemming from his desire to dominate Europe, however, including a disastrous attempted invasion of Russia, Napoléon abdicated his throne in 1814. He then returned and led France again until his defeat by the British and Prussians at Waterloo (Belgium) in 1815.

然而，出于统治欧洲的愿望，拿破仑发动了一系列失败的军事行动，包括灾难性地入侵俄罗斯，最终 于 1814 年退位。然后他返回并再次领导法国，直到在滑铁卢被英国和普鲁士击败。 1815 年，比利 时）。

The French Revolution now appeared to come full circle with the restoration of the French monarchy in 1814–1815. However, Louis XVIII, the restored French king, could not rule as an absolute monarch and had to recognize his subjects’ new constitutional rights to participate in government and regulate the king’s power. Notwithstanding Napoléon’s brief autocratic reign, the French Revolution successfully dismantled the nobility’s and clergy’s disproportionate share of power and defeated the strongest absolute monarchy in Europe.

随着 1814 年至 1815 年法国君主制的复辟，法国大革命似乎又回到了原点。然而，复辟的法国国王路 易十八无法以绝对君主的身份进行统治，必须承认其臣民参与政府和规范国王权力的新宪法权利。尽 管拿破仑有短暂的独裁统治，但法国大革命成功地废除了贵族和神职人员过多的权力，并击败了欧洲 最强大的绝对君主制。

Perhaps even more paradoxical was the contradiction between Enlightenment ideals of liberty that fueled the revolution on one hand and France’s ongoing colonialism, exploitation of slave labor, and discrimination against free people of color on the other. Except for a brief period during the Reign of Terror, France continued to uphold the institution of slavery in its colonies. Ultimately, then, the legacy of revolution in France was mixed.

也许更自相矛盾的是，一方面推动了革命的启蒙自由理想与另一方面法国持续的殖民主义、对奴隶劳 动的剥削以及对自由有色人种的歧视之间的矛盾。除了恐怖统治时期的短暂时期外，法国继续在其殖 民地维持奴隶制。。最终，法国革命的遗产是好坏参半的。

In the early nineteenth century, the upheaval of revolution gave way to political philosophies and ideologies intended to restore order and prevent the types of violent clashes that had defined much of the previous century. As belief in popular sovereignty and principles of liberty and equality spread, particularly in Europe and North America, emerging nations came to hold different ideas about the best way to safeguard these revolutionary gains. In particular, nationalism, liberalism, and conservatism became entrenched forces that, while unique, all temporarily subdued the unrest of the revolutionary period. In a radically transformed political landscape, however, revolts and revolutions eventually emerged that challenged the last remnants of the prerevolutionary status quo.

十九世纪初，革命的剧变让位于旨在恢复秩序并防止上世纪大部分时间出现的暴力冲突的政治哲学和 意识形态。随着对人民主权以及自由和平等原则的信仰的传播，特别是在欧洲和北美，新兴国家开始 对捍卫这些革命成果的最佳方式持有不同的想法。特别是，民族主义、自由主义和保守主义成为根深 蒂固的力量，虽然独特，但都暂时平息了革命时期的动荡。然而，在彻底改变的政治格局中，叛乱和 革命最终出现，挑战了革命前的现状的最后残余。

Nationalism

民族主义

A radical political ideology that promotes the interests of the nation over international concerns, nationalism advocates the uniqueness and inherent superiority of an individual’s own country and the right to self-determination and political autonomy. It can also generate hostility toward outsiders and marginalize minority communities.

民族主义是一种将国家利益置于国际问题之上的激进政治意识形态，主张个人国家的独特性和固有优 越性以及自决权和政治自治权。但 它也可能产生对外来者的敌意并使少数群体边缘化

At times, though, people who share a national identity (or “nationality”) may be scattered across a variety of different states. For example, in Europe in the nineteenth century, people who were ethnically German and spoke the German language lived in many different kingdoms, principalities, and other political units. In such a case, nationalists seek to unify all those with the same national identity in the same state, so that all live under the same government, which members of that nationality control, within the same territorial borders.

但有时，拥有相同国家身份（或“国籍”）的人可能分散在各个不同的州。例如，在十九世纪的欧洲，德 意志民族和说德语的人生活在许多不同的王国、公国和其他政治单位。在这种情况下，民族主义者寻 求将所有具有相同民族身份的人统一在同一个国家，以便所有人都生活在同一个政府之下，由该民族 成员控制，在同一个领土边界内。

At other times, people who share a national identity may live in a state governed by people of a different nationality. Jews, for example, share a Jewish identity but, except for those who live in Israel (a state that was founded only in 1948), Jews live in states dominated by people of other nationalities. In such cases, nationalists may advocate that a separate state be formed by members of the minority nationality, so that they may live and govern themselves without the interference of other, sometimes hostile, groups. In the nineteenth century, a Jewish movement called Zionism formed to advocate for the establishment of a separate state for Jews.

在其他时候，具有同一民族身份的人可能生活在由不同国籍的人统治的国家中。例如，犹太人拥有犹 太人的身份，但除了居住在以色列（1948 年才成立的国家）的犹太人外，犹太人生活在由其他民族的 人统治的国家中。在这种情况下，民族主义者可能会主张由少数民族成员组建一个独立的国家，以便 他们可以在不受其他有时是敌对群体的干扰的情况下生活和自治。十九世纪，犹太复国主义运动兴 起，主张为犹太人建立一个独立的国家。

This sense of shared identity and heritage laid the groundwork for the nationalism that ultimately led to the unification of Italy and of Germany over the course of the nineteenth century.

这种共同的身份和遗产感为民族主义奠定 了基础，最终导致了意大利和德国在十九世纪的统一。

In the first half of the nineteenth century, Italy was a loose coalition of states under the control of the Austrian Empire and the Catholic Church.

十九世纪上半叶，意大利是奥地利帝国和天主教会控制下的松散国家联盟。

In predominantly German-speaking lands, an alliance of thirty-nine sovereign states known as the Germanic Confederation emerged as a replacement for the former Holy Roman Empire in 1815. Because each of the member states retained political autonomy, the Germanic Confederation lacked executive power or centralized authority. The main goal of the Confederation, however, was not to replace the governmental powers of its member states but rather to create a unified defense against France and Russia. Although it eventually succumbed to the Austrian Empire in 1866, the Confederation laid the groundwork for the nationalism that inspired German unification in 1871 and the creation of the modern nation-state of Germany.

1815 年，在以德语为主的地区，由 39 个主权国家组成的联盟（称为日耳曼联邦）出现，取代了前神 圣罗马帝国。由于每个成员国都保留政治自治权，日耳曼联邦缺乏行政权力或权力。中央集权。然 而，联邦的主要目标不是取代其成员国的政府权力，而是建立一个针对法国和俄罗斯的统一防御体 系。尽管联邦最终于 1866 年屈服于奥地利帝国，但它为激发 1871 年德国统一和现代民族国家德国创 建的民族主义奠定了基础。

Bismarck’s efforts culminated in the formation of a unified Germany, and on January 18, 1871, he was appointed Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire.

俾斯麦的努力最终促成了统一德国的形成，并于1871年1月18日被任命为德意志帝国总理 。

Germany Unified. This map depicts the unified German nation in 1871 and the patchwork of previously autonomous states that merged under the principles of nationalism to form a single country.

Unlike nationalism, patriotism does not entail asserting the superiority of one nation over others.

与民族主义不同，爱国主义并不意味着主张一个国家相对于其他国家的优越性。

Liberalism

自由主义

Like nationalism, the political philosophy of liberalism is rooted in Enlightenment principles and born of the revolutionary struggles of the eighteenth century. Its underlying goal is freedom from restraint, more specifically freedom of expression, popular sovereignty, representative government, and the protection of private property and civil rights. The liberalism of the nineteenth century is different from the liberalism of the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however. The meaning of the term has changed over time, and, although people who are regarded as liberals in the twentyfirst century United States generally advocate for government assistance for the poor and government intervention to ensure equality, nineteenth-century liberals opposed government intervention. Liberalism and nationalism are not mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, a distinction between political and economic liberalism evolved from the work of Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke and Adam Smith.

与民族主义一样，自由主义的政治哲学植根于启蒙原则，诞生于十八世纪的革命斗争。其根本目标是 不受限制的自由，更具体地说是言论自由、人民主权、代议制政府以及保护私有财产和公民权利。然 而，十九世纪的自由主义与二十世纪末和二十一世纪的自由主义不同。这个词的含义随着时间的推移 而发生了变化，尽管在二十一世纪的美国被视为自由主义者的人普遍主张政府援助穷人和政府干预以 确保平等，但十九世纪的自由主义者反对政府干预。自由主义和民族主义并不相互排斥. 然而，政治自由主义和经济自由主义之间的 区别是从约翰·洛克和亚当·斯密等启蒙思想家的著作中演变而来的。

Based on Locke’s emphasis on the consent of the governed and the natural rights of life, liberty, and property, political liberalism promotes limited government and the right to oppose any political authority that does not carry the consent of the people. These goals can be ensured by imposing limits on government authority and guaranteeing rights to all citizens in a written constitution. Religious toleration and the separation of church and state also became fundamental principles of liberalism in the eighteenth century. All played a significant role in shaping revolutionary movements in Britain’s North American colonies, Haiti, and France, all of which issued written constitutions asserting the sovereignty of the people. Enlightenment ideas of natural rights—tested through a series of revolutions—developed into a lasting commitment to consent of the governed and equality before the law in the liberal political philosophies of the nineteenth century.

基于洛克强调被统治者的同意以及生命、自由和财产等自然权利，政治自由主义提倡有限政府和反对 任何未经人民同意的政治权威的权利。这些目标可以通过对政府权力施加限制并在成文宪法中保障所 有公民的权利来确保。宗教宽容和政教分离也成为十八世纪自由主义的基本原则。他们都在英国北美 殖民地、海地和法国的革命运动中发挥了重要作用，这些国家都颁布了成文宪法，维护人民的主权。 自然权利的启蒙思想经过一系列革命的考验，发展成为十九世纪自由政治哲学中对被统治者的同意和 法律面前人人平等的持久承诺。(西方在社会思想进步上，真是领先中国两三百年。中国的民权现在比人家18世纪还不如)

One of the most celebrated proponents of liberalism in the nineteenth century was the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, who argued for the protection of individual rights from censorship and tyranny. On Liberty, his classic treatise published in 1859, emphasized the importance of toleration and stressed that multiple ethical codes could coexist peacefully in a given society.

十九世纪最著名的自由主义支持者之一是英国哲学家约翰·斯图尔特·密尔(John Stuart Mill)，他主张保 护个人权利免受审查和暴政。他于 1859 年发表的经典著作《论自由》强调了宽容的重要性，并强调多 种道德准则可以在特定社会中和平共处。

Whereas Mill and Locke focused liberalism on principles of natural rights and equality, economic liberalism derived from the Enlightenment theories of Scottish economist Adam Smith. Smith, whose theories shaped the burgeoning capitalism of the era, argued for the principle of laissez-faire, the idea that economic affairs should be free of government interference.

穆勒和洛克将自由主义重点放在自然权利和平等原则上，而经济自由主义则源自苏格兰经济学家亚当· 斯密的启蒙理论。史密斯的理论塑造了那个时代蓬勃发展的资本主义，他主张自由放任原则，即经济 事务不应受到政府干预。

Conservatism

保守主义

Conservative theorists asserted that individual rights were secondary to the rights of the community, and that the only acceptable way to generate political change was slowly and gradually rather than through revolution.

保守派理论家声称，个人权利次于社 区权利，产生政治变革的唯一可接受的方式是缓慢而渐进，而不是通过革命。

The central goal of conservative leaders in early nineteenth-century Europe, like the Austrian foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, was to prevent future revolutions and maintain a favorable balance of power, an equilibrium that prevents one nation from dominating others. In response to the Napoleonic Wars, during which Napoléon sought to create a Grand Empire that expanded French power over much of the European continent at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Metternich and his allies sought to contain France and restore order by establishing conservative political regimes.

十九世纪初欧洲保守派领导人的核心目标，如奥地利外交部长克莱门斯·冯·梅特涅，是防止未来的革命 并维持有利的权力平衡，即防止一个国家 统治其他国家的平衡。十九世纪初，拿破仑试图建立一个大 帝国，将法国的权力扩展到欧洲大陆的大部分地区，为了应对拿破仑战争，梅特涅和他的盟友试图通 过建立保守的政治政权来遏制法国并恢复秩序。

Men from the upper classes of society who throw themselves into the tide of revolution are either those who disguise their ambition or perverse, lost souls in the widest meaning of these words.

(保守主义者 Klemens von Metternich 克莱门斯·冯·梅特涅 的话: )投身于革命浪潮的上层人士，要么是那些掩饰自己野心的人，要么是那些倒行逆施、迷 失灵魂的人。

To ensure that no single country could conquer others, they agreed to divide military and political power more equitably among themselves.

为了确保没有一个 国家能够征服其他国家，他们同意在彼此之间更公平地分配军事和政治权力。

In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, most European American colonies gained their independence.

。在十九世纪的前三十年，大多数欧洲美洲殖 民地获得了独立。

The hundred years after 1750 marked a profound restructuring of world power and a host of political and economic changes in the Atlantic world. The Revolutionary War (1776–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), and the Peninsular War (1808–1814) were watershed events that reverberated across South America on inspiring waves of revolutionary upheavals.

1750 年之后的百年标志着世界权力的深刻重组以及大西洋世界的一系列政治和经济变革。。独立战争（1776- 1783）、法国大革命（1789-1799）和半岛战争（1808-1814）是具有里程碑意义的事件，在整个南 美洲引起了革命动乱的浪潮。
