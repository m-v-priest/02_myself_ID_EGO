Whereas the American Revolutionary War resulted in the birth of an independent new nation, the French Revolution radically restructured long-standing political systems and reshaped the balance of power in Europe.

Although the revolt’s radical rejection of authoritarian rule, which enforced obedience to government authority and limited individual freedom, ultimately faltered, the social and political reforms it inspired heavily influenced the character of modern nations.

美国独立战争, 导致了一个独立新国家的诞生，而法国大革命, 则彻底重组了长期存在的政治体系，并重塑了欧洲的"势力均衡". 尽管这场"法国大革命"(1789.7.14 - 1794.7.27)对"专制统治"的激进反抗最, 终未能成功 (即这场革命最终未能彻底推翻专制统治)，而专制统治要求人们服从政府权威, 并限制个人自由，但它所激发的社会和政治改革, 却极大地影响了现代国家的特征。






In the early nineteenth century, the upheaval of revolution gave way to political philosophies and ideologies intended to restore order and prevent the types of violent clashes that had defined much of the previous century. As belief in popular sovereignty and principles of liberty and equality spread, particularly in Europe and North America, emerging nations came to hold different ideas about the best way to safeguard these revolutionary gains. In particular, nationalism, liberalism, and conservatism became entrenched forces that, while unique, all temporarily subdued the unrest of the revolutionary period. In a radically transformed political landscape, however, revolts and revolutions eventually emerged that challenged the last remnants of the prerevolutionary status quo.

十九世纪初，革命的剧变让位于旨在恢复秩序并防止上世纪大部分时间出现的暴力冲突的政治哲学和 意识形态。随着对人民主权以及自由和平等原则的信仰的传播，特别是在欧洲和北美，新兴国家开始 对捍卫这些革命成果的最佳方式持有不同的想法。特别是，民族主义、自由主义和保守主义成为根深 蒂固的力量，虽然独特，但都暂时平息了革命时期的动荡。然而，在彻底改变的政治格局中，叛乱和 革命最终出现，挑战了革命前的现状的最后残余。

Nationalism

民族主义

A radical political ideology that promotes the interests of the nation over international concerns, nationalism advocates the uniqueness and inherent superiority of an individual’s own country and the right to self-determination and political autonomy. It can also generate hostility toward outsiders and marginalize minority communities.

民族主义是一种将国家利益置于国际问题之上的激进政治意识形态，主张个人国家的独特性和固有优 越性以及自决权和政治自治权。但 它也可能产生对外来者的敌意并使少数群体边缘化

At times, though, people who share a national identity (or “nationality”) may be scattered across a variety of different states. For example, in Europe in the nineteenth century, people who were ethnically German and spoke the German language lived in many different kingdoms, principalities, and other political units. In such a case, nationalists seek to unify all those with the same national identity in the same state, so that all live under the same government, which members of that nationality control, within the same territorial borders.

但有时，拥有相同国家身份（或“国籍”）的人可能分散在各个不同的州。例如，在十九世纪的欧洲，德 意志民族和说德语的人生活在许多不同的王国、公国和其他政治单位。在这种情况下，民族主义者寻 求将所有具有相同民族身份的人统一在同一个国家，以便所有人都生活在同一个政府之下，由该民族 成员控制，在同一个领土边界内。

At other times, people who share a national identity may live in a state governed by people of a different nationality. Jews, for example, share a Jewish identity but, except for those who live in Israel (a state that was founded only in 1948), Jews live in states dominated by people of other nationalities. In such cases, nationalists may advocate that a separate state be formed by members of the minority nationality, so that they may live and govern themselves without the interference of other, sometimes hostile, groups. In the nineteenth century, a Jewish movement called Zionism formed to advocate for the establishment of a separate state for Jews.

在其他时候，具有同一民族身份的人可能生活在由不同国籍的人统治的国家中。例如，犹太人拥有犹 太人的身份，但除了居住在以色列（1948 年才成立的国家）的犹太人外，犹太人生活在由其他民族的 人统治的国家中。在这种情况下，民族主义者可能会主张由少数民族成员组建一个独立的国家，以便 他们可以在不受其他有时是敌对群体的干扰的情况下生活和自治。十九世纪，犹太复国主义运动兴 起，主张为犹太人建立一个独立的国家。

This sense of shared identity and heritage laid the groundwork for the nationalism that ultimately led to the unification of Italy and of Germany over the course of the nineteenth century.

这种共同的身份和遗产感为民族主义奠定 了基础，最终导致了意大利和德国在十九世纪的统一。

In the first half of the nineteenth century, Italy was a loose coalition of states under the control of the Austrian Empire and the Catholic Church.

十九世纪上半叶，意大利是奥地利帝国和天主教会控制下的松散国家联盟。

In predominantly German-speaking lands, an alliance of thirty-nine sovereign states known as the Germanic Confederation emerged as a replacement for the former Holy Roman Empire in 1815. Because each of the member states retained political autonomy, the Germanic Confederation lacked executive power or centralized authority. The main goal of the Confederation, however, was not to replace the governmental powers of its member states but rather to create a unified defense against France and Russia. Although it eventually succumbed to the Austrian Empire in 1866, the Confederation laid the groundwork for the nationalism that inspired German unification in 1871 and the creation of the modern nation-state of Germany.

1815 年，在以德语为主的地区，由 39 个主权国家组成的联盟（称为日耳曼联邦）出现，取代了前神 圣罗马帝国。由于每个成员国都保留政治自治权，日耳曼联邦缺乏行政权力或权力。中央集权。然 而，联邦的主要目标不是取代其成员国的政府权力，而是建立一个针对法国和俄罗斯的统一防御体 系。尽管联邦最终于 1866 年屈服于奥地利帝国，但它为激发 1871 年德国统一和现代民族国家德国创 建的民族主义奠定了基础。

Bismarck’s efforts culminated in the formation of a unified Germany, and on January 18, 1871, he was appointed Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire.

俾斯麦的努力最终促成了统一德国的形成，并于1871年1月18日被任命为德意志帝国总理 。

Germany Unified. This map depicts the unified German nation in 1871 and the patchwork of previously autonomous states that merged under the principles of nationalism to form a single country.

Unlike nationalism, patriotism does not entail asserting the superiority of one nation over others.

与民族主义不同，爱国主义并不意味着主张一个国家相对于其他国家的优越性。

Liberalism

自由主义

Like nationalism, the political philosophy of liberalism is rooted in Enlightenment principles and born of the revolutionary struggles of the eighteenth century. Its underlying goal is freedom from restraint, more specifically freedom of expression, popular sovereignty, representative government, and the protection of private property and civil rights. The liberalism of the nineteenth century is different from the liberalism of the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however. The meaning of the term has changed over time, and, although people who are regarded as liberals in the twentyfirst century United States generally advocate for government assistance for the poor and government intervention to ensure equality, nineteenth-century liberals opposed government intervention. Liberalism and nationalism are not mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, a distinction between political and economic liberalism evolved from the work of Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke and Adam Smith.

与民族主义一样，自由主义的政治哲学植根于启蒙原则，诞生于十八世纪的革命斗争。其根本目标是 不受限制的自由，更具体地说是言论自由、人民主权、代议制政府以及保护私有财产和公民权利。然 而，十九世纪的自由主义与二十世纪末和二十一世纪的自由主义不同。这个词的含义随着时间的推移 而发生了变化，尽管在二十一世纪的美国被视为自由主义者的人普遍主张政府援助穷人和政府干预以 确保平等，但十九世纪的自由主义者反对政府干预。自由主义和民族主义并不相互排斥. 然而，政治自由主义和经济自由主义之间的 区别是从约翰·洛克和亚当·斯密等启蒙思想家的著作中演变而来的。

Based on Locke’s emphasis on the consent of the governed and the natural rights of life, liberty, and property, political liberalism promotes limited government and the right to oppose any political authority that does not carry the consent of the people. These goals can be ensured by imposing limits on government authority and guaranteeing rights to all citizens in a written constitution. Religious toleration and the separation of church and state also became fundamental principles of liberalism in the eighteenth century. All played a significant role in shaping revolutionary movements in Britain’s North American colonies, Haiti, and France, all of which issued written constitutions asserting the sovereignty of the people. Enlightenment ideas of natural rights—tested through a series of revolutions—developed into a lasting commitment to consent of the governed and equality before the law in the liberal political philosophies of the nineteenth century.

基于洛克强调被统治者的同意以及生命、自由和财产等自然权利，政治自由主义提倡有限政府和反对 任何未经人民同意的政治权威的权利。这些目标可以通过对政府权力施加限制并在成文宪法中保障所 有公民的权利来确保。宗教宽容和政教分离也成为十八世纪自由主义的基本原则。他们都在英国北美 殖民地、海地和法国的革命运动中发挥了重要作用，这些国家都颁布了成文宪法，维护人民的主权。 自然权利的启蒙思想经过一系列革命的考验，发展成为十九世纪自由政治哲学中对被统治者的同意和 法律面前人人平等的持久承诺。(西方在社会思想进步上，真是领先中国两三百年。中国的民权现在比人家18世纪还不如)

One of the most celebrated proponents of liberalism in the nineteenth century was the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, who argued for the protection of individual rights from censorship and tyranny. On Liberty, his classic treatise published in 1859, emphasized the importance of toleration and stressed that multiple ethical codes could coexist peacefully in a given society.

十九世纪最著名的自由主义支持者之一是英国哲学家约翰·斯图尔特·密尔(John Stuart Mill)，他主张保 护个人权利免受审查和暴政。他于 1859 年发表的经典著作《论自由》强调了宽容的重要性，并强调多 种道德准则可以在特定社会中和平共处。

Whereas Mill and Locke focused liberalism on principles of natural rights and equality, economic liberalism derived from the Enlightenment theories of Scottish economist Adam Smith. Smith, whose theories shaped the burgeoning capitalism of the era, argued for the principle of laissez-faire, the idea that economic affairs should be free of government interference.

穆勒和洛克将自由主义重点放在自然权利和平等原则上，而经济自由主义则源自苏格兰经济学家亚当· 斯密的启蒙理论。史密斯的理论塑造了那个时代蓬勃发展的资本主义，他主张自由放任原则，即经济 事务不应受到政府干预。

Conservatism

保守主义

Conservative theorists asserted that individual rights were secondary to the rights of the community, and that the only acceptable way to generate political change was slowly and gradually rather than through revolution.

保守派理论家声称，个人权利次于社 区权利，产生政治变革的唯一可接受的方式是缓慢而渐进，而不是通过革命。

The central goal of conservative leaders in early nineteenth-century Europe, like the Austrian foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, was to prevent future revolutions and maintain a favorable balance of power, an equilibrium that prevents one nation from dominating others. In response to the Napoleonic Wars, during which Napoléon sought to create a Grand Empire that expanded French power over much of the European continent at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Metternich and his allies sought to contain France and restore order by establishing conservative political regimes.

十九世纪初欧洲保守派领导人的核心目标，如奥地利外交部长克莱门斯·冯·梅特涅，是防止未来的革命 并维持有利的权力平衡，即防止一个国家 统治其他国家的平衡。十九世纪初，拿破仑试图建立一个大 帝国，将法国的权力扩展到欧洲大陆的大部分地区，为了应对拿破仑战争，梅特涅和他的盟友试图通 过建立保守的政治政权来遏制法国并恢复秩序。

Men from the upper classes of society who throw themselves into the tide of revolution are either those who disguise their ambition or perverse, lost souls in the widest meaning of these words.

(保守主义者 Klemens von Metternich 克莱门斯·冯·梅特涅 的话: )投身于革命浪潮的上层人士，要么是那些掩饰自己野心的人，要么是那些倒行逆施、迷 失灵魂的人。

To ensure that no single country could conquer others, they agreed to divide military and political power more equitably among themselves.

为了确保没有一个 国家能够征服其他国家，他们同意在彼此之间更公平地分配军事和政治权力。

In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, most European American colonies gained their independence.

。在十九世纪的前三十年，大多数欧洲美洲殖 民地获得了独立。

The hundred years after 1750 marked a profound restructuring of world power and a host of political and economic changes in the Atlantic world. The Revolutionary War (1776–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), and the Peninsular War (1808–1814) were watershed events that reverberated across South America on inspiring waves of revolutionary upheavals.

1750 年之后的百年标志着世界权力的深刻重组以及大西洋世界的一系列政治和经济变革。。独立战争（1776- 1783）、法国大革命（1789-1799）和半岛战争（1808-1814）是具有里程碑意义的事件，在整个南 美洲引起了革命动乱的浪潮。
