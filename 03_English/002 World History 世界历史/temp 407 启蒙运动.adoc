The eighteenth century was an era of radical political transformation, social upheaval, and farreaching change that reverberated across the Atlantic. As new ideas began to challenge traditional political structures and hierarchies, people increasingly debated the rights of individuals and the proper limits of royal and religious authority.

The Enlightenment embraced the principles of reason and intellectual optimism. Enlightenment ideals were only partially realized. But the growing spirit of critical thinking ultimately inspired a series of revolutions that radically transformed political and economic life.

十八世纪是一个激进的政治变革、社会动荡和影响大西洋彼岸的深远变革的时代。随着新思想开始挑 战传统的政治结构和等级制度，人们越来越多地争论个人权利以及王室和宗教权威的适当限制。

启蒙 运动信奉理性和理智乐观主义的原则。启蒙理想只实现了一部分。但日益增长的批判性思维精神最终 激发了一系列革命，从根本上改变了政治和经济生活。

In the American Revolution, colonists’ rejection of arbitrary monarchical power and taxation expanded into a full-fledged demand for national independence. The French Revolution also represented a rejection of traditional royal privileges and the inauguration of a new political model. In neither case, however, did the demands for freedom and inclusion extend to Black people, Native Americans, women, or religious minorities. As the first sustained and successful challenge to the institution of slavery in the Atlantic world, the Haitian Revolution, more than any other conflict of the eighteenth century, resulted in the most widespread radical change. Rather than being universally supported, however, each of these three revolutions and their embrace of newfound freedoms met with a reactionary backlash, the effects of which reached into the modern world.

在美国革命中，殖民者对专制君主权力和税收的拒绝扩展为对民族独立的全面要求。法国大革命还代 表着对传统王室特权的拒绝和新政治模式的开启。然而，在这两种情况下，对自由和包容的要求都没 有延伸到黑人、美洲原住民、妇女或宗教少数群体。作为大西洋世界对奴隶制制度的第一次持续而成 功的挑战，海地革命比 18 世纪的任何其他冲突都更能带来最广泛的根本变革。然而，这三场革命及其 对新自由的拥抱并没有得到普遍支持，而是遭到了反动势力的强烈抵制，其影响波及到了现代世界。

The key principles of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Scientific Revolution established the view that the universe was orderly and rational. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, this idea had prompted significant challenges to Christianity’s traditional justification for social hierarchies and its view of the nature of the cosmos.

During the eighteenth century, thinkers in academia and beyond continued their critical exploration, scrutinizing traditional structures from religion to the monarchy. This newfound critical spirit and robust exchange of ideas ultimately became known as the Enlightenment.

十六世纪和十七世纪科学革命的关键原则确立了宇宙是有序和理性的观点。到十八世纪初，这一思想 对基督教对社会等级制度的传统辩护及其宇宙本质观提出了重大挑战。十八世纪期 间，学术界及其他领域的思想家继续进行批判性探索，审视从宗教到君主制的传统结构。这种新发现 的批判精神和激烈的思想交流最终被称为启蒙运动。

We cannot reduce the Enlightenment to a single unifying philosophy or body of thought. But Enlightenment thinkers in intellectual circles were inspired by the seventeenth century’s emphasis on using reason to grapple with questions about human nature, the complexities of political power and the social order, and the principles of logic and scientific thinking.

我们不能将启蒙运动简化为单一的统一哲学或思想体系。但启蒙思想家受 到了 17 世纪强调用理性来解决人性、政治权力和社会秩序的复杂性以及逻辑和科学思维原则等问题的 启发。

Among the principles that influenced Enlightenment perceptions of knowledge were the twin concepts of deductive and inductive reasoning. Inherited from the intellectual framework of the Scientific Revolution, these approaches represent different methods of organizing information and developing hypotheses. While inductive reasoning gathers specific examples and observations to arrive at a broad generalization, deductive reasoning, in contrast, begins with a general statement or theory and applies it to specific conclusions.

影响启蒙运动知识观的原则之一是演绎推理和归纳推理这两个孪生概念。这些方法继承自科学革命的 知识框架，代表了组织信息和发展假设的不同方法。归纳推理收集具体的例子和观察结果以得出广泛 的概括，而演绎推理则相反，从一般的陈述或理论开始，并将其应用于具体的结论。

The topic of natural rights, rights possessed by all human beings, such as the right to life and liberty, formed the focus of many philosophical treatises and conversations in the eighteenth century. Based on the premise that all people have fundamental and inalienable rights, rights that cannot be revoked or rescinded by human laws, the concept of natural rights originated not in the Enlightenment but in far older traditions of justice and natural law.

自然权利，即全人类所拥有的权利，例如生命权和自由权，成为十八世纪许多哲学论文和对话的焦 点。基于所有人都享有基本的、不可剥夺的权利（这些权利不能被人类法律撤销或撤销的权利）的前 提，自然权利的概念并非起源于启蒙运动，而是起源于更古老的正义和自然法传统。

Although many ancient religious and philosophical traditions developed interpretations of natural law, European Enlightenment thinkers transformed such ideas into a political system, which was novel at the time. The growing emphasis on reason and the desire to improve human life in the eighteenth century led Enlightenment philosophers to envision political systems based on natural rights, rather than the divine right of kings or traditional Christian social hierarchies.

尽管许多古代宗教和哲学传统发展了对自然法的解释，但欧洲启蒙思想家将这些思想 转化为政治体系，这在当时是新颖的。十八世纪对理性的日益重视和改善人类生活的愿望导致启蒙运 动哲学家设想基于自然权利的政治制度，而不是基于国王的神圣权利或传统的基督教社会等级制度。

One of the first Enlightenment thinkers to tackle the issue of natural rights was the English philosopher John Locke, who argued that people have fundamental rights to life, liberty, and property. He argued that all people are born in a state of freedom and that government should exist only by their consent, a principle called popular sovereignty.

英国哲学家约翰·洛克是最早解决自然权利问题的启蒙思想家之一，他认为人们拥有生命、自由和财产 的基本权利。他认为所有人都生于自由状态， 政府只能在他们同意的情况下存在，这一原则被称为人民主权。

Key figures of the French Enlightenment also debated the scope of natural rights. François-Marie d’Arouet, more commonly known by his pen name Voltaire, was an especially vigorous advocate of intrinsic rights and freedoms.

法国启蒙运动的关键人物也对自然权利的范围进行了辩论。弗朗索 瓦-马里·达鲁埃（François-Marie d’Arouet），更广为人知的笔名是伏尔泰，是一位特别积极倡导固有 权利和自由的人。

His contemporary Montesquieu also wrote extensively about the relationship between laws and rights. Montesquieu was principally concerned with the concept of political liberty and enforcing the separation of a state’s legislative, executive, and judicial powers as a means of keeping the government in check, which he discussed in his 1748 book The Spirit of the Laws.

与他(伏尔泰)同时代的 孟德斯鸠也撰写了大量关于法律与权利之间关系的著作。孟德斯鸠主要关注政治自由的概念，以及强 制国家立法权、行政权和司法权分离 (三权分立)，以此作为控制政府的手段，他在 1748 年的著作《法律的精神》 中对此进行了讨论。

The tension between state authority and the right of individuals to make decisions for themselves likewise inspired the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose contributions to Enlightenment philosophy included his influential treatise The Social Contract.

He also discussed the theory of the general will, a concept by which a state can be legitimate only if it is guided by the will of the people as a whole, rather than the whims of an elite minority.

国家权威与个人为自己做决定的权利之间的紧张关系同样激发了让·雅克·卢梭的著作，他对启蒙哲学的 贡献包括他有影响力的论文《社会契约》 。他还讨论了公意理论，根据这一概念，一个国家只有在全体人民的意志而不是少数精英的突发奇想的 指导下才能合法。

Bentham was an English lawyer known for his adoption of utilitarianism, a political philosophy that emphasized the goal of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

边沁是一位英国律师，因其采 用功利主义而闻名，功利主义是一种政治哲学，强调为最大多数人实现最大利益的目标。

As the argument continued during the Enlightenment period, it expanded into discussions of social contract theory that focused more specifically on the ethics and legitimacy of law and the political order.

随着启蒙时期争论 的继续，它扩展到社会契约理论的讨论，更具体地关注法律和政治秩序的伦理和合法性。

You will read two different perspectives on natural rights. The first excerpt, from a treatise written by seventeenth-century English philosopher John Locke, asserts Locke’s claim that people are naturally free and possess rights that are independent of laws imposed by any society. In the second, a late eighteenth-century treatise written in response to the declarations of rights associated with the French Revolution, English philosopher Jeremy Bentham asserts that such rights cannot exist without government and laws.

您将阅读关于自然权利的两种不同观点。第一段摘录自 17 世纪英国哲学家 约翰·洛克 (John Locke) 撰写的一篇论文，断言洛克的主张是，人天生自由，拥有独立于任何 社会强加的法律的权利。在第二篇十八世纪末针对法国大革命相关权利宣言而撰写的论文 中，英国哲学家杰里米·边沁 (Jeremy Bentham) 断言，如果没有政府和法律，这些权利就不可 能存在。

Social Contract Theory

社会契约论

At the core of Enlightenment debate about the relationship between state authority and natural rights was the fundamental character of the social contract. However, according to many social contract theorists like Rousseau, when a state fails to maintain the general will or protect natural rights, citizens may in turn withdraw their social and moral obligations to the state. The roles of justice and liberty in civil society thus formed the focus of much debate among philosophers and European rulers concerned with preserving the balance between individual rights and political authority.

启蒙运动关于国家权威与自然权利之间关系的争论的核心是社会契约的基本特征。然而，根据卢梭等许多社会契约理论家的观点，当一个国家无法维护公意或保护自然权利时，公民可 以反过来撤销对国家的社会和道德义务。因此，正义和自由 在公民社会中的作用成为哲学家和欧洲统治者争论的焦点，他们关心维护个人权利和政治权威之间的 平衡。

The social contract is not the same thing as democracy. A democracy is a government in which the power to govern rests in the hands of the people. Under social contract theory, kings and queens could determine what was in the best interests of their people and take such actions as they believed best protected their subjects. The two parties to the contract were the people on the one hand and the monarch on the other. The people surrendered their rights to the monarch and allowed the monarch to govern them, and the king or queen protected the people’s interests. As social contract theory and the concept of natural rights gained greater recognition in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, some absolute monarchs in Europe, such as Frederick the Great of Prussia and Catherine the Great of Russia, embraced the influence of the Enlightenment and became known as an enlightened despot. Although they maintained the absolute jurisdiction of their rule, enlightened despots differentiated themselves from other monarchs by claiming they received their power from the social contract to rule in the best interest of their subjects.

社会契约与民主不是一回事。民主政体是统治权力掌握在人民手中的政府。根据社会契约理论，国王 和王后可以决定什么最符合人民的最大利益，并采取他们认为最能保护臣民的行动。契约的双方，一 方面是人民，另一方面是君主。人民将自己的权利交给君主，让君主来统治他们，而国王或王后则保 护人民的利益。随着社会契约论和自然权利概念在十八、十九世纪得到更多的认可，欧洲的一些专制 君主，如普鲁士腓特烈大帝和俄罗斯叶卡捷琳娜大帝，接受了启蒙运动的影响，被称为“君主专制”。开 明的暴君。尽管开明暴君保持着绝对的统治管辖权，但他们与其他君主的区别在于，他们声 称自己从社会契约中获得了权力，为了臣民的最大利益而进行统治。

Despite their adoption of a seemingly progressive vision of universal rights, however, the societies in which Enlightenment thinkers lived did not offer freedoms to all people, nor were their writings as inclusive as they appear. Most women, men at the lower end of the social hierarchy, and people of color were generally excluded from participating in the Enlightenment or benefiting from its ideals of social and political equality.

尽管启蒙思想家采用了看似进步的普世权利愿景，但他们所生活的社会并没有为所有人提供自 由，他们的著作也不像表面上那样具有包容性。. 大多数女性、社会等级制度下端的男 性以及美国人民有色人种通常被排除在参与启蒙运动或受益于其社会和政治平等理想之外。

Social contract theorists generally justified such contradictions by asserting that Indigenous peoples were believed to lack the capacity to reason, and that Black people were incapable of governing themselves without the protection of White owners; therefore, they were not entitled to the rights and protections afforded to others.

社会契约理论家通常通过断言，由于土著人民居住在非政治国家， 并且由于他们被认为缺乏推理能力, 或黑人在没有白人所有者保护的情况下无法自治, 因此他们无权享有其他人民所享有的权利和保护，从而为这种矛 盾辩护。

Helping to spread these ideas was the emergence of the public sphere, spaces beyond the home and under the control of neither the church nor the state, such as coffeehouses and taverns where people could engage in free and open intellectual exchange, without fear of retribution. Before the late seventeenth century, public forums had been relatively uncommon in Europe outside England.

公共领域的出现有助于传播这些(启蒙运动)思想，公共领域是家庭之外、不受教会和国家控制的空间，例 如咖啡馆和酒馆，人们可以在那里进行自由和开放的知识交流，而不必担心遭到报复。十七世纪末之前，公共论坛在英国以外的欧洲相对不常见。

In the medieval period in Europe, opportunities for social encounters and the exchange of ideas had generally been limited to the domestic sphere of private households. Over the course of Europe’s seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, public spaces became a pervasive feature of its intellectual culture for the first time. Coffeehouses became a staple of European cities by the end of the eighteenth century.

For those who could not read or buy books, coffeehouse conversations thus allowed active participation in the intellectual culture of the Enlightenment.

在欧洲中世纪时期，社会交往和思想交流的机会通常仅限于私人家庭的内部空间. 在欧洲十七世纪和十八世纪的过程中，公共空间首次成为其知识文化 的普遍特征。咖啡馆在 18 世纪末成为欧洲城市的主要(社交公共)场所. 对于那些无法阅读或购 买书籍的人来说，咖啡馆的谈话使他们能够积极参与启蒙运动的知识文化。 (犹如新闻媒体作用, 能广开民智)

By the mid-sixteenth century, coffeehouses had become a fixture of social life in many communities of the Islamic world, where people could participate in a wide variety of conversations.

十六世纪中叶，咖啡馆已成为伊斯兰世界许 多社区社交生活的固定场所，人们可以在那里参与各种各样的对话。

Whereas coffeehouses were generally spaces in which people of all social backgrounds and statuses could mingle, salons in eighteenth-century France tended to cater to the intellectual endeavors of a more privileged sector of society. Situated in the homes of wealthy aristocrats, salons were informal gatherings of writers, philosophers, and in theory anyone else who wished to participate. In practice, however, only those with adequate wealth, leisure time, and social connections tended to do so, since attendance usually depended upon receiving an invitation from the salon’s host.

咖啡馆通常是各种社会背景和地位的人们可以交流的空间，而十八世纪法国的沙龙则倾向于迎合社会 上更有特权阶层的智力活动。沙龙位于富裕贵族的家里，是作家、哲学家以及理论上任何其他希望参 加的人的非正式聚会。然而，实际上，只有那些拥有足够财富、闲暇时间和社会关系的人才倾向于这 样做，因为出席通常取决于收到沙龙主人的邀请。

Salons met on designated days and were typically hosted and managed by women who not only decided who could attend, but also managed the inclusive, back-and-forth nature of the conversations. Salons served as essential venues for the exchange of Enlightenment ideas and eventually evolved into hubs of literary discussion.

沙龙在指定日期举行，通常由女性主持和管理，主持人不仅决定谁可以参加他们 的沙龙，而且还管理对话的包容性和来回性质. 沙龙是交流启蒙思想的重要场所。沙龙 最终演变成文学讨论的中心.

Conversation and debate in the public sphere were inseparable from the flourishing print culture of the Enlightenment era.

公共领域的对话和辩论与启蒙时代蓬勃发展的印刷文化密不可分。

The salons, print shops, and coffeehouses of the public sphere existed alongside more formal educational institutions and academies that also contributed to the intellectual culture of the era. Universities and scientific societies played significant roles in advancing experimental science and philosophy, but they were far less accessible to the reading public than coffeehouses and even salons.

公共领域的沙龙、印刷店和咖啡馆与更正规的教育机构和学院并存，这些机构和学院也为那个时代的 知识文化做出了贡献。大学和科学协会在推进实验科学和哲学方面发挥着重要作用，但读者对它们的 接触程度远不如咖啡馆甚至沙龙。

Unlike modern research universities, those in the early modern era existed to train students— exclusively male and economically privileged—for careers in the civil service or to practice one of three professions: medicine, law, or theology. The curriculum was generally designed to uphold tradition rather than innovate. Nevertheless, being affiliated with prestigious universities like Oxford, Bologna, and Paris carried power and prestige that enabled academics to make connections with wealthy patrons in court and aristocratic circles. These connections, in turn, could be exploited to finance more innovative research and scholarship in settings outside the universities.

与现代研究型大学不同，现代早期的大学的存在是为了培养学生（完全是男性和经济上享有特权的学 生）从事公务员职业或从事以下三种职业之一：医学、法律或神学。课程的设计总体上是为了维护传 统而不是创新。尽管如此，隶属于牛津、博洛尼亚和巴黎等著名大学所带来的权力和声望使学者们能 够与宫廷和贵族圈子里的富有赞助人建立联系。反过来，这些联系可以用来资助大学以外环境中更多 的创新研究和奖学金。

Scientific research thus generally took place in private laboratories with the assistance of a variety of academies and scientific societies. Their dependence on the economic support and protection of monarchs and princes meant that these institutions maintained ties to the state and lacked the full autonomy of the public sphere.

One of the first was the Royal Society of London, which first met on November 28, 1660. Newton was one of the group’s most celebrated members.

因此，科学研究通常在私人实验室中进行，并得到各种学院和科学协会的协助。它们对君主和王子的 经济支持和保护的依赖意味着这些机构与国家保持联系，缺乏公共领域的充分自主权。伦敦皇家学会 就是最早成立的学会之一，该学会于 1660 年 11 月 28 日首次召开, 牛 顿是该团体最著名的成员之一。

You can regard it as a shortened form of "One of the first few people/group of people" or something similar.

Like the Royal Society of London, the Academy of Sciences in France operated with the support and protection of royalty, in this case Louis XIV, who founded it in 1666. Unlike its English counterpart, however, the French academy was well funded and tightly controlled by its royal patron.

与伦敦皇家学会一样，法国科学院的运作也得到了皇室的支持和保护，路易十四于 1666 年创立了科学 院。然而，与英国科学院不同的是，法国科学院资金充足且控制严格由其皇家赞助人提供

Because of their connections to the court, members of scientific societies and academies were a small elite, but they also participated in public forums and salons of the Enlightenment and represented the beginning of scientific professionalization in the eighteenth century.

由于与宫廷的联系，科学学会和科学院的成员是一小部分精英，但他们也参与启蒙运动的公共论坛和 沙龙，代表了十八世纪科学专业化的开始

The growing emphasis the Enlightenment placed on natural rights, the autonomy of the wealthy middle class, and the cross-cultural encounters of the burgeoning global economy generated many social and political transformations in the eighteenth century. In particular, the entrenched privileges of the nobility, the traditional dominance of the Catholic Church, and arbitrary royal entitlements were common targets of criticism among those who could participate in the public sphere of the era. As fiscal crises developed and tensions exploded between European kingdoms and their Atlantic colonies, the rhetoric of the Enlightenment fused with a series of popular uprisings and created revolutionary conditions on both sides of the Atlantic. By the end of the century, the American, French, and Haitian Revolutions were the results.

启蒙运动日益强调自然权利、富裕中产阶级的自治以及蓬勃发展的全球经济的跨文化相遇，在 18 世纪 引发了许多社会和政治变革。尤其是，贵族根深蒂固的特权、天主教会的传统统治地位以及任意的王 室权利，成为当时能够参与公共领域的人们共同批评的目标。随着财政危机的发展以及欧洲王国与其 大西洋殖民地之间紧张局势的爆发，启蒙运动的言论与一系列民众起义融合在一起，为大西洋两岸创 造了革命条件。到本世纪末，结果是美国革命、法国革命和海地革命

The people of Paris captured the Bastille, a fortress and prison that had become a symbol of the monarchy’s despotism. The event is commemorated every year on July 14, France’s national holiday.

(法国大革命时) 巴黎人民占领了巴士底狱，这座堡垒和监狱已成 为君主专制主义的象征。每年 7 月 14 日法国国庆节都会纪念这一活动。

The French Revolution

法国大革命

Inspired by the success of their North American counterparts, critics of absolute monarchical power and entrenched aristocratic privilege in France began agitating for change.

受到北美同行成功(即美国建国)的启发，对法国绝对君主权力和根深蒂固的贵族特权的批评者开始鼓动变革。

Like the battle for independence in the North American colonies, the revolutionary movement in France reflected a complex web of causes and consequences. After a series of poor harvests and the near-bankruptcy of the French Crown left many peasants and urban poor on the brink of starvation in the 1770s, resentment of the regime’s inability to provide relief led to extensive unrest and rioting. The Crown’s subsequent attempt to institute a land tax on aristocrats, who had previously been exempt from such assessments, resulted in broad resistance from social elites reluctant to surrender their traditional privileges. Meanwhile, the growing middle class, resentful of its exclusion from political power, agitated for change inspired by the Enlightenment rhetoric of rights and liberties. Demands for the reform of an antiquated system of government and social hierarchy reached a point of no return in the mid-1780s.

与北美殖民地的独立斗争一样，法国的革命运动也反映了复杂的因果关系。 1770年代，一系列歉收和 法国王室几近破产，导致许多农民和城市贫民处于饥饿边缘，对该政权无力提供救济的不满导致了广 泛的骚乱和骚乱。国王随后试图对贵族征收土地税，而贵族此前是免征土地税的，但遭到了不愿放弃 传统特权的社会精英的广泛抵制。与此同时，不断壮大的中产阶级对自己被排除在政治权力之外感到 不满，在启蒙运动的权利和自由言论的启发下，鼓动变革。 1780 年代中期，对陈旧的政府体系和社会 等级制度进行改革的要求达到了无可挽回的地步。

Whereas the American Revolutionary War resulted in the birth of an independent new nation, the French Revolution radically restructured long-standing political systems and reshaped the balance of power in Europe.

Although the revolt’s radical rejection of authoritarian rule, which enforced obedience to government authority and limited individual freedom, ultimately faltered, the social and political reforms it inspired heavily influenced the character of modern nations.

美国独立战争导致了一个独立新国家的诞生，而法国大革命则彻底重组了长期存在的政治体系，并重 塑了欧洲的权力平衡. 尽管起义对威权统治的彻底拒绝（强制人们服从政府权威并限制个人自由）最 终动摇了，但它所激发的社会和政治改革却极大地影响了现代国家的特征。

At the core of revolutionary fervor in France was the traditional division of French society into three estates—clergy, aristocracy, and commoners—that reinforced the wealth and political power of the aristocracy and the church. In this system, which had emerged in the Middle Ages, the First Estate consisted of the Catholic clergy, who made up less than 1 percent of the population but held roughly 10 percent of French lands. Virtually exempt from taxes, the church derived substantial wealth from tithes (taxes of one-tenth of annual income) and fees imposed on the general population. The nobility, who were the Second Estate, represented roughly 3–4 percent of the population but held upward of 30 percent of the country’s lands. They also dominated the most prestigious administrative, military, and judicial positions in the royal bureaucracy by virtue of their aristocratic status and were exempt from taxes as well. The burden of paying taxes fell largely on the shoulders of the Third Estate, the remaining 95 percent of the French population consisting of peasants, the urban poor, the wealthy bourgeoisie or urban middle class who made a living largely through commerce and the professions, and everyone else who did not fall within the other two estates.

法国革命热情的核心是法国社会传统上分为三个阶层——神职人员、贵族和平民——这增强了贵族和 教会的财富和政治权力。在这个中世纪出现的体系中，第一等级由天主教神职人员组成，他们只占人 口的不到 1%，但拥有法国大约 10% 的土地。教会几乎免税，从什一税（年收入十分之一的税）和向 普通民众征收的费用中获得了大量财富。贵族即第二等级，约占人口的 3% 至 4%，但拥有国家 30% 以上的土地。他们还凭借贵族身份在皇家官僚机构中主宰着最有声望的行政、军事和司法职位，并且 还享受免税。纳税的负担主要落在第三阶层的肩上，其余95%的法国人口由农民、城市贫民、富有的 资产阶级或城市中产阶级组成，他们主要通过商业和职业谋生，并且不属于其他两个阶层的其他人.

French Inequalities. This cartoon of 1789 depicts the social inequalities and tensions that pervaded French society on the eve of the French Revolution. The First and Second Estates, a small minority of the population, controlled the majority of land and wealth, while the labor and tax burden fell on the Third Estate.

法国的不平等。这幅 1789 年的漫画描绘了法国大革命前夕普遍存在的法国 社会的不平等和紧张局势。第一阶层和第二阶层占人口的少数，控制着大部分土 地和财富，而劳动力和税收负担则落在第三阶层身上。

Exclusion from political power was another issue leading up to the revolution. The Enlightenment’s emphasis on public opinion, natural rights, and freedom from tyranny also resonated with many educated commoners and aristocrats, who believed that political and economic reforms were desperately needed in France. However, the Estates General, a general assembly made up of representatives of the nobles, clergy, and commoners that was France’s closest approximation to a constitutional body, had not been convened by a French monarch since 1614. Equally problematic was the voting structure of this body, which gave each estate one vote. Since the clergy and nobility generally shared common interests, their votes typically defeated any initiatives the Third Estate might propose.

被排除在政治 权力之外是导致革命的另一个问题。启蒙运动对公众舆论、自然权利和免遭暴政的自由的强调也引起 了许多受过教育的平民和贵族的共鸣，他们认为法国迫切需要政治和经济改革。然而，三级会议是由 贵族、神职人员和平民代表组成的大会，是法国最接近宪政机构的机构，自 1614 年以来就没有由法国 君主召集过。同样存在问题的是该会议的投票结构。机构，赋予每个阶层一票。由于神职人员和贵族 普遍拥有共同的利益，他们的投票通常会否决第三阶层可能提出的任何倡议。

In 1789, in an act of desperation, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates General to propose a radical reform of the economy and the creation of new taxes. But the Third Estate refused to participate until the king reformed the voting system. After a period of stalemate, the Third Estate gained the support of many members of the clergy and met separately as a National Assembly. This act of political rebellion reinforced the sovereignty of the people, to which the king responded by amassing military forces with the goal of subduing the people by force. His plan backfired, however, when a series of popular uprisings in Paris and throughout the country resulted in the commoners’ seizure of sites associated with royal authority, such as the Bastille, a fortress in Paris, land redistribution, and refusal to pay taxes.

1789 年，在绝望中，路易十六国王召集三级会议，提议对经济进行彻底改革并设立新税种。但第三等 级拒绝参与，直到国王改革投票制度。经过一段时间的僵持后，第三等级获得了许多神职人员的支 持，并单独召开了国民议会。这种政治叛乱行为加强了人民的主权，国王对此作出回应，集结军事力 量，目的是用武力征服人民。然而，他的计划适得其反，巴黎和全国各地发生了一系列民众起义，导 致平民占领了与王权相关的场所，如巴黎要塞巴士底狱、土地重新分配和拒绝纳税。

In a position of strength, the National Assembly then issued the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. As a means of reducing monarchical power and enforcing the mandates of the Declaration, the National Assembly created a new constitution in 1791 and charged a newly formed Legislative Assembly with governing France as a constitutional monarchy and developing legislative reform.

处于强势地位的国民议会随后发布了《人权和公民权利宣言》 . 作为削弱君主 权力和执行《宣言》授权的一种手段，国民议会于 1791 年制定了新宪法，并责成新成立的立法议会以 君主立宪制治理法国并开展立法改革。

Despite its progressive reforms, the Declaration faced opposition from critics for failing to address women’s rights.

尽管进行了渐进式改革，《宣言》仍因未能解决妇女权利问题而遭到批评 者的反对。

In fact, France was the last of the major Western powers to extend voting rights to women, in 1944.

。事实上，法国是 1944 年 最后一个向女性授予投票权的西方大国。

The newly formed Legislative Assembly suspended the king and created a representative body known as the National Convention, which convicted Louis of treason. The National Convention was composed of a number of different groups of revolutionaries with conflicting opinions regarding what the government of France and French society should be like. A variety of political clubs and organizations expressed a range of ideas about the goals of the revolution and the best course of action to achieve them. Founded in 1789, the Jacobins quickly became the most influential of these clubs. The Jacobins sought to end the reign of King Louis XVI and establish a republic to replace the French monarchy. However, disagreements between their radical and moderate factions made consensus difficult to achieve. Whereas the Girondins, a moderate faction of the Jacobins, some of whom hailed from the Gironde region of southwestern France, opposed executing the king, the radical Jacobin faction the Mountain, so named because its members sat on the highest benches of the National Convention, supported sentencing him to death. After the Convention held a trial for the king, the Mountain ultimately prevailed, and the king was executed in January 1793.

新成立的立法议会暂停了国王的职务，并成立了一个名为国民大会的代表机构，该机构判定路易犯有 叛国罪。国民大会由许多不同的革命者团体组成，他们对法国政府和法国社会应该是什么样子持有不 同的意见。各种政治俱乐部和组织表达了关于革命目标和实现这些目标的最佳行动方案的一系列想 法。雅各宾派成立于 1789 年，很快成为这些俱乐部中最有影响力的。雅各宾派试图结束国王路易十六 的统治并建立一个共和国来取代法国君主制。然而，激进派和温和派之间的分歧使得共识难以达成。 鉴于吉伦特派是雅各宾派中的一个温和派别，其中一些人来自法国西南部的吉伦特地区，反对处决国 王，而激进的雅各宾派“山地派”则因其成员坐在国民公会的最高席位而得名，支持判处他死刑。公会对 国王进行审判后，山岳派最终获胜，国王于 1793 年 1 月被处决。

After declaring those who opposed the king’s execution enemies of the revolution, in 1793 the Mountain and their supporters initiated a period of violent repression known as the Reign of Terror. Maximilien de Robespierre, a lawyer who championed the principles of equality, led the provisional government of France, known as the Committee of Public Safety, from 1793 to 1794. Under the battle cry liberté, égalité, fraternité (liberty, equality, brotherhood), this radical phase of the revolution achieved many progressive reforms, including controlling the price of grain, legalizing divorce, and abolishing slavery. Despite such achievements, however, it was also inherently contradictory, since tens of thousands of people were arbitrarily imprisoned or executed as a means of silencing dissent.

在宣布那些反对处决国王的人为革命敌人后，山岳党及其支持者于 1793 年发起了一段被称为“恐怖统 治”的暴力镇压时期。马克西米连·德·罗伯斯庇尔是一位倡导平等原则的律师，从 1793 年到 1794 年领 导了法国临时政府，即公共安全委员会。在自由、平等、博爱（自由、平等、兄弟情谊）的战斗口号 下，革命的这一激进阶段实现了许多进步的改革，包括控制粮食价格、离婚合法化和废除奴隶制。然 而，尽管取得了这些成就，但它本质上也是矛盾的，因为成千上万的人被任意监禁或处决，作为压制 异议的手段。

Disagreements between the Committee of Public Safety and the Convention over religious and economic policies hastened the end of the Reign of Terror as support for Robespierre’s repressive policies dwindled. By 1794, members of the opposition had removed Robespierre from power, and the Terror finally came to an end in July 1794 when its leaders, including Robespierre, were executed on the guillotine. The Convention then dismantled the executive powers of the Committee of Public Safety and sought to restore political stability by creating a constitution in 1795 that established a new executive council of five men known as the Directory. Despite the new government’s efforts to prevent rebellions and dissent, it faced a variety of challenges from radical Jacobins who wanted to restore the Terror’s revolutionary fervor and from conservative factions that sought to restore the monarchy. Growing conflict between moderates and radicals, sharpened by a period of famine and economic difficulty, ultimately led the Directory to invite Napoléon Bonaparte, a charismatic and ruthless general in the French army, to help them develop a more authoritative government in 1799 and quiet the voices of opposition.

随着对罗伯斯庇尔镇压政策的支持减少，公共安全委员会和公约之间在宗教和经济政策上的分歧加速 了恐怖统治的结束。到 1794 年，反对派成员推翻了罗伯斯庇尔的权力，恐怖统治终于在 1794 年 7 月 结束，包括罗伯斯庇尔在内的反对派领导人被送上了断头台。随后，国民公会废除了公共安全委员会 的行政权力，并于 1795 年制定了一部宪法，设立了一个新的五人执行委员会，称为“督政府” ，以寻求 恢复政治稳定。尽管新政府努力防止叛乱和异见，但它仍然面临着来自想要恢复恐怖革命热情的激进 雅各宾派和寻求恢复君主制的保守派系的各种挑战。温和派和激进派之间的冲突日益加剧，加上一段 时期的饥荒和经济困难，最终导致督政府邀请拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoléon Bonaparte）这位法国军队中 一位魅力超凡、冷酷无情的将军，帮助他们在 1799 年建立一个更具权威的政府，平息喧嚣。的反对 派。

Following the Terror’s failure, the revolution took a more conservative turn, and the idealism of the French Revolution came to an end. The modern democratic tradition emerging in France then transformed into popular authoritarianism when Napoléon seized control. Although he safeguarded some revolutionary gains, Napoléon also reinstated slavery in France’s colonies and declared himself emperor in 1804.

恐怖失败后，革命转向更加保守的方向，法国大革命的理想主义结束了。当拿破仑掌权后，法国兴起 的现代民主传统转变为大众独裁主义。尽管拿破仑捍卫了一些革命成果，但他也在法国殖民地恢复了 奴隶制，并于 1804 年宣布自己为皇帝。

Following a series of failed military campaigns stemming from his desire to dominate Europe, however, including a disastrous attempted invasion of Russia, Napoléon abdicated his throne in 1814. He then returned and led France again until his defeat by the British and Prussians at Waterloo (Belgium) in 1815.

然而，出于统治欧洲的愿望，拿破仑发动了一系列失败的军事行动，包括灾难性地入侵俄罗斯，最终 于 1814 年退位。然后他返回并再次领导法国，直到在滑铁卢被英国和普鲁士击败。 1815 年，比利 时）。

The French Revolution now appeared to come full circle with the restoration of the French monarchy in 1814–1815. However, Louis XVIII, the restored French king, could not rule as an absolute monarch and had to recognize his subjects’ new constitutional rights to participate in government and regulate the king’s power. Notwithstanding Napoléon’s brief autocratic reign, the French Revolution successfully dismantled the nobility’s and clergy’s disproportionate share of power and defeated the strongest absolute monarchy in Europe.

随着 1814 年至 1815 年法国君主制的复辟，法国大革命似乎又回到了原点。然而，复辟的法国国王路 易十八无法以绝对君主的身份进行统治，必须承认其臣民参与政府和规范国王权力的新宪法权利。尽 管拿破仑有短暂的独裁统治，但法国大革命成功地废除了贵族和神职人员过多的权力，并击败了欧洲 最强大的绝对君主制。

Perhaps even more paradoxical was the contradiction between Enlightenment ideals of liberty that fueled the revolution on one hand and France’s ongoing colonialism, exploitation of slave labor, and discrimination against free people of color on the other. Except for a brief period during the Reign of Terror, France continued to uphold the institution of slavery in its colonies. Ultimately, then, the legacy of revolution in France was mixed.

也许更自相矛盾的是，一方面推动了革命的启蒙自由理想与另一方面法国持续的殖民主义、对奴隶劳 动的剥削以及对自由有色人种的歧视之间的矛盾。除了恐怖统治时期的短暂时期外，法国继续在其殖 民地维持奴隶制。。最终，法国革命的遗产是好坏参半的。

In the early nineteenth century, the upheaval of revolution gave way to political philosophies and ideologies intended to restore order and prevent the types of violent clashes that had defined much of the previous century. As belief in popular sovereignty and principles of liberty and equality spread, particularly in Europe and North America, emerging nations came to hold different ideas about the best way to safeguard these revolutionary gains. In particular, nationalism, liberalism, and conservatism became entrenched forces that, while unique, all temporarily subdued the unrest of the revolutionary period. In a radically transformed political landscape, however, revolts and revolutions eventually emerged that challenged the last remnants of the prerevolutionary status quo.

十九世纪初，革命的剧变让位于旨在恢复秩序并防止上世纪大部分时间出现的暴力冲突的政治哲学和 意识形态。随着对人民主权以及自由和平等原则的信仰的传播，特别是在欧洲和北美，新兴国家开始 对捍卫这些革命成果的最佳方式持有不同的想法。特别是，民族主义、自由主义和保守主义成为根深 蒂固的力量，虽然独特，但都暂时平息了革命时期的动荡。然而，在彻底改变的政治格局中，叛乱和 革命最终出现，挑战了革命前的现状的最后残余。

Nationalism

民族主义

A radical political ideology that promotes the interests of the nation over international concerns, nationalism advocates the uniqueness and inherent superiority of an individual’s own country and the right to self-determination and political autonomy. It can also generate hostility toward outsiders and marginalize minority communities.

民族主义是一种将国家利益置于国际问题之上的激进政治意识形态，主张个人国家的独特性和固有优 越性以及自决权和政治自治权。但 它也可能产生对外来者的敌意并使少数群体边缘化

At times, though, people who share a national identity (or “nationality”) may be scattered across a variety of different states. For example, in Europe in the nineteenth century, people who were ethnically German and spoke the German language lived in many different kingdoms, principalities, and other political units. In such a case, nationalists seek to unify all those with the same national identity in the same state, so that all live under the same government, which members of that nationality control, within the same territorial borders.

但有时，拥有相同国家身份（或“国籍”）的人可能分散在各个不同的州。例如，在十九世纪的欧洲，德 意志民族和说德语的人生活在许多不同的王国、公国和其他政治单位。在这种情况下，民族主义者寻 求将所有具有相同民族身份的人统一在同一个国家，以便所有人都生活在同一个政府之下，由该民族 成员控制，在同一个领土边界内。

At other times, people who share a national identity may live in a state governed by people of a different nationality. Jews, for example, share a Jewish identity but, except for those who live in Israel (a state that was founded only in 1948), Jews live in states dominated by people of other nationalities. In such cases, nationalists may advocate that a separate state be formed by members of the minority nationality, so that they may live and govern themselves without the interference of other, sometimes hostile, groups. In the nineteenth century, a Jewish movement called Zionism formed to advocate for the establishment of a separate state for Jews.

在其他时候，具有同一民族身份的人可能生活在由不同国籍的人统治的国家中。例如，犹太人拥有犹 太人的身份，但除了居住在以色列（1948 年才成立的国家）的犹太人外，犹太人生活在由其他民族的 人统治的国家中。在这种情况下，民族主义者可能会主张由少数民族成员组建一个独立的国家，以便 他们可以在不受其他有时是敌对群体的干扰的情况下生活和自治。十九世纪，犹太复国主义运动兴 起，主张为犹太人建立一个独立的国家。

This sense of shared identity and heritage laid the groundwork for the nationalism that ultimately led to the unification of Italy and of Germany over the course of the nineteenth century.

这种共同的身份和遗产感为民族主义奠定 了基础，最终导致了意大利和德国在十九世纪的统一。

In the first half of the nineteenth century, Italy was a loose coalition of states under the control of the Austrian Empire and the Catholic Church.

十九世纪上半叶，意大利是奥地利帝国和天主教会控制下的松散国家联盟。

In predominantly German-speaking lands, an alliance of thirty-nine sovereign states known as the Germanic Confederation emerged as a replacement for the former Holy Roman Empire in 1815. Because each of the member states retained political autonomy, the Germanic Confederation lacked executive power or centralized authority. The main goal of the Confederation, however, was not to replace the governmental powers of its member states but rather to create a unified defense against France and Russia. Although it eventually succumbed to the Austrian Empire in 1866, the Confederation laid the groundwork for the nationalism that inspired German unification in 1871 and the creation of the modern nation-state of Germany.

1815 年，在以德语为主的地区，由 39 个主权国家组成的联盟（称为日耳曼联邦）出现，取代了前神 圣罗马帝国。由于每个成员国都保留政治自治权，日耳曼联邦缺乏行政权力或权力。中央集权。然 而，联邦的主要目标不是取代其成员国的政府权力，而是建立一个针对法国和俄罗斯的统一防御体 系。尽管联邦最终于 1866 年屈服于奥地利帝国，但它为激发 1871 年德国统一和现代民族国家德国创 建的民族主义奠定了基础。

Bismarck’s efforts culminated in the formation of a unified Germany, and on January 18, 1871, he was appointed Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire.

俾斯麦的努力最终促成了统一德国的形成，并于1871年1月18日被任命为德意志帝国总理 。

Unlike nationalism, patriotism does not entail asserting the superiority of one nation over others.

与民族主义不同，爱国主义并不意味着主张一个国家相对于其他国家的优越性。

Liberalism

自由主义

Like nationalism, the political philosophy of liberalism is rooted in Enlightenment principles and born of the revolutionary struggles of the eighteenth century. Its underlying goal is freedom from restraint, more specifically freedom of expression, popular sovereignty, representative government, and the protection of private property and civil rights. The liberalism of the nineteenth century is different from the liberalism of the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however. The meaning of the term has changed over time, and, although people who are regarded as liberals in the twentyfirst century United States generally advocate for government assistance for the poor and government intervention to ensure equality, nineteenth-century liberals opposed government intervention. Liberalism and nationalism are not mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, a distinction between political and economic liberalism evolved from the work of Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke and Adam Smith.

与民族主义一样，自由主义的政治哲学植根于启蒙原则，诞生于十八世纪的革命斗争。其根本目标是 不受限制的自由，更具体地说是言论自由、人民主权、代议制政府以及保护私有财产和公民权利。然 而，十九世纪的自由主义与二十世纪末和二十一世纪的自由主义不同。这个词的含义随着时间的推移 而发生了变化，尽管在二十一世纪的美国被视为自由主义者的人普遍主张政府援助穷人和政府干预以 确保平等，但十九世纪的自由主义者反对政府干预。自由主义和民族主义并不相互排斥. 然而，政治自由主义和经济自由主义之间的 区别是从约翰·洛克和亚当·斯密等启蒙思想家的著作中演变而来的。

Based on Locke’s emphasis on the consent of the governed and the natural rights of life, liberty, and property, political liberalism promotes limited government and the right to oppose any political authority that does not carry the consent of the people. These goals can be ensured by imposing limits on government authority and guaranteeing rights to all citizens in a written constitution. Religious toleration and the separation of church and state also became fundamental principles of liberalism in the eighteenth century. All played a significant role in shaping revolutionary movements in Britain’s North American colonies, Haiti, and France, all of which issued written constitutions asserting the sovereignty of the people. Enlightenment ideas of natural rights—tested through a series of revolutions—developed into a lasting commitment to consent of the governed and equality before the law in the liberal political philosophies of the nineteenth century.

基于洛克强调被统治者的同意以及生命、自由和财产等自然权利，政治自由主义提倡有限政府和反对 任何未经人民同意的政治权威的权利。这些目标可以通过对政府权力施加限制并在成文宪法中保障所 有公民的权利来确保。宗教宽容和政教分离也成为十八世纪自由主义的基本原则。他们都在英国北美 殖民地、海地和法国的革命运动中发挥了重要作用，这些国家都颁布了成文宪法，维护人民的主权。 自然权利的启蒙思想经过一系列革命的考验，发展成为十九世纪自由政治哲学中对被统治者的同意和 法律面前人人平等的持久承诺。(西方在社会思想进步上，真是领先中国两三百年。中国的民权现在比人家18世纪还不如)

One of the most celebrated proponents of liberalism in the nineteenth century was the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, who argued for the protection of individual rights from censorship and tyranny. On Liberty, his classic treatise published in 1859, emphasized the importance of toleration and stressed that multiple ethical codes could coexist peacefully in a given society.

十九世纪最著名的自由主义支持者之一是英国哲学家约翰·斯图尔特·密尔(John Stuart Mill)，他主张保 护个人权利免受审查和暴政。他于 1859 年发表的经典著作《论自由》强调了宽容的重要性，并强调多 种道德准则可以在特定社会中和平共处。

Whereas Mill and Locke focused liberalism on principles of natural rights and equality, economic liberalism derived from the Enlightenment theories of Scottish economist Adam Smith. Smith, whose theories shaped the burgeoning capitalism of the era, argued for the principle of laissez-faire, the idea that economic affairs should be free of government interference.

穆勒和洛克将自由主义重点放在自然权利和平等原则上，而经济自由主义则源自苏格兰经济学家亚当· 斯密的启蒙理论。史密斯的理论塑造了那个时代蓬勃发展的资本主义，他主张自由放任原则，即经济 事务不应受到政府干预。

Conservatism

保守主义

Conservative theorists asserted that individual rights were secondary to the rights of the community, and that the only acceptable way to generate political change was slowly and gradually rather than through revolution.

保守派理论家声称，个人权利次于社 区权利，产生政治变革的唯一可接受的方式是缓慢而渐进，而不是通过革命。

The central goal of conservative leaders in early nineteenth-century Europe, like the Austrian foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, was to prevent future revolutions and maintain a favorable balance of power, an equilibrium that prevents one nation from dominating others. In response to the Napoleonic Wars, during which Napoléon sought to create a Grand Empire that expanded French power over much of the European continent at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Metternich and his allies sought to contain France and restore order by establishing conservative political regimes.

十九世纪初欧洲保守派领导人的核心目标，如奥地利外交部长克莱门斯·冯·梅特涅，是防止未来的革命 并维持有利的权力平衡，即防止一个国家 统治其他国家的平衡。十九世纪初，拿破仑试图建立一个大 帝国，将法国的权力扩展到欧洲大陆的大部分地区，为了应对拿破仑战争，梅特涅和他的盟友试图通 过建立保守的政治政权来遏制法国并恢复秩序。

Men from the upper classes of society who throw themselves into the tide of revolution are either those who disguise their ambition or perverse, lost souls in the widest meaning of these words.

(保守主义者 Klemens von Metternich 克莱门斯·冯·梅特涅 的话: )投身于革命浪潮的上层人士，要么是那些掩饰自己野心的人，要么是那些倒行逆施、迷 失灵魂的人。

To ensure that no single country could conquer others, they agreed to divide military and political power more equitably among themselves.

为了确保没有一个 国家能够征服其他国家，他们同意在彼此之间更公平地分配军事和政治权力。

In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, most European American colonies gained their independence.

。在十九世纪的前三十年，大多数欧洲美洲殖 民地获得了独立。

The hundred years after 1750 marked a profound restructuring of world power and a host of political and economic changes in the Atlantic world. The Revolutionary War (1776–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), and the Peninsular War (1808–1814) were watershed events that reverberated across South America on inspiring waves of revolutionary upheavals.

1750 年之后的百年标志着世界权力的深刻重组以及大西洋世界的一系列政治和经济变革。。独立战争（1776- 1783）、法国大革命（1789-1799）和半岛战争（1808-1814）是具有里程碑意义的事件，在整个南 美洲引起了革命动乱的浪潮。
