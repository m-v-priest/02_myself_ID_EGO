==  ★ (我) 如何防止社会极端化政治思想

人类社会有一个本质规律, 就是一个社会人群, 只要随着时间推移, 一定会贫富两分, 会演化出富裕阶层, 和穷人阶层. 

如果贫富分化达到严重的程度, 尤其是”太多的穷人, 和少量的富人”这种数量分层, 就会导致社会不稳定, 因为穷人中就会产生一种”简单又极端”的”解决方法”思想 : 直接杀掉富人(资本家等), 掠夺他们的财富.  这就是中国历史上不断在发生的所谓农民起义, 和老毛的思想, 及文革时发生的事情. 

那么美国的思想家们是怎么来解决这个问题的呢? 更好的解决办法是: 扩大中产阶级的人数, 让社会的财富分层变成纺锤型.  即, 极端富余的人只占少数, 极端贫穷的人也只占少数, 中间富裕的人(中产阶级)要占大多数  (即, 纺锤的一头一尾只占小部分, 中间占大部分). 这样, 极端贫穷的人即使有极端思想, 也不会被广大人群所赞同, 而对社会的政治体制造成颠覆性影响, 而由于这个”纺锤型的社会”整体上是相对富裕的, 所以就可以是”社会福利制度”, 来资助那些极端贫穷的人. 这样, 整个社会就能不被”共产主义等极端思想”所吸引. 又陷入穷人杀富人的历史动乱循环中.

看看历史就能发现, 共产主义国家, 越靠近西欧民主国家的, 相对越有人权, 东欧的改革都是被苏联镇压的. 而越靠近东方的, 越残暴, 如苏联斯大林的大清洗, 柬埔寨红色高棉的大清洗, 中国毛泽东时代的各种大清洗, 朝鲜独裁政权, 还有北越.  共产主义国家可不是民主社会, 是不讲人权和法律保障的, 人民是没有法律来保护自己的. 所以用杀人来”塑造社会”是家常便饭的.

==  丝绸之路

The Silk Roads in the First Century CE.

公元一世纪的丝绸之路。

image:/img/0018.jpg[,100%]

The Silk Roads network was not a single route but many, including caravan routes that linked to the main trading regions, oasis towns, and overseas routes—the so-called Maritime Silk Roads—throughout the Indian Ocean.

Given the length of the route, few merchants covered it in its entirety. Goods changed hands many times over these long distances, being exchanged between merchants who each traveled only part of the “road,” and their price increased the farther they went from their origin.

丝绸之路网络不是单一的路线，而是很多条路线，包括连接主要贸易地区、绿洲城镇的商队路线，以及 贯穿印度洋的海外路线（即所谓的"海上丝绸之路"）。

考虑到这条路线的长度，很少有商人能完整走完全程。货物在这些长途跋涉中多次转手，在每个只走部分“路”的商人之间进行交换，而且距离原产地越远，货物的价格就越高。

The Silk Roads made up one of the greatest trade routes in world history, which reached its heyday between the fifth and eighth centuries. +
The Silk Roads facilitated the exchange of goods such as silk and spices, technologies such as papermaking, and cultural traditions and religions such as Buddhism and Islam.

丝绸之路是贸易路线之一,在5-8世纪之间达到了鼎盛时期。 促进了丝绸和香料等商品、造纸等技术以及佛教和伊斯兰教等文化传统和宗教的交流。

==  重商主义 (16,17世纪流行)

=== Mercantilism 重商主义理论

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, mercantilist theory was embraced by most European nations, especially France and England. Perhaps as much as religious fervor and a thirst for knowledge, this premise drove exploration and the establishment of colonies.

十六、十七世纪，一种"重商主义"经济理论, 被大多数欧洲国家，特别是法国和英国所接受。也许与"宗教热情"和"对知识的渴望"一样，这一前提(重商主义)推动了"探索和建立殖民地"。

"重商主义"的理论认为:

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2


|-> 一个国家的金银越多, 越好 → 地球上的金银是有限的, 所以国家间的经济竞争就是零和博弈

|A nation’s power depended on the amount of gold and silver it held. The world’s wealth as measured in gold and silver was finite, so a gain for one nation was a loss for another. According to mercantilism, there could be only one victor in economic competition.


一个国家的实力, 取决于它所拥有的金银数量。而以黄金和白银衡量的世界财富, 是有限的，因此一个国家的收益, 就是另一个国家的损失(即"零和博弈")。根据"重商主义"(的这个逻辑)，经济竞争中就只能有一个胜利者。

Because mercantilist theory saw economic gain for one nation as necessarily a loss for others, European nations engaged in trade wars as each tried to use tariffs to bar others from its markets.   +
At times, real wars accompanied trade wars. England and the Netherlands fought four wars over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, partially to gain control of transatlantic trade. England also fought France for access to the markets of India.

由于重商主义理论认为, 一个国家的经济收益必然会导致其他国家的损失 (认为是"零和博弈". 因为现代经济学, 在那时还未诞生)，因此欧洲国家卷入了"贸易战"，每个国家都试图利用关税, 来阻止其他国家进入其市场。 +
有时，真正的战争伴随着贸易战。英国和荷兰在 17 世纪和 18 世纪期间进行了四次战争，部分原因是为了控制"跨大西洋贸易"。英国还与法国争夺"印度市场"的准入权。

|-> 如果积累金银? 保持"贸易顺差", 多出口, 少进口

|Amassing national wealth depended on maintaining a favorable balance of trade, a situation in which a country exports goods of greater value than it imports.  Indeed, the ideal was to import nothing and produce everything in the home country, including agricultural produce.

国家要积累(金银)财富, 就取决于维持"贸易顺差"，即一个国家"出口额大于进口额"的情况。事实上，理想的状态是不进口任何东西，并在本国生产一切，包括农产品。

It elevated the interests of merchants and manufacturers over those of workers and consumers by arguing that wages should be kept low. More money would thus remain in employers’ hands, and people would be discouraged (or prevented) from buying luxury goods that could instead be exported for profit.

保持低工资, 让利润留在企业主手里, 压低工人工资, 这样才能让他们买不起奢侈品, 就能更多的将奢侈品去出口到国外, 赚取国外的利润.

|-> 政府应该监管商业, 用关税来阻碍他国产品进口, 以帮助本国行业的发展
|
- Governments commonly prohibited certain imports to prevent them from competing with domestic industry. In 1539, for example, to protect domestic textile manufacturing, France banned the import of goods made of wool.
- Governments also imposed high tariffs, or taxes on imported goods. These made foreign products more expensive and thus promoted development of a nation’s own industries.

对进口商品征收高关税, 帮助本国工业发展.

或直接禁止某些产品的进口, 以防止它们与国内同行业竞争.

- Governments might also grant firms monopolies over certain kinds of domestic production, establish and provide financial support for certain industries to ensure domestic self-sufficiency, and pay for internal improvements, such as new roads, to promote domestic manufacturing and commerce.
- Like France, both England and the Netherlands granted monopolies on foreign trade to private companies—the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. The purpose was to prevent competition among merchants that might drive up the prices they were willing to pay for foreign goods and drive down the prices they charged for domestic goods sold abroad.

对某些关键性行业提供财政支持, 以确保国内自给自足.

进行国内基建(修路等), 促进国内商业发展.

可授予公司对国内某些生产的垄断权. 目的是为了防止本国商人间恶性竞争, 而导致价格战, 内卷, 会降低产品的出口价格.

|-> 殖民地是必要的, 因为殖民地可以为母国提供原材料. 然后母国生产的产品, 可以卖给殖民地人民.(这就是对殖民地的剥削了)

|A colonial empire was necessary for economic domination. Colonies could supply raw materials for domestic consumption, so there was no need to purchase these resources from others. Colonial populations, in turn, provided a ready market for goods made in the home country.

To ensure that colonies added to their national wealth, European countries that established them usually required that they trade only with the home country. Thus, for example, England’s colonies in North America could sell what they produced only in England.

殖民地是非常必要的. 因为殖民地可以为母国提供原材料, 而无需从他国购买这些原材料. 同时, 母国生产的产品, 可以再卖给殖民地 (是现成的消费者市场).

因此, 母国要求殖民地只能与母国进行贸易 (内循环了).  北美市场上, 只能销售其母国英国的产品. 即北美人民, 只能购买英国货.

The industrializing powers could satisfy their needs for raw materials and markets only by reaching outside their borders to places in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean. To amass large profits, however, they needed to extract raw materials at such low prices that it was unlikely Africans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders would consent to them. In addition, and also unlikely, these nations would have to agree to purchase manufactured goods from their industrialized partners even though they might be able to produce such things for themselves.

Business owners and politicians in industrialized nations thus believed they needed to gain control over these distant countries and rule them as part of an empire. Quite often, military conquest was the means by which they did so. Once these foreign territories were secured, markets established, and funds invested, the imperial powers then needed to prevent encroachment on their possessions by other industrial powers. This led to them to exercise even greater control over their colonies and often to attempt to conquer neighboring regions.

Great Britain, for example, competed with Russia for control of Afghanistan largely to limit Russian access to Britain’s prize colony of India.

为了提高利润, 母国需要 ① 以极低的价格开采原材料，并且, ② 殖民地也不能生产母国的同类产品, 来和母国竞争. 显然这些要求, 殖民地人民不会同意. 因此, 母国就只能控制住殖民地, 并防止其他列强对其殖民地的侵犯. 但为了实现后者, 母国需要再向外建立缓冲区, 就导致他们经常试图征服邻近地区。例如，英国与俄罗斯争夺对阿富汗的控制权，主要就是英国为了限制俄罗斯进入其殖民地印度。

The perceived need to extract raw materials from colonies to benefit the home country’s interests often led governments to restrict colonies’ economic growth.

为了让殖民地无法与母国竞争, 母国就限制殖民地的经济增长.

|-> 殖民地只准与母国做生意, 以实现内循环.
|
- Spain exercised the strictest control over colonial commerce. Trade was limited to only a few ports in the Spanish colonies and the port of Seville in Spain.
- Those seeking to engage in trade had to procure a license to do so, at considerable expense.

殖民地的贸易, 只能在殖民地的特定几个港口中进行. 只允许从我定下的出口通道走, 就相当于海关作用, 防止你逃税, 防止你走私, 而将殖民地地的原材料流入其他国家中.

只能我(母国)信任的人, 才会给你发许可证, 允许你在殖民地做贸易, 这样你才能只和我母国做生意. 否则, 你就很可能会和其他国家也去做生意. 破坏了我想要的(重商主义)内循环.

|-> 发展海军和海外港口基地, 来保卫母国的殖民地, 和保护本国的国际贸易.

|They also maintained large navies to protect international trade and defend foreign colonies.

The ships that transported raw materials and finished products required ports where they could refuel and resupply, as did the navies that kept them safe.

运输”原材料和成品”的船只, 需要港口来补充燃料和补给，为了保障船只安全所需的海军, 也需要港口。

As more of the industrialized nations embarked on empire building, and as reaching international markets became an expected part of their strategy, the value of having strong navies to protect commercial trade only grew. Maintaining supply and fueling stations around the world to service these navies and fleets of merchant ships became a key argument in favor of developing more colonies.

(后来工业革命后, )随着越来越多的工业化国家开始建立帝国，并且随着"进入国际市场"成为他们战略的一部分，拥有强大海军来保护商业贸易的价值只会越来越大。因此, "维持世界各地的补给站和加油站，为这些海军和商船队服务"，成为支持"发展更多殖民地"的关键论据。

=== 对"重商主义"的批评

Mercantilism also had many critics. Many Europeans argued that the assumptions underlying mercantilist theory were flawed, and that putting it into practice was often harmful.

"重商主义"也受到了许多批评。许多欧洲人认为，重商主义理论的假设是有缺陷的，将其付诸实践往往是有害的。

|-> 一国金银越多, ①会导致物价上涨, ②通胀, 即物以稀为贵, 金银越多, 金银本身的价格就越低.

|Eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that as more gold circulated in a country’s economy, prices would rise, eventually becoming so high that no one would purchase goods. If abundance reduced the value of an item, then the more gold and silver a nation acquired, the less valuable it would be.

1.一国黄金太多(通胀), 会使物价上涨, 价格最终会高到无人会购买的程度.

2.物依稀为贵. 一国的金银(如同纸币)越多, 纸币(金银)就会越贬值, 那么这些金银就变得越没有价值。

解释: "If abundance reduced the value of an item" 这句话中的 "abundance" 指的是物品（包括金银或商品）的过剩。具体来说，这里指的是 金银的过剩。大卫·休谟在讨论经济时认为，当金银大量流通时，其相对价值会下降，因为它们的稀缺性减少了。换句话说，金银越多，它们的购买力就越低，这也是为什么他说 "the more gold and silver a nation acquired, the less valuable it would be"。

|-> 世界各国的经济贸易, 并非零和博弈

|The eighteenth-century philosopher and economist Adam Smith, also a Scot, criticized mercantilism as well. Smith argued that economic gain for one nation did not mean economic loss for others. Rather, trade could be mutually beneficial for all. It made little sense for a nation to produce everything it needed.

国家间贸易, 并非是零和博弈, 而是每个国家都有自己的”比较优势”, 互相贸易反而能增加所有参与者的收入. 因此, 一个国家生产自己所需的一切, 是没有意义的.

|-> 政府放松监管, 有利于经济发展

|Smith also opposed government regulation of the economy. In his view, competition among the producers of goods and the influence of the market (that is, the desires of buyers and sellers) made for a healthy economy.

市场有"看不见的手"功能, 能使经济供需匹配更有效率. 政府监管反而会扭曲这个"看不见的手".

==  "风险投资"体系的建立 : commenda 系统

The commercial empire that funded European overseas exploration began in the Italian city-states of the Middle Ages, but the investment system on which it was based did not originate there. This system, called commenda, established a sort of financial patronage by which investors funded merchants to expand their trading enterprises and earned a more extensive business network in the process.

commenda 的介绍, 见维基百科 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commenda)

By the late fifteenth century, Italian city-states were supporting a variety of small family-owned businesses and large companies. Capital was concentrated in land and commerce rather than in industrial pursuits, but credit was widely used. Across Europe, risk-sharing business ventures and joint investment schemes were already commonplace among merchants.

到十五世纪末，意大利城邦开始支持各种小型家族企业和大公司。资本集中在土地和商业上, 而不是工业领域，但信贷被广泛使用。在整个欧洲，"风险共担"的商业企业, 和"联合投资"计划, 在商人中已经很常见了。

==  探索新航路 (16世纪)  (为了跳过中间商, 获取原材料产地)

=== 探索新航路的动机 → 为了跳过中间商, 获取原材料产地

With the collapse of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in 1453, Muslims now controlled their tenuous overland connections to South and East Asia. As a result, they now had to go through Muslim intermediaries to purchase valuable spices such as cinnamon, pepper, cloves, and nutmeg that grew in only a few key locations. 

European nations, therefore, wanted to find an all-water passage to India and the chain of sparsely populated Indonesian islands known as the Spice Islands.

随着 1453 年君士坦丁堡的崩溃, 和拜占庭帝国落入奥斯曼帝国手中，穆斯林现在控制了"欧洲人与南亚和东亚的脆弱的陆路联系"。结果，他们现在必须通过穆斯林中介, 来购买肉桂、胡椒、丁香和肉豆蔻等珍贵香料，而这些香料只生长在地球上少数几个关键地点。 +
因此，欧洲国家希望找到一条通往"印度", 和"人口稀少的印度尼西亚群岛" （即香料群岛） 的全新水路。

The sixteenth century was a time of exploration and the beginning of global ocean trade.

十六世纪是探索的时代，也是全球海洋贸易的开端。

|-> 解决了: 不管风向如何, 都能向任何方向航行

|In the first millennium CE, Arab sailors in the Middle East had created the lateen sail, a triangular sail that allowed ships to travel against the wind. The square European sail gave ships power, but the lateen sail increased their ability to maneuver. When Europeans combined the two kinds of sail on three-masted ships, they could navigate confidently in any direction.

公元第一个千年，中东的阿拉伯水手发明了三角帆，一种可以让船只逆风航行的三角帆。欧洲方帆给船只提供了动力，而三角帆则增加了船只的机动能力。当欧洲人将这两种风帆结合在三桅船上时，他们可以自信地向任何方向航行。

The sternpost rudder, created in China in the thirteenth century, also allowed for steering against the currents.

十三世纪在中国发明的尾柱舵, 也可以逆流转向。

|-> 解决了: 方位指引 (古希腊星盘, 和 中国指南针)

|The adoption of these inventions allowed Europeans to abandon their long-standing practice of navigating by sailing along a coastline. Now they could venture into the open ocean, beyond sight of land.

这些发明的采用, 使欧洲人放弃了长期以来"沿海岸线航行"的做法。现在他们可以冒险进入看不见陆地的"公海"。

|(北美) 种植烟草

|Especially in the Chesapeake Bay colonies of Virginia and Maryland, where tobacco constituted the main cash crop, tobacco cultivation quickly drained the soil of nutrients, leading English settlers to push further westward in search of land for new fields.

特别是在"弗吉尼亚州", 和"马里兰州"的"切萨皮克湾"殖民地，烟草是那里的主要经济作物。但烟草种植迅速耗尽了土壤的养分，导致北美的英国定居者进一步向西推进，寻找新的土地。

|(亚洲) 香料 → 纺织品 → 鸦片

|When investors founded the British East India Company in 1600, they initially focused on trading in spices. As spices decreased in price and profit, however, the Company turned its attention to textiles produced by highly skilled Indian artisans. Finally, when the value of hand-woven fabric began decreasing in the early nineteenth century, the company pivoted to trading Indian-produced opium for Chinesegrown tea.

当投资者于 1600 年创立"英国东印度公司"时，他们最初专注于"香料"贸易。然而，随着香料价格和利润的下降，该公司将注意力转向由高技能印度工匠生产的"纺织品"。最后，当十九世纪初手工编织物的价值开始下降时，该公司转向用印度生产的"鸦片", 来交易中国种植的茶叶.

==  契约仆人 (殖民地移民的生存方式之一)

The colonies attracted many landless, unemployed young European men and women, too, who traveled to North America as indentured servants, bound by a contract to work for an agreed-upon number of years. After the landowner who paid for their passage had been compensated by their years of labor, indentured servants received their freedom and typically a grant of land as well.

通过合同, 土地所有者会为"契约仆人"支付旅费, 后者则通过通过多年的劳动来补偿前者. 之后，契约仆人就能获得自由，通常还能获得土地。

Like their rivals the Spanish, English colonists struggled to produce agricultural goods using only their own labor. Instead, they relied heavily on indentured servants, European immigrants who typically agreed to work four to seven years in exchange for transportation to the colony and the hope of a new life there after completing their service.

与他们的竞争对手西班牙人一样，英国殖民者仅依靠自己的劳动力, 是难以生产农产品的。相反，他们严重依赖契约仆人，欧洲移民通常同意工作四到七年，以换取前往殖民地的交通费, 以及完成服务后在那里开始新生活的希望。 

In the United States, indentured servitude had been common during the colonial period, and it was the means by which many Europeans obtained passage to North America. The practice had largely died out in the United States by the middle of the nineteenth century but still existed in a few places. 

在美国，契约奴役在殖民时期很常见，它是许多欧洲人获得进入北美的通道的手段。到十九世纪中叶，这种做法在美国已基本消失，但在少数地方仍然存在。

'''

==  奴隶制 (殖民地经济发展模式之一)

Coffee and sugar cane, introduced to the Americas by Europeans, grew exceedingly well in the tropical climates of the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and the southernmost portions of North America. This need for labor eventually led to the plantation-style slavery that took hold in parts of the United States, islands in the Caribbean, and areas of South America such as Brazil.

咖啡和甘蔗, 由欧洲人引入美洲，并在加勒比海、中美洲、南美洲和北美洲最南端的热带气候中, 生长得非常好。这种对劳动力的需求, 最终导致了"种植园式奴隶制"的出现，这种奴隶制在美国部分地区、加勒比海岛屿, 以及巴西等南美洲地区盛行。

European colonists in Virginia, like those in Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean, sought ways to maintain a permanent labor force, especially when it proved difficult to recruit sufficient indentured servants from Europe. Attempts to coerce the labor of fellow Europeans would have met with too much resistance.  +

Faced with a growing underclass of embittered poor White former servants, who in 1676 sought to overthrow the colony’s government, Virginia’s elite sought to solve their problems by drawing legal distinctions between people of European and African ancestry. Racism became the basis on which the colonial labor system was built.

弗吉尼亚州的欧洲殖民者，就像墨西哥、南美和加勒比地区的殖民者一样，寻求维持永久劳动力的方 法，特别是当事实证明很难从欧洲招募足够的契约仆人时。强迫欧洲同胞劳动的企图会遇到太多阻力。1676年，随着日益增长的不满的贫困白人前契约劳工企图推翻殖民地政府，弗吉尼亚的精英阶, 层试图通过在欧洲人和非洲人之间划分法律上的区别, 来解决他们的问题。种族主义, 成为建立殖民地劳工制度的基础。

By the end of the nineteenth century, chattel slavery, in which one human being is owned by another and can be bought or sold, lingered in only a few places on the globe. Some nations had already abolished slavery before the Second Industrial Revolution began. 

Japan officially did so in the sixteenth century. 

Britain abolished the slave trade and ended slavery completely in 1834. 

France banned slavery in 1848, freeing nearly all enslaved people in the Caribbean. 

In India, the Penal Code of 1861 punished those who attempted to enslave others. 

The Netherlands and the United States were among the last industrialized nations to end the practice, with the Dutch freeing enslaved people in the South American colony of Suriname in 1863 and the United States abolishing slavery with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to its Constitution in 1865.

Slavery continued in other parts of the Western Hemisphere, with Brazil not abolishing it until 1888.

Most Latin American nations ended slavery following their wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. Brazil, however, with its primarily agricultural economy, long resisted reformers’ calls for emancipation. In 1850, the country finally bowed to pressure from its chief trading partner, Great Britain, which had assumed the moral duty of abolishing slavery around the world soon after it liberated its own enslaved people.

各国废除奴隶制的时间:

日本, 16世纪

英国, 1834

法国, 1848

印度, 1861

荷兰, 1863

美国, 1865 (宪法第十三条修正案) (南北战争后)

巴西, 1888

大多数拉丁美洲国家在19世纪早期独立后, 就结束了奴隶制。但是巴西, 一直抵制废奴的呼声. 英国对巴西施压, 最终使巴西在1850年同意”跨大西洋奴隶贸易”为非法. 最后在1888年废除奴隶制.

'''

==  资本主义 (From Mercantilism to Capitalism 经济学思想, 从”重商主义”进步到”资本主义”)

Mercantilism, which advocated building a nation’s power by increasing trade through exports, had originally propelled colonization. But as people around the world gained their political freedom, they also became interested in economic freedom, and mercantilism fell out of favor.

Capitalism, a system in which prices and costs, not government intervention, serve to regulate the supply and demand of goods traded for individual profit, became popular.

"重商主义"主张通过出口增加贸易, 来建设国家实力，它最初推动了殖民化。但随着世界各地的人们获得了"政治自由"，他们也对"经济自由"产生了兴趣，因此"重商主义"失宠了。 +
资本主义是一种以"价格和成本", 而非"政府干预"来调节商品供求, 以获取个人利润的体系，这种体系变得流行起来。

Adam Smith was a Scottish political economist and philosopher best known for writing the book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), often referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations. Earlier scholars had written about various aspects of economics, but with this book Smith became the first person to produce a comprehensive philosophical examination of the way nations should manage their economies.

亚当·斯密 (Adam Smith)是一位苏格兰政治经济学家和哲学家，因撰写《国富论本质和原因的探究》 (An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations) (1776) 一书而闻名，该书通常简称为 《国富论》(看不见的手) 。早期的学者曾撰写有关经济学各个方面的文章，但通过这本书，史密斯成为第一个对"国家管理经济的方式"进行全面哲学考察的人。

'''

==  第一次工业革命 (约1760年代- 1830/1840年代)


=== 农业革命 (17世纪中期)

Beginning in the mid-1600s, the British enjoyed an agricultural revolution that allowed smaller numbers of farmers employing fewer farm laborers to produce a surplus of food, and that in turn led to a population increase.

从 1600 年代中期开始，英国经历了一场农业革命，允许较少数量的农民, 雇用较少的农场劳动力, 来生产过剩的粮食，进而导致人口增加。

'''

===  小屋(农舍)劳动 (18世纪) → 农民在自己的家里给企业主打工

In the 1700s, entrepreneurs in England found a way to make use of unemployed or underemployed farm laborers and their families. These entrepreneurs provided farm families with raw materials and asked them to produce finished goods in their cottages, a system that became known as cottage labor. Rural women spun wool or flax into thread, and men then wove it into woolen cloth or linen. Some farm families made bonnets from straw. Other people made nails, knit hosiery, or made lace. The entrepreneur collected their finished products, paid them for their labor, and sold the finished goods in towns and cities.
Because the farm laborers were not skilled artisans, they could not command high wages, and the entrepreneurs reaped great profits.

1700年代，英国企业家找到了利用"失业或就业不足的农场工人及其家庭"的方法。这些企业家为农户提供原材料，并要求他们在自己的小屋里生产制成品，这种制度后来被称为“小屋劳动” 。农村妇女将羊毛或亚麻, 纺成线，男人则将其编织成毛布或亚麻。一些农户用稻草制作帽子。其他人作钉子、编织袜子, 或制作花边。企业家收集他们的制成品，支付给他们劳动报酬，然后在城镇出售制成品。
由于农场劳动者不是熟练的工匠，他们无法获得高工资，而企业家却获得了巨大的利润。

'''

===  企业主在城市建立工厂 → 小屋劳动模式渐废

In time, entrepreneurs began to gather laborers together in one location, a factory. This decision gave them greater control over production because they could hire managers to supervise the workers’ labor. It was also easier to install machines in factories than in laborers’ cottages. Factories came to be concentrated in towns and cities. As work moved to urban areas, so too did men and women who could not find work on farms. By the late 1700s, British business owners, supported by government policies inspired by Adam Smith, were setting up factories and hiring many of these migrant workers.

随着时间的推移，企业家开始将工人聚集在一个地方，即工厂。这一决定使他们对生产有了更大的控制权，因为他们可以聘请经理, 来监督工人的劳动。在工厂安装机器, 也比在工人的小屋里更容易。工厂开始集中在城镇。随着工作转移到城市地区，那些在农场找不到工作的男人和女人, 也转移到城市地区。到 1700 年代末，英国企业主得到政府政策支持, 这些政策受到亚当·斯密理论的启发，开始建立工厂, 并雇用许多移民工人。(工人跟着工作跑，而非相反。厂在哪边，住房就能在哪边，哪怕是出租屋的)

'''

===  机械化 (18世纪末) → 为工业革命打下技术基础

In the late 1700s, western European nations began to adopt mechanization, the use of machines to replace the labor of animals and humans. Mechanization set the stage for the Industrial Revolution, a transition away from societies focused on agriculture and handicraft production to socioeconomic systems dominated by the manufacture of goods, primarily with machines.

1700年代末，西欧国家开始采用"机械化"，用机器代替动物(牛耕地)和人类的劳动。"机械化"为"工业革命"奠定了基础，工业革命, 使以农业和手工业生产为主的"传统社会", 进入到了以"机器制造商品"为主的社会经济体系。

'''

=== 工业革命 (约1760年代- 1830/1840年代)

During the Industrial Revolution, factories increasingly relied on machine power, most importantly the steam engine. A steam engine uses heat to transform water into steam, which expands and drives a piston to perform work.

在工业革命期间，工厂越来越依赖机器动力，最重要的是"蒸汽机"。蒸汽机利用热量将水转化为蒸汽， 蒸汽膨胀并驱动活塞做功。

Great Britain was the first nation to enter the Industrial Revolution, beginning to mechanize the production of goods in the eighteenth century. It was followed by the United States, France, Belgium, and, in the first half of the nineteenth century, by Germany.

These nations harnessed the power first of water and then of steam and began the mass production of goods such as textiles, iron, and steel. Perhaps most significantly, they also manufactured machines that produced parts for other machines.

英国是第一个进入工业革命的国家，在十八世纪开始实现商品生产机械化。紧随其后的是美国、法国、比利时，以及十九世纪上半叶的德国。 +
这些国家首先利用水力，然后利用蒸汽力，开始大规模生产纺织品、钢铁等商品。也许最重要的是，他们还制造了"为其他机器生产零件"的机器.

Russia lacked many advantages for industrializing that other countries possessed. It did not have many artisans. Russia’s population also consisted of many serfs who, unlike American and British farmers, were bound to the land and could not seek opportunities elsewhere such as in factories.  In 1861, it abolished serfdom, providing potential workers for factories.

俄罗斯缺乏其他国家所拥有的许多工业化优势。它没有很多工匠. 与美国和英国的农民不同，俄罗斯的人口中也有许多农奴，他们被束缚在土地上，不能在工厂等其他地方寻找机会。 1861年，它才废除了农奴制，为工厂提供了潜在的工人.

|埃及, 拉美 → 觉得自己只要卖卖原材料就好了

|As the United States and European nations industrialized, African, Latin American, and Asian nations, with the exception of Japan, did not. Historians disagree about the reasons for this Great Divergence.

Countries such as Egypt and the Latin American nations realized their strengths lay better in producing raw materials for the industrializing nations than pursuing widespread industrialization. In each nation, a unique set of circumstances influenced the path taken.

当美国和欧洲国家实现工业化时，非洲、拉丁美洲和亚洲国家（日本除外）却没有实现工业化。历史学家对于这次大分流的原因, 存在分歧。埃及和拉丁美洲国家等国家(目光短浅地)看到自己的优势在于为工业化国家生产原材料, 而不是追求广泛的工业化。 每个国家，一系列独特的情况影响了它们所采取的道路。(一开始无意中的选择, 就决定了你以后人生的整个命运. 毕业就选择当"谋技者"的人，肯定就和选择当"谋事者"的人殊途了)

|印度 → 被母国英国压制其工业化


|India’s industrial endeavors were greatly affected by its relationship with Britain, which had begun trading in India in the 1600s. Britain, however, had no intention of allowing its colony to become its economic rival. Like all colonies, India was meant to enrich Britain, not compete with it. Thus began a process often referred to as deindustrialization, a reduction in a nation’s or region’s industrial activity.

印度的工业发展深受其与英国关系的影响，英国在 1600 年代就开始与印度进行贸易。 然而，英国无意让其殖民地成为其经济竞争对手。和所有殖民地一样，印度的目的是让英国富裕起来， 是与之竞争。由此开始了一个通常被称为"去工业化"的过程，即一个国家或地区工业活动的减少。(用政策来抑制一个国家的产业升级)

|中国 → 在东亚一家独大, 周边缺乏竞争, 成为了温室里的懒汉

|China also did not become an industrial power in the nineteenth century. Historians have offered a variety of reasons.

First, no challengers in East Asia could match China in size, wealth, and military strength, so it had no need to compete with anyone.

Second, because China’s population was large and often poor, labor was abundant and employers did not have to offer high wages to attract employees or replace workers with labor-saving machinery.

中国在十九世纪也没有成为工业强国。 学家提出了各种各样的理由。  +
首先，东亚的挑战者在规模、财富和军事实力上都无法与中国相比，因此没有必要与任何人竞争。 +
其次于中国人口众多且往往贫困，劳动力充足，雇主不必"提供高工资来吸引员工", 或用"能节省劳动力的机器"来取代人力。

== 第二次工业革命 (1870-1945)

The Second Industrial Revolution began in the second half of the nineteenth century and lasted until the start of World War I.

第二次工业革命, 始于十九世纪下半叶，一直持续到第一次世界大战开始.

Between the middle of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, these nations embarked on a new phase of industrialization. European and U.S. industry was transformed again by new sources of power, technological innovations, new forms of transportation, and growing communications networks. This process is often called the Second Industrial Revolution. 

At the same time, industrialization began outside the United States and western and central Europe, especially in Russia and Japan.

在19世纪中叶, 到20世纪初之间，这些国家开始了工业化的新阶段。欧洲和美国的工业, 在新的能源、技术创新、新的运输方式, 和不断发展的通信网络的推动下, 再次发生了变化。这个过程通常被称为"第二次工业革命"。

与此同时，工业化也在美国和西欧、中欧以外开始了，特别是在俄罗斯和日本。

==  农奴制

Serfdom also largely disappeared in the second half of the nineteenth century. Serfs were unfree peasants who were legally bound to work the land on which they lived, land that was owned by another. Russia held nearly all Europe’s remaining serfs. Approximately eleven million were owned by private citizens, and another twelve to thirteen million were owned by the state. Tsar Alexander II abolished serfdom in Russia in 1861. In some parts of the Russian empire, serfdom lingered on for a few more decades.

农奴制也在91世纪下半叶基本上消失了。农奴是不自由的农民，必须为别人的土地而工作. 俄国几乎拥有欧洲剩余的所有未解放的农奴. 1861年，沙皇亚历山大二世废除了农奴制。但在俄国一些地区，农奴制又持续了几十年。

==  Penal Labor (犯罪者的惩罚性)劳役

Forced labor assigned as punishment to those convicted of crimes, known as penal labor, was also employed in the second half of the nineteenth century. From 1788 to 1868, British convicts, most of whom had been found guilty of nonviolent crimes, were given the choice of languishing in a cell or being transported to the colony of Australia. If they chose Australia, after an ocean journey that might last eight months, they had to endure seven to ten years of labor. The unlucky might be assigned to work gangs, building roads or constructing government buildings. Others went to work for farmers or merchants. After they had served their sentences, they were free to remain in Australia as settlers or return to England.

十九世纪下半叶, 还采用了用强迫劳动, 来作为对犯罪者的惩罚，称为"刑事劳动"。

英国, 1788-1868年时, 囚犯可以选择坐牢, 或被送往澳大利亚殖民地, 干7-10年劳动. 不幸的人可能会被分配去造基建. 其他人则去为农民或商人工作。服刑期满后，他们可以自由地留在澳大利亚定居，也可以返回英国。

Many other countries, such as the United States, also used convicts for labor or rented them for use by private citizens. People found guilty of and imprisoned for actual crimes were also often required to perform free labor, either inside or outside the prison. Prisoners were often used to build roads in the southern United States.

许多其他国家，例如美国，也使用囚犯作为劳工, 或出租给私人公民使用。囚犯常常被要求在监狱内外进行 免费劳动。在美国南部，囚犯经常被用来修路。
