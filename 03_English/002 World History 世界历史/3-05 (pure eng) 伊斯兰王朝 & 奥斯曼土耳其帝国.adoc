== 伊斯兰王朝

=== 早期

Because many people were illiterate at this time and not writing their history as it happened, we have less evidence outside religious scripture to help us reconstruct it. the Arabs transmitted this information primarily through a process of memorization and oral recitation.


Little unified the peoples of the Arabian Peninsula prior to the seventh century.

Seen from the outside, the Arabian Peninsula of the fifth and sixth centuries CE was a seemingly marginal space, on the southern fringes of the last great realms of antiquity, the Byzantine (Roman) and Sasanian (Persian) Empires.

In the very north of Arabia, along the southern borders of the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires, the people of northern Arabia regularly harassed trade caravans traveling to and from imperial urban centers. To combat this aggression along their southern borders, both the Byzantines and the Persians employed certain Arab confederations to create a buffer between the settled peoples and the raiders from the south.

===  (先知)穆罕穆德死后, 其集团面临的问题

When Muhammad died in 632 CE, members of the early Muslim ummah needed to immediately answer several important questions. Who was capable of now leading the community, of following in the footsteps of a leader who claimed prophecy—the ability to communicate with God—when none of those who remained could do so? Another critical question was about the survival of the community: what, exactly, had Muhammad accomplished by uniting the Arab tribes, and where would they go from here?

当穆罕默德于公元 632 年去世时，早期穆斯林乌玛的成员, 需要立即回答几个重要问题:  +

→ 现在谁有能力领导社区，追随一位声称有预言（与上帝沟通的能力）的领导人的脚步，而剩下的人都无法做到这一点？ +

'''

====  继承人问题

In many tribal- and clan-based societies like that of the Arabs, leadership was not hereditary, meaning it did not immediately pass to the heir upon the death of the leader. Thus, as Muhammad was dying, two primary claimants for leadership emerged: his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib, and a friend and confidant of Muhammad’s named Abu Bakr.

In the end, Abu Bakr was chosen to be the first successor to Muhammad.


There seems to have been near immediate recognition that things without Muhammad would be different, not least of which because the caliph was not assuming the mantle of another prophet capable of communicating directly with God as Muhammad had.


'''

====  联盟存续问题

Arab tribes had come together for a common cause in the pre-Islamic period, such as a war against another tribe or recognition of the strength of a chieftain. But once that cause had been accomplished or that chieftain had died, the confederacy typically disbanded.

Tensions arose after Muhammad’s death not just over leadership and inheritance, but also over whether the alliance was ever intended to last beyond its founder.

Some Arab tribes left to return to their homes, while others may have believed they could discard their commitment to the worship of the one God and membership in this confederation.

From the perspective of the Muslims, however, this was apostasy, and a conflict known as the Ridda Wars then began in an attempt to force these Arab tribes to continue to honor their agreements with the Muslims. The Ridda Wars also appear to have been expansionist, bringing into the fold, whether by treaty or force, Arab tribes that had never been aligned with Muhammad’s community during his lifetime.

This effort was the first step of a wider movement called the Arab-Islamic or Arab-Muslim conquests, and by 633 the entirety of Arabia had been brought under the control of this first Islamic state.




The term “Arab-Muslim conquest” has another drawback in that some participants were non-Arabs. Other fighters were Arabs but had not necessarily formally converted to Islam. In the end, the most important differentiator of status in this earliest society was not Arab versus non-Arab or Muslim versus non-Muslim, but rather conqueror versus conquered.


Little written material of the seventh-century Arab-Muslim conquerors survives.

===  (第1任) 倭马亚王朝 (661-750)

With Ali’s death, the Umayyads, led by Mu‘awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, established Islam’s first hereditary dynasty. Moving the capital of their state from the Prophet’s city of Medina to the Syrian city of Damascus.



It was not always clear that the Arab-Muslims would be successful against the Byzantines and the Persians, the last empires of antiquity. Nonetheless, starting in 634 and continuing into the early eighth century, they found enormous success conquering much of the territory around the Mediterranean basin and central Asia. The new Islamic state, or caliphate (an area under the control of a caliph), was larger than the realm of Alexander the Great, the Romans, or the Han Chinese; it was the largest empire the world had yet seen.

====  进攻"(东罗马)拜占庭帝国”

By the 650s, the Byzantine Empire survived the Arab-Muslim conquests, but it never again controlled much of the territory of the old Roman east.


'''

====  征服"萨珊波斯”

The conquest of Persia proved to be a longer-term process. Sasanian-controlled territory was vast and geographically diverse, and the independence the Sasanian nobility had wrested from the central government following the war with the Byzantines meant the Arab-Muslims needed to negotiate with many local governors and landed elites for the surrender of their territory.


'''

====  进占西班牙南部

In 711, however, the armies of the Umayyad Caliphate crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and overran the kingdom. The Umayyad armies that invaded Spain never succeeded in controlling the entire peninsula. Christian kingdoms persisted in the north, though they were weak and often fought with each other.

Another reason was that non-Arabic soldiers, like the North African Amazigh (Berbers), always felt shortchanged when Arab leaders divided the spoils of conquest. This ethnic and regional conflict played an important role in the collapse of the Umayyad dynasty.

The last decades of Umayyad rule were defined by factionalism and infighting. There, in the province of Khurasan, Arab- Muslims had settled after the conquests, often intermarrying with the Indigenous Persians. By the mid-eighth century, several generations of these mixed-ethnicity Muslims had come to feel disenfranchised in the region, and Khurasan became a hotbed of revolutionary activity. Many who were frustrated with Umayyad rule and ready for a change met to imagine a more open Islamic community.


'''

===  (第2任) 阿拔斯王朝 （749-1258 年）

This revolutionary group championed the right of the family of Muhammad to hold the position of caliph. Its members supported the claims of the descendants of Ibn Abbas, a first cousin of Muhammad, and thus came to be known as the Abbasids. In 749, after several years of growing dissatisfaction, they rose in rebellion against the Umayyads, overthrowing Islam’s first dynasty within a year and establishing themselves as the new rulers of the Middle East.

Abbasids claimed the title of caliph from the year 750 through to the early sixteenth century, although the power they sought waxed and waned over time.



In 750, the Umayyads in turn were overthrown by the Abbasids (749–1258), a new Islamic dynasty that sought to expand eastward from the Middle East even as the Tang dynasty drove westward from China. The Abbasids moved their capital to Baghdad. This change streamlined their dominance of the Silk Roads, letting them use the Persian Gulf to effectively bypass the Red Sea, which was the seaborne trade route closest to the former Umayyad capital in Syria.


Despite their ambitions, the Abbasids’ eastward expansion was halted in 751 when a combined Arab-Tibetan army met Tang forces in the Battle of Talas River near the town of Atlakh. Initially a stalemate, the battle turned in favor of the Abbasids when Turkic forces that were allied with the Tang switched allegiances and joined the Abbasids. Although the Abbasids were victorious, the engagement marked the end of expansion for both empires.

== (伊斯兰教, 突厥) 奥斯曼土耳其帝国 (1299-1923年)

With an empire that bordered both the western and eastern worlds, the Ottoman Turks began to play an important role in Asian and European affairs in the thirteenth century.


By the eleventh century, however, the Byzantines found their power challenged by the arrival of Turkic tribes such as the Seljuks, who settled in the eastern half of their domains and gradually wrested control of the area from them.

As different Turkic tribes arrived and settled in the region, one group, the Ottomans, soon rose to prominence over others. The Ottomans were Turkic-speaking pastoralists. The Ottomans eventually deprive the Byzantines of their last remnants of power.

Despite the challenges of the Black Death and the Mongols’ conquest and decline, Islam’s scope and influence continued to expand into Africa and Asia in the fifteenth century.



The areas west of the Volga River, populated largely by Orthodox Christians, were the only ones that did not see the majority convert to Islam, and they remain so to this day.

===  灭亡东罗马帝国 (1453)

The Byzantine emperor Manuel II had assisted Mehmed’s rivals for the Ottoman throne, attempting to keep the Ottomans weak by prolonging the civil war.

The Byzantines were also close allies of the Venetians and Genoese, who controlled trade in the Aegean and the Black Seas and whose ships could interfere with Ottoman efforts to control both sides of the Dardanelles.



He ordered that the Byzantine cathedral of Hagia Sophia be left intact and converted into a mosque. He also ordered a new mosque, the Fatih Mosque (“Conqueror’s Mosque”), to be built in the city.


Mehmed regarded himself not as a usurper but as the rightful successor to the Byzantines. He declared himself Caesar, the heir to the old Roman imperial throne. He appointed a new leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Gennadius II, who in turn recognized Mehmed’s claim as the legitimate heir of the last Byzantine emperor.

The last emperor’s actual heirs, his nephews, were taken into Mehmed’s service and occupied important administrative positions in the empire.



He issued kanun, laws made by the sultan, as opposed to sharia (religious law) interpreted by Islamic judges, and compiled them in the Kanun-name (“Book of the Law”). Kanun dealt with issues that sharia often did not address, such as taxation or punishment for certain crimes.

===  控制红海和黑海的贸易, 迫使欧洲人, 寻找去往亚洲的新海路

the Ottomans gained control of part of the Silk Roads. The Ottomans commanded Red Sea ports in Egypt after defeating the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517, which gave them additional control over the spice trade. The Ottomans also dominated trade on the Black Sea.

The exclusion of Italian merchants from their traditional trade routes, the heavy taxes imposed on goods that traveled overland, many Europeans’ dislike for transacting business with Muslims, and the expense of overland trade led western Europeans to seek all-water oceanic routes to South and East Asia.
