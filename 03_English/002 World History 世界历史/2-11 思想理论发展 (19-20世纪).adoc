== (民族主义) 民族主义观念 (19-20世纪)

The ideology of nationalism was taking hold across Europe in the 1800s, and in the 1900s it only grew. The prospect of having a country for each nationality was tantalizingly appealing: Poland for the Poles, Serbia for the Serbs, and so on.

At times, though, people who share a national identity (or “nationality”) may be scattered across a variety of different states. For example, in Europe in the nineteenth century, people who were ethnically German and spoke the German language lived in many different kingdoms, principalities, and other political units. In such a case, nationalists seek to unify all those with the same national identity in the same state, so that all live under the same government, which members of that nationality control, within the same territorial borders.

In the nineteenth century, a Jewish movement called Zionism formed to advocate for the establishment of a separate state for Jews.

民族主义意识形态在 1800 年代在欧洲盛行，并在 1900 年代愈演愈烈。"为每个民族建立一个国家"的前景非常诱人：波兰人组成波兰人国家，塞尔维亚人组成塞尔维亚人国家，等等。

但有时，拥有相同民族认同（或“民族”）的人, 可能分散在各个不同的国家。例如，在十九世纪的欧洲，德 意志民族和说德语的人, 生活在许多不同的王国、公国和其他政治单位。在这种情况下，民族主义者寻求将所有具有相同民族身份的人, 统一在同一个国家，以便所有人都生活在同一个政府之下，由该民族成员控制，在同一个领土边界内。

十九世纪，"犹太复国主义"运动兴起，主张为犹太人建立一个独立的国家。

This sense of shared identity and heritage laid the groundwork for the nationalism that ultimately led to the unification of Italy and of Germany over the course of the nineteenth century.

这种共同的身份和遗产感, 为"民族主义"奠定了基础，最终导致了意大利和德国在十九世纪的统一。

In an empire, however, nationalism was a powerful danger. Empires were built of many different nationalities, and they would disintegrate if each group were granted its own land and nation. The Ottoman Empire had already seen such pressures develop in its eastern sections, and Austria-Hungary faced this problem as well: more than ten different nationalities could be found within its borders. The concept of nationalism threatened the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s very survival.

然而，在一个帝国里，"民族主义"是一个很大的危险因素。帝国是由许多不同民族建立的，如果每个群体都拥有自己的土地和国家的话，帝国就会瓦解。奥斯曼帝国的东部地区, 已经面临着这样的压力，奥匈帝国也面临着这个问题：其境内有十多个不同的民族。"民族主义"观念威胁到了奥匈帝国的存在.

'''

==  (民族主义) 泛斯拉夫主义

The theory of pan-Slavic nationalism, which would unite all Slavic people under one rule, was a powerful one too. Slavic peoples have a shared historic culture and similar languages that include Bulgarian, Russian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovak, Czech, and Polish. They extended throughout the Balkan region and shared many of the same animosities toward the imperial powers of Austria- Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.

将所有"斯拉夫人"团结在一个统治之下的"泛斯拉夫民族主义"理论, 也是一种强大的思想。斯拉夫民族有着共同的历史文化和相似的语言，包括保加利亚语、俄语、克罗地亚语、塞尔维亚语、斯洛伐克语、捷克语和波兰语。他们遍布整个巴尔干地区，对"奥匈帝国"和"奥斯曼帝国"的列强有着许多相同的敌意。

By the twentieth century, Serbia had emerged as the leader of the pan-Slavic position in the Balkans. Its policy was characterized by hatred of Austria-Hungary and opposition to that empire’s forays into Balkan issues.

到了二十世纪，"塞尔维亚"已成为巴尔干地区"泛斯拉夫"立场的领导者。其政策的特点是, 对"奥匈帝国"的仇恨, 和反对该帝国介入巴尔干问题。

Russia, too, was a Slavic nation and showed great interest in what was happening to its historic kin in the Balkans. Indeed, Russia saw itself as the natural leader of any potential pan-Slavic political entity that might emerge in the Balkans.

Russia also saw Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans as rivals in the region and did not want either power to make any territorial gains. Russia hoped that by gaining influence in the Balkans, it could gain direct access to the Mediterranean Sea. Before 1914, however, Russia was not prepared to risk war to maintain this stance.

俄罗斯也是一个斯拉夫国家，对其巴尔干地区历史上的同胞所发生的事情, 表现出极大的兴趣。事实上，俄罗斯认为自己是巴尔干地区可能出现的任何潜在"泛斯拉夫政治实体"的天然领导者。

俄罗斯还将"奥匈帝国"和"奥斯曼帝国"视为该地区的竞争对手，并且不希望任何一方获得任何领土利益。俄罗斯希望通过在巴尔干地区获得影响力，能够直接进入地中海。 然而，在 1914 年之前，俄罗斯并不准备冒战争的风险, 来维持这一立场。

==  (民族主义) “民族自决”思想 → 每个民族都应该建立自己的政府, 建立自己的国家.

Wilson also strongly advocated self-determination, the idea that each ethnic group should have its own government. The treaty ushered in a major redrawing of Europe, and new countries flooded onto the map. Their borders were drawn by diplomats in Paris, however, and did not always reflect where people of different nationalities lived. Nor could they.

In an already diverse empire such as Austria- Hungary, people of different backgrounds lived side by side, so it was no easy feat to draw a border.

(一战后, 凡尔赛条约中,) 威尔逊还大力提倡"民族自决"，即每个民族都应该有自己的政府。该条约带来了欧洲版图的重大重新划分，新的国家涌入地图。然而，它们的边界是由巴黎的外交官划定的，并不总是反映不同国籍的人居住的地方。他们也做不到这一点。比如, 在奥匈帝国这样一个本来就多元化的帝国里，不同背景的人比邻而居，划定边界绝非易事。

The Germanspeaking country of Austria became an independent nation, as did Hungary.

The area of the Balkans, the site of so much uncertainty and nationalism prior to the war, received a particularly unfavorable decision regarding self-determination. The Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Montenegrins, and other Slavic groups there viewed themselves as separate nationalities, yet all were assembled in a single country, to be called Yugoslavia or “land of the Southern Slavs.” Yugoslavia was simply a diplomatic creation, and it did not survive the century.

德语国家"奥地利"成为独立国家，"匈牙利"也成为独立国家。

巴尔干地区是战前充满不确定性和"民族主义"的地区，在自决方面做出了特别不利的决定。那里的塞尔维亚人、克罗地亚人、波斯尼亚人、黑山人和其他斯拉夫族群, 将自己视为不同的民族，但他们都被聚集在一个国家，称为"南斯拉夫"或“南斯拉夫人的土地”。南斯拉夫只是一个外交创造物，它没有活过这个世纪.

Redrawing Europe. These maps show Europe (a) before and (b) after World War I. Notice the postwar proliferation of new countries created by the Treaty of Versailles.

重新绘制欧洲。这些地图显示了第一次世界大战之前（a）和（b）之后的欧洲。请注意战后根据《凡尔赛条约》创建的新国家的激增。

Internal ethnic issues had not been fully solved by the treaty (such as in the creation of Czechoslovakia) and could easily resurface given the chance.

但条约并未完全解决内部的种族问题（例如"捷克斯洛伐克"的创建），并且一旦有机会，这些问题会很容易重新浮出水面。

The rhetoric of self-determination of nations was not applied equally around the world, but its focus on nationalist ideologies filtered through many societies, spurring the growth of nationalist movements around the globe.

"民族自决"的言论, 并没有在世界各地得到平等的应用，但其对"民族主义"意识形态的关注, 渗透到许多社会，刺激了全球民族主义运动的发展。(那个年代有创新的政治思想，能推动世界各国进步，如今的世界各国只关心经济赚钱，是不是缺乏政治上的新思想呢？)

Most Africans were not considered citizens of the empires of which they were part. However, participation in World War I changed things for many Africans. More than one million Africans had fought in the war. The sense that their contribution should be rewarded with new political power was one result. Another was their exposure to international issues and the recognition that the principle of self-determination applied directly to themselves.

A number of groups had begun to argue for more African involvement in colonial governments beginning in the late 1800s.

大多数非洲人不被视为他们所属帝国的公民。然而，参加第一次世界大战, 改变了许多非洲人的生活。超过一百万非洲人参加了这场战争。结果之一就是, 他们的贡献应该"使他们得到新的政治权力回报"。另一个原因是, 他们接触国际问题, 并认识到"自决原则"适用于他们自己。

从 1800 年代末开始，一些团体开始主张, 非洲更多地参与殖民政府。

The peoples of Africa also wished to shake off Western control following World War II. The Atlantic Charter, a 1941 agreement by the United Kingdom and the United States regarding their shared goals for the postwar world, had promised self-determination for all, and African countries wanted to make this a reality.

在二战后, 非洲人民也希望摆脱西方的控制。 《大西洋宪章》是英国和美国于 1941 年就"战后世界共同目标"达成的协议，承诺所有人享有自决权，非洲国家希望实现这一目标。

==  爱国主义

Unlike nationalism, patriotism does not entail asserting the superiority of one nation over others.

与民族主义不同，爱国主义并不意味着主张一个国家相对于其他国家的优越性。

|自由主义, 源于启蒙思想

|Like nationalism, the political philosophy of liberalism is rooted in Enlightenment principles and born of the revolutionary struggles of the eighteenth century.

与民族主义一样，"自由主义"的政治哲学植根于启蒙原则，诞生于十八世纪的革命斗争。

|political liberalism 政治自由主义

|The liberalism of the nineteenth century is different from the liberalism of the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however. The meaning of the term has changed over time, and, although people who are regarded as liberals in the twentyfirst century United States generally advocate for government assistance for the poor and government intervention to ensure equality, nineteenth-century liberals opposed government intervention.

“自由主义”的内涵, 在19世纪, 和20世纪末与21世纪, 是不一样的. 即其含义随着时间的推移, 而发生了变化.

19世纪时的内涵 → 不受限制的自由. 包括: 言论自由, 人民主权, 代议制政府, 保护私有财产和公民权利 .   反对政府干预 (即, 人民要自由行动)

21世纪时的内涵 → 政府要援助穷人,  政府要进行干预, 以确保平等. (即, 政府要自由行动)

|( 政治自由主义) 洛克的思想

|Based on Locke’s emphasis on the consent of the governed and the natural rights of life, liberty, and property, political liberalism promotes limited government and the right to oppose any political authority that does not carry the consent of the people. These goals can be ensured by imposing limits on government authority and guaranteeing rights to all citizens in a written constitution.

Religious toleration and the separation of church and state also became fundamental principles of liberalism in the eighteenth century.

All played a significant role in shaping revolutionary movements in Britain’s North American colonies, Haiti, and France, all of which issued written constitutions asserting the sovereignty of the people.

Enlightenment ideas of natural rights—tested through a series of revolutions—developed into a lasting commitment to consent of the governed and equality before the law in the liberal political philosophies of the nineteenth century.

洛克提出: ①生命、自由和财产等自然权利. ②.政府统治, 需要征得被统治者的同意. ③有限政府.  如何来实现这些目标?  方法是: ①在成文宪法中保障公民权利. ②政教分离. ③宗教宽容.  这些内容, 都在美国独立革命, 法国大革命中体现. (西方在社会思想进步上，真是领先中国两三百年。中国的民权现在都比人家18世纪还不如. 受到统治阶层压制.)

|( 政治自由主义) 约翰·穆勒的思想

|One of the most celebrated proponents of liberalism in the nineteenth century was the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, who argued for the protection of individual rights from censorship and tyranny. On Liberty, his classic treatise published in 1859, emphasized the importance of toleration and stressed that multiple ethical codes could coexist peacefully in a given society.

穆勒提出: ① 保护个人权利免受审查和暴政. ② 多种道德准则, 可以在特定社会中和平共处 (即宽容)

|economic liberalism 经济自由主义

|Whereas Mill and Locke focused liberalism on principles of natural rights and equality, economic liberalism derived from the Enlightenment theories of Scottish economist Adam Smith. Smith, whose theories shaped the burgeoning capitalism of the era, argued for the principle of laissez-faire, the idea that economic affairs should be free of government interference.

经济自由主义, 荣誉源于"亚当· 斯密"的思想. 它主张"自由放任原则" → 即"经济事务不应受到政府干预"。这个思想, 塑造了后来的资本主义.

==  Conservatism 保守主义

Conservative theorists asserted that individual rights were secondary to the rights of the community, and that the only acceptable way to generate political change was slowly and gradually rather than through revolution.

保守主义, 倾向于: ①社群权利高于个人权利. ②渐进式改革的方式, 好于革命.

'''

==  “势力均衡”思想

The central goal of conservative leaders in early nineteenth-century Europe, like the Austrian foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, was to prevent future revolutions and maintain a favorable balance of power, an equilibrium that prevents one nation from dominating others.

In response to the Napoleonic Wars, during which Napoléon sought to create a Grand Empire that expanded French power over much of the European continent at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Metternich and his allies sought to contain France and restore order by establishing conservative political regimes.

To ensure that no single country could conquer others, they agreed to divide military and political power more equitably among themselves.

实力均衡思想是: 防止任何一个国家强大到能统治其它国家. 如, 用在拿破仑的野心身上.

'''

==  德国的”生存空间”思想

The ambition to expand eastward had motivated Germany for some time. The hunt for Lebensraum, or living space, had fueled its search for overseas colonies in the late 1800s and was an express goal of World War I. In the lands seized from countries in eastern Europe, Hitler envisioned German families settling and producing large numbers of children, supplanting the native Slavic populations. In this way, physically and culturally “superior” Germans would reclaim Europe from “inferior” Jewish and Slavic peoples.

Similar ideologies meant to rationalize the displacement of a territory’s residents by a supposedly superior population have appeared in history before, like Manifest Destiny in the United States and Japan’s expansionist policies in Korea and Manchuria.

一段时间以来，向东扩张的雄心一直激励着德国。对“生存空间”（Lebensraum ）的追求, 推动了 1800 年代末期德国对海外殖民地的寻找，这也是第一次世界大战的明确目标。希特勒设想德国家庭在从东欧国家夺取的土地上定居, 并生育大量儿童，取代当地的斯拉夫人口。通过这种方 式，身体和文化上“优越”的德国人, 将从“劣等”的犹太人和斯拉夫人手中夺回欧洲。

历史上也曾出现过类似的意识形态，旨在合理化所谓的"优越人口"对"当地人口"的取代，例如美国的“昭昭天命论”（Manifest Destiny）, 以及日本在朝鲜和满洲的扩张主义政策。

==  冷战时, (不太可靠的) 多米诺骨牌理论 : 共产主义影响会在一国向邻国蔓延

The first test of U.S. resolve to counter the forces of communism came in 1947 in an unexpected place—Greece. In 1946, following the triumph of monarchists in an election the Greek communists boycotted, civil war broke out. Communist forces sought the overthrow of King George II and his government.

1947 年，美国在一个意想不到的地方——希腊，第一次考验了美国对抗共产主义势力的决心。1946 年，君主主义者在"被希腊共产党抵制的选举"中获胜，内战爆发。共产党军队寻求推翻乔治二世国王, 及其政府.

The events in Greece worried the U.S. government. Neighboring Turkey was regarded as the gateway to the Middle East and its crucial supplies of petroleum, upon which Western industry and transportation depended. Truman feared that, should Greece become a communist country, a communist uprising might occur in neighboring Turkey as well. This belief—that the neighbors of communist countries would in turn become communist themselves—is known as the domino theory.

希腊发生的事件, 令美国政府感到担忧。邻国土耳其, 被视为通往中东的门户，是西方工业和运输业所依赖的重要石油供应来源。杜鲁门担心，如果希腊成为共产主义国家，邻国土耳其也可能发生共产主义起义。这种信念——共产主义国家的邻国,反过来也会成为共产主义国家——被称为"多米诺骨牌理论"。

==  冷战时, 杜鲁门主义 (1947.3)

The president’s pledge to help “free peoples” resist communist expansion, a promise that became known as the Truman Doctrine, formed the basis of U.S. foreign policy throughout the Cold War.

美国总统承诺帮助“自由人民”抵制共产主义扩张，这一承诺被称为"杜鲁门主义"，构成了整个冷战期间, 美国外交政策的基础。

In the immediate postwar period, Europe was the focus of U.S. anti-communist anxiety. The United States expended billions of dollars in Marshall Plan aid to stave off the expansion of communism there. It was in Asia, however, that the policy of containment was most strongly challenged.

战后初期，欧洲是美国"反共焦虑"的焦点。美国在"马歇尔计划"中花费了数十亿美元的援助, 来阻止那里共产主义的扩张。然而，遏制政策在亚洲, 受到最强烈的挑战。

Before World War II, the United States had demonstrated relatively little concern for the Middle East, which fell largely under British control.

Following the war, however, problems in the region, some of which stemmed from British policies and actions, threatened to move Arab and Iranian leaders closer to the Soviet Union. This possibility alarmed the United States and led to attempts to forge relationships with Middle Eastern governments. The nations that proved of greatest interest were Iran, Egypt, and the newly formed state of Israel.

第二次世界大战之前，美国对中东地区表现出相对较少的关注，该地区基本上处于英国的控制之下。

然而，战后该地区的问题（其中一些源于英国的政策和行动）, 有可能使阿拉伯和伊朗领导人与苏联走得更近。这种可能性引起了美国的警惕，并导致美国试图与中东政府建立关系。事实证明，美国最感兴趣的国家是伊朗、埃及, 和新成立的以色列国。

In the 1930s and 1940s, the United States had exercised a “Good Neighbor Policy” toward other nations of the Western Hemisphere, refraining from intervening in their affairs. The desire to contain communist expansion, however, led Washington to take a much more interventionist approach in Latin America and the Caribbean in the 1950s and 1960s.

In the eyes of the United States, Guatemala seemed to be drifting toward communism.

20世纪30年代和1940年代，美国对西半球其他国家, 实行“睦邻政策”，不干涉他们的事务。然而，遏制共产主义扩张的愿望, 导致华盛顿在 20 世纪 50 年代和 1960 年代, 对拉丁美洲和加勒比地区, 采取了更加干预主义的做法。在美国眼中，"危地马拉"似乎正在向共产主义方向滑移.

'''

==  “相互保证毁灭”策略

In the 1950s, both the United States and the USSR developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) as well.

Both the United States and the USSR quickly came to believe that the key to survival lay in building an immense retaliatory capacity, the ability to unleash devastation so great that the other side would never detonate the first bomb for fear of its own annihilation. In the United States, this defense policy came to be referred to as “mutually assured destruction” (MAD).

20世纪50年代，美国和苏联也开发了洲际弹道导弹（ICBM） 。美国和苏联很快就相信，生存的关键, 在于建立强大的报复能力，因为这种能力能够造成巨大的破坏，以至于对方因为担心自己的毁灭而永远不会引爆第一颗炸弹。在美国，这种国防政策被称为“相互确保毁灭”（MAD）。

'''

==  艾森豪威尔主义 (1957)

The Suez Crisis changed the U.S. role in the Middle East. After having had little involvement in the area, the United States now realized that Soviet involvement there was possible. Wishing to prevent this, in 1957 Eisenhower proclaimed the Eisenhower Doctrine, by which the United States would use its military strength to defend Middle Eastern governments in danger of being overthrown by the forces of “International Communism.”

苏伊士运河危机(1956), 改变了美国在中东的角色。在很少参与该地区之后，美国现在意识到, 苏联有可能参与该地区。为了防止这种情况发生，艾森豪威尔于 1957 年宣布了"艾森豪威尔主义"，根据该主义，美国将利用其军事力量, 来保卫面临被“国际共产主义”势力推翻危险的中东政府.
