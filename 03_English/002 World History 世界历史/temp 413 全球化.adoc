In many ways, World Wars I and II were only temporary interruptions in a centuries-long process of global integration. This process is often called globalization.

从很多方面来说，第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战只是长达几个世纪的全球一体化进程中的暂时中 断。这一过程通常被称为全球化

Although Britain supported the EEC’s economic goals, it was initially not interested in the political cooperation the group represented. When it did signal its desire to join, Britain wanted special protections for its agriculture and other exceptions for its Commonwealth connections, such as Canada. This meant negotiating with France, then the EEC’s most powerful member. Since decisions at that time were made unanimously and member countries had the power to unilaterally veto, France’s approval was crucial. President Charles de Gaulle of France did not approve, however. Over the next several years, Britain officially applied for EEC membership twice. Both times de Gaulle worried that admitting Britain, with its strong ties to the United States, would transform the organization into an Atlantic community controlled by Washington. Britain was admitted in 1973 (along with Denmark and Ireland), when de Gaulle was no longer president of France. It took a UK referendum in 1975 to confirm the country’s EEC membership.

尽管英国支持欧洲经济共同体的经济目标，但最初对该组织所代表的政治合作并不感兴趣。当英国确 实表示愿意加入时，它希望对其农业给予特殊保护，并为其与加拿大等英联邦国家的联系提供其他例 外。这意味着要与当时欧洲经济共同体最强大的成员法国进行谈判。由于当时的决定是一致做出的， 成员国拥有单方面否决权，因此法国的批准至关重要。然而，法国总统戴高乐并没有批准. 在接下来的几年里，英国两次正式申请加入欧洲经济共同体. 两次戴高乐都担心承认这一点英国与美国关系密切，将把该组织转变为由华盛顿控制的大西洋共 同体。英国（以及丹麦和爱尔兰）于 1973 年加入，当时戴高乐不再担任法国总统。1975年，英国举行全民公投，确认该国加入欧洲经济共同体。

By 1993, the EEC had been integrated into the newly created European Union (EU). The EU was conceived as a single market for the free movement of goods, services, money, and people. Citizens of member countries can freely move to other EU countries and legally work there, just as they can in their own country. In 1999, the EU introduced its own currency, the euro. The euro was not universally adopted by member states, though. The United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, and a few others kept their own currencies.

到 1993 年，欧洲经济共同体已并入新成立的欧盟（EU）. 欧盟被视为商品、服务、资金和人员自由流动的单一市 场。成员国公民可以自由移居其他欧盟国家并在那里合法工作，就像在自己的国家一样。 1999年，欧 盟推出了自己的货币欧元。不过，欧元并未被成员国普遍采用。英国、丹麦、瑞典和其他 一些国家保留了自己的货币。

In 2016, however, 52 percent of the citizens of the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. Many also disliked the fact that its membership in the EU made it easier for people from elsewhere in Europe, including recent immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, to enter Britain. Some also argued that losing the trade advantages that came with belonging to the EU could result in shortages in stores and more expensive products.

然而，2016年，52%的英国公民投票决定脱离欧盟. 许多人还不喜欢这样一个事实：英国加入欧盟使欧洲其他地方的人（包括来 自中东和非洲的新移民）更容易进入英国。一些人还认为，失去欧盟带来的贸易优势可能会导致商店短缺和更昂贵的产 品。

In Europe, the European Parliament, the EU’s legislative body, was angry that Brexit might threaten the entire EU project. To show its displeasure and possibly to deter any other member states from leaving, the European Parliament wanted the separation to be as painful for the United Kingdom as possible, and many member countries supported this hardline stance. In today’s post-Brexit world, there are new regulations on British goods entering the EU and no automatic recognition of British professional licenses in the EU. Britons seeking to make long-term stays in EU countries now must apply for visas.

在欧洲，欧盟立法机构欧洲议会对英国脱欧可能威胁到整个欧盟项目感 到愤怒。为了表达不满并可能阻止任何其他成员国脱欧，欧洲议会希望脱欧对英国造成尽可能的痛 苦，许多成员国支持这一强硬立场。在当今脱欧后的世界中，英国商品进入欧盟有新的规定，并且欧 盟不会自动承认英国的专业许可证。寻求在欧盟国家长期居留的英国人现在必须申请签证。

Among the forces driving European economic integration was a desire for Europe to be more independent of the United States.

推动欧洲经济一体化的力量之一是希望欧洲更加独立于美国

As a result, not only was it able to provide funds to war-torn nations to rebuild their economies and their infrastructure as part of the Marshall Plan, but U.S.-manufactured goods also flooded into markets around the world.

，作为马歇尔计划的一部分，美国不仅能够为饱受战争蹂躏的国家提供资金来重建其经济和 基础设施，而且美国制造的商品也涌入世界各地的市场。

It also encouraged some national leaders to seek regional international economic integration along lines similar to Western Europe’s achievement.

Beginning in the 1980s, the United States and Canada entered into negotiations to create their own regional free-trading zone. In 1988, the two countries agreed to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (Canada-US FTA), which eliminated barriers to the movement of goods and services between the two.

它(欧盟的出现)也鼓励一些国家领导人效仿西欧的成就，寻求区域性国际经济一 体化。从20世纪80年代开始，美国和加拿大开始谈判建立各自的区域自由贸易区。

1988年，两国同意《加拿大-美 国自由贸易协定》 （Canada-US FTA），消除了两国之间商品和服务流动的障碍。

Almost immediately, Mexico signaled its interest in creating a similar free trade agreement with the United States. Ultimately, Canada joined the plan with Mexico as well, and by the end of 1992, all three countries had signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The intent of NAFTA was to reduce trade barriers and allow goods to flow freely among the three countries. Despite considerable resistance within the United States, largely from industrial workers who feared their factories and jobs would be relocated to Mexico where wages were far lower, the agreement was ratified by all three countries and went into effect in 1994.

墨西哥几乎立即表示有兴趣与美国建立类似的自由贸易协定。。最终，加拿大和墨西哥也加入了该计划，到 1992 年底，这三个国家都签署了北美自由贸 易协定（NAFTA）。北美自由贸易协定的目的是减少贸易壁垒并允许货物在这三个国家之 间自由流动。尽管美国国内遭到了相当大的抵制，主要是来自产业工人，他们担心他们的工厂和工作 岗位会被转移到工资低得多的墨西哥，但该协议还是得到了所有三个国家的批准，并于 1994 年生效。

The creation of Canada-US FTA and later NAFTA represented an important policy shift for the United States. Until the early 1980s, the country had largely avoided limited regional trading deals, preferring instead to seek comprehensive global agreements. Such efforts had begun relatively soon after World War II in the form of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed in 1947 by twenty-three countries. Initially conceived as a way to reinforce other postwar economic recovery efforts, GATT was designed to prevent the reemergence of prewar-style trade barriers, to lower trade barriers overall, and to create a system for arbitrating international trade disputes.

加拿大-美国自由贸易协定和后来的北美自由贸易协定的建立代表了美国的重要政策转变。直到 20 世 纪 80 年代初，该国基本上避免了有限的区域贸易协议，而是更愿意寻求全面的全球协议。此类努力在 第二次世界大战后不久就以关税及贸易总协定 (GATT)的形式开始，由 23 个国家于 1947 年签署。关贸 总协定最初被认为是加强其他战后经济复苏努力的一种方式，旨在防止战前风格的贸易壁垒再次出 现，总体降低贸易壁垒，并建立一个仲裁国际贸易争端的体系。

In 1995, at the Uruguay Round, GATT transformed itself into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and cleared the path for free trade among 123 countries. Like GATT, the intent of the WTO was to support international trade, reduce trade barriers, and resolve trade disputes between countries. Unlike GATT, however, the WTO is not a free trade agreement. Rather, it is an organization that ensures nondiscriminatory trade between WTO countries. This means that trade barriers are allowed, but they must apply equally to all members. Many observers saw the creation of the WTO as a triumph of globalization, or the emergence of a single integrated global economy. China joined in 2001, a clear sign of its integration into global market systems.

1995年，乌拉圭回合谈判中，关贸总协定转型为世界贸易组织（ WTO ），为123个国家之间的自由贸 易扫清了道路。与关贸总协定一样，世贸组织的目的是支持国际贸易、减少贸易壁垒并解决国家之间 的贸易争端。然而，与关贸总协定不同的是，世贸组织不是自由贸易协定。相反，它是一个确保世贸 组织国家之间非歧视性贸易的组织。这意味着贸易壁垒是允许的，但它们必须平等地适用于所有成 员。许多观察家将世贸组织的创建视为全球化的胜利，或者单一一体化全球经济的出现。中国于2001 年加入，这是其融入全球市场体系的明显标志。

As the creation of the EU and NAFTA demonstrate, the signing of international trade agreements like GATT, which was ratified by countries on six continents, did not prevent regions from establishing their own free trade blocs like MERCOSUR, the South American trading bloc created in 1991. Nor have such blocs been confined to the West. The most notable to emerge in Asia are the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).

正如欧盟和北美自由贸易协定的创建所表明的那样，签署得到六大洲国家批准的关贸总协定等国际贸 易协定并没有阻止各地区建立自己的自由贸易集团，例如MERCOSUR （1991 年创建的南美贸易集 团）这些集团也不只限于西方。亚洲最引人注目的新兴组织是东南亚国家联盟（ ASEAN ）和亚太经济 合作组织（ APEC ）

ASEAN had its beginnings in the 1960s when Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand agreed to cooperate economically to foster regional development and resist the expansion of communism in Asia. By the early 2000s, it was openly advocating the creation of EU-style integration in the area.

东盟成立于 20 世纪 60 年代，当时印度尼西亚、马来西亚、菲律宾、新加坡和泰国同意进行经济合 作，以促进区域发展并抵制共产主义在亚洲的扩张。到2000年代初，它公开主张在该地区建立欧盟式的一体化。

APEC, launched in 1989, was in many ways a response to the growth of regional trading blocs like ASEAN and the EEC. It promotes free trade and international economic cooperation among its members.

1989 年成立的亚太经合组织在很多方面都是对东盟和欧洲经济共同体等区域贸易集团发展的回应。。它促进其成员之间的自由贸易和国际经济合作。

The growing global economic integration represented by the rise of the WTO and regional trading blocs opened new opportunities for multinational corporations (MNC) to extend their reach and influence around the world.

MNCs are not new. Some, like the British East India Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company, exerted great influence during Europe’s imperial expansion in the early modern and modern periods.

以世贸组织和区域贸易集团的崛起为代表的全球经济一体化的不断发展，为跨国公司在全球范围内扩 大影响力和影响力提供了新的机遇。跨国公司并不新鲜。英国东印度公司、哈德逊湾公司等一些公司在近代早期和近代欧洲帝国扩 张过程中发挥了巨大影响

Multinationals have also benefited greatly from the lowering of trading barriers around the world. In Mexico, for example, workers are paid lower wages than they are in countries like Germany, Japan, South Korea, or the United States. This translates to significant cost savings and thus higher profits for them. And because Mexico is part of a free trade bloc with the United States and Canada, cars made there can be exported for sale in the United States or Canada without the need to pay tariffs.

跨国公司也从世界各地贸易壁垒的降低中获益匪浅。例如，墨西哥工人的工资低于德国、日本、韩国等国 家的工人工资。美国。这意味着显着节省成本，从而为他们带来更高的利润。由于墨西哥是美国和加 拿大自由贸易区的一部分，在那里生产的汽车可以出口到美国或加拿大销售，而无需缴纳关税。

Between 1993 and 2021, the United States lost nearly eighteen million manufacturing jobs when some companies found it more profitable to relocate to Mexico. Not all these job losses can be attributed to NAFTA, but many can, as manufacturing that otherwise would have taken place in the United States was moved to maquiladoras, factories in Mexico along the U.S. border that employ people for low wages.

Workers in the automobile industry, once the backbone of the U.S. industrial sector, suffered as jobs and automotive plants were relocated to Mexico. Some economists, however, argue that the use of inexpensive parts produced in maquiladoras allowed the U.S. automobile industry to survive. Jobs in the clothing industry also declined 85 percent. There were simply fewer obvious advantages to keeping such jobs in the United States.

但从 1993 年到 2021 年，当一些公司发现搬迁到墨西哥更有利可图时，美国失去了近 1800 万个制造 业岗位。并非所有这些失业都可以归因于北美自由贸易协定，但很多都可以归因，因为原本在美国进 行的制造业转移到了美国边境沿线的墨西哥工厂，以低工资雇用工人。汽车行业曾经是美国工业部门的支柱，但随着工作岗位和汽车工厂迁往墨西哥，汽车行业的 工人遭受了苦难。然而，一些经济学家认为，使用加工厂生产的廉价零部件使美国汽车工业得以生 存。服装行业的就业机会也减少了 85%。将这些工作留在美国并没有什么明显的优势。(用外国低薪工人，本国企业主得利，工人失业)

The impression that NAFTA and globalization have brought poverty and misery to the working class in the United States remains strong and has influenced the nation’s politics since the 1990s. Responding to these beliefs, in 2017, President Donald Trump instigated a renegotiation of NAFTA, creating the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The USMCA included strong property rights protections, compelled Canada to open its dairy market more broadly, and required that workers in the automotive sector in all three countries be paid competitive wages. The agreement replaced NAFTA and went into effect in 2020.

北美自由贸易协定和全球化给美国工人阶级带来了贫 困和苦难的印象仍然很强烈，并且自 20 世纪 90 年代以来一直影响着美国的政治。为了回应这些信 念，唐纳德·特朗普总统于 2017 年发起了北美自由贸易协定的重新谈判，制定了美国-墨西哥-加拿大协 议( USMCA )。 USMCA 包括强有力的产权保护，迫使加拿大更广泛地开放其乳制品市场，并要求这三 个国家的汽车行业工人获得有竞争力的工资。该协议取代 NAFTA 并于 2020 年生效。

Companies in the developed world faced challenges rooted in the high cost of living and resulting high wages they had to pay to their employees. Globalization offered a solution in the form of outsourcing and offshoring.

发 达国家的公司面临着源于高生活成本以及由此导致的高工资的挑战，他们必须向员工支付高工资。全 球化提供了外包和离岸外包形式的解决方案

Those hired overseas experienced their own problems, however, because outsourcing often led to the rise of sweatshops, factories where poorly paid workers labor in dangerous environments.

然而，那些在海外受雇的人也遇到了自己的问题，因为外包往往导致血汗工厂的兴起，这些工厂的工 资很低，工人在危险的环境中劳动。

Even when MNCs commit to providing a safe working environment and fair wages abroad, the practice of subcontracting often makes this impossible to guarantee. Foreign companies to whom multinationals send work often distribute it among a number of smaller companies that may also subcontract it, in turn. It is sometimes difficult for MNCs to know exactly where their goods are actually produced and thus to enforce rules about wages and working conditions.

即使跨国公司承诺在国外提供安全的工作环境和公平的工资，但分包的做法往往使这一点无法得到保 证。跨国公司向其派遣工作的外国公司通常会将其分配给许多较小的公司，这些公司也可能依次将其 分包。跨国公司有时很难准确了解其产品的实际生产地，从而执行有关工资和工作条件的规则。

Millions of immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America have made their way into the United States over the last few decades. They serve an important role in the U.S. economy, often doing work domestic workers are unwilling to do. Many entered the country illegally and live and work in the shadows to avoid deportation. This makes them vulnerable to abuse.

过去几十年来，数百万来自墨西 哥和拉丁美洲其他地区的移民进入美国。她们在美国经济中发挥着重要作用，往往从事家庭工人不愿意做的工作。许多人 非法进入该国并在阴影中生活和工作以避免被驱逐出境。这使他们很容易受到虐待

In 2011, the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq was completed, eight long years after the invasion. Hopes that peace in Iraq would last were dashed, however, with the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a fundamentalist and militant Islamic group also referred to as the Islamic State. In 2014, it attacked Iraqi security forces and drove them from a number of cities, including Ramadi, Fallujah, and Mosul.

2011年，距入侵伊拉克已有八年之久，美国作战部队完成从伊拉克撤军。然而，随着伊拉克和黎凡特 伊斯兰国（ ISIL ）的崛起，伊拉克持久和平的希望破灭了，该组织是一个原教旨主义和激进的伊斯兰 组织，也被称为伊斯兰国。2014 年，该组织袭击了伊拉克安全部队，将其赶出拉马迪、费卢杰和摩苏尔等多个城市

ISIL leaders proclaimed themselves the heads of a new caliphate, an Islamic state led by a ruler claiming to be a successor to Muhammad, with religious and political authority over all Muslims. This is a claim most of the world’s Muslims reject. In response, a military coalition led by the United States returned to Iraq following a request by the Iraqi government. Meanwhile, ISIL’s counterpart in Syria, known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, waged war against both the government of Syria and other nonfundamentalist groups that were also seeking to oust Syria’s president Bashar al- Assad. The U.S.-led coalition that returned to Iraq to fight the Islamic State there intervened in Syria as well.

伊斯兰国领导人宣称自己是新哈里发国的首脑，这是一个由自称是穆罕默德继承人的统治者领导的伊 斯兰国家，对所有穆斯林拥有宗教和政治权威。这是世界上大多数穆斯林拒绝接受的说法。作为回 应，美国领导的军事联盟应伊拉克政府的要求返回伊拉克。与此同时，“伊斯兰国”在叙利亚的对应组织 “伊拉克和叙利亚伊斯兰国”对叙利亚政府和其他同样寻求推翻叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的非原教旨主 义团体发动了战争。以美国为首的联军返回伊拉克打击伊斯兰国，也对叙利亚进行了干预。

Instability in Iraq and Syria led to a flood of refugees making their way across the Mediterranean to Europe in 2015. Many others sought to escape failing states and poverty in numerous parts of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. These refugees and economic migrants felt they would find a better and safer life in the developed countries of the West, particularly Germany, Sweden, Britain, France, and the United States.

2015年，伊拉克和叙利亚的不稳定局势导致大量难民穿越地中海前往欧洲.

而其他许多人则试图逃离中东、非洲和亚洲许多地区 的失败国家和贫困。这些难民和经济移民认为他们会在西方发达国家，特别是德国、瑞典、英国、法 国和美国

Upon arrival, these groups met various responses. Others said they were fleeing circumstances outside the host country’s responsibility and would bring too many cultural and religious changes. For example, many Europeans feared that refugees from Islamic countries would reject the values of the largely secular European nations in which they settled. Many others believe that Muslims embrace political extremism or support acts of terrorism. Responding to the developing migrant crisis, German chancellor Angela Merkel declared, “We can do this!” and promised Germany would welcome 800,000 refugees in 2015.

这些团体抵达后遇到了不同的反应。一些人则表示，他们是在逃离东道国责任之外的环境，并将带来太多文化和宗教变化。例如，许多 欧洲人担心来自伊斯兰国家的难民会拒绝他们所定居的大部分世俗欧洲国家的价值观。许多其他人认 为穆斯林拥护政治极端主义或支持恐怖主义行为。针对日益严重的移民危机，德国总理安格拉·默克尔 宣称：“我们能做到！”并承诺德国将在2015年接纳80万难民。

Others throughout Europe felt it was short-sighted. They noted that since Germany was in the European Union, bringing refugees there effectively amounted to bringing them into any other country in the EU.

但整个欧洲的其他人却认为这是短视的。他们指出，由于德国 是欧盟成员国，将难民带到那里实际上相当于将他们带到欧盟的任何其他国家。

In Africa, borders charted to benefit imperialist powers often separated members of the same ethnic group into different countries while forcing hostile groups into the same country. Violent ethnic conflict has been a frequent result.

在非洲，为了帝国主义列强的利益而划定 的边界常常将同一民族的成员分隔到不同的国家，同时迫使敌对团体进入同一个国家。暴力的种族冲 突经常发生。

Indeed, they often have more difficulty responding to their domestic needs than countries that are relatively resource-poor. This problem, sometimes dubbed the resource curse, a term coined by British economist Richard Auty in 1993, makes resource-rich countries prone to authoritarianism, high rates of conflict, and low rates of economic growth. Resource-poor countries typically use citizens’ taxes for the majority of government funding, resulting in greater public scrutiny over how that money is used and governments that are more responsive to public needs. In contrast, governments in resource-rich countries are able to tap into profit-producing extractive industries like oil production to fund public expenditures. Because that profit is often quite large, opportunities for government corruption abound.

事实上，与资源相对匮乏的国家相 比，它们往往更难以满足国内需求。这个问题有时被称为“资源诅咒” ，这是英国经济学家理查德·奥蒂 在 1993 年创造的一个术语，它使得资源丰富的国家容易陷入独裁主义、高冲突率和低经济增长率。资 源匮乏的国家通常使用公民税收来支付大部分政府资金，从而导致公众对资金的使用方式进行更严格 的审查，并且政府对公共需求的响应更加迅速。相比之下，资源丰富国家的政府能够利用石油生产等 产生利润的采掘业来为公共支出提供资金。由于利润往往相当大，政府腐败的机会比比皆是。(谁支付你钱，谁是大爷。资源丰富国家，不太靠人民税收，所以也没必要听人民的意见)

The African country of Angola, rich in diamonds and oil, has struggled with the resource curse. In 2018, oil made up more than 92 percent of its exports, and the oil industry accounted for about a third of its GDP. Much of his power was derived from the oil rents paid to him by oil companies operating in Angola, which he used to oppress his opposition.

盛产钻石和石油的非洲国家安哥拉一直在与资源诅咒作斗争。 2018年，石油占其出口的92%以上，石 油工业约占其GDP的三分之一。(该国统治者)他的大部分权力来自于在安哥拉经营的石油公司向他支付的石油租 金，他用这些租金来镇压他的反对派，维持他对权力的控制.

As of 2015, approximately 85 percent of the world’s extreme poor (those living on less than $1.90 per day) lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and half of them lived in just five countries: India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ethiopia.

截至 2015 年，世界上约 85% 的极端贫困人口（每天生活费低于 1.90 美元）生活在撒 哈拉以南非洲和南亚，其中一半生活在五个国家：印度、孟加拉国、尼日利亚、民主共和国刚果共和 国和埃塞俄比亚。


Beginning in 1948, the United Nations (UN) established a series of universal declarations that conceived of all people as deserving of human rights and dignity (Figure 1.3). Three such declarations further affirmed the rights of women (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, also known as CEDAW, 1979), of children (The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959), and of people with disabilities (The Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, 1975). The UN regularly requires that member nations report on progress in these areas.

从 1948 年开始，联合国 (UN) 制定了一系列普遍宣言，认为所有人都应享有人权和尊严。三项这样的宣言进一步确 认了妇女的权利（《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》，，也称为《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》， 1979 年）、儿童的权利（《儿童权利宣言》，1959 年）和残疾人的权利（《残疾人权利宣言》， 1975 年）。联合国定期要求成员国报告这些领域的进展
