== The French Revolution 法国大革命 (1789.7.14 - 1794.7.27)

=== 革命爆发的原因

Inspired by the success of their North American counterparts, critics of absolute monarchical power and entrenched aristocratic privilege in France began agitating for change.

Like the battle for independence in the North American colonies, the revolutionary movement in France reflected a complex web of causes and consequences.

受到北美同行成功(即美国建国)的启发，对"法国绝对君主权力"和"根深蒂固的贵族特权"的批评者, 开始鼓动变革。与北美殖民地的独立斗争一样，法国的革命运动, 也反映了(其爆发有着)复杂的因果关系。

|-> 原因: 三个等级 (教士, 贵族, 平民) 的不平等

|At the core of revolutionary fervor in France was the traditional division of French society into three estates—clergy, aristocracy, and commoners—that reinforced the wealth and political power of the aristocracy and the church.

法国革命热情, 矛头指向的核心，是法国社会传统的三阶级划分——教士、贵族和平民——这种划分, 不公平地巩固了贵族和教会的财富与政治权力。(即三阶级制度在法国社会中根深蒂固，就是这种制度, 助长了不平等，成为引发革命的核心原因之一。)

In this system, which had emerged in the Middle Ages, the First Estate consisted of the Catholic clergy, who made up less than 1 percent of the population but held roughly 10 percent of French lands. Virtually exempt from taxes, the church derived substantial wealth from tithes (taxes of one-tenth of annual income) and fees imposed on the general population.

The nobility, who were the Second Estate, represented roughly 3–4 percent of the population but held upward of 30 percent of the country’s lands. They also dominated the most prestigious administrative, military, and judicial positions in the royal bureaucracy by virtue of their aristocratic status and were exempt from taxes as well.

The burden of paying taxes fell largely on the shoulders of the Third Estate, the remaining 95 percent of the French population consisting of peasants, the urban poor, the wealthy bourgeoisie or urban middle class who made a living largely through commerce and the professions, and everyone else who did not fall within the other two estates.

在这个中世纪出现的体系中，第一等级, 由天主教神职人员组成，他们只占人口的不到 1%，但拥有法国大约 10% 的土地。教会几乎免税，从"什一税"（年收入十分之一的税）和向普通民众征收的费用中, 获得了大量财富。

贵族即第二等级，约占人口的 3% 至 4%，但拥有国家 30% 以上的土地。他们还凭借贵族身份, 在皇家官僚机构中主宰着最有声望的行政、军事和司法职位，并且还享受免税。

纳税的负担, 主要落在第三阶层的肩上，该阶层由剩余的95%的法国人口组成, 包括农民、城市贫民、富有的资产阶级, 或城市中产阶级. 他们主要通过商业和职业谋生，并且不属于其他两个阶层的人.

French Inequalities. This cartoon of 1789 depicts the social inequalities and tensions that pervaded French society on the eve of the French Revolution. The First and Second Estates, a small minority of the population, controlled the majority of land and wealth, while the labor and tax burden fell on the Third Estate.

法国的不平等。这幅 1789 年的漫画, 描绘了法国大革命前夕, 普遍存在的法国社会的不平等和紧张局势。第一阶层和第二阶层, 只占人口的少数，却控制着大部分土地和财富. 而劳动力和税收负担, 则落在第三阶层身上。

|-> 原因: (第二等级的)贵族, 抵抗国王的征税

|After a series of poor harvests and the near-bankruptcy of the French Crown left many peasants and urban poor on the brink of starvation in the 1770s, resentment of the regime’s inability to provide relief led to extensive unrest and rioting. The Crown’s subsequent attempt to institute a land tax on aristocrats, who had previously been exempt from such assessments, resulted in broad resistance from social elites reluctant to surrender their traditional privileges.

1770年代，一系列歉收和法国王室几近破产，导致许多农民和城市贫民处于饥饿边缘，对该政权无力提供救济的不满, 导致了广泛的骚乱。国王随后试图对贵族征收土地税，而贵族此前是免征土地税的，国王此举遭到了"不愿放弃传统特权的社会精英"的广泛抵制。

|-> 原因: 三级会议中, 投票结构的不合理

|Equally problematic was the voting structure of this body, which gave each estate one vote. Since the clergy and nobility generally shared common interests, their votes typically defeated any initiatives the Third Estate might propose.

同样存在有问题的, 是该会议的"投票结构", 它赋予每个阶层一票。但由于神职人员和贵族普遍拥有共同的利益，他们的(联盟)投票, 通常会否决第三阶层可能提出的任何倡议。

|-> 原因: 受启蒙运动的开启民智, (第三等级的) 平民, 要求获得公平的政治权力

|Exclusion from political power was another issue leading up to the revolution. The Enlightenment’s emphasis on public opinion, natural rights, and freedom from tyranny also resonated with many educated commoners and aristocrats, who believed that political and economic reforms were desperately needed in France. However, the Estates General, a general assembly made up of representatives of the nobles, clergy, and commoners that was France’s closest approximation to a constitutional body, had not been convened by a French monarch since 1614.

"被排除在政治权力之外", 是导致革命的另一个原因。启蒙运动对"公众舆论"、"自然权利", 和"免遭暴政的自由"的强调, 也引起了许多受过教育的平民和贵族的共鸣，他们认为法国迫切需要政治和经济改革 (走法律程序的话, 要通过议会, 即法国的三级会议)。然而，三级会议是由贵族、神职人员, 和平民代表组成的大会，是法国最接近宪政机构的机构，自 1614 年以来, 就没有被法国君主召集过。

===  革命的过程

Demands for the reform of an antiquated system of government and social hierarchy reached a point of no return in the mid-1780s.

1780 年代中期，对"陈旧的政府体系和社会等级制度"进行改革的要求, 达到了无可挽回的地步。

In 1789, in an act of desperation, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates General to propose a radical reform of the economy and the creation of new taxes. But the Third Estate refused to participate until the king reformed the voting system.

After a period of stalemate, the Third Estate gained the support of many members of the clergy and met separately as a National Assembly. This act of political rebellion reinforced the sovereignty of the people, to which the king responded by amassing military forces with the goal of subduing the people by force.

His plan backfired, however, when a series of popular uprisings in Paris and throughout the country resulted in the commoners’ seizure of sites associated with royal authority, such as the Bastille, a fortress in Paris, land redistribution, and refusal to pay taxes.

1789 年，在绝望中，路易十六国王召集"三级会议"，提议对经济进行彻底改革, 并设立新税种。但"第三等级"拒绝参与，直到国王"改革投票制度"为止。

经过一段时间的僵持后，"第三等级"获得了许多神职人员的支持，并单独召开了国民议会。这种政治叛乱行为, 加强了人民的主权.

国王对此作出回应，集结军事力量，目的是用武力征服人民。然而，他的计划适得其反，巴黎和全国各地发生了一系列民众起义，导致平民占领了与王权相关的场所，如巴黎要塞巴士底狱, 土地重新分配, 和拒绝纳税。

The people of Paris captured the Bastille, a fortress and prison that had become a symbol of the monarchy’s despotism. The event is commemorated every year on July 14, France’s national holiday.

巴黎人民占领了巴士底狱，这座堡垒和监狱已成为君主专制主义的象征。每年 7 月 14 日法国国庆节, 都会纪念这一活动。

'''

===  颁布 <人权和公民权宣言> (1789.8)

In a position of strength, the National Assembly then issued the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

处于强势地位的国民议会, 随后发布了《人权和公民权利宣言》.

'''

===  颁布 “1791年宪法”

As a means of reducing monarchical power and enforcing the mandates of the Declaration, the National Assembly created a new constitution in 1791 and charged a newly formed Legislative Assembly with governing France as a constitutional monarchy and developing legislative reform.

作为削弱君主权力, 和执行《宣言》的一种手段，国民议会于 1791 年制定了新宪法，并责成新成立的"立法议会", 作为"君主立宪制国家"来管理法国，并发展"立法改革"。

The newly formed Legislative Assembly suspended the king and created a representative body known as the National Convention, which convicted Louis of treason.

新成立的"立法议会", 暂停了国王的职务，并成立了一个名为"国民大会"的代表机构，该机构判定路易犯有叛国罪。

'''

===  雅各宾派中的”激进派”和”温和派”之争

The National Convention was composed of a number of different groups of revolutionaries with conflicting opinions regarding what the government of France and French society should be like. A variety of political clubs and organizations expressed a range of ideas about the goals of the revolution and the best course of action to achieve them.

"国民大会"由许多不同的革命者团体组成，他们对法国政府和法国社会应该是什么样子, 持有不同的意见。各种政治俱乐部和组织, 表达了关于"革命目标"和"实现这些目标的最佳行动方案"的一系列想法。

Founded in 1789, the Jacobins quickly became the most influential of these clubs. The Jacobins sought to end the reign of King Louis XVI and establish a republic to replace the French monarchy. However, disagreements between their radical and moderate factions made consensus difficult to achieve.

Whereas the Girondins, a moderate faction of the Jacobins, some of whom hailed from the Gironde region of southwestern France, opposed executing the king, the radical Jacobin faction the Mountain, so named because its members sat on the highest benches of the National Convention, supported sentencing him to death.

After the Convention held a trial for the king, the Mountain ultimately prevailed, and the king was executed in January 1793.

"雅各宾派"成立于 1789 年，很快成为这些俱乐部中最有影响力的。雅各宾派试图结束国王路易十六的统治, 并建立一个"共和国"来取代法国"君主制"。然而，激进派和温和派之间的分歧, 使得共识难以达成。

"雅各宾派"中的一个温和派别--"吉伦特派"，其中一些人来自法国西南部的吉伦特地区，反对处决国王.

而"雅各宾派"中的激进派--“山岳派”, 则因其成员坐在国民公会的最高席位而得名，支持判处他死刑。

国民大会对国王进行审判后，山岳派最终获胜，国王于 1793 年 1 月被处决。

'''

===  罗伯斯庇尔 当政期 (恐怖时期, 1793-1794)

After declaring those who opposed the king’s execution enemies of the revolution, in 1793 the Mountain and their supporters initiated a period of violent repression known as the Reign of Terror.

在宣布那些"反对处决国王的人"为"革命敌人"后，"山岳派"及其支持者于 1793 年, 发起了一段被称为“恐怖统治”的暴力镇压时期。

Maximilien de Robespierre, a lawyer who championed the principles of equality, led the provisional government of France, known as the Committee of Public Safety, from 1793 to 1794. Under the battle cry liberté, égalité, fraternité (liberty, equality, brotherhood), this radical phase of the revolution achieved many progressive reforms, including controlling the price of grain, legalizing divorce, and abolishing slavery. Despite such achievements, however, it was also inherently contradictory, since tens of thousands of people were arbitrarily imprisoned or executed as a means of silencing dissent.

"马克西米连·德·罗伯斯庇尔"是一位倡导平等原则的律师，从 1793 年到 1794 年领导了法国临时政府，即公共安全委员会。在"自由、平等、博爱"（自由、平等、兄弟情谊）的战斗口号下，革命的这一激进阶段, 实现了许多进步的改革，包括控制粮食价格、离婚合法化, 和废除奴隶制。然而，尽管取得了这些成就，但它本质上也是矛盾的，因为成千上万的人被任意监禁或处决，作为"压制异议"的手段。

Despite its progressive reforms, the Declaration faced opposition from critics for failing to address women’s rights. In fact, France was the last of the major Western powers to extend voting rights to women, in 1944.

尽管进行了渐进式改革，《宣言》仍因未能解决妇女权利问题, 而遭到批评者的反对。事实上，法国是最后一个向女性授予投票权的西方大国, 在1944 年。

Disagreements between the Committee of Public Safety and the Convention over religious and economic policies hastened the end of the Reign of Terror as support for Robespierre’s repressive policies dwindled. By 1794, members of the opposition had removed Robespierre from power, and the Terror finally came to an end in July 1794 when its leaders, including Robespierre, were executed on the guillotine.

随着对"罗伯斯庇尔"镇压政策的支持减少，"公共安全委员会"和"国民大会"之间, 在宗教和经济政策上的分歧, 加速了恐怖统治的结束。到 1794 年，反对派成员推翻了罗伯斯庇尔的权力，恐怖统治终于在 1794 年 7 月 结束，包括罗伯斯庇尔在内的领导人, 被送上了断头台。

'''

===  督政府时期 (1795.10 - 1799.11)

The Convention then dismantled the executive powers of the Committee of Public Safety and sought to restore political stability by creating a constitution in 1795 that established a new executive council of five men known as the Directory. Despite the new government’s efforts to prevent rebellions and dissent, it faced a variety of challenges from radical Jacobins who wanted to restore the Terror’s revolutionary fervor and from conservative factions that sought to restore the monarchy.

Growing conflict between moderates and radicals, sharpened by a period of famine and economic difficulty, ultimately led the Directory to invite Napoléon Bonaparte, a charismatic and ruthless general in the French army, to help them develop a more authoritative government in 1799 and quiet the voices of opposition.

随后，"国民大会"废除了"公共安全委员会" 的行政权力，并于 1795 年制定了一部宪法，设立了一个新的五人执行委员会，称为“督政府” ，以寻求恢复政治稳定。尽管新政府努力防止叛乱和异见，但它仍然面临着来自想要恢复"恐怖革命热情"的激进雅各宾派, 和寻求"恢复君主制"的保守派系的各种挑战。

"温和派"和"激进派"之间的冲突日益加剧，加上一段时期的饥荒和经济困难，最终导致"督政府"邀请拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoléon Bonaparte）这位法国军队中一位魅力超凡、冷酷无情的将军，帮助他们在1799年建立一个更权威的政府，平息反对派的声音。

'''

===  拿破仑称帝时期 (1799-1815)

Following the Terror’s failure, the revolution took a more conservative turn, and the idealism of the French Revolution came to an end.

恐怖政策失败后，革命转向更加保守的方向，法国大革命的理想主义结束了。

The modern democratic tradition emerging in France then transformed into popular authoritarianism when Napoléon seized control. Although he safeguarded some revolutionary gains, Napoléon also reinstated slavery in France’s colonies and declared himself emperor in 1804.

Following a series of failed military campaigns stemming from his desire to dominate Europe, however, including a disastrous attempted invasion of Russia, Napoléon abdicated his throne in 1814. He then returned and led France again until his defeat by the British and Prussians at Waterloo (Belgium) in 1815.

当拿破仑掌权后，法国兴起的"现代民主传统", 转变为"大众独裁主义"。尽管拿破仑捍卫了一些革命成果，但他也在法国殖民地恢复了奴隶制，并于 1804 年宣布自己为皇帝。

然而，出于统治欧洲的愿望，拿破仑发动了一系列失败的军事行动，包括灾难性地入侵俄罗斯，最终于 1814 年退位。然后他返回并再次领导法国，直到1815年在滑铁卢（比利时）被英国和普鲁士击败。

'''

===  革命的后果影响与意义

The French Revolution now appeared to come full circle with the restoration of the French monarchy in 1814–1815. However, Louis XVIII, the restored French king, could not rule as an absolute monarch and had to recognize his subjects’ new constitutional rights to participate in government and regulate the king’s power. Notwithstanding Napoléon’s brief autocratic reign, the French Revolution successfully dismantled the nobility’s and clergy’s disproportionate share of power and defeated the strongest absolute monarchy in Europe.

随着 1814 年至 1815 年法国君主制的复辟，"法国大革命"似乎又回到了原点。然而，复辟的法国国王路易十八, 无法以"绝对君主"的身份进行统治，必须承认其"臣民参与政府", 和"规范国王权力"的新宪法权利。尽管拿破仑有短暂的独裁统治，但法国大革命成功地废除了"贵族"和"神职人员"过多的权力，并击败了欧洲最强大的"绝对君主制"。

Perhaps even more paradoxical was the contradiction between Enlightenment ideals of liberty that fueled the revolution on one hand and France’s ongoing colonialism, exploitation of slave labor, and discrimination against free people of color on the other. Except for a brief period during the Reign of Terror, France continued to uphold the institution of slavery in its colonies. Ultimately, then, the legacy of revolution in France was mixed.

也许更自相矛盾的是，启蒙运动的自由理想一方面推动了革命，但另一方面法国却持续维持殖民主义，剥削奴隶劳动，歧视自由的有色人种。除了"恐怖统治时期"的短暂时期外，法国继续在其殖民地维持奴隶制。最终，法国革命的遗产是好坏参半的。

==  共产主义诞生 (共产党宣言) (1848)

In 1848, Marx published The Communist Manifesto with his co-author Friedrich Engels. In the book, the two argued that “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.”

1848年，马克思与合著者弗里德里希·恩格斯发表了《共产党宣言》 。两人在书中认为，“迄今为止一切社会的历史都是阶级斗争的历史”。

These new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements.

这些新的自由民, 只有在他们被剥夺了自己的一切生产资料, 和旧封建制度所提供的一切生存保障之后 (即成为了无产者后)，才成为自己的出卖者。

'''

==  (日本) 明治维新 (1868)

In January 1867, Emperor Meiji (Figure 9.9) ascended the throne following the death of his father. In November, the reigning shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigned and relinquished his power, and in January 1868 the emperor officially proclaimed the end of the shogunate. The period called the Meiji Restoration was underway.

In 1869, the daimyo surrendered their titles and their land to the emperor. Although the daimyo were allowed to remain governors of their former lands, the samurai were no longer their retainers. Instead, they worked for the state. In 1871, the daimyo were removed as governors, and they and the samurai were given yearly stipends.

1867 年 1 月，明治天皇在父亲去世后即位。 11月，在位将军"德川庆喜"辞职并放弃权力，1868年1月, "明智天皇"正式宣布幕府结束。明治维新时期正在进行。

1869年，大名将他们的头衔和土地交给了天皇。 大名被允许继续统治他们以前的土地，但武士不再是他们的家臣。相反，他们为国家工作。 1871年，大名被解除总督职务，他们和武士转为每年领取俸禄。

==  早期的社会主义思想 (19世纪)

In Britain and the United States, the organization of unions developed independent of politics. In places such as Germany, France, and Russia, however, political ideology spurred the development of unions. The predominant political ideology that influenced their growth was socialism.

Today, socialism is a political theory that advocates the ownership of the means of production by the government. Socialism in the nineteenth century was somewhat different and took many forms. The only unifying features were a dislike of laissez-faire capitalism, a desire to improve the lives of the poor, and a belief that the government

在英国和美国，工会组织的发展,独立于政治意识形态。然而，在德国、法国和俄罗斯等地，(工会与政治意识形态, 关系紧密,) 政治意识形态刺激了工会的发展, 尤其是"社会主义"意识形态。

今天，社会主义是一种主张"政府拥有生产资料"的政治理论。但十九世纪的"社会主义"的含义有所不同，并有多种思想理论流派。唯一的共同特征是: 不喜欢自由放任的资本主义，渴望改善穷人的生活，并相信"政府应该负责解决资本主义和工业化引起的问题"。

'''

==  社会民主党 (社会主义派中的温和派)

Marx never attempted to put his philosophy into practice. However, during the period of the Second Industrial Revolution, many workers turned to his ideas as a basis on which to organize unions and establish political parties.

In 1864, socialists founded the International Workingmen’s Association (IWA) in London. Many different types of socialists belonged to the IWA, including Marx, and conflict soon arose over a variety of issues. Some socialists advocated the use of violence to effect change, while others advocated more peaceful, democratic means. Those who favored peaceful means are often called social democrats.

马克思从未试图将他的哲学付诸实践。然而，在第二次工业革命时期，许多工人转向用他的思想, 来作为"组织工会"和"建立政党"的基础。

1864年，社会主义者在伦敦成立了"国际工人协会"（IWA） 。许多不同类型的社会主义者, 都属于国际工人协会，包括马克思. 但他们很快就在各种问题上发生了冲突。一些社会主义者主张使用暴力来实现变革，而另一些社会主义者则主张采用更和平、民主的手段。那些赞成和平手段的人, 通常被称为"社会民主党人"。

social democrat : people who favor the creation of a socialist society through democratic means

社会民主党人: 是赞成”通过民主手段来建立社会主义社会”的人

'''

==  无政府主义 (社会主义中的另一派)

Another source of conflict among socialists was the role to be played by government in the construction of the ideal socialist state. Although Marx wrote of government eventually disappearing once class divisions had been erased and equality achieved, he also indicated that, until then, a government of the workers would be needed to manage society. Some socialists feared the existence of this new government would simply lead to the creation of a new group of authorities to oppress the people. They believed government should be abolished, an ideology known as anarchism.

"社会主义者"之间冲突的另一个根源, 是政府在建设"理想的社会主义国家"中所扮演的角色。尽管马克思写道，一旦消除了阶级划分, 并实现了平等，政府最终就会消失，但他也指出，在那之前，需要一个"工人的政府"来管理社会。一些社会主义者担心, 这个新政府的存在, 只会导致又建立一个新的当局来压迫人民。 他们认为应该废除政府，这种意识形态被称为"无政府主义"。

'''

==  法西斯主义 (大萧条时兴起)

On the pretext that certain actions were necessary for the good of the populace in this time of crisis, some leaders took advantage of the opportunity to impose authoritarian rule. This was particularly true in Italy, Spain, and Germany, which all embraced fascism in the 1930s.

(大萧条时,为了解决经济危机问题,) 一些国家的领导人以"在危机时刻, 为了民众的利益, 而必须采取某些行动"为借口，利用这个机会实行独裁统治。 在意大利、西班牙和德国尤其如此，这些国家都在 20 世纪 30 年代拥抱了"法西斯主义"。

Fascism was a political movement focused on transforming citizens into committed nationalists striving for unity and racial purity, to remedy a perceived national decline. To forge a unified nation, fascists espoused using violence, abandoning democratic norms and the rule of law to eliminate enemies real or imagined, and employing totalitarianism, the total control by the government of all aspects of a person’s life. The interwar period and the problems of the 1920s gave rise to disillusionment with democratic and parliamentary governments worldwide.

法西斯主义是一场政治运动，致力于将公民转变为坚定的"民族主义者"，努力争取团结和种族纯洁，以纠正明显的国家衰落。为了建立一个统一的国家，法西斯主义者主张使用暴力，放弃"民主规范和法治", 来消除真实或想象的敌人. 并采用"极权主义"，即政府对一个人生活的各个方面进行完全控制。两次世界大战之间的时期, 和 20 年代的问题, 引起了全世界(一些国家)对"民主议会政府"的幻灭。(事后证明, 是有点有病乱投医, 摸着石头过河, 有很多国家就掉坑里了, 陷入了"极权主义"的危害. )

The Nazis adopted nineteenth-century theories of the hierarchy of races that proclaimed the Germanic Nordic or Aryan races to be master humans.

纳粹采用了十九世纪的"种族等级"理论，宣称日耳曼北欧人, 或雅利安种族, 是人类的主人。(把人分成三六九等, 犹如蒙元将中国分成四等人, 汉人居底层.)

chatgpt: 这里的 Germanic Nordic 是指德意志民族中的北欧人，尤其是指在纳粹意识形态中被视为所谓“优等人种”或“雅利安人种”的一部分。纳粹将“Nordic”（北欧）种族和“Germanic”（日耳曼）文化结合在一起，认为北欧血统的人，特别是日耳曼人的后代，优于其他种族。
