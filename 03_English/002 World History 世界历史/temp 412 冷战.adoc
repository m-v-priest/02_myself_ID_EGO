At the Moscow Conference of 1944, which U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt did not attend, Prime Minister Winston Churchill agreed to let Stalin install Soviet-allied communist parties to control the governments of Romania and Bulgaria, which had been German allies during the war. In exchange, Stalin promised to leave control of the Balkans to the British. By the time the victorious Allies met in Potsdam in the summer of 1945 to finalize plans to partition Germany and its capital city of Berlin, Churchill no longer wished Stalin to exercise so much power in Eastern Europe. He warned the new U.S. president, Harry Truman, who was unaware of what had been agreed to at the Moscow Conference, of the danger of allowing the Soviets to control the region. But Stalin then consolidated his grip on Eastern Europe by placing a pro-Soviet government in power in Poland.

在美国总统富兰克林·罗斯福没有出席的1944 年莫斯科会议上，英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔同意让斯大林建 立与苏联结盟的共产党来控制罗马尼亚和保加利亚政府，这两个国家在战争期间曾是德国的盟友。作为 交换，斯大林承诺将巴尔干半岛的控制权交给英国。 1945 年夏天，获胜的同盟国在波茨坦会面，敲定 分割德国及其首都柏林的计划时，丘吉尔不再希望斯大林在东欧行使如此大的权力。他警告新任美国总 统哈里·杜鲁门(Harry Truman) ，让苏联控制该地区的危险，当时他并不知道莫斯科会议上达成的协议。 但斯大林随后通过在波兰建立亲苏联政府来巩固他对东欧的控制。

In March 1946, in a speech in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill warned his audience that “an iron curtain” had cut Europe in two, trapping half the continent under Soviet domination. This division of the world into United States–allied and Soviet-allied halves characterized the Cold War, a contest for ideological, social, economic, technological, and military supremacy that lasted until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The war was “cold” because it did not include actual fighting between U.S. and Soviet forces. (A “hot” war is a conflict in which countries engage in armed conflict with one another.)

1946 年 3 月，丘吉尔在密苏里州富尔顿发表演讲时警告观众，“铁幕”已将欧洲一分为二，将半个大陆 置于苏联的统治之下。冷战将世界划分为美国盟国和苏联盟国两半，这是一场意识形态、社会、经济、 技术和军事霸权的争夺，一直持续到 1991 年苏联解体。冷”，因为它不包括美国和苏联军队之间的实际 战斗。 （“热”战争是指国家之间发生武装冲突的冲突。）

The splintering of Europe that Churchill described deepened in 1948, when a government composed of both communists and non-communists in Czechoslovakia was toppled and replaced by an allcommunist government loyal to Moscow. In 1949, Hungary also came under the control of a communist party closely allied with the Soviet Union.

丘吉尔所描述的欧洲分裂在 1948 年进一步加深，捷克斯洛伐克由共产党人和非共产党人组成的政府被 推翻，取而代之的是忠于莫斯科的全共产党政府。 1949年，匈牙利也受到与苏联密切结盟的共产党的 控制。

The chief strategy of the United States in the Cold War was containment—an effort to confine Soviet influence to Eastern Europe.

美国在冷战时期的主要战略是遏制——努力将苏联的影响力限制在东欧。

The first test of U.S. resolve to counter the forces of communism came in 1947 in an unexpected place—Greece. In 1946, following the triumph of monarchists in an election the Greek communists boycotted, civil war broke out. Communist forces sought the overthrow of King George II and his government.

1947 年，美国在一个意想不到的地方——希腊，第一次考验了美国对抗共产主义势力的决心。1946 年，君主主义者在希腊共产党抵制的选举中获胜，内战爆发。共产党军 队寻求推翻乔治二世国王及其政府.

The events in Greece worried the U.S. government. Neighboring Turkey was regarded as the gateway to the Middle East and its crucial supplies of petroleum, upon which Western industry and transportation depended. Truman feared that, should Greece become a communist country, a communist uprising might occur in neighboring Turkey as well. This belief—that the neighbors of communist countries would in turn become communist themselves—is known as the domino theory.

希腊发生的事件令美国政府感到担忧。邻国土耳其被视为通往中东及其重要石油供应的门户，而西方工 业和运输业依赖于此。杜鲁门担心，如果希腊成为共产主义国家，邻国土耳其也可能发生共产主义起 义。这种信念——共产主义国家的邻国反过来也会成为共产主义国家——被称为多米诺骨牌理论。

The president’s pledge to help “free peoples” resist communist expansion, a promise that became known as the Truman Doctrine, formed the basis of U.S. foreign policy throughout the Cold War.

。总统承诺帮助“自由人民”抵制共产主义扩张，这一承诺被称为杜鲁门 主义，构成了整个冷战期间美国外交政策的基础。

The Marshall Plan

马歇尔计划

The U.S. effort to combat the expansion of communism also led to the creation of the European Recovery Program, named the Marshall Plan for Secretary of State George C. Marshall. In 1947, Marshall called for economic assistance to rebuild postwar Europe. Realizing the attractions of communism to impoverished, war-ravaged Europeans, Congress approved the Economic Cooperation Act in 1948 to pump an eventual total of $12 billion into Europe’s economy (about $147 billion today). The funds were vital in assisting Western Europe as a whole to rebuild their infrastructure and restore their industrial capacity. Because necessary materials often needed to be purchased from the United States, aid given through the Marshall Plan also helped ensure that the U.S. economy did not slide into an economic depression now that the war had ended.

美国打击共产主义扩张的努力还导致了欧洲复苏计划的制定，国务卿乔治·C·马歇尔将其命名为“马歇尔 计划” 。 1947年，马歇尔呼吁提供经济援助以重建战后欧洲。意识到共产主义对贫困、饱受战争蹂躏的 欧洲人的吸引力，国会于 1948 年批准了《经济合作法案》，最终为欧洲经济注入了总计 120 亿美元的 资金（今天约为 1,470 亿美元）。这些资金对于协助整个西欧重建基础设施和恢复工业能力至关重要。 由于必需的物资往往需要从美国购买，通过马歇尔计划提供的援助也有助于确保美国经济不会在战争结 束后陷入经济萧条。

U.S. aid was offered to all European nations, including Germany and the Soviet Union. Stalin, however, rejected it and forbade Eastern Europe’s communist-governed states within the Soviet sphere of influence to accept it. Instead, the USSR proposed the Molotov Plan, which gave aid to and established trade agreements with the communist nations of Eastern Europe: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet zone in Germany that later became the German Democratic Republic, commonly known as East Germany. Finally, in 1949, the United States developed the Point Four Program to provide technical assistance to industrializing countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia for improving their standard of living.

美国向所有欧洲国家提供援助，包括德国和苏联。然而斯大林拒绝了它，并禁止苏联势力范围内的东欧 共产主义国家接受它。相反，苏联提出了莫洛托夫计划，该计划向东欧共产主义国家提供援助并与其建 立了贸易协定：保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚以及德国境内的苏联占领区（后来 成为德意志民主共和国）被称为东德。最后，1949年，美国制定了“第四点计划”，向拉丁美洲、非洲和 亚洲的工业化国家提供技术援助，以提高他们的生活水平。

The tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union that had built up slowly through the later 1940s came to a head in 1948. Believing a strong Germany was vital to Europe’s economic recovery and a necessary bulwark against the spread of communism, the United States, Britain, and France planned to reunify the three zones of Germany they had occupied since the end of World War II. United, these zones would dwarf the Soviet zone in size, population, and wealth and, by sharing a single currency, play a major role in Europe’s postwar economy.

美国和苏联之间在 20 世纪 40 年代后期慢慢形成的紧张关系在 1948 年达到了顶峰。美国相信强大的德 国对于欧洲经济复苏至关重要，也是抵御共产主义蔓延的必要堡垒。英国和法国计划重新统一二战结束 后占领的德国三个地区。联合起来，这些地区在面积、人口和财富上将使苏联地区相形见绌，并且通过 共享单一货币，在欧洲战后经济中发挥重要作用。

The Soviet Union hoped to keep Germany disunited and weak and thus objected. In March 1948, it withdrew from the Allied Control Council that coordinated Allied actions in Germany. In June, the United Kingdom and the United States introduced a new currency, the Deutschemark, into their zones as well as into the western portions of Berlin they controlled, in order to dispense Marshall Plan funds. Infuriated, the Soviet Union cut off all ground routes into West Berlin. No food or fuel could enter the city by road, railroad, or canal. The Soviets planned to starve the Western Allies out, forcing them to abandon their sections of Berlin and thus their toehold within the Soviet zone.

苏联希望德国继续分裂、软弱，因此表示反对。 1948 年 3 月，它退出了协调盟军在德国行动的盟军控 制委员会。 6月，英国和美国在其管辖区以及其控制的柏林西部地区引入了一种新货币——德国马克， 以分配马歇尔计划资金。愤怒的苏联切断了通往西柏林的所有地面路线。任何食物或燃料都不能通过公 路、铁路或运河进入城市。苏联计划让西方盟军挨饿，迫使他们放弃柏林部分地区，从而放弃在苏联地 区的立足点。

The Western Allies unified their occupation zones to form the new country of the Federal Republic of Germany, usually referred to as West Germany, with the city of Bonn as its capital.

西方盟国统一了其占领区，成立了新国家德意志联邦共和国，通常称为西 德，以波恩市为首都。

The Western Allies then took another step to guard against potential Soviet aggression. In 1948, Belgium, France, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom had signed the Treaty of Brussels, forming a military alliance for purposes of protection against the Soviet Union. In 1949, shortly before the Berlin blockade ended, the United States joined those nations as well as Canada, Portugal, Italy, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an alliance for military assistance and mutual defense. Should one of the member nations be attacked, the others agreed to come to its aid.

随后西方盟国又采取了另一步骤来防范苏联潜在的侵略。 1948年，比利时、法国、卢森堡、荷兰和英 国签署了《布鲁塞尔条约》 ，结成军事联盟，以抵御苏联。 1949 年，柏林封锁结束前不久，美国与这 些国家以及加拿大、葡萄牙、意大利、丹麦、挪威和冰岛一起成立了北大西洋公约组织 (NATO) ，这是 一个军事援助和共同防御的联盟。如果其中一个成员国受到攻击，其他国家同意提供援助。

In 1955, when West Germany also joined NATO, the Soviet Union formed a military and political alliance of its own, the Warsaw Treaty Organization or the Warsaw Pact. Its other members were the communist nations of Eastern Europe: Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), formerly the Soviet occupation zone.

1955年，当西德也加入北约时，苏联也成立了自己的军事和政治联盟，即华沙条约组织或华沙条约组 织。它的其他成员是东欧共产主义国家：阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马 尼亚和德意志民主共和国（东德）（前苏联占领区）。

The Cold War in Europe. After West Germany joined NATO in 1955, the Soviet Union and other nations formed their own alliance, resulting in the creation of the Eastern Bloc. Yugoslavia, although a communist nation and considered part of this bloc, had officially divorced itself from Soviet control prior to the Warsaw Pact.

欧洲冷战。 1955年西德加入北约后，苏联和其他国家组成了自己的联盟 ，最终形成了东欧集团。南斯拉夫虽然是一个共产主义国 家并被视为该集团的一部分，但在华沙条约之前已正式脱离苏联的控制。

The Cold War between West and East was fought on many fronts with many strategies. Both sides provided aid and technical assistance to countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, many of which had been European colonies until the end of World War II. Through such aid, the United States hoped to contain the spread of communism by depriving countries of an economic reason for aligning themselves with the Soviet Union. Communism was attractive to many poor people.

东西方之间的冷战是在多条战线上进行的，采取了多种策略。双方向拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲国家提供援 助和技术援助，其中许多国家在二战结束前一直是欧洲殖民地。美国希望通过此类援助，剥夺各国与苏 联结盟的经济理由，从而遏制共产主义的蔓延。共产主义对许多穷人有吸引力

In 1949, the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb, ending the U.S. monopoly on nuclear weapons. In 1952 the United States took the next step, one opposed by some of the same atomic scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II, and developed the hydrogen bomb, testing it on the Pacific atoll of Eniwetok in 1952.

1949年，苏联 引爆了原子弹，结束了美国对核武器的垄断。 1952 年，美国采取了下一步行动，开发了氢弹，并于 1952 年在太平洋埃尼威托克环礁上进行了测试，但遭到了二战期间参与曼哈顿计划的一些原子科学家 的反对。

In the 1950s, both the United States and the USSR developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) as well.

Both the United States and the USSR quickly came to believe that the key to survival lay in building an immense retaliatory capacity, the ability to unleash devastation so great that the other side would never detonate the first bomb for fear of its own annihilation. In the United States, this defense policy came to be referred to as “mutually assured destruction” (MAD).

20世纪50年代，美国和苏联也开发了洲际弹道导弹（ICBM） 。美国和苏联很快就相信，生存的关键在于建立强大的报复能力，这种能力能够造成 巨大的破坏，以至于对方因为担心自己的毁灭而永远不会引爆第一颗炸弹。在美国，这种国防政策被称 为“相互确保毁灭”（MAD）。

In the immediate postwar period, Europe was the focus of U.S. anti-communist anxiety. The United States expended billions of dollars in Marshall Plan aid to stave off the expansion of communism there. It was in Asia, however, that the policy of containment was most strongly challenged.

战后初期，欧洲是美国反共焦虑的焦点。美国在马歇尔计划中花费了数十亿美元的援助来阻止那里共 产主义的扩张。然而，遏制政策在亚洲受到最强烈的挑战。

In 1951, representatives of the PRC and the Tibetan government signed the Seventeen Point Agreement making the region once again part of China, an event described by the CCP as the “liberation of Tibet.” In 1959, the Dalai Lama, the ruler of Tibet and leader of Tibetan Buddhism, fled to India with other members of the Tibetan government, who maintained that the agreement with China had been made under duress.

1951年，中华人民共和国和西藏政府代表签署了《十 七条协议》 ，使该地区再次成为中国的一部分，这一事件被中共称为“西藏的解放”。 1959年，西藏统 治者、藏传佛教领袖达赖喇嘛与西藏政府其他成员逃往印度，他们坚称与中国的协议是在胁迫下达成 的。

On August 15, 1945, the nation of Korea, which had been occupied by Japan during World War II and had been a Japanese colony for many years before that, was divided in half at the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude. The United States assumed responsibility for disarming the southern part of the Korean peninsula, and the Soviet Union took on the task of disarming the northern half. At the Moscow Conference held in December 1945, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union agreed that they and China would jointly govern Korea for a period of five years, after which it would be reunified and given its independence.

1945 年 8 月 15 日，朝鲜这个国家在二战期间被日本占领，在此之前多年一直是日本的殖民地，在北 纬三十八线被一分为二。美国承担了朝鲜半岛南部解除武装的责任，苏联承担了朝鲜半岛北半部解除 武装的任务。 1945年12月举行的莫斯科会议上，英、美、苏三国商定，与中国共同治理朝鲜五年，之 后朝鲜统一并独立。

Not long after the Moscow Conference, talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on how best to reunify Korea broke down. The two sides were too far apart ideologically, so in 1947 the United States handed the problem of Korean reunification over to the United Nations (UN). The UN General Assembly called for elections to be held in Korea, and a Temporary Commission on Korea was formed.

莫斯科会议后不久，美国和苏联之间关于如何最好地统一朝鲜的谈判破裂了。双方在意识形态上差距 太大，因此美国于1947年将朝鲜统一问题交给了联合国。联合国大会呼吁在韩国举行选举，并成立了 朝鲜问题临时委员会。

North Korea therefore refused to participate in the election. Given this opposition, in May 1948 elections to a Constitutional Assembly were held only in South Korea. A constitution was drafted, and the authoritarian anti-communist Syngman Rhee was elected president in July. In August, Rhee proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of Korea (ROK). Ten days later elections were held in North Korea, and a separate government for the new Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was established with communist Kim Il-sung as its leader.

。朝 鲜因此拒绝参加选举。鉴于这种反对，1948 年 5 月只在韩国举行了制宪会议选举。宪法起草完成，专 制反共人士李承晚于七月当选总统。 8月，李承晚宣布成立大韩民国（ROK）。十天后，朝鲜举行了选 举，新的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立了一个独立的政府，以共产党人金日成为领导人。

The Soviet Union withdrew its forces from Korea, and the United States moved most of its troops out as well. Without the forces of the two superpowers, border clashes occurred between North and South Korean troops from 1948 to 1950. Nort

苏联从朝鲜撤军，美国也将大部分军队 撤出。，没有了两个超级大国的军队，朝鲜和韩国军队在1948年至1950 年间发生了边境冲突。

On June 25, 1950, the Korean People’s Army (KPA) of North Korea invaded South Korea, confident of welcome. The ROK troops were unable to halt their advance, and within two days Seoul, the capital of South Korea, had fallen. The United States was taken by surprise. South Korea was not considered of vital importance to U.S. security. However, Japan was, and President Truman, in keeping with the domino theory, believed a stable non-communist Korea was necessary to protect Japan. Unwilling to see another Asian country fall to communism, he also feared U.S. reluctance to respond would send a signal to the Soviet Union that it was free to act aggressively in Europe, the area of greatest U.S. interest. Accordingly, Truman approached the United Nations asking for a condemnation of North Korea’s actions and requesting the assistance of member nations in South Korea’s defense.

1950年6月25日，朝鲜人民军满怀信心入侵韩国。韩军无力阻挡，两天之内，韩国首都首尔沦陷。美国 大吃一惊。韩国并不被认为对美国安全至关重要。然而，日本是这样的，杜鲁门总统根据多米诺骨牌 理论，认为一个稳定的非共产主义朝鲜对于保护日本是必要的。由于不愿意看到另一个亚洲国家陷入 共产主义，他还担心美国不愿做出回应会向苏联发出一个信号，表明它可以在欧洲这一美国最感兴趣 的地区随意采取侵略行动。因此，杜鲁门向联合国求助，要求谴责朝鲜的行为，并请求成员国为韩国 的防务提供援助。

The UN Security Council responded quickly. It condemned North Korea’s invasion of South Korea, and after a brief debate, on June 27 it issued Resolution 83, calling on the UN’s members to resist North Korean aggression. The Security Council’s actions could have been prevented by a veto of one its five permanent members: China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, since the Nationalists’ loss in the Chinese civil war, the United States had insisted that China’s seat on the council belonged to Taiwan, not to the People’s Republic of China, and the Soviet Union had boycotted the council’s meetings in protest. It was thus unable to stop the resolution from passing.

联合国安理会迅速做出反应。它谴责朝鲜入侵韩国，并在短暂辩论后于6月27日发布第83号决议，呼吁 联合国成员国抵制朝鲜的侵略。安理会的行动本可以通过其五个常任理事国（中国、法国、苏联、英 国和美国）之一的否决权来阻止。然而，自从国民党在内战中失败后，美国坚持认为中国在该委员会 的席位属于台湾，而不是中华人民共和国，而苏联则抵制该委员会的会议以示抗议。因此它无法阻止 该决议的通过。

The United States suspected the invasion of South Korea had been a ploy by the Soviets to test the U.S. response to an act of armed communist aggression. But Stalin had in fact warned Kim against it. Unwilling to start a war with the United States in Asia, he advised Kim to seek assistance not from Moscow but from Mao.

美国怀疑入侵韩国是苏联的一个策略，目的是测试美国对共产主义武装侵略行为的反应。但斯大林事 实上已警告金正恩不要这样做。由于不愿在亚洲与美国开战，他建议金正恩不要向莫斯科寻求援助， 而是向毛泽东寻求援助

The situation was reversed in September 1950 when U.S. troops led by General Douglas MacArthur landed behind KPA lines at Incheon. Seoul was swiftly retaken, and Rhee returned to power. With his original objective met, MacArthur was given a new goal: to reunify Korea under Rhee’s control if possible—and if the attempt did not lead to Chinese or Soviet intervention. Despite a warning by China that its forces would enter the war should the thirty-eighth parallel be crossed, MacArthur’s forces, with permission from the UN, did just that, chasing KPA troops northward toward the Yalu River, North Korea’s border with China.

1950 年 9 月，当道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟 (Douglas MacArthur ) 将军率领的美军在仁川人民军防线后方登陆 时，情况发生了逆转。首尔很快被夺回，李承晚重新掌权。在实现了最初的目标后，麦克阿瑟被赋予 了一个新的目标：如果可能的话，在李承晚的控制下统一朝鲜——如果这一尝试不会导致中国或苏联 的干预。尽管中国警告说，如果越过三十八线，中国军队将参战，但麦克阿瑟的军队在联合国的许可 下还是这么做了，将朝鲜人民军军队向北追击至朝鲜与中国的边界鸭绿江。

原本可能前往台湾的中国军队现在进入了朝鲜战场，并于 1950 年 10 月 19 日跨过鸭绿江。到了 12 月，中国和朝鲜军队已将联合国和美国军队击退，穿过北纬三十八度 线进入韩国。联合国提出的停火协议遭到中国军队的拒绝，朝鲜的严冬里战火不断。

China’s forces entered the fray in Korea, crossing the Yalu River on October 19, 1950. By December, Chinese and North Korean forces had sent UN and U.S. troops into retreat, back across the thirty-eighth parallel into South Korea. A cease-fire proposed by the UN was rejected by the Chinese forces, and fighting raged through the harsh Korean winter.

By July 1951, the war had turned into a deadly stalemate near where it began, along the thirty-eighth parallel. Both sides, exhausted, began to discuss peace on July 10. Negotiations dragged on for two years as the two sides fought to gain as much territory as possible before a cease-fire was finally proclaimed. On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. To prevent the recurrence of hostilities, a Korean Demilitarized Zone was established, roughly along the thirtyeighth parallel, to be patrolled by North and South Korean forces, and U.S. troops remained in South Korea as a deterrent to future North Korean aggression.

到 1951 年 7 月，战争在战争爆发地附近（沿北纬三十八度线）陷入了致命的僵局。双方都精疲力尽， 于 7 月 10 日开始讨论和平。谈判拖延了两年，双方为争夺尽可能多的领土而战，最终宣布停火。 1953年7月27日，朝鲜停战协定签署。为了防止敌对行动再次发生，大约沿着北纬三十八度线建立了朝 鲜非军事区，由朝鲜和韩国军队巡逻，美军则留在韩国，以威慑朝鲜未来的侵略。

Like many of the proxy wars of the Cold War, in which the troops of nations allied with the United States and the Soviet Union faced off against one another rather than risk direct conflict between the superpowers.

与冷战时期的许多代理人战争一样，与美国和苏联结盟的国家的军队相互对峙，而不是冒超级大国之 间发生直接冲突的风险。

China also suffered as a result of the Korean War. Now regarded by the United States and Western Europe as an aggressor nation, it too found itself isolated and dependent on the Soviet Union for assistance.

中国也因朝鲜战争而深受其害。现在，它被美国和西欧视为侵略国，它也发现自己被孤立并依赖苏联 的援助。

In 1954, the United States joined Britain, France, Thailand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand to form the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) to prevent the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia. The organization had no capacity to mobilize troops, however, and focused largely on trying to improve standards of living in the region, in the hope of making communism less attractive.

1954年，美国与英国、法国、泰国、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰组成东南亚条约组织 （SEATO） ，以防止共产主义在东南亚扩张。然而，该组织没有能力动员军队，主要致力于提高该地 区的生活水平，希望降低共产主义的吸引力。

Following the end of World War II, France wished to reclaim control of Vietnam, which had been its colony before being seized by Japan in 1940. However, the Vietnamese nationalist group the Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh, wished to seize the opportunity of Japan’s surrender to proclaim their country’s independence.

第二次世界大战结束后，法国希望收回对 1940年被日本占领之前曾是其殖民地的越南的控制权。然而，以胡志明为首的越南民族主义团体越盟 希望抓住这个机会日本投降，宣告国家独立。

Following its defeat in 1954 at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, France granted independence to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. According to the Geneva Accords, the peace treaty ending the war, Vietnam was divided along the seventeenth parallel of latitude with the assumption that, following national elections in 1956, it would be reunified. Ho Chi Minh governed the North.

The South was governed by a figurehead, the emperor Bao Dai, and his prime minister, Ngo Dinh Diem is a strong anticommunist.

1954年在奠边府战役中失败后，法国授予越南、老挝和柬埔寨独立。根据结束战争的和平条约《日内 瓦协议》 ，越南沿第十七纬度划分，并假设在 1956 年全国选举后，越南将重新统一。 胡志明统治北方。南方由傀儡皇帝保大和他的总理吴庭艳统 治。 吴庭艳是一位强烈的反共主义者

The Geneva Accords. As a result of the 1954 Geneva Accords, the French colony of Indochina was divided into separate nations: Laos, Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), and the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). North and South Vietnam were to be reunified following national elections.

日内瓦协议。 1954 年《日内瓦协议》的结果是，法国殖民地印度支那被 分为几个独立的国家：老挝、柬埔寨、越南民主共和国（北越）和越南共和国 （南越）。北越和南越将在全国选举后实现统一。 （

Ngo Dinh Diem had no intention of relinquishing power, however; he argued that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and so was not bound by them. In reality, he was a ruthless politician who allowed no opposition.

然而，吴庭艳无意放弃权力。他辩称，南越尚未签署《日内瓦协议》，因此不受其约束。事实上，他是一位残酷的政治家，不允许任何反对派

The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution

大跃进和文化大革命

In imitation of the Soviet model, Mao instituted a Five-Year Plan in China in 1953 and embarked on nearly seven hundred industrial projects, more than one hundred with the assistance of the Soviet Union. He also began the collectivization of agriculture by forcing peasants to labor together on state-owned farms instead of tending to farms worked by individual families.

毛泽东效仿苏联模式，于1953年在中国制定了五年计划，并启动了近七百个工业项目，其中一 百多个是在苏联的援助下进行的。他还开始实行农业集体化，强迫农民在国有农场一起劳动，而不是 照料个体家庭经营的农场。

Although the first Five-Year Plan was successful, the second Five-Year Plan proved a disaster. This plan, also known as the Great Leap Forward, began in 1958.

The proceeds of agriculture would fund industry. Collectivization efforts were intensified, and by the end of 1958 more than twenty-five thousand communes had been created, each consisting of several thousand families on average.

虽然第一个五年计划是成功的，但第二个五年计划却是一场灾难。这个计划，也被称为“大跃进” ，始 于1958年。农业收益将为工业提供资金。集体化力度不断加大，到1958年底，已创建了两 万五千多个公社，平均每个公社有几千户人家。

Communes were large units of production. Members worked together to grow crops in warm months and build construction projects during the winter. Food was prepared in communal kitchens, and everyone ate together in communal dining halls. Communes also operated schools and hospitals for their members. All tools, livestock, food, and other valuable items belonged to the commune as a whole instead of to individuals or families, and the commune’s leaders determined what work each member would do. Grain produced by communes in the countryside fed city dwellers and industrial workers. Communes began to exaggerate their grain production levels to win political favor. Even as they strove to grow more food, laborers were also ordered to engage in extra projects like dam construction.

公社是大型生产单位。成员们共同努力，在温暖的月份种植庄稼，在冬季建设建筑项目。食物是在公 共厨房准备的，每个人都在公共食堂一起吃饭。公社还为其成员经营学校和医院。所有工具、牲畜、 食物和其他有价值的物品都属于整个公社，而不是个人或家庭，公社的领导决定每个成员的工作。农 村公社生产的粮食供应给城市居民和产业工人。公社开始夸大粮食生产 水平以赢得政治支持。即使他们努力种植更多的粮食，工人也被命令从事水坝建设等额外项目。

Farm laborers were also ordered to produce steel in backyard furnaces hastily built in the countryside. To meet quotas, they stripped the countryside of wood and burned their own furniture to fuel the furnaces. In the end, the steel produced was of such low quality that it was worthless.

农场工人还被命令在农村匆忙建造的后院熔炉中生产钢铁. 为了满足配额，他们剥夺了乡村的木材并烧毁了 自己的家具来为熔炉提供燃料。最终，生产出来的钢材质量低劣，毫无价值。

The requisitioning of grain to feed the cities produced disaster in rural China.

征用粮食来养活城市，给中国农村带来了灾 难。。饥荒来临，人们吃树皮、树叶和粘土。一些中国历史学家认为，1959年至1961年 间，死亡人数为500万人，而西方历史学家则认为，有30至500万人死亡。

Deng especially began to reverse some of Mao’s more damaging policies by, for example, allowing peasants to sell grain surpluses. Given positive incentives to produce more food, the peasants did so, alleviating food shortages. Mao was sensitive to failure, however, and resented the successes of Zhou, Deng, and Liu. When Marshall Peng Dehuai, the Minister of Defense and a longtime associate of Mao, criticized his handling of the Great Leap Forward, Mao dismissed him from his position and replaced him with Lin Biao.

邓(小平)特别开始扭转毛泽东的一些更具破坏性的 政策，例如允许农民出售剩余粮食。由于受到生产更多粮食的积极激励，农民们这样做了，从而缓解 了粮食短缺。然而，毛对失败很敏感，并对周、邓、刘的成功感到不满。当毛泽东的长期助手、国防 部长彭德怀元帅批评他对大跃进的处理时，毛泽东解除了他的职务，并由林彪取代了他。 In 1966, Mao abruptly warned that “revisionists” were seeking to alter the direction of the CCP. He called on the younger generation of Chinese people—high school and university students and young factory workers—to engage in “class struggle” and save the revolution. In July 1966 he launched the event known as the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Students organized themselves into groups of “Red Guards,” guided by quotations of Mao that Lin Biao had gathered and published in a “Little Red Book.”

1966年，毛突然警告说，“修正主义者”正在寻求改变中共的方向。他呼吁中国的年轻一代——高中 生、大学生和年轻的工厂工人——进行“阶级斗争”并拯救革命。 1966年7月，他发起了被称为“中国文 化大革命”的事件。学生们按照林彪收集并发表在“红宝书”中的毛泽东语录为指导，自行组织成“红卫 兵”小组。

In August 1966, millions of Red Guards rallied in Beijing as Mao and Lin Biao encouraged them to purge the country of “bourgeois” elements by attacking the “Four Olds”: old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas. Red Guards then attacked and killed their teachers and school administrators. Provided with food and lodging at government expense, Red Guards rampaged through the country, destroying books, works of art, temples, monasteries, tombs, and historical sites. They beat people and forced them to confess to having bourgeois thoughts. No one knows how many were killed during the Cultural Revolution; it may have been as many as two million.

1966年8月，数百万红卫兵在北京集会，毛泽东和林彪鼓励他们通过破除“四旧”：旧风俗、旧文化、旧 习惯、旧思想，清除国家中的“资产阶级”分子。随后，红卫兵袭击并杀害了他们的老师和学校管理人 员。在政府出资提供食 物和住宿的情况下，红卫兵在全国各地横行，毁坏书籍、艺术品、寺庙、寺院、坟墓和历史遗迹。他 们打人，强迫人承认有资产阶级思想。没有人知道文化大革命期间有多少人被杀；可能有多达两百 万。

Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, who displayed insufficient revolutionary fervor, were removed from positions of power. In 1968, the Red Guards were themselves dismissed as Mao sought to curb their power. They were sent to the countryside along with other urban youth to learn from the peasants. In 1969, Lin Biao was named Mao’s successor. Two years later, Lin died in a plane crash while attempting to flee to the Soviet Union. He may have feared that Mao suspected him of plotting against him and planned to punish him.

革命热情不够的刘少奇、邓小平被撤职。 1968年，由于毛泽东试图遏制红卫兵的权力，红卫兵本身也 被解职。他们和其他城市青年一起下放到农村，向农民学习。 1969年，林彪被任命为毛泽东的接班 人。两年后，林在试图逃往苏联时因飞机失事身亡。他可能担心毛怀疑他密谋反对他，打算惩罚他。

In the aftermath of World War II, the nations of Europe speedily aligned themselves with either the Western or the Eastern Bloc, with one exception: Yugoslavia. In 1945, Yugoslavia’s monarchy was abolished, and Tito was recognized as the leader of the country.

第二次世界大战结束后，欧洲国家迅速与西方或东方集团结盟，但只有一个例外：南斯拉夫。1945年，南斯拉夫君主制被废除，铁托被 承认为国家领导人

Yugoslavia was a communist state from the beginning and was one of the founders of the Cominform.

南斯拉夫从一开始就是一个共产主义国家

Tito and Stalin clashed early on, however. Tito wished to incorporate within Yugoslavia the countries of Bulgaria and Albania, as well as parts of Greece, Italy, and Austria. Stalin opposed Yugoslavia’s claims. Tito, for his part, refused to accept a secondary position for Yugoslavia. Unlike the other members of the Eastern Bloc, Yugoslavia had liberated itself from the Axis without Soviet assistance. Thus, Tito believed it should be treated by the Soviet Union as an equal, not as a satellite state to which it gave orders.

然而，铁托和斯大林很早就发生了冲突。铁托希望将保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚国家以及希腊、意大利和 奥地利的部分地区纳入南斯拉夫。斯大林反对南斯拉夫的主张。铁托则拒绝接受南斯拉夫的次要地位。与东欧集团的其他成员不同，南斯拉夫在 没有苏联援助的情况下从轴心国手中解放了出来。因此，铁托认为苏联应该平等对待它，而不是作为 它发号施令的卫星国。

In 1948 Cominform expelled Yugoslavia. For assistance Tito turned to the United States, which helped Yugoslavia survive despite its inability to trade with its Eastern Bloc neighbors. Tito, however, was equally concerned about becoming a puppet of the United States.

1948年，共产主义情报局驱逐了南斯拉夫。铁托向美国寻求援助，尽管南斯拉夫无法与东欧集团邻国 进行贸易，但美国帮助南斯拉夫生存下来。然而，铁托同样担心成为美国的傀儡，

Among European nations, Yugoslavia’s refusal to become a member of either the Western or the Eastern Bloc made it an exception.

在欧洲国家中，南斯拉夫拒绝成为西方集团或东方集团的成员，这使其成为一个例外。

In April 1955 representatives from twenty-nine such countries in Asia and Africa gathered at a conference in Bandung, Indonesia. Their goal was to be able to rely on one another as they strove to industrialize and avoid the need to turn to Europe, the United States, or the Soviet Union for assistance. This aim formed the basis for the Non-Aligned Movement, an attempt by newly independent nations to stay out of the orbit of either the Western or the Eastern Bloc.

1955 年 4 月，来自亚洲和非洲 29 个此类国家的代表齐聚印度尼西亚万隆召开会议。他们的目标是在 努力实现工业化的过程中能够相互依赖，避免向欧洲、美国或苏联寻求援助。这一目标构成了不结盟 运动的基础，新独立国家试图远离西方或东方集团的轨道。

Indonesia assumed a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement. Both the United States and the Soviet Union desired Indonesia as an ally. It was a country with a large population, oil deposits, and a strategically advantageous geographical position. Both sides believed Indonesia’s future path—communist or democratic—would greatly influence the other nations of Asia. Accordingly, both courted Sukarno, and Sukarno accepted aid from both. In his eyes, so long as he did not allow either superpower to determine Indonesia’s affairs, his country was neutral.

印度尼西亚在不结盟运动中发挥了领导作用。美国和苏联都希望印度尼西亚成为盟友。这是一个人口众多、石油储量丰富、地理位置优越的国家。 双方都相信印尼未来的道路——共产主义还是民主——将极大地影响亚洲其他国家。因此，两人都向 苏加诺求爱，苏加诺也接受了两人的援助。在他看来，只要他不让任何一个超级大国决定印尼的事 务，他的国家就是中立的。(两头通吃，搞平衡)

By 1964 Sukarno had abandoned all pretense of neutrality and sought alliances with communist countries while encouraging anti–United States sentiment in Indonesia. In 1965, Suharto, a general in the Indonesian military, claimed that Indonesian communists had sought to subvert the government by plotting to kill Sukarno. Suharto’s subsequent destruction of Indonesia’s communists, carried out with the aid of the CIA, may have cost the lives of some one million people.

In 1967, Suharto removed Sukarno from office and assumed dictatorial powers. 到 1964 年，苏加诺放弃了所有中立的借口，寻求与共产主义国家结盟，同时鼓励印度尼西亚的反美情 绪。 1965年，印度尼西亚军方将军苏哈托声称，印度尼西亚共产党人密谋刺杀苏加诺，试图颠覆政 府。苏哈托随后在中央情报局的帮助下对印度尼西亚共产党人的摧毁可能导致约一百万人丧生。 1967年，苏哈托罢免苏加诺，独揽独裁权力。

Like Indonesia, India sought to plot its own path and remain free of the entangling alliances of the Cold War, and it was also one of the initiators of the Non-Aligned Movement. In 1947, the United Kingdom granted India its independence.

Exhausted from fighting World War II, Britain could no longer afford to maintain control over its colony. In addition, although the United Kingdom had sufficient troops there, the majority were Indian, and it was uncertain where their loyalties lay.

Finally, the United Kingdom’s greatest ally and creditor, the United States, pressured the nation to grant India its independence, as the United States had given independence to the Philippines following the war.

与印度尼西亚一样，印度也寻求走自己的路，摆脱冷战时期纠缠不清的联盟，也是不结盟运动的发起 者之一。1947年，英国给予印度独立。 由于二战的打击，英 国精疲力尽，再也无法维持对其殖民地的控制。此外，英国虽然在那里有足够的军队，但大多数是印 度人，他们的效忠对象是谁也不确定。最后，英国最大的盟友和债权人美国向该国施压，要求其给予印度独立，就像美国在战后给予 菲律宾独立一样。

The announcement that the British would be withdrawing sparked waves of religious violence throughout the nation. Much of it was caused by a dispute over what an independent India would consist of. Hindus in the Indian National Congress called for the maintenance of a single, unified India. Muslims, however, feared that the Hindu majority would dominate the government to their detriment, and many were reluctant to agree to such a situation. A compromise was reached, and at midnight on August 15, 1947, when India achieved its independence, the region of Pakistan, home to a Muslim majority, became an independent nation as well.

英国宣布撤军的消息引发了全国范围内的宗教暴力浪潮。其中很大一部分原因是关于独立的印度将由 什么组成的争论造成的。印度国大党中的印度教徒呼吁维持单一、统一的印度。然而，穆斯林担心印 度教徒占多数会主导政府，对他们不利，许多人不愿意同意这种情况。最终双方达成妥协，1947 年 8 月 15 日午夜，印度获得独立，穆斯林占多数的巴基斯坦地区也成为一个独立国家。

Before World War II, the United States had demonstrated relatively little concern for the Middle East, which fell largely under British control. Following the war, however, problems in the region, some of which stemmed from British policies and actions, threatened to move Arab and Iranian leaders closer to the Soviet Union. This possibility alarmed the United States and led to attempts to forge relationships with Middle Eastern governments. The nations that proved of greatest interest were Iran, Egypt, and the newly formed state of Israel.

第二次世界大战之前，美国对中东地区表现出相对较少的关注，该地区基本上处于英国的控制之下。 然而，战后该地区的问题（其中一些源于英国的政策和行动）有可能使阿拉伯和伊朗领导人与苏联走 得更近。这种可能性引起了美国的警惕，并导致美国试图与中东政府建立关系。事实证明，最感兴趣 的国家是伊朗、埃及和新成立的以色列国。

British actions laid the groundwork for another conflict in the Middle East following World War II. In 1917, Britain’s foreign secretary Arthur James Balfour had declared that Britain would support the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Throughout the 1930s, Jewish people from Europe had streamed to the region, and as their numbers increased, so did violence between them and Arabs, who demanded an end to Jewish immigration and the creation of an independent Arab state. Following the end of World War II, as Jewish survivors of the Holocaust sought refuge in Palestine, the British government requested that the United Nations resolve the issue. In 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine visited the region and recommended that it be divided into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The city of Jerusalem, sacred to both groups, was to be placed under an “international trusteeship.” In November 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted the committee’s suggestion with the passage of Resolution 181.

英国的行动为二战后中东的另一场冲突奠定了基础。 1917年，英国外交大臣阿瑟·詹姆斯·贝尔福宣布 英国将支持在巴勒斯坦建立犹太人家园。整个 20 世纪 30 年代，来自欧洲的犹太人涌入该地区，随着 他们人数的增加，他们与阿拉伯人之间的暴力事件也随之增加，阿拉伯人要求结束犹太移民并建立一 个独立的阿拉伯国家。第二次世界大战结束后，大屠杀的犹太幸存者前往巴勒斯坦寻求庇护，英国政 府请求联合国解决这一问题。 1947年，联合国巴勒斯坦特别委员会访问该地区，建议将其分为犹太国 家和阿拉伯国家。对这两个群体来说都是神圣的耶路撒冷城将被置于“国际托管之下”。 1947年11月，联合国大会采纳了委员会的建议，并通过了第181号决议。

About 250,000 Palestinian Arabs fled Jewish-controlled areas. On May 14, 1948, as the last British forces left the region, David Ben- Gurion, the leader of the Jewish settlement in Palestine, announced the founding of the nation of Israel.

大约 25 万巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人逃离犹太人控制的地区。 1948 年 5 月 14 日，当最后一支英国军队离开该地区 时，巴勒斯坦犹太人定居点的领导人大卫·本·古里安宣布以色列建国

Both the United States and the Soviet Union officially recognized the new state. Israel’s Arab neighbors did not, and they proclaimed that Arabs within Israel had a right to self-determination. On the evening of May 14, an air attack on the Israeli city of Tel-Aviv began, and the next day forces from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Transjordan (now called Jordan) invaded the country. The First Arab-Israeli War lasted ten months, with Israel emerging victorious in March 1949. Not only had it defended its existence, but it had also gained control of much of the territory the 1947 UN committee had recommended reserving for Arab settlement. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs left Palestine—now part of Israel—for neighboring countries.

美国和苏联都正式承认这个新国家。以色列的阿拉伯邻国却没有这样做，他们宣称以色列境内的阿拉 伯人拥有自决权。 5月14日晚，对以色列城市特拉维夫的空袭开始，第二天来自埃及、叙利亚、伊拉 克、黎巴嫩和外约旦（现称约旦）的军队入侵该国。第一次阿拉伯-以色列战争持续了 10 个月，以色 列于 1949 年 3 月取得胜利。它不仅捍卫了自己的存在，而且还控制了 1947 年联合国委员会建议保留 用于阿拉伯定居点的大部分领土。数十万阿拉伯人离开巴勒斯坦（现在是以色列的一部分）前往邻 国。

As well as weakening British power in the Middle East, Nasser, who became prime minister of Egypt in 1954, wished to make his country the leader of the Arab world, a position also sought by Iraq.

1954 年出任埃及总理的纳赛尔除了削弱英国在中东的实力外，还希望让自己的国家成为阿拉伯世界的 领导者，伊拉克也在寻求这一地位。

On July 26, 1956, Nasser, who had been elected president of Egypt the month before, nationalized the Suez Canal and immediately closed it to Israeli shipping. On October 29, Israel invaded Egypt, and on November 5, Britain and France did as well, touching off the Suez Crisis. The United Nations passed a resolution calling for a cease-fire, and both the United States and the Soviet Union demanded an immediate end to the invasion. All three withdrew, but Israel did so with the guarantee that it would be allowed to use the Straits of Tiran to send shipping through the canal. A UN peacekeeping force was left in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula to guard the border with Israel.

1956 年 7 月 26 日，一个月前当选埃及总统的纳赛尔将苏伊士运河收归国有，并立即禁止以色列航 运。 10月29日，以色列入侵埃及，11月5日，英法也入侵埃及，引发苏伊士运河危机。联合国通过决 议要求停火，美国和苏联都要求立即停止入侵。这三个国家(英,法,以色列)都撤出了，但以色列这样做是在保证允许使用蒂朗海峡通过运河运送船只 的情况下做出的。联合国维和部队驻扎在埃及西奈半岛，守卫与以色列的边境。

The Suez Crisis changed the U.S. role in the Middle East. After having had little involvement in the area, the United States now realized that Soviet involvement there was possible. Wishing to prevent this, in 1957 Eisenhower proclaimed the Eisenhower Doctrine, by which the United States would use its military strength to defend Middle Eastern governments in danger of being overthrown by the forces of “International Communism.”

苏伊士运河危机改变了美国在中东的角色。在很少参与该地区之后，美国现在意识到苏联有可能参与 该地区。为了防止这种情况发生，艾森豪威尔于 1957 年宣布了艾森豪威尔主义，根据该主义，美国将 利用其军事力量来保卫面临被“国际共产主义”势力推翻的危险的中东政府。

The withdrawal of Israel and the Western powers from Egypt augmented Nasser’s status as selfproclaimed leader of the Arab world and brought him closer to forging the pan-Arab state he desired.

以色列和西方列强从埃及撤军增强了纳赛尔自称为阿拉伯世界领袖的地位，并使他更接近建立他所渴 望的泛阿拉伯国家。

In 1958, the United States enforced the Eisenhower Doctrine by sending nearly fifteen thousand troops to Lebanon at the request of its Christian president, Camille Chamoun, to protect his government from political opponents, some of whom were pro-communist. Opposition was led by Lebanon’s Sunni Muslim majority, who had supported Lebanon’s joining the United Arab Republic when Chamoun had refused to do so. U.S. forces remained in Lebanon for three months while Chamoun finished his term. This diversion of U.S. attention convinced China that it could resume bombing Jinmen and Mazu without risking a response, precipitating the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis.

1958年，美国应基督教总统卡米尔·夏蒙的要求，向黎巴嫩派遣了近一万五千名士兵，以执行艾森豪威 尔主义，以保护其政府免受政治对手（其中一些人是亲共产主义）的侵害。反对派以黎巴嫩占多数的 逊尼派穆斯林为首，他们在夏蒙拒绝加入阿拉伯联合共和国时支持黎巴嫩加入阿拉伯联合共和国。夏 蒙任期结束时，美军在黎巴嫩停留了三个月。美国注意力的转移让中国相信，它可以恢复轰炸金门和 马祖，而不必冒做出回应的风险，从而引发第二次台海危机。

Although relative peace had returned to the region following the end of the Suez Crisis, also called the Second Arab-Israeli War, Palestinian guerrillas continued to strike at Israel from bases in Egypt and Syria. In April 1967, following air battles between Israeli and Syrian pilots, Egypt, under the false belief that Israel was preparing to invade Syria, removed the UN peacekeeping force from the Sinai Peninsula and amassed troops there. On May 22, Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, which Israel considered an act of war.

尽管苏伊士危机（也称为第二次阿以战争）结束后该地区恢复了相对和平，但巴勒斯坦游击队继续从 埃及和叙利亚的基地袭击以色列。 1967年4月，以色列 和叙利亚飞行员发生空战后，埃及错误地认为以色列准备入侵叙利亚，将联合国维和部队撤出西奈半 岛，并在那里集结部队。 5月22日，埃及对以色列航运关闭了蒂朗海峡，以色列认为这是一种战争行 为。

On June 5, Israel began the Third Arab-Israeli War by launching a preemptive strike on Egypt. Attempted attacks by Jordan and Syria were fended off, and Israel seized territory from these nations as well as from Egypt. The fighting ended nearly as soon as it had begun, earning the conflict the title of the Six-Day War. Israel had gained control of the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank (of the Jordan River) from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria, greatly enhancing the size of its territory.

6月5日，以色列对埃及发动先发制人的打击, 从 而引发了第三次阿以战争。约旦和叙利亚的企图袭击被击退，以色列从这些国家以及埃及手中夺取了 领土。战斗几乎一开始就结束了，这场冲突被称为“六日战争” 。以色列从埃及控制了西奈半岛和加沙 地带，从约旦控制了约旦河西岸，从叙利亚控制了戈兰高地，领土面积大大扩大。

On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria, which sought the return of the Golan Heights, launched a surprise attack on Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish religious calendar, when many Israeli soldiers were off duty. Once again, Israel was victorious. Israel had not lost any of the conquered territory, and in subsequent years Sadat was forced to engage in more peaceful efforts to seek the return of Egyptian lands.

1973年10月6日，寻求归还戈兰高地的埃及和叙 利亚在犹太教历中最神圣的赎罪日对以色列发动突然袭击，当时许多以色列士兵都在下班。以色列再 次取得了胜利。以色列没有失去任何被征服的领土，在随后的几 年里，(当时的埃及总统)萨达特被迫采取更加和平的努力，寻求归还埃及的土地。

Joseph Stalin died in 1953. In February 1956, at the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, Khrushchev denounced the late Stalin and accused him of crimes against the Soviet people. He then embarked on an aggressive process of de-Stalinization, changing Stalin-era policies such as censorship of the arts, releasing many whom Stalin had jailed for political reasons, dissolving the special tribunals that had convicted them, removing Stalin’s name from public buildings, and taking monuments to him down.

约瑟夫·斯大林 (Joseph Stalin) 于 1953 年去世。1956年2月，(苏联新任领导人)赫鲁晓夫在苏共第二十次代表大会上痛斥已故斯大林，指责 他犯有危害苏联人民的罪行。然后，他开始了积极的去斯大林化进程，改变了斯大林时代的政策，例 如艺术审查制度，释放了许多因政治原因被斯大林监禁的人，解散了对他们定罪的特别法庭，从公共 建筑中删除了斯大林的名字，并拆除他的纪念碑。

In the Eastern Bloc countries, this signaled the beginning of a political thaw. In June 1956, workers in the Polish city of Poznan rioted to protest food shortages and poor housing along with other grievances. In the autumn, protests began in other cities as well. They had a distinctly nationalistic character and called for such changes as the expulsion of the Soviet army from Poland and the removal of Russian language classes from Polish schools’ curricula. In October, Władysław Gomułka, who called for governmental reforms, was made the leader of the Polish Communist Party and thus the leader of Poland.

在东欧集团国家，这标志着政治解冻的开始。 1956 年 6 月，波兰波兹南市的工人们爆发骚乱，抗议食 品短缺、住房条件恶劣以及其他不满。秋天，其他城市也开始了抗议活动。他们具有明显的民族主义 特征，并呼吁进行诸如将苏联军队驱逐出波兰以及从波兰学校课程中删除俄语课程等变革。 10月，呼 吁政府改革的瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡被任命为波兰共产党领导人，从而成为波兰领导人。

After Gomułka assured Khrushchev that he had no intention of ending communism or Poland’s relationship with the Soviet Union, Khrushchev agreed that reforms could take place. Accordingly, the collectivization of Polish agriculture was ended, Soviet advisers were sent home, political prisoners were released, and greater freedom was given to the Roman Catholic Church.

在哥穆尔卡向赫鲁晓夫保证他无意结束共产主义或波兰与苏联的关系后， 赫鲁晓夫同意可以进行改革。因此，波兰农业的集体化结束了，苏联顾问被遣送回国，政治犯被释 放，罗马天主教会获得了更大的自由。

The success of the Poles inspired others. On October 23, 1956, students marched through the streets of Budapest, Hungary, demanding among other things the removal of Stalinist symbols, improvements in wages, economic reforms, and the removal of Soviet troops from the country. The State Security Police opened fire on students who gathered outside the main radio station to read their demands on the air, and several were killed. An uprising began, with angry citizens fighting both the police and Soviet troops. As protesters attacked the parliament building, Ernő Gerő, the head of the ruling Hungarian Working People’s Party and leader of the country, fled along with his prime minister, András Hegedüs. Imre Nagy, a reformer, took office as prime minister. Unlike Gomułka, Nagy did not wish to institute internal reforms while otherwise remaining loyal to Moscow. On October 28, he called for a cease-fire, dissolved the State Security Police, and demanded that Soviet troops leave Budapest. On November 1, Nagy announced that Hungary was no longer a member of the Warsaw Pact and would remain neutral in international affairs.

波兰人的成功激励了其他人。 1956 年 10 月 23 日，学生在匈牙利布达佩斯街头游行，要求消除斯大 林主义标志、提高工资、经济改革以及从该国撤出苏联军队等。国家安全警察向聚集在主要广播电台 外宣读要求的学生开枪，造成数人死亡。起义开始了，愤怒的公民与警察和苏联军队作战。当抗议者 袭击议会大楼时，执政的匈牙利劳动人民党党魁兼国家领导人埃尔诺·格尔诺与总理安德拉斯·赫格杜斯 一起逃离。改革家伊姆雷·纳吉就任总理。与哥穆尔卡不同，纳吉不希望在保持对莫斯科忠诚的同时进 行内部改革。 10月28日，他呼吁停火，解散国家安全警察，并要求苏联军队离开布达佩斯。 11月1 日，纳吉宣布匈牙利不再是华约成员国，在国际事务中保持中立。

Three days later, Soviet forces entered Hungary to join those the USSR had been on the point of withdrawing until Nagy’s announcement. Khrushchev may have feared that Nagy’s declaration of Hungarian neutrality threatened the security of the Soviet Union. He may also have wished to demonstrate his resolve to more conservative communists and to the leaders of the other Soviet states. Some argue that the Western Bloc’s failure to intervene emboldened him. The uprising came to an end on November 10 after about 2,500 Hungarians had been killed, and the communist government was reestablished under János Kádár. Approximately twenty thousand Hungarians were arrested and another 200,000 fled the country. Soviet troops were permanently stationed in Hungary, and Nagy was tried and executed in 1958.

三天后，苏联军队进入匈牙利，与纳吉宣布之前苏联准备撤军的部队会合。赫鲁晓夫可能担心纳吉宣 布匈牙利中立会威胁到苏联的安全。他可能还希望向更保守的共产主义者和其他苏联国家的领导人展 示他的决心。一些人认为，西方集团未能进行干预让他更加大胆。约 2,500 名匈牙利人被杀后，起义 于 11 月 10 日结束，亚诺什·卡达尔 (János Kádár) 领导下的共产主义政府得以重建。大约两万名匈牙 利人被捕，另有二十万人逃离该国。苏联军队永久驻扎在匈牙利，纳吉于 1958 年受审并被处决。

The United States did not become involved in the events in Hungary, a decision Khrushchev later mocked.

美国没有介入匈牙利的事件，赫鲁晓夫后来嘲笑了这一决定。

The capitalist part of the old German capital was a thorn in Khrushchev’s side. Not only did its prosperity arouse discontent among the residents of the communist eastern districts, but the openness allowed there enabled many people from East Germany—and elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc—to escape to freedom.

德国旧首都的资本主义部分是赫鲁晓夫的眼 中钉。它的繁荣不仅引起了共产主义东部地区居民的不满，而且开放性使得许多来自东德和东欧集团 其他地区的人们得以逃亡到自由。

On the evening of August 12–13, 1961, East German troops erected a barbed wire fence to divide the western part of Berlin from the eastern. In the days that followed, cement walls went up as well to stop the free passage from east to west. On October 22, a dispute erupted between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the free passage of U.S. government employees between East and West Berlin. The United States maintained that, in keeping with agreements reached at Potsdam at the end of World War II, members of the Allies could travel freely throughout Berlin.

1961年8月12日至13日晚，东德军队竖起铁丝网，将柏林西部与东部分开。接下来的日子里，水泥墙 也拔地而起，阻止了从东到西的自由通道。 10月22日，美国和苏联就美国政府雇员在东柏林和西柏林 之间的自由通行问题爆发争端。美国坚称，根据二战结束时在波茨坦达成的协议，盟军成员可以在柏 林各地自由旅行。

The Berlin Wall separated the residents of East and West Berlin from 1961 until it was destroyed in 1989.

柏林墙从 1961 年起将东柏林和西柏林的居民分隔开，直到 1989 年被摧毁。

Tensions flared in Europe yet again in 1968 when Czechoslovakia, like Poland and Hungary before it, sought to loosen its ties to the Soviet Union. Early in the year, the country’s conservative leader Antonín Novotný was replaced by Alexander Dubček. Dubček instituted economic reforms and ended government censorship. As Czechs called for even greater reforms, the Soviet Union became alarmed, as it had in Poland and Hungary in 1956. Fearing that changes in Czechoslovakia would stimulate calls for reform elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc or in the Soviet republics themselves—and confident the United States would not intervene, just as it had failed to do before—the new Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev ordered an invasion of Czechoslovakia on August 20, 1968. By early 1969, resistance had largely disappeared, and the Soviet Union replaced Dubček with the conservative Gustáv Husák, who reversed Dubček’s reforms. Censorship was restored, and government control increased again.

1968年，欧洲的紧张局势再次爆发，当时捷克斯洛伐克像之前的波兰和匈牙利一样，试图放松与苏联 的关系。今年年初，该国保守派领导人安东尼·诺沃特尼 (Antonín Novotný) 被亚历山大·杜布切克 (Alexander Dubček) 取代。杜布切克实施了经济改革并结束了政府审查制度。当捷克人呼吁进行更大规 模的改革时，苏联感到震惊，就像 1956 年对波兰和匈牙利那样。担心捷克斯洛伐克的变化会刺激东欧 集团其他地方或苏联加盟共和国本身的改革呼声，并相信美国国家不会进行干预，就像以前未能做到 的那样——新任苏联领导人列昂尼德·勃列日涅夫于 1968 年 8 月 20 日下令入侵捷克斯洛伐克。到 1969 年初，抵抗已基本消失，苏联用保守派古斯塔夫取代了杜布切克胡萨克推翻了杜布切克的改革。 审查制度恢复，政府控制再次加强。

In the 1930s and 1940s, the United States had exercised a “Good Neighbor Policy” toward other nations of the Western Hemisphere, refraining from intervening in their affairs. The desire to contain communist expansion, however, led Washington to take a much more interventionist approach in Latin America and the Caribbean in the 1950s and 1960s.

In the eyes of the United States, Guatemala seemed to be drifting toward communism.

20世纪30年代和1940年代，美国对西半球其他国家实行“睦邻政策”，不干涉他们的事务。然而，遏制 共产主义扩张的愿望导致华盛顿在 20 世纪 50 年代和 1960 年代对拉丁美洲和加勒比地区采取了更加 干预主义的做法。在美国 眼中，危地马拉似乎正在向共产主义方向漂移.

Earlier that year, the United States had placed missiles in Turkey. Khrushchev was angered, but now he offered Kennedy a way out of the Cuban stalemate: if the missiles in Turkey were removed, those in Cuba would be too. Kennedy accepted the offer.

(the Cuban Missile Crisis 古巴导弹危机时,) 那年早些时候，美国在土耳其部署了导弹。赫鲁晓夫很生气，但现在他向肯尼迪提供了一条摆脱古巴 僵局的出路：如果土耳其的导弹被拆除，古巴的导弹也会被拆除。肯尼迪接受了这个提议。

Following the standoff, a direct telephone hotline was established between Washington and Moscow to enable instant communications between the leaders of the two rival nations. The dangers of nuclear war did not necessarily diminish, however. Thwarted in their attempt to place nuclear missiles in Cuba, the Soviets focused on the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, which could strike the United States from Europe.

对峙之后，华盛顿和莫斯科之间建立了直接电话热线，以便两个敌对国家的领导人之间能够进行即时 通信。然而，核战争的危险并不一定减少。苏联在古巴部署核导弹的尝试遭到挫败，转而专注于开发 洲际弹道导弹，这种导弹可以从欧洲打击美国。

In China, Mao Zedong had criticized the Soviets for being insufficiently supportive of socialist revolution around the world. So Khrushchev’s willingness to back down when confronted by the United States and to seemingly abandon Cuba gave credence to Mao’s claims. It also improved Mao’s position within the Chinese Communist Party. The humiliation of the Soviets now weakened the position of those members, such as Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Conversely, Khrushchev’s power was seriously damaged by the Cuban Missile Crisis, and two years later he was forced from office.

在中国，毛泽东曾批评苏联对世界各地社会主义革命的支持不够。因此，赫鲁晓夫在美国面前做出让 步并看似放弃古巴的意愿证实了毛泽东的主张。这也提高了毛泽东在中国共产党内的地位。苏联的屈辱现在削弱了刘少奇和邓小平等成员的地位。相反，赫鲁晓夫的权力因 古巴导弹危机而严重受损，两年后被迫下台。

The country was afterward governed by a succession of leaders; none were effective or earned the loyalty of the population. All were maintained in power by the United States, which proved willing to support any politician promising to take a hard line against communism and continue the war against North Vietnam.

(南越吴廷琰被暗杀后, )该国后来由一系列领导人统治。没有一个是有效的或赢得了民众的忠 诚。所有这些国家都由美国维持权力，事实证明美国愿意支持任何承诺对共产主义采取强硬路线并继 续对北越发动战争的政客。

By the early 1970s, the United States was seeking a way to escape the situation in Vietnam. President Richard Nixon did not wish to simply withdraw, however. Instead, a peace agreement would have to be reached. North Vietnam had been reluctant to negotiate on U.S. terms.

到 20 世纪 70 年代初，美国正在寻找摆脱越南局势的方法。然而，理查德·尼克松总统并不想简单地退 出。相反，必须达成和平协议。北越一直不愿按照美国的条件进行谈判

The Sino-Soviet Split

中苏分裂

In Mao’s eyes, he himself, not Khrushchev, should be the leader of world communism.

在毛泽东看来，世界共产主义的 领导人应该是他本人，而不是赫鲁晓夫。

Indeed, far from being anti-imperialist, the Soviets had created their own empire in Europe.

事实上，苏联非但没有反帝国主义，反而在欧洲建立了自己的帝国。

The United States was eager to capitalize on the Sino-Soviet split in hopes of securing several advantages. In 1972 Nixon visited China, the first sitting U.S. president to do so, and met with Mao. This effort to improve U.S. relations with China threatened to isolate the Soviet Union, so in turn the Soviets agreed to hold a Moscow Summit meeting between Brezhnev and Nixon in May 1972. The United States then used the Soviet desire for closer relations to exert pressure on North Vietnam. In March 1972, after the North launched an offensive against the South, Nixon threatened to call off the Moscow Summit if the Soviets did not force North Vietnam to the peace table.

美国急于利用中苏分裂，希望获得多项优势。 1972年，尼克松访华，成为首位访华的美国在任总统， 并会见了毛泽东。改善美中关系的努力可能会孤立苏联，因此苏联同意于 1972 年 5 月举行勃列日涅夫 和尼克松的莫斯科峰会。美国随后利用苏联希望建立更密切关系的愿望向苏联施加压力。北越。 1972 年 3 月，朝鲜对南方发动攻势后，尼克松威胁称，如果苏联不迫使北越回到和平谈判桌，他将取消莫 斯科峰会。

In the end, the United States’ efforts to extricate itself from the war were successful. At the peace talks in Paris, North Vietnam and the United States agreed to the U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam in 1973. The war continued until 1975, however, when North Vietnam defeated South Vietnam, and the country was reunified under a communist government.

最终，美国摆脱战争的努力获得了成功。 1973年，在巴黎和谈中，北越和美国同意美国从南越撤军。 然而，战争一直持续到1975年，北越击败了南越，国家在共产党政府的领导下实现了统一

Throughout much of the war in Vietnam, Cambodia had been neutral. In 1970, however, its ruler Prince Sihanouk was deposed by one of his generals, Lon Nol, who favored the United States. Sihanouk then allied himself with the Cambodian communist group, the Khmer Rouge. In 1975, after years of fighting, the Khmer Rouge overthrew the government of Lon Nol.

在越南战争的大部分时间里，柬埔 寨一直保持中立。然而，1970 年，其统治者西哈努克亲王被他的一位亲美将军朗诺 (Lon Nol)废黜。西 哈努克随后与柬埔寨共产主义组织红色高棉结盟。 1975年，经过多年的战斗，红色高棉推翻了朗诺政 府。

Under the rule of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader and an admirer of Mao Zedong, Cambodia embarked on a program to rebuild itself as the perfect communist state. The Khmer Rouge seized private property and forced city dwellers to relocate to the countryside. The population was made to labor in work camps and on collective farms, and some died as a result of disease and starvation. Those who were unable to work were killed. The Khmer Rouge also carried out a deliberate campaign of extermination against professionals, intellectuals (which could mean anyone who wore glasses), Christians, Muslims, Buddhist monks, and people of Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese ancestry. By the time the killing ended with the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam in 1978, some three million people, approximately one-quarter of Cambodia’s population, had died.

在红色高棉领导人和毛泽东崇拜者波尔布特的统治下，柬埔寨开始实施一项将自己重建为完美共产主 义国家的计划。红色高棉夺取私人财产并迫使城市居民搬迁到农村。人们被迫在工作营和集体农场劳 动，有些人因疾病和饥饿而死亡。那些无法工作的人被杀害。红色高棉还对专业人士、知识分子（可 能指任何戴眼镜的人）、基督徒、穆斯林、佛教僧侣以及中国人、泰国人和越南人进行了蓄意的灭绝 运动。 1978 年越南入侵柬埔寨，屠杀结束时，已有约 300 万人（约占柬埔寨人口的四分之一）死亡。

In the West there were new hopes for peace as the Cold War showed signs of thawing. At the 1972 Moscow Summit, the United States and the USSR signed the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty (SALT). A relaxation of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union that included trade agreements and additional arms-reduction talks. In 1975, the United States and the Soviet Union, along with Canada and all the countries of Europe, except for Albania, signed the Helsinki Accords. The United States and its allies pledged to respect the borders of Eastern Bloc countries and to refrain from intervening in their internal affairs. The Soviet Union promised to respect human rights.

随着冷战出现解冻迹象，西方出现了新的和平希望。在 1972 年莫斯 科峰会上，美国和苏联签署了《战略武器限制条约》(SALT). 美国和苏联之间的紧张局势有所缓和，其中包括贸易协定和额外的军备削减谈判。 1975年，美国、苏 联、加拿大以及除阿尔巴尼亚外的所有欧洲国家签署了《赫尔辛基协议》 。美国及其盟国承诺尊重东 欧集团国家的边界 ，不干涉其内政。苏联承诺尊重人权。

The peoples of Africa also wished to shake off Western control following World War II. The Atlantic Charter, a 1941 agreement by the United Kingdom and the United States regarding their shared goals for the postwar world, had promised self-determination for all, and African countries wanted to make this a reality.

非洲人民也希望在二战后摆脱西方的控制。 《大西洋宪章》是英国和美国于 1941 年 就战后世界共同目标达成的协议，承诺所有人享有自决权，非洲国家希望实现这一目标。

When the new leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power in 1985, discontent was simmering in the Soviet Union and in the countries of Eastern Europe. Shortages of food and other goods were making people angry. In Poland in 1980, shipyard workers under the leadership of labor activist Lech Wałęsa formed a trade union and went on strike to protest government policies. Within a year, one-third of Poland’s population had joined the Solidarity union. The Polish government tried to suppress the movement and banned the union, but its ten million members could not be silenced. Pope John Paul II, himself a Pole and an opponent of communism, called upon the Polish church to support the workers.

1985年苏联新领导人戈尔巴乔夫上台后，苏联和东欧国家的不满情绪不断发酵。食品和其他商品的短 缺让人们感到愤怒。 1980年，波兰造船厂工人在劳工活动家莱赫·瓦文萨的领导下成立了工会，并举行 罢工抗议政府政策。一年之内，三分之一的波兰人口加入了团结工会。波兰政府试图镇压该运动并取 缔该工会，但其一千万会员却无法被压制。教皇约翰·保罗二世本人是波兰人，也是共产主义的反对 者，他呼吁波兰教会支持工人。

Gorbachev realized the need for reform in the Soviet Union. He cut military spending and encouraged the beginnings of private enterprise. As part of his reform efforts, Gorbachev also encouraged glasnost or openness, allowing those who were angry to be critical of the government.

戈尔巴乔夫意识到苏联需要进行改革, 他削减军费开支并鼓励私营企业的兴起。作为改革努力的一部分，戈尔巴 乔夫还鼓励开放或开放，允许那些愤怒的人批评政府。

In 1988, protests broke out again in Poland, and strikes swept the country. The Polish government was forced to negotiate with Solidarity leaders and make concessions to them, including free elections for some government offices. In 1989, Hungary and East Germany opened their borders, allowing their citizens to come and go freely. Berliners climbed atop the wall that divided their city and began to tear it down. People in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia called for changes in their government as well. Gorbachev informed other members of the Soviet government that he did not intend to use military might to maintain control of Eastern Europe. In 1990, Germany was reunified.

1988年，波兰再次爆发抗议活动，罢工席卷全国。 波兰政府被迫与团结工会领导人谈判并向他们做出让步，包括一些政府职位的自由选举。 1989年，匈 牙利和东德开放边境，允许其公民自由出入。柏林人爬上分隔城市的城墙并开始将其拆除。保加利亚 和捷克斯洛伐克人民也呼吁改变政府。戈 尔巴乔夫告诉苏联政府其他成员，他不打算使用军事力量来维持对东欧的控制。 1990年，德国统一

But the reforms Gorbachev initiated to save the Soviet Union eventually tore it apart. The Soviet republics also wanted their independence.

In August 1991, conservative members of the Communist Party attempted to remove Gorbachev from power, only to be foiled by the actions of Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic. Acting together, Yeltsin and the presidents of the Soviet republics of Belarus and Ukraine voted in December 1991 to dissolve the Soviet Union. The Cold War was at an end.

但戈尔巴乔夫为拯救苏联而发起的改革最终导致了苏联的解体。苏维埃各加盟共和国也希望独立. 1991年8月，共产党保守派成员试图推翻戈尔巴乔夫，但被俄罗斯共和国总统鲍里斯·叶利钦的行动挫 败。 1991年12月，叶利钦与白俄罗斯和乌克兰苏维埃共和国总统共同投票决定解散苏联。冷战结束 了。

Ironically, the collapse of the Eastern Bloc also meant the demise of Yugoslavia, which had tried so hard to stand apart from it. In 1991 the states of Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina declared their independence from Yugoslavia.

具有讽刺意味的是，东欧集团的崩溃也意味着极力与之分离的南斯拉夫的灭亡。1991年，斯洛文尼亚、克罗 地亚和波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那宣布从南斯拉夫独立。

As Mao retreated into depression and ill health, his role was increasingly taken over by “The Gang of Four,” consisting of Mao’s wife Jiang Qing, his chosen successor Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan. However, they were primarily concerned with ensuring ideological purity and the continuation of “revolutionary” political thought. Crucial matters such as the economy were left in the hands of Premier Zhou Enlai.

。随着毛泽东陷入 抑郁和健康状况不佳，他的角色越来越多地被“四人帮”所取代，其中包括毛泽东的妻子江青、他选定的 继任者王洪文、张春桥和姚文元。然而，他们主要关心的是确保意识形态的纯洁性和“革命”政治思想的 延续。经济等重要事务都交给了周恩来总理。

Zhou, however, was dying of cancer and needed help. He returned Deng Xiaoping to power to assist him. Following Zhou’s death in January 1976, the Gang of Four managed to oust Deng Xiaoping from power once more, but this time he did not remain away for long.

然而，周恩来因癌症生命垂危，他让邓小平重新掌权以帮助他. 1976年1月周去世后，“四人帮”再次将邓小平赶下台，但这一次他并没有离开太久。

Following Mao’s death on September 9, 1976, his successor Hua Guofeng had the Gang of Four arrested and Deng returned to power. In 1978, he replaced Hua as leader of China and argued that the country needed to focus on modernizing and building its economy instead of continuing to pursue revolution by following the teachings of Mao. The Chinese system of higher education returned to normal as Deng reinstated entrance examinations, which had been suspended during the Cultural Revolution.

1976 年 9 月 9 日毛泽东去世后，他的继任者华国锋逮捕了“四人帮”，邓小平重新掌权。1978年，他取代华国锋成为中国领导 人，并认为国家需要专注于现代化和建设经济，而不是继续遵循毛泽东的教导进行革命。随着邓小平恢复文革 期间暂停的入学考试，中国的高等教育体系恢复正常.

Beginning in the late 1980s, relations with the Soviet Union also began to improve.

。从20世纪80年代末开始，与苏联的关系也开始改善
