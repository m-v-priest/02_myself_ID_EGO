At the Moscow Conference of 1944, which U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt did not attend, Prime
Minister Winston Churchill agreed to let Stalin install Soviet-allied communist parties to control the
governments of Romania and Bulgaria, which had been German allies during the war. In exchange,
Stalin promised to leave control of the Balkans to the British. By the time the victorious Allies met in
Potsdam in the summer of 1945 to finalize plans to partition Germany and its capital city of Berlin,
Churchill no longer wished Stalin to exercise so much power in Eastern Europe. He warned the new
U.S. president, Harry Truman, who was unaware of what had been agreed to at the Moscow
Conference, of the danger of allowing the Soviets to control the region. But Stalin then consolidated
his grip on Eastern Europe by placing a pro-Soviet government in power in Poland.

在美国总统富兰克林·罗斯福没有出席的1944 年莫斯科会议上，英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔同意让斯大林建
立与苏联结盟的共产党来控制罗马尼亚和保加利亚政府，这两个国家在战争期间曾是德国的盟友。作为
交换，斯大林承诺将巴尔干半岛的控制权交给英国。 1945 年夏天，获胜的同盟国在波茨坦会面，敲定
分割德国及其首都柏林的计划时，丘吉尔不再希望斯大林在东欧行使如此大的权力。他警告新任美国总
统哈里·杜鲁门(Harry Truman) ，让苏联控制该地区的危险，当时他并不知道莫斯科会议上达成的协议。
但斯大林随后通过在波兰建立亲苏联政府来巩固他对东欧的控制。

In March 1946, in a speech in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill warned his audience that “an iron curtain”
had cut Europe in two, trapping half the continent under Soviet domination. This division of the world
into United States–allied and Soviet-allied halves characterized the Cold War, a contest for
ideological, social, economic, technological, and military supremacy that lasted until the collapse of
the Soviet Union in 1991. The war was “cold” because it did not include actual fighting between U.S.
and Soviet forces. (A “hot” war is a conflict in which countries engage in armed conflict with one
another.)

1946 年 3 月，丘吉尔在密苏里州富尔顿发表演讲时警告观众，“铁幕”已将欧洲一分为二，将半个大陆
置于苏联的统治之下。冷战将世界划分为美国盟国和苏联盟国两半，这是一场意识形态、社会、经济、
技术和军事霸权的争夺，一直持续到 1991 年苏联解体。冷”，因为它不包括美国和苏联军队之间的实际
战斗。 （“热”战争是指国家之间发生武装冲突的冲突。）

The splintering of Europe that Churchill described deepened in 1948, when a government composed
of both communists and non-communists in Czechoslovakia was toppled and replaced by an allcommunist
government loyal to Moscow. In 1949, Hungary also came under the control of a
communist party closely allied with the Soviet Union.

丘吉尔所描述的欧洲分裂在 1948 年进一步加深，捷克斯洛伐克由共产党人和非共产党人组成的政府被
推翻，取而代之的是忠于莫斯科的全共产党政府。 1949年，匈牙利也受到与苏联密切结盟的共产党的
控制。

The chief strategy of the United States in the Cold War was containment—an effort to confine Soviet
influence to Eastern Europe.

美国在冷战时期的主要战略是遏制——努力将苏联的影响力限制在东欧。



The first test of U.S. resolve to counter the forces of communism came in 1947 in an unexpected
place—Greece. In 1946, following the triumph of monarchists in an election
the Greek communists boycotted, civil war broke out. Communist forces sought the overthrow of
King George II and his government.

1947 年，美国在一个意想不到的地方——希腊，第一次考验了美国对抗共产主义势力的决心。1946 年，君主主义者在希腊共产党抵制的选举中获胜，内战爆发。共产党军
队寻求推翻乔治二世国王及其政府.

The events in Greece worried the U.S. government. Neighboring Turkey was regarded as the gateway
to the Middle East and its crucial supplies of petroleum, upon which Western industry and
transportation depended. Truman feared that, should Greece become a communist country, a
communist uprising might occur in neighboring Turkey as well. This belief—that the neighbors of
communist countries would in turn become communist themselves—is known as the domino
theory.

希腊发生的事件令美国政府感到担忧。邻国土耳其被视为通往中东及其重要石油供应的门户，而西方工
业和运输业依赖于此。杜鲁门担心，如果希腊成为共产主义国家，邻国土耳其也可能发生共产主义起
义。这种信念——共产主义国家的邻国反过来也会成为共产主义国家——被称为多米诺骨牌理论。

The president’s pledge to help “free
peoples” resist communist expansion, a promise that became known as the Truman Doctrine,
formed the basis of U.S. foreign policy throughout the Cold War.

。总统承诺帮助“自由人民”抵制共产主义扩张，这一承诺被称为杜鲁门
主义，构成了整个冷战期间美国外交政策的基础。


The Marshall Plan

马歇尔计划

The U.S. effort to combat the expansion of communism also led to the creation of the European
Recovery Program, named the Marshall Plan for Secretary of State George C. Marshall. In 1947,
Marshall called for economic assistance to rebuild postwar Europe. Realizing the attractions of
communism to impoverished, war-ravaged Europeans, Congress approved the Economic
Cooperation Act in 1948 to pump an eventual total of $12 billion into Europe’s economy (about $147
billion today). The funds were vital in assisting Western Europe as a whole to rebuild their
infrastructure and restore their industrial capacity. Because necessary materials often needed to be
purchased from the United States, aid given through the Marshall Plan also helped ensure that the
U.S. economy did not slide into an economic depression now that the war had ended.

美国打击共产主义扩张的努力还导致了欧洲复苏计划的制定，国务卿乔治·C·马歇尔将其命名为“马歇尔
计划” 。 1947年，马歇尔呼吁提供经济援助以重建战后欧洲。意识到共产主义对贫困、饱受战争蹂躏的
欧洲人的吸引力，国会于 1948 年批准了《经济合作法案》，最终为欧洲经济注入了总计 120 亿美元的
资金（今天约为 1,470 亿美元）。这些资金对于协助整个西欧重建基础设施和恢复工业能力至关重要。
由于必需的物资往往需要从美国购买，通过马歇尔计划提供的援助也有助于确保美国经济不会在战争结
束后陷入经济萧条。


U.S. aid was offered to all European nations, including Germany and the Soviet Union. Stalin,
however, rejected it and forbade Eastern Europe’s communist-governed states within the Soviet
sphere of influence to accept it. Instead, the USSR proposed the Molotov Plan, which gave aid to and
established trade agreements with the communist nations of Eastern Europe: Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet zone in Germany that later became the
German Democratic Republic, commonly known as East Germany. Finally, in 1949, the United States
developed the Point Four Program to provide technical assistance to industrializing countries in Latin
America, Africa, and Asia for improving their standard of living.

美国向所有欧洲国家提供援助，包括德国和苏联。然而斯大林拒绝了它，并禁止苏联势力范围内的东欧
共产主义国家接受它。相反，苏联提出了莫洛托夫计划，该计划向东欧共产主义国家提供援助并与其建
立了贸易协定：保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚以及德国境内的苏联占领区（后来
成为德意志民主共和国）被称为东德。最后，1949年，美国制定了“第四点计划”，向拉丁美洲、非洲和
亚洲的工业化国家提供技术援助，以提高他们的生活水平。


The tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union that had built up slowly through the
later 1940s came to a head in 1948. Believing a strong Germany was vital to Europe’s economic
recovery and a necessary bulwark against the spread of communism, the United States, Britain, and
France planned to reunify the three zones of Germany they had occupied since the end of World War
II. United, these zones would dwarf the Soviet zone in size, population, and wealth and, by sharing a
single currency, play a major role in Europe’s postwar economy.

美国和苏联之间在 20 世纪 40 年代后期慢慢形成的紧张关系在 1948 年达到了顶峰。美国相信强大的德
国对于欧洲经济复苏至关重要，也是抵御共产主义蔓延的必要堡垒。英国和法国计划重新统一二战结束
后占领的德国三个地区。联合起来，这些地区在面积、人口和财富上将使苏联地区相形见绌，并且通过
共享单一货币，在欧洲战后经济中发挥重要作用。

The Soviet Union hoped to keep Germany disunited and weak and thus objected. In March 1948, it
withdrew from the Allied Control Council that coordinated Allied actions in Germany. In June, the
United Kingdom and the United States introduced a new currency, the Deutschemark, into their
zones as well as into the western portions of Berlin they controlled, in order to dispense Marshall
Plan funds. Infuriated, the Soviet Union cut off all ground routes into West Berlin. No food or fuel
could enter the city by road, railroad, or canal. The Soviets planned to starve the Western Allies out,
forcing them to abandon their sections of Berlin and thus their toehold within the Soviet zone.

苏联希望德国继续分裂、软弱，因此表示反对。 1948 年 3 月，它退出了协调盟军在德国行动的盟军控
制委员会。 6月，英国和美国在其管辖区以及其控制的柏林西部地区引入了一种新货币——德国马克，
以分配马歇尔计划资金。愤怒的苏联切断了通往西柏林的所有地面路线。任何食物或燃料都不能通过公
路、铁路或运河进入城市。苏联计划让西方盟军挨饿，迫使他们放弃柏林部分地区，从而放弃在苏联地
区的立足点。

The
Western Allies unified their occupation zones to form the new country of the Federal Republic of
Germany, usually referred to as West Germany, with the city of Bonn as its capital.

西方盟国统一了其占领区，成立了新国家德意志联邦共和国，通常称为西
德，以波恩市为首都。


The Western Allies then took another step to guard against potential Soviet aggression. In 1948,
Belgium, France, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom had signed the Treaty of
Brussels, forming a military alliance for purposes of protection against the Soviet Union. In 1949,
shortly before the Berlin blockade ended, the United States joined those nations as well as Canada,
Portugal, Italy, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), an alliance for military assistance and mutual defense. Should one of the member nations
be attacked, the others agreed to come to its aid.


随后西方盟国又采取了另一步骤来防范苏联潜在的侵略。 1948年，比利时、法国、卢森堡、荷兰和英
国签署了《布鲁塞尔条约》 ，结成军事联盟，以抵御苏联。 1949 年，柏林封锁结束前不久，美国与这
些国家以及加拿大、葡萄牙、意大利、丹麦、挪威和冰岛一起成立了北大西洋公约组织 (NATO) ，这是
一个军事援助和共同防御的联盟。如果其中一个成员国受到攻击，其他国家同意提供援助。


In 1955, when West Germany also joined NATO, the Soviet Union formed a military and political
alliance of its own, the Warsaw Treaty Organization or the Warsaw Pact. Its other members were the
communist nations of Eastern Europe: Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), formerly the Soviet occupation
zone.

1955年，当西德也加入北约时，苏联也成立了自己的军事和政治联盟，即华沙条约组织或华沙条约组
织。它的其他成员是东欧共产主义国家：阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马
尼亚和德意志民主共和国（东德）（前苏联占领区）。

The Cold War in Europe. After West Germany joined NATO in 1955, the Soviet Union and other nations formed their own
alliance, resulting in the creation of the Eastern Bloc. Yugoslavia, although a communist nation and considered part of this bloc, had
officially divorced itself from Soviet control prior to the Warsaw Pact.

欧洲冷战。 1955年西德加入北约后，苏联和其他国家组成了自己的联盟 ，最终形成了东欧集团。南斯拉夫虽然是一个共产主义国
家并被视为该集团的一部分，但在华沙条约之前已正式脱离苏联的控制。

The Cold War between West and East was fought on many fronts with many strategies. Both sides
provided aid and technical assistance to countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, many of which
had been European colonies until the end of World War II. Through such aid, the United States hoped
to contain the spread of communism by depriving countries of an economic reason for aligning
themselves with the Soviet Union. Communism was attractive to many poor people.

东西方之间的冷战是在多条战线上进行的，采取了多种策略。双方向拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲国家提供援
助和技术援助，其中许多国家在二战结束前一直是欧洲殖民地。美国希望通过此类援助，剥夺各国与苏
联结盟的经济理由，从而遏制共产主义的蔓延。共产主义对许多穷人有吸引力


In 1949, the
Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb, ending the U.S. monopoly on nuclear weapons. In 1952 the
United States took the next step, one opposed by some of the same atomic scientists who had
worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II, and developed the hydrogen bomb, testing it
on the Pacific atoll of Eniwetok in 1952.

1949年，苏联
引爆了原子弹，结束了美国对核武器的垄断。 1952 年，美国采取了下一步行动，开发了氢弹，并于
1952 年在太平洋埃尼威托克环礁上进行了测试，但遭到了二战期间参与曼哈顿计划的一些原子科学家
的反对。

In the 1950s, both the United States and the USSR developed intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs) as well.

Both
the United States and the USSR quickly came to believe that the key to survival lay in building an
immense retaliatory capacity, the ability to unleash devastation so great that the other side would
never detonate the first bomb for fear of its own annihilation. In the United States, this defense policy
came to be referred to as “mutually assured destruction” (MAD).


20世纪50年代，美国和苏联也开发了洲际弹道导弹（ICBM） 。美国和苏联很快就相信，生存的关键在于建立强大的报复能力，这种能力能够造成
巨大的破坏，以至于对方因为担心自己的毁灭而永远不会引爆第一颗炸弹。在美国，这种国防政策被称
为“相互确保毁灭”（MAD）。


In the immediate postwar period, Europe was the focus of U.S. anti-communist anxiety. The United
States expended billions of dollars in Marshall Plan aid to stave off the expansion of communism
there. It was in Asia, however, that the policy of containment was most strongly challenged.

战后初期，欧洲是美国反共焦虑的焦点。美国在马歇尔计划中花费了数十亿美元的援助来阻止那里共
产主义的扩张。然而，遏制政策在亚洲受到最强烈的挑战。
