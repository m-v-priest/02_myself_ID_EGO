== 6-11世纪 → 日耳曼人国家的建立

Western Afro-Eurasia faced a number of challenges in the early Middle Ages, the period from about 500 to 1000 CE. With the collapse of Roman authority came a time of political instability and insecurity. Cities declined, and institutions of learning weakened. Western Europe became increasingly rural. Because there was no longer a strong centralized state to develop and police the roads, travel became more difficult and more dangerous, harming commerce.

西非-欧亚大陆在中世纪早期（大约公元 500 年至 1000 年）面临着许多挑战。随着罗马权威的崩溃，政治不稳定和不安全的时期到来了。城市衰落，学习机构衰弱。西欧变得越来越乡村化。由于不再有一个强大的中央集权国家来开发和监管道路，旅行变得更加困难和危险，损害了商业。

===  German 日耳曼人

.所指民族 : 其实是个泛称, 包含很多不同民族

“German” was the term Romans used for all the peoples beyond their northern borders.

“日耳曼人”是罗马人用来称呼”北方边界以外的所有民族”的术语.

The relationship between the term “German” and the peoples to whom it has been applied is complex. Some of those who invaded the Roman Empire did not speak a Germanic language at all, such as the Huns and Avars. There were few rigid ethnic boundaries between the groups, and the armies of any leader often included warriors from other tribes.

“日耳曼人”一词与其所应用指代的民族之间, 关系很复杂。有些入侵罗马帝国的人根本不会说日耳曼语言，例如匈奴人和阿瓦尔人。这些群体之间几乎没有严格的种族界限，任何领导者的军队通常都包括来自其他部落的战士。

.宗教:

日耳曼人是多神论者，崇拜各种神祇.

.文化:

The Germanic peoples generally did not read or write and instead transmitted information and traditions orally. Famous tales that eventually found their way into written form, such as the Song of Hildebrand and the Song of the Nibelungs, had their beginnings as spoken epics.

日耳曼民族一般不读书或写字，而是口头来传播信息和继承传统。最终以书面形式出现的著名故事，例如 《希尔德布兰德之歌》和《尼伯龙根之歌》 ，最初都是口头史诗。


'''

===  the Franks 法兰克王国 (481-843年)

==== 墨洛温王朝 (481-751年)

The most successful Germanic kingdom was that of the Franks. Clovis I, a member of the Merovingian dynasty, founded the kingdom in the early sixth century.

最成功的日耳曼王国是法兰克王国。墨洛温王朝成员克洛维一世(法兰克王国奠基人), 于六世纪初建立了该王国.

A chief source of conflict was the practice of partible inheritance, whereby each son received an equal share of his father’s estate. Estates thus became smaller with each successive generation unless new lands were conquered, often by being taken from siblings, in-laws, or cousins. Kings without land and resources to offer as reward lost the ability to attract fighters.

随着时间的推移，墨洛温王朝的统治者陷入了暴力的内讧. 冲突的一个主要根源是分割继承的做法，即每个儿子均分其父亲的遗产。因此，每一代人的分封领土都会变得越来越小 (众建诸侯少其力)，除非征服了新的土地，通常是从兄弟姐妹、姻亲或表兄弟那里夺取的。国王没有了土地和资源来作为奖励, 就失去了吸引战士的能力。

Real power lay with the aristocrats, and eventually a new dynasty called the Carolingians took control of the Frankish kingdom.

真正的权力掌握在贵族手中，最终一个名为"加洛林王朝"的新王朝, 控制了法兰克王国。

'''

====  加洛林王朝 (751-843年) (佩平捐赠)

With the support of the pope, Pépin le Bref (Pippin the Short) became the first Carolingian king of the Franks, deposing his Merovingian rival. In return, he confirmed a grant of lands in Italy to the pope.

This grant, known as the Donation of Pepin, provided the legal basis for the establishment of the Papal States and helped ensure that the papacy, the set of administrative structures associated with the government of the Catholic Church, was not just a religious institution but also a territorial power.

在教皇的支持下，皮平(矮子"丕平")成为第一位"加洛林王朝"的法兰克国王，废黜了他的"墨洛温王朝"对手。作为回报，他确认将意大利的土地, 授予教皇。

这项被称为"佩平捐赠"的拨款，为"教皇国"的建立提供了法律基础，有助于确保教皇这一与"天主教会"政府相关的行政机构，不仅是一个宗教机构，而且还拥有领土权力。

Their alliance with the popes allowed the Carolingian rulers to work independently of the Byzantine Empire.

他们(丕平)与教皇的联盟, 使得"加洛林王朝"的统治者, 能够独立于"拜占庭帝国"而运作。

'''

====  查理曼大帝 (首次统一了西欧)

Pépin’s son Charles, known as Charlemagne (“Charles the Great”), was the most influential ruler in the early European Middle Ages. He campaigned nearly every year of his reign, uniting western Europe for the first time since the collapse of Roman authority.

On Christmas Day in the year 800, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III. This coronation angered Byzantine rulers and set the stage for conflict between east and west in their quest for prestige and territory.

丕平的儿子查理，被称为查理曼大帝（“查理大帝”），是欧洲中世纪早期最有影响力的统治者. 他在位期间, 几乎每年都征战，自罗马权威崩溃以来, 首次统一了西欧。

800年圣诞节，查理曼大帝被教皇利奥三世, 加冕为罗马皇帝。这次加冕礼激怒了东罗马"拜占庭"统治者，并为东西方之间争夺威望和领土的冲突, 埋下了伏笔。

Charlemagne’s empire did not last.  From the east came nomadic raiders, the Magyars, a non- Germanic people who migrated from the steppes of central Asia. At the end of the ninth century, they settled in what is today Hungary, and from there they launched devastating raids for plunder into Germany.

查理曼的帝国并没有持续多久。来自东方的游牧掠夺者马扎尔人, 是从中亚草原迁徙而来的非日耳曼民族。九世纪末，他们定居在今天的匈牙利，并从那里对日耳曼发起毁灭性的掠夺。


'''

===  the Vikings 维京人

Perhaps more famous today than the Magyars and Islamic raiders were the Norse who raided northern Europe from Scandinavia, called the Vikings. The peoples of Scandinavia, who spoke Germanic languages, had a culture similar to that of the Germanic peoples who settled in the Roman Empire.

今天，也许比"马扎尔人"和"伊斯兰袭击者"更出名的, 是从"斯堪的纳维亚半岛"袭击北欧的挪威人，即"维京人"。斯堪的纳维亚半岛的人民, 讲日耳曼语言，其文化与定居在罗马帝国的日耳曼人民相似。

The growth of the population in the eighth century and the relative lack of arable land in Scandinavia compelled groups of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes to travel in search of plunder.

In the west, the arrival of the Norse raiders was less benign. The sudden nature of the violent raids, and the inability of Frankish or Anglo-Saxon armies to defeat them, instilled fear in the population of western Europe.

八世纪人口的增长, 和"斯堪的纳维亚半岛"耕地的相对缺乏, 迫使丹麦人、挪威人和瑞典人, 向外部世界寻找掠夺品。

在西边，挪威入侵者的到来就不那么友好了。他们暴力袭击的突然性，以及法兰克或盎格鲁撒克逊军队无力击败他们，给西欧人民带来了恐惧。

Eventually, the Norse raiders began to settle in regions rather than just raid them.

- In 865, a substantial army of Vikings invaded Britain and destroyed most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except for Wessex.
- In 911, they settled in northern France, establishing the duchy of Normandy.

最终，挪威掠夺者开始在一些地区定居，而不仅仅是袭击它们。 865年，维京人大军入侵不列颠，摧毁了除威塞克斯以外的大部分盎格鲁撒克逊王国。 911年，他们在法国北部定居，建立诺曼底公国。

Like the earlier Germanic peoples, they eventually converted to Roman Christianity, and their kings began to build more centralized kingdoms that enabled them to curb the violence of the raiders.

像早期的日耳曼民族一样，他们最终皈依了罗马基督教，他们的国王开始建立更加中央集权的王国，使他们能够遏制其他入侵者的暴力。

==  11-13世纪 → 建立十字军国家 (教皇的国度, 有点像后世清教徒的”山巅之城”理想)

=== Jerusalem 耶路撒冷

Jerusalem drew pilgrims from the three monotheistic religions.

"耶路撒冷"吸引了来自三种"一神教"的朝圣者。

'''


.对"犹太教"来说:

- Jerusalem was the site of the holiest of holies of Judaism, the most sacred of spaces where the Temple of Solomon had stood until its destruction by the Romans.
- Pilgrimage had been obligatory for Jewish people until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, but even after that time, the city continued to play a special role in Jewish life.

1.那里有所罗门圣殿遗址, 2.朝圣一直是犹太人的义务

.对"基督教"来说:
- In the earliest decades of the first century, it had also become the location for some of the most dramatic and important scenes in the life of Jesus and the early Christian community.
- In the time of Constantine, a church had been built over the site of what was believed to be Jesus’s tomb, called the Holy Sepulchre. As the place where it is believed Jesus was crucified and resurrected, Jerusalem was bound up with the most essential Christian beliefs.

1.它是耶稣和早期基督教社区生活中一些最戏剧性和最重要的场景的发生地。2.在被认为是耶稣坟墓和复活的地方, 建造了一座教堂，称为圣墓。

.对"伊斯兰教"来说:
- Muhammad is said to have made a special journey to be able to pray in Jerusalem and to be allowed to glimpse God before he continued his mission to convert others to Islam.
- The Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on the old Temple Mount in Jerusalem, is the third holiest site in the faith, and it is believed to be mentioned several times in the Quran as “the furthest shrine.”
- Another shrine, called the Dome of the Rock, was also built near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is associated with Muhammad’s journey and with the biblical Abraham, an important figure to Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike.

1.穆罕默德曾去过耶路撒冷祈祷. 2.那有阿克萨清真寺, 3.那有圆顶清真寺 (该清真寺与穆罕默德的旅程, 和圣经中的亚伯拉罕有关).

'''

===  参加十字军的人的目的

Some may have hoped to gain land if they remained in the Holy Land, and others were motivated simply to see the earthly Jerusalem as a way of experiencing the heavenly Jerusalem that awaited them when they died, and then returned home.

1.获得圣地的土地 (为了定居). 2.将地上的耶路撒冷, 视为一种体验天上耶路撒冷的方式. 然后就返回家园 (不定居在圣地).

'''

===  十字军的讨伐敌人 : 教皇的所有敌人

The crusading ideal was also transformed by practice and experience. The popes now called holy wars not just to liberate Jerusalem but to fight against the enemies of the church. Crusades were called against non-Christians in the Baltic regions, against heretics in France, and even against the pope’s personal enemies in Italy.

(在所有n次十字军行动失败后,) 十字军理想也因实践和经验而改变。教皇现在称圣战不仅是为了解放耶路撒冷，也是为了对抗教会的敌人。十字军东征的目标是波罗的海地区的非基督徒，法国的异端，甚至意大利的教皇的私人敌人 。

'''

===  十字军理想的消失

Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the crusading ideal declined in popularity. This was due in part to the decline of the power of the papacy and in part to the revival of royal power in the fourteenth century. The Crusades had been launched by popular popes. Over time, they came to seem more concerned about their own power and prestige and less like the hard-working clerics who had battled kings for the freedom of the church.

中世纪末期，十字军理想不再受欢迎。这部分是由于教皇权力的衰落，部分是由于十四世纪王权的复兴。十字军东征是由教皇发动的。但随着时间的推移，他们似乎越来越只关心自己的权力和威望，不再像那些"为教会自由而与国王作战"的努力的神职人员。

'''

===  十字军东征的简要介绍

==== 第1次东征

While the Byzantine emperor wanted aid for his realm, Urban instead sent the crusaders to Jerusalem.

当拜占庭皇帝希望为他的王国提供援助时，乌尔班却将十字军派往耶路撒冷。(罗马教皇的目的不是为了帮助君士坦丁堡对抗外敌, 而是为了自己夺回圣地)

The bulk of the First Crusade was directed by powerful aristocrats whose armies were better organized than Peter’s, even if most of its participants were not the most senior nobles of Western society. Alexios promised them aid in exchange for the return of Byzantine territory held by Muslims, which most initially agreed to.  ... straining the relationships between the crusaders and the Byzantine Empire.

第一次十字军东征的大部分由强大的贵族指挥，他们的军队比"隐士彼得"的军队组织得更好，尽管大多数参与者并不是西方社会最高级的贵族。阿莱克修斯(拜占庭第二任皇帝)向他们承诺提供援助，条件是换取他们归还被穆斯林占领的拜占庭领土，大多数人最初都同意了。(但他们事后又没兑现承诺,) 这使得十字军与拜占庭帝国之间的关系变得紧张。

The crusading armies then took other important cities in the area, and to secure their control they established the four Crusader States: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. These Crusader States were also called Outremer (literally “overseas”) by the French.

(1099年占领耶路撒冷后,) 随后十字军占领了该地区的其他重要城市，为了确保控制权，他们建立了四个十字军国家：埃德萨郡、安条克公国、的黎波里郡和耶路撒冷王国。这些十字军国家也被法国人称为Outremer （字面意思是“海外”）.

image:/img/0023.jpg[,80%]

The crusaders organized their government in feudal terms, but the native populations never became serfs owing service to their lords. Instead, they paid their taxes in cash or in goods.

十字军以"封建"形式组织了政府，但当地居民从未因为领主服务而成为农奴。相反，他们以现金或货物缴纳税款。

The lack of settlers from Europe ensured that the number of soldiers in Outremer was small. This was why the crusaders built imposing fortresses and castles, like the famous Krak des Chevaliers in Syria.

由于缺乏来自欧洲的定居者，海外地区的士兵数量很少。这就是为什么十字军建造了气势磅礴的堡垒和城堡，比如叙利亚著名的骑士堡.

The Muslims adapted quickly, however. A Turkic aristocrat named Imad al-Din Zengi managed to take the city of Edessa, in the northernmost of the Crusader States. The loss of Edessa posed a serious threat to the remaining Crusader States, however, and prompted the pope to call the Second Crusade.

然而，穆斯林很快就适应了，一位名叫伊马德丁·赞吉（Imad al-Din Zengi）的突厥贵族成功占领了位于十字军国家最北端的埃德萨。埃德萨的丧失对剩余的十字军国家构成了严重威胁，并促使教皇召开了第二次十字军东征。

'''

====  第2次东征

This crusade was led by powerful rulers, including King Louis VII of France and King Conrad III of Germany. The armies of the Second Crusade were defeated in Anatolia in separate battles, and few soldiers reached the Holy Land. The kings accomplished very little, and many blamed the Byzantine emperor, who had learned to be distrustful of European armies.

这次十字军东征是由强大的统治者领导的，其中包括法国国王路易七世和德国国王康拉德三世。第二次十字军东征的军队在安纳托利亚的多次战斗中被击败，很少有士兵到达圣地。国王们几乎没有取得什么成就，许多人指责拜占庭皇帝，因为他已经学会了对欧洲军队的不信任。

After this loss, the situation for Outremer only became more dire. Imad al-Din Zengi’s successors were well liked, even by crusaders, and they strove to unite the Muslim princes in jihad. The most famous of these successors was Salah al-Din, or Saladin in the Christian world. He was known for being humane, fair-minded, and, in Christians terms, chivalrous. In 1187, after years of gathering allies and eroding the military power of Outremer, he destroyed the crusaders at the Battle of the Horns of Hattin (in today’s Israel). Within months, Jerusalem fell to Saladin.

这次失利之后，Outremer的处境变得更加严峻。(伊斯兰的)伊马德·丁·赞吉的继任者很受欢迎，甚至受到十字军的喜爱，他们努力团结穆斯林王子进行圣战。这些继任者中最著名的是萨拉丁（Salah al-Din），即基督教世界的萨拉丁。他以仁慈、公正、用基督徒的话来说，具有侠义精神而闻名. 1187 年，经过多年聚集盟友并削弱 Outremer 的军事力量，他在哈丁角战役（位于今天的以色列）消灭了十字军。几个月之内，耶路撒冷落入萨拉丁之手。

The Christians’ response was the Third Crusade (1189–1192).

基督徒的回应是第三次十字军东征（1189-1192）。

'''

====  第3次东征

This crusade was prompted both by the fear that Outremer was about to be wiped off the map and by the desire to retake Jerusalem. Kings from England, the Holy Roman Empire, and France as well as other powerful princes answered the call. When they arrived in the last remaining Christian outposts in the Middle East, they quickly fell to squabbling with each other and the aristocracy of Outremer. As a result, the Christians were able to conquer the island of Cyprus and the coastline of the Holy Land but were unable to move farther inland.

这次十字军东征的动机, 既有对海外领土即将从地图上消失的恐惧，也有夺回耶路撒冷的愿望。来自英格兰、神圣罗马帝国, 和法国的国王, 以及其他强大的王子响应了这一号召。当他们到达中东仅存的基督教前哨基地时，他们很快就陷入了彼此之间, 以及与 Outremer贵族的争吵中。结果，基督徒能够征服塞浦路斯岛和圣地的海岸线，但无法进一步再向内陆前进。

Eventually, Richard I of England, known in popular stories as Richard the Lionhearted, negotiated a treaty with Saladin that left Jerusalem under Muslim control but allowed Christian pilgrims to freely visit the city.

最终，英国的理查一世（在流行故事中被称为"狮心王理查"）与萨拉丁谈判达成一项条约，将耶路撒冷置于穆斯林控制之下，但允许基督教朝圣者自由访问这座城市。

'''

====  十字军国家的全部陷落

Later calls for crusades were met with some enthusiasm, but the object of the fight became Egypt, recognized as an important base for controlling the Holy Land.

Nevertheless, later crusades became increasingly French and less successful at accomplishing their goals. The French crusader-king Louis IX led the Seventh and Eighth Crusades against Muslim rulers in North Africa and died of illness there. (He was later canonized as St. Louis.)

后来十字军东征的呼声得到了一些热情，但战斗的对象却变成了埃及，被认为是控制圣地的重要基地。
然而，后来的十字军东征越来越法国化，并且在实现其目标方面不太成功。法国十字军国王路易九世领导了第七次和第八次十字军东征，对抗北非的穆斯林统治者，并在那里病逝。 （他后来被封为圣路易斯。）

When the port city of Acre in present-day Israel fell in 1291, the last of the Crusader States fell with it.

1291 年，当今天以色列的港口城市"阿卡"陷落时，最后一个十字军国家也随之陷落。

== 动荡的14世纪 → 小冰期, 黑死病, 城市经济的发展

The Fourteenth Century Begins. This map depicts the patchwork of kingdoms and political entities in Europe and beyond at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The many divisions ensured that political fragmentation rather than centralization defined the region throughout the medieval period, and many states depicted here still lacked a strong, centralized rule entirely.

The fourteenth century was generally an era of chronic conflict and instability for most of the continent.

十四世纪开始。这张地图描绘了十四世纪初, 欧洲及其他地区的王国和政治实体。在整个中世纪时期，小国众多的分裂局面, 确保了该地区在政治上是分裂的, 而不是集权的，并且这里描绘的许多国家仍然尚不存在强大的集权统治能力。 +
对于欧洲大陆的大部分地区来说，14世纪总体上是一个长期冲突和不稳定的时代

'''

===  小冰期

Because trees can live for hundreds or even thousands of years, during which they experience a variety of environmental fluctuations, clues about these changing conditions are often hidden within the rings in their stumps. The color and width of tree rings can provide snapshots of past climate conditions.

由于树木可以存活数百年甚至数千年，在此期间它们会经历各种环境波动，因此有关这些变化条件的线索, 通常隐藏在树桩的年轮中. 树木年轮的颜色和宽度, 可以提供过去气候条件的快照.

This chart depicts the shift in the Northern Hemisphere’s temperature over the last millennium, including the Medieval Warm Period that began in the tenth century and the Little Ice Age that ran from the fourteenth century to approximately 1850.

这张图表描绘了北半球近千年来的气温变化，包括从10世纪开始的中世纪"温暖期", 和从14世纪到1850年左右的"小冰期"。

image:/img/0029.jpg[,100%]

There had been a global temperature decrease of 0.6°C, with some areas experiencing as much as a two-degree drop in annual temperature. Despite their global impact, the effects of the Little Ice Age were not the same everywhere.

全球平均气温总体下降 0.6°C（某些地区年气温下降多达两度）。尽管影响全球，但小冰河时代的影响在各地并不相同。

- In the Mediterranean and West Africa, irregular rainfall and periods of drought dramatically reduced crop yields,
- whereas in China and northern Europe, cold weather and the freezing of lakes and rivers were especially pronounced.
- 在地中海和西非，不规则的降雨和干旱, 使农作物产量大幅下降，
- 而在中国和北欧，寒冷的天气, 以及湖泊和河流的结冰尤为明显。

'''

===  小冰期带来的影响

==== 粮食歉收, 饥荒蔓延

In an era during which many people survived on subsistence agriculture, even the slightest change in seasonal weather patterns could devastate crops and result in widespread malnourishment and starvation.

在一个许多人靠自给农业生存的时代，即使季节性天气模式发生最轻微的变化, 也可能毁坏农作物, 并导致广泛的营养不良和饥饿。

This led to catastrophic crop failures and widespread famine in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere within the first few decades of the fourteenth century.

在十四世纪的最初几十年内，它(小冰期)导致了北半球许多地区灾难性的农作物歉收和大范围的饥荒。

.案例
====
这句话中使用 “as” 或 “because” 都可以，但它们有细微的差别，主要体现在句子的语气和重点上：

- “as”：强调两个动作或现象同时发生，或是说明现象随时间的推移逐渐发生变化。它更侧重于过程的自然关联，不一定非常强调因果关系。

例句：“As more water turned to ice, less was available to evaporate and turn into rain.” +
这里的“as”表达的是随着冰的增加，水的蒸发减少，两者几乎是并行的现象。这种表达更侧重于描绘过程中的变化，语气较轻。

- “because”：更直接地强调因果关系，即某个现象明确导致了另一个现象发生。它更明确地回答“为什么”某件事情发生。

例句：“Because more water turned to ice, less was available to evaporate and turn into rain.” +
使用“because”时，重点在于冰的增加是导致水蒸发减少的原因，更加明确地说明了因果关系。它回答了“为什么会有更少的水蒸发”。

总结： +
如果你想轻描淡写地描述两者之间的关联，或将注意力集中在两件事情同时发生的过程中，用 “as” 更为自然。
如果你想更加强调冰的增加直接导致了水的减少，选择 “because” 会更明确。 +
这取决于你想如何引导读者理解两者的关系：是一个自然变化的现象，还是一个因果关系。

==== 政府无法解决灾害问题, 在民众中的公信力下降

Ultimately, the Great Famine led many to question the ability of church officials and monarchs to respond effectively to crises and catastrophes, which had long-term effects on public trust in these institutions.

长期的粮食短缺, 还导致了广泛的政治和经济不稳定。最终，大饥荒导致许多人质疑教会官员和君主有效应对危机和灾难的能力， 这对"公众对这些机构的信任"产生了长期影响。

===  瘟疫 (鼠疫, 黑死病)

==== 患者的症状

The bubonic plague, the most common variant of the disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, raises egg-shaped swellings known as buboes near an afflicted person’s lymph nodes in the groin, underarm, and upper neck areas. For the vast majority in the Middle Ages, death generally occurred within three days.

The disease has a mortality rate ranging from 30 to 80 percent, which is significantly higher than that of the deadliest smallpox, influenza, and polio pandemics of the modern era.

黑死病是由"鼠疫耶尔森氏菌"引起的最常见的疾病变种，它会在患者腹股沟、腋下, 和上颈部区域的淋巴 结附近, 产生蛋形肿胀，称为"腹股沟淋巴结炎"。 +
对于中世纪的绝大多数人来说，死亡通常发生在三天内。这种死亡率为 30% 至 80% 的疾病, (其致死率)明显高于现代最致命的天花、流感, 和脊髓灰质炎大流行。

Two even deadlier variants of the disease eventually emerged during the fourteenth century: pneumonic and septicemic.

在十四世纪，这种疾病最终出现了两种更致命的变种： "肺鼠疫"和"败血性鼠疫"。

|pneumonic :
|The pneumonic form directly infected the lungs and was spread from person to person by coughing, with a mortality rate of 95 to 100 percent.
肺鼠疫直接感染肺部，并通过咳嗽在人与人之间传播，死亡率为 95% 至 100%。
|septicemic :
|The septicemic variant, which resulted from plague bacteria circulating directly into the bloodstream, was invariably fatal and, according to contemporary observers, seemed to kill within hours of the first onset of symptoms.
这种败血症变异, 是由鼠疫细菌直接循环到血液中引起的，它总是致命的，根据当代观察家的说法，似乎在首次出现症状后, 数小时内就会死亡。

'''

==== 鼠疫杆菌的传播媒介 → 鼠蚤

Although in its bubonic form the plague could not be spread from human to human, the rat flea became a major plague vector. The black rat was one of the most capable animal hosts for the plague-carrying fleas. It was highly susceptible to the disease itself.

Plague-bearing fleas generally preferred to feed on small rodents such as rats and marmots, but when their rodent hosts succumbed to the plague, they secured their next meal from the nearest human.

鼠疫无法仅靠人与人传播, 它必须借助传播媒介—鼠蚤.

鼠蚤常常存在在黑鼠 (及老鼠, 土拨鼠)身上. 因此黑鼠本身就容易感染鼠疫这种瘟疫.

'''

====  传播过程

The plague spread into the European interior, leaving perhaps as many as twenty-four million dead, roughly 30 percent of the continent’s population at the time.

After the plague had run its course by the 1350s, it recurred in cyclical fashion several times during the second half of the fourteenth century. It was never fully eradicated.

瘟疫传播到欧洲内陆，导致大约 2400 万人死亡，约占当时欧洲大陆人口的 30%。 +
瘟疫在 1350 年代结束后，在 14 世纪下半叶又周期性地复发了几次。它从未被完全根除.

'''

===  鼠疫对人们思想造成的变化 : 从挣扎到躺平

Social responses to the plague in medieval Europe ranged from increased piety to hedonism to resigned acceptance of inevitable death.

中世纪欧洲对瘟疫的社会反应, 从日益虔诚(期待上帝的拯救), 到享乐主义(过把瘾就死)，再到放弃并接受不可避免的死亡(躺平)。

'''

===  鼠疫对社会变化的影响

==== 宗教解决不了实际问题, 因此对教会的信仰下降

Old systems of belief came into question.

旧的信仰体系受到质疑.

Failing to fully grasp how and why the disease was spreading, however, many of the devout turned to the clergy, who were also dying in record numbers, mostly because of their efforts to care for the sick.

由于无法完全掌握这种疾病传播的方式和原因，许多虔诚的信徒转向神职人员，而神职人员的死亡人数也创历史新高，主要是因为他们努力照顾病人。

The disadvantaged began to question whether social elites really did enjoy God’s privilege, as the social hierarchy generally preached, since they too succumbed to the plague and failed to care for those to whom they bore responsibility.

弱势群体开始质疑, 社会精英是否真的像社会等级制度普遍宣扬的那样, 享有上帝的特权，因为他们也死于瘟疫，并且没有照顾他们应该照顾的人。

'''

====  人口下降, 劳动力市场供小于求,  使底层人民更有能力, 来和上层谈条件, 争取更多权力.

Given massive depopulation, peasants left the feudal estates on which their families had lived for generations, as landlords elsewhere offered more generous terms of labor to attract workers who could replace the dead. Because the demand for labor was so high, peasants who remained in the countryside, especially males, were now able to press their employers for more money and rights.

鉴于人口大量减少, 农民们离开了他们的家人世代居住的封建庄园，因为其他地方的地主提供了更慷慨的劳动条件, 来吸引可以替代”死去者”的人。由于对劳动力的需求如此之高，留在农村的农民，尤其是男性，现在能够向雇主施压，要求更多的金钱和权利。

'''

====  ①农奴人口下降, 导致封建贵族的权力下降, 君主权力上升. ②农民进入城市找工作, 促进城市经济兴起, 进而带来商人阶层出现.

Many peasants also left the countryside to seek wage labor and employment in cities, which began experiencing significant labor shortages as a result of the plague’s staggering death toll.

许多农民也离开农村, 到城市寻找工资劳动和就业机会. 因为那里由于之前瘟疫造成的惊人死亡人数，导致城市出现严重的劳动力短缺 (所以农民能够在城市找到工作)。

With fewer people to work their land and generate income for them, their collective wealth contracted significantly. The power of local nobles and landowners was also being eclipsed by more powerful monarchs and emerging urban economies that bolstered the growth of towns and cities.

===  神圣罗马帝国

Another center of political instability during this period was the Holy Roman Empire.

这一时期另一个政治不稳定的中心, 是神圣罗马帝国。

In the fourteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire, which had been founded by Charlemagne in 800, comprised four main entities—the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Germany (including lands that now are part of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), the Kingdom of Burgundy (a region in southeastern France), and the Kingdom of Bohemia (what is now the Czech Republic and part of Poland) under the nominal control of an elected emperor. Each of these kingdoms, in turn, was composed of a loose coalition of independent territories with different hereditary rulers.

Rather than adopting a common currency, legal system, or representative assembly, the Holy Roman Empire remained a patchwork of semiautonomous principalities. Although each of these became relatively stable, the empire itself was a weak and decentralized political entity.

By the end of the fourteenth century, it included more than one hundred principalities, each with varying degrees of power and autonomy.

神圣罗马帝国, 由查理曼大帝在公元800年建立.

14世纪时, 它由四个主要实体组成: 1.意大利王国、2.德意志王国(包括现在属于比利时、荷兰、德国、奥地利和瑞士的土地)、3.勃艮第王国(法国东南部的一个地区), 和4.波希米亚王国(现在的捷克共和国和波兰的一部分)

到14世纪末时，它包括一百多个半自治的公国，每个公国都拥有不同程度的权力和自治权。因此帝国本身是一个软弱且分散的政治实体.

神圣罗马帝国没有统一的货币、法律体系, 或代表大会.

名义上由一位选出的皇帝控制.
