== 6-11世纪 → 日耳曼人国家的建立

Western Afro-Eurasia faced a number of challenges in the early Middle Ages, the period from about 500 to 1000 CE. With the collapse of Roman authority came a time of political instability and insecurity. Cities declined, and institutions of learning weakened. Western Europe became increasingly rural. Because there was no longer a strong centralized state to develop and police the roads, travel became more difficult and more dangerous, harming commerce.


Post-Roman Western Eurasia. This map shows the Eastern Roman Empire as dominant in the eastern Mediterranean around 500 CE, and the division of western Europe among various successor kingdoms at this time.



'''

===  German 日耳曼人

.所指民族 : 其实是个泛称, 包含很多不同民族

“German” was the term Romans used for all the peoples beyond their northern borders.


The relationship between the term “German” and the peoples to whom it has been applied is complex. Some of those who invaded the Roman Empire did not speak a Germanic language at all, such as the Huns and Avars. There were few rigid ethnic boundaries between the groups, and the armies of any leader often included warriors from other tribes.


.宗教:


.文化:

The Germanic peoples generally did not read or write and instead transmitted information and traditions orally. Famous tales that eventually found their way into written form, such as the Song of Hildebrand and the Song of the Nibelungs, had their beginnings as spoken epics.



'''

===  the Franks 法兰克王国 (481-843年)

==== 墨洛温王朝 (481-751年)

The most successful Germanic kingdom was that of the Franks. Clovis I, a member of the Merovingian dynasty, founded the kingdom in the early sixth century.


A chief source of conflict was the practice of partible inheritance, whereby each son received an equal share of his father’s estate. Estates thus became smaller with each successive generation unless new lands were conquered, often by being taken from siblings, in-laws, or cousins. Kings without land and resources to offer as reward lost the ability to attract fighters.


Real power lay with the aristocrats, and eventually a new dynasty called the Carolingians took control of the Frankish kingdom.


'''

====  加洛林王朝 (751-843年) (佩平捐赠)

With the support of the pope, Pépin le Bref (Pippin the Short) became the first Carolingian king of the Franks, deposing his Merovingian rival. In return, he confirmed a grant of lands in Italy to the pope.

This grant, known as the Donation of Pepin, provided the legal basis for the establishment of the Papal States and helped ensure that the papacy, the set of administrative structures associated with the government of the Catholic Church, was not just a religious institution but also a territorial power.



Their alliance with the popes allowed the Carolingian rulers to work independently of the Byzantine Empire.


'''

====  查理曼大帝 (首次统一了西欧)

Pépin’s son Charles, known as Charlemagne (“Charles the Great”), was the most influential ruler in the early European Middle Ages. He campaigned nearly every year of his reign, uniting western Europe for the first time since the collapse of Roman authority.

On Christmas Day in the year 800, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III. This coronation angered Byzantine rulers and set the stage for conflict between east and west in their quest for prestige and territory.



Charlemagne’s empire did not last.  From the east came nomadic raiders, the Magyars, a non- Germanic people who migrated from the steppes of central Asia. At the end of the ninth century, they settled in what is today Hungary, and from there they launched devastating raids for plunder into Germany.



'''

===  the Vikings 维京人

Perhaps more famous today than the Magyars and Islamic raiders were the Norse who raided northern Europe from Scandinavia, called the Vikings. The peoples of Scandinavia, who spoke Germanic languages, had a culture similar to that of the Germanic peoples who settled in the Roman Empire.


The growth of the population in the eighth century and the relative lack of arable land in Scandinavia compelled groups of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes to travel in search of plunder.

In the west, the arrival of the Norse raiders was less benign. The sudden nature of the violent raids, and the inability of Frankish or Anglo-Saxon armies to defeat them, instilled fear in the population of western Europe.



Eventually, the Norse raiders began to settle in regions rather than just raid them.

- In 865, a substantial army of Vikings invaded Britain and destroyed most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except for Wessex.
- In 911, they settled in northern France, establishing the duchy of Normandy.


Like the earlier Germanic peoples, they eventually converted to Roman Christianity, and their kings began to build more centralized kingdoms that enabled them to curb the violence of the raiders.

==  11-13世纪 → 建立十字军国家 (教皇的国度, 有点像后世清教徒的”山巅之城”理想)

=== Jerusalem 耶路撒冷

Jerusalem drew pilgrims from the three monotheistic religions.


'''


.对"犹太教"来说:

- Jerusalem was the site of the holiest of holies of Judaism, the most sacred of spaces where the Temple of Solomon had stood until its destruction by the Romans.
- Pilgrimage had been obligatory for Jewish people until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, but even after that time, the city continued to play a special role in Jewish life.


.对"基督教"来说:
- In the earliest decades of the first century, it had also become the location for some of the most dramatic and important scenes in the life of Jesus and the early Christian community.
- In the time of Constantine, a church had been built over the site of what was believed to be Jesus’s tomb, called the Holy Sepulchre. As the place where it is believed Jesus was crucified and resurrected, Jerusalem was bound up with the most essential Christian beliefs.


.对"伊斯兰教"来说:
- Muhammad is said to have made a special journey to be able to pray in Jerusalem and to be allowed to glimpse God before he continued his mission to convert others to Islam.
- The Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on the old Temple Mount in Jerusalem, is the third holiest site in the faith, and it is believed to be mentioned several times in the Quran as "the furthest shrine."
- Another shrine, called the Dome of the Rock, was also built near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is associated with Muhammad’s journey and with the biblical Abraham, an important figure to Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike.


'''

===  参加十字军的人的目的

Some may have hoped to gain land if they remained in the Holy Land, and others were motivated simply to see the earthly Jerusalem as a way of experiencing the heavenly Jerusalem that awaited them when they died, and then returned home.


'''

===  十字军的讨伐敌人 : 教皇的所有敌人

The crusading ideal was also transformed by practice and experience. The popes now called holy wars not just to liberate Jerusalem but to fight against the enemies of the church. Crusades were called against non-Christians in the Baltic regions, against heretics in France, and even against the pope’s personal enemies in Italy.


'''

===  十字军理想的消失

Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the crusading ideal declined in popularity. This was due in part to the decline of the power of the papacy and in part to the revival of royal power in the fourteenth century. The Crusades had been launched by popular popes. Over time, they came to seem more concerned about their own power and prestige and less like the hard-working clerics who had battled kings for the freedom of the church.


'''

===  十字军东征的简要介绍

==== 第1次东征

While the Byzantine emperor wanted aid for his realm, Urban instead sent the crusaders to Jerusalem.


The bulk of the First Crusade was directed by powerful aristocrats whose armies were better organized than Peter’s, even if most of its participants were not the most senior nobles of Western society. Alexios promised them aid in exchange for the return of Byzantine territory held by Muslims, which most initially agreed to.  ... straining the relationships between the crusaders and the Byzantine Empire.


The crusading armies then took other important cities in the area, and to secure their control they established the four Crusader States: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. These Crusader States were also called Outremer (literally “overseas”) by the French.


The crusaders organized their government in feudal terms, but the native populations never became serfs owing service to their lords. Instead, they paid their taxes in cash or in goods.


The lack of settlers from Europe ensured that the number of soldiers in Outremer was small. This was why the crusaders built imposing fortresses and castles, like the famous Krak des Chevaliers in Syria.


The Muslims adapted quickly, however. A Turkic aristocrat named Imad al-Din Zengi managed to take the city of Edessa, in the northernmost of the Crusader States. The loss of Edessa posed a serious threat to the remaining Crusader States, however, and prompted the pope to call the Second Crusade.


'''

====  第2次东征

This crusade was led by powerful rulers, including King Louis VII of France and King Conrad III of Germany. The armies of the Second Crusade were defeated in Anatolia in separate battles, and few soldiers reached the Holy Land. The kings accomplished very little, and many blamed the Byzantine emperor, who had learned to be distrustful of European armies.


After this loss, the situation for Outremer only became more dire. Imad al-Din Zengi’s successors were well liked, even by crusaders, and they strove to unite the Muslim princes in jihad. The most famous of these successors was Salah al-Din, or Saladin in the Christian world. He was known for being humane, fair-minded, and, in Christians terms, chivalrous. In 1187, after years of gathering allies and eroding the military power of Outremer, he destroyed the crusaders at the Battle of the Horns of Hattin (in today’s Israel). Within months, Jerusalem fell to Saladin.


The Christians’ response was the Third Crusade (1189–1192).


'''

====  第3次东征

This crusade was prompted both by the fear that Outremer was about to be wiped off the map and by the desire to retake Jerusalem. Kings from England, the Holy Roman Empire, and France as well as other powerful princes answered the call. When they arrived in the last remaining Christian outposts in the Middle East, they quickly fell to squabbling with each other and the aristocracy of Outremer. As a result, the Christians were able to conquer the island of Cyprus and the coastline of the Holy Land but were unable to move farther inland.


Eventually, Richard I of England, known in popular stories as Richard the Lionhearted, negotiated a treaty with Saladin that left Jerusalem under Muslim control but allowed Christian pilgrims to freely visit the city.


'''

====  十字军国家的全部陷落

Later calls for crusades were met with some enthusiasm, but the object of the fight became Egypt, recognized as an important base for controlling the Holy Land.

Nevertheless, later crusades became increasingly French and less successful at accomplishing their goals. The French crusader-king Louis IX led the Seventh and Eighth Crusades against Muslim rulers in North Africa and died of illness there. (He was later canonized as St. Louis.)


When the port city of Acre in present-day Israel fell in 1291, the last of the Crusader States fell with it.

== 动荡的14世纪 → 小冰期, 黑死病, 城市经济的发展

The Fourteenth Century Begins. This map depicts the patchwork of kingdoms and political entities in Europe and beyond at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The many divisions ensured that political fragmentation rather than centralization defined the region throughout the medieval period, and many states depicted here still lacked a strong, centralized rule entirely.

The fourteenth century was generally an era of chronic conflict and instability for most of the continent.



'''

===  小冰期

Because trees can live for hundreds or even thousands of years, during which they experience a variety of environmental fluctuations, clues about these changing conditions are often hidden within the rings in their stumps. The color and width of tree rings can provide snapshots of past climate conditions.


This chart depicts the shift in the Northern Hemisphere’s temperature over the last millennium, including the Medieval Warm Period that began in the tenth century and the Little Ice Age that ran from the fourteenth century to approximately 1850.



There had been a global temperature decrease of 0.6°C, with some areas experiencing as much as a two-degree drop in annual temperature. Despite their global impact, the effects of the Little Ice Age were not the same everywhere.


- In the Mediterranean and West Africa, irregular rainfall and periods of drought dramatically reduced crop yields,
- whereas in China and northern Europe, cold weather and the freezing of lakes and rivers were especially pronounced.
- 而在中国和北欧，寒冷的天气, 以及湖泊和河流的结冰尤为明显。

'''

===  小冰期带来的影响

==== 粮食歉收, 饥荒蔓延

In an era during which many people survived on subsistence agriculture, even the slightest change in seasonal weather patterns could devastate crops and result in widespread malnourishment and starvation.


This led to catastrophic crop failures and widespread famine in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere within the first few decades of the fourteenth century.



'''

==== 政府无法解决灾害问题, 在民众中的公信力下降

Ultimately, the Great Famine led many to question the ability of church officials and monarchs to respond effectively to crises and catastrophes, which had long-term effects on public trust in these institutions.



'''

===  瘟疫 (鼠疫, 黑死病)

==== 患者的症状

The bubonic plague, the most common variant of the disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, raises egg-shaped swellings known as buboes near an afflicted person’s lymph nodes in the groin, underarm, and upper neck areas. For the vast majority in the Middle Ages, death generally occurred within three days.

The disease has a mortality rate ranging from 30 to 80 percent, which is significantly higher than that of the deadliest smallpox, influenza, and polio pandemics of the modern era.


Two even deadlier variants of the disease eventually emerged during the fourteenth century: pneumonic and septicemic.

|pneumonic :
|The pneumonic form directly infected the lungs and was spread from person to person by coughing, with a mortality rate of 95 to 100 percent.
|septicemic :
|The septicemic variant, which resulted from plague bacteria circulating directly into the bloodstream, was invariably fatal and, according to contemporary observers, seemed to kill within hours of the first onset of symptoms.
|===


'''

==== 鼠疫杆菌的传播媒介 → 鼠蚤

Although in its bubonic form the plague could not be spread from human to human, the rat flea became a major plague vector. The black rat was one of the most capable animal hosts for the plague-carrying fleas. It was highly susceptible to the disease itself.

Plague-bearing fleas generally preferred to feed on small rodents such as rats and marmots, but when their rodent hosts succumbed to the plague, they secured their next meal from the nearest human.



'''

====  传播过程

The plague spread into the European interior, leaving perhaps as many as twenty-four million dead, roughly 30 percent of the continent’s population at the time.

After the plague had run its course by the 1350s, it recurred in cyclical fashion several times during the second half of the fourteenth century. It was never fully eradicated.


'''

===  鼠疫对人们思想造成的变化 : 从挣扎到躺平

Social responses to the plague in medieval Europe ranged from increased piety to hedonism to resigned acceptance of inevitable death.


'''

===  鼠疫对社会变化的影响

==== 宗教解决不了实际问题, 因此对教会的信仰下降

Old systems of belief came into question.


Failing to fully grasp how and why the disease was spreading, however, many of the devout turned to the clergy, who were also dying in record numbers, mostly because of their efforts to care for the sick.


The disadvantaged began to question whether social elites really did enjoy God’s privilege, as the social hierarchy generally preached, since they too succumbed to the plague and failed to care for those to whom they bore responsibility.


'''

====  人口下降, 劳动力市场供小于求,  使底层人民更有能力, 来和上层谈条件, 争取更多权力.

Given massive depopulation, peasants left the feudal estates on which their families had lived for generations, as landlords elsewhere offered more generous terms of labor to attract workers who could replace the dead. Because the demand for labor was so high, peasants who remained in the countryside, especially males, were now able to press their employers for more money and rights.


'''

====  ①农奴人口下降, 导致封建贵族的权力下降, 君主权力上升. ②农民进入城市找工作, 促进城市经济兴起, 进而带来商人阶层出现.

Many peasants also left the countryside to seek wage labor and employment in cities, which began experiencing significant labor shortages as a result of the plague’s staggering death toll.


With fewer people to work their land and generate income for them, their collective wealth contracted significantly. The power of local nobles and landowners was also being eclipsed by more powerful monarchs and emerging urban economies that bolstered the growth of towns and cities.


The death of many members of the clergy during the Black Death made monarchs more dependent on the merchant class to perform services for which education was required. The rising prominence of the merchant class that resulted.


'''

===  英法国百年战争（1337-1453）

The Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453) erupted between England and France over claims to French lands held by the English monarch.


'''

===  神圣罗马帝国

Another center of political instability during this period was the Holy Roman Empire.


In the fourteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire, which had been founded by Charlemagne in 800, comprised four main entities—the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Germany (including lands that now are part of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), the Kingdom of Burgundy (a region in southeastern France), and the Kingdom of Bohemia (what is now the Czech Republic and part of Poland) under the nominal control of an elected emperor. Each of these kingdoms, in turn, was composed of a loose coalition of independent territories with different hereditary rulers.

Rather than adopting a common currency, legal system, or representative assembly, the Holy Roman Empire remained a patchwork of semiautonomous principalities. Although each of these became relatively stable, the empire itself was a weak and decentralized political entity.

By the end of the fourteenth century, it included more than one hundred principalities, each with varying degrees of power and autonomy.
