== 俄国与英国争夺殖民地 (1850 年代 - 1870 年代)

British attempts to gain control over regions of Asia beyond India and Hong Kong were often frustrated by Russia, which also sought to expand its influence there. The ongoing struggle between the two was called The Great Game.

英国试图控制印度和香港以外的亚洲地区的努力, 常常遭到俄国的挫败，俄国也试图扩大其在该地区的影响力。两国之间持续不断的斗争被称为“伟大的博弈” 。

From the 1850s through the 1870s, Russia gained control of kingdoms occupied by Turkic-speaking peoples in central Asia and incorporated them into its empire as a region called Turkestan. Britain feared Russia would try to absorb India as well. To protect its prized possession, Britain sought to use the Emirate of Afghanistan as a buffer zone.

When Russia gained control of much of what is now Turkmenistan in 1881, the two European nations jointly established the boundary line between an independent Afghanistan and Russian territory, ending a serious conflict between the two powers.

从 1850 年代到 1870 年代，俄国控制了中亚突厥语民族占领的王国，并将其纳入其帝国，称为"突厥斯坦"地区. 英国担心俄国也会试图吞并印度。为了保护其珍贵的财产，英国寻求利用"阿富汗酋长国"作为缓冲区。

1881年，当俄罗斯控制了现在的土库曼斯坦大部分地区时，这两个欧洲国家共同在独立的阿富汗和俄罗斯领土之间, 划定了边界线，结束了两国之间的严重冲突。

==  成立杜马 (国家立法机构) (1906)

On January 5, 1905, many workers gathered to protest peacefully outside Tsar Nicholas II’s Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. They were led by a local cleric and appealed to the tsar (who was not in residence) for improvements to their working conditions, as well as a government that would share power with a popularly elected assembly.

1905年1月5日，许多工人聚集在"圣彼得堡"沙皇尼古拉二世"冬宫"外进行和平抗议。他们由当地一名神职人员领导，呼吁沙皇（当时不在居住地）改善他们的工作条件，并呼吁建立一个与"民选议会"分享权力的政府。

Workers in numerous cities went on strike to protest the bloodshed as part of the Revolution of 1905. Many strikes turned violent as more troops were ordered to put them down.

作为 1905 年革命的一部分，许多城市的工人举行罢工，抗议流血事件。 当更多的军队奉命镇压，许多罢工演变成了暴力。

With no end in sight, Nicholas II was forced to concede that he would no longer rule autocratically, and that a national legislature would meet to create a new voice in the government. The legislature was called the Duma and first met in 1906. It was composed of middleclass men and peasants, but it had two houses. One was indirectly chosen by an electoral college whose members were selected by men over age twenty-five. The other house had members appointed by the tsar. This second house dominated the Duma, limiting the legislature’s ability to function as a true representative assembly. While it was a step forward in line with some revolutionary aims, it did not signal a true sharing of power by the tsar.

由于看不到尽头，尼古拉二世被迫承认他将不再实行独裁统治，"国家立法机构"将开会在政府中发出新的声音。立法机关称为"杜马"，于 1906 年首次召开。它由中产阶级男子和农民组成，但有两院组成。其中一院是由"选举团"间接选出的，选举团成员从25岁以上的男性选出。另一院的成员由沙皇任命。第二议院主导了杜马，限制了立法机关作为"真正的代表议会"发挥作用的能力。虽然这(杜马的出现)是朝着一些革命目标迈出的一步，但它并不意味着沙皇真正分享了权力。

==  沙皇退位后新成立的临时政府, 和苏维埃, 进行夺权

The soldiers formed the Petrograd Soviet (a council representing workers, soldiers, and peasants) to establish power in the city. A group of moderate politicians then established a new government for Russia under the auspices of the Duma. This provisional government was led by Alexander Kerensky, a lawyer who had become popular for assisting revolutionaries in the past. Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate, paving the way for the end of three hundred years of Romanov rule.

士兵们组建了"彼得格勒苏维埃"（一个代表工人、士兵和农民的"委员会"）, 在城市中建立政权。随后，一群温和的政治家在"杜马"的支持下建立了一个新政府。这个临时政府由亚历山大·克伦斯基（Alexander Kerensky）领导，他是一位律师, 过去因协助革命者而广受欢迎。沙皇尼古拉二世被迫退位，为结束"罗曼诺夫"三百年的统治铺平了道路。

Kerensky was dedicated to continuing Russia’s participation in World War I, partly because he feared that aid he needed from the West to support Russia’s economy would be lost if he withdrew from the conflict. However, this position became increasingly unpopular with the Russian people. The provisional government and the Petrograd Soviet (which was becoming more anti-war) then vied for power in Russia.

"克伦斯基"致力于让俄国继续参与第一次世界大战，部分原因是他担心，如果他退出战争，他将失去"西方对俄国的经济援助"。然而，这一立场越来越不受俄国人民的欢迎。随后，临时政府和"彼得格勒苏维埃"（变得更加反战）, 开始争夺俄国权力。

==  列宁政变夺权 (1917年十月革命)

Germany saw an opportunity to take advantage of Russia’s disintegrating political situation. A young Russian named Vladimir Ilyich Lenin had supported the cause of revolution in his native country for many years. Lenin had then left Russia, branded a radical and forced into exile. Germany helped him return to Russia to energize the revolution there and undermine the tsarist government’s conduct of the war.

德国决定利用俄国的政治分裂, 让俄国退出一战. 因此帮助列宁回国. 列宁当时处在流亡状态中.

Lenin quickly became the leader of the revolutionary cause, and the group he led, the Bolsheviks, challenged Kerensky’s provisional government. In the October Revolution in 1917, Lenin led a coup and seized power from the other political factions in Petrograd.

Capitalizing on a campaign of “Peace, Land, Bread,” Lenin’s government moved to end the war with Germany. Germany was only too happy to work out an agreement that would allow it to focus solely on the war on its western front.

列宁很快成为革命事业的领袖，他领导的布尔什维克集团, 向克伦斯基的临时政府发起挑战。 1917年十月, 列宁领导政变(即所谓的”十月革命”)，从彼得格勒其他政治派别手中, 夺取了政权。列宁政府利用“和平、土地、面包”运动, 结束了与德国的战争。 德国非常高兴能够达成一项协议，使其能够专注于西部战线的战争。

Lenin’s goal was to end the fighting as quickly as possible, so he agreed to terms that were fairly advantageous for Germany and the Central powers. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on March 3, 1918. In it, Russia gave up significant territory to the Central powers, including areas of Poland and Ukraine, Finland, and the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia), which gave Germany new ports. In return, Russia was able to end its participation in the war as Lenin focused on building a Communist state, the Soviet Union.

列宁的目标是尽快结束战斗，因此他同意了对德奥一方相当有利的条件。 1918 年 3 月 3 日签署了 《布列斯特-立托夫斯克条约》。在该条约中，俄罗斯将大片领土让给德奥一方，包括波兰和乌克兰、芬兰以及波罗的海国家（立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚）的地区。给了德国新的港口。作为回报，俄国得以结束对战争的参与，让列宁专注于建设共产主义国家苏联。

==  列宁击败反苏维埃势力 (1923)

In 1918, after being held under house arrest for two years, the former tsar, his wife, and their five children were executed. A civil war broke out that year pitting the White Army, which opposed Lenin, against the Red Army, which supported the Bolshevik government. This conflict lasted until 1923, when the Red Army proved victorious.

1918年，在被软禁两年后，前沙皇、他的妻子和他们的五个孩子被处决。那年爆发了一场内战，反对列宁的白军, 与支持"布尔什维克政府"的红军之间, 展开了斗争。这场冲突一直持续到1923年，红军取得了胜利。

After the Bolshevik seizure of the government and Russia’s hasty departure from World War I, Lenin moved to consolidate power in Russia. Civil war raged from 1918 to 1921 between the Red Army of the Bolsheviks and the White Army representing all the groups that opposed them, including the Russian upper classes, forces loyal to the monarchy, and Lenin’s enemies within the Russian Social Democrats, such as the Menshevik faction. Members of the White Army disagreed on whether they sought an anti-Bolshevik communist government or the return of a tsarist government. The Red Army, though smaller, had a focused goal and was better organized.

British, French, Japanese, and U.S. troops all invaded Russia in support of the White Army and stayed until 1920, but they were unable to stop the Bolsheviks from seizing control. The civil war ended in 1921 with the Bolsheviks in control. Approximately 1.5 million soldiers had died in the fighting, but the civilian death toll was substantially higher—about eight million.

在布尔什维克夺取政府和俄罗斯仓促退出第一次世界大战后，列宁开始巩固俄罗斯的权力。 1918年至 1921年，布尔什维克的红军, 和代表所有反对他们的群体的白军之间, 爆发了内战，其中包括俄罗斯上层阶级、忠于君主制的势力, 以及列宁在俄罗斯"社会民主党"内部的敌人，例如孟什维克派。白军成员对于是否寻求"反布尔什维克的共产主义政府"或"沙皇政府的回归"存在分歧。红军虽然规模较小，但目标明确，组织较好。

英国、法国、日本和美国军队纷纷入侵俄罗斯, 支持白军，并一直呆到1920年，但无法阻止布尔什维克夺取政权。 1921 年，内战结束，布尔什维克掌权。大约有 150 万士兵在战斗中死亡，但平民死亡人数要高得多，大约有 800 万。

'''

==  苏联开始控制其他国家

During the civil war, Lenin and the Bolshevik leadership also sought to take over lands outside Russia that had been controlled by the now-deposed tsar. Lenin approached these regions with the goal of creating a federal state of republics governed by a soviet, an elected committee of workers’ representatives. Each republic in this new “Soviet Union” would represent an ethnicity and be nominally independent but ultimately under the central government’s control.

Many of these areas fiercely resisted incorporation by the Bolsheviks. In 1919, the Red Army invaded Ukraine and faced strong resistance. Both Ukraine and Belarus had some autonomy but had to rely on Lenin’s government to direct foreign policy. Other areas, like the Caucasus, proved more contentious.

内战期间，列宁和布尔什维克领导层, 还试图接管俄罗斯境外的, 曾被之前沙皇控制的土地。目的是建立一个由苏维埃（一个选举产生的工人代表委员会）统治的联邦共和国。这个新“苏联”中的每个共和国都代表一个民族，名义上独立，但最终受中央政府控制。

其中许多地区强烈抵制布尔什维克的合并。1919年，红军入侵乌克兰，遭到强大抵抗. 乌克兰和白俄罗斯都拥有一定的自治权，但必须依靠列宁政府 来指导外交政策。其他地区，如高加索地区，争议更大。

In 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was established.

1922年，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（苏联）成立。

==  斯大林掌权

Lenin’s death in 1924 opened a power vacuum and a debate over the future of policy in the Soviet Union. There were two very different paths the country could follow. Favoring one path were leaders such as Leon Trotsky, the man responsible for making the Red Army a dependable fighting force during the civil war. Stalin, then in his forties, strove to keep out of these specific debates. He and Trotsky held opposing views on communist ideology and the future of the Soviet Union.

In 1927, Stalin expelled Trotsky from the Communist Party. In 1929, Trotsky was forced into exile. He was assassinated by a Soviet agent in Mexico in 1940.

1924 年列宁去世, 引发了权力真空, 和关于苏联政策未来的争论。该国可以走两条截然不同的道路。支持其中的一条道路的是"托洛茨基"等领导人，他在内战期间使红军成为一支可靠的战斗力量 。当时四十多岁的斯大林竭力回避这些具体的争论。但他和"托洛茨基"对共产主义意识形态和苏联的未来, 持有相反的看法.

1927年，斯大林将"托洛茨基"开除出共产党。 1929年，托洛茨基被迫流亡。 1940 年，他在墨西哥被一名苏联特工暗杀。

'''

== 强制性的集体化政策, 使经济受损, 造成苏联大饥荒

Stalin speeded the drive to collectivization, and local officials did what they could to comply with the new targets for grain collection. By 1939, more than 90 percent of the peasants had been forced to live and work on collective farms. If they resisted, they could be arrested, and many were sent to labor camps in Siberia. While some poor peasants complied with collectivization because they had little of their own property to lose, middle-class peasants continued to oppose it, even killing their livestock rather than turning flocks over to the Soviet government.

斯大林加快了集体化进程，地方官员也竭尽全力完成新的粮食征收目标。到1939年，90%以上的农民被迫在集体农场生活和工作。如果他们反抗，他们可能会被逮捕，许多人被送往西伯利亚的劳改营。 虽然一些贫苦农民因为自己的财产几乎没有什么可损失的, 而同意集体化，但中产阶级农民仍然反对集体化，甚至杀死他们的牲畜，而不是把羊群交给苏维埃政府。

More than half the nation’s livestock was lost under collectivization in the 1930s, and the numbers did not recover until the 1950s. In some areas, spring planting did not occur due to the upheaval.

The failures of collectivization spelled deaths for millions in the Soviet Union. Approximately two million died resisting or in prison, and between five and ten million additional lives were lost in a famine caused by the chaos of the process, the peasants’ choice to slaughter their livestock, and government policies that took food from the peasants.

20世纪30年代集体化, 导致全国一半以上的牲畜损失，直到1950年代这一数字才恢复。在一些地区，由于动乱，春季播种没有进行。

集体化的失败, 导致苏联数百万人死亡。大约有 200 万人死于抵抗或在监狱中，另外 5 至 1000 万人死于饥荒，原因是过程的混乱、农民选择宰杀牲畜, 以及政府从农民手中夺走食物的政策。

'''

==  斯大林进行大清洗, 消灭异己者

The problems surrounding collectivization also led many within the Communist Party to question the wisdom of Stalin’s decisions.

In 1934, the assassination of Sergei Kirov, a high-ranking Soviet politician, led to an investigation that uncovered what Stalin believed was a plot to kill him. Kirov’s death, together with the unrest caused by collectivization, the anti-Soviet rhetoric of Germany’s Nazi Party (which had taken control of Germany in 1933), and his knowledge that many Soviet politicians did not share his vision of the USSR’s future, fed Stalin’s growing feelings of paranoia. His belief that he was surrounded by enemies led to a reign of terror in which the Soviet secret police arrested millions of Soviet citizens on suspicion of disloyalty. Many were sent to prison camps in Siberia where they perished as a result of starvation and overwork. Some were executed immediately following brief trials. Some did not even receive trials. Historians disagree about how many Soviets died as a result of the political purges of the 1930s, but one million is a likely figure.

围绕集体化的问题, 也导致共产党内部许多人质疑斯大林决策的明智性。1934 年，苏联高级政治家"谢尔盖·基洛夫" (Sergei Kirov)遇刺，引发了一项调查，斯大林被认为是阴谋刺杀了他。

基洛夫之死，加上"集体化"引起的骚乱、德国纳粹党（1933年控制了德国）的反苏言论，以及斯大林知道许多苏联政客并不认同"他对苏联未来的看法"，助长了他日益增长的偏执情绪。斯大林相信自己被敌人包围，于是他发动了恐怖统治，苏联秘密警察以涉嫌不忠为由逮捕了数百万苏联公民。许多人被送往西伯利亚的战俘营，在那里因饥饿和过度劳累而死亡。有些人在短暂审判后立即被处决。有些甚至没有接受审判。历史学家对于 1930 年代的政治清洗造成多少苏联人死亡的说法不一，但可能有 100 万人死亡。
