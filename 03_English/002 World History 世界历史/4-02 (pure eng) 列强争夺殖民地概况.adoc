== 17世纪的美洲殖民地争夺概况

The Spanish were the first to establish major colonies in North America after Christopher Columbus’s arrival in 1492.

In the early 1500s, Europeans began founding new settlements in the Americas.

Europe’s Footprint in the Americas. By the early seventeenth century, Spain, Portugal, England, France, and the Netherlands all had established colonies in the Americas. Spain’s empire was the largest.

As the fortunes of Spain and Portugal declined in the seventeenth century, England, France, and the Netherlands claimed territory in Asia and the Americas and established their own trading posts on the African coast.

===  加勒比海岛屿情况

Although the mainland colonies yielded wealth for the European home countries, the chief prizes were the islands of the Caribbean where sugar could be grown.

Over the course of the seventeenth century, England, France, and the Netherlands set up colonies throughout the Caribbean on islands either not claimed by Spain or taken from it.

===  中南美洲情况

The three attempted to found colonies in Central or South America as well, but Spanish and Portuguese dominance there either made these efforts unsuccessful, like the Dutch attempts in Brazil, or they kept the colonies small, such as French Guiana and Dutch Guiana, now Suriname.

==  第二次”工业革命”时非洲殖民地概况

At the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution, Europeans controlled about 10 percent of the African continent. By the end of the century, they controlled 90 percent, with the largest portions ruled by Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany. Portugal and Spain still claimed colonies acquired in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

The “Scramble for Africa” reached its height during the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 when, without input from Africans, European nations simply allotted different parts of the continent to one another. Some agreements were formal recognitions of existing colonies and territories, while others recognized new claims.

In Africa, borders charted to benefit imperialist powers often separated members of the same ethnic group into different countries while forcing hostile groups into the same country. Violent ethnic conflict has been a frequent result.

Colonization continued throughout the 1880s–1910s.

==  18世纪开始, 对太平洋殖民地的争夺概况

Colonization of the Pacific by Europeans had begun as early as the sixteenth century when Spain claimed the Philippines.

Over the course of the eighteenth through the early nineteenth centuries, France and Britain had also laid claim to the islands of the Pacific.

Britain established a colony in Australia in 1788 and colonized New Zealand in 1840.

France made Tahiti a protectorate in 1842.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, those islands that did not already belong to a great power were quickly absorbed into larger colonial empires.

==  19世纪前半段

The hundred years after 1750 marked a profound restructuring of world power and a host of political and economic changes in the Atlantic world. The Revolutionary War (1776–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), and the Peninsular War (1808–1814) were watershed events that reverberated across South America on inspiring waves of revolutionary upheavals.

In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, most European American colonies gained their independence.

==  美, 德, 日, 寻求海外殖民地 (19世纪后期开始)

The United States, Germany, and Japan lacked overseas colonies and now sought to acquire them.


In some cases, competing powers agreed to share possession of large islands or island chains. For example, in 1899, Germany, Britain, and the United States formally agreed to divide the Samoan islands between Germany, which took control of those now known as Samoa, and the United States, which received those now called American Samoa. In exchange for Britain’s forfeiting any claim to the islands, Germany gave it control of some of the territory it had settled in the North Solomon Islands and made concessions regarding its holdings in Africa.

==  列强在中国争夺”半殖民地”的概况

Following China’s defeat in 1895, European nations and the United States pushed for even more advantages. France gained control over the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan. Britain extended its influence along the Yangtze River Valley. Germany was given control of the Yellow River Valley to the north as well as the Shandong Peninsula and Jiaozhou Bay. Soon nearly all the industrialized nations had been granted concessions, enclaves within port cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai, where they exercised the rights of extraterritoriality.
