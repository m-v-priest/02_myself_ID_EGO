== 古罗马

=== 经济

Despite these attempts at collecting taxes, by the third century CE the empire had entered a period of financial crisis. Constant wars meant a never-ending need to sustain large armies. As less new land was acquired, troop payments came more often from the central treasury than from newly conquered territory.

尽管有这些收税的尝试，但到了公元三世纪，帝国还是进入了金融危机时期。持续不断的战争意味着永远需要维持庞大的军队。由于获得的新土地减少，部队付款更多地来自中央财政部，而不是来自新征服的领土。

'''

===  古罗马的建立

According to Roman tradition, the city was founded in 753 BCE by the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars, the god of war.

根据罗马传统，这座城市是由战神马尔斯的儿子, 罗穆卢斯和雷穆斯双胞胎兄弟, 于公元前 753 年建立的.

The Roman city-state free itself from Etruscan domination and establish an independent republic around 500 BCE.

罗马城邦摆脱了伊特鲁里亚人的统治，并在公元前 500 年左右, 建立了一个独立的共和国。

The early Romans did not plan on building an immense empire. They were surrounded by hostile city-states and tribes, and in the process of defeating them they made new enemies even as they expanded their network of allies. Thus they were constantly sending armies farther afield to crush these threats until Rome emerged in the second century BCE as the most powerful state in all the lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

早期罗马人并不打算建立一个庞大的帝国。他们被敌对的城邦和部落所包围，在打败他们的过程中，他们在扩大盟友网络的同时也结交了新的敌人。因此，他们不断向更远的地方派遣军队来粉碎这些威胁，直到公元前二世纪罗马成为地中海沿岸最强大的国家。

===  打败迦太基 (布匿战争)

After conquering most of the Italian peninsula, Rome came to challenge the other major power in the region, Carthage. A series of wars ensued, called the Punic Wars, in which Rome and Carthage vied for dominance.

在征服了意大利半岛的大部分地区之后，罗马开始挑战该地区的另一个强国迦太基。随后发生了一系列战争，称为布匿战争，罗马和迦太基争夺统治地位。(迦太基必须毁灭)

'''

====  第一次布匿战争

the First Punic War (264–241 BCE) ended with Rome annexing Sicily.

第一次布匿战争（公元前 264-241 年），战争以罗马吞并西西里岛而结束。

'''

==== 第二次布匿战争

Carthage desired revenge. In the Second Punic War (218–201 BCE), As the Carthaginian general Hannibal’s army was rampaging through Italy, Rome sent an army across the Mediterranean to Africa to attack Carthage, which summoned Hannibal back to defend his homeland.

迦太基渴望复仇。在第二次布匿战争（公元前 218-201 年）中，当迦太基将军汉尼拔的军队横行意大利时，罗马派遣军队穿越地中海进入非洲进攻迦太基本土，迫使迦太基召唤汉尼拔回来保卫本土.

Carthage sued for peace and was stripped of all its overseas territory. Rome thus acquired Carthage’s lands in Hispania.

(最后, )迦太基求和，被剥夺了所有海外领土。罗马因此获得了迦太基在西班牙的土地。

'''

====  消灭马其顿王国

During the war, King Philip V of Macedon made an alliance with Carthage. After Rome’s victory against Carthage, Rome declared war against this new enemy. Philip suffered a defeat and lacked the resources to continue. Consequently, he agreed to become an ally of Rome. Rome also liberated all regions in Greece formerly under Macedonian control.

Rome discovered in the second century BCE that there was no end to the threats from hostile powers. Perseus, the son of Philip V, renounced the alliance with Rome. Roman armies invaded Macedon, which soon afterward became a Roman province.

战争期间，马其顿国王菲利普五世与迦太基结盟。罗马战胜迦太基后，罗马向这个新敌人宣战。菲利普战败，缺乏继续作战的资源。因此，他同意成为罗马的盟友。罗马还解放了以前在马其顿控制下的希腊所有地区。

公元前二世纪，罗马发现来自敌对势力的威胁永无止境。腓力五世之子珀尔修斯宣布放弃与罗马的联盟。罗马军队入侵马其顿，马其顿很快成为罗马的一个行省。

'''

====  第三次布匿战争 (前149年－前146年)

Roman armies also destroyed the city of Carthage in the Third Punic War.

罗马军队还在第三次布匿战争中摧毁了迦太基城.

'''

===  the First Triumvirate 前三头执政同盟 (Julius Caesar 凯撒)

Three men in particular eventually assumed enormous dominance. One was Pompey Magnus. Another politician and military commander of this era was Crassus. The third influential figure was Julius Caesar.

特别是三个人最终取得了巨大的统治地位。其中之一是庞培·马格努斯. 这个时代的另一位政治家和军事统帅是克拉苏。第三位有影响力的人物是 尤利乌斯·凯撒.

The optimates in the Senate distrusted all these men and cooperated to block their influence in Roman politics. In response, in 60 BCE the three decided to join forces to advance their interests through a political alliance known to history as the First Triumvirate (“rule by three men”). But they were all very ambitious and each greatly distrusted the others.

元老院的元老们不信任这些人，并合作阻止他们对罗马政治的影响。作为回应，公元前 60 年，三人决定联合起来，通过历史上称为“第一三头政治”（“三人统治”）的政治联盟, 来推进各自的利益。但他们都雄心勃勃，而且彼此不信任。

'''

====  Julius Caesar 凯撒

After serving as consul in 60 BCE, Julius Caesar took command of the Roman army in Gaul (modern France). Over the next ten years, his armies conquered all Gaul and launched attacks against German tribes across the Rhine, and on the island of Britain across the English Channel.

公元前 60 年担任"执政官"后，朱利叶斯·凯撒指挥了高卢（现代法国）的罗马军队。在接下来的十年里，他的军队征服了整个高卢，并对莱茵河对岸的日耳曼部落, 和英吉利海峡对岸的不列颠岛, 发起进攻。

'''

====  Crassus 克拉苏

The Roman people were awed by Caesar’s military success, and Pompey and Crassus grew jealous of his popularity. In 54 BCE, Crassus invaded the Parthian Kingdom in central Asia, hoping for similar military and political triumphs. The invasion was a disaster, however, and Crassus was captured by the Parthians and executed.

罗马人民对凯撒的军事成就感到敬畏，而庞培和克拉苏则, 对他的受欢迎程度感到嫉妒。公元前 54 年，克拉苏入侵中亚的帕提亚王国，希望获得类似的军事和政治胜利。然而，这次入侵是一场灾难，克拉苏被帕提亚人俘虏并处决.

'''

====  Pompey Magnus 庞培

After Crassus’s death, Pompey decided to break with Caesar and support his old enemies the optimates. In 49 BCE, the optimates and Pompey controlled the Senate and demanded that Caesar disband his army in Gaul and return to Rome to stand trial on various charges. Instead, Caesar convinced his client army to march on Rome. In January of that year he famously led his troops across the Rubicon River, the traditional boundary between Italy and Gaul. Since Caesar knew this move would trigger war, as it was illegal to bring a private army into Rome proper, the phrase “crossing the Rubicon” continues to mean “passing the point of no return.”

In 48 BCE, Caesar defeated Pompey.

克拉苏死后，庞培决定与凯撒决裂，转而支持他的宿敌贵族派。公元前49年，元老院和庞培控制了元老院，要求凯撒解散他在高卢的军队，并返回罗马接受各种指控的审判。然而, 凯撒说服他的客户军队向罗马进军。那年一月，他率领部队越过卢比孔河，这是意大利和高卢之间的传统边界。凯撒知道此举会引发战争，因为将私人军队带入罗马本土是非法的，因此“跨越卢比孔河”一词,如今就意味着“越过不归路”。

公元前48年，凯撒击败了庞培。

'''

====  凯撒成为终身独裁者

To prosecute the war against Pompey, Caesar had himself appointed dictator in 48 BCE. Despite the tradition that dictatorship was to be temporary, Caesar’s position was indefinite. In 46 BCE, he was appointed dictator for a term of ten years, and in 44 BCE his dictatorship was made permanent, or for life.

为了对庞培发动战争，凯撒于公元前 48 年任命自己为独裁者(第一次任命)。尽管传统上认为独裁统治是暂时的，但凯撒的位置却是无限期的。公元前 46 年，他被任命为独裁者(第二次任命)，任期十年，并于公元前 44 年，他的独裁统治成为永久性的，即终身独裁。

These appointments and other efforts to accumulate power unnerved many Romans, who had a deep and abiding distrust of autocratic rulers. Caesar had hoped to win over his former enemies by inviting them to serve again in the Senate and appointing them to positions in his government. However, these former optimates viewed him as a tyrant, and in 44 BCE two of them, Brutus and Cassius, led a conspiracy that resulted in his assassination.

这些任命和其他积累权力的努力, 让许多罗马人感到不安，他们对 裁统治者抱有深深而持久的不信任. 凯撒曾希望通过邀请他们再次在元老院任职, 并任命他们在政府中担任职务, 来赢得他以前的敌人的支持。然而，这些前贵族派, 将他视为暴君，公元前 44 年，其中两人布鲁图斯和卡西乌斯领导了一场阴谋，导致凯撒被暗杀。

===  the Second Triumvirate 后三头同盟  (Octavian 屋大维)

Octavian was only eighteen when Caesar was killed, but as Caesar’s adopted son and heir he enjoyed the loyalty and political support of Caesar’s military veterans. Together these three shared the power of dictator in Rome in a political arrangement known as the Second Triumvirate. Unlike the First Triumvirate, which was effectively a conspiracy, the Second Triumvirate was formally recognized by the Senate.

凯撒被杀时，屋大维只有十八岁，但作为凯撒的养子和继承人，他享有凯撒退伍军人的忠诚和政治支持。屋大维与两位经验丰富的将军和政治家, 马克·安东尼和雷必达联手，他们都是凯撒的忠实支持者。这三个人在被称为"后三头同盟"的政治安排中, 共同分享罗马独裁者的权力。与实际上是阴谋集团的"第一三头同盟"不同，后三头同盟得到了元老院的正式承认。

After crushing the remnants of the optimates, the three men divided the Roman Empire between them. Soon they quarreled, however, and civil war erupted once again.

在粉碎了贵族派的残余势力后，这三个人瓜分了罗马帝国. 然而很快他们就发生了争吵，内战再次爆发。

To avoid the fate of his adopted father, he successfully maintained a façade that the Roman Republic was alive and well. Octavian, traditionally referred to as Augustus after 27 BCE, had assumed enormous power. Despite his claim that he had restored the Republic, he had in fact inaugurated the Empire.

为了避免重蹈养父的覆辙(独裁者身份, 导致罗马民众反对, 暗杀独裁者)，屋大维成功地维持了罗马共和国还活着、运转良好的假象. 但屋大维（传统上在 公元前 27 年之后被称为奥古斯都）已经掌握了巨大的权力。尽管他声称自己恢复了共和国，但实际上他开创了帝国.

Augustus was keenly aware that the peace and prosperity he had created was largely built upon his image and power, and he feared what might happen when he died. As a result, the last few decades of his life were spent arranging for a political successor. This was a complicated matter since there was neither an official position of emperor nor a republican tradition of hereditary rule.

Augustus had no son of his own, and his attempts to groom others to take control were repeatedly frustrated when his proposed successors died before him. Before his own death in 14 CE, Augustus arranged for his stepson Tiberius to receive from the Senate the power of a proconsul and a tribune. While not his first choice, Tiberius was an accomplished military leader with senatorial support.

奥古斯都深知他所创造的和平与繁荣, 在很大程度上是建立在他的形象和(独裁者)权力之上的，他担心自己死后(罗马帝国)会发生什么。因此，他生命的最后几十年都在安排政治继承人。这是一个复杂的问题，因为当时既没有正式的皇帝职位，也没有共和制的世袭传统。

奥古斯都没有自己的儿子，而他试图培养其他人接管权力的努力屡屡受挫，因为他提议的继承人都在他之前去世了。在公元14年去世之前，奥古斯都安排元老院授予他的继子提比略保民官和执政官的权力。虽然提比略并非他的首选，但他是一位有成就的军事领袖，并得到了元老院的支持。

chatgpt:

没有正式的”皇帝”职位 (an official position of emperor) ：在奥古斯都的时代，罗马共和国并没有设立“皇帝”这一正式职位。尽管奥古斯都被称为“皇帝”（Imperator）或“首席公民”（Princeps），但这些称号并不是官方承认的皇帝职位。罗马的政治体制更倾向于共和制，决策主要由元老院和公民大会进行，因此没有明确的”皇帝”职位, 也就更谈不上有”皇帝职位的继承”制度。

没有共和制的”世袭”传统 (a republican tradition of hereditary rule)：在罗马共和国时期，权力的继承主要是通过选举, 而非世袭。

因此, 奥古斯都找继承人, 就面临: ①较难让自己的儿子来做继承人 (因为罗马共和国没有世袭制), ②继承人没法以”皇帝”身份来当 (因为那时的罗马, 没有”皇帝”这种职位).

Problems with imperial inheritance remained. There were always risks that a hereditary ruler might prove incompetent.

(即使奥古斯都选择的继承人, 让元老院同意了, ) 但帝国继承问题仍然存在。世袭统治者无能的风险始终存在。(只要是人治, 而非民主选举的国家, 如中国, 皇帝是明君还是昏君, 智慧还是痴呆, 就只能完全靠基因等运气来听天由命了)

'''

=== 动荡和变革的三世纪

The third century was a period of upheaval and change for the Roman government, often referred to as the Crisis of the Third Century. From 235 to 284, a span of only forty-nine years, the empire was ruled by upward of twenty-six different claimants to the imperial throne. New emperors were often declared and supported by Roman soldiers. As a result, civil wars—as well as wars on the eastern frontier—were nearly constant.

三世纪是罗马政府的动荡和变革时期，通常被称为三世纪危机。从公元235年到公元284年，仅仅49年的时间里，帝国就被多达26个不同的皇位继承者统治着。新皇帝常常得到罗马士兵的宣布和支持。结果，内战, 以及东部边境的战争, 几乎持续不断。

'''

===  日耳曼人入侵, 罗马帝国西部沦陷, 罗马帝国重心向东移动 (Constantinople 君士坦丁堡)

Germanic Kingdoms.

The increasing influx of Germanic peoples into the western empire brought about a fracturing of Roman power as a series of independent kingdoms took control of the Italian peninsula.

日耳曼王国。日耳曼人越来越多地涌入西罗马帝国，一系列独立的(日耳曼)王国控制了意大利半岛，这导致了罗马帝国权力的瓦解。

image:/img/0014.jpg[,100%]

Many of the migrations of Germanic peoples during this period were a result of the influx of the Huns. These migrations eventually pushed Germanic groups and others into Roman territory, with the Huns led by their ruler, Attila.

Although the Huns reached as far as Gaul, their empire ultimately collapsed following Attila’s death in 454.

在此期间，迫使许多日耳曼民族的迁徙的原因, 都是匈奴人涌入的结果。这些匈奴移民最终将日耳曼群体和其他群体推入罗马领土，他们的统治者是阿提拉。

尽管匈奴人的疆域远至高卢，但他们的帝国最终在454年阿提拉去世后崩溃。

'''

===  法兰克人

Roman troops were likewise pushed out of Britain for the final time by the invasion of Germanic peoples who included the Angles and the Saxons. Coming from modernday southern Denmark and northern Germany, they occupied southern Britain in the late fifth century. Originally two distinct groups, they are more commonly known as Anglo-Saxons, a name applied to them in the eighth century to distinguish them from similarly named Germanic groups on the European continent.

这一时期的其他日耳曼移民群体, 在高卢定居，其中包括法兰克人。法兰克王国曾经是罗马帝国的盟友，他们最终驱逐了罗马人，并以某种形式统治该地区，直到九世纪。

'''

===  盎格鲁人和撒克逊人

Roman troops were likewise pushed out of Britain for the final time by the invasion of Germanic peoples who included the Angles and the Saxons. Coming from modernday southern Denmark and northern Germany, they occupied southern Britain in the late fifth century. Originally two distinct groups, they are more commonly known as Anglo-Saxons, a name applied to them in the eighth century to distinguish them from similarly named Germanic groups on the European continent.

同样，由于包括盎格鲁人和撒克逊人在内的日耳曼民族的入侵，罗马军队最后一次被赶出英国。他们来自现代丹麦南部和德国北部，在五世纪末占领了英国南部。最初这两个群体是不同的，但在八世纪时，他们更常被称为盎格鲁-撒克逊人，这个名称是为了将他们与欧洲大陆上同名的日耳曼族群区分开来。


The eastern half of the Roman Empire did not collapse until the fifteenth century. Traditionally, though, the end of the empire is fixed at 476, when a German general named Odoacer deposed the emperor Romulus Augustulus and established himself not as a Roman emperor but as King of Italy. Even that date may be arbitrary, but by the late fifth century, traditional Roman authority had ceased to be the basis of political power in much of western Europe.

(虽然)罗马帝国的东半部直到十五世纪才崩溃。不过传统上，帝国的终结被定为在 476 年，当时一位名叫奥多亚塞 ( Odoacer ) 的德国将军废黜了罗穆卢斯·奥古斯都鲁斯 (Romulus Augustulus)皇帝，并确立了自己的身份是意大利国王，而不是罗马皇帝。即使(历史学家)对这个日期的指定可能是任意的，但到了五世纪末，传统的罗马权威, 也已经不再是西欧大部分地区政治权力的基础了。

Historians of Rome have debated what the fall of Rome actually means. As soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. Instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long.

罗马历史学家一直在争论, 罗马的衰落到底意味着什么。一旦时间或意外除去了人造支撑物，巨大的织物就会屈服于自身重量的压力。与其探究罗马帝国为何被毁灭，我们应惊讶于它竟然存在了这么久。

'''

==  东罗马帝国 (395-1453年)

=== 古代晚期

The Roman Empire Moves East.

罗马帝国东移。

image:/img/0013.jpg[,100%]

Constantine had effectively ushered in a new era of Christian governance. The Roman Empire’s eastward shift epitomized the major cultural changes occurring during this period. Because of these shifts, Late Antiquity has been characterized as a transitional period between the ancient and medieval worlds that occurred from roughly 150 to 750 CE. People from this period thought of themselves as being different from what was seen in the ancient world.

君士坦丁实际上开创了基督教统治的新时代。罗马帝国的东移, 集中体现了这一时期发生的重大文化变革。由于这些转变，”古代晚期”被描述为"古代世界"和"中世纪之"间的过渡时期，大约发生在公元 150 年至 750 年。这一时期的人们在某些方面认为, 自己与古代世界不同。

The period of Late Antiquity witnessed the height of two great competing empires. The Roman Empire morphed into the Byzantine Empire. Meanwhile, in the East, the Sasanian Empire emerged and vied with the Byzantines for supremacy.

古代晚期见证了两个伟大且相互竞争的帝国的鼎盛时期。罗马帝国演变成"拜占庭帝国"(即东罗马帝国). 在东方，"萨珊王朝"崛起 (存在于224-651年)，并与"拜占庭帝国"争夺霸权。

'''

===  7-8世纪 (史料严重缺乏)

This period is known as the “Byzantine Dark Age” because of the severe lack of historical writing that survived in the seventh and eighth centuries.

由于七、八世纪的历史著作严重缺乏, 导致这一时期被称为“拜占庭黑暗时代”.

'''

===  被 (突厥)奥斯曼土耳其帝国 灭亡 (1453 年)

The fall of Constantinople was lamented in Europe as signaling that no significant force remained to counter the Muslim advance westward. For many historians, it also marks the end of the European Middle Ages.

君士坦丁堡的陷落, 在欧洲引起了人们的哀叹，因为这表明没有足够的力量来对抗穆斯林向西推进。对于许多历史学家来说，这也标志着欧洲中世纪的结束。
