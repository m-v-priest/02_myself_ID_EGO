The sixteenth century was a time of exploration and the beginning of global ocean trade. When European nations such as Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, England, and France were just setting out on voyages of exploration and beginning to forge maritime trade networks, a thriving oceangoing commerce was already being carried on in the Indian Ocean.

十六世纪是探索的时代，也是全球海洋贸易的开端。当西班牙、葡萄牙、荷兰、英国、法国等欧洲国 家刚刚开始远洋探险、开始构建海上贸易网络时，印度洋上的远洋贸易已然蓬勃发展。

Example 1. 案例
"just" 强调了行动处于一个刚刚开始的阶段。 "were setting out" 表示这些国家当时正在逐步开展航海探索和建立贸易网络，强调的是这个动作当时正处于进行中。
如果没有特别想强调这个过程或阶段性，改为简单过去时 "just set out on voyages" 也完全合理。

After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, access to the known routes to spices and other Asian goods that Europeans desired lay entirely in Muslim hands. Now there was an even greater incentive to find new routes to the lands of the East. It was for this reason that, in 1492, Christopher Columbus, in the employ of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain, ventured out into the Atlantic in search of an oceanic route to India.

1453 年君士坦丁堡落入奥斯曼帝国手中后，通往欧洲人想要的香料和其他亚洲商品的已知路线完全掌 握在穆斯林手中。现在，人们更有动力去寻找通往东方土地的新路线。正是出于这个 原因，1492年，克里斯托弗·哥伦布在西班牙女王伊莎贝拉和国王斐迪南的雇佣下，冒险进入大西洋， 寻找通往印度的海洋航线。

In 1494, following Columbus’s landing in the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, ratifying Pope Alexander VI’s decision that all non-Christian lands west of a line drawn one hundred leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa, which Portugal already claimed, were to belong to Spain. Non-Christian lands east of the line were given to Portugal. Four years later, another Portuguese sailor, Vasco da Gama, became the first European to sail all the way to India after rounding the Cape of Good Hope.

1494年，哥伦布登陆加勒比海后，西班牙和葡萄牙签署了《托德西利亚斯条约》 ，批准了教皇亚历山 大六世的决定，即佛得角群岛以西一百里格线以西的所有非基督教土地均位于佛得角海岸附近。葡萄 牙已经声称拥有主权的非洲属于西班牙。分界线以东的非基督教土地划归葡萄牙。四年 后，另一位葡萄牙水手瓦斯科·达·伽马成为第一个绕过好望角，一路航行到印度的欧洲人。

The Treaty of Tordesillas. Without reference to the sovereignty of the people who lived there, the Treaty of Tordesillas granted all lands in Africa and Asia to Portugal. Spain received the Americas except the easternmost portion of South America, which eventually became the Portuguese colony of Brazil.

托德西拉斯条约。 《托德西利亚斯条约》在不考虑当地人民主权的情况 下，将非洲和亚洲的所有土地授予葡萄牙。西班牙获得了除南美洲最东部部分之 外的美洲，最终成为葡萄牙在巴西的殖民地。

In 1498, da Gama sailed north along the east coast of Africa and from there across the Indian Ocean to the southwestern coast of India, where he landed in the port of Calicut (Kozhikode) in what is today the state of Kerala. Da Gama had come to India on a quest to find an all-water route to Southeast and East Asia, the source of spices, silks, porcelains, and other Asian goods. Europeans had had access to such luxuries for centuries, but they were expensive. They had to be carried overland, which limited the amounts that could be brought to Europe, and they also passed through the hands of many intermediaries between their point of origin and their European consumers. Finding an all-water route to the source was intended to eliminate these problems, and the nation that did so stood to become very wealthy. Before the voyages of the Portuguese, trade with Asia had been monopolized by northern Italian merchants, especially the Venetians, to the envy of merchants in other countries. Da Gama hoped to change this.

1498年，达伽马沿非洲东海岸向北航行，穿过印度洋到达印度西南海岸，在卡利卡特（科泽科德）港 （即今天的喀拉拉邦）登陆 。达伽马来到印度是为了寻找一条通往东南亚和东亚的全水路 航线，那里是香料、丝绸、瓷器和其他亚洲商品的来源地。几个世纪以来，欧洲人一直能享受到这样 的奢侈品，但它们价格昂贵。它们必须通过陆路运输，这限制了可以带到欧洲的数量，而且它们还在 原产地和欧洲消费者之间经过了许多中间商之手。寻找一条通往水源的全水路的目的是为了消除这些 问题，而这样做的国家将会变得非常富有。在葡萄牙人远航之前，与亚洲的贸易一直被意大利北部商 人，尤其是威尼斯人垄断，令其他国家的商人羡慕不已。达伽马希望改变这一点。

The “India Run.” Working for Portugal, Vasco da Gama sailed north along the east coast of Africa and across the Indian Ocean to Calicut, in the southern Indian province of Kerala, establishing what became the typical sea route to India, the carreira da Índia, or “India Run.”

“印度跑”。瓦斯科·达·伽马为葡萄牙工作，沿着非洲东海岸向北航行，穿过印度洋到达印度南部喀拉拉邦的卡利卡特，建立了通往 印度的典型海上航线，即“印度航线” ”。

Da Gama’s success in reaching India led to future expeditions.

达伽马成功到达印度，为以后的探险活动奠定了基础。

Establishing a pattern that they and other Europeans later replicated throughout India, the Portuguese sought to divide and conquer by entering into alliance with some local rulers to the disadvantage of others, a strategy made easier in later decades by the weakening of the Mughal Empire.

葡萄牙人建立了一种后来在印 度各地复制的模式，他们试图通过与一些当地统治者结盟而不利于其他统治者来分而治之，这种策略 在后来的几十年中随着莫卧儿帝国的衰弱而变得更加容易。

Beginning in 1502, the Portuguese also attempted to increase their revenues by demanding that ships trading in the Indian Ocean carry a cartaz, a document bearing the Christian cross. Ships that did not carry the cartaz had their cargoes seized and were sunk. All non-Portuguese resented Portugal’s attempts to dominate Indian Ocean trade.

从 1502 年开始，葡萄牙人还试图通过要求在印度洋贸易的船只携带带有基督教十字架的文件“ cartaz” (相当于通行证)来增加收入。没有携带卡塔兹的船只的货物 被扣押并被击沉。所有非葡萄 牙人都对葡萄牙试图主导印度洋贸易表示不满。

The Portuguese took possession of additional territory in India in subsequent years.

随后几年，葡萄牙人占领了印度的更多领土.

Reports of the marvelous wealth of India and the riches amassed by Portuguese merchants encouraged the Europeans of other nations to seek their fortunes in the Indian Ocean. In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I of England granted a monopoly on trade in the Indian Ocean to the British East India Company (also known as the English East India Company or the East India Company). The British East India Company was a joint stock company in which numerous merchants pooled their money to fund trading voyages and share the profits. An expedition to India required an enormous outlay of money that few individuals could afford, and if they could, they might lose their entire fortunes if the expedition were unsuccessful. By pooling funds, none had to risk all they owned.

印度的惊人财富和葡萄牙商人积累的财富的报道鼓励其他国家的欧洲人到印度洋寻找财富。 1600年， 英国女王伊丽莎白一世将印度洋贸易垄断权授予英国东印度公司（又称英国东印度公司或东印度公 司）。 英国东印度公司是一家股份公司，众多商人汇集资金为贸易航行提供资金并分享利润。远征印 度需要巨额开支，很少有人能负担得起，即使有能力，如果远征不成功，他们也可能会倾家荡产。通 过汇集资金，任何人都不必拿自己拥有的一切去冒险。

Dutch and French merchants also formed joint stock East India companies. While the Dutch focused most of their attention on the islands of Indonesia, France competed with England and Portugal to harvest the wealth of India.

荷兰和法国商人还组建了股份制东印度公司。当荷兰人将大部分注意力集中在印度尼西亚群岛时，法 国则与英国和葡萄牙争夺印度的财富。

In their attempt to resist English expansion, the Mughals turned to the French for assistance. Already rivals in trade, beginning in 1754 France and Britain found themselves enmeshed in a war in North America for control of that continent. This conflict, called the French and Indian War, soon spread to Europe where fighting broke out in 1756. As part of this now-global conflict, called the Seven Years’ War, French and British armies and navies engaged in battle in India as well. France allied itself with the Mughal Empire.

为了抵抗英国的扩张，莫卧儿人向法国寻求援助。从 1754 年开始，法国和英国就已经是贸易对手，他 们发现自己卷入了北美大陆控制权的战争。这场被称为“法国和印度战争”的冲突很快蔓延到欧洲，并于 1756 年爆发了战斗。作为这场被称为“七年战争”的全球冲突的一部分，法国和英国的陆军和海军也在 印度交战。 。法国与莫卧儿帝国结盟。

With both the Mughals and the Marathas weakened after years of combat with one another as well as with invading Afghans and encroaching Europeans, small states in northern India broke away from their control and recognized British authority in exchange for acknowledgment of their claims to rule. The chaos that ensued helped the British in their quest to gain control of India. In this way, through a combination of alliances and military victories and the use they made of existing divisions between its kingdoms and rulers, the British gradually gained control of India.

由于莫卧儿人和马拉塔人经过多年的相互斗争以及入侵的阿富汗人和欧洲人的侵略而衰弱，印度北部 的小邦脱离了他们的控制并承认英国的权威，以换取承认他们的统治主张。随后发生的混乱帮助英国 人寻求控制印度。就这样，通过联盟和军事胜利的结合，以及利用王国和统治者之间现有的分歧，英 国逐渐控制了印度。

The political entity of Britain was formed after the union of England and Scotland following the death of Elizabeth I. The kingdom of Great Britain was officially formed in 1707. It is a bit anachronistic to refer to the British East India Company before the nation of Great Britain existed, but that is the name by which the company is most commonly known.

英国的政治实体是在伊丽莎白一世去世后英格兰和苏格兰联合后形成的。大不列颠王国于 1707 年正式成 立。在英国国家之前提及英国东印度公司有点不合时宜。英国确实存在，但这是该公司最广为人知的名 称。

Ferdinand Magellan also dreamed of finding a route to the Spice Islands. He planned, however, to discover a westward route by sailing west from Portugal, instead of taking the long route eastward around the tip of Africa and through the Indian Ocean. When the Portuguese king declined to fund the exploratory voyage, Magellan approached the king of Spain, who provided him with the funds and ships he needed. The crew came from many countries, which was common aboard ships at that time.

费迪南德·麦哲伦(葡萄牙人)也梦想找到一条通往香料群岛的航线。然 而，他计划从葡萄牙向西航行，探索一条向西的航线，而不是绕非洲一角、穿过印度洋向东走很长的 航线。当葡萄牙国王拒绝资助这次探险航行时，麦哲伦找到了西班牙国王，西班牙国王为他提供了所 需的资金和船只。

In 1519, with a fleet of five ships and a crew of two hundred seventy, Magellan departed from Spain. He crossed the Atlantic and sailed around the southern tip of South America. On March 6, 1521, with their fresh water nearly exhausted after three months spent crossing the Pacific, they sighted Guam, and not long after, they made landfall in the Philippines.

1519 年，麦哲伦率领一支由五艘船和 270 名船员组成的舰队离开西班牙。他横渡大西洋，绕过南美洲 南端. 1521年3月6日，他们在横渡太平洋三个月后淡水几乎耗尽的情况下，看到了 关岛，不久就在菲律宾登陆。

In 1571, the Spanish established the city of Manila, which became their capital in the East Indies.

1571年，西班牙人建立了马尼拉 市，成为他们在东印度群岛的首都。

In the same year as Columbus’s momentous voyage, Spain defeated the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula and expelled Jewish people from the land. Challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church were brewing, however, and the passage of less than a century found Europeans hopelessly divided over matters of faith as the result of an event known as the Protestant Reformation.

。哥伦布伟大航海的同一年，西班牙击败了伊比利亚半岛最后一个穆斯林据点，并 将犹太人驱逐出这片土地。然而，对天主教会权威的挑战正在酝酿之中，不到一个世纪的时间，欧洲人 因新教改革事件而在信仰问题上出现无可救药的分裂。

The Protestant Reformation began in 1517, but its seeds had been sown years earlier. Over the course of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church had grown richer, and its higher clerical offices had become dominated by people motivated more by the desire for wealth and power than by spiritual concerns. Although Europe’s peasants remained devoutly attached to their faith, critics claimed that popes acted less like Christ’s representatives on earth and more like secular princes, intervening in European political affairs and even commanding armies. Members of the clergy often lived lavishly in palatial surroundings and dressed themselves in silks and furs. Some had mistresses and illegitimate children, who were often given positions in the church. Wealthy families often purchased church offices for their members, and some men held bishoprics (areas under the authority of a bishop) in more than one place at a time by hiring other men to perform their offices. Secular rulers, kings, and princes jealous of the church’s power sometimes vied with the pope for control of the churches in their territory and welcomed opportunities to reject the church’s authority.

新教改革始于 1517 年，但其种子早在几年前就已播下。在中世纪的过程中，天主教会变得更加富有， 其高级教职职位已被更多出于对财富和权力的渴望而不是精神关注的人们所主导。尽管欧洲农民仍然 虔诚地信仰他们的信仰，但批评者声称，教皇的行为不太像基督在地球上的代表，而更像世俗王子， 干预欧洲政治事务，甚至指挥军队。神职人员经常生活在富丽堂皇的环境中，穿着丝绸和毛皮衣服。 有些人有情妇和私生子，他们经常在教会中担任职务。富裕的家庭经常为其成员购买教堂办公室，一 些男子通过雇用其他男子履行职责，同时在多个地方拥有主教职位（主教管辖的地区）。嫉妒教会权 力的世俗统治者、国王和王子有时会与教皇争夺对其领土内教会的控制权，并欢迎拒绝教会权威的机 会。

During the fifteenth century, in the city-states of northern Italy, an intellectual movement called humanism had taken hold. Humanism stressed the value and dignity of human beings.

十五世纪，在意大利北部的城邦中，一场名为人文主义的知识运动盛行。人文主义强调人的价值和尊 严

A German monk named Martin Luther began the Protestant Reformation. Luther was outraged at the selling of indulgences. Indulgences were a way to reduce or even cancel the time after death during which people needed to suffer in purgatory to atone for their sins before reaching heaven. These rewards could be earned by performing actions of great religious merit, such as going on Crusade. However, the church also taught that the pope controlled a store of merit amassed by Jesus and the Christian saints, whose virtue was so great they had entered heaven with grace left over. The church could allot this “extra” virtue to someone else in the form of an indulgence.

一位名叫马丁·路德的德国僧侣开启了新教改革。路德对出售赎罪券感到愤怒。赎罪券是一种减少甚至取消死后时间的方法，在这段 时间里，人们在进入天堂之前需要在炼狱中受苦以赎罪。这些奖励可以通过执行具有重大宗教价值的 行为来获得，例如参加十字军东征。然而，教会还教导说，教皇控制着耶稣和基督教圣徒积累的功 德，他们的美德如此之大，以至于他们带着剩余的恩典进入了天堂。教会可以以赎罪券的形式将这种 “额外”的美德分配给其他人。

He drafted ninety-five arguments explaining why the sale of indulgences was wrong.

他起草了九十五条论据来解释为什么 出售赎罪券是错误的

Martin Luther argued that the sale of indulgences was wrong. He believed only God could grant forgiveness and that humans could do nothing to ensure their salvation, which depended entirely upon God. This is known as the doctrine of justification by faith. Luther also said the pope had no control over purgatory and that there was no foundation in the Bible for the belief that the merit amassed by Jesus and the saints could be given to others. His intent in the Ninety-five Theses was to spark a discussion within the church that would lead to reform. Following are several of the theses.

马丁·路德认为出售赎罪券是错误的。他相信只有上帝才能给予宽恕，人类无法采取任何措施 来确保他们的救赎，这完全取决于上帝。这被称为因信称义的教义。路德还表示，教皇无法 控制炼狱，圣经中没有任何基础可以相信耶稣和圣徒所积累的功德可以给予他人。他提出九 十五条论纲的目的是在教会内部引发一场讨论，从而导致改革。以下是其中几篇论文。

Any truly repentant Christian has a right to full remission of penalty and guilt, even without indulgence letters.

任何真正悔改的基督徒都有权完全免除刑罚和罪责，即使没有赦罪信。

Christians are to be taught that he who gives to the poor or lends to the needy does a better deed than he who buys indulgences.

基督徒应该被教导，施舍给穷人或借钱给有需要的人比购买赎罪券的人做得更好。

Christians are to be taught that the pope would and should wish to give of his own money, even though he had to sell the basilica of St. Peter, to many of those from whom certain hawkers of indulgences cajole money.

基督徒应该被教导，教皇愿意而且应该愿意将自己的钱捐给许多那些被某些赎罪券 小贩骗取金钱的人，即使他不得不卖掉圣彼得大教堂。

In 1521, he was excommunicated (excluded from participating in the life of the church).

1521年，他(路德)被逐出教会（被排除 在教会生活之外）。

The version of Christianity that developed from Luther’s ideas, and that formed the basis for what became the Protestant faith, differed from the official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church in important ways. The Catholic Church taught that salvation was achieved through a combination of religious faith and good works. Buying an indulgence was regarded as a good work because the money went to the church. Luther taught that faith alone was sufficient for salvation and that humans were unable to work toward their own redemption, which depended entirely upon God. Furthermore, adherence to centuries’ worth of Catholic tradition was not necessary to be a good Christian. Luther contended that scripture alone should be the source of Christian belief and practice. His followers thus abandoned many traditional Catholic practices, including clerical celibacy.

Protestants also called for the abolition of religious orders of monks and nuns. A life in the clergy, which the Catholic Church had proclaimed the greatest of all callings, was considered no better than the pursuit of any other vocation in life. The printing press with movable type, developed in Europe during the Renaissance, aided Martin Luther in his efforts to spread his message.

从路德的思想发展而来的基督教版本，构成了新教信仰的基础，在许多重要方面不同于罗马天主教会 的官方教义。天主教会教导说，救赎是通过宗教信仰和善行的结合来实现的。购买赎罪券被认为是一 件好事，因为钱都捐给了教堂。路德教导说，只有信仰就足以获得救赎，而人类无法为自己的救赎而 努力，这完全取决于上帝（图5.4 ）。此外，遵守几个世纪的天主教传统并不是成为一名优秀基督徒的 必要条件。路德认为，圣经本身应该是基督教信仰和实践的源泉。因此，他的追随者放弃了许多传统 的天主教习俗，包括神职人员独身。新教徒 还呼吁废除僧侣和修女的宗教秩序。天主教会宣称神职人员是所有职业中最伟大的，但人们认为神职 人员的生活并不比追求生活中任何其他职业更好。文艺复兴时期在欧洲发展起来的活字印刷机帮助马 丁·路德传播了他的信息.

Efforts to silence Martin Luther were unsuccessful, and the new form of Christianity called Protestantism spread throughout the German-speaking lands. Often the new religion was welcomed by rulers as a reason to reject the pope’s authority.

压制马丁·路德的努力没有成功，新教的基督教形式在整个德语区传播开来。通常，新宗教受到统治者的欢迎，作为拒绝教皇权威的理由

Another center of Protestant thought was the city of Geneva in what is now Switzerland. The city’s religious leader, John Calvin, espoused a doctrine known as predestination, which held that God had predetermined which souls would be granted salvation upon death and which were destined for hell. No person could ever know for certain whether they were saved or damned, and there was nothing they could do to ensure salvation. Calvinists embraced the doctrine, despite denying human agency.

新教思想的另一个中心是日内瓦市，位于现在的瑞士。该市的宗教领袖约翰·加尔文(John Calvin ) 他的思想与马丁·路德的思想相似，但在一个关键方面有所不同。加尔文拥护一种被称为预定论 的学说，该学说认为上帝已经预先确定了哪些灵魂将在死亡后获得救赎，哪些灵魂注定要下地狱。没 有人能够确切地知道自己是得救了还是被诅咒了，而且他们也无法采取任何措施来确保得救(命定论)。它否认人类的能动性，

The English Reformation, however, was of a different character. In England, reform was initially imposed from the top down, not by a committed convert but by a king looking for an expedient way to exchange one queen for another.

然而，英 国宗教改革却具有不同的特征。在英格兰，改革最初是自上而下实施的，不是由坚定的皈依者实施 的，而是由国王寻求一种权宜之计，将一位女王换成另一位女王。

Henry VIII of England decided to remove himself from under the pope’s authority. Henry declared the English church no longer bound by the pope’s authority. In 1534, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, establishing the Church of England with the English monarch as its head.

英国的亨利八世决定摆脱教皇的权威。亨利宣布英国教会不再受教皇权威的约束。 1534年，议会通过了《至 高无上法案》 ，建立了以英国君主为首脑的英国国教。

Under Henry’s leadership, the Church of England (also known as the Anglican Church) remained largely Catholic in terms of both doctrine and ritual, but his failure to purge the English Church of all elements of Roman Catholicism did not sit well with many Protestants.

在亨利的领导下，英国国教（也称为英国圣公会）在教义和仪式上基本上仍然是天主教徒。但他未能清除英国教会中罗马天主教的所有元素，这让许多新教徒感到不满。

The Catholic Reformation, also called the Counter-Reformation, was the Catholic Church’s effort to address Luther’s challenges as well as to effect other necessary reforms. Indulgences were retained, but their sale was forbidden. The council prohibited church officials from appointing relatives to church offices, limited bishops to holding office in only one bishopric, and took steps to improve the education of Catholic clergy and curb their luxurious habits.

天主教宗 教改革，也称为反宗教改革，是天主教会为解决路德的挑战以及实施其他必要的改革而做出的努力。赎罪券被保留，但禁止出售。该 委员会禁止教会官员任命亲属担任教会职务，限制主教只能在一个主教区担任职务，并采取措施改善 天主教神职人员的教育并遏制他们的奢侈习惯。

The transition from Catholicism to Protestantism in England was more peaceful than elsewhere.

在英国，从天主教到新教的过渡比其他地方更加和平。

Parliament’s 1558 Act of Supremacy once again declared the Church of England separate from the Roman Catholic Church.

1558年议会的至高无上法案再次宣布英格兰教会与罗马天主教会分离。

During Elizabeth’s reign, English Calvinists, known as Puritans, attempted unsuccessfully to move the Church of England even further from the doctrine and ritual of the Catholic Church.

By the 1570s and 1580s, Puritans had also come to oppose the structure of the Church of England, in which the monarch was the head of the church. They believed churches should be independent and governed by groups of elected elders instead of a king or queen. Elizabeth was unwilling to change the manner in which the Church of England was governed, however. During the reign of her successor James I, Puritans who wished to separate from the Church of England (known as Separatists) began to depart England for places, including mainland Europe and North America, where they believed they would be able to establish ideal Christian communities.

在伊丽莎白统治期间，被称为清教徒的英国加尔文主义者试图使英国国教进一步远离天主教会的教义 和仪式，但没有成功。到了1570年代和1580年代，清教徒也开始反对英国国教的结构，即君主是教 会的领袖。他们认为教会应该独立，并由选举产生的长老团体而不是国王或王后管理。然而，伊丽莎 白不愿意改变英国国教的治理方式。在她的继任者詹姆斯一世统治期间，希望脱离英国国教的清教徒 （称为分离主义者）开始离开英国前往欧洲大陆和北美等地，他们相信在那里能够建立理想的基督教 社区。

Outside England, the dispute over whether a kingdom should be Catholic or Protestant could be quite violent.

在英格兰以外，关于一个王国应该信奉天主教还是新教的争论可能会相当激烈。

France officially issued the Edict of Nantes in 1598. The edict established Catholicism as the official religion of France.

法国于1598年颁布南特敕令, 令确立天主教为法国国教

In the Spanish Netherlands, Philip II of Spain fought against Calvinist rebels. The seven northern provinces established their independence from Spain as the United Provinces of the Netherlands. The Netherlands was not the only place in which Philip II, who regarded himself and Spain as defenders of Catholicism, fought to maintain the church’s supremacy. In 1588, he launched a naval attack on England with the intent of restoring it to the Catholic Church and ending its support for Protestant rebels in the Spanish Netherlands. The invasion failed.

西班牙的菲利普二世与加尔文主义叛乱分子作战。但北部七个省份脱离西班牙独立，成为荷兰联合省。荷兰并不是唯一一个为维护教会至高无上地位而奋斗的地方。1588年，他对英格兰发动海上进攻，目的是恢复天主教会的统治，并结束其对西属尼德兰新教叛乱分 子的支持。入侵失败了。

The wars of religion continued into the seventeenth century. From 1618 to 1648, the Thirty Years’ War between Catholic and Protestant states raged in the Holy Roman Empire. As German Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists fought one another, other European countries entered the fray.

宗教战争一直持续到十七世纪。 1618年至1648年，神圣罗马帝国天主教国家与新教国家之间的三十年 战争爆发。当德国天主教徒、路德教徒和加尔文教徒互相争斗时，其他欧洲国家也加入了战斗。

In the end, the German Protestants were victorious. The Peace of Westphalia, which ended the war in 1648, established the independence of each of the entities, numbering nearly one thousand, that had made up the Holy Roman Empire. 最终，德国新教徒取得胜利. 1648 年结束战争的《威斯特伐利亚和约》确 立了组成神圣罗马帝国的近千个实体的独立性。

With the collapse of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in 1453, many Europeans felt a sense of doom. Not only had they lost a bastion of Christian power, but Muslims now controlled their tenuous overland connections to South and East Asia. As a result, they now had to go through Muslim intermediaries to purchase valuable spices such as cinnamon, pepper, cloves, and nutmeg that grew in only a few key locations. European nations, therefore, wanted to find an all-water passage to India and the chain of sparsely populated Indonesian islands known as the Spice Islands.

，随着 1453 年君士坦丁堡的崩溃和拜占庭帝国落入奥斯曼帝国手中，许多欧洲人感到了一种 末日感。他们不仅失去了基督教权力的堡垒，而且穆斯林现在还控制了他们与南亚和东亚的脆弱的陆 路联系。结果，他们现在必须通过穆斯林中介购买肉桂、胡椒、丁香和肉豆蔻等珍贵香料，而这些香 料只生长在少数几个关键地点。因此，欧洲国家希望找到一条通往印度和人口稀少的印度尼西亚群岛 （即香料群岛）的全水路通道。

In the first millennium CE, Arab sailors in the Middle East had created the lateen sail, a triangular sail that allowed ships to travel against the wind. The square European sail gave ships power, but the lateen sail increased their ability to maneuver. When Europeans combined the two kinds of sail on three-masted ships, they could navigate confidently in any direction. The sternpost rudder, created in China in the thirteenth century, also allowed for steering against the currents. For directional guidance, the ancient Greek astrolabe, which used constellations as a guide and enabled mariners to find their north–south position on the earth’s surface, came to Europe after being refined in the Middle East. The magnetic compass also came to Europe in the fifteenth century, making its way from China where it was guiding ships by 1100 CE. The adoption of these inventions allowed Europeans to abandon their long-standing practice of navigating by sailing along a coastline. Now they could venture into the open ocean, beyond sight of land.

公元第一个千年，中 东的阿拉伯水手发明了三角帆，一种可以让船只逆风航行的三角帆。欧洲方帆给船只提供了动力，而 三角帆则增加了船只的机动能力。当欧洲人将这两种风帆结合在三桅船上时，他们可以自信地向任何 方向航行。十三世纪在中国发明的尾柱舵也可以逆流转向。为了引导方向，古希腊的星盘在中东经过 完善后传入了欧洲，它以星座为向导，使航海者能够确定自己在地球表面的南北位置。磁罗 盘也在 15 世纪从中国传入欧洲，并于公元 1100 年为船只导航。这些发明的采用使欧洲人放弃了长期 以来沿海岸线航行的做法。现在他们可以冒险进入看不见陆地的公海。

However, technological advancements and a desire for expanded trade and territory could take explorers only so far without financial backing. The commercial empire that funded European overseas exploration began in the Italian city-states of the Middle Ages, but the investment system on which it was based did not originate there. This system, called commenda, established a sort of financial patronage by which investors funded merchants to expand their trading enterprises and earned a more extensive business network in the process. Like many of the technologies that drove European ships, the commenda was first developed by Muslim merchants.

然而，如果没有财政支持，技术进步以及扩大贸易和领土的愿望只能让探险者走这么远。资助欧洲海 外探险的商业帝国始于中世纪的意大利城邦，但其所依赖的投资体系却并非起源于那里。这个称为 commenda的系统建立了一种金融赞助，投资者通过这种方式资助商人扩大他们的贸易企业，并在此 过程中赢得了更广泛的商业网络。与许多驱动欧洲船舶的技术一样，卡姆达最初是由穆斯林商人开发 的。 By the late fifteenth century, Italian city-states were supporting a variety of small family-owned businesses and large companies. Capital was concentrated in land and commerce rather than in industrial pursuits, but credit was widely used. Across Europe, risk-sharing business ventures and joint investment schemes were already commonplace among merchants.

到十五世纪末，意大利城邦开始支持各种小型家族企业和大公司。资本集中在土地和商业而不是工业 领域，但信贷被广泛使用。在整个欧洲，风险分担商业企业和联合投资计划在商人中已经很常见。

Portuguese Exploration

葡萄牙探索

In the late 1400s, both Portugal and Spain were emerging from centuries of rule by North African Muslim states. Portugal had become an independent country by the twelfth century. At the beginning of the fifteenth century, it was a small country with poor soil. However, it did have one advantage—a geographical location that lent itself to exploration, specifically down the African coastline and across the Atlantic. Portugal also had plenty of coves and natural harbors suited for shipping, and speedy crosswinds and currents that gave it a shipping superhighway of sorts between northern and southern Europe. Various nearby islands such as the Azores also teemed with untapped fishing potential.

1400 年代末，葡萄牙和西班牙都摆脱了北非穆斯林国家几个世纪的统治。葡萄牙到12世纪已成为独立 国家。十五世纪初，它还是一个土地贫瘠的小国。然而，它确实有一个优势——适合探索的 地理位置，特别是沿着非洲海岸线和横跨大西洋。葡萄牙还拥有大量适合航运的海湾和天然港口，以 及快速的侧风和洋流，使其成为北欧和南欧之间的航运高速公路。亚速尔群岛等附近的各个岛屿也充 满了未开发的渔业潜力。

In the 1340s, King Afonso IV of Portugal raised public funds to build a commercial fleet that by the fifteenth century had transformed the nation into a maritime power. In 1341, the Portuguese sailed to the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. This was only the beginning of their exploration and conquest. In 1415, John I, grandson of Afonso IV, dispatched Portuguese forces to capture the city of Ceuta in Morocco. John hoped that control of a port on the North African coast would open that continent to both conquest and trade. To further cement his control of the region, he requested papal recognition of his efforts. In April 1418, Pope Martin V granted the Portuguese king the right to all African lands taken from Muslim rulers.

1340 年代，葡萄牙国王阿方索四世筹集公共资金建造了一支商业船队，到 15 世纪，该船队已将该国 转变为海上强国。 1341年，葡萄牙人航行到大西洋的加那利群岛。这只是他们探索和征服的开始。 1415年，阿方索四世的孙子约翰一世派遣葡萄牙军队攻占摩洛哥的休达城。约翰希望控制北非海岸的 一个港口将使该大陆向征服和贸易开放。为了进一步巩固他对该地区的控制，他请求教皇承认他的努 力。 1418 年 4 月，教皇马丁五世授予葡萄牙国王从穆斯林统治者手中夺取的所有非洲土地的权利。

Portuguese explorers claimed the Madeira Islands, the Azores, and the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa. Eventually, Portuguese expeditions reached the southern tip of Africa, and in 1488, Bartolomeu Dias sailed around the Cape of Good Hope to reach the eastern side of the continent.

葡萄牙探险家声称拥有非洲海岸附近的 马德拉群岛、亚速尔群岛和佛得角群岛。最 终，葡萄牙探险队到达了非洲南端，1488年，的巴尔托洛梅乌·迪亚士绕过好望角，到 达了非洲大陆的东侧。

The Portuguese were driven by both religious fervor and a desire for wealth.

葡萄牙人受到宗教热情和对财富的渴望的驱动。

The Portuguese also hoped to gain access to the wealth of Africa. As they moved southward along the continent’s coast, they established citadels on land leased from local rulers, like the fortress of Elmina, located on the coast of present-day Ghana. From there, they bartered for gold, ivory, and enslaved people.

Kongo became an important source of enslaved laborers, and its kings readily assisted the Portuguese in taking captives from enemy tribes. The Portuguese claim to the riches of African trade was affirmed in 1455 in the Romanus Pontifex, a papal decree issued by Pope Nicholas V that granted Portugal exclusive rights to trade in Africa south of Cape Bojador, on the coast of Morocco.

葡萄牙人还希望获得非洲的财富。当他们沿着非洲大陆海岸向南移动时，他们在从当地统治者租借的 土地上建立了城堡，例如位于当今加纳海岸的埃尔米纳堡垒。从那里，他们交换黄金、象牙和奴隶。 刚果成为奴隶劳工的重要来源，其国王很乐意协助葡萄牙人从敌对部 落中俘虏。 1455 年，教皇尼古拉斯五世颁布的教皇法令《Romanus Pontifex 》确认了葡萄牙对非洲 贸易财富的主张，该法令授予葡萄牙在摩洛哥海岸博哈多尔角以南的非洲进行贸易的专有权。

Spanish Exploration

西班牙探索

By 1492, the final Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula had been defeated, and, no longer worried about the threat posed by the Muslim presence, Isabella and Ferdinand could turn to matters beyond the peninsula. In 1486, the Genoese navigator Christopher Columbus approached them with a request for funds for exploration. Columbus proposed that he could reach Asia by sailing westward across the Atlantic Ocean. Eager to find an all-water route to Asia to compete with the Portuguese, Isabella and Ferdinand agreed to his request.

到了 1492 年，穆斯林在伊比利亚半岛的最后一个据点已被击败， 伊莎贝拉和费迪南德不再担心穆斯林的存在所构成的威胁，可以将目光转向半岛以外的事务。 1486 年，热那亚航海家克里斯托弗·哥伦布向他们寻求勘探资金。哥伦布提出向西横渡大西洋可以到达亚 洲。伊莎贝拉和费迪南德渴望找到一条通往亚洲的全水路航线与葡萄牙人竞争，因此同意了他的请 求。

This was the beginning of European colonialism in the Americas. Colonialism is a practice in which one group of people attempts to establish control over another, usually for purposes of economic exploitation.

这是欧洲在美洲殖民主义的开始。殖民 主义是一种做法，其中一群人试图建立对另一群人的控制，通常是为了经济剥削的目的。

Spain’s exploration of the new continents continued, led by conquistadors. Some of these explorers were nobles or had military training and had fought against the Muslims in Spain; others were landless and wished to improve their lot in life. One instrument by which the Spanish government compensated conquistadors was the encomienda, a hereditary grant that entitled the holder, called an encomendero, to the labor of a specified number of conquered people, or to a tribute of precious metals or agricultural produce.

西班牙在征服者的带领下继续探索新 大陆。这些探险家中有些是贵族，有些受过军事训练，曾在西班牙与穆斯林作战；有些则曾受过军事 训练。其他人则没有土地，希望改善生活。西班牙政府补偿征服者的一种工具是encomienda ，这是 一种世袭赠款，赋予持有人（称为encomendero ）特定数量的被征服者的劳动权，或者获得贵重金属 或农产品的贡品。

The great prizes the Spanish hoped to find were soon discovered in Mexico. In 1519, the conquistador Hernán Cortés landed at Potonchan on the Yucatán Peninsula and marched north to the interior of Mexico, where he encountered the powerful Aztec Empire.

西班牙人希望找到的巨大战利品很快就在墨西哥被发现了。 1519年，征服者埃尔南·科尔特斯在尤卡坦 半岛的波通昌登陆，向北进军墨西哥内陆，在那里遇到了强大的阿兹特克帝国。

Cortés’s exploits in Mexico were soon matched by those of another Spanish adventurer, Francisco Pizarro, who conquered the Inca Empire in South America.

科尔特斯在墨西哥的功绩很快与另一位西班牙冒险家弗朗西斯科·皮萨罗的功绩相媲美，后者征服了南 美洲的印加帝国。

Peru, which like Mexico had extensive silver deposits, was reduced to a Spanish colony.

与墨西哥一样拥有大量银矿的秘鲁沦为西班牙殖民地。

Word of Columbus’s discoveries on behalf of the Spanish alarmed and angered the Portuguese. Under the terms of the 1479 Treaty of Alcáçovas, Portugal had renounced any claim to the Spanish throne and granted Spain control of the Canary Islands. In exchange, Portugal received the coast of Guinea in Africa, which was rich in gold, and all islands in the Atlantic south of the Canaries. This included not only those territories Portugal already controlled (Madeira, the Azores, and Cape Verde) but also any that might be discovered in the future. In 1481, the pope also issued a decree that granted Portugal territories in the Atlantic.

哥伦布代表西班牙人进行发现的消息震惊并激怒了葡萄牙人。根据 1479 年《阿尔卡索瓦斯条约》的条 款，葡萄牙放弃了对西班牙王位的任何要求，并授予西班牙对加那利群岛的控制权。作为交换，葡萄 牙获得了盛产黄金的非洲几内亚海岸以及加那利群岛以南的所有大西洋岛屿。这不仅包括葡萄牙已经 控制的领土（马德拉、亚速尔群岛和佛得角），还包括未来可能发现的任何领土。 1481年，教皇还颁 布法令，授予葡萄牙在大西洋的领土。

Spain’s claim to the Caribbean islands Columbus had explored thus seemed to violate both the treaty and the pope’s decree. Unable to challenge Portugal’s dominance at sea, Isabella and Ferdinand asked Pope Alexander VI to intercede. The pope, who was Spanish, decreed that all lands belonged to Spain that fell west of a line drawn one hundred leagues west of any of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands.

因此，西班牙对哥伦布探索的加勒比岛屿的主权主张似乎违反了该条约和教皇的法令。由于无法挑战葡萄牙的海上统治地位，伊莎贝拉和费迪南德 请求教皇亚历山大六世求情。西班牙教皇颁布法令，所有位于亚速尔群岛和佛得角群岛以西一百里格 线以西的土地都属于西班牙。

Portugal accordingly began negotiations with Spain, which consented to move the line dividing Spanish from Portuguese possessions farther to the west. The new line cut across the eastern bulge of the South American continent (now part of Brazil) but left the rest of the Americas to Spain. This agreement, the Treaty of Tordesillas, was signed in 1494 and endorsed in 1506 by a decree of Pope Julius II. Thus, when the explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on the eastern coast of South America in 1500, he was able to claim it for Portugal.

葡萄牙因此开始与西班牙谈判，西班牙同意将西班牙与葡萄牙领地的分界线移至更西的地方。新线穿 过南美大陆的东部隆起部（现在是巴西的一部分），但将美洲的其余部分留给了西班牙。该协议即 《托德西拉斯条约》于 1494 年签署，并于 1506 年由教皇尤利乌斯二世颁布法令认可。因 此，当探险家佩德罗·阿尔瓦雷斯·卡布拉尔(Pedro Álvares Cabral) 于 1500 年登陆南美洲东海岸时，他 就能够为葡萄牙占领此地。

Treaty of Tordesillas. This Spanish map from 1622 shows in red the vertical dividing line described in the Treaty of Tordesillas. It cuts north to south through the Atlantic Ocean and across the eastern portion of Brazil. All land to the right of the line was deemed to belong to Portugal, and all land to the left to Spain.

托德西拉斯条约。这幅 1622 年的西班牙地图以红色显示了《托德西拉斯条 约》中规定的垂直分界线。它从北向南穿过大西洋并穿过巴西东部。线右侧的所 有土地均被视为属于葡萄牙，线左侧的所有土地均属于西班牙。

By the time Cabral made landfall in Brazil in 1500, Portuguese sailors had already rounded the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of southern Africa and sailed up that continent’s eastern coast and on to India. Hoping to lay claim to the riches of Asia, Spain then argued that the line dividing the Atlantic continued to the other side of the globe, bisecting the Pacific and giving the Spanish the right to territories in Asia as well. Portugal objected and turned to the Vatican again for help. In 1514, Pope Leo X declared that the line described in the Treaty of Tordesillas allocated territories in the Atlantic but not the Pacific. Spain had no claim to the lands of Asia.

当卡布拉尔于 1500 年在巴西登陆时，葡萄牙水手已经绕过南部非洲一角的好望角，沿着该大陆的东海 岸航行到印度。为了获得亚洲的财富，西班牙随后辩称，大西洋的分界线一直延伸到地球的另一边， 将太平洋一分为二，西班牙也有权获得亚洲的领土。葡萄牙表示反对，并再次向梵蒂冈求助。 1514 年，教皇利奥十世宣布《托德西拉斯条约》中描述的分界线分配的是大西洋而非太平洋的领土。西班 牙对亚洲土地没有任何主权要求。

Spain renewed its argument in 1522 when an expeditionary fleet that had been captained by Ferdinand Magellan returned to Europe after circumnavigating the globe. Magellan had been in the employ of Spain when he found a means of reaching Asia by sailing around the southern tip of South America. The expedition had reached the Maluku Islands (or the Moluccas, in modern Indonesia), the source of valuable spices, and Spain wished to claim this territory, which Portugal had already explored in 1512. To settle their claims to the islands, in 1529 Portugal and Spain signed the Treaty of Zaragoza, dividing the Pacific Ocean between them. The treaty awarded the Maluku Islands to Portugal with the understanding that should Spain wish to claim them it could, but it would have to compensate Portugal for its loss. Spain did not have the money to do so, and this fact, along with a convenient marriage of the Spanish and Portuguese kings to one another’s sisters, led Spain to abandon its claim to the Malukus.

1522年，当斐迪南·麦哲伦率领的一支远征舰队绕地球一周返回欧洲时，西班牙再次提出了自己的论 点。当麦哲伦找到绕南美洲南端航行到达亚洲的方法时，他曾受雇于西班牙。探险队已到达马鲁古群 岛（或现代印度尼西亚的摩鹿加群岛），这里是珍贵香料的产地，西班牙希望对这片领土拥有主权， 而葡萄牙已于 1512 年对该地区进行了探索。为了解决对这些岛屿的主权要求，葡萄牙于 1529 年与西 班牙签订《萨拉戈萨条约》 ，瓜分了太平洋。该条约将马鲁古群岛授予葡萄牙，但有一项谅解，如果 西班牙希望声称拥有这些群岛的主权，但必须赔偿葡萄牙的损失。西班牙没有钱这样做，这一事实， 加上西班牙和葡萄牙国王与彼此的姐妹的便利联姻，导致西班牙放弃了对马鲁古群岛的主权要求。

In the treaties of Zaragoza and Tordesillas, two of the world’s nations divided the globe between them, never questioning their right to do so and turning repeatedly to the pope to give God’s sanction to their claims. Unsurprisingly, however, the world’s other nations ignored both treaties. England and the Netherlands, which had become Protestant nations during the Reformation, felt no need to abide by papal decrees, nor did France, though it remained Roman Catholic. As the French king Francis I explained, “The sun shines for me as it does for others.” As the fortunes of Spain and Portugal declined in the seventeenth century, England, France, and the Netherlands claimed territory in Asia and the Americas and established their own trading posts on the African coast. Spain and Portugal also failed to acknowledge the rights of the Indigenous peoples in the lands they claimed. Indeed, many Europeans believed that by conquering the inhabitants of the Americas and giving them no choice but to convert to Christianity, they were saving their souls.

在萨拉戈萨和托德西拉斯条约中，世界上的两个国家瓜分了地球，从不质疑自己这样做的权利，并一 再请求教皇批准他们的主张。然而，毫不奇怪的是，世界上其他国家都无视这两项条约。在宗教改革 期间成为新教国家的英格兰和荷兰觉得没有必要遵守教皇的法令，法国也没有必要遵守，尽管它仍然 是罗马天主教。正如法国国王弗朗西斯一世所解释的那样：“阳光照耀着我，也照耀着他人。”十七世 纪，随着西班牙和葡萄牙的衰落，英国、法国和荷兰声称在亚洲和美洲拥有领土，并在非洲海岸建立 了自己的贸易站。西班牙和葡萄牙也没有承认原住民在他们声称拥有的土地上的权利。事实上，许多 欧洲人相信，通过征服美洲居民并让他们别无选择，只能皈依基督教，他们就可以拯救自己的灵魂。

For many Indigenous peoples, their religious belief systems were animistic, meaning the spiritual world resided not just in humans but also in animals, plants, and even rocks. This belief was very different from monotheism, in which all spiritual power resided in one single divine being.

对于许多原住民来说，许多宗教信 仰体系都是万物有灵论的，这意味着精神世界不仅存在于人类之中，还存在于动物、植物甚至岩石 中。这种信仰与一神论非常不同，一神论中所有的精神力量都存在于一个神圣的存在中。

Like humans, animals, and plants, the earth possessed sacred power; therefore, it could not be owned. The concept of owning land seemed nonsensical to many Indigenous groups, and their corresponding lack of emphasis on private property was one reason Europeans sometimes found it easy to lay claim to lands inhabited by native peoples.

和人类、动物、植物一样，大地也拥有神圣的力量。因此，它不能被拥有。对于许多原住民群体来 说，拥有土地的概念似乎毫无意义，而他们相应地缺乏对私有财产的重视，这是欧洲人有时发现很容 易对原住民居住的土地提出要求的原因之一。

When Columbus arrived, the Indigenous population of the entire Western Hemisphere likely numbered around seventy-five million (compared to Europe’s population of probably around seventy million), although historians’ estimates vary greatly.

当哥伦布到达时，整个西半球的土著人口数量可能约为七千五百万（而欧洲的人口可能约为七千 万），尽管历史学家的估计差异很大。

Coffee and sugar cane, introduced to the Americas by Europeans, grew exceedingly well in the tropical climates of the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and the southernmost portions of North America. This need for labor eventually led to the plantation-style slavery that took hold in parts of the United States, islands in the Caribbean, and areas of South America such as Brazil.

咖啡和甘蔗由欧洲人引入美洲，在加勒比海、中美洲、南美洲和北美洲最南端的热带气候中生长得非 常好。这种对 劳动力的需求最终导致了种植园式奴隶制的出现，这种奴隶制在美国部分地区、加勒比海岛屿以及巴 西等南美洲地区盛行。
