The American Revolution

美国革命

As colonial societies warmed to the idea that political power should be based on the consent of the people, a growing dissatisfaction with the British Crown’s arbitrary rules and taxes propelled the colonies in North America toward revolution. Britain’s Proclamation Line of 1763 declared the Appalachian Mountains the western settlement boundary for the thirteen North American colonies. Its goals were to prevent further conflict with the French and Native Americans there, and to avoid the costs of defending the frontier when Britain was already struggling with debt from the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763). The colonists, some of whom had already received land grants west of the Appalachians, viewed the edict as equivalent to tyranny and disregarded it.

随着殖民地社会逐渐接受政治权力应以人民同意为基础的观念，对英国王室专制统治和税收的日益不 满促使北美殖民地走向革命。英国1763年公告宣布阿巴拉契亚山脉为北美十三个殖民地的西部定居点 边界。它的目标是防止与当地的法国人和美洲原住民发生进一步的冲突，并避免在英国已 经在七年战争（1756-1763）的债务中挣扎时避免保卫边境的费用。殖民者（其中一些人已经获得了阿 巴拉契亚山脉以西的土地）认为该法令等同于暴政，因而无视它。

1763 年公告线。该地图描绘了 1763 年英国为其北美殖民地向西定居所划 定的边界，以节省成本并避免与美洲原住民和法国人发生冲突。殖民者将其视为 国王暴政的又一实例。

Tensions were further heightened by the imposition of taxes and commercial regulations. In particular, the Stamp Act of 1765 taxed legal documents and printed materials as a means of generating revenue for Britain, which led to widespread protests. North American colonists had paid taxes imposed by Parliament before, but the intent of those taxes had been to repay debts held by the government. Although this was also the original purpose of the Stamp Act, to pay debts accrued during the Seven Years’ War, the tax remained in place after the debt had been paid. This was the first time the colonists were expected to pay a tax intended solely to generate an ongoing source of revenue for the British government. Furthermore, colonists were unable to vote for members of Parliament and thus had no representatives to consent to this taxation on their behalf.

税收和商业法规的征收进一步加剧了紧张局势。特别是1765年的《印花税法》对法律文件和印刷材料 征税，作为英国创收的手段，引发了广泛的抗议。北美殖民者以前曾缴纳议会征收的税款，但这些税 款的目的是偿还政府持有的债务。尽管这也是《印花税法》的最初目的，为了偿还七年战争期间累积 的债务，但在债务偿还后，税收仍然存在。这是殖民者第一次缴纳旨在为英国政府创造持续收入来源 的税收。此外，殖民者无法投票选出议会成员，因此没有代表代表他们同意这项征税。

The Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 but merely replaced it with a variety of other taxes and duties that led to general turmoil in the colonies, especially in Boston. Indeed, in the same year the Stamp Act was repealed, Parliament passed the Declaratory Act, which stated that it had absolute authority to impose taxes on the colonies and to regulate their affairs. After Parliament took the extreme step of dispatching soldiers to Massachusetts to restore order and threatened customary liberties in the process, support in the colonies for a complete break with Britain intensified.

1766 年，议会废除了《印花税法》，只是用各种其他税收和关税取而代之，这导致了殖民地，尤其是 波士顿的普遍动乱。事实上，在《印花税法》被废除的同一年，议会通过了《宣言法》 ，该法规定议 会拥有向殖民地征税和管理其事务的绝对权力。在议会采取极端措施，派遣士兵前往马萨诸塞州恢复 秩序，并在此过程中威胁传统自由后，殖民地对与英国彻底决裂的支持加强了。

Parliament then granted the British East India Company a monopoly on the importation of tea, which angered colonial tea merchants and led to armed conflict, initiating the American Revolution in 1775. As the crisis escalated, revolutionary sentiment came to a head when the first and second Continental Congresses, assemblies of elected colonial representatives, met in Philadelphia in 1774 and 1775, respectively. The Second Continental Congress adopted the powers of government as a form of resistance to British tyranny and in 1776 approved the Declaration of Independence.

议会随后授予英国东印度公司茶叶进口垄断权，此举激怒了殖民地茶商，引发了武装冲突，引发了 1775年的美国革命。大陆会议，即选举产生的殖民地代表的集会，分别于 1774 年和 1775 年在费城举 行。第二次大陆会议通过了政府权力作为反抗英国暴政的一种形式，并于 1776 年批准了《独立宣言》 。

The Declaration of Independence was modeled on Enlightenment principles of sovereignty and natural rights, particularly the social contract theory of the writer and philosopher John Locke. Although support for independence was not universal among the colonists, and a substantial minority remained neutral or actively supported the British, twelve of the thirteen colonies ultimately approved the Declaration of Independence, the only abstention being New York. In the military conflict that ensued, Britain initially won most of the battles, but the Continental Army led by General George Washington eventually prevailed, and the British surrendered at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. Some fighting continued until the fall of 1783, but peace was formally declared when representatives of the new United States and King George III of Great Britain signed the Treaty of Paris in September that year, officially ending the war.

《独立宣言》以启蒙运动的主权和自然权利原则为蓝本，特别是作家和哲学家约翰·洛克的社会契约 论。尽管殖民者并不普遍支持独立，并且有相当一部分人保持中立或积极支持英国，但十三个殖民地 中有十二个最终批准了《独立宣言》，唯一弃权的是纽约。在随后发生的军事冲突中，英国最初赢得 了大部分战斗，但乔治·华盛顿将军领导的大陆军最终取得了胜利，英国人于 1781 年在弗吉尼亚州约 克镇投降。一些战斗一直持续到 1783 年秋天，但和平同年9月，新美国和英国国王乔治三世的代表签 署《巴黎条约》 ，正式宣布战争结束。

Following the war’s conclusion, the first written constitution, known as the Articles of Confederation, was drafted in 1776–1777 and ratified by the thirteen colonies in 1781. Although they named the new nation the United States of America and granted Congress the authority to coin money and make alliances, the Articles of Confederation did not enable the federal government to impose taxes or control foreign policy. These shortcomings led delegates at the Constitutional Convention to write the Constitution in 1787, which granted the federal government powers such as the authority to tax and to regulate interstate commerce. When the Constitution was officially adopted in 1789, it replaced the Articles of Confederation and significantly strengthened the country’s central governmental authority.

战争结束后，第一部成文宪法，即《邦联条例》 ，于 1776 年至 1777 年起草，并于 1781 年得到十三 个殖民地的批准。尽管他们将这个新国家命名为美利坚合众国，并授予国会制定宪法的权力金钱和结 盟，《邦联条例》并没有赋予联邦政府征税或控制外交政策的权力。这些缺陷促使制宪会议的代表们 于 1787 年制定了宪法，授予联邦政府权力，例如征税和监管州际贸易的权力。 1789年宪法正式通 过，它取代了《邦联条例》，大大加强了国家的中央政府权威。

In theory, the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution reflected the democratic ideals of the Enlightenment, but in practice, the colonists’ achievements were inherently contradictory, since many of the founders were slaveholders. Political liberty coexisted with the institution of slavery, and full constitutional rights and freedoms extended only to White men of property, a minority of the population, and not to women, African Americans, Native Americans, or many immigrants. Although women had participated in the war by leading charitable organizations and refusing to buy goods on which the British imposed taxes, they were excluded from political rights in the new republic. The institution of slavery, moreover, gained protection from the Constitution when members of the Constitutional Convention adopted the Three-Fifths Clause, which counted threefifths of the enslaved population in the calculations on which the taxation and political representation of slaveholding states were based. By effectively implying that enslaved people were less than fully human and denying them voting rights, this clause enshrined racial prejudice in the Constitution’s foundations. Though the Three-Fifths Clause was eventually repealed in 1868, the political disenfranchisement of Black citizens persisted until the civil rights era and beyond.

从理论上讲，《独立宣言》和美国宪法反映了启蒙运动的民主理想，但在实践中，殖民者的成就本质 上是矛盾的，因为许多创始人都是奴隶主。政治自由与奴隶制并存，宪法赋予的全部权利和自由只适 用于占人口少数的有财产的白人，而不适用于妇女、非裔美国人、美洲原住民或许多移民。尽管妇女 通过领导慈善组织并拒绝购买英国征税的商品来参与战争，但她们在新共和国中被排除在政治权利之 外。此外，当制宪会议成员通过“五分之三条款”时，奴隶制制度获得了宪法的保护，该条款在计算蓄奴 州税收和政治代表权的基础上计算了五分之三的奴隶人口。通过有效地暗示被奴役的人不是完全的人 并剥夺他们的投票权，该条款将种族偏见铭刻在宪法的基础中。尽管五分之三条款最终于 1868 年被废 除，但黑人公民的政治权利被剥夺的情况一直持续到民权时代及以后。

The American Revolutionary War was also an unmitigated catastrophe for Native Americans. Based on the fear that a colonial victory would devastate their lands and betray their interests, Native American leaders such as Mohawk chief Thayendanegea had formed alliances with the British and provided them with strategic military support. Revolutionary armies then destroyed Native American towns and crops in western New York and Pennsylvania. At the war’s conclusion, Native American representatives were excluded from all negotiations, which ultimately resulted in significant loss of their lands and autonomy.

美国独立战争对于美洲原住民来说也是一场彻头彻尾的灾难。由于担心殖民胜利会摧毁他们的土地并 背叛他们的利益，莫霍克族酋长塞延丹吉亚等美洲原住民领导人与英国结盟，并向他们提供战略军事 支持。随后，革命军队摧毁了纽约州西部和宾夕法尼亚州的美洲原住民城镇和农作物。战争结束时， 美洲原住民代表被排除在所有谈判之外，最终导致他们严重丧失土地和自治权。

It may be tempting to see the American Revolution as a full-fledged victory for Enlightenment ideals of popular sovereignty and natural rights, but the actual application of these principles was spotty at best. Traditional narratives typically cite the love of liberty as its guiding principle and celebrate its democratic achievements, but its causes were far more complex. British efforts to consolidate control over the colonies in the years leading up to the war incited resistance from colonists seeking to maintain their autonomy, but the war’s roots lay in a variety of economic, political, and ideological disputes. Colonial elites sought the same rights as their counterparts in Britain, and their demands to levy taxes themselves and their resistance to the Crown heavily influenced the initial desire for independence. Merchants, however, primarily sought economic freedoms that would release them from British trade restrictions and taxes. Still others resisted British attempts to curb westward expansion and appropriate Native American lands. Ultimately, these diverse motives converged with growing popular protest and incited rebellions and violence, eventually leading to revolution.

人们可能很容易将美国革命视为人民主权和自然权利的启蒙运动理想的全面胜利，但这些原则的实际 应用充其量是不稳定的。传统叙事通常将对自由的热爱作为其指导原则并庆祝其民主成就，但其原因 要复杂得多。战争前几年，英国巩固对殖民地控制的努力激起了寻求维持自治的殖民者的抵抗，但战 争的根源在于各种经济、政治和意识形态争端。殖民地精英寻求与英国同行相同的权利，他们自己征 税的要求和对王室的抵制极大地影响了最初的独立愿望。然而，商人主要寻求经济自由，从而摆脱英 国的贸易限制和税收。还有一些人抵制英国遏制向西扩张和侵占美洲原住民土地的企图。最终，这些 不同的动机与日益增长的民众抗议相结合，煽动叛乱和暴力，最终导致革命。(即美国独立战争存在各种人的动机理由)
