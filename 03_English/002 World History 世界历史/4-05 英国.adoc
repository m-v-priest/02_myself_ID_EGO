== 决定建立北美殖民地 (1584)

The English began their colonization efforts in the Americas nearly a century after the Spanish, motivated by both economic and ideological goals. In 1584, Queen Elizabeth gave Sir Walter Raleigh a charter, a royal document that authorized him to establish a colony in North America. The Protestant queen wanted colonies that would act as an ideological counterweight to Spanish Catholicism in the Americas and provide a base of operations for privateering expeditions that would raid Spanish shipping.

在比西班牙人晚近一个世纪后, 英国人才在经济和意识形态目标的推动下，开始在美洲进行殖民活动。 1584 年，伊丽莎白女王授予沃尔特·罗利爵士一份特许状，这是一份皇家文件，授权他在北美建立殖民地。 这位新教女王希望, 殖民地能够在意识形态上, 平衡掉西班牙天主教在美洲的地位，并为袭击西班牙航运的私掠探险, 提供行动基地。

==  Roanoke Island 罗阿诺克岛 (1587) → 失落的殖民地

In July 1587, about 150 settlers led by explorer and artist John White established a colony on Roanoke Island, off the coast of modern North Carolina.  +

In late August, White left for England with plans to gather additional investors to fund the colony. Once there, he convinced English merchants to invest in the colony in exchange for trading rights, but the arrival of the Spanish Armada in 1588 delayed his departure.  +

When White finally returned to Roanoke Island in 1590, the colony was gone. The only clue White found was the word “Croatoan” carved into a tree. It is also possible the word had nothing to do with the colony’s disappearance. Today, Roanoke Island is known as “the lost colony,” and its fate remains a mystery.

1587 年 7 月，在探险家兼艺术家约翰·怀特(John White) 的带领下，约 150 名定居者在现今的北卡罗来纳州海岸附近的"罗阿诺克岛"建立了殖民地。 +
八月下旬，怀特返回英国，计划召集更多投资者来为该殖民地提供资金. 他说服英国商人在该殖民地投资, 以换取贸易权，但 1588 年西班牙无敌舰队的到来, 推迟了他的离开。 +
1590 年，当怀特最终返回"罗阿诺克岛"时，这个殖民地已经消失了。怀特发现的唯一线索, 是刻在一棵树上的“克罗地亚人”这个词。也有可能这个词与殖民地的消失无关。如今，罗阿诺克岛被称为“失落的殖民地”，其命运仍然是个谜。

'''

==  Jamestown 詹姆斯敦 (1607)

The creation of joint stock companies provided English colonial efforts after Roanoke Island with improved funding that the English monarchy could not offer.

Shareholders were not legally liable for the actions of the company and could not lose more than the amount of their investment, but they could earn large profits if the joint stock company were successful.

England promoted colonization for religious and political reasons, but its reliance on private investors for funding often steered the effort toward profitable activities.

股份公司的创建, 为英国在"罗阿诺克岛"之后的殖民努力, 提供了英国君主无法提供的更好的资金来源。股东对公司的行为不承担法律责任，损失也不会超过其投资额，但如果股份公司成功，他们可以获得巨额利润。

英国出于宗教和政治原因, 推动殖民，但它对私人投资者资金的依赖, 往往使其努力转向有利可图的经商活动。

In 1606, the Virginia Company, a joint stock company named for Queen Elizabeth (who was known as the “virgin queen” because she never married), received a charter and sent 144 men and boys to North America. +

In 1607, these colonists founded Jamestown, named for the new English king, James I, on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay in what is now Virginia.

1606年，弗吉尼亚公司，一家以伊丽莎白女王（因未婚而被称为“童贞女王”）命名的股份公司，获得了一份特许状，将144名男子和男孩送往北美。 1607 年，这些殖民者在切萨皮克湾（现在的弗吉尼亚州）沿岸建立了"詹姆斯敦"，以新任英国国王詹姆斯一世的名字命名。

The English government hoped the Virginia Company would find gold to improve the nation’s trade balances and increase its wealth. Many in Jamestown also hoped to find gold and thereby get rich without having to work hard or suffer any hardships.

(基于重商主义思想,) 英国政府希望弗吉尼亚公司能够找到黄金, 来改善国家的贸易平衡并增加财富。詹姆斯敦的许多人也希望找到黄金，从而无需辛苦工作, 或不用受苦就能致富。

The Jamestown settlers did not find gold because there was little mineral wealth in the region, but they did find suffering due to bad weather, starvation, disease, internal political disputes, and military conflicts with the Powhatan tribe (named after its chief).  Many colonists died during the winter of 1609–1610, known as “the starving time.” By May 1610, fewer than a hundred remained, and the colony, which had not produced a profit for the Virginia Company, almost failed.

詹姆斯敦的定居者没有发现黄金，因为该地区几乎没有矿产资源，但由于恶劣的天气、饥饿、疾病、内部政治纠纷, 以及与波瓦坦部落（以其首领的名字命名）的军事冲突，他们确实遭受了苦难。许多殖民者在1609-1610年的冬天死亡，这被称为“饥饿时期”。到1610年5月，只剩下不到100人，这个殖民地没有给弗吉尼亚公司带来利润，几乎失败了。

Early Virginia colonists did find wealth and success in tobacco cultivation, however. By 1614 Jamestown began exporting tobacco to Europe and earning profits for the Virginia Company.

然而，早期的弗吉尼亚殖民者, 确实在烟草种植中找到了财富和成功。到 1614 年，詹姆斯敦开始向欧洲出口烟草，为弗吉尼亚公司赚取利润.

== 普利茅斯 (五月花号公约) (1620)

In 1620, Puritan Separatists led by William Bradford left Plymouth, England, on the Mayflower and founded a colony they called Plymouth near what is now Boston, Massachusetts. The Separatists wanted to leave England to escape the Church of England.

Before landing, their leaders signed the Mayflower Compact. More than just a religious document, the Mayflower Compact also had a major political impact with its support of direct democracy and of building governments that reflected the will of the people.

1620 年，威廉·布拉德福德(William Bradford) 领导的清教徒分离主义者, 乘五月花号离开英国普利茅斯，在现马萨诸塞州波士顿附近建立了一个殖民地，称为普利茅斯。分离主义者想要离开英格兰，以逃避英国国教. 登陆前，他们的领导人签署了《五月花号公约》. 《五月花号公约》不仅仅是一份宗教文件，它还具有重大的政治影响，因为它支持直接民主, 和建立反映人民意愿的政府。

==  马萨诸塞湾殖民地 (山巅之城) (1630)

A larger group of Puritans followed in 1630 and founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Their leader John Winthrop gave a speech titled “A Model of Christian Charity,” which expressed his hopes that the Puritan community in the Americas would embrace the twin goals of building economic prosperity and founding a “City upon a Hill” that would serve as a shining example of an ideal Christian community to the entire world.

1630 年，更多的清教徒紧随其后, 并建立了马萨诸塞湾殖民地。他们的领袖约翰·温思罗普发表了题为“基督教慈善的典范”的演讲，表达了他希望美洲的清教徒社区, 能够实现建设经济繁荣, 和建立一个“山巅之城”的双重目标，这个目标将成为全世界理想基督教社区的光辉榜样。

The Puritan colonies were also scenes of religious conflict from which dissenters like Anne Hutchinson, who questioned the all-male church leadership, and Roger Williams, who championed religious toleration, were exiled.

The Massachusetts Bay Colony’s darkest moment may have come during the 1692 Salem witch trials, when Puritan leaders executed nineteen people for witchcraft.

清教徒殖民地, 也是宗教冲突的场所，像质疑"教会的全男性领导"的安妮·哈钦森（Anne Hutchinson）和 倡导宗教宽容的罗杰·威廉姆斯（Roger Williams）等持不同政见者, 都被流放。 +
马萨诸塞湾殖民地最黑暗的时刻, 可能发生在 1692 年塞勒姆女巫审判期间，当时清教徒领袖以巫术罪处决了 19 人。

Despite such conflicts, the Puritan colonies eventually became self-sustaining communities that mostly achieved their twin objectives of promoting Puritan religious ideology and building a strong economy.

尽管存在这些冲突，清教徒殖民地最终还是成为了自给自足的社区，大部分实现了推广清教徒宗教意识形态, 和建立强大经济的双重目标。

Puritan settlers hoped a strong economy would allow their colony to flourish, attract new settlers, and provide evidence of God’s favor. Like many Europeans of the 1600s and 1700s, they rooted their economic ideas in mercantilism.

The desire to build economic wealth was the primary motive in many colonial ventures, such as Jamestown in Virginia, and provided a secondary motivation in more ideologically driven communities like those set up by the Puritans.

清教徒定居者希望, 强大的经济能够让他们的殖民地繁荣发展，吸引新的定居者，并提供上帝恩惠的证据。像 1600 年代和 1700 年代的许多欧洲人一样，他们的经济思想植根于"重商主义"。建立经济财富的愿望, 是许多殖民事业的主要动机，例如在弗吉尼亚州的詹姆斯敦. 而在更多受意识形态驱动的社区（例如清教徒建立的社区）中, 则提供了次要动机。

==  英法七年战争 (1756-1763) (英国战胜法国和西班牙) → 由于各自的军事联盟, 而将很多国家拖下水, 引发世界性大战 (这个亏以后又吃了一次, 导致了第一次世界大战)

=== 七年战争的起因

The Seven Years’ War had begun in Europe in 1756 when Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Saxony and annexed the area as part of his broader plan to expand Prussian territory. In response, France, Spain, and Russia joined forces with Austria to oppose him.

Great Britain allied itself with Prussia to maintain the balance of power in Europe, a situation in which competing nations have approximately equal military power. Maintaining this balance was a key feature of British foreign policy meant to prevent the domination of Europe by any one nation. Military alliances thus transformed what could have been a small border dispute in Europe into a major war that quickly spread around the world.

1756 年，欧洲爆发了七年战争，当时普鲁士腓特烈大帝, 入侵萨克森并吞并了该地区，作为其扩张普鲁士领土的更广泛计划的一部分。作为回应，法国、西班牙和俄罗斯与奥地利联手反对他。 +
英国与普鲁士结盟, 以维持欧洲的力量平衡，在这种情况下，竞争国家拥有大致平等的军事力量。保持这种"势力均衡"是英国外交政策的一个关键特征，旨在防止任何一个国家统治欧洲。也正因此，军事联盟就将欧洲的一场小规模边界争端, 转变为了一场迅速蔓延到世界各地的重大战争. (军事联盟, 使自己被拉下水, 拖入战争中. 犹如一战爆发的原因一样)

===  七年战争的过程

In 1758, a British expeditionary force captured the French outpost of Senegal in West Africa, and other French outposts were taken during a series of subsequent offensives. The loss of valuable trading ports damaged the French economy at the very moment France desperately needed money to fund the war effort. More importantly, it deprived French military forces of strategic bases they could have used to raid British shipping and resupply their warships.

1758年，英国远征军占领了法国在西非的塞内加尔前哨，并在随后的一系列攻势中占领了法国的其他前哨。就在法国迫切需要资金来资助战争之际，宝贵的贸易港口的丧失损害了法国经济。更重要的 是，它剥夺了法国军队本来可以用来袭击英国航运和补给军舰的战略基地。

In 1762, the British launched attacks on Spanish colonies in Asia and the Caribbean.

1762年，英国对西班牙在亚洲和加勒比海的殖民地, 发动了攻击.

=== 战后的条约与影响 → 英国成为世界强国

The French and Indian War ended with the victory of Great Britain and Prussia over France and Spain in the Seven Years’ War and the signing of the Treaty of Paris in February 1763. Under the treaty, the French government surrendered all its territory in North America, as well as outposts in the Caribbean, India, and Africa.

法印战争, 以"英国和普鲁士"在七年战争中战胜"法国和西班牙"而结束，并于 1763 年 2 月签署《巴黎条约》 。根据该条约，法国政府交出了其在北美的全部领土, 以及加勒比海、印度和非洲的前哨基地。

With the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the French surrendered their imperial possessions in North America and India to the British, while the Spanish surrendered Florida to the British and France gave control of the Louisiana Territory to Spain. The subsequent Peace of Hubertusburg guaranteed Prussian control of Silesia, an area in central Europe, and confirmed Prussia’s status as a major force in Europe. The British, for their part, emerged from the Seven Years’ War as the world’s leading economic, military, and political power.

随着《巴黎条约》的签署，法国将"北美"和"印度"交给了英国，西班牙将"佛罗里达"交给了英国，法国将"路易斯安那"领土的控制权交给了西班牙。随后的《胡伯图斯堡和约》保证了普鲁士对 中欧地区"西里西亚"的控制，并确立了普鲁士作为欧洲主要力量的地位。就英国而言，他们在七年战争中成为世界领先的经济、军事和政治强国。

The Seven Years’ War and the subsequent Treaty of Paris, signed in 1763, effectively brought French power in India to an end.

七年战争和随后于 1763 年签署的《巴黎条约》, 实际上结束了法国在印度的势力.

In the mid-1700s, the British Empire grew from a minor player on the world stage to a dominant superpower. Victory in the Seven Years’ War consolidated their power over European rivals. In hopes of further increasing their political and economic power, many supported further expansion of the empire into new areas. Britain therefore expanded its colonies in India and turned its eyes to China.

1700年代中期 (七年战争前后)，大英帝国从世界舞台上的一个小角色成长为一个占主导地位的超级大国。七年战争的胜利巩固了他们对欧洲对手的实力。为了进一步增强政治和经济实力，许多人支持帝国进一步向新领域扩张。英国因此扩大在印度的殖民地，并将目光转向中国。

==  英国东印度公司 → 获得"印度洋贸易垄断权” (1600)

In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I of England granted a monopoly on trade in the Indian Ocean to the British East India Company (also known as the English East India Company or the East India Company).

The political entity of Britain was formed after the union of England and Scotland following the death of Elizabeth I. The kingdom of Great Britain was officially formed in 1707. It is a bit anachronistic to refer to the British East India Company before the nation of Great Britain existed, but that is the name by which the company is most commonly known.

1600年， 英国女王伊丽莎白一世将印度洋贸易垄断权, 授予"英国东印度公司"。

英国的政治实体, 是在伊丽莎白一世去世后, 英格兰和苏格兰联合后形成的。大不列颠王国于 1707 年正式成立。在真正英国诞生前, 提及"英国东印度公司"其实有点不合时宜。但这的确是该公司最广为人知的名字。

The British East India Company was a joint stock company in which numerous merchants pooled their money to fund trading voyages and share the profits. An expedition to India required an enormous outlay of money that few individuals could afford, and if they could, they might lose their entire fortunes if the expedition were unsuccessful. By pooling funds, none had to risk all they owned.

英国东印度公司是一家股份公司，众多商人汇集资金, 为贸易航行提供资金, 并分享利润。远征印度需要巨额开支，很少有人能负担得起，即使有能力，如果远征不成功，他们也可能会倾家荡产。通过汇集资金，任何人都不必拿自己拥有的一切去冒险。

==  控制香港 (1842, 中英南京条约), 并获得在中国的治外法权 (1843)

In 1842, Great Britain and China signed the Treaty of Nanjing, which forced China to surrender Hong Kong to Great Britain, opened five ports to European traders, and gave the British a favorable trading status.

The following year, a second treaty allowed British citizens in China to be tried in British courts for violations of the law, making them immune from prosecution by Chinese authorities.

(第一次鸦片战争后,)  1842年，中英签订《南京条约》 ，迫使中国将香港割让给英国，并向欧洲商人开放五个港口，并给予英国有利的贸易地位。次年，第二项条 约允许在华英国公民因违法行为而在英国法院接受审判，从而免受中国当局的起诉。(治外法权)

Britain won the First Opium War (1839–1842), gaining control over Hong Kong and five other ports: Guangzhou, Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Xiamen.

In 1844, China also signed treaties with France and the United States, giving them the right to trade in the five open ports and build Christian churches in and send missionaries to China.

英国赢得了第一次鸦片战争（1839-1842），控制了香港和 五个港口：广州、上海、宁波、福州和厦门。 +

==  控制印度 (1858-1947)

Despite Britain’s expansion into Africa, India remained its most important overseas territory. India had been a possession of the British East India Company, which directly ruled approximately half of India. In 1857, however, Muslim and Hindu soldiers in the company’s employ, known as sepoys, rose in revolt. In 1858, following the British army’s suppression of the revolt, Parliament disbanded the British East India Company and took control of the territory it had ruled.

Local rulers whose authority the East India Company acknowledged and who had remained loyal were left in nominal control of their kingdoms, but in reality, they became subservient to Britain.

Queen Victoria was officially proclaimed empress of India in 1876, and the last Mughal emperor, who had not been active in the revolt, was sent into exile. This transfer of power began the period of direct British rule called the British Raj.

尽管英国向非洲扩张，印度仍然是其最重要的海外领土。印度曾是英国东印度公司的属地，该公司直接统治着大约一半的印度。然而，1857 年，该公司雇佣的穆斯林和印度教士兵（称为“土兵” ）发动叛乱。 1858年，英国军队镇压叛乱后，议会解散了"英国东印度公司"，并接管了其统治的领土。

那些被东印度公司承认并在起义期间保持忠诚的地方统治者, 在名义上保留了对其王国的控制权，但实际上他们成为了英国的附属。

1876 年，维多利亚女王被正式封为印度女皇，而未积极参与叛乱的莫卧儿末代皇帝, 则被流放。这次权力转移, 标志着开始了英国直接统治的时期，称为“英属统治” 。

The Indian Mutiny convinced the British government that the owners of the British East India Company were unable to effectively govern India. The government thus abolished the company, took control of British India in 1858, and directly ruled the territory until it became independent in 1947.

The period from 1858 to 1947 is therefore known as the British Raj (raj means “rule” in Sanskrit), or the British Paramountcy, which meant rule of India by the British government through the Viceroy of India.

印度兵变让英国政府相信, "英国东印度公司"的所有者无法有效治理印度。政府因此废除了公司，于1858年控制了英属印度，并直接统治该领土，直至1947年印度独立。1858年至1947年期间因此被称为"英属印度"（ raj在梵语中意为“统治”），或英国至高无上，这意味着英国政府通过"印度总督"来统治印度。

Through a combination of alliances and military victories and the use they made of existing divisions between its kingdoms and rulers, the British gradually gained control of India.

通过进行联盟, 和军事胜利的结合，以及他们利用其王国和统治者之间的现有分歧，英国逐渐获得了对印度的控制。

==  获得在北京设立办事机构, 和进行贸易的权力 (1858, 天津条约)

China’s loss to Britain in the Second Opium War (1856–1860) led to the signing of the Treaty of Tianjin, which gave Britain, France, the United States, and Russia further rights to trade and establish diplomatic posts in the capital of Beijing.

China refused to honor the treaty, however, and British and French troops invaded Beijing in 1860, looting and burning the imperial Old Summer Palace (Figure 9.12). The subsequent Convention of Beijing affirmed the Treaty of Tianjin.

中国在第二次鸦片战争（1856-1860）中输英国，签订了《天津条约》 ，该条约赋予英国、法国、美国和俄罗斯进一步在首都北京进行贸易, 和建立机构的权利。 +
然而，中国拒绝遵守该条约，英法军队于 1860 年入侵北京，抢劫并焚烧了圆明园。随后的"北京条约"确认了《天津条约》 。

'''

== 令清朝取消对外国人进入中国的几乎所有限制 ( 1860, 北京条约)

The war ended in 1860 with the Convention of Beijing, which ceded select Chinese territories to Russia, expanded the borders of British-controlled Hong Kong, prevented religious discrimination against Christians, and eliminated almost all restrictions on foreign access to China.

The treaty also led to a continuous series of other treaties between the west and China—later referred to by the Chinese as “unequal treaties” because they were imposed rather than negotiated.

(第二次鸦片战争后,) 1860年，战争随着《北京条约》的签订而结束，该公约将部分中国领土割让给俄罗斯，扩大了英国控制的香港的边界，防止对基督徒的宗教歧视，并取消了对外国人进入中国的几乎所有限制。

该条约还导致西方与中国之间不断签订一系列其他条约——后来被中国人称为“不平等条约”，因为它们是强加的, 而不是谈判达成的。

'''

== 获得在清朝的驻军权 (1901, the Boxer Protocol 辛丑条约)

In 1899, the Boxers began their campaign to drive foreigners from China. Terrified foreigners streamed into Beijing seeking protection, but Cixi encouraged them to leave. Fearing for their lives, they barricaded themselves inside the embassies in the foreign quarter of Beijing. Cixi then proclaimed her allegiance to the Boxers and declared war on foreigners within China.

Swiftly Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Japan, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Italy formed the Eight-Nation Alliance, and their troops raced to Beijing. After a siege of fifty-five days, the international force arrived and the Boxers were dispersed, killed, or captured. In September 1901, the Boxer Protocol was signed, officially ending the incident. China was forbidden to import weapons for two years, and foreign legations were given the right to keep troops of their own nation for their defense. China also awarded $330 million to the members of the Eight-Nation Alliance.

1899年, 义和团开始驱逐外国人. 外国人涌入北京寻求保护，藏在使馆区内. 慈禧向外国宣战. 英、法、德、美、日、俄、奥匈、意等国迅速组成八国同盟，奔赴北京。经过五十五天的围困后，驱散义和团. 1901年9月，《the Boxer Protocol 辛丑条约》签署，中国被禁止在两年内进口武器，外国使馆有权保留本国军队用于防卫。中国还向八国赔款3.3亿美元。

== 放弃殖民印度, 印巴各自独立 (1947.8)

Like Indonesia, India sought to plot its own path and remain free of the entangling alliances of the Cold War, and it was also one of the initiators of the Non-Aligned Movement.

In 1947, the United Kingdom granted India its independence. Exhausted from fighting World War II, Britain could no longer afford to maintain control over its colony. In addition, although the United Kingdom had sufficient troops there, the majority were Indian, and it was uncertain where their loyalties lay.

Finally, the United Kingdom’s greatest ally and creditor, the United States, pressured the nation to grant India its independence, as the United States had given independence to the Philippines following the war.

与印度尼西亚一样，印度也寻求走自己的路，摆脱冷战时期纠缠不清的联盟，也是"不结盟运动"的发起者之一。

1947年，英国给予印度独立。 由于二战的打击，英国精疲力尽，再也无法维持对其殖民地的控制。此外，英国虽然在那里有足够的军队，但大多数是印度人，他们的效忠对象是谁也不确定。最后，英国最大的盟友和债权人美国, 向英国施压，要求其给予印度独立，就像美国在战后给予菲律宾独立一样。

The announcement that the British would be withdrawing sparked waves of religious violence throughout the nation. Much of it was caused by a dispute over what an independent India would consist of. Hindus in the Indian National Congress called for the maintenance of a single, unified India. Muslims, however, feared that the Hindu majority would dominate the government to their detriment, and many were reluctant to agree to such a situation.

A compromise was reached, and at midnight on August 15, 1947, when India achieved its independence, the region of Pakistan, home to a Muslim majority, became an independent nation as well.

英国宣布撤军的消息, 引发了全国范围内的宗教暴力浪潮。其中很大一部分原因, 是关于"独立后的印度将由什么组成的"争论造成的。印度"国大党"中的"印度教徒", 呼吁维持单一、统一的印度。然而，穆斯林则担心, 占多数的"印度教徒"会主导政府，对他们不利，许多人不愿意同意这种情况。

最终双方达成妥协，1947 年 8 月 15 日午夜，印度获得独立，穆斯林占多数的"巴基斯坦"地区也成为一个独立国家。
