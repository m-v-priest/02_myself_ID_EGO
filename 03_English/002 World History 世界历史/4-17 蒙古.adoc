== 欧亚草原的部落

=== clan 氏族

The clan, a small group of several families that shared an encampment and herded or hunted together, was the basic unit of steppe society. Each clan had a ruling lineage from which leaders were selected and that intermarried with other lineages to avoid in-breeding. Thus, the ruling lineages formed an aristocracy of sorts.

几个家庭的联合, 即氏族. 它是草原社会的基本单位。联合的目的是: 共享一个营地，或一起放牧, 狩猎.

每个氏族都有一个统治世系，从中选出领导人，并与其他血统通婚以避免近亲繁殖。因此，统治世系形成了某种贵族制。

'''

===  tribes 部落

Clans joined together to form tribes under a single leader to better protect their herds and households, cooperate on resource management and migration, and engage in united actions like raids on other clans.

Eurasian tribes were loosely organized, often multiethnic and multilingual, not exclusive to a kinship network, and open to any who were willing to obey the leader. Clans drifted in and out of tribes depending on their needs and wishes.

氏族的联合, 即形成部落. 目的也是为了进行联合行动.

部落是比较开放的, 氏族进出自由. 因此部落并不局限于亲属关系网络. 也有着"多种族"和"多语言”.

'''

===  confederation 联盟

Multiple tribes periodically united around a single skillful or charismatic leader, creating a larger confederation. This unity was very short-lived, rarely lasting beyond a generation or two.

多个部落的暂时联合, 即形成联盟. 这种联合非常短暂，很少能持续超过一两代人。

'''

=== 收养儿童和寡妇

Given the high mortality among the steppe peoples, the adoption of children and widows was commonplace. Most households included some enslaved people. Children, wives, enslaved people, and livestock were often obtained by raiding weaker, underprepared clans.

由于草原人民的死亡率很高，收养儿童和寡妇是司空见惯的事. 大多数家庭都包括一些奴隶。儿童、妻子、奴隶和牲畜, 往往是通过袭击"实力较弱、准备不足的部落"而获得的。

== 金+宋 -> 灭辽 (1125年)

image:/img/0024.jpg[,80%]

In 1004, the Song and the Liao agreed to the Treaty of Shanyuan. In it, both the Song and the Liao emperors were referred to as Sons of Heaven. The two states were recognized as equals. Tellingly, however, on the issue of tribute, the Song were obligated to give the Liao an annual payment of 200,000 bolts of silk and 130,000 ounces of silver (worth about USD$2.7 million in 2020 prices). No reciprocal obligation of the Liao to give tribute to the Song was specified.

The Song resented this relationship with the Liao, and in 1120 they bankrolled the revolt of one of Khitan Liao’s tributary states, the Jurchen. Once the Liao and the Jurchen were locked in combat, the Song attacked from the south. Exploiting divisions within the Liao kingdom, the Song and the Jurchen were victorious by 1125.

1004年，宋辽签订《澶渊(之盟)条约》，宋朝和辽朝的皇帝都被称为天子。两国被认为是平等的. 然而，值得注意的是，在进贡问题上，宋朝有义务每年向辽国缴纳20万匹丝绸, 和13万盎司白银（按2020年价格计算，价值约270万美元）。没有具体规定辽朝向宋朝贡的相互义务。

宋朝对与辽国的这种关系感到不满，并于1120年资助了契丹辽朝的一个朝贡国女真人的叛乱。当辽国与女真交战时，宋军从南方进攻。利用辽国内部的分裂，宋朝和女真人于1125年取得胜利。

The remnants of the Liao royal family fled west with supporters and founded the Kara-Khitan state. The Jurchen assumed rule of the former Liao lands as the Jin dynasty.

The absorption of the Kara-Khitan into the Mongol Empire had provided a direct border with the Islamic world through Khwarazmia, a realm stretching from Persia through central Asia.

辽王室的残余势力带着支持者西逃，建立了"喀喇契丹国"。女真人继承了金朝对前辽国的统治。

(后来,) 喀喇契丹被蒙古帝国吞并，通过"花剌子模"（一个从波斯延伸到中亚的领土）, 蒙古与伊斯兰世界建立了直接边界。

'''

== 金 -> 灭北宋 (1127年)

The Jin were not content to supplant the Liao. The Jin attacked the Song in 1126. Huizong quickly abdicated in favor of his eldest son, Qinzong. Qinzong dispatched a peace mission, led by his halfbrother Gaozong. The Jin took the mission hostage and extracted a hefty ransom and annual tribute to release its members and end the hostilities.

The peace proved short-lived as Qinzong tried to entice the former Liao mandarins, who were now working in service to the Jin, to revolt. They reported Qinzong’s clumsy intrigues to the Jin emperor, who launched a more protracted attack.

Bent on conquest and revenge this time, the Jin refused to be bought, and in 1127 they took the Song capital and seized the entire imperial household, goods, and people, including Huizong and Qinzong. In what became known as the Jingkang incident, the Jin went on a three-week rampage of raping and looting throughout the city.

金人并不满足于取代辽人, 于 1126 年进攻宋朝。"徽宗"很快退位，让位给他的长子钦宗. "钦宗"派遣了一个和平使团，由他同父异母的哥哥"高宗"率领。金人将使团扣为人质，并索取巨额赎金和年度贡品，以释放其成员, 并结束敌对行动。

事实证明，和平是短暂的，因为钦宗试图引诱"现在为金国效力的前辽朝官员"起义。他们向金皇帝报告了钦宗的拙劣阴谋，金国皇帝发起了更持久的攻击。这次金人一心要征服和复仇，不肯被收买，于1127年占领了宋都，并夺取了整个皇室、货物和人民，包括徽宗和钦宗。在后来的"靖康事件"中，金人在全城进行了长达三周的奸淫掠夺。

==  12世纪后期, 中国北方的草原部落

Many clans and dozens of tribes occupied the Mongolian grasslands in the late twelfth century. Settled peoples like the Jin and Song had long incited these nomadic groups against one another.

12世纪后期，许多氏族和数十个部落, 占领了蒙古草原。金、宋等定居民族, 长期以来一直煽动这些游牧民族互相争斗.

Mongol Tribes and the Three Steppe Kingdoms. This map shows (in yellow) the areas that various Mongol tribes considered their lands in the late twelfth century and where they were in relation to the three settled kingdoms of the Kara-Khitan, Xia, and Jin between the steppe and the Southern Song dynasty.

== 蒙古 -> 灭西夏 (1227年)

The Xi Xia refused to send troops to aid the war against the Khwarazmians, an act Chinggis saw as a betrayal. After defeating the Khwarazmians, he invaded the Xi Xia lands to punish them for this disloyalty. However, he died several months before the completion of his conquest.

(由于)西夏拒绝派兵援助对抗"花剌子模"的战争，成吉思汗认为这是一种背叛。在击败花剌子模人后，他入侵西夏, 以惩罚他们的不忠。然而，他在完成征服前几个月就去世了. (成吉思汗死于1227年8月. 西夏在1227年灭亡)

'''

== 蒙古 -> 灭金 (1234年)

In 1161, concerned that a confederation led by Mongolian speakers was growing too powerful, the Jin encouraged and supported a confederation led by Tatars to attack the Mongol-led confederation. Tatar was a Turkish language.

(The fluidity of membership in clans, tribes, and confederations makes it problematic to consider a group led by a speaker of one language as truly having a common ethnic heritage or long-standing communal bond such as a modern nation has. Nevertheless, perhaps for the sake of simplicity, scholars tend to refer to confederations of seminomads by the primary language of their leader.)

1161年，金朝担心蒙古联盟变得过于强大，因此鼓励并支持"鞑靼联盟", 进攻"蒙古联盟"。鞑靼语是一种土耳其语.

（注意: 部落、氏族和部族联盟的成员, 具有流动性，因此, 将由某种语言的使用者所领导的群体, 视为"他们真的具有共同的民族血统"或"像现代国家那样, 具有长期的共同纽带", 这种看法是有问题的。尽管如此，也许对于为了简单起见，学者们倾向于用其领导人的主要语言, 来指称半游牧民族的联盟。）

There are no historical records of Temujin before he became known as Chinggis Khan. A work called The Secret History of the Mongols, likely written after his death, is the most potentially reliable source, though it is suspect because it is based solely on oral history interpreted by non-Mongols.

在铁木真成为成吉思汗之前，没有关于他的历史记录。一本名为《蒙古秘史》的书可能是在他死后写成的，是最有可能可靠的来源，尽管它值得怀疑，因为它完全基于非蒙古人解释的口述历史。

At some point in the early 1180s, Temujin broke with his friend and clan leader Jamukha and formed a new clan with himself as head.

As the clans allied with Temujin grew, Jamukha expanded his clan to keep up with him. Soon those in the Mongol-speaking part of the steppe were left with the choice of joining Temujin, joining Jamukha, or risking attack by one or the other.

1180 年代初的某个时候，铁木真与他的朋友兼部落首领"札木合"决裂，并组建了一个以自己为首领的新部落。

随着与铁木真结盟的氏族不断壮大，札木合也扩展了他的氏族以与之抗衡。很快，在蒙古语系的草原上，人们就只面临着三种选择：或者加入铁木真; 或者加入札木合; 或者哪方也不加入,但冒被其中一方攻击的风险。

Chinggis Khan believed that without new sources of wealth and glory, people might grow restless and reject the peace he tried to create. His life experience had given him no concept of settled economic development or ways to redirect his people’s energy to that goal. Chinggis knew settled peoples were a source of wealth ripe for the Mongol Empire to take. In his eyes, conquering these peoples or intimidating them into giving tribute was the next logical step.

成吉思汗担心, 如果不给手下人带来新的财富和荣耀, 他们可能会对自己不忠, 并反叛. 成吉思汗的经历, 不可能给他带来如今的"经济发展"的概念，也不存在如何"让他的人民转向这个目标"的方法. 他只知道财富是可以掠夺来的, 因此, 征服这些民族, 或恐吓他们进贡, 是下一个合乎逻辑的步骤。

The Kara-Khitan, assuming resistance would not go well, offered tribute to Chinggis Khan. After a coup in 1210, the new Xi Xia ruler accepted tributary status on terms similar to those of the Kara-Khitan.

首先是喀喇契丹人认为抵抗不会顺利，于是向成吉思汗进贡。 1210年政变后，新的西夏统治者也接受了类似于喀喇契丹的朝贡地位。

The Jin, however, were another matter. In 1210, a new Jin emperor demanded Chinggis Khan submit to him and send tribute, so Chinggis marched his smaller but superior army south to invade (Figure 14.9). A master at exploiting his opponents’ weaknesses, he realized that his linguistic cousins, the Khitan, resented the rule of the Jurchen Jin dynasty, so he portrayed his army as a liberating force for them. With their army swelling with Jin defectors, the Mongols were able to lay siege to Zhongdu, the Jin capital, and eventually seize the starving city. Chinggis Khan ordered the city thoroughly looted, tens of thousands enslaved, and untold numbers of others massacred.

Once the spoils from Zhongdu had been gathered, Chinggis Khan and his army headed back to the steppe, leaving the campaign against the Jin mostly in the hands of his Khitan allies.

然而金国却是另一回事。 1210年，金的新皇帝要求成吉思汗臣服, 并进贡，于是成吉思汗率领规模较小但实力雄厚的军队南下入侵。他是一位善于利用对手弱点的高手，他意识到他的语言近亲契丹人, 对女真金王朝的统治感到不满，因此他将他的军队描绘成一支解放他们的力量。随着金朝叛逃者的增 多，蒙古人得以围攻金都中都，并最终占领这座饥饿的城市。成吉思汗下令对这座城市洗劫，数万人被奴役，无数人被屠杀。

中都的战利品收集完毕后，成吉思汗和他的军队返回草原，将对抗金人的战役, 主要交给了他的契丹盟 友。

To intimidate the tributary states, Ogedei attacked and defeated the Jin by 1234.

为了恐吓朝贡国，窝阔台于1234年进攻并击败金国 (金朝灭亡)。

'''

==  蒙古 -> 灭南宋 (1279年)

Gaozong, who proved much more politically adept than his father or his brother, had been sent south to lead reinforcements back to the capital. Upon learning of the capital’s fall, Gaozong united the military and mandarins behind him, proclaimed himself emperor, and rallied Song forces to halt the Jin advance. This event is considered the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty.

War continued to rage until the 1140s, when the two sides agreed to the Treaty of Shaoxing, in which Gaozong ceded all Song territory north of the Huai River to the Jin, acknowledged the Song’s tributary status to the Jin, and agreed to pay an annual tribute of 250,000 bolts of silk and 325,000 ounces of silver (more than USD$6.7 million today).

(金灭北宋时, )事实证明，高宗在政治上比他的父亲或兄弟, 要熟练得多，高宗之前被派往南方，率领援军返回首都。在高宗得知首都失陷后，联合军队和官员，称帝，并集结宋军阻止金军前进。这一事件被认为是南宋王朝的开始。

战争持续激烈，直到1140年代，双方签订了《绍兴条约》(绍兴和议) ，高宗将淮河以北的所有宋国领土割让给金国，承认宋朝对金朝的朝贡地位，并同意每年缴纳贡金。贡品有 25 万匹丝绸, 和 32.5 万盎司白银（今天价值超过 670 万美元）。

By 1200, the Southern Song population was roughly the same size as it had been under the last census of the Song, despite encompassing much less land, and the economy seemed to have recovered to prewar levels.

到1200年， 南宋人口规模与宋朝上次人口普查时大致相同，尽管土地面积少得多，而且经济似乎已恢复到战前水平。

More than pursuing a life of conquest, Ogedei wanted to siphon off wealth as tribute through control of Eurasia’s trade routes. 1235, Ogedei called a kurultai to decide which lands should be conquered to provide it. After much debate, it was decided to attack both Europe and Song China.

(蒙古)窝阔台不仅追求征服的生活，还想通过控制欧亚大陆的贸易路线, 来攫取财富作为贡品。1235年，窝阔台召集了库鲁台, 来决定应该征服哪些土地。经过多次争论，决定同时进攻欧洲和宋朝中国。

Ogedei had given no thought to succession, however, and almost a decade of infighting occurred after his death. It took until 1251 for majority support to coalesce around Chinggis Khan’s grandson Mongke. His brother Kublai Khan was sent to Song China.

然而，窝阔台并没有考虑过继承问题，他死后又发生了近十年的内讧. 直到 1251 年，大多数人才支持成吉思汗的孙子蒙哥。 他一个兄弟忽必烈则被派往(占领)宋朝中国。

解释: +
"His brother Kublai Khan was sent to Song China." 里面没有逗号，句子就是暗示说他有多个兄弟，而其中一个是 Kublai Khan。 +
如果改成 "His brother, Kublai Khan, was sent to Song China." ，中间的两个逗号是为了提供一个附加信息（appositive），即“他的兄弟”是谁——Kublai Khan。这种结构是非限制性的附加信息，表示 Kublai Khan 是唯一被提及的兄弟，读者已经知道“他的兄弟”是谁。

Although Kublai attempted to subdue the Song while fighting Ariq Boke, he did not begin serious efforts to conquer them until 1265. It took over a dozen years, but by 1279, the Song military was broken and its royal family dead or in hiding.

In the year 1279, many Song loyalists, approximately 250,000 people in over a thousand oceancapable boats, anchored off a remote bay near modern Yamen, China. There they prepared for a last stand. Within a few days, the Songs’ supply of fresh water ran out. Morale among the Song collapsed, and most of them committed suicide by jumping into the sea.

尽管忽必烈试图在与阿里不哥作战的同时, 征服宋朝，但直到1265年, 他才开始认真地征服南宋。这花了十几年的时间，到了1279年，宋军被击溃，其皇室成员死亡或躲藏。

1279 年，大约 25 万人乘坐超过 1000 艘远洋船只，在现代中国崖山附近的一个偏远海湾停泊, 进行最后的抵抗. 几天之内，宋家的淡水就用完了。宋人士气崩溃，大多数人跳海自杀。(1279年,南宋灭亡)

== 蒙古 -> 征服伊斯兰

Around 1218, Chinggis Khan sent a caravan to the leader of Khwarazmia, Allah al- Din Muhammad, with a letter requesting the establishment of trade relations.

In a grave miscalculation, Allah al-Din Muhammad killed most of the emissaries Chinggis Khan sent to demand compensation, which meant war for Chinggis Khan. This included the decimation of the cities of Herat, Merv, and Nishapur, which for centuries had been three of the most important and prominent cities of the eastern Islamic world.

1218 年左右，成吉思汗派遣了一支商队, 去见"花剌子模"领袖安拉丁·穆罕默德，并附上一封信，请求建立贸易关系.

由于严重误判，安拉丁·穆罕默德杀死了成吉思汗派去要求赔偿的大部分使者. 这对成吉思汗意味着战争, 其中包括对赫拉特、梅尔夫, 和尼沙布尔等城市的摧毁，这些城市几个世纪以来一直是东部伊斯兰世界最重要和最著名的三个城市。

==  蒙古四个汗国的结局

The Four Khanates of the Mongol Empire. This map shows the areas ruled by the four Mongol khanates after the death of Kublai Khan in 1294. For all intents and purposes, these were separate sovereign states.

蒙古帝国的四个汗国。该地图显示了 1294 年忽必烈汗去世后, 四个蒙古汗国统治的地区。无论从何种角度和目的来看，这些汗国都是独立的主权国家。

image:/img/0027.jpg[,100%]

The rulers of three of the four khanates eventually converted to Islam along with many of their people.

Mongols living in the Il-Khanate had already begun intermarrying with their Muslim subjects. As they gradually became less culturally distinct from them, the Mongols increasingly became part of the sedentary societies they conquered and eventually abandoned their role as military conquerors.

四个汗国中的三个汗国的统治者, 最终和他们的许多人民一起皈依了伊斯兰教.

居住在伊尔汗国的蒙古人, 已经开始与他们的穆斯林臣民通婚，但随着他们在文化上与穆斯林臣民的差异逐渐缩小, 蒙古人现在越来越多地成为他们所征服的定居社会的一部分，并最终放弃了军事征服者的角色。(蒙古人和当地人混血后, 在文化上和人种上就逐渐被穆斯林同化了)

In 1368, the Yuan dynasty officially came to an end.

1368年，元朝正式灭亡。

== 帖木儿 (1336－1405年)

Timur was a Mongol from the Barlas tribe. He was born in central Asia, in a part of the Chagatai Khanate (now modern Uzbekistan), in the 1320s or 1330s.

Timur sought to rebuild the empire that Chinggis Khan had controlled at the time of his death. Because he could not establish descent from Chinggis, he could not claim the title of khan himself. In the 1360s, he gained control of part of the Chagatai Khanate.

Timur soon looked beyond central Asia for lands to control. He taxed the inhabitants of vanquished cities heavily. Cities that did not submit were treated brutally, however.

帖木儿 (1336－1405年)是巴拉斯部落的蒙古人，他于 1320 或 1330 年代出生于中亚"察合台汗 国"（现乌兹别克斯坦）的一部分。

帖木儿寻求重建成吉思汗死时所控制的帝国。因为他无法证明自己是成吉思汗的后裔，所以他自己也 不能自称为"可汗"。1360年代，他控制了"察合台汗国"的部分地区.

帖木儿很快就将目光投向中亚以外的地区，寻找可以控制的土地。他向被征服城市的居民征收重税，不服从的城市受到了残酷的对待.

Bayezid I had been steadily conquering weaker rulers in Anatolia and forcing them to become his vassals. However, Turkish tribes and Ottoman vassals who Bayezid I believed owed allegiance to him turned to Timur, considering him their means of achieving independence from Ottoman rule. In turn, enemies of Timur turned to Bayezid for assistance. Timur wrote to Bayezid, demanding that the Ottoman ruler cease aiding his enemies.

In 1400, Timur struck back. He then went on to wage war against the Mamluk sultans in Egypt in Syria, preventing Bayezid from turning to them for help. He also entered into an allegiance with the Byzantines against the Ottomans.

(奥斯曼帝国的)巴耶济德一世, 一直在稳步征服"安纳托利亚"中较弱的统治者，并迫使他们成为他的附庸。然而，巴耶济德一世认为效忠他的土耳其部落和奥斯曼封臣, 不愿屈服于他的统治，后者们转向帖木儿，认为能借助帖木儿来帮他们摆脱奥斯曼的统治。反过来，帖木儿的敌人，则在向巴耶济德寻求援助 (两边形成了类似联盟的状态)。帖木儿写信给巴耶济德，要求奥斯曼统治者停止援助帖木儿的敌人。

帖木儿发起反击，他继续在叙利亚, 对埃及的马穆鲁克苏丹发动战争，阻止巴耶济德向他们寻求帮助。他还与拜占庭人结盟，对抗奥斯曼人.

One of the great weaknesses of Bayezid’s Ottoman state was revealed. The Ottomans had built their empire in Anatolia by conquering other Turkish states and absorbing their rulers and the rulers’ descendants into their administration. These men, Bayezid’s unwilling vassals, had no wish to risk their lives for their Ottoman overlords. When Timur’s forces attacked at Ankara, therefore, many of Bayezid’s Turkish vassals abandoned the field, happy to be free of Ottoman control.

巴耶济德的奥斯曼帝国的一大弱点被暴露出来。奥斯曼帝国通过征服其他土耳其国家, 并将其统治者及其后裔吸收到他们的管理中,在安纳托利亚建立了他们的帝国.这些人是巴耶济德不情愿的封臣，他们不想为奥斯曼帝国的宗主买命。因此，当帖木儿的军队进攻安卡拉时，许多巴耶济德的土耳其封臣, 放弃了战场，很高兴摆脱了奥斯曼帝国的控制。奥斯曼帝国因此被击败.

Following his rout of the Ottomans and having conquered most of the domains of Chinggis Khan and his sons and grandsons, Timur turned eastward to claim his last prize—China. In 1368, the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China had come to an end. In December 1404, Timur set out to cross central Asia on his way to China. Within a few months, however, he fell ill, and in February 1405 he died. The invasion of China ended before it had begun.

在击败奥斯曼帝国, 并征服成吉思汗及其子孙的大部分领土后，帖木儿转向东方，夺取他最后的战利品 ——中国。 1368年，中国的蒙古元朝结束了。1404年 12月，帖木儿出发, 穿越中亚前往中国。然而几个月后，他病倒了，并于 1405 年 2 月去世。对中国的入侵还没开始就结束了.

At the time of his death, Timur had conquered much of the land claimed in the original Mongol conquests of Chinggis Khan and his descendants. Unlike them, however, Timur made no real effort to rule the places he seized outside Persia. Thus, it was relatively easy for most places that Timur had conquered to regain their independence.

帖木儿去世时，已经征服了成吉思汗及其后裔最初蒙古征服时, 所声称拥有的大部分土地。然而，与他 们不同的是，帖木儿并没有真正努力统治他在波斯以外夺取的土地。因此，对于帖木儿征服的大多数地方来说，恢复独立是相对容易的。

The Timurid Empire. By the time of Timur’s death in 1405, his empire stretched from the border of Anatolia in the west to northern India in the east, and from modern Uzbekistan in the north to the Gulf of Hormuz in the south.

帖木儿帝国。到1405年帖木儿去世时，他的帝国西起安纳托利亚边境，东至印度北部，北起现代乌兹别克斯坦，南至霍尔木兹湾。
