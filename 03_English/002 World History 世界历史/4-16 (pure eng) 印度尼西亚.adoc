Indonesia assumed a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement. It was a country with a large population, oil deposits, and a strategically advantageous geographical position.

Both the United States and the Soviet Union desired Indonesia as an ally.  Both sides believed Indonesia’s future path—communist or democratic—would greatly influence the other nations of Asia. Accordingly, both courted Sukarno, and Sukarno accepted aid from both. In his eyes, so long as he did not allow either superpower to determine Indonesia’s affairs, his country was neutral.



By 1964 Sukarno had abandoned all pretense of neutrality and sought alliances with communist countries while encouraging anti–United States sentiment in Indonesia.

In 1965, Suharto, a general in the Indonesian military, claimed that Indonesian communists had sought to subvert the government by plotting to kill Sukarno. Suharto’s subsequent destruction of Indonesia’s communists, carried out with the aid of the CIA, may have cost the lives of some one million people.

In 1967, Suharto removed Sukarno from office and assumed dictatorial powers.
