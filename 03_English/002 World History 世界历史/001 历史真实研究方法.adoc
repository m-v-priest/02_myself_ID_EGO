=== 什么是历史?

What is history?

- It is the historian’s task to paint as clear a picture as sources will allow.

历史学家的任务是在资料来源允许的情况下描绘出尽可能清晰的图景。

The bottom line is that interpretation plays a central role in the field of history. The danger lies in using only one lens. Yes, historians choose some causes as more important than others, but only after considering all the information available.

最重要的是，解释在历史领域发挥着核心作用。危险在于只使用一个镜头。是的，历史学家会选择某些原因比其他原因更重 要，但前提是考虑了所有可用信息。

=== 关于历史资料



==== 一手资料, 和二手资料

There are two main kinds of historical sources, primary and secondary.

历史来源主要有两种：一手的和二手的。

Primary sources, when we have them, are considered more valuable than other sources because they are as close in time as we can get to the events being studied. Think, for example, of a court trial: The ideal is to have the trial quickly so that witness testimony is fresher and therefore more reliable. With the passage of time, people can forget, they might subconsciously add or take away parts of a memory, and they may be influenced to interpret events differently.

主要来源是通往过去的门户，因为它是直接来自它所指的时 间段的对象或文档。主要来源可能是政府文件、餐馆菜单、日记、信件等。当我们拥有主要来源时，它们被认为比其他来源更有价值，因为它们与我们所研究的 事件的时间尽可能接近。以法庭审判为例：理想的情况是迅速进行审判，以便证人的证词更新鲜，因 此更可靠。随着时间的流逝，人们可能会忘记，他们可能会下意识地添加或删除部分记忆，并且可能 会受到影响以不同的方式解释事件。

A secondary source is one written or created after the fact. Good research requires both types of sources and some attention to historiography, which is the study of how other historians have already interpreted and written about the past.

二手资料是事后编写或创建的资料。好的研究需要两种类型的资料来源和对史学的关注，史学是对其他历史学家如何解释和书写过 去的研究。

==== 文字资料更有价值

History technically begins with the advent of writing. For historians, the written word is more accurate evidence for building narratives of the past. For example, imagine a modern magazine with a rock or pop star on the front, dressed for performance in a vibrant or provocative style. If that were the only piece of evidence that existed five hundred years from now, how would historians interpret our era? Without context, interpretation of the past is quite difficult. Studying artifacts is certainly worthwhile, but text offers us greater clarity. Even if the cover of the magazine bore only a caption, like “Pop star rising to the top of the charts,” future historians would have significantly more information than from the photo alone.

从技术上讲，历史始于文字的出现. 对于历史学家来说，书面文字是构建过去叙 事的更准确的证据。例如，想象一本现代杂志，封面上有一位摇滚或流行歌星，穿着充满活力或挑衅 风格的表演服装。如果这是五百年后唯一存在的证据，历史学家将如何解释我们的时代？没有背景， 解释过去是相当困难的。研究文物当然是值得的，但文本可以让我们更加清晰。即使杂志的封面上只 有一个标题，比如“流行歌星登上排行榜榜首”，未来的历史学家也将比仅从照片中获得更多的信息。

==== 评估"信息来源"的可靠性

Historians evaluate the strength of both primary and secondary sources, especially online. How do we decide what a good source is? Always make sure you can tell who is producing the website. Is it a scholar, a museum, or a research organization?

历史学家评估主要和次要来源的强度，尤其是在线来源。我们如何 确定什么是好的来源？始终确保您知道谁在制作该网站。是学者、博物馆还是研究机构？


- Does the source tell you where it got the information?

消息来源是否告诉您从哪里获得信息？

-  Are those sources in turn objective and reliable?

这些来源又客观又可 靠吗？

-  Can you corroborate the site’s information?  You should see whether other sources present similar data.

您能证实该网站的信息吗？您应该看看其他来源是否提供了类 似的数据

=== ★★ 如何分析历史资料? 需要考虑4个方面: ①作者的身份立场, ②作者是说或写给谁看的? ③ 作者这样说或写的目的是什么? ④ 作者在做这件事时的环境背景是什么?


Consider the act of reading a poem. You can read the surface of a poem, the literal meaning of the words presented. But that seldom reflects the true meaning the poet meant to convey. You must also look for nuances, hidden meanings, or repeated metaphors. We approach a primary source in a similar way.

考虑读一首诗的行为。你可以阅读一首诗的表 面，即所呈现单词的字面意思。但这很少反映诗人想要传达的真正含义。你还必须寻找细微差别、隐 藏的含义或重复的隐喻。我们以类似的方式接近主要来源。



There are four key areas to consider when interpreting sources: the author, the audience, the intent, and the context.  A deeper inspection might reveal hidden motives. Most text-based sources have meanings beyond the obvious, and it is the historian’s job to uncover these.

解释来源时需要考虑四个关键领域：作者、受众、意图和上下文。更深入的检查可能会揭示隐 藏的动机。大多数基于文本的资料都具 有超出显而易见的意义，历史学家的工作就是揭示这些意义。

|①作者的身份立场是什么, 作者是谁?
|- What kind of source is it? Government documents have a different purpose than personal diaries. A former president commenting on a political issue has a different view from a comedian doing the same.

它是什么样的来源？政府文件与个人日记的用途不同。前总统对政治问题的评论与喜剧演员的观 点不同。

- Who authored the source and why?

来源的作者是谁以及为什么？

- 作者是否只负责记录信息，或者作者是否参与了该事件？

Is the author responsible for simply recording the information, or was the author involved in the event?

|②作者是说或写给谁看的?
|
-  For whom was it written?

它是为谁编写的？

-  Was it meant to be public or private? Is it a letter to a friend or an essay submitted for publication?

它是公开的还是私人的？ 是一封写给朋友的信还是 一篇提交发表的文章？

|③ 作者这样说或写的目的是什么?
|- You should think about the intent:   Is the author reliable, or does the author have an agenda?

您还应该考虑意图: 作者是否 可靠，或者作者是否有目的？

-  Why might the author have written what they did? Why was the document written? Was it intended to be a factual account of an event? Was it meant to persuade?  Could the writer have been fending off an attack or lobbying for one?

为什么作者会写 出他们所做的事情？为什么要编写该文档？它的目的是对一个事件进行事实性的 描述吗？是为了劝说吗？作者可能是在抵御攻击或游说攻 击吗？

-  Is it a complete falsification? Often people write things that present them in the best light rather than reveal weaknesses.

这是完全的伪造吗？ 通常，人们写的东西都是以最好的方式展示自己，而不 是揭露弱点。


The exterior of Hagia Sophia was decorated with Greek iconography. Churches at the time were meant to inspire awe; because most people could not read, stories of religious figures and events were told through highly decorative and symbolic images. Obedience and a desire to join a religious community could be motivated by the buildings’ grandeur.

As you study the renderings, reflect on the following questions: What are the key features of the building? What does it make you think about? What would you think about it if you were a poor sixth-century farmer, an urban merchant of some wealth, or a foreign leader?

圣索菲亚大教堂的外墙装饰着希腊的圣像。当时的教堂是用来激发敬畏之心的;因为大多数人不识字，所以宗教人物和事件的故事都是通过高度装饰性和象征性的图像来讲述的。建筑物的宏伟可以激发服从和加入宗教团体的愿望。当 您研究效果图时，请思考以下问题：建筑物的主要特征是什么？它让你想到什么？如果你是一个六世纪的贫穷农民，一个有一定财富的城市商人，或者一个外国 领导人，你会怎么想？


The different types of language used in a source are clues to its interpretation. Linguists call the use of language rhetoric. Rhetorical choices, decisions about the way words are used and put together, are often deliberate and intended to achieve a certain outcome.

来源中使用的不同类型的语言是其解释的线索。语言学家将语言的运用称为修辞。修辞选择，即关于 词语使用和组合方式的决定，通常是经过深思熟虑的，旨在实现某种结果。

President Franklin D. Roosevelt went to Congress and asked for a declaration of war against Japan. The speech he gave, however, was about more than this request. Roosevelt used certain words to highlight that the attack was secret and calculated. He also suggested that God was on the side of the United States. As you read, pay special attention to the words Roosevelt uses. Can you pick out a few key rhetorical choices?

富兰克林·罗斯福总统前往国会要求对日本宣战。然而，他发表的讲话不仅仅涉及这 一要求。罗斯福使用了某些词语来强调这次袭击是秘密的、经过精心策划的。他还表示上帝 站在美国一边。当你阅读时，请特别注意罗斯福使用的词语。你能选出一些关键的修辞选择 吗？


|④ 作者在做这件事时的环境背景是什么?
|- What is the historical context?  What is the general time period of the document, and what was that time like?  Is it a time of war or peace? Is there religious conflict? Is there an economic crisis? A health crisis? A natural disaster?

历史背景是什么？该文档的大致时间段是多少？那段 时间是什么样的？现在是战争时期还 是和平时期？有宗教冲突吗？有经济危机吗？健康危机？自然灾害？

-  What was happening when the individual wrote the document? Was there any sort of intimidation or distress? Are we missing other perspectives or voices we would like to hear?

当个人撰写该文档时发生了什么？有没有受到任何恐吓或困扰？我们是否错过了我们想听到的其他观点或声音？

- How does the source relate to the events covered in the chapter?

来源与本章中涵盖的事件有何关系？

=== 寻找"因果关系"的方法

Causation and Interpretation in History

历史上的因果关系和解释


Not all causes are equally significant; we need to rank them in importance. Which causes had the most influence on you, and which were more remote?

并非所有原因都同样重 要；我们需要对它们的重要性进行排名。哪些原因对您影响最大，哪些影响较小？


In 1453, Mehmed II laid siege to the city of Constantinople. Why? Mehmed II was the leader of the Ottoman Empire, the sultan. He had been badly treated by his father, and when he ascended the throne, he felt he had something to prove. The Ottomans had tried several times to take Constantinople because it lay at the crossroads of many civilizations. Conquest had long been a reliable mechanism for bringing new people and wealth into the Ottoman Empire and for keeping its economy prosperous. All these factors played a role in the siege undertaken by Mehmed II. Can you order them by importance?

This is the point where historians usually disagree, even about events for which most of the facts are clear. A historian who believes powerful leaders are the most influential factor driving events would rank Mehmed’s personal goals first. Base your ranking on the strongest arguments you can make.

1453年，穆罕默德二世围攻君士坦丁堡城。为什么？穆罕默德二世是奥斯曼帝国 的领袖、苏丹。他曾受到父亲的虐待，当他登上王位时，他觉得自己有必要证明一些事情。奥斯曼帝 国曾多次试图占领君士坦丁堡，因为它位于许多文明的十字路口。长期以来，征服一直是为奥斯曼帝 国带来新人口和财富并保持其经济繁荣的可靠机制。所有这些因素都在穆罕默德二世的围攻中发挥了 作用。你能按重要性排序吗？

这是历史学家通常意见不一致的一点，即使对于大多数事实已经明确的 事件也是如此。一位历史学家认为强大的领导人是推动事件发生的最有影响力的因素，他会将穆罕默 德的个人目标排在第一位。您的排名基于您能提出的最有力的论据。

=== 历史研究的局限

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 我们无法知道所有历史事实
|Will history ever be a perfect telling of the human tale? No. There are voices we may never hear.

历史会完美地讲述人类的故事吗？不。有些声音我们可能永远听不到。



|-> 不同当事人的认知可能不同, 回忆也可能有扭曲
|You will engage with firsthand accounts of key people and events — including instances in which people’s recollections of the same events might differ.

您将接触关键人物和事件的第一手资料，包括人们对同一事件 的回忆可能不同的情况。

|-> 古代地图的编制, 也是带有当事人的主观倾向的.
|During the Age of Exploration, the Pope arbitrarily divided inhabited territory that was new to Europeans and granted it to Spain and Portugal.

地图是 我们拥有的最有争议的历史证据之一，因为它们几乎总是从制作地图的人的角度制作的，而不是作为 一种客观实践。

Maps are some of the most contested pieces of historical evidence we have because they were almost always made from the perspective of the one making the map, not as an objective practice.

大航海时代，教皇任意划分欧洲人陌生的居住领土，将其赐给西班牙和葡萄牙。

=== 了解历史, 能带给我们什么利益? (以史为鉴)

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 了解我们为什么是现在这个样子
|It is a path to knowing why we are the way we are — all our greatness, all our faults — and therefore a means for us to understand ourselves and change for the better. But history serves this function only if it is a true reflection of the past. It cannot be a way to mask the darker parts of human nature, nor a way to justify acts of previous generations.

[.my2]
它是一条了解我们为什么是现在这个样子的途径——我们所有的伟大，我们所有的缺点——因此也是我们了解自己并变得更好的一种手段。但历史只有真实反映过去才能发挥这一作用。它不能成为掩盖人性阴暗部分的方法，也不能成为为前几代人的行为辩护的方法。

|-> 提升你的"批判性思维"和"分析能力"
|The study of history will also enhance your critical-thinking and analytical ability. +
Other skills that have become increasingly important include adaptive thinking, social intelligence, cross-cultural competency, and media literacy.



历史研究还将增强你的批判性思维和分析能力. +
其他变得越来越重要的技能包括适应性思维、社交智力、跨文化能力和媒体素养。


|-> 吸取前人的教训
|“Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” Yet because history is an everchanging collection of events influenced and shaped by a variety of causes and outcomes, it never truly repeats at all.

“不从历史中吸取教训的人注定会重蹈覆辙。”然而，由于历史是由各种原因和结果影响和塑造的不断变化的事件的集合，因此它永远不会真正重复。

|-> 令你能保持思想的开放性, 而不思维局限或极端
|It also hones a creative mindset that is flexible and open to interpretations and ideas outside our own worldview.

它还磨练了一种灵活的创造性思维，对我们自己的世界观之外的解释和想法持开放态度。


|-> 了解世界多元化的文化, 让你能更好的成为全球公民的身份
|In our workplaces, in our world, we are a diverse people. Learning how to respect, communicate and collaborate with an increasingly diverse work culture is crucial to optimizing a company’s efficiency and productivity. Knowing about the world will prepare you to be a global citizen.

在我们的工作场所、我们的世界中，我们是一群多元化的人。学习如何在日益多元化的工作文化中尊重、沟通和协作对于优化(你创办的)公司的效率和生产力至关重要。了解世界将使你做好成为一名全球公民的准备.

|-> 培养讲"能吸引人"故事的能力
|Historians must also be effective communicators. Who cares about a story nobody reads or a product nobody buys?

历史学家还必须是有效的沟通者。谁会关心没人读的故事或没人买的产品？
|===


'''

=== 对古人的历史同理心


The practice of historical empathy is the ability to meet the past on its own terms, without judgment or the imposition of our modern-day attitudes. Everyone has a set of biases; historians must investigate these biases and understand how they affect their interpretations. It is not the historian’s job to pass judgment on the past, but to present it as clearly as possible and to preserve that clarity for future generations. This may mean reflecting impartially on historical positions, attitudes, or decisions we might find abhorrent when viewed from today’s world.

历史同理心的实践，即以过去的方式来 面对过去的能力，而不用评判或强加我们自己的现代态度。每个人都有一系列偏见，历史学家必须调查这些偏见并了解它们如何影响他们的解释。历史学家 的工作不是对过去做出判断，而是尽可能清晰地呈现过去，并为后代保留这种清晰度。这可能意味着 公正地反思从当今世界来看我们可能会觉得令人憎恶的历史立场、态度或决定。(即不能用现代人的价值观, 来强求古人.)

=== 对历史看法的思想流派

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 进步史学
|One of the early European schools of thought was progressive history, which viewed history as a straight line to a specific destination. Historians with this “progressive” view believed societies were becoming more democratic over time. Their perspective might also be considered a form of teleological history, which proposes that history is moving to a particular end. Progressive historians believed in the betterment of people and of society, so long as it occurred on a European model. Progress looked only one way: the Western way.

欧洲早期的思想流派之一是进步历史学，它将历史视为通往特 定目的地的直线。持有这种“进步”观点的历史学家认为，随着时间的推移，社会变得更加民主. 他们的观点也可能被认为是目的论历史的一种形式，它提出历史正在走向一 个特定的终点. 进步历史学家相信人民和社会会变得更好，只要它是按照欧洲模 式发生的。进步看起来只有一种方式：西方方式。

|-> 当代思想史
|
In the twentieth century, particularly after World War I, the idea of inevitable human progress seemed laughable. People grew more willing to question the authority of elites. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the psychology behind people’s choices. This is one reason for the rise of contemporary intellectual history, which looks at the ideas that drive people to make certain choices and focuses on philosophical questions and the history of human thought.

在二十世纪，特别是第一次世界大战之后，人类不可避免地进步的想法似乎很可笑。人们越来越愿意 质疑精英的权威. 历史学家对人类状况的非理性 方面以及人们选择背后的心理变得更加感兴趣。这是当代思想史兴起的原因之一，它着眼于驱使人们 做出某些选择的思想，并关注哲学问题和人类思想史。

Our belief systems are informed by social constructs, ideas that have been created and accepted by the people in a society, such as the concepts of class distinction and gender. Social constructs influence the ways people think and behave.

我们的信仰体系是由社会建构、社会中人们创造和接受的观念（例如阶级概念）决定的。区 别和性别。社会结构影响人们的思维和行为方式。



To understand history, you must understand the social construction of reality, which is the way people define roles and perceive themselves within a social context. Consider our earlier thought exercise. You believe education is important. Why? Who has said that to you in the past? How did you come to believe it? In other words, what is your social construction of education, and where did it come from?

要理解历史，你必须理解现实的社会建构，这是人们在社会背景下定义角色和感知自己的方式。考虑 一下我们之前的思维练习。您认为教育很重要。为什么？过去谁对你说过这样的话？你怎么会相信它 呢？换句话说，你的教育的社会建构是什么？它从何而来？

Social constructs exist everywhere and inform many decisions we make, often on a subconscious level. For example, consider the following questions:

社会结构无处不在，并影响我们做出的许多决定，通常是在潜意识层面上。例如，考虑以下问题：

1.What do you buy a five-year-old girl for her birthday? What do you buy for a boy the same age? What influenced your decision?

给五岁小女孩买什么生日礼物？给同龄男孩买什么？是什么影响了你的决定？

2.What would you wear to a job interview? What would you wear to a party? Why? 你会穿什么去参加工作面试？你会穿什么去参加聚会？为什么？

3.To which person standing at the front of a classroom would you give more respect: a woman dressed in a tailored suit, or a man wearing jeans and a t-shirt? Why?

你会更尊重站在教室前面的哪个人：穿着定制西装的女士，还是穿着牛仔裤和 T 恤的男士？为什 么？

Trends in Historical Thought. Historians’ thinking has led from the progressive school of interpretation to the more contemporary fields of intellectual and social history.

历史思想的趋势。历史学家的思维已经从进步的解释流派引向了更为当代的思想史和社会史领域。

=== 人类在民权上的进步

Beginning in 1948, the United Nations (UN) established a series of universal declarations that conceived of all people as deserving of human rights and dignity (Figure 1.3). Three such declarations further affirmed the rights of women (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, also known as CEDAW, 1979), of children (The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959), and of people with disabilities (The Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, 1975). The UN regularly requires that member nations report on progress in these areas.

从 1948 年开始，联合国 (UN) 制定了一系列普遍宣言，认为所有人都应享有人权和尊严。三项这样的宣言进一步确 认了妇女的权利（《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》，，也称为《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》， 1979 年）、儿童的权利（《儿童权利宣言》，1959 年）和残疾人的权利（《残疾人权利宣言》， 1975 年）。联合国定期要求成员国报告这些领域的进展
