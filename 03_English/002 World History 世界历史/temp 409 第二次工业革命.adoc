U.S. banks, which realized the loans they had extended to the European Allies would go unpaid if Germany won, already supported their country’s involvement, as did businesses that hoped U.S. assistance would encourage the Allies to grant them greater access to global markets.

美国的银行意识 到，如果德国获胜，它们向欧洲盟国提供的贷款将无法偿还，因此已经支持美国的参与，希望美国的 援助能够鼓励盟国给予它们更多进入全球市场的机会的企业也是如此。

In April 1917, the United States entered the conflict on the side of the Allied powers.

1917 年 4 月，美国站在同盟国一边加入 了冲突。

The trenches of the western front, born of the stalemate in which the Allies and Central powers found themselves in the fall of 1914, became synonymous with the war.

1914 年秋，盟军和同盟国陷入僵局，西线的战壕成为战争的代名词。

It rained regularly, and the trenches became filled with mud. Constant moisture on feet and legs caused trench foot when the skin could not dry and began to split and come off.

经常下雨，战 壕里充满了泥土。当脚和腿上的皮肤无 法干燥并开始裂开和脱落时，脚和腿上的持续潮湿会导致战壕足

The ANZAC forces representing Australia and New Zealand saw heavy action in the Mediterranean in 1915. The idea behind the British plan was to launch a ship-based artillery attack at the Dardanelles and then land troops on a peninsula called Gallipoli. This would allow the British to link up with Russian forces and coordinate a push against the Turks to isolate the Ottoman Empire and seize control of the important Turkish straits leading to the Sea of Marmara (Figure 11.14). The brainchild of Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, the operation suffered problems from its start in February. The first ships took heavy fire and were crippled by mines. The Turks were prepared for a ground invasion and began firing on the Allied troops from secure positions. Those who made it ashore were unable to do more than establish beachheads and did not drive far into the interior. The situation continued through all of 1915 before the British decided to evacuate their troops. Casualties from both sides totaled approximately 900,000, losses commemorated in Australia and New Zealand each year on ANZAC Day, April 25. Churchill resigned over the debacle.

(各国的殖民地, 也被动员起来加入战争.) 1915年，代表澳大利亚和新西兰的澳新军团在地中海采取了大规模行动。英国计划背后的想法 是对达达尼尔海峡发动舰载炮击，然后在一个名为加利波利的半岛上登陆。这将使英国能够与俄罗斯 军队联合起来，协调打击土耳其人，孤立奥斯曼帝国，并夺取通往马尔马拉海的重要土耳其海峡的控 制权。该行动是时任第一海军大臣温斯顿·丘吉尔的创意，从二月份开始就遇到了问题。 第一批船只遭到猛烈火力攻击并被水雷损坏。土耳其人做好了地面入侵的准备，并开始从安全位置向 盟军开火。那些登上岸的人除了建立滩头阵地外什么也做不了，也没有深入内陆地区。这种情况持续 了整个 1915 年，直到英国决定撤离军队。双方伤亡总计约 90 万人，澳大利亚和新西兰每年都会在 4 月 25 日澳新军团日纪念损失。丘吉尔因这次惨败而辞职。

Prejudice and discrimination were widely evident within the major powers in the war. The multitude of nationalities that fought in this war meant that people were regularly engaging with allies from different backgrounds and ethnicities. The prospect of tension in these relationships was clear.

战争中的主要大国内部普遍存在偏见和歧视。。参加这场战争的民族众多，这意味着人们经常与 来自不同背景和种族的盟友接触。这些关系中紧张的前景是显而易见的。

Many national governments coped unsuccessfully with financing the war. Generally, less than a third of the cost was paid through taxation. Instead, borrowing by selling war bonds to the public, printing more money, and taking on more debt became the main method of paying for the war. Price inflation hit new highs as the combination of debt, the printing of money, and product shortages squeezed civilian budgets.

许多国家政府未能成功地为战争提供资金。一般来说，不到三分之一的成本是通过税收支付的。相 反，通过向公众出售战争债券来借贷、印更多的钱、承担更多的债务成为支付战争费用的主要方法。 由于债务、印钞和产品短缺挤压了民间预算，物价通胀创下新高。(钱多物少，肯定通胀)

As the British army found itself in need of more troops, it began active recruitment campaigns. One popular tactic tried in the first half of the war was the development of “pals” units. Young men would sign up together and be guaranteed assignment to the same unit, a unit of their pals. While certainly an enticement to serve, this method of organizing units also meant that neighborhoods and villages might see nearly all their young men wounded or killed in the same engagement. The practice was discontinued after the high-casualty Somme campaign in 1916.

当英国军队发现自己需要更多的军队时，它开始积极的招募活动。战争前半段尝试的一种流行策略是 发展“伙伴”部队。年轻人会一起报名，并保证被分配到同一个单位，即他们朋友的单位。虽然这无疑是 一种服役的诱惑，但这种组织部队的方法也意味着社区和村庄可能会看到几乎所有的年轻人在同一次 战斗中受伤或死亡。 1916 年伤亡惨重的索姆河战役后，这种做法就停止了。

As more men set off to fight, women in many countries found job opportunities in traditionally male-oriented fields.

越来越多的男性参战，许多国家的女性在传统上以男性为主的领域找到了工作机 会

The sense of independence and the novelty of making their own money spurred many women involved in the war effort to see political reform and voting rights as the next step. For example, many women in Britain viewed the extension of voting rights as a way to reward them for their war work. Suffragists had been protesting for years about the need to include women among the voting population in numerous countries such as Britain, Germany, and the United States. In 1918, Britain extended the right to vote to property-owning women over thirty. Germany gave women the vote in 1918, the first country to grant universal adult female suffrage, as did the United States in 1920.

独立感和自己赚钱的新鲜感促使许多参与战争的女性将政治改革和投票权视为下一步。例如，许多英 国女性将投票权的扩大视为奖励她们战争工作的一种方式。在英国、德国和美国等许多国家，妇女参 政论者多年来一直抗议将女性纳入投票人口的必要性。 1918年，英国将投票权扩大到30岁以上的有产 女性。德国于 1918 年赋予妇女选举权，是第一个给予成年女性普选权的国家，美国于 1920 年也是如 此。

Britain was particularly vulnerable to shortages because it imported approximately 60 percent of its food.

英国特别容易受到短缺的影响，因为大约 60% 的食品依赖进口。

Civilian discontent also rose as more young men were needed for the armies. The war dragged on, and the early enthusiasm evidenced by young recruits in 1914 disappeared. Some recruits did not have confidence that the national armies would be able to win battles or that it was worth risking their lives in service. Other young men were conscientious objectors who for religious and philosophical reasons did not believe in fighting wars and therefore did not wish to serve. Some would-be soldiers in the empires increasingly questioned the value of fighting for imperial glory.

随着军队需要更多的年轻人，平民的不满情绪也随之上升。战争一拖再拖，1914 年年轻新兵的早期热 情消失了。一些新兵不相信国家军队能够赢得战斗，也不相信值得冒着生命危险服役。其他年轻人是 出于良心拒服兵役的人，他们出于宗教和哲学原因不相信打仗，因此不想服役。一些想要成为帝国士 兵的人越来越质疑为帝国荣耀而战的价值。

The use of censorship became a common tool to manage civilian discontent by limiting the information distributed about the war effort. Newspapers presented only vague descriptions of battles and losses, and government-sponsored propaganda showed civilians pro-war posters and commentary. Censorship efforts began in all combatant nations in 1914 and expanded to the United States when it entered in the war in 1917.

审查制度的使用成为通过限制有关战争努力的信息传播来管理平民不满情绪的常用工具。报纸仅对战 斗和损失进行模糊描述，政府资助的宣传则向平民展示支持战争的海报和评论。审查制度于 1914 年开 始在所有交战国进行，并在 1917 年美国参战时扩大到美国。

The U.S. government’s effort to squash criticism of the war began in 1917 with the Espionage Act. It set limits on what could be mailed, banning any type of anti-war newspaper or pamphlet. In 1918, Congress passed the Sedition Act. This forbade “disloyal, profane, scurrilous, and abusive” language about the decision to enter the war, the draft, the flag, and armed forces’ uniforms. It was not about what might be true, but about what could be seen as disloyal. Anti-war speech was considered disloyal and therefore seditious. People were unable to openly question why the United States was in the war or speak out against it without risking imprisonment or hefty fines. Today we see the Sedition Act as a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which promises protections for free speech. Despite this, the Supreme Court upheld the act.

美国政府于 1917 年通过《间谍法》开始努力压制对战争的批评。它对邮寄物品进行了限制，禁止任何 类型的反战报纸或小册子。 1918年，国会通过了《煽动叛乱法》 。该法案禁止在参战决定、征兵、国 旗和武装部队制服方面使用“不忠诚、亵渎、粗俗和辱骂”的语言。这不是关于什么可能是真实的，而是 关于什么可能被视为不忠诚。反战言论被认为是不忠诚的，因此具有煽动性。人们无法公开质疑美国 为何卷入战争，也无法公开反对战争，否则就会面临监禁或巨额罚款的风险。今天，我们认为《煽动 叛乱法》违反了美国宪法第一修正案，该修正案承诺保护言论自由。尽管如此，最高法院还是维持了 该法案.

Poets published work that put the inhumanity and suffering of the war on full display. No heroic charges were celebrated in their stanzas.

诗人的作品充分展现了战争的不人道和苦难。他们的诗节中没有 庆祝英雄的冲锋。

Due to the use of aircraft in the war, civilians in Europe also had the experience of being displaced from their own cities. Those who survived the destruction of their homes became refugees in their own country.

由于战争中飞机的使用，欧洲的平民也有过逃离自己城市的经历。那些在家园被毁后幸存下来的人成为了自己国家的难民。

Refugees emerged all over Europe. By the end of 1914, more than three million people in France and Belgium alone had left their homes. While many were eventually able to return, the problem of housing millions of displaced people continued throughout the war. On the eastern front, Jewish citizens fled their homes by the tens of thousands, and many found themselves further east in Russia than had previously been allowed due to anti-Semitic laws.

欧洲各地出现了难民。到 1914 年底，仅法国和比利时就有超过 300 万人离开家园。虽然许多人最终得 以返回，但数百万流离失所者的住房问题在整个战争期间持续存在。在东部战线，数以万计的犹太公 民逃离家园，许多人发现自己身处俄罗斯，比之前反犹太法所允许的地方更远。

On January 5, 1905, many workers gathered to protest peacefully outside Tsar Nicholas II’s Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. They were led by a local cleric and appealed to the tsar (who was not in residence) for improvements to their working conditions, as well as a government that would share power with a popularly elected assembly.

1905年1月5日，许多工人聚集在圣彼得堡沙皇尼古拉二世冬宫外进行和平抗议。他们由当地一名神职 人员领导，呼吁沙皇（当时不在居住地）改善他们的工作条件，并呼吁建立一个与民选议会分享权力 的政府。

Workers in numerous cities went on strike to protest the bloodshed as part of the Revolution of 1905. Many strikes turned violent as more troops were ordered to put them down. With no end in sight, Nicholas II was forced to concede that he would no longer rule autocratically, and that a national legislature would meet to create a new voice in the government. The legislature was called the Duma and first met in 1906. It was composed of middleclass men and peasants, but it had two houses. One was indirectly chosen by an electoral college whose members were selected by men over age twenty-five. The other house had members appointed by the tsar. This second house dominated the Duma, limiting the legislature’s ability to function as a true representative assembly. While it was a step forward in line with some revolutionary aims, it did not signal a true sharing of power by the tsar.

作为 1905 年革命的一部分，许多城市的工人举行罢工，抗议流血事件。 许多罢工演变为暴力，因为更多的军队被命令镇压。由于看不到尽头，尼古拉二世被迫承认他将不再 实行独裁统治，国家立法机构将开会在政府中发出新的声音。立法机关称为杜马，于 1906 年首次召 开。它由中产阶级男子和农民组成，但有两院。其中一名是由选举团间接选出的，选举团成员由二十 五岁以上的男性选出。另一院的成员由沙皇任命。第二议院主导了杜马，限制了立法机关作为真正的 代表议会发挥作用的能力。虽然这是符合某些革命目标的一步，但这并不意味着沙皇真正分享权力。

The soldiers formed the Petrograd Soviet (a council representing workers, soldiers, and peasants) to establish power in the city. A group of moderate politicians then established a new government for Russia under the auspices of the Duma. This provisional government was led by Alexander Kerensky, a lawyer who had become popular for assisting revolutionaries in the past. Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate, paving the way for the end of three hundred years of Romanov rule.

士兵们组建了彼得格勒苏维埃（代表工人、士兵和农民的委员会）以在该市建立政权。随后，一群温 和派政治家在杜马的主持下成立了俄罗斯新政府。这个临时政府由亚历山大·克伦斯基（Alexander Kerensky）领导，他是一位过去因协助革命者而广受欢迎的律师。沙皇尼古拉二世被迫退位，为罗曼 诺夫三百年统治的结束铺平了道路。

Kerensky was dedicated to continuing Russia’s participation in World War I, partly because he feared that aid he needed from the West to support Russia’s economy would be lost if he withdrew from the conflict. However, this position became increasingly unpopular with the Russian people. The provisional government and the Petrograd Soviet (which was becoming more anti-war) then vied for power in Russia.

克伦斯基致力于让俄罗斯继续参与第一次世界大战，部分原因是他担心，如果他退出冲突，他将失去 西方支持俄罗斯经济所需的援助。然而，这一立场越来越不受俄罗斯人民的欢迎。随后，临时政府和 彼得格勒苏维埃（变得更加反战）争夺俄罗斯的权力。

Germany saw an opportunity to take advantage of Russia’s disintegrating political situation. A young Russian named Vladimir Ilyich Lenin had supported the cause of revolution in his native country for many years. Lenin had then left Russia, branded a radical and forced into exile. Germany helped him return to Russia to energize the revolution there and undermine the tsarist government’s conduct of the war.

德国看到了利用俄罗斯分崩离析的政治局势的机会(德国最好希望俄罗斯退出与自己的战争呢)。。一位名叫弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的俄罗斯青年多 年来一直支持祖国的革命事业。随后 列宁离开俄罗斯，被贴上激进分子的标签并被迫流亡。德国帮助他回到俄罗斯，激发那里的革命并破 坏沙皇政府的战争行为。

Lenin quickly became the leader of the revolutionary cause, and the group he led, the Bolsheviks, challenged Kerensky’s provisional government. In the October Revolution in 1917, Lenin led a coup and seized power from the other political factions in Petrograd.

Capitalizing on a campaign of “Peace, Land, Bread,” Lenin’s government moved to end the war with Germany. Germany was only too happy to work out an agreement that would allow it to focus solely on the war on its western front.

列宁很快成为革命事业的领袖，他领导的布尔什维克集团向克伦斯基的 临时政府发起挑战。 1917年十月革命，列宁领导政变，从彼得格勒其他政治派别手中夺取了政权。列宁政府利用“和平、土地、面包”运动结束了与德国的战争。 德国非常高兴能够达成一项协议，使其能够专注于西部战线的战争。

Lenin’s goal was to end the fighting as quickly as possible, so he agreed to terms that were fairly advantageous for Germany and the Central powers. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on March 3, 1918. In it, Russia gave up significant territory to the Central powers, including areas of Poland and Ukraine, Finland, and the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia), which gave Germany new ports. In return, Russia was able to end its participation in the war as Lenin focused on building a Communist state, the Soviet Union.

列宁的目标是尽快结束战斗，因此他同意了对德国和同盟国相当有利的条件。 1918 年 3 月 3 日签署了 《布列斯特-立托夫斯克条约》。在该条约中，俄罗斯将大片领土让给同盟国，包括波兰和乌克兰、芬 兰以及波罗的海国家（立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚）的地区。给了德国新的港口。作为 回报，俄罗斯得以结束对战争的参与，因为列宁专注于建设共产主义国家苏联。

In 1918, after being held under house arrest for two years, the former tsar, his wife, and their five children were executed. A civil war broke out that year pitting the White Army, which opposed Lenin, against the Red Army, which supported the Bolshevik government. This conflict lasted until 1923, when the Red Army proved victorious.

1918年，在被软禁两年后，前沙皇、他的妻子和他们的五个孩子被处决。那年爆发了一场内战，反对 列宁的白军与支持布尔什维克政府的红军之间展开了斗争。这场冲突一直持续到1923年，红军取得了 胜利。

By the summer of 1918, these successes meant that Germany held more territory than at any time in the past. In that same summer, however, the mass of U.S. troops finally arrived.

。到 1918 年夏天，这些胜利意味着德国拥有比过去任何时候都多的领 土。然而，同年夏天，大批美军终于抵达。

The situation for Germany was bleak. Food shortages were causing widespread panic and despair. Troops began deserting, and civil unrest spread throughout Germany and Austria-Hungary. German naval commanders wanted to achieve one last moment of glory by sailing the fleet out in late October to engage the British. The German sailors, however, knew there was no chance of victory and had no wish to go on a suicide mission. About one thousand of them mutinied and refused to set sail. In Kiel, home to a major German naval base, both sailors and workers refused to follow orders. The revolt soon spread to other cities.

德国的形势十分严峻。粮食短缺引起了广泛的恐慌和绝望。军队开始开小差，内乱蔓延到整个德国和 奥匈帝国。德国海军指挥官希望在 10 月下旬派遣舰队出海与英国交战，从而获得最后的荣耀。然而， 德国水手们知道没有胜利的机会，也不想执行自杀式任务。其中约有一千人叛变并拒绝起航。在德国 主要海军基地所在地基尔，水手和工人都拒绝服从命令。叛乱很快蔓延到其他城市。

In Berlin, the far-left Socialist Party’s politicians seized on the burgeoning revolt as a way to force a major change in the government and restore order. They called for the abdication of the Kaiser and the establishment of a republic. Wilhelm II abdicated on November 9, 1918, leaving the country for the Netherlands where he lived until his death in 1941. The civilian political leaders of the more moderate Social Democrats now proclaimed a provisional government, making Germany a republic. The German military agreed to work under this new civilian government. Political leaders then took up the negotiations that had already begun for an armistice, or cease-fire agreement, with the Allies. They believed Germany could not win the war and was best served by ending it. This maneuver helped isolate the socialist radicals.

在柏林，极左翼社会党的政客们抓住了迅速兴起的叛乱，以此迫使政府进行重大变革并恢复秩序。他 们呼吁德皇退位并建立共和国。威廉二世于 1918 年 11 月 9 日退位，离开国家前往荷兰，并在那里居 住直至 1941 年去世。较为温和的社会民主党的文职政治领导人现在宣布成立临时政府，使德国成为一 个共和国。德国军方同意在新的文职政府领导下工作。随后，政治领导人开始与盟军进行已经开始的 停战或停火协议谈判。他们认为德国无法赢得战争，结束战争对德国来说是最好的选择。这一策略有 助于孤立社会主义激进分子。

Austria came to terms on an armistice on November 3, 1918, and Hungary followed on November 13. For Germany, an armistice was set to go into effect on November 11 at 11:00 a.m., imposing a cease-fire on all units.

The decision by the Allies to request an armistice instead of a surrender was important. A surrender meant that one side had to accept defeat. This was not something Germany was prepared to do in 1918. The armistice, however, simply meant that a cease-fire would be imposed while formal negotiations occurred. Germany believed these negotiations would allow it to preserve some of its gains in the war and extract itself from the fighting with a measure of honor and dignity.

奥地利于 1918 年 11 月 3 日签署停战协议，匈牙利于 11 月 13 日签署停战协议。对于德国来说，停战 协议定于 11 月 11 日上午 11:00 生效，所有单位停火。盟军请求停战而不是投降的决定 非常重要。投降意味着一方必须接受失败。这并不是德国在 1918 年准备做的事情。然而，停战协定只 是意味着在进行正式谈判时实行停火。德国相信，这些谈判将使其能够保留在战争中的一些成果，并 以一定程度的荣誉和尊严退出战斗。

By the 1930s, economic instability had become common as the Great Depression plunged nations into poverty and unemployment. Governments dealt with the downturn in a variety of ways, but solutions in several countries included more authoritarian policies.

到了 20 世纪 30 年代，大萧条使 各国陷入贫困和失业，经济不稳定变得普遍。各国政府以多种方式应对经济衰退，但一些国家的解决 方案包括更加专制的政策。

Two major and competing forces took shape following World War I. One was disillusionment as the sheer horror of the war was finally understood. The other was the tantalizing idea that society had learned from the war and could build a better tomorrow, freed from the senselessness of war, through new institutions such as the League of Nations. Or, in the case of Russia, a new society would be based on more equitable principles. The reality turned out to be far from the ideal.

第一次世界大战后，形成了两股相互竞争的主要力量。第一股力量是幻想破灭，因为人们终于明白了战争的纯粹恐怖。另一个是诱人的想法，即社会从战争中吸取了教训，可以通过国际联盟等新机构建设一个 更美好的明天，摆脱战争的无意义。或者，就俄罗斯而言，一个新社会将建立在更公平的原则之上。 事实证明，现实与理想相差甚远。

The war also brought into question the notions of superiority that had permeated Western civilization. People wondered whether the West was declining and could no longer consider itself a moral leader in the world.

这场战争(即一战)还对渗透到西方文明中的优越感提出了质疑。 人们想知道西方是否正在衰落，不再认为自己是世界的道德领袖。

Even the victorious nations faced economic problems. Britain and France had borrowed billions to finance the war and had sizable debts to repay, many to the United States.

。即使是战胜国也面临着经济问题。英国和法国借了数十亿美元来资 助战争，并有大量债务需要偿还，其中许多债务是美国的。

The Treaty of Versailles 凡尔赛条约

In January 1919, the leaders of the major Allied powers (except Russia) met outside Paris at Versailles to negotiate the treaty formally ending the war (Figure 12.4). Committees were assigned to resolve the many issues concerning not only Europe but also the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The conference lasted about a year. In its finished form, the Treaty of Versailles was actually a series of treaties.

1919年1月，主要同盟国（俄罗斯除外）领导人在巴黎郊外的凡尔赛宫会面，谈判正式结束战争的条约 。委员会被指派解决不仅涉及欧洲而且还涉及中东、非洲和亚洲的许多问题。会议持续了 大约一年。 《凡尔赛条约》的最终版本实际上是一系列条约

In January 1918, he had already published a plan he hoped would be the basis of the treaty—the Fourteen Points—embodying his wish to prevent future war by solving issues he believed had led to the recent conflict. Among these points were the rights of neutral nations, freedom of the seas, and the need to break up the empires that had caused the war and create new sovereign states in Europe. Wilson’s last point proposed a League of Nations where member nations could come together for mutual security and work out problems without resorting to war.

1918 年 1 月，他(美国伍德罗·威尔逊 ( Woodrow Wilson) 总统)已经公布了一项计划，希望成为该条约的基础—— “十四点” ——体现了他通过解决他认为 导致最近冲突的问题来防止未来战争的愿望。其中包括中立国家的权利、海洋自由，以及瓦解引发战 争的帝国并在欧洲建立新主权国家的必要性。威尔逊的最后一点提出建立国际联盟，成员国可以为了 共同安全而聚集在一起，在不诉诸战争的情况下解决问题。

Wilson also strongly advocated self-determination, the idea that each ethnic group should have its own government. The treaty ushered in a major redrawing of Europe, and new countries flooded onto the map. Their borders were drawn by diplomats in Paris, however, and did not always reflect where people of different nationalities lived. Nor could they. In an already diverse empire such as Austria- Hungary, people of different backgrounds lived side by side, so it was no easy feat to draw a border.

威尔逊还大力提倡自决，即每个民族都应该有自己的政府。该条约带来了欧洲的重大重新划分，新的 国家涌入地图。然而，它们的边界是由巴黎外交官划定的，并不总是反映不同国籍的人居住的地方。 他们也不能。在奥匈帝国这样一个本来就多元化的帝国里，不同背景的人比邻而居，划定边界绝非易 事。

The Germanspeaking country of Austria became an independent nation, as did Hungary. The area of the Balkans, the site of so much uncertainty and nationalism prior to the war, received a particularly unfavorable decision regarding self-determination. The Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Montenegrins, and other Slavic groups there viewed themselves as separate nationalities, yet all were assembled in a single country, to be called Yugoslavia or “land of the Southern Slavs.” Yugoslavia was simply a diplomatic creation, and it did not survive the century.

德语国家奥地利成 为独立国家，匈牙利也成为独立国家。巴尔干地区是战前充满不确定性和民族主义的地区，在自决方 面做出了特别不利的决定。那里的塞尔维亚人、克罗地亚人、波斯尼亚人、黑山人和其他斯拉夫族群 将自己视为不同的民族，但他们都聚集在一个国家，称为南斯拉夫或“南斯拉夫人的土地”。南斯拉夫只 是一个外交创造物，它没有活过这个世纪

Redrawing Europe. These maps show Europe (a) before and (b) after World War I. Notice the postwar proliferation of new countries created by the Treaty of Versailles.

Other provisions of the treaty were designed to weaken Germany. Great Britain and France wanted Germany to literally pay for it, so they began a painstaking financial accounting. Every destroyed house or building was assigned a monetary value. Every lost military and civilian life was assessed an amount based on what that person’s future earnings might have been. These reparations totaled over $30 billion in 1919 dollars. (For context, a loaf of bread cost about 9 cents at the time.) Wilson hoped to persuade the other Allied leaders to abandon this course but was unable to.

该条约的其他条款旨在削弱德国。英国和法国希望德国真正为此付出代 价，因此他们开始进行艰苦的财务核算。每一座被摧毁的房屋或建筑物都被赋予了货币价值。每一位 丧生的军人和平民的生命都会根据该人未来的收入进行评估。按 1919 年美元计算，这些赔款总额超过 300 亿美元。 （作为上下文，当时一条面包的价格约为 9 美分。）威尔逊希望说服其他盟军领导人放 弃这一路线，但未能成功，

One of the clearest punishments the treaty inflicted on Germany was restrictions on its military capacity. The Allied powers hoped that limiting the might of the German Army would limit its aggressiveness. The method of enforcing these limits was not resolved in Paris, however, and it arose as a real issue in the 1930s.

该条约对德国最明显的惩罚之一是限制其军事能力。盟军希望通过限制德国陆军的力量来限制其侵略性。(中共也应该限制军事能力, 才能保持两岸维持现状和保持和平.) 然而， 执行这些限制的方法并未在巴黎得到解决，并在 20 世纪 30 年代成为一个真正的问题。

Germany was also shrunk, losing 13 percent of the territory it had held in Europe before the war. The Saar region was to be administered by the League of Nations. The Rhineland in the west (the Rhine River Valley) became a demilitarized zone. Germany also lost western territory to both France (Alsace-Lorraine, previously seized by Germany) and Belgium. In the east, German lands and the port of Danzig (now GdaÅ„sk) were given to Poland. Other lands went to Lithuania and the new country of Czechoslovakia. As a result, Germany lost about one-tenth of its population, approximately 6.5 million people. It also had to give up its colonies in Asia and Africa.

德国的国土面积也随之缩小，失去了战前在欧洲所占领土的 13%。萨尔地区将由国际联盟管理。西部 的莱茵兰（莱茵河谷）成为非军事区。德国还失去了西部领土给法国（阿尔萨斯-洛林，之前被德国占 领）和比利时。在东部，德国的土地和但泽港（现格达斯克）被割让给波兰。其他土地归立陶宛和新 国家捷克斯洛伐克所有。结果，德国失去了大约十分之一的人口，大约有 650 万人。它还必须放弃在 亚洲和非洲的殖民地。

One provision of the treaty related directly to Japan and China. Japan had occupied China’s Shandong Province, a former German concession, including the port of Qingdao (Tsingtao), and continued to hold it after the war. Without consulting the millions of Chinese people living there at the time, the treaty makers allowed Japan to retain this territory, which it did until 1922.

该条约的一项条款与日本和中国直接相关。日本占领了中国山东省（前德国租界），包括青岛港，并 在战后继续占据它。条约制定者在没有咨询当时居住在那里的数百万中国人民的情况下，允许日本保 留这片领土，直到 1922 年为止。

The racism of the era was apparent in what was not included in the treaty. Japan had requested a clause affirming the equality of all nations regardless of race. This proviso would have set the stage for more open migration and fairer treatment of immigrants (such as Japanese immigrants to the United States). Several powers supported its inclusion, but Australia (which allowed no non-White immigration) and then the United States stated their opposition. Wilson claimed a unanimous vote was necessary to include it, though this was not true for any other clause. In the end, the racial equality clause was absent from the final version of the treaty.

那个时代的种族主义在条约中未包含的内容中显而易见。日本要求制定一项条款，确认所有国家不分 种族一律平等。这一附带条件将为更开放的移民和更公平地对待移民（例如前往美国的日本移民）奠 定基础。多个国家支持将其纳入其中，但澳大利亚（不允许非白人移民）和美国表示反对。威尔逊声 称需要一致投票才能将其纳入其中，但对于任何其他条款而言并非如此。最终，种族平等条款没有出 现在条约的最终版本中。

There was also disappointment. For instance, in 1915, Italy had been promised territory in Dalmatia in return for joining the Allied cause but was forced to relinquish it due to Wilson’s opposition. This prompted anger in Italy and some anti-American rallies. France was annoyed that it had received only part of Germany’s African colonies of Cameroon and Togo while the rest went to Britain. Japan, besides being angered at the rejection of the racial equality clause, was disappointed that it had not been given all of Germany’s colonial holdings in Asia and the Pacific. It received only some, while others went to New Zealand and Australia. Internal ethnic issues had not been fully solved by the treaty (such as in the creation of Czechoslovakia) and could easily resurface given the chance.

也有失望。 例如，1915年，意大利曾被许诺在达尔马提亚拥有领土，以换取加入盟军的事业，但由于威尔逊的反 对而被迫放弃。这引发了意大利的愤怒和一些反美集会。法国感到恼火的是，它只接收了德国非洲殖 民地喀麦隆和多哥的一部分，而其余的则归英国所有。日本除了对拒绝种族平等条款感到愤怒外，还 对德国没有获得德国在亚洲和太平洋地区的全部殖民地感到失望。它只收到了一些，而其他则流向了 新西兰和澳大利亚。该条约尚未完全解决内部种族问题（例如捷克斯洛伐克的创建），并且一旦有机 会很容易重新浮出水面。

The U.S. Senate’s biggest worry about the Treaty of Versailles was that if the United States joined the League of Nations, its troops could be sent anywhere in the world, drawing the nation into foreign disputes that the Senate, then dominated by the Republican Party, wanted to avoid. Senators feared the treaty would thus cost them their constitutional power to declare war. They also objected to Britain and France’s desire to control the League. For these reasons, the United States did not approve the treaty and did not join the League of Nations. The organization’s ability to mediate and resolve international disputes was weakened by the lack of U.S. participation.

美国参议院对《凡尔赛条约》最大的担忧是，如果美国加入国际联盟，其军队可能被派往世界任何地 方，从而将美国卷入当时由共和党主导的参议院所希望的外国争端中。避免。参议员们担心该条约将 剥夺他们宣战的宪法权力。他们还反对英国和法国控制联盟的愿望。由于这些原因，美国没有批准该 条约，也没有加入国际联盟。由于缺乏美国的参与，该组织调解和解决国际争端的能力受到削弱。

China was frustrated that Japan was allowed to retain Shandong under the treaty, but its protests fell on deaf ears. Anger at China’s treatment helped lead to the May Fourth Movement, which began in Beijing in 1919 as a protest by students. It grew to include labor strikes, calls for a boycott of Japanese-made products, and the removal of Japanese-leaning government officials.

中国对日本根据条约获准保留山东感到沮丧，但日本的抗议却被置若罔闻。 对中国待遇的愤怒引发了五四运动，该运动于 1919 年在北京以学生抗议活动为起点。其发展内容包括 罢工、呼吁抵制日本制造的产品以及罢免亲日政府官员。

World War I devastated the world’s economies. The reparations owed by Germany were the means by which Britain and France planned to deal with their own debt, but they also created an economic house of cards that could easily tumble down.

第一次世界大战摧毁了世界经济。德国所欠的赔款是英国和法国计划用来处理自己债 务的手段，但它们也创造了一个 很容易倒塌的经济纸牌屋。

In the Taisho period in the 1920s, the Japanese economy was buffeted by booms and recessions, the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, inflation, and a serious banking crisis in 1927. Japan had become heavily dependent on trade with the United States, and its urban economy was now undermined by the protectionism practiced by both U.S. and European markets in the form of tariffs on foreign imports. Japan’s economy continued growing in the 1920s, however, as the country increased military production and began making investments in China.

在 1920 年代的大正时期，日本经济经历了繁荣和衰退、1923 年关东大地震、通货膨胀以及 1927 年 严重的银行危机。日本已经严重依赖与美国的贸易，其城市经济也受到影响。美国和欧洲市场以对外 国进口商品征收关税的形式实行的保护主义，损害了经济。然而，随着日本增加军事生产并开始在中 国投资，日本经济在 20 年代继续增长

The United States did not suffer the physical devastation of war that the other Allies did. It emerged from the conflict in a position of economic power, a creditor nation to be repaid for its wartime loans to Britain and France. Thus, the 1920s were a decade of prosperity for the country.

美国没有像其他盟国那样遭受战争的物质破坏。它从冲突中崛起，成为经济大国，成为需要偿还向英 国和法国提供的战时贷款的债权国。因此，20年代是国家繁荣的十年。
