Slavery and Serfdom

奴隶制和农奴制

By the end of the nineteenth century, chattel slavery, in which one human being is owned by another and can be bought or sold, lingered in only a few places on the globe. Some nations had already abolished slavery before the Second Industrial Revolution began. Japan officially did so in the sixteenth century. Britain abolished the slave trade and ended slavery completely in 1834. France banned slavery in 1848, freeing nearly all enslaved people in the Caribbean. In India, the Penal Code of 1861 punished those who attempted to enslave others. The Netherlands and the United States were among the last industrialized nations to end the practice, with the Dutch freeing enslaved people in the South American colony of Suriname in 1863 and the United States abolishing slavery with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to its Constitution in 1865.

到十九世纪末，动产奴隶制（一个人为另一个人所有，可以买卖）仅在全球少数地方存在。在第二次 工业革命开始之前，一些国家就已经废除了奴隶制。日本在十六世纪正式这样做了。英国于1834年废 除奴隶贸易并彻底结束奴隶制。法国于1848年禁止奴隶制，解放了加勒比地区几乎所有被奴役的人。 在印度， 1861 年的刑法典惩罚那些企图奴役他人的人。荷兰和美国是最后结束奴隶制的工业化国家之 一，荷兰于 1863 年解放了南美殖民地苏里南的奴隶制，美国于 1865 年通过了宪法第十三条修正案， 废除了奴隶制。

Most Latin American nations ended slavery following their wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. Brazil, however, with its primarily agricultural economy, long resisted reformers’ calls for emancipation. In 1850, the country finally bowed to pressure from its chief trading partner, Great Britain, which had assumed the moral duty of abolishing slavery around the world soon after it liberated its own enslaved people.

大多数拉丁美洲国家在十九世纪初的独立战争后结束了奴隶制。然而，巴西以其农业经济为主，长期 以来一直抵制改革者的解放呼吁(巴西最终于1888年彻底废除了奴隶制)。 1850年，该国最终屈服于其主要贸易伙伴英国的压力，英国在解放 自己的被奴役人民后不久就承担起了废除世界各地奴隶制的道义责任。

Serfdom also largely disappeared in the second half of the nineteenth century. Serfs were unfree peasants who were legally bound to work the land on which they lived, land that was owned by another. Russia held nearly all Europe’s remaining serfs. Approximately eleven million were owned by private citizens, and another twelve to thirteen million were owned by the state. Tsar Alexander II abolished serfdom in Russia in 1861. In some parts of the Russian empire, serfdom lingered on for a few more decades.

农奴制也在十九世纪下半叶基本上消失了。农奴是不自由的农民，他们在法律上有义务在他们所居住 的土地上耕作，这些土地属于他人所有。俄罗斯几乎拥有欧洲所有剩余的农奴。大约 1100 万个为私人 所有，另外 12 至 1300 万个为国家所有。 1861年，沙皇亚历山大二世废除了俄罗斯的农奴制。。在俄罗斯帝国的一些地区，农奴制又持续了几十年。

Contract Labor and Debt Bondage

合同工和债役

While slavery and serfdom disappeared from the industrialized world in the nineteenth century, other means remained for securing a long-term or permanent labor force for both agricultural and industrial production. Two such systems are contract labor and debt bondage. Contract labor, a system in which people sign contracts promising to perform work in exchange for a fee, still exists today. Indentured servitude is a form of contract labor in which people pledge to work for an agreed period of time for an agreed form of compensation. Although indentured servants are not enslaved, while their contract is in force, their employers have nearly total control over them, and they are not allowed to leave their service. Debt bondage is a system in which a person who owes money works (or provides someone else to work) for the creditor until the debt has been repaid through labor. Indentured servitude and debt bondage are similar and were common in the later nineteenth century; they differ from slavery in that, theoretically, at a point in time the bondage will end.

虽然奴隶制和农奴制在十九世纪从工业化世界消失，但仍然存在其他手段来确保农业和工业生产的长 期或永久劳动力。两个这样的制度是合同劳动和债役。合同工是一种人们签署合同承诺完成工作以换 取报酬的制度，至今仍然存在。契约劳役是合同劳动的一种形式，人们承诺在约定的时间内工作以获 得约定形式的补偿。尽管契约仆人不是奴隶，但在合同生效期间，雇主几乎完全控制他们，并且不允 许他们离开服务。债役是一种欠债人为债权人工作（或提供他人工作）直至通过劳动偿还债务的制 度。契约奴役和债务奴役很相似，并且在 19 世纪后期很常见；它们与奴隶制的不同之处在于，从理论 上讲，奴隶制在某个时间点将会结束。

In the United States, indentured servitude had been common during the colonial period, and it was the means by which many Europeans obtained passage to North America. The practice had largely died out in the United States by the middle of the nineteenth century but still existed in a few places. In Hawaii, plantation owners used contract labor from Portugal, China, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines to grow their crops, especially sugarcane. Many Chinese immigrants also came to the United States as contract laborers. They were not working under a contract with their employer. Instead, they had agreed to work for one of their compatriots to pay for their passage to the United States. Many Chinese workers were taken abroad by the Six Companies, a Chinese-owned business formed to transport Chinese immigrants to North America, and they had to repay their debt to the company before they were allowed to return home.

在美国，契约奴役在殖民时期很常见，它是许多欧洲人获得进入北美的通道的手段。到十九世纪中 叶，这种做法在美国已基本消失，但在少数地方仍然存在。在夏威夷，种植园主使用来自葡萄牙、中 国、韩国、日本和菲律宾的合同工来种植农作物，尤其是甘蔗。许多中国移民也以合同工的身份来到 美国。他们没有按照与雇主的合同进行工作。相反，他们同意为其中一位同胞工作，以支付他们前往 美国的旅费。许多中国工人被六家公司（一家为将中国移民运送到北美而成立的中资企业）带到国 外，他们必须偿还公司的债务才能获准回国。

Other parts of the world also relied on various forms of contract labor once slavery had been abolished. During the nineteenth century, Australia depended on indentured laborers from the islands of the Pacific.

Reports about their poor treatment convinced many industrialized countries to end participation in the trade. Britain prohibited its ships from carrying Asian laborers to Cuba and Peru, two of the main destinations. In 1874, Portugal, following Britain’s example, prevented the trade from being carried on in Macao, a Portuguese colony in Asia through which many Chinese laborers were shipped elsewhere in the world.

废除奴隶制后，世界其他地区也依赖各种形式的合同工。十九世纪，澳大利亚依赖太平洋岛屿的契约 劳工. 有关其恶劣待遇的报道说服了许多工业化国 家停止参与贸易。英国禁止其船只载运亚洲劳工前往古巴和秘鲁这两个主要目的地。 1874年，葡萄牙 效仿英国，禁止在葡萄牙在亚洲的殖民地澳门进行贸易，许多中国劳工通过澳门被运送到世界其他地 方。

Debt bondage was also a common source of labor in some parts of the world in the late nineteenth century. In the 1880s in Japan, faced with an economic depression that led many to bankruptcy and starvation, parents “rented” their children, especially daughters, to factories. The girls were provided with food and shelter, and money they earned was sent home to their parents. Daughters might also be hired out to brothels.

In the United States, debt bondage was a common means by which southern farmers kept a labor force of African American people and poor White people at their disposal.

十九世纪末，债役也是世界某些地区常见的劳动力来源。 1880 年代的日本，经济萧条导致许多人破产 和挨饿，父母将孩子，尤其是女儿“租”到工厂。女孩们得到了食物和住所，她们赚到的钱也被寄回家给 父母。女儿们也可能被雇到妓院. 在美国， 债役是南方农民保留非裔美国人和贫穷白人劳动力的常见手段。

Penal Labor

劳役

Forced labor assigned as punishment to those convicted of crimes, known as penal labor, was also employed in the second half of the nineteenth century. From 1788 to 1868, British convicts, most of whom had been found guilty of nonviolent crimes, were given the choice of languishing in a cell or being transported to the colony of Australia. If they chose Australia, after an ocean journey that might last eight months, they had to endure seven to ten years of labor. The unlucky might be assigned to work gangs, building roads or constructing government buildings. Others went to work for farmers or merchants. After they had served their sentences, they were free to remain in Australia as settlers or return to England.

十九世纪下半叶还采用了强迫劳动作为对犯罪者的惩罚，称为刑罚劳动。从 1788 年到 1868 年，英国 囚犯（其中大多数被判犯有非暴力罪行）可以选择在牢房里受苦或被送往澳大利亚殖民地。如果他们 选择了澳大利亚，经过八个月的远洋航行，他们就必须忍受七到十年的劳作。不幸的人可能会被分配 到工作队、修路或建造政府大楼。其他人则为农民或商人工作。服刑完毕后，他们可以自由地作为定 居者留在澳大利亚或返回英国。

Like Britain, Russia used convicted prisoners to satisfy the need for labor in distant parts of the empire, where it was difficult to attract voluntary settlers. The katorga system sent prisoners to Siberia and the Russian Far East. The men, often political prisoners, typically felled timber or worked in mines. Sometimes they were rented out to private employers.

与英国一样，俄罗斯也利用被定罪的囚犯来满足帝国偏远地区的劳动力需求，因为那里很难吸引自愿 定居者。卡托加系统将囚犯送往西伯利亚和俄罗斯远东地区。这些人通常是政治犯，通常 砍伐木材或在矿山工作。有时它们被出租给私人雇主。

Many other countries, such as the United States, also used convicts for labor or rented them for use by private citizens. People found guilty of and imprisoned for actual crimes were also often required to perform free labor, either inside or outside the prison. Prisoners were often used to build roads in the southern United States.

许多其他国家，例如美国，也使用囚犯作为劳工或出租给私人公民使用。因实际犯罪而被判有罪和入狱的人也常常被要求在监狱内外进行 免费劳动。在美国南部，囚犯经常被用来修路。

European Immigration

欧洲移民

Over the course of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century, approximately sixty million Europeans sought better economic opportunities on other continents. Most came from relatively nonindustrialized or agricultural regions, such as southern Italy and Sicily. Approximately twenty-eight million Europeans and Canadians immigrated to the United States during this time, the majority between 1890 and 1914. Most were peasant farmers from southern and eastern Europe. Many also continued to arrive from Germany and Ireland, the countries that had been responsible for the greatest influx of immigrants in the first half of the nineteenth century. Along with those fleeing poverty came victims of religious persecution, especially Jewish people of the Russian empire. Political dissidents and craftspeople displaced by industrialization made up the rest.

在十九世纪和二十世纪的前几十年里，大约六千万欧洲人在其他大陆寻求更好的经济机会。大多数来 自相对非工业化或农业地区，例如意大利南部和西西里岛。在此期间，大约有 2800 万欧洲人和加拿大 人移民到美国，其中大多数是在 1890 年至 1914 年间。大多数是来自南欧和东欧的农民。许多人还继 续来自德国和爱尔兰，这两个国家是十九世纪上半叶移民涌入最多的国家。除了那些逃离贫困的人之 外，还有宗教迫害的受害者，特别是俄罗斯帝国的犹太人。剩下的人是持不同政见者和因工业化 而流离失所的工匠。

After the United States, it was Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay that received the largest numbers. Some 4.5 million emigrants went to Argentina, where at one point they made up 30 percent of the population. Latin America attracted many Italians and Germans as well as Spanish and Portuguese settlers. Canada was the destination of approximately 5.1 million people between the 1850s and the 1920s. Other common landing places for European immigrants were Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

继美国之后，接收人数最多的是阿根廷、巴西、智利和乌拉圭。大约有 450 万移民前往阿根廷，一度 占该国人口的 30%。拉丁美洲吸引了许多意大利人和德国人以及西班牙和葡萄牙定居者。 1850 年代 至 1920 年代，加拿大是大约 510 万人的目的地。欧洲移民的其他常见登陆地包括澳大利亚、新西兰和 南非。

In the United States, the “foreign” ways of Germans and eastern European Christians might be mocked but were largely accepted. Irish newcomers, most of whom were Roman Catholics, had been rejected when they first began to migrate to the largely Protestant United States in large numbers in the 1840s and 1850s, but by the second half of the nineteenth century, they and their children had established themselves as politicians, business owners, and police officers. Jewish people and Italians, however, who were more recent immigrants, often faced discrimination, and anti-Semitism was prevalent.

在美国，德国人和东欧基督徒的“外国”生活方式可能会 受到嘲笑，但基本上被接受了。爱尔兰新移民（其中大多数是罗马天主教徒）在 1840 年代和 1850 年 代第一次开始大量移民到以新教为主的美国时曾遭到拒绝，但到了 19 世纪下半叶，他们和他们的孩子 已经建立了他们自己是政治家、企业主和警察。然而，犹太人和意大利人作为新移民，经常面临歧 视，反犹太主义盛行。

By the end of the nineteenth century, many native-born Protestants of northern European ancestry in the United States began to call for changes in immigration laws. These calls were met in 1924 with the passage of the Johnson-Reed Act, which set a quota on the total number of immigrants allowed to enter the United States from outside the Western Hemisphere. In addition, the act limited the number of immigrants of each nationality to 2 percent of the number already living in the United States in 1890. Thus, a person might be turned away if the permitted number of immigrants of that particular nationality had already been admitted, even if the total limit had not been reached. Before 1890, most immigrants had come from northern and western Europe and relatively few from southern or eastern Europe. Thus, the 2 percent quota allowed far more English, Irish, and German people to enter than Italian, Polish, or Russian Jewish people. Immigration from Asia, with the exception of the U.S. territory of the Philippines, was banned.

到十九世纪末，许多在美国本土出生的北欧血统的新教徒开始呼吁修改移民法。 1924 年，约翰逊-里 德法案的通过满足了这些呼吁，该法案对允许从西半球以外进入美国的移民总数设定了配额。此外， 该法案将每个国籍的移民人数限制为 1890 年已居住在美国的人数的 2%。因此，如果该特定国籍的移 民的允许人数已经被接纳，则该人可能会被拒绝入境。 ，即使尚未达到总限制。 1890 年之前，大多 数移民来自北欧和西欧，来自南欧或东欧的移民相对较少。因此，2%的配额允许更多的英国人、爱尔 兰人和德国人进入，而不是意大利、波兰或俄罗斯的犹太人。除美国领土菲律宾外，来自亚洲的移民 均被禁止。

In Latin America, the situation was much different. Argentina and Uruguay, for instance, had never had large populations because they lacked their neighbors’ mineral wealth and climates conducive to the growing of sugar and coffee. The arrival of European immigrants there was thus a welcome boost. Brazil and Venezuela deliberately sought out European immigrants to make their predominantly African, Native American, and biracial population more White.

在拉丁美洲，情况则大不相同。例如，阿根廷和乌拉圭从来没有大量人口，因为它们缺乏邻国的矿产 资源和有利于糖和咖啡种植的气候。因此，欧洲移民的到来受到了欢迎。巴西和委内瑞拉故意寻找欧 洲移民，以使他们以非洲人、美洲原住民和混血儿为主的人口更加白人化。

In the nineteenth century, many people of East Asia and India left home to seek work abroad, just as many Europeans did. Most who left China were escaping poverty. Primarily men, they came largely from the southern provinces, especially Fujian, where the quality of the land had always made agriculture difficult, and Guangdong. In the middle of the nineteenth century, many Chinese people fled hardships occasioned by the deadliest civil war in the history of the world. From 1850 to 1864, more than twenty million Chinese people died in the Taiping Rebellion.

十九世纪，许多东亚和印度人离开家乡到国外寻找工作，就像许多欧洲人一样。大多数离开中国的人 都是为了摆脱贫困。他们以男性为主，大部分来自南方省份，尤其是福建和广东，那里的土地质量一 直使农业困难。十九世纪中叶，许多中国人民逃离了世界历史上最惨重的内战带来的苦难。从 1850 年 到 1864 年，超过 2000 万中国人在太平天国运动中丧生

The Chinese diaspora in the nineteenth century was perhaps the widest of any ethnic group, dispersing emigrants around the globe. Chinese laborers came to the Kingdom of Hawaii to work on sugarcane plantations. They sought work in the United States building railroads, mining, and working as agricultural laborers and in service occupations. Thousands of Chinese people performed similar jobs in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Chinese people also immigrated to Europe, primarily Britain, as well as to Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, and South Africa. They were hired as contract laborers in South African gold mines when the owners realized they would work longer hours for lower wages than would native Africans, who often left the mines after a few years.

十九世纪的华人侨民可能是所有族群中最广泛的，他们将移民分散到全球各地。中国劳工来到夏威夷 王国在甘蔗种植园工作。他们在美国寻找修建铁路、采矿、农业劳工和服务业的工作。在加拿大不列 颠哥伦比亚省，有数千名中国人从事类似的工作。中国人还移民到欧洲，主要是英国，以及印度尼西 亚、马来西亚、澳大利亚和南非。当矿主意识到他们的工作时间会比非洲本地人低，工作时间更长， 而非洲本地人往往在几年后离开金矿时，他们就被雇用为南非金矿的合同工。

Most people have heard of Ellis Island, the immigration station in the New York City harbor that welcomed millions of European immigrants to the United States. Less well known was Angel Island in San Francisco Bay that served as the station through which most Asian immigrants were processed while they awaited permission to enter the United States or were returned to their home countries. Today, it is a national historic landmark.

大多数人都听说过埃利斯岛，这是纽约市港口的移民站，欢迎数百万欧洲移民来到美国。不 太为人所知的是旧金山湾的天使岛，它是大多数亚洲移民在等待进入美国或返回祖国时经过 的中转站。如今，它已成为国家历史地标。

Large numbers of Chinese people also sought opportunities in South America and the Caribbean. In Peru, the abolition of slavery in 1854 left the country desperate for workers, and the government subsidized the importation of laborers. Approximately 100,000 Chinese people immigrated as contract laborers between 1849 and 1874 to fill the need for workers to mine guano (bird and bat excrement used as fertilizer), build railroads, and toil on sugarcane and cotton plantations. Their contracts typically bound them to work for four to eight years. During that time, they were subjected to harsh punishments, including whipping and confinement in plantation jails. When their contracts ended, those who did not find themselves trapped in debt bondage often moved to the cities.

大批中国人也到南美和加勒比地区寻找机会。在秘鲁，1854年奴隶制的废除使该国急需工人，政府为 输入劳动力提供补贴。 1849 年至 1874 年间，大约有 10 万中国人以合同工的身份移民，以满足开采 鸟粪（用作肥料的鸟类和蝙蝠粪便）、修建铁路以及在甘蔗和棉花种植园劳作的工人的需求。他们的 合同通常规定他们工作四到八年。在此期间，他们受到严厉的惩罚，包括鞭打和监禁在种植园监狱 中。当合同结束时，那些没有发现自己陷入债务束缚的人往往会搬到城市。

Chinese people emigrated to other places in Latin America and the Caribbean as well. Many built railroads in the Spanish colony of Cuba; concerned that they were being mistreated, China signed a treaty with Spain in 1896 to end all labor contracts that bound Chinese laborers. In the 1870s, Mexico’s president Porfirio Diaz encouraged Chinese people to immigrate to Mexico and settle in the northern part of the country. Diaz had first invited European and White U.S. settlers to Mexico to build railroads. When these laborers found life in the desert undesirable, Diaz invited the Chinese to settle instead.

中国人也移民到拉丁美洲和加勒比地区的其他地方。许多人在古巴的西班牙殖民地修建了铁路；由于 担心他们受到虐待，中国于 1896 年与西班牙签署了一项条约，终止了所有约束中国劳工的劳动合同。 1870年代，墨西哥总统波菲里奥·迪亚斯鼓励华人移民墨西哥并在该国北部定居。迪亚兹首先邀请欧洲 和美国白人定居者到墨西哥修建铁路。当这些劳工发现沙漠生活不受欢迎时，迪亚兹邀请 中国人定居。

In Japan, economic depression also led many young men and women to seek their fortunes abroad.The Japanese government encouraged emigration and entered into contractual agreements with other countries to provide labor. Japanese immigration was largely confined to the Pacific region and to the Americas.

在日本，经济萧条也导致许多青年男女出国寻求财富。日本政府鼓励移民并与其他国家签订提供劳动力的合同协议。日本移民主要局限于太平 洋地区和美洲。

Asian immigrants found themselves more unwelcome than European immigrants were. In 1882, the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prevented all Chinese laborers from immigrating to the country. The Johnson-Reed Act banned all immigration from Asia, with the exception of people coming from U.S. territories in the Pacific. Although Canada did not ban Asian immigration, in 1885 it placed a tax of $50 on all Chinese people entering the country to work. Students, scientists, merchants, and government officials were exempt, but in subsequent years, the tax was raised.

亚洲移民发现自己比欧洲移民更不受欢迎。 1882年，美国通过了《排华法案》 ，禁止所有华工移民到 美国。约翰逊-里德法案禁止所有来自亚洲的移民，但来自太平洋美国领土的人除外。尽管加拿大没有 禁止亚洲移民，但在 1885 年，它对所有进入该国工作的中国人征收 50 美元的税。学生、科学家、商 人和政府官员可以免税，但在随后的几年里，税收提高了。

Asian immigrants to South America also faced hostility. Violent attacks on Chinese people took place in Peru in the nineteenth century, as they had in the United States before Chinese immigration was banned. Portuguese-speaking Brazilians regarded the Japanese people, who resisted becoming bilingual and maintained schools and newspapers in their own language, as unassimilable, and in 1923 the government imposed a strict quota on immigrants from Japan.

前往南美洲的亚洲移民也面临敌意。十九世纪的秘鲁曾发生过针对华人的暴力袭击事件，就像禁止中 国移民之前的美国一样。日本人拒绝双语并用自己的语言维持学校和报纸，讲葡萄牙语的巴西人认为 日本人是不可同化的，1923年，政府对来自日本的移民实行了严格的配额。

By the beginning of the twentieth century, Australia also wished to limit immigration to only Europeans. At the urging of members of the working class, who believed the willingness of the Chinese people to work for low wages hurt them, Australia required that all furniture made by Chinese workers bear a label stating that fact. All this was part of the White Australia Policy, a movement to exclude Asians and Pacific Islanders from the country.

到了二十世纪初，澳大利亚也希望只允许欧洲人移民。在工人阶级成员的敦促下，澳大利亚要求中国工 人制造的所有家具都贴上说明这一事实的标签，他们认为中国人愿意接受低工资，这伤害了他们。所 有这些都是白澳大利亚政策的一部分，这是一项将亚洲人和太平洋岛民排除在该国之外的运动。

The White Australia Policy culminated in the passage of the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, excluding anyone who could not pass a dictation test administered in a European language.

白澳大利亚政策最终导致 1901 年《移民限制法》的通过，该法案排除了任何无法通过欧洲语言听写测 试的人。

In 1871, the British government legalized their existence, and in 1875, Parliament made it legal for workers to strike as well.

1871年，英国政府使罢工合法化，1875年，议会也使工人罢工合法化。

In Britain and the United States, the organization of unions developed independent of politics. In places such as Germany, France, and Russia, however, political ideology spurred the development of unions. The predominant political ideology that influenced their growth was socialism. Today, socialism is a political theory that advocates the ownership of the means of production by the government. Socialism in the nineteenth century was somewhat different and took many forms. The only unifying features were a dislike of laissez-faire capitalism, a desire to improve the lives of the poor, and a belief that the government

在英国和美国，工会组织的发展独立于政治。然而，在德国、法国和俄罗斯等地，政治意识形态刺激 了工会的发展。影响他们成长的主要政治意识形态是社会主义。今天，社会主义是一种主张政府拥有 生产资料的政治理论。十九世纪的社会主义有所不同，并采取多种形式。唯一的共同特征是不喜欢自 由放任的资本主义，渴望改善穷人的生活，并相信政府应该负责解决资本主义和工业化引起的问题。

Marx never attempted to put his philosophy into practice. However, during the period of the Second Industrial Revolution, many workers turned to his ideas as a basis on which to organize unions and establish political parties. In 1864, socialists founded the International Workingmen’s Association (IWA) in London. Many different types of socialists belonged to the IWA, including Marx, and conflict soon arose over a variety of issues. Some socialists advocated the use of violence to effect change, while others advocated more peaceful, democratic means. Those who favored peaceful means are often called social democrats.

马克思从未试图将他的哲学付诸实践。然而，在第二次工业革命时期，许多工人转向他的思想作为组 织工会和建立政党的基础。 1864年，社会主义者在伦敦成立了国际工人协会（IWA） 。许多不同类型 的社会主义者都属于国际工人协会，包括马克思，很快就在各种问题上发生了冲突。一些社会主义者 主张使用暴力来实现变革，而另一些社会主义者则主张采用更和平、民主的手段。那些赞成和平手段 的人通常被称为社会民主党人。

Another source of conflict among socialists was the role to be played by government in the construction of the ideal socialist state. Although Marx wrote of government eventually disappearing once class divisions had been erased and equality achieved, he also indicated that, until then, a government of the workers would be needed to manage society. Some socialists feared the existence of this new government would simply lead to the creation of a new group of authorities to oppress the people. They believed government should be abolished, an ideology known as anarchism.

社会主义者之间冲突的另一个根源是政府在建设理想的社会主义国家中所扮演的角色。尽管马克思写 道，一旦消除了阶级划分并实现了平等，政府最终就会消失，但他也指出，在那之前，需要一个工人 的政府来管理社会。一些社会主义者担心这个新政府的存在只会导致建立一个新的当局来压迫人民。 他们认为应该废除政府，这种意识形态被称为无政府主义。

World War I served as a clear demarcation line. By separating the world of empires from an emerging and more modern world, the conflict set the stage for a redrawn map of Europe. It featured many characteristics that have since become common in warfare—total war, civilian losses, massive numbers of troops in armies, and warfare that relies on military technology as well as the courageous charge of soldiers against enemies.

第一次世界大战是一个明确的分界线。这场冲突将帝国世界与新兴的、更现代的世界分开，为重新绘 制的欧洲地图奠定了基础。它具有许多后来在战争中常见的特征——全面战争、平民损失、军队数量 庞大、依靠军事技术和士兵对敌人的勇敢冲锋的战争

By the early twentieth century, Europe had achieved outward stability through a series of alliances. Such accords were a hallmark of nineteenth-century diplomacy and had maintained peace for decades on the continent, compressing the wars that did occur into finite conflicts. In the 1900s, these alliances had solidified two opposed groups, each with major powers that allied with one another and then developed relationships with smaller nations.

到二十世纪初，欧洲通过一系列联盟实现了外部稳定。此类协议是十九世纪外交的一个标志，几十年 来维持了非洲大陆的和平，将确实发生的战争压缩为有限的冲突。在 1900 年代，这些联盟巩固了两个 对立的群体，每个群体都拥有相互结盟的大国，然后又与较小国家发展关系.

The decades before the world erupted into the Great War, as World War I was known, were generally marked by great stability. The work done in 1815 to create a balance of power among European nations in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars had been quite successful. The Concert of Europe—an informal agreement to maintain the status quo—had been able to absorb some internal conflicts and the growth of more liberal political thoughts without incurring political or territorial instability. There were occasionally military conflicts, but these were usually of short duration and limited in scale.

世界爆发第一次世界大战之前的几十年，总体上非常稳定。 1815 年拿破仑战争后，欧洲国家之间建立 权力平衡的工作相当成功。欧洲协约——维持现状的非正式协议——能够吸收一些内部冲突和更加自 由主义政治思想的增长，而不会导致政治或领土不稳定。偶尔也会发生军事冲突，但通常持续时间短 且规模有限。

The fighting in these wars was localized, and because they were short, the conflicts did not require the mobilization of a country’s economy or full resources. They did not involve numerous countries either, and the fighting rarely spilled over into other nations’ lands.

这些战争的战斗都是局部性的，而且由于时间短，冲突不需要动员 一个国家的经济或全部资源。它们 也没有涉及很多国家，战斗也很少蔓延到其他国家的领土上。

Since he first rose to power in 1862, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck hoped to check the power of Russia and France by developing a series of alliances. A military alliance with Austria-Hungary was created to stand up to Russia. This alliance later grew to include Italy and became formalized as the Triple Alliance. In 1894, Russia and France signed a treaty pledging military support for one another if attacked and requiring each to mobilize its armies if the other did so. In 1907, the Triple Entente was created between Russia, France, and Britain, growing out of a shared distrust of German aims.

自 1862 年首次掌权以来，德国总理奥托·冯·俾斯麦希望通过发展一系列联盟来遏制俄罗斯和法国的实力, 。与奥匈帝国建立军事联盟以对 抗俄罗斯。这个联盟后来扩大到包括意大利，并正式成为三国联盟。 1894年，俄罗斯和法国签署了一 项条约，承诺在对方受到攻击时向对方提供军事支持，并要求对方在对方这样做时动员其军队。 1907 年，由于对德国目标的共同不信任，俄罗斯、法国和英国之间建立了三国协约。

By the early twentieth century, then, a series of alliances had effectively divided Europe into two blocs of power. One bloc included Russia, France, and Britain, and the other Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. While these two groups stood opposed to one another, there were nuances in the arrangements. Britain, for example, had not promised any mutual aid in times of war when it signed its initial agreement with France, nor had it done so in its agreement with Russia, while France was bound to provide military support for Russia if Russia were attacked and not the aggressor.

到了二十世纪初期，一系列联盟实际上将欧洲分成了两个权力集团。一个集团包括俄罗斯、法国和英国，另一个集团包括德国、奥匈帝国和意大利。虽然这 两个群体彼此对立，但安排上却存在细微差别。例如，英国在与法国签署最初的协议时并没有承诺在 战时提供互助，在与俄罗斯的协议中也没有承诺，而如果俄罗斯受到攻击，法国有义务向俄罗斯提供 军事支持。不是侵略者。

What these new alliances also did was provide fuel for the German emperor Wilhelm II’s growing concern that he was surrounded by hostile nations. Germany faced a hostile France to its west and Russia to its east.

这些新联盟还加剧了德国皇帝威廉二世对自己被敌对国家包围的担忧. 德国西面面对敌对的法国，东面面对俄罗斯。

The view that imperial strength should be devoted to colony building was still very much in place in the late 1800s. Still industrializing, and having unified as a country only in 1871, Germany soon felt the pressure to build an overseas empire. But there were limited locales it could target.

1800 年代末，帝国力量应该投入殖民地建设的观点仍然很盛行。德国仍在工业化进程中，直到 1871 年才统一为一个国家，很快就感受到了建立海外帝国的压力，。但它可以定位的区域有限。

Germany began to look to the Pacific as a place where it could establish itself as a colonial power. The United States, Britain, France, Japan, and the Netherlands already held extensive territory in the Pacific. Germany soon claimed part of New Guinea, part of the Solomon Islands, and the Marshall Islands. In 1899, Germany’s growing power in the Pacific led to the partitioning of the Samoan Islands with the United States. Germany also gained some of the smaller island groups—Palau, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands—by the beginning of the twentieth century. In addition, it planned to join the “Scramble for Africa” in which European nations were engaging to shore up their colonial holdings on the African continent.

德国开始将太平洋视为一个可以将自己建立为殖民国家的地方。美国、英国、法国、日本和荷兰已经 在太平洋拥有大片领土。德国很快就宣称对新几内亚的部分地区、所罗门群岛的部分地区和马绍尔群 岛的部分地区拥有主权。 1899年，德国在太平洋地区实力的增强导致萨摩亚群岛与美国瓜分。到二十 世纪初，德国还获得了一些较小的岛屿群——帕劳群岛、加罗林群岛和马里亚纳群岛。此外，它还计 划加入欧洲国家参与的“非洲争夺”，以巩固其在非洲大陆的殖民地。

When Germany went in search of African colonies, there was not much left. Britain, France, Belgium, and Portugal had already seized control of most of the continent and did not welcome the claims of yet another European nation. Germany took a portion of East Africa and Southwest Africa, which had a large border with the British colonies. Togoland and the Cameroons also became part of the German colonial empire.

当德国寻找非洲殖民地时，所剩无几。英国、法国、比利时和葡萄牙已经控制了欧洲大陆的大部分地 区，并且不欢迎另一个欧洲国家的主权要求。德国占领了东非和西南部非洲的一部分，这些地区与英 国殖民地有很大的边界。多哥兰和喀麦隆也成为德国殖民帝国的一部分

Naval power assumed a greater role in world affairs in the late nineteenth century. As more of the industrialized nations embarked on empire building, and as reaching international markets became an expected part of their strategy, the value of having strong navies to protect commercial trade only grew. Maintaining supply and fueling stations around the world to service these navies and fleets of merchant ships became a key argument in favor of developing more colonies.

十九世纪末，海军力量在世界事务中发挥了更大的作用。随着越来越多的工业化国家开始建立帝国， 并且进入国际市场成为其战略的预期组成部分，拥有强大海军来保护商业贸易的价值只会越来越大。 在世界各地维持供应和加油站为这些海军和商船队提供服务成为支持发展更多殖民地的关键论据。

At the start of the twentieth century, Great Britain was still the unmatched naval power in the world. Kaiser Wilhelm II was determined to counter Britain’s sea power by building up the German navy.

二十世纪初，英国仍然是世界上无与伦比的海军强国。德皇威廉二世决心通过建立德国海军来对抗英 国的海上力量。

The British army, which relied on volunteer troops, was still relatively small at the onset of the war. The Old Regulars, as they were known, numbered only a little over a quarter-million. The strength of Britain lay rather in its navy.

战争开始时，依赖志愿军的英国军队规模仍然相对较小。众所周知，老正规军的人数只有25万多一 点。英国的实力主要在于其海军。

The United States, which did not enter the war until 1917, had also chosen to keep a small military force, numbering fewer than 130,000. It had built up its navy beginning in the 1890s. For the United States, keeping a small force was compatible with the isolationist tendencies it had maintained through the 1800s.

直到1917年才参战的美国也选择保留少量的军事力量，人数不足13万。它从 1890 年代开始建立海 军. 对于 美国来说，保留一支小规模部队与其在 1800 年代一直保持的孤立主义倾向相一致。

Military planners in several European countries also began designing how operations would occur in the next war. Germany anticipated that, encircled by enemies, it would have to fight on two fronts—against Russia on one side and France on the other. Developed by Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen in the early 1900s, the Schlieffen Plan held that Russia would be slow to mobilize, so Germany should use that time to attack Belgium and France and then pivot to fight Russia. This plan would make the conflict a short one. The French designed Plan XVII, which called for a major French offensive through Alsace-Lorraine to target the industrial heartland of Germany. Russia developed Plan 19, which would order Russian attacks on East Prussia once Germany was engaged against France.

几个欧洲国家的军事规划者还开始设计下一场战争的行动方式。德国预 计，在敌人的包围下，它必须在两条战线上作战——一边对抗俄罗斯，另一边对抗法国。施利芬计划 由陆军元帅阿尔弗雷德·冯·施利芬于 1900 年代初制定，认为俄罗斯的动员速度会很慢，因此德国应该 利用这段时间攻击比利时和法国，然后转向与俄罗斯作战。这个计划将使冲突变得短暂。法国制定了 第十七计划，要求法国通过阿尔萨斯-洛林发动大规模进攻，瞄准德国的工业中心地带。俄罗斯制定了 “19号计划”，一旦德国与法国交战，俄罗斯将命令俄罗斯攻击东普鲁士。(计划不如变化快，要迭代)

Yet even as the prelude to the war unfolded, most people did not truly expect conflict to be the outcome.

然而，即使战争拉开了序 幕，大多数人并没有真正预料到冲突会成为结果。

The Ottoman Empire had always been predicated on expansion.

奥斯曼帝国一直以扩张为基础。

image:/img/0051.jpg[,70%]

Starting in the 1800s, however, the Ottoman Empire entered a period of waning power as it grew unable to respond to nationalistic challenges. In the 1820s, nationalist leaders in Greece began fighting the Greek Civil War, and in 1830 Greece gained its independence from the Ottomans. More countries split off from the Empire in the 1870s, including Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria. By the end of the nineteenth century, the demise of the empire, now known as “the sick man of Europe,” was being predicted; only the timing was in question. The Ottoman Empire was no longer strong enough to hold onto its outlying areas, and these grew ever more destabilized. The other powers in Europe watched with concern as the Ottoman Empire became weaker and other countries stepped in to fill the power vacuum, occupying and administering a region but not annexing it as Ottoman influence withdrew.

然而，从 1800 年代开始，奥斯曼帝国因无力应对民族主义挑战而进入实力衰落的时期。 1820年代， 希腊民族主义领导人开始打希腊内战，1830年希腊从奥斯曼帝国手中获得独立。 1870 年代，更多国 家从帝国分裂出来，包括塞尔维亚、罗马尼亚和保加利亚。到了十九世纪末，人们就预言了这个被称 为“欧洲病夫”的帝国的灭亡。只是时间问题。奥斯曼帝国不再强大到足以控制其边远地区，这些地区变 得越来越不稳定。欧洲其他列强关切地看着奥斯曼帝国日渐衰弱，其他国家介入填补权力真空，占领 并管理一个地区，但没有随着奥斯曼影响力的撤退而吞并该地区。

The ideology of nationalism was taking hold across Europe in the 1800s, and in the 1900s it only grew. The prospect of having a country for each nationality was tantalizingly appealing: Poland for the Poles, Serbia for the Serbs, and so on. In an empire, however, nationalism was a powerful danger. Empires were built of many different nationalities, and they would disintegrate if each group were granted its own land and nation. The Ottoman Empire had already seen such pressures develop in its eastern sections, and Austria-Hungary faced this problem as well: more than ten different nationalities could be found within its borders. The concept of nationalism threatened the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s very survival.

民族主义意识形态在 1800 年代在欧洲盛行，并在 1900 年代愈演愈烈。为每个民族建立一个国家的前 景非常诱人：波兰人为波兰人，塞尔维亚为塞尔维亚人，等等。然而，在一个帝国里，民族主义是一 个强大的危险。帝国是由许多不同民族建立的，如果每个群体都拥有自己的土地和国家，帝国就会瓦 解。奥斯曼帝国的东部地区已经面临着这样的压力，奥匈帝国也面临着这个问题：其境内有十多个不 同的民族。民族主义观念威胁到了奥匈帝国的生存

The theory of pan-Slavic nationalism, which would unite all Slavic people under one rule, was a powerful one too. Slavic peoples have a shared historic culture and similar languages that include Bulgarian, Russian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovak, Czech, and Polish. They extended throughout the Balkan region and shared many of the same animosities toward the imperial powers of Austria- Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. By the twentieth century, Serbia had emerged as the leader of the pan-Slavic position in the Balkans. Its policy was characterized by hatred of Austria-Hungary and opposition to that empire’s forays into Balkan issues. Russia, too, was a Slavic nation and showed great interest in what was happening to its historic kin in the Balkans. Indeed, Russia saw itself as the natural leader of any potential pan-Slavic political entity that might emerge in the Balkans. Russia also saw Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans as rivals in the region and did not want either power to make any territorial gains. Russia hoped that by gaining influence in the Balkans, it could gain direct access to the Mediterranean Sea. Before 1914, however, Russia was not prepared to risk war to maintain this stance.

将所有斯拉夫人民团结在一个统治之下的泛斯拉夫民族主义理论也是一种强大的理论。斯拉夫民族有 着共同的历史文化和相似的语言，包括保加利亚语、俄语、克罗地亚语、塞尔维亚语、斯洛伐克语、 捷克语和波兰语。他们遍布整个巴尔干地区，对奥匈帝国和奥斯曼帝国的帝国主义列强有着许多相同 的敌意。到了二十世纪，塞尔维亚已成为巴尔干地区泛斯拉夫立场的领导者。其政策的特点是对奥匈 帝国的仇恨和反对该帝国介入巴尔干问题。俄罗斯也是一个斯拉夫国家，对其巴尔干地区历史上的同 胞所发生的事情表现出极大的兴趣。事实上，俄罗斯认为自己是巴尔干地区可能出现的任何潜在泛斯 拉夫政治实体的天然领导者。俄罗斯还将奥匈帝国和奥斯曼帝国视为该地区的竞争对手，并且不希望 任何一个国家获得任何领土利益。俄罗斯希望通过在巴尔干地区获得影响力，能够直接进入地中海。 然而，在 1914 年之前，俄罗斯并不准备冒战争的风险来维持这一立场。

Serbia turned to its ally Russia. Appealing to the Slavic heritage of both nations, Serbian leaders extracted a promise that Russia would come to their aid if Austria-Hungary attacked. Austria-Hungary turned to its longtime ally Germany for a show of support.

塞尔维亚向盟友俄罗斯求助。塞尔维亚领导人利用两国的斯拉夫传统，获得了一个承诺，即如果奥匈帝国进攻，俄罗斯将向他们提供援助。奥匈帝国择向其长 期盟友德国寻求支持。

It was becoming clear that if war broke out, it would pull into it many countries bound by their treaty obligations to one another.

越来越明显的是，如果战争爆发，许多受条约 义务约束的国家就会卷入战争。

奥匈帝国在塞尔维亚未能满足奥地利最后通牒的要求后，于 1914 年 7 月 28 日对塞尔维亚宣战。俄罗斯于 7 月 30 日下令动员军队予以回应。德国现在发现自己无论愿意与否 都被卷入了战斗，于 8 月 1 日向俄罗斯宣战并下令全面动员。随后，法国下令进行总动员，部分原因 是它受到与俄罗斯的条约条款的约束，但也因为它担心动员起来的德国可能会对它做什么，因为它牢 记着普法战争的记忆。事实证明，法国的担忧是正确的。

Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914, after Serbia failed to meet the demands of the Austrian ultimatum. Russia ordered mobilization of its troops on July 30 in response. Germany now found itself pulled into the fight whether it wanted to be or not, declaring war on Russia on August 1 and ordering full mobilization. France then ordered its own general mobilization, partly because it was bound to by treaty terms with Russia but also because it feared what a mobilized Germany might do to it, with memories of the Franco-Prussian War in mind. As it turned out, France was right to be apprehensive.

The military planners in Germany had been readying for war for many years in the absence of any actual combat. The Schlieffen Plan for fighting a short, two-front war had been continuously amended after its initial development, but in 1914 its basic form still rested on the belief that Russia would be slow to mobilize and unable to field troops for many weeks after a declaration of war. Since Germany was prepared for immediate mobilization, it would use these weeks to attack France and capture Paris, causing France’s surrender (as it had in 1871), and then it would turn its troops to fight Russia.

德国的军事策划者在没有任何实战的情况下已经为战争做好了多年的准备。打一场短期的两条战线战 争的施利芬计划在最初制定后不断修改，但1914年其基本形式仍然基于这样的信念：俄罗斯在宣战后 数周内将缓慢动员且无法部署军队战争的。由于德国做好了立即动员的准备，它将利用这几周的时间 攻击法国并占领巴黎，导致法国投降（就像1871年那样），然后调集军队与俄罗斯作战。

The expectation of a short war was not just on Germany’s side. Other countries also believed in 1914 that even if a war broke out that summer, the troops would be home by Christmas.

对一场短暂战争的预期并不只是德国一方。 1914年，其他国家也相信，即使那年夏天爆发战争，军队 也会在圣诞节前回国。

Germany’s plan for war on France called for moving westward and then sweeping south to head for Paris. To do this, the German armies would need to march across the country of Belgium. But the King of Belgium declined. In 1839, the German Confederation (the predecessor of Germany) as well as other countries in Europe had been signatories to a treaty that guaranteed the independence of Belgium. The king believed that allowing Germany entrance would undermine its independence, and he could not allow that.

德国对法战争的计划要求先向西推进，然后向南横扫巴黎。为此，德国军队需要穿越比利时全国。但比 利时国王拒绝了。 1839年，德意志联邦（德国的前身）和欧洲其他国家签署了一项保证比利时独立的 条约。国王认为允许德国加入会损害其独立性，他不能允许这种情况发生

The German armies entered anyway but were immensely frustrated by their slow progress and Belgium’s obstinacy.

德国军队无论如何都进入了，但由于进展缓慢和比利时的顽固而感到非常沮丧

These weeks, more than any others, shaped the world’s perception of the war and of Germany. The “Rape of Belgium” cast Germany as an aggressor nation that behaved inhumanely in war. It fed the propaganda machines of the Allies, the nations that united to oppose Germany and Austria-Hungary and originally consisted of Russia, France, and Britain.

这几周比其他任何时候都更影响了世界对战争和德国的看法。 “掠夺比利时”将德国描绘成一个在战争 中表现不人道的侵略国。它为同盟国的宣传机器提供了动力，这些国家联合起来反对德国和奥匈帝 国，最初由俄罗斯、法国和英国组成。

The Battle of the Marne in September 1914 created front lines where a stalemate lasted several years as both sides dug a trench system from which to fight. Given an information blackout due to government censors, rumors about the threat to Paris were rampant. Approximately 800,000 people left the city, anticipating a German invasion.

(德法之间) 1914 年 9 月的马恩河战役造成了前线 的僵局持续了数年，双方都挖了战壕系统进行战斗。由于政府审查造 成信息封锁，有关巴黎受到威胁的谣言甚嚣尘上。由于预计德国会入侵，大约 80 万人离开了这座城 市。

In the east, Germany found itself facing the Russians in battle much earlier than expected.

在东部，德国发现自己与俄罗斯的交战比预期早得多。

The naval power of Great Britain was soon brought to bear. The British instituted a blockade of German ports that made it exceedingly difficult for Germany to import the goods it needed. The country’s industrial strength helped it survive this blockade for a good portion of the war, but by its last year, shortages were being felt by every German family. Its navy was not large enough to implement a retaliatory blockade against Britain.

英国的海军力量很快就发挥了作用。英国对德国港口实施封锁，使德国进口所需货物变得极其困难。 该国的工业实力帮助它在战争的大部分时间里度过了封锁，但到了去年，每个德国家庭都感受到了短 缺。德国的海军规模不足以对英国实施报复性封锁

In Asia, the coming of the war caused nations to take sides. The Japanese Empire, emboldened by its success against Russia less than a decade earlier in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), saw the opportunity to increase its standing in the world and sided with the Allies. Japanese forces attacked the German colonial port at Qingdao (Tsingtao), a city on the Chinese coast that Germany had held for less than twenty years as the planned headquarters of its Asian empire.

在亚洲，战争的到来导致各国选边站队。日本帝国在不到十年前的日俄战争（1904-1905）中对俄罗斯 的成功受到鼓舞，看到了提高其世界地位的机会，并站在同盟国一边。日本军队袭击了位于中国沿海 的德国殖民港口青岛，德国将其作为其亚洲帝国的计划总部据点不到二十年。

The Allies rejected offers of military troops from China at the beginning of the war. By 1916, however, the situation had changed, and Britain and France allowed Chinese laborers to come to Europe. China had been willing to send combat troops, hoping to gain leverage in treaty negotiations after the war and support for ousting Japan from its borders, but Japan, which had taken control of Qingdao and hoped to establish itself as the unquestioned military power in Asia, would not permit it. Thus, approximately 130,000 Chinese laborers arrived in Europe, to repair equipment and dig trenches but not to fight.

战争初期，同盟国拒绝了中国派遣军队的提议。然而到了1916年，情况发生了变化，英国和法国允许 中国劳工来到欧洲。中国一直愿意派遣作战部队，希望在战后条约谈判中获得筹码，并支持将日本赶 出边境，但控制了青岛并希望将自己打造成亚洲无可争议的军事强国的日本，不会允许的。因此，大 约13万名中国劳工抵达欧洲，是为了修理设备和挖战壕，而不是参加战斗。

Isolationism had been a consistent practice of U.S. foreign policy, and the United States planned to maintain it, while at the same time selling products to both the Allied powers of Britain and France and the Central powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. It was clear from the outset, however, that “the vast majority of American trade went to the Allies,” partly because of Britain’s substantial role in U.S. naval, merchant, and credit operations but also because the British blockade made it difficult for anyone to trade with Germany. U.S. banks were soon extending loans and lines of credit to both sides as well, although approximately $2 billion had been extended to the Allies by the spring of 1917 and a mere $27 million to the Central powers.

孤立主义一直是美国外交政策的一贯做法，美国计划维持这一做法，同时向英法同盟国以及德国和奥 匈帝国等同盟国出售产品。然而，从一开始就很明显，“美国的绝大多数贸易都流向了盟国”，部分原因 是英国在美国海军、商业和信贷业务中发挥着重要作用，但也因为英国的封锁使任何人都很难与德国 的贸易。美国银行很快也向双方提供贷款和信贷额度，尽管到 1917 年春天已向同盟国提供了约 20 亿 美元，而向同盟国提供的贷款和信贷额度仅为 2,700 万美元。

Among the American public, there was little support for or interest in entering this European war. Not hampered by censorship of the news as the combatant powers were, American readers could easily learn about the casualty numbers and the horror of the war.

在美国公众中，几乎没有人支持或有兴趣参与这场欧洲战争。美国读者不像交战国那样受到新闻审查 的阻碍，可以轻松了解战争的伤亡数字和恐怖。

However, his commitment to the freedom of the seas and the rights of neutral nations in times of war soon put him on a collision course with Germany.

然而，他(美国伍德罗·威尔逊总统)对战争时期海洋自由和中立国家权利的承诺很快使他与德国发生了冲突。

Military technology had changed greatly by the beginning of the twentieth century, and these changes were not often understood or appreciated by either soldiers or commanders when the war broke out. The recent spread of industrialization meant that more weapons with greater firepower could now be turned out of factories.

到二十世纪初，军事技术发生了巨大变化，而战争爆发时，士兵或指挥官往往不理解或重视这些变 化。最近工业化的蔓延意味着更多火力更强的武器现在可以从工厂生产出来。

Different types of gas were used. Chlorine gas with its greenish hue appeared early in the war, thick and heavy mustard gas came later, and phosgene was used throughout the combat. Mustard gas could burn the eyes, nose, and skin with injuries that took weeks to heal; for the unlucky, it could cause permanent blindness and lifelong respiratory problems, and sometimes death. Phosgene gas was colorless and could be more immediately deadly, through symptoms might not appear for many hours. Historians estimate that 85 percent of deaths from gassing were due to the effects of phosgene.

。使用了不同类型的毒气。战争初期出现了绿色的氯气，后来出现了浓重的芥子 气，整个战斗过程中都使用了光气。芥子气可能会烧伤眼睛、鼻子和皮肤，造成的伤口需要数周时间 才能愈合；对于不幸的人来说，它可能会导致永久性失明和终生呼吸系统问题，有时甚至导致死亡。 光气是无色的，可能会立即致命，但症状可能要几个小时后才会出现。历史学家估计，85% 的毒气死 亡是由于光气的影响造成的。

Physical wounds were fairly straightforward for doctors and nurses to tackle. The psychological wounds were much more problematic. Doctors began diagnosing cases of “shell shock” early in the war. Shell shock went by other names in later wars, such as battle fatigue and, today, post-traumatic stress disorder. Some symptoms were mild, like a shaking hand or constant twitch. Others were more serious, including flashbacks to battle, inability to speak, loss of contact with reality, or fear of any unexpected sound. Those dealing with shell shock often had to be sent to hospitals far from the frontlines, and recovery was exceedingly slow as psychologists tried to help them reenter peacetime society.

对于医生和护士来说，处理身体伤口相当简单。心理创伤的问题要严重得多。战争初期，医生们就开始诊断“炮弹休克”病例，。在后来的战争中，炮弹休克症 有其他名称，例如战斗疲劳，以及今天的创伤后应激障碍。有些症状很轻微，例如手颤抖或持续抽 搐。其他人的情况则更为严重，包括回忆起战斗、无法说话、与现实失去联系，或者害怕任何意外的 声音。那些患有炮弹休克症的人往往不得不被送往远离前线的医院，而且当心理学家试图帮助他们重 新融入和平时期的社会时，他们的康复速度也极其缓慢。

The compromise did allow the United States to remain neutral even as tensions mounted. But in 1917, the terms changed. Germany announced in January of that year that it would engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. This meant that any ship in a war zone was a target for sinking even if it were sailing under the flag of a neutral power, so U.S. merchant ships were now subject to being torpedoed.

这一妥协确实让美国在紧张局势加剧的情况下保持中立。但到了 1917 年，条款发生了变化。德国于当 年一月宣布将进行无限制潜艇战。这意味着战区的任何船只即使是悬挂中立国旗帜的船只也会成为被 击沉的目标，因此美国商船现在很容易遭到鱼雷袭击。

Germany made this decision because it felt that Britain would be forced to pull out of the war if the lifeline of cargo coming to it from the United States were cut off. Germany had suffered food shortages beginning in 1915. By 1917, as a result of the British blockade and the enlistment of male farm laborers for war, the nation’s urban population was starving, and its troops were on reduced rations. Unless Britain withdrew from the war soon, Germany would be forced to surrender. Obviously, Germany knew this decision would anger the United States and could well cause it to enter the war itself, but it was a gamble its leaders were prepared to take. They fully believed that Germany could achieve victory if it could force the British to surrender before the United States could enter the war.

德国做出这一决定是因为它认为，如果从美国运往德国的货物生命线被切断，英国将被迫退出战争。 德国从 1915 年开始就遭遇粮食短缺。到 1917 年，由于英国的封锁和征召男性农场工人参加战争，该 国的城市人口陷入饥饿，军队的口粮也减少。除非英国尽快退出战争，否则德国将被迫投降。显然， 德国知道这一决定会激怒美国，并很可能导致其自己参战，但这是其领导人准备进行的一场赌博。他 们坚信，如果德国能够在美国参战之前迫使英国投降，德国就能取得胜利。

Further exacerbating tensions between Germany and the United States was the publication on March 1, 1917, of the Zimmermann Telegram. This message had been sent to Mexico by Germany’s foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, offering a deal. Germany wanted the Mexican government, in the event of war with the United States, to actively cause more disturbances along the border, keeping even more U.S. troops there and thus unavailable for deployment to Europe. In return for Mexico’s cooperation, upon its victory, Germany would grant it the region of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, territory it had lost in 1848 as a result of war with the United States.

1917 年 3 月 1 日发布的齐默尔曼电报进一步加剧了德国和美国之间的紧张关系。该信息是由德国外交 部长阿瑟·齐默尔曼发送给墨西哥的，提出了一项协议。德 国希望墨西哥政府在与美国发生战争时，积极在边境制造更多骚乱，让更多的美军留在那里，从而无 法部署到欧洲。作为对墨西哥合作的回报，在墨西哥获胜后，德国将把得克萨斯州、新墨西哥州和亚 利桑那州地区交给墨西哥，这些领土是墨西哥在 1848 年与美国战争中失去的领土。

U.S. banks, which realized the loans they had extended to the European Allies would go unpaid if Germany won, already supported their country’s involvement, as did businesses that hoped U.S. assistance would encourage the Allies to grant them greater access to global markets.

美国的银行意识 到，如果德国获胜，它们向欧洲盟国提供的贷款将无法偿还，因此已经支持美国的参与，希望美国的 援助能够鼓励盟国给予它们更多进入全球市场的机会的企业也是如此。

In April 1917, the United States entered the conflict on the side of the Allied powers.

1917 年 4 月，美国站在同盟国一边加入 了冲突。

The trenches of the western front, born of the stalemate in which the Allies and Central powers found themselves in the fall of 1914, became synonymous with the war.

1914 年秋，盟军和同盟国陷入僵局，西线的战壕成为战争的代名词。

It rained regularly, and the trenches became filled with mud. Constant moisture on feet and legs caused trench foot when the skin could not dry and began to split and come off.

经常下雨，战 壕里充满了泥土。当脚和腿上的皮肤无 法干燥并开始裂开和脱落时，脚和腿上的持续潮湿会导致战壕足

The ANZAC forces representing Australia and New Zealand saw heavy action in the Mediterranean in 1915. The idea behind the British plan was to launch a ship-based artillery attack at the Dardanelles and then land troops on a peninsula called Gallipoli. This would allow the British to link up with Russian forces and coordinate a push against the Turks to isolate the Ottoman Empire and seize control of the important Turkish straits leading to the Sea of Marmara (Figure 11.14). The brainchild of Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, the operation suffered problems from its start in February. The first ships took heavy fire and were crippled by mines. The Turks were prepared for a ground invasion and began firing on the Allied troops from secure positions. Those who made it ashore were unable to do more than establish beachheads and did not drive far into the interior. The situation continued through all of 1915 before the British decided to evacuate their troops. Casualties from both sides totaled approximately 900,000, losses commemorated in Australia and New Zealand each year on ANZAC Day, April 25. Churchill resigned over the debacle.

(各国的殖民地, 也被动员起来加入战争.) 1915年，代表澳大利亚和新西兰的澳新军团在地中海采取了大规模行动。英国计划背后的想法 是对达达尼尔海峡发动舰载炮击，然后在一个名为加利波利的半岛上登陆。这将使英国能够与俄罗斯 军队联合起来，协调打击土耳其人，孤立奥斯曼帝国，并夺取通往马尔马拉海的重要土耳其海峡的控 制权。该行动是时任第一海军大臣温斯顿·丘吉尔的创意，从二月份开始就遇到了问题。 第一批船只遭到猛烈火力攻击并被水雷损坏。土耳其人做好了地面入侵的准备，并开始从安全位置向 盟军开火。那些登上岸的人除了建立滩头阵地外什么也做不了，也没有深入内陆地区。这种情况持续 了整个 1915 年，直到英国决定撤离军队。双方伤亡总计约 90 万人，澳大利亚和新西兰每年都会在 4 月 25 日澳新军团日纪念损失。丘吉尔因这次惨败而辞职。

Prejudice and discrimination were widely evident within the major powers in the war. The multitude of nationalities that fought in this war meant that people were regularly engaging with allies from different backgrounds and ethnicities. The prospect of tension in these relationships was clear.

战争中的主要大国内部普遍存在偏见和歧视。。参加这场战争的民族众多，这意味着人们经常与 来自不同背景和种族的盟友接触。这些关系中紧张的前景是显而易见的。

Many national governments coped unsuccessfully with financing the war. Generally, less than a third of the cost was paid through taxation. Instead, borrowing by selling war bonds to the public, printing more money, and taking on more debt became the main method of paying for the war. Price inflation hit new highs as the combination of debt, the printing of money, and product shortages squeezed civilian budgets.

许多国家政府未能成功地为战争提供资金。一般来说，不到三分之一的成本是通过税收支付的。相 反，通过向公众出售战争债券来借贷、印更多的钱、承担更多的债务成为支付战争费用的主要方法。 由于债务、印钞和产品短缺挤压了民间预算，物价通胀创下新高。(钱多物少，肯定通胀)

As the British army found itself in need of more troops, it began active recruitment campaigns. One popular tactic tried in the first half of the war was the development of “pals” units. Young men would sign up together and be guaranteed assignment to the same unit, a unit of their pals. While certainly an enticement to serve, this method of organizing units also meant that neighborhoods and villages might see nearly all their young men wounded or killed in the same engagement. The practice was discontinued after the high-casualty Somme campaign in 1916.

当英国军队发现自己需要更多的军队时，它开始积极的招募活动。战争前半段尝试的一种流行策略是 发展“伙伴”部队。年轻人会一起报名，并保证被分配到同一个单位，即他们朋友的单位。虽然这无疑是 一种服役的诱惑，但这种组织部队的方法也意味着社区和村庄可能会看到几乎所有的年轻人在同一次 战斗中受伤或死亡。 1916 年伤亡惨重的索姆河战役后，这种做法就停止了。

As more men set off to fight, women in many countries found job opportunities in traditionally male-oriented fields.

越来越多的男性参战，许多国家的女性在传统上以男性为主的领域找到了工作机 会

The sense of independence and the novelty of making their own money spurred many women involved in the war effort to see political reform and voting rights as the next step. For example, many women in Britain viewed the extension of voting rights as a way to reward them for their war work. Suffragists had been protesting for years about the need to include women among the voting population in numerous countries such as Britain, Germany, and the United States. In 1918, Britain extended the right to vote to property-owning women over thirty. Germany gave women the vote in 1918, the first country to grant universal adult female suffrage, as did the United States in 1920.

独立感和自己赚钱的新鲜感促使许多参与战争的女性将政治改革和投票权视为下一步。例如，许多英 国女性将投票权的扩大视为奖励她们战争工作的一种方式。在英国、德国和美国等许多国家，妇女参 政论者多年来一直抗议将女性纳入投票人口的必要性。 1918年，英国将投票权扩大到30岁以上的有产 女性。德国于 1918 年赋予妇女选举权，是第一个给予成年女性普选权的国家，美国于 1920 年也是如 此。

Britain was particularly vulnerable to shortages because it imported approximately 60 percent of its food.

英国特别容易受到短缺的影响，因为大约 60% 的食品依赖进口。

Civilian discontent also rose as more young men were needed for the armies. The war dragged on, and the early enthusiasm evidenced by young recruits in 1914 disappeared. Some recruits did not have confidence that the national armies would be able to win battles or that it was worth risking their lives in service. Other young men were conscientious objectors who for religious and philosophical reasons did not believe in fighting wars and therefore did not wish to serve. Some would-be soldiers in the empires increasingly questioned the value of fighting for imperial glory.

随着军队需要更多的年轻人，平民的不满情绪也随之上升。战争一拖再拖，1914 年年轻新兵的早期热 情消失了。一些新兵不相信国家军队能够赢得战斗，也不相信值得冒着生命危险服役。其他年轻人是 出于良心拒服兵役的人，他们出于宗教和哲学原因不相信打仗，因此不想服役。一些想要成为帝国士 兵的人越来越质疑为帝国荣耀而战的价值。

The use of censorship became a common tool to manage civilian discontent by limiting the information distributed about the war effort. Newspapers presented only vague descriptions of battles and losses, and government-sponsored propaganda showed civilians pro-war posters and commentary. Censorship efforts began in all combatant nations in 1914 and expanded to the United States when it entered in the war in 1917.

审查制度的使用成为通过限制有关战争努力的信息传播来管理平民不满情绪的常用工具。报纸仅对战 斗和损失进行模糊描述，政府资助的宣传则向平民展示支持战争的海报和评论。审查制度于 1914 年开 始在所有交战国进行，并在 1917 年美国参战时扩大到美国。

The U.S. government’s effort to squash criticism of the war began in 1917 with the Espionage Act. It set limits on what could be mailed, banning any type of anti-war newspaper or pamphlet. In 1918, Congress passed the Sedition Act. This forbade “disloyal, profane, scurrilous, and abusive” language about the decision to enter the war, the draft, the flag, and armed forces’ uniforms. It was not about what might be true, but about what could be seen as disloyal. Anti-war speech was considered disloyal and therefore seditious. People were unable to openly question why the United States was in the war or speak out against it without risking imprisonment or hefty fines. Today we see the Sedition Act as a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which promises protections for free speech. Despite this, the Supreme Court upheld the act.

美国政府于 1917 年通过《间谍法》开始努力压制对战争的批评。它对邮寄物品进行了限制，禁止任何 类型的反战报纸或小册子。 1918年，国会通过了《煽动叛乱法》 。该法案禁止在参战决定、征兵、国 旗和武装部队制服方面使用“不忠诚、亵渎、粗俗和辱骂”的语言。这不是关于什么可能是真实的，而是 关于什么可能被视为不忠诚。反战言论被认为是不忠诚的，因此具有煽动性。人们无法公开质疑美国 为何卷入战争，也无法公开反对战争，否则就会面临监禁或巨额罚款的风险。今天，我们认为《煽动 叛乱法》违反了美国宪法第一修正案，该修正案承诺保护言论自由。尽管如此，最高法院还是维持了 该法案.

Poets published work that put the inhumanity and suffering of the war on full display. No heroic charges were celebrated in their stanzas.

诗人的作品充分展现了战争的不人道和苦难。他们的诗节中没有 庆祝英雄的冲锋。

Due to the use of aircraft in the war, civilians in Europe also had the experience of being displaced from their own cities. Those who survived the destruction of their homes became refugees in their own country.

由于战争中飞机的使用，欧洲的平民也有过逃离自己城市的经历。那些在家园被毁后幸存下来的人成为了自己国家的难民。

Refugees emerged all over Europe. By the end of 1914, more than three million people in France and Belgium alone had left their homes. While many were eventually able to return, the problem of housing millions of displaced people continued throughout the war. On the eastern front, Jewish citizens fled their homes by the tens of thousands, and many found themselves further east in Russia than had previously been allowed due to anti-Semitic laws.

欧洲各地出现了难民。到 1914 年底，仅法国和比利时就有超过 300 万人离开家园。虽然许多人最终得 以返回，但数百万流离失所者的住房问题在整个战争期间持续存在。在东部战线，数以万计的犹太公 民逃离家园，许多人发现自己身处俄罗斯，比之前反犹太法所允许的地方更远。

On January 5, 1905, many workers gathered to protest peacefully outside Tsar Nicholas II’s Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. They were led by a local cleric and appealed to the tsar (who was not in residence) for improvements to their working conditions, as well as a government that would share power with a popularly elected assembly.

1905年1月5日，许多工人聚集在圣彼得堡沙皇尼古拉二世冬宫外进行和平抗议。他们由当地一名神职 人员领导，呼吁沙皇（当时不在居住地）改善他们的工作条件，并呼吁建立一个与民选议会分享权力 的政府。

Workers in numerous cities went on strike to protest the bloodshed as part of the Revolution of 1905. Many strikes turned violent as more troops were ordered to put them down. With no end in sight, Nicholas II was forced to concede that he would no longer rule autocratically, and that a national legislature would meet to create a new voice in the government. The legislature was called the Duma and first met in 1906. It was composed of middleclass men and peasants, but it had two houses. One was indirectly chosen by an electoral college whose members were selected by men over age twenty-five. The other house had members appointed by the tsar. This second house dominated the Duma, limiting the legislature’s ability to function as a true representative assembly. While it was a step forward in line with some revolutionary aims, it did not signal a true sharing of power by the tsar.

作为 1905 年革命的一部分，许多城市的工人举行罢工，抗议流血事件。 许多罢工演变为暴力，因为更多的军队被命令镇压。由于看不到尽头，尼古拉二世被迫承认他将不再 实行独裁统治，国家立法机构将开会在政府中发出新的声音。立法机关称为杜马，于 1906 年首次召 开。它由中产阶级男子和农民组成，但有两院。其中一名是由选举团间接选出的，选举团成员由二十 五岁以上的男性选出。另一院的成员由沙皇任命。第二议院主导了杜马，限制了立法机关作为真正的 代表议会发挥作用的能力。虽然这是符合某些革命目标的一步，但这并不意味着沙皇真正分享权力。

The soldiers formed the Petrograd Soviet (a council representing workers, soldiers, and peasants) to establish power in the city. A group of moderate politicians then established a new government for Russia under the auspices of the Duma. This provisional government was led by Alexander Kerensky, a lawyer who had become popular for assisting revolutionaries in the past. Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate, paving the way for the end of three hundred years of Romanov rule.

士兵们组建了彼得格勒苏维埃（代表工人、士兵和农民的委员会）以在该市建立政权。随后，一群温 和派政治家在杜马的主持下成立了俄罗斯新政府。这个临时政府由亚历山大·克伦斯基（Alexander Kerensky）领导，他是一位过去因协助革命者而广受欢迎的律师。沙皇尼古拉二世被迫退位，为罗曼 诺夫三百年统治的结束铺平了道路。

Kerensky was dedicated to continuing Russia’s participation in World War I, partly because he feared that aid he needed from the West to support Russia’s economy would be lost if he withdrew from the conflict. However, this position became increasingly unpopular with the Russian people. The provisional government and the Petrograd Soviet (which was becoming more anti-war) then vied for power in Russia.

克伦斯基致力于让俄罗斯继续参与第一次世界大战，部分原因是他担心，如果他退出冲突，他将失去 西方支持俄罗斯经济所需的援助。然而，这一立场越来越不受俄罗斯人民的欢迎。随后，临时政府和 彼得格勒苏维埃（变得更加反战）争夺俄罗斯的权力。

Germany saw an opportunity to take advantage of Russia’s disintegrating political situation. A young Russian named Vladimir Ilyich Lenin had supported the cause of revolution in his native country for many years. Lenin had then left Russia, branded a radical and forced into exile. Germany helped him return to Russia to energize the revolution there and undermine the tsarist government’s conduct of the war.

德国看到了利用俄罗斯分崩离析的政治局势的机会(德国最好希望俄罗斯退出与自己的战争呢)。。一位名叫弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的俄罗斯青年多 年来一直支持祖国的革命事业。随后 列宁离开俄罗斯，被贴上激进分子的标签并被迫流亡。德国帮助他回到俄罗斯，激发那里的革命并破 坏沙皇政府的战争行为。

Lenin quickly became the leader of the revolutionary cause, and the group he led, the Bolsheviks, challenged Kerensky’s provisional government. In the October Revolution in 1917, Lenin led a coup and seized power from the other political factions in Petrograd.

Capitalizing on a campaign of “Peace, Land, Bread,” Lenin’s government moved to end the war with Germany. Germany was only too happy to work out an agreement that would allow it to focus solely on the war on its western front.

列宁很快成为革命事业的领袖，他领导的布尔什维克集团向克伦斯基的 临时政府发起挑战。 1917年十月革命，列宁领导政变，从彼得格勒其他政治派别手中夺取了政权。列宁政府利用“和平、土地、面包”运动结束了与德国的战争。 德国非常高兴能够达成一项协议，使其能够专注于西部战线的战争。

Lenin’s goal was to end the fighting as quickly as possible, so he agreed to terms that were fairly advantageous for Germany and the Central powers. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on March 3, 1918. In it, Russia gave up significant territory to the Central powers, including areas of Poland and Ukraine, Finland, and the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia), which gave Germany new ports. In return, Russia was able to end its participation in the war as Lenin focused on building a Communist state, the Soviet Union.

列宁的目标是尽快结束战斗，因此他同意了对德国和同盟国相当有利的条件。 1918 年 3 月 3 日签署了 《布列斯特-立托夫斯克条约》。在该条约中，俄罗斯将大片领土让给同盟国，包括波兰和乌克兰、芬 兰以及波罗的海国家（立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚）的地区。给了德国新的港口。作为 回报，俄罗斯得以结束对战争的参与，因为列宁专注于建设共产主义国家苏联。

In 1918, after being held under house arrest for two years, the former tsar, his wife, and their five children were executed. A civil war broke out that year pitting the White Army, which opposed Lenin, against the Red Army, which supported the Bolshevik government. This conflict lasted until 1923, when the Red Army proved victorious.

1918年，在被软禁两年后，前沙皇、他的妻子和他们的五个孩子被处决。那年爆发了一场内战，反对 列宁的白军与支持布尔什维克政府的红军之间展开了斗争。这场冲突一直持续到1923年，红军取得了 胜利。

By the summer of 1918, these successes meant that Germany held more territory than at any time in the past. In that same summer, however, the mass of U.S. troops finally arrived.

。到 1918 年夏天，这些胜利意味着德国拥有比过去任何时候都多的领 土。然而，同年夏天，大批美军终于抵达。

The situation for Germany was bleak. Food shortages were causing widespread panic and despair. Troops began deserting, and civil unrest spread throughout Germany and Austria-Hungary. German naval commanders wanted to achieve one last moment of glory by sailing the fleet out in late October to engage the British. The German sailors, however, knew there was no chance of victory and had no wish to go on a suicide mission. About one thousand of them mutinied and refused to set sail. In Kiel, home to a major German naval base, both sailors and workers refused to follow orders. The revolt soon spread to other cities.

德国的形势十分严峻。粮食短缺引起了广泛的恐慌和绝望。军队开始开小差，内乱蔓延到整个德国和 奥匈帝国。德国海军指挥官希望在 10 月下旬派遣舰队出海与英国交战，从而获得最后的荣耀。然而， 德国水手们知道没有胜利的机会，也不想执行自杀式任务。其中约有一千人叛变并拒绝起航。在德国 主要海军基地所在地基尔，水手和工人都拒绝服从命令。叛乱很快蔓延到其他城市。

In Berlin, the far-left Socialist Party’s politicians seized on the burgeoning revolt as a way to force a major change in the government and restore order. They called for the abdication of the Kaiser and the establishment of a republic. Wilhelm II abdicated on November 9, 1918, leaving the country for the Netherlands where he lived until his death in 1941. The civilian political leaders of the more moderate Social Democrats now proclaimed a provisional government, making Germany a republic. The German military agreed to work under this new civilian government. Political leaders then took up the negotiations that had already begun for an armistice, or cease-fire agreement, with the Allies. They believed Germany could not win the war and was best served by ending it. This maneuver helped isolate the socialist radicals.

在柏林，极左翼社会党的政客们抓住了迅速兴起的叛乱，以此迫使政府进行重大变革并恢复秩序。他 们呼吁德皇退位并建立共和国。威廉二世于 1918 年 11 月 9 日退位，离开国家前往荷兰，并在那里居 住直至 1941 年去世。较为温和的社会民主党的文职政治领导人现在宣布成立临时政府，使德国成为一 个共和国。德国军方同意在新的文职政府领导下工作。随后，政治领导人开始与盟军进行已经开始的 停战或停火协议谈判。他们认为德国无法赢得战争，结束战争对德国来说是最好的选择。这一策略有 助于孤立社会主义激进分子。

Austria came to terms on an armistice on November 3, 1918, and Hungary followed on November 13. For Germany, an armistice was set to go into effect on November 11 at 11:00 a.m., imposing a cease-fire on all units.

The decision by the Allies to request an armistice instead of a surrender was important. A surrender meant that one side had to accept defeat. This was not something Germany was prepared to do in 1918. The armistice, however, simply meant that a cease-fire would be imposed while formal negotiations occurred. Germany believed these negotiations would allow it to preserve some of its gains in the war and extract itself from the fighting with a measure of honor and dignity.

奥地利于 1918 年 11 月 3 日签署停战协议，匈牙利于 11 月 13 日签署停战协议。对于德国来说，停战 协议定于 11 月 11 日上午 11:00 生效，所有单位停火。盟军请求停战而不是投降的决定 非常重要。投降意味着一方必须接受失败。这并不是德国在 1918 年准备做的事情。然而，停战协定只 是意味着在进行正式谈判时实行停火。德国相信，这些谈判将使其能够保留在战争中的一些成果，并 以一定程度的荣誉和尊严退出战斗。

By the 1930s, economic instability had become common as the Great Depression plunged nations into poverty and unemployment. Governments dealt with the downturn in a variety of ways, but solutions in several countries included more authoritarian policies.

到了 20 世纪 30 年代，大萧条使 各国陷入贫困和失业，经济不稳定变得普遍。各国政府以多种方式应对经济衰退，但一些国家的解决 方案包括更加专制的政策。

Two major and competing forces took shape following World War I. One was disillusionment as the sheer horror of the war was finally understood. The other was the tantalizing idea that society had learned from the war and could build a better tomorrow, freed from the senselessness of war, through new institutions such as the League of Nations. Or, in the case of Russia, a new society would be based on more equitable principles. The reality turned out to be far from the ideal.

第一次世界大战后，形成了两股相互竞争的主要力量。第一股力量是幻想破灭，因为人们终于明白了战争的纯粹恐怖。另一个是诱人的想法，即社会从战争中吸取了教训，可以通过国际联盟等新机构建设一个 更美好的明天，摆脱战争的无意义。或者，就俄罗斯而言，一个新社会将建立在更公平的原则之上。 事实证明，现实与理想相差甚远。

The war also brought into question the notions of superiority that had permeated Western civilization. People wondered whether the West was declining and could no longer consider itself a moral leader in the world.

这场战争(即一战)还对渗透到西方文明中的优越感提出了质疑。 人们想知道西方是否正在衰落，不再认为自己是世界的道德领袖。

Even the victorious nations faced economic problems. Britain and France had borrowed billions to finance the war and had sizable debts to repay, many to the United States.

。即使是战胜国也面临着经济问题。英国和法国借了数十亿美元来资 助战争，并有大量债务需要偿还，其中许多债务是美国的。

The Treaty of Versailles 凡尔赛条约

In January 1919, the leaders of the major Allied powers (except Russia) met outside Paris at Versailles to negotiate the treaty formally ending the war (Figure 12.4). Committees were assigned to resolve the many issues concerning not only Europe but also the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The conference lasted about a year. In its finished form, the Treaty of Versailles was actually a series of treaties.

1919年1月，主要同盟国（俄罗斯除外）领导人在巴黎郊外的凡尔赛宫会面，谈判正式结束战争的条约 。委员会被指派解决不仅涉及欧洲而且还涉及中东、非洲和亚洲的许多问题。会议持续了 大约一年。 《凡尔赛条约》的最终版本实际上是一系列条约

In January 1918, he had already published a plan he hoped would be the basis of the treaty—the Fourteen Points—embodying his wish to prevent future war by solving issues he believed had led to the recent conflict. Among these points were the rights of neutral nations, freedom of the seas, and the need to break up the empires that had caused the war and create new sovereign states in Europe. Wilson’s last point proposed a League of Nations where member nations could come together for mutual security and work out problems without resorting to war.

1918 年 1 月，他(美国伍德罗·威尔逊 ( Woodrow Wilson) 总统)已经公布了一项计划，希望成为该条约的基础—— “十四点” ——体现了他通过解决他认为 导致最近冲突的问题来防止未来战争的愿望。其中包括中立国家的权利、海洋自由，以及瓦解引发战 争的帝国并在欧洲建立新主权国家的必要性。威尔逊的最后一点提出建立国际联盟，成员国可以为了 共同安全而聚集在一起，在不诉诸战争的情况下解决问题。

Wilson also strongly advocated self-determination, the idea that each ethnic group should have its own government. The treaty ushered in a major redrawing of Europe, and new countries flooded onto the map. Their borders were drawn by diplomats in Paris, however, and did not always reflect where people of different nationalities lived. Nor could they. In an already diverse empire such as Austria- Hungary, people of different backgrounds lived side by side, so it was no easy feat to draw a border.

威尔逊还大力提倡自决，即每个民族都应该有自己的政府。该条约带来了欧洲的重大重新划分，新的 国家涌入地图。然而，它们的边界是由巴黎外交官划定的，并不总是反映不同国籍的人居住的地方。 他们也不能。在奥匈帝国这样一个本来就多元化的帝国里，不同背景的人比邻而居，划定边界绝非易 事。

The Germanspeaking country of Austria became an independent nation, as did Hungary. The area of the Balkans, the site of so much uncertainty and nationalism prior to the war, received a particularly unfavorable decision regarding self-determination. The Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Montenegrins, and other Slavic groups there viewed themselves as separate nationalities, yet all were assembled in a single country, to be called Yugoslavia or “land of the Southern Slavs.” Yugoslavia was simply a diplomatic creation, and it did not survive the century.

德语国家奥地利成 为独立国家，匈牙利也成为独立国家。巴尔干地区是战前充满不确定性和民族主义的地区，在自决方 面做出了特别不利的决定。那里的塞尔维亚人、克罗地亚人、波斯尼亚人、黑山人和其他斯拉夫族群 将自己视为不同的民族，但他们都聚集在一个国家，称为南斯拉夫或“南斯拉夫人的土地”。南斯拉夫只 是一个外交创造物，它没有活过这个世纪

Redrawing Europe. These maps show Europe (a) before and (b) after World War I. Notice the postwar proliferation of new countries created by the Treaty of Versailles.

Other provisions of the treaty were designed to weaken Germany. Great Britain and France wanted Germany to literally pay for it, so they began a painstaking financial accounting. Every destroyed house or building was assigned a monetary value. Every lost military and civilian life was assessed an amount based on what that person’s future earnings might have been. These reparations totaled over $30 billion in 1919 dollars. (For context, a loaf of bread cost about 9 cents at the time.) Wilson hoped to persuade the other Allied leaders to abandon this course but was unable to.

该条约的其他条款旨在削弱德国。英国和法国希望德国真正为此付出代 价，因此他们开始进行艰苦的财务核算。每一座被摧毁的房屋或建筑物都被赋予了货币价值。每一位 丧生的军人和平民的生命都会根据该人未来的收入进行评估。按 1919 年美元计算，这些赔款总额超过 300 亿美元。 （作为上下文，当时一条面包的价格约为 9 美分。）威尔逊希望说服其他盟军领导人放 弃这一路线，但未能成功，

One of the clearest punishments the treaty inflicted on Germany was restrictions on its military capacity. The Allied powers hoped that limiting the might of the German Army would limit its aggressiveness. The method of enforcing these limits was not resolved in Paris, however, and it arose as a real issue in the 1930s.

该条约对德国最明显的惩罚之一是限制其军事能力。盟军希望通过限制德国陆军的力量来限制其侵略性。(中共也应该限制军事能力, 才能保持两岸维持现状和保持和平.) 然而， 执行这些限制的方法并未在巴黎得到解决，并在 20 世纪 30 年代成为一个真正的问题。

Germany was also shrunk, losing 13 percent of the territory it had held in Europe before the war. The Saar region was to be administered by the League of Nations. The Rhineland in the west (the Rhine River Valley) became a demilitarized zone. Germany also lost western territory to both France (Alsace-Lorraine, previously seized by Germany) and Belgium. In the east, German lands and the port of Danzig (now GdaÅ„sk) were given to Poland. Other lands went to Lithuania and the new country of Czechoslovakia. As a result, Germany lost about one-tenth of its population, approximately 6.5 million people. It also had to give up its colonies in Asia and Africa.

德国的国土面积也随之缩小，失去了战前在欧洲所占领土的 13%。萨尔地区将由国际联盟管理。西部 的莱茵兰（莱茵河谷）成为非军事区。德国还失去了西部领土给法国（阿尔萨斯-洛林，之前被德国占 领）和比利时。在东部，德国的土地和但泽港（现格达斯克）被割让给波兰。其他土地归立陶宛和新 国家捷克斯洛伐克所有。结果，德国失去了大约十分之一的人口，大约有 650 万人。它还必须放弃在 亚洲和非洲的殖民地。

One provision of the treaty related directly to Japan and China. Japan had occupied China’s Shandong Province, a former German concession, including the port of Qingdao (Tsingtao), and continued to hold it after the war. Without consulting the millions of Chinese people living there at the time, the treaty makers allowed Japan to retain this territory, which it did until 1922.

该条约的一项条款与日本和中国直接相关。日本占领了中国山东省（前德国租界），包括青岛港，并 在战后继续占据它。条约制定者在没有咨询当时居住在那里的数百万中国人民的情况下，允许日本保 留这片领土，直到 1922 年为止。

The racism of the era was apparent in what was not included in the treaty. Japan had requested a clause affirming the equality of all nations regardless of race. This proviso would have set the stage for more open migration and fairer treatment of immigrants (such as Japanese immigrants to the United States). Several powers supported its inclusion, but Australia (which allowed no non-White immigration) and then the United States stated their opposition. Wilson claimed a unanimous vote was necessary to include it, though this was not true for any other clause. In the end, the racial equality clause was absent from the final version of the treaty.

那个时代的种族主义在条约中未包含的内容中显而易见。日本要求制定一项条款，确认所有国家不分 种族一律平等。这一附带条件将为更开放的移民和更公平地对待移民（例如前往美国的日本移民）奠 定基础。多个国家支持将其纳入其中，但澳大利亚（不允许非白人移民）和美国表示反对。威尔逊声 称需要一致投票才能将其纳入其中，但对于任何其他条款而言并非如此。最终，种族平等条款没有出 现在条约的最终版本中。

There was also disappointment. For instance, in 1915, Italy had been promised territory in Dalmatia in return for joining the Allied cause but was forced to relinquish it due to Wilson’s opposition. This prompted anger in Italy and some anti-American rallies. France was annoyed that it had received only part of Germany’s African colonies of Cameroon and Togo while the rest went to Britain. Japan, besides being angered at the rejection of the racial equality clause, was disappointed that it had not been given all of Germany’s colonial holdings in Asia and the Pacific. It received only some, while others went to New Zealand and Australia. Internal ethnic issues had not been fully solved by the treaty (such as in the creation of Czechoslovakia) and could easily resurface given the chance.

也有失望。 例如，1915年，意大利曾被许诺在达尔马提亚拥有领土，以换取加入盟军的事业，但由于威尔逊的反 对而被迫放弃。这引发了意大利的愤怒和一些反美集会。法国感到恼火的是，它只接收了德国非洲殖 民地喀麦隆和多哥的一部分，而其余的则归英国所有。日本除了对拒绝种族平等条款感到愤怒外，还 对德国没有获得德国在亚洲和太平洋地区的全部殖民地感到失望。它只收到了一些，而其他则流向了 新西兰和澳大利亚。该条约尚未完全解决内部种族问题（例如捷克斯洛伐克的创建），并且一旦有机 会很容易重新浮出水面。

The U.S. Senate’s biggest worry about the Treaty of Versailles was that if the United States joined the League of Nations, its troops could be sent anywhere in the world, drawing the nation into foreign disputes that the Senate, then dominated by the Republican Party, wanted to avoid. Senators feared the treaty would thus cost them their constitutional power to declare war. They also objected to Britain and France’s desire to control the League. For these reasons, the United States did not approve the treaty and did not join the League of Nations. The organization’s ability to mediate and resolve international disputes was weakened by the lack of U.S. participation.

美国参议院对《凡尔赛条约》最大的担忧是，如果美国加入国际联盟，其军队可能被派往世界任何地 方，从而将美国卷入当时由共和党主导的参议院所希望的外国争端中。避免。参议员们担心该条约将 剥夺他们宣战的宪法权力。他们还反对英国和法国控制联盟的愿望。由于这些原因，美国没有批准该 条约，也没有加入国际联盟。由于缺乏美国的参与，该组织调解和解决国际争端的能力受到削弱。

China was frustrated that Japan was allowed to retain Shandong under the treaty, but its protests fell on deaf ears. Anger at China’s treatment helped lead to the May Fourth Movement, which began in Beijing in 1919 as a protest by students. It grew to include labor strikes, calls for a boycott of Japanese-made products, and the removal of Japanese-leaning government officials.

中国对日本根据条约获准保留山东感到沮丧，但日本的抗议却被置若罔闻。 对中国待遇的愤怒引发了五四运动，该运动于 1919 年在北京以学生抗议活动为起点。其发展内容包括 罢工、呼吁抵制日本制造的产品以及罢免亲日政府官员。

World War I devastated the world’s economies. The reparations owed by Germany were the means by which Britain and France planned to deal with their own debt, but they also created an economic house of cards that could easily tumble down.

第一次世界大战摧毁了世界经济。德国所欠的赔款是英国和法国计划用来处理自己债 务的手段，但它们也创造了一个 很容易倒塌的经济纸牌屋。

In the Taisho period in the 1920s, the Japanese economy was buffeted by booms and recessions, the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, inflation, and a serious banking crisis in 1927. Japan had become heavily dependent on trade with the United States, and its urban economy was now undermined by the protectionism practiced by both U.S. and European markets in the form of tariffs on foreign imports. Japan’s economy continued growing in the 1920s, however, as the country increased military production and began making investments in China.
