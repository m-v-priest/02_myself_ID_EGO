== 第一次世界大战

=== 一战爆发的原因: 联盟的捆绑, 让里面的每一个国家, 都被宣战的始作俑者拖下水

It was becoming clear that if war broke out, it would pull into it many countries bound by their treaty obligations to one another.

越来越明显的是，如果战争爆发，许多受条约义务约束的国, 家就会卷入战争。(被拖下水)

Serbia turned to its ally Russia. Appealing to the Slavic heritage of both nations, Serbian leaders extracted a promise that Russia would come to their aid if Austria-Hungary attacked. Austria-Hungary turned to its longtime ally Germany for a show of support.

Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914, after Serbia failed to meet the demands of the Austrian ultimatum. Russia ordered mobilization of its troops on July 30 in response.

Germany now found itself pulled into the fight whether it wanted to be or not, declaring war on Russia on August 1 and ordering full mobilization.

France then ordered its own general mobilization, partly because it was bound to by treaty terms with Russia but also because it feared what a mobilized Germany might do to it, with memories of the Franco-Prussian War in mind. As it turned out, France was right to be apprehensive.

"塞尔维亚"向盟友俄罗斯求助。塞尔维亚领导人利用两国的斯拉夫传统，获得了一个承诺，即如果"奥匈帝国"进攻，俄罗斯将向他们提供援助。"奥匈帝国"择向其长期盟友德国,寻求支持。(德奥意 vs 英法俄)

"奥匈帝国"在"塞尔维亚"未能满足"奥地利"最后通牒的要求后，于 1914 年 7 月 28 日对塞尔维亚宣战。俄罗斯于 7 月 30 日下令动员军队, 予以回应。

德国现在发现自己无论愿意与否 都被卷入了战斗，于 8 月 1 日对俄宣战, 并下令全面动员。

随后，法国下令进行总动员，部分原因是它受到与俄罗斯的条约条款的约束，但也因为它担心动员起来的德国可能会对它做些什么，因为它牢记着"普法战争"的记忆。事实证明，法国的担忧是正确的。

'''

=== 军事上

==== 德国"施利芬计划”

Military planners in several European countries also began designing how operations would occur in the next war.

Germany anticipated that, encircled by enemies, it would have to fight on two fronts—against Russia on one side and France on the other. Developed by Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen in the early 1900s, the Schlieffen Plan held that Russia would be slow to mobilize, so Germany should use that time to attack Belgium and France and then pivot to fight Russia. This plan would make the conflict a short one.

几个欧洲国家的军事规划者, 还开始设计下一场战争的行动方式。

德国预计，在敌人的包围下，它必须在两条战线上作战——一边对抗俄罗斯，另一边对抗法国。"施利芬计划"由陆军元帅阿尔弗雷德·冯·施利芬于 1900 年代初制定，认为俄罗斯的动员速度会很慢，因此德国应该利用这段时间先击败比利时和法国，然后转向与俄罗斯作战。这个计划将使结束战争的用时变短。

'''

==== 法国"第十七号计划”

The French designed Plan XVII, which called for a major French offensive through Alsace-Lorraine to target the industrial heartland of Germany.

法国制定了"第十七号计划"，要求法国通过对"阿尔萨斯-洛林"发动大规模进攻，瞄准德国的工业中心地带。

'''

==== 俄国 “19号计划”

Russia developed Plan 19, which would order Russian attacks on East Prussia once Germany was engaged against France.

俄罗斯制定了 “19号计划”，一旦德国与法国交战，俄罗斯将命令俄罗斯攻击东普鲁士。(其实计划不如变化快，要迭代)

'''

==== 战前时各国的军力状况

The British army, which relied on volunteer troops, was still relatively small at the onset of the war. The Old Regulars, as they were known, numbered only a little over a quarter-million. The strength of Britain lay rather in its navy.

战争开始时，依靠志愿军的英国军队规模相对较小。他们被称为“老正规军”，人数只有25万多一点。英国的实力主要在于它的海军。

The United States, which did not enter the war until 1917, had also chosen to keep a small military force, numbering fewer than 130,000. It had built up its navy beginning in the 1890s. For the United States, keeping a small force was compatible with the isolationist tendencies it had maintained through the 1800s.

直到1917年才参战的美国, 也一直选择保留少量的军事力量，人数不足13万。它从 1890 年代开始建立海军. 对美国来说，保留一支小规模部队, 与其在 1800 年代一直保持的"孤立主义"倾向相一致。

'''

==== 军费的来源

Many national governments coped unsuccessfully with financing the war. Generally, less than a third of the cost was paid through taxation. Instead, borrowing by selling war bonds to the public, printing more money, and taking on more debt became the main method of paying for the war. Price inflation hit new highs as the combination of debt, the printing of money, and product shortages squeezed civilian budgets.

战时军费的主要来源, 只有不到1/3 来自于税收, 其余大量的是来自于:  +
① 承担更多的债务,  +
② 向民众出售”战争债券”,  +
③ 印更多的钱. 由此导致通胀高昂. (钱多物少，肯定通胀)

'''

==== 招募军队的方法

As the British army found itself in need of more troops, it began active recruitment campaigns. One popular tactic tried in the first half of the war was the development of “pals” units. Young men would sign up together and be guaranteed assignment to the same unit, a unit of their pals. While certainly an enticement to serve, this method of organizing units also meant that neighborhoods and villages might see nearly all their young men wounded or killed in the same engagement. The practice was discontinued after the high-casualty Somme campaign in 1916.

战争前半段尝试的一种流行策略, 是发展“伙伴”部队。年轻人会一起报名，并保证被分配到同一个部队，一个由他们的朋友组成的部队。虽然这无疑是一种服役的诱惑，但这种方法也意味着一个社区和村庄几乎所有的年轻人, 都可能在同一次交战中受伤或死亡。 1916 年伤亡惨重的索姆河战役后，这种做法就停止了。

'''

=== 民生上

==== 战时的民众关系

Prejudice and discrimination were widely evident within the major powers in the war. The multitude of nationalities that fought in this war meant that people were regularly engaging with allies from different backgrounds and ethnicities. The prospect of tension in these relationships was clear.

战争中的主要大国中, 普遍存在偏见和歧视。参加这场战争的民族众多，这意味着人们经常与来自不同背景和种族的盟友接触。因此出现紧张关系的预期显而易见。

'''

==== 审查制度的应用

The use of censorship became a common tool to manage civilian discontent by limiting the information distributed about the war effort. Newspapers presented only vague descriptions of battles and losses, and government-sponsored propaganda showed civilians pro-war posters and commentary.

Censorship efforts began in all combatant nations in 1914 and expanded to the United States when it entered in the war in 1917.

审查制度, 通过限制有关战争的信息的传播，成为一种管理平民不满情绪的常用工具。报纸只对战斗和损失进行模糊的描述，政府资助的宣传, 则向平民展示支持战争的海报和评论。

审查制度于1914年, 开始在所有参战国家进行，并在1917年时扩大到美国 (当年美国参战)。

'''

==== 战争中家园被毁的人, 成为了难民

Refugees emerged all over Europe. By the end of 1914, more than three million people in France and Belgium alone had left their homes. While many were eventually able to return, the problem of housing millions of displaced people continued throughout the war.

On the eastern front, Jewish citizens fled their homes by the tens of thousands, and many found themselves further east in Russia than had previously been allowed due to anti-Semitic laws.

欧洲各地出现了难民。到 1914 年底，仅法国和比利时就有超过 300 万人离开家园。虽然许多人最终得以返回，但数百万流离失所者的住房问题, 在整个战争期间持续存在。

在东部战线，数以万计的犹太人逃离家园，许多人发现自己逃到了比过去"反犹太法"允许犹太人存在的地方更远的俄罗斯东部。

'''

==== 战争的持续, 令民众的反战情绪上升

Civilian discontent also rose as more young men were needed for the armies. The war dragged on, and the early enthusiasm evidenced by young recruits in 1914 disappeared.

Some recruits did not have confidence that the national armies would be able to win battles or that it was worth risking their lives in service.

Other young men were conscientious objectors who for religious and philosophical reasons did not believe in fighting wars and therefore did not wish to serve.

Some would-be soldiers in the empires increasingly questioned the value of fighting for imperial glory.

随着军队需要更多的年轻人，平民的不满情绪也在上升。战争一拖再拖，1914年时年轻新兵所表现出的早期热情已经消失。 +
→ 一些新兵不相信国家能够赢得战斗，也不相信冒着生命危险服役是值得的。 +
→ 还有一些年轻人出于良心拒服兵役，出于宗教和哲学上的原因，他们不相信打仗，因此不愿服役。 +
→ 一些本该服兵役的人, 越来越质疑为帝国荣耀而战的价值。

'''

=== 一战过程

The expectation of a short war was not just on Germany’s side. Other countries also believed in 1914 that even if a war broke out that summer, the troops would be home by Christmas.

当时, 不只是德国, 很多国家都认为, 战争会很快结束, 军队能在圣诞来临节前回国。

'''

==== 德国强行通过比利时, 前往法国

Germany’s plan for war on France called for moving westward and then sweeping south to head for Paris. To do this, the German armies would need to march across the country of Belgium. But the King of Belgium declined. In 1839, the German Confederation (the predecessor of Germany) as well as other countries in Europe had been signatories to a treaty that guaranteed the independence of Belgium. The king believed that allowing Germany entrance would undermine its independence, and he could not allow that. The German armies entered anyway but were immensely frustrated by their slow progress and Belgium’s obstinacy.

根据德国的事先计划, 要先打败法国. 因此德军需要穿过比利时. 但比利时国王拒绝了。 因为之前的1839年，德国和欧洲其他国家签署了一项保证比利时独立的条约。比利时国王认为, 允许德国通过, 会损害本国的独立性, 中立性. 但德军强行穿过.

'''

==== 1914 年秋的僵局 (战壕战)

The Battle of the Marne in September 1914 created front lines where a stalemate lasted several years as both sides dug a trench system from which to fight. In the east, Germany found itself facing the Russians in battle much earlier than expected.

与德国之前设想的”必须要先速胜法国, 再打俄国”相反,  德法之间的马恩河战役 (1914年9月), 却被僵持了数年. 不但如此, 在东部，德国发现自己与俄国的交战, 也比预期要早得多。

'''

==== 澳新军团 Gallipoli 之战失败 (1915)

The ANZAC forces representing Australia and New Zealand saw heavy action in the Mediterranean in 1915. The idea behind the British plan was to launch a ship-based artillery attack at the Dardanelles and then land troops on a peninsula called Gallipoli. This would allow the British to link up with Russian forces and coordinate a push against the Turks to isolate the Ottoman Empire and seize control of the important Turkish straits leading to the Sea of Marmara.

The brainchild of Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, the operation suffered problems from its start in February. The first ships took heavy fire and were crippled by mines. The Turks were prepared for a ground invasion and began firing on the Allied troops from secure positions. Those who made it ashore were unable to do more than establish beachheads and did not drive far into the interior. The situation continued through all of 1915 before the British decided to evacuate their troops. Casualties from both sides totaled approximately 900,000, losses commemorated in Australia and New Zealand each year on ANZAC Day, April 25. Churchill resigned over the debacle.

(各国的殖民地, 也被动员起来加入战争.) 1915年，代表澳大利亚和新西兰的"澳新军团", 在地中海采取了大规模行动。英国的计划是, 对"达达尼尔海峡"发动舰载炮击，然后在"加利波利"半岛上登陆。这能使英国与苏联军队联合起来，协调打击土耳其人，孤立"奥斯曼帝国"，并夺取重要的"土耳其海峡"的控制权, 能通往"马尔马拉海"。

该行动是时任"第一海军大臣"温斯顿·丘吉尔的创意，但从二月份开始就遇到了问题。 第一批船只遭到猛烈火力攻击, 并被水雷损坏。土耳其人做好了对付入侵的准备，并开始从安全位置向 盟军开火。那些登上岸的人, 除了建立滩头阵地外什么也做不了，也没有深入内陆地区。这种情况持续了整个 1915 年，直到英国决定撤军。双方伤亡总计约 90 万人，澳大利亚和新西兰每年都会在 4 月 25 日"澳新军团日"纪念这次损失。丘吉尔因这次惨败而辞职。

第一海军大臣 [https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/第一海軍大臣](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%B5%B7%E8%BB%8D%E5%A4%A7%E8%87%A3)

'''

==== 英国封锁德国港口

The naval power of Great Britain was soon brought to bear. The British instituted a blockade of German ports that made it exceedingly difficult for Germany to import the goods it needed. The country’s industrial strength helped it survive this blockade for a good portion of the war, but by its last year, shortages were being felt by every German family. Its navy was not large enough to implement a retaliatory blockade against Britain.

英国海军, 对德国港口进行了封锁，造成德国进口物资变得极其困难. 只能靠德国内循环来解决. 同时, 德国海军不足以对英国实施报复性封锁.

'''

==== 美国参战后, 一战形势开始反转 (1918)

By the summer of 1918, these successes meant that Germany held more territory than at any time in the past. In that same summer, however, the mass of U.S. troops finally arrived.

到 1918 年夏天，这些胜利意味着德国拥有比过去任何时候都多的领土。然而，同年夏天，大批美军终于抵达。

The situation for Germany was bleak. Food shortages were causing widespread panic and despair. Troops began deserting, and civil unrest spread throughout Germany and Austria-Hungary.

German naval commanders wanted to achieve one last moment of glory by sailing the fleet out in late October to engage the British. The German sailors, however, knew there was no chance of victory and had no wish to go on a suicide mission. About one thousand of them mutinied and refused to set sail. In Kiel, home to a major German naval base, both sailors and workers refused to follow orders. The revolt soon spread to other cities.

德国的形势十分严峻。粮食短缺引起了广泛的恐慌和绝望。军队开始开小差，内乱蔓延到整个德国和奥匈帝国。

德国海军指挥官希望在 10 月下旬派遣舰队出海, 与英国交战，从而获得最后的荣耀。然而， 德国水手们知道没有胜利的机会，也不想执行自杀式任务。其中约有一千人叛变并拒绝起航。在德国主要的海军基地所在地"基尔"，水手和工人都拒绝服从命令。叛乱很快蔓延到其他城市。

In Berlin, the far-left Socialist Party’s politicians seized on the burgeoning revolt as a way to force a major change in the government and restore order. They called for the abdication of the Kaiser and the establishment of a republic. Wilhelm II abdicated on November 9, 1918, leaving the country for the Netherlands where he lived until his death in 1941.

在柏林，极左翼"社会党"的政客们抓住了这场迅速兴起的叛乱，以此迫使政府进行重大变革, 并恢复秩序。他们呼吁德皇退位, 并建立共和国。威廉二世于 1918 年 11 月 9 日退位，离开德国前往荷兰，并在那里居住, 直至 1941 年去世。

The civilian political leaders of the more moderate Social Democrats now proclaimed a provisional government, making Germany a republic. The German military agreed to work under this new civilian government.

Political leaders then took up the negotiations that had already begun for an armistice, or cease-fire agreement, with the Allies. They believed Germany could not win the war and was best served by ending it. This maneuver helped isolate the socialist radicals.

较为温和的"社会民主党"的文职政治领导人, 现在宣布成立"临时政府"，使德国成为一个”共和国”。德国军方同意在新的文职政府领导下工作。

随后，政治领导人开始与盟军进行已经开始的"停战或停火协议谈判"。他们认为德国无法赢得战争，结束战争对德国来说是最好的选择。这一策略有助于孤立"社会主义"激进分子。

'''

==== 德国签署”停战”协议, 而非”投降”协议. (1918)

Austria came to terms on an armistice on November 3, 1918, and Hungary followed on November 13. For Germany, an armistice was set to go into effect on November 11 at 11:00 a.m., imposing a cease-fire on all units.

奥地利于 1918 年 11 月 3 日签署停战协议，匈牙利于 11 月 13 日签署停战协议。对于德国来说，停战协议定于 11 月 11 日上午 11:00 生效，所有部队停火。

The decision by the Allies to request an armistice instead of a surrender was important. A surrender meant that one side had to accept defeat. This was not something Germany was prepared to do in 1918. The armistice, however, simply meant that a cease-fire would be imposed while formal negotiations occurred. Germany believed these negotiations would allow it to preserve some of its gains in the war and extract itself from the fighting with a measure of honor and dignity.

德奥一方请求"停战"而不是"投降"的决定, 意义非常重要。"投降"意味着一方必须接受失败。这并不是德国在 1918 年准备做的事情。然而，"停战"协定, 只是意味着在进行正式谈判时,实行停火。德国相信，这种性质的谈判, 将使它能够保留"在战争中取得的一些成果"，并以一定程度的荣誉和尊严退出战斗。

=== “民族自决”思想 → 每个民族都应该建立自己的政府, 建立自己的国家.

'''

=== 日本要求在凡尔赛条约中包含”所有种族一律平等”的内容, 但没有通过.

The racism of the era was apparent in what was not included in the treaty. Japan had requested a clause affirming the equality of all nations regardless of race. This proviso would have set the stage for more open migration and fairer treatment of immigrants (such as Japanese immigrants to the United States).

Several powers supported its inclusion, but Australia (which allowed no non-White immigration) and then the United States stated their opposition. Wilson claimed a unanimous vote was necessary to include it, though this was not true for any other clause. In the end, the racial equality clause was absent from the final version of the treaty.

但那个时代的"种族主义"热点, 却显眼地体现在了"条约中被排除的内容上"(而没有被包括在条约中)。日本要求制定一项条款，确认"所有国家不分种族一律平等"。这一附带条款, 将为更开放的移民, 和更公平地对待移民（例如前往美国的日本移民）奠定基础。

多个国家支持将其纳入其中，但澳大利亚（不允许非白人移民）和美国表示反对。威尔逊声称需要"一致投票"才能将其纳入其中，但对于任何其他条款而言却并非如此。最终，"种族平等"条款没有出现在条约的最终版本中。

'''

|意大利

|For instance, in 1915, Italy had been promised territory in Dalmatia in return for joining the Allied cause but was forced to relinquish it due to Wilson’s opposition. This prompted anger in Italy and some anti-American rallies.

例如，1915年，作为加入协约国事业的回报，意大利曾被承诺在"达尔马提亚"获得领土，但由于威尔逊的反对，意大利被迫放弃了这片领土。这引发了意大利的愤怒和一些反美集会。

|法国

|France was annoyed that it had received only part of Germany’s African colonies of Cameroon and Togo while the rest went to Britain.

法国恼火的是，它只接收了德国在非洲的殖民地"喀麦隆"和"多哥"的一部分，而其余的都归英国所有。

|日本

|Japan, besides being angered at the rejection of the racial equality clause, was disappointed that it had not been given all of Germany’s colonial holdings in Asia and the Pacific. It received only some, while others went to New Zealand and Australia.

除了对"种族平等条款被否决"感到愤怒之外，日本还对没能获得"德国在亚洲和太平洋地区的全部殖民地"而感到失望。它只收到了部分，而其他的则被新西兰和澳大利亚所拥有。

|中国

|China was frustrated that Japan was allowed to retain Shandong under the treaty, but its protests fell on deaf ears. Anger at China’s treatment helped lead to the May Fourth Movement, which began in Beijing in 1919 as a protest by students. It grew to include labor strikes, calls for a boycott of Japanese-made products, and the removal of Japanese-leaning government officials.

条约允许日本占有山东, 在中国引发五四运动 (1919年),  内容发展到包括: 罢免亲日官员, 罢工、抵制日货.

=== 凡尔赛条约被侵蚀, 国际秩序被破坏 → 结果就是二战

The devastation and dislocations of World War I were so profound that much of Europe was hardpressed to recover in its aftermath. Through the tumultuous 1920s, voters worldwide looked to authoritative leaders and parties to solve their country’s problems. This tendency spawned a new approach to governance in the form of fascism and totalitarianism. The resulting regimes propelled the world to a bloodier and more devastating sequel to World War I — World War II.

The attempts by Western nations to build a structure of world peace with the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations ultimately unraveled during the 1930s. National and international grievances, competing ideologies, and economic self-interest all hammered away at the fragile international order.

第一次世界大战造成的破坏和混乱, 是如此严重，以至于欧洲大部分地区, 都难以在战后恢复。在动荡的 20 年代(大萧条时代)，世界各地的选民, 都指望"威权"领导人和政党, 来解决国家的问题。这种趋势催生了"法西斯主义"和"极权主义"形式的新治理方式。由此产生的政权, 将世界推向第一次世界大战的更血腥、更具破坏性的续集——第二次世界大战。

西方国家通过《凡尔赛条约》和"国际联盟" 来建立世界和平架构的尝试, 最终在20世纪30年代破裂。国内和国际的不满、意识形态的竞争, 以及自身经济利益, 都对脆弱的"国际秩序"造成了沉重打击。

The second global conflict in less than half a century began with Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939 and Britain and France’s decision to oppose it. By the summer of 1940, western Europe had fallen to German armies, and in 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union.

不到半个世纪的第二次全球冲, 突始于1939年德国入侵波兰，英国和法国决定反对。到1940年夏天，西欧已落入德国军队之手， 1941年，德国入侵苏联。

'''

== 建立”国际联盟”

=== The Treaty of Versailles 凡尔赛条约 (1919) 塑造的国际秩序 → 建立”国际联盟” (联合国前身), 让各国用协商而非战争的方式, 来解决各自矛盾问题

The war also brought into question the notions of superiority that had permeated Western civilization. People wondered whether the West was declining and could no longer consider itself a moral leader in the world.

一战还对渗透在西方文明中的"优越感", 提出了质疑。 人们想知道西方是否正在衰落，不再认为自己是世界的道德领袖。

Two major and competing forces took shape following World War I. One was disillusionment as the sheer horror of the war was finally understood. The other was the tantalizing idea that society had learned from the war and could build a better tomorrow, freed from the senselessness of war, through new institutions such as the League of Nations. Or, in the case of Russia, a new society would be based on more equitable principles. The reality turned out to be far from the ideal.

第一次世界大战后，形成了两股相互竞争的主要思潮力量。第一股思潮是幻想破灭，因为人们终于明白了战争的纯粹恐怖。另一个是诱人的想法，即社会从战争中吸取了教训，可以通过"国际联盟"等新机构来建设一个更美好的明天，摆脱战争的无意义。或者，对苏联来说，他们以为能建立一个在更公平的原则上的新社会。 但事实证明，现实与理想相差甚远。

In January 1919, the leaders of the major Allied powers (except Russia) met outside Paris at Versailles to negotiate the treaty formally ending the war. Committees were assigned to resolve the many issues concerning not only Europe but also the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The conference lasted about a year. In its finished form, the Treaty of Versailles was actually a series of treaties.

1919年1月，主要协约国(即英美一方)（俄罗斯除外）领导人在巴黎郊外的凡尔赛宫会面，谈判正式结束战争的条约 。委员会被指派解决"不仅涉及欧洲, 而且还涉及中东、非洲和亚洲的许多问题"。会议持续了大约一年。《凡尔赛条约》的最终版本, 实际上是一系列条约的集合.

In January 1918, he had already published a plan he hoped would be the basis of the treaty—the Fourteen Points—embodying his wish to prevent future war by solving issues he believed had led to the recent conflict. Among these points were the rights of neutral nations, freedom of the seas, and the need to break up the empires that had caused the war and create new sovereign states in Europe. Wilson’s last point proposed a League of Nations where member nations could come together for mutual security and work out problems without resorting to war.

1918年1月，美国伍德罗·威尔逊 ( Woodrow Wilson) 总统已经发表了一项计划，他希望该计划将成为条约的基础——十四点原则——体现了他希望通过解决他认为导致一战的问题, 来防止未来战争的愿望。其中包括: +
① 中立国的权利、 +
② 海上航行自由，以及  +
③ 需要打破引发战争的帝国， +
④ 在欧洲建立新的主权国家。 +
威尔逊的最后一点建议建立一个 ⑤"国际联盟"，成员国可以为了共同的安全, 而在一起以"不诉诸战争"的手段解决问题。

'''

=== 美国议会没有批准加入国联

The U.S. Senate’s biggest worry about the Treaty of Versailles was that if the United States joined the League of Nations, its troops could be sent anywhere in the world, drawing the nation into foreign disputes that the Senate, then dominated by the Republican Party, wanted to avoid. Senators feared the treaty would thus cost them their constitutional power to declare war. They also objected to Britain and France’s desire to control the League. For these reasons, the United States did not approve the treaty and did not join the League of Nations. The organization’s ability to mediate and resolve international disputes was weakened by the lack of U.S. participation.

美国参议院没有批准<凡尔赛条约>, 也不加入国际联盟的理由是: ①一旦加入, 美国就可能被迫卷入外国的争端中. ②参议员们担心, 该条约可能会剥夺他们宣战的宪法权力。

由于美国没参加国联, 导致该组织调解和解决国际争端的能力, 受到削弱。

'''

=== “国际联盟”的权力软弱, 没有强制力, 因此解决不了国家间的矛盾争议

The same could be said of the League of Nations. Based on high ideals, the League could issue statements, restrictions, or condemnations, but it could not compel other countries to limit their activities. Assessing trade restrictions on a country might have some (minor) impact, but the League had no military arm that could physically intervene in a member country’s actions. Thus, as the 1930s began, it was regularly challenged by aggressive acts across the globe that it was powerless to influence.

Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931. Italy invaded Libya in 1931 and Ethiopia in 1935. The League did protest, especially over the Ethiopian invasion, but it could do little more than impose economic sanctions against Italy, and even these were not upheld by all countries. It was clear the League had no real power and no country need fear it.

"国际联盟"也是如此。基于崇高理想，联盟可以发表声明、限制或谴责，但不能强迫其他国家限制其活动。做出评估要对一个国家进行制裁, 贸易限制, 可能会产生一些（较小的）影响，但国联没有军事力量可以实际干预成员国的行动。因此，随着 20 世纪 30 年代的开始，它经常受到全球范围内侵略行为的挑战，而它却无能为力。

日本于 1931 年入侵满洲里。意大利于 1931 年入侵利比亚，于 1935 年入侵埃塞俄比亚。 国际联盟确实提出了抗议，特别是针对埃塞俄比亚的入侵，但它除了对意大利实施经济制裁之外, 其他能做的也不多，而且即使是这些制裁也没有得到所有国家的支持。很明显，国联没有实权，没有国家需要害怕它。

'''

=== 日本退出国联 (1933.3)

The local Japanese commander took the opportunity to occupy Mukden, and field commanders in Korea dispatched reinforcements without any orders from Tokyo to do so. Japanese public opinion supported the army’s action.

(1931年918事件, ) 日本当地指挥官趁机占领了奉天，朝鲜战地指挥官在没有得到东京命令 的情况下就派出了增援部队。日本舆论支持军队的行动。

As the Chinese government called for the League of Nations to intervene and pledged to accept its rulings, a British diplomat in Japan warned of “an atmosphere of gun-grease” in Japan.

In the fall of 1931, the League established the Lytton Commission to look into the situation. In January 1932, U.S. secretary of state Henry Stimson announced the Stimson Doctrine, which refused to recognize Manchukuo as an independent state.

当中国政府呼吁"国际联盟"进行干预, 并承诺会接受其裁决时，一名英国驻日外交官警告称，日本存在“火药味”。

1931 年秋，国际联盟成立了利顿委员会, 来调查这一情况。 1932年1月，美国国务卿史汀生宣布“史汀生主义” ，拒绝承认满洲国为独立国家。

Chinese public opinion was aroused, and in January 1932, clashes erupted between Japanese marines and Chinese troops in the outskirts of Shanghai.

Japan formally recognized the establishment of Manchukuo, its client state (a subordinate and dependent area), as a theoretically free, completely sovereign, and independent nation. The Lytton Report, published in October 1932, found fault on both sides but did not recommend full autonomy for Manchukuo. Japan responded by withdrawing from the League in March 1933.

中国舆论被激起，1932年1月，日本海军陆战队与中国军队, 在上海郊区爆发冲突(淞沪会战)。

日本正式承认其附庸国（从属和依赖地区）"伪满洲国"的建立，作为一个在理论上自由，完全主权和独立的国家。1932年10月发表的《利顿报告》（Lytton Report）指出双方都有过错，但没有建议满洲国完全自治。作为回应，日本于1933年3月退出国联。

=== 意大利吞并埃塞俄比亚, 作为殖民地 (1934-1936) → 体现出了”国联”的软弱

In furtherance of his promise to revive Italian glory, Benito Mussolini (popularly known as Il Duce, “the leader”) sought to expand the Italian protectorate of Somali in East Africa.

A border dispute with Ethiopia, which Italy had long sought to colonize, arose in November 1934, and the Ethiopians took the matter to the League of Nations on January 5, 1935. When a full-scale Italian invasion of Ethiopia began on October 3 of that year, the League Council immediately declared Italy the aggressor, and fifty-one member nations approved sanctions against Italy. Unwilling to defy Mussolini, however, the British and French undermined the League in a secret agreement permitting Italy to absorb Ethiopia into a special economic zone.

In May 1936, Italian forces took the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, and shortly thereafter, Italy formally annexed the country. In Italy, Mussolini’s popularity grew, especially among Italian youth.

为了兑现"重振意大利辉煌"的承诺，贝尼托·墨索里尼（俗称“领袖”）寻求扩大"意大利"在东非的"索马里"保护国。

1934 年 11 月，意大利与"埃塞俄比亚"发生边界争端 (意大利长期以来一直寻求在埃塞俄比亚建立殖民地。)，埃塞俄比亚人于 1935 年 1 月 5 日将此事提交"国际联盟"。意大利于 10 月 3 日开始全面入侵埃塞俄比亚。那一年，"国联理事会"立即宣布意大利为侵略者，五十一个成员国批准对意大利实施制裁。然而，英国和法国不愿反抗墨索里尼，而是通过一项允许意大利将埃塞俄比亚纳入"经济特区"的秘密协议, 破坏了国联。

1936年5月，意大利军队占领"埃塞俄比亚"首都"亚的斯亚贝巴"，不久后，意大利正式吞并该国。在意大利，墨索里尼的受欢迎程度不断上升，尤其是在意大利年轻人中。

=== 德国退出国联 (1933.10)

Britain and France were even more reluctant to confront Germany. Adolf Hitler had often pledged to scrap the Treaty of Versailles. His first step came just nine months after becoming chancellor when he conducted referenda to let the German people decide whether they wanted to remain in the League of Nations. The result was predictable, and in October 1933, Germany withdrew from the League.

英国和法国更不愿意与德国对抗。阿道夫·希特勒经常承诺废除《凡尔赛条约》。他的第一步是在就任总理九个月后举行的，他进行了全民公投，让德国人民决定是否留在国际联盟。结果是可以预见的，1933年10月，德国退出了国联。

== 一战后, 人们对维护和平所做的努力 → 裁军, 非战公约

=== (裁军) 华盛顿海军会议 → 五国关于限制海军军备条约 (1922)

Still reeling from World War I in the 1920s, the governments of the major powers generally supported disarmament and limited military buildup. Many agreements reached in the 1920s reflected this commitment to goodwill among nations.

20 年代，主要大国政府仍饱受第一次世界大战的影响，普遍支持裁军, 和只保持有限的军事建设。1920 年代达成的许多协议, 都反映了国家间对善意的承诺。

In 1921, the Washington Naval Conference opened to address the issue of the naval arms race that had taken place before and during World War I. U.S. secretary of state Charles Evans Hughes proposed that the three major naval powers—Britain, the United States, and Japan—each scuttle a number of ships and restrict future construction.

1921年，"华盛顿海军会议"开幕，旨在解决第一次世界大战之前和期间发生的海军军备竞赛问题。美国国务卿查尔斯·埃文斯·休斯提出，三大海军强国——英国、美国和日本——每一次都击沉了一些船只, 并限制未来的建造。

The Five-Power Treaty that emerged limited the construction of warships and the size of aircraft carriers. It established ratios for warships whereby Britain and the United States could have the same number, and for every five ships they had, Japan could have three and France and Italy 1.75 each. Britain and the United States were allowed more ships because they maintained fleets in both the Atlantic and the Pacific to protect their colonies.

随之而来的"五国条约", 限制了战舰的建造和航空母舰的规模。它规定了英国和美国可以拥有相同数量的军舰的比例，每拥有5艘军舰，日本可以拥有3艘，法国和意大利各拥有1.75艘。英国和美国被允许拥有更多船只，因为它们在大西洋和太平洋, 都拥有舰队来保护它们的殖民地。

Japan often argued that it was not treated fairly by Western powers at either the Treaty of Versailles negotiations or the Washington Naval Conference in the 1920s.

但日本经常辩称，无论是在《凡尔赛条约》谈判, 还是在 1920 年代的华盛顿海军会议上，它都没有受到西方列强的公平对待。

=== 非战公约 (1928) → 放弃战争作为国家的外交政策

By the late 1920s, optimism was high that the pain of war might be a thing of the past. It was in this spirit that the Kellogg-Briand Pact was written. The pact was a negotiation between U.S. secretary of state Frank Kellogg and Aristide Briand, the French foreign minister, renouncing war as an instrument of national policy. Fifteen nations signed it in 1928, and another forty-seven followed over the next years.

However, there was no way to enforce it, and no repercussions for signatories that failed to live up to its ideals. Thus, it did little to curb the aggressive military policies of many nations during the following decade.

到 20 年代末，人们普遍乐观地认为, 战争的痛苦可能会成为过去(日本和苏联肯定不会这么想, 苏联还想赤化世界呢)。正是本着这种精神，制定了《凯洛格-布里安条约》 (非战公约)。该协议是美国国务卿弗兰克·凯洛格, 和法国外交部长阿里斯蒂德·白里安, 之间的谈判，放弃将战争作为国家政策的工具。 1928 年，有 15 个国家签署了该协议，接下来的几年里又有 47 个国家签署了该协议。

然而，没有办法执行它，对没签署它的国家也没有产生任何影响。因此，在随后的十年中，它几乎没有制止许多国家的侵略政策。
