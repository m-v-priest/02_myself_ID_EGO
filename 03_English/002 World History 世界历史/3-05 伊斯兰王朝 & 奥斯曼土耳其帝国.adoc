== 伊斯兰王朝

=== 早期

Because many people were illiterate at this time and not writing their history as it happened, we have less evidence outside religious scripture to help us reconstruct it. the Arabs transmitted this information primarily through a process of memorization and oral recitation.

我们缺乏证据来重建阿拉伯人的早期历史. 原因是: +

- 当时他们许多人都是文盲
- 阿拉伯人主要通过记忆和口述, 来一代代传递他们的历史.
- 即使写历史, 也没按当时的实际发生的情况来记录.
- 因此, 我们能依靠的, 大体也就只有不靠谱的宗教经文了.

Little unified the peoples of the Arabian Peninsula prior to the seventh century.

Seen from the outside, the Arabian Peninsula of the fifth and sixth centuries CE was a seemingly marginal space, on the southern fringes of the last great realms of antiquity, the Byzantine (Roman) and Sasanian (Persian) Empires.

In the very north of Arabia, along the southern borders of the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires, the people of northern Arabia regularly harassed trade caravans traveling to and from imperial urban centers. To combat this aggression along their southern borders, both the Byzantines and the Persians employed certain Arab confederations to create a buffer between the settled peoples and the raiders from the south.

七世纪之前, 阿拉伯半岛几乎没有统一过。

从外部看，公元五世纪和六世纪的阿拉伯半岛, 似乎是一个边缘地带，位于"拜占庭"（罗马）和"萨珊王朝"（波斯）帝国的南部边缘。

在这两个帝国的南部边界, 阿拉伯人经常骚扰来往于帝国的商队。为此, 拜占庭人和波斯人都雇佣了一些阿拉伯联盟，在自己和阿拉伯入侵者之间, 建立缓冲区。

===  (先知)穆罕穆德死后, 其集团面临的问题

When Muhammad died in 632 CE, members of the early Muslim ummah needed to immediately answer several important questions. Who was capable of now leading the community, of following in the footsteps of a leader who claimed prophecy—the ability to communicate with God—when none of those who remained could do so? Another critical question was about the survival of the community: what, exactly, had Muhammad accomplished by uniting the Arab tribes, and where would they go from here?

当穆罕默德于公元 632 年去世时，早期穆斯林乌玛的成员, 需要立即回答几个重要问题:  +

→ 现在谁有能力领导社区，追随一位声称有预言（与上帝沟通的能力）的领导人的脚步，而剩下的人都无法做到这一点？ +
→ 一个关键问题是关于社区的生存：穆罕默德通过团结阿拉伯部落, 到底完成了什么？未来他们将何去何从？

'''

====  继承人问题

In many tribal- and clan-based societies like that of the Arabs, leadership was not hereditary, meaning it did not immediately pass to the heir upon the death of the leader. Thus, as Muhammad was dying, two primary claimants for leadership emerged: his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib, and a friend and confidant of Muhammad’s named Abu Bakr.

In the end, Abu Bakr was chosen to be the first successor to Muhammad.

在许多以部落和氏族为基础的社会中， 比如阿拉伯人，领导权不是世袭的。因此，当穆罕默德弥留之际，出现了两位主要的领导权争夺者：他的女婿"阿里·本·阿比·塔利卜"，以及穆罕默德的朋友和知己 "阿布·伯克尔"。 最终，"阿布伯克尔"被选为穆罕默德的第一任继承人. (得亏与穆罕默德有血缘关系的子孙, 没有称为继承人, 否则, 就和太平天国一样了, 与上帝有关系的人, 来父传子, 就变成帝制了. 而基督教中, 任何一位先知都没有把宗教帝国继承传给儿子接班.)

There seems to have been near immediate recognition that things without Muhammad would be different, not least of which because the caliph was not assuming the mantle of another prophet capable of communicating directly with God as Muhammad had.

但人们似乎立即认识到，没有穆罕默德，事情将会有所不同，尤其是因为哈里发无法继承先知穆罕默德的"超能力"-- 与真主直接沟通.

'''

====  联盟存续问题

Arab tribes had come together for a common cause in the pre-Islamic period, such as a war against another tribe or recognition of the strength of a chieftain. But once that cause had been accomplished or that chieftain had died, the confederacy typically disbanded.

Tensions arose after Muhammad’s death not just over leadership and inheritance, but also over whether the alliance was ever intended to last beyond its founder.

Some Arab tribes left to return to their homes, while others may have believed they could discard their commitment to the worship of the one God and membership in this confederation.

From the perspective of the Muslims, however, this was apostasy, and a conflict known as the Ridda Wars then began in an attempt to force these Arab tribes to continue to honor their agreements with the Muslims. The Ridda Wars also appear to have been expansionist, bringing into the fold, whether by treaty or force, Arab tribes that had never been aligned with Muhammad’s community during his lifetime.

This effort was the first step of a wider movement called the Arab-Islamic or Arab-Muslim conquests, and by 633 the entirety of Arabia had been brought under the control of this first Islamic state.

早先, 阿拉伯部落, 会为了共同的目的而暂时联合在一起, 或者是因为承认某一领导人的能力, 或者是为了与另一个战争战争. 一旦这个目的完成, 或领袖去世, 联盟就会解散. (树倒猢狲散)

穆罕穆德死后, 联盟也一样面对”是否存续下去, 还是解散”的问题. 一些阿拉伯部落选择离开. 一些部落决定放弃对伊斯兰教的信仰. 然而, 在穆斯林看来, 这是”叛教“. 因此, 开启了”里达战争”, 目的是迫使这些阿拉伯部落, 继续遵守与穆斯林的协议。

同时, 里达战争也是扩张性的, 将穆罕默德生前从未结盟过的阿拉伯部落, 也迫使他们入教. 到 633 年，整个阿拉伯半岛,  已被置于第一个伊斯兰国家的控制之下。

The term “Arab-Muslim conquest” has another drawback in that some participants were non-Arabs. Other fighters were Arabs but had not necessarily formally converted to Islam. In the end, the most important differentiator of status in this earliest society was not Arab versus non-Arab or Muslim versus non-Muslim, but rather conqueror versus conquered.

不过, “阿拉伯-穆斯林的征服”这个词汇, 有个缺点, 即其军队中并不全是阿拉伯人. 即使是阿拉伯人, 他也未必皈依伊斯兰教. 事实上, 在这个最早的社会中，其地位最重要的区别, 不是"阿拉伯人"或"非阿拉伯人"，也不是"穆斯林"与"非穆斯林"，而是"征服者"与"被征服者"的身份。

Little written material of the seventh-century Arab-Muslim conquerors survives.

关于七世纪阿拉伯穆斯林征服者的书面材料, 几乎没有留存下来。

===  (第1任) 倭马亚王朝 (661-750)

With Ali’s death, the Umayyads, led by Mu‘awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, established Islam’s first hereditary dynasty. Moving the capital of their state from the Prophet’s city of Medina to the Syrian city of Damascus.

阿里死后，由”穆阿维叶一世”领导的倭马亚部落, 建立了伊斯兰教的第一个世袭王朝--倭马亚王朝。他们将国家首都从先知的城市麦地那, 迁至叙利亚城市大马士革.

chatgpt: "Umayyads"（阿拉伯语：بنو أمية，Banu Umayya）最初是指一个阿拉伯部族——倭马亚部族（Banu Umayya），是阿拉伯古莱什部落的一个重要分支，先祖是乌玛雅（Umayya ibn Abd Shams）。然而在伊斯兰教历史中，"Umayyads" 通常指的是由该部族建立的倭马亚王朝（Umayyad Dynasty），而不是特指民族。

It was not always clear that the Arab-Muslims would be successful against the Byzantines and the Persians, the last empires of antiquity. Nonetheless, starting in 634 and continuing into the early eighth century, they found enormous success conquering much of the territory around the Mediterranean basin and central Asia. The new Islamic state, or caliphate (an area under the control of a caliph), was larger than the realm of Alexander the Great, the Romans, or the Han Chinese; it was the largest empire the world had yet seen.

人们并不总是清楚, 阿拉伯穆斯林能否成功对抗古代最后的帝国拜占庭和波斯。尽管如此，从 634 年开始, 一直持续到 8 世纪初，他们取得了巨大的成功，征服了地中海盆地, 和中亚周围的大部分领土. 新的伊斯兰国家，或称"哈里发国"（哈里发控制下的地区），比亚历山大大帝、罗马人或汉人的领土还要大。它是世界上迄今为止最大的帝国。

====  进攻"(东罗马)拜占庭帝国”

By the 650s, the Byzantine Empire survived the Arab-Muslim conquests, but it never again controlled much of the territory of the old Roman east.

到了 650 年代，拜占庭帝国在阿拉伯穆斯林的征服中幸存下来，但它再也没有控制过古罗马东部的大部分领土。

'''

====  征服"萨珊波斯”

The conquest of Persia proved to be a longer-term process. Sasanian-controlled territory was vast and geographically diverse, and the independence the Sasanian nobility had wrested from the central government following the war with the Byzantines meant the Arab-Muslims needed to negotiate with many local governors and landed elites for the surrender of their territory.

事实证明, 征服波斯是一个长期的过程。萨珊王朝控制的领土幅员辽阔，地理分布多样，萨珊贵族在与拜占庭人的战争后, 从中央政府手中夺取了独立 (即萨珊王朝没有统一的中央政府)，这意味着阿拉伯穆斯林需要与许多"地方总督"和"土地精英"进行谈判, 才能令他们交出领土。

'''

====  进占西班牙南部

In 711, however, the armies of the Umayyad Caliphate crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and overran the kingdom. The Umayyad armies that invaded Spain never succeeded in controlling the entire peninsula. Christian kingdoms persisted in the north, though they were weak and often fought with each other.

Another reason was that non-Arabic soldiers, like the North African Amazigh (Berbers), always felt shortchanged when Arab leaders divided the spoils of conquest. This ethnic and regional conflict played an important role in the collapse of the Umayyad dynasty.

711年，倭马亚哈里发的军队, 越过直布罗陀海峡, 并占领了该王国。入侵西班牙的倭马亚军队从未成功控制整个半岛，基督教王国在北方仍然存在，尽管它们很弱, 并且经常互相争斗。  +
另一个原因是，当阿拉伯领导人瓜分征服的战利品时，非阿拉伯士兵，如北非阿马齐格人（柏柏尔人），总是感到自己受到了欺骗。这场种族和地区冲突, 在倭马亚王朝的崩溃中发挥了重要作用.

The last decades of Umayyad rule were defined by factionalism and infighting. There, in the province of Khurasan, Arab- Muslims had settled after the conquests, often intermarrying with the Indigenous Persians. By the mid-eighth century, several generations of these mixed-ethnicity Muslims had come to feel disenfranchised in the region, and Khurasan became a hotbed of revolutionary activity. Many who were frustrated with Umayyad rule and ready for a change met to imagine a more open Islamic community.

倭马亚王朝最后几十年, 充满了派系斗争和内讧。在征服后，阿拉伯穆斯林在"呼罗珊省"定居下来，经常与土著波斯人通婚。到了八世纪中叶，几代混血穆斯林开始感到在该地区被剥夺了公民权，呼罗珊成为革命活动的温床。许多对倭马亚统治感到不满, 并准备进行变革的人会面，想象一个更加开放的伊斯兰社会.

===  (第2任) 阿拔斯王朝 （749-1258 年）

This revolutionary group championed the right of the family of Muhammad to hold the position of caliph. Its members supported the claims of the descendants of Ibn Abbas, a first cousin of Muhammad, and thus came to be known as the Abbasids. In 749, after several years of growing dissatisfaction, they rose in rebellion against the Umayyads, overthrowing Islam’s first dynasty within a year and establishing themselves as the new rulers of the Middle East.

Abbasids claimed the title of caliph from the year 750 through to the early sixteenth century, although the power they sought waxed and waned over time.

这个革命团体, 捍卫"穆罕默德家族"担任"哈里发职位"的权利。其成员支持穆罕默德的堂弟伊本·阿拔斯后裔的主张，因此被称为阿拔斯王朝。 749年，经过几年的不满，他们起兵反抗倭马亚王朝，一年之内就推翻了伊斯兰教第一个王朝，成为中东的新统治者。

阿拔斯王朝从 750 年, 到 16 世纪初, 一直声称拥有"哈里发"的头衔，尽管他们所追求的权力, 随着时间的推移而起落。

In 750, the Umayyads in turn were overthrown by the Abbasids (749–1258), a new Islamic dynasty that sought to expand eastward from the Middle East even as the Tang dynasty drove westward from China. The Abbasids moved their capital to Baghdad. This change streamlined their dominance of the Silk Roads, letting them use the Persian Gulf to effectively bypass the Red Sea, which was the seaborne trade route closest to the former Umayyad capital in Syria.

750年，"倭马亚王朝"被"阿拔斯王朝"（749–1258年）推翻，阿拔斯王朝是一个新兴的伊斯兰王朝，试图从中东向东扩张，同时中国的唐朝则在向西推进。阿拔斯王朝将首都迁至巴格达，这一变动强化了他们对丝绸之路的控制，使他们能够利用波斯湾, 有效绕过红海——红海曾是最接近倭马亚王朝前首都(在叙利亚)的海上贸易路线。

Despite their ambitions, the Abbasids’ eastward expansion was halted in 751 when a combined Arab-Tibetan army met Tang forces in the Battle of Talas River near the town of Atlakh. Initially a stalemate, the battle turned in favor of the Abbasids when Turkic forces that were allied with the Tang switched allegiances and joined the Abbasids. Although the Abbasids were victorious, the engagement marked the end of expansion for both empires.

尽管野心勃勃，阿拔斯王朝的东扩, 却在 751 年停止了，当时一支阿拉伯-西藏联军, 在阿特拉赫镇附近的"怛拉斯河之战"中, 与唐朝军队相遇。战事最初陷入僵局，但随着与唐朝结盟的突厥军队转而加入阿拔斯王朝，战事对阿拔斯王朝有利。尽管阿拔斯王朝取得了胜利，但这次交战标志着两个帝国扩张的结束。

== (伊斯兰教, 突厥) 奥斯曼土耳其帝国 (1299-1923年)

With an empire that bordered both the western and eastern worlds, the Ottoman Turks began to play an important role in Asian and European affairs in the thirteenth century.

奥斯曼土耳其帝国, 是一个与东西方世界接壤的帝国，从十三世纪起开始, 在亚洲和欧洲事务中发挥重要作用。

By the eleventh century, however, the Byzantines found their power challenged by the arrival of Turkic tribes such as the Seljuks, who settled in the eastern half of their domains and gradually wrested control of the area from them.

As different Turkic tribes arrived and settled in the region, one group, the Ottomans, soon rose to prominence over others. The Ottomans were Turkic-speaking pastoralists. The Ottomans eventually deprive the Byzantines of their last remnants of power.

然而，到了十一世纪，拜占庭人发现, 他们的权力受到塞尔柱人(后建立奥斯曼帝国)等突厥部落的到来的挑战. 塞尔柱人定居在拜占庭领土的东半部，并逐渐从拜占庭手中夺取了对该地区的控制权。

随着不同的突厥部落抵达, 并定居在该地区，奥斯曼这一部落, 很快就在其他部落中脱颖而出。奥斯曼人是讲突厥语的牧民. 奥斯曼人最终剥夺了拜占庭人最后的残余权力。

The areas west of the Volga River, populated largely by Orthodox Christians, were the only ones that did not see the majority convert to Islam, and they remain so to this day.

伏尔加河以西的地区, 主要是"东正教"基督徒，是唯一没有看到大多数人皈依伊斯兰教的地区，直到今天仍然如此。

===  灭亡东罗马帝国 (1453)

The Byzantine emperor Manuel II had assisted Mehmed’s rivals for the Ottoman throne, attempting to keep the Ottomans weak by prolonging the civil war.

The Byzantines were also close allies of the Venetians and Genoese, who controlled trade in the Aegean and the Black Seas and whose ships could interfere with Ottoman efforts to control both sides of the Dardanelles.

拜占庭皇帝曼努埃尔二世, 曾协助穆罕默德的竞争对手争夺奥斯曼帝国的王位，试图通过延长他们的内战, 来削弱奥斯曼帝国。

拜占庭人也是"威尼斯人"和"热那亚人"的亲密盟友，后者控制着爱琴海和黑海的贸易，他们的船只可以干扰"奥斯曼帝国控制'达达尼尔海峡'两岸的努力"。

He ordered that the Byzantine cathedral of Hagia Sophia be left intact and converted into a mosque. He also ordered a new mosque, the Fatih Mosque (“Conqueror’s Mosque”), to be built in the city.

(穆罕默德占领君士坦丁堡后,) 他下令将拜占庭式的"圣索菲亚大教堂", 完好无损地保留下来，改建为清真寺。他还下令在城内建造一座新清真寺，即"法提赫清真寺"（“征服者清真寺”）

Mehmed regarded himself not as a usurper but as the rightful successor to the Byzantines. He declared himself Caesar, the heir to the old Roman imperial throne. He appointed a new leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Gennadius II, who in turn recognized Mehmed’s claim as the legitimate heir of the last Byzantine emperor.

The last emperor’s actual heirs, his nephews, were taken into Mehmed’s service and occupied important administrative positions in the empire.

穆罕默德二世并不认为自己是篡位者，而是拜占庭人的合法继承人。他宣称自己是凯撒，是旧"罗马帝国"王位的继承人。他任命了东正教的新领袖"根纳迪乌斯二世"，后者又承认穆罕默德是"拜占庭末代皇帝"的合法继承人。

最后一位皇帝的实际继承人，即其侄子，被纳入穆罕默德的手下，并在帝国中担任重要的行政职务。(这就是用前朝统治者的子孙, 来安抚前朝人心)

He issued kanun, laws made by the sultan, as opposed to sharia (religious law) interpreted by Islamic judges, and compiled them in the Kanun-name (“Book of the Law”). Kanun dealt with issues that sharia often did not address, such as taxation or punishment for certain crimes.

他颁布了由"苏丹"制定的"卡努(kanun)法律"，与由伊斯兰"法官"解释的"伊斯兰教法"(sharia)相反，并以卡努(kanun)的名义编纂了这些法律。卡努处理了伊斯兰教法通常没有涉及的问题，比如税收或对某些罪行的惩罚。

'''

===  控制红海和黑海的贸易, 迫使欧洲人, 寻找去往亚洲的新海路

the Ottomans gained control of part of the Silk Roads. The Ottomans commanded Red Sea ports in Egypt after defeating the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517, which gave them additional control over the spice trade. The Ottomans also dominated trade on the Black Sea.

The exclusion of Italian merchants from their traditional trade routes, the heavy taxes imposed on goods that traveled overland, many Europeans’ dislike for transacting business with Muslims, and the expense of overland trade led western Europeans to seek all-water oceanic routes to South and East Asia.

奥斯曼人控制了部分丝绸之路，并在 1517 年击败"马穆鲁克苏丹国"后, 还控制了埃及的红海港口, 这使他们对香料贸易有了更多的控制权。奥斯曼人还主导了黑海的贸易。

由于意大利商人被排除在传统贸易路线之外, 并且奥斯曼人还对陆路货物征收重税，因此许多欧洲人不喜欢与穆斯林做生意. 并且再加上陆路贸易的高成本，导致西欧人寻求前往南亚和东亚的全水路航线。
