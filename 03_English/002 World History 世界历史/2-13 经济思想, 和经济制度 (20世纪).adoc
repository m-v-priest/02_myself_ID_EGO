==  20世纪30年代的大萧条

By the 1930s, economic instability had become common as the Great Depression plunged nations into poverty and unemployment. Governments dealt with the downturn in a variety of ways, but solutions in several countries included more authoritarian policies.

到了 20 世纪 30 年代，大萧条使各国陷入贫困和失业，经济不稳定变得普遍。各国政府以多种方式应对经济衰退，但一些国家的解决方案,包括进了更加专制的政策。

===  经济危机的原因

No economic depression is caused by one element alone.

任何经济萧条都不是由某一因素单独造成的。

|-> 社会财富分配不均, 造成需求端弱

|Contributing to this financial catastrophe was the unequal distribution of wealth. With consumers both at home and abroad unable to purchase, the twin problems of overproduction and underconsumption ground the economy to a halt.

造成这场金融灾难的是财富分配不均。由于国内外消费者无力购买，生产过剩,和消费不足的双重问题, 使经济陷入停滞。

|-> 互相高关税, 导致贸易战, 又抑制了世界各国的经济发展

|The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was an example of the isolationist and protectionist policies the U.S. government followed in the 1920s. An increased tariff of nearly 40 percent had already been enacted in 1922. Smoot-Hawley raised tariff rates another 20 percent on more than twenty thousand kinds of imported goods, supposedly to protect American farmers and industries from foreign competition. These extreme rates caused other countries to institute their own retaliatory high tariff rates on U.S. goods. Its businesses were unable to recoup any of their monies by selling goods overseas. Smoot-Hawley was the highest tariff the U.S. government has ever enacted. It helped stifle world trade, which decreased 30 percent by the early 1930s.

1930 年的《斯穆特-霍利关税法案》, 是美国政府在 20 年代奉行的"孤立主义"和"保护主义"政策的一个例子。 1922 年已经实施了近 40% 的关税上调。"斯穆特-霍利法案"将 2000 多种进口商品的关税税率, 又提高了 20%，据称是为了"保护美国农民和工业免受外国竞争"。这些极端税率, 导致其他国家也对美国商品征收"报复性高关税"。美国企业也无法通过向海外出售商品, 来收回任何资金。"斯穆特-霍利关税"是美国政府有史以来颁布的最高关税。它抑制了世界贸易，到 20 世纪 30 年代初，世界贸易下降了 30%。

|-> 美国银行收回对外国的贷款, 造成外国公司资金流断裂, 倒闭, 又抑制了经济发展

|One of the key aspects of the Great Depression was the way it encumbered foreign trade around the globe. Worldwide gross domestic product (GDP)—the value of all the goods and services a country produces in one year—decreased by 15 percent between 1929 and 1932. With trade plummeting, many U.S. banks began recalling loans made to foreign businesses and countries, which caused crises in other places.

大萧条的关键方面之一是, 它阻碍了全球对外贸易。 1929 年至 1932 年间，全球国内生产总值 (GDP) ——一个国家一年内生产的所有商品和服务的价值——下降了 15%。随着贸易大幅下滑，许多美国银行开始召回向外国企业和国家提供的贷款，这使得导致其他地方也出现危机(投资人收回银根, 创业公司资金流断裂)。

|-> 美国人没有储蓄, 造成失业即破产

|When the Depression began, the majority of American families (80 percent) had no savings at all, so a job loss quickly led to homelessness and hunger.

大萧条开始时，大多数美国家庭（80%）根本没有积蓄，因此失业很快导致无家可归和饥饿. (裸泳者，没有储蓄后援，这种人只能活在非失业期，一遇失业即完蛋)

|-> 银行挤兑破产, 导致储户损失所有储蓄, 直接也破产

|The lack of banking regulations meant that if a bank went bankrupt, those who had placed their money on deposit there lost all their savings.

缺乏银行监管意味着，如果银行破产，那些存入银行的人就会失去所有积蓄。

|-> 城市没有农田, 城市人就没有退路, 可以自己种食物吃

|Hunger was a significant problem, particularly in urban areas where there was little chance of having a garden or finding other available foodstuffs. Homeless camps and shantytowns sprang up, but life in such a place was precarious because city officials might force the residents to leave.

饥饿是一个严重的问题，特别是在城市地区，那里几乎没有机会拥有花园, 或找到其他可用的食物。无家可归者的营地和棚户区, 如雨后春笋般涌现，但这些地方的生活并不稳定，因为城市官员可能会强迫居民离开.

|-> 人民越贫穷, 就造成”共产主义”等极端思想盛行

|The inability of capitalist countries to fully solve their economic problems made ideologies such as communism more attractive.  In countries with capitalist systems, the gap between the “haves” and “have-nots” was particularly stark in the 1930s. The appeal of communist ideology grew among some who felt abandoned by the capitalist system, and the prospect of economic equality was its most attractive feature. In other countries, the economic crisis became an opportunity for increased authoritarianism.

资本主义国家无法完全解决其经济问题，使得共产主义等意识形态更具吸引力。在资本主义制度国家，“富人”与“穷人”之间的差距, 在20世纪30年代尤其明显。"共产主义"意识形态的吸引力, 在一些感到被"资本主义制度"抛弃的人群中越来越大，而"经济平等"的前景是其最有吸引力的特征。在其他国家，经济危机成为"威权主义"抬头的机会。(要"改变原有制度"的想法，导致有病乱投医，极端思想和幻想，都会成为无知人们的选择)

The Communist Party experienced substantial growth in many Western democracies in the early 1930s. For some, communism offered not simply economic parity but the prospect of racial parity as well.

20 世纪 30 年代初，共产党在许多西方民主国家经历了大幅发展. 对于一些人来说， 共产主义不仅(为他们幻想)提供了”经济平等”，还提供了”种族平等”的前景。

=== 如何应对经济危机

There were no easy solutions for any government trying to combat the misery, and different countries adopted different methods to alleviate the suffering of their people.

对于任何试图消除苦难的政府来说，都没有简单的解决办法，不同的国家采取了不同的方法来减轻人民的苦难。

|-> 放弃金本位制度

|Most countries went off the gold standard—a monetary system in which the value of a currency is tied directly to the value of gold—in the early 1930s, but there was no widespread banking collapse as there was in the United States.

大多数国家在 20 世纪 30 年代初放弃了"金本位制"（一种"货币价值"与"黄金价值"直接挂钩的货币体系），但没有像美国那样出现大范围的银行业崩溃。

|-> 日本, 执行内循环

|Japan moved into Manchuria in 1931, setting up the state of Manchukuo there the following year. Seizing the region meant Japan would not have to pay for the items it wanted, such as rice, important during a depression that had limited its exports and thus its income from trade.

1931 年，日本迁入满洲，次年在那里建立"满洲国"。占领该地区意味着日本将不必支付其想要的物品和原材料的费用，例如大米 (即内循环了, 自产自用). 这在经济萧条期间很重要，因为萧条限制了日本的出口，从而限制了其贸易收入。

|-> 发展殖民地经济, 有利于内循环 (让人家富裕起来，他们才有钱买你的商品)

|With the Great Depression came increasing pressure to “do more” with African colonies, as a way for imperial countries to deal with their economic problems. Those that could cultivate greater economic development in the colonies would benefit from increased resources and develop a colonial population with greater buying power for its own goods.

Such development was a slow process in the 1930s, however. The British government enacted a Colonial Development Act at the end of the 1920s that funneled small amounts of money into its African colonies. But larger investments did not flow into Africa until after World War II.

促进殖民地经济发展的国家, 能有利于母国解决经济危机. 因为殖民地经济富余了, 才能为母国提供更多的资源, 原材料等. 并增加殖民地人民购买母国商品的财力.

但, 这种促进过程, 是缓慢的. 英国在 20 年代末颁布了《殖民地发展法案》，向其非洲殖民地注入少量资金。但直到二战后，才有更多的投资流入非洲。

===  经济危机何时结束的

Only the economic stimulation of the onset of World War II brought the world closer to a return of prosperity.

只有第二次世界大战爆发时的经济刺激, 才使世界更接近于恢复繁荣。

It was only in the late 1930s that the French economy turned around, due to an increase in military equipment production.

直到20世纪30年代末，由于军事装备生产的增加，法国经济才出现好转。

==  资源的诅咒

Indeed, they often have more difficulty responding to their domestic needs than countries that are relatively resource-poor. This problem, sometimes dubbed the resource curse, a term coined by British economist Richard Auty in 1993, makes resource-rich countries prone to authoritarianism, high rates of conflict, and low rates of economic growth.

Resource-poor countries typically use citizens’ taxes for the majority of government funding, resulting in greater public scrutiny over how that money is used and governments that are more responsive to public needs.

In contrast, governments in resource-rich countries are able to tap into profit-producing extractive industries like oil production to fund public expenditures. Because that profit is often quite large, opportunities for government corruption abound.

资源的诅咒, 即资源丰富的国家, 更容易陷入独裁主义、高冲突率, 和低经济增长率。原因是: 资源丰富国家, 其政府能利用资源(石油等)产生的利润, 来支付公共支出, 由于不太靠对民间的税收等, 所以政府从中腐败的机会很多. (谁支付你钱，谁是大爷。资源丰富国家，不太靠人民税收，所以也没必要听人民的意见)

而资源匮乏的国家, 其政府只能依靠对公民的税收, 来支付支出, 所以公众就会严格审查政府的行为, 降低了腐败. 并且政府对公众的需求, 响应速度也会更快.

The African country of Angola, rich in diamonds and oil, has struggled with the resource curse. In 2018, oil made up more than 92 percent of its exports, and the oil industry accounted for about a third of its GDP. Much of his power was derived from the oil rents paid to him by oil companies operating in Angola, which he used to oppress his opposition.

比如, 非洲国家安哥拉, 盛产石油和钻石.  2018年，石油工业约占其GDP的三分之一, 石油占其出口的92%以上. 该国统治者用从石油上收到的钱, 来镇压他的反对派，维持他对权力的控制.

'''

==  世界国家的贫富分化情况

As of 2015, approximately 85 percent of the world’s extreme poor (those living on less than $1.90 per day) lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and half of them lived in just five countries: India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ethiopia.

截至 2015 年，世界上约 85% 的极端贫困人口（每天生活费低于 1.90 美元）, 生活在撒哈拉以南非洲, 和南亚. 其中一半人生活在这五个国家：印度、孟加拉国、尼日利亚、民主共和国, 刚果共和国, 埃塞俄比亚。

'''

== 游牧民族的消失

The adoption of guns by societies in Europe, Asia, and Africa was the beginning of the end for some nomadic cultures. Beginning in the early modern era, nomadic societies increasingly began to settle down.

欧洲、亚洲和非洲社会采用枪支, 是造成"一些游牧文化终结"的开始。从近代早期开始，游牧社会开始逐渐定居。

原因:

- The adoption of firearms by settled societies undoubtedly jeopardized the continued existence of nomadic societies.

定居社会采用火器, 无疑危及游牧社会的继续存在。

- Modern nation-states also found it easier to tax people who were not always on the move.

对那些不经常流动的人征税, 更容易.

- Modern nation-states with permanent borders also objected to nomads crossing at will from one nation into another. They forced them to settle.

拥有永久边界的现代民族国家, 也反对游牧民族随意从一个国家进入另一个国家, 并强迫他们定居。

- As industrialization made settled life more comfortable, many nomads willingly abandoned their traditional way of life.

随着工业化使定居生活变得更加舒适，许多游牧民族自愿放弃他们的传统生活方式。
