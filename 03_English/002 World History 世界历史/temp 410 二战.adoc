The Asian and African holdings of the German Empire were also divided among the victors. Some of Germany’s Asian lands had been relinquished early in the war, such as Samoa, which New Zealand formally took over after the war. Australia took German New Guinea and Nauru. The Japanese Empire gained German-held islands north of the equator, such as the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands.

德意志帝国的亚洲和非洲领土也被胜利者瓜分。德国在战争初期就放弃了一些亚洲领土，例如战后新 西兰正式接管的萨摩亚。澳大利亚占领了德属新几内亚和瑙鲁。日本帝国获得了德国控制的赤道以北 岛屿，例如马绍尔群岛和加罗林群岛

Most of Germany’s Asian colonies were occupied by the Allied nations early in the war.

。战争初期，德国的大部分亚洲殖民地被同盟国占领。

No one consulted the African peoples in making these divisions, and in fact the borders cut through ethnic groups, leaving some groups divided between two governments. Self-determination of nations was clearly not at work in Africa, and increasingly louder voices questioned whether Europe had any real moral authority over African colonies.

在进行(非洲的)这些划分时，没有人征求非洲人民的意见，事实上，边界划分 了不同的民族群体，导致一些群体在两个政府之间分裂。国家自决显然在非洲不起作用，越来越多的 声音质疑欧洲对非洲殖民地是否拥有真正的道德权威。

Most Africans were not considered citizens of the empires of which they were part. However, participation in World War I changed things for many Africans. More than one million Africans had fought in the war. The sense that their contribution should be rewarded with new political power was one result. Another was their exposure to international issues and the recognition that the principle of self-determination applied directly to themselves.

大多数非洲人不被视为他们所属帝国的公民。然 而，参加第一次世界大战改变了许多非洲人的生活。超过一百万非洲人参加了这场战争。结果之一就 是他们的贡献应该得到新的政治权力的回报。另一个原因是他们接触国际问题并认识到自决原则直接 适用于他们自己。

A number of groups had begun to argue for more African involvement in colonial governments beginning in the late 1800s.

从 1800 年代末开始，一些团体开始主张非洲更多地参与殖民政府。

With the Great Depression came increasing pressure to “do more” with African colonies, as a way for imperial countries to deal with their economic problems. Those that could cultivate greater economic development in the colonies would benefit from increased resources and develop a colonial population with greater buying power for its own goods. Such development was a slow process in the 1930s, however (Figure 12.16). The British government enacted a Colonial Development Act at the end of the 1920s that funneled small amounts of money into its African colonies. But larger investments did not flow into Africa until after World War II.

随着大萧条的到来，对非洲殖民地“采取更多行动”的压力越来越大，以此作为帝国主义国家解决经济问 题的一种方式。那些能够在殖民地促进更大的经济发展的国家将受益于更多的资源，并培养对自己的 商品具有更大购买力的殖民地人口。然而，这种发展在 20 世纪 30 年代是一个缓慢的过程（图 12.16 ）。英国政府在 20 年代末颁布了《殖民地发展法案》，向其非洲殖民地注入少量资金。但直到第二次 世界大战后，更大的投资才流入非洲。(让人家富裕起来，他们才有钱买你的商品)

Women won the right to vote in the United States in 1920, though it was couched as a reward for their war service. Britain adopted a phase-in approach. First, women over thirty who met a property qualification were given the right to vote in 1918. Then in 1928, the vote was extended to women twenty-one and older. The property qualifications for men were abolished in 1918, and all men twenty-one and older were allowed to vote. For those in the military, the age limit was lowered to nineteen.

1920 年，美国女性赢得了投票权，尽管这被表述为对她们战争服务的奖励。英国采取了分阶段实 施的方式。首先，1918年，三十岁以上符合财产资格的女性获得了投票权。然后在1928年，投票权扩 大到了21岁及以上的女性。 1918年废除了男性的财产资格，所有二十一岁及以上的男性都被允许投 票。对于军人来说，年龄限制降低至十九岁。

Other countries joined the trend. German women won the right to vote in 1918. The new country of Poland extended the vote to women immediately. Other countries still imposed limitations, such as property qualifications or the need to be a war widow in order to vote. France and Italy lagged behind; women could not vote in either country until 1945. In Japan, female activist groups argued for a role in politics throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Japanese law changed to allow women to attend political rallies, but women did not receive the right to vote until after World War II. Rising feminism in China linked to the May Fourth Movement helped women obtain individual property rights under the law.

其他国家也加入了这一趋势。 1918年，德国妇女赢得了选举权。新国家波兰立即将选举权扩大到妇 女。其他国家仍然施加限制，例如财产资格或必须成为战争寡妇才能投票。法国和意大利落后；直到 1945 年，女性才可以在这两个国家投票。在日本，女性活动团体在 20 世纪 20 年代和 1930 年代一直 主张在政治中发挥作用。日本法律修改，允许女性参加政治集会，但女性直到二战后才获得投票权。 与五四运动相关的中国女权主义的兴起帮助妇女依法获得了个人财产权。

Several minority groups in the United States hoped military service would gain them wider acceptance and rights. More than eleven thousand Native Americans served in the military during the war, and many hoped this volunteer service would provide them U.S. citizenship. Native Americans were in fact granted citizenship in 1924. Another group hoping for change were African Americans. Long subject to discriminatory laws and racial segregation, African Americans felt World War I offered them an opportunity to prove themselves loyal citizens. The United States operated a segregated military, and all-Black service member units serving overseas had a unique chance to see how other places treated them. Those in France, in particular, were struck by the freedom of movement and acceptance they found there. They were allowed in combat, while U.S. units kept them largely in support roles. There was genuine optimism that life in the United States would be different after the war.

美国的一些少数群体希望服兵役能让他们获得更广泛的接受和权利。战争期间，超过一万名美洲原住 民在军队服役，许多人希望这种志愿服务能让他们获得美国公民身份。事实上，美洲原住民在 1924 年 就获得了公民身份。另一个希望改变的群体是非裔美国人。长期受到歧视性法律和种族隔离的影响， 非裔美国人认为第一次世界大战为他们提供了证明自己忠诚公民的机会。美国实行种族隔离的军队， 在海外服役的全黑人军人部队有独特的机会了解其他地方如何对待他们。尤其是法国人，他们对那里 的行动自由和接受程度感到震惊。他们被允许参加战斗，而美军部队则让他们主要担任支援角色。人 们真正乐观地认为战后美国的生活将会有所不同。

However, after 1918, many found that little had changed. Discriminatory laws remained in place, and poor treatment even of veterans was commonplace. In 1917, the lure of good-paying industrial jobs producing items for the war began drawing African American workers and families north. By 1920, more than a million African Americans had left the south in a Great Migration, which continued through the next decades as well. Northern racism seemed mild compared to what African Americans’ southern experience had been.

然而，1918 年之后，许多人发现情况几乎没有改变。歧视性法律仍然存在，甚至对退伍军人的恶劣待 遇也很常见。1917 年，为战争生产物品的高薪工业工作岗位的诱惑开始吸引 非裔美国工人和家庭向北迁移。到 1920 年，超 过一百万非裔美国人在一场大迁徙中离开了南方，这场大迁徙也持续了接下来的几十年。与非洲裔美国人南方的经历相比，北方的种族主义似乎温 和.

The dismantling of empires at the end of the war was clearly a boon for democracy, but it was not always easy for fledgling countries to adopt new political systems.

战争结束时帝国的瓦解显然是民主的福音，但对于新兴国家来说，采用新的政治制度并不总是那么容 易。

Japan also took steps toward becoming more democratic for a brief period after World War I. In 1912, a new emperor, Taisho, had ushered in a period of liberalism with democratic and progressive politics. For example, labor strikes became increasingly common as workers fought for better wages and working conditions. Women became active in labor unions and politics for the first time, and the number of unions more than tripled in the 1910s. During this period, Japan was viewed as a triumph of constitutional government.

日本在第一次世界大战后的短暂时期内也采取了变得更加民主的措施。1912年，新天皇大正开创了一 个政治民主进步的自由主义时期。例如，随着工人们争取更好的工资和工作条件，劳工罢工变得越来 越普遍。妇女首次积极参与工会 和政治，工会数量在 1910 年代增加了两倍多。这一时期的日本被视为宪政的胜利。

However, the progressive period did not last long. In 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, destroyed two major cities, Yokohama and Tokyo. Rumors quickly spread that Koreans in the area were taking advantage of the chaos, were plotting political insurrection, and had already poisoned wells to contaminate the drinking water. The devastation also provided an opportunity for the conservative and pro-military forces in the Japanese government to exercise increased control over society. Martial law was declared, and the repression of radicals was stepped up. Political activists who questioned government policies disappeared.

然而，进步时期并没有持续多久。 1923年，里氏7.8级关东大地震摧毁了横滨和东京两个主要城市。。谣言很快传开，称该地区的朝鲜人正在 趁乱策划政治叛乱，并已在水井中投毒污染了饮用水。这 次灾难还为日本政府中的保守派和亲军势力提供了加强对社会控制的机会。宣布戒严，加强镇压激进 分子。质疑政府政策的政治活动人士消失了。

When the emperor died in 1926, his son Hirohito ascended to power, and the Shöwa period began. Japan’s political system now became increasingly dominated by the military, and the emperor’s role was shrouded in secrecy and worship. The country’s military leaders believed more aggressive actions were needed for Japan to control the Pacific as they wanted to.

1926 年天皇去世，其子裕仁继位，昭和时代开始。日本的政治体系现在越来越由军队主导，天皇的角 色被笼罩在秘密和崇拜之中。该国军事领导人认为，日本需要采取更积极的行动才能按照他们的意愿 控制太平洋。(战狼派，鹰派)

Japan’s military establishment and certain factions of its army became increasingly contemptuous of civilian leaders. By the late 1920s, they saw these politicians as incapable of solving domestic issues or addressing challenges from China and the Soviet Union. Some disaffected Japanese field commanders in China and the Japanese colony of Korea began to engage in direct actions.

日本军队及其军队的某些派系越来越蔑视文职领导人。到了 1920 年代 末，他们认为这些政客没有能力解决国内问题或应对来自中国和苏联的挑战。一些不满的日本驻中国 和日本殖民地朝鲜战地指挥官开始采取直接行动

Manchuria was a semiautonomous province of China. In 1931, to precipitate a political crisis that would enable Japan to intervene, hyper-patriots in the Japanese army conspired to blow up a portion of the South Manchurian Railway near the Manchurian city of Mukden (Shenyang) and blamed the incident on Chinese nationalists. The local Japanese commander took the opportunity to occupy Mukden, and field commanders in Korea dispatched reinforcements without any orders from Tokyo to do so. Japanese public opinion supported the army’s action.

满洲是中国的一个半自治省。 1931年，为了引发一场政治危机，以便日本能够进行干 预，日本军队中的超级爱国者密谋炸毁了满洲城市奉天（沉阳）附近的南满铁路的一部分，并将这一 事件归咎于中国民族主义者。日本当地指挥官趁机占领了奉天，朝鲜战地指挥官在没有得到东京命令 的情况下就派出了增援部队。日本舆论支持军队的行动。

As the Chinese government called for the League of Nations to intervene and pledged to accept its rulings, a British diplomat in Japan warned of “an atmosphere of gun-grease” in Japan.

当中国政府呼吁国际联盟进行干预并承诺接受其裁决时，一名英国驻日本外交 官对日本的“油脂气氛”发出警告。

In the fall of 1931, the League established the Lytton Commission to look into the situation. In January 1932, U.S. secretary of state Henry Stimson announced the Stimson Doctrine, which refused to recognize Manchukuo as an independent state.

1931 年秋，联盟成立了利顿委员会来调查这一情况。 1932年1月，美国国务卿史汀生宣布“史汀生主 义” ，拒绝承认满洲国为独立国家。

Chinese public opinion was aroused, and in January 1932, clashes erupted between Japanese marines and Chinese troops in the outskirts of Shanghai.

Japan formally recognized the establishment of Manchukuo, its client state (a subordinate and dependent area), as a theoretically free, completely sovereign, and independent nation. The Lytton Report, published in October 1932, found fault on both sides but did not recommend full autonomy for Manchukuo. Japan responded by withdrawing from the League in March 1933.

中国舆论被激起，1932年1月，日本海军陆战队与中国军队在上海郊区爆发冲突。日本正式承认满洲国的建立，其 附属国（附属地区） ，作为一个理论上自由、完全主权、独立的国家。 1932 年 10 月发 表的《利顿报告》指出双方都有过错，但没有建议满洲国完全自治。作为回应，日本于 1933 年 3 月退 出了同盟。

The Japanese secret societies within the military were animated by an exaggerated sense of Japan’s destiny. They began a campaign of violence against the Japanese civilian government. Elements of the Imperial Navy launched a coup in March 1932 by executing Japan’s former finance minister, Junnosuke Inoue, and Baron Dan, the head of Mitsui Corporation, as traitors to the Japanese people. On May 15, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was shot to death by eleven young naval officers. Between 1930 and 1935, the Japanese witnessed twenty terrorist incidents, the assassination of four political leaders, the attempted murders of five others, and four coup attempts.

日本军队内部的秘密社团因对日本命运的夸张认识而活跃起来。他们开始了针对日本文官政府的暴力 运动。 1932年3月，帝国海军发动政变，将日本前财务大臣井上淳之介和三井物产公司总裁丹男爵作 为日本人民的叛徒处决。 5月15日，首相犬养刚被11名年轻海军军官枪杀。 1930 年至 1935 年间，日 本目睹了 20 起恐怖事件、四名政治领导人被暗杀、另外五人被谋杀未遂以及四次政变企图。

In the first half of the twentieth century, the dominant political party in Japan was a fusion of Meiji oligarchs, government bureaucrats, and recruits from other political parties. The Seiyukai, as it was named, consistently supported a march toward authoritarian government. Beginning in 1932, “national unity” governments dominated by high-ranking military officers increasingly assumed power and repressed threats and enemies. Authoritarian government took hold from the top down in the mid-1930s, as the military intimidated and overpowered civilian governance and created a military dictatorship.

二十世纪上半叶，日本的主导政党是明治寡头、政府官僚和其他政党新成员的融合体。正如其名称所 示，政友会始终支持走向独裁政府。从 1932 年开始，由高级军官主导的“民族团结”政府越来越多地掌 握权力并镇压威胁和敌人。 20 世纪 30 年代中期，独裁政府自上而下掌权，军队威吓和压制文官政 府，建立了军事独裁政权。

The devastation and dislocations of World War I were so profound that much of Europe was hardpressed to recover in its aftermath. Through the tumultuous 1920s, voters worldwide looked to authoritative leaders and parties to solve their country’s problems. This tendency spawned a new approach to governance in the form of fascism and totalitarianism. The resulting regimes propelled the world to a bloodier and more devastating sequel to World War I—World War II. The second global conflict in less than half a century began with Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939 and Britain and France’s decision to oppose it. By the summer of 1940, western Europe had fallen to German armies, and in 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union.

第一次世界大战造成的破坏和混乱是如此严重，以至于欧洲大部分地区都难以在战后恢复。在动荡的 20 年代，世界各地的选民都指望权威领导人和政党来解决国家的问题。这种趋势催生了法西斯主义和 极权主义形式的新治理方式。由此产生的政权将世界 推向第一次世界大战的更血腥、更具破坏性的续集——第二次世界大战。不到半个世纪的第二次全球 冲突始于1939年德国入侵波兰，英国和法国决定反对。到1940年夏天，西欧已落入德国军队之手， 1941年，德国入侵苏联。

The attempts by Western nations to build a structure of world peace with the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations ultimately unraveled during the 1930s. National and international grievances, competing ideologies, and economic self-interest all hammered away at the fragile international order.

西方国家通过《凡尔赛条约》和国际联盟建立世界和平架构的尝试最终在20世纪30年代破裂。国内和 国际的不满、意识形态的竞争以及经济自身利益都对脆弱的国际秩序造成了沉重打击。

On May 22, 1933, the Japanese and China’s Guomindang government (GMD, also spelled “Kuomintang”) concluded the Tanggu Truce, forming a demilitarized zone that stretched one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall and essentially detached Manchukuo from the nation of China.

1933 年 5 月 22 日，日本和中国国民党政府（GMD，也拼写“国民党”）缔结了 《塘沽停战协定》 ，形成了一个绵延长城以南 100 公里的非军事区，基本上将满洲国从这个国家中分 离出来。

The nationalist GMD government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had been fighting a civil war since 1927.

In December 1936, during the so-called Xian Incident, Chiang Kai-shek was taken prisoner in Xian, China, by Manchurian forces and forced to negotiate a cessation of the Civil War and the creation of the Second United Front—unifying the GMD and the CCP against Japan.

国民党政府和中国共产党自 1927 年以来一直在打内战。1936 年 12 月，在所 谓的西安事变期间，蒋介石在中国西安被满洲军队俘虏，并被迫谈判停止内战和建立第二统一战线 ——统一国民党和国民党。中共针对日本。

Tensions in North China escalated early in July 1937, as Japanese troops were conducting night exercises near the Marco Polo Bridge ten miles west of Beijing and firefights erupted between them and Chinese troops. The Japanese quickly overcame the Chinese forces and secured their control of the area around Beijing and Tianjin.

1937 年 7 月，华北的紧张局势升级，当时日本军队正在北京以西 10 英里的卢沟桥附近进行夜间演 习，他们与中国军队之间爆发了交火。日本人很快就战胜了中国军队，并控制了北京和天津周边地 区。

Chiang Kai-shek then decided to shift the fighting to the Shanghai region, where he had better forces and a seeming numerical advantage. The Japanese responded by mounting a major offensive, and by November 1937, the GMD forces had been badly mauled. After losing 250,000 troops, they retreated westward to China’s capital in Nanjing. Japanese forces closed in on Nanjing, and Chinese troops continued to retreat westward. On December 12, 1937, Chinese resistance at Nanjing ceased, and Japanese troops entered the defenseless city, commencing a terrifying sevenweek reign of terror and plunder. The tragedy became known as the “Rape of Nanking” (the older spelling of Nanjing) and was taken up at the Tokyo War Crimes trials after the war.

蒋介石随后决定将战斗转移到上海地区，因为他在那里拥有更好的兵力和表面上的数量优势。作为回 应，日本发动了大规模进攻，到 1937 年 11 月，国民党军队已遭到严重打击。在损失25万军队后，他 们向西撤退到中国首都南京。日军逼近南京，中国军队继续向西撤退。 1937 年 12 月 12 日，中国在 南京的抵抗停止，日军进入这座毫无防备的城市，开始了长达七周的恐怖和掠夺统治. 这场悲剧被称为“南京大屠杀”（南京的旧拼写），并在 东京战争罪审判中受到关注。战争。

Having retreated farther west to defend the GMD’s new provisional capital at Chongqing, some GMD armies put up stiff resistance in places, but by 1938, they had been pushed back significantly. To prevent further Japanese advances, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River, flooding large portions of central China, killing an estimated 400,000 people and dislocating ten million more.

为保卫国民党在重庆的新陪都重庆后，部分国民党军队向西撤退，在一些地 方进行了顽强抵抗，但到了1938年，他们已被大幅击退。为了阻止日本进一步进攻，蒋介石下令打开 黄河堤坝，洪水淹没了中国中部的大部分地区，估计造成 40 万人死亡，1000 万人流离失所。

Through all this, public opinion in the United States, while increasingly shifting in favor of China, was still undecided about entering any war.

经过这一切，美国的公众舆论虽然越来越有利于中国，但仍未决定是否参加任何战 争。

Eventually, finding themselves in a stalemate in China and needing more natural resources to sustain the war and the goal of creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese military and civilian governments began to consider a thrust into Southeast Asia. Such a move would inevitably mean a confrontation with the United States and its colony the Philippines.

最终，由于发现自己在中国陷入了僵局，需要更多的自然资源来维持战争和创建大东亚共荣圈的目 标，日本军民政府开始考虑进军东南亚。此举将不可避免地意味着与美国及其殖民地菲律宾的对抗。

In furtherance of his promise to revive Italian glory, Benito Mussolini (popularly known as Il Duce, “the leader”) sought to expand the Italian protectorate of Somali in East Africa. A border dispute with Ethiopia, which Italy had long sought to colonize, arose in November 1934, and the Ethiopians took the matter to the League of Nations on January 5, 1935. When a full-scale Italian invasion of Ethiopia began on October 3 of that year, the League Council immediately declared Italy the aggressor, and fifty-one member nations approved sanctions against Italy. Unwilling to defy Mussolini, however, the British and French undermined the League in a secret agreement permitting Italy to absorb Ethiopia into a special economic zone. In May 1936, Italian forces took the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, and shortly thereafter, Italy formally annexed the country. In Italy, Mussolini’s popularity grew, especially among Italian youth.

为了兑现重振意大利辉煌的承诺，贝尼托·墨索里尼（俗称“领袖”）寻求扩大意大利在东非的索马里保 护国。 1934 年 11 月，与意大利长期寻求殖民的埃塞俄比亚发生边界争端，埃塞俄比亚人于 1935 年 1 月 5 日将此事提交国际联盟。意大利于 10 月 3 日开始全面入侵埃塞俄比亚。那一年，国联理事会立即 宣布意大利为侵略者，五十一个成员国批准对意大利实施制裁。然而，英国和法国不愿反抗墨索里 尼，而是通过一项允许意大利将埃塞俄比亚纳入经济特区的秘密协议破坏了国联。 1936年5月，意大 利军队占领埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴，不久后，意大利正式吞并该国。在意大利，墨索里尼的受 欢迎程度不断上升，尤其是在意大利年轻人中。

Britain and France were even more reluctant to confront Germany. Adolf Hitler had often pledged to scrap the Treaty of Versailles. His first step came just nine months after becoming chancellor when he conducted referenda to let the German people decide whether they wanted to remain in the League of Nations. The result was predictable, and in October 1933, Germany withdrew from the League.

英国和法国更不愿意与德国对抗。阿道夫·希特勒经常承诺废除《凡尔赛条约》。他的第一步是在就任 总理九个月后举行的，当时他进行了全民公投，让德国人民决定是否留在国际联盟。结果是可以预见 的，1933年10月，德国退出了国联。

By the 1930s, some in Britain and elsewhere had come to view Hitler as a deeply patriotic German seeking merely to serve the interests of his battered nation. Others saw him and his politics as potentially dangerous and unsettling to European stability. The British government did, however, negotiate with Germany to contain the size of the German navy, and France sought a Treaty of Mutual Assistance with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Using the French-Soviet cooperation as an excuse, in March 1935 Hitler publicly announced that Germany had already secretly begun to rearm in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles. On March 2, 1936, about three thousand German troops reoccupied the Rhineland, a part of Germany demilitarized by the Treaty. France feared protesting this too strongly because it did not want and was not ready to fight another war. The British public did not see the move as overtly hostile.

到了 20 世纪 30 年代，英国和其他地方的一些人开始将希特勒视为一位深深爱国的德国人，只想为饱 受摧残的国家的利益服务。其他人则认为他和他的政治对欧洲稳定具有潜在危险和不安。然而，英国 政府确实与德国进行了谈判，以遏制德国海军的规模，而法国则寻求与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟 （苏联）签订互助条约 (资本主义与共产主义都视法西斯主义为竞争对手)。 1935年3月，希特勒以法苏合作为借口，公开宣布德国已无视《凡尔赛条 约》，秘密开始重新武装。 1936 年 3 月 2 日，大约三千名德国军队重新占领了莱茵兰，这是德国根据 条约非军事化的一部分。法国担心抗议过于强烈，因为它不想也没有准备好打另一场战争。英国公众 并不认为此举具有明显的敌意。

Though the Versailles Treaty specifically prohibited unification of Austria with Germany, Hitler moved to accomplish this anyway. Austria’s prime minister attempted to stave off unification by calling for a referendum in March, but the next day Hitler preemptively sent troops into Austria. When the referendum was held, the people voted for union with Germany. Flush with his victory over Austria, Hitler continued to “gather the German people,” and his eyes turned to those portions of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland, containing some three million ethnic Germans, including many who had been folded into that nation by the Treaty of Versailles.

尽管《凡尔赛条约》明确禁止奥地利与德国统一，但希特勒还是采取了行动来实现这一目标。奥地利 总理试图在三月份呼吁举行全民公投来阻止统一，但第二天希特勒就先发制人地向奥地利派遣军队。 公投举行时，人们投票支持与德国合并。希特勒因战胜奥地利而红红火火，他继续“聚集德国人民”，他 的目光转向了捷克斯洛伐克的苏台德地区，那里居住着大约三百万德意志人，其中许多人是根据《捷 克斯洛伐克条约》并入该国的。凡尔赛宫。(都占领该国了，当然支持公投合并了)

The Czechoslovaks, in the only real democracy created by the Treaty of Versailles, pinned their hopes for defense against Germany on the western nations and on treaties for mutual defense signed with France in the 1920s and early 1930s. Sudeten Germans had organized their own Nazi Party, however, and began agitating to join Germany. By 1938, it seemed that Britain and France were most concerned with avoiding another major war, so to defuse the situation, the Czechoslovak government granted the Sudeten Germans self-government. Tensions grew. As Hitler pressed for full inclusion of the Sudetenland in Germany and war seemed on the horizon, British prime minister Neville Chamberlain flew to Germany to meet with him. Hitler seemed prepared for war. Instead, Chamberlain proposed to hold a general conference to address the crisis over the Sudetenland, and Hitler agreed.

捷克斯洛伐克人在《凡尔赛条约》所创造的唯一真正的民主国家中，将防御德国的希望寄托在西方国 家以及1920年代和1930年代初与法国签署的共同防御条约上。然而，苏台德德国人组织了自己的纳粹 党，并开始鼓动加入德国。到了 1938 年，英国和法国似乎最关心的是避免另一场重大战争，因此为了 缓和局势，捷克斯洛伐克政府授予苏台德德国人自治权。紧张局势加剧。当希特勒敦促将苏台德地区 完全纳入德国，战争似乎一触即发时，英国首相内维尔·张伯伦飞往德国与他会面。希特勒似乎已经做 好了战争准备。相反，张伯伦提议召开一次大会来解决苏台德地区的危机，希特勒同意了。

The Munich Conference was attended by Chamberlain, Hitler, French prime minister Édouard Daladier, and Mussolini (ostensibly a neutral party but one who had already assured Hitler of his support). On September 30, they produced the Munich Pact, in which Czechoslovakia granted territorial concessions to Germany, Poland, and Hungary in what has since been called appeasement. The hope of Great Britain and France was that Hitler would be satisfied and cease to be aggressive. The alternative meant fighting Germany, which neither government wanted.

张伯伦、希特勒、法国总理爱德华·达拉第和墨索里尼（表面上是中立党，但已经向希特勒保证支持） 出席了慕尼黑会议。 9 月 30 日，他们制定了《慕尼黑条约》 ，捷克斯洛伐克在其中向德国、波兰和匈 牙利授予领土让步，此后称为绥靖政策。英国和法国的希望是希特勒会满意并停止侵略。 另一种选择意味着与德国作战，而这正是两国政府都不希望发生的。

The Western world had not yet decided which was the greater threat to world peace, a fascist Germany or the communist Soviet Union. Some political conservatives in England and France hoped for a German alliance against the Soviets, as did Hitler. The British military was not confident of its preparedness for war, and the isolationist policy of the United States diminished the hope of any aid from Washington. With anxiety growing in London over Britain’s possessions in Asia and Japanese aggressions there, domestic support for negotiated solutions was widespread among liberals, and a bargain with Hitler seemed a reasonable policy. In the ensuing weeks, German troops entered the relinquished areas, and by the spring of 1939, Germany had gone on to absorb the rest of Czechoslovakia.

西方世界尚未决定法西斯德国和共产主义苏联哪个对世界和平构成更大的威胁。英国和法国的一些政 治保守派希望德国结盟对抗苏联，希特勒也是如此。英国军方对其战备能力缺乏信心，而美国的孤立 主义政策也削弱了华盛顿提供援助的希望。随着伦敦对英国在亚洲的领土和日本在亚洲的侵略的焦虑 日益加剧，国内自由派普遍支持通过谈判解决问题，与希特勒讨价还价似乎是一个合理的政策。在接 下来的几周内，德国军队进入了被放弃的地区，到 1939 年春天，德国已经吞并了捷克斯洛伐克的其余 地区。

During these years, the Nazis were progressively implementing increasingly severe persecutions of Jewish people. First, a law enacted on April 7, 1933, banned them from positions in the civil service. That same year, the first and longest-surviving Nazi concentration camp, Dachau, was set up near Munich, intended for political prisoners. Several laws collectively known as the Nuremberg Laws were promulgated in 1935, institutionalizing Nazi racial theories and discrimination against Jewish people. A Jewish person was defined as anyone with three Jewish grandparents, regardless of whether they were active in the Jewish religious community or how deeply they identified as German. Jewish people were denied citizenship in the new Nazi-led German empire, called the Third Reich, and were forbidden to marry or have sexual relations with ethnic Germans, designated as “Aryans.” They lost the right to vote and most other political rights.

这些年来，纳粹对犹太人的迫害日益严厉。首先，1933 年 4 月 7 日颁布的一项法律禁止他们担任公务 员职务。同年，第一个也是现存时间最长的纳粹集中营达豪集中营在慕尼黑附近建立，用于关押政治 犯。 1935 年颁布了几部统称为《纽伦堡法》的法律，将纳粹种族理论和对犹太人的歧视 制度化。犹太人被定义为具有三个犹太祖父母的任何人，无论他们是否活跃于犹太宗教社区，或者他 们对德国人的认同程度如何。在纳粹领导的新德意志帝国（称为第三帝国）中，犹太人被剥夺了公民 身份，并被禁止与被称为“雅利安人”的德国人结婚或发生性关系。他们失去了投票权和大多数其他政治 权利。

Two days of violent attacks on them in November 1938, ignited by the assassination of a German diplomat in Paris by a Polish Jewish man, became known as Kristallnacht, the “Night of Broken Glass.” Almost every synagogue in Germany was torched during the rampage, as well as 90 percent of Jewish-owned businesses. Some thirty thousand Jewish males were taken into custody and sent to Dachau.

1938 年 11 月，一名德国驻巴黎外交官被一名波兰犹太人暗杀，引发了为期两天的暴力袭击，被称为“水晶 之夜”。德国几乎所有的犹太教堂以及 90% 的犹太人拥有的企业都在这场暴乱中被烧毁。大约三万名 犹太男性被拘留并送往达豪(集中营)

Kristallnacht caused a severe deterioration in Germany’s international standing. In Britain, an outraged public pressured Parliament into allowing unaccompanied Jewish children under seventeen to take refuge in England. During the nine months before the war, this Kindertransport may have rescued as many as ten thousand children. Across Europe, many Jewish people became refugees as they fled the oppressive politics of the Nazis. A thirty-two-nation international conference was held in France during the summer of 1938 to solve the Jewish refugee crisis, but no country stepped forward to accept any such immigrants. In February 1939, a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress to allow ten thousand Jewish children to enter the country in 1939 and another ten thousand in 1940. Though popular, the bill failed due to lukewarm political support.

水晶之夜导致德国的国际地位严重恶化。在英国，愤怒的公众向议会施压，要求允许十七岁以下无人 陪伴的犹太儿童在英国避难。在战前的九个月里，这个幼儿园运输可能已经拯救了多达一万名儿童。 在整个欧洲，许多犹太人因逃离纳粹的压迫政治而成为难民。 1938年夏天，法国召开了一次三十二国 国际会议来解决犹太难民危机，但没有一个国家站出来接受此类移民。 1939 年 2 月，美国国会提出一 项法案，允许 1939 年允许 1 万名犹太儿童进入美国，并在 1940 年再允许 1 万名犹太儿童进入美国。 该法案虽然很受欢迎，但由于政治支持冷淡而失败。

In Asia, Shanghai was an option for Jewish refugees looking for a new home. The city, along with Franco’s Spain, was unconditionally open to Jewish migration. Nominally still a German ally in 1939, the Nationalist government in the southwestern corner of China formulated a plan to provide a haven for European Jewish refugees. It had multiple reasons for doing so, including attracting international Jewish support and gaining favor with Britain and the United States against Japan. A number of schemes were hatched, both by members of the GMD government and by private individuals, one even gaining the support of scientist Albert Einstein. GMD diplomats in Europe like Feng Shan Ho, consul general in Vienna, issued visas to Jewish refugees seeking to relocate to Shanghai. A Jewish community of more than twenty thousand displaced persons had reached the city by the end of the war.

在亚洲，上海是犹太难民寻找新家的一个选择。这座城市与佛朗哥统治下的西班牙一样，无条件地向 犹太人移民开放。 1939 年，中国西南角的国民党政府名义上仍是德国盟友，制定了一项为欧洲犹太难 民提供避难所的计划。它这样做有多种原因，包括吸引国际犹太人的支持以及赢得英国和美国对日本 的青睐。国民党政府成员和私人策划了一系列计划，其中一项计划甚至得到了科学家阿尔伯特·爱因斯 坦的支持。国民党驻欧洲外交官，如驻维也纳总领事何凤山，向寻求移居上海的犹太难民发放了签 证。战争结束时，由两万多名流离失所者组成的犹太社区已抵达该市。

The ambition to expand eastward had motivated Germany for some time. The hunt for Lebensraum, or living space, had fueled its search for overseas colonies in the late 1800s and was an express goal of World War I. In the lands seized from countries in eastern Europe, Hitler envisioned German families settling and producing large numbers of children, supplanting the native Slavic populations. In this way, physically and culturally “superior” Germans would reclaim Europe from “inferior” Jewish and Slavic peoples. Similar ideologies meant to rationalize the displacement of a territory’s residents by a supposedly superior population have appeared in history before, like Manifest Destiny in the United States and Japan’s expansionist policies in Korea and Manchuria. To the east of Germany, the Treaty of Versailles had created an independent Poland and awarded parts of Germany to Poland in the process. This “Polish Corridor,” in an area where many Polish people already lived, was intended to give Poland access to a port, and the German city of Danzig (Gdańsk), bordering it, was made a semi-independent city-state with its own parliament. Poland was a prime target of the Nazis as they looked for Lebensraum.

一段时间以来，向东扩张的雄心一直激励着德国。对“生存空间”（Lebensraum ）（即生存空间）的 追求推动了 1800 年代末期对海外殖民地的寻找，也是第一次世界大战的明确目标。希特勒设想德国家 庭在从东欧国家夺取的土地上定居并生产大量的土地。儿童，取代了当地的斯拉夫人口。通过这种方 式，在身体和文化上“优越”的德国人将从“劣等”的犹太民族和斯拉夫民族手中夺回欧洲。历史上也曾出 现过类似的意识形态，旨在合理化所谓的优越人口对领土居民的流离失所，例如美国的“天命论”以及日 本在朝鲜和满洲的扩张主义政策。在德国东部，凡尔赛条约创建了一个独立的波兰，并在此过程中将 德国的部分领土授予波兰。这条“波兰走廊”位于许多波兰人已经居住的地区，旨在让波兰能够进入港 口，而与其接壤的德国城市但泽（格但斯克）则成为一个半独立的城邦，其自己的议会。 波兰是纳粹寻找生存空间的首要目标。

Access to the Sea. The twenty-mile-wide Polish Corridor was meant to give Poland access to a port after World War I, separating two parts of Germany in order to do so.

出海通道。二十英里宽的波兰走廊原本是为了让波兰在第一次世界大战后 能够进入港口，从而将德国分为两部分。

The lessons learned from Hitler’s violation of the Munich Pact spurred Britain and France to take action to protect Poland. They have also been invoked by world leaders ever since, whenever the aggression of one nation threatens the sovereignty or the territorial integrity of another. Using the example of Munich to warn against the perils of allowing one nation to invade another without opposition, whether it be Hitler’s Germany or Putin’s Russia, is known as invoking the Munich Analogy.

希特勒违反慕尼黑条约的教训促使英国和法国采取行动保护波兰。从那时起，每当一个国家的侵略威 胁到另一个国家的主权或领土完整时，世界领导人就会援引这些原则。用慕尼黑的例子来警告不要允 许一个国家在没有反对的情况下入侵另一个国家的危险，无论是希特勒的德国还是普京的俄罗斯，被 称为援引慕尼黑类比。

The key to whether Germany could be boxed in was the attitudes of Stalin and the Soviet Union. As early as the summer of 1938, Stalin began to think of making some sort of deal with Germany.

Stalin, aware of Hitler’s musings in his book Mein Kampf, understood the long-term threat Germany posed and sought to buy time to prepare for possible war. For his part, Hitler wanted to avoid Germany’s World War I mistake of fighting on two fronts simultaneously. The result was the German- Soviet Nonaggression Pact of August 23, 1939. In this pact, Germany and the USSR agreed not to attack one another or to assist other nations in attacking the other. Included in the agreement were secret protocols that essentially divided eastern Europe between Germany and the Soviet Union. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and parts of eastern Poland were allocated to the USSR as a reward for cooperating with Germany in the dismemberment of Poland.

德国能否被围困，关键在于斯大林和苏联的态度。早在1938年夏天，斯大林就开始考虑与德国达成某 种协议。斯大林在他的著作《我的奋斗》中意识到希 特勒的沉思，了解德国构成的长期威胁，并寻求争取时间为可能的战争做好准备。就希特勒而言，他 希望避免德国在第一 次世界大战中同时在两条战线上作战的错误。结果是 1939 年 8 月 23 日签订了德 苏互不侵犯条约。在该条约中，德国和苏联同意互不攻击，也不协助其他国家攻击对方。该协议中包 含的秘密协议基本上将东欧划分为德国和苏联。立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚和波兰东部部分地区被 分配给苏联，作为与德国合作瓜分波兰的奖励。

Seeing the pact as an ominous green light for a German eastward thrust, two days later Britain signed a mutual defense agreement with Poland. All things seemed ready for the German onslaught, which was launched on September 1, 1939. Britain and France fulfilled their commitment to Poland and declared war on Germany, forming the partnership known as the Allies, but not on the Soviet Union. About two weeks later, Soviet forces invaded Poland from the east. Crushed from two sides, Poland essentially ceased to exist. The European fires of World War II had been ignited.

两天后，英国与波兰签署了共同防御协议，该协议为德国东进打开了不祥的绿灯。 1939 年 9 月 1 日， 德国发起猛攻，一切似乎都已做好准备。英国和法国履行了对波兰的承诺，向德国宣战，形成了被称 为同盟国的伙伴关系，但没有对苏联。大约两周后，苏联军队从东部入侵波兰。波兰从两侧被压垮， 基本上不复存在。第二次世界大战的欧洲战火已经被点燃。
