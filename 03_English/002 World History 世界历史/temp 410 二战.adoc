John Maynard Keynes, the creator of Keynesian economics, was a British economist at the Paris
Peace Conference in 1919. He was so unsettled by the potential financial repercussions of the
treaty’s terms that he wrote a book contending the large reparations would mean economic ruin for
Germany, endangering the entire European economy. His predictions were soon borne out.


凯恩斯主义经济学的创始人约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯 (John Maynard Keynes)是 1919 年巴黎和会的英国经
济学家。他对该条约条款可能造成的经济影响感到非常不安，因此写了一本书，认为巨额赔款将意味
着德国的经济毁灭，危及整个欧洲经济。他的预言很快就得到了证实。


Germany faced numerous problems as the 1920s began. It was not only blamed for the war, but its
foreign financial assets had also been seized under the treaty, further compromising its economic
power, and it had been physically diminished when many rich industrial areas were cut away from its
territory. Thus, one of the immediate problems facing the new democratic Weimar Republic
government was finding a way to pay the reparations.

20 年代伊始，德国面临着众多问题。它不仅被指责为战争的罪魁祸首，而且它的外国金融资产也根据
该条约被没收，进一步损害了它的经济实力，而且当许多富裕的工业区从其领土上被切断时，它的经
济实力也被削弱了。因此，新民主主义魏玛共和国政府面临的首要问题之一就是如何支付赔款。

The first payment came due in 1921, but Germany was unable to fund the full amount, and the
unresolved issue about how to enforce the treaty terms resurfaced. The next year, 1922, Germany
defaulted on its payments to France and Britain. In response, French and Belgian troops occupied
the Ruhr Valley, the center of German iron, coal, and steel production, as a means to force
repayment.

第一次付款于 1921 年到期，但德国无法全额提供资金，关于如何执行条约条款的悬而未决的问题再次
浮出水面。第二年，即 1922 年，德国拖欠了对法国和英国的付款。作为回应，法国和比利时军队占领
了德国钢铁、煤炭和钢铁生产中心鲁尔河谷，作为强制偿还的手段。


To reach an immediate solution, Germany began simply printing more money. But this created an
inflationary cycle, and the economy soon proved incapable of keeping up with the hyperinflation that
resulted. Holding a job seemed ludicrous when pay could not keep up with a
rate of inflation that increased by the day. The entire German middle class saw their savings
disappear, and with their money went their support of the government.

为了立即解决问题，德国开始印更多的钱。但这造成了通货膨胀周期，很快事实证明经济无法跟上由
此产生的恶性通货膨胀。当工资跟不上日益增长的通货膨胀率时，继续工作
似乎是可笑的。整个德国中产阶级的储蓄都消失了，他们对政府的支持也随之消失。


In 1924, the United States intervened by arranging the Dawes Plan, by which Germany’s installment
payments were lowered but set to increase in the future as its economy rebounded. Foreign banks,
many in the United States, also loaned Germany money to stabilize its inflationary economy. This
enabled Germany to make its payments, but it also meant taking on more debt. In essence, U.S.
banks were loaning money to Germany that it was using to pay Britain and France, which in turn
used that money to pay back their own debts to the United States.

1924年，美国进行干预，制定了道斯计划，降低了德国的分期付款额，但随着经济反弹，未来分期付
款额将增加。外国银行（其中许多位于美国）也向德国提供贷款，以稳定其通货膨胀的经济。这使得
德国能够支付债务，但也意味着承担更多债务。从本质上讲，美国银行向德国借钱，德国用这些钱来
支付英国和法国的费用，而英国和法国又用这笔钱偿还自己欠美国的债务。(也就是说, 英法让德国去借入钱, 来还给英法. 就相当于德国要还两份钱, 分别给英法和美国. 给英法的那份也是从美国借入的, 就相当于德国要还给美国两份钱. )



Reparations continued to present an extreme economic hardship for Germany. In 1929, the United
States announced a new proposal. The Young Plan stretched German reparations across a fiftynine–
year payment schedule, slightly lowered the total to $29 billion, and arranged hundreds of
millions of dollars’ worth of additional loans. Germany continued to make payments until 1932, when
the worldwide Great Depression made it untenable to continue. Later agreements canceled more of
the remaining debt, and the last payment was finally made in 2010. In all, Germany paid only about
one-eighth of the total.

赔款继续给德国带来极度的经济困难。1929年，美国宣布了一项新提案。杨计划将德国的赔款延长到
了五十九年的付款期限，将总额略微降低至 290 亿美元，并安排了价值数亿美元的额外贷款。德国继
续付款直到 1932 年，当时全球范围内的大萧条使其无法继续下去。后来的协议取消了更多的剩余债
务，最后一次付款终于在2010年支付。总共，德国只支付了总额的八分之一左右。


Poor decisions by Germany’s Weimar Republic contributed to growing public frustration with the
new democratic government. Many political groups attempted to use the country’s economic
problems to catapult themselves to political power. Among these was the National Socialists or Nazi
Party, whose members favored a more authoritarian government. One man who joined the group in
the early 1920s was Adolf Hitler.

德国魏玛共和国的糟糕决定导致公众对新民主政府越来越不满。许多政治团体试图利用该国的经济问
题来夺取政治权力。其中包括国家社会主义者或纳粹党，其成员赞成更专制的政府。阿道夫·希特勒是
20 年代初加入该组织的人之一.


In 1923, he decided to
launch a takeover of the state government in Munich. The planned Beer Hall Putsch (so named
because the targeted politicians were to be kidnapped at a beer hall) failed, and Hitler and many
supporters were arrested. Over the next year in jail, Hitler wrote the book Mein Kampf (“My
Struggle”), in which he outlined his plan for the Nazis to achieve political power and their goals for
the resurgence of Germany. These goals included the uniting of German-speaking peoples under
one government and an expansion eastward in search of Lebensraum or “living space.”

1923
年，他决定接管慕尼黑州政府。计划中的啤酒馆政变（之所以如此命名，是因为目标政客将在啤酒馆
被绑架）失败，希特勒和许多支持者被捕。在狱中的第二年，希特勒写下了《我的奋斗》一书，在书
中他概述了纳粹获得政治权力的计划以及他们复兴德国的目标。这些目标包括将德语民族团结在一个
政府的领导下，以及向东扩张以寻找“生存空间”。



Still reeling from World War I in the 1920s, the governments of the major powers generally supported
disarmament and limited military buildup. Many agreements reached in the 1920s reflected this commitment to goodwill among
nations. In 1921, the Washington Naval Conference opened to address the issue of the naval arms
race that had taken place before and during World War I. U.S. secretary of state Charles Evans
Hughes proposed that the three major naval powers—Britain, the United States, and Japan—each
scuttle a number of ships and restrict future construction. The Five-Power Treaty that emerged
limited the construction of warships and the size of aircraft carriers. It established ratios for warships whereby Britain and the United States could have
the same number, and for every five ships they had, Japan could have three and France and Italy
1.75 each. Britain and the United States were allowed more ships because they maintained fleets in
both the Atlantic and the Pacific to protect their colonies.

20 年代，主要大国政府仍饱受第一次世界大战的影响，普遍支持裁军和有限的军事建设。1920 年代达成的许多协议都反映了国家间对善意的承诺。 1921年，华盛顿
海军会议开幕，旨在解决二战前和二战期间发生的海军军备竞赛问题，美国国务卿查尔斯·埃文斯·休斯
提出，三大海军强国——英国、美国和日本——每一次都击沉了一些船只并限制了未来的建造。随之
而来的五国条约限制了战舰的建造和航空母舰的规模。它
规定了英国和美国可以拥有相同数量的军舰的比例，每拥有5艘军舰，日本可以拥有3艘，法国和意大
利各拥有1.75艘。英国和美国被允许拥有更多船只，因为它们在大西洋和太平洋都拥有舰队来保护它们
的殖民地。

Japan often argued that it was not treated fairly by Western powers at either the Treaty of
Versailles negotiations or the Washington Naval Conference in the 1920s.

日本经常辩称，无论是在《凡尔赛条约》谈判还是在 1920 年代的华盛顿海军会议上，它都没
有受到西方列强的公平对待。


By the late 1920s, optimism was high that the pain of war might be a thing of the past. It was in this
spirit that the Kellogg-Briand Pact was written. The pact was a negotiation between U.S. secretary
of state Frank Kellogg and Aristide Briand, the French foreign minister, renouncing war as an
instrument of national policy. Fifteen nations signed it in 1928, and another forty-seven followed over
the next years. However, there was no way to enforce it, and no repercussions for signatories that
failed to live up to its ideals. Thus, it did little to curb the aggressive military policies of many nations
during the following decade.

到 20 年代末，人们普遍乐观地认为战争的痛苦可能会成为过去(日本和苏联肯定不会这么想, 苏联还想赤化世界呢)。正是本着这种精神，制定了《凯洛
格-布里安条约》 。该协议是美国国务卿弗兰克·凯洛格和法国外交部长阿里斯蒂德·白里安之间的谈
判，放弃将战争作为国家政策的工具。 1928 年，有 15 个国家签署了该协议，接下来的几年里又有 47
个国家签署了该协议。然而，没有办法执行它，也没有对未能实现其理想的签署者产生任何影响。因
此，它在接下来的十年里几乎没有遏制许多国家的侵略性军事政策。


The same could be said of the League of Nations. Based on high ideals, the League could issue
statements, restrictions, or condemnations, but it could not compel other countries to limit their
activities. Assessing trade restrictions on a country might have some (minor) impact, but the League
had no military arm that could physically intervene in a member country’s actions. Thus, as the
1930s began, it was regularly challenged by aggressive acts across the globe that it was powerless
to influence. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931. Italy invaded Libya in 1931 and Ethiopia in 1935.
The League did protest, especially over the Ethiopian invasion, but it could do little more than
impose economic sanctions against Italy, and even these were not upheld by all countries. It was
clear the League had no real power and no country need fear it.

国际联盟也是如此。基于崇高理想，联盟可以发表声明、限制或谴责，但不能强迫其他国家限制其活
动。评估对一个国家的贸易限制可能会产生一些（较小的）影响，但联盟没有可以实际干预成员国行
动的军事力量。因此，随着 20 世纪 30 年代的开始，它经常受到全球范围内侵略行为的挑战，而它却
无力影响。日本于 1931 年入侵满洲里。意大利于 1931 年入侵利比亚，于 1935 年入侵埃塞俄比亚。
国际联盟确实提出了抗议，特别是针对埃塞俄比亚的入侵，但它除了对意大利实施经济制裁之外无能
为力，而且即使这些制裁也没有得到所有国家的支持。很明显，联盟没有实权，没有国家需要害怕
它。


Russia underwent massive political upheaval during the Bolshevik takeover in 1917. A bloody civil
war was fought for the next three years before the Bolsheviks and their leader Vladimir Lenin were
victorious. Russia was then reorganized as the Soviet Union in the early 1920s. Lenin’s early death
created an opening exploited by Joseph Stalin.

1917 年布尔什维克掌权期间，俄罗斯经历了大规模的政治动荡。在接下来的三年里，布尔什维克及其
领导人弗拉基米尔·列宁取得了胜利，爆发了一场血腥的内战。俄罗斯随后于 1920 年代初改组为苏
联。列宁的早逝为独裁者约瑟夫·斯大林创造了一个机会



After the Bolshevik seizure of the government and Russia’s hasty departure from World War I, Lenin
moved to consolidate power in Russia. Civil war raged from 1918 to 1921 between the Red Army of
the Bolsheviks and the White Army representing all the groups that opposed them, including the
Russian upper classes, forces loyal to the monarchy, and Lenin’s enemies within the Russian Social
Democrats, such as the Menshevik faction. Members of the White Army disagreed on whether they
sought an anti-Bolshevik communist government or the return of a tsarist government. The Red
Army, though smaller, had a focused goal and was better organized.

在布尔什维克夺取政府和俄罗斯仓促退出第一次世界大战后，列宁开始巩固俄罗斯的权力。 1918年至
1921年，布尔什维克的红军和代表所有反对他们的群体的白军之间爆发了内战，其中包括俄罗斯上层
阶级、忠于君主制的势力以及列宁在俄罗斯社会民主党内部的敌人，例如孟什维克派。白军成员对于
是否寻求反布尔什维克的共产主义政府或沙皇政府的回归存在分歧。红军虽然规模较小，但目标明
确，组织较好。

British, French, Japanese, and U.S. troops all invaded Russia in support of the White Army and
stayed until 1920, but they were unable to stop the Bolsheviks from seizing control. The civil war
ended in 1921 with the Bolsheviks in control. Approximately 1.5 million soldiers had died in the
fighting, but the civilian death toll was substantially higher—about eight million.

英国、法国、日本和美国军队纷纷入侵俄罗斯支持白军，并一直呆到1920年，但无法阻止布尔什维克
夺取政权。 1921 年，内战结束，布尔什维克掌权。大约有 150 万士兵在战斗中死亡，但平民死亡人数
要高得多，大约有 800 万。

During the civil war, Lenin and the Bolshevik leadership also sought to take over lands outside
Russia that had been controlled by the now-deposed tsar. Lenin approached these regions with the
goal of creating a federal state of republics governed by a soviet, an elected committee of workers’
representatives. Each republic in this new “Soviet Union” would represent an ethnicity and be
nominally independent but ultimately under the central government’s control. Many of these areas
fiercely resisted incorporation by the Bolsheviks.

内战期间，列宁和布尔什维克领导层还试图接管俄罗斯境外曾由现已废黜的沙皇控制的土地。列宁接
触这些地区的目标是建立一个由苏维埃（一个选举产生的工人代表委员会）统治的联邦共和国。这个
新“苏联”中的每个共和国都代表一个民族，名义上独立，但最终受中央政府控制。其中许多地区强烈抵
制布尔什维克的合并。





1919年，红军入侵乌克兰，遭到强大抵抗. 乌克兰和白俄罗斯都拥有一定的自治权，但必须依靠列宁政府
来指导外交政策。其他地区，如高加索地区，争议更大。1922年，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（苏联）成立。

In 1919, the Red Army invaded Ukraine and faced strong resistance. Both
Ukraine and Belarus had some autonomy but had to rely on Lenin’s government to direct foreign
policy. Other areas, like the Caucasus, proved more contentious.  In 1922, the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was established.


Lenin’s death in 1924 opened a power vacuum and a debate over the future of policy in the Soviet
Union. There were two very different paths the country could follow. Favoring one path were leaders
such as Leon Trotsky, the man responsible for making the Red Army a dependable fighting force
during the civil war. Stalin, then in
his forties, strove to keep out of these specific debates. He and Trotsky held opposing views on
communist ideology and the future of the Soviet Union.

1924 年列宁去世引发了权力真空和关于苏联政策未来的争论。该国可以走两条截然不同的道路。支持
一条道路的是托洛茨基等领导人，他在内战期间使红军成为一支可靠的战斗力量. 。当时四十多岁的斯大林竭力回避这些具体的争论。他和托洛茨基对共产主
义意识形态和苏联的未来持有相反的看法.

In 1927, Stalin expelled Trotsky from the Communist Party. In 1929, Trotsky was forced into exile. He
was assassinated by a Soviet agent in Mexico in 1940.


1927年，斯大林将托洛茨基开除出共产党。 1929年，托洛茨基被迫流亡。 1940 年，他在墨西哥被一
名苏联特工暗杀。


Stalin speeded the drive to collectivization, and local officials did what they could to comply with the
new targets for grain collection. By 1939, more than 90 percent of the peasants had been forced to
live and work on collective farms. If they resisted, they could be arrested, and many were sent to
labor camps in Siberia. While some poor peasants complied with collectivization because they had
little of their own property to lose, middle-class peasants continued to oppose it, even killing their
livestock rather than turning flocks over to the Soviet government. More than half the nation’s
livestock was lost under collectivization in the 1930s, and the numbers did not recover until the
1950s. In some areas, spring planting did not occur due to the upheaval.

斯大林加快了集体化进程，地方官员也竭尽全力完成新的粮食征收目标。到1939年，90%以上的农民
被迫在集体农场生活和工作。如果他们反抗，他们可能会被逮捕，许多人被送往西伯利亚的劳改营。
虽然一些贫苦农民因为自己的财产几乎没有什么可损失而同意集体化，但中产阶级农民仍然反对集体
化，甚至杀死他们的牲畜，而不是把羊群交给苏维埃政府。 20世纪30年代集体化导致全国一半以上的
牲畜损失，直到1950年代这一数字才恢复。在一些地区，由于动乱，春季播种没有进行。

The failures of collectivization spelled deaths for millions in the Soviet Union. Approximately two
million died resisting or in prison, and between five and ten million additional lives were lost in a
famine caused by the chaos of the process, the peasants’ choice to slaughter their livestock, and
government policies that took food from the peasants.

集体化的失败导致苏联数百万人死亡。大约有 200 万人死于抵抗或在监狱中，另外 5 至 1000 万人死
于饥荒，原因是过程的混乱、农民选择宰杀牲畜以及政府从农民手中夺走食物的政策。


The problems surrounding collectivization also led many within the Communist Party to question the
wisdom of Stalin’s decisions. In 1934, the assassination of Sergei Kirov, a high-ranking Soviet
politician, led to an investigation that uncovered what Stalin believed was a plot to kill him. Kirov’s
death, together with the unrest caused by collectivization, the anti-Soviet rhetoric of Germany’s Nazi
Party (which had taken control of Germany in 1933), and his knowledge that many Soviet politicians
did not share his vision of the USSR’s future, fed Stalin’s growing feelings of paranoia. His belief that
he was surrounded by enemies led to a reign of terror in which the Soviet secret police arrested
millions of Soviet citizens on suspicion of disloyalty. Many were sent to prison camps in Siberia
where they perished as a result of starvation and overwork. Some were executed immediately
following brief trials. Some did not even receive trials. Historians disagree about how many Soviets died as a
result of the political purges of the 1930s, but one million is a likely figure.



围绕集体化的问题也导致共产党内部许多人质疑斯大林决策的明智性。 1934 年，苏联高级政治家谢尔
盖·基洛夫 (Sergei Kirov)遇刺，引发了一项调查，揭露了斯大林认为的刺杀他的阴谋。基洛夫之死，加
上集体化引起的骚乱、德国纳粹党（1933年控制了德国）的反苏言论，以及他知道许多苏联政客并不
认同他对苏联未来的看法，助长了斯大林日益增长的偏执情绪。他相信自己被敌人包围，导致了恐怖
统治，苏联秘密警察以涉嫌不忠为由逮捕了数百万苏联公民。许多人被送往西伯利亚的战俘营，在那
里因饥饿和过度劳累而死亡。有些人在短暂审判后立即被处决。有些甚至没有接受审判。历史学家对于 1930 年代的政治清洗造成多少苏联人死亡的说法不一，但可能
有 100 万人死亡。。

Lenin had always
seen it as dangerous and a competitor to socialism, so from the early days of the Soviet Union,
religion was targeted by Communist leaders. Yet the history of Orthodox Christianity among the
Russian people was long.

列宁一直认为宗教是危险的，是社会主义的竞争对手，因此从
苏联成立初期起，宗教就成为共产党领导人的攻击目标。然而，东正教在俄罗斯人民中的历史悠久

The decade of the 1930s was marked by economic collapse around the world. The Great Depression
gripped numerous countries, causing widespread unemployment, immense poverty, and financial
collapse. There were no easy solutions for any government trying to combat the misery, and different
countries adopted different methods to alleviate the suffering of their people. The inability of
capitalist countries to fully solve their economic problems made ideologies such as communism
more attractive.  Only the
economic stimulation of the onset of World War II brought the world closer to a return of prosperity.

20 世纪 30 年代的十年以世界各地的经济崩溃为标志。大萧条席卷了许多国家，造成了广泛的失业、
巨大的贫困和金融崩溃。对于任何试图消除苦难的政府来说，都没有简单的解决办法，不同的国家采
取了不同的方法来减轻人民的苦难。资本主义国家无法完全解决其经济问题，使得共产主义等意识形
态更具吸引力。大萧条是由一场完美的问题风暴引发的，只有第二次世界大战开始的经济刺激才使世
界更接近繁荣的回归。

When the economic collapse that came to be known as the Great Depression began in the United
States in 1929, it ended the postwar boom and sent the entire world’s economy reeling. No
economic depression is caused by one element alone.

1929 年，美国开始经济崩溃，即后来的大萧条，它结束了战后的繁荣，并使整个世界经济陷入困境。
任何经济萧条都不是由某一因素单独造成的。

The lack of banking regulations meant that
if a bank went bankrupt, those who had placed their money on deposit there lost all their savings.

。缺乏银行
监管意味着，如果银行破产，那些存入银行的人就会失去所有积蓄。


With consumers both at home and
abroad unable to purchase, the twin problems of overproduction and underconsumption
ground the economy to a halt. Contributing to this financial catastrophe was the unequal distribution
of wealth. When the Depression began, the majority of American families (80 percent) had no
savings at all, so a job loss quickly led to homelessness and hunger.

，由于国内外消费者无力购买，生产过剩
和消费不足的双重问题使经济陷入停滞。造成这场金融灾难的是财富分配不均。大萧条开始时，大多
数美国家庭（80%）根本没有积蓄，因此失业很快导致无家可归和饥饿. (裸泳者，没有储蓄后援，这种人只能活在非失业期，一遇失业即完蛋)




The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was an example of the isolationist and protectionist policies
the U.S. government followed in the 1920s. An increased tariff of nearly 40 percent had already been
enacted in 1922. Smoot-Hawley raised tariff rates another 20 percent on more than twenty thousand
kinds of imported goods, supposedly to protect American farmers and industries from foreign
competition. These extreme rates caused other countries to institute their own retaliatory high tariff
rates on U.S. goods. Its businesses
were unable to recoup any of their monies by selling goods overseas. Smoot-Hawley was the
highest tariff the U.S. government has ever enacted. It helped stifle world trade, which decreased 30
percent by the early 1930s.

1930 年的《斯穆特-霍利关税法案》是美国政府在 20 年代奉行的孤立主义和保护主义政策的一个例
子。 1922 年已经实施了近 40% 的关税上调。斯穆特-霍利法案将 2000 多种进口商品的关税税率又提
高了 20%，据称是为了保护美国农民和工业免受外国竞争。这些极端税率导致其他国家对美国商品征
收报复性高关税。其企业也无法通过向海外出售商品来收回任何资金。斯穆特-霍利关税是美国政府有史以来颁布的最
高关税。它抑制了世界贸易，到 20 世纪 30 年代初，世界贸易下降了 30%。


One of the key aspects of the Great Depression was the way it encumbered foreign trade around the
globe. Worldwide gross domestic product (GDP)—the value of all the goods and services a
country produces in one year—decreased by 15 percent between 1929 and 1932. With trade
plummeting, many U.S. banks began recalling loans made to foreign businesses and countries,
which caused crises in other places.

大萧条的关键方面之一是它阻碍了全球对外贸易。 1929 年至 1932 年间，全球国内生产总值 (GDP)
——一个国家一年内生产的所有商品和服务的价值——下降了 15%。随着贸易大幅下滑，许多美国银
行开始召回向外国企业和国家提供的贷款，这使得导致其他地方出现危机。

Hunger was a significant problem,
particularly in urban areas where there was little chance of having a garden or finding other available
foodstuffs.  Homeless camps and shantytowns sprang up, but life in
such a place was precarious because city officials might force the residents to leave.


饥饿是一个严重的问题，特别是在
城市地区，那里几乎没有机会拥有花园或找到其他可用的食物。无家可归者营地和棚户区如雨后春笋般涌现，但这些地方的生
活并不稳定，因为城市官员可能会强迫居民离开



Japan moved into Manchuria in 1931, setting up the state of
Manchukuo there the following year. Seizing the region meant Japan would not have to pay for the
items it wanted, such as rice, important during a depression that had limited its exports and thus its
income from trade.

1931
年，日本迁入满洲，次年在那里建立满洲国。占领该地区意味着日本将不必支付其想要的物品的费
用，例如大米，这在经济萧条期间很重要，因为萧条限制了其出口，从而限制了其贸易收入。


Most countries went off the gold standard—a
monetary system in which the value of a currency is tied directly to the value of gold—in the early
1930s, but there was no widespread banking collapse as there was in the United States.

大多数
国家在 20 世纪 30 年代初放弃了金本位制（一种货币价值与黄金价值直接挂钩的货币体系），但没有
像美国那样出现大范围的银行业崩溃。


It was only in the late 1930s that the French economy turned around, due to an increase
in military equipment production.

直到20世纪30年代末，由于军事装
备生产的增加，法国经济才出现好转。


In the United States, new president Franklin D. Roosevelt unveiled a comprehensive reform plan in
1933. This New Deal was designed to restore faith in the banking system, create work-relief
programs to put the unemployed to work, increase the bargaining and consumer power of industrial
workers, and provide an overall enhanced quality of life. Overhauls to the banking system included
more regulations on U.S. banks and regular audit controls. The creation of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 meant that depositors could feel their money on deposit was
safe. The United States also adopted programs that already existed elsewhere. For example, the
Social Security Administration was created in 1935 to provide an old-age pension program for the
country. Germany had such a program for several decades, and Britain had already enacted many
programs as part of its welfare state that the United States was slow to adopt.

在美国，新任总统富兰克林·罗斯福于 1933 年公布了一项全面的改革计划。这项新政旨在恢复人们对
银行体系的信心，制定工作救济计划以帮助失业者就业，增强议价能力和消费能力产业工人，并提供
全面提高的生活质量。银行体系的改革包括对美国银行的更多监管和定期审计控制。 1933 年联邦存款
保险公司 (FDIC)的成立意味着储户可以感觉到他们的存款是安全的。美国还采用了其他地方已经存在
的计划。例如，社会保障管理局成立于 1935 年，旨在为国家提供养老金计划。德国实行这样的计划已
经有几十年了，英国也已经制定了许多计划作为其福利国家的一部分，而美国却迟迟没有采用。


The New Deal in a New Century

新世纪的新政

Numerous programs enacted during the New Deal era still assist people in the United
States today. Here are some examples:

新政时期制定的许多计划仍然为今天的美国人民提供帮助。以下是一些示例：

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was created in 1933 to insure
depositor monies in banks. Originally it covered $5,000 per depositor, but it now
covers $250,000 per depositor.

联邦存款保险公司 (FDIC) 成立于 1933 年，旨在为银行存款提供保险。最初它为每位储
户提供 5,000 美元的保障，但现在为每位储户提供 250,000 美元的保障。

The Social Security program was begun in 1935 to oversee Old-Age and Survivors
Insurance (OASI), unemployment insurance, and aid to families.

社会保障计划始于 1935 年，旨在监督老年和遗属保险 (OASI)、失业保险和家庭援助。

The federal minimum wage was established in 1938 as an increase over the
minimum wages in many industries, though some workers, such as domestic workers,
were left out.

联邦最低工资于 1938 年制定，提高了许多行业的最低工资，但一些工人（例如家政工
人）被排除在外。

Some of these programs are the subject of intense debate today. Projections show that
Social Security may not be able to meet all its obligations in coming decades, which could
lead to curtailing of benefits. The minimum wage originally reflected increased buying
power for workers, rather than setting the bottom threshold of pay as it does now. Many
states have mandated minimum wages above the federal government’s requirement. Some
argue that a higher minimum wage today will only increase the prices of products and
services. Others contend that the increased buying power of workers with a higher
minimum wage will stimulate the economy for all.

其中一些计划是当今激烈争论的主题。预测显示，未来几十年社会保障可能无法履行其所有
义务，这可能导致福利减少。最低工资最初反映了工人购买力的增加，而不是像现在那样设
定工资的最低门槛。许多州规定的最低工资高于联邦政府的要求。一些人认为，今天更高的
最低工资只会提高产品和服务的价格。其他人则认为，最低工资较高的工人购买力的增强将
刺激所有人的经济。


In countries with capitalist systems,
the gap between the “haves” and “have-nots” was particularly stark in the 1930s.  The appeal of
communist ideology grew among some who felt abandoned by the capitalist system, and the
prospect of economic equality was its most attractive feature. In other countries, the economic
crisis became an opportunity for increased authoritarianism.


在资本主
义制度国家，“富人”与“穷人”之间的差距在20世纪30年代尤其明显。共产主义意识形态的吸引力在一些感到被资本主义制度抛弃
的人中越来越大，而经济平等的前景是其最有吸引力的特征。在其他国家，经济危机成为威权主义抬
头的机会。(要"改变原有制度"的想法，导致有病乱投医，极端思想和幻想，都会成为无知人们的选择)

The Communist Party experienced substantial growth in many Western democracies in the early
1930s.  For some, communism offered not simply economic parity but the prospect of racial
parity as well.

20 世纪 30 年代初，共产党在许多西方民主国家经历了大幅发展. 对于一些人来说，
共产主义不仅(为他们幻想)提供了经济平等，还提供了种族平等的前景。


In France, different cabinets were formed and repeatedly reorganized, and the disordered political
realm threatened to become a vacuum that far-right politicians could exploit. In 1936, a coalition of
leftist groups known as the Popular Front managed to win power in the government. They introduced
progressive and pro-labor policies such as forty-hour workweeks and minimum wages, both
hallmarks of Western democratic responses to the Great Depression. But as other countries had
done, France found it could not resolve the Great Depression through policy changes alone.

。在法国，不同的内阁组建并反
复改组，混乱的政治领域有可能成为极右政客可以利用的真空。 1936 年，一个被称为“人民阵线”的左
翼团体联盟成功赢得了政府权力。他们推出了进步和有利于劳工的政策，例如每周工作四十小时和最
低工资，这都是西方民主应对大萧条的标志。但正如其他国家所做的那样，法国发现仅通过政策改变
无法解决大萧条。

On the pretext that certain actions were necessary for the good of the populace in this time of crisis,
some leaders took advantage of the opportunity to impose authoritarian rule. This was particularly
true in Italy, Spain, and Germany, which all embraced fascism in the 1930s. Fascism was a political
movement focused on transforming citizens into committed nationalists striving for unity and racial
purity, to remedy a perceived national decline. To forge a unified nation, fascists espoused using
violence, abandoning democratic norms and the rule of law to eliminate enemies real or imagined,
and employing totalitarianism, the total control by the government of all aspects of a person’s life.
The interwar period and the problems of the 1920s gave rise to disillusionment with democratic and
parliamentary governments worldwide.

一些领导人以在危机时刻为了民众的利益而必须采取某些行动为借口，利用这个机会实行独裁统治。
在意大利、西班牙和德国尤其如此，这些国家都在 20 世纪 30 年代拥抱了法西斯主义。法西斯主义是
一场政治运动，致力于将公民转变为坚定的民族主义者，努力争取团结和种族 纯洁，以纠正明显的国
家衰落。为了建立一个统一的国家，法西斯主义者主张使用暴力，放弃民主规范和法治来消除真实或
想象的敌人，并采用极权主义，即政府对一个人生活的各个方面进行完全控制。两次世界大战之间的
时期和 20 年代的问题引起了全世界(一些国家)对民主议会政府的幻灭。(事后证明, 是有点有病乱投医, 摸着石头过河, 有很多国家就掉坑里了, 陷入了极权主义的危害. )


In Spain, a military dictatorship was instituted in 1924. After it ended in 1930, a republic was
established that quickly sought to modernize the nation. It tried to eliminate the Catholic Church’s
dominant role in society and politics and attempted other changes such as land redistribution and
the institution of voting rights for women and more liberal divorce laws. However, a serious military
coup erupted in 1936. Fascists calling themselves Nationalists had co-opted much of the Spanish
military.


西班牙于 1924 年建立了军事独裁统治。1930 年军事独裁统治结束后，建立了共和国，并迅速实现国
家现代化。它试图消除天主教会在社会和政治中的主导地位，并尝试其他变革，例如土地重新分配和
妇女投票权制度以及更自由的离婚法。然而，1936 年爆发了一场严重的军事政变。自称为民族主义者
的法西斯分子收编了大部分西班牙军队.


The popular general Francisco Franco, former head of Spain’s military academy, was opposed to
Republican ideologies.

British, French, and other European powers pursued a policy of
nonintervention. The League of Nations also failed to take action.

受欢迎的西班牙军事学院前院长弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥将军反对共和主义意识形态。然而，英国、法国和其他欧洲大国奉
行不干涉政策. 国际联盟也没有采取行动。

Franco’s brand of fascism and his revulsion of popular democracy, liberal ideals,
secularism, feminism, and communism were similar to those of Mussolini and Hitler.

。佛朗哥的法西斯主义以及他对大众民主、自由主义理想、世俗主义、女
权主义和共产主义的厌恶与墨索里尼和希特勒相似。


The country’s political parties had forced the kaiser to abdicate in
favor of a new constitutional government, the Weimar Republic.  Many Germans therefore believed civilian politicians were responsible for their defeat in the war. In
1919, monarchists, socialists, and communists began to disrupt politics and violently contest for
control of the streets in Berlin and elsewhere.

(第一次世界大战的失败, 德国) 该国的政党迫
使德皇退位，转而建立新的宪政政府——魏玛共和国。许多德国人因此认
为文职政客应对他们在战争中的失败负责。 1919 年，君主主义者、社会主义者和共产主义者开始扰乱
政治，并激烈争夺柏林和其他地方街道的控制权。

The Nazis adopted
nineteenth-century theories of the hierarchy of races that proclaimed the Germanic Nordic or Aryan
races to be master humans.

纳粹采用了十九世纪的种族等级理论，宣称日耳曼北欧或雅利安种族是人类的主人。(把人分成三六九等, 犹如蒙元将中国分成四等人, 汉人居底层.)


The Great
Depression put as many as four million Germans out of work. Hitler
and the Nazis  claimed that Jewish bankers and business owners had caused the Great
Depression. The Nazis were becoming the largest party in the
legislature. President Paul von Hindenburg was therefore pressured to appoint Hitler chancellor in
January 1933.

大萧条导致多达 400 万德国人失业，希特勒和纳粹声称犹太银行家和企业主造成了大萧条. 纳粹正在成为立法机构中
最大的政党。因此，保罗·冯·兴登堡总统被迫于 1933 年 1 月任命希特勒为总理。

Just a month after he became chancellor, an arsonist set the
German Reichstag building in Berlin ablaze. The
crime was falsely blamed on a Dutch communist and communist instigators in general. The climate
of crisis convinced conservative members of parliament to temporarily grant Hitler emergency
powers through the Enabling Act passed in March 1933. Hitler was then able to rule essentially
without the involvement of parliament or any constitutional limitations. In 1934, he declared himself
führer (“leader”), fusing the offices of president and chancellor into one all-powerful role.

在他就任总理一个月后，一名纵火犯纵火焚烧了柏林的德国国会大厦。这一罪行被错误地归咎于荷兰共产主义者和共产主义煽动者 (每一种政治意识形态都视所有其他政治意识形态为敌人)。危机气氛
促使保守派议会成员通过 1933 年 3 月通过的《授权法案》暂时授予希特勒紧急权力。随后希特勒基本
上可以在没有议会参与或任何宪法限制的情况下进行统治。 1934 年，他宣布自己为元首（“领袖”），
将总统和总理的职位合并为一个全能的角色。

Hermann Göring  became the second most powerful Nazi leader, in charge of
organizing the national economy and commanding the German air force, the Luftwaffe. Heinrich
Himmler transformed the paramilitary militia, the Schutzstaffel (SS), from a small force of 290 to
over a million strong and was responsible for promoting German culture and institutions and
overseeing the enforcement of Nazi racial policies.

赫尔曼·戈林，成为
纳粹第二大领导人，负责组织国民经济并指挥德国空军德国空军。海因里希·希姆莱 (Heinrich Himmler)
将准军事民兵党卫队(SS)从一支 290 人的小部队发展为超过 100 万人，负责推广德国文化和制度，并
监督纳粹种族政策的执行。

The various German security and secret police agencies were combined to create the Gestapo,
which became the main dispatcher of violence and enforcer of order.

德国各个安全和秘密警察机构合并成立了盖世太保，它成为暴力的主要调度者和秩序的执行者。

The educational system was reorganized. All teachers
were required to join the Nazi Teacher’s Alliance and use prescribed Nazi textbooks in their
teaching. Outside the classroom, German children were organized into tiered levels of youth
organizations, culminating in the Hitler Youth for boys and the League of German Girls. For boys, the
focus was on militaristic training, while girls were taught racial hygiene (the perceived need to bear
children with certain traits) and the domestic skills to be good housewives and mothers.


教育系统进行了重组. 所有教师都被要求加入纳粹教师联盟，并在教学中使用规定的纳粹教科书。在课堂之
外，德国儿童被组织成不同层次的青年组织，最终形成了男孩希特勒青年团和德国女孩联盟。对于男
孩来说，重点是军国主义训练，而女孩则接受种族卫生教育（认为需要生育具有某些特征的孩子）以
及成为好家庭主妇和母亲的家政技能。

Laws were passed limiting job
opportunities and social activities for Jewish people. Hitler banned all political parties other than the Nazis, making Germany a oneparty
state. All newspapers and media were Nazi controlled.

通过了限制犹太人就业机会和社会活动的法律. 希特勒取缔了纳粹以外的所有政党，使德国成为一党制国家。所
有报纸和媒体都受到纳粹控制


The Nazis assured the electorate that they were the only ones who could solve Germany’s
economic problems and promised to restore its international prestige. Hitler set out to provide jobs
to all who needed them with a massive infrastructure program. The work week was expanded to sixty hours; workers could not strike or even ask for
raises, but unemployment declined.

纳粹向选民保证，他们是唯一能够解决德国经济问题的人，并承诺恢复其国际威望。希特勒着手通过
一项大规模的基础设施计划为所有需要的人提供就业机会。每周工作时间延长至六十小时；工人们不能罢工，甚至
不能要求加薪，但失业率却下降了。


Those not working in an industrial capacity could find a place in the ever-expanding Germany
military. Ignoring the limits imposed by the Versailles Treaty, Hitler swelled the German Army to
nearly a million soldiers, calling the need to provide employment an emergency that must be met. However, there was little international will for such intervention. It could very well mean military
engagement, and in the throes of the Depression, none of the former Allied nations were interested.
Nor was there any popular support in these nations for such actions.

那些不从事工业工作的人可以在不断扩张的德国军队中找到一席之地。希特勒无视《凡尔赛条约》的
限制，将德国军队扩充至近百万士兵，并称提供就业是必须满足的紧急需要。然而，国际社会并没有进
行此类干预的意愿。这很可能意味着军事介入，而在大萧条的阵痛中，没有一个前同盟国对此感兴
趣。这些国家的此类行动也没有得到任何民众的支持。

Through employment programs and deficit spending (spending based on borrowing money rather
than on raising money through taxation), the economic problems in Germany did begin to turn
around under Hitler’s government. The unemployment rate dropped from a high of approximately 30
percent to about 10 percent.

通过就业计划和赤字支出（基于借钱而不是通过税收筹集资金的支出），德国的经济问题在希特勒政
府的领导下确实开始得到扭转。失业率从约30%的高位下降至约10%。


It was not just Europe that underwent major changes in the interwar years. The Ottoman Empire
ceased to exist, and the region it had dominated now became a multitude of various powers, of
which Turkey retained the largest Ottoman legacy. The colonies Germany had held in Asia and
Africa were distributed among the victorious countries and came under new governments. The
rhetoric of self-determination of nations was not applied equally around the world, but its focus on
nationalist ideologies filtered through many societies, spurring the growth of nationalist movements
around the globe.

在两次世界大战期间经历重大变化的不仅仅是欧洲。奥斯曼帝国不复存在，它所统治的地区现在变成
了众多的强国，其中土耳其保留了最大的奥斯曼帝国遗产。德国在亚洲和非洲拥有的殖民地被分配给
战胜国并由新政府管辖。民族自决的言论并没有在世界各地得到平等的应用，但其对民族主义意识形
态的关注渗透到许多社会，刺激了全球民族主义运动的发展。(那个年代有创新的政治思想，能推动世界各国进步，如今的世界各国只关心经济赚钱，是不是缺乏政治上的新思想呢？)
