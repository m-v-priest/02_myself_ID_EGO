== 原住民的"万物有灵论"


For many Indigenous peoples, their religious belief systems were animistic, meaning the spiritual world resided not just in humans but also in animals, plants, and even rocks. This belief was very different from monotheism, in which all spiritual power resided in one single divine being.

对于许多原住民来说，许多宗教信仰体系, 都是"万物有灵论"的，这意味着精神世界不仅存在于人类之中，还存在于动物、植物, 甚至岩石中。这种信仰与"一神论"非常不同，"一神论"中所有的精神力量, 都存在于一个神圣的存在中。

Like humans, animals, and plants, the earth possessed sacred power; therefore, it could not be owned. The concept of owning land seemed nonsensical to many Indigenous groups, and their corresponding lack of emphasis on private property was one reason Europeans sometimes found it easy to lay claim to lands inhabited by native peoples.

和人类、动物、植物一样，大地也拥有神圣的力量。因此，它不能被拥有。对于许多原住民群体来说，"拥有土地"的概念似乎毫无意义，而他们相应地缺乏对私有财产的重视，这就是欧洲人有时发现"很容易对原住民居住的土地提出要求"的原因之一。

As the fortunes of Spain and Portugal declined in the seventeenth century, England, France, and the Netherlands claimed territory in Asia and the Americas and established their own trading posts on the African coast. Spain and Portugal also failed to acknowledge the rights of the Indigenous peoples in the lands they claimed. Indeed, many Europeans believed that by conquering the inhabitants of the Americas and giving them no choice but to convert to Christianity, they were saving their souls.



十七世纪，随着西班牙和葡萄牙的衰落，英国、法国和荷兰, 声称在亚洲和美洲拥有领土，并在非洲海岸建立了自己的贸易站。西班牙和葡萄牙也没有承认"原住民在他们声称拥有的土地上的权利"。事实上，许多欧洲人相信，通过征服美洲居民, 并让他们别无选择，只能皈依基督教，他们就可以拯救自己的灵魂。

When Columbus arrived, the Indigenous population of the entire Western Hemisphere likely numbered around seventy-five million (compared to Europe’s population of probably around seventy million), although historians’ estimates vary greatly.

当哥伦布到达时，整个西半球的土著人口数量, 可能约为七千五百万（而欧洲的人口可能约为七千万），尽管历史学家的估计差异很大。

Coffee and sugar cane, introduced to the Americas by Europeans, grew exceedingly well in the tropical climates of the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and the southernmost portions of North America. This need for labor eventually led to the plantation-style slavery that took hold in parts of the United States, islands in the Caribbean, and areas of South America such as Brazil.

咖啡和甘蔗, 由欧洲人引入美洲，并在加勒比海、中美洲、南美洲和北美洲最南端的热带气候中, 生长得非常好。这种对劳动力的需求, 最终导致了"种植园式奴隶制"的出现，这种奴隶制在美国部分地区、加勒比海岛屿, 以及巴西等南美洲地区盛行。







































Smith also argued that

史密斯还认为，





Mercantilism affected the relationship not only between countries but also between classes. For instance, it elevated the interests of merchants and manufacturers over those of workers and consumers by arguing that wages should be kept low. More money would thus remain in employers’ hands, and people would be discouraged (or prevented) from buying luxury goods that could instead be exported for profit. Mercantilists also advocated high taxes to enrich governments.

重商主义不仅影响国家之间的关系，而且影响阶级之间的关系。例如，重商主义者还主张高税收来充实政府。

The nations of Europe planted them with cash crops Europeans craved but could not produce at home. To maximize profit, they drove workers hard without regard for their health or safety. When Indigenous peoples and European servants could not satisfy their demands, they turned to enslaved labor taken from Africa.

欧洲国家在美洲殖民地, 种植了欧洲人渴望但在国内无法生产的经济作物。为了实现利润最大化，他们不顾工人的健康或安全，拼命地驱使工人。当原住民和欧洲仆人无法满足他们的需求时，他们转向从非洲掠夺的奴工。

One of the largest migrations in history took place between the late fifteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as Europeans forcefully transported approximately twelve million Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas to provide labor for Europe’s economic enterprises. Some two million people died on the voyages across the Atlantic.

历史上最大规模的移民之一发生在 15 世纪末和 19 世纪初，当时欧洲人强行将大约 1200 万非洲人跨 大西洋运送到美洲，为欧洲的经济企业提供劳动力。大约有两百万人在横渡大西洋的航行中丧生。

The majority of Africans brought across the Atlantic were destined to labor on sugar plantations in the Caribbean and Brazil. Many enslaved Africans were also sent to the Spanish colonies in South America; relatively few went to the North American mainland, mostly Mexico. European colonists had originally considered using enslaved Indigenous peoples to perform the difficult and dangerous labor of harvesting sugar cane and other cash crops, but these efforts failed. Indigenous people died in large numbers from infectious diseases, leaving too few to labor in the fields.

大多数跨越大西洋被带到的非洲人注定要在加勒比海和巴西的甘蔗种植园劳动。许多被奴役的非洲人 也被送往南美洲的西班牙殖民地；前往北美大陆的人相对较少，主要是墨西哥。欧洲殖民者最初考虑 利用被奴役的原住民来从事收割甘蔗和其他经济作物的艰巨而危险的劳动，但这些努力失败了。土著 人民因传染病大量死亡，只剩下很少的人在田里劳动。

For Europeans, the ideal laborers would be people as unfamiliar with the terrain as they were, because unlike enslaved Indigenous people who knew the best places to hide, they could more easily be recaptured if they ran away. In addition, they would be less affected by many of the infectious diseases from which Europeans suffered.

对于欧洲人来说，理想的劳工应该是不熟悉地形的人，因为与知道最佳藏身之处的被奴役土著人不 同，如果他们逃跑，他们更容易被抓回来。此外，他们将较少受到欧洲人遭受的许多传染病的影响。

European indentured servants would also have fit the bill, but the hot Caribbean climate and diseases like malaria and yellow fever, brought from Africa with cargoes of enslaved people, led to high death rates among Europeans within the first year and discouraged most others from immigrating there. Indentured servitude did not satisfy the labor needs of tobacco planters in Virginia and Maryland either.

In addition, a French law passed in 1664 that restricted planters’ right to beat their indentured servants made servants a less desirable form of labor in the eyes of French colonists. Thus, Europeans eager to extract a profit looked to Africa as the solution, choosing slavery over indentured servitude, as Africans could be enslaved for a lifetime.

欧洲的契约仆人也符合这一要求，但加勒比地区炎热的气候以及从非洲通过奴隶货物带来的疟疾和黄 热病等疾病导致欧洲人在第一年内的高死亡率，并阻止了大多数其他人移民到那里。契约奴役也不能 满足弗吉尼亚州和马里兰州烟草种植者的劳动力需求. 此外，法国1664年通过 的一项法律限制种植园主殴打契约仆人的权利，这使得仆人在法国殖民者眼中成为不太理想的劳动形 式。因此，渴望获取利润的欧洲人将非洲视为解决方案，并寻求奴隶制而不是契约奴役。，而且非洲人也可以终生受奴役，

Some captains, knowing that 10 to 20 percent would die on the voyage, packed as many people as possible into the hold.

一些船长知道 10% 到 20% 的人会在航行中丧生，因此将尽可能多的人塞进货舱

At times crews would bring the enslaved Africans onto the deck for fresh air and make them jump and dance to exercise their muscles, since buyers would not pay high prices for those who looked weak. Removing captives from the hold was always a risk for the crew, however, since this was the time when a revolt was most likely to take place.

有时，工作人员会将被奴役的非洲人带到甲板上呼吸新鲜空气，让他们跳跃和跳舞以锻炼肌肉， 因为买家不会为那些看起来很虚弱的人支付高价。然而，将俘虏从货舱中转移出来对于船员来说始终 是一个风险，因为这是最有可能发生叛乱的时间。

Taking enslaved people to the deck was also risky because many used the opportunity to commit suicide rather than endure the misery on board ship or the uncertain fate that awaited them. Some captains strung nets below the ships’ rails to catch those who jumped overboard.

将被奴役的人 带到甲板上也很危险，因为许多人利用这个机会自杀，而不是忍受船上的痛苦或等待着他们的不确定 的命运。一些船长在船栏杆下挂网来捕捉跳船的人。

Illness was the slave ship captains’ constant fear. The most feared of all diseases was trachoma, an infection of the eyes that did not kill but left its victims blind. Enslaved people who could not see would not be purchased. Even more frightening was the possibility that the infection would spread to the crew. If the sailors lost their sight, everyone on board faced a slow death from starvation.

疾病是奴隶船船长们一直担心的事情。所有疾病中最可怕的是沙眼，这是一种眼睛感染，不会致命，但会导致受害 者失明。看不见的奴隶不会被收买。更可怕的是，感染有可能传播到船员身上。如果水手们失明，船 上的每个人都将面临因饥饿而慢慢死亡的危险，

Slave voyages were often heavily insured against loss.

奴隶航行通常都会投保重险以防损失。

The captives purchased by European ship captains were sold by other Africans. Europeans did not introduce slavery to Africa; it had existed there for centuries before the triangular trade began. It was different in important ways, however, from the slavery that awaited Africans on the other side of the Atlantic.

欧洲船长购买的俘虏被其他非洲人出售。欧洲人并没有将奴隶制引入非洲；而是欧洲人将奴隶制引入 了非洲。在三角贸易开始之前，它已经在那里存在了几个世纪。然而，它在一些重要方面与大西洋彼 岸的非洲人所面临的奴隶制有所不同。

Slavery existed in numerous African societies, and there were many ways in which a person could become enslaved. In some societies, slavery served as punishment for a crime. In others, people could be enslaved or sell their children into slavery to pay a debt. In times of hardship like famine, parents might sell children to more prosperous people to earn money to support themselves and ensure their children would be fed. In many societies, enslaved people were taken as prisoners of war.

许多非洲社会都存在奴隶制，一个人可以通过多种方式成为奴隶。在某些社会，奴隶制是对犯罪的惩 罚。在其他情况下，人们可能会被奴役或将自己的孩子卖为奴隶以偿还债务。在饥荒等困难时期，父 母可能会将孩子卖给更富裕的人，以赚钱养活自己并确保孩子有饭吃。在许多社会中，奴隶被当作战 俘。

Those enslaved to pay a debt gained their freedom once the debt had been settled. Africans regarded slavery as an unfortunate fate that might befall anyone; being enslaved did not imply an inherent difference or inferiority.

那些被奴役以偿还债务的人，一旦债务得到解决， 就获得了自由.非洲人认为奴隶制是一种可能降临到任何人身上的不幸 命运。被奴役并不意味着固有的差异或自卑。

Slavery in the Americas was different. It was chattel slavery, in which one person is owned by another as a piece of property like an inanimate object. The enslaved had no status or legal rights as persons. They could be bought, sold, inherited, or given to another. They had no right to control their own bodies or their own labor, and they could be compelled to do whatever the slaveholder wished. Their status could be passed on to their children; in all the European colonies in the Americas, the child of an enslaved woman was born enslaved. Although chattel slavery also existed in Africa, this was the only form of slavery that existed in the Americas.

美洲的奴隶制则不同。这就是动产奴隶制，一个人像无生命的物体一样被另一个人拥有作为财产。被 奴役者没有作为人的地位或合法权利。它们可以被购买、出售、继承或赠予他人。他们无权控制自己 的身体或自己的劳动，他们可能被迫做奴隶主想做的任何事。他们的地位可以传给他们的孩子；在美 洲的所有欧洲殖民地，一名被奴役的妇女的孩子生下来就是奴隶。虽然非洲也存在动产奴隶制，但这 是美洲存在的唯一形式的奴隶制。

Slave traders commonly chained their captives together on the journey, and devices were sometimes fixed to captives’ necks so that if they managed to escape, they would die of thirst because they could not lower their heads into streams to drink. Once they reached the coast, the traders stripped them naked and shaved their heads to keep them free of lice. The traders then greased their bodies with palm oil to make them look fit and healthy when buyers came.

奴 隶贩子通常在旅途中将他们的俘虏锁在一起，有时还会在俘虏的脖子上固定一些装置，这样如果他们 成功逃脱，他们就会渴死，因为他们无法低头入溪喝水。当他们到达海岸时，商人们就把他们脱光衣 服，并剃光头以防止虱子。然后，商贩们在自己的身体上涂上棕榈油，以便在买家到来时让他们看起 来健美健康。

A number of slave trading ports flourished on the western coast of Africa from the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries. Among them were Ouidah (Whydah), Grand-Popo, Jaquim, and Porto-Novo in modern Benin; Badagry in Nigeria; and Little Popo in Togo.

Some African city-states and kingdoms became wealthy from the slave trade.

从十五世纪到十八世纪，非洲西海岸有许多奴隶贸易港口蓬勃发展。其中包括现代贝宁的维达 （Ouidah）、大波波（Grand-Popo） 、雅金（Jaquim ）和波多诺伏（Porto-Novo ）；尼日利亚的巴 达格里；和多哥的小波波。一些非洲城邦和王国通过奴隶贸易致富.

When slave traders captured young adults, no one remained to care for children and the elderly, and fewer people were left to reproduce. To compensate for the disappearance of so many young men, who were the laborers most preferred by plantation owners, many African ethnic groups adopted polygyny.

当奴隶贩子俘虏年轻人时，就没有人留下来照顾儿童和老人，留下来繁 衍后代的人也更少了。为了弥补种植园主最青睐的大量年轻人的消失，许多非 洲民族实行一夫多妻制

The importation of European textiles, according to some historians, spurred the industrialization of the European textile industry while harming African cloth producers, who could not compete on quantity or price. Weavers continued to produce goods for local markets, but no continent-wide market for African textiles ever had an opportunity to develop because Europeans already dominated the field. There were similar consequences for the African metal industry.

一些历史学家认为，欧洲纺织品的 进口刺激了欧洲纺织业的工业化，同时损害了非洲布料生产商的利益，因为非洲布料生产商无法在数 量或价格上进行竞争。织布工继续为当地市场生产商品，但非洲纺织品的整个大陆市场从未有过发展 的机会，因为欧洲人已经在该领域占据主导地位。非洲金属工业也遭受了类似的后果。(一步落后，步步落后，所以科技竞争绝不能落后，否则就只能从产业链低端做起，跟中国一样，付出代价，才能慢慢向上爬)

These effects have been long-lasting. One scholar has demonstrated that the areas from which the most enslaved people were taken are today the poorest in Africa.

Other studies have shown that people from ethnic groups most likely to have been subject to the slave trade are less likely to trust others than are people from less affected groups.

这些影响是持久的。一位学者证明，被奴役最多的地区如今是非洲最贫穷的地区. 其他研究表 明，与受影响较小的群体相比，最有可能遭受奴隶贸易的族群的人不太可能信任他人。(西方人对自己历史的罪恶有深刻的反省，不像中国一样，把自己的罪恶只想掩盖)

Most of the crops grown by enslaved Africans in the Americas were labor intensive.

。美洲被奴役的非洲人种植的大部分农作物都是劳动密集型的。

Sugar, the most valuable crop grown by enslaved people, also required the most labor. The labor was grueling and dangerous. Sugar cane was densely planted, and undergrowth in the fields could hide snakes that bit workers. After fertilizing and weeding the cane, workers harvested it by cutting it close to the ground with machetes and then chopping it into smaller pieces to make it easier to remove from the fields. Machetes wielded in tired workers’ sweaty hands often slashed legs and feet. Workers might bleed to death or die when wounds became infected. People who worked too slowly were beaten.

Laborers then transported the cut cane to a mill to be crushed by heavy rollers that often caught and mangled workers’ hands. This had to be done very quickly, within twenty-four hours of cutting the cane, because the sap evaporated quickly. The workers boiled the crushed cane to extract a liquid that was clarified and crystalized into sugar, a process that required hours of standing next to roaring fires where workers were often scalded. To maximize profits, planters rotated production, so while sugar cane was growing in one field, it was being harvested in another. Because sugar cane rapidly depleted nutrients in the soil, laborers frequently also had to clear land for new fields.

糖是奴隶种植的最有价值的作物，也需要最多的劳动力，。这项工作既艰苦又危险。甘蔗种植很密 集，田地里的灌木丛可能隐藏着咬伤工人的蛇。给甘蔗施肥和除草后，工人们用砍刀将其靠近地面切 割，然后将其切成小块，以便更容易从田地中移走，从而收获甘蔗。疲倦的工人出汗的手上挥舞的砍 刀经常割伤腿和脚。工人可能会失血过多而死，或者因伤口感染而死亡。工作太慢的人会被殴打。 然后，工人们将切下的甘蔗运到工厂，用重型滚筒压碎，这些滚筒经常夹住并压伤工人的手。这必须 非常快地完成，在砍断甘蔗后二十四小时内完成，因为汁液蒸发得很快。工人们将压碎的甘蔗煮沸， 提取液体，然后澄清并结晶成糖，这个过程需要在熊熊大火旁站上几个小时，工人们经常被烫伤。为 了实现利润最大化，种植者轮流生产，因此，当甘蔗在一块地里种植时，它就会在另一块地里收获。 由于甘蔗会迅速耗尽土壤中的养分，劳动者还经常不得不清理土地开垦新田。

Because infant mortality among enslaved people in the Caribbean was rampant, the enslaved population was not self-reproducing, and slaveholders had to buy more people each year to maintain their labor force. This differed substantially from the English North American mainland colonies where, because the work of growing and processing tobacco was less physically grueling, enslaved people did not die in such high numbers, and the population was able to grow through reproduction.

由于加勒比地区被奴役者的婴儿死亡率很 高，被奴役人口无法自我繁殖，奴隶主每年不得不购买更多的人口来维持劳动力。这 与英属北美大陆殖民地有很大不同，因为(北美的)种植和加工烟草的工作不那么耗费体力，被奴役的人不会死 亡如此之多，而且人口能够通过繁殖而增长。

Largely unmoved by the misery of enslaved Africans, Europeans possessed an insatiable appetite for sugar that only grew as time passed. As the demand for sugar grew, so did the demand for enslaved laborers. Between 1450 and 1600, approximately 2,500 enslaved Africans a year were purchased by Europeans; in the sixteenth century, most of these people were sent to Hispaniola, Cuba, Brazil, and Venezuela. Beginning in the seventeenth century, however, as England, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark established sugar plantations in the Caribbean, the number of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas rose to some 18,680 per year. In the eighteenth century, by which time thousands of sugar mills dotted the coast of Brazil and the Caribbean islands, 61,330 people traversed the Middle Passage each year. Forty-two percent were sent to labor in the Caribbean and 38 percent to Brazil. The British colonies of the North American mainland claimed only 4 to 5 percent of the total.

欧洲人对被奴役的非洲人的苦难基本无动于衷，他们对糖的胃口随着时间的推移而不断增长。 随着对糖的 需求的增长，对奴役劳工的需求也在增长。 1450 年至 1600 年间，欧洲人每年购买大约 2,500 名被奴 役的非洲人；十六世纪，这些人大部分被送往伊斯帕尼奥拉岛、古巴、巴西和委内瑞拉。然而，从 17 世纪开始，随着英国、法国、荷兰和丹麦在加勒比地区建立甘蔗种植园，被带到美洲的非洲奴隶数量 每年增加到约 18,680 人。 18 世纪，巴西和加勒比海岛屿沿岸遍布着数千家糖厂，每年有 61,330 人穿越中间航道。 42% 的人被送往加勒比海地区做劳工，38% 的人被送往巴西。北美大陆的 英国殖民地仅占总数的 4% 至 5%。

糖与大西洋奴隶贸易的增长。随着欧洲对糖的需求增加，巴西和加勒比海 地区对被奴役劳工的需求也随之增加，这两个地区合计约占 18 世纪之交被带到美 洲的非洲被奴役人数的 80%。

Sugar and the Growth of the Atlantic Slave Trade. As the European demand for sugar increased, so too did the demand for enslaved laborers in Brazil and the Caribbean, which together would account for approximately 80 percent of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas at the turn of the eighteenth century.

The trade in both sugar and enslaved people sustained numerous industries and employed thousands of people, creating great wealth for some. Shipbuilders, ship captains, and sailors found employment, as did dock workers, freight drivers, customs agents, and workers in sugar refineries. Bakers, pastry cooks, candy makers, and grocers all indirectly made money from sugar. People who made the barrels that held sugar and the other products produced by enslaved people—tobacco, rice, and indigo—profited, as did those who supplied inexpensive clothing, shoes, and foodstuffs like salted fish for enslaved people. Banks and insurance companies earned enormous sums as well, and those who owned large sugar plantations often invested their profits in other industries, built magnificent mansions, or bought luxury goods.

糖和奴隶贸易维持了众多工业并雇用了数千人，为一些人创造了巨大财富。造船厂、船长和水手找到 了工作，码头工人、货运司机、报关员和糖厂工人也找到了工作。面包师、糕点师、糖果制造商和杂 货商都间接地从糖中赚钱。制造装糖和奴隶生产的其他产品（烟草、大米和靛蓝）的桶的人获利了， 那些为奴隶提供廉价衣服、鞋子和咸鱼等食品的人也获利了。银行和保险公司也赚取了巨额资金，那 些拥有大型甘蔗种植园的人经常将利润投资于其他行业，建造宏伟的豪宅，或购买奢侈品。

Such wealth was easily transformed into political power. Sugar planters in Britain successfully lobbied Parliament to protect their interests, and many planters went into politics, holding seats in the House of Commons and, by using their wealth to purchase titles and estates, the House of Lords. It was thanks to the sugar lobby in Parliament that the British navy began to give its sailors a daily ration of grog, a mixture of rum, sugar, and lime juice, increasing the profits of British sugar planters even more.

这些财富很容易转化为政治权力。英国的糖料种植园主成功游说议会保护他们的利益，许多种植园主 进入政界，在下议院占据席位，并利用自己的财富购买头衔和地产，进入上议院。多亏了议会的糖业 游说团体，英国海军开始向水手们提供每日配给的烈酒，一种朗姆酒、糖和酸橙汁的混合物，进一步 增加了英国糖业种植者的利润。
