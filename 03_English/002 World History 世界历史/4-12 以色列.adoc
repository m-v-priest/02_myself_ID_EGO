== 以色列问题的由来

Ever since the nineteenth century, many European Jews had worked through Zionist organizations to encourage the return of Jews to their ancestral homeland in the Middle East.

自19世纪以来，许多欧洲犹太人一直通过"犹太复国主义组织"努力鼓励犹太人返回他们在中东的祖先家园。

The British complicated matters in another part of their mandate with the Balfour Declaration. This statement, one of many conflicting promises Britain made to various groups during the war, was issued by British foreign secretary Alfred Balfour in 1917. Balfour wrote that Britain supported a “national home” for Jewish people in Palestine. The Balfour Declaration marked the accomplishment of the goal that pro-Zionist groups had worked toward for years.

Palestine was a British mandate after the war but mainly inhabited by Arab peoples; the move to introduce a substantial number of Jewish residents (with government support) promised to cause problems, and in fact it touched off religious and property disagreements that continue to this day.

英国人通过《贝尔福宣言》使他们的另一部分任务复杂化。1917年，英国外交大臣阿尔弗雷德·巴尔福（Alfred Balfour）发表了这一声明，这是英国在(第一次世界大战)战争期间, 向各团体做出的许多相互矛盾的承诺之一。贝尔福写道，英国支持巴勒斯坦犹太人建立“民族家园”。《贝尔福宣言》标志着"亲犹太复国主义"团体多年来努力实现的目标的实现。

巴勒斯坦在战后是英国的托管地，但主要居住着阿拉伯人；（在政府的支持下）引进大量犹太居民的举动, 注定会引发问题，事实上，它引发了宗教和财产方面的分歧，一直持续到今天。

The British began by summarily making an area of Palestine available to Jewish immigrants and, between 1922 and 1935, the Jewish population as a percentage of the total population increased threefold, from 9 percent to almost 27 percent. The Palestinians immediately complained of being treated as second-class citizens in their own land and about Britain’s failed promise to grant Arabs independence.

Riots and protests became so common that Britain ultimately restricted immigration to Palestine, cutting off a route of escape for Jewish people fleeing the anti-Semitic policies of the Nazis.

英国一开始就草率地将巴勒斯坦地区, 开放给犹太移民，从 1922 年到 1935 年间，犹太人口占总人口的比例增加了三倍，从 9% 增加到近 27%。巴勒斯坦人立即抱怨在自己的土地上被视为二等公民，并抱怨英国未能承诺给予阿拉伯人独立。

骚乱和抗议变得如此普遍，以至于英国最终限制了移民到巴勒斯坦，切断了犹太人逃离”纳粹反犹太政策”的一条逃跑路线。

==  英国支持犹太人在巴勒斯坦建立国家 (1917)

British actions laid the groundwork for another conflict in the Middle East following World War II. In 1917, Britain’s foreign secretary Arthur James Balfour had declared that Britain would support the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

Throughout the 1930s, Jewish people from Europe had streamed to the region, and as their numbers increased, so did violence between them and Arabs, who demanded an end to Jewish immigration and the creation of an independent Arab state.

英国的行动, 为二战后中东的另一场冲突奠定了基础。 1917年，英国外交大臣阿瑟·詹姆斯·贝尔福宣布,  英国将支持在巴勒斯坦建立犹太人家园。

整个 20 世纪 30 年代，来自欧洲的犹太人涌入该地区，随着他们人数的增加，他们与阿拉伯人之间的暴力事件也随之增加，因为阿拉伯人要求结束犹太移民, 并建立一个独立的阿拉伯国家。

'''

==  一种反对犹太人都到以色列去的理由:

- I claim that the lives that British Jews have led, that the aims that they have had before them, that the part that they have played in our public life and our public institutions, have entitled them to be regarded, not as British Jews, but as Jewish Britons.

我声称，"英国犹太人"的生活、他们的目标、他们在我们的公共生活和公共机构中所扮演的角色，使他们有资格被视为"有犹太血统的英国人(他们就是英国人)", 而不是"英国的犹太人"(不属于英国人).

- When the Jews are told that Palestine is their national home, every country will immediately desire to get rid of its Jewish citizens.

当犹太人被告知巴勒斯坦是他们的民族家园时，每个国家都会立即希望摆脱其犹太公民.(这个理由不成立. 1.即使犹太人不建国, 其他有的国家就不会驱赶犹太人了么? 2.即使犹太人有了自己的国度, 也未必会所有国家都会因此而驱逐犹太人)

'''

==  纳粹对犹太人的压迫和限制

During these years, the Nazis were progressively implementing increasingly severe persecutions of Jewish people. First, a law enacted on April 7, 1933, banned them from positions in the civil service.

That same year, the first and longest-surviving Nazi concentration camp, Dachau, was set up near Munich, intended for political prisoners.

Several laws collectively known as the Nuremberg Laws were promulgated in 1935, institutionalizing Nazi racial theories and discrimination against Jewish people. A Jewish person was defined as anyone with three Jewish grandparents, regardless of whether they were active in the Jewish religious community or how deeply they identified as German. Jewish people were denied citizenship in the new Nazi-led German empire, called the Third Reich, and were forbidden to marry or have sexual relations with ethnic Germans, designated as “Aryans.” They lost the right to vote and most other political rights.

纳粹对犹太人的迫害:

- 禁止他们担任公务员 (1933年 法律)
- 将对犹太人的歧视, 制度化 (1935年, 纽伦堡法 )
- 剥夺犹太人的公民身份
- 剥夺犹太人的"投票权"和大多数其他政治权利。
- 禁止犹太人与“雅利安人”德国人通婚
- 建立"达豪集中营” (在慕尼黑附近)

==  水晶之夜 (1938.11)

Two days of violent attacks on them in November 1938, ignited by the assassination of a German diplomat in Paris by a Polish Jewish man, became known as Kristallnacht, the “Night of Broken Glass.” Almost every synagogue in Germany was torched during the rampage, as well as 90 percent of Jewish-owned businesses. Some thirty thousand Jewish males were taken into custody and sent to Dachau.

1938 年 11 月，一名德国驻巴黎外交官, 被一名波兰犹太人暗杀，引发了为期两天的暴力袭击，被称为“水晶之夜”。德国几乎所有的犹太教堂, 以及 90% 的犹太人拥有的企业, 都在这场暴乱中被烧毁。大约三万名犹太男性被拘留, 并送往达豪(集中营)

==  特别行动队, 处决犹太人 (1939)

Anti-Semitism had been an undercurrent in European history for centuries, and anti-Jewish propaganda and scapegoating began to surface after Germany’s defeat in World War I.

几个世纪以来，反犹太主义一直是欧洲 历史上的暗流，德国在第一次世界大战中战败后，反犹太宣传和替罪羊开始浮出水面。

When the Wehrmacht streamed into Poland in 1939 and encountered the largest Jewish population in the world, the Nazis had the opportunity to begin the genocide known as the Holocaust on a huge scale. Special execution squads called the Einsatzgruppen (“operational groups”) followed the advancing German troops, killing enemies and undesirables—largely Jewish people.

Jewish people were gathered in ghettoes for better control and subjected to forced labor. The largest was the Warsaw ghetto, which by 1941 housed 441,000 people. That same year, six major concentration camps were established, and railroad lines were built specifically to transport prisoners to them.

There had been anti-Jewish pogroms (massacres) in Poland before the war, and some Polish citizens joined these German extermination activities.

1939 年，当国防军涌入波兰并遭遇世界上最多的犹太人口时，纳粹有机会开始大规模的种族灭绝，即大屠杀。被称为"特别行动小组"（ Einsatzgruppen ）的特别处决小队, 跟随前进的德国军队，杀死敌人和不受欢迎的人——主要是犹太人。

犹太人被聚集在贫民区, 以获得更好的控制, 并遭受强迫劳动。最大的是"华沙犹太区"，到 1941 年已有 441,000 人居住。同年，建立了六个主要集中营，并修建了专门将囚犯运送到集中营的铁路线。

战前波兰曾发生过反犹大屠杀（屠杀），部分波兰公民也加入了德国的这些灭绝活动中。

'''

==  二战前德国纳粹迫害犹太人时, 世界其他国家对犹太人的接纳状况

Kristallnacht caused a severe deterioration in Germany’s international standing. Across Europe, many Jewish people became refugees as they fled the oppressive politics of the Nazis.

"水晶之夜"事件导致德国的国际地位严重恶化。在整个欧洲，许多犹太人因逃离纳粹的压迫政治而成为难民。

'''

===  英国的接纳

In Britain, an outraged public pressured Parliament into allowing unaccompanied Jewish children under seventeen to take refuge in England. During the nine months before the war, this Kindertransport may have rescued as many as ten thousand children.

在英国，愤怒的公众向议会施压，要求允许十七岁以下无人陪伴的犹太儿童在英国避难。在战前的九个月里，这个"儿童运输"行动可能已经拯救了多达一万名儿童。

'''

===  法国的行动

A thirty-two-nation international conference was held in France during the summer of 1938 to solve the Jewish refugee crisis, but no country stepped forward to accept any such immigrants.

1938年夏天，法国召开了一次三十二国国际会议来解决犹太难民危机，但没有一个国家站出来接受此类移民。

'''

===  美国的接纳

In February 1939, a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress to allow ten thousand Jewish children to enter the country in 1939 and another ten thousand in 1940. Though popular, the bill failed due to lukewarm political support.

1939 年 2 月，美国国会提出一 项法案，允许 1939 年允许 1 万名犹太儿童进入美国，并在 1940 年再允许 1 万名犹太儿童进入美国。 该法案虽然很受欢迎，但由于政治支持冷淡而失败。

'''

===  中国上海的接纳

In Asia, Shanghai was an option for Jewish refugees looking for a new home. The city, along with Franco’s Spain, was unconditionally open to Jewish migration. Nominally still a German ally in 1939, the Nationalist government in the southwestern corner of China formulated a plan to provide a haven for European Jewish refugees. It had multiple reasons for doing so, including attracting international Jewish support and gaining favor with Britain and the United States against Japan.

A number of schemes were hatched, both by members of the GMD government and by private individuals, one even gaining the support of scientist Albert Einstein. GMD diplomats in Europe like Feng Shan Ho, consul general in Vienna, issued visas to Jewish refugees seeking to relocate to Shanghai. A Jewish community of more than twenty thousand displaced persons had reached the city by the end of the war.

在亚洲，上海是犹太难民寻找新家的一个选择。这座城市与佛朗哥统治下的西班牙一样，无条件地向犹太人移民开放。 1939 年，中国西南角的国民党政府, 虽然名义上仍是德国盟友，但制定了一项为欧洲犹太难民提供避难所的计划。它这样做有多种原因，包括吸引国际犹太人的支持, 以及赢得英国和美国的青睐来对抗日本。

国民党政府成员和私人, 策划了一系列计划，其中一项计划甚至得到了科学家阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦的支持。国民党驻欧洲外交官，如驻维也纳总领事"何凤山"，向寻求移居上海的犹太难民发放了签证。战争结束时，由两万多名流离失所者组成的犹太社区, 已抵达该市。

==  以色列建国 (1948.5.14)

Following the end of World War II, as Jewish survivors of the Holocaust sought refuge in Palestine, the British government requested that the United Nations resolve the issue. In 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine visited the region and recommended that it be divided into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The city of Jerusalem, sacred to both groups, was to be placed under an “international trusteeship.” In November 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted the committee’s suggestion with the passage of Resolution 181.

第二次世界大战结束后，大屠杀后的犹太幸存者, 前往巴勒斯坦寻求庇护，英国政府请求联合国解决这一问题。 1947年，联合国"巴勒斯坦特别委员会"访问该地区，建议将其分为"犹太国家"和"阿拉伯国家"。对这两个群体来说, 都是神圣的"耶路撒冷"将被置于“国际托管”之下。 1947年11月，联合国大会采纳了委员会的建议，并通过了第181号决议。

UN Partition Plan for Palestine. The UN’s 1947 plan to partition Palestine divided it into Jewish and Arab sectors. Jewish people would control most of the coast and the southern part of the country. The Arab sectors were divided from one another by large areas of Jewish settlement.

联合国"巴勒斯坦分治计划"。联合国 1947 年的巴勒斯坦分治计划, 将其分为"犹太人区"和"阿拉伯区"。犹太人将控制该国的大部分海岸和南部地区。阿拉伯地区则被大片"犹太人定居点"分开。

About 250,000 Palestinian Arabs fled Jewish-controlled areas. On May 14, 1948, as the last British forces left the region, David Ben- Gurion, the leader of the Jewish settlement in Palestine, announced the founding of the nation of Israel.

Both the United States and the Soviet Union officially recognized the new state. Israel’s Arab neighbors did not, and they proclaimed that Arabs within Israel had a right to self-determination.

大约 25 万巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人, 逃离犹太人控制的地区。 1948 年 5 月 14 日，当最后一支英国军队离开该地区时，巴勒斯坦"犹太人定居点"的领导人大卫·本·古里安, 宣布"以色列"建国.

美国和苏联都正式承认这个新国家。以色列的阿拉伯邻国, 却没有这样做，他们宣称以色列境内的阿拉伯人拥有自决权。

'''

==  第一次以阿战争 (即第一次中东战争) (1948. 5.15)

On the evening of May 14, an air attack on the Israeli city of Tel-Aviv began, and the next day forces from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Transjordan (now called Jordan) invaded the country. The First Arab-Israeli War lasted ten months, with Israel emerging victorious in March 1949. Not only had it defended its existence, but it had also gained control of much of the territory the 1947 UN committee had recommended reserving for Arab settlement. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs left Palestine—now part of Israel—for neighboring countries.

5月14日晚，对以色列城市"特拉维夫"的空袭开始，第二天来自埃及、叙利亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和"外约旦"（现称约旦）的军队入侵该国。"第一次阿拉伯-以色列战争"持续了 10 个月，以色 列于 1949 年 3 月取得胜利。它不仅捍卫了自己的存在，而且还控制了 1947 年联合国委员会建议保留用于"阿拉伯定居点"的大部分领土。数十万阿拉伯人离开巴勒斯坦（现在是以色列的一部分）前往邻国。

==  苏伊士运河危机 (即第二次中东战争, 1956)

As well as weakening British power in the Middle East, Nasser, who became prime minister of Egypt in 1954, wished to make his country the leader of the Arab world, a position also sought by Iraq.

1954 年出任埃及总理的纳赛尔, 除了削弱英国在中东的实力外，还希望让自己的国家成为阿拉伯世界的领导者，伊拉克也在寻求这一地位。

On July 26, 1956, Nasser, who had been elected president of Egypt the month before, nationalized the Suez Canal and immediately closed it to Israeli shipping. On October 29, Israel invaded Egypt, and on November 5, Britain and France did as well, touching off the Suez Crisis.

The United Nations passed a resolution calling for a cease-fire, and both the United States and the Soviet Union demanded an immediate end to the invasion. All three withdrew, but Israel did so with the guarantee that it would be allowed to use the Straits of Tiran to send shipping through the canal. A UN peacekeeping force was left in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula to guard the border with Israel.

1956 年 7 月 26 日，一个月前当选埃及总统的纳赛尔, 将"苏伊士运河"收归国有，并立即禁止以色列航运。 10月29日，以色列入侵埃及，11月5日，英法也入侵埃及，引发苏伊士运河危机。

联合国通过决议要求停火，美国和苏联都要求立即停止入侵。这三个国家(英,法,以色列)都撤出了，但以色列在撤出时, 得到了允许其使用"蒂朗海峡"通过运河运送船只的保证. 联合国维和部队驻扎在埃及"西奈半岛"，守卫与以色列的边境。

The withdrawal of Israel and the Western powers from Egypt augmented Nasser’s status as selfproclaimed leader of the Arab world and brought him closer to forging the pan-Arab state he desired.

以色列和西方列强从埃及撤军, 增强了"纳赛尔"自称为阿拉伯世界领袖的地位，并使他更接近建立他所渴望的泛阿拉伯国家。

'''

==  六日战争 (第三次中东战争, 1967.06.05 - 05.11)

Although relative peace had returned to the region following the end of the Suez Crisis, also called the Second Arab-Israeli War, Palestinian guerrillas continued to strike at Israel from bases in Egypt and Syria.

尽管"苏伊士运河危机"（也称为第二次"阿以战争"）结束后, 该地区恢复了相对和平，但巴勒斯坦游击队, 继续从埃及和叙利亚的基地袭击以色列。

In April 1967, following air battles between Israeli and Syrian pilots, Egypt, under the false belief that Israel was preparing to invade Syria, removed the UN peacekeeping force from the Sinai Peninsula and amassed troops there. On May 22, Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, which Israel considered an act of war.

On June 5, Israel began the Third Arab-Israeli War by launching a preemptive strike on Egypt. Attempted attacks by Jordan and Syria were fended off, and Israel seized territory from these nations as well as from Egypt. The fighting ended nearly as soon as it had begun, earning the conflict the title of the Six-Day War.

Israel had gained control of the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank (of the Jordan River) from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria, greatly enhancing the size of its territory.

1967年4月，以色列和叙利亚飞行员发生空战后，埃及错误地认为以色列准备入侵叙利亚，将"联合国维和部队"撤出西奈半岛，并在那里集结部队。 5月22日，埃及对以色列航运关闭了"蒂朗海峡"，以色列认为这是一种战争行为。

6月5日，以色列对埃及发动先发制人的打击, 从而引发了"第三次阿以战争。约旦和叙利亚企图发动的袭击被击退，以色列从这些国家以及埃及手中, 夺取了领土。战斗几乎一"开始就结束了，这场冲突被称为“六日战争” 。

以色列从埃及那控制了"西奈半岛"和"加沙地带"，从约旦那控制了"约旦河西岸"，从叙利亚那控制了"戈兰高地"，领土面积大大扩大。

'''

==  赎罪日战争 (第四次中东战争, 1973.10. 06日 -26日)

On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria, which sought the return of the Golan Heights, launched a surprise attack on Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish religious calendar, when many Israeli soldiers were off duty. Once again, Israel was victorious. Israel had not lost any of the conquered territory, and in subsequent years Sadat was forced to engage in more peaceful efforts to seek the return of Egyptian lands.

1973年10月6日，寻求夺回"戈兰高"地的埃及和叙利亚, 在犹太教历中最神圣的赎罪日, 对以色列发动突然袭击，当时许多以色列士兵都在下班。以色列再次取得了胜利。以色列没有失去任何被征服的领土，在随后的几年里，(当时的埃及总统)萨达特被迫采取更加和平的努力，来寻求埃及土地的归还。
