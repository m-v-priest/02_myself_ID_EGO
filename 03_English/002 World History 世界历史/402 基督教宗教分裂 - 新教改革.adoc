'''

In the same year as Columbus’s momentous voyage, Spain defeated the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula and expelled Jewish people from the land. Challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church were brewing, however, and the passage of less than a century found Europeans hopelessly divided over matters of faith as the result of an event known as the Protestant Reformation.

哥伦布伟大航海的同一年，西班牙击败了伊比利亚半岛最后一个穆斯林据点，并将犹太人驱逐出这片土地。然而，对天主教会权威的挑战, 也正在酝酿之中. 不到一个世纪的时间，欧洲人因"新教改革"事件, 而在信仰问题上出现无可救药的分裂。

'''

== "新教改革"出现的背景原因

=== 教会的腐败

The Protestant Reformation began in 1517, but its seeds had been sown years earlier. Over the course of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church had grown richer, and its higher clerical offices had become dominated by people motivated more by the desire for wealth and power than by spiritual concerns. Although Europe’s peasants remained devoutly attached to their faith, critics claimed that

- popes acted less like Christ’s representatives on earth and more like secular princes, intervening in European political affairs and even commanding armies.
- Members of the clergy often lived lavishly in palatial surroundings and dressed themselves in silks and furs.
- Some had mistresses and illegitimate children, who were often given positions in the church.
- Wealthy families often purchased church offices for their members,
- and some men held bishoprics (areas under the authority of a bishop) in more than one place at a time by hiring other men to perform their offices.

Secular rulers, kings, and princes jealous of the church’s power sometimes vied with the pope for control of the churches in their territory and welcomed opportunities to reject the church’s authority.

新教改革始于 1517 年，但其种子早在几年前就已播下。在中世纪的过程中，天主教会变得更加富有， 其高级教职职位, 已被更多出于"对财富和权力的渴望, 而不是精神关注"的人所主导。尽管欧洲农民仍然虔诚地信仰他们的信仰，但批评者声称:

- 教皇的行为不太像基督在地球上的代表，而更像世俗王子, 他们干预欧洲政治事务，甚至指挥军队。
- 神职人员经常生活在富丽堂皇的环境中，穿着丝绸和毛皮衣服。
- 有些人有情妇和私生子，他们经常在教会中担任职务。
- 富裕的家庭经, 常为其成员购买教堂办公室，
- 一些男子通过雇用其他男子履行职责，同时在多个地方拥有主教职位（主教管辖的地区）。

嫉妒教会权力的世俗统治者、国王和王子, 有时会与教皇争夺对其领土内教会的控制权，并欢迎"能拒绝教会权威"的任何机会。

=== 出现"赎罪券"的理由

Indulgences were a way to reduce or even cancel the time after death during which people needed to suffer in purgatory to atone for their sins before reaching heaven. These rewards could be earned by performing actions of great religious merit, such as going on Crusade. However, the church also taught that the pope controlled a store of merit amassed by Jesus and the Christian saints, whose virtue was so great they had entered heaven with grace left over. The church could allot this “extra” virtue to someone else in the form of an indulgence.

赎罪券是一种减少甚至取消死后时间的方法，在这段时间里，人们在进入天堂之前, 需要在炼狱中受苦以赎罪。这些奖励, 可以通过执行具有重大宗教价值的行为来获得，例如参加十字军东征。然而，教会还教导说，教皇控制着耶稣和基督教圣徒积累的功德，他们的美德如此之大，以至于他们带着剩余的恩典进入了天堂。教会可以以"赎罪券"的形式将这种 “额外”的美德分配给其他人。

=== (路德) 对"赎罪券"的批判, 论证

A German monk named Martin Luther began the Protestant Reformation. Luther was outraged at the selling of indulgences. He drafted ninety-five arguments explaining why the sale of indulgences was wrong.

一位名叫"马丁·路德"的德国僧侣, 开启了"新教改革"。路德对教廷出售"赎罪券"感到愤怒。他起草了九十五条论据, 来解释为什么出售"赎罪券"是错误的.

论证逻辑:

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |

|-> 有信仰就能超生, 而不在于行动 (*即"全由上帝决定,非人力可改变,命定论"*)
|- He believed only God could grant forgiveness and that humans could do nothing to ensure their salvation, which depended entirely upon God. This is known as the doctrine of justification by faith.

他(马丁·路德)相信只有上帝才能给予宽恕，凡人无法采取任何措施, 来确保他们的救赎，这完全取决于上帝。这被称为"因信称义"的教义。

The Catholic Church taught that salvation was achieved through a combination of religious faith and good works. Buying an indulgence was regarded as a good work because the money went to the church. Luther taught that faith alone was sufficient for salvation and that humans were unable to work toward their own redemption, which depended entirely upon God.

天主教会教导说，"救赎"是通过"宗教信仰"和"善行"的结合, 来实现的。"购买赎罪券"被认为是一件"善行"，因为钱都捐给了教堂。而路德教导说，只要有"信仰", 就足以获得救赎，而人类无法为自己得到救赎, 而做努力，这完全取决于上帝的意志。(*这其实剥夺了"人的主观能动性", 宣扬了"命定论".*)

|-> 圣经是唯一的指导内容, 而非后人添加的其他习俗
|- Luther also said the pope had no control over purgatory and that there was no foundation in the Bible for the belief that the merit amassed by Jesus and the saints could be given to others.

路德还表示，教皇无法控制"炼狱"，圣经中没有任何基础可以相信"耶稣和圣徒所积累的功德, 可以给予他人"。

- Furthermore, adherence to centuries’ worth of Catholic tradition was not necessary to be a good Christian. Luther contended that scripture alone should be the source of Christian belief and practice. His followers thus abandoned many traditional Catholic practices, including clerical celibacy.

此外，遵守几个世纪来的天主教传统, 并非是成为一名优秀基督徒的必要条件。路德认为，圣经本身, 就应该是基督教信仰和实践的(真正)源泉。因此，他的追随者放弃了许多"传统的天主教习俗"，包括神职人员的"独身"习惯。新教徒还呼吁废除"僧侣和修女的宗教秩序"。

|-> 人能否赎罪,不取决于"赎罪券"
|- Any truly repentant Christian has a right to full remission of penalty and guilt, even without indulgence letters.

任何真正悔改的基督徒, 都有权完全免除刑罚和罪责，即使没有赎罪券。

|-> "买赎罪券"不是真正的"善行"
|- Christians are to be taught that he who gives to the poor or lends to the needy does a better deed than he who buys indulgences.

Christians are to be taught that the pope would and should wish to give of his own money, even though he had to sell the basilica of St. Peter, to many of those from whom certain hawkers of indulgences cajole money.

基督徒应该被教导，施舍给穷人, 或借钱给有需要的人, 这些善行, 能比购买"赎罪券"的人, 做得更好。 +
基督徒应该被教导，教皇愿意, 而且应该愿意, 将自己的钱捐给众多那些被"赎罪券小贩"骗取金钱的人，即使他不得不卖掉圣彼得大教堂。

|->
|- Protestants also called for the abolition of religious orders of monks and nuns. A life in the clergy, which the Catholic Church had proclaimed the greatest of all callings, was considered no better than the pursuit of any other vocation in life.

天主教会宣称, 神职人员是所有职业中最伟大的. 但人们并不认为, "神职人员"比"生活中其他职业"更好。

|===


In 1521, he was excommunicated (excluded from participating in the life of the church).

1521年，他(路德)被逐出教会（被排除在教会生活之外）。

Efforts to silence Martin Luther were unsuccessful, and the new form of Christianity called Protestantism spread throughout the German-speaking lands. Often the new religion was welcomed by rulers as a reason to reject the pope’s authority.

压制马丁·路德的努力没有成功，新教的基督教形式, 在整个德语区传播开来。通常，"新教"受到统治者的欢迎，能利用它作为武器, 来"拒绝教皇权威".

The printing press with movable type, developed in Europe during the Renaissance, aided Martin Luther in his efforts to spread his message.

文艺复兴时期, 在欧洲发展起来的活字印刷机, 也帮助了马丁·路德来传播他的信息.


'''

=== (加尔文) 的观点 -> 命定论


Another center of Protestant thought was the city of Geneva in what is now Switzerland. The city’s religious leader, John Calvin, espoused a doctrine known as predestination, which held that God had predetermined which souls would be granted salvation upon death and which were destined for hell. No person could ever know for certain whether they were saved or damned, and there was nothing they could do to ensure salvation. Calvinists embraced the doctrine, despite denying human agency.

新教思想的另一个中心, 是日内瓦，位于现在的瑞士。该市的宗教领袖约翰·加尔文(John Calvin ) 他的思想与马丁·路德的思想相似，但在一个关键方面有所不同。加尔文拥护一种被称为"预定论"的学说，该学说认为上帝已经预先确定了哪些灵魂将在死亡后获得救赎，哪些灵魂注定要下地狱。没有人能够确切地知道自己是得救了, 还是被诅咒了，而且他们也无法采取任何措施, 来确保得救(命定论)。它否认了人类的"能动性".

=== 路德 & 加尔文 理论的区别

== "新教改革"的结果

=== 出现了"新教"

His intent in the Ninety-five Theses was to spark a discussion within the church that would lead to reform.

(路德) 他提出九十五条论纲的目的, 是在教会内部引发一场讨论，从而导致改革。

The version of Christianity that developed from Luther’s ideas, and that formed the basis for what became the Protestant faith, differed from the official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church in important ways.

从路德的思想发展而来的基督教版本，构成了"新教"信仰的基础，在许多重要方面不同于罗马天主教会的"官方教义"。

'''

=== 作为自救(反腐), 天主教的自我改革

The Catholic Reformation, also called the Counter-Reformation, was the Catholic Church’s effort to address Luther’s challenges as well as to effect other necessary reforms.

- Indulgences were retained, but their sale was forbidden.
- The council prohibited church officials from appointing relatives to church offices,
- limited bishops to holding office in only one bishopric,
- and took steps to improve the education of Catholic clergy and curb their luxurious habits.

天主教的宗教改革，也称为"反宗教改革"，是天主教会为解决路德的挑战, 以及实施其他必要的改革, 而做出的努力。

- 赎罪券被保留，但禁止出售。
- 该委员会禁止教会官员任命亲属担任教会职务，
- 限制主教只能在一个主教区担任职务，
- 并采取措施改善天主教神职人员的教育, 并遏制他们的奢侈习惯。

'''

== 英国 (国教: 圣公会)

=== 国王利用"新教",来实现私人的目的: 换老婆

The English Reformation, however, was of a different character. In England, reform was initially imposed from the top down, not by a committed convert but by a king looking for an expedient way to exchange one queen for another.

然而，英国决定执行宗教改革, 却具有不同的性质原因。在英格兰，改革最初是"自上而下"实施的，而非由坚定的皈依者(自下而上)实施的，只是作为国王寻求的一种权宜之计，来将自己的一位皇后, 换成另一位。

Henry VIII of England decided to remove himself from under the pope’s authority. Henry declared the English church no longer bound by the pope’s authority. In 1534, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, establishing the Church of England with the English monarch as its head.

英国的亨利八世决定摆脱教皇的权威。亨利宣布"英国教会"不再受"教皇权威"的约束。 1534年，议会通过了《至高无上法案》 ，建立了"以英国君主为首脑"的英国国教。

Under Henry’s leadership, the Church of England (also known as the Anglican Church) remained largely Catholic in terms of both doctrine and ritual, but his failure to purge the English Church of all elements of Roman Catholicism did not sit well with many Protestants.


在亨利的领导下，英格兰教会（也称为"英国国教"或"圣公会"）在教义和仪式方面, 基本上仍然保持了天主教的特点，但他未能将"英格兰教会"中的所有"罗马天主教元素"清除，这让许多"新教徒"感到不满。

- Parliament’s 1558 Act of Supremacy once again declared the Church of England separate from the Roman Catholic Church.

1558年议会的至高无上法案再次宣布英格兰教会与罗马天主教会分离。

'''

=== 英国"清教徒"(加尔文派), 去往北美, 建立自己的理想宗教"山巅之城"


- During Elizabeth’s reign, English Calvinists, known as Puritans, attempted unsuccessfully to move the Church of England even further from the doctrine and ritual of the Catholic Church.

在伊丽莎白统治期间，被称为"清教徒"的英国"加尔文主义者", 试图使英国国教进一步远离天主教会的教义和仪式，但没有成功。

- By the 1570s and 1580s, Puritans had also come to oppose the structure of the Church of England, in which the monarch was the head of the church. They believed churches should be independent and governed by groups of elected elders instead of a king or queen. Elizabeth was unwilling to change the manner in which the Church of England was governed, however.

到了1570年代和1580年代，清教徒也开始反对英国国教的结构，即"君主是教会的领袖"。他们认为, 教会应该独立，并由选举产生的长老团体, 而不是国王或王后来管理。然而，伊丽莎白不愿意改变英国国教的治理方式。


- During the reign of her successor James I, Puritans who wished to separate from the Church of England (known as Separatists) began to depart England for places, including mainland Europe and North America, where they believed they would be able to establish ideal Christian communities.

在她的继任者詹姆斯一世统治期间，希望脱离英国国教的清教徒 （称为分离主义者）, 开始离开英国, 前往欧洲大陆和北美等地，他们相信, 在那里能够建立理想的基督教社区。



'''


== 法国 (国教: 天主教)

The transition from Catholicism to Protestantism in England was more peaceful than elsewhere. Outside England, the dispute over whether a kingdom should be Catholic or Protestant could be quite violent.

在英国，从天主教到新教的过渡比其他地方更加和平。而在英格兰以外，关于"国王应该信奉天主教, 还是新教"的争论, 可能会相当激烈。

France officially issued the Edict of Nantes in 1598. The edict established Catholicism as the official religion of France.

法国于1598年颁布"南特敕令", 确立"天主教为法国国教".




'''

== 西班牙 (国教: 天主教)


In the Spanish Netherlands, Philip II of Spain fought against Calvinist rebels. The seven northern provinces established their independence from Spain as the United Provinces of the Netherlands. The Netherlands was not the only place in which Philip II, who regarded himself and Spain as defenders of Catholicism, fought to maintain the church’s supremacy. In 1588, he launched a naval attack on England with the intent of restoring it to the Catholic Church and ending its support for Protestant rebels in the Spanish Netherlands. The invasion failed.

在西属尼德兰，西班牙国王腓力二世与加尔文派叛军作战。北部七省从西班牙独立出来，成为荷兰联合省。菲利普二世认为自己和西班牙都是天主教的捍卫者，他为"维护教会的至高无上地位"而战斗的地方, 也不止荷兰一个地方。1588年，他发动了对英格兰的海上攻击，意图恢复天主教会，并结束对西属尼德兰新教叛军的支持。入侵失败了。

'''

== 德国

The wars of religion continued into the seventeenth century. From 1618 to 1648, the Thirty Years’ War between Catholic and Protestant states raged in the Holy Roman Empire. As German Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists fought one another, other European countries entered the fray.

In the end, the German Protestants were victorious. The Peace of Westphalia, which ended the war in 1648, established the independence of each of the entities, numbering nearly one thousand, that had made up the Holy Roman Empire.

宗教战争一直持续到十七世纪。 1618年至1648年，神圣罗马帝国"天主教"国家, 与"新教"国家之间的三十年战争爆发。当德国境内的天主教徒、和(新教的)"路德"教徒和"加尔文"教徒, 互相争斗时，其他欧洲国家也加入了战斗。 +
最终，德国的新教徒一方取得了胜利. 1648 年结束战争的《威斯特伐利亚和约》, 确立了组成神圣罗马帝国的近千个实体的独立性。
