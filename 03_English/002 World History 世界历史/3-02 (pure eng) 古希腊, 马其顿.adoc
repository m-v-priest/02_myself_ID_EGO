== Ancient Greece 古希腊

This era, from 800 to 500 BCE, is called Archaic Greece after arche, Greek for "beginning."


'''

=== 城邦, 大希腊

As the population expanded during the Archaic period, a shortage of farmland brought dramatic changes. Many Greeks in search of land to farm left their homes and founded colonies. The largest number were on the island of Sicily and in southern Italy, the region the Greeks referred to as Magna Graecia or “Greater Greece.” When Greeks established a colony, it became an independent polis with its own laws.

===  希波战争的原因 → 希腊城邦反抗波斯统治

The Persian Wars (492–449 BCE) were a struggle between the Greek city-states and the expanding Persian Empire.

In the mid-sixth century BCE, during the reign of Cyrus the Great, Persian armies subdued the Greek city-states of Ionia. The resident Greeks were unhappy with the tyrants’ rule, and in 499 BCE they rose in the Ionian Rebellion, joined by Athens and the Greek cities on the island of Cyprus. The Persian king Darius decided that Athens must be punished.

===  伯罗奔尼撒战争 (前431年) 的原因 → (斯巴达)伯罗奔尼撒联盟, 和(雅典)提洛联盟 之间的冲突.

The rivalry between the two city-states eventually led them into open conflict. Thus, in 431 BCE, the Peloponnesian War began. In 421 BCE, after ten years of war, the Spartans and Athenians agreed to the Peace of Nicias.

===  希腊化时期（公元前 323-31 年）

The Classical period in Greece ended when Greece lost its freedom to the Kingdom of Macedon and Macedon’s king Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire. The period that followed Alexander’s death is known as the Hellenistic period (323–31 BCE).

When he died, Alexander had made no arrangements for a successor. Alexander’s empire was divided among his top generals. During this time, the resulting mixture of cultures was neither Greek nor non-Greek but “Greek-like,” or Hellenistic, a term that refers to the flourishing and expansion of Greek language and culture throughout the Mediterranean and Near East during this period.



Some city-states in Greece organized federal leagues to maintain their independence from Macedon.
