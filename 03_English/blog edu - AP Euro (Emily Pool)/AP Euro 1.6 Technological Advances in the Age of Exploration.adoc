Hey students, it's Emily Pool. Let's talk about the Age of Exploration 探索时代.
 + 
 
Say it with me now: "In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue." But why was he able to do that? Well, because of advances 进步；进展 in navigational 导航的 technology that the Europeans had gotten from the rest of the world.
 + 
 
Things like the compass 指南针 and the lateen sail 三角帆船 from Asia, quadrant 象限仪 and the astrolabe 星盘 from the Islamic world, allowed these Europeans to set sail 启航 west across the Atlantic 大西洋.
 + 
 
Students, don't be confused 困惑的 here. Columbus wanted to specifically 特别地 get involved in 参与 Indian Ocean trade 印度洋贸易. He didn't want to go through the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国 because they were taxing 征税 people, and he wanted to avoid 避免 that tax.
 + 
 
So after many years of trying to convince 说服 many monarchs 君主 that he knew what he was doing, he sets west across the Atlantic Ocean thinking that he's going to land in India, but ends up 最终；结果 landing in the Caribbean 加勒比海. Boy, was that a lucky mistake!
 + 
 
Because this New World 新大陆 was the Europeans' for the taking 任人夺取. These Europeans, with their guns, germs 病菌, and steel 钢铁, were able to decimate 大批杀死 and subjugate 征服 indigenous 土著的 American populations 人口 and establish 建立 their own colonies 殖民地.
 + 
 
While Britain, Spain, and France get extremely 极其地 involved in the Americas, the Dutch and the Portuguese get incredibly 难以置信地 involved in the eastern Indian Ocean region 东印度洋地区. These European powers 强国 want access to 获得；接近 gold and spices 香料 and luxury goods 奢侈品 because it supports 维持 their wealth 财富 and therefore 因此 power.
 + 
 
And this is where mercantilism 重商主义 emerges as 作为……出现 an economic policy 经济政策. Countries want to export 出口 more than they import 进口 because that's going to give them a favorable balance of trade 贸易顺差. If you have colonies 殖民地 that you can extract 提取 all of those resources from, process 加工 through them back in your own country, and then sell them back to the colonies, that's giving you a pretty favorable balance of trade.
 + 
 
So while these European colonizers 殖民者 were motivated 激发；促使 -- yes -- by gold and glory 荣耀, they were also motivated by God. Specifically, Jesuit Catholic missionaries 耶稣会天主教传教士 were very active in settling 定居 the Americas.
 + 
 
Christianity 基督教 became this stimulus 刺激；促进因素 for exploration -- to bring people to the one true faith 唯一真正的信仰 -- but then also became a means of 一种……的手段 subjugating local native populations.
 + 
 
Students, I got to talk here about one of my most favorite friars 修士, Bartolomé de las Casas. He came over to the Caribbean, ended up owning indigenous peoples, but then witnessed 目睹 their brutal 残忍的 mistreatment 虐待 by the Spanish and wrote an essay -- a seminal 有重大影响的 essay -- called "In Defense of the Indians" in 1548.
 + 
 
He spent so much time fighting for 为……而斗争 the better treatment of the indigenous peoples in the Americas and wrote so many letters to Habsburg leader 哈布斯堡王朝领袖 Charles I that Charles I ended up passing the New Laws 新法律 in 1542.
 + 
 
And these laws -- again by Charles I, the head of the Habsburg family, so therefore the head of the Spanish colonies in the Americas -- said, "You know what? Yeah, we're doing this wrong." These laws were intended to 旨在 prevent the exploitation 剥削 and mistreatment of indigenous peoples in the Americas.
 + 
 
And while they were partially 部分地 followed -- because, you know, the colonists 殖民者 were upset about that -- they did result in 导致 the liberation 解放 of thousands of indigenous enslaved peoples 被奴役的土著人民.
 + 
 
Big Bartolomé de las Casas fan because it shows that you can in fact 事实上 have a redemption story 救赎故事.
 + 
 
I hope this helped. And as always, you can do it. I believe in you.

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·普尔（Emily Pool）。咱们来聊聊大航海时代（the Age of Exploration）吧。 +

现在跟我一起说：“1492年，哥伦布在蓝色的海洋上航行。” 但他为什么能够做到这一点呢？嗯，这是因为欧洲人从世界其他地方获得了航海技术（navigational technology）的进步成果。 +

像来自亚洲的指南针（compass）和三角帆（lateen sail），来自伊斯兰世界的象限仪（quadrant）和星盘（astrolabe）这类东西，使得这些欧洲人能够向西航行，穿越大西洋（Atlantic）。 +

同学们，在这里可别搞混了。*哥伦布特别想要参与到印度洋（Indian Ocean）贸易当中。他不想经过奥斯曼帝国（Ottoman Empire），因为他们会对过往的人征税，而他想要避开那笔税。* +

所以，在花了很多年时间向许多君主证明他知道自己在做什么之后，他向西穿越大西洋出发了，**心里想着自己会在印度（India）登陆，但最终却在加勒比海（Caribbean）登陆了。**好家伙，那可真是个幸运的错误啊！ +

因为**这个新大陆（New World）任由欧洲人占领。**这些欧洲人凭借他们的枪炮、病菌和钢铁，能够大量屠杀并**征服美洲的原住民（indigenous American populations），并建立起他们自己的殖民地（colonies）。** +

*当英国（Britain）、西班牙（Spain）和法国（France）深度涉足美洲（the Americas）的时候，荷兰（the Dutch）和葡萄牙（the Portuguese）则深度涉足了印度洋东部地区。这些欧洲列强想要获取黄金、香料和奢侈品，因为这能增加他们的财富，进而增强他们的权力。* +

**而这就是"重商主义"（mercantilism）作为一种经济政策出现的背景。各国都希望出口多于进口，**因为这会给他们带来有利的贸易平衡。**如果你拥有殖民地，你可以从那里开采所有的资源，在自己的国家进行加工，然后再把产品卖回给殖民地，**这就能给你带来相当有利的贸易平衡。 +

所以，*这些欧洲殖民者确实是受到了黄金和荣耀的驱使，但他们也受到了上帝的驱使。具体来说，天主教耶稣会（Jesuit Catholic）的传教士们, 在美洲的殖民活动中非常活跃。* +

基督教（Christianity）成为了推动大航海的一个因素——为了让人们信仰唯一真正的宗教——但同时也成为了征服当地原住民的一种手段。 +

同学们，我得在这里讲讲我最喜欢的修士之一，巴托洛梅·德拉斯·卡萨斯（Bartolomé de las Casas）。他来到了加勒比海地区，最终拥有了一些原住民，但后来他目睹了西班牙人对他们的残酷虐待，于是在1548年写了一篇具有开创性的文章，名为《为印第安人辩护》（“In Defense of the Indians”）。 +

他花了大量时间为改善美洲原住民的待遇而斗争，并且给哈布斯堡王朝（Habsburg）的统治者查理一世（Charles I）写了很多信，最终查理一世在1542年通过了《新法律》（the New Laws）。 +

这些法律——再说一次，是由哈布斯堡家族的首领查理一世颁布的，因此也是由美洲西班牙殖民地的首领颁布的——规定：“知道吗？没错，我们之前做得不对。” 这些法律旨在防止对美洲原住民的剥削和虐待。 +

虽然这些法律只是部分得到了遵守——因为，你懂的，殖民者对此感到不满——但它们确实让成千上万被奴役的原住民获得了解放。 +

我是巴托洛梅·德拉斯·卡萨斯的超级粉丝，因为这表明事实上你是可以有一个自我救赎的故事的。 +

我希望这能对你们有所帮助。一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Because this New World was the Europeans' for the taking. These Europeans, with their guns, germs, and steel, were able to decimate and subjugate indigenous American populations and establish their own colonies.

While Britain, Spain, and France get extremely involved in the Americas, the Dutch and the Portuguese get incredibly involved in the eastern Indian Ocean region. These European powers want access to gold and spices and luxury goods because it supports their wealth and therefore power.

And this is where mercantilism emerges as an economic policy. Countries want to export more than they import because that's going to give them a favorable balance of trade. If you have colonies that you can extract all of those resources from, process through them back in your own country, and then sell them back to the colonies, that's giving you a pretty favorable balance of trade.

So while these European colonizers were motivated -- yes -- by gold and glory, they were also motivated by God. Specifically, Jesuit Catholic missionaries were very active in settling the Americas.

Christianity became this stimulus for exploration -- to bring people to the one true faith -- but then also became a means of subjugating local native populations.

Students, I got to talk here about one of my most favorite friars, Bartolomé de las Casas. He came over to the Caribbean, ended up owning indigenous peoples, but then witnessed their brutal mistreatment by the Spanish and wrote an essay -- a seminal essay -- called "In Defense of the Indians" in 1548.

And while they were partially followed -- because, you know, the colonists were upset about that -- they did result in the liberation of thousands of indigenous enslaved peoples.

Big Bartolomé de las Casas fan because it shows that you can in fact have a redemption story.

I hope this helped. And as always, you can do it. I believe in you.
