Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about the commercial revolution 商业革命.
 + 
 
These European states have colonies 殖民地 now around the world. In order to maintain 维持 their power over their colonies and also just organize the amount of money that they have coming in, there are new innovations 创新 in banking and finance 金融.
 + 
 
My favorite to talk about is double-entry bookkeeping 复式记账法 because it just makes so much obvious sense in my 2024 brain. Double-entry bookkeeping -- you have two ledgers 分类账 where you write down what you sold and how much you sold it for. Radical 全新的；激进的 concept 概念.
 + 
 
You also have the development of joint stock companies 股份公司 like the Dutch East India Company 荷兰东印度公司 -- which is the wealthiest company in all of history, counting Amazon -- and the British East India Company 英国东印度公司.
 + 
 
You break down 分解 the term 术语 joint stock company -- that explains how it works. You have a bunch of 一群 people buying stocks 股票 in a company so that if it does well, all of the people reap 获得 the dividends 股息 of profit 利润, and if it doesn't do well, all of the people share in 分担 the loss 损失 rather than 而不是 it falling on one person.
 + 
 
New urban financial centers 城市金融中心 are growing as well, right? The cities that control trade coming back into Europe are then going to be very profitable 盈利的 places. Like Amsterdam in the Netherlands and London in England become these new financial hubs 金融中心.
 + 
 
But that deals with kind of like the emerging 新兴的 new financial elites 精英 in society. What about the average European?
 + 
 
The majority of Europeans at this time are still deriving 获得 their livelihood 生计 from agriculture 农业. And while plantation labor 种植园劳动 exists in the Americas, subsistence agriculture 自给农业 exists in Europe.
 + 
 
Europeans are still relying on 依赖 two- or three-field crop rotations 两圃制或三圃制作物轮作 in order to make sure that they have enough food for their family. But as wealthy Europeans are gaining more money because of their profitable business ventures 商业投资, they start to buy up 买下 communal common land 公共土地 in what is known as the enclosure acts 圈地法案.
 + 
 
Prior to 在……之前 the enclosure acts, you have this gigantic 巨大的 field that everyone in your cute little village could share for their livestock 牲畜, could share for their agriculture. Wealthy elites start to buy up land and literally enclose 圈起 the land -- so I'm saying putting fences 围栏 around the land -- in order to say that everything that's produced within this specific fenced area now belongs to me.
 + 
 
Farmers could still work on that land that is now owned by someone else, but then would have to give part of their proceeds 收益 and profits to that land owner. But those who didn't want to or couldn't had to move to cities. So we see the beginnings of urbanization 城市化 as well.
 + 
 
And it's in the 1500s that European population finally reaches its pre-Black Plague levels 黑死病前的水平. Increased population size leads to increased population pressure 人口压力, especially in cities who now have to regulate 管理 morality 道德 and deal with things like increased crime 犯罪 and poverty 贫困.
 + 
 
So let me summarize 总结 everything that I've said so far. There's an emerging new social hierarchy 社会等级制度 in Western Europe. You have monarchs 君主, people who control trade, and then kind of your average basic European.
 + 
 
In Eastern Europe, that is not necessarily the case. In Eastern Europe, that social hierarchy is still determined by landed aristocracy 土地贵族. So while there's this emerging middle class 中产阶级 of wealthy new trading elites in Western Europe, in the East that's not the case. It's just the people who have had power and land for a long time.
 + 
 
While they are moving toward commercial agriculture 商业农业 in the West, in the East serfdom 农奴制 is still codified 编成法典. The average European in the bottom rung 最底层 of that social hierarchy -- life is not always great. There are economic pressures 经济压力 and there are environmental pressures 环境压力 like the Little Ice Age 小冰河期.
 + 
 
How do people respond to this? They delay 推迟 marriage and also childbearing 生育. Having fewer mouths to feed makes your life maybe a little bit easier because then you can at least provide for 供养 yourself and your partner.
 + 
 
Over time, that actually ultimately 最终 does improve working conditions for families as the population evens out 趋于稳定.
 + 
 
Overall, Europe is shifting toward 转向 a money-based economy 货币经济 with new innovations in banking and finance -- which is great for people who are involved in 参与 or controlling trade.
 + 
 
The average European -- you know -- they are still living their subsistence agriculture life. Maybe some of them are starting to move to cities, but they're delaying childbearing in order to make sure that they have enough money for themselves and their small family.
 + 
 
I hope that helped. And as always, you can do it. I believe in you.

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P（Emily P）。咱们来聊聊"商业革命"（the commercial revolution）吧。 +

**这些欧洲国家如今在世界各地都拥有殖民地。**为了维持对殖民地的控制权，同时也为了管理好流入的资金，*#在银行和金融领域出现了一些新的创新举措。#* +

我最喜欢聊的是"复式记账法"（double-entry bookkeeping），因为以我2024年的思维来看，这方法简直太有道理了。复式记账法——你有两个账本，在上面记录你卖出的东西,以及卖出的价格。这概念很新颖。 +

同时也出现了像荷兰东印度公司（Dutch East India Company，这可是有史以来最富有的公司，包括亚马逊（Amazon）在内）和英国东印度公司（British East India Company）这样的股份制公司（joint stock company）。 +

你把** “股份制公司”** 这个词拆分一下，就能明白它的运作方式了。有一群人购买一家公司的股票，这样如果公司经营得好，所有人都能分得利润红利；*如果公司经营不善，所有人共同承担损失，而不是由一个人来承担。* +

新的城市金融中心, 也在不断发展壮大，对吧？**那些控制着流入欧洲贸易的城市, 将会成为利润丰厚的地方。**比如荷兰（the Netherlands）的阿姆斯特丹（Amsterdam）, 和英国（England）的伦敦（London）就成为了这些新的金融中心。 +

但这说的是社会中新兴的金融精英阶层。那普通的欧洲人呢？ +

*在这个时期，大多数欧洲人仍然靠农业为生。当美洲存在种植园劳动力时，欧洲则存在自给农业（subsistence agriculture）。* +

欧洲人仍然依靠两圃制或三圃制的轮作方式，以确保他们的家庭有足够的食物。但是，*随着富有的欧洲人因为他们有利可图的商业活动, 而获得了更多的钱，他们开始依据所谓的《圈地法案》（enclosure acts）, 购买公共土地。* +

**在《圈地法案》出台之前，有一大片土地，**你们可爱小**村庄里的每个人都可以用来放牧牲畜，也可以用来从事农业生产。#富有的精英们开始购买土地，并且实实在在地把土地圈起来#**——我是说在土地周围围上栅栏——*#然后宣称这片特定围栏区域内生产的所有东西, 现在都属于他们。#* +

*农民们仍然可以在这片现在属于别人的土地上劳作，但之后必须把他们的部分收益和利润, 交给土地所有者。但那些不想或者不能这样做的人就不得不搬到城市去。所以我们也看到了城市化（urbanization）的开端。* +

在16世纪，欧洲人口终于达到了黑死病（Black Plague）之前的水平。人口数量的增加, 导致了人口压力的增大，尤其是在城市里，城市现在不得不规范道德行为，处理诸如犯罪率上升和贫困加剧等问题。 +

那让我总结一下我到目前为止所说的一切。*在西欧（Western Europe）出现了一种新兴的社会等级制度。有君主，有控制贸易的人(新兴资产阶级)，然后就是普通的欧洲民众。* +

在东欧（Eastern Europe），情况不一定是这样。在东欧，社会等级仍然由拥有土地的贵族阶层决定。所以，**当西欧出现了新兴的富裕商业精英中产阶级时，东欧并非如此。**在东欧，掌权和拥有土地的还是那些长期以来就拥有这些的人。 +

*当西欧正朝着商业农业（commercial agriculture）发展时，东欧的农奴制度（serfdom）仍然被写进法律*。处于社会等级最底层的普通欧洲人——生活并不总是美好。存在着经济压力，也存在着像小冰期（Little Ice Age）这样的环境压力。 +

人们对此是如何应对的呢？他们推迟结婚和生育。少一张嘴吃饭可能会让你的生活稍微轻松一点，因为这样你至少可以养活自己和你的伴侣。 +

随着时间的推移，实际上当人口数量趋于平稳时，这最终确实改善了家庭的工作条件。 +

*#总体而言，欧洲正朝着以货币为基础的经济(资本主义)转变，在银行和金融领域有了新的创新#*——这对参与或控制贸易的人来说是件好事。 +

而普通的欧洲人——你知道的——他们仍然过着自给农业的生活。也许他们中的一些人开始搬到城市去，但他们为了确保自己和小家庭有足够的钱而推迟生育。 +

我希望这能对你有所帮助。一如既往，你能做到的。我相信你。 +

These European states have colonies now around the world. In order to maintain their power over their colonies and also just organize the amount of money that they have coming in, there are new innovations in banking and finance.

My favorite to talk about is double-entry bookkeeping because it just makes so much obvious sense in my 2024 brain. Double-entry bookkeeping -- you have two ledgers where you write down what you sold and how much you sold it for. Radical concept.

You also have the development of joint stock companies like the Dutch East India Company -- which is the wealthiest company in all of history, counting Amazon -- and the British East India Company.

New urban financial centers are growing as well, right? The cities that control trade coming back into Europe are then going to be very profitable places. Like Amsterdam in the Netherlands and London in England become these new financial hubs.

But that deals with kind of like the emerging new financial elites in society. What about the average European?

The majority of Europeans at this time are still deriving their livelihood from agriculture. And while plantation labor exists in the Americas, subsistence agriculture exists in Europe.

Europeans are still relying on two- or three-field crop rotations in order to make sure that they have enough food for their family. But as wealthy Europeans are gaining more money because of their profitable business ventures, they start to buy up communal common land in what is known as the enclosure acts.

Prior to the enclosure acts, you have this gigantic field that everyone in your cute little village could share for their livestock, could share for their agriculture. Wealthy elites start to buy up land and literally enclose the land -- so I'm saying putting fences around the land -- in order to say that everything that's produced within this specific fenced area now belongs to me.

And it's in the 1500s that European population finally reaches its pre-Black Plague levels. Increased population size leads to increased population pressure, especially in cities who now have to regulate morality and deal with things like increased crime and poverty.

So let me summarize everything that I've said so far. There's an emerging new social hierarchy in Western Europe. You have monarchs, people who control trade, and then kind of your average basic European.

In Eastern Europe, that is not necessarily the case. In Eastern Europe, that social hierarchy is still determined by landed aristocracy. So while there's this emerging middle class of wealthy new trading elites in Western Europe, in the East that's not the case. It's just the people who have had power and land for a long time.

While they are moving toward commercial agriculture in the West, in the East serfdom is still codified. The average European in the bottom rung of that social hierarchy -- life is not always great. There are economic pressures and there are environmental pressures like the Little Ice Age.

How do people respond to this? They delay marriage and also childbearing. Having fewer mouths to feed makes your life maybe a little bit easier because then you can at least provide for yourself and your partner.

Over time, that actually ultimately does improve working conditions for families as the population evens out.

Overall, Europe is shifting toward a money-based economy with new innovations in banking and finance -- which is great for people who are involved in or controlling trade.

The average European -- you know -- they are still living their subsistence agriculture life. Maybe some of them are starting to move to cities, but they're delaying childbearing in order to make sure that they have enough money for themselves and their small family.

I hope that helped. And as always, you can do it. I believe in you.
