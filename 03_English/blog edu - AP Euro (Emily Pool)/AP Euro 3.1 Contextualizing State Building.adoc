Hi students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about unit three: absolutism 专制主义 and constitutionalism 立宪主义. +

We are always going to start out with contextualization 情境化；背景化, and as we progress 进展；发展；推进 from unit to unit, what that means is that you need to remember what was going on in Europe in the last unit or in this case the last time period -- which is our first time period in AP Euro, 1450 to 1648. +

So what I want you to do right now is pause 暂停 this video and think back to units 1 and two, and think about why 1648 was the ending marker 标志；标识 date for those first two units. +

Okay, so what I hope you remember is that there are some political 政治的 and religious 宗教的 changes that are plaguing 困扰；折磨 Europe during our first two units of study. So the thing that ends our first time period of study is the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约 in 1648, and students, that is something that you need to know for the AP test. +

Also, if you want to know the things that you need to know for the AP test and be familiar with 熟悉 the key moments 关键时刻 over our first two units of study, check out 查看；浏览 my Ultimate Review Packet because I have step by step 逐步的；循序渐进的 timeline 时间轴 for you. +

Back to contextualization: the idea of a universal 普遍的；全体的 Christendom 基督教世界 was over in Europe. With the Peace of Westphalia, we have a lot of people competing for 争夺；竞争 political power 政治权力 under the guise of 在…的幌子下；以…为借口 religion or also just because they're getting wealthy 富有的 and they want power. +

And the Peace of Westphalia granted 授予；同意 national self-determination 民族自决 for states, which means that they can decide for themselves what religion they want to practice within their lands.

This, coupled with 与…相结合；连同 the fact that local governments 地方政府 are forced to 被迫 regulate 管理；控制；规范 their own laws, leads to new secular 世俗的；非宗教的 political institutions 政治机构 across the continent 大陆.

== 中文释义

嗨，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。咱们来聊聊第三单元：专制主义（absolutism）和立宪主义（constitutionalism）。 +

**我们总是要先介绍时代背景，**而且随着我们从一个单元学到另一个单元，这意味着你们需要记住上一单元欧洲发生了什么，或者在这种情况下，*记住AP欧洲历史课程第一个时间段（1450年到1648年）欧洲发生的事情。* +

所以我现在希望你们暂停这个视频，回想一下第一单元和第二单元的内容，*思考一下为什么1648年是前两个单元的结束标志日期。* +

好的，所以我希望你们记住，**在我们前两个单元研究的时间段里，欧洲正遭受一些政治和宗教变革的困扰。所以结束我们第一个研究时间段的事件是1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia），**同学们，这是你们参加AP考试需要知道的内容。 +

另外，如果你想知道参加AP考试需要了解的内容，并且熟悉我们前两个单元学习的关键时刻，查看我的终极复习资料包，因为我为你们准备了详细的时间线。 +

*回到##时代背景：欧洲"普世基督教世界"的理念已经结束。随着《威斯特伐利亚和约》的签订，很多人以宗教为幌子,来争夺政治权力，或者仅仅是因为他们变得富有并且想要权力。##* +

*#《威斯特伐利亚和约》赋予各国"民族自决权"，这意味着他们可以自行决定在自己的领土上信仰什么宗教。这引出了"国家主权"（national sovereignty）的概念——或者说，一个国家可以决定为自己做想做的事情。#* +

**##这一点，再加上地方政府"被迫制定自己的法律"这一事实，导致了整个欧洲出现了新的世俗政治机构。##君主们, 将与贵族或新兴的商人精英争夺权力，**而这些新兴商人精英, 正与传统权力来源竞争。 +

在这个单元里，*与地方政府制定法律, 以及人们决定自己信仰什么宗教的理念, #相伴的是，欧洲开始形成"民族认同感"#。* +

最后，#*在欧洲经历了一个多世纪的宗教冲突之后，两种新的政治制度出现了："专制主义"和"非专制主义"。后者以"立宪主义"或"共和国"的形式存在，就像我们将看到的荷兰（Dutch）的情况。*# +

新的政治制度出现的原因是有道理的。**#所有的权力来源, 都受到了这些欧洲人的挑战 (没有什么天生的理所当然. 未经审视的生活,是不值得过的)，#**而且这种情况还会继续发生，尤其是在我们为启蒙运动（Enlightenment）铺平道路的时候。 +

但是，在所有这些冲突之后，**一些人会支持一个"君主拥有所有权力"的观点，以防止类似的冲突再次发生。**同样在所有这些冲突之后，**其他地方的人会说：“实际上，让我们为'代议制政府'铺平道路吧，**因为人民的需求和愿望应该得到尊重。” +

我喜欢第三单元，因为我可以谈论我最喜欢的发展之一：英国内战（English Civil War）。所以，同学们，让我们直接进入正题吧。跟上进度，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hi students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about unit three: absolutism and constitutionalism.

We are always going to start out with contextualization, and as we progress from unit to unit, what that means is that you need to remember what was going on in Europe in the last unit or in this case the last time period -- which is our first time period in AP Euro, 1450 to 1648.

So what I want you to do right now is pause this video and think back to units 1 and two, and think about why 1648 was the ending marker date for those first two units.

Okay, so what I hope you remember is that there are some political and religious changes that are plaguing Europe during our first two units of study. So the thing that ends our first time period of study is the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and students, that is something that you need to know for the AP test.

Also, if you want to know the things that you need to know for the AP test and be familiar with the key moments over our first two units of study, check out my Ultimate Review Packet because I have step by step timeline for you.

Back to contextualization: the idea of a universal Christendom was over in Europe. With the Peace of Westphalia, we have a lot of people competing for political power under the guise of religion or also just because they're getting wealthy and they want power.

And the Peace of Westphalia granted national self-determination for states, which means that they can decide for themselves what religion they want to practice within their lands. This leads to the idea of national sovereignty -- or, you know, a nation can decide that they can do what they want to do for themselves.

This, coupled with the fact that local governments are forced to regulate their own laws, leads to new secular political institutions across the continent. Monarchs are going to be vying for power with nobility or new merchant elites that are competing with that traditional source of power.

Still in this unit, and concomitant with the idea of local governments dictating laws and people deciding what religion they want to follow, is the idea that national identities are actually starting to form in Europe.

And finally, after over a century of religious conflict in Europe, two new political systems emerge: absolutism and not absolutism. That last one can exist in the form of constitutionalism or a republic, as we will see with the Dutch.

It makes sense as to why new political systems were emerging. All of the sources of power have been challenged by these Europeans, and that is going to continue to happen, especially as we pave the way for the Enlightenment.

But in the wake of all of this conflict, some people will support the idea of one monarch having all of the power in order to prevent anything like that from happening again. And also in the wake of all of this conflict, other places will say, "Actually, let's kind of pave the way for our representative government because the people's needs and wants should be respected."

I love unit 3 because I get to talk about one of my favorite developments: the English Civil War. So let's get right into it, students. Follow along, and as always, you can do it. I believe in you.
