==== AP Euro Topic 7.2 The Dreyfus Affair (Topic 7.2 extension) 德雷福斯事件（7.2节扩展内容）
Alfred Dreyfus 阿尔弗雷德·德雷福斯 was a French Jewish man 法国犹太裔男子 who's accused of 被指控 selling military secrets 军事机密 to the German government. He's convicted 定罪 and is sent to a prison in French Guiana 法属圭亚那. But spoiler alert 剧透警告 -- he didn't do it. +

This leads to 导致 so much anti-Semitism 反犹主义 in France. Influential political figures 有影响力的政治人物 like Drumont 德鲁蒙 are going to start advocating 主张 that to be French is to be Catholic 天主教徒. So religious tensions 宗教紧张局势, religious conflicts 宗教冲突, anti-Semitism 反犹主义. +

Mass media 大众媒体 gets super involved in all of this. The affair 事件 is also where Émile Zola 埃米尔·左拉 writes "J'accuse" 《我控诉》. +

The trial 审判 first happened in 1894, but by 1906, a new government had rolled up on the scene 出现 and actually pardoned 赦免 Dreyfus. After all of this -- you know, he spent over 10 years in prison for something he didn't do, for falsified evidence 伪造的证据 because he was Jewish. +

Major effects of the Dreyfus Affair 德雷福斯事件: greater liberalization 更大程度的自由化 in France, a reduction in the power of the military 军队权力的削弱, and more separation of church and state 政教分离. And this increases Zionism 犹太复国主义 -- this desire for a Jewish homeland 犹太家园 across Europe. +

I also forgot to mention this last video, but Austria-Hungary creates a dual monarchy 二元君主国, which is not going to be a problem for anyone ever. +

==== AP Euro Topic 7.3 - part I - National Unification and Diplomatic Tensions (the Crimean War) 国家统一与外交紧张局势（第一部分 - 克里米亚战争）
We're in 1815 when Metternich created his Congress of Vienna 维也纳会议 to try to restore 恢复 this balance of power 权力平衡 in Europe. Europe seems to not remember that either in the 1800s. +

Let's talk about the Crimean War 克里米亚战争. TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read 长话短说): Russia wants to get involved in 介入 Turkey, and that threatens 威胁 a lot of these European powers 欧洲列强 in Eastern Europe. And then Britain and France get involved because of course they do. +

Austria is threatened by Russia's extending into 扩张到 the Balkan area 巴尔干地区. Austria doesn't actually get involved in this war, which leads to 导致 some problems later. +

The war plays out 发生 here on the Crimean Peninsula 克里米亚半岛. Britain, France, and Turkey take on 对抗 Russia. The year-long siege 长达一年的围攻 on the city of Sevastopol 塞瓦斯托波尔. Alfred Lord Tennyson 阿尔弗雷德·丁尼生 writes "The Charge of the Light Brigade" 《轻骑兵的冲锋》 as a response specifically to the siege. +

Hey, but shout out to 向…致敬 Florence Nightingale 弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔 because she did amazing things regarding health situations 健康状况 during the Crimean War. Clean linens 干净的床单 -- who would have thought that that would be important? +

Loss of the Crimean War allows Alexander the Second to push for 推动 the reforms 改革 that he did. Because Austria didn't engage in 参与 it, Austria is now alienated from 与…疏远 Russia and Prussia 普鲁士. This leads to 导致 German and Italian unification 德国和意大利的统一. +

==== AP Euro Topic 7.3, part II - National Unification and Diplomatic Tensions (Germany and Italy) 国家统一与外交紧张局势（第二部分 - 德国和意大利）
Two heaviness in four days -- no sweat 四天内讲两个重点，小菜一碟. +

The Crimean War 克里米亚战争 leads to 导致 the breakdown of 打破 the Concert of Europe 欧洲协调, which leads to 导致 the unification of 统一 Italy and Germany. Let's talk about those. +

Italy hadn't been united ever in its history before this. People you need to associate 记住的人物: Cavour 加富尔 is the brains 智囊 -- aka 也就是 the mastermind 策划者. Mazzini 马志尼 is the heart 核心人物 -- he led Young Italy 青年意大利党 prior to 在…之前 this unification. And Garibaldi 加里波第 and his Red Shirts 红衫军 are the sword 利剑. +

Franco-Prussian War 普法战争 also plays into 对…有影响 the unification of Italy. +

So let's talk about Germany now. Otto von Bismarck 奥托·冯·俾斯麦 -- it was all about military 军事, diplomacy 外交, and leadership 领导能力. And also like "blood and iron" “铁血政策”. +

You need to be able to associate 联系 the Franco-Prussian War 普法战争 with Bismarck because he instigated 挑起 essentially 实质上 a war with France through some falsified information 伪造的信息, and then they win. +

Realpolitik 现实政治 is something that he and Cavour both utilized 运用. I mean, practical politics 实用政治 -- not necessarily based on morality 道德 or ideology 意识形态, but pragmatism 实用主义. Bring this back to 追溯到 Machiavelli 马基雅维利 -- it's the ends justify the means 为达目的不择手段. +

His balance of powers 权力平衡 through alliance systems 联盟体系 that intended to 旨在 isolate 孤立 France. +

==== AP Euro Topic Topics 7.3-7.5 - Nationalism, Darwinism, and Scientific and Intellectual Development 民族主义、达尔文主义以及科学与知识发展
A great LEQ (Long Essay Question 长篇论文题) essay could be comparing Bismarck and Napoleon, which you should just practice right now. But let's move on. +

Bismarck was dismissed 被免职 in 1890, and that leads to 导致 an increase in tensions 紧张局势 across Europe -- which I don't know, culminates in 最终导致 World War One 第一次世界大战 or something. +

Especially when you consider that there are problems in that Balkan Peninsula 巴尔干半岛, and that leads to 导致 conflict 冲突 -- like World War One and assassinations 暗杀. +

Great. Outside of that, Charles Darwin 查尔斯·达尔文 proposes 提出 this idea of evolution 进化论. Herbert Spencer 赫伯特·斯宾塞 says, "Hey, you know what? The survival of the fittest 适者生存 idea -- what if it pertains to 适用于 human society?" +

This leads to 导致 a justification of 为…提供合理性 racist theories 种族主义理论 that we call Social Darwinism 社会达尔文主义, which then leads to 导致 new imperialism 新帝国主义. +

Remember gold, glory, and god. It's the same thing kind of. This time, gold is in the form of resources 资源, glory is in the form of nationalism 民族主义, and god is specifically related to Protestant missionaries 新教传教士. +

Thanks, Industrial Revolution 工业革命, for new inventions 新发明 like the steamship 汽船, the telegraph 电报, the Minié ball 米尼弹, and guns 枪支. +

==== AP Euro Topics 7.6 The Age of Progress and Modernity 进步与现代性时代
Imperialism 帝国主义 is my favorite topic but also least favorite topic for obvious reasons. Anti-Social Studies has like everything that you need to know about imperialism, so if you have questions about motivations 动机 or effects 影响 of imperialism, go check her out. +

Let's move on to science. Cool. So positivism 实证主义 is this idea that we can figure out 弄清楚 everything that we need to know through science. Science alone provides knowledge 知识. +

Then relativism 相对主义 comes on the scene 出现. This leads to 导致 a loss of confidence in 对…失去信心 scientific knowledge 科学知识. There's a focus on 关注 irrationality 非理性 and on impulse 冲动 rather than 而不是 reason 理性 and logic 逻辑. +

Freud 弗洛伊德 talks about the struggle between 在…之间的斗争 the conscious 意识 and the subconscious 潜意识. Einstein's theory of relativity 相对论 comes into conflict with 与…冲突 everything that we used to know about the Newtonian universe 牛顿宇宙观. +

Science and physics 物理学 are no longer objective 客观的. Max Planck 马克斯·普朗克 for sure supports this idea. And this plays out 体现 socially and culturally as well. +

Nietzsche 尼采 famously proclaims 宣称 that "God is dead" “上帝已死”. This leads to 导致 modernism 现代主义 in intellectual and cultural life 知识和文化生活 that plays out 表现 in that Age of Anxiety 焦虑时代 after World War One. +

==== AP Euro Topic 7.8 - 19th-Century Culture and Art 19世纪的文化与艺术
You know what? I love art. You know why? Because artists choose to reflect 反映 everything that's happening in society, and it's beautiful. +

Romanticism 浪漫主义 is a response to 对…的回应 rationalism 理性主义, and it's awesome. There's too much focus on 过于关注 the orderly 有序的 and the rational 理性的, so let's place this focus again on 再次关注 the emotional 情感的. +

Romanticism was not only a response to 对…的回应 the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 but also to the Industrial Revolution 工业革命. And it leads to 导致 modern art 现代艺术, which is going to put the focus not on the person but the abstract 抽象, not on the objective 客观 but the subjective 主观. +

Modern art encompasses 包含 impressionism 印象派, post-impressionism 后印象派, and cubism 立体派. Cézanne 塞尚, Picasso 毕加索, Matisse 马蒂斯, and Van Gogh 梵高. +

As a response to 作为对…的回应 the Industrial Revolution 工业革命, there's a focus on 关注 nature 自然. I mean, "Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog" 《雾海上的旅人》 is the name of this painting. +

You want to talk about romantic literature 浪漫主义文学? Look no further than 看看 "Frankenstein" 《弗兰肯斯坦》, which is more powerful 强大 -- man or machine? +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 7.2 德雷福斯事件（主题 7.3 延伸）

阿尔弗雷德·德雷福斯是一位法国犹太人，他被指控向德国政府出售军事机密。他被定罪后被送往法属圭亚那的监狱。不过剧透一下——他并没有做这件事。 +
这在法国引发了大量的反犹主义。像德吕蒙这样有影响力的政治人物, 开始主张身为"法国人就应该是天主教徒"。所以出现了宗教紧张局势、宗教冲突以及反犹主义。 +

大众媒体深度参与了这一事件。埃米尔·左拉在这一事件中写下了《我控诉》。 +

审判最初发生在 1894 年，但到 1906 年，一个新政府上台并赦免了德雷福斯。毕竟——他因为莫须有的罪名在监狱里待了十多年，仅仅因为他是犹太人,就被伪造证据定罪。 +

*德雷福斯事件的主要影响有：法国进一步自由化，军队权力减弱，政教进一步分离。而且这增强了犹太复国主义*——整个欧洲对建立犹太家园的渴望。 +

我在上个视频中忘了提到，奥匈帝国建立了二元君主制，这在当时对任何人来说都不是问题。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 7.3 - 第一部分 - 国家统一与外交紧张局势（克里米亚战争）

在 1815 年，梅特涅召开了维也纳会议，试图恢复欧洲的权力平衡。但在 19 世纪，欧洲似乎把这一点抛诸脑后了。 +

我们来谈谈**克里米亚战争。简单来说：俄罗斯想要插手土耳其事务，这对东欧的很多欧洲强国构成了威胁。**然后英国和法国也参与进来，这是必然的。 +
奥地利受到俄罗斯向巴尔干地区扩张的威胁。奥地利实际上没有参与这场战争，这在后来引发了一些问题。 +

战争在克里米亚半岛爆发。英国、法国和土耳其对抗俄罗斯。对"塞瓦斯托波尔市"进行了长达一年的围攻。阿尔弗雷德·丁尼生勋爵写下了《轻骑兵的冲锋》，就是对这次围攻的回应。 +
俄罗斯新沙皇亚历山大二世——伟大的解放者——以和平结束了战争。 +

嘿，还要提一下弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔，因为她在克里米亚战争期间在医疗方面做了了不起的事情。干净的床单——谁能想到这会很重要呢？ +

*俄罗斯在克里米亚战争中的失败, 促使亚历山大二世推动了他的改革。因为奥地利没有参与战争，奥地利与俄罗斯和普鲁士疏远了。这导致了德国和意大利的统一。* +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 7.3，第二部分 - 国家统一与外交紧张局势（德国和意大利）

四天内讲两个沉重的话题——小菜一碟。 +

**克里米亚战争,导致"欧洲协调体系"瓦解，进而促成了意大利和德国的统一。**我们来谈谈这两个国家的统一。 +

在此之前，意大利在历史上从未实现过统一。你需要记住这些人：加富尔是智囊——也就是策划者。马志尼是核心——在统一之前他领导了 “青年意大利”。加里波第和他的 “红衫军” 是利剑。 +
*普法战争也对意大利的统一起到了推动作用。* +

现在我们来谈谈德国。奥托·冯·俾斯麦——一切都围绕着军事、外交和领导力。还有 “铁血政策”。 +
你需要把普法战争和俾斯麦联系起来，因为他通过一些伪造的信息, 挑起了与法国的战争，然后他们取得了胜利。 +

**"现实政治"是他和加富尔都运用的手段。**我的意思是，*实用主义政治——不一定基于道德或意识形态，而是基于实用主义。再回到马基雅维利——为达目的，不择手段。* +
*他通过联盟体系来平衡权力，目的是孤立法国。* +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 7.3 - 7.5 - 民族主义、达尔文主义以及科学和知识的发展

一篇优秀的长篇论文（LEQ）可以比较俾斯麦和拿破仑，你现在就可以练习写这样的论文。但我们继续往下讲。 +

俾斯麦在 1890 年被解职，这导致整个欧洲的紧张局势加剧——我不知道，最终引发了第一次世界大战之类的。 +
特别是当你考虑到巴尔干半岛存在的问题时，这引发了冲突——比如第一次世界大战和暗杀事件。 +

很好。除此之外，查尔斯·达尔文提出了"进化论"。赫伯特·斯宾塞说：“嘿，你知道吗？"适者生存"的理念——如果把它应用到人类社会会怎样呢？” +
这为我们所说的**"社会达尔文主义"的种族主义理论提供了依据，进而引发了新帝国主义。** +

*记住 “黄金、荣耀和上帝”。这有点类似。这一次，黄金以"资源"的形式存在，荣耀以"民族主义"的形式存在，上帝具体指的是"新教传教士"。* +

感谢工业革命带来的新发明，比如轮船、电报、米尼弹和枪支。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 7.6 进步与现代性的时代

帝国主义是我最喜欢但也最不喜欢的话题，原因很明显。“反社会研究” 涵盖了你需要了解的关于帝国主义的一切，所以如果你对帝国主义的动机或影响有疑问，可以去看看相关内容。 +

我们来谈谈科学。很好。"实证主义"认为, 我们可以通过科学弄清楚我们需要知道的一切。只有科学才能提供知识。 +

**然后"相对主义"出现了。**这导致人们对科学知识失去信心。*人们关注的是不合理性和冲动，而不是理性和逻辑。* +
弗洛伊德谈到了"意识"和"潜意识"之间的斗争。爱因斯坦的"相对论"与我们过去对牛顿宇宙的认知产生了冲突。 +
科学和物理学不再是客观的。马克斯·普朗克肯定支持这一观点。这在社会和文化方面也有所体现。 +
尼采著名地宣称 “上帝已死”。这在知识和文化生活中引发了现代主义，这种"现代主义"在第一次世界大战后的"焦虑时代"得以体现。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 7.8 - 19 世纪的文化与艺术

你知道吗？我喜欢艺术。你知道为什么吗？因为艺术家们选择反映社会上发生的一切，这很美。 +

**"浪漫主义"是对"理性主义"的回应，**它很棒。*人们过于关注秩序和理性，所以我们把关注点重新放在情感上。* +
**浪漫主义**不仅是对启蒙运动的回应，*也是对"工业革命"的回应。它催生了现代艺术，现代艺术把关注点从人物转移到抽象事物上，从客观事物, 转移到主观感受上。* +

**现代艺术包括印象派、后印象派和立体派。**比如塞尚、毕加索、马蒂斯和梵高。 +
我喜欢欧仁·德拉克罗瓦的《自由引导人民》——情感、直觉。 +
作为对工业革命的回应，人们开始关注自然。我的意思是，《雾海上的漫步者》就是这样一幅画的名字。 +

你想谈谈浪漫主义文学吗？看看《科学怪人》就知道了，它很有影响力——人还是机器？ +

==== AP Euro Topic 7.2 The Dreyfus Affair (Topic 7.2 extension)
Alfred Dreyfus was a French Jewish man who's accused of selling military secrets to the German government. He's convicted and is sent to a prison in French Guiana. But spoiler alert -- he didn't do it.

This leads to so much anti-Semitism in France. Influential political figures like Drumont are going to start advocating that to be French is to be Catholic. So religious tensions, religious conflicts, anti-Semitism.

Mass media gets super involved in all of this. The affair is also where Émile Zola writes "J'accuse."

The trial first happened in 1894, but by 1906, a new government had rolled up on the scene and actually pardoned Dreyfus. After all of this -- you know, he spent over 10 years in prison for something he didn't do, for falsified evidence because he was Jewish.

Major effects of the Dreyfus Affair: greater liberalization in France, a reduction in the power of the military, and more separation of church and state. And this increases Zionism -- this desire for a Jewish homeland across Europe.

I also forgot to mention this last video, but Austria-Hungary creates a dual monarchy, which is not going to be a problem for anyone ever.

==== AP Euro Topic 7.3 - part I - National Unification and Diplomatic Tensions (the Crimean War)
We're in 1815 when Metternich created his Congress of Vienna to try to restore this balance of power in Europe. Europe seems to not remember that either in the 1800s.

Let's talk about the Crimean War. TLDR: Russia wants to get involved in Turkey, and that threatens a lot of these European powers in Eastern Europe. And then Britain and France get involved because of course they do.

Austria is threatened by Russia's extending into the Balkan area. Austria doesn't actually get involved in this war, which leads to some problems later.

The war plays out here on the Crimean Peninsula. Britain, France, and Turkey take on Russia. The year-long siege on the city of Sevastopol. Alfred Lord Tennyson writes "The Charge of the Light Brigade" as a response specifically to the siege.

New Russian Tsar Alexander II -- the Great Liberator -- ends the war with peace.

Hey, but shout out to Florence Nightingale because she did amazing things regarding health situations during the Crimean War. Clean linens -- who would have thought that that would be important?

Loss of the Crimean War allows Alexander the Second to push for the reforms that he did. Because Austria didn't engage in it, Austria is now alienated from Russia and Prussia. This leads to German and Italian unification.

==== AP Euro Topic 7.3, part II - National Unification and Diplomatic Tensions (Germany and Italy)
Two heaviness in four days -- no sweat.

The Crimean War leads to the breakdown of the Concert of Europe, which leads to the unification of Italy and Germany. Let's talk about those.

Italy hadn't been united ever in its history before this. People you need to associate: Cavour is the brains -- aka the mastermind. Mazzini is the heart -- he led Young Italy prior to this unification. And Garibaldi and his Red Shirts are the sword.

Franco-Prussian War also plays into the unification of Italy.

So let's talk about Germany now. Otto von Bismarck -- it was all about military, diplomacy, and leadership. And also like "blood and iron."

You need to be able to associate the Franco-Prussian War with Bismarck because he instigated essentially a war with France through some falsified information, and then they win.

Realpolitik is something that he and Cavour both utilized. I mean, practical politics -- not necessarily based on morality or ideology, but pragmatism. Bring this back to Machiavelli -- it's the ends justify the means.

His balance of powers through alliance systems that intended to isolate France.

==== AP Euro Topic Topics 7.3-7.5 - Nationalism, Darwinism, and Scientific and Intellectual Development
A great LEQ essay could be comparing Bismarck and Napoleon, which you should just practice right now. But let's move on.

Bismarck was dismissed in 1890, and that leads to an increase in tensions across Europe -- which I don't know, culminates in World War One or something.

Especially when you consider that there are problems in that Balkan Peninsula, and that leads to conflict -- like World War One and assassinations.

Great. Outside of that, Charles Darwin proposes this idea of evolution. Herbert Spencer says, "Hey, you know what? The survival of the fittest idea -- what if it pertains to human society?"

This leads to a justification of racist theories that we call Social Darwinism, which then leads to new imperialism.

Remember gold, glory, and god. It's the same thing kind of. This time, gold is in the form of resources, glory is in the form of nationalism, and god is specifically related to Protestant missionaries.

Thanks, Industrial Revolution, for new inventions like the steamship, the telegraph, the Minié ball, and guns.

==== AP Euro Topics 7.6 The Age of Progress and Modernity
Imperialism is my favorite topic but also least favorite topic for obvious reasons. Anti-Social Studies has like everything that you need to know about imperialism, so if you have questions about motivations or effects of imperialism, go check her out.

Let's move on to science. Cool. So positivism is this idea that we can figure out everything that we need to know through science. Science alone provides knowledge.

Then relativism comes on the scene. This leads to a loss of confidence in scientific knowledge. There's a focus on irrationality and on impulse rather than reason and logic.

Freud talks about the struggle between the conscious and the subconscious. Einstein's theory of relativity comes into conflict with everything that we used to know about the Newtonian universe.

Science and physics are no longer objective. Max Planck for sure supports this idea. And this plays out socially and culturally as well.

Nietzsche famously proclaims that "God is dead." This leads to modernism in intellectual and cultural life that plays out in that Age of Anxiety after World War One.

==== AP Euro Topic 7.8 - 19th-Century Culture and Art
You know what? I love art. You know why? Because artists choose to reflect everything that's happening in society, and it's beautiful.

Romanticism is a response to rationalism, and it's awesome. There's too much focus on the orderly and the rational, so let's place this focus again on the emotional.

Romanticism was not only a response to the Enlightenment but also to the Industrial Revolution. And it leads to modern art, which is going to put the focus not on the person but the abstract, not on the objective but the subjective.

Modern art encompasses impressionism, post-impressionism, and cubism. Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse, and Van Gogh.

Love Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the People" -- emotion of feeling, intuition.

As a response to the Industrial Revolution, there's a focus on nature. I mean, "Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog" is the name of this painting.

You want to talk about romantic literature? Look no further than "Frankenstein," which is more powerful -- man or machine?
