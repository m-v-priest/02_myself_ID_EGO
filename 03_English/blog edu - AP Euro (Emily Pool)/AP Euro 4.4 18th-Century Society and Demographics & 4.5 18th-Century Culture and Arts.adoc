==== (4.4) 18th-Century Society and Demographics

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 4.4: 18th century society 社会 and demographics 人口统计数据. +

At this point in the course, you might be thinking, "Yeah Emily, I get it. The population 人口 is increasing, people are dying less than they used to die because medicine 医学 is advancing, and you know crops 农作物 and everything's getting better." And you're not wrong, but it's still an important part of the course, so we have to talk about it. Hopefully this video is going to be a good review of things that I have literally talked to you about before. +

Like the Agricultural Revolution 农业革命, which is leading to 导致 an increase in population because it's leading to a more steady 稳定的 food supply 食物供应. And where is that new food coming from, students? You guessed it -- the Americas 美洲. +

In the 1600s in Europe, thanks to 由于 all of the wars and the bad agricultural practices 农业生产方式 and the small surpluses 剩余产品 that persisted 持续存在 in lots of areas, agriculture 农业 was really small in scale 规模. And by the 1700s -- by the mid-1700s -- it was growing so much that the population was stabilizing 趋于稳定 and was growing back to normal levels 恢复到正常水平. +

And maybe one of my favorite things to talk about in this particular topic is Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Mary Wortley Montagu was married to 嫁给 the British ambassador 大使 to Turkey, and when she was living within the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国, she witnessed 目睹 inoculation 接种疫苗 and then brought that back with her to Britain. +

Her practices in disease prevention and control 疾病预防与控制 through inoculation 接种疫苗 led to -- kind of -- smallpox 天花 ending. Now, Edward Jenner got all of the credit for 因…获得赞誉 inventing vaccines 发明疫苗 -- which rightfully so 理应如此, he should get that credit -- but we should also highlight 强调 women, and I'm glad that the AP Euro course does in this sense. +

Thanks to 由于 advancements 进步 in the Scientific Revolution 科学革命 and inoculation 接种疫苗, child and infant mortality 儿童和婴儿死亡率 is decreasing, which means there's a bigger concern on 关注 childhood development 儿童发展 now than there used to be. This was greatly exacerbated 加剧 by Jean-Jacques Rousseau -- that Enlightenment philosopher 启蒙哲学家 who you remember focused a ton on 大量关注 childlike exploratory education 儿童探索式教育 -- because he believed that the state of nature 自然状态 -- people that were unbound by 不受…束缚 the chains of society 社会枷锁 -- existed most perfectly in childhood 童年时期. +

And this focus on 关注 childhood education 儿童教育 is concomitant with 与…相伴；伴随 -- goes hand in hand with 与…紧密相连 -- Napoleon, but we're going to get to him next unit. +

But thanks to 由于 that Agricultural Revolution 农业革命, people are now producing more food and don't need as many workers to do that. So where are you going to go if you're a poor person living in Europe in the 1700s and 1800s? To cities, because you will find jobs in cities. +

This massive 大规模的 urbanization 城市化 itself created benefits down the long run 从长远来看 because now you have a workforce 劳动力 to fuel 推动 the ever-growing Industrial Revolution 不断发展的工业革命 -- which we'll get to in unit 6, have no fear -- but also created problems because it is eroding 侵蚀 traditional communal values 传统的社区价值观. +

Now governments are strained 紧张；压力大 trying to figure out 弄清楚 all the resources 资源 for the new people living within their common areas 公共区域. It also led to 导致 an increase in poverty 贫困, crime 犯罪, and prostitution 卖淫. And people now had to figure out 想出 new ways to deal with that -- sometimes successfully, but oftentimes 经常 not successfully. +

To summarize 总结 this unit -- which should be a summary of pretty much every time we've talked about demographics 人口统计数据 so far in this course -- agricultural production 农业生产 is increasing, meaning that population 人口 is increasing, meaning that children are living longer, meaning that there's now more of a focus on 关注 kids. And also, people are moving to cities because you don't need as many farmers as you did before. +

Hope that helped. And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you. +

==== (4.5) 18th-Century Culture and Arts

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 4.5: 18th century culture 文化 and arts 艺术. +

An overarching theme 首要主题 in AP European History is cultural and intellectual developments 文化和知识发展, and a learning objective 学习目标 that is present in this unit -- and honestly most units -- is explaining how European intellectual and cultural developments changed or were maintained 保持 during a specific time period 特定时期. +

And if we're looking at this time period in unit 4, it is 1648 to 1815, students. So how did cultural and intellectual life 文化和知识生活 change during this time period as a result of 由于 the Scientific Revolution 科学革命 and the Enlightenment 启蒙运动? +

Oh boy, we got a list. +

We can now mass produce 批量生产 things. People are way more learned 有学问的 than before. And we're also sharing all of our ideas in like newspapers 报纸, periodicals 期刊, and journals 杂志, which over time 随着时间推移 leads to 导致 the development of public opinion 公众舆论的形成. +

This is a wild concept 概念 to me. Like, I know we are all on TikTok now, we're all over social media 社交媒体, we are so influenced by 受…影响 these viral trends 热门趋势. But back in the day 过去, you didn't have that same semblance of 类似；相似 public opinion 公众舆论 -- of people from a certain area all agreeing on one thing. And this is when that starts to happen. +

Once people are becoming more literate 有文化的；识字的 and once they start to read similar things, they develop, "Oh, maybe this is like my identity 身份. Oh, maybe this is what it means to be German or to be Italian." +

And somewhat related to 与…有点相关 that, Europeans are also reading and getting more exposed to 接触 non-European ways of life 非欧洲的生活方式, which is then shaping 塑造 their understanding of the world 对世界的理解. This growing perspective 视角 outside of your own specific worldview 特定的世界观 -- by bringing in literature 文学 or ideas from other parts of the world -- sometimes challenges 挑战 accepted social norms 公认的社会规范. +

Now students, I know that we've talked about the weakening of 削弱 the power of the Catholic Church 天主教会, but that doesn't mean that it's gone away. The Christian worldview 基督教世界观 still has deep roots 深厚的根基 in Europe. +

But for example, as the middle class 中产阶级 is growing, they're spending money on more things that highlight 突出 themselves rather than the church. This leads to 导致 new developments in leisure activities 休闲活动, because if you are in the middle class in Europe in the 1700s, how are you going to spend your free time 空闲时间? Going to the theater 剧院. +

Europeans start buying new things like porcelain 瓷器 from China -- which by the way, Ming Chinese vases 中国明朝花瓶 tend to 倾向于 be white and blue, and we see an explosion 激增 in white and blue back in the Iberian Peninsula 伊比利亚半岛 in Spain and Portugal because Portugal was real involved in 参与 that Indian Ocean trade 印度洋贸易. +

The art 艺术 that is created during the 17th century also reflects 反映 these new Enlightenment values 启蒙运动的新价值观. And remember, when I'm saying art, I'm not only talking about visual arts 视觉艺术 but also the written word 文学作品 and also musical art 音乐艺术. +

The Dutch Golden Age 荷兰黄金时代 and Dutch paintings 荷兰绘画 and Vermeer 维米尔 are all about highlighting 强调 that Protestant work ethic 新教职业道德观. Jane Austen writes all of her novels 小说 that we all know and love today, which you know highlight 突出 gender roles 性别角色 in relationships 人际关系. +

In a continued change in European society 欧洲社会的持续变化中 is that art 艺术 is no longer celebrating 赞美 the religious 宗教. It is celebrating the common people 普通人 and the public good 公共利益 rather than emphasizing 强调 religious feeling 宗教情感 and state power 国家权力 through Baroque art 巴洛克艺术. +

Art now transitions to 转变为 Neoclassicism 新古典主义, which is going to emphasize 强调 civic virtue 公民美德 and participation 参与. And the arts in general 总体上 start to reflect 反映 the new consumer revolution 消费革命 and the new bourgeois society 资产阶级社会. +

If we're going back to that original learning objective 最初的学习目标 that I stated at the beginning of this video -- explain how European culture and intellectual developments were changed or maintained 保持 during this time period -- y'all, they changed. +

And what you should do right now to make sure that you were paying attention 注意；专注 is summarize 总结 how they changed. +

I hope that helped. And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you. +

==== （4.4）18世纪的社会与人口统计学

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题4.4：18世纪的社会与人口统计学。 +

在本课程的这个阶段，你们可能会想：“好的，艾米丽，我懂了。人口在增长，由于医学的发展，死亡的人数比过去少了，而且农作物之类的一切都在变好。” 你们说得没错，但这仍然是课程中重要的一部分，所以我们必须讨论它。希望这个视频能很好地复习我之前跟你们讲过的内容。 +

比如**农业革命（Agricultural Revolution），它导致了人口的增长，因为它带来了更稳定的食物供应。同学们，这些新的食物来自哪里呢？你们猜对了——美洲（the Americas）。** +

**在17世纪的欧洲，**由于各种战争、糟糕的农业实践, 以及许多地区持续存在的少量剩余物资，农业的**规模非常小。而到了18世纪——到18世纪中期——农业大幅发展，**人口趋于稳定并恢复到正常水平。 +

在这个特定主题中，我最喜欢谈论的事情之一就是玛丽·沃特利·蒙塔古夫人（Lady Mary Wortley Montagu）。玛丽·沃特利·蒙塔古嫁给了英国驻土耳其大使，她在奥斯曼帝国（Ottoman Empire）生活时，见证了"接种"（inoculation），并将其带回了英国。 +
**她通过"接种"来预防和控制疾病的做法, 在一定程度上终结了天花。**现在，爱德华·詹纳（Edward Jenner）因发明疫苗, 而获得了所有赞誉——他确实应该得到这份荣誉——但我们也应该突出女性的贡献，我很高兴AP欧洲历史课程在这方面有所体现。 +

由于科学革命（Scientific Revolution）和接种技术的进步，儿童和婴儿的死亡率在下降，这意味着现在人们比过去更关注儿童的发展。让 - 雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）进一步加剧了这一点——你们记得这位启蒙哲学家非常关注儿童的探索性教育——因为他认为自然状态下的人——不受社会束缚的人——在童年时期最完美地存在。 +
这种对儿童教育的关注, 与拿破仑（Napoleon）也有关联，但我们将在下一单元讲到他。 +

**但是由于农业革命，人们现在生产的食物更多了，而且生产这些食物也不需要那么多工人。**那么，如果你是18世纪和19世纪生活在欧洲的穷人，*你会去哪里呢？去城市，因为你能在城市里找到工作。* +
这种大规模的城市化, 从长远来看带来了好处，因为**现在有劳动力来推动不断发展的"工业革命"**（Industrial Revolution）——我们将在第六单元讲到，别担心——*但它也带来了问题，因为它正在侵蚀传统的"社区价值观"。* +

现在，政府在努力为生活在其辖区内的新居民提供各种资源时, 面临压力。**这也导致了贫困、犯罪和卖淫现象的增加。**人们现在必须想出新的方法来应对这些问题——有时成功了，但往往并不成功。 +

总结一下这个单元——这几乎是对我们到目前为止, 在课程中讨论过的"人口统计学"内容的总结——农业生产在增加，这意味着人口在增长，这意味着儿童的寿命更长，这意味着现在人们更加关注儿童。而且，人们搬到城市，因为不需要像以前那么多的农民。 +

希望这对你们有帮助。同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

==== （4.5）18世纪的文化与艺术

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题4.5：18世纪的文化与艺术。 +
AP欧洲历史的一个总体主题, 是文化和知识的发展，而且这个单元（说实话，在大多数单元中也是如此）的一个学习目标, 是解释在特定时期欧洲的知识和文化发展, 是如何"变化"或"(继承)保持"的。 +

同学们，我们在第四单元关注的这个时期是1648年到1815年。*那么，由于科学革命（Scientific Revolution）和启蒙运动（Enlightenment），这个时期的文化和知识生活是如何变化的呢？* +
哎呀，我们有一系列的内容。 +

我们现在可以大规模生产东西。人们比以前博学得多。而且**我们也通过报纸、期刊和杂志分享我们的想法，**随着时间的推移，*这导致了"公众舆论"（public opinion）的形成。* +
对我来说，这是一个很疯狂的概念。就像，我知道我们现在都在玩抖音（TikTok），我们都沉浸在社交媒体中，我们都深受这些热门趋势的影响。但**在过去，没有那种"公众舆论"的雏形——那种某个地区的人们都对一件事达成共识的情况。而在这个时期，这种情况开始出现了。** +

一旦人们的识字率提高，一旦他们开始阅读类似的东西，他们就会想：“哦，也许这就是我的身份认同。哦，也许这就是成为德国人或意大利人的意义。” +

与此相关的是，欧洲人也在阅读, 并更多地接触到非欧洲的生活方式，这进而塑造了他们对世界的理解。这种通过引入世界其他地方的文学或思想, 来拓展自身世界观的做法，有时会挑战被普遍接受的社会规范。 +

同学们，我知道我们已经讨论过天主教会（Catholic Church）权力的削弱，但这并不意味着它消失了。基督教的世界观在欧洲仍然根深蒂固。 +

但例如，**随着中产阶级的壮大，他们把钱花在更多能凸显自己的东西上，而不是花在教会身上。这导致了休闲活动的新发展，**因为如果你是18世纪欧洲的中产阶级，你会如何度过你的空闲时间呢？*去剧院。* +
欧洲人开始购买像中国瓷器这样的新东西——顺便说一下，中国明朝的花瓶往往是青花瓷，在西班牙和葡萄牙的伊比利亚半岛（Iberian Peninsula），青花瓷大量出现，因为葡萄牙深度参与了印度洋贸易。 +

17世纪创作的艺术也反映了这些新的启蒙价值观。记住，当我说艺术时，我不仅指视觉艺术，还包括文字艺术和音乐艺术。 +
荷兰黄金时代（Dutch Golden Age）、荷兰绘画以及维米尔（Vermeer）的作品, 都突出了"新教"的职业道德。简·奥斯汀（Jane Austen）写出了我们如今熟知并喜爱的所有小说，这些小说突出了人际关系中的性别角色。 +

*#欧洲社会持续的变化在于，艺术不再赞美宗教。它赞美普通人以及公共利益，而不是通过巴洛克艺术（Baroque art）强调宗教情感和国家权力。#* +
*艺术现在转向了"新古典主义"（Neoclassicism），它强调公民美德和参与。总体而言，艺术开始反映新的消费革命和新的资产阶级社会。* +

如果我们回到我在这个视频开头提到的最初的学习目标——解释在这个时期欧洲的文化和知识发展, 是如何变化或保持的——大家，它们发生了变化。 +
为了确保你们一直在认真听讲，你们现在应该总结一下它们是如何变化的。 +

希望这对你们有帮助。同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

==== (4.4) 18th-Century Society and Demographics

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 4.4: 18th century society and demographics.

At this point in the course, you might be thinking, "Yeah Emily, I get it. The population's increasing, people are dying less than they used to die because medicine's increasing, and you know crops and everything's getting better." And you're not wrong, but it's still an important part of the course, so we have to talk about it.

And by the 1700s -- by the mid-1700s -- it was growing so much that the population was stabilizing and was growing back to normal levels.

And maybe one of my favorite things to talk about in this particular topic is Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Mary Wortley Montagu was married to the British ambassador to Turkey, and when she was living within the Ottoman Empire, she witnessed inoculation and then brought that back with her to Britain.

Her practices in disease prevention and control through inoculation led to -- kind of -- smallpox ending. Now, Edward Jenner got all of the credit for inventing vaccines -- which rightfully so, he should get that credit -- but we should also highlight women, and I'm glad that the AP Euro course does in this sense.

Thanks to advancements in the Scientific Revolution and inoculation, child and infant mortality is decreasing, which means there's a bigger concern on childhood development now than there used to be. This was greatly exacerbated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau -- that Enlightenment philosopher who you remember focused a ton on childlike exploratory education -- because he believed that the state of nature -- people that were unbound by the chains of society -- existed most perfectly in childhood.

==== (4.5) 18th-Century Culture and Arts

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 4.5: 18th century culture and arts.

An overarching theme in AP European History is cultural and intellectual developments, and a learning objective that is present in this unit -- and honestly most units -- is explaining how European intellectual and cultural developments changed or were maintained during a specific time period.

And if we're looking at this time period in unit 4, it is 1648 to 1815, students. So how did cultural and intellectual life change during this time period as a result of the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment?

Oh boy, we got a list.

We can now mass produce things. People are way more learned than before. And we're also sharing all of our ideas in like newspapers, periodicals, and journals, which over time leads to the development of public opinion.

This is a wild concept to me. Like, I know we are all on TikTok now, we're all over social media, we are so influenced by these viral trends. But back in the day, you didn't have that same semblance of public opinion -- of people from a certain area all agreeing on one thing. And this is when that starts to happen.

Once people are becoming more literate and once they start to read similar things, they develop, "Oh, maybe this is like my identity. Oh, maybe this is what it means to be German or to be Italian."

And somewhat related to that, Europeans are also reading and getting more exposed to non-European ways of life, which is then shaping their understanding of the world. This growing perspective outside of your own specific worldview -- by bringing in literature or ideas from other parts of the world -- sometimes challenges accepted social norms.

Now students, I know that we've talked about the weakening of the power of the Catholic Church, but that doesn't mean that it's gone away. The Christian worldview still has deep roots in Europe.

But for example, as the middle class is growing, they're spending money on more things that highlight themselves rather than the church. This leads to new developments in leisure activities, because if you are in the middle class in Europe in the 1700s, how are you going to spend your free time? Going to the theater.

Europeans start buying new things like porcelain from China -- which by the way, Ming Chinese vases tend to be white and blue, and we see an explosion in white and blue back in the Iberian Peninsula in Spain and Portugal because Portugal was real involved in that Indian Ocean trade.

The art that is created during the 17th century also reflects these new Enlightenment values. And remember, when I'm saying art, I'm not only talking about visual arts but also the written word and also musical art.

The Dutch Golden Age and Dutch paintings and Vermeer are all about highlighting that Protestant work ethic. Jane Austen writes all of her novels that we all know and love today, which you know highlight gender roles in relationships.

In a continued change in European society is that art is no longer celebrating the religious. It is celebrating the common people and the public good rather than emphasizing religious feeling and state power through Baroque art.

Art now transitions to Neoclassicism, which is going to emphasize civic virtue and participation. And the arts in general start to reflect the new consumer revolution and the new bourgeois society.

If we're going back to that original learning objective that I stated at the beginning of this video -- explain how European culture and intellectual developments were changed or maintained during this time period -- y'all, they changed.

And what you should do right now to make sure that you were paying attention is summarize how they changed.

I hope that helped. And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.
