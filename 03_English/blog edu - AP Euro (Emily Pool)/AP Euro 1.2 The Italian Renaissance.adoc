Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about the Italian Renaissance 文艺复兴. Once these Europeans got access to 接近；可以使用 Greek and Roman texts 文本, there was a rebirth 重生；复兴 or Renaissance of learning in Europe, and there was a thematic 主题的 shift 转变；变化 in learning.
 +
While the Middle Ages was called the age of faith and it was dominated by 由……主宰；受……支配 Theology 神学 and a focus on religious studies and texts, the Renaissance was a focus toward secular 世俗的；非宗教的 humanism 人文主义 and individualism 个人主义. Secularism 世俗主义 means worldly 世俗的；尘世的, and humanism means that there is a focus on human individual and achievement 成就.
 +
One of the first humanists was actually an Italian in the 1300s whose name was Petrarch. Petrarch was actually the one who coined 创造；杜撰 the term 术语 the Dark Ages to refer to 指的是；提及 Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire. He was like, "Hey, this time period is actually dark because it represents 代表；象征 a loss of collective 集体的；共同的 learning, and Europe is about to enter into 进入 its Renaissance, its rebirth, because it is gaining access to these texts, these Greek and Roman ideals 理念；理想 that had been lost to Europe for a long time."
 +
So while Petrarch is studying classic 经典的 Roman texts like that of Cicero, there's another Italian humanist named Marsilio Ficino who is studying Greek texts in a really similar way. And all of these early humanist philosophers 哲学家 start to look at these ancient 古代的；古老的 texts and start to compare 比较 and compile 编纂；汇编 them together in order to establish 建立；确立 a new base of learning.
 +
And these early humanists are challenging 挑战 traditionally held sources of power, specifically 特别；具体地说 that of the Catholic Church 天主教会. The focus of a lot of education during the Middle Ages was Theology and was writing and rewriting and interpreting 解释；阐释 religious texts. With this revival 复兴；复苏 of Civic 公民的 humanism found in Greek and Roman texts, there's a shift in academic 学术的 focus from just Theology and religion to now more diverse 多样的；不同的 academic interests.
 +
And because these Europeans are now gaining access to new technologies from African and Asian civilizations 文明, there's now a new focus on scientific advancement 进步；发展 and scientific learning as well. All of this learning is able to happen because of the printing press 印刷机. Rather than 而不是 literally 真正地；确实地 writing and rewriting texts over again, the printing press allows you to mass produce 大量生产 paper and mass produce literature 文学作品.
 +
This is going to have drastic 激烈的；巨大的 effects that are going to impact 影响 every subsequent 随后的；后来的 unit in AP European history, but for right now, it's allowing people to have more access to new literature, and it's leading to 导致 an increase in literacy 读写能力 across Europe.
 +
We have an increasingly 越来越多地 literate 有读写能力的 population. We have a population that is becoming focused more on the individual and human achievement. And what are they going to do with all of that? Well, they're going to make sure that they maintain 维持；保持 and have their own power, which means that new political models of behavior emerge on the scene 出现；登场.
 +
Remember, when Europe gets hooked up to 与……连接；与……联系 the rest of the world due to 由于 the Crusades 十字军东征, these trading cities in Italy that are controlling trade coming into the continent 大陆 of Europe -- like Venice and Genoa -- start to grow in power and influence 影响力. These new political theorists 理论家 like Niccolò Machiavelli try to encourage 鼓励 these New Elites 新精英 how they should govern 统治；治理 and how they should treat their people.
 +
Machiavelli in his seminal 有重大影响的；影响深远的 work The Prince says it's better to be feared than loved and that the ends justify the means 目的证明手段正当. Basically, you should do whatever you want to do in order to maintain and gain power.
 +
In a specific way, to make sure that you were showing off 炫耀 your wealth and power during this time period was the commissioning 委托制作 of art. Y'all, if you think about it, the same is still kind of true today. If you have a lot of money, what do you want to do with it? To show off that you have a lot of money, you want to buy really fancy 昂贵的；精美的 famous pieces of art.
 +
In the Italian Renaissance, both popes 教皇 and New Elites start to show off their wealth and their glories 荣耀；光荣 by commissioning really famous paintings. Of course, these new paintings are going to reflect 反映；表现 the classical style found originally 起初；原来 in Greece and Rome, but their new painting style stayed in stark contrast to 与……形成鲜明对比 what existed in the Middle Ages in Europe because, you know, they've now developed geometric 几何的 perspective 透视法 and a focal point 焦点 and a vanishing point 灭点.
 +
Catholic Popes commission people like Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel 西斯廷教堂 or to sculpt 雕刻 things like Pietà. Raphael famously paints his School of Athens in the Vatican Museums 梵蒂冈博物馆, and the Medici family in Florence asked Brunelleschi to create his famous dome 圆顶.
 +
So in summary 总之, the Italian Renaissance marks this shift away from just religion and Theology and toward secular humanism. We see this play out 展开；发生 in art. We see this play out in literature. We see this play out in an increase in academic interests that are outside of just what the church decrees 颁布；命令.
 +
Because the Catholic Church is losing power as a result of 由于 this, New Elites are gaining power, and they are doing everything they can to show off their wealth and power, specifically through commissioning art and architecture 建筑；建筑学.
 +
I hope that helps. As always, you can do it. I believe in you.

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P（Emily P）。让我们来谈谈意大利"文艺复兴"（Italian Renaissance）吧。一旦这些欧洲人接触到了希腊和罗马的文本，欧洲就迎来了一场学术的重生，也就是文艺复兴（Renaissance），并且在学术方面出现了一个主题性的转变。 +

**#中世纪（Middle Ages）被称为信仰的时代，它由神学（Theology）主导，重点是宗教研究和宗教文本，而文艺复兴则专注于世俗人文主义（secular humanism）和个人主义（individualism）。#**世俗主义（Secularism）意味着尘世的，而**人文主义（humanism）意味着关注人类个体和成就。** +

实际上，最早的人文主义者之一是14世纪的一个意大利人，他的名字叫彼特拉克（Petrarch）。实际上，**正是彼特拉克创造了“黑暗时代（the Dark Ages）”这个术语，用来指代罗马帝国（Roman Empire）灭亡后的欧洲。**他的观点是：“嘿，*这个时期实际上是黑暗的，因为它代表着集体知识的缺失，而欧洲即将进入它的文艺复兴，也就是重生，因为它正在接触到这些长期以来在欧洲失传的文本，这些希腊和罗马的理念。*” +

所以，当彼特拉克在研究像西塞罗（Cicero）这样的古罗马经典文本时，还有另一位意大利人文主义者，名叫马尔西利奥·费奇诺（Marsilio Ficino），他也以非常相似的方式在研究希腊文本。所有这些早期的人文主义哲学家开始研究这些古代文本，并开始对它们进行比较和编纂，以便建立一个新的学术基础。 +

而且**#这些早期的人文主义者, 正在挑战传统上被认为的权力来源，特别是天主教会（Catholic Church）的权力。#**中世纪时期，很多教育的重点是神学，以及撰写、改写和解读宗教文本。随着在希腊和罗马文本中发现的"公民人文主义"（Civic humanism）的复兴，*学术重点从仅仅关注神学和宗教，转变为现在更加多样化的学术兴趣。* +

并且因为这些欧洲人现在能够接触到来自非洲和亚洲文明的新技术，所以**现在也出现了对科学进步和科学学习的新关注。**所有这些学习之所以能够实现，*都要归功于印刷机*（printing press）。印刷机使得人们无需一遍又一遍地手写和重写文本，而是可以大规模生产纸张和文学作品。 +

这将产生巨大的影响，并且会影响到美国大学预修课程（AP）欧洲历史后续的每一个单元，但就目前而言，*它让人们能够更多地接触到新的文学作品，并且导致了整个欧洲识字率的提高。* +

我们拥有越来越多识字的人口。我们的人口越来越关注个人和人类的成就。那么他们会用这些能力做些什么呢？嗯，他们会确保自己能够维护并拥有自己的权力，*这意味着新的政治行为模式出现在了历史舞台上。* +

记住，当欧洲因为十字军东征（Crusades）与世界其他地方建立联系时，意大利的这些贸易城市，比如控制着进入欧洲大陆贸易的威尼斯（Venice）和热那亚（Genoa），开始在权力和影响力方面不断增长。像尼可罗·马基雅维利（Niccolò Machiavelli）这样的新政治理论家, 试图鼓励这些新精英们应该如何治理国家, 以及应该如何对待他们的人民。 +

**马基雅维利**在他的开创性著作《君主论（The Prince）》中**说，#被人畏惧, 比被人爱戴更好，而且目的能证明手段的正当性(这是一种"以结果论英雄"的思想)。#**基本上，为了维护和获取权力，你应该做任何你想做的事情。 +


**在那个时期，一种具体的展示财富和权力的方式, 就是委托创作艺术品。**大家想一想，这在今天某种程度上仍然是正确的。如果你有很多钱，你想用它做什么呢？为了炫耀你有很多钱，你会想买非常昂贵且著名的艺术品。 +

在意大利文艺复兴时期，**教皇（popes）和新精英们都开始通过委托创作非常著名的画作, 来炫耀他们的财富和荣耀。**当然，这些新画作会反映出最初在希腊和罗马发现的古典风格，**但它们的新绘画风格, 与中世纪欧洲存在的绘画风格形成了鲜明的对比，因为，**你知道，*他们现在已经发展出了几何透视法*，还有一个焦点和一个消失点。 +

天主教教皇（Catholic Popes）委托像米开朗基罗（Michelangelo）这样的人, 来绘制西斯廷教堂（Sistine Chapel）的壁画，或者雕刻像《哀悼基督》（Pietà）这样的作品。拉斐尔（Raphael）在梵蒂冈博物馆（Vatican Museums）绘制的著名的《雅典学院》（School of Athens），以及佛罗伦萨（Florence）的美第奇家族（Medici family）请布鲁内莱斯基（Brunelleschi）建造了他著名的穹顶。 +

所以，总而言之，意大利文艺复兴标志着从仅仅关注宗教和神学，向"世俗人文主义"的转变。我们在艺术中看到了这一点的体现。我们在文学中看到了这一点的体现。我们在不仅仅是教会所规定的学术兴趣的增加中, 看到了这一点的体现。 +

由于天主教会因此失去了权力，新精英们获得了权力，并且他们正在尽其所能地炫耀他们的财富和权力，特别是通过委托创作艺术品和建筑作品。 +

我希望这对你有帮助。一如既往，你能做到的。我相信你。 +

Because the Catholic Church is losing power as a result of this, New Elites are gaining power, and they are doing everything they can to show off their wealth and power, specifically through commissioning art and architecture.

I hope that helps. As always, you can do it. I believe in you.
