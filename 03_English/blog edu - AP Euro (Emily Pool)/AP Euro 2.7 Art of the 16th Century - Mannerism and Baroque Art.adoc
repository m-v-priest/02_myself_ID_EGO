Students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about mannerism 风格主义 and baroque art 巴洛克艺术. +

Again, I'm wearing my Artemisia shirt because I love her so much, and this is a great example of baroque art 巴洛克艺术. Because when you think of the word "Baroque" 巴洛克式的；（艺术、建筑、音乐等）高度装饰的，极尽奢华的, I need you to think of the word "drama" 戏剧；戏剧性事件；戏剧性效果 — as dramatic 戏剧性的；激动人心的；引人注目的 as possible, as emotional 情感上的；情绪激动的 as possible, in order to elicit 引出；诱出；唤起 a specific response 反应；回应 from the viewer 观看者；观众. Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith Beheading Holofernes is a great example of baroque art 巴洛克艺术 that was commissioned 委托制作；委任；任命 by the Catholic Church 天主教会. Bernini's The Ecstasy of St Teresa is also a great example of Baroque art 巴洛克艺术 because it focuses on an Ursuline nun 乌尔苏拉会修女, St Teresa of Ávila, pierced 刺穿；刺破 through the heart by an angel 天使. And look at her face; it shows such longing 渴望；向往 and passion 激情；热情 and ecstasy 狂喜；入迷 as Bernini would say. +

And students, as you know, it is not only the Catholic church that is commissioning 委托制作；委任；任命 these new pieces of baroque art 巴洛克艺术. It is also monarchs 君主；帝王 trying to reassert 重申；再次坚持 their control over a population. While this is slightly 轻微地；稍微地 out of this current time period, Versailles 凡尔赛宫 is a great example. +

The way that I like to think about mannerist art 风格主义艺术 is that it's like emo Renaissance art 文艺复兴艺术. You know how the Renaissance 文艺复兴（欧洲 14 到 16 世纪的文化运动） was characterized by 以…为特征 the very perfect ideal 理想；典范 — like a ripped body 健美的身体 in human form 人类形态. Mannerists 风格主义艺术家 are like, "No, no. We want distortion 扭曲；变形；曲解. We want drama 戏剧；戏剧性事件；戏剧性效果. We want the dark colors." Both El Greco and Tintoretto are great examples of mannerist artists 风格主义艺术家. +

And if you struggle 艰难地行进；努力；挣扎 at recognizing artistic movements 艺术运动 over time, make sure that you check out 查看；观察 this really silly video that I made on TikTok last year as an AP art history review 艺术史复习. It should help you out. +

And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you. +

同学们，我是艾米丽·P。咱们来聊聊风格主义（Mannerism）和巴洛克艺术（Baroque art）吧。 +

我又穿上了印有阿尔泰米西娅（Artemisia）画作的衬衫，因为我太喜欢她了，而她的画作就是巴洛克艺术的一个绝佳范例。因为**当你想到 “巴洛克” 这个词时，我希望你能想到 “戏剧性”——尽可能地富有戏剧性，尽可能地充满情感，以便从观赏者那里引出特定的反应。**阿尔泰米西娅·真蒂莱斯基的《朱迪斯砍下霍洛芬斯的头颅》就是天主教会（Catholic Church）委托创作的巴洛克艺术的一个很好的例子。贝尼尼（Bernini）的《圣特蕾莎的狂喜》也是巴洛克艺术的一个很好的例子，因为它描绘的是乌尔苏拉修女（Ursuline nun）阿维拉的圣特蕾莎（St Teresa of Ávila）被一位天使刺穿心脏的场景。看看她的表情，正如贝尼尼所说，它展现出了如此的渴望、激情和狂喜。 +

同学们，如你们所知，**委托创作这些新巴洛克艺术作品的, 不只是天主教会, 君主们也试图重申他们对民众的控制。**虽然这有点超出了当前的时间段，但凡尔赛宫（Versailles）就是一个很好的例子。 +

我对"风格主义艺术"的理解是，它就像是 “情绪化” 的文艺复兴艺术。你们知道**文艺复兴的特点是"非常完美的理想形象"——比如有着"完美身材"的人体形象。而风格主义者们则说：“不，不。我们想要扭曲。我们想要戏剧性。**我们想要深色调。” 埃尔·格列柯（El Greco）和丁托列托（Tintoretto）都是"风格主义"艺术家的很好的例子。 +

如果你们在识别不同时期的艺术运动方面有困难，一定要看看我去年在TikTok上制作的那个很有趣的AP艺术史复习视频。它应该能帮到你们。 +

同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +
