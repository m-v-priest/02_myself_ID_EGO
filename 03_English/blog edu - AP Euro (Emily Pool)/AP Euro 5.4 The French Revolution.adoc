Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 5.4: The French Revolution 法国大革命. +

Now here's the deal. I bet your teacher did a phenomenal 非凡的；出色的 job covering 讲解 the French Revolution because it's everyone's favorite revolution. The chaos 混乱, the bloodshed 流血事件, Robespierre 罗伯斯庇尔, the guillotine 断头台 -- I mean, it's stunning 令人震惊的 to study. +

Because of that, I'm going to keep this video short, sweet, and to the point 切中要点 about exactly what you need to know based on the course exam description 课程考试说明 from the AP European History test. And if you're taking notes, let's break this up into 分为 causes 原因, major events 重大事件, and effects 影响. +

Got long-term political and social causes 长期政治和社会原因 and short-term economic causes 短期经济原因. Let's break this down 分析一下. +

Socially 社会层面, the Third Estate 第三等级 in France -- the bottom of that social hierarchy 社会等级制度 that made up 构成 98% of the population -- was having a real rough go 日子非常艰难. They paid all of the taxes 纳税, and there also happened to be a famine 饥荒, and bread prices were increasing drastically 急剧上涨, which means that they were now not only poor but also hangry 又穷又饿. +

Politically 政治层面, if you remember in the 1700s, Louis XIV 路易十四 had fought disastrous wars 灾难性战争 that threw France into debt 使法国陷入债务, and then France helped support the colonists 殖民者 fight against the British in the American Revolution 美国独立战争. And then the peasants 农民 were like, "Hey, this doesn't make any sense. If you are funding 资助 other people's wars but you're not giving us money, and there's a bread shortage 面包短缺, what are we going to do?" +

Inspired by 受…启发 Enlightenment philosophers 启蒙哲学家, the Third Estate also desired 渴望 more political representation 政治代表权 -- of which they had almost none -- because the First Estate 第一等级, the Second Estate 第二等级, and the Third Estate all had one vote total 总票数相同, even though that Third Estate made up 98% of the population. +

And the First Estate and the Second Estate always wanted to work together 合作 because, of course, the clergy 神职人员 and the nobility 贵族 want to keep their social status 社会地位 and political power 政治权力. +

So there has been a history of social, political, and economic disparities 不平等 among the estate system 等级制度, and then you know, throw famine into the mix 再加上饥荒, and wow, it is a ripe time 成熟时机 for a revolution 革命. +

The revolution itself existed in two phases 阶段: the liberal or moderate phase 自由或温和阶段 and the radical phase 激进阶段. +

Inspired by the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 and also the Declaration of Independence 美国独立宣言, the French National Assembly 法国国民议会 wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen 人权和公民权宣言. That National Assembly was very active 活跃 because they also passed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy 教士民事组织法, they divided France into districts 把法国划分为多个行政区, and they abolished feudal privileges 废除封建特权. +

They were really trying to get rid of 废除 that old Ancien Régime 旧制度 in France, and boy did they -- with writing a constitution of 1791 that they then forced King Louis XVI 路易十六 to sign. +

Man, that National Assembly got a lot done in the first three years of the revolution. But then, outside forces 外部势力 try to get involved in 介入 what's going on in France -- specifically Austria 奥地利 and Prussia 普鲁士 -- because you know, Marie Antoinette 玛丽·安托瓦内特 was Austrian after all. +

And then France declares war on 向…宣战 them, and then everything just descends into chaos 陷入混乱. +

After Jean - Paul Marat 让 - 保罗·马拉 starts writing L'Ami du Peuple 《人民之友报》, which really inspires people to turn radical 变得激进, 1793 -- two years after he signed the constitution -- King Louis XVI was put on trial for 因…受审 treason 叛国罪 and then was beheaded 斩首 by a guillotine 断头台. +

Just a reminder, students, this is not the first time that we have seen regicide 弑君 in AP Euro because we always got to look back way back to the English Civil War 英国内战 with the beheading of Charles I 查理一世. +

With the beheading of Louis XVI, the revolution enters into its radical phase 激进阶段. Robespierre 罗伯斯庇尔 and his Jacobin faction 雅各宾派 enter France into the Reign of Terror 恐怖统治时期, in which thousands of people who are enemies of the revolution 革命的敌人 are guillotined 被送上断头台. +

But I will give Robespierre this: during his leadership, he did two notable things 两件值得注意的事. Number one, he converts 使转变 France to using the metric system 公制, which is helpful and is something that the US should be on today. And number two, he sets the Laws of the Maximum 最高限价法, which sets the maximum price 最高价格 that you can sell grain 谷物 at. +

Wanting to remove all the vestiges of 消除…的所有痕迹 the Ancien Régime 旧制度, Jacques - René Hébert 雅克 - 勒内·埃贝尔 practices dechristianization 去基督教化, in which he's trying to remove all vestiges of Christianity 基督教痕迹 and the influence of the Catholic Church 天主教会的影响 in France. +

This results in 导致 the creation of a new calendar system 新历法 with 10 - day weeks. Also results in Notre - Dame 巴黎圣母院 turning into the Temple of Reason 理性圣殿 and the rise of the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being 自然神论的最高主宰崇拜. +

Speaking of 说到 that Cult of the Supreme Being 最高主宰崇拜, Robespierre kind of acts like he might be the head 首领 or the god of this new cult, so then he ends up getting beheaded 被斩首 in 1794. +

His death ends the Reign of Terror 恐怖统治时期 and also leads to 导致 the rise of a five - man Directory 五人督政府 who rules over 统治 France until eventually Napoleon throws a coup d'état 发动政变. +

With the basics of the French Revolution covered 涵盖了法国大革命的基本内容, I need to talk about two more things: mass conscription 大规模征兵 and also women's involvement 女性的参与. +

Remember how I said that Prussia and Austria declared war on 向…宣战 France? Yeah, France decides to fight back 反击 by raising armies through levée en masse 全民动员 or mass conscription 大规模征兵 in order to not only fight against Prussia and Austria but to fight against the vestiges of 残余 the Ancien Régime that exists elsewhere in Europe. +

Inspired and mobilized by 受…启发和动员 the revolution, these soldiers wanted to then bring the changes that they were bringing in France to other parts of Europe. Also, a general named Napoleon 拿破仑 wins some pretty important battles in Italy. +

And lastly, let's end with 以…结束 women's involvement in the French Revolution because they had so much agency 影响力. This is the time when we start to see women being the protagonist 主角 in the story. +

After the signing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen 人权和公民权宣言, the poissardes 卖鱼女 -- the fish ladies of Paris -- did not believe that King Louis and Marie Antoinette would actually follow it, so they marched on to 向…进军 Versailles 凡尔赛宫 that October, marched onto Versailles, and forced King Louis and Marie Antoinette to move back to Paris rather than outside of the city so that they could be kept a watch over 被监视. +

And inspired by the DRMC (as I lovingly call it), Olympe de Gouges 奥林普·德·古热 writes the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen 妇女和女公民权利宣言. +

So women who have been inspired by the Enlightenment to almost the equal extent that men have 受到与男性几乎同等程度的启蒙运动启发 are now active players 积极参与者 in what's going on. And while that seems great, and while they fought for more legal privileges 法律特权, as soon as the Republic 共和国 was created after the death of Louis XVI, citizenship 公民身份 was soon restricted only to men. +

They wanted to improve some things in the Ancien Régime but not all things. +

While I said I was going to talk only about the things that you absolutely needed to know, I do want to end this by talking about justice for Marie Antoinette 为玛丽·安托瓦内特伸张正义 because y'all -- oh, she gets such a bad go 遭遇如此糟糕 in history, and it is not deserved 不应得的. +

She was 14 years old when she was married off to 嫁给 Louis XVI, and then she inherits 继承 all of the problems of France and also inherits all of the wealth of France. And if you are a 14 - year - old girl who now has just like the most money you could ever imagine, what are you going to do with it? Spend it. +

You also have a husband who doesn't consummate the marriage 圆房 for 7 years, which probably puts you in a pretty bad position 处境糟糕 because your one job as a queen is to birth a male son 生下男性继承人, and you haven't done that yet because your husband literally won't do it. +

And don't get me started with the fact that everyone blamed Marie for the problems. It is not Marie's fault. It's Louis XVI's fault. He was such a terrible king. +

Even considering the differences in their deaths: Marie was wheeled to the guillotine 被送上断头台 in a tumbrel 敞篷货车, which is an open - air carriage 敞篷马车, which means that she was jeered 嘲笑 and had things thrown at her the entire time that she was taken -- 8 months after her husband died -- to her death. +

I could go on and on, but I like to keep these videos short. So students, as always, you can do it. I believe in you. And never forget: justice for Marie. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题5.4：法国大革命。 +

事情是这样的。我敢说你们的老师在讲解法国大革命时, 肯定讲得非常精彩，因为这是大家最喜欢的一场革命。其中的混乱、流血事件、罗伯斯庇尔（Robespierre）、断头台——我的意思是，研究起来非常震撼。 +
正因如此，我会让这个视频简短、精彩，并且紧扣AP欧洲历史考试的课程考试描述中大家需要了解的内容。如果你们在做笔记，我们可以把它分为原因、重大事件和影响。 +
**#原因包括长期的政治和社会原因, 以及短期的经济原因。#**我们来详细分析一下。 +

从社会层面来看，*法国的第三等级——占社会人口98%的社会底层——日子过得非常艰难。他们承担了所有的赋税*，而且还遭遇了饥荒，面包价格大幅上涨，这意味着他们不仅贫穷，还饥肠辘辘。 +

**从政治层面来看，你们还记得在18世纪，路易十四（Louis XIV）发动了灾难性的战争，让法国陷入了债务危机，而且法国还帮助美洲殖民者反抗英国。**然后农民们就想：“嘿，这说不通啊。如果你们资助别人打仗，却不给我们钱，而且还出现了面包短缺，我们该怎么办？” +

*#受到启蒙哲学家的启发，第三等级也渴望获得更多的政治代表权——他们几乎没有"政治代表权"——因为第一等级、第二等级和第三等级总共只有一票，尽管第三等级占人口的98%。#* +
第一等级和第二等级总是联合起来，因为当然了，神职人员和贵族想要维持他们的社会地位和政治权力。 +
所以，社会等级制度中, 一直存在着社会、政治和经济方面的不平等，再加上饥荒，哇，这真是一场革命的成熟时机。 +

*法国大革命本身分为两个阶段：自由或温和阶段, 以及激进阶段。* +

受到启蒙运动和《独立宣言》（Declaration of Independence）的启发，*法国国民议会*（French National Assembly）起草了《人权和公民权宣言》（Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen）。国民议会非常活跃，因为他们还通过了《教士公民组织法》（Civil Constitution of the Clergy），将法国划分为多个地区，并废除了封建特权。 +
他们真的**试图废除法国的旧制度（Ancien Régime），而且他们确实做到了——他们制定了1791年宪法，并迫使路易十六签署。** +

天哪，*国民议会在革命的头三年, 做了很多事情。#但是后来，外部势力试图干涉法国的局势——特别是奥地利和普鲁士#*——因为毕竟玛丽·安托瓦内特（Marie Antoinette）是奥地利人。 +
*#然后法国向他们宣战，接着一切都陷入了混乱。#* +

让 - 保罗·马拉（Jean-Paul Marat）开始撰写《人民之友》（L'Ami du Peuple），这真的激励人们走向激进。**1793年——在签署宪法两年后——路易十六因叛国罪受审，然后被断头台处决。 **+
提醒一下同学们，在AP欧洲历史中，这不是我们第一次看到弑君事件，因为我们可以追溯到英国内战时期查理一世（Charles I）被斩首的事件。 +

*#随着路易十六被斩首，革命进入了激进阶段。罗伯斯庇尔和他的雅各宾派（Jacobin faction）让法国进入了恐怖统治时期#（Reign of Terror），成千上万的革命敌人被送上断头台。* +

但我得说, 罗伯斯庇尔做了两件值得注意的事情。第一，他让法国采用了公制，这很有用，美国也应该采用。第二，他制定了《最高限价法》（Laws of the Maximum），规定了粮食的最高售价。 +

为了消除旧制度的所有痕迹，雅克 - 勒内·埃贝尔（Jacques-René Hébert）推行了"去基督教化"运动，试图消除法国基督教的所有痕迹, 以及天主教会的影响。 +
这导致了一个新历法系统的诞生，一周有十天。同时，巴黎圣母院（Notre-Dame）变成了理性圣殿，"自然神论"的至上崇拜（Cult of the Supreme Being）兴起。 +

说到至上崇拜，**罗伯斯庇尔**表现得好像他可能是这个新崇拜的领袖或神明，所以最终在1794年他也被斩首了。 +
*他的死亡, 结束了恐怖统治，也导致了一个由五人组成的"督政府"（Directory）的兴起，他们统治着法国，直到后来拿破仑发动了政变。* +

在介绍了法国大革命的基本情况后，我还需要讲两件事：大规模征兵, 和女性的参与。 +

还记得我说过**普鲁士和奥地利向法国宣战**吗？是的，*法国决定反击，通过大规模征兵（levée en masse）组建军队，不仅要对抗普鲁士和奥地利，还要对抗欧洲其他地方存在的旧制度的残余势力。* +
受到革命的鼓舞和动员，**这些士兵想要把他们在法国带来的变革, 推广到欧洲其他地方。**而且，*一位名叫拿破仑的将军, 在意大利赢得了一些非常重要的战役。* +

最后，让我们以女性在法国大革命中的参与,来结束。因为她们在其中发挥了很大的作用。这是我们开始看到女性成为故事主角的时期。 +
在《人权和公民权宣言》签署后，巴黎的卖鱼女（poissardes）们, 不相信路易国王和玛丽·安托瓦内特会真正遵守宣言，所以在当年10月，她们向凡尔赛宫进军，迫使路易国王和玛丽·安托瓦内特搬回巴黎，而不是待在城外，以便对他们进行监视。 +

受到《人权和公民权宣言》（我亲切地称它为DRMC）的启发，奥林普·德·古热（Olympe de Gouges）撰写了《妇女和女公民权利宣言》（Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen）。 +

**所以，受到启蒙运动启发的女性，在很大程度上和男性一样，成为了这场革命的积极参与者。**虽然这看起来很棒，而且她们为获得更多法律特权而斗争，但在路易十六死后共和国成立时，公民身份很快就只限于男性了。 +
她们想要改善旧制度的一些方面，但不是所有方面。 +

虽然我说过, 我只会讲大家绝对需要知道的内容，但我想以玛丽·安托瓦内特的正义问题, 来结束这个视频，因为大家——哦，她在历史上受到了很不公正的对待，这是不应该的。 +
她14岁就嫁给了路易十六，然后她继承了法国的所有问题，也继承了法国的所有财富。如果你是一个14岁的女孩，突然拥有了你能想象到的最多的财富，你会怎么做呢？当然是花掉它。 +
而且她的丈夫在7年里都没有和她圆房，这可能让她处于非常糟糕的境地，因为作为王后，她的一项职责是生下一个儿子，但她还没有做到，因为她的丈夫根本不愿意这么做。 +
更不用说大家都把问题归咎于玛丽这件事了。这不是玛丽的错。这是路易十六的错。他是个非常糟糕的国王。 +
甚至从他们死亡的不同情况来看：玛丽被装在一辆敞篷马车上被推上断头台，这意味着在她被处决的时候——在她丈夫去世8个月后——一直被人嘲笑，还被扔东西。 +

我可以继续说下去，但我想让这个视频保持简短。所以，同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。而且永远不要忘记：为玛丽讨回正义。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 5.4: The French Revolution.

Now here's the deal. I bet your teacher did a phenomenal job covering the French Revolution because it's everyone's favorite revolution. The chaos, the bloodshed, Robespierre, the guillotine -- I mean, it's stunning to study.

Because of that, I'm going to keep this video short, sweet, and to the point about exactly what you need to know based on the course exam description from the AP European History test. And if you're taking notes, let's break this up into causes, major events, and effects.

Got long-term political and social causes and short-term economic causes. Let's break this down.

Socially, the Third Estate in France -- the bottom of that social hierarchy that made up 98% of the population -- was having a real rough go. They paid all of the taxes, and there also happened to be a famine, and bread prices were increasing drastically, which means that they were now not only poor but also hangry.

Politically, if you remember in the 1700s, Louis XIV had fought disastrous wars that threw France into debt, and then France helped support the colonists fight against the British in the American Revolution. And then the peasants were like, "Hey, this doesn't make any sense. If you are funding other people's wars but you're not giving us money, and there's a bread shortage, what are we going to do?"

Inspired by Enlightenment philosophers, the Third Estate also desired more political representation -- of which they had almost none -- because the First Estate, the Second Estate, and the Third Estate all had one vote total, even though that Third Estate made up 98% of the population.

And the First Estate and the Second Estate always wanted to work together because, of course, the clergy and the nobility want to keep their social status and political power.

So there has been a history of social, political, and economic disparities among the estate system, and then you know, throw famine into the mix, and wow, it is a ripe time for a revolution.

The revolution itself existed in two phases: the liberal or moderate phase and the radical phase.

Inspired by the Enlightenment and also the Declaration of Independence, the French National Assembly wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. That National Assembly was very active because they also passed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, they divided France into districts, and they abolished feudal privileges.

They were really trying to get rid of that old Ancien Régime in France, and boy did they -- with writing a constitution of 1791 that they then forced King Louis XVI to sign.

Man, that National Assembly got a lot done in the first three years of the revolution. But then, outside forces try to get involved in what's going on in France -- specifically Austria and Prussia -- because you know, Marie Antoinette was Austrian after all.

And then France declares war on them, and then everything just descends into chaos.

After Jean-Paul Marat starts writing L'Ami du Peuple, which really inspires people to turn radical, 1793 -- two years after he signed the constitution -- King Louis XVI was put on trial for treason and then was beheaded by a guillotine.

Just a reminder, students, this is not the first time that we have seen regicide in AP Euro because we always got to look back way back to the English Civil War with the beheading of Charles I.

With the beheading of Louis XVI, the revolution enters into its radical phase. Robespierre and his Jacobin faction enter France into the Reign of Terror, in which thousands of people who are enemies of the revolution are guillotined.

But I will give Robespierre this: during his leadership, he did two notable things.

His death ends the Reign of Terror and also leads to the rise of a five-man Directory who rules over France until eventually Napoleon throws a coup d'état.
