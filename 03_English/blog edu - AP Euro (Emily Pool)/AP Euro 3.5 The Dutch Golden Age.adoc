嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。咱们来聊聊主题3.5：荷兰黄金时代（the Dutch Golden Age）。 +

如今，*#在这个"专制主义"和"立宪主义"的时代，荷兰共和国（Dutch Republic）是一个显著的例外，因为他们既不受绝对君主制的统治，也不受君主立宪制的统治。相反，他们由一群本质上是商人精英的寡头统治。#* +

**在16世纪和17世纪，荷兰人在技术层面上属于"哈布斯堡帝国"（Habsburg Empire）的一部分，但在三十年战争（Thirty Years' War）以及随后的《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia）之后，#荷兰人得以从西班牙"哈布斯堡家族"（Spanish Habsburgs）的统治下独立出来。#**以前，他们被称为尼德兰联合省共和国（Republic of the United Provinces of the Netherlands）。 +

同学们，如果你们还没有建立起这个联系——你们知道我们在第一单元讨论过"北方文艺复兴"（Northern Renaissance）传播到"低地国家"（Low Countries）的情况吧？荷兰，也就是低地国家——天哪——总共有七个省。 +

*与西欧其他地区, 以及那些"传统的土地贵族和贵族阶层"形成对比的是，##荷兰共和国主要由那些新的"精英阶层——商人精英"——组成，##他们想要确保自己在欧洲的经济地位，顺便说一下，由于荷兰东印度公司（Dutch East India Company）的存在，他们的经济地位比其他所有人都要高得多。* +

*#他们建立了一个寡头统治。寡头统治是由一群人来统治，在"荷兰共和国"进行统治的这群人, 是富有的商人 (荷兰是商人治国, 而非君主治国,贵族治国)。来自各省的富有商人代表组成的"三级会议"（Estates General）, 负责任命"执政"（stadholders）#*。 +

现在，这些"执政"是军事领袖。在冲突时期，他们负责保卫特定的省份，但他们也是名义上的领袖——会出席所有礼仪活动的人。你们知道其中一位执政，他就是威廉二世（William II），也就是奥兰治的威廉（William of Orange），就是那个后来在本单元成为英格兰国王的威廉（William）和玛丽（Mary）中的威廉。 +

**"荷兰共和国"确实是个例外——"波兰立陶宛联邦"（Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth）也是个例外，**不过AP考试并不关注波兰立陶宛联邦，尽管我对此很关注。 +

不管怎样，*#荷兰共和国和这些联合省, 是一种权力分散的形式。与权力集中在一个人手中的"中央集权君主制"不同，在荷兰共和国，权力是分散的——权力分散在各个领袖手中，但他们会共同合作。#* +
*这个寡头统治——在"联合省"分享权力的这群人——主要是为了促进和保护贸易而存在。* +

**#荷兰在这个时期,与西欧其他地区相比，还有一个显著的例外，那就是他们认识到"宗教宽容"的重要性，并允许积极的"宗教多元主义"。#**路易十四（Louis XIV）通过《枫丹白露敕令》（Edict of Fontainebleau）规定，如果你要待在法国，就必须是天主教徒，这迫使数十万胡格诺派（Huguenots）教徒逃离法国，他们前往普鲁士（Prussia）和荷兰共和国。 +

这些胡格诺派——这些法国"加尔文主义者"——非常符合**"荷兰共和国"的"新教"工作伦理观念：如果你努力工作，上帝会用金钱上的收益来回报你。** +

那么荷兰人用他们的财富做了什么呢？嗯，你们知道的，他们委托创作了了不起的艺术作品。**我们称这个时期为"荷兰黄金时代"**是有原因的——黄金时代：一个非常美好的时期，一个经济繁荣的时期，而且通常是一个与艺术创新蓬勃发展相关的时期。 +
如果你看看维米尔（Vermeer）——这个时期最著名的荷兰艺术家——以及他的画作，我的意思是，他的画作描绘的是荷兰共和国的商人。 +

如果你纵观历史的大叙事，很容易理解事情发展的总体趋势，但关注那些特殊情况也很重要。是的，西欧正经历着"绝对君主"的崛起，但你需要关注那些差异——那些例外情况，如果你愿意，可以把荷兰比作西欧的蒙古人（这里指**荷兰是西欧中, 与众不同的存在**）。 +

同学们，一如既往，如果你在AP课程的技能方面或者总体内容方面有困难，一定要查看我下面链接的终极复习资料包，因为它会为你提供你在课堂上以及AP考试中取得最大成功所需的一切。 +
同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 3.5: the Dutch Golden Age.

Now, in this age of absolutism and constitutionalism, the Dutch Republic stands as a notable exception because they are neither governed by an absolute monarchy nor a constitutional monarchy. Rather, they are governed by an oligarchy of essentially merchant elites.

The Dutch of the 1500s and the 1600s were technically part of the Habsburg Empire, but after the Thirty Years' War and the subsequent Peace of Westphalia, the Dutch were able to become independent from the Spanish Habsburgs. Formerly, they are known as the Republic of the United Provinces of the Netherlands.

And students, if we have not yet made this connection -- you know how we talked about in unit one as the Northern Renaissance is spreading to the Low Countries? The Netherlands, the Low Countries -- oh my gosh -- there are seven provinces total.

And in contrast to the rest of Western Europe and those traditional landed elites and aristocracies, the Dutch Republic was mainly comprised of those new elites -- the merchant elites -- wanting to make sure that they are preserving their economic standing in Europe, which by the way is like, you know, extremely higher than everyone else's because the Dutch East India Company.

They create an oligarchy. An oligarchy is ruled by a group of people, and the group of people who are ruling in the Dutch Republic are wealthy merchants. This Estates General of wealthy merchant representatives from the provinces were then responsible for naming stadholders.

Now, these stadholders were military leaders. They were responsible for defense of the specific provinces in times of conflict, but they also served as the figurehead -- the person that showed up to all the ceremonial events. And you know one of these stadholders because he is William II, aka William of Orange, aka William of William and Mary, who then became, you know, King of England in this unit.

The Dutch Republic really is the exception to the rule -- also with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but the AP test doesn't care about that even though I do.

Anyway, the Dutch Republic and these United Provinces are a decentralized form of power. Unlike centralized monarchy where power is concentrated in the hands of one person, in the Dutch Republic it is decentralized -- it is spread out among these various leaders, but they all work together.

And this oligarchy -- this group of people that is sharing power in the United Provinces -- are mainly existing to promote and protect trade.

The Dutch also stand as a notable exception to the rest of Western Europe at this time because they recognize the importance of religious toleration and allow for active religious pluralism. Louis XIV, with his passing of the Edict of Fontainebleau, says if you're going to be in France, you're going to be Catholic, which forces hundreds of thousands of Huguenots to flee, and they go to Prussia and the Dutch Republic.

And these Huguenots -- these French Calvinists -- fit right into the Dutch Republic in that idea of the Protestant work ethic: if you work very hard, God will reward you with monetary gain.

And what did the Dutch do with all their wealth? Well, you know, they commission fantastic works of art. We call this the Dutch Golden Age for a reason -- Golden Age: a really good time, a time of economic prosperity, and often times a time that is associated with a flourishing of artistic innovation.

If you look at Vermeer -- the most famous Dutch artist during this time -- and you look at his paintings, I mean they are about the merchants in the Dutch Republic.

If you look at the big narrative of history, it's easy to understand the general flow of how things are going, but it's important to pay attention to the caveats. Yes, Western Europe is experiencing the rise of absolute monarchs, but you need to pay attention to the differences -- the exceptions, the exceptions to the rule, the Mongols of Western Europe if you will.

And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.
