Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk all about absolutist approaches to power 专制主义的权力行使方式. +

Absolutism 专制主义 is a governmental system 政府体制 where one person has absolute power 绝对权力. Let's not overthink this. It is concomitant with 与…相伴；伴随 -- it often goes hand in hand with 与…紧密相连 -- this idea of Divine Right 君权神授, which says that "I am on the throne 王位；宝座 because God has placed me on the throne." +

Supported by 受…支持 writers like Bossuet, this idea of Divine Right 君权神授 justifies 证明…有理 leaders' right to rule 统治权. But absolutists 专制主义者 can't just do whatever they want to. There are actually four specific ways that they gain and consolidate 巩固 their power. +

Number one is that they often regulate 管制；控制 religion. If we're looking at Louis XIV 路易十四, Louis the 14th said "one king, one law, one faith 信仰". He revokes 废除 the Edict of Nantes 南特敕令 and replaces it with the Edict of Fontainebleau 枫丹白露敕令, which says that if you are going to be French, you are going to be Catholic 天主教徒. This then leads hundreds of thousands of Huguenots 胡格诺派教徒 to flee 逃离 France to go to more Protestant-friendly 对新教徒友好的 lands like Prussia 普鲁士 or like the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国. +

Number two: absolute monarchs 专制君主 actually have to cooperate with 与…合作 the nobility 贵族 because they realize that the nobility are the people who are keeping them in power 掌权. And in order to stay in power 掌权, you need to make sure that you have those people on your side 支持你. +

Louis XIV hosted 举办 lavish parties 奢华派对 at Versailles 凡尔赛宫 and made a ton of 大量的 fun, fashionable changes -- yes, in order to keep an eye on 监视 the nobility to make sure that they wouldn't overthrow 推翻 him again (that's going back to the idea that he had to contend with 应对；处理 the Fronde 投石党运动 in his youth), but also to make sure that they were happy and that they were placated 安抚. Because if the nobility is mad, they're going to want to do something about it against the monarch 君主. +

This is maybe the most important thing that absolutists 专制主义者 did in order to keep their power: they are limiting the nobility's participation in government 参与政府事务, but they are supporting those aristocratic 贵族的 social and economic privileges 特权. +

Number three: they established 建立 permanent armies 常备军. These are now standing armies 常备军 that can exist for the benefit of the state 为国家利益 -- like to quell 平息 internal conflict 内部冲突 -- but also to then maybe conquer 征服 nearby lands or with like a little show of force 展示武力 be like, "Hey Europe, I'm a state worth contending with 值得重视的国家." +

And number four: in some cases 在某些情况下, these monarchs 君主 utilized 利用 secret police forces 秘密警察部队. Looking at you, Ivan, in Russia. +

Now, the AP test actually only wants you to know about two of these absolute monarchs 专制君主 in this topic, and they are Louis XIV 路易十四 and Peter I 彼得一世. +

Louis XIV -- we all love him so much -- but you know who doesn't always get enough credit for 因…得到足够认可 supporting that lifestyle? His finance minister 财政大臣, Jean-Baptiste Colbert. +

Jean-Baptiste Colbert says, "If it can be made in France, make it in France." He's limiting imports 进口 from other countries in order to maximize exports 出口 from France. And Louis and Jean-Baptiste Colbert together spend a lot of their time developing fashion 时尚 -- which I love, because let's just consider the fact that Louis, at his heart in his inner core 内心深处, was a ballet kid, a theater kid. +

And then what does he do in his adult life? He popularizes 推广 French fashion so that still today, in this year, France is the fashion capital of the world. Jean-Baptiste Colbert was the guy who came up with the idea of "we need a summer wardrobe 衣柜 and we need a winter wardrobe." And Louis took this idea of local handmade French things so far that when he saw his son wearing a wool coat from England, he ordered him to burn it. +

So while Louis is ascending 提升 his nobility and aristocratic class 贵族阶级 up here with fancy fashion 华丽时尚 and fancy parties 奢华派对, the rest of the Third Estate 第三等级 -- not doing great. But that will become more important next unit. +

So Jean-Baptiste Colbert comes up with 想出 brilliant ways to make France as much money as possible. But here's the problem: the more money that Colbert brings in, the more money that Louis spends on wars that he tends to lose. +

I got to say, even though the Dutch Revolt 荷兰起义 and the Nine Years' War 九年战争 cost a lot of money, Louis still has so much because Versailles cost $2 billion in today's money to build. Just a reminder: Versailles 凡尔赛宫 is a monumental 宏伟的；不朽的 work of architecture 建筑作品 that shows off 展示 the glories 辉煌 and the splendor 壮丽 and the wealth 财富 of France under Louis the 14th. +

So that is us looking at absolutism 专制主义 in the west. But now let's look at absolutism 专制主义 in the east under Peter I 彼得一世. +

Peter the first 彼得一世 is sometimes called Peter the Great 彼得大帝. And students, I personally as a teacher hate to talk about leaders as "the great" or "the terrible," and here is why: history exists in the gray area 灰色地带. If we see things as good or bad or great or terrible, then we tend to only view them through that lens 视角. +

If I'm telling you that Peter is "the great" -- and "great" as a connotation 内涵 is good in our society -- then you're only going to see the good things that Peter did and not the bad things that he did. People are good and bad, not good or bad. +

Peter the first became leader in Russia in the mid-1600s and saw that Russia was really far behind its contemporaneous 同时代的 European counterparts 欧洲国家. Also, that he spent a lot of his time traveling to Western Europe in his youth, and he noticed, "Wow, look at these ships, look at these modern cities, look at all these people who are dressed very fancily." +

And when he becomes the sole tsar 沙皇 of Russia, he takes it upon himself to westernize 使西方化 this backwoods country 落后的国家. +

Politically 政治上, he builds his new capital, St. Petersburg 圣彼得堡, which he calls his "window on the west" 面向西方的窗口 -- yes, because it is a warm-water port 不冻港 that kind of overlooks Western Europe, but also because he modeled the city after France 仿照法国建造城市. +

Speaking of a new warm-water port, Peter builds a navy from scratch 从零开始组建海军 and then also reinvigorates 重振 the Russian military 俄罗斯军队 by creating a table of ranks 军衔制度, which means that people are going to be promoted 晋升 based on how good they are at their job, not based on who their parents are. We call this a meritocracy 精英管理制度, and Peter brought it to Russia. +

Fancy new army and navy, he defeats Sweden in the Great Northern War 大北方战争, which officially declares Russia a contender 竞争者 on the European stage 欧洲舞台. +

Tax and trade reforms 税收和贸易改革 in Russia expand the treasury 国库 sixfold 六倍 in 50 years. He recognizes the importance of education 教育, and Peter the first establishes 建立 the Russian Academy of Sciences 俄罗斯科学院 and also requires the boyars 波雅尔（俄罗斯贵族） -- the nobility in Russia -- to send their kids to Western Europe to be educated. +

Now you might be thinking, "Emily, all those things are so good. Of course Peter I deserves to be called 'the great.'" Well, just think about that's also because we are in the west, so we kind of like Western things. +

But in his change -- his total change of Russian society -- he dismantles 废除；瓦解 traditional Russian or Slavic customs and traditions 俄罗斯或斯拉夫的习俗和传统. In forcing the nobles to dress like Western Europeans, he removes the Slavic culture of the bare-skin capes 光皮披风 and the furry hats 毛皮帽子. +

In building St. Petersburg 圣彼得堡, he drains a swamp 排干沼泽 and then leads to the deaths of hundreds of people. And then also forces peasants 农民 to do all the work for him. And if you have not heard about the beard tax 胡须税, just ask your teacher. +

The CED -- the course exam description 课程考试说明 -- wants me to throw in 补充说明 the fact right here that Catherine the Great 叶卡捷琳娜大帝, Catherine II of Russia 俄罗斯的叶卡捷琳娜二世, continues this westernization 西方化进程. So I'm going to tell you that now, but then we'll put a pin in that 先记住这个点 because we're going to get to her way later in the course. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。咱们来全面聊聊"专制主义"的权力手段。 +

**专制主义是一种政府体制，在这种体制下，一个人拥有绝对权力。**我们不要过度思考这个概念。它与 “君权神授（Divine Right）” 的观念相伴相生，“君权神授” 即 “我能登上王位, 是因为上帝让我登上王位”。 +
这种"君权神授"的观念, 得到了像波舒哀（Bossuet）这样的作家的支持，它为统治者的统治权提供了正当理由。*但"专制主义者"不能为所欲为。实际上，他们通过四种特定方式, 来获取和巩固权力。* +

**第一点是: 他们常常对宗教进行管控。**以路易十四（Louis XIV）为例，*路易十四说 “一个国王，一部法律，一种信仰”。他废除了《南特敕令（Edict of Nantes）》，代之以《枫丹白露敕令（Edict of Fontainebleau）》，该敕令规定，如果你是法国人，你就得是天主教徒。这导致数十万胡格诺派（Huguenots）教徒逃离法国，前往像普鲁士（Prussia）或荷兰共和国（Dutch Republic）这样对新教徒更友好的地方。* +

**第二点："绝对君主"实际上必须与贵族合作，**因为他们意识到, 贵族是让他们维持统治的人。为了继续掌权，你需要确保这些人站在你这边。 +

**路易十四在凡尔赛宫（Versailles）举办奢华的派对，**进行了许多有趣且时尚的变革——没错，*一方面是为了监视贵族，确保他们不会再次推翻他*（这又回到了他年轻时不得不应对"投石党运动"（Fronde）的情况），*但也是为了确保贵族们开心并得到安抚。因为如果贵族们生气了，他们就会想对君主采取行动。* +

这可能是"专制主义者"为了维护权力所做的最重要的事情：*#他们限制贵族参与政府事务，但同时支持贵族的社会和经济特权。(把你养起来, 但在政治权力上不与你分享权力)#* +

**第三点：他们建立了常备军。**这些常备军存在的意义是为了国家的利益——比如平息内部冲突——但也可能是为了征服附近的土地，或者展示武力，意思是 “嘿，欧洲，我是一个不容小觑的国家”。 +

**第四点：**在某些情况下，**这些君主会利用秘密警察部队。**俄罗斯的伊凡（Ivan）就是这样。 +

现在，AP考试实际上只要求你们了解这个主题中的**两位"绝对君主"，他们是路易十四和彼得一世（Peter I）。(学习就是了解该类型的典型案例和典型人物, 而不需要知道所有的相关类型的人) ** +

路易十四——我们都很喜欢他——但你们知道吗，他那种奢华生活背后默默付出的人, 却没有得到应有的认可，这个人就是**他的财政大臣让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔**（Jean-Baptiste Colbert）。 +
让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔**说：“如果能在法国制造，就在法国制造。” 他限制从其他国家的进口，以实现法国出口的最大化。**路易十四和让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔一起花了很多时间发展时尚——我很喜欢这一点，因为想想看，从本质上来说，路易十四内心就是一个喜欢芭蕾和戏剧的人。 +

那么他成年后做了什么呢？他推广法国时尚，以至于直到今天，法国仍然是世界时尚之都。让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔提出了 “我们需要夏装和冬装” 的理念。路易十四将这种推崇法国本土手工制品的理念, 发挥到了极致，当他看到他的儿子穿着一件来自英国的羊毛外套时，他下令把外套烧掉。 +

所以，**当路易十四用奢华的时尚和派对, 来提升贵族和贵族阶级的地位时，第三等级（Third Estate）的其他人——情况就不太妙了。**但这一点在下一单元会变得更加重要。 +

所以让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔想出了绝妙的办法, 让法国尽可能多地赚钱。但问题是：柯尔贝尔带来的钱越多，路易十四花在战争上的钱也越多，而且他还老是打败仗。 +

我得说，尽管荷兰起义（Dutch Revolt）和九年战争（Nine Years' War）耗费了大量资金，但路易十四仍然很富有，因为建造凡尔赛宫花了相当于今天20亿美元的资金。提醒一下：凡尔赛宫是一座不朽的建筑杰作，展示了路易十四统治下法国的辉煌、壮丽和财富。 +

以上就是我们对"西方专制主义"的探讨。但现在让我们看看彼得一世统治下东方的专制主义。 +

*彼得一世有时被称为彼得大帝*（Peter the Great）。同学们，作为一名教师，*#我个人不喜欢用 “伟大” 或 “糟糕” 来形容领导者，原因如下：历史存在于灰色地带。如果我们把事情简单地看作是好或坏、伟大或糟糕，那么我们往往只会从单一的视角来看待它们。#* +
*如果我告诉你们彼得是 “伟大的”——“伟大” 在我们的社会中有积极的内涵——那么你们只会看到彼得做的好事，而看不到他做的坏事。人(人性)是好坏参半的，而不是单纯的好或坏。* +

彼得一世在17世纪中期成为俄罗斯的领导者，他看到俄罗斯远远落后于同时期的欧洲其他国家。而且，他年轻时花了很多时间游历西欧，他注意到，“哇，看看这些船只，看看这些现代化的城市，看看这些穿着非常华丽的人”。 +
当他成为俄罗斯唯一的沙皇时，他承担起了让这个落后国家西方化的责任。 +

在政治方面，*他建造了新首都"圣彼得堡"（St. Petersburg），他称其为他的 “西方之窗”——是的，因为这是一个可以俯瞰西欧的温水港，而且还因为他以法国为蓝本建造了这座城市。* +

说到新的温水港，彼得一世从零开始建立了一支海军，并且通过制定官阶表, 重振了俄罗斯军队，这意味着人们将**根据他们的工作能力得到晋升，而不是根据他们的出身。我们称这为"任人唯贤制"（meritocracy），**是彼得把它带到了俄罗斯。 +
拥有了华丽的新军和海军，*他在"大北方战争"（Great Northern War）中打败了瑞典，这正式宣告俄罗斯成为欧洲舞台上的有力竞争者。* +

俄罗斯的税收和贸易改革, 在50年内使国库收入增加了六倍。**他认识到教育的重要性，彼得一世建立了俄罗斯科学院（Russian Academy of Sciences），并且要求波雅尔（boyars，俄罗斯的贵族）把他们的孩子送到西欧接受教育。** +

现在你们可能会想，“艾米丽，这些事情都很棒。当然彼得一世配得上被称为 ‘大帝’。” 嗯，要知道这也是因为我们站在西方的视角，所以我们有点喜欢西方的东西。 +

但在他对俄罗斯社会的变革中——他对俄罗斯社会进行了彻底的变革——**他废除了传统的俄罗斯或斯拉夫（Slavic）习俗和传统。在强迫贵族们穿得像西欧人时，**他摒弃了斯拉夫文化中裸露的披风以及毛皮帽子。 +
在建造圣彼得堡时，他排干了沼泽，导致数百人死亡。并且还强迫农民为他做所有的工作。如果你们没听说过胡须税（beard tax），可以问问你们的老师。 +

课程考试描述（CED，Course Exam Description）要求我在这里提到，**俄罗斯的叶卡捷琳娜大帝（Catherine the Great，Catherine II）延续了这种西方化。**所以我现在告诉你们，但我们先记住这一点，因为在课程后面我们还会讲到她。 +

如果你们在比较和对比"绝对君主"方面需要帮助，一定要查看我在下面描述中链接的终极复习资料包，因为我提供了你们在技能练习、知识学习方面所需的一切，能帮助你们在AP课程和AP考试中取得成功。 +
同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +
