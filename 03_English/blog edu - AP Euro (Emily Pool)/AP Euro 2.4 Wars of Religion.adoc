Hey students, it's Emily P, and it's time to talk about the wars of religion 宗教战争. Now we have a lot to discuss in this video, so buckle up 做好准备. Let's do this.
 +
With the onset 开始；开端 of the Protestant Reformation 新教改革, people start grappling at 努力争取 their own political control 政治控制权 to try to take away power from the Catholic Church 天主教会. Yes, this is also sometimes genuinely 真正地 rooted in 源于 religious devotion 宗教信仰 and in people believing that the Catholic Church was corrupt 腐败的 and had corrupted the faith. But also, a lot of time there was like a political aspect 政治因素 to it of leaders trying to amass 积累 more power -- or as the AP Euro says, "States exploited 利用 religious conflicts 宗教冲突 to promote 促进 political and economic interests 政治和经济利益."
 +
We're only going to talk about two things in this video: the French Wars of Religion 法国宗教战争 and the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争. So let's start with my favorite, the French Wars of Religion.
 +
You know how you inevitably 不可避免地 stumble upon 偶然发现 someone in your study of history and you're like, "Oh, that person is my person"? You know, Caesar loved Alexander. I love Catherine de' Medici. She was responsible for 对……负责 bringing so many fantastic cultural advancements 文化进步 to France when she lived in France, then became the queen of France. I mean, forks 餐叉, ballet 芭蕾舞, the Valois tapestries 瓦卢瓦挂毯, she built the Tuileries 杜伊勒里宫 -- we love Catherine de' Medici.
 +
She is often looked at unfavorably 不利地；负面地 in history, which I absolutely disagree with because I actually think she's a great example of a politique 政治家 -- or someone who puts political stability 政治稳定 above religious orthodoxy 宗教正统观念. She says making sure that we are all politically stable is actually more important than making sure that we all follow the same religion.
 +
Let's talk about these French Wars of Religion. Catherine de' Medici was the queen of France, and her husband Henry II died because of injuries sustained 遭受 in a jousting accident 骑士比武事故. There's a lot going on with him and his affairs 风流韵事 and how Catherine dealt with all of that, but they ultimately 最终 had 10 children together.
 +
When Henry II died, three French families emerged 出现 and started to fight for power, and I will greatly summarize 总结 this for you. There is the Guise family -- they are ultra-Catholic 极端天主教徒. There is the Bourbon family -- they are Protestant 新教徒. And there's the Valois family, which is where Catherine came from and where Henry came from, and they are in the middle. They are Catholic, but they also again aren't ultra-Catholic, not Protestant, but they just want to maintain the peace 维持和平.
 +
Think about it like, you know, a Goldilocks moment 刚刚好的时刻 -- too hot, too cold, just right. And ultimately, there's a son from each of these families that all fight each other, and their names are all Henry, so this war is sometimes called the War of the Three Henrys 三亨利之战.
 +
There's a bunch of conflicts 冲突 between all of them, but Catherine de' Medici ends up 最终 marrying her daughter to Henry of Navarre, who eventually becomes king and is Henry IV. This new Protestant -- question mark -- King of France, Henry IV, when he becomes king says, "Uh, you know, we just fought like for a bunch of decades 数十年 over Protestantism versus Catholicism. Let me just pass this thing called the Edict of Nantes 南特敕令."
 +
The Edict of Nantes brings religious pluralism 宗教多元主义 into France, which means that two religions can coexist 共存 at the same time. It's okay to be Protestant as long as you're not practicing Protestantism in Paris.
 +
Of all of those wars, by the way, Henry IV, now King of France, says, "Paris is worth a mass 巴黎值得一场弥撒," and even though he was raised Protestant and fought for the Protestants, converts to 改信 Catholicism in order to maintain domestic peace 维持国内和平, in order to prevent future wars.
 +
The Edict of Nantes says, "Yeah, you can practice what you want." Idea of religious pluralism we already know exists in Germany after the Peace of Augsburg 奥格斯堡和约, and now it is happening in France. But it does not last in France.
 +
Shortly after that ends, in 1618 in Central Europe, the Thirty Years' War breaks out 爆发. An easy way to think about this is that Habsburg rulers 哈布斯堡王朝统治者 -- if they can trace their roots back to 追溯到 the Habsburg family -- are Catholic, and non-Habsburg rulers are Protestants.
 +
And part of the reason that people convert to 改信 Protestantism is because they want to weaken 削弱 the power that the Habsburg family has on Europe. From 1618 to 1648, the Thirty Years' War wages 进行 in Central Europe, and approximately 大约 6 million people die.
 +
It starts out with genuine religious devotion 虔诚的宗教信仰, but as more outside states like Sweden get involved in 卷入 this conflict, it turns increasingly 越来越多地 political. What you need to know about the Thirty Years' War is that it ends with the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约 in 1648, which is also the end marker date 结束标志日期 for the first time period in AP European History.
 +
The Peace of Westphalia ends the Thirty Years' War, but it also establishes 确立 the idea of national self-determination 民族自决, which means that you as a leader should be able to decide what religion you want the people within your lands to practice.
 +
This also cements 巩固 the end of the idea of a universal Christendom 普世基督教世界 still existing in Europe. It recognizes 承认 that there are going to be Catholics and there are going to be Protestants. It is different than the Edict of Nantes because the Edict of Nantes says within the same state you can practice different faiths 信仰, whereas 然而 the Peace of Westphalia says that you as the leader of your small Germanic state 日耳曼国家, for example, can determine the religion that will be in your state.
 +
Religious pluralism at this time exists in France, the Netherlands -- AKA 又名 the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国 -- and also in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 波兰立陶宛联邦, which hopefully you remember from last video.
 +
Let's wrap up 总结 this video by talking about the oft-neglected 经常被忽视的 European empire in AP Euro: the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国.
 +
In the 1600s, the Ottoman Empire looked at what was happening in Europe and thought, "Huh, this is right. Time for the conquering 征服. They were just plagued with 饱受……困扰 wars. I bet they're going to be weakened enough for us to now take over 接管."
 +
The Ottoman Empire starts to expand westward 向西扩张 and is ultimately 最终 stopped at the Siege of Vienna 维也纳之围 in 1683, shortly after the Peace of Westphalia. And that marks 标志着 the last significant time that the Ottoman Empire tries to take over a land in Eastern Europe.
 +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P，现在是时候聊聊宗教战争了。在这个视频里我们有很多内容要讨论，所以系好安全带。我们开始吧。 +

*##随着新教改革的开始，人们开始争夺政治控制权，试图从天主教会手中夺取权力。##没错，这有时也真正源于宗教信仰，源于人们认为天主教会腐败且败坏了信仰。#但同时，很多时候这也有政治方面的因素，领导者们试图积累更多权力#*——或者就像AP欧洲历史课程里说的，“#*各国利用宗教冲突来促进政治和经济利益*#”。 +

在这个视频里我们只讨论两件事：法国宗教战争（French Wars of Religion）和三十年战争（Thirty Years' War）。所以我们从我的最爱，法国宗教战争开始说起。 +

你知道在学习历史时，不可避免地会遇到某个人，然后你会想，“哦，那个人是我欣赏的人” 吗？你知道，凯撒（Caesar）崇拜亚历山大（Alexander）。我喜欢凯瑟琳·德·美第奇（Catherine de' Medici）。她在法国生活并成为法国王后的时候，为法国带来了许多了不起的文化进步。我的意思是，叉子、芭蕾舞、瓦卢瓦挂毯，她还建造了杜伊勒里宫——我们喜欢凯瑟琳·德·美第奇。 +

在历史上她常常受到负面评价，我完全不同意这种看法，因为实际上我认为她是 “政治家” 的一个很好的例子——或者说**她是那种把"政治稳定"置于"宗教正统"之上的人。她说，确保我们在政治上的稳定, 实际上比确保我们都信仰同一宗教更重要。** +

我们来谈谈这些法国宗教战争。凯瑟琳·德·美第奇是法国王后，她的丈夫亨利二世（Henry II）在一场马上比武事故中受伤身亡。关于他的那些风流韵事, 以及凯瑟琳如何处理这些事情, 有很多故事，但他们最终一共有10个孩子。 +

**亨利二世去世后，三个法国家族崛起并开始争夺权力，**我简单给你们总结一下。有吉斯家族（Guise family）——他们是极端的天主教徒。有波旁家族（Bourbon family）——他们是新教徒。还有瓦卢瓦家族（Valois family），凯瑟琳和亨利就来自这个家族，他们处于中间立场。他们是天主教徒，但他们又不是极端天主教徒，也不是新教徒，他们只是想维持和平。 +

想象一下，就像 “金发姑娘和三只熊” 那个故事里的情况——太极端、太不极端，恰到好处。最终，这些家族的子嗣相互争斗，而且他们都叫亨利，所以这场战争有时被称为 “三亨利之战”。 +

他们之间发生了很多冲突，但凯瑟琳·德·美第奇最终把她的女儿嫁给了纳瓦拉的亨利（Henry of Navarre），纳瓦拉的亨利最终成为了国王，即亨利四世（Henry IV）。*这位新的（存疑的）法国国王亨利四世，在他成为国王时说，“嗯，你知道，我们为了新教和天主教的问题争斗了几十年。我要通过一项叫《南特敕令》（Edict of Nantes）的法令。*” +

*#《南特敕令》将宗教多元主义引入法国，这意味着两种宗教可以同时存在。当个新教徒没关系，只要你不在巴黎信奉新教就行。#* +

顺便说一下，在所有这些战争之后，法国国王亨利四世说，“巴黎值得一场弥撒”，尽管他在新教环境中长大, 并为新教徒而战，但为了维护国内和平、防止未来的战争，他改信了天主教。 +

#*《南特敕令》说，“是的，你可以践行你想信的宗教”。我们已经知道，"宗教多元主义"的理念在《奥格斯堡和约》之后在德国就存在了，而现在它也在法国出现了。但它在法国并没有持续下去。*# +

*在那之后不久，1618年，中欧爆发了三十年战争。一种简单的理解方式是，哈布斯堡王朝（Habsburg）的统治者们——如果他们能把根源追溯到"哈布斯堡家族"——是天主教徒，而"非哈布斯堡王朝"的统治者们是新教徒。* +

**人们改信"新教"的部分原因, 是他们想削弱哈布斯堡家族在欧洲的权力。**从1618年到1648年，三十年战争在中欧爆发，大约有600万人死亡。 +

**这场战争最初源于真正的宗教信仰，但随着像瑞典（Sweden）这样的外部国家卷入冲突，它越来越具有政治性。**关于三十年战争你需要知道的是，**它以1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia）结束，**而《威斯特伐利亚和约》的签订也标志着AP欧洲历史课程第一个时期的结束。 +

*#《威斯特伐利亚和约》结束了三十年战争，但它也确立了"民族自决"的理念，这意味着作为领导者，你应该能够决定你领土内的人们信仰什么宗教。#* +

*这也巩固了欧洲"普世基督教世界这一理念的终结"。#它承认会有天主教徒和新教徒。这和《南特敕令》不同，因为《南特敕令》说在同一个国家内, 你可以践行不同的信仰，而《威斯特伐利亚和约》说，比如你作为一个日耳曼小邦国的领导者，可以决定你邦国内的宗教信仰 (是统治者决定, 而不是人民自由决定)。#* +

*此时"宗教多元主义"存在于法国、荷兰（荷兰共和国，the Dutch Republic），还有波兰立陶宛联邦*（Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth），希望你们还记得上一个视频里提到的这个国家。 +

让我们通过聊聊在AP欧洲历史课程里常常被忽视的欧洲帝国：奥斯曼帝国（Ottoman Empire），来结束这个视频。 +

*在17世纪，奥斯曼帝国看到欧洲发生的事情后想，“嗯，时机到了，该去征服了。他们正饱受战争困扰。我打赌他们已经被削弱到我们可以接管的程度了。”* +

奥斯曼帝国开始向西扩张，但最终在1683年的维也纳之围（Siege of Vienna）中被阻止，这是在《威斯特伐利亚和约》签订后不久。*这标志着奥斯曼帝国最后一次试图接管东欧土地。* +

如果这些内容让你感到困惑，一定要查看我的终极复习资料包，因为我有大量更深入的资源，能让你深入了解三十年战争和法国宗教战争。 +
同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +
