Hey students, it's Emily P. I'm going to combine topics 3.3 and 3.4 together because they both deal with 处理；涉及 economic development 经济发展, so let's just get right into this. +

We know that unit 3 is absolutism 专制主义 and constitutionalism 立宪主义, and these new absolute monarchs 专制君主 are gaining their power and supporting their wealth through a lot of economic changes 经济变革. But continuities 连续性；延续性 are always easier to talk about, so that's where I'm going to start. +

A continuity 连续性；延续性 is something that stays the same over a given time period 特定时间段, and changes are things that veer off 偏离；改变方向 -- that change during a given time period 特定时间段. This is a key historical thinking skill 关键历史思维技能 that the AP test wants you to know and that you will be tested on 接受测试. +

So if you are struggling with 苦苦应对 skills like comparison 比较, causation 因果关系, or CCOT (Continuity and Change Over Time，历史延续与变迁), make sure that you check out 查看 my Ultimate Review Packet because I have a ton of 大量的 skills prep 技能准备 for you. +

All right, economic continuities 经济延续性 that have continued from the first two units of study: European countries are still gaining an incredible amount of wealth 获得巨额财富 due to 由于 their mercantilist policies 重商主义政策 from their colonies 殖民地 in the New World 新大陆. +

And while that transatlantic slave system 跨大西洋奴隶制度 is ramping up 扩大；增加 in size as more enslaved Africans 被奴役的非洲人 are sent along the Middle Passage 中央航路 to work in sugar plantations 甘蔗种植园 or coffee plantations 咖啡种植园 in the Americas 美洲, it is still a continuity 延续性. It is still an existence 存在, even though the scale 规模 is growing -- that has not changed. +

And another part of mercantilism 重商主义 is that the mother country 宗主国 benefits 获益, yes, by taking resources 获取资源 and extracting resources 开采资源 out of their colonies 殖民地, but also because those colonies 殖民地 provide new markets 提供新市场 for the mother country 宗主国 to send manufactured goods 制成品 to. +

All of this is a continuation 延续 in economic practice 经济实践 compared to what we've already learned about in class, right? European countries have colonized 殖民, are using mercantilist policies 重商主义政策, they're using enslaved labor 奴役劳动力, they're extracting resources 开采资源 from their colonies 殖民地 in the Americas 美洲 or sometimes in the Indian Ocean region 印度洋地区 in order to gain themselves lots of wealth 大量财富 and lots of power 强大权力. +

And the Europeans are dominating 主导 the transatlantic trade 跨大西洋贸易, they're dominating 主导 the Indian Ocean trade 印度洋贸易 by this point. +

Now that we've covered the continuities 延续性, let's talk about the changes -- the things that are new to economic development 经济发展. +

Think about Europe during the Middle Ages 中世纪: it is controlled by feudalism 封建主义 and manorialism 庄园制, those political and economic practices 政治和经济制度. And slowly over time from, you know, the 1200s to now, there has been a release of 解除 that kind of control on the general populace 普通民众 of the serfs 农奴 or the peasants 农民 or the lower class 下层阶级 in Europe. +

And it is because of that -- because this traditional landholding power 传统土地所有权 has been released 解除 -- that Europe is able to make some economic changes 经济变革 in order to make as much money as possible 尽可能多地赚钱. +

Corporate entities 企业实体 and governments start freeing people from restrictions 解除限制 within labor and trade 劳动和贸易领域. That, plus the fact that the enclosure acts 圈地法案 led to 导致 a lot of urbanization 城市化 in European cities, plus the fact that the Agricultural Revolution 农业革命 -- you guessed it -- revolutionized 彻底改变 agriculture due to new technological innovations 技术创新, means that Europe is slowly marching toward 迈向 this market economy 市场经济. +

And the way that the Europeans make their goods prior to 在…之前 the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 is through the putting-out system 外放制, which is sometimes also called a cottage industry 家庭手工业. +

If you are planning on 打算 making a shirt in England, someone can be responsible for 负责 raising the sheep 养羊, and then someone harvests the wool 收割羊毛, and then someone spins the wool 纺羊毛, and then someone weaves the wool 织羊毛, and these are all happening at different places 不同地点 so that eventually they will make their way to a market 进入市场 where a finished good 成品 will be sold. +

Development of a market economy 市场经济发展 as Europe is slowly marching toward 迈向 more capitalistic economic policies 资本主义经济政策 leads to 导致 the creation of 创造 new things like insurance 保险 and banks 银行. +

Banking institutions 银行机构 start to turn their private savings 私人储蓄 into venture capital 风险资本, which they then plug back into 投入 these early industries 早期产业 that are developing. +

And with all of these new products being produced in a shorter amount of time than before 比以前更短时间内生产出来 means that consumerism 消费主义 is going to rise 兴起. People want all the best new things. +

H, is there anything new under the sun 天下有什么新鲜事? That is a continuity 延续性 in history. We always want the newest, the shiniest, the biggest, the best. +

So did Europeans back in, you know, the 1600s and 1700s. And just as we are today, Europeans are influenced by 受…影响 other places around the world, namely 即；也就是 their colonies 殖民地. +

So as they are gaining resources 获取资源 and taking trade 开展贸易 or new goods 新产品 from other areas, they are getting influenced by those new goods 受这些新产品影响, and things like luxury goods 奢侈品, porcelain 瓷器, and China 中国（瓷器） become hot commodities 热门商品 in Europe. +

So to summarize 总结, there are a lot of economic continuities 经济延续性 like the continued use of mercantilist policies 持续使用重商主义政策, the continued reliance on 持续依赖 enslaved labor 奴役劳动力, and the fact that Europe is dominating global trade 主导全球贸易. +

There are new changes too with the putting-out system 外放制 or the cottage industry 家庭手工业, and the development of new banking systems 银行体系 or insurance systems 保险体系 that essentially produced early VC companies 早期风险投资公司 that could then fund all of their money back into the industry 为产业注资. +

I wonder what that's going to lead to 导致什么结果, students. Hope this helped, and as always, you can do it. I believe in you. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我要把3.3和3.4的主题结合起来，因为它们都涉及经济发展，所以我们直接进入正题吧。 +

我们知道第三单元是关于"专制主义"和"立宪主义"，**这些新的"专制君主"通过许多经济变革, 来获取权力, 并积累财富。**但"延续性"总是比较容易讨论，所以我就从这里开始讲。 +

**"延续性"是指在特定时间段内保持不变的事物，而"变化"则是在特定时间段内发生偏离的事物 (时代在改变)。这是AP考试希望你们掌握的关键历史思维技能，**并且你们会在考试中被考查到。 +
所以，如果你在"做比较"、"因果关系", 或"延续与变化"（CCOT）等技能方面有困难，一定要查看我的终极复习资料包，因为我为你们准备了大量的技能备考内容。 +

好的，在前两个单元的学习中延续下来的"经济方面的延续性"是：欧洲国家由于在新世界的殖民地采取的"重商主义"政策，仍然在获取大量财富。 +
而且，随着更多被奴役的非洲人通过 “中间航程（Middle Passage）” 被送往美洲的甘蔗种植园或咖啡种植园工作，跨大西洋奴隶制度的规模在不断扩大，但这仍然是一种延续。尽管规模在扩大，但这种制度依然存在，这一点没有改变。 +

*"重商主义"的另一个方面是，母国不仅通过从殖民地获取资源而获益，还因为殖民地为母国提供了新的市场，母国可以向这些市场输送制成品。(即把殖民地当做产业链低端, 母国作为产业链高端.)* +

与我们在课堂上学到的内容相比，所有这些在经济实践方面都是一种延续，对吧？欧洲国家进行殖民统治，采用重商主义政策，使用奴隶劳动力，从他们在美洲或有时在印度洋地区的殖民地开采资源，以便为自己获取大量财富和权力。 +

既然我们已经讨论了"延续性"，那就来谈谈"变化"——经济发展中出现的新情况。 +

想想**中世纪的欧洲：它由"封建主义"和"庄园制度"这些政治和经济实践所控制。#从13世纪左右开始，随着时间的推移，对欧洲的农奴、农民或下层阶级的那种控制, 逐渐放松。#** +
*正是因为这种传统的"土地所有权"控制的放松，欧洲才能够进行一些经济变革，以便尽可能多地赚钱。* +

*企业实体和政府, 开始解除对劳动力和贸易的限制。再加上《圈地法案》（enclosure acts）导致欧洲城市出现了大量的城市化，以及农业革命——你们猜对了——由于新的技术创新革新了农业，这意味着欧洲正在慢慢走向市场经济。* +

*#在工业革命之前，欧洲人生产商品的方式, 是通过 “外放制(外包?)（putting-out system）”，这种方式有时也被称为"家庭手工业"#*（cottage industry）。 +
如果你计划在英国制作一件衬衫，有人负责养羊，然后有人收割羊毛，接着有人纺羊毛，然后有人织羊毛，这些工序在不同的地方进行，最终这些制成品会进入市场销售。 +

*随着欧洲慢慢走向更多的"资本主义"经济政策，市场经济的发展, 导致了保险和银行等新事物的产生。* +
银行机构开始把私人储蓄转化为风险资本，然后把这些风险资本, 投入到正在发展的早期产业中。 +

而且，所有这些新产品的生产时间, 比以前更短，这意味着消费主义将会兴起。人们想要所有最好的新东西。 +
嗯，阳光下有新事物吗？这在历史上也是一种延续。我们总是想要最新的、最闪亮的、最大的、最好的东西。 +

在17世纪和18世纪的欧洲人也是如此。就像我们现在一样，欧洲人受到世界其他地方的影响，特别是他们的殖民地。 +
所以，当他们从其他地区获取资源、进行贸易, 或获得新商品时，他们受到这些新商品的影响，像奢侈品、瓷器, 和来自中国的商品, 在欧洲成为热门商品。 +

所以总结一下，**存在很多经济方面的延续性，**比如持续使用重商主义政策、持续依赖奴隶劳动力，以及欧洲在全球贸易中占据主导地位。 +
**同时也有新的变化，**比如 “外放制” 或家庭手工业，以及新的银行系统或保险系统的发展，这些系统本质上产生了早期的风险投资公司，这些公司可以把资金再投入到产业中。 +

同学们，我想知道这会导致什么结果。希望这对你们有帮助，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. I'm going to combine topics 3.3 and 3.4 together because they both deal with economic development, so let's just get right into this.

We know that unit 3 is absolutism and constitutionalism, and these new absolute monarchs are gaining their power and supporting their wealth through a lot of economic changes. But continuities are always easier to talk about, so that's where I'm going to start.

A continuity is something that stays the same over a given time period, and changes are things that veer off -- that change during a given time period. This is a key historical thinking skill that the AP test wants you to know and that you will be tested on.

So if you are struggling with skills like comparison, causation, or CCOT, make sure that you check out my Ultimate Review Packet because I have a ton of skills prep for you.

All right, economic continuities that have continued from the first two units of study: European countries are still gaining an incredible amount of wealth due to their mercantilist policies from their colonies in the New World.

And while that transatlantic slave system is ramping up in size as more enslaved Africans are sent along the Middle Passage to work in sugar plantations or coffee plantations in the Americas, it is still a continuity. It is still an existence, even though the scale is growing -- that has not changed.

And another part of mercantilism is that the mother country benefits, yes, by taking resources and extracting resources out of their colonies, but also because those colonies provide new markets for the mother country to send manufactured goods to.

All of this is a continuation in economic practice compared to what we've already learned about in class, right? European countries have colonized, are using mercantilist policies, they're using enslaved labor, they're extracting resources from their colonies in the Americas or sometimes in the Indian Ocean region in order to gain themselves lots of wealth and lots of power.

And the Europeans are dominating the transatlantic trade, they're dominating the Indian Ocean trade by this point.

Now that we've covered the continuities, let's talk about the changes -- the things that are new to economic development.

Think about Europe during the Middle Ages: it is controlled by feudalism and manorialism, those political and economic practices. And slowly over time from, you know, the 1200s to now, there has been a release of that kind of control on the general populace of the serfs or the peasants or the lower class in Europe.

And it is because of that -- because this traditional landholding power has been released -- that Europe is able to make some economic changes in order to make as much money as possible.

Corporate entities and governments start freeing people from restrictions within labor and trade. That, plus the fact that the enclosure acts led to a lot of urbanization in European cities, plus the fact that the Agricultural Revolution -- you guessed it -- revolutionized agriculture due to new technological innovations, means that Europe is slowly marching toward this market economy.

And the way that the Europeans make their goods prior to the Industrial Revolution is through the putting-out system, which is sometimes also called a cottage industry.

If you are planning on making a shirt in England, someone can be responsible for raising the sheep, and then someone harvests the wool, and then someone spins the wool, and then someone weaves the wool, and these are all happening at different places so that eventually they will make their way to a market where a finished good will be sold.

Development of a market economy as Europe is slowly marching toward more capitalistic economic policies leads to the creation of new things like insurance and banks.

Banking institutions start to turn their private savings into venture capital, which they then plug back into these early industries that are developing.

And with all of these new products being produced in a shorter amount of time than before means that consumerism is going to rise. People want all the best new things.

H, is there anything new under the sun? That is a continuity in history. We always want the newest, the shiniest, the biggest, the best.

So did Europeans back in, you know, the 1600s and 1700s. And just as we are today, Europeans are influenced by other places around the world, namely their colonies.

So as they are gaining resources and taking trade or new goods from other areas, they are getting influenced by those new goods, and things like luxury goods, porcelain, and China become hot commodities in Europe.

So to summarize, there are a lot of economic continuities like the continued use of mercantilist policies, the continued reliance on enslaved labor, and the fact that Europe is dominating global trade.

There are new changes too with the putting-out system or the cottage industry, and the development of new banking systems or insurance systems that essentially produced early VC companies that could then fund all of their money back into the industry.

I wonder what that's going to lead to, students. Hope this helped, and as always, you can do it. I believe in you.
