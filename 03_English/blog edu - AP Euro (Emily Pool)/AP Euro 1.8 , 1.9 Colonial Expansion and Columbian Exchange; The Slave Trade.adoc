== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·富尔（Emily Fool）。咱们来聊聊哥伦布大交换（the Columbian Exchange）吧。 +

嘿，你能想象自己16岁时第一次品尝巧克力的情景吗？你能想象作为一个成年人第一次见到一匹马会是什么样的感受吗？哥伦布大交换真是太不可思议了。 +

欧洲对美洲以及整个亚洲的殖民扩张，使欧洲占据了主导地位，但同时也引发了大规模的动植物交换。*新的植物、动物和疾病, 从世界的一个地区传播到了另一个地区。* +

小麦、牛、马、猪和羊从亚非欧大陆（Afro-Eurasia）来到了美洲。西红柿、土豆、南瓜、玉米和烟草则从美洲传到了亚非欧大陆。 +

如今，*那些在亚非欧大陆社会中已经存在了数千年的疾病, 传播到了美洲，几乎使当地的原住民人口灭绝。结果就是可供他们驱使进行强迫劳动的原住民越来越少。* +

**拥有殖民地的欧洲人, 开始依赖从非洲（Africa）进行的奴隶贸易。**美洲种植园制度的发展——无论是巴西（Brazil）的甘蔗种植园，还是北美的棉花和烟草种植园——都导致了对奴隶劳动力的依赖日益增加。 +

让我们来想想在非洲、欧洲和美洲之间建立的**"三角贸易体系"**吧。*被奴役的非洲人被带出非洲，沿着 “中间航道”（Middle Passage）被运往美洲，在种植园里劳作。* +
*从那些种植园生产出来的原材料, 被运往欧洲，在那里可以进行加工和制造。欧洲人通过向非洲提供枪支和酒，来换取那些被奴役的人。* +

想想看，*由于这种贸易体系，非洲和美洲在人口结构方面, 发生了多么严重的变化。* +

**当欧洲人殖民美洲时，历史学家估计，90% 到 95% 的原住民死亡，**原因你懂的，包括疾病的蓄意传播、冲突以及征服。 +
*大约有1200万非洲人被带出非洲，运往美洲。在人口结构和文化方面的损失是*…… +

但如果我们具体来看非洲，被掳走的奴隶——尤其是被送往巴西甘蔗种植园的奴隶，我得补充一下，**在那里奴隶的预期寿命只有23岁——主要是男性。**这也给非洲社会在未来带来了人口结构方面的问题。 +

人口结构的变化、文化的丧失, 以及对人们的征服，这些都是灾难性的。我们很容易在历史课本上读到这些内容，然后想：“哦，是的，那很糟糕，不过那都是很久以前的事了。” +

但我确实想鼓励你们去好好体会一下当时的情景。并非所有的历史都是……但我确实希望这个视频能让你们以一种全新的方式来思考这个问题。 +

同学们，你们一直都能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily Fool. Let's talk about the Columbian Exchange.

Hey, could you imagine being 16 years old and trying chocolate for the very first time? Can you imagine what it would have been like to see a horse for the very first time as an adult? The Columbian Exchange is wild.

Europe's colonial expansion into the Americas and throughout Asia led to European dominance, but also led to this massive exchange of flora and fauna. New plants, animals, and diseases made their way from one region of the world to the other region of the world.

Wheat, cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep come from Afro-Eurasia to the Americas. Tomatoes, potatoes, squash, corn, and tobacco come from the Americas back to Afro-Eurasia.

Now, diseases which had had millennia to settle in Afro-Eurasian societies make their way over to the Americas and just decimate indigenous populations. All that there are fewer indigenous peoples to do the forced labor for them.

Europeans with their colonies start to rely on the slave trade from Africa. The development of plantation systems in the Americas -- whether that was the sugar plantations in Brazil or cotton and tobacco plantations in North America -- led to the increased reliance on enslaved labor.

Let's think about this triangle trading system that was set up between Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Enslaved Africans were taken out of Africa and shipped along the Middle Passage to do plantation labor in the Americas.

Raw materials produced from those plantations were shipped up to Europe where they could be processed and manufactured. Europe was able to trade for those enslaved peoples in Africa by giving them guns and alcohol.

Talk about the severity of the demographic changes that occurred in both Africa and the Americas as a result of this.

When the Europeans colonized the Americas, historians estimate that between 90 and 95% of indigenous peoples died due to -- you know -- the intentional spreading of disease and due to conflict and conquest.

But if we're specifically looking at Africa, the enslaved peoples who were taken -- especially for the sugar plantations in Brazil where the life expectancy might I add was 23 years old -- were predominantly men. And that causes demographic problems down the road in African societies as well.

The demographic changes, the cultural loss, the subjugation of people is catastrophic. It's so easy for us to read about this in a history textbook and be like, "Oh yeah, that was bad, that was a while ago."

But I do want to encourage you to just sit in what that would have been like. Not all of history is... but I do hope that this video may be made you think about it in a new way.

Always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.
