==== AP Euro Topic 8.2 World War I 第一次世界大战
Europe at the turn of the 20th century 在20世纪之交 was kind of a wreck 一片混乱. The Concert of Europe 欧洲协调 had broken down 瓦解. There were all of those revolutions in the 1850s. Industrialization 工业化 led to 导致 imperialism 帝国主义. Europe was colonizing 殖民 areas around the world. There's like a lot of conflict 冲突 going on. +

Europe is also developing new fun weapons that they can now mass produce 批量生产. +

Four main causes that led up to 导致 World War One are militarism 军国主义, alliances 联盟, imperialism 帝国主义, and nationalism 民族主义. M-A-I-N -- it's an acronym 首字母缩写词. Do you get it? +

What initially 最初 started out as a regional dispute 地区争端 in the Balkans 巴尔干地区 turned into 变成 a World War because of this alliance system 联盟体系. And these Europeans are now fighting with machine guns 机枪 which you can't protect yourself against 抵御, which leads to 导致 trench warfare 堑壕战, which leads to a stalemate 僵局, which then turns World War One into a war of attrition 消耗战 -- who can literally outlast 比…持久 the other side. +

Key things to know about this: It's a global conflict 全球性冲突. European countries have colonies 殖民地 and they force those colonists 殖民者 to fight in the conflict. And there's some genocide 种族灭绝 and some imperial aggression 帝国侵略 too in the collapse of Austria-Hungary 奥匈帝国的瓦解. And also the mandate system 委任统治制度 in Southwest Asia 西南亚 and the political and economic chaos 政治经济混乱 that occurs after it sets the stage for 为…奠定基础 World War II. +

==== Topic 8.3 The Russian Revolution 俄国革命
Going to try to talk about the Russian Revolution in one take 一口气. And I also love the Russian Revolution because all they want is peace, land, and bread. +

Okay, 1905 was the end of the Russo-Japanese War 日俄战争. Russia has just lost to Japan. That is going to expose 暴露 the weakness in Russia's lack of industrialization 工业化不足. +

And also in that same year, Bloody Sunday 血腥星期日 happens. These workers start to petition for 请愿 better working conditions because industrialization was slow to spread to Russia. They march on 向…进军 the Tsar's palace 沙皇宫殿, and then Tsar Nicholas 沙皇尼古拉 orders his guards to fire into the crowd 向人群开枪. This is called Bloody Sunday. +

The proletariat 无产阶级 -- the working class 工人阶级 -- is starting to divide on two different lines 分裂成两派: the Mensheviks 孟什维克 and the Bolsheviks 布尔什维克. The Bolsheviks are going to be more radical 激进的 and led by Lenin 列宁. But then Lenin is forced to exile 流放 and flee Russia 逃离俄国. +

February 1917, workers again march on the palace, and this time Tsar Nicholas II abdicates the throne 退位. A weak provisional government 临时政府 is set up under Alexander Kerensky 亚历山大·克伦斯基. The whole Kornilov Affair 科尔尼洛夫事件 thing happens. Lenin is brought back to Russia where he leads the October Revolution 十月革命. He's successful. +

This then throws Russia into a civil war 内战 for four years. Bunch of outside powers 外部势力 get involved. And then Lenin is like, "Oh, um, also we need to institute 实行 this New Economic Policy 新经济政策." +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.3 Russian Revolution and Its Effects 俄国革命及其影响
World War One was a disaster 灾难 for Russia because of their political problems 政治问题, their social inequality 社会不平等, and also their kind of lack at industrialization by this point 工业化不足. +

Revolutions began in 1905 and were squashed 镇压 by the Russian government, but those ideas -- that revolutionary sentiment 革命情绪 -- continued into the 1910s. +

February of 1917, these angry workers march on Saint Petersburg 圣彼得堡 and form the Petrograd Soviet 彼得格勒苏维埃. Also, also inspired by the International Women's Day protesters 国际妇女节抗议者 -- so go women! +

Tsar Nicholas II was like, "Cool, I don't want to deal with this peace." He abdicates the throne 退位. A provisional government 临时政府 was established under Alexander Kerensky, and it was not successful. +

And it's during the summer of 1917 that Lenin comes back to Russia and then begins to lead this October Revolution 十月革命. Because all he wants is peace, land, and bread, and he gives it to them. +

He takes Russia out of World War One -- that's the peace part 和平部分. He redistributes land 重新分配土地 to the poor -- that's the land part 土地部分. And then he also makes some economic reforms 经济改革 so that they have more food. +

This then leads to a civil war 内战 in Russia, and that ends with the formation of 形成 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR 苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟. And then Lenin dies and Stalin 斯大林 takes over 接管, and everything's bad. +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.4 Versailles Peace Settlement 凡尔赛和平协议
After World War One, Europe was like, "What?" They decided that they never wanted to do that again, and they went about doing that by forming the League of Nations 国际联盟 -- attempting to 试图 unite all these countries together, but that was ultimately unsuccessful 最终失败. +

It's in France where they were like, "Let's punish Germany for everything, including starting the war." +

The Austro-Hungarian Empire 奥匈帝国 is no more 不复存在, and it fragments into 分裂成 smaller countries that have a lot of struggles at the beginning. These democratic successor states 民主继承国 like Hungary 匈牙利 and Poland 波兰 and Yugoslavia 南斯拉夫 face a lot of political and economic challenges 政治经济挑战. +

Also, Germany, man -- those reparations 赔款. Not a great idea. +

Britain and France -- again, important to know that the League of Nations does say, "Hey, you know what? This former Ottoman Empire 前奥斯曼帝国 is no more, so what should we do about it? Let's divide it up into a mandate system 委任统治制度 so that Britain and France specifically can get access to 获得 Middle Eastern oil 中东石油." +

This lack of political stability 政治不稳定 plus some economic crises 经济危机 that are about to happen -- it's gonna be bad in Europe in a couple years. +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.5 Global Economic Crisis 全球经济危机
Prolonged times of 长期的 economic instability 经济不稳定 -- political crises 政治危机 happen, and that's for sure what happens in Europe after World War One. +

The Great Depression 大萧条 ravages 重创 already war-torn Europe 饱受战争蹂躏的欧洲 after World War One. It's caused by weakness in international trade 国际贸易疲软. It's also caused by not great economic theories and practices 糟糕的经济理论和实践 -- debt 债务, overproduction 生产过剩, nationalistic tariff policies 民族主义关税政策. +

All this economy in Europe. And of course, in the midst of this instability 在这种不稳定局势中, one strong leader that promises to remedy 解决 every problem will rise to power 掌权. +

So it cripples 削弱 these emerging democracies 新兴民主国家 in Europe after World War One. And so many European countries relied on 依赖 American investment 美国投资 now, so that in 1929 when the stock market crashes 股市崩盘, man, everything's awful. +

There were new economic policies proposed 提出 to try to remedy this economic crisis 经济危机 in Europe after World War One -- like the Popular Front 人民阵线 in France or Keynesian economics 凯恩斯经济学 in Britain. +

Some European countries also attempted to forge political alliances 结成政治联盟, but this was unsuccessful. And fascism 法西斯主义 and dictators 独裁者 rose to power 掌权 in the interwar years 两次世界大战之间的时期. And these Western democracies 西方民主国家 are going to be weakened by these extremist political movements 极端政治运动. +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.6 Fascism and Totalitarianism (part 1) 法西斯主义和极权主义（第一部分）
Post-war bitterness 战后的怨恨 and economic instability 经济不稳定 paves the way for 为…铺平道路 the rise of these fascist leaders 法西斯领导人的崛起. And this is something I'm going to talk about in multiple videos because I love talking about fascism 法西斯主义 because it is so extremely interesting. +

In my class, what I like to do is teach artistic responses to 对…的艺术回应 World War One, and I will talk about that maybe a little bit later in our next video. +

But for now, I want to talk about how fascists use propaganda 宣传 to uphold their position 维护他们的地位. They glorify war 美化战争 and nationalism 民族主义 in order to attract those that are disillusioned 幻想破灭的人, and they do this through manipulative propaganda 操纵性宣传. +

1933 -- the first year that Hitler becomes Chancellor 总理. Hitler tasks 指派 Leni Riefenstahl with creating a documentary film 纪录片 called "The Triumph of the Will" 《意志的胜利》, and this is regarded as 被认为是 one of the most masterful pieces of propaganda 最巧妙的宣传作品 ever produced. +

This award-winning film helps cultivate 培养 this cult of personality 个人崇拜 around Hitler, which he then also uses in order to amass more power and followers 积累更多权力和追随者. Plus, new technology like radio really helps with that. +

And Joseph Goebbels 约瑟夫·戈培尔 becomes the Minister of Propaganda 宣传部长 for the Nazi Party 纳粹党. +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.6 Fascism and Totalitarianism (part 2) 法西斯主义和极权主义（第二部分）
Yeah, girl's gonna go on a tangent 跑题 and talk about one of my favorite artistic movements 艺术运动 after World War One, which is called futurism 未来主义. Again, my favorite -- I mean, like, the most interesting. +

This started in the 1920s in Italy. Hey, let's think about the context 背景. What had just happened prior to 在…之前 the 1920s in Italy? What's happening in the 1920s and into the 1930s in Italy? +

World War One just happened, and fascism 法西斯主义 is on the rise 兴起. +

Futurists championed 拥护 war as a means of 作为…的手段 cleansing away 清除 the stagnant past 停滞的过去. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti 菲利波·托马索·马里内蒂 was the father of futurism 未来主义之父, and he said -- and I quote 引用 -- "We will glorify war -- the only true hygiene of the world." +

Marinetti also advocated for 倡导 the destruction of museums and libraries and other repositories of information 信息存储库, which he regarded as 认为是 mausoleums of the past 过去的陵墓. +

This is called "Armored Train" 《装甲列车》 by Gino Severini 吉诺·塞韦里尼. This is a great example of futurism 未来主义. +

In AP Euro, students, you know that art imitates life 艺术源于生活, and this is a great example of Italy in the 1920s. +

AP Euro Topic 8.6 Fascism and Totalitarianism (part 3) 法西斯主义和极权主义（第三部分）
Uh, but Hitler and Mussolini 墨索里尼 were not the only two totalitarian leaders 极权主义领导人 that came into power 掌权 after World War One in Europe. +

World War One exposed the weaknesses in Russia, especially regarding 关于 their industrialization 工业化 and bad economic policies 糟糕的经济政策. +

Let's talk about Stalin 斯大林. He does this through his five-year plans 五年计划 and his collectivization of agriculture 农业集体化. +

Five-year plans created a socialist command economy 社会主义计划经济 in which the government controlled everything, and the government focused on 专注于 rapid and rampant industrialization 快速而迅猛的工业化. +

And his collectivization of agriculture included liquidating 清算 the kulaks 富农. These landowning peasants 拥有土地的农民 were seen as enemies of the state 国家的敌人 and owned land, and the government wanted the land. +

So then he starved a lot of them 使很多人挨饿 and also sent them to forced labor camps 劳改营 and gulags 古拉格集中营. Not to mention his Great Purges 大清洗, which is really getting rid of 清除 anyone who disagrees with him or his economic or political ideology 经济或政治理念. +

This is a common thing when it comes to cults of personality 个人崇拜. Like Hitler, Stalin also utilized 利用 a secret police 秘密警察. These European fascists 法西斯分子 are ruling by terror 恐怖统治, and it's pretty bad. +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.6 Fascism and Totalitarianism (part 4) 法西斯主义和极权主义（第四部分）
And lastly, Franco 佛朗哥. Francisco Franco 弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥 was a fascist 法西斯分子 living in Spain, and he allied with 与…结盟 Italian and German fascists in the Spanish Civil War 西班牙内战. +

Western democracies did not intervene in 干预 this Spanish Civil War, which was from 1936 to 1939. I wonder if that -- I don't know -- inspires some German aggression 德国的侵略 throughout the European continent 欧洲大陆. +

And this also does set up 建立 authoritarian rule 独裁统治 in Spain until the 1970s. +

Because I like talking about artistic responses to war 对战争的艺术回应, I mean, come on -- Picasso's "Guernica" 毕加索的《格尔尼卡》. This highlights 凸显 the tragedies of war 战争的悲剧 and the impact that it has on regular civilians 对普通平民的影响. +

And lastly, let's talk about the Valley of the Fallen 烈士谷. This is actually where Francisco Franco was buried until his body was exhumed 挖掘 in 2019. +

Freaking leaders and their monumental architecture 纪念性建筑 to keep their legacy forever 永垂不朽. Hey, that's actually like a really neat thing. We can think about the ways that us in the United States are trying to maybe remove some monuments 纪念碑 in order to change legacies of leaders 改变领导人的历史评价. +

It's like history connects to itself 历史相互关联. Whoa. +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.7 Europe During the Interwar Period 两次世界大战之间的欧洲
If you haven't been paying attention by now, Europe during the interwar period 在两次世界大战之间的时期 -- this 20-year time period between World War One and World War II -- is not doing great. +

Crises that is then exacerbated by 因…而加剧 the U.S. stock market crash 美国股市崩盘 in the 1920s leads to 导致 the rise of these powerful totalitarian leaders 强大的极权主义领导人 that promise that they will make their nation strong and great 使国家强大 and also will redeem 扭转 any economic problem that's happening. +

Britain and France are trying their best to make sure another war doesn't break out 爆发 in Europe, and they do this through non-intervention 不干预. We see that in the Spanish Civil War 西班牙内战. +

But then we definitely also see that as Hitler starts to gain and consolidate his power 巩固权力 in Germany. The U.S. is like, "Peace, I'm not going to deal with any of that." +

So these fascists 法西斯分子, unchecked by 未受…遏制 Western capitalist democracies 西方资本主义民主国家, start to seize more land 夺取更多土地. Hitler re-militarizes the Rhineland 重新武装莱茵兰, takes Austria 吞并奥地利, and also the Sudetenland 苏台德地区. +

Meanwhile, Britain and France are like, "Okay, you can do that, Hitler." Which, like, don't do anything else. +

The Italian fascists are like, "Great, let's take over 占领 Ethiopia 埃塞俄比亚." +

Meanwhile, Hitler and Stalin were like, "Hey, non-aggression pacts 互不侵犯条约 that we can each take part of Poland? Cool." +

Appeasement 绥靖政策 has clearly failed, and World War II breaks out 爆发. +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.8 World War II 第二次世界大战
We have arrived at 来到 World War II. The AP test actually doesn't really care that you know anything about the battles, which I think is excellent. +

They do, however, care that you know how technology and innovation 技术与创新 continue to change warfare 战争, and they especially want you to know about blitzkrieg 闪电战. +

Blitzkrieg 闪电战 -- throw everything that you have at 向…发动 all your enemies all at once 一次性 in three waves 三个波次. Yes, this is very effective 有效的 and did lead to 导致 a lot of Axis victories 轴心国胜利 early on in the war. +

But it also is very costly in resources 资源消耗巨大. It's like history repeats itself 历史重演. +

Because of blitzkrieg, France surrendered 投降 pretty early on in World War II. Okay. +

Also, your history books won't tell you this, but the Nazis totally used a lot of methamphetamines 甲基苯丙胺. There are so many good news articles and podcasts out there about this. +

Anyway, the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union 苏联 really did work cooperatively together 合作 to try to stop war in Europe. I mean, like, ones that had broken out 已经爆发的战争. +

Resistance of civilians 平民抵抗, superior military technology 先进军事技术, and then also just the commitment to 致力于 withstanding Hitler's aggression 抵御希特勒的侵略 did eventually lead to Allied victories 盟军胜利. +

Man, all this industrialized warfare 工业化战争, and now there are nukes

'''


== 中文释义

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.2 第一次世界大战

**20世纪初的欧洲一片混乱。欧洲"协调体系"(均势体系)已经瓦解。**19世纪50年代发生了一系列革命。**工业化导致了帝国主义的出现 (能力越大, 野心越大)。**欧洲正在对世界各地进行殖民。有很多冲突正在发生。 +

欧洲也在研发新的有趣武器，并且能够大规模生产这些武器。 +

**导致第一次世界大战的四个主要原因是: 军国主义、联盟、帝国主义和民族主义。**取这四个词的英文首字母，M-A-I-N（军国主义Militarism、联盟Alliances、帝国主义Imperialism、民族主义Nationalism）——这是一个缩写。你明白了吗？ +

**最初在巴尔干地区的局部争端，由于联盟体系(结盟), 演变成了一场世界大战(犹如链条一样, 把双方集团都拉下水)。**欧洲人现在使用机枪作战，而人们无法抵御机枪的攻击，这导致了堑壕战，进而导致了僵局，这使得第一次世界大战变成了一场消耗战——比的是谁能坚持得更久。 +

关于这场战争需要了解的关键信息是：这是一场全球性冲突。**欧洲国家拥有殖民地，并且强迫殖民地人民参与这场冲突。**在奥匈帝国的崩溃过程中，还存在"种族灭绝"和帝国主义侵略行为。此外，西亚的委任统治制度, 以及**随之而来的政治和经济混乱，为第二次世界大战埋下了伏笔。** +

==== 主题 8.3 俄国革命

我尝试一次性讲完俄国革命。我也很喜欢俄国革命，因为他们所追求的就是和平、土地和面包。 +

好的，1905年"日俄战争"结束。俄国输给了日本。这暴露了俄国在工业化方面的不足。 +

同样在这一年，“血腥星期日” 事件发生。工人们开始请愿，要求改善工作条件，因为工业化在俄国的传播很缓慢。他们向沙皇的宫殿进军，然后沙皇尼古拉下令他的卫兵向人群开枪。这就是 “血腥星期日” 事件。 +

无产阶级——**工人阶级——开始分化为两个不同的派别：孟什维克, 和布尔什维克。布尔什维克更加激进，由列宁领导。**但随后列宁被迫流亡，逃离俄国。 +

1917年2月，工人们再次向宫殿进军，这次沙皇尼古拉二世退位。由亚历山大·克伦斯基领导建立了一个软弱的临时政府。"科尔尼洛夫事件"也发生了。列宁被召回俄国，在那里他领导了十月革命。他成功了。 +

**这随后使俄国陷入了一场为期四年的内战。许多外部势力参与其中。**然后列宁说：“哦，嗯，我们还需要实行新经济政策。” +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.3 俄国革命及其影响

第一次世界大战对俄国来说是一场灾难，因为俄国存在政治问题、社会不平等，而且在那个时候俄国的工业化也有所不足。 +

1905年革命爆发，但被俄国政府镇压，然而那些革命思想——那种革命情绪——在20世纪10年代仍在延续。 +
1917年2月，愤怒的工人们向圣彼得堡进军，并成立了彼得格勒苏维埃。同时，国际妇女节的抗议者也带来了启发——女性加油！ +
沙皇尼古拉二世说：“好吧，我不想处理这些关于和平的问题。” 他退位了。由亚历山大·克伦斯基领导建立了一个临时政府，但这个政府并不成功。 +

在1917年夏天，列宁回到俄国，然后开始领导十月革命。因为他所追求的就是和平、土地和面包，并且他做到了这些。 +
他让俄国退出了第一次世界大战——这是和平的部分。他将土地重新分配给穷人——这是土地的部分。然后他还进行了一些经济改革，以便人们能有更多的食物。 +

这随后在俄国引发了一场内战，**内战的结果是"苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟"（苏联，USSR）的成立。**然后列宁去世，斯大林掌权，情况变得糟糕起来。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.4 凡尔赛和平协议

*第一次世界大战后，欧洲人都在想：“这是怎么回事？” 他们决定再也不想经历这样的战争了，于是他们成立了"国际联盟"*——试图将所有这些国家联合起来，但最终没有成功。 +

在法国，他们认为：“我们要惩罚德国的一切行为，包括挑起战争。” +

**奥匈帝国不复存在，它分裂成了一些小国家，这些小国家在一开始面临着很多困难。**像匈牙利、波兰和南斯拉夫这样的民主继承国面临着许多政治和经济挑战。 +

还有德国，天哪——那些赔款。这可不是个好主意。 +

英国和法国——同样重要的是要知道，国际联盟表示：“嘿，你们知道吗？奥斯曼帝国已经不存在了，那我们该怎么办呢？我们把它划分成委任统治地吧，这样英国和法国就能获取中东的石油了。” +

政治不稳定，再加上即将发生的一些经济危机——未来几年欧洲的情况将会很糟糕。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.5 全球经济危机

长期的经济不稳定——政治危机随之而来，这就是第一次世界大战后欧洲的情况。 +

大萧条重创了经历过战争的欧洲。它是由国际贸易的疲软引起的。同时，糟糕的经济理论和实践——债务、生产过剩、民族主义的关税政策——也是大萧条的原因。 +

欧洲的经济就是这样。当然，在这种不稳定的情况下，一个承诺解决所有问题的强大领导人将会崛起。 +

所以，第一次世界大战后，新兴的民主国家受到了严重打击。许多欧洲国家依赖美国的投资，所以1929年股市崩盘时，天哪，一切都变得很糟糕。 +

为了解决第一次世界大战后欧洲的经济危机，人们提出了一些新的经济政策——比如法国的人民阵线政策，还有英国的凯恩斯经济学。 +

一些欧洲国家也试图建立政治联盟，但没有成功。在两次世界大战之间的时期，法西斯主义和独裁统治上台。这些西方民主国家被这些极端政治运动削弱了。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.6 法西斯主义和极权主义（第一部分）

战后的痛苦和经济不稳定为法西斯领导人的崛起铺平了道路。这是我会在多个视频中谈论的内容，因为我喜欢谈论法西斯主义，它真的非常有趣。 +

在我的课上，我喜欢探讨对第一次世界大战的艺术回应，我可能会在接下来的视频中稍微谈谈这个。 +

但现在，我想谈谈法西斯分子是如何利用宣传来维护他们的地位的。他们美化战争和民族主义，以吸引那些幻想破灭的人，他们通过操纵性的宣传来做到这一点。 +

1933年——希特勒成为德国总理的第一年。希特勒让莱尼·里芬斯塔尔拍摄了一部名为《意志的胜利》的纪录片，这部纪录片被认为是有史以来最出色的宣传作品之一。 +

这部获奖影片塑造了围绕希特勒的个人崇拜，他利用这一点来积聚更多的权力和追随者。另外，像收音机这样的新技术也对此起到了推动作用。 +

约瑟夫·戈培尔成为了纳粹党的宣传部长。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.6 法西斯主义和极权主义（第二部分）

是的，我要跑题一下，谈谈第一次世界大战后我最喜欢的艺术运动之一，那就是未来主义。再说一次，我最喜欢的——我的意思是，它真的非常有趣。 +

未来主义于20世纪20年代在意大利兴起。嘿，让我们想想当时的背景。在20世纪20年代之前意大利发生了什么呢？在20世纪20年代到30年代意大利又发生了什么呢？ +

第一次世界大战刚刚结束，法西斯主义正在兴起。 +

未来主义者将战争视为清除停滞不前的过去的一种手段。菲利波·托马索·马里内蒂是未来主义之父，他说——我引用他的话——“我们将歌颂战争——这是世界唯一真正的净化方式。” +

马里内蒂还主张摧毁博物馆、图书馆和其他信息存储机构，他认为这些是过去的陵墓。 +

这是吉诺·塞韦里尼的《装甲列车》。这是未来主义的一个很好的例子。 +

在AP欧洲历史课程中，同学们，你们知道艺术源于生活，这就是20世纪20年代意大利的一个很好的体现。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.6 法西斯主义和极权主义（第三部分）

呃，但希特勒和墨索里尼并不是第一次世界大战后在欧洲掌权的仅有的极权主义领导人。 +

第一次世界大战暴露了俄国的弱点，特别是在工业化和糟糕的经济政策方面。 +

我们来谈谈斯大林。他通过他的五年计划和农业集体化来巩固权力。 +

五年计划建立了社会主义计划经济，在这种经济模式下政府控制着一切，并且政府专注于快速且大规模的工业化。 +

他的农业集体化包括清算富农。这些拥有土地的农民被视为国家的敌人，而政府想要他们的土地。 +

于是，许多农民被饿死，还有一些被送去了强制劳动营和古拉格集中营。更不用说他的大清洗运动了，大清洗就是要清除任何与他的经济或政治意识形态不一致的人。 +

在个人崇拜方面，这是很常见的情况。就像希特勒一样，斯大林也利用秘密警察。这些欧洲法西斯分子通过恐怖手段进行统治，情况非常糟糕。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.6 法西斯主义和极权主义（第四部分）

最后，还有佛朗哥。弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥是西班牙的法西斯分子，他在西班牙内战中与意大利和德国的法西斯分子结盟。 +

西方民主国家没有干预1936年至1939年的西班牙内战。我不知道这是否——引发了德国在欧洲大陆的侵略行为。 +

这也在西班牙建立了独裁统治，这种统治一直持续到20世纪70年代。 +

因为我喜欢谈论对战争的艺术回应，我想说，毕加索的《格尔尼卡》。这幅画凸显了战争的悲剧以及战争对普通平民的影响。 +

最后，让我们谈谈 “阵亡将士谷”。实际上，弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥就葬在这里，直到2019年他的遗体被挖出。 +

那些领导人以及他们的纪念性建筑想要永远留存他们的遗产。嘿，这其实是一件很有趣的事情。我们可以思考一下，美国也在试图移除一些纪念碑，以改变一些领导人在人们心中的形象。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.7 两次世界大战之间的欧洲

如果你们之前没有注意到，在两次世界大战之间的欧洲——也就是第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战之间的20年时间里——情况并不好。 +

美国20世纪20年代的股市崩盘加剧了各种危机，这导致了一些强大的极权主义领导人的崛起，他们承诺会让自己的国家强大和伟大，并且会解决正在发生的经济问题。 +

英国和法国尽最大努力确保欧洲不再爆发战争，他们通过不干预政策来实现这一点。我们在西班牙内战中看到了这一点。 +

但随后我们清楚地看到希特勒开始在德国获得并巩固他的权力。美国则表示：“和平至上，我们不会管这些事。” +

所以这些法西斯分子，由于没有受到西方资本主义民主国家的遏制，开始夺取更多的土地。希特勒重新武装莱茵兰地区，吞并了奥地利，还占领了苏台德地区。 +

与此同时，英国和法国表示：“好吧，希特勒，你可以这么做。” 然后，他们什么也没做。 +

意大利法西斯分子表示：“太好了，我们去占领埃塞俄比亚吧。” +

与此同时，希特勒和斯大林表示：“嘿，我们签订互不侵犯条约，然后各自瓜分波兰，怎么样？” +

绥靖政策显然失败了，第二次世界大战爆发了。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.8 第二次世界大战

我们讲到第二次世界大战了。实际上，AP考试并不太在意你对战争中的战斗细节了解多少，我觉得这挺好的。 +

然而，他们在意的是你要知道技术和创新如何持续改变战争，他们尤其希望你了解闪电战（blitzkrieg）。 +

闪电战——分三波把你所拥有的一切都投向你的敌人。是的，这非常有效，并且在战争早期导致了轴心国的很多胜利。 +

但这也消耗了大量的资源。历史总是在重演。 +

由于闪电战，法国在第二次世界大战早期就投降了。好的。 +

另外，你们的历史书可能不会告诉你这些，但纳粹确实大量使用了甲基苯丙胺（冰毒）。有很多不错的新闻文章和播客都在讲这个。 +

不管怎样，美国、英国和苏联确实进行了合作，试图阻止欧洲的战争。我的意思是，阻止已经爆发的战争。 +

平民的抵抗、先进的军事技术，以及对抗希特勒侵略的决心，最终导致了同盟国的胜利。 +

天哪，所有这些工业化战争，而且现在还有核武器。情况可不妙。 +

==== AP欧洲历史主题 8.9 大屠杀

在我之前的几个视频中，我一直在暗示这些极权主义领导人是如何获得并巩固他们的权力的。他们建立了个人崇拜，然后通过四种特定的方式来获取权力： +

审查制度、教育或再教育、书写或篡改历史，以及宣传。 +

但获得并维持权力的另一种方式是制造 “他者”。希特勒和他所宣扬的德国雅利安种族显然把犹太人视为 “他者”。 +

在反犹主义的推动下，纳粹德国试图在欧洲建立一个新的种族秩序，而这最终导致了大屠杀（Holocaust）的发生。 +

反犹主义并非这个时期所独有，你需要去看看我关于德雷福斯事件的视频。 +

1935年通过的《纽伦堡法案》开启了德国对犹太人的合法歧视。随着时间的推移，这种歧视不断升级，最终演变成了大屠杀。 +

大屠杀的其他受害者还包括罗姆人、政治异见人士、同性恋者、共产主义者等等。 +

我相信你们的老师在这方面教得很好。如果你有任何问题，我去过两个集中营，我很乐意分享我的所见所闻。太令人难过了。 +

==== 主题 8.4 - 8.9 经济问题、法西斯主义的兴起、两次世界大战之间的时期、第二次世界大战和大屠杀

第一次世界大战带来的经济影响——一切都很糟糕。 +

大萧条促使一些人提出了新的经济理论，比如凯恩斯经济学，还有法国的人民阵线政党。 +

当然，在经济危机时期，你知道会发生什么——极权主义领导人的崛起。 +

这些法西斯领导人利用欧洲发生的所有危机，通过宣传来获取并维持权力。他们培养了自己的个人崇拜。 +

法西斯主义在西班牙、德国和意大利兴起。然后东欧出现了独裁统治。与此同时，斯大林在苏联进行农业集体化、实施五年计划以及进行大清洗。 +

西欧强国没有参与西班牙内战，这给了希特勒和墨索里尼继续为所欲为的动力。 +

希特勒重新武装莱茵兰地区，然后吞并了奥地利。关于这件事最有趣的一个事实是，99%的奥地利人投票支持吞并——这都得益于宣传。 +

《慕尼黑协定》是西方绥靖政策的顶峰，当时西方列强把苏台德地区给了德国。 +

希特勒与苏联签订了互不侵犯条约。 +

第二次世界大战爆发了。工业化战争、闪电战、巴巴罗萨计划。 +

==== AP Euro Topic 8.2 World War I
Europe at the turn of the 20th century was kind of a wreck. The Concert of Europe had broken down. There were all of those revolutions in the 1850s. Industrialization led to imperialism. Europe was colonizing areas around the world. There's like a lot of conflict going on.

Europe is also developing new fun weapons that they can now mass produce.

Four main causes that led up to World War One are militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. M-A-I-N -- it's an acronym. Do you get it?

What initially started out as a regional dispute in the Balkans turned into a World War because of this alliance system. And these Europeans are now fighting with machine guns which you can't protect yourself against, which leads to trench warfare, which leads to a stalemate, which then turns World War One into a war of attrition -- who can literally outlast the other side.

Key things to know about this: It's a global conflict. European countries have colonies and they force those colonists to fight in the conflict. And there's some genocide and some imperial aggression too in the collapse of Austria-Hungary. And also the mandate system in Southwest Asia and the political and economic chaos that occurs after it sets the stage for World War II.

==== Topic 8.3 The Russian Revolution
Going to try to talk about the Russian Revolution in one take. And I also love the Russian Revolution because all they want is peace, land, and bread.

Okay, 1905 was the end of the Russo-Japanese War. Russia has just lost to Japan. That is going to expose the weakness in Russia's lack of industrialization.

And also in that same year, Bloody Sunday happens. These workers start to petition for better working conditions because industrialization was slow to spread to Russia. They march on the Tsar's palace, and then Tsar Nicholas orders his guards to fire into the crowd. This is called Bloody Sunday.

The proletariat -- the working class -- is starting to divide on two different lines: the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks are going to be more radical and led by Lenin. But then Lenin is forced to exile and flee Russia.

February 1917, workers again march on the palace, and this time Tsar Nicholas II abdicates the throne. A weak provisional government is set up under Alexander Kerensky. The whole Kornilov Affair thing happens. Lenin is brought back to Russia where he leads the October Revolution. He's successful.

This then throws Russia into a civil war for four years. Bunch of outside powers get involved. And then Lenin is like, "Oh, um, also we need to institute this New Economic Policy."

==== AP Euro Topic 8.3 Russian Revolution and Its Effects
World War One was a disaster for Russia because of their political problems, their social inequality, and also their kind of lack at industrialization by this point.

Revolutions began in 1905 and were squashed by the Russian government, but those ideas -- that revolutionary sentiment -- continued into the 1910s.

February of 1917, these angry workers march on Saint Petersburg and form the Petrograd Soviet. Also, also inspired by the International Women's Day protesters -- so go women!

Tsar Nicholas II was like, "Cool, I don't want to deal with this peace." He abdicates the throne. A provisional government was established under Alexander Kerensky, and it was not successful.

And it's during the summer of 1917 that Lenin comes back to Russia and then begins to lead this October Revolution. Because all he wants is peace, land, and bread, and he gives it to them.

He takes Russia out of World War One -- that's the peace part. He redistributes land to the poor -- that's the land part. And then he also makes some economic reforms so that they have more food.

This then leads to a civil war in Russia, and that ends with the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR. And then Lenin dies and Stalin takes over, and everything's bad.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.4 Versailles Peace Settlement
After World War One, Europe was like, "What?" They decided that they never wanted to do that again, and they went about doing that by forming the League of Nations -- attempting to unite all these countries together, but that was ultimately unsuccessful.

It's in France where they were like, "Let's punish Germany for everything, including starting the war."

The Austro-Hungarian Empire is no more, and it fragments into smaller countries that have a lot of struggles at the beginning. These democratic successor states like Hungary and Poland and Yugoslavia face a lot of political and economic challenges.

Also, Germany, man -- those reparations. Not a great idea.

Britain and France -- again, important to know that the League of Nations does say, "Hey, you know what? This former Ottoman Empire is no more, so what should we do about it? Let's divide it up into a mandate system so that Britain and France specifically can get access to Middle Eastern oil."

This lack of political stability plus some economic crises that are about to happen -- it's gonna be bad in Europe in a couple years.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.5 Global Economic Crisis
Prolonged times of economic instability -- political crises happen, and that's for sure what happens in Europe after World War One.

The Great Depression ravages already war-torn Europe after World War One. It's caused by weakness in international trade. It's also caused by not great economic theories and practices -- debt, overproduction, nationalistic tariff policies.

All this economy in Europe. And of course, in the midst of this instability, one strong leader that promises to remedy every problem will rise to power.

So it cripples these emerging democracies in Europe after World War One. And so many European countries relied on American investment now, so that in 1929 when the stock market crashes, man, everything's awful.

There were new economic policies proposed to try to remedy this economic crisis in Europe after World War One -- like the Popular Front in France or Keynesian economics in Britain.

Some European countries also attempted to forge political alliances, but this was unsuccessful. And fascism and dictators rose to power in the interwar years. And these Western democracies are going to be weakened by these extremist political movements.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.6 Fascism and Totalitarianism (part 1)
Post-war bitterness and economic instability paves the way for the rise of these fascist leaders. And this is something I'm going to talk about in multiple videos because I love talking about fascism because it is so extremely interesting.

In my class, what I like to do is teach artistic responses to World War One, and I will talk about that maybe a little bit later in our next video.

But for now, I want to talk about how fascists use propaganda to uphold their position. They glorify war and nationalism in order to attract those that are disillusioned, and they do this through manipulative propaganda.

1933 -- the first year that Hitler becomes Chancellor. Hitler tasks Leni Riefenstahl with creating a documentary film called "The Triumph of the Will," and this is regarded as one of the most masterful pieces of propaganda ever produced.

This award-winning film helps cultivate this cult of personality around Hitler, which he then also uses in order to amass more power and followers. Plus, new technology like radio really helps with that.

And Joseph Goebbels becomes the Minister of Propaganda for the Nazi Party.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.6 Fascism and Totalitarianism (part 2)
Yeah, girl's gonna go on a tangent and talk about one of my favorite artistic movements after World War One, which is called futurism. Again, my favorite -- I mean, like, the most interesting.

This started in the 1920s in Italy. Hey, let's think about the context. What had just happened prior to the 1920s in Italy? What's happening in the 1920s and into the 1930s in Italy?

World War One just happened, and fascism is on the rise.

Futurists championed war as a means of cleansing away the stagnant past. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti was the father of futurism, and he said -- and I quote -- "We will glorify war -- the only true hygiene of the world."

Marinetti also advocated for the destruction of museums and libraries and other repositories of information, which he regarded as mausoleums of the past.

This is called "Armored Train" by Gino Severini. This is a great example of futurism.

In AP Euro, students, you know that art imitates life, and this is a great example of Italy in the 1920s.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.6 Fascism and Totalitarianism (part 3)
Uh, but Hitler and Mussolini were not the only two totalitarian leaders that came into power after World War One in Europe.

World War One exposed the weaknesses in Russia, especially regarding their industrialization and bad economic policies.

Let's talk about Stalin. He does this through his five-year plans and his collectivization of agriculture.

Five-year plans created a socialist command economy in which the government controlled everything, and the government focused on rapid and rampant industrialization.

And his collectivization of agriculture included liquidating the kulaks. These landowning peasants were seen as enemies of the state and owned land, and the government wanted the land.

So then he starved a lot of them and also sent them to forced labor camps and gulags. Not to mention his Great Purges, which is really getting rid of anyone who disagrees with him or his economic or political ideology.

This is a common thing when it comes to cults of personality. Like Hitler, Stalin also utilized a secret police. These European fascists are ruling by terror, and it's pretty bad.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.6 Fascism and Totalitarianism (part 4)
And lastly, Franco. Francisco Franco was a fascist living in Spain, and he allied with Italian and German fascists in the Spanish Civil War.

Western democracies did not intervene in this Spanish Civil War, which was from 1936 to 1939. I wonder if that -- I don't know -- inspires some German aggression throughout the European continent.

And this also does set up authoritarian rule in Spain until the 1970s.

Because I like talking about artistic responses to war, I mean, come on -- Picasso's "Guernica." This highlights the tragedies of war and the impact that it has on regular civilians.

And lastly, let's talk about the Valley of the Fallen. This is actually where Francisco Franco was buried until his body was exhumed in 2019.

Freaking leaders and their monumental architecture to keep their legacy forever. Hey, that's actually like a really neat thing. We can think about the ways that us in the United States are trying to maybe remove some monuments in order to change legacies of leaders.

It's like history connects to itself. Whoa.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.7 Europe During the Interwar Period
If you haven't been paying attention by now, Europe during the interwar period -- this 20-year time period between World War One and World War II -- is not doing great.

Crises that is then exacerbated by the U.S. stock market crash in the 1920s leads to the rise of these powerful totalitarian leaders that promise that they will make their nation strong and great and also will redeem any economic problem that's happening.

Britain and France are trying their best to make sure another war doesn't break out in Europe, and they do this through non-intervention. We see that in the Spanish Civil War.

But then we definitely also see that as Hitler starts to gain and consolidate his power in Germany. The U.S. is like, "Peace, I'm not going to deal with any of that."

So these fascists, unchecked by Western capitalist democracies, start to seize more land. Hitler re-militarizes the Rhineland, takes Austria, and also the Sudetenland.

Meanwhile, Britain and France are like, "Okay, you can do that, Hitler." Which, like, don't do anything else.

The Italian fascists are like, "Great, let's take over Ethiopia."

Meanwhile, Hitler and Stalin were like, "Hey, non-aggression pacts that we can each take part of Poland? Cool."

Appeasement has clearly failed, and World War II breaks out.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.8 World War II
We have arrived at World War II. The AP test actually doesn't really care that you know anything about the battles, which I think is excellent.

They do, however, care that you know how technology and innovation continue to change warfare, and they especially want you to know about blitzkrieg.

Blitzkrieg -- throw everything that you have at your enemies all at once in three waves. Yes, this is very effective and did lead to a lot of Axis victories early on in the war.

But it also is very costly in resources. It's like history repeats itself.

Because of blitzkrieg, France surrendered pretty early on in World War II. Okay.

Also, your history books won't tell you this, but the Nazis totally used a lot of methamphetamines. There are so many good news articles and podcasts out there about this.

Anyway, the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union really did work cooperatively together to try to stop war in Europe. I mean, like, ones that had broken out.

Resistance of civilians, superior military technology, and then also just the commitment to withstanding Hitler's aggression did eventually lead to Allied victories.

Man, all this industrialized warfare, and now there are nukes. It's not going to be good. Yeah.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.9 The Holocaust
In my past few videos, I've been hinting at how these totalitarian leaders gain and consolidate their power. They established these cults of personality, and then they gain their power through four specific methods:

Got censorship, education or re-education, writing or revising history, and propaganda.

But another way to gain and maintain power is through the creation of the "other." And Hitler and his Aryan race of Germans clearly had another in the Jews.

Fueled by anti-Semitism, Nazi Germany sought to create a new racial order in Europe, and this culminates in the Holocaust.

Anti-Semitism is not unique to this time period, and you need to go watch the video that I have about the Dreyfus Affair.

The Nuremberg Laws passed in 1935 started the legal discrimination against Jews in Germany. This only escalated over time into the Holocaust.

Other victims of the Holocaust also include Roma, political dissidents, homosexuals, communists, etc.

I'm sure your teacher has done a good job teaching you about this. If you have any questions, I've been to two concentration camps, and I'm happy to share. So sad.

==== Topics 8.4-8.9 Economic problems, the rise of fascism, the interwar years, WWII, and the Holocaust
Economic effects of World War One -- everything's bad.

The Great Depression forces some people to come up with new economic theories like Keynesian economics, Popular Front parties in France.

Of course, in times of economic crisis, you know what happens -- the rise of totalitarian leaders.

These fascist leaders exploit all the crises that are happening in Europe in order to gain and maintain power using propaganda. They're cultivating their own cults of personality.

Fascism emerges in Spain, Germany, and Italy. And then dictatorships emerge in Eastern Europe. And then also Stalin's over there in the Soviet Union doing his collectivization and his five-year plans and his Great Purges.

Western European powers don't engage in the Spanish Civil War, which is going to give Hitler and Mussolini motivation to keep doing what they want to do.

Hitler re-militarizes the Rhineland and then also annexes Austria. Most fun fact about that is that 99% of Austrians voted for that annexation -- thanks to propaganda.

The Munich Pact is the high point of Western appeasement when these Western powers give Germany the Sudetenland.

Hitler signs the non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union.

World War II happens. Industrialized warfare, blitzkrieg, Operation Barbarossa.

While this is happening, so is the Holocaust.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.10 20th-Century Cultural, Intellectual, and Artistic Developments
In the 1800s, Europeans were like, "Wow, progress is amazing." And then World War One and World War II happen, and Europeans are like, "No, progress is not amazing anymore. It's bad."

Prior to World War One, Europeans thought, "Hey, wow, science is great. Look at all the cool things that we're doing. We have faith in this objective knowledge that we can gain."

That breaks down with advancements in physics. This Newtonian universe is no longer a point of certainty.

And there's a lot of new knowledge and learning when it comes to some of these physicists like Schrödinger, like Heisenberg, and like Enrico Fermi.

The World War One time period is sometimes called The Age of Anxiety.

World War One led to such disillusionment in European society that people didn't know what to put their faith or trust in anymore. Cynicism's on the rise.

And that again only continues through these interwar years and into World War II and definitely into the Cold War.

But while all of that -- all of that is negative, the positive effect of this is that women are now mobilized to do more.

They're involved in economic production. They're involved in serving the military. And they get increasingly involved in politics. So like, one upside, I guess.

==== AP Euro Topic 8.11 Continuity and Changes in an Age of Global Conflict
First summary of Unit 8. I'm going to just straight read off the CED -- Course and Exam Description -- is what your AP teachers are required to teach, and you can Google this because this is exactly what you're going to be tested on on the AP test.

"Total war and political instability in the first half of the 20th century gave way to a polarized state order during the Cold War and eventually to efforts at transnational union."

World War One is bad. The Treaty of Versailles has negative effects. And also, totalitarian leaders rise during the interwar years.

"The stresses of economic collapse and total war engendered internal conflicts within European states and created conflicting conceptions of the relationship between the individual and the state, as demonstrated in the ideological battle between and among democracy, communism, and fascism."

"Diverse intellectual and cultural movements questioned the existence of objective knowledge, the ability of reason to arrive at truth, and the role of religion in determining moral standards."

"Science and physics, demographic changes, economic growth, total war, disruptions of traditional social patterns, and competing definitions of freedom and justice altered the experiences of everyday life."

And everything changes.
