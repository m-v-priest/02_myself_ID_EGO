== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P（Emily P）。咱们来聊聊"新君主制"（new monarchies）吧。 +

**在欧洲的罗马帝国（Roman Empire）覆灭之后，权力变得分散了。权力分散在整个欧洲大陆的许多不同的人手中。没错，天主教会（Catholic Church）起到了粘合剂的作用，**将这片在政治上四分五裂的土地团结在一起，*但总体而言权力是分散的。* +

*由于与贸易重新建立起联系，也由于文艺复兴（Renaissance）的诞生，这种情况开始发生改变。权力再次变得集中，或者说集中到了一小部分人手中——特别是那些拥有财富的人手中。* +

那么他们是如何继续巩固并集中权力的呢？嗯，通过利用宗教，以及在军事方面投入资金。 +

虽然在我们这门课上还没有讲到"新教改革"（Protestant Reformation），但像亨利七世（Henry VII）和他的女儿伊丽莎白（Elizabeth）这样的**英国君主, 利用"新教"（Protestantism）来巩固他们对英格兰（England）的统治。亨利创立了英国国教会（Anglican Church），然后宣称：“我是这个教会的领袖”，所以现在我对我领土内所有英国国教教徒都拥有权力。** +

*在西班牙（Spain）也有类似的发展，那就是西班牙"宗教裁判所"*（Spanish Inquisition）。没错，费迪南德（Ferdinand）和伊莎贝拉（Isabella）**在天主教（Catholicism）的旗帜下, 将西班牙统一成了一个天主教国家，**然后驱逐了犹太人和穆斯林。*如果在你的领土上，每个人都和你信仰相同的宗教，那么你就很容易维持对他们的控制。* +

如果你是一位新君主，试图确立你对那些已经在你的领土上生活了数百年的土地贵族（landed aristocracy）和贵族阶层（nobility）的控制权，你也得想出办法来做到这一点。 +

在英国，亨利设立了"星室法庭"（Star Chambers），这基本上是第一个有组织的法庭，这样他就可以对那些不负责任的贵族进行约束。 +

在整个欧洲，这些新出现的君主们, 继续通过征税, 来维持和巩固他们的权力。*他们征收新税，然后建立起常备军（standing armies）和军事力量，而这些又会——你知道的——增强他们的权力。* +

*但是，当这些拥有土地的传统掌权者——这些统治君主们——存在的时候，一个新的群体出现了，对这种权力发起了挑战。这个群体就是新精英（New Elites）——新兴的富有商人和金融家。* +

嗯，**#决定权力大小的最重要因素, 就是你拥有多少钱。#**没错，虽然这些君主们已经花了几个世纪的时间积累财富，并代代相传，但**像佛罗伦萨（Florence）的美第奇家族（Medici）这样控制着贸易的新贵们, 正在积累大量的财富。** +

随着时间的推移，**他们的财富和影响力, 为他们赢得了更多的政治权力。**我们在荷兰共和国（Dutch Republic）最清楚地看到了这一点，但我们到时候再详细讲那里的情况。 +

*虽然这些君主们利用宗教来增强他们的权力，但总体而言，政治权力仍然在向世俗化（secularization）转变，尤其是在意大利（Italy），在天主教会瓦解之后，这些意大利城邦相互争斗, 以维持自己的权力。* +

不管怎样，同学们，我希望这对你们有帮助。一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about new monarchies.

After the fall of the Roman Empire in Europe, power was decentralized. It was spread out among many different people across the whole continent. Yes, the Catholic Church served as the glue that united this otherwise politically fragmented land together, but power overall was decentralized.

This starts to change as a result of this reconnection to trade and as a result of the birth of the Renaissance. Power becomes centralized or focused again into small groups of people -- specifically people who have wealth.

And how do they continue to consolidate and centralize that power together? Well, using religion and also money in the military.

And while we haven't talked about the Protestant Reformation yet in this class, English monarchs like Henry VII and his daughter Elizabeth use Protestantism to consolidate their control over England. Henry creates the Anglican Church and then says, "I am the head of that church," so now I have power over everyone who is now an Anglican within my lands.

A similar development to this is in Spain with the Spanish Inquisition. Right, Ferdinand and Isabella under the banner of Catholicism unite Spain together as a Catholic nation and then expel Jews and Muslims. If everyone in your lands adheres to a similar religion as you do, it's easy for you to maintain your control over them.

And if you are a new monarch trying to assert your control over -- you know -- landed aristocracy and nobility that had been living in your lands for hundreds of years, you got to figure out a way to do that too.

In England, Henry creates the Star Chambers, which is essentially the first kind of organized court of law so that he can have a check on his irresponsible nobility.

And across Europe, these new monarchs that emerge continue to maintain and consolidate their power through taxation. Their new taxes they then create standing armies and militaries, which again are going to -- you know -- bolster their power.

But while these landed traditional people of power -- these kind of ruling monarchs -- are existing, a new group of people emerges to challenge that power. And these are the New Elites -- the new wealthy merchants and financiers.

Well, the thing that determines power the most is how much money you have. And yes, while these monarchs have had -- you know -- centuries of amassing money and passing it down from family generations, the new people like the Medici in Florence who are controlling trade are gaining a lot of wealth.

And over time, their wealth and their influence then gains them more political power. We see this most clearly play out in the Dutch Republic, but we'll get there when we get there.

And while these monarchs are using religion to bolster their power, overall there is still a shift toward the secularization of political power, especially in Italy where these Italian states are fighting against each other to maintain their power in the wake of the collapse of the Catholic Church.

Anyway students, I hope this helped. And as always, you can do it. I believe in you.
