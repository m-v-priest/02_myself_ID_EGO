Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 5.1, which is contextualizing 把…置于背景中 18th century states 18世纪的国家. +

And because this is our intro video 介绍视频 to a new unit, what I would love to do is really focus on 专注于 the learning objective 学习目标 present here, which is: explain the context 背景 in which European states 欧洲国家 experienced crisis 危机 and conflict 冲突 from 1648 to 1815. +

And I want to break this down 分解 for you looking at three specific themes 主题. Number one is political 政治的 -- hello French Revolution 法国大革命. Number two is cultural and intellectual conflicts 文化和知识冲突, because you know the Scientific Revolution 科学革命 and the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 had just happened. And of course, we got to talk about economic conflicts 经济冲突. +

Let's do this. Let's start out with 从…开始 that political theme 政治主题. We know that the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 started to fuel 激发 new ideas in European society 欧洲社会, and that is going to radically 根本地 alter 改变 political makeup 政治构成 of Europe, starting with 以…开始 the French Revolution 法国大革命. +

For its history -- kind of forever -- in Europe, you had the aristocracy 贵族阶级, the very wealthy landed nobility 富有的土地贵族, and then you had everyone else. And now everyone else -- especially that Third Estate 第三等级, that lower class 下层阶级 in the French social status 法国社会阶层 who were tired and hangry 又累又饿 because they didn't have enough food and also oppressed 受压迫的 because they were paying too much in taxes 纳税过多 -- start to join together 联合起来 to then overthrow 推翻 and topple 颠覆 that traditional ruling class 传统统治阶级. +

But friendly reminder 温馨提示: while we love to focus on 关注 the French Revolution 法国大革命 in AP European History, what other major political revolution 重大政治革命 happened like 150 years prior 之前? Oh, that's right -- the English Civil War 英国内战. +

Something that I would love for you to focus on 关注 in this unit is to evaluate 评估 the extent to which 在何种程度上 the French Revolution 法国大革命 was actually successful 成功. Because I mean, early on 早期, the National Assembly 国民议会 forced 迫使 King Louis XVI 路易十六 to sign a constitution 签署宪法, which technically 从技术层面；实际上 created a constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制. +

But then, you know, Robespierre 罗伯斯庇尔 comes on the scene 登场 and everyone gets beheaded 被斩首. And if we look at the scope 范围 of the French Revolution 法国大革命, you have a monarch 君主 who then becomes a constitutional monarch 君主立宪制君主 who then is beheaded 被斩首, and then France descends into chaos 陷入混乱. +

But then Napoleon 拿破仑 seizes power 夺取政权 and rules as First Consul 第一执政官, but then he declares himself Emperor 称帝 and crowns himself Emperor 为自己加冕, and then tries to take over 征服 all of Europe. And then after all of that, the French nobility 法国贵族 are like, "Hey, what if we just reestablish 重建 the Bourbon monarchy 波旁王朝?" +

As you'll learn, there's a lot of political crisis 政治危机 in this unit, and there's growing conflict 日益加剧的冲突 between two emerging groups of people 新兴群体: the liberals 自由主义者 who want change 变革, and conservatives 保守派 who want to keep things the same 维持现状. +

And quite literally 确实, the French Revolution 法国大革命 was inspired by 受…启发 the cultural and intellectual changes 文化和知识变革 brought about by 由…引起 the Scientific Revolution 科学革命 and the Enlightenment 启蒙运动. Those Enlightenment ideals 启蒙运动的理念 -- especially now that they have had time to simmer 酝酿 and sit in European society 存在于欧洲社会 -- lead to 导致 an increased focus on 更加关注 reason 理性. +

Which also leads to 导致 a fun reactionary response 有趣的反动回应, because you also see the rise of 兴起 Romanticism 浪漫主义, which is a focus on 关注 emotion 情感 and not so much on 不太关注 the logical 逻辑的, reason 理性, empirical knowledge 实证知识. And boy, that expression of emotions and feelings 情感表达 is absolutely felt in the rise of nationalism 民族主义兴起 after Napoleon's attempted conquest of 试图征服 Europe. +

And lastly 最后, economically 经济上 -- well, Britain 英国 is about to ascend 崛起 and be the dominant leader 主导者 in European politics and economics 欧洲政治和经济. Even though by the early 1800s most of the colonies 殖民地 in the Americas 美洲 had successfully fought for their independence 争取独立, there is still a growing worldwide trade network 全球贸易网络. +

And states 国家 like Britain, or like Portugal 葡萄牙, or like the Dutch 荷兰 -- who want to protect their trade network 贸易网络 and keep profiting as much as they possibly can off of that trade network 从贸易网络中尽可能获利 -- are going to get into some conflict 陷入冲突 in order to do that. +

This unit's so fun because it's about the French Revolution 法国大革命 and all the chaos 混乱 that ensues afterwards 随后发生. So buckle up 做好准备, because it's going to get wild 变得疯狂. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题5.1，也就是梳理18世纪各国的时代背景。 +

因为这是我们新单元的介绍视频，我想重点讲解这里的学习目标，即：解释1648年至1815年欧洲各国经历危机和冲突的背景。 +
我想从三个特定主题来剖析这个问题。第一是政治方面——比如法国大革命（French Revolution）。第二是文化和知识方面的冲突，因为大家知道科学革命（Scientific Revolution）和启蒙运动（Enlightenment）刚刚发生。当然，我们还得谈谈经济冲突。 +

我们开始吧。我们从政治主题讲起。我们知道**启蒙运动开始在欧洲社会催生新思想，而这将从法国大革命开始，从根本上改变欧洲的政治构成。** +

在欧洲的历史上——某种程度上一直如此——存在贵族阶层，即非常富有的土地贵族，以及其他所有人。现在，其他所有人——特别是法国社会地位低下的第三等级（Third Estate），他们疲惫不堪又饥肠辘辘，因为他们没有足够的食物，而且还因为缴纳过高的赋税而受到压迫——开始联合起来，推翻那个传统的统治阶级。 +

但温馨提示：虽然在AP欧洲历史课程中我们热衷于关注法国大革命，但150年前还发生了什么重大的政治革命呢？哦，对了——英国内战（English Civil War）。 +

**我希望你们在本单元重点关注的, 是评估"法国大革命"实际上成功的程度。**因为，早期英国国民议会曾迫使路易十六（Louis XVI）签署宪法，从技术层面上建立了"君主立宪制"。 但是，后来罗伯斯庇尔（Robespierre）登场，很多人被斩首。如果我们**审视法国大革命的范围，君主先是变成了"君主立宪制"下的君主，然后被斩首，接着法国陷入了混乱。** +
**然后拿破仑（Napoleon）夺取政权，担任第一执政，但后来他称帝，试图征服整个欧洲。**在这之后，法国贵族们就想：“嘿，如果我们重新建立"波旁王朝"（Bourbon monarchy）会怎样呢？” +

正如你们将学到的，本单元有很多政治危机，而且**两个新兴群体之间的冲突在加剧：想要变革的自由主义者，以及想要维持现状的保守主义者。** +

毫不夸张地说，**法国大革命受到了科学革命和启蒙运动带来的文化和知识变革的启发。**那些启蒙思想——尤其是经过时间沉淀, 在欧洲社会扎根之后——让人们更加注重理性。 +
这也引发了有趣的反动反应，因为**我们看到浪漫主义（Romanticism）兴起，它关注情感，而不是逻辑、理性和实证知识。**而且，在拿破仑试图征服欧洲之后，"民族主义"的兴起中, 绝对能感受到那种情感的表达。 +

最后，**在经济方面——嗯，英国即将崛起，成为欧洲政治和经济的主导者。**尽管在19世纪早期，美洲的大多数殖民地成功地为独立而战，但全球贸易网络仍在不断发展。 +
像英国、葡萄牙，还有荷兰这样的国家——它们想要保护自己的贸易网络，并尽可能从这个贸易网络中获取更多利润——为了实现这一目标，它们会陷入一些冲突。 +

这个单元非常有趣，因为它讲述了法国大革命以及随后发生的所有混乱。所以系好安全带，因为接下来的内容会很精彩。 +
如果需要更多帮助，请跟上讲解，一定要查看我在下面描述中链接的终极复习资料包，因为我为你们准备了很多有用的资源——特别是因为这个单元要涵盖的内容非常多。 +
同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 5.1, which is contextualizing 18th century states.

And because this is our intro video to a new unit, what I would love to do is really focus on the learning objective present here, which is: explain the context in which European states experienced crisis and conflict from 1648 to 1815.

And I want to break this down for you looking at three specific themes. Number one is political -- hello French Revolution. Number two is cultural and intellectual conflicts, because you know the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment had just happened. And of course, we got to talk about economic conflicts.

Let's do this. Let's start out with that political theme. We know that the Enlightenment started to fuel new ideas in European society, and that is going to radically alter political makeup of Europe, starting with the French Revolution.

For its history -- kind of forever -- in Europe, you had the aristocracy, the very wealthy landed nobility, and then you had everyone else. And now everyone else -- especially that Third Estate, that lower class in the French social status who were tired and hangry because they didn't have enough food and also oppressed because they were paying too much in taxes -- start to join together to then overthrow and topple that traditional ruling class.

But friendly reminder: while we love to focus on the French Revolution in AP European History, what other major political revolution happened like 150 years prior? Oh, that's right -- the English Civil War.

Something that I would love for you to focus on in this unit is to evaluate the extent to which the French Revolution was actually successful. Because I mean, early on, the National Assembly forced King Louis XVI to sign a constitution, which technically created a constitutional monarchy.

But then, you know, Robespierre comes on the scene and everyone gets beheaded. And if we look at the scope of the French Revolution, you have a monarch who then becomes a constitutional monarch who then is beheaded, and then France descends into chaos.

But then Napoleon seizes power and rules as First Consul, but then he declares himself Emperor and crowns himself Emperor, and then tries to take over all of Europe. And then after all of that, the French nobility are like, "Hey, what if we just reestablish the Bourbon monarchy?"

As you'll learn, there's a lot of political crisis in this unit, and there's growing conflict between two emerging groups of people: the liberals who want change, and conservatives who want to keep things the same.

And quite literally, the French Revolution was inspired by the cultural and intellectual changes brought about by the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. Those Enlightenment ideals -- especially now that they have had time to simmer and sit in European society -- lead to an increased focus on reason.

Which also leads to a fun reactionary response, because you also see the rise of Romanticism, which is a focus on emotion and not so much on the logical, reason, empirical knowledge. And boy, that expression of emotions and feelings is absolutely felt in the rise of nationalism after Napoleon's attempted conquest of Europe.

And lastly, economically -- well, Britain is about to ascend and be the dominant leader in European politics and economics. Even though by the early 1800s most of the colonies in the Americas had successfully fought for their independence, there is still a growing worldwide trade network.

And states like Britain, or like Portugal, or like the Dutch -- who want to protect their trade network and keep profiting as much as they possibly can off of that trade network -- are going to get into some conflict in order to do that.

This unit's so fun because it's about the French Revolution and all the chaos that ensues afterwards. So buckle up, because it's going to get wild.

So follow along if you need more help, and definitely check out my Ultimate Review Packet linked in the description below, because I have so many helpful resources for you -- especially because there's just so much to cover in this unit.

But as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.
