== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。关于第二单元“宗教改革时代”，有四件事你们需要了解。 +

第一：**新教改革（Protestant Reformation）导致了欧洲宗教统一的分裂。**它使天主教会（Catholic Church）产生了分裂，导致了新教教派（Protestant denominations）的兴起，你们一定要了解一些像马丁·路德（Martin Luther）和约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）这样的宗教改革者。 +

第二：作为对新教改革的回应，天主教改革（Catholic Reformation），也就是反宗教改革（Counter-Reformation）在特伦托会议（Council of Trent）上展开。天主教当局齐聚一堂，通过发布《禁书目录》（Index of Prohibited Books）等方式重申天主教教义，同时通过创建像"耶稣会"（Jesuits）这样的修会让人们重新回归信仰。 +

第三：**天主教徒和新教徒之间的这场冲突, 在欧洲引发了宗教战争。**它发生在法国宗教战争（French Wars of Religion）中，发生在荷兰共和国（Dutch Republic）与西班牙的战斗中，发生在英国亨利八世（Henry VIII）创立英国国教会（Anglican Church）的过程中，也发生在**中欧的三十年战争（Thirty Years' War）中——这场战争基本上是哈布斯堡家族（Habsburgs）与非哈布斯堡家族之间的战争。** +

第四：**这些宗教战争, 产生了巨大的社会和政治影响。政治权力发生了转移，君主权力削弱，诸侯权力增强。**社会角色也发生了变化——你们知道的，当时**新教徒认为男女应该平等，**那么我们该如何看待女性的角色呢？教会中女性角色的变化, 以及对巫术的指控不断增多。 +

虽然《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia）确实带来了欧洲更多的宗教宽容，也结束了那个时期困扰欧洲的宗教战争，但很多人也开始放弃宗教信仰。*所有这些宗教纷争、所有这些宗教战争, 导致了世俗主义（secularism）、自然神论（deism）的兴起，最终导致了无神论（atheism）的出现。* +

我希望这些内容能帮到你们，如果这些对你们来说还不够，一定要查看我的终极复习资料包，因为我为AP欧洲历史的每个单元都准备了学习指南和技能练习。 +

一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Number two: In response to the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Reformation or the Counter-Reformation occurred at the Council of Trent.

Number four: These religious wars had drastic social and political effects. There's shifting political power with monarchs losing power and princes gaining power. There's shifting societal roles of -- you know -- what do we do about women now if Protestants think that men and women should be treated equally at the time? Changing societal roles about the role of women in the church and the rise of witchcraft accusations.

And while the Peace of Westphalia did lead to more religious toleration in Europe and did end the wars of religion that plagued that time period, a lot of people also just kind of started to abandon religion. All of this religious strife, all of these religious wars led to a rise of secularism, deism, and eventually atheism.
