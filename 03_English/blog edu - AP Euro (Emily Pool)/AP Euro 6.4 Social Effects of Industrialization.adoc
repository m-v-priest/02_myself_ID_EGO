Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 6.4: Social Effects of Industrialization 工业化的社会影响. +

Look, for all of human history, you essentially 本质上 had the people with power and the people without power. And industrialization 工业化 really changes that because you have this new emerging middle class 新兴中产阶级. +

And what is this new emerging middle class concerned with 关心 doing? Proving that they're no longer in the lower class 下层阶级. Yeah, the wealthy 富有的 are always going to be wealthy, right? The aristocratic landowners 贵族地主 then became essentially 本质上 the factory owners 工厂主, so that is a continuity 延续性 -- the rich people always having money. +

But now you have the ability to make more money due to 由于 trade 贸易 and due to industrialization 工业化. So that emerging middle class has a higher disposable income 可支配收入 than they've had before, and they want to show to the upper class 上层阶级 and also to the lower class that they are no longer a part of that. +

What I'm alluding to 暗示 here, students, is the rise of self-conscious social classes 有自我意识的社会阶层. There is now a clearly defined 明确界定的 upper class 上层阶级, a clearly defined bourgeoisie 资产阶级 or middle class, and a clearly defined proletariat 无产阶级 or working class 工人阶级. +

And how is this new bourgeoisie 资产阶级 going to prove that they have more money than other people? Well, through how they spend it -- just like we kind of still do today. +

Due to 由于 higher wages 更高的工资 and lower working hours 更短的工作时间, there emerge 出现 new social organizations 社会组织 and also leisure activities 休闲活动 that people can now be a part of. You wanted to be hot stuff 了不起的人物 in the 1800s if you're in this bourgeoisie class? What are you going to do? You're going to go to the theater 剧院 or maybe the opera 歌剧, or maybe you'll get seen in a fancy seat 豪华座位 at a new sporting club 体育俱乐部. +

Not only that, but the middle and upper class also participated in 参与 philanthropic activities 慈善活动 -- which is giving back 回馈社会, charity 慈善 if you will. If you've taken US history, this is that Gospel of Wealth 财富福音, Andrew Carnegie 安德鲁·卡内基 idea. +

If you're in the proletariat 无产阶级 -- the working class 工人阶级 -- you are also joining together 联合起来 through the forms of labor unions 工会, and you are fighting for 争取 more rights 更多权利 to protect those in the working class. Things like the Factory Act of 1833 1833年工厂法 or the Ten Hours Act of 1847 1847年十小时工作法 all tried to protect the rights of women and children working in the factories 工厂中工作的妇女和儿童的权利 and set better wages 工资 and working hours 工作时间 for those who were also working in the factories. +

All of what I just said is true for Northwestern Europe 西北欧 and not necessarily for Southeastern Europe 东南欧, where industrialization 工业化 hadn't entirely taken root 扎根 yet. That land is still dominated by 由…主导 agricultural elites 农业精英 and that traditional social hierarchy 传统社会等级制度 of the people with money and the people without money. +

But concomitant with 与…相伴的是 industrialization is urbanization 城市化. So as industrialization spreads across Europe, more people are moving to cities to find jobs 找工作, which weakens rural communities 农村社区 who are now out of labor 缺乏劳动力. +

These new bourgeoisie families 资产阶级家庭, in order to 为了 prove that they're in the bourgeoisie 资产阶级, decide that they want to really adopt 采用 traditional strict gender roles 严格的传统性别角色 in order to "protect" the women. This continues the rise of the Cult of Domesticity 家庭崇拜, which says that a woman's place is in the house 女人的位置在家里 -- not in the outside dirty world, but it's in the home to protect the kids 在家照顾孩子. +

Men are the ones who go work 外出工作, and they make enough money that the women don't need to go work, so the women can just have a great time at home. +

Speaking of 说到 marriages 婚姻, there emerges a shift 转变 in actually marrying for love 为爱情而结婚 among the working class 工人阶级 because they are kind of all in it together 同舟共济. If you were in the middle class 中产阶级 or the upper class 上层阶级, yes, there's still economic motivations 经济动机 of who you're going to marry because you know that's going to bolster 提升 your social status 社会地位. +

But if you're solidly in the working class 坚定地属于工人阶级, you're just going to marry someone else who's solidly in the working class, and then you're going to have like a lovely marriage together -- hopefully. +

While the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 had disastrous short-term consequences 灾难性的短期后果, by the end of the 1800s things were actually better for the average person 普通人 -- spending fewer hours working in a factory 工厂工作时间减少 for higher wages 获得更高工资. +

You also now have more access to 更容易获得 things like birth control 避孕措施, so you can determine how you want to live your life 决定如何生活. And social welfare programs 社会福利项目 and an improved diet 改善的饮食 all help out 帮助 those who were traditionally very hurt by the Industrial Revolution 传统上受工业革命伤害严重的人. +

Even by the end of the 1800s, that working class 工人阶级 could now participate in 参与 some of these new leisure activities 休闲活动 like parks 公园 and amusement parks 游乐园 and operas 歌剧 and theaters 剧院. +

Students, what I would love for you to do with a friend right now -- or maybe even in your class -- is to discuss 讨论: evaluate the extent to which 在何种程度上 the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 was a positive development 积极发展 for the world. +

This would be a really great time to practice that counterargument 反驳论点 or a counterclaim 反主张 in your actual discussion. Yeah, it was bad in these ways, but ultimately it was good in these ways. Or the short-term consequences were negative, but the long-term consequences were positive. +

As always, students, you can do it. I believe in you. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题6.4：工业化的社会影响。 +

听着，在整个人类历史上，基本上存在"有权势的人"和"没有权势的人"。而工业化真正改变了这种状况，因为出现了新兴的中产阶级。 +
这个新兴的中产阶级关心做什么呢？证明他们不再属于下层阶级。是的，富人总是会富有，对吧？贵族地主基本上变成了工厂主，所以这是一种延续——富人总是有钱。 +

但现在，由于贸易和工业化，人们有能力赚更多的钱。所以这个新兴的中产阶级, 拥有比以前更高的可支配收入，他们想向上层阶级和下层阶级展示，他们不再是下层阶级的一部分。 +
同学们，我在这里暗示的是自觉的社会阶级的兴起。*现在有了明确界定的上层阶级、明确界定的资产阶级或中产阶级，以及明确界定的无产阶级或工人阶级。* +

这个新的资产阶级, 要如何证明他们比其他人更有钱呢？嗯，通过他们花钱的方式——就像我们现在某种程度上仍然做的那样。 +
由于工资提高、工作时间减少，出现了新的社会组织，人们也有了可以参与的休闲活动。如果你在19世纪属于资产阶级，想要成为时尚人士？你会怎么做呢？你会去剧院，或者去看歌剧，又或者你会出现在新的体育俱乐部的豪华座位上。 +
不仅如此，中上层阶级还参与慈善活动——也就是回馈社会、做慈善。如果你学过美国历史，这就像安德鲁·卡内基（Andrew Carnegie）的“财富福音”理念。 +

**如果你属于无产阶级——工人阶级——你也会通过"工会"的形式联合起来，为保护工人阶级的更多权利而斗争。**像1833年的《工厂法》（Factory Act of 1833）或1847年的《十小时法案》（Ten Hours Act of 1847）都试图保护在工厂工作的妇女和儿童的权利，并为在工厂工作的人, 设定更好的工资和工作时间。 +

**我刚才说的这些主要适用于西北欧，而东南欧不一定是这样，因为工业化在东南欧还没有完全扎根。**在东南欧，仍然是农业精英以及有钱人和没钱人的传统社会等级制度, 占主导。 +

但**与工业化相伴而来的是城市化。**所以随着工业化在欧洲的传播，更多的人搬到城市找工作，*这使得农村社区的劳动力流失，社区被削弱。* +

这些新的资产阶级家庭，为了证明他们属于资产阶级，决定真正采用传统严格的性别角色来“保护”女性。这使得“家庭崇拜”（Cult of Domesticity）进一步兴起，这种观念认为女性的位置是在家里——不在外面那个肮脏的世界，而是在家里照顾孩子。 +
男人出去工作，他们赚的钱足够让女人不用去工作，所以女人可以在家里享受美好的时光。 +

说到婚姻，工人阶级中出现了一种"为了爱情而结婚"的转变，因为他们在某种程度上是同命运的。*如果你属于中产阶级或上层阶级，没错，在选择结婚对象时仍然有经济方面的考量，因为你知道这会提升你的社会地位(资源交换, 门当户对, 结婚不是扶贫, 谁也不吃亏.)。* +
但如果你坚定地属于工人阶级，你会和同样属于工人阶级的人结婚，然后你们可能会拥有一段美好的婚姻——希望如此。 +

*虽然工业革命在短期内带来了灾难性的后果，但到19世纪末，普通人的生活实际上变好了——工作时间减少，工资提高。* +
现在人们也有了更多获得"节育措施"的机会，所以你可以决定自己想要的生活方式。社会福利项目和饮食的改善, 都帮助了那些在传统上受到工业革命伤害的人。 +
即使到了19世纪末，工人阶级现在也可以参与一些新的休闲活动，比如公园、游乐园、歌剧和剧院。 +

同学们，我希望你们现在和朋友一起，或者在课堂上做的是：*评估"工业革命"对世界来说,在多大程度上是一个积极的发展。* +
这是在实际讨论中, 练习提出相反观点的好时机。没错，**它在某些方面很糟糕，但最终在某些方面是好的。**或者说，短期后果是负面的，但长期后果是积极的。 +

如果你在这样的技能练习方面, 需要更多帮助，一定要查看我在下面描述中链接的终极复习资料包。 +
同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 6.4: Social Effects of Industrialization.

Look, for all of human history, you essentially had the people with power and the people without power. And industrialization really changes that because you have this new emerging middle class.

And what is this new emerging middle class concerned with doing? Proving that they're no longer in the lower class. Yeah, the wealthy are always going to be wealthy, right? The aristocratic landowners were then became essentially the factory owners, so that is a continuity -- the rich people always having money.

But now you have the ability to make more money due to trade and due to industrialization. So that emerging middle class has a higher disposable income than they've had before, and they want to show to the upper class and also to the lower class that they are no longer a part of that.

What I'm alluding to here, students, is the rise of self-conscious social classes. There is now a clearly defined upper class, a clearly defined bourgeoisie or middle class, and a clearly defined proletariat or working class.

And how is this new bourgeoisie going to prove that they have more money than other people? Well, through how they spend it -- just like we kind of still do today.

Due to higher wages and lower working hours, there emerge new social organizations and also leisure activities that people can now be a part of. You wanted to be hot stuff in the 1800s if you're in this bourgeoisie class? What are you going to do? You're going to go to the theater or maybe the opera, or maybe you'll get seen in a fancy seat at a new sporting club.

Not only that, but the middle and upper class also participated in philanthropic activities -- which is giving back, charity if you will. If you've taken US history, this is that Gospel of Wealth, Andrew Carnegie idea.

If you're in the proletariat -- the working class -- you are also joining together through the forms of labor unions, and you are fighting for more rights to protect those in the working class. Things like the Factory Act of 1833 or the Ten Hours Act of 1847 all tried to protect the rights of women and children working in the factories and set better wages and working hours for those who were also working in the factories.

All of what I just said is true for Northwestern Europe and not necessarily for Southeastern Europe, where industrialization hadn't entirely taken root yet. That land is still dominated by agricultural elites and that traditional social hierarchy of the people with money and the people without money.

But concomitant with industrialization is urbanization. So as industrialization spreads across Europe, more people are moving to cities to find jobs, which weakens rural communities who are now out of labor.

These new bourgeoisie families, in order to prove that they're in the bourgeoisie, decide that they want to really adopt traditional strict gender roles in order to "protect" the women. This continues the rise of the Cult of Domesticity, which says that a woman's place is in the house -- not in the outside dirty world, but it's in the home to protect the kids.

Men are the ones who go work, and they make enough money that the women don't need to go work, so the women can just have a great time at home.

Speaking of marriages, there emerges a shift in actually marrying for love among the working class because they are kind of all in it together. If you were in the middle class or the upper class, yes, there's still economic motivations of who you're going to marry because you know that's going to bolster your social status.

But if you're solidly in the working class, you're just going to marry someone else who's solidly in the working class, and then you're going to have like a lovely marriage together -- hopefully.

While the Industrial Revolution had disastrous short-term consequences, by the end of the 1800s things were actually better for the average person -- spending fewer hours working in a factory for higher wages.

You also now have more access to things like birth control, so you can determine how you want to live your life. And social welfare programs and an improved diet all help out those who were traditionally very hurt by the Industrial Revolution.

Even by the end of the 1800s, that working class could now participate in some of these new leisure activities like parks and amusement parks and operas and theaters.

Students, what I would love for you to do with a friend right now -- or maybe even in your class -- is to discuss: evaluate the extent to which the Industrial Revolution was a positive development for the world.

This would be a really great time to practice that counterargument or a counterclaim in your actual discussion. Yeah, it was bad in these ways, but ultimately it was good in these ways. Or the short-term consequences were negative, but the long-term consequences were positive.
