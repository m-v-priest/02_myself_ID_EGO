Hey P students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about the printing press 印刷机.
 + 

In my brain students, there are three things -- three things in the world that have drastically 彻底地；激烈地 altered 改变；变更 all of human history.
 + 

Number one: the Neolithic Revolution 新石器时代革命. I mean, farming 农业；耕作 -- come on, I'll give you that.
 + 

Number two: the Industrial Revolution 工业革命. I mean, making things by machines -- mass production 大规模生产 -- I'll give you that.
 + 

Number three: the printing press.
 + 

So if your teacher is like me in class, you were not allowed to use computers. You have to handwrite 手写 everything. You know how long that takes?
 + 

Do you know that before the printing press, every single piece of literature 文学作品 that was created had to be handwritten? And then had to be handwritten handwritten?
 + 

Students, if we're looking back at old school scriptoria 抄写室；缮写室 in the Middle Ages, it looks just like a classroom. There is a monk 僧侣；修道士 in the front of the class reading his Bible 圣经, and as he is doing that, all of the students in his class are writing down word for word 逐字地 what he's saying. And that's how we created books.
 + 

So when movable type 活字印刷 was first created in Korea and then made its way via 通过 the Silk Roads 丝绸之路 over to Europe, and Johan Gutenberg got this and was like, "This is a great idea. What if I just make some little adjustments 调整；修改 and turn it into a printing press?"
 + 

Game changer 改变游戏规则的事物 students. It led to 导致 the democratization 民主化 of learning. And what I mean by that is now more people -- the people, the demos 民众 -- have access to 有机会接触；有权利使用 learning in a way that they couldn't before.
 + 

If you are only producing, let's say, 100 Bibles a year, can you imagine how expensive that would be? But now that you can mass produce 大量生产 books, things become way cheaper, and the public 公众 can get access to all of these new pieces of literature that are being produced.
 + 

The invention of printing promoted 促进；推动 the dissemination 传播；散布 of new ideas and increased literacy 读写能力. And not only that, but you can actually start to now read and write in your own vernacular 白话的；本国语的 language versus 与……相比 just Latin 拉丁语.
 + 

The fact that now people are able to read and write in their vernacular also contributes to 有助于；促成 the development of new national identities 民族认同. This is what it means to be Italian and read Italian literature. This is what it means to be German and read German literature.
 + 

We love the printing press. We are grateful for 感激 Johan Gutenberg's contributions to 对……的贡献 human society.
 + 

Also, my most fun fact about the printing press: you know how we have like uppercase letters 大写字母 and lowercase letters 小写字母 -- capital 大写的 and regular 普通的；常规的? That's because the case -- the briefcase 公文包 that these letters were held in -- the capital letters were in the upper part of the case, the lowercase letters were in the lower part of the case, and that's where we get that from.
 + 

H, I hope this helped. And as always, you can do it. I believe in you.

== 中文释义

嘿，学预修课程（P）的同学们，我是艾米丽·P（Emily P）。咱们来聊聊印刷机（printing press）吧。 +

同学们，在我看来，*世界上有三样东西——有三样东西极大地改变了整个人类历史。* +

第一样：新石器时代革命（Neolithic Revolution）。我是说，*农耕*——得了吧，这点我承认。 +

第二样：*工业革命*（Industrial Revolution）。我是说，*用机器制造东西——大规模生产*——这点我也承认。 +

第三样：*印刷机。* +

所以，如果你们的老师像我在课堂上这样，你们是不被允许使用电脑的。你们必须手写所有东西。你们知道那得花多长时间吗？ +

你们知道在印刷机出现之前，每一部创作出来的文学作品都得手写吗？而且还得一遍又一遍地手写？ +

同学们，如果我们回顾**中世纪那些古老的抄写室**（scriptoria），它们看起来就像一间教室。*在教室前面有一个僧侣在阅读他的《圣经》（Bible），当他在阅读的时候，他课堂上的所有学生都在逐字逐句地写下他说的话。以前我们就是这样制作书籍的。* +

所以，当活字印刷术（movable type）最早在朝鲜被发明出来，然后经由丝绸之路（Silk Roads）传到了欧洲，约翰内斯·古腾堡（Johan Gutenberg）接触到了这个技术，他就想：“这是个好主意。要是我做一些小调整，把它变成一台印刷机怎么样？” +

这可是个改变游戏规则的发明啊，同学们。它带来了学习的民主化（democratization of learning）。我的意思是，现在更多的人——普通大众（the people, the demos），能够以一种他们以前无法做到的方式接触到知识。 +

比如说，*如果你们一年只生产100本《圣经》，你们能想象那得有多贵吗？但是现在你们能够大规模生产书籍了，东西变得便宜多了，公众能够接触到所有这些新创作出来的文学作品。* +

**印刷术的发明促进了新思想的传播，提高了识字率（literacy）。**不仅如此，*现在你们实际上可以开始用自己的本国语言（vernacular language）进行读写了，而不只是用拉丁语（Latin）。* +

**现在人们能够用自己的本国语言进行读写，这一事实也促进了新的民族认同感的发展。**这就是身为意大利人并阅读意大利文学作品的意义所在。这就是身为德国人并阅读德国文学作品的意义所在。 +

我们热爱印刷机。我们感激约翰内斯·古腾堡对人类社会所做出的贡献。 +

还有，关于印刷机我知道的最有趣的事实是：你们知道我们有大写字母（uppercase letters）和小写字母（lowercase letters ，也就是大写（capital）和普通形式的字母）吧？那是因为装这些字母的箱子——装字母的公文包，大写字母放在箱子的上面部分，小写字母放在箱子的下面部分，我们就是这么来区分大小写字母的。 +

嘿，我希望这对你们有帮助。一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +
