Hey students, it's Emily Pool. Let's talk about Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation 新教改革.
 +
In order to contextualize 提供背景；将……置于背景中 the Protestant Reformation, we have to start by talking about the Catholic Church 天主教会. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Catholic Church filled the political void 政治真空 that existed in Europe, and a lot of people became united by their shared common Catholic faith 天主教信仰.
 +
The Catholic Church also had a monopoly over 垄断 education. The majority of the people who were literate 有读写能力的 were either the elites 精英 already in European society or people who worked for the church. Bibles were not common because, prior to 在……之前 the printing press, everything was extraordinarily 极其地 expensive to produce, which means that the leaders within the church were the ones reading and interpreting 解释 scripture 经文 on behalf of 代表 the congregation 会众.
 +
The Catholic Church taught that salvation 救赎 -- being made right before a holy God, the forgiveness of sins 赦免罪孽, access into heaven 进入天堂, and eternity with God forever 与上帝永恒同在 -- was achieved by good works 善行 and by faith 信仰. And not only that, but by the 1500s, there was more increased corruption 腐败 within the Catholic Church through the practice of simony 买卖圣职 -- or giving out church positions to the higher bidder 出价更高者 -- and also the sale of indulgences 赎罪券.
 +
An indulgence 赎罪券 was a certificate 证书 that was granted by the pope 教皇 that allowed the purchaser 购买者 to pay for a lesser time in purgatory 炼狱 for themselves or for a loved one. At this point, a lot of Catholics also believed in purgatory, which means after you die, you're in kind of this holding area 暂存区 before you go to heaven or before you go to hell 地狱.
 +
So in purchasing an indulgence -- whose cost depended on how wealthy you were in society in general -- you, in theory 理论上, would alleviate 减轻 or lessen the time that someone was spending in purgatory. Some people talk about this as like a "get out of hell free" card, and that is not entirely correct. It's more of a "paying for forgiveness of sins" card.
 +
Hey, and why was the Catholic Church advocating for 提倡 the sale of indulgences in the early 1500s? Well, let me introduce you to one of my most favorite historical characters: Julius II.
 +
Pope Julius II was living at the Vatican 梵蒂冈, and Pope Julius II said, "Hey, you know what would be really cool? If we bedazzled 装饰；使光彩夺目 this a little bit more to show off 炫耀 the power of the Catholic Church." Like, you know, asking Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel 西斯廷教堂 or, by the way, asking Raphael to paint the School of Athens 雅典学院.
 +
This idea of bedazzling the pope's home in order to establish the Catholic dominance 统治 in Europe then continued with the next pope, Pope Leo the 10th. Pope Leo the 10th actively raised indulgences so that he could finish construction on St. Peter's Basilica 圣彼得大教堂, and he did this through one of his friends, Johan Tetzel.
 +
In 1517, Martin Luther sees Johan Tetzel selling indulgences and says, "Huh, in my study of the scriptures, I don't think that paying for forgiveness of sins is actually what the Bible says."
 +
Martin Luther specifically cites 引用 one of Paul's letters to the Ephesians that says, "For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is a gift of God, not of yourselves, not by works, so that no one can boast."
 +
This becomes Martin Luther's rallying cry 战斗口号 that salvation is through faith alone 因信称义 -- or sola fide （拉丁语：唯独信仰）. Martin Luther raged against 愤怒反对 Johan Tetzel and, according to him, his misconstruction 曲解 of the word of God.
 +
So Martin Luther then writes down 95 critiques 批评意见 that he has about the Catholic Church and their corruption. Historians think he then nailed 钉；固定 it onto the church door at Wittenberg -- which honestly sounds way more dramatic than it actually was.
 +
This was just the place that people would come to learn about things. Think about it as like a modern-day billboard 广告牌 -- I don't even know that that's relevant anymore. Think about it as a modern-day TikTok where he just posts a video about 95 critiques he has about the most powerful, strongest institution 机构 in Europe at the time.
 +
And thanks to 多亏；由于 the printing press, these 95 Theses 九十五条论纲 become widely circulated 广泛传播 in the vernacular 白话；本国语 around Europe, and this begins the new Protestant belief 新教信仰 -- which, by the way, "Protestant Reformation," the root words 词根 are "protest" 抗议 and "reform" 改革. Martin Luther is actually trying to reform the church from within 从内部 and, you know, ended up starting a whole new version of Christianity 基督教.
 +
Shared Protestant beliefs 新教共同信仰 that you need to know about: Number one is sola fide -- or salvation through faith alone. Number two is that the Bible is the only authority 权威 for Christians in their life. It is not a pope, it is not a bishop 主教. You should read the Bible on your own because the Bible is the word of God.
 +
Don't have other people interpret it for you because they could misinterpret 误解 it. This itself -- the fact that Martin Luther is advocating for 提倡 people to get their own Bibles and read the Bible on their own -- again leads to the rise of literacy 读写能力 in Europe during this time.
 +
And if we're going to get really into the weeds 深入细节 here about Christian practices 基督教仪式, Martin Luther said that there are actually only two sacraments 圣礼 that a believer needs to practice. The Catholic Church said that there are seven sacraments. Martin Luther says that the only ones that matter are baptism 洗礼 and communion 圣餐.
 +
Another key Protestant belief is this idea of the priesthood of all believers 信徒皆祭司. So if you look at the Roman Catholic Church, there was a very clear social hierarchy 社会等级制度 that placed the pope at the top, and these Protestant reformers are saying, "Actually, Jesus in the Bible says that we are all equal together, and there shouldn't be any one person in charge of other people."
 +
Oh, and this contributes to 促成 one of my favorite continuities 连续性 that is strung throughout 贯穿 the AP European History curriculum 课程: the debate about women. If we're reading in the Bible that everyone is equal before the Lord, what does that mean about women and women's roles in society?
 +
Another early reformer 改革者 that you do need to know about is a guy named John Calvin. John Calvin is often neglected 被忽视 when we talk about Protestantism 新教 in a big global view, but he was almost equally as important as Martin Luther.
 +
John Calvin was French but then lived in Geneva 日内瓦, and John Calvin started what became Calvinism 加尔文主义. He continued Martin Luther's same Protestant beliefs with two exceptions 例外.
 +
Number one: He believed in the idea of predestination 预定论. Quoting 引用 Romans 8:29 - 30, John Calvin said that God has predestined 预定 before the foundations of the world who would be saved and who would not be saved.
 +
It's going to radically 根本地 impact a lot of Christian belief in general and lead to more conflict because he's essentially saying a limited number of souls that God has already chosen before one is born will be able to access eternity with God in heaven forever.
 +
The second thing that you need to know about John Calvin is that he believed if you worked very hard, God would reward 奖励 your hard work through wealth 财富. This idea of a prosperity gospel 成功神学 or the Protestant work ethic 新教伦理 definitely took root in 扎根于 the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国, and I got to say, the Dutch became very wealthy.
 +
So while Martin Luther and John Calvin spearheaded 带头 this new Protestant Reformation in the early 1500s, they would not have been able to do this without the reformers who came before them like Desiderius Erasmus, John Wycliffe, and Jan Hus, and their advocation 提倡 that one should read the Bible on their own.
 +
This led to a myriad of 大量的 new Christian denominations 基督教教派 because people are now reading the scripture 经文 on their own and then interpreting it on their own, which leads to different interpretations of what God is saying.
 +
Y'all, the one thing that Catholics, Lutherans 路德宗信徒, and Calvinists 加尔文主义者 could all agree on is that the Anabaptists 再洗礼派 were real weird. Anabaptists argued for 主张 a complete separation of church and state 政教分离 and then refused to participate in 参与 secular affairs 世俗事务 like paying taxes 纳税 and voting 投票.
 +
Not only that, but they disagreed with infant baptism 婴儿洗礼. They said that you should only be able to make the choice if you want to be a Christian and be baptized when your brain is fully formed.
 +
So these Anabaptists emerged as a radical 激进的 Protestant group that the rest of the Christian world in Europe did not align with 与……一致 or agree with.
 +
So we have some new Christian denominations on the scene, and they're all living very closely together in a very small Europe, and I wonder if this is going to, I don't know, cause any conflicts? We'll get to it next time.

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·普尔（Emily Pool）。咱们来聊聊马丁·路德（Martin Luther）和新教改革（the Protestant Reformation）吧。 +

为了解"新教改革"的背景，我们得先谈谈天主教会（the Catholic Church）。**罗马帝国（Roman Empire）覆灭后，**天主教会填补了欧洲存在的政治空白，许多人因共同的天主教信仰而团结在一起。 +

**天主教会还垄断了教育。**大多数识字的人要么是欧洲社会的精英，要么是为教会工作的人。*《圣经》并不常见，因为在印刷机出现之前，所有东西的制作成本都极其高昂，这意味着教会的领袖们代表会众阅读和解释经文。* +

天主教会教导说，救赎——在神圣的上帝面前被称义、罪得赦免、得以进入天堂并永远与上帝同在——是通过善行和信仰实现的。不仅如此，*到16世纪，天主教会内部的腐败现象愈发严重，比如买卖圣职（simony）——也就是把教会职位卖给出价最高的人(即买官)——以及出售赎罪券（sale of indulgences）。* +

*赎罪券是教皇授予的一种证书，购买者可以为自己或所爱的人支付费用，从而在炼狱（purgatory）中待更短的时间。在那个时候，许多天主教徒也相信炼狱的存在，这意味着人死后，在进入天堂或地狱之前，会在一个特定的地方停留。* +

所以购买赎罪券——其费用取决于你在社会中的富裕程度——理论上，你可以减轻或缩短某人在炼狱里的时间。有些人把这说成是一张 “免下地狱” 的卡片，但这种说法并不完全正确。它更像是一张 “赎罪券”。 +

嘿，那么在16世纪早期，天主教会为什么要提倡出售赎罪券呢？嗯，让我给你们介绍一个我最喜欢的历史人物：尤利乌斯二世（Julius II）。 +

教皇尤利乌斯二世住在梵蒂冈（Vatican），他说：“嘿，你们知道什么很酷吗？如果我们把这里装饰得更华丽一些，就能彰显天主教会的权力。” 比如，他让米开朗基罗（Michelangelo）绘制西斯廷教堂（Sistine Chapel）的壁画，顺便说一下，他还让拉斐尔（Raphael）绘制了《雅典学院》（the School of Athens）。 +

**为了确立天主教在欧洲的主导地位，教皇们都想把教皇的住所装饰得更加华丽，**这种想法在教皇利奥十世（Pope Leo the 10th）时期得以延续。**教皇利奥十世积极推行赎罪券的售卖，这样他就能完成圣彼得大教堂（St. Peter's Basilica）的建造，**他通过自己的一位朋友约翰·台彻尔（Johan Tetzel）来做这件事。 +

1517年，**马丁·路德**看到约翰·台彻尔在售卖赎罪券，他**说：“嗯，根据我对经文的研究，我认为花钱赎罪实际上并不符合《圣经》的教义。”** +

马丁·路德特别引用了保罗写给以弗所人的一封信中的话：“*#你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信。这并不是出于自己，乃是上帝所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸 (这就是说取消了人的主观能动性了? 变成了血统论一样的, 信者得永生)。#*” +

这成为了**#马丁·路德的战斗口号，即"救赎只通过信仰（sola fide）实现"。#**马丁·路德强烈反对约翰·台彻尔，在他看来，台彻尔曲解了上帝的话语。 +

于是马丁·路德写下了他对天主教会及其腐败现象的95条批判。历史学家认为，他把这些批判钉在了维滕贝格（Wittenberg）的教堂门上——老实说，这听起来比实际情况要戏剧性得多。 +

教堂门就像是一个人们获取信息的地方。可以把它想象成现代的广告牌——我甚至不知道这个比喻是否还恰当。也可以把它想象成现代的TikTok，马丁·路德在上面发布了他对当时欧洲最强大、最有影响力的机构（天主教会）的95条批判。 +

*多亏了印刷机，这些《九十五条论纲》（95 Theses）以当地语言在欧洲广泛传播，这开启了新的新教信仰*——顺便说一下，**“新教改革（Protestant Reformation）” 这个词的词根是 “抗议（protest）” 和 “改革（reform）”。**马丁·路德实际上是试图从教会内部进行改革，*结果却开创了基督教的一个全新版本 (全新阐释版本)。* +

*##有一些新教的共同信仰，##你们需要了解：#第一点是"因信称义"（sola fide）——即只通过信仰获得救赎。第二点是《圣经》是基督徒生活中唯一的权威。不是教皇，也不是主教。你应该自己阅读《圣经》，因为《圣经》是上帝的话语。#* +

*##不要让别人为你解释《圣经》，因为他们可能会误解它。马丁·路德倡导人们拥有自己的《圣经》并自己阅读《圣经》 (强调自学, 自我领悟, 而非灌输)，##这本身又促进了当时欧洲识字率的提高。* +

如果我们深入探讨基督教的实践，*马丁·路德说，信徒实际上只需要践行两项圣礼。而天主教会则认为有七项圣礼。马丁·路德说，重要的只有洗礼（baptism）和圣餐（communion）。* +

*##新教的另一个关键信仰是 “信徒皆祭司(人人皆兄弟, 而非有高下之分)” 的理念。##所以，看看##罗马天主教会##（Roman Catholic Church），那里##有一个非常明确的社会等级制度，教皇处于最高位置，而这些新教改革者说：“实际上，《圣经》里的耶稣说我们都是平等的，不应该有某一个人来掌控其他人。##”* +

哦，这也促成了我在AP欧洲历史课程中最喜欢的一个持续存在的讨论点：*关于女性的争论。如果我们在《圣经》中读到，在主面前每个人都是平等的，那么这对女性以及女性在社会中的角色, 意味着什么呢？* +

**另一位**你们需要了解的**早期改革者,** 是一个叫**约翰·加尔文**（John Calvin）的人。当我们从全球视角谈论新教时，约翰·加尔文常常被忽视，但他几乎和马丁·路德一样重要。 +

约翰·加尔文是法国人，但后来住在日内瓦（Geneva），*他开创了"加尔文主义"（Calvinism）。他延续了马丁·路德的新教信仰，但有两个例外。* +

**第一点：#他相信"预定论 (命定论)"（predestination）的观点。#**引用《罗马书》8:29-30的内容，*约翰·加尔文说，#上帝在世界创立之前就已经预定了谁会得救，谁不会得救。(那么问题来了: 加尔文是怎么知道上帝的想法意思的呢?)#* +

这从根本上影响了许多基督教的信仰，也引发了更多的冲突，因为**他基本上是说，上帝在人出生之前就已经选定了数量有限的灵魂，这些灵魂能够永远与上帝在天堂同在。** +

关于约翰·加尔文，你们需要知道的**第二点是，他相信如果你努力工作，上帝会通过财富来回报你的努力。这种 “成功神学” 或 “新教工作伦理” 的观念在荷兰共和国（Dutch Republic）深深扎根，**我得说，荷兰人变得非常富有。 +

所以，虽然马丁·路德和约翰·加尔文在16世纪早期, 引领了这场"新教改革"，但如果没有像德西德里乌斯·伊拉斯谟（Desiderius Erasmus）、约翰·威克里夫（John Wycliffe）和扬·胡斯（Jan Hus）这些在他们之前的改革者，他们是无法做到这一点的，*#这些改革者倡导人们应该自己阅读《圣经》(去中介, 去中间商, 不要读二手货, 而要自己去读原版, 直接吸收原版的思想.)。#* +

*#这导致了无数新的基督教教派的出现，因为人们现在自己阅读经文，然后自己解释经文，这就导致了对上帝话语的不同解读。#* +

大家，天主教徒、路德宗信徒, 和加尔文主义者, 都认同一件事，那就是"再洗礼派"（Anabaptists）真的很怪异。*##"再洗礼派"主张教会与国家完全分离，##并且拒绝参与世俗事务，比如纳税和投票。* +
不仅如此，*他们还不赞同婴儿洗礼。他们说，只有当你大脑发育完全时，你才能自己选择是否成为一名基督徒, 并接受洗礼。* +

所以, 这些"再洗礼派"作为一个激进的新教团体出现，欧洲其他的基督教世界并不认同他们的观点。 +

**所以现在出现了一些新的基督教教派，**它们都在小小的欧洲紧密地共存着，我不知道**这是否会引发一些冲突呢？**我们下次再探讨这个问题。 +

Hey students, it's Emily Pool. Let's talk about Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation.

In order to contextualize the Protestant Reformation, we have to start by talking about the Catholic Church. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Catholic Church filled the political void that existed in Europe, and a lot of people became united by their shared common Catholic faith.

The Catholic Church also had a monopoly over education. The majority of the people who were literate were either the elites already in European society or people who worked for the church. Bibles were not common because, prior to the printing press, everything was extraordinarily expensive to produce, which means that the leaders within the church were the ones reading and interpreting scripture on behalf of the congregation.

The Catholic Church taught that salvation -- being made right before a holy God, the forgiveness of sins, access into heaven, and eternity with God forever -- was achieved by good works and by faith. And not only that, but by the 1500s, there was more increased corruption within the Catholic Church through the practice of simony -- or giving out church positions to the higher bidder -- and also the sale of indulgences.

An indulgence was a certificate that was granted by the pope that allowed the purchaser to pay for a lesser time in purgatory for themselves or for a loved one. At this point, a lot of Catholics also believed in purgatory, which means after you die, you're in kind of this holding area before you go to heaven or before you go to hell.
