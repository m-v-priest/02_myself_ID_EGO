== 释义

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 4.3: the Enlightenment 启蒙运动. +

Students, if you've not figured this out 弄明白 by now in these videos, I'm trying to give you literally 确实 just the information that you need -- with maybe a fun story or a fun fact thrown in 穿插；加入 -- in the shortest amount of time as possible. Your time's valuable, your attention span 注意力持续时间 short. I'm trying to meet you where you're at 迎合你的需求. +

Right, this video is going to be a lot because you need to know a lot, so buckle up 系好安全带；做好准备. Let's get right to it. +

Religion says that truth comes from God. The Enlightenment 启蒙运动 says that truth comes from reason 理性. In the same way that scientists in the Scientific Revolution 科学革命 were trying to figure out 弄清楚 the natural laws 自然法则 that dictate 支配；决定 the cosmos 宇宙, enlightenment philosophers 启蒙哲学家 in the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 were trying to figure out natural laws that dictate how and why humans should interact with each other 人类应如何以及为何相互交往. +

And it's intellectuals 知识分子 like Voltaire 伏尔泰 and Diderot 狄德罗 who are the first to apply 应用 these Scientific Revolution-esque principles 类似科学革命的原则 onto human society 人类社会. +

We're going to start this in England. Let's go back to the English Civil War 英国内战. So the English Civil War happened. You want to know who lived through 经历 that and was deeply affected by 深受影响 it? This guy named Thomas Hobbes 托马斯·霍布斯. +

Thomas Hobbes said, "In order to prevent 防止 anything like that from ever happening again, we need to surrender 放弃 all of our rights 权利 and all of our power 权力 to one just ruler 公正的统治者 who will rule over us absolutely 绝对地统治我们." Hobbes was a huge proponent of 大力支持者 absolutism 专制主义. +

And Locke 洛克 -- although also influenced by 受…影响 the English Civil War 英国内战 -- viewed 看待 it very differently. Locke believed that, you know what, actually people are born with natural rights 自然权利: life 生命, liberty 自由, and property 财产. And it is the duty of the government 政府的职责 to protect those natural rights 自然权利. +

And if the government is not protecting those natural rights -- in the case of 在…情况下 the English Civil War 英国内战 -- it is the duty of the people 人民的职责 to overthrow 推翻 that government and reestablish 重建 it with one that actually does protect the rights of the individual 个人权利. +

Locke is advocating for 倡导 revolution 革命. He's literally saying if the government isn't doing its job, overthrow it. This idea in general 总的来说 is radical 激进的, and especially was radical in the 1600s and 1700s. +

What was at the root of 根本原因 this philosophy 哲学 by Locke? The idea of a social contract 社会契约. +

Students, we all have social contracts 社会契约 around us all the time, so don't overthink this. They can be written 书面的 or they can be unwritten 不成文的. A great example of a social contract 社会契约 in the United States is the US Constitution 美国宪法. +

In living in the United States, we are agreeing to abide by 遵守 the laws of the United States that are outlined in 概述于 the Constitution. That's an explicit social contract 明确的社会契约. But there are also implicit social contracts 隐含的社会契约 -- like, I don't know, showing up to work wearing clothes 穿着衣服去上班. That's just like a thing that we do in the United States and in most of the world, and it is just a natural norm 自然规范 that we subconsciously 潜意识地, indirectly 间接地 have agreed to. +

With that defined 定义, looking back at Locke's idea of revolution 革命: it is the duty of the government 政府的职责 to protect the rights of the citizen 公民权利, and if that social contract 社会契约 is not being met 履行, overthrow it. +

This idea of a social contract 社会契约 was also supported by 得到…支持 this guy named Jean-Jacques Rousseau 让 - 雅克·卢梭 -- who actually, you know, wrote a whole book called The Social Contract 《社会契约论》. And I don't love Rousseau, I'm just going to say that right now, because he believed that women's only place in society 女性在社会中的唯一位置 was in the home 家庭. +

While all of these enlightenment philosophers 启蒙哲学家 are like, "Oh yes, let's be learned 有学问的, let's be more involved in 更参与 our political system 政治体制," Rousseau is like, "Yeahhh, only if you're a man." +

But Rousseau says, "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains 束缚," which really just means people are free when they are governed by 受…统治 their own laws 自己的法律 and not the laws that institutions 机构 place on them. +

Rousseau also disagreed with 不同意 Locke on the idea of property 财产, because he believed that private property 私有财产 should be abolished 废除 because the Earth belongs to no one. +

Rousseau and his social contract 社会契约 believed that people should strive toward 努力实现 the common good 公共利益 because serving everyone will benefit everyone. Combining those things together: your individual rights 个人权利, your property rights 财产权 are subservient to 从属于 the general good of the population 大众的利益 -- which, like Locke, is incredibly radical 极其激进的 for this time in Europe. +

These new political theories 政治理论 drastically 极大地 impact 影响 the world -- not only European society 欧洲社会 -- especially John Locke's idea of the consent of the governed 被统治者的同意: that the government only has the right to exist if the people deem it to exist 人民认为政府有存在的权利. That goes directly against 直接违背 divine right 君权神授 and absolutism 专制主义. +

For this next part, I'm just going to tell you some enlightenment philosophers 启蒙哲学家 and tell you what they did. +

Baron de Montesquieu 孟德斯鸠男爵, like Locke, actually believed that absolutism 专制主义 was not the ideal form of government 理想的政府形式 because too much power leads to 导致 corruption 腐败, so he advocated for 倡导 a separation of powers 三权分立. +

Cesare Beccaria 切萨雷·贝卡里亚 -- oh my gosh, I love him so much -- was an Italian philosopher 意大利哲学家 who wrote against 反对 torture 酷刑. His book On Crimes and Punishments 《论犯罪与刑罚》 said, "You know what? The punishment 惩罚 should actually fit the crime committed 与所犯罪行相称 and shouldn't just be death." +

French philosophe 法国哲学家 Voltaire 伏尔泰 -- which is a pen name 笔名, by the way -- was exiled to 流放至 England and spent therefore a lot of time in England during his formative years 成长时期. And he was shocked by 对…感到震惊 what he saw there. +

There was economic freedom 经济自由, and that the nobility 贵族 had to pay taxes 纳税. There was religious toleration 宗教宽容 -- unless you're Catholic -- and there was political representation of the people 人民的政治代表 through elections 选举. That is some insane stuff 不可思议的事情. +

And when Voltaire went back to France, he was like, "You know what? France maybe is not doing this well." Voltaire comes back to France and he writes like it's running out of time 时间紧迫. And his two main critiques 主要批判 -- his two main targets 主要目标 -- were the Catholic Church 天主教会 and their power 权力, and the French monarchy 法国君主制 and its power 权力. +

And his critiques of 对…的批判 those two institutions of power 权力机构 led to 导致 his multiple jailings 多次入狱, which then made him want to say, "You know what? Freedom of speech 言论自由 is important above all else 高于一切. I should be able to critique the government 批评政府 and I should not have to be jailed for that 不应为此入狱." +

Mary Wollstonecraft 玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特 -- because women are important too -- was a female philosopher 女性哲学家 who said, "You know what? Women only appear inferior to 显得不如 men because they lack equal access to education 缺乏平等的教育机会." +

And yes, Mary Wollstonecraft is the mother of Mary Shelley 玛丽·雪莱 who wrote Frankenstein 《弗兰肯斯坦》, which you have probably read in your high school career 高中学习生涯. +

The last one I'll talk about here is Denis Diderot 德尼·狄德罗. He was a French philosopher 法国哲学家 who believed that if people had access to 有权获得 all information 所有信息, they would be able to critique accurately 准确批判 the things that are happening in society 社会中发生的事情. +

Diderot's mission 使命 to compile 编纂 all knowledge 所有知识 -- all human learning 人类学问 -- into one book: the Encyclopedia 《百科全书》. Diderot and his focus on 专注于 the democratization of learning 学习的民主化 -- giving learning to everyone 让每个人都能学习 -- he is the internet of his time 他那个时代的互联网. He was the TikTok of his time. We love Denis. +

Students, I hope as I was sharing those names that you in your brain somewhere made a connection 建立联系 that these philosophers 哲学家 are from England and from France and one from Italy. And I want you in your class or with your best friend or with your little group chat right now think about why that's the case 为什么会这样. +

All of these philosophers 哲学家 are not just existing on their own separate islands 各自孤立存在. They are meeting together 相聚, they're working together 合作. People are sharing their ideas where? In coffee shops 咖啡馆. Coffee -- the drug that aided the enlightenment 推动启蒙运动的饮品 -- much like it still aids you in your studies today probably 可能就像现在它仍然帮助你学习一样. +

And while women often times 经常 were not directly involved in 直接参与 these conversations, women did host Enlightenment salons 启蒙沙龙. Think of it like a very smart, intelligent, classy dinner party 高雅的晚宴. And the women -- like Madame de Geoffrin 若弗兰夫人 -- were the ones who came up with 制定 the guest list 宾客名单 and then got to sit in 旁听 and listen with everything that was being shared. +

Outside of just political theories 政治理论, there are also new economic theories 经济理论 that these enlightenment philosophers 启蒙哲学家 are focusing on 关注. Very famously, Adam Smith 亚当·斯密 in his book The Wealth of Nations 《国富论》 says, "Actually, mercantilism 重商主义 is not where it's at 不是正确的方向. Hard money 硬通货 is not the source of wealth 财富来源 like these mercantilists believe, but rather it is land and resources 土地和资源." +

Physiocrats 重农主义者 were the first to come up with 提出 these new economic theories 经济理论, and François Quesnay 弗朗索瓦·魁奈 believed that mercantile policies 商业政策 -- by limiting and restricting trade 限制贸易 -- were violating 违反 the natural laws of economics 经济学的自然法则. +

So the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 -- with its focus on 专注于 reason 理性, rationalism 理性主义, empiricism 经验主义, and skepticism 怀疑主义 -- also changes religion and religious view 宗教及宗教观念 in Europe. A lot of these enlightenment philosophers 启蒙哲学家 advocate for 倡导 more religious toleration 宗教宽容 -- which again is just a radical concept 激进的概念 for the continent of Europe at this point. +

But some of these philosophers -- like Voltaire and Diderot -- take it a step further 更进一步 and develop new philosophies 哲学 like deism 自然神论 and atheism 无神论. +

Deism 自然神论 is the idea that God is a divine clockmaker 神圣的钟表匠 -- there is a God that created the world and set it into motion 启动世界 but then has since remained absent from human affairs 此后不再干预人类事务. And atheism 无神论 is the idea that there is no God 不存在上帝. +

And it is these theories circulating 传播 in a post-religious war Europe 宗教战争后的欧洲 that move religion from being a commonly discussed idea 普遍讨论的话题 to a very private concern 非常私人的事情 -- with like just you and your family. +

That was a lot. The Enlightenment 启蒙运动 -- a focus on reason and rationalism 专注于理性 -- impacts political ideologies 政治意识形态, economic theories 经济理论, and also religion 宗教. +

If you need any help with any of those, you know you got to check out 查看 my Ultimate Review Packet 终极复习资料包, which is always linked in the description below. +

Sorry this was a little bit of a longer one, but to be fair 公平地说, I did tell you that at the beginning of the video. And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。咱们来聊聊主题4.3：启蒙运动（the Enlightenment）。 +

同学们，如果你们到现在还没从这些视频中明白这一点，我其实是在尽可能短的时间内，给你们提供你们需要的信息——可能还会加入一些有趣的故事或事实。你们的时间很宝贵，注意力持续时间也有限。我是在尽力迎合你们的情况。 +

好了，这个视频内容会很多，因为你们需要了解很多东西，所以系好安全带。咱们直接进入正题。 +

**宗教认为"真理来自上帝"。启蒙运动则认为"真理来自理性"。**就像科学革命（Scientific Revolution）时期的科学家试图弄清楚支配宇宙的自然法则一样，启蒙运动时期的启蒙哲学家, 试图弄清楚支配人类如何以及为何相互交往的自然法则。 +

*像伏尔泰（Voltaire）和狄德罗（Diderot）这样的知识分子，是第一批将类似"科学革命"的原则, 应用于人类社会的人。* +

我们从英国开始讲起。让我们回到英国内战（English Civil War）时期。英国内战爆发了。你们想知道谁经历了那场战争并且深受其影响吗？有个叫托马斯·霍布斯（Thomas Hobbes）的人。 +

托马斯·霍布斯说：“为了防止类似的事情再次发生，我们需要把我们所有的权利和权力, 都交给一个公正的统治者，他将绝对地统治我们。” 霍布斯是"专制主义"（absolutism）的大力支持者。 +

而洛克（Locke）——虽然也受到英国内战的影响——对此有截然不同的看法。**洛克认为，**实际上，*人人生而享有自然权利：生命、自由和财产。政府的职责就是保护这些自然权利。* +
*如果政府不保护这些自然权利——就像英国内战的情况那样——人民有责任推翻那个政府，然后建立一个真正保护个人权利的政府。* +
**洛克主张革命。他直白地表示如果政府不履行职责，就推翻它。**总体而言，这个观点很激进，在17世纪和18世纪尤其如此。 +

*洛克这种哲学的根源是什么呢？是"社会契约"（social contract）的概念。* +

同学们，**我们身边一直都有"社会契约"，**所以别想太复杂。*它们可以是成文的，也可以是不成文的。美国宪法（US Constitution）就是社会契约的一个很好的例子。* +
生活在美国，我们同意遵守宪法中规定的美国法律。这是一个明确的社会契约。但也有隐性的社会契约——比如，我不知道，穿着衣服去上班。这在美国以及世界上大多数地方都是我们会做的事情，这是我们下意识地、间接地认同的一种自然规范。 +

定义了社会契约后，再看看**洛克的革命理念：政府有责任保护公民的权利，如果"社会契约"没有得到履行，就推翻政府。** +

**社会契约这个观点也得到了一个叫让 - 雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）的人的支持——实际上，他写了一本名为《社会契约论》（The Social Contract）的书。**我得说，我不太喜欢卢梭，因为他认为女性在社会中的唯一位置就是在家里。 +
当所有这些启蒙哲学家都说：“哦，是的，我们要博学多识，要更多地参与我们的政治体系” 时，卢梭却说：“是啊，不过只有男性可以这样” 。 +

但**卢梭也说：“人人生而自由，却无处不在枷锁之中” **，这实际上意味着当人们受自己制定的法律统治，而不是受机构制定的法律统治时，他们才是自由的。 +

卢梭在财产问题上, 也与洛克意见相左，因为他认为私有财产应该被废除，因为地球不属于任何人。 +
卢梭和他的"社会契约"理论认为，人们应该为了共同利益而努力，因为为所有人服务会让所有人受益。综合这些观点：个人权利、财产权利都要服从于民众的共同利益——和洛克的观点一样，这在当时的欧洲是非常激进的。 +

*这些新的政治理论, 对世界产生了巨大影响*——不仅仅是欧洲社会——*尤其是约翰·洛克（John Locke）关于"被统治者同意"的观点：只有当人民认为政府应该存在时，政府才有权存在。这直接与"君权神授"（divine right）和专制主义相悖。* +

接下来，我要给你们介绍一些启蒙哲学家，并讲讲他们的主张。 +

*孟德斯鸠男爵*（Baron de Montesquieu）和洛克一样，实际上**认为"专制主义"不是理想的政府形式，因为权力过于集中会导致腐败，所以他主张"权力分立"（separation of powers）。** +

切萨雷·贝卡里亚（Cesare Beccaria）——天哪，我非常喜欢他——是一位意大利哲学家，他反对酷刑。他的《论犯罪与刑罚》（On Crimes and Punishments）这本书中写道：“你们知道吗？刑罚实际上应该与所犯罪行相匹配，而不应该只是死刑。” +

法国哲学家伏尔泰（顺便说一下，这是他的笔名）被流放到英国，在他性格形成的关键时期，他在英国待了很长时间。他在那里看到的景象让他震惊。 +
那里有经济自由，贵族必须纳税。还有宗教宽容——当然，天主教徒除外——并且通过选举,实现了人民的"政治代表权"。这些情况太令人惊讶了。 +

当伏尔泰回到法国时，他想：“你们知道吗？法国在这些方面做得不太好。” 伏尔泰回到法国后，争分夺秒地写作。他的两个主要批判对象是天主教会及其权力，还有法国君主制及其权力。 +
*他对这两个权力机构的批判, 导致他多次入狱，这让他意识到：*“你们知道吗？**言论自由高于一切。**我应该能够批评政府，而且不应该因此入狱。” +

玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特（Mary Wollstonecraft）——女性在这方面也很重要——是一位女性哲学家，她说：“你们知道吗？*女性看起来不如男性，是因为她们没有平等的受教育机会。*” +
是的，玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特, 是玛丽·雪莱（Mary Shelley）的母亲，玛丽·雪莱写了《弗兰肯斯坦》（Frankenstein），你们可能在高中时读过这本书。 +

我在这里要讲的最后一位是德尼·狄德罗（Denis Diderot）。他是一位法国哲学家，他认为**如果人们能够获取所有信息(知情权)，他们就能够准确地批判社会中发生的事情。** +
狄德罗的使命, 是将所有知识——所有人类的学问——汇编成一本书：《百科全书》（Encyclopedia）。狄德罗关注学习的民主化——把知识带给每一个人——他就相当于他那个时代的互联网。他就是那个时代的抖音。我们喜欢德尼。 +

同学们，我希望当我分享这些名字的时候，你们能联想到**这些哲学家来自英国、法国，还有一位来自意大利。**我希望你们在课堂上，或者和你们最好的朋友，或者在你们的小群聊里，思考一下**为什么会这样**。 +
**所有这些哲学家并不是孤立存在的。他们会相聚，会一起合作。人们在哪里分享他们的观点呢？在咖啡馆里。**咖啡——推动启蒙运动的 “灵药”——就像现在咖啡也能帮助你们学习一样。 +

**虽然女性通常没有直接参与这些讨论，但女性会举办启蒙沙龙。**把它想象成一个非常聪明、睿智、高雅的晚宴聚会。像德·杰弗琳夫人（Madame de Geoffrin）这样的女性会制定宾客名单，然后坐在那里聆听分享的一切。 +

**除了"政治理论"，这些启蒙哲学家还关注新的"经济理论"。**非常著名的是，亚当·斯密（Adam Smith）在他的《国富论》（The Wealth of Nations）一书中说：“实际上，重商主义（mercantilism）并不靠谱。硬通货并不是像重商主义者认为的那样是财富的来源，土地和资源才是。” +
重农主义者（Physiocrats）是最早提出这些新经济理论的人，弗朗索瓦·魁奈（François Quesnay）认为**"重商主义"政策——通过限制和约束贸易——违背了经济学的自然法则。** +

所以**启蒙运动——关注理性、理性主义、经验主义和怀疑主义——也改变了欧洲的宗教和宗教观念。**很多这些启蒙哲学家主张更多的宗教宽容——这在当时的欧洲大陆是一个非常激进的概念。 +

但是像伏尔泰和狄德罗这样的**哲学家更进一步，发展出了自然神论（deism）和无神论（atheism）这样的新哲学思想。** +
*"自然神论"认为, 上帝就像一个神圣的钟表匠——有一个上帝创造了世界并让它运转起来，但此后就不再干预人类事务。*"无神论"则认为根本没有上帝。 +

*这些理论在宗教战争后的欧洲传播开来，使得宗教从一个普遍讨论的话题, 变成了一个非常私人的问题——只关乎你和你的家人。* +

内容很多。启蒙运动——关注理性和理性主义——影响了政治意识形态、经济理论，还有宗教。 +
如果你们在这些方面需要任何帮助，你们知道要查看我的终极复习资料包，链接就在下面的描述里。 +
抱歉这个视频有点长，但公平地说，我在视频开头就告诉过你们了。同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 4.3: the Enlightenment.

Students, if you've not figured this out by now in these videos, I'm trying to give you literally just the information that you need -- with maybe a fun story or a fun fact thrown in -- in the shortest amount of time as possible. Your time's valuable, your attention span short. I'm trying to meet you where you're at.

Right, this video is going to be a lot because you need to know a lot, so buckle up. Let's get right to it.

Religion says that truth comes from God. The Enlightenment says that truth comes from reason. In the same way that scientists in the Scientific Revolution were trying to figure out the natural laws that dictate the cosmos, enlightenment philosophers in the Enlightenment were trying to figure out natural laws that dictate how and why humans should interact with each other.

And it's intellectuals like Voltaire and Diderot who are the first to apply these Scientific Revolution-esque principles onto human society.

We're going to start this in England. Let's go back to the English Civil War. So the English Civil War happened. You want to know who lived through that and was deeply affected by it? This guy named Thomas Hobbes.

Thomas Hobbes said, "In order to prevent anything like that from ever happening again, we need to surrender all of our rights and all of our power to one just ruler who will rule over us absolutely." Hobbes was a huge proponent of absolutism.

And Locke -- although also influenced by the English Civil War -- viewed it very differently. Locke believed that, you know what, actually people are born with natural rights: life, liberty, and property. And it is the duty of the government to protect those natural rights.

And if the government is not protecting those natural rights -- in the case of the English Civil War -- it is the duty of the people to overthrow that government and reestablish it with one that actually does protect the rights of the individual.

Locke is advocating for revolution. He's literally saying if the government isn't doing its job, overthrow it. This idea in general is radical, and especially was radical in the 1600s and 1700s.

What was at the root of this philosophy by Locke? The idea of a social contract.

Students, we all have social contracts around us all the time, so don't overthink this. They can be written or they can be unwritten. A great example of a social contract in the United States is the US Constitution.

In living in the United States, we are agreeing to abide by the laws of the United States that are outlined in the Constitution. That's an explicit social contract. But there are also implicit social contracts -- like, I don't know, showing up to work wearing clothes. That's just like a thing that we do in the United States and in most of the world, and it is just a natural norm that we subconsciously, indirectly have agreed to.

With that defined, looking back at Locke's idea of revolution: it is the duty of the government to protect the rights of the citizen, and if that social contract is not being met, overthrow it.

This idea of a social contract was also supported by this guy named Jean-Jacques Rousseau -- who actually, you know, wrote a whole book called The Social Contract. And I don't love Rousseau, I'm just going to say that right now, because he believed that women's only place in society was in the home.

While all of these enlightenment philosophers are like, "Oh yes, let's be learned, let's be more involved in our political system," Rousseau is like, "Yeahhh, only if you're a man."

But Rousseau says, "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains," which really just means people are free when they are governed by their own laws and not the laws that institutions place on them.

Rousseau also disagreed with Locke on the idea of property, because he believed that private property should be abolished because the Earth belongs to no one.

Rousseau and his social contract believed that people should strive toward the common good because serving everyone will benefit everyone. Combining those things together: your individual rights, your property rights are subservient to the general good of the population -- which, like Locke, is incredibly radical for this time in Europe.

These new political theories drastically impact the world -- not only European society -- especially John Locke's idea of the consent of the governed: that the government only has the right to exist if the people deem it to exist. That goes directly against divine right and absolutism.

For this next part, I'm just going to tell you some enlightenment philosophers and tell you what they did.

Baron de Montesquieu, like Locke, actually believed that absolutism was not the ideal form of government because too much power leads to corruption, so he advocated for a separation of powers.

Cesare Beccaria -- oh my gosh, I love him so much -- was an Italian philosopher who wrote against torture. His book On Crimes and Punishments said, "You know what? The punishment should actually fit the crime committed and shouldn't just be death."

French philosophe Voltaire -- which is a pen name, by the way -- was exiled to England and spent therefore a lot of time in England during his formative years. And he was shocked by what he saw there.

There was economic freedom, and that the nobility had to pay taxes. There was religious toleration -- unless you're Catholic -- and there was political representation of the people through elections. That is some insane stuff.

And when Voltaire went back to France, he was like, "You know what? France maybe is not doing this well." Voltaire comes back to France and he writes like it's running out of time. And his two main critiques -- his two main targets -- were the Catholic Church and their power, and the French monarchy and its power.

And his critiques of those two institutions of power led to his multiple jailings, which then made him want to say, "You know what? Freedom of speech is important above all else. I should be able to critique the government and I should not have to be jailed for that."

Mary Wollstonecraft -- because women are important too -- was a female philosopher who said, "You know what? Women only appear inferior to men because they lack equal access to education."

And yes, Mary Wollstonecraft is the mother of Mary Shelley who wrote Frankenstein, which you have probably read in your high school career.

The last one I'll talk about here is Denis Diderot. He was a French philosopher who believed that if people had access to all information, they would be able to critique accurately the things that are happening in society.

Diderot's mission to compile all knowledge -- all human learning -- into one book: the Encyclopedia. Diderot and his focus on the democratization of learning -- giving learning to everyone -- he is the internet of his time. He was the TikTok of his time. We love Denis.

Students, I hope as I was sharing those names that you in your brain somewhere made a connection that these philosophers are from England and from France and one from Italy. And I want you in your class or with your best friend or with your little group chat right now think about why that's the case.

All of these philosophers are not just existing on their own separate islands. They are meeting together, they're working together. People are sharing their ideas where? In coffee shops. Coffee -- the drug that aided the enlightenment -- much like it still aids you in your studies today probably.

And while women often times were not directly involved in these conversations, women did host Enlightenment salons. Think of it like a very smart, intelligent, classy dinner party. And the women -- like Madame de Geoffrin -- were the ones who came up with the guest list and then got to sit in and listen with everything that was being shared.

Outside of just political theories, there are also new economic theories that these enlightenment philosophers are focusing on. Very famously, Adam Smith in his book The Wealth of Nations says, "Actually, mercantilism is not where it's at. Hard money is not the source of wealth like these mercantilists believe, but rather it is land and resources."

Physiocrats were the first to come up with these new economic theories, and François Quesnay believed that mercantile policies -- by limiting and restricting trade -- were violating the natural laws of economics.

So the Enlightenment -- with its focus on reason, rationalism, empiricism, and skepticism -- also changes religion and religious view in Europe. A lot of these enlightenment philosophers advocate for more religious toleration -- which again is just a radical concept for the continent of Europe at this point.

But some of these philosophers -- like Voltaire and Diderot -- take it a step further and develop new philosophies like deism and atheism.

Deism is the idea that God is a divine clockmaker -- there is a God that created the world and set it into motion but then has since remained absent from human affairs. And atheism is the idea that there is no God.

And it is these theories circulating in a post-religious war Europe that move religion from being a commonly discussed idea to a very private concern -- with like just you and your family.

That was a lot. The Enlightenment -- a focus on reason and rationalism -- impacts political ideologies, economic theories, and also religion.

If you need any help with any of those, you know you got to check out my Ultimate Review Packet, which is always linked in the description below.

Sorry this was a little bit of a longer one, but to be fair, I did tell you that at the beginning of the video. And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.
