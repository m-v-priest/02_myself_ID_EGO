Students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 5.3: Britain's Ascendancy 英国的优势地位. +

Throughout European history 欧洲历史, Britain has had many rivals 对手 -- yes with Spain -- but I would argue 认为 that their most important rival 对手 and maybe even longest lasting rival 持续时间最长的对手 is France. And both of those conflicts 冲突 are exacerbated 加剧 by the fact that Britain is Protestant 新教的 and France and Spain are Catholic 天主教的. +

And while England and the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国 competed economically 经济上竞争, they did not compete politically 政治上竞争 -- especially after the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命 and William of Orange 奥兰治的威廉 becoming co-monarch 共治君主 with Mary. +

By the end of the 1600s, Britain had the strongest navy 海军 in all of Europe, and they were determined to 决心 prove that to everyone else. +

Let me just recap 回顾 some British history for you -- or let me give you some context 背景 for you to be able to understand why Britain was able to ascend 崛起 and supplant 取代 France as Europe's strongest power 最强大的国家 by the 1700s. +

In the mid-1600s, England had fought their Civil War 内战 which ended with that Glorious Revolution 光荣革命 which established the power of Parliament 议会权力 and made the monarch 君主 in England work with Parliament forever. +

In the early 1700s, the Acts of Union 联合法案 had been passed which means that England and Scotland 苏格兰 are now Britain. And after the War of Spanish Succession 西班牙王位继承战争 and the subsequent 随后的 Peace of Utrecht 乌得勒支和约, the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国, Spain, and France were all weakened 被削弱 compared to Britain. +

What's going on that allows Britain to dominate militarily 军事上占主导地位 by the end of the 1700s? While the War of Austrian Succession 奥地利王位继承战争 and the Seven Years' War... +

1713: Charles VI 查理六世, leader of the Habsburg lands 哈布斯堡领地, passes the Pragmatic Sanction 国事诏书. He does not have a male heir 男性继承人, so he desires 希望 that his lands will go to his highest ranking female heir 地位最高的女性继承人, Maria Theresa 玛丽娅·特蕾莎. +

Frederick II of Prussia 普鲁士的腓特烈二世 is like, "I don't know how I feel about this. What if in fact I just take over 接管 Silesia 西里西亚 -- this land that's kind of controlled by the Austrians or Maria Theresa?" +

At this point, France and Spain wanted to weaken the power of the Habsburgs 哈布斯堡家族 and allied with 与…结盟 Prussia. And Britain -- hating France and Spain -- allied with 与…结盟 Maria Theresa and Austria. +

The war ultimately 最终 ends with Austria's win because Frederick II recognizes Maria Theresa's husband as the rightful ruler 合法统治者 of Austria. Which Frederick -- you're supposed to be this enlightened monarch 开明君主, yet you don't want to give authority to 赋予权力 a woman? Surely. +

Thereafter 此后, the Seven Years' War 七年战争 breaks out 爆发 because Austria wants to reclaim 收复 the lands that Prussia had taken from it -- Silesia -- during the War of Austrian Succession 奥地利王位继承战争. +

And this is when Britain pulls an UNO reverse 扭转局势 because Britain now allies with 与…结盟 Prussia because of their shared Protestantism 共同的新教信仰 and also because France had allied with 与…结盟 Austria, and Britain wants to just you know destroy France and make them as weak as possible 尽可能削弱. +

Geographically 从地理角度, how this actually works out 实际发展情况 is essentially 本质上: Britain is fighting France, and Austria is fighting Prussia. And because Britain is fighting France, they're also fighting each other in the colonies 殖民地 -- which is why the Seven Years' War plays out as 表现为 the French and Indian War 法印战争 in the Americas 美洲. +

Britain and Prussia win because Prussia has one of the strongest standing militaries 常备军 in Europe, and Britain is the strongest naval power 海军强国 -- which means that in the Americas, Britain gets land up to the Mississippi 密西西比河, and France loses a ton of its colonies 殖民地. +

Which sets the stage for 为…奠定基础 the American Revolution 美国独立战争 -- which should weaken Britain more than it does, but it sure doesn't because then the French Revolution 法国大革命 happens. And Britain has also industrialized 实现工业化 by this point, so they're just able to take over 掌控 everything. +

And because I said the French Revolution, it's time to go to our next video which is about why it happened. Make sure you're following along. And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you. +

同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题5.3：英国的崛起。 +

在欧洲历史上，英国有很多对手——没错，和西班牙是对手——但我认为，它最重要的对手，甚至可以说是最持久的对手，是法国。而且，*英国是新教徒国家，法国和西班牙是天主教国家，这一事实加剧了它们之间的冲突。* +
*虽然英国和荷兰共和国在经济上存在竞争，但在政治上并不存在竞争*——尤其是在光荣革命（Glorious Revolution）以及奥兰治的威廉（William of Orange）和玛丽（Mary）共同成为君主之后。 +

到17世纪末，英国拥有全欧洲最强大的海军，而且他们决心向其他国家证明这一点。 +

让我来给你们回顾一下英国历史——或者说，给你们讲讲背景，以便你们理解为什么在18世纪英国能够崛起并取代法国成为欧洲最强大的国家。 +

*在17世纪中期，英国经历了内战，内战以"光荣革命"结束，#光荣革命确立了议会的权力，并使得英国君主永远与议会合作#*。 +

在18世纪早期，《联合法案》（Acts of Union）通过，这意味着英格兰和苏格兰合并成为英国。在西班牙王位继承战争（War of Spanish Succession）以及随后的《乌得勒支和约》（Peace of Utrecht）之后，荷兰共和国、西班牙和法国与英国相比都被削弱了。 +
那么，是什么让英国在18世纪末, 在军事上占据主导地位呢？"奥地利王位继承战争"（War of Austrian Succession）, 和"七年战争"（Seven Years' War）…… +

1713年，哈布斯堡领地的统治者查理六世（Charles VI）通过了《国事诏书》（Pragmatic Sanction）。他没有男性继承人，所以他希望他的领地, 由他地位最高的女性继承人玛丽娅·特蕾莎（Maria Theresa）继承。 +
普鲁士的腓特烈二世（Frederick II）心想：“我对此不太认同。要是我夺取西里西亚（Silesia）呢——这块土地在一定程度上,由奥地利人或者玛丽娅·特蕾莎控制。” +
在这个时候，法国和西班牙想要削弱哈布斯堡家族的权力，于是与普鲁士结盟。而英国——讨厌法国和西班牙——与玛丽娅·特蕾莎和奥地利结盟。 +

战争最终以奥地利的胜利告终，因为腓特烈二世承认,玛丽娅·特蕾莎的丈夫是奥地利的合法统治者。腓特烈——你本应是开明的君主，可你却不想把权力交给一个女性？确实如此。 +

此后，*七年战争爆发，因为奥地利想要收复"普鲁士在奥地利王位继承战争期间,从它手中夺走的西里西亚"。* +
而这时英国改变了立场，因为英国与普鲁士结盟，一方面是因为他们都是新教徒，另一方面是因为法国与奥地利结盟，而英国想要摧毁法国，让它尽可能地衰弱。 +
从地理角度来看，实际情况是这样的：英国与法国作战，奥地利与普鲁士作战。而且因为英国与法国作战，他们在殖民地也相互争斗——这就是为什么**七年战争在美洲表现为"法印战争"**（French and Indian War）。 +

英国和普鲁士获胜，因为普鲁士拥有欧洲最强大的常备军之一，而英国是最强大的海上力量——这意味着**在美洲，英国得到了密西西比河沿岸的土地，而法国失去了大量殖民地。** +
这为美国独立战争（American Revolution）埋下了伏笔——这场战争本应让英国受到更大的削弱，但事实并非如此，因为紧接着"法国大革命"（French Revolution）爆发了。而且此时英国已经实现了工业化(工业革命)，所以他们能够掌控一切。 +

因为我提到了法国大革命，所以接下来我们看下一个视频，讲讲法国大革命发生的原因。一定要跟上进度哦。同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 5.3: Britain's Ascendancy.

Throughout European history, Britain has had many rivals -- yes with Spain -- but I would argue that their most important rival and maybe even longest lasting rival is France. And both of those conflicts are exacerbated by the fact that Britain is Protestant and France and Spain are Catholic.

And while England and the Dutch Republic competed economically, they did not compete politically -- especially after the Glorious Revolution and William of Orange becoming co-monarch with Mary.

By the end of the 1600s, Britain had the strongest navy in all of Europe, and they were determined to prove that to everyone else.

Let me just recap some British history for you -- or let me give you some context for you to be able to understand why Britain was able to ascend and supplant France as Europe's strongest power by the 1700s.

In the mid-1600s, England had fought their Civil War which ended with that Glorious Revolution which established the power of Parliament and made the monarch in England work with Parliament forever.

In the early 1700s, the Acts of Union had been passed which means that England and Scotland are now Britain. And after the War of Spanish Succession and the subsequent Peace of Utrecht, the Dutch Republic, Spain, and France were all weakened compared to Britain.

What's going on that allows Britain to dominate militarily by the end of the 1700s? While the War of Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War...

1713: Charles VI, leader of the Habsburg lands, passes the Pragmatic Sanction. He does not have a male heir, so he desires that his lands will go to his highest ranking female heir, Maria Theresa.

Frederick II of Prussia is like, "I don't know how I feel about this. What if in fact I just take over Silesia -- this land that's kind of controlled by the Austrians or Maria Theresa?"

At this point, France and Spain wanted to weaken the power of the Habsburgs and allied with Prussia. And Britain -- hating France and Spain -- allied with Maria Theresa and Austria.

The war ultimately ends with Austria's win because Frederick II recognizes Maria Theresa's husband as the rightful ruler of Austria. Which Frederick -- you're supposed to be this enlightened monarch, yet you don't want to give authority to a woman? Surely.

Thereafter, the Seven Years' War breaks out because Austria wants to reclaim the lands that Prussia had taken from it -- Silesia -- during the War of Austrian Succession.

And this is when Britain pulls an UNO reverse because Britain now allies with Prussia because of their shared Protestantism and also because France had allied with Austria, and Britain wants to just you know destroy France and make them as weak as possible.

Geographically, how this actually works out is essentially: Britain is fighting France, and Austria is fighting Prussia. And because Britain is fighting France, they're also fighting each other in the colonies -- which is why the Seven Years' War plays out as the French and Indian War in the Americas.

Britain and Prussia win because Prussia has one of the strongest standing militaries in Europe, and Britain is the strongest naval power -- which means that in the Americas, Britain gets land up to the Mississippi, and France loses a ton of its colonies.

Which sets the stage for the American Revolution -- which should weaken Britain more than it does, but it sure doesn't because then the French Revolution happens. And Britain has also industrialized by this point, so they're just able to take over everything.

And because I said the French Revolution, it's time to go to our next video which is about why it happened. Make sure you're following along. And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.
