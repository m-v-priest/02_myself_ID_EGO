Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 6.2: The Spread of Industry Throughout Europe 工业在欧洲的传播. +

The Industrial Revolution 工业革命 started in Great Britain because of its environmental 环境的, political 政治的, and economic advantages 经济优势. Let's break those three things down 分析一下. +

Environmentally 从环境角度, geographically 从地理角度, Britain just lucked out 运气好. They happened to have an abundance of 大量的 coal 煤炭 that was very close to the surface 接近地表 and a ton of iron deposits 铁矿储量. And not only that, they had navigable waterways 可通航的水道 like canals 运河 and rivers that allowed for easy transportation 便于运输. +

Oh, and helpfully enough 而且很有利的是, those waterways fueled 为…提供动力 water mills 水车 and then the water frame 水力纺纱机 -- both of which led to 导致 eventually the steam engine 蒸汽机. +

Economically 从经济角度, Britain had ascended 崛起, as we talked about in last unit. Britain had a ready supply of 现成的 colonies in India and also in the Americas, and they were using those colonies to produce cotton 棉花 which they then shipped back to England. +

Students, it is no coincidence 绝非巧合 why the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 started in the textile industry 纺织业. Plus, Britain's economic history of having joint stock companies 股份公司 and early -- essentially 本质上 -- venture capitalists 风险投资家 created a pretty favorable climate 有利环境 for new inventors to create new things that would make them more money. +

Parliament 议会 really supported industrialization 工业化 because it's going to give Britain as a whole 作为一个整体 more power. Yes, but a lot of people who worked in Parliament also realized that they could potentially 有可能 profit 获利 extraordinary sums 巨额款项 off of 从… sponsoring and supporting industrialization, so of course they are going to do that. +

A huge example of government support of industry through commercial factors 商业因素 is the repeal 废除 of the Corn Laws 谷物法. Now, the Corn Laws had been in effect 生效 to protect British farmers. They essentially 实质上 placed really high tariffs 高关税 on any sort of grain 谷物 -- "corn" in this sense means grain, not literal stalks of corn 玉米杆 -- coming into Britain. +

And that was supposed to encourage agricultural production 农业生产 and support farmers and protect farmers in Britain. By the mid-1800s, that was leading to an incredible amount of problems in Britain because food prices were super high, and whenever there was a drought 干旱 or a famine 饥荒 -- like, I don't know, the Irish Potato Famine 爱尔兰大饥荒 -- food prices were exorbitant 过高的, and that hurt the workers. +

The repeal of the Corn Laws in Britain led to 导致 an increase in imported grains 进口谷物增加, which led to a decrease in the need for agricultural workers 农业工人需求减少 to produce that grain within the British Isles 不列颠群岛, which then led to 导致 Britain transitioning from 转变 an agricultural-dominated economy 以农业为主的经济 -- an agrarian economy 农业经济 -- to an industrial manufacturer economy 工业制造经济. +

Also, it contributes to 促成 the rise of free trade 自由贸易的兴起, which really helps support Britain's economic dominance 经济主导地位. +

British economists 经济学家 and British politicians 政治家 are being incredibly smart with this first wave of industrialization 第一轮工业化浪潮. When the factories first start to arise 出现 and develop in places like Leeds 利兹 and Manchester 曼彻斯特, because they start to take the profits 利润 -- the proceeds 收益 of those factories -- and then pump them back into 投入 the factories so they can have better and more efficient machines 更高效的机器, which then leads to 导致 more and more wealth 财富 in more and more factories. +

So much so that 以至于 in 1851, Britain decides to host 举办 the Great Exhibition 万国工业博览会. You can think of this like a European World's Fair 欧洲世界博览会, and it was held at their Crystal Palace 水晶宫 -- which, to be fair 公平地说, would have been something beautiful and incredibly impressive to look at, but too bad it burned down in a fire 烧毁. +

Essentially 本质上, the Great Exhibition was Britain saying to the rest of Europe: "Look how great we are. Look at all the things we've created. Look what we can produce. Have you done any of this? No." +

No, be fair 公平地说, they hadn't, because the rest of Europe moved toward industrialization 工业化 at a much more gradual pace 更为缓慢的速度. This again is due to 由于 their environmental, economic, and political factors 因素. +

Geography 地理 has made the world why it is today, so Southern and Southeastern Europe's lack of industrial development 工业发展不足 is literally 确实 due to a lack of natural resources 自然资源匮乏. It also didn't help that the economic practices 经济模式 in that region of Europe were still mainly rooted in 主要基于 serfdom 农奴制. +

But in general 总的来说, for the countries that took a little bit longer to industrialize 实现工业化, it's because they didn't have the same governmental support 政府支持 as Britain did, or it's because their political systems 政治制度 were still rooted in 基于 landed aristocracy 土地贵族 and not commercial wealth 商业财富. +

In unit five, we talked about how Britain had ascended 崛起. And in unit six -- ooh -- Britain is about to take over 掌控 the whole world. As they say, the sun never sets on the British Empire 日不落帝国. +

Political instability 政治不稳定 in France, especially after their French Revolution 法国大革命, led to 导致 their lack of development 发展不足. But you know who had a really great time at industrial development 工业发展 in Europe on the continent 欧洲大陆? Woo, Russia. But we'll get there next time. +

I hope this helped. And students, as always, you can do it. I believe in you. +

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题6.2：工业在欧洲的传播。 +

*工业革命始于英国，这得益于它在环境、政治和经济方面的优势。我们来剖析一下这三个方面。* +

从环境方面来看，在地理上，英国很幸运。他们恰好有大量接近地表的煤炭,以及丰富的铁矿储备。不仅如此，他们还有像运河和河流这样可通航的水路，便于运输。 +
哦，而且很有帮助的是，这些水路, 为水磨坊以及水力纺纱机提供了动力，最终促成了蒸汽机的出现。 +

从经济方面来说，正如我们在上一单元谈到的，英国已经崛起。英国在印度以及美洲拥有大量的殖民地，他们利用这些殖民地种植棉花，然后把棉花运回英国。 +
同学们，工业革命从纺织业开始并非偶然。此外，**英国有着"联合股份公司"的经济历史，并且早期就有（本质上的）风险资本家，这为新的发明家**创造能让他们赚更多钱的新事物, *营造了非常有利的氛围。* +

**"议会"大力支持工业化，**因为这会让整个英国更强大。没错，但很多在议会工作的人也意识到，**他们通过赞助和支持工业化, 有可能赚取巨额利润，**所以他们当然会这么做。 +

政府通过商业因素支持工业的一个重要例子, 是**《谷物法》（Corn Laws）的废除。**《谷物法》原本是为了保护英国农民而实施的。实际上，*它对任何进入英国的谷物（这里的 “corn” 指的是谷物，不是真正的玉米植株）都设置了很高的关税。* +
**这原本是为了鼓励农业生产，支持英国的农民。到了19世纪中期，这在英国引发了大量的问题，因为食品价格极高 (犹如美国对他国施行高关税, 本意是保护本国产业, 但在本国产业真正兴起之前, 实则会造成外国进口商品价格上涨, 本国物价通胀上升)，**而且每当出现干旱或饥荒——比如爱尔兰大饥荒（Irish Potato Famine）——食品价格就变得极其昂贵，这损害了工人的利益。 +

*英国废除《谷物法》使得进口谷物增加，这导致不列颠群岛内对"农业工人生产谷物"的需求减少，进而使得英国从以农业为主导的经济（农耕经济）, 转变为工业制造经济 (想当时被逼着"产业升级"了, 从低端第一产业, 迈向第二产业)。* +

此外，这也促进了自由贸易的兴起，这极大地巩固了英国的经济主导地位。 +

英国的经济学家和政治家, 在第一次工业化浪潮中表现得非常明智。当工厂最初在利兹（Leeds）和曼彻斯特（Manchester）等地兴起和发展时，他们把工厂的利润重新投入到工厂中，这样就能拥有更好、更高效的机器，进而使得越来越多的工厂积累了更多的财富。 +

以至于在1851年，英国决定举办大博览会（Great Exhibition）。你们可以把它想象成欧洲的世界博览会，它在水晶宫（Crystal Palace）举行——公平地说，水晶宫非常漂亮，令人印象深刻，但可惜后来被大火烧毁了。 +
从本质上说，大博览会是英国向欧洲其他国家展示：“看看我们有多厉害。看看我们创造的所有东西。看看我们能生产什么。你们做到这些了吗？没有。” +

不，公平地说，其他国家没有做到，因为欧洲其他国家走向工业化的步伐要缓慢得多。这同样是由于他们在环境、经济和政治方面的因素。 +
地理因素造就了当今的世界，所以**南欧和东南欧工业发展的不足，**实际上是因为缺乏自然资源。而且**该地区的经济模式仍然主要基于农奴制，**这也无济于事。 +
但总的来说，对于那些工业化进程较慢的国家来说，原因要么是他们没有像英国那样得到政府的支持，要么是他们的政治体系仍然以土地贵族为基础，而不是商业财富。 +

在第五单元，我们谈到了英国的崛起。而在第六单元——哦——英国即将统治整个世界。正如人们所说，大英帝国（British Empire）是 “日不落帝国”。 +
**法国的政治不稳定，尤其是在法国大革命之后，导致了它发展的滞后。**但你们知道在欧洲大陆上哪个国家在工业发展方面进展得非常好吗？哇哦，是俄罗斯。但我们下次再讲这个。 +

希望这对你们有帮助。同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 6.2: The Spread of Industry Throughout Europe.

The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain because of its environmental, political, and economic advantages. Let's break those three things down.

Environmentally, geographically, Britain just lucked out. They happened to have an abundance of coal that was very close to the surface and a ton of iron deposits. And not only that, they had navigable waterways like canals and rivers that allowed for easy transportation.

Oh, and helpfully enough, those waterways fueled water mills and then the water frame -- both of which led to eventually the steam engine.

Economically, Britain had ascended, as we talked about in last unit. Britain had a ready supply of colonies in India and also in the Americas, and they were using those colonies to produce cotton which they then shipped back to England.

Students, it is no coincidence why the Industrial Revolution started in the textile industry. Plus, Britain's economic history of having joint stock companies and early -- essentially -- venture capitalists created a pretty favorable climate for new inventors to create new things that would make them more money.

Parliament really supported industrialization because it's going to give Britain as a whole more power. Yes, but a lot of people who worked in Parliament also realized that they could potentially profit extraordinary sums off of sponsoring and supporting industrialization, so of course they are going to do that.

A huge example of government support of industry through commercial factors is the repeal of the Corn Laws. Now, the Corn Laws had been in effect to protect British farmers. They essentially placed really high tariffs on any sort of grain -- "corn" in this sense means grain, not literal stalks of corn -- coming into Britain.

And that was supposed to encourage agricultural production and support farmers and protect farmers in Britain. By the mid-1800s, that was leading to an incredible amount of problems in Britain because food prices were super high, and whenever there was a drought or a famine -- like, I don't know, the Irish Potato Famine -- food prices were exorbitant, and that hurt the workers.

The repeal of the Corn Laws in Britain led to an increase in imported grains, which led to a decrease in the need for agricultural workers to produce that grain within the British Isles, which then led to Britain transitioning from an agricultural-dominated economy -- an agrarian economy -- to an industrial manufacturer economy.

Also, it contributes to the rise of free trade, which really helps support Britain's economic dominance.

British economists and British politicians are being incredibly smart with this first wave of industrialization. When the factories first start to arise and develop in places like Leeds and Manchester, because they start to take the profits -- the proceeds of those factories -- and then pump them back into the factories so they can have better and more efficient machines, which then leads to more and more wealth in more and more factories.

So much so that in 1851, Britain decides to host the Great Exhibition. You can think of this like a European World's Fair, and it was held at their Crystal Palace -- which, to be fair, would have been something beautiful and incredibly impressive to look at, but too bad it burned down in a fire.

Essentially, the Great Exhibition was Britain saying to the rest of Europe: "Look how great we are. Look at all the things we've created. Look what we can produce. Have you done any of this? No."

But in general, for the countries that took a little bit longer to industrialize, it's because they didn't have the same governmental support as Britain did, or it's because their political systems were still rooted in landed aristocracy and not commercial wealth.

In unit five, we talked about how Britain had ascended. And in unit six -- ooh -- Britain is about to take over the whole world. As they say, the sun never sets on the British Empire.

Political instability in France, especially after their French Revolution, led to their lack of development. But you know who had a really great time at industrial development in Europe on the continent? Woo, Russia. But we'll get there next time.

I hope this helped. And students, as always, you can do it. I believe in you.
