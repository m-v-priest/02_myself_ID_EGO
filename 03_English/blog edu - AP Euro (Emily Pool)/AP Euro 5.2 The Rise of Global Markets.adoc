Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 5.2: The Rise of Global Markets 全球市场的兴起. +

Now the learning objective 学习目标 here is: explain the causes and consequences 原因和结果 of European maritime exploration 欧洲海上探险 from 1648 to 1815, which means we're going to be focusing on 专注于 the historical thinking skill causation 因果关系（历史思维技能）. +

Causation 因果关系 is looking at -- you guessed it -- causes and effects 原因和影响. And students, it's important to know that the word consequences 结果 does not only mean negative effects 负面影响 -- it just means effects in general 一般意义上的影响. +

Let's break this down 分解 by those two big categories 类别. First, let's talk about causes 原因 of European maritime competition 欧洲海上竞争. And y'all, you guessed it -- it's trade 贸易. +

Mercantilism 重商主义, the demand for trade goods 对贸易商品的需求, the desire for profit 对利润的渴望 -- all lead to 导致 increasing conflict 日益加剧的冲突 among European states 欧洲国家 for control of trade 控制贸易. And the desire to control maritime trade 海上贸易 specifically 特别地 is concomitant with 与…相伴；伴随 the rise in 兴起 new naval technologies 新的海军技术 and new navies 新的海军 and a military buildup 军事集结. +

The Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约 -- that significant marker date 重要标志性日期 that ends our first time period 时期 in AP European History -- really signals 标志着 the end of religious conflict 宗教冲突的结束 in Europe for a long time. So now that people aren't spending money to fund 资助 religious wars 宗教战争, what are they doing? Well, they are spending money to make as much money as possible 尽可能多地赚钱 by controlling trade routes 贸易路线. +

It should be no surprise to you, students, that the 1650s to the 1750s are considered the Golden Age of Piracy 海盗黄金时代. I mean, think about what these European merchants 商人 are shipping 运输 across the Atlantic 大西洋 and the Pacific 太平洋 in these giant boats 巨轮. Manila galleons 马尼拉大帆船 were a real thing. +

And these commercial rivalries 商业竞争 -- rivalries over commerce 商业竞争 AKA 也就是 trade -- are going to influence 影响 yes, diplomacy 外交（trying to make treaties 签订条约 to make sure that companies or objects are protected 确保公司或物品得到保护） but are also definitely influencing warfare 战争. +

While this learning objective 学习目标 is specifically talking about maritime competition 海上竞争 -- so sea-based competition 基于海洋的竞争 -- land-based competition 基于陆地的竞争 like the Seven Years' War 七年战争 and the War of Austrian Succession 奥地利王位继承战争 are also greatly impacting 极大地影响 what these countries are then doing with their navies 海军 in the ocean.

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题5.2：全球市场的兴起。 +

这里的学习目标是：解释1648年至1815年欧洲海上探索的原因和后果，这意味着我们将专注于历史思维技能中的因果关系。 +
因果关系就是关注——你们猜对了——原因和影响。同学们，要知道 “后果” 这个词不只是指负面影响——它指的是总体上的影响，这一点很重要。 +

我们按两个大的类别, 来剖析这个问题。首先，我们谈谈**欧洲海上竞争的原因。**你们都猜到了——*是贸易*。 +
**重商主义（Mercantilism）、对贸易商品的需求、对利润的渴望——所有这些都导致欧洲各国为控制贸易而产生的冲突日益加剧。**而对海上贸易控制权的渴望，与新的海军技术、新海军的兴起, 以及军事力量的增强, 相伴而生。 +

*《威斯特伐利亚和约》*（Peace of Westphalia）——这个重要的标志性日期, 结束了AP欧洲历史课程中我们学习的第一个时期——*真正标志着##欧洲宗教冲突在很长一段时间内的结束。那么，既然人们不再把钱花在资助宗教战争上，他们在做什么呢？嗯，他们把钱花在通过控制贸易路线,## 来尽可能多地赚钱上。* +

同学们，**17世纪50年代, 到18世纪50年代, 被认为是海盗的黄金时代，**这一点你们应该不意外。我的意思是，想想那些欧洲商人用大船跨越大西洋和太平洋运输的货物。马尼拉大帆船（Manila galleons）可是真实存在的。 +
*这些商业竞争——也就是贸易竞争——不仅影响外交（试图签订条约, 以确保公司或物品得到保护），而且肯定也影响着战争。* +

虽然这个学习目标专门讨论的是海上竞争——也就是基于海洋的竞争——但像七年战争（Seven Years' War）和奥地利王位继承战争（War of Austrian Succession）这样基于陆地的竞争，也极大地影响着这些国家在海洋上使用海军的方式。但我们下次再详细讲这个。 +

所以我希望这对你们有帮助。同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 5.2: The Rise of Global Markets.

Now the learning objective here is: explain the causes and consequences of European maritime exploration from 1648 to 1815, which means we're going to be focusing on the historical thinking skill causation.

Causation is looking at -- you guessed it -- causes and effects. And students, it's important to know that the word consequences does not only mean negative effects -- it just means effects in general.

Let's break this down by those two big categories. First, let's talk about causes of European maritime competition. And y'all, you guessed it -- it's trade.

Mercantilism, the demand for trade goods, the desire for profit -- all lead to increasing conflict among European states for control of trade. And the desire to control maritime trade specifically is concomitant with the rise in new naval technologies and new navies and a military buildup.

The Peace of Westphalia -- that significant marker date that ends our first time period in AP European History -- really signals the end of religious conflict in Europe for a long time. So now that people aren't spending money to fund religious wars, what are they doing? Well, they are spending money to make as much money as possible by controlling trade routes.

It should be no surprise to you, students, that the 1650s to the 1750s are considered the Golden Age of Piracy. I mean, think about what these European merchants are shipping across the Atlantic and the Pacific in these giant boats. Manila galleons were a real thing.

And these commercial rivalries -- rivalries over commerce AKA trade -- are going to influence yes, diplomacy (trying to make treaties to make sure that companies or objects are protected) but are also definitely influencing warfare.

While this learning objective is specifically talking about maritime competition -- so sea-based competition -- land-based competition like the Seven Years' War and the War of Austrian Succession are also greatly impacting what these countries are then doing with their navies in the ocean. But we're going to get to that more next time.

So I hope that this helped. And as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.
