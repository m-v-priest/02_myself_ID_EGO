== 释义

Hey students, let's talk about one of my favorite historical developments 历史事件: the English Civil War 英国内战. +

Okay, you know how your teacher inevitably 不可避免地 has like a favorite person and a favorite event? We know that my favorite person is Katherine de Medici, queen of my heart, and my favorite historical development 历史事件 is the English Civil War 英国内战. +

Now, there are only two things that the AP test actually needs you to know about the English Civil War 英国内战, and it is this: number one, the monarchy 君主制；君主政体 is fighting against not the monarchy for political power 政治权力. Number two, the outcome 结果；后果 of the war -- the effect of the English Civil War 英国内战 -- is that the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命 and the English Bill of Rights 英国权利法案 asserted 宣称；断言 forever that the monarchy 君主制；君主政体 has to coincide 一致；相符 and work with that other source of power that was competing against it, AKA 也就是；即 Parliament 议会. +

You are just watching this video to cover the exact things that you need to know for AP European History 欧洲历史. You can stop right now because I have told you exactly what the CED (Curriculum and Exam Description，课程与考试说明) needs you to know, which is the fact that the English Civil War 英国内战 exemplified 是…的典范；例证了 the competition for power 权力争夺 among monarchs 君主 and competing groups 竞争团体, and that the outcome 结果 of the English Civil War 英国内战 and the subsequent 随后的 Glorious Revolution 光荣革命 forever protected the rights of gentry 绅士 and aristocracy 贵族 from absolutism 专制主义 in England through assertions 主张；维护 of the rights of Parliament 议会权利. +

But students, we know that history is about the story, so just come with me as I tell you a tale 故事. +

Always, students, let me start out with some contextualization 背景介绍. The nobility 贵族 forced King John to sign the Magna Carta 大宪章. This guarantees 保证；确保 the rights of nobility 贵族 and limits 限制 the power of the king, and it exists to varying degrees of success 不同程度地成功 over the course of English history 英国历史进程中. +

But there's one thing that you need to know: in 1295, under his Model Parliament 模范议会, King Edward I sets up the idea of the parliamentary power of the purse 议会财权, which means that if the monarch 君主 wants to raise taxes 征税 in England to, I don't know, fund a war 为战争提供资金, the monarch 君主 needs to consult 咨询；商议 Parliament 议会 first. +

This continues on until Elizabeth I is the queen. But then Elizabeth I dies without an heir 继承人, so what does Parliament 议会 do? What does England do? They say, "Um, you know, let's just ask Elizabeth's cousin James VI of Scotland to come in and rule as James I of England." And he does, and this ushers in 引入；迎来 the Stuart family tree 斯图亚特家族. +

James I rolls up to Parliament 议会 like, "What? What is this governing body 统治机构? No, no, I am the king of England now. I would like to rule absolutely 独裁统治." And then a bunch of Catholics 天主教徒 in England who are upset with 对…不满 the Protestant 新教的 monarchy 君主制 try to blow up 炸毁 James and also Parliament 议会 in the Gunpowder Plot 火药阴谋. But then it fails, and then England actually removes 取消 the Catholic 天主教徒 right to vote 投票权. +

Now, students, this is where it gets interesting because during the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 in units four and really five, history likes to look at England as this notable 著名的；显著的, beautiful example of enlightened religious toleration 开明的宗教宽容. And yeah, they are -- if you're not Catholic 天主教徒. Keep that in mind 记住 because I'm going to bring that up again at the end of this video. +

James I tries to rule absolutely 独裁统治, and then he dies. And James I's son, Charles I, then also tries to follow in his father's footsteps 效仿他父亲. But here's the deal: Charles competes a lot more with Parliament 议会 than his dad did. +

Charles is like, "Hey Parliament 议会, how about you just like give me some money for taxes?" And Parliament 议会's like, "Cool, Charles, we'll do that, but please stop dissolving 解散 us." And Charles is like, "Sounds great, and now you're dissolved." +

This just continues back and forth 反复来回, and Charles tries to circumvent 绕过；规避 Parliament 议会 in order to raise money for taxes 通过这种古老的中世纪税收 called ship money 船税. The Petition of Right 权利请愿书 happens, the Triennial Act 三年法案 happens, and really, TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read，长话短说), Parliament 议会 and Charles get in so much conflict 冲突 that Charles ends up heading north 前往北方 to form an army 组建军队 to fight against Parliament 议会 so that he can have all the power. +

This leads us to the English Civil War 英国内战. And what I love about the AP test is that they do not care about the battles 战役, and neither do I, so let's move right on. +

In the English Civil War 英国内战, you have two factions 派别；派系 emerge 出现: number one is the Parliamentarians 议会派, AKA 也就是 the Roundheads 圆颅党, AKA 也就是 those who support Parliament 议会. On the other side, you have the Royalists 保皇派, AKA 也就是 the Cavaliers 骑士党, AKA 也就是 those who support Charles I. +

Now, this is going to be mainly the nobility 贵族 and the wealthy elites 富有的精英阶层. Of course they're going to want to support the power of the monarchy 君主制. And this is going to be mainly like townspeople 市民, merchants 商人, artisans 工匠, lower class 下层阶级 -- you know, they want their rights protected 权利得到保护. +

My most fun fact about the word "Cavalier" 骑士党 is that the word "Cavalier" 骑士党 comes from the fact that they were rich enough to have a horse to ride into battle 骑马参战, so they had a cavalry 骑兵部队, AKA 也就是 they are the Cavaliers 骑士党. +

Charles I and his forces 军队 end up losing to 输给 Oliver Cromwell and the Parliamentarians 议会派. And then Oliver Cromwell captures 俘虏 Charles I. And just put a pin in that -- we're just, he's hanging out somewhere. Just keep that in the back of your brain 记住这件事. +

We got to talk about Oliver Cromwell now. Oliver Cromwell gets a really bad rap 名声不好 in history, and to be fair 公平地说, it's kind of well deserved 罪有应得 for a lot of reasons. But Oliver Cromwell was a very strict version of Protestant 新教徒 called Puritan 清教徒. +

Oliver Cromwell believed that having too much fun could lead to sin 罪恶, so he did things like mandate 强制规定 dress codes 着装规范, enforce 执行 a Sunday Sabbath 安息日, and like, those who got caught working on a Sunday actually were put in stocks 戴上足枷. Banned 禁止 sports, banned 禁止 any holiday that wasn't Christmas -- I mean, Easter not allowed 不允许, Christmas celebrations 庆祝活动 not allowed. You can go to worship service 礼拜仪式, but you are not allowed to have a dinner 聚餐, you're not allowed to have Christmas parties 圣诞派对. +

Oliver Cromwell is ruling as Lord Protector 护国公 while Charles I is captured 俘虏 and imprisoned 监禁. And then Oliver Cromwell fills Parliament 议会 with his loyal followers 忠诚的追随者 in what becomes known as the Rump Parliament 残缺议会. +

And then once he has filled Parliament 议会 with his followers, he then says, "Hey Parliament 议会, let's vote on 投票决定 what to do with Charles I." They vote on regicide 弑君 -- one of my favorite words in AP European History 欧洲历史 -- the death of a king 国王之死. +

To be fair 公平地说, Charles I did raise an army against Parliament 议会, so yeah, he did commit treason 叛国, and the punishment for treason 叛国罪 would be death, so maybe it does make a little bit of sense as to why Oliver beheaded 斩首 Charles I first. +

And with the king now dead, Oliver Cromwell is like, "Huh, who's going to lead this new country? I guess I will." And then he goes on campaign 征战 in Scotland and Ireland and then leads to the deaths -- whether directly or indirectly -- of like 10 to 40% of those populations 人口. +

Oliver Cromwell dies. His son Richard rules for like a second after him, and then England's like, "I don't know about this weird thing. Let's just restore the monarchy 君主制 with Charles I's son, Charles II, who was in exile 流亡 during this time." +

Charles II comes back to England and is called the Merry Monarch 快乐君主 because, let's be real, he undoes 废除 a lot of the puritanical laws 清教法律 that Oliver Cromwell had set into place 制定. +

Charles II also realizes that he cannot make the same mistakes that his father did that led to the English Civil War 英国内战, so he takes it upon himself to actually really work well with Parliament 议会 when he's alive. +

Fun fact about Charles II is that he was married and she did not have any kids. He had an illegitimate son 私生子 out of wedlock 非婚生 that did not count 不算数. And I love -- I love the fact that Charles II did not divorce his wife because she did not produce an heir 继承人 for him. +

When we think about English history, we think about Henry VIII and his six wives and how he was like on this royal quest 王室追求 to find a male son who could rule after him. And again, hilarious 滑稽的, hilarious that it was Mary and Elizabeth who helped rule England and not Edward, who died relatively young. +

Anyway, when Charles II dies without an heir 继承人, rule is passed to his brother, James II. James is Catholic 天主教徒. England does not want a Catholic monarch 天主教君主. England is like, "No, no, we broke away from the Catholic Church 脱离天主教会 for a reason." +

So when James is in power 掌权, things are going okay, and Parliament 议会's like, "You know what? We can have one Catholic king. It won't be an entrenched Catholic monarchy 根深蒂固的天主教君主制, and then when he dies, we'll go back to being Protestant 新教的." +

But then James has a son, and Parliament 议会's like, "Oh no, what do we do about this?" So then Parliament 议会's like, "Hey, what if we ask James II's daughter Mary, who is conveniently married to William of Orange of the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国, to come replace James II and rule as co - monarchs 共治君主, also solidifying 巩固 an Anglo-Dutch alliance 英荷联盟?" +

It happens, and it was bloodless 不流血的, and that is called the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命. And their overthrow 推翻 of James II was justified 证明…有理 in the English Bill of Rights 英国权利法案. +

This English Bill of Rights 英国权利法案 not only justifies the deposition 废黜 of James II but also clarifies 阐明；澄清 the relationship between a monarch 君主 and Parliament 议会 -- AKA 也就是 they are going to work together for all of the rest of England's history. +

The English Bill of Rights 英国权利法案 signals 标志着 the end of any attempt at absolutism 专制主义 in the 1600s until now. Okay? +

But students, one of the conditions 条件 of the English Bill of Rights 英国权利法案, which was signed in 1689, is that the monarch 君主 in every subsequent 随后的 monarch must be a Protestant 新教徒 and cannot marry a Catholic 天主教徒. +

When we think about the idea of England as this religiously tolerant 宗教宽容的 nation -- y'all, yeah, but not to Catholics 天主教徒. I want you to keep that in the back of your mind 记住 as we progress throughout the next unit when we talk about the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 and then subsequently 随后 what's going to happen in France. +

Speaking of France, students, 144 years before the French behead 斩首 Louis XVI, England fought a civil war 内战 and voted to behead its king. Why was the French Revolution 法国大革命 given all of the credit 得到所有赞誉? Well, maybe because it was the one that was inspired by those Enlightenment ideals 启蒙思想 from the 1700s. +

But students, again, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke -- it was because of the English Civil War 英国内战 that they developed their new political standings 政治立场. +

Anywho, France shouldn't get all the credit 赞誉. Long live the English Civil War 英国内战. James, Charles, Charles, James. All right, as always, you can do it. I believe in you. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，咱们来聊聊我最喜欢的历史事件之一：英国内战（English Civil War）。 +
好吧，你们知道你们的老师不可避免地会有一个最喜欢的历史人物, 和一个最喜欢的历史事件吧？你们知道我最喜欢的人物是凯瑟琳·德·美第奇（Katherine de Medici），我心中的女王，而我最喜欢的历史事件就是英国内战。 +

现在，**关于英国内战，**AP考试实际上只要求你们了解两件事，是这样的：*第一，"君主制势力"和"非君主制势力", 在争夺政治权力。第二，这场战争的结果——#英国内战的影响——是"光荣革命"（Glorious Revolution）和《权利法案》（English Bill of Rights）, 永远地确立了"君主"必须与另一个与之竞争的权力来源（也就是"议会"（Parliament））合作。#* +

你们看这个视频, 只是为了了解AP欧洲历史考试要求你们掌握的内容。你们现在可以停下来了，因为我已经准确地告诉了你们课程大纲（CED）要求你们知道的内容，也就是**英国内战体现了君主和与之竞争的团体之间的权力争夺，**并且英国内战以及随后的**光荣革命的结果, 是通过"议会权利"的主张, 永远地保护了绅士和贵族免受"专制主义"（absolutism）的侵害。** +

但是，同学们，我们知道历史是关于故事的，所以就跟着我，我给你们讲个故事。 +
同学们，我总是要先介绍一下时代背景。**贵族们迫使约翰国王（King John）签署了《大宪章》（Magna Carta）。这保障了贵族的权利，限制了国王的权力，**并且在英国历史进程中，它在不同程度上发挥了作用。 +

但有一件事你们需要知道：**1295年，在"模范议会"（Model Parliament）的框架下，**爱德华一世（King Edward I）*#确立了议会的"财政权"概念，这意味着如果君主想要在英国征税，比如说为战争提供资金，君主需要先咨询议会。#* +

**这种情况一直持续到伊丽莎白一世（Elizabeth I）当女王。**但后来伊丽莎白一世去世且没有继承人，那么议会做了什么呢？英国又做了什么呢？他们说：“嗯，你知道的，我们请伊丽莎白的表亲苏格兰的詹姆斯六世（James VI of Scotland）来统治，他成为了英格兰的**詹姆斯一世（James I）。” 他来了，这开启了斯图亚特家族（Stuart family）的统治。** +

詹姆斯一世来到议会，他说：“什么？这个统治机构是什么？不，不，我现在是英格兰国王。我想要绝对统治。” 然后英国的一群对"新教"君主制不满的天主教徒, 试图通过火药阴谋（Gunpowder Plot）炸毁詹姆斯一世和议会。但阴谋失败了，而且**英国实际上取消了天主教徒的投票权。** +

同学们，从这里开始就有意思了，因为在第四单元以及第五单元所讲的**启蒙运动（Enlightenment）时期，历史常常把英国视为"宗教宽容"的杰出典范。是的，他们确实是——如果你不是天主教徒的话。**记住这一点，因为我在这个视频结尾还会提到。 +

詹姆斯一世试图进行绝对统治，然后他去世了。詹姆斯一世的儿子查理一世（Charles I）也试图追随他父亲的脚步。但情况是这样的：*查理一世与议会的竞争, 比他父亲更激烈。* +
查理一世说：“嘿，议会，你们给我一些税收资金怎么样？” 议会说：“行啊，查理，我们会给你钱，但请别解散我们。” 查理一世说：“听起来不错，现在你们被解散了。” +

这种情况反复出现，*查理一世试图绕过议会，通过一种古老的中世纪税收（叫做船税（ship money））来筹集税收资金。*《权利请愿书》（Petition of Right）出现了，《三年法案》（Triennial Act）也出现了，长话短说，*议会和查理一世冲突不断，查理一世最终北上组建军队与"议会"作战，这样他就能掌握所有权力。* +
**这就引发了英国内战。**我喜欢AP考试的一点是，他们不关注战争本身，我也不关注 (而关注战争带来的政治上的结果和意义)，所以我们接着往下说。 +

**在英国内战中，出现了两个派别：**第一派是议会派（Parliamentarians），也叫圆颅党（Roundheads），也就是支持议会的人。另一方是保皇派（Royalists），也叫骑士党（Cavaliers），也就是支持查理一世的人。 +
现在，*"保皇派"主要是贵族和富有的精英。当然，他们想要支持君主的权力。而"议会派"主要是市民、商人、工匠和下层阶级的人——你们知道的，他们想要自己的权利得到保护。* +
关于 “骑士党（Cavalier）” 这个词，我知道一个很有趣的事实，这个词源于他们足够富有，能够骑着马参战，所以他们有骑兵（cavalry），也就是说他们是骑士党。 +

**查理一世和他的军队, 最终输给了奥利弗·克伦威尔（Oliver Cromwell）和"议会派"。**然后奥利弗·克伦威尔俘虏了查理一世。先记住这件事——他被关押在某个地方。把这件事记在你们脑子里。 +

现在我们得说说奥利弗·克伦威尔。**奥利弗·克伦威尔在历史上名声不太好，**说句公道话，从很多方面来看他确实是罪有应得。但**奥利弗·克伦威尔是"新教"中一个非常严格的派别"清教徒"（Puritan）的成员。** +
**奥利弗·克伦威尔认为，过度享乐会导致犯罪，**所以他制定了一些规定，比如强制规定着装规范，强制实行"周日安息日"制度，而且那些被抓到在周日工作的, 人实际上会被关进颈手枷里。他禁止体育运动，除了圣诞节之外禁止任何节日——我的意思是，不允许庆祝复活节，也不允许庆祝圣诞节。你可以去做礼拜，但不允许举行晚宴，也不允许举办圣诞派对。 +

**奥利弗·克伦威尔以"护国公"（Lord Protector）的身份进行统治，而查理一世被俘虏并被关押。**然后**奥利弗·#克伦威尔让他的忠实追随者进入了议会(成为了议员, 即控制了国会)#，**这个议会后来被称为残余议会（Rump Parliament）。 +
然后，*一旦他让他的追随者进入议会后，他就说：“嘿，议会，我们来投票决定怎么处置查理一世吧。” 他们投票决定弑君*——这是AP欧洲历史中我最喜欢的词之一——也就是处死国王。 +

说句公道话，**查理一世确实组建军队对抗议会，所以，是的，他犯了叛国罪，而叛国罪的惩罚就是死刑，**所以奥利弗先斩首查理一世也有点道理。 +
**国王死了之后，奥利弗·克伦威尔想：“嗯，谁来领导这个新国家呢？我想应该由我来。” **然后他在苏格兰和爱尔兰发起了战役，直接或间接地导致了这些地区10%到40%的人口死亡。 +

**奥利弗·克伦威尔去世后。**他的儿子理查德（Richard）继承了他的位置，但时间很短，**然后英国想：“我们不太喜欢这种奇怪的统治方式。我们还是恢复君主制吧，**让查理一世的儿子查理二世（Charles II）来统治，他当时流亡在外。” +
查理二世回到英国，被称为 “欢乐君主”，因为说真的，*他废除了奥利弗·克伦威尔制定的很多清教徒法律。* +
*查理二世也意识到他不能犯他父亲犯过的导致英国内战的错误，所以他努力与议会合作。* +

关于查理二世有个有趣的事实，他结了婚，但他的妻子没有孩子。他有一个私生子，但不被承认。我很喜欢这一点——我喜欢查理二世没有因为"妻子没有为他生下继承人"就和她离婚。 +

当我们想到英国历史时，我们会想到亨利八世（Henry VIII）和他的六任妻子，以及他为了找到一个能在他之后统治的男性继承人, 所做的努力。而且很有意思的是，最终是玛丽（Mary）和伊丽莎白（Elizabeth）帮助统治了英国，而不是英年早逝的爱德华（Edward）。 +

不管怎样，**当查理二世去世且没有继承人时，统治权传给了他的弟弟詹姆斯二世（James II）。詹姆斯二世是天主教徒。英国不想要一个天主教君主。**英国说：“不，不，我们脱离天主教会是有原因的。” +
所以当詹姆斯二世掌权时，一开始情况还可以，议会说：“你知道吗？我们可以有一个天主教国王。只要不是一个根深蒂固的天主教君主制就行，*等他去世后，我们再恢复"新教"统治。*” +

但**后来詹姆斯二世有了一个儿子，议会说：“哦，不，我们该怎么办呢？” 所以议会说：“嘿，如果我们邀请詹姆斯二世的女儿玛丽（Mary）来取代詹姆斯二世，和荷兰共和国（Dutch Republic）的奥兰治的威廉（William of Orange）一起作为"共治君主"统治，同时巩固英荷联盟，怎么样呢？**” +
*这件事发生了，而且是不流血的，这就是"光荣革命"（Glorious Revolution）。并且他们推翻詹姆斯二世的行为, 在《权利法案》中有了正当理由。* +

*#《权利法案》不仅为推翻詹姆斯二世提供了正当理由，还明确了"君主"和"议会"之间的关系——也就是说，在英国此后的历史中，他们要合作。#* +
**#《权利法案》标志着17世纪任何"专制主义"企图的终结。#**明白了吗？ +

但是，同学们，*#1689年签署的《权利法案》有一个条件，那就是此后的每一位君主都必须是新教徒，并且不能和天主教徒结婚。#*  (中国当时则是刚刚清朝收复台湾后不久. 1683年，施琅攻台湾，郑克塽投降。) +

**当我们认为英国是一个宗教宽容的国家时——大家，是的，但对天主教徒可不宽容。**当我们进入下一单元讨论"启蒙运动",以及随后法国发生的事情时，请记住这一点。 +

说到法国，同学们，在法国斩首路易十六（Louis XVI）的144年前，英国打了一场内战, 并且投票决定斩首他们的国王。为什么"法国大革命"得到了所有的赞誉呢？嗯，也许是因为它受到了18世纪启蒙思想的启发。 +
但是，同学们，再说一次，托马斯·霍布斯（Thomas Hobbes）、约翰·洛克（John Locke）——正是因为英国内战，他们才确立了新的政治立场。 +

不管怎样，法国不应该得到所有的赞誉。英国内战万岁。詹姆斯，查理，查理，詹姆斯。好了，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, let's talk about one of my favorite historical developments: the English Civil War.

Okay, you know how your teacher inevitably has like a favorite person and a favorite event? We know that my favorite person is Katherine de Medici, queen of my heart, and my favorite historical development is the English Civil War.

Now, there are only two things that the AP test actually needs you to know about the English Civil War, and it is this: number one, the monarchy is fighting against not the monarchy for political power. Number two, the outcome of the war -- the effect of the English Civil War -- is that the Glorious Revolution and the English Bill of Rights asserted forever that the monarchy has to coincide and work with that other source of power that was competing against it, AKA Parliament.

You are just watching this video to cover the exact things that you need to know for AP European History. You can stop right now because I have told you exactly what the CED needs you to know, which is the fact that the English Civil War exemplified the competition for power among monarchs and competing groups, and that the outcome of the English Civil War and the subsequent Glorious Revolution forever protected the rights of gentry and aristocracy from absolutism in England through assertions of the rights of Parliament.

But students, we know that history is about the story, so just come with me as I tell you a tale.

Always, students, let me start out with some contextualization. The nobility forced King John to sign the Magna Carta. This guarantees the rights of nobility and limits the power of the king, and it exists to varying degrees of success over the course of English history.

But there's one thing that you need to know: in 1295, under his Model Parliament, King Edward I sets up the idea of the parliamentary power of the purse, which means that if the monarch wants to raise taxes in England to, I don't know, fund a war, the monarch needs to consult Parliament first.

This continues on until Elizabeth I is the queen. But then Elizabeth I dies without an heir, so what does Parliament do? What does England do? They say, "Um, you know, let's just ask Elizabeth's cousin James VI of Scotland to come in and rule as James I of England." And he does, and this ushers in the Stuart family tree.

James I rolls up to Parliament like, "What? What is this governing body? No, no, I am the king of England now. I would like to rule absolutely." And then a bunch of Catholics in England who are upset with the Protestant monarchy try to blow up James and also Parliament in the Gunpowder Plot. But then it fails, and then England actually removes the Catholic right to vote.

Now, students, this is where it gets interesting because during the Enlightenment in units four and really five, history likes to look at England as this notable, beautiful example of enlightened religious toleration. And yeah, they are -- if you're not Catholic. Keep that in mind because I'm going to bring that up again at the end of this video.

James I tries to rule absolutely, and then he dies. And James I's son, Charles I, then also tries to follow in his father's footsteps. But here's the deal: Charles competes a lot more with Parliament than his dad did.

Charles is like, "Hey Parliament, how about you just like give me some money for taxes?" And Parliament's like, "Cool, Charles, we'll do that, but please stop dissolving us." And Charles is like, "Sounds great, and now you're dissolved."

This just continues back and forth, and Charles tries to circumvent Parliament in order to raise money for taxes through this old medieval tax called ship money. The Petition of Right happens, the Triennial Act happens, and really, TLDR, Parliament and Charles get in so much conflict that Charles ends up heading north to form an army to fight against Parliament so that he can have all the power.

This leads us to the English Civil War. And what I love about the AP test is that they do not care about the battles, and neither do I, so let's move right on.

In the English Civil War, you have two factions emerge: number one is the Parliamentarians, AKA the Roundheads, AKA those who support Parliament. On the other side, you have the Royalists, AKA the Cavaliers, AKA those who support Charles I.

Now, this is going to be mainly the nobility and the wealthy elites. Of course they're going to want to support the power of the monarchy. And this is going to be mainly like townspeople, merchants, artisans, lower class -- you know, they want their rights protected.

My most fun fact about the word "Cavalier" is that the word "Cavalier" comes from the fact that they were rich enough to have a horse to ride into battle, so they had a cavalry, AKA they are the Cavaliers.

Charles I and his forces end up losing to Oliver Cromwell and the Parliamentarians. And then Oliver Cromwell captures Charles I. And just put a pin in that -- we're just, he's hanging out somewhere. Just keep that in the back of your brain.

We got to talk about Oliver Cromwell now. Oliver Cromwell gets a really bad rap in history, and to be fair, it's kind of well deserved for a lot of reasons. But Oliver Cromwell was a very strict version of Protestant called Puritan.

Oliver Cromwell believed that having too much fun could lead to sin, so he did things like mandate dress codes, enforce a Sunday Sabbath, and like, those who got caught working on a Sunday actually were put in stocks. Banned sports, banned any holiday that wasn't Christmas -- I mean, Easter not allowed, Christmas celebrations not allowed. You can go to worship service, but you are not allowed to have a dinner, you're not allowed to have Christmas parties.

Oliver Cromwell is ruling as Lord Protector while Charles I is captured and imprisoned. And then Oliver Cromwell fills Parliament with his loyal followers in what becomes known as the Rump Parliament.

And then once he has filled Parliament with his followers, he then says, "Hey Parliament, let's vote on what to do with Charles I." They vote on regicide -- one of my favorite words in AP European History -- the death of a king.

To be fair, Charles I did raise an army against Parliament, so yeah, he did commit treason, and the punishment for treason would be death, so maybe it does make a little bit of sense as to why Oliver beheaded Charles I first.

And with the king now dead, Oliver Cromwell is like, "Huh, who's going to lead this new country? I guess I will." And then he goes on campaign in Scotland and Ireland and then leads to the deaths -- whether directly or indirectly -- of like 10 to 40% of those populations.

Oliver Cromwell dies. His son Richard rules for like a second after him, and then England's like, "I don't know about this weird thing. Let's just restore the monarchy with Charles I's son, Charles II, who was in exile during this time."

Charles II comes back to England and is called the Merry Monarch because, let's be real, he undoes a lot of the puritanical laws that Oliver Cromwell had set into place.

Charles II also realizes that he cannot make the same mistakes that his father did that led to the English Civil War, so he takes it upon himself to actually really work well with Parliament when he's alive.

Fun fact about Charles II is that he was married and she did not have any kids. He had an illegitimate son out of wedlock that did not count. And I love -- I love the fact that Charles II did not divorce his wife because she did not produce an heir for him.

When we think about English history, we think about Henry VIII and his six wives and how he was like on this royal quest to find a male son who could rule after him. And again, hilarious, hilarious that it was Mary and Elizabeth who helped rule England and not Edward, who died relatively young.

Anyway, when Charles II dies without an heir, rule is passed to his brother, James II. James is Catholic. England does not want a Catholic monarch. England is like, "No, no, we broke away from the Catholic Church for a reason."

So when James is in power, things are going okay, and Parliament's like, "You know what? We can have one Catholic king. It won't be an entrenched Catholic monarchy, and then when he dies, we'll go back to being Protestant."

But then James has a son, and Parliament's like, "Oh no, what do we do about this?" So then Parliament's like, "Hey, what if we ask James II's daughter Mary, who is conveniently married to William of Orange of the Dutch Republic, to come replace James II and rule as co-monarchs, also solidifying an Anglo-Dutch alliance?"

It happens, and it was bloodless, and that is called the Glorious Revolution. And their overthrow of James II was justified in the English Bill of Rights.

This English Bill of Rights not only justifies the deposition of James II but also clarifies the relationship between a monarch and Parliament -- AKA they are going to work together for all of the rest of England's history.

The English Bill of Rights signals the end of any attempt at absolutism in the 1600s until now. Okay?

But students, one of the conditions of the English Bill of Rights, which was signed in 1689, is that the monarch in every subsequent monarch must be a Protestant and cannot marry a Catholic.

When we think about the idea of England as this religiously tolerant nation -- y'all, yeah, but not to Catholics. I want you to keep that in the back of your mind as we progress throughout the next unit when we talk about the Enlightenment and then subsequently what's going to happen in France.

Speaking of France, students, 144 years before the French behead Louis XVI, England fought a civil war and voted to behead its king. Why was the French Revolution given all of the credit? Well, maybe because it was the one that was inspired by those Enlightenment ideals from the 1700s.

But students, again, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke -- it was because of the English Civil War that they developed their new political standings.

Anywho, France shouldn't get all the credit. Long live the English Civil War. James, Charles, Charles, James. All right, as always, you can do it. I believe in you.
