Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 6.7: Ideologies of Change and Reform Movements (AKA the "isms") 变革意识形态与改革运动（又名“主义”）. +

Students, what I actually need you to do right now is take out a sheet of paper for notes 拿出一张纸做笔记 because I need to talk to you about the political spectrum 政治光谱. Because everything that happens starting now for the rest of this course will fall somewhere in line 处于…范围内 in this political spectrum, and when I use these terms 术语, you need to understand what I'm talking about. +

So on your sheet of paper, students, I need you to draw a line 画一条线. And in the middle, you are going to make a little tick mark 小标记 and you're going to write the word "moderate 温和派". Moderates 温和派 are in the middle of the political spectrum 政治光谱中间. +

Slightly 稍微地 to the right of that, you are going to write the word "conservative 保守派". Conservatives 保守派 want to keep things the way that they are 维持现状. They want the status quo 现状 to remain unchanged -- whether that's politically 政治上, economically 经济上, or socially 社会上. They do not desire change 渴望改变 because the way that the world is going in their eyes 在他们看来 is great. +

Further 更远地 to the right of conservatives, I need you to draw another tick mark and write the word "reactionary 反动分子". Reactionaries 反动分子 look at the way that the world is right now and say, "No, no, things were better a long time ago. We need to go back to what it was like before." +

At the right side of that political spectrum, you have conservatives saying, "We're fine now," and reactionaries saying, "We were fine a hundred years ago." +

Going back to your line, on the left side of moderate, draw a tick mark and write the word "liberal 自由派". Liberals 自由派 desire change 渴望变革, and they desire small change 小变革 through government interaction 通过政府干预. Often times, this is passing new laws 通过新法律 to protect rights of people 保护人民权利. +

So if we're looking at the Industrial Revolution 工业革命, a lot of liberals were pushing for 推动 new working hours 工作时间 or wage laws 工资法 that protected the working class 工人阶级. So unlike conservatives, liberals look at how things are going right now and they say, "Actually, things could be better. We could move forward and progress 进步 in certain ways." +

Back to that line, on the left of liberal, I need you to draw a tick mark and write the word "radical 激进派". Radicals 激进派 want extreme change 极端变革 as quickly as possible 尽快 and will do anything to make that happen. +

Radicals 激进派 are kind of dependent on 取决于 their time period 时代. It was radical 激进的 in Britain in the 1800s to think that every male should have a right to vote 选举权. Was absolutely radical at the time to think that women should be allowed really anywhere in the political sphere 政治领域. +

A lot of the conflict 冲突 that ensues 随之发生 in this unit and later units is between liberals who want change and conservatives who want to keep things the same. +

Liberals like John Stuart Mill emphasize 强调 popular sovereignty 人民主权 -- so rule by the people 人民统治 -- and individual rights 个人权利 that must be protected by the government. +

Radicals specifically in Britain like the Chartists 宪章派人士 demand 要求 universal male suffrage 男性普选权 -- not based on how much wealth you have or what family you came from. And some people like the French utopian socialist 法国空想社会主义者 Flora Tristan believe that these universal voting rights 普选权 should also be extended toward 扩大到 women. +

Speaking of 说到 socialism 社会主义, let's now talk about the economic spectrum 经济光谱. And students, I again need you to draw a line in your notes. This time it's going to be vertical 垂直的. This line indicates 表明 government involvement in the economy 政府对经济的干预. +

I'm going to give you a very basic overview of 概述 capitalism 资本主义 at the top, socialism 社会主义 in the middle, and let's put communism 共产主义 at the bottom. +

Capitalism 资本主义 is an economic system 经济制度 based on 基于 private ownership 私有制. People or entrepreneurs 企业家 own land 土地, labor 劳动力, and capital 资本 and combine those things to profit as much as possible 尽可能获利. +

If we're looking at the Industrial Revolution 工业革命, this makes the most sense 最合理. Those factory owners 工厂主 are using land, labor, and their resources 资源 to produce more resources which then makes them money. +

In capitalism, businesses can compete against each other 相互竞争 for profit 利润, which tends to 往往会 keep prices down for consumers 为消费者降低价格. But especially during the Industrial Revolution, capitalism also results in 导致 a very unequal wage gap 不平等的工资差距. +

You have the factory owners who have all the money, you have this emerging middle class 新兴中产阶级, and you have the factory workers 工厂工人 -- the bulk of society 社会主体 who, especially as industrialization was first taking off 刚开始发展, had nothing. +

And because capitalism when left unchecked 不受约束 can promote that uneven wage gap 不均衡的工资差距, socialists 社会主义者 emerge 出现 trying to even that out more 使差距更均衡. +

Socialism 社会主义 argues 主张 that through government involvement 通过政府干预, that wage gap 工资差距 will decrease 缩小 because the government might be owning some of the land, labor, or capital 拥有部分土地、劳动力或资本. Or in the modern day 在现代, governments who operate under a socialist economy 社会主义经济体制下的政府 heavily tax people 对民众大量征税 in order to even out that wage disparity 工资差距. +

But this is not just for the government to keep money for themselves 据为己有. They are then giving it back to their citizens 通过 things like healthcare 医疗 or housing 住房 or education 教育. +

And communists 共产主义者 take this a step further 更进一步. They say, "Hey, this like lowering of the wage gap 缩小工资差距 is not enough. You know what we need to have happen? Everyone share everything equally 平均分享一切." +

Private property 私有财产 is abolished 废除. We don't need any of that anymore because left to our own devices 任其自然, we will all share everything we need perfectly. +

Which is great in theory 理论上 -- like, I love the idea that we're all just kumbaya-ing 和睦相处 and holding hands together. But students, you all know that one person who would just take control of everything and steal from everyone else -- which is why communism doesn't work. +

And also because when a government controls a communist economy 共产主义经济, the government just keeps all of the money for themselves 把钱都据为己有. +

With that foundation set 奠定基础, let's talk about Karl Marx 卡尔·马克思 and Marxism 马克思主义. Karl Marx, co-author of 《…的共同作者》The Communist Manifesto 《共产党宣言》, focused on 关注 how in a capitalist system 资本主义制度, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few 集中在少数人手中 -- the bourgeoisie 资产阶级 -- at the expense of 以…为代价 the working class -- the proletariat 无产阶级. +

Marx believed that society evolved 发展 based on economic systems 经济制度. He believed that feudalism 封建主义 naturally gave way to 让位于 capitalism, and that capitalism would naturally give way to socialism and ultimately communism 共产主义. +

And he argued 认为 that those things naturally happen because of class struggle 阶级斗争 -- this conflict 冲突 between the working class and the owning class 有产阶级. +

As he says in The Communist Manifesto: "The history of all hitherto existing society 迄今为止的一切社会历史 is the history of class struggle 阶级斗争的历史. Freeman and slave 自由民和奴隶, patrician and plebeian 贵族和平民, lord and serf 领主和农奴 -- or in a word 总之, oppressor and oppressed 压迫者和被压迫者." +

In his scientific socialism 科学社会主义 and subsequent critique of capitalism 对资本主义的批判, he literally studied history and economic development 研究历史和经济发展 to prove why capitalism existed and why it was not the best economic form 经济形式. +

And students, many women became socialists 社会主义者, utopian socialists 空想社会主义者, or Marxists 马克思主义者 in light of 鉴于 their relative equality 相对平等. I mean, Marx believed that women and men were completely equal 完全平等, which was a radical political stance 激进的政治立场 at the time. +

And led to people like Clara Zetkin 克拉拉·蔡特金 and Rosa Luxemburg 罗莎·卢森堡 leading communist parties 领导共产党 or eventually being murdered by the Berlin conservative police 被柏林保守派警察杀害, respectively 分别地. +

The last "ism" that I want to talk about here is anarchism 无政府主义, which is the idea that governments do not need to exist 政府无需存在 because all governments are corrupt 腐败的. +

Mikhail Bakunin 米哈伊尔·巴枯宁 himself became disillusioned with 对…失望 socialism and communism because he believed as soon as a capitalist government was overthrown 推翻 and replaced with 被…取代 a socialist government, the socialist government would also be corrupt and unnecessary. +

So unlike utopian socialists 空想社会主义者 who believe they should just become their own tiny little communities away from society 脱离社会建立小社区, Bakunin argued that underground movements 地下运动 were necessary to live and revolt against 反抗 the government at hand 现政府. +

Rather than 而不是 all property being controlled by a government, all property needed to be controlled by workers who then worked collectively together 集体劳动, and therefore government was not needed because they provided all of the things that they needed for themselves 自给自足. +

We got the "isms." I hope that helped. I know this was a little bit of a longer one, but as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来聊聊主题6.7：变革的意识形态, 与改革运动（也称为“主义”）。 +

同学们，我现在需要你们**拿出一张纸**来做笔记，因为我要给你们讲讲**政治光谱。**因为从现在开始，在本课程**剩下的内容里发生的所有事情，都会落在这个政治光谱的某个位置上，**当我使用这些术语时，你们需要明白我在说什么。 +

所以，同学们，在你们的纸上，我要你们**画一条线。在这条线的中间，做一个小小的标记，然后写上“温和派”这个词。温和派处于政治光谱的中间位置。** +

*在这条线“温和派”稍微偏右的位置，写上“保守派”这个词。保守派希望保持事物的现状。他们希望政治、经济或社会方面的现状维持不变。他们不渴望变革*，因为在他们眼里，世界现在的样子就很好。 +

**在保守派更往右的位置，我要你们再画一个标记，然后写上“反动派(复古派)”这个词。反动派看着世界现在的样子会说：“不，不，很久以前的情况更好。我们需要回到过去的样子。” **+

在这个政治光谱的右侧，保守派会说：“我们现在这样就挺好的”，而反动派会说：“我们一百年前的情况才好呢”。 +

回到你们画的那条线上，*在“温和派”的左侧画一个标记，然后写上“自由派”这个词。自由派渴望变革，他们希望通过政府的干预, 实现小幅度的变革。通常情况下，这表现为通过新的法律来保护人们的权利。* +
所以，如果我们看看**工业革命，很多自由派推动制定新的工作时间或工资法律, 来保护工人阶级。**所以与保守派不同，自由派看着现在的情况会说：“实际上，事情可以变得更好。我们可以在某些方面取得进步。” +

再回到那条线上，*在“自由派”的左侧画一个标记，然后写上“激进派”这个词。激进派希望尽可能快地实现极端的变革，并且会为了实现变革不惜一切代价。* +
激进派在不同的时期有不同的表现。在19世纪的英国，认为每个男性都应该有投票权是激进的想法。认为女性应该在政治领域的各个方面都有参与权，在当时绝对是激进的观点。 +

在本单元以及后续单元中出现的**很多政治上的冲突，都发生在渴望变革的自由派, 和希望维持现状的保守派之间。** +

像约翰·斯图尔特·密尔（John Stuart Mill）这样的**自由派强, 调人民主权——也就是人民统治——以及必须由政府保护的个人权利。** +

在英国，像宪章运动者（Chartists）这样的激进派, 要求男性普选权——这种普选权不基于你拥有多少财富, 或你的出身。像法国"空想社会主义者"（utopian socialist）弗洛拉·特里斯坦（Flora Tristan）这样的人认为，这些普选权,也应该扩展到女性身上。 +

说到社会主义，**现在让我们来谈谈"经济光谱"。**同学们，我再次需要你们在笔记上**画一条线。这次这条线是垂直的。这条线表示政府对经济的干预程度。** +
我要给你们一个非常基本的概述，*最上面是资本主义（capitalism），中间是社会主义（socialism），最下面是共产主义（communism）。* +

**资本主义是一种基于"私有制"的经济体系。**人们或企业家拥有土地、劳动力和资本，并将这些要素结合起来尽可能地获取利润。 +
如果我们看看工业革命，资本主义在这种情况下是最说得通的。那些工厂主利用土地、劳动力和他们的资源, 来生产更多的资源，进而赚钱。 +

在资本主义制度下，企业为了利润相互竞争，这往往会使消费者面临的物价降低。但特别是在工业革命期间，资本主义也导致了巨大的工资差距。 +
有拥有所有财富的工厂主，有新兴的中产阶级，还有工厂工人——社会的大部分人，特别是在工业化刚刚兴起的时候，他们一无所有。 +

*由于不受约束的资本主义, 会加剧这种工资差距，社会主义者出现了，他们试图让这种差距变得更小。* +
*社会主义认为，通过政府的干预，工资差距会缩小，因为政府可能会拥有一些土地、劳动力或资本。或者在现代，实行社会主义经济的政府会对人们征收重税，以缩小工资差距。* +
但这并不是说政府把钱都据为己有。他们会通过医疗保健、住房或教育等方式, 把钱回馈给公民。 +

**而共产主义者更进一步。**他们说：“嘿，仅仅缩小工资差距是不够的。你们知道我们需要发生什么吗？*每个人都应该平等地分享一切。*” +
**"私有财产"被废除。**我们不再需要私有财产，因为如果让我们自行其是，我们会完美地分享我们所需要的一切。 +
这在理论上很棒——就像，我喜欢我们大家和睦相处、携手共进的想法。但是同学们，你们都知道会有这样的人，*他们会控制一切,并从其他人那里窃取东西 (假公济私, 人性是贪婪的, 是靠不住的)*——这就是共产主义行不通的原因。 +
*而且当一个政府控制共产主义经济时，政府会把所有的钱都据为己有 (土地国有化, 谁是国? 不存在抽象上的国, 只有人)。* +

在奠定了这些基础之后，让我们谈谈卡尔·马克思（Karl Marx）和马克思主义（Marxism）。《共产党宣言》（The Communist Manifesto）的共同作者卡尔·马克思，关注的是在资本主义制度下，财富如何集中在少数人——资产阶级——手中，而以工人阶级——无产阶级——为代价。 +
**马克思认为, 社会是基于经济体系发展演变的。**他认为封建主义自然地让位于资本主义，而资本主义会自然地让位于社会主义，最终是共产主义。 +

他认为这些事情自然发生, 是因为阶级斗争——也就是工人阶级和统治阶级之间的冲突。 +
正如他在《共产党宣言》中所说：“**至今一切社会的历史都是阶级斗争的历史。**自由民和奴隶、贵族和平民、领主和农奴——*一句话，压迫者和被压迫者。*” +
在他的科学社会主义, 以及随后对资本主义的批判中，他切实地研究了历史和经济发展，以证明资本主义存在的原因, 以及为什么它不是最好的经济形式。 +

同学们，许多女性因为相对平等的理念, 成为了社会主义者、空想社会主义者, 或马克思主义者。我的意思是，**马克思认为男女完全平等，**这在当时是一个激进的政治立场。 +
这导致像克拉拉·蔡特金（Clara Zetkin）和罗莎·卢森堡（Rosa Luxemburg）这样的人, 分别领导共产党，或者最终被柏林的保守派警察杀害。 +

我在这里要讲的最后一个“主义”是**"无政府主义"（anarchism），其观点是政府不需要存在，因为所有政府都是腐败的。** +
米哈伊尔·巴枯宁（Mikhail Bakunin）本人**对社会主义和共产主义感到失望，因为他认为一旦资本主义政府被推翻，由"社会主义政府"取而代之，而"社会主义政府"也会腐败且没有存在的必要。** +

所以，与"空想社会主义者"认为他们应该建立自己独立于社会的小社区不同，巴枯宁认为, 地下运动对于生存和反抗现政府是必要的。 +
*不是让政府控制所有财产，而是让工人控制所有财产，然后集体合作，因此政府是不必要的，因为他们可以自行提供所需要的一切。* +

我们讲了这些“主义”。希望这对你们有帮助。我知道这个内容有点长，但同学们，一如既往，你们能理解这些知识的。我相信你们。 +
