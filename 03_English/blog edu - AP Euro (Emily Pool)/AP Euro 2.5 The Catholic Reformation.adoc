Baroque art 巴洛克艺术 should re-energize 使重新充满活力 the faithful 信徒 and should deepen the spiritual experience 深化精神体验 -- all about the dramatic 戏剧性的 and a focus on emotion 情感 and dramatic spiritual expression 戏剧性的精神表达. If you look at the inside of some of these Baroque churches, it's supposed to simulate 模拟 heaven on Earth 人间天堂.
 +
We see gold everywhere, and if you were a peasant 农民 living in Europe in say, I don't know, the 1500s, you would recognize the spiritual and political authority 精神和政治权威 that the church had if you walked into a building that looked like this.

The Protestant Reformation happened in 1517, and the Catholic Church quickly responded with their own Counter-Reformation 反宗教改革运动 -- sometimes called the Catholic Reformation.

The Protestant Reformation doesn't only cause religious change, it also causes a ton of change in society, which is what we're going to get to next time.
 +
As always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·普尔（Emily Pool）。咱们来聊聊天主教改革（Catholic Reformation）吧。 +

首先，提一下我的这件衬衫。我是今年夏天在圣彼得大教堂（St. Peter's Basilica）的时候买的，这引出了一个很重要的点，因为我们需要谈谈教皇尤利乌斯二世（Pope Julius II）和米开朗基罗（Michelangelo）。 +

友情提醒一下，在15世纪末和16世纪初，像尤利乌斯二世这样的教皇通过出售赎罪券（sale of indulgences）来资助西斯廷教堂（Sistine Chapel）的相关事务, 或者圣彼得大教堂的建造。 +

**新教改革（Protestant Reformation）爆发了，它揭露了天主教会（Catholic Church）里各种各样的腐败现象，而天主教会**实际上也在特伦托会议（Council of Trent）上**做出了回应, 并进行了改革。** +

同学们，关于始于1534年的特伦托会议，我需要你们了解四件事。 +

第一：它强化并重申了传统的天主教教义。他们一致认为在天主教弥撒（Catholic mass）中，拉丁语仍然是礼拜用语。他们确认了《通俗拉丁文本圣经》（Vulgate version of the Bible）是天主教特定版本的《圣经》。他们认同在天主教会中，对圣物和宗教画像的崇拜, 实际上是重要的。而且最值得注意的是，*#他们说：“没错，实际上救赎是通过"善行"和"信仰"实现的，而不只是靠信仰。” 这与新教徒所宣扬的观点不同。#* +

第二：他们确实改革了过去几个世纪, 在天主教会中扎根的许多腐败的教会行为。*他们禁止出售赎罪券。他们禁止买卖圣职（simony）——也就是买卖教会职位，并且他们还要求主教居住在他们传教的地方。* +

第三：*他们试图通过发布《禁书目录》（Index of Prohibited Books）来遏制新教教会（Protestant church）不断增长的影响力。这是一份天主教当局认为对信仰有危险或有害的书籍清单。《禁书目录》从16世纪一直存在到1966年。* +

*这份禁书名单上被禁的作者包括: 尼可罗·马基雅维利（Niccolò Machiavelli）、约翰·洛克（John Locke）、托马斯·霍布斯（Thomas Hobbes）、让-雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）、德尼·狄德罗（Denis Diderot）、大卫·休谟（David Hume）、伊曼努尔·康德（Immanuel Kant）、杰里米·边沁（Jeremy Bentham）、伏尔泰（Voltaire）、孟德斯鸠（Montesquieu）、塞缪尔·理查森（Samuel Richardson）、丹尼尔·笛福（Daniel Defoe）、约翰·斯图尔特·密尔（John Stuart Mill）、大仲马（Alexandre Dumas）、埃米尔·左拉（Émile Zola）和西蒙娜·德·波伏娃（Simone de Beauvoir）。* +

同学们，你们可能在想：“这些名字我一个都不认识。” 别担心，到课程结束时你就会了解了。 +

第四：*他们试图让人们重新回归天主教信仰，并且他们通过两种方式来实现这一点。第一是委托建立新的宗教修会，比如耶稣会（Jesuits）, 或者乌尔苏拉修女会（Ursuline nuns）。第二是委托创作艺术品。* +

**耶稣会士是传教士，**他们非常注重精神虔诚以及教育。*#耶稣会士在美洲进行了大量的传教工作，但他们也在欧洲开展传教工作，以对抗"新教"的传播。#* +

*#巴洛克艺术#（Baroque art）应该让信徒们重新充满活力，并且应该##加深精神体验——一切都围绕着戏剧性，注重情感和戏剧性的精神表达。如果你看看一些巴洛克风格教堂的内部，它应该是在模拟人间天堂。##* +
**我们到处都能看到黄金，**而且**如果你是生活在比如16世纪欧洲的一个农民，当你走进这样一座建筑时，你会认识到教会所拥有的精神和政治权威 (被震撼)。** +

新教改革发生在1517年，而天主教会迅速做出回应，开展了他们自己的"反宗教改革"（Counter-Reformation）——有时也被称为天主教改革。 +

**#"新教改革"不仅引发了宗教变革，它还在社会上引发了大量的变革#，**这就是我们下次要讲的内容。 +
同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Hey students, it's Emily Pool. Let's talk about the Catholic Reformation.

Friendly reminder that popes in the late 1400s and early 1500s like Julius II were using the sale of indulgences to fund things like the Sistine Chapel or the construction of St. Peter's Basilica.

The Protestant Reformation breaks out, which calls out all sorts of corruption in the Catholic Church, and the Catholic Church actually does respond and reform in the Council of Trent.

And students, I need you to know four things about the Council of Trent that started in 1534.

Number one: It doubled down and reaffirmed traditional Catholic doctrine. They agreed that Latin is still the language of worship in a Catholic mass. They affirmed that the Vulgate version of the Bible is the specific Catholic version of the Bible. They agreed that the worship of relics and images was actually important within the Catholic Church. And maybe most notably, they said, "Yeah, actually salvation comes through works and faith, not just faith alone," which is what these Protestants were preaching.

And number four: They sought to bring people back to the Catholic faith, and they did this in two ways. Number one was commissioning new religious orders like the Jesuits or the Ursuline nuns. And number two was the commissioning of art.

Jesuits were missionaries that focused a lot on spiritual piety and also education. Jesuits were responsible for a lot of missionary work in the Americas, but they were also responsible for missionary work in Europe in order to combat the spread of Protestantism.

Baroque art should re-energize the faithful and should deepen the spiritual experience -- all about the dramatic and a focus on emotion and dramatic spiritual expression. If you look at the inside of some of these Baroque churches, it's supposed to simulate heaven on Earth.

We see gold everywhere, and if you were a peasant living in Europe in say, I don't know, the 1500s, you would recognize the spiritual and political authority that the church had if you walked into a building that looked like this.

The Protestant Reformation happened in 1517, and the Catholic Church quickly responded with their own Counter-Reformation -- sometimes called the Catholic Reformation.

The Protestant Reformation doesn't only cause religious change, it also causes a ton of change in society, which is what we're going to get to next time.

As always, students, you can do it. I believe in you.
