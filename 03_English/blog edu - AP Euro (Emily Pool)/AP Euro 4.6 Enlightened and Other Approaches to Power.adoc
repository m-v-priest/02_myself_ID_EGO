Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk all about topic 4.6: enlightened 开明的 and other approaches to power 权力的其他行使方式. +

Enlightenment philosophers 启蒙哲学家 like Locke 洛克, Voltaire 伏尔泰, and Montesquieu 孟德斯鸠 all propose 提出 new political ideology 政治意识形态 and new political thought 政治思想 about how a government should be run 政府应如何运作 and the relationship between a government and the people 政府与人民之间的关系. +

But where do those Enlightenment philosophies 启蒙哲学思想 take place 发生? Not in Western Europe 西欧. You think that Louis XIV 路易十四, the Sun King 太阳王, is going to want to give up 放弃 some of his absolute power 绝对权力 in order to get consent of the governed 被统治者的同意? Yeah, right. +

Instead, a lot of these new Enlightenment philosophies 启蒙哲学思想 happen in Central and Eastern Europe 中欧和东欧. Let's talk about it. +

Let's contextualize 把…置于背景中 a little bit. In 1713, the Pragmatic Sanction 国事诏书 is passed. Charles VI 查理六世, the Habsburg ruler 哈布斯堡统治者 at the time, did not have any male heirs 男性继承人, so this sanction 诏书 allowed female heirs 女性继承人 to rule over 统治 Habsburg lands 哈布斯堡领地. +

At his death, the female heir 女性继承人 that took over 接管 and then ruled for 40 years is none other than 正是 Maria Theresa 玛丽娅·特蕾莎. When this happens, the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国 -- this Habsburg rule 哈布斯堡统治 in Central Europe 中欧 -- starts to shift 转移 east to Austria 向东至奥地利, which allows for the rise of 崛起 Prussia 普鲁士. +

And as we remember from last unit, Prussia 普鲁士, Russia 俄国, and Austria 奥地利 were all gaining in power 增强实力 because they had partitioned 瓜分 Poland by the end of the 1700s. +

That brings me to the three enlightened absolute monarchs 开明的专制君主 that I want to talk about right now: Catherine II 叶卡捷琳娜二世, Joseph II 约瑟夫二世, and Frederick II 腓特烈二世. +

Now what's unique about 独特之处 these enlightened absolute rulers 开明的专制统治者 -- sometimes called enlightened despots 开明专制君主 -- is that they intentionally 有意地 choose what Enlightenment philosophies 启蒙哲学思想 they want to bring to their lands 带到他们的领地. +

Generally speaking 一般来说, these enlightened monarchs 开明君主 have four things in common 有四个共同点: they believe that the ruler should promote the good of the people 统治者应促进人民福祉, that people should have increasing access to education 人们应获得更多受教育机会, that religious toleration 宗教宽容 should exist, and that standardized legal codes 标准化法典 -- everyone being equal under their law 法律面前人人平等 -- is important. +

While they are bringing in 引入 and allowing some enlightened philosophies 启蒙哲学思想, they are still ruling absolutely 绝对统治, and that is not going to go away 消失 anytime soon in these lands. +

Students, as I go through 介绍 all of these enlightened monarchs 开明君主, you need to make sure that you in your brain are directly comparing and contrasting 直接比较和对比 them. On some skills practice 技能练习, specifically looking at similarities and differences 异同点 between Western Europe 西欧 and Eastern Europe 东欧 during this time with all these political changes 政治变革. +

Make sure that you check out 查看 my Ultimate Review Packet 终极复习资料包 linked in the description below. +

Let's start with this Russian monarch 俄国君主: Catherine II 叶卡捷琳娜二世, Catherine the Great 叶卡捷琳娜大帝. She became the sole leader 唯一统治者 of Russia after her husband died -- and she was probably involved in 与…有关 his death. +

Peter the Great 彼得大帝 had started this westernization 西方化 in Russia in the 1600s, and then when Catherine becomes tsarina 女沙皇, she continues that process 过程. She was a Francophile 亲法派 and loved French culture and language 法国文化和语言, and actually preferred speaking French over 宁愿说…而不愿说 Russian or German. +

If you remember from one of my previous videos, she sponsored 资助 Diderot 狄德罗 as her personal librarian 私人图书管理员 after she purchased his literary works 文学作品. +

Like many absolute monarchs 专制君主 at this time, she recognized the importance of education 教育的重要性 and abolished 废除 torture 酷刑. But unlike two of the other enlightened monarchs 开明君主 that we will learn about, she doubled down on 加强；坚持 strong social structures 社会结构 by oppressing 压迫 the serfs 农奴 in Russia. +

Students, now remember: as Western Europe 西欧 is creeping toward 逐渐走向 a market-based capitalistic economy 以市场为基础的资本主义经济, that is not the case 情况并非如此 in Eastern Europe 东欧. They are still deriving 获得 a lot of their wealth from 从…获取财富 agriculture 农业, specifically through the use of serfdom 农奴制. +

During Catherine's rule 统治时期, there was an uprising 起义 by a Cossack 哥萨克人 named Pugachev, and she just squashed 镇压 that uprising, which then served to 有助于 solidify 巩固 her role 地位 and the extremely low status 极低地位 of peasants 农民 in Russia during her rule. +

All right, let's move on to 继续介绍 Frederick II 腓特烈二世, AKA 又名 Frederick the Great 腓特烈大帝. Prior to 在…之前 Frederick II's reign 统治时期, Prussia 普鲁士 was emerging as 逐渐成为 a dominant military state 占主导地位的军事强国, and Frederick II continues that. +

He says, "I am a servant of the state 国家的公仆." I mean, he literally 确实 writes an essay called Anti-Machiavel 《反马基雅维利》 in which he critiques 批判 Machiavelli's The Prince 马基雅维利的《君主论》 chapter by chapter 逐章. +

Like Catherine, serfdom 农奴制 remains dominant 占主导地位 in Prussia during his reign. But also like Catherine, he was a patron of 赞助人 Voltaire 伏尔泰, and as a result 因此 cared a lot about 非常关心 freedom of speech 言论自由 and religious toleration 宗教宽容. +

And like Catherine who quoted 引用 Beccaria's On Crimes and Punishments 贝卡里亚的《论犯罪与刑罚》, Frederick also recognized the importance of abolishing torture 废除酷刑 in setting up 制定 legal codes 法典 that serve the benefit of the whole 为全体人民谋利益. +

As Huguenots 胡格诺派教徒 have fled 逃离 France and Spain due to 由于 religious persecution 宗教迫害, a lot of them find their way to 前往 Central Europe 中欧, specifically to Prussia 普鲁士, and Frederick uses that to his benefit 利用这一点. +

He creates compulsory education systems 义务教育体系 with a focus on 专注于 music 音乐, science 科学, and literature 文学. And now that he has more people to help support a standing army 常备军, he doubles down on 加强 the Prussian military 普鲁士军队, which just is a continuation 延续 in Prussian history 普鲁士历史 from now through Otto von Bismarck 奥托·冯·俾斯麦时期. +

We will end with 最后介绍 my favorite of the three enlightened absolute monarchs 三位开明专制君主中我最喜欢的: Joseph II 约瑟夫二世. Joseph II was the eldest son 长子 of Maria Theresa 玛丽娅·特蕾莎 and ruled over 统治 Austria 奥地利 at her death. +

Like Catherine and Frederick, he recognized the importance of education 教育的重要性, and it's during his reign 统治时期 that about 25% of school-aged children 学龄儿童 actually attended school 上学 in Austria. +

He abolished 废除 censorship 审查制度. He practices religious toleration 实行宗教宽容 by limiting reforms 限制改革 that had previously been placed on 之前施加于 Greek Orthodox Christians 希腊东正教徒 or Jews 犹太人. +

What sticks out the most 最突出的是 about him is that he actually advances 改善 the lives of peasants 农民生活 in Austria during his reign. Peasants are given property rights 财产权 and actually paid for their labor 劳动报酬 in cash 现金. Radical 激进的. +

I love using art 艺术 because art really serves as 作为 a visual anchor 视觉支撑, so I wanted to end with this. This is a picture of Maria Theresa's coffin 棺材, which is buried in 埋葬于 the Habsburg Imperial Crypt 哈布斯堡皇室墓穴 in Vienna 维也纳, and this is a picture of Joseph II's coffin. +

I want to talk about a change in enlightened rule 开明统治的变化 and proof of 证明 enlightened rule. Joseph recognizes that he can no longer be as ostentatious 炫耀的；铺张的 as his mother was because that's not the way the world works anymore 世界已今非昔比. He is more humble 谦逊的 -- or as Frederick would say, he is a servant of the state 国家的公仆. +

Last thought I want to leave you with 最后留给你们思考的是: Catherine II 叶卡捷琳娜二世 and Frederick II 腓特烈二世 are both known as 被称为 "the Great," but Joseph is not. Why do you think that is? +

If I'm going to rank 排名 the three of them in the most enlightened 最开明, Joseph would come first 第一, Frederick would come second 第二, and Catherine would come third 第三. +

While these French and English Enlightenment philosophers 启蒙哲学家 and their ideas really started to take root 扎根 in Eastern Europe 东欧 -- not in Western Europe 西欧 -- by the 1800s, most places in Western Europe 西欧大部分地区 were practicing more religious toleration 实行更多宗教宽容 than they had before. +

Rulers 统治者 in the mid-late 18th century 18世纪中后期 in Eastern Europe 东欧 adopt 采用 Enlightenment practices 启蒙运动的做法, and rulers in the west don't, which then leads to 导致 -- you know -- in France, revolution 革命. We'll get there when we get there. +

And as always, students, I hope this video helped. You can do it. I believe in you. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。我们来全面聊聊主题4.6：开明的以及其他的权力手段。 +

像洛克（Locke）、伏尔泰（Voltaire）和孟德斯鸠（Montesquieu）这样的启蒙哲学家，都提出了关于"政府应如何治理", 以及"政府与人民之间关系"的新政治意识形态和新政治思想。 +

**但这些启蒙哲学发生在哪里呢？**不是在西欧。你觉得太阳王路易十四（Louis XIV）会为了得到被统治者的认可, 而放弃他的部分绝对权力吗？想得美。 +
相反，**很多这些新的启蒙哲学发生在中欧和东欧。**我们来谈谈这个。 +

我们先来梳理一下时代背景。*1713年，《国事诏书》（Pragmatic Sanction）通过。当时的哈布斯堡统治者查理六世（Charles VI）没有男性继承人，所以这份诏书允许女性继承人统治哈布斯堡的土地。* +
他去世后，接管并统治了40年的女性继承人不是别人，正是玛丽娅·特蕾莎（Maria Theresa）。*这件事发生后，神圣罗马帝国（Holy Roman Empire）——中欧的哈布斯堡统治——开始向东转移到奥地利，这使得普鲁士得以崛起。* +
就像我们上一单元所学的，*普鲁士、俄罗斯和奥地利的势力都在增强，因为到18世纪末，他们瓜分了波兰。* +

这就引出了我现在想讲的**三位开明的专制君主：(俄国)叶卡捷琳娜二世（Catherine II）、(奥地利)约瑟夫二世（Joseph II）, 和 (普鲁士)腓特烈二世（Frederick II）。** +
*这些开明的专制统治者——有时被称为开明的独裁者——的独特之处在于，他们有意选择将哪些启蒙哲学引入他们的领地。* +

*一般来说，这些开明的君主有四点共同之处：1.他们认为统治者应该促进人民的利益，2.人民应该有更多接受教育的机会，3.应该存在宗教宽容，4.而且标准化的法律准则——法律面前人人平等——很重要。* +
虽然他们引入并允许一些启蒙哲学，但他们仍然实行"绝对统治"，而且这种情况在这些地区短期内不会消失。 +

同学们，当我介绍这些开明的君主时，你们要在脑海中对他们进行直接的比较和对比。在一些技能练习中，要特别关注这个时期, 西欧和东欧在政治变革方面的异同。 +
一定要查看我在下面描述中链接的终极复习资料包。 +

我们从这位俄罗斯君主开始讲起：叶卡捷琳娜二世，也就是叶卡捷琳娜大帝（Catherine the Great）。她在丈夫去世后, 成为了俄罗斯的唯一统治者——而且她可能与丈夫的死有关。 +
**彼得大帝（Peter the Great）在17世纪开启了俄罗斯的西方化进程，叶卡捷琳娜成为沙皇（tsarina）后，继续了这一进程。她是个亲法派，**热爱法国文化和语言，实际上她说法语比说俄语或德语还多。 +

如果你们还记得我之前的一个视频，她在购买了狄德罗（Diderot）的文学作品后，让狄德罗担任她的私人图书管理员。 +

和当时的许多绝对君主一样，她认识到了教育的重要性，并废除了酷刑。但与我们将了解的另外两位开明君主不同，她通过压迫俄罗斯的农奴, 来强化社会结构。 +
同学们，记住：*#当西欧逐渐走向以市场为基础的资本主义经济时，东欧的情况并非如此。他们仍然主要从农业中获取大量财富，特别是通过农奴制。#* +
在叶卡捷琳娜统治期间，一个叫普加乔夫（Pugachev）的哥萨克人发动了起义，而她镇压了这次起义，这巩固了她的统治地位，也巩固了在她统治下俄罗斯农民极低的社会地位。 +

好的，我们接着讲腓特烈二世，也就是腓特烈大帝（Frederick the Great）。在腓特烈二世统治之前，普鲁士逐渐成为一个占主导地位的军事国家，腓特烈二世延续了这一趋势。 +
他说：“我是国家的仆人。” 实际上，他写了一篇名为《反马基雅维利》（Anti-Machiavel）的文章，逐章批判了马基雅维利（Machiavelli）的《君主论》（The Prince）。 +

和叶卡捷琳娜一样，在他统治期间，普鲁士的农奴制依然占主导地位。但也和叶卡捷琳娜一样，他是伏尔泰的赞助人，因此非常重视言论自由,和宗教宽容。 +
就像叶卡捷琳娜引用贝卡里亚（Beccaria）的《论犯罪与刑罚》（On Crimes and Punishments）一样，腓特烈也认识到在制定有利于全体人民的法律准则时, 废除酷刑的重要性。 +

由于胡格诺派（Huguenots）因宗教迫害逃离法国和西班牙，很多人来到了中欧，特别是普鲁士，腓特烈利用了这一点。 +
他创建了义务教育体系，重点关注音乐、科学和文学。而且因为有更多的人来支持常备军，他强化了普鲁士军队，从那时起直到奥托·冯·俾斯麦（Otto von Bismarck）时期，这一直是普鲁士历史的延续。 +

我们以三位开明的绝对君主中, 我最喜欢的约瑟夫二世来结束。约瑟夫二世是玛丽娅·特蕾莎的长子，在她去世后统治奥地利。 +
和叶卡捷琳娜、腓特烈一样，他认识到了教育的重要性，在他统治期间，奥地利大约25%的学龄儿童实际上都上学了。 +
他废除了审查制度。他通过限制之前对希腊东正教徒或犹太人的改革, 来实行宗教宽容。 +
他最突出的一点是，在他统治期间，他确实改善了奥地利农民的生活。农民获得了财产权，而且实际上他们的劳动得到了现金报酬。这很激进。 +

我喜欢用艺术来举例，因为艺术真的可以作为一种视觉上的支撑，所以我想以此来结尾。这是玛丽娅·特蕾莎的棺材的照片，她被安葬在维也纳（Vienna）的哈布斯堡皇室墓穴（Habsburg Imperial Crypt），这是约瑟夫二世棺材的照片。 +

我想谈谈开明统治的变化, 以及开明统治的证明。约瑟夫认识到他不能像他母亲那样铺张，因为世界已经不是那样运转了。他更谦逊——或者用腓特烈的话来说，他是国家的仆人。 +

我想留给你们的最后一个思考是：叶卡捷琳娜二世和腓特烈二世都被称为 “大帝”，但约瑟夫却不是。你们觉得这是为什么呢？ +
如果要我给他们三个在开明程度上排序，约瑟夫排第一，腓特烈排第二，叶卡捷琳娜排第三。 +

*虽然这些法国和英国的启蒙哲学家及其思想, 真正在东欧生根发芽——而不是在西欧——但到19世纪时，西欧的大多数地方, 比以前更加实行"宗教宽容"了。* +
*18世纪中后期，东欧的统治者采用了启蒙运动的做法，而西欧的统治者没有，这就导致了*——你们知道的——**法国的革命。**我们之后会讲到。 +

同学们，希望这个视频对你们有帮助。你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Students, as I go through all of these enlightened monarchs, you need to make sure that you in your brain are directly comparing and contrasting them. On some skills practice, specifically looking at similarities and differences between Western Europe and Eastern Europe during this time with all these political changes.

Make sure that you check out my Ultimate Review Packet linked in the description below.

Let's start with this Russian monarch: Catherine II, Catherine the Great. She became the sole leader of Russia after her husband died -- and she was probably involved in his death.

Like Catherine and Frederick, he recognized the importance of education, and it's during his reign that about 25% of school-aged children actually attended school in Austria.

He abolished censorship. He practices religious toleration by limiting reforms that had previously been placed on Greek Orthodox Christians or Jews.

What sticks out the most about him is that he actually advances the lives of peasants in Austria during his reign. Peasants are given property rights and actually paid for their labor in cash. Radical.

I love using art because art really serves as a visual anchor, so I wanted to end with this. This is a picture of Maria Theresa's coffin, which is buried in the Habsburg Imperial Crypt in Vienna, and this is a picture of Joseph II's coffin.

I want to talk about a change in enlightened rule and proof of enlightened rule. Joseph recognizes that he can no longer be as ostentatious as his mother was because that's not the way the world works anymore. He is more humble -- or as Frederick would say, he is a servant of the state.

Last thought I want to leave you with: Catherine II and Frederick II are both known as "the Great," but Joseph is not. Why do you think that is?

If I'm going to rank the three of them in the most enlightened, Joseph would come first, Frederick would come second, and Catherine would come third.

While these French and English Enlightenment philosophers and their ideas really started to take root in Eastern Europe -- not in Western Europe -- by the 1800s, most places in Western Europe were practicing more religious toleration than they had before.

Rulers in the mid-late 18th century in Eastern Europe adopt Enlightenment practices, and rulers in the west don't, which then leads to -- you know -- in France, revolution. We'll get there when we get there.

And as always, students, I hope this video helped. You can do it. I believe in you.
