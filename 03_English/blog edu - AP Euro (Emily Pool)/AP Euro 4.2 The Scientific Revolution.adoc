Hey students, it's Emily P. Let's talk about topic 4.2: the Scientific Revolution 科学革命. +

Now, if you remember from my last video, it is important to note that these early scientists 科学家 were not trying to directly challenge 挑战 the power of the Catholic Church 天主教会. These scientists 科学家 were concerned in 专注于 figuring out 弄清楚 the intricacies 错综复杂；复杂细节 of how the world works 世界如何运转 because if they could do that, they could ascribe 把…归于 more glory to God 更多荣耀归于上帝. +

While the church deemed 认为 Galileo a heretic 异教徒 -- was he? I digress 离题；扯开话题. We need to start back into contextualizing 把…置于背景中 this with one of my least favorite historical characters of all time: Galen. +

Galen was a Roman physician 医生 who came up with 提出 the idea of the humoral theory of disease 体液致病理论. Students, picture this: in the body there are four humors 体液 or four liquids 液体. You got yellow bile 黄胆汁, black bile 黑胆汁, blood 血液, and phlegm 痰. And if those things are imbalanced 不平衡的 in your body, it means that something is wrong and you have diseases 疾病. +

Galen's solution to fixing any kind of bodily ailment 疾病 was to even out 使平衡 those humors somehow. But students, I need you to think about this: what's black bile? I don't know. What's yellow bile? I mean, urine 尿液? Cool. Okay. What's blood? We all got that. Phlegm? Okay. +

Which of those is the easiest to get rid of 去除 at any given time? Did you answer blood? Because that is correct. So what did this lead to 导致 in Europe from like, I don't know, the 400s to honestly the 1800s? Bloodletting 放血疗法. +

You might not be a scientist 科学家, but you as a teenager in today's world know that getting rid of 去除 blood in your body when you are sick does not help. So Galen is real questionable 可疑的 in my book. But it does then make me love Andreas Vesalius even more, because he and William Harvey dissected 解剖 humans once that was legal again. +

And then with their dissection 解剖 of humans, they were able to figure out 弄清楚 that the circulatory system 循环系统 is in fact 事实上 one connected system 相连的系统 within the body. But the fact that the body is an integrated system 完整的系统 went against 违背 Galen's humoral theories of disease 体液致病理论, which then made science better. +

That is looking at anatomy 解剖学 in the human body. But what about scientists 科学家 who are looking at the heavens 天空；天体? Let's talk about Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton. +

Polish astronomer 天文学家 Copernicus, right before he died, published this theory that is called the heliocentric theory 日心说 or sun-centered theory 以太阳为中心的理论, in which he posited 假定；提出 that the sun is the center of the solar system 太阳系 and not the Earth 地球. +

Galileo then proved 证明 Copernicus's heliocentric theory 日心说 with his telescope 望远镜, and then that got Galileo in a lot of trouble with the Catholic Church 天主教会. A continuation 延续 in European history from the start of this course until now: people like Galileo, like Martin Luther, do things that indirectly challenge 挑战 the power of the Catholic Church 天主教会, and the Catholic Church puts them on trial 审判. +

And in both cases 情况, the Catholic Church said, "Luther, Galileo, recant 撤回；放弃（信仰等）." Luther says no. Galileo says okay, and then he spends the rest of his life on house arrest 软禁. +

Galileo discovered that bodies will move in a straight line 直线 unless they are acted upon by 受…作用 some outside force 外力. And Kepler -- another scientist 科学家 that you need to know in this unit -- discovered that planets orbit 轨道运行 in ellipses 椭圆 around the sun 太阳. +

And y'all, it was Sir Isaac Newton who discovered that the one thing that can make both of these statements true at the same time is gravity 重力. His three laws of motion 运动定律 essentially 本质上 describe 描述 gravity and gravitational pull 引力. And also he invented 发明 calculus 微积分. +

And he wrote all that stuff down into a book called Principia Mathematica 《自然哲学的数学原理》. This Newtonian synthesis 牛顿综合体系 -- this bringing of ideas of Galileo and Kepler together into one coherent statement 连贯的阐述 that there is universal gravitational pull 万有引力 -- dominated 主导 scientific thought 科学思想 until the 20th century. +

There is a huge change from thought that dominated 主导 the Middle Ages 中世纪, which is that the Earth exists in one plane 平面 and the heavens exist in another plane 平面. And Newton, in his Newtonian synthesis 牛顿综合体系, is combining 结合 those things together -- that the heavens and the Earth are connected 相连的. +

By the way, Newton -- devout 虔诚的 Anglican 英国国教徒 -- he believed that God in His infinite wisdom 无限智慧 created the most beautiful and intricate 复杂精细的 world system that connects everything together. +

We've talked about the body. We've talked about gravity 重力 and the world. Let's talk about the scientific method 科学方法 in general. You're all high school students. You know what the scientific method 科学方法 is. Do you want to know who came up with that? Francis Bacon 弗朗西斯·培根. +

Prior to 在…之前 Bacon and his inductive method of reasoning 归纳推理法 -- which means that you start out with an observation 观察 and then test and experiment 测试和实验 based on that observation -- the thing that dominated 主导 scientific thought 科学思想 since Rome was Aristotle's idea of deductive reasoning 演绎推理法. +

Deductive reasoning 演绎推理法 is the opposite of 与…相反 inductive reasoning 归纳推理法. So you start with a general premise 前提 and then draw a specific conclusion 结论, whereas 然而 in inductive reasoning 归纳推理法 you have a specific premise 前提 -- your hypothesis 假设 -- and then you draw a conclusion 结论. +

Not sure if this helps, but I'm going to say it anyway. One of Aristotle's classic syllogisms 三段论 is that: all men are mortal 凡人；终有一死的；不能永生的; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is mortal. That is a great example of deductive reasoning 演绎推理法. +

And students, what you do in your science classes now is the opposite. You do inductive reasoning 归纳推理法. You do the scientific method 科学方法 starting with a hypothesis 假设. +

Both Francis Bacon 弗朗西斯·培根 and René Descartes 勒内·笛卡尔 -- don't worry, we're going to get to him later when we talk about the enlightenment 启蒙运动 -- work together to promote 促进 the reliance on 依赖 mathematics 数学 and experimentation 实验 in any scientific field 科学领域. +

While all of these changes are happening in the world of science 科学界, not everyone's on board 同意；参与. There are still traditional Aristotelian scientists 亚里士多德派科学家. There are still traditional alchemists 炼金术士. And a lot of these scientists 科学家 like Newton still believe that the cosmos 宇宙 is governed by 受…支配 spiritual forces 精神力量 or by some kind of supreme being 至高存在. +

Students, in just this one topic there are many people that you need to know according to the AP Euro CED 欧洲历史课程与考试说明. To end this video, let's see if we remember who they are and what they did. +

You need to know Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Harvey, Galen, Francis Bacon, and René Descartes. You should also know Kepler and Vesalius. +

If you didn't remember any of that or you just need extra help remembering people in general, please check out 查看 my Ultimate Review Packet 终极复习资料包 linked in the description below because it has everything that you need to be successful not only in your class but also in the AP test come May. +

Hope this helped, and as always, students, you can do it. I believe in you. +

== 中文释义

嘿，同学们，我是艾米丽·P。咱们来聊聊主题4.2：科学革命（Scientific Revolution）。 +

现在，要是你们还记得我上一个视频的内容，要注意这些早期的科学家并不是试图直接挑战天主教会（Catholic Church）的权力。这些科学家专注于弄清楚世界运行的复杂原理，因为如果他们能做到这一点，他们就能给上帝带来更多荣耀。 +

虽然教会判定伽利略（Galileo）是异教徒——他真的是吗？我跑题了。我们得从一个我一直以来最不喜欢的历史人物开始, 来梳理时代背景，这个人就是盖伦（Galen）。 +
**盖伦是一位罗马医生，他提出了疾病的"体液学说"。**同学们，想象一下：他认为**在人体内有四种体液,**或者说四种液体。*有黄胆汁、黑胆汁、血液和痰。如果这些东西在你体内失衡了，那就意味着出问题了，你就生病了。* +
盖伦解决任何身体疾病的方法, 就是以某种方式平衡这些体液。但是同学们，我希望你们思考一下：黑胆汁是什么呢？我不知道。黄胆汁是什么呢？我的意思是，是尿液吗？好吧。血液是什么呢？我们都知道。痰呢？好吧。 +

*在任何特定时候，这些东西中最容易排出体外的是哪个呢？你回答是血液吗？因为这个答案是正确的。所以从大概公元400年一直到19世纪的欧洲，这导致了什么呢？放血疗法（Bloodletting）。* +

你可能不是科学家，但作为当今世界的青少年，你知道生病时放血并不能帮助治疗。所以在我看来，盖伦的理论真的很值得怀疑。但这也让我更加喜欢安德烈亚斯·维萨里（Andreas Vesalius）了，因为他和威廉·哈维（William Harvey）在人体解剖合法化后, 进行了人体解剖。 +
然后通过他们的人体解剖，他们能够弄清楚"循环系统"实际上是人体内一个相互连接的系统。但人体是一个综合系统这一事实, 与盖伦的疾病体液理论相悖，而这让科学得到了发展。 +

刚才讲的是对人体解剖学的研究。但是那些研究天体的科学家呢？咱们来聊聊哥白尼（Copernicus）、伽利略和牛顿（Newton）。 +
波兰天文学家哥白尼在临终前发表了一种理论，即"日心说"（heliocentric theory），也就是以太阳为中心的理论，在这个理论中，他假定太阳是太阳系的中心，而不是地球。 +

然后伽利略用他的望远镜证明了哥白尼的日心说，这让伽利略与天主教会产生了很多矛盾。从本课程开始到现在的欧洲历史上一直存在这样的情况：像伽利略、马丁·路德（Martin Luther）这样的人做了间接挑战天主教会权力的事情，然后天主教会对他们进行审判。 +
在这两种情况下，天主教会都说：“路德，伽利略，公开撤回你们的观点。” 路德说不。伽利略说好吧，然后他余生都处于软禁状态。 +

伽利略发现, 物体在没有外力作用时, 会做直线运动。开普勒（Kepler）——本单元你们需要了解的另一位科学家——发现, 行星绕太阳的轨道是椭圆形的。 +

大家，是艾萨克·**牛顿（Isaac Newton）爵士发现了能同时让这两个观点成立的因素，那就是引力。**他的三大运动定律, 本质上描述了引力和万有引力。而且他还发明了微积分。 +
他把所有这些内容都写进了一本名为《自然哲学的数学原理》（Principia Mathematica）的书里。这种牛顿综合理论——把伽利略和开普勒的观点结合起来，提出存在万有引力 ——在20世纪之前一直主导着科学思想。 +

从中世纪占主导的思想来看，这是一个巨大的变化，中世纪认为地球存在于一个平面，而天体存在于另一个平面。而牛顿在他的"牛顿综合理论"中，把这些结合起来，认为天体和地球是相互连接的。 +

顺便说一下，牛顿是虔诚的英国国教徒（Anglican），他相信上帝以其无限的智慧创造了一个最美丽、最复杂的世界系统，这个系统把一切都连接在一起。 +

我们已经讨论了人体，也讨论了引力和世界。现在我们来总体谈谈"科学方法"。你们都是高中生。你们知道什么是科学方法。你们想知道**是谁提出"科学方法"的吗？是弗朗西斯·培根**（Francis Bacon）。 +
**在**培根和**他的"归纳推理"方法**（inductive method of reasoning）——*意思是你从一个观察结果出发，然后基于这个观察进行测试和实验——出现之前，自罗马时代以来主导科学思想的, 是亚里士多德（Aristotle）的"演绎推理"（deductive reasoning）思想。* +

*"演绎推理"与"归纳推理"相反。所以你从一个"一般性的前提"开始，然后得出一个具体的结论，而在"归纳推理"中，你从一个具体的前提——你的假设——出发，然后得出结论。* +

不确定这是否有帮助，但我还是要说。亚里士多德的一个经典三段论是：所有人都会死；苏格拉底（Socrates）是人；所以苏格拉底会死。这是"演绎推理"的一个很好的例子。 +
同学们，你们现在在科学课上做的是相反的事情。你们进行"归纳推理"。你们从一个假设开始运用科学方法。 +

弗朗西斯·培根, 和勒内·笛卡尔（René Descartes）——别担心，我们在讨论启蒙运动的时候会讲到他——共同努力推动了在任何科学领域, 对数学和实验的依赖。 +

虽然科学领域发生了所有这些变化，但并不是每个人都支持。仍然有传统的亚里士多德学派的科学家。仍然有传统的炼金术士。而且很多像牛顿这样的科学家, 仍然相信宇宙是由精神力量, 或某种至高无上的存在所支配的。 +

同学们，**根据AP欧洲历史课程大纲（AP Euro CED），在这一个主题中，有很多人物你们需要了解。**在这个视频结束时，让我们看看是否还记得他们是谁, 以及**他们做了什么贡献。** +
你们需要了解哥白尼、伽利略、牛顿、哈维（Harvey）、盖伦、弗朗西斯·培根, 和勒内·笛卡尔。你们也应该了解开普勒和维萨里。 +

要是你们不记得这些内容，或者总体上需要额外的帮助来记住这些人物，请查看我在下面描述中链接的终极复习资料包，因为它包含了你们在课堂上以及五月份的AP考试中取得成功所需的一切。 +
希望这对你们有帮助，同学们，一如既往，你们能做到的。我相信你们。 +

Which of those is the easiest to get rid of at any given time? Did you answer blood? Because that is correct. So what did this lead to in Europe from like, I don't know, the 400s to honestly the 1800s? Bloodletting.

You might not be a scientist, but you as a teenager in today's world know that getting rid of blood in your body when you are sick does not help. So Galen is real questionable in my book.

We've talked about the body. We've talked about gravity and the world. Let's talk about the scientific method in general. You're all high school students. You know what the scientific method is. Do you want to know who came up with that? Francis Bacon.

Prior to Bacon and his inductive method of reasoning -- which means that you start out with an observation and then test and experiment based on that observation -- the thing that dominated scientific thought since Rome was Aristotle's idea of deductive reasoning.

Deductive reasoning is the opposite of inductive reasoning. So you start with a general premise and then draw a specific conclusion, whereas in inductive reasoning you have a specific premise -- your hypothesis -- and then you draw a conclusion.

Not sure if this helps, but I'm going to say it anyway. One of Aristotle's classic syllogisms is that: all men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is mortal. That is a great example of deductive reasoning.

And students, what you do in your science classes now is the opposite. You do inductive reasoning. You do the scientific method starting with a hypothesis.

Both Francis Bacon and René Descartes -- don't worry, we're going to get to him later when we talk about the enlightenment -- work together to promote the reliance on mathematics and experimentation in any scientific field.

While all of these changes are happening in the world of science, not everyone's on board. There are still traditional Aristotelian scientists. There are still traditional alchemists. And a lot of these scientists like Newton still believe that the cosmos is governed by spiritual forces or by some kind of supreme being.

Students, in just this one topic there are many people that you need to know according to the AP Euro CED. To end this video, let's see if we remember who they are and what they did.

You need to know Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Harvey, Galen, Francis Bacon, and René Descartes. You should also know Kepler and Vesalius.
