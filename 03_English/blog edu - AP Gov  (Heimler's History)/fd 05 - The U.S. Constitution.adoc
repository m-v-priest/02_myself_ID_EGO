== 释义

Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at the next foundational document 基础文献 for AP Government, namely 即；也就是 the United States Constitution 美国宪法. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked republican 共和的 style, well then let's get to it. +

Okay, so let's start by reminding ourselves of the historical context 历史背景 into which this document was written. Now prior to 在…之前 the writing of the Constitution, the governing document 管理文件 for the United States was the Articles of Confederation 《邦联条例》. And if you want to watch a video explaining that document, it's right over here. Anyway, what you need to remember about that system of government is that most of the power was held by the states, and the central government -- which was made up of 由…组成 only a legislative branch 立法部门 -- was exceedingly 极其地 weak. +

And then because of all the cascading difficulties 一连串的困难 under the Articles, including Congress going broke 破产 and events like Shays' Rebellion 谢司起义, delegates 代表 gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft 起草 a new governing document. And that is how we got our Constitution. And the big idea when it comes to the Constitution is that it established a republican-style government 共和制政府 in contrast to 与…形成对比 the confederacy 邦联 established by the Articles. +

Now republican government is one in which representatives 代表 do the work on behalf of 代表 the people -- just in case you don't know. Now structurally 在结构上, the Constitution begins with a Preamble 序言, which is then followed by seven articles 条款. And here you can see the overarching topic 首要主题 of each article. Now we're not going to consider every article in detail, but I especially want to emphasize how this document solves the problems of the Articles of Confederation. And basically the way that it solved those problems was by investing 赋予 the central government with a metric butt load （俚语，大量）more power than it had under the Articles. +

So let's see how they did it. Article 1 deals with 涉及 the form and powers of Congress -- of the legislative branch of the federal government. Just let me add that Article 1 is the longest section in the Constitution, and that should tell you something. And what it should tell you is that most important to this new form of government was the branch that represented the people. +

Okay, so what power does Congress have? Well in a word, legislative or law-making powers 立法权. And you can see it right up front in Article 1: "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in 授予 a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of 由…组成 a Senate 参议院 and a House of Representatives 众议院." So right off the bat 立刻；马上, you can see a major difference between the Articles and the Constitution. Under the Constitution, the Congress would be formed into a bicameral legislature 两院制立法机构, which means that there would be two houses. In the Senate, each state is represented equally with two senators per state, and then in the House of Representatives, they are apportioned 分配 by population. +

And the most important section in Article 1 that you need to know is Section 8, in which the enumerated powers 列举的权力 of Congress are explicitly 明确地 outlined 概述. Here it says that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes 征税, to borrow money 借款, to coin money 铸造货币, to declare war 宣战, to raise and support armies 招募和供养军队, and maintain a navy 维持海军. There's a lot more there, but you get the idea. +

But probably the most important part of this section comes at the end, and it's known as the necessary and proper clause 必要和适当条款 -- or you might hear it called the elastic clause 弹性条款 -- same thing. It says that Congress has the power "to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution 执行 the foregoing powers 上述权力, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." +

Now I cannot emphasize enough 再怎么强调也不为过 just how explosive 具有爆炸性的 that sentence is, especially among those who liked the government under the Articles. What this sentence is saying is that okay, here are all the powers of the federal Congress, and we're going to name them explicitly so Congress doesn't get the idea that it can just make laws on anything its little heart desires. But then the necessary and proper clause comes around and says yeah, but if Congress needs to make any other laws that are necessary and proper to all of these powers, it has the power to do that. +

Now if that sounds vague 模糊的, it very much is. And it was that vagueness 模糊性 that really baked the biscuits of （俚语，激怒）those who opposed giving the federal government more power. They feared that the necessary and proper clause would give Congress the latitude 自由；回旋余地 to pass any law they wanted, even if it was not explicitly listed in Section 8. +

Okay, now we'll leave that there for a moment and move on to Article 2, which outlines 概述 the provisions 规定 for the executive branch 行政部门 -- or the president 总统. First it talks about the method of electing the president, which is by means of 通过 the Electoral College 选举人团. And then it goes on to list the explicit powers 明确的权力 of the president. The first power of the president is as follows in Section 2: "The President shall be commander in chief 总司令 of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia 民兵 of the several states." So the president can't declare war -- that power belongs to Congress -- but the president is the highest in the chain of command 指挥系统 of the military. +

Okay, then in Section 3 it says that "the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed 忠实地执行." So Congress passes laws, and the president is there to execute or enforce 执行；实施 them. Additionally 此外, the president is the final step in the law-making process 立法过程. Like once a bill 法案 passes through both houses of Congress, the president must sign it for it to become a law. +

Okay, and then Article 3 deals with the judicial branch 司法部门, and it says that "the judicial power 司法权 of the United States shall be vested in 授予 one Supreme Court 最高法院, and in such inferior courts 下级法院 as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish 设立；规定." So the Constitution provides for 规定 one federal Supreme Court, and then gives Congress the power to establish other courts, which it did in the Judiciary Act of 1789 1789年司法条例. +

Now with respect to 关于 how the Supreme Court works, it's important to know what kind of jurisdiction 管辖权 it is granted. Jurisdiction just indicates 表明 what kind of disputes 纠纷 are within the realm of 在…范围内 the court's power to decide. And Article 3 says that the court has two kinds of jurisdiction. First: "In all cases affecting ambassadors 大使, other public ministers 公使 and consuls 领事, and those in which a state shall be party 当事人, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction 初审管辖权." So in these cases, the court has original jurisdiction, which means that the Supreme Court can hear that case for the first time. However: "In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction 上诉管辖权." Appellate jurisdiction means that the court cannot hear a case for the first time, but can only hear appeals 上诉 from the lower courts 下级法院. And most of the cases the Supreme Court hears are appeals from lower courts. +

So we've said that the legislative branch 立法部门 is the one who makes the laws, and then the executive branch -- the president -- executes the laws, and then the judicial branch 司法部门 interprets 解释 the laws and whether or not they are constitutional 合宪的. Now that is called judicial review 司法审查, and it doesn't really say that in the Constitution -- that comes a little bit later in Marbury v. Madison 马伯里诉麦迪逊案 -- but there it is. +

Okay, now Article 4 talks about the federal government's relationship to the states and the relationships among the states themselves. And then we come to Article 5, which indicates 表明 the process for amending the Constitution 修正宪法. It establishes a two-part process for the amendment -- there's proposal 提议 and then there's ratification 批准. An amendment can be proposed in two ways: either two-thirds of both houses of Congress can propose it, or two-thirds of state legislatures 州立法机构. And then in order to ratify the amendment into law, three-fourths of the states have to agree. Now three-fourths or 75 percent is a very high number, which is why out of the hundreds of amendments proposed, we only have 27. But remember that under the Articles of Confederation, any amendment to the document required unanimous consent 一致同意 of all the states. So Article 5 made that process more achievable 可实现的. +

Okay, then in Article 6, there's another bombshell 重磅消息 you need to know about, and it's called the supremacy clause 至上条款. And it goes a little something like this: "This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof 据此；依照；依据; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land 最高法律." In other words, if the federal government makes a law and a state government makes a contradictory law 相矛盾的法律, the federal law will always trump 凌驾于；胜过 state law. Federal law is supreme 至高无上的. +

And again, this got the Anti-Federalists -- who opposed the Constitution -- all kinds of twitchy 紧张不安的, because if you combine the supremacy clause and the necessary and proper clause, what couldn't the federal government do? And furthermore 此外, if national law always trumps state law, then doesn't that make all state laws null and void 无效的? Anyway, that was the argument, and I have other videos that explain the outcome of that argument. +

So what we have seen is that the Constitution put way more power into the federal government than the Articles of Confederation did. And in doing so, it established a republican-style government in which power was divided between three branches which were capable of checking each other's power 相互制衡. But even with those checks and balances 制衡机制 in place, it didn't quell 平息 the fears of those who opposed the document. What ultimately got them to sign off on it 同意；批准 was the guarantee of a Bill of Rights 权利法案, which would outline 概述 specific individual liberties 个人自由 upon which the federal government could not trample 践踏. And they got what they asked for. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的下一个基础文献，即《美国宪法》（United States Constitution）。所以，如果你准备好以共和制的方式激发自己的思维，那么我们就开始吧。 +

好的，首先让我们回顾一下这份文献撰写时的历史背景。在《宪法》撰写之前，美国的治理文件是《邦联条例》（Articles of Confederation）。如果你想看一个解释这份文件的视频，就在这里。不管怎样，关于那个政府体系你需要记住的是，大部分权力由各州掌握，而中央政府 —— 它仅由立法分支组成 —— 极其软弱。 +

然后，由于《邦联条例》下的一系列困难，包括国会破产以及像谢斯起义（Shays' Rebellion）这样的事件，代表们于1787年聚集在费城（Philadelphia）起草一份新的治理文件。这就是我们《宪法》的由来。关于《宪法》的核心理念是，它建立了一个共和制政府，这与《邦联条例》所建立的邦联不同。 +

共和制政府是一种代表们代表人民做事的政府 —— 以防你不知道。从结构上看，《宪法》以序言（Preamble）开头，接着是七条条款。在这里你可以看到每一条款的总体主题。我们不会详细研究每一条款，但我特别想强调这份文件是如何解决《邦联条例》的问题的。基本上，它解决这些问题的方式是赋予中央政府比《邦联条例》下多得多的权力。 +

那让我们看看他们是怎么做的。第一条（Article 1）涉及国会的形式和权力 —— 也就是联邦政府的立法分支。我要补充的是，第一条是《宪法》中最长的部分，这能说明一些问题。它说明对于这个新的政府形式来说，代表人民的分支是最重要的。 +

好的，那么国会有什么权力呢？简单来说，是立法或制定法律的权力。你可以在第一条中直接看到：“本宪法所授予的所有立法权，均属于由参议院（Senate）和众议院（House of Representatives）组成的合众国国会。” 所以一开始，你就能看到《邦联条例》和《宪法》之间的一个主要区别。根据《宪法》，国会将组成一个两院制立法机构，这意味着会有两个议院。在参议院中，每个州有两名参议员，代表权平等；而在众议院中，代表权是按人口分配的。 +

第一条中你需要知道的最重要的部分是第八节（Section 8），其中明确列出了国会的列举权力。这里说国会有权征税、借款、铸造货币、宣战、招募和维持军队、维持海军。还有很多其他权力，但你能明白这个意思。 +

但这一部分最重要的部分可能在结尾，也就是所谓的 “必要且适当条款”（necessary and proper clause） —— 你也可能听到它被称为 “弹性条款”，意思是一样的。它说国会有权 “制定一切必要且适当的法律，以执行上述权力，以及本宪法授予合众国政府或其任何部门或官员的所有其他权力”。 +

我再怎么强调这句话的影响力都不为过，尤其是对于那些喜欢《邦联条例》下政府的人来说。这句话的意思是，好的，这些是联邦国会的所有权力，我们明确列举出来，这样国会就不会认为它可以随心所欲地制定任何法律。但接着 “必要且适当条款” 又说，如果国会需要制定与所有这些权力相关的任何其他必要且适当的法律，它就有权力这么做。 +

如果你觉得这听起来很模糊，确实是这样。正是这种模糊性让那些反对赋予联邦政府更多权力的人非常不满。他们担心 “必要且适当条款” 会让国会有自由去通过任何他们想要的法律，即使这些法律没有在第八节中明确列出。 +

好的，现在我们先把这个放一放，来看第二条（Article 2），它概述了行政分支（executive branch），也就是总统的相关规定。首先它谈到了选举总统的方式，是通过选举人团（Electoral College）。然后它接着列出了总统的明确权力。总统的第一项权力在第二节中是这样的：“总统应是合众国陆军、海军以及各州民兵的总司令。” 所以总统不能宣战 —— 宣战权属于国会 —— 但总统是军队指挥系统中的最高长官。 +

好的，然后在第三节中说 “总统应注意使法律得到忠实执行”。所以国会通过法律，而总统负责执行或实施这些法律。此外，总统是立法过程的最后一步。就像一旦一项法案在国会两院通过，总统必须签署它才能使其成为法律。 +

好的，然后第三条（Article 3）涉及司法分支（judicial branch），它说 “合众国的司法权，属于一个最高法院（Supreme Court），以及国会随时规定和设立的下级法院”。所以《宪法》规定设立一个联邦最高法院，然后赋予国会设立其他法院的权力，国会在1789年的《司法法》（Judiciary Act of 1789）中行使了这一权力。 +

关于最高法院（Supreme Court）的运作方式，重要的是要知道它被授予的管辖权（jurisdiction）类型。管辖权指的是哪些类型的争端在法院的权力范围内进行裁决。第三条规定法院有两种管辖权。第一：“在一切涉及大使、其他公使和领事以及一州为一方当事人的案件中，最高法院有初审管辖权。” 所以在这些案件中，最高法院有初审管辖权，这意味着最高法院可以首次审理该案件。然而：“在上述所有其他案件中，最高法院有上诉管辖权。” 上诉管辖权意味着法院不能首次审理案件，只能审理来自下级法院的上诉。最高法院审理的大多数案件都是来自下级法院的上诉。 +

我们已经说过立法分支制定法律，然后行政分支 —— 也就是总统 —— 执行法律，接着司法分支解释法律以及判断法律是否符合宪法。这被称为司法审查（judicial review），《宪法》中并没有明确说明这一点 —— 这是在 “马伯里诉麦迪逊案”（Marbury v. Madison）中出现的，但这就是司法审查的内容。 +

好的，现在第四条（Article 4）谈到了联邦政府与各州的关系以及各州之间的关系。然后我们来看第五条（Article 5），它指出了修正《宪法》的程序。它确立了一个分为两部分的修正案程序 —— 提出修正案和批准修正案。修正案可以通过两种方式提出：要么国会两院三分之二的议员提议，要么三分之二的州立法机构提议。然后为了使修正案成为法律，必须得到四分之三的州的同意。四分之三，也就是75%，是一个非常高的比例，这就是为什么在提出的数百项修正案中，我们只有27项修正案获得通过。但要记住，在《邦联条例》下，对文件的任何修正案都需要所有州的一致同意。所以第五条使这个程序更具可行性。 +

好的，然后在第六条（Article 6）中，还有另一个你需要知道的重要内容，那就是 “最高权力条款”（supremacy clause）。它是这样说的：“本宪法，以及依本宪法所制定的合众国法律；以及在合众国权力下所缔结或将缔结的一切条约，均为全国的最高法律。” 换句话说，如果联邦政府制定了一项法律，而州政府制定了一项与之矛盾的法律，联邦法律总是会凌驾于州法律之上。联邦法律是至高无上的。 +

同样，这让反对《宪法》的反联邦党人（Anti-Federalists）非常不安，因为如果你把 “最高权力条款” 和 “必要且适当条款” 结合起来，联邦政府还有什么不能做的呢？而且，如果国家法律总是凌驾于州法律之上，那不就意味着所有州法律都无效了吗？不管怎样，这就是他们的论点，我还有其他视频解释了这个论点的结果。 +

所以我们看到，《宪法》赋予联邦政府的权力比《邦联条例》赋予的权力多得多。通过这样做，它建立了一个共和制政府，在这个政府中，权力被分配给三个相互制衡的分支。但即使有这些制衡机制，也无法消除那些反对这份文件的人的担忧。最终让他们签署这份文件的是《权利法案》（Bill of Rights）的保证，《权利法案》概述了联邦政府不能侵犯的具体个人自由。他们得到了他们所要求的。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的关于《美国宪法》的内容。点击这里查看更多关于美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程基础文献的视频。如果你想在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分，那么点击这里获取我的复习资料包。一如既往，如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那就通过订阅告诉我。海姆勒，退出。 +

Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at the next foundational document for AP Government, namely the United States Constitution. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked republican style, well then let's get to it.

Now we're not going to consider every article in detail, but I especially want to emphasize how this document solves the problems of the Articles of Confederation.

And the most important section in Article 1 that you need to know is Section 8, in which the enumerated powers of Congress are explicitly outlined. Here it says that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes, to borrow money, to coin money, to declare war, to raise and support armies, and maintain a navy. There's a lot more there, but you get the idea.

But probably the most important part of this section comes at the end, and it's known as the necessary and proper clause -- or you might hear it called the elastic clause -- same thing. It says that Congress has the power "to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof."
