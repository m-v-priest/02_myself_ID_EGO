Here's the transformed version with key vocabulary annotated:

Well hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History 历史. In this video, we're going to look in depth 深入地 at one of your foundational 基础的；基本的 documents 文件 for AP Government, namely the Articles of Confederation 联邦条例. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked 挤奶, let's get to it. +

Okay, first of all, what is the Articles of Confederation? So glad you asked. The Articles of Confederation was the first constitution 宪法 of the United States. And as I said in another video, historians argue about whether it should be called a constitution or a treaty 条约, but that's neither here nor there 无关紧要 for our purposes. Once the United States had declared independence 独立 from Britain, it was without a government, so the Articles solved that problem. +

Before we get into the main parts of it, it'll be important for you to know what the word confederation 联邦；同盟 means. Basically, it's a form of government in which several powers unite to form a central power. In the very first days of the United States, the 13 different states formed a confederacy 同盟；联邦. +

Now the main thing you need to know about the Articles of Confederation is that this governing 治理的 document placed most of the power in the hands of the states at the expense of 以...为代价 the federal government. You can see that right away right in the opening paragraph. What do we see? A list of the states: "Articles of Confederation and perpetual 永久的 Union between the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations 种植园, Connecticut," etc., etc. And then just in case you were confused about where the power lay, the article opens in Article 2 with this little gem 珍宝；精华 -- and as a side note 顺便说一句, this is the most important sentence in the whole document: "Each state retains 保留 its sovereignty 主权, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction 管辖权, and right, which is not by this confederation expressly 明确地 delegated 授权 to the United States, in Congress assembled 集合." +

In other words, they're saying don't get confused -- the states are supreme 至高无上的 here, and unless we explicitly 明确地 delegate any power to the federal Congress, all of that power remains in the states. +

Now once we get to Article 5, we begin to see the provisions 规定 for the federal government. First of all, the Articles established a single branch 分支；部门 of the federal government, namely a legislative 立法的 branch -- no president, no federal court. And how is that federal Congress going to operate? Well, further along in Article 5 it says: "In determining questions in the United States in Congress assembled, each state shall have one vote." In other words, representation 代表 in Congress is equal among the states. A small state like New Hampshire has exactly the same amount of power as a gigantic 巨大的 state like Virginia. +

Now if the early Americans were so concerned with granting 授予 the central government too much power, why did they even form one at all? Well, it's because they needed a centralized 中央集权的 government in order to do business with other nations. And we could see that in Article 6: "No state, without the consent 同意 of the United States in Congress assembled, shall send any embassy 大使馆 to, or receive any embassy from, or enter into any conference 会议, agreement 协议, alliance 联盟 or treaty with any king, prince or state." +

Article 6 then goes on to further restrict 限制 the power of the central government by establishing that it cannot raise a national army. So where is the army or navy going to come from when it's needed? Think about it -- on the nose 完全正确 -- the states: "But every state shall always keep up a well-regulated 管理良好的 and disciplined 纪律严明的 militia 民兵, sufficiently armed 武装 and accounted 说明, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces 野战炮 and tents 帐篷, and a proper quantity of arms 武器, ammunition 弹药 and camp equipage 装备." +

Then in Article 9, it goes on to explain the powers that Congress actually does have, which really isn't that much. The Congress will be the final arbiter 仲裁者 in disputes 争端 between states, and fixing standard weights 重量 and measures 测量, and appointing 任命 committees to do its work, etc., etc. Then at the end of Article 9, it basically says that Congress can't do the major things it needs to do like declare war unless nine states assent 同意 to the same. Now 9 out of 13 would be considered a supermajority 绝对多数, and that is as hard to muster 召集 as it sounds. So basically from this, you just need to understand that the power of Congress was severely 严重地 limited by this provision 规定. +

But the Articles of Confederation was even further limited by the impossibility of changing it or amending 修正 it. In Article 13, it says: "Nor shall any alteration 改变 at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed 确认 by the legislatures 立法机关 of every state." Okay, wait -- it actually says that if the Articles are to be amended, it requires the agreement of every state -- 13 out of 13, the whole shebang 全部, all of them. And if a supermajority is hard to achieve, how easy do you think unanimity 全体一致 would be? +

Anyway, the point is there are a few things that the Articles achieved. First, it established a central government where there was none before. Secondly, it did successfully avoid a tyrannical 专制的 central government by giving it no power. But the flaws 缺陷 in this system were legion 众多, and that's why in 1787, delegates 代表 met at the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议 and ultimately 最终 drafted 起草 a new Constitution. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将深入研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的基础文献之一，即《邦联条例》（Articles of Confederation）。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

好的，首先，《邦联条例》是什么呢？很高兴你问这个问题。《邦联条例》是美国的第一部宪法。就像我在另一个视频中说的，历史学家们对于它究竟该被称为宪法还是条约存在争议，但这对我们的研究目的来说无关紧要。一旦美国宣布脱离英国独立，它就没有政府了，而《邦联条例》解决了这个问题。 +

在我们深入了解它的主要内容之前，了解 “邦联”（confederation）这个词的含义很重要。基本上，它是一种政府形式，在这种形式下，几个权力机构联合起来形成一个中央权力机构。在美国建国初期，13个不同的州组成了一个邦联。 +

现在，关于《邦联条例》你需要知道的主要一点是，这份治理文件把大部分权力交到了各州手中，而牺牲了联邦政府的权力。你从开篇段落就能立刻看到这一点。我们看到了什么呢？一系列州的名单：“新罕布什尔州（New Hampshire）、马萨诸塞湾（Massachusetts Bay）、罗得岛和普罗维登斯种植园（Rhode Island and Providence Plantations）、康涅狄格州（Connecticut）等州之间的《邦联条例》和永久联盟” 等等。然后，万一你对权力的归属感到困惑，条例的第二条开头有这样一句关键内容 —— 顺便说一下，这是整个文件中最重要的一句话：“每个州保留其主权、自由和独立，以及除了明确通过本邦联授予合众国会的权力之外的每一项权力、管辖权和权利。” +

换句话说，他们是在说别搞混了 —— 各州在这里是至高无上的，除非我们明确把权力授予联邦国会，否则所有权力都归各州所有。 +

现在，当我们看到第五条时，我们开始了解联邦政府的相关规定。首先，《邦联条例》建立了联邦政府的一个单一分支，即立法分支 —— 没有总统，也没有联邦法院。那么联邦国会将如何运作呢？嗯，第五条后面接着说：“在合众国会对问题进行裁决时，每个州有一票表决权。” 换句话说，在国会中各州的代表权是平等的。像新罕布什尔州这样的小州和像弗吉尼亚州（Virginia）这样的大州拥有完全相同的权力。 +

现在，如果早期的美国人如此担心赋予中央政府太多权力，那他们为什么还要组建一个中央政府呢？嗯，这是因为他们需要一个中央政府来与其他国家进行事务往来。我们可以在第六条中看到这一点：“未经合众国会同意，任何州不得派遣任何使团前往、接受任何使团，或与任何国王、君主或国家签订任何会议、协议、联盟或条约。” +

第六条接着进一步限制中央政府的权力，规定它不能组建国家军队。那么当需要军队或海军时，它们从哪里来呢？仔细想想 —— 没错 —— 来自各州：“但每个州应始终维持一支管理良好、纪律严明的民兵，配备充足的武器并做好记录，并且应提供并随时准备在公共仓库中储备适当数量的野战炮、帐篷，以及适量的武器、弹药和营地装备。” +

然后在第九条中，它接着解释了国会实际拥有的权力，而这些权力其实并不多。国会将成为各州之间争端的最终仲裁者，还包括确定标准度量衡，以及任命委员会来开展工作等等。然后在第九条的末尾，基本上是说除非有九个州同意，否则国会不能做一些重要的事情，比如宣战。13个州中要有9个州同意就被认为是多数同意，而这听起来就很难做到。所以基本上从这一点你需要明白，国会的权力受到了这条规定的严重限制。 +

但《邦联条例》还因为难以对其进行修改而受到进一步限制。在第十三条中，它说：“此后对条例的任何修改，除非在合众国会达成一致，然后由每个州的立法机构确认，否则不得进行。” 好的，等等 —— 实际上它说的是如果要修改《邦联条例》，需要每个州的同意 —— 13个州全部同意，所有的州都同意。如果多数同意都很难实现，那你觉得全体一致同意会有多容易呢？ +

不管怎样，重点是《邦联条例》还是取得了一些成果。首先，它建立了一个之前不存在的中央政府。其次，它通过不赋予中央政府权力成功地避免了一个专制的中央政府。但这个体系存在诸多缺陷，这就是为什么在1787年，代表们在制宪会议（Constitutional Convention）上会面，并最终起草了一部新宪法。 +
