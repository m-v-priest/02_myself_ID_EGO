Well hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. And furthermore 而且；此外, welcome to the first video review for Unit Three of the AP Government curriculum 课程；课程安排. This unit is all about civil liberties 公民自由；依法享有的自由权利 and civil rights 公民权利；公民的法定权利, and this video in particular 特别；尤其 is an introduction 介绍；引言 to the Bill of Rights 《权利法案》. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked (俚语幽默：准备好动脑了), then let's get to it 开始做；着手处理.
+

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain 解释；说明 how the US Constitution 宪法 protects individual 个人的；单独的 liberties 自由权利 and rights 权利, and describe 描述；叙述 the rights protected in the Bill of Rights 《权利法案》. Okay, so we've got plenty 大量；许多 to do, but let me remind you before we jump in 开始；投入 that if you need help getting an A in your class and a five on your exam 考试 in May, then you can grab 获取；拿起 my AP Government review packet 资料包；小册子. It's got exclusive 专有的；独家的 videos that are not here on YouTube, and practice questions 练习题, and AP style practice exams 模拟考试, and basically 基本上；从根本上 everything your little heart could possibly 可能地；也许地 desire 渴望；期望 to succeed 成功；达成目标 in your class and do well on the exam.
+

Okay, so the Bill of Rights 《权利法案》 — what is it and where did it come from 来源；起源? Well, the Bill of Rights includes the first 10 amendments 宪法修正案 to the Constitution 宪法, designed 被设计为；旨在 to protect civil liberties 公民自由. And what are civil liberties 公民自由? Civil liberties are constitutionally 宪法地；根据宪法 established 确立的 guarantees 保证；保障 and freedoms 自由 that protect citizens 公民 against arbitrary 专横的；随意的 government interference 干涉；干预. In other words 换句话说, the Bill of Rights exists to keep Big Daddy Government (俚语，戏称强大的中央政府) from getting all up in your business (俚语：过度干涉你的私人事务).
+

Now where did the Bill of Rights 《权利法案》 come from? Well, as you no doubt 无疑；肯定 remember, there was a great fight over the ratification 正式批准；认可 of the Constitution 宪法, and the warring 敌对的；交战的 factions 派别；集团 were known as the Federalists 联邦党人 — who were in favor of 支持；赞成 a more powerful central government 中央政府 — and the Anti-Federalists 反联邦党人 — who were in favor of more powerful states. And since the Constitution 宪法 very much invested 赋予；授予 the federal government 联邦政府 with more power than it had under the Articles of Confederation 《邦联条例》, the Anti-Federalists got a little twitchy 焦躁不安的；紧张的 about the possibility of that government becoming tyrannical 专制的；暴政的 and squashing 压制；镇压 their freedoms 自由.
+

So the Anti-Federalists 反联邦党人 said they would not sign or ratify 正式批准 the Constitution 宪法 without a Bill of Rights 《权利法案》 that outlined 概述；列出 the specific 明确的；具体的 liberties 自由 upon which the federal government 联邦政府 could not tread 踩踏；侵犯. Now probably the most important of these Anti-Federalists for you to know is George Mason. He was a delegate 代表 from Virginia at the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议 and was not shy about frequently 经常地 opening his mouth hole (俚语幽默：开口说话) and protesting 抗议；反对 the Constitution's lack of 缺乏；没有 a Bill of Rights.
+

Now James Madison, who wrote the Constitution 宪法, argued 辩称；争论 along with his fellow Federalists 联邦党人 that no Bill of Rights 《权利法案》 was necessary 必要的；不可或缺的 because a free government by the people had no right 权利；权限 to trample 践踏；侵犯 on civil liberties 公民自由 anyway, so what's the point 意义；目的 in spelling all of them out 详细列出；清楚说明? Plus 此外；再者, Madison said if we start listing 列出 out specific protected rights 受保护的权利, it's very likely 很可能 that something is going to be left off 遗漏 that list, and thus 因此；于是 better not to specifically mention 提及 anything. But Mason and the Anti-Federalists were like "nuh-uh" (俚语：才不是呢) and demanded 要求；强烈请求 that a Bill of Rights be included if there was any hope of their states ratifying 正式批准 the Constitution 宪法.
+

And so Madison compromised 妥协；折中 and finally 最终地 agreed to include 包含 a Bill of Rights 《权利法案》 as soon as the requisite 必需的；必要的 number of states ratified 正式批准 the document 文件；文献. And that day came in September of 1787 when the delegates 代表 at the Constitutional Convention 制宪会议 signed off on 签署；正式批准 the document, and then in the next year when the Constitution 宪法 was finally ratified. So Madison got to work 开始工作 on the first 10 amendments 宪法修正案 to the Constitution, and he drew heavily 深受影响地 from George Mason's own work in the Virginia Declaration of Rights 《弗吉尼亚权利宣言》 included in the state of Virginia's Constitution, which in turn 又；反过来 borrowed 借鉴 from the English Bill of Rights 《英国权利法案》 in the Magna Carta 《大宪章》.
+

Now Madison wrote more than 10 amendments 宪法修正案, but only 10 of them were ratified 正式批准. And since I'm devoting 奉献；致力于 whole videos to the content 内容 of these amendments, here I'm only going to give you a taste 一小部分；简单介绍. Look, I'm not just listing these out for funsies (俚语幽默：不是为了好玩) — you do have to have a working knowledge 实用知识；基本了解 of these amendments 宪法修正案, and that's what this whole unit 单元；章节 is about. So let's have a look 看一下；浏览.
+

The First Amendment 第一修正案 protects 保护 the freedom 自由 of religion 宗教, speech 言论, press 新闻出版, assembly 集会, and petition 请愿. The Second Amendment 第二修正案 protects the right 权利 to keep and bear arms 携带武器. The Third Amendment 第三修正案 protects citizens 公民 from having soldiers 士兵 quartered 驻扎；安置 in their homes 家中. The Fourth Amendment 第四修正案 protects against unreasonable 不合理的 searches 搜查 and seizures 扣押；没收 of personal 个人的 property 财产 and effects 动产；随身物品. The Fifth Amendment 第五修正案 deals with 处理 the rights of citizens 公民 when they are accused 被控告 of crimes 罪行. In the same vein 同样地；类似地, the Sixth Amendment 第六修正案 explains 说明 how the process 程序；流程 will go when a person is accused of a crime and explains the protections 保护；保障 to which they are entitled 有权享有的. The Seventh Amendment 第七修正案 guarantees 保证；确保 the right to trial 审判；审讯 by jury 陪审团. The Eighth Amendment 第八修正案 protects against cruel 残酷的 and unusual 不寻常的 punishment 惩罚 and excessive 过高的 bail 保释金. The Ninth Amendment 第九修正案 acknowledges 承认；认可 that if there are other rights not mentioned 提及 in the first 10 amendments, their exclusion 排除；遗漏 from the list does not mean that such rights are not protected. And the Tenth Amendment 第十修正案 says that any power not explicitly 明确地；清楚地 granted 授予 by the Constitution 宪法 to the federal government 联邦政府 belongs exclusively 唯一地；专属地 to the states.
+

Okay, so that's the content 内容 of the Bill of Rights 《权利法案》, and there's one more very important thing I need to mention 提到 regarding 关于；有关 these amendments 宪法修正案. The liberties 自由 listed in the Bill of Rights protect citizens 公民 from intrusion 干涉；侵犯 by the federal government 联邦政府. And that was the point 意义；目的 of including these amendments — the Anti-Federalists were afraid 害怕；担忧 of intrusion by the federal government, and that's precisely 恰恰；准确地 what these 10 amendments protected them from. So that means in the early days of the Republic 共和国, all the liberties listed in the Bill of Rights protected citizens from the federal government, not state governments 州政府. Now later, with the passage 通过 of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案, the Bill of Rights will be applied to the states, but that's not how it originally 起初；最初 was.

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。此外，欢迎来到美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程第三单元的第一个视频复习。这个单元全部是关于公民自由和公民权利的，而这个视频具体来说是对《权利法案》（Bill of Rights）的一个介绍。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释美国宪法如何保护个人自由和权利，并描述《权利法案》所保护的权利。好的，我们有很多内容要讲，但在我们开始之前，我要提醒你，如果你想在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分，那么你可以获取我的美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程复习资料包。它包含了一些在YouTube上没有的独家视频、练习题，还有美国大学预修课程（AP）风格的模拟考试，基本上包含了你在课堂上取得成功以及在考试中取得好成绩所渴望的一切。所以，如果你对此感兴趣，那就伸出你的手指点击链接，查看描述中的内容。 +

好的，那么《权利法案》是什么，它从何而来呢？嗯，《权利法案》包括宪法的前十条修正案，旨在保护公民自由。那么公民自由是什么呢？公民自由是由宪法确立的保障和自由，用来保护公民免受政府的任意干涉。换句话说，《权利法案》的存在是为了防止 “大政府” 干涉你的事务。 +

那么《权利法案》从何而来呢？嗯，毫无疑问，你还记得，在宪法的批准问题上有过一场激烈的争论，对立的派别分别是联邦党人（Federalists）—— 他们支持一个更强大的中央政府，以及反联邦党人（Anti-Federalists）—— 他们支持各州拥有更大的权力。由于宪法赋予联邦政府（中央政府）的权力比《邦联条例》下的权力要大得多，反联邦党人对政府可能变得专制并压制他们的自由感到有些不安。 +

所以反联邦党人表示，如果没有一个列出联邦政府不得侵犯的具体自由的《权利法案》，他们就不会签署或批准宪法。在这些反联邦党人中，你需要了解的最重要的人物可能是乔治·梅森（George Mason）。他是制宪会议（Constitutional Convention）上来自弗吉尼亚州（Virginia）的代表，并且毫不避讳地经常开口抗议宪法缺少《权利法案》。 +

现在，撰写宪法的詹姆斯·麦迪逊（James Madison）和他的联邦党同仁们认为，不需要《权利法案》，因为一个由人民组成的自由政府无论如何都无权践踏公民自由，所以把所有自由都列出来有什么意义呢？此外，麦迪逊说，如果我们开始列出具体的受保护权利，很可能会有一些权利被遗漏，所以最好不要具体提及任何权利。但梅森和反联邦党人表示反对，并要求如果希望他们所在的州批准宪法，就必须包含一个《权利法案》。 +

所以麦迪逊做出了妥协，最终同意一旦有足够数量的州批准这份文件，就加入一个《权利法案》。那一天在1787年9月到来，当时制宪会议的代表们签署了这份文件，然后在次年，宪法最终获得批准。所以麦迪逊开始着手制定宪法的前十条修正案，并且大量借鉴了乔治·梅森在弗吉尼亚州宪法中《弗吉尼亚权利宣言》里的内容，而《弗吉尼亚权利宣言》又借鉴了《大宪章》（Magna Carta）中的《英国权利法案》。 +

现在，麦迪逊撰写的修正案不止十条，但只有十条获得了批准。由于我会用完整的视频来讲解这些修正案的内容，在这里我只给你一个大概的了解。听着，我列出这些可不是为了好玩 —— 你确实需要掌握这些修正案的相关知识，而这正是整个单元的内容。所以我们来看看。 +

第一修正案保护宗教、言论、新闻、集会和请愿的自由。第二修正案保护持有和携带武器的权利。第三修正案保护公民不被要求让士兵在他们家中驻扎。第四修正案保护公民的个人财产和物品不被无理搜查和扣押。第五修正案涉及公民在被指控犯罪时的权利。同样地，第六修正案解释了一个人被指控犯罪时的程序，并说明了他们应享有的保护。第七修正案保障由陪审团审判的权利。第八修正案保护公民免受残酷和不寻常的惩罚以及过高的保释金。第九修正案承认，如果有一些权利没有在前十条修正案中提及，将其排除在外并不意味着这些权利不受保护。第十修正案规定，任何没有被宪法明确授予联邦政府的权力都归各州独有。 +

好的，这就是《权利法案》的内容，关于这些修正案，我还需要提到一件非常重要的事情。《权利法案》中列出的自由保护公民免受联邦政府的干涉。这就是加入这些修正案的意义所在 —— 反联邦党人害怕联邦政府的干涉，而这十条修正案正是保护他们免受这种干涉的。所以这意味着在美国建国初期，《权利法案》中列出的所有自由是保护公民免受联邦政府的干涉，而不是州政府的干涉。后来，随着第十四修正案的通过，《权利法案》才被应用到各州，但最初并非如此。 +

Well hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. And furthermore, welcome to the first video review for Unit Three of the AP Government curriculum. This unit is all about civil liberties and civil rights, and this video in particular is an introduction to the Bill of Rights. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it.

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how the US Constitution protects individual liberties and rights, and describe the rights protected in the Bill of Rights. Okay, so we've got plenty to do, but let me remind you before we jump in that if you need help getting an A in your class and a five on your exam in May, then you can grab my AP Government review packet. It's got exclusive videos that are not here on YouTube, and practice questions, and AP style practice exams, and basically everything your little heart could possibly desire to succeed in your class and do well on the exam. So if that's something you're into, then get your clicky finger out and follow the link in the description.

Okay, so the Bill of Rights -- what is it and where did it come from? Well, the Bill of Rights includes the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, designed to protect civil liberties. And what are civil liberties? Civil liberties are constitutionally established guarantees and freedoms that protect citizens against arbitrary government interference. In other words, the Bill of Rights exists to keep Big Daddy Government from getting all up in your business.

Now where did the Bill of Rights come from? Well, as you no doubt remember, there was a great fight over the ratification of the Constitution, and the warring factions were known as the Federalists -- who were in favor of a more powerful central government -- and the Anti-Federalists -- who were in favor of more powerful states. And since the Constitution very much invested the federal government (the central government) with more power than it had under the Articles of Confederation, the Anti-Federalists got a little twitchy about the possibility of that government becoming tyrannical and squashing their freedoms.

So the Anti-Federalists said they would not sign or ratify the Constitution without a Bill of Rights that outlined the specific liberties upon which the federal government could not tread. Now probably the most important of these Anti-Federalists for you to know is George Mason. He was a delegate from Virginia at the Constitutional Convention and was not shy about frequently opening his mouth hole and protesting the Constitution's lack of a Bill of Rights.

Now James Madison, who wrote the Constitution, argued along with his fellow Federalists that no Bill of Rights was necessary because a free government by the people had no right to trample on civil liberties anyway, so what's the point in spelling all of them out? Plus, Madison said if we start listing out specific protected rights, it's very likely that something is going to be left off that list, and thus better not to specifically mention anything. But Mason and the Anti-Federalists were like "nuh-uh" and demanded that a Bill of Rights be included if there was any hope of their states ratifying the Constitution.

And so Madison compromised and finally agreed to include a Bill of Rights as soon as the requisite number of states ratified the document. And that day came in September of 1787 when the delegates at the Constitutional Convention signed off on the document, and then in the next year when the Constitution was finally ratified. So Madison got to work on the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, and he drew heavily from George Mason's own work in the Virginia Declaration of Rights included in the state of Virginia's Constitution, which in turn borrowed from the English Bill of Rights in the Magna Carta.

Now Madison wrote more than 10 amendments, but only 10 of them were ratified. And since I'm devoting whole videos to the content of these amendments, here I'm only going to give you a taste. Look, I'm not just listing these out for funsies -- you do have to have a working knowledge of these amendments, and that's what this whole unit is about. So let's have a look.

The First Amendment protects the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition. The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms. The Third Amendment protects citizens from having soldiers quartered in their homes. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures of personal property and effects. The Fifth Amendment deals with the rights of citizens when they are accused of crimes. In the same vein, the Sixth Amendment explains how the process will go when a person is accused of a crime and explains the protections to which they are entitled. The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to trial by jury. The Eighth Amendment protects against cruel and unusual punishment and excessive bail. The Ninth Amendment acknowledges that if there are other rights not mentioned in the first 10 amendments, their exclusion from the list does not mean that such rights are not protected. And the Tenth Amendment says that any power not explicitly granted by the Constitution to the federal government belongs exclusively to the states.

Okay, so that's the content of the Bill of Rights, and there's one more very important thing I need to mention regarding these amendments. The liberties outlined in the Bill of Rights protect citizens from intrusion by the federal government. And that was the point of including these amendments -- the Anti-Federalists were afraid of intrusion by the federal government, and that's precisely what these 10 amendments protected them from. So that means in the early days of the Republic, all the liberties listed in the Bill of Rights protected citizens from the federal government, not state governments. Now later, with the passage of the 14th Amendment, the Bill of Rights will be applied to the states, but that's not how it originally was.
