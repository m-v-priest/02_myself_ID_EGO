Hey there and welcome back to Heimlich's History. Now we've been going through unit 2 of the AP government curriculum 课程, and in this video we're going to continue talking about the supreme court 最高法院, namely 即；也就是 how unpopular or controversial 有争议的 decisions have led people to question the legitimacy 合法性 of the court. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

So what we're trying to do in this video is the same thing we started in the last video: explain how the exercise 行使 of judicial review 司法审查 in conjunction with 与…一起 life tenure 终身任期 can lead to the debate about the legitimacy of the supreme court's power. Then we're also going to aim to 旨在 answer this: explain how other branches of government can limit the supreme court's power. +

So in order to get into this, you need to understand two terms that describe the kind of decisions that the court hands down 宣布. The first is judicial activism 司法能动主义. If a court is an activist court, that means it acts to establish policy 制定政策 and in its deliberative 慎重的；深思熟虑的 work considers the broad effects of a decision on society. Now to call a court activist is usually not a compliment 赞扬 but rather a complaint 抱怨 -- it's like saying that the court is going beyond the constitution 宪法 to establish the ideological will 意识形态意愿 of the majority. And that's not a conservative 保守派的 or a liberal 自由派的 thing -- justices 法官 of both ideologies have been accused of judicial activism, and I'll give you an example of both. +

The liberal Warren Court 沃伦法院 was accused of activism after the Brown v Board of Education 布朗诉教育委员会案 decision which led to the integration 融合；整合 of schools. This decision overturned 推翻 the precedent 先例 of legal racial segregation 法律上的种族隔离 and led many southern Americans to question the legitimacy of the supreme court. On the other hand, the conservative Roberts Court 罗伯茨法院 was accused of activism after the Citizens United vs FEC 联合公民诉联邦选举委员会案 decision, which dealt with 处理 campaign finance 竞选资金 and ultimately 最终 gave Republican candidates an edge 优势. +

Now the other term you need to know to describe the court is judicial restraint 司法克制主义. Justices who adhere to 坚持 this idea believe that judges are not appointed to make policy -- like that's the job of the legislature 立法机构 -- therefore a law should be struck down 废除 not in consideration of 考虑 its effects on society, but only to the degree that it violates 违反 the actual written word of the constitution. Those who fall into judicial restraint camp put a huge emphasis on 高度重视 precedent and the principle of stare decisis 遵循先例原则. It would be very hard to find a court devoted to judicial restraint that also made a habit of overturning precedent set by former courts. +

Now for all the virtues 优点 of judicial restraint and its emphasis on the letter of the law 法律条文, this conviction 信念 has also created the occasion for a violation of civil rights 侵犯公民权利, as in the "separate but equal" doctrine 学说 established by Plessy vs Ferguson 普莱西诉弗格森案. When justices operate under judicial restraint, it could sometimes keep them from overturning precedents that need to be overturned. +

Okay, now that we understand those two competing postures 立场 of the court, let's have a look at some of the court's most controversial decisions and consider how those decisions led people to question the court's legitimacy. First let's consider Dred Scott v Sanford 德雷德·斯科特诉桑福德案, which was decided under the Taney Court 坦尼法院 in 1857. If you've already taken US history, you may remember the Compromise of 1820 1820年密苏里妥协案, which established that slavery 奴隶制 could not exist in any territory 领土 above this line right here except in Missouri, and that compromise kept the slavery debate kind of in check 控制 for a while. +

Okay, so Dred Scott was an enslaved man who was taken to live in the Illinois and Wisconsin territories where slavery was not permitted 允许. Therefore, Scott sued for his freedom on the grounds that 基于…理由 his enslavement 奴役 was invalidated 使无效 by living in free territory. While the Taney Court decided that since enslaved people were not technically citizens, then Scott had no right to sue in federal court. And then furthermore, the court struck down the Compromise of 1820 as unconstitutional 违宪的 on the reasoning that 基于…理由 since enslaved people were considered property 财产, and the Fifth Amendment 第五修正案 protects a person's property, then any law that would deprive 剥夺 a person of his property was unconstitutional. And in striking down the Compromise of 1820, this decision effectively 实际上 opened the entire nation to slavery. +

And by the way, this would be a case of judicial activism because, as one of the dissenting justices 持异议的法官 pointed out, to say that Scott had no standing in court as a citizen had precisely 恰恰 no relationship to striking down the Compromise of 1820. So anyway, the outcome 结果 of this decision was massive, and I cannot emphasize to you how important it was in the first 70 or 80 years of American history to keep the slavery issue balanced so that no region had an advantage over the other. But this decision was a huge win for the slave states, and all of a sudden abolitionists 废奴主义者 were furious 愤怒的 because this group of unelected judges overturned a law that was keeping slavery confined to 局限于 the south. It wasn't just abolitionists -- like even northerners who cared nothing about the civil rights of enslaved black folks worried that the political and economic power of slave states would grow to consume them after this decision. So the legitimacy of the supreme court's power was certainly brought into question after that decision. +

Okay, another controversial decision was Korematsu v the United States 是松诉美国案 in 1944. Now if you know your dates, you know that that decision was handed down during World War II right after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor 珍珠港, effectively bringing the US into the war. President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which ordered Americans of Japanese descent 血统 to be gathered into internment camps 拘留营 on the reasoning that they might be involved in espionage 间谍活动 for the Japanese government. Now to be clear, the Japanese people we're talking about were American citizens -- many of them, not all of them, but many of them were American citizens. So by executive order, Roosevelt forcibly 强制地 removed American citizens from their homes and put them in internment camps. +

One of those citizens, named Fred Korematsu, stood up and said, "uh, last time I checked, American citizens have Fifth Amendment rights which protect us from being imprisoned without a trial." Well, the supreme court upheld 支持 the forced internment in a tragic example of judicial restraint. The court had ruled in the previous year on another similar case called Hirabayashi v the United States 平林诉美国案, and in that decision the court argued that the relocation 重新安置 of Japanese American citizens and Japanese immigrants was constitutional because "in time of war, residents having ethnic affiliations 种族关系 with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry." +

Okay, now Roe v Wade 罗诉韦德案 is another very controversial decision that, like the two I've already mentioned, led some Americans to question the legitimacy of the court's power. However, we're going to talk a lot more about that case in unit 3, so I'll leave it there for now. But the last thing we need to discuss is how the other branches of government can check 制约 the decisions of the supreme court. Now it's really obvious how the court checks the other branches -- like it strikes down laws passed by the legislative branch 立法部门 or rules on the constitutionality 合宪性 of executive action 行政行为. But how in the world do the other branches check the court decisions? Well, I'll give you five ways. +

The first way the court can be checked by Congress is when legislators 立法者 pass laws that modify 修改 the impact of prior supreme court decisions. For example, in another video we talked about the decision United States v Lopez 美国诉洛佩兹案. The court struck down Congress's Gun-Free School Zones Act 无枪校园区法案 because they deemed 认为 it unconstitutional. And recall 回想 that the law prohibited 禁止 guns on school property based on the Commerce Clause 商业条款 of the constitution and Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce 州际贸易. On that basis, the court said it's a pretty big stretch 牵强附会, and they struck down the law. So in the same year, Congress amended 修订 that law to uphold 支持 the principle of keeping guns out of schools but made it clear how such a law related to the Commerce Clause. +

The second way Congress can check the court is through constitutional amendments 宪法修正案. So in response to 回应 the Dred Scott case, which essentially 本质上 opened all states to slavery, Congress passed the 13th Amendment 第十三修正案 which banned slavery. Also, there was a Civil War, but you know, whatever. The 13th Amendment reversed 推翻 the Dred Scott decision. +

The third way Congress can check the court is by passing legislation that impacts the court's jurisdiction 管辖权. Now remember what I said in another video about the court's jurisdiction, which is to say the scope 范围 of its power to hear cases 审理案件. The supreme court has both original and appellate jurisdiction 初审和上诉管辖权. Congress can't touch the court's original jurisdiction, but it can alter 改变 its appellate jurisdiction by restricting 限制 the kinds of cases the court can hear. +

And there are also two ways that the president can check the court. And the first is through judicial appointments 司法任命. I've talked about this already in this video and in the previous two, so the short version is this: that if a court hands down an unfavorable decision, then the president can appoint justices that are likely to hand down different decisions when the occasion arises 出现时机. And the second way the president can check the judicial branch 司法部门 is by simply not enforcing 执行 the decision handed down. This is a little sketchy 不可靠的, but it has happened nonetheless 尽管如此. +

Probably the most famous occasion was when the court ruled that the removal of Cherokee Indians from Georgia was unconstitutional. President Andrew Jackson, who was very much in favor of 支持 removal, allegedly 据说 said, "John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it," and then he went ahead with the removal program anyway. Now as a history teacher, I do feel compelled to 感到不得不 add that the evidence that Jackson actually said those words is a little shaky 不可靠的, but still no one doubts that he could have said something very much like it. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第二单元，在这个视频中，我们将继续讨论最高法院，具体来说是不受欢迎或有争议的裁决是如何导致人们质疑法院的合法性的。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

在这个视频中，我们要做的和上一个视频开始时一样：解释司法审查的行使与终身任期制是如何引发关于最高法院权力合法性的争论的。然后我们还要回答这个问题：解释政府的其他部门是如何限制最高法院的权力的。 +

为了深入探讨这个问题，你需要理解两个用来描述法院裁决的术语。第一个是 “司法能动主义（judicial activism）”。如果一个法院是奉行司法能动主义的，那就意味着它采取行动来制定政策，并且在其审议工作中会考虑一项裁决对社会的广泛影响。现在，称一个法院奉行司法能动主义通常不是一种称赞，而是一种批评——这就像是说法院超越了宪法去确立多数人的意识形态意愿。这与保守派或自由派无关——两种意识形态的大法官都曾被指责奉行司法能动主义，我会给你举两个方面的例子。 +

自由派的沃伦法院（Warren Court）在 “布朗诉教育委员会案（Brown v Board of Education）” 做出裁决后被指责奉行司法能动主义，该裁决导致了学校的种族融合。这个裁决推翻了合法的种族隔离的先例，使得许多美国南方人质疑最高法院的合法性。另一方面，保守派的罗伯茨法院（Roberts Court）在 “联合公民组织诉联邦选举委员会案（Citizens United vs FEC）” 做出裁决后被指责奉行司法能动主义，这个案件涉及竞选资金问题，最终让共和党候选人获得了优势。 +

现在，你需要知道的另一个描述法院的术语是 “司法克制（judicial restraint）”。坚持这种理念的大法官认为，法官的任命不是为了制定政策——制定政策是立法机构的工作——因此，只有当一项法律违反了宪法的实际文字表述时，才应该被废除，而不是考虑其对社会的影响。那些属于司法克制阵营的人非常强调先例和遵循先例（stare decisis）的原则。很难找到一个既致力于司法克制又习惯推翻先前法院所确立先例的法院。 +

尽管司法克制有其优点，并且强调法律条文，但这种信念也导致了侵犯公民权利的情况，就像 “普莱西诉弗格森案（Plessy vs Ferguson）” 所确立的 “隔离但平等” 原则那样。当大法官们奉行司法克制时，有时会使他们无法推翻那些需要被推翻的先例。 +

好的，既然我们理解了法院的这两种相互对立的姿态，那我们来看看法院一些最具争议的裁决，并思考这些裁决是如何导致人们质疑法院的合法性的。首先让我们看看 “德雷德·斯科特诉桑福德案（Dred Scott v Sanford）”，这是1857年由坦尼法院（Taney Court）做出的裁决。如果你学过美国历史，你可能还记得1820年的妥协案，该妥协案规定除了密苏里州之外，在此线以上的任何地区都不能存在奴隶制，这个妥协案在一段时间内抑制了关于奴隶制的争论。 +

好的，德雷德·斯科特（Dred Scott）是一名奴隶，他被带到伊利诺伊州和威斯康星州的领土上生活，而这些地方是不允许奴隶制存在的。因此，斯科特以他身处自由领土而使他的奴隶身份无效为由，为自己的自由提起诉讼。坦尼法院裁定，由于奴隶在技术上不是公民，所以斯科特没有权利在联邦法院起诉。此外，法院以奴隶被视为财产，而第五修正案保护个人财产为由，判定1820年的妥协案违宪。通过推翻1820年的妥协案，这个裁决实际上使整个国家都向奴隶制敞开了大门。 +

顺便说一下，这是一个司法能动主义的案例，因为正如一位持异议的大法官所指出的，说斯科特作为公民没有诉讼资格与推翻1820年的妥协案毫无关系。不管怎样，这个裁决的结果影响巨大，我要强调的是，在美国历史的前七八十年里，保持奴隶制问题的平衡非常重要，这样没有哪个地区能占据优势。但这个裁决对蓄奴州来说是一个巨大的胜利，突然之间，废奴主义者们非常愤怒，因为这群未经选举产生的法官推翻了一项将奴隶制限制在南方的法律。不只是废奴主义者——甚至那些对被奴役黑人的公民权利毫不关心的北方人也担心，在这个裁决之后，蓄奴州的政治和经济权力会壮大到吞噬他们。所以，在这个裁决之后，最高法院权力的合法性无疑受到了质疑。 +

好的，另一个有争议的裁决是1944年的 “小林正雄诉美国案（Korematsu v the United States）”。如果你了解时间线，你就知道这个裁决是在二战期间，日本轰炸珍珠港后做出的，日本轰炸珍珠港实际上使美国卷入了战争。富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福（Franklin D. Roosevelt）总统发布了第9066号行政命令，该命令以日裔美国人可能为日本政府从事间谍活动为由，下令将他们聚集到拘留营。需要明确的是，这里所说的日本人是指美国公民——其中许多人（不是全部）是美国公民。所以，根据行政命令，罗斯福强行将美国公民从他们的家中带走，并把他们关进了拘留营。 +

其中一名叫弗雷德·小林（Fred Korematsu）的公民站出来说：“据我所知，美国公民拥有第五修正案所赋予的权利，这些权利保护我们不被未经审判就监禁。” 好吧，最高法院以一个悲剧性的司法克制的例子支持了这种强制拘留。最高法院在前一年对另一个类似的案件 “平林诉美国案（Hirabayashi v the United States）” 做出了裁决，在那个裁决中，最高法院认为，将日裔美国公民和日本移民重新安置是符合宪法的，因为 “在战争时期，与入侵的敌人有族裔关联的居民可能比其他血统的居民构成更大的危险来源”。 +

好的，“罗伊诉韦德案（Roe v Wade）” 是另一个非常有争议的裁决，和我已经提到的两个裁决一样，它导致一些美国人质疑最高法院权力的合法性。然而，我们将在第三单元中更多地讨论这个案件，所以我现在先说到这里。但我们最后需要讨论的是政府的其他部门是如何制衡最高法院的裁决的。现在很明显，最高法院是如何制衡其他部门的——比如它会推翻立法部门通过的法律，或者对行政行为的合宪性做出裁决。但其他部门到底是如何制衡最高法院的裁决的呢？好吧，我会告诉你五种方式。 +

国会制衡最高法院的第一种方式是，立法者通过修改先前最高法院裁决影响的法律。例如，在另一个视频中我们谈到了 “美国诉洛佩兹案（United States v Lopez）”。最高法院以违宪为由推翻了国会的《无枪校园区法案》。还记得这项法律是基于宪法的商业条款以及国会管理州际贸易的权力，禁止在学校财产上持有枪支。基于此，最高法院认为这有点牵强，于是推翻了这项法律。所以在同一年，国会修改了这项法律，以维护将枪支拒之校园门外的原则，但明确了这样一项法律与商业条款的关系。 +

国会制衡最高法院的第二种方式是通过宪法修正案。所以，为了回应基本上使所有州都向奴隶制敞开大门的 “德雷德·斯科特案”，国会通过了第十三修正案，该修正案禁止奴隶制。当然，随后发生了内战。第十三修正案推翻了 “德雷德·斯科特案” 的裁决。 +

国会制衡最高法院的第三种方式是通过通过影响法院管辖权的立法。还记得我在另一个视频中说过的法院的管辖权吧，也就是它审理案件的权力范围。最高法院拥有初审管辖权和上诉管辖权。国会不能触及最高法院的初审管辖权，但它可以通过限制法院能审理的案件种类来改变其上诉管辖权。 +

总统制衡最高法院也有两种方式。第一种是通过司法任命。我在这个视频和之前的两个视频中都谈到过这个问题，简单来说就是：如果最高法院做出了一个不利的裁决，那么总统可以任命那些在出现相关情况时可能会做出不同裁决的大法官。总统制衡司法部门的第二种方式是干脆不执行最高法院做出的裁决。这有点不太靠谱，但这种情况确实发生过。 +

最著名的例子可能是最高法院裁定将切罗基印第安人从佐治亚州驱逐是违宪的情况。非常支持驱逐行动的安德鲁·杰克逊（Andrew Jackson）总统据称说过：“约翰·马歇尔（John Marshall）做出了他的裁决，现在让他来执行吧。” 然后他还是继续推进了驱逐计划。作为一名历史老师，我觉得有必要补充一点，关于杰克逊实际说过这些话的证据有点站不住脚，但没有人怀疑他很可能说过类似的话。 +

hey there and welcome back to heimlich's history. now we've been going through unit 2 of the ap government curriculum, and in this video we're going to continue talking about the supreme court, namely how unpopular or controversial decisions have led people to question the legitimacy of the court. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it.

the liberal warren court was accused of activism after the brown v board of education decision which led to the integration of schools. this decision overturned the precedent of legal racial segregation and led many southern americans to question the legitimacy of the supreme court. on the other hand, the conservative roberts court was accused of activism after the citizens united vs fec decision, which dealt with campaign finance and ultimately gave republican candidates an edge.

okay, another controversial decision was korematsu v the united states in 1944. now if you know your dates, you know that that decision was handed down during world war ii right after the japanese bombed pearl harbor, effectively bringing the us into the war. president roosevelt issued executive order 9066, which ordered americans of japanese descent to be gathered into internment camps on the reasoning that they might be involved in espionage for the japanese government. now to be clear, the japanese people were talking about were american citizens -- many of them, not all of them, but many of them were american citizens. so by executive order, roosevelt forcibly removed american citizens from their homes and put them in internment camps.
