Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 5 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video it's time to talk about how a whole junk drawer of groups 各种各样的团体 have influenced public policy 公共政策. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how various political actors 不同的政治参与者 influence policy outcomes 政策结果. So various political actors -- what in the fresh heck （俚语，究竟） does that mean? Well really, what this topic is all about is to help you see that there are tons of different groups -- some more organized, some less organized, some with funding and some without, etc. -- who are able to effect change 产生变化 in our political system. +

In the last video we talked specifically about interest groups 利益集团, and I emphasized what are known as single-issue interest groups 单一议题利益集团 who basically rally around 围绕…团结起来 one policy outcome and devote all their energy and resources to that. Think of the NRA (National Rifle Association 全国步枪协会) for example, who devotes all of their energy and resources to keeping gun laws as unrestrictive as possible. Or think of pro-life and pro-choice groups 支持生命和支持堕胎选择权的团体 -- those are all single-issue interest groups. And as we saw in the last video, they have very specific mechanisms 机制 for mobilizing their resources for political change 动员资源实现政治变革. +

But here's where we open up the junk drawer and have a look at all the other kinds of groups that work for policy change as well. And there are two big categories 类别 here: social movements 社会运动 and protest movements 抗议运动. Now before I tell you what those are, let me just tell you they can't draw a hard line between 明确区分 those two kinds of movements. Rather, it's more like a dotted line 虚线, which is to say you really don't need to know specific examples of social movements and specific examples of protest movements because they often overlap 重叠. +

So let me give you two examples of these kinds of movements. First is the prohibition movement 禁酒运动 of the late 19th and early 20th century. This movement was made up of mostly women who had grown tired of the rampant drunkenness 猖獗的酗酒行为 of their men. And without much central organization 中央组织 at least in the beginning, these women marched and demonstrated 游行示威, and some of them got straight up destructive 直接进行破坏行为. For example, my favorite prohibitionist 禁酒主义者 has always been Carrie Nation. She was a deeply committed Christian and believed that alcohol was ruining the Christian morals 基督教道德 of society, and so with a Bible in one hand and a hatchet 斧头 in the other, she would walk into saloons 酒馆 and start breaking up bottles and casks 酒桶. And the men in the taverns 酒馆 would be so shocked that a woman was doing this that they'd just stare at her and let her keep chopping 砍砸. Anyway, groups like the Women's Christian Temperance Union 基督教妇女禁酒联合会 were able to coordinate their efforts 协调努力 enough to persuade legislators 立法者 to get a constitutional amendment 宪法修正案 passed outlawing 取缔 the manufacture and sale of alcohol. +

A second example is the civil rights movement 民权运动 of the 1950s and 1960s, which fought for the civil rights 民权 of black Americans. As we've talked about before, one of the key methods they used in this movement was civil disobedience 公民不服从. Martin Luther King, one of the leaders of this movement, said that by breaking unjust laws on purpose 故意违反不公正法律, they put on display 展示 the injustice bound up in those laws 法律中存在的不公正. So to that end, devotees 追随者 of the civil rights movement sat at lunch counters 午餐柜台 that were for whites only 仅供白人使用, and some of them refused to give up their seats to white passengers on buses -- all of which was illegal. And for their efforts, many of them suffered imprisonment 监禁 and physical brutality 身体暴力. But ultimately their work led to the passage of significant legislation 重要立法 like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 1964年民权法案 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 1965年投票权法案. +

Okay, so now you have a sense of social and protest movements. Now let's try to understand how they, along with other groups, affect policymaking 政策制定. So when you open the junk drawer for policy making, you find a bunch of different entities 实体 competing for influence 争夺影响力. You know, you've got social and protest movements, you've got interest groups, you've got professional organizations 专业组织, political parties 政党, you've got the military 军队, bureaucratic agencies 官僚机构, and probably a hundred others -- but those are the main ones. +

So each of these groups plays a role in getting new policies passed. Social and protest movements are really good at getting the nation's attention on certain realities that need to be changed 引起国家对某些需要改变的现实情况的关注. Then as those policies are being formed, interest groups will step in 介入 and draft potential legislation 起草可能的立法 to present to lawmakers 立法者. Then when it comes to actually making the laws, political parties and bureaucratic agencies get involved. And then it comes time to implement and execute the law 实施和执行法律, so bureaucratic agencies figure out the rules and regulations 制定规章制度 to accomplish that. And then once the law is in place 生效, maybe it's going to be implemented well or not, and if not, social and protest movements might spring up 兴起 to get the nation's attention, and the whole process starts over again. +

So the point is, there are a lot of political actors that take the stage 登上舞台 and play their roles when new policies need to be enacted 制定. Sometimes they're more successful, and sometimes they're less successful, but they are always working nonetheless 尽管如此. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。目前我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第五单元，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈各类团体是如何影响公共政策的。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释各种政治参与者是如何影响政策结果的。那么，各种政治参与者 —— 这到底是什么意思呢？嗯，实际上，这个话题的核心是帮助你认识到存在着大量不同的团体 —— 有些组织性强，有些组织性弱，有些有资金支持，有些没有资金支持，等等 —— 这些团体能够对我们的政治体系产生影响。 +

在上一个视频中，我们专门谈到了利益集团，并且我强调了所谓的单一议题利益集团，这些集团基本上围绕着一个政策结果展开活动，并将所有的精力和资源都投入其中。例如全国步枪协会（NRA），他们将所有的精力和资源都用于让枪支法律尽可能宽松。或者想想支持生命权和支持堕胎权的团体 —— 这些都是单一议题利益集团。正如我们在上一个视频中看到的，他们有非常具体的机制来调动资源以推动政治变革。 +

但在这里，我们打开 “杂物抽屉”，看看其他所有致力于推动政策变革的团体。这里有两大类：社会运动和抗议运动。在我告诉你这些是什么之前，我得说，很难在这两种运动之间划出一条明确的界限。更确切地说，这更像是一条虚线，也就是说，你其实不需要知道社会运动和抗议运动的具体例子，因为它们常常相互重叠。 +

所以我给你举两个这类运动的例子。第一个是19世纪末20世纪初的禁酒运动。这个运动主要由女性组成，她们对自己丈夫肆意酗酒的行为感到厌烦。至少在一开始，这些女性的行动没有太多的中央组织，她们游行示威，有些人甚至采取了破坏行为。例如，我最喜欢的禁酒主义者卡丽·内申（Carrie Nation）。她是一位坚定的基督徒，认为酒精正在破坏社会的基督教道德，所以她一手拿着《圣经》，一手拿着斧头，走进酒馆，开始砸瓶子和酒桶。酒馆里的男人们对一个女人做出这样的举动感到非常震惊，他们只是盯着她，任由她砍砸。不管怎样，像基督教妇女禁酒联盟（Women's Christian Temperance Union）这样的团体能够协调他们的努力，说服立法者通过一项宪法修正案，禁止酒精的制造和销售。 +

第二个例子是20世纪50年代和60年代的民权运动，这场运动为美国黑人的民权而战。正如我们之前谈到的，这场运动使用的关键方法之一是公民不服从。这场运动的领导人之一马丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King）说，通过故意违反不公正的法律，他们展示了这些法律中存在的不公正。所以，为了这个目标，民权运动的追随者们坐在只供白人使用的午餐柜台前，有些人在公共汽车上拒绝给白人乘客让座 —— 所有这些行为都是违法的。由于他们的努力，他们中的许多人遭受了监禁和身体上的暴力对待。但最终，他们的工作促使重要的立法得以通过，比如1964年的《民权法案》（Civil Rights Act of 1964）和1965年的《选举权法案》（Voting Rights Act of 1965）。 +

好的，现在你对社会运动和抗议运动有了一定的了解。现在让我们试着理解它们与其他团体是如何影响政策制定的。所以，当你打开政策制定的 “杂物抽屉” 时，你会发现有许多不同的实体在争夺影响力。你知道的，有社会运动和抗议运动，有利益集团，有专业组织，有政党，有军队，有官僚机构，可能还有上百个其他团体 —— 但这些是主要的团体。 +

所以这些团体中的每一个在新政策的通过过程中都扮演着一个角色。社会运动和抗议运动非常善于让国家关注到某些需要改变的现实情况。然后，在制定这些政策的时候，利益集团会介入并起草潜在的立法提交给立法者。然后，当真正制定法律的时候，政党和官僚机构会参与进来。接着，到了实施和执行法律的时候，官僚机构会制定相关的规章制度来完成这项工作。然后，一旦法律生效，它可能会被很好地实施，也可能不会，如果没有得到很好的实施，社会运动和抗议运动可能会兴起，以引起国家的关注，整个过程又重新开始。 +

所以重点是，当需要制定新政策时，有很多政治参与者会登上舞台并发挥他们的作用。有时他们非常成功，有时则不太成功，但无论如何，他们一直在努力。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取复习资料包，这将帮助你在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那就一定要订阅，我会照办的。海姆勒，退出。 +
