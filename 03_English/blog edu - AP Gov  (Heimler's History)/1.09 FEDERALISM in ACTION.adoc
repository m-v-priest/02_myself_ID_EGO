Well hey then, welcome back to Heimler's History. Now over the course of 在……期间 the last couple of videos, we've been talking about Unit 1 of the AP Government curriculum -- namely 也就是；即 the concept of federalism 联邦制概念. We've gone through 研究；审阅 the Constitution and some Supreme Court cases to see how federalism works. But in this video, let's talk about some current examples of federalism in action 联邦制实际运行的例子. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked well （形象表达，意为获取知识）, then let's get to it. +

So here's what we're trying to do in this video: Explain how the distribution of powers 权力分配 among the three federal branches and between the national and state governments impacts policymaking 影响政策制定. So the first thing to mention is that because federalism divides power between federal and state and local governments, that means that there are more access points 途径 for stakeholders 利益相关者 to influence policy outcomes 影响政策结果. Remember, stakeholders are folks like you and me who are affected by the outcome of legislation 立法结果. Because federalism divides power this way, we have a lot more places where we can get involved in those outcomes. +

But national policy is also constrained by 受到……限制 the sharing of power, and for that let me give you two current examples: environmental regulations 环境法规 and the legalization of marijuana 大麻合法化. That should be spicy （此处意为“很有意思；很有看点”）. +

Okay, so first, federalism is illustrated by 通过……说明 environmental regulation 环境监管. In 2015, President Obama led the United States into an international accord 国际协议 called the Paris Agreement 巴黎协定. Lots of leaders around the world were deeply concerned about climate change 气候变化 and melting ice caps 融化的冰盖 and rising ocean levels 海平面上升 and the heating up of the earth which would eventually leave us all looking like a bunch of old monkeys' kneecaps （形象表述，意为处境糟糕）. +

Now in order to enter a treaty like this, it would normally be by the approval of the Senate 参议院批准 because that power is given to them in the Constitution. But the Senate was a majority Republican 共和党占多数, and -- well -- to put it mildly 委婉地说, they were not big fans of this agreement. So Obama entered the agreement by executive order 行政命令 (and how he did that is beyond the scope of what we're talking about here -- just know that that's how it was done). +

Anyway, when the United States became a member nation of the Paris Agreement, that meant that all sorts of new environmental regulations were imposed on 施加于 the state. And so all 50 states were required to submit to 服从；遵守 these regulations and reduce their carbon emissions 碳排放. However, when Donald Trump won the presidency, he pledged to 承诺 remove the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, which he did. But what's interesting is that some states decided to keep the regulations imposed by the Paris Agreement -- case in point 例如: California. So that means that if you own a factory in California and you want to emit greenhouse gases 排放温室气体, you have to abide by 遵守 the much stricter state limits rather than the looser federal limits 更宽松的联邦限制. +

Anyway, just in case you were wondering, when Joe Biden was elected president, he went ahead and got us back into the Paris Agreement. So this very much has to do with 与……有关 the political ideology 政治意识形态 of the president. +

Okay, now another example of federalism in action 联邦制实际体现 is the legalization of marijuana -- the old wacky tobacco （对大麻的一种俗称）. And here's where I tell you that under the heading of 在……主题下 federalism, we often talk about states as laboratories for democracy 民主实验室. And what that means is that states will pass certain laws, and then representatives in the federal government and other states will see how it goes within that state in order to determine if that's a law that needs to be passed nationally 全国性通过. And the legalization of marijuana is very much an example of the laboratory of democracy concept 民主实验室概念. +

So marijuana has been illegal federally 联邦层面上 since the end of the 1930s, but the crackdown 打击 really came during President Richard Nixon's War on Drugs 禁毒战争. In 1970, Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act 管制物质法案 which stipulated 规定 severe punishments for possession and use of marijuana 持有和使用大麻的严厉惩罚. Now by the time the 80s and 90s came around, there was a growing body of research 越来越多的研究 showing that marijuana could be used as a therapeutic 治疗药物 in certain medical cases. And so in 1996, California voted to legalize medical marijuana 医用大麻合法化, and they did so by a statewide vote 全州投票. After that, several states followed suit 效仿；跟着做. +

And that brings us to 2012 when Colorado legalized recreational marijuana 休闲大麻合法化. But here's the weird thing: In 2012, possession of marijuana was still a federal crime 联邦罪行 -- like nothing had changed on the federal level. But if you were a Colorado resident, you could now go down to your local marijuana shop and legally break the federal law 合法违反联邦法律. To which I say... what? Like, to possess marijuana was legal in Colorado but illegal in the United States. How does that work? +

Well, remember the role of the president. The president is the executive of the federal government 联邦政府行政首脑, which is to say the president enforces the law 执行法律. Obama agreed with the legalization of marijuana, and so he basically just said, "Yes it's illegal, but I'm not going to be devoting any federal resources to enforcing those laws in Colorado." （投入联邦资源执行法律）So again we see here federalism in action 联邦制的实际运行. +

And Colorado has very much been a laboratory for democracy here. The federal government and other states are closely watching how this whole thing plays out 发展；展开 in this state to see whether this would be a good national policy. And ever since Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana, 18 more states have followed suit 效仿. +

== 中文释义

好的，以下是翻译内容：

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课（Heimler's History）。在过去的几个视频中，我们一直在讨论美国大学预修课程政府学（AP Government）的第一单元——也就是联邦制的概念。我们研究了美国宪法和一些最高法院的案例，以了解联邦制是如何运作的。但在这个视频中，让我们来谈谈一些联邦制在当下实际运作的例子。如果你已经准备好汲取知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

以下是我们在这个视频中要做的事情：解释联邦政府三个分支之间以及联邦政府与州政府之间的权力分配是如何影响政策制定的。首先要提到的是，由于联邦制将权力在联邦、州和地方政府之间进行划分，这意味着利益相关者有更多途径来影响政策结果。记住，利益相关者是像你我这样会受到立法结果影响的人。因为联邦制这样划分权力，我们有更多的途径可以参与到这些结果中。 +

但是国家政策也受到权力共享的限制，为此我给你们举两个当下的例子：环境法规和大麻合法化。这应该会很有意思。 +

好的，首先，环境法规体现了联邦制。2015年，奥巴马（Obama）总统带领美国加入了一项名为《巴黎协定》（Paris Agreement）的国际协议。世界上许多领导人都对气候变化、冰川融化、海平面上升以及地球升温深感担忧，地球升温最终会让我们都变得像一群老猴子的膝盖骨一样（形容不堪的样子）。 +

要加入这样的条约，通常需要得到参议院的批准，因为宪法赋予了参议院这项权力。但当时参议院中共和党占多数，说得委婉些，他们不太喜欢这项协议。所以奥巴马通过行政命令加入了该协议（他是如何做到的超出了我们这里讨论的范围——只需知道就是这样做的）。 +

总之，当美国成为《巴黎协定》的成员国后，这意味着各种新的环境法规被强加给各州。因此，所有50个州都被要求遵守这些法规并减少碳排放。然而，当唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）赢得总统大选后，他承诺将美国从《巴黎协定》中撤出，他也确实这么做了。但有趣的是，一些州决定保留《巴黎协定》规定的法规——加利福尼亚州（California）就是一个典型例子。这意味着，如果你在加利福尼亚州拥有一家工厂，并且想要排放温室气体，你必须遵守更为严格的州级限制，而不是较为宽松的联邦限制。 +

不管怎样，如果你想知道的话，当乔·拜登（Joe Biden）当选总统后，他让美国重新加入了《巴黎协定》。所以这在很大程度上与总统的政治意识形态有关。 +

好的，联邦制实际运作的另一个例子是大麻合法化——那种老掉牙的神奇烟草（一种调侃说法）。在这里我要告诉你们，在联邦制的框架下，我们经常将各州称为民主的实验室。这意味着各州会通过某些法律，然后联邦政府的代表和其他州会观察这些法律在该州的实施情况，以确定这是否是一项需要在全国范围内通过的法律。大麻合法化就是民主实验室概念的一个很好的例子。 +

自20世纪30年代末以来，大麻在联邦层面一直是非法的，但真正的打击是在理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）总统的禁毒战争期间。1970年，国会通过了《管制物质法》（Controlled Substances Act），该法案规定了对持有和使用大麻的严厉惩罚。到了20世纪80年代和90年代，越来越多的研究表明，大麻在某些医疗案例中可以用作治疗药物。因此，1996年，加利福尼亚州通过全州投票决定将医用大麻合法化。在那之后，几个州也纷纷效仿。 +

然后到了2012年，科罗拉多州（Colorado）将娱乐用大麻合法化。但奇怪的是：2012年，持有大麻在联邦层面仍然是一项犯罪——在联邦层面没有任何变化。但如果你是科罗拉多州的居民，你现在可以去当地的大麻商店，合法地违反联邦法律。我就想说……这是怎么回事？也就是说，持有大麻在科罗拉多州是合法的，但在美国却是非法的。这是怎么运作的呢？ +

嗯，记住总统的角色。总统是联邦政府的行政长官，也就是说总统负责执行法律。奥巴马赞同大麻合法化，所以他基本上只是说：“是的，这是非法的，但我不会投入任何联邦资源在科罗拉多州执行这些法律。”所以我们再次看到了联邦制的实际运作。 +

在这方面，科罗拉多州在很大程度上一直是民主的实验室。联邦政府和其他州都在密切关注这件事在该州的发展情况，以确定这是否会是一项好的国家政策。自从科罗拉多州和华盛顿州（Washington）将娱乐用大麻合法化以来，又有18个州纷纷效仿。 +

好的，感谢观看。这里为美国大学预修课程政府学准备的学习资料包将帮助你在课堂上获得A，并在5月的考试中获得5分（AP考试满分）。如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那么一定要订阅，我会满足你的要求。关于第一单元的更多视频，这里有一个播放列表。海姆勒（Heimler）退场。 +
