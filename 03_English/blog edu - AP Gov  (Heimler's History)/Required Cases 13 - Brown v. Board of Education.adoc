Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at yet another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 Brown v. the Board of Education 布朗诉教育委员会案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +  

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. What we call Brown v. the Board of Education was actually a series of cases consolidated 合并 into one, and all of them had to do with racial segregation 种族隔离 in schools. So as the result of Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法（美国历史上种族隔离法）in the South, many states had separate schools for white children and black children, and this was justified 证明合理 based on the Supreme Court's ruling 裁决 in another landmark case 里程碑案件 from 1896 called Plessy v. Ferguson 普莱西诉弗格森案, which established 确立 the "separate but equal" doctrine 原则. What that meant is that the court ruled that racial segregation in public facilities 公共设施 was indeed constitutional 合宪的 as long as the separate facilities were equal. +  

The case that we're considering -- Brown v. the Board of Education -- came about because a black family tried to get their daughter enrolled in 入学 a white school that was close to their house, but they were denied admission 拒绝接收 and thus were required to bus 用校车接送 their daughter to a much more distant black school. Lower courts 下级法院 heard this case and upheld 维持 the precedent 先例 set in Plessy, and on appeal 上诉 the case came before the Supreme Court. +  

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中? Well, Brown and the other advocates 倡导者 argued that racial segregation in schools was a violation 违反 of the Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款 of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案. The lawyer for Brown, Thurgood Marshall, argued using new findings 研究结果 in social science about racism, saying that even if separate facilities were equal in terms of funding etc., the very fact of separation was inherently 本质上 unequal. To separate black children from white children, Marshall argued, did damage to the psyche 心理 of black children and instilled in 灌输 them an inferiority 自卑感 that was not easily shed 摆脱. +  

So in light of that, what was the decision? Well, as I've told you in other videos, it is a rare thing for the Supreme Court to overturn 推翻 existing precedent, but in this case by unanimous decision 一致裁决 that is exactly what they did. The court agreed that separate facilities violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, thus overturning the precedent set in Plessy v. Ferguson. In his written opinion, Chief Justice Earl Warren said this: "To separate black children from others of similar age and qualifications solely 仅仅 because of their race generates 产生 a feeling of inferiority as to their status 地位 in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone 消除. We conclude that in the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." +  

Okay, now why does this case matter? Well, it matters first of all because it was a massive judicial 司法的 victory for the burgeoning 蓬勃发展的 civil rights movement 民权运动. The movement -- which really began picking up steam 积聚力量 in the 1950s -- sought 寻求 all kinds of legislative 立法的 and judicial acts 司法行为 which would acknowledge 承认 the equality of black and white Americans, and the Brown case was a massive step in that direction. However, as you can probably imagine, many of the southern states for whom school segregation was the norm 常态 resisted integration tegration 抵制 integration mightily 强烈地. +  

Unfortunately, these states were given some license 许可 to do so because of the vague 模糊的 wording 措辞 of the Supreme Court's decision. The court ordered that schools be integrated with "all deliberate speed 尽一切合理速度", and while we understand exactly what they meant by that (like, do it now), southerners found just enough latitude 回旋余地 in that phrase to stall 拖延. "All right, let's go let's get those schools integrated now. Well, when it comes to speed, we would like to obey the dictate 命令 of the Supreme Court and be very deliberate about it. So y'all let us alone while we go put some real time into figuring out how fast we can rightly go." Anyway, while the Brown decision was in fact a great victory on paper, it was quite a while before schools were integrated -- but that's a video for another time. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即“布朗诉教育委员会案（Brown v. the Board of Education）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

一如既往，我们先从案件事实讲起。我们所说的“布朗诉教育委员会案”实际上是一系列合并为一个的案件，所有案件都与学校中的种族隔离有关。由于南方的吉姆·克劳法（Jim Crow laws），许多州为白人儿童和黑人儿童设立了 separate schools（隔离学校），而这一做法的依据是最高法院在1896年另一个具有里程碑意义的案件“普莱西诉弗格森案（Plessy v. Ferguson）”中的裁决，该裁决确立了“隔离但平等（separate but equal）”原则。这意味着法院裁定，只要隔离的设施是平等的，公共设施中的种族隔离就确实是合宪的。 +  

我们正在讨论的“布朗诉教育委员会案”源于一个黑人家庭试图让他们的女儿进入离家很近的一所白人学校，但遭到拒绝，因此不得不让女儿乘坐校车到更远的黑人学校就读。下级法院审理了此案，并维持了“普莱西案”确立的先例，该案在上诉后提交至最高法院。 +  

这里涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？布朗及其他倡导者认为，学校中的种族隔离违反了第十四修正案（14th Amendment）的平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）。布朗的律师瑟古德·马歇尔（Thurgood Marshall）利用关于种族主义的社会科学新发现进行辩护，称即使隔离的设施在资金等方面是平等的，隔离这一事实本身就是内在不平等的。马歇尔认为，将黑人儿童与白人儿童隔离开来，会损害黑人儿童的心理，并在他们心中灌输一种难以摆脱的自卑感。 +  

鉴于此，判决结果如何呢？正如我在其他视频中提到的，最高法院推翻现有先例的情况很少见，但在本案中，他们以一致裁决正是这样做的。法院认定，隔离设施违反了第十四修正案的平等保护条款，从而推翻了“普莱西诉弗格森案”确立的先例。首席大法官厄尔·沃伦（Earl Warren）在其书面意见中指出：“仅因种族而将黑人儿童与年龄和资质相似的其他儿童隔离开来，会使他们产生自己在社区中地位低下的感觉，这可能会对他们的心灵造成难以消除的影响。我们的结论是，在公共教育领域，‘隔离但平等’原则没有立足之地。隔离的教育设施本质上是不平等的。” +  


现在，这个案件为何重要呢？首先，它是蓬勃发展的民权运动（civil rights movement）取得的重大司法胜利。这场运动在20世纪50年代真正开始兴起，寻求各种立法和司法行动来承认美国黑人和白人的平等，而“布朗案”是朝着这个方向迈出的一大步。然而，正如你可能想象的那样，许多将学校隔离视为常态的南方州强烈抵制融合。 +  

不幸的是，由于最高法院裁决的措辞模糊，这些州被赋予了一定的抵制空间。法院命令学校以“所有刻意的速度（all deliberate speed）”实现融合，尽管我们完全理解他们的意思（比如“现在就做”），但南方人在这个短语中找到了足够的回旋余地来拖延。“好吧，我们现在就去让那些学校融合。说到速度，我们希望遵守最高法院的指令，并非常谨慎地对待它。所以在我们花时间弄清楚我们到底能有多快之前，请你们不要打扰我们。” 无论如何，尽管“布朗案”在纸面上确实是一个伟大的胜利，但学校实现融合还需要很长时间——但那是另一个视频的内容了。 +  

以上就是你需要了解的关于“布朗诉教育委员会案”的内容。如果你需要，我这里有关于所有其他必修案例的视频。如果你需要帮助在课堂上取得A的成绩并在五月份的考试中获得5分，那么点击这里获取我的复习资料包，所有梦想都将成真。最后，如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作它们，那么一定要订阅，我会照做的。我说完了。 +
