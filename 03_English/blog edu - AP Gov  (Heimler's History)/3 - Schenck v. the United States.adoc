Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to be looking at yet another one of your required 必修的 Supreme Court cases for the AP Government curriculum 教学大纲, namely Schenck v. the United States. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked（幽默表达：开动脑筋）, then let's get to it. +

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case 案件事实. In 1917, Congress passed a law called the Espionage Act 间谍法, and its purpose in part was to outlaw any hindrances 妨碍，阻碍 to military recruitment. Now this was right smack in the middle 正值……之时 of America's involvement in World War One, and the draft 征兵 had just started that year. So a guy by the name of Charles Schenck, who was a member of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia, was not a big fan of the military draft. So he wrote up a pamphlet 小册子 which encouraged young American men to resist the draft. +

In the pamphlet, Schenck claimed that the draft was nothing more than intimidation 恐吓 that required resistance, and said that it was really no different than a form of involuntary 非自愿的 servitude 奴役, which of course was outlawed by the 13th Amendment 第十三修正案. Schenck went ahead and distributed 分发 something like 15,000 of these pamphlets, after which he was summarily 立即地 arrested and sent to trial for breaking the law — which is to say the Espionage Act — and after the ruling was appealed 上诉, the case ended up before the Supreme Court. +

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake in this case? Well, it was clear that Schenck had violated the Espionage Act, but he argued back that his First Amendment 第一修正案 right to free speech 言论自由 was violated, and therefore that section of the Espionage Act was unconstitutional 违宪的. In Schenck's mind, he had every right to protest 抗议 the war, and if the government silenced 镇压 his dissent 异议, it would be a tyrannical 专制的 government overreach 权力过度扩张. So was he right? Well, let's look at the decision the court handed down. +

As it turns out, the court did not agree with Mr. Schenck. The court ruled in a unanimous 一致的 decision that Schenck's First Amendment rights were not violated because he wasn't merely protesting the draft. Instead, his words were actively encouraging men to avoid the draft, and that was something different altogether. And at the end of the day, it was not protected speech 受宪法保护的言论. And why not? Because as Oliver Wendell Holmes, wrote in his majority opinion 多数意见书: "The most stringent 严格的 protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger 明确而现实的危险 that they will bring about the substantive 实质性的 evils that Congress has a right to prevent." +

And that phrase "clear and present danger" created a test 标准 by which protected and unprotected speech can be measured. Like, it's clear that if you yell fire in a crowded theater and everyone freaks out and tramples each other and maybe gets injured in order to leave, that cannot fall under the protection of the First Amendment. In doing that, you have caused harm to others by your words which have induced 引发 a clear and present danger to their health and well-being. +

So now let's consider why this case matters. First of all, it matters because it created a very clear standard for the silencing 压制 of speech. In this case, Holmes mentioned in his written opinion that the government has more right to infringe upon 侵犯 the right to free speech during a time of war because, quote, "many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance 妨碍 to its effort that their utterance 言论 will not be endured 忍受 so long as men fight, and that no court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right." So the clear and present danger test emerged out of this case to be applied to such situations. +

However, the clear and present danger test is no longer used, and it has been superseded 被取代 by the Brandenburg test, which makes a clear distinction between the intent 意图 of speech and its likelihood 可能性 to incite 煽动 lawless activity 非法行为. In other words, if it's clear that the speech did not intend to incite lawless action, then even if it is incendiary 煽动性的 and offensive 冒犯性的, the speech is usually protected. And really what you should remember here is that the Brandenburg test set an even higher bar 更高门槛 for the government to clear before silencing speech. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个最高法院的必学案例，也就是 “申克诉美国案”（Schenck v. the United States）。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

和往常一样，我们先来看这个案件的事实。1917年，国会通过了一项名为《间谍法》（Espionage Act）的法律，其部分目的是将任何妨碍征兵的行为定为非法。当时美国正处于参与第一次世界大战（World War One）的过程中，并且那年征兵刚刚开始。有个叫查尔斯·申克（Charles Schenck）的人，他是费城（Philadelphia）社会党的一名成员，他非常不喜欢征兵。于是他撰写了一份小册子，鼓励美国的年轻男性抵制征兵。 +

在这份小册子中，申克声称征兵只不过是一种需要抵制的恐吓行为，并且说这与一种非自愿劳役没有什么不同，而这种非自愿劳役当然是被第十三修正案（13th Amendment）所禁止的。申克继续分发了大约15000份这样的小册子，之后他被迅速逮捕，并因违反《间谍法》而被送上法庭——也就是说，因为违反了《间谍法》——在对裁决提出上诉后，这个案件最终被提交到最高法院。 +

那么这个案件所涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？很明显，申克违反了《间谍法》，但他反驳说，他的第一修正案（First Amendment）所赋予的言论自由权受到了侵犯，因此《间谍法》的这一部分是违宪的。在申克看来，他完全有权抗议这场战争，如果政府压制他的异议，那就是政府的专制越权行为。那么他说得对吗？嗯，我们来看看法院的裁决。 +

结果是，法院不同意申克先生的观点。法院一致裁定，申克的第一修正案权利没有受到侵犯，因为他不仅仅是在抗议征兵。相反，他的言论是在积极鼓励男性逃避征兵，而这完全是另一回事。归根结底，他的言论不受保护。为什么不受保护呢？因为正如奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯（Oliver Wendell Holmes）在多数意见中所写的：“对言论自由最严格的保护，也不会保护一个在剧院里虚假地大喊失火从而引起恐慌的人。每个案件的问题在于，所使用的言论在当时的情况下，其性质是否会造成一种明显且现实的危险，即它们会引发国会有权防止的实质性危害。” +

“明显且现实的危险” 这个短语创建了一种衡量受保护言论和不受保护言论的标准。很明显，如果你在拥挤的剧院里大喊失火，导致每个人都惊慌失措，互相踩踏，甚至可能因此受伤，那么这种言论就不属于第一修正案的保护范围。在这种情况下，你的言论造成了对他人的伤害，因为它们给他人的健康和福祉带来了明显且现实的危险。 +

那么现在我们来思考这个案件为什么重要。首先，它很重要是因为它为压制言论制定了一个非常明确的标准。在这个案件中，霍姆斯在他的书面意见中提到，政府在战争时期更有权侵犯言论自由权，因为，引用他的话：“在和平时期可以说的很多事情，在战争时期会对战争努力造成阻碍，只要战争还在进行，这些言论就不会被容忍，而且没有法院会认为这些言论受到任何宪法权利的保护。” 因此，“明显且现实的危险” 这一标准在这个案件中产生，并适用于此类情况。 +

然而，“明显且现实的危险” 这一标准不再被使用，它已被 “布兰登堡标准”（Brandenburg test）所取代，该标准明确区分了言论的意图和它煽动非法活动的可能性。换句话说，如果很明显言论并没有煽动非法行动的意图，那么即使它具有煽动性且令人反感，这种言论通常也是受保护的。真正需要记住的是，“布兰登堡标准” 为政府在压制言论之前设定了更高的门槛。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的 “申克诉美国案”（Schenck v. the United States）。如果你想要一个复习资料包来帮助你在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分，那就点击这里。另外，我有一个 “海姆勒测试”，用来帮助我决定是否应该继续制作这些视频。如果你订阅，我就会继续制作。我下线了。 +
