Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 Tinker v. Des Moines 廷克诉得梅因案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. And you know this is a really interesting case for high schoolers because it very much set the parameters 范围；界限 for the freedom of speech 言论自由 that you have on school property 校园. +  

Okay, as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. In 1965, Senator Robert Kennedy called for a Christmas truce 休战 in the war in Vietnam, and an activist 积极分子 family called the Tinkers decided they wanted to support this controversial 有争议的 measure 措施 in symbolic protest 象征性抗议. To that end 为此, four of their children and one of their friends made a plan to wear black armbands 臂章 to school in support of the Christmas truce. Now to put it mildly 坦率地说, the nation was a piping hot mess （俚语，一团糟）regarding the Vietnam War -- there were protests and violence, and so this was very much not a neutral 中立的 issue. +  

So when the school administration 学校管理层 heard about the Tinkers' plan, they went ahead and wrote a policy saying that any student wearing a protest armband to school would be asked to remove it or face suspension 停学 until they were willing to come back to school without it. And so the Tinker children decided to wear the armbands anyway, and they got suspended, upon which their parents filed suit 提起诉讼. +  

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中? This was a case about the First Amendment's 第一修正案 protection of free speech. Now remember what I've been saying in all these videos on civil liberties 公民自由: our rights are not absolute 绝对的 -- there are limits to them. And the question here is whether a student protest on school property, silent and symbolic 象征性的 as it was concerning a highly contentious 有争议的 issue, should be allowed. After all 毕竟, school administrators do have the responsibility to create a good learning environment as free from conflict 冲突 as possible. And so was this particular prohibition 禁止 from the administration a reasonable infringement 侵犯 on the student's right to free speech? +  

Well, to answer the question, let's see how the case was decided. In a 7-2 decision, the court ruled that this was a violation 违反 of the student's right to free speech. And while the court acknowledged 承认 that there were valid 正当的 constitutional reasons for an administration to restrict 限制 the speech of students on some occasions, this case did not meet the criteria 标准. In fact, the court created what's called the substantial disruption test 重大干扰标准 as a decision-making criterion 标准 for how school administrators could constitutionally 符合宪法地 limit student speech. Basically 基本上, it just says that if a school administration is going to restrict student speech, they must be able to demonstrate 证明 that the speech in question would "materially and substantially interfere with 严重干扰 the requirements of appropriate discipline 纪律 in the operation of the school." And since the wearing of these armbands caused no material or substantial disruption 扰乱, it was deemed 认定为 a violation of the student's First Amendment rights. That's because, as Justice Abe Fortas stated in the majority opinion 多数意见, "It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed 放弃 their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." +  

Okay, now why does this case matter? It matters because it set the parameters for the question of free speech on school campuses 校园 and has been cited 引用 in many other similar cases to guide justices in their ruling 裁决. Before you decide to just go say anything you want at school thinking Tinker will protect you, I should mention that subsequent 随后的 cases have refined 完善 the relationship between students' free speech and the school administration's responsibility to create a conflict-free learning environment. For example, in 1985, a case called Bethel School District v. Fraser took up the question about obscene 淫秽的 and vulgar 粗俗的 speech at school. In this case, a student gave a speech that was overflowing with 充满 sexual innuendos 性暗示 and was disciplined 处分 as a result. So in this case, the court decided that vulgar speech on a school campus was not the same as political speech like the students in the Tinker case had engaged in 参与, and so they ruled in favor of 作出对…有利的裁决 the administration in that case, and thus decided that there are legitimate 合法的 restrictions 限制 on student speech. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即“廷克诉得梅因案（Tinker v. Des Moines）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。你知道这对高中生来说是一个非常有趣的案例，因为它在很大程度上设定了学生在学校范围内的言论自由边界。 +  

一如既往，我们先从案件事实讲起。1965年，参议员罗伯特·肯尼迪（Robert Kennedy）呼吁在越南战争中实行圣诞节休战，一个名叫廷克（Tinker）的活跃分子家庭决定以象征性抗议的方式支持这一有争议的举措。为此，他们的四个孩子和一个朋友计划戴着黑色臂章上学，以支持圣诞节休战。毫不夸张地说，当时美国国内关于越南战争的争议极其激烈——到处都是抗议和暴力活动，因此这绝非一个中立的话题。 +  

当学校管理层听说廷克家孩子的计划后，他们随即制定了一项政策，规定任何戴着抗议臂章上学的学生都将被要求取下臂章，否则将被停学，直至愿意不带臂章返校。然而，廷克家的孩子们还是决定戴上臂章，结果被停学，他们的父母因此提起诉讼。 +  

这里涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？这是一个关于宪法第一修正案（First Amendment）保护言论自由的案件。记住我在所有关于公民自由的视频中一直在说的：我们的权利并非绝对——它们是有限制的。这里的问题在于，学生在学校范围内进行的抗议活动，尽管是无声的象征性抗议，且涉及高度争议性的问题，是否应该被允许。毕竟，学校管理者有责任营造一个尽可能远离冲突的良好学习环境。那么，管理层的这一特定禁令是否是对学生言论自由权的合理限制呢？ +  

为了回答这个问题，我们来看看案件的判决结果。最高法院以7比2的裁决认定这一禁令侵犯了学生的言论自由权。尽管法院承认，在某些情况下，管理层有合理的宪法理由限制学生的言论，但本案并不符合这些条件。事实上，法院制定了所谓的“重大干扰标准（substantial disruption test）”，作为学校管理者如何以合宪方式限制学生言论的决策标准。基本上，该标准指出，如果学校管理层要限制学生言论，必须能够证明相关言论会“实质性且严重地干扰学校运作中适当纪律的要求”。由于佩戴这些臂章并未造成实质性或严重的干扰，因此被认定为侵犯了学生的第一修正案权利。正如大法官 Abe Fortas 在多数意见中所说：“很难说学生或教师在进入校门时就放弃了其言论或表达的宪法权利。” +  

现在，这个案件为何重要呢？它之所以重要，是因为它设定了校园内言论自由问题的边界，并在许多其他类似案件中被引用，以指导大法官们的裁决。不过，在你认为可以在学校里想说什么就说什么、认为“廷克案”会保护你之前，我需要提醒你，后续案件进一步明确了学生言论自由与学校管理层营造无冲突学习环境的责任之间的关系。例如，1985年的“贝瑟尔学区诉弗雷泽案（Bethel School District v. Fraser）”探讨了学校里淫秽和粗俗言论的问题。在该案中，一名学生发表了充满性暗示的演讲，结果受到了纪律处分。因此，法院判定，校园内的粗俗言论与“廷克案”中学生所进行的政治言论不同，于是在该案中支持了管理层的决定，从而认定对学生言论的合理限制是存在的。 +  

以上就是你需要了解的关于“廷克诉得梅因案”的内容。如果你需要帮助在课堂上取得A的成绩并在五月份的考试中获得5分，请点击这里获取我的复习资料包。嘿，如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，并通过点击订阅按钮来表达你象征性言论的权利，我会满足你的愿望。海姆勒，退出。 +
