Hey there and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now in the last video we started our jaunt 短途旅行；游览 into the AP Government curriculum, and in this video we're going to keep on jaunting. Last time we talked about the ideals of democracy, but in this video it's time to talk about the different types of democracy. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +
Okay, so here's what we're trying to do in this video: explain how models 模式 of representative democracy 代议制民主 are visible in major institutions, policies, events, or debates in the U.S. Easy peasy cottage cheesy. Okay, so there are three different models of democracy that you need to know about, and all of them show up in American institutions. +
The first is participatory democracy 参与式民主，which emphasizes 强调 broad participation in politics and civil society. This model wants as many people as possible to come to the democracy party, and in this form of democracy, citizens vote on laws directly (which is to say, not by means of representatives). I told you in the last video that the framers weren't really into this kind of democracy where everyone participates because most people, according to them, were uneducated, and what would they know about the nation's best interest? Additionally, the framers realized that participatory democracy would be an impossibility 不可能的事 as the nation grew. The more population you have, the more complex 复杂的 the laws that are needed to govern them, and it just wasn't practical 实际的；可行的 to have everyone voting on everything. +
However, it'll be important for you to know that even though this model was rejected as the basis for the Constitution, participatory democracy still shows up in the United States -- not much on the federal level, but more in local politics. For example, many small towns hold town hall meetings where everyone from the town can participate in local policy making. But perhaps the most significant example of participatory democracy that exists in our system today is the initiative 公民投票倡议 and the referendum 公民投票表决. +
So we have representatives who do the work of legislation 立法，but these two actions can hold those representatives accountable 有责任的；应负责任的 to the people. An initiative is when voters put a measure 措施 on the ballot 投票；选票 which they want passed into law if their representatives won't propose their desired law, then the people will do it for them. A referendum is when people oppose 反对 a law that is passed by their legislature 立法机构，and if the law is unpopular and enough people support the referendum, they can call for a vote to defeat that law. +
Okay, now the second model of democracy you should know is elite democracy 精英民主. If participatory democracy invites everyone to the party, elite democracy only invites a few. Elite democracy emphasizes limited participation by a few well-educated and informed statespeople 政治家 who are qualified 有资格的；合格的 to direct 管理；领导 the nation through law making on behalf of the people. And the argument for this model is that when you're dealing with a government as complex as the United States government is, you've got to have specialists 专家 doing its work because only those who can devote 奉献；投入 their whole lives to governance 治理；管理 even have a chance at navigating 驾驭；掌控 all that complexity. Additionally, this model, by having well-informed people at the helm 在掌权；在领导位置，can prevent the masses 群众；民众 from making unwise policy decisions. +
And there are many examples of elite democracy in our institutions today. For example, the President of the United States has the power to appoint 任命 judges to the Supreme Court, which is a decision entirely independent of the voting population. Another example is the method by which the President is elected, namely the Electoral College 选举人团. It's not the people who vote the president in, but rather a handful of electors 选举人 from the various states. And I know that probably sounds confusing, and we'll talk about it more in another unit, but for now just know that the Electoral College is an example of elite democracy working in our system today. +
The third model of democracy you need to know about is pluralist democracy 多元民主，and this one is kind of a middle ground 中间立场 between the other two in terms of who gets to participate in politics. Pluralist democracy describes group-based activism 行动主义；激进主义 by non-governmental interests 非政府利益团体 which work to impact 影响 political decision-making. So the key word here is interest groups 利益集团，which again we'll talk more about in another video, but for now you just need to understand that these are groups which form around a particular cause (like gun rights) or a particular demographic 人口群体 (like retired people), and by joining ranks with groups like these, average citizens can pool 集中；共享 their resources 资源 and have a big influence on the representatives in Congress. +
It isn't exactly participatory democracy, it's not elite democracy, but it's more like group-based democracy. And these groups raise money and try to persuade 说服 legislators 立法者 to pass laws favorable to 有利于 their cause. And by joining an interest group, it provides amplification 扩大；增强 to the voice of a single voter. You might have heard of interest groups like the National Rifle Association or the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- these are interest groups that operate today. But it's not just interest groups that exercise 行使；运用 this kind of pluralist influence. States represent interests as well. So each state represents the interest of its citizens, and since there are so many states and so many representatives in the House and the Senate, they argue back and forth and try to win the best legislation for their group. And by putting interests in competition with one another, no one interest can dominate 主导；支配 the rest. +
Okay, now hopefully you can clearly see that there is a tension 矛盾；紧张关系 between those three models, and for our purposes, we'll look at how that tension is represented in a couple of our foundational documents for this course. First, you see the tension between these three models represented in the Constitution. You can see the elite model in the fact that the Constitution provides for elected representatives that legislate on behalf of the people. You can see the pluralist model in the law making process because in order to get a law passed, various interests (both states and otherwise) have to compromise in order to get it done. And you can see the participatory model in the separation of power between the federal government and the state government. States can make their own laws provided that they don't conflict with 与... 冲突 the national laws. Now the word for that is federalism 联邦制，but we're going to give that concept its own video. +
Second, you can see the tension between these three models represented in the debate between two other foundational documents: Federalist 10 and Brutus 1. And again, these documents have their own videos, so if you want to know more, check those out. With respect to models of democracy though, Brutus championed 支持；拥护 the broad participatory model. The group who wrote this feared the tyranny 暴政；专制 of a powerful central government and wanted to keep the majority of the power in the hands of the states. Federalist 10 argued that such a fear was unfounded 无事实根据的 because in a large republic like the United States with so much diversity 多样性 in all the population, all the factions 派别；团体 would have to compete against one another, and such competition would protect the union from tyranny. +
Okay, that's what you need to know about Unit 1 Topic 2 of AP Government.

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。在上一个视频中，我们开始了对 AP 政府课程的学习，在这个视频中，我们将继续深入学习。上次我们谈到了民主理想，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈**不同类型的民主。**所以如果你准备好开动脑筋获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

好的，所以在这个视频中我们要做的是：**解释"代议制民主"的模式, 是如何体现在美国的主要机构、政策、事件或辩论中的。**这很简单。好的，**#有三种不同的民主模式#, 是你需要了解的，并且它们都在美国的机构中有所体现。 **+

**第一种是"#参与式民主#"，它强调##广泛参与##政治和公民社会。这种模式希望尽可能多的人参与到民主进程中，在这种民主形式下，公民直接对法律进行投票（也就是说，#不是通过代表来进行投票#）。**我在上一个视频中告诉过你，**制宪者们并不是真的喜欢这种每个人都参与的民主，因为在他们看来，大多数人没有受过教育，他们又怎么会知道什么对国家最有利呢？** +
此外，制宪者们意识到，*随着国家的发展，"参与式民主"是不可能实现的。人口越多，治理所需的法律就越复杂，让每个人对所有事情进行投票是不切实际的。* +

然而，你需要知道的是，尽管这种模式没有成为《宪法》的基础，**但##"参与式民主"在美国仍然存在 —— 在联邦层面不多，但在"地方政治"中更为常见。##例如，许多小镇会举行"市政厅会议"，#镇上的每个人, 都可以参与地方政策的制定。#**但在我们的体系中，*#"参与式民主"最显著的例子可能是"倡议"和"公投"。#* +

所以我们有代表们进行立法工作，但这两种行动可以让代表们对人民负责。倡议是指选民将一项措施提交到选票上，如果他们的代表不提出他们想要的法律，选民们就会自己推动这项措施成为法律。公投是指人们反对立法机构通过的一项法律，如果这项法律不受欢迎，并且有足够多的人支持公投，他们就可以要求进行投票以废除这项法律。 +

好的，你应该了解的第二种民主模式是精英民主。如果说参与式民主邀请每个人参加 “民主派对”，那么精英民主只邀请少数人。精英民主强调由少数受过良好教育且消息灵通的政治家进行有限的参与，这些政治家有资格代表人民通过立法来管理国家。支持这种模式的观点是，当你面对像美国政府这样复杂的政府时，你必须有专家来做这些工作，因为只有那些能够全身心投入到治理工作中的人，才有机会应对所有的复杂性。此外，这种模式由消息灵通的人掌舵，可以防止大众做出不明智的政策决策。 +

在我们当今的机构中，有很多精英民主的例子。例如，美国总统有权任命最高法院的法官，这一决策完全独立于选民。另一个例子是总统的选举方式，即选举人团制度。不是由人民直接选举总统，而是由来自各个州的少数选举人进行选举。我知道这可能听起来很令人困惑，我们会在另一个单元中详细讨论，但现在你只需要知道，选举人团是我们当今体系中精英民主的一个例子。 +

你需要了解的第三种民主模式是多元民主，就谁能参与政治而言，它有点介于另外两种模式之间。多元民主描述的是基于团体的非政府利益团体的积极行动，这些团体致力于影响政治决策。所以这里的关键词是利益团体，我们会在另一个视频中详细讨论，但现在你只需要明白，这些团体围绕特定的事业（比如枪支权利）或特定的人口群体（比如退休人员）而形成，普通公民通过加入这些团体，可以集中他们的资源，并对国会的代表们产生重大影响。 +

它既不是参与式民主，也不是精英民主，但它更像是基于团体的民主。这些团体筹集资金，并试图说服立法者通过有利于他们事业的法律。通过加入一个利益团体，单个选民的声音得到了放大。你可能听说过像全国步枪协会（the National Rifle Association）或全国有色人种协进会（the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People）这样的利益团体，它们都是当今运作的利益团体。但不仅仅是利益团体行使这种多元民主的影响力。各州也代表着各种利益。所以每个州都代表着其公民的利益，由于有这么多的州以及众议院和参议院中有这么多的代表，他们会相互争论，并试图为他们的团体争取到最好的立法。通过让各种利益相互竞争，没有一种利益能够主宰其他利益。 +

好的，现在希望你能清楚地看到这三种模式之间存在的矛盾，为了我们的学习目的，我们将看看这种矛盾是如何体现在本课程的一些基础文件中的。首先，你可以在《宪法》中看到这三种模式之间的矛盾。你可以看到精英模式体现在《宪法》规定由选举产生的代表代表人民进行立法这一事实上。你可以在立法过程中看到多元模式，因为为了通过一项法律，各种利益（包括各州和其他方面的利益）必须做出妥协才能实现。你可以在联邦政府和州政府之间的权力分离中看到参与式模式。各州可以制定自己的法律，只要这些法律不与国家法律冲突。这种情况的术语是联邦制，但我们会专门做一个视频来讲解这个概念。 +

第二，你可以在另外两份基础文件《联邦党人文集》第 10 篇（Federalist 10）和《布鲁图斯》第 1 篇（Brutus 1）之间的辩论中看到这三种模式之间的矛盾。再说一次，这些文件我们会有单独的视频讲解，所以如果你想了解更多，可以去看看那些视频。就民主模式而言，《布鲁图斯》第 1 篇支持广泛的参与式模式。撰写这篇文章的团体担心强大的中央政府的暴政，并希望将大部分权力掌握在各州手中。《联邦党人文集》第 10 篇则认为这种担忧是没有根据的，因为在美国这样一个人口多样性如此之多的大共和国中，所有的派别都必须相互竞争，而这种竞争将保护联邦免受暴政的侵害。 +

好的，这就是 AP 政府课程第 1 单元第 2 个 topic 你需要了解的内容。点击这里，获取一份复习资料包，如果你需要帮助在课堂上得 A 并且在五月份的考试中得 5 分，如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那就订阅吧，我会满足你的要求。海姆勒下线了。 +
