Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to be looking at another one of your required 必修的 Supreme Court cases for the AP Government curriculum 教学大纲, namely Wisconsin v. Yoder. So if you're ready to get them brain cells milked 挤出脑细胞 (幽默：开动脑筋), then let's get to it.

As always, let's begin with the facts of the case 案件事实. Leading up to this case, three Amish families 阿米什家庭 in Wisconsin removed their children from public schools 公立学校 after they had graduated from the eighth grade. By Amish reckoning, state education 国家教育 was no longer necessary after the eighth grade, and their children could learn a heck of a lot more by spending those years in vocational training 职业培训 with their family. Plus, these families were deeply concerned about the influence of worldly ideas 世俗思想 their children would pick up in high school, which were ultimately antithetical 对立的 to their religion. And hey, that's fine, right? You do you all well? +

No. Wisconsin actually had a compulsory education law 强制教育法 which mandated that children be educated up to 16 years old at a minimum. Since these kids were not yet 16, their parents had broken 违法 the law and thus were fined 罚款 the exorbitant amount of five dollars each. Now the case went to the courts which all agreed with the state, with the exception of the state supreme court 州最高法院. But eventually in 1972, it came before the Supreme Court 最高法院.

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake? Well, Jonas Yoder 乔纳斯·约德 and the other parents he represented argued that Wisconsin's compulsory education law 威斯康星州的强制教育法 violated their First Amendment rights 第一修正案权利 to the free exercise of their religion 宗教. But Wisconsin argued back that the state had a compelling 迫切的 interest in educating the children 教育孩子们 of their state, and that interest trumped 优先于 the Amish community's right to free exercise. +

If you've been watching the Topic 3 videos for Unit 3, you'll remember that the court is always trying to strike the balance between social order 社会秩序 and individual liberty 个人自由, and this case is a great example of that. Is the state right to make laws for the education of its children 教育其子女? Yes. Are the Amish families in this case right to want the government out of their religious practices 宗教活动? Of course. So which of these is more compelling to the Supreme Court? For that, let's look at how the case was decided.

In a unanimous 一致的 decision, the court ruled in favor of Yoder, arguing that the state's interest in the education of children should not trump 优先于 the ability of Amish families to exercise their religion 宗教 freely. So yes, this was considered a violation of the First Amendment rights 第一修正案权利 of the Amish family. And the court acknowledged that to force the Amish to send their children to school for two more years would be a very real threat to their way of life 生活方式. And in his majority opinion 多数意见, Chief Justice Warren Burger 首席大法官沃伦·伯吉 said this: "However strong the state's interest in universal compulsory education 普遍的强制教育, it is by no means absolute to the exclusion or subordination 从属 of all other interests." +

Okay, so why does this case matter? It matters because it set the tone for future cases involving the clash between state interest 州利益 and the free exercise of religion 宗教自由的行使. Additionally, after this case, the homeschool movement 家庭教育运动 gained a ton of traction. So if you're one of those people doing school at home in your jammies 睡衣, well, you can go hug an Amish person 阿米什人.

All right, I hope that helped. And if you need some more help, then you can click right here and grab a review packet 复习资料包, which is going to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. I've got videos explaining all the other required Supreme Court cases right here. And if you want me to keep making these videos, then the way that you can let me know that is by subscribing 订阅.
