Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at yet another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 即 Citizens United v. The Federal Election Commission 联合公民诉联邦选举委员会案. So if you're ready to get them brain cells milked, well then let's get to it. +

As always, let's begin with the facts of the case. Now this case is all about campaign finance laws 竞选资金法, and I have a whole video going into depth on that, and you can see it right over here for a more robust 详尽的 history. But here we're going to start with the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Act 两党竞选改革法案, or BCRA, passed in 2002. In addition to articulating 明确阐述 limits for individuals contributing money to political candidates 个人向政治候选人捐款的限额, there's really just one thing you need to know about this act with respect to 关于 the Citizens United case: part of the BCRA law made it illegal for corporations or non-profits 非营利组织 to engage in 从事 electioneering communications 竞选宣传 for 60 days before an election or 30 days before a primary 初选. So you want to pay a butt load of 大量的 money to smear 诋毁 a candidate? Fine. But once we hit that 60 days before the election, you got to shut your mouth. +

Now during the 2008 Democratic primaries 民主党初选, a close contest 势均力敌的竞争 for the party nomination 党内提名 was heating up 升温 between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. A conservative group called Citizens United decided to make a film called "Hillary: The Movie." The film was full of damning 确凿的；指责的 accusations 指控 against Clinton and was intended to derail 破坏 her bid for the presidency 总统竞选. However, by the time it was ready to be released, it was already during that forbidden period 禁止期 in which corporations had to keep their mouth holes shut about political candidates thanks to BCRA. And so Citizens United challenged 质疑 this portion of the law, and it went all the way to the Supreme Court 一路上诉到最高法院. +

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中；攸关? Well, Citizens United argued that BCRA's prohibition 禁止 against electioneering communications by corporations was a violation of 违反 the First Amendment's 第一修正案 protection of the freedom of speech 言论自由保护. Maybe you're like, "Wait a minute, a corporation isn't a person, so how can it have protected speech?" Well, it's too complicated to get into here, but the short story is that since the 1800s, the Supreme Court has pretty consistently ruled 裁决 that corporations are just associations of individuals 个人的联合体, and in many cases constitutional civil liberties 宪法公民自由 extend to 适用于 them as well. +

So what was the decision? It was decided five to four in favor of Citizens United 以五比四的结果支持联合公民组织. The court argued that limitations put upon 施加于 corporations for running political advertisements and communications were not materially different from 与…没有实质性区别 government censorship of speech 政府对言论的审查 toward individuals. Therefore, that part of BCRA was struck down 废除. Now ultimately for "Hillary: The Movie," it didn't really matter that much because this was decided two years after the Democratic primary. Even so, this was a victory for Citizens United nonetheless 尽管如此. +

Okay, so why does this case matter? Well, the perennial question 长期存在的问题 when it comes to campaign finance is this: since money equals speech in the political arena 政治舞台, is it fair for those with the most money to have the loudest voices? In the Citizens United case, the Supreme Court essentially said, "Yeah, that's fair." So now corporations and labor unions 工会 and non-profits and other organizations can spend as much money as they want -- provided 只要 they don't collaborate directly with 直接与…合作 the candidate on political communication -- right up to election day 直到选举日. +

The campaign finance reform laws were put into place 实施 to put the kibosh on 制止 corruption in elections 选举中的腐败, but the court ruled that just because a friendly organization is spending a bunch of money on a candidate's behalf 代表候选人 doesn't necessarily mean that the candidate owes them favors 欠他们人情 -- which is already illegal under other laws. At the end of the day 归根结底, this is an issue that still ruffles feathers 引起争议 and is far from being decided in the minds of the American public, even if it is decided in the courts. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将关注美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院（Supreme Court）案例，即 “联合公民组织诉联邦选举委员会案（Citizens United v. The Federal Election Commission）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的脑细胞，那么我们就开始吧。 +

和往常一样，我们先来看这个案件的事实。这个案件主要涉及竞选资金法，我有一整个视频深入探讨了这个问题，你可以在这里观看，了解更丰富的历史背景。但在这里，我们从2002年通过的《两党竞选资金法》（Bipartisan Campaign Finance Act，简称BCRA）开始讲起。除了明确规定个人向政治候选人捐款的限制之外，对于 “联合公民组织案（Citizens United case）”，关于这项法案你只需要知道一件事：《两党竞选资金法》的部分内容规定，在选举前60天或初选前30天，公司或非营利组织进行竞选宣传沟通是违法的。所以，如果你想花一大笔钱去抹黑一位候选人？可以。但一旦到了选举前60天这个时间段，你就得闭嘴。 +

在2008年民主党初选期间，希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）和巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）之间激烈的党内提名竞争正在升温。一个名为 “联合公民组织（Citizens United）” 的保守派团体决定制作一部名为《希拉里：一部电影》（“Hillary: The Movie”）的影片。这部电影充满了对克林顿的谴责性指控，旨在破坏她的总统竞选。然而，当这部电影准备发行时，由于《两党竞选资金法》的规定，已经到了公司必须对政治候选人保持沉默的禁言期。于是，“联合公民组织” 对这项法律的这一部分提出了挑战，这个案件一路上诉到了最高法院。 +

那么，这里涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？“联合公民组织” 认为，《两党竞选资金法》对公司进行竞选宣传沟通的禁令违反了美国宪法第一修正案所保护的言论自由。也许你会想，“等一下，公司又不是个人，它怎么会有受保护的言论呢？” 嗯，这里面的情况太复杂，无法在此详述，但简单来说，自19世纪以来，最高法院一直相当一致地裁定，公司是个人的联合体，在许多情况下，宪法规定的公民自由也适用于它们。 +

那么，最高法院的裁决是什么呢？最高法院以五比四的投票结果支持 “联合公民组织”。法院认为，对公司投放政治广告和进行政治沟通的限制，与政府对个人言论的审查在本质上没有区别。因此，《两党竞选资金法》的这一部分被推翻了。最终，对于《希拉里：一部电影》来说，这其实没那么重要，因为这个裁决是在民主党初选两年后做出的。即便如此，这对 “联合公民组织” 来说仍是一场胜利。 +

好的，那么这个案件为什么重要呢？嗯，当涉及到竞选资金时，一个长期存在的问题是：既然在政治领域金钱等同于言论，那么让最有钱的人拥有最大的话语权，这公平吗？在 “联合公民组织案” 中，最高法院基本上表示，“是的，这是公平的。” 所以现在，公司、工会、非营利组织和其他组织可以想花多少钱就花多少钱 —— 前提是它们在政治沟通方面不与候选人直接合作 —— 一直到选举日。 +

竞选资金改革法的制定是为了遏制选举中的腐败现象，但法院裁定，仅仅因为一个友好的组织代表候选人花了一大笔钱，并不一定意味着候选人就欠他们人情 —— 根据其他法律，这种情况本身就是违法的。归根结底，即使法院做出了裁决，这个问题仍然会引起争议，在美国公众的心目中，远未得到解决。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的 “联合公民组织诉联邦选举委员会案（Citizens United v. FEC）”。如果你需要，我还有关于其他所有必修案例的视频。如果你想在课堂上得A，在考试中得5分，那就点击这里获取我的复习资料包，你所有的梦想都会成真。最后，如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那就一定要订阅，我会照办的。海姆勒，退出。 +
