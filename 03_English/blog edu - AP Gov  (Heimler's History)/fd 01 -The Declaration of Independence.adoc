Well hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now in this video, we're going to consider 考虑 our first foundational document 基础文献 for AP Government, namely 即；也就是 the Declaration of Independence 独立宣言. Ever heard of it? I genuinely 真诚地 hope the answer to that question is yes, but even if it isn't, after this video you'll know everything you need to know about it for this course. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

Okay, the Declaration of Independence basically has three sections: a preamble 序言, a list of grievances 不满；抱怨 against King George III, and a resolution for independence 独立决议. And we'll focus mainly on the Preamble because what's emphasized in this course is the influence of Enlightenment ideals 启蒙思想 on the writing of this document, and the Preamble is positively bursting with 充满 the thinky-thinky of the Enlightenment. In case you don't know, it was Thomas Jefferson who wrote it. +

So the first part of the Preamble is a justification 正当理由 for why the American colonists 美国殖民者 are breaking up with 与…决裂 Britain. And here Jefferson writes: "When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve 解除 the political bands 政治纽带 which have connected them with another, and to assume 取得 among the powers of the Earth the separate and equal station 独立平等的地位 to which the laws of nature and Nature's God entitle 赋予权利 them, a decent respect 应有的尊重 to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel 驱使 them to the separation." In other words, if you're going to break up with somebody and you have to start a revolution 革命 to do it, the decent thing to do was to try to explain why you're doing it. +

Now let's stop for a moment. Why didn't the Americans just start a revolution? Why did this document have to be written? Well, the audience here is very important. I mean, Jefferson could have just sealed this document up and sent it straight to King George in an envelope -- after all, the grievances are against him. But this document was not meant to be private 私密的. It was published widely throughout the colonies 殖民地 and in the Western World. So the larger purpose of this document was twofold 双重的: number one, to rally the troops 鼓舞士气 to fight at home, and to secure foreign allies 争取外国盟友 who would be able to help the Americans win this war that by all rights 按理说 they should not have won. +

Okay, now after the first sentence, here's where the Enlightenment thought 启蒙思想 really kicks in 开始起作用: "We hold these truths to be self-evident 不证自明的, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed 赋予 by their creator with certain unalienable rights 不可剥夺的权利, that among these are life, liberty 自由 and the pursuit of happiness 追求幸福." Now as I mentioned in the topic video on this subject, this line is a clear example of natural rights theory 自然权利理论, which came from many Enlightenment thinkers but most famously from John Locke 约翰·洛克 and his Second Treatise on Civil Government 《政府论（下篇）》. And you have to understand what a massive statement this is. Jefferson said that the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are given to people by their creator, and if you're paying attention, that means that the rights do not originate from 源自 the government or a king, which further means that these basic natural rights cannot be taken away by a government. In fact, the whole reason that people create governments is to watch over 守护 and protect their natural rights, which is exactly what Jefferson says next: "That to secure 保障 these rights, governments are instituted 建立 among men, deriving their just powers 正当权力 from the consent of the governed 被统治者的同意." +

So to protect natural rights, people create governments, and where does the government get its power from? The consent of the governed -- which is to say, from the people. Now all of that is a complimentary set of ideals 相辅相成的理念 from Rousseau 卢梭, namely popular sovereignty 人民主权 and the social contract 社会契约. Popular sovereignty means the power to govern 统治权 is in the people's hands, and then the social contract means that people willingly surrender 让渡 some of that power over to a government in order to protect their natural rights. +

Okay, so follow the logic here: people are born with natural rights that belong to them just by virtue of 由于 the fact that they were born a human being. Then in order to protect those rights from infringement 侵犯, the people create a government by their consent. And isn't that great? Everybody's rights are protected and it's just a big utopian 乌托邦式的 hugfest. Well no, not exactly. As it turns out 结果是, governments can be turds （俚语，糟糕的事物）, and they can break that social contract by infringing on 侵犯 the rights of its citizens. And so what happens in that case? Well, Jefferson's about to tell us: "That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends" -- in other words, doesn't hold up its end of the bargain 履行其职责 -- "it is the right of the people to alter 改变 or abolish 废除 it, and to institute 建立 a new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness." +

So what happens when the government turns out to be a tyrannical turd 专制的糟糕政权? You flush it （俚语，摆脱它）, and then in its place you build a new government which will uphold 维护 the purpose of protecting the natural rights of the people. And that is essentially what the colonists attempted after this document was published. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第一个基础文献，也就是《独立宣言》（Declaration of Independence）。你听说过它吗？我真心希望你的答案是肯定的，但即便你没听说过，看完这个视频后，关于这门课程中涉及到的《独立宣言》的知识，你都会了解到。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

好的，《独立宣言》基本上分为三个部分：一个序言，一系列对乔治三世（King George III）的不满，以及独立的决议。我们将主要关注序言部分，因为这门课程强调的是启蒙思想对这份文献撰写的影响，而序言中充满了启蒙思想。如果你不知道的话，撰写《独立宣言》的是托马斯·杰斐逊（Thomas Jefferson）。 +

所以，序言的第一部分是对美国殖民者与英国决裂原因的解释。杰斐逊写道：“在人类事务的进程中，当一个民族有必要解除与另一个民族的政治联系，并在地球上的权力中占据自然法则和上帝赋予他们的独立和平等地位时，为了尊重人类的意见，他们有必要宣布促使他们分离的原因。” 换句话说，如果你要和某人决裂，并且必须发动一场革命来实现这一点，那么合理的做法是试着解释你这样做的原因。 +

现在让我们停一下。为什么美国人不直接发动一场革命呢？为什么必须要撰写这份文献呢？嗯，这里的受众非常重要。我的意思是，杰斐逊本可以把这份文献封起来，直接装在信封里寄给乔治三世 —— 毕竟这些不满是针对他的。但这份文献并不是为了保密而写的。它在各殖民地以及西方世界广泛传播。所以这份文献有两个更广泛的目的：第一，动员国内的军队参战；第二，争取外国盟友的支持，这些盟友能够帮助美国人赢得这场从各方面来说他们本不该赢得的战争。 +

好的，在第一句话之后，启蒙思想真正开始体现：“我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的：人人生而平等，他们被造物主赋予某些不可剥夺的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利。” 就像我在关于这个主题的视频中提到的，这句话是自然权利理论的一个明显例子，自然权利理论源自许多启蒙思想家，其中最著名的是约翰·洛克（John Locke）和他的《政府论（下篇）》（Second Treatise on Civil Government）。你必须明白这是一个多么重大的声明。杰斐逊说生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利是造物主赋予人们的，如果你留意的话，这意味着这些权利并非源自政府或国王，这进一步意味着这些基本的自然权利不能被政府剥夺。事实上，人们创建政府的全部原因是为了守护和保护他们的自然权利，而这正是杰斐逊接下来所说的：“为了保障这些权利，人们在他们中间建立政府，而政府的正当权力，是经被治理者的同意而产生的。” +

所以，为了保护自然权利，人们创建了政府，那么政府的权力从何而来呢？来自被治理者的同意 —— 也就是说，来自人民。所有这些理念都与卢梭（Rousseau）的思想相契合，也就是人民主权（popular sovereignty）和社会契约（social contract）。人民主权意味着治理的权力掌握在人民手中，而社会契约意味着人们心甘情愿地把一部分权力让渡给政府，以便保护他们的自然权利。 +

好的，让我们顺着这个逻辑来：人人生而具有自然权利，这是他们作为人类与生俱来的。然后，为了保护这些权利不被侵犯，人们通过同意来创建政府。这不是很好吗？每个人的权利都得到了保护，就像一个美好的乌托邦。嗯，不完全是这样。事实证明，政府也可能很糟糕，它们可能会侵犯公民的权利，从而违背社会契约。那么在那种情况下会发生什么呢？嗯，杰斐逊即将告诉我们：“当任何形式的政府对这些目标具有破坏作用时” —— 换句话说，没有履行它应尽的义务 —— “人民就有权利改变它或废除它，并建立一个新的政府，新政府将建立在这样的原则之上，并以这样的形式组织权力，以最有可能保障他们的安全和幸福。” +

所以，当政府变成一个专制的糟糕政府时会发生什么呢？你抛弃它，然后在它的位置上建立一个新政府，这个新政府将维护保护人民自然权利的目的。而这基本上就是殖民者在这份文献发表后所尝试做的事情。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的关于美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中《独立宣言》的内容。点击这里查看一个播放列表，里面包含关于所有基础文献的视频，如果你想在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分，那么点击这里获取我的复习资料包。感谢观看。海姆勒，退出。 +
