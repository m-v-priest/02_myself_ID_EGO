Hey there, welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 4 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video it's time to talk about how political ideology 政治意识形态 shapes social policy 社会政策. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how political ideologies vary 变化 on the role of the government in addressing social issues 解决社会问题, and explain how different ideologies impact policy on social issues 影响社会问题相关政策. So in the last video, we talked about how liberals 自由派, conservatives 保守派, and libertarians 自由意志主义者 view the role of government with respect to 关于 the economy. Here we're going to shift 转换话题 and talk about how those same ideologies view social issues like marriage and family, poverty, abortion 堕胎, etc. +

Now here's where I tell you that when it comes to conservative and liberal ideologies and social issues, they defy easy, clean categories 难以简单归类. Let's start with libertarian ideology since they're probably the easiest to define. When it comes to social issues, recall 回想 that libertarians want as little government involvement on dang near 几乎 everything, which includes social issues. To a libertarian, the only thing the government is good for 有用的是 protecting private property 私有财产 and upholding individual liberty 维护个人自由. So legalization of marijuana 大麻合法化? Duh （俚语：显而易见） -- why would you want the government telling you what you can and cannot put in your body? Abortion? Get the government out of there. Education? Ain't nobody need the government for that. So when it comes to economic issues, libertarians lean more conservative 倾向于保守派, and in general with social issues -- especially regarding privacy 隐私 -- libertarians lean more liberal 倾向于自由派. +

Okay, let's move on to liberal ideology and social issues. Liberals tend to think that personal privacy 个人隐私 -- which is to say areas of behavior that should be excluded from government involvement 不应受政府干预的行为领域 -- is pretty broad 广泛的. So abortion, for example, is a private decision and should not be regulated by the government. So is the gender of the person you want to marry -- like if you're a man you want to marry another man, the government needs to stay out of it 不干涉. Legalize marijuana? No problem -- leave it to the individuals to decide 由个人决定. That might be a little confusing because if you've been watching my other videos on political ideology, the constant theme 一贯主题 has been that liberals favor government involvement 支持政府干预. They want the government to get involved with poverty, they want the government to get involved in education, they want the government to get involved in regulating businesses 监管企业. But on many social issues, liberals want the government out. +

Now with conservative ideology, there is a similar conundrum 难题. Conservatives want less government involvement on some social issues but more in others. Conservatives believe that abortion is not a private matter but should be regulated by the government. Conservatives believe that the government should mandate 规定 that marriage is an arrangement between one man and one woman. But when it comes to something like gun ownership 枪支所有权, conservatives want the government out of that decision. When it comes to education, conservatives want to make their own decisions about how and where to educate their children. With respect to 关于 religious beliefs 宗教信仰, conservatives want as little government intervention as possible 尽可能少的政府干预. So the point is, with liberals and conservatives, they favor government intervention in some social issues and reject it in others. And like I said, there isn't an easy way to categorize them neatly 简单归类. +

But just for poops and giggles （俚语：只是为了好玩）, let's have a look at three non-required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 that illustrate 说明 this tension 矛盾. The first is Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, and this was a case that considered the abortion ruling 堕胎裁决 handed down 宣布 in Roe v. Wade. In the 1980s, a Pennsylvania law added some significant restrictions to abortions -- like they mandated that any woman seeking an abortion had to wait for 24 hours before the procedure 手术, or if she was a minor 未成年人 she had to have the consent of 征得…同意 at least one parent, or if she was married she had to have the consent of her husband. Now to liberals -- for whom Roe v. Wade was a triumph for women's rights 女性权利的胜利 -- these strictures 限制措施 were unconscionable 不合理的. To conservatives, these restrictions were moving in the right direction to reduce the number of abortions performed. So with respect to government involvement, liberals were like "no" and conservatives were like "oh heck yes." Well, the court ended up upholding 维持 Roe v. Wade but simultaneously upholding almost all of Pennsylvania's restrictions. So I reckon 认为 you can say that there was a victory and a loss for both ideologies 意识形态. +

Another case illustrating the tension between conservative and liberal ideology in terms of social issues was Zelman v. Simmons-Harris in 2002, which was about education. In this case, students in underperforming schools 表现不佳的学校 in Cleveland, Ohio were offered vouchers 代金券 to attend whatever school they wanted. As it turns out 结果是, a giant portion of them used those vouchers to attend religious schools 宗教学校. Liberals saw this as a violation of 违反 the First Amendment's Establishment Clause 第一修正案确立条款 -- like they argued that the government should be involved in education but not in paying for religious education 宗教教育付费. Conservatives saw this move as upholding freedom of choice regarding education 维护教育选择权. Well, this one was a win for the conservatives. The court decided that since parents were sending their children to religious schools by choice 出于自愿 and not because they were mandated to 被强制要求, that such a system did not violate the Establishment Clause. +

And the final case illustrating this tension was Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, which addressed the right of gay couples to marry 同性伴侣结婚权. Conservatives believe that marriage and family is one of the chief cornerstones 主要基石 of society, and thus the government should prevent non-traditional marriages between people of the same sex 同性之间的非传统婚姻. Liberals believe that the government should have no say in 无权干涉 who a person marries, even if it's between two people of the same sex. Well, in this case, the court handed down a decision on the liberal side 做出有利于自由派的裁决 which made same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states 使同性婚姻在全美50个州合法化. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。目前我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第四单元，在这个视频中，我们要探讨政治意识形态是如何塑造社会政策的。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释政治意识形态在政府处理社会问题时所起的作用上有何不同，并解释不同的意识形态是如何影响社会问题方面的政策的。在上一个视频中，我们谈到了自由主义者（liberals）、保守主义者（conservatives）和自由意志主义者（libertarians）对政府在经济方面所起作用的看法。在这里，我们要转变一下，谈谈这些同样的意识形态对诸如婚姻和家庭、贫困、堕胎等社会问题的看法。 +

现在我要告诉你，当涉及到保守主义和自由主义意识形态以及社会问题时，它们并不容易被简单归类。我们先从自由意志主义意识形态开始，因为它们可能是最容易定义的。当涉及到社会问题时，请记住，自由意志主义者希望政府在几乎所有事情上的参与都尽可能少，这也包括社会问题。对自由意志主义者来说，政府唯一有用的地方是保护私有财产和维护个人自由。那么大麻合法化呢？这还用说嘛——你为什么会希望政府告诉你什么能放进身体、什么不能呢？堕胎呢？让政府别插手。教育呢？没人需要政府来管这个。所以当涉及到经济问题时，自由意志主义者更倾向于保守主义，而总体来说，在社会问题上——尤其是关于隐私方面——自由意志主义者更倾向于自由主义。 +

好的，让我们接着说自由主义意识形态和社会问题。自由主义者倾向于认为，个人隐私——也就是说那些应该不受政府干预的行为领域——范围相当广泛。比如，堕胎是个人决定，政府不应该进行监管。你想和什么性别的人结婚也是如此——比如，如果你是一个男人，你想和另一个男人结婚，政府就不应该干涉。大麻合法化？没问题——让个人来决定就好。这可能有点令人困惑，因为如果你看过我关于政治意识形态的其他视频，一直以来的主题都是自由主义者支持政府干预。他们希望政府参与解决贫困问题，希望政府参与教育，希望政府参与对企业的监管。但在许多社会问题上，自由主义者希望政府不要插手。 +

现在来说说保守主义意识形态，这里也存在类似的难题。保守主义者希望政府在一些社会问题上的参与减少，但在另一些问题上的参与增加。保守主义者认为，堕胎不是个人私事，政府应该进行监管。保守主义者认为，政府应该规定婚姻是一男一女之间的结合。但当涉及到像枪支所有权这样的事情时，保守主义者希望政府不要干涉这个决定。在教育方面，保守主义者希望自己决定如何以及在哪里教育他们的孩子。在宗教信仰方面，保守主义者希望政府的干预尽可能少。所以重点是，对于自由主义者和保守主义者来说，他们在一些社会问题上支持政府干预，而在另一些问题上则反对政府干预。就像我说的，没有简单的方法能把他们整齐地归类。 +

但只是为了找点乐子，我们来看三个非必修的最高法院（Supreme Court）案例，这些案例说明了这种矛盾。第一个是1992年的 “计划生育组织诉凯西案（Planned Parenthood v. Casey）”，这个案件重新考虑了 “罗伊诉韦德案（Roe v. Wade）” 中关于堕胎的裁决。在20世纪80年代，宾夕法尼亚州的一项法律对堕胎增加了一些重要限制——比如，他们规定任何寻求堕胎的女性在手术前必须等待24小时，或者如果她是未成年人，她必须得到至少一位家长的同意，或者如果她已婚，她必须得到丈夫的同意。对于那些认为 “罗伊诉韦德案” 是女性权利胜利的自由主义者来说，这些限制是不合理的。对于保守主义者来说，这些限制是朝着减少堕胎数量的正确方向前进。所以在政府干预方面，自由主义者说 “不”，而保守主义者说 “哦，当然要干预”。嗯，法院最终维持了 “罗伊诉韦德案” 的裁决，但同时也维持了宾夕法尼亚州的几乎所有限制。所以我认为可以说，对于这两种意识形态来说，都有胜利的地方，也都有失败的地方。 +

另一个说明了保守主义和自由主义意识形态在社会问题方面存在矛盾的案例是2002年的 “泽尔曼诉西蒙斯 - 哈里斯案（Zelman v. Simmons-Harris）”，这是关于教育的案件。在这个案件中，俄亥俄州克利夫兰市表现不佳学校的学生获得了代金券，可以去他们想去的任何学校上学。结果是，很大一部分学生用这些代金券去了宗教学校。自由主义者认为这违反了美国宪法第一修正案中的 “确立条款（Establishment Clause）”——他们认为政府应该参与教育，但不应该为宗教教育买单。保守主义者则认为这一举措维护了在教育方面的自由选择权。嗯，这个案件对保守主义者来说是一个胜利。法院裁定，因为家长是自愿把孩子送到宗教学校，而不是被强制的，所以这样的制度没有违反 “确立条款”。 +

最后一个说明了这种矛盾的案件是2015年的 “奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案（Obergefell v. Hodges）”，这个案件涉及同性恋伴侣的结婚权利。保守主义者认为婚姻和家庭是社会的主要基石之一，因此政府应该阻止同性之间的非传统婚姻。自由主义者认为，政府不应该对一个人选择和谁结婚指手画脚，即使是两个同性之间的婚姻。嗯，在这个案件中，法院做出了支持自由主义者的裁决，使同性婚姻在全美50个州合法化。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取复习资料包，这将帮助你在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这类视频，那就订阅来告诉我吧。你了解我的——我会照办的。海姆勒，退出。 +
