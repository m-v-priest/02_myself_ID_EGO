Well hey there and welcome back to Highlights History. Now we've been going through unit two of the AP government curriculum 课程, and in this video we're going to talk about presidential 总统的 communication 沟通；交流. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked bully pulpit 天字第一号讲坛；最高讲坛 style, well then let's get to it. +

So our objective 目标；目的 in this video is as follows: explain how communication technology has changed the president's relationship with the national constituency 选民；选区 and the other branches. Now there's one advantage 优势 that the president has that no other single politician 政治家 has, namely the unique 独特的 attention of the nation. If you stop 10 people on the street, it's likely that many of them would not be able to name their congressional representatives 国会议员 or even know their face if they pass them on the street. But everybody knows who the president is, and if they're keeping track of 追踪；记录 politics, they have their eye on 密切关注 the president. And that is a huge advantage for the executive branch 行政部门. +

Remember that among the informal powers 非正式权力 of the president is persuasion 说服；劝说. The president has a whole chunk 大量；一大块 of policies to be enacted 制定；颁布 but can't pass any of those laws on the president's own authority 职权, so therefore must rely on 依靠 congress to enact that legislation 立法 in line with 与…一致 the presidential policy agenda 政策议程. So how does the president get that done? Through persuasion. And the main way that happens is through the president's communication with the nation and the other branches of government. +

President Teddy Roosevelt called the presidency 总统职位 a bully pulpit. Let me just explain what that means because that could be confusing. A pulpit 讲坛；布道坛 of course is where a preacher 牧师 stands to communicate to a congregation 会众；聚集的人群. Bully in this sense isn't used the same way as we use it today -- like we think of the word bully as that kid who wants your lunch money or he's gonna punch you in the throat. But Roosevelt didn't mean bully in that way, as if the presidential communication was a coercive 强制的；胁迫的 means to get his will done. Bully in the old sense just means excellent 极好的. So by Roosevelt's reckoning 估计；判断, the office of president is a bully pulpit to get the policy agenda passed. And he's right. When the president speaks, the nation listens. And they may agree or disagree with that speech, but regardless 无论如何, they are listening. +

Now the only constitutionally 从宪法角度；依照宪法地 required communication from the president is a state of the union address 国情咨文, which is required "from time to time" in order to "recommend to congress's consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient 权宜的；有利的". George Washington delivered 发表 his state of the union addresses in person, but subsequent 随后的；后来的 presidents threw that precedent 先例 out until Woodrow Wilson took it back up in the early 20th century. So the state of the union address happens at the beginning of every year, and that's exactly what the president does -- he makes all kinds of policy recommendations 建议 to congress while the nation listens along. No other politician has that kind of platform 平台. +

Now presidential communication has changed over time as new technologies have emerged 出现. Washington's state of the union addresses, along with many presidents after him, were published in the newspapers. Additionally 此外, any speeches given by the president were necessarily filtered through 通过…过滤 newspaper journalists 记者. But over time, new technologies enabled 使能够 the president's bully pulpit to become even bullier. +

Probably the biggest leap forward 重大进步 in this respect was during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s. At that point, many Americans had radios in their homes and gathered around 聚集在…周围 them for entertainment and news. Roosevelt, elected as he was during the worst economic crisis 经济危机 in American history, sought to 试图 use this technology for his benefit 为了他的利益. He had made many promises about the mountain of legislation that he would enact in his first hundred days in office, but he knew that he needed the people on his side 支持他 to get it done quickly and efficiently 高效地. So he hosted what were known as fireside chats 炉边谈话 through the radio, in which he explained in common language 用通俗的语言 the outlines 大纲；概要 of the major proposals 提议 and what their impact 影响 would be on Americans. He discussed why he was enacting a bank holiday 银行休业日 and how that would fix the banking crisis 银行危机, and then he explained many of the different agencies 机构 and policies that were part of his New Deal program 新政计划. And you know what? That very much worked. The amount of legislation FDR was able to get passed in his first hundred days was staggering 令人震惊的, thanks in large part to 很大程度上归功于 the old bully pulpit. +

But then television came along, and that changed the nature 性质；本质 of the bully pulpit as well. Now not only could a president speak directly to the people audibly 可听地, but he could do it visually 视觉上地 as well. The interesting thing about television is that it made it necessary for the president to look good as well as sound good. For example, during the presidential debates 辩论 between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, people could either listen to them on the radio or watch them on television. And those who listened on the radio overwhelmingly 压倒性地 thought that Nixon had won the debates, but those who watched on television overwhelmingly thought that Kennedy had won the debate. Why? Because on television, Nixon was sweaty 出汗的 and not nearly as nice to look at as that young whippersnapper 傲慢的年轻人 on the other side. Anyway, Kennedy went on to win the presidency and began hosting televised press conferences 电视新闻发布会 to answer questions and to speak to the American people about his policy agenda. +

But even with the radio and television as bully pulpits for the president's communication, they were still media that were filtered through third-party journalists. But with the rise of 随着…的兴起 social media 社交媒体, the bully pulpit was again transformed 转变；改变 significantly 显著地. With sites like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, the president was able to speak directly to the American people without third party mediators 调解人；中间人. Additionally, the speed at which the president could comment publicly 公开评论 and respond to 回应 public issues was unprecedented 前所未有的. +

Now it was Barack Obama who mastered 精通；掌握 the use of social media in order to get elected 当选 and keep his constituency informed of 通知；告知 policy proposals. But it was his successor 继任者, Donald Trump, who got bullier on the social media bully pulpit than anyone before him. Twitter was his platform of choice 首选平台, and in the four years of his presidency, the man created more than 26,000 tweets 推文. In his first year, he averaged 平均 almost six tweets a day, but by year four, he averaged almost 35 tweets per day. And he used this bully pulpit to praise 赞扬 those loyal to 忠于 him, attack his political enemies, and urge 敦促 the American public to support his policy agenda. +

Now I said earlier that social media as a bully pulpit removed 消除；移除 the third party restrictions 限制 from the presidential communication, but that's not quite right. Even though presidents can now speak as frequently as they want through social media and mostly without any kind of filtering 过滤, Trump was able to find the limit of that late in his fourth year as president. Twitter banned 封禁 his account 账号 because they believed he played a direct role in inciting 煽动 an insurrection 暴动；叛乱 on the Capitol building 国会大厦 on January 6, 2021. And so his favorite bully pulpit was shutdown 关闭. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到《精彩历史》（Highlights History）。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第二单元，在这个视频中，我们将讨论总统的沟通方式。所以，如果你准备好以“最高讲坛”（bully pulpit）的风格来汲取知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

在这个视频中，我们的目标如下：解释沟通技术是如何改变总统与全国选民以及其他政府部门的关系的。总统有一个其他任何单个政治家都没有的优势，那就是能得到全国民众独特的关注。如果你在街上拦住十个人，很可能他们中的许多人无法说出他们的国会代表是谁，甚至当他们在街上遇到这些代表时也认不出来。但每个人都知道总统是谁，而且如果他们关注政治，他们就会留意总统。这对行政部门来说是一个巨大的优势。 +

要记住，总统的非正式权力之一是说服力。总统有一整套政策要实施，但仅凭总统自己的权力无法通过任何这些法律，因此必须依靠国会根据总统的政策议程来制定这些立法。那么总统是如何做到这一点的呢？通过说服。而实现这一点的主要方式是通过总统与全国以及其他政府部门的沟通。 +

泰迪·罗斯福（Teddy Roosevelt）总统称总统职位为“最高讲坛”（bully pulpit）。让我来解释一下这是什么意思，因为这可能会让人困惑。讲坛（pulpit）当然是传教士站在上面向会众讲话的地方。这里的“bully”和我们今天使用这个词的方式不一样——我们想到“bully”这个词，就会想到那个想要你午餐钱或者会揍你的孩子。但罗斯福并不是在那个意义上使用“bully”这个词，好像总统的沟通是一种强制手段来实现他的意愿。在旧的意义上，“bully”的意思是“极好的”。所以按照罗斯福的理解，总统职位是一个“最高讲坛”，用来通过政策议程。他说得没错。当总统讲话时，全国民众都会倾听。他们可能同意或不同意总统的演讲，但不管怎样，他们都会倾听。 +

现在，从宪法角度来看，总统唯一被要求进行的沟通是国情咨文（state of the union address），宪法要求总统“不时地”进行国情咨文，以便“向国会推荐他认为必要和适宜的措施”。乔治·华盛顿（George Washington）亲自发表国情咨文，但后来的总统们打破了这个先例，直到20世纪初伍德罗·威尔逊（Woodrow Wilson）又恢复了亲自发表国情咨文的做法。所以国情咨文在每年年初进行，总统在全国民众的倾听下向国会提出各种各样的政策建议。没有其他政治家拥有那样的平台。 +

随着新技术的出现，总统的沟通方式也随着时间发生了变化。华盛顿的国情咨文以及在他之后的许多总统的国情咨文都刊登在报纸上。此外，总统发表的任何演讲都必然要经过报纸记者的筛选。但随着时间的推移，新技术让总统的“最高讲坛”变得更具影响力。 +

在这方面，最大的进步可能是在20世纪30年代富兰克林·罗斯福（Franklin Roosevelt）担任总统期间。在那个时候，许多美国人家里都有收音机，他们围坐在收音机旁娱乐和获取新闻。罗斯福在当选时，美国正处于历史上最严重的经济危机中，他试图利用这项技术为自己服务。他做出了许多关于在他执政的头一百天里要颁布大量立法的承诺，但他知道他需要民众站在他这一边，以便快速有效地实现这些承诺。所以他通过收音机进行了所谓的“炉边谈话”（fireside chats），在谈话中，他用通俗易懂的语言解释了主要提案的概要以及这些提案对美国人的影响。他讨论了为什么他要颁布银行休业日，以及这将如何解决银行危机，然后他解释了作为他新政计划一部分的许多不同的机构和政策。你知道吗？这非常有效。富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福（FDR）在他执政的头一百天里能够通过的立法数量惊人，这在很大程度上要归功于这个“最高讲坛”。 +

但后来电视出现了，这也改变了“最高讲坛”的性质。现在总统不仅可以直接用声音与民众交流，还可以通过视觉方式进行交流。关于电视，有趣的是，它要求总统不仅要讲得好，还要看起来好。例如，在理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）和约翰·F·肯尼迪（John F. Kennedy）的总统辩论中，人们可以通过收音机收听辩论，也可以通过电视观看辩论。那些通过收音机收听辩论的人绝大多数认为尼克松赢得了辩论，但那些通过电视观看辩论的人绝大多数认为肯尼迪赢得了辩论。为什么呢？因为在电视上，尼克松满头大汗，而且远不如另一边那个年轻有为的人看起来好看。不管怎样，肯尼迪继续赢得了总统职位，并开始举办电视新闻发布会，回答问题，并向美国民众阐述他的政策议程。 +

但是，即使有收音机和电视作为总统沟通的“最高讲坛”，它们仍然是需要经过第三方记者筛选的媒体。但随着社交媒体的兴起，“最高讲坛”又发生了重大转变。有了像脸书（Facebook）、推特（Twitter）和优兔（YouTube）这样的网站，总统能够直接与美国民众交流，而无需第三方调解人。此外，总统能够公开评论并回应公共问题的速度是前所未有的。 +

现在，巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）掌握了利用社交媒体来当选并让他的选民了解政策提案的方法。但他的继任者唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）在社交媒体这个“最高讲坛”上比他之前的任何人都更具影响力。推特是他选择的平台，在他担任总统的四年里，他发布了超过26000条推文。在他执政的第一年，他平均每天发布近六条推文，但到了第四年，他平均每天发布近35条推文。他利用这个“最高讲坛”赞扬那些忠于他的人，攻击他的政治敌人，并敦促美国公众支持他的政策议程。 +

我之前说过，社交媒体作为“最高讲坛”消除了总统沟通中的第三方限制，但这并不完全正确。即使总统现在可以通过社交媒体随心所欲地频繁发言，而且大多无需任何筛选，但特朗普在他总统任期的第四年后期还是发现了这种方式的局限性。推特封禁了他的账号，因为他们认为他在2021年1月6日煽动对国会大厦的叛乱中起到了直接作用。所以他最喜欢的“最高讲坛”被关闭了。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程第二单元第七个主题的内容。如果你想在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分，点击这里获取你的复习资料包。容我自夸一下，这是一个非常棒的资料包。如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那么一定要订阅，我会照做的。海姆勒（Heimler）结束发言。 +
