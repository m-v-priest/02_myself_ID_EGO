Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at yet another one of your required 必修的 Supreme Court cases for the AP Government curriculum 教学大纲, namely McDonald v. Chicago. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked（幽默表达：开动脑筋）, then let's get to it. +

So just like in all of my required case videos, let's begin with the facts of the case 案件事实. The facts of this case actually begin with another case that had been decided in 2008, namely Heller v. the District of Columbia. In that case, the court ruled that the restrictive 限制性的 gun ownership laws in Washington D.C. were unconstitutional 违宪的. However, because D.C. is a federal district 联邦行政区, that ruling only applied to federal territory. So a man named Otis McDonald, along with a few other Chicago residents, decided to do what they could to apply this decision to the state 州政府. +

For McDonald's part, he was a grandfather whose street had been taken over by gangs 犯罪团伙, and his house had been robbed five times. As a hunter, he owned several rifles and shotguns legally, but argued that such large guns weren't practical for use in self-defense 自卫 in case of a midnight break-in. So he wanted to buy a handgun, but the problem was that Chicago arguably had the most restrictive handgun laws 手枪限制法律 in the nation, and so the constitutionality 合宪性 of those laws was brought before the Supreme Court. +

Okay, so what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake in this case? Well, this is pretty obviously a case about the Second Amendment 第二修正案, which protects a citizen's right to bear arms 携带武器. McDonald and the folks who filed with him argued that Chicago's restrictive gun laws infringed upon 侵犯 their right to own guns, especially after the ruling in the Heller case. However, the opposing side 反方 argued that restrictive gun laws were necessary to uphold public order and safety 公共秩序与安全. And remember, in cases like these, that's always the balance the court is trying to strike: do we uphold personal liberty 个人自由 at the expense of public order and safety, or vice versa? +

Well, to see which they chose, let's look at the decision the court handed down. The court ruled in favor of 支持 McDonald and the other petitioners 请愿人, arguing that Chicago's gun laws were indeed a violation 违反 of these citizens' Second Amendment rights. However, always keep in mind that although this is a case about the Second Amendment, it's not only a case about the Second Amendment. It's confusing? Well then let me explain it up real nice for you. +

Remember that the Second Amendment, along with the other nine amendments in the Bill of Rights 权利法案, only protects citizens from the federal government 联邦政府, not the state government 州政府. It was the passage of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案, with its Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款, that allowed the court to apply the Bill of Rights to state governments as well. And that's why the court can rule on a state law about guns. And it's very important that you understand the logic 合理性 of what happened as a result of this case. +

So follow me here as I consider why this case matters. Since the Heller case only applied to federal territory and not to the states, the McDonald decision applied that same ruling to the states 各州. This process is what's known as selective incorporation 选择性适用, which is the means by which the court applies the civil liberties 公民自由权利 found in the Bill of Rights to the states. And so the result of this decision was that any state or city that had similar restrictive gun laws had to rewrite 重新制定 their laws to fall in line with the McDonald ruling. +

And why? Well, because as Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion 多数意见书: "It is clear that the framers 制宪者 and ratifiers 批准者 of the 14th Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights 基本权利 necessary to our system of ordered liberty 有序自由." On the other hand, dissenting judges 持异议法官 argued that there was nothing in the history or logic of the Second Amendment that made gun ownership a fundamental right, but alas, their argument did not carry the day 占上风，胜出. +

Okay, I hope that helped. If you want even more help, then click right over here and grab a review packet 复习资料包, which is going to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. I've got videos on all the other required Supreme Court cases right here, so click away if that's something that you're into.

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个最高法院的必学案例，也就是 “麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案”（McDonald v. Chicago）。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

就像我所有关于必学案例的视频一样，我们先来看这个案件的事实。这个案件的事实实际上始于另一个在2008年判决的案件，也就是 “海勒诉哥伦比亚特区案”（Heller v. the District of Columbia）。在那个案件中，法院裁定华盛顿特区（Washington D.C.）限制枪支所有权的法律是违宪的。然而，因为哥伦比亚特区是一个联邦特区，那个裁决只适用于联邦领地。所以一个叫奥蒂斯·麦克唐纳（Otis McDonald）的人，和其他几个芝加哥（Chicago）居民，决定尽他们所能让这个裁决适用于州。 +

就麦克唐纳而言，他是一位祖父，他所在的街道被帮派控制，他的房子被抢劫了五次。作为一个猎人，他合法拥有几把步枪和猎枪，但他认为，在半夜有人闯入的情况下，这么大的枪在自卫时并不实用。所以他想买一把手枪，但问题是，芝加哥可以说是全国枪支法律限制最严格的地方，所以这些法律的合宪性问题被提交到最高法院。 +

好的，那么这个案件所涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？嗯，很明显，这是一个关于第二修正案（Second Amendment）保护公民持枪权的案件。麦克唐纳和与他一起提起诉讼的人认为，芝加哥的限制性枪支法律侵犯了他们拥有枪支的权利，特别是在 “海勒案” 的裁决之后。然而，对方认为，限制性枪支法律对于维护公共秩序和安全是必要的。记住，在这样的案件中，法院总是试图在个人自由和公共秩序与安全之间取得平衡：我们是以牺牲公共秩序和安全为代价来维护个人自由，还是反之呢？ +

那么，要知道他们选择了哪一方，我们来看看法院的裁决。法院做出了有利于麦克唐纳和其他请愿者的裁决，认为芝加哥的枪支法律确实侵犯了这些公民的第二修正案权利。然而，要始终记住，虽然这是一个关于第二修正案的案件，但它不只是一个关于第二修正案的案件。这很让人困惑吗？那么让我好好给你解释一下。 +

记住，第二修正案和《权利法案》（Bill of Rights）中的其他九条修正案一样，只保护公民免受联邦政府的侵害，而不是州政府。是第十四修正案（14th Amendment）及其平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）使得法院能够将《权利法案》应用到州政府。这就是为什么法院能够对州的枪支法律进行裁决。理解这个案件所产生的逻辑是非常重要的。 +

所以跟着我来分析这个案件为什么重要。因为 “海勒案” 只适用于联邦领地而不适用于各州，“麦克唐纳案” 的裁决将同样的裁决应用到各州。这个过程被称为选择性合并（selective incorporation），也就是法院将《权利法案》中的公民自由权利应用到各州的方式。所以这个裁决的结果是，任何有类似限制性枪支法律的州或城市都必须重写他们的法律，以符合 “麦克唐纳案” 的裁决。 +

为什么呢？嗯，正如塞缪尔·阿利托（Samuel Alito）大法官在多数意见中所写的：“很明显，第十四修正案的制定者和批准者将持有和携带武器的权利视为我们有序自由体系所必需的基本权利之一。” 另一方面，持异议的法官认为，从第二修正案的历史或逻辑来看，没有任何内容能使拥有枪支成为一项基本权利，但是，唉，他们的论点没有占上风。 +

好的，我希望这对你有帮助。如果你想要更多帮助，那么点击这里获取复习资料包，这将帮助你在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分。我这里还有关于所有其他最高法院必学案例的视频，所以如果你对此感兴趣，就点击观看吧。如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，我肯定会照做的。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +
