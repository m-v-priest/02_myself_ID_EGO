So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a court-appointed lawyer 法院指定的律师, then let's get to it. +  

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. In 1961, Clarence Earl Gideon broke into a pool hall 台球厅 in Florida, smashed up 打碎 a cigarette machine to remove coins from it, and stole some cash from the register 收银机. He was summarily 立即地 arrested and sent to trial 受审. Now our boy Gideon was no stranger to standing trial for crimes 在法庭受审 -- in other states he had done so on several occasions, and because he was poor, the courts appointed 指派 a lawyer to represent 代理 him at no charge 免费. However, in Florida, the law said that the state will only appoint a lawyer to a defendant 被告 in capital cases 死刑案件, and thus Gideon was not entitled to 有权获得 representation appointed by the state. So Gideon acted as his own lawyer 自行辩护, and wouldn't you know it, he was convicted 定罪. He appealed 上诉, and eventually his case was brought before the Supreme Court. +  

So once it arrived at the court, what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中? Well, this was a case based on the Sixth Amendment 第六修正案, which says: "In all criminal prosecutions 刑事诉讼, the accused 被告人 shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel 律师 for his defense." Now remember, the Sixth Amendment as written only applies to 适用于 the federal government, so in this case a state government was denying 拒绝给予 Gideon a lawyer to represent him, and therefore technically speaking 从技术层面讲 the Sixth Amendment was not being violated because he was not standing trial in a federal court. However, the 14th Amendment's 第十四修正案 Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款 applies the liberties 自由 contained in the Bill of Rights 权利法案 to the states, and so that's what this case is about: does the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment require states to appoint a lawyer to someone who cannot afford it? +  

But don't get confused here. If you see a question about this case and it asks you about the constitutional principle at stake, it's the Sixth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment part is just asking you whether the Sixth Amendment can be applied to the state. So let's see if it does by looking at the decision handed down by the court. +  

Well, the court ruled unanimously 一致地 in Gideon's favor, arguing that yes, the Sixth Amendment's provision 规定 for a lawyer does apply to the states via 通过 the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. And in the unanimous opinion 一致意见 authored 撰写 by Justice Hugo Black, the argument went like this: "The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed 被视为 fundamental and essential 基本且必要的 to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on 高度重视 procedural 程序上的 and substantive 实质上的 safeguards 保障措施 designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals 公正的法庭 in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal 崇高理想 cannot be realized if the poor man charged with a crime has to face his accusers 原告 without a lawyer to assist him." +  

Okay, so let's finish by talking about why this case matters. This case matters first of all because through it the Sixth Amendment was incorporated 纳入 to the states. Remember, the process of selective incorporation 选择性纳入 is how the court systematically 系统地 applies the liberties and protections of the Bill of Rights to state governments. Second, in the wake of 由于 this decision, states were required to fund and train thousands of public defense lawyers 公设辩护律师 who could be called upon to defend clients who are not able to afford their lawyers. And that public defense system has continued to grow until today, which means that if you break into a pool hall and smash up a cigarette machine, you will certainly have someone to defend you. But you know, even better than that would be just don't do it. You know, stay in school. You know, that's it. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即1963年的“吉迪恩诉温赖特案（Gideon v. Wainwright）”。所以，如果你准备好以“法院指定律师”的主题激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

一如既往，我们先从案件事实讲起。1961年，克拉伦斯·厄尔·吉迪恩（Clarence Earl Gideon）闯入佛罗里达州（Florida）的一家台球厅，砸开一台香烟机偷取硬币，并从收银机里偷走了一些现金。他随即被捕并接受审判。我们的吉迪恩老兄对因犯罪受审并不陌生——他曾在其他州多次面临审判，由于他家境贫寒，法院会免费为他指定律师。然而，佛罗里达州的法律规定，该州仅在死刑案件中为被告指定律师，因此吉迪恩无权获得州政府指定的代理律师。于是，吉迪恩只能自行辩护，不出所料，他被判有罪。他提出上诉，最终案件被提交至最高法院。 +  

案件到达最高法院后，涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？这是一个基于宪法第六修正案（Sixth Amendment）的案件，该修正案规定：“在所有刑事诉讼中，被告人有权获得律师协助为其辩护。” 请记住，第六修正案本身仅适用于联邦政府，因此在本案中，州政府拒绝为吉迪恩提供律师，从技术层面讲并未违反第六修正案，因为他并非在联邦法院受审。然而，第十四修正案（14th Amendment）的平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）将《权利法案》（Bill of Rights）中的自由权适用于各州，因此本案的核心问题是：第十四修正案的平等保护条款是否要求各州为无力聘请律师的人指定律师？ +  

但在此处不要混淆。如果看到关于本案的问题并询问涉及的宪法原则，答案是第六修正案。第十四修正案的部分只是询问第六修正案是否可适用于各州。那么，我们通过最高法院的判决来看看是否适用。 +  

最高法院一致作出了有利于吉迪恩的裁决，认为第六修正案关于律师的规定确实通过第十四修正案的平等保护条款适用于各州。在雨果·布莱克（Hugo Black）大法官撰写的一致意见中，论点如下：“在某些国家，被指控犯罪者获得律师协助的权利可能不被视为公正审判的基本和必要条件，但在我们国家却是如此。从一开始，我们的州和国家宪法及法律就高度重视程序和实体保障措施，旨在确保在公正的法庭进行公平审判，使每位被告在法律面前平等。如果被指控犯罪的穷人不得不面对原告却没有律师协助，这一崇高理想便无法实现。” +  

最后，我们来谈谈这个案件为何重要。首先，通过本案，第六修正案被纳入适用于各州的范畴。记住，“选择性纳入（selective incorporation）”程序是法院将《权利法案》的自由和保护系统性地适用于州政府的方式。其次，在此裁决之后，各州被要求资助和培训数千名公设辩护律师，以代表无力聘请律师的当事人。这一公设辩护体系持续发展至今，这意味着如果你闯入台球厅并砸毁香烟机，肯定会有人为你辩护。但话说回来，比这更好的做法显然是不要这么做。你知道的，好好上学吧，就这样。 +
