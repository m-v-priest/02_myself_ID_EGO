Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 4 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video that means it's time to talk about the effects of public opinion 公众舆论 on elections 选举 and policy debates 政策辩论. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Okay, as always, let's start with our learning objective 学习目标: explain the quality and credibility 质量和可信度 of claims based on public opinion data 基于公众舆论数据的主张. So if you were here for the previous video, we talked about how researchers use mass surveys 大规模调查 and other means 其他方式 to measure public opinion on a wide variety of issues 各种各样的问题. But they don't just do that for funsies 为了好玩 -- they do it because public opinion affects elections and the outcomes of policy debates. Based on public opinion, legislators 立法者 know how much support they have for certain pieces of legislation 立法议案. Based on public opinion, candidates for office 公职候选人 know how to appeal to 吸引 people's actual desires 实际愿望. +

But aside from 除了 those higher level effects, public opinion polls 民意调查 have very real consequences 实际影响. Maybe you've seen a presidential primary debate 总统初选辩论 before -- this is where all the candidates for that party are contending to 争夺 get the nomination 提名 to run for president. Now for the 2016 Republican primaries 共和党初选, there was roughly a metric butt load of 大量的 contenders 竞争者 for the nomination, and if you watch that debate you may have wondered: how do they decide where to place each candidate on the stage? I mean, okay, you probably weren't wondering that, but whatever -- they did place these people on the stage according to their polling numbers 民调数据. So the candidate with the highest numbers will be placed at the center, and then they fan out 呈扇形展开 from there. +

Now why does that matter? Well, it matters because the candidate in the center will draw more attention 吸引更多关注, and the people who study these things tell us that the center-placed candidates usually have more speaking time 发言时间 than the rest. And all of that is a result of how they fared 表现 in public opinion polls. So you can start to see the power of the system: like if a candidate is popular in opinion polls, then that same candidate will be front and center 处于重要位置 in the primary debate, which means more attention and hopefully more positive opinions made to the public. And this can have a self-perpetuating effect 自我延续的效果. +

In fact, because of what's called the bandwagon effect 从众效应, people are more likely to get behind 支持 a candidate who is polling well 民调表现好 because, at the end of the day 归根结底, people don't want to back a loser -- they want to back a winner. Additionally, candidates who have higher polling numbers have an easier time raising funds 筹集资金 because, again, if you're polling well you're more likely to win, and nobody wants to give money to a losing candidate. So you can see that public opinion polls can have a powerful effect on the outcome of an election 选举结果. +

But in addition to 除了 elections, public opinions can have a strong effect on policy debate 政策辩论 as well. Like if polls indicate 表明 that a majority of Americans favor 支持 a given policy, then politicians are more likely than not to 很可能 vote for it. On the other side of the coin 另一方面, if a policy is popular and a politician votes against it, they are going to pay for it 为此付出代价. Now I confess that recently that has not been as much the case -- like for example, as the Republican party 共和党 has consistently tried to block 阻挠 very popular legislation 立法 embodied in 体现在 President Biden's infrastructure package 拜登总统的基础设施建设法案, they don't actually appear to be suffering any political disadvantage 政治劣势 for doing this. But even so, in general what I said is usually how it works. +

Now what I've said so far is this: public opinion polls have a significant influence over 对…有重大影响 elections and policy debates. And in a perfect world, that is how it works. However, as is my custom 按照我的习惯, I need to complicate this a little. The relationship between public opinion polls and elections and policy debates can be affected by how people view the reliability 可靠性 of those opinion polls. +

If you remember in the last video, we talked about the principles of scientific polls 科学民意调查的原则 and how if polls are conducted correctly according to scientific rigor 科学严谨性, then they are about the best tools we have for accurately measuring public opinion. However, that reliability has come into question 受到质疑 recently, not least because 尤其是因为 there have been a few spectacular blunders 严重失误 with polls. Probably the most recent and notable polling failure 民调失误 occurred in the 2016 presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. +

According to the pollsters 民意调查机构, Clinton was a shoo-in 稳操胜券的人 for victory. In fact, I could still remember going to bed about 10 o'clock that night convinced that I would wake up to a Clinton presidency because that's what all the polls were showing. And they were good polls -- like no reason to doubt them. But instead I woke up with everyone else to this shocking news: the pollsters were wrong. Trump had won, and not Clinton. Now as the numbers were added up, Clinton did have a healthy winning margin 较大的领先优势 on the popular vote 普选票, but Trump won the electoral college vote 选举人票, which is you know all that matters, so that can't be the explanation. So what happened? +

Well, researchers tried to figure out 弄清楚 what went wrong, and they came up with 提出 a list of potential explanations 可能的解释, and I'm only going to give you two. First, they considered what's called the social desirability bias 社会期望偏差, and this is when people are filling out surveys 填写调查问卷 and they give a socially desirable answer 符合社会期望的答案 even if they don't follow through with it 即使他们不会付诸行动. In other words, when a pollster asks a person for which candidate they're likely to vote, it would not be socially acceptable 社会可接受的 to say "I am not voting." As Americans, we see voting as kind of like a sacred responsibility 神圣的责任, and so it could be that a lot of people who said they were going to vote didn't actually vote. +

Another potential explanation is the non-response bias 无回应偏差, which says that certain groups are more likely to respond to public opinion polls than others. Think about it this way: if someone is standing with a clipboard 写字板 in a mall and asks me for a few minutes of my time to respond to a survey, I always tell them no. Like I've got other things to do -- I don't want to stop. Don't judge me -- that's just how I am. But there are other kinds of people who feel really uncomfortable telling a person no for whatever reason, so even if they don't want to stop and respond to the survey, they're going to do it just because they don't want to endure 忍受 the uncomfortable social interaction 社交互动 that is required to tell that person no. +

So think about it: at the end of the day, that person conducting the survey 进行调查的人 is only going to have data from people who said yes, and precisely 恰恰 no data from people like me who are fine saying no. Now it's a very simple example, and scientific polling has methods to adjust for 调整 that kind of bias, but that was a potential explanation for the polling failure of 2016. Pollsters speculated 推测 that since Trump frequently spouted 发表 strong words against establishment media 主流媒体, his supporters were perhaps less likely to respond to polls, and that could account for 解释 the inaccuracy 不准确 of the data. +

Regardless 无论如何, that major polling failure led to widespread criticism of 引发广泛批评 public opinion data 公众舆论数据. The last thing I should say is that non-scientific polls 非科学民意调查 can affect the relationship between polling data 民调数据 and elections as well. Polls can be funded by partisan groups 党派团体 or partisan news outlets 党派新闻媒体, and they are designed to show support for their own favored interests 支持他们青睐的利益. And I shouldn't even have to say this, but I will: these are not reliable polls 可靠的民意调查. Like if you see a partisan news outlet showing public opinion polls that heavily favor a policy that is in line with 与…一致 their particular partisan affiliation 党派归属, take it with a grain of salt 持怀疑态度 -- nay 不, take it with a metric butt load of salt -- because those polls are in no way a reliable measure of public opinion. +

But unfortunately, many Americans don't know the difference between these kinds of polls and the scientifically rigorous polls 科学严谨的民意调查, and thus lump them all together 把它们混为一谈, further degrading 进一步降低 the public's trust in polling numbers 公众对民调数据的信任. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第四单元，在这个视频中，意味着是时候讨论公众舆论对选举和政策辩论的影响了。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

好的，和往常一样，我们从学习目标开始：解释基于公众舆论数据的主张的质量和可信度。所以，如果你看过之前的视频，我们讨论了研究人员如何使用大规模调查和其他手段来衡量公众对各种问题的看法。但他们这么做可不只是为了好玩——他们这么做是因为公众舆论会影响选举和政策辩论的结果。基于公众舆论，立法者知道他们的某些立法获得了多少支持。基于公众舆论，公职候选人知道如何迎合人们的实际需求。 +

但除了这些高层次的影响之外，公众舆论调查有着非常实际的后果。也许你之前看过总统初选辩论——在这种辩论中，该政党的所有候选人都在竞争总统提名。在2016年的共和党初选中，有相当多的候选人竞争提名，如果你看了那场辩论，你可能会想：他们如何决定每个候选人在舞台上的位置呢？我的意思是，好吧，你可能不会想这个问题，但不管怎样——他们确实是根据候选人的民调数字来安排他们在舞台上的位置的。所以民调数字最高的候选人会被安排在舞台中央，然后其他候选人从中央向外排列。 +

那么这为什么重要呢？嗯，这很重要，因为站在舞台中央的候选人会吸引更多的关注，而且研究这些事情的人告诉我们，处于中央位置的候选人通常比其他人有更多的发言时间。而这一切都是他们在公众舆论调查中表现的结果。所以你可以开始看到这个体系的力量：比如，如果一个候选人在民意调查中很受欢迎，那么这个候选人就会在初选辩论中处于前沿和中心位置，这意味着会吸引更多的关注，并且有望让公众产生更多积极的看法。而这会产生一种自我延续的效果。 +

事实上，由于所谓的从众效应，人们更有可能支持在民意调查中表现良好的候选人，因为归根结底，人们不想支持失败者——他们想支持获胜者。此外，民调数字较高的候选人更容易筹集资金，因为同样地，如果你在民调中表现良好，你就更有可能获胜，而且没有人想把钱给一个会失败的候选人。所以你可以看到，公众舆论调查对选举结果有着强大的影响。 +

但除了选举之外，公众舆论对政策辩论也有很强的影响。比如，如果民意调查表明大多数美国人支持某项政策，那么政治家们很可能会投票支持它。另一方面，如果一项政策很受欢迎，而一个政治家投票反对它，他们将为此付出代价。我承认，最近情况并非总是如此——例如，共和党一直试图阻止拜登总统基础设施方案中非常受欢迎的立法，但他们这样做实际上似乎并没有遭受任何政治上的不利影响。但即便如此，一般来说，我刚才所说的情况就是这样运作的。 +

到目前为止我所说的是：公众舆论调查对选举和政策辩论有着重大影响。在一个完美的世界里，事情就是这样运作的。然而，按照我的习惯，我需要让这个情况更复杂一些。公众舆论调查与选举和政策辩论之间的关系会受到人们对这些民意调查可靠性看法的影响。 +

如果你还记得上一个视频，我们讨论了科学民意调查的原则，以及如果民意调查按照科学严谨性正确进行，那么它们就是我们准确衡量公众舆论的最佳工具。然而，这种可靠性最近受到了质疑，部分原因是民意调查中出现了一些严重的失误。可能最近最显著的民意调查失误发生在2016年唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）和希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）的总统选举中。 +

根据民意调查者的预测，希拉里·克林顿稳操胜券。事实上，我还记得那天晚上10点左右我上床睡觉，深信当我醒来时将迎来克林顿执政，因为所有的民意调查都是这么显示的。而且这些民意调查看起来很可靠——没有理由怀疑它们。但当我和其他人一样醒来时，却听到了令人震惊的消息：民意调查者错了。获胜的是特朗普，而不是克林顿。现在，当统计选票时，克林顿在普选中确实有不错的领先优势，但特朗普赢得了选举人团的选票，而这才是关键，所以这不能解释发生了什么。那么到底是怎么回事呢？ +

嗯，研究人员试图找出问题所在，他们列出了一些可能的解释，我只给你们说两个。首先，他们考虑了所谓的社会期望偏差，也就是说，当人们填写调查问卷时，即使他们不会真正这么做，他们也会给出符合社会期望的答案。换句话说，当民意调查者询问一个人他们可能会投票给哪个候选人时，说 “我不会投票” 在社会上是不被接受的。作为美国人，我们把投票看作是一种神圣的责任，所以可能很多说自己会投票的人实际上并没有投票。 +

另一个可能的解释是非回应偏差，也就是说某些群体比其他群体更有可能回应公众舆论调查。这样想：如果有人拿着写字板在商场里拦住我，让我花几分钟时间回答一个调查，我总是会拒绝。就像我还有其他事情要做——我不想停下来。别评判我——我就是这样的人。但也有其他一些人，不管出于什么原因，他们觉得拒绝别人会很不舒服，所以即使他们不想停下来回答调查，他们也会这么做，只是因为他们不想忍受拒绝别人所带来的不舒服的社交互动。 +

所以想想看：最终，进行调查的人只能得到那些说 “是” 的人的数据，而像我这样会直接拒绝的人的数据则完全没有。这是一个非常简单的例子，科学的民意调查有方法来调整这种偏差，但这是对2016年民意调查失败的一个可能的解释。民意调查者推测，由于特朗普经常强烈抨击主流媒体，他的支持者可能不太愿意回应民意调查，这可能就是数据不准确的原因。 +

不管怎样，那次重大的民意调查失败引发了对公众舆论数据的广泛批评。我要说的最后一点是，不科学的民意调查也会影响民意调查数据与选举之间的关系。民意调查可能由党派团体或党派新闻媒体资助，而且这些调查是为了显示对他们所支持的利益的支持。我甚至都不用多说，但我还是要说：这些不是可靠的民意调查。比如，如果你看到一个党派新闻媒体公布的民意调查强烈支持一项与其特定党派立场一致的政策，要持保留态度——不，要非常谨慎地看待——因为这些民意调查绝不是衡量公众舆论的可靠方式。 +

但不幸的是，许多美国人不知道这类民意调查和科学严谨的民意调查之间的区别，因此将它们混为一谈，进一步降低了公众对民意调查数字的信任。 +
