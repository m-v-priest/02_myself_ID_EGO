And hey, that's fine, right? You all do y'all? +  

Well no. Wisconsin actually had a compulsory education law 义务教育法 which mandated 强制规定 that children be educated up to 16 years old at a minimum.

Is the state right to make laws for the education of its children? Yes. Are the Amish families in this case right to want the government out of their religious practices? Of course.

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即“威斯康星州诉约德案（Wisconsin v. Yoder）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

一如既往，我们先从案件事实讲起。在本案发生之前，威斯康星州（Wisconsin）的三个阿米什（Amish）家庭在孩子读完八年级后将他们从公立学校接出。按照阿米什人的观念，八年级之后就不再需要州政府规定的学校教育了，孩子们通过与家人一起进行职业培训，在那些年里能学到更多东西。此外，这些家庭深切担忧孩子在高中会接触到世俗观念的影响，而这些观念最终与他们的宗教信仰相悖。嘿，这没问题，对吧？你们都懂了吗？ +  

但事实并非如此。威斯康星州实际上有一项义务教育法，规定儿童至少要接受教育至16岁。由于这些孩子还未满16岁，他们的父母违反了法律，因此每人被处以高达五美元的罚款。案件进入司法程序后，除州最高法院外，各级法院均支持州政府的立场。但最终在1972年，案件提交至联邦最高法院。 +  

这里涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？乔纳斯·约德（Jonas Yoder）及他所代表的其他家长辩称，威斯康星州的义务教育法侵犯了他们依据宪法第一修正案（First Amendment）享有的宗教自由实践权利。但威斯康星州反驳称，州政府在教育本州儿童方面拥有“迫切利益（compelling interest）”，且该利益优先于阿米什社区的宗教自由实践权利。 +  

如果你观看过第三单元主题3的视频，就会记得最高法院总是试图在社会秩序与个人自由之间取得平衡，而本案正是这一原则的绝佳例证。州政府是否有权为教育本州儿童制定法律？是的。本案中的阿米什家庭是否有权要求政府不干预其宗教实践？当然。那么，这两者中哪一个对最高法院更具说服力呢？ +  

为此，我们来看案件的判决结果。最高法院以全票裁决支持约德一方，认为州政府在儿童教育方面的利益不应凌驾于阿米什家庭自由实践宗教的权利之上。因此，本案被认定为侵犯了阿米什家庭的第一修正案权利，法院承认，强迫阿米什人将孩子再送入学堂两年，将对他们的生活方式构成切实威胁。 +  

首席大法官沃伦·伯格（Warren Burger）在多数意见中指出：“无论州政府在普及义务教育方面的利益多么强烈，它绝不是绝对的，不能排除或贬抑所有其他利益。” +  

那么，这个案件为何重要呢？它之所以重要，是因为它为未来涉及州政府利益与宗教自由实践冲突的案件奠定了基调。此外，本案之后，“在家教育（homeschool）”运动获得了巨大推动。所以，如果你是穿着睡衣在家学习的人之一，那你可以去拥抱一位阿米什人了。 +
