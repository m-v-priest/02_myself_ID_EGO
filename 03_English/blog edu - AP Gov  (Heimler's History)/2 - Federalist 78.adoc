Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at another one of your required documents 必备文档 for AP Government, namely Federalist 78. So if you're ready to give me a lifetime appointment 终身任命 to milk your brain cows, then let's get to it. +

Now, the Federalist Papers 联邦党人文集 were of course written to argue for the ratification 批准 of the newly drafted 起草的 Constitution 宪法, and Federalist 78, written by our boy Alexander Hamilton, is all about the judicial branch 司法部门 of the new federal government 联邦政府 outlined 概述 in the Constitution. +

Now, he begins by acknowledging 承认 that since there was no federal court system 联邦法院系统 under the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例 -- which was patently 显然地 a hot mess 一团糟 -- nobody really disagreed that America needed this new judicial institution 司法机构. The only real argument is over how and for how long justices 法官 will be appointed, and what kind of power the judicial branch should have. +

So let's start with how judges will be appointed to the federal courts and for how long. So federal judges 联邦法官 are appointed by the president according to Article 3 of the Constitution. And as to the length of their term 任期, Hamilton says, "According to the plan of the convention 制宪会议, all judges who may be appointed to the United States are to hold their offices during good behavior." So that means as long as federal judges behave, they will hold their offices for life 终身任职. +

Now, that seemed awfully suspect 可疑的 to Anti-Federalists 反联邦党人 who are arguing against the ratification of the Constitution. "So you're saying that the people don't elect these judges, and the people can't replace these judges in elections because they have life tenure 终身任期? I say!" +

But Hamilton argued that lifetime appointments 终身任命 were a necessity 必要 to keep this branch of government as independent 独立的 as possible. He says, "If then the courts of justice 法院 are to be considered as the bulwarks 堡垒 of a limited constitution 有限宪法 against legislative encroachments 立法侵犯, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure 永久任期 of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit 独立精神 in the judges which must be essential 必不可少的 to the faithful performance 忠实履行 of so arduous 艰巨的 a duty." +

Do you remember Madison's argument from Federalist 51 that in order for this new government to work, each of the three branches 三个部门 had to operate as independently as possible? That's essentially 本质上 what Hamilton is arguing here for the judicial branch. Lifetime appointments make it possible for judges to rule with impartiality 公正 and not have to worry about pleasing the people for the sake of re-election 连任. +

Additionally 此外, lifetime appointments serve a practical function 实际功能 as well. Hamilton says, think about the whole mountain of precedents 先例 that a federal judge will be responsible for knowing. If you change judges out at any span of time, the amount of learning that must be done will make the office itself prohibitive 难以承担的. And that's a problem because, "a temporary duration 临时任期 in office which would naturally discourage 使气馁 such characters from quitting a lucrative 赚钱的 line of law practice 法律业务 to accept a seat on the bench 法官席位 would have the tendency to throw the administration of justice 司法行政 into hands less able and less well qualified 有资格的 to conduct it with utility 效用 and dignity 尊严." +

So that's why, according to Hamilton, lifetime appointments are necessary for the judiciary 司法系统. He then goes on to talk about the scope 范围 and limits of power of the judicial branch. The duty of federal judges, he says, must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest 明显的 tenor 要旨 of the constitution void 无效的. The word for this power of the judicial branch is judicial review 司法审查. The court is responsible for considering laws passed by Congress 国会 and making sure that they are in line with 符合 the Constitution. If the court finds that they are not and rules in such a manner, then the offending laws 违宪法案 are considered null and void 无效. +

Now, Hamilton's detractors 批评者 argued that such power would make the judicial branch more powerful than the legislative branch 立法部门 which represented the people. And that's what it sounds like, right? Like if the federal courts can overturn 推翻 a law passed by the legislature 立法机构, then it sounds like the judiciary 司法机构 has more power. But Hamilton disagrees: "There is no position which depends on clearer principles than that every act of a delegated authority 授权行为 contrary to the tenor of the commission 授权 under which it is exercised is void. No legislative act therefore contrary to the constitution can be valid 有效的." In other words 换句话说, if the legislature passes a law which violates 违反 the constitution, it is already null and void because no unconstitutional law can be binding 有约束力的 on a people governed by the constitution. +

In that way, the courts were designed to be an intermediate body 中间机构 between the people and the legislature, "in order among other things to keep the legislature within the limits assigned to their authority." And then he goes on to explain why the scenario 情况 does not give the judicial branch undue power 不当权力: "Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority 优越性 of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both, and that where the will of the legislature declared in statute 法规 stands in opposition to 与…对立 that of the people declared in the constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter 后者 rather than the former 前者." +

So to summarize 总结: lifetime appointments for federal judges are necessary to keep them independent and unreliant on 不依赖 popular will 民意, and the judicial branch's power of judicial review does not make the federal court system more powerful than the legislature, but rather balances and checks 制衡 it. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们将看看美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的另一份必学文件，即《联邦党人文集》第78篇（Federalist 78）。所以，如果你准备好让我“任职终身”来挖掘你的知识储备，那么我们开始吧。 +

《联邦党人文集》当然是为了支持新起草的宪法获得批准而撰写的，而由我们的朋友亚历山大·汉密尔顿（Alexander Hamilton）撰写的《联邦党人文集》第78篇，主要是关于宪法中所概述的新联邦政府的司法分支。 +

汉密尔顿一开始就承认，由于在《邦联条例》（Articles of Confederation）下没有联邦法院系统——而《邦联条例》显然是一团糟——大家都认同美国需要这个新的司法机构。唯一真正的争议在于法官的任命方式、任期时长，以及司法分支应该拥有什么样的权力。 +

那么，让我们从联邦法院法官的任命方式以及任期时长开始说起。根据宪法第三条，联邦法官由总统任命。至于他们的任期时长，汉密尔顿说：“根据制宪会议的方案，所有被任命到美国法院的法官，只要行为良好，就可以任职。” 这意味着，只要联邦法官行为得当，他们就可以终身任职。 +

对于那些反对批准宪法的反联邦党人（Anti-Federalists）来说，这似乎非常可疑。“所以你是说，这些法官不由人民选举产生，而且人民在选举中也不能替换这些法官，因为他们是终身任职的？真有你的！” +

但汉密尔顿认为，终身任命对于使政府的这个分支尽可能独立来说是必要的。他说：“如果将司法法院视为有限宪法抵御立法侵犯的堡垒，那么这一考虑就为法官的终身任职提供了有力的论据，因为没有什么比这更能培养法官的独立精神了，而这种独立精神对于忠实地履行如此艰巨的职责至关重要。” +

你还记得《联邦党人文集》第51篇中麦迪逊（Madison）的观点吗？他认为，为了使这个新政府正常运转，三个分支中的每一个都必须尽可能独立运作。这基本上就是汉密尔顿在这里为司法分支所主张的观点。终身任命使得法官能够公正地做出裁决，并且不必为了连任而取悦民众。 +

此外，终身任命也具有实际作用。汉密尔顿说，想想联邦法官需要了解的大量先例。如果你在任何时间段更换法官，法官必须学习的内容之多会使这个职位让人望而却步。这是一个问题，因为“法官的任期短暂，自然会让那些有能力的人不愿放弃收入丰厚的法律执业，去接受法官席位，这往往会使司法管理落入能力较差、资质较低的人手中，无法有效地、体面地进行司法管理。” +

所以，根据汉密尔顿的观点，法官的终身任命对于司法分支来说是必要的。然后，他接着讨论了司法分支权力的范围和限制。他说，联邦法官的职责必须是宣布所有与宪法明显主旨相悖的行为无效。司法分支的这种权力被称为司法审查（judicial review）。法院负责审议国会通过的法律，并确保这些法律符合宪法。如果法院发现法律不符合宪法并做出这样的裁决，那么有问题的法律将被视为无效。 +

现在，汉密尔顿的反对者认为，这种权力会使司法分支比代表人民的立法分支更有权力。听起来是这样，对吧？如果联邦法院可以推翻立法机构通过的法律，那么听起来司法分支的权力更大。但汉密尔顿不同意：“没有什么立场比这一原则更明确了，即任何被授权的机构的行为，如果与授权的主旨相悖，都是无效的。因此，任何与宪法相悖的立法行为都是无效的。” 换句话说，如果立法机构通过了一项违反宪法的法律，该法律本身就是无效的，因为任何违宪的法律对受宪法管辖的人民都没有约束力。 +

通过这种方式，法院被设计成人民和立法机构之间的中间机构，“除其他事项外，要使立法机构在其被赋予的权力范围内行事。” 然后，他接着解释为什么这种情况并没有赋予司法分支不适当的权力：“这个结论绝不意味着司法权力高于立法权力。它只是意味着人民的权力高于这两个分支，而且如果立法机构在法规中宣布的意愿与宪法中人民的意愿相悖，法官应该以宪法为准，而不是以立法机构的意愿为准。” +

所以总结一下：联邦法官的终身任命对于使他们保持独立、不依赖民众意愿来说是必要的，而且司法分支的司法审查权力并没有使联邦法院系统比立法机构更有权力，而是对立法机构进行平衡和制衡。 +

Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at another one of your required documents for AP Government, namely Federalist 78. So if you're ready to give me a lifetime appointment to milk your brain cows, then let's get to it.

Now, the Federalist Papers were of course written to argue for the ratification of the newly drafted Constitution, and Federalist 78, written by our boy Alexander Hamilton, is all about the judicial branch of the new federal government outlined in the Constitution.

So to summarize: lifetime appointments for federal judges are necessary to keep them independent and unreliant on popular will, and the judicial branch's power of judicial review does not make the federal court system more powerful than the legislature, but rather balances and checks it.
