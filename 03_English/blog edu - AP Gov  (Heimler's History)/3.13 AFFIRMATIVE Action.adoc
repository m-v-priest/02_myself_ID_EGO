Well, hey then, welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 3 of the AP Government curriculum 课程，and this is the last video for the whole unit, so that means it's time to talk about affirmative action 平权行动. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +
So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how the Supreme Court 最高法院 has at times allowed the restriction of the civil rights 公民权利 of minority groups 少数群体 and at other times has protected those rights. So let's start by defining affirmative action, and then we'll look at a few cases that give us an idea regarding how the court has ruled on this topic. +
Affirmative action 平权行动 as a concept 概念 describes policies and acts 政策与行为 that favor 偏袒 groups that have been historically discriminated against 历史上遭受歧视的群体. While affirmative action has been in place 实施 in some form since the 19th century, the modern version of it has roots in 源于 an executive order 行政命令 signed by John F. Kennedy, which was concerning the employment of federal contractors 联邦承包商的雇佣. And it said this: "The contractor will take affirmative action 采取平权行动 to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to 不论 their race, creed 信仰，color, or national origin 民族出身." +
So that's the idea. Affirmative action takes an active approach 积极方法 against discrimination 歧视 instead of hoping that passive discrimination laws will result in equity 公平. In other words, a government contractor had to actively seek 积极寻找 different minorities to do work for the federal government, instead of just opening jobs and saying that anyone who applies can have. As you can imagine, such a policy got folks all kinds of angry, and you know those folks were mostly white people who thought that such a policy -- although resembling equality on its face 表面上看似平等 -- actually discriminated against them. +
And that brings us to several Supreme Court cases that have wrestled with 努力解决 this idea of affirmative action: is it constitutional 合宪的 or is it not? Now before we get into the cases, you need to understand the debate underneath the debate. On the surface, these cases were about whether it was constitutional to have minority quotas 少数群体配额 in various institutions 机构. But under that debate was the more fundamental question 根本问题: is the constitution colorblind 色盲的；不考虑种族因素的？On the one side, you had justices 法官 who insisted that the constitution makes no claims regarding race, and therefore should not be invoked 援引 in racial questions. On the other side are justices who argue that the constitution forbids 禁止 racial classifications 种族分类 only when it harms certain races, but does not forbid them if those classifications help historically discriminated races. +
Okay, so with that understanding in place 基于这样的理解，let's have a look at how the Supreme Court has ruled on the topic of affirmative action -- and spoiler alert 剧透警告，it is not favorable 不容乐观. In making these rulings, the court is always trying to make the distinction between de jure 法律上的 and de facto 事实上的 segregation 种族隔离. De jure segregation is racial discrimination by law 法律规定的种族歧视，and the prime example 典型例子 of this was the Jim Crow laws 吉姆・克劳法 in the south. De facto segregation on the other hand 另一方面 is racial segregation by personal choice 个人选择导致的种族隔离. For example, during the Great Migration 大迁徙，lots of black families moved to the north and precipitated 引发 what's known as the white flight 白人外迁 out of the cities into the suburbs 从城市到郊区. So in that case, racial segregation had occurred between cities and suburbs, but not by law -- rather, it was by the choice of white families moving out of places where black people were living. +
Now the court ruled against de jure segregation in the Brown v. the Board of Education 布朗诉教育委员会案 ruling, and that dismantled 废除 the legal structure 法律结构 that supported racial segregation. But in many cases that followed where de jure segregation was not clear, the court has generally ruled against affirmative action. The clearest example of that is the non-required case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke 加利福尼亚大学董事会诉巴基案. In this 1978 case, the University of California's medical school 加利福尼亚大学医学院 admitted 100 applicants every year, and their affirmative action policy 平权行动政策 was to reserve 预留 16 of those spots 名额 for minorities and women. So that meant for 16 of those spots, minorities and women could have lower qualifications 资质 and still beat out 击败 white applicants. +
And wouldn't you know it, that's exactly what happened to a white applicant named Alan Bakke. He was denied admission 拒绝录取 and then went ahead and sued the university 起诉大学，saying that the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案 was violated 违反 because he was declined entrance 拒绝入学 based only on his race. You're like: "Wait, wasn't he white?" And the answer is yes, that's the point. He said that because the university had established race and gender quotas 种族和性别配额 for admission, that he was the victim of reverse discrimination 逆向歧视. +
Well, the decision handed down 作出裁决 in the case was that such mandatory quotas 强制性配额 were in fact unconstitutional. However, the court didn't say that affirmative action was unconstitutional, which is to say race could still be used as a factor 因素 in determining applicants' qualifications for the school, but race couldn't be the only factor in their decision. +
Now this principle 原则 was further upheld 支持 in another non-required case called Ricci v. DeStefano in 2009 里奇诉德斯特凡诺案. In that case, a group of firefighters 消防员 took an exam 参加考试 to be promoted 晋升 within their department 部门. When the scores came back, none of the black firefighters scored well enough to be promoted, and so the city threw out the scores 取消成绩 and didn't promote anyone. Well, the high-scoring firefighters sued, and the case eventually came before the Supreme Court, and the court ruled that again this was not a case of de jure segregation, but rather the exam appeared to be a good measure of knowledge for the job to which the applicants aspired 渴望得到的工作. So in that case, we have another example of the court operating from a colorblind perspective 不考虑种族因素的视角. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第三单元，这是整个单元的最后一个视频，这意味着是时候讨论平权行动了。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释最高法院有时如何允许限制少数群体的公民权利，而有时又如何保护这些权利。所以我们先定义平权行动，然后我们来看几个案例，从中了解法院在这个话题上的裁决。 +

平权行动作为一个概念，描述的是有利于历史上遭受歧视群体的政策和行动。虽然平权行动自19世纪以来就以某种形式存在，但现代版本的平权行动源于约翰·F·肯尼迪（John F. Kennedy）签署的一项行政命令，该命令与联邦承包商的雇佣有关。它是这样说的：“承包商将采取平权行动，确保求职者被雇佣，并且员工在受雇期间，不受种族、信仰、肤色或民族出身的影响。” +

这就是平权行动的理念。平权行动采取积极的方式反对歧视，而不是寄希望于被动的反歧视法律来实现公平。换句话说，政府承包商必须积极寻找不同的少数群体为联邦政府工作，而不是仅仅开放职位并说任何申请者都可以获得工作。正如你可以想象的那样，这样的政策让人们非常愤怒，而这些人大多是白人，他们认为这样的政策——尽管表面上看起来是平等的——实际上是在歧视他们。 +

这就引出了几个最高法院关于平权行动的案例：平权行动合宪还是不合宪？在我们深入研究这些案例之前，你需要理解这些案例背后的争议。表面上，这些案例是关于在各种机构中设定少数群体配额是否合宪。但在这一争议之下，有一个更根本的问题：宪法是否是不考虑种族因素的？一方面，有些大法官坚持认为宪法没有对种族问题提出要求，因此在种族问题上不应该援引宪法。另一方面，有些大法官认为，宪法只禁止那些伤害某些种族的种族分类，但如果这些分类是为了帮助历史上遭受歧视的种族，宪法并不禁止。 +

好的，有了这样的理解，让我们看看最高法院在平权行动这个话题上的裁决——剧透一下，裁决结果并不乐观。在做出这些裁决时，法院总是试图区分法律上的隔离（de jure segregation）和事实上的隔离（de facto segregation）。法律上的隔离是指通过法律进行的种族歧视，最典型的例子是南方的吉姆·克劳法（Jim Crow laws）。而事实上的隔离是指基于个人选择的种族隔离。例如，在大迁徙期间，许多黑人家庭搬到了北方，引发了所谓的白人从城市向郊区的迁徙。所以在那种情况下，种族隔离发生在城市和郊区之间，但不是通过法律，而是白人家庭选择搬离黑人居住的地方。 +

现在，最高法院在 “布朗诉教育委员会案”（Brown v. the Board of Education）的裁决中反对法律上的隔离，并且废除了支持种族隔离的法律结构。但在随后的许多案例中，当法律上的隔离不明确时，法院通常会做出反对平权行动的裁决。最明显的例子是 “加利福尼亚大学董事会诉巴基案”（Regents of the University of California v. Bakke），这是一个非必学案例。在1978年的这个案例中，加利福尼亚大学医学院每年录取100名申请者，他们的平权行动政策是为少数群体和女性预留16个名额。这意味着在这16个名额中，少数群体和女性可以在资质较低的情况下，胜过白人申请者。 +

你可能会想，这种情况确实发生在了一个名叫艾伦·巴基（Alan Bakke）的白人申请者身上。他申请被拒后，继续起诉这所大学，称第十四修正案被违反了，因为他仅仅因为种族原因被拒绝入学。你可能会问：“等等，他不是白人吗？” 答案是肯定的，这就是关键所在。他说，因为大学在录取时设定了种族和性别配额，所以他是反向歧视的受害者。 +

嗯，这个案件的裁决是，这种强制性配额实际上是违宪的。然而，法院并没有说平权行动是违宪的，也就是说，种族仍然可以作为确定申请者入学资格的一个因素，但种族不能成为他们做出决定的唯一因素。 +

这个原则在2009年的另一个非必学案例 “里奇诉德斯特凡诺案”（Ricci v. DeStefano）中得到了进一步的支持。在这个案例中，一群消防员参加了部门内的晋升考试。当成绩出来时，没有一个黑人消防员的分数高到足以晋升，所以该市取消了这些分数，并且没有晋升任何人。嗯，高分的消防员起诉了，这个案件最终提交到了最高法院，法院裁决这再次不是法律上的隔离案例，而是这个考试似乎是衡量申请者对他们所追求工作的知识水平的一个好方法。所以在这个案例中，我们又看到了法院从种族中立的角度做出的裁决。 +
