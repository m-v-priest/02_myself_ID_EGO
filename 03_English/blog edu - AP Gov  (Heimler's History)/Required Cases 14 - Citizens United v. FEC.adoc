Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at yet another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission 联合公民诉联邦选举委员会案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then let's get to it. +  

As always, let's begin with the facts of the case. Now this case is all about campaign finance laws 竞选财务法, and I have a whole video going into depth on that and you can see it right over here for a more robust 详尽的 history. But here we're going to start with the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Act (or BCRA) 《两党竞选财务法》passed in 2002. In addition to articulating 明确规定 limits for individuals contributing money to political candidates, there's really just one thing you need to know about this act with respect to 关于 the Citizens United case: part of the BCRA law made it illegal for corporations or non-profits to engage in 参与 electioneering communications 竞选宣传 for 60 days before an election or 30 days before a primary 初选. So you want to pay a butt load of （俚语，大量）money to smear 诋毁 a candidate? Fine. But once we hit that 60 days before the election, you got to shut your mouth. +  

Now during the 2008 Democratic primaries, a close contest 激烈竞争 for the party nomination 提名 was heating up between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. A conservative group called Citizens United decided to make a film called "Hillary: The Movie." The film was full of damning 确凿的 accusations 指控 against Clinton and was intended to derail 破坏 her bid for 争取 the presidency. However, by the time it was ready to be released, it was already during that forbidden 被禁止的 period in which corporations had to keep their mouth holes shut about political candidates thanks to BCRA. And so Citizens United challenged 质疑 this portion of the law, and it went all the way to the Supreme Court. +  

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中? Well, Citizens United argued that BCRA's prohibition 禁止 against electioneering communications by corporations was a violation 违反 of the First Amendment's 第一修正案 protection of the freedom of speech 言论自由. Maybe you're like, "Wait a minute, a corporation isn't a person, so how can it have protected speech?" Well, it's too complicated to get into here, but the short story is that since the 1800s, the Supreme Court has pretty consistently 一贯地 ruled that corporations are just associations 团体 of individuals, and in many cases constitutional civil liberties 公民自由 extend to 适用于 them as well. +  

So what was the decision? It was decided 5-4 in favor of 作出对…有利的裁决 Citizens United. The court argued that limitations 限制 put upon corporations for running political advertisements and communications were not materially 实质上 different from government censorship 审查 of speech toward individuals. Therefore, that part of BCRA was struck down 废除. Now ultimately 最终 for "Hillary: The Movie," it didn't really matter that much because this was decided two years after the Democratic primary. Even so, this was a victory for Citizens United nonetheless 尽管如此. +  

Okay, so why does this case matter? Well, the perennial 长期存在的 question when it comes to campaign finance is this: since money equals speech in the political arena 领域, is it fair for those with the most money to have the loudest voices? In the Citizens United case, the Supreme Court essentially 实质上 said, "Yeah, that's fair." So now corporations and labor unions 工会 and non-profits and other organizations can spend as much money as they want -- provided that 条件是 they don't collaborate directly with 直接合作 the candidate -- on political communication right up to election day. +  

The campaign finance reform laws were put into place 实施 to put the kibosh on 制止 corruption 腐败 in elections, but the court ruled that just because a friendly organization is spending a bunch of money on a candidate's behalf 代表 doesn't necessarily 不一定 mean that the candidate owes them favors -- which is already illegal under other laws. At the end of the day, this is an issue that still ruffles feathers 引发争议 and is far from being decided in the minds of the American public, even if it is decided in the courts. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即“联合公民诉联邦选举委员会案（Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

一如既往，我们先从案件事实讲起。这个案件完全围绕竞选财务法展开，我有一整个视频深入探讨过这个主题，你可以点击这里了解更全面的背景。但在这里，我们将从2002年通过的《两党竞选财务法》（Bipartisan Campaign Finance Act，简称BCRA）开始讲起。除了明确个人向政治候选人捐款的限额之外，关于这个法案，你只需要了解与“联合公民案”相关的一点：BCRA的部分内容规定，企业或非营利组织在选举前60天或初选前30天内从事“竞选宣传”属于非法行为。所以，如果你想花一大笔钱抹黑某位候选人？没问题。但一旦进入选举前60天的期限，你就必须闭嘴。 +  

2008年民主党初选期间，希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）和巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）之间激烈的党内提名竞争正在升温。一个名为“联合公民”（Citizens United）的保守派团体决定制作一部名为《希拉里：电影》（Hillary: The Movie）的影片。这部影片充满了对克林顿的不利指控，旨在阻挠她的总统竞选。然而，当影片准备上映时，已经进入了BCRA规定的企业必须对政治候选人保持沉默的禁言期。因此，“联合公民”组织对该法律条款提出质疑，案件最终上诉至最高法院。 +  

这里涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？“联合公民”组织辩称，BCRA对企业从事竞选宣传的禁令违反了宪法第一修正案（First Amendment）对言论自由的保护。你可能会想：“等等，企业又不是自然人，怎么会有受保护的言论权？” 这个问题在这里展开讨论过于复杂，但简而言之，自19世纪以来，最高法院一直一致裁定企业是个人的联合体，在许多情况下，宪法赋予的公民自由也适用于企业。 +  

判决结果如何呢？最高法院以5比4的裁决支持了“联合公民”组织。法院认为，对企业投放政治广告和进行政治宣传的限制，与政府对个人言论的审查实质上并无不同。因此，BCRA的相关条款被废除。尽管对于《希拉里：电影》而言，这一裁决其实意义不大，因为它是在民主党初选两年后才作出的。即便如此，这对“联合公民”组织来说仍是一场胜利。 +  

那么，这个案件为何重要呢？关于竞选财务，一个长期存在的问题是：既然在政治领域“金钱即言论”，那么让最富有的人拥有最大的话语权是否公平？在“联合公民案”中，最高法院实质上回答：“是的，这是公平的。” 因此，现在企业、工会、非营利组织和其他机构可以在选举日之前自由投入大量资金进行政治宣传——前提是不与候选人直接合作。 +  

竞选财务改革法的初衷是遏制选举中的腐败，但法院裁定，仅仅因为一个友好组织为某位候选人花了大量资金，并不一定意味着候选人欠他们人情——根据其他法律，这种行为已经是非法的。归根结底，尽管法院已作出裁决，但这个问题仍然引发争议，在美国公众心中远未达成共识。 +  

以上就是你需要了解的关于“联合公民诉联邦选举委员会案”的内容。如果你需要，我这里有关于所有其他必修案例的视频。如果你需要帮助在课堂上取得A的成绩并在考试中获得5分，点击这里获取我的复习资料包，所有梦想都将成真。最后，如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作此类视频，请务必订阅，我会照做的。海姆勒，退出。 +
