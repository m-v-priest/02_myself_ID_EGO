Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're looking at another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 in the AP Government curriculum 课程, and that means it's time to look at Baker v. Carr 贝克诉卡尔案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then let's get to it. +  

Okay, first -- as always -- let's get the facts of the case. So this case was decided in 1962, and by that point, the state of Tennessee hadn't redrawn 重新划分 its legislative districts 立法选区 in over 60 years. In that time, Tennessee's urban populations 城市人口 had grown much faster than its rural populations 农村人口, and therefore, since the districts had not been redrawn to reflect 反映 those changes, rural voters 农村选民 had much more voting power 投票权 than did urban voters 城市选民. Let me show you how that works using some basic numbers: if 100 people live in this urban district over here, and then five people live in this rural district over here, and both of them get one representative 代表 with one vote, then you can see that this group's vote counts for way more than this group's vote. +  

So why had Tennessee been so negligent 疏忽的 in their redistricting 重新划分选区? Well, the reasons are complicated, but one of the major reasons is that the Supreme Court had already decided that questions of redistricting were not justiciable 可由法院裁决的 -- which means that the court had no business ruling on 对…作出裁决 such things. They argued that it was a political question, not a justice question. Snip snap, that's that, as nobody says. But in Baker v. Carr, that conclusion is going to change. +  

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中 here? Well, it was the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案, and especially the Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款. Remember that the 14th Amendment says that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction 管辖范围 the equal protection of the laws. This amendment deals with state infringements 侵犯 upon liberty 自由, and the argument was that by refusing to redraw the districts and reapportion 重新分配 representatives, all citizens in Tennessee were patently 明显地 not equally protected under the law, and therefore -- you bet your sweet bippy -- that this question is justiciable. +  

Okay, so what was the decision? Well, first of all, I should probably tell you that this was an agonizing 痛苦的 decision for the court to make. In fact, biographers 传记作者 and historians argue that the stress of this case very much contributed to 导致 the poor health and ultimate demise 死亡 of one of the justices. But regardless, the court decided that issues of reapportionment 重新分配代表名额 were in fact justiciable, and therefore the Supreme Court did have authority 权力 to rule on questions of legislative reapportionment. +  

Now you're probably asking yourself why in the world this is such a big decision, and why did it kill a guy who was wrestling with it? Well, in order to answer that, let's talk about why this case matters. First of all, the case established the foundation 基础 of the one-person, one-vote doctrine 原则, in which states were required to apportion 分配 the representatives in a way that equally represented all the people, so that no votes counted any more than any other vote. Second, combined with 与…结合 several subsequent 随后的 decisions, Baker v. Carr fundamentally 根本地 altered 改变 the nature of political representation 政治代表制 across the United States. Following this decision, many states had to redraw their districts -- and some of them more than once -- in order to make sure that the rural votes were not more powerful than the urban votes. And third, this decision got the Supreme Court involved in an area where it had only been minimally 极少地 involved in the past -- namely, political questions like redistricting. That meant that there was a whole new set of questions that could potentially 可能地 be raised before the Supreme Court. +  

However, I should mention that as a result of this decision, the court wasn't going to get involved in every political question. They established a six-part test in this decision that would help future justices decide when an issue before the court was only political in nature and thus should be avoided, and when an issue was justiciable and should thus be considered. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，也就是“贝克诉卡尔案（Baker v. Carr）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

首先——和往常一样——我们来了解一下案件事实。这个案件于1962年作出裁决，当时田纳西州（Tennessee）已经60多年没有重新划分其立法选区了。在这段时间里，田纳西州的城市人口增长速度远远超过农村人口，因此，由于选区没有重新划分以反映这些变化，农村选民的投票权比城市选民大得多。让我用一些基本数字来解释一下：如果这边这个城市选区有100人居住，而那边这个农村选区只有5人居住，并且两者都有一名代表和一票，那么你可以看到，这个农村群体的选票比城市群体的选票重要得多。 +  

那么，为什么田纳西州在重新划分选区方面如此疏忽呢？原因很复杂，但主要原因之一是最高法院此前已判定重新划分选区的问题属于“不可司法裁判”（not justiciable）——也就是说，法院无权对此类事项作出裁决。他们认为这是一个政治问题，而非司法问题。虽然没人这么说，但情况就是如此。但在“贝克诉卡尔案”中，这一结论即将改变。 +  

这里涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？是第十四修正案（14th Amendment），尤其是平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）。请记住，第十四修正案规定，任何州不得制定或执行任何剥夺其管辖范围内任何人受法律平等保护的法律。该修正案涉及州对自由的侵犯，而本案的论点是，田纳西州拒绝重新划分选区和重新分配代表席位，显然导致该州所有公民没有受到法律的平等保护，因此——毫无疑问——这个问题属于可司法裁判的范畴。 +  

那么，判决结果如何呢？首先，我需要告诉你，这个判决对最高法院来说是一个艰难的决定。事实上，传记作者和历史学家认为，本案的压力极大地影响了其中一位大法官的健康状况，并最终导致他的去世。但无论如何，最高法院判定，重新分配席位的问题实际上属于可司法裁判的范畴，因此最高法院确实有权对立法重新分配席位的问题作出裁决。 +  

你可能会问，为什么这个判决如此重要，又为什么会导致一位大法官为此心力交瘁？为了回答这个问题，我们需要谈谈这个案件的重要性。首先，该案件确立了“一人一票”（one-person, one-vote）原则的基础，要求各州以平等代表所有公民的方式分配代表席位，使任何选票都不会比其他选票更具权重。其次，结合随后的几项裁决，“贝克诉卡尔案”从根本上改变了美国各地政治代表的性质。在此判决之后，许多州不得不重新划分选区——有些州甚至多次重新划分——以确保农村选票的权重不高于城市选票。第三，该判决使最高法院介入了一个此前极少涉足的领域，即像重新划分选区这样的政治问题。这意味着，今后可能会有一系列全新的问题被提交至最高法院。 +  

不过，我需要说明的是，作为这一判决的结果，最高法院并不会介入所有政治问题。在该判决中，法院确立了一个六要素检验标准（six-part test），以帮助未来的大法官判断提交至法院的问题何时仅属于政治性质并应予以回避，何时属于可司法裁判性质并应予以审理。 +
