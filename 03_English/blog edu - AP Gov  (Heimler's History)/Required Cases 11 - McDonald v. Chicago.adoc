Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at yet another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 McDonald v. Chicago 麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +  

So just like in all of my required case videos, let's begin with the facts of the case. The facts of this case actually begin with another case that had been decided in 2008, namely Heller v. the District of Columbia 海勒诉哥伦比亚特区案. In that case, the court ruled that the restrictive 限制性的 gun ownership laws in Washington D.C. were unconstitutional 违宪的. However, because D.C. is a federal district 联邦特区, that ruling only applied to federal territory 联邦管辖区域. +  

So a man named Otis McDonald, along with a few other Chicago residents, decided to do what they could to apply this decision to the state. For McDonald's part, he was a grandfather whose street had been taken over by gangs 帮派, and his house had been robbed five times. As a hunter, he owned several rifles 步枪 and shotguns 猎枪 legally, but argued that such large guns weren't practical 实际的 for use in self-defense 自卫 in case of a midnight break-in 入室盗窃. So he wanted to buy a handgun 手枪. But the problem was that Chicago arguably 可以说 had the most restrictive handgun laws in the nation, and so the constitutionality 合宪性 of those laws was brought before the Supreme Court. +  

Okay, so what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中 in this case? Well, this is pretty obviously a case about the Second Amendment's 第二修正案 protection of a citizen's right to bear arms 携带武器. McDonald and the folks who filed with him argued that Chicago's restrictive gun laws infringed upon 侵犯 their right to own guns, especially after the ruling in the Heller case. However, the opposing side argued that restrictive gun laws were necessary to uphold 维护 public order and safety. And remember, in cases like these, that's always the balance the court is trying to strike: do we uphold personal liberty 个人自由 at the expense of 以…为代价 public order and safety, or vice versa? +  

Well, to see which they chose, let's look at the decision the court handed down. The court ruled in favor of 作出对…有利的裁决 McDonald and the other petitioners 请愿人, arguing that Chicago's gun laws were indeed a violation 违反 of these citizens' Second Amendment rights. However, always keep in mind that although this is a case about the Second Amendment, it's not only a case about the Second Amendment. +  

It's confusing? Well then, let me explain it up real nice for you. Remember that the Second Amendment -- along with the other nine amendments in the Bill of Rights 权利法案 -- only protects citizens from the federal government, not the state government. It was the passage of the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案 with its Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款 that allowed the court to apply the Bill of Rights to state governments as well. And that's why the court can rule on a state law about guns. +  

And it's very important that you understand the logic of what happened as a result of this case. So follow me here as I consider why this case matters. Since the Heller case only applied to federal territory and not to the states, the McDonald decision applied that same ruling to the states. This process is what's known as selective incorporation 选择性纳入, which is the means by which the court applies the civil liberties 公民自由 found in the Bill of Rights to the states. And so the result of this decision was that any state or city that had similar restrictive gun laws had to rewrite their laws to fall in line with 符合 the McDonald ruling. +  

And why? Well because, as Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion 多数意见: "It is clear that the framers and the ratifiers 批准者 of the 14th Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights 基本权利 necessary to our system of ordered liberty 有序自由体系." On the other hand, dissenting judges 持异议的法官 argued that there was nothing in the history or logic of the Second Amendment that made gun ownership a fundamental right. But alas 唉, their argument did not carry the day 占上风. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即“麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案（McDonald v. Chicago）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

就像我所有关于必修案例的视频一样，我们先从案件事实讲起。这个案件的事实实际上始于2008年判决的另一个案件，即“海勒诉哥伦比亚特区案（Heller v. the District of Columbia）”。在该案中，法院裁定华盛顿哥伦比亚特区（Washington D.C.）限制枪支拥有的法律违宪。然而，由于哥伦比亚特区是联邦直辖区，该裁决仅适用于联邦管辖区域。 +  

因此，一位名叫奥蒂斯·麦克唐纳（Otis McDonald）的男子和其他几位芝加哥（Chicago）居民决定尝试将这一裁决适用于州政府。就麦克唐纳而言，他是一位祖父，他所在的街道已被帮派占据，他的家被抢劫了五次。作为一名猎人，他合法拥有几支步枪和霰弹枪，但他认为在午夜闯入事件中，此类大型枪支并不适合用于自卫。因此，他想购买一支手枪。但问题在于，芝加哥的手枪法律可以说是全美最严格的，因此这些法律的合宪性被提交至最高法院。 +  

那么，本案涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？显然，这是一个关于宪法第二修正案（Second Amendment）保护公民持枪权的案件。麦克唐纳和与其共同提起诉讼的人认为，芝加哥的限制性枪支法律侵犯了他们拥有枪支的权利，尤其是在“海勒案”裁决之后。然而，反对方认为，限制性枪支法律对于维护公共秩序和安全是必要的。记住，在这类案件中，法院始终试图在个人自由与公共秩序和安全之间取得平衡：我们是要以公共秩序和安全为代价维护个人自由，还是反之？ +  

为了了解法院的选择，我们来看一下判决结果。最高法院作出了支持麦克唐纳和其他请愿者的裁决，认为芝加哥的枪支法律确实侵犯了这些公民的第二修正案权利。然而，必须始终牢记，尽管这是一个关于第二修正案的案件，但它又不仅仅是一个关于第二修正案的案件。 +  

这很令人困惑吗？那么，让我为你好好解释一下。请记住，第二修正案——与《权利法案》（Bill of Rights）中的其他九项修正案一样——仅保护公民免受联邦政府的干预，而不适用于州政府。正是第十四条修正案（14th Amendment）及其平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）的通过，使法院能够将《权利法案》的规定也适用于州政府。这就是法院能够对州枪支法律作出裁决的原因。 +  

理解本案所产生的逻辑非常重要。请跟上我的思路，看看这个案件为何重要。由于“海勒案”仅适用于联邦管辖区域而不适用于各州，“麦克唐纳案”的裁决将同样的规则适用于各州。这一过程被称为“选择性纳入（selective incorporation）”，即法院将《权利法案》中的公民自由权适用于各州的方式。因此，该裁决的结果是，任何拥有类似限制性枪支法律的州或城市都必须修改其法律，以符合“麦克唐纳案”的裁决。 +  

为什么呢？正如大法官塞缪尔·阿利托（Samuel Alito）在多数意见中所写：“显然，第十四条修正案的制定者和批准者将持有和携带武器的权利视为我们有秩序自由制度所必需的基本权利之一。” 另一方面，持异议的法官认为，从第二修正案的历史或逻辑来看，没有任何内容表明拥有枪支是一项基本权利。但可惜的是，他们的论点未能占上风。 +
