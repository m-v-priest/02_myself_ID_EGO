Well, hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 3 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video that means it's time to talk about the balance between majority and minority rights 多数群体与少数群体权利的平衡. So if you're ready to get them brain cells milked, then let's get to it. +

So in this video, we're gonna try to do two things: first, explain how the government has responded to social movements 社会运动, and second, explain how the Supreme Court 最高法院 has at times allowed the restriction of the civil rights 公民权利 of minority groups 少数群体 and at other times has protected those rights. So just like in the last video, this is a video about civil rights and how the civil liberties 公民自由 outlined 概述 in the Bill of Rights 权利法案 have been applied to Americans -- or in some cases, how they have not been equally applied. +

Since we already talked about the various civil rights movements in the last video, let's begin by considering how the government has responded to those movements. One of the chief goals 主要目标 of the civil rights movement for black Americans 美国黑人民权运动 was to abolish segregation 废除种族隔离 in society. Now racial segregation 种族隔离 had been made the law of the land 成为国家法律 by a landmark 具有里程碑意义的 Supreme Court case called Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. As a result of that case, the court ruled that racial segregation was perfectly constitutional 合宪的 as long as the various facilities 设施 for black people and white people were equal, and that was what became known as the "separate but equal" doctrine “隔离但平等”原则. +

So that decision was all that some states needed to pass laws that restricted black Americans from restaurants and public facilities, and more to the point 更重要的是 for this video -- schools. So as the devotees 拥护者 of the civil rights movement reminded America, this segregated situation was in no way constitutional. When it came to segregation in schools, the black schools were certainly separate from the white schools, but they were never equal in funding 资金. Additionally, just by the mere fact of separation, black students and parents were made to feel like they were second-class citizens 二等公民. And so the Plessy case is a prime example 典型例子 of the court restricting the civil rights of a minority. +

Well, in 1954 and 1955, a series of cases under the heading of Brown v. the Board of Education 布朗诉教育委员会案 came before the court to address this inequity 不公平 in the school system. Now since this is a required case 必学案例, I've got a whole video devoted to it 专门讲解它, so here let me just say that the Brown decision effectively overturned 推翻 the "separate but equal" doctrine and ordered schools to be integrated 实现种族融合. The court ruled that racial separation is inherently unequal 本质上不平等 no matter the state of the various facilities and the staff, and they did so based on the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause 第十四修正案的平等保护条款. This is an example of the court upholding minority rights 维护少数群体权利. +

So that's the court, but Congress 国会 also responded to these various civil rights movements as well. About a decade after the Brown decision, Congress passed two laws that upheld the rights of black Americans. First was the Civil Rights Act of 1964 1964年民权法案, which made it illegal to discriminate against 歧视 anyone on the basis of race 基于种族原因. As a result of this, all the segregated facilities not covered by the Brown decision were required to integrate. Second, the next year saw the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 1965年选举权法案, which made it illegal to discriminate against voters 选民. You see, before this law went into effect 生效, several states had enacted 颁布 poll taxes 人头税 or literacy tests 识字测试 that had to be paid or passed in order to vote. This was a thinly veiled strategy 隐晦的策略 to keep black Americans out of the voting booth 投票站. But with the passage of the Voting Rights Act and the 24th Amendment 第二十四修正案 which officially outlawed 宣布…为非法 poll taxes, Congress upheld the franchise 选举权 for minorities. +

Now I just have to say that although all this is true on paper 理论上, it's not as though those civil rights have always been upheld since then. Even so, these responses from the federal government were good steps in the right direction. +

Now on the front of the women's rights movement 女权运动, Congress also acted to uphold the rights of women. Front and center 首要的是 here was Title IX of the Education Amendments Act in 1972 1972年教育修正案第九条. Now the need for this law grew out of a glaring omission 明显的疏漏 in the Civil Rights Act. Title VI of that law explicitly bans discrimination 明确禁止歧视 with respect to 关于 federally funded programs 联邦资助项目 like schools, and in the language of Title VI it says that discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin 种族、肤色或民族出身 is illegal. But all the women in America sat up and were like: "Really? Sounds like you missed something. No, we got race, color, national origin -- that's all the discrimination categories?" "Really? You can't think of one other group that has been the subject of discrimination?" [Music] "Yeah, I got nothing." +

Anyway, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act plugged up that omission from the Civil Rights Act by guaranteeing that discrimination in federally funded programs could not happen on the basis of sex 性别 as well as race. One of the most visible outcomes 显著成果 of Title IX was the rise of women's sports programs in colleges 大学女子体育项目的兴起. +

Okay, now let's discuss one other way that the government has responded to civil rights movements with respect to voting 选举权, and that has to do with 与…有关 the drawing of majority-minority districts 多数-少数族裔选区的划分. A majority-minority district 多数-少数族裔选区 is a district in which the majority is a minority 多数人口为少数族裔的选区. Now remember from Unit 2 that every 10 years when the data comes in from the census 人口普查, we find out where everyone is living and congressional districts 国会选区 are redrawn 重新划分 in order to make sure that everyone is represented equally -- which is to say, to make sure that every person's vote counts equally 每个人的选票具有同等效力. And Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act 选举权法案第二条 made clear that districts could not be drawn in order to dilute 削弱 the voting power 投票权 of racial minorities 少数族裔. And that principle was upheld in the non-required case of Thornburg v. Gingles 桑伯格诉金格斯案, which I confess gives me great pleasure to say. +

Anyway, it turned out that North Carolina 北卡罗来纳州 had drawn seven new districts in which it was basically impossible for black votes to be equal with white votes, and so the court struck that down 推翻 as a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, thus protecting minority rights. But the court ruled in the other way 作出相反裁决 in one of your required cases called Shaw v. Reno 肖诉里诺案, on which again I have a whole video. The short story is that North Carolina drew two majority-minority districts -- which is to say, majority black districts 黑人占多数的选区 -- and submitted the plan to the Justice Department 司法部 for approval. And based on the Voting Rights Act, the Justice Department said: "Sounds good to us." But several North Carolina residents challenged these districts -- which to be fair were drawn in very wonky shapes 奇怪的形状 -- saying that these majority-minority districts were drawn only to help black voters. The word for that, in case you forgot, is racial gerrymandering 种族不公正划分选区. +

Anyway, the court agreed and said that while the districts were definitely created with noble intentions 高尚的意图, they were so bizarre 奇怪的 that the only explanation is that they were racially motivated 出于种族动机. And even if those districts were drawn to increase the power of black voters, districts drawn only with race in mind 只考虑种族因素划分的选区 were deemed unconstitutional 被认定为违宪的. So that's an example of the court ruling in favor of 支持 majority rights 多数群体权利. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第三单元，在这个视频中，这意味着是时候讨论多数人权利与少数人权利之间的平衡了。所以，如果你准备好激发你的脑细胞，那我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要尝试做两件事：第一，解释政府对社会运动的回应方式；第二，解释最高法院有时如何允许限制少数群体的公民权利，而有时又如何保护这些权利。就像在上一个视频中一样，这个视频是关于公民权利的，以及《权利法案》中概述的公民自由是如何应用于美国人的——或者在某些情况下，这些自由是如何没有被平等应用的。 +

既然我们在上一个视频中已经讨论了各种公民权利运动，那我们先考虑政府对这些运动的回应方式。美国黑人公民权利运动的主要目标之一是废除社会中的种族隔离。1896年，在具有里程碑意义的 “普莱西诉弗格森案”（Plessy v. Ferguson）中，种族隔离成为了美国的法律。由于这个案件，法院裁定，只要为黑人和白人提供的各种设施是平等的，种族隔离就是完全符合宪法的，这就是所谓的 “隔离但平等” 原则。 +

所以这个裁决让一些州有了依据来通过法律，限制美国黑人进入餐馆和公共设施，而且更与本视频相关的是——学校。所以，民权运动的追随者提醒美国，这种隔离情况在任何方面都不符合宪法。说到学校里的种族隔离，黑人学校当然与白人学校是分开的，但它们在资金方面从来都不平等。此外，仅仅由于种族隔离这一事实，黑人学生和家长就会觉得自己是二等公民。所以，“普莱西案” 是法院限制少数群体公民权利的一个典型例子。 +

嗯，在1954年和1955年，以 “布朗诉教育委员会案”（Brown v. the Board of Education）为标题的一系列案件提交到了法院，以解决学校系统中的这种不平等问题。既然这是一个必学案件，我有一个完整的视频专门讲这个案子，所以在这里我只想说，“布朗案” 的裁决有效地推翻了 “隔离但平等” 原则，并命令学校实现种族融合。法院裁定，无论各种设施和教职员工的状况如何，种族隔离本质上就是不平等的，他们这样裁定是基于第十四修正案的平等保护条款。这是法院维护少数群体权利的一个例子。 +

这是法院的情况，但国会也对这些各种公民权利运动做出了回应。在 “布朗案” 裁决大约十年后，国会通过了两项维护美国黑人权利的法律。首先是1964年的《民权法案》（Civil Rights Act），该法案规定基于种族歧视任何人都是非法的。因此，所有不受 “布朗案” 裁决涵盖的隔离设施都被要求实现种族融合。其次，第二年即1965年，《选举权法案》（Voting Rights Act）得以通过，该法案规定歧视选民是非法的。你看，在这项法律生效之前，一些州制定了人头税或识字测试，人们必须缴纳人头税或通过识字测试才能投票。这是一种明显的策略，目的是阻止美国黑人进入投票站。但是随着《选举权法案》和正式废除人头税的第二十四修正案的通过，国会维护了少数群体的选举权。 +

现在我必须说，尽管从纸面上看所有这些都是真实的，但从那以后这些公民权利并不总是得到维护。即便如此，联邦政府的这些回应也是朝着正确方向迈出的良好步伐。 +

现在说到妇女权利运动方面，国会也采取行动维护妇女的权利。其中最重要的是1972年《教育修正案法案》的第九条（Title IX of the Education Amendments Act）。这项法律的出台是因为《民权法案》中一个明显的遗漏。该法案的第六条（Title VI）明确禁止在像学校这样的联邦资助项目中存在歧视，并且第六条的措辞规定，基于种族、肤色或民族出身的歧视是非法的。但是美国的所有女性都注意到了这个问题，她们会想：“真的吗？听起来你们遗漏了一些东西。不，我们有基于种族、肤色、民族出身的歧视类别——就这些吗？” “真的吗？你们难道想不到还有其他遭受歧视的群体吗？” [音乐] “是的，我想不到。” +

不管怎样，《教育修正案法案》的第九条填补了《民权法案》中的那个遗漏，它保证在联邦资助项目中，基于性别以及种族的歧视都不能发生。第九条最明显的成果之一是大学里女子体育项目的兴起。 +

好的，现在让我们讨论政府在投票方面对公民权利运动的另一种回应方式，这与划分多数 - 少数群体选区有关。多数 - 少数群体选区是指少数群体占多数的选区。还记得在第二单元中提到的，每10年当人口普查数据出来时，我们会了解每个人的居住地点，并且国会选区会被重新划分，以确保每个人都能得到平等代表——也就是说，确保每个人的选票都具有同等效力。《选举权法案》的第二条明确规定，选区划分不能削弱少数族裔的投票权。在 “桑伯格诉金格斯案”（Thornburg v. Gingles）这个非必学案件中，这一原则得到了维护，我得说我很高兴提到这个案子。 +

不管怎样，结果是北卡罗来纳州划分了七个新选区，在这些选区中，黑人的选票基本上不可能与白人的选票平等，所以法院判定这违反了《选举权法案》的第二条，从而保护了少数群体的权利。但是在一个必学案件 “肖诉雷诺案”（Shaw v. Reno）中，法院做出了不同的裁决，我同样有一个完整的视频讲这个案子。简单来说，北卡罗来纳州划分了两个多数 - 少数群体选区——也就是说，黑人占多数的选区——并将这个划分计划提交给司法部批准。根据《选举权法案》，司法部表示：“我们觉得这个计划不错。” 但是一些北卡罗来纳州的居民对这些选区提出了质疑——公平地说，这些选区的划分形状非常奇怪——他们说这些多数 - 少数群体选区的划分仅仅是为了帮助黑人选民。万一你忘了，这种情况被称为种族划分选区（gerrymandering）。 +

不管怎样，法院同意这种观点，并且表示，虽然这些选区的划分肯定是出于高尚的意图，但它们非常奇怪，唯一的解释是它们是出于种族动机。而且，即使这些选区的划分是为了增加黑人选民的权力，仅仅基于种族划分选区被判定为违宪。所以这是法院做出有利于多数人权利裁决的一个例子。 +

好的，感谢观看。点击这里获取复习资料包，它将帮助你在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分。此外，如果你从这个视频中得到了帮助，并且希望我继续制作这样的视频，那就订阅吧，我会照做的。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +
