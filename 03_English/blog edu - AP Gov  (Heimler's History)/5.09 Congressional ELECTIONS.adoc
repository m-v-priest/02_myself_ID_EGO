Hey there, and welcome back to Homeless History. Now we've been going through Unit 5 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video, it's time to talk about congressional elections 国会选举. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with an incumbency advantage 现任优势, well then, let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how the different processes work in U.S. congressional elections 美国国会选举. If you watched the last video, we talked about how presidential elections work, and in this video on congressional elections, a lot of that information and the process is similar. But thankfully, in congressional elections, we don't have to contend with 对付 that nasty, stinking, hairy beast called the Electoral College 选举人团. So these elections are much more straightforward 直接明了的. +

First, the basics: congressional elections happen every two years. Remember from Unit 2 that members of the House of Representatives 众议院议员 have two-year terms 任期, and senators 参议员 have six-year terms, but one-third of them are up for re-election 重新选举 every two years. So since the president is elected every four years, half the time, congressional elections correspond with 与…一致 the presidential election -- which is to say, we vote for our congressional representatives 国会代表 on the same day that we vote for president. But the elections that happened two years later are called midterm elections 中期选举 because they happen halfway through the presidential term 总统任期中间. +

Now recall from a previous video that the type of election influences how many people vote. Presidential elections, not surprisingly, get the most voters off their couches and into the voting booth 投票站. On the other hand, congressional elections get fewer voters out to the polls 投票站. But even so, many of the same factors influence who gets elected to Congress 国会 and who gets elected president. +

The first factor is the incumbency advantage 现任优势. Remember that in an election, the incumbent 现任者 is the one who is already in office 在职 and is running for re-election 竞选连任. The incumbency advantage in Congress is even more pronounced 明显的 than in the presidential election, since something like 90 percent of incumbents win their elections. Why is that? Well, that is an excellent question, and I reckon 认为 I ought to answer it for you. +

First, the incumbent has the advantage of name recognition 知名度. And I know that sounds basic, but it's about as big a factor for re-election as anything else. Like, if I asked you who the two candidates were for the most recent presidential election, you probably have no trouble telling me their names. But if I asked you which candidates were running for the House and Senate 众议院和参议院 in your district and state, you'd probably look at me like a goat getting milked for the first time （比喻一脸茫然）. And truthfully, you might not even know the names of the representatives who are in office representing you right now. So the point is, our congressional representatives are already pretty forgettable 容易被遗忘的 in the popular imagination 大众印象中. So an incumbent already has the advantage because there's a much greater chance that you've at least heard his or her name. When you go to vote, you're more likely to vote for somebody you've heard of than for someone you have not. +

Second, the incumbent has the advantage of a track record 过往记录. Supposing 假设 the representative isn't a grade-A turd （俚语，非常糟糕的人）, he or she will have some victories to which they can point in order to demonstrate 证明 how well they've served their constituency 选区选民. And that can help them get re-elected. +

Third, the incumbent has the advantage of established funding 既定的资金来源. We all like to think that once we elect our representatives into Congress, they put their head down and focus only on the work of representing the people. "I want to make that come to life for every boy in this land. Yes, and all -- light it up like that too. Wouldn't that be hilarious if they did that?" No. Once they're elected, they spend a good deal of their time working on their campaign for the next election, and no small part of that is raising funds 筹集资金. And the process of raising funds is much easier for an incumbent because they have proven that they can win an election. Additionally 此外, incumbents have a staff who work for them and privileges 特权 to send mail to their constituents 选民 at no cost, reminding them of all the great things they've done. +

And maybe most helpful of all, incumbents have the advantage of safe districts 安全选区. And you know, that's a kind way of saying that congressional representatives in the House gerrymander 不公正地划分选区 their districts in order to assure re-election 确保连任. "Wait, Heimler, isn't that illegal?" Yep, but it happens nonetheless 尽管如此. +

So the point is, it is very hard to unseat 罢免 an incumbent. And just like in presidential elections, congressional candidates are chosen by primary elections 初选. And depending on the state, these can be either open or closed primaries 开放或封闭初选. Now remember, an open primary is where a voter can vote for a candidate of any party, and a closed primary is where a voter has to be registered with the party 党内注册 in order to vote for their party's candidate. Most states use primaries to select their candidates, but some use caucuses 党团会议, which does the same thing as a primary, but instead of selecting a candidate by secret ballot 无记名投票, caucuses choose candidates by open discussion and debate 公开讨论和辩论. +

Okay, that's what you need to know about congressional elections. Click right here to grab my review packet, which is going to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. And if this video helped you and you want me to keep making them, then by all means, subscribe 订阅, and I shall oblige 照办. I'm out. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Homeless History 这里可能是 Heimler's History 的笔误）的历史频道。目前我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第五单元，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈国会选举。所以，如果你准备好利用现任优势来激发自己的思维，那么，我们就开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释美国国会选举的不同流程是如何运作的。如果你看过上一个视频，我们谈到了总统选举是如何进行的，而在这个关于国会选举的视频里，很多信息和流程是类似的。但值得庆幸的是，在国会选举中，我们不必应付那个讨厌的、臭烘烘的、麻烦的 “野兽”，也就是选举人团（Electoral College）。所以这些选举要直接明了得多。 +

首先，基本情况是：国会选举每两年举行一次。还记得在第二单元中，众议员（members of the House of Representatives）的任期是两年，参议员（senators）的任期是六年，但每两年就有三分之一的参议员要进行改选。所以，由于总统是每四年选举一次，有一半的情况是，国会选举与总统选举在同一天进行 —— 也就是说，我们在选举总统的同一天选举我们的国会议员。但两年后举行的选举被称为中期选举（midterm elections），因为它们发生在总统任期的中间。 +

现在，回想一下之前的视频，选举的类型会影响投票的人数。毫不奇怪，总统选举能让最多的选民从沙发上起身去投票站投票。另一方面，国会选举去投票的选民较少。但即便如此，许多影响谁能当选国会议员以及谁能当选总统的因素是相同的。 +

第一个因素是现任优势。记住，在选举中，现任者（incumbent）是已经在任并竞选连任的人。国会选举中的现任优势比总统选举中的更加明显，因为大约90%的现任者能赢得选举。为什么会这样呢？嗯，这是个很好的问题，我觉得我应该为你解答一下。 +

首先，现任者有知名度的优势。我知道这听起来很基础，但这是影响连任的一个重要因素。比如，如果我问你最近一次总统选举的两位候选人是谁，你可能能轻松地告诉我他们的名字。但如果我问你在你的选区和州竞选众议员和参议员的候选人是谁，你可能会像第一次被挤奶的山羊一样看着我（表示困惑）。说实话，你甚至可能不知道现在代表你的众议员的名字。所以重点是，在大众的印象中，我们的国会议员很容易被遗忘。所以现任者已经有了优势，因为你至少听说过他们名字的可能性要大得多。当你去投票时，你更有可能投票给你听说过的人，而不是你不认识的人。 +

其次，现任者有过往政绩的优势。假设这位众议员不是个非常糟糕的人，他或她会有一些可以展示的成就，用以表明他们为选区服务得有多好。这可以帮助他们赢得连任。 +

第三，现任者有既定的资金优势。我们都认为，一旦我们选举我们的众议员进入国会，他们会埋头工作，专注于代表人民。“我想让这片土地上的每个男孩都能实现梦想。是的，还有所有…… 也把它点亮。如果他们那样做，是不是很有趣呢？” 不。一旦他们当选，他们会花大量时间为下一次选举做准备，其中很大一部分就是筹集资金。对于现任者来说，筹集资金的过程要容易得多，因为他们已经证明了自己能赢得选举。此外，现任者有为他们工作的工作人员，还有免费给选民寄信的特权，提醒选民他们做过的所有好事。 +

也许最有帮助的是，现任者有安全选区的优势。你知道，这是一种委婉的说法，意思是众议院的国会议员会进行选区划分（gerrymander），以确保自己能连任。“等等，海姆勒，这不是违法的吗？” 是的，但这种情况还是会发生。 +

所以重点是，要让现任者下台是非常困难的。就像总统选举一样，国会候选人是通过初选（primary elections）选出的。而且根据不同的州，这些初选可以是开放初选（open primary）或封闭初选（closed primary）。现在记住，开放初选是指选民可以投票给任何政党的候选人，而封闭初选是指选民必须登记为该政党的成员才能投票给该党的候选人。大多数州通过初选来选择他们的候选人，但有些州使用党团会议（caucuses），党团会议和初选的作用相同，但党团会议不是通过无记名投票来选择候选人，而是通过公开讨论和辩论来选择候选人。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的关于国会选举的内容。点击这里获取我的复习资料包，这将帮助你在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那么一定要订阅，我会照办的。我说完了。 +
