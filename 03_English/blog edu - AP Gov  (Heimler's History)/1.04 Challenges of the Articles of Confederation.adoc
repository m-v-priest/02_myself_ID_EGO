Hey there and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through 经历；浏览 Unit 1 of the AP Government curriculum 课程体系, and in this video it's time to talk about the piping hot mess 一团糟；混乱局面 that was the Articles of Confederation 邦联条例. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked （一种形象表达，可理解为激发思维、获取知识）, then let's get to it. +

So in this video here's what we're aiming to do: explain the relationship between key provisions 规定；条款 of the Articles of Confederation and the debate over granting 授予；给予 the federal government greater power formerly reserved to the states. Okay, so first, what was the Articles of Confederation? Well, it's one of your required documents in this course, so that means I have a whole video exploring its contents in more detail, but for now let me just give you the basics. +

First of all, let's talk about where it came from. If you go back to July of 1776 when American colonists declared their independence from Britain, you'll see a situation in which now that they had no government, these 13 states needed to create one. And so each state drafted 起草 a constitution for itself, and they varied quite a bit, ranging from more participatory democratic systems 参与式民主制度 to more elite democratic systems 精英民主制度. And as I've said before, this confederated system of government 邦联制政府 meant that in the early days of the United States, it was more like we had 13 separate governments. +

But they quickly realized that in order to do business on the international stage 在国际舞台上 in terms of treaties 条约 and trade and several other concerns, there needed to be a central government that bound 约束；联合 them all together in order to handle those tasks. So that's how you get the Articles of Confederation. It was the first constitution of the United States that bound those 13 states together. And you know, it's debated whether or not it was by definition 从定义上来说 an actual constitution or it was more like a mutually beneficial treaty 互惠条约, but whatever we're calling it, a constitution. +

And since America just broke up with Britain, we had kind of a monarchy hangover 君主制遗留影响, and that means the Articles established a governing system that was about as far from monarchy 君主制 as you could get. Under this system of government, states held most of the power, and the central government was very weak. And look, that was the best thing that the Articles had going for it 对其有利；是其优势所在. This government certainly avoided the tyranny 暴政；专制 of a powerful central government. +

But here's where I tell you that that one strength notwithstanding 尽管；虽然, the Articles had plenty of weak sauce slathered all over it 有很多严重缺陷. The weaknesses included the fact that under the Articles, the federal government had only one branch, which is to say a Congress 国会. Like, there was no executive branch 行政部门, and there was no judicial branch 司法部门. Another weakness is that in order to change or amend 修改；修订 the Articles, it required that all 13 states agreed to the change, and that, to put it mildly 委婉地说, was difficult. I'm looking at you, Rhode Island. +

Another weakness was that Congress had no power to raise tax revenue 税收收入. Like, if the federal government wanted tax money, they just had to ask the states nicely, and you could imagine how that went. "Lisa, could I have some more?" [Music] "That's really cute." Y'all see that? I mean, it got to the point where Congress genuinely couldn't pay their bills. Maybe most significant of those bills was their debt 债务 to Revolutionary War soldiers and veterans 退伍军人, which is going to become a problem, but we'll talk more about that in a second. +

But how about we keep talking about how broke 没钱的；破产的 the federal Congress was for a minute? So in order to remedy 补救；纠正 this problem, Congress proposed a resolution 决议 in 1782 which would grant Congress the power to raise funds 筹集资金 through a five percent tariff 关税. Fair enough. Now eleven states said yes to the proposal, but Virginia was waffling 犹豫不决 a little bit, but then guess who came along and pronounced an unequivocal 明确的；毫不含糊的 no? This is why we can't have nice things. +

Another weakness under the Articles was that there was no national currency 货币. So Georgia had different money than New York, which had different money from Virginia. That created a mess. And finally, the last weakness I'll mention is that Congress had no power to raise a national army 组建国家军队, and that became a pretty massive problem in an event known as Shays' Rebellion 谢司起义. +

Now the economy during this period was, to use a technical term 专业术语, kind of a dumpster fire 极其糟糕的状况. And because Congress had no money, they weren't paying their Revolutionary War soldiers what they were due 应得的报酬. This was a problem for a lot of people, but especially the farmers, many of whom had gone into debt 负债 while they were off fighting the war. And when they returned, many of them had an awful lot of trouble paying back those debts because of inflation 通货膨胀 and new taxes being imposed upon 征收；强加 them. And so what did they do? Well, those farmers petitioned for 请愿；祈求 relief 救济 from state and federal governments. And of course the government was like, "Hey, we support the troops, and we wouldn't even have a country if it weren't for you guys, and you wouldn't even be in debt if we had paid you what we owed you, so you have all the relief you need." Uh, no, that is emphatically  emphatically 强调地；坚决地 not what they said. Instead, the government's offered no relief and demanded that these farmers pay their taxes and pay their debts. +

And that, not surprisingly, got some farmers angry. And as it happens 碰巧；恰巧, one of those farmers was a guy from Massachusetts by the name of Daniel Shays, who decided that these policies were a bunch of bull honky 毫无意义；一派胡言. So he raised a militia 民兵组织 of about a thousand other angry farmers. They headed down to the town arsenal 兵工厂, which they summarily 迅速地；即刻地 raided 突袭, and armed themselves for a proper rebellion 叛乱. Now the resulting fight wasn't much of a fight. The Massachusetts authorities gathered their own militia and pretty much crushed 镇压；粉碎 the rebellion. +

So why am I even talking about this? Because remember, we're talking about the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. So when Shays and his militia started shooting, the governor of Massachusetts texted the President of the United States and was like, "Hey boo, what you doing right now? How about you send the national army to help us put down 镇压 this rebellion? LOL." Well, a well-nervous emoji. And what did the president say? Oh wait, this is the Articles of Confederation, so there is no president. There is no national army that can come to help. +

So even though the Massachusetts militia won the conflict 冲突, state leaders started reflecting on 反思；思考 this situation. The economy was bad everywhere, and that probably meant that there were a thousand other Daniel Shays throughout the nation who would rise up 起义；反抗 in rebellion. And what if next time they weren't so easily put down? So all of this shined a bright light on 使……清楚地显现；突出显示 the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation and will lead the nation to begin thinking about the possibility of a new constitution. And that is where we're headed in the next video. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。我们一直在学习 AP 政府课程的第 1 单元，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈《邦联条例》，它可真是一团糟。所以如果你准备好开动脑筋获取知识，那就开始吧。 +
在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释《邦联条例》的关键条款与关于赋予联邦政府原本属于各州的更多权力的辩论之间的关系。好的，那么首先，什么是《邦联条例》呢？嗯，它是本课程中要求你掌握的文件之一，这意味着我有一个完整的视频更详细地探讨它的内容，但现在让我先告诉你一些基本情况。 +
首先，让我们谈谈它的由来。如果你回到 1776 年 7 月，当时美国殖民者宣布脱离英国独立，你会发现这样一种情况，当时他们没有政府，这 13 个州需要创建一个政府。所以每个州都为自己起草了一部宪法，而且这些宪法差异很大，从更具参与性的民主制度到更精英化的民主制度都有。就像我之前说的，这种邦联制政府意味着在美国早期，更像是我们有 13 个独立的政府。 +
但他们很快意识到，为了在国际舞台上处理条约、贸易和其他一些事务，需要有一个中央政府将他们团结在一起，以处理这些任务。这就是《邦联条例》的由来。它是美国的第一部宪法，将这 13 个州联系在一起。而且，关于它从定义上是否真的是一部宪法，还是更像是一个互利的条约存在争议，但不管我们怎么称呼它，它就是一部宪法。 +
由于美国刚刚与英国决裂，我们有点摆脱君主制后的影响，这意味着《邦联条例》建立的政府体系尽可能地远离君主制。在这个政府体系下，各州掌握着大部分权力，而中央政府非常软弱。听着，这是《邦联条例》的一个优点。这个政府当然避免了强大中央政府的暴政。 +
但我要告诉你，尽管有这个优点，《邦联条例》也有很多不足之处。其缺点包括在《邦联条例》下，联邦政府只有一个分支，也就是国会。也就是说，没有行政分支，也没有司法分支。另一个缺点是，为了修改《邦联条例》，需要 13 个州都同意这些改变，委婉地说，这很难做到。我在说你呢，罗德岛（Rhode Island）。 +
另一个缺点是国会没有权力筹集税收收入。就像，如果联邦政府想要税收资金，他们只能好好地请求各州，你可以想象这会怎么样。“丽萨，我能再要一些（税收资金）吗？” [音乐] “想得美。” 你们看到了吧？我的意思是，情况已经到了国会真的无法支付账单的地步。也许其中最重要的账单是他们欠美国独立战争士兵和退伍军人的债务，这将成为一个问题，但我们稍后再详细讨论。 +
但是我们再谈谈联邦国会有多缺钱吧？所以为了解决这个问题，国会在 1828 年提出了一项决议，赋予国会通过征收 5% 关税来筹集资金的权力。这听起来很合理。现在有 11 个州对这个提议表示同意，但弗吉尼亚州有点犹豫不决，然后猜猜谁来了，明确表示不同意？这就是为什么我们不能拥有美好的事物。 +
《邦联条例》的另一个缺点是没有国家货币。所以佐治亚州（Georgia）的货币和纽约州（New York）的不同，纽约州的货币又和弗吉尼亚州（Virginia）的不同。这造成了混乱。最后，我要提到的一个缺点是国会没有权力组建一支国家军队，而这在谢斯起义（Shays' Rebellion）中成为了一个相当严重的问题。 +
现在这个时期的经济，用一个专业术语来说，一团糟。因为国会没有钱，他们没有支付美国独立战争士兵应得的报酬。这对很多人来说是个问题，但对农民来说尤其如此，他们中的许多人在参战期间负债累累。当他们回来时，由于通货膨胀和新的税收，他们在偿还债务方面遇到了很大的困难。那么他们做了什么呢？嗯，这些农民向州政府和联邦政府请愿寻求救济。当然，政府说：“嘿，我们支持军队，如果不是因为你们，我们甚至不会有这个国家，而且如果我们支付了你们应得的报酬，你们也不会负债，所以你们得到了所有你们需要的救济。” 呃，不，他们绝对不是这么说的。相反，政府没有提供任何救济，并且要求这些农民支付他们的税款和债务。 +
毫不奇怪，这让一些农民很生气。碰巧的是，其中一个农民是来自马萨诸塞州（Massachusetts）的丹尼尔・谢斯（Daniel Shays），他认为这些政策完全是胡说八道。所以他组建了一支大约有一千名愤怒农民的民兵队伍。他们前往城镇的兵工厂，突袭了那里，并武装自己进行了一场真正的起义。现在，由此引发的战斗并不是一场激烈的战斗。马萨诸塞州当局召集了他们自己的民兵队伍，基本上镇压了这场起义。 +
那么我为什么要谈论这个呢？因为记住，我们在谈论《邦联条例》的缺点。所以当谢斯和他的民兵开始开枪时，马萨诸塞州州长给美国总统发消息说：“嘿，亲爱的，你现在在做什么？你能不能派国家军队来帮助我们镇压这场起义？哈哈。” 好吧，这是一个很紧张的情况（这里的 “LOL” 表示一种无奈、紧张的情绪）。那么总统说了什么呢？哦，等等，这是《邦联条例》时期，所以没有总统。也没有国家军队可以来帮忙。 +
所以即使马萨诸塞州的民兵赢得了这场冲突，各州的领导人开始反思这种情况。各地的经济都很糟糕，这可能意味着在全国范围内有一千个像丹尼尔・谢斯这样的人会起来反抗。如果下次他们不那么容易被镇压怎么办呢？所以所有这些都凸显了《邦联条例》的缺点，并且会让这个国家开始考虑制定一部新宪法的可能性。这就是我们下一个视频要讲的内容。 +
好的，这就是 AP 政府课程第 1 单元第 4 个 topic 的内容。如果你需要帮助在课堂上得 A 并且在五月份的考试中得 5 分，点击这里获取一份复习资料包。如果你觉得这个视频对你有帮助，并且希望我继续制作更多的视频，那就订阅吧，这样我就知道你希望我继续做下去。海姆勒下线了。 +
