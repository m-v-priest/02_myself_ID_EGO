Well, hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at another one of your required documents 必备文档 for AP Government, namely Federalist 70. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked energetic executive style, then let's get to it. +

Federalist 70, written by Alexander Hamilton, is all about justifying 证明…有理；为…辩护 the need for a single executive 行政长官 or president. During the ratification 批准 debates of the Constitution, Anti-Federalists 反联邦党人 were deeply distressed 苦恼的；忧虑的 by the thought of investing executive power 行政权力 into one guy, because such a proposition 提议 stank of monarchy 君主制. Their proposal, in order to avoid such monarchy, was to have several presidents -- like a council of Executives 行政委员会 -- so that no one of them could usurp power 篡权 and become a tyrant 暴君. +

And so Hamilton comes along in Federalist 70 and says, in summary 总之, yeah, it's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and then goes on to show why a single executive is the best arrangement 安排 for a republic of freedom. +

First and foremost 首先, for Hamilton, the executive must be defined by a single quality 特质, namely energy 活力；效能. He says, "Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government." On the other hand, "a feeble 软弱的；无力的 executive implies a feeble execution of the government." +

Now, what does Hamilton mean by an energetic executive? Well, he means that a single executive will be able to act quickly and decisively 果断地, as opposed to 与…相反 the legislative branch 立法部门, which by its very nature is made up of so many representatives 代表 which have to debate 辩论 and compromise 妥协, and that means it's very deliberate 深思熟虑的 and slow. +

And there are two benefits to this energy: first is unity 统一；团结, and second is responsibility 责任. And with respect to 关于 unity, here's what Hamilton says: "That unity is conducive to 有助于 energy will not be disputed 争论. Decision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch 迅速处理 will generally characterize the proceedings 行动 of one man in a much more eminent 突出的；卓越的 degree than the proceedings of any greater number, and in proportion as the number is increased, these qualities will be diminished 减少." +

So what he's saying here is that the more Executives you have, the less energy of the office -- which is to say, the executive's ability to carry out 执行 the demands of the office -- will be diminished. Hamilton then goes on to prove this from history, pointing out that in nearly every case of a civilization relying on 依赖 multiple Executives, there arose bitter division 严重分歧, and that means the effectiveness 效力 of the office was hindered 阻碍. +

And that would be a massive problem, especially in an emergency 紧急情况, or as Hamilton says it: "If such division should unfortunately assail 困扰 the Supreme executive magistracy 行政长官职位 of a country consisting of a plurality of persons, they might impede 妨碍 or frustrate 挫败 the most important measures of the government in the most critical emergencies of the state. And what is still worse, they might split the community into the most violent and irreconcilable 不可调和的 factions 派别, adhering differently to the different individuals who compose the magistracy." +

Then he goes on to compare the legislature 立法机构 to the executive: in the legislative branch, its chief virtue 优点 is the multitude 众多 of Representatives, which requires them to debate issues and deliberate at length 充分考虑 before any piece of legislation 立法 is passed. And those qualities which are great in the legislative branch constantly counteract 抵消 those qualities in the executive which are the most necessary ingredients 要素 in its composition 构成 -- vigor 活力 and expedition 迅速 -- and this without any counterbalancing good. +

So unity, and the energy and decisiveness it provides, is the first argument 论点 for a single executive. And then the second argument is about the responsibility of the executive. A plan for multiple Executives, Hamilton argues, will conceal 掩盖 faults 错误 and destroy responsibility. Okay, Hamilton, tell us what you mean: "The circumstances 情况 which may have led to any national miscarriage 失败 or misfortune 不幸 are sometimes so complicated that where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency 作用, though we may see clearly upon the whole that there has been mismanagement 管理不善, yet it may be impracticable 不切实际的 to pronounce to whose account the evil 弊病 which may have been incurred 招致 is truly chargeable 应承担责任的." +

In other words 换句话说, if power is abused 滥用 by the executive branch and there are several Executives, it may well be impossible to determine 确定 which of those Executives is at fault 有过错, and therefore who should be held responsible 承担责任. If there is one executive acting like a tyrannical 专横的 turd, then people know exactly who to blame. +

So to summarize 总结: despite the potential 潜在的 dangers of monarchical power 君主权力 that might come from a single president, it's a single executive who will be able to best discharge 履行 the duties of the office with energy and decisiveness. And you know, if the president ends up corrupt 腐败的, there will be no doubt in the people's mind who they need to replace at the next election. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们将看看美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的另一份必学文件，即《联邦党人文集》第70篇（Federalist 70）。所以，如果你准备好以充满活力的行政风格汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

《联邦党人文集》第70篇由亚历山大·汉密尔顿（Alexander Hamilton）撰写，主要是为单一行政长官或总统的必要性进行论证。在宪法批准的辩论中，反联邦党人（Anti-Federalists）一想到将行政权力集中在一个人身上就深感忧虑，因为这样的提议带有君主制的味道。为了避免出现君主制，他们提议设立多个总统，比如一个行政委员会，这样就没人能篡夺权力成为暴君。 +

于是汉密尔顿在《联邦党人文集》第70篇中指出，总的来说，这是他听过的最愚蠢的想法，然后他继续阐述为什么单一行政长官对一个自由共和国来说是最佳安排。 +

首先，对汉密尔顿来说，行政部门必须具备一种特质，即活力。他说：“行政部门的活力是良好政府定义中的一个主要特征。” 另一方面，“软弱的行政部门意味着政府执行不力。” +

那么，汉密尔顿所说的充满活力的行政部门是什么意思呢？嗯，他的意思是，单一行政长官能够迅速而果断地采取行动，而立法部门则不同，立法部门本质上由众多代表组成，他们必须进行辩论和妥协，这意味着立法过程非常慎重且缓慢。 +

这种活力有两个好处：第一是统一性，第二是责任性。关于统一性，汉密尔顿这样说：“统一性有利于增强活力，这一点无可争议。决策、行动力、保密性和迅速性，这些在一个人身上体现的程度通常要比在众多人身上更显著，而且人数越多，这些特质就越弱。” +

所以他的意思是，行政长官的数量越多，行政部门的活力就越弱——也就是说，行政部门执行职务的能力会减弱。然后汉密尔顿从历史角度证明了这一点，他指出，在几乎所有依赖多个行政长官的文明案例中，都会出现激烈的分歧，这意味着行政部门的效率会受到阻碍。 +

这将是一个大问题，尤其是在紧急情况下，或者正如汉密尔顿所说：“如果这种分歧不幸出现在由多个行政长官组成的国家的最高行政机构中，他们可能会在国家最关键的紧急情况下阻碍或挫败政府最重要的措施。更糟糕的是，他们可能会将社会分裂成最激烈、最无法调和的派别，这些派别分别支持组成行政机构的不同个人。” +

然后他继续将立法部门与行政部门进行比较：在立法部门，其主要优点是代表众多，这就要求他们在通过任何立法之前进行辩论和慎重考虑。而这些在立法部门的优点，却不断与行政部门最必要的构成要素——活力和行动力——相冲突，而且没有任何制衡的好处。 +

所以，统一性以及它所带来的活力和果断性，是支持单一行政长官的第一个论点。第二个论点是关于行政部门的责任性。汉密尔顿认为，设立多个行政长官的方案会掩盖错误并破坏责任追究。好吧，汉密尔顿，告诉我们你的意思：“导致国家出现失误或不幸的情况有时非常复杂，当有许多行为者，他们可能有不同程度和类型的职权时，尽管我们从总体上可以清楚地看到存在管理不善的情况，但要确定究竟应由谁来承担所产生的恶果，可能是不可能的。” +

换句话说，如果行政部门滥用权力，而且有多个行政长官，那么很可能无法确定究竟是哪个行政长官的过错，因此也无法确定应由谁来承担责任。如果只有一个行政长官像个专制的混蛋，那么人们就确切地知道该指责谁。 +

所以总结一下：尽管单一总统可能带来君主权力的潜在危险，但单一行政长官能够以活力和果断性更好地履行职务。而且，如果总统最终腐败，人们毫无疑问地知道在下一次选举中该替换谁。 +

好的，这就是《联邦党人文集》第70篇的内容。如果你想在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分，点击这里获取复习资料包。如果你还没有订阅，请订阅，因为这会向我发送继续为你制作视频的信号。下次见，我是卢（Lou）。 +

Well, hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at another one of your required documents for AP Government, namely Federalist 70. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked energetic executive style, then let's get to it.

Federalist 70, written by Alexander Hamilton, is all about justifying the need for a single executive or president. During the ratification debates of the Constitution, Anti-Federalists were deeply distressed by the thought of investing executive power into one guy, because such a proposition stank of monarchy. Their proposal, in order to avoid such monarchy, was to have several presidents -- like a council of Executives -- so that no one of them could usurp power and become a tyrant.

And so Hamilton comes along in Federalist 70 and says, in summary, yeah, it's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and then goes on to show why a single executive is the best arrangement for a republic of freedom.

First and foremost, for Hamilton, the executive must be defined by a single quality, namely energy. He says, "Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government." On the other hand, "a feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the government."

Now, what does Hamilton mean by an energetic executive? Well, he means that a single executive will be able to act quickly and decisively, as opposed to the legislative branch, which by its very nature is made up of so many representatives which have to debate and compromise, and that means it's very deliberate and slow.

And there are two benefits to this energy: first is unity, and second is responsibility. And with respect to unity, here's what Hamilton says: "That unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed. Decision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the proceedings of any greater number, and in proportion as the number is increased, these qualities will be diminished."

So what he's saying here is that the more Executives you have, the less energy of the office -- which is to say, the executive's ability to carry out the demands of the office -- will be diminished. Hamilton then goes on to prove this from history, pointing out that in nearly every case of a civilization relying on multiple Executives, there arose bitter division, and that means the effectiveness of the office was hindered.

And that would be a massive problem, especially in an emergency, or as Hamilton says it: "If such division should unfortunately assail the Supreme executive magistracy of a country consisting of a plurality of persons, they might impede or frustrate the most important measures of the government in the most critical emergencies of the state. And what is still worse, they might split the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions, adhering differently to the different individuals who compose the magistracy."

And those qualities which are great in the legislative branch constantly counteract those qualities in the executive which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition -- vigor and expedition -- and this without any counterbalancing good.

So unity, and the energy and decisiveness it provides, is the first argument for a single executive. And then the second argument is about the responsibility of the executive. A plan for multiple Executives, Hamilton argues, will conceal faults and destroy responsibility. Okay, Hamilton, tell us what you mean: "The circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency, though we may see clearly upon the whole that there has been mismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable."

In other words, if power is abused by the executive branch and there are several Executives, it may well be impossible to determine which of those Executives is at fault, and therefore who should be held responsible. If there is one executive acting like a tyrannical turd, then people know exactly who to blame.

So to summarize: despite the potential dangers of monarchical power that might come from a single president, it's a single executive who will be able to best discharge the duties of the office with energy and decisiveness. And you know, if the president ends up corrupt, there will be no doubt in the people's mind who they need to replace at the next election.
