Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at another one of your required 必修的 Supreme Court cases for the AP Government curriculum 教学大纲, namely Tinker v. Des Moines. So if you're ready to get them brain cells milked 挤出来 (幽默：开动脑筋), let's get to it. +

And you know, this is a really interesting case for high schoolers 高中生 because it very much set the parameters 范围 for the freedom of speech 言论自由 that you have on school property 学校财产. Okay, as always, let's begin with the facts of the case 案件事实. In 1965, Senator Robert Kennedy 罗伯特·肯尼迪 called for a Christmas truce 圣诞停战协议 in the war in Vietnam 越南战争, and an activist 激进分子 family called the Tinkers decided they wanted to support this controversial measure in symbolic protest 象征性抗议. To that end, four of their children and one of their friends made a plan to wear black armbands 黑色臂章 to school in support of the Christmas truce. +

Now to put it mildly, the nation was a piping hot mess 极度混乱的状态 regarding the Vietnam War. There were protests 抗议 and violence 暴力, and so this was very much not a neutral issue. So when the school administration heard about the Tinkers' plan, they went ahead and wrote a policy 政策 saying that any student wearing a protest armband 抗议臂章 to school would be asked to remove it or face suspension 停学 until they were willing to come back to school without it. And so the Tinker children decided to wear the armbands anyway, and they got suspended 停学, upon which their parents filed suit 提起诉讼. +

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake? This was a case about the First Amendment 第一修正案's protection of free speech 言论自由. Now remember what I've been saying in all these videos on civil liberties 公民自由 -- our rights are not absolute 绝对的. There are limits to them, and the question here is whether a student protest 学生抗议 on school property 学校财产, silent 沉默的 and symbolic 象征性的 as it was concerning a highly contentious 有争议的 issue, should be allowed. After all, school administrators do have the responsibility to create a good learning environment as free from conflict as possible. And so was this particular prohibition 禁止 from the administration a reasonable infringement 侵犯 on the student's right to free speech? +

Well to answer the question, let's see how the case was decided. In a 7-2 decision, the court ruled that this was a violation of the student's right to free speech 言论自由. And while the court acknowledged that there were valid 合法的 constitutional reasons for an administration to restrict the speech of students on some occasions, this case did not meet the criteria 标准. In fact, the court created what's called the substantial disruption test 实质性干扰测试 as a decision-making criterion for how school administrators could constitutionally limit student speech. +

Basically it just says that if a school administration is going to restrict student speech, they must be able to demonstrate that the speech in question would, quote, "materially and substantially interfere 干扰 with the requirements of appropriate discipline 纪律 in the operation of the school." And since the wearing of these armbands caused no material or substantial disruption, it was deemed a violation of the student's First Amendment rights. That's because as Justice Abe Fortas 阿贝·福塔斯法官 stated in the majority opinion, "It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights 宪法权利 to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." +

Okay, now why does this case matter? It matters because it set the parameters 范围 for the question of free speech 言论自由 on school campuses 学校校园 and has been cited in many other similar cases to guide justices in their ruling. Before you decide to just go say anything you want at school thinking Tinker will protect you, I should mention that subsequent cases have refined 精炼 the relationship between students' free speech and the school administration's responsibility to create a conflict-free learning environment. +

For example, in 1985, a case called Bethel School District v. Fraser 贝瑟尔学区诉弗雷泽案 took up the question about obscene 淫秽的 and vulgar 粗俗的 speech at school. In this case, a student gave a speech that was overflowing with sexual innuendos 性暗示 and was disciplined as a result. So in this case, the court decided that vulgar speech 粗俗的言论 on a school campus was not the same as political speech 政治言论 like the students in the Tinker case had engaged in, and so they ruled in favor of the administration in that case, and thus decided that there are legitimate 合理的 restrictions on student speech. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个最高法院的必学案例，也就是 “廷克诉得梅因案”（Tinker v. Des Moines）。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

你知道，这个案例对高中生来说真的很有趣，因为它在很大程度上设定了学生在学校范围内的言论自由的界限。好的，和往常一样，我们先来看这个案件的事实。1965年，参议员罗伯特·肯尼迪（Robert Kennedy）呼吁在越南战争中实行圣诞节休战，一个名叫廷克（Tinker）的激进家庭决定以象征性的抗议方式支持这一有争议的措施。为此，他们家的四个孩子和他们的一个朋友计划戴着黑色臂章去学校，以支持圣诞节休战。 +

委婉地说，当时美国在越南战争问题上一片混乱。抗议活动不断，还发生了暴力事件，所以这绝不是一个中立的问题。当学校管理部门听说了廷克家孩子的计划后，他们随后制定了一项政策，规定任何戴着抗议臂章上学的学生都将被要求摘下臂章，否则将被停课，直到他们愿意不戴臂章回到学校。所以廷克家的孩子们还是决定戴着臂章上学，然后他们被停课了，于是他们的父母提起了诉讼。 +

那么这个案件所涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？这是一个关于第一修正案（First Amendment）对言论自由保护的案件。记住我在所有关于公民自由的视频里说过的话——我们的权利不是绝对的。这些权利是有界限的，这里的问题是，学生在学校范围内的抗议活动，尽管是无声且具有象征意义的，但就一个极具争议的问题而言，是否应该被允许。毕竟，学校管理人员有责任营造一个尽可能没有冲突的良好学习环境。那么学校管理部门的这一特定禁令是否合理地侵犯了学生的言论自由权呢？ +

嗯，为了回答这个问题，我们来看看这个案件的裁决。法院以7比2的裁决判定，这侵犯了学生的言论自由权。虽然法院承认学校管理部门在某些情况下有合理的宪法理由限制学生的言论，但这个案件并不符合这些理由。事实上，法院创建了所谓的 “实质性干扰测试”（substantial disruption test），作为学校管理人员在宪法层面限制学生言论的决策标准。 +

基本上，这意味着如果学校管理部门要限制学生的言论，他们必须能够证明所涉及的言论 “在学校运营中实质性且重大地干扰了适当纪律的要求”。由于佩戴这些臂章并没有造成实质性的干扰，所以这被认定为侵犯了学生的第一修正案权利。这是因为正如阿贝·福塔斯（Abe Fortas）大法官在多数意见中所说：“很难说学生或教师在学校门口就放弃了他们的言论或表达的宪法权利。” +

好的，那么这个案件为什么重要呢？它很重要，因为它设定了校园内言论自由问题的界限，并且在许多其他类似案件中被引用，以指导大法官们做出裁决。在你决定在学校想说什么就说什么，以为 “廷克案” 会保护你之前，我得说，后续的案件完善了学生言论自由与学校管理部门营造无冲突学习环境的责任之间的关系。 +

例如，1985年，一个名为 “贝瑟尔学区诉弗雷泽案”（Bethel School District v. Fraser）的案件探讨了学校里淫秽和粗俗言论的问题。在这个案件中，一名学生发表了充满性暗示的演讲，结果受到了处分。所以在这个案件中，法院判定校园里的粗俗言论与 “廷克案” 中学生所进行的政治言论不同，所以他们做出了有利于学校管理部门的裁决，因此判定对学生言论的限制是合理的。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的 “廷克诉得梅因案”（Tinker v. Des Moines）。如果你想在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分，点击这里获取复习资料包。嘿，如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，那就点击订阅按钮来表达你象征性言论的权利吧，我会照做的。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +
