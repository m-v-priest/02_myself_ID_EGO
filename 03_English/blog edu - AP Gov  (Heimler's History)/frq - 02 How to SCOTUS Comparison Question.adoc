Hey there, welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, I'm going to show you how to get a perfect score on your SCOTUS comparison FRQ 美国最高法院案例比较自由回答问题（Free - Response Question）for AP Government. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

Okay, so first of all, just in case you don't know, SCOTUS is short for 是…的缩写 Supreme Court of the United States 美国最高法院. So this question is all about comparing a SCOTUS case that you don't know with a SCOTUS case you do know -- or you know, you're supposed to know. If you don't know what cases you're supposed to know, then I've got a whole playlist covering each of them, so get your clicky finger out and have a look. +

Anyway, when you get to this question, you're going to see a written stimulus 材料, and that's going to be the summary of the case that you have not studied. And apparently enough students have freaked out 惊慌失措 at this point that they tell you right up front 提前: you're not supposed to know this case, so just chill your beans 放松；别紧张 and be at peace. +

Now before we get into this question, let me give you some general advice on answering it. After the stimulus, you'll see three parts of the question labeled A, B, and C. And the advice I have for the SCOTUS comparison question is the same I have for the concept application 概念应用 and the quantitative data question 定量数据问题: for each of those prompts 题目, you need to write your answers in complete sentences 完整句子. Don't just throw a single word in there or write in bullet points 要点列表. +

And then if the prompt begins with the word "identify 识别；指出", you really only need one sentence naming what they're asking for. If you see a prompt beginning with any other word like "explain 解释" or "describe 描述", then you're gonna need a little more, and the general rule of thumb 经验法则 is two to three content - rich sentences 内容丰富的句子. And remember two things: be specific with your evidence 证据具体, and always relate it back to the prompt 紧扣题目. +

And now let me give you some advice specific to this question. If you watch my videos on the required cases 必学案例, you'll notice there's always a four - part structure 四部分结构: the facts of the case 案件事实, the constitutional principle at stake 相关宪法原则, the decision 判决, and the impact of the case 案件影响. I do that because those are the four things you need to know in order to answer this question and earn full points. +

Okay, so let's look at an example of this question from the 2019 AP Government exam. The first thing you'll see is the stimulus, and for the sake of time 为节省时间, I'll just give you the basic gist 要点: In the 1950s, Pete Hernandez, a Mexican - American agricultural worker 农业工人, was found guilty of murder 被判谋杀罪 and sentenced to life in prison 判处终身监禁 by an all - white jury 全白人陪审团 in Jackson County, Texas. The five jury commissioners 陪审团专员 testified under oath 宣誓作证 that they selected jurors 挑选陪审员 based only on their qualifications 资格 and did not consider race or national origin 种族或民族出身 in their decisions. In the ensuing case Hernandez v. Texas 在随后的埃尔南德斯诉得克萨斯州案中, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Hernandez 最高法院一致作出对埃尔南德斯有利的裁决, deciding that evidence of discrimination against Mexican Americans 对墨西哥裔美国人的歧视存在 existed in Jackson County and that the Constitution prohibits such discrimination 宪法禁止此类歧视. +

Okay, so that's the description of the case you don't know, and now they're going to ask you to compare it with a case that you are required to know. So look at part A: "Identify the clause 条款 in the 14th Amendment 第十四修正案 that was used as the basis for the decision both in Brown v. Board of Education 布朗诉教育委员会案 and in Hernandez v. Texas." Okay, so they go ahead and tell you that the amendment both of these cases have in common 共同的 is the 14th Amendment, but your job is to produce the clause that they share in common, and that -- in case you don't know -- is the Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款. +

So since it just asked you to identify the clause, your answer would be: "The clause of the 14th Amendment both cases have in common is the Equal Protection Clause." Alright, done, earned the point. And again, there isn't any other heavy lifting 繁重工作 you have to do in this question as far as complex reasoning 复杂推理 goes. Either you know Brown and Hernandez were based on the Equal Protection Clause or you don't. +

You know, there really are two ways to get to that answer. First, you can just have that fact about Brown v. Board of Education tucked 深藏 somewhere away in your brain folds 大脑褶皱, and since this question asks you about the clause for Brown, you already know it. Or if that knowledge has somehow leaked out of your brain 从大脑中消失, you can reason your way there from the stimulus. Okay, this is a case about racial discrimination 种族歧视. What clause in the 14th Amendment was brought up over and over and over in my class about racial discrimination? Oh, the Equal Protection Clause. It doesn't matter how you get there, just as long as you get there. +

Okay, now let's look at part B: "Explain how the facts in both Brown v. Board of Education and Hernandez v. Texas led to a similar decision in both cases." Now before I show you the answer, notice that this question is asking you to do more than the previous question. It's asking you to do two things, namely 即 explain the facts of both cases and how they led to similar decisions. That means that the question is worth two points, not just one. So if they ask you to do two things, it will always be worth two points. +

Okay, here's an answer that earns both points for this question: "Brown was about segregated schools/racial discrimination in schools 学校种族隔离. In Brown, segregated schools led to discrimination against African - American students, which was a violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause 违反宪法平等保护条款. In Hernandez, discrimination against Mexican - Americans in jury service 陪审团服务中的歧视 was found to be a violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause because it led to the conviction of Hernandez by a jury that excluded Mexican Americans 导致埃尔南德斯被一个排除墨西哥裔美国人的陪审团定罪." +

So notice here that one point is awarded for correctly describing a fact from the required case here. And you might object and say, "Wait a minute, it says that you have to talk about the facts for both cases." That's true, but you only get the point for describing a fact from the required case because the other case has all the facts right there for you to read anyway. The answer earns the second point for demonstrating 证明 how both cases dealt with discrimination against minorities 处理对少数族裔的歧视 and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause. +

Okay, now we just earned another two points, so let's look at part C: "Explain how an interest group 利益集团 could use the decision in Hernandez v. Texas to advance its agenda 推进其议程." Okay, now they've taken you out of the realm of 超出…范围 comparing these two cases and they want you to bring other concepts of the course into it -- in this case, interest groups and how they might use this decision to advance its agenda. +

Okay, now let me show you a student answer to this question that earns the point: "An interest group could use the decision as a precedent 先例 and bring another trial case to a court in order to secure more strict guidelines on how a jury is picked 挑选陪审团 and how to prevent this de facto 事实上的 or de jure 法律上的 segregation 隔离. They could also write amicus curiae briefs 法庭之友意见书 for the Supreme Court on future cases in which they cite 引用 the decision Hernandez v. Texas as the reason for the court to rule a certain way. Each action can result in a decision that affects public policy 影响公共政策 and fulfills the interest group's agenda 实现利益集团的议程." +

Now this answer definitely earns the point and actually goes way overboard 做得过头. Notice that the answer identifies a strategy interest groups could use -- in this case, two strategies: bring another case to court or write amicus curiae briefs. And the answer also shows the outcome of that act 行为的结果, namely stricter guidelines on how a jury is picked. And then further, notice at the end the student tied the answer back to the prompt 紧扣题目. Always, always, always tie your answer back to the prompt. +

So if you do all that, you will no doubt earn a perfect score on the SCOTUS comparison question.

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我将向你展示如何在美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中，在关于美国最高法院（Supreme Court of the United States，简称SCOTUS）案例比较的自由回答问题（FRQ）中拿到满分。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

好的，首先，以防你不知道，SCOTUS 是美国最高法院的缩写。所以这个问题是关于将一个你不了解的美国最高法院案例与一个你应该了解的美国最高法院案例进行比较。如果你不知道你应该了解哪些案例，我有一整个播放列表涵盖了每一个案例，所以动动你的手指去看看吧。 +

不管怎样，当你看到这个问题时，你会看到一段文字材料，这将是对一个你没有学过的案例的总结。显然，很多学生在看到这个问题时会惊慌失措，所以他们会提前告诉你：你不需要了解这个案例，所以冷静下来，别紧张。 +

现在，在我们深入这个问题之前，让我给你一些回答这个问题的一般性建议。在看到材料之后，你会看到问题的三个部分，分别标记为 A、B 和 C。我对美国最高法院案例比较问题的建议，和我对概念应用问题以及定量数据问题的建议是一样的：对于每一个提示，你需要用完整的句子来回答。不要只写一个单词，也不要用要点的形式来写。 +

然后，如果提示以 “identify（识别、确定）” 这个词开头，你只需要用一个句子说出他们所要求的内容。如果提示以其他单词开头，比如 “explain（解释）” 或 “describe（描述）”，那么你需要写得更多一些，一般的经验法则是写两到三个内容丰富的句子。记住两件事：具体说明你的证据，并且始终将其与提示联系起来。 +

现在，让我给你一些针对这个问题的具体建议。如果你看了我关于必学案例的视频，你会注意到案例总是有四个部分的结构：案件事实、所涉及的宪法原则、判决结果以及案件的影响。我这样做是因为这四个方面是你为了回答这个问题并拿到满分所需要知道的。 +

好的，让我们来看一个 2019 年美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程考试中这个问题的例子。你首先会看到材料，为了节省时间，我只告诉你基本要点：在 20 世纪 50 年代，墨西哥裔美国农业工人皮特·埃尔南德斯（Pete Hernandez）被判谋杀罪，得克萨斯州杰克逊县（Jackson County, Texas）一个全是白人的陪审团判处他终身监禁。五名陪审团专员宣誓作证，称他们只根据陪审员的资格来挑选陪审员，在他们的决定中没有考虑种族或国籍因素。在随后的埃尔南德斯诉得克萨斯州案（Hernandez v. Texas）中，最高法院一致做出有利于埃尔南德斯的裁决，认定杰克逊县存在对墨西哥裔美国人的歧视证据，并且宪法禁止这种歧视。 +

好的，这是对一个你不了解的案例的描述，现在他们会要求你将其与一个你需要了解的案例进行比较。所以看 A 部分：“确定在布朗诉教育委员会案（Brown v. Board of Education）和埃尔南德斯诉得克萨斯州案（Hernandez v. Texas）中，作为判决依据的第十四修正案（14th Amendment）中的条款。” 好的，所以他们会告诉你，这两个案例共同涉及的修正案是第十四修正案，但你的任务是说出它们共同涉及的条款，万一你不知道，这个条款就是平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）。 +

所以，既然问题只是要求你确定条款，你的答案应该是：“第十四修正案中这两个案例共同涉及的条款是平等保护条款。” 好了，完成，拿到分数。再说一次，就复杂推理而言，在这个问题中你不需要做其他更难的事情。要么你知道布朗案和埃尔南德斯案都是基于平等保护条款，要么你不知道。 +

你知道，要得到这个答案其实有两种方法。首先，你可以把关于布朗诉教育委员会案的这个事实记在脑海里，既然这个问题问的是布朗案的条款，你就已经知道答案了。或者，如果这个知识不知怎么从你的脑海中溜走了，你可以根据材料进行推理得出答案。好的，这是一个关于种族歧视的案例。在我的课上，关于种族歧视，第十四修正案中的哪个条款被反复提及呢？哦，是平等保护条款。你通过什么方式得出答案并不重要，只要你能答对就行。 +

好的，现在让我们看 B 部分：“解释布朗诉教育委员会案（Brown v. Board of Education）和埃尔南德斯诉得克萨斯州案（Hernandez v. Texas）中的事实是如何导致两个案件有相似判决的。” 在我给你展示答案之前，注意这个问题要求你做的比上一个问题更多。它要求你做两件事，即解释两个案件的事实，以及这些事实是如何导致相似判决的。这意味着这个问题值两分，而不只是一分。所以如果他们要求你做两件事，这个问题总是值两分。 +

好的，这是一个能得到这个问题两分的答案：“布朗案是关于学校种族隔离/学校中的种族歧视。在布朗案中，种族隔离的学校导致了对非裔美国学生的歧视，这违反了宪法的平等保护条款。在埃尔南德斯案中，在陪审团服务中对墨西哥裔美国人的歧视被认定违反了宪法的平等保护条款，因为这导致了由一个排除墨西哥裔美国人的陪审团对埃尔南德斯的定罪。” +

所以注意，正确描述必学案例中的一个事实可以得一分。你可能会反对说：“等一下，题目说你必须谈论两个案件的事实。” 没错，但你描述必学案例中的一个事实就能得分，因为另一个案例的所有事实就在那里供你阅读。这个答案得到第二分是因为它展示了两个案件是如何处理对少数族裔的歧视，从而违反了平等保护条款。 +

好的，现在我们又得了两分，让我们看 C 部分：“解释一个利益集团如何利用埃尔南德斯诉得克萨斯州案（Hernandez v. Texas）的判决来推进其议程。” 好的，现在他们把你带出了比较这两个案件的范围，他们希望你引入课程中的其他概念 —— 在这种情况下，就是利益集团以及它们如何利用这个判决来推进其议程。 +

好的，现在让我给你展示一个能得到这一分的学生答案：“一个利益集团可以将这个判决作为先例，向法院提起另一个审判案件，以便就如何挑选陪审团以及如何防止事实上或法律上的种族隔离制定更严格的指导方针。他们还可以为最高法院撰写法庭之友简报（amicus curiae briefs），在未来的案件中，他们引用埃尔南德斯诉得克萨斯州案的判决作为法院以某种方式裁决的理由。每一个行动都可能导致一个影响公共政策并实现利益集团议程的判决。” +

现在这个答案肯定能得分，而且实际上写得非常好。注意，这个答案确定了利益集团可以使用的一种策略 —— 在这种情况下，是两种策略：向法院提起另一个案件或撰写法庭之友简报。而且这个答案还展示了这种行动的结果，即关于如何挑选陪审团的更严格指导方针。然后进一步注意，在最后学生将答案与提示联系了起来。一定要始终将你的答案与提示联系起来。 +

所以，如果你做到了这些，你无疑会在美国最高法院案例比较问题上拿到满分。好的，我希望这对你有帮助，如果你在美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中还需要更多帮助，那么点击这里获取我的终极复习资料包，它将帮助你在课堂上取得 A 的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得 5 分。点击这里查看我关于如何在本课程的自由回答问题（FRQ）中取得好成绩的其他视频。如果你从这个视频中得到了帮助，并且希望我继续制作这样的视频，那么一定要订阅，我会照做的。海姆勒，退出。 +
