Hey there, and welcome back to Heimlich's History. Now we've been going through Unit 5 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video that means it's time to talk about campaign finance 竞选资金. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a metric butt load of （俚语，大量的） corporate free speech 企业言论自由, let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain how the organization, finance 资金运作, and strategies 策略 of national political campaigns 全国政治竞选活动 affect the election process 选举过程. Now in the last video, we talked about how modern political campaigns are mind-blowingly 令人难以置信地 expensive compared to previous decades. Over 14 billion dollars was spent on the most recent presidential election. But despite the growing cost of campaigns, there has been a growing body of regulatory laws 监管法律 and debates over the role that money ought to play in campaigns. +

Now the main part of the story here begins in 1974 with the passage of the Federal Elections Campaign Act, or FECA 联邦选举竞选法案. This law created a new federal commission 联邦委员会 called the Federal Election Commission 联邦选举委员会, which was created to oversee and regulate 监督和管理 the money being spent in political campaigns 政治竞选活动中的资金支出. Now as a result of these two things, there were limits established 设定限制 for how much a person could give to a political candidate 个人向政治候选人捐款数额 and how much money a candidate could spend on their campaign 候选人竞选支出数额. +

Now let me say that again because it's important to understand that there are two realities that we're dealing with: first is how much money can be given to a candidate, and second is how much that candidate can spend on their campaign. Now the reason why this is a big deal 重要的事 is because of the non-required Supreme Court case 最高法院案件 called Buckley v. Valeo in 1976. The court took up 审理 this limitation of spending 支出限制 and ruled 裁决 that spending money on political campaigns is tightly tied to 与…紧密相连 the First Amendment's 第一修正案 protection of the freedom of speech 言论自由保护. +

And you're like, what? Like how is spending money on campaigns related to free speech? Well it's not that hard to understand. Like if you want to share your endorsement 支持 for a candidate with the people around you, you have the freedom to do so. But what if you want to share that endorsement with more than the people around you? What if you want to share it with everyone in America? Well you could visit every household in the nation and say it with your mouth hole, but just in case you want to finish that task in fewer than 700 years, you're probably going to have to spend money and make advertisements. You need to make ads for television and online sources 网络平台 and social media, and that is very expensive. +

So you can see that if there was a law capping 限制 how much you could spend to make those advertisements, that would be the equivalent of 等同于 restricting your freedom of speech. And that's the part about how much a candidate can spend on their campaign. But the case also took up the related problem of how much an individual could give to a candidate. If there are no limits on how much a person or group can spend on a campaign, then that might create a problem. In a system like that, who has the loudest voice? Well it's the one with the most money. It's kind of like the list of commandments 戒律 in Animal Farm （《动物庄园》）, the last of which says all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others. +

So yes, technically speaking 从技术层面上讲, we all have equal access to free speech 平等享有言论自由. But if money equals speech -- at least in politics -- then there are some folks that are more equal than others. And so what the court did in the Buckley decision 巴克利案裁决 was a little complicated, but stick with me 跟上我思路. Basically what the court did was to uphold 支持 the part of the law that restricted the amount of money an individual could contribute to a candidate 个人向候选人捐款限额. That in their opinion was the key to a free and fair election 自由公平选举的关键. However, they did strike down 废除 the part of the law that restricted how much a candidate could spend on their campaign. That kind of restriction was deemed 被认为 a violation of the First Amendment 违反第一修正案. +

Okay, so thankfully after that, the matter of campaign finance was settled. Except that it wasn't, because politics makes people crazy and they found a way around these limitations 绕过这些限制. And for this I need to explain the difference between hard money 硬钱 and soft money 软钱. Hard money describes contributions given directly to a candidate 直接捐给候选人的款项. That's the kind of money that was being restricted and regulated in all the legislation I just mentioned. But if you want to give more money than you are able to by law, well soft money is the way to go 可行的办法. This is money donated not directly to a candidate but to a party or an interest group who could then buy advertising or whatever on the candidate's behalf 代表候选人, and that was not subject to campaign finance law 不受竞选资金法约束. +

So there's a loophole 漏洞, we'd better close it up. And that happened in 2002 with the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, or BCRA 两党竞选改革法案. This law increased the amount of hard money that could be donated to a candidate 提高个人向候选人捐赠硬钱的限额 and made provisions 作出规定 to regulate and make transparent 监管并透明化 the amount of soft money that could be given as well. Another provision 条款 in BCRA was the "stand by your ad" provision of the law. If you've ever seen a political ad, you know what I'm talking about. Like at the end of the ads, the candidate has to say, "I'm whatever the name is and I approve this message. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message." The hope here was that if a candidate was required to attach their name and face to an ad 广告中标明身份, then the amount of negative advertising 负面广告 -- which was rampant 猖獗的 during that time -- would decrease. +

And then everybody was happy. Except they weren't. And that brings us to a required case you need to know from 2010, namely Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission 联合公民诉联邦选举委员会案. So remember in the Buckley case, the court ruled that limits on individual and corporate contributions to campaigns were constitutional 合宪的, but limits on how much a campaign could spend were unconstitutional 违宪的. The Citizens United case challenged the limits placed upon individuals and corporations for campaign contributions 质疑对个人和企业竞选捐款的限制. They argued that BCRA's limitations amounted to 等同于 a violation of free speech. Like if a corporation or other entity 实体 wants to spend money to endorse a candidate, they should be able to do so in unlimited measure 无限制地进行. +

And in this case, the court ruled that the limits on contributions from individuals and corporations was a violation of free speech 个人和企业捐款限额违反言论自由. Therefore, corporate funding of ads and broadcasts cannot be limited 企业对广告和广播的资助不得受限. The upshot of this decision 该裁决的结果 was this: political spending by corporations or associations or labor unions 企业、协会或工会的政治支出 is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment 受第一修正案保护的言论形式. And that brings us right back to the old problem. Like if corporations have no limits on the money that they can spend for political purposes 政治目的, then the richest of them will dominate the conversation 主导话语权. Remember, money equals influence in politics 金钱在政治中等于影响力. So that means that a very small percentage of the population -- that is to say those with enormous amounts of money -- are directing the political conversation 主导政治讨论. At least that's how the critics of the ruling argue 裁决的批评者这样认为. +

Now not surprisingly, since the Citizens United decision, the increase in campaign contributions 竞选捐款增长 has gone off the charts 急剧上升. And there are a lot of entities spending money on politics, but I just want to focus on one kind of organization called a Political Action Committee 政治行动委员会, more commonly known as a PAC. These are organizations that raise money for the sake of 为了 influencing the population to vote for their preferred candidate 影响民众投票给他们支持的候选人, and there are three kinds that I want you to know. +

First are connected PACs 关联政治行动委员会, and those are formed by corporations or other entities like labor unions 工会. It's a PAC that's connected to these organizations. So connected PACs can only collect funds from the members of their organization 只能从组织成员处筹集资金, and that money can be donated directly to candidates in limited quantities 向候选人直接捐款数额有限. However, they can raise unlimited amounts of money provided the individual limits are obeyed 只要遵守个人捐款限额, 可筹集不限量资金. +

Second are non-connected PACs 非关联政治行动委员会, which are formed independently of an organization 独立于任何组织成立, usually around a specific public interest 围绕特定公共利益 like gun rights or women in politics. Again as in connected PACs, donations to non-connected PACs are limited by law 向非关联政治行动委员会的捐款受法律限制. They can accept donations from anyone in the public 可接受公众任何人捐款 and donate directly to candidates 直接向候选人捐款. +

Third are super PACs 超级政治行动委员会, which have proliferated widely 大量涌现 since the Citizens United decision. Super PACs can be formed by anyone, can accept unlimited donations 接受不限额捐款, but cannot directly coordinate with the candidate 不能与候选人直接协调. And these are the most controversial kind of PACs 最具争议的政治行动委员会 because critics argue that super PACs have the potential to limit democracy 限制民主 and give voice only to the wealthy 只让富人发声. And there we are right back again to the free speech problem 言论自由问题. +

So all this to say, campaign finance has been hotly contested 激烈争论 in the last 50 years, and it's hard to know if things have gotten better or if things have gotten worse during that time. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimlich 应为 Heimler）的历史频道。目前我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第五单元，在这个视频中，我们要谈谈竞选资金。所以，如果你准备好结合大量企业的言论自由来激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释全国政治竞选的组织、资金和策略如何影响选举过程。在上一个视频中，我们谈到现代政治竞选与过去几十年相比花费高得令人难以置信。最近的总统选举花费超过了140亿美元。但是，尽管竞选成本不断增加，关于资金在竞选中应扮演的角色，相关的监管法律在增多，争议也在增多。 +

现在，这里故事的主要部分始于1974年《联邦选举竞选法案》（Federal Elections Campaign Act，FECA）的通过。这项法律创建了一个新的联邦委员会，即联邦选举委员会（Federal Election Commission），其创建目的是监督和管理政治竞选活动中的资金使用情况。由于这两项举措，对个人能给政治候选人的捐款数额以及候选人在竞选活动中能花费的金额都设定了限制。 +

我再重申一下，因为理解这两个现实很重要：第一是个人能给候选人的捐款数额，第二是候选人能在竞选活动中花费的金额。这之所以很关键，是因为1976年有一个名为 “巴克利诉瓦莱奥案”（Buckley v. Valeo）的最高法院强制性案件。法院审理了对竞选支出的限制问题，并裁定在政治竞选中的支出与美国宪法第一修正案所保护的言论自由紧密相关。 +

你可能会想，什么？在竞选中花钱怎么会和言论自由有关呢？其实这并不难理解。比如，如果你想向周围的人表达你对某个候选人的支持，你有这样做的自由。但是，如果你想向比周围人更多的人表达这种支持呢？如果你想向美国的所有人表达呢？嗯，你可以走访这个国家的每一个家庭，亲口说出你的支持，但如果你想在少于700年的时间里完成这项任务，你可能就得花钱去制作广告。你需要在电视、网络和社交媒体上投放广告，而这非常昂贵。 +

所以你可以看到，如果有一项法律限制你制作这些广告的花费，那就相当于限制了你的言论自由。这就是关于候选人能在竞选活动中花费多少钱的部分。但这个案件也涉及到个人能给候选人捐款数额的相关问题。如果对个人或团体在竞选中的花费没有限制，那就可能会产生问题。在这样的体系中，谁的声音最大呢？嗯，是那些最有钱的人。这有点像《动物农场》（Animal Farm）里的戒律，最后一条戒律说所有动物都是平等的，但有些动物比其他动物更平等。 +

所以，从技术层面讲，我们都有平等的言论自由权。但如果金钱等于言论——至少在政治领域是这样——那么就会有一些人比其他人更有优势。所以最高法院在 “巴克利案” 中的裁决有点复杂，但请跟上我的思路。基本上，法院支持法律中限制个人给候选人捐款数额的部分。在他们看来，这是实现自由公正选举的关键。然而，他们否决了法律中限制候选人竞选支出数额的部分。这种限制被认为违反了美国宪法第一修正案。 +

好的，谢天谢地，在那之后，竞选资金的问题得到了解决。但其实并没有，因为政治让人疯狂，人们找到了绕过这些限制的方法。为此，我需要解释一下 “硬钱”（hard money）和 “软钱”（soft money）的区别。“硬钱” 指的是直接给候选人的捐款。这就是我刚才提到的所有立法中被限制和监管的那种资金。但是，如果你想捐出比法律允许的更多的钱，那么 “软钱” 就是一种途径。“软钱” 是指不直接捐给候选人，而是捐给一个政党或利益团体的钱，这些团体可以代表候选人购买广告或其他东西，并且这种资金不受竞选资金法的约束。 +

所以存在一个漏洞，我们最好把它补上。这在2002年随着《两党竞选改革法案》（Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act，BCRA）的通过得以实现。这项法律提高了可以捐给候选人的 “硬钱” 数额，并且制定了规定来监管和公开可以捐赠的 “软钱” 数额。《两党竞选改革法案》中的另一个条款是 “为你的广告负责” 的规定。如果你看过政治广告，就知道我在说什么。比如在广告的结尾，候选人必须说，“我是某某某，我批准这条广告。我是特德·克鲁兹（Ted Cruz），我批准这条广告。” 这样做的期望是，如果要求候选人在广告上附上自己的名字和形象，那么当时盛行的负面广告的数量就会减少。 +

然后大家都很高兴。但实际上并非如此。这就引出了一个你需要了解的2010年的强制性案件，即 “联合公民组织诉联邦选举委员会案”（Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission）。还记得在 “巴克利案” 中，法院裁定对个人和企业向竞选活动捐款的限制是符合宪法的，但对竞选支出的限制是违宪的。“联合公民组织案” 对个人和企业在竞选捐款方面的限制提出了挑战。他们认为《两党竞选改革法案》的限制相当于侵犯了言论自由。比如，如果一个企业或其他实体想花钱支持某个候选人，他们应该能够无限制地这样做。 +

在这个案件中，法院裁定对个人和企业捐款的限制侵犯了言论自由。因此，企业对广告和广播的资助不能被限制。这个裁决的结果是：企业、协会或工会的政治支出是美国宪法第一修正案所保护的一种言论形式。这又让我们回到了原来的问题。如果企业在政治目的上的支出没有限制，那么最富有的企业将主导政治讨论。记住，在政治中，金钱等于影响力。所以这意味着，人口中极小一部分人——也就是那些拥有大量财富的人——将主导政治对话。至少该裁决的批评者是这么认为的。 +

现在并不奇怪，自 “联合公民组织案” 的裁决以来，竞选捐款的增加幅度非常大。有很多实体在政治上投入资金，但我只想关注一种被称为 “政治行动委员会”（Political Action Committee，PAC）的组织。这些组织筹集资金，目的是影响民众投票给他们支持的候选人，我想让你了解三种这样的组织。 +

第一种是 “关联政治行动委员会”（connected PACs），它们由企业或其他实体（如工会）组建。这是与这些组织相关联的政治行动委员会。所以 “关联政治行动委员会” 只能从其组织成员那里筹集资金，并且这些资金可以有限额地直接捐给候选人。然而，只要遵守个人捐款限额，它们可以筹集不限量的资金。 +

第二种是 “非关联政治行动委员会”（non-connected PACs），它们独立于某个组织而组建，通常围绕着特定的公共利益，比如持枪权利或女性在政治中的地位。和 “关联政治行动委员会” 一样，对 “非关联政治行动委员会” 的捐款也受到法律限制。它们可以接受来自公众任何人的捐款，并直接捐给候选人。 +

第三种是 “超级政治行动委员会”（super PACs），自 “联合公民组织案” 的裁决以来，它们大量涌现。“超级政治行动委员会” 可以由任何人组建，可以接受不限额的捐款，但不能与候选人直接协调。这些是最具争议的政治行动委员会，因为批评者认为 “超级政治行动委员会” 有可能限制民主，并且只会让富人发声。然后我们又回到了言论自由的问题上。 +

所以总的来说，在过去的50年里，竞选资金一直备受争议，很难说在这段时间里情况是变好了还是变差了。 +
