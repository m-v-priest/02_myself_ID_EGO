Well hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're looking at another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 Marbury v. Madison 马伯里诉麦迪逊案 in 1803, which is arguably 可说是 the most significant 重要的 case in Supreme Court history. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked judicial review 司法审查 style, well then let's get to it. +  

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. Remember that the first two political parties 政党 to emerge 出现 in our fair nation were the Federalists 联邦党人 and the Democratic-Republicans 民主共和党人, and they fought bitterly 激烈地 on just about every issue available to fight about. And as it turned out 结果是, the Federalist president John Adams lost the election of 1800 to Democratic-Republican candidate 候选人 Thomas Jefferson. That was a bitter 痛苦的 loss for the Federalists, but Adams hatched a plan 制定计划 to try to dilute 削弱 the power and influence of the Democratic-Republicans once Jefferson took office 就职. +  

The Federalist-dominated Congress created a slew of 大量的 new courts and judgeships 法官职位, and as you probably remember, it is the president who is constitutionally 宪法上 responsible for appointing 任命 federal judges. So Adams, in his last days as president, packed 塞满 the federal judiciary 司法系统 full of Federalist judges who would likely frustrate 挫败 Jefferson's policy agenda 政策议程 during his presidency. That's why they called him old sneaky Adams -- they didn't, don't don't write that down. Anyway, Adams was signing commissions 委任状 for these judges right up until the moment he left office, and most of them were delivered, but a few of them were not. And when Jefferson took office, he ordered his secretary of state 国务卿 to leave those undelivered commissions undelivered. +  

Well, that really chapped the thighs of 惹恼了 a guy named William Marbury, who was one of those judges who had been appointed but had not yet received his commission. And so he sued 起诉 Madison in the Supreme Court to get his commission by what's known as a writ of mandamus 强制令, which is just a court order 法院命令 for an official to do what they're legally required to do. So Marbury wanted the court to issue 签发 a writ of mandamus in order for Madison to deliver the commission. +  

Okay, now let's talk about the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中 in this case. Now what I'm about to tell you is not going to sound relevant 相关的 to this case, so you're just going to have to stick with me here. The constitutional principle at stake in this case is the jurisdiction clauses 管辖权条款 in Article 3 of the Constitution. Now remember, Article 3 is all about the judicial branch 司法部门 and how it gets its power and what kinds of cases it can hear. Jurisdiction 管辖权 means the scope of power 权力范围 the court exercises over those different kinds of cases. +  

So Article 3 states that the Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction 初审管辖权 and appellate jurisdiction 上诉管辖权. Original jurisdiction means the court has power to hear certain cases for the first time. Appellate jurisdiction means that the court has power to hear appeals 上诉 from lower federal courts in other cases. Now I'm not slinging vocabulary 抛专业术语 around just for funsies -- you really have to understand jurisdiction to understand this case. +  

Now according to Article 3 of the Constitution, there are only a narrow set of circumstances 情形 which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over, and they are as follows: "In all cases affecting ambassadors 大使, other public ministers 公使 and consuls 领事, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction." So the Supreme Court only has original jurisdiction in cases involving states or foreign ambassadors or consuls. Okay, put that in your pocket -- we'll come back to it later. +  

So as the case came before the Supreme Court, Chief Justice 首席大法官 John Marshall distilled the essence of 提炼出…的核心 it into three questions: Number one, does Marbury have the legal right 法律权利 to his commission? Number two, if yes, is the court-ordered writ of mandamus the proper legal means 适当的法律手段 to get the commission? And number three, if yes, does the court have the authority 权力 to grant 批准 the writ of mandamus? +  

Okay, so now let's look at how the court decided the case with respect to 关于 the three questions. The answer to number one -- did Marbury have the legal right to his commission -- the answer was yes. Congress established 设立 the new courts and the judgeships, and the president did his constitutional duty 宪法职责 to appoint judges to them, and the fact that some of them were undelivered was just a technicality 技术性细节. Everything on that count was above board 合法的 and perfectly legal. +  

Okay, so if Marbury was legally entitled to 有权获得 his commission, then the answer to the second question -- is the writ of mandamus the legal means to get it -- yes. And at this point, Marbury is feeling pretty good about himself, like everything is going in his favor 对他有利, and he's about to get the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandamus for his commission. But regarding the third question, Marbury better get on his disappointment pants, because things are about to take a turn 发生转折, and it's the answer to this third question that makes this case the most important Supreme Court case in history. So pay attention and do not miss this. +  

The third question was: does the court have the authority to grant the writ of mandamus? And John Marshall's answer to this question was no. Let me explain. If you were paying attention earlier when we looked at Article 3, you might have noticed that it says precisely 确切地 nothing about the court issuing writs of mandamus. So why did Marbury think the court could do so? Well, he thought so because the Judiciary Act of 1789 《1789年司法法》, which in addition to 除…之外 establishing all the lower federal courts, also said in Article 13 that the Supreme Court has authority to issue writs of mandamus in original jurisdiction cases. That is the law. +  

So Marbury's case is being heard before the Supreme Court for the first time, and that means it's within original jurisdiction, and therefore, according to the Judiciary Act, the court has the authority to issue the writ. But John Marshall saddled his judicial horse of power and did something unbelievable: he said that Article 13 of the Judiciary Act conflicted with 与…冲突 Article 3 of the Constitution. Remember, Article 3 gives the court original jurisdiction over cases involving states and ambassadors, but Marbury and Madison are neither states nor ambassadors -- Marbury is a judge and Madison is a cabinet secretary 内阁部长. So while the writ would be legal under the Judiciary Act because it in essence 本质上 expanded the scope of the court's original jurisdiction, John Marshall said that's not what the Constitution says about the court's authority, and therefore Article 13 of the Judiciary Act is unconstitutional 违宪的 and therefore null and void 无效的. So ultimately 最终, Marbury did not get his commission. +  

So that brings us to why this case matters. When John Marshall declared 宣布 that law unconstitutional, he essentially 实质上 invested 赋予 the Supreme Court with the power of judicial review 司法审查权. Now Hamilton had written about this in Federalist 78 《联邦党人文集》第78篇, but it wasn't explicitly 明确地 mentioned in the Constitution. However, with this case, the judicial branch became the final interpreter 解释者 of the Constitution and took up the mantle of 承担起…的职责 striking down 废除 or upholding 支持 laws passed by Congress based on their constitutionality 合宪性. Massive 重大的 case -- watch this video again if you didn't get it all. +

== 中文释义


嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即1803年的“马伯里诉麦迪逊案（Marbury v. Madison）”，这可以说是最高法院历史上最重要的案件。所以，如果你准备好以“司法审查（judicial review）”的方式激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

一如既往，我们先从案件事实讲起。还记得美国最早出现的两个政党是联邦党（Federalists）和民主共和党（Democratic-Republicans），它们在几乎所有可以争论的问题上都激烈交锋。结果，联邦党总统约翰·亚当斯（John Adams）在1800年大选中输给了民主共和党候选人托马斯·杰斐逊（Thomas Jefferson）。这对联邦党来说是惨痛的失败，但亚当斯策划了一个计划，试图在杰斐逊就职后削弱民主共和党的权力和影响力。 +  

联邦党主导的国会设立了一系列新法院和法官职位，正如你可能记得的，宪法规定总统负责任命联邦法官。因此，亚当斯在卸任前的最后日子里，将联邦司法机构塞满了可能在杰斐逊任期内阻挠其政策议程的联邦党法官。这就是为什么有人称他为“老奸巨猾的亚当斯”——其实并没有人这么叫，别记下来。总之，亚当斯直到离任前都在签署这些法官的委任状，大部分委任状都已送达，但有几份尚未送达。杰斐逊就职后，命令国务卿将那些未送达的委任状扣留不发。 +  

这让一个名叫威廉·马伯里（William Marbury）的人非常不满，他是已被任命但尚未收到委任状的法官之一。于是，他向最高法院起诉麦迪逊（Madison），要求通过所谓的“ mandamus（强制令）”（即法院命令官员履行法定职责的命令）来获得自己的委任状。马伯里希望法院发布强制令，要求麦迪逊送达委任状。 +  

现在我们来谈谈本案涉及的宪法原则。我接下来要说的内容听起来可能与本案无关，但请你耐心听下去。本案涉及的宪法原则是宪法第三条（Article 3）中的管辖权条款。还记得吗，宪法第三条全部关于司法分支，包括其如何获得权力以及可以审理哪些类型的案件。“管辖权（jurisdiction）”指的是法院对不同类型案件行使权力的范围。 +  

宪法第三条规定，最高法院同时拥有“初审管辖权（original jurisdiction）”和“上诉管辖权（appellate jurisdiction）”。初审管辖权意味着法院有权首次审理某些案件。上诉管辖权意味着法院有权审理来自下级联邦法院的上诉案件。我不是为了好玩而堆砌术语——你必须理解管辖权才能理解这个案件。 +  

根据宪法第三条，最高法院仅对以下特定情形拥有初审管辖权：“在所有涉及大使、其他公使和领事的案件，以及州为一方当事人的案件中，最高法院拥有初审管辖权。” 因此，最高法院仅在涉及州或外国大使、领事的案件中拥有初审管辖权。记住这一点——我们稍后会再提到。 +  

当案件提交到最高法院时，首席大法官约翰·马歇尔（John Marshall）将案件的核心提炼为三个问题：第一，马伯里是否有法律权利获得他的委任状？第二，如果有，法院下令的强制令是否是获得委任状的适当法律手段？第三，如果是，法院是否有权签发强制令？ +  

现在我们来看看法院如何就这三个问题作出裁决。第一个问题的答案——马伯里是否有法律权利获得委任状——是肯定的。国会设立了新法院和法官职位，总统履行了宪法规定的任命法官的职责，部分委任状未送达只是技术性问题。从这一点来看，一切都是合法合规的。 +  

既然马伯里在法律上有权获得委任状，那么第二个问题的答案——强制令是否是获得委任状的法律手段——也是肯定的。此时，马伯里感觉良好，认为一切都对他有利，最高法院即将为他的委任状签发强制令。但关于第三个问题，马伯里最好做好失望的准备，因为事情即将转折，而正是第三个问题的答案使本案成为最高法院历史上最重要的案件。请注意，不要错过这一点。 +  

第三个问题是：法院是否有权签发强制令？约翰·马歇尔的回答是否定的。让我解释一下。如果你之前留意到宪法第三条的内容，可能会注意到其中完全没有提到法院可以签发强制令。那么马伯里为什么认为法院可以这样做呢？因为1789年《司法法》（Judiciary Act of 1789）除了设立所有下级联邦法院外，还在第13条规定最高法院有权在初审管辖案件中签发强制令。这是法律规定的。 +  

马伯里的案件是首次提交给最高法院审理，这意味着属于初审管辖范围，因此根据《司法法》，法院有权签发强制令。但约翰·马歇尔祭出了他的司法权力之剑，做出了令人难以置信的举动：他宣布《司法法》第13条与宪法第三条冲突。还记得吗，宪法第三条规定法院对涉及州和大使的案件拥有初审管辖权，但马伯里和麦迪逊既不是州也不是大使——马伯里是法官，麦迪逊是内阁部长。因此，尽管根据《司法法》，强制令在本质上扩大了法院初审管辖权的范围，看似合法，但约翰·马歇尔认为这不符合宪法对法院权力的规定，因此《司法法》第13条违宪，无效。最终，马伯里没有获得他的委任状。 +  

这就引出了本案的重要性。当约翰·马歇尔宣布该法律违宪时，他实质上赋予了最高法院“司法审查（judicial review）”的权力。汉密尔顿（Hamilton）曾在《联邦党人文集》第78篇（Federalist 78）中谈到过这一点，但宪法中并未明确提及。然而，通过本案，司法分支成为宪法的最终解释者，并承担起根据合宪性废除或支持国会通过的法律的职责。这是一个具有里程碑意义的案件——如果没完全理解，建议再看一遍这个视频。 +
