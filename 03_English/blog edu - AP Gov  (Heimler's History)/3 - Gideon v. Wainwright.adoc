Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to look at yet another one of your required 必修的 Supreme Court 最高法院 cases for the AP Government curriculum 课程大纲, namely Gideon versus Wainwright in 1963. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked 挤脑汁（幽默说法）with a court-appointed 法院指定的 lawyer 律师, then let's get to it. +

So as always, let's begin with the facts 事实 of the case. In 1961, Clarence Earl Gideon broke into 闯入 a pool hall 台球厅 in Florida, smashed up 捣毁 a cigarette machine 香烟贩卖机 to remove coins 硬币 from it, and stole some cash 现金 from the register 收银机. He was summarily 立即地；草率地 arrested 逮捕 and sent to trial 审判. Now our boy Gideon was no stranger to standing trial for crimes in other states — he had done so on several occasions 多次 — and because he was poor, the courts appointed 指定 a lawyer to represent 代表 him at no charge 免费. However, in Florida, the law said that the state will only appoint a lawyer to a defendant 被告 in capital cases 死刑案件, and thus Gideon was not entitled to 有权获得 representation 辩护；代表 appointed by the state. So Gideon acted as 担任；充当 his own lawyer, and wouldn't you know it, he was convicted 定罪. He appealed 上诉, and eventually 最终 his case was brought before the Supreme Court. +

So once it arrived at 被提交至 the court, what was the constitutional 宪法的 principle 原则 at stake 涉及的核心问题? Well, this was a case based on the Sixth Amendment 第六修正案, which says, "In all criminal prosecutions 刑事起诉, the accused 被告 shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel 法律顾问；律师 for his defense 辩护." Now remember, the Sixth Amendment as written only applies to the federal government 联邦政府. So in this case, a state government was denying Gideon a lawyer to represent him, and therefore technically speaking 严格来说, the Sixth Amendment was not being violated because he was not standing trial in a federal court 联邦法院. However, the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause 平等保护条款 applies the liberties 自由权 contained in the Bill of Rights 权利法案 to the states, and so that's what this case is about: does the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment require states to appoint 指派；指定 a lawyer to someone who cannot afford it 无力承担的? +

But don't get confused here. If you see a question about this case and it asks you about the constitutional principle at stake, it's the Sixth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment part is just asking you whether the Sixth Amendment can be applied to 应用于 the state. So let's see if it does by looking at the decision 判决 handed down 作出（正式决定）by the court. +

Well, the court ruled 判决 unanimously 一致地 in Gideon's favor, arguing that yes, the Sixth Amendment's provision 规定 for a lawyer does apply to the states via 通过 the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. And in the unanimous 一致通过的 opinion written by Justice Hugo Black, the argument went like this: "The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed 被认为 fundamental 基本的；根本的 and essential 必不可少的 to fair 公正的 trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions 宪法 and laws have laid great emphasis 强调 on procedural 程序性的 and substantive 实质性的 safeguards 保障措施 designed to assure 确保 fair trials before impartial 公正的 tribunals 法庭 in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble 高尚的 ideal 理想 cannot be realized 实现 if the poor man charged with a crime has to face his accusers 控告者 without a lawyer to assist 协助；帮助 him." +

Okay, so let's finish by talking about why this case matters 重要；意义重大. This case matters first of all because through it, the Sixth Amendment was incorporated 纳入；适用于 to the states. Remember, the process of selective incorporation 选择性适用 is how the court systematically 系统地 applies the liberties and protections 自由与保障 of the Bill of Rights to state governments. Second, in the wake of 随着；在……之后 this decision, states were required to fund 提供资金 and train 培训 thousands of public defense lawyers 公设辩护律师 who could be called upon 被要求 to defend clients who are not able to afford their lawyers. And that public defense system has continued to grow until today, which means that if you break into a pool hall and smash up a cigarette machine, you will certainly 有把握地 have someone to defend you. But you know, even better than that would be just don't do it. You know, stay in school. You know, that's it. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个最高法院的必学案例，也就是1963年的 “吉迪恩诉温赖特案”（Gideon versus Wainwright）。所以，如果你准备好以有法庭指定律师的方式汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

和往常一样，我们先来看这个案件的事实。1961年，克拉伦斯·厄尔·吉迪恩（Clarence Earl Gideon）闯入佛罗里达州（Florida）的一家台球厅，砸开一台香烟售卖机取走里面的硬币，并从收银机里偷了一些现金。他随即被捕并被送上法庭受审。我们这位吉迪恩先生可不是第一次在其他州因犯罪接受审判——他已经有过好几次这样的经历了——而且因为他很穷，法庭免费为他指定了一名律师。然而，佛罗里达州的法律规定，该州只在死刑案件中为被告指定律师，因此吉迪恩无权获得州政府指定的律师。所以吉迪恩只能自己为自己辩护，你肯定能想到，他被判有罪。他提出上诉，最终他的案件被提交到最高法院。 +

所以当这个案件提交到法院后，所涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？嗯，这个案件基于第六修正案（Sixth Amendment），该修正案规定：“在所有刑事诉讼中，被告有权获得辩护律师的帮助。” 要记住，从字面上看，第六修正案只适用于联邦政府。所以在这个案件中，州政府拒绝为吉迪恩指定律师，从技术层面讲，第六修正案并没有被违反，因为他不是在联邦法院受审。然而，第十四修正案（14th Amendment）的平等保护条款（Equal Protection Clause）将《权利法案》（Bill of Rights）所包含的自由权利应用到各州，所以这个案件的关键在于：第十四修正案的平等保护条款是否要求各州为那些请不起律师的人指定律师呢？ +

但在这里不要混淆。如果你看到关于这个案件的问题，问你所涉及的宪法原则，那就是第六修正案。第十四修正案部分只是在问你第六修正案能否应用到各州。所以让我们看看法院的裁决是怎样的。 +

嗯，法院一致做出了有利于吉迪恩的裁决，认为是的，第六修正案中关于律师的规定通过第十四修正案的平等保护条款适用于各州。在雨果·布莱克（Hugo Black）大法官撰写的一致意见中，其论点如下：“被指控犯罪的人获得律师帮助的权利，在某些国家可能不被认为是公正审判的基本和必要条件，但在美国是。从一开始，我们的州宪法和国家宪法及法律就非常重视程序和实体保障措施，以确保在公正的法庭上进行公正的审判，在这样的审判中，每个被告在法律面前都是平等的。如果被指控犯罪的穷人不得不独自面对原告而没有律师的帮助，这个崇高的理想就无法实现。” +

好的，所以最后让我们谈谈这个案件为什么重要。这个案件很重要，首先是因为通过这个案件，第六修正案被应用到各州。记住，选择性合并的过程就是法院系统地将《权利法案》的自由和保护应用到州政府的过程。其次，在这个裁决之后，各州被要求为数千名公设辩护律师提供资金并对他们进行培训，这些律师可以为那些请不起律师的当事人进行辩护。而且公设辩护系统持续发展至今，这意味着如果你闯入台球厅并砸开香烟售卖机，肯定会有人为你辩护。但你知道，比这更好的做法是根本不要这么做。你懂的，好好待在学校里。就是这样。 +

好的，我希望这对你有帮助。如果你想要更多帮助，那么点击这里获取复习资料包，这将帮助你在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分。我这里还有关于所有其他最高法院必学案例的视频，所以如果你对此感兴趣，就点击观看吧。如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，你了解我的，我会照做的。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +
