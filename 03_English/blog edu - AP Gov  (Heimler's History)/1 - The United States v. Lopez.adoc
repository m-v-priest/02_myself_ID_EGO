hey there and welcome back to heimler's history. in this video we're going to look at a supreme court case 最高法院案例 required for the ap government curriculum 课程, namely 即；也就是 united states versus lopez 美国诉洛佩兹案 in 1995. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milked interstate commerce style （以州际贸易的方式获取知识）, well then let's get to it. +

so as with every required supreme court case for this curriculum, you need to know five things about this case. first up, the facts of the case. so in united states versus lopez, here is what happens: in san antonio texas, a high school senior named alfonso lopez decided to carry a 38 caliber pistol 38口径手枪 along with some bullets 子弹 to school. the administration 学校管理部门 received an anonymous tip 匿名举报 that he had done so, found the gun, and then lopez was arrested and sent to jail 入狱 because under texas law it was forbidden 禁止 to carry a gun onto school property 校园. the next day, all the charges were dropped against lopez 对洛佩兹的指控被撤销. wait why? just hold on, i'ma tell you. as it turned out 结果是, in addition to 除……之外 the state laws in texas prohibiting guns on school property, there was also a federal law called the gun free school zones act of 1990 1990年无枪校园区法案 which also prohibited guns on school property. so the state charges were dropped because federal charges were brought against lopez 对洛佩兹提出联邦指控, and as it turned out, lopez was found guilty of 被判有罪 breaking this federal law and sentenced to six months in prison 被判入狱六个月. +

okay, that seems very clean, but here's where it gets a little messy 复杂. let's look at the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中；攸关, and here's where i have to clear up 澄清 a potential misconception 潜在误解. because the facts of this case have everything to do with guns, you're naturally going to think this is a second amendment 第二修正案 case, but it is not. let me say it plainly 坦率地说: u.s versus lopez is not a case about the bang bang in the pew pew （形象化表述枪支问题）. think back to the enumerated powers of congress 国会的列举权力 in the reserved powers of the states 各州的保留权力. where in the constitution does it say that the federal congress has any authority 权力 to pass legislation 立法 about guns? that is right, it does not. gun legislation is a state issue 州事务. so how in the world did congress pass a federal law prohibiting guns on school property? well, they did it based on the authority granted to congress in the commerce clause 商业条款 of article 1 section 8 of the constitution. there it says that congress has the authority to regulate commerce 监管贸易 with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the indian tribes 印第安部落. now for our purposes, we just need to focus on congress's authority to regulate commerce among the several states 州际贸易. and look, scholars have been arguing for a long time over exactly what this clause means, but basically it just means that congress has the authority to establish a free trade zone 自由贸易区 among the states. +

so congress passed the gun-free school zones act based on its authority in the commerce clause. now that sounds confusing -- like what in the world does regulating interstate commerce 州际贸易 have to do with bringing guns to school? well, let me just show you how each side argued its case. the lawyers for the united states argued that guns in school are related to interstate commerce because guns lead to gun violence 枪支暴力, and if there is gun violence in schools, then people from other states might be less likely to travel through those towns, which would negatively affect commerce in those places. additionally 此外, if gun violence is rampant 猖獗的 on school property, the learning environment deteriorates 恶化, which leads to a less educated citizenry 公民群体, which then leads to those citizens not buying as much stuff. if that sauce tastes a little weak to you （比喻说法，意为如果觉得这个理由不充分）, well i'm not going to argue. lopez's lawyers on the other hand argued that gun regulation on school property is a power specifically reserved for the states 各州专门保留的权力, and that the connection between the commerce clause and gun violence is weak at best 充其量很微弱 and tyrannical federal overreach 联邦政府的专横越权 at worst 最坏的情况. in other words, congress had no business 无权 passing this law in the first place. +

so those were the arguments. let's see how it was decided. as it turned out, the supreme court sided with 支持 lopez in a 5-4 decision, and here's the reasoning from the majority opinion 多数意见: "under the theories that the government presents in support of this case, it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power 联邦权力的限制, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement 刑事执法 or education where states historically have been sovereign 主权的. thus, if we were to accept the government's arguments, we are hard-pressed to posit 设想 any activity by an individual that congress is without power to regulate." in other words, if congress can use the commerce clause to regulate guns on school property, what can't congress regulate with the commerce clause? +

so at the end of the day 归根结底, here's why this case matters. ultimately this is a case about federalism 联邦制 and the balance of power 权力平衡 between the federal and state governments. there have been cases in the past like mcculloch versus maryland 麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案 that have tipped this balance of power toward the federal government 使权力天平向联邦政府倾斜, but in the united states versus lopez, the decision is a clear example of the court ruling in favor of state power over federal power 法院裁决支持州权力高于联邦权力. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。在这个视频中，我们将研究美国大学预修课程政府学中一门必修的最高法院案例，即1995年的“美国诉洛佩兹案”（united states versus lopez）。所以，如果你准备好以州际商业的方式汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

就像这门课程中每一个必修的最高法院案例一样，关于这个案例你需要了解五件事。首先是这个案例的事实。在“美国诉洛佩兹案”中，事情是这样的：在得克萨斯州圣安东尼奥（san antonio, texas），一名叫阿方索·洛佩兹（Alfonso Lopez）的高中高年级学生决定携带一把点38口径的手枪和一些子弹去学校。学校管理层收到匿名举报说他这么做了，找到了那把枪，然后洛佩兹被捕并被送进了监狱，因为根据得克萨斯州的法律，携带枪支进入学校财产范围内是被禁止的。第二天，对洛佩兹的所有指控都被撤销了。等等，为什么呢？别急，我会告诉你的。事实证明，除了得克萨斯州禁止在学校财产范围内携带枪支的州法律之外，还有一项联邦法律，即1990年的《无枪校区法案》（gun free school zones act of 1990），该法案也禁止在学校财产范围内携带枪支。所以州里的指控被撤销了，因为联邦对洛佩兹提出了指控，结果是，洛佩兹被判违反这项联邦法律，并被判处六个月监禁。 +

好的，看起来很清楚了，但这里有个小复杂之处。让我们看看这个案例所涉及的宪法原则，在这里我得澄清一个潜在的误解。因为这个案例的事实都与枪支有关，你自然会认为这是一个与第二修正案相关的案例，但其实不是。我直白地说：“美国诉洛佩兹案”不是一个关于“砰砰”（枪支）的案例。回想一下国会的列举权力以及各州的保留权力。在宪法中哪里说联邦国会有权通过关于枪支的立法呢？没错，宪法里没这么说。枪支立法是一个州的事务。那么国会究竟是如何通过一项禁止在学校财产范围内携带枪支的联邦法律呢？嗯，他们这么做是基于宪法第一条第八款中赋予国会的权力。该条款规定国会有权管理与外国的商业往来，以及各州之间和与印第安部落的商业往来。就我们的目的而言，我们只需要关注国会管理各州之间商业往来的权力。而且，学者们长期以来一直在争论这个条款的确切含义，但基本上它意味着国会有权在各州之间建立一个自由贸易区。 +

所以国会基于其在商业条款下的权力通过了《无枪校区法案》。这听起来很令人困惑——到底管理州际商业往来与携带枪支去学校有什么关系呢？嗯，让我给你展示双方是如何辩论的。美国方面的律师认为，学校里的枪支与州际商业有关，因为枪支会导致枪支暴力，如果学校里存在枪支暴力，那么其他州的人可能不太愿意经过那些城镇，这会对那些地方的商业产生负面影响。此外，如果学校财产范围内枪支暴力猖獗，学习环境就会恶化，这会导致公民受教育程度降低，进而导致这些公民购买的东西减少。如果你觉得这个理由有点站不住脚，嗯，我也不反驳。另一方面，洛佩兹的律师认为，对学校财产范围内的枪支进行监管是各州专门保留的权力，而且商业条款与枪支暴力之间的联系往好了说是很弱的，往坏了说是联邦权力的过度扩张。换句话说，国会一开始就无权通过这项法律。 +

这些就是双方的论点。让我们看看判决结果。结果是，最高法院以5比4的判决支持了洛佩兹，这是多数意见的理由：“根据政府在这个案件中提出的理论，很难察觉到对联邦权力的任何限制，即使是在刑法执行或教育等州在历史上拥有主权的领域。因此，如果我们接受政府的论点，我们很难假定个人的任何活动是国会无权监管的。” 换句话说，如果国会可以利用商业条款来监管学校财产范围内的枪支，那么有什么是国会不能用商业条款来监管的呢？ +

所以归根结底，这个案例重要的原因是这样的。从根本上说，这是一个关于联邦制以及联邦政府和州政府之间权力平衡的案例。过去有像“麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案”（mcculloch versus maryland）这样的案例，这些案例使权力平衡倾向于联邦政府，但在“美国诉洛佩兹案”中，判决是法院做出有利于州权力而非联邦权力的裁决的一个明显例子。 +
