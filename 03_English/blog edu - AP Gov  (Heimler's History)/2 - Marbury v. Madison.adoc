Well, hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're looking at another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely Marbury versus Madison in 1803, which is arguably 可以说 the most significant 重要的；有意义的 case in Supreme Court history. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked judicial review 司法审查 style, then let's get to it. +

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. Remember that the first two political parties 政党 to emerge 出现 in our fair nation were the Federalists 联邦党人 and the Democratic Republicans 民主共和党人, and they fought bitterly 激烈地 on just about every issue available to fight about. And as it turned out 结果是, the Federalist president, President John Adams, lost the election of 1800 to Democratic Republican candidate 候选人 Thomas Jefferson. That was a bitter loss 惨痛的失败 for the Federalists, but Adams hatched a plan 制定计划 to try to dilute 削弱 the power and influence of the Democratic Republicans once Jefferson took office 就职. +

The Federalist-dominated 联邦党人主导的 Congress created a slew of 大量的 new courts and judgeships 法官职位, and as you probably remember, it is the president who is constitutionally 依据宪法地 responsible for appointing federal judges 任命联邦法官. So Adams, in his last days as president, packed the federal judiciary 联邦司法部门 full of Federalist judges who would likely frustrate 挫败 Jefferson's policy agenda 政策议程 during his presidency. That's why they called him old sneaky 鬼鬼祟祟的 Adams -- they didn't, don't don't write that down. +

Anyway, Adams was signing commissions 委任状 for these judges right up until the moment he left office, and most of them were delivered, but a few of them were not. And when Jefferson took office, he ordered his secretary of state 国务卿 to leave those undelivered commissions undelivered. Well, that really chapped the thighs 惹恼了某人 of a guy named William Marbury, who was one of those judges who had been appointed but had not yet received his commission. And so he sued 起诉 Madison in the Supreme Court to get his commission by what's known as a writ of mandamus 训令状, which is just a court order 法院命令 for an official to do what they're legally required to do. So Marbury wanted the court to issue 签发 a writ of mandamus in order for Madison to deliver the commission. +

Okay, now let's talk about the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中的 in this case. Now what I'm about to tell you is not going to sound relevant 相关的 to this case, so you're just going to have to stick with me here. The constitutional principle at stake in this case is the jurisdiction clauses 管辖权条款 in Article 3 of the Constitution. Now remember, Article 3 is all about the judicial branch 司法部门 and how it gets its power and what kinds of cases it can hear. Jurisdiction 管辖权 means the scope of power 权力范围 the court exercises over those different kinds of cases. +

So Article 3 states that the Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction 初审管辖权 and appellate jurisdiction 上诉管辖权. Original jurisdiction means the court has power to hear certain cases for the first time. Appellate jurisdiction means that the court has power to hear appeals 上诉 from lower federal courts 下级联邦法院 in other cases. Now I'm not slinging vocabulary 抛词汇 around just for funsies -- you really have to understand jurisdiction to understand this case. +

Now according to Article 3 of the Constitution, there are only a narrow set of circumstances 情况 which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over, and they are as follows: "All cases affecting ambassadors 大使, other public ministers 公使 and consuls 领事, and those in which a state shall be party 当事人, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction." So the Supreme Court only has original jurisdiction in cases involving states or foreign ambassadors or consuls. Okay, put that in your pocket -- we'll come back to it later. +

So as the case came before the Supreme Court, Chief Justice 首席大法官 John Marshall distilled the essence of 提炼…的精髓 it into three questions: Number one, does Marbury have the legal right 合法权利 to his commission? Number two, if yes, is the court-ordered writ of mandamus the proper legal means 合适的法律手段 to get the commission? And number three, if yes, does the court have the authority 权力 to grant 授予 the writ of mandamus? +

Okay, so now let's look at how the court decided the case with respect to 关于 the three questions. With respect to number one -- did Marbury have the legal right to his commission -- the answer was yes. Congress established the new courts and the judgeships, and the president did his constitutional duty 宪法职责 to appoint judges to them, and the fact that some of them were undelivered was just a technicality 技术性问题. Everything on that count was above board 光明正大的 and perfectly legal. +

Okay, so if Marbury was legally entitled to 有权获得 his commission, then the answer to the second question -- is the writ of mandamus the legal means to get it -- yes. And at this point, Marbury is feeling pretty good about himself, like everything is going in his favor 对他有利 and he's about to get the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandamus for his commission. But regarding the third question, Marbury better get on his disappointment pants, because things are about to take a turn 发生转变, and it's the answer to this third question that makes this case the most important Supreme Court case in history. So pay attention and do not miss this. +

The third question was: does the court have the authority to grant the writ of mandamus? And John Marshall's answer to this question was no. Let me explain. If you were paying attention earlier when we looked at Article 3, you might have noticed that it says precisely 确切地 nothing about the court issuing writs of mandamus. So why did Marbury think the court could do so? Well, he thought so because the Judiciary Act of 1789 1789年司法条例, which in addition to 除…之外 establishing all the lower federal courts, also said in Article 13 that the Supreme Court has authority to issue writs of mandamus in original jurisdiction cases. That is the law. +

So Marbury's case is being heard before the Supreme Court for the first time, and that means it's within original jurisdiction, and therefore, according to the Judiciary Act, the court has the authority to issue the writ. But John Marshall saddled his judicial horse of power 运用他的司法权力 and did something unbelievable. He said that Article 13 of the Judiciary Act conflicted with 与…冲突 Article 3 of the Constitution. Remember, Article 3 gives the court original jurisdiction over cases involving states and ambassadors, but Marbury and Madison are neither states nor ambassadors -- Marbury is a judge and Madison is a cabinet secretary 内阁部长. So while the writ would be legal under the Judiciary Act because it in essence 本质上 expanded the scope of the court's original jurisdiction, John Marshall said that's not what the Constitution says about the court's authority, and therefore Article 13 of the Judiciary Act is unconstitutional 违宪的 and therefore null and void 无效的. So ultimately, Marbury did not get his commission. +

So that brings us to why this case matters. When John Marshall declared that law unconstitutional, he essentially invested 赋予 the Supreme Court with the power of judicial review 司法审查权. Now Hamilton had written about this in Federalist 78, but it wasn't explicitly 明确地 mentioned in the Constitution. However, with this case, the judicial branch became the final interpreter 最终解释者 of the Constitution and took up the mantle of 承担起…的职责 striking down 废除 or upholding 支持 laws passed by Congress based on their constitutionality 合宪性. Massive case -- watch this video again if you didn't get it all right. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。在这个视频中，我们要研究美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个最高法院的必学案例，也就是1803年的 “马伯里诉麦迪逊案”（Marbury versus Madison），可以说这是最高法院历史上最重要的案例。所以，如果你准备好以司法审查的方式汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

和往常一样，我们先来看这个案件的事实。要记得，在我们这个美好的国家出现的最早的两个政党是联邦党（Federalists）和民主共和党（Democratic Republicans），他们在几乎所有能争论的问题上都激烈交锋。结果是，联邦党总统约翰·亚当斯（John Adams）在1800年的选举中输给了民主共和党候选人托马斯·杰斐逊（Thomas Jefferson）。对联邦党人来说，这是个惨痛的失败，但亚当斯想出了一个计划，试图在杰斐逊上任后削弱民主共和党人的权力和影响力。 +

由联邦党人主导的国会设立了一系列新的法院和法官职位，而且你可能还记得，根据宪法，总统负责任命联邦法官。所以亚当斯在他作为总统的最后日子里，让联邦司法部门充斥着联邦党法官，这些法官很可能会在杰斐逊担任总统期间阻碍他的政策议程。这就是为什么他们称他为 “老奸巨猾的亚当斯”——不过，别把这个写下来。 +

总之，亚当斯在离任前一直在签署这些法官的委任状，大部分委任状都送达了，但有几份没有送达。杰斐逊上任后，他命令他的国务卿不要送达那些未送达的委任状。这可惹恼了一个叫威廉·马伯里（William Marbury）的人，他是那些被任命但还没有收到委任状的法官之一。于是他向最高法院起诉麦迪逊（Madison），要求通过一种被称为 “ mandamus”（强制令）的方式获得他的委任状，强制令就是法院命令一名官员做他们在法律上被要求做的事情。所以马伯里希望法院发布强制令，让麦迪逊送达他的委任状。 +

好的，现在我们来谈谈这个案件所涉及的宪法原则。我接下来要告诉你的内容听起来可能与这个案件不相关，但你得跟着我理解。这个案件所涉及的宪法原则是宪法第三条中的管辖权条款。要记得，宪法第三条全是关于司法分支的，包括它如何获得权力以及它可以审理哪些类型的案件。管辖权意味着法院对不同类型案件行使权力的范围。 +

所以宪法第三条规定，最高法院同时拥有初审管辖权和上诉管辖权。初审管辖权意味着法院有权首次审理某些案件。上诉管辖权意味着法院有权审理来自下级联邦法院的上诉案件。我可不是随便说说这些词汇——你真的必须理解管辖权才能理解这个案件。 +

根据宪法第三条，最高法院仅在狭窄的一系列情况下拥有初审管辖权，具体如下：“所有涉及大使、其他公使和领事的案件，以及一州为一方当事人的案件，最高法院拥有初审管辖权。” 所以最高法院仅在涉及州、外国大使或领事的案件中拥有初审管辖权。好的，记住这一点——我们稍后还会回到这个问题上。 +

当这个案件提交到最高法院时，首席大法官约翰·马歇尔（John Marshall）将其本质归纳为三个问题：第一，马伯里是否在法律上有权获得他的委任状？第二，如果是，法院命令的强制令是否是获得委任状的适当法律手段？第三，如果是，法院是否有权签发强制令？ +

好的，现在我们来看看法院是如何就这三个问题对案件做出裁决的。关于第一个问题——马伯里是否在法律上有权获得他的委任状——答案是肯定的。国会设立了新的法院和法官职位，总统履行了他在宪法上任命法官的职责，而一些委任状未送达只是一个技术问题。在这一点上，一切都是合法合规的。 +

好的，所以如果马伯里在法律上有权获得他的委任状，那么对于第二个问题——强制令是否是获得委任状的法律手段——答案是肯定的。在这一点上，马伯里自我感觉良好，觉得一切都对他有利，他认为最高法院会发布强制令来让他获得委任状。但关于第三个问题，马伯里最好做好失望的准备，因为事情即将发生转折，而对这个第三个问题的答案使这个案件成为最高法院历史上最重要的案件。所以注意听，不要错过这一点。 +

第三个问题是：法院是否有权签发强制令？约翰·马歇尔对这个问题的答案是否定的。让我来解释一下。如果你之前在我们看宪法第三条时认真听了，你可能已经注意到，宪法中根本没有提到法院签发强制令的事情。那么为什么马伯里认为法院可以这么做呢？嗯，他这么认为是因为1789年的《司法法》（Judiciary Act of 1789），该法案除了设立所有下级联邦法院之外，还在第13条中规定最高法院有权在初审管辖权案件中签发强制令。这是法律规定的。 +

所以马伯里的案件是首次在最高法院被审理，这意味着它属于初审管辖权范围，因此，根据《司法法》，法院有权签发强制令。但约翰·马歇尔运用他的司法权力，做了一件令人难以置信的事情。他说《司法法》第13条与宪法第三条相冲突。记住，宪法第三条赋予法院对涉及州和大使的案件的初审管辖权，但马伯里和麦迪逊既不是州也不是大使——马伯里是一名法官，麦迪逊是一名内阁部长。所以虽然根据《司法法》，强制令是合法的，因为它本质上扩大了法院初审管辖权的范围，但约翰·马歇尔说这不符合宪法对法院权力的规定，因此《司法法》第13条是违宪的，所以无效。所以最终，马伯里没有得到他的委任状。 +

所以这就引出了这个案件为什么重要。当约翰·马歇尔宣布这项法律违宪时，他实际上赋予了最高法院司法审查的权力。汉密尔顿（Hamilton）在《联邦党人文集》第78篇（Federalist 78）中曾提到过这一点，但宪法中并没有明确提及。然而，通过这个案件，司法分支成为了宪法的最终解释者，并承担起根据合宪性来废除或维持国会通过的法律的职责。这是一个重大的案件——如果你没有完全理解，再看一遍这个视频。 +
