well hey there and welcome back to H history. in the last video I began talking about unit 2 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 即；也就是 the structures, powers and functions 功能 of Congress 国会, and in this video we're going to do it again but we're going deeper. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

so in this video, here's what we're trying to accomplish 完成；实现: explain how the structure, powers and functions of both houses of Congress affect the policymaking process 政策制定过程. and look, just to warn you up front 预先；提前, this is a big one, so G thyself （疑似表述有误，推测为“gear up yourself”，意为做好准备） and let's jump in. so the emphasis 重点 in this video is policymaking 政策制定 and how the structures of Congress affect it, and because the Senate 参议院 and the house 众议院 both have different structures and Powers, policymaking is accomplished in different ways depending on which house you're in. +

so first let's talk about the leadership structure 领导架构 in each house, and just for poops and Giggles （俚语，意为只是为了好玩） let's begin with the House of Representatives 众议院. the Constitution 宪法 only mentions one specific leadership position in the house, and that's the speaker of the house 众议院议长, and other than saying that the house member shall choose this leader, doesn't say anything about what the speaker does. however, since this position is by the choice of the house, which is to say the house members vote on this person, that means the speaker of the house will always be a member of the majority party 多数党. why? well because if a party holds the majority in the house, ain't no way （俚语，意为不可能） they're going to vote for a leader in the other party. now over time, the house has made its own rules for itself and how the speaker will function, and this has become a very powerful position in the house because the house follows parliamentary procedure 议会程序 to structure its work, which is an elaborate 复杂精细的 system of rules for who can speak when and how. the speaker has the power to recognize who can speak and who cannot. additionally 此外, the speaker is the one who makes committee assignments 委员会任命, and we're going to talk more about committees later, but for now just understand that since everyone in the house is going to be in some committee, and some are more desirable 理想的；值得拥有的 than others, you want to be on the speaker's good side 与……保持良好关系 so you can get the better committee assignments. +

okay, now one rung below 下一等级 the speaker are the majority and minority leaders 多数党领袖和少数党领袖. again, these are not positions given to the house by the Constitution, but they're important nonetheless 尽管如此. these are the folks that guide their own party members and how to vote and other policymaking issues. additionally, the majority and minority leaders help direct debate, and basically you just need to understand that party leaders want to make sure that their members are working together to achieve policy outcomes favorable to their party 有利于他们政党的政策结果, and leaders make sure that that's happening. then below them you have the majority and minority whips 多数党党鞭和少数党党鞭, and they're responsible for party discipline 党纪 -- like if ralat Tren （疑似有误） party members are acting like turds （俚语，意为表现糟糕） and not Towing the party line （应为“toeing the party line”，意为遵循党的路线）, or if representatives are not showing up for votes, then the whip steps in and gets them back in line 使他们回到正轨. +

okay, that's the basic leadership structure of the house. so now let's consider the leadership of the Senate. the Constitution actually mentions two leadership positions in the Senate, and the first is the president of the Senate 参议院议长, which is also the vice president of the United States 美国副总统. now that sounds like a very lofty 崇高的；高级的 position, you know, like the president of the Senate, you the more sure house in Congress, but in reality the vice president has a lot of other stuff going on, especially in Modern Times 现代, and so they're rarely present at the Senate. so that brings us to the next Senate leadership position mentioned in the Constitution: the president pro tempore 临时议长, although you most often hear this called the president pro tem. the Constitution says that the senate members will choose the president pro tem, and that means again that this will be a member of the majority party, and this person leads the Senate when the vice president is away. +

the next Senate leadership position you should know is the majority and minority leaders. the majority leader has a great deal of power because he or she sets the legislative agenda 立法议程 by determining which bills reach the floor for debate 进入议会辩论环节 and which do not, and the main way the majority leader does this is by controlling the calendar assignments of bills 法案的日程安排. the Senate calendar 参议院日程表 is what determines what bills and resolutions 决议 are awaiting debate and voting. +

okay, so now that we have the basic leadership structure for both houses of Congress down, let's look at how each house actually gets its legislative work 立法工作 done, and for that I need to tell you about committees 委员会. both the Senate and the house use committees to get their work done, and that's not because it's mandated 强制规定 in the Constitution, but because it's more like a practical necessity 实际需要. committees are smaller groups of legislators 立法者 who debate and draft precise legislation 起草精确的立法 that would otherwise be impossible in the large group setting of either the house or the Senate. +

now there are four species of committees 委员会种类 that you need to know. and first is the standing committee 常设委员会, and you know as much as I'd like to tell you that they're called that because their members do all their work without sitting down, that's not really what it is. a standing committee is one which remains from congressional session 国会会议 to Congressional session -- like it's always there because those committees are dealing with issues that are always present. an example of a standing committee in the Senate is the Appropriations Committee 拨款委员会, which is the largest and arguably 可以说 the most powerful Committee in the Senate. this group debates and makes decisions on where Federal money is going to be spent, and since that's an issue that always exists, this is a good example of a standing committee. a good example of a standing committee in the house is the Ways and Means Committee 筹款委员会, which is among the most powerful and prestigious 有声望的 committees there, and this is the group that's responsible for taxation bills of various kinds. +

the next kind of committee you need to know is the joint committee 联合委员会, and these are groups that involve members from both the house and the Senate -- like they are together jointly 共同地. we have the joint committee on the library 图书馆联合委员会, which deals with issues relating to the Library of Congress 美国国会图书馆. you also have the joint committee on printing 印刷联合委员会, which deals with the publishing arm 出版部门 of the federal government. both of these committees are examples of joint committees that persist over time 长期存在, but sometimes joint committees can be formed in the short term 短期 as well. +

the next kind of committee you need to know is the select committee 特别委员会. this is the opposite of a standing committee, which is to say it's a temporary committee 临时委员会 that is formed for a very specific purpose. if you took AP US History, you may remember the Missouri Compromise 密苏里妥协案, which established where slavery could exist in the United States. well that compromise was hammered out 经过反复讨论制定 by a select committee that only existed for about a week and then was disbanded 解散 after the purpose was accomplished. +

and finally you need to know about conference committees 协商委员会. I already mentioned that in order for a bill 法案 to become a law, identical versions of it must be passed by both houses of Congress, and if both houses can't agree on an identical version, then a conference committee is formed to hammer out the differences 消除分歧. now it'll be important for you to understand that even though both houses use committees to get work done, the different constitutional responsibilities 宪法职责 of the house and the Senate affect the policymaking process, say in committees. +

all right, if you're overwhelmed by all this information, well then go and have yourself a proper cry in the corner and let's keep going. okay, we've talked about leadership structures and committees, and so now let's get down to exactly how Congress gets its work done, and let's consider each house separately. +

first, the house, and as I mentioned the last video, house rules mandate 规定 limited debate among its members because of its sheer size 庞大的规模, and in many cases that limit is an hour. now in terms of which bills make it to the floor for debate 进入辩论环节, we have to talk about the house rules committee 众议院规则委员会, which is a very powerful committee. it's essentially the gatekeeper 守门人 for all legislation 立法, and if the rules committee doesn't let a bill through for debate, it essentially dies. additionally, this committee decides when votes take place and assigns bills to various committees for debate and revision 修订. and the house also makes use of What's called the committee of the whole 全院委员会, which is just a procedural move 程序上的举措 that relaxes some of the rules for debate so that amendments for bills 法案修正案 can be debated quicker. it doesn't require all 435 members to be present, just a minimum Quorum 法定人数 of 100 Representatives. the house also uses what's called a discharge petition 解交请愿书 in order to get their work done. if a Bill gets stuck in committee 卡在委员会, which can happen more often than you think because bills often go to committees to Die, the house can muster 召集 a majority vote which brings that bill out of the committee and to the floor for a vote. +

okay, now let's look at how the Senate gets its work done. because of its smaller size, the rules for debate are a lot more relaxed 宽松的. in fact, Senators 参议员 enjoy the privilege of unlimited debate time 无限辩论时间的特权, and so that presents the occasion for the filibuster 冗长辩论. this is an attempt to stall 拖延 or kill a bill by talking for a very long time, and the award for longest filibuster goes to STM Thurman, who talked for 24 hours in 18 minutes to try to kill a Civil Rights bill 民权法案 in 1957. apparently his AIDS （疑似有误，推测为“aides”，意为助手） set up a bucket in a closet right off the senate floor so that he could you know uh make water （俚语，意为小便） and still keep one foot on the senate floor and thus not be disqualified for filibustering 因冗长辩论被取消资格. so you know, that's fun. anyway, that kind of talkie-talkie filibuster rarely happens anymore. today, all someone has to do is threaten a filibuster, and it basically accomplishes the same thing. now there is something called the clure rule （应为“cloture rule”，意为终止辩论规则） by which the Senate can get a filibustering senator to shut their mouth hole and bring the bill to a vote, but that requires three-fifths of the Senate to agree, and that is not easy to do. so that's why all it takes is the threat of a filibuster to stall a bill. +

the Senate also employs the principle of unanimous consent 一致同意原则 to get their work done. this can be applied to a lot of different situations, but it's basically a call for agreement by all Senators to restrict certain privileges 特权 for the sake of getting work done faster. so if everyone agrees that there will be no filibustering, for example, then the Senate can proceed without fear of getting bogged down 陷入困境. okay, now that's good enough for our purposes. +

now let's talk about the basic process of how a bill becomes a law. a bill can be sponsored by 由……发起 a member from either the house or the Senate, and as that bill is considered and debated, it often changes. sometimes non-gain writers （疑似有误，推测为“non-germane riders”，意为无关修正案） are added, which are Provisions 条款 to the bill that actually have nothing to do with the subject of the bill. usually these writers benefit a certain representative's District 选区 or state. another way a bill can change is by the addition of pork barrel spending 政治分肥支出, which are funds earmarked for 专门拨给 a particular representative's District. either way, the point is bills change as they move through the legislative process 立法过程, and once the bill is assigned to a committee, it can be further debated and changed. but once it comes out, it goes to the floor for a vote, and the voting process can sometimes be affected by log rolling 互投赞成票, which is basically when one representative says to another, "hey I'll vote for your bill if you vote for mine." it's really just an elaborate system of congressional backs scratching 国会内部的利益交换. +

now probably among the most complex legislation the Congress has to consider is the passing of the federal budget 联邦预算, and there are two kinds of spending they have to consider. first is mandatory spending 强制性支出, which is the money that they have to allocate 分配 by law. for example, Medicare 医疗保险 and Medicaid 医疗补助 are Healthcare programs which by law have to be paid for, thus they are examples of mandatory spending. but after all of this is accounted for, everything left over is discretionary spending 可自由支配支出, and as you can probably imagine, committees debate hard over how to allocate These funds 分配这些资金. although the biggest category for discretionary spending is always human resources 人力资源, which is to say paying the federal employees who run the government. wouldn't it be hilarious have Congress only allocated as much discretionary spending as they had money in their vaults 金库? no man, we always spend more than we have, and that is called deficit spending 赤字支出. as mandatory spending increases, it makes sense that discretionary spending should decrease, but that is usually not the case. so where does Congress get all that extra scratch （俚语，意为钱）? well they either borrow it or they raise taxes. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课（H History）。在上一个视频中，我开始讨论美国大学预修课程政府学（AP Government）第二单元的内容，也就是国会的结构、权力和职能。在这个视频中，我们将继续深入探讨。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那么我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要达成的目标是：解释国会两院的结构、权力和职能如何影响政策制定过程。听着，我要提前提醒你，这是一个重要的内容，所以打起精神来，让我们开始吧。这个视频的重点是政策制定以及国会的结构如何影响它。因为参议院（Senate）和众议院（the house）都有不同的结构和权力，政策制定会根据所在的议院以不同的方式完成。 +

所以首先让我们谈谈每个议院的领导结构，为了找点乐子，我们从众议院开始。宪法只提到了众议院中的一个特定领导职位，那就是众议院议长（the speaker of the house），并且除了说众议员将选择这个领导人之外，没有说明议长的职责。然而，因为这个职位是由众议院选择的，也就是说众议员对这个人进行投票，这意味着众议院议长将永远是多数党的成员。为什么呢？因为如果一个政党在众议院中占多数，他们不可能投票给另一个政党的领导人。随着时间的推移，众议院为自身制定了规则以及议长如何履行职责，并且议长在众议院中成为了一个非常有权力的职位，因为众议院遵循议会程序来组织其工作，这是一个关于谁能在何时发言以及如何发言的精细规则体系。议长有权决定谁能发言，谁不能发言。此外，议长负责安排委员会成员，我们稍后会更多地谈论委员会，但现在只要明白，因为众议院中的每个人都要加入某个委员会，并且有些委员会比其他委员会更受欢迎，所以你希望与议长保持良好关系，这样你就能获得更好的委员会任务。 +

好的，现在在议长之下是多数党领袖和少数党领袖。同样，这些职位不是宪法赋予众议院的，但它们仍然很重要。这些人指导他们自己的党派成员如何投票以及处理其他政策制定问题。此外，多数党领袖和少数党领袖帮助引导辩论，基本上你只需要明白，党派领袖希望确保他们的成员共同努力，以实现有利于他们党派的政策结果，并且领袖们要确保这一点得以实现。然后在他们之下是多数党党鞭和少数党党鞭，他们负责党派纪律——比如，如果某个党派成员表现不佳，不遵循党派路线，或者众议员不出席投票，那么党鞭就会介入并让他们回到正轨。 +

好的，这就是众议院的基本领导结构。现在让我们考虑参议院的领导结构。宪法实际上提到了参议院中的两个领导职位，第一个是参议院议长（the president of the Senate），也就是美国副总统（the vice president of the United States）。听起来这是一个非常崇高的职位，毕竟是参议院议长，国会中更有地位的议院的议长，但实际上副总统有很多其他事务要处理，尤其是在现代，所以他们很少出席参议院会议。所以这就引出了宪法中提到的参议院的下一个领导职位：临时议长（the president pro tempore，通常也被称为the president pro tem）。宪法规定参议院议员将选择临时议长，这意味着这个人也将是多数党的成员，并且当副总统不在时，这个人将领导参议院。 +

你需要知道的参议院的下一个领导职位是多数党领袖和少数党领袖。多数党领袖有很大的权力，因为他或她通过决定哪些法案可以提交到议场进行辩论，哪些不能，来设定立法议程。多数党领袖做到这一点的主要方式是控制法案的日程安排。参议院日程决定了哪些法案和决议有待辩论和投票。 +

好的，现在我们已经了解了国会两院的基本领导结构，让我们看看每个议院实际上是如何完成其立法工作的，为此我需要告诉你关于委员会的情况。参议院和众议院都使用委员会来完成他们的工作，这不是因为宪法要求这样做，而是因为这在实际中是必要的。委员会是由立法者组成的较小团体，他们辩论并起草精确的立法，而在众议院或参议院的大型团体环境中，这些立法工作是不可能完成的。 +

现在有四种你需要知道的委员会。首先是常设委员会（standing committee），你知道我很想告诉你它们被称为常设委员会是因为其成员在不坐下的情况下完成所有工作，但事实并非如此。常设委员会是指在国会会议期间一直存在的委员会——因为这些委员会处理的是一直存在的问题。参议院中的一个常设委员会的例子是拨款委员会（the Appropriations Committee），它是参议院中最大且可以说是最有权力的委员会。这个团体就联邦资金的使用进行辩论并做出决定，由于这是一个一直存在的问题，所以这是常设委员会的一个很好的例子。众议院中的一个常设委员会的例子是筹款委员会（the Ways and Means Committee），它是众议院中最有权力和声望的委员会之一，这个团体负责各类税收法案。 +

你需要知道的下一种委员会是联合委员会（joint committee），这些委员会由来自参议院和众议院的成员组成——也就是说他们共同协作。我们有图书馆联合委员会（the joint committee on the library），它处理与国会图书馆（the Library of Congress）相关的问题。还有印刷联合委员会（the joint committee on printing），它处理联邦政府的出版事务。这两个委员会都是长期存在的联合委员会的例子，但有时联合委员会也可以短期成立。 +

你需要知道的下一种委员会是特别委员会（select committee）。它与常设委员会相反，也就是说它是为了一个非常特定的目的而成立的临时委员会。如果你学过美国大学预修课程美国历史（AP US History），你可能还记得《密苏里妥协案》（the Missouri Compromise），它确定了奴隶制在美国可以存在的地方。嗯，那个妥协案是由一个特别委员会制定的，这个特别委员会只存在了大约一周，在目的达成后就解散了。 +

最后你需要了解协商委员会（conference committee）。我已经提到过，为了使一项法案成为法律，国会两院必须通过内容相同的法案，如果两院不能就相同版本达成一致，那么就会成立一个协商委员会来解决分歧。你需要明白，即使两院都使用委员会来完成工作，众议院和参议院不同的宪法职责会影响政策制定过程，比如在委员会中。 +

好的，如果你被这些信息弄得不知所措，那么去角落里好好哭一场，然后我们继续。好的，我们已经讨论了领导结构和委员会，现在让我们具体看看国会是如何完成其工作的，让我们分别考虑每个议院。 +

首先是众议院，正如我在上一个视频中提到的，由于众议院的规模庞大，众议院的规则规定议员们的辩论时间有限，在很多情况下限制为一个小时。现在就哪些法案可以提交到议场进行辩论而言，我们必须谈谈众议院规则委员会（the house rules committee），这是一个非常有权力的委员会。它基本上是所有立法的把关者，如果规则委员会不让一项法案进行辩论，那么这项法案基本上就夭折了。此外，这个委员会决定何时进行投票，并将法案分配到各个委员会进行辩论和修订。众议院还利用所谓的全院委员会（the committee of the whole），这只是一种程序上的举措，它放宽了一些辩论规则，以便更快地对法案修正案进行辩论。不需要435名议员全部出席，只需100名众议员的最低法定人数即可。众议院还使用所谓的解议请愿书（discharge petition）来完成他们的工作。如果一项法案被困在委员会中——这种情况比你想象的更常见，因为法案常常在委员会中夭折——众议院可以进行多数投票，将该法案从委员会中提出并提交到议场进行投票。 +

好的，现在让我们看看参议院是如何完成其工作的。由于参议院规模较小，辩论规则宽松得多。实际上，参议员享有无限辩论时间的特权，所以这就为冗长辩论（filibuster）提供了机会。冗长辩论是指通过长时间发言来拖延或否决一项法案的尝试，最长的冗长辩论记录由斯特姆·瑟曼（STM Thurman）保持，他在1957年为了否决一项民权法案发言了24小时18分钟。显然，他在参议院议场旁边的壁橱里放了一个桶，这样他就可以在不失去冗长辩论资格的情况下方便（上厕所），因为他的一只脚还在参议院议场。所以，这很有趣。不管怎样，那种长时间的辩论现在很少发生了。如今，只要有人威胁要进行冗长辩论，基本上就能达到同样的效果。现在有一种所谓的“结束辩论规则”（clure rule），根据这个规则，参议院可以让进行冗长辩论的参议员闭嘴，并对法案进行投票，但这需要参议院五分之三的议员同意，这并不容易做到。所以这就是为什么只要有进行冗长辩论的威胁就能拖延一项法案。 +

参议院还采用一致同意的原则来完成他们的工作。这可以应用于很多不同的情况，但基本上这是要求所有参议员达成一致，为了更快地完成工作而限制某些特权。所以例如，如果每个人都同意不进行冗长辩论，那么参议院就可以继续进行，而不用担心陷入僵局。好的，这些内容对我们的目的来说已经足够了。 +

现在让我们谈谈一项法案成为法律的基本过程。一项法案可以由众议院或参议院的一名议员提出，在对该法案进行审议和辩论时，它常常会发生变化。有时会添加无关修正案（non-gain writers），这些是对法案的规定，但实际上与法案的主题无关。通常这些修正案会使某个众议员所在的选区或州受益。法案发生变化的另一种方式是增加“政治分肥”支出（pork barrel spending），这些资金是专门为某个众议员所在的选区预留的。不管怎样，关键是法案在立法过程中会发生变化，一旦法案被分配到一个委员会，它会被进一步辩论和修改。但一旦法案从委员会提出，它就会提交到议场进行投票，并且投票过程有时会受到“互投赞成票”（log rolling）的影响，基本上就是一个众议员对另一个众议员说：“嘿，如果你投票支持我的法案，我就投票支持你的法案。” 这实际上是国会中一种复杂的相互帮忙的体系。 +

现在，国会必须审议的最复杂的立法可能是通过联邦预算，并且他们必须考虑两种支出。首先是强制性支出（mandatory spending），这是他们依法必须分配的资金。例如，医疗保险（Medicare）和医疗补助（Medicaid）是医疗保健项目，依法必须支付费用，因此它们是强制性支出的例子。但在考虑完这些之后，剩下的所有支出都是可自由支配支出（discretionary spending），你可以想象，委员会会就如何分配这些资金进行激烈辩论。虽然可自由支配支出最大的类别总是人力资源，也就是说支付管理政府的联邦雇员的工资。如果国会只分配他们金库中有的可自由支配支出，那不是很有趣吗？不，实际上我们的支出总是超过我们所拥有的资金，这被称为赤字支出（deficit spending）。随着强制性支出的增加，可自由支配支出应该减少，这是合理的，但实际情况通常并非如此。那么国会从哪里获得所有这些额外的资金呢？嗯，他们要么借款，要么增税。 +

well hey there and welcome back to H history. in the last video I began talking about unit 2 of the AP Government curriculum, namely the structures, powers and functions of Congress, and in this video we're going to do it again but we're going deeper. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it.

so in this video, here's what we're trying to accomplish: explain how the structure, powers and functions of both houses of Congress affect the policymaking process. and look, just to warn you up front, this is a big one, so G thyself and let's jump in. so the emphasis in this video is policymaking and how the structures of Congress affect it, and because the Senate and the house both have different structures and Powers, policymaking is accomplished in different ways depending on which house you're in.

so first let's talk about the leadership structure in each house, and just for poops and Giggles let's begin with the House of Representatives. the Constitution only mentions one specific leadership position in the house, and that's the speaker of the house, and other than saying that the house member shall choose this leader, doesn't say anything about what the speaker does. however, since this position is by the choice of the house, which is to say the house members vote on this person, that means the speaker of the house will always be a member of the majority party. why? well because if a party holds the majority in the house, ain't no way they're going to vote for a leader in the other party. now over time, the house has made its own rules for itself and how the speaker will function, and this has become a very powerful position in the house because the house follows parliamentary procedure to structure its work, which is an elaborate system of rules for who can speak when and how. the speaker has the power to recognize who can speak and who cannot. additionally, the speaker is the one who makes committee assignments, and we're going to talk more about committees later, but for now just understand that since everyone in the house is going to be in some committee, and some are more desirable than others, you want to be on the speaker's good side so you can get the better committee assignments.

okay, that's the basic leadership structure of the house. so now let's consider the leadership of the Senate. the Constitution actually mentions two leadership positions in the Senate, and the first is the president of the Senate, which is also the vice president of the United States. now that sounds like a very lofty position, you know, like the president of the Senate, you the more sure house in Congress, but in reality the vice president has a lot of other stuff going on, especially in Modern Times, and so they're rarely present at the Senate. so that brings us to the next Senate leadership position mentioned in the Constitution: the president pro tempore, although you most often hear this called the president pro tem. the Constitution says that the senate members will choose the president pro tem, and that means again that this will be a member of the majority party, and this person leads the Senate when the vice president is away.

okay, now let's look at how the Senate gets its work done. because of its smaller size, the rules for debate are a lot more relaxed. in fact, Senators enjoy the privilege of unlimited debate time, and so that presents the occasion for the filibuster. this is an attempt to stall or kill a bill by talking for a very long time, and the award for longest filibuster goes to STM Thurman, who talked for 24 hours in 18 minutes to try to kill a Civil Rights bill in 1957. apparently his AIDS set up a bucket in a closet right off the senate floor so that he could you know uh make water and still keep one foot on the senate floor and thus not be disqualified for filibustering. so you know, that's fun. anyway, that kind of talkie-talkie filibuster rarely happens anymore. today, all someone has to do is threaten a filibuster, and it basically accomplishes the same thing. now there is something called the clure rule by which the Senate can get a filibustering senator to shut their mouth hole and bring the bill to a vote, but that requires three-fifths of the Senate to agree, and that is not easy to do. so that's why all it takes is the threat of a filibuster to stall a bill.

the Senate also employs the principle of unanimous consent to get their work done. this can be applied to a lot of different situations, but it's basically a call for agreement by all Senators to restrict certain privileges for the sake of getting work done faster. so if everyone agrees that there will be no filibustering, for example, then the Senate can proceed without fear of getting bogged down. okay, now that's good enough for our purposes.

now let's talk about the basic process of how a bill becomes a law. a bill can be sponsored by a member from either the house or the Senate, and as that bill is considered and debated, it often changes. sometimes non-gain writers are added, which are Provisions to the bill that actually have nothing to do with the subject of the bill. usually these writers benefit a certain representative's District or state. another way a bill can change is by the addition of pork barrel spending, which are funds earmarked for a particular representative's District. either way, the point is bills change as they move through the legislative process, and once the bill is assigned to a committee, it can be further debated and changed. but once it comes out, it goes to the floor for a vote, and the voting process can sometimes be affected by log rolling, which is basically when one representative says to another, "hey I'll vote for your bill if you vote for mine." it's really just an elaborate system of congressional backs scratching.

now probably among the most complex legislation the Congress has to consider is the passing of the federal budget, and there are two kinds of spending they have to consider. first is mandatory spending, which is the money that they have to allocate by law. for example, Medicare and Medicaid are Healthcare programs which by law have to be paid for, thus they are examples of mandatory spending. but after all of this is accounted for, everything left over is discretionary spending, and as you can probably imagine, committees debate hard over how to allocate These funds. although the biggest category for discretionary spending is always human resources, which is to say paying the federal employees who run the government. it wouldn't it be hilarious have Congress only allocated as much discretionary spending as they had money in their vaults? no man, we always spend more than we have, and that is called deficit spending. as mandatory spending increases, it makes sense that discretionary spending should decrease, but that is usually not the case. so where does Congress get all that extra scratch? well they either borrow it or they raise taxes.
