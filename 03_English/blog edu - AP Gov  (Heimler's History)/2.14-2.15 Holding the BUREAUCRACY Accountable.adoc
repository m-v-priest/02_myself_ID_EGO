Hey there and welcome back to Heimlich's History. We've been going through unit two of the AP government curriculum, and that means in this video it's time to talk about how the federal bureaucracy 联邦官僚机构 is held accountable 负有责任的 by the other three branches of the federal government. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with congressional oversight 国会监督, let's get to it. +

So in this video here's what we're trying to do: explain how congress uses its oversight power 监督权力 and its relationship with the executive branch 行政部门, and explain how the president ensures 确保 that the executive branch agencies and departments carry out 执行 their responsibilities in concert with 与…一致 the goals of the administration 政府. So if you've been watching the previous videos on the power and responsibilities of the federal bureaucracy, you will no doubt 无疑地 know that the bureaucracy has a great deal of power over how laws are implemented 实施 and how they are executed 执行. They do this through their delegated discretionary authority 委托自由裁量权 and their rule making procedures 制定规则程序. And if you want to know more about that, then see the previous video on unit 2 topic 13. +

So with all this authority 权力 to make rules that have the force of law 法律效力, how do the other branches keep this unwieldy 难驾驭的 bureaucratic beast 官僚机构 in check 控制? Well, the vast majority of the checking comes from congress and the president, although the supreme court joins the fun now and then 时不时地 too, and I reckon 认为 we ought to look at each of them in turn 依次. +

So congress is concerned that the bureaucratic agencies actually implement the laws as congress intended 按照国会的意图 when they passed the law. And so in order to exercise this oversight, there are two ways for congress to check the bureaucracy. First is by the use of committee hearings 委员会听证会. Congress has many committees that correspond to 与…对应 different government agencies and will call directors of those agencies to testify 作证 and give reports on their progress in carrying out the law. Sometimes these are just friendly check-ins 友好的检查, and other times it gets a little crazy. For example, as I record this video, there's a judiciary committee 司法委员会 hearing involving the FBI with reference to 关于 an abuse scandal 滥用职权丑闻 among Olympic gymnasts 奥林匹克体操运动员. Several gymnasts reported their abuse to FBI agents, and the FBI waited for over a year to do anything about it, and in the period of their inaction 不作为 many dozens more gymnasts were being abused. And so the judiciary committee is hearing testimony from the gymnasts and is going to take the FBI to task 责备 because they so horribly bungled 搞砸了 the implementation of the law. +

But congress can also check the bureaucracy by the power of the purse 财政权. Recall 回想 from earlier in this unit that the power of the purse means that congress is responsible for funding these bureaucratic agencies, and an agency cannot spend any taxpayer money until they receive authorization of spending measures 支出措施的授权 from congress. Remember, congress is the entity 实体 responsible for the federal budget 联邦预算, and so when the time comes around to fund certain agencies, if those agencies aren't executing the law the way congress thinks is appropriate, they can decrease the funding available to those agencies. This is especially true after the passage of the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 1974年预算和扣押控制法案, which gave congress a lot more power over budgetary decisions 预算决策 at the expense of 以…为代价 the president's power. +

Okay, that's how congress can check the bureaucracy, and now let's have a look at how the president can do it. Now remember that the bureaucracy officially falls under the authority of 受…管辖 the president, and so there are many different means by which the president can make sure the bureaucracy is functioning well. The president of course has a policy agenda 政策议程 to implement, and if the bureaucracy isn't cooperating with that agenda, the president can use both formal 正式的 and informal powers 非正式权力 to shake things up 进行调整. +

Among the president's formal powers is appointment 任命. If the bureaucracy isn't behaving like the president would like, then the president can appoint new heads of agencies, and usually those are going to be folks sympathetic to 支持 the president's policy agenda. Now there are some limits to this -- the president can't fire regulatory commission heads without reason 无缘无故 -- but the president can fire and hire other bureaucratic positions at will 随意. For example, in 2017 Donald Trump abruptly 突然地 fired James Comey who was the director of the FBI, because Trump believed Comey was not handling the investigation into Russia's interference with the 2016 election in a manner that aligned with 与…一致 Trump's agenda. Now that was a highly contentious 有争议的 firing, I admit that, and I'm not commenting on it here -- I'm just using it as an example of a way the president can use his formal powers to reorganize the bureaucracy. +

The president can also make use of informal powers like the executive order 行政命令 to bring the bureaucracy into line with 使…符合 the presidential policy agenda. For example, civil rights 公民权利 were a huge agenda item for President Lyndon B. Johnson, and in 1964 he signed the Civil Rights Act 民权法案 into law, which prohibited employment discrimination 就业歧视 based on race, gender or religion. And you know hey, that was a good thing. But the implementation of this law meant that if discrimination did occur, the agencies responsible for enforcing it would only know about it after the fact 事后. But Johnson decided to sign Executive Order 11246, which took civil rights and employment one step further. This executive order mandated 要求 that any contractors hired by the federal government had to take affirmative action 采取积极行动 -- not only to avoid discrimination, but also to populate their organizations with women and minorities and other discriminated groups. +

Now the president of course would love it if the bureaucracy would operate entirely within the presidential will, but since the bureaucracy is also responsible to congress, that doesn't happen, and sometimes that can cause inefficiencies 效率低下 in the execution of the law. However, the biggest culprit 罪魁祸首 for bureaucratic slowdown 官僚机构的迟缓 is compliance monitoring 合规监测. When a regulatory agency 监管机构 imposes rules on an industry, they must go through the laborious process of following up with 跟进 the players in those industries and make sure that they are complying 遵守, and that takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of work, and thus can slow down the implementation of policies. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing, since the alternative would be for bureaucratic agencies to create rules and then never follow up to see if those under the rules are following them. If that's the case, there's really no point to the rules. +

Okay, now briefly let's talk about how the judicial branch 司法部门 can check the power of the bureaucracy as well. Since the rules and regulations being implemented by the bureaucracy directly affect the lives of Americans with the force of law, that means that people can appeal to the courts 向法院上诉 when one of those rules or regulations is deemed unconstitutional 被认为违宪的. And this of course would be the court exercising judicial review 行使司法审查 over the bureaucracy. Now most of these cases the court rules in favor of 支持 the agency unless there's a blatant violation of the constitution 公然违反宪法, but it is possible. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第二单元，这意味着在这个视频中，我们要谈谈联邦官僚机构是如何受到联邦政府其他三个部门的问责的。所以，如果你准备好了解国会监督下的知识，那我们就开始吧。 +

在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释国会如何运用其监督权力以及它与行政部门的关系，并且解释总统如何确保行政部门的机构和部门按照政府的目标履行职责。所以，如果你看过之前关于联邦官僚机构的权力和职责的视频，你无疑会知道，官僚机构在法律的实施和执行方面拥有很大的权力。它们通过被授予的自由裁量权和制定规则的程序来做到这一点。如果你想了解更多相关内容，可以查看关于第二单元第13个主题的前一个视频。 +

既然官僚机构拥有制定具有法律效力的规则的权力，那么其他部门是如何制衡这个庞大的官僚机构的呢？嗯，绝大多数的制衡来自国会和总统，尽管最高法院偶尔也会参与其中，我认为我们应该依次审视它们。 +

国会关心的是，官僚机构要按照国会通过法律时的意图来实施法律。为了行使这种监督权，国会有两种方式来制衡官僚机构。第一种方式是利用委员会听证会。国会有许多与不同政府机构相对应的委员会，这些委员会会传唤那些机构的负责人来作证，并就他们在执行法律方面的进展情况提交报告。有时候这些听证会只是友好的检查，而其他时候则会变得有点激烈。例如，在我录制这个视频时，有一个司法委员会听证会，涉及联邦调查局（FBI）在奥运会体操运动员中发生的虐待丑闻。几名体操运动员向联邦调查局特工报告了他们所遭受的虐待，但联邦调查局等了一年多都没有采取任何行动，在他们不作为的这段时间里，又有几十名体操运动员受到了虐待。所以司法委员会正在听取体操运动员的证词，并将追究联邦调查局的责任，因为他们在执行法律方面严重失误。 +

但国会也可以通过财政权力来制衡官僚机构。回想一下本单元前面的内容，财政权力意味着国会负责为这些官僚机构提供资金，并且一个机构在未得到国会的支出措施授权之前，不能花费任何纳税人的钱。记住，国会是负责联邦预算的实体，所以当到了为某些机构提供资金的时候，如果那些机构没有按照国会认为合适的方式执行法律，国会可以减少对这些机构的资金支持。在1974年《预算扣押控制法》通过之后，情况尤其如此，该法案以牺牲总统的权力为代价，赋予了国会在预算决策方面更多的权力。 +

好的，这就是国会制衡官僚机构的方式，现在让我们看看总统是如何制衡的。要记住，官僚机构在官方层面隶属于总统，所以总统有很多不同的方式来确保官僚机构正常运转。总统当然有一个要实施的政策议程，如果官僚机构不配合这个议程，总统可以使用正式和非正式的权力来改变局面。 +

总统的正式权力之一是任命权。如果官僚机构的表现不符合总统的期望，总统可以任命新的机构负责人，而且通常会任命那些支持总统政策议程的人。不过这也有一些限制——总统不能无缘无故地解雇监管委员会的负责人——但总统可以随意解雇和雇用其他官僚职位的人员。例如，2017年唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）突然解雇了联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey），因为特朗普认为科米在处理俄罗斯干涉2016年大选的调查时，其方式与特朗普的议程不一致。我承认，那次解雇引起了很大的争议，我在这里不对此进行评论——我只是用它作为总统利用其正式权力重组官僚机构的一个例子。 +

总统也可以利用非正式权力，比如行政命令，使官僚机构与总统的政策议程保持一致。例如，民权是林登·B·约翰逊（Lyndon B. Johnson）总统的一个重要议程项目，1964年他签署了《民权法案》使其成为法律，该法案禁止基于种族、性别或宗教的就业歧视。你知道，这是一件好事。但这项法律的实施意味着，如果发生歧视行为，负责执行该法律的机构只有在事后才会知晓。但是约翰逊决定签署第11246号行政命令，将民权和就业方面的措施又推进了一步。这项行政命令规定，任何被联邦政府雇用的承包商都必须采取积极行动——不仅要避免歧视，还要让女性、少数族裔和其他受歧视群体进入他们的组织。 +

总统当然希望官僚机构完全按照总统的意愿运作，但由于官僚机构也对国会负责，这种情况并不总是能实现，而且有时这会导致法律执行效率低下。然而，导致官僚机构行动迟缓的最大原因是合规监测。当一个监管机构对某个行业实施规则时，它们必须经历一个繁琐的过程，对该行业的参与者进行跟进，以确保他们遵守规定，而这需要大量时间。这需要大量工作，因此会减缓政策的实施速度。不过，这并不一定是件坏事，因为如果不这样做，官僚机构制定规则后就不会跟进，看看被监管对象是否遵守规则。如果是那样的话，制定规则就真的没有意义了。 +

好的，现在简单谈谈司法部门是如何制衡官僚机构的权力的。由于官僚机构实施的规则和条例直接影响美国人的生活，并且具有法律效力，这意味着当其中某一规则或条例被认为违宪时，人们可以向法院上诉。当然，这就是法院对官僚机构行使司法审查权。现在，在大多数这类案件中，法院会支持相关机构，除非存在明显的违宪行为，但这种情况是有可能发生的。 +
