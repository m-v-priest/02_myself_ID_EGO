Hey there, and welcome back to Heimlich's History. Now I've been going through Unit 5 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and this, my friends, is the last video of the curriculum. But go wipe that single tear away from your cheek because we got work to do in order to understand how the form of media 媒体形式 is affecting the way in which we participate in the political process 参与政治进程. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked for the last time, let's get to it. +

So in this video, our learning objective 学习目标 is as follows: explain how increasingly diverse choices of media and communication outlets 媒体和传播渠道 influence political institutions 政治机构 and behavior 行为. Now in the last video, we talked about how the delivery of news 新闻传播 has changed over time. Today we're in the social media age 社交媒体时代, which means that our news increasingly fits what Pew Research 皮尤研究中心 calls the daily me. Which is to say, our news is hyper-filtered 过度过滤 to give us what we want to hear and never what we do not want to hear. +

In an age where attention 注意力 is the most valuable commodity 商品 and demand for constant reporting 持续报道的需求 is ubiquitous 无处不在的, media outlets 媒体机构 have shifted the way that they deliver their content 传播内容. It has become increasingly narrow 狭隘的 and increasingly partisan 党派性的. Like, so much of what you hear today -- whether it's through Twitter or television or a website -- is championing 支持 a particular point of view, which is to say it is biased 有偏见的. +

Now media bias 媒体偏见 has always been around. It's not new nor is it avoidable 可避免的. But with machine learning 机器学习 and delicately crafted algorithms 精心设计的算法, bias is becoming much harder to detect 察觉. Once the algorithms determine what it is we like to read about, then they will keep serving us those kinds of stories. And if those stories are the only ones you read, you are likely to start believing that this perspective 观点 is the only truth that exists, which is to say you are in an echo chamber 回音室 of your own beliefs. +

Now it wasn't always like this. In fact, throughout the middle part of the 20th century, something called the fairness doctrine 公平原则 existed, which meant that news outlets were required by law to devote time to competing perspectives 对立观点 on important issues. You know, that sounds like a good thing, but it could also backfire 产生反效果 too. For example, when cigarette smoking was coming under fire 受到抨击 as a public health crisis 公共卫生危机, tobacco manufacturers 烟草制造商 jumped on the fairness doctrine like a starving man on a Christmas ham. When reports were set to air about the profound health risks of cigarettes, big tobacco was like, "Yeah, but let's be balanced here and talk about the upside of cigarettes." And they were able to do that because of the fairness doctrine. +

Anyway, because of problems like this and many others, the fairness doctrine was booted 废除 in the 80s, and thus without any restrictions on hyper-partisan speech 极端党派言论, we saw the rise of the golden age of conservative and liberal talk radio 保守派和自由派脱口秀广播的黄金时代, which then gave birth to 催生 later partisan cable news pundits 党派性有线电视新闻评论员. +

Now given this reality, how do we detect media bias? Well, there are essentially 本质上 two ways. One way is to determine the ideological preference 意识形态偏好 of the reporters themselves, and for the last 50 years, many studies have shown that they have leaned Democratic 倾向民主党. The second way is to examine the character of the reporting itself. For example, studies have found that liberal reporters 自由派记者 tend to portray 描绘 Democratic politicians 民主党政治家 as bipartisan representatives 两党代表 who are always working at compromise 致力于妥协 while Republicans 共和党人 are portrayed as stubborn and unbending 固执和顽固不化. On the other hand, conservative reporters 保守派记者 tend to portray Republicans as the defenders of American values 美国价值观的捍卫者 while Democrats are portrayed as those who are unraveling 破坏 and trampling American values under foot 践踏美国价值观. +

Now it's going to be very important for you to understand that these media companies -- almost all of them -- are for-profit companies 营利性公司. Their main goal is not to leave a well-informed and critically thinking populace 消息灵通且具批判性思维的民众 in their wakes. No, their main goal is to keep you watching and raking the boom boom （俚语，赚钱）. So to that end, it's important to understand that who owns these companies affects how the news is reported 影响新闻报道方式. +

As partisanship 党派性 in news media has increased, cable news networks 有线电视新闻网 have altered their programming 调整节目 to fit with their audience 迎合观众. CNN typically appeals to 吸引 liberals and Fox News appeals to conservatives. Both claim that they are presenting their facts in a fair and balanced way 以公平和平衡的方式呈现事实, and it can be confusing to citizens who can't discern the partisan ideological slant 辨别党派意识形态倾向. +

Okay, let's talk about news and social media, and the one thing that a lot of people think the social media revolution 社交媒体革命 has going for it is the way in which it increases participation in activist causes 参与激进主义事业. Remember, we talked about media as a linkage institution 连接机构 which gives people an outlet 途径 to participate in their government. You've probably seen hundreds of causes cross your various feeds 信息流, and maybe you clicked on that like button or maybe you even donated. And look at that -- political participation 政治参与 increased. Social media is the best. How do we ever get anything done before it? +

However, in an article written by Malcolm Gladwell called "Small Change: Why the Revolution Will Not Be Tweeted," published in 2010 and which has only gotten more present with age, he argues otherwise 提出相反观点. Gladwell distinguishes between 区分 strong ties 强关系 and loose ties 弱关系 when it comes to social activism 社会激进主义. Strong ties are those that bind a person to a cause 通过紧密关系将人与事业联系起来 through close relationships. Like, why did so many black college students pull up chairs at counters in whites-only restaurants when they were in danger of going to jail or getting brutalized? Well, because they were connected to the other people personally. "My friend is going to sit at the counter, so I'm going to." But Gladwell argues that social media activism 社交媒体激进主义 is a weak tie phenomenon 弱关系现象. Our networks are vast and shallow over social media 社交媒体上的社交网络广泛而浅薄, and the only activism such weak ties can inspire are those causes that don't really require too much of us 不需要我们付出太多的事业. +

So all that to say, there is still an ongoing debate 持续的争论 about the role of social media in creating positive change for society 社交媒体在为社会带来积极变革中的作用. And that, my friends, is the end of the curriculum. Well done getting through it all. +

Now if you're watching this in fall semester 秋季学期, make sure you come back before the exam in May so that I can remind you of everything you've forgotten. I'll be hosting live reviews 举办直播复习 here on the channel to get you everything you need in order to score well. And you might want to subscribe 订阅 if you're going to take APUSH 美国历史 Advanced Placement United States History 或 AP World 世界历史 or AP Euro 欧洲历史 because I've got content for all of these. Anyway, thank you so much for allowing me the privilege of studying with you, and I'll catch you on the flip-flop. Heimler out. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimlich 应为 Heimler）的历史频道。目前我一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第五单元，朋友们，这是本课程的最后一个视频。但先擦掉脸颊上的那一滴眼泪吧，因为为了理解媒体形式如何影响我们参与政治进程的方式，我们还有任务要做。所以，如果你准备好最后一次激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们的学习目标如下：解释日益多样化的媒体和传播渠道的选择如何影响政治机构和政治行为。在上一个视频中，我们谈到新闻的传播方式随着时间发生了怎样的变化。如今我们处于社交媒体时代，这意味着我们的新闻越来越符合皮尤研究中心（Pew Research）所说的 “每日自我”。也就是说，我们的新闻经过高度筛选，只给我们提供我们想听的内容，而绝不会提供我们不想听的内容。 +

在一个注意力是最宝贵资源、对持续报道的需求无处不在的时代，媒体机构已经改变了它们传播内容的方式。这种方式变得越来越狭隘，也越来越带有党派性。比如，如今你听到的很多内容——无论是通过推特（Twitter）、电视还是网站——都在宣扬某种特定观点，也就是说，这些内容是有偏见的。 +

媒体偏见一直都存在。这既不是什么新鲜事，也无法避免。但随着机器学习和精心设计的算法的出现，偏见变得更难察觉。一旦算法确定了我们喜欢阅读的内容，它们就会不断为我们推送这类报道。而如果你只读这些报道，你很可能会开始相信这种观点就是唯一存在的真相，也就是说，你处于一个只听得到自己信念回音的环境中。 +

事情并非一直如此。事实上，在20世纪中期，存在一种被称为 “公平原则” 的东西，这意味着新闻机构在法律上被要求花时间呈现关于重要问题的不同观点。你知道，这听起来是件好事，但它也可能产生反效果。例如，当吸烟被视为公共健康危机而受到抨击时，烟草制造商就像饿汉扑向圣诞火腿一样利用公平原则。当有关香烟对健康造成严重危害的报道准备播出时，大型烟草公司会说：“没错，但我们在这里要保持平衡，也谈谈香烟的好处。” 而他们能够这样做就是因为公平原则。 +

不管怎样，由于诸如此类的问题，公平原则在20世纪80年代被废除了。因此，在对极端党派言论没有任何限制的情况下，我们见证了保守派和自由派谈话类广播的黄金时代的兴起，这随后又催生了后来的党派性有线电视新闻评论员。 +

鉴于这种现实，我们如何察觉媒体偏见呢？嗯，本质上有两种方法。一种方法是确定记者自身的意识形态偏好，在过去的50年里，许多研究表明记者倾向于民主党。第二种方法是审视报道本身的特点。例如，研究发现自由派记者倾向于把民主党政治家描绘成致力于妥协的两党代表，而把共和党人描绘成固执己见的人。另一方面，保守派记者倾向于把共和党人描绘成美国价值观的捍卫者，而把民主党人描绘成正在瓦解和践踏美国价值观的人。 +

重要的是要明白，几乎所有这些媒体公司都是以营利为目的的公司。它们的主要目标不是留下一群消息灵通、有批判性思维的民众。不，它们的主要目标是让你一直观看并获取收益。所以，明白这些公司的所有者会影响新闻的报道方式是很重要的。 +

随着新闻媒体的党派性增强，有线电视新闻网已经调整了它们的节目以迎合观众。美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）通常吸引自由派人士，而福克斯新闻（Fox News）吸引保守派人士。双方都声称他们以公平和平衡的方式呈现事实，而对于那些无法辨别党派意识形态倾向的公民来说，这可能会让他们感到困惑。 +

好的，我们来谈谈新闻和社交媒体。很多人认为社交媒体革命的一个好处是它增加了人们对激进主义事业的参与度。记住，我们曾谈到媒体作为一种联动机构，为人们提供了参与政府事务的途径。你可能在各种推送中看到过成百上千个事业，也许你点过赞，或者甚至进行了捐赠。看看吧——政治参与度提高了。社交媒体太棒了。在社交媒体出现之前，我们到底是怎么做事的呢？ +

然而，马尔科姆·格拉德威尔（Malcolm Gladwell）在2010年发表了一篇名为《小改变：为什么革命不会在推特上发生》的文章，随着时间的推移，这篇文章的观点变得愈发重要。他提出了不同的观点。格拉德威尔在谈到社会激进主义时，区分了强联系和弱联系。强联系是指通过亲密关系将一个人与一项事业联系起来。比如，为什么很多黑人大学生会冒着入狱或遭受暴力的风险，在白人专用餐厅的柜台就座呢？嗯，因为他们与其他人有个人联系。“我的朋友要在柜台就座，所以我也要。” 但格拉德威尔认为社交媒体上的激进主义是一种弱联系现象。我们在社交媒体上的社交网络广泛但肤浅，而这种弱联系所能激发的唯一激进主义是那些对我们要求不高的事业。 +

所以总而言之，关于社交媒体在为社会带来积极改变方面所起的作用，仍然存在争议。朋友们，这就是本课程的结尾了。完成这一切，做得好。 +

如果你在秋季学期观看这个视频，一定要在五月份的考试前回来，这样我可以提醒你那些你已经忘记的内容。我会在这个频道上举办现场复习活动，为你提供取得好成绩所需的一切。如果你要学习美国历史预修课程（APUSH）、世界历史预修课程（AP World）或欧洲历史预修课程（AP Euro），你可能想要订阅，因为我有这些课程的相关内容。不管怎样，非常感谢你让我有幸和你一起学习，我们下次再见。海姆勒，退出。 +
