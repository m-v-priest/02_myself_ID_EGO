Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now we've been going through Unit 3 of the AP Government curriculum 课程, and in this video it's time to talk about the First Amendment 第一修正案's protection of the freedom of the press 新闻自由. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a high bar for prior restraint 预先限制, let's get to it. +

So in this video, here's what we're trying to do: explain the extent 程度 to which the Supreme Court's interpretation 解释 of the First Amendment reflects a commitment 承诺 to individual liberty 个人自由. So along with the other protections of the First Amendment, the freedom of the press is one of the keystones 基石 to a free society. In fact, it was our old friend Anti-Federalist George Mason who said, "The freedom of the press is one of the greatest bulwarks 堡垒 of liberty, and can never be restrained 限制 but by despotic government 专制政府." +

Mr. Mason was absolutely correct on this count. In a society in which the power to govern is in the hands of "We the People," we must have a free press in order to report to us what our elected government officials 民选政府官员 are doing, so that we can keep them accountable 问责 if they end up making a turd sandwich out of our political will 政治意愿. Even so, just like every other liberty we have considered, the right to a free press is not absolute 绝对的. And this liberty must be balanced with 与…平衡 other liberties. For example, we must balance the right to a free press with the Sixth Amendment 第六修正案 right to a fair trial 公平审判, which may necessitate 使成为必要 keeping certain details out of the press. +

Or more to the point 更切题地 for this video: when does the concern for national security 国家安全 necessitate the silencing of the press? That last concern has a term for it that you should know, and it's called prior restraint. And the definition 定义 is all bound up in 包含于 the term itself. If a government is going to exercise prior restraint over the press, that means it seeks to restrain a story prior to 在…之前 its publication 出版. And when you hear that, it sounds just like what George Mason warned us about. If the government can restrain the press in that way, then the people are left in the dark 蒙在鼓里 as to what their government is up to, which is why the standard 标准 for prior restraint has been set very high by the Supreme Court. +

As an example of that, let's talk about one of your required cases: New York Times v. the United States in 1971. So if you know your dates for U.S. history, you'll know that this is right in the midst of 在…中间 the Vietnam War 越南战争, and this war was -- to put it mildly 委婉地说 -- uh, contentious 有争议的 on the home front 国内. Well as it turned out 结果是, a big stack of 一大堆 classified documents 机密文件 known as the Pentagon Papers 五角大楼文件 were leaked 泄露 to the New York Times and the Washington Post, and those papers demonstrated 表明 pretty clearly that the president had lied both to the people and Congress about the war. +

So President Richard Nixon decided to invoke 援引 prior restraint on the publication of these papers on account of 因为 the protection of our national security. Well, the court ruled that the freedom of the press was more important in this case than Nixon's vague 模糊的 claim about national security. Like, at the end of the day 归根结底, Nixon really wasn't concerned about national security -- he was actually concerned about how the Pentagon Papers would tarnish 玷污 his and Lyndon Johnson's reputation 声誉. So in this case, the court established a heavy presumption 推定 against prior restraint. In other words 换句话说, if the government is going to censor 审查 the press, it has to be incredibly clear that a real and imminent 迫在眉睫的 threat 威胁 is being prevented, and in most free press cases that come before the Supreme Court, that high bar 高标准 is never cleared. +

And I will enact 实施 no prior restraint to clicking that subscribe button if you want to send me the message to keep making these videos. Heimler out. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史课程。我们一直在学习美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的第三单元，在这个视频中，我们要讨论第一修正案对新闻自由的保护。所以，如果你准备好以事先限制的高标准来汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

所以在这个视频中，我们要做的是：解释最高法院对第一修正案的解释在多大程度上反映了对个人自由的承诺。与第一修正案的其他保护一样，新闻自由是自由社会的基石之一。事实上，就像我们的老朋友、反联邦党人乔治·梅森（George Mason）所说：“新闻自由是自由的最大保障之一，只有专制政府才会对其加以限制。” +

梅森先生在这一点上完全正确。在一个“我们人民”掌握统治权力的社会中，我们必须拥有新闻自由，以便让我们了解我们选举出来的政府官员在做什么，这样，如果他们最终违背我们的政治意愿，我们就能让他们承担责任。即便如此，就像我们考虑过的其他自由一样，新闻自由的权利也不是绝对的。这项自由必须与其他自由相平衡。例如，我们必须在新闻自由的权利与第六修正案规定的获得公正审判的权利之间取得平衡，这可能需要对某些细节进行新闻封锁。 +

或者更切题地说，在什么情况下，对国家安全的担忧会要求压制新闻呢？对于最后这个问题有一个术语，你应该知道，它叫做事先限制（prior restraint）。其定义就包含在这个术语本身之中。如果政府要对新闻进行事先限制，那就意味着它试图在新闻发布之前对其进行限制。当你听到这个时，这听起来就像乔治·梅森警告过我们的那样。如果政府能够以这种方式限制新闻，那么人民就会对政府的行为一无所知，这就是为什么最高法院对事先限制设定了很高的标准。 +

作为一个例子，让我们来讨论一个必学案例：1971年的 “《纽约时报》诉美国案”（New York Times v. the United States）。所以，如果你了解美国历史上的时间点，你就会知道这个案件正好发生在越南战争期间，而这场战争 —— 委婉地说 —— 在国内引起了争议。结果是，一堆被称为《五角大楼文件》（Pentagon Papers）的机密文件被泄露给了《纽约时报》（New York Times）和《华盛顿邮报》（Washington Post），这些文件清楚地表明总统在战争问题上对人民和国会都撒了谎。 +

所以理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）总统决定以保护国家安全为由，对这些文件的发布进行事先限制。然而，法院裁定，在这个案件中，新闻自由比尼克松关于国家安全的模糊主张更为重要。实际上，归根结底，尼克松真正担心的不是国家安全 —— 他担心的是《五角大楼文件》会损害他和林登·约翰逊（Lyndon Johnson）的声誉。所以在这个案件中，法院确立了强烈反对事先限制的推定。换句话说，如果政府要审查新闻，必须极其明确地表明是为了防止真正迫在眉睫的威胁，而在大多数提交到最高法院的新闻自由案件中，这个高标准是无法达到的。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的第三单元第四主题的内容。如果你想在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分，你可以点击这里获取复习资料包。如果你希望我继续制作这些视频，点击订阅按钮，我不会对此进行事先限制的。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +
