Well hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now in this video, I'm going to teach you how to get a perfect score in one of your AP Government free response questions 自由回答问题, namely 也就是 the concept application question 概念应用问题. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

Okay, when you finish your multiple choice section 多项选择题部分, you're going to turn the page, and the first question staring back at you 映入眼帘的第一个问题 is going to be the concept application question. If you've taken an AP History course, the format 形式；格式 is going to look pretty familiar to you -- which is to say it's going to look just like the SAQs (Short - Answer Questions 简答题) that you did in those courses. So in the concept application question, they are basically trying to get you to apply the concepts 概念 that you've learned in the course to a scenario 情景 that you do not know. And let me repeat that so you don't freak out 惊慌失措 when you see it: when you start reading the stimulus 材料, which always describes a real event that actually occurred, you should not come to the exam knowing that scenario. So if you start reading it and your guts pucker up tighter than a snare drum （比喻，非常紧张）because here's something that you missed in your studies, just tell yourself, "No you didn't. You're not supposed to know this scenario, so calm down." What they want you to do is to apply what you do know to a scenario you don't know. That's it. It's not as hard as it sounds, but you do need some practice with it. And by the way, if you need some more practice on these, you can grab my Ultimate Review Packet, and there are a bunch of these in there with scoring guidelines 评分指南 to help you. +

Anyway, after the stimulus, you'll see three parts to the question labeled A, B, and C. For each of those prompts 题目, you need to write your answers in complete sentences 完整句子. Don't just throw a single word in there, write in bullet points 以要点形式书写 -- subject 主语, verb 动词, object 宾语, sentence 句子. Now if the prompt begins with the word "identify 识别；指出", then you really only need to write one sentence naming the thing that they're asking for. However, if you see a prompt beginning with any other word like "explain 解释" or "describe 描述" or "draw a conclusion 得出结论", then you're going to need to write a little bit more, and the general rule of thumb 经验法则 is two to three content-rich sentences 内容丰富的句子. And remember two things: number one, be specific with your evidence 证据具体, and then number two, relate it back to your prompts 紧扣题目. So many students lose points on these because they are either too vague 模糊的 or they don't relate their answer back to the prompt. So be specific and relate the answer back to your prompt, and I'll show you what I mean when we look at an example. +

So let's just do that now, and everything you're about to see comes from the 2019 AP Government exam, including the answers I show you. So here's the concept application question from that year, and the first thing I want to mention is that you need to begin by reading the first and last sentence of the stimulus. This will give you almost everything you need to know about what's going on in the scenario provided. And here it says: "Since 2008, the Alliance Defending Freedom 捍卫自由联盟, a conservative Christian interest group 保守派基督教利益集团, has promoted an annual event known as Pulpit Freedom Sunday 讲坛自由主日. On Pulpit Freedom Sunday, as an act of civil disobedience 公民不服从行为, pastors 牧师 and religious leaders 宗教领袖 preach openly 公开宣讲 about the moral qualifications 道德资质 of candidates seeking office 竞选公职的候选人." Now once you've done that, do read the whole thing and fill in the details, but that will give you a good sense of what the whole thing is about. +

So the first thing that should occur to you 你应该想到的第一件事 after reading that is that this scenario has something to do with 与…有关 religious freedom 宗教自由 or freedom of speech 言论自由, and the potential 可能性 for this piece of legislation 法律；法规 called the Johnson Amendment 约翰逊修正案 to restrict 限制 those freedoms. Okay, so now let's look at part A: "Describe an action Congress 国会 could take to address the concerns of the interest group in the scenario." Okay, so the interest group in the scenario is not happy about the Johnson Amendment, so what action can Congress perform to address that? Remember, this has to be an action of Congress -- not the president, not the Supreme Court. So what does Congress do? Well, Congress passes laws 立法. So in this case, a suitable answer would be as follows: "Congress can pass a provision 条款 of the Johnson Amendment. The provision can allow religious leaders to speak for or against certain candidates. Therefore, the Johnson Amendment can only restrict contributions of money 资金捐助." So notice there are three sentences here, and this student earned the point because he or she acknowledged 承认 that Congress can make a law allowing religious leaders to speak freely on political candidates. And also notice how the student related the answer back to the prompt. The answer wasn't merely, "You know, Congress can pass a law" -- that would not have earned the point. No less than two times, the student ties the answer back to the Johnson Amendment. And that is it. It's a simple answer, and yet it earns the point. +

Okay, now let's move on to part B: "In the context of the scenario, explain how partisan divisions 党派分歧 could prevent the action described in part A." Okay, so let's get this straight in our heads 在我们头脑中理清思路: in part A, Congress is passing a law or a provision that allows religious leaders to speak freely about political candidates. So how might partisan divisions prevent that action? All right, here's a potential answer, and also notice that the prompt is only asking about partisan division, so you're no longer restricted to talking about Congress: "Given the increasing partisan division in the United States, this provision of the Johnson Amendment could fail if the government is divided. If Congress holds a majority of Republican representatives 共和党众议员 and the president is a Democrat, then the president could veto the law 否决该法律 and prevent the provision from passing." Okay, that gets the point. +

So now let's look at part C: "Explain why the Alliance Defending Freedom might argue that their constitutional rights 宪法权利 are threatened by the Johnson Amendment." And the student answer which earns the point reads thusly 如下: "The Alliance Defending Freedom can argue that their First Amendment rights 第一修正案权利 are being threatened by the Johnson Amendment. This is because religious leaders or organizations cannot publicly support a candidate, therefore it limits their free speech 言论自由." Okay, so the prompt asked about constitutional rights, and the student was specific: this group could argue that their First Amendment rights are being infringed 侵犯. And then the student goes on to explain why that's the case by relating it back to the prompt by showing how the Johnson Amendment could be interpreted as violating freedom of speech. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我将教你如何在美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的自由回答问题中拿到满分，具体来说是概念应用问题。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那我们就开始吧。 +

好的，当你完成选择题部分后，你会翻到下一页，映入眼帘的第一个问题就是概念应用问题。如果你修过美国大学预修历史课程（AP History course），这种题型对你来说会相当熟悉 —— 也就是说，它看起来就像你在那些课程中做过的简答题（SAQs）。所以在概念应用问题中，他们基本上是要你将在课程中学到的概念应用到一个你不了解的情境中。我再重复一遍，这样当你看到它时就不会惊慌：当你开始阅读材料时，这些材料描述的是一个实际发生的真实事件，你不应该在考试时就知道这个情境。所以，如果你开始阅读时，因为觉得这是你在学习中遗漏的内容而感到紧张，那就告诉自己：“不，你不需要知道这个情境，所以冷静下来。” 他们想让你做的是将你知道的知识应用到一个你不知道的情境中。就是这样。这并不像听起来那么难，但你确实需要一些练习。顺便说一下，如果你需要在这些问题上多做些练习，你可以获取我的终极复习资料包，里面有很多这样的问题以及评分指南来帮助你。 +

不管怎样，在阅读材料之后，你会看到问题的三个部分，标记为 A、B 和 C。对于每一个问题提示，你需要用完整的句子来回答。不要只写一个单词，也不要用要点的形式来写，要包含主语、谓语、宾语，组成完整句子。现在，如果问题提示以 “identify（识别、确定）” 这个词开头，那么你实际上只需要写一个句子说出他们所要求的内容。然而，如果你看到问题提示以其他单词开头，比如 “explain（解释）”“describe（描述）” 或 “draw a conclusion（得出结论）”，那么你需要写得更多一些，一般的经验法则是写两到三个内容丰富的句子。记住两件事：第一，具体说明你的证据；第二，将答案与问题提示联系起来。很多学生在这些问题上丢分，是因为他们的回答要么太模糊，要么没有将答案与问题提示联系起来。所以要具体，并将答案与问题提示联系起来，当我们看一个例子时，我会告诉你我的意思。 +

所以，我们现在就来看一个例子，你即将看到的所有内容都来自 2019 年的美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程考试，包括我给你展示的答案。这是当年的概念应用问题，我想提到的第一件事是，你需要从阅读材料的第一句和最后一句开始。这会让你大致了解所提供情境的主要内容。材料中是这样说的：“自 2008 年以来，捍卫自由联盟（Alliance Defending Freedom），一个保守的基督教利益集团，一直在推动一个名为‘讲坛自由星期日（Pulpit Freedom Sunday）’ 的年度活动。在‘讲坛自由星期日’，作为一种公民不服从行为，牧师和宗教领袖会公开宣讲竞选公职候选人的道德资格。” 现在，一旦你读完这些，要通读整个材料以补充细节，但开头和结尾的句子会让你对整个事件有一个很好的理解。 +

所以，在读完这些后，你首先想到的应该是，这个情境与宗教自由或言论自由有关，而且名为《约翰逊修正案（Johnson Amendment）》的这项立法有可能限制这些自由。好的，现在我们来看 A 部分：“描述国会（Congress）可以采取的解决该情境中利益集团所关注问题的行动。” 好的，情境中的利益集团对《约翰逊修正案》不满意，那么国会可以采取什么行动来解决这个问题呢？记住，这必须是国会的行动 —— 不是总统的行动，也不是最高法院（Supreme Court）的行动。那么国会能做什么呢？嗯，国会通过法律。所以在这种情况下，一个合适的答案如下：“国会可以通过《约翰逊修正案》的一项条款。该条款可以允许宗教领袖支持或反对某些候选人。因此，《约翰逊修正案》只能限制资金的捐赠。” 所以注意这里有三个句子，这个学生得到了分数，因为他或她承认国会可以制定一项法律，允许宗教领袖自由谈论政治候选人。还要注意这个学生是如何将答案与问题提示联系起来的。答案不仅仅是 “国会可以通过一项法律” —— 那样是得不到分数的。这个学生至少两次将答案与《约翰逊修正案》联系起来。就是这样。这是一个简单的答案，但它能得分。 +

好的，现在我们来看 B 部分：“在该情境的背景下，解释党派分歧如何阻止 A 部分中描述的行动。” 好的，让我们在脑海中理清楚：在 A 部分中，国会正在通过一项法律或条款，允许宗教领袖自由谈论政治候选人。那么党派分歧如何阻止这一行动呢？好的，这是一个可能的答案，并且要注意问题提示只问了党派分歧，所以你不再局限于谈论国会：“鉴于美国日益严重的党派分歧，如果政府存在分歧，《约翰逊修正案》的这项条款可能会失败。如果国会中多数是共和党众议员，而总统是民主党人，那么总统可以否决这项法律，阻止该条款通过。” 好的，这个答案能得分。 +

现在我们来看 C 部分：“解释为什么捍卫自由联盟可能会认为他们的宪法权利受到了《约翰逊修正案》的威胁。” 能得分的学生答案是这样的：“捍卫自由联盟可以认为他们的第一修正案权利受到了《约翰逊修正案》的威胁。这是因为宗教领袖或组织不能公开支持候选人，因此这限制了他们的言论自由。” 好的，问题提示问的是宪法权利，学生回答得很具体：这个团体可以认为他们的第一修正案权利受到了侵犯。然后学生通过展示《约翰逊修正案》如何被解释为侵犯言论自由，将答案与问题提示联系起来，解释了为什么会这样。 +

好的，这就是你如何回答美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程的概念应用问题。点击这里获取我的终极复习资料包，它将帮助你在课程中取得 A 的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得 5 分。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那就订阅吧，我会照做的。海姆勒，退出。 +
