well hey there and welcome back to heimler's history. in this video we're going to look in depth 深入地 at one of your foundational documents 基础文献 for ap government, namely 即；也就是 the articles of confederation 邦联条例. so if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

okay first of all, what is the articles of confederation? so glad you asked. the articles of confederation was the first constitution of the united states, and as i said in another video, historians argue about whether it should be called a constitution or a treaty 条约, but that's neither here nor there 无关紧要 for our purposes. once the united states had declared independence 宣布独立 from britain, it was without a government, so the articles solved that problem. +

before we get into the main parts of it, it'll be important for you to know what the word confederation 邦联 means. basically, it's a form of government in which several powers unite to form a central power 联合形成中央权力. in the very first days of the united states, the 13 different states formed a confederacy 邦联国家. +

now the main thing you need to know about the articles of confederation is that this governing document  governing document placed most of the power in the hands of the states at the expense of 以……为代价 the federal government 联邦政府. you can see that right away right in the opening paragraph. what do we see? a list of the states: "articles of confederation and perpetual union 永久联盟 between the states of new hampshire, massachusetts bay, rhode island and providence plantations, connecticut," etc etc. and then just in case you were confused about where the power lay, the article opens in article 2 with this little gem 重要内容 -- and as a side note 顺便说一句 this is the most important sentence in the whole document: "each state retains 保留 its sovereignty 主权, freedom and independence, in every power, jurisdiction 管辖权 and right, which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to 明确授予 the united states, in congress assembled 国会开会期间." in other words, they're saying don't get confused, the states are supreme 至高无上的 here, and unless we explicitly delegate any power to the federal congress, all of that power remains in the states. +

now once we get to article 5, we begin to see the provisions 规定 for the federal government. first of all, the articles established a single branch of the federal government, namely a legislative branch 立法部门 -- no president, no federal court. and how is that federal congress going to operate? well further along in article 5 it says: "in determining questions in the united states in congress assembled, each state shall have one vote." in other words, representation 代表权 in congress is equal among the states. a small state like new hampshire has exactly the same amount of power as a gigantic 巨大的 state like virginia. +

now if the early americans were so concerned with 担心 granting the central government too much power, why did they even form one at all? well it's because they needed a centralized government in order to do business with 与……开展事务 other nations, and we could see that in article six: "no state, without the consent of 同意 the united states in congress assembled, shall send any embassy to 派遣大使馆, or receive any embassy from, or enter into any conference, agreement, alliance 联盟 or treaty with any king, prince or state." article 6 then goes on to further restrict 限制 the power of the central government by establishing that it cannot raise a national army 组建国家军队. so where is the army or navy going to come from when it's needed? think about it on the nose 准确地 -- the states: "but every state shall always keep up 维持 a well-regulated and disciplined militia 民兵组织, sufficiently armed and accounted, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use in public stores a due number of field pieces 野战炮, tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition 弹药 and camp equipage 营地装备." +

then in article 9, it goes on to explain the powers that congress actually does have, which really isn't that much. the congress will be the final arbiter 仲裁者 in disputes between states, and fixing standard weights and measures 度量衡, and appointing committees to do its work, etc etc. then at the end of article 9 it basically says that congress can't do the major things it needs to do like declare war 宣战 unless nine states assent to 同意 the same. now 9 out of 13 would be considered a super majority 绝对多数, and that is as hard to muster 召集；集结 as it sounds. so basically from this you just need to understand that the power of congress was severely limited 严重限制 by this provision 规定. +

but the articles of confederation was even further limited by the impossibility of changing it or amending 修订 it. in article 13 it says: "nor shall any alteration 改动 at any time hereafter be made in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in the congress of the united states, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state." okay wait, it actually says that? if the articles are to be amended, it requires the agreement of every state -- 13 out of 13, the whole shebang 全部；一切, all of them. and if a super majority is hard to achieve, how easy do you think unanimity 全体一致 would be? +

anyway, the point is there are a few things that the articles achieved. first, it established a central government where there was none before. secondly, it did successfully avoid a tyrannical 专制的 central government by giving it no power. but the flaws 缺陷 in this system were legion 众多的, and that's why in 1787 delegates 代表 met at the constitutional convention 制宪会议 and ultimately drafted 起草 a new constitution. +

== 中文释义

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒历史课。在这个视频中，我们将深入研究美国大学预修课程政府学的一份基础文件，也就是《邦联条例》（the articles of confederation）。所以，如果你准备好汲取知识，那我们开始吧。 +

好的，首先，什么是《邦联条例》呢？很高兴你问这个问题。《邦联条例》是美国的第一部宪法，就像我在另一个视频中说的，历史学家们对于它应该被称为宪法还是条约存在争议，但这对于我们的目的来说无关紧要。一旦美国宣布脱离英国独立，它就没有政府，所以《邦联条例》解决了这个问题。 +

在我们深入了解它的主要内容之前，你需要知道“邦联”（confederation）这个词的含义。基本上，它是一种政府形式，在这种形式下，几个权力联合起来形成一个中央权力。在美国建国初期，13个不同的州组成了一个邦联。 +

现在，关于《邦联条例》你需要知道的主要一点是，这份治理文件把大部分权力放在了各州手中，而牺牲了联邦政府的权力。你可以从开篇段落中立刻看出这一点。我们看到了什么呢？各州的名单：“新罕布什尔州（New Hampshire）、马萨诸塞湾（Massachusetts Bay）、罗得岛和普罗维登斯种植园（Rhode Island and Providence Plantations）、康涅狄格州（Connecticut）等州之间的《邦联条例》和永久联盟”。然后，以防你对权力的归属感到困惑，条例的第二条开头是这样一句话——顺便说一下，这是整个文件中最重要的一句话：“每个州保留其主权、自由和独立，以及除本邦联明确授予合众国会的权力、管辖权和权利之外的所有权力、管辖权和权利。” 换句话说，他们是在说，别搞混了，各州在这里是至高无上的，除非我们明确将任何权力授予联邦国会，否则所有权力都归各州所有。 +

现在，当我们看到第五条时，我们开始了解联邦政府的相关规定。首先，《邦联条例》设立了联邦政府的一个分支，即立法分支——没有总统，也没有联邦法院。那么联邦国会将如何运作呢？嗯，在第五条的进一步内容中写道：“在合众国会对问题进行裁决时，每个州有一票表决权。” 换句话说，各州在国会中的代表权是平等的。像新罕布什尔州这样的小州和像弗吉尼亚州（Virginia）这样的大州拥有完全相同的权力。 +

现在，如果早期的美国人如此担心赋予中央政府太多权力，那他们为什么还要组建一个中央政府呢？嗯，这是因为他们需要一个中央政府来与其他国家进行事务往来，我们可以在第六条中看到这一点：“未经合众国会同意，任何州不得派遣任何使团前往、接受任何使团来访，或与任何国王、王子或国家签订任何会议、协议、联盟或条约。” 第六条接着进一步限制了中央政府的权力，规定中央政府不能组建国家军队。那么当需要军队时，军队或海军从哪里来呢？仔细想想——来自各州：“但每个州应始终维持一支管理良好、纪律严明的民兵，配备充足的武器并进行登记，并应提供并始终备有适当数量的野战炮、帐篷以及武器、弹药和营地装备。” +

然后在第九条中，它继续解释了国会实际拥有的权力，但这些权力并不多。国会将是各州之间争端的最终仲裁者，还包括确定标准度量衡，以及任命委员会来开展工作等等。然后在第九条的结尾基本上说，国会不能做一些它需要做的重大事情，比如宣战，除非有九个州同意。13个州中的9个州达成一致被认为是绝对多数，而这听起来就很难实现。所以，基本上从这一点你需要明白，国会的权力受到这项规定的严重限制。 +

但是《邦联条例》还受到了无法更改或修正的进一步限制。在第十三条中写道：“此后，除非经合众国会同意并随后得到每个州的立法机构确认，否则不得对其中任何条款进行任何更改。” 好的，等等，它真的是这么说的吗？如果要修正《邦联条例》，需要每个州的同意——13个州全部同意，所有的州。如果绝对多数都很难实现，你觉得全体一致通过会有多容易呢？ +

不管怎样，关键是《邦联条例》取得了一些成果。首先，它在之前没有中央政府的情况下建立了一个中央政府。其次，它通过不赋予中央政府权力成功地避免了一个暴虐的中央政府。但是这个体系存在很多缺陷，这就是为什么在1787年，代表们在制宪会议上会面，并最终起草了一部新宪法。 +

好的，这就是你需要了解的关于《邦联条例》的内容。点击这里可以查看一个播放列表，它解释了这门课程的所有基础文件，如果你想在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分，那么点击这里获取我的复习资料包。下次再见，海姆勒退场。 +
