Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. In this video, we're going to be looking at yet another one of your required Supreme Court cases 最高法院案例 for the AP Government curriculum 课程, namely 也就是 Schenck v. the United States 申克诉美国案. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +  

So as always, let's begin with the facts of the case. In 1917, Congress passed a law called the Espionage Act 《反间谍法》, and its purpose in part was to outlaw 取缔 any hindrances 阻碍 to military recruitment 征兵. Now this was right smack in the middle of America's involvement in World War One, and the draft 征兵 had just started that year. So a guy by the name of Charles Schenck, who was a member of the Socialist Party 社会党 in Philadelphia, was not a big fan of the military draft. So he wrote up a pamphlet 小册子 which encouraged young American men to resist 抵制 the draft. In the pamphlet, Schenck claimed that the draft was nothing more than intimidation 恐吓 that required resistance, and said that it was really no different than a form of involuntary servitude 强迫劳役, which of course was outlawed by the 13th Amendment 第十三修正案. Schenck went ahead and distributed 分发 something like 15,000 of these pamphlets, after which he was summarily 立即地 arrested and sent to trial for breaking the law -- which is to say the Espionage Act -- and after the ruling was appealed 上诉, the case ended up before the Supreme Court. +  

So what was the constitutional principle 宪法原则 at stake 处于危险中 in this case? Well, it was clear that Schenck had violated 违反 the Espionage Act, but he argued back that his First Amendment 第一修正案 right to free speech was violated, and therefore that section of the Espionage Act was unconstitutional 违宪的. In Schenck's mind, he had every right to protest the war, and if the government silenced his dissent 异议, it would be a tyrannical 专制的 government overreach 权力过度扩张. So was he right? Well, let's look at the decision the court handed down. +  

As it turns out, the court did not agree with Mr. Schenck. The court ruled in a unanimous decision 一致裁决 that Schenck's First Amendment rights were not violated because he wasn't merely protesting the draft. Instead, his words were actively encouraging men to avoid the draft, and that was something different altogether. And at the end of the day, it was not protected speech. And why not? Because as Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in his majority opinion 多数意见: "The most stringent 严格的 protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic 恐慌. The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger 明显且即刻的危险 that they will bring about the substantive evils 实质性危害 that Congress has a right to prevent." And that phrase -- "clear and present danger" -- created a test 标准 by which protected and unprotected speech can be measured. +  

Like it's clear that if you yell fire in a crowded theater and everyone freaks out 惊慌失措 and tramples each other 互相踩踏 and maybe gets injured in order to leave, that cannot fall under the protection of the First Amendment. In doing that, you have caused harm to others by your words which have induced 引发 a clear and present danger to their health and well-being. +  

So now let's consider why this case matters. First of all, it matters because it created a very clear standard 标准 for the silencing of speech. In this case, Holmes mentioned in his written opinion that the government has more right to infringe upon 侵犯 the right to free speech during a time of war because, quote, "many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance 阻碍 to its effort that their utterance 言论 will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right." So the clear and present danger test emerged out of this case to be applied to such situations. +  

However, the clear and present danger test is no longer used, and it has been superseded by 被取代 the Brandenburg test 布兰登堡测试, which makes a clear distinction 区分 between the intent 意图 of speech and its likelihood to incite 煽动 lawless activity 非法活动. In other words, if it's clear that the speech did not intend to incite lawless action, then even if it is incendiary 煽动性的 and offensive 冒犯性的, the speech is usually protected. And really what you should remember here is that the Brandenburg test set an even higher bar 门槛 for the government to clear before silencing speech. +

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我们将探讨美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中另一个必修的最高法院案例，即“申克诉美国案（Schenck v. the United States）”。所以，如果你准备好激发自己的思维，那就让我们开始吧。 +  

一如既往，我们先从案件事实讲起。1917年，国会通过了一项名为《Espionage Act（反间谍法）》的法律，其部分目的是将任何阻碍征兵的行为定为非法。当时正值美国参与第一次世界大战的中期，而征兵制那年刚刚开始。因此，一位名叫查尔斯·申克（Charles Schenck）的费城社会党（Socialist Party）成员，非常反对征兵制。于是他撰写了一份小册子，鼓励美国年轻男性抵制征兵。在小册子中，申克声称征兵只不过是需要抵制的恐吓行为，并表示这与《第十三修正案》（13th Amendment）所禁止的非自愿劳役并无不同。申克随后分发了约1.5万份此类小册子，之后他立即因违反《反间谍法》被捕并受审——在裁决被上诉后，案件最终提交至最高法院。 +  

本案涉及的宪法原则是什么呢？显然，申克违反了《反间谍法》，但他辩称自己的宪法第一修正案（First Amendment）言论自由权受到了侵犯，因此《反间谍法》的相关条款是违宪的。在申克看来，他完全有权抗议战争，如果政府压制他的异议，那就是政府的专制越权。那么他说得对吗？我们来看看法院的判决。 +  

事实证明，法院并不认同申克先生的观点。最高法院以一致裁决认定，申克的第一修正案权利并未受到侵犯，因为他不仅仅是在抗议征兵。相反，他的言论是在积极鼓励人们逃避征兵，这完全是另一回事，最终不属于受保护的言论。为什么呢？正如奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯（Oliver Wendell Holmes）在多数意见中所写：“对言论自由最严格的保护，也不会保护一个在剧院里虚假呼喊‘着火了’并引起恐慌的人。每个案件的关键在于，所用的语言是否在特定情境下、以某种性质构成了明确且现实的危险（clear and present danger），即它们将导致国会有权防止的实质性危害。” 而“明确且现实的危险”这一短语，确立了衡量受保护言论与不受保护言论的标准。 +  

很明显，如果你在拥挤的剧院里大喊“着火了”，导致所有人惊慌失措、互相踩踏，甚至可能在逃生时受伤，这种言论就不能受到第一修正案的保护。在这种情况下，你的言论通过制造对他人健康和安全的明确且现实的危险，已经对他人造成了伤害。 +  

现在我们来思考这个案件为何重要。首先，它为限制言论确立了一个非常明确的标准。霍姆斯在其书面意见中提到，政府在战争时期更有权限制言论自由，因为“许多在和平时期可以说的话，在战争时期会严重阻碍国家的努力，只要人们还在战斗，这些言论就不会被容忍，任何法院都不会将其视为受宪法权利保护的内容。” 因此，“明确且现实的危险”标准正是源于本案，并适用于此类情形。 +  

然而，“明确且现实的危险”标准已不再使用，它已被“布兰登堡标准（Brandenburg test）”所取代，后者对言论的意图及其煽动非法活动的可能性进行了明确区分。换句话说，如果有明确证据表明言论并非旨在煽动非法行动，那么即使该言论具有煽动性和冒犯性，通常也会受到保护。这里你需要记住的是，“布兰登堡标准”为政府在限制言论前需满足的条件设定了更高的门槛。 +  

以上就是你需要了解的关于“申克诉美国案”的内容。如果你想要一份有助于你在课堂上取得A的成绩并在五月份的考试中获得5分的复习资料包，请点击这里。此外，我制定了一个“海姆勒测试”来决定是否继续制作这些视频：如果你订阅，我就会继续制作。我说完了。 +
