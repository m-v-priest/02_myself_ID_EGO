Hey there, and welcome back to Heimler's History. Now in this video, I'm getting all cranked up 兴奋起来；激动起来 to show you how to answer the quantitative data FRQ 定量数据自由回答问题 for AP Government. So if you're ready to get them brain cells milked with data, let's get to it. +

All right, well let's just jump right in 直接开始. Now in the quantitative data FRQ, they're going to present you with a visual stimulus 视觉材料 which will be in the form of 以…形式 a graph 图表 or a chart 图表 or a map or some other representation of numbers 数字的其他呈现方式, and your job is to interpret 解读 those numbers and answer the four prompts 题目 that they give you. And look, just between you and me 私下说, this is probably the easiest of the three FRQs. So if you're the kind of person who tends to overthink things 过度思考, then grab your brain by the shoulders, slap it in the face, and say, "Stop it." +

Okay, now after the stimulus, you'll see four parts to the question labeled A, B, C, and D. And the advice I have for the quantitative data question is the same I had for the concept application question 概念应用问题: for each of those prompts, you need to write your answers in complete sentences 完整句子. Don't just throw a single word in there or write in bullet points 要点列表. If the prompt begins with the word "identify 识别；指出", then you really only need one sentence naming what they're asking for. If you see a prompt beginning with any other word like "explain 解释" or "describe 描述" or whatever, then you're gonna need to write a little bit more, and the general rule of thumb 经验法则 is two to three content-rich sentences 内容丰富的句子. And remember two things: be specific with your evidence 证据具体, and relate it back to the prompt 紧扣题目. +

Okay, enough with that. Let's look at the quantitative data question from the 2021 AP Government exam, and I'll show you how to earn all the points. First, have a look at this chart that they give you. They're comparing House elections 众议院选举 in Ohio in 1982 and 2012. You can see here in 1982 that the two circles are just about the same -- the same amount of representatives who got votes also got seats in the House 众议院席位, and that makes perfect sense. But in 2012, it's a different story. Here, Democrats 民主党 won 48 percent of the votes but only got 25 percent of the seats, to which I say, "What?" So something strange is going on here, and you bet your sweet bippy （俚语，你可以肯定）that they're going to ask me to explain that weirdness 怪异现象. +

But before they ask me to do all that explaining, they're gonna give us two soft-toss questions 送分题. And seriously, letters A and B are just really free points if you can understand the numbers that they give you. Look at A: "Identify the party that won the highest percentage of votes and seats in 1982." Remember, slap that overactive brain in the face -- this is just as easy as it sounds. 1982, who won the most votes and seats? As you can see here, clearly it's the Democrats. And since the prompt begins with "identify," all you have to do is name the party. But you're not just going to write "Democrats" and then move on to part B. You're going to write it in a complete sentence: "The Democrats won the highest percentage of votes and seats in 1982." Done. I just earned that point. +

Now part B: "Describe a change between the percentage of seats won by Republicans 共和党 in 1982 and 2012." Okay, it's clear that there is a change, so now we just need to describe what we see in words. So you could say something like this: "In 1982, the same proportion of representatives who earned votes won seats in the House. However, in 2012, roughly 大致 half of the Democrats who received votes won seats in the House." And that's it. I just earned the point. All I did was describe what I saw in the pie charts 饼状图. +

Okay, now that your confidence is disproportionately 不成比例地 high, they're about to come in and bring you down back to earth 让你回到现实. So if you slapped your brain in the face earlier, now is the time to repent 后悔 and make up 弥补, because you're going to need it for parts C and D, which are going to ask you for an explanation of those changes. Part C says: "Draw a conclusion 得出结论 about the difference in percentage of votes won and seats won in Ohio in the 2012 election as shown in the chart." Okay, when the AP overlords AP考试出题者 say "draw a conclusion," they want you to tie all the evidence together 把所有证据联系起来 and provide an explanation for it. So let's do that in two sentences. First sentence: "There was a significant difference between House elections in 1982 and 2012." All right, easy enough. Now let's explain why that might have occurred: "The difference in votes and seats won in 1982 and 2012 suggests that partisan gerrymandering 党派不公正划分选区 on the part of Republicans could have played a role." +

Okay, so you drew a conclusion and then you explained a potential cause for that conclusion. Now let's move on to part D, which says this: "Explain why the information in the charts could pose a challenge to 对…构成挑战 participatory democracy 参与式民主." Okay, now here's what really pays to know your vocabulary 词汇很重要. Like, they don't tell you what participatory democracy is -- they just assume you know. And since it's mentioned explicitly 明确地 in the curriculum 课程, they can assume that. So in this case, if you don't know, participatory democracy emphasizes the voice and role of ordinary citizens in the political process 强调普通公民在政治过程中的声音和作用. So if we're right that gerrymandering had occurred, then how might that challenge participatory democracy? Well, how about this: "The data in the chart show that Republicans earned roughly the same amount of votes in both years but won a disproportionate amount of seats in 2012. If this is a result of gerrymandering, this can challenge participatory democracy by weakening people's political efficacy 削弱人们的政治效能. If voters think the system is rigged 被操纵的 and thus their vote does not count 不起作用, they will be less likely to vote in future elections, and participatory democracy will diminish 减弱." +

Okay, so notice two things about this answer. Number one, it answers the prompt by demonstrating how these numbers and how gerrymandering might affect participatory democracy. And second, it makes sure to tie the answer back to the prompt. Always, always, always tie your answer back to the prompt. +

All right, that's the quantitative data FRQ for AP Government. Click right here to grab my Ultimate Review Packet, which is going to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May.

嘿，欢迎回到海姆勒（Heimler）的历史频道。在这个视频中，我满怀热情地准备向你展示如何回答美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中与定量数据相关的自由回答问题（FRQ）。所以，如果你准备好用数据来激发你的脑细胞，那我们就开始吧。 +

好的，让我们直接切入重点。在定量数据的自由回答问题中，他们会给你呈现一个视觉材料，其形式可能是图表、图示或者地图，或者是其他数字呈现方式，你的任务是解读这些数字，并回答他们给出的四个问题。听着，私下跟你说，这可能是三个自由回答问题中最容易的一个。所以，如果你是那种容易过度思考的人，那就抓住你的大脑，扇它一巴掌，然后说：“别想太多了。” +

好的，在呈现材料之后，你会看到问题的四个部分，分别标记为 A、B、C 和 D。我对定量数据问题的建议和对概念应用问题的建议是一样的：对于每一个问题提示，你需要用完整的句子来回答。不要只写一个单词，也不要用要点的形式来写。如果问题提示以 “identify（识别、确定）” 这个词开头，那么你实际上只需要用一个句子说出他们所要求的内容。如果你看到问题提示以其他单词开头，比如 “explain（解释）”“describe（描述）” 或者其他词，那么你需要写得更多一些，一般的经验法则是写两到三个内容丰富的句子。记住两件事：具体说明你的证据，并且将其与问题提示联系起来。 +

好啦，说够这些了。让我们看看 2021 年美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程考试中的定量数据问题，我会告诉你如何拿到所有的分数。首先，看看他们给你的这个图表。他们在比较 1982 年和 2012 年俄亥俄州（Ohio）的众议院选举情况。你可以看到，在 1982 年，两个数据差不多 —— 获得选票的众议员数量和在众议院获得席位的数量是一样的，这很合理。但在 2012 年，情况就不同了。在这里，民主党（Democrats）赢得了 48% 的选票，但只获得了 25% 的席位，我就想问：“这是什么情况？” 所以这里有点奇怪，而且可以肯定的是，他们会让我解释这种奇怪的现象。 +

但在他们让我做所有这些解释之前，他们会先给我们两个简单的问题。说真的，如果能理解他们给的数据，A 和 B 部分的分数真的很容易拿到。看看 A 部分：“确定在 1982 年赢得最高选票百分比和席位的政党。” 记住，别想太多 —— 这真的像听起来那么简单。1982 年，哪个政党赢得了最多的选票和席位呢？从这里可以清楚地看到，是民主党。因为问题提示以 “identify” 开头，所以你只需要说出这个政党的名字。但你不能只写 “民主党” 然后就进入 B 部分。你得用完整的句子写：“1982 年，民主党赢得了最高的选票百分比和席位。” 这样就完成了，我就拿到了这一分。 +

现在看 B 部分：“描述 1982 年和 2012 年共和党（Republicans）赢得的席位百分比之间的变化。” 好的，很明显这里存在变化，所以现在我们只需要用语言描述我们看到的情况。所以你可以这样说：“1982 年，获得选票的众议员比例和在众议院赢得席位的比例是相同的。然而，在 2012 年，获得选票的民主党人中大约只有一半在众议院赢得了席位。” 就是这样，我又拿到了这一分。我所做的只是描述了我在饼状图中看到的情况。 +

好的，现在你的信心可能有点过度膨胀了，他们马上就会让你回到现实。所以，如果你之前扇了你的大脑一巴掌，现在是时候反思并弥补了，因为对于 C 和 D 部分的问题，你需要用到这些。C 部分说：“根据图表所示，对 2012 年俄亥俄州选举中赢得的选票百分比和席位百分比之间的差异得出结论。” 好的，当 AP 课程的主导者说 “得出结论” 时，他们是希望你把所有证据联系起来并给出解释。所以我们用两个句子来完成。第一句：“1982 年和 2012 年的众议院选举之间存在显著差异。” 好的，很简单。现在让我们解释一下为什么会出现这种情况：“1982 年和 2012 年在选票和席位上的差异表明，共和党方面的选区重划（gerrymandering）可能起到了作用。” +

好的，所以你得出了一个结论，然后解释了这个结论的潜在原因。现在让我们进入 D 部分，它是这样说的：“解释为什么图表中的信息会对参与式民主（participatory democracy）构成挑战。” 好的，在这里，了解词汇真的很重要。他们不会告诉你什么是参与式民主 —— 他们认为你应该知道。由于这在课程中是明确提到的，所以他们可以这样认为。所以在这种情况下，如果你不知道，参与式民主强调普通公民在政治过程中的声音和作用。那么，如果我们认为选区重划确实发生了，那它是如何对参与式民主构成挑战的呢？可以这样回答：“图表中的数据显示，共和党在这两年中赢得的选票数量大致相同，但在 2012 年赢得了不成比例的席位。如果这是选区重划的结果，那么它会削弱人们的政治效能，从而对参与式民主构成挑战。如果选民认为这个系统被操纵了，因此他们的选票没有意义，那么他们在未来选举中投票的可能性就会降低，参与式民主就会减弱。” +

好的，注意这个答案的两点。第一，它通过展示这些数据以及选区重划如何影响参与式民主来回答问题提示。第二，它确保将答案与问题提示联系起来。一定要始终将你的答案与问题提示联系起来。 +

好啦，这就是美国大学预修课程（AP）政府课程中与定量数据相关的自由回答问题。点击这里获取我的终极复习资料包，它将帮助你在课堂上取得 A 的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得 5 分。如果这个视频对你有帮助，并且你希望我继续制作这样的视频，那就通过订阅告诉我吧。海姆勒，退出。 +
