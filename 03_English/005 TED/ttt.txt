growing up in the 80s I was obsessed

with the Superman movies I just wanted

to be lowest Lane so much so you can

imagine how excited I was when I got my

first real job in the media working for

a national news program here in London

and to be a good journalist I knew I had

to channel my inner Lois I had to work

really fast I had to work really well

under intense pressure and I had to be

ruthless when chasing a story

and I discovered that I was really bad

at all of those things so I didn't last

too long in The Newsroom but I did get a

brilliant insight into how the media

works when we would cover issues like

poverty stories of pain and Trauma were

always more likely to make it on air

that's because they grab people's

attention and when I moved to

campaigning for journalism I realized

that we campaigners are just as hooked

on those stories as our journalists are

because they are very effective at

creating

awareness but here's the catch as

campaigners we don't just want awareness

we want change and although stories of

pain they move us they over time leave

us feeling hopeless and

stuck and that's what I want to talk to

you about

today why is it that we communicators

are so hooked on these stories is it

because they drive engagement or is it

because there's something deeper going

on with us and these are the questions

that have really guided my work over the

last 20 years as I've explored different

ways of telling stories that don't just

create awareness but that Inspire action

and

hope

right right now in terms of all of the

media that we consume and I know you're

going to relate to this we are swimming

in what I think should be the F-word of

communications

can you

guess

fatalism fatalism makes us think like

nothing will change and there's no point

even

trying in 2012 the nspcc commissioned

some research that's the UK's leading

Child Abuse Prevention

charity and it showed that the majority

of us in the UK are aware of how

widespread and horrific child

abuses largely due to the way that

campaign have told stories over the

years but it showed that we are hopeless

we are overwhelmed by the magnitude of

the issue and we don't really feel like

anything can be done to change

it and fatalism is a big problem for us

as campaigners because if the public

feels hopeless about an issue there just

isn't the energy or the appetite to push

for

Change and it was about sort of 12 years

ago that I realized I think my work is

actually a part of the problem

I had set up a charity called herd in

2008 which now takes an issue like

climate and works with TV producers and

campaigners to make sure that stories

land in a way that audiences feel change

as

possible but in the early days one of

our first projects was working with

survivors of sexual

abuse and I remember this moment so

clearly we were doing some media

training and we were working with a

campaigner called Jane who was and is

still pushing for greater transparency

in how the church handles uh reporting

of abuse and we were doing media

training and our media training you know

it did have a real focus on pastoral

care and boundaries and safety but we

relied on the same approach that I had

learned in journalism which was you know

we lead with a focus on what happened

because we knew journalists would would

lead with that that's what they'd want

to

ask so we asked that question of Jane

and she told her story and it was

incredibly powerful and

moving but by the time she got to her

call for change she was feeling

emotionally drained and we were all

feeling it with

her in terms of our emotional experience

as her audience it was the detail of her

trauma that stuck with us whereas her

insight and her ideas and her Solutions

sort of got lost and I thought to myself

this is how we audiences feel all the

time you know when we're scrolling or

we're watching the

news and so it was a negative experience

for Jane but also she didn't her message

wasn't even Landing in the way that she

wanted to so we tried something

different and we asked her let's do this

interview again but this time

acknowledge your experience as you did

before but then pivot quickly to the

broader picture to get the audien's

focus on where you want this interview

to go and I'm going to play you a short

clip to show you what that initial

response sounded like Jame could you

tell us a little bit about what happened

to you um well I'm I'm I'm a Survivor of

um abuse by member of the clergy uh and

um what I realized when I've um met with

other survivors of clerical abuse is

that doesn't just uh affect you as a

person it affects your your beliefs and

particularly your belief in God um and

your your trust in the church and I

think that's the same as with other

institutions you know so you go to the

doctor and you expect that you will be

helped and that they'll keep you safe

and you send your child to school and

you expect that the teacher will look

after them and if if something bad

happens then then you lose trust in that

institution um and we need to trust our

institutions because they're there to

look after us so Jane does three things

here which are really important she

acknowledges her

experience then she zooms out and refers

to other survivors so emotionally her

audience can't dismiss this as a one-off

which is what we do to protect ourselves

then she makes it relatable to anyone

listening by referring to schools and

doctors we still know and care about her

suffering this is not sugar coating this

is about Focus Jane now has our focus on

where she wants us to go in this case

this is about the steps that

institutions need to take in order to

regain our trust and it feels much

better for Jane

now this shift from leading with pain to

Leading with universal relevance made me

rethink our approach to storytelling and

campaigning and it also made me

wonder why is it that given the research

that's out there like the nspcc report

and there are many other studies that

show the same thing on all sorts of

issues that trauma focused campaigning

does not work in the way that we think

it does why then do we keep focusing on

trauma in our

Communications what's making us pull our

campaigns our campaigners like Jane and

our audiences into what's known as the

drama

triangle I think understanding more

about ourselves is really key

here Cartman's drama triangle some of

you will be familiar with this it's a

very popular uh idea used in

Psychotherapy to understand unhealthy

communication Dynamics in our personal

relationships and our work relationships

you know we all do it and there are

three roles Cartman describes them as

victim rescuer and persecutor I'm using

an adapted version that I think works

better in this

context now these roles we can all

assume them usually at times of anxiety

and

stress when we are in suffer mode we are

problem focused right we feel like

something is happening to us and we can

solve we can't get out of the

situation when we are in rescuer mode we

feel like other people are in need of

our help whether that's true or not and

we need to go in and sort everything out

that's our job that's our role I can

sense the nods in the room I know this

audience um and the third role is blamer

mode so no judgment I'm pretty sure I

was in blamer mode this morning because

I couldn't find my charger on the way

here and blamer mode is Mo you're

mobilized by anger it's someone else's

fault and you want to control the

situation so none of these roles they're

not in they none of them are inherently

bad um we all bounce between them even

in the same conversation but the thing

is if we're consistently having

conversations in the drama triangle

we're trapped in anxiety and we can't

get out now this is helpful to

understand more about ourselves but I

think it's really interesting if we look

at our communication strategies through

this lens and here's

why when we create a campaign whether

we're a journalist or a fundraiser or a

campaigner and when we work with a

campaigner like Jane and when we lead

with a focus on what happened to her the

detail of her

trauma we are essentially casting Jane

and her message in the sufferer role

even though she wants to be talking

about Solutions you know sufferer role

is is problem focused the same applies

if we create a message about how bad the

climate crisis is and we lead with the

focus on how awful things are it's in

the sufferer

role and so I think our audiences we are

dragging them into the drama triangle

too by Leading with this information we

do it intentionally because we think

it's going to move people you know we

have good

intentions but faced with a message that

makes you feel fearful or anxious as the

audience you got Limited options here

you might

feel like rescuer like oh how awful

those poor people are how terrible so

pity that's in rescuer mode or you might

feel angry and overwhelmed by what

you're hearing like whose fault is this

or that wouldn't happen to me you know I

wouldn't have done that you're mobilized

by

anger but what if we could escape the

drama triangle in our

Communications David Emerald designed

the empowerment dynamic in his words as

a place to go if you want to get out of

drama in your

relationships and I think this is

interesting instead of the sufferer role

he has the Creator role this is where

Jane was in the clip that I just showed

you when we are in Creator and this is

Jane you acknowledge the problem yeah

we're not sugar coating anything we

acknowledge it but we lead with

Solutions when we're in Creator we know

how to speak in a way that people can

hear us not necessarily that they'll

agree with our Solutions this isn't

about consensus this is about

dialogue and so in response to a Creator

in a conversation you might respond

creatively too or you might respond as

coach so not rescuer you're not swooping

in to solve things coach Emeral

describes as supportive and

curious or we might respond as

Challenger not mobilized by anger like

blamer ch Aller is analytical

open-minded inquisitive Challenger can

push but it's

constructive there is positive energy

here in the empowerment

Dynamic and when we look at our

communication strategies through this

lens I think that audiences can receive

messages like climate that they don't

feel like this Unstoppable disaster that

we have no control over but instead we

can see them as challenges I mean these

are these are Big challenges but we can

engage with them because we can actually

hear what's

required and I also think that

campaigners like Jane and I've met

hundreds of them campaigners like Jane

are no longer seen solely through the

lens of

Injustice they're seen for the experts

that they are with Insight ideas

Solutions

creativity their trauma isn't minded for

clicks and the emotions of our audiences

aren't being manipulated for clicks

instead we're able to engage and feel a

sense of what's

possible and I've seen this approach

work again and again an recent example

that I absolutely love is breast cancer

now's gallery of Hope campaign in this

campaign they show beautiful photography

of women with incurable cancer and

generated by AI they show future

photographs of them in the future that

they hope to have because of the

research that's happening right now and

these interviews with these women these

are still personal stories they still

get the hairs on the back of your neck

standing up and the tears in your eyes

but this time it's not because you're so

overwhelmed with how awful it's because

you are moved by what's possible by the

future that we all

want another example of escape from the

drama triangle that resulted in a change

change in legislation was Ireland's

equal marriage

campaign I met the campaigners there

they got together and they made a

conscious decision that instead of

spotlighting trauma and Injustice they

would focus on sharing stories of

acceptance for example they had Granny's

and grandads across the country share

videos about their grandchildren they

just wanted them to have the same rights

to marriages they

had the nspcc research and many other

studies like it they show that stories

of pain whether they're personal stories

or whether they're Vivid depictions of a

problem they're very good at creating

awareness but they're highly likely to

leave audiences emotionally reaching for

their coats even if they

donate even if they're now more aware of

the problem than they were

before but when we treat our audiences

and don't traumatize them we leave them

engaged leaning in ready to learn so

here's my invitation to you the next

time you craft a campaign or a

newsletter or the next time you have a

challenging conversation with a loved

one or a colleague ask yourself which

triangle am I in drama or empowerment am

I leaving my intended audience feeling

defensive and anxious or am I leaving

them feeling curious and

engaged because if you like me are

passionate about creating a healthier

and more just

future we can't just be in the business

of awareness we have to be in the

business of change thank you so much
