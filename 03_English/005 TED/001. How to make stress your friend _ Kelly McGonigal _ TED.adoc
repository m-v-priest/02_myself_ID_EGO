I have a confession 供词；供状；认罪；供认；坦白 to make.

But first, I want you to make
a little confession to me.

In the past year,
I want you to just raise (v.)提起，举起 your hand +
if you've experienced (v.) relatively little stress.

Anyone?

How about a moderate 普通的，中等的 amount of stress?

Who has experienced a lot of stress?

Yeah. Me too.

But that is not my confession.

My confession is this: +
I am a health psychologist,

and my mission is to help people
be happier and healthier.

But I fear that  +
something I've been teaching for the last 10 years +
is doing more harm than good, +
and it *has to do with* stress.

[.my1]
.案例
====
"and it has to do with stress" 的意思是：“这与压力有关。” +
"it" 是指代前文提到的“something I’ve been teaching for the last 10 years”（我过去10年里教授的内容）。 +
*"has to do with" 是一个固定表达，意思是“与……有关”或“涉及……”。*

这里的 "and it has to do with stress" 表明：
演讲者发现自己教授的内容（过去10年中教授的某种理念或方法）涉及到压力（stress），并且可能对压力的某些看法或处理方式是有问题的。

- What does this question *have to do with* me? （这个问题和我有什么关系？）
- Does this decision *have to do with* the budget cuts? （这个决定是否与预算削减有关？）
- The book *has nothing to do with* the movie. （这本书和电影毫无关系。）

====

For years I've been telling people,
stress makes you sick.

It increases the risk of everything +
from the common cold +
to cardiovascular  (a.)心血管的 disease.

Basically, I've turned stress +
into the enemy.

[.my2]
基本上我把压力当作敌人

But I have changed my mind about stress, +
and today, I want to change yours.

Let me start with the study +
that made me rethink +
my whole approach 方法，态度 to stress.

This study tracked 30,000 adults +
in the United States for eight years, +
and they started by asking people, +

"How much stress have you
experienced in the last year?"

They also asked, +
"Do you believe that stress
is harmful for your health?"

And then they used public death records
to find out who died.

(Laughter)

Okay.

Some bad news first.

People who experienced a lot of stress
in the previous year  +
had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.

But that was only true for the people +
who also believed that stress
is harmful for your health.

(Laughter)

People who experienced a lot of stress +
but did not view stress as harmful +
were no more likely 不太可能 to die.

In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying +
of anyone in the study, +
including people +
who had relatively little stress.

[.my2]
事实上，与"压力相对较小的研究参与者"相比, 这样的人死亡风险反而最低

Now the researchers estimated that  +
over the eight years they were tracking deaths, +
182,000 Americans died prematurely (ad.)过早地, +
*not* from stress, +
*but* from the belief 看法，信念，观点 that stress is bad for you.

(Laughter)

That is over 20,000 deaths a year.

Now, if that estimate is correct, +
that would make _believing stress is bad for you_ +
`宾补`  the 15th largest cause of death +
in the United States last year,

[.my2]
若估计正确, 「相信压力有害」就成为美国去年的第15大死因.

killing more people than skin cancer,
HIV/AIDS and homicide.

(Laughter)

You can see why this study *freaked* (v.)（使）强烈反应，震惊，畏惧 me *out*.

Here I've been spending
so much energy telling (v.) people +
stress is bad for your health.

So this study got me wondering: +
Can changing how you think about stress `谓` make you healthier?

And here the science says yes.

When you change your mind about stress, +
you can change
your body's response to stress.

Now to explain how this works,

I want you all to pretend that  +
you are participants in a study  +
designed *to stress* （使）焦虑不安，疲惫不堪 you *out*.

It's called the social stress test.

You come into the laboratory, +
and you're told you have *to give* +
a five-minute impromptu (a.)即兴的，即席的 speech +
on your personal weaknesses +
*to* _a panel （广播、电视上的）讨论小组 of_ expert evaluators 评价者；评估人
sitting right in front of you, +
and to make sure you feel the pressure,

there are bright lights +
and a camera in your face, +
kind of like this.

[.my2]
有点像现在这样!

(Laughter)

And the evaluators 评价者；评估人 have been trained +
to give you discouraging 使人沮丧的；令人气馁的, non-verbal 非语言的 feedback,

like this.

(Exhales)

(Laughter)

Now that you're sufficiently demoralized (a.v.)使士气低落, +
time for part two: a math test.

[.my2]
第二部分上场的时间到了

And unbeknownst  (a.ad.)不为所知的，不知道的 to you, +
the experimenter has been trained
to harass (v.)骚扰；不断攻击（敌人） you during it.

Now we're going to all do this together.

It's going to be fun. +
For me. +

(Laughter)

Okay. +
I want you all to count (v.) backwards (ad.)向后；倒转 from 996 +
in increments 增量;（尤指连续、定量的）增长 of seven.

[.my2]
现在你们开始倒数,
从996开始，每数一个数减7



You're going to do this *out loud* 大声地，响亮地,
as fast as you can, +
starting with 996.

Go!

(Audience counting)

Go faster. Faster please.

You're going too slow. +
(Audience counting)

Stop. Stop, stop, stop. +
That guy made a mistake. +
We are going to have to start (v.)
all over again.

(Laughter)

You're not very good at this, are you?

Okay, so you get the idea.

If you were actually in this study, +
you'd probably be a little *stressed out* 紧张的，焦虑的.

Your heart might be pounding (v.) 重击；重击声, +
you might be breathing (v.) faster,
maybe *breaking out* 突被布满某物 into a sweat  流汗，出汗.

[.my1]
.案例
====
breaking out into a sweat, 为什么有 a?  +
"sweat" 虽然是不可数名词，但在表达具体的一次流汗、出汗的状态时，可以用 "a sweat"。  +
这类似于英语中一些不可数名词, 在特定场景下, 变为可数的现象，用以指代具体的一次事件或一种状态。

- She broke into a sweat during the test.（她在考试中突然开始出汗。）
====

And normally, we *interpret* (v.)解释，说明；把……理解为
these physical changes *as* anxiety +
or signs that we aren't *coping*
very well *with* the pressure.

But what if you *viewed* them instead
*as* signs 后定 that your body was energized （使）充满热情；给（某人）增添能量,
was preparing you to meet (v.) this challenge?

[.my2]
但若将这些现象当成身体活力充沛的象征, 表示已准备好迎接挑战，又会怎样呢?

Now *that is exactly* what participants 参与者 were told +
in a study conducted at Harvard University.

[.my2]
在哈佛大学所进行的一项研究中, 那么, 他们正是这样告诉受试者的

[.my1]
.案例
====
.*Now* that is exactly what participants were told…
这里的 "now" 起的是话题转换,或强调的作用.

可以理解为以下几种意思：

-> “那么”
用于引出或总结一个关键点，类似于汉语中的“那么”, 或“现在我要告诉你重点了”。 +
Now, let's look at what this really means.
（那么，让我们看看这实际上意味着什么。）

-> “确实”/“就是”
用来强调接下来的内容的真实性或重要性。 +
Now, that’s what I call a great idea!
（这才叫好主意！）
====

Before they went through 经历、经受,或完成某事 the social stress test, +
they were taught *to rethink*
their _stress response_ *as* helpful.

[.my2]
在社会压力测试开始前, 受试者学着将"压力反应"当作"助力"

That _pounding heart_
is preparing (v.) you for action.

If you're breathing faster,
it's no problem. +
It's getting more oxygen to your brain.

And participants who learned *to view* (v.)
the stress response
*as* helpful for their performance, +
well, they were less *stressed out* 紧张的，焦虑的,
less anxious, more confident,

but `主` _the most fascinating finding_ to me
`系` was  +
how their _physical stress response_ 生理应激反应 changed.

Now, in a typical _stress response_ 应激反应,压力反应 , +
your _heart rate_ *goes up*, +
and your blood vessels
constrict (v.)（使）紧缩，缩窄 like this.

And this is one of the reasons +
that _chronic stress_ 慢性应激
is sometimes *associated (a.) with* cardiovascular 心血管的 disease.

It's not really healthy  +
*to be in this state* all the time.
[.my2]
总是如此的话，对健康不是好事


But in the study, +
when participants *viewed* (v.)
their stress response *as* helpful, +
their blood vessels
stayed (v.) relaxed like this.

Their heart *was still pounding*, +
but this is a much healthier
cardiovascular profile 外形；轮廓;印象；形象.

It actually *looks a lot like* what happens
in moments of joy and courage 勇气，胆量.

Over a lifetime of _stressful experiences_, +
`主` this one biological change `系` could be the difference +
*between* _a stress-induced heart attack_ at age 50 +
*and* living (v.) well into your 90s.

[.my2]
要克服人生中的各种压力, 这样的生理差异足已产生"50岁时，因压力导致心脏病发"以及"健康活到 90多岁"的区别

And this is really _what the new science of stress reveals (v.)_,
that _how you think about stress `谓` matters_ (v.).

[.my2]
最新的压力研究结果便是如此, 如何看待压力, 是至关重要的.

So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. +
I no longer want *to get rid of* your stress. +
I want to make you better at stress.

And we just did a little intervention.

If you *raised your hand* and said
you'd had a lot of stress
in the last year, +
we could have saved your life, +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.we could have saved your life
**"could have + 过去分词" 的结构，表示一种对过去的假设，意思是“我们本来能够拯救你的生命，但实际上并没有做到”。**这种用法常用于描述过去可能发生, 但实际上未发生的情况。

- *You could have won the race* if you had run faster.
（如果你跑得快点，你本来可以赢得比赛。）
- *You could have told me* you were coming.
（你本来可以告诉我, 你要来的。）
- *I could have helped you* if you had asked.
（如果你请求的话，我本来可以帮你。）
- *He could have forgotten about* the meeting.
（他可能忘记了会议。）
====

because hopefully
the next time your heart is pounding from stress, +
you're going to remember (v.) this talk +
and you're going to think (v.) to yourself, +
this is my body  +
helping me rise (v.) to this challenge.

[.my2]
因为 但愿下次压力使你心跳加快时, 你会记得今天的演讲. 然后, 你会自我盘算, 这是我的身体在帮助我准备迎接挑战.

And when you view stress in that way, +
your body believes you, +
and your _stress response_ becomes healthier.

Now I said
I have _over a decade  十年，十年期 of demonizing (v.)妖魔化 stress_ to redeem (v.)补救；弥补；掩饰…之不足;挽回影响；改变印象；维护 myself from,

[.my2]
我刚才说过，我有十多年"妖魔化压力"的历史需要弥补。

so we are going to do
one more intervention.

I want to tell you  +
about one of _the most under-appreciated 未受到充分赏识的；未得到正确评价的 aspects_ of the stress response, +
and the idea is this:
Stress makes you social (a.)社交的，交际的.

To understand (v.) this side of stress, +
we need to talk about a hormone 激素，荷尔蒙, oxytocin 催产素；缩宫素,

and I know oxytocin has already gotten
*as much* hype （电视、广播等中言过其实的）促销广告，促销讨论 *as* a hormone can get.

[.my2]
我知道在激素中,
「催产素」掀起许多热潮

It even has its own cute nickname,
the cuddle  搂抱，拥抱 hormone,
because it's released (v.)
when you hug someone. +
But this is a very small part
of what oxytocin is involved in.

[.my2]
甚至有个可爱的小名，叫「拥抱激素」, 因为拥抱时就会产生这种激素. +
但这只是它的一小部分作用

Oxytocin is a neuro 神经-hormone.

It fine-tunes (v.)微调 your brain's _social instincts_ 社会本能,社交本能.

It primes (v.)把（事物）准备好;事先指点；使（某人）做好准备 you to do things
that strengthen _close relationships_.

Oxytocin makes you crave (v.)渴望；热望 _physical contact_ 身体接触
with your friends and family. +
It enhances your empathy (n.)共鸣，同情；感同身受. +
It even makes you more willing
to help (v.) and support
the people you care about.

Some people have even suggested +
we should snort (v.)用鼻子吸（毒品） oxytocin...
to become more compassionate (a.)有同情心的，怜悯的 and caring (a.)关心他人的，体贴的；护理的.

[.my2]
甚至还有人建议,
为了更有同情心和关爱,
我们应吸一点这种激素

But here's what most people
don't understand about oxytocin.
It's a stress hormone.

[.my2]
但大多数人都不知道的是, 它是一种压力激素

Your _pituitary (a.n.)（脑）垂体 gland_ 腺 *pumps* (v.)用泵（或泵样器官等）输送 this stuff *out*  +
as part of the stress response.

It's *as much* 一样；同等 a part of your stress response
*as* the adrenaline 肾上腺素  +
that makes your heart pound.

[.my2]
和肾上腺素一样, 都是压力下让人心跳加速的反应之一 +
(这是你压力反应的一部分，就像肾上腺素让你心跳加速一样。)

And when oxytocin 催产素 is released
in the stress response,
it is motivating you to seek support.

Your biological stress response +
is nudging (v.)（朝某方向）轻推，渐渐推动 you to tell someone how you feel, +
instead of *bottling* it *up* 把（液体）装入瓶中;长时间掩饰，遏制，隐瞒（不快等）;抑制情感.

Your _stress response_ wants
*to make sure* you notice (v.)
when someone else
in your life is struggling +
so that you can support (v.) each other.

[.my2]
"压力反应"会确保你会注意到周遭有人陷入挣扎, 因此我们能相互扶持.

When life is difficult,
your _stress response_ wants you
to be surrounded 围绕；包围
by people who care about you.

[.my2]
当生活陷入困难，压力反应让你希望, 身旁围绕着的都是关心你的人

Okay, so how is *knowing (v.) this side
of stress* going to make you healthier?

[.my2]
好的，那了解压力这方面的事实, 又怎会让我们更健康呢？

Well, oxytocin doesn't only act (v.) on your brain. +
It also acts on your body,
and one of its main roles in your body
is to protect your cardiovascular 心血管的 system
from the effects of stress.

It's a natural anti-inflammatory  抗炎的;抗炎药. +
It also helps your blood vessels
stay (v.) relaxed during stress.

But my favorite effect on the body
is actually on the heart. +
Your heart has receptors 受体；接受器 for this hormone,
and oxytocin helps _heart cells_ regenerate (v.)再生；使再生
and heal (v.)痊愈，康复 from any stress-induced 诱发,感应的 damage.

This _stress hormone_ 应激激素
strengthens (v.) your heart.

And the cool thing is that  +
all of these physical benefits 身体益处 of oxytocin  +
are enhanced by social contact and social support.

So when you *reach out to 表示对某人感兴趣；表示愿意提供援助 others* under stress,
*either* to seek support
*or* to help someone else, +
you release (v.) more of this hormone,
your _stress response_ becomes healthier,
and you actually recover (v.) faster from stress.



I find this amazing 惊人的，了不起的；令人诧异的,
that your _stress response_
has a built-in 内置式 mechanism
for stress resilience 恢复力，复原力,
and that mechanism is _human connection_ 人际关系.

I want to finish by telling you
about one more study. +
And listen up, because this study
could also save a life.

This study tracked about 1,000 adults
in the United States,
and they *ranged*  （在一定范围内）变化；包括（从……到……）之间的各类事物 in age *from* 34 *to* 93,
and they started the study by asking,
"How much stress have you
experienced in the last year?" +

They also asked,
"How much time have you spent
helping out friends, neighbors,
people in your community?"

And then they used _public records_
for the next five years
to find out who died.

Okay, so the bad news first: +
For every major stressful life experience,
like financial difficulties
or family crisis,
that increased _the risk
of dying_ by 30 percent.

[.my2]
任何引起重大压力的生活经验, 像财务困难, 或家庭危机, 会让死亡的风险增加30%

But -- and I hope *you
are expecting (v.)期待；企盼 a "but"* by now -- but that wasn't true for everyone. +
People who spent time *caring for* others
`谓` showed absolutely no stress-related
increase in dying. +
Zero.

[.my2]
那些花时间关心他人的, 他们的致命风险完全不受压力影响



Caring 照顾，照料 created (v.) resilience (n.)恢复力，复原力；（橡胶等的）弹性. +

And so we see once again +
that the harmful effects
of stress on your health +
are not inevitable 必然发生的，不可避免的.

How you think and how you act +
can transform your experience of stress.

When you choose *to view*
your stress response *as* helpful, +
you create the biology of courage.

And when you choose *to connect
with* others under stress, +
you can create (v.) resilience.

Now I wouldn't necessarily  必定，必然；必要地 *ask for* more stressful experiences in my life, +
but this science has given me
a whole new appreciation 理解，领会 for stress.

[.my2]
现在我不一定会要求我的生活中有更多的压力经历，但这门科学让我对压力有了全新的认识。

Stress gives us access to our hearts.

The compassionate 有同情心的，怜悯的 heart +
that finds joy and meaning
in connecting with others, +
and yes, your pounding physical heart,
working so hard to give you
strength and energy.

[.my2]
一颗富有同情心的心，在与他人的联系中找到快乐和意义，是的，你的心跳加速，为的是给你力量和能量。

And when you choose to view
stress in this way,
you're not just getting better at stress,
you're actually making
a pretty profound （影响）深刻的，极大的；（思想）深邃的，（见解）深刻的 statement 说明；表白；表态.

[.my2]
当你选择以这种方式看待压力时，你不仅仅是在更好地应对压力，你实际上是在做一个相当深刻的陈述。

You're saying that you can trust yourself
to handle life's challenges. +
And you're remembering
that you don't have to face them alone.

Thank you.

(Applause)


Chris Anderson: This is kind of 有点,稍微 amazing, what you're telling us. +
It seems amazing to me
that a belief about stress
can make so much difference
to someone's _life expectancy_ 预期寿命. +

How would that extend to advice, +
like, if someone is making
a lifestyle 生活方式 choice
*between*, say, a stressful job
*and* a non-stressful job,
does it matter (v.) which way they go?

[.my2]
但如何将之应用到咨询中呢?
像是，有人要对他的生活方式作选择，
例如，在备受压力的工作, 和舒适安逸的工作之间选择,
选哪个重要吗？

It's equally wise
to go for the stressful job +
*so long as* 只要 you believe
that you can handle it, in some sense?

[.my2]
就某方面而言，只要相信自己能胜任,
选择压力大的工作，是否也不失为明智的选择？


KM: Yeah, and one thing
we know for certain +
is that `主` chasing meaning 意义
些 is better for your health
than trying to avoid discomfort.

[.my2]
是的，而且有一件事是确定的, 也就是，相对于"逃避不安", "追求意义"对健康比较好

And so I would say   +
that's really _the best way to make decisions_,
  is go after 追求、追逐 *#what# it is* 后定 #that# _creates (v.) meaning_ in your life +
and then trust yourself to handle
the stress that follows.

[.my2]
因此我会说，最好的选择方式就是,
选择那些你认为对人生有意义的事,
然后相信自己能应付随之而来的压力

[.my1]
.案例
====
.that's really the best way to make decisions, is go after...

这里, that’s really the best way to make decisions , 是主句. 里面的 's 是系动词.

而这个句子再往后面的  is go after  what it is that... 中的 is, 并不构成一个新的完整句子，而是补充说明前面提到的 "the best way"。这里的 "is" 实际上是对 "the best way" 的进一步解释。 +
即, 整句的意思其实是: "That's the best way to make decisions: (that way) is go after…"

即: 第一个 "is" 属于主句，用于定义“最佳方式”。 +
第二个 "is" 属于补充说明部分，用于解释“最佳方式”到底是什么。

这种结构在口语中很常见，尤其是在演讲中：

- The best thing about this city is, is how friendly the people are.
（关于这个城市最棒的一点是，人们非常友好。） +
*第一个 "is" 引出主句，第二个 "is" 用来补充说明。* +

- What I love most about my job is, is being able to help people.
（我最喜欢我的工作的地方, 是能帮助别人。） +
这里也有两个 "is"，一个用于主句，一个用于补充说明。

不过, 虽然两个 "is" 的使用在口语中是可以接受的，但在书面表达中，可以合并为一个更为简洁的句子：

- What I love most about my job *is* being able to help people.


.is go after (v.) *#what# it is* 后定 #that# creates (v.) meaning in your life

"what"：在这里表示 “……的东西/事情”，引导一个名词性从句。
*"what it is* 后定 that creates (v.) meaning in your life" 的意思是：“什么是能为你的生活带来意义的东西。”

"*what it is* 后定 that creates (v.) meaning" 的含义, 比简单的 "what creates (v.) meaning" 更注重 具体的意义所在。

CA: Thank you so much, Kelly.
It's pretty cool.



(Applause)
