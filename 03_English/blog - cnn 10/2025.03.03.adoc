|稀土元素是什么?
|稀土元素，是元素周期表中第3族之钪、钇和镧系元素**共17种金属化学元素的合称**，皆属于副族元素。 +
"钷"是稀土元素中唯一的放射性元素.

|"稀土元素"该名字的来历
|与其名称暗示的不同，*实际上"稀土元素"在地壳中的丰度并不低*（放射性的"钷 pǒ"除外）. 它之所以称为"稀土元素"的原因是:

- 由于其地球化学特性，*它们在地壳中的分布相当分散，很少有稀土元素富集到容许商业开采的程度.*
- *其彼此之间相似的化学性质, 导致它们倾向于两两或多种一起伴生于矿物中，而难以将稀土元素彼此单独分离，导致开采和提取上的困难*，因此被称为“稀土”元素。

|特征
|- 稀土元素皆为质地较软的银白色金属
- **就其电子特性和磁性质而言，每种稀土元素在我们的科技产业中, 都占据着独一无二的岗位，没有任何其他的元素可以取代。**

[.my2]
从地下获取资金的压力巨大——同样巨大的问题是，特朗普所认为需要"投资"在这里的天文数字, 是否能与这片未知潜力海洋下将来可能获得的"收益", 相匹配。

And who knows what rare earth 稀土 is worth 价值?

What's up, sunshine! I'm Coy Wire. Welcome to CNN 10!

It is Monday, March 3rd—our first episode of the month, Women's History Month. I'm excited to be here, starting this week with you, covering the news so we can stay informed on what's happening around the world in 10 minutes or less.

Let's get started!

Today, we start in Ukraine, where a deal allowing the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earth and critical minerals is on hold after a tense meeting unfolded in the Oval Office at the White House on Friday.

The meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was meant to reset an already strained relationship between the two. There were high hopes that strengthening the alliance between the two countries would mean steps toward strengthening Ukraine's chances of ending their war with Russia.

Instead, this meeting was cut short after a heated conversation, and a deal was left unsigned. The bilateral agreement between the two countries would have been the first of its kind. It was set up to have Ukraine and the United States jointly investing in harnessing Ukraine's critical minerals and other valuable resources, in part to help rebuild the country after three years of Russia's full-scale invasion and war.

What are rare earth and critical minerals?
Our Anna Stewart quickly walks us through what these minerals are and why they're so important.

Rare earths are a group of 17 elements that can be useful for electronics, clean energy technologies, and some weapon systems. But Ukraine doesn’t have globally significant deposits of rare earth minerals.

What Ukraine does have is a lot of other critical minerals. So, what are some of these good for?

Well, the U.S. lists 50 minerals that are critical. This includes titanium and zirconium, which are useful for aviation and the space industry—including for defense. Graphite is a key component for EV batteries and nuclear reactors, and lithium is needed for rechargeable batteries.

Beyond all this being very useful, the U.S. also wants more rare earths and other critical minerals because it's an area China has been dominating for years.

According to the Ukrainian government, Ukraine has deposits of 22 out of 50 minerals deemed critical to the U.S. It's unclear which of these minerals—and how much of them—are actually in this proposed deal. Many of these resources are expensive to mine, and some are currently in Russian-occupied areas.

Extracting, processing, and refining these types of minerals can be very expensive and time-consuming. In Ukraine, the work is further complicated by the ongoing fighting, which makes mining even riskier. The amount of mineral wealth in Ukraine is unclear—resource mapping hasn’t been updated there for decades, with officials and analysts relying on dated Soviet-era mapping.

The idea of leveraging Ukraine's resources was originally part of President Zelenskyy’s victory plan for steps to end the war.

President Trump initially wanted a $500 billion share of Ukraine’s minerals to recoup military and humanitarian aid the U.S. provided in the war effort. It was rejected by his Ukrainian counterpart.

While the new framework for the deal leaves some details to be determined, it would set up a joint reconstruction investment fund with U.S. and Ukrainian ownership. The fund would give the U.S. access to part of Ukraine’s mineral wealth while helping to boost development in the country.

Now, it’s unclear whether the two parties will sign a deal, and much hangs in the balance for Ukrainians still at war with Russia.

CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh visited a titanium mine in Ukraine to show us how the critical mineral is being unearthed there.

"We very much need rare earth. They have great rare earth."

A moonshot for Ukraine’s survival?

Talking peace suddenly means talking about places like this—this lunar landscape, a titanium mine struggling under the Russian bombardment of Ukraine’s power grid, sometimes with only three hours of power a day.

Half a trillion dollars. That was the sum that President Trump initially thought Ukraine might be able to pay back to the United States, in his words.

Here, you get a sense of the challenge, really—because this place, yeah, potential? It's certainly there. But they say they desperately need investment.

These machines are so old. And yes, they say they would welcome American money.

The pressure to get money out of the ground is enormous—as are the questions about whether the astronomical sums Trump thinks are here can match the money to be made under this sprawling sea of unknown potential.

And who knows what rare earth is worth?

You know, but at least it's something.

And who knows what it’s worth?

Who knows if they even have it?

It was, at first, Ukraine’s idea—President Zelenskyy selling their mineral wealth in November, perhaps too successfully, as part of a victory plan for more aid.

Showing reporters maps, they claim:

7% of global production of titanium.
Lithium isn’t mined yet, but they say they have 3% of global reserves.
They say they’re in the top five of graphite reserves and have some actual rare earth metals.
The initial framework deal doesn’t specify what it covers, mentioning only "relevant resource assets" that will be further described in another agreement.

Yet, the White House has been specific about some resources.

There’s a foundry that processes aluminum in Ukraine. It’s been damaged and is not at its current capacity.

If that is restored, it would account for America’s entire imports of aluminum for an entire year.

The U.S.—perhaps a little too eager to take—Ukraine, with no choice but to give in.

A hugely complex deal that may get messier still when it runs into the cold, hard ground truth of where Ukraine is at today.

Today's Story Getting a 10 out of 10!
One super pod of thousands of dolphins!

A pod is the collective noun for a group of dolphins, and a tour boat captain captured this rare video of more than 2,000 of the flippers off the coast of Monterey Bay, California.

The video shows several species of dolphins swimming and breaching as far as the eye can see.

What were they doing?

Marine biologists say the massive pod may have been clustering to fend off predators, hunt for food, or socialize.

It was a party—and they definitely looked like they were having some fun!
