Find the black swan 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情）.

[.my2]
找到黑天鹅。

At 11:30 a.m.

[.my2]
上午11:30。

on June 17th, 1981, a beautiful $70^{\circ}$ spring day with an insistent 不断的；连续的 westerly 西方的；来自西方的 breeze 微风, 37-year-old William Griffin left the second floor bedroom where he lived in his parents' Rochester, New York home and trod (tread的过去式) 走；踩 down the shoe buffed 擦亮的；磨光的 stairs that led to their meticulous 严格认真的；一丝不苟的 living room.

[.my2]
1981年6月17日，一个美丽的 $70^{\circ}$ 春日，吹着持续不断的西风，37岁的威廉·格里芬离开了他在纽约罗彻斯特父母家中居住的二楼卧室，踏下被鞋子擦亮的楼梯，那楼梯通往他们一丝不苟的客厅。

at the bottom.

[.my2]
在楼梯底部。

He stopped, paused, and then without a word of warning shot off three shotgun blasts 霰弹枪的射击（或爆炸声） that killed his mother and a handyman 杂工；能工 who was hanging wallpaper 墙纸 and critically wounded 使受重伤；严重伤害 his stepfather.

[.my2]
他停下，踌躇了一下，接着没说一句警告的话，就开了三枪霰弹枪，杀死了他的母亲和一位正在贴墙纸的杂工，并重伤了他的继父。

The sound reverberated 回响；产生回声 in the enclosed 封闭的；被围住的 space.

[.my2]
声音在封闭的空间里回荡。

Griffin then left the house and shot a workman and two bystanders 旁观者；局外人 as he jogged 慢跑 two blocks to the security trust company, a neighborhood 邻近地区的；附近的 bank.

[.my2]
格里芬随后离开了房子，慢跑了两个街区来到安全信托公司——一家社区银行，途中他开枪打伤了一名工人以及两名旁观者。

Seconds after he entered, people began sprinting 冲刺；快速奔跑 from the bank as Griffin took nine bank employees hostage 人质 and ordered 命令 the customers to leave.

[.my2]
他进去几秒钟后，人们开始从银行里冲出来，因为格里芬劫持了九名银行职员作人质，并命令顾客离开。

For the next three and a half hours, Griffin led police and FBI agents 特工；代理人在 a violent standoff 对峙；僵局 in which he shot and wounded the first two police officers who responded to the bank's silent alarm 警报器；警报 and shot six people who happened to be walking near the bank.

[.my2]
在接下来的三个半小时里，格里芬与警察和联邦调查局特工进行了一场激烈的对峙，期间他开枪打伤了最初对银行无声警报作出反应的两名警官，并射击了六名碰巧在银行附近行走的人。

Griffin shot off so many rounds (子弹)一发；一轮, more than 100 in all, that the police used a garbage truck to shield 保护；遮挡 one officer as he was being rescued 营救；解救.

[.my2]
格里芬打出了如此多发子弹，总共超过 100 发，以至于警方动用了一辆垃圾车来保护一名正在被营救的警官。

Waving 招手示意 the nine bank employees into a small office at 2:30 p.m.

[.my2]
下午 2:30，他招手示意那九名银行职员走进一间小办公室。

Griffin told the manager to call the police and deliver 递送；发表 a message.

[.my2]
格里芬告诉经理打电话给警察，并传达一个信息。

Outside, FBI agent 特工 Clint Vanzant stood by while Rochester police officer Jim O'Brien picked up the phone.

[.my2]
外面，联邦调查局特工克林特·范赞特在一旁待命，罗彻斯特警官吉姆·奥布莱恩接起了电话。

Either you come to the front entrance doors of the bank at 3:00 and have a shootout 枪战 with him in the parking lot, the manager blurted 脱口而出；突然说 through her tears, or he's going to start killing hostages 人质 and throwing out bodies.

[.my2]
“要么你们三点钟来到银行前门，和他在停车场进行枪战，”经理含着泪脱口而出，“要么他就要开始杀人质，并把尸体扔出来。”

Then the line went dead.

[.my2]
随后电话线中断了。

Now, never in the history of the United States had a hostage taker 劫持人质者 killed a hostage 人质 on deadline 最后期限；截止时间.

[.my2]
要知道，在美国历史上，劫持人质者从未在最后期限杀害过人质。

The deadline 最后期限；截止时间 was always a way to focus 集中；聚焦 the mind.

[.my2]
最后期限一直都是一种集中注意力的手段。

What the bad guys really wanted was money, respect, and a helicopter 直升机.

[.my2]
坏人真正想要的是金钱、尊重和一架直升机。

Everyone knew that.

[.my2]
每个人都知道这一点。

It was a permanent 永久的；固定的 and inalterable 不能更改的；不可改变的 known known 已知的事实；已知.

[.my2]
这是一个永久且不可改变的已知事实。

It was the truth.

[.my2]
这是事实。

But that permanent 永久的；固定的 and inalterable 不能更改的；不可改变的 truth was about to change.

[.my2]
但是那个永久且不可改变的事实即将改变。

What came next showed the power of black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情）, those hidden 隐藏的；不为人知的 and unexpected 意想不到的；出乎预料的 pieces of information, those unknown unknowns 未知的未知数 whose unearthing 揭示；发现 has game-changing 改变游戏规则的；产生突破性影响的 effects 效果；影响 on a negotiation dynamic 谈判态势；谈判格局.

[.my2]
接下来发生的事情展示了黑天鹅的力量，这些隐藏的、出乎意料的信息，这些未知的未知数，它们的发现对谈判格局产生了改变游戏规则的影响。

Negotiation breakthroughs 谈判突破 when the game shifts 转变；转移 inalterably 不能更改地；不可改变地 in your favor are created by those who can identify 识别；认出 and utilize 利用；使用 black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情）.

[.my2]
谈判突破是在那些能够识别和利用黑天鹅的人手中产生的，这时局面会不可改变地向你有利的方向转变。

Here's how.

[.my2]
方法如下。

finding leverage 找到优势；取得影响力 in the predictably 可预见地；可预测地 unpredictable 不可预测的；出乎意料的.

[.my2]
在可预见地不可预测中找到优势。

At exactly 3:00 p.m., Griffin gestured 做手势；示意 toward one of his hostages 人质, a 29-year-old teller 银行出纳员 named Margaret Moore, and told her to walk to the glass bank doors.

[.my2]
下午 3:00 整，格里芬示意他的一名人质，一位名叫玛格丽特·摩尔的 29 岁银行出纳员，让她走向玻璃银行门。

Petrified 吓呆的；惊恐失措的, Moore did as she was ordered 命令, but first cried out 大声叫喊；呼喊 that she was a single parent with a young son.

[.my2]
吓呆了的摩尔按他命令做了，但她首先大声喊出她是一个带着年幼儿子的单亲母亲。

Griffin didn't seem to hear her or to care.

[.my2]
格里芬似乎既没听到，也不在乎。

Once the weeping 哭泣的；流泪的 Moore made it to the vestibule (大的建筑物的)前厅；门厅, Griffin shot off two blasts 爆炸（声）；一阵 from his 12-gauge shotgun 12号霰弹枪.

[.my2]
当哭泣着的摩尔走到门厅时，格里芬开了两枪 12 号霰弹枪。

Both of the heavy rounds (子弹)一发；一轮 struck (strike的过去式) 击中；撞击 Moore in the midsection 中段；腰腹部, violently blowing 猛烈地将…炸开；剧烈地吹 and then her through the glass door and almost cutting her body in half 成两半.

[.my2]
两发沉重的子弹都击中了摩尔的腰腹部，猛烈地将她撞穿玻璃门，几乎将她的身体切成两半。

Outside, law enforcement 执法机关；警方 was stunned 惊呆的；目瞪口呆的 into silence.

[.my2]
外面，执法人员被惊得鸦雀无声。

It was obvious 明显的；显而易见的 that Griffin didn't want money or respect or an escape route 逃跑路线.

[.my2]
显而易见，格里芬不想要钱、尊重或逃跑路线。

The only way he was coming out was in a body bag 装尸袋.

[.my2]
他出来的唯一方式就是躺在装尸袋里。

At that moment, Griffin walked over to a full-length 全身的；与人等高的 bank window and pressed 按；压 his body against the glass.

[.my2]
就在那一刻，格里芬走到一扇与人等高的银行窗户前，将身体紧贴在玻璃上。

He was in full view 完全可见；尽收眼底 of a sniper 狙击手 stationed 部署；驻扎 in the church across the street.

[.my2]
他完全暴露在街对面教堂里部署的狙击手的视线中。

Griffin knew quite well the sniper 狙击手 was there.

[.my2]
格里芬很清楚狙击手就在那里。

Earlier in the day, he'd shot at him.

[.my2]
当天早些时候，他还朝他开过枪。

Less than a second after Griffin's silhouette 轮廓；剪影 appeared 出现 in his scope 瞄准镜；范围, the sniper 狙击手 pulled the trigger 扳机.

[.my2]
格里芬的轮廓出现在他的瞄准镜中不到一秒钟，狙击手就扣动了扳机。

Griffin crumpled 倒下；崩溃 to the floor, dead.

[.my2]
格里芬倒在地板上，死了。

Black swan theory 黑天鹅理论 tells us that things happen that were previously thought to be 被认为是；被看作是 impossible 不可能的 or never thought of at all 根本没被想到.

[.my2]
黑天鹅理论告诉我们，有些事情发生了，而这些事以前被认为是不可能的，或者根本没被想到。

This is not the same as saying that sometimes things happen against one-in-a-million odds 百万分之一的几率, but rather that things never imagined 想象 do come to pass 发生；实现.

[.my2]
这和说有些事情是百万分之一的几率发生不一样，而是说从未想象过的事情确实发生了。

The idea of the black swan 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） was popularized 使…流行；使…普及 by risk analyst 风险分析师 Nasim Nicholas Taleb in his best-selling 畅销的 books Fooled by Randomness (2001) and The Black Swan (2007).

[.my2]
黑天鹅这个概念被风险分析师纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布在他畅销书《随机漫步的傻瓜》（2001 年）和《黑天鹅》（2007 年）中普及开来。

But the term goes back 回溯；追溯 much further.

[.my2]
但是这个术语可以追溯到更早。

Until the 17th century, people could only imagine 想象；设想 white swans because all swans ever seen had possessed 拥有；具有 white feathers 羽毛.

[.my2]
直到 17 世纪，人们只能想象白色的天鹅，因为所有见过的天鹅都拥有白色的羽毛。

In 17th century London, it was common 常见的；普通的 to refer to 提及；涉及 impossible 不可能的 things as black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情）.

[.my2]
在 17 世纪的伦敦，将不可能的事情称为黑天鹅是很常见的。

But then the Dutch explorer 探险家 William Deleming went to Western Australia in 1697 and saw a black swan 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情）.

[.my2]
但后来荷兰探险家威廉·德莱明于 1697 年去了西澳大利亚，看到了一只黑天鹅。

Suddenly the unthinkable 不可想象的；难以置信的 and unthought 没被想到的；被忽略的 was real.

[.my2]
突然间，不可想象和没被想到的事情成为了现实。

People had always predicted 预测；预言 that the next swan they saw would be white, but the discovery 发现；发觉 of black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） shattered 粉碎；打破 this worldview 世界观.

[.my2]
人们总是预测他们看到的下一只天鹅会是白色的，但黑天鹅的发现粉碎了这种世界观。

Black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） are just a metaphor 比喻；象征, of course.

[.my2]
当然，黑天鹅只是一个比喻。

Think of Pearl Harbor, the rise of the internet 互联网；英特网, 9/11, and the recent 最近的；近来的 banking crisis 危机；紧要关头.

[.my2]
想想珍珠港事件、互联网的崛起、9/11 事件以及最近的银行业危机。

None of the events above was predicted 预测；预言.

[.my2]
上述事件都没有被预测到。

Yet, on reflection 仔细想想；回想起来, the markers 标记；迹象 were all there.

[.my2]
然而，仔细想想，所有的迹象都在那里。

It's just that people weren't paying attention 注意；关注.

[.my2]
只是人们没有给予关注。

As Taleb uses 使用；运用 the term, the black swan 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） symbolizes 象征；代表 the uselessness 无用；无益 of predictions 预测；预言 based on 基于；以...为基础 previous 先前的；以前的 experience 经验；经历.

[.my2]
正如塔勒布所使用的那样，黑天鹅象征着基于先前经验的预测是徒劳无益的。

Black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） are events or pieces of knowledge 知识；信息 that sit outside 超出；位于...之外 our regular 通常的；常规的 expectations 预期；期望 and therefore cannot be predicted 无法预测.

[.my2]
黑天鹅是超出我们常规预期的事件或信息，因此无法预测。

This is a crucial 关键的；极其重要的 concept 概念；观念 in negotiation 谈判.

[.my2]
这是谈判中一个极其重要的概念。

In every negotiating session 谈判会议；谈判回合, there are different kinds of information.

[.my2]
在每一次谈判回合中，都有不同类型的信息。

There are those things we know like our counterparts 对应的人；谈判对手 name and their offer 提议；出价 and our experiences 经验；经历 from other negotiations 谈判.

[.my2]
有些是我们知道的事情，比如我们的谈判对手的名字和他们的出价，以及我们从其他谈判中获得的经验。

Those are known knowns 已知的事实；已知.

[.my2]
那些是已知事实。

There are those things we are certain 确信的；肯定的 that exist 存在；生存, but we don't know.

[.my2]
有些是我们确信存在，但我们不知道的事情。

Like the possibility 可能性 that the other side might get sick and leave us with another counterpart 对应的人；谈判对手.

[.my2]
比如对方可能会生病，而让我们不得不面对另一个谈判对手的可能性。

Those are known unknowns 已知的未知数；已知但未确定的事, and they are like poker wild cards (扑克牌的)万能牌；王牌.

[.my2]
那些是已知的未知数，它们就像扑克牌里的万能牌。

You know, they're out there 在外面；存在, but you don't know who has them.

[.my2]
你知道它们存在，但你不知道谁拥有它们。

But most important are those things we don't know that we don't know.

[.my2]
但最重要的是那些我们不知道自己不知道的事情。

Pieces of information we've never imagined 想象；设想, but that would be game-changing 改变游戏规则的；产生突破性影响的 if uncovered 发现；揭露.

[.my2]
我们从未想象过的信息，但如果被发现，将会是改变游戏规则的。

Maybe our counterpart 对应的人；谈判对手 wants the deal 交易；协议 to fail 失败；没有成功 because he's leaving for a competitor 竞争者；竞争对手.

[.my2]
也许我们的谈判对手希望交易失败，因为他正要跳槽去一家竞争对手。

These unknown unknowns 未知的未知数 are black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情）.

[.my2]
这些未知的未知数就是黑天鹅。

With their known knowns 已知的事实；已知 and prior 先前的；在前的 expectations 预期；期望 so firmly 坚定地；牢固地 guiding 指导；引导 their approach 方式；方法, Vanzant and really the entire 整个的；全部的 FBI were blind 盲目的；看不见的 to the clues 线索；迹象 and connections 联系；关联 that showed there was something outside of 在...之外 the predictable 可预见的事物；可预测的 at play 在起作用；在进行.

[.my2]
由于他们的已知事实和先前的预期如此坚定地指导着他们的方式，范赞特以及整个联邦调查局都对那些表明有超出可预见的因素在起作用的线索和关联视而不见。

They couldn't see the black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） in front of them.

[.my2]
他们看不到眼前的黑天鹅。

I don't mean to single out 挑选出；突出强调 Vanzant here.

[.my2]
我在这里并不是想突出强调范赞特一个人。

He did all of law enforcement 执法机关；警方 a service 贡献；服务 by highlighting 强调；使显著 this event and he told me and a room full of agents 坐满特工的屋子 the story of that horrible 可怕的；糟糕的 June day during a training session 培训课程；训练课 at Quantico 昆蒂科（美国联邦调查局总部所在地）.

[.my2]
他通过强调这一事件，为所有执法人员做出了贡献，并在昆蒂科的一次培训课程中向我和一屋子的特工讲述了那个可怕六月天的故事。

It was an introduction 介绍；引见 to the suicide by cop phenomenon 借警察之手自杀现象 when an individual 个人；个体 deliberately 故意地；蓄意地 creates 创造；引起 a crisis situation 危机局面 to provoke 激起；引起 a lethal 致命的；可致死的 response 反应；回应 from law enforcement 执法机关；警方.

[.my2]
这是对借警察之手自杀现象的介绍，即个体故意制造危机局面，以激起执法人员致命的反应。

But there was an even greater lesson 教训；经验 at stake 有风险；处于危险中.

[.my2]
但有一个更重要的教训值得关注。

The point 要点；目的 of the story then and now was how important it is to recognize 认识到；承认 the unexpected 意想不到的；出乎预料的, to make sure things like Moore's death never happen again.

[.my2]
当时和现在，这个故事的重点都是认识到意想不到的事情有多么重要，以确保像摩尔之死这样的事情永远不再发生。

On that day in June 1981, O'Brien kept calling 不停地打电话 the bank, but each time the bank employee who answered quickly hung up 快速地挂断电话.

[.my2]
在 1981 年的那个六月，奥布莱恩不停地给银行打电话，但每次接电话的银行职员都快速地挂断电话。

It was at that moment they should have realized 意识到；认识到 the situation was outside the known 超出已知范围.

[.my2]
正是在那一刻，他们应该意识到情况超出了已知范围。

Hostage takers 劫持人质者 always talked because they always had demands 要求；需求.

[.my2]
劫持人质者总是会说话，因为他们总是有要求。

They always wanted to be heard, respected, and paid.

[.my2]
他们总是希望被听到、被尊重和得到报酬。

But this guy didn't.

[.my2]
但这个人没有。

Then midway through 在...中途；在...当中 the standoff 对峙；僵局, a police officer entered the command post 指挥所 with the news that a double homicide 双重谋杀案 with a third person critically wounded 使受重伤；严重伤害 had been reported 报告；汇报 a few blocks away.

[.my2]
接着，在对峙的中途，一名警官进入指挥所，报告了一个消息：几个街区外发生了一起双重谋杀案，还有第三人受重伤。

"Do we need to know this?" Vanzan said.

[.my2]
“我们需要知道这个吗？”范赞特说。

"Is there a connection 联系；关联?" No one knew or found out in time.

[.my2]
“两者之间有联系吗？”没有人知道，也没有人及时查明。

If they had, they might have uncovered 发现；揭露 a second black swan 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） that Griffin had already killed several people without making monetary demands 金钱要求；钱财要求.

[.my2]
如果他们查明了，他们可能已经发现了第二只黑天鹅：格里芬在没有提出任何金钱要求的情况下，已经杀了好几个人。

And then a few hours in 在...之中；在...之后, the hostage taker 劫持人质者 had one of the hostages 人质 read a note 便条；纸条 to the police over the phone 通过电话.

[.my2]
接着，几个小时后，劫持人质者让其中一个人质通过电话给警察读了一张便条。

Curiously 奇怪地；好奇地, there were no demands 要求；需求.

[.my2]
奇怪的是，里面没有要求。

Instead, it was a rambling 冗长而杂乱的；不着边际的 diatribe 抨击；指责 about Griffin's life and the wrongs 冤屈；不公正待遇 he'd endured 忍受；承受.

[.my2]
相反，这是一篇冗长而杂乱的抨击，内容是关于格里芬的生活以及他所忍受的冤屈。

The note 便条；纸条 was so long and unfocused 不集中的；不明确的, it was never read in its entirety 整体；全部.

[.my2]
这张便条太长且不明确，从未被完整地阅读。

Because of this, one important line, another black swan 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情）, wasn't registered 被记录；被注意到.

[.my2]
正因为如此，其中一句重要的话——另一只黑天鹅——没有被注意到。

"After the police take my life 夺走我的生命..." because these black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） weren't uncovered 发现；揭露, Vanzant and his colleagues 同事；同僚 never saw the situation for what it was.

[.my2]
“在警察夺走我的生命之后......”因为这些黑天鹅没有被发现，范赞特和他的同事从未看清局势的本质。

Griffin wanted to die 死去；死亡, and he wanted the police to do it for him 为他做这件事.

[.my2]
格里芬想死，他想让警察为他做这件事（即，杀死他）。

Nothing like this.

[.my2]
没有发生过类似的事情。

a shootout 枪战 on a deadline 在最后期限 before had ever happened to the FBI.

[.my2]
在最后期限进行枪战这种事，联邦调查局以前从未遇到过。

So, they tried to fit 使...适合；适应 the information into what had happened in the past into the old templates 模板；模式.

[.my2]
所以，他们试图将这些信息套入过去发生的事情，套入旧的模式中。

They wondered, "What does he actually want?" After scaring 恐吓；使害怕 them for a bit, they expected 期望；期待 Griffin to pick up the phone and start a dialogue 对话；交流.

[.my2]
他们心想：“他到底想要什么？”他们预计格里芬在恐吓他们一阵子后，会拿起电话开始对话。

No one gets killed on deadline 在最后期限.

[.my2]
没有人会在最后期限被杀。

Or so they thought.

[.my2]
或者说，他们是这么认为的。

Uncovering unknown unknowns 发现未知的未知数.

[.my2]
发现未知的未知数。

The lesson 教训；经验 of what happened at 3:00 p.m.

[.my2]
发生在下午 3:00 的事件教训是：

on June 17th, 1981 in Rochester, New York, was that when bits and pieces of a case don't add up 有道理；说得通, it's usually because our frames of reference 参照系；参考框架 are off 错误的；不正常的.

[.my2]
1981 年 6 月 17 日在纽约罗彻斯特发生的事件教训是，当一个案件的零零碎碎的信息说不通时，通常是因为我们的参照系出了问题。

They will never add up 有道理；说得通 unless we break free of 摆脱；挣脱 our expectations 预期；期望.

[.my2]
除非我们摆脱预期，否则它们永远不会说得通。

Every case is new.

[.my2]
每个案件都是新的。

We must let what we know, our known knowns 已知的事实；已知, guide 指导；引导 us, but not blind 使...盲目；蒙蔽 us to what we do not know.

[.my2]
我们必须让我们所知道的，即我们的已知事实，来指导我们，但不能蒙蔽我们，使我们看不到自己不知道的东西。

We must remain 保持；仍然是 flexible 灵活的；可变通的 and adaptable 适应性强的；能适应的 to any situation.

[.my2]
我们必须保持灵活和适应性强以应对任何情况。

We must always retain 保持；保留 a beginner's mind 初学者的心态；空杯心态.

[.my2]
我们必须始终保持一颗初学者的心态。

And we must never overvalue 过高评价；过分重视 our experience 经验；经历 or undervalue 低估；不重视 the formational 形成的；构成的 and emotional realities 情感的现实状况 served up 呈现；提供 moment by moment 时时刻刻；随时 in whatever situation we face.

[.my2]
而且我们绝不能过高评价我们的经验，或低估我们所面临的任何情况中时时刻刻呈现出的形成性和情感的现实状况。

But those were not the only important lessons 教训；经验 of that tragic 悲惨的；不幸的 event.

[.my2]
但那些并非是那次悲惨事件中唯一重要的教训。

If an over-reliance 过分依赖；过度依赖 on known knowns 已知的事实；已知 can shackle 束缚；限制 a negotiator 谈判者 to assumptions 假设；臆断 that prevent 阻止；防止 him from seeing and hearing all that a situation presents 呈现；展现, then perhaps an enhanced 提高的；增强的 receptivity 接受能力；感受性 to the unknown unknowns 未知的未知数 can free 使...自由；解放 that same negotiator 谈判者 to see and hear the things that can produce 产生；带来 dramatic breakthroughs 巨大的突破.

[.my2]
如果过度依赖已知事实可以束缚一位谈判者，让他受制于假设，阻止他看到和听到一个局面呈现出的所有信息，那么也许增强对未知的未知数的接受能力可以解放这位谈判者，让他看到和听到那些可以带来巨大突破的事物。

From the moment I heard the tale 故事；传说 of June 17th, 1981, I realized 意识到；认识到 that I had to completely 完全地；彻底地 change 改变 how I approached 方式；方法；处理 negotiating 谈判.

[.my2]
从我听到 1981 年 6 月 17 日故事的那一刻起，我就意识到我必须彻底改变我处理谈判的方式。

I began to hypothesize 假设；假定 that in every negotiation 谈判, each side is in possession 拥有；持有 of at least 至少 three black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情）.

[.my2]
我开始假设，在每一次谈判中，每一方至少都拥有三只黑天鹅。

Three pieces of information that were worthy 值得的；有价值的 to be discovered 发现；揭露 by the other side would change everything 改变一切.

[.my2]
如果被对方发现，这三条有价值的信息将改变一切。

My experience 经验；经历 since has proven 证明；证实 this to be true.

[.my2]
此后我的经验已经证明了这一点是真实的。

Now, I should note 注意；指出 here that this is not just a small tweak 微调；小改动 to negotiation technique 谈判技巧.

[.my2]
现在，我应该指出，这不仅仅是对谈判技巧的一个小小的微调。

It is not coincidence 巧合；偶然 that I embraced 接受；拥抱 black swan 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） as the name of my company and the symbol 象征；标志 of our approach 方式；方法.

[.my2]
我接受“黑天鹅”作为我公司的名称以及我们方式的象征，绝非巧合。

Finding and acting on 根据；依照 black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） mandates 命令；要求 a shift 转变；转移 in your mindset 思维模式；心态.

[.my2]
发现并根据黑天鹅采取行动要求你的思维模式发生转变。

It takes negotiation 谈判 from being a one-dimensional 一维的；平面的 move 行动；步骤 countermove 反击；对应行动 game of checkers 跳棋 to a three-dimensional 三维的；立体的 game that's more emotional 情绪化的；感性的, adaptive 适应性强的, intuitive 直觉的；凭直觉的, and truly effective 有效的；起作用的.

[.my2]
它将谈判从一个一维的行动—反击的跳棋游戏，提升到一个更情绪化、适应性强、直觉的，且真正有效的三维游戏。

Finding black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） is no easy task 轻松的任务.

[.my2]
发现黑天鹅绝非易事。

Of course, we are all to some degree 在某种程度上 blind 盲目的；看不见的.

[.my2]
当然，在某种程度上我们都是盲目的。

We do not know what is around the corner 即将发生的；在拐角处 until we turn 转过 it.

[.my2]
我们不知道即将发生什么，直到我们转过那个弯。

By definition 定义；本质, we do not know what we don't know.

[.my2]
从定义上讲，我们不知道我们不知道的事情。

That's why I say that finding and understanding 理解；明白 black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） requires 需要；要求 a change of mindset 思维模式的改变；心态的转变.

[.my2]
这就是为什么我说发现和理解黑天鹅需要思维模式的改变。

You have to open up 打开；开辟 your established 既定的；已确立的 pathways 路径；途径 and embrace 接受；拥抱 more intuitive 直觉的；凭直觉的 and nuanced 细微差别的；微妙的 ways 方式；方法 of listening 倾听；听.

[.my2]
你必须开辟你既定的路径，并接受更直觉的和微妙的倾听方式。

This is vital 至关重要的；极其重要的 to people of all walks of life 各行各业的人；社会各界, from negotiators 谈判者 to inventors 发明家 and marketers 市场营销人员.

[.my2]
这对各行各业的人都至关重要，从谈判者到发明家和市场营销人员。

What you don't know can kill 扼杀；毁灭 you or your deal 交易；协议.

[.my2]

At a taxonomic level 分类学层面, there are three kinds 种类；类型, positive 积极的；正面的, negative 消极的；负面的, and normative 规范的；标准的.

[.my2]
在分类学层面，有三种类型：积极的、消极的和规范的。

这里有一个例子。

在你把你的生意放到市场上（出售）三个月后，一位潜在买家终于告诉你：“是的，我想买下它。”你很兴奋，但几天后，当他提交了一个如此之低的出价以至于侮辱人时，你的喜悦变成了失望。

This is the only offer 提议；出价 you have.

[.my2]
这是你唯一的出价。

So, what do you do?

但是，即使你没有其他出价，或者这个有兴趣的买家是你的首选，你仍然拥有比你的谈判对手透露他的渴望之前更多的权力。

You control 控制；支配 what they want.

[.my2]
你控制着他们想要的东西。

That's why experienced negotiators 有经验的谈判者 delay 推迟；延迟 making offers 提出出价；报价.

[.my2]
这就是为什么有经验的谈判者会推迟报价。

They don't want to give up 放弃；让出 leverage 杠杆；影响力.

[.my2]
他们不想放弃影响力。

Positive leverage 积极影响力 should improve 改善；提高 your psychology 心理状态；心理学 during negotiation 谈判.

正如有效的谈判者早就知道，心理学家也一再证明，潜在的损失在人类思维中显得比相似的收益更突出。

Getting a good deal 获得好交易；达成好协议 may push 推；促使 us toward 朝向；倾向于 making a risky bet 冒险一搏；进行危险的赌博, but saving 拯救；挽救 our reputation 名誉；声誉 from destruction 破坏；毁灭 is a much stronger 强得多；更强大 motivation 动机；动力.

Effective negotiators 有效的谈判者 look for 寻找；寻求 pieces of information, often obliquely 间接地；不直接地 revealed 透露；揭示, that show what is important 重要的；有价值的 to their counterpart 对应的人；谈判对手.

Who is their audience 听众；受众? What signifies 表示；意味 status 地位；身份 and reputation 名誉；声誉 to them? What most worries 最担心；最忧虑 them?

[.my2]
一个更微妙的方法是定性你的消极影响力，从而明确表示出来，而不用攻击性的话语，例如“你似乎非常重视你总是按时付款这一事实”或“你似乎不在乎你使我处于何种境地”这样的句子，能真正开启谈判进程。

Here are a few ways 这里有一些方法；以下是几种途径 to unearth 挖掘出；发现 these powerful black swans 这些有力的黑天鹅；这些重要的意料之外的事.

[.my2]
以下是几种途径来挖掘出这些有力的黑天鹅。

Get facetime 获得面对面交流；进行当面接触.

[.my2]
进行当面接触。

Black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） are incredibly hard to uncover 极难发现；难以揭示 if 如果 you're not literally at the table 你没有真正坐在谈判桌前；你没有亲自参与.

[.my2]
黑天鹅极难发现，如果你没有真正坐在谈判桌前。

No matter how much 无论多少；不管多少 research 研究；调查 you do 做；进行, there's just some information 就是有些信息；就是一些资料 that you are not going to find out 不会发现；不会查明 unless 除非 you sit face to face 你面对面坐着；你当面交流.

[.my2]
不管你进行多少研究，就是有些信息你不会查明，除非你当面交流。

Today 今天；现今, a lot of 许多；大量 younger people 年轻人 do almost everything over email 几乎所有事都通过电子邮件处理；几乎只用电邮交流.

[.my2]
现今，许多年轻人几乎所有事都通过电子邮件处理。

It's just how things are done 这只是事情的惯常做法；这是常态.

[.my2]
但通过电子邮件很难找到黑天鹅，因为一个很简单的理由：即使你用厉害的称呼和精心设计的问题让你的谈判对手方寸大乱，电子邮件给他们太多的时间思考和恢复平静，以避免透露太多。

In addition 此外；而且, email doesn't allow for 电子邮件不允许；电邮不具备 tone of voice effects 语气效果；声音语调的影响 and it doesn't let you read 不让你解读；不能使你读懂 the nonverbal parts 非言语部分；非语言信息 of 的 your counterpart's response 你的谈判对手的反应；对方的回应.

[.my2]

[.my2]
所以，我告诉我的客户把他的联系人带出可口可乐大楼。

"You got to get him to dinner 你们得让他出来吃晚饭."

[.my2]
“你们得让他出来吃晚饭。”

"You're going to say 你将要说；你会说, 'Would it be a bad idea for me to take you to your favorite steakhouse 我带你去你最喜欢的牛排馆是个坏主意吗；我请你去你最爱吃的牛排餐厅好吗 and we just have a few laughs 我们只是聊聊天笑一笑 and we don't talk business 我们不谈生意?'"

So, my client 我的客户 got this guy out for dinner 请这个人出来吃晚餐, and as promised 像承诺的那样；正如约定, he didn't bring up business 没有提起生意；没谈业务.

[.my2]
所以，我的客户请这个人出来吃晚餐，正如约定，他没有提起生意。

But there was no way not to talk about it 没办法不谈论它；不可能不提起这事.

[.my2]
但是不可能不提起这事。

[.my2]
正是由于我的客户建立了私人当面接触，联系人承认他承认他的部门一团糟，他将不得不把事情交给别人来完成交易。

And he did 确实做到了；他照做了.

[.my2]
他照做了。

It took more than a year to get the deal signed 花了一年多时间才把合同签下来, but they did it 成功了；做到了.

[.my2]
花了一年多时间才把合同签下来，但他们成功了。

Observe unguarded moments 观察不设防的时刻；留意放松的时机.

[.my2]

虽然你必须进行当面接触，但正式的商务会议、有组织的会面和计划好的谈判会议往往是最不透露信息的当面接触类型，因为这些是人们最设防的时刻。

Hunting for 寻找；探寻 black swans 黑天鹅（比喻不可能存在或极不可能发生的事情） is also effective 也有效；也有用 during 在...期间 unguarded moments 不设防的时刻；放松的时机 at the fringes 在边缘；在非正式场合.

[.my2]
无论是在像我的客户和他的可口可乐联系人一起用餐一样的饭局，还是在正式接触之前或之后短暂放松的时刻。

[.my2]
在一个典型的商务会议期间，在你真正开始谈生意之前开始的几分钟，和当大家散场时最后的几分钟往往告诉你更多关于对手的信息，而不是中间的任何内容。

That's why reporters 记者；新闻工作者 have a credo 信条；信念 to never turn off 永不关掉；从不关闭 their recorders 他们的录音机；他们的录音设备.

当这家公司的一位负责人要求他调查一处位于南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿核心地带的多功能房产的时候，我的学生一直在对潜在目标进行尽职调查。

What sort of cap rate can be expected 什么样的资本化率可以预期；可以期待什么样的收益率 in this type of building 在这种类型的建筑中?" Through 通过；经过 the ensuing back and forth 随后的来回交流；接下来的反复讨论, my student 我的学生 learned 得知；了解到 that owners 业主；所有者 could expect 可以预期；可以期待 rates 比率；收益率 of 6 to 7% 6%到7% because 因为 buildings like this 像这样的建筑；这类楼房 were popular with 受...欢迎；流行于 students at the local university 当地大学的学生；该大学的学生, a growing school 一所不断发展的学校；一所规模扩大的大学 where 在那里 60% of the student body lived off campus 60%的学生住在校外.

[.my2]
通过接下来的反复讨论，我的学生了解到业主可以预期 6% 到 7%的收益率，因为像这样的建筑受当地大学的学生欢迎，这是一所不断发展的学校，在那里 60% 的学生住在校外。

He also 也；还 learned 得知；了解到 that it would be prohibitively expensive 极其昂贵的；贵得令人望而却步, if not physically impossible 即使不是物理上不可能；如果不是实际上办不到, to buy land nearby 在附近购买土地 and build a similar building 建造一个类似的建筑.

"Fortunately and unfortunately 幸运地和不幸地；说好也不好, yes 是的," the broker said 经纪人说；中介表示, "The occupancy has historically been 100% 入住率历来是100%；历史上入住率一直是100% and it is a cash cow 摇钱树；非常赚钱的生意, but the students act like college students 学生们的行为就像大学生一样；学生们比较闹腾." A light bulb went on in my students head 我的学生脑中灵光一闪；我的学生突然明白了什么.

[.my2]
“说好也不好，是的，”经纪人说，“历史上入住率一直是 100%，它是一个摇钱树，但学生们的行为就像大学生一样。”我的学生脑中灵光一闪。

There was something strange afoot 有些奇怪的事情正在发生；有蹊跷.

[.my2]
有蹊跷。

If it were such a cash cow 如果它是这样一个摇钱树；如果它如此赚钱, why would someone sell 为什么会有人出售；为什么会有人卖掉 a 100% occupied building 一栋 100% 入住的建筑 located next to 位于...旁边；紧邻 a growing campus 一个不断扩大的校区；一个规模扩大的校园 in an affluent city 在一个富裕的城市；在一个繁荣的都市? that was irrational by any measure 无论如何都是不理智的；无论以何种标准衡量都不合理.

[.my2]
如果它是这样一个摇钱树，为什么会有人出售一栋 100% 入住的建筑，紧邻一个不断扩大的校区，位于一个富裕的城市？这无论如何都是不理智的。

A little befuddled 有点困惑的；稍微糊涂的, but still in the negotiation mindset 仍然保持谈判心态；依然处于协商状态, my student 我的学生 constructed a label 构建了一个称谓；形成了一个标签.

[.my2]
稍微糊涂的，但依然处于协商状态，我的学生构建了一个称谓。

[.my2]
“如果他或她正在出售这样一个摇钱树，看起来卖家一定对未来市场基本面有疑虑，”他说。

"Well 嗯；这个, he said 说；表示 the seller has some tougher properties 卖家有一些更难处理的房产；卖方有一些更棘手的物业 in Atlanta and Savannah 在亚特兰大和萨凡纳, so he has to get out of this property 必须摆脱这处房产；不得不卖掉这个物业 to pay back 来偿还；为了还清 the other mortgages 其他抵押贷款；别的按揭."

[.my2]
“嗯，他表示卖家在亚特兰大和萨凡纳有一些更棘手的物业，所以他不得不卖掉这个物业来偿还其他抵押贷款。”

Bingo 猜中了；说对了 (表示猜中或成功).

[.my2]
说对了。

With that, my student had unearthed 发掘；发现 a fantastic black swan 黑天鹅事件；意想不到的事件。

[.my2]
就这样，我的学生发现了一个绝妙的黑天鹅事件。

The seller was suffering constraints 受到限制；面临约束 that until that moment had been unknown。

[.my2]
卖方正面临着直到那一刻都不知道的约束。

My student put the broker on mute 将经纪人静音；让中介闭嘴 as he described other properties 房产；财产 and used the moment to discuss pricing with his boss 老板；上司。

[.my2]
当经纪人描述其他房产时，我的学生将他静音，并利用这个时刻与他的老板讨论定价。

He quickly gave him the green light 开绿灯；批准 to make a lowball offer 恶意低价；极低的报价, an extreme anchor 极端锚点；极端的起始价, to try to yank the broker 猛拉；强行使 to his minimum 最低限度；底线。

[.my2]
他很快给了他开绿灯来提出一个恶意低价，一个极端锚点，试图强行使经纪人达到他的底线。

After quizzing 盘问；质问 the broker if the seller would be willing to close quickly 快速成交；迅速完成 and getting a yes, my student set his anchor 设定他的锚点；提出他的起始价。

[.my2]
在盘问经纪人卖方是否愿意快速成交并得到肯定的回答后，我的学生设定了他的锚点。

I think I have heard enough, he said.

[.my2]
“我想我听得够多了，”他说。

We are willing to offer $3.4$ million.

[.my2]
“我们愿意出价 $340$ 万美元。”

Okay, the broker answered.

[.my2]
“好的，”经纪人回答道。

that is well below 远低于；远远不及 the asking price 要价；开价。

[.my2]
“那远远低于要价。

However, I can bring the offer to the seller and see what he thinks.

[.my2]
然而，我可以将这个报价带给卖方，看看他怎么想。”

Later that day, the broker came back with a counter offer 还价；反报价。

[.my2]
那天晚些时候，经纪人带着还价回来了。

The seller had told him that the number was too low, but he was willing to take $3.7$ million。

[.my2]
卖方告诉他这个数字太低了，但他愿意接受 $370$ 万美元。

My student could barely keep from 几乎不能避免；差点没有 keep from falling off his chair 从椅子上摔下来；感到震惊。

[.my2]
我的学生差点没有从椅子上摔下来（感到震惊）。

The counter offer was lower than his goal。

[.my2]
还价低于他的目标。

But rather than jump at the amount 迫不及待地接受金额；急于接受价格 and risk leaving value on the table 冒着将价值留在桌上；冒着错失价值 with a wimp-win deal 懦夫胜利的交易；软弱的胜利, my student pushed further 进一步推进；继续施压。

[.my2]
但他没有急于接受这个金额，冒着错失价值的风险达成一个软弱的胜利交易，我的学生进一步推进。

He said no without using the word。

[.my2]
他在没有使用“不”这个词的情况下说了不。

That is closer to what we believe the value to be, he said.

[.my2]
“那更接近我们认为的价值，”他说。

But we cannot in good conscience 凭良心；问心无愧地 pay more than $3.55$ million.

[.my2]
“但我们问心无愧地不能支付超过 $355$ 万美元。”

Later, my student told me and I agreed that he should have used a label 贴标签；称呼 or calibrated question 精确设计的问题；校准过的问题 here to push the broker to bid against himself 与自己竞价；自相残杀。

[.my2]
后来，我的学生告诉我，我同意他应该在这里使用一个标签或一个经过校准的问题来推动经纪人自相残杀。

But he was so surprised by how far the price had dropped that he stumbled into 偶然陷入；不知不觉地进入 old school haggling 老式议价；传统讨价还价。

[.my2]
但他对价格下降了这么多感到非常惊讶，以至于他偶然陷入了老式的讨价还价。

"I am only authorized 授权；批准 to go down to $3.6$ million," the broker answered, clearly showing that he'd never taken a negotiation class that taught the acriman model and how to pivot to terms 转向条款；关注合同细节 to avoid the haggle。

[.my2]
“我只被授权降到 $360$ 万美元，”经纪人回答道，清楚地表明他从未上过教阿克曼模型和如何转向条款以避免讨价还价的谈判课。

My student's boss signaled to him 打信号；示意 that $3.6$ million worked, and he agreed to the price。

[.my2]
我的学生的老板向他示意 $360$ 万美元可以接受，他同意了这个价格。

I've teased 戏弄；暗示 several of the techniques 技巧；方法 my student used to effectively negotiate a great deal for his firm 公司；事务所。

[.my2]
我已经暗示了我的学生用来为他的公司有效地协商一个很棒的交易的几个技巧。

From the use of labels and calibrated questions to the probing 探查；探索 of constraints to unearth 发现；揭示 a beautiful black swan。

[.my2]
从使用标签和经过校准的问题到探查约束以揭示一个美丽的黑天鹅事件。

It also bears noting 值得注意；值得一提 that my student did tons of work beforehand 事先；预先 and had prepared labels and questions so that he was ready to jump on 利用；抓住 the black swan when the broker offered it.

My students at Georgetown and USC have constantly proved that these ideas work everywhere。

[.my2]
我在乔治城大学和南加州大学的学生不断证明这些想法在任何地方都奏效。

More than one student has stopped breathing 停止呼吸；屏住呼吸 when I looked at them and said, "I need a car in $60$ seconds or she dies." Thanks for coming along for the ride 感谢一路同行；感谢你们的参与。

[.my2]
不止一个学生在我看着他们说“我需要 60 秒内的一辆车，否则她就死了”时屏住了呼吸。感谢你们的参与。

Georgetown and USC have both been phenomenal 现象级的；非凡的 places to teach.

[.my2]

I am grateful to still be in touch with 保持联系；保持接触 some of you today.

我很感激今天仍与你们中的一些人保持联系。

What wisdom 智慧；明智 there is in the universe that decided your paths 道路；命运 were necessary 必需的；必要的。

[.my2]
决定你们的命运是必要的宇宙中有着怎样的智慧啊。

I don't understand.

[.my2]
我不明白。

I was blessed by your grace 蒙你恩典；得你庇佑。

[.my2]
我蒙你恩典。

I need all the help I can get 得到所有能得到的帮助；尽我所能寻求帮助。

[.my2]
我需要尽我所能寻求帮助。

Along the same lines 与此类似；同样，we want to produce a negotiation one sheet 谈判单页纸；一张纸的谈判总结 that summarizes 总结；概括 the tools we are going to use.

[.my2]
与此类似，我们想制作一份谈判单页纸来总结我们将要使用的工具。

It will have five short sections 部分；章节。

[.my2]
它将有五个简短的部分。

Section one, the goal.

[.my2]
第一部分，目标。

Think through 仔细思考；想清楚 best-worst case scenarios 最好和最坏的情况；最佳和最差的情境, but only write down a specific goal 特定目标；明确目标 that represents 代表；体现 the best case 最佳情况；最好结果。

[.my2]
仔细思考最好和最坏的情况，但只写下一个代表最佳情况的特定目标。

Typically 典型地；通常, negotiation experts 谈判专家；协商高手 will tell you to prepare by making a list.

[.my2]
通常，谈判专家会告诉你通过列出一个清单来准备。

Your bottom line 底线；最低要求, what you really want, how you're going to try to get there, and counters to your counterparts arguments 反驳你的对手的论点；反击对方的说辞。

[.my2]
你的底线、你真正想要的、你将如何尝试达到目标，以及反驳你的对手论点的说辞。

But this typical preparation fails in many ways 在许多方面失败；有很多不足之处。

[.my2]
但这种典型的准备在许多方面都有不足之处。

It's unimaginative 缺乏想象力；没有新意 and leads to 导致；造成 the predictable bargaining dynamic 可预测的议价动态；意料之中的谈判格局 of offer counter offer meet in the middle 中间相遇；折中。

[.my2]
它缺乏想象力，并导致了报价、还价、中间相遇的可预测的议价动态。

In other words 换句话说；也就是说, it gets results, but they're often mediocre 平庸的；一般的。

[.my2]
换句话说，它会得到结果，但它们通常是平庸的。

The centerpiece 核心；中心环节 of the traditional preparation dynamic 传统准备动态；传统准备模式 and its greatest Achilles heel 最大的致命弱点；主要弊端 is something called the BATNA 最佳替代方案（Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement）。

[.my2]
传统准备模式的核心和它最大的致命弱点是一种叫做 BATNA 的东西。

Roger Fischer and William Yuri coined the term 创造术语；发明术语 in their $1981$ bestseller 畅销书；最畅销的书, Getting to Yes.

[.my2]
罗杰·菲舍尔和威廉·尤里在他们 $1981$ 年的畅销书《getting to yes》中创造了这个术语。

And it stands for 代表；意指 best alternative to a negotiated agreement 谈判协议的最佳替代方案。

[.my2]
它代表谈判协议的最佳替代方案。

Basically 基本上；大体上, it's the best possible option you have if negotiations fail, your last resort 最后的手段；最后的选择。

[.my2]
基本上，如果谈判失败，这是你拥有的最好的可能选择，你的最后的选择。

Say you're on a car lot 汽车经销店；停车场 trying to sell your old BMW $3$ Series.

[.my2]
比方说你在一个汽车经销店试图出售你的旧宝马 3 系。

If you already have another dealer 经销商；代理商 who's given you a written offer 书面报价；书面提议 for $10,000$, that's your BATNA.

[.my2]
如果你已经有另一个给了你 $10,000$ 美元的书面报价的经销商，那就是你的 BATNA。

The problem is that BATNA tricks 欺骗；诱骗 negotiators into aiming low 目标定低；期望不高。

[.my2]
问题是 BATNA 诱骗谈判者将目标定低。

Researchers have found that humans have a limited capacity 有限的能力；有限的容量 for keeping focus 保持专注；集中注意力 in complex stressful situations 复杂有压力的情况；紧张的局面 like negotiations.

[.my2]
研究人员发现人类在像谈判这样的复杂有压力的情况下，保持专注的能力是有限的。

And so once a negotiation is underway 正在进行；已开始, we tend to gravitate toward 倾向于；受…吸引 the focus point 焦点；中心点 that has the most psychological significance 心理意义；精神重要性 for us.

[.my2]
因此一旦谈判正在进行，我们倾向于被对我们来说具有最大心理意义的焦点所吸引。

In that context 在那种情况下；在那个背景下, obsessing over 对…痴迷；对…过分关注 a BATNA turns it into your target and thereby 从而；因此 sets the upper limit 上限；最高限度 of what you will ask for。

[.my2]
在那种情况下，对 BATNA 痴迷会将它变成你的目标，从而设定了你将要求的上限。

After you've spent hours on a BATNA, you mentally concede 精神上让步；心理上屈服 everything beyond 超过；超出 it.

[.my2]
在你花了数小时在 BATNA 上之后，你在精神上对超出它的一切都让步。

God knows 上帝知道；天晓得 aiming low is seductive 诱人的；有吸引力的。

[.my2]
天晓得把目标定低是多么诱人。

Self-esteem 自尊；自尊心 is a huge factor 巨大因素；重要因素 in negotiation, and many people set modest goals 适度的目标；不高的目标 to protect it.

[.my2]
自尊心是谈判中一个巨大的因素，许多人设定适度的目标来保护它。

It's easier to claim victory 声称胜利；宣布获胜 when you aim low。

[.my2]
当你把目标定低时，更容易宣布获胜。

That's why some negotiation experts say that many people who think they have win-win goals 双赢目标；互利目标 really have a wimp-win mentality 懦夫胜利心态；软弱的胜利思维。

[.my2]
这就是为什么一些谈判专家说许多认为他们有双赢目标的人实际上有一种懦夫胜利心态。

The wimp-win negotiator focuses on his or her bottom line and that's where they end up 最终到达；最终结果。

[.my2]
懦夫胜利的谈判者关注他或她的底线，而那就是他们最终到达的地方。

So if BATNA isn't your centerpiece, what should be? I tell my clients that as part of their preparation, they should think about the outcome extremes 结果的极端；结果的两端, best and worst.

[.my2]
那么如果 BATNA 不是你的核心，什么应该是？我告诉我的客户，作为他们准备工作的一部分，他们应该考虑结果的两端，最好和最坏。

If you've got both ends covered 涵盖两端；兼顾两头, you'll be ready for anything。

[.my2]
如果你兼顾了两头，你就会为任何事情做好准备。

So know what you cannot accept and have an idea about the best case outcome 最佳结果；最好结局。

[.my2]
所以知道你不能接受什么，并对最佳结果有一个想法。

But keep in mind that 记住；考虑到 since there's information yet to be acquired 尚未获得的信息；待获取的资料 from the other side, it's quite possible 很有可能；十分可能 that best case might be even better than you know.

[.my2]
但请记住，由于还有尚未获得的来自对方的信息，最好的情况很可能比你知道的更好。

Remember, never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't take something better 绝对不要如此确定你想要的东西，以至于不接受更好的东西。

[.my2]
记住，绝对不要如此确定你想要的东西，以至于你不会接受更好的东西。

Once you've got flexibility 灵活性；弹性 in the forefront of your mind 在你的脑海中处于最前面；首先考虑, you come into a negotiation with a winning mindset 胜利心态；赢家思维。

[.my2]
一旦你首先考虑了灵活性，你就会以胜利心态进入谈判。

Let's say you're selling old speakers 扬声器；音箱 because you need $100$ to put toward 投入；用于 a new set.

[.my2]
比方说你正在出售旧音箱，因为你需要 $100$ 美元来投入到一套新的音箱中。

If you concentrate on 集中于；专注于 the $100$ minimum, you'll relax when you hear that number, and that's what you'll get.

[.my2]
如果你集中于 $100$ 美元的最低要求，当你听到那个数字时，你会放松，而那就是你会得到的东西。

But if you know that they are for sale in used audio stores 二手音响店；二手音频店 for $140$, you could set a high-end goal 高端目标；最高目标 of $150$ while remaining open to 保持开放；愿意接受 better things.

[.my2]
但如果你知道它们在二手音响店以 $140$ 美元出售，你可以设定一个 $150$ 美元的最高目标，同时对更好的事情保持开放。

Now, while I counsel 建议；劝告 thinking about a best/worst range 范围；幅度 to give my clients the security of some structure 结构；框架, when it comes to 说到；谈到 what actually goes on your one sheet, my advice is to just stick with 坚持；保持 the high-end goal, as it will motivate 激励；激发 and focus your psychological powers 心理力量；精神力量, priming you to think 让你做好心理准备 to think you are facing a loss for any term 条款；条件 that falls short 不足；达不到要求。

[.my2]
现在，虽然我建议考虑一个最好/最坏的范围来给我的客户一些结构上的安全感，但谈到实际上写在你的单页纸上的东西，我的建议是只坚持最高目标，因为它将激励和集中你的心理力量，让你做好心理准备认为你正在面临任何达不到要求的条件的损失。

Decades 几十年；长时期 of goal setting research 目标设定研究；目标确定调查 is clear that people who set specific 具体的；明确的, challenging 具有挑战性的；困难的, but realistic 实际的；现实的 goals end up getting 最终获得；最终达成 better deals 比…更好的交易；更有利的协议 than those who don't set goals or simply strive to do their best 仅仅努力做到最好；只求尽力而为。

[.my2]
几十年的目标设定研究清楚地表明，设定具体、具有挑战性但现实的目标的人最终会获得比那些不设定目标或仅仅努力做到最好的人更好的交易。

Bottom line 底线；最重要的是, people who expect more and articulate 清楚地表达；明确说明 it get more.

[.my2]
最重要的是，期望更多并清楚地表达它的人会得到更多。

Here are the four steps for setting your goal.

[.my2]
以下是设定目标的四个步骤。

仅仅用几句话总结并写出导致谈判的已知事实。

You're going to have to have something to talk about beyond 超过；除了 a self-serving assessment 利己的评估；自私的判断 of what you want.

[.my2]
除了对你想要什么的利己评估之外，你将不得不有一些可谈论的内容。

And you had better be ready to respond with tactical empathy 策略性的同理心；战术性的共情 to your counterparts arguments 论点；论据。

[.my2]
你最好准备好以策略性的同理心来回应你的对手的论点。

Unless they're incompetent 无能的；不称职的, the other party 一方；另一方 will come prepared to argue an interpretation 解释；理解 of the facts that favors them 对他们有利；偏袒他们。

[.my2]
除非他们无能，否则另一方会准备好争辩一种对他们有利的事实解释。

[.my2]
一开始就达成共识。

You have to clearly describe the lay of the land 地形；形势 before you can think about acting in its confines 范围；界限。

[.my2]

Find the black swan. + 

At 11:30 a.m. + 

on June 17th, 1981, a beautiful 70°ree spring day with an insistent westerly breeze, 37year-old William Griffin left the second floor bedroom where he lived in his parents' Rochester, New York home and trod down the shoe buffed stairs that led to their meticulous living room. + 

at the bottom. + 

He stopped, paused, and then without a word of warning shot off three shotgun blasts that killed his mother and a handyman who was hanging wallpaper and critically wounded his stepfather. + 

The sound reverberated in the enclosed space. + 

Griffin then left the house and shot a workman and two bystanders as he jogged two blocks to the security trust company, a neighborhood bank. + 

Seconds after he entered, people began sprinting from the bank as Griffin took nine bank employees hostage and ordered the customers to leave. + 

For the next three and a half hours, Griffin led police and FBI agents in a violent standoff in which he shot and wounded the first two police officers who responded to the bank's silent alarm and shot six people who happened to be walking near the bank. + 

Griffin shot off so many rounds, more than 100 in all, that the police used a garbage truck to shield one officer as he was being rescued. + 

Waving the nine bank employees into a small office at 2:30 p.m. + 

m Griffin told the manager to call the police and deliver a message. + 

Outside, FBI agent Clint Vanzant stood by while Rochester police officer Jim O'Brien picked up the phone. + 

Either you come to the front entrance doors of the bank at 3:00 and have a shootout with him in the parking lot, the manager blurted through her tears, or he's going to start killing hostages and throwing out bodies. + 

Then the line went dead. + 

Now, never in the history of the United States had a hostage taker killed a hostage on deadline. + 

The deadline was always a way to focus the mind. + 

What the bad guys really wanted was money, respect, and a helicopter. + 

Everyone knew that. + 

It was a permanent and inalterable known known. + 

It was the truth. + 

But that permanent and inalterable truth was about to change. + 

What came next showed the power of black swans, those hidden and unexpected pieces of information, those unknown unknowns whose unearthing has game-changing effects on a negotiation dynamic. + 

Negotiation breakthroughs when the game shifts inalterably in your favor are created by those who can identify and utilize black swans. + 

Here's how. + 

finding leverage in the predictably unpredictable. + 

At exactly 300 p.m., Griffin gestured toward one of his hostages, a 29-year-old teller named Margaret Moore, and told her to walk to the glass bank doors. + 

Petrified, Moore did as she was ordered, but first cried out that she was a single parent with a young son. + 

Griffin didn't seem to hear her or to care. + 

Once the weeping Moore made it to the vestibule, Griffin shot off two blasts from his 12- gauge shotgun. + 

Both of the heavy rounds struck Moore in the midsection, violently blowing her through the glass door and almost cutting her body in half. + 

Outside, law enforcement was stunned into silence. + 

It was obvious that Griffin didn't want money or respect or an escape route. + 

The only way he was coming out was in a body bag. + 

At that moment, Griffin walked over to a fulllength bank window and pressed his body against the glass. + 

He was in full view of a sniper stationed in the church across the street. + 

Griffin knew quite well the sniper was there. + 

Earlier in the day, he'd shot at him. + 

Less than a second after Griffin's silhouette appeared in his scope, the sniper pulled the trigger. + 

Griffin crumpled to the floor, dead. + 

Black swan theory tells us that things happen that were previously thought to be impossible or never thought of at all. + 

This is not the same as saying that sometimes things happen against one ina- million odds, but rather that things never imagined do come to pass. + 

The idea of the black swan was popularized by risk analyst Nasim Nicholas Taleb in his best-selling books Fooled by Randomness 2001 and the black swan 2007. + 

But the term goes back much further. + 

Until the 17th century, people could only imagine white swans because all swans ever seen had possessed white feathers. + 

In 17th century London, it was common to refer to impossible things as black swans. + 

But then the Dutch explorer William Deleming went to Western Australia in 1697 and saw a black swan. + 

Suddenly the unthinkable and unthought was real. + 

People had always predicted that the next swan they saw would be white, but the discovery of black swans shattered this worldview. + 

Black swans are just a metaphor, of course. + 

Think of Pearl Harbor, the rise of the internet, 9/11, and the recent banking crisis. + 

None of the events above was predicted. + 

Yet, on reflection, the markers were all there. + 

It's just that people weren't paying attention. + 

As Taleb uses the term, the black swan symbolizes the uselessness of predictions based on previous experience. + 

Black swans are events or pieces of knowledge that sit outside our regular expectations and therefore cannot be predicted. + 

This is a crucial concept in negotiation. + 

In every negotiating session, there are different kinds of information. + 

There are those things we know like our counterparts name and their offer and our experiences from other negotiations. + 

Those are known knowns. + 

There are those things we are certain that exist, but we don't know. + 

Like the possibility that the other side might get sick and leave us with another counterpart. + 

Those are known unknowns, and they are like poker wild cards. + 

You know, they're out there, but you don't know who has them. + 

But most important are those things we don't know that we don't know. + 

Pieces of information we've never imagined, but that would be game-changing if uncovered. + 

Maybe our counterpart wants the deal to fail because he's leaving for a competitor. + 

These unknown unknowns are black swans. + 

With their known knowns and prior expectations so firmly guiding their approach, Vanzant and really the entire FBI were blind to the clues and connections that showed there was something outside of the predictable at play. + 

They couldn't see the black swans in front of them. + 

I don't mean to single out Vanzant here. + 

He did all of law enforcement a service by highlighting this event and he told me and a room full of agents the story of that horrible June day during a training session at Quantico. + 

It was an introduction to the suicide by cop phenomenon when an individual deliberately creates a crisis situation to provoke a lethal response from law enforcement. + 

But there was an even greater lesson at stake. + 

The point of the story then and now was how important it is to recognize the unexpected, to make sure things like Moore's death never happen again. + 

On that day in June 1981, O'Brien kept calling the bank, but each time the bank employee who answered quickly hung up. + 

It was at that moment they should have realized the situation was outside the known. + 

Hostage takers always talked because they always had demands. + 

They always wanted to be heard, respected, and paid. + 

But this guy didn't. + 

Then midway through the standoff, a police officer entered the command post with the news that a double homicide with a third person critically wounded had been reported a few blocks away. + 

Do we need to know this? Vanzan said. + 

Is there a connection? No one knew or found out in time. + 

If they had, they might have uncovered a second black swan that Griffin had already killed several people without making monetary demands. + 

And then a few hours in, the hostage taker had one of the hostages read a note to the police over the phone. + 

Curiously, there were no demands. + 

Instead, it was a rambling diet tribe about Griffin's life and the wrongs he'd endured. + 

The note was so long and unfocused, it was never read in its entirety. + 

Because of this, one important line, another black swan, wasn't registered. + 

After the police take my life because these black swans weren't uncovered, Vanzant and his colleagues never saw the situation for what it was. + 

Griffin wanted to die, and he wanted the police to do it for him. + 

Nothing like this. + 

a shootout on a deadline had ever happened to the FBI. + 

So, they tried to fit the information into what had happened in the past into the old templates. + 

They wondered, "What does he actually want?" After scaring them for a bit, they expected Griffin to pick up the phone and start a dialogue. + 

No one gets killed on deadline. + 

Or so they thought. + 

Uncovering unknown unknowns. + 

The lesson of what happened at 300 p.m. + 

on June 17th, 1981 in Rochester, New York, was that when bits and pieces of a case don't add up, it's usually because our frames of reference are off. + 

They will never add up unless we break free of our expectations. + 

Every case is new. + 

We must let what we know, our known knowns, guide us, but not blind us to what we do not know. + 

We must remain flexible and adaptable to any situation. + 

We must always retain a beginner's mind. + 

And we must never overvalue our experience or undervalue theformational and emotional realities served up moment by moment in whatever situation we face. + 

But those were not the only important lessons of that tragic event. + 

If an over reliance on known knowns can shackle a negotiator to assumptions that prevent him from seeing and hearing all that a situation presents, then perhaps an enhanced receptivity to the unknown unknowns can free that same negotiator to see and hear the things that can produce dramatic breakthroughs. + 

From the moment I heard the tale of June 17th, 1981, I realized that I had to completely change how I approached negotiating. + 

I began to hypothesize that in every negotiation, each side is in possession of at least three black swans. + 

Three pieces of information that were worthy to be discovered by the other side would change everything. + 

My experience since has proven this to be true. + 

Now, I should note here that this is not just a small tweak to negotiation technique. + 

It is not coincidence that I embraced black swan as the name of my company and the symbol of our approach. + 

Finding and acting on black swans mandates a shift in your mindset. + 

It takes negotiation from being a one-dimensional move countermove game of checkers to a three-dimensional game that's more emotional, adaptive, intuitive, and truly effective. + 

Finding black swans is no easy task. + 

Of course, we are all to some degree blind. + 

We do not know what is around the corner until we turn it. + 

By definition, we do not know what we don't know. + 

That's why I say that finding and understanding black swans requires a change of mindset. + 

You have to open up your established pathways and embrace more intuitive and nuanced ways of listening. + 

This is vital to people of all walks of life, from negotiators to inventors and marketers. + 

What you don't know can kill you or your deal. + 

But to find it out is incredibly difficult. + 

The most basic challenge is that people don't know the questions to ask the customer, the user, the counterpart. + 

Unless correctly interrogated, most people aren't able to articulate the information you want. + 

The world didn't tell Steve Jobs that it wanted an iPad. + 

He uncovered our need, that black swan, without us knowing the information was there. + 

The problem is that conventional questioning and research techniques are designed to confirm known knowns and reduce uncertainty. + 

They don't dig into the unknown. + 

Negotiations will always suffer from limited predictability. + 

Your counterpart might tell you it's a lovely plot of land without mentioning that it is also a super fun site. + 

They'll say, "Are the neighbors noisy?" Well, everyone makes a bit of noise, don't they? When the actual fact is that a heavy metal band practices their nightly. + 

It is the person best able to unearth, adapt to, and exploit the unknowns that will come out on top. + 

To uncover these unknowns, we must interrogate our world. + 

Must put out a call and intensely listen to the response. + 

Ask lots of questions, read non-verbal clues, and always voice your observations with your counterpart. + 

This is nothing beyond what you've been learning up to now. + 

It is merely more intense and intuitive. + 

You have to feel for the truth behind the camouflage. + 

You have to note the small pauses that suggest discomfort and lies. + 

Don't look to verify what you expect. + 

If you do, that's what you'll find. + 

Instead, you must open yourself up to the factual reality that is in front of you. + 

This is why my company changed its format for preparing and engaging in a negotiation. + 

No matter how much research our team has done prior to the interaction, we always ask ourselves why are they communicating what they are communicating right now. + 

Remember, negotiation is more like walking on a tight rope than competing against an opponent. + 

Focusing so much on the end objective will only distract you from the next step, and that can cause you to fall off the rope. + 

Concentrate on the next step because the rope will lead you to the end as long as all the steps are completed. + 

Most people expect that black swans are highly proprietary or closely guarded information when in fact the information may seem completely innocuous. + 

Either side may be completely oblivious to its importance. + 

Your counterpart always has pieces of information whose value they do not understand. + 

the three types of leverage. + 

I'm going to come back to specific techniques for uncovering black swans, but first I'd like to examine what makes them so useful. + 

The answer is leverage. + 

Black swans are leverage multipliers. + 

They give you the upper hand. + 

Now, leverage is the magic word, but it's also one of those concepts that negotiation experts casually throw about, but rarely delve into. + 

So, I'd like to do so here. + 

In theory, leverage is the ability to inflict loss and withhold gain. + 

Where does your counterpart want to gain and what do they fear losing? Discover these pieces of information, we are told, and you'll build leverage over the other side's perceptions, actions, and decisions. + 

In practice, where our irrational perceptions are our reality, loss and gain are slippery notions. + 

And it often doesn't matter what leverage actually exists against you. + 

What really matters is the leverage they think you have on them. + 

That's why I say there's always leverage. + 

As an essentially emotional concept, it can be manufactured whether it exists or not. + 

If they're talking to you, you have leverage. + 

Who has leverage in a kidnapping? The kidnapper or the victim's family? Most people think the kidnapper has all the leverage. + 

Sure, the kidnapper has something you love, but you have something they lust for. + 

Which is more powerful? Moreover, how many buyers do the kidnappers have for the commodity they're trying to sell? What business is successful if there's only one buyer? Leverage has a lot of inputs like time and necessity and competition. + 

If you need to sell your house now, you have less leverage than if you don't have a deadline. + 

If you want to sell it but don't have to, you have more. + 

And if various people are bidding on it at once, good on you. + 

I should note that leverage isn't the same thing as power. + 

Donald Trump has tons of power, but if he's stranded in a desert and the owner of the only store for miles has the water he wants, the vendor has the leverage. + 

One way to understand leverage is as a fluid that sloshes between the parties. + 

As a negotiator, you should always be aware of which side at any given moment feels they have the most to lose if negotiations collapse. + 

The party who feels they have more to lose and are the most afraid of that loss has less leverage and vice versa. + 

To get leverage, you have to persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose if the deal falls through. + 

At a taxonomic level, there are three kinds, positive, negative, and normative. + 

Positive leverage. + 

Positive leverage is quite simply your ability as a negotiator to provide or withhold things that your counterpart wants. + 

Whenever the other side says, "I want," as in, "I want to buy your car," you have positive leverage. + 

When they say that, you have power. + 

You can make their desire come true. + 

You can withhold it and thereby inflict pain. + 

Or you can use their desire to get a better deal with another party. + 

Here's an example. + 

Three months after you've put your business on the market, a potential buyer finally tells you, "Yes, I'd like to buy it." You're thrilled, but a few days later, your joy turns to disappointment when he delivers an offer so low it's insulting. + 

This is the only offer you have. + 

So, what do you do? Now, hopefully you've had contact with other buyers, even casually. + 

If you have, you can use the offer to create a sense of competition and thereby kick off a bidding war. + 

At least you'll force them to make a choice. + 

But even if you don't have other offers or the interested buyer is your first choice, you have more power than before your counterpart revealed his desire. + 

You control what they want. + 

That's why experienced negotiators delay making offers. + 

They don't want to give up leverage. + 

Positive leverage should improve your psychology during negotiation. + 

You've gone from a situation where you want something from the investor to a situation where you both want something from each other. + 

Once you have it, you can then identify other things your opponent wants. + 

Maybe he wants to buy your firm over time. + 

Help him do that if he'll increase the price. + 

Maybe his offer is all the money he has. + 

Help him get what he wants, your business, by saying you can only sell him 75% for his offer. + 

Negative leverage. + 

Negative leverage is what most civilians picture when they hear the word leverage. + 

It's a negotiator's ability to make his counterpart suffer and it is based on threats. + 

You have negative leverage if you can tell your counterpart, "If you don't fulfill your commitment, pay your bill, etc., I will destroy your reputation. + 

This sort of leverage gets people's attention because of a concept we've discussed, loss aversion. + 

As effective negotiators have long known and psychologists have repeatedly proved, potential losses loom larger in the human mind than do similar gains. + 

Getting a good deal may push us toward making a risky bet, but saving our reputation from destruction is a much stronger motivation. + 

So, what kind of black swans do you look to be aware of as negative leverage? Effective negotiators look for pieces of information, often obliquely revealed, that show what is important to their counterpart. + 

Who is their audience? What signifies status and reputation to them? What most worries them? To find this information, one method is to go outside the negotiating table and speak to a third party that knows your counterpart. + 

The most effective method is to gather it from interactions with your counterpart. + 

That said, a word of warning. + 

I do not believe in making direct threats and am extremely careful with even subtle ones. + 

Threats can be like nuclear bombs. + 

There will be a toxic residue that will be difficult to clean up. + 

You have to handle the potential of negative consequences with care, or you will hurt yourself and poison or blow up the whole process. + 

If you shove your negative leverage down your counterparts throat, it might be perceived as you taking away their autonomy. + 

People will often sooner die than give up their autonomy. + 

They'll at least act irrationally and shut off the negotiation. + 

A more subtle technique is to label your negative leverage and thereby make it clear without attacking sentences like it seems like you strongly value the fact that you've always paid on time or it seems like you don't care what position you are leaving me in can really open up the negotiation process. + 

Normative leverage. + 

Every person has a set of rules and a moral framework. + 

Normative leverage is using the other party's norms and standards to advance your position. + 

If you can show inconsistencies between their beliefs and their actions, you have normative leverage. + 

No one likes to look like a hypocrite. + 

For example, if your counterpart lets slip that they generally pay a certain multiple of cash flow when they buy a company, you can frame your desired price in a way that reflects that valuation. + 

Discovering the black swans that give you normative valuation can be as easy as asking what your counterpart believes and listening openly. + 

You want to see what language they speak and speak it back to them. + 

Know their religion. + 

In March 2003, I led the negotiation with a farmer who became one of the most unlikely post 911 terrorists you can imagine. + 

The drama started when Dwight Watson, a North Carolina tobacco grower, hooked up his Jeep to a John Deere tractor foned with banners and an inverted US flag and towed it to Washington DC to protest government policies he thought were putting tobacco farmers out of business. + 

When Watson got to the capital, he pulled his tractor into a pond between the Washington Monument and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and threatened to blow it up with the Organo phosphate bombs he claimed were inside. + 

The capital went into lockdown as the police blocked off an eightb block area from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument. + 

Coming just months after the beltway sniper attacks and alongside the buildup to the Iraq war, the ease with which Watson threw the nation's capital into turmoil freaked people out. + 

Talking on his cell phone, Watson told the Washington Post that he was on a do or die mission to show how reduced subsidies were killing tobacco farmers. + 

He told the Post that God had instructed him to stage his protest and he wasn't going to leave. + 

If this is the way America will be run the hell with it, he said, I will not surrender. + 

They can blow me out of the water. + 

I'm ready to go to heaven. + 

The FBI deployed me to a converted RV on the National Mall where I was to guide a team of FBI agents and US Park Police as we tried to talk Watson out of killing himself and who knows how many others. + 

And then we got down to business. + 

Like you'd expect of a negotiation with a guy threatening to destroy a good part of the US capital, it was righteously tense. + 

Sharpshooters had their weapons trained on Watson, and they had the green light to shoot if he made any crazy moves. + 

In any negotiation, but especially in a tense one like this, it's not how well you speak, but how well you listen that determines your success. + 

Understanding the other is a precondition to be able to speak persuasively and develop options that resonate for them. + 

There is the visible negotiation and then all the things that are hidden under the surface, the secret negotiation space wherein the black swans dwell. + 

Access to this hidden space very often comes through understanding the other side's worldview, their reason for being, their religion. + 

Indeed, digging into your counterpart's religion, sometimes involving God, but not always, inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional, and otherwise, of your counterpart. + 

Once you've understood your counterpart's world view, you can build influence. + 

That's why, as we talked with Watson, I spent my energy trying to unearth who he was rather than logically arguing him into surrender. + 

From this, we learned that Watson had been finding it increasingly hard to make a living on his 12,200 acre tobacco farm, which had been in his family for five generations. + 

After being hit by a drought and having his crop quota cut by half, Watson decided he couldn't afford the farm anymore and drove to Washington to make his point. + 

He wanted attention and knowing what he wanted gave us positive leverage. + 

Watson also told us he was a veteran and veterans had rules. + 

this is the kind of music you want to hear as it provides normative leverage. + 

He told us that he would be willing to surrender but not right away. + 

As a military police officer in the 82nd Airborne in the 1970s, he learned that if he was trapped behind enemy lines, he could withdraw with honor if reinforcements didn't arrive within 3 days, but not before. + 

Now, we had articulated rules we could hold him to. + 

And the admission that he could withdraw also implied that despite his bluster about dying, he wanted to live. + 

One of the first things you try to decide in a hostage negotiation is whether your counterpart's vision of the future involves them living. + 

One of the first things you try to decide in a hostage negotiation is whether your counterpart's vision of the future involves them living. + 

and Watson had answered yes. + 

We used this information a piece of negative leverage as we could take away something he wanted life and started working it alongside the positive leverage of his desire to be heard. + 

We emphasized to Watson that he had already made national news and if he wanted his message to survive, he was going to have to live. + 

Watson was smart enough to understand that there was a real chance he wouldn't make it out alive, but he still had his rules of military honor. + 

His own desires and fears helped generate some positive and negative leverage, but they were secondary to the norms by which he lived his life. + 

It was tempting to just wait until the third day, but I doubted we'd get that far. + 

With each passing hour, the atmosphere was growing tenser. + 

The capital was under siege, and we had reason to believe he might have explosives. + 

If he made one wrong move, one freakout, the snipers would kill him. + 

He'd already had several angry outbursts, so every hour that passed endangered him. + 

He could still get himself killed. + 

But we couldn't hit on that at all. + 

We couldn't threaten to kill him and expect that to work. + 

The reason for that is something called the paradox of power. + 

Namely, the harder we push, the more likely we are to be met with resistance. + 

That's why you have to use negative leverage sparingly. + 

Still, time was short and we had to speed things up. + 

But how? What happened next was one of those glorious examples of how deeply listening to understand your counterpart's worldview can reveal a black swan that transforms a negotiation dynamic. + 

Watson didn't directly tell us what we needed to know, but by close attention, we uncovered a subtle truth that informed everything he said. + 

About 36 hours in, Winnie Miller, an FBI agent on our team who'd been listening intently to subtle references Watson had been making, turned to me. + 

"He's a devout Christian," she told me. + 

"Tell him is the dawn of the third day. + 

That's the day Christians believe Jesus Christ left his tomb and ascended to heaven. + 

If Christ came out on the dawn of the third day, why not Watson? It was a brilliant use of deep listening. + 

By combining that subtext of Watson's words with knowledge of his worldview, she let us show Watson that we not only were listening, but that we had also heard him. + 

If we'd understood his subtext correctly, this would let him end the standoff honorably and to do so with the feeling that he was surrendering to an adversary that respected him and his beliefs. + 

By positioning your demands within the worldview your counterpart uses to make decisions, you show them respect and that gets you attention and results. + 

Knowing your counterpart's religion is more than just gaining normative leverage, per se. + 

Rather, it's gaining a holistic understanding of your counterpart's worldview, in this case, literally a religion, and using that knowledge to inform your negotiating moves. + 

Using your counterparts religion is extremely effective, in large part because it has authority over them. + 

The other guy's religion is what the market, the experts, God, or society, whatever matters to him, has determined to be fair and just, and people defer to that authority. + 

In the next conversation with Watson, we mentioned that the next morning was the dawn of the third day. + 

There was a long moment of silence on the other end of the line. + 

Our negotiation operation center was so quiet you could hear the heartbeat of the guy next to you. + 

Watson coughed. + 

"I'll come out," he said. + 

And he did, ending a 48-hour standoff, saving himself from harm and allowing the nation's capital to resume its normal life. + 

No explosives were found. + 

While the importance of knowing their religion should be clear from Watson's story, here are two tips for reading religion correctly. + 

Review everything you hear. + 

You will not hear everything the first time, so double check. + 

Compare notes with your team members. + 

You will often discover new information that will help you advance the negotiation. + 

Use backup listeners whose only job is to listen between the lines. + 

They will hear things you miss. + 

In other words, listen, listen again, and listen some more. + 

We've seen how a holistic understanding of your counterpart's religion, a huge black swan, can provide normative leverage that leads to negotiating results. + 

But there are other ways in which learning your counterparts religion, enables you to achieve better outcomes. + 

The similarity principle. + 

Research by social scientists has confirmed something effective negotiators have known for ages. + 

Namely, we trust people more when we view them as being similar or familiar. + 

People trust those who are in their inroup. + 

Belonging is a primal instinct. + 

And if you can trigger that instinct, that sense that oh, we see the world the same way, then you immediately gain influence. + 

When our counterpart displays attitudes, beliefs, ideas, even modes of dress that are similar to our own, we tend to like and trust them more. + 

Similarities as shallow as club memberships or college alumni status increase rapport. + 

That's why in many cultures, negotiators spend large amounts of time building rapport before they even think of offers. + 

Both sides know that the information they glean could be vital to effective deal making and leverage building. + 

It's a bit like dogs circling each other, smelling each other's behind. + 

I once worked a deal for our services with this CEO in Ohio where the similarity principle played a major role. + 

My counterpart was constantly making references that I recognized as being sort of bornagain Christian material. + 

As we talked, he kept going back and forth on whether he should bring in his adviserss. + 

The whole issue of his adviserss clearly pained him. + 

At one point, he even said, "Nobody understands me." At that moment, I began to rack my brain for the Christian word that captured the essence of what he was saying. + 

And then the term came to my mind, a term people often used in church to describe the duty one had to administer our own and our worlds. + 

and therefore God's resources with honesty, accountability, and responsibility. + 

This is really stewardship for you, isn't it? I said, his voice immediately strengthened. + 

Yes, you're the only one who understands, he said. + 

And he hired us at that moment. + 

By showing that I understood his deeper reasons for being and accessing a sense of similarity of mutual belongingness, I was able to bring him to the deal. + 

The minute I established a kind of shared identity with this Christian, we were in not simply because of similarity alone, but because of the understanding implied by that moment of similarity. + 

The power of hopes and dreams. + 

Once you know your counterpart's religion and can visualize what he truly wants out of life, you can employ those aspirations as a way to get him to follow you. + 

Every engineer, every executive, every child, all of us want to believe we are capable of the extraordinary. + 

As children, our daydreams feature ourselves as primary players in great moments. + 

An actor winning an Oscar, an athlete hitting the game-winning shot. + 

As we grow older, however, our parents, teachers, and friends talk more of what we can't and shouldn't do than what is possible. + 

We begin to lose faith. + 

But when someone displays a passion for what we've always wanted and conveys a purposeful plan of how to get there, we allow our perceptions of what's possible to change. + 

We're all hungry for a map to joy. + 

And when someone is courageous enough to draw it for us, we naturally follow. + 

So when you ascertain your counterparts unattained goals, invoke your own power and followability by expressing passion for their goals and for their ability to achieve them. + 

Ted Leonsis is great at this. + 

As the owner of the Washington Wizards professional basketball team and the Washington Capitals professional hockey team, he is always talking about creating the immortal moments in sports that people will tell their grandchildren about. + 

Who doesn't want to come to an agreement with someone who is going to make them immortal? Religion as a reason. + 

Research studies have shown that people respond favorably to requests made in a reasonable tone of voice and followed with a because reason. + 

In a famous study from the late 1970s, Harvard psychology professor Ellen Langanger and her colleagues approached people waiting for copy machines and asked if they could cut the line. + 

Sometimes they gave a reason, sometimes they didn't. + 

What she found was crazy. + 

Without her giving a reason, 60% let her through. + 

But when she did give one, more than 90% did, and it didn't matter if the reason made sense. + 

Excuse me, I have five pages. + 

May I cut in line because I have to make copies? Worked great. + 

People just responded positively to the framework. + 

While idiotic reasons worked with something simple like photocopying, on more complicated issues, you can increase your effectiveness by offering reasons that reference your counterparts religion. + 

Had that Christian CEO offered me a lowball offer when he agreed to hire my firm, I might have answered, "I'd love to, but I too have a duty to be a responsible steward of my resources." It's not crazy. + 

It's a clue. + 

It's not human nature to embrace the unknown. + 

It scares us. + 

When we are confronted by it, we ignore it. + 

We run away or we label it in ways that allow us to dismiss it. + 

In negotiations, that label most often takes the form of the statement, "They're crazy." That's one reason I've been highly critical of some of the implementation of America's hostage negotiation policy, which is that we don't negotiate with those we refer broadly to as the terrorists, including groups from the Taliban to ISIS. + 

The rationale for this non-engagement is summarized well by the journalist Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst. + 

Negotiations with religious fanatics who have delusions of grandeur generally do not go well. + 

The alternative we've chosen is to not understand their religion, their fanaticism, and their delusions. + 

Instead of negotiations that don't go well, we shrug our shoulders and say they're crazy. + 

But that's absolutely wrongheaded. + 

We must understand these things. + 

I'm not saying that because I'm a soft-headed pacifist. + 

The FBI doesn't hire agents like that, but because I know understanding such things is the best way to discover the other side's vulnerabilities and wants and thereby gain influence. + 

You can't get that stuff unless you talk. + 

No one is immune to they're crazy. + 

You can see it rear its head in every kind of negotiation from parenting to congressional deal making to corporate bargaining. + 

But the moment when we're most ready to throw our hands up and declare, "They're crazy." is often the best moment for discovering black swans that transform a negotiation. + 

It is when we hear or see something that doesn't make sense, something crazy, that a crucial fork in the road is presented, push forward even more forcefully into that which we initially can't process or take the other path, the one to guaranteed failure in which we tell ourselves that negotiating was useless anyway. + 

In their great book, Negotiation Genius, four Harvard Business School professors, Deepo Malhhatra and Max H. + 

Baserman provide a look at the common reasons negotiators mistakenly call their counterparts crazy. + 

I'd like to talk through them here. + 

Mistake number one, they are illinformed. + 

Often the other side is acting on bad information. + 

And when people have bad information, they make bad choices. + 

There's a great computer industry term for this. + 

GGO, garbage in, garbage out. + 

As an example, Malhatra talks about a student of his who was in a dispute with an ex employee who claimed he was owed $130,000 in commissions for work he had done before being fired. + 

He was threatening a lawsuit. + 

Confused, the executive turned to the company's accountants. + 

There he discovered the problem. + 

The accounts had been a mess when the employee was fired, but had since been put into order. + 

With the clean information, the accountants assured the executive that in fact the employee owed the company $25,000. + 

Eager to avoid a lawsuit, the executive called the employee, explained the situation, and made an offer. + 

If the employee dropped the lawsuit, he could keep the $25,000. + 

To his surprise, the employee said that he was going forward with the suit anyway. + 

He acted irrational, crazy. + 

Malhhatra told his student that the problem was not craziness, but a lack of information and trust. + 

So, the executive had an outside accounting firm audit the numbers and send the results to the employee. + 

The result, the employee dropped the suit. + 

The clear point here is that people operating with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different information. + 

Your job when faced with someone like this in a negotiation is to discover what they do not know and supply that information. + 

Mistake hash two. + 

They are constrained. + 

In any negotiation where your counterpart is acting wobbly, there exists a distinct possibility that they have things they can't do but aren't eager to reveal. + 

Such constraints can make the sest counterpart seem irrational. + 

The other side might not be able to do something because of legal advice or because of promises already made or even to avoid setting a precedent or they may just not have the power to close the deal. + 

That last situation is one that a client of mine faced as he was trying to land CocaCola as a client for his marketing firm. + 

The guy had been negotiating a deal for months and it was getting on to November. + 

He was petrified that if he didn't close it before the calendar year ended, he would have to wait for Coca-Cola to set a new budget and he might lose the client. + 

The problem was that his contact had suddenly stopped responding. + 

So, we told him to send a version of our classic email for non-responders, the one that always works. + 

Have you given up on finalizing this deal this year? Then something weird happened. + 

The Coca-Cola contact didn't respond to the perfect email. + 

What was up? This was superficially quite irrational, but the contact had been a straightup guy until then. + 

We told our client this could mean only one thing, that the guy had given up on closing the deal by the end of the year, but he didn't want to admit it. + 

There had to be some constraint. + 

With this knowledge in hand, we had our client dig deep. + 

After a batch of phone calls and emails, he tracked down someone who knew his contact. + 

And it turned out we had been right. + 

The contacts division had been in chaos for weeks. + 

And in the midst of corporate infighting, he had completely lost influence. + 

Not surprisingly, he was embarrassed to admit it. + 

That's why he was avoiding my client. + 

To put it simply, he had major constraints. + 

Mistake hash three. + 

They have other interests. + 

Think back to William Griffin, the first man ever to kill a hostage on deadline. + 

What the FBI and police negotiators on the scene simply did not know was that his main interest was not negotiating a deal to release the hostages from money. + 

He wanted to be killed by a cop. + 

Had they been able to dig up that hidden interest, they might have been able to avoid some of that day's tragedy. + 

The presence of hidden interests isn't as rare as you might think. + 

Your counterpart will often reject offers for reasons that have nothing to do with their merits. + 

A client may put off buying your product so that their calendar year closes before the invoice hits, increasing his chance for a promotion. + 

Or an employee might quit in the middle of a career-making project just before bonus season because he or she has learned that colleagues are making more money. + 

For that employee, fairness is as much an interest as money. + 

Whatever the specifics of the situation, these people are not acting irrationally. + 

They are simply complying with needs and desires that you don't yet understand what the world looks like to them based on their own set of rules. + 

Your job is to bring these black swans to light. + 

As we've seen, when you recognize that your counterpart is not irrational, but simply ill-informed, constrained, or obeying interests that you do not yet know, your field of movement greatly expands, and that allows you to negotiate much more effectively. + 

Here are a few ways to unearth these powerful black swans. + 

Get facetime. + 

Black swans are incredibly hard to uncover if you're not literally at the table. + 

No matter how much research you do, there's just some information that you are not going to find out unless you sit face to face. + 

Today, a lot of younger people do almost everything over email. + 

It's just how things are done. + 

But it's very difficult to find black swans with email for the simple reason that even if you knock your counterpart off their moorings with great labels and calibrated questions, email gives them too much time to think and reenter themselves to avoid revealing too much. + 

In addition, email doesn't allow for tone of voice effects and it doesn't let you read the nonverbal parts of your counterpart's response. + 

Remember 73855. + 

Let's return now to the tale of my client who was trying to get Coca-Cola as a client, only to learn that his contact at the company had been pushed aside. + 

I realized that the only way my client was going to get a deal with Coca-Cola was by getting his contact to admit that he was useless for the situation and pass my client on to the correct executive. + 

But there was no way this guy wanted to do that because he still imagined that he could be important. + 

So, I told my client to get his contact out of the Coca-Cola complex. + 

You got to get him to dinner. + 

You're going to say, "Would it be a bad idea for me to take you to your favorite steakhouse and we just have a few laughs and we don't talk business?" The idea was that no matter the reason, whether the contact was embarrassed or didn't like my client or just didn't want to discuss the situation, the only way the process was going to move forward was through direct human interaction. + 

So, my client got this guy out for dinner, and as promised, he didn't bring up business. + 

But there was no way not to talk about it. + 

And just because my client created personal face-to-face interaction, the contact admitted he was the he admitted that his division was a mess and he'd have to hand things off to somebody else to get the deal done. + 

And he did. + 

It took more than a year to get the deal signed, but they did it. + 

Observe unguarded moments. + 

While you have to get facetime, formal business meetings, structured encounters, and planned negotiation sessions are often the least revealing kinds of facetime because these are the moments when people are at their most guarded. + 

Hunting for black swans is also effective during unguarded moments at the fringes. + 

Whether at meals like my client had with his Coca-Cola contact or the brief moments of relaxation before or after formal interactions. + 

During a typical business meeting, the first few minutes before you actually get down to business and the last few moments as everyone is leaving often tell you more about the other side than anything in between. + 

That's why reporters have a credo to never turn off their recorders. + 

You always get the best stuff at the beginning and the end of an interview. + 

Also, pay close attention to your counterpart during interruptions, odd exchanges, or anything that interrupts the flow. + 

When someone breaks ranks, people's facads crack just a little. + 

Simply noticing whose cracks and how others respond verbally and non-verbally can reveal a gold mine. + 

When it doesn't make sense, there's sense to be made. + 

Students often ask me whether black swans are specific kinds of information or any kind that helps. + 

I always answer that they are anything that you don't know that changes things. + 

To drive this home, here's the story of one of my MBA students who was interning for a private equity real estate firm in Washington. + 

Faced with actions from his counterpart that didn't pass the sense test, he innocently turned up one of the greatest black swans I've seen in years by using a label. + 

My student had been performing due diligence on potential targets when a principal at the firm asked him to look into a mixeduse property in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina. + 

He had no experience in the Charleston market, so he called the broker selling the property and requested the marketing package. + 

After discussing the deal in the market, my student and his boss decided that the asking price of $4.3 million was about $450,000 too high. + 

At that point, my student called the broker again to discuss pricing and next steps. + 

After initial pleasantries, the broker asked my student what he thought of the property. + 

It looks like an interesting property, he said. + 

Unfortunately, we don't know the market fundamentals. + 

We like downtown and King Street in particular, but we have a lot of questions. + 

The broker then told him that he had been in the market for more than 15 years, so he was well informed. + 

At this point, my student pivoted to calibrated how and what questions in order to gather information and judge the broker skills. + 

"Great," my student said. + 

"First and foremost, how has Charleston been affected by the economic downturn?" The broker replied with a detailed answer citing specific examples of market improvement. + 

In the process, he showed my student that he was very knowledgeable. + 

It sounds like I'm in good hands, he said, using a label to build empathy. + 

Next question. + 

What sort of cap rate can be expected in this type of building? Through the ensuing back and forth, my student learned that owners could expect rates of 6 to 7% because buildings like this were popular with students at the local university, a growing school where 60% of the student body lived off campus. + 

He also learned that it would be prohibitively expensive, if not physically impossible, to buy land nearby and build a similar building. + 

In the last 5 years, no one had built on the street because of historic preservation rules. + 

Even if they could buy land, the broker said a similar building would cost $2.5 million just in construction. + 

The building is in great shape, especially compared to the other options available to students, the broker said. + 

It seems like this building functions more as a glorified dormatory than a classic multif family building, my student said, using a label to extract more information. + 

And he got it. + 

Fortunately and unfortunately, yes, the broker said, "The occupancy has historically been 100% and it is a cash cow, but the students act like college students." A light bulb went on in my students head. + 

There was something strange a foot. + 

If it were such a cash cow, why would someone sell a 100% occupied building located next to a growing campus in an affluent city? that was irrational by any measure. + 

A little befuddled, but still in the negotiation mindset, my student constructed a label. + 

Inadvertently, he mislabeled the situation, triggering the broker to correct him and reveal a black swan. + 

If he or she is selling such a cash cow, it seems like the seller must have doubts about future market fundamentals, he said. + 

Well, he said the seller has some tougher properties in Atlanta and Savannah, so he has to get out of this property to pay back the other mortgages. + 

Bingo. + 

With that, my student had unearthed a fantastic black swan. + 

The seller was suffering constraints that until that moment had been unknown. + 

My student put the broker on mute as he described other properties and used the moment to discuss pricing with his boss. + 

He quickly gave him the green light to make a lowball offer, an extreme anchor, to try to yank the broker to his minimum. + 

After quizzing the broker if the seller would be willing to close quickly and getting a yes, my student set his anchor. + 

I think I have heard enough, he said. + 

We are willing to offer $3.4 million. + 

Okay, the broker answered. + 

that is well below the asking price. + 

However, I can bring the offer to the seller and see what he thinks. + 

Later that day, the broker came back with a counter offer. + 

The seller had told him that the number was too low, but he was willing to take $3.7 million. + 

My student could barely keep from falling off his chair. + 

The counter offer was lower than his goal. + 

But rather than jump at the amount and risk leaving value on the table with a wimpin deal, my student pushed further. + 

He said no without using the word. + 

That is closer to what we believe the value to be, he said. + 

But we cannot in good conscience pay more than $3.55 million. + 

Later, my student told me and I agreed that he should have used a label or calibrated question here to push the broker to bid against himself. + 

But he was so surprised by how far the price had dropped that he stumbled into old school haggling. + 

"I am only authorized to go down to 3.6 million," the broker answered, clearly showing that he'd never taken a negotiation class that taught the acriman model and how to pivot to terms to avoid the haggle. + 

My student's boss signaled to him that 3.6 million worked, and he agreed to the price. + 

I've teased several of the techniques my student used to effectively negotiate a great deal for his firm. + 

From the use of labels and calibrated questions to the probing of constraints to unearth a beautiful black swan. + 

It also bears noting that my student did tons of work beforehand and had prepared labels and questions so that he was ready to jump on the black swan when the broker offered it. + 

Once he knew that the seller was trying to get money out of this building to pay off mortgages on the underperforming ones, he knew that timing was important. + 

Of course, there's always room for improvement. + 

Afterward, my student told me he wished he hadn't lowalled the offer so quickly and instead used the opportunity to discuss the other properties. + 

He might have found more investment opportunities within the seller's portfolio. + 

In addition, he could have potentially built more empathy and teased out more unknown unknowns with labels or calibrated questions like, "What markets are you finding difficult right now, maybe even gotten facetime with the seller directly?" Still, well done. + 

Overcoming fear and learning to get what you want out of life. + 

People generally fear conflict, so they avoid useful arguments out of fear that the tone will escalate into personal attacks they cannot handle. + 

People in close relationships often avoid making their own interests known and instead compromise across the board to avoid being perceived as greedy or self-interested. + 

They fold, they grow bitter, and they grow apart. + 

We've all heard of marriages that ended in divorce and the couple never fought. + 

Families are just an extreme version of all parts of humanity, from government to business. + 

Except for a few naturals, everyone hates negotiation at first. + 

Your hands sweat, your fight or flight kicks in, and your thoughts trip drunkenly over themselves. + 

The natural first impulse for most of us is to chicken out, throw in the towel, run. + 

The mere idea of tossing out an extreme anchor is traumatic. + 

That's why wimpwin deals are the norm in the kitchen and in the boardroom. + 

But stop and think about that. + 

Are we really afraid of the guy across the table? I can promise you that with very few exceptions, he's not going to reach across and slug you. + 

No. + 

Our sweaty palms are just an expression of physiological fear. + 

a few trigger-happy neurons firing because of something more base, our innate human desire to get along with other members of the tribe. + 

It's not the guy across the table who scares us. + 

It's conflict itself. + 

If this book accomplishes only one thing, I hope it gets you over that fear of conflict and encourages you to navigate it with empathy. + 

If you're going to be great at anything, a great negotiator, a great manager, a great husband, a great wife, you're going to have to do that. + 

You're going to have to ignore that little genie who's telling you to give up to just get along, as well as that other genie who's telling you to lash out and yell. + 

You're going to have to embrace regular, thoughtful conflict as the basis of effective negotiation and of life. + 

Please remember that our emphasis throughout the book is that the adversary is the situation and that the person that you appear to be in conflict with is actually your partner. + 

More than a little research has shown that genuine, honest conflict between people over their goals actually helps energize the problem-solving process in a collaborative way. + 

Skilled negotiators have a talent for using conflict to keep the negotiation going without stumbling into a personal battle. + 

Remember, pushing hard for what you believe is not selfish. + 

It is not bullying. + 

It is not just helping you. + 

Your amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear, will try to convince you to give up, to flee because the other guy is right or you're being cruel. + 

But if you are an honest, decent person looking for a reasonable outcome, you can ignore the amygdala. + 

With the style of negotiation taught in the book, an information obsessed, empathetic search for the best possible deal, you are trying to uncover value. + 

Period. + 

Not to strongarm or to humiliate. + 

When you ask calibrated questions, yes, you are leading your counterpart to your goals, but you are also leading them to examine and articulate what they want and why and how they can achieve it. + 

You are demanding creativity of them and therefore pushing them toward a collaborative solution. + 

When I bought my red 4erunner, no doubt I disappointed the salesman by giving him a smaller payday than he would have liked, but I helped him reach his quota. + 

And no doubt I paid more for the truck than the car lot had paid Toyota. + 

If all I'd wanted was to win, to humiliate, I would have stolen the thing. + 

And so, I'm going to leave you with one request. + 

Whether it's in the office or around the family dinner table, don't avoid honest, clear conflict. + 

It will get you the best car price, the higher salary, and the largest donation. + 

It will also save your marriage, your friendship and your family. + 

One can only be an exceptional negotiator and a great person by both listening and speaking clearly and empathetically by treating counterparts and oneself with dignity and respect and most of all by being honest about what one wants and what one can and cannot do. + 

Every negotiation, every conversation, every moment of life is a series of small conflicts that managed well can rise to creative beauty. + 

Embrace them. + 

Key lessons. + 

What we don't know can kill us or our deals. + 

But uncovering it can totally change the course of a negotiation and bring us unexpected success. + 

Finding the black swans, those powerful unknown unknowns, is intrinsically difficult. + 

However, for the simple reason that we don't know the questions to ask because we don't know what the treasure is, we don't know where to dig. + 

Here are some of the best techniques for flushing out the black swans and exploiting them. + 

Remember, your counterpart might not even know how important the information is or even that they shouldn't reveal it. + 

So, keep pushing, probing, and gathering information. + 

Let what you know, your known knowns, guide you, but not blind you. + 

Every case is new, so remain flexible and adaptable. + 

Remember the Griffin Bank crisis. + 

No hostage taker had killed a hostage on deadline until he did. + 

Black swans are leverage multipliers. + 

Remember the three types of leverage. + 

Positive, the ability to give someone what they want. + 

Negative, the ability to hurt someone. + 

and normative using your counterparts norms to bring them around. + 

Work to understand the other side's religion. + 

Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional, and otherwise of your counterpart. + 

That's where black swans live. + 

Review everything you hear from your counterpart. + 

You will not hear everything the first time, so double check. + 

Compare notes with team members. + 

Use backup listeners whose job is to listen between the lines. + 

They will hear things you miss. + 

Exploit the similarity principle. + 

People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with. + 

So dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground. + 

When someone seems irrational or crazy, they most likely aren't. + 

Faced with this situation, search for constraints, hidden desires, and bad information. + 

Get facetime with your counterpart. + 

10 minutes of facetime often reveals more than days of research. + 

Pay special attention to your counterparts verbal and non-verbal communication at unguarded moments, at the beginning and the end of the session, or when someone says something out of line. + 

Acknowledgements. + 

This book would not have been possible without my son Brandon's help. + 

Brandon has been involved in helping me shape and create these ideas since I first began teaching at Georgetown University. + 

He was initially just there to video record the classes, but he also provided me feedback on how it was going and what was working. + 

To be fair, he actually has been negotiating with me since he was 2 years old. + 

I think I've known that ever since I found out he was using empathy to get out of trouble with his vice principal in high school. + 

In my first meeting with my brilliant coowwriter, Tall Roz, Brandon was there to keep the information flow going as Tall soaked it up. + 

In the first progress conference call with my amazing publisher, Hollis Heimbush, Hollis asked about Brandon's role, and Tall said having Brandon around was like having another Chris in the room. + 

Brandon has been indispensable. + 

Tall Roz is a flatout genius. + 

Anyone who writes a business book without him hasn't gotten as far as they could have. + 

It's that simple. + 

I can't believe how smart he is or how quickly he gets it. + 

He is a true businesswriting artist. + 

He's a great person as well. + 

Steve Ross, my agent, is a man of integrity and was perfect for this book. + 

He has great industry knowledge and made this book happen. + 

I am grateful to know him. + 

Hollis Heimbach rocks. + 

I am thrilled that she led the Harper Collins team and believed enough in this book to buy it. + 

Thank you, Hollis. + 

Thank you, Maya Stevenson, for coming on to the Black Swan team and holding us together. + 

We are going farther because of you. + 

Sheila Hen and John Richardson are two amazing people. + 

They are the ones who really paved the way to show that these hostage negotiation ideas belong in the business world. + 

Sheila was my teacher at Harvard Law School. + 

She inspired me with how she taught and who she is. + 

She asked me to teach alongside her two years later. + 

John asked me to teach international business negotiation at Harvard alongside him. + 

A year after that, he guided me through that process which led to the opportunity to become an adjunct at Georgetown. + 

when nothing was happening for me. + 

Both John and Sheila were there. + 

Without them, I don't know where I'd be. + 

Thank you both. + 

Gary Nosner was my mentor at the FBI. + 

He inspired and remade the hostage negotiation world. + 

With the help of his team at the Crisis Negotiation Unit, CNU, he supported me in whatever I wanted to do. + 

He made me the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator. + 

I could call Gary at 5:00 a.m. + 

and tell him I was getting on a plane in 3 hours to go to a kidnapping and he would say, "Go." His support never wavered. + 

At CNU, he pulled together the most talented collection of hostage negotiators ever assembled. + 

CNU hit its zenith when we were there. + 

None of us knew how lucky we were. + 

John Flood, Vince Dalonso, Chuck Regini, Winnie Miller, Manny Suarez, Dennis Braden, Neil Patell, and Steve Romano were all rock stars. + 

I learned from you all. + 

I can't believe what Chuck put up with from me as my partner. + 

Dennis was a mentor and great friend. + 

I constantly clashed with Vince and grew because of his talent. + 

All those who were on the FBI critical incident negotiation team during that time taught me as well. + 

Thank you. + 

Tommy Corrian and John Legori were my brothers when I was in New York City. + 

The three of us did extraordinary things together. + 

I am inspired by the memory of Tommy Corrian to this day. + 

I was privileged to be a member of the Joint Terrorist Task Force. + 

We fought evil. + 

Richie DeFalippo and Charlie Boddan were exceptional wingmen on the crisis negotiation team. + 

Thank you both for all you taught me. + 

Hugh McGawan and Bob Lden from the NYPD's hostage negotiation team shared their wisdom with me. + 

Both of you have been indispensable assets to the hostage negotiation world. + 

Thank you. + 

Derek Gaunt has been a great wingman in the Washington DC metropolitan area. + 

Derek gets it. + 

Thank you Derek. + 

Kathy Ellingsworth and her late husband Bill have been dear friends and a sounding board for years. + 

I am grateful for your support and friendship. + 

Tom Strrenz is the godfather of the FBI's hostage/crisis negotiation program and has been an unwavering friend. + 

I can't believe he still takes my calls. + 

My students at Georgetown and USC have constantly proved that these ideas work everywhere. + 

More than one student has stopped breathing when I looked at them and said, "I need a car in 60 seconds or she dies." Thanks for coming along for the ride. + 

Georgetown and USC have both been phenomenal places to teach. + 

Both are truly dedicated to higher learning, the highest academic standards, and the success of their students. + 

The hostages and their families who allowed me in during their darkest hours to try to help are all blessed people. + 

I am grateful to still be in touch with some of you today. + 

What wisdom there is in the universe that decided your paths were necessary. + 

I don't understand. + 

I was blessed by your grace. + 

I need all the help I can get. + 

Along the same lines, we want to produce a negotiation one sheet that summarizes the tools we are going to use. + 

It will have five short sections. + 

Section one, the goal. + 

Think through best worstc case scenarios, but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case. + 

Typically, negotiation experts will tell you to prepare by making a list. + 

Your bottom line, what you really want, how you're going to try to get there, and counters to your counterparts arguments. + 

But this typical preparation fails in many ways. + 

It's unimaginative and leads to the predictable bargaining dynamic of offer counter offer meet in the middle. + 

In other words, it gets results, but they're often mediocre. + 

The centerpiece of the traditional preparation dynamic and its greatest Achilles heel is something called the BATNA. + 

Roger Fischer and William Yuri coined the term in their 1981 bestseller, Getting to Yes. + 

And it stands for best alternative to a negotiated agreement. + 

Basically, it's the best possible option you have if negotiations fail, your last resort. + 

Say you're on a car lot trying to sell your old BMW 3 Series. + 

If you already have another dealer who's given you a written offer for $10,000, that's your BATNA. + 

The problem is that BATNA tricks negotiators into aiming low. + 

Researchers have found that humans have a limited capacity for keeping focus in complex stressful situations like negotiations. + 

And so once a negotiation is underway, we tend to gravitate toward the focus point that has the most psychological significance for us. + 

In that context, obsessing over a BATNA turns it into your target and thereby sets the upper limit of what you will ask for. + 

After you've spent hours on a BATNA, you mentally concede everything beyond it. + 

God knows aiming low is seductive. + 

Self-esteem is a huge factor in negotiation, and many people set modest goals to protect it. + 

It's easier to claim victory when you aim low. + 

That's why some negotiation experts say that many people who think they have win-win goals really have a wimpin mentality. + 

The wimpwin negotiator focuses on his or her bottom line and that's where they end up. + 

So if BATNA isn't your centerpiece, what should be? I tell my clients that as part of their preparation, they should think about the outcome extremes, best and worst. + 

If you've got both ends covered, you'll be ready for anything. + 

So know what you cannot accept and have an idea about the best case outcome. + 

But keep in mind that since there's information yet to be acquired from the other side, it's quite possible that best case might be even better than you know. + 

Remember, never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't take something better. + 

Once you've got flexibility in the forefront of your mind, you come into a negotiation with a winning mindset. + 

Let's say you're selling old speakers because you need $100 to put toward a new set. + 

If you concentrate on the $100 minimum, you'll relax when you hear that number, and that's what you'll get. + 

But if you know that they are for sale in used audio stores for $140, you could set a high-end goal of $150 while remaining open to better things. + 

Now, while I counsel thinking about a best/worst range to give my clients the security of some structure, when it comes to what actually goes on your one sheet, my advice is to just stick with the high-end goal, as it will motivate and focus your psychological powers, priming you to think you are facing a loss for any term that falls short. + 

Decades of goal setting research is clear that people who set specific, challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those who don't set goals or simply strive to do their best. + 

Bottom line, people who expect more and articulate it get more. + 

Here are the four steps for setting your goal. + 

Set an optimistic but reasonable goal and define it clearly. + 

Write it down. + 

Discuss your goal with a colleague. + 

This makes it harder to wimp out. + 

Carry the written goal into the negotiation. + 

Section two, summary. + 

Summarize and write out in just a couple of sentences the known facts that have led up to the negotiation. + 

You're going to have to have something to talk about beyond a self-serving assessment of what you want. + 

And you had better be ready to respond with tactical empathy to your counterparts arguments. + 

Unless they're incompetent, the other party will come prepared to argue an interpretation of the facts that favors them. + 

Get on the same page at the outset. + 

You have to clearly describe the lay of the land before you can think about acting in its confines. + 

Why are you there? What do you want? What do they want? Why? You must be able to summarize a situation in a way that your counterpart will respond with, "That's right." If they don't, you haven't done it right. + 

Section three, labels/acquusation audit. + 

Prepare three to five labels to perform an accusation audit. + 

Anticipate how your counterpart feels about these facts you've just summarized. + 

Make a concise list of any accusations they might make, no matter how unfair or ridiculous they might be. + 

Then turn each accusation into a list of no more than five labels. + 

and spend a little time role-playing it. + 

There are fill-in-the-blank labels that can be used in nearly every situation to extract information from your counterpart or diffuse an accusation. + 

It seems like blank is valuable to you. + 

It seems like you don't like blank. + 

It seems like you value blank. + 

It seems like blank makes it easier. + 

It seems like you're reluctant to blank. + 

As an example, if you're trying to renegotiate an apartment lease to allow sublets and you know the landlord is opposed to them, your prepared labels would be on the lines of, "It seems as though you're not a fan of subletters," or, "It seems like you want stability with your tenants." Section four, calibrated questions. + 

Prepare three to five calibrated questions to reveal value to you and your counterpart and identify and overcome potential dealers. + 

Effective negotiators look past their counterparts stated positions, what the party demands, and delve into their underlying motivations, what is making them want what they want. + 

Motivations are what they are worried about and what they hope for, even lust for. + 

Figuring out what the other party is worried about sounds simple, but our basic human expectations about negotiation often get in the way. + 

Most of us tend to assume that the needs of the other side conflict with our own. + 

We tend to limit our field of vision to our issues and problems and forget that the other side has its own unique issues based on its own unique worldview. + 

Great negotiators get past these blinders by being relentlessly curious about what is really motivating the other side. + 

Harry Potter author JK Rowling has a great quote that sums up this concept. + 

You must accept the reality of other people. + 

You think that reality is up for negotiation that we think it's whatever you say it is. + 

You must accept that we are as real as you are. + 

You must accept that you are not God. + 

There will be a small group of what and how questions that you will find yourself using in nearly every situation. + 

Here are a few of them. + 

What are we trying to accomplish? How is that worthwhile? What's the core issue here? How does that affect things? What's the biggest challenge you face? How does this fit into what the objective is? questions to identify behind the table dealillers. + 

When implementation happens by committee, the support of that committee is key. + 

You'll want to tailor your calibrated questions to identify and unearth the motivations of those behind the table, including how does this affect the rest of your team? How on board are the people not on this call? What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area? questions to identify and diffuse dealing issues. + 

Internal negotiating influence often sits with the people who are most comfortable with things as they are. + 

Change may make them look as if they haven't been doing their job. + 

Your dilemma in such a negotiation is how to make them look good in the face of that change. + 

You'll be tempted to concentrate on money, but put that aside for now. + 

A surprisingly high percentage of negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents. + 

Often they have more to do with self-esteem, status, autonomy, and other non-financial needs. + 

Think about their perceived losses. + 

Never forget that a loss stings at least twice as much as an equivalent gain. + 

For example, the guy across the table may be hesitating to install the new accounting system he needs and you are selling because he doesn't want to screw anything up before his annual review in 4 months time. + 

Instead of lowering your price, you can offer to help impress his boss and do it safely by promising to finish the installation in 90 days, guaranteed. + 

Questions to use to unearth the dealilling issues. + 

What are we up against here? What is the biggest challenge you face? How does making a deal with us affect things? What happens if you do nothing? What does doing nothing cost you? How does making this deal resonate with what your company prides itself on? It's often very effective to ask these in groups of two or three, as they are similar enough that they help your counterpart think about the same thing from different angles. + 

Every situation is unique, of course, but choosing the right mix of these questions will lead your counterpart to reveal information about what they want and need and simultaneously push them to see things from your point of view. + 

Be ready to execute follow-up labels to their answers to your calibrated questions. + 

Having labels prepared will allow you to quickly turn your counterparts responses back to them, which will keep them feeding you new and expanding information. + 

Again, these are fill-in-theblank labels that you can use quickly without tons of thought. + 

It seems like blank is important. + 

It seems you feel like my company is in a unique position to blank. + 

It seems like you are worried that blank. + 

Section five, non-cash offers. + 

Prepare a list of non-cash items possessed by your counterpart that would be valuable. + 

Ask yourself, what could they give that would almost get us to do it for free? Think of the anecdote I told a few chapters ago about my work for the lawyers association. + 

My counterparts interest was to pay me as little cash as possible in order to look good in front of his board. + 

We came upon the idea that they pay in part by publishing a cover story about me in their magazine. + 

That was low cost for them and it advanced my interests considerably. +
