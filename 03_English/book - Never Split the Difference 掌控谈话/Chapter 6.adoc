[.my2]
那就是它表面上的东西是多么少。

When that Monday ransom call came in to the politician's nephew, the guy was so petrified 吓呆的；僵化的 he could only think of doing one thing, paying the thugs 暴徒；恶棍。

Don't compromise 妥协；折衷。

[.my2]
不要妥协。

Let's go back to the $150,000 ransom demand.

[.my2]
让我们回到 15 万美元的赎金要求。

We're always taught to look for the win-win 双赢的 solution 解决方案；解决办法 to accommodate 迁就；适应, to be reasonable 合理的；讲道理的。

[.my2]
我们总是被教导要寻找双赢的解决方案，去迁就，去讲道理。

So, what's the win-win here? What's the compromise? The traditional 传统的；惯例的 negotiating logic 逻辑；道理 that's drilled into 灌输；训练 us from an early age, the kind that exalts 赞扬；歌颂 compromises, says, "Let's just split the difference 对半分；折中 and offer them $75,000." Then everyone's happy.

[.my2]
那么，这里的双赢是什么？妥协是什么？从很小的时候就灌输给我们的传统谈判逻辑，那种赞扬妥协的逻辑，会说：“我们不如对半分，给他们 75,000 美元吧。”然后每个人都开心了。

No.

[.my2]
不。

Just simply no.

[.my2]
就是不行。

The win-win mindset 心态；思维方式 pushed by 被…推动；由…提倡 so many negotiation experts 专家；行家 is usually ineffective 无效的；不起作用的 and often disastrous 灾难性的；极坏的。

[.my2]
许多谈判专家提倡的双赢心态通常是无效的，而且往往是灾难性的。

At best 充其量；最多, it satisfies 满足；使满意 neither side 任何一方都不。

[.my2]
充其量，它也不能满足任何一方。

And if you employ 采用；使用 it with a counterpart 对手；对应方 who has a win-lose approach 方式；方法, you're setting yourself up to be 使得自己处于…境地；准备好 swindled 欺骗；诈骗。

[.my2]
如果你对一个采用“赢-输”方式的对手使用它，你就是在让自己被欺骗。

Of course, as we've noted previously 先前；以前, you need to keep the cooperative 合作的；协作的, rapport-building 建立融洽关系的, empathetic 同情的；有同理心的 approach, the kind that creates a dynamic 动态；活力 in which deals 交易；协议 can be made, but you have to get rid of 摆脱；除掉 that naivee 天真；幼稚。

[.my2]
当然，正如我们先前指出的，你需要保持合作、建立融洽关系、有同理心的方式，这种方式能创造一种可以达成交易的动态，但你必须摆脱那种天真。

Because compromise, splitting the difference, can lead to 导致；造成 terrible outcomes.

[.my2]
因为妥协，对半分，可能会导致可怕的结果。

Compromise is often a bad deal and a key theme 关键主题；主要论点 will hit in this chapter is that no deal is better than a bad deal.

[.my2]
妥协通常是一个糟糕的交易，本章将要涉及的一个关键主题是，没有交易胜过糟糕的交易。

Even in a kidnapping, yes, a bad deal in a kidnapping is where someone pays and no one comes out 没有被释放；没有出来。

[.my2]
即使是在绑架案中，是的，绑架案中的糟糕交易是指有人付了钱，但没有人被释放。

To make my point 阐明观点；说明我的看法 on compromise, let me paint you an example 描绘；提供一个例子。

[.my2]
为了阐明我对妥协的看法，让我给你举一个例子。

A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit, but her husband doesn't want to.

[.my2]
一个女人想让她的丈夫穿黑色的鞋子搭配他的西装，但她的丈夫不想。

He prefers 偏爱；更喜欢 brown shoes.

[.my2]
他更喜欢棕色的鞋子。

So what do they do? They compromise.

[.my2]
那么他们怎么做？他们妥协了。

They meet halfway 妥协；折中。

[.my2]
他们折中。

And you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe.

[.my2]
你猜对了，他穿一只黑色和一只棕色的鞋子。

Is this the best outcome? No.

[.my2]
这是最好的结果吗？不是。

In fact, that's th the worst possible outcome.

[.my2]
事实上，这是最糟糕的结果。

Either of the two other outcomes, black or brown, would be better than the compromise.

[.my2]
其他两种结果中的任何一种，黑色或棕色，都会比妥协更好。

Next time you want to compromise, remind yourself of those mismatched 不搭配的；不协调的 shoes.

[.my2]
下次你想妥协时，提醒自己那些不搭配的鞋子。

So why are we so infatuated with 迷恋；痴迷于 the notion of compromise if it often leads to poor results? The real problem with compromise is that it has come to be known as this great concept in relationships, in politics and everything else.

[.my2]
既然妥协经常导致糟糕的结果，为什么我们如此迷恋妥协这个概念呢？妥协的真正问题在于，它在人际关系、政治和所有其他方面被认为是这样一个伟大的概念。

Compromise, we are told quite simply, is a sacred 神圣的；不可侵犯的 moral 道德的；伦理的 good 善行；益处。

[.my2]
简而言之，我们被告知，妥协是一种神圣的道德善行。

Think back to the ransom demand.

[.my2]
回想一下赎金要求。

Fair is no ransom, and what the nephew wants is to pay nothing.

[.my2]
公平就是没有赎金，而这个侄子想要的是不付任何钱。

So why is he going to offer $75,000, much less 更不用说；更别提 $150,000 for the ransom? There is no validity 有效性；正当性 in the $150,000 request.

[.my2]
那么，他为什么要出价 75,000 美元，更不用说 150,000 美元的赎金呢？150,000 美元的要求根本没有正当性。

With any compromise, the nephew ends up with 最终得到；落得 a bizarrely 离奇地；古怪地 bad result.

[.my2]
无论进行任何妥协，这个侄子最终都会落得一个离奇糟糕的结果。

I'm here to call on 呼吁；号召 compromise right now.

[.my2]
我在这里呼吁立即对妥协提出质疑。

We don't compromise because it's right.

[.my2]
我们妥协不是因为它正确。

We compromise because it is easy and because it saves face 保住面子；挽回面子。

[.my2]
我们妥协是因为它容易，而且因为它能保住面子。

We compromise in order to 为了；以便 say that at least we got half the pie 馅饼；（此处引申为）好处；利益。

[.my2]
我们妥协是为了说至少我们得到了一半的好处。

Distilled to its essence 提炼到其本质；归根结底, we compromise to be safe 安全的；保险的。

[.my2]
归根结底，我们妥协是为了安全。

Most people in a negotiation are driven by fear 恐惧；害怕 or by the desire 渴望；欲望 to avoid pain 痛苦；疼痛。

[.my2]
谈判中的大多数人是被恐惧或避免痛苦的渴望所驱使。

Too few are driven by their actual goals.

[.my2]
很少有人是被他们的实际目标所驱使。

So don't settle 妥协；安顿下来。

[.my2]
所以不要妥协。

And here's a simple rule 规则；法则。

[.my2]
这是一个简单的法则。

Never split the difference.

[.my2]
永远不要对半分。

Creative 创造性的；有创意的 solutions are almost always preceded by 以…为先导；先于 some degree 程度；水平 of risk, annoyance 烦恼；麻烦, confusion 困惑；混乱, and conflict 冲突；矛盾。

[.my2]
创造性的解决方案几乎总是以某种程度的风险、烦恼、困惑和冲突为先导。

Accommodation 迁就；适应 and compromise produce 产生；制造 none of that.

[.my2]
迁就和妥协不会产生这些。

You've got to embrace 拥抱；欣然接受 the hard stuff 困难的事情；棘手的问题。

[.my2]
你必须欣然接受困难的事情。

That's where the great deals are, and that's what great negotiators do.

[.my2]
那才是达成伟大交易的地方，也是伟大谈判者所做的。

Deadlines 最后期限；截止日期 make time your ally 盟友；助手。

[.my2]
最后期限让时间成为你的盟友。

Time is one of the most crucial 至关重要的；决定性的 variables 变量；可变因素 in any negotiation.

[.my2]
时间是任何谈判中最关键的变量之一。

The simple passing of time and its sharper cousin 更犀利的近亲；更尖锐的同类, the deadline, are the screw 螺丝钉；（此指）压力 that pressures 施压；迫使 every deal to a conclusion 结论；结束。

[.my2]
时间的简单流逝及其更尖锐的同类——最后期限，是迫使每笔交易达成结论的压力。

Whether your deadline is real and absolute 绝对的；完全的 or merely 仅仅；只不过 a line in the sand 划定的界限；象征性的限制, it can trick 欺骗；哄骗 you into believing that doing a deal now is more important than getting a good deal.

[.my2]
无论你的最后期限是真实且绝对的，还是仅仅是划定的界限，它都会欺骗你，让你相信现在达成交易比达成一笔好交易更重要。

Deadlines regularly 定期地；经常地 make people say and do impulsive 冲动的；易冲动的 things that are against their best interests 最佳利益；最大好处。

[.my2]
最后期限经常使人们说出和做出违背自己最佳利益的冲动行为。

Because we all have a natural tendency 自然倾向；天性 to rush 冲；赶 as a deadline approaches 接近；临近。

[.my2]
因为当最后期限临近时，我们都有赶时间的自然倾向。

What good negotiators do is force themselves to resist 抵抗；忍住 this urge 冲动；欲望 and take advantage of 利用；占…便宜 it in others.

[.my2]
优秀的谈判者所做的，是强迫自己抵抗这种冲动，并利用别人的这种冲动。

It's not so easy.

[.my2]
这没那么容易。

Ask yourself, what is it about a deadline that causes pressure and anxiety 焦虑；担忧? The answer is consequences 后果；结果。

[.my2]
问问自己，最后期限的什么特质会导致压力和焦虑？答案是后果。

The perception 感知；察觉 of the loss will incur 招致；遭受 in the future.

[.my2]
对未来将遭受的损失的感知。

The deal is off 交易取消；交易告吹。

[.my2]
“交易告吹了。”

Our mind screams at us 大喊大叫；尖叫 in some imaginary 想象的；虚构的 future scenario 场景；设想。

[.my2]
在某种虚构的未来场景中，我们的头脑向我们尖叫。

Should no resolution 解决；决议 be achieved by a certain point in time 某个时间点；特定时间? When you allow the variable of time to trigger 触发；引起 such thinking, you have taken yourself hostage 人质；劫持, creating an environment of reactive 反应性的；被动的 behaviors and poor choices where your counterpart can now kick back 放松；休息 and let an imaginary deadline and your reaction to it do all the work for him.

[.my2]
如果在某个特定时间点未能达成任何解决方案怎么办？当你允许时间这个变量触发这种想法时，你就把自己劫持为人质，创造了一个充满被动行为和糟糕选择的环境，而你的对手现在可以放松下来，让一个想象中的最后期限和你对它的反应为他完成所有的工作。

Yes, I use the word imaginary 想象的；虚构的。

[.my2]
是的，我用了“想象的”这个词。

In all the years I've been doing work in the private sector 私营部门；私人机构, I've made it a point to 致力于；养成习惯 ask nearly every entrepreneur 企业家；创业者 and executive 高管；行政主管 I've worked with whether over the course of 在…期间；在…过程中 their entire careers 职业生涯, they have ever been a witness 证人；目击者 to or a party of 参与者；当事人 a negotiation in which a missed deadline had negative repercussions 负面影响；反响。

[.my2]
在我从事私营部门工作的这些年里，我一直致力于询问我合作过的几乎每一位企业家和高管，在他们的整个职业生涯中，他们是否曾目睹或参与过一次错过了最后期限而产生了负面影响的谈判。

Among hundreds of such clients, there's one single solitary 唯一的；孤独的 gentleman 绅士；先生 who gave the question serious consideration 认真考虑；慎重考虑 and responded affirmatively 肯定地；同意地。

[.my2]
在数百位这样的客户中，只有一位唯一的绅士认真考虑了这个问题并给予了肯定回答。

Deadlines are often arbitrary 任意的；武断的, almost always flexible 灵活的；可变动的, and hardly ever 几乎从不；很少 trigger the consequences we think or are told they will.

[.my2]
最后期限通常是武断的，几乎总是灵活的，并且很少会触发我们认为或被告知会发生的后果。

Deadlines are the bogeymen 妖怪；吓人的东西 of negotiation, almost exclusively 独有地；仅仅 self-inflicted 自找的；自己造成的 figments 虚构的事物；想象的事物 of our imagination 想象力；幻想, unnecessarily 不必要地 unsettling 令人不安的；使心神不宁 us for no good reason 毫无理由；没有好的原因。

[.my2]
最后期限是谈判中的妖怪，几乎完全是我们自己造成的、想象力的产物，毫无理由地不必要地使我们心神不宁。

The mantra 口头禅；颂歌 we coach 教导；训练 our clients on is no deal is better than a bad deal.

[.my2]
我们教导客户的口头禅是，没有交易胜过糟糕的交易。

If that mantra can truly be internalized 内化；吸收 and clients begin to believe they've got all the time they need to conduct 进行；实施 the negotiation right, their patience 耐心；忍耐 becomes a formidable 强大的；可怕的 weapon 武器；手段。

[.my2]
如果这种口头禅能够真正被内化，并且客户开始相信他们有所有需要的时间来正确地进行谈判，他们的耐心就会成为一种强大的武器。

A few weeks after the Haitian kidnapping boom 激增；繁荣 began, we started to notice two patterns 模式；规律。

[.my2]
在海地绑架激增开始几周后，我们开始注意到两种模式。

First, Mondays seemed to be especially busy, as if the kidnappers had a particularly strong work ethic 职业道德；工作伦理 and wanted to get a jump on 抢先；先于 the week.

[.my2]
首先，星期一似乎特别忙，就好像绑架者有着特别强烈的职业道德，想抢先开始这一周。

And second, the thugs grew increasingly eager 渴望的；热切的 to get paid as the weekend approached.

[.my2]
其次，随着周末临近，那些暴徒变得越来越渴望拿到钱。

At first, this didn't make any sense。

[.my2]
起初，这毫无道理。

But by listening closely to 仔细听；密切关注 the kidnappers and debriefing 听取报告；询问 the hostages we rescued, we discovered something that should have been obvious 明显的；显而易见的。

[.my2]
但通过仔细倾听绑架者并听取我们解救的人质的报告，我们发现了一些本应显而易见的事情。

These crimes 犯罪；罪行 weren't politically 政治上地 motivated 激发的；有动机的 at all 根本；全然。

[.my2]
这些罪行根本不是出于政治动机。

Instead, these guys were garden variety 普通的；一般的 thugs 暴徒；恶棍 who wanted to get paid by Friday so they could party through the weekend.

[.my2]
相反，这些人是普通的暴徒，他们想在星期五之前拿到钱，这样他们就可以狂欢整个周末。

Once we understood the pattern 模式；规律 and knew the kidnapper's self-imposed 自己强加的；自定的 deadline 最后期限；截止日期, we had two key pieces of information that totally shifted 转移；改变 the leverage 影响力；优势 to our side.

[.my2]
一旦我们理解了这种模式并知道了绑架者自己设定的最后期限，我们手中就有两个关键信息，完全将优势转移到了我们这边。

First, if we let the pressure build 压力增大；积聚 by stalling 拖延；阻碍 the negotiations until Thursday or Friday, we could cut the best deal 达成最好的交易。

[.my2]
首先，如果我们通过将谈判拖延到周四或周五来让压力积聚，我们就能达成最好的交易。

And second, because you didn't need anything close to 接近；几乎 $150,000 to have a good weekend in Haiti, offering a lot lot less would suffice 足够；满足要求。

[.my2]
其次，因为在海地度过一个愉快的周末根本不需要接近 15 万美元，所以提供少得多就足够了。

How close we were getting to their self-imposed deadline would be indicated 表明；指示 by how specific 具体的；明确的 the threats 威胁；恐吓 were that they issued 发出；发布。

[.my2]
我们离他们自己设定的最后期限有多近，将由他们发出的威胁有多具体来表明。

Give us the money or your aunt is going to die is an early stage 早期；初级阶段 threat as the time isn't specified 明确规定；具体说明。

[.my2]
“给我们钱，否则你的姑妈就会死”是一个早期阶段的威胁，因为时间没有具体说明。

Increasing specificity on threats in any type of negotiations indicates 表明；暗示 getting closer to real consequences 实际后果；真实结果 at a real specified time。

[.my2]
任何类型的谈判中威胁的具体性增加，都表明离在实际具体时间发生的真实后果越来越近。

To gauge 测量；估计 the level of a particular threat, we'd pay attention to 关注；注意 how many of the four questions: what, who, when, and how, were addressed 处理；提及。

[.my2]
为了衡量某个特定威胁的级别，我们会关注其中“是什么、谁、何时、如何”这四个问题中有多少被提及。

When people issue threats, they consciously 有意识地；故意地 or subconsciously 潜意识地；不知不觉地 create ambiguities 模糊；歧义 and loopholes 漏洞；空子 they fully intend 打算；意欲 to exploit 利用；开发。

[.my2]
当人们发出威胁时，他们会有意或无意地制造模糊和漏洞，并完全打算利用这些漏洞。

As the loopholes started to close as the week progressed 进展；进行 and did so over and over again 反复地；一次又一次地 in similar ways with different kidnappings, the pattern emerged 出现；浮现。

[.my2]
随着一周的进展，漏洞开始缩小，并且在不同的绑架案中以类似的方式反复发生，这种模式就浮现了。

With this information in hand 手中；掌握, I came to expect 期望；预计 the kidnappings to be orderly 有秩序的；规律的 4-day events.

[.my2]
掌握了这些信息，我开始预计这些绑架案是有规律的 4 天事件。

It didn't make the abductions any more pleasant 令人愉快的；舒服的 for the victim, but it certainly 肯定；当然 made them more predictable 可预测的；可预见的 and a whole lot 很多；非常 cheaper 便宜的；廉价的 for the families on the other end 另一方；另一端。

[.my2]
这并没有让受害者感觉绑架事件更愉快，但它肯定使它们对另一端的家属来说更可预测，也便宜得多。

It's not just with hostage negotiations that deadlines can play into your hands 达到目标；对某人有利。

[.my2]
最后期限能让你占上风，不仅仅是在人质谈判中。

Car dealers 汽车经销商；汽车商 are prone to 易于；倾向于 give you the best price near the end of the month when their transactions 交易；业务 are assessed 评估；考核 and corporate 公司的；企业的 salespeople 推销员；业务员 work on a quarterly basis 每季度；按季 and are most vulnerable 易受攻击的；脆弱的 as the quarter comes to a close 结束；临近末尾。

[.my2]
汽车经销商倾向于在月底他们的交易被评估时给你最好的价格，而公司推销员按季度工作，在季度临近结束时最容易受到影响。

Now, knowing how negotiators use their counterparts deadlines to gain leverage 获得优势；取得影响力 would seem to suggest 建议；表明 that it's best to keep your own deadline secret 秘密的；隐秘的。

[.my2]
现在，知道谈判者如何利用对手的最后期限来获得优势，似乎表明最好将自己的最后期限保密。

And that's the advice you'll get from most old school 老派的；传统的 negotiation experts 专家；行家。

[.my2]
这就是你从大多数老派谈判专家那里得到的建议。

In his best-selling 畅销的；最畅销的 1980 book, You Can Negotiate Anything, one negotiation expert, Herb Cohen, tells the story of his first big business deal 商业交易；生意, when his company sent him to Japan to negotiate with a supplier 供应商；供货商。

[.my2]
在他 1980 年的畅销书《你可以谈判任何事情》中，一位谈判专家赫布·科恩讲述了他第一次大宗商业交易的故事，当时他的公司派他去日本与一家供应商谈判。

When he arrived, his counterparts asked him how long he was staying, and Cohen said a week.

[.my2]
当他到达时，他的对手问他要待多久，科恩说一周。

For the next 7 days, his hosts 东道主；主人 proceeded to entertain 招待；使…开心 him with parties, tours 旅游；观光, and outings 短途旅行；外出。

[.my2]
接下来的 7 天里，他的主人忙着以派对、旅游和短途旅行来招待他。

Everything but negotiation.

[.my2]
除了谈判之外的一切。

In fact, Cohen's counterparts didn't start serious 认真的；严肃的 talks until he was about to leave, and the two sides hammered out 敲定；达成 the deal's final details 细节；详情 in the car to the airport 机场。

[.my2]
事实上，科恩的对手直到他即将离开时才开始认真谈判，双方在去机场的车上敲定了交易的最终细节。

Cohen landed 降落；到达 in the United States with the sinking feeling 沉重的感觉；不好的预感 that he'd been played 被愚弄；被利用 and that he had conceded 让步；承认 too much under deadline pressure 最后期限的压力。

[.my2]
科恩回到美国时，有一种沉重的感觉，觉得他被愚弄了，并且在最后期限的压力下让步太多。

Would he have told them his deadline in retrospect 回想；回顾? No, Cohen says, because it gave them a tool 工具；手段 he didn't have.

[.my2]
回想起来，他是否应该告诉他们他的最后期限？科恩说，不，因为这给了他们一个他没有的工具。

They knew my deadline, but I didn't know theirs.

[.my2]
“他们知道我的最后期限，但我不知道他们的。”

That mentality 心态；思想状态 is everywhere these days.

[.my2]
这种心态如今随处可见。

Seeing a simple rule to follow and assuming 假设；认为 that a deadline is a strategic 战略性的；策略性的 weakness 弱点；劣势, most negotiators follow Cohen's advice and hide their drop deadad date 最终截止日期；确定的最后期限。

[.my2]
大多数谈判者认为最后期限是一个战略弱点，看到了一个简单的规则可以遵循，于是遵循科恩的建议，隐藏他们的最终截止日期。

Allow me to let you in on a little secret 透露一个秘密；告知一个秘密。

[.my2]
允许我透露一个小秘密。

Cohen and the herd 一群；（此指）追随者 of negotiation experts who follow his lead 跟随他的领导；追随他 are wrong.

[.my2]
科恩和追随他的那群谈判专家都错了。

Deadlines cut both ways 对双方都有影响；是双刃剑。

[.my2]
最后期限是一把双刃剑。

Cohen may well have 很有可能；很可能 been nervous about what his boss would say if he left Japan without an agreement 协议；同意。

[.my2]
科恩很可能对如果他没有达成协议就离开日本，他的老板会说什么感到紧张。

But it's also true that Cohen's counterparts wouldn't have won if he'd left without a deal.

[.my2]
但同样真实的是，如果他没有达成交易就离开了，科恩的对手也不会赢。

That's the key 关键；要点。

[.my2]
这就是关键。

When the negotiation is over for one side, it's over for the other, too.

[.my2]
当一方的谈判结束时，另一方的谈判也结束了。

In fact, Don A.

[.my2]
事实上，唐·A。

Moore, a professor at the Hos School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, says that hiding a deadline actually puts the negotiator in the worst possible position.

[.my2]
穆尔（Don A. Moore），加州大学伯克利分校哈斯商学院的教授，说隐藏最后期限实际上会让谈判者处于最糟糕的位置。

In his research, he's found that hiding your deadlines dramatically 显著地；极大地 increases the risk of an impass 僵局；僵持。

[.my2]
在他的研究中，他发现隐藏你的最后期限会显著增加陷入僵局的风险。

That's because having a deadline pushes you to speed up 加速；加快 your concessions 让步；迁就, but the other side, thinking that it has time, will just hold out for 坚持等待；坚守以求 more.

[.my2]
这是因为有最后期限会促使你加快让步，但对方认为自己还有时间，就会坚持要求更多。

Imagine if when NBA owners set a lockout 停工；停业 deadline during contract 契约；合同 negotiations, they didn't tell the players union 工会；联合会。

[.my2]
想象一下，如果 NBA 老板在合同谈判期间设定停工最后期限时，没有告诉球员联合会。

they would concede and concede as the deadline approached, inciting 煽动；刺激 the union to keep negotiating past 超过；越过 the secret deadline.

[.my2]
随着最后期限临近，他们会不断让步，这会刺激联合会继续谈判，超过秘密的最后期限。

In that sense 意义上；方面, hiding a deadline means you're negotiating with yourself, and you always lose when you do so.

[.my2]
从这个意义上说，隐藏最后期限意味着你在和自己谈判，当你这样做时，你总是会输。

Moore discovered that when negotiators tell their counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals.

[.my2]
穆尔发现，当谈判者告诉他们的对手他们的最后期限时，他们能得到更好的交易。

It's true.

[.my2]
这是真的。

First, by revealing 揭示；透露 your cutoff 截止日期；停止点, you reduce 减少；降低 the risk of impass.

[.my2]
首先，通过透露你的截止日期，你降低了僵局的风险。

And second, when an opponent 敌手；对手 knows your deadline, he'll get to the real deal 真正的交易；实质性的交易 and concession making 做出让步；让步 more quickly.

[.my2]
其次，当对手知道你的最后期限时，他会更快地达成真正的交易和做出让步。

I've got one final point to make before we move on.

[.my2]
在我们继续之前，我还有最后一点要说明。

Deadlines are almost never ironclad 坚固的；不可改变的。

[.my2]
最后期限几乎从来都不是不可改变的。

What's more important is engaging in 参与；从事 the process and having a feel for 对…有感觉；了解 how long that will take.

[.my2]
更重要的是参与这个过程，并了解这需要多长时间。

You may see that you have more to accomplish 完成；实现 than time will actually allow before the clock runs out 时间耗尽；时间用完。

[.my2]
你可能会发现你有更多的事情要完成，而时间在耗尽之前实际上不允许。

No such thing as 根本没有；不存在 fair 公平；公正。

[.my2]
根本不存在公平。

In the third week of my negotiations class, we play my favorite type of game.

[.my2]
在我的谈判课的第三周，我们玩我最喜欢的那种游戏。

That is the kind that shows my students how much they don't understand themselves.

[.my2]
那就是那种向我的学生展示他们对自己有多不了解的游戏。

I know I'm cruel 残酷的；残忍的。

[.my2]
我知道我很残忍。

It's called the ultimatum game 最后通牒游戏。

[.my2]
它被称为“最后通牒游戏”。

And it goes like this 如下；是这样。

[.my2]
它就像这样进行。

After the students split into pairs 成对分开；分成两组 of a proposer 提议者；建议人 and an acceptor 接受者；承兑人, I give each proposer $10.

[.my2]
学生们分成提议者和接受者两组后，我给每个提议者 10 美元。

The proposer then has to offer the accepter a round number 整数；大约的数字 of dollars.

[.my2]
然后提议者必须向接受者提供一个整数金额的美元。

If the acceptor agrees, he or she receives what's been offered and the proposer gets the rest.

[.my2]
如果接受者同意，他或她就会得到所提供的金额，而提议者得到剩下的。

If the acceptor refuses 拒绝；不接受 the offer though, they both get nothing and the $10 goes back to me.

[.my2]
但是，如果接受者拒绝了提议，他们都会一无所有，10 美元归还给我。

Whether they win and keep the money or lose and have to give it back is irrelevant 不相关的；不重要的 except to my wallet 钱包；皮夹。

[.my2]
他们是赢了保留钱还是输了必须归还，除了对我的钱包来说，都是不相关的。

What's important is the offer they make.

[.my2]
重要的是他们提出的提议。

The truly shocking 令人震惊的；令人吃惊的 thing is that almost without exception 几乎毫无例外, whatever selection 选择；挑选 anyone makes, they find themselves in a minority 少数；少数民族。

[.my2]
真正令人震惊的是，几乎毫无例外，无论任何人做出什么选择，他们都会发现自己处于少数。

No matter whether they chose $6, $4, $5, $5, $7, $3, $8, $2, etc., they look around and are inevitably 不可避免地；必然地 surprised to find no split 分割；分摊 was chosen far more than 远多于；大大超过 any other.

[.my2]
无论他们选择 $6/$4、$5/$5、$7/$3、$8/$2 等等，他们环顾四周，不可避免地惊讶地发现，没有一种分配方式比其他任何方式被选择的次数多得多。

In something as simple as merely splitting $10 of found money 偶然获得的钱；发现的钱, there is no consensus 共识；一致意见 of what constitutes 构成；组成 a fair or rational 理性的；合理的 split。

[.my2]
在像仅仅分割 10 美元的偶然获得的钱这样简单的事情上，对于什么构成一个公平或合理的分配，并没有共识。

After we run this little experiment 实验；试验, I stand up in front of the class and make a point 阐明观点；指出 that they don't like to hear.

[.my2]
在我们进行完这个小实验后，我站到教室前面，提出了一个他们不喜欢听的观点。

The reasoning 推理；论证 each and every student used was 100% irrational 非理性的；不合理的 and emotional 情感的；情绪化的。

[.my2]
每个学生所使用的推理是 100% 非理性和情绪化的。

What they say, I made a rational decision.

[.my2]
他们会说，“我做了一个理性的决定。”

Then I lay out 阐述；铺开 how they're wrong.

[.my2]
然后我阐述他们错在哪里。

first.

[.my2]
首先。

How could they all be using reason 理性；道理 if so many have made different offers? That's the point 关键；要点。

[.my2]
如果这么多人提出了不同的提议，他们怎么可能都在使用理性呢？这就是关键。

They didn't.

[.my2]
他们没有。

They assumed 假设；认为 the other guy would reason just like them.

[.my2]
他们假设对方会像他们一样推理。

If you approach 接近；处理 a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong.

[.my2]
如果你在处理谈判时认为对方和你想法一样，那你就错了。

I say that's not empathy 同理心；共情。

[.my2]
我说那不是同理心。

That's projection 投射；预测。

[.my2]
那是投射。

And then I push it even further 更进一步；推得更远。

[.my2]
然后我更进一步。

Why? I ask.

[.my2]
“为什么？”我问。

Did none of the proposers offer $1, which is the best rational offer for them and logically 逻辑上；合理地 unrejectable 不可拒绝的 for the acceptor? And if they did and they got rejected, which happens, why did the accepter turn them down 拒绝；回绝? Anyone who made any offer other than $1 made an emotional choice, I say.

[.my2]
“难道没有提议者提议 1 美元吗？这对他们来说是最好的理性提议，对接受者来说逻辑上是不可拒绝的。如果有人提了并被拒绝了（这种情况确实发生），为什么接受者会拒绝他们？任何提出不是 1 美元提议的人都做出了情绪化的选择，”我说。

And for you aced $1, since when 自从何时；什么时候 is getting zero better than getting $1? Did the rules of finance 金融；财政 suddenly change? This rocks 使…动摇；震撼 my students view of themselves as rational actors 理性的行为者；理性人, but they're not.

[.my2]
“而对于那些接受 1 美元的人来说，什么时候得到零比得到 1 美元要好？金融规则突然改变了吗？”这动摇了我的学生将自己视为理性人的看法，但他们不是。

None of us are.

[.my2]
我们都不是。

We're all irrational, all emotional.

[.my2]
我们都是非理性的，都是情绪化的。

Emotion is a necessary element 要素；组成部分 to decision-m that we ignore 忽视；不理会 at our own peril 自担风险；处于危险之中。

[.my2]
情感是决策的必要要素，我们忽视它将自担风险。

Realizing that hits people hard between the eyes 震惊；使人惊醒。

[.my2]
意识到这一点会使人感到震惊。

In on daycart's error, emotion, reason, and the human brain, neuroscientist 神经科学家 Antonio Damasio explained a groundbreaking 突破性的；开创性的 discovery 发现；发觉 he made.

[.my2]
在《笛卡尔的错误：情感、理性和人类大脑》一书中，神经科学家安东尼奥·达马西奥解释了他所做的一项开创性发现。

Studying people who had damage 损害；破坏 in the part of the brain where emotions are generated 产生；生成, he found that they all had something peculiar 独特的；奇怪的 in common 共同地；共同点。

[.my2]
在研究大脑中产生情感的区域受到损害的人时，他发现他们都有一些奇怪的共同点。

They couldn't make decisions.

[.my2]
他们无法做决定。

They could describe 描述；形容 what they should do in logical terms 逻辑术语；逻辑方面, but they found it impossible to make even the simplest choice.

[.my2]
他们可以用逻辑术语来描述他们应该做什么，但他们发现连最简单的选择都无法做出。

In other words, while we may use logic to reason ourselves toward 引导自己走向；推导出 a decision, the actual decisionmaking is governed by 受…支配；受…控制 emotion.

[.my2]
换句话说，虽然我们可能使用逻辑来推导出决定，但实际的决策是由情感支配的。

The F-word, why it's so powerful, when to use it, and how.

[.my2]
“F 词”（公平），为什么它如此强大，何时以及如何使用它。

The most powerful word in negotiations is fair.

[.my2]
谈判中最强大的词是公平（fair）。

As human beings, we're mightily 极大地；有力地 swayed by 被…影响；被…说服 how much we feel we have been respected 尊重；尊敬。

[.my2]
作为人类，我们极大地受到我们觉得自己受到多少尊重的影响。

People comply with 遵从；遵守 agreements 协议；协定 if they feel they've been treated 对待；处理 fairly and lash out 猛烈抨击；发怒 if they don't.

[.my2]
如果人们觉得自己受到了公平对待，他们就会遵守协议；如果他们觉得自己没有，他们就会发怒。

A decade 十年；十年期间 of brain imaging 脑成像 studies has shown that human neural activity 神经活动；神经元活动, particularly 尤其；特别 in the emotion regulating 调节；管理 insular cortex 岛叶皮层；脑岛皮层, reflects 反映；显示 the degree 程度；等级 of unfairness 不公平；不公正 in social interactions 社会交往；社交。

[.my2]
十年的脑成像研究表明，人类的神经活动，尤其是在调节情感的岛叶皮层，反映了社会交往中不公平的程度。

Even nonhuman primates 非人灵长类动物 are hardwired to 固有地；天生就 reject 拒绝；不接受 unfairness.

[.my2]
甚至非人灵长类动物也天生就会拒绝不公平。

In one famous study, two capacin monkeys 卷尾猴 were set to perform 执行；进行 the same task 任务；工作, but one was rewarded 奖励；回报 with sweet grapes 葡萄；葡萄藤 while the other received cucumbers 黄瓜；胡瓜。

[.my2]
在一个著名的研究中，两只卷尾猴被安排执行相同的任务，但一只得到了甜葡萄作为奖励，而另一只得到了黄瓜。

In response to 作为回应；针对 such blatant 公然的；赤裸裸的 unfairness, the cucumber-fed monkey literally 确实地；简直 went bananas 发疯；勃然大怒。

[.my2]
针对这种公然的不公平，那只吃黄瓜的猴子简直勃然大怒。

In the ultimatum game, years of experience has shown me that most acceptors will invariably 总是；不变地 reject any offer that is less than 少于；低于 half of the proposer's money.

[.my2]
在最后通牒游戏中，多年的经验告诉我，大多数接受者总是会拒绝任何低于提议者一半金额的提议。

Once you get to a quarter 四分之一；季度 of the proposer's money, you can forget it 别想了；放弃吧 and the acptors are insulted 侮辱；冒犯。

[.my2]
一旦你达到提议者金额的四分之一，你就别想了，接受者会感到被冒犯。

Most people make an irrational choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers 从指缝溜走；错过机会 rather than to accept a derisory 可笑的；微不足道的 offer because the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs 超过；胜过 the positive rational value of the money.

[.my2]
大多数人做出非理性的选择，让美元从指缝溜走，而不是接受一个微不足道的提议，因为不公平的负面情感价值超过了金钱的正面理性价值。

This irrational 非理性的；不合理的 reaction 反应；回应 to unfairness 不公平；不公正 extends 延伸；扩大 all the way to 甚至达到；一直延伸到 serious 认真的；严肃的 economic 经济的；与经济有关的 deals 交易；协议。

[.my2]

Remember Robin Williams's great work as the voice of the genie 精灵；妖精 in Disney's Aladdin 阿拉丁? Because he wanted to leave something wonderful behind for his kids.

[.my2]
还记得罗宾·威廉姆斯为迪士尼电影《阿拉丁》中的精灵配音的伟大作品吗？因为他想为他的孩子们留下一些美好的东西。

He said he did the voice for a cut rate fee 打折费；优惠费用 of $75,000, far below his usual $8 million payday 发薪日；收入。

[.my2]
他说他以 75,000 美元的优惠价格完成了配音工作，远低于他通常 800 万美元的收入。

But then something happened.

[.my2]
但后来发生了一些事情。

The movie became a huge hit 大成功；大热门, raking in 赚取；搜集 $54 million, and Williams went ballistic 勃然大怒；发狂。

[.my2]
这部电影大获成功，赚了 5400 万美元，而威廉姆斯勃然大怒。

Now, look at this.

[.my2]
现在，看看这个。

With the ultimatum game 最后通牒游戏 in mind 记在心里；考虑到, Williams wasn't angry because of the money.

[.my2]
考虑到最后通牒游戏，威廉姆斯生气不是因为钱。

It was the perceived 感觉到的；认为的 unfairness that pissed him off 使某人非常生气；惹恼某人。

[.my2]
是感觉到的不公平惹恼了他。

He didn't complain about his contract 合同；契约 until Aladdin became a blockbuster 巨型炸弹；（此处引申为）轰动一时的巨片。

[.my2]
直到《阿拉丁》成为一部轰动一时的巨片后，他才开始抱怨他的合同。

The nation of Iran 伊朗这个国家 was not so lucky.

[.my2]
伊朗这个国家就没有那么幸运了。

In recent years, Iran has put up with 忍受；容忍 sanctions 制裁；处罚 that have cost 耗费；使花费 it well over 远超；大大超过 $100 billion dollar in foreign investment 外国投资；境外投资 and oil revenue 石油收入；石油税 in order to 为了；以便 defend a uranium 铀 enriching 浓缩；使富集 nuclear program 核计划；核项目 that can only meet 满足；达到 2% of its energy needs 能源需求。

[.my2]
近年来，伊朗忍受了使其损失远超 1000 亿美元外国投资和石油收入的制裁，以便捍卫一个只能满足其 2% 能源需求的铀浓缩核计划。

In other words, like the students who won't take a free $1 because the offer seems insulting 侮辱性的；冒犯人的, Iran has screwed itself out of 错失；使自己失去 its chief 主要的；首要的 source of income 收入来源；收益来源, oil and gas revenue, in order to pursue 追求；寻求 an energy project with little expected payoff 回报；收益。

[.my2]
换句话说，就像那些因为提议似乎带有侮辱性而拒绝接受免费 1 美元的学生一样，伊朗为了追求一个预期回报甚微的能源项目，错失了其主要的收入来源——石油和天然气收入。

Why? Again, fairness for Iran.

[.my2]
为什么？再次，是为了伊朗的公平。

It's not fair that the global powers 全球大国；世界强国 which together have several thousand nuclear weapons 核武器 should be able to decide if it can use nuclear energy.

[.my2]
拥有数千枚核武器的全球大国，却能够决定伊朗是否可以使用核能，这是不公平的。

And why Iran wonders is it considered 认为；以为 a pariah 贱民；被社会唾弃者 for enriching uranium when India and Pakistan which clandestinely 偷偷摸摸地；秘密地 acquired 获得；取得 nuclear weapons are accepted members of the international community 国际社会。

[.my2]
伊朗想知道，为什么它因为浓缩铀而被视为贱民，而秘密获得核武器的印度和巴基斯坦却是国际社会的公认成员。

In a TV interview 采访；访谈, former Iranian nuclear negotiator 核谈判代表 seeded Hussein Mousavian hit the nail on the head 说中要害；说得完全对。

[.my2]
在一次电视采访中，前伊朗核谈判代表赛义德·侯赛因·穆萨维安说中要害。

他说：“今天的核问题对伊朗人来说不是核问题。”

"It's defending 捍卫；保卫 their integrity 完整性；正直 as an independent 独立的；自主的 identity 身份；特性 against the pressure 压力；压迫 of the rest." "You may not trust Iran, but its moves are pretty clear evidence 证据；证明 that rejecting perceived unfairness, even at substantial 巨大的；大量的 cost, is a powerful motivation 动机；动力。

[.my2]
“这是在捍卫他们作为一个独立身份的完整性，反对其他国家的压力。”“你可能不信任伊朗，但它的举动是相当清楚的证据，表明拒绝感觉到的不公平，即使付出巨大代价，也是一个强大的动机。

Once you understand what a messy 混乱的；麻烦的, emotional, and destructive 破坏性的；毁灭性的 dynamic 动态；活力 fairness can be, you can see why fair is a tremendously 极大地；非常 powerful word that you need to use with care 小心地；谨慎地。

[.my2]
一旦你理解了公平可能是一种多么混乱、情绪化和破坏性的动态，你就能明白为什么“公平”是一个极其强大的词，你需要谨慎使用。

In fact, of the three ways that people drop 抛出；说出 this fbomb “F词”（此指“公平”）, only one is positive 积极的；肯定的。

[.my2]
事实上，人们说出这个“F 词”的三种方式中，只有一种是积极的。

The most common use is a judoike 柔道般的；巧妙利用对方力量的 defensive 防御性的；辩护性的 move 动作；举动 that destabilizes 破坏稳定；使动摇 the other side.

[.my2]
最常见的用法是一种柔道般的防御性动作，它会破坏对方的稳定。

This manipulation 操纵；控制 usually takes the form of 以…形式出现；采取…形式 something like, "We just want what's fair." Think back to 回想；回顾 the last time someone made this implicit 含蓄的；不言而喻的 accusation 控告；指责 of unfairness to you, and I bet 敢肯定；打赌 you'll have to admit 承认；认可 that it immediately 立即；马上 triggered 触发；引起 feelings of defensiveness 防御；防卫 and discomfort 不适；不安。

[.my2]
这种操纵通常采取类似于“我们只想要公平”的形式。回想一下上次有人对你做出这种含蓄的不公平指责，我敢肯定你不得不承认它立即引发了防御和不安的感觉。

These feelings are often subconscious 潜意识的；下意识的 and often lead to an irrational concession 让步；迁就。

[.my2]
这些感觉通常是潜意识的，并且经常导致非理性的让步。

A friend of mine was selling her Boston home in a bust market 不景气的市场；萧条的市场 a few years back.

[.my2]
几年前，我的一个朋友在一个不景气的市场中出售她在波士顿的房子。

The offer she got was much lower than she wanted.

[.my2]
她得到的报价比她想要的低得多。

It meant a big loss for her and out of frustration 挫败；沮丧, she dropped this fbomb on the prospective 潜在的；未来的 buyer 购买者；买家。

[.my2]
这对她来说意味着巨大的损失，出于沮丧，她对潜在买家抛出了这个“F 词”。

"We just want what's fair," she said.

[.my2]
她说：“我们只想要公平。”

Emotionally rattled 情绪激动；心烦意乱 by the implicit accusation, the guy raised his offer immediately.

[.my2]
这个人被含蓄的指责搞得情绪激动，立即提高了他的报价。

"If you are on the business end of 处于接受端；是接受者 this accusation, you need to realize 意识到；明白 that the other side might not be trying to pick your pocket 偷某人的钱包；占某人便宜 like my friend.

[.my2]
“如果你是这种指责的接受者，你需要意识到对方可能不像我的朋友那样试图占你便宜。

They might just be overwhelmed by 被…压倒；应接不暇 circumstance 环境；情况。

[.my2]
他们可能只是被环境所压倒。

The best response either way is to take a deep breath 深呼吸 and restrain 抑制；克制 your desire to concede 让步；退让。

[.my2]
无论哪种情况，最好的回应都是深呼吸，克制你让步的欲望。

Then say, "Okay, I apologize 道歉；认错。

[.my2]
然后说：“好的，我道歉。

Let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we'll fix it 纠正；解决." The second use of the fbomb is more nefarious 邪恶的；恶毒的。

[.my2]
让我们停止一切，回到我开始不公平对待你的地方，我们会解决它。”“F 词”的第二种用法更为恶毒。

In this one, your counterpart will basically 基本上；大体上 accuse 指责；控告 you of being dense 愚笨的；迟钝的 or dishonest 不诚实的；欺骗性的 by saying, "We've given you a fair offer." It's a terrible little jab 刺拳；（此处引申为）小小的冒犯 meant to distract 转移；分散 your attention and manipulate 操纵；控制 you into giving in 让步；屈服。

[.my2]
在这种情况下，你的对手会基本上指责你愚笨或不诚实，说：“我们已经给了你一个公平的报价。”这是一个可怕的小小的冒犯，旨在分散你的注意力，并操纵你让步。

Whenever someone tries this on me, I think back to the last NFL lockout 停工；停止活动。

[.my2]
每当有人对我尝试这个方法时，我就会回想起上次 NFL（国家橄榄球联盟）的停工。

Negotiations were getting down to the wire 临近最后期限；处于关键时刻 and the NFL Players Association 协会；联合会, NFLPA, said that before they agreed to a final deal, they wanted the owners 老板；所有者 to open their books 公开账簿；公开财务。

[.my2]
谈判临近最后期限，NFL 球员协会（NFLPA）表示，在他们同意最终交易之前，他们希望老板们公开他们的账簿。

The owner's answer, "We've given the players a fair offer." Notice the horrible 可怕的；糟糕的 genius 天才；高明之处 of this.

[.my2]
老板们的回答是：“我们已经给了球员们一个公平的报价。”注意这其中的可怕的高明之处。

Instead of opening their books or declining 拒绝；婉拒 to do so, the owners shifted the focus 转移焦点；转移注意力 to the NFLPA's supposed 所谓的；假定的 lack of 缺乏；不足 understanding of fairness.

[.my2]
老板们没有公开账簿或拒绝这样做，而是将焦点转移到 NFLPA 所谓的对公平缺乏理解上。

If you find yourself in this situation, the best reaction is to simply mirror 反射；（此处指）模仿 the f that has just been lobbed at 投掷；扔向 you.

[.my2]
如果你发现自己处于这种情况，最好的反应是简单地模仿刚刚扔向你的那个“F 词”。

Fair, you'd respond, pausing 暂停；停顿 to let the words power do to them as it was intended 打算；意欲 to do to you.

[.my2]
“公平？”你会回应道，停顿一下，让这个词的力量对他们产生像它原本打算对你产生的影响。

Follow that with a label 标签；定性。

[.my2]
接着用一个“定性”（label）。

It seems like you're ready to provide 提供；供给 the evidence 证据；证明 that supports 支持；证实 that, which alludes to 暗指；暗示 opening their books or otherwise 用其他方式；以其他方法 handing over 移交；交给 information that will either 或者；要么 contradict 矛盾；反驳 their claim 声称；要求 to fairness or give you more data 数据；资料 to work with than you had previously.

[.my2]
“看来您准备好提供支持这一点的证据了，”这暗指公开他们的账簿，或者以其他方式移交信息，这些信息要么会反驳他们声称的公平性，要么会给你比以前更多的数据来处理。

Right away, you declaw 剪除爪子；去除威胁 the attack.

[.my2]
你立即消除了这个攻击的威胁。

The last use of the f-word is my favorite because it's positive and constructive 建设性的；积极的。

[.my2]
“F 词”的最后一种用法是我最喜欢的，因为它是积极且有建设性的。

It sets the stage for 为…做好准备；创造条件 honest and empathetic 善解人意的；有同理心的 negotiation.

[.my2]
它为诚实和善解人意的谈判创造了条件。

Here's how I use it.

[.my2]
我是这样使用的。

Early on in a negotiation, I say, "I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times 始终；一直。

[.my2]
在谈判的早期，我说：“我希望您始终觉得受到了公平对待。

So, please stop me at any time if you feel I'm being unfair, and we'll address 处理；应对 it.

[.my2]
所以，如果您觉得我不公平，请随时打断我，我们会处理它。

It's simple and clear and sets me up as an honest dealer 诚实的交易者；老实的商人." With that statement, I let people know it is okay to use that word with me if they use it honestly 诚实地；如实地。

[.my2]
这很简单明了，并让我树立了一个诚实商人的形象。”有了这句话，我让人们知道，如果他们诚实地使用“公平”这个词，就可以对我使用。

As a negotiator, you should strive for 努力争取；奋斗 for a reputation 名声；声誉 of being fair.

[.my2]
作为一名谈判者，你应该努力争取一个公平的声誉。

Your reputation precedes you 名声先于人；声誉在外。

[.my2]
你的声誉先于你。

[.my2]
几年前，我偶然发现了《如何成为一名“造雨人”》这本书，我喜欢偶尔回顾一下，以重温推动决策的情感驱动力。

The book does a great job to explain the sales job 销售工作；推销工作, not as a rational argument 理性论证；理性辩论, but as an emotional framing job 情感框架工作；情感定位工作。

[.my2]
这本书很好地解释了销售工作，不是作为一种理性论证，而是作为一种情感框架工作。

If you can get the other party to reveal 揭示；透露 their problems, pain, and unmet objectives 未达成的目标, if you can get at 领会；理解 what people are really buying, then you can sell them a vision 愿景；想象 of their problem that leaves your proposal 提议；建议 as the perfect solution 完美的解决方案。

[.my2]
如果你能让对方透露他们的问题、痛苦和未达成的目标，如果你能领会人们真正在购买什么，那么你就能向他们推销一个关于他们问题的愿景，使你的提议成为完美的解决方案。

Look at this from the most basic level 最基本层面；最基础的方面。

[.my2]
从最基本的层面来看待这个问题。

Let me give you an example.

[.my2]
让我给你举个例子。

I have this coffee mug 咖啡杯；马克杯, red and white with the Swiss flag 瑞士国旗。

[.my2]
我有这个咖啡杯，红白相间，带有瑞士国旗。

Let's say it's your mug now.

[.my2]
假设现在它是你的杯子。

You're going to sell it to me.

[.my2]
你要把它卖给我。

So tell me what it's worth 价值；值多少钱。

[.my2]
所以告诉我它值多少钱。

You're probably going to say something between five and $7.

[.my2]
你可能会说 5 到 7 美元之间。

In both cases, it was the exact same mug.

[.my2]
在这两种情况下，它是完全一样的杯子。

All I did was move the mug in relation to 与…相关；相对于 you, and I totally changed its value.

[.my2]
我所做的只是相对于你移动了这个杯子，我就完全改变了它的价值。

Or imagine that I offer you $20 to run a 3minute errand 跑腿；差事 and get me a cup of coffee.

[.my2]
或者想象一下，我给你 20 美元，让你跑 3 分钟的腿给我买杯咖啡。

You're going to think to yourself that $20 for 3 minutes is $400 an hour.

[.my2]
你会心想，3 分钟 20 美元就是每小时 400 美元。

You're going to be thrilled 非常兴奋的；非常激动的。

[.my2]
你会非常兴奋。

What if then you find out that by getting you to run that errand, I made a million dollar? You'd go from being ecstatic 狂喜的；欣喜若狂的 for making $400 an hour to being angry because you got ripped off 被骗；被宰。

[.my2]
如果后来你发现，通过让你跑这个腿，我赚了一百万美元呢？你会从赚了每小时 400 美元而欣喜若狂，变成因为被宰而生气。

The value of the $20, just like the value of the coffee mug, didn't change, but your perspective 看法；观点 of it did.

[.my2]
20 美元的价值，就像咖啡杯的价值一样，没有改变，但你对它的看法改变了。

I tell you that not to expose 揭露；暴露 our decision-making as emotional and irrational.

[.my2]
我告诉你这些不是为了揭露我们的决策是情绪化和非理性的。

We've already seen that.

[.my2]
我们已经看到了这一点。

What I am saying is that while our decisions may be largely 很大程度上；主要地 irrational, that doesn't mean there aren't consistent 一致的；一贯的 patterns, principles 原则；原理, and rules 规则；法则 behind how we act.

[.my2]
我要说的是，虽然我们的决定可能很大程度上是非理性的，但这并不意味着我们行为的背后没有一致的模式、原则和规则。

And once you know those mental 心理的；精神的 patterns, you start to see ways to influence 影响；支配 them.

[.my2]
一旦你知道那些心理模式，你就会开始看到影响它们的方法。

By far 迄今为止；到目前为止 the best theory 理论；学说 for describing the principles of our irrational decisions is something called prospect theory 前景理论 created in 1979 by the psychologists 心理学家 Daniel Conorman and Amos Ferski.

[.my2]
迄今为止，描述我们非理性决策原则的最佳理论，是一种叫做“前景理论”的东西，由心理学家丹尼尔·卡尼曼和阿莫斯·特沃斯基在 1979 年创立。

Prospect theory describes how people choose between options 选项；选择 that involve risk 风险；危险 like in a negotiation.

[.my2]
前景理论描述了人们如何在涉及风险的选项之间做出选择，就像在谈判中一样。

The theory argues 论证；主张 that people are drawn to 被…吸引；倾向于 sure things 确定的事情；稳妥的选择 over probabilities 可能性；几率 even when the probability is a better choice.

[.my2]
该理论主张，人们倾向于选择确定的事情而不是可能性，即使这种可能性是更好的选择。

That's called the certainty effect 确定性效应。

[.my2]
这被称为确定性效应。

And people will take greater risks to avoid losses 损失；失去 than to achieve gains 获得；收益。

[.my2]
人们会为了避免损失而承担更大的风险，而不是为了获得收益。

That's called loss aversion 损失厌恶；厌恶损失。

That's why people who statistically 统计上；从统计数据来看 have no need for insurance 保险；保障 buy it.

[.my2]
这就是为什么从统计数据来看不需要保险的人也会购买。

Or consider 考虑；认为 this.

[.my2]
或者考虑一下这个。

A person who's told he has a 95% chance of receiving $10,000 or 100% chance of getting $9,499 will usually avoid risk and take the 100% certain 确定的；肯定的 safe choice.

[.my2]
一个人被告知他有 95% 的机会获得 10,000 美元，或者 100% 的机会获得 9,499 美元，通常会避免风险，选择 100% 确定的安全选项。

While the same person who's told he has a 95% chance of losing $10,000 or 100% chance of losing $9,499 will make the opposite 相反的；对立的 choice.

[.my2]
而同一个人被告知他有 95% 的机会损失 10,000 美元，或者 100% 的机会损失 9,499 美元时，则会做出相反的选择。

[.my2]
在接下来的几页中，我将解释一些你可以用来对自己有利的前景理论策略。

But first, let me leave you with a crucial 至关重要的；决定性的 lesson 关于…的教训 about loss aversion 损失厌恶；厌恶损失。

[.my2]
但首先，让我给你留下一个关于损失厌恶的至关重要的教训。

In a tough negotiation, it's not enough to show the other party that you can deliver 交付；实现 the thing they want.

[.my2]
在一场艰难的谈判中，仅仅向对方展示你能提供他们想要的东西是不够的。

To get real leverage 影响力；优势, you have to persuade 说服；劝说 them that they have something concrete 具体的；实在的 to lose if the deal falls through 失败；告吹。

[.my2]
为了获得真正的优势，你必须说服他们，如果交易失败，他们将会有一些具体的东西会失去。

One, anchor 锚定；固定 their emotions 情感；情绪。

[.my2]
一、锚定他们的情绪。

To bend 扭曲；改变 your counterparts reality 现实；实际情况, you have to start with the basics of empathy 同理心；共情。

[.my2]
要扭曲你的对手的现实，你必须从同理心的基础开始。

So start out with an accusation audit 控诉审计；指责清查, acknowledging 承认；认可 all of their fears 恐惧；害怕。

[.my2]
所以，从一个控诉审计开始，承认他们所有的恐惧。

By anchoring their emotions in preparation for 准备；为…做准备 a loss, you inflame 激起；点燃 the other side's loss aversion so that they'll jump at the chance 抓住机会；迫不及待 to avoid it.

[.my2]
通过在为损失做准备的过程中锚定他们的情绪，你激起了对方的损失厌恶，这样他们就会抓住机会避免损失。

On my first consulting project 咨询项目；顾问项目 after leaving the FBI, I received the honor 荣幸；荣誉 to train 训练；培养 the national hostage negotiation team 人质谈判小组 for the United Arab Emirates 阿拉伯联合酋长国。

[.my2]
在我离开联邦调查局后的第一个咨询项目中，我很荣幸能为阿拉伯联合酋长国训练国家人质谈判小组。

Unfortunately, the prestige 威望；声望 of the assignment 任务；委派 was tempered 缓和；调节 during the project by problems with the general contractor 总承包商；主承包商。

[.my2]
不幸的是，这项任务的威望在项目期间被总承包商的问题所缓和。

I was a subcontractor 分包商；转包商。

[.my2]
我是一个分包商。

The problems became so bad that I was going to have to go back to the contractors 承包商；合同人 I'd signed up 签约；登记, who normally got $2,000 a day, and tell them that for several months, I could only offer $500.

[.my2]
问题变得如此糟糕，以至于我不得不回去找我签约的承包商们，他们通常每天得到 2,000 美元，我要告诉他们，在接下来的几个月里，我只能提供 500 美元。

I knew exactly what they would do if I just told them straight out 直截了当地；直接地。

[.my2]
我很清楚如果我直截了当地告诉他们，他们会做什么。

They'd laugh me out of town 嘲笑某人使…离开；赶走某人。

[.my2]
他们会把我嘲笑赶走。

So, I got each of them on the phone and hit them hard with 猛烈抨击；严厉对待 an accusation audit 控诉审计；指责清查。

[.my2]
于是，我给他们每个人打电话，用控诉审计猛烈抨击他们。

I got a lousy 糟糕的；差劲的 proposition 提议；建议 for you, I said and paused 暂停；停顿 until each asked me to go on 继续；进行。

[.my2]
“我有一个糟糕的提议给你，”我说，然后停顿了一下，直到每个人都让我继续说。

By the time we get off the phone, you're going to think I'm a lousy businessman 商人；生意人。

[.my2]
“等我们挂了电话，你会认为我是一个糟糕的商人。

[.my2]
他离开联邦调查局后的第一个大项目，他完全搞砸了。

He doesn't know how to run an operation 运营；操作。

[.my2]
他不知道如何运营一个项目。

And he might even have lied 撒谎；说谎 to me.

[.my2]
他甚至可能对我撒谎了。

And then once I'd anchored their emotions in a minefield 地雷区；（此指）充满危险的环境 of low expectations 低期望；低预期, I played on 利用；玩弄 their loss aversion 损失厌恶；厌恶损失。

[.my2]
然后，一旦我将他们的情绪锚定在一个低预期的雷区，我就利用了他们的损失厌恶。

Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity 机会；机遇 to you before I took it to someone else, I said.

[.my2]
“不过，我想在我把它给别人之前，把这个机会带给你们，”我说。

Suddenly, their call wasn't about being cut from 从…削减；从…减少 $2,000 to $500, but how not to lose $500 to some other guy.

[.my2]
突然间，他们电话的焦点不再是从 2,000 美元被削减到 500 美元，而是如何不把 500 美元输给其他人。

Every single one of them took the deal.

[.my2]
他们每一个人都接受了交易。

No counter offers 反提议；还价, no complaints 抱怨；投诉。

[.my2]
没有反提议，没有抱怨。

Now, if I hadn't anchored their emotions low, their perception 感知；看法 of $500 would have been totally different.

[.my2]
现在，如果我没有把他们的情绪锚定在低点，他们对 500 美元的看法就会完全不同。

If I just called and said, "I can give you $500 per day.

[.my2]
如果我只是打电话说：“我每天可以给你 500 美元。

What do you think?" They'd have taken it as an insult 侮辱；冒犯 and slammed down the phone 猛地挂断电话。

[.my2]
你觉得怎么样？”他们会认为这是一种侮辱，并猛地挂断电话。

Two, let the other guy go first most of the time.

[.my2]
二、大多数时候让对方先开口。

Now, it's clear that the benefits 好处；益处 of anchoring emotions are great when it comes to 谈到；涉及到 bending your counterparts reality, but going first is not necessarily 必然；不一定 the best thing when it comes to negotiating price.

[.my2]
现在，很明显，谈到改变你的对手的现实时，锚定情绪的好处是巨大的，但谈到协商价格时，先开口不一定是最好的事情。

When the famous film director 电影导演 Billy Wilder went to hire 雇用；聘请 the famous detective novelist 侦探小说家 Raymond Chandler to write the 1944 classic 经典作品；一流作品 Double Indemnity 双重赔偿, Chandler was new to Hollywood, but he came ready to negotiate 谈判；协商。

[.my2]
当著名的电影导演比利·怀尔德去雇佣著名的侦探小说家雷蒙德·钱德勒来撰写 1944 年的经典作品《双重赔偿》时，钱德勒是好莱坞的新人，但他已经准备好谈判了。

And in his meeting with Wilder and the movie's producer 制片人；制作人, Chandler made the first salary 薪水；工资 offer.

[.my2]
在他的与怀尔德和电影制片人的会面中，钱德勒提出了第一个薪水报价。

He bluffly 虚张声势地；大言不惭地 demanded 要求；需要 $150 per week and warned 警告；提醒 Wilder that it might take him 3 weeks to finish the project.

[.my2]
他虚张声势地要求每周 150 美元，并警告怀尔德，他可能需要 3 周才能完成这个项目。

Wilder and the producer could barely 几乎不；勉强 stop from laughing 忍住不笑；禁不住大笑 because they had been planning to pay Chandler $750 per week, and they knew that movie scripts 剧本；脚本 took months to write.

[.my2]
怀尔德和制片人几乎忍不住大笑，因为他们原本计划每周付给钱德勒 750 美元，而且他们知道电影剧本需要数月才能写完。

Lucky for Chandler, Wilder and the producer valued 重视；珍视 their relationship with Chandler more than a few hundred.

[.my2]
对钱德勒来说幸运的是，怀尔德和制片人重视与钱德勒的关系胜过几百美元。

So, they took pity on 对…表示同情；可怜 him and called an agent 代理人；经纪人 to represent 代表；代理 Chandler in the negotiations.

[.my2]
所以，他们可怜他，并叫来了一位经纪人来代表钱德勒进行谈判。

Similarly 类似地；同样地, I had a student named Jerry who royally 隆重地；（此指）彻底地 screwed up 搞砸；弄糟 his salary negotiation by going first.

[.my2]
类似地，我有一个名叫杰瑞的学生，他因为先开口而彻底搞砸了他的薪水谈判。

Let me say that this happened before he was my student.

[.my2]
让我说明一下，这发生在他成为我的学生之前。

In an interview at a New York financial firm 金融公司；金融机构, he demanded $110,000 in large part 很大程度上；主要地 because it represented 代表；象征 a 30% raise 加薪；提高。

[.my2]
在纽约一家金融公司的面试中，他要求 11 万美元，很大程度上是因为这代表了 30% 的加薪。

It was only after he started that the firm had started everybody else in his program at $125,000.

[.my2]
直到他开始工作后，他才知道该公司给他所在项目中的其他所有人都开出了 12.5 万美元的起薪。

That's why I suggest you let the other side anchor monetary 金钱的；财政的 negotiations.

[.my2]
这就是为什么我建议你让对方来锚定金钱谈判。

The real issue 问题；争论点 is that neither side has perfect information 完美信息；完全信息 going to the table.

[.my2]
真正的问题是，双方在谈判时都没有完美信息。

This often means you don't know enough to open with confidence 信心；自信。

[.my2]
这通常意味着你了解得不够多，无法自信地开始。

That's especially true anytime you don't know the market value 市场价值；市值 of what you are buying or selling, like with Jerry or Chandler.

[.my2]
尤其是在你不知道你买卖的东西的市场价值时，就像杰瑞或钱德勒的情况一样。

By letting them anchor, you also might get lucky.

[.my2]
通过让他们锚定，你也可能会走运。

I've experienced many negotiations when the other party's first offer was higher than the closing figure 最终数字；成交价 I had in mind 心里想；脑海中的。

[.my2]
我经历过许多谈判，对方的第一次报价比我心目中的成交价还要高。

If I'd gone first, they would have agreed and I would have left with either the winner's curse 赢家的诅咒 or buyer's remorse 购买者的懊悔；买了后悔。

[.my2]
如果我先开口，他们就会同意，而我就会带着赢家的诅咒或购买者的懊悔离开。

Those gut-wrenching 令人心痛的；令人痛苦的 feelings that you've overpaid 多付钱；支付过多 or undersold 贱卖；低价出售。

[.my2]
那些你多付了钱或贱卖了的令人心痛的感觉。

That said 话虽如此；尽管如此, you've got to be careful when you let the other guy anchor.

[.my2]
话虽如此，当你让对方锚定时，你必须小心。

You have to prepare yourself psychically 心理上；精神上 to withstand 承受；经受住 the first offer.

[.my2]
你必须在心理上做好承受第一次报价的准备。

If the other guy's a pro 专业人士；行家, a shark 鲨鱼；（此指）精明的行家, he's going to go for an extreme 极端的；极度的 anchor in order to bend your reality.

[.my2]
如果对方是专业人士，一个精明的行家，他会追求一个极端的锚定，以便扭曲你的现实。

Then when they come back with a merely absurd 荒谬的；不合理的 offer, it will seem reasonable 合理的；有道理的。

[.my2]
然后，当他们带着一个仅仅是荒谬的报价回来时，它就会显得合理了。

Just like an expensive $400 iPhone seems reasonable after they mark it down from 标低价格；降价出售 a crazy $600.

[.my2]
就像一个昂贵的 400 美元的 iPhone 在他们从疯狂的 600 美元降价后显得合理一样。

The tendency 倾向；趋势 to be anchored by extreme numbers is a psychological quirk 心理怪癖；心理上的小毛病 known as the anchor and adjustment effect 锚定和调整效应。

[.my2]
被极端数字锚定的倾向是一种被称为锚定和调整效应的心理怪癖。

Researchers 研究人员；调查者 have discovered that we tend to make adjustments 调整；校正 from our first reference points 参考点；参照点。

[.my2]
研究人员发现，我们倾向于从我们的第一个参考点进行调整。

For example, most people glimpsing 瞥见；一瞥 $8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ estimate 估计；估算 that it yields 产生；得出 a higher result than the same string 串；一连串 in reverse order 逆序；反向顺序。

[.my2]
例如，大多数人瞥见 $8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ 时，估计它得出的结果比逆序的同一串数字要高。

That's because we focus on the first numbers and extrapolate 推断；外推。

[.my2]
那是因为我们专注于最初的数字并进行推断。

That's not to say 并不是说；这不意味着 never open.

[.my2]
这并不是说永远不要先开口。

Rules like that are easy to remember, but like most simplistic 过于简化的；单纯化的 approaches 方法；途径, they are not always good advice 建议；忠告。

[.my2]
像那样的规则很容易记住，但就像大多数过于简单化的方法一样，它们并不总是好的建议。

If you're dealing with a rookie 菜鸟；新手 counterpart, you might be tempted 被诱惑；想要 to be the shark and throw out 提出；扔出 an extreme anchor.

[.my2]
如果你正在与一个新手对手打交道，你可能会想做那个精明的行家，抛出一个极端的锚定。

Or if you really know the market and you're dealing with an equally informed 消息灵通的；知情的 pro, you might offer a number just to make the negotiation go faster.

[.my2]
或者如果你真的了解市场，并且正在与一个同样消息灵通的专业人士打交道，你可能会提供一个数字，只是为了让谈判进行得更快。

Here's my personal advice on whether or not you want to be the shark that eats a rookie counterpart.

[.my2]
关于你是否想成为吃掉新手对手的精明行家，这是我的个人建议。

Just remember, your reputation precedes you 声誉在你之前；声名在外。

[.my2]
记住，你的声誉先于你。

I've run into 遇到；碰见 CEOs 首席执行官；总裁 whose reputation was to always badly beat 彻底击败；惨胜 their counterpart and pretty soon 很快；不久 no one would deal with them.

[.my2]
我遇到过一些首席执行官，他们的名声是总是彻底击败他们的对手，很快就没有人愿意和他们打交道了。

Three, establish 建立；确立 a range 范围；幅度。

[.my2]
三、确立一个范围。

While going first rarely 很少地；不常 helps, there is one way to seem to make an offer and bend their reality in the process 过程中；程序中。

[.my2]
虽然先开口很少有帮助，但有一种方法似乎可以在这个过程中提出一个报价并扭曲他们的现实。

That is by alluding to 暗指；暗示 a range.

[.my2]
那就是通过暗示一个范围。

What I mean is this.

[.my2]
我的意思是。

When confronted with 面对；遇到 naming your terms 条款；条件 or price, counter by 回击；反驳 recalling 回忆；想起 a similar deal, which establishes your ballpark 大致范围；大概范围, albeit 尽管；虽然 the best possible ballpark you wish to be in.

[.my2]
当面对说出你的条件或价格时，通过回忆一个类似的交易来回击，这确立了你的大致范围，尽管是你希望达到的最好的大致范围。

Instead of saying, "I'm worth $110,000," Jerry might have said, "At top places like XC Corp, people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000." That gets your point across 传达你的观点；让人理解 your point without moving the other party into a defensive position 防御态势；防守位置。

[.my2]
杰瑞没有说“我值 11 万美元”，他可能会说：“在像 XC 公司这样的顶尖公司，从事这份工作的人收入在 13 万到 17 万美元之间。”这可以在不让对方进入防御态势的情况下，传达你的观点。

and it gets him thinking at higher levels 更高层次。

[.my2]
并让他开始在更高层次上思考。

Research shows that people who hear extreme anchors unconsciously 无意识地；不知不觉地 adjust 调整；调节 their expectations in the direction of 朝…方向；往…方向 the opening number.

[.my2]
研究表明，听到极端锚定的人会无意识地朝开价数字的方向调整他们的期望。

Many even go directly to their price limit 价格限制；最高价。

[.my2]
许多人甚至直接达到了他们的价格限制。

If Jerry had given this range, the firm probably would have offered $130,000 because it looked so cheap next to 相比之下；在…旁边 $170,000.

[.my2]
如果杰瑞提供了这个范围，该公司很可能会提供 13 万美元，因为它与 17 万美元相比看起来很便宜。

In a recent study, four Colombia Business School psychologists found that job applicants 求职者；申请人 who named a range received significantly 显著地；非常 higher overall salaries 总薪水；总工资 than those who offered a number, especially if their range was a bolstering range 增强范围；支撑范围 in which the low number in the range was what they actually wanted.

[.my2]
在最近的一项研究中，四位哥伦比亚商学院的心理学家发现，说出一个范围的求职者比那些提供单个数字的求职者获得了显著更高的总薪水，特别是如果他们的范围是一个增强范围，即范围中的低数字是他们实际想要的。

Understand if you offer a range and it's a good idea to do so, expect them to come in at the low end 低端；下限。

[.my2]
要明白，如果你提供一个范围（这样做是个好主意），就要预期他们会从低端开始。

Four, pivot 转向；以…为中心 to non-monetary terms 非金钱条款；非货币条件。

[.my2]
四、转向非金钱条款。

People get hung up on 迷恋；纠结于 how much, but don't deal with numbers in isolation 孤立地；单独地。

[.my2]
人们纠结于多少钱，但不要孤立地处理数字。

That leads to bargaining 讨价还价；交易, a series of rigid 僵硬的；固定的 positions 立场；位置 defined by emotional views of fairness and pride 自尊；骄傲。

[.my2]
这导致了讨价还价，一系列由对公平和自尊的情绪化看法所定义的僵硬立场。

Negotiation is a more intricate 错综复杂的；复杂的 and subtle 微妙的；精细的 dynamic 动态；活力 than that.

[.my2]
谈判是一种比那更错综复杂和微妙的动态。

One of the easiest ways to bend your counterparts reality to your point of view 观点；看法 is by pivoting to non-monetary terms.

[.my2]
将你的对手的现实转向你的观点的最简单方法之一是转向非金钱条款。

After you've anchored them high, you can make your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren't important to you, but could be important to them.

[.my2]
在你将他们锚定在高点之后，你可以通过提供一些对你不重要但对他们可能重要的东西，让你的报价看起来合理。

Or if their offer is low, you could ask for things that matter to 对…重要；有关系 you more than them.

[.my2]
或者如果他们的报价很低，你可以要求一些对你比对他们更重要的东西。

Since this is sometimes difficult, what we often do is throw out examples 提出例子；举例 to start the brainstorming 脑力激荡；集思广益 process.

[.my2]
由于这有时很困难，我们经常做的是提出例子来启动集思广益的过程。

Not long ago, I did some training for the Memphis Bar Association 律师协会；律师公会。

[.my2]
不久前，我为孟菲斯律师协会做了一些培训。

[.my2]
但他们可以支付 5 万到 8.5 万美元之间。

But since learning that the ransom 赎金；赎金钱 was just party money, I was aiming much lower 目标低得多；旨在更低, $5,000.

[.my2]
没有成功条款的薪水条款就是俄罗斯轮盘赌。

[.my2]
在他最后一个学期，他通过向老板暗示，一旦他毕业，公司停止每年约 31,000 美元的 MBA 投资后，那笔钱应该作为薪水给他，从而设定了一个非特异性锚定，一种范围。

His boss made no commitment 承诺；保证, but Angel was pleasantly persistent about it, which set the idea as an anchor in his boss's mind.

[.my2]
他的老板没有做出承诺，但安赫尔对此愉快地坚持，这在老板的脑海中将这个想法设定为一个锚定。

Upon graduation 毕业；结业, Angel and his boss had their big sitdown 正式会议；坐下来谈。

[.my2]
毕业后，安赫尔和他的老板进行了一次正式会议。

In an assertive 坚定的；自信的 and calm 冷静的；镇静的 manner 方式；态度, Angel broached 提出；开始讨论 a non-financial issue 非财务问题；非金钱问题 to move the focus away from 转移注意力；避开 how much.

在那时，安赫尔和他的经理定义了他在新职位中的角色和职责，从而设定了成功指标。

Then Angel took a breath and paused so that his boss would be the first to throw out a number 抛出一个数字；提出一个报价。

[.my2]
然后安赫尔深吸一口气并停顿，这样他的老板就会是第一个抛出一个数字的人。

At last, he did.

[.my2]
终于，他抛出了。

Curiously enough 奇怪的是；出乎意料的是, the number showed that Angel's earlier efforts 努力；尝试 at anchoring had worked.

[.my2]
奇怪的是，这个数字显示安赫尔早期的锚定努力奏效了。

He proposed 提议；建议 to add $31,000 to Angel's base salary 基本工资；底薪, almost a 50% raise.

[.my2]
他提议给安赫尔的基本工资增加 31,000 美元，几乎是 50% 的加薪。

But Angel was no rookie negotiator 新手谈判者；菜鸟谈判者。

[.my2]
但安赫尔已经不再是新手谈判者了。

Not after taking my class.

[.my2]
在上完我的课之后就不是了。

So instead of countering 反驳；还价 and getting stuck in 陷入；困在 how much, he kept talking, labeling 贴标签；定性 the boss's emotions and empathizing with 对…感同身受；产生共情 his situation.

[.my2]
所以他没有还价并陷入“多少钱”的问题，而是继续说话，定性老板的情绪并对他的处境产生共情。

[.my2]
当时，公司正在经历与其投资者的艰难谈判。

This pause created a dynamic of pre-deline 预先划定的；预设的 urgency 紧迫感；急迫 in his boss, which Angel exploited 利用；开发 when he returned with the printout 打印件；印刷品。

[.my2]
这次停顿在老板身上创造了一种预设的紧迫感动态，安赫尔在带着打印件回来时利用了这种感觉。

On the bottom, he'd added his desired 期望的；想要的 compensation 报酬；薪酬, 134,5K, 143K.

[.my2]
在底部，他添加了他期望的薪酬：134.5K 到 143K。

In that one little move, Angel weaved together 编织在一起；巧妙地结合 a bunch of 一堆；大量 the lessons from this chapter.

[.my2]
在那一个小小的举动中，安赫尔巧妙地结合了本章的大量教训。

The odd numbers 奇数；不规则的数字 gave them the weight of 份量；重要性 thoughtful calculation 经过深思熟虑的计算。

[.my2]
奇数赋予了它们经过深思熟虑的计算的份量。

The numbers were high, too, which exploited his boss's natural tendency 天生倾向；自然趋势 to go directly to his price limit when faced by 面对；面临 an extreme anchor.

[.my2]
这些数字也很高，这利用了老板面对极端锚定时直接达到价格限制的天生倾向。

And they were a range 范围；幅度, which made Angel seem less aggressive 咄咄逼人的；有攻击性的。

[.my2]
而且它们是一个范围，这使得安赫尔看起来不那么咄咄逼人。

and the lower end 下限；低端 more reasonable in comparison 相比之下；对照。

[.my2]
相比之下，下限显得更合理。

From his boss's body language 肢体语言；身体语言, raised eyebrows 扬起的眉毛；惊讶的表情, it was clear that he was surprised by the compensation request 薪酬要求；报酬请求, but it had the desired effect 期望的效果；预期的作用。

[.my2]
从他老板的肢体语言（扬起的眉毛）来看，很明显他对薪酬要求感到惊讶，但它产生了预期的效果。

After some comments about the description, he countered with $120,000.

[.my2]
在对职位说明进行了一些评论之后，他反击以 12 万美元。

Angel didn't say no or yes, but kept talking and creating empathy.

[.my2]
安赫尔没有说“不”或“是”，而是继续说话并创造同理心。

Then in the middle of a sentence, seemingly 似乎；看来 out of the blue 突然地；出乎意料地, his boss threw out $127,000.

[.my2]
然后在一句话说到一半时，他的老板似乎是突然地抛出了 12.7 万美元。

With his boss obviously 明显地；显然地 negotiating with himself 与自己谈判；自言自语, Angel kept him going 让他继续；保持进行。

[.my2]
由于他的老板显然在与自己谈判，安赫尔让他继续进行。

[.my2]
最终，他的老板说他同意 134,500 美元，并将从 3 个月后开始支付该薪水，条件是得到董事会的批准。

As the icing on the cake 锦上添花；画龙点睛, Angel worked in 巧妙地加入；融入 a positive use of the word fair.

[.my2]
作为锦上添花，安赫尔巧妙地加入了对“公平”一词的积极使用。

That's fair, he said, and then sold the raise to his boss as a marriage 婚姻；结合 in which his boss would be the mentor.

[.my2]
“这很公平，”他说，然后将这次加薪推销给他的老板，比作一场婚姻，其中他的老板将是导师。

I'm asking you, not the board, for the promotion 升职；晋升, and all I need is for you to agree with it, he said.

[.my2]
“我是在向你，而不是向董事会，请求升职，我所需要的只是你同意，”他说。

And how did Angel's boss reply to his new ambassador? I'll fight to get you this salary.

[.my2]
安赫尔的老板是如何回复他的新大使的呢？“我会为你争取这笔薪水。”

So, follow Angel's lead 效仿某人；跟随某人 and make it rain 带来成功；创造财富。

[.my2]
所以，效仿安赫尔，创造财富吧。

We are emotional, irrational beasts 野兽；动物 who are emotional and irrational in predictable 可预测的；可预见的 pattern-filled ways 充满模式的方式；有规律的方式。

Bend their reality. + 

One Monday morning in Hades capital, Porta Prince, a call came in to the FBI office from the nephew of a prominent Haitian political figure. + 

He spoke so fast he had to repeat his story three times before I understood. + 

But finally, I got the basics. + 

Kidnappers had snatched his aunt from her car, and their ransom demand was $150,000. + 

"Give us the money," the kidnappers told him, or your aunt is going to die. + 

In the lawless, chaotic wake of the 2004 rebellion that toppled President Jean Bertrron Aristed, Haiti surpassed Colombia as the kidnapped capital of the Americas. + 

In fact, with between 8 and 10 people abducted every day in the Caribbean nation of 8 million, Haiti earned the dubious honor of having the highest kidnapping rate in the world. + 

During this onslaught of abductions and death threats, I was the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator, and I had never seen anything like it. + 

Reports of abductions, increasingly bold daylight attacks right in Porto, Prince seemed to roll into the office hourly. + 

14 students abducted on their school bus. + 

American missionary Philip Snyder shot in an ambush and seized along with a Haitian boy he was taking to Michigan for eye surgery. + 

Prominent Haitian politicians and businessmen bundled from their homes in broad daylight. + 

No one was spared. + 

Most of the abductions went down the same way. + 

Ski massclad kidnappers surrounded a house or a car, forced entry with a gun, and snatched a vulnerable victim, usually a woman, child, or elderly person. + 

Early on, there was the possibility that the kidnappings were driven by politically aligned gangs seeking to destabilize Hades new government. + 

This proved to be wrong. + 

Haitian criminals are famous for employing brutal means for political ends, but when it came to kidnappings, it was almost always all business. + 

Later on, I'll get to how we pieced together the clues to discover who the perpetrators were and what they really wanted. + 

Invaluable information when it came to negotiating with and destabilizing these gangs. + 

But first, I want to discuss the crystallizing feature of highstakes life and death negotiating. + 

that is how little of it is on the surface. + 

When that Monday ransom call came in to the politician's nephew, the guy was so petrified he could only think of doing one thing, paying the thugs. + 

His reaction makes sense. + 

When you get a call from brutal criminals who say they'll kill your aunt unless you pay them immediately, it seems impossible to find leverage in the situation. + 

So, you pay the ransom and they release your relative. + 

Right? Wrong. + 

There's always leverage. + 

Negotiation is never a linear formula. + 

Add X to Y to get Z. + 

We all have irrational blind spots, hidden needs, and undeveloped notions. + 

Once you understand that subterranean world of unspoken needs and thoughts, you'll discover a universe of variables that can be leveraged to change your counterparts needs and expectations. + 

From using some people's fear of deadlines and the mysterious power of odd numbers to our misunderstood relationship to fairness, there are always ways to bend our counterparts reality so it conforms to what we ultimately want to give them, not to what they initially think they deserve. + 

Don't compromise. + 

Let's go back to the $150,000 ransom demand. + 

We're always taught to look for the win-win solution to accommodate, to be reasonable. + 

So, what's the win-win here? What's the compromise? The traditional negotiating logic that's drilled into us from an early age, the kind that exalts compromises, says, "Let's just split the difference and offer them $75,000." Then everyone's happy. + 

No. + 

Just simply no. + 

The win-win mindset pushed by so many negotiation experts is usually ineffective and often disastrous. + 

At best, it satisfies neither side. + 

And if you employ it with a counterpart who has a win-lose approach, you're setting yourself up to be swindled. + 

Of course, as we've noted previously, you need to keep the cooperative, rapport-building, empathetic approach, the kind that creates a dynamic in which deals can be made, but you have to get rid of that naivee. + 

Because compromise, splitting the difference, can lead to terrible outcomes. + 

Compromise is often a bad deal and a key theme will hit in this chapter is that no deal is better than a bad deal. + 

Even in a kidnapping, yes, a bad deal in a kidnapping is where someone pays and no one comes out. + 

To make my point on compromise, let me paint you an example. + 

A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit, but her husband doesn't want to. + 

He prefers brown shoes. + 

So what do they do? They compromise. + 

They meet halfway. + 

And you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe. + 

Is this the best outcome? No. + 

In fact, that's th the worst possible outcome. + 

Either of the two other outcomes, black or brown, would be better than the compromise. + 

Next time you want to compromise, remind yourself of those mismatched shoes. + 

So why are we so infatuated with the notion of compromise if it often leads to poor results? The real problem with compromise is that it has come to be known as this great concept in relationships, in politics and everything else. + 

Compromise, we are told quite simply, is a sacred moral good. + 

Think back to the ransom demand. + 

Fair is no ransom, and what the nephew wants is to pay nothing. + 

So why is he going to offer $75,000, much less $150,000 for the ransom? There is no validity in the $150,000 request. + 

With any compromise, the nephew ends up with a bizarrely bad result. + 

I'm here to call on compromise right now. + 

We don't compromise because it's right. + 

We compromise because it is easy and because it saves face. + 

We compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie. + 

Distilled to its essence, we compromise to be safe. + 

Most people in a negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain. + 

Too few are driven by their actual goals. + 

So don't settle. + 

And here's a simple rule. + 

Never split the difference. + 

Creative solutions are almost always preceded by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict. + 

Accommodation and compromise produce none of that. + 

You've got to embrace the hard stuff. + 

That's where the great deals are, and that's what great negotiators do. + 

Deadlines make time your ally. + 

Time is one of the most crucial variables in any negotiation. + 

The simple passing of time and its sharper cousin, the deadline, are the screw that pressures every deal to a conclusion. + 

Whether your deadline is real and absolute or merely a line in the sand, it can trick you into believing that doing a deal now is more important than getting a good deal. + 

Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests. + 

Because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches. + 

What good negotiators do is force themselves to resist this urge and take advantage of it in others. + 

It's not so easy. + 

Ask yourself, what is it about a deadline that causes pressure and anxiety? The answer is consequences. + 

The perception of the loss will incur in the future. + 

The deal is off. + 

Our mind screams at us in some imaginary future scenario. + 

Should no resolution be achieved by a certain point in time? When you allow the variable of time to trigger such thinking, you have taken yourself hostage, creating an environment of reactive behaviors and poor choices where your counterpart can now kick back and let an imaginary deadline and your reaction to it do all the work for him. + 

Yes, I use the word imaginary. + 

In all the years I've been doing work in the private sector, I've made it a point to ask nearly every entrepreneur and executive I've worked with whether over the course of their entire careers, they have ever been a witness to or a party of a negotiation in which a missed deadline had negative repercussions. + 

Among hundreds of such clients, there's one single solitary gentleman who gave the question serious consideration and responded affirmatively. + 

Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think or are told they will. + 

Deadlines are the bogeymen of negotiation, almost exclusively self-inflicted figments of our imagination, unnecessarily unsettling us for no good reason. + 

The mantra we coach our clients on is no deal is better than a bad deal. + 

If that mantra can truly be internalized and clients begin to believe they've got all the time they need to conduct the negotiation right, their patience becomes a formidable weapon. + 

A few weeks after the Haitian kidnapping boom began, we started to notice two patterns. + 

First, Mondays seemed to be especially busy, as if the kidnappers had a particularly strong work ethic and wanted to get a jump on the week. + 

And second, the thugs grew increasingly eager to get paid as the weekend approached. + 

At first, this didn't make any sense. + 

But by listening closely to the kidnappers and debriefing the hostages we rescued, we discovered something that should have been obvious. + 

These crimes weren't politically motivated at all. + 

Instead, these guys were garden variety thugs who wanted to get paid by Friday so they could party through the weekend. + 

Once we understood the pattern and knew the kidnapper's self-imposed deadline, we had two key pieces of information that totally shifted the leverage to our side. + 

First, if we let the pressure build by stalling the negotiations until Thursday or Friday, we could cut the best deal. + 

And second, because you didn't need anything close to $150,000 to have a good weekend in Haiti, offering a lot lot less would suffice. + 

How close we were getting to their self-imposed deadline would be indicated by how specific the threats were that they issued. + 

Give us the money or your aunt is going to die is an early stage threat as the time isn't specified. + 

Increasing specificity on threats in any type of negotiations indicates getting closer to real consequences at a real specified time. + 

To gauge the level of a particular threat, we'd pay attention to how many of the four questions: what, who, when, and how, were addressed. + 

When people issue threats, they consciously or subconsciously create ambiguities and loopholes they fully intend to exploit. + 

As the loopholes started to close as the week progressed and did so over and over again in similar ways with different kidnappings, the pattern emerged. + 

With this information in hand, I came to expect the kidnappings to be orderly 4-day events. + 

It didn't make the abductions any more pleasant for the victim, but it certainly made them more predictable and a whole lot cheaper for the families on the other end. + 

It's not just with hostage negotiations that deadlines can play into your hands. + 

Car dealers are prone to give you the best price near the end of the month when their transactions are assessed and corporate salespeople work on a quarterly basis and are most vulnerable as the quarter comes to a close. + 

Now, knowing how negotiators use their counterparts deadlines to gain leverage would seem to suggest that it's best to keep your own deadline secret. + 

And that's the advice you'll get from most old school negotiation experts. + 

In his best-selling 1980 book, You Can Negotiate Anything, one negotiation expert, Herb Cohen, tells the story of his first big business deal, when his company sent him to Japan to negotiate with a supplier. + 

When he arrived, his counterparts asked him how long he was staying, and Cohen said a week. + 

For the next 7 days, his hosts proceeded to entertain him with parties, tours, and outings. + 

Everything but negotiation. + 

In fact, Cohen's counterparts didn't start serious talks until he was about to leave, and the two sides hammered out the deal's final details in the car to the airport. + 

Cohen landed in the United States with the sinking feeling that he'd been played and that he had conceded too much under deadline pressure. + 

Would he have told them his deadline in retrospect? No, Cohen says, because it gave them a tool he didn't have. + 

They knew my deadline, but I didn't know theirs. + 

That mentality is everywhere these days. + 

Seeing a simple rule to follow and assuming that a deadline is a strategic weakness, most negotiators follow Cohen's advice and hide their drop deadad date. + 

Allow me to let you in on a little secret. + 

Cohen and the herd of negotiation experts who follow his lead are wrong. + 

Deadlines cut both ways. + 

Cohen may well have been nervous about what his boss would say if he left Japan without an agreement. + 

But it's also true that Cohen's counterparts wouldn't have won if he'd left without a deal. + 

That's the key. + 

When the negotiation is over for one side, it's over for the other, too. + 

In fact, Don A. + 

Moore, a professor at the Hos School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, says that hiding a deadline actually puts the negotiator in the worst possible position. + 

In his research, he's found that hiding your deadlines dramatically increases the risk of an impass. + 

That's because having a deadline pushes you to speed up your concessions, but the other side, thinking that it has time, will just hold out for more. + 

Imagine if when NBA owners set a lockout deadline during contract negotiations, they didn't tell the players union. + 

they would concede and concede as the deadline approached, inciting the union to keep negotiating past the secret deadline. + 

In that sense, hiding a deadline means you're negotiating with yourself, and you always lose when you do so. + 

Moore discovered that when negotiators tell their counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals. + 

It's true. + 

First, by revealing your cutoff, you reduce the risk of impass. + 

And second, when an opponent knows your deadline, he'll get to the real deal and concession making more quickly. + 

I've got one final point to make before we move on. + 

Deadlines are almost never ironclad. + 

What's more important is engaging in the process and having a feel for how long that will take. + 

You may see that you have more to accomplish than time will actually allow before the clock runs out. + 

No such thing as fair. + 

In the third week of my negotiations class, we play my favorite type of game. + 

That is the kind that shows my students how much they don't understand themselves. + 

I know I'm cruel. + 

It's called the ultimatum game. + 

And it goes like this. + 

After the students split into pairs of a proposer and an acceptor, I give each proposer $10. + 

The proposer then has to offer the accepter a round number of dollars. + 

If the acceptor agrees, he or she receives what's been offered and the proposer gets the rest. + 

If the acceptor refuses the offer though, they both get nothing and the $10 goes back to me. + 

Whether they win and keep the money or lose and have to give it back is irrelevant except to my wallet. + 

What's important is the offer they make. + 

The truly shocking thing is that almost without exception, whatever selection anyone makes, they find themselves in a minority. + 

No matter whether they chose $6, $4, $5, $5, $7, $3, $8, $2, etc., they look around and are inevitably surprised to find no split was chosen far more than any other. + 

In something as simple as merely splitting $10 of found money, there is no consensus of what constitutes a fair or rational split. + 

After we run this little experiment, I stand up in front of the class and make a point they don't like to hear. + 

The reasoning each and every student used was 100% irrational and emotional. + 

What they say, I made a rational decision. + 

Then I lay out how they're wrong. + 

first. + 

How could they all be using reason if so many have made different offers? That's the point. + 

They didn't. + 

They assumed the other guy would reason just like them. + 

If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong. + 

I say that's not empathy. + 

That's projection. + 

And then I push it even further. + 

Why? I ask. + 

Did none of the proposers offer $1, which is the best rational offer for them and logically unrejectable for the acceptor? And if they did and they got rejected, which happens, why did the accepter turn them down? Anyone who made any offer other than $1 made an emotional choice, I say. + 

And for you aced $1, since when is getting zero better than getting $1? Did the rules of finance suddenly change? This rocks my students view of themselves as rational actors, but they're not. + 

None of us are. + 

We're all irrational, all emotional. + 

Emotion is a necessary element to decision-m that we ignore at our own peril. + 

Realizing that hits people hard between the eyes. + 

In on daycart's error, emotion, reason, and the human brain, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explained a groundbreaking discovery he made. + 

Studying people who had damage in the part of the brain where emotions are generated, he found that they all had something peculiar in common. + 

They couldn't make decisions. + 

They could describe what they should do in logical terms, but they found it impossible to make even the simplest choice. + 

In other words, while we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decisionmaking is governed by emotion. + 

The F-word, why it's so powerful, when to use it, and how. + 

The most powerful word in negotiations is fair. + 

As human beings, we're mightily swayed by how much we feel we have been respected. + 

People comply with agreements if they feel they've been treated fairly and lash out if they don't. + 

A decade of brain imaging studies has shown that human neural activity, particularly in the emotion regulating insular cortex, reflects the degree of unfairness in social interactions. + 

Even nonhuman primates are hardwired to reject unfairness. + 

In one famous study, two capacin monkeys were set to perform the same task, but one was rewarded with sweet grapes while the other received cucumbers. + 

In response to such blatant unfairness, the cucumber-fed monkey literally went bananas. + 

In the ultimatum game, years of experience has shown me that most acceptors will invariably reject any offer that is less than half of the proposer's money. + 

Once you get to a quarter of the proposer's money, you can forget it and the acptors are insulted. + 

Most people make an irrational choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers rather than to accept a derisory offer because the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs the positive rational value of the money. + 

This irrational reaction to unfairness extends all the way to serious economic deals. + 

Remember Robin Williams's great work as the voice of the genie in Disney's Aladdin? Because he wanted to leave something wonderful behind for his kids. + 

He said he did the voice for a cut rate fee of $75,000, far below his usual $8 million payday. + 

But then something happened. + 

The movie became a huge hit, raking in $54 million, and Williams went ballistic. + 

Now, look at this. + 

With the ultimatum game in mind, Williams wasn't angry because of the money. + 

It was the perceived unfairness that pissed him off. + 

He didn't complain about his contract until Aladdin became a blockbuster. + 

And then he and his agent went loud and long about how they got ripped off. + 

Lucky for Williams, Disney wanted to keep its star happy. + 

After initially pointing out the obvious that he'd happily signed the deal, Disney made the dramatic gesture of sending the star a Picasso painting worth a reported $1 million. + 

The nation of Iran was not so lucky. + 

In recent years, Iran has put up with sanctions that have cost it well over $100 billion dollar in foreign investment and oil revenue in order to defend a uranium enriching nuclear program that can only meet 2% of its energy needs. + 

In other words, like the students who won't take a free $1 because the offer seems insulting, Iran has screwed itself out of its chief source of income, oil and gas revenue, in order to pursue an energy project with little expected payoff. + 

Why? Again, fairness for Iran. + 

It's not fair that the global powers which together have several thousand nuclear weapons should be able to decide if it can use nuclear energy. + 

And why Iran wonders is it considered a pariah for enriching uranium when India and Pakistan which clandestinely acquired nuclear weapons are accepted members of the international community. + 

In a TV interview, former Iranian nuclear negotiator seeded Hussein Mousavian hit the nail on the head. + 

"The nuclear issue today for Iranians is not nuclear," he said. + 

"It's defending their integrity as an independent identity against the pressure of the rest." "You may not trust Iran, but its moves are pretty clear evidence that rejecting perceived unfairness, even at substantial cost, is a powerful motivation. + 

Once you understand what a messy, emotional, and destructive dynamic fairness can be, you can see why fair is a tremendously powerful word that you need to use with care. + 

In fact, of the three ways that people drop this fbomb, only one is positive. + 

The most common use is a judoike defensive move that destabilizes the other side. + 

This manipulation usually takes the form of something like, "We just want what's fair." Think back to the last time someone made this implicit accusation of unfairness to you, and I bet you'll have to admit that it immediately triggered feelings of defensiveness and discomfort. + 

These feelings are often subconscious and often lead to an irrational concession. + 

A friend of mine was selling her Boston home in a bust market a few years back. + 

The offer she got was much lower than she wanted. + 

It meant a big loss for her and out of frustration, she dropped this fbomb on the prospective buyer. + 

"We just want what's fair," she said. + 

Emotionally rattled by the implicit accusation, the guy raised his offer immediately. + 

"If you are on the business end of this accusation, you need to realize that the other side might not be trying to pick your pocket like my friend. + 

They might just be overwhelmed by circumstance. + 

The best response either way is to take a deep breath and restrain your desire to concede. + 

Then say, "Okay, I apologize. + 

Let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we'll fix it." The second use of the fbomb is more nefarious. + 

In this one, your counterpart will basically accuse you of being dense or dishonest by saying, "We've given you a fair offer." It's a terrible little jab meant to distract your attention and manipulate you into giving in. + 

Whenever someone tries this on me, I think back to the last NFL lockout. + 

Negotiations were getting down to the wire and the NFL Players Association, NFLPA, said that before they agreed to a final deal, they wanted the owners to open their books. + 

The owner's answer, "We've given the players a fair offer." Notice the horrible genius of this. + 

Instead of opening their books or declining to do so, the owners shifted the focus to the NFLPA's supposed lack of understanding of fairness. + 

If you find yourself in this situation, the best reaction is to simply mirror the f that has just been lobbed at you. + 

Fair, you'd respond, pausing to let the words power do to them as it was intended to do to you. + 

Follow that with a label. + 

It seems like you're ready to provide the evidence that supports that, which alludes to opening their books or otherwise handing over information that will either contradict their claim to fairness or give you more data to work with than you had previously. + 

Right away, you declaw the attack. + 

The last use of the f-word is my favorite because it's positive and constructive. + 

It sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation. + 

Here's how I use it. + 

Early on in a negotiation, I say, "I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. + 

So, please stop me at any time if you feel I'm being unfair, and we'll address it. + 

It's simple and clear and sets me up as an honest dealer." With that statement, I let people know it is okay to use that word with me if they use it honestly. + 

As a negotiator, you should strive for a reputation of being fair. + 

Your reputation precedes you. + 

Let it precede you in a way that paves success. + 

How to discover the emotional drivers behind what the other party values. + 

A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book How to Become a Rain Maker, and I like to review it occasionally to refresh my sense of the emotional drivers that fuel decisions. + 

The book does a great job to explain the sales job, not as a rational argument, but as an emotional framing job. + 

If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives, if you can get at what people are really buying, then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution. + 

Look at this from the most basic level. + 

What does a good babysitter sell really? It's not child care exactly, but a relaxed evening. + 

A furnace salesperson, cozy rooms for family time. + 

A locksmith, a feeling of security. + 

Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate. + 

Bend their reality. + 

Take the same person, change one or two variables, and $100 can be a glorious victory or a vicious insult. + 

Recognizing this phenomenon lets you bend reality from insult to victory. + 

Let me give you an example. + 

I have this coffee mug, red and white with the Swiss flag. + 

No chips, but used. + 

What would you pay for it deep down in your heart of hearts? You're probably going to say something like $3.50. + 

Let's say it's your mug now. + 

You're going to sell it to me. + 

So tell me what it's worth. + 

You're probably going to say something between five and $7. + 

In both cases, it was the exact same mug. + 

All I did was move the mug in relation to you, and I totally changed its value. + 

Or imagine that I offer you $20 to run a 3minute errand and get me a cup of coffee. + 

You're going to think to yourself that $20 for 3 minutes is $400 an hour. + 

You're going to be thrilled. + 

What if then you find out that by getting you to run that errand, I made a million dollar? You'd go from being ecstatic for making $400 an hour to being angry because you got ripped off. + 

The value of the $20, just like the value of the coffee mug, didn't change, but your perspective of it did. + 

Just by how I position the $20, I can make you happy or disgusted by it. + 

I tell you that not to expose our decision-making as emotional and irrational. + 

We've already seen that. + 

What I am saying is that while our decisions may be largely irrational, that doesn't mean there aren't consistent patterns, principles, and rules behind how we act. + 

And once you know those mental patterns, you start to see ways to influence them. + 

By far the best theory for describing the principles of our irrational decisions is something called prospect theory created in 1979 by the psychologists Daniel Conorman and Amos Ferski. + 

Prospect theory describes how people choose between options that involve risk like in a negotiation. + 

The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities even when the probability is a better choice. + 

That's called the certainty effect. + 

And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. + 

That's called loss aversion. + 

That's why people who statistically have no need for insurance buy it. + 

Or consider this. + 

A person who's told he has a 95% chance of receiving $10,000 or 100% chance of getting $9,499 will usually avoid risk and take the 100% certain safe choice. + 

While the same person who's told he has a 95% chance of losing $10,000 or 100% chance of losing $9,499 will make the opposite choice. + 

Risking the bigger 95% option to avoid the loss. + 

The chance for loss incites more risk than the possibility of an equal gain. + 

Over the next few pages, I'll explain a few prospect theory tactics you can use to your advantage. + 

But first, let me leave you with a crucial lesson about loss aversion. + 

In a tough negotiation, it's not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want. + 

To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through. + 

One, anchor their emotions. + 

To bend your counterparts reality, you have to start with the basics of empathy. + 

So start out with an accusation audit, acknowledging all of their fears. + 

By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side's loss aversion so that they'll jump at the chance to avoid it. + 

On my first consulting project after leaving the FBI, I received the honor to train the national hostage negotiation team for the United Arab Emirates. + 

Unfortunately, the prestige of the assignment was tempered during the project by problems with the general contractor. + 

I was a subcontractor. + 

The problems became so bad that I was going to have to go back to the contractors I'd signed up, who normally got $2,000 a day, and tell them that for several months, I could only offer $500. + 

I knew exactly what they would do if I just told them straight out. + 

They'd laugh me out of town. + 

So, I got each of them on the phone and hit them hard with an accusation audit. + 

I got a lousy proposition for you, I said and paused until each asked me to go on. + 

By the time we get off the phone, you're going to think I'm a lousy businessman. + 

You're going to think I can't budget or plan. + 

You're going to think Chris Voss is a big talker. + 

His first big project ever out of the FBI, he screws it up completely. + 

He doesn't know how to run an operation. + 

And he might even have lied to me. + 

And then once I'd anchored their emotions in a minefield of low expectations, I played on their loss aversion. + 

Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity to you before I took it to someone else, I said. + 

Suddenly, their call wasn't about being cut from $2,000 to $500, but how not to lose $500 to some other guy. + 

Every single one of them took the deal. + 

No counter offers, no complaints. + 

Now, if I hadn't anchored their emotions low, their perception of $500 would have been totally different. + 

If I just called and said, "I can give you $500 per day. + 

What do you think?" They'd have taken it as an insult and slammed down the phone. + 

Two, let the other guy go first most of the time. + 

Now, it's clear that the benefits of anchoring emotions are great when it comes to bending your counterparts reality, but going first is not necessarily the best thing when it comes to negotiating price. + 

When the famous film director Billy Wilder went to hire the famous detective novelist Raymond Chandler to write the 1944 classic Double Indemnity, Chandler was new to Hollywood, but he came ready to negotiate. + 

And in his meeting with Wilder and the movie's producer, Chandler made the first salary offer. + 

He bluffly demanded $150 per week and warned Wilder that it might take him 3 weeks to finish the project. + 

Wilder and the producer could barely stop from laughing because they had been planning to pay Chandler $750 per week, and they knew that movie scripts took months to write. + 

Lucky for Chandler, Wilder and the producer valued their relationship with Chandler more than a few hundred. + 

So, they took pity on him and called an agent to represent Chandler in the negotiations. + 

Similarly, I had a student named Jerry who royally screwed up his salary negotiation by going first. + 

Let me say that this happened before he was my student. + 

In an interview at a New York financial firm, he demanded $110,000 in large part because it represented a 30% raise. + 

It was only after he started that the firm had started everybody else in his program at $125,000. + 

That's why I suggest you let the other side anchor monetary negotiations. + 

The real issue is that neither side has perfect information going to the table. + 

This often means you don't know enough to open with confidence. + 

That's especially true anytime you don't know the market value of what you are buying or selling, like with Jerry or Chandler. + 

By letting them anchor, you also might get lucky. + 

I've experienced many negotiations when the other party's first offer was higher than the closing figure I had in mind. + 

If I'd gone first, they would have agreed and I would have left with either the winner's curse or buyer's remorse. + 

Those gut-wrenching feelings that you've overpaid or undersold. + 

That said, you've got to be careful when you let the other guy anchor. + 

You have to prepare yourself psychically to withstand the first offer. + 

If the other guy's a pro, a shark, he's going to go for an extreme anchor in order to bend your reality. + 

Then when they come back with a merely absurd offer, it will seem reasonable. + 

Just like an expensive $400 iPhone seems reasonable after they mark it down from a crazy $600. + 

The tendency to be anchored by extreme numbers is a psychological quirk known as the anchor and adjustment effect. + 

Researchers have discovered that we tend to make adjustments from our first reference points. + 

For example, most people glimpsing 8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1 estimate that it yields a higher result than the same string in reverse order. + 

That's because we focus on the first numbers and extrapolate. + 

That's not to say never open. + 

Rules like that are easy to remember, but like most simplistic approaches, they are not always good advice. + 

If you're dealing with a rookie counterpart, you might be tempted to be the shark and throw out an extreme anchor. + 

Or if you really know the market and you're dealing with an equally informed pro, you might offer a number just to make the negotiation go faster. + 

Here's my personal advice on whether or not you want to be the shark that eats a rookie counterpart. + 

Just remember, your reputation precedes you. + 

I've run into CEOs whose reputation was to always badly beat their counterpart and pretty soon no one would deal with them. + 

Three, establish a range. + 

While going first rarely helps, there is one way to seem to make an offer and bend their reality in the process. + 

That is by alluding to a range. + 

What I mean is this. + 

When confronted with naming your terms or price, counter by recalling a similar deal, which establishes your ballpark, albeit the best possible ballpark you wish to be in. + 

Instead of saying, "I'm worth $110,000," Jerry might have said, "At top places like XC Corp, people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000." That gets your point across without moving the other party into a defensive position. + 

and it gets him thinking at higher levels. + 

Research shows that people who hear extreme anchors unconsciously adjust their expectations in the direction of the opening number. + 

Many even go directly to their price limit. + 

If Jerry had given this range, the firm probably would have offered $130,000 because it looked so cheap next to $170,000. + 

In a recent study, four Colombia Business School psychologists found that job applicants who named a range received significantly higher overall salaries than those who offered a number, especially if their range was a bolstering range in which the low number in the range was what they actually wanted. + 

Understand if you offer a range and it's a good idea to do so, expect them to come in at the low end. + 

Four, pivot to non-monetary terms. + 

People get hung up on how much, but don't deal with numbers in isolation. + 

That leads to bargaining, a series of rigid positions defined by emotional views of fairness and pride. + 

Negotiation is a more intricate and subtle dynamic than that. + 

One of the easiest ways to bend your counterparts reality to your point of view is by pivoting to non-monetary terms. + 

After you've anchored them high, you can make your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren't important to you, but could be important to them. + 

Or if their offer is low, you could ask for things that matter more to you than them. + 

Since this is sometimes difficult, what we often do is throw out examples to start the brainstorming process. + 

Not long ago, I did some training for the Memphis Bar Association. + 

Normally for the training they were looking for, I charged $25,000 a day. + 

They came in with a much lower offer that I bulked at. + 

They then offered to do a cover story about me in their association magazine. + 

For me to be on the cover of a magazine that went out to who knows how many of the country's top lawyers was priceless advertising. + 

Plus, my mom is really proud of it. + 

They had to put something on the cover anyway, so it had zero cost to them and I gave them a steep discount on my fee. + 

I constantly use that as an example in my negotiations. + 

Now, when I name a price, I want to stimulate my counterparts brainstorming to see what valuable non-monetary gems they might have that are cheap to them but valuable to me. + 

Five, when you do talk numbers, use odd ones. + 

Every number has a psychological significance that goes beyond its value. + 

And I'm not just talking about how you love 17 because you think it's lucky. + 

What I mean is that in terms of negotiation, some numbers appear more immovable than others. + 

The biggest thing to remember is that numbers that end in zero inevitably feel like temporary placeholders, gueststimates that you can easily be negotiated off of. + 

But anything you throw out that sounds less rounded, say $37,263, feels like a figure that you came to as a result of thoughtful calculation. + 

Such numbers feel serious and permanent to your counterpart. + 

So use them to fortify your offers. + 

Six, surprise with a gift. + 

You can get your counterpart into a mood of generosity by staking an extreme anchor and then after their inevitable first rejection, offering them a wholly unrelated surprise gift. + 

Unexpected consiliatory gestures like this are hugely effective because they introduce a dynamic called reciprocity. + 

The other party feels the need to answer your generosity in kind. + 

they will suddenly come up on their offer or they'll look to repay your kindness in the future. + 

People feel obliged to repay debts of kindness. + 

Let's look at it in terms of international politics. + 

In 1977, Egyptian President Anoir Sedat dramatically pushed negotiations on the Egyptrail peace treaty forward by making a surprise address to the Israeli Knesset. + 

a generous gesture that did not involve making any actual concessions, but did signify a big step toward peace. + 

Back in Haiti, a few hours after the kidnappers had snatched his aunt, I was on the phone with the politician's nephew. + 

There was no way their family could come up with $150,000, he told me. + 

But they could pay between $50,000 and $85,000. + 

But since learning that the ransom was just party money, I was aiming much lower, $5,000. + 

We were not going to compromise. + 

It was a matter of professional pride. + 

I advised him to start off by anchoring the conversation in the idea that he didn't have the money, but to do so without saying no, so as not to hit their pride headon. + 

How am I supposed to do that? He asked in the next call. + 

The kidnapper made another general threat against the aunt and again demanded the cash. + 

That's when I had the nephew subtly question the kidnapper's fairness. + 

I'm sorry, the nephew responded, but how are we supposed to pay if you're going to hurt her? That brought up the aunt's death, which was the thing the kidnappers most wanted to avoid. + 

They needed to keep her unharmed if they hoped to get any money. + 

They were commodity traders after all. + 

Notice that to this point, the nephew hadn't named a price. + 

This game of attrition finally pushed the kidnappers to name a number first. + 

Without proddding, they dropped to $50,000. + 

Now that the kidnapper's reality had been bent to a smaller number, my colleagues and I told the nephew to stand his ground. + 

"How can I come up with that kind of money?" we told him to ask. + 

Again, the kidnapper dropped his demand to $25,000. + 

Now that we had him in our sights, we had the nephew make his first offer, an extreme low anchor of $3,000. + 

The line went silent, and the nephew began to sweat profusely, but we told him to hold tight. + 

This always happened at the moment the kidnapper's economic reality got totally rearranged. + 

When he spoke again, the kidnapper seemed shell shocked. + 

But he went on. + 

His next offer was lower. + 

$10,000. + 

Then we had the nephew answer with a strange number that seemed to come from deep calculation of what his aunt's life was worth. + 

$4,751. + 

His new price, $7,500. + 

In response, we had the cousin spontaneously say he'd throw in a new portable CD stereo and repeated the $4,751. + 

The kidnappers who didn't really want the CD stereo felt there was no more money to be had said yes. + 

6 hours later the family paid that sum and the aunt came back home safely. + 

How to negotiate a better salary. + 

One of the critical factors in business school rankings is how well their graduates are compensated. + 

So, I tell every MBA class I lecture that my first objective is to single-handedly raise the ranking of their school by teaching them how to negotiate a better salary. + 

I break down the process into three parts that blend this chapter's dynamics in a way that not only brings you better money, but convinces your boss to fight to get it for you. + 

Be pleasantly persistent on non-salary terms. + 

Pleasant persistence is a kind of emotional anchoring that creates empathy with the boss and builds the right psychological environment for constructive discussion. + 

And the more you talk about non- salary terms, the more likely you are to hear the full range of their options. + 

If they can't meet your non- salary requests, they may even counter with more money like they did with a French-born American former student of mine. + 

She kept asking with a big smile for an extra week of vacation beyond what the company normally gave. + 

She was French, she said, and that's what French people did. + 

The hiring company was completely handcuffed on the vacation issue. + 

But because she was so darn delightful and because she introduced a non-monetary variable into the notion of her value, they countered by increasing her salary offer. + 

Salary terms without success terms is Russian roulette. + 

Once you've negotiated a salary, make sure to define success for your position as well as metrics for your next raise. + 

That's meaningful for you and free for your boss. + 

Much like giving me a magazine cover story was for the bar association. + 

It gets you a planned raise. + 

And by defining your success in relation to your boss's supervision, it leads into the next step. + 

Spark their interest in your success and gain an unofficial mentor. + 

Remember the idea of figuring what the other side is really buying. + 

Well, when you are selling yourself to a manager, sell yourself as more than a body for a job. + 

Sell yourself and your success as a way they can validate their own intelligence and broadcast it to the rest of the company. + 

Make sure they know you'll act as a flesh and blood argument for their importance. + 

Once you've bent their reality to include you as their ambassador, they'll have a stake in your success. + 

Ask, "What does it take to be successful here?" Please notice that this question is similar to questions that are suggested by many MBA career counseling centers, yet not exactly the same. + 

And it's the exact wording of this question that's critical. + 

Students from my MBA courses who have asked this question in job interviews have actually had interviewers lean forward and say, "No one ever asked us that before." The interviewer then gave a great and detailed answer. + 

The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance, they will watch to see if you follow their advice. + 

They will have a personal stake in seeing you succeed. + 

You've just recruited your first unofficial mentor. + 

To show how this can be done to near perfection, I can think of no better example than my former MBA student, Angel Praau. + 

While Angel was finishing up his MBA, he went to his boss and began to lay the groundwork for his work postNBA, which the company was paying. + 

During his last semester, he set a non-specific anchor, a kind of range, by suggesting to his boss that once he graduated and the company was done investing in his MBA around $31,000 per year, that money should go to him as salary. + 

His boss made no commitment, but Angel was pleasantly persistent about it, which set the idea as an anchor in his boss's mind. + 

Upon graduation, Angel and his boss had their big sitdown. + 

In an assertive and calm manner, Angel broached a non-financial issue to move the focus away from how much. + 

He asked for a new title. + 

Angel's boss readily agreed that a new role was a no-brainer after Angel's new degree. + 

At that point, Angel and his manager defined what his roles and responsibilities would be in his new role, thereby setting success metrics. + 

Then Angel took a breath and paused so that his boss would be the first to throw out a number. + 

At last, he did. + 

Curiously enough, the number showed that Angel's earlier efforts at anchoring had worked. + 

He proposed to add $31,000 to Angel's base salary, almost a 50% raise. + 

But Angel was no rookie negotiator. + 

Not after taking my class. + 

So instead of countering and getting stuck in how much, he kept talking, labeling the boss's emotions and empathizing with his situation. + 

At the time, the company was going through difficult negotiations with its investors. + 

And then Angel courteously asked for a moment to step away and print up the agreed upon job description. + 

This pause created a dynamic of pre-deline urgency in his boss, which Angel exploited when he returned with the printout. + 

On the bottom, he'd added his desired compensation, 134,5K, 143K. + 

In that one little move, Angel weaved together a bunch of the lessons from this chapter. + 

The odd numbers gave them the weight of thoughtful calculation. + 

The numbers were high, too, which exploited his boss's natural tendency to go directly to his price limit when faced by an extreme anchor. + 

And they were a range, which made Angel seem less aggressive. + 

and the lower end more reasonable in comparison. + 

From his boss's body language, raised eyebrows, it was clear that he was surprised by the compensation request, but it had the desired effect. + 

After some comments about the description, he countered with $120,000. + 

Angel didn't say no or yes, but kept talking and creating empathy. + 

Then in the middle of a sentence, seemingly out of the blue, his boss threw out $127,000. + 

With his boss obviously negotiating with himself, Angel kept him going. + 

Finally, his boss said he agreed with the $134,500 and would pay that salary starting in 3 months contingent on the board of directors approval. + 

As the icing on the cake, Angel worked in a positive use of the word fair. + 

That's fair, he said, and then sold the raise to his boss as a marriage in which his boss would be the mentor. + 

I'm asking you, not the board, for the promotion, and all I need is for you to agree with it, he said. + 

And how did Angel's boss reply to his new ambassador? I'll fight to get you this salary. + 

So, follow Angel's lead and make it rain. + 

Key lessons. + 

Compared to the tools discussed in previous chapters, the techniques here seem concrete and easy to use. + 

But many people shy away from them because they seem manipulative. + 

Something that bends your counterparts reality must be cheating, right? In response, let me just say that these tools are used by all the best negotiators because they simply recognize the human psyche as it is. + 

We are emotional, irrational beasts who are emotional and irrational in predictable pattern-filled ways. + 

Using that knowledge is only well rational. + 

As you work these tools into your daily life, remember the following powerful lessons. + 

All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. + 

Don't let yourself be fooled by the surface. + 

Once you know that the Haitian kidnappers just want party money, you will be miles better prepared. + 

Splitting the difference is wearing one black and one brown shoe, so don't compromise. + 

Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides. + 

Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process and do impulsive things that are against their best interests. + 

The fur word fair is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side on the defensive and gain concessions. + 

When your counterpart drops the fbomb, don't get suckered into a concession. + 

Instead, ask them to explain how you're mistreating them. + 

You can bend your counterparts reality by anchoring his starting point. + 

Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be. + 

When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your real offers seem reasonable or use a range to seem less aggressive. + 

The real value of anything depends on what vantage point you're looking at it from. + 

People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. + 

Make sure your counterpart sees that there is something to lose by inaction. +
