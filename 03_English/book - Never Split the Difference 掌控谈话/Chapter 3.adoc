== 释义

Don't feel their pain. +

[.my2]
不要感受他们的痛苦。+

Label it. +

[.my2]
为其贴标签。+

It was 1998 and I was standing in a narrow 狭窄的 hallway 走廊 outside an apartment 公寓 on the 27th floor 楼层 of a high-rise 高层建筑 in Harlem 哈莱姆区（美国纽约市的一个黑人居住区）. +

[.my2]
那是1998年，我站在哈莱姆区一栋高层建筑27楼的一间公寓外的狭窄走廊里。+

I was the head 负责人；主管 of the New York City FBI crisis 危机 negotiation 谈判 team 团队. +

[.my2]
我当时是纽约市联邦调查局（FBI）危机谈判小组的负责人。+

And that day, I was the primary 主要的；首要的 negotiator 谈判者. +

[.my2]
那天，我是主谈判官。+

The investigative 调查的 squad 小组；小队 had reported 报告 that at least three heavily 大量地；严重地 armed 武装的 fugitives 逃犯 were holed up 躲藏；潜伏 inside. +

[.my2]
调查小组报告称，至少有三名全副武装的逃犯躲藏在里面。+

Several days earlier 早些时候, the fugitives had used automatic 自动的 weapons 武器 in a shootout 枪战 with a rival 敌对的 gang 帮派；团伙. +

[.my2]
几天前，这些逃犯在与敌对帮派的枪战中使用了自动武器。+

So, the New York City FBI SWAT 特种武器和战术（全称Special Weapons and Tactics） team was arrayed 排列；部署 behind me and our snipers 狙击手 were on nearby 附近的 rooftops 屋顶 with rifles 步枪 trained on 对准；瞄准 the apartment windows. +

[.my2]
因此，纽约市联邦调查局特种战术小队部署在我身后，狙击手则在附近的屋顶上，步枪瞄准着公寓的窗户。+

In tense 紧张的 situations 情况；局面 like this, the traditional 传统的 negotiating 谈判的 advice 建议 is to keep a poker face 面无表情；不动声色. +

[.my2]
在这样的紧张局面下，传统的谈判建议是保持面无表情。+

Don't get emotional 情绪激动的. +

[.my2]
不要情绪化。+

Until recently 最近, most academics 学者 and researchers 研究者 completely 完全地 ignored 忽视 the role 作用；角色 of emotion 情绪 in negotiation. +

[.my2]
直到最近，大多数学者和研究者都完全忽视了情绪在谈判中的作用。+

Emotions were just an obstacle 障碍 to a good outcome 结果, they said. +

[.my2]
他们称，情绪只是达成良好结果的障碍。+

Separate 分开；分离 the people from the problem 问题 was the common refrain 一再重复的话；老调. +

[.my2]
“把人和问题分开”是人们常挂在嘴边的话。+

But think about that. +

[.my2]
但仔细想想。+

How can you separate people from the problem when their emotions are the problem? Especially 尤其 when they are scared 害怕的 people with guns 枪. +

[.my2]
当人们的情绪本身就是问题所在时，你怎么能把人和问题分开呢？尤其是当他们是持枪的受惊者时。+

Emotions are one of the main 主要的 things that derail 使偏离轨道；阻碍 communication 沟通. +

[.my2]
情绪是阻碍沟通的主要因素之一。+

Once 一旦 people get upset 心烦的；不安的 at one another 彼此, rational 理性的 thinking 思考 goes out the window 不再被考虑；抛到九霄云外. +

[.my2]
一旦人们彼此心烦意乱，理性思考就会被抛到九霄云外。+

That's why instead of denying 否认 or ignoring 忽视 emotions, good negotiators 谈判者 identify 识别；确认 and influence 影响 them. +

[.my2]
这就是为什么优秀的谈判者不会否认或忽视情绪，而是会识别并影响情绪。+

They are able to precisely 精确地；准确地 label 贴标签；标注 emotions, those of others, and especially 尤其 their own. +

[.my2]
他们能够精确地为情绪贴标签，无论是他人的情绪，尤其是自己的情绪。+

And once they label the emotions, they talk about them without getting wound up 紧张的；激动的. +

[.my2]
一旦为情绪贴上标签，他们就会谈论这些情绪，而不会变得激动。+

For them, emotion is a tool 工具. +

[.my2]
对他们来说，情绪是一种工具。+

Emotions aren't the obstacles 障碍. +

[.my2]
情绪不是障碍。+

They are the means 方式；方法. +

[.my2]
它们是达成目的的方式。+

The relationship 关系 between an emotionally 情感上；情绪上 intelligent 聪明的；有才智的 negotiator and their counterpart 对方；对手 is essentially 本质上；根本上 therapeutic 治疗的；有疗效的. +

[.my2]
情商高的谈判者与对手之间的关系，本质上具有治疗性。+

It duplicates 复制；重现 that of a psychotherapist 心理治疗师 with a patient 病人. +

[.my2]
这种关系类似于心理治疗师与患者之间的关系。+

The psychotherapist pokes 探问；探究 and prods 催促；追问 to understand his patients problems and then turns the responses 回应 back onto the patient to get him to go deeper 更深入地 and change his behavior 行为. +

[.my2]
心理治疗师会通过探问和追问来了解患者的问题，然后将患者的回应反馈给他们，促使他们更深入地思考并改变自己的行为。+

That's exactly 正是；恰好 what good negotiators do. +

[.my2]
这正是优秀的谈判者所做的。+

Getting to this level 水平；程度 of emotional intelligence 情商 demands 要求 opening up your senses 感官, talking less, and listening more. +

[.my2]
要达到这种情商水平，需要开放你的感官，少说多听。+

You can learn almost everything you need and a lot more than other people would like you to know simply 简单地 by watching 观察 and listening, keeping your eyes peeled 警惕的；留神的 and your ears open 留心听 and your mouth shut 保持沉默. +

[.my2]
只需通过观察和倾听，保持警惕、留心听并保持沉默，你几乎可以学到所有你需要的东西，甚至比别人希望你知道的还要多。+

Think about the therapist's couch 长沙发 as you read the following 以下的 sections 部分. +

[.my2]
在阅读以下部分时，请想象一下治疗师的诊疗长沙发。+

You'll see how a soothing 使人平静的；安慰性的 voice 声音, close 密切的 listening, and a calm 平静的 repetition 重复 of the words of your patient can get you a lot further 更远地 than a cold 冷漠的, rational 理性的 argument 争论. +

[.my2]
你会发现，温和的声音、专注的倾听以及平静地重复患者的话语，比冷漠的理性争论更能让你取得进展。+

It may sound touchy-feely 多愁善感的；感情用事的, but if you can perceive 察觉；感知 the emotions of others, you have a chance 机会 to turn them to your advantage 优势. +

[.my2]
这听起来可能有些多愁善感，但如果你能察觉他人的情绪，你就有机会将其转化为自己的优势。+

[.my2]
你对别人了解得越多，你的影响力就越大。+

We had one big 重大的 problem 问题 that day in Harlem. +

[.my2]
那天在哈莱姆区，我们遇到了一个大问题。+

No telephone number 电话号码 to call into the apartment. +

[.my2]
没有可以打进公寓的电话号码。+

So, for six straight 连续的 hours 小时, relieved 接替；换班 periodically 定期地；偶尔 by two FBI agents 特工 who were learning crisis 危机 negotiation 谈判, I spoke through the apartment door. +

[.my2]
因此，在六个小时里，我隔着公寓门喊话，期间偶尔由两名正在学习危机谈判的联邦调查局特工接替我。+

I used my late night 深夜的 FM DJ 调频音乐节目主持人 voice 声音. +

[.my2]
我用了深夜调频音乐节目主持人的那种声音。+

I didn't give orders 命令 in my DJ voice or ask what the fugitives 逃犯 wanted. +

[.my2]
我没有用这种声音下达命令，也没有询问逃犯们想要什么。+

Instead 相反, I imagined 想象 myself in their place 处境；位置. +

[.my2]
相反，我设身处地地为他们着想。+

It looks like you don't want to come out, I said repeatedly 反复地. +

[.my2]
“看起来你们不想出来，”我反复说道。+

It seems like you worry 担心 that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing （枪）猛烈开火. +

[.my2]
“看起来你们担心一旦开门，我们就会持枪冲进来。”+

It looks like you don't want to go back to jail 监狱. +

[.my2]
“看起来你们不想回到监狱里去。”+

For 6 hours, we got no response 回应. +

[.my2]
六个小时里，我们没有得到任何回应。+

The FBI coaches 教练 loved my DJ voice, but was it working 起作用；有效? And then when we were almost completely 完全地 convinced 确信的 that no one was inside, a sniper 狙击手 on an adjacent 相邻的 building radioed 用无线电发送消息 that he saw one of the curtains 窗帘 in the apartment move. +

[.my2]
联邦调查局的教练们很喜欢我的“DJ声线”，但它真的有用吗？就在我们几乎完全确信里面没人时，旁边一栋楼里的狙击手用无线电报告说，他看到公寓里的一块窗帘动了。+

The front door 前门 of the apartment slowly 慢慢地 opened. +

[.my2]
公寓的前门缓缓打开了。+

A woman emerged 出现 with her hands in front of her. +

[.my2]
一个女人走了出来，双手举在身前。+

I continued 继续 talking. +

[.my2]
我继续说话。+

All three fugitives 逃犯 came out. +

[.my2]
三名逃犯都走了出来。+

None of them said a word until we had them in handcuffs 手铐. +

[.my2]
直到我们给他们戴上手铐，他们都一言未发。+

Then I asked them the question 问题 that was most nagging 烦人的；令人困扰的 me. +

[.my2]
然后我问了他们一个最让我困惑的问题。+

Why did they come out after 6 hours of radio silence 无线电静默（此处指无回应状态）? Why did they finally 最终 give in 屈服；让步? All three gave me the same answer 答案. +

[.my2]
为什么在六个小时的“无回应”后，他们会出来？为什么他们最终会屈服？三个人给了我同样的答案。+

We didn't want to get caught 被抓住 or get shot 被枪击, but you calmed 使平静；使镇静 us down, they said. +

[.my2]
“我们不想被抓或被开枪击中，但你让我们平静了下来，”他们说。+

We finally 最终 believed 相信 you wouldn't go away 离开, so we just came out. +

[.my2]
“我们最终相信你不会离开，所以就出来了。”+

There is nothing more frustrating 令人沮丧的 or disruptive 破坏性的 to any negotiation 谈判 than to get the feeling 感觉 you are talking to someone who isn't listening 倾听. +

[.my2]
在任何谈判中，没有什么比感觉自己在和一个根本不听你说话的人交谈更令人沮丧、更具破坏性的了。+

Playing dumb 装傻；装糊涂 is a valid 有效的 negotiating technique 技巧 and I don't understand 理解 is a legitimate 合理的；合法的 response 回应, but ignoring 忽视 the other party's 另一方的 position 立场 only builds up 逐渐增加 frustration 沮丧 and makes them less likely 可能的 to do what you want. +

[.my2]
装傻是一种有效的谈判技巧，“我不明白”也是一种合理的回应，但忽视对方的立场只会加剧对方的沮丧情绪，使他们不太可能按你希望的去做。+

The opposite 相反的 of that is tactical 战术的 empathy 共情. +

[.my2]
与此相反的是战术共情。+

In my negotiating course 课程, I tell my students 学生 that empathy is the ability 能力 to recognize 识别 the perspective 视角 of a counterpart 对方 and the vocalization 用言语表达 of that recognition. +

[.my2]
在我的谈判课程中，我告诉学生，共情是识别对方视角并能用言语表达这种识别的能力。+

That's an academic 学术的 way of saying that empathy is paying attention to 关注 another human being 人, asking what they are feeling 感受 and making a commitment 承诺 to understanding 理解 their world 世界. +

[.my2]
用通俗的话来说，共情就是关注另一个人，询问他们的感受，并承诺去理解他们的世界。+

Notice 注意 I didn't say anything about agreeing with 同意 the other person's values 价值观 and beliefs 信念 or giving out 给予 hugs 拥抱. +

[.my2]
请注意，我并没有说要同意对方的价值观和信念，或者给予拥抱。+

That's sympathy 同情. +

[.my2]
那是同情。+

What I'm talking about is trying to understand 理解 a situation 情况 from another person's perspective 视角. +

[.my2]
我说的是尝试从别人的视角去理解一种情况。+

One step 步骤 beyond 超越 that is tactical empathy. +

[.my2]
在此基础上再进一步就是战术共情。+

Tactical empathy is understanding 理解 the feelings 感受 and mindset 心态 of another in the moment 此刻 and also hearing 听出 what is behind 隐藏在……背后 those feelings. +

[.my2]
战术共情是指在当下理解他人的感受和心态，并听出这些感受背后的原因。+

So you increase 增加 your influence 影响力 in all the moments 时刻 that follow 随后. +

[.my2]
这样，在接下来的所有时刻，你就能增强自己的影响力。+

It's bringing 使……关注 our attention to both the emotional 情感的 obstacles 障碍 and the potential 潜在的 pathways 途径 to getting an agreement 协议 done. +

[.my2]
它能让我们同时关注达成协议过程中的情感障碍和潜在途径。+

It's emotional intelligence 情商 on steroids （非正式）极大地增强；如虎添翼（原指类固醇）. +

[.my2]
它是如虎添翼的情商。+

As a cop 警察 in Kansas City 堪萨斯城（美国城市）, I was curious 好奇的 about how a select 精选的 handful 少数 of veteran 经验丰富的 cops managed to talk angry 愤怒的 violent 暴力的 people out of 说服……不做某事 fights 争斗 or to get them to put down 放下 their knives 刀 and guns 枪. +

[.my2]
作为堪萨斯城的一名警察，我很好奇为什么少数几位经验丰富的警察能够说服愤怒的暴力分子不打架，或者让他们放下刀枪。+

When I asked how they did that, I rarely 很少地 got more than a shrug 耸肩. +

[.my2]
当我问他们是怎么做到的时，他们大多只是耸耸肩，说不出个所以然。+

They couldn't articulate 清楚地表达 what they did. +

[.my2]
他们无法清楚地表达自己做了什么。+

But now I know the answer 答案 is tactical 战术的 empathy 共情. +

[.my2]
但现在我知道答案是战术共情。+

They were able to think from another person's point of view 视角 while they were talking with that person and quickly 快速地 assess 评估 what was driving 驱使 them. +

[.my2]
他们在与对方交谈时，能够站在对方的角度思考，并迅速评估是什么在驱使对方。+

Most of us enter 进入 verbal 言语的 combat 争斗 unlikely 不太可能的 to persuade 说服 anyone of anything because we only know and care about 关心 our own goals 目标 and perspective 视角. +

[.my2]
我们大多数人在进行言语交锋时，都不太可能说服任何人，因为我们只知道并关心自己的目标和视角。+

But the best officers 官员；警察 are tuned in to 了解；熟悉 the other party 对方, their audience 听众；对象. +

[.my2]
但最优秀的警察会了解对方，了解他们的沟通对象。+

They know that if they empathize 共情, they can mold 塑造 their audience by how they approach 接近；与……打交道 and talk to them. +

[.my2]
他们知道，如果他们共情，就能通过接触和交谈的方式来影响对方。+

That's why if a corrections officer 狱警 approaches 接近 an inmate 囚犯 expecting 预期 him to resist 抵抗, he often will. +

[.my2]
这就是为什么如果狱警在接近囚犯时预期对方会反抗，囚犯往往就会反抗。+

But if he approaches exuding 流露；散发 calm 平静, the inmate will be much more likely 可能的 to be peaceful 平和的. +

[.my2]
但如果狱警在接近时流露出平静，囚犯就更有可能表现得平和。+

It seems like 似乎 wizardry 魔法；巫术, but it's not. +

[.my2]
这看起来像魔法，但并非如此。+

It's just that when the officer has his audience 听众；对象 clearly 清楚地 in mind 脑海中, he can become who he needs to be to handle 处理 the situation 情况. +

[.my2]
这只是因为当警察清楚地了解自己的沟通对象时，他就能成为处理这种情况所需要的那种人。+

Empathy 共情 is a classic 典型的 soft 柔和的；非强硬的 communication 沟通 skill 技能, but it has a physical 身体的 basis 基础. +

[.my2]
共情是一种典型的软性沟通技巧，但它有生理基础。+

When we closely 密切地 observe 观察 a person's face 面部, gestures 手势, and tone of voice 语气, our brain 大脑 begins to align with 与……一致 theirs in a process 过程 called neural resonance 神经共振（指大脑神经元活动同步的现象）, and that lets us know more fully 充分地 what they think and feel. +

[.my2]
当我们仔细观察一个人的面部表情、手势和语气时，我们的大脑会在一个叫做“神经共振”的过程中开始与对方的大脑同步，这能让我们更充分地了解他们的想法和感受。+

In an fMRI 功能性磁共振成像（全称functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging） brain scan 脑部扫描 experiment 实验, researchers 研究者 at Princeton University 普林斯顿大学 found that neural resonance disappears 消失 when people communicate 沟通 poorly 糟糕地. +

[.my2]
在普林斯顿大学的一项功能性磁共振成像脑部扫描实验中，研究人员发现，当人们沟通不畅时，神经共振就会消失。+

The researchers could predict 预测 how well people were communicating by observing 观察 how much their brains were aligned 一致的. +

[.my2]
研究人员通过观察人们大脑的同步程度，就能预测他们的沟通效果。+

And they discovered 发现 that people who paid the most attention 关注, good listeners 倾听者, could actually 实际上 anticipate 预料；预期 what the speaker 说话者 was about to say before he said it. +

[.my2]
他们还发现，那些最专注的人——也就是善于倾听的人——实际上能在说话者开口之前就预料到对方要说什么。+

If you want to increase 提高 your neural resonance skills 技能, take a moment 片刻 right now and practice 练习. +

[.my2]
如果你想提高自己的神经共振能力，现在就花点时间练习一下。+

Turn your attention 注意力 to someone who's talking near you or watch a person being interviewed 采访 on TV. +

Just ask former 前的 Secretary of State 国务卿 Hillary Clinton 希拉里·克林顿. +

[.my2]

A few years ago, during a speech 演讲 at Georgetown University 乔治城大学, Clinton advocated 主张；提倡 showing respect 尊重 even for one's enemies 敌人, trying to understand 理解 and in so far as 就……而言 psychologically 心理上地 possible 可能的, empathize with 共情；同理心 their perspective 视角 and point of view 观点. +

[.my2]
几年前，克林顿在乔治城大学的一次演讲中主张，即使对敌人也要表示尊重，要努力理解他们，并在心理上尽可能地共情他们的视角和观点。+

You can predict 预测 what happened next 接下来. +

[.my2]
你可以预料到接下来发生了什么。+

A gaggle 一群（常指喧闹的人） of pundits 专家；评论员 and politicians 政治家 pounced on 猛烈抨击 her. +

[.my2]
一群评论员和政治家猛烈抨击了她。+

有人说她毁掉了自己竞选总统的机会。+

The problem 问题 with all of that hot air 夸夸其谈；空话 is that she was right 正确的. +

[.my2]
这些夸夸其谈的言论的问题在于，她是对的。+

Politics 政治 aside 撇开不谈, empathy 共情 is not about being nice 友好的 or agreeing with 同意 the other side 一方. +

[.my2]
撇开政治不谈，共情不是要表现得友好或同意对方的观点。+

It's about understanding 理解 them. +

[.my2]
而是要理解他们。+

Empathy helps us learn the position 立场 the enemy 敌人 is in, why their actions 行动 make sense 有意义；合理 to them, and what might move 打动；促使 them. +

[.my2]
共情能帮助我们了解敌人所处的立场，了解为什么他们的行为对他们来说是合理的，以及什么可能会促使他们改变。+

Labeling 贴标签；标注. +

[.my2]
贴标签。+

Let's go back to 回到 the Harlem doorway 门口 for a minute. +

[.my2]
让我们再回到哈莱姆区的那扇门前。+

We didn't have a lot to go on 依据；线索, but if you've got three fugitives 逃犯 trapped 被困的 in an apartment 公寓 on the 27th floor 楼层 of a building in Harlem, they don't have to say a word for you to know that they're worried about 担心 two things: getting killed 被杀死 and going to jail 监狱. +

[.my2]
我们没有太多线索，但如果你知道有三名逃犯被困在哈莱姆区一栋大楼27层的公寓里，即使他们一言不发，你也能知道他们担心两件事：被杀和入狱。+

So, for six straight 连续的 hours 小时 in that sweltering 闷热的 apartment building hallway 走廊, the two FBI negotiating 谈判的 students 学生 and I took turns 轮流 speaking 说话. +

[.my2]
因此，在那栋闷热公寓楼的走廊里，我和两名联邦调查局的谈判学员轮流喊话，持续了六个小时。+

We rotated 轮换 in order to avoid 避免 verbal 言语的 stumbles 失误 and other errors 错误 caused by 由……引起 tiredness 疲劳. +

[.my2]
我们轮换是为了避免因疲劳导致的言语失误和其他错误。+

And we stayed relentlessly 持续地；不懈地 on message 信息, all three of us saying the same thing 事情. +

[.my2]
而且我们始终坚持传递同一个信息，三个人都说着同样的话。+

Now, pay close attention to 密切关注 exactly 确切地 what we said. +

[.my2]
现在，请密切关注我们到底说了什么。+

It looks like you don't want to come out. +

[.my2]
“看起来你们不想出来。”+

It seems like you worry 担心 that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing （枪）猛烈开火. +

[.my2]
“看起来你们担心一旦开门，我们就会持枪冲进来。”+

It looks like you don't want to go back to jail 监狱. +

[.my2]
“看起来你们不想回到监狱里去。”+

We employed 运用 our tactical 战术的 empathy 共情 by recognizing 识别 and then verbalizing 用言语表达 the predictable 可预测的 emotions 情绪 of the situation 情况. +

[.my2]
我们通过识别并能用言语表达这种情况下可预测的情绪，来运用战术共情。+

We didn't just put ourselves in the fugitive 逃犯 shoes 处境；立场（put oneself in someone's shoes 为某人设身处地着想）. +

[.my2]
我们不仅仅是为逃犯设身处地着想。+

We spotted 察觉；发现 their feelings 感受, turned them into words 话语, and then very calmly 平静地 and respectfully 恭敬地 repeated 重复 their emotions back to them. +

[.my2]
我们察觉到他们的感受，将其转化为语言，然后非常平静且恭敬地把这些情绪反馈给他们。+

In a negotiation 谈判, that's called labeling 贴标签. +

[.my2]
在谈判中，这被称为“贴标签”。+

Labeling is a way of validating 证实；确认 someone's emotion 情绪 by acknowledging 承认；认可 it. +

[.my2]
贴标签是通过承认某人的情绪来证实其合理性的一种方式。+

Give someone's emotion a name 名称 and you show you identify with 认同；理解 how that person feels. +

[.my2]
给某人的情绪起个“名字”，就表明你理解那个人的感受。+

It gets you close to 接近 someone without asking about external 外部的 factors 因素 you know nothing about. +

[.my2]
它能让你在不询问那些你一无所知的外部因素的情况下拉近与他人的距离。+

How's your family? Think of labeling as a shortcut 捷径 to intimacy 亲密；亲近. +

[.my2]
比如“你家人怎么样？”可以把贴标签看作是建立亲密关系的捷径。+

A time-saving 节省时间的 emotional 情感的 hack （非正式）技巧；方法. +

[.my2]
一种节省时间的情感技巧。+

Labeling has a special 特别的 advantage 优势 when your counterpart 对方 is tense 紧张的. +

[.my2]
当你的谈判对手处于紧张状态时，贴标签有一个特别的优势。+

Exposing 揭露 negative 负面的 thoughts 想法 to daylight 公开；曝光. +

[.my2]
它能将负面想法公之于众。+

It looks like you don't want to go back to jail makes them seem less frightening 令人害怕的. +

[.my2]
“看起来你们不想回到监狱”这句话会让这些想法看起来不那么可怕。+

In one brain imaging 脑成像 study 研究, two psychology 心理学 professor 教授 Matthew Liberman 马修·利伯曼 of the University of California, Los Angeles 加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校 found that when people are shown photos 照片 of faces 面部 expressing 表达 strong 强烈的 emotion 情绪, the brain shows greater 更大的 activity 活动 in the amygdala 杏仁核（大脑中处理情绪的区域）, the part 部分 that generates 产生 fear 恐惧. +

[.my2]
在一项脑成像研究中，加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校的两位心理学教授马修·利伯曼发现，当人们看到表达强烈情绪的面部照片时，大脑中产生恐惧的区域——杏仁核——会表现出更强烈的活动。+

But when they are asked to label 标注 the emotion, the activity moves to the areas 区域 that govern 支配；控制 rational 理性的 thinking 思考. +

[.my2]
但当他们被要求为这种情绪贴标签时，大脑的活动就会转移到支配理性思考的区域。+

In other words 换句话说, labeling an emotion, applying 运用 rational words 语言 to a fear disrupts 扰乱；破坏 its raw 原始的；未经处理的 intensity 强度. +

[.my2]
换句话说，为情绪贴标签，即用理性的语言来描述恐惧，会削弱恐惧原始的强度。+

Labeling is a simple 简单的, versatile 多功能的；多用途的 skill 技能 that lets you reinforce 加强 a good aspect 方面 of the negotiation 谈判 or diffuse 化解；缓和 a negative 负面的 one, but it has very specific 具体的 rules 规则 about form 形式 and delivery 表达；传递. +

[.my2]
贴标签是一种简单且多功能的技能，它能让你强化谈判中的积极方面，或化解消极方面，但它在形式和表达上有非常具体的规则。+

That makes it less like chatting 聊天 than like a formal 正式的 art 艺术 such as Chinese calligraphy 中国书法. +

[.my2]
这使得它与其说是聊天，不如说是一种像中国书法这样的正式艺术。+

For most people, it's one of the most awkward 尴尬的 negotiating tools 工具 to use. +

[.my2]
对大多数人来说，它是最难使用的谈判工具之一。+

Before they try it the first time, my students 学生 almost always tell me they expect 预期 their counterpart 对方 to jump up 跳起来 and shout 大喊, "Don't you dare 敢 tell me how I feel." Let me let you in on a secret 秘密. +

[.my2]
在第一次尝试之前，我的学生几乎都会告诉我，他们预计对方会跳起来大喊：“你竟敢告诉我我的感受！”让我告诉你一个秘密。+

People never even notice 注意到. +

[.my2]
人们根本不会注意到。+

The first step 步骤 to labeling is detecting 察觉；发现 the other person's emotional 情感的 state 状态. +

[.my2]
贴标签的第一步是察觉对方的情绪状态。+

Outside that door 门 in Harlem, we couldn't even see the fugitives 逃犯. +

在哈莱姆区的那扇门外，我们甚至看不到逃犯。+

But most of the time, you'll have a wealth 大量的 of information 信息 from the other person's words 话语, tone 语气, and body language 肢体语言. +

[.my2]
但大多数时候，你可以从对方的话语、语气和肢体语言中获得大量信息。+

We call that trinity 三位一体 words, music 音乐（此处喻指语气）, and dance 舞蹈（此处喻指肢体语言）. +

[.my2]
我们称之为“三位一体”：话语、语气和肢体语言。+

The trick 技巧 to spotting 发现 feelings 感受 is to pay close attention to 密切关注 changes 变化 people undergo 经历 when they respond to 回应 external 外部的 events 事件. +

[.my2]
察觉情绪的技巧在于密切关注人们在回应外部事件时所发生的变化。+

Most often 通常, those events 事件 are your words 话语. +

[.my2]
这些外部事件通常就是你的话语。+

If you say, "How is the family?" and the corners 角落 of the other party's 另一方的 mouth 嘴 turn down 向下弯 even when they say, "It's great," you might detect 察觉 that all is not well. +

[.my2]
如果你问：“你家人怎么样？”即使对方说“很好”，但嘴角却向下弯，你可能就会察觉到事情并非如此。+

If their voice 声音 goes flat 平淡的 when a colleague 同事 is mentioned 被提到, there could be a problem 问题 between the two. +

[.my2]
如果在提到某个同事时，他们的声音变得平淡，那么两人之间可能存在问题。+

And if your landlord 房东 unconsciously 无意识地 fidgets 坐立不安；烦躁 his feet 脚 when you mention the neighbors 邻居, it's pretty clear 清楚的 that he doesn't think much of 对……评价不高 them. +

[.my2]
如果你在提到邻居时，房东无意识地用脚烦躁地动来动去，那很明显他对邻居评价不高。+

We'll dig deeper into 深入探讨 how to spot 发现 and use these cues 线索 in chapter 9 第9章. +

[.my2]
我们将在第9章深入探讨如何发现和使用这些线索。+

Picking up on 注意到 these tiny 微小的 pieces 碎片；点滴 of information 信息 is how psychics 通灵者 work 工作. +

[.my2]
通灵者的工作方式就是注意到这些微小的信息点。+

They size up 评估；判断 their client's 客户的 body language 肢体语言 and ask him a few innocent 无恶意的 questions 问题. +

[.my2]
他们会评估客户的肢体语言，然后问几个无恶意的问题。+

when they tell his future 未来 a few minutes later, they're really just saying what he wants to hear 想听的 based on 基于 small details 细节 they've spotted 发现. +

[.my2]
几分钟后当他们“预测”客户的未来时，实际上只是根据他们发现的小细节说出客户想听的话。+

More than a few psychics 通灵者 would make good negotiators 谈判者 for that very reason 原因. +

[.my2]
正因为如此，不少通灵者都能成为优秀的谈判者。+

Once 一旦 you've spotted 发现 an emotion 情绪 you want to highlight 强调, the next step 步骤 is to label 标注 it aloud 大声地. +

[.my2]
一旦你发现了一种你想强调的情绪，下一步就是大声地为它贴标签。+

Labels 标签 can be phrased 表达为 as statements 陈述 or questions 问题. +

[.my2]
标签可以以陈述句或疑问句的形式表达。+

The only difference 区别 is whether you end the sentence 句子 with a downward 向下的 or upward 向上的 inflection 语调；声调变化. +

[.my2]
唯一的区别在于句子结尾是用降调还是升调。+

But no matter how they end, labels almost always begin with 以……开头 roughly 大致；差不多 the same words 词语. +

[.my2]
但无论结尾如何，标签几乎总是以大致相同的词语开头。+

It seems like. +

[.my2]
“看起来……”+

It sounds like. +

[.my2]
“听起来……”+

It looks like. +

[.my2]
“看起来……”+

Notice 注意 we said it sounds like and not I'm hearing that. +

[.my2]
请注意，我们说的是“听起来……”，而不是“我听着是那样”。+

That's because the word I gets people's guard up 警惕起来. +

[.my2]
这是因为“我”这个词会让人们提高警惕。+

When you say I, it says you're more interested in 对……感兴趣 yourself than the other person. +

[.my2]
当你说“我”时，就表明你对自己比对对方更感兴趣。+

要不要我帮你整理一份文中核心谈判技巧（战术共情与贴标签）的要点总结？总结会提炼两种技巧的定义、操作方法、科学依据和实战案例，方便你快速掌握这篇内容的核心知识点。

And it makes you take personal responsibility 个人责任 for the words that follow and the offense 冒犯；得罪 they might cause.

[.my2]
这会让你对接下来所说的话以及这些话可能造成的冒犯承担个人责任。

But when you phrase 表述；措辞 a label 标签；标记 as a neutral 中立的；不偏不倚的 statement 陈述；说明 of understanding, it encourages your counterpart 对方；对手 to be responsive 积极回应的；反应积极的.

[.my2]
但当你将一个标签表述为一种中立的理解性陈述时，它会鼓励对方积极回应。

They'll usually give a longer answer than just yes or no.

[.my2]
他们通常会给出一个更长的回答，而不仅仅是“是”或“否”。

And if they disagree with the label, that's okay.

[.my2]
如果他们不认同这个标签，也没关系。

You can always step back 退一步；暂缓 and say, "I didn't say that was what it was.

[.my2]
你随时可以退一步说：“我并没有说事实就是那样。

I just said it seems like that.

[.my2]
我只是说事情看起来像是那样。

The last rule 规则；规定 of labeling is silence 沉默；缄默.

[.my2]
贴标签的最后一条规则是保持沉默。

Once you've thrown out 提出；抛出 a label, be quiet and listen.

[.my2]
一旦你提出了一个标签，就保持安静并倾听。

We all have a tendency 倾向；偏好 to expand on 详述；进一步阐述 what we've said.

[.my2]
我们都倾向于对自己说过的话进行详述。

To finish, it seems like you like the way that shirt looks with a specific 具体的；特定的 question like, "Where did you get it?" But a label's power 力量；影响力 is that it invites 邀请；促使 the other person to reveal 透露；展示 himself.

[.my2]
最后，（如果你想）确认对方是否喜欢那件衬衫的款式，你可能会问一个具体的问题，比如“你在哪儿买的？”但标签的力量在于，它能促使对方主动展现自己。

If you'll trust me for a second 片刻；一会儿, take a break 休息一下 now and try it out.

[.my2]
如果你愿意相信我，现在就休息一下，试试看。

Strike up 开始（交谈） a conversation 交谈；对话 and put a label on one of the other person's emotions 情绪；情感.

[.my2]
开启一段对话，并给对方的某种情绪贴上一个标签。

It doesn't matter if you're talking to the mailman 邮递员 or your 10-year-old daughter.

[.my2]
无论你是在和邮递员说话，还是和你10岁的女儿说话，都可以尝试。

And then go silent 保持沉默.

[.my2]
然后保持沉默。

Let the label do its work 发挥作用.

[.my2]
让标签发挥它的作用。

Neutralize 中和；抵消 the negative 消极的；负面的, reinforce 加强；巩固 the positive 积极的；正面的.

[.my2]
中和消极情绪，巩固积极情绪。

Labeling is a tactic 策略；手段；招数, not a strategy 战略；策略.

[.my2]
贴标签是一种战术，而不是战略。

In the same way a spoon 勺子 is a great tool 工具 for stirring 搅拌 soup 汤, but it's not a recipe 食谱；方法.

[.my2]
这就像勺子是搅拌汤的好工具，但它本身不是食谱一样。

How you use labeling will go a long way in 对……大有帮助 determining 决定；确定 your success 成功.

[.my2]
你如何使用贴标签的方法，将对你的成功大有帮助。

deployed 部署；运用 well.

[.my2]
（如果）运用得当。

It's how we as negotiators 谈判者 identify 识别；确认 and then slowly alter 改变；更改 the inner voices 内心想法；心声 of our counterparts consciousness 意识 to something more collaborative 协作的；合作的 and trusting 信任的.

[.my2]
这就是我们作为谈判者，如何识别并慢慢将对方意识中的内心想法，转变为更具协作性和信任感的想法的方法。

First, let's talk a little human psychology 心理学.

[.my2]
首先，我们来谈谈人类心理学。

In basic terms 从基本层面来说, people's emotions have two levels 层面；层次.

[.my2]
从基本层面来说，人的情绪分为两个层次。

The presenting behavior 外在行为 is the part above the surface 表面 you can see and hear.

[.my2]
外在行为是你能看到和听到的表面部分。

Beneath  在……之下 the underlying feeling 潜在感受 is what motivates 激发；促使 the behavior.

[.my2]
潜在感受隐藏在表面之下，它是行为的驱动力。

Imagine 想象 a grandfather who's grumbly 爱抱怨的；发牢骚的 at a family holiday dinner 家庭节日晚餐.

[.my2]
想象一下，一位祖父在家庭节日晚餐上牢骚满腹。

The presenting behavior is that he's cranky 脾气坏的；易怒的, but the underlying emotion 潜在情绪 is a sad sense of loneliness 孤独感 from his family never seeing him.

[.my2]
他的外在行为是脾气暴躁，但潜在情绪是因家人很少来看他而产生的悲伤孤独感。

What good negotiators do when labeling is address 应对；处理 those underlying emotions.

[.my2]
优秀的谈判者在使用贴标签技巧时，会应对这些潜在情绪。

Labeling negatives 负面事物 diffuses 缓和；平息 them or diffuses them in extreme cases 极端情况.

[.my2]
给负面事物贴标签能缓和它们，在极端情况下也能起到平息作用。

Labeling positives 正面事物 reinforces 加强；巩固 them.

[.my2]
给正面事物贴标签则能巩固它们。

We'll come back to 回到 the cranky grandfather in a moment 片刻之后.

[.my2]
我们稍后再回到那个脾气暴躁的祖父的例子上。

First though, I want to talk a little bit about anger 愤怒.

[.my2]
不过，首先我想谈谈愤怒。

As an emotion, anger is rarely productive 有成效的；有益的 in you or the person you're negotiating with.

[.my2]
作为一种情绪，愤怒对你或与你谈判的人来说，几乎没有任何益处。

It releases 释放 stress hormones 压力荷尔蒙 and neurochemicals 神经化学物质 that disrupt 干扰；破坏 your ability 能力 to properly evaluate 评估 and respond to 应对 situations, and it blinds 使失明；使无法看清 you to the fact that you're angry in the first place 起初；首先, which gives you a false sense of confidence 虚假的自信感.

[.my2]
它会释放压力荷尔蒙和神经化学物质，干扰你正确评估和应对情况的能力，还会让你一开始就意识不到自己在生气，从而产生一种虚假的自信感。

That's not to say that negative feelings 负面感受 should be ignored 忽视；忽略.

[.my2]
这并不是说负面感受应该被忽视。

That can be just as damaging 有害的；有破坏性的.

[.my2]
忽视它们同样可能造成伤害。

Instead, they should be teased out 逐渐引出；梳理清楚.

[.my2]
相反，应该把它们逐渐梳理清楚。

Labeling is a helpful tactic in deescalating 缓和；降温 angry confrontations 对抗；冲突 because it makes the person acknowledge 承认；认可 their feelings rather than continuing to act out 发泄；表现出（不良情绪）.

[.my2]
贴标签是缓和愤怒冲突的有效策略，因为它能让对方承认自己的感受，而不是继续发泄情绪。

Early on 早期；刚开始 in my hostage negotiation 人质谈判 career 职业生涯, I learned how important it was to go directly at 直面 negative dynamics 负面态势 in a fearless 无畏的；勇敢的 but differential 尊重的；恭敬的 manner 方式；态度.

[.my2]
在我人质谈判职业生涯的早期，我就认识到，以无畏但尊重的态度直面负面态势是多么重要。

It was to fix 解决 a situation I'd created myself.

[.my2]
这源于我需要解决一个自己造成的局面。

I'd angered 惹恼 the top FBI official 高级联邦调查局官员 in Canada when I entered the country without first alerting 通知；告知 him so he could notify 通知 the Department of State 国务院, a procedure 程序；手续 known as country clearance 国家许可.

[.my2]
我在进入加拿大时，没有事先通知当地的高级联邦调查局官员，以便他能告知国务院——这一程序被称为“国家许可”，因此我惹恼了他。

I knew I needed to call and assuage 安抚；缓和 him to straighten out 解决；理清 the situation or I risked 冒着……的风险 being expelled 驱逐；赶走.

[.my2]
我知道我必须打电话安抚他，以解决这个问题，否则我可能会被驱逐出境。

Top guys 高层人士 like to feel on top 处于优势地位；掌控局面.

[.my2]
高层人士喜欢感觉自己处于掌控地位。

They don't want to be disrespected 不被尊重.

[.my2]
他们不希望被不尊重。

All the more so 尤其；更加 when the office 职位；公职 they run isn't a sexy assignment 有吸引力的任务.

[.my2]
尤其是当他们负责的职位并非一份有吸引力的差事时。

Bless me, father, for I have sinned 忏悔语：神父，宽恕我，我有罪, I said when he answered the phone.

[.my2]
他接电话时，我说：“神父，宽恕我，我有罪。”

There was a long pause 停顿 at the other end of the line 电话那头.

[.my2]
电话那头沉默了很久。

Who is this? He said, "Bless me, father, for I have sinned," I repeated 重复.

[.my2]
“你是谁？”他问。“神父，宽恕我，我有罪。”我重复道。

"It's Chris Voss." Again, there was a long silence 沉默.

[.my2]
“我是克里斯·沃斯。”电话那头再次陷入了长时间的沉默。

Does your boss know you're here? I said he did and crossed my fingers 交叉手指（祈求好运）.

[.my2]
“你的老板知道你在这里吗？”我说他知道，并交叉手指祈求好运。

At this point 此刻；在这一点上, the FBI official would have been completely within his rights 完全有权 to tell me to leave Canada immediately 立即.

[.my2]
此刻，这位联邦调查局官员完全有权让我立即离开加拿大。

But by mentioning 提及 the negative dynamic, I knew I diffused 缓和；平息 it as much as I could.

[.my2]
但通过提及这种负面态势，我知道我已经尽我所能缓和了局面。

I had a chance 机会.

[.my2]
我有了一个机会。

"All right, you've got country clearance," he finally said.

[.my2]
“好吧，你获得了国家许可，”他最终说道。

"I'll take care of 处理 the paperwork 文书工作." Try this the next time you have to apologize for 为……道歉 a boneheaded mistake 愚蠢的错误.

[.my2]
“我会处理好文书工作。”下次你需要为一个愚蠢的错误道歉时，试试这个方法。

Go right at it 直面它.

[.my2]
直面问题本身。

The fastest and most efficient 高效的 means 方法 of establishing 建立 a quick working relationship 工作关系 is to acknowledge 承认 the negative and diffuse it.

[.my2]
建立快速工作关系的最快、最高效的方法，就是承认负面问题并缓和它。

Whenever I was dealing with 与……打交道 the family of a hostage, I started out by 以……开始 saying I knew they were scared 害怕的.

[.my2]
每当我与 hostage 的家人打交道时，我都会先开口说我知道他们很害怕。

And when I make a mistake, something that happens a lot, I always acknowledge the other person's anger 愤怒.

[.my2]
而且当我犯错时——这种事经常发生——我总会承认对方的愤怒。

I found the phrase 短语, "Look, I'm an asshole 混蛋；蠢货," to be an amazingly effective 极其有效的 way to make problems go away 解决问题.

[.my2]
我发现“听着，我是个混蛋”这句话，是解决问题的一种极其有效的方式。

That approach 方法 has never failed me.

[.my2]
这种方法从未让我失望过。

Let's go back to 回到 the cranky grandfather.

[.my2]
让我们回到那个脾气暴躁的祖父的例子。

He's grumpy 脾气坏的 because he never sees the family and he feels left out 被冷落；被忽视.

[.my2]
他之所以脾气暴躁，是因为他很少见到家人，而且感觉自己被冷落了。

So, he's speaking up 直言不讳；大声说 in his own dysfunctional 不正常的；功能失调的 way to get attention 引起注意.

[.my2]
所以，他用自己那种不太正常的方式直言不讳，只为引起注意。

How do you fix 解决 that? Instead of addressing 应对 his grumpy behavior, you acknowledge 承认 his sadness 悲伤 in a non-judgmental 不带评判的 way.

[.my2]
你该如何解决这个问题呢？不要去应对他暴躁的行为，而是以一种不带评判的方式承认他的悲伤。

You head him off 阻止；使改变方向 before he can really get started 真正开始.

[.my2]
在他真正开始发脾气之前，你就先阻止他。

We don't see each other all that often 经常, you could say.

[.my2]
你可以说：“我们不常见面啊。

It seems like you feel like we don't pay any attention to 关注 you and you only see us once a year, so why should you make time for 腾出时间给 us? Notice how that acknowledges the situation and labels his sadness.

[.my2]
看起来你觉得我们都不关注你，而且你一年才见我们一次，所以你为什么要为我们腾出时间呢？”注意，这样说既承认了现状，也给了他的悲伤贴上了标签。

Here, you can pause briefly 短暂地停顿, letting him recognize 意识到 and appreciate 感激 your attempts 尝试 to understand what he's feeling and then turn the situation around 扭转局面 by offering 提出 a positive solution 积极的解决方案.

[.my2]
这时，你可以短暂停顿一下，让他意识到并感激你试图理解他的感受，然后通过提出一个积极的解决方案来扭转局面。

For us, this is a real treat 乐事；享受.

[.my2]
“对我们来说，这真是一件乐事。

We want to hear what you have to talk about.

[.my2]
我们想听你说说你的事情。

We want to value 珍惜 this time with you because we feel left out of 被排除在……之外 your life.

[.my2]
我们想珍惜和你在一起的这段时间，因为我们感觉自己被排除在你的生活之外了。”

Research shows that the best way to deal with 应对 negativity 消极情绪 is to observe 观察 it without reaction 反应 and without judgment 评判.

[.my2]
研究表明，应对消极情绪的最佳方式是不加反应、不加评判地观察它。

Then consciously 有意识地 label each negative feeling and replace 替换 it with positive, compassionate 有同情心的, and solution-based 以解决方案为导向的 thoughts 想法.

[.my2]
然后有意识地给每种负面感受贴上标签，并用积极、富有同情心且以解决方案为导向的想法来取代它。

One of my Georgetown University 乔治城大学 students, a guy named TJ, who worked as an assistant controller 助理财务总监 at the Washington Redskins 华盛顿红皮队（美国橄榄球队）, put that lesson 经验；教训 to work while he was taking my negotiations class.

[.my2]
我的一个乔治城大学的学生，一个名叫TJ的人，他在华盛顿红皮队担任助理财务总监。在他上我的谈判课时，就把这个经验付诸了实践。

The economy 经济 was in the toilet 处境糟糕；一塌糊涂 at the time, and Redskins season ticket holders 季票持有者 were leaving in droves 成群结队地 to avoid 避免 the cost 费用.

[.my2]
当时经济状况一塌糊涂，红皮队的季票持有者为了节省开支，成群结队地放弃了购票。

Worse 更糟糕的是, the team had been terrible 糟糕的 the year before, and off-field 场外的 player problems 球员问题 were alienating 使疏远 the fans 球迷.

[.my2]
更糟糕的是，这支球队前一年的表现很糟糕，而且球员的场外问题也让球迷们感到疏远。

The team's CFO 首席财务官 was getting more worried 担忧的 and cranky 脾气坏的 by the day 日益；一天比一天.

[.my2]
球队的首席财务官一天比一天更焦虑、更暴躁。

And two weeks before the season was to start 赛季开始前, he walked by TJ's desk and slammed down 猛地放下 a folder 文件夹 full of paper.

[.my2]
在赛季开始前两周，他走过TJ的办公桌，猛地放下一个装满文件的文件夹。

"Better yesterday than today," he said and walked away.

[.my2]
“昨天做总比今天做好，”他说完就走开了。

Inside was a list of 40 seasoned ticket holders 资深票持有者 who hadn't paid their bills 账单, a USB drive U盘 with a spreadsheet 电子表格 about each one's situation, and a script 脚本；话术 to use when calling them.

[.my2]
文件夹里有一份40名未付款的资深票持有者的名单、一个存有每个人情况电子表格的U盘，以及一份打电话时要用的话术脚本。

TJ saw right away 立刻 that the script was a disaster 灾难；糟透的事.

[.my2]
TJ立刻就看出这份话术脚本糟透了。

It began by saying that his colleagues 同事 had been trying to call for months 好几个月 and the account 账户 had been escalated to 升级到；提交给 him.

[.my2]
脚本一开始就说，他的同事已经尝试联系（这些人）好几个月了，现在这个账户问题已经提交给了他。

I wanted to inform 通知 you, it read, that in order to receive your tickets for the upcoming 即将到来的 season opener 赛季揭幕战 against 对阵 the New York Giants 纽约巨人队, you will need to pay your outstanding balance 未结清余额 in full 全额 prior to 在……之前 September 10.

[.my2]
脚本上写着：“我想通知您，为了获得即将到来的对阵纽约巨人队的赛季揭幕战门票，您需要在9月10日之前全额支付未结清的余额。”

It was the stupidly aggressive 愚蠢地咄咄逼人的, impersonal 冷漠的；无人情味的, tonedeaf 听觉不灵敏的；反应迟钝的 style of communication 沟通方式 that is the default 默认的 for most business.

[.my2]
这是一种愚蠢地咄咄逼人、冷漠且反应迟钝的沟通方式，却是大多数企业的默认选择。

It was all me me from TJ with no acknowledgement 承认 of the ticket holder situation, no empathy 同理心, no connection 联系.

[.my2]
整段话都以TJ的视角出发，没有承认票持有者的处境，没有同理心，也没有建立任何联系。

Just give me the money.

[.my2]
核心意思就是“把钱给我”。

Maybe I don't need to say it.

[.my2]
或许我不用说也知道结果。

But the script didn't work 起作用.

[.my2]
但这份脚本根本没用。

TJ left messages 留言.

[.my2]
TJ留言了。

No one called back 回电话.

[.my2]
没有人回电话。

A few weeks into 进入……几周后 the class, TJ rewrote 重写 the script.

[.my2]
上课几周后，TJ重写了这份脚本。

These weren't massive changes 巨大的改变, and he didn't offer 提供 the fans any discounts 折扣.

[.my2]
这些改动并不大，他也没有给球迷提供任何折扣。

What he did was add subtle tweaks 细微的调整 to make the call about the fans, their situation, and their love of the team.

[.my2]
他所做的只是做了一些细微的调整，让这通电话的焦点放在球迷、他们的处境以及他们对球队的热爱上。

Now, the team was your Washington Redskins.

[.my2]
现在，球队变成了“你们的华盛顿红皮队”。

And the purpose 目的 of the call was to ensure 确保 that the team's most valuable 有价值的 fans, the delinquent customers 拖欠款项的客户, would be there at the season opener.

[.my2]
而打电话的目的是确保球队最有价值的球迷——也就是这些拖欠款项的客户——能到场观看赛季揭幕战。

The home field advantage 主场优势 created by you each and every Sunday at FedEx Field 联邦快递球场 does not go unnoticed 被忽视, TJ wrote.

[.my2]
TJ写道：“每个周日，你们在联邦快递球场创造的主场优势，我们都看在眼里。”

He then told them, "In these difficult times 困难时期, we understand our fans have been hit hard 遭受重创 and we are here to work with 与……合作 you and ask the ticket holders to call back to talk through 详细讨论 their unique situation 独特情况.

[.my2]
然后他告诉他们：“在这些困难时期，我们知道球迷们都遭受了重创，我们愿意与你们合作，希望票持有者能回电话，详细讨论他们的具体情况。

Though superficially 表面上 simple, the changes TJ made in the script had a deep emotional resonance 情感共鸣 with the delinquent ticket holders.

[.my2]
尽管从表面上看很简单，但TJ在脚本中做的改动，与那些拖欠款项的票持有者产生了深刻的情感共鸣。

It mentioned 提及 their debt 债务 to the team, but also acknowledged 承认 the team's debt to them.

[.my2]
脚本中既提到了他们对球队的欠款，也承认了球队对他们的亏欠。

And by labeling the tough economic times 艰难的经济时期 and the stress 压力 they were causing, it diffused 缓和；平息 the biggest negative dynamic 负面态势, their delinquency 拖欠行为, and turned the issue 问题 into something solvable 可解决的.

[.my2]
而且通过给艰难的经济时期以及这些时期带来的压力贴上标签，脚本缓和了最大的负面态势——他们的拖欠行为，并将这个问题转变成了一个可解决的事情。

The simple changes masked 掩盖；隐藏 a complex understanding 复杂的理解 of empathy 同理心 on TJ's side.

[.my2]
这些简单的改动背后，隐藏着TJ对同理心的复杂理解。

With the new script, TJ was able to set up 建立 payment plans 付款计划 with all the ticket holders before the Giants game.

[.my2]
有了新的脚本，TJ在对阵巨人队的比赛前，成功与所有票持有者都制定了付款计划。

and the CFO's next visit 到访.

[.my2]
而首席财务官的下次到访（情况就大不一样了）。

Well, it was far less tur clear the road before advertising the destination.

[.my2]
嗯，情况要明朗得多——就像在宣传目的地之前先清理好道路一样。

Remember the amygdala 杏仁核, the part of the brain 大脑部位 that generates 产生 fear 恐惧 in reaction to 对……的反应 threats 威胁? Well, the faster we can interrupt 打断 the amygdala's reaction to real or imaginary 想象中的 threats, the faster we can clear the road of obstacles 障碍 and the quicker we can generate 产生 feelings of safety 安全感, well-being 幸福感, and trust 信任感.

[.my2]
还记得杏仁核吗？它是大脑中对威胁做出反应并产生恐惧的部位。我们越快能打断杏仁核对真实或想象中的威胁的反应，就能越快清除道路上的障碍，也就能越快产生安全感、幸福感和信任感。

We do that by labeling the fears.

[.my2]
我们通过给恐惧贴标签来做到这一点。

These labels are so powerful 有力的 because they bathe 沉浸；笼罩 the fears in sunlight 阳光, bleaching 去除；削弱 them of their power and showing our counterpart 对方 that we understand.

[.my2]
这些标签之所以如此有力，是因为它们让恐惧暴露在阳光下，削弱了恐惧的力量，同时也向对方表明我们理解他们。

Think back to 回想 that Harlem landing.

[.my2]
回想一下哈莱姆区的那次（谈判）。

I didn't say it seems like you want us to let you go.

[.my2]
我没有说“看起来你们想让我们放你们走”。

We could all agree on 同意 that.

[.my2]
这一点我们都能认同。

But that wouldn't have diffused 缓和 the real fear in the apartment or shown that I empathized with 共情；同理心 the grim 严峻的 complexity 复杂性 of their situation.

[.my2]
但那样做无法缓和公寓里真正的恐惧，也无法表明我对他们处境的严峻复杂性抱有同理心。

That's why I went right at 直面 the amygdala and said, "It seems like you don't want to go back to jail 监狱." Once they've been labeled and brought into the open 公开；暴露, the negative reactions 负面反应 in your counterparts amydala will begin to soften 缓和；减弱.

[.my2]
这就是为什么我直面（他们的）杏仁核，说：“看起来你们不想回到监狱里去。”一旦恐惧被贴上标签并暴露出来，对方杏仁核产生的负面反应就会开始缓和。

I promise 保证 it will shock 使震惊 you how suddenly his language turns from worry 担忧 to optimism 乐观.

[.my2]
我保证，你会惊讶地发现，他的语气会突然从担忧变得乐观。

Empathy 同理心 is a powerful mood enhancer 情绪增强剂.

[.my2]
同理心是一种强大的情绪增强剂。

The road is not always cleared 清理 so easily, so don't be demoralized 使士气低落 if this process 过程 seems to go slowly 进展缓慢.

[.my2]
道路并不总是能轻易清理干净，所以如果这个过程看起来进展缓慢，不要士气低落。

The Harlem high-rise 高层大楼 negotiation took 6 hours.

[.my2]
哈莱姆区高层大楼的那次谈判花了6个小时。

Many of us wear fears upon fears like layers 层 against the cold.

[.my2]
我们很多人会被层层恐惧包裹，就像穿了多层衣服抵御寒冷一样。

So getting to safety 安全 takes time 花费时间.

[.my2]
所以要达到安全的状态需要时间。

That was the experience 经历 of another one of my students, a fundraiser 筹款人 for the Girl Scouts 女童子军, who backed into 无意中做到 naming her counterparts fears almost accidentally 几乎意外地.

[.my2]
我的另一个学生也有过这样的经历，她是女童子军的一名筹款人，几乎是意外地无意中说出了对方的恐惧。

We're not talking about someone who sold Girl Scout cookies 女童子军饼干.

[.my2]
我们说的不是那种卖女童子军饼干的人。

My student was an experienced 有经验的 fundraiser who regularly 经常 got donors 捐赠者 to pony up 拿出（钱） $1,000 to $25,000 a check 一张支票.

[.my2]
我的学生是一位经验丰富的筹款人，她经常能让捐赠者开出1000到25000美元的支票。

Over the years 多年来, she'd developed 形成；建立 a very successful system 体系 to get her clients 客户, usually wealthy women 有钱的女人, to open their checkbook 支票簿.

[.my2]
多年来，她形成了一套非常成功的体系，能让她的客户——通常是有钱的女性——愿意打开她们的支票簿（捐款）。

She'd invite 邀请 a potential donor 潜在捐赠者 to her office, serve 提供 a few Girl Scouts cookies, walk her through 带领……浏览 an album 相册 of heartwarming 感人的 snapshots 快照 and handwritten letters 手写信 from projects 项目 that match 匹配 the woman's profile 个人情况, and then collect 收取 a check when the donor's eyes lit up 眼睛一亮（表示感兴趣）.

[.my2]
她会邀请一位潜在捐赠者到她的办公室，提供一些女童子军饼干，带领对方浏览一本相册，里面是与这位女性个人情况相符的项目的感人快照和手写信。然后在捐赠者眼睛一亮（表示感兴趣）时，收取支票。

It was almost easy.

[.my2]
这几乎毫不费力。

One day though, she met the immovable donor 固执的捐赠者.

[.my2]
然而有一天，她遇到了一位固执的捐赠者。

Once the woman sat down in her office, my student began to throw out 提出 the projects her research 研究 had said would fit 合适.

[.my2]
这位女士一在她的办公室坐下，我的学生就开始提出她研究过的、认为合适的项目。

But the woman shook her head 摇头 at one project after another.

[.my2]
但这位女士对一个又一个项目都摇了摇头。

My student found herself growing perplexed 困惑的 at the difficult donor who had no interest in donating 捐赠.

[.my2]
我的学生对这位对捐赠毫无兴趣的难缠捐赠者感到越来越困惑。

But she held her emotion in check 控制情绪 and reached back to 回想 a lesson 经验 from my recent class 最近的课 on labeling.

[.my2]
但她控制住了自己的情绪，回想起了我最近课上讲的关于贴标签的经验。

"I'm sensing 感觉到 some hesitation 犹豫 with these projects," she said in what she hoped was a level 平稳的 voice.

[.my2]
“我感觉你对这些项目有些犹豫，”她用一种她希望是平稳的语气说道。

As if she'd been uncorked 打开瓶塞（比喻畅所欲言）, the woman exclaimed 大声说, "I want my gift 捐赠物 to directly support 直接支持 programming 项目活动 for Girl Scouts and not anything else." This helped focus 聚焦 the conversation.

[.my2]
那位女士仿佛打开了话匣子，大声说道：“我希望我的捐赠能直接支持女童子军的项目活动，而不是其他任何东西。”这帮助聚焦了谈话内容。

But as my student put forth 提出 project after project that seemed to fulfill 满足 the donor's criteria 标准, all she got was still rejection 拒绝.

[.my2]
但当我的学生提出一个又一个似乎符合捐赠者标准的项目时，得到的仍然全是拒绝。

Sensing 感觉到 the potential donor's growing frustration 沮丧 and wanting to end on a positive note 以积极的方式结束 so that they might be able to meet again 再次见面, my student used another label.

[.my2]
感觉到这位潜在捐赠者越来越沮丧，我的学生希望能以积极的方式结束谈话，以便他们将来还能见面，于是她又用了一个标签。

It seems that you are really passionate about 对……充满热情 this gift and want to find the right project reflecting 反映 the opportunities 机会 and life-changing experiences 改变人生的经历 the Girl Scouts gave you.

[.my2]
“看起来你对这份捐赠充满了热情，希望找到一个合适的项目，能够反映出女童子军给你的机会和那些改变人生的经历。”

And with that, this difficult woman signed 签署 a check without even picking 挑选 a specific 具体的 project.

[.my2]
说完这话，这位难缠的女士甚至没有挑选具体的项目，就签了一张支票。

You understand me, she said as she got up to leave.

[.my2]
“你理解我，”她起身离开时说道。

I trust 信任 you'll find the right project.

[.my2]
“我相信你会找到合适的项目。”

Fear of her money being misappropriated 挪用 was the presenting dynamic 表面态势 that the first label uncovered 揭示；发现.

[.my2]
担心自己的钱被挪用，是第一个标签揭示出的表面态势。

But the second label uncovered the underlying dynamic 潜在态势.

[.my2]
但第二个标签揭示出了潜在态势。

Her very presence 在场 in the office was driven by 由……驱动 very specific memories 具体的回忆 of being a little girl scout and how it changed her life.

[.my2]
她之所以会出现在办公室，是由她作为小女童子军时的那些非常具体的回忆，以及女童子军如何改变了她的人生所驱动的。

The obstacle 障碍 here wasn't finding the right match 匹配 for the woman.

[.my2]
这里的障碍不在于为这位女士找到合适的（项目）匹配。

It wasn't that she was this highly finicky 过分挑剔的, hard-to- donor 难对付的捐赠者.

[.my2]
也不在于她是一个过分挑剔、难以对付的捐赠者。

The real obstacle was that this woman needed to feel that she was understood 被理解.

[.my2]
真正的障碍在于，这位女士需要感觉到自己被理解。

That the person handling 处理 her money knew why she was in that office and understood the memories 回忆 that were driving 驱动 her actions 行动.

[.my2]
她需要让处理她捐款的人知道她为什么会在那个办公室，并且理解驱动她行动的那些回忆。

That's why labels are so powerful 有力的 and so potentially transformative 具有变革性的 to the state of any conversation 谈话状态.

[.my2]
这就是为什么标签对任何谈话的状态都如此有力，且具有潜在的变革性。

By digging beneath 挖掘……的深层 what seems like a mountain of quibbles 一大堆吹毛求疵的意见, details 细节, and logistics 后勤；流程, labels help to uncover 揭示 and identify 识别 the primary emotion 主要情绪 driving 驱动 almost all of your counterparts behavior 对方行为.

[.my2]
通过挖掘那些看似一大堆的吹毛求疵的意见、细节和流程背后的深层原因，标签有助于揭示和识别驱动对方几乎所有行为的主要情绪。

The emotion that once acknowledged 承认 seems to miraculously 奇迹般地 solve 解决 everything else.

[.my2]
这种情绪一旦被承认，似乎就能奇迹般地解决其他所有问题。

Do an accusation audit 指责审核.

[.my2]
进行一次“指责审核”。

On the first day of negotiating class each semester 学期, I march 带领 the group through 完成 an introductory exercise 入门练习 called 60 seconds or she dies.

[.my2]
每个学期谈判课的第一天，我都会带领学生们完成一个名为“60秒内不放人她就死”的入门练习。

I play 扮演 a hostage taker 劫持人质者 and a student has to convince 说服 me to release 释放 my hostage 人质 within a minute 一分钟内.

[.my2]
我扮演劫持人质者，一名学生必须在一分钟内说服我释放人质。

It's an icebreaker 破冰活动 that shows me the level 水平 of my students and it reveals to 向……揭示 them how much they need to learn.

[.my2]
这是一个破冰活动，既能让我了解学生们的水平，也能让他们明白自己还有很多需要学习的东西。

Here's a little secret 秘密.

[.my2]
这里有个小秘密。

The hostage never gets out 出来.

[.my2]
人质从来没有被释放过。


Sometimes students jump right in, but finding takers 接受者；承担者 is usually hard because it means coming to the front of the class and competing with the guy who holds all the cards 占尽优势；掌握一切主动权.

[.my2]
有时学生会直接参与，但找到愿意接受（这个任务）的人通常很难，因为这意味着要走到教室前面，和那个占尽优势的人竞争。

If I just ask for a volunteer 志愿者, my students sit on their hands 袖手旁观；不愿帮忙 and look away.

[.my2]
如果我只是简单地找志愿者，学生们就会袖手旁观，把头扭向一边。

You've been there.

[.my2]
你肯定也有过这样的经历。

You can almost feel your back muscles tense 绷紧 as you think, "Oh, please don't call on me." So, I don't ask.

[.my2]
你几乎能感觉到自己的背部肌肉在绷紧，心里想着：“哦，求求你别叫我。”所以，我不会直接问。

Instead, I say, "In case you're worried about volunteering to roleplay 角色扮演 with me in front of the class, I want to tell you in advance 提前.

[.my2]
相反，我说：“如果你们担心在全班同学面前和我进行角色扮演，我想提前告诉你们。

It's going to be horrible 糟糕的；可怕的." After the laughter dies down 渐渐平息, I then say, "And those of you who do volunteer will probably get more out of this than anyone else.

[.my2]
这肯定会很糟糕。”在笑声渐渐平息后，我接着说：“而那些愿意做志愿者的人，可能会比其他人从中学到更多。

I always end up with 最终有 more volunteers than I need.

[.my2]
最后，我得到的志愿者总是比我需要的多。

Now, look at what I did." I prefaced 为……作序；以……开头 the conversation by labeling my audience's fears.

[.my2]
现在，看看我做了什么。”我通过给听众的恐惧贴标签，为这场对话作了铺垫。

How much worse can something be than horrible? I diffuse 缓和；平息 them and wait, letting it sink in 被充分理解；被完全领会 and thereby 因此；从而 making the unreasonable 不合理的 seem less forbidding 令人生畏的.

[.my2]
还有什么能比“糟糕”更糟呢？我缓和了他们的情绪，然后等待，让这个想法被充分理解，从而让那些不合理的担忧看起来不那么令人生畏。

All of us have intuitively 直觉地 done something close to this thousands of times.

[.my2]
我们所有人都凭直觉做过成千上万次类似的事情。

You'll start a criticism 批评；指责 of a friend by saying, "I don't want this to sound harsh 严厉的；刺耳的." Hoping that whatever comes next will be softened 缓和；减轻.

[.my2]
你在批评朋友时，会先开口说：“我不想让这话听起来太刺耳。”希望接下来要说的话能缓和一些。

Or you'll say, "I don't want to seem like an asshole 混蛋；蠢货." hoping your counterpart 对方 will tell you a few sentences later that you're not that bad.

[.my2]
或者你会说：“我不想显得像个混蛋。”希望对方过一会儿会告诉你，你其实没那么差。

The small but critical 关键的 mistake this commits 犯（错） is denying 否认 the negative 负面事物.

[.my2]
这种做法所犯的一个微小但关键的错误，就是否认负面事物的存在。

That actually gives it credence 可信度；相信.

[.my2]
这实际上反而让负面事物更可信了。

In court 法庭, defense lawyers 辩护律师 do this properly by mentioning 提及 everything their client 当事人 is accused of 被指控 and all the weaknesses 弱点 of their case 案件 in the opening statement 开场陈述.

[.my2]
在法庭上，辩护律师会恰当地处理这件事：他们在开场陈述中会提及当事人被指控的所有罪名，以及他们案件中的所有弱点。

They call this technique 技巧 taking the sting out 消除刺痛；缓和冲击.

[.my2]
他们把这种技巧称为“消除刺痛”。

What I want to do here is turn this into a process 过程 that applied systematically 系统地应用, you can use to disarm 解除武装；使无害 your counterpart while negotiating everything from your son's bedtime 就寝时间 to large business contracts 商业合同.

[.my2]
我在这里想做的，是把这变成一个可以系统应用的流程。无论是和你儿子协商就寝时间，还是谈判大型商业合同，你都可以用它来化解对方的敌意。

The first step 步骤 of doing so is listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you in what I call an accusation audit 指责审核.

[.my2]
要做到这一点，第一步是列出对方可能对你提出的所有负面指责，我把这叫做“指责审核”。

This idea of an accusation audit is really, really hard for people to get their minds around 理解；领会.

[.my2]
“指责审核”这个概念对人们来说真的很难理解。

The first time I tell my students about it, they say, "Oh my god, we can't do that.

[.my2]
我第一次告诉学生们这个概念时，他们会说：“哦，我的天，我们做不到。

It seems both artificial 做作的；不自然的 and self-loathing 自我厌恶的.

[.my2]
这看起来既做作又让人自我厌恶。

It seems like it would make things worse." But then I remind 提醒 them that it's exactly what I did the first day of class when I labeled their fears of the hostage game 人质游戏 in advance 提前.

[.my2]
这似乎会让事情变得更糟。”但随后我会提醒他们，这正是我在上课第一天所做的——我提前给他们对人质游戏的恐惧贴了标签。

And they all admit 承认 that none of them knew.

[.my2]
他们都承认，当时没有人意识到这一点。

As an example, I'm going to use the experience 经历 of one of my students, Anna, because I couldn't be more proud 自豪的 at how she turned what she learned in my class into $1 million.

[.my2]
举个例子，我想讲讲我的一个学生安娜的经历，因为我为她把在我课上学到的知识转化成100万美元而感到无比自豪。

At the time, Anna was representing 代表 a major government contractor 政府承包商.

[.my2]
当时，安娜代表着一家大型政府承包商。

Her firm 公司 had won a competition 竞标 for a sizable 相当大的 government deal 政府项目 by partnering with 与……合作 a smaller company, let's call it ABC Corp., whose CEO 首席执行官 had a close relationship 密切关系 with the government client representative 政府客户代表.

[.my2]
她的公司通过与一家较小的公司（我们暂且称之为ABC公司）合作，赢得了一个相当大的政府项目竞标。ABC公司的首席执行官与政府客户代表关系密切。

Problems started right after they won the contract 合同.

[.my2]
他们赢得合同后，问题马上就出现了。

Though, because ABC's relationship had been instrumental 起重要作用的 in winning the deal, ABC felt that it was owed a piece of the pie 应得的一份利益, whether it fulfilled 履行 its part of the contract or not.

[.my2]
不过，由于ABC公司的关系在赢得项目中起了重要作用，该公司认为，无论自己是否履行了合同中的职责，都应该得到一份利益。

And so, while the contract paid them for the work of nine people, they continually 持续地 cut back 削减 support 支持.

[.my2]
因此，尽管合同为九个人的工作量支付了报酬，但他们却持续削减支持人员。

As Anna's company had to perform 完成 ABC's work, the relationship between ABC and Anna's company fragmented 破裂 into vituperative 辱骂的；诽谤的 emails 电子邮件 and bitter 激烈的 complaining 抱怨.

[.my2]
由于安娜的公司不得不承担ABC公司的工作，两家公司的关系破裂，陷入了互相发送辱骂邮件和激烈抱怨的境地。

Facing an already low profit margin 利润率, Anna's company was forced into tough negotiations 艰难的谈判 to get ABC to take a cut 削减 to five people.

[.my2]
面对本已很低的利润率，安娜的公司被迫进行艰难的谈判，要求ABC公司将人员削减到五人。

The negotiations left a bitter aftertaste 不愉快的余味 on both sides 双方.

[.my2]
这次谈判给双方都留下了不愉快的余味。

The vituperative emails stopped, but then again, all emails stopped and no communication 沟通 is always a bad sign 迹象.

[.my2]
辱骂性的邮件停止了，但紧接着，所有邮件往来都中断了——而没有沟通向来都是个坏迹象。

A few months after those painful 痛苦的 talks 谈判, the client 客户 demanded 要求 a major rethink 重新考虑 on the project 项目 and Anna's firm was faced with 面临 losing serious money 损失大笔资金 if it didn't get ABC to agree to further cuts 进一步削减.

[.my2]
在那些痛苦的谈判过去几个月后，客户要求对项目进行重大重新评估。如果不能让ABC公司同意进一步削减人员，安娜的公司将面临大笔资金损失。

Because ABC wasn't living up to 履行 its side of the bargain 协议；约定, Anna's firm would have had strong contractual grounds 合同依据 to cut out 剔除 ABC altogether 完全.

[.my2]
由于ABC公司没有履行协议中的义务，安娜的公司本有充分的合同依据将其完全剔除。

But that would have damaged 损害 Anna's firm's reputation 声誉 with a very important customer 客户 and could have led to litigation 诉讼 from ABC.

[.my2]
但这会损害安娜的公司在一位非常重要客户心中的声誉，还可能引发ABC公司的诉讼。

Faced with this scenario 情况；局面, Anna set up 安排 a meeting 会议 with ABC where she and her partners 伙伴 planned to inform 通知 ABC that its pay 报酬 was being cut to three people.

[.my2]
面对这种情况，安娜安排了与ABC公司的会议，她和她的伙伴们计划在会上通知ABC公司，将其报酬对应的人员削减到三人。

It was a touchy 敏感的；难处理的 situation 情况 as ABC was already unhappy about the first cut.

[.my2]
这是一个敏感的局面，因为ABC公司已经对第一次削减感到不满了。

Even though she was normally 通常 an aggressive 积极进取的 and confident 自信的 negotiator 谈判者, worries about the negotiations ruined 毁掉 Anna's sleep for weeks 好几周.

[.my2]
尽管安娜通常是一个积极自信的谈判者，但对这次谈判的担忧让她好几周都睡不好觉。

She needed to extract 获取 concessions 让步 while improving the relationship 关系 at the same time.

[.my2]
她需要在改善关系的同时获取让步。

No easy task 任务, right? To prepare 准备, the first thing Anna did was sit down with her negotiating partner 谈判伙伴, Mark, and list 列出 every negative charge 负面指责 that ABC could level at 向……提出（指责） them.

[.my2]
这可不是件容易的事，对吧？为了准备，安娜做的第一件事就是和她的谈判伙伴马克坐下来，列出ABC公司可能对他们提出的每一项负面指责。

The relationship had gone sour 变糟 long before, so the list was huge 庞大的.

[.my2]
两家公司的关系早就变糟了，所以清单很长。

But the biggest possible accusations 指责 were easy to spot 识别；发现.

[.my2]
但最可能出现的那些主要指责很容易识别。

You are the typical 典型的 prime contractor 总承包商 trying to force out 排挤 the small guy 小企业.

[.my2]
“你们就是典型的总承包商，想排挤小企业。”

You promised 承诺 us we would have all this work, and you reneged on 违背（承诺） your promise.

[.my2]
“你们承诺过这些工作都归我们做，现在却违背了承诺。”

You could have told us about this issue 问题 weeks ago to help us prepare 准备.

[.my2]
“你们本可以几周前就告诉我们这个问题，好让我们有所准备。”

Anna and Mark then took turns 轮流 role-playing 角色扮演 the two sides 双方 with one playing ABC and the other disarming 化解 these accusations with anticipatory 预先的 labels 标签.

[.my2]
然后，安娜和马克轮流扮演双方——一个扮演ABC公司，另一个则用预先准备好的标签来化解这些指责。

"You're going to think we are a big bad prime contractor when we are done," Anna practiced saying slowly and naturally 自然地.

[.my2]
“等我们说完，你会觉得我们是一家坏透了的大型总承包商。”安娜练习着用缓慢且自然的语气说道。

"It seems you feel this work was promised to you from the beginning," Mark said.

[.my2]
“看起来你觉得从一开始，这些工作就承诺给你们了。”马克说道。

They trained 训练 in front of an observer 观察者, honing 磨练 their pacing 节奏, deciding at what point 时刻 they would label each fear, and planning when to include meaningful 有意义的 pauses 停顿.

[.my2]
他们在一位观察者面前进行训练，磨练说话的节奏，确定在哪个时刻给每种恐惧贴标签，并计划何时加入有意义的停顿。

It was theater 戏剧表演.

[.my2]
这就像一场戏剧表演。

When the day of the meeting arrived 到来, Anna opened by acknowledging 承认 ABC's biggest gripes 抱怨.

[.my2]
会议当天，安娜一开场就承认了ABC公司最主要的抱怨。

"We understand that we brought you on board 吸纳进来 with the shared goal 共同目标 of having you lead 主导 this work," she said.

[.my2]
“我们明白，当时吸纳你们加入，是带着让你们主导这项工作的共同目标。”她说。

"You may feel like we have treated 对待 you unfairly 不公平地 and that we changed the deal 协议 significantly 大大地 since then.

[.my2]
“你们可能觉得我们待你们不公平，而且从那以后，我们大大改变了协议内容。

We acknowledge 承认 that you believe 认为 you were promised 承诺 this work.

[.my2]
我们承认，你们认为这些工作是承诺给你们的。

This received an emphatic 强调的；坚决的 nod 点头 from the ABC representatives 代表.

[.my2]
ABC公司的代表们对此给予了坚决的点头回应。

So Anna continued by outlining 概述 the situation 情况 in a way that encouraged 鼓励 the ABC reps to see the firms's teammates 队友, peppering 点缀 her statements 陈述 with open-ended questions 开放式问题 that showed she was listening 倾听.

[.my2]
于是，安娜继续概述情况，她的表述方式鼓励ABC公司的代表们将对方视为团队伙伴，同时在陈述中穿插开放式问题，以表明自己在认真倾听。

What else is there you feel is important to add to this? By labeling the fears and asking for input 意见, Anna was able to elicit 引出 an important fact 事实 about ABC's fears, namely 即 that ABC was expecting 预期 this to be a high profit 高利润 contract because it thought Anna's firm was doing quite well from the deal 项目.

[.my2]
“你觉得还有什么重要的事情需要补充吗？”通过给恐惧贴标签并征求意见，安娜引出了一个关于ABC公司恐惧的重要事实：ABC公司原本期望这是一份高利润合同，因为它认为安娜的公司从这个项目中赚了很多钱。

This provided 提供 an entry point 切入点 for Mark, who explained 解释 that the client's new demands 要求 had turned his firm's profits 利润 into losses 亏损, meaning that he and Anna needed to cut ABC's pay 报酬 further to three people.

[.my2]
这为马克提供了一个切入点，他解释说，客户的新要求已经让他的公司从盈利变成了亏损，这意味着他和安娜需要将ABC公司的报酬进一步削减到三人份。

Angela, one of ABC's representatives, gasped 倒抽一口气.

[.my2]
ABC公司的代表之一安吉拉倒抽了一口气。

"It sounds like you think we are the big bad prime contractor trying to push out 排挤 the small business," Anna said, heading off 阻止 the accusation 指责 before it could be made.

[.my2]
“听起来你觉得我们是那家坏透了的大型总承包商，想排挤小企业。”安娜在对方提出指责之前就先发制人地说道。

"No, no, we don't think that," Anna said, conditioned 使习惯于 by the acknowledgement 承认 to look for common ground 共同点.

[.my2]
“不，不，我们不这么认为。”安吉拉说道——因为安娜的承认，她已经倾向于寻找双方的共同点。

With the negatives 负面事物 labeled and the worst accusations 指责 laid bare 揭露, Anna and Mark were able to turn the conversation 谈话 to the contract 合同.

[.my2]
随着负面事物被贴上标签，最糟糕的指责被揭露出来，安娜和马克得以将谈话转向合同本身。

Watch what they do closely 仔细地 as it's brilliant 出色的.

[.my2]
仔细看看他们接下来的做法，非常出色。

They acknowledge 承认 ABC's situation while simultaneously 同时 shifting 转移 the onus 责任 of offering 提出 a solution 解决方案 to the smaller company.

[.my2]
他们承认了ABC公司的处境，同时将提出解决方案的责任转移给了这家小公司。

"It sounds like you have a great handle on 精通；熟悉 how the government contract 政府合同 should work," Anna said, labeling Angela's expertise 专业知识.

[.my2]
“听起来你非常熟悉政府合同的运作方式。”安娜一边说，一边给安吉拉的专业知识贴上了标签。

"Yes, but I know that's not how it always goes," Angela answered, proud 自豪的 to have her experience 经验 acknowledged 认可.

[.my2]
“是的，但我知道事情并非总能按理想状态发展。”安吉拉回答道，对于自己的经验得到认可感到自豪。

Anna then asked Angela how she would amend 修改 the contract.

[.my2]
随后，安娜问安吉拉会如何修改合同。

so that everyone made some money, which pushed 促使 Angela to admit 承认 that she saw no way to do so without cutting ABC's worker count 员工数量.

[.my2]
（安娜希望修改后）每个人都能赚到一些钱，这促使安吉拉承认，她认为要做到这一点，除了削减ABC公司的员工数量外别无他法。

Several weeks later, the contract was tweaked 微调 to cut ABC's payout 报酬, which brought Anna's company $1 million that put the contract into the black 盈利.

[.my2]
几周后，合同经过微调，削减了ABC公司的报酬，这为安娜的公司带来了100万美元的收入，使得这份合同实现了盈利。

But it was Angela's reaction 反应 at the end of the meeting that most surprised 使惊讶 Anna.

[.my2]
但最让安娜惊讶的，是会议结束时安吉拉的反应。

After Anna had acknowledged 承认 that she had given Angela some bad news 坏消息 and that she understood how angry 愤怒的 she must feel, Angela said, "This is not a good situation 情况, but we appreciate 感激 the fact that you are acknowledging what happened and we don't feel like you are mistreating 虐待；不公平对待 us and you are not the big bad prime 总承包商." Anna's reaction to how this turned out.

[.my2]
安娜承认自己给了安吉拉一些坏消息，并且理解她肯定会感到愤怒。之后，安吉拉说：“这不是一个好情况，但我们很感激你们承认所发生的一切。我们不觉得你们在不公平对待我们，你们也不是那家坏透了的大型总承包商。”安娜对这个结果的反应是（难以置信）。

Holy crap 天啊, this stuff 东西；方法 actually works 起作用.

[.my2]
天啊，这方法居然真的管用。

She's right 正确的.

[.my2]
她是对的。

As you just saw, the beauty 妙处 of going right after 直面 negativity 消极情绪 is that it brings us to a safe zone 安全区域 of empathy 同理心.

[.my2]
正如你刚才看到的，直面消极情绪的妙处在于，它能把我们带到一个充满同理心的安全区域。

Every one of us has an inherent 内在的；天生的 human need 需求 to be understood 被理解, to connect with 与……建立联系 the person across the table 桌子对面的人.

[.my2]
我们每个人都有被理解、与桌子对面的人建立联系的内在需求。

That explains why after Anna labeled Angela's fears, Angela's first instinct 本能 was to add nuance 细微差别 and detail 细节 to those fears.

[.my2]
这就解释了为什么在安娜给安吉拉的恐惧贴了标签后，安吉拉的第一反应是为那些恐惧补充细微差别和细节。

And that detail gave Anna the power 力量 to accomplish 完成 what she wanted from the negotiation 谈判.

[.my2]
而这些细节给了安娜力量，让她得以在谈判中实现自己的目标。

Get a seat and an upgrade 升级 on a soldout 售罄的 flight 航班.

[.my2]
在售罄的航班上获得一个座位并升级舱位。

Up to this point 到目前为止, we've been building each skill 技能 as if they were musical instruments 乐器.

[.my2]
到目前为止，我们一直在逐个培养这些技能，就好像它们是一件件乐器一样。

First, try the saxophone 萨克斯管 mirror 镜像法.

[.my2]
首先，试试“萨克斯管式”的镜像法。

Now, here's the bass 贝斯 label 标签法.

[.my2]
现在，来看看“贝斯式”的标签法。

And finally, why don't you blow a note 吹奏一个音符 on the French horn 圆号 of tactical silence 策略性沉默? But in a real negotiation 谈判, the band 乐队 all plays together 一起演奏.

[.my2]
最后，不妨试试“圆号式”的策略性沉默？但在真实的谈判中，所有“乐器”需要共同演奏。

So, you've got to learn how to conduct 指挥.

[.my2]
所以，你得学会如何“指挥”。

Keeping all the instruments playing is really awkward 尴尬的 for most people.

[.my2]
对大多数人来说，让所有“乐器”同时演奏真的很尴尬。

It seems to go by 流逝 in such a rush 匆忙.

[.my2]
谈判过程似乎总是在匆忙中流逝。

So, what I'm going to do here is play a song 歌曲 at slow speed 慢速 so you can hear each instrument note by note 逐个音符地.

[.my2]
所以，我接下来要做的，是把“这首曲子”放慢速度来演奏，这样你就能逐个音符地听到每件“乐器”的声音。

I promise 保证 you'll quickly see how the skills 技能 you have been building play off one another 相互配合.

[.my2]
我保证，你很快就能看到你所培养的这些技能是如何相互配合的。

Rising 上升, riffing 即兴发挥, falling 下降, and pausing 停顿 in perfect harmony 完美和谐.

[.my2]
它们在完美的和谐中起伏、即兴发挥和停顿。

Here is the situation 情况, the song, if you will.

[.my2]
这就是“曲子”的背景情况，可以这么说。

My student Ryan B was flying from Baltimore 巴尔的摩 to Austin 奥斯汀 to sign 签署 a large computer consulting contract 计算机咨询合同.

[.my2]
我的学生瑞安·B要从巴尔的摩飞往奥斯汀，去签署一份大型计算机咨询合同。

For 6 months, the client representative 客户代表 had gone back and forth 反复斟酌 on whether he wanted the services 服务.

[.my2]
六个月来，客户代表一直在反复斟酌是否需要这些服务。

But a major system collapse 系统崩溃 put the representative in a tight spot 困境 with his CEO 首席执行官.

[.my2]
但一次重大的系统崩溃让这位代表在他的首席执行官面前陷入了困境。

To shift the blame 推卸责任, he called Ryan with his CEO on the line 在线；通话中 and very aggressively 咄咄逼人地 demanded 要求 to know why it was taking Ryan so long to come ink the contract 签署合同.

[.my2]
为了推卸责任，他在和首席执行官通话时给瑞安打了电话，咄咄逼人地要求瑞安解释为什么花了这么长时间还不来签署合同。

If Ryan was not there by Friday morning 周五早上, he said the deal 交易 was off 取消.

[.my2]
他说，如果瑞安周五早上之前不到达，这笔交易就取消。

Ryan bought a ticket 机票 for the next morning, Thursday, but a freak 反常的 lightning storm 雷暴 whipped up 形成；掀起 in Baltimore, closing the airport 机场 for 5 hours.

[.my2]
瑞安买了第二天（周四）早上的机票，但巴尔的摩突然遭遇了一场反常的雷暴，机场关闭了5个小时。

It became painfully clear 显而易见 that Ryan wasn't going to make his original connection 转机航班 to Austin from Dallas 达拉斯.

[.my2]
瑞安显然赶不上从达拉斯飞往奥斯汀的原定转机航班，这一点显而易见，让人很苦恼。

Worse 更糟糕的是, when he called American Airlines 美国航空公司 just before departing 出发, he found that his connection had been automatically rebooked 自动重新预订 to 3:00 p.m.

[.my2]
更糟糕的是，就在出发前打电话给美国航空公司时，他发现自己的转机航班被自动重新预订到了第二天下午3点。

the next day, putting the contract in jeopardy 处于危险中.

[.my2]
这让合同陷入了危险之中。

When Ryan finally got to Dallas at 8:00 p.m., he ran to the gate 登机口 where the day's final 最后的 American Airlines flight 航班 to Austin was less than 30 minutes from takeoff 起飞.

[.my2]
当瑞安最终在晚上8点抵达达拉斯时，他跑到了登机口——当天最后一班飞往奥斯汀的美国航空公司航班距离起飞不到30分钟了。

His goal 目标 was to get on that flight, or at worst 最坏情况下, get an earlier flight 更早的航班 the next day.

[.my2]
他的目标是登上那班飞机，或者最坏的情况是，拿到第二天更早的航班机票。

In front of him at the gate, a very aggressive 咄咄逼人的 couple 夫妇 was yelling at 对……大喊大叫 the gate agent 登机口工作人员 who was barely 几乎不 looking at them as she tapped on 敲击 the computer 电脑 in front of her.

[.my2]
在登机口他前面，一对非常咄咄逼人的夫妇正在对登机口工作人员大喊大叫，而工作人员几乎没看他们一眼，只是在敲击面前的电脑。

She was clearly 明显地 making every effort 尽一切努力 not to scream back 回喊.

[.my2]
她显然在尽一切努力克制自己，不回喊过去。

After she'd said, "There's nothing I can do five times." The angry couple finally gave up 放弃 and left.

[.my2]
在她说了五次“我无能为力”之后，这对愤怒的夫妇最终放弃并离开了。

To start, watch how Ryan turns that heated exchange 激烈的交流 to his advantage 对自己有利.

[.my2]
首先，看看瑞安是如何将这场激烈的交流转化为对自己有利的局面的。

Following on the heels of 紧随……之后 an argument 争吵 is a great position 处境 for a negotiator 谈判者 because your counterpart 对方 is desperate for 渴望 an empathetic connection 共情联系.

[.my2]
紧随一场争吵之后（与对方沟通），对谈判者来说是一个绝佳的处境，因为对方此时非常渴望建立共情联系。

Smile 微笑 and you're already an improvement 进步.

[.my2]
只要微笑一下，你就已经比之前的人做得更好了。

Hi Wendy, I'm Ryan.

[.my2]
“嗨，温迪，我是瑞安。”

要不要我帮你整理一份瑞安机场谈判场景的技能拆解表？表格会按时间顺序梳理瑞安在机场应对登机口工作人员的过程中，可能用到的镜像法、标签法、策略性沉默等具体技巧，以及每个技巧对应的沟通目标和预期效果，帮你更清晰地理解谈判技能在实际场景中的组合应用。

It seems like they were pretty upset 心烦的；沮丧的.

[.my2]
看起来他们刚才挺心烦的。

This labels 标记；贴标签 the negative 消极的；负面的 and establishes 建立 a rapport 融洽关系 based on empathy 同理心.

[.my2]
这一举动给负面情绪贴了标签，并基于同理心建立了融洽的关系。

[.my2]
这反过来又鼓励温迪详细阐述她的处境。

Words Ryan then mirrors 镜像模仿 to invite 促使 her to go further 深入下去.

[.my2]
瑞安随后通过镜像模仿她的话，促使她继续说下去。

Yeah, they missed their connection 转机航班.

[.my2]
“是啊，他们没赶上转机航班。”

We've had a fair amount of 相当多的 delays 延误 because of the weather 天气.

[.my2]
“因为天气原因，我们已经遇到了相当多的延误。”

The weather 天气.

[.my2]
“天气啊。”

After Wendy explains how the delays in the Northeast 东北部 had rippled through 波及；影响 the system 系统, Ryan again labels the negative and then mirrors her answer to encourage her to delve further 深入探究.

[.my2]
温迪解释了东北部的延误如何波及整个（航班）系统后，瑞安再次给负面情况贴标签，然后镜像模仿她的回答，鼓励她进一步深入说明。

It seems like it's been a hectic 忙碌的；紧张的 day.

[.my2]
“看起来今天真是忙碌又紧张的一天。”

There have been a lot of irate 愤怒的；暴怒的 consumers 顾客, you know.

[.my2]
“你知道吗，今天有好多愤怒的顾客。”

I mean, I get it 理解；明白.

[.my2]
“我是说，我能理解。”

Even though I don't like to be yelled at 被大喊大叫, a lot of people are trying to get to Austin for the big game 大型比赛.

[.my2]
“虽然我不喜欢被人大喊大叫，但确实有很多人要去奥斯汀看那场大型比赛。”

The big game 大型比赛.

[.my2]
“那场大型比赛啊。”

UT is playing Miss football 密西西比大学橄榄球队 and every flight into Austin has been booked solid 预订一空.

[.my2]
“德克萨斯大学要对阵密西西比大学橄榄球队，所有飞往奥斯汀的航班都已经预订一空了。”

Booked solid 预订一空.

[.my2]
“预订一空啊。”

Now, let's pause 暂停.

[.my2]
现在，我们来暂停一下。

Up to this point 到目前为止, Ryan has been using labels and mirrors to build a relationship 建立关系 with Wendy.

[.my2]
到目前为止，瑞安一直在用贴标签和镜像模仿的方法与温迪建立关系。

To her, it must seem like idle chatter 闲聊, though, because he hasn't asked for anything.

[.my2]
不过，对她来说，这可能只是闲聊，因为瑞安还没有提出任何要求。

Unlike 不像 the angry couple 夫妇, Ryan is acknowledging 承认 her situation.

[.my2]
与那对愤怒的夫妇不同，瑞安在认可她的处境。

His words pingpong 来回切换 between, "What's that?" and, "I hear you." Both of which invite her to elaborate 详细说明.

[.my2]
他的话在“怎么回事？”和“我明白你的意思。”之间来回切换，这两句话都能促使她进一步详细说明。

Now that the empathy has been built 建立, she lets slip 无意中透露 a piece of information 信息 he can use.

[.my2]
既然已经建立了共情，她无意中透露了一条瑞安可以利用的信息。

Yeah.

[.my2]
“是啊。”

[.my2]
“不过，整个周末，谁知道有多少人能赶上航班呢。”

The weather's probably going to reroute 改变路线 a lot of people through a lot of different places.

[.my2]
“天气可能会让很多人改道，经过各种各样不同的地方。”

Here's where Ryan finally swoops in 突然介入 with an ask 请求.

[.my2]
就在这时，瑞安终于带着请求突然介入了。

But notice 注意 how he acts 表现.

[.my2]
但要注意他的表现方式。

Not assertive 武断的；强硬的 or coldly logical 冷漠地讲逻辑, but with empathy and labeling that acknowledges her situation and tacitly 含蓄地 puts them in the same boat 处境相同；同舟共济.

[.my2]
他没有表现得武断或冷漠地讲逻辑，而是带着同理心，通过贴标签认可她的处境，含蓄地表明两人处境相同。

Well, it seems like you've been handling 应对 the rough 艰难的 day pretty well.

[.my2]
“嗯，看起来你今天应对这艰难的一天，做得相当不错。”

He says, "I was also affected by 受……影响 the weather delays and missed my connecting flight 转机航班.

[.my2]
他说：“我也受到了天气延误的影响，没赶上转机航班。

It seems like this flight is likely 可能 booked solid 预订一空, but with what you said, maybe someone affected by the weather might miss this connection 转机.

[.my2]
“看起来这趟航班可能已经预订一空了，但根据你刚才说的，也许有些受天气影响的人会赶不上这趟转机。

Is there any possibility 可能性 a seat will be open 空着的? Listen to that riff 即兴发挥.

[.my2]
“有没有可能会空出一个座位呢？”听听这段“即兴发挥”。

Label tactical empathy 策略性共情 label, and only then a request 请求.

[.my2]
30秒后，温迪打印出一张登机牌递给瑞安，并解释说，有几个座位原本应该由一些人乘坐，但这些人现在会比航班起飞时间晚很多才能到达。

To make Ryan's success 成功 even better, she puts him in economy plus seating 超级经济舱座位.

[.my2]
为了让瑞安的这次成功更圆满，她把他安排在了超级经济舱。

All that in under 2 minutes 分钟.

[.my2]
这一切都发生在不到两分钟的时间里。

The next time you find yourself following 跟在……后面 an angry customer 顾客 at a corner store 街角小店 or airplane line 登机队伍, take a moment 花点时间 and practice 练习 labels and mirrors on the service person 服务人员.

[.my2]
下次当你发现自己在街角小店或登机队伍中，跟在一个愤怒的顾客后面时，花点时间对服务人员练习一下贴标签和镜像模仿的技巧。

== pure

Don't feel their pain. + 

Label it. + 

It was 1998 and I was standing in a narrow hallway outside an apartment on the 27th floor of a high-rise in Harlem. + 

I was the head of the New York City FBI crisis negotiation team. + 

And that day, I was the primary negotiator. + 

The investigative squad had reported that at least three heavily armed fugitives were holed up inside. + 

Several days earlier, the fugitives had used automatic weapons in a shootout with a rival gang. + 

So, the New York City FBI SWAT team was arrayed behind me and our snipers were on nearby rooftops with rifles trained on the apartment windows. + 

In tense situations like this, the traditional negotiating advice is to keep a poker face. + 

Don't get emotional. + 

Until recently, most academics and researchers completely ignored the role of emotion in negotiation. + 

Emotions were just an obstacle to a good outcome, they said. + 

Separate the people from the problem was the common refrain. + 

But think about that. + 

How can you separate people from the problem when their emotions are the problem? Especially when they are scared people with guns. + 

Emotions are one of the main things that derail communication. + 

Once people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out the window. + 

That's why instead of denying or ignoring emotions, good negotiators identify and influence them. + 

They are able to precisely label emotions, those of others, and especially their own. + 

And once they label the emotions, they talk about them without getting wound up. + 

For them, emotion is a tool. + 

Emotions aren't the obstacles. + 

They are the means. + 

The relationship between an emotionally intelligent negotiator and their counterpart is essentially therapeutic. + 

It duplicates that of a psychotherapist with a patient. + 

The psychotherapist pokes and prods to understand his patients problems and then turns the responses back onto the patient to get him to go deeper and change his behavior. + 

That's exactly what good negotiators do. + 

Getting to this level of emotional intelligence demands opening up your senses, talking less, and listening more. + 

You can learn almost everything you need and a lot more than other people would like you to know simply by watching and listening, keeping your eyes peeled and your ears open and your mouth shut. + 

Think about the therapist's couch as you read the following sections. + 

You'll see how a soothing voice, close listening, and a calm repetition of the words of your patient can get you a lot further than a cold, rational argument. + 

It may sound touchyfey, but if you can perceive the emotions of others, you have a chance to turn them to your advantage. + 

The more you know about someone, the more power you have. + 

Tactical empathy. + 

We had one big problem that day in Harlem. + 

No telephone number to call into the apartment. + 

So, for six straight hours, relieved periodically by two FBI agents who were learning crisis negotiation, I spoke through the apartment door. + 

I used my late night FM DJ voice. + 

I didn't give orders in my DJ voice or ask what the fugitives wanted. + 

Instead, I imagined myself in their place. + 

It looks like you don't want to come out, I said repeatedly. + 

It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing. + 

It looks like you don't want to go back to jail. + 

For 6 hours, we got no response. + 

The FBI coaches loved my DJ voice, but was it working? And then when we were almost completely convinced that no one was inside, a sniper on an adjacent building radioed that he saw one of the curtains in the apartment move. + 

The front door of the apartment slowly opened. + 

A woman emerged with her hands in front of her. + 

I continued talking. + 

All three fugitives came out. + 

None of them said a word until we had them in handcuffs. + 

Then I asked them the question that was most nagging me. + 

Why did they come out after 6 hours of radio silence? Why did they finally give in? All three gave me the same answer. + 

We didn't want to get caught or get shot, but you calmed us down, they said. + 

We finally believed you wouldn't go away, so we just came out. + 

There is nothing more frustrating or disruptive to any negotiation than to get the feeling you are talking to someone who isn't listening. + 

Playing dumb is a valid negotiating technique and I don't understand is a legitimate response, but ignoring the other party's position only builds up frustration and makes them less likely to do what you want. + 

The opposite of that is tactical empathy. + 

In my negotiating course, I tell my students that empathy is the ability to recognize the perspective of a counterpart and the vocalization of that recognition. + 

That's an academic way of saying that empathy is paying attention to another human being, asking what they are feeling and making a commitment to understanding their world. + 

Notice I didn't say anything about agreeing with the other person's values and beliefs or giving out hugs. + 

That's sympathy. + 

What I'm talking about is trying to understand a situation from another person's perspective. + 

One step beyond that is tactical empathy. + 

Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings. + 

So you increase your influence in all the moments that follow. + 

It's bringing our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done. + 

It's emotional intelligence on steroids. + 

As a cop in Kansas City, I was curious about how a select handful of veteran cops managed to talk angry violent people out of fights or to get them to put down their knives and guns. + 

When I asked how they did that, I rarely got more than a shrug. + 

They couldn't articulate what they did. + 

But now I know the answer is tactical empathy. + 

They were able to think from another person's point of view while they were talking with that person and quickly assess what was driving them. + 

Most of us enter verbal combat unlikely to persuade anyone of anything because we only know and care about our own goals and perspective. + 

But the best officers are tuned in to the other party, their audience. + 

They know that if they empathize, they can mold their audience by how they approach and talk to them. + 

That's why if a corrections officer approaches an inmate expecting him to resist, he often will. + 

But if he approaches exuding calm, the inmate will be much more likely to be peaceful. + 

It seems like wizardry, but it's not. + 

It's just that when the officer has his audience clearly in mind, he can become who he needs to be to handle the situation. + 

Empathy is a classic soft communication skill, but it has a physical basis. + 

When we closely observe a person's face, gestures, and tone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process called neural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think and feel. + 

In an fMRI brain scan experiment, researchers at Princeton University found that neural resonance disappears when people communicate poorly. + 

The researchers could predict how well people were communicating by observing how much their brains were aligned. + 

And they discovered that people who paid the most attention, good listeners, could actually anticipate what the speaker was about to say before he said it. + 

If you want to increase your neural resonance skills, take a moment right now and practice. + 

Turn your attention to someone who's talking near you or watch a person being interviewed on TV. + 

As they talk, imagine that you are that person. + 

Visualize yourself in the position they describe and put in as much detail as you can as if you were actually there. + 

But be warned, a lot of classic dealmakers will think your approach is soft-headed and weak. + 

Just ask former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. + 

A few years ago, during a speech at Georgetown University, Clinton advocated showing respect even for one's enemies, trying to understand and in so far as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view. + 

You can predict what happened next. + 

A gaggle of pundits and politicians pounced on her. + 

They called her inane and naive and even a sign she had embraced the Muslim Brotherhood. + 

Some said that she had blown her chances at a presidential run. + 

The problem with all of that hot air is that she was right. + 

Politics aside, empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. + 

It's about understanding them. + 

Empathy helps us learn the position the enemy is in, why their actions make sense to them, and what might move them. + 

As negotiators, we use empathy, because it works. + 

Empathy is why the three fugitives came out after 6 hours of my late night DJ voice. + 

It's what helped me succeed at what Sun Sue called the supreme art of war, to subdue the enemy without fighting. + 

Labeling. + 

Let's go back to the Harlem doorway for a minute. + 

We didn't have a lot to go on, but if you've got three fugitives trapped in an apartment on the 27th floor of a building in Harlem, they don't have to say a word for you to know that they're worried about two things: getting killed and going to jail. + 

So, for six straight hours in that sweltering apartment building hallway, the two FBI negotiating students and I took turns speaking. + 

We rotated in order to avoid verbal stumbles and other errors caused by tiredness. + 

And we stayed relentlessly on message, all three of us saying the same thing. + 

Now, pay close attention to exactly what we said. + 

It looks like you don't want to come out. + 

It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing. + 

It looks like you don't want to go back to jail. + 

We employed our tactical empathy by recognizing and then verbalizing the predictable emotions of the situation. + 

We didn't just put ourselves in the fugitive shoes. + 

We spotted their feelings, turned them into words, and then very calmly and respectfully repeated their emotions back to them. + 

In a negotiation, that's called labeling. + 

Labeling is a way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it. + 

Give someone's emotion a name and you show you identify with how that person feels. + 

It gets you close to someone without asking about external factors you know nothing about. + 

How's your family? Think of labeling as a shortcut to intimacy. + 

A time-saving emotional hack. + 

Labeling has a special advantage when your counterpart is tense. + 

Exposing negative thoughts to daylight. + 

It looks like you don't want to go back to jail makes them seem less frightening. + 

In one brain imaging study, two psychology professor Matthew Liberman of the University of California, Los Angeles found that when people are shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater activity in the amygdala, the part that generates fear. + 

But when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking. + 

In other words, labeling an emotion, applying rational words to a fear disrupts its raw intensity. + 

Labeling is a simple, versatile skill that lets you reinforce a good aspect of the negotiation or diffuse a negative one, but it has very specific rules about form and delivery. + 

That makes it less like chatting than like a formal art such as Chinese calligraphy. + 

For most people, it's one of the most awkward negotiating tools to use. + 

Before they try it the first time, my students almost always tell me they expect their counterpart to jump up and shout, "Don't you dare tell me how I feel." Let me let you in on a secret. + 

People never even notice. + 

The first step to labeling is detecting the other person's emotional state. + 

Outside that door in Harlem, we couldn't even see the fugitives. + 

But most of the time, you'll have a wealth of information from the other person's words, tone, and body language. + 

We call that trinity words, music, and dance. + 

The trick to spotting feelings is to pay close attention to changes people undergo when they respond to external events. + 

Most often, those events are your words. + 

If you say, "How is the family?" and the corners of the other party's mouth turn down even when they say, "It's great," you might detect that all is not well. + 

If their voice goes flat when a colleague is mentioned, there could be a problem between the two. + 

And if your landlord unconsciously fidgets his feet when you mention the neighbors, it's pretty clear that he doesn't think much of them. + 

We'll dig deeper into how to spot and use these cues in chapter 9. + 

Picking up on these tiny pieces of information is how psychics work. + 

They size up their client's body language and ask him a few innocent questions. + 

when they tell his future a few minutes later, they're really just saying what he wants to hear based on small details they've spotted. + 

More than a few psychics would make good negotiators for that very reason. + 

Once you've spotted an emotion you want to highlight, the next step is to label it aloud. + 

Labels can be phrased as statements or questions. + 

The only difference is whether you end the sentence with a downward or upward inflection. + 

But no matter how they end, labels almost always begin with roughly the same words. + 

It seems like. + 

It sounds like. + 

It looks like. + 

Notice we said it sounds like and not I'm hearing that. + 

That's because the word I gets people's guard up. + 

When you say I, it says you're more interested in yourself than the other person. + 

And it makes you take personal responsibility for the words that follow and the offense they might cause. + 

But when you phrase a label as a neutral statement of understanding, it encourages your counterpart to be responsive. + 

They'll usually give a longer answer than just yes or no. + 

And if they disagree with the label, that's okay. + 

You can always step back and say, "I didn't say that was what it was. + 

I just said it seems like that. + 

The last rule of labeling is silence. + 

Once you've thrown out a label, be quiet and listen. + 

We all have a tendency to expand on what we've said. + 

To finish, it seems like you like the way that shirt looks with a specific question like, "Where did you get it?" But a label's power is that it invites the other person to reveal himself. + 

If you'll trust me for a second, take a break now and try it out. + 

Strike up a conversation and put a label on one of the other person's emotions. + 

It doesn't matter if you're talking to the mailman or your 10-year-old daughter. + 

And then go silent. + 

Let the label do its work. + 

Neutralize the negative, reinforce the positive. + 

Labeling is a tactic, not a strategy. + 

In the same way a spoon is a great tool for stirring soup, but it's not a recipe. + 

How you use labeling will go a long way in determining your success. + 

deployed well. + 

It's how we as negotiators identify and then slowly alter the inner voices of our counterparts consciousness to something more collaborative and trusting. + 

First, let's talk a little human psychology. + 

In basic terms, people's emotions have two levels. + 

The presenting behavior is the part above the surface you can see and hear. + 

Beneath the underlying feeling is what motivates the behavior. + 

Imagine a grandfather who's grumbly at a family holiday dinner. + 

The presenting behavior is that he's cranky, but the underlying emotion is a sad sense of loneliness from his family never seeing him. + 

What good negotiators do when labeling is address those underlying emotions. + 

Labeling negatives diffuses them or diffuses them in extreme cases. + 

Labeling positives reinforces them. + 

We'll come back to the cranky grandfather in a moment. + 

First though, I want to talk a little bit about anger. + 

As an emotion, anger is rarely productive in you or the person you're negotiating with. + 

It releases stress hormones and neurochemicals that disrupt your ability to properly evaluate and respond to situations, and it blinds you to the fact that you're angry in the first place, which gives you a false sense of confidence. + 

That's not to say that negative feelings should be ignored. + 

That can be just as damaging. + 

Instead, they should be teased out. + 

Labeling is a helpful tactic in deescalating angry confrontations because it makes the person acknowledge their feelings rather than continuing to act out. + 

Early on in my hostage negotiation career, I learned how important it was to go directly at negative dynamics in a fearless but differential manner. + 

It was to fix a situation I'd created myself. + 

I'd angered the top FBI official in Canada when I entered the country without first alerting him so he could notify the Department of State, a procedure known as country clearance. + 

I knew I needed to call and assuage him to straighten out the situation or I risked being expelled. + 

Top guys like to feel on top. + 

They don't want to be disrespected. + 

All the more so when the office they run isn't a sexy assignment. + 

Bless me, father, for I have sinned, I said when he answered the phone. + 

There was a long pause at the other end of the line. + 

Who is this? He said, "Bless me, father, for I have sinned," I repeated. + 

"It's Chris Voss." Again, there was a long silence. + 

Does your boss know you're here? I said he did and crossed my fingers. + 

At this point, the FBI official would have been completely within his rights to tell me to leave Canada immediately. + 

But by mentioning the negative dynamic, I knew I diffused it as much as I could. + 

I had a chance. + 

"All right, you've got country clearance," he finally said. + 

"I'll take care of the paperwork." Try this the next time you have to apologize for a boneheaded mistake. + 

Go right at it. + 

The fastest and most efficient means of establishing a quick working relationship is to acknowledge the negative and diffuse it. + 

Whenever I was dealing with the family of a hostage, I started out by saying I knew they were scared. + 

And when I make a mistake, something that happens a lot, I always acknowledge the other person's anger. + 

I found the phrase, "Look, I'm an asshole," to be an amazingly effective way to make problems go away. + 

That approach has never failed me. + 

Let's go back to the cranky grandfather. + 

He's grumpy because he never sees the family and he feels left out. + 

So, he's speaking up in his own dysfunctional way to get attention. + 

How do you fix that? Instead of addressing his grumpy behavior, you acknowledge his sadness in a non-judgmental way. + 

You head him off before he can really get started. + 

We don't see each other all that often, you could say. + 

It seems like you feel like we don't pay any attention to you and you only see us once a year, so why should you make time for us? Notice how that acknowledges the situation and labels his sadness. + 

Here, you can pause briefly, letting him recognize and appreciate your attempts to understand what he's feeling and then turn the situation around by offering a positive solution. + 

For us, this is a real treat. + 

We want to hear what you have to talk about. + 

We want to value this time with you because we feel left out of your life. + 

Research shows that the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it without reaction and without judgment. + 

Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts. + 

One of my Georgetown University students, a guy named TJ, who worked as an assistant controller at the Washington Redskins, put that lesson to work while he was taking my negotiations class. + 

The economy was in the toilet at the time, and Redskins season ticket holders were leaving in droves to avoid the cost. + 

Worse, the team had been terrible the year before, and off-field player problems were alienating the fans. + 

The team's CFO was getting more worried and cranky by the day. + 

And two weeks before the season was to start, he walked by TJ's desk and slammed down a folder full of paper. + 

"Better yesterday than today," he said and walked away. + 

Inside was a list of 40 seasoned ticket holders who hadn't paid their bills, a USB drive with a spreadsheet about each one's situation, and a script to use when calling them. + 

TJ saw right away that the script was a disaster. + 

It began by saying that his colleagues had been trying to call for months and the account had been escalated to him. + 

I wanted to inform you, it read, that in order to receive your tickets for the upcoming season opener against the New York Giants, you will need to pay your outstanding balance in full prior to September 10. + 

It was the stupidly aggressive, impersonal, tonedeaf style of communication that is the default for most business. + 

It was all me me from TJ with no acknowledgement of the ticket holder situation, no empathy, no connection. + 

Just give me the money. + 

Maybe I don't need to say it. + 

But the script didn't work. + 

TJ left messages. + 

No one called back. + 

A few weeks into the class, TJ rewrote the script. + 

These weren't massive changes, and he didn't offer the fans any discounts. + 

What he did was add subtle tweaks to make the call about the fans, their situation, and their love of the team. + 

Now, the team was your Washington Redskins. + 

And the purpose of the call was to ensure that the team's most valuable fans, the delinquent customers, would be there at the season opener. + 

The home field advantage created by you each and every Sunday at FedEx Field does not go unnoticed, TJ wrote. + 

He then told them, "In these difficult times, we understand our fans have been hit hard and we are here to work with you and ask the ticket holders to call back to talk through their unique situation. + 

Though superficially simple, the changes TJ made in the script had a deep emotional resonance with the delinquent ticket holders. + 

It mentioned their debt to the team, but also acknowledged the team's debt to them. + 

And by labeling the tough economic times and the stress they were causing, it diffused the biggest negative dynamic, their delinquency, and turned the issue into something solvable. + 

The simple changes masked a complex understanding of empathy on TJ's side. + 

With the new script, TJ was able to set up payment plans with all the ticket holders before the Giants game. + 

and the CFO's next visit. + 

Well, it was far less tur clear the road before advertising the destination. + 

Remember the amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear in reaction to threats? Well, the faster we can interrupt the amygdala's reaction to real or imaginary threats, the faster we can clear the road of obstacles and the quicker we can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust. + 

We do that by labeling the fears. + 

These labels are so powerful because they bathe the fears in sunlight, bleaching them of their power and showing our counterpart that we understand. + 

Think back to that Harlem landing. + 

I didn't say it seems like you want us to let you go. + 

We could all agree on that. + 

But that wouldn't have diffused the real fear in the apartment or shown that I empathized with the grim complexity of their situation. + 

That's why I went right at the amygdala and said, "It seems like you don't want to go back to jail." Once they've been labeled and brought into the open, the negative reactions in your counterparts amydala will begin to soften. + 

I promise it will shock you how suddenly his language turns from worry to optimism. + 

Empathy is a powerful mood enhancer. + 

The road is not always cleared so easily, so don't be demoralized if this process seems to go slowly. + 

The Harlem high-rise negotiation took 6 hours. + 

Many of us wear fears upon fears like layers against the cold. + 

So getting to safety takes time. + 

That was the experience of another one of my students, a fundraiser for the Girl Scouts, who backed into naming her counterparts fears almost accidentally. + 

We're not talking about someone who sold Girl Scout cookies. + 

My student was an experienced fundraiser who regularly got donors to pony up $1,000 to $25,000 a check. + 

Over the years, she'd developed a very successful system to get her clients, usually wealthy women, to open their checkbook. + 

She'd invite a potential donor to her office, serve a few Girl Scouts cookies, walk her through an album of heartwarming snapshots and handwritten letters from projects that match the woman's profile, and then collect a check when the donor's eyes lit up. + 

It was almost easy. + 

One day though, she met the immovable donor. + 

Once the woman sat down in her office, my student began to throw out the projects her research had said would fit. + 

But the woman shook her head at one project after another. + 

My student found herself growing perplexed at the difficult donor who had no interest in donating. + 

But she held her emotion in check and reached back to a lesson from my recent class on labeling. + 

"I'm sensing some hesitation with these projects," she said in what she hoped was a level voice. + 

As if she'd been unccorked, the woman exclaimed, "I want my gift to directly support programming for Girl Scouts and not anything else." This helped focus the conversation. + 

But as my student put forth project after project that seemed to fulfill the donor's criteria, all she got was still rejection. + 

Sensing the potential donor's growing frustration and wanting to end on a positive note so that they might be able to meet again, my student used another label. + 

It seems that you are really passionate about this gift and want to find the right project reflecting the opportunities and life-changing experiences the Girl Scouts gave you. + 

And with that, this difficult woman signed a check without even picking a specific project. + 

You understand me, she said as she got up to leave. + 

I trust you'll find the right project. + 

Fear of her money being misappropriated was the presenting dynamic that the first label uncovered. + 

But the second label uncovered the underlying dynamic. + 

Her very presence in the office was driven by very specific memories of being a little girl scout and how it changed her life. + 

The obstacle here wasn't finding the right match for the woman. + 

It wasn't that she was this highly finicky, hard-to- donor. + 

The real obstacle was that this woman needed to feel that she was understood. + 

That the person handling her money knew why she was in that office and understood the memories that were driving her actions. + 

That's why labels are so powerful and so potentially transformative to the state of any conversation. + 

By digging beneath what seems like a mountain of quibbles, details, and logistics, labels help to uncover and identify the primary emotion driving almost all of your counterparts behavior. + 

The emotion that once acknowledged seems to miraculously solve everything else. + 

Do an accusation audit. + 

On the first day of negotiating class each semester, I march the group through an introductory exercise called 60 seconds or she dies. + 

I play a hostage taker and a student has to convince me to release my hostage within a minute. + 

It's an icebreaker that shows me the level of my students and it reveals to them how much they need to learn. + 

Here's a little secret. + 

The hostage never gets out. + 

Sometimes students jump right in, but finding takers is usually hard because it means coming to the front of the class and competing with the guy who holds all the cards. + 

If I just ask for a volunteer, my students sit on their hands and look away. + 

You've been there. + 

You can almost feel your back muscles tense as you think, "Oh, please don't call on me." So, I don't ask. + 

Instead, I say, "In case you're worried about volunteering to roleplay with me in front of the class, I want to tell you in advance. + 

It's going to be horrible." After the laughter dies down, I then say, "And those of you who do volunteer will probably get more out of this than anyone else. + 

I always end up with more volunteers than I need. + 

Now, look at what I did." I prefaced the conversation by labeling my audience's fears. + 

How much worse can something be than horrible? I diffuse them and wait, letting it sink in and thereby making the unreasonable seem less forbidding. + 

All of us have intuitively done something close to this thousands of times. + 

You'll start a criticism of a friend by saying, "I don't want this to sound harsh." Hoping that whatever comes next will be softened. + 

Or you'll say, "I don't want to seem like an asshole." hoping your counterpart will tell you a few sentences later that you're not that bad. + 

The small but critical mistake this commits is denying the negative. + 

That actually gives it credence. + 

In court, defense lawyers do this properly by mentioning everything their client is accused of and all the weaknesses of their case in the opening statement. + 

They call this technique taking the sting out. + 

What I want to do here is turn this into a process that applied systematically, you can use to disarm your counterpart while negotiating everything from your son's bedtime to large business contracts. + 

The first step of doing so is listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you in what I call an accusation audit. + 

This idea of an accusation audit is really, really hard for people to get their minds around. + 

The first time I tell my students about it, they say, "Oh my god, we can't do that. + 

It seems both artificial and self-loathing. + 

It seems like it would make things worse." But then I remind them that it's exactly what I did the first day of class when I labeled their fears of the hostage game in advance. + 

And they all admit that none of them knew. + 

As an example, I'm going to use the experience of one of my students, Anna, because I couldn't be more proud at how she turned what she learned in my class into $1 million. + 

At the time, Anna was representing a major government contractor. + 

Her firm had won a competition for a sizable government deal by partnering with a smaller company, let's call it ABC Corp., whose CEO had a close relationship with the government client representative. + 

Problems started right after they won the contract. + 

Though, because ABC's relationship had been instrumental in winning the deal, ABC felt that it was owed a piece of the pie, whether it fulfilled its part of the contract or not. + 

And so, while the contract paid them for the work of nine people, they continually cut back support. + 

As Anna's company had to perform ABC's work, the relationship between ABC and Anna's company fragmented into vuperative emails and bitter complaining. + 

Facing an already low profit margin, Anna's company was forced into tough negotiations to get ABC to take a cut to five people. + 

The negotiations left a bitter aftertaste on both sides. + 

The vituprative emails stopped, but then again, all emails stopped and no communication is always a bad sign. + 

A few months after those painful talks, the client demanded a major rethink on the project and Anna's firm was faced with losing serious money if it didn't get ABC to agree to further cuts. + 

Because ABC wasn't living up to its side of the bargain, Anna's firm would have had strong contractual grounds to cut out ABC altogether. + 

But that would have damaged Anna's firm's reputation with a very important customer and could have led to litigation from ABC. + 

Faced with this scenario, Anna set up a meeting with ABC where she and her partners planned to inform ABC that its pay was being cut to three people. + 

It was a touchy situation as ABC was already unhappy about the first cut. + 

Even though she was normally an aggressive and confident negotiator, worries about the negotiations ruined Anna's sleep for weeks. + 

She needed to extract concessions while improving the relationship at the same time. + 

No easy task, right? To prepare, the first thing Anna did was sit down with her negotiating partner, Mark, and list every negative charge that ABC could level at them. + 

The relationship had gone sour long before, so the list was huge. + 

But the biggest possible accusations were easy to spot. + 

You are the typical prime contractor trying to force out the small guy. + 

You promised us we would have all this work, and you reneged on your promise. + 

You could have told us about this issue weeks ago to help us prepare. + 

Anna and Mark then took turns role-playing the two sides with one playing ABC and the other disarming these accusations with anticipatory labels. + 

"You're going to think we are a big bad prime contractor when we are done," Anna practiced saying slowly and naturally. + 

"It seems you feel this work was promised to you from the beginning," Mark said. + 

They trained in front of an observer, honing their pacing, deciding at what point they would label each fear, and planning when to include meaningful pauses. + 

It was theater. + 

When the day of the meeting arrived, Anna opened by acknowledging ABC's biggest gripes. + 

"We understand that we brought you on board with the shared goal of having you lead this work," she said. + 

"You may feel like we have treated you unfairly and that we changed the deal significantly since then. + 

We acknowledge that you believe you were promised this work. + 

This received an emphatic nod from the ABC representatives. + 

So Anna continued by outlining the situation in a way that encouraged the ABC reps to see the firms's teammates, peppering her statements with open-ended questions that showed she was listening. + 

What else is there you feel is important to add to this? By labeling the fears and asking for input, Anna was able to elicit an important fact about ABC's fears, namely that ABC was expecting this to be a high profit contract because it thought Anna's firm was doing quite well from the deal. + 

This provided an entry point for Mark, who explained that the client's new demands had turned his firm's profits into losses, meaning that he and Anna needed to cut ABC's pay further to three people. + 

Angela, one of ABC's representatives, gasped. + 

"It sounds like you think we are the big bad prime contractor trying to push out the small business," Anna said, heading off the accusation before it could be made. + 

"No, no, we don't think that," Anna said, conditioned by the acknowledgement to look for common ground. + 

With the negatives labeled and the worst accusations laid bare, Anna and Mark were able to turn the conversation to the contract. + 

Watch what they do closely as it's brilliant. + 

They acknowledge ABC's situation while simultaneously shifting the onus of offering a solution to the smaller company. + 

"It sounds like you have a great handle on how the government contract should work," Anna said, labeling Angela's expertise. + 

"Yes, but I know that's not how it always goes," Angela answered, proud to have her experience acknowledged. + 

Anna then asked Angela how she would amend the contract. + 

so that everyone made some money, which pushed Angela to admit that she saw no way to do so without cutting ABC's worker count. + 

Several weeks later, the contract was tweaked to cut ABC's payout, which brought Anna's company $1 million that put the contract into the black. + 

But it was Angela's reaction at the end of the meeting that most surprised Anna. + 

After Anna had acknowledged that she had given Angela some bad news and that she understood how angry she must feel, Angela said, "This is not a good situation, but we appreciate the fact that you are acknowledging what happened and we don't feel like you are mistreating us and you are not the big bad prime." Anna's reaction to how this turned out. + 

Holy crap, this stuff actually works. + 

She's right. + 

As you just saw, the beauty of going right after negativity is that it brings us to a safe zone of empathy. + 

Every one of us has an inherent human need to be understood, to connect with the person across the table. + 

That explains why after Anna labeled Angela's fears, Angela's first instinct was to add nuance and detail to those fears. + 

And that detail gave Anna the power to accomplish what she wanted from the negotiation. + 

Get a seat and an upgrade on a soldout flight. + 

Up to this point, we've been building each skill as if they were musical instruments. + 

First, try the saxophone mirror. + 

Now, here's the bass label. + 

And finally, why don't you blow a note on the French horn of tactical silence? But in a real negotiation, the band all plays together. + 

So, you've got to learn how to conduct. + 

Keeping all the instruments playing is really awkward for most people. + 

It seems to go by in such a rush. + 

So, what I'm going to do here is play a song at slow speed so you can hear each instrument note by note. + 

I promise you'll quickly see how the skills you have been building play off one another. + 

Rising, riffing, falling, and pausing in perfect harmony. + 

Here is the situation, the song, if you will. + 

My student Ryan B was flying from Baltimore to Austin to sign a large computer consulting contract. + 

For 6 months, the client representative had gone back and forth on whether he wanted the services. + 

But a major system collapse put the representative in a tight spot with his CEO. + 

To shift the blame, he called Ryan with his CEO on the line and very aggressively demanded to know why it was taking Ryan so long to come ink the contract. + 

If Ryan was not there by Friday morning, he said the deal was off. + 

Ryan bought a ticket for the next morning, Thursday, but a freak lightning storm whipped up in Baltimore, closing the airport for 5 hours. + 

It became painfully clear that Ryan wasn't going to make his original connection to Austin from Dallas. + 

Worse, when he called American Airlines just before departing, he found that his connection had been automatically rebooked to 300 p.m. + 

the next day, putting the contract in jeopardy. + 

When Ryan finally got to Dallas at 8:00 p.m., he ran to the gate where the day's final American Airlines flight to Austin was less than 30 minutes from takeoff. + 

His goal was to get on that flight, or at worst, get an earlier flight the next day. + 

In front of him at the gate, a very aggressive couple was yelling at the gate agent who was barely looking at them as she tapped on the computer in front of her. + 

She was clearly making every effort not to scream back. + 

After she'd said, "There's nothing I can do five times." The angry couple finally gave up and left. + 

To start, watch how Ryan turns that heated exchange to his advantage. + 

Following on the heels of an argument is a great position for a negotiator because your counterpart is desperate for an empathetic connection. + 

Smile and you're already an improvement. + 

Hi Wendy, I'm Ryan. + 

It seems like they were pretty upset. + 

This labels the negative and establishes a rapport based on empathy. + 

This in turn encourages Wendy to elaborate on her situation. + 

Words Ryan then mirrors to invite her to go further. + 

Yeah, they missed their connection. + 

We've had a fair amount of delays because of the weather. + 

The weather. + 

After Wendy explains how the delays in the Northeast had rippled through the system, Ryan again labels the negative and then mirrors her answer to encourage her to delve further. + 

It seems like it's been a hectic day. + 

There have been a lot of irate consumers, you know. + 

I mean, I get it. + 

Even though I don't like to be yelled at, a lot of people are trying to get to Austin for the big game. + 

The big game. + 

UT is playing Miss football and every flight into Austin has been booked solid. + 

Booked solid. + 

Now, let's pause. + 

Up to this point, Ryan has been using labels and mirrors to build a relationship with Wendy. + 

To her, it must seem like idol chatter, though, because he hasn't asked for anything. + 

Unlike the angry couple, Ryan is acknowledging her situation. + 

His words pingpong between, "What's that?" and, "I hear you." Both of which invite her to elaborate. + 

Now that the empathy has been built, she lets slip a piece of information he can use. + 

Yeah. + 

All through the weekend, though, who knows how many people will make the flights. + 

The weather's probably going to reroute a lot of people through a lot of different places. + 

Here's where Ryan finally swoops in with an ask. + 

But notice how he acts. + 

Not assertive or coldly logical, but with empathy and labeling that acknowledges her situation and tacitly puts them in the same boat. + 

Well, it seems like you've been handling the rough day pretty well. + 

He says, "I was also affected by the weather delays and missed my connecting flight. + 

It seems like this flight is likely booked solid, but with what you said, maybe someone affected by the weather might miss this connection. + 

Is there any possibility a seat will be open? Listen to that riff. + 

Label tactical empathy label, and only then a request. + 

At this point, Wendy says nothing and begins typing on her computer. + 

Ryan, who's eager not to talk himself out of a possible deal, engages in some silence. + 

After 30 seconds, Wendy prints a boarding pass and hands it to Ryan, explaining that there were a few seats that were supposed to be filled by people who would now arrive much later than the flight's departure. + 

To make Ryan's success even better, she puts him in economy plus seating. + 

All that in under 2 minutes. + 

The next time you find yourself following an angry customer at a corner store or airplane line, take a moment and practice labels and mirrors on the service person. + 

I promise they won't scream, "Don't try to control me." and burst into flames, and you might walk away with a little more than you expected. + 

Key lessons. + 

As you try to insert the tools of tactical empathy into your daily life, I encourage you to think of them as extensions of natural human interactions and not artificial conversational ticks. + 

In any interaction, it pleases us to feel that the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation. + 

Whether you are negotiating a business deal or simply chatting to the person at the supermarket butcher counter, creating an empathetic relationship and encouraging your counterpart to expand on their situation is the basis of healthy human interaction. + 

These tools then are nothing less than emotional best practices that help you cure the pervasive ineptitude that marks our most critical conversations in life. + 

They will help you connect and create more meaningful and warm relationships. + 

That they might help you extract what you want is a bonus. + 

Human connection is the first goal. + 

With that in mind, I encourage you to take the risk of sprinkling these in every conversation you have. + 

I promise you that they will feel awkward and artificial at first, but keep at it. + 

Learning to walk felt awfully strange, too. + 

As you internalize these techniques, turning the artifice of tactical empathy into a habit and then into an integral part of your personality, keep in mind these lessons from the chapter you've just read. + 

Imagine yourself in your counterpart's situation. + 

The beauty of empathy is that it doesn't demand that you agree with the other person's ideas. + 

You may well find them crazy. + 

But by acknowledging the other person's situation, you immediately convey that you are listening. + 

And once they know that you are listening, they may tell you something that you can use. + 

The reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal. + 

So, focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement. + 

Denying barriers or negative influences gives them credence. + 

Get them into the open. + 

Pause. + 

After you label a barrier or mirror a statement, let it sink in. + 

Don't worry, the other party will fill the silence. + 

Label your counterparts fears to diffuse their power. + 

We all want to talk about the happy stuff, but remember, the faster you interrupt action in your counterpart's amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust. + 

List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can. + 

Performing an accusation audit in advance prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. + 

And because these accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true. + 

Remember, you're dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood. + 

So, use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics. +
