当你将倾听者的柔道付诸实践时，请记住以下这些强有力的经验教训。##**不要试图强迫你的对手承认你是对的。**##好斗的对抗, 是"建设性谈判"的大敌。

避免提出那些可以用"是"或"极少量信息来回答的"问题。这类问题几乎不需要思考，并且会激起人类互惠的需求。对方会期望你有所回报。**要提出以"如何"或"什么"开头的精心设计的问题。**通过含蓄地向对方寻求帮助，*这些问题会给你的对手一种掌控感的错觉，并会促使他们详细地阐述，从而揭示出重要信息。*

[.my2]
**不要问以"为什么"开头的问题，除非你想让你的对手去捍卫一个对你有益的目标。##在任何语言中，"为什么"都总是一种指责。##*精心设计你的问题，将你的对手引向解决你的问题。*##这将鼓励他们花费精力来设计解决方案。

Bite (v.) your tongue 忍住不说；保持沉默. When you'*re attacked* 攻击；抨击 in a negotiation, pause 暂停；停顿 and avoid (v.) angry 愤怒的 emotional 情绪的；感情的反应. Instead, ask your counterpart a calibrated question.

要忍住不说。当你在谈判中受到攻击时，请暂停一下，避免做出愤怒的情绪化反应。相反，向对方提出一个精心设计的问题。对方总是一个团队。如果你无法影响到谈判桌后的那些人，你就会处于弱势。

into your daily life. Remember that these are listeners tools. They are not about strongarming your opponent into submission. Rather, they're about using the counterpart's power to get to your objective. They're listener's judo. As you put listener's judo into practice, remember the following powerful lessons. Don't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation. Avoid questions that can be answered with yes or tiny pieces of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity. You will be expected to give something back. Ask calibrated questions that start with the words how or what. By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information. Don't ask questions that start with why unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. Why is always an accusation in any language. Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart towards solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on devising a solution. Bite your tongue. When you're attacked in a negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a calibrated question. There is always a team on the other side. If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable. [Music]
