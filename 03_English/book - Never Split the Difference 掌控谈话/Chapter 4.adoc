很多人都会陷入一个陷阱，就是按字面意思理解别人说的话。

I started to see that while people played the game of conversation 对话游戏, it was in the game beneath the game 表面之下的博弈 where few played that all the leverage 影响力 lived.

[.my2]
我开始意识到，虽然人们在进行对话“游戏”，但所有的影响力都存在于“表面之下的博弈”中——很少有人会参与到这个层面的博弈。

But then I realized 意识到 I did the same thing 做同样的事 with my teenage son 十几岁的儿子 and that after I'd said no to him, I often found that I was open to 愿意 hearing what he had to say 他要说的话.

[.my2]
但后来我意识到，我对我十几岁的儿子也会这样——在对他说“不”之后，我常常发现自己愿意听他要说的话。

它很少意味着“我已经考虑了所有事实并做出了理性选择”。

相反，“不”往往是一个暂时的决定，目的是维持现状。

When I read Camp's book 坎普的书, I realized 意识到 this was something we'd known as hostage negotiators 人质谈判专家 for years 多年.

[.my2]
当我读坎普的书时，我意识到这是我们这些人质谈判专家多年来一直都知道的事。

[.my2]
我们了解到，让劫持人质者出来的最快方法是花时间说服他们出来，而不是要求他们投降。

Demanding their surrender, telling them to come out 出来, always ended up 最终 creating 导致 a much longer standoff 更长时间的对峙 and occasionally 偶尔 actually contributed to 导致 death 死亡.

[.my2]
要求他们投降、让他们出来，最终总是会导致更长时间的对峙，偶尔甚至会导致死亡。

His negotiation style 谈判风格 is all me me ego ego ego 全是自我中心.

[.my2]
他的谈判风格完全是以自我为中心。

And when the people on the other side of the table 桌子对面的人 pick up 察觉到 those signals 信号, they're going to decide 决定 that it's best to politely 礼貌地, even furtively 偷偷地 ignore 无视 this Superman 超人 by saying yes.

[.my2]
当桌子对面的人察觉到这些信号时，他们会决定，最好的办法是礼貌地、甚至偷偷地对这个“超人”说“是”，以此来无视他。

Huh? You say, sure, the word they'll say right off 立刻 is yes.

[.my2]
“哈？”你会说，没错，他们立刻会说“是”。

But that word 那个词 is only a tool 工具 to get this blowhard 夸夸其谈的人 to go away 走开.

[.my2]
但这个词只是让这个夸夸其谈的人走开的工具。

They'll weasel out 逃避 later, claiming 声称 changing conditions 情况变化, budget issues 预算问题, the weather 天气.

[.my2]
他们之后会找借口逃避，声称情况有变、预算有问题、天气不好等等。

For now 现在, they just want to be released 解脱 because Joe isn't convincing 说服 them of anything.

[.my2]
现在，他们只是想解脱，因为乔根本没有说服他们任何事。

He's only convincing himself 说服他自己.

[.my2]
他只是在说服自己。

I'll let you in on a secret 告诉你一个秘密.

[.my2]
我再告诉你一个秘密。

There are actually 实际上 three kinds of yes: counterfeit 虚假的, confirmation 确认性的, and commitment 承诺性的.

[.my2]
实际上，“是”有三种：虚假的“是”、确认性的“是”和承诺性的“是”。

A counterfeit yes is one in which your counterpart 对方 plans on 打算 saying no, but either feels yes is an easier escape route 逃避途径 or just wants to disingenuously 不真诚地 keep the conversation going 继续谈话 to obtain 获取 more information 信息 or some other kind of edge 优势.

[.my2]
虚假的“是”是指对方本打算说“不”，但要么觉得说“是”是更容易的逃避途径，要么只是想不真诚地继续谈话以获取更多信息或其他某种优势。

A confirmation yes is generally 通常 innocent 无关紧要的, a reflexive response 本能反应 to a black or white question 非黑即白的问题.

[.my2]
确认性的“是”通常无关紧要，是对非黑即白问题的本能反应。

It's sometimes used to 被用来 lay a trap 设陷阱, but mostly 主要地 it's just simple affirmation 确认 with no promise of action 行动承诺 and a commitment 承诺.

[.my2]
它有时被用来设陷阱，但主要只是简单的确认，没有行动承诺和承诺的意味。

Yes is the real deal 真正的承诺.

[.my2]
承诺性的“是”才是真正的承诺。

It's a true agreement 真正的协议 that leads to 导致 action 行动.

[.my2]
它是能带来行动的真正协议。

A yes at the table 谈判桌上的“是” that ends with 以……结束 a signature 签名 on the contract 合同.

[.my2]
是谈判桌上那种最终以在合同上签字收尾的“是”。

The commitment yes is what you want 你想要的, but the three types 类型 sound almost the same 几乎一样.

[.my2]
承诺性的“是”是你想要的，但这三种“是”听起来几乎一样。

So you have to learn how to recognize 识别 which one is being used 被使用.

[.my2]
所以你必须学会识别正在使用的是哪一种。

Human beings 人类 the world over 全世界 are so used to 习惯于 being pursued 被极力劝说 for the commitment yes as a condition 作为条件 to find out more 了解更多 that they have become masters 高手 at giving the counterfeit yes.

[.my2]
全世界的人都太习惯于被人极力劝说给出承诺性的“是”（以此作为了解更多信息的条件），以至于他们都成了给出虚假“是”的高手。

That's what the people facing 面对 Joe businessmen 商人乔们 are doing.

[.my2]
这就是面对商人乔们的那些人正在做的事。

Dangling 抛出 the counterfeit yes so they can hear more 了解更多.

[.my2]
抛出虚假的“是”，这样他们就能了解更多情况。

Whether you call it buy-in 认同 or engagement 参与 or something else 别的什么, good negotiators 优秀的谈判者 know that their job 工作 isn't to put on a great performance 表现出色, but to gently 温和地 guide 引导 their counterpart 对方 to discover 发现 their goal 目标 as his own 自己的.

[.my2]
无论你称之为“认同”“参与”还是别的什么，优秀的谈判者都知道，他们的工作不是表现出色，而是温和地引导对方，让对方将他们的目标视为自己的目标。

Let me tell you, I learned that the hard way 通过艰难的方式.

[.my2]
告诉你吧，我是通过艰难的方式才明白这一点的。

2 months 两个月 after talking with Amy, I started answering phones 接电话 for helpline 求助热线, the crisis hotline 危机热线 founded by 由……创立 Norman Vincent Peale（诺曼·文森特·皮尔，美国励志作家）.

[.my2]
和埃米谈过两个月后，我开始为“求助热线”接电话，这是一条由诺曼·文森特·皮尔创立的危机热线。

The basic rule 基本规则 was that you couldn't be with anybody on the phone 和任何人通电话 for more than 20 minutes 超过20分钟.

[.my2]
基本规则是，和任何人通电话都不能超过20分钟。

If you did your job 做好你的工作, it wasn't going to take you longer than that 用不了那么久 to get them to a better place 让他们心情好起来.

[.my2]
如果你工作做得好，用不了那么久就能让他们心情好起来。

We had a thick book 厚厚的一本 of organizations 机构 we referred them to 推荐他们去 for help 寻求帮助.

[.my2]
我们有一本厚厚的册子，里面是我们可以推荐他们去寻求帮助的机构。

It was a paramedic approach 急救式方法.

[.my2]
这是一种急救式的方法。

Patch them up 简单处理 and send them on their way 让他们离开.

[.my2]
简单处理一下，就让他们离开了。

But people in crisis 处于危机中的人 only accounted for 占 about 40% of the calls 来电 we got.

[.my2]
但处于危机中的人打来的电话只占我们接到的来电的40%左右。

The majority of 大多数 the calls came from 来自 frequent callers 频繁来电者.

[.my2]
大多数来电来自频繁来电者。

These are highly dysfunctional people 有严重心理问题的人, energy vampires 精力吸血鬼 whom no one else would listen to 听……说话 anymore 再.

[.my2]
这些人是有严重心理问题的人，是“精力吸血鬼”，其他人都不愿意再听他们说话了。

We kept a list of 记录了……的名单 frequent callers.

[.my2]
我们记录了频繁来电者的名单。

And when you got one 接到一个这样的来电, the first thing 第一件事 you had to do 你必须做 was check 核实 to see if the person had called that day 那天打过电话 because they were only allowed 被允许 one call a day 一天一个电话.

[.my2]
当你接到一个这样的来电时，你必须做的第一件事是核实这个人当天是否已经打过电话，因为他们每天只被允许打一个电话。

They knew it 这一点 too 也.

[.my2]
他们也知道这一点。

A lot of times 很多时候 they'd say, "Yeah, I'm Eddie.

[.my2]
很多时候他们会说：“是的，我是埃迪。

I haven't called yet today 今天还没打过电话.

[.my2]
“我今天还没打过电话。

Go ahead and check the list 名单.

[.my2]
“你去查一下名单吧。

You got to 必须 talk to me 跟我说话." Since I was there primarily 主要地 to learn a skill 技能, I loved 喜欢 the frequent callers.

[.my2]
“你必须跟我说话。”因为我去那里主要是为了学习技能，所以我喜欢这些频繁来电者。

They were a problem 难题 and I loved trying to 喜欢努力去 figure them out 弄明白他们.

[.my2]
他们是一个难题，我喜欢努力去弄明白他们。

I felt I had some talent 天赋 at it.

[.my2]
我觉得自己在这方面有些天赋。

I felt like 感觉像 a superstar 超级明星.

[.my2]
我感觉自己像个超级明星。

When it came time for 当……的时候 my performance review 绩效评估, they assigned 指派 me a shift supervisor 值班主管 named Jim Snyder.

[.my2]
到了我的绩效评估时间，他们给我指派了一位名叫吉姆·斯奈德的值班主管。

Jim was a hotline veteran 热线老手 and a sweetheart 和蔼可亲的人.

[.my2]
吉姆是热线的老手，也是个和蔼可亲的人。

The only problem 唯一的问题 was he always wanted to joke around 开玩笑.

[.my2]
唯一的问题是他总是喜欢开玩笑。

Jim understood 明白 that volunteer burnout 志愿者倦怠 was the biggest problem 最大的问题 at a hotline.

[.my2]
吉姆明白，志愿者倦怠是热线最大的问题。

So, he dedicated his time to 致力于 making work fun 让工作有趣.

[.my2]
所以，他致力于让工作变得有趣。

I became good friends with 成为……的好朋友 Jim.

[.my2]
我和吉姆成了好朋友。

For my review 为了我的评估, Jim waited until 等到 I got a call 接到一个电话 and went into 走进 the monitoring room 监听室 where the supervisors 主管 could listen to 听 our calls 我们的通话.

[.my2]
为了我的评估，吉姆一直等到我接到一个电话，然后走进了监听室——主管们在那里可以监听我们的通话。

The call was from 来自 one of my frequent clients 常客, a cabbie 出租车司机 with a fear of 害怕 going outside 外出 and plenty of time 充足的时间 to tell me about it 告诉我这件事.

[.my2]
这个电话来自我的一个常客，他是一名出租车司机，害怕外出，而且有充足的时间跟我讲这件事。

This energy vampire 精力吸血鬼, his name was Daryl, launched into 开始滔滔不绝地说 his shtick 老一套 about how he was going to lose his house 失去他的房子 and with it 随之 his will to live 活下去的意志 if he couldn't work 不能工作.

[.my2]
这个“精力吸血鬼”名叫达里尔，他开始滔滔不绝地说他那套老掉牙的话——如果他不能工作，他就会失去房子，随之也会失去活下去的意志。

"Seriously 说真的, when was the last time 上一次 someone tried to hurt 伤害 you on the streets 在街上?" I asked.

[.my2]
“说真的，上一次有人在街上试图伤害你是什么时候？”我问道。

"Well, I mean, it's been a long time 很长时间了," Daryl said.

[.my2]
“嗯，我的意思是，已经过去很长时间了，”达里尔说。

"Like, I can't really remember 记得 a date 日期, Chris.

[.my2]
“我真的记不清具体日期了，克里斯。

Maybe a year 一年, I guess 我猜." So, it's safe to say 可以肯定地说 that the outside world 外面的世界 hasn't been too hard on 对……太苛刻 you, right? Yes, Daryl said.

[.my2]
“我猜大概一年了吧。”“所以，可以肯定地说，外面的世界对你不算太苛刻，对吧？”“是的，”达里尔说。

I suppose so 我想是这样.

[.my2]
“我想是这样。”

We went back and forth 反复沟通 like this for a while as I made him admit 承认 that most of us had little to fear 没什么可害怕的 in the world.

[.my2]
我们这样反复沟通了一会儿，我让他承认，我们大多数人在这个世界上没什么可害怕的。

I was feeling good about 对……感觉良好 my new skills 新技能, about listening to 倾听 Daryl and then carefronting 关怀式对峙 him, which was the slightly goofy 有点滑稽的 name we gave to assertively 坚定地 but caringly 关怀地 responding to 回应 frequent callers 频繁来电者.

[.my2]
我对自己的新技能感觉很好——既能倾听达里尔，又能对他进行“关怀式对峙”（这是我们给“坚定且关怀地回应频繁来电者”起的有点滑稽的名字）。

It was all flowing 进展顺利 and our rapport 融洽关系 was great 很好.

[.my2]
一切都很顺利，我们的关系也很融洽。

I even got Daryl to laugh 笑 a few times 几次.

[.my2]
我甚至让达里尔笑了好几次。

By the time I was done with him 和他沟通完, he couldn't give me one reason 理由 not to step outside 出门.

[.my2]
等我和他沟通完，他根本说不出一个不出门的理由。

"Thank you, Chris," Daryl said just before he hung up 挂断电话.

[.my2]
“谢谢你，克里斯。”达里尔挂断电话前说。

"Thanks for doing such a great job 做得这么好." Before I went to see Jim, I leaned back 向后靠 in my chair 椅子 and basked in 沉浸在 that compliment 赞美中.

[.my2]
“谢谢你做得这么好。”去见吉姆之前，我向后靠在椅子上，沉浸在这份赞美中。

"How often do you get that from a man in pain 痛苦中的人?" I thought 心想.

[.my2]
“你能从一个痛苦中的人那里得到这样的评价，有多常见呢？”我心想。

Then I sprung up 猛地站起来 and strode 大步走 toward the monitoring room 监听室, so proud 自豪的 I was practically buffing my nails 擦指甲 on my shirt 衬衫 and patting my own back 自我表扬.

[.my2]
然后我猛地站起来，大步走向监听室，自豪得几乎要用衬衫擦指甲，还不停地自我表扬。

Jim motioned 示意 me to the chair 椅子 in front of him and gave me his biggest smile 最灿烂的笑容.

[.my2]
吉姆示意我坐到他面前的椅子上，给了我一个最灿烂的笑容。

I must have returned it with twice the wattage 亮度.

[.my2]
我回敬他的笑容，亮度肯定是他的两倍。

"Well, Chris," he said, still smiling 微笑着, that was one of the worst calls 最糟糕的通话 I ever heard 听过.

[.my2]
“嗯，克里斯，”他仍然微笑着说，“这是我听过的最糟糕的通话之一。”

I stared at him 盯着他, gaping 目瞪口呆的.

[.my2]
我目瞪口呆地盯着他。

Jim, did you hear Daryl congratulate 祝贺 me? I asked 问.

[.my2]
“吉姆，你没听到达里尔祝贺我吗？”我问道。

I talked him down 说服他冷静下来, man 伙计.

[.my2]
“伙计，我说服他冷静下来了。

I killed it 做得太棒了.

[.my2]
“我做得太棒了。”

Jim smiled 微笑了.

[.my2]
吉姆微笑了。

I hated that smile 讨厌那个微笑 right then 当时 and nodded 点头.

[.my2]
当时我很讨厌那个微笑，点了点头。

That's one of the signs 迹象 because they should be congratulating themselves 自我祝贺 when they get off the line 挂断电话.

[.my2]
“这就是迹象之一，因为他们挂断电话时应该自我祝贺。”

He said, "They don't need to be congratulating you 祝贺你.

[.my2]
他说：“他们不需要祝贺你。

That tells me you did too much 做得太多了.

[.my2]
“这说明你做得太多了。

If they think you did it, if you were the guy who killed it 做得太棒的人, how is he going to help himself 自助? I don't want to be harsh 严厉的, but you were horrible 糟糕的.

[.my2]
“如果他们觉得是你做到的，觉得你是那个‘做得太棒的人’，那他怎么学会自助呢？我不想说得太严厉，但你做得很糟糕。”

As I listened to 听 what Jim said, I felt that acid stomach rush 胃部一阵反酸 you get when you are forced to accept 被迫接受 that the guy dumping on you 批评你的人 is completely right 完全正确.

[.my2]
听着吉姆的话，我感到胃部一阵反酸——那种当你被迫接受批评你的人完全正确时的感觉。

Daryl's response 回应 had been a kind of yes, but it had been anything but 根本不是 a true commitment yes 承诺性的“是”.

[.my2]
达里尔的回应算是一种“是”，但根本不是真正的承诺性“是”。

He'd made no promise to action 行动承诺.

[.my2]
他没有做出任何行动承诺。

His yes had been designed to 旨在 make me feel good enough to leave him alone 不打扰他.

[.my2]
他的“是”旨在让我感觉良好，从而不再打扰他。

Daryl may not have known it 知道, but his yes was as counterfeit 虚假的 as they came 可能的.

[.my2]
达里尔可能不知道，但他的“是”是最虚假的那种。

You see, that whole call 整个通话 had been about me 关于我 and my ego 我的自我 and not the caller 来电者.

[.my2]
你看，整个通话都围绕着我和我的自我，而不是来电者。

But the only way 唯一方法 to get these callers 这些来电者 to take action 采取行动 was to have them own the conversation 主导对话, to believe 相信 that they were coming to these conclusions 得出这些结论, to these necessary next steps 这些必要的下一步, and that the voice at the other end 电话那头的声音 was simply 仅仅是 a medium 媒介 for those realizations 那些领悟.

[.my2]
但要让这些来电者采取行动，唯一的方法是让他们主导对话，让他们相信是自己得出了这些结论、想到了这些必要的下一步，而电话那头的声音仅仅是这些领悟的媒介。

Using all your skills 运用所有技能 to create 建立 rapport 融洽关系, agreement 共识, and connection 联系 with a counterpart 对方 is useful 有用的, but ultimately 最终 that connection is useless 无用的 unless 除非 the other person feels 觉得 that they are equally as responsible 同样负责任的, if not solely responsible 即使不是唯一负责任的, for creating the connection and the new ideas 新想法 they have.

[.my2]
运用所有技能与对方建立融洽关系、达成共识和联系是有用的，但最终这种联系是无用的——除非对方觉得，即使不是唯一负责任，他们也对建立这种联系和产生自己的新想法同样负责任。

I nodded slowly 慢慢点头.

[.my2]
我慢慢点了点头。

The fight drained out of me 斗志全无.

[.my2]
我的斗志全无了。

One of the worst calls 最糟糕的通话, I said to Jim, "That's right 没错." I worked hard at 努力 reorienting myself 重新定位自己 from that point on 从那时起.

[.my2]
“最糟糕的通话之一，”我对吉姆说，“没错。”从那时起，我努力重新定位自己。

I asked so many questions 问了很多问题 and read so much about it 读了很多相关内容 that soon they had me teaching 教 two classes 两门课 for new volunteers 新志愿者 at Helpline 求助热线.

[.my2]
我问了很多问题，读了很多相关内容，很快他们就让我在求助热线给新志愿者教两门课。

The opening class 入门课 on active listening 积极倾听 and the one on carefronting 关怀式对峙.

[.my2]
一门是关于积极倾听的入门课，另一门是关于关怀式对峙的课。

Got it 明白了.

[.my2]
明白了。

You say it's not about me 与我无关.

[.my2]
你说这与我无关。

We need to persuade 说服 from their perspective 他们的视角, not ours 我们的.

[.my2]
我们需要从他们的视角去说服，而不是从我们的视角。

But how 怎么做? By starting with 从……开始 their most basic wants 最基本的需求.

[.my2]
但怎么做呢？从他们最基本的需求开始。

In every negotiation 谈判, in every agreement 协议, the result 结果 comes from 来自 someone else's decision 别人的决定.

[.my2]
在每一场谈判、每一份协议中，结果都来自别人的决定。

And sadly 遗憾地, if we believe 认为 that we can control 控制 or manage 影响 others decisions 别人的决定 with compromise 妥协 and logic 逻辑, we're leaving millions on the table 错失巨额利益.

[.my2]
遗憾的是，如果我们认为可以通过妥协和逻辑来控制或影响别人的决定，我们就会错失巨额利益。

But while 虽然 we can't control 控制 others decisions, we can influence 影响 them by inhabiting their world 融入他们的世界 and seeing and hearing exactly 准确地 what they want 他们想要的.

[.my2]
但虽然我们无法控制别人的决定，却可以通过融入他们的世界、准确地了解他们想要的东西来影响他们。

Though 尽管 the intensity 强度 may differ from person to person 因人而异, you can be sure that everyone you meet is driven by 受……驱使 two primal urges 原始冲动.

[.my2]
尽管强度可能因人而异，但你可以肯定，你遇到的每个人都受两种原始冲动的驱使。

the need to feel safe and secure 安全的需求 and the need to feel in control 掌控的需求.

[.my2]
即感到安全的需求和感到掌控的需求。

If you satisfy 满足 those drives 驱动力, you're in the door 迈出了第一步.

[.my2]
如果你满足了这些驱动力，你就迈出了第一步。

As we saw with 正如我们从……看到的 my chat 聊天 with Daryl, you're not going to logically 逻辑上 convince 说服 them that they're safe, secure 安全的, or in control 掌控的.

[.my2]
正如我们从与达里尔的聊天中看到的，你无法从逻辑上说服他们，让他们相信自己是安全的、有掌控力的。

Primal needs 原始需求 are urgent 迫切的 and illogical 不合逻辑的.

[.my2]
原始需求是迫切且不合逻辑的。

So, arguing them into a corner 把他们逼到墙角 is just going to push 迫使 your counterpart 对方 to flee 逃避 with a counterfeit yes 虚假的“是”.

[.my2]
所以，把他们逼到墙角只会迫使对方用虚假的“是”来逃避。

And being nice 表现友好 in the form of 以……的形式 feigned sympathy 假意同情 is often equally as unsuccessful 同样不成功的.

[.my2]
而以假意同情的形式表现友好，往往也同样不成功。

We live in an age 时代 that celebrates 推崇 niceness 友好 under various names 各种名义.

[.my2]
我们生活在一个以各种名义推崇友好的时代。

We are exhorted to 被劝诫 be nice 友好 and to respect 尊重 people's feelings 人们的感受 at all times 任何时候 and in every situation 任何情况.

[.my2]
我们被劝诫在任何时候、任何情况下都要友好，尊重别人的感受。

But nice alone 仅仅友好 in the context of 在……背景下 negotiation 谈判 can backfire 适得其反.

[.my2]
但在谈判背景下，仅仅友好可能适得其反。

Nice employed as a ruse 被用作诡计的友好 is disingenuous 不真诚的 and manipulative 操纵性的.

[.my2]
被用作诡计的友好是不真诚且具有操纵性的。

Who hasn't received the short end of the stick 吃亏 in dealings with 与……打交道 a nice salesman 友好的推销员 who took you for a ride 欺骗你.

[.my2]
谁没有在和欺骗你的“友好”推销员打交道时吃过亏呢？

If you rush in with 带着……匆忙行事 plastic niceness 虚假的友好, your bland smile 平淡的微笑 is going to dredge up 勾起 all that baggage 不愉快的回忆.

[.my2]
如果你带着虚假的友好匆忙行事，你平淡的微笑只会勾起所有那些不愉快的回忆。

Instead of 而不是 getting inside 深入 with logic 逻辑 or feigned smiles 假意的微笑, then we get there by asking for 寻求 no.

[.my2]
与其用逻辑或假意的微笑深入对方内心，不如通过寻求“不”来实现。

It's the word 词 that gives the speaker 说话者 feelings of safety 安全感 and control 掌控感.

[.my2]
“不”这个词能给说话者带来安全感和掌控感。

No starts conversations 开启对话 and creates 创造 safe havens 安全空间 to get to 到达 the final yes 最终的“是” of commitment 承诺.

[.my2]
“不”能开启对话，创造安全空间，从而达到最终的承诺性“是”。

An early yes 过早的“是” is often just a cheap 廉价的 counterfeit dodge 虚假的逃避.

[.my2]
过早的“是”往往只是一种廉价的虚假逃避。

About 5 months 5个月 after she'd told me to go away 走开, I stopped by 顺便拜访 Amy Bono's office 办公室 and told her that I'd volunteered 做志愿者 at Helpline 求助热线.

[.my2]
在她让我走开大约五个月后，我顺便拜访了埃米·博诺的办公室，告诉她我在求助热线做了志愿者。

"You did?" she asked, smiling with surprise 惊讶地笑着.

[.my2]
“你真的去了？”她惊讶地笑着问道。

"I tell everybody to do that, and nobody ever does." It turned out 结果是 that Amy had started her negotiating career 谈判生涯 by volunteering 做志愿者 at the same place 同一个地方.

[.my2]
“我告诉所有人都去做，但从来没人真的去。”结果发现，埃米的谈判生涯就是从在同一个地方做志愿者开始的。

She started naming 说出 names of people who were now mutual friends 共同朋友 of ours.

[.my2]
她开始说出一些现在是我们共同朋友的人的名字。

We laughed about 聊到……时笑了 Jim.

[.my2]
我们聊到吉姆时笑了。

In a sudden shift 突然转变, Amy stopped speaking 停止说话 and stared at 盯着 me.

[.my2]
突然，埃米停止说话，盯着我。

I shifted in my shoes 不安地挪动脚步 as she gave me the pause 停顿.

[.my2]
她停顿着，我不安地挪动脚步。

Then she smiled 微笑了.

[.my2]
然后她微笑了。

You get the next position 职位.

[.my2]
“下一个职位是你的了。”

At that time 当时, there were five other people 另外五个人 aiming for 争取 the same slot 职位.

[.my2]
当时，还有另外五个人在争取同一个职位。

people who had psychology degrees 心理学学位, experience 经验, and credentials 资历.

[.my2]
那些人有心理学学位、经验和资历。

But I was on the road to 正在前往 the next hostage negotiation training course 下一期人质谈判培训课程 at the FBI Academy 联邦调查局学院 in Quantico 匡蒂科, Virginia 弗吉尼亚州, ahead of 领先于 everybody else 其他人.

[.my2]
但我却领先于所有人，即将前往弗吉尼亚州匡蒂科的联邦调查局学院参加下一期人质谈判培训课程。

My career as a negotiator 谈判者生涯 had officially 正式地 begun 开始.

[.my2]
我的谈判者生涯正式开始了。

No is protection 保护.

[.my2]
“不”是一种保护。

Think back to 回想一下 the telemarketer 电话销售员 at the beginning of this chapter 本章开头.

[.my2]
回想一下本章开头的那个电话销售员。

The obvious reply 明显的回答 to his question, "Do you enjoy 喜欢 a nice glass of water 一杯好水?" is yes.

[.my2]
对他的问题“你喜欢喝一杯好水吗？”，最明显的回答是“是”。

But all you want to do is scream 大喊 no.

[.my2]
但你只想大喊“不”。

After a question like that, you just know 知道 the rest of the phone call 通话的剩余部分 is going to be painful 痛苦的.

[.my2]
听到这样的问题后，你就知道通话的剩余部分会很痛苦。


That in a nutshell 简而言之 distills 提炼 the inherent contradictions 内在矛盾 in the values 价值观 we give yes and no.

[.my2]
这简而言之提炼出了我们赋予“是”和“不”的价值观中的内在矛盾。

Whenever 每当 we negotiate 谈判, there's no doubt 毫无疑问 we want to finish with 以……结束 a yes.

[.my2]
无论何时谈判，毫无疑问我们都想以“是”收尾。

But we mistakenly 错误地 conflate 混淆 the positive value 积极价值 of that final yes 最终的“是” with a positive value of yes in general 一般意义上的“是”.

[.my2]
但我们错误地将最终“是”的积极价值与一般意义上“是”的积极价值混为一谈。

And because 因为 we see no as the opposite of 作为……的对立面 yes, we then assume 认为 that no is always a bad thing 坏事.

[.my2]
而且因为我们把“不”看作“是”的对立面，所以就认为“不”总是坏事。

Nothing could be further from the truth 完全不是这样.

[.my2]
事实完全不是这样。

Saying no gives the speaker 说话者 the feeling of safety 安全感, security 安稳感, and control 掌控感.

[.my2]
说“不”能给说话者带来安全感、安稳感和掌控感。

You use a question 问题 that prompts 促使 a no answer 否定回答 and your counterpart 对方 feels that by turning you down 拒绝你, he has proved 证明 that he's in the driver's seat 掌控局面.

[.my2]
你用一个能促使对方回答“不”的问题，对方会觉得通过拒绝你，自己证明了能掌控局面。

Good negotiators 优秀的谈判者 welcome 欢迎, even invite 主动寻求 a solid 明确的 no to start 作为开始 as a sign 迹象 that the other party 对方 is engaged 参与其中 and thinking 思考.

[.my2]
优秀的谈判者欢迎甚至主动寻求以明确的“不”作为开始，将其视为对方参与其中并进行思考的迹象。

Gun for 急于求得 a yes straight off the bat 立刻, though 然而, and your counterpart gets defensive 产生防御心理, wary 警惕的, and skittish 不安的.

[.my2]
然而，若急于立刻求得“是”，对方就会产生防御心理、变得警惕且不安。

That's why 这就是为什么 I tell my students 告诉我的学生 that if you're trying to sell something 推销东西, don't start with 以……开始, "Do you have a few minutes to talk?" Instead 相反, ask 问, "Is now a bad time to talk?" Either 要么 you get 得到, "Yes, it is a bad time," followed by 接着是 a good time 合适的时间 or a request 要求 to go away 走开, or you get 要么得到, "No, it's not." and total focus 全神贯注.

[.my2]
这就是为什么我告诉学生，如果想推销东西，不要以“你有几分钟时间聊聊吗？”开头，相反，要问“现在是不是不方便聊天？”要么你会得到“是的，现在不方便”，接着对方会给出合适的时间或让你走开；要么你会得到“不，不不方便”，然后对方会全神贯注地和你聊。

As an exercise 作为练习, the next time 下次 you get a telemarketing call 电话销售来电, write down 写下 the questions 问题 the seller 销售员 asks.

[.my2]

[.my2]
“您能提供一下信用卡号，从而参与到这场改变中来吗？”至少从理论上讲，这些肯定回答积累了大量积极情绪，在脚本末尾请求捐款时，这些情绪本应转化为捐款。

The problem 问题 in reality 实际上 was that the yes pattern scripts 肯定模式脚本 had been giving poor rates of return 回报率低 for years 多年.

[.my2]
但实际问题是，这种肯定模式的脚本多年来回报率一直很低。

All the steps 步骤 were yes, but the final answer 最终答案 was invariably 总是 no.

[.my2]
前面所有步骤都是“是”，但最终答案却总是“不”。

但本是个聪明人。

所以他没有完全更换脚本，而是让一小群基层员工测试推广一个以“不”为导向的脚本。

See how clearly that swaps yes for no 用“不”代替“是” and offers to take a donation 提出接受捐款 if Mr.

[.my2]
看看这多么明显——用“不”代替了“是”，并在史密斯先生愿意的情况下提出接受捐款。

Smith wants.

[.my2]
（如果史密斯先生愿意的话）

It puts Mr.

[.my2]
这让史密斯先生

Smith in the driver's seat 掌控局面.

[.my2]
本的故事中唯一遗憾的是，尽管结果有了巨大改进，他却无法向所有筹款人推广这个脚本。

That forces them to listen 迫使他们倾听 and makes them comfortable correcting you 愿意纠正你 by saying, "No, that's not it.

[.my2]
这会迫使他们倾听，并让他们愿意纠正你，说：“不，不是那样的。

This is it." Another way 另一种方法 to force 迫使 no in a negotiation 谈判中 is to ask the other party 问对方 what they don't want 他们不想要什么.

[.my2]
“是这样的。”在谈判中迫使对方说“不”的另一种方法，是问他们不想要什么。

Let's talk about 谈谈 what you would say no to 你会对什么说“不”.

[.my2]

[.my2]
而且一旦你让他们说“不”，他们就会更愿意朝着新的选择和想法前进。

No, or the lack thereof 缺乏“不” also serves as 充当 a warning 警告, the canary in the coal mine（煤矿里的金丝雀，喻指预警信号）.

“不”，或者说缺乏“不”，也可以充当一种警告，就像“煤矿里的金丝雀”（预警信号）。

If despite 尽管 all your efforts 你的所有努力, the other party 对方 won't say no 不肯说“不”, you're dealing with 打交道 people who are indecisive 优柔寡断的 or confused 困惑的 or who have a hidden agenda 隐藏的动机.

如果尽管你付出了所有努力，对方还是不肯说“不”，那你面对的可能是优柔寡断、困惑的人，或者是有隐藏动机的人。

In cases like that 在这种情况下, you have to end 结束 the negotiation 谈判 and walk away 走开.

[.my2]
在这种情况下，你必须结束谈判并走开。

Think of it like this 可以这样理解.

== pure

Beware. + 

Yes, master. + 

No. + 

Let me paint a scenario we've all experienced. + 

You're at home just before dinner and the phone rings. + 

It is no surprise a telemarketer. + 

He wants to sell you magazine subscriptions, water filters, frozen Argentine beef. + 

To be honest, it doesn't matter as the script is always the same. + 

After butchering your name and engaging in some disingenuous pleasantries, he launches into his pitch. + 

The hard cell that comes next is a scripted flowchart designed to cut off your escape routes as it funnels you down a path with no exit. + 

But yes, do you enjoy a nice glass of water from time to time? Well, yes. + 

But me, too. + 

And like me, I bet you like crisp, clean water with no chemical aftertaste, like mother nature made it. + 

Well, yes. + 

But who is this guy with a fake smile in his voice? You wonder. + 

Who thinks he can trick you into buying something you don't want? You feel your muscles tighten, your voice go defensive, and your heart rate accelerate. + 

You feel like his prey, and you are. + 

The last thing you want to do is say yes, even when it's the only way to answer. + 

Do you drink water? Compromise and concession, even to the truth, feels like defeat. + 

And no, well, no feels like salvation, like an oasis. + 

You're tempted to use no when it's blatantly untrue, just to hear its sweet sound. + 

No, I do not need water, carbon filtered or otherwise. + 

I'm a camel. + 

Now, let's think about this selling technique. + 

It's designed to get to yes at all costs, as if no were death. + 

And for many of us, it is. + 

We have all these negative connotations with no. + 

We talk about the rejection of no, about the fear of hearing it. + 

No is the ultimate negative word. + 

But at the end of the day, yes is often a meaningless answer that hides deeper objections and maybe is even worse. + 

Pushing hard for yes doesn't get a negotiator any closer to a win. + 

It just angers the other side. + 

So if yes can be so damn uncomfortable and no such a relief, why have we fetishized one and demonized the other? We have it backward. + 

For good negotiators, no is pure gold. + 

That negative provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don't want. + 

No is a safe choice that maintains the status quo. + 

It provides a temporary oasis of control. + 

At some point in their development, all negotiators have to come to grips with no. + 

When you come to realize the real psychological dynamic behind it, you'll love the word. + 

It's not just that you lose your fear of it, but that you come to learn what it does for you and how you can build deals out of it. + 

Yes and maybe are often worthless. + 

But no always alters the conversation. + 

No starts the negotiation. + 

My fascination with no in all its beautiful nuance began with a conversation I had a few months before my negotiation career began. + 

I started my career with the bureau as a member of the FBI SWAT team in the Pittsburgh division. + 

But after nearly 2 years, I was transferred to New York where the FBI attached me to the joint terrorism task force. + 

It was an amazing post. + 

We spent our days and nights tracking suspected terrorists, investigating their cells, and assessing whether or how they might strike. + 

We were untying knots of human anger in the midst of America's biggest city, making life and death decisions on who was dangerous and who was just blowing hot air. + 

The work fascinated me. + 

Ever since my first days with the bureau, I had been obsessed with crisis response. + 

The immediacy of the task enthralled me. + 

The stakes were high. + 

Lives hung in the balance. + 

The emotional terrain was complex, changing, and often conflicting. + 

To successfully gain a hostage's safe release, a negotiator had to penetrate the hostage taker's motives, state of mind, intelligence, and emotional strengths and weaknesses. + 

The negotiator played the role of bully, consiliator, enforcer, savior, confessor, instigator, and peacemaker. + 

And that's just a few of the parts. + 

I thought I was cut out for every one of them. + 

A few weeks after I got to Manhattan, I showed up at the desk of Amy Bondo, who ran the FBI's crisis negotiation team in New York. + 

I didn't know beans about negotiating, so I went for the direct approach. + 

I want be a hostage negotiator, I said. + 

Everyone does. + 

Got any training? She asked. + 

No, I said. + 

Any credentials? Nope. + 

I answered. + 

Any experience? She asked. + 

No, I answered. + 

Do you have a degree in psychology, sociology, anything at all related to negotiation? No. + 

Looks like you answered your own question, she said. + 

No. + 

Now go away. + 

Go away? I protested. + 

Really? Yep. + 

As in, leave me alone. + 

Everybody wants to be a hostage negotiator, and you have no resume, experience, or skills. + 

So, what would you say in my position? You got it. + 

No. + 

I paused in front of her, thinking, "This is not how my negotiating career ends. + 

I had stared down terrorists. + 

I wasn't going to just leave." "Come on," I said. + 

"There has to be something I can do." Amy shook her head and gave one of those ironic laughs that mean the person doesn't think you've got a snowballs chance in hell. + 

"I'll tell you what. + 

Yes, there is something you can do. + 

Volunteer at a suicide hotline. + 

Then come talk to me. + 

No guarantees. + 

Got it. + 

She said now seriously, go away. + 

My conversation with Amy kicked off my awareness of the complex and hidden subtleties of conversation, the power of certain words, the seemingly unintelligible emotional truths that so often underly intelligible exchanges. + 

A trap into which many fall is to take what other people say literally. + 

I started to see that while people played the game of conversation, it was in the game beneath the game where few played that all the leverage lived. + 

In our chat, I saw how the word no, so apparently clear and direct, really wasn't so simple. + 

Over the years, I've thought back repeatedly to that conversation, replaying how Amy so quickly turned me down again and again. + 

But her nos were just the gateway to yes. + 

They gave her and me time to pivot, adjust, and re-examine, and actually created the environment for the one yes that mattered. + 

While assigned to the JTTF, I worked with an NYPD lieutenant named Martin. + 

He had a hard shell, and whenever asked for anything, he responded with a tur negative. + 

After I'd gotten to know him a bit, I asked him why. + 

Chris, he said proudly, a lieutenant's job is to say no. + 

At first, I thought that sort of automated response signaled a failure of imagination. + 

But then I realized I did the same thing with my teenage son and that after I'd said no to him, I often found that I was open to hearing what he had to say. + 

That's because having protected myself, I could relax and more easily consider the possibilities. + 

No is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it. + 

We've been conditioned to fear the word no, but it is a statement of perception far more often than a fact. + 

It seldom means I have considered all the facts and made a rational choice. + 

Instead, no is often a decision frequently temporary to maintain the status quo. + 

Change is scary and no provides a little protection from that scariness. + 

Jim Camp in his excellent book start with no counsels the reader to give their adversary his word for counterpart permission to say no from the outset of a negotiation. + 

He calls it the right to veto. + 

He observes that people will fight to the death to preserve their right to say no. + 

So give them that right and the negotiating environment becomes more constructive and collaborative almost immediately. + 

When I read Camp's book, I realized this was something we'd known as hostage negotiators for years. + 

We'd learned that the quickest way to get a hostage taker out was to take the time to talk them out as opposed to demanding their surrender. + 

Demanding their surrender, telling them to come out, always ended up creating a much longer standoff and occasionally actually contributed to death. + 

It comes down to the deep and universal human need for autonomy. + 

People need to feel in control. + 

When you preserve a person's autonomy by clearly giving them permission to say no to your ideas, the emotions calm, the effectiveness of the decisions go up, and the other party can really look at your proposal. + 

They're allowed to hold it in their hands to turn it around. + 

and it gives you time to elaborate or pivot in order to convince your counterpart that the change you're proposing is more advantageous than the status quo. + 

Great negotiators seek no because they know that's often when the real negotiation begins. + 

Politely saying no to your opponent. + 

We'll go into this in more depth in chapter nine. + 

Calmly hearing no and just letting the other side know that they are welcome to say no has a positive impact on any negotiation. + 

In fact, your invitation for the other side to say no has an amazing power to bring down barriers and allow for beneficial communication. + 

This means you have to train yourself to hear no as something other than rejection and respond accordingly. + 

When someone tells you no, you need to rethink the word in one of its alternative and much more real meanings. + 

I am not yet ready to agree. + 

You are making me feel uncomfortable. + 

I do not understand. + 

I don't think I can afford it. + 

I want something else. + 

I need more information or I want to talk it over with someone else. + 

Then after pausing, ask solution-based questions or simply label their effect. + 

What about this doesn't work for you? What would you need to make it work? It seems like there's something here that bothers you. + 

People have a need to say no. + 

So don't just hope to hear it at some point. + 

Get them to say it early. + 

Persuade in their world. + 

I'd like to present you with a guy named Joe Businessman as he readies himself for a negotiation. + 

You've met him before. + 

He's the prepared type with all his getting to yes strategies written out and memorized, and he's more than ready to unleash them on the guy across the table. + 

Joe pauses to look at his expensive suit in the mirror, fantasizing about the impressive things he'll say and the fancy charts and graphs that'll back up those things and leave his counterpart, his opponent, vanquished and in defeat. + 

He is Russell Crowe in Gladiator. + 

He is the man. + 

Now, allow me to let you in on a secret. + 

None of that preparation will mean a damn thing. + 

His negotiation style is all me me ego ego ego. + 

And when the people on the other side of the table pick up those signals, they're going to decide that it's best to politely, even fertively ignore this Superman by saying yes. + 

Huh? You say, sure, the word they'll say right off is yes. + 

But that word is only a tool to get this blowhard to go away. + 

They'll weasel out later, claiming changing conditions, budget issues, the weather. + 

For now, they just want to be released because Joe isn't convincing them of anything. + 

He's only convincing himself. + 

I'll let you in on a secret. + 

There are actually three kinds of yes: counterfeit, confirmation, and commitment. + 

A counterfeit yes is one in which your counterpart plans on saying no, but either feels yes is an easier escape route or just wants to disingenuously keep the conversation going to obtain more information or some other kind of edge. + 

A confirmation yes is generally innocent, a reflexive response to a black or white question. + 

It's sometimes used to lay a trap, but mostly it's just simple affirmation with no promise of action and a commitment. + 

Yes is the real deal. + 

It's a true agreement that leads to action. + 

A yes at the table that ends with a signature on the contract. + 

The commitment yes is what you want, but the three types sound almost the same. + 

So you have to learn how to recognize which one is being used. + 

Human beings the world over are so used to being pursued for the commitment yes as a condition to find out more that they have become masters at giving the counterfeit yes. + 

That's what the people facing Joe businessmen are doing. + 

Dangling the counterfeit yes so they can hear more. + 

Whether you call it buyin or engagement or something else, good negotiators know that their job isn't to put on a great performance, but to gently guide their counterpart to discover their goal as his own. + 

Let me tell you, I learned that the hard way. + 

2 months after talking with Amy, I started answering phones for helpline, the crisis hotline founded by Norman Vincent Peele. + 

The basic rule was that you couldn't be with anybody on the phone for more than 20 minutes. + 

If you did your job, it wasn't going to take you longer than that to get them to a better place. + 

We had a thick book of organizations we referred them to for help. + 

It was a paramedic approach. + 

Patch them up and send them on their way. + 

But people in crisis only accounted for about 40% of the calls we got. + 

The majority of the calls came from frequent callers. + 

These are highly dysfunctional people, energy vampires whom no one else would listen to anymore. + 

We kept a list of frequent callers. + 

And when you got one, the first thing you had to do was check to see if the person had called that day because they were only allowed one call a day. + 

They knew it, too. + 

A lot of times they'd say, "Yeah, I'm Eddie. + 

I haven't called yet today. + 

Go ahead and check the list. + 

You got to talk to me." Since I was there primarily to learn a skill, I loved the frequent callers. + 

They were a problem and I loved trying to figure them out. + 

I felt I had some talent at it. + 

I felt like a superstar. + 

When it came time for my performance review, they assigned me a shift supervisor named Jim Snyder. + 

Jim was a hotline veteran and a sweetheart. + 

The only problem was he always wanted to joke around. + 

Jim understood that volunteer burnout was the biggest problem at a hotline. + 

So, he dedicated his time to making work fun. + 

I became good friends with Jim. + 

For my review, Jim waited until I got a call and went into the monitoring room where the supervisors could listen to our calls. + 

The call was from one of my frequent clients, a cabbie with a fear of going outside and plenty of time to tell me about it. + 

This energy vampire, his name was Daryl, launched into his shtick about how he was going to lose his house and with it his will to live if he couldn't work. + 

"Seriously, when was the last time someone tried to hurt you on the streets?" I asked. + 

"Well, I mean, it's been a long time," Daryl said. + 

"Like, I can't really remember a date, Chris. + 

Maybe a year, I guess." So, it's safe to say that the outside world hasn't been too hard on you, right? Yes, Daryl said. + 

I suppose so. + 

We went back and forth like this for a while as I made him admit that most of us had little to fear in the world. + 

I was feeling good about my new skills, about listening to Daryl and then carefronting him, which was the slightly goofy name we gave to assertively but caringly responding to frequent callers. + 

It was all flowing and our rapport was great. + 

I even got Daryl to laugh a few times. + 

By the time I was done with him, he couldn't give me one reason not to step outside. + 

"Thank you, Chris," Daryl said just before he hung up. + 

"Thanks for doing such a great job." Before I went to see Jim, I leaned back in my chair and basked in that compliment. + 

"How often do you get that from a man in pain?" I thought. + 

Then I sprung up and stroed toward the monitoring room, so proud I was practically buffing my nails on my shirt and patting my own back. + 

Jim motioned me to the chair in front of him and gave me his biggest smile. + 

I must have returned it with twice the wattage. + 

"Well, Chris," he said, still smiling, that was one of the worst calls I ever heard. + 

I stared at him, gape jawed. + 

Jim, did you hear Daryl congratulate me? I asked. + 

I talked him down, man. + 

I killed it. + 

Jim smiled. + 

I hated that smile right then and nodded. + 

That's one of the signs because they should be congratulating themselves when they get off the line. + 

He said, "They don't need to be congratulating you. + 

That tells me you did too much. + 

If they think you did it, if you were the guy who killed it, how is he going to help himself? I don't want to be harsh, but you were horrible. + 

As I listened to what Jim said, I felt that acid stomach rush you get when you are forced to accept that the guy dumping on you is completely right. + 

Daryl's response had been a kind of yes, but it had been anything but a true commitment yes. + 

He'd made no promise to action. + 

His yes had been designed to make me feel good enough to leave him alone. + 

Daryl may not have known it, but his yes was as counterfeit as they came. + 

You see, that whole call had been about me and my ego and not the caller. + 

But the only way to get these callers to take action was to have them own the conversation, to believe that they were coming to these conclusions, to these necessary next steps, and that the voice at the other end was simply a medium for those realizations. + 

Using all your skills to create rapport, agreement, and connection with a counterpart is useful, but ultimately that connection is useless unless the other person feels that they are equally as responsible, if not solely responsible, for creating the connection and the new ideas they have. + 

I nodded slowly. + 

The fight drained out of me. + 

One of the worst calls, I said to Jim, "That's right." I worked hard at reorienting myself from that point on. + 

I asked so many questions and read so much about it that soon they had me teaching two classes for new volunteers at Helpline. + 

The opening class on active listening and the one on care front. + 

Got it. + 

You say it's not about me. + 

We need to persuade from their perspective, not ours. + 

But how? By starting with their most basic wants. + 

In every negotiation, in every agreement, the result comes from someone else's decision. + 

And sadly, if we believe that we can control or manage others decisions with compromise and logic, we're leaving millions on the table. + 

But while we can't control others decisions, we can influence them by inhabiting their world and seeing and hearing exactly what they want. + 

Though the intensity may differ from person to person, you can be sure that everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges. + 

the need to feel safe and secure and the need to feel in control. + 

If you satisfy those drives, you're in the door. + 

As we saw with my chat with Daryl, you're not going to logically convince them that they're safe, secure, or in control. + 

Primal needs are urgent and illogical. + 

So, arguing them into a corner is just going to push your counterpart to flee with a counterfeit yes. + 

And being nice in the form of feigned sympathy is often equally as unsuccessful. + 

We live in an age that celebrates niceness under various names. + 

We are exhorted to be nice and to respect people's feelings at all times and in every situation. + 

But nice alone in the context of negotiation can backfire. + 

Nice employed as a ruse is disingenuous and manipulative. + 

who hasn't received the short end of the stick in dealings with a nice salesman who took you for a ride. + 

If you rush in with plastic niceness, your bland smile is going to dredge up all that baggage. + 

Instead of getting inside with logic or fain smiles, then we get there by asking for no. + 

It's the word that gives the speaker feelings of safety and control. + 

No starts conversations and creates safe havens to get to the final yes of commitment. + 

An early yes is often just a cheap counterfeit dodge. + 

About 5 months after she'd told me to go away, I stopped by Amy Bono's office and told her that I'd volunteered at Helpline. + 

"You did?" she asked, smiling with surprise. + 

"I tell everybody to do that, and nobody ever does." It turned out that Amy had started her negotiating career by volunteering at the same place. + 

She started naming people who were now mutual friends of ours. + 

We laughed about Jim. + 

In a sudden shift, Amy stopped speaking and stared at me. + 

I shifted in my shoes as she gave me the pause. + 

Then she smiled. + 

You get the next position. + 

At that time, there were five other people aiming for the same slot. + 

people who had psychology degrees, experience, and credentials. + 

But I was on the road to the next hostage negotiation training course at the FBI Academy in Quanico, Virginia, ahead of everybody else. + 

My career as a negotiator had officially begun. + 

No is protection. + 

Think back to the telemarketer at the beginning of this chapter. + 

The obvious reply to his question, "Do you enjoy a nice glass of water?" is yes. + 

But all you want to do is scream no. + 

After a question like that, you just know the rest of the phone call is going to be painful. + 

That in a nutshell distills the inherent contradictions in the values we give yes and no. + 

Whenever we negotiate, there's no doubt we want to finish with a yes. + 

But we mistakenly conflate the positive value of that final yes with a positive value of yes in general. + 

And because we see no as the opposite of yes, we then assume that no is always a bad thing. + 

Nothing could be further from the truth. + 

Saying no gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and control. + 

You use a question that prompts a no answer and your counterpart feels that by turning you down, he has proved that he's in the driver's seat. + 

Good negotiators welcome, even invite a solid no to start as a sign that the other party is engaged and thinking. + 

Gun for a yes straight off the bat, though, and your counterpart gets defensive, wary, and skittish. + 

That's why I tell my students that if you're trying to sell something, don't start with, "Do you have a few minutes to talk?" Instead, ask, "Is now a bad time to talk?" Either you get, "Yes, it is a bad time," followed by a good time or a request to go away, or you get, "No, it's not." and total focus. + 

As an exercise, the next time you get a telemarketing call, write down the questions the seller asks. + 

I promise you'll find that your level of discomfort correlates directly to how quickly he pushes you for yes. + 

My colleague Marty Evilizer was the one who first opened my eyes to why no was better than yes. + 

Marty was the FBI's crisis negotiation coordinator in Pittsburgh at the time. + 

She was a dynamo and a negotiating genius which earned her huge respect both within the bureau and with the local police. + 

But human beings are innately jealous, and her immediate supervisor was no exception to that rule. + 

Her success diminished him, and that made her a threat. + 

His jealousy got the better of him when the Pittsburgh Police Department's hostage negotiation team asked her to sit on the selection board for their new candidates. + 

Picking her and doing so over her boss was an unprecedented move. + 

So, her boss decided to remove her from her position for ignoring her regular duties, he said. + 

But really, it was for being a threat. + 

When Marty sat down with her supervisor for her official dismissal, her options were few. + 

He had every right to do as he pleased. + 

Marty told me that she considered a variety of scenarios. + 

She thought about going right at his jealousy and hashing it out or explaining how the job would reflect well on the bureau. + 

would you like our office to be honored for its expertise? But by the time she sat down with him, she had picked one of the most strongly worded nooriented setup questions I have ever heard. + 

Do you want the FBI to be embarrassed? She said, "No," he answered. + 

"What do you want me to do?" she responded. + 

He leaned back in his chair, one of those 1950s faux leather numbers that squeaked meaningfully when the sitter shifts. + 

He stared at her over his glasses and then nodded ever so slightly. + 

He was in control. + 

"Look, you can keep the position," he said. + 

"Just go back out there and don't let it interfere with your other duties." And a minute later, Marty walked out with her job intact. + 

When I heard Marty do that, I was like, "Bang." By pushing for a no, Marty nudged her supervisor into a zone where he was making the decisions. + 

And then she furthered his feelings of safety and power with a question, inviting him to define her next move. + 

The important thing here is that Marty not only accepted the no, she searched it out and embraced it. + 

At a recent sales conference, I asked the participants for the one word they all dread. + 

The entire group yelled no to them and to almost everyone. + 

No means one thing, end of discussion. + 

But that's not what it means. + 

No is not failure. + 

Used strategically, it's an answer that opens the path forward. + 

Getting to the point where you're no longer horrified by the word no is a liberating moment that every negotiator needs to reach. + 

Because if your biggest fear is no, you can't negotiate. + 

You're the hostage of yes, you're handcuffed. + 

You're done. + 

So, let's undress no. + 

It's a reaffirmation of autonomy. + 

It is not a use or abuse of power. + 

It is not an act of rejection. + 

It is not a manifestation of stubbornness. + 

It is not the end of the negotiation. + 

In fact, no often opens the discussion up. + 

The sooner you say no, the sooner you're willing to see options and opportunities that you were blind to previously. + 

Saying no often spurs people to action because they feel they've protected themselves and now see an opportunity slipping away. + 

Since I've demystified no for myself, I found the ideas, perceptions, and baggage that people have with that two-letter word to be fascinating. + 

To me, it's like watching a movie or a music video from the 1980s for the eenth time. + 

You can identify with the experience while simultaneously being conscious of the fact that the world and you have moved on. + 

Today, I coach my students to learn to see no for what it is rather than harming them or those they negotiate with. + 

No protects and benefits all parties in an exchange. + 

No creates safety, security, and the feeling of control. + 

It's a requirement to implementable success. + 

It's a pause, a nudge, and a chance for the speaker to articulate what they do want. + 

As you can see, no has a lot of skills. + 

No allows the real issues to be brought forth. + 

No protects people from making and lets them correct ineffective decisions. + 

No slows things down so that people can freely embrace their decisions and the agreements they enter into. + 

No helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally comfortable, and in control of their decisions. + 

No moves everyone's efforts forward. + 

One of my grad school students, a political fundraiser named Ben Autenhof, drove home this lesson with a bang. + 

For years, he'd been using a traditional yes pattern fundraising script to raise money for Republican congressional candidates. + 

Fundraiser. + 

Hello. + 

Can I speak with Mr. + 

Smith? Mr. + 

Smith? Yes, this is he. + 

I'm calling from the XYZ committee and I wanted to ask you a few important questions about your views on our economy today. + 

Do you believe that gas prices are currently too high? Mr. + 

Smith. + 

Yes. + 

Gas prices are much too high and hurting my family. + 

Fundraiser. + 

Do you believe that the Democrats are part of the problem when it comes to high gas prices? Yes. + 

President Obama is a bad person. + 

Do you think we need change in November? Yes, I do. + 

Can you give me your credit card number so you can be a part of that change? In theory at least, the yes answers built up a reservoir of positivity that exploded into donations when requested at the end of the script. + 

The problem in reality was that the yes pattern scripts had been giving poor rates of return for years. + 

All the steps were yes, but the final answer was invariably no. + 

Then Ben read Jim Camp's book, Start with No, in my class and began to wonder if no could be a tool to boost donations. + 

Ben knew that giving the potential donors a no hard feelings way to get off the call was going to be a tough sell to his grassroots fundraisers because it goes against everything they had been trained to do. + 

But Ben's a smart guy. + 

So instead of totally swapping scripts, he had a small group of his grassroots guys test market a nooriented script. + 

Fundraiser. + 

Hello. + 

Can I speak with Mr. + 

Smith? Mr. + 

Smith? Yes, this is he. + 

Fundraiser. + 

I'm calling from the XYZ committee and I wanted to ask you a few important questions about your views on our economy today. + 

Do you feel that if things stay the way they are, America's best days are ahead of it? No, things will only get worse. + 

Fundraiser, are you going to sit and watch President Obama take the White House in November without putting up a fight? No. + 

I'm going to do anything I can to make sure that doesn't happen. + 

If you want do something today to make sure that doesn't happen, you can give to XYZ committee, which is working hard to fight for you. + 

See how clearly that swaps yes for no and offers to take a donation if Mr. + 

Smith wants. + 

It puts Mr. + 

Smith in the driver's seat. + 

He's in charge and it works. + 

In a truly remarkable turnaround, the nooriented script got a 23% better rate of return. + 

The only sad part of Ben's tale is that despite the huge improvement in results, he couldn't roll out the script to all his fundraisers. + 

It went against fundraising orthodoxy and longtime fundraisers like the fake comfort of the yes. + 

Genius is often missed the first time around. + 

Right. + 

One negotiating genius who's impossible to miss is Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks. + 

I always quote to my students one of his best lines on negotiation. + 

Every no gets me closer to a yes. + 

But then I remind them that extracting those nos on the road to yes isn't always easy. + 

There is a big difference between making your counterpart feel that they can say no and actually getting them to say it. + 

Sometimes if you're talking to somebody who is just not listening, the only way you can crack their cranium is to antagonize them into no. + 

One great way to do this is to mislabel one of the other party's emotions or desires. + 

You say something that you know is totally wrong, like so it seems that you really are eager to leave your job when they clearly want to stay. + 

That forces them to listen and makes them comfortable correcting you by saying, "No, that's not it. + 

This is it." Another way to force no in a negotiation is to ask the other party what they don't want. + 

Let's talk about what you would say no to. + 

you'd say. + 

And people are comfortable saying no here because it feels like self-p protection. + 

And once you've gotten them to say no, people are much more open to moving forward toward new options and ideas. + 

No, or the lack thereof also serves as a warning, the canary in the coal mine. + 

If despite all your efforts, the other party won't say no, you're dealing with people who are indecisive or confused or who have a hidden agenda. + 

In cases like that, you have to end the negotiation and walk away. + 

Think of it like this. + 

No, no means no go. + 

Email magic. + 

How never to be ignored again. + 

There's nothing more irritating than being ignored. + 

Being turned down is bad, but getting no response at all is the pits. + 

It makes you feel invisible, as if you don't exist, and it's a waste of your time. + 

We've all been through it. + 

You send an email to someone you're trying to do business with and they ignore you. + 

Then you send a polite follow-up and they stonewall you again. + 

So what do you do? You provoke a no with this one-s sentence email. + 

Have you given up on this project? The point is that this one-s sentence email encapsulates the best of no oriented questions and plays on your counterpart's natural human aversion to loss. + 

The no answer the email demands offers the other party the feeling of safety and the illusion of control while encouraging them to define their position and explain it to you. + 

Just as important, it makes the implicit threat that you will walk away on your own terms. + 

To stop that from happening, to cut their losses and prove their power, the other party's natural inclination is to reply immediately and disagree. + 

No, our priorities haven't changed. + 

we've just gotten bogged down. + 

And if you're a parent, you already use this technique instinctively. + 

What do you do when your kids won't leave the house/ park/ mall? You say, "Fine, I'm leaving." And you begin to walk away. + 

I'm going to guess that well over half the time they yell, "No, wait." and run to catch up. + 

No one likes to be abandoned. + 

Now, this may seem like a rude way to address someone in business, but you have to get over that. + 

It's not rude. + 

And though it's direct, it's cloaked with the safety of no. + 

Ignoring you is what's rude. + 

I can tell you that I've used this successfully not just in North America, but with people in two different cultures, Arabic and Chinese, famous for never saying no. + 

Key lessons. + 

Using this chapter's tools in daily life is difficult for many people because they go directly against one of society's biggest social dictims. + 

That is be nice. + 

We've instrumentalized niceness as a way of greasing the social wheels. + 

Yet, it's often a ruse. + 

We're polite and we don't disagree to get through daily existence with the least degree of friction. + 

But by turning niceness into a lubricant, we've leeched it of meaning. + 

A smile and a nod might signify, "Get me out of here." as much as it means, "Nice to meet you." That's death for a good negotiator who gains their power by understanding their counterparts situation and extracting information about their counterparts desires and needs. + 

Extracting that information means getting the other party to feel safe and in control. + 

And while it may sound contradictory, the way to get there is by getting the other party to disagree, to draw their own boundaries, to define their desires as a function of what they do not want. + 

As you try to put the chapter's methods to use, I encourage you to think of them as the anti-nicness ruse. + 

Not in the sense that they are unkind, but in the sense that they are authentic. + 

Triggering no peels away the plastic falsehood of yes and gets you to what's really at stake along the way. + 

Keep in mind these powerful lessons. + 

Break the habit of attempting to get people to say yes. + 

Being pushed for yes makes people defensive. + 

Our love of hearing yes makes us blind to the defensiveness we ourselves feel when someone is pushing us to say it. + 

No is not a failure. + 

We have learned that no is the anti-y and therefore a word to be avoided at all costs. + 

But it really often just means wait or I'm not comfortable with that. + 

Learn how to hear it calmly. + 

It is not the end of the negotiation, but the beginning. + 

Yes is the final goal of a negotiation, but don't aim for it at the start. + 

Asking someone for yes too quickly in a conversation. + 

Do you like to drink water, Mr. + 

Smith? gets his guard up and paints you as an untrustworthy salesman. + 

Saying no makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control. + 

So, trigger it. + 

By saying what they don't want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you. + 

That's why, is now a bad time to talk is always better than, "Do you have a few minutes to talk?" Sometimes the only way to get your counterpart to listen and engage with you is by forcing them into a no. + 

That means intentionally mislabeling one of their emotions or desires or asking a ridiculous question like it seems like you want this project to fail that can only be answered negatively. + 

Negotiate in their world. + 

Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. + 

It's about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. + 

So don't beat them with logic or brute force. + 

Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. + 

It's not about you. + 

If a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise nooriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. + 

Have you given up on this project? Works wonders. +
