[.my2]
制造控制的错觉。

A month after I'd finished working the case 案件；案例 of Jeffrey Schilling.

[.my2]
在我完成杰弗里·席林的案子一个月后。

In May 2001, I got orders 命令；指令 from headquarters 总部；司令部 to head back to 返回；前往 Manila 马尼拉。

[.my2]
2001 年 5 月，我接到了总部的命令，返回马尼拉。

[.my2]
绑架席林的同一伙残酷的激进伊斯兰主义者，名叫阿布沙耶夫（Abu Sai），突袭了 Dos Palma 私人潜水度假村，劫持了 20 名人质，其中包括三名美国人。

马丁和格拉西亚·伯纳姆，一对来自堪萨斯州威奇托的传教士夫妇，以及吉尔莫·索贝罗，一个经营加州防水公司的人。

Dos Palmas was a negotiator's nightmare 噩梦；可怕的经历 from the start.

[.my2]
Dos Palmas 从一开始就是谈判者的噩梦。

The day after the kidnappings 绑架；劫持, the recently elected 最近当选的 Philippine President 菲律宾总统 Gloria Makapagal Royo set up the most confrontational 对抗性的；冲突的, nonconstructive 非建设性的；消极的 dynamic 动态；局势 possible by publicly 公开地；公然地 declaring allout war 全面战争；全力对抗 on the Abu Sai.

[.my2]
绑架发生的第二天，最近当选的菲律宾总统格洛丽亚·马卡帕加尔·罗约公开宣称对阿布沙耶夫全面开战，从而建立了一种最具对抗性、非建设性的动态局势。

Not exactly empathetic discourse 带有同理心的谈话；共情性对话, right? It got a lot worse.

[.my2]
这不完全是带有同理心的谈话，对吧？情况变得更糟了。

The Philippine Army and Marines 海军陆战队 had a turf war 地盘之争；势力范围之争 in the midst of 在…之中；在…期间 the negotiations, pissing off 激怒；惹恼 the kidnappers with several botched 搞砸的；失败的 raids.

[.my2]
菲律宾陆军和海军陆战队在谈判期间发生了地盘之争，几次失败的突袭激怒了绑匪。

Because American hostages were involved 卷入；牵涉, the CIA, the FBI, and US military intelligence 美国军事情报局 were all called in 被召集；被介入, and we too squabbled 争吵；口角 among ourselves.

[.my2]
由于卷入了美国人质，中央情报局、联邦调查局和美国军事情报局都被召集进来，我们自己人之间也争吵不休。

Then the kidnappers raped 强奸；强暴 and killed several hostages.

[.my2]
然后绑匪强奸并杀害了几名人质。

9/11 happened, and the Abu Syaf was linked to 与…有关联；被连接到 al-Qaeda 基地组织。

[.my2]
9/11 发生了，阿布沙耶夫被发现与基地组织有关联。

By the time the crisis 危机；紧急关头 concluded in an orgy 狂欢；（此指）失控的爆发 of gunshots 枪声；枪击 in June 2002, Dos Palmus had officially 官方地；正式地 become the biggest failure in my professional life 职业生涯。

[.my2]
到 2002 年 6 月，这场危机在一阵失控的枪声中结束时，Dos Palmus 已正式成为我职业生涯中最大的失败。

To call it a train wreck 惨败；彻底失败 would be generous 慷慨的；宽容的, if you know what I mean.

[.my2]
如果你明白我的意思，称其为惨败算是宽容的了。

But failures plant the seeds 播下种子；埋下伏笔 of future success, and our failure in the Philippines was no exception 不例外；不例外。

[.my2]
但失败会埋下未来成功的种子，我们在菲律宾的失败也不例外。

If the dose palmus calamity 灾难；不幸事件 showed me anything, it was that we all were still suffering under the notion 观念；想法 that negotiation was a wrestling match 摔跤比赛；角力赛 where the point is to exhaust 耗尽；使精疲力尽 your opponent 对手；敌手 into submission 屈服；投降, hope for the best, and never back down 决不退缩；永不让步。

[.my2]
如果 Dos Palmas 的灾难向我展示了什么，那就是我们都仍然受困于这样一种观念：谈判是一场摔跤比赛，目的是耗尽你的对手使其屈服，抱最好的希望，永不退缩。

As my disappointment with Dose Palmus forced me to reckon with 考虑到；处理 our failed techniques 技巧；技术, I took a deep look into 深入研究；仔细查看 the newest negotiating theories 谈判理论；协商学说, some great and some completely hairbrained 异想天开的；荒谬的, and I had a chance encounter 偶然相遇；意外邂逅 with a case in Pittsburgh that completely changed how I looked at the interpersonal dynamics 人际动态；人际关系活力 of negotiation conversations.

[.my2]
随着我对 Dos Palmas 的失望迫使我处理我们失败的技巧，我深入研究了最新的谈判理论，其中一些很棒，另一些则完全是异想天开，而且我偶然遇到了匹兹堡的一个案例，这个案例彻底改变了我看待谈判对话的人际动态的方式。

From the ashes 灰烬；废墟 of Dose Palmus, then we learned a lesson that would forever change how the FBI negotiated kidnappings.

[.my2]
然后，我们从 Dos Palmas 的废墟中学到了一个将永远改变联邦调查局谈判绑架案方式的教训。

We learned that negotiation was coaxing 哄骗；诱劝, not overcoming 战胜；克服。

[.my2]
我们了解到，谈判是诱劝，而不是战胜。

Co-opting 合作；拉拢, not defeating 击败；打败。

[.my2]
是合作，而不是打败。

Most important, we learned that successful negotiation involved getting your counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution 解决方案；解决办法 himself.

[.my2]
最重要的是，我们了解到成功的谈判涉及让你的对手为你做事，并自己提出你的解决方案。

It involved giving him the illusion 错觉；幻觉 of control while you in fact 事实上；实际上 were the one defining 界定；限定 the conversation.

[.my2]
它涉及给他控制的错觉，而你事实上是界定对话的人。

The tool we developed is something I call the calibrated 经过校准的；精确的 or open-ended question 开放式问题；没有限定答案的问题。

[.my2]
我们开发的工具是我称之为经过校准的或开放式问题的东西。

What it does is remove aggression 攻击性；侵略性 from conversations by acknowledging 承认；认可 the other side openly without resistance 抵抗；阻力。

[.my2]
它的作用是通过公开承认对方而不进行抵抗来消除对话中的攻击性。

In doing so, it lets you introduce 引入；提出 ideas and requests 请求；要求 without sounding pushy 咄咄逼人的；强迫的。

[.my2]
这样做，它允许你引入想法和要求而不显得咄咄逼人。

It allows you to nudge 轻推；推动。

[.my2]
它允许你轻推。

I'll explain it in depth 深入地；透彻地 later on, but for now, let me say that it's really as simple as removing the hostility 敌意；不友好 from the statement you can't leave and turning it into a question.

[.my2]
我稍后会深入地解释它，但就目前而言，让我说它真的就像消除“你不能离开”这句话中的敌意，然后将其变成一个问题一样简单。

What do you hope to achieve by going? Don't try to negotiate in a firefight 交火；枪战。

[.my2]
“你希望通过离开达到什么目的？”不要试图在交火中谈判。

The moment I arrived in Manila on the Burnham Sabaro case, I was sent down to the Mindanao region 棉兰老岛地区 where the Philippine military was lobbing 投掷；扔 bullets 子弹；弹药 and rockets 火箭；火箭弹 into a hospital complex 医院综合大楼 where the Abu Sai off and the hostages were holed up 躲藏；潜伏。

[.my2]
我到达马尼拉处理伯纳姆-索贝罗案件的那一刻，我被派往棉兰老岛地区，菲律宾军队正在向阿布沙耶夫和人质躲藏的医院综合大楼投掷子弹和火箭弹。

This was no place for a negotiator because it's impossible 不可能的；办不到的 to have a dialogue 对话；交流 in the middle of 在…中间；在…过程中 a firefight.

[.my2]
这不是一个谈判者的容身之所，因为在交火的中间不可能进行对话。

Then things got worse.

[.my2]
然后情况变得更糟了。

When I woke up the next morning, I learned that during the night, the kidnappers had taken their hostages and escaped 逃脱；逃跑。

[.my2]
第二天早上我醒来时，我得知在夜里，绑匪带着他们的人质逃跑了。

The escape was the first sign 迹象；信号 that this operation 行动；操作 was going to be a rolling train wreck 不断发生的惨败；持续的灾难 and that the Philippine military was less than a trustworthy 可信赖的；可靠的 partner.

[.my2]
这次逃跑是第一个迹象，表明这次行动将是一场不断发生的惨败，而且菲律宾军队不太是一个可信赖的伙伴。

During debriefings 任务汇报；情况汇报 following the episode 事件；插曲, it was revealed that during a ceasefire 停火；休战, a military guy had collected 收集；取走 a suitcase 行李箱；手提箱 from the thugs 暴徒；恶棍 in the hospital.

[.my2]
在事件发生后的任务汇报中，据透露，在停火期间，一名军人从医院里的暴徒那里取走了一个行李箱。

And not long after that, all the soldiers on the rear perimeter 后方周边；后方边界 of the hospital had been called away 叫走；调离 for a meeting.

[.my2]
不久之后，医院后方边界的所有士兵都被调离去开会了。

Coincidentally 巧合地；碰巧地 or not, the bad guys chose that moment to slip away 溜走；悄悄离开。

[.my2]
巧合地或不巧合地，那些坏人选择了那个时刻溜走。

[.my2]
两周后，在菲律宾独立日，事情彻底爆发了，当时阿布·萨巴亚宣布，除非政府在中午前撤销对白人的搜捕，否则他将斩首其中一个。

We knew this meant one of the Americans and anticipated 预期；预料 it would be Guiermo Sobero.

[.my2]
我们知道这指的是其中一名美国人，并预期会是吉尔莫·索贝罗。

We didn't have any direct contact 直接接触；直接联系 with the kidnappers at the time because our partners in the Philippine military had assigned 分配；指派 us an intermediary 中间人；调解人 who always forgot to make sure we were present 出席；在场 for his phone calls with the kidnappers and similarly 类似地；同样地 forgot to tape them 录音；录像。

[.my2]
当时我们与绑匪没有任何直接联系，因为我们在菲律宾军队中的伙伴给我们指派了一个中间人，他总是忘记确保我们出席他与绑匪的电话通话，类似地也忘记给它们录音。

All we could do was send text messages offering to schedule 安排；计划 a time to speak.

[.my2]
我们所能做的就是发送短信，提议安排一个通话时间。

What ended up happening 最终发生；结果是 was that just before the noon deadline 截止日期；最后期限, Sabaya and a member of the Philippine presidential cabinet 总统内阁；内阁成员 had a conversation on a radio talk show 广播脱口秀 and the government conceded 承认；让步 to Sabaya's demand 要求；请求 to name a Malaysian senator 马来西亚参议员 as a negotiator 谈判者；协商人。

[.my2]
最终发生的是，就在中午截止日期之前，萨巴亚和菲律宾总统内阁的一名成员在广播脱口秀上进行了对话，政府让步于萨巴亚的要求，任命一名马来西亚参议员作为谈判者。

In exchange 作为交换；作为回报, Sabaya agreed to not kill a hostage.

[.my2]
作为交换，萨巴亚同意不杀害人质。

But it was too late to fix this atmosphere 气氛；氛围 of confrontation 对抗；冲突, distrust 不信任；怀疑, and lies 谎言；虚假。

[.my2]
但要修复这种对抗、不信任和谎言的气氛已经太晚了。

That afternoon, the hostages heard Sabaya on the phone yelling 喊叫；大喊, "But that was part of the agreement 协议；协定。

[.my2]
那天下午，人质们听到萨巴亚在电话里喊叫：“但那是协议的一部分。

That was a part of the agreement." Not long after, the Abu Sai beheaded Golmo Sobero, and for good measure 额外地；为了确保, the group took 15 more hostages.

[.my2]
那是协议的一部分。”不久之后，阿布沙耶夫斩首了吉尔莫·索贝罗，为了确保，该组织又劫持了 15 名人质。

With none of the important moving parts 关键部分；活动部件 anywhere near under our control, and the United States largely 很大程度上；主要地 uninterested 不感兴趣的；冷漠的 in spite of 尽管；虽然 Sober's murder, I headed back to Washington, DC.

[.my2]
由于没有任何重要的关键部分在我们的控制之下，而且尽管索贝罗被谋杀，美国仍然在很大程度上不感兴趣，我返回了华盛顿特区。

It seemed like there was little we could do.

[.my2]
看来我们无能为力。

Then 9/11 changed everything.

[.my2]
然后 9/11 改变了一切。

Once a minor 较小的；不重要的 terrorist outfit 恐怖组织；装备, the Abu Sai was suddenly linked to al-Qaeda.

[.my2]
阿布沙耶夫这个曾经不重要的恐怖组织，突然被与基地组织联系起来。

And then a Philippine TV reporter named Arlland de la Cruz got into the Abu Sai camp and videotaped 用录像录制；录影 Sabaya as he taunted 嘲弄；奚落 the American missionaries 传教士；教士 Martin and Gracia Burnham, who were so emaciated 瘦弱的；憔悴的 they looked like concentration camp survivors 集中营幸存者。

[.my2]
然后，一位名叫阿兰德·德拉·克鲁兹的菲律宾电视记者进入了阿布沙耶夫的营地，并录制了萨巴亚嘲弄美国传教士马丁和格拉西亚·伯纳姆的视频，他们是如此瘦弱憔悴，看起来像集中营幸存者。

The video hit the US news media 媒体；新闻界 like thunder 像雷声一样；引起轰动。

[.my2]
这段视频像雷声一样击中了美国新闻媒体。

Suddenly, the case became a major US government priority 优先事项；首要任务。

The FBI sent me back in.

联邦调查局再次派我进去。

Now I was sent in to make sure a deal got made.

[.my2]
现在我被派进去确保达成交易。

It was all very highprofile 备受关注的；高调的, too.

[.my2]
这也备受关注。

[.my2]
当穆勒局长出现在马尼拉的美国大使馆，我被介绍给他时，他脸上掠过一丝认出的表情。

[.my2]
那是一个非常令人兴奋的时刻。

But all the support in the world won't work if your counterpart's team is dysfunctional 机能失调的；功能障碍的。

[.my2]
但是如果你的对手的团队机能失调，世界上所有的支持都将无效。

If your negotiation efforts 努力；尝试 don't reach past 超过；穿过 your counterpart and into the team behind him, then you've got a hopebased deal 基于希望的交易；寄希望于的交易, and hope is not a strategy 策略；战略。

[.my2]
如果你的谈判努力没有穿透你的对手，深入到他背后的团队，那么你得到的就是一个基于希望的交易，而希望不是策略。

One of the things I failed to fully appreciate 充分理解；完全领会 then was that the kidnappers had changed negotiators themselves.

[.my2]
当时我未能充分理解的一件事是，绑匪自己更换了谈判者。

Sabaya had been replaced 被取代；被替换。

[.my2]
萨巴亚被取代了。

My boss, Gary Nosner, had in a previous kidnapping pointed out 指出；指明 to me that a change in negotiators by the other side almost always signaled 预示着；标志着 that they meant to take a harder line 更强硬的立场；更坚定的态度。

[.my2]
我的老板加里·诺斯纳在一次以前的绑架案中曾向我指出，对方更换谈判者几乎总是预示着他们打算采取更强硬的立场。

What I didn't realize at the time was this meant Sabaya was going to play a role as a deal breakaker 交易破坏者；搅局者 if he wasn't accounted for 被考虑在内；被重视。

[.my2]
当时我没有意识到的是，这意味着如果萨巴亚没有被考虑在内，他将扮演一个交易破坏者的角色。

Our new tac 策略；战术 was to buy the Burnhams back.

[.my2]
我们新的策略是把伯纳姆夫妇买回来。

Although the United States officially doesn't pay ransoms 赎金；赎金钱, a donor 捐助者；捐赠人 had been found who would provide 提供；供给 $300,000.

尽管美国官方不支付赎金，但已经找到了一个愿意提供 30 万美元的捐助者。

新的阿布沙耶夫谈判者同意释放。

The ransom drop 赎金交付；赎金投递 was a disaster 灾难；彻底失败。

[.my2]
后来我们听说另一个政府机构向他们通风报信了。

That other government agency OGA had not told us about their location 地点；位置 because because why? That's something I will never understand.

[.my2]
格拉西亚和马丁正在他们的吊床里小睡，这时子弹开始倾泻而下。

They both fell out of their hammocks and started to roll down the hill 向下滚动；滚落 towards safety.

[.my2]
他们都从吊床里摔了出来，开始滚落下山坡，奔向安全。

But as a sheet of bullets 一片子弹；一阵子弹 from their rescuers 救援人员；救星 fell on them, Gracia felt a searing burn 灼烧感；炙热感 flare through 闪过；突然爆发 her right thigh 大腿；股。

[.my2]
但是当他们的救援人员射出的一片子弹落在他们身上时，格拉西亚感到一股灼烧感闪过她的右大腿。

[.my2]
几天后，我独自坐在家中的黑暗中，情绪低落而筋疲力尽，我知道有些事情必须改变。

有人无意中听到马丁·B在给某人打电话。

I wondered what in God's name 到底；究竟 our hostage 人质 was doing.

[.my2]
我纳闷我们的人质到底在做什么。

Talking on the phone without us knowing and with whom was he talking.

There's only one reason a hostage ever gets on a phone.

[.my2]

他想亲自买下人质，以便使菲律宾总统阿罗约难堪。

But it wasn't so much that this guy was going behind our backs 背着我们；暗中进行 that bothered 困扰；使烦恼 me.

[.my2]
但这并不是这个人背着我们做事而困扰我的地方。

As is pretty clear already, there were a whole lot of underhanded 偷偷摸摸的；不光明的 things going on.

[.my2]
正如已经非常清楚的那样，当时发生着很多偷偷摸摸的事情。

What really ate at me 使烦恼；使痛苦 was that this schmuck 笨蛋；蠢货, who wasn't an FBI trained hostage negotiator 经过联邦调查局训练的人质谈判者, had pulled off 成功做到；办成 something that I hadn't been able to.

[.my2]
真正使我痛苦的是，这个笨蛋，他不是经过联邦调查局训练的人质谈判者，却成功做到了我未能做到的事情。

He'd gotten to speak to Martin Burnham on the phone for free 免费地；不付出代价地。

[.my2]
他免费地在电话中与马丁·伯纳姆通话了。

That's when I realized that this crooked pole success where we had failed was a kind of metaphor 比喻；象征 for everything that was wrong with our one-dimensional mindset 一维思维模式；单一思维定势。

[.my2]
就在那时我意识到，这个狡诈的政客成功而我们失败了，这对于我们一维思维模式中所有错误来说，是一种比喻。

Beyond our problems with the Philippine military, the big reason we had no effective influence 有效影响；实际影响 with the kidnappers and hostages was that we had this very tit fortat mentality 以牙还牙的心态；针锋相对的思维。

[.my2]
除了我们与菲律宾军队的问题之外，我们对绑匪和人质没有有效影响的主要原因是我们有这种以牙还牙的心态。

Under that mentality, if we called up the bad guys, we were asking for something.

[.my2]
在这种心态下，如果我们给坏人打电话，我们就是在要求某样东西。

And if they gave it to us, we had to give them something back.

[.my2]
如果他们给了我们，我们就必须回报他们一些东西。

And so, because we were positive that the Burnhams were alive, we'd never bothered to call and ask for proof of life.

[.my2]
因此，因为我们确信伯纳姆夫妇还活着，我们从未费心打电话索要存活证明。

We were afraid to go into debt 欠债；负债。

[.my2]
我们害怕欠债。

If we made an ask 提出要求；提出请求 and they granted 允许；同意 it, we'd owe 亏欠；欠情。

[.my2]
如果我们提出要求，而他们允许了，我们就会欠情。

Not making good on a debt 履行债务；还清欠款 risk the accusation 指控；谴责 of bad faith negotiation 恶意谈判；不真诚的谈判。

[.my2]
不履行债务会冒恶意谈判的指控的风险。

And bad faith in kidnappings gets people killed.

[.my2]
而绑架案中的恶意会导致人被杀害。

And of course, we didn't ask the kidnappers to talk directly to the hostage because we knew they'd say no and we were afraid of being embarrassed 尴尬；难堪。

[.my2]
当然，我们没有要求绑匪直接与人质通话，因为我们知道他们会拒绝，我们害怕难堪。

That fear was a major flaw 重大缺陷；主要错误 in our negotiating mindset 心态；思维模式。

[.my2]
这种恐惧是我们谈判心态中的一个重大缺陷。

There is some information that you can only get through direct extended 延长的；长时间的 interactions 互动；交流 with your counterpart.

[.my2]
有些信息你只能通过与你的对手直接、长时间的互动才能获得。

We also needed new ways to get things without asking for them.

[.my2]
我们还需要新的方式来获得东西而不提出要求。

We needed to finesse 巧妙地处理；娴熟地应对 making an ask with something more sophisticated 复杂的；精密的 than closedended questions 封闭式问题；有明确答案的问题 with their yes no dynamic 动态；机制。

[.my2]
我们需要用比封闭式问题及其“是/否”机制更巧妙、精密的方式来娴熟地应对提出要求。

That's when I realized that what we had been doing wasn't communication.

[.my2]
就在那时我意识到，我们一直在做的不是沟通。

It was verbal flexing 语言上的炫耀；口头上的逞强。

[.my2]
那是口头上的逞强。

We wanted them to see things our way and they wanted us to see it their way.

[.my2]
我们希望他们以我们的方式看待事物，而他们希望我们以他们的方式看待事物。

If you let this dynamic loose in the real world, negotiation breaks down 瓦解；失败 and tensions 紧张关系；对立情绪 flare 爆发；加剧。

[.my2]
如果你在现实世界中放任这种动态局势，谈判就会瓦解，紧张关系就会加剧。

That whole ethos 精神特质；社会思潮 permeated 渗透；弥漫 everything the FBI was doing.

[.my2]
那种精神特质渗透到联邦调查局所做的一切。

Everything was a showdown 对决；摊牌 and it didn't work.

[.my2]
一切都是一场对决，但它没有奏效。

Our approach 方法；途径 to proof of life questions embodied 体现；具体化 all these problems.

[.my2]
我们处理存活证明问题的方法体现了所有这些问题。

At the time, we proved that our hostages were alive by devising 设计；想出 questions that asked for a piece of information only the hostage could know.

[.my2]
当时，我们通过设计只有人质才知道的一条信息的问题，来证明我们的人质还活着。

Computer security style questions like, "What's the name of Martin's first dog?" or what's Martin's dad's middle name? This particular type of question had many failings 缺点；失败之处, however.

[.my2]
电脑安全式的问题，比如：“马丁的第一只狗叫什么名字？”或者“马丁父亲的中间名叫什么？”然而，这种特定类型的问题有很多缺点。

For one thing, it had sort of become a signature 标志；特征 of law enforcement 执法部门；警务 in the kidnapping world.

[.my2]
首先，它在绑架界已经有点成为执法部门的标志。

When a family starts asking a question of that type, it's a near certainty 几乎肯定；近乎确信 that the cops are coaching 教导；指导 them.

[.my2]
当一个家庭开始问那种类型的问题时，几乎可以肯定是警察在指导他们。

And that makes kidnappers very nervous 紧张的；不安的。

[.my2]
那让绑匪非常紧张。

Even beyond the nerves, you had the problem that answering questions like those required little if any 即使有也很少；几乎没有 effort.

[.my2]
即使超越紧张，你还有一个问题，那就是回答像那样的问题几乎不需要任何努力。

The bad guys go and get the fact and give it to you right away 立刻；马上 because it's so easy.

[.my2]
坏人去取得事实并立刻给你，因为它太容易了。

Bang.

[.my2]
砰。

Bang.

[.my2]
砰。

It happens so fast that you didn't gain any tactical advantage 战术优势；策略优势, any usable 可用的；实用的 information.

[.my2]
它发生得太快了，你没有获得任何战术优势，任何可用的信息。

Any effort on their part toward a goal that serves you 服务于你；对你有益。

[.my2]
他们任何朝向服务于你的目标的努力都没有。

And all negotiation done well should be an information gathering process 信息收集过程；情报收集过程 that vests your counterpart in 使你的对手有厉害关系；让你的对手参与 an outcome 结果；结局 that serves you.

[.my2]
而且，所有做得好的谈判都应该是一个信息收集过程，它使你的对手与一个服务于你的结果有厉害关系。

Worst of all, the bad guys know that they have just given you something, a proof of life, which triggers 触发；引起 this whole human reciprocity gene 互惠基因；互惠本能。

[.my2]
最糟糕的是，坏人知道他们刚刚给了你一些东西，一个存活证明，这触发了整个人类的互惠本能。

Whether we like to recognize 承认；认识到 it or not, a universal rule 普遍规则；普遍规律 of human nature 人性；人类本性 across all cultures 文化；文明 is that when somebody gives you something, they expect something in return 作为回报；作为交换 and they won't give anything else until you pay them back 偿还；回报。

[.my2]
不管我们愿不愿承认，跨越所有文化的人性普遍规则是，当有人给你东西时，他们期望作为回报得到一些东西，在你回报他们之前，他们不会再给任何其他东西。

Now, we didn't want to trigger this whole reciprocity thing because we didn't want to give anything.

[.my2]
现在，我们不想触发这种互惠的事情，因为我们不想给予任何东西。

So what happened? All of our conversations became these paralyzed 瘫痪的；僵住的 confrontations 对抗；冲突 between two parties 双方；党派 who wanted to extract 提取；索取 something from each other but didn't want to give.

[.my2]
那么发生了什么？我们所有的对话都变成了僵住的双方之间的对抗，他们都想从对方那里索取东西，但又不想给予。

We didn't communicate out of pride 自尊；骄傲 and fear.

[.my2]
我们因为自尊和恐惧而没有沟通。

That's why we failed.

[.my2]
这就是我们失败的原因。

While numb skulls 麻木的头脑；愚蠢的人 like this crooked Philippine politician just stumbled in 偶然闯入；偶然撞见 and got what we so desperately 绝望地；极度地 needed, that is communication without reciprocity 没有互惠的沟通；无偿的沟通。

[.my2]
然而，像这个狡诈的菲律宾政客这样的愚蠢的人只是偶然闯入，就得到了我们极度需要的东西，即没有互惠的沟通。

I sat back and wondered to myself, how the hell 到底；究竟 do we do that? Suspend unbelief 停止不相信；消除不信任。

[.my2]
我坐下来自问，我们究竟该怎么做？消除不信任。

While I was racking my brains 绞尽脑汁；费尽心思 over how this sleazy 卑劣的；肮脏的 politician managed to get Martin Burnham on the phone while we never could, FBI Pittsburgh had a kidnapping case.

[.my2]
正当我绞尽脑汁思考这个卑劣的政客如何能让马丁·伯纳姆接电话，而我们却永远不能时，联邦调查局匹兹堡分局接手了一个绑架案。

My partner Chuck brought me the tapes 录音带；录像带 from the case because he thought it was funny.

[.my2]
我的搭档查克给我带来了这个案件的录音带，因为他觉得这很有趣。

You see, one Pittsburgh drug dealer 毒贩；毒品贩子 had kidnapped the girlfriend of another Pittsburgh drug dealer.

[.my2]
你看，一个匹兹堡的毒贩绑架了另一个匹兹堡毒贩的女朋友。

And for whatever reason 不论什么原因；出于某种原因, the victim drug dealer came to the FBI for help.

[.my2]
出于某种原因，受害的毒贩来向联邦调查局求助。

Coming to the FBI seemed kind of contrary to 违反；与…相反 his best interests, being a drug dealer and all, but he did it because no matter who you are, when you need help, you go to the FBI, right? On the tapes, our hostage negotiators are riding around with this drug dealer while he's negotiating with the other drug dealer.

[.my2]
作为一个毒贩，来找联邦调查局似乎有点违反他的最佳利益，但他还是这么做了，因为无论你是谁，当你需要帮助时，你都会去找联邦调查局，对吧？在录音带中，我们的人质谈判者正和这个毒贩一起四处奔波，而他正在和另一个毒贩谈判。

Normally, we would have had the guy ask a bulletproof 无懈可击的；绝对可靠的 proof of life question like, "What was the name of the girlfriend's teddy bear 泰迪熊；毛绒玩具 when she was little, but in this situation, this drug dealer hadn't yet been coached on asking a correct question.

[.my2]
通常，我们会让这个人问一个无懈可击的存活证明问题，比如：“她小时候，女朋友的泰迪熊叫什么名字？”但在这种情况下，这个毒贩还没有被指导如何问一个正确的问题。

So, in the middle of the conversation with the kidnapper, he just blurts 突然说出；脱口而出, "Hey, dog, how do I know she's all right?" And the funniest thing happened.

[.my2]
所以，在与绑匪对话的过程中，他只是脱口而出：“嘿，伙计，我怎么知道她没事？”然后发生了最有趣的事情。

The kidnapper actually went silent for 10 seconds.

[.my2]
绑匪真的沉默了 10 秒。

He was completely taken aback 吃惊；吓了一跳。

[.my2]
他完全吃了一惊。

Then he said in a much less confrontational 对抗性的；冲突的 tone of voice 语气；声调, "Well, I'll put her on the phone 让她听电话；让她接电话。

[.my2]
然后他以一种不那么具对抗性的语气说：“好吧，我让她接电话。”

I was floored 震惊；被难住 because this unsophisticated 不老练的；单纯的 drug dealer just pulled off a phenomenal 惊人的；非凡的 victory 胜利；成功 in the negotiation." To get the kidnapper to volunteer 自愿；主动 to put the victim on the phone is massively huge 极大的；巨大的。

[.my2]
我震惊了，因为这个不老练的毒贩刚刚在谈判中取得了非凡的成功。让绑匪自愿让受害者接电话是极其巨大的。

That's when I had my holy moment 神圣时刻；顿悟 and realized that this is the technique I'd been waiting for.

[.my2]
就在那时我有了顿悟，并意识到这正是我一直在等待的技巧。

Instead of asking some closedended question 封闭式问题；有明确答案的问题 with a single correct answer, he'd asked an open-ended 开放式问题；没有限定答案的问题 yet calibrated 经过校准的；精确的 one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve the problem 解决问题；找到办法。

[.my2]
他没有问一个有单一正确答案的封闭式问题，而是问了一个开放式但精确的问题，迫使对方停顿并真正思考如何解决问题。

I thought to myself, "This is perfect.

[.my2]
我心想：“这太完美了。

It's a natural and normal question, not a request for a fact.

[.my2]
这是一个自然、正常的问题，而不是对一个事实的请求。

It's a how question." And how engages 吸引；参与 because how asks for help.

[.my2]
这是一个如何的问题。”而“如何”会吸引人，因为“如何”是在寻求帮助。

Best of all, he doesn't owe the kidnapper a damn thing 一点也不；完全不。

[.my2]
最棒的是，他完全不欠绑匪任何东西。

The guy volunteers to put the girlfriend on the phone.

[.my2]
那个人自愿让他的女朋友接电话。

He thinks it's his idea.

[.my2]
他认为这是他的主意。

The guy who just offered to put the girlfriend on the line thinks he's in control.

[.my2]
那个刚刚主动提出让女朋友接电话的人认为自己在控制局面。

And the secret to gaining the upper hand 占上风；取得优势 in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control.

[.my2]
在谈判中占上风的秘诀是给予对方控制的错觉。

The genius 天才；精妙之处 of this technique is really well explained by something that the psychologist 心理学家 Kevin Dutton says in his book, Split-second Persuasion 一秒钟说服；瞬间说服。

[.my2]
这项技巧的精妙之处，被心理学家凯文·达顿在他的书《一秒钟说服》中所说的一些话很好地解释了。

He talks about what he calls unbelief 不相信；不信任, which is active resistance 积极抵抗；主动抵制 to what the other side is saying, complete rejection 完全拒绝；彻底反对。

[.my2]
他谈到了他称之为“不相信”的东西，这是对对方所说的话的积极抵抗，是完全拒绝。

That's where the two parties in a negotiation usually start.

[.my2]
这就是谈判双方通常开始的地方。

If you don't ever get off that dynamic, you end up having showdowns as each side tries to impose 强加；硬性推行 its point of view 观点；看法。

[.my2]
如果你没有摆脱那种动态局势，最终你就会进行对决，因为每一方都试图强行推行自己的观点。

You get two hard skulls 坚硬的头颅；顽固的脑袋 banging against 撞击；碰撞 each other like in Dose Palmus.

[.my2]
你得到的是两个坚硬的头颅互相碰撞，就像在 Dos Palmus 案中一样。

But if you can get the other side to drop their unbelief, you can slowly work them to your point of view on the back of 依靠；利用 their energy, just like the drug dealer's question got the kidnapper to volunteer to do what the drug dealer wanted.

[.my2]
但如果你能让对方消除他们的不信任，你就可以依靠他们的能量，慢慢地引导他们接受你的观点，就像那个毒贩的问题让绑匪自愿去做毒贩想做的事情一样。

You don't directly persuade 说服；劝说 them to see your ideas.

[.my2]
你不是直接说服他们接受你的想法。

Instead, you ride them to your ideas.

[.my2]
相反，你利用他们来达到你的想法。

As the saying goes 俗话说；正如所说, the best way to ride a horse 骑马；驾驭 is in the direction in which it is going.

[.my2]
俗话说，驾驭一匹马的最好方式是顺着它前进的方向。

Our job as persuaders 说服者；劝说者 is easier than we think.

[.my2]
作为说服者，我们的工作比我们想象的要容易。

It's not to get others believing what we say.

[.my2]
它不是让别人相信我们所说的话。

It's just to stop them unbelieving.

[.my2]
它只是阻止他们不相信。

Once we achieve that, the game's half won 胜券在握；成功了一半。

[.my2]
一旦我们达到这一点，这场博弈就胜券在握了。

Unbelief is the friction 摩擦；阻力 that keeps persuasion in check 得到控制；受到约束。

[.my2]
不相信是阻止说服受到约束的阻力。

Dutton says, "Without it, there'd be no limits." Giving your counterpart 对手；对应方 the illusion 错觉；幻觉 of control 控制；支配 by asking calibrated questions 经过校准的问题；精确化问题, by asking for help, is one of the most powerful tools for suspending unbelief 消除不信任；停止不相信。

[.my2]
达顿说：“没有它，就没有限制。”通过询问经过校准的问题，通过寻求帮助，给予你的对手控制的错觉，是消除不信任最有力的工具之一。

Not long ago, I read this great article in the New York Times by a medical student 医学生；医学系学生 who was faced with 面对；遇到 a patient 病人；患者 who had ripped out 扯出；拔出 his IV 静脉注射；点滴, packed his bags 打包；整理行李, and was making a move 采取行动；准备离开 to leave because his biopsy results 活组织检查结果 were days late and he was tired of 厌倦；对…感到厌烦 waiting.

[.my2]
不久前，我读到《纽约时报》上一篇很棒的文章，作者是一位医学生，他面对一位病人，这个病人扯出了他的静脉注射，整理了行李，正准备离开，因为他的活组织检查结果迟了好几天，他厌倦了等待。

Just then, a senior physician 资深医生；高级医师 arrived.

[.my2]
就在这时，一位资深医生来了。

After calmly offering the patient a glass of water and asking if they could chat 闲聊；交谈 for a minute, he said he understood why the patient was pissed off 生气；发火 and promised to call the lab 实验室；化验室 to see why the results were delayed 延迟；推迟。

[.my2]
在平静地给病人提供一杯水并询问他们是否可以闲聊一分钟后，他说他理解病人为什么生气，并承诺会打电话给实验室，看看结果为什么延迟了。

But what he did next is what really suspended the patients unbelief.

[.my2]
但他接下来所做的，才是真正消除了病人的不信任。

He asked a calibrated question, what he felt was so important about leaving.

[.my2]
他问了一个经过校准的问题，问他觉得离开为什么如此重要。

And then when the patient said he had errands 差事；跑腿 to handle 处理；应对, the doctor offered to connect the patient with services that could help him get them done.

[.my2]
然后当病人说他有差事要处理时，医生主动提出将病人与可以帮助他完成这些差事的服务联系起来。

And boom, the patient volunteered 自愿；主动 to stay.

[.my2]
然后，病人自愿留下来了。

What's so powerful 强大的；有力的 about the senior doctor's technique 技巧；方法 is that he took what was a showdown 对决；摊牌, I'm going to leave versus 对比；对抗 you can't leave, and asked questions that led the patient to solve his own problem in the way the doctor wanted.

[.my2]
这位资深医生的技巧如此强大之处在于，他将一场对决（我要离开对抗你不能离开）变成了提问，从而引导病人以医生希望的方式解决自己的问题。

It was still a kind of showdown, of course, but the doctor took the confrontation 对抗；冲突 and bravado 虚张声势；逞能 out of it by giving the patient the illusion of control.

[.my2]
当然，这仍然是一种对决，但医生通过给病人控制的错觉，消除了其中的对抗和虚张声势。

As an old Washington Post editor 编辑；主编 named Robert Estbrook once said, "He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable 不令人不快的；友善的 has discovered 发现；找到 the most valuable secret 宝贵的秘密；最有价值的秘诀 of negotiation." This same technique for suspending unbelief that you use with kidnappers and escaping patients works for anything, even negotiating prices.

[.my2]
正如一位名叫罗伯特·埃斯特布鲁克的老《华盛顿邮报》编辑曾经说过的：“学会不同意而不令人不快的人，已经发现了谈判最宝贵的秘密。”你用于消除绑匪和逃跑病人不信任的这种相同的技巧适用于任何事情，甚至谈判价格。

When you go into a store 商店；店铺, instead of telling the sales clerk 售货员；店员 what you need, you can describe 描述；形容 what you're looking for and ask for suggestions 建议；提议。

[.my2]
当你走进一家商店时，与其告诉售货员你需要什么，不如描述你在寻找什么，然后寻求建议。

Then, once you've picked out 挑出；选出 what you want, instead of hitting them with a hard offer 强硬的出价；坚定的提议, you can just say, "The price is a bit more than you budgeted 预算；规划费用。" And ask for help with one of the greatest of all time calibrated questions.

[.my2]
然后，一旦你挑出了你想要的东西，与其向他们提出强硬的出价，不如直接说：“这个价格比你预算的要多一点。”然后用一个有史以来最伟大的经过校准的问题来寻求帮助。

How am I supposed to do that? The critical part 关键部分；重要环节 of this approach 方法；途径 is that you really are asking for help and your delivery 表达方式；措辞 must convey 传达；表达 that.

[.my2]
“我该怎么做？”这种方法的关键部分在于你确实在寻求帮助，而且你的表达方式必须传达这一点。

With this negotiating scheme 方案；计划, instead of bullying 霸凌；胁迫 the clerk, you're asking for their advice and giving them the illusion of control.

[.my2]
有了这个谈判方案，你与其胁迫店员，不如征求他们的建议，并给予他们控制的错觉。

Asking for help in this manner 方式；方法 after you've already been engaged in 参与；从事 a dialogue 对话；交流 is an incredibly 令人难以置信地；极其地 powerful negotiating technique 谈判技巧；协商技术 for transforming 转变；改变 encounters 遭遇；会面 from confrontational showdowns 对抗性摊牌；冲突性对决 into joint problem-solving sessions 共同解决问题的会议；联合解决问题的环节。

[.my2]
在你已经参与了对话之后，以这种方式寻求帮助是一种极其强大的谈判技巧，可以将遭遇从对抗性摊牌转变为共同解决问题的环节。

And calibrated questions are the best tool.

[.my2]
而经过校准的问题是最好的工具。

Calibrate your questions.

[.my2]
校准你的问题。

A few years ago, I was consulting with 咨询；提供建议 a client 客户；委托人 who had a small firm 小型公司；小企业 that did public relations 公共关系；公关 for a large corporation 大型公司；大企业。

[.my2]
几年前，我正在咨询一位客户，她有一家为大型公司做公共关系的小型公司。

The folks at the big company were not paying their bills 账单；费用。

[.my2]
那家大企业的人没有支付她的账单。

And as time went on 随着时间推移；渐渐地, they owed 欠；负债 my client more and more money.

[.my2]
随着时间推移，他们欠我的客户越来越多的钱。

They kept her on the hook 吊着胃口；拖着不放 by promising lots of repeat business 回头客生意；重复业务, implying 暗示；意味 that she would get a pile of revenue 堆积如山的收入；大量营收 if she just kept working.

[.my2]
他们通过承诺大量的回头客生意来拖着她不放，暗示如果她继续工作，就会获得大量营收。

She felt trapped 被困住的；陷入困境的。

[.my2]
她感到被困住了。

My advice 建议；忠告 for her was simple.

[.my2]
我对她的建议很简单。

I told her to engage them in a conversation where she summarized 总结；概括 the situation and then asked, "How am I supposed to do that?" She shook her head 摇了摇头；表示否定。

[.my2]
我告诉她与他们进行一次对话，在对话中她总结了情况，然后问：“我该怎么做？”她摇了摇头。

"No way.

[.my2]
“不可能。

The idea of having to ask this question just terrified 惊吓；使恐惧 her.

[.my2]
必须问这个问题的想法简直吓坏了她。

If they tell me I have to, then I'm trapped," was her reaction.

[.my2]
“如果他们告诉我必须这样做，那我就被困住了，”这是她的反应。

She also heard the question as, "You're screwing me out of money 骗走我的钱；坑我的钱 and it has to stop." That sounded like the first step to her getting fired 被解雇；被开除 as a consultant 顾问；咨询师。

[.my2]
她还将这个问题理解为：“你在骗走我的钱，这必须停止。”在她听来，这听起来像是她作为顾问被解雇的第一步。

I explained to her that this implication 暗示；含义, though real, was in her mind.

[.my2]
我向她解释说，这个暗示，虽然是真实存在的，但只存在于她的脑海中。

Her client would hear the words and not the implication as long as 只要；若是 she kept calm 保持平静；镇定自若 and avoided making it sound by her delivery like an accusation 指控；谴责 or threat 威胁；恐吓。

[.my2]
只要她保持平静，并避免通过她的表达方式使其听起来像是一种指控或威胁，她的客户就会听到这些话语而不是暗示。

As long as she stayed cool, they would hear it as a problem to be solved.

[.my2]
只要她保持冷静，他们就会将其视为一个有待解决的问题。

She didn't quite 并不完全；不很 believe me.

[.my2]
她并不完全相信我。

We walked through 走过；演练 the script 脚本；台词 several times, but she was still afraid.

[.my2]
我们演练了脚本好几次，但她仍然害怕。

Then a few days later, she called me totally giddy with happiness 因幸福而头晕目眩；欣喜若狂。

[.my2]
几天后，她给我打电话，欣喜若狂。

The client had called with another request, and she had finally gotten up the courage 鼓起勇气；下定决心 to summarize the situation and ask, "How am I supposed to do that?" And you know what the answer she got was? You're right.

[.my2]
客户又打来电话提出了另一个请求，她终于鼓起勇气总结了情况，问道：“我该怎么做？”你知道她得到的答案是什么吗？“你说得对。

You can't, and I apologize 道歉；认错。

[.my2]
你不能，我道歉。”

Her client explained that they were going through 经历；遭受 some internal problems 内部问题；内部麻烦, but she was given a new accounting contact 会计联系人；财务联系人 and told she'd be paid within 48 hours.

[.my2]
她的客户解释说他们正在经历一些内部问题，但她得到了一个新的会计联系人，并被告知将在 48 小时内得到付款。

And she was.

[.my2]
她确实得到了付款。

Now, think about how my client's question worked.

[.my2]
现在，想想我的客户的问题是如何起作用的。

Without accusing them of anything, it pushed the big company to understand her problem and offer the solution 解决方案；解决办法 she wanted.

[.my2]
在没有指责他们任何事情的情况下，它推动了那家大企业去理解她的问题，并提供了她想要的解决方案。

That, in a nutshell 简而言之；概括地说, is the whole point of open-ended questions that are calibrated for a specific effect 特定效果；特定目的。

[.my2]
简而言之，这就是经过校准以达到特定效果的开放式问题的全部意义。

Like the softening words 缓和词语；柔和词语 and phrases 措辞；短语 perhaps 也许；可能, maybe 也许；可能, I think, and it seems 似乎；好像, the calibrated open-ended question takes the aggression 攻击性；侵略性 out of a confrontational statement 对抗性陈述；冲突性声明 or close-ended request 封闭式请求；明确要求的请求 that might otherwise 否则；不然 anger 激怒；使发怒 your counterpart.

[.my2]
就像也许、可能、我想和似乎这些缓和词语和措辞一样，经过校准的开放式问题消除了本来可能激怒你的对手的对抗性陈述或封闭式请求中的攻击性。

What makes them work is that they are subject to interpretation 受制于解释；有待于理解 by your counterpart instead of being rigidly defined 严格定义；僵硬限定。

[.my2]
它们之所以有效，是因为它们受制于你的对手的解释，而不是被严格限定。

They allow you to introduce ideas and requests without sounding overbearing 傲慢的；专横的 or pushy 咄咄逼人的；强迫的。

[.my2]
它们允许你引入想法和请求而不显得傲慢或咄咄逼人。

And that's the difference between you're screwing me out of money and it has to stop and how am I supposed to do that? The real beauty 真正美妙之处；真正妙处 of calibrated questions is the fact that they offer no target for attack 攻击目标；抨击对象 like statements do.

[.my2]
这就是“你在骗走我的钱，这必须停止”和“我该怎么做？”之间的区别。经过校准的问题的真正美妙之处在于，它们不像陈述那样提供任何攻击目标。

Calibrated questions have the power to educate 教育；指导 your counterpart on what the problem is rather than 而不是；并非 causing conflict 引起冲突；造成矛盾 by telling them what the problem is.

[.my2]
经过校准的问题有能力指导你的对手认识问题是什么，而不是通过告诉他们问题是什么来引起冲突。

But calibrated questions are not just random 随机的；随意的 requests for comment 征求意见；评论请求。

[.my2]
但经过校准的问题并不仅仅是随机征求意见。

They have a direction 方向；目标。

[.my2]
它们有方向。

Once you figure out 弄清楚；想明白 where you want a conversation to go, you have to design 设计；构思 the questions that will ease the conversation in that direction while letting the other guy think it's his choice to take you there.

[.my2]
一旦你弄清楚你希望对话走向何方，你就必须设计那些将使对话朝那个方向顺利进行的问题，同时让对方认为是他自己的选择带你到那里。

That's why I refer to 称作；指代 these questions as calibrated questions.

[.my2]
这就是为什么我将这些问题称作经过校准的问题。

You have to calibrate them carefully, just like you would calibrate a gun site 瞄准器；枪瞄 or a measuring scale 测量秤；刻度尺 to target a specific problem.

[.my2]
你必须仔细地校准它们，就像你校准瞄准器或刻度尺以针对一个特定问题一样。

The good news is that there are rules for that.

[.my2]
好消息是有相应的规则。

First off, calibrated questions avoid verbs 动词；谓语 or words like can, is, are, do, or does.

[.my2]
首先，经过校准的问题避免使用 can, is, are, do 或 does 之类的动词或词语。

These are closedended questions that can be answered with a simple yes or a no.

[.my2]
这些是封闭式问题，可以用简单的是或否来回答。

Instead, they start with a list of words people know as reporters questions 记者式问题；新闻提问。

[.my2]
相反，它们以人们熟知的记者式问题中的一系列词语开头。

Who, what, when, where, why, and how.

[.my2]
谁、什么、何时、何地、为什么和如何。

Those words inspire 激励；启发 your counterpart to think and then speak expansively 广泛地；广阔地。

[.my2]
这些词语激励你的对手去思考，然后广泛地表达。

But let me cut the list even further.

[.my2]
但让我进一步缩减这个列表。

It's best to start with what, how, and sometimes why.

[.my2]
最好从什么、如何开始，有时是为什么。

Nothing else.

[.my2]
没有别的。

Who, when, and where will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking, and why can backfire 适得其反；产生负面影响 regardless of 不管；不顾 what language the word why is translated into, it's accusatory 控诉的；指责的。

[.my2]
谁、何时和何地通常只会让你的对手不假思索地分享一个事实，而为什么可能会适得其反，不管“为什么”这个词被翻译成什么语言，它都是指责性的。

There are very rare moments 非常罕见的时刻；极少数情况 when this is to your advantage 有利；有益。

[.my2]
在极少数情况下，这对你有利。

The only time you can use why successfully is when the defensiveness 防御性；戒心 that is created supports 支持；有助于 the change you are trying to get them to see.

[.my2]
你唯一可以成功使用“为什么”的时候，是当所产生的防御性有助于你试图让他们看到的改变时。

Why would you ever change from the way you've always done things and try my approach is an example.

[.my2]
“你为什么要改变你一直以来的做法，尝试我的方法呢？”就是一个例子。

Why would your company ever change from your long-standing vendor 长期供应商；老供应商 and choose our company is another.

[.my2]
“你公司为什么要改变你的长期供应商而选择我们公司呢？”是另一个例子。

As always, tone of voice 语气；声调 respectful 尊重的；恭敬的 and differential 恭顺的；谦恭的 is critical 关键的；至关重要的。

[.my2]
一如既往，尊重和恭顺的语气是至关重要的。

Otherwise 否则；不然, treat why like a burner on a hot stove 炉灶上的炉头；热炉灶头。

[.my2]
否则，对待“为什么”就像对待热炉灶头上的炉头一样。

Don't touch it.

[.my2]
不要碰它。

Having just two words to start with might not seem like a lot of ammunition 弹药；武器, but trust me, you can use what and how to calibrate nearly any question.

[.my2]
只有两个词可以开始可能看起来不像是很多弹药，但相信我，你可以使用“什么”和“如何”来校准几乎任何问题。

Does this look like something you would like? Can become, "How does this look to you?" or "What about this works for you?" You can even ask, "What about this doesn't work for you?" and you'll probably trigger quite a bit of useful 有用的；实用的 information from your counterpart.

[.my2]
“这看起来像你喜欢的东西吗？”可以变成：“这对你来说怎么样？”或者“关于这个，什么对你有用？”你甚至可以问：“关于这个，什么对你没用？”而且你可能会从你的对手那里触发相当多的有用信息。

Even something as harsh 严厉的；刺耳的 as why did you do it can be calibrated to what caused 导致；引起 you to do it which takes away the emotion 情绪；情感 and makes the question less accusatory.

[.my2]
甚至像“你为什么这样做”这样严厉的话语也可以被校准为“什么导致你这样做”，这去除了情感，使问题不那么具有指责性。

You should use calibrated questions early and often 经常地；频繁地 and there are a few that you will find that you will use in the beginning of nearly every negotiation.

[.my2]
你应该及早并经常地使用经过校准的问题，你会发现有几个问题你几乎在每次谈判开始时都会使用。

What is the biggest challenge 挑战；难题 you face is one of those questions.

[.my2]
“你面临的最大挑战是什么”就是其中之一。

It just gets the other side to teach you something about themselves, which is critical to any negotiation because all negotiation is an information gathering process.

[.my2]
它只是让对方教你一些关于他们自己的事情，这对任何谈判都至关重要，因为所有的谈判都是一个信息收集过程。

Here are some other great standbys 备用方案；可靠的选择 that I use in almost every negotiation depending on 取决于；视情况而定 the situation.

[.my2]
这里还有一些我在几乎每次谈判中都会使用的其他很棒的备用方案，取决于具体情况。

What about this is important to you? How can I help to make this better for us? How would you like me to proceed 进行；开始行动? What is it that brought us into this situation? How can we solve this problem? What's the objective 目标；目的? What are we trying to accomplish 完成；实现 here? How am I supposed to do that? The implication 暗示；含义 of any well-designed 精心设计的；良好构思的, calibrated question is that you want what the other guy wants, but you need his intelligence 智慧；智力 to overcome 克服；战胜 the problem.

[.my2]
“关于这个，什么对你很重要？”“我如何能帮助我们做得更好？”“你希望我如何进行？”“是什么让我们陷入这种境地的？”“我们如何能解决这个问题？”“目标是什么？”“我们试图在这里完成什么？”“我该怎么做？”任何精心设计的经过校准的问题的含义是，你想要对方想要的东西，但你需要他的智慧来克服这个问题。

This really appeals to 吸引；迎合 very aggressive 咄咄逼人的；有攻击性的 or egotistical 自负的；利己的 counterparts.

[.my2]
这确实吸引了非常咄咄逼人或自负的对手。

You've not only implicitly 含蓄地；不言而喻地 asked for help, triggering goodwill 善意；好意 and less defensiveness 防御性；戒心, but you've engineered 精心策划；巧妙地安排 a situation in which your formerly 以前的；从前的 recalcitrant 顽抗的；不服从的 counterpart is now using his mental and emotional resources 资源；手段 to overcome your challenges.

[.my2]
你不仅含蓄地寻求了帮助，触发了善意和更少的防御性，而且你精心策划了一个局面，在这个局面中，你以前顽抗的对手现在正在使用他的精神和情感资源来克服你的挑战。

It is the first step in your counterpart internalizing 内化；吸收 your way and the obstacles 障碍；阻碍 in it as his own.

[.my2]
这是你的对手将你的方式及其中的障碍内化为他自己的方式的第一步。

And that guides the other party toward designing a solution, your solution.

[.my2]
这引导对方设计一个解决方案，你的解决方案。

Think back to how the doctor used calibrated questions to get his patient to stay.

[.my2]
回想一下医生如何使用经过校准的问题让他的病人留下。

As his story showed, the key to getting people to see things your way is not to confront 对抗；面对 them on their ideas.

[.my2]
正如他的故事所示，让人们以你的方式看待事物的关键不在于对抗他们的想法。

You can't leave.

[.my2]
“你不能离开。”

But to acknowledge 承认；认可 their ideas openly, I understand why you're pissed off.

[.my2]
而是公开承认他们的想法：“我理解你为什么生气。”

And then guide them towards solving the problem.

[.my2]
然后引导他们解决问题。

What do you hope to accomplish by leaving? Like I said before, the secret to gaining the upper hand 占上风；取得优势 in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control.

[.my2]
“你希望通过离开完成什么？”就像我之前说的，在谈判中占上风的秘诀是给予对方控制的错觉。

That's why calibrated questions are ingenious 巧妙的；聪明的。

[.my2]
这就是为什么经过校准的问题是巧妙的。

Calibrated questions make your counterpart feel like they're in charge 负责；掌管, but it's really you who are framing 组织；构建 the conversation.

[.my2]
经过校准的问题让你的对手觉得他们在负责，但真正组织对话的是你。

Your counterpart will have no idea how constrained 受约束的；受限制的 they are by your questions.

[.my2]
你的对手将不知道他们受到你的问题多大的约束。

Once I was negotiating with one of my FBI bosses 老板；上司 about attending 参加；出席 a Harvard executive program 哈佛高管项目；哈佛行政管理课程。

[.my2]
有一次，我正在与我的一个联邦调查局上司谈判关于参加哈佛高管项目的事情。

He had already approved 批准；同意 the expenditure 支出；花费 for the travel, but on the day before I was supposed to leave, he called me into his office and began to question the validity 有效性；正当性 of the trip.

[.my2]
他已经批准了这次旅行的支出，但在我本该离开的前一天，他叫我进了他的办公室，开始质疑这次旅行的正当性。

I knew him well enough to know that he was trying to show me that he was in charge.

[.my2]
我足够了解他，知道他试图向我表明他在负责。

So, after we talked for a while, I looked at him and asked, "When you originally 最初；原来 approved this trip, what did you have in mind 心里想；意图是?" He visibly 明显地；看得出来 relaxed as he sat back in his chair and brought the top of his fingers and thumbs together in the shape of a steeple 尖塔；教堂高塔。

[.my2]
所以，在我们聊了一会儿之后，我看着他问道：“当你最初批准这次旅行时，你心里是怎么想的？”他明显地放松下来，向后靠在椅子上，将手指和拇指的指尖合拢成尖塔的形状。

Generally, this is a body language 肢体语言；身体语言 that means the person feels superior 优越的；高人一等的 and in charge.

[.my2]
通常，这是一种肢体语言，意味着这个人感觉自己高人一等并在负责。

Listen, he said, just make sure you brief 汇报；简报 everyone when you get back.

[.my2]
“听着，”他说，“确保你回来时给每个人汇报一下。”

That question calibrated to acknowledge 承认；认可 his power and nudge 轻推；推动 him toward explaining himself gave him the illusion of control.

[.my2]
那个经过校准以承认他的权力并推动他自我解释的问题，给了他控制的错觉。

And it got me just what I wanted.

[.my2]
而且它让我得到了我想要的东西。

How not to get paid.

[.my2]
如何不被付款。

Let's pause 暂停；停顿 for a minute here because there's one vitally 极其；非常 important thing you have to remember when you enter a negotiation 谈判；协商 armed with 装备着；拥有 your list of calibrated questions 经过校准的问题；精确化问题。

[.my2]
让我们在这里暂停一分钟，因为当你带着你的经过校准的问题列表进入谈判时，有一件极其重要的事情你必须记住。

That is all of this is great, but there's a rub 难题；症结。

[.my2]
那就是所有这一切都很棒，但有一个症结。

Without self-control 自我控制；自制 and emotional regulation 情感调节；情绪管理, it doesn't work.

[.my2]
没有自我控制和情感调节，它是行不通的。

The very first thing I talk about when I'm training 培训；训练 new negotiators is the critical 至关重要的；关键的 importance of self-control.

[.my2]
我在培训新谈判者时谈到的第一件事就是自我控制至关重要的重要性。

If you can't control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence 影响；说服 the emotions of another party 另一方；另一当事人? To show you what I mean, let me tell you a story.

[.my2]
如果你无法控制自己的情绪，你又如何期望影响另一方的情绪？为了向你展示我的意思，让我给你讲一个故事。

Not long ago, a freelance 自由职业的；特约的 marketing strategist 营销策略师；市场战略家 came to me with a problem.

[.my2]
不久前，一位自由职业的营销策略师带着一个问题来找我。

One of her clients 客户；委托人 had hired 聘请；雇佣 a new CEO 首席执行官；总裁, a penny pincher 吝啬鬼；小气鬼 whose strategy 策略；战略 was to cut costs 削减成本；降低费用 by offshoring 转移到海外；外包 everything he could.

[.my2]
她的一个客户聘请了一位新的首席执行官，一个吝啬鬼，他的策略是通过外包他能做的一切来削减成本。

He was also a male chauvinist 大男子主义者；沙文主义者 who didn't like the assertive 坚定的；果断的 style in which the strategist, a woman, conducted 表现；进行 herself.

[.my2]
他也是一个大男子主义者，不喜欢这位策略师（一位女性）表现自己的坚定风格。

Immediately, my client and the CEO started to go at each other 互相攻击；互相指责 on conference calls 电话会议；视频会议 in that passive aggressive 被动攻击的；消极抵抗的 way that is everpresent 无处不在的；普遍存在的 in corporate America 企业界；美国商业界。

[.my2]
我的客户和首席执行官立即开始在电话会议上以那种在美国企业界无处不在的被动攻击方式互相指责。

After a few weeks of this, my client decided she'd had enough and invoiced 开具发票；要求付款 the CEO for the last bit of work she'd done, about $7,000, and politely said that the arrangement 安排；协议 wasn't working out 没有成功；不奏效。

[.my2]
几周后，我的客户决定她受够了，并向首席执行官开具了发票，要求支付她所做的最后一点工作的费用，大约 7,000 美元，并礼貌地表示该协议不奏效。

The CEO answered by saying the bill 账单；费用 was too high, that he'd pay half of it, and that they would talk about the rest.

[.my2]
首席执行官回答说账单太高了，他会付一半，剩下的再谈。

After that, he stopped answering her calls.

[.my2]
在那之后，他停止接听她的电话。

The underlying dynamic 根本的动态；潜在的机制 was that this guy didn't like being questioned 质疑；盘问 by anyone, especially a woman.

[.my2]
根本的机制是这个家伙不喜欢被任何人质疑，尤其是一个女人。

So she and I developed a strategy 策略；战略 that showed him she understood where she went wrong and acknowledged 承认；认可 his power while at the same time 同时；并且 directing his energy towards solving her problem.

[.my2]
于是她和我制定了一个策略，向他表明她明白自己哪里做错了，并承认了他的权力，同时将他的能量引向解决她的问题。

The script 脚本；台词 we came up with 想出；提出 hit all the best practices 最佳实践；最佳做法 of negotiation we've talked about so far 迄今为止；到目前为止。

[.my2]
我们想出的脚本符合我们迄今为止讨论过的所有谈判的最佳实践。

Here it is by steps.

[.my2]
以下是按步骤进行的。

One, a no oriented email question 以“不”为导向的邮件问题；寻求否定答案的邮件问题 to reinitiate contact 重新建立联系；再次接触。

[.my2]
一、一个以“不”为导向的邮件问题，重新建立联系。

Have you given up on 放弃；对…绝望 settling this amicably 友好地；和睦地? Two, a statement that leaves only the answer of that's right 对；是的 to form a dynamic of agreement 达成一致的动态；同意的氛围。

[.my2]
你是否已放弃友好地解决这个问题？二、一个陈述，它只留下“对”的答案，以形成同意的氛围。

It seems that you feel my bill is not justified 合理的；有道理的。

[.my2]
看来你认为我的账单不合理。

Three, calibrated questions about the problem to get him to reveal 揭示；透露 his thinking.

[.my2]
三、关于问题的经过校准的问题，以让他透露他的想法。

How does this bill violate 违反；违背 our agreement 协议；约定? Four, more nooriented questions to remove unspoken barriers 障碍；隔阂。

[.my2]
这个账单如何违反了我们的协议？四、更多以“不”为导向的问题，以消除未说出口的障碍。

Are you saying I misled 误导；欺骗 you? Are you saying I didn't do as you asked? Are you saying I reneggged on 违背；食言 our agreement or are you saying I failed you? Five.

[.my2]
你的意思是我误导了你吗？你的意思是我没有按照你要求的去做吗？你的意思是我违背了我们的协议吗，或者你的意思是我让你失望了吗？五。

Labeling and mirroring 贴标签和反射；标注和模仿 the essence 实质；精髓 of his answers if they are not acceptable 可接受的；可以接受的 so he has to consider 考虑；斟酌 them again.

[.my2]
如果他的答案不可接受，则标注并反射其实质，以便他必须重新考虑它们。

It seems like you feel my work was subpar 次于标准的；低于平均水平的 or my work was subpar.

[.my2]
看来你认为我的工作低于标准，或者我的工作低于标准。

Six.

[.my2]
六。

A calibrated question in reply to 回答；回应 any offer other than full payment 全额付款；付清款项 in order to get him to offer a solution.

[.my2]
一个经过校准的问题，回应任何非全额付款的提议，以便让他提供一个解决方案。

How am I supposed to accept that? Seven.

[.my2]
我该如何接受呢？七。

If none of this gets an offer of full payment, a label that flatters 奉承；阿谀 his sense of control and power.

[.my2]
如果所有这些都没有得到全额付款的提议，则标注一个奉承他的控制感和权力感的标签。

It seems like you are the type of person who prides himself on 以…为荣；自豪 the way he does business, rightfully so 理所当然地；毫无疑问地, and has a knack for 诀窍；天赋 not only expanding the pie 扩大蛋糕；做大市场, but making the ship run more efficiently 效率更高地；更有效地。

[.my2]
看来你是那种以自己的经商方式为荣的人，理所当然地，而且有一种诀窍，不仅能做大市场，还能让公司更有效地运作。

Eight.

[.my2]
八。

A long pause 长时间停顿；沉默。

[.my2]
一个长时间停顿。

And then one more nooriented question.

[.my2]
然后是再一个以“不”为导向的问题。

Do you want to be known as 被认为是；以…而闻名 someone who doesn't fulfill agreements 履行协议；兑现承诺? From my long experience in negotiation, scripts like this have a 90% success rate 成功率；成功比率。

[.my2]
你愿意被人认为是不履行协议的人吗？根据我在谈判中的长期经验，像这样的脚本有 90% 的成功率。

That is if the negotiator stays calm 保持冷静；镇定自若 and rational 理性的；合理的。

[.my2]
也就是说，如果谈判者保持冷静和理性。

And that's a big if 很大的一个“如果”；一个重要的假设。

[.my2]
而这是一个很大的一个“如果”。

In this case, she didn't.

[.my2]
在这种情况下，她没有。

The first step, the magic email, worked better than she imagined, and the CEO called within 10 minutes, surprising her.

[.my2]
第一步，“神奇的邮件”，比她想象的更有效，首席执行官在 10 分钟内打来了电话，这让她感到惊讶。

Almost immediately, her anger flared 爆发；燃起 at the sound of his patronizing 屈尊俯就的；傲慢的 voice.

[.my2]
几乎立刻，她一听到他傲慢的声音，她的怒火就爆发了。

Her only desire 愿望；渴望 became to show him how he was wrong, to impose 强加；硬性推行 her will 意志；意愿, and the conversation became a showdown 对决；摊牌 that went nowhere 毫无进展；没有结果。

[.my2]
她唯一的愿望变成了向他展示他错在哪里，强行推行她的意志，对话变成了一场毫无进展的对决。

You probably don't need me to tell you that she didn't even get half.

[.my2]
你可能不需要我告诉你，她甚至连一半都没拿到。

With that in mind, I want to end this chapter with some advice on how to remain 保持；维持 rational 理性的；合理的 in a negotiation.

[.my2]
考虑到这一点，我想用一些关于如何在谈判中保持理性的建议来结束本章。

Even with all the best techniques 技巧；技术 and strategy 策略；战略, you need to regulate 调节；控制 your emotions if you want to have any hope of coming out on top 获胜；成功。

[.my2]
即使拥有所有最好的技巧和策略，如果你希望获胜，你仍然需要控制你的情绪。

The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional cool 保持情绪冷静；保持镇定是 to bite your tongue 咬住舌头；忍住不言。

[.my2]
保持情绪冷静的第一个也是最基本的规则是忍住不言。

Not literally 照字面地；确实地, of course, but you have to keep away from 远离；避免 knee-jerk 膝跳反射式的；下意识的 passionate 激情的；情绪化的 reactions 反应；回应。

[.my2]
当然，不是真的“咬住你的舌头”，但你必须避免下意识的、情绪化的反应。

Pause, think, let the passion dissipate 消散；消失。

[.my2]
暂停，思考，让激情消散。

That allows you to collect your thoughts 集中思想；整理思绪 and be more circumspect 慎重的；周到的 in what you say.

[.my2]
这使你能够集中思想，在你说的话中更加慎重。

It also lowers 降低；减少 your chance of saying more than you want to.

[.my2]
它也降低了你说出比你想要说的更多的机会。

The Japanese have this figured out 弄明白；想通了。

[.my2]
日本人已经弄明白了这一点。

When negotiating with a foreigner 外国人；老外, it's common practice 常见做法；惯例 for a Japanese businessman to use a translator 翻译；译者 even when he understands perfectly 完美地；完全地 what the other side is saying.

[.my2]
与外国人谈判时，日本商人使用翻译是一种常见做法，即使他完全理解对方在说什么。

That's because speaking through a translator forces 强迫；迫使 him to step back 退后一步；抽身。

[.my2]
那是因为通过翻译说话迫使他退后一步。

It gives him time to frame his response 组织他的回应；措辞他的答复。

[.my2]
这给了他时间组织他的回应。

Another simple rule is when you are verbally assaulted 口头攻击；言语冒犯, do not counterattack 反击；反驳。

[.my2]
另一个简单的规则是，当你受到口头攻击时，不要反击。

Instead, disarm 解除武装；消除敌意 your counterpart by asking a calibrated question.

[.my2]
相反，通过询问经过校准的问题消除你的对手的敌意。

The next time a waiter 服务员；侍者 or sales clerk 售货员；店员 tries to engage you in 让你参与；引发 a verbal skirmish 口头争吵；小规模争论, try this out 试一试；检验。

[.my2]
下一次服务员或售货员试图引发你进行口头争吵时，试一试这个。

I promise you, it will change the entire tenor 基调；要旨 of the conversation.

[.my2]
我向你保证，它将改变整个对话的基调。

The basic issue 根本问题；主要症结 here is that when people feel that they are not in control, they adopt 采纳；采取 what psychologists 心理学家 call a hostage mentality 人质心态；被劫持心态。

[.my2]
这里的根本问题是，当人们感觉自己无法控制时，他们采取了心理学家所说的“人质心态”。

That is in moments of conflict 冲突；矛盾 they react to their lack of power 缺乏权力；无力感 by either becoming extremely defensive 极度防卫；非常戒备 or lashing out 猛烈抨击；发脾气。

[.my2]
也就是说，在冲突的时刻，他们通过要么变得极度防卫要么猛烈抨击来应对他们的无力感。

Neurologically 在神经学上；从神经学角度 in situations like this the fightor-flight mechanism 战斗或逃跑机制；应激反应 in the reptilian brain 爬行动物脑；本能脑 or the emotions in the lyic system 边缘系统；情绪脑 overwhelm 压倒；淹没 the rational part 理性部分；理性层面 of our mind the neoortex 新皮质；理性脑 leading us to overreact 反应过度；过度反应 in an impulsive 冲动的；鲁莽的 instinctive 本能的；直觉的 way in a negotiation like in the one between my client and the CEO.

[.my2]
在神经学上，在这种情况下，爬行动物脑中的战斗或逃跑机制或边缘系统中的情绪压倒了我们思维的理性部分——新皮质，导致我们在谈判中（就像我的客户和首席执行官之间的谈判一样）以冲动、本能的方式反应过度。

This always produces a negative outcome 负面结果；消极后果。

[.my2]
这总是产生负面结果。

So, we have to train 训练；培养 our neoortex to override 凌驾；取代 the emotions from the other two brains.

[.my2]
因此，我们必须训练我们的新皮质凌驾于来自其他两个大脑的情绪。

That means biting your tongue and learning how to mindfully change your state 有意识地改变状态；留心地改变状态 to something more positive 积极的；正面的。

[.my2]
这意味着要忍住不言，并学习如何有意识地将你的状态改变成更积极的东西。

And it means lowering the hostage mentality in your counterpart by asking a question or even offering an apology 道歉；赔礼。

[.my2]
这意味着通过询问问题甚至提供道歉来降低你的对手的人质心态。

You're right, that was a bit harsh 严厉的；苛刻的。

[.my2]
“你说得对，那有点严厉了。”

If you were able to take an armed 装备武装的；携带武器的 kidnapper who'd been surrounded by police and hook him up to 连接；接上 a cardiac monitor 心脏监护仪；心率监测器, you'd find that every calibrated question and apology would lower his heart rate 心率；脉搏 just a little bit.

[.my2]
如果你能够带走一个被警察包围的武装绑匪，并连接上心脏监护仪，你会发现每一个经过校准的问题和道歉都会稍微降低他的心率。

And that's how you get to a dynamic where solutions can be found.

[.my2]
这就是你达到一个可以找到解决方案的动态局势的方式。

Key lessons 关键教训；主要经验。

[.my2]
关键教训。

Who has control in a conversation? The guy listening 听者；倾听者 or the guy talking 说话者；交谈者? The listener, of course.

[.my2]
谁在对话中拥有控制权？听者还是说话者？当然是听者。

That's because the talker is revealing 揭示；透露 information while the listener, if he's trained well, is directing 指导；引导 the conversation toward his own goals 目标；目的。

[.my2]
那是因为说话者正在透露信息，而听者，如果他训练有素，正在将对话引导向他自己的目标。

He's harnessing 利用；驾驭 the talker's energy for his own ends 自己的目的；自身的利益。

[.my2]
他正在利用说话者的能量为自己的目的服务。

When you try to work the skills from this,

== pure

Create the illusion of control. + 

A month after I'd finished working the case of Jeffrey Schilling. + 

In May 2001, I got orders from headquarters to head back to Manila. + 

The same bad guys who' taken Schilling, a brutal group of radical Islamists named the Abu Sai, had raided the Dos Palma's private diving resort and taken 20 hostages, including three Americans. + 

Martin and Gracia Bernham, a missionary couple from Witchah, Kansas, and Guos Sobero, a guy who ran a California waterproofing firm. + 

Dos Palmas was a negotiator's nightmare from the start. + 

The day after the kidnappings, the recently elected Philippine President Gloria Makapagal Royo set up the most confrontational, nonconstructive dynamic possible by publicly declaring allout war on the Abu Sai. + 

Not exactly empathetic discourse, right? It got a lot worse. + 

The Philippine Army and Marines had a turf war in the midst of the negotiations, pissing off the kidnappers with several botched raids. + 

Because American hostages were involved, the CIA, the FBI, and US military intelligence were all called in, and we too squabbled among ourselves. + 

Then the kidnappers raped and killed several hostages. + 

9/11 happened, and the Abu Syaf was linked to al-Qaeda. + 

By the time the crisis concluded in an orgy of gunshots in June 2002, Dos Palmus had officially become the biggest failure in my professional life. + 

To call it a train wreck would be generous, if you know what I mean. + 

But failures plant the seeds of future success, and our failure in the Philippines was no exception. + 

If the dose palmus calamity showed me anything, it was that we all were still suffering under the notion that negotiation was a wrestling match where the point is to exhaust your opponent into submission, hope for the best, and never back down. + 

As my disappointment with Dose Palmus forced me to reckon with our failed techniques, I took a deep look into the newest negotiating theories, some great and some completely hairbrained, and I had a chance encounter with a case in Pittsburgh that completely changed how I looked at the interpersonal dynamics of negotiation conversations. + 

From the ashes of Dose Palmus, then we learned a lesson that would forever change how the FBI negotiated kidnappings. + 

We learned that negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming. + 

Co-opting, not defeating. + 

Most important, we learned that successful negotiation involved getting your counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself. + 

It involved giving him the illusion of control while you in fact were the one defining the conversation. + 

The tool we developed is something I call the calibrated or open-ended question. + 

What it does is remove aggression from conversations by acknowledging the other side openly without resistance. + 

In doing so, it lets you introduce ideas and requests without sounding pushy. + 

It allows you to nudge. + 

I'll explain it in depth later on, but for now, let me say that it's really as simple as removing the hostility from the statement you can't leave and turning it into a question. + 

What do you hope to achieve by going? Don't try to negotiate in a firefight. + 

The moment I arrived in Manila on the Burnham Sabaro case, I was sent down to the Mindanao region where the Philippine military was lobbing bullets and rockets into a hospital complex where the Abu Sai off and the hostages were holed up. + 

This was no place for a negotiator because it's impossible to have a dialogue in the middle of a firefight. + 

Then things got worse. + 

When I woke up the next morning, I learned that during the night, the kidnappers had taken their hostages and escaped. + 

The escape was the first sign that this operation was going to be a rolling train wreck and that the Philippine military was less than a trustworthy partner. + 

During debriefings following the episode, it was revealed that during a ceasefire, a military guy had collected a suitcase from the thugs in the hospital. + 

And not long after that, all the soldiers on the rear perimeter of the hospital had been called away for a meeting. + 

Coincidentally or not, the bad guys chose that moment to slip away. + 

Things really blew up two weeks later on the Philippines Independence Day when Abu Sabaya announced that he was going to behead one of the whites unless the government called off its manhunt by midday. + 

We knew this meant one of the Americans and anticipated it would be Guiermo Sobero. + 

We didn't have any direct contact with the kidnappers at the time because our partners in the Philippine military had assigned us an intermediary who always forgot to make sure we were present for his phone calls with the kidnappers and similarly forgot to tape them. + 

All we could do was send text messages offering to schedule a time to speak. + 

What ended up happening was that just before the noon deadline, Sabaya and a member of the Philippine presidential cabinet had a conversation on a radio talk show and the government conceded to Sabaya's demand to name a Malaysian senator as a negotiator. + 

In exchange, Sabaya agreed not to kill a hostage. + 

But it was too late to fix this atmosphere of confrontation, distrust, and lies. + 

That afternoon, the hostages heard Sabaya on the phone yelling, "But that was part of the agreement. + 

That was a part of the agreement." Not long after, the Abu Sai beheaded Golmo Sobero, and for good measure, the group took 15 more hostages. + 

With none of the important moving parts anywhere near under our control, and the United States largely uninterested in spite of Sober's murder, I headed back to Washington, DC. + 

It seemed like there was little we could do. + 

Then 9/11 changed everything. + 

Once a minor terrorist outfit, the Abu Sai was suddenly linked to al-Qaeda. + 

And then a Philippine TV reporter named Arlland de la Cruz got into the Abu Sai camp and videotaped Sabaya as he taunted the American missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham, who were so emaciated they looked like concentration camp survivors. + 

The video hit the US news media like thunder. + 

Suddenly, the case became a major US government priority. + 

There is always a team on the other side. + 

The FBI sent me back in. + 

Now I was sent in to make sure a deal got made. + 

It was all very highprofile, too. + 

Some of my contacts reported that FBI Director Robert Mueller was personally briefing President George W. + 

Bush every morning on what we were doing. + 

When Director Mueller showed up in the US s embassy in Manila and I was introduced to him, a look of recognition came over his face. + 

That was a very heady moment. + 

But all the support in the world won't work if your counterpart's team is dysfunctional. + 

If your negotiation efforts don't reach past your counterpart and into the team behind him, then you've got a hopebased deal, and hope is not a strategy. + 

One of the things I failed to fully appreciate then was that the kidnappers had changed negotiators themselves. + 

Sabaya had been replaced. + 

My boss, Gary Nosner, had in a previous kidnapping pointed out to me that a change in negotiators by the other side almost always signaled that they meant to take a harder line. + 

What I didn't realize at the time was this meant Sabaya was going to play a role as a deal breakaker if he wasn't accounted for. + 

Our new tac was to buy the Burnhams back. + 

Although the United States officially doesn't pay ransoms, a donor had been found who would provide $300,000. + 

The new Abu Sai negotiator agreed to a release. + 

The ransom drop was a disaster. + 

The kidnappers decided that they wouldn't release the Burnhams. + 

Or rather, Sabaya, who was physically in charge of the hostages, refused to release them. + 

He had cut his own side deal, one we didn't know about, and it had fallen through. + 

The new negotiator, now embarrassed and in a foul mood, covered himself by claiming that the payment was short $600. + 

We were baffled. + 

$600? you won't let hostages go because of $600. + 

And we tried to argue that if the money was missing, it must have been the courier who had stolen the money, but we had no dynamic of trust and cooperation to back us up. + 

The $300,000 was gone, and we were back to rarely answered text messages. + 

The slow motion wreck culminated about 2 months later with a botched rescue. + 

A team of Philippine scout rangers walking around in the woods came across the Abu Sai camp or so they said. + 

Later we heard another government agency had tipped them off. + 

That other government agency OGA had not told us about their location because because why? That's something I will never understand. + 

The scout rangers formed a skirmish line from a tree line above the camp and opened fire, indiscriminately pouring bullets into the area. + 

Gratzia and Martin were taking a nap in their hammocks when the fire started raining down. + 

They both fell out of their hammocks and started to roll down the hill towards safety. + 

But as a sheet of bullets from their rescuers fell on them, Gracia felt a searing burn flare through her right thigh. + 

And then she felt Martin go limp. + 

Minutes later, after the last rebels fled, the squad of Philippine soldiers tried to reassure Gracia that her husband was fine, but she shook her head. + 

After a year in captivity, she had no time for fantasies. + 

Gracia knew her husband was dead, and she was right. + 

He'd been hit in the chest three times by friendly fire. + 

In the end, the supposed rescue mission killed two of the three hostages there that day. + 

A Philippine nurse named Edora Yap also died. + 

and the big fish, Sabaya, escaped to live a few more months. + 

From beginning to end, the 13-month mission was a complete failure, a waste of lives and treasure. + 

As I sat in the dark at home a few days later, dispirited and spent, I knew that something had to change. + 

We couldn't let this happen again. + 

If the hostages deaths were going to mean something, we would have to find a new way to negotiate, communicate, listen, and speak both with our enemies and with our friends. + 

Not for communication's sake, though. + 

No, we had to do it to win. + 

Avoid a showdown. + 

No two ways about it. + 

My return to the United States was a time of reckoning. + 

I questioned. + 

I even doubted some of what we were doing at the FBI. + 

If what we knew wasn't enough, we had to get better. + 

The real kick in the pants came after my return when I was reviewing information about the case, a lot of which we hadn't had in the field. + 

Among the piles of information was one fact that totally blew my mind. + 

Martin B had been overheard on a phone call to someone. + 

I wondered what in God's name our hostage was doing. + 

Talking on the phone without us knowing and with whom was he talking. + 

There's only one reason a hostage ever gets on a phone. + 

It's to provide proof of life. + 

Someone else had been trying to ransom the Burnhams out. + 

It turned out to be someone working for a crooked Philippine politician who'd been running a parallel negotiation for the Burnham's release. + 

He wanted to buy the hostages out himself in order to show up Philippine President Aoyo. + 

But it wasn't so much that this guy was going behind our backs that bothered me. + 

As is pretty clear already, there were a whole lot of underhanded things going on. + 

What really ate at me was that this schmuck, who wasn't an FBI trained hostage negotiator, had pulled off something that I hadn't been able to. + 

He'd gotten to speak to Martin Burnham on the phone for free. + 

That's when I realized that this crooked pole success where we had failed was a kind of metaphor for everything that was wrong with our one-dimensional mindset. + 

Beyond our problems with the Philippine military, the big reason we had no effective influence with the kidnappers and hostages was that we had this very tit fortat mentality. + 

Under that mentality, if we called up the bad guys, we were asking for something. + 

And if they gave it to us, we had to give them something back. + 

And so, because we were positive that the Burnhams were alive, we'd never bothered to call and ask for proof of life. + 

We were afraid to go into debt. + 

If we made an ask and they granted it, we'd owe. + 

Not making good on a debt risk the accusation of bad faith negotiation. + 

And bad faith in kidnappings gets people killed. + 

And of course, we didn't ask the kidnappers to talk directly to the hostage because we knew they'd say no and we were afraid of being embarrassed. + 

That fear was a major flaw in our negotiating mindset. + 

There is some information that you can only get through direct extended interactions with your counterpart. + 

We also needed new ways to get things without asking for them. + 

We needed to finesse making an ask with something more sophisticated than closedended questions with their yes no dynamic. + 

That's when I realized that what we had been doing wasn't communication. + 

It was verbal flexing. + 

We wanted them to see things our way and they wanted us to see it their way. + 

If you let this dynamic loose in the real world, negotiation breaks down and tensions flare. + 

That whole ethos permeated everything the FBI was doing. + 

Everything was a showdown and it didn't work. + 

Our approach to proof of life questions embodied all these problems. + 

At the time, we proved that our hostages were alive by devising questions that asked for a piece of information only the hostage could know. + 

Computer security style questions like, "What's the name of Martin's first dog?" or what's Martin's dad's middle name? This particular type of question had many failings, however. + 

For one thing, it had sort of become a signature of law enforcement in the kidnapping world. + 

When a family starts asking a question of that type, it's a near certainty that the cops are coaching them. + 

And that makes kidnappers very nervous. + 

Even beyond the nerves, you had the problem that answering questions like those required little if any effort. + 

The bad guys go and get the fact and give it to you right away because it's so easy. + 

Bang. + 

Bang. + 

It happens so fast that you didn't gain any tactical advantage, any usable information. + 

Any effort on their part toward a goal that serves you. + 

And all negotiation done well should be an information gathering process that vests your counterpart in an outcome that serves you. + 

Worst of all, the bad guys know that they have just given you something, a proof of life, which triggers this whole human reciprocity gene. + 

Whether we like to recognize it or not, a universal rule of human nature across all cultures is that when somebody gives you something, they expect something in return and they won't give anything else until you pay them back. + 

Now, we didn't want to trigger this whole reciprocity thing because we didn't want to give anything. + 

So what happened? All of our conversations became these paralyzed confrontations between two parties who wanted to extract something from each other but didn't want to give. + 

We didn't communicate out of pride and fear. + 

That's why we failed. + 

While numb skulls like this crooked Philippine politician just stumbled in and got what we so desperately needed, that is communication without reciprocity. + 

I sat back and wondered to myself, how the hell do we do that? Suspend unbelief. + 

While I was racking my brains over how this sleazy politician managed to get Martin Burnham on the phone while we never could, FBI Pittsburgh had a kidnapping case. + 

My partner Chuck brought me the tapes from the case because he thought it was funny. + 

You see, one Pittsburgh drug dealer had kidnapped the girlfriend of another Pittsburgh drug dealer. + 

And for whatever reason, the victim drug dealer came to the FBI for help. + 

Coming to the FBI seemed kind of contrary to his best interests, being a drug dealer and all, but he did it because no matter who you are, when you need help, you go to the FBI, right? On the tapes, our hostage negotiators are riding around with this drug dealer while he's negotiating with the other drug dealer. + 

Normally, we would have had the guy ask a bulletproof proof of life question like, "What was the name of the girlfriend's teddy bear when she was little, but in this situation, this drug dealer hadn't yet been coached on asking a correct question. + 

So, in the middle of the conversation with the kidnapper, he just blurts, "Hey, dog, how do I know she's all right?" And the funniest thing happened. + 

The kidnapper actually went silent for 10 seconds. + 

He was completely taken aback. + 

Then he said in a much less confrontational tone of voice, "Well, I'll put her on the phone. + 

I was floored because this unsophisticated drug dealer just pulled off a phenomenal victory in the negotiation." To get the kidnapper to volunteer to put the victim on the phone is massively huge. + 

That's when I had my holy moment and realized that this is the technique I'd been waiting for. + 

Instead of asking some closedended question with a single correct answer, he'd asked an open-ended yet calibrated one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve the problem. + 

I thought to myself, "This is perfect. + 

It's a natural and normal question, not a request for a fact. + 

It's a how question." And how engages because how asks for help. + 

Best of all, he doesn't owe the kidnapper a damn thing. + 

The guy volunteers to put the girlfriend on the phone. + 

He thinks it's his idea. + 

The guy who just offered to put the girlfriend on the line thinks he's in control. + 

And the secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control. + 

The genius of this technique is really well explained by something that the psychologist Kevin Dutton says in his book, Split-second Persuasion. + 

He talks about what he calls unbelief, which is active resistance to what the other side is saying, complete rejection. + 

That's where the two parties in a negotiation usually start. + 

If you don't ever get off that dynamic, you end up having showdowns as each side tries to impose its point of view. + 

You get two hard skulls banging against each other like in Dose Palmus. + 

But if you can get the other side to drop their unbelief, you can slowly work them to your point of view on the back of their energy, just like the drug dealer's question got the kidnapper to volunteer to do what the drug dealer wanted. + 

You don't directly persuade them to see your ideas. + 

Instead, you ride them to your ideas. + 

As the saying goes, the best way to ride a horse is in the direction in which it is going. + 

Our job as persuaders is easier than we think. + 

It's not to get others believing what we say. + 

It's just to stop them unbelieving. + 

Once we achieve that, the game's half won. + 

Unbelief is the friction that keeps persuasion in check. + 

Dutton says, "Without it, there'd be no limits." Giving your counterpart the illusion of control by asking calibrated questions, by asking for help, is one of the most powerful tools for suspending unbelief. + 

Not long ago, I read this great article in the New York Times by a medical student who was faced with a patient who had ripped out his IV, packed his bags, and was making a move to leave because his biopsy results were days late and he was tired of waiting. + 

Just then, a senior physician arrived. + 

After calmly offering the patient a glass of water and asking if they could chat for a minute, he said he understood why the patient was pissed off and promised to call the lab to see why the results were delayed. + 

But what he did next is what really suspended the patients unbelief. + 

He asked a calibrated question, what he felt was so important about leaving. + 

And then when the patient said he had errands to handle, the doctor offered to connect the patient with services that could help him get them done. + 

And boom, the patient volunteered to stay. + 

What's so powerful about the senior doctor's technique is that he took what was a showdown, I'm going to leave versus you can't leave, and asked questions that led the patient to solve his own problem in the way the doctor wanted. + 

It was still a kind of showdown, of course, but the doctor took the confrontation and bravado out of it by giving the patient the illusion of control. + 

As an old Washington Post editor named Robert Estbrook once said, "He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation." This same technique for suspending unbelief that you use with kidnappers and escaping patients works for anything, even negotiating prices. + 

When you go into a store, instead of telling the sales clerk what you need, you can describe what you're looking for and ask for suggestions. + 

Then, once you've picked out what you want, instead of hitting them with a hard offer, you can just say, "The price is a bit more than you budgeted." And ask for help with one of the greatest of all time calibrated questions. + 

How am I supposed to do that? The critical part of this approach is that you really are asking for help and your delivery must convey that. + 

With this negotiating scheme, instead of bullying the clerk, you're asking for their advice and giving them the illusion of control. + 

Asking for help in this manner after you've already been engaged in a dialogue is an incredibly powerful negotiating technique for transforming encounters from confrontational showdowns into joint problem-solving sessions. + 

And calibrated questions are the best tool. + 

Calibrate your questions. + 

A few years ago, I was consulting with a client who had a small firm that did public relations for a large corporation. + 

The folks at the big company were not paying their bills. + 

And as time went on, they owed my client more and more money. + 

They kept her on the hook by promising lots of repeat business, implying that she would get a pile of revenue if she just kept working. + 

She felt trapped. + 

My advice for her was simple. + 

I told her to engage them in a conversation where she summarized the situation and then asked, "How am I supposed to do that?" She shook her head. + 

"No way. + 

The idea of having to ask this question just terrified her. + 

If they tell me I have to, then I'm trapped," was her reaction. + 

She also heard the question as, "You're screwing me out of money and it has to stop." That sounded like the first step to her getting fired as a consultant. + 

I explained to her that this implication, though real, was in her mind. + 

Her client would hear the words and not the implication as long as she kept calm and avoided making it sound by her delivery like an accusation or threat. + 

As long as she stayed cool, they would hear it as a problem to be solved. + 

She didn't quite believe me. + 

We walked through the script several times, but she was still afraid. + 

Then a few days later, she called me totally giddy with happiness. + 

The client had called with another request, and she had finally gotten up the courage to summarize the situation and ask, "How am I supposed to do that?" And you know what the answer she got was? You're right. + 

You can't, and I apologize. + 

Her client explained that they were going through some internal problems, but she was given a new accounting contact and told she'd be paid within 48 hours. + 

And she was. + 

Now, think about how my client's question worked. + 

Without accusing them of anything, it pushed the big company to understand her problem and offer the solution she wanted. + 

That, in a nutshell, is the whole point of open-ended questions that are calibrated for a specific effect. + 

Like the softening words and phrases perhaps, maybe, I think, and it seems, the calibrated open-ended question takes the aggression out of a confrontational statement or close-ended request that might otherwise anger your counterpart. + 

What makes them work is that they are subject to interpretation by your counterpart instead of being rigidly defined. + 

They allow you to introduce ideas and requests without sounding overbearing or pushy. + 

And that's the difference between you're screwing me out of money and it has to stop and how am I supposed to do that? The real beauty of calibrated questions is the fact that they offer no target for attack like statements do. + 

Calibrated questions have the power to educate your counterpart on what the problem is rather than causing conflict by telling them what the problem is. + 

But calibrated questions are not just random requests for comment. + 

They have a direction. + 

Once you figure out where you want a conversation to go, you have to design the questions that will ease the conversation in that direction while letting the other guy think it's his choice to take you there. + 

That's why I refer to these questions as calibrated questions. + 

You have to calibrate them carefully, just like you would calibrate a gun site or a measuring scale to target a specific problem. + 

The good news is that there are rules for that. + 

First off, calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like can, is, are, do, or does. + 

These are closedended questions that can be answered with a simple yes or a no. + 

Instead, they start with a list of words people know as reporters questions. + 

Who, what, when, where, why, and how. + 

Those words inspire your counterpart to think and then speak expansively. + 

But let me cut the list even further. + 

It's best to start with what, how, and sometimes why. + 

Nothing else. + 

Who, when, and where will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking, and why can backfire regardless of what language the word why is translated into, it's accusatory. + 

There are very rare moments when this is to your advantage. + 

The only time you can use why successfully is when the defensiveness that is created supports the change you are trying to get them to see. + 

Why would you ever change from the way you've always done things and try my approach is an example. + 

Why would your company ever change from your long-standing vendor and choose our company is another. + 

As always, tone of voice respectful and differential is critical. + 

Otherwise, treat why like a burner on a hot stove. + 

Don't touch it. + 

Having just two words to start with might not seem like a lot of ammunition, but trust me, you can use what and how to calibrate nearly any question. + 

Does this look like something you would like? Can become, "How does this look to you?" or "What about this works for you?" You can even ask, "What about this doesn't work for you?" and you'll probably trigger quite a bit of useful information from your counterpart. + 

Even something as harsh as why did you do it can be calibrated to what caused you to do it which takes away the emotion and makes the question less accusatory. + 

You should use calibrated questions early and often and there are a few that you will find that you will use in the beginning of nearly every negotiation. + 

What is the biggest challenge you face is one of those questions. + 

It just gets the other side to teach you something about themselves, which is critical to any negotiation because all negotiation is an information gathering process. + 

Here are some other great standbys that I use in almost every negotiation depending on the situation. + 

What about this is important to you? How can I help to make this better for us? How would you like me to proceed? What is it that brought us into this situation? How can we solve this problem? What's the objective? What are we trying to accomplish here? How am I supposed to do that? The implication of any well-designed, calibrated question is that you want what the other guy wants, but you need his intelligence to overcome the problem. + 

This really appeals to very aggressive or egotistical counterparts. + 

You've not only implicitly asked for help, triggering goodwill and less defensiveness, but you've engineered a situation in which your formerly recalcitrant counterpart is now using his mental and emotional resources to overcome your challenges. + 

It is the first step in your counterpart internalizing your way and the obstacles in it as his own. + 

And that guides the other party toward designing a solution, your solution. + 

Think back to how the doctor used calibrated questions to get his patient to stay. + 

As his story showed, the key to getting people to see things your way is not to confront them on their ideas. + 

You can't leave. + 

But to acknowledge their ideas openly, I understand why you're pissed off. + 

And then guide them towards solving the problem. + 

What do you hope to accomplish by leaving? Like I said before, the secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control. + 

That's why calibrated questions are ingenious. + 

Calibrated questions make your counterpart feel like they're in charge, but it's really you who are framing the conversation. + 

Your counterpart will have no idea how constrained they are by your questions. + 

Once I was negotiating with one of my FBI bosses about attending a Harvard executive program. + 

He had already approved the expenditure for the travel, but on the day before I was supposed to leave, he called me into his office and began to question the validity of the trip. + 

I knew him well enough to know that he was trying to show me that he was in charge. + 

So, after we talked for a while, I looked at him and asked, "When you originally approved this trip, what did you have in mind?" He visibly relaxed as he sat back in his chair and brought the top of his fingers and thumbs together in the shape of a steeple. + 

Generally, this is a body language that means the person feels superior and in charge. + 

Listen, he said, just make sure you brief everyone when you get back. + 

That question calibrated to acknowledge his power and nudge him toward explaining himself gave him the illusion of control. + 

And it got me just what I wanted. + 

How not to get paid. + 

Let's pause for a minute here because there's one vitally important thing you have to remember when you enter a negotiation armed with your list of calibrated questions. + 

That is all of this is great, but there's a rub. + 

Without self-control and emotional regulation, it doesn't work. + 

The very first thing I talk about when I'm training new negotiators is the critical importance of self-control. + 

If you can't control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence the emotions of another party? To show you what I mean, let me tell you a story. + 

Not long ago, a freelance marketing strategist came to me with a problem. + 

One of her clients had hired a new CEO, a penny pincher whose strategy was to cut costs by offshoring everything he could. + 

He was also a male chauvinist who didn't like the assertive style in which the strategist, a woman, conducted herself. + 

Immediately, my client and the CEO started to go at each other on conference calls in that passive aggressive way that is everpresent in corporate America. + 

After a few weeks of this, my client decided she'd had enough and invoiced the CEO for the last bit of work she'd done, about $7,000, and politely said that the arrangement wasn't working out. + 

The CEO answered by saying the bill was too high, that he'd pay half of it, and that they would talk about the rest. + 

After that, he stopped answering her calls. + 

The underlying dynamic was that this guy didn't like being questioned by anyone, especially a woman. + 

So she and I developed a strategy that showed him she understood where she went wrong and acknowledged his power while at the same time directing his energy towards solving her problem. + 

The script we came up with hit all the best practices of negotiation we've talked about so far. + 

Here it is by steps. + 

One, a no oriented email question to reinitiate contact. + 

Have you given up on settling this amicably? Two, a statement that leaves only the answer of that's right to form a dynamic of agreement. + 

It seems that you feel my bill is not justified. + 

Three, calibrated questions about the problem to get him to reveal his thinking. + 

How does this bill violate our agreement? Four, more nooriented questions to remove unspoken barriers. + 

Are you saying I misled you? Are you saying I didn't do as you asked? Are you saying I reneggged on our agreement or are you saying I failed you? Five. + 

Labeling and mirroring the essence of his answers if they are not acceptable so he has to consider them again. + 

It seems like you feel my work was subpar or my work was subpar. + 

Six. + 

A calibrated question in reply to any offer other than full payment in order to get him to offer a solution. + 

How am I supposed to accept that? Seven. + 

If none of this gets an offer of full payment, a label that flatters his sense of control and power. + 

It seems like you are the type of person who prides himself on the way he does business, rightfully so, and has a knack for not only expanding the pie, but making the ship run more efficiently. + 

Eight. + 

A long pause. + 

And then one more nooriented question. + 

Do you want to be known as someone who doesn't fulfill agreements? From my long experience in negotiation, scripts like this have a 90% success rate. + 

That is if the negotiator stays calm and rational. + 

And that's a big if. + 

In this case, she didn't. + 

The first step, the magic email, worked better than she imagined, and the CEO called within 10 minutes, surprising her. + 

Almost immediately, her anger flared at the sound of his patronizing voice. + 

Her only desire became to show him how he was wrong, to impose her will, and the conversation became a showdown that went nowhere. + 

You probably don't need me to tell you that she didn't even get half. + 

With that in mind, I want to end this chapter with some advice on how to remain rational in a negotiation. + 

Even with all the best techniques and strategy, you need to regulate your emotions if you want to have any hope of coming out on top. + 

The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional cool is to bite your tongue. + 

Not literally, of course, but you have to keep away from knee-jerk passionate reactions. + 

Pause, think, let the passion dissipate. + 

That allows you to collect your thoughts and be more circumspect in what you say. + 

It also lowers your chance of saying more than you want to. + 

The Japanese have this figured out. + 

When negotiating with a foreigner, it's common practice for a Japanese businessman to use a translator even when he understands perfectly what the other side is saying. + 

That's because speaking through a translator forces him to step back. + 

It gives him time to frame his response. + 

Another simple rule is when you are verbally assaulted, do not counterattack. + 

Instead, disarm your counterpart by asking a calibrated question. + 

The next time a waiter or sales clerk tries to engage you in a verbal skirmish, try this out. + 

I promise you, it will change the entire tenor of the conversation. + 

The basic issue here is that when people feel that they are not in control, they adopt what psychologists call a hostage mentality. + 

That is in moments of conflict they react to their lack of power by either becoming extremely defensive or lashing out. + 

Neurologically in situations like this the fightor-flight mechanism in the reptilian brain or the emotions in the lyic system overwhelm the rational part of our mind the neoortex leading us to overreact in an impulsive instinctive way in a negotiation like in the one between my client and the CEO. + 

This always produces a negative outcome. + 

So, we have to train our neoortex to override the emotions from the other two brains. + 

That means biting your tongue and learning how to mindfully change your state to something more positive. + 

And it means lowering the hostage mentality in your counterpart by asking a question or even offering an apology. + 

You're right, that was a bit harsh. + 

If you were able to take an armed kidnapper who'd been surrounded by police and hook him up to a cardiac monitor, you'd find that every calibrated question and apology would lower his heart rate just a little bit. + 

And that's how you get to a dynamic where solutions can be found. + 

Key lessons. + 

Who has control in a conversation? The guy listening or the guy talking? The listener, of course. + 

That's because the talker is revealing information while the listener, if he's trained well, is directing the conversation toward his own goals. + 

He's harnessing the talker's energy for his own ends. +
