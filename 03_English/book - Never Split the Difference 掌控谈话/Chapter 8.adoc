[.my2]
他们知道他们感觉被逼到绝境了，而且他们最想让这种情况结束。

但有一个障碍。

The inmates were afraid that the prisoners who gave up 投降；放弃 after taking correctional officers 狱警；矫正官 hostage, not to mention 更不用说；何况 the warden, would end up beaten 挨打；被击败 and badly.

Crisis averted 危机避免；化险为夷, but barely 勉强地；几乎没有。

[.my2]
危机避免了，但只是勉强。

The point here is that your job as a negotiator isn't just to get to an agreement 协议；同意。

[.my2]
这里的重点是，你作为谈判者的工作不仅仅是达成协议。

[.my2]

[.my2]
你将使用的第一个也是最常见的“不”问题是“我该怎么做？”的某种形式。例如，“我们如何能筹集到那么多？”你的语气至关重要，因为这个措辞既可以表达为指控，也可以表达为寻求帮助。

I'd love to help, she said, but how am I supposed to do that? By indicating 表明；指出 her willingness 意愿；乐意 to work, but asking for help finding a way to do so, she left her deadbeat 赖账的；不负责任的 customer with no choice but to 别无选择；不得不 put her needs ahead of 优先考虑；把…放在前面 everything else, and she got paid.

[.my2]
她表明了自己愿意工作，但要求帮助找到一个这样做的方法，从而使她赖账的客户别无选择，只能将她的需求优先于其他一切，她也得到了报酬。

Besides saying no, the other key benefit 主要益处；关键好处 of asking how is quite literally 确实地；毫不夸张地说 that it forces your counterpart to consider and explain how a deal will be implemented 执行；实施。

[.my2]
除了说“不”之外，问“如何”的另一个主要益处确实地是，它迫使你的对手考虑并解释交易将如何实施。

A deal is nothing without good implementation.

[.my2]
没有好的实施，交易毫无意义。

Poor implementation 糟糕的实施；执行不力 is the cancer 癌症；祸害 that eats your profits 利润；收益。

[.my2]
执行不力是侵蚀你利润的祸害。

By making your counterparts articulate 清楚地表达；明确说明 implementation in their own words, your carefully calibrated 经过仔细校准的；精确的 how questions will convince 说服；使相信 them that the final solution 最终解决方案；最后办法 is their idea.

[.my2]
通过让你的对手用自己的话清楚地表达实施，你经过仔细校准的“如何”问题将说服他们，最终的解决方案是他们的想法。

And that's crucial 关键的；至关重要的。

[.my2]
这至关重要。

People always make more effort 做出更多努力；付出更多心血 to implement a solution when they think it's theirs.

[.my2]
当人们认为解决方案是自己的时，他们总是会付出更多心血去实施。

That is simply human nature 人性；人之常情。

[.my2]
这仅仅是人性。

That's why negotiation is often called the art of letting someone else have your way 按你的方式行事；听从你的意见。

[.my2]
这就是为什么谈判通常被称为“让别人听从你的意见的艺术”。

There are two key questions you can ask to push your counterparts to think they are defining success their way.

[.my2]
你可以问两个关键问题来促使你的对手认为他们正在用自己的方式定义成功。

How will we know we're on track 正轨；进展顺利? And how will we address things 处理；解决 if we find we're off track 偏离轨道；脱离正轨? When they answer, you summarize 总结；概括 their answers until you get that's right 对；是的。

[.my2]
我们如何知道我们进展顺利？如果我们发现我们脱离正轨，我们如何处理事情？当他们回答时，你总结他们的答案，直到你得到“对”。

Then you'll know they've bought in 接受；买账。

[.my2]
然后你就知道他们接受了。

On the flip side 另一方面；反过来, be wary of 提防；警惕 two telling signs 明显的迹象；泄露真相的迹象 that your counterpart doesn't believe the idea is theirs.

[.my2]
另一方面，要警惕你的对手不相信这个想法是他们自己的两个明显迹象。

As I've noted 指出；提到, when they say, "You're right," it's often a good indicator 指标；指示物 they are not vested in 投入；关心 what is being discussed.

[.my2]
正如我指出的，当他们说“你说得对”时，这通常是一个很好的指标，表明他们不关心正在讨论的事情。

And when you push for implementation and they say, "I'll try," you should get a sinking feeling 沉重感；不安感 in your stomach.

[.my2]
当你推动实施时，他们说“我会试试”时，你的心里应该感到不安。

Because this really means, "I plan to fail." When you hear either of these, dive back in 重新开始；深入 with calibrated how questions until they define the terms 条款；条件 of successful implementation in their own voice 自己的声音；亲自。

[.my2]
因为这真正意味着：“我打算失败。”当你听到其中任何一个时，就重新开始使用经过校准的“如何”问题，直到他们用自己的声音定义成功实施的条款。

Follow up by 采取后续行动；跟进 summarizing what they have said to get a that's right.

[.my2]
跟进他们的总结，以获得一个“对”。

Let the other side feel victory 胜利；成功。

[.my2]
让对方感受胜利。

Let them think it was their idea.

[.my2]
让他们认为那是他们的想法。

Subsume your ego 抑制自我；放下身段。

[.my2]
抑制你的自我。

Remember yes is nothing without how.

[.my2]
记住没有“如何”的“是”毫无意义。

So keep asking how and succeed influencing those behind the table 在幕后；间接参与者。

[.my2]
所以继续问“如何”，并成功地影响幕后的那些人。

A few weeks after Jose got back to the United States, I drove to his family's place in upstate New York 纽约上州；纽约州北部。

[.my2]
何塞回到美国几周后，我开车去了他在纽约上州的家。

I was thrilled 兴奋的；激动的 when Jose escaped, but the case left me with one nagging 持续的；烦人的 worry.

[.my2]
当何塞逃脱时，我很兴奋，但这件案子给我留下了一个持续的担忧。

Had my new strategy failed? You see, Jose had gotten home safely, but not because we'd negotiated his release 释放；获释。

[.my2]
我的新策略失败了吗？你看，何塞安全到家了，但不是因为我们谈判让他获释。

I worried that our winning had less to do with sth 与…关系不大；与…关系较小 our brilliant 卓越的；杰出的 strategy than with dumb luck 纯粹的运气；瞎蒙。

[.my2]
我担心我们的胜利与我们卓越的策略关系不大，而与纯粹的运气关系更大。

After being greeted warmly 热情地；热烈地 by Julie and her parents, Jose and I grabbed some coffee and sat down.

[.my2]
在被朱莉和她的父母热情地迎接后，何塞和我拿了些咖啡坐了下来。

I'd gone there to do what CNU referred to as 称之为；指代 a hostage survival debriefing 人质生还情况汇报；人质存活事后汇报。

[.my2]
我去那里是为了做反恐谈判组（CNU）称之为人质生还情况汇报的事情。

I was after insights 见解；洞察力 into how to better advise 建议；忠告 people facing 面对；面临 potential 潜在的；可能的 kidnappings how best to survive, not just physically 身体上；生理上, but psychologically 心理上；精神上。

[.my2]
我想获得见解，了解如何更好地建议那些面临潜在绑架的人如何最好地生存，不仅是身体上，而且是心理上。

I was also burning to 渴望；急切地想 find out what had occurred 发生；出现 behind the scenes 在幕后；私下里 because it seemed as if my new strategy hadn't worked.

[.my2]
我也急切地想找出私下里发生了什么，因为看起来我的新策略没有奏效。

Finally, the conversation came around to 转到；谈到 our use of calibrated questions.

[.my2]
最后，对话转到了我们使用的经过校准的问题。

You know what? He said the craziest 最疯狂的；最不可思议的 thing was that their negotiator was supposed to 应该；本应 stay in town and negotiate the deal.

[.my2]
“你知道吗？”他说最不可思议的事情是他们的谈判者本应留在镇上谈判交易。

But because Julie kept asking him questions he didn't really know for sure 确定地；肯定地 how to answer, he kept coming out to the jungle.

[.my2]
但因为朱莉一直问他一些他不确定如何回答的问题，他不得不一直来到丛林。

They all would get together 聚在一起；集合 and have a huge discussion 巨大的讨论；热烈的讨论 about how to respond.

[.my2]
他们都会聚在一起，就如何回应进行热烈的讨论。

They even thought about taking me into town and putting me on the phone because Julie was so persistent 坚持不懈的；执着的 with asking how did she know if I was okay.

[.my2]
他们甚至想过把我带进镇上，让我打电话，因为朱莉非常执着地问她如何知道我是否安全。

Right then, I knew we had the right tool.

[.my2]
就在那时，我知道我们有了正确的工具。

It was exactly the opposite 相反；对立 of the Burnham case where our negotiator cut the deal 达成协议；谈成交易 with one of the guys and then the rest of them took the $300,000 and said, "No, we're not doing that." Causing the other side to work that hard and forcing that much internal coordination 内部协调；内部配合 in service of 为…服务；为了 our own goals 目标；目的 was unprecedented 前所未有的；空前的。

[.my2]
这与伯纳姆的案子完全相反，在那个案子中，我们的谈判者与其中一个人达成了协议，然后其余的人拿了 30 万美元，说：“不，我们不会那样做。”让对方工作得如此努力，并为了我们自己的目标强迫进行如此多的内部协调是前所未有的。

Our negotiating strategy in Ecuador worked not just because the questions contributed to 促成；有助于 the environment that let Jose escape, but because they made sure the kidnappers, our counterparts, were all on the same page 达成共识；想法一致。

[.my2]
我们在厄瓜多尔的谈判策略奏效，不仅因为这些问题促成了让何塞逃脱的环境，而且因为它们确保了绑匪（我们的对手）都达成共识。

Yes, few hostage takers and few business dealmakers 交易撮合者；业务谈判人 fly solo 单独行动；单干。

[.my2]
是的，很少有人质劫持者和很少有业务谈判人单干。

But for the most part 大部分；通常, there are almost always other players 参与者；角色, people who can act as dealmakers or deal killers 交易破坏者；交易杀手。

[.my2]
但大多数情况下，几乎总是有其他参与者，这些人可以扮演交易撮合者或交易破坏者的角色。

If you truly want to get to yes and get your deal implemented, you have to discover 发现；找到 how to affect 影响；左右 these individuals.

[.my2]
如果你真的想达成“是”并实施你的交易，你必须找到如何影响这些人。

When implementation happens by committee 委员会；小组, the support 支持；拥护 of that committee is key.

[.my2]
当实施由委员会完成时，该委员会的支持是关键。

You always have to identify 识别；确定 and unearth 揭露；发掘 their motivations 动机；动因, even if you haven't yet identified each individual 个人；个体 on that committee.

[.my2]
你总是必须识别并揭露他们的动机，即使你尚未确定该委员会中的每个个体。

That can be easy as asking a few calibrated questions like, "How does this affect everybody else? How on board 参与；支持 are the people not on this call or simply what do your colleagues 同事；伙伴 see as their main challenges 挑战；难题 in this area 领域；方面."

[.my2]
这可以像问几个经过校准的问题一样简单，例如：“这如何影响其他人？不在这次通话中的人有多支持？或者简单地说，你的同事认为他们在这个领域的主要挑战是什么？”

The larger concept 更大的概念；核心理念 I'm explaining here is that in any negotiation you have to analyze 分析；研究 the entire negotiation space 谈判空间；协商环境 when other people will be affected by what is negotiated and can assert 维护；坚持 their rights 权利；权限 or power later on 以后；随后。

[.my2]
我在这里解释的核心理念是，在任何谈判中，你都必须分析整个谈判空间，因为其他人会受到谈判内容的影响，并可以在以后维护他们的权利或权力。

It's just stupid 愚蠢的；不明智的 to consider 考虑；顾及 only the interests 利益；兴趣 of those at the negotiation table.

[.my2]
只考虑谈判桌上那些人的利益是愚蠢的。

You have to beware of 提防；警惕 behind the table or level two players 第二层参与者；二级角色。

[.my2]
你必须提防幕后或第二层参与者。

That is parties 党派；当事人 that are not directly 直接地；直截了当地 involved 参与；卷入 but who can help implement 实施；执行 agreements they like and block 阻止；妨碍 ones they don't.

[.my2]
也就是说，那些没有直接参与，但可以帮助实施他们喜欢的协议和阻止他们不喜欢的协议的当事人。

You can't disregard 忽视；不顾 them.

[.my2]
你不能忽视他们。

Even when you're talking to a CEO, there could always be someone whispering 低语；私下说 into his ear.

[.my2]
即使当你和首席执行官说话时，也可能总是有人在他耳边低语。

At the end of the day 归根结底；到头来, the deal killers often are more important than the deal makers.

[.my2]
归根结底，交易破坏者通常比交易撮合者更重要。

Think back to the prison siege.

[.my2]
回想一下那次监狱围困。

It was almost ruined 毁掉；破坏 because one bit player 小角色；不重要的参与者 on our side was not totally on board 完全赞同；彻底支持。

[.my2]
它几乎被毁掉了，因为我们这边的一个小角色没有完全赞同。

That's what our use of calibrated questions in Ecuador avoided 避免；防止。

[.my2]
这就是我们在厄瓜多尔使用经过校准的问题所避免的。

And that's why Jose's case was a home run 本垒打；巨大成功。

[.my2]
这就是为什么何塞的案子是一个巨大成功。

It only takes one bit player to screw up 搞砸；弄糟 a deal.

[.my2]
只需要一个小角色就能搞砸一笔交易。

A few years into private practice 私人执业；独立执业, I'd lost sight of 忽视；忘记 the importance of assessing 评估；衡量 and influencing the hidden negotiation 隐藏的谈判；秘密协商 that happens behind the table, and I paid a substantial 巨大的；可观的 price.

[.my2]
我们认为我们获得了顶级决策者对这笔极其利润丰厚的交易完全的接受。

And then, as we were figuring out 弄清楚；解决 the small print 小字部分；细节条款, the deal fell off the table 交易告吹；谈不拢。

[.my2]
然后，就在我们弄清楚细节条款时，交易告吹了。

[.my2]
结果是，需要培训的部门主管破坏了交易。

也许这个人感到受到了威胁、轻视，或者以某种方式因他和他的人需要任何培训的想法而自尊心受损。

A surprisingly high percentage 比例；百分比 of negotiations hinge on 取决于；有赖于 something outside dollars and cents 金钱；钱财, often having more to do with self-esteem 自尊；自尊心, status 地位；身份, and other non-financial 非金融的；非经济的 needs.

[.my2]
令人惊讶的高比例的谈判取决于金钱以外的东西，通常更多地与自尊、地位和其他非经济的需求有关。

We'll never know now.

[.my2]
我们现在永远不会知道了。

The point is, we didn't care until too late 为时已晚；太迟了 because we convinced ourselves 说服自己；使自己相信 that we were on the phone with the only decision makers that mattered 重要的；有影响力的。

[.my2]
关键是，我们直到为时已晚才在意，因为我们说服自己，我们在电话里交谈的是唯一重要的决策者。

We could have avoided 避免；防止 all that had we asked a few calibrated questions like, "How does this affect everybody else? How on board is the rest of your team? How do we make sure that we deliver the right material 材料；内容 to the right people? How do we ensure 确保；保证 the managers of those we're training are fully on board 充分支持；完全参与?" If we had asked questions like that, the CEO and HR head would have checked with this guy, maybe even brought him into the conversation and saved us all a lot of pain 痛苦；麻烦。

[.my2]
如果我们问了几个经过校准的问题，例如：“这如何影响其他人？你的团队的其他人有多支持？我们如何确保我们将正确的内容交付给正确的人？我们如何保证我们培训的那些人的经理们完全支持？”我们就可以避免所有这一切。如果我们问了类似的问题，首席执行官和人力资源部主管就会与这个人核实，甚至可能让他也参与到对话中，为我们所有人省去很多麻烦。

在这里，我想谈谈你识别说谎者、消除混蛋的敌意以及吸引其他人所需的工具。

The kidnapper and Alistair were not there, but the kidnapper's wife was.

[.my2]
绑匪和阿拉斯廷不在那里，但绑匪的妻子在。

She told the police about another house they owned 拥有；持有。

[.my2]
她告诉警察他们拥有的另一栋房子。

The police quickly raided the other house, freed Alistair, and arrested 逮捕；拘捕 the kidnapper.

[.my2]
警察迅速突击检查了另一栋房子，释放了阿拉斯廷，并逮捕了绑匪。

There are plenty of 很多；大量 other tactics 策略；手段；招数, tools 工具；方法, and methods 方法；途径 for using subtle 微妙的；难以察觉的 verbal and non-verbal forms of communication to understand and modify 修改；改变 the mental states 精神状态；心理状态 of your counterpart.

[.my2]
还有很多其他策略、工具和方法，可以利用微妙的言语和非言语交流形式来理解和改变你的对手的心理状态。

As I run through 快速浏览；粗略查看 some of them here, I want you to take a moment to internalize 内化；吸收理解 each one.

[.my2]
当我在这里快速浏览其中一些时，我希望你花点时间内化每一个。

These are the kind of tools that can help observant 观察敏锐的；善于观察的 negotiators hit home runs 取得巨大成功；打出本垒打。

[.my2]
这些是可以帮助观察敏锐的谈判者取得巨大成功的工具。

The $73855\%$ rule 规则；法则。

[.my2]
$7-38-55\%$规则。

In two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike somebody, one UCLA psychology professor 心理学教授；心理学家 Albert Morabian created the $73855\%$ rule.

[.my2]
在两项关于什么让我们喜欢或不喜欢某人的著名研究中，一位加州大学洛杉矶分校心理学教授阿尔伯特·莫拉宾创建了7-38-55%规则。

That is only $7\%$ of a message is based on the words while $38\%$ comes from the tone of voice and $55\%$ from the speaker's body language 肢体语言；身体语言 and face.

[.my2]
也就是说，一条信息只有$7\%$是基于言语的，而$38\%$来自语气，$55\%$来自说话者的肢体语言和面部表情。

While these figures 数字；数据 mainly relate to 主要与…有关；主要涉及 situations where we are forming an attitude 态度；看法 about somebody, the rule nonetheless 尽管如此；仍然 offers a useful ratio 比例；比率 for negotiators.

[.my2]
虽然这些数据主要涉及我们正在形成对某人的态度的情况，但尽管如此，这条规则仍然为谈判者提供了一个有用的比例。

You see, body language and tone of voice, not words, are our most powerful assessment tools 评估工具；评判工具。

[.my2]
你看，肢体语言和语气，而不是言语，才是我们最强大的评估工具。

That's why I'll often fly great distances 很远的距离；长途跋涉 to meet someone face to face 面对面；当面, even when I can say much of what needs to be said over the phone.

[.my2]
这就是为什么我经常长途跋涉去当面见某人，即使我可以通过电话说出大部分需要说的话。

So, how do you use this rule? First, pay very close attention to 非常关注；密切注意 tone and body language to make sure they match up with 与…相符；与…一致 the literal meaning 字面意思；本来含义 of the words.

[.my2]
那么，你如何使用这条规则？首先，非常关注语气和肢体语言，以确保它们与言语的字面意思相符。

If they don't align 一致；对齐, it's quite possible 很可能；很有可能 that the speaker is lying or at least unconvinced 不相信的；未被说服的。

[.my2]
如果它们不一致，说话者很可能在撒谎，或者至少未被说服。

When someone's tone of voice or body language does not align with the meaning of the words they say, use labels 标签；标记 to discover 发现；找到 the source 来源；根源 of the inongruence 不一致；不协调。

[.my2]
当某人的语气或肢体语言与他们所说言语的含义不一致时，使用标签来发现不一致的根源。

Here's an example.

[.my2]
这里有一个例子。

You so we're agreed 达成一致；同意 them.

[.my2]
你：所以我们达成了一致。他们：是的。

Yes.

[.my2]
是的。

I heard you say yes, but it seemed like there was hesitation 犹豫；踌躇 in your voice.

[.my2]
我听到你说“是”，但你的声音中似乎有犹豫。

Oh, it's nothing really.

[.my2]
哦，真的没什么。

No, this is important.

[.my2]
不，这很重要。

Let's make sure we get this right 弄对；搞清楚。

[.my2]
让我们确保把这件事弄清楚。

Thanks.

[.my2]
谢谢。

I appreciate 感谢；感激 it.

[.my2]
我很感激。

This is the way to make sure your agreement gets implemented with no surprises 意外；惊奇 and your counterpart will be grateful 感激的；感谢的。

[.my2]
这是确保你的协议得到实施没有意外的方法，而且你的对手会很感激。

Your act of recognizing 认识到；承认 the inongruence and gently 轻轻地；温和地 dealing with it through a label will make them feel respected 受到尊重；被尊敬。

[.my2]
你认识到不一致并通过标签温和地处理它的行为会让他们感到受到尊重。

Consequently 结果；因此, your relationship of trust 信任关系；信赖关系 will be improved.

[.my2]
因此，你的信任关系将得到改善。

The rule of three 三原则；三个法则。

[.my2]
三原则。

I'm positive 肯定；确信 that sometime in your life, you've been involved in 参与；卷入 a negotiation where you got a yes that later turned out to be 结果是；证明是 a no.

[.my2]
我确信你一生中的某个时候参与过一次谈判，你得到了一个“是”，但后来证明是一个“不”。

Maybe the other party was lying to you, or maybe they were just engaged in 沉迷于；从事于 wishful thinking 痴心妄想；一厢情愿。

[.my2]
也许另一方在对你撒谎，或者也许他们只是沉迷于痴心妄想。

Either way 无论哪种方式；反正, this is not an uncommon experience 不寻常的经历；不常见的体验。

[.my2]
无论哪种方式，这不是一种不常见的体验。

This happens because there are actually three kinds of yes: commitment 承诺；保证, confirmation 确认；证实, and counterfeit 伪造的；假的。

[.my2]
发生这种情况是因为实际上有三种“是”：承诺、确认和伪造的。

As we discussed 讨论；论述 in chapter 5, so many pushy 咄咄逼人的；强人所难的 salesmen 销售员；推销员 try to trap 困住；诱捕 their clients into the commitment yes that many people get very good at the counterfeit yes.

[.my2]
正如我们在第 5 章中讨论的，太多咄咄逼人的推销员试图诱捕他们的客户做出承诺的“是”，以至于很多人非常擅长伪造的“是”。

One great tool for avoiding 避免；防止 this trap 陷阱；圈套 is the rule of three.

[.my2]
避免这个陷阱的一个好工具是三原则。

The rule of three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation.

[.my2]
三原则就是简单地让对方在同一次谈话中同意同一件事三次。

It's tripling 三倍；三重的 the strength 力量；强度 of whatever dynamic 动态；机制 you're trying to drill into 深入探讨；强调 at the moment.

[.my2]
它使你当时试图强调的任何机制力量增加两倍。

In doing so, it uncovers 揭示；发现 problems before they happen.

[.my2]
这样做，它在问题发生之前揭示问题。

It's really hard to repeatedly 反复地；重复地 lie or fake conviction 假装确信；装出深信不疑的样子。

[.my2]
反复撒谎或假装确信真的很难。

When I first learned this skill, my biggest fear 恐惧；担忧 was how to avoid sounding like a broken record 唠叨；重复说 and coming off as 显得；给人以…印象 really pushy.

[.my2]
当我第一次学习这个技巧时，我最大的担忧是如何避免听起来像个唠叨鬼或显得非常咄咄逼人。

The answer I learned is to vary your tactics 策略；手段；招数。

[.my2]
我学到的答案是改变你的策略。

The first time they agree to something or give you a commitment, that's number one.

[.my2]
他们第一次同意某事或给你一个承诺，那是第一次。

For number two, you might label or summarize what they said so they answer that's right.

[.my2]
对于第二次，你可能标记或总结他们所说的，以便他们回答“对”。

And number three could be a calibrated how or what question about implementation that asks them to explain what will constitute 构成；组成 success.

[.my2]
第三次可能是一个关于实施的经过校准的“如何”或“什么”问题，要求他们解释什么将构成成功。

Something like what do we do if we get off track? Or the three times might just be the same calibrated question phrased 措辞；表达 three different ways like what's the biggest challenge you faced? What are we up against 面对；对抗 here? What do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around 避开；绕过? Either way, going at the same issue three times uncovers falsehoods 谎言；虚假 as well as the inongruences between words and body language we mentioned in the last section.

[.my2]
像“如果我们脱离正轨，我们该怎么做？”这样的问题。或者三次可能只是同一个经过校准的问题以三种不同方式措辞，比如“你面临的最大挑战是什么？”“我们在这里面对什么？”“你认为最难避开的事情是什么？”无论哪种方式，三次针对同一个问题都会揭示谎言，以及我们在上一节中提到的言语和肢体语言之间的不一致。

So, next time you're not sure your counterpart is truthful 真实的；诚实的 and committed 坚定的；承诺的, try it.

[.my2]
所以，下次当你不确定你的对手是否诚实和坚定时，试试吧。

The Pinocchio effect 皮诺曹效应；匹诺曹效应 with Carlo Coll's famous character Pinocchio, it was easy to tell when he was lying.

[.my2]
皮诺曹效应：卡洛·科洛迪的著名角色匹诺曹，很容易看出他何时撒谎。

You just had to watch the nose.

[.my2]
你只需要看鼻子。

It turns out that colott wasn't far off reality 离现实很远；与事实不符。

[.my2]
事实证明，科洛迪离现实不远。

Most people offer obvious telltale signs 明显的迹象；泄露真相的迹象 when they're lying.

[.my2]
大多数人在撒谎时会提供明显的迹象。

Not a growing nose, but close enough 足够接近；差不多。

[.my2]
不是一个不断增长的鼻子，但足够接近了。

In a study of the components 组成部分；要素 of lying, Harvard Business School professor Deepo Mahaltra and his co-authors 合著者；合作者 found that on average 平均；通常 liars use more words than trutht tellers 讲真话的人；诚实的人 and use far more third person pronouns 第三人称代词。

[.my2]
在一项关于撒谎要素的研究中，哈佛商学院教授迪波·马尔霍特拉和他的合著者发现，平均来说，说谎者使用的词语比诚实的人多，并且使用的第三人称代词多得多。

They start talking about him, her, it, one, they, and their rather than 代替；而不是 I in order to put some distance 保持距离；拉开距离 between themselves and the lie.

[.my2]
他们开始谈论他、她、它、一个人、他们和他们的，而不是“我”，以便在他们自己和谎言之间保持距离。

And they discovered that liars tend to speak in more complex 复杂的；难懂的 sentences 句子；判决 in an attempt to 试图；力图 win over 争取；说服 their suspicious 怀疑的；可疑的 counterparts.

[.my2]
他们发现，说谎者倾向于说更复杂的句子，试图说服他们怀疑的对手。

It's what WC Fields meant when he talked about baffling 使困惑；难倒 someone with The researchers dubbed 称之为；命名为 this the Pinocchio effect because just like Pinocchio's nose, the number of words grew along with the lie.

[.my2]
这就是 WC·菲尔兹在谈论用…使人困惑时所指的意思。研究人员称之为皮诺曹效应，因为就像匹诺曹的鼻子一样，词语的数量随着谎言一起增长。

People who are lying are understandably 可以理解地；情理之中地 more worried about being believed, so they work harder, too hard as it were 可以说；似乎是, at being believable 可信的；可靠的。

[.my2]
说谎的人可以理解地更担心被相信，所以他们更努力，可以说过于努力，让自己显得可信。

Pay attention to their usage of pronouns 代词；人称代词。

[.my2]
关注他们使用代词的情况。

The use of pronouns by a counterpart can also help give you a feel for 感觉；了解 their actual importance 实际重要性；真正的重要性 in the decision and implementation chains 链条；系列。

[.my2]
对手使用代词也可以帮助你了解他们在决策和实施链条中的实际重要性。

on the other side of the table.

[.my2]
在谈判桌的另一边。

The more in love they are with I, me, and my, the less important they are.

[.my2]
他们越喜欢“我”和“我的”，他们就越不重要。

Conversely 相反地；反之, the harder it is to get a first person pronoun 第一人称代词 out of a negotiator's mouth, the more important they are.

[.my2]
相反地，越难从谈判者口中得到第一人称代词，他们就越重要。

Just like in the Malholtra study where the liar is distancing 疏远；拉开距离 himself from the lie, in a negotiation, smart decision makers 聪明的决策者；精明的决策人 don't want to be cornered 被逼入绝境；走投无路 at the table into making a decision.

[.my2]
就像在马尔霍特拉的研究中，说谎者正从谎言中拉开距离一样，在谈判中，聪明的决策者不想在谈判桌上被逼入绝境做出决定。

They will defer to 听从；遵从 the people away from the table to keep from 避免；防止 getting pinned down 被迫表态；被钉住。

[.my2]
他们会听从不在谈判桌前的人，以避免被迫表态。

Our cab driver kidnapper in the Philippines of Alistair Onling Swan used we, they, and them so rigorously 严格地；严厉地 early on in the kidnapping, I was convinced 相信；确信 we were engaged with their leader 领导者；头目。

[.my2]
我们在菲律宾的出租车司机绑匪在绑架早期如此严格地使用“我们”、“他们”和“他们的”，我确信我们正在与他们的头目接触。

I just never knew how literally 确实地；字面上 true it was until the rescue 救援；营救。

[.my2]
我只是直到救援才明白它确实是多么的真实。

In the Chase Manhattan bank robbery from chapter 2, the bank robber 银行抢劫犯；劫匪 Chris Watts consistently 始终如一地；一致地 talked out 说出来；表明 how dangerous 危险的；不安全的 the others were and how little influence 影响；影响力 he had on them.

[.my2]
在第 2 章的大通曼哈顿银行抢劫案中，银行劫匪克里斯·瓦茨始终如一地说出其他人有多危险，以及他对他们有多小的影响。

All a lie.

[.my2]
全是谎言。

The Chris discount 克里斯折扣；克里斯优惠。

[.my2]
克里斯折扣。

People always talk about remembering and using but not overusing 过度使用；滥用 your counterpart's name in a negotiation, and that's important.

[.my2]
人们总是谈论在谈判中记住和使用但不要过度使用你的对手的名字，这很重要。

The reality though is people are often tired of 厌倦；厌烦 being hammered 锤击；反复强调 with their own name.

[.my2]
然而现实是，人们经常厌倦被反复强调自己的名字。

The slick 狡猾的；油滑的 salesman trying to drive them to yes will hit them with it over and over 反复；再三。

[.my2]
狡猾的推销员试图驱使他们同意，会反复地用这个名字攻击他们。

Instead 相反；反而, take a different tack 采取不同的方法；换个方式 and use your own name.

[.my2]
相反，采取一个不同的方法，使用你自己的名字。

That's how I get the Chris discount.

[.my2]
这就是我获得克里斯折扣的方式。

Just as using Alaster's name with the kidnapper and getting him to use it back humanized 使人道化；使人性化 the hostage and made it less likely 可能性较小；不太可能 he would be harmed, using your own name creates the dynamic of forced empathy 强制同理心；被迫同情。

[.my2]
正如对绑匪使用阿拉斯廷的名字并让他反过来使用它使人质人性化，使他不太可能受到伤害一样，使用你自己的名字创造了强制同理心的机制。

It makes the other side see you as a person.

[.my2]
它让对方将你视为一个人。

A few years ago, I was in a bar in Kansas with a bunch of 一群；一伙 fellow FBI negotiators 联邦调查局谈判代表；联邦调查局特工。

[.my2]
几年前，我在堪萨斯的一家酒吧里，和一群联邦调查局谈判代表在一起。

The bar was packed 拥挤的；人满为患的, but I saw one empty chair 空椅子；空座位。

[.my2]
酒吧人满为患，但我看到一个空座位。

I moved toward 走向；朝向 it, but just as I got ready to sit, the guy next to it said, "Don't even think about it." "Why?" I asked, and he said, "Because I'll kick your ass 揍你；打你。" He was big, burly 魁梧的；健壮的, and already drunk 喝醉的；醉酒的。

[.my2]
我走向它，但就在我准备坐下时，旁边的那个人说：“想都别想。”“为什么？”我问，他说：“因为我会揍你的。”他体型高大、魁梧，而且已经喝醉了。

But look, I'm a lifelong 终生的；一辈子的 hostage negotiator.

[.my2]
但是你看，我是一个终生的人质谈判代表。

I gravitate toward 倾向于；被吸引到 tense situations 紧张局势；紧张情况 that need mediation 调解；斡旋 like a moth to the flame 飞蛾扑火；自投罗网。

[.my2]
我被吸引到需要调解的紧张局势中，就像飞蛾扑火一样。

I held out 伸出；递出 my hand to shake his and said, "My name is Chris." The dude froze 冻结；僵住 and in the pause 停顿；间歇 my fellow FBI guys moved in, patted him on the shoulders 拍肩膀；安慰 and offered to buy him a drink.

[.my2]
我伸出手与他握手，说：“我叫克里斯。”那个家伙僵住了，在停顿期间，我的联邦调查局同事们走了过来，拍了拍他的肩膀，提出要请他喝一杯。

Turned out 结果是；原来是 he was a Vietnam veteran 越南老兵；越战退伍军人 at a particularly low point 人生低谷；特别失落的时期。

[.my2]
结果他是一名越南老兵，正处于一个特别失落的时期。

He was in a packed bar where the entire world seemed to be celebrating 庆祝；欢庆。

[.my2]
他在一个人满为患的酒吧里，整个世界似乎都在庆祝。

The only thing he could think of was to fight.

[.my2]
他唯一能想到的就是打架。

But as soon as 一旦；一…就 I became Chris, everything changed.

[.my2]
但一旦我成为克里斯，一切都改变了。

Now take that mindset 心态；思维模式 to a financial negotiation 财务谈判；金融协商。

[.my2]
现在将这种心态带入财务谈判。

I was in an outlet mall 奥特莱斯购物中心；折扣商场 a few months after the Kansas experience and I picked out 挑选；选出 some shirts in one of the stores.

[.my2]
在堪萨斯的经历几个月后，我在一家奥特莱斯购物中心，在其中一家店里挑选了一些衬衫。

At the front counter 前台；柜台, the young lady asked me if I wanted to join their frequent buyer program 忠实买家计划；常客计划。

[.my2]
在前台，那位年轻女士问我是否想加入他们的忠实买家计划。

I asked her if I got a discount for joining and she said no.

[.my2]
我问她加入是否有折扣，她说没有。

So, I decided to try another angle 角度；方法。

[.my2]
所以，我决定尝试另一个方法。

I said in a friendly manner 友好的方式；友善地, "My name is Chris.

[.my2]
我友善地说：“我叫克里斯。

What's the Chris discount?" She looked from the register 收银机；登记簿, met my eyes 对视；眼神接触, and gave a little laugh.

[.my2]
克里斯折扣是什么？”她从收银机上抬起头，与我眼神接触，笑了笑。

I'll have to ask my manager, Kathy," she said, and turned to the woman who'd been standing next to her.

[.my2]
“我得问问我的经理，凯西，”她说，并转向一直站在她旁边的女人。

Kathy, who'd heard the whole exchange 交流；对话, said, "The best I can do is 10%." Hey, my name is Aaron, and I'm here to humanize myself 使自己人性化；展现人性 with your special price 特价；优惠价。

[.my2]
凯西，她听到了整个对话，说：“我能做到的最好是$10\%$折扣。”嘿，我叫亚伦，我来这里是为了用你的特价展现我的人性。

How to get your counterparts to bid against themselves 自己出价反对自己；自己跟自己砍价。

[.my2]
如何让你的对手自己跟自己砍价。

Like you saw Aaron and Julie do with their kidnappers, the best way to get your counterparts to lower their demands is to say no using how questions.

[.my2]
就像你看到亚伦和朱莉对他们的绑匪所做的那样，让你的对手降低要求的最好方法是使用“如何”问题说“不”。

These indirect 间接的；迂回的 ways of saying no won't shut down 使停止；使沉默 your counterpart the way a blunt 直截了当的；生硬的, pride piercing 刺痛自尊；损伤骄傲 no would.

[.my2]
这些间接说“不”的方式不会像一个生硬的、刺痛自尊的“不”那样使你的对手沉默。

In fact, these responses will sound so much like counter bids 反对提议；反向出价 that your counterparts will often keep bidding against themselves.

[.my2]
事实上，这些回应会非常像反向出价，以至于你的对手经常会继续自己跟自己砍价。

We found that you can usually express no four times before actually saying the word.

[.my2]
我们发现，在真正说出这个词之前，你通常可以表达四次“不”。

The first step in the no series 系列；顺序 is the old standby 老方法；老套路。

[.my2]
“不”系列中的第一步是老套路。

How am I supposed to do that? You have to deliver 传达；表达 it in a differential 恭敬的；尊敬的 way.

[.my2]
“我该怎么做？”你必须以恭敬的方式传达它。

So it becomes a request for help 寻求帮助；请求援助。

[.my2]
所以它变成了寻求帮助。

Properly delivered 恰当地表达；正确地传达, it invites 邀请；引出 the other side to participate in 参与；加入 your dilemma 困境；进退两难 and solve it with a better offer 更好的提议；更有利的报价。

[.my2]
如果恰当地传达，它会邀请对方参与你的困境，并用一个更好的提议解决它。

After that, some version of your offer is very generous 慷慨的；大方的。

[.my2]
在那之后，某种版本的“你的提议非常慷慨。

I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for me 不适合我；对我行不通 is an elegant 优雅的；得体的 second way to say no.

[.my2]
抱歉，那对我行不通”是说“不”的第二种优雅方式。

This well-ested 经过充分测试的；经过验证的 response avoids making a counter offer 反对提议；还价, and the use of generous nurtures 培养；促进 your counterpart to live up to 达到；不辜负 the word.

[.my2]
这个经过验证的回应避免了还价，使用“慷慨”一词促进你的对手不辜负这个词。

The I'm sorry also softens 软化；缓和 the no and builds empathy 建立同理心；培养共情。

[.my2]
“抱歉”也软化了“不”，并培养同理心。

You can ignore 忽略；不理会 the so-called 所谓的；号称的 negotiating experts 谈判专家；协商专家 who say apologies 道歉；致歉 are always signs 迹象；标志 of weakness 弱点；弱势。

[.my2]
你可以忽略那些所谓的谈判专家，他们说道歉总是弱势的标志。

Then you can use something like, "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I just can't do that." It's a little more direct 直接的；更坦率的。

[.my2]
然后你可以使用像“抱歉，但我恐怕我就是不能那样做”这样的话。它更直接一些。

And the can't do that does great double duty 双重作用；一石二鸟。

[.my2]
而“不能那样做”起到了很大的双重作用。

By expressing an inability 无法；不能 to perform 履行；执行, it can trigger 触发；引发 the other side's empathy toward 对…的同理心；对…的共情 you.

[.my2]
通过表达无法履行，它可以触发对方对你的同理心。

I'm sorry.

[.my2]
抱歉。

No is a slightly 稍微；略微 more succinct 简洁的；简明的 version 版本；形式 for the fourth no.

[.my2]
“不”是第四次“不”稍微更为简洁的形式。

If delivered gently 表达温和；传递温和, it barely 几乎不；勉强 sounds negative 负面的；消极的 at all.

[.my2]
如果表达温和，它几乎听起来不是负面的。

If you have to go further 更进一步；深入, of course, no is the last and most direct way.

[.my2]
当然，如果你必须更进一步，“不”是最后也是最直接的方式。

Verbally, it should be delivered with a downward inflection 语调下降；降调 and a tone of regard 尊重；敬意。

[.my2]
口头上，它应该以降调和尊重的语气传达。

It's not meant to be 并非旨在；不是为了 no.

[.my2]
它并非旨在成为一个“不”。

One of my students, a guy named Jesus Bueno, wrote me not long ago 不久前；前段时间 to tell me an amazing 令人惊叹的；了不起的 story about how he'd used the multi-step no 多步骤“不”；多层次拒绝 to help his brother Waqin out of a sticky 棘手的；困难的 business situation 商业困境；商业情况。

[.my2]
我的一个学生，一个叫赫苏斯·布埃诺的人，不久前写信给我，告诉我一个令人惊叹的故事，关于他如何使用多步骤“不”来帮助他的兄弟瓦金摆脱一个棘手的商业困境。

His brother and two friends had bought a cannabis 大麻；大麻属植物 grow shop franchise 种植店特许经营权；种植店加盟店 in northern Spain where the cultivation 种植；耕种 of marijuana 大麻；大麻叶 for personal use 个人使用；私人用途 is legal 合法的；法律允许的。

[.my2]
他的兄弟和两个朋友在西班牙北部买了一个大麻种植店特许经营权，那里种植大麻供个人使用是合法的。

Ween and his partner Bruno each invested 投资；投入 $20,000$ in the business for a $46\%$ stake 股份；股权。

[.my2]
瓦金和他的伙伴布鲁诺每人投资了 20,000 欧元在这项业务中，占有$46\%$的股份。

A minority partner 少数股东；小股东 invested another $3500$ for $8\%$.

[.my2]
一位少数股东又投资了 3,500 欧元，占有$8\%$。

From the beginning, Waqin and Bruno had a rocky relationship 不稳定的关系；动荡的关系。

[.my2]
从一开始，瓦金和布鲁诺的关系就不稳定。

We is an excellent salesman while Bruno was more of a bookkeeper 簿记员；会计。

[.my2]
瓦金是一位出色的推销员，而布鲁诺更像一个会计。

The minority partner 少数股东；小股东 was also an excellent salesman and he and Waqen believed that growing sales was the correct strategy 策略；方针。

[.my2]
少数股东也是一个出色的推销员，他和瓦金相信增加销售是正确的策略。

That meant offering discounts 打折；折扣 for large orders 大订单；大量订购 and repeat customers 重复购买的客户；老顾客 which Bruno disagreed with.

[.my2]
这意味着为大订单和老顾客提供折扣，这是布鲁诺不赞同的。

Their plan spending on launching 启动；推出 a website and expanding 扩大；扩展 inventory 库存；存货 also rubbed Bruno the wrong way 惹恼布鲁诺；触怒布鲁诺。

[.my2]
他们计划在推出一个网站和扩大库存上的支出也惹恼了布鲁诺。

Then Bruno's wife became a problem as she started nagging 唠叨；喋喋不休 Waqin about how he should not spend so much on expansion 扩张；扩大 and instead take more profits 利润；收益。

[.my2]
然后布鲁诺的妻子成了一个问题，因为她开始唠叨瓦金不应该在扩张上花那么多钱，而应该获得更多利润。

One day we was reviewing 审查；检查 inventory purchases 采购；购买 and noticed that some items 物品；项目 they had ordered had not been placed on the store shelves 货架；架子。

[.my2]
一天，瓦金正在审查库存采购，注意到他们订购的一些物品没有被放在商店的货架上。

He began searching for them online.

[.my2]
他开始在网上搜索它们。

And to his surprise 惊讶；出乎意料, he found an eBay store set up 建立；设立 with the wife's first name that was selling exactly those missing 丢失的；不见的 products.

[.my2]
令他惊讶的是，他发现了一个以妻子的名字建立的eBay 商店，正在出售正是那些丢失的产品。

This started a huge argument 争论；争吵 between Bruno and Waqin and soured 恶化；变糟 their relationship 关系；人际关系。

[.my2]
这引发了布鲁诺和瓦金之间的一场大争论，并恶化了他们的关系。

In the heat of the moment 在冲动之下；一时激动, Bruno told Waqin that he was open to 愿意；接受 selling his shares 股份；份额 because he felt the business risks 商业风险；经营风险 they were taking were too large.

[.my2]
一时激动，布鲁诺告诉瓦金，他愿意出售他的股份，因为他觉得他们正在承担的商业风险太大了。

So, Waqen consulted with 咨询；请教 his brother, my student Jesus.

[.my2]
所以，瓦金咨询了他的兄弟，我的学生赫苏斯。

Because they believed that pressure from Bruno's wife was why he wanted to sell, Jesus helped craft 制定；精心制作 an empathy message 同理心信息；共情信息 around that.

[.my2]
因为他们相信来自布鲁诺妻子的压力是他想出售的原因，赫苏斯帮助围绕这一点制定了一个同理心信息。

It seems like you were under a lot of pressure 承受很大压力；压力很大 from your wife.

[.my2]
“你看起来来自你妻子的压力很大。”

We was also in the middle of 在…过程中；正处于 a divorce 离婚；婚姻破裂。

[.my2]
瓦金也正处于离婚的过程中。

So, they decided to use that to relate to 与…产生共鸣；理解 the wife issues and they prepared an accusation audit 指控审计；指责清单。

[.my2]
所以，他们决定利用这一点来理解（布鲁诺）妻子的问题，他们准备了一份指控审计。

I know you think I don't care about costs and taking profits from the company in order to diffuse 减轻；消除 the negative energy 负面情绪；消极能量 and get Bruno talking.

[.my2]
“我知道你认为我不关心成本，也不关心从公司获取利润。”以消除负面情绪并让布鲁诺开口。

It worked like a charm 奏效；效果极好。

[.my2]
它效果极好。

Bruno immediately agreed with the accusation audit and began explaining why he thought we was careless 粗心的；不小心的 with spending.

[.my2]
布鲁诺立即同意了指控审计，并开始解释为什么他认为瓦金在支出上很粗心。

Bruno also noted 指出；提到 that he didn't have someone to bail him out 救他脱困；帮他摆脱困境 like we did.

[.my2]
布鲁诺还指出，他没有人像瓦金那样救他脱困。

We got a startup loan 创业贷款；启动资金 from his mother.

[.my2]
瓦金从他母亲那里获得了一笔创业贷款。

We used mirrors 镜像；重复 and he did.

[.my2]
瓦金使用镜像（重复布鲁诺所说的话），让布鲁诺继续说话，他确实这样做了。

Finally, we said, "I know how the pressure from your wife can feel.

[.my2]
最后，瓦金说：“我知道来自你妻子的压力是什么感觉。

I'm going through a divorce myself and it really takes a lot out of you 使人筋疲力尽；耗费精力." Bruno then went on a 10-minute rant 咆哮；大骂 about his wife and let slip 无意中说出；泄露 a huge piece of information 重大信息；重要情报。

[.my2]
我自己也正在经历离婚，那真的很耗费精力。”布鲁诺随后大骂了他的妻子 10 分钟，并无意中泄露了一个重大信息。

[.my2]
全额偿还贷款，或者支付一个高得多的利率。

Bingo 猜中了；说对了。

[.my2]
说对了。

Waqin and Jesus huddled 聚集；商议 after learning that and decided that we could reasonably pay 合理支付；出价合理 just above the loan price because Bruno had already taken $14,000$ in salary 薪水；工资 from the business.

[.my2]
瓦金和赫苏斯在得知这一点后聚集商议，并决定瓦金可以合理地支付略高于贷款的价格，因为布鲁诺已经从业务中拿了 14,000 欧元的薪水。

The letter from the bank put Bruno in a bad spot 处于困境；陷入不利境地 and Waqen figured 认为；估计 he could bid low 出价低；低价竞标 because there wasn't really a market for Bruno to sell his shares 股份；份额。

[.my2]
银行的信件使布鲁诺处于不利境地，瓦金估计他可以低价竞标，因为布鲁诺出售他的股份并没有真正的市场。

They decided that $23,000$ would be the magic number 理想数字；神奇数字 with $11,000$ upfront 预先；事先 with the remaining 剩余的；剩下的 $12,000$ over a year period 一年时间；一年内。

[.my2]
他们决定 $23,000$ 欧元将是理想数字，其中 $11,000$ 欧元预先支付，剩余的 $12,000$ 欧元在一年内支付。

Then things went sideways 出了岔子；横向发展。

[.my2]
然后事情出了岔子。

Instead of waiting for Bruno to name a price, we jumped the gun 操之过急；抢先一步 and made his full offer, telling Bruno that he thought it was very fair 公平的；合理的。

[.my2]
瓦金没有等布鲁诺开价，而是操之过急，开出了他的全部报价，告诉布鲁诺他认为这非常合理。

If there's one way to put off 使反感；推迟 your counterpart, it's by implying 暗示；意味 that disagreeing with you is unfair.

[.my2]
如果有一种方法让你的对手感到反感，那就是暗示不同意你是不公平的。

[.my2]
接下来发生的事情证明了这一点：布鲁诺生气地挂断了电话，两天后瓦金收到了一封电子邮件，来自一个声称被雇来代表布鲁诺的人。

They wanted $30,812$.

[.my2]
他们要求 $30,812$ 欧元。

$20,000$ for the loan, $4,000$ for salary, $6,230$ for equity 股权；资产净值, and $582$ for interest 利息；兴趣。

[.my2]
$20,000$ 欧元用于贷款，$4,000$ 欧元用于薪水，$6,230$ 欧元用于股权，$582$ 欧元用于利息。

非整齐的数字，在它们的具体性方面似乎不可改变。

This guy was a pro 专业人士；行家。

[.my2]
这个家伙是个行家。

Jesus told that he'd truly screwed up 搞砸了；弄糟了。

[.my2]
赫苏斯告诉瓦金，他真的搞砸了。

But they both knew that Bruno was pretty desperate 绝望的；不顾一切的 to sell.

[.my2]
但他们都知道布鲁诺非常急于出售。

So they decided to use the multi-step no strategy 策略；方针 to get Bruno to bid against himself.

[.my2]
所以他们决定使用多步骤拒绝策略来让布鲁诺自己跟自己砍价。

The worst case scenario 最坏的情况；最糟的局面, they decided was that Bruno would just change his mind 改变主意；回心转意 about selling his shares and the status quo 现状；目前的状况 would continue.

[.my2]
他们决定最坏的情况是布鲁诺只会改变出售他股份的主意，现状将继续下去。

It was a risk 风险；危险 they'd have to take.

[.my2]
这是他们必须承担的风险。

They crafted 制定；精心制作 their first no message 信息；口信。

[.my2]
他们制定了他们的第一个拒绝信息。

The price you offered is very fair and I certainly wish that I could afford 负担得起；买得起 it.

[.my2]

[.my2]
我非常抱歉，但祝你万事如意。”

Notice how they made no counter offer and said no without using the word.

[.my2]
注意他们如何没有还价，并且在不使用“不”这个词的情况下说了“不”。

Waqin was shocked 震惊的；吃惊的 when the following day 次日；第二天 he received an email from the adviser 顾问；参谋 lowering 降低；减低 the price to $28,346$.

[.my2]
次日，当他收到来自顾问将价格降低到 $28,346$ 欧元的电子邮件时，瓦金感到震惊。

Walken and Jesus then crafted their second gentle 温和的；轻柔的 no.

[.my2]
瓦金和赫苏斯随后制定了他们的第二个温和的“不”。

Thank you for your offer.

[.my2]
“感谢你的报价。

You were generous to reduce 减少；降低 the price which I greatly appreciate.

[.my2]
你很慷慨地降低了价格，我非常感激。

I really wish that I could pay you this amount but I am sincere 真诚的；诚恳的 in that I cannot afford this amount at this time.

[.my2]
我真的希望我能支付这个金额，但我真诚地表示我目前负担不起这个金额。

As you know, I am in the middle of a divorce and I just cannot come up with 筹集；想出 that type of money.

[.my2]
正如你所知，我正处于离婚的过程中，我就是无法筹集那种钱。

Again, I wish you the best of luck.

第二天，瓦金收到了来自顾问的一行邮件，将价格降至 $25,000$ 欧元。

Guarantee execution. + 

During a dangerous and chaotic prison siege in St. + 

Martin Parish, Louisiana, a few years ago, a group of inmates armed with makeshift knives took the warden and some of his staff hostage. + 

The situation was especially nervy because the prisoners were both tense and disorganized. + 

a worrisome mix that meant anything could happen. + 

The negotiators sensed that beneath the bluster, the prisoners didn't really want to hurt the staff. + 

They knew that they felt backed into a corner, and more than anything, they wanted the situation to end. + 

But there was a stumbling block. + 

The inmates were afraid that the prisoners who gave up after taking correctional officers hostage, not to mention the warden, would end up beaten and badly. + 

So, the negotiators delivered a pair of walkie-talkies to the inmates and designed this elaborate surrender ritual to get the hostage takers to end the siege. + 

The idea was elegantly simple. + 

The inmates would send out one of their guys with a walkie-talkie, and he'd walk past the three perimeters of combined multi- agency law enforcement that were stationed outside the prison. + 

Once he'd walked past the final perimeter, he'd get into the patty wagon and be transferred to jail. + 

there. + 

He'd use the walkie-talkie to call the guys back in the prison and say essentially they didn't kick my ass. + 

And they'd know it was okay to come out just like he did one at a time. + 

After some haggling, the inmates agreed with the plan and the first inmate comes out. + 

It starts off great. + 

He walks past the federal zone, then the SWAT zone, and then he makes it to the outer perimeter. + 

But just as he's about to climb into the patty wagon, some guy sees the walkie-talkie and says, "What the hell are you doing with that?" and confiscates it before sending the guy off to the jail. + 

The inmates back in the prison start to freak out because their buddy hasn't called. + 

The one with the other walkie-talkie calls the negotiators and starts yelling, "Why didn't he call? They're kicking his ass. + 

We told you." He starts talking about cutting off a hostage's finger just to make sure the negotiators know the inmates are for real. + 

Now it's the negotiators who are freaking out. + 

They sprint to the perimeter and start screaming at everyone. + 

It's life and death at stake or at least an amputated finger. + 

Finally, 15 nailbiting minutes later, this SWAT guy comes striding up all proud of himself. + 

Some idiot gave this dude a radio, he says. + 

and sort of smiles as he hands the negotiators the walkie-talkie. + 

The negotiators barely stop themselves from slugging the guy before they tear off to the jail to have the first inmate call in. + 

Crisis averted, but barely. + 

The point here is that your job as a negotiator isn't just to get to an agreement. + 

It's getting to one that can be implemented and making sure that happens. + 

Negotiators have to be decision architects. + 

They have to dynamically and adaptively design the verbal and non-verbal elements of the negotiation to gain both consent and execution. + 

Yes is nothing without how. + 

While an agreement is nice, a contract is better and a signed check is best. + 

You don't get your profits with the agreement. + 

They come upon implementation. + 

Success isn't the hostage taker saying, "Yes, we have a deal." Success comes afterward when the freed hostage says to your face, "Thank you." In this chapter, I'll show how to drive toward and achieve consent both with those at the negotiating table and with the invisible forces underneath it. + 

Distinguish true buyin from fake acquiescence and guarantee execution using the rule of three. + 

Yes is nothing without how. + 

About a year after the Doss Palmus crisis, I was teaching at the FBI Academy in Quantico when the bureau got an urgent call from the State Department. + 

An American had been kidnapped in the Ecuadorian jungle by a Colombia based rebel group. + 

As the FBI's lead international hostage negotiator, this was my baby. + 

So, I put a team together and set up Operation Headquarters in Quantico. + 

For a few years, Jose and his wife Julie had been guiding tour groups through the jungle near the Colombian border. + 

Born in Ecuador, Jose had become an American citizen and was working as a paramedic in New York City when he and Julie decided to set up an ecoourism business in his native country. + 

Jose loved the Ecuadorian jungle and he'd long dreamed of teaching visitors about the monkeys that swung through the trees and the flowers that perfumed the trails. + 

The business grew as ecoourrists fell for the pair's obvious passion. + 

And on August 20, 2003, Jose and Julie took 11 people on a whitewater rafting trip down the Mera River. + 

After a great day on the water, everyone was smiling and soaked as they piled into jeeps and pickups for the ride to an inn in a nearby village. + 

Jose told tall tales as he drove the lead truck, Julie to his right with their 11-month-old baby in her lap. + 

They were 5 minutes from the inn when three men jumped into the road and aimed guns at the truck. + 

A fourth man emerged and held a revolver to Julie's head as the thugs pulled Jose from the car and forced him into the truck bed. + 

The kidnappers then ordered the caravan through several small towns to a fork in the road where they got out and walked Jose past Julie's seat in the cab. + 

"Just remember," Julie said. + 

"No matter what happens, I love you. + 

Don't worry, I'll be fine," Jose answered. + 

And then he and his capttors disappeared into the jungle. + 

The captors wanted $5 million. + 

We wanted to buy time. + 

Ever since the Dose Palma's debacle and the Pittsburgh epiphany, I had been raring to employ the lessons we'd learned about calibrated questions. + 

So when Jose was kidnapped, I sent my guys down to Ecuador and told them that we had a new strategy. + 

The kidnapping would provide an opportunity to prove this approach. + 

All we're going to say is, "Hey, how do we know Jose is okay? How are we supposed to pay until we know Jose is okay?" Again and again, I told them, although they were queasy about untested techniques, my guys were game. + 

The local cops were livid, though, because they always did proof of life the old-fashioned way, which the FBI had taught them in the first place. + 

Luckily, Julie was with us 100% because she saw how the calibrated questions would stall for time. + 

And she was convinced that with enough time, her husband would find a way to get home. + 

The day after the kidnapping, the rebels marched Jose into the mountains along the Colombian border and settled in a cabin high in the jungle. + 

There, Jose built a rapport with the kidnappers to make himself harder for them to kill. + 

He impressed them with his knowledge of the jungle. + 

And with a black belt in karate, he filled the time by teaching them martial arts. + 

My negotiators coached Julie every day as we waited for contact from the rebels. + 

We learned later that the designated negotiator from Jose's captors had to walk to town to negotiate by phone. + 

My guys told Julie to answer every one of the kidnappers demands with a question. + 

My strategy was to keep the kidnappers engaged, but offbalance. + 

"How do I know Jose is alive?" she asked the first time they talked. + 

"To their demand for $5 million," she said. + 

"We don't have that kind of money. + 

How can we raise that much? How can we pay you anything until we know Jose is okay?" Julie asked the next time they talked. + 

questions. + 

Always questions. + 

The kidnapper who was negotiating with Julie seemed extremely perplexed by her persistent questions and he kept asking for time to think. + 

That slowed everything down, but he never got angry with Julie. + 

Answering questions gave him the illusion that he had control of the negotiation. + 

By constantly asking questions and making minuscule offers, Julie drove the ransom down to $16,500. + 

When they came to that number, the kidnappers demanded she get it to them immediately. + 

"How can I do that when I have to sell my cars and trucks?" she asked, always buying more time. + 

We were starting to grin because success was within reach. + 

We were really close to a ransom that the family could afford. + 

And then I got a phone call in the middle of the night from one of my deployed guys in Ecuador, Kevin Rust. + 

Kevin is a terrific negotiator and the same guy who'd called to tell me a year earlier that Martin Burnham had been killed. + 

My stomach tied into a knot when I heard his voice. + 

We just got a call from Jose. + 

Kevin said he's still in guerilla territory, but he escaped and he's on a bus and he's making his way out. + 

It took me half a minute to respond. + 

And when I did, all I could say was, "Holy that's fantastic news." What had happened, we learned later, was that with all the delays and questions, some of the gorillas peeled off and didn't return. + 

Pretty soon, there was only one teenager guarding Jose at night. + 

He saw an opening late one evening when it began to chuck down rain. + 

Pounding on the metal roof, the rain drowned out all other sound as the lone guard slept. + 

Knowing the wet leaves outside would absorb the sound of his footsteps, Jose climbed through the window, ran down jungle paths to a dirt road, and worked his way to a small town. + 

2 days later, he was back with Julie and their baby just a few days before his daughter's first birthday. + 

Julie was right. + 

With enough time, he had found a way home. + 

Calibrated how questions are a surefire way to keep negotiations going. + 

They put the pressure on your counterpart to come up with answers and to contemplate your problems when making their demands. + 

With enough of the right how questions, you can read and shape the negotiating environment in such a way that you'll eventually get to the answer you want to hear. + 

You just have to have an idea of where you want the conversation to go when you're devising your questions. + 

The trick to how questions is that correctly used, they are gentle and graceful ways to say no and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution, your solution. + 

A gentle how/no invites collaboration and leaves your counterpart with a feeling of having been treated with respect. + 

Look back at what Julie did when the Colombian rebel kidnappers made their first demands. + 

How can we raise that much? She asked. + 

Notice that she did not use the word no, but she still managed to elegantly deny the kidnapper's $5 million demand as Julie did. + 

The first and most common no question you'll use is some version of how am I supposed to do that? For example, how can we raise that much? Your tone of voice is critical as this phrase can be delivered as either an accusation or a request for assistance. + 

So, pay attention to your voice. + 

This question tends to have the positive effect of making the other side take a good look at your situation. + 

This positive dynamic is what I refer to as forced empathy. + 

And it's especially effective if leading up to it, you've already been empathetic with your counterpart. + 

This engages the dynamic of reciprocity to lead them to do something for you. + 

Starting with Jose's kidnapping, how am I supposed to do that became our primary response to a kidnapper demanding a ransom and we never had it backfire. + 

Once I was working with an accounting consultant named Kelly who was owed a pile of money by a corporate client. + 

She kept consulting because she believed she was developing a useful contact and because the promise of a future payday seemed to justify continuing in good faith. + 

But at a certain point, Kelly was so far behind on her own bills that she was in a bind. + 

She couldn't continue to work with only a vague idea of when she'd get paid, but she worried that if she pushed too hard, she wouldn't get paid at all. + 

I told her to wait until the client asked for more work because if she made a firm payment demand right away, she would be vulnerable if they refused. + 

Luckily for Kelly, the client soon called to ask her for more work. + 

Once he finished his request, she calmly asked a how question. + 

I'd love to help, she said, but how am I supposed to do that? By indicating her willingness to work, but asking for help finding a way to do so, she left her deadbeat customer with no choice but to put her needs ahead of everything else, and she got paid. + 

Besides saying no, the other key benefit of asking how is quite literally that it forces your counterpart to consider and explain how a deal will be implemented. + 

A deal is nothing without good implementation. + 

Poor implementation is the cancer that eats your profits. + 

By making your counterparts articulate implementation in their own words, your carefully calibrated how questions will convince them that the final solution is their idea. + 

And that's crucial. + 

People always make more effort to implement a solution when they think it's theirs. + 

That is simply human nature. + 

That's why negotiation is often called the art of letting someone else have your way. + 

There are two key questions you can ask to push your counterparts to think they are defining success their way. + 

How will we know we're on track? And how will we address things if we find we're off track? When they answer, you summarize their answers until you get that's right. + 

Then you'll know they've bought in. + 

On the flip side, be wary of two telling signs that your counterpart doesn't believe the idea is theirs. + 

As I've noted, when they say, "You're right," it's often a good indicator they are not vested in what is being discussed. + 

And when you push for implementation and they say, "I'll try," you should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. + 

Because this really means, "I plan to fail." When you hear either of these, dive back in with calibrated how questions until they define the terms of successful implementation in their own voice. + 

Follow up by summarizing what they have said to get a that's right. + 

Let the other side feel victory. + 

Let them think it was their idea. + 

Subsume your ego. + 

Remember yes is nothing without how. + 

So keep asking how and succeed influencing those behind the table. + 

A few weeks after Jose got back to the United States, I drove to his family's place in upstate New York. + 

I was thrilled when Jose escaped, but the case left me with one nagging worry. + 

Had my new strategy failed? You see, Jose had gotten home safely, but not because we'd negotiated his release. + 

I worried that our winning had less to do with our brilliant strategy than with dumb luck. + 

After being greeted warmly by Julie and her parents, Jose and I grabbed some coffee and sat down. + 

I'd gone there to do what CNU referred to as a hostage survival debriefing. + 

I was after insights into how to better advise people facing potential kidnappings how best to survive, not just physically, but psychologically. + 

I was also burning to find out what had occurred behind the scenes because it seemed as if my new strategy hadn't worked. + 

Finally, the conversation came around to our use of calibrated questions. + 

You know what? He said the craziest thing was that their negotiator was supposed to stay in town and negotiate the deal. + 

But because Julie kept asking him questions he didn't really know for sure how to answer, he kept coming out to the jungle. + 

They all would get together and have a huge discussion about how to respond. + 

They even thought about taking me into town and putting me on the phone because Julie was so persistent with asking how did she know if I was okay. + 

Right then, I knew we had the right tool. + 

It was exactly the opposite of the Burnham case where our negotiator cut the deal with one of the guys and then the rest of them took the $300,000 and said, "No, we're not doing that." Causing the other side to work that hard and forcing that much internal coordination in service of our own goals was unprecedented. + 

Our negotiating strategy in Ecuador worked not just because the questions contributed to the environment that let Jose escape, but because they made sure the kidnappers, our counterparts, were all on the same page. + 

Yes, few hostage takers and few business dealmakers fly solo. + 

But for the most part, there are almost always other players, people who can act as dealmakers or deal killers. + 

If you truly want to get to yes and get your deal implemented, you have to discover how to affect these individuals. + 

When implementation happens by committee, the support of that committee is key. + 

You always have to identify and unearth their motivations, even if you haven't yet identified each individual on that committee. + 

That can be easy as asking a few calibrated questions like, "How does this affect the rest of your team?" or how on board are the people not on this call or simply what do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area. + 

The larger concept I'm explaining here is that in any negotiation you have to analyze the entire negotiation space when other people will be affected by what is negotiated and can assert their rights or power later on. + 

It's just stupid to consider only the interests of those at the negotiation table. + 

You have to beware of behind the table or level two players. + 

That is parties that are not directly involved but who can help implement agreements they like and block ones they don't. + 

You can't disregard them. + 

Even when you're talking to a CEO, there could always be someone whispering into his ear. + 

At the end of the day, the deal killers often are more important than the deal makers. + 

Think back to the prison siege. + 

It was almost ruined because one bit player on our side was not totally on board. + 

That's what our use of calibrated questions in Ecuador avoided. + 

And that's why Jose's case was a home run. + 

It only takes one bit player to screw up a deal. + 

A few years into private practice, I'd lost sight of the importance of assessing and influencing the hidden negotiation that happens behind the table, and I paid a substantial price. + 

We were closing a deal with a big company in Florida that wanted negotiation training for one of its divisions. + 

We'd been on the phone a bunch of times with the CEO and the head of HR, and they were both 100% gung-ho on our offering. + 

We were elated. + 

We had what we thought was total buyin from the top decision makers for an incredibly lucrative deal. + 

And then, as we were figuring out the small print, the deal fell off the table. + 

It turns out that the head of the division that needed the training killed the deal. + 

Maybe this guy felt threatened, slighted, or otherwise somehow personally injured by the notion that he and his people needed any training at all. + 

A surprisingly high percentage of negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents, often having more to do with self-esteem, status, and other non-financial needs. + 

We'll never know now. + 

The point is, we didn't care until too late because we convinced ourselves that we were on the phone with the only decision makers that mattered. + 

We could have avoided all that had we asked a few calibrated questions like, "How does this affect everybody else? How on board is the rest of your team? How do we make sure that we deliver the right material to the right people? How do we ensure the managers of those we're training are fully on board?" If we had asked questions like that, the CEO and HR head would have checked with this guy, maybe even brought him into the conversation and saved us all a lot of pain. + 

Spotting liars, dealing with jerks, and charming everyone else. + 

As a negotiator, you're going to run into guys who lie to your face and try to scare you into agreement. + 

Aggressive jerks and serial fabricators come with the territory and dealing with them is something you have to do. + 

But learning how to handle aggression and identify falsehood is just part of a larger issue. + 

That is learning how to spot and interpret the subtleties of communication both verbal and non-verbal that reveal the mental states of your counterparts. + 

Truly effective negotiators are conscious of the verbal, paravverbal, how it's said, and non-verbal communications that pervade negotiations and group dynamics. + 

And they know how to employ those subtleties to their benefit. + 

Even changing a single word when you present options like using not lose instead of keep unconsciously influence the conscious choices your counterpart makes. + 

Here, I want to talk about the tools you need to ID liars, disarm jerks, and charm everybody else. + 

Of course, the open-ended how question is one of them, maybe the most important one, but there are many more. + 

Alasting was living in the Philippines when one evening in 2004, he hailed a taxi and settled in for a long ride home from Manila's Greenhill Shopping Center. + 

He dozed off and he woke up in chains. + 

Unfortunately for Alaster, the cabbie had a second business as a kidnapper. + 

He kept a bottle of ether in his front seat, and when a target fell asleep, he would drug him, imprison him, and ask for ransom. + 

Within hours, the kidnapper used Alistair's phone to contact his girlfriend in New York. + 

He demanded a daily payment to take care of Alistair while he researched the family's wealth. + 

"It's okay if you don't pay," he said. + 

I can always sell his organs in Saudi Arabia. + 

Within 24 hours, I'd been charged with heading the negotiation from Quantico. + 

Alistair's girlfriend was too nervous to handle the family side of the negotiation. + 

And his mother, who lived in the Philippines, just wanted to accept any demand the kidnapper made. + 

But Alistair's brother, Aaron, in Manila, was different. + 

He just got the idea of negotiation and he accepted that Alistair might die which would make him a better and more effective negotiator. + 

Aaron and I set up an always on phone line and I became Aaron's guru on the other side of the world. + 

Through the kidnapper's comments and demands, I saw that he was experienced and patient. + 

As a token of his intentions, he offered to cut off one of Alaster's ears and send it to the family along with a video of him severing the ear. + 

The demand for the daily payment was clearly a trick to quickly drain the family of as much money as possible while at the same time gauging their wealth. + 

We had to figure out who this guy was. + 

Was he a lone operator or part of a group? Did he plan on killing Alaster or not? And we had to do that before the family went broke. + 

To get there, we were going to have to engage the kidnapper in a protracted negotiation. + 

We were going to have to slow everything down. + 

From Quantico, I loaded Aaron up with calibrated questions. + 

I instructed him to keep peppering the violent jerk with how. + 

How am I supposed to? How do we know? How can we? There is great power in treating jerks with deference. + 

It gives you the ability to be extremely assertive to say no in a hidden fashion. + 

How do we know if we pay you that you won't hurt alaster? Aaron asked. + 

In the Chinese martial art of Tai Chi, the goal is to use your opponent's aggressiveness against him to turn his offense into your way to defeat him. + 

That's the approach we took with Elasters's kidnapper. + 

We wanted to absorb his threats and wear him down. + 

We made sure that even scheduling a call with us was complex. + 

We delayed making email responses. + 

Through all these tactics, we gained the upper hand while giving the kidnapper the illusion of control. + 

He thought he was solving Aaron's problems while we were just reading him and wasting his time. + 

You see, it's best not to go chin- to chin with aggressiveness like that of a laster's kidnapper. + 

Rather, default to using what and how questions to avoid making bids or adjusting your own negotiating position. + 

Dodge and weave. + 

Finally, following days of back and forth bargaining on the daily rate, Aaron got the kidnapper down to a token amount and agreed to deposit a portion of the funds in his bank account. + 

After that partial payment was made, Aaron came up with the perfect way to non-confrontationally confront the cabbie with a calibrated when what question. + 

"When we run out of money, what will happen?" Aaron asked. + 

The kidnapper paused. + 

"It will be all right," he finally responded. + 

"Yes, without realizing what he had just agreed to, our killer had just promised us he wouldn't hurt Alistair." A repetitive series of what and how questions can help you overcome the aggressive tactics of a manipulative adversary. + 

As you can see in that last exchange, the kidnapper's protracted chats with Aaron had turned Aaron almost into a friend. + 

Over time, the kidnapper had become unguarded about spending time on the phone with his friend. + 

Finally, the Philippine National Police investigators tracked the phone to a house and raided it. + 

The kidnapper and Alistair were not there, but the kidnapper's wife was. + 

She told the police about another house they owned. + 

The police quickly raided the other house, freed Alistair, and arrested the kidnapper. + 

There are plenty of other tactics, tools, and methods for using subtle verbal and non-verbal forms of communication to understand and modify the mental states of your counterpart. + 

As I run through some of them here, I want you to take a moment to internalize each one. + 

These are the kind of tools that can help observant negotiators hit home runs. + 

The 7 3855% rule. + 

In two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike somebody, one UCLA psychology professor Albert Morabian created the 73855 rule. + 

That is only 7% of a message is based on the words while 38% comes from the tone of voice and 55% from the speaker's body language and face. + 

While these figures mainly relate to situations where we are forming an attitude about somebody, the rule nonetheless offers a useful ratio for negotiators. + 

You see, body language and tone of voice, not words, are our most powerful assessment tools. + 

That's why I'll often fly great distances to meet someone face to face, even when I can say much of what needs to be said over the phone. + 

So, how do you use this rule? First, pay very close attention to tone and body language to make sure they match up with the literal meaning of the words. + 

If they don't align, it's quite possible that the speaker is lying or at least unconvinced. + 

When someone's tone of voice or body language does not align with the meaning of the words they say, use labels to discover the source of the inongruence. + 

Here's an example. + 

You so we're agreed them. + 

Yes. + 

I heard you say yes, but it seemed like there was hesitation in your voice. + 

Oh, it's nothing really. + 

No, this is important. + 

Let's make sure we get this right. + 

Thanks. + 

I appreciate it. + 

This is the way to make sure your agreement gets implemented with no surprises and your counterpart will be grateful. + 

Your act of recognizing the inongruence and gently dealing with it through a label will make them feel respected. + 

Consequently, your relationship of trust will be improved. + 

The rule of three. + 

I'm positive that sometime in your life, you've been involved in a negotiation where you got a yes that later turned out to be a no. + 

Maybe the other party was lying to you, or maybe they were just engaged in wishful thinking. + 

Either way, this is not an uncommon experience. + 

This happens because there are actually three kinds of yes: commitment, confirmation, and counterfeit. + 

As we discussed in chapter 5, so many pushy salesmen try to trap their clients into the commitment yes that many people get very good at the counterfeit yes. + 

One great tool for avoiding this trap is the rule of three. + 

The rule of three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. + 

It's tripling the strength of whatever dynamic you're trying to drill into at the moment. + 

In doing so, it uncovers problems before they happen. + 

It's really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction. + 

When I first learned this skill, my biggest fear was how to avoid sounding like a broken record or coming off as really pushy. + 

The answer I learned is to vary your tactics. + 

The first time they agree to something or give you a commitment, that's number one. + 

For number two, you might label or summarize what they said so they answer that's right. + 

And number three could be a calibrated how or what question about implementation that asks them to explain what will constitute success. + 

Something like what do we do if we get off track? Or the three times might just be the same calibrated question phrased three different ways like what's the biggest challenge you faced? What are we up against here? What do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around? Either way, going at the same issue three times uncovers falsehoods as well as the inongruences between words and body language we mentioned in the last section. + 

So, next time you're not sure your counterpart is truthful and committed, try it. + 

The Pinocchio effect with Carlo Coll's famous character Pinocchio, it was easy to tell when he was lying. + 

You just had to watch the nose. + 

It turns out that colott wasn't far off reality. + 

Most people offer obvious telltale signs when they're lying. + 

Not a growing nose, but close enough. + 

In a study of the components of lying, Harvard Business School professor Deepo Mahaltra and his co-authors found that on average liars use more words than trutht tellers and use far more third person pronouns. + 

They start talking about him, her, it, one, they, and their rather than I in order to put some distance between themselves and the lie. + 

And they discovered that liars tend to speak in more complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious counterparts. + 

It's what WC Fields meant when he talked about baffling someone with The researchers dubbed this the Pinocchio effect because just like Pinocchio's nose, the number of words grew along with the lie. + 

People who are lying are understandably more worried about being believed, so they work harder, too hard as it were, at being believable. + 

Pay attention to their usage of pronouns. + 

The use of pronouns by a counterpart can also help give you a feel for their actual importance in the decision and implementation chains. + 

on the other side of the table. + 

The more in love they are with I, me, and my, the less important they are. + 

Conversely, the harder it is to get a first person pronoun out of a negotiator's mouth, the more important they are. + 

Just like in the Malholtra study where the liar is distancing himself from the lie, in a negotiation, smart decision makers don't want to be cornered at the table into making a decision. + 

They will defer to the people away from the table to keep from getting pinned down. + 

Our cab driver kidnapper in the Philippines of Alistair Onling Swan used we, they, and them so rigorously early on in the kidnapping, I was convinced we were engaged with their leader. + 

I just never knew how literally true it was until the rescue. + 

In the Chase Manhattan bank robbery from chapter 2, the bank robber Chris Watts consistently talked out how dangerous the others were and how little influence he had on them. + 

All a lie. + 

The Chris discount. + 

People always talk about remembering and using but not overusing your counterpart's name in a negotiation, and that's important. + 

The reality though is people are often tired of being hammered with their own name. + 

The slick salesman trying to drive them to yes will hit them with it over and over. + 

Instead, take a different tack and use your own name. + 

That's how I get the Chris discount. + 

Just as using Alaster's name with the kidnapper and getting him to use it back humanized the hostage and made it less likely he would be harmed, using your own name creates the dynamic of forced empathy. + 

It makes the other side see you as a person. + 

A few years ago, I was in a bar in Kansas with a bunch of fellow FBI negotiators. + 

The bar was packed, but I saw one empty chair. + 

I moved toward it, but just as I got ready to sit, the guy next to it said, "Don't even think about it." "Why?" I asked, and he said, "Because I'll kick your ass." He was big, burly, and already drunk. + 

But look, I'm a lifelong hostage negotiator. + 

I gravitate toward tense situations that need mediation like a moth to the flame. + 

I held out my hand to shake his and said, "My name is Chris." The dude froze and in the pause my fellow FBI guys moved in, patted him on the shoulders and offered to buy him a drink. + 

Turned out he was a Vietnam veteran at a particularly low point. + 

He was in a packed bar where the entire world seemed to be celebrating. + 

The only thing he could think of was to fight. + 

But as soon as I became Chris, everything changed. + 

Now take that mindset to a financial negotiation. + 

I was in an outlet mall a few months after the Kansas experience and I picked out some shirts in one of the stores. + 

At the front counter, the young lady asked me if I wanted to join their frequent buyer program. + 

I asked her if I got a discount for joining and she said no. + 

So, I decided to try another angle. + 

I said in a friendly manner, "My name is Chris. + 

What's the Chris discount?" She looked from the register, met my eyes, and gave a little laugh. + 

I'll have to ask my manager, Kathy," she said, and turned to the woman who'd been standing next to her. + 

Kathy, who'd heard the whole exchange, said, "The best I can do is 10%." Hey, my name is Aaron, and I'm here to humanize myself with your special price. + 

How to get your counterparts to bid against themselves. + 

Like you saw Aaron and Julie do with their kidnappers, the best way to get your counterparts to lower their demands is to say no using how questions. + 

These indirect ways of saying no won't shut down your counterpart the way a blunt, pride piercing no would. + 

In fact, these responses will sound so much like counter bids that your counterparts will often keep bidding against themselves. + 

We found that you can usually express no four times before actually saying the word. + 

The first step in the no series is the old standby. + 

How am I supposed to do that? You have to deliver it in a differential way. + 

So it becomes a request for help. + 

Properly delivered, it invites the other side to participate in your dilemma and solve it with a better offer. + 

After that, some version of your offer is very generous. + 

I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for me is an elegant second way to say no. + 

This well-ested response avoids making a counter offer, and the use of generous nurtures your counterpart to live up to the word. + 

The I'm sorry also softens the no and builds empathy. + 

You can ignore the so-called negotiating experts who say apologies are always signs of weakness. + 

Then you can use something like, "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I just can't do that." It's a little more direct. + 

And the can't do that does great double duty. + 

By expressing an inability to perform, it can trigger the other side's empathy toward you. + 

I'm sorry. + 

No is a slightly more succinct version for the fourth no. + 

If delivered gently, it barely sounds negative at all. + 

If you have to go further, of course, no is the last and most direct way. + 

Verbally, it should be delivered with a downward inflection and a tone of regard. + 

It's not meant to be no. + 

One of my students, a guy named Jesus Bueno, wrote me not long ago to tell me an amazing story about how he'd used the multi-step no to help his brother Waqin out of a sticky business situation. + 

His brother and two friends had bought a cannabis grow shop franchise in northern Spain where the cultivation of marijuana for personal use is legal. + 

Ween and his partner Bruno each invested €20,000 in the business for a 46% stake. + 

A minority partner invested another €3500 for 8%. + 

From the beginning, Waqin and Bruno had a rocky relationship. + 

We is an excellent salesman while Bruno was more of a bookkeeper. + 

The minority partner was also an excellent salesman and he and Waqen believed that growing sales was the correct strategy. + 

That meant offering discounts for large orders and repeat customers which Bruno disagreed with. + 

Their plan spending on launching a website and expanding inventory also rubbed Bruno the wrong way. + 

Then Bruno's wife became a problem as she started nagging Waqin about how he should not spend so much on expansion and instead take more profits. + 

One day we was reviewing inventory purchases and noticed that some items they had ordered had not been placed on the store shelves. + 

He began searching for them online. + 

And to his surprise, he found an eBay store set up with the wife's first name that was selling exactly those missing products. + 

This started a huge argument between Bruno and Waqin and soured their relationship. + 

In the heat of the moment, Bruno told Waqin that he was open to selling his shares because he felt the business risks they were taking were too large. + 

So, Waqen consulted with his brother, my student Jesus. + 

Because they believed that pressure from Bruno's wife was why he wanted to sell, Jesus helped craft an empathy message around that. + 

It seems like you were under a lot of pressure from your wife. + 

We was also in the middle of a divorce. + 

So, they decided to use that to relate to the wife issues and they prepared an accusation audit. + 

I know you think I don't care about costs and taking profits from the company in order to diffuse the negative energy and get Bruno talking. + 

It worked like a charm. + 

Bruno immediately agreed with the accusation audit and began explaining why he thought we was careless with spending. + 

Bruno also noted that he didn't have someone to bail him out like we did. + 

We got a startup loan from his mother. + 

We used mirrors to keep Bruno talking and he did. + 

Finally, we said, "I know how the pressure from your wife can feel. + 

I'm going through a divorce myself and it really takes a lot out of you." Bruno then went on a 10-minute rant about his wife and let slip a huge piece of information. + 

The wife was very upset because the bank that lent them the €20,000 had reviewed their loan and had given them two options. + 

Repay the loan in full or pay a much higher interest rate. + 

Bingo. + 

Waqin and Jesus huddled after learning that and decided that we could reasonably pay just above the loan price because Bruno had already taken $14,000 in salary from the business. + 

The letter from the bank put Bruno in a bad spot and Waqen figured he could bid low because there wasn't really a market for Bruno to sell his shares. + 

They decided that €23,000 would be the magic number with €11,000 upfront with the remaining €12,000 over a year period. + 

Then things went sideways. + 

Instead of waiting for Bruno to name a price, we jumped the gun and made his full offer, telling Bruno that he thought it was very fair. + 

If there's one way to put off your counterpart, it's by implying that disagreeing with you is unfair. + 

What happened next proved that Bruno angrily hung up the phone and two days later we received an email from a guy saying he'd been hired to represent Bruno. + 

They wanted €30,812. + 

20,000 for the loan, 4,000 for salary, 6,230 for equity, and 582 for interest. + 

Non-round figures that seemed unchangeable in their specificity. + 

This guy was a pro. + 

Jesus told that he'd truly screwed up. + 

But they both knew that Bruno was pretty desperate to sell. + 

So they decided to use the multi-step no strategy to get Bruno to bid against himself. + 

The worst case scenario, they decided was that Bruno would just change his mind about selling his shares and the status quo would continue. + 

It was a risk they'd have to take. + 

They crafted their first no message. + 

The price you offered is very fair and I certainly wish that I could afford it. + 

Bruno has worked very hard for this business and he deserves to be compensated appropriately. + 

I am very sorry but wish you the best of luck. + 

Notice how they made no counter offer and said no without using the word. + 

Waqin was shocked when the following day he received an email from the adviser lowering the price to €28,346. + 

Walken and Jesus then crafted their second gentle no. + 

Thank you for your offer. + 

You were generous to reduce the price which I greatly appreciate. + 

I really wish that I could pay you this amount but I am sincere in that I cannot afford this amount at this time. + 

As you know, I am in the middle of a divorce and I just cannot come up with that type of money. + 

Again, I wish you the best of luck. + 

The next day, we received a onelined email from the adviser dropping the price to €25,000. + 

Waqen wanted to take it, but Jesus told him that he had some no steps to go. + 

We fought him, but in the end, he relented. + 

There's a critical lesson there. + 

The art of closing a deal is staying focused to the very end. + 

There are crucial points at the finale when you must draw on your mental discipline. + 

Don't think about what time the last flight leaves or what it would be like to get home early and play golf. + 

Do not let your mind wander. + 

Remain focused. + 

They wrote, "Thank you again for the generous offer. + 

you have really come down on the price and I have tried very hard to come up with that amount. + 

Unfortunately, no one is willing to lend me the money, not even my mother. + 

I have tried various avenues but cannot come up with the funding. + 

In the end, I can offer you €23,567, although I can only pay 15,321 37 upfront. + 

I could pay you the remainder over a one-year period, but that is really the most I can do. + 

I wish you the best in your decision. + 

Brilliant use of specific numbers. + 

And what an empathybuilding way to say no without using the word. + 

And it worked. + 

Within 1 hour, the adviser responded to accept. + 

Look at this closely. + 

See how the mixture of mirroring and open-ended questions dragged out the information about Bruno's financial problems. + 

And then the no method exploited his desperation. + 

It might not have been a great idea to use this method if there'd been another buyer. + 

But with no one else, it was a brilliant way to get Bruno to bid against himself. + 

Key lessons. + 

Superstar negotiators, real rain makers know that a negotiation is a playing field beneath the words where really getting to a good deal involves detecting and manipulating subtle non-obvious signals beneath the surface. + 

It is only by visualizing and modifying these subsurface issues that you can craft a great deal and make sure that it is implemented. + 

As you put the following tools to use, remember this chapter's most important concept. + 

That is, yes without how. + 

Asking how, knowing how, and defining how are all part of the effective negotiator's arsenal. + 

He would be unarmed without them. + 

Ask calibrated how questions and ask them again and again. + 

Asking how keeps your counterparts engaged but offbalance. + 

Answering the questions will give them the illusion of control. + 

It will also lead them to contemplate your problems when making their demands. + 

Use how questions to shape the negotiating environment. +
