Hello,Chris Gardner *calling for* Mr. Walter Hobb. +
We were all *working* our way *up* 逐步发展；努力改进 _call sheets_ to sign (v.) clients. //我们都在努力逐一拨打电话列表上的号码，以签约客户。 +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Chris Gardner calling for ...
这是一种简洁的口语表达方式，用于电话交谈时自我介绍。这里省略了主语和动词“is”，这在非正式的口语中是常见的。 +
完整的句子应该是：“Hello, *this is* Chris Gardner calling for Mr. Walter Hobb.”

.We were all working our way up _call sheets_ to sign (v.) clients.
We were all *working* our way *up*: 我们都在努力逐步向上推进。 +
call sheets: 电话名单或电话清单，这是指列出需要拨打的电话号码的清单。

====

-From the bottom to the top.    -Yes,sir.  //依名单从下往上打电话联系 +
-From the doorman to the CEO.    -Okay.  //从门卫打到执行长 +

In order not to waste (v.) any time... +

Okay, thank you very much. +

I realized that by not hanging up the phone... +
...I gained (v.) another eight minutes a day. //我每天可以节约8分钟 +
Why, good morning to you, my name is Chris Gardner. +
-I'm calling from Dean Witter.

-I wasn't drinking water... +
...so I didn't ' waste any time in the bathroom 浴室；盥洗室;洗手间；卫生间. //所以不用浪费时间上厕所 +
Yes, I'd (=would) love to have the opportunity... +
Okay, no problem at all, sir. Thank you very much. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.I'd love to have the opportunity...
'd 是 "I would" 的缩写。这里的 “would” 表示一种愿望或愿望的表达。整句话的意思是“我非常愿意有这个机会…”
====


But even doing all this... +
...after two months,I still didn't have time *to work* my way *up* a sheet. //尽管如此. 2个月后，我连一张名单都没打完 +

Hello,sir. My name's Chris Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter. +
-Yeah,Chris.    -Yes,Mr. Ribbon... +
...I would love to have the opportunity to discuss some of our products. +
I'm certain that I could *be of some assistance (n.)帮助，援助 to you*. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.“be of some assistance to you”是一个固定表达，表示“对你有所帮助”。

“be of”结构在英语中, 常用于表示"*某人或某物具有某种特质或功能*"。这种结构比简单的“be some assistance” 更为正式和礼貌。以下是一些类似的表达： +
be of help: 对...有帮助 +
be of service: 提供服务 +
be of value: 有价值 +

**在这些表达中，“of”连接主语（在这里是“I”）和名词短语（“assistance”），表示主语具备后者的性质或功能。**因此，“be of some assistance”表示“I”能提供帮助。

如果去掉“of”，句子变成“I could be some assistance to you”，虽然仍然能理解，但听起来不够自然和正式。所以，“be of”结构使表达更正式和清晰。
