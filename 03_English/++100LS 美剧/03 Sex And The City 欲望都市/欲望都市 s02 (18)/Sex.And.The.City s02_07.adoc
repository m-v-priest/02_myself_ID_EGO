'''

There are over seven million people in New York. +
And that's not including houseguests. +
Visitors are a vital part of the city's economy. +
Most single people in Manhattan do not buy furniture or hang pictures +
until faced with the arrival of an out-of-towner. +
Hey, that's a great couch. Where'd it come from? +
I have no idea. +
Everything in Miranda's new apartment was hand-picked, +
covered, finished and arranged +
by Charlotte's friend, Madeline Dunn, +
an up-and-coming interior designer. +
I've been looking for one of those. +
That's very stylish for a pull-out. +
I'll have that end table for you tomorrow. +
Bye. +
-Thank you. You're welcome. +
This is a sofa bed? +
Yeah. +
That's what started this whole thing. +
I needed a sofa bed for Jeremy, +
and now if he actually sleeps on it +
while staying in my fabulous apartment, +
I may have to throw myself out a window treatment. +
Jeremy was an old friend of Miranda's +
who'd been in London for several years +
writing for The Economist . +
He was coming to New York to scope out the job situation. +
And Miranda suggested he be her houseguest, +
because his e-mails, always entertaining, +
had started to border on flirtatious. +
Meanwhile, I had become a frequent houseguest of Big's. +
Damn. Hey... +
do you have a spare toothbrush I could use? +
A spare toothbrush? +
Well, I'll bring you a new one. +
Excuse me. +
There's only one pink brush head +
and Big was giving his to me. +
It was the single most encouraging moment +
so far in our relationship. +
The next night when Jeremy arrived, +
he was even more adorable than Miranda remembered. +
I love your flat. +
Thanks. +
So how the hell are ya? +
Especially when he said... +
I'm tired of dating, I'm ready to get married. +
Miranda, are you here? +
Um... Coming! +
That must be my end table. +
See, my end table is afraid to go out alone. +
I hope you like the finish. +
It's a hair darker than I was thinking. +
Oh, hi, sorry to interrupt. +
That's beautiful, is it Biedermeier? +
Inspired by Biedermeier, good eye. +
I'm addicted to Architectural Digest. Jeremy Fields. +
-Oh, I'm sorry. This is-- -Madeline. +
Madeline Dunn. +
Pleasure. +
Well, thanks for bringing that by. +
We were just about to go out and get some dinner so... +
Yes, did you want to join us? +
Last week I was doing an interview at a restaurant in Kensington... +
Miranda suddenly found herself in the situation +
she was on a truly great first date. +
"Just be careful not to eat any buckshot!" +
Unfortunately, it was somebody else's. +
I should get Jeremy home. You must be jet-lagged. +
Actually, I feel great. +
I slept on the plane for once. +
Well, I'm pretty beat. +
Did you want to go? +
No, not if you're-- +
Go ahead, I can find my way back. +
Right, of course. We don't have to... +
Except I forgot to make a copy of the key. +
Um, Jeremy could use my key. +
Of course. +
I gave you a key. +
Well, then... +
Goodnight. I... +
Yeah. +
So, I was at that same restaurant... +
A week later, Miranda threw Jeremy a going away party. +
I'd like to make a toast to my good friend, Miranda, +
who not only put me up, she threw this soirée +
in celebration of my departure. +
Okay, Miranda, I get the hint. +
Uh... I'd especially like to thank her +
for introducing me to Madeline, +
an incredible, beautiful woman +
who must be drunk off her ass, +
because she just agreed to marry me. +
-Oh, my God! +
Apparently the only thing going away was Miranda's dream. +
Congratulations. +
Ice. +
We should get more ice. +
Everyone says as soon as you get a place of your own, someone will propose. +
I thought it would be to me. +
Well, at the very least, the woman owes you a mortgage payment. +
How is this even possible? These people just met. +
It's love at first sight. +
Oh, honey, this isn't love. +
This is about two people justifying +
a week of nonstop fucking. +
On my furniture, I have to redecorate. +
Well, I think this is encouraging. +
This means that even if you're not dating anybody, +
you could be engaged in a couple weeks. +
Or you could be dating someone for a year +
and be thrilled to get an electric toothbrush head. +
I don't understand why women are so obsessed about getting married. +
I mean, married people just want to be single again. +
If you're single, the world is your smorgasbord. +
Excuse me, +
can you tell me if this is where Jeremy Fields' engagement party is? +
It's the red awning, and it's a going away party. +
I can take you there if you'd like. +
Were you going to the party? +
Well, I was actually leaving the party +
because there were no handsome men there. +
But maybe the tide is turning. +
Oh, I get it. +
My apartment is gonna be lucky for everybody but me. +
What apartment isn't lucky for Samantha? +
-This is all your fault. -What? +
You introduced me to Madeline. +
I could have hired a nice gay decorator +
and none of this would've happened. +
But then Madeline and Jeremy might never have met. +
Yes, and Jeremy would've fallen in love with me. +
It's not like musical chairs. +
Why not me? What am I doing wrong? Am I invisible? +
Can I help you? +
I live here! +
That night, I needed a little reality check. +
Hello. +
Hey, I was just at this party, +
and two people who met a week ago announced their engagement. +
And? +
Well, I don't know, isn't that a bit shocking? +
Well, this is New York, nothing is shocking. +
We've embraced public urination. +
Yeah. +
But these people think they're soul mates. +
Did they actually use the term "soul mates?" +
Yeah, several times. +
Then I give them three months. +
What are you wearing? +
Do you believe in love at first sight? +
I believe in lust at first sight. +
-I'm serious. -So am I. +
C'mon, I need a visual. +
I don't know, a top, strapless. +
-It's denim. -Ooh. +
Hey, were you asleep when I called? +
Yes. +
-Sorry. -It's okay. +
But next time be at the door... +
naked. +
I started to wonder. +
In a city as cynical as New York, +
is it still possible to believe in love at first sight? +
I'd completely given up on the idea. +
But now I know the people who don't believe in love at first sight +
are the people who haven't experienced it. +
Love at first sight is for Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman. +
It's too flaky for New York. +
Here, women want to see a blood test and an ATM receipt +
before they give you their number. +
How can you believe in love at first sight +
in a city where people jerk off on you in the subway? +
I'm thinking a harpist for the ceremony. +
A bride, four weeks from her wedding, doesn't have time to meet you for coffee. +
So I joined Madeline for a mind-boggling hour +
in the presence of absolute certainty. +
Like a gorgeous Hampton's wedding, flowers, flowers, flowers everywhere. +
I'd like each bridesmaid to carry a different flower. +
So, tulips, irises, lilies, gerbera daisies. +
Charlotte should have the tulips. +
Did she mention she's one of my bridesmaids? +
Oh, of course, she's thrilled. +
I've already asked Miranda to do the guest books since she introduced us. +
And... +
You know, Carrie, I'm such a fan of your column. +
-Oh... -Is there any way you would consider +
writing something to read at our wedding? +
What does she want you to write? +
A poem about love. +
Dear God, I hope you said no. +
How do you say no to somebody who wants you to be involved in her wedding? +
If I could answer that, I wouldn't be in charge of the guest book. +
Oh... Why did I agree to this? +
I write about sex, not love. What do I know about love? +
I might have to get married now. +
What? +
That guy I picked up at Miranda's... +
If you're engaged, I am selling the apartment. +
Hardly. +
That night, we went back to my place... +
Tug my hair, tug my hair, tug my hair! +
It all seemed so familiar. +
She was having a "déjà fuck." +
What's wrong? +
I've slept with you before. +
Yeah, yeah, like 15 years ago. +
Well, why the hell didn't you say something? +
I just thought you were playing the sexy stranger game. +
So, it was kind of a reunion. +
I don't understand. How could you forget someone you slept with? +
Toto, I don't think we're in single digits anymore. +
Okay, but it's not like you shared a cab with this guy. +
I mean, you slept with him. +
Maybe we did it in a cab. +
I'd like to forget some of the men I've slept with. +
I keep a list. +
How sweet, "Men To Do Today." +
So, I'm officially out of men to fuck. +
I have to get married or move. +
That's lovely. Can I use that in my poem? +
It's yours. +
Wait till you guys see my bridesmaid's dress. +
Is it hideous? +
No, we got to pick our own. +
It's this amazing backless black satin. +
Mmm, pretty sexy for a bridesmaid. +
Well, all Madeline said was that it had to be black. +
Honey, calm down. +
No! +
I've been tasteful and appropriate +
at seven other weddings. +
I'm always, "Charlotte, don't look at me, look at the bride." +
This time, people are gonna look at me! +
For some reason, This whirlwind wedding +
was creating a great deal of stress for everyone +
but the bride and groom. +
The next night, I made the mistake of telling Big about the poem. +
"Love, glove, dove." +
"Dove" is good. +
Love is like a dove +
or a big fuzzy glove. +
Don't use that, I might've stolen it from a greeting card. +
Okay, thanks. +
What? This is fun. +
It's not supposed to be fun, this is somebody's wedding. +
A wedding is serious to some people. +
Then "shove" probably won't work. +
When is this wedding? +
It doesn't matter, you're not going. +
Oh, yes, I am. +
I wouldn't miss you reciting "love, glove, dove" +
in front of all of New York for anything. +
Oh, please. +
Things with Big were good. +
He was actually going with me to a wedding. +
Can I just say... Wow. +
Hey. +
I need a few minutes. +
Oh, I left the card here for you to sign. +
I don't need to sign it, they're your friends. +
They're not my friends and your name's on the invitation too. +
-Really? -Yes. +
It was my first time to get something +
other than Carrie Bradshaw and guest. +
How'd they get my name? +
Umm, I don't know, +
I guess Madeline must've asked Charlotte or something. +
Whatever. If you don't want to sign the card it's not a big deal. +
Would you like to sign the guest book? +
Hi, would you like to sign the guest book? +
At least we get to see who's arriving alone. +
Samantha could always be counted on to take life's lemons +
and make them into Spanish fly. +
Do you know where they want the gifts? +
Excuse me, I'm not the gift person. +
That's some other b-list friend. +
Oh, Christ! My rerun's here. +
Of course he's here, you met him at the engagement party. +
I have to start writing things down. +
I also have to start drinking heavily. +
Where's Big? +
Inside, looking bored. +
Hey, that's my look. +
Should I be bothered by the fact that he wouldn't sign the card? +
Well, I'm certainly glad I didn't ask him to sign the guest book. +
-Oh, yeah, that would've put him over the edge. -Ooh! +
Charlotte wasn't kidding about the dress. +
It was hard not to notice her. +
Look at you! Oh, my God! +
-You look amazing. You are... -Spin... +
-Holy moly. -Oh, my gosh, I am so late. +
Hi, are you with the bride or the groom? +
Actually, I'm a bridesmaid. +
-Oh, are you Charlotte? -Yes. +
Hi, I'm Martin Healy. I'll be walking you down the aisle. +
All her life, Charlotte had imagined doing exactly that +
with someone exactly like Martin. +
I'll show you where you're supposed to be. +
Okay. +
Hello, are you seeing this? +
I've been here half an hour, that guy never even looked at me. +
While Miranda was feeling invisible, +
I was feeling far too visible. +
I'm in the program? I barely know the bride and groom. +
They barely know each other. +
Hey, look, I'm right between the vows and the fish course. +
Am I in there? No, of course not. +
Well, I better find Big. +
I'm coming with you. +
Can you leave the guest book unattended? +
It's a bullshit job, Carrie. +
People know what to do with the guest book. +
The ceremony was short and sweet, just like the engagement. +
And now, please welcome our newlyweds... +
Mr. Jeremy Fields +
and Mrs. Madeline Dunn-Fields. +
Woo! +
It's amazing. +
It took her six months to find me an end table, +
but she can plan a wedding at the Plaza in four weeks. +
Five bucks says that your end table +
will last longer than her marriage. +
-Hip, hip... Hooray! +
People have said a lot of nice things about Jeremy +
and I am here to make a rebuttal. +
Seriously, I have known Jeremy a long time. +
Which is more than the bride could say. +
-Shh! I'm very happy for you both. +
I only hope that someday I can have what you two have, +
8,000 little napkins with my name on them. +
And, you know, of course, someone to love. +
Aw... -Cheers. +
Thank you. +
And now we have a very special treat. +
One of my favorite writers, Carrie Bradshaw, +
has agreed to share a poem that she wrote for the occasion. +
Shit. +
As I made my way to the microphone, +
I could only think one thing... +
Dead woman walking. +
"His hello was the end of her endings. +
Her laugh was their first step down the aisle. +
His hand would be hers to hold forever. +
-His forever was as simple as her smile." +
And suddenly it hit me. +
Two people were committing to a life together +
and I couldn't even get a guy to be on a card with me. +
"He said she was what was missing. +
She said instantly she knew. +
She was a question to be answered... +
And... +
His answer was 'I do.'" +
I had no choice but to embrace the moment +
and try to pass off my tears +
as tears of joy for the happy couple. +
Charlotte, can I have the salad dressing? +
I want three or four kids too. +
Okay, okay, well, where do you stand on dog vs. cat? +
You know, I think that this should be our song. +
Then we should dance to it. +
Okay. +
What, are they on the Evelyn Wood plan too? +
Sorry. +
I had to take a call. +
Did I miss anything? +
Well, you missed my poem and most of the reception. +
But there's nothing like a slow dance +
to make you forgive and forget. +
Uh, maybe later, I hate to dance while people are eating. +
Alrighty. +
Well, I'll be at the bar where people are drinking. +
Say hello to my date. +
I think I know you from somewhere. +
It's very possible we fucked. +
No, I think I know you from college. +
Then we probably fucked in college. +
Another Cosmopolitan please. +
And a scotch, straight up. +
Oh, it's the famous poet, Carrie Bradshaw. +
Can we not talk about the poem, please? +
Honey, come on, it was perfect. +
Except the crying, what was that about? +
Big took a call during my poem. +
It's not important to him. +
Nothing is important to him. +
Guess what? +
The guest book person is also +
the "put the gifts in the van" person. +
Does anybody want to help me, +
or should I just go stand out in the street and wait for somebody else +
not to see me so I can end it? +
I'll help you. +
What street do you want to stand in? +
Mmm! +
If they get married in less than a month, I'm not going. +
Ooh, careful, that one's from me. +
Well, what are you giving them? +
The dancing frogs. +
Even while on the verge of breaking +
the land speed record for relationships, +
Charlotte took her duties as bridesmaid very seriously. +
-Wow! +
Isn't it beautiful? +
So how do we do this exactly? +
Oh, we just throw some silly string around +
and write something funny on the mirror in lipstick. +
And then some people throw condoms on the bed, +
but I personally prefer rose petals. +
Oh, yeah. +
I would love to wake up in rose petals. +
It was all so romantic. +
The bed, the rose petals, +
the bed... +
Oh! +
Technically, it wasn't a third date, +
but they'd already had dinner... and been dancing. +
Twenty minutes later, Charlotte worried she'd made a rookie mistake +
by sleeping with a man she thought she could marry. +
But then something wonderful happened. +
Charlotte, I want to introduce you to my parents. +
Meeting the parents. +
Charlotte was back on schedule. +
Did you see us? +
We've been dancing up a storm. +
Uh... Yeah. +
Would you like a free lesson? +
Oh, my dad considers himself quite the dancer. +
Oh, that would be great. +
Good. +
Well, is she the one? +
-You're a beautiful dancer. -Oh, thank you. +
Oh! +
May I cut in? +
If you must. +
Isn't he something? +
And he's very smart. +
He's pretty much my role model. +
He used to take me to his office when I was a little kid. +
Your father just felt me up. +
What? +
We were dancing and he just put his hand-- +
All right, look, my parents have been married for 50 years. +
My dad would not cop a feel +
just because some girl is wearing a slutty dress. +
Suddenly, it was clear to Charlotte +
that Martin wasn't gonna take her side now +
or after three or four kids, or ever. +
Did the last four and a half hours mean nothing to you? +
The chicken dance, ladies and gentlemen. +
Oh, darn, we missed the chicken dance. +
Excuse me. +
Have you seen my date? +
I'm sorry, I had to help Miranda put the gifts into the van. +
So, are you ready to go? +
Well, have they even cut the cake yet? +
I don't know. +
But I can tell you how it turns out. +
If you want to go, go. +
What? +
What's wrong? +
You wouldn't even sign the card. +
The card. +
I'm afraid we don't want the same things. +
Things like cake? +
I want someone who's going to be with me until the end... +
of a wedding. +
Okay. +
I'll stay. +
You will? +
Yes. +
Single ladies! +
It's time for the tossing of the bouquet. +
Isn't the bouquet toss at the end? +
Congratulations, you lucked out. +
Get us some cake, I want to say goodbye to my friends. +
Oh! Hey... -Hi. +
Big moment. +
Big and I are leaving. +
He's crossed his pain threshold and he's carrying me along with him. +
-Everybody ready? +
One, two, three. +
Okay, girls, see you tomorrow. +
-Okay. -Okay. +
-Night-night. -Okay. +
-Well, let's... let's get your coats. Mm-hmm. +
Some people know they're meant to be together. +
I knew I was meant to go home and have cake in bed with Big. +
Maybe we're more the fuzzy glove types. +
欲望城市 +
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） +
闻鸡起舞 +
纽约有超过七百万人口 +
不包括来访的客人 +
游客是城里经济主要来源 +
大多数在曼哈顿的 单身贵族都不买家具 +
直到家里有客人来访 +
-沙发好棒，哪里买的？ -我不知道 +
米兰达新家的所有家具 +
都是由夏绿蒂的新锐 室内设计师朋友 +
玛德琳唐恩一手包办购买 +
-我一直在找这样的东西 -这是非常时髦的沙发床 +
茶几明天就会送来 +
谢谢 +
这是沙发床？ +
事情是这样的 +
我需要帮杰瑞米买沙发床 +
要是他在这里的这段期间 都睡在这 +
我就从窗户跳下去 +
杰瑞米是米兰达的老朋友 +
长年住在伦敦 +
他到纽约勘查就业环境 +
米兰达建议他到她家作客 +
因为他的电子邮件 出现一些调情的字眼 +
在此同时 我成了大人物家中的常客 +
你有多余的牙刷借我吗？ +
-多余的牙刷？ -我再买一支新的给你 +
借过 +
他把唯一的粉红牙刷头给我 +
这是我们关系中 最令人雀跃的一刻 +
杰瑞米远比米兰达记忆中 来得迷人 +
-我喜欢你的公寓 -谢谢，你好吗？ +
尤其当他说出… +
我厌倦了不断约会 我准备好要结婚了 +
-米兰达，你在吗？ -来了 +
-一定是我的茶几来了 -我的茶几还不敢独自出门呢 +
我希望你喜欢它的末道漆 比我想像中要黑 +
-抱歉打扰了 -好美，这是比德迈式的吗？ +
灵感来自比德迈，好眼光 +
我很喜欢阅读“建筑文摘” 我叫杰瑞米菲尔德 +
-抱歉，这位是… -玛德琳唐恩 +
很荣幸 +
谢谢你帮我带过来 我们正要出去吃晚餐 +
你要一起来吗？ +
上周我在一家餐厅做专访 +
米兰达的遭遇 足以让所有女人称羡 +
她有一个很棒的第一次约会 +
“小心不要吃到鹿弹” +
不幸地，她似乎是第三者 +
我应该要带杰瑞米回家了 你一定有时差 +
不会，我觉得精神很好 我在飞机上睡了 +
-这样，我很累了 -你想回家吗？ +
不了，如果你… +
去吧，我可以找到回家的路 +
对，我们不必… +
不过我忘了再打一副钥匙 +
杰瑞米可以用我的钥匙 +
当然 +
我给了你一副钥匙 +
那么，晚安 +
-晚安 -我在那家餐厅… +
一周后，米兰达为杰瑞米 举行一场欢送派对 +
我想举杯敬我的好友米兰达 +
她不但让我借住 还帮我办了这个晚会 +
庆祝我的离开 米兰达，我知道你的暗示了 +
我尤其要感谢她 介绍玛德琳给我 +
一位不可思议的女人 她一定是醉了 +
才会答应嫁给我 +
唯一离去的是米兰达的美梦 +
恭喜 +
冰，我们需要多一点冰 +
有人说为自己买个家 就会有人来求婚 +
我以为他喜欢的是我 +
这个女人欠你抵押款 +
-这怎么可能？他们才刚认识 -这叫做“一见钟情” +
那才不是爱 只是一个礼拜的性爱马拉松 +
而且是在我的家具上 我一定要重新装潢 +
这真是令人雀跃 表示就算不约会 +
也可以在几个礼拜内订婚 +
或是约会一年 得到一只电动牙刷刷头 +
女人为什么对结婚这件事 这么迷恋？ +
已婚的人都想恢复单身 +
如果你是单身 全世界都是你的 +
这是杰瑞米菲尔德的 订婚派对吗？ +
红色雨篷那里，那是个欢送会 +
-我可以带你过去 -你要去吗？ +
我提早离开因为那里没有俊男 +
现在不一样了 +
我的公寓为别人带来幸运 +
哪一间公寓不曾带给 莎曼珊幸运？ +
这都是你的错 是你介绍玛德琳给我 +
我可以雇用同性恋设计师 这一切就不会发生了 +
他们不会相遇 +
杰瑞米就会爱上我 +
这又不是抢椅子游戏 +
为什么新娘不是我？ 我做错什么？我隐形了吗？ +
-能效劳吗？ -我住在这里 +
那一晚，我需要找人谈一谈 +
我参加的这场派对 +
有两个人认识一周就订婚 +
-所以说？ -这不是很骇人听闻吗？ +
在纽约没有什么骇人听闻的事 当众便溺都可以接受了 +
但是他们认为对方是灵魂伴侣 +
-他们真的这么说？ -好几次 +
绝对撑不过三个月 你现在穿什么？ +
-你相信一见钟情吗？ -我相信一见起色心 +
-我是认真的 -我也是 +
我需要一点视觉飨宴 +
我不知道，无肩带上衣 丁尼布料 +
-我打给你时是不是睡了？ -对 +
-抱歉 -没关系 +
下一次来应门时…不要穿衣服 +
我不禁开始想 +
在纽约这样一个 愤世嫉俗的城市 +
还有可能相信一见钟情吗？ +
我以前不相信，但现在我知道 +
不相信一见钟情 是因为你没有经历过 +
一见钟情是给花花公子女郎的 在纽约简直不可能 +
在这里，女人在给电话号码前 +
要先看验血单和提款机收据 +
在这里 地铁站都有人朝你打手枪 +
你怎么能相信一见钟情？ +
再一个月就要结婚的女人 没有时间喝咖啡 +
所以我去玛德琳 准备婚宴的现场 +
一个到处都是花的婚礼 +
每个伴娘都拿着不同的花 郁金香，鸢尾花，百合 +
夏绿蒂应该要拿郁金香 她是我的伴娘之一 +
我们请米兰达负责签名簿 因为她是介绍人 +
凯莉，我真的好喜欢你的专栏 +
你可以帮我写些婚礼致词吗？ +
-她要你写些什么？ -关于爱的诗 +
-我希望你拒绝了 -你要怎么拒绝？ +
我要是知道就不会答应 负责签名簿了 +
我能写些什么？ 我写的是性，不是爱 +
我可以跟那个在欢送会上 遇到的男人结婚 +
要是你结婚了 我就要把公寓卖掉 +
简直不 +
那天晚上，我们回到我家 +
拉我的头发… +
这一幕是那么地熟悉 她感到似曾相识 +
-怎么了？ -我以前跟你上过床 +
-对，大概十五年前 -你为什么不说？ +
我以为你在玩性感陌生人游戏 +
-真像个大团圆 -你忘了你睡过的人？ +
我们再也没有关连了 +
你不是跟他共乘计程车 你是跟他上床 +
-地点或许是在计程车上 -我也想忘了某些人 +
-我会写名单 -真甜：今日“共事”的男人 +
我已经找不到上床的陌生男人 我得结婚不然就搬家 +
-我可以写进我的诗里吗？ -拿去用吧 +
你得看看我的伴娘礼服 +
-很难看吗？ -不，我们自己挑 +
不可思议，露背黑缎 +
-对伴娘来说很性感 -玛德琳指定要黑色 +
亲爱的，冷静一下 +
我曾穿着合宜美丽地 出席七场婚宴 +
这分明是 “不要看我，看新娘” +
这一次我将成为众人焦点 +
这场旋风式婚礼 带给所有人压力 +
除了新郎新娘以外 +
次晚，我犯了个错误 把写诗这件事告诉大人物 +
爱，手套，鸽子，鸽子不错 +
爱就像鸽子 或是毛茸茸的大手套 +
我可以从贺卡上面窃取点子 +
-谢了 -怎么了？这很有趣 +
不应该是有趣 那可是一场婚礼 +
婚礼对某些人来说是很严肃的 +
那就不能用“铲子”了 +
-婚礼何时举行？ -何必问？你又不会去 +
我会去 +
我不会错过听你朗诵 “爱，手套，鸽子” +
（四个星期后） +
和大人物之间进展顺利 他要跟我去参加婚礼 +
我可不可以只说…“天” +
再几分钟就好 卡片等着你签名 +
我不需要签名 +
你的名字也在邀请函上 +
真的吗？ +
第一次我的男伴名字被印上去 +
他们怎么知道我的名字？ +
玛德琳可能问了夏绿蒂 +
你不想签名也没关系 +
要不要签个名？ +
要不要签个名？ +
要不要签个名？ +
至少我们知道谁一个人来 +
莎曼珊这一点值得鼓励 +
凡事都能往好的一面想 +
-礼物放哪里？ -抱歉，我不是负责的人 +
老天，我的炮友在这里 +
当然 你是在订婚宴上遇到他的 +
我得开始把事情记下来 还得多喝点酒 +
大人物在哪里？ +
-里面，看起来很无聊 -我看起来也是那样 +
他不签卡片我应该心烦吗？ +
还好我没叫他签签到簿 +
那应该会把他逼疯 +
夏绿蒂的礼服不是吹嘘 大家很难不注意到她 +
-看看你 -我的天 +
我迟到了 +
-你是新娘或新郎亲友？ -我是伴娘 +
你是夏绿蒂吗？我是马丁希力 我要跟你一起走红毯 +
终其一生 夏绿蒂就是在等这一刻 +
和马丁这样的人走红毯 +
我带你去准备处 +
你有看到吗？ 他根本没瞧我一眼 +
当米兰达觉得自己像隐形人 我觉得自己太受瞩目了 +
我在节目表上？ 我跟新郎新娘并不熟 +
-他们也不太认识对方 -我在誓言跟餐会之间 +
我有在里面吗？当然没有 +
-我最好去找大人物 -我跟你去 +
你不管签到簿了？ +
客人知道这是做什么用的 +
典礼简短温馨 +
现在欢迎我们的新婚夫妇 +
杰瑞米菲尔德先生 和玛德琳唐恩菲尔德太太 +
她花了六个月帮我找茶几 +
却在四个礼拜办好一场婚礼 +
我赌五块你的茶几 比她的婚姻持久 +
大家说了不少杰瑞米的好话 +
我在此要反驳 +
我认识杰瑞米很久了 +
比新娘要久得多 +
我希望有一天 能和你们两位一样 +
有八千份印有我名字的餐巾 +
当然，还有一个心爱的人 +
举杯 +
现在，我们有一个特别节目 +
我最喜爱的作家之一 凯莉布雷萧 +
替这个特别的场合写了一首诗 +
可恶 +
当我走向麦克风时 我只有一个念头 +
走向死亡线 +
他的招呼是她结局的终点 +
她的笑声是他们走向 红毯的第一步 +
他的手要让她牵一辈子 +
他承诺的永远就像她的微笑 那么简单 +
我突然间想到： 有两个人缘定终生 +
我却没办法要一个男人 跟我签同一张卡片 +
他说她就是那失落的一角 +
她立刻说她懂 +
她就是那个等待被回答的问题 +
他的答案是“我愿意” +
我别无选择 只能拥抱这个时刻 +
并传递我喜悦的眼泪 给这对新人 +
可以帮我拿沙拉酱吗？ +
-我也想要三或四个孩子 -再养只小猫小狗如何？ +
这应该是我们的曲子 +
那么我们应该跳支舞 +
他们也要有样学样吗？ +
抱歉，我得接电话 我有错过什么吗？ +
你错过了我念诗 和大部分的节目 +
但是一支慢舞 可以让人原谅并忘记 +
我不喜欢在别人吃饭时跳舞 +
我到吧台喝杯酒 +
跟我的男伴打声招呼 +
-我看过你 -我们可能上过床 +
-好像是在大学时认识你 -我们或许在大学时代上过床 +
-再一杯四海为家 -一杯威士忌，不加冰 +
是那位有名的诗人凯莉布雷萧 +
我们能不能不要谈到诗？ +
很棒，除了那些眼泪 到底怎么了？ +
大人物在我念诗时接电话 +
那对他而言不重要 没有一件事对他重要 +
负责签到簿还要顺便 负责搬礼物 +
你们要帮忙吗？ +
还是要我等到 没有人看到时溜掉 +
我帮你，你要往哪边走？ +
如果他们在一个月内结婚 我一定不去参加 +
-小心一点，这是我送的 -你送他们什么？ +
跳舞的青蛙 +
即使就快要破了 感情发展速度的纪录 +
夏绿蒂还是尽责地完成 伴娘的工作 +
-好漂亮 -我们该怎么做？ +
我们把细绳随意抛 再写一些好玩的东西在镜子上 +
有人会在床上丢保险套 我比较喜欢玫瑰花瓣 +
我喜欢在玫瑰花瓣中醒来 +
一切都是那么地浪漫 那张床，玫瑰花瓣… +
那张床 +
在技术上，这不是第三次约会 但他们吃过饭，跳过舞 +
夏绿蒂担心和这位理想中的 结婚对象上床 +
是个错误 +
会有不好的事发生 +
我想把你介绍给我父母 +
父母…夏绿蒂的计划 又回到正轨 +
你有看到我们跳舞吗？ 就像起风暴一样 +
-想要免费教学吗？ -我爸爸很会跳舞 +
我很乐意 +
就是她了吗？ +
你是个美丽的舞者 +
-我可以接手吗？ -如果你坚持 +
他很棒是不是？很聪明 他是我学习的榜样 +
他以前会带我到办公室… +
你父亲刚才吃我豆腐 +
我们在跳舞时他的手… +
我父母结婚五十年了 +
我爸爸不会因为一个女人 穿着暴露 +
就吃她豆腐 +
夏绿蒂当下明白 +
马丁永不会站在她那一边 +
过去的四个半小时 对你来说没意义吗？ +
可恶，我们错过了鸡舞 +
抱歉，你有看到我的女伴吗？ +
抱歉，我得帮米兰达 把礼物搬上车 +
-你要走了吗？ -他们切蛋糕了吗？ +
我不知道 但我知道那是怎么回事 +
如果你想走，就走吧 +
-怎么了？ -你连卡片都不肯签 +
卡片？ +
我怕我们想要的不一样 +
譬如说蛋糕？ +
我要的是有人能一直陪我… +
到婚礼结束 +
好，我留下来 +
-真的？ -真的 +
单身女郎们，要抛花束了 +
-花束不是最后抛吗？ -恭喜你，你走运了 +
我去跟我朋友说再见 +
很重大的一刻 +
大人物跟我要先离开 他已经忍受不了了 +
准备好了吗？ +
一、二、三 +
-姐妹们，明天见 -晚安 +
我们去拿你的外套 +
有些人知道他们注定 和某人共度一生 +
我知道我注定要和大人物 回家在床上吃蛋糕 +
这就是我们的爱情方式吧 +
