Once upon a time, +
in a kingdom far away, +
a certain man and a slightly less certain woman +
kept bumping into one another. +
They seemed to meet everywhere. +
On street corners, +
at parties. +
It was almost as if they were dating accidentally. +
And then, after another chance meeting +
at a wealthy lawyer's new son's bris... +
Oh! +
...they decided to pick a time to bump into each other on purpose. +
You wanna go out and get... +
Saturday, 10:30, +
the hottest new restaurant in Manhattan. +
-You're not on the list. Samantha's PR firm was handling the opening. +
Hi. -Hey. +
Hey! Hi, pretty. +
So, isn't Brian great? +
Charlotte had a new boyfriend. +
looks, manners, money. +
Did I tell you he wants to buy a painting from my gallery? +
Love and a commission, she couldn't have been happier. +
Alright, it's official, he's late. +
Who? +
Mr. Big, who else? +
Carrie, that's great! Is it a date? +
No, he called it a "thing." +
He said "Meet me... +
meet me for a drink thing." +
He never used the "D" word. +
Well, thing is good. +
I mean, thing comes before date. +
Well, let's hope so. Alright, I'm gonna go in. +
-Okay. -Okay. +
See you in there. +
Where did Skipper go? +
Oh, I don't know how you can date that younger guy. +
I mean, they're so scattered and unfocused. +
We're not dating, it's a fuck thing. +
-Girls, isn't this fun? Hello! +
I've turned away twenty so far. +
People are actually crying. +
Okay. Bye. +
Um, something came up. +
He's not gonna meet me. +
Here, will you listen to this and tell me if you can figure out +
whether he's not meeting me as a date +
or not meeting me as a friend? +
Alright. +
Sometimes you need a second opinion. +
With doctors, real estate, men. +
Well? +
I have no idea. +
And I finished first in my litigation class. +
How pathetic do I feel +
asking you if a guy kinda likes me? +
There you are! +
Hey! -Hey. +
Hi. +
Carrie, Miranda, +
this is the hottest chef in New York, Jon. +
Jon. +
J-o-n. +
No "H", no last name. +
His blue crab strudel was so fabulous he didn't need one. +
And this is his very cute friend, Sam. +
Hey. +
Sam? +
Who's named Sam? +
Me. +
Can I get you a drink? +
Oh, good luck, the bar is packed. +
No problem, 'cause the bartender's a buddy of mine. +
-Miranda? Martini. +
Twenty-something guys always know the really important "B" +
busboys, bouncers. +
Plus, they have cute butts. +
Hmm... +
That's the Times critic. +
I'd better go. +
Mmm. +
Did I mention I'm sleeping with him? +
Skipper! +
He's lost. We gotta... +
They stopped making martinis, +
so I got us two rum and Cokes, is that okay? +
Well, I hate rum and I hate Coke, +
but thanks. +
Martinis, ladies? -Well, look at you. +
I was a waiter at TGIF. +
Fabulous. +
-Hey. -Hey. +
-Sam. -Skipper. +
-Hey. -Hey. +
They liked each other immediately. +
You want to see something? +
Come here. +
Can you narrow that down a little bit? +
Wait. I didn't-- +
No fair. Do it over. Let me see it. +
Oh! +
-Hey! -Hey! +
It's you. +
I've been looking all over for you. +
Here you are, +
holding a tongue. +
Well, your message said you weren't coming. +
I thought I said I'd try to make it for an hour. +
Well, yeah, but then you said that-- +
-What-- What did I say? -Never mind, never mind. +
You're here. You have an hour. Let's have a drink. +
Well, I was outside trying to get in for 30 minutes, +
inside looking for you for 20 minutes. +
So that leaves me with just enough time to tell you that... +
I'm out of time. You have fun. +
Men in their 40's are like the New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle. +
Tricky, complicated, +
and you're never really sure you've got the right answer. +
This place is tired. +
Do you want to get out of here? +
Sure. +
Uh-huh. +
Why not? +
A short cab ride later, +
Samantha, Jon, no "H", Sam and I, +
found ourselves at the nearby twenty-something club. +
I can't believe you made Jon leave his own opening. +
Well, he is way too happening +
to be seen someplace borderline tired. +
It was a tough town. +
Hot places had the life span of a med fly. +
Samantha, +
everybody in here is in their twenties. +
And so are we. +
As I glanced around the room, +
I was amazed at the wide variety of great twenty-something guys. +
The groovy guy. +
The corporate guy. +
The jock guy. +
The underage guy. +
Oh, there you are. How are you? +
Big couch. +
Oh, here. You can squeeze. +
Oh! Whoa! +
Oh! +
I'm all right. +
I'm not too heavy? I don't weigh too much? +
Oh, right, you weigh like nothing. +
Aw, what's cuter than that? +
As we took a swig from our pony-necked beers, +
I remembered another type of twenty-something guy. +
So, +
what's it like to kiss with that thing? +
You want to find out? +
The really good kisser guy. +
Hello. +
I am so fucked. +
What's wrong? +
No, I mean, literally. +
I have been fucked every way you can be fucked. +
If you keep talking like that, I'm going to have to charge you by the minute. +
As I searched for my morning Marlboro Light, +
Samantha proceeded to give me a rundown of her night with Jon. +
No "H", no inhibitions. +
We did it with him on top. +
Me on top. Me on my side. +
Him on his side? +
Oh, God, yes. +
On his back, +
on his side, +
on his face. +
Have you ever done that? +
It's too early to remember. +
Well, do it immediately. +
It is fabulous. +
These guys in their twenties, they are up for anything. +
How did it go with, uh... +
you and Sam? +
We kissed. +
Just kissed? +
No. We just kissed for five hours. +
At the club, in front of the club, on the corner of the club. +
I forgot how much fun it is to just kiss, you know, +
even if I did only get about two hours sleep. +
I didn't sleep at all. +
As Samantha went on about her sexual escapades, +
I glanced down at my arm. +
There it was in Bic blue. +
Twenty-something Sam's phone number. +
I had this sudden urge to call but I'd just left him. +
Hell, my lips were still swollen. +
Why this sudden craving? +
Are men in their twenties the new designer drug? +
Yes, Samantha, Miranda and I were all recreational users, +
but were we getting into something we couldn't handle? +
Okay. We were attracted to younger men for various reasons. +
But I couldn't help but wonder, +
what do they see in us? +
Women in their thirties are just so grateful. +
It's like every bullshit, nice thing you do +
is like throwing food to the starving. +
Take your shot! +
They give great head and know a lot about wine. +
They remind me of my mom. +
They know who they are and what they want. And I like that. +
Come on, take it! Come on, take it, man! +
Fuck! +
smart pussy. +
Shoot it! +
Later that week, Miranda and I compared notes. +
Shouldn't we be dating men our own age? +
Good luck finding one. +
There are no available men in their thirties in New York. +
Giuliani had them removed along with the homeless. +
Well, so then what's really going on here? +
I mean, is it younger... younger men feel safer? +
What's really going on here is sex. +
Good old fashioned, eager to please, +
do what I tell you to, Eagle Scout sex. +
Yeah, but I'm not having sex. +
It's a kissing thing. +
So what's the big deal? +
It's just a fling. +
It's not like we're throwing out our schedules or anything. +
Oh, sweetie, I gotta go. +
-Yeah? -I'm late for a meeting with my editor. +
-Oh. Bye! +
Bye. +
I didn't want to tell her I canceled lunch +
with my editor to go to Banana Republic +
and help twenty-something Sam pick out a shirt. +
Here. +
As I helped him try them on, I thought... +
he's sweet, he's fun, and I think he likes me. +
Could he be more than a fling? +
Could he be a potential boyfriend? +
Please. +
This isn't the Gap. +
What's wrong with him? +
And speaking of potential boyfriends... +
later that week the crossword puzzle +
asked me to meet him for a drink, blank. +
Not quite a date, five letters, starts with a "T". +
Yeah, whoever this is, I can't talk. +
-I'm late for a drink thing. -I just need five minutes. +
I'm meeting Brian later and I don't know what to do. +
-About what? Well, last night +
after a movie, we were walking down 2nd Avenue +
-and we we just pass that cute little-- -Four minutes, Charlotte. +
Okay, I can't just blurt out what he asked me, it's embarrassing. +
What? +
What did the perfect boyfriend ask? +
Meet me in front of your apartment in ten minutes. +
Okay, words are essential. +
Tell me exactly how he worded it. +
"We've been seeing each other for a couple of weeks. +
I really like you, +
and tomorrow night after dinner, +
I want us to have anal sex." +
Okay, next stop is gonna be 62nd and Madison. +
Sixty-second and Madison? +
We're picking up Miranda. +
-No, God, no. -Yes, and then +
-we're picking up Samantha. -Oh, Carrie, no. +
Sweetie, listen, you need all the girl support you can get +
and I'm late for drinks with Big. +
Oh, that's great. +
Even in her state of abject blackness, +
Charlotte was a dating optimist. +
It all depends. +
-How much do you like him? -A lot. +
Dating a few months until someone better comes along a lot, +
or marrying and moving to East Hampton a lot? +
I don't know. I'm not sure. +
Well, you better get sure real quick. +
You're scaring me. +
-Okay. -Don't scare her. +
It's all about control. +
If he goes up there, there's going to be a shift in power. +
Either he'll have the upper hand or you will. +
Now there's a certain camp that believe whoever holds +
the dick, holds the power but... +
Hello. +
You're driving. +
if he goes up your butt, +
will he respect you more or respect you less? +
That's the issue. +
No, no smoking in cab. +
Sir, we're talking up the butt. +
A cigarette is in order. +
Front, back, who cares? +
A hole is a hole. +
Can I quote you? +
Oh, don't be so judgmental. +
You could use a little back door. +
I'm not a hole. +
Honey, we know. +
Look, all I'm saying, that this is... +
This is a physical expression that the body was-- +
well, it was designed to experience. +
And P.S. +
It's fabulous. +
What are you talking about? +
I went to Smith. +
Look, I'm just saying, with the right guy +
and the right lubricant... +
Whoa. +
What was that? +
A preview? +
Thanks. +
Well, I can't believe it. +
Same time, same place. +
Just you and me. +
Well, sort of. +
Meet my friend, Jack. +
Oh. +
Hi, how are you? +
Marvelous. Going through my second divorce, +
bitch is getting everything the first bitch didn't. +
There he was, right in the middle of my drink thing. +
Mr. Marvelous. +
Jesus. +
Look at that beautiful woman. +
I'm gonna go ask her to join us for dinner. +
Excuse me. +
Okay. +
He called me crying. +
Do you forgive me? +
Here's what. +
Why don't you two have a guy's night. +
You know, talk, cry, shoot bear. +
I'm way behind on my column anyway. +
Here. +
Next round on me. +
We'll do our thing another time. +
Are you sure? +
Abso-fucking-lutely. +
I didn't know what I was supposed to feel. +
Confused, sad, rejected? +
I decided to walk to clear my head. +
Also, I just left my cab fare on the table. +
So I walked. +
I walked 48 blocks in four hundred dollar shoes. +
I just needed something to take the edge off. +
A little kiss to make me feel better. +
But now, it wasn't working. +
I wasn't getting the same rush. +
Tonight, I needed more. +
Meanwhile, uptown, Charlotte wondered when relationships had gotten so complicated. +
She yearned for the time when dinner was followed by dessert, +
not lubricant. +
I-- I can't, Brian, I can't. +
I want to, but I can't. +
I mean, actually, no, that's not true. I don't want to. +
Or maybe I do. I don't know what I want, but, +
I'm afraid if I don't then you'll dump me +
and if I do, then I'll be the up-the-butt-girl. +
And I don't want to be the up-the-butt-girl. +
Because, I mean, men don't marry the up-the-butt-girl. +
Who ever heard of Mrs. Up-The-Butt? +
No, no, no. +
I can't. +
I want children and nice bedding and... +
I just can't handle this right now. +
Can we fuck the regular way? +
Yes, please. +
That night they made +
polite and respectful +
on three hundred count Egyptian cotton sheets. +
Meanwhile, downtown... +
That was really great. +
Do you know... +
Yeah. +
-...when you lay like that... -Mm-hmm. +
...you have the cutest little wrinkles in your neck. +
Samantha realized as long as she dated someone younger, +
she would always be older. +
She gave up twenty-somethings right then and there. +
As Samantha went cold turkey... +
I got in deeper and deeper. +
Oh, that was... +
Totally awesome. +
I was hooked. Gone. +
Who cares about age, +
crossword puzzles, +
the cab money I'd left on the table? +
This felt so good. +
I'd do anything to keep this high. +
And just when I thought I couldn't get any higher... +
he spooned me. +
I woke up wanting more, or maybe not. +
In the gray morning light, +
everything looked completely different. +
Candles from Urban Outfitter, dirty laundry, a pizza box. +
Suddenly, reality hit. +
I'm in a twenty-something apartment. +
Morning, babe. +
Morning. +
Fuck! I had this amazing dream. +
My father and my ex-girlfriend were, like, dead or something. +
Hey, how you doing? +
It's good to see you. +
Coffee. I need coffee. +
Yeah, it's in the, in the kitchen. +
And I had these big hands! +
Like big aluminum hands. +
And I lived in this, like, big missile silo that was +
totally nuclear and it was surrounded by, like, +
my enemies and shit, and one by one, they'd run at me. +
I mean, they got inside somehow. +
I don't remember, but... +
they would like run at me +
and I would crush them to pieces with my big aluminum hands. +
I, like, I crushed this one guy. +
He had no face and stuff, but I crushed him. +
I could crush anything with these big fucking hands, man. +
-You don't have any coffee-- +
You don't have any coffee filters. +
Oh, I'll make that. That's alright. +
Oh! +
You were in the dream. +
As this beautiful unicorn woman +
with glass eyes. +
You, coffee. Me, bathroom. +
Yeah. That'd make a kick-ass song, wouldn't it? +
\N♪ Unicorn woman ♪ +
\N-Coffee. -♪ Ooo, ooo, ooo ♪ +
Oh, that's my roommate. +
Every fiber in my thirty-something being +
was screaming, "Get out. You're too old for this." +
And just when I thought I couldn't sink any lower... +
I need toilet paper! +
I'm just using the last of it to make the coffee. +
I decided the only way to break free was to move from one addiction +
to an even bigger one. +
Shoes. +
A couple of blocks and way too much money later, +
I realized I had just entered an interesting chapter in my life. +
I had outgrown the boys of my past +
and not quite grown into the men of my future. +
Hey! +
Hi. +
Hello. -Hi, how are ya? +
Why is it in a city of ten million men, +
you always see the one you don't want +
and never see the one you-- +
Hi. +
What are you doing down there? +
Oh, it's a wobbly table. +
Guess I have the touch. +
Would you care to join us? +
Hinge. +
-What? Your crossword puzzle. +
Five letter word, to bring together. Hinge. +
Well, nice seeing you. +
-Bye. -Bye. +
Excuse me. +
Uh, hey, just so you know, uh... +
I would have gotten "hinge" on my own. +
Maybe. +
I have no doubt. +
Now that I've got Jack hooked up, I'm single again. +
Maybe we could have dinner sometime? +
Hmm. I don't know. +
I'm good at crossword puzzles. +
I'm just not so good at people puzzles. +
Anywhere you want. +
Just you and me. +
Call me. +
As I walked away, +
maybe all men are a drug. +
Sometimes they bring you down +
and sometimes, like now, they get you so high. +
Damn... It would have been so cool if I hadn't looked back. +

\N我决定从沉沦中解脱 最好的方式 +
\N就是陷入另一个更大的欲望 +
\N也就是买鞋子 +
\N经过几条街和花了不少钱后 +
\N我了解我的人生 进入新的有趣的一章 +
\N我对过去的男孩来说太成熟 +
