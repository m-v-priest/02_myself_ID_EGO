== 南北战争

The most destructive 破坏性的，毁灭性的 war in America's history was fought among its own people.

[.my2]
美国历史上最具破坏性的战争, 是在自己的人民之间进行的。

The CIVIL WAR was a tragedy of unimaginable proportions 比例；倍数关系;面积；体积；规模；程度. +
For four long and bloody years, Americans were killed at the hands of 出自某人之手，由于某人 other Americans. +
One of every 25 American men perished (v.)死亡；毁灭 in the war. +
Over 640,000 soldiers were killed. +
Many civilians 平民 also died — in numbers often unrecorded.

[.my2]
内战是一场规模难以想象的悲剧。**在漫长而血腥的四年里，**美国人被其他美国人杀害。*每 25 名美国人中就有 1 人在战争中丧生。超过64万士兵阵亡。许多平民也死亡——死亡人数往往没有记录。*

At the battle of Antietam 河流名, more Americans were killed than on any other single day in all of American history. +
On that day, 22,719 soldiers fell to their deaths — four times the number of Americans lost during the D-Day assault on Normandy in WWII. +
In fact, more American soldiers died in the Civil War than in all other American wars combined.

[.my2]
在安提特姆战役中，阵亡的美国人比美国历史上任何一天都要多。那天，有 22,719 名士兵倒下身亡——是二战诺曼底诺曼底登陆日袭击中美国阵亡人数的四倍。*事实上，在内战中死亡的美国士兵, 比美国所有其他战争中死亡的士兵总和还要多。*


Four long years of battle changed everything.
No other event since the Revolutionary War `谓` altered the political, social, economic, and cultural fabric of the United States.
In the end, a predominantly 占主导地位地;主要地；多数情况下 industrial society triumphed over an agricultural one.  +
The Old South was forever changed.
The blemish 斑点；疤痕；瑕疵 of slavery was finally removed from American life, though 虽然，尽管 its legacy 遗产 would long linger.

[.my2]
四年漫长的战斗改变了一切。**自独立战争以来，没有任何其他事件改变了美国的政治、社会、经济和文化结构。最终，工业社会战胜了农业社会。老南方永远地改变了。奴隶制的污点终于从美国人的生活中消失了，**尽管它的遗产仍将长期存在。

=== Fort Sumter

began at Fort Sumter.

[.my2]
这一切都始于萨姆特堡。

On December 20, 1860, South Carolina seceded from the Union. +
Five days later, 68 federal troops stationed 驻扎，部署 in Charleston, South Carolina, withdrew to FORT 堡垒，要塞 SUMTER, an island in CHARLESTON HARBOR 港，海港.
The North considered the fort to be the property of the United States government. +
The people of South Carolina believed it belonged to the new Confederacy. +
Four months later, the first engagement 战斗；交战 of the Civil War took place on this disputed soil.

[.my2]
1860 年 12 月 20 日，"南卡罗来纳州"脱离联邦。五天后，驻扎在南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿的68名联邦军队, 撤至查尔斯顿港的"萨姆特堡岛屿"。**北方认为, 这座堡垒是美国政府的财产。南卡罗来纳州人民则相信, 它属于新的邦联。**四个月后，内战的第一次交战在这片有争议的土地上发生。

In February 1861, Jefferson Davis was inaugurated 为（某人）举行就职典礼;引进；开创；开始 as the provisional 临时的，暂时的 president of the Confederate States of America, in Montgomery, Alabama. +
On March 4,1861, Abraham Lincoln took his oath 誓言，誓约 of office as president of the Union in Washington, DC. +
The fate of Fort Sumter lay (v.) in the hands of these two leaders.

1861 年 2 月，杰斐逊·戴维斯, 在阿拉巴马州蒙哥马利就任"美利坚联盟国"临时总统。 1861 年 3 月 4 日，亚伯拉罕·林肯在华盛顿特区宣誓就任"联邦总统"。萨姆特堡的命运, 掌握在这两位领导人的手中。

====

As weeks passed, pressure grew for Lincoln to take some action on Fort Sumter and to reunite the states. +
Lincoln *thought of* the Southern secession *as* "artificial 人为的；非自然的." When Jefferson Davis sent a group of commissioners （委员会的）委员，专员，特派员 to Washington to negotiate for the transfer 搬迁；转移；调动；变换 of Fort Sumter to South Carolina, they were promptly rebuffed (v.)粗暴回绝；生硬的拒绝.

[.my2]
几周过去了，林肯面临的压力越来越大，要求他对萨姆特堡采取一些行动, 并重新统一各州。林肯认为, 南方分裂是“人为的”。当杰斐逊·戴维斯派出一组专员前往华盛顿, 就将萨姆特堡移交给南卡罗来纳州进行谈判时，他们立即遭到拒绝。

Lincoln had a dilemma （进退两难的）窘境，困境. +
Fort Sumter was running out of 用完，耗尽 supplies, but an attack on the fort would appear as Northern aggression. +
States that still remained part of the Union (such as Virginia and North Carolina) `谓` might be driven into the secessionist  (a.)赞成（或参与）脱离活动的；奉行分离主义的 camp. +
People at home and abroad might become sympathetic to the South. +
Yet Lincoln could not allow his troops to starve or surrender and risk (v.) showing considerable 相当大的，相当重要的 weakness.

[.my2]
**林肯陷入了两难的境地。萨姆特堡的补给即将耗尽，但对该堡的袭击将被视为北方对南方的侵略。这可能会导致当前仍然是联邦成员的州（例如弗吉尼亚州, 和北卡罗来纳州）可能会被赶入分裂主义阵营。**国内外人民可能会同情南方。然而林肯不能允许他的部队挨饿或投降，并冒着表现出相当虚弱的风险。



At last he developed a plan.
On April 6, Lincoln told the governor of South Carolina that he was going to send provisions 提供；供给；给养；供应品 to Fort Sumter. +
He would send no arms, troops, or ammunition 弹药，军火 — unless, of course, South Carolina attacked.

[.my2]
*最后他制定了一个计划。 4月6日，林肯告诉"南卡罗来纳州"州长，他将向"萨姆特堡"运送物资。他不会派遣任何武器、军队或弹药——当然，除非"南卡罗来纳州"发动袭击。*

Now the dilemma sat with Jefferson Davis. +
Attacking Lincoln's resupply 再供给；获得再补给 brigade （军队的）旅；队，派，帮 would make the South the aggressive party.
But he simply （强调某说法）确实，简直 could not allow the fort to be resupplied. +

[.my2]
现在，杰斐逊·戴维斯面临着两难的境地。**攻击林肯的补给旅, 将使南方成为侵略方。**但他根本不允许堡垒得到补给​​。


The Civil War began at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861, when Confederate artillery （统称）火炮,炮兵部队, under the command of GENERAL PIERRE GUSTAVE T. BEAUREGARD, opened fire on Fort Sumter. +
Confederate batteries showered (v.)（洗）淋浴;洒落；纷纷降落 the fort with over 3,000 shells 炮弹 in a three-and-a-half day period. +
Anderson surrendered. +
Ironically, Beauregard had developed his military skills under Anderson's instruction at West Point. +
This was the first of countless relationships and families devastated in the Civil War. +
The fight was on.

[.my2]
**内战于 1861 年 4 月 12 日凌晨 4 点 30 分开始，**当时南方邦联炮兵在皮埃尔·古斯塔夫·T·博勒加德将军的指挥下向萨姆特堡开火。 +
(中国: 1860年，英法联军进攻北京，烧毁圆明园. 签订《天津条约》及《北京条约》。)


Within days of the fall of Fort Sumter, four more states joined the Confederacy: Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. +
The battle lines were now drawn.

[.my2]
萨姆特堡陷落后的几天内，又有四个州加入了南方邦联：弗吉尼亚州、北卡罗来纳州、田纳西州和阿肯色州。战线现已划定。

=== 南北经济实力对比

On paper, the Union outweighed 超过，胜过 the Confederacy in almost every way. +
Nearly 21 million people lived in 23 Northern states. +
The South claimed just 9 million people — including 3.5 million slaves — in 11 CONFEDERATE STATES. +
Despite the North's greater population, however, the South had an army almost equal in size during the first year of the war.

[.my2]
**从纸面上看，联邦几乎在所有方面都超过了邦联。近 2100 万人居住在 23 个北方州。南方在 11 个邦联州中只拥有 900 万人，其中包括 350 万奴隶。**然而，尽管北方人口较多，*但南方在战争的第一年拥有一支几乎同等规模的军队。*

The North had an enormous industrial advantage as well. +
At the beginning of the war, the Confederacy had only one-ninth the industrial capacity of the Union. +
But that statistic was misleading. +

In 1860, the North manufactured (v.)制造，加工 97 percent of the country's firearms 火器，枪炮, 96 percent of its railroad locomotives 机车；火车头, 94 percent of its cloth, 93 percent of its pig iron 生铁；铸铁, and over 90 percent of its boots and shoes. +
The North had twice the density of railroads per square mile. +
There was not even one rifle works in the entire South.

[.my2]
*北方也拥有巨大的工业优势。战争开始时，南部邦联的工业能力仅为联邦的九分之一。但该统计数据具有误导性。*  1860年，北方生产了全国97%的枪支、96%的铁路机车、94%的布料、93%的生铁以及90%以上的靴子和鞋子。北方每平方英里的铁路密度是北方的两倍。整个南方连一处步枪工厂都没有。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.pig iron
[ U] a form of iron that is not pure 生铁；铸铁
====


The South was at a severe disadvantage 不利条件，劣势 when it came to manufacturing, but the Confederacy managed to keep its guns firing /by creating ammunition 弹药，军火 from melted-down bells from churches and town squares 城镇广场.

[.my2]
**南方在制造业方面处于严重劣势，**但联邦通过利用教堂和城镇广场熔化的钟, 来制造弹药，设法保持枪支能一直有弹药射击。

All of the principal 最重要的，首要的 ingredients 材料，原料 of GUNPOWDER were imported. +
Since the North controlled the navy, the seas were in the hands of the Union.
A blockade 封锁 could suffocate (v.)（使）窒息而死；（把…）闷死 the South.
Still, the Confederacy was not without resources and willpower 意志力，毅力.

[.my2]
**火药的所有主要成分都是进口的。由于北方控制了海军，海洋就掌握在联邦手中。封锁可能会让南方窒息。**尽管如此，联邦并非没有资源和意志力。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.suffocate
-> 来源于拉丁语中由前缀sub-(下)和fauces(咽喉,--英语faucal的词源)组成的复合动词suffocare的过去分词。 词根词缀： suf-下 + foc咽喉 + -ate动词词尾 同源词：faucal
====

The South could produce all the food it needed, though transporting it to soldiers and civilians was a major problem. +
The South also had a great nucleus of TRAINED OFFICERS. +
Seven of the eight military colleges in the country were in the South.

[.my2]
*南方可以生产所需的所有食物，但将其运送给士兵和平民是一个大问题。南方也有一支训练有素的军官队伍。全国八所军事院校中有七所位于南方。*

The South also proved to be very resourceful 足智多谋的，机敏的.
By the end of the war, it had established armories 军械库；兵工厂 and foundries 铸造厂；玻璃厂 in several states.
They built huge gunpowder mills 火药工厂 /and melted down thousands of church and plantation 种植园，种植场 bells for bronze  青铜 to build cannon.

[.my2]
事实证明，南方也非常足智多谋。战争结束时，它已在几个州建立了军械库和铸造厂。他们建造了巨大的火药厂，并熔化了数千个教堂和种植园的钟，以青铜制造大炮。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.foundry
a factory where metal or glass is melted and made into different shapes or objects 铸造厂；玻璃厂 +

image:/img/foundry.jpg[,10%]

====

The South's greatest strength lay (v.) in the fact that it was fighting on the defensive in its own territory. +
Familiar (v.) with the landscape, Southerners could harass Northern invaders.

[.my2]
*南方最大的优势在于, 它在自己的领土上进行防御性战斗。熟悉地形的南方人可以骚扰北方入侵者。*

The military and political objectives of the Union were much more difficult to accomplish.
The Union had to invade, conquer 攻克；征服, and occupy the South.
It had to destroy the South's capacity and will to resist — a formidable 可怕的；令人敬畏的；难对付的 challenge in any war.

[.my2]
北方联邦的军事和政治目标要实现起来要困难得多。联邦必须入侵、征服和占领南方。它必须摧毁南方的抵抗能力和意志——这在任何战争中都是一个巨大的挑战。



Southerners enjoyed the initial advantage of morale 士气，精神面貌: The South was fighting to maintain its way of life, whereas the North was fighting to maintain a union. +
Slavery did not become a moral cause of the Union effort until Lincoln announced the EMANCIPATION 解放 PROCLAMATION 宣言；宣布，公布 in 1863.

[.my2]
**南方人享有最初的士气优势：**南方为维持其生活方式(即拥有奴隶)而奋斗，*而北方则为维持联邦的存在而奋斗。直到 1863 年林肯宣布《奴隶制宣言》后，奴隶制才成为北方联邦努力的道德事业。 (也就是说, 一开始, 联邦是以维护"国家不解体"为目的, 来打败南方的. 直到林肯时, 才将"解放黑奴"加入打败南方的目的中.)*

When the war began, many key questions were still unanswered. +
What if the slave states of Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, and Delaware had joined the Confederacy? What if Britain or France had come to the aid of the South? What if a few decisive 决定性的；关键的 early Confederate victories had turned Northern public opinion against the war?

[.my2]
*战争开始时，许多关键问题仍未得到解答。如果马里兰州、肯塔基州、密苏里州和特拉华州等奴隶州, 加入了南方邦联会怎样？如果英国或法国援助南方怎么办？如果南部邦联早期的几场决定性胜利, 使北方公众舆论反对战争怎么办？*

Indeed, the North looked much better on paper.
But `主` many factors 后定 undetermined (a.)待定的；未确定的 at the outbreak of war `谓` could have tilted (v.)使倾斜 _the balance sheet_ 资产负债表 toward a different outcome.

[.my2]
事实上，北方在纸面上看起来要好得多。但**战争爆发时的许多不确定因素, 可能会使资产负债表的天平, 朝着不同的结果倾斜。**

=== The Battle of Bull Run / the Battle of Manassas Junction

When the war began in April 1861, most Americans expected the conflict to be brief.

[.my2]
*1861 年 4 月战争爆发时，大多数美国人(都持有人性中常见的乐观心态,)预计冲突会很短暂。*

When President Lincoln *called upon* the governors and states of the Union to furnish (v.)向（某人╱某事物）供应，提供;布置家具  him with 75,000 soldiers, he *asked for* an enlistment 征募，应征入伍 of only 90 days. +
When the Confederacy moved its capital to Richmond, Virginia, 100 miles from Washington, everyone expected a decisive battle to take place on the ground between the two cities.

[.my2]
当林肯总统呼吁联邦州长和各州, 向他提供 75,000 名士兵时，他只要求入伍 90 天。当南部邦联将首都迁至距华盛顿 100 英里的弗吉尼亚州"里士满"时，每个人都预计, 两座城市之间将只会发生一场决定性的战斗。

[.my1]

====

In the spring of 1861, 35,000 Confederate (a.)南部邦联的 troops led by General Pierre Beauregard moved north to protect Richmond against invasion. +
Lincoln's army had almost completed its 90-day enlistment requirement and still its field 实地；野外 commander, GENERAL IRVIN MCDOWELL, did not want to fight. +
Pressured to act, on July 18 (three months after the war had begun) McDowell marched his army of 37,000 into Virginia.

[.my2]
1861 年春，皮埃尔·博勒加德 (Pierre Beauregard) 将军率领 35,000 名南方邦联军队北上，保护"里士满"免受入侵。林肯的军队几乎已经完成了 90 天的入伍要求，但其战地指挥官"欧文·麦克道威尔"将军仍然不想参加战斗。迫于(受到林肯总统要求)采取行动的压力，"麦克道尔"于 7 月 18 日（战争开始三个月后）率领 37,000 人的军队进入弗吉尼亚。


Naming Battles

[.my2]
命名之战

The Battle of Bull Run was also known as the Battle of Manassas Junction. +
Frequently, major battles had two names.
The South named battles after the nearby cities.
The North named them after the nearby waterways.

[.my2]
"布尔朗战役"也被称为"马纳萨斯枢纽战役"。*重大战役常常有两个名称。南方以附近的城市命名战争。北方以附近的水道命名它们。*

.案例
====
.The Battle of Bull Run / First Battle of Manassas
第一次布尔朗战役，被南方联盟军队称为第一次马纳萨斯战役 ，是美国内战的第一场重大战役。这场战斗于 1861 年 7 月 21 日在弗吉尼亚州, 威廉王子县打响，该县位于马纳萨斯市以北，距离华盛顿特区西南偏西约 30 英里。联邦军部署缓慢，让南方联盟增援部队有时间到达乘铁路。双方都有大约 18,000 名训练有素、领导不善的军队。这场战斗是南方联盟的胜利，随后联邦军队在战后撤退。

image:/img/First Battle of Manassas.jpg[,100%]
====



Over 4,800 soldiers were killed, wounded, or listed as missing from both armies in the battle. +
The next day, Lincoln named MAJOR GENERAL 陆军少将；（美）空军少将 GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN to command the new ARMY OF THE POTOMAC 河名 and signed legislation for the enlistment 征募，应征入伍 of one million troops to last (v.) three years.

[.my2]
双方军队共有 4,800 多名士兵在战斗中阵亡、受伤或失踪。第二天，**林肯**任命"乔治·B·麦克莱伦"少将, 指挥新的"波托马克军团"，*并签署了征募 100 万军队的法案，为期三年。*

The high _esprit (n.)精神抖擞 de corps_  团队精神,集体荣誉感 of the Confederates was elevated 提高，使升高 by their victory. +
For the North, which had supremacy 至高无上；最大权力；最高权威；最高地位 in numbers, it increased their caution 小心，谨慎. +
Seven long months passed before McClellan agreed to fight. +
Meanwhile, Lincoln was growing impatient at the timidity 胆怯，胆小，羞怯 of his generals.

[.my2]
南方联盟军的高度士气, 因他们的胜利而得到提升。对于数量上占优势的北方来说，这增加了他们的谨慎。*漫长的七个月过去了，麦克莱伦才同意参战。与此同时，林肯对他的将军们的胆怯越来越不耐烦。*

[.my1]
.案例
====
.esprit de corps
是一个法语短语，意思是“团队精神”或“集体荣誉感”。“de” 在法语中是“的”的意思，用来连接 “esprit” 和 “corps”。整句话的意思是：“南方邦联军队的团队精神, 因他们的取胜而得到提升。”
====


In many ways, the Civil War represented a transition 过渡，转变 from the old style of fighting to the new style. +
During Bull Run and other early engagements 战斗；交战, `主` traditional uniformed lines of troops `谓` faced off 对峙，对抗, each trying to outflank (v.)包抄；侧翼包围 the other. +
As the war progressed 进步，发展, new weapons and tactics 策略；手段；招数;战术；兵法; changed warfare forever. +
There were no civilian spectators 平民观众 during the destructive battles to come.

[.my2]
**从很多方面来说，内战代表了从旧的战斗方式, 到新的战斗方式的转变。**在布尔朗和其他早期交战中，传统的制服部队对峙，双方都试图从侧翼包抄对方。**随着战争的进展，新的武器和战术永远改变了战争。**在接下来的破坏性战斗中没有平民观众。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.outflank
(v.)to move around the side of an enemy or opponent, especially in order to attack them from behind 包抄；侧翼包围 +
-> out-,向外，flank,边，侧翼。引申词义包抄。

=== Battle of Antietam 安蒂特姆之战

The Civil War was fought with awe-inspiring 使人敬畏的；令人惊叹的  passion.

[.my2]
内战是在令人敬畏的激情中进行的。

On the Union side, President Lincoln believed that `主` failure to preserve the Union `系` was a betrayal of the founders of the republic and the promise of the Declaration of Independence. +
He would not see it "perish 死亡；暴死;丧失；湮灭；毁灭 from this earth."

[.my2]
在联邦方面，林肯总统认为，未能维护联邦, 就是对共和国创始人和《独立宣言》承诺的背叛。他(指林肯)绝不会看到它“从地球上消失”。

Passions raged (v.)发怒；狂暴 as hot in the South. +
Like Lincoln, Jefferson Davis also believed in the Declaration of Independence. +
He insisted that governments existed with the consent of _the governed_ 被统治者. +
Northern interference with _popular Southern law_ `系`  was an affront 侮辱；冒犯 to this ideals.

[.my2]
在南方，激情同样炽热。和林肯一样，杰斐逊·戴维斯(南方邦联的总统)也相信《独立宣言》。他坚持认为政府的存在必须得到被统治者的同意。北方对南方流行法律的干涉, 是对这一理想的侮辱。

[.my1]

ROBERT E. LEE, who did not favor (v.) secession, felt that the North was seeking to wrest (v.)攫取，抢夺（权力） from the South its dearest 最亲爱的 rights.

[.my2]
"罗伯特·E·李"不赞成分裂国家，他认为北方正在寻求从南方夺取其最珍贵的权利。


Many Southerners believed the Northern position was an outright 完全的，彻底的 attack on the Southern way of life. +
They observed 观察；注意到 that `主` the poverty suffered by Northern industrial workers `谓` created living conditions worse than those endured (v.)忍耐 by Southern slaves. +
They also cited the Bible in defense of plantation life.

[.my2]
许多南方人认为, 北方的立场是对南方生活方式的公然攻击。他们观察到，北方工业工人遭遇的贫困, 创造了一种生活条件, 要比南方奴隶所忍受的还要差。他们还引用圣经来捍卫种植园生活。

Southern legalists 法律学家 believed that the North was undermining (v.)从根基处破坏；挖…的墙脚;逐渐削弱（信心、权威等）；使逐步减少效力 the original intent 意图；意向；目的 of the Founding Fathers. +
The cornerstone 基石，支柱 of the American system was the state government, for which Confederates believed the Northerners had little respect.

[.my2]
南方法家认为, 北方正在破坏开国元勋的初衷。美国制度的基石是"州政府"，南方邦联认为, 北方人对"州政府"缺乏尊重。


South was on the move.

[.my2]
南方正在行动。

In August 1862, a Confederate Army invaded Kentucky from Tennessee.
They seized FRANKFORT and seated a Confederate governor. +
During that same month, Robert E. Lee's ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA had defeated the Union Army again at the SECOND BATTLE OF BULL RUN.

[.my2]
1862 年 8 月，南方联盟军队从"田纳西州", 入侵"肯塔基州"。他们占领了法兰克福, 并任命了一位南部邦联州长。同月，罗伯特·E·李的北弗吉尼亚陆军, 在第二次"奔牛战役"中再次击败了联邦军。

Lee and Jefferson Davis believed that one more successful campaign might bring British and French recognition of the Confederacy. +
Foreign powers are reluctant to enter a conflict on the losing side. +
Although Britain and France both saw advantages of a split United States, neither country was willing to support the Confederacy without being convinced the South could win. +
Lee and Davis were desperately seeking that decisive victory.

[.my2]
李将军和杰佛逊·戴维斯相信，*一场更成功的军事上的战役, 可能会让英国和法国承认南方邦联。外国势力不愿意站在失败者一方。尽管英国和法国都看到了"美国分裂"对它们的好处，但在没有确信南方能够获胜的情况下，这两个国家都不愿意支持邦联。因此, 李和戴维斯, 拼命地寻求决定性的军事胜利。(即成王败寇, 用事实说话)*

Lee wanted to attack the North on its own territory. +
His target was the federal rail center at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but the Union General George McClellan was pursuing him. +
Lee decided to stop and confront the Union Army at SHARPSBURG, Maryland. +
In front of the town ran a little creek 小溪；小海湾 called Antietam.

[.my2]
李想在北方自己的领土上来攻击北方。他的目标是宾夕法尼亚州"哈里斯堡"的联邦铁路中心，但联邦将军"乔治·麦克莱伦"正在追击他。李决定在马里兰州"夏普斯堡"停下来, 与联邦军对峙。镇前有一条小溪，名叫安蒂特姆（Antietam）。

.Battle of Antietam 安蒂特姆战役
是1862年9月17日, 发生在华盛顿郡的马里兰会战中的一场战役。两军合计约损失23,000人，是美国史上最血腥的“一日战役”。北军获得战略上的胜利，阻止南军"北维吉尼亚军团"入侵"马里兰州"，但是，北军波多马克军团也损失惨重，因此罗伯特·李得以撤回维吉尼亚州。 +
战后，由于北军阻止南军继续北进，林肯总统因此决定发表解放奴隶宣言。

This day sits in history as the bloodiest single day America has ever suffered. +
Over 22,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing — more than all such casualties 伤亡人员；受害者 during the entire American Revolution. +
Lee lost a quarter of his army; the survivors headed (v.)朝（某方向）行进 back to Virginia the next night.

[.my2]
这一天被载入史册，成为美国遭受过的最血腥的一天。超过 22,000 名士兵阵亡、受伤或失踪——比整个美国革命期间的所有此类伤亡人数还要多。李损失了四分之一的军队；第二天晚上，幸存者返回弗吉尼亚。

The horror 震惊；恐惧；厌恶 of Antietam proved to be one of the war's critical 极其重要的，关键的 events.
Lee and Davis did not get their victory.
Neither Britain nor France was prepared to recognize the Confederacy. +
Five days after the battle, Lincoln issued his preliminary 初步的，预备的 Emancipation 解放 Proclamation.
On November 5, Lincoln, impatient with McClellan's hesitancy (n.)踌躇，犹豫, *relieved* 开除；解除…的职务 him *of* command, and replaced him with GENERAL AMBROSE BURNSIDE.

[.my2]
安提特姆的之战, 被证明是这场内战的关键事件之一。李和戴维斯没有获得胜利。英国和法国都不准备承认南部邦联。战斗结束五天后，林肯发布了初步的《解放奴隶宣言》。 11 月 5 日，林肯对"麦克莱伦"的犹豫不决感到不耐烦，解除了他的指挥权，并由"安布罗斯·伯恩赛德"将军取而代之。

Antietam changed everything.

[.my2]
安提坦改变了一切。

=== 南北方的著名将领

The battles that caused the loss of so much life in the Civil War `系` were the results of decisions made by the military commanders of the North and the South. +
Who were these people? Why did they order (v.) the kinds of attacks that characterized (v.) this war? How could they follow orders that in many cases seemed like sheer (a.)（用于强调）纯粹的，完全的 suicide? Many of the opposing officers were actually friends, who had been classmates at West Point and having fought (v.) at each other's sides in the US-MEXICAN WAR OF 1848.

南北战争中造成如此多人员伤亡的战斗, 是南北军事指挥官决策的结果。这些人是谁？他们为什么要发动这场战争所特有的攻击行动？他们怎么能服从在许多情况下看起来纯粹是自杀的命令呢？许多敌对军官实际上是朋友，他们曾是西点军校的同学，并在 1848 年的美墨战争中并肩作战。

=== 北方最后的统一南方


Only one day after their victory at Gettysburg, Union forces captured Vicksburg, the last Confederate stronghold 堡垒；要塞；据点 on the Mississippi River. +
Lincoln and Union commanders began to make plans for finishing the war.

[.my2]
在葛底斯堡获胜仅一天后，联邦军队就占领了密西西比河上最后一个南部邦联据点"维克斯堡"。林肯和联邦指挥官开始制定结束战争的计划。

The Union strategy to win the war did not emerge all at once.
By 1863, however, the Northern military plan `谓` consisted of five major goals:

[.my2]
*北方联邦赢得战争的战略, 并不是一下子就出现的。然而，到 1863 年，北方军事计划包含五个主要目标：*

1.Fully blockade all Southern coasts. +
This strategy, known as the ANACONDA PLAN, would eliminate the possibility of Confederate help from abroad.

[.my2]
*全面封锁南部海岸。这一战略被称为“蟒蛇计划”，将消除南方邦联从国外获得帮助的可能性。*


[.my1]
.案例
====
.The Anaconda Plan
该计划由联邦总司令温菲尔德·斯科特提出，强调联邦对南部港口的封锁，并要求沿密西西比河推进，将南部一分为二。

首先，严格封锁脱离国家的所有港口。 +
其次，一支大约80,000人的强大纵队应该利用密西西比河作为高速公路，彻底突破南部邦联。迅速前进，依次占领河下游的南方联盟阵地。最终的战斗将是争夺新奥尔良下方的堡垒。当它们倒下时，这条河从源头到河口都将落入美国手中，叛乱将被一分为二。

image:/img/Anaconda Plan.jpg[,30%]

1861年4月亚伯拉罕·林肯总统宣布，为了切断南方联邦的对外经贸往来，对大西洋沿岸和墨西哥湾沿岸长达5,600公里的海岸线，其中包括对新奥尔良和莫比尔等12个主要港口进行封锁。

面对要封锁5600公里的漫长海岸线, 以及180个需要监视巡逻的口岸，这是美国建国以来对海军的最大挑战。因此扩充北方联邦的海军成为当务之急。到战争结束时，北方联邦海军成为世界上最大的海军。

随着美国最大港口新奥尔良的海路被北军封锁，南方依靠走私船突破封锁变得益发困难。 +
海上封锁对北军来说是一个有效的武器，*与陆地战场相比，海面封锁以较少的生命代价就可以给破坏南方的经济。 封锁几乎完全扼杀了南方棉花的出口，棉花出口下降了95％。而棉花出口是南方邦联赚取硬通货的赖以生存之道。封锁还大大减少了食品，药品，战争物资，制成品和奢侈品的进口。*

**海路封锁除了切断南方与英国的棉花贸易以外，也造成了南方联邦的粮食供应失衡。**南方的粮食产地还可以自给自足，但是却无法将粮食运送到非粮产地的地方，特别是战争后期，罗伯特·李将军的军需补给线经常中断。 +
**海路交通受阻，对南方联邦来说，长距离运输只能依靠南方的铁路线，但是它无法弥补海路封锁造成的损失。**这导致了严重的商品短缺和通货膨胀。 +

**在1863年前，牲畜运输队还可以在陆路畅通无阻，但在1863年夏天北军夺取了密西西比河的控制权之后，德克萨斯州和阿肯色州的猪马牛等牲畜, 就无法再运送到东部地区，**实施“蟒蛇计划”是北方联邦赢得南北战争的重要因素。

*对英国来说，北方联邦对南方联邦实施封锁，使南方的棉花出口受阻，影响了英国国内的棉纺产业。* +
18世纪和19世纪的工业革命期间，棉纺业是英国的重要产业。为了向英国施加压力以支持美国南方，南方政府曾禁止所有的棉花出口。然而当南方政府意识到这个政策无效时，北方的封锁已经有效地阻止了大部分棉花离开南方。封锁南方港口被认为会给英国的经济带来沉重打击. 原料来源中断, 棉纺厂无米下锅，工厂被迫关闭，工人大量失业。

南北分裂后，南方想方设法争取国际上对它的外交承认，而北方对此则竭力阻止。

2.Control the Mississippi River. +
The river was the South's major inland waterway. +
Also, Northern control of the rivers would separate Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas from the other Confederate states.

[.my2]
*控制密西西比河。这条河是南方主要的内陆水道。此外，北方对河流的控制, 能使德克萨斯州、路易斯安那州, 和阿肯色州, 与其他南部邦联各州分开。*

3.Capture RICHMOND. +
Without its capital, the Confederacy's command lines would be disrupted.

[.my2]
*占领南方邦联的首都"里士满"。没有首都，南部邦联的指挥线就会被打乱。*

4.Shatter (v.)（使）破碎，碎裂 Southern civilian morale 士气，精神面貌 by capturing and destroying ATLANTA, SAVANNAH, and the heart of Southern secession, South Carolina.

英语单词infantry（步兵）与infant（婴儿）的拼写非常接近，它们之间有何关系呢？infans由in（不）+fans（说话）组成，意思是不能说话，所以infantem指的是还不会说话的婴儿。infant（婴儿）直接来自infantem，而infantry（步兵）来自infantem所衍生的infante（新手）。

中世纪的欧洲，骑兵需要专业训练，通常只有贵族才能充当骑士。骑士是打小就接受专业的军事训练的。而步兵通常都是从平民中临时征募的，所以战斗经验远远逊于骑兵。所以与骑兵相比，步兵就像是还不会说话的婴儿。

The most destructive war in America's history was fought among its own people.

The CIVIL WAR was a tragedy of unimaginable proportions. For four long and bloody years, Americans were killed at the hands of other Americans. One of every 25 American men perished in the war. Over 640,000 soldiers were killed. Many civilians also died — in numbers often unrecorded.

At the battle of Antietam, more Americans were killed than on any other single day in all of American history. On that day, 22,719 soldiers fell to their deaths — four times the number of Americans lost during the D-Day assault on Normandy in WWII. In fact, more American soldiers died in the Civil War than in all other American wars combined.


Four long years of battle changed everything. No other event since the Revolutionary War altered the political, social, economic, and cultural fabric of the United States. In the end, a predominantly industrial society triumphed over an agricultural one. The Old South was forever changed. The blemish of slavery was finally removed from American life, though its legacy would long linger.

'''

=== Fort Sumter

began at Fort Sumter.

On December 20, 1860, South Carolina seceded from the Union. Five days later, 68 federal troops stationed in Charleston, South Carolina, withdrew to FORT SUMTER, an island in CHARLESTON HARBOR. The North considered the fort to be the property of the United States government. The people of South Carolina believed it belonged to the new Confederacy. Four months later, the first engagement of the Civil War took place on this disputed soil.



In February 1861, Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as the provisional president of the Confederate States of America, in Montgomery, Alabama. On March 4,1861, Abraham Lincoln took his oath of office as president of the Union in Washington, DC. The fate of Fort Sumter lay in the hands of these two leaders.

As weeks passed, pressure grew for Lincoln to take some action on Fort Sumter and to reunite the states. Lincoln thought of the Southern secession as "artificial." When Jefferson Davis sent a group of commissioners to Washington to negotiate for the transfer of Fort Sumter to South Carolina, they were promptly rebuffed.

Lincoln had a dilemma. Fort Sumter was running out of supplies, but an attack on the fort would appear as Northern aggression. States that still remained part of the Union (such as Virginia and North Carolina) might be driven into the secessionist camp. People at home and abroad might become sympathetic to the South. Yet Lincoln could not allow his troops to starve or surrender and risk showing considerable weakness.



At last he developed a plan. On April 6, Lincoln told the governor of South Carolina that he was going to send provisions to Fort Sumter. He would send no arms, troops, or ammunition — unless, of course, South Carolina attacked.

Now the dilemma sat with Jefferson Davis. Attacking Lincoln's resupply brigade would make the South the aggressive party. But he simply could not allow the fort to be resupplied. J.G. GILCHRIST, a Southern newspaper writer, warned, "Unless you sprinkle the blood in the face of the people of Alabama, they will be back in the old Union in less than ten days."


The Civil War began at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861, when Confederate artillery, under the command of GENERAL PIERRE GUSTAVE T. BEAUREGARD, opened fire on Fort Sumter. Confederate batteries showered the fort with over 3,000 shells in a three-and-a-half day period. Anderson surrendered. Ironically, Beauregard had developed his military skills under Anderson's instruction at West Point. This was the first of countless relationships and families devastated in the Civil War. The fight was on.


Within days of the fall of Fort Sumter, four more states joined the Confederacy: Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. The battle lines were now drawn.

'''

=== 南北经济实力对比

On paper, the Union outweighed the Confederacy in almost every way. Nearly 21 million people lived in 23 Northern states. The South claimed just 9 million people — including 3.5 million slaves — in 11 CONFEDERATE STATES. Despite the North's greater population, however, the South had an army almost equal in size during the first year of the war.

The North had an enormous industrial advantage as well. At the beginning of the war, the Confederacy had only one-ninth the industrial capacity of the Union. But that statistic was misleading. In 1860, the North manufactured 97 percent of the country's firearms, 96 percent of its railroad locomotives, 94 percent of its cloth, 93 percent of its pig iron, and over 90 percent of its boots and shoes. The North had twice the density of railroads per square mile. There was not even one rifleworks in the entire South.

Civil War artillery
The South was at a severe disadvantage when it came to manufacturing, but the Confederacy managed to keep its guns firing by creating ammunition from melted-down bells from churches and town squares.

All of the principal ingredients of GUNPOWDER were imported. Since the North controlled the navy, the seas were in the hands of the Union. A blockade could suffocate the South. Still, the Confederacy was not without resources and willpower.

The South could produce all the food it needed, though transporting it to soldiers and civilians was a major problem. The South also had a great nucleus of TRAINED OFFICERS. Seven of the eight military colleges in the country were in the South.

The South also proved to be very resourceful. By the end of the war, it had established armories and foundries in several states. They built huge gunpowder mills and melted down thousands of church and plantation bells for bronze to build cannon.

The South's greatest strength lay in the fact that it was fighting on the defensive in its own territory. Familiar with the landscape, Southerners could harass Northern invaders.

The military and political objectives of the Union were much more difficult to accomplish. The Union had to invade, conquer, and occupy the South. It had to destroy the South's capacity and will to resist — a formidable challenge in any war.



Southerners enjoyed the initial advantage of morale: The South was fighting to maintain its way of life, whereas the North was fighting to maintain a union. Slavery did not become a moral cause of the Union effort until Lincoln announced the EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION in 1863.

When the war began, many key questions were still unanswered. What if the slave states of Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, and Delaware had joined the Confederacy? What if Britain or France had come to the aid of the South? What if a few decisive early Confederate victories had turned Northern public opinion against the war?

Indeed, the North looked much better on paper. But many factors undetermined at the outbreak of war could have tilted the balance sheet toward a different outcome.


'''

=== The Battle of Bull Run

When the war began in April 1861, most Americans expected the conflict to be brief.

When President Lincoln called upon the governors and states of the Union to furnish him with 75,000 soldiers, he asked for an enlistment of only 90 days. When the Confederacy moved its capital to Richmond, Virginia, 100 miles from Washington, everyone expected a decisive battle to take place on the ground between the two cities.

In the spring of 1861, 35,000 Confederate troops led by General Pierre Beauregard moved north to protect Richmond against invasion. Lincoln's army had almost completed its 90-day enlistment requirement and still its field commander, GENERAL IRVIN MCDOWELL, did not want to fight. Pressured to act, on July 18 (three months after the war had begun) McDowell marched his army of 37,000 into Virginia.


Naming Battles

The Battle of Bull Run was also known as the Battle of Manassas Junction. Frequently, major battles had two names. The South named battles after the nearby cities. The North named them after the nearby waterways.



Over 4,800 soldiers were killed, wounded, or listed as missing from both armies in the battle. The next day, Lincoln named MAJOR GENERAL GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN to command the new ARMY OF THE POTOMAC and signed legislation for the enlistment of one million troops to last three years.

The high esprit de corps of the Confederates was elevated by their victory. For the North, which had supremacy in numbers, it increased their caution. Seven long months passed before McClellan agreed to fight. Meanwhile, Lincoln was growing impatient at the timidity of his generals.

In many ways, the Civil War represented a transition from the old style of fighting to the new style. During Bull Run and other early engagements, traditional uniformed lines of troops faced off, each trying to outflank the other. As the war progressed, new weapons and tactics changed warfare forever. There were no civilian spectators during the destructive battles to come.

'''

=== Battle of Antietam

The Civil War was fought with awe-inspiring passion.

On the Union side, President Lincoln believed that failure to preserve the Union was a betrayal of the founders of the republic and the promise of the Declaration of Independence. He would not see it "perish from this earth."

Passions raged as hot in the South. Like Lincoln, Jefferson Davis also believed in the Declaration of Independence. He insisted that governments existed with the consent of the governed. Northern interference with popular Southern law was an affront to this ideals.


ROBERT E. LEE, who did not favor secession, felt that the North was seeking to wrest from the South its dearest rights.


Many Southerners believed the Northern position was an outright attack on the Southern way of life. They observed that the poverty suffered by Northern industrial workers created living conditions worse than those endured by Southern slaves. They also cited the Bible in defense of plantation life.

Southern legalists believed that the North was undermining the original intent of the Founding Fathers. The cornerstone of the American system was the state government, for which Confederates believed the Northerners had little respect.


South was on the move.

In August 1862, a Confederate Army invaded Kentucky fromTennesseeKentucky Tennessee. They seized FRANKFORT and seated a Confederate governor. During that same month, Robert E. Lee's ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA had defeated the Union Army again at the SECOND BATTLE OF BULL RUN.




Lee and Jefferson Davis believed that one more successful campaign might bring British and French recognition of the Confederacy. Foreign powers are reluctant to enter a conflict on the losing side. Although Britain and France both saw advantages of a split United States, neither country was willing to support the Confederacy without being convinced the South could win. Lee and Davis were desperately seeking that decisive victory.

Lee wanted to attack the North on its own territory. His target was the federal rail center at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but the Union General George McClellan was pursuing him. Lee decided to stop and confront the Union Army at SHARPSBURG, Maryland. In front of the town ran a little creek called Antietam.



This day sits in history as the bloodiest single day America has ever suffered. Over 22,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing — more than all such casualties during the entire American Revolution. Lee lost a quarter of his army; the survivors headed back to Virginia the next night.

The horror of Antietam proved to be one of the war's critical events. Lee and Davis did not get their victory. Neither Britain nor France was prepared to recognize the Confederacy. Five days after the battle, Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. On November 5, Lincoln, impatient with McClellan's hesitancy, relieved him of command, and replaced him with GENERAL AMBROSE BURNSIDE.

Antietam changed everything.


'''

=== 南北方的著名将领

The battles that caused the loss of so much life in the Civil War were the results of decisions made by the military commanders of the North and the South. Who were these people? Why did they order the kinds of attacks that characterized this war? How could they follow orders that in many cases seemed like sheer suicide? Many of the opposing officers were actually friends, who had been classmates at West Point and having fought at each other's sides in the US-MEXICAN WAR OF 1848.

Robert E. Lee was offered the position of commander in chief of the Union Army by President Lincoln before Virginia seceded from the United States. Lee was born into one of the South's most prominent families, and was the son of a Revolutionary War hero. His wife was the granddaughter of Martha Washington.



Lee did not favor either slavery or secession, but joined the Confederate army out of duty to Virginia, which he would not dishonor. Although he was the unquestioned military leader of the South, he was not given charge of the entire Confederate Army until the war's outcome had already been decided. He was a brilliant military strategist, continually outsmarting and defeating opponents with armies much larger than his own.


Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson was an intensely religious man. A former teacher at Virginia Military Institute, he believed the Southern cause was sacred. He was totally fearless in battle. He would drive troops to the point of total exhaustion, seemingly insensitive to their hardship and suffering.


After Jackson won five battles in one month, an aura of invincibility surrounded him. It lasted until his death, in the spring of 1863, during one of his most dramatic victories, the BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE.

The Union had outstanding officers, but for the first three years of the war, the Union Army had five different commanders. As Lincoln grew impatient with each one's caution or inflexibility, he'd replace him. They simply did not win the decisive battle that Lincoln needed. ULYSSES S. GRANT was chosen as the general who could finish the job. He had fought in the US-Mexican War and won battles at FORT HENRY and FORT DONELSON in Tennessee during the winter of 1862. Grant had also led the Union troops during the pivotal VICKSBURG VICTORY.



For his strategy in those battles, he earned the nickname "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER" GRANT. After he became commander in chief of the Union Army, he doggedly pursued Lee. Grant fought Lee measure for measure and continued to advance, even as Union casualties soared and despite suffering great criticism for those losses.



Grant's most trusted officer, WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN, had fought with Grant earlier in the war. Sherman's job was to take Atlanta, an action that was a key part of Lincoln's strategy to conclude the war.



Sherman was a nervous, talkative master strategist, who understood how difficult the war was going to be to win. He felt that the North would have to make life very difficult on civilians in the South in order to weaken the resolve of the Confederate Army. His ruthless and destructive drives across the South — first to Atlanta, then to the sea at Savannah, and finally through South Carolina, are his legacy.

'''

===  Battle of Gettysburg


Robert E. Lee had a vision.

He proposed to take the offensive, invade Pennsylvania, and defeat the Union Army in its own territory. Such a victory would relieve Virginia of the burden of war, strengthen the hand of PEACE DEMOCRATS in the North, and undermine Lincoln's chances for reelection. It would reopen the possibility for European support that was closed at Antietam. And perhaps, it would even lead to peace.

The result of this vision was the largest battle ever fought on the North American continent. This was GETTYSBURG, where more than 170,000 fought and over 40,000 were casualties.


Few Confederates made it. Lee's attempt for a decisive victory in Pennsylvania had failed. He had lost 28,000 troops — one-third of his army. A month later, he offered his resignation to Jefferson Davis, which was refused. Meade had lost 23,000 soldiers.

The hope for Southern recognition by any foreign government was dashed. The war continued for two more years, but Gettysburg marked the end of Lee's major offensives. The Confederacy tottered toward its defeat.


'''

=== 北方最后的统一南方


Only one day after their victory at Gettysburg, Union forces captured Vicksburg, the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. Lincoln and Union commanders began to make plans for finishing the war.

The Union strategy to win the war did not emerge all at once. By 1863, however, the Northern military plan consisted of five major goals:

1.Fully blockade all Southern coasts. This strategy, known as the ANACONDA PLAN, would eliminate the possibility of Confederate help from abroad.

2.Control the Mississippi River. The river was the South's major inland waterway. Also, Northern control of the rivers would separate Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas from the other Confederate states.



3.Capture RICHMOND. Without its capital, the Confederacy's command lines would be disrupted.

4.Shatter Southern civilian morale by capturing and destroying ATLANTA, SAVANNAH, and the heart of Southern secession, South Carolina.

5.Use the numerical advantage of Northern troops to engage the enemy everywhere to break the spirits of the Confederate Army.




By early 1864, the first two goals had been accomplished. The blockade had successfully prevented any meaningful foreign aid. General Ulysses Grant's success at Vicksburg delivered the Mississippi River to the Union. Lincoln turned to Grant to finish the job and, in the spring of 1864, appointed Grant to command the entire Union Army.

Grant had a plan to end the war by November. He mounted several major simultaneous offensives. General George Meade was to lead the Union's massive Army of the Potomac against Robert E. Lee. Grant would stay with Meade, who commanded the largest Northern army. GENERAL JAMES BUTLER was to advance up the JAMES RIVER in Virginia and attack Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy. General William Tecumseh Sherman was to plunge into the heart of the South, inflicting as much damage as he could against their war resources.


One week after Abraham Lincoln's reelection in 1864, William Tecumseh Sherman (above) began his merciless march through Georgia, leaving nothing behind but civilian sorrow and scorched earth. Both Atlanta and Savannah would fall back to Union control during this campaign.


Meade faced Lee's army in Virginia. Lee's strategy was to use terrain and fortified positions to his advantage, thus decreasing the importance of the Union's superiority in numbers. He hoped to make the cost of trying to force the South back into the Union so high that the Northern public would not stand for it. He almost accomplished this. From May 5 to May 24, the full force of Grant's and Lee's armies fought continually with enormous casualties.

But, unlike the Union commanders of the past, Grant had the determination to press on despite the cost. Twenty-eight thousand soldiers were casualties of the BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS. A few days later, another 28,000 soldiers were casualties in the BATTLE OF SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE. More than two-thirds of the casualties of these battles were Union soldiers.

.Battle of Wilderness


It was the first battle of Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Virginia Overland Campaign against General Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. The fighting occurred in a wooded area near Locust Grove, Virginia, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Fredericksburg. Both armies suffered heavy casualties, nearly 29,000 in total, a harbinger of a war of attrition by Grant against Lee's army and, eventually, the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia. The battle was tactically inconclusive, as Grant disengaged and continued his offensive.

.案例

.Battle of Spotsylvania Court House

The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, sometimes more simply referred to as the Battle of Spotsylvania (or the 19th-century spelling Spottsylvania), was the second major battle in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's 1864 Overland Campaign of the American Civil War. Following the bloody but inconclusive Battle of the Wilderness, Grant's army disengaged from Confederate General Robert E. Lee's army and moved to the southeast, attempting to lure Lee into battle under more favorable conditions. Elements of Lee's army beat the Union army to the critical crossroads of the Spotsylvania Court House in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, and began entrenching. Fighting occurred on and off from May 8 through May 21, 1864, as Grant tried various schemes to break the Confederate line. In the end, the battle was tactically inconclusive, but both sides declared victory. The Confederacy declared victory because they were able to hold their defenses. The United States declared victory because the Federal offensive continued and Lee's army suffered losses that could not be replaced. With almost 32,000 casualties on both sides, Spotsylvania was the costliest battle of the campaign.

====

At COLD HARBOR the following week, Grant lost another 13,000 soldiers — 7,000 of them in half an hour. In the 30 days that Grant had been fighting Lee, he lost 50,000 troops — a number equal to half the size of the Confederate army at the time. As a result, Grant became known as "THE BUTCHER." Congress was appalled and petitioned for his removal. But Lincoln argued that Grant was winning the battles and refused to grant Congress's request.



William T. Sherman's ruthless march through the South to the sea drove a stake into the heart of the Confederacy. He left nothing in his wake, destroying everything in sight in an attempt to crush the rebellion once and for all.

Butler failed to capture Richmond, and the Confederate capital was temporarily spared. On May 6, one day after Grant and Lee started their confrontation in the Wilderness, Sherman entered Georgia, scorching whatever resources that lay in his path. By late July, he had forced the enemy back to within sight of Atlanta. For a month, he lay siege to the city. Finally, in early September he entered Atlanta — one day after the Confederate army evacuated it.

Sherman waited until seven days after Lincoln's hotly fought reelection before putting Atlanta to the torch and starting his MARCH TO THE SEA. No one stood before him. His soldiers pillaged the countryside and destroyed everything of conceivable military value as they traveled 285 miles to Savannah in a march that became legendary for the misery it created among the civilian population. On December 22, Savannah fell.


Next, Sherman ordered his army to move north into South Carolina. Their intent was to destroy the state where secession began. Exactly a month later, its capital, Columbia, fell to him. On the same day, Union Forces retook Fort Sumter.




The war was almost over.



The end was in sight.

Only Lee's Army of Northern Virginia remained as a substantial military force to oppose the Union Army. For nine months, Grant and Lee had faced each other from 53 miles of trenches during the SIEGE OF PETERSBURG. Lee's forces had been reduced to 50,000, while Grant's had grown to over 120,000.

The Southern troops began to melt away as the end became clear. On April 2, Grant ordered an attack on Petersburg and broke the Confederate line. Lee and his shrinking army were able to escape.

Lee sent a message to Jefferson Davis saying that Richmond could no longer be defended and that he should evacuate the city. That night Jefferson Davis and his cabinet set fire to everything of military value in Richmond, then boarded a train to Danville, 140 miles to the south. Mobs took over the streets and set more fires. The next day, Northern soldiers arrived. And one day after that, Lincoln visited the city and sat in the office of Jefferson Davis.



Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, now reduced in size to 35,000 troops, had escaped to the west. They were starving, and Lee had asked the CONFEDERATE COMMISSARY DEPARTMENT to have rations for his infantry waiting at the AMELIA COURTHOUSE. But when he arrived there, no rations awaited his troops, and they were forced to forage the countryside for food. The delay caused by his need to acquire food proved fatal to the Confederate effort.

Now 125,000 Union soldiers were surrounding Lee's army, whose numbers had been reduced to 25,000 troops and were steadily falling. Still, Lee decided to make one last attempt to break out. On April 9, the remaining Confederate Army, under JOHN GORDON, drove back Union cavalry blocking the road near the village of APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE. But beyond them were 50,000 Union infantry, and as many or more were closing in on Lee from his rear. It was over.



Confederate troops burned Richmond as they retreated to the South.

Lee sent a note to Grant, and later that afternoon they met in the home of WILMER MCLEAN. Grant offered generous terms of surrender. Confederate officers and soldiers could go home, taking with them their horses, sidearms, and personal possessions. Also, Grant guaranteed their immunity from prosecution for treason. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the two men saluted each other and parted. Grant then sent three day's worth of food rations to the 25,000 Confederate soldiers. The official surrender ceremony occurred three days later, when Lee's troops stacked their rifles and battle flags.

President Lincoln's will to save the Union had prevailed. He looked with satisfaction on the survival of his country and with deep regret on the great damage that had been done. These emotions did not last long, however.

Lincoln had only five days left to live.
