== Finding fossil (a.n.)化石的 man

We can read of 读到,获悉 things that happened 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where people first learned to write. But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write. The only way that they can preserve their history is to recount 叙述，说明 it as sagas 尤指古代挪威或冰岛讲述冒险经历和英雄业绩的长篇故事 —legends handed down from one generation of storytellers 说故事的人 to another. These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they did. Anthropologists 人类学家 wondered where `主` the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples now living in the Pacific Islands `谓` came from. The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2,000 years ago.

But the first people who were like ourselves lived *so* long ago *that* even their sagas, if they had any, are forgotten. So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first 'modern men' came from.

Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially flint 燧石；打火石, because this is easier to shape (v.) than other kinds. They may 或许,也许 also have used (v.) wood and skins, but these have rotted away. Stone does not decay, and so the tools of long ago have remained when even `主` the bones of the men who made them `谓` have disappeared without trace.

== Spare (v.)使免遭伤害;使幸免 that spider

Why, you may wonder, should spiders be our friends? Because they destroy so many insects, and insects include some of the greatest enemies of the human race. Insects would make it impossible for us to live in the world; they would devour 狼吞虎咽地吃 all our crops and kill (v.) our flocks （羊或鸟）群 and herds 兽群；牧群, *if it were not for* 如果不是因为,由于 the protection we get from insect-eating animals. We owe a lot to the birds and beasts who eat insects /but all of them put together kill only _a fraction 小部分；少量；一点儿 of the number_ destroyed by spiders. Moreover, unlike some of the other insect eaters, spiders never do the least harm to us or our belongings.

.2.	if it were not for (如果不是因为/由于...）, 这句话用来表达一个虚拟语气.
- *If it were not for* his wife's money /he’d never be a director. 如果不是他妻子有钱，他永远也不会成为一个董事。
====


Spiders are not insects, as many people think, nor even nearly related to them. One can tell the difference almost at a glance, for a spider always has eight legs and an insect never more than six.

How many spiders are *engaged （使）从事，参加 in* this work _on our behalf_? One authority on spiders made a census （官方的）统计，人口普查 of the spiders in a grass field in the south of England, and he estimated that there were more than 2,250,000 in one acre 英亩; that is something like 大约，将近 6,000,000 spiders of different kinds on a football pitch. Spiders are busy for at least half the year in killing insects. It is impossible to make more than the wildest guess at how many they kill, but they are hungry creatures, not content with only three meals a day. It has been estimated that the weight of all the insects destroyed by spiders in Britain in one year would be greater than the total weight of all the human beings in the country.

== Matterhorn man

Modern alpinists 登山者，高山运动爱好者 try to climb (v.) mountains by a route 路线，航线 which will give them good sport, and the more difficult it is, the more highly it is regarded 认为，把……看作. In the pioneering 首创的，先驱的 days, however, this was not the case at all. The early climbers were looking for the easiest way to the top, because the summit was the prize they sought, especially if it had never been attained 取得，得到，获得 before. It is true that during their explorations they often faced difficulties and dangers of _the most perilous 危险的，艰险的；濒临灾难（或毁灭）的 nature_, equipped in a manner which would make a modern climber shudder （因恐惧、寒冷等）发抖，打战；强烈震动 at the thought, but they did not *go out of their way* 特意，想尽办法 to court (v.)试图获得，追求（关注或声望） such excitement. They had a single aim, a solitary goal —the top!

Except for one or two places such as Zermatt and Chamonix, which had rapidly become popular, Alpine villages tended to be impoverished 贫困的，赤贫的；（品质）恶化的 settlements 定居点，殖民地 cut off 使分离或孤立 from civilization by the high mountains. `主` Such inns 小旅馆，客栈 as there were `系` were generally dirty and flea-ridden (a.)充满跳蚤的; the food simply _local cheese_ accompanied by bread often twelve months old, all washed down with coarse (a.)粗糙的;（食物，饮料）粗劣的 wine.  +

Invariably 始终如一地，一贯地 the background was the same: dirt and poverty, and very uncomfortable. For men accustomed to eating seven-course 一道菜 dinners 正餐 and sleeping between fine linen (a.)亚麻的，亚麻布制的 sheets 铺床单 at home, the change to the Alps must have been very hard indeed 的确，确实.

== (迷信) Seeing (a.)有视觉的 hands

Several cases have been reported in Russia recently of people who can read and detect colours with their fingers, and even see through solid doors and walls. One case concerns 涉及，与……相关 an eleven-year-old schoolgirl, Vera Petrova, who has normal vision but who can also perceive 察觉，注意到；意识到 things with different parts of her skin, and through solid walls.

This ability was first noticed by her father. One day she came into his office and happened to put her hands on the door of a locked safe  (n.)保险箱.

During these tests she was able to read a newspaper through an opaque 不透明的，不透光的 screen and, stranger still, by moving her elbow 肘 over a child's game of Lotto /she was able to describe the figures  数字；人物 and colours 后定 printed on it; and, in another instance, wearing stockings 长袜 and slippers 拖鞋, to make out with her foot the outlines 轮廓，外形 and colours of a picture hidden under a carpet. Other experiments showed that her knees and shoulders had a similar sensitivity.

During all these tests Vera was blindfold  (v.)蒙住眼睛；挡住视线; and, indeed, except when blindfold she lacked the ability to perceive 理解；察觉，注意到；意识到 things with her skin. It was also found that although she could perceive things with her fingers /this ability ceased the moment her hands were wet.

.minstrel
-> 英语单词minstrel常用来表示“吟游诗人”，然而，从词源上看，它原本指的是国王或贵族家中的歌手。单词minstrel源自拉丁语ministralis，与minister（大臣、部长）、ministry（部门）同源，含有“家臣、奴仆”之意，指的是宫廷里或王公贵族家中的歌手，他们并非科班出身，只是由于有一定的文艺才能而被主人看中，专门负责唱歌吟诗，为主人及客人提供娱乐，地位与弄臣相仿。

后来，越来越多科班出身的音乐人开始得到王公贵族的青睐，那些半路出家的minstrel在宫廷里越来越不吃香，只好流落至民间，靠街头卖艺为生，变成了流浪歌手或吟游诗人。

在英语中，minstrel一词在16世纪之前指的都是宫廷里或贵族家中负责娱乐的歌手、说书人、杂耍艺人、小丑等。直到18世纪该词的词义才开始缩小，专指中世纪的吟游诗人或流浪歌手。

chatgpt: 这里的“back”并不是指真的倒退，而是指通过回归过去的某些趋势或价值观，来实现一种新的未来。 +

或者硅谷的发展似乎循环往复，有一种“回到过去，重新开启未来”的意味。

例如，当前许多科技趋势（如人工智能、区块链等）可能是基于过去未完成的梦想或重新审视的旧理念。作者使用 “push back to the future”，是为了强调一种“复古创新”的意境，既向未来迈进，又从过去汲取灵感。

An individual human existence should be like a river —small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately (ad.)热情地；强烈地；激昂地 past (v.) boulders 卵石；巨砾 and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, _without any visible break_ (间隔；缝隙)没有任何视野上的打破，即茫然一片，看不出任何界线, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being.

== The stuff of dreams

It is fairly clear that the sleeping period must have some function, and because there is so much of it the function would seem to be important. Speculations about its nature have been going on for literally thousands of years, and one odd finding that makes the problem puzzling is that it looks very much as if sleeping is not simply a matter of giving the body a rest. 'Rest', in terms of muscle relaxation and so on, can be achieved by a brief period lying, or even sitting down. The body's tissues are self-repairing and self-restoring to a degree, and function best when more or less continuously active. In fact a basic amount of movement occurs during sleep which is specifically concerned with preventing muscle inactivity.

If it is not a question of resting the body, then perhaps it is the brain that needs resting? This might be a plausible hypothesis were it not for two factors. First the electroencephalograph (which is simply a device for recording the electrical activity of the brain by attaching electrodes to the scalp) shows that while there is a change in the pattern of activity during sleep, there is no evidence that the total amount of activity is any less. The second factor is more interesting and more fundamental. Some years ago an American psychiatrist named William Dement published experiments dealing with the recording of eye-movements during sleep. He showed that the average individual's sleep cycle is punctuated with peculiar bursts of eye-movements, some drifting and slow, others jerky and rapid. People woken during these periods of eye-movements generally reported that they had been dreaming. When woken at other times they reported no dreams. If one group of people were disturbed from their eye-movement sleep for several nights on end, and another group were disturbed for an equal period of time but when they were not exhibiting eye-movements, the first group began to show some personality disorders while the others seemed more or less unaffected. The implications of all this were that it was not the disturbance of sleep that mattered, but the disturbance of dreaming.

'''

== Snake poison

How it came about that snakes manufactured poison is a mystery. Over the periods their saliva, a mild, digestive juice like our own, was converted into a poison that defies analysis even today. It was not forced upon them by the survival competition; they could have caught and lived on prey without using poison, just as the thousands of non-poisonous snakes still do. Poison to a snake is merely a luxury; it enables it to get its food with very little effort, no more effort than one bite. And why only snakes? Cats, for instance, would be greatly helped; no running fights with large, fierce rats or tussles with grown rabbits-just a bite and no more effort needed. In fact, it would be an assistance to all carnivores though it would be a two-edged weapon when they fought each other. But, of the vertebrates, unpredictable Nature selected only snakes (and one lizard). One wonders also why Nature, with some snakes, concocted poison of such extreme potency.

In the conversion of saliva into poison, one might suppose that a fixed process took place. It did not; some snakes manufactured a poison different in every respect from that of others, as different as arsenic is from strychnine, and having different effects. One poison acts on the nerves, the other on the blood.

The makers of the nerve poison include the mambas and the cobras and their venom is called neurotoxic. Vipers (adders) and rattlesnakes manufacture the blood poison, which is known as haemolytic. Both poisons are unpleasant, but by far the more unpleasant is the blood poison. It is said that the nerve poison is the more primitive of the two, that the blood poison is, so to speak, a newer product from an improved formula. Be that as it may, the nerve poison does its business with man far more quickly than the blood poison. This, however, means nothing.
