== 释义

Here's the transformed version with key vocabulary annotated in Chinese according to Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary:

Welcome to The Daily Show! My name is John Stewart. We got a great show for you tonight, my friend. I got a... I got a new tie with the chart. I'll tell you what - we got a great one. Paul Rudd is going to be... Paul Rudd finally had the ​​balls​​ 胆量 to come on this show after weeks of calling me a propagandist 宣传者. Know this: our interview will be unedited 未经剪辑的. Rudd's going down. It's happening. I'm going to... I'm going to give that dude an infection of the ​​paranium​​.

I should explain - we spent... we come out early, I do a little warm-up 热身 with the audience 观众, and uh... for some unknown reason (and it really was not prompted 被提示), I was trying to discuss uh... the relationship between asthma medication 哮喘药物 and a side effect 副作用 of an infection of the ​​paranium​​. Unfortunately, I have no one in the audience who was able to satisfy 满足 my curiosity 好奇心 on that. So uh... those of you at home who may be looking it up right now - wait till the commercial break 广告时间.

But first, a quick update 最新消息 on an administration 政府 that is once again carrying out 执行 its plans with competence 能力 and professionalism 专业素养. A reporter from The Atlantic says he was mistakenly 错误地 added to a group chat 群聊 with top members of the Trump administration as they were texting back and forth 来回发短信 about highly sensitive 高度敏感的 war plans 作战计划. Jeffrey Goldberg says he was included in a group chat full of our nation's top security officials 安全官员 discussing what we can only assume to be top secret 绝密的 plans to bomb Houthi targets across Yemen on March 15th - everything from the weapons America would be deploying 部署 to the timing 时间安排 and the attack sequences 攻击顺序. Oopsie poopsie!

[Applause]

You know, back in my day, if you were a journalist who wanted leaked 泄露的 war documents 战争文件, he'd work the sources 发展消息源, meet him in a dark garage 黑暗的车库, earn the trust 赢得信任, pound the pavement 四处奔走. Now you just wait for the national security adviser 国家安全顾问 to be distracted by White Lotus while he's setting up his "bomb Yemen" group chat. Are those guys jerking each other off 互相吹捧?

[Laughter]

By the way, I might be in this group chat. I don't know - I don't check my group chats. Perhaps my favorite text of the entire group chain was the one from our defense secretary 国防部长 saying quote: "We are currently clean on OPSEC." For those of you who don't know, OPSEC means operational security 行动安全. He said that in a group chat. A group chat with a journalist. The journalist said that he didn't think that the story was real until Yemen was bombed.

Oh, did I bring you down? Let's move on.

Because as you know, there are certain hypocrisies 虚伪 and absurdities 荒谬 that we find in our cultural moment that make for great fodder 素材 for humorous dialogue 幽默对话 - a facial expression 面部表情, a nod and a wink 眨眼示意. Then there are other pronouncements 声明 by our elected officials 民选官员, actions by our government that are so baldly... even though you know it will have no effect, and that these powerful creatures have been genetically modified 基因改造 to resist shame 羞耻感, self-reflection 自我反思 of any kind, you just can't help yourself but to go old school Daily Show gotcha 抓个正着.

I'm talking about the debate on free speech 言论自由. Now as we know, conservatives 保守派 have been very concerned about the loss of free speech in our country for a very long time. "Bullies on the left aiming to silence 使沉默 conservatives." "Free speech is under siege 被围困 in this country." "The leftists... they've become the thought police 思想警察." "They basically declare themselves God and judge us for our thoughts." "George Orwell was right - the thought police come next to punish thought crime 思想犯罪." "Be very, very scared."

[Applause]

I am. Perhaps not for the reasons you are. The thought police with you right now, Jimmy? Are they in the bottle?

But luckily, our national free speech nightmare 噩梦 recently came to an end when we entered the golden age 黄金时代 of Donald J... Trump. "We have saved free speech in America, and we've saved it strongly." "Free speech in America - it's back." Thank God we have a president now who believes in free speech.

Yes, thank God we have a president now who believes in free... just go ahead, roll through 12:
"I believe that CNN and MSNBC - what they do is illegal 非法的."
"I think CBS should lose its license 执照."
"But I think ABC should lose its license also because of what they've done."
"I watched what happened live."
"I think Bravo should also lose their license."

[Applause]

"What they did to Dorinda on 'Real Housewives'... they should be sent to a Salvadorian jail 萨尔瓦多监狱."

This is what I'm talking about. Generally, you've got to search the archives 档案 for contradictions 矛盾 on one's stated principles 既定原则, dig through policy papers 政策文件 to uncover private actions that are undermined by someone's public stance 公开立场. But this is so... this is so blatant 明目张胆的 I can't wrap my head around it 无法理解. It's not even the hypocrisy 虚伪 - it's that they so fetishize 盲目崇拜 free speech, this thing that they do not in any way actually practice.

"The freedom to speak our minds 畅所欲言 and express the truth that is our heart." Really? That's really a big chunk 一大块 of our heart? Any cardiologist 心脏病专家 will tell you - hearts come in chunks. Blood comes into the aorta 主动脉, to the right ventricle 右心室, passes through your speech chunk.

But since coming into office 就职, Trump and the Republicans have instituted policies 制定政策 that are a dagger 匕首 right through many people's speech chunks. The White House has barred 禁止 the Associated Press from presidential events because the AP has refused to rename the Gulf of Mexico the "Gulf of America" in its style book 风格指南. And in a dramatic escalation 戏剧性升级 against the American legal system 法律体系, Trump this weekend directed his government to target law firms 律师事务所 battling his actions. Federal immigration officials 联邦移民官员 arrested a Palestinian activist 巴勒斯坦活动家 who helped lead last year's student encampment protest 学生营地抗议 at Columbia. "I think we ought to get them all out of the country. They're troublemakers 麻烦制造者. They're agitators 煽动者. They don't love our country."

My chunks! My precious chunks! My lovely lady chunks! My chunks! My chunks! My lovely lady... you're making my ​​paranium​​ tingle 刺痛.

Here's the thing - these attacks on free speech, especially uh... the one where they deported 驱逐出境 that activist... if there's one thing that I know about the powerful principles 强大原则 at our higher education institutions 高等教育机构, they will not be bullied by a... roll 212: "Columbia University is bowing to 屈服于 President Trump's demands, announcing it will change a number of policies, among them placing the school's Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies department under academic receivership 学术接管 for at least 5 years."

Some students protest the war in Gaza, suddenly a whole academic department is on double secret probation 双重秘密观察期 with government oversight 政府监督. And by the way... okay, Middle East and African studies? What did they do? Sure, the African studies professors are like: "I teach intermediate Swahili 中级斯瓦希里语."

See, these guys don't give a ​​fuck​​ 不在乎 about free speech. They care about their speech. It's so blatant hypocrisy 明目张胆的虚伪. It's so old school Daily Show gotcha. You know what? I'm just going to put on the wig 假发 I used to wear during those years, because the hypocrisy is just so...

Here's Donald Trump on those who would criticize judges 批评法官 that he has appointed: "A lot of the judges that I had, if you look at them, they take tremendous abuse 巨大辱骂, and it's uh... truly interference 干涉 in my opinion, and it should be illegal, and it probably is illegal in some form." Yes, criticizing judges - it is interference, it should be illegal, tremendous abuse.

And four days later - not four days later, not a full French work week later - President Donald Trump just took to Truth Social and deemed this judge... responding to this uh decision here, calling him "a radical left lunatic 激进左翼疯子 of a judge," "a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama." He says this judge should be impeached 弹劾.

The hypocrisy... it burns. And are we really still doing the "Barack Hussein Obama" thing? Oh, free Harambe! Come on!

[Applause]

People... you see what was the whole thing that they hated about the left on free speech? "No one is safe from the left's word police 文字警察. No one." What exactly would an actual government-run word police organization look like?

The Trump administration is actively trying to purge 清除 the federal government of so-called "woke 觉醒的" initiatives. Government agencies have flagged 标记 hundreds of words to limit or avoid - words like DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 多元化、公平和包容), BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color 黑人、原住民和有色人种), anti-racism 反种族主义, Latinx 拉丁裔, Native American 原住民, black women... seemingly random words like "expression 表达," "at risk 处于危险中," "political 政治的," and even "mental health 心理健康" and "sex 性别."

What's left? BIPOC and Latinx - I get that. You're not allowed to say "sex"? You can't say words like "women" or "sex" or #MeToo? How can a lot of your cabinet members 内阁成员 describe their weekends?

You know, you can't protest in a way... you can't protest in a way that offends 冒犯 the right. You can't teach things that the right doesn't want you to teach. You can't read things that they don't want you to read. You can't use words that they don't want you to use. But they love free speech.

I guess fear not - at least we'll always have art. "President Trump demanding a painting of him be removed because he finds it unflattering 不讨好的."

[Applause]

He's demanding they take it down 要求撤下 because he believes this picture is unflattering 不讨人喜欢的... which really makes you think: do you think other pictures of you are flattering 好看的? At least in the painting they blended the foundation 粉底 into your hairline 发际线. But painting is out 绘画艺术完蛋了.

Oddly enough 奇怪的是, there is still one area of free speech that the right defends non-hypocritically 不虚伪地. I think they've come a long way 进步很大. Meta, Facebook - Mark Zuckerberg came to the White House. "Who I like much better now. You know, I have a warm spot in my heart 心里有温暖 for TikTok. Twitter - now they call it X, and it's great that Elon bought that. He's done us all a big favor 帮了大忙." He loves it. Meta, X, the tickity time.

Why is it that they're so enamored with 迷恋 social media? Studies by The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and academic organizations 学术机构 have found that the site forced political content 政治内容 on users - that content was almost invariably 几乎总是 pro-Trump, pro-Republican and pro-Musk.

Huh. The one area of free speech that they want to protect completely is the area that supports them and isn't actually free. Social media is algorithmic 算法驱动的, and it advances with key demographics 关键人群. Or to put that in the most hilarious way 最搞笑的方式 possible, the president sat down with Outkick's Clay Travis on Air Force One 空军一号 to discuss the status of his second term: "President Trump, getting to talk to you here on Air Force One, I wanted to start with this - why do you think young men are so overwhelmingly 压倒性地 coming in your direction?"

[Applause]

My work here is done 我的任务完成了. Perhaps I can answer that question. They are overwhelmingly coming in his direction because that is the direction they're facing 面对的方向. I don't know if you know how that works, but you really can't come in a direction you're not facing. Although young men at that age... you could bank a shot 反弹进球. I could... I could see one fly over the shoulder 从肩膀上方飞过. Maybe a trick shot 花式进球 where they landed in a cup, you know? Where that would go viral 走红网络. Social media.

The one place the right will unequivocally 明确地 protect free speech is the one place where the speech isn't actually free. Algorithms 算法. It's speech incentivized for engagement 参与度 and profit 利润. It's manipulated 被操纵的. It just so happens that the same process that forces you to doomscroll 末日刷屏 somehow also draws you into Republican ideology 共和党意识形态.

Social media is a machine designed to stimulate 刺激 the reptilian parts 原始脑区 of your brain that would otherwise beg you to go outside. It's like being impressed that casinos 赌场 give out free food. It's not free. Social media isn't the town square open forum 公共论坛 of ideas - it's got a plan 别有用心.

In the summer of 2019, Facebook created a fake account 虚假账号 for a 41-year-old mom they called her Carol Smith. Carol started off by liking a few popular conservative 保守派的 Facebook pages, but quickly Facebook began dragging her down a rabbit hole 兔子洞 of misinformation 错误信息. After only 2 days, Facebook recommended Carol follow a QAnon page, and a few days later it suggested she follow another. By week three, Carol's feed 信息流 had become quote "a constant flow 持续不断的 of misleading 误导性的 and polarizing content 极化内容." Now Carol Smith is a completely fictional character 虚构人物, and yet her children have stopped talking to her.

[Applause]

Although she was apparently added to a Pentagon group chat 五角大楼群聊 and knows the details about when they're bombing.

[Music]

Guys, social media isn't the same as free speech. Social media is free speech in the way that Doritos are food. It's ultra-processed 超加工的. It's designed in laboratories 实验室设计的. It's the same mechanism 机制 that somehow convinced you that you should eat a 50-story skyscraper 50层摩天大楼 of potato-ish 类似土豆的东西.

[Applause]

And the most disappointing thing - where are my conspiracy theorists 阴谋论者 at? Now that it's on the right, for God's sake, billionaires are designing machines to manipulate our speech, to control our behavior and rewire 重新连接 our brains. They're removing our regular speech and doing a... I don't know, great replacement 大替代 of it to solidify their hold on power 巩固权力. Are you awake yet 你们醒了吗? Come on, you were with me on the lab leak thing 实验室泄漏说. Remember what happened? Come on, you've barely even touched your Epstein binders 爱泼斯坦档案. Doesn't this bother you at all 一点都不困扰吗?

"Elon Musk has taken a very courageous stand 勇敢立场 for the First Amendment 第一修正案. He's tough as a pine knot 坚强如松节, and the man's got guts 有胆量. He's got... he's got oranges the size of beach balls 沙滩球那么大的橙子."

Please stop with this Foghorn Leghorn "he's got oranges the size of baseballs." But let me guess - how do you feel about other billionaires owning and manipulating our media? "Mr. Soros is now the largest single shareholder 最大单一股东 in uh... in Audacy radio stations in America. You can't just go do this. Mr. Soros is a billionaire." Pass me the sick bucket 给我呕吐桶. Sitting right... pass us all the motherfucking sick bucket 给我们所有人该死的呕吐桶.

[Music]

== 中文翻译

欢迎收看《每日秀》！我是乔恩·斯图尔特。朋友们，今晚我们准备了精彩节目。瞧我这新领带——带图表的那种！咱们可有好戏看了：保罗·路德终于鼓起勇气登台了，**之前他连着几周骂我是政治宣传员。**事先声明——这段采访绝不剪辑。路德要完蛋了，我说的。我非得让这家伙染上"蛋蛋炎"不可。

得解释下——我们提前暖场时，我正和观众讨论哮喘药物与"蛋蛋炎"副作用的关联（纯属自发行为，没人起哄）。可惜现场没人能解答这个医学问题。家里正在查手机的朋友——等广告时段再查吧。

首先插播快讯：本届政府再次展现出专业高效的执政风范。《大西洋月刊》记者意外被拉进特朗普政府高层的群聊，目睹他们用短信商讨"轰炸也门胡塞武装的绝密计划"。杰弗里·戈德伯格称，这个满是国安高官的群里, 详细讨论了3月15日的空袭行动——从美军武器配置, 到攻击时序, 一应俱全。哎呀呀！

[掌声]

**想当年记者要搞机密文件，得发展线人、摸黑接头、博取信任。现在只要等国安顾问追《白莲花度假村》时, 分神拉错群就行。**这群人是在互相打手枪吗？

[笑声]

说不定我也在群里——毕竟我从不看群消息。最绝的是国防部长发的："目前行动保密工作到位。"OPSEC是"行动安全"缩写啊！这话发在有个记者潜伏的群里！那记者说直到炸弹落下, 才相信这事是真的。

气氛太沉重了？我们继续。

有些文化现象, 自带荒诞幽默感——一个眼神就能会心一笑。*但面对官员那些赤裸裸的...明知谴责无效，明知这些权力生物天生没有羞耻心，我们《每日秀》还是忍不住要老派较真。*

说说"言论自由"之争。*保守派长期忧心我国言论自由沦丧*："左派霸凌要封杀保守派""言论自由遭受围攻""左棍成了思想警察""他们自封上帝, 审判思想""奥威尔预言的'思想罪'来了""大家千万当心"。

[掌声]

我确实害怕——但理由不同。吉米你现在被思想警察盯上了？他们藏在酒瓶里？

好在特朗普总统开启了言论自由的黄金时代："我们强力拯救了美国言论自由""言论自由回来了"。谢天谢地终于有位信仰言论自由的总统。

没错感恩这位信仰言论...直接放片段吧： +
"CNN和MSNBC的行为, 已构成违法" +
"CBS该被吊销执照" +
"ABC也该被吊销执照" +
"我亲眼所见" +
"Bravo频道同样该被吊销执照" +

[掌声]

"《真实主妇》节目组对多琳达做的事...该把他们关进萨尔瓦多监狱"

我说的就是这种双标。**通常你得翻箱倒柜找档案，才能挖出某人公开立场与私下行为的矛盾。但这次...这次简直赤裸得让我脑回路短路。**重点甚至不是虚伪——而是他们把言论自由当神拜，自己却从不践行。

"畅所欲言、吐露心声的自由"？认真的？心声还分区块的？随便找个心脏科医生都会告诉你——心脏本来就是分块的。血液从主动脉流到右心室，还得先经过你的"言论瓣膜"。

但特朗普和共和党上台后，他们的政策, 就像尖刀直插无数人的"言论瓣膜"。白宫因"美联社"拒绝在格式手册中将墨西哥湾改称"美国湾"，禁止其报道总统活动；特朗普上周更升级对抗美国司法体系，下令政府针对与其作对的"律所"(律师事务所), 采取行动；联邦移民局逮捕了去年哥伦比亚大学学生营地抗议的巴勒斯坦籍领袖。"这些闹事分子、煽动者不爱国，该统统驱逐出境"。

我的瓣膜！我珍贵的瓣膜！我可爱的女士瓣膜！我的瓣膜！我的瓣膜！我可爱的女士...你们搞得我蛋蛋都在发颤。

关键是这些打压言论的举动...特别是驱逐活动家那事...*要说高校有什么雷打不动的原则，那就是绝不向威逼低头*...放212号片段："*哥伦比亚大学屈服于特朗普要求，宣布将中东、南亚及非洲研究院, 置于"学术监管"至少五年。*"

**几个学生抗议加沙战争，突然整个院系就被秘密监管。**话说...中东和非洲研究院招谁惹谁了？难道教斯瓦希里语的教授都在搞事情？

看见没？**这帮人压根不在乎言论自由，只在乎自己发声。如此赤裸的双标，**简直是为《每日秀》量身定做的经典打脸素材。知道吗？我要戴上当年那顶假发了——这虚伪浓度实在高得...

听听特朗普怎么评价"批评了他任命法官的人"："我的法官们遭受巨大侮辱，这根本是干预司法，应该算违法，某种程度上可能已经违法"。**没错，批评法官就是干预司法，**就该算违法，简直是巨大侮辱。

*结果四天后*——都不用等法国人罢工周期结束——*特朗普总统就在Truth Social上骂法官是"奥巴马任命的极左疯子""该被弹劾的煽动分子"。*

**这双标...灼烧灵魂啊！**现在还用"侯赛因·奥巴马"这种称呼？解放大猩猩哈兰贝算了！

人们总说左派搞"文字警察"——"没人能逃过左派的言论审查"。那真正的政府文字审查机构该是什么样？

特朗普政府正在联邦系统内清洗所谓"觉醒主义"倡议。各部门已列出数百个限制用语：DEI（多元平等包容）、BIPOC（黑人原住民有色人种）、"反种族主义"、"拉丁裔"、"原住民"、"黑人女性"...甚至随机词汇如"表达"、"高风险"、"政治"、"心理健康"和"性"。

还剩什么能说？BIPOC和拉丁裔被禁我理解——但连"性"都不让提？"女性"、"性侵"、"MeToo"都成违禁词？请问内阁成员怎么描述周末艳遇？

你看——抗议不能冒犯右派，教学不能触及右派禁区，阅读必须符合右派书单，用词得通过右派审核。但他们坚称自己捍卫言论自由。

别担心，至少我们还有艺术。"特朗普要求撤下他认为'不够帅'的总统肖像画"

[掌声]

他嫌画像丑要求撤展...这让人不禁思考：您觉得其他照片就好看吗？至少画师还帮您把粉底液抹匀到发际线呢。看来绘画艺术也完蛋了。

讽刺的是，右派倒是在某个领域始终如一地捍卫言论自由。Meta的扎克伯格拜访白宫后，特朗普盛赞："我现在可喜欢他了。对TikTok也改观了。推特？现在叫X啦，马斯克收购真是造福全人类。"他爱死这些社交平台了。

为什么？《华尔街日报》《华盛顿邮报》等机构研究发现，这些平台向用户强制推送的政治内容——清一色支持特朗普、共和党和马斯克。

哈！他们唯一全力保护的"言论自由"，恰恰是能帮他们洗脑的非自由领域。社交媒体靠算法运作，精准锁定关键人群。用最荒诞的话说就是——总统在空军一号接受采访时被问："为什么年轻男性如此支持您？"

[掌声]

答案很简单：因为他们被算法转过来对着您啊！虽然年轻小伙子的确可能...来个回头杀？或者玩个病毒传播的骚操作？毕竟这就是社交媒体嘛。

右派所谓捍卫的"言论自由"，实则是用算法激励的盈利工具。这套让你沉迷刷屏的机制，恰好能把你卷进共和党意识形态。社交平台就像赌场免费餐——看似慷慨实则算计。这不是思想广场，而是精密设计的洗脑车间。

2019年Facebook用虚拟账号"卡罗尔·史密斯"做实验。这个41岁主妇起初只是关注了几个保守派主页，但算法很快把她拖进阴谋论漩涡：两天后推荐QAnon，三周后时间线已充满"误导性极端内容"。虽然卡罗尔是虚构人物，她的"子女"已经拒绝和她说话。

[掌声]

不过她可能被误拉进了五角大楼群聊，现在对轰炸时间表了如指掌。

[音乐]

朋友们，社交媒体≠言论自由。就像多力多滋≠健康食品——都是实验室调配的超加工产物。这套机制能让你啃完五十层薯片塔，自然也能让你吞下极端思想。

最可悲的是——阴谋论爱好者哪去了？当权右派正在用亿万富翁设计的机器操控言论、改写大脑、用算法替换真实表达来巩固权力。这都不算"大重构"？当初实验室泄漏说你们可积极了！埃普斯坦档案都没翻完就不管了？

"马斯克勇敢捍卫宪法第一修正案！这硬汉胆识过人，睾丸大得像沙滩球！"

别学《乐一通》公鸡打鸣了！换其他富豪操控媒体你们就骂："索罗斯控股广播公司！亿万富翁岂能为所欲为！" 快给我呕吐袋...给所有人他妈的呕吐袋！

[音乐]

Welcome to The Daily Show! My name is John Stewart. We got a great show for you tonight, my friend. I got a... I got a new tie with the chart. I'll tell you what - we got a great one.

"The freedom to speak our minds and express the truth that is our heart." Really? That's really a big chunk of our heart? Any cardiologist will tell you - hearts come in chunks. Blood comes into the aorta, to the right ventricle, passes through your speech chunk.

He says this judge should be impeached.

The hypocrisy... it burns. And are we really still doing the "Barack Hussein Obama" thing? Oh, free Harambe! Come on!

[Applause]

People... you see what was the whole thing that they hated about the left on free speech? "No one is safe from the left's word police. No one." What exactly would an actual government-run word police organization look like?

The Trump administration is actively trying to purge the federal government of so-called "woke" initiatives. Government agencies have flagged hundreds of words to limit or avoid - words like DEI, BIPOC, anti-racism, Latinx, Native American, black women... seemingly random words like "expression," "at risk," "political," and even "mental health" and "sex."

What's left? BIPOC and Latinx - I get that. You're not allowed to say "sex"? You can't say words like "women" or "sex" or #MeToo? How can a lot of your cabinet members describe their weekends?

You know, you can't protest in a way... you can't protest in a way that offends the right. You can't teach things that the right doesn't want you to teach. You can't read things that they don't want you to read. You can't use words that they don't want you to use. But they love free speech.

I guess fear not - at least we'll always have art. "President Trump demanding a painting of him be removed because he finds it unflattering."

[Applause]

He's demanding they take it down because he believes this picture is unflattering... which really makes you think: do you think other pictures of you are flattering? At least in the painting they blended the foundation into your hairline. But painting is out.

Oddly enough, there is still one area of free speech that the right defends non-hypocritically. I think they've come a long way. Meta, Facebook - Mark Zuckerberg came to the White House. "Who I like much better now. You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok. Twitter - now they call it X, and it's great that Elon bought that. He's done us all a big favor." He loves it. Meta, X, the tickity time.

Why is it that they're so enamored with social media? Studies by The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and academic organizations have found that the site forced political content on users - that content was almost invariably pro-Trump, pro-Republican and pro-Musk.

Huh. The one area of free speech that they want to protect completely is the area that supports them and isn't actually free. Social media is algorithmic, and it advances with key demographics. Or to put that in the most hilarious way possible, the president sat down with Outkick's Clay Travis on Air Force One to discuss the status of his second term: "President Trump, getting to talk to you here on Air Force One, I wanted to start with this - why do you think young men are so overwhelmingly coming in your direction?"

[Applause]

My work here is done. Perhaps I can answer that question. They are overwhelmingly coming in his direction because that is the direction they're facing. I don't know if you know how that works, but you really can't come in a direction you're not facing. Although young men at that age... you could bank a shot. I could... I could see one fly over the shoulder. Maybe a trick shot where they landed in a cup, you know? Where that would go viral. Social media.

The one place the right will unequivocally protect free speech is the one place where the speech isn't actually free. Algorithms. It's speech incentivized for engagement and profit. It's manipulated. It just so happens that the same process that forces you to doomscroll somehow also draws you into Republican ideology.

Social media is a machine designed to stimulate the reptilian parts of your brain that would otherwise beg you to go outside. It's like being impressed that casinos give out free food. It's not free. Social media isn't the town square open forum of ideas - it's got a plan.

In the summer of 2019, Facebook created a fake account for a 41-year-old mom they called her Carol Smith. Carol started off by liking a few popular conservative Facebook pages, but quickly Facebook began dragging her down a rabbit hole of misinformation. After only 2 days, Facebook recommended Carol follow a QAnon page, and a few days later it suggested she follow another. By week three, Carol's feed had become quote "a constant flow of misleading and polarizing content." Now Carol Smith is a completely fictional character, and yet her children have stopped talking to her.

[Applause]

Although she was apparently added to a Pentagon group chat and knows the details about when they're bombing.

[Music]

Guys, social media isn't the same as free speech. Social media is free speech in the way that Doritos are food. It's ultra-processed. It's designed in laboratories. It's the same mechanism that somehow convinced you that you should eat a 50-story skyscraper of potato-ish.

[Applause]

And the most disappointing thing - where are my conspiracy theorists at? Now that it's on the right, for God's sake, billionaires are designing machines to manipulate our speech, to control our behavior and rewire our brains. They're removing our regular speech and doing a... I don't know, great replacement of it to solidify their hold on power. Are you awake yet? Come on, you were with me on the lab leak thing. Remember what happened? Come on, you've barely even touched your Epstein binders. Doesn't this bother you at all?

"Elon Musk has taken a very courageous stand for the First Amendment. He's tough as a pine knot, and the man's got guts. He's got... he's got oranges the size of beach balls."

Please stop with this Foghorn Leghorn "he's got oranges the size of baseballs." But let me guess - how do you feel about other billionaires owning and manipulating our media? "Mr. Soros is now the largest single shareholder in uh... in Audacy radio stations in America. You can't just go do this. Mr. Soros is a billionaire." Pass me the sick bucket. Sitting right... pass us all the motherfucking sick bucket.
