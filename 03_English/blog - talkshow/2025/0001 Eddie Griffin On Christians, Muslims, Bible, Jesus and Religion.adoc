== 释义

#I don't go to# church 教堂. God don't live in church. They say the body is the temple 圣殿；神殿. I'm walking in church right now.

As soon as you go to church, there's somebody trying to stick a dick 阴茎 in you, and they need some money.

Every war in humanity's history #has been over# 由于，关于 some kind of bullshit 胡说；废话 religion 宗教. #You know what I mean?# #I don't *get caught up in* 卷入某事物中 that shit# 烂事 because I don't think God ever wrote (v.) a Bible 圣经 or a Quran 古兰经. He didn't have to write *no* 加重语气 book. He ain't *no* 加重语气 playwright 剧作家. It's written (v.) in your essence 本质.

.案例
====
.over
because of or concerning sth; about sth 由于；关于 +
•an argument over money 为了钱的争吵 +
•a disagreement over the best way to proceed 在如何采用最好的方法上出现的分歧

.He didn't have to write no book. He ain't no playwright.
**这段话的作者使用了"双重否定"，这是一种在非正式英语，**尤其是非裔美国 Vernacular 英语（AAVE）中常见的语言现象。

在标准英语中，这句话应该是 "He didn't have to write any book" 或者 "He had to write no book." +
但是，作者使用了 "no" 来加强否定语气。 +
*"no"在这里的作用是，加重语气，表示根本没有，一点也没有。*

"He ain't no playwright." +
同样，标准英语应该是 "He isn't a playwright." +
**"ain't" 是 "is not" 或 "are not" 的非正式形式，**而 "no" 再次加强了否定。 +
“ain't” 和 “no” 同时使用，再一次加强了否定语气。
====

Because the Bible was written by men: the Book of Peter, the Book of John, the whole book about Jesus. But that motherfucker 混蛋 ain't wrote (v.) one book. #The shit 烂事 that is# about _getting right_ (以适当的方式做某事) 这是关于"如何做正确"的狗屎... All the hangouts 常去的地方 wrote a book. Shit, I know the Bible, Quran （伊斯兰教）可兰经.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.All the hangouts wrote a book.
这段文本中，“hangouts”的使用方式比较特殊，它并不是指我们通常理解的“闲逛的地方”或者“聚会”。在这里，它的含义更接近于：
“hangouts”指的是“一群人”或者“一伙人”。 +
具体来说，在这个语境下，它指的是：
围绕着耶稣的那些人，也就是耶稣的门徒或者追随者。

所以，“All the hangouts wrote a book”的意思是：
“所有那些（围绕着耶稣的）人，都写了一本书。”  +
在您提供的这段文本中，它的用法是比较特殊的，需要根据上下文来理解。
====

And you notice each one of them books —the closest one to Jesus? Peter. Like damn 该死, man, Jesus was tight 厉害的. In John's book, y'all 你们大家 damn 该死的 near the sugar daddy 金主爸爸. You know?

God didn't write no book. It's written in your essence 本质，要素. #Nobody ever *had to* tell you# 没人需要告诉你 it's wrong to kill your mama 妈妈. Somehow 以某种方式，用某种方法 #you born (v.) innately 天生地 knowing that#, *which means* you born (v.) knowing right and wrong. So put the book down /'cause #it will **fuck 搞砸 you up**#. You understand me?

It starts out *messed up* 混乱的 in the beginning. In the Book of Genesis 创世纪（《圣经》中的篇章）, in the beginning, there was Adam and Eve. And Adam and Eve had two sons: Cain and Abel. And Cain and Abel *got married*... to who? #Where did these# mystery bitches 婊子 #come from?#

#I like messing with# 戏弄,与……开玩笑或捉弄 Christians /'cause #they easy to get.# You know #they skin (v.)擦破（身体某部位）,敏感 quickly#. I tell a Christian 基督徒，信徒 in a minute: "I don't believe Jesus died (v.) on no cross 十字架." #Sacrilege# (n.)亵渎! I said, "Well wait a minute —he could walk on water, *feed* (v.) a thousand *with* a loaf of bread 一条面包, #raise (v.)（使）直立，站立 the dead# 复活死人, #but you telling me# this nigga 黑鬼 couldn't handle three nails 钉子? I know brothers (n.) with nine bullet wounds 枪伤 still walking around 四处走动. His name is 50 Cent. #You telling me# 50 Cent colder 更冷酷的 than Jesus? Maybe you delusional (a.)妄想的, bitch 贱货."

[.my1]
.案例
====
.sacrilege 亵渎，渎圣
-> sacri-,神圣的，-leg,拿，带，收集，词源同 collect,select.字面意思为拿走献神的祭品，引申词 义亵渎，渎圣。
====

#I bet you# 我敢打赌 `主` Jesus `系`  was a cool kid. His mama #be like# 他妈妈会说, "Now Jesus, #go on in there# 进去吧 /and take a bath, and don't be walking on your water." That's probably why they invented the shower —just to get the nigga （美国俚语）黑人 wet.

Look at some of _the Christian heads_ 每人 in here: "#You're going to hell# 你要下地狱了!" Don't be talking about Jesus yet. Don't be talking about it. You know how Jesus whistle (v.)吹口哨? You know, with the hole in the hand? Look, #y'all really like shit# 你们真的很喜欢狗屎. That's it —#the lightning's 闪电 coming# 闪电要来了. Christians always the first one want to send somebody: "You're going to hell!"

#I don't fuck with 招惹 you# though. Like God came down: "Oh, let that nigga know you're going to hell. I'm kind of busy right now." You know what I mean?

#I made my _Heavenly 天国的；天空的；神圣的 Father's image_ 形象# 我按天父的形象被造. If I got a sense of humor 幽默感, that means God got one. God probably up there *cracking up* 大笑 right now: "Hey Jesus, come here! That crazy nigga *made his own*. He's talking about your boy. He said you walk (v.) on your back walk. He said you whistle (v.) like this." I don't get mad# 我不会生气. Shit, that nigga was funny.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.That crazy nigga made his own
“made his own”意思是：“自己编造的”或者“自己创造的”。 因为文章的背景是, 本文作者认为，有人自己创造了一些关于上帝或者宗教的说法或者故事。因此，“That crazy nigga made his own”的意思是：“那个疯子(本文作者)自己编造的。”表明本文作者对某些宗教说法或者故事的否定和不屑。
====

They always try to make God 宾补 _this uptight 紧张的 asshole_ 混蛋. You know what I mean? Like if you get some pussy 女阴,阴道, you're going to hell 你会下地狱的. You made the pussy! #Shouldn't have made# this old pussy #good# 本不应该把这老屄造的这么好. I mean, #what kind of# catch-22 （因冲突）无法摆脱的困境;第二十二条军规;进退两难 #is that#? "Here, Eddie, has some pussy 艾迪，有一些阴户, but *don't partake (v.)分担；分享 in* 参与 it." Bullshit!

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Shouldn't have made this old pussy good

- "pussy":
这是一个非常粗俗的俚语，指女性的阴道。
在某些情况下，它也可以用作一个贬义词，指代女性。
- "good":
在这里，*"good"指的是令人愉悦的，令人满意的。*

因此，字面上的翻译是：
“本不应该把这老屄造的这么好。” +
在这段脱口秀中，说话者认为，如果神创造了"性"，那么就不应该禁止它。

.catch-22
“catch-22”是一个英语惯用语，它描述了一种无法摆脱的困境，因为其中的规则或条件相互矛盾。 +
一个两难的困境，其中任何解决方案, 都会导致问题。

《第22条军规》描述了美国军队在二战中的荒谬情境。在小说中，*根据第22条军规，精神不正常的士兵能够获准免于执行飞行任务，但必须由本人提出申请，而你一旦提出申请，恰好证明了你是一个正常人，因为只有神志清醒的人才能预测危险，为保障自己的安全付出行动。*

**在英文里，“catch”也有“捕捉、圈套”的含义。**第22条军规不仅是一条规则，更成为了军官用来剥削和折磨士兵的工具。作者也借此提出了小说的核心批判：专制与官僚制度, 在世界上设置了重重圈套和荒谬规则，陷入其中的人会变成它们的奴隶。

如今，catch-22代指一个因为互相抵触的规则或条件，让人进退两难、无法脱身的处境。在生活中，每个人都可能遭遇这样的荒诞。例如，寻找实习机会的学生发现，许多公司要求实习生已经拥有工作经验。

See, I'd be a Muslim 穆斯林, but the Muslim faith —they too strict 严格的. You know what I mean? You can't smoke (v.) no weed 大麻, you can't get your dick sucked 吸，吮；吸收；吞没 by a bitch that ain't your wife. #Matter of fact# 实际上, you can't see your wife's face until you marry (v.) her. #They keep them veiled 戴面纱的 up.# `主` All you get to see `系`  is the eyes. You really gotta love (v.) that bitch's eyes. Even like, "Damn, she got some pretty eyes." Then you marry her, the veil come off... No wonder they get 20 wives. #You playing (v.) the law of averages# 平均法则.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.You playing _the law of averages_
“law of averages”（平均律）指的是一种统计学上的概念，它认为： +
在大量的随机事件中，各种结果出现的频率, 会趋向于它们的概率。
也就是说，如果某个事件发生的概率是固定的，那么随着试验次数的增加，这个事件发生的频率会越来越接近它的概率。

因此，“You playing the law of averages”这句话的含义是：
“你正在利用平均律。”
或者更通俗地说，“你正在碰运气，认为随着次数的增加，好的结果一定会发生。”。

====

I'm telling you, I think Christians are jealous (a.)妒忌的  of Muslims /because #you ain't gonna 即将，将要 out-devout (a.)比...更虔诚 a Muslim.# That's the most devout 虔诚的 faith you ever run into 撞上，碰上. A Muslim will strap (v.)绑 a bomb 炸弹 on themselves /and *blow (v.) yourself up* about some Muhammad 穆罕默德. A Christian? "Nah, *put* a bomb *on* /and *blow (v.) yourself up* about Jesus?" No, he wouldn't want me to do that. He just blessed (v.)祝福 me with this house. I'm sure he wants me to live in it.

Everybody *fighting over* this religious shit. You understand me? The Christians say Jesus is the messenger 使者. The Muslims say it's Muhammad. I say, #who gives a fuck# 谁在乎 who the messenger is? Did you get the message? They got the same damn message: "#Do unto 朝；向；到；对 others /as you would have them do unto you# (你希望别人怎样对待你，就要怎样对待别人) 己所不欲勿施于人."

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Do unto others /as you would have them do unto you.
1.to or towards sb/sth 朝；向；到；对 +
•The angel appeared unto him in a dream. 在梦中天使出现在他面前。 +

2.until a particular time or event 直到；到…为止 +
•The knights swore loyalty unto death. 骑士们宣誓至死效忠。

== 翻译

我不去教堂。上帝不住在教堂里。他们说身体就是圣殿，我现在正走在教堂里呢。

*你一进教堂，就有人想往你身上塞根老二，还跟你要钱。*

人类历史上的每一场战争, 都是为了某种狗屁宗教。懂我意思吗？我不掺和这种破事，因为**我觉得上帝根本没写过《圣经》或《古兰经》。他不需要写书，他又不是剧作家。真理写在你的本质里。**

因为《圣经》是人写的：《彼得书》《约翰书》，整本关于耶稣的书。但**耶稣那混蛋自己没写过一本书。那些关于“救赎”的破书……全是马仔写的。**妈的，我读过《圣经》《古兰经》。

你注意到没？*这些书里最接近耶稣的是彼得。比如约翰书里把耶稣写得像个金主爸爸。*

上帝没写过书。真理在你的本质里。从没人需要告诉你“杀你妈是错的”，你天生就知道——说明你生来就懂是非。所以放下那本书，它会害惨你。懂吗？

一开始就乱七八糟。*《创世纪》里说, 最初有亚当夏娃，他们生了该隐和亚伯。然后这俩兄弟结婚了……跟谁结的？那些神秘婊子从哪儿冒出来的？*

我爱逗基督徒，因为他们容易上钩。我直接说：“我不信耶稣死在十字架上。”亵渎！我说：“**等等——他能水上行走、用一条面包喂饱千人、让死人复活，但你们告诉我这哥们扛不住三根钉子？**我认识身中九枪还活蹦乱跳的兄弟，他叫50美分。你们说50美分比耶稣还硬？你们他妈疯了吧。”

我打赌耶稣当年是个酷小孩。他妈肯定说：“耶稣去洗澡，别在水上走！”所以人类发明淋浴——就为了把这哥们淋湿。

看看这些基督徒：“你要下地狱了！”别急着审判。你知道耶稣怎么吹口哨吗？就是手上有个洞那种。你们真他妈欠雷劈。基督徒最爱送人下地狱。

我才不掺和。上帝肯定说：“让那混蛋下地狱？老子正忙着呢。”

**我按天父的形象被造。我有幽默感，说明上帝也有。**他现在肯定在天堂笑疯：“耶稣快看！这疯子说你用伤口吹口哨！”我不生气，这他妈太好笑了。

**他们总把上帝塑造成古板混蛋。比如“搞女人就下地狱”。可阴道也是你造的！干嘛把它造得这么诱人？这不坑人吗？“**给埃迪阴道但不让碰”，扯淡！

我想过信**伊斯兰教，**但他们太严格。不能抽大麻，不能让老婆以外的女人口交，*结婚前连老婆脸都看不见——只能看眼睛。你必须真爱她的眼睛才行。结果一结婚面纱摘下……难怪他们能娶20个老婆，这是玩概率游戏呢。*

我觉得基督徒嫉妒穆斯林，因为没人比穆斯林更虔诚。穆斯林能为穆罕默德绑炸弹自爆，基督徒呢？“为耶稣自爆？”不，他刚赐我房子，肯定想让我好好住。

**全在为宗教打架。**基督徒说耶稣是先知，穆斯林说是穆罕默德。我说, 谁在乎先知是谁？重点是你领悟教义了吗？他们说的根本一样：“己所不欲勿施于人。”

*科学证明这是真理：作用力等于反作用力。别惹我，我就不惹你。*

I don't go to church. God don't live in church. They say the body is the temple. I'm walking in church right now.

As soon as you go to church, there's somebody trying to stick a dick in you, and they need some money.

Every war in humanity's history has been over some kind of bullshit religion. You know what I mean? I don't get caught up in that shit because I don't think God ever wrote a Bible or a Quran. He didn't have to write no book. He ain't no playwright. It's written in your essence.

Because the Bible was written by men: the Book of Peter, the Book of John, the whole book about Jesus. But that motherfucker ain't wrote one book. The shit that is about getting right... All the hangouts wrote a book. Shit, I know the Bible, Quran.

And you notice each one of them books—the closest one to Jesus? Peter. Like damn, man, Jesus was tight. In John's book, y'all damn near the sugar daddy. You know?

God didn't write no book. It's written in your essence. Nobody ever had to tell you it's wrong to kill your mama. Somehow you born innately knowing that, which means you born knowing right and wrong. So put the book down 'cause it will fuck you up. You understand me?

It starts out messed up in the beginning. In the Book of Genesis, in the beginning, there was Adam and Eve. And Adam and Eve had two sons: Cain and Abel. And Cain and Abel got married... to who? Where did these mystery bitches come from?

I like messing with Christians 'cause they easy to get. You know they skin quickly. I tell a Christian in a minute: "I don't believe Jesus died on no cross." Sacrilege! I said, "Well wait a minute—he could walk on water, feed a thousand with a loaf of bread, raise the dead, but you telling me this nigga couldn't handle three nails? I know brothers with nine bullet wounds still walking around. His name is 50 Cent. You telling me 50 Cent colder than Jesus? Maybe you delusional, bitch."

I bet you Jesus was a cool kid. His mama be like, "Now Jesus, go on in there and take a bath, and don't be walking on your water." That's probably why they invented the shower—just to get the nigga wet.

Look at some of the Christian heads in here: "You going to hell!" Don't be talking about Jesus yet. Don't be talking about it. You know how Jesus whistle? You know, with the hole in the hand? Look, y'all really like shit. That's it—the lightning's coming. Christians always the first one want to send somebody: "You're going to hell!"

I don't fuck with you though. Like God came down: "Oh, let that nigga know you're going to hell. I'm kind of busy right now." You know what I mean?

I made my Heavenly Father's image. If I got a sense of humor, that means God got one. God probably up there cracking up right now: "Hey Jesus, come here! That crazy nigga made his own. He's talking about your boy. He said you walk on your back walk. He said you whistle like this." I don't get mad. Shit, that nigga was funny.

They always try to make God this uptight asshole. You know what I mean? Like if you get some pussy, you're going to hell. You made the pussy! Shouldn't have made this old pussy good. I mean, what kind of catch-22 is that? "Here, Eddie, has some pussy, but don't partake in it." Bullshit!

See, I'd be a Muslim, but the Muslim faith—they too strict. You know what I mean? You can't smoke no weed, you can't get your dick sucked by a bitch that ain't your wife. Matter of fact, you can't see your wife's face until you marry her. They keep them veiled up. All you get to see is the eyes. You really gotta love that bitch's eyes. Even like, "Damn, she got some pretty eyes." Then you marry her, the veil come off... No wonder they get 20 wives. You playing the law of averages.

I'm telling you, I think Christians are jealous of Muslims because you ain't gonna out-devout a Muslim. That's the most devout faith you ever run into. A Muslim will strap a bomb on themselves and blow yourself up about some Muhammad. A Christian? "Nah, put a bomb on and blow yourself up about Jesus?" No, he wouldn't want me to do that. He just blessed me with this house. I'm sure he wants me to live in it.

Everybody fighting over this religious shit. You understand me? The Christians say Jesus is the messenger. The Muslims say it's Muhammad. I say, who gives a fuck who the messenger is? Did you get the message? They got the same damn message: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."

Science proves that to be a fact. For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction. Don't fuck with me, and I won't fuck with you.
