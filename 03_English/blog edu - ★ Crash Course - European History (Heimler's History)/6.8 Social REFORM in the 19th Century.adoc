== 释义

All right, we've already established 查实；确定；证实 that /the Industrial Revolution was a major force of change in the world. But for a lot of people, that change was for the worse 这种变化是越变越糟. So in this video, we need to talk about all the reforms in the 19th century /that attempted to make those people's lives a little less miserable 悲惨的；痛苦的. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So *in response to* the social woes 麻烦；问题；困难;痛苦；苦恼；悲伤；悲哀 created by industrialization, some Europeans turned to 求助于 politics and political parties /to create meaningful reform /and to make their lives feel (v.) more fulfilling 令人满足的 and less like a recently expired 过期的 coupon 优惠券. And that brings us to the rise of mass-based 群众基础的 political parties. +

Now political parties weren't necessarily new at this point, but `主` what was new `系` was mass-based political parties. You see, as European nations *extended* 扩大；扩展 _the right to vote_ (n.)投票权 *to* more and more people, political parties had to appeal (v.) to 吸引；呼吁 more voters' interests /in order to win (v.) office. +

[.my2]
此时的政党本身并非新鲜事物，但真正具有划时代意义的是​​"群众型政党"​​的崛起。你看，随着欧洲国家将"投票权"扩大到越来越多的人，政党必须迎合更多选民的利益才能赢得选举。

For example, in England, the Conservative Party 保守党 really only *cared about* the interests of _the landed elite_ 土地贵族, but _the Liberal Party_ 自由党 increasingly represented (v.)代表 the interests of _the working class_. And so /as _more and more of_ the working class gained (v.) _the right to vote_, the Liberal Party grew (v.) in influence and power. +

In the 19th century, the people of England *turned to* the Liberal Party /to enact (v.)颁布；制定法律 policies for _a national education system_  and _public health benefits_ 公共卫生福利. +

`主` Another example of people *attempting (v.) reform* through political parties `系` was Germany's _Social Democratic Party_ 德国社会民主党. This party was built (v.) on _Marxist 马克思主义的 principles_ of _class struggle_ 阶级斗争 and worked (v.) to improve the lives of the German _working class_. +

Now remember what we talked about in another video /when we *dealt with* Marx's understanding of history 马克思对历史的理解. He believed that /class struggle (n.) *would eventually result in* 导致；造成 a violent revolution. There were _Germans_ in the Social Democratic Party _who_ believed (v.) revolution was inevitable 不可避免的, but there was another faction 派别；派系 that believed that /_class struggle_ could *be alleviated* (v.)减轻；缓和 by social reform. +

[.my2]
还记得我们在另一个视频中讲到的马克思对历史的理解吗。他相信阶级斗争最终会导致暴力革命。社会民主党中有德国人认为, 革命是不可避免的; 但也有另一派认为, 阶级斗争可以通过社会改革来缓解。

And they were able to make some modest 适度的；适中的;些许的 gains (n.)收益 for the working class -- _not least_ 尤其，特别是 improved (v.) standards of living and working conditions. +

Now during this time, workers also joined together 连接在一起 in labor unions 工会, which promoted 推动；促进 social and economic reforms. And some of these even *turned into* political parties themselves. And this was especially prominent 显著的；突出的 in England. +

[.my2]
在这一时期，工人们也加入了工会，推动了社会和经济改革。其中一些甚至自己变成了政党。这在英国尤为突出。

After 1870, labor unions gained (v.) the right to strike 罢工. And when they gained the right to strike -- well, they struck (v.)罢工;打；击. In 1888, female workers organized (v.) a strike in the match 火柴 industry. And in 1889, London dock 码头，船埠 workers did the same. +

[.my2]
1888年，火柴行业的女工组织了一次罢工。1889年，伦敦码头工人也做了同样的事情。


By the time World War I *rolled around* 到来,发生;不知不觉就到了, somewhere around  大约,左右 three to four million workers had organized themselves into labor unions in England. And this became (v.) one of the primary 主要的 ways /that workers agitated for 鼓动；煽动 reforms to their wages and their working conditions. +

[.my2]
到第一次世界大战爆发时，英国大约有三到四百万工人组织了工会。这成为工人们要求改革工资和工作条件的主要方式之一。

.somewhere around
​​ ≈ ​​“大约”​​/​​“差不多”​​/​​“介于……之间 +
为什么用 ​​"somewhere"​​ ? 作者用这个词表明 ​​数据来源可能存在浮动​​。

- "The project will cost somewhere between 50,000and70,000."
（这项目预算大约在5万到7万美元之间。）
- "She’s somewhere in her thirties."
（她大概三十多岁。）

这里的 ​​"somewhere"​​ 不是指“某个地方”，而是 ​​模糊化数字的修辞手段​​.

Now in the previous point, we talked about _the Social Democratic Party_ in Germany. But before _this was a political party_ 但在这是一个政党之前, it was two independent _labor unions_ -- namely 即；也就是 _the General German Workers' Association_ 全德工人联合会 and _the Social Democratic Workers' Party_ 社会民主工人党. +

[.my2]
在前一点中，我们谈到了德国的社会民主党。但在它成为一个政党之前，它是两个独立的工会——即德国总工人协会, 和社会民主工人党。

Now it's not *as important* to remember _the names of those individual unions_ *as* it is to remember that /these labor unions merged (v.)合并；融合 *to form (v.) a political party* /that worked (v.) for _the rights of the working class_. +

[.my2]
记住这些工会的名字并不重要，重要的是要记住: 这些工会合并成一个政党，为工人阶级的权利而努力。

Now women also *pressed for* 争取；施压;要求（某事物） legal, economic, and political rights *as well as* improved (v.) working conditions. This *came about* 发生；产生 /in part because `主` women of this age `谓` *were exceedingly 极其；非常 involved in* broader reform movements /that gave them the motivation 动力；动机 to begin (v.) *questioning (v.) their own roles* in society. +

[.my2]
现在，妇女也开始争取法律、经济和政治权利，并改善工作条件。这在一定程度上是因为, 这个年龄段的女性非常积极地参与到更广泛的改革运动中，这给了她们"开始质疑自己在社会中的角色"的动力。

For example, `主` Barbara Smith Bodichon in England `谓` *gathered* (v.) a group of women *together* /who became known as _the Ladies of Langham Place_. They worked together *to extend* (v.) voting rights *to* women /and to recognize 承认 women's rights to _property (n.) apart from their husbands_. +

[.my2]
例如，英国的芭芭拉·史密斯·博迪肯（Barbara Smith Bodichon）召集了一群妇女，她们被称为朗廷广场的女士们。他们共同努力将投票权扩大到妇女，并承认妇女在丈夫之外的财产权利。 +
(以英国为例，芭芭拉·史密斯·博迪尚（Barbara Smith Bodichon）集结了一群女性，她们后来以"朗廷广场女士"（Ladies of Langham Place）之名著称。这个团体致力于推动两项重要改革：一是争取女性选举权，二是确立女性独立于丈夫之外的财产权。)

.The Ladies of Langham Place
Gemini: +
"The Ladies of Langham Place" (或 "Langham Place Group") 是指19世纪中叶英国一个非常重要的女性权利倡导团体。她们由芭芭拉·史密斯·博迪雄（Barbara Smith Bodichon）召集，并在伦敦的**朗汉姆坊19号（19 Langham Place）**设立了总部，因此得名。

这个团体是英国早期女性主义运动的核心力量之一，致力于推动多项重要的女性权利改革。

主要特点和贡献：

|女性权益倡导的中心：
|朗汉姆坊19号不仅是她们的办公室，也成为一个女性活动中心，提供阅读室、咖啡馆和会议空间，为当时致力于女性权利的各类倡议提供支持。它被视为当时伦敦男士俱乐部（gentlemen's clubs）的女性对应版本。


|多方面的改革：
|她们的努力不仅仅局限于投票权和财产权，还包括：

- 女性受教育权： 积极推动女性获得高等教育的机会。例如，艾米丽·戴维斯 (Emily Davies) 是该团体的重要成员，她后来创立了剑桥大学的格顿学院（Girton College），是英国最早的女子学院之一。

- 女性就业机会： 她们认识到许多女性（尤其是中产阶级女性）需要工作来维持生计，但职业选择非常有限。她们成立了“促进女性就业协会”（Society for Promoting the Employment of Women），开办培训课程（如簿记、速记），并积极为女性寻找就业机会，甚至创立了由女性经营的印刷厂——维多利亚出版社 (Victoria Press)。

- 已婚女性财产权： 这是她们最早也是最重要的倡议之一。*在当时的英国法律下，已婚女性的财产和收入都归丈夫所有。她们积极推动修改法律，争取已婚女性的独立财产权，这最终促成了《已婚女性财产法》的通过。*

废除对女性有害的法律： 例如，她们也曾反对《传染病法》，该法案歧视性地针对女性。

|出版物：
|《英国女性杂志》(The English Woman's Journal)： 1858年，芭芭拉·博迪雄和贝茜·雷纳·帕克斯（Bessie Rayner Parkes）共同创办了这份杂志，它成为朗汉姆坊团体宣传其改革理念、讨论女性就业和教育问题、以及提升女性意识的重要平台。

|===

总之，"The Ladies of Langham Place" 是19世纪英国女性权利运动的先驱和核心，她们通过集会、出版、法律请愿和实际行动，为后来的女性参政权运动和更广泛的女性解放运动奠定了重要基础。

We talked about Flora Tristan (法国女权主义者和活动家) in another video, but by way of reminder, she worked for women's equality in France. And since she was a utopian socialist 空想社会主义者, her ideas didn't really seem (v.) workable 可行的 in the real world, and thus her ideas remained confined to 局限于 the margins of society. +

But building on 以…为基础 Tristan's work, the Women's Social and Political Union 妇女社会政治联盟 emerged (v.) in Britain in the early 20th century. It was created by the Pankhurst （某姓氏） family, who organized mass rallies 大规模集会 for women's equality. +

The most significant rally 集会，大会 for women's suffrage 选举权；投票权 occurred in 1908 in London's Hyde Park. In response, police attacked the demonstrators 示威者 and jailed (v.) no small number 监禁了不少人. But the Pankhursts continued *fighting for* women's suffrage -- a fight that eventually pressured (v.) Britain's Liberal Party to add (v.) that issue 议题，争论点 to their platform 纲领；政纲. +

As a result, in 1888, the British Parliament 议会 passed a law /enabling (v.)使能够；使有机会 _men over 21_ to vote (v.) /and _women over the age of 30_ to vote (v.). So yeah, baby steps (婴儿的步骤,非常小的一步或进展) 循序渐进的努力. +

Additionally, let's talk about people /who sought to reform (v.) society *based on* their religious principles.  +

One of the most notable 显著的；著名的 was _the Sunday School movement_ 主日学校运动, which aimed to provide (v.) education for working-class children. And most of the teaching was done by women. +
The movement was a massive success. And as adults brought (v.) their children to learn (v.) reading, writing, and arithmetic 算术, the adults themselves learned (v.) too -- all *leading to* a more literate (a.)有文化的；有读写能力的 and empowered 获得权力的；被赋予权力的 society. +

.empowered society
此处的 ​​"empowered society"​​ 应译为 ​​"具有自主能力的社会"​​ 或 ​​"赋权型社会"​​，其核心含义是指：​​通过普及教育使民众获得知识技能后，能够主动掌握自身命运、参与社会决策的进步社会形态​​。


.Sunday school  主日学校
欧洲的"主日学校"始于天主教会的基督教教义会 ，该会由大主教查尔斯·博罗梅奥于 16 世纪创立，旨在向意大利儿童传授信仰。 +
Protestant Sunday schools 新教徒主日学校, 最早于 18 世纪在英国建立，旨在为劳动儿童提供教育。

罗伯特·雷克斯于 1781 年在英国格洛斯特创办了一所类似的学校。这些学校旨在教授年轻人阅读、写作、计算（做算术）和圣经知识。  +
*1870 年英国《教育法》 颁布后，主日学校的教育作用终止了 ，该法规定普及初等教育。* 到了 20 世纪 60 年代， “主日学校” 一词可能指的是建筑物，而很少指里面的活动。到了 20 世纪 70 年代，即使是最大的主日学校也被拆除了。 +
*今天，这个词主要指在教堂礼拜开始前, 为儿童和成人开设的教义问答课。*

== 中文释义

好的，我们已经确定"工业革命"是世界变革的主要力量。但对于很多人来说，这种变革让情况变得更糟。所以在这个视频中，我们需要谈谈19世纪的所有改革，这些改革试图让那些人的生活不那么悲惨。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

**#为了应对"工业化"带来的社会问题，一些欧洲人转向政治和政党，希望进行有意义的改革，#**让他们的生活更充实，而不是像一张刚刚过期的优惠券那样毫无价值。*这就引出了群众基础政党的兴起。*  +

*#在这个时期，政党本身并不是什么新鲜事物，但"基于群众基础的政党"却是新出现的。你看，随着欧洲国家将选举权扩大到越来越多的人，政党为了赢得执政地位，不得不迎合更多选民的利益。#*  +

例如，*在英国，保守党（Conservative Party）实际上只关心土地贵族的利益，而自由党（Liberal Party）则越来越多地代表工人阶级的利益。所以，随着越来越多的工人阶级获得选举权，自由党的影响力和权力也在增长。*  +

在19世纪，英国人民依靠自由党, 来制定国家教育体系和公共卫生福利方面的政策。  +

人们通过"政党"进行改革的另一个例子, 是德国的"社会民主党"（Social Democratic Party）。这个政党建立在马克思的阶级斗争原则之上，致力于改善德国工人阶级的生活。  +

还记得我们在另一个视频中谈到的马克思对历史的理解吗？他认为"阶级斗争"最终会导致一场暴力革命。*德国"社会民主党"中的一些人认为, 革命是不可避免的，但另一个派别则认为, 阶级斗争可以通过社会改革得到缓解。*  +

他们为工人阶级取得了一些适度的成果——至少改善了生活和工作条件。  +

在这个时期，工人们还联合起来成立了"工会"（labor unions），推动社会和经济改革。*其中一些工会甚至自身转变为政党(工党)。这在英国尤为突出。*  +

**1870年之后，工会获得了罢工的权利。**当他们获得罢工权利后——嗯，他们就举行了罢工。1888年，女工们在火柴行业组织了一次罢工。1889年，伦敦码头工人也进行了罢工。  +

到"第一次世界大战"爆发时，英国大约有三四百万工人加入了工会。这成为工人们争取工资和工作条件改革的主要方式之一。  +

之前我们谈到了德国的社会民主党。但在它成为一个政党之前，它是两个独立的工会——即德国工人总协会（General German Workers' Association）和社会民主工人党（Social Democratic Workers' Party）。  +

记住这些单个工会的名字并不那么重要，重要的是要记住**这些工会合并成了一个为工人阶级争取权利的政党。**  +

**女性也为争取法律、经济和政治权利以, 及改善工作条件而努力。**这在一定程度上是因为, 这个时代的女性大量参与了更广泛的改革运动，这让她们有动力开始质疑自己在社会中的角色。  +

例如，英国的芭芭拉·史密斯·博迪雄（Barbara Smith Bodichon）召集了一群女性，她们被称为兰厄姆广场的女士们（the Ladies of Langham Place）。她们共同努力，争取将选举权扩大到女性，并认可女性独立于丈夫的财产权。  +

我们在另一个视频中谈到了弗洛拉·特里斯坦（Flora Tristan），但提醒一下，她在法国为女性平等而努力。*由于她是一个"空想社会主义者"，她的想法在现实世界中并不太可行，因此她的想法仍然处于社会的边缘。*  +

但在特里斯坦工作的基础上，妇女社会政治联盟（Women's Social and Political Union）于20世纪初在英国成立。它由潘克赫斯特（Pankhurst）家族创建，该家族组织了大规模的争取女性平等的集会。  +

争取女性选举权的最重大集会, 于1908年在伦敦的海德公园（Hyde Park）举行。作为回应，警察攻击了示威者，并监禁了不少人。但**潘克赫斯特家族继续为女性选举权而斗争——这场斗争最终迫使英国"自由党"将这个问题纳入他们的纲领。**  +

**结果，1918年，英国议会通过了一项法律，使21岁以上的男性, 和30岁以上的女性, 获得了选举权。**所以，这是渐进的进步。  +

此外，让我们谈谈**那些基于宗教原则, 寻求社会改革的人。其中最著名的是"主日学校运动"（the Sunday School movement），该运动旨在为工人阶级的孩子提供教育。大部分教学工作是由女性完成的。(欧洲各个政治团体, 为各人民子集(工人, 女人, 儿童等)争取各种权益的运动, 风起云涌. 多亏了他们的努力, 很多权益才都成功实现了. 中国呢? 有多空白?)**  +

这项运动取得了巨大的成功。当成年人带着他们的孩子去学习阅读、写作和算术时，成年人自己也在学习——这一切都促进了一个文化水平更高、更有能力的社会的形成。  +

此外，废奴运动（abolitionist movement）致力于废除奴隶制。这项运动在英国最为成功，在威廉·威尔伯福斯（William Wilberforce）的废奴工作基础上，到1838年，奴隶制在大英帝国被废除。  +

All right, we've already established that the Industrial Revolution was a major force of change in the world. But for a lot of people, that change was for the worse. So in this video, we need to talk about all the reforms in the 19th century that attempted to make those people's lives a little less miserable. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

So in response to the social woes created by industrialization, some Europeans turned to politics and political parties to create meaningful reform and to make their lives feel more fulfilling and less like a recently expired coupon. And that brings us to the rise of mass-based political parties.

Now political parties weren't necessarily new at this point, but what was new was mass-based political parties. You see, as European nations extended the right to vote to more and more people, political parties had to appeal to more voters' interests in order to win office.

For example, in England, the Conservative Party really only cared about the interests of the landed elite, but the Liberal Party increasingly represented the interests of the working class. And so as more and more of the working class gained the right to vote, the Liberal Party grew in influence and power.

In the 19th century, the people of England turned to the Liberal Party to enact policies for a national education system and public health benefits.

Another example of people attempting reform through political parties was Germany's Social Democratic Party. This party was built on Marxist principles of class struggle and worked to improve the lives of the German working class.

Now remember what we talked about in another video when we dealt with Marx's understanding of history. He believed that class struggle would eventually result in a violent revolution. There were Germans in the Social Democratic Party who believed revolution was inevitable, but there was another faction that believed that class struggle could be alleviated by social reform.

And they were able to make some modest gains for the working class -- not least improved standards of living and working conditions.

Now during this time, workers also joined together in labor unions, which promoted social and economic reforms. And some of these even turned into political parties themselves. And this was especially prominent in England.

After 1870, labor unions gained the right to strike. And when they gained the right to strike -- well, they struck. In 1888, female workers organized a strike in the match industry. And in 1889, London dock workers did the same.

By the time World War I rolled around, somewhere around three to four million workers had organized themselves into labor unions in England. And this became one of the primary ways that workers agitated for reforms to their wages and their working conditions.

Now in the previous point, we talked about the Social Democratic Party in Germany. But before this was a political party, it was two independent labor unions -- namely the General German Workers' Association and the Social Democratic Workers' Party.

Now it's not as important to remember the names of those individual unions as it is to remember that these labor unions merged to form a political party that worked for the rights of the working class.

Now women also pressed for legal, economic, and political rights as well as improved working conditions. This came about in part because women of this age were exceedingly involved in broader reform movements that gave them the motivation to begin questioning their own roles in society.

For example, Barbara Smith Bodichon in England gathered a group of women together who became known as the Ladies of Langham Place. They worked together to extend voting rights to women and to recognize women's rights to property apart from their husbands.

We talked about Flora Tristan in another video, but by way of reminder, she worked for women's equality in France. And since she was a utopian socialist, her ideas didn't really seem workable in the real world, and thus her ideas remained confined to the margins of society.

But building on Tristan's work, the Women's Social and Political Union emerged in Britain in the early 20th century. It was created by the Pankhurst family, who organized mass rallies for women's equality.

The most significant rally for women's suffrage occurred in 1908 in London's Hyde Park. In response, police attacked the demonstrators and jailed no small number. But the Pankhursts continued fighting for women's suffrage -- a fight that eventually pressured Britain's Liberal Party to add that issue to their platform.

As a result, in 1918, the British Parliament passed a law enabling men over 21 to vote and women over the age of 30 to vote. So yeah, baby steps.

Additionally, let's talk about people who sought to reform society based on their religious principles. One of the most notable was the Sunday School movement, which aimed to provide education for working-class children. And most of the teaching was done by women.

The movement was a massive success. And as adults brought their children to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic, the adults themselves learned too -- all leading to a more literate and empowered society.
