== 释义

Now I haven't mentioned /in my previous videos, but World War One was first known as the Great War /or the war 后定说明 to end (v.) all wars. But `主` the fact that we know it as World War One `谓` makes the spoiler 剧透；泄露 pretty obvious 相当明显 -- there was _in fact_ a World War II. Now we're going *to deal with* that war /in the next video, but in this one, let's look at `主` the factors 因素 /后定说明 that made `宾` the war to end (v.) all wars `宾补` just an appetizer 开胃菜；前菜 to the next great one. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked appeasement 绥靖；姑息 style, then let's get to it. +

[.my2]
在之前的视频中我并未提及这一点，但第一次世界大战最初被称为“大战”或“终结所有战争的战争”。但我们将其称为第一次世界大战这一事实，使得这个剧透内容变得相当明显——实际上还有一场第二次世界大战。接下来的视频中我们会探讨这场战争，但在这一集里，让我们先看看那些使得这场终结所有战争的战争, 仅仅只是下一场更大战争的前奏的因素。

[.my1]
.案例

.that made `宾` the war to end (v.) all wars `宾补` just an appetizer 开胃菜；前菜 to the next great one.
*这里是​"make + 宾语 + 补足语"​​ 结构, 即  ​​"made the war... an appetizer"​​*. +
made​​ 是谓语动词（“使…成为”），直接连接宾语（the war）和补足语（an appetizer）。
====

Coming out of 从某个地方或某种经历中出现或产生 World War One, there were a lot of complex factors /that allowed fascist states *both* to re-arm (v.)重新武装 themselves *and* expand (v.) their terror.  +

Now remember, Germany was on _the losing side_ of World War One, and part of _the Treaty of Versailles_ 凡尔赛条约 mandated (v.) 强制；命令;授权 that Germany demilitarized (v.) 非军事化 /and another part shrank (v.) 缩小；缩减 their territory. So `主` reversing (v.) 颠倒，推翻；撤销 either （两者之中）任意一个 of those realities 现实 `系` was a violation 违反；违背 of the treaty, and if Germany violated (v.) that treaty, it would likely *lead to* another war.  +
And yet, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, Germany significantly rearmed (v.) itself /and began conquering (v.) 征服；占领 territory like a madman 疯子，狂人；精神病患者. So how did he do it? +

[.my2]
而《凡尔赛条约》的部分条款规定德国必须裁军，另一部分则缩减了其领土。因此，要改变这两种状况, 都是对条约的违背.

The first reason this could happen `系` was because of _the policy of appeasement_ (n.平息，安抚，姑息)绥靖政策 towards Germany. Britain and France were the main appeasers 绥靖者,劝解人.  +
As I mentioned in the video on World War One, `主` the human and capital 资本，资金;死刑的 cost of that war `系` was staggering 大得惊人的，令人吃惊的;令人震惊的；难以想象的 to all involved. 那场战争所造成的人员伤亡和经济损失, 对所有参与方来说都是极其惨重的。 So when Hitler began publicly re-arming (v.) Germany in 1935 /and taking territory thereafter <正式>其后，此后, Britain and France were not *too* eager *to start* (v.) another war /to stop him. The policy of appeasement essentially became 基本上成为: let Hitler do whatever he wants /because we're not destroying ourselves in another cataclysmic 灾难性的 battle yet again. In other words, Hitler faced no consequences /for breaking the provisions 条款；规定 in the Treaty of Versailles /that kept Germany powerless in the interwar  (a.)两次战争之间的 period. +

.The first reason this could happen `系` was *because of* the policy of appeasement 绥靖政策 towards Germany.

“Because” 是连接词，后面接完整的句子； +
“because of” 是介词短语，后面接名词、代词或动名词。﻿

I was late *because* I missed the bus.
我迟到了，因为我错过了公共汽车。 +
I was late *because of* the bus.
我因为赶不上公交车而迟到了。
====

Now the second reason Germany was able to re-arm (v.) and start expanding `系` was because of the growing antagonism  敌对，敌意，对立情绪；（对主张、计划等的）反对 and distrust *between* the Soviet Union *and* the Western European states slash 或者,以及,斜线；和 the United States.  +
Recall (v.)回想；回忆起 that /the Soviet Union was an authoritarian 独裁的；专制的 communist state 共产主义国家, and that was diametrically 完全（不同）；截然（相反） opposed to 与……截然相反 the U.S. and Western Europe, which represented capitalist democracy 资本主义民主. We'll get more into that antagonism and distrust /in Unit 9 during the Cold War, but for now, all you have to know is that /these two entities 实体；实体组织 were *so* opposed 相反的，对立的;强烈反对 to one another *that* they could not work together /to present a united front 统一战线 against expanding fascist states. And I say states plural 复数的 /because even though I've only been referring to 提到；谈及；说起 Germany, fascist Italy was expanding too. And you know, let's talk about that. +

[.my2]
现在，德国得以重新武装并开始扩张的第二个原因在于，苏联与西欧国家（包括美国）之间的敌对情绪和不信任感, 日益加剧。要知道，苏联是一个专制的共产主义国家，与美国和西欧（代表着资本主义民主）截然不同。我们将在冷战时期的第 9 课中进一步探讨这种敌对和不信任关系，但现在你只需要知道，这两个实体之间分歧极大，以至于它们无法携手形成统一战线来对抗不断扩张的法西斯国家。而且我说的“这些国家”是复数形式，因为尽管我只提到的是德国，但法西斯意大利也在扩张。接下来，咱们来谈谈这个情况吧。

Okay, and here we need to talk about the specific actions 具体行动 /that led to World War II. First, let's *get specific with* 具体讨论/详细分析（某个主题） territorial expansion 领土扩张.  +

.let’s *get specific with* territorial expansion.
"get specific with"​​ 的意思是 ​​“具体讨论/详细分析（某个主题）”​​，强调从概括性描述转向​​具体细节​​或​​实例说明​​。 +

get specific​​ = 具体化、深入细节 +
with​​ + 主题 = 关于某个领域

In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia, which happened to be 碰巧是 only one of two African states /that had never been colonized by Europeans. If you've been around /since we talked about the Scramble for Africa 非洲争夺战, then you know /that is a big deal.
Anyway, Italy was ultimately successful /in conquering Ethiopia, and `主` that victory `谓` made Britain a little sweaty 出汗的 /because it threatened their control of the Suez Canal 苏伊士运河 in Egypt. And remember, nobody wants to start another war, and so /`主` the only reprisal (n.)报复；复仇 Mussolini faced for this attack `系` was a few lame 无力的；无价值的 economic sanctions 经济制裁 /imposed by the League of Nations. +

But Germany's territorial expansion `谓` made Italy's efforts look like _child's play_ 小菜一碟,轻而易举的事；儿戏.

Hitler began by re-militarizing  (v.)再武装，再军备 the Rhineland 莱茵兰, which is _this little strip of land_ right here 就是这一小块地. `主` This act `系` was kind of like an experiment 实验，试验 for Hitler. `主` The Treaty of Versailles `谓` specifically prohibited 禁止；阻止 German armament 武装；军备 of this territory, so Hitler wanted to see /if Britain and France were *up for fighting* 准备战斗. So in 1936, Hitler sent troops to occupy (v.) the Rhineland, and because of _the policy of appeasement_ /that I mentioned earlier, all he heard from Britain and France was, "Hitler, stop." Upon 在……上 seeing that Britain and France would do nothing to enforce (v.)执行；实施 the treaty  （国家之间的）条约，协定, Hitler was like, "Oh, it's on 这下可来劲了/好戏开始了." +

Next, in 1938, Hitler annexed (v.)吞并；兼并 Austria, a move known as Anschluss 德奥合并 /*on account of* 因为；由于 all the Germans living in Austria 所有住在奥地利的德国人.  And once German troops came into Austria, they decided to hold a little vote /to hear _from the Austrians_ *whether or not* they wanted to be absorbed into the German Reich 德国；德意志帝国. And wouldn't you know it, like 99% of Austrians voted (v.) yes to the annexation.  +
Hold on, you're trying to tell me that /`主` _an independent nation_ in the age of 在……时代 self-determination 自决权 `谓` *decided* by a margin 边缘；极限；界限 of 99% *that* /they wanted to be taken over? Does that smell (v.) funky 恶臭的, 时髦独特的,可疑的；有问题的 to anybody else? I mean, think about it: when have you ever heard of _99% of people_ in any country in any age in any part of the world *agreeing 达成一致 on* something? That does not happen. +

[.my2]
接下来，在 1938 年，希特勒吞并了奥地利，这一举动被称为“合并”，因为当时奥地利居住着大量德国人。一旦德国军队进入奥地利，他们便决定举行一次小型投票，以了解奥地利人是否愿意被纳入德意志帝国。你猜怎么着？大约 99%的奥地利人投票赞成合并。等等，你这是要告诉我，在一个主张自主决定的年代，一个独立的国家竟然以 99%的票数决定要被吞并？这难道不是让人觉得怪怪的吗？我想大家应该都能理解：在任何国家、任何时代、任何地方，难道有 99%的人会一致同意某件事吗？这种事情是不会发生的。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Does that smell funky to anybody else?
funky本指音乐风格（放克音乐）或气味（浓烈、古怪），但在非正式语境中常引申为 ​​“奇怪的、不可信的”​​。

类似表达对比：

- "fishy"​​ （有鱼腥味的;可疑的，更常见）  +
The results seem fishy (a.).（结果看起来很可疑。） +
- "sketchy"​​ （素描似的;不靠谱的;粗略的；概略的；不完备的） +
His explanation was sketchy.（他的解释很牵强。） +
- "off"​​ （不对劲的） +
Something feels off about this.（这事感觉有问题。） +

====

So that vote did indeed smell (v.) funky, and here's why.  +
First of all, look at this ballot 选票；投票. You don't even have to speak German /to know that `主` the "yes" circle `系` is a little** out of proportion to** 与……不成比例 the "no" circle.

[.my2]
即便你不懂德语，也能看出“赞成”圈的大小, 明显大于“反对”圈。

Second, this was not a secret ballot 这不是无记名投票. In order to vote, you had to *hand* it *to* a German military officer /who would then place it in the box. So it was a rigged  （以不正当的手段）操纵,操纵的；作弊的; 装有（船的）索具的 vote without a doubt.

[.my2]
其次，这不是秘密投票。为了投票，你得把选票交给一名德国军官，然后由他将其放入投票箱。所以这无疑是一次被操纵的投票。

But Hitler was successful nonetheless 尽管如此；仍然. And then he *went on* to take over the Sudetenland 苏台德地区 and a few states in Czechoslovakia 捷克斯洛伐克 as well.  +
And in all of this 在整个过程中, Britain and France essentially did nothing to stop it. But what they did do `系` is gather (v.)聚集，召集 at a meeting /and create the Munich Agreement 慕尼黑协定, in which Britain and France agreed to _all of Hitler's territorial demands_ /but made him promise (v.) that /he would take no more. And Hitler was like, "Yeah, sure." +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Munich Agreement
慕尼黑协定（Munich Agreement）是二战前夕在1938年9月30日签署的一项重要协议，主要内容是允许纳粹德国吞并捷克斯洛伐克的苏台德地区（Sudetenland）。

协定背景
苏台德地区, 是捷克斯洛伐克靠近德国边界的一个区域，居住着大量德裔居民。希特勒利用当地德裔居民的民族主义情绪，宣称他们受到了捷克斯洛伐克政府的“迫害”，以此作为吞并苏台德地区的借口。他威胁如果要求得不到满足，德国将对捷克斯洛伐克发动战争。

image:/img/Sudetenland.jpg[,100%]





这次会议在慕尼黑举行，参与签署协定的有四个国家的首脑： +
英国：首相内维尔·张伯伦（Neville Chamberlain） +
法国：总理爱德华·达拉第（Édouard Daladier） +
德国：元首阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler） +
意大利：领袖贝尼托·墨索里尼（Benito Mussolini）

令人惊讶的是，**捷克斯洛伐克的代表没有被允许参与会议。**协定的核心内容是，英法两国同意德国立即占领苏台德地区，以此换取希特勒关于“不再有进一步领土要求”的承诺。

协定的后果与评价:  +
**慕尼黑协定被普遍认为是"绥靖政策"（appeasement）的典型代表，即**西方大国为了避免战争而对希特勒的侵略行为做出让步。

当时积极方的看法：当时的英国首相张伯伦回到伦敦后，举着协定文本，宣称他为英国带来了“一代人的和平”（Peace for our time）。许多人一度认为，这是避免一场毁灭性战争的明智之举。

批评方的看法：然而，历史证明这是一个巨大的错误。协定并没有带来和平，反而鼓励了希特勒的野心。吞并苏台德地区后，德国的实力大大增强，而捷克斯洛伐克的国防能力则被严重削弱。**不到半年，希特勒就撕毁了协定，占领了整个捷克斯洛伐克，**最终导致了1939年德国入侵波兰和第二次世界大战的全面爆发。

因此，慕尼黑协定被后世广泛批评为“出卖”了捷克斯洛伐克，并被视为西方大国在面对侵略时软弱和短视的象征。

Additionally, Hitler made peace 与某人和解 with the Soviet Union /in something called _the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact_ 德苏互不侵犯条约,纳粹-苏联互不侵犯条约, in which they agreed to two stipulations 条款；规定: first, neither would attack (v.) the other for a decade 十年期 following the agreement; second, they agreed to split (v.)（使）分裂 Poland between the two powers. And `主` that second stipulation `谓` gave Hitler the confidence to invade Poland, knowing that /the Soviet Union would not oppose him.  +
In 1939, that is exactly what Hitler did. And why wouldn't he? Even though he *committed* in the Munich Agreement *that* he would not seek (v.) any more territory, he had been taking territory all over Europe /and no one was stopping him. So why would it be any different /in Poland? +

[.my2]
尽管他在慕尼黑协议中承诺不再谋求更多领土，但他一直在欧洲各地侵占领土，而且无人能阻止他。那么在波兰的情况又会有什么不同呢？

But here's where I tell you that /it was different in Poland, because that invasion was the last straw 最后一根稻草；忍无可忍的事 for Britain and France. So as a result of that invasion, Britain and France *declared war on* Germany, and that is how you get World War II. +

== 中文释义

在我之前的视频里我没提过，但第一次世界大战最初被称为“大战”或者“终结所有战争的战争”。但我们现在称它为“第一次世界大战”，这就很明显地剧透了 —— 实际上还有第二次世界大战（World War II）。我们将在下一个视频中探讨第二次世界大战，但在这个视频里，咱们来看看是什么因素让这场“终结所有战争的战争”仅仅成了下一场大战的开胃菜。所以，如果你准备好以“绥靖政策”的视角来获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

第一次世界大战结束后，有许多复杂的因素, 使得法西斯国家得以重新武装并扩张其恐怖统治。记住，德国是第一次世界大战的战败国，*《凡尔赛条约》*（Treaty of Versailles）的部分条款强制要求德国裁军，另一部分条款则使其领土缩减。所以，**改变这些既定事实中的任何一个, 都算是违反条约，如果德国违反条约，很可能会引发另一场战争。然而，在阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）的领导下，德国大力重整军备，开始像疯子一样占领领土。**那他是怎么做到的呢？ +

*这种情况发生的第一个原因, 是对德国的"绥靖政策"*（policy of appeasement）。**英国和法国是主要推行"绥靖政策"的国家。**正如我在关于第一次世界大战的视频中提到的，那场战争给所有参战国带来的人员和资本损失是惊人的。所以当希特勒在1935年开始公开为德国重新武装，并在此后占领领土时，英国和法国并不太愿意发动另一场战争来阻止他。绥靖政策本质上变成了：随希特勒怎么做吧，因为我们不想再在另一场灾难性的战争中自我毁灭。换句话说，**希特勒违反《凡尔赛条约》中那些**在两次世界大战之间**削弱德国的条款，却没有受到任何惩罚。** +

**德国能够重新武装并开始扩张的第二个原因, 是"苏联"与"西欧国家以及美国"之间日益加剧的敌对和不信任。**回想一下，苏联是一个专制的共产主义国家，这与代表"资本主义民主"的美国和西欧截然对立。我们将在第9单元冷战时期的内容中, 深入探讨这种敌对和不信任，但现在你只需要知道，**这两个阵营彼此对立，无法携手组成统一战线来对抗扩张的法西斯国家。**我说“国家”是复数形式，因为尽管我一直只提到德国，但法西斯意大利也在扩张。我们来聊聊这个。 +

好，现在我们需要谈谈**导致第二次世界大战的具体事件。**首先，我们具体说说领土扩张。**1935年，意大利入侵埃塞俄比亚（Ethiopia），埃塞俄比亚恰好是仅有的两个从未被欧洲人殖民过的非洲国家之一。**如果你从我们讨论“瓜分非洲”（Scramble for Africa）的时候就在关注的话，就会知道这是一件大事。总之，**#意大利最终成功征服了埃塞俄比亚，这次胜利让英国有些不安，因为这威胁到了他们对埃及苏伊士运河（Suez Canal）的控制。#**而且记住，*没人想再发动一场战争，所以墨索里尼（Mussolini）因这次侵略行为所面临的唯一报复，只是"国际联盟"（League of Nations）实施的一些无力的经济制裁。* +

但德国的领土扩张相比之下，让意大利的所作所为就像小孩子过家家。**希特勒首先让莱茵兰（Rhineland）重新军事化，**就是这边的这条狭长地带。**这一举动对希特勒来说有点像一次试探。《凡尔赛条约》明确禁止德国在该地区驻军，所以希特勒想看看英国和法国是否会为此开战。于是在1936年，希特勒派兵占领莱茵兰，**由于我之前提到的绥靖政策，他只听到英国和法国说：“希特勒，住手。” **看到英国和法国不会采取任何行动来执行条约，**希特勒心想：“哦，机会来了。” +

接下来，1938年，**希特勒吞并了奥地利（Austria），由于奥地利有很多德国人，这一行动被称为“德奥合并”（Anschluss）。一旦德国军队进入奥地利，他们决定举行一次小投票，询问奥地利人是否愿意被并入德意志帝国（German Reich）。你猜怎么着，大概99%的奥地利人投票赞成吞并。**等一下，你是想告诉我，**在民族自决的时代，一个独立国家以99%的比例决定被接管？**其他人不觉得这很可疑吗？我是说，*想想看：你什么时候听说过世界上任何时代、任何国家的99%的人能在某件事上达成一致？这根本不可能。* +
所以这次投票确实有问题，原因如下。首先，**看看这张选票。你甚至不需要懂德语，就能看出“赞成”的圈比“反对”的圈大得不成比例。**其次，这不是无记名投票。**为了投票，你必须把选票交给一名德国军官，然后由他放入投票箱。所以这无疑是一场被操纵的投票。**但不管怎样，*希特勒成功了。* +

*然后他又继续占领了苏台德地区（Sudetenland）和捷克斯洛伐克（Czechoslovakia）的几个州。在这一系列事件中，英国和法国基本上没有采取任何行动来阻止。但他们做的是召开会议并签署了《慕尼黑协定》（Munich Agreement），在协定中，英国和法国同意了希特勒所有的领土要求，但让他承诺不再索取更多领土。希特勒说：“当然可以。”* +

此外，*希特勒与苏联签署了《纳粹 - 苏联互不侵犯条约》*（Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact），**达成了两项规定：第一，双方在条约签署后的十年内, 互不攻击；第二，他们同意瓜分波兰（Poland）。**第二项规定让希特勒有了入侵波兰的底气，因为他知道苏联不会反对。1939年，希特勒正是这么做的。他为什么不呢？*尽管他在《慕尼黑协定》中承诺不再寻求更多领土，但他一直在欧洲各地占领领土，却没有人阻止他。所以在波兰这件事上，又怎么会有不同呢？* +

但我要告诉你，*#在波兰这件事上情况确实不同了，因为这次入侵, 成了压垮英国和法国的最后一根稻草。因此，作为这次入侵的结果，英国和法国向德国宣战，第二次世界大战就这样爆发了。#* +

Now I haven't mentioned in my previous videos, but World War One was first known as the Great War or the war to end all wars. But the fact that we know it as World War One makes the spoiler pretty obvious -- there was in fact a World War II. Now we're going to deal with that war in the next video, but in this one, let's look at the factors that made the war to end all wars just an appetizer to the next great one. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked appeasement style, then let's get to it.

Coming out of World War One, there were a lot of complex factors that allowed fascist states both to re-arm themselves and expand their terror. Now remember, Germany was on the losing side of World War One, and part of the Treaty of Versailles mandated that Germany demilitarized and another part shrank their territory. So reversing either of those realities was a violation of the treaty, and if Germany violated that treaty, it would likely lead to another war. And yet, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, Germany significantly rearmed itself and began conquering territory like a madman. So how did he do it?

The first reason this could happen was because of the policy of appeasement towards Germany. Britain and France were the main appeasers. As I mentioned in the video on World War One, the human and capital cost of that war was staggering to all involved. So when Hitler began publicly re-arming Germany in 1935 and taking territory thereafter, Britain and France were not too eager to start another war to stop him. The policy of appeasement essentially became: let Hitler do whatever he wants because we're not destroying ourselves in another cataclysmic battle yet again. In other words, Hitler faced no consequences for breaking the provisions in the Treaty of Versailles that kept Germany powerless in the interwar period.

Now the second reason Germany was able to re-arm and start expanding was because of the growing antagonism and distrust between the Soviet Union and the Western European states slash the United States. Recall that the Soviet Union was an authoritarian communist state, and that was diametrically opposed to the U.S. and Western Europe, which represented capitalist democracy. We'll get more into that antagonism and distrust in Unit 9 during the Cold War, but for now, all you have to know is that these two entities were so opposed to one another that they could not work together to present a united front against expanding fascist states. And I say states plural because even though I've only been referring to Germany, fascist Italy was expanding too. And you know, let's talk about that.

Okay, and here we need to talk about the specific actions that led to World War II. First, let's get specific with territorial expansion. In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia, which happened to be only one of two African states that had never been colonized by Europeans. If you've been around since we talked about the Scramble for Africa, then you know that is a big deal. Anyway, Italy was ultimately successful in conquering Ethiopia, and that victory made Britain a little sweaty because it threatened their control of the Suez Canal in Egypt. And remember, nobody wants to start another war, and so the only reprisal Mussolini faced for this attack was a few lame economic sanctions imposed by the League of Nations.

But Germany's territorial expansion made Italy's efforts look like child's play. Hitler began by re-militarizing the Rhineland, which is this little strip of land right here. This act was kind of like an experiment for Hitler. The Treaty of Versailles specifically prohibited German armament of this territory, so Hitler wanted to see if Britain and France were up for fighting. So in 1936, Hitler sent troops to occupy the Rhineland, and because of the policy of appeasement that I mentioned earlier, all he heard from Britain and France was, "Hitler, stop." Upon seeing that Britain and France would do nothing to enforce the treaty, Hitler was like, "Oh, it's on."

Next, in 1938, Hitler annexed Austria, a move known as Anschluss on account of all the Germans living in Austria. And once German troops came into Austria, they decided to hold a little vote to hear from the Austrians whether or not they wanted to be absorbed into the German Reich. And wouldn't you know it, like 99% of Austrians voted yes to the annexation. Hold on, you're trying to tell me that an independent nation in the age of self-determination decided by a margin of 99% that they wanted to be taken over? Does that smell funky to anybody else? I mean, think about it: when have you ever heard of 99% of people in any country in any age in any part of the world agreeing on something? That does not happen.

So that vote did indeed smell funky, and here's why. First of all, look at this ballot. You don't even have to speak German to know that the "yes" circle is a little out of proportion to the "no" circle. Second, this was not a secret ballot. In order to vote, you had to hand it to a German military officer who would then place it in the box. So it was a rigged vote without a doubt. But Hitler was successful nonetheless. And then he went on to take over the Sudetenland and a few states in Czechoslovakia as well. And in all of this, Britain and France essentially did nothing to stop it. But what they did do is gather at a meeting and create the Munich Agreement, in which Britain and France agreed to all of Hitler's territorial demands but made him promise that he would take no more. And Hitler was like, "Yeah, sure."

Additionally, Hitler made peace with the Soviet Union in something called the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, in which they agreed to two stipulations: first, neither would attack the other for a decade following the agreement; second, they agreed to split Poland between the two powers. And that second stipulation gave Hitler the confidence to invade Poland, knowing that the Soviet Union would not oppose him. In 1939, that is exactly what Hitler did. And why wouldn't he? Even though he committed in the Munich Agreement that he would not seek any more territory, he had been taking territory all over Europe and no one was stopping him. So why would it be any different in Poland?

But here's where I tell you that it was different in Poland, because that invasion was the last straw for Britain and France. So as a result of that invasion, Britain and France declared war on Germany, and that is how you get World War II.
