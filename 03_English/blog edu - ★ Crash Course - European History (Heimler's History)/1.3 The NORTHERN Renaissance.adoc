== 释义

Okay, it's time to talk about how the Renaissance 文艺复兴 spread (v.) *from* Italy -- the place of its birth -- *to* the rest of the European #continent (洲，大陆)# 欧洲大陆.  +
So if you're ready to *get* them brain cows *milked* (v.), well then, let's get to it.  +

So in the last video, we talked about the main themes 主题 of the Renaissance, which included #humanistic thinking 人文主义思想# and an emphasis on 强调 the revival 复兴 of classical literature 古典文学 from ancient Greece and Rome.  +
Now, with the help of the printing press 印刷机 -- on which more in the next video -- these ideas began to spread (v.) north of the Italian Alps 阿尔卑斯山 into the European continent.  +

In fact, by 1500, there was something like a thousand printers 打印机；印刷厂 scattered (v.) throughout 分散在 Europe, and they *were pumping (v.)用泵输送；涌出 out* 大量生产 printed material 印刷品 by _the #metric  米制的，公制的# butt 屁股 #load (工作量；发电量，电荷)#_ （非正式）一大堆，大量地, which is to say (v.) about 40,000 different titles 书目, many of which were religious 宗教的 and many of which were #reproductions 复制品# of classical #literature (文学，文学作品；（某一学科的）文献，著述)# 古典文学.  +

|“butt load” 的含义​​
|​​字面意思​​：
“butt” 在英语中有一个古义（源自拉丁语 buttis），指一种大容量的酒桶或液体容器（约等于126加仑或476升）。因此，**“a butt load” 字面意思是“一桶的量”，**但实际使用时完全脱离了具体计量，变成了一种俚语。 +

​​俚语用法​​：
在非正式语境中，*“a butt load” = ​​“极多、大量”*​​（类似中文的“海量”“成吨”），常带有夸张或调侃的语气。 +
例：I have a butt load of homework.（我有一大堆作业。） +

|​​“metric” 的作用
|​​字面结合​​：
*“metric” 指公制计量单位（如千克、升），而“butt” 是英制/古制单位。作者故意将两者混搭，形成一种​​“伪专业”的幽默效果​​，暗示数量多到需要夸张的计量单位来形容。* +
​​效果类比​​：
类似中文说“多到用火车皮拉”或“论吨输出”，既强调数量庞大，又带调侃意味。 +

|整句的幽默与重点​
|作者用“by the metric butt load” 代替枯燥的“in large quantities”，是为了生动表达： +
欧洲印刷业在1500年已非常发达（上千家印刷厂）。 +
印刷品数量惊人（约4万种不同标题，包括宗教和古典文献）。 +
​​翻译参考​​： +
“印刷厂以‘公制巨桶’的规模, 疯狂输出印刷品”——即“印出来的书多到堆成山”。

Now, as the Renaissance spread (v.) to various parts of Europe -- what's known as the Northern Renaissance 北方文艺复兴 -- the main ideas remained (v.) #intact (a.)完好无损的,保持不变#, but the emphases 侧重点 began (v.) to change.  +
Recall (v.)回想 that in Italy, some Renaissance thinkers championed (v.)拥护 #individualism 个人主义# and #secularism 世俗主义（认为社会结构和教育等, 应排除宗教的影响）#, but thinkers in the Northern Renaissance retained (v.)保留 a more _religious_ (a.) -- which is to say 换句话说,意即, #Christian  (a.n.)基督教的# -- _framework_ 框架 for thought 思考，考虑.  +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.secular
-> 来自拉丁语 saecularis,现时的，现世的，来自 saeculum,现时，现世，可能来自 PIE*se,播种， 耕种，词源同 seed,semen.-cul,-culum,工具格后缀，词源同 oracle,hibernacle.比喻用法，即相 比于神和宗教的永恒，种子只有一次生命过程，引申词义世俗的，非宗教的。
====

For example, the Northern Renaissance art was still #naturalistic 自然主义的;写实的#, but `主` a key #distinguishing 有区别的 feature 关键区别特征# of it `系` is that it was more human-centered 以人为中心.  +
And `主` *what I mean by that `系` is that* /it *considered* (v.) ordinary objects 普通物品 and people *as* #appropriate (a.)合适的，相称的# subjects 合适的主题 for art.  +

For example, Pieter Bruegel the Elder 老彼得·勃鲁盖尔 of the Dutch and Flemish Renaissance 荷兰和佛兰德斯文艺复兴 painted (v.) this scene 场景, which you would never see in the Italian Renaissance.  +
It's called Netherlandish #Proverbs (谚语；格言)#《尼德兰箴言》, and it #depicts (v.)描绘# peasants 农民 and animals who are the subject 主题，话题 of, you know, Netherlandish proverbs 尼德兰谚语.  +

[.my1]
.title
====
.Netherlandish Proverbs
`主` Running themes 贯穿始终的主题 in Bruegel's paintings that appear (v.) in _Netherlandish (a.)荷兰的，荷兰人的 Proverbs_ `系` are _the absurdity (n.)荒谬，荒唐；荒谬的言行, wickedness and foolishness_ of humans. Its original title 原始标题, The Blue Cloak or The Folly (n.)愚蠢；荒唐事；讽刺剧 of the World, *indicates (v.)表明，标示；象征，暗示 that* `主` Bruegel's intent `系` was *not just* to illustrate (v.) proverbs, *but rather* to catalogue (v.)列入目录，编入目录；列举，记载 human folly. `主` Many of the people 后定 depicted (v.)描述，描绘 `谓` show (v.) _the characteristic 独特的，典型的 blank features_ that Bruegel used (v.) to portray (v.) fools 傻瓜.

勃鲁盖尔在 《尼德兰谚语》 中描绘的画作，其主题始终是人类的荒谬、邪恶和愚蠢。这幅画的原名是 《蓝色斗篷》或《世界的愚蠢》 ，表明勃鲁盖尔的意图并非仅仅阐释谚语，而是要记录人类的愚蠢。画中许多人物的表情, 都带着勃鲁盖尔描绘傻瓜时特有的空洞。

And the thing to notice here is that /Bruegel depicts (v.) *not* merely ordinary subjects *but* those on the bottom of the social ladder 社会底层 -- namely 即, peasants. And you can see the naturalism  自然主义 is still there.  +
These people look (v.) real, and their #setting (n.)（某事发生的）环境，场合,场景# *feels like* one you could walk around in.  +

Or consider (v.) one of the greatest artists of the Dutch Renaissance, Rembrandt 伦勃朗.  +
Here's his painting called _Slaughtered Ox_ 《宰杀的牛》, and you know, there's no #symbolism 象征意义# here. I mean, it's a painting of a slaughtered ox. This is *in no way* 决不,无论怎样也不 an elitist theme 精英主义主题 that you'd see in the Italian Renaissance *but rather* 而是 a scene from ordinary life 日常生活场景.  +

[.my2]
这绝不是你在意大利文艺复兴时期看到的精英主义主题，而是一个普通生活的场景。

Now, *that's not to say that* Northern Renaissance painters didn't #take up 选取,开始从事（某项活动）# religious themes as well.  They absolutely did.  +
`主` One of Rembrandt's most famous paintings `系` is his depiction 描述，描绘 of _The Return of the #Prodigal (a.)挥霍的；十分慷慨的# Son_ 《浪子回头》, which is a #parable （尤指《圣经》中的）寓言故事# spoken by Jesus 耶稣（上帝之子） in the New ##Testament (证明，证据；遗嘱，遗言；（人与上帝间的）圣约)## 新约圣经.  +

[.my1]

.The Return of the Prodigal Son
image:/img/The Return of the Prodigal Son.jpg[,15%]

.prodigal
-> 来自prod-,向前，来自 pro-的扩大形式，-ig,做，驱使，驱动，词源同 agent,navigate.比喻用法，被诱惑所驱动的，乱花钱的，挥霍的。

.parable
-> 来自希腊语parabole,比较，对话，类比，来自 **para-,在旁，在周围，-bole,扔，投掷，词源同 ballet,**ballistic.**即扔在旁边的，引申词义打比方，讲寓言故事。**拼写受-able影响俗化。 +
这里的“比喻”义是由“比较”义引申而来；前缀 para-指“旁边”；词根-ble-指“扔，投”，如problem（问题）；字面义“扔到旁边，而放在一块”形成一种比较。这种引申挺抽象的，再如symbol（象征，sym-“共同”，bol=ble"扔"）也由“扔在一块”引申而来。

.testament
(n.)
1.[ Cusually sing.U] *~ (to sth)* : a thing *that shows that sth else exists (v.) or is true* 证据；证明 +
SYN testimony +
•The new model is _a testament_ to the skill and dedication of the workforce. 这种新型产品显示了全体员工的技术水平和敬业精神。 +

2.[ C]= will (n.) (3) +
•This is _the last will and testament_ of... 这是…的临终遗嘱 +

Bruegel's painting _The #Procession (人或车辆的）行列，队伍# to #Calvary_ (骷髅地（耶稣被钉上十字架的地方）；基督于十字架上之受难像)# 《前往各各他的行列》 depicts (v.) Christ *carrying* his cross *to* the place of his execution 处决.  +
So the point is, yeah, the Northern Renaissance artist also depicted (v.) biblical scenes 圣经场景 like the Italian Renaissance artist, but there was much more emphasis on the ordinary people in their depictions 描绘.  +

[.my1]

(N.) the place just outside the walls of Jerusalem where Jesus was crucified (v.把……钉死在十字架上；狠批) 骷髅地; 在圣城之墙外，耶稣被钉死在十字架上的地方 (Also called Golgotha)

image:/img/Calvary.jpg[,15%]



====

Now, as humanism 人文主义 spread (v.) north from Italy, it also changed emphasis.  +
In the Northern Renaissance, there was still a #preoccupation 使人全神贯注的事物，使人入神的事物；全神贯注，入神# with Greek and Roman classics 古希腊罗马经典, but once humanism reached (v.) the Low Countries 低地国家, France, Germany, and England, people *took (v.) pains* (疼痛；千辛万苦；悲叹) 兢兢业业地做某事；费力地做某事 *to #synthesize#* #(v.)融合,（通过化学手段或生物过程）合成# humanistic thought 人文主义思想 *with* Christian tradition 基督教传统 as well.  +

[.my1]
.title

.pains
n.[临床]疼痛；千辛万苦；悲叹（pain 的复数形式） +
v.使痛苦（pain 的第三人称单数形式） +

.**TAKE (GREAT) PAINS (TO DO STH)** | GO TO GREAT PAINS (TO DO STH)
to put a lot of effort into doing sth 兢兢业业地做某事；费力地做某事 +
•The couple *went to great pains* to keep their plans secret. 这对夫妇煞费苦心，对计划守口如瓶。 +

.*BE AT PAINS (n.) TO DO STH*
to put a lot of effort into doing sth correctly 下苦功；花大力气 +
•She was *at great pains* to stress the advantages of the new system. 她极力强调新制度的优点。 +
====

This meant that *in addition to* 除了 seeking out 寻找 Greek and Roman classics, Northern Renaissance thinkers also *sought (v.) out* 寻找并找到 early Christian writings 早期基督教著作 as well, especially from folks 人名 like Saint Augustine 圣奥古斯丁 and Jerome 哲罗姆.  +
And `主` what they discovered in those ancient writings `系` was a #Christianity  基督教# that seemed far simpler and more pure 纯粹的 than the complex church hierarchy 教会等级制度 of their own day.  +

And so they sought (v.) *to return to* that simplicity. And if you want to put a term on this 用一个术语来形容 -- and I know that you do -- `主` the blending of 融合 Christianity and humanism `谓` *became known as* 被称为 Christian humanism 基督教人文主义, which, you know, it's a good name.  +

Now, #astute 敏锐的；狡猾的，诡计多端的# students will immediately grow (v.) a _question mark_ 问号 over their head. Doesn't humanism *teach (v.) that* human beings had unlimited potential 无限潜力, and *isn't that* not what Christianity teaches 难道这不正是基督教所"不教导"的吗? Well done, my dear people, you are correct.  +

[.my2]
人文主义不是教导人们"人类有无限的潜力"吗，而这不是与基督教的教义不同吗？

[.my1]
.title
====
.astute
-> 可能来自希腊语asty, 城市，来自词根 st, 站立。词源同asteism, 城里人的，故作绅士派头的。 adj. 机敏的；狡猾的，诡计多端的

.Isn’t that not what Christianity teaches?
这句话的字面意思是：​​“难道这不正是基督教所不教导的吗？”​​（即“基督教不正是反对这种观点的吗？”）。

双重否定（not + not）的作用​​： +
英语中，双重否定有时会加强语气，相当于一个肯定的反问。 +
"*Isn’t that not*..." ≈ "*Isn’t it true* that Christianity does NOT teach (v.) this?" +
→ ​​“基督教难道不正是（与此相反）吗？”​ +
====

So `主` the way Christian humanism worked out 解决、计算出 `系` was *to teach (v.) that* human beings were actually far more capable 有能力的 than previously believed, and if we could just get _a #healthy 明智的，合理的；运作良好的# dose of_ 适量的 religious enthusiasm 宗教热情 into them, then that would *lead to* efforts to reform (v.) society 改革社会 from a Christian #posture （坐或立的）姿势；态度，立场#.  +

So that's _the key thing_ to remember: Christian humanism *led to* an impulse 冲动；脉冲；推动力 for reform 改革冲动 in the Northern Renaissance. Now, there is a Christian humanist 基督教人文主义者 you have to know by name, so let me introduce you to my boy Erasmus 伊拉斯谟.  +

His book _In Praise （尤指公开地）赞美，表扬 of ##Folly##_ #(n.愚蠢；荒唐事；讽刺剧)# 《愚人颂》 was a #satire 讽刺作品# which sought (v.) to undermine (v.)削弱 political and social institutions 政治和社会制度 and which criticized (v.) the corrupt aspects 腐败方面 of religious hierarchy.  +
That shouldn't surprise (v.) you, since Christian humanists were trying to recover (v.)恢复 an ancient or simpler version of Christianity.  +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.satire
-> 该词直接借自怯语satire，但却是源于拉丁语satura。古罗马人用该拉丁词指杂烩，尤指用来祭神的“什锦水果色拉”。后来由于satura 一度被误认为和希腊神话里的森林之神Satyr有关系，词形就逐渐变为satira，词义也发生了演变，开始用以喻指“（汇集各种题材的作品于一卷的）诗文杂集”( miscellany)，再往后又转指“（鞭鞑愚昧和恶习的）讽刺杂咏”，16世纪satire在英语出现时，就用于此义，但现多用班表示“讽刺”或“讽刺作品”。
====

Additionally 此外, Erasmus *believed that* `主` education in the classics and the Bible `系` was the first step in lasting (a.) societal reform 持久的社会改革 and that such renewals 革新 should *be based (v.) not on* secular (a.)非宗教的，世俗的；现实世界的 principles 世俗原则 *but on* what he called the "philosophy of Christ" 基督哲学, which emphasized (v.) individual morality 个人道德 and #spirituality 灵性；精神性#.  +

.spirituality
(n.) [ U]the quality of being concerned with religion or the human spirit 精神性；灵性

== 中文释义

好的，是时候谈谈文艺复兴是如何从它的诞生地意大利, 传播到欧洲大陆其他地区的了。所以，如果你准备好让自己的大脑运转起来，那么，我们开始吧。 +

在上一个视频中，我们谈到了**文艺复兴**的主要主题，包括人文主义思想, 以及对古希腊和古罗马经典文学复兴的强调。现在，*在印刷术的帮助下*——关于印刷术我们会在下一个视频中详细介绍——*这些思想开始从意大利阿尔卑斯山, 向北传播到欧洲大陆。* +

事实上，到1500年，大约有一千名印刷工分散在欧洲各地，他们大量地印刷各种材料，也就是说大约有4万种不同的书籍，其中许多是宗教书籍，还有许多是古典文学的复制品。 +

现在，**当文艺复兴传播到欧洲各地——也就是所谓的"北方文艺复兴"——其文艺复兴中的主要思想依然存在，但重点开始发生变化。**回想一下，*#在意大利，一些文艺复兴时期的思想家, 倡导个人主义和世俗主义，但"北方文艺复兴"时期的思想家, 保留了一个更具宗教性——也就是说，基督教的——思想框架。#* +

例如，**#"北方文艺复兴"时期的艺术,# 仍然具有"自然主义"风格，但它的一个关键区别特征是: #更加"以人为本"。#**我的意思是，*它将普通的物体和人, 视为合适的艺术题材。* +

比如，荷兰和佛兰德斯"文艺复兴"时期的老彼得·勃鲁盖尔（Pieter Bruegel the Elder）, 绘制了这样一幅画，这是在"意大利文艺复兴时期"永远看不到的场景。这幅画叫《尼德兰箴言》（Netherlandish Proverbs），**它描绘了农民和动物，**而这些都是尼德兰箴言的主题。 +

**这里需要注意的是，勃鲁盖尔描绘的, 不仅仅是普通的题材，而是社会底层的人物——也就是农民。而且你可以看到自然主义风格依然存在。**这些人看起来很真实，他们所处的场景让人感觉可以走进去。 +

或者想想荷兰文艺复兴时期, 最伟大的艺术家之一伦勃朗（Rembrandt）。这是他的画作《宰杀的公牛》（Slaughtered Ox），你知道，*这幅画没有什么象征意义。我的意思是，这只是一幅宰杀公牛的画。这绝不是在"意大利文艺复兴时期"能看到的那种"精英主义"主题，而是普通生活中的一个场景。* +

**当然，这并不是说"北方文艺复兴时期"的画家, 不描绘宗教主题。他们当然会描绘。**伦勃朗最著名的画作之一是他对《浪子回头》（The Return of the Prodigal Son）的描绘，这是新约中耶稣讲的一个寓言故事。 +

勃鲁盖尔的画作《前往髑髅地的行列》（The Procession to Calvary）, 描绘了基督背着十字架走向被处决之地的场景。所以重点是，*是的，#北方文艺复兴时期的艺术家也像意大利文艺复兴时期的艺术家一样描绘圣经场景，但在他们的描绘中更加注重普通人。#* +

*现在，当人文主义从意大利向北传播时，它的重点也发生了变化。在"北方文艺复兴"时期，人们仍然关注希腊和罗马经典著作，#但一旦"人文主义"传播到低地国家、法国、德国和英国，人们就努力将人文主义思想, 与基督教传统结合起来。#* +

**这意味着，除了寻找希腊和罗马经典著作外，"北方文艺复兴"时期的思想家, 也寻找早期基督教的著作，**尤其是像圣奥古斯丁（Saint Augustine）和哲罗姆（Jerome）等人的著作。*他们在这些古代著作中发现的基督教，比他们那个时代复杂的教会等级制度, 要简单纯粹得多。* +

**所以他们试图回归那种简单。**如果你想给**这种现象**起个名字——我知道你想——*基督教人文主义*（Christian humanism），这个名字很合适。 +

现在，聪明的学生马上会在脑海中产生一个疑问。**#人文主义不是教导人们"人类有无限的潜力"吗，而这不是与基督教的教义不同吗？#**干得好，亲爱的朋友们，你们说得对。 +

*#所以"基督教人文主义"的观点是，人类实际上比以前认为的更有能力，如果我们能让人们充满宗教热情，那么这将促使人们以基督教的姿态, 去改革社会。#* +

**#所以关键要记住："基督教人文主义"在北方文艺复兴时期, 引发了"改革"的冲动。#**现在，有一位基督教人文主义者你必须知道他的名字，让我给你介绍一下我的朋友伊拉斯谟（Erasmus）。 +

他的书《愚人颂》（In Praise of Folly）是一部讽刺作品，旨在削弱政治和社会制度，并批评"宗教等级制度"的腐败方面。这并不奇怪，因为**"基督教人文主义者"试图恢复古代更简单版本的基督教。** +

此外，*伊拉斯谟认为，对经典著作和《圣经》的教育, 是实现"持久社会改革"的第一步，而且这种复兴, 不应该基于世俗原则，而应该基于他所说的 “基督的哲学”，这种哲学强调个人道德和精神性。* +

Okay, it's time to talk about how the Renaissance spread from Italy -- the place of its birth -- to the rest of the European continent. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then, let's get to it.

So in the last video, we talked about the main themes of the Renaissance, which included humanistic thinking and an emphasis on the revival of classical literature from ancient Greece and Rome. Now, with the help of the printing press -- on which more in the next video -- these ideas began to spread north of the Italian Alps into the European continent.

In fact, by 1500, there was something like a thousand printers scattered throughout Europe, and they were pumping out printed material by the metric butt load, which is to say about 40,000 different titles, many of which were religious and many of which were reproductions of classical literature.

Now, as the Renaissance spread to various parts of Europe -- what's known as the Northern Renaissance -- the main ideas remained intact, but the emphases began to change. Recall that in Italy, some Renaissance thinkers championed individualism and secularism, but thinkers in the Northern Renaissance retained a more religious -- which is to say, Christian -- framework for thought.

For example, the Northern Renaissance art was still naturalistic, but a key distinguishing feature of it is that it was more human-centered. And what I mean by that is that it considered ordinary objects and people as appropriate subjects for art.

For example, Pieter Bruegel the Elder of the Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painted this scene, which you would never see in the Italian Renaissance. It's called *Netherlandish Proverbs*, and it depicts peasants and animals who are the subject of, you know, Netherlandish proverbs.

And the thing to notice here is that Bruegel depicts not merely ordinary subjects but those on the bottom of the social ladder -- namely, peasants. And you can see the naturalism is still there. These people look real, and their setting feels like one you could walk around in.

Or consider one of the greatest artists of the Dutch Renaissance, Rembrandt. Here's his painting called *Slaughtered Ox*, and you know, there's no symbolism here. I mean, it's a painting of a slaughtered ox. This is in no way an elitist theme that you'd see in the Italian Renaissance but rather a scene from ordinary life.

Now, that's not to say that Northern Renaissance painters didn't take up religious themes as well. They absolutely did. One of Rembrandt's most famous paintings is his depiction of *The Return of the Prodigal Son*, which is a parable spoken by Jesus in the New Testament.

Bruegel's painting *The Procession to Calvary* depicts Christ carrying his cross to the place of his execution. So the point is, yeah, the Northern Renaissance artist also depicted biblical scenes like the Italian Renaissance artist, but there was much more emphasis on the ordinary people in their depictions.

Now, as humanism spread north from Italy, it also changed emphasis. In the Northern Renaissance, there was still a preoccupation with Greek and Roman classics, but once humanism reached the Low Countries, France, Germany, and England, people took pains to synthesize humanistic thought with Christian tradition as well.

This meant that in addition to seeking out Greek and Roman classics, Northern Renaissance thinkers also sought out early Christian writings as well, especially from folks like Saint Augustine and Jerome. And what they discovered in those ancient writings was a Christianity that seemed far simpler and more pure than the complex church hierarchy of their own day.

And so they sought to return to that simplicity. And if you want to put a term on this -- and I know that you do -- the blending of Christianity and humanism became known as Christian humanism, which, you know, it's a good name.

Now, astute students will immediately grow a question mark over their head. Doesn't humanism teach that human beings had unlimited potential, and isn't that not what Christianity teaches? Well done, my dear people, you are correct.

So the way Christian humanism worked out was to teach that human beings were actually far more capable than previously believed, and if we could just get a healthy dose of religious enthusiasm into them, then that would lead to efforts to reform society from a Christian posture.

So that's the key thing to remember: Christian humanism led to an impulse for reform in the Northern Renaissance. Now, there is a Christian humanist you have to know by name, so let me introduce you to my boy Erasmus.

His book *In Praise of Folly* was a satire which sought to undermine political and social institutions and which criticized the corrupt aspects of religious hierarchy. That shouldn't surprise you, since Christian humanists were trying to recover an ancient or simpler version of Christianity.

Additionally, Erasmus believed that education in the classics and the Bible was the first step in lasting societal reform and that such renewals should be based not on secular principles but on what he called the "philosophy of Christ," which emphasized individual morality and spirituality.
