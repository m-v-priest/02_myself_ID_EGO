== 释义

Okay, so World War One was fought, at least by American President Woodrow Wilson's reckoning 估计；估算, to make the world safe for democracy. But that didn't really work out 解决，成功，顺利进行 too well /because in the years between the two World Wars, totalitarian 极权主义的 governments sprang up 涌现；出现 dang (ad.)该死地；十足地（等于damn） near 几乎；将近 everywhere in Europe. And so we need to figure out 弄清楚，弄明白 why that is. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a healthy dose of right and left-wing extremism 极端主义, let's get to it. +

So `主` Woodrow Wilson's desire (n.)  for democracy to flourish (v.)繁荣；兴盛 after World War One `系` was not going to be a thing 成为现实,实现. Instead, `主` what we see /in several places across Europe `系` is the rise of fascist 法西斯主义的 states. And let me define that /before going on.  +
For a definition, let's consult 查阅；咨询 the man /who was most associated with the term, namely the Italian fascist Benito Mussolini. `主` His chosen (a.) symbol for fascism `系` was a bundle of sticks 棍；树枝 and an axe. `主` What that represented `系` was a group of people bound to the authority of a single powerful leader. So ultimately, fascism 法西斯主义 is a political philosophy 哲学；哲学体系，思想体系 /that emphasizes (v.) obedience 服从；顺从 to an authoritarian 独裁的；专制的 leader /and which leverages (v.)利用 all the resources of the state /to fulfill (v.)the leader's ambition. +

这里的 ​​"going to be a thing"​​ 是一个英语口语表达，意思是 ​​“成为现实/实现”​​ 或 ​​“持续存在/流行”​​。

伍德罗·威尔逊希望一战结束后民主能够繁荣发展，但这并没有成为现实（或‘未能实现’）。

- "Are self-driving cars going to be a thing in the future?"（自动驾驶汽车未来会普及吗？）

2.
​​#*"not going to be a thing"​​ 则表示 ​​“不会发生/不会成功/不会成为现实”​​。*#

Now `主` we here in the 21st century `谓` are trained to think of fascism as a bad thing, and just to be clear, I agree -- like nobody wants to live (v.) under the rule of an authoritarian (a.)独裁主义的；权力主义的 turd 粪便；可鄙的人. But to Europeans in the inter-war years, fascism was an attractive option, and we need to understand why.  +
The first reason was the proliferation （数量的）激增，剧增;扩散；蔓延 of World War One bitterness 怨恨；痛苦. Many European societies *were deeply divided* along class lines (在阶级层面上)许多欧洲社会都因阶级界线,而严重分裂 in the post-war years /because of the immense 巨大的；极大的 need for wartime production. The working class *grew in power* /during the war /while _middle class power and influence_ declined /because of the suffering of _consumer industry_ 消费行业. +

[.my2]
第一个原因是, 第一次世界大战遗留下来的怨恨情绪的蔓延。在战后时期，许多欧洲社会因战时生产的需求, 而沿着阶级界限产生了严重的分裂。战争期间, 工人阶级的势力增强，而中产阶级的权力和影响力, 则因消费品行业的遭受重创而下降。

[.my1]

在两次世界大战之间的欧洲，第一次世界大战对社会经济结构产生了深远影响，尤其体现在阶级力量的此消彼长上。

第一次世界大战对工人阶级力量的增强, 主要源于以下几个方面：

- 战争对劳动力的巨大需求：**战争期间，军事工业和重工业对工人的需求急剧增加。**工厂需要生产武器、弹药、军服和其他军需品。这种巨大的需求**使得工人成为了不可或缺的生产力。**

- *工会力量的增长：由于工人变得稀缺和重要，他们的议价能力显著提高。工会利用这一优势为工人争取更高的工资、更好的工作条件和更强的政治话语权。各国政府和企业为了维持生产稳定，也更愿意与工会合作。*

- 战后，工人阶级政党（如英国工党、德国社民党）在政治上的话语权扩大，甚至参与执政。

相比之下，中产阶级的力量和影响力则有所减弱：

- 消费品产业的萎缩：*战争时期，经济重心, 从消费品生产（如服装、家具、娱乐等）转向军工生产。这使得依赖这些产业的中产阶级企业家、店主和专业人士的经济基础, 受到严重冲击。*

- *通货膨胀的影响：战争和战后普遍出现的通货膨胀, 侵蚀了中产阶级的储蓄和固定收入。与能够通过工会争取更高工资的工人不同，中产阶级的收入增长往往跟不上物价上涨的速度，导致他们的经济状况恶化。*

阶级矛盾激化为法西斯主义铺路​​

- ​​中产阶级的“被剥夺感”​​：
战后经济危机（如1929年大萧条）进一步挤压**中产阶级，他们将不满指向两方面：** +
•
​​上层​​：*谴责金融资本家和“国际犹太财阀”*（反犹主义的温床）； +
•
​​下层​​：*恐惧工人阶级革命*（如俄国十月革命后欧洲多国爆发罢工），*认为工会和左翼政党“威胁私有财产和社会秩序”。* +
(#*也就是说, 中产阶级要走中间路线, 严格警惕"极左"(工人运动)和"极右"(财阀寡头)*. 这是对的.#)

- ​​法西斯主义的“阶级调和”言论​​： +
*法西斯政党*（如意大利墨索里尼、德国纳粹）利用中产阶级的恐慌，*宣称要​​“超越阶级斗争”​​，承诺打击大资本、镇压工人运动、恢复“稳定的社会等级”。这种口号对绝望的中产阶级极具吸引力。*

There was also bitterness 苦味；苦难；怨恨 among gender lines 性别界限 as well. Many women had gone to work /while their men were off fighting, and many of them cherished 珍视；珍爱 their newfound (a.)新发现的；新得到的 sense of importance 重要性意识 to working society. But for the most part, when the men returned, women were expected to go back home /and live their days making their husbands sandwiches, and that _to many women_ was _no bueno_  (好) (西班牙语直译)不好（=not good）. +


[.my2]
​​性别之间的对立情绪同样存在。许多女性在男性外出作战时投身工作，并珍视这种 newfound（新获得的）对社会的重要性。但多数情况下，当男性归来后，女性被迫回归家庭，终日为丈夫做三明治——对许多女性来说，这简直“no bueno”（糟糕透顶）。​​

[.my1]
.title

.sense of importance
重要性意识：指一个人对事物、观点或行为的重要性的认识和感知。 +
Newfound sense of importance​​：
“新获得的重要性”，指女性通过参与社会生产实现自我价值，体会到独立和经济自主的意义。

The second reason people were open to fascist states `系` was the rise of communism 共产主义，共产主义理论（或制度）. Many folks in Europe feared (v.) communism, especially in Russia, represented a fearful situation /should it come to dominate (v.) other states in Europe. And just hold on to 紧紧抓住或保持某物，不放手或不失去它 that /for a second 先拿着它一会儿 -- we'll talk about it more later. +

The third reason people were open to fascist states `系`  was economic instability 不稳定. Recall (v.)回想；回忆起 in the last video /we talked about the devastating 毁灭性的 economic effects of the Great Depression. Huge percentages 很大比例的 of the population were *out of work* 失业, and inflation 通货膨胀 was out of control. There seemed to be *no way out of it* 似乎没有出路了. *It's hard to overestimate* (高估；过分估计)无论如何高估都不为过 the insecurity  不安全，无把握 后定说明 such a condition caused (v.) among the average European.  +
So when strong fascist leaders styled (v.)把…设计（或缝制、做）成某种式样 themselves as saviors 救世主 from these conditions /and put the blame 归咎于 for those conditions in all the right places /and tapped into 利用；挖掘 a powerful sense 强烈的情绪 of victimization 受害；牺牲；欺骗 that people felt, for many people /`主` that `谓` seemed like a no-brainer 无需动脑筋的事；容易作的决定. +

[.my2]
这种情况给普通欧洲人带来的不安全感, 怎么估计都不为过。因此，当强大的法西斯领导人把自己塑造成救世主的形象，把责任推到所有"正确"的地方，并利用"人们感受到的"强烈的受害感"时，对许多人来说，这似乎是不需要思考的。

[.my1]
.title
====
.put the blame in all the right places
是一个带有 ​​反讽（irony）​​ 意味的表达.

- 字面意思​​：
“把责任归咎于‘正确的地方’”（仿佛法西斯领袖明察秋毫，精准定位了问题根源）。
- ​​实际含义​​（反讽）：
法西斯分子 ​​将经济危机归咎于“替罪羊”群体​​（如犹太人、共产主义者、少数族裔等）。所谓“right places”其实是 ​​“符合民众偏见的目标”​​，但非真正的原因。 +
法西斯提供的“答案”简单直接（如“犹太银行家操控经济”“共产党人破坏稳定”），​​恰好迎合了大众已有的仇恨或恐惧​​。

Okay, so let's start with the birthplace 出生地,发源地 of fascism proper 确切地说 and consider Mussolini's Italy. So `主` all the social difficulties I just mentioned `系` were present in Italy in the 1920s -- like high unemployment, severe _war debt_, etc. -- and the Italian government was not able to effectively *deal with* these problems. So Benito Mussolini, who started his career as a left-wing socialist, *changed* his position *to* _extreme right-wing fascism_ /because he saw that by championing 拥护；支持 those ideals he and his followers could gain power in Italy. He spoke ardently 热情地；热烈地 against communism, at least all of his language with a healthy dose of Italian nationalism. +

So by 1922, after threatening to march on Rome with his army of fascists, the king of Italy made Mussolini the prime minister of Italy. Now only a few years later, the Italian parliament granted 授予；准予 Mussolini dictatorial 独裁的；专政的 powers for a year, which as you can probably guess, he never gave up. So now Mussolini is in total control of Italy and worked quickly to establish a totalitarian fascist state. And how did he do it? Well first, he used modern technology and propaganda 宣传 to spread his message to all Italians. These messages glorified 赞美；颂扬 war, exposed the dangers of democracy and communism, and most of all demonstrated how fascism was the answer to the political and economic instability of the post-war world. For anyone who was disillusioned 幻想破灭的；失望的 by the state of post-war Europe, especially for those countries who had lost the war, these appeals 呼吁；恳请 made a whole lot of sense. +

A second, Mussolini made use of a secret police which in Italy was known as the Blackshirts. For Mussolini, violence was key to squashing 镇压；压制 any dissent 异议；反对 to his message and plan. Many of the members of the secret police were students and war veterans who were eager to use violence in an unrestricted 无限制的；不受约束的 way. And one of their favorite ways to keep people in line 使遵守秩序 was by giving dissenters horse doses of castor oil. If you don't know what that is, it's basically a naturally occurring diuretic 利尿剂 which in small doses, you know, gets things moving down. But the secret police would pour whole bottles of this stuff into people's mouths, and that would have them suffering from violent diarrhea 腹泻 for days, which was not only inconvenient but could often lead to death through dehydration 脱水. So you know, that's fun. +

But despite Mussolini's tactics 策略；手段, Italy never fully came entirely under his control. The Italian monarchy 君主制；君主政体 and the armed forces retained 保留；保持 some degree of independence. But if you want an example of a fascist state which gained entire control over the state -- and I know that you do -- then let's go visit Germany during the interwar years. +

The next fascist state to emerge was in Germany under the leadership of supreme historical turd Adolf Hitler. And again, after World War One, Germany maybe more than any other European nation suffered terror because they received the most severe punishments from the Treaty of Versailles. Their economy went down the toilet, and they were humiliated 羞辱；使丢脸 on the international stage. And because the Weimar government could not address 处理；解决 these problems, many German people were ripe for 对……来说时机成熟 the extremist 极端主义的 policies of Adolf Hitler. +

Now early in his life, Hitler developed deeply rooted 根深蒂固的 racialist 种族主义的 ideas, most notably a virulent 恶毒的；恶意的 anti-Semitism 反犹主义, which is to say a hatred of the Jews. By the 1920s, Hitler had gained control of the National Socialist German Workers Party, which for short was known as the Nazi Party 纳粹党. Throughout the beginning of the '20s, the Nazis gained more and more power in Germany, and by the beginning of the 1930s, Hitler, like Mussolini, convinced the parliament to grant him emergency dictatorial powers, and like Mussolini, he never gave them up. +

So with Hitler in power, he used many of the same tactics as Mussolini to stay in power but was much more effective in his use of those tactics. Hitler used the radio, video, and television to broadcast his speeches, which were positively overflowing with 充满 nationalist messages, anti-Semitic claims, and plans to restore the glory of Germany. In fact, Hitler had his own propaganda minister named Joseph Goebbels -- that Goebbels -- who harnessed 利用 the power of film to get Hitler in front of the eyes of Germans across the country. Filming Hitler's powerful speeches and his adoring 崇拜的；敬慕的 fans lined up to greet him in downtown parades had a way of making Hitler's appeal seem universal. +

Now Hitler also made use of a secret police known as the Schutzstaffel, or SS for short. The SS introduced no small amount of terror to anyone who opposed Hitler in his policies, and all of it was organized by a guy named Heinrich Himmler. And I pray to the good Lord in heaven that I am not somehow related to this guy because he was the worst. Himmler was the architect 设计师；缔造者 of murder and oppression 压迫；压制, the organizer of concentration camps 集中营, and the main proponent 支持者；拥护者 of purifying 净化；提纯 the races of Germany. So I'm not even going to look for a family connection there -- like I think I'd rather not know. +

Now while all this is going on in Italy and Germany, similar episodes were occurring in Spain. Because of the economic and political turmoil 动荡；混乱 in the years right after the war, Spain went into a tailspin 迅速下降；混乱. There the Great Depression ultimately led to the lapse 失效；终止 of parliamentary democracy 议会民主制, and that is when competing factions 派别；派系 began fighting for dominance 统治；控制. By 1936, a group of leftists called the Popular Front 人民阵线 took control, and their group represented the interest of workers and communists. +

Now the one group who vehemently 激烈地；强烈地 opposed this new government was the Spanish Army, led by General Francisco Franco. He led a violent uprising 起义；暴动 against the Popular Front and installed himself as the head of state, and this forcible 强制的；强迫的 seizure of power 夺取政权 led directly to the Spanish Civil War between Franco and the Popular Front. Now the reason the Civil War is relevant to what we're talking about here is not just that Franco was another fascist-like dictator, but the Spanish Civil War represented a kind of testing ground 试验场 for World War II. And here's what I mean: because fascist dictators love to see other fascist dictators come to power, Franco gained the support for his cause from both Hitler and Mussolini. +

"Franco, let me ask you something: how do you feel about explosive diarrhea?"
"I love it."
"All right, I'm in. I'm in." +

However, the Popular Front didn't receive nearly as much support from the Western democracies of Europe, and ultimately Franco won that war and ruled Spain without rival 对手；竞争者. And I said this war was a testing ground for World War II, and that's because Hitler and Mussolini observed with great relish 愉快；高兴 that when fascism asserted itself 显示自身的力量 in Europe, Western democracies did almost nothing to oppose it. And that will be a useful bit of information that they will put right in their pockets and come back to in the second half of the 1930s. +

But totalitarian governments are not only being installed in Western Europe. Eastern Europe jumped in on the fascist party too. Recall that several new states were created in the East after World War One, and they were established as parliamentary democracies. But those democracies suffered first of all with all the same economic problems plaguing 困扰；折磨 the rest of the continent, and second of all because democracy was a very new thing to them, and it is difficult to establish such a system in the midst of a deep economic slump 衰退；不景气. You just want someone to come in and solve all your problems, and that is how fascist and authoritarian governments were installed in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and other states as well. +

And speaking of authoritarian governments, let's check in with Russia, now officially known as the Soviet Union. Last time we visited, the Russian Revolution was freshly over, and Lenin had turned Russia into a communist state. It's important to know here that while right-wing fascists despise 鄙视；厌恶 communism, the Communist Soviet Union was very similar in a lot of ways, which is to say authoritarianism 专制主义；独裁主义 is just as likely on the left wing as it is on the right. Anyway, after Lenin died, Joseph Stalin rose to power in his place. And I know that I said that Himmler was the worst, but this guy is also the worst -- like there's just so many worst in this video. +

Stalin was responsible for sending over a million political dissidents 持不同政见者 to forced labor camps called gulags 古拉格集中营, and he had no qualms 疑虑；不安 about allowing torture 酷刑；折磨 to gain false confessions 虚假供词 out of his enemies. Anyway, after consolidating 巩固；加强 party power under himself, Stalin implemented 实施；执行 a Five-Year Plan 五年计划, and the goal of this was to rapidly modernize -- which is to say industrialize 工业化 -- the Soviet Union. The truth is the growth of Soviet industrialization during this period was staggering 令人震惊的；难以想象的. You know, that's a good thing, right? Not so much. The consequences of that Five-Year Plan were devastating to the Russian people. Millions of workers flooded into these new industrial centers, and because Stalin wasn't much interested in providing decent housing for them, they lived in squalid 肮脏的；污秽的 conditions. But don't worry, their wages were rapidly decreasing as well. And why? Well, because Stalin told them through an elaborate 详尽的；精心策划的 propaganda campaign they were working for the progress of the socialist utopia 乌托邦；理想国 promised them in the revolution. +

Not only that, but after the first Five-Year Plan failed, criticism against Stalin reached a fever pitch 高度紧张；狂热状态, and many in the Communist Party called for his removal, not least of which was the luminary 杰出人物；名人 of Lenin's regime, Leon Trotsky. In response, Stalin authorized 批准；授权 the Great Purge 大清洗, which was a systematic 系统的；有条理的 removal of all Stalin's enemies from the state, which eventually filtered down to some Russian citizens as well. The Purge was carried out by Stalin's secret police, who imprisoned, tortured, and executed those who disagreed with Stalin. +

== 中文释义

好的，第一次世界大战（World War One）的爆发，至少在美国总统伍德罗·威尔逊（Woodrow Wilson）看来，是为了使世界对民主安全。但这并没有真正奏效，因为**在两次世界大战之间的几年里，"极权主义"政府几乎在欧洲各地涌现。**因此，我们需要弄清楚这是为什么。如果你准备好用大量的"左右翼极端主义"来挤压你大脑里的奶牛，让我们开始吧。 +

因此，伍德罗·威尔逊（Woodrow Wilson）希望在第一次世界大战后"民主蓬勃发展"的愿望, 并没有实现。相反，我们在欧洲的几个地方看到的是**法西斯国家的崛起。**在继续之前，让我先定义一下。关于定义，让我们咨询与这个术语最相关的人，即意大利法西斯贝尼托·墨索里尼（Benito Mussolini）。他为**"#法西斯主义#"**选择**的象征, 是一捆棍子和一把斧头。这##代表了一群人受制于一个强大的领导人的权威。##**因此，最终，法西斯主义是一种政治哲学，*它强调服从一个独裁的领导人，并利用国家的所有资源, 来实现领导人的野心(中国)。* +

现在我们 21 世纪的人们被训练成认为, 法西斯主义是一件坏事，并且明确地说，我同意——没有人愿意生活在一个独裁混蛋的统治下。但是对于两次世界大战之间的欧洲人来说，法西斯主义是一个有吸引力的选择，我们需要理解为什么。第一个原因是第一次世界大战（World War One）后遗留的痛苦情绪的蔓延。由于战时生产的巨大需求，**许多欧洲社会在战后几年里沿着阶级界限严重分裂。**战争期间工人阶级的力量壮大，而由于消费工业的衰落，中产阶级的力量和影响力下降。 +

**性别界限之间也存在痛苦。许多妇女在她们的男人去战斗时去工作，她们中的许多人珍惜她们新获得的对工作社会的归属感。但大多数情况下，当男人回来时，妇女们被期望重新回到家里，**每天为她们的丈夫做三明治，这对许多妇女来说是不可接受的。 +

**人们对"法西斯国家"持"开放态度"的第二个原因, 是共产主义的兴起。**欧洲的许多人害怕共产主义，尤其是在俄国，如果它统治欧洲其他国家，那将是一种可怕的局面。请稍等一下——我们稍后会更多地讨论它。 +

人们对法西斯国家持开放态度的**第三个原因, 是经济不稳定。**回想一下上一个视频，我们讨论了大萧条（Great Depression）带来的毁灭性经济影响。很大比例的人口失业，通货膨胀失控。似乎没有摆脱困境的方法。很难高估这种状况给普通欧洲人带来的不安全感。**因此，当强大的法西斯领导人将自己塑造成这些状况的救星，**并将这些状况的责任归咎于所有正确的地方，并利用人们感受到的强烈的"受害者意识"时，*对许多人来说，这似乎是显而易见的选择。* +

好的，让我们从法西斯主义真正的发源地开始，考虑墨索里尼（Mussolini）的意大利。**我刚才提到的所有社会困难, 在 1920 年代的意大利都存在——比如高失业率、严重的战争债务等等——而意大利政府无法有效地处理这些问题。**因此，贝尼托·墨索里尼（Benito Mussolini），他的职业生涯始于"左翼社会主义者"，将他的立场转变为"极右翼法西斯主义"，因为他看到通过拥护这些理想，他和他的追随者可以在意大利获得权力。他强烈反对共产主义，至少他的所有言论都带有强烈的意大利民族主义色彩。 +

因此，到 1922 年，在威胁要率领他的法西斯军队进军罗马之后，意大利国王任命墨索里尼（Mussolini）为意大利首相。仅仅几年后，**意大利议会授予墨索里尼（Mussolini）为期一年的独裁权力，**正如你可能猜到的，**他从未放弃过。**因此，现在墨索里尼（Mussolini）完全控制了意大利，并迅速建立了一个极权主义的法西斯国家。他是怎么做到的？首先，他利用现代技术和宣传, 将他的信息传播给所有意大利人。这些信息美化战争，揭露民主和共产主义的危险，最重要的是展示了法西斯主义是如何解决战后世界政治和经济不稳定的答案。对于任何对战后欧洲的状况感到失望的人，特别是对于那些战败的国家来说，这些呼吁非常有道理。 +

其次，墨索里尼（Mussolini）利用了一支秘密警察，在意大利被称为黑衫党（Blackshirts）。对于墨索里尼（Mussolini）来说，暴力是镇压任何对其信息和计划异议的关键。**许多秘密警察的成员, 是渴望以不受限制的方式使用暴力的学生和退伍军人。**他们最喜欢的维持秩序的方式之一就是给异议者大量蓖麻油（castor oil）。如果你不知道那是什么，它基本上是一种天然的利尿剂，小剂量服用可以促进肠道蠕动。但是秘密警察会把整瓶这种东西倒进人们的嘴里，这会导致他们几天都遭受剧烈的腹泻，这不仅不方便，而且常常会导致脱水而死亡。所以你知道，这很有趣。 +

但是尽管墨索里尼（Mussolini）采取了这些策略，**意大利从未完全在他的控制之下。意大利王室和军队保留了一定程度的独立性。**但是如果你想要**一个完全控制国家的法西斯国家的例子**——我知道你想要——那么让我们去看看两次世界大战期间的**德国**。 +

下一个出现的法西斯国家是在阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）这个历史超级混蛋领导下的德国。同样，在第一次世界大战（World War One）之后，德国可能比任何其他欧洲国家都遭受了更大的恐怖，因为他们受到了"凡尔赛条约"（Treaty of Versailles）最严厉的惩罚。他们的经济一落千丈，在国际舞台上颜面扫地。由于魏玛政府（Weimar government）无法解决这些问题，许多德国人民都容易接受阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）的极端主义政策。 +

在早年，希特勒（Hitler）形成了根深蒂固的"种族主义"思想，最显著的是一种恶毒的"反犹太主义"（anti-Semitism），也就是说对犹太人的仇恨。到 1920 年代，希特勒（Hitler）控制了国家**"社会主义德国工人党"**（National Socialist German Workers Party），*简称"纳粹党"*（Nazi Party）。在 20 年代初，纳粹党（Nazis）在德国获得了越来越大的权力，到 *1930 年代初，希特勒（Hitler）像墨索里尼（Mussolini）一样，说服议会授予他紧急独裁权力*，并且像墨索里尼（Mussolini）一样，他从未放弃这些权力。 +

因此，希特勒（Hitler）掌权后，他使用了许多与墨索里尼（Mussolini）相同的策略来维持权力，但在使用这些策略方面效率更高。希特勒（Hitler）利用广播、视频和电视播放他的演讲，这些演讲充满了民族主义信息、反犹太主义的主张, 以及恢复德国荣耀的计划。事实上，希特勒（Hitler）有他自己的**宣传部长约瑟夫·戈培尔**（Joseph Goebbels）——就是那个戈培尔——他利用电影的力量将希特勒（Hitler）展现在全国德国人的眼前。拍摄希特勒（Hitler）充满力量的演讲, 以及他狂热的粉丝在市中心游行中排队迎接他的场面，有一种使希特勒（Hitler）的吸引力看起来是普遍性的方式。 +

现在希特勒（Hitler）也利用了一支被称为**“党卫队”（Schutzstaffel），简称 SS 的秘密警察。**党卫队（SS）**对任何反对希特勒（Hitler）及其政策的人都施加了巨大的恐怖，这一切都由一个名叫海因里希·希姆莱（Heinrich Himmler）的人组织。**我向上帝祈祷，我与这个人没有任何关系，因为他太坏了。希姆莱（Himmler）是谋杀和压迫的策划者，**集中营的组织者，以及净化德国种族的主要倡导者。**所以我甚至不会去寻找家庭联系——我想我宁愿不知道。 +

**当意大利和德国发生这一切时，类似的情节也发生在西班牙。**由于战后初期的经济和政治动荡，西班牙陷入了困境。在那里，**大萧条（Great Depression）最终导致"议会民主制"的崩溃，这时相互竞争的派别开始争夺统治权。**到 1936 年，一个名为"人民阵线"（Popular Front）的左翼团体, 夺取了控制权，他们的团体代表了工人和共产主义者的利益。 +

现在，有一个团体强烈反对这个新政府，那就是由**弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥将军**（General Francisco Franco）领导的西班牙军队。他领导了一场反对人民阵线（Popular Front）的暴力起义，并**自封为国家元首，而这种强行夺取权力的行为, 直接导致了佛朗哥（Franco）和"人民阵线"（Popular Front）之间的西班牙内战**（Spanish Civil War）。现在，内战与我们在这里讨论的内容相关的原因, 不仅仅在于佛朗哥（Franco）是另一个类似法西斯的独裁者，而且西班牙内战（Spanish Civil War）代表了第二次世界大战（World War II）的一种试验场。我的意思是：因为法西斯独裁者喜欢看到其他法西斯独裁者上台，所以**佛朗哥（Franco）从希特勒（Hitler）和墨索里尼（Mussolini）那里都获得了对其事业的支持。** +

“佛朗哥（Franco），我问你一件事：你觉得'爆炸性腹泻'怎么样？”
“我喜欢。”
“好吧，我加入了。我加入了。” +

然而，**人民阵线（Popular Front）并没有得到欧洲西方民主国家的大力支持，最终佛朗哥（Franco）赢得了那场战争，并独自统治了西班牙。**我说这场战争是第二次世界大战（World War II）的试验场，那是因为**希特勒（Hitler）和墨索里尼（Mussolini）兴高采烈地观察到，当法西斯主义在欧洲抬头时，西方民主国家几乎没有采取任何行动来反对它。**这将是一个有用的信息，他们会把它放在口袋里，并在 1930 年代后半期再次利用它。 +

但是"极权主义政府"不仅仅在西欧建立起来。**东欧也加入了法西斯主义的行列。**回想一下，**第一次世界大战（World War One）后在东方建立了一些新的国家，它们被建立为"议会民主制"。但是这些民主国家, **首先**遭受了**困扰整个大陆的同样的**经济问题，其次是##因为民主对他们来说是一个非常新的事物，在严重的经济衰退时期建立这样一个制度是很困难的。你只想有人来解决你所有的问题，这就是##法西斯主义和##独裁政府##在波兰（Poland）、匈牙利（Hungary）、罗马尼亚（Romania）和其他国家##能建立起来的原因 (即, 人民会有病乱投医, 寄希望于有一个"神"(强人)来解决他们的困境)##。** +

说到独裁政府，让我们来看看俄国，现在正式称为"苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟"（Soviet Union）。上次我们访问时，俄国革命（Russian Revolution）刚刚结束，列宁（Lenin）已将俄国变成了一个共产主义国家。这里重要的是要知道，**#虽然"右翼法西斯主义者"鄙视"共产主义"，但共产主义的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（Communist Soviet Union）在很多方面都非常相似，也就是说，左翼和右翼都可能出现独裁主义。#**无论如何，在列宁（Lenin）去世后，约瑟夫·斯大林（Joseph Stalin）取代了他的位置。我知道我说过希姆莱（Himmler）是最坏的，但是这个人也是最坏的——就像这个视频里有很多最坏的人一样。 +

**斯大林（Stalin）负责将一百多万政治异见者, 送往古拉格（gulags）强制劳动营，**并且毫不犹豫地允许使用酷刑, 从他的敌人那里获得虚假的供词。无论如何，在巩固了他在党内的权力之后，*斯大林（Stalin）实施了五年计划*（Five-Year Plan），其目标是迅速实现苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（Soviet Union）的现代化——**也就是说，工业化。**事实是，在此期间, 苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（Soviet Union）的工业化增长是惊人的。你知道，这是件好事，对吧？没那么简单。五年计划（Five-Year Plan）的后果对俄罗斯人民来说是毁灭性的。**数百万工人涌入这些新的工业中心，由于斯大林（Stalin）对为他们提供像样的住房并不太感兴趣，他们生活在肮脏的环境中。**但是别担心，*##他们的工资也在迅速下降。##为什么？嗯，因为斯大林（Stalin）通过精心策划的宣传运动告诉他们，他们正在为革命中承诺的社会主义乌托邦的进步而工作(在割人民的韭菜)。* +

不仅如此，**在第一个五年计划（Five-Year Plan）失败后，对斯大林（Stalin）的批评达到了白热化的程度，共产党内的许多人呼吁罢免他，**其中最引人注目的是列宁（Lenin）政权的杰出人物列昂·托洛茨基（Leon Trotsky）。**作为回应，斯大林（Stalin）授权进行了大清洗（Great Purge），这是系统地清除国家中所有斯大林（Stalin）敌人的行动，**最终也波及了一些俄罗斯公民。清洗由斯大林（Stalin）的秘密警察执行，他们监禁、折磨和处决那些不同意斯大林（Stalin）的人。 +

到现在为止，毫无疑问，极权主义国家经常利用他们的秘密警察部队, 来压制政治异议。此外，**在列宁（Lenin）时期，出现了一个富有的地主群体，称为富农（kulaks），他们雇用农民耕种他们的土地。**然而，*斯大林（Stalin）认为，这样一个阶级的人只不过是肮脏的资本家*，在苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（Soviet Union）中没有地位。因此，**他实施了一项集体化（collectivization）计划，其中土地从这些地主手中夺走，置于国家权力控制之下。**这种情况发生在许多地方，但**后果最严重的是在乌克兰（Ukraine），**乌克兰是苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（Soviet Union）*最主要的粮食生产地。* +

**由于乌克兰的富农（Ukrainian kulaks）如此深切地憎恨斯大林（Stalin）的集体化（collectivization）计划，并努力抵抗和破坏它，斯大林（Stalin）采取了一项政策，导致仅在乌克兰地区就有大约 700 万人遭受饥饿和死亡。**乌克兰人将这一事件称为“饥饿大屠杀”（Holodomor），意思是死亡。**斯大林（Stalin）实际上切断了他们的食物供应，逮捕、折磨或处决任何为自己保留食物的农民，并阻止乌克兰人离开他们的地区到其他地方购买面包。**这是苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（Soviet Union）集体化（collectivization）和斯大林（Stalin）残酷地试图巩固个人权力的真正毁灭性结果。 +

Okay, so World War One was fought, at least by American President Woodrow Wilson's reckoning, to make the world safe for democracy. But that didn't really work out too well because in the years between the two World Wars, totalitarian governments sprang up dang near everywhere in Europe. And so we need to figure out why that is. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a healthy dose of right and left-wing extremism, let's get to it.

So Woodrow Wilson's desire for democracy to flourish after World War One was not going to be a thing. Instead, what we see in several places across Europe is the rise of fascist states. And let me define that before going on. For a definition, let's consult the man who was most associated with the term, namely the Italian fascist Benito Mussolini. His chosen symbol for fascism was a bundle of sticks and an axe. What that represented was a group of people bound to the authority of a single powerful leader. So ultimately, fascism is a political philosophy that emphasizes obedience to an authoritarian leader and which leverages all the resources of the state to fulfill the leader's ambition.

Now we here in the 21st century are trained to think of fascism as a bad thing, and just to be clear, I agree -- like nobody wants to live under the rule of an authoritarian turd. But to Europeans in the inter-war years, fascism was an attractive option, and we need to understand why. The first reason was the proliferation of World War One bitterness. Many European societies were deeply divided along class lines in the post-war years because of the immense need for wartime production. The working class grew in power during the war while middle class power and influence declined because of the suffering of consumer industry.

There was also bitterness among gender lines as well. Many women had gone to work while their men were off fighting, and many of them cherished their newfound sense of importance to working society. But for the most part, when the men returned, women were expected to go back home and live their days making their husbands sandwiches, and that to many women was no bueno.

The second reason people were open to fascist states was the rise of communism. Many folks in Europe feared communism, especially in Russia, represented a fearful situation should it come to dominate other states in Europe. And just hold on to that for a second -- we'll talk about it more later.

The third reason people were open to fascist states was economic instability. Recall in the last video we talked about the devastating economic effects of the Great Depression. Huge percentages of the population were out of work, and inflation was out of control. There seemed to be no way out of it. It's hard to overestimate the insecurity such a condition caused among the average European. So when strong fascist leaders styled themselves as saviors from these conditions and put the blame for those conditions in all the right places and tapped into a powerful sense of victimization that people felt, for many people that seemed like a no-brainer.

Okay, so let's start with the birthplace of fascism proper and consider Mussolini's Italy. So all the social difficulties I just mentioned were present in Italy in the 1920s -- like high unemployment, severe war debt, etc. -- and the Italian government was not able to effectively deal with these problems. So Benito Mussolini, who started his career as a left-wing socialist, changed his position to extreme right-wing fascism because he saw that by championing those ideals he and his followers could gain power in Italy. He spoke ardently against communism, at least all of his language with a healthy dose of Italian nationalism.

So by 1922, after threatening to march on Rome with his army of fascists, the king of Italy made Mussolini the prime minister of Italy. Now only a few years later, the Italian parliament granted Mussolini dictatorial powers for a year, which as you can probably guess, he never gave up. So now Mussolini is in total control of Italy and worked quickly to establish a totalitarian fascist state. And how did he do it? Well first, he used modern technology and propaganda to spread his message to all Italians. These messages glorified war, exposed the dangers of democracy and communism, and most of all demonstrated how fascism was the answer to the political and economic instability of the post-war world. For anyone who was disillusioned by the state of post-war Europe, especially for those countries who had lost the war, these appeals made a whole lot of sense.

A second, Mussolini made use of a secret police which in Italy was known as the Blackshirts. For Mussolini, violence was key to squashing any dissent to his message and plan. Many of the members of the secret police were students and war veterans who were eager to use violence in an unrestricted way. And one of their favorite ways to keep people in line was by giving dissenters horse doses of castor oil. If you don't know what that is, it's basically a naturally occurring diuretic which in small doses, you know, gets things moving down. But the secret police would pour whole bottles of this stuff into people's mouths, and that would have them suffering from violent diarrhea for days, which was not only inconvenient but could often lead to death through dehydration. So you know, that's fun.

But despite Mussolini's tactics, Italy never fully came entirely under his control. The Italian monarchy and the armed forces retained some degree of independence. But if you want an example of a fascist state which gained entire control over the state -- and I know that you do -- then let's go visit Germany during the interwar years.

The next fascist state to emerge was in Germany under the leadership of supreme historical turd Adolf Hitler. And again, after World War One, Germany maybe more than any other European nation suffered terror because they received the most severe punishments from the Treaty of Versailles. Their economy went down the toilet, and they were humiliated on the international stage. And because the Weimar government could not address these problems, many German people were ripe for the extremist policies of Adolf Hitler.

Now early in his life, Hitler developed deeply rooted racialist ideas, most notably a virulent anti-Semitism, which is to say a hatred of the Jews. By the 1920s, Hitler had gained control of the National Socialist German Workers Party, which for short was known as the Nazi Party. Throughout the beginning of the '20s, the Nazis gained more and more power in Germany, and by the beginning of the 1930s, Hitler, like Mussolini, convinced the parliament to grant him emergency dictatorial powers, and like Mussolini, he never gave them up.

So with Hitler in power, he used many of the same tactics as Mussolini to stay in power but was much more effective in his use of those tactics. Hitler used the radio, video, and television to broadcast his speeches, which were positively overflowing with nationalist messages, anti-Semitic claims, and plans to restore the glory of Germany. In fact, Hitler had his own propaganda minister named Joseph Goebbels -- that Goebbels -- who harnessed the power of film to get Hitler in front of the eyes of Germans across the country. Filming Hitler's powerful speeches and his adoring fans lined up to greet him in downtown parades had a way of making Hitler's appeal seem universal.

Now Hitler also made use of a secret police known as the Schutzstaffel, or SS for short. The SS introduced no small amount of terror to anyone who opposed Hitler in his policies, and all of it was organized by a guy named Heinrich Himmler. And I pray to the good Lord in heaven that I am not somehow related to this guy because he was the worst. Himmler was the architect of murder and oppression, the organizer of concentration camps, and the main proponent of purifying the races of Germany. So I'm not even going to look for a family connection there -- like I think I'd rather not know.

Now while all this is going on in Italy and Germany, similar episodes were occurring in Spain. Because of the economic and political turmoil in the years right after the war, Spain went into a tailspin. There the Great Depression ultimately led to the lapse of parliamentary democracy, and that is when competing factions began fighting for dominance. By 1936, a group of leftists called the Popular Front took control, and their group represented the interest of workers and communists.

Now the one group who vehemently opposed this new government was the Spanish Army, led by General Francisco Franco. He led a violent uprising against the Popular Front and installed himself as the head of state, and this forcible seizure of power led directly to the Spanish Civil War between Franco and the Popular Front. Now the reason the Civil War is relevant to what we're talking about here is not just that Franco was another fascist-like dictator, but the Spanish Civil War represented a kind of testing ground for World War II. And here's what I mean: because fascist dictators love to see other fascist dictators come to power, Franco gained the support for his cause from both Hitler and Mussolini.

"Franco, let me ask you something: how do you feel about explosive diarrhea?"
"I love it."
"All right, I'm in. I'm in."

However, the Popular Front didn't receive nearly as much support from the Western democracies of Europe, and ultimately Franco won that war and ruled Spain without rival. And I said this war was a testing ground for World War II, and that's because Hitler and Mussolini observed with great relish that when fascism asserted itself in Europe, Western democracies did almost nothing to oppose it. And that will be a useful bit of information that they will put right in their pockets and come back to in the second half of the 1930s.

But totalitarian governments are not only being installed in Western Europe. Eastern Europe jumped in on the fascist party too. Recall that several new states were created in the East after World War One, and they were established as parliamentary democracies. But those democracies suffered first of all with all the same economic problems plaguing the rest of the continent, and second of all because democracy was a very new thing to them, and it is difficult to establish such a system in the midst of a deep economic slump. You just want someone to come in and solve all your problems, and that is how fascist and authoritarian governments were installed in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and other states as well.

And speaking of authoritarian governments, let's check in with Russia, now officially known as the Soviet Union. Last time we visited, the Russian Revolution was freshly over, and Lenin had turned Russia into a communist state. It's important to know here that while right-wing fascists despise communism, the Communist Soviet Union was very similar in a lot of ways, which is to say authoritarianism is just as likely on the left wing as it is on the right. Anyway, after Lenin died, Joseph Stalin rose to power in his place. And I know that I said that Himmler was the worst, but this guy is also the worst -- like there's just so many worst in this video.

Stalin was responsible for sending over a million political dissidents to forced labor camps called gulags, and he had no qualms about allowing torture to gain false confessions out of his enemies. Anyway, after consolidating party power under himself, Stalin implemented a Five-Year Plan, and the goal of this was to rapidly modernize -- which is to say industrialize -- the Soviet Union. The truth is the growth of Soviet industrialization during this period was staggering. You know, that's a good thing, right? Not so much. The consequences of that Five-Year Plan were devastating to the Russian people. Millions of workers flooded into these new industrial centers, and because Stalin wasn't much interested in providing decent housing for them, they lived in squalid conditions. But don't worry, their wages were rapidly decreasing as well. And why? Well, because Stalin told them through an elaborate propaganda campaign they were working for the progress of the socialist utopia promised them in the revolution.

Not only that, but after the first Five-Year Plan failed, criticism against Stalin reached a fever pitch, and many in the Communist Party called for his removal, not least of which was the luminary of Lenin's regime, Leon Trotsky. In response, Stalin authorized the Great Purge, which was a systematic removal of all Stalin's enemies from the state, which eventually filtered down to some Russian citizens as well. The Purge was carried out by Stalin's secret police, who imprisoned, tortured, and executed those who disagreed with Stalin.

By now it should go without saying that totalitarian states made frequent use of their secret police forces to silence political dissent. Additionally, during Lenin's time, a wealthy group of landowners called kulaks emerged and employed peasants to work their land. Stalin, however, believed that such a class of people were nothing but dirty capitalists and had no place in the Soviet Union. So he implemented a plan of collectivization in which land was taken from these landowners and placed under the authority of the state. And this happened in many places, but the consequences were most severe in Ukraine, which was the Soviet Union's most abundant producer of grain.

Because the Ukrainian kulaks so deeply resented Stalin's collectivization program and worked hard to resist and undermine it, Stalin responded with a policy that would lead to the starvation and death of something like 7 million people in the Ukraine region alone. It was an event that the Ukrainians dubbed the Holodomor, which means death. Stalin literally cut off their food supply, arrested, tortured, or executed any farmer who withheld food for themselves, and blocked Ukrainians from leaving their region to buy bread elsewhere. It was a truly devastating result of Soviet collectivization and Stalin's ruthless attempts to consolidate power under himself.
