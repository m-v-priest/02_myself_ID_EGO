So back in the previous period of AP Euro 美国大学预修课程欧洲历史, states 国家 fought (v.) each other all the dang （俚语，该死地；完全地） time, and that is not going to change /in this period. But the reason for the tension 紧张关系 between states and all the fighting is going to change. The last period 强调句 *it was* religion *that* got (v.) everybody all _hot and bothered_ (烦（恼）的；感到讨厌的)烦躁不安. 上一个时期是宗教让每个人都感到愤怒和烦恼, but in this period, states are going *to engage in* 从事 diplomacy 外交 and *go to war* /in order to maintain (v.) a balance of power 权力平衡 in Europe.  +
So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. Oh, and if you want note guides 笔记指南 for this video, link in the description. +

So after _the Peace of Westphalia_ 威斯特伐利亚和约 effectively 有效地 ended (v.)  the religious motivation 宗教动机 for warfare 战争 in 1648, a new reason for _tensions among states_ arrived, namely 即 the maintenance of the balance of power 维持权力平衡.  +
States during this period operated (v.) largely _on the principle 根据…的原则 of_ self-interest 自身利益原则, and the main goal was *to make sure that* each state held roughly 大致地 the same amount of power /so that no one state could dominate (v.) the rest 主导其他国家.  +
However, that *makes it sound like* European states were all about *seeking (v.) peace* during this period, but in truth -- in order to maintain (v.) that balance of power -- rulers began *building up* their armies 扩充军队. They would say that /they did it for defensive purposes 防御目的, but they often *used (v.) them offensively* 冒犯地；讨厌地;进攻地 as well 进攻性地. And you know, we'll talk about that in a moment. +

But this effort to maintain the balance of power /not only led to war, it also led to new efforts in diplomacy 外交努力. In case you don't know, diplomacy 外交 is when states *come to agreements* 通过达成协议 by talking (v.) /*instead of* shooting (v.) lead 铅,子弹 into each other's bodies on the battlefield 在战场上互相射击.  +
Diplomacy during this period *was largely focused on* dynastic interest 王朝利益, which is to say (v.)换句话说 `主` rulers' motivations 动机 for making agreements `系` was to secure (v.（尤指经过努力而）获得，得到；使安全，保护 _power and land_ for their heir 为继承人确保权力和土地.  ++

Now in general, `主` those states that were able *to consolidate (v.) power* 巩固权力 under the monarch 君主 and *raise (v.) large standing 永久的，长期的，常设的 armies* 庞大的常备军 `谓` *fared (v.)成功（或不成功、更好等） better* 表现更好 in this period /*than* those that did not. Occasion point 例证: the partition 分割，分裂（国家）；（用隔板、隔扇等）隔开，分隔 of Poland 瓜分波兰. +

This idea of maintaining (v.) the balance of power `谓` *sealed 封闭；盖印 the fate of* 决定了……的命运 Poland /and essentially 本质上 *wiped it off the map* 把它从地图上抹去了;从地图上抹去 for 150 years.  +

_The Commonwealth （用于某些政治上相互有联系的国家集团的名称）联合体 of Poland_ 波兰联邦 was massive 庞大的 /and included Lithuania 立陶宛, Belarus 白俄罗斯, and Latvia 拉脱维亚 and more. But despite being the largest territorial state 领土面积最大的国家 in Europe at the time, Poland had some problems.  +
Poland itself was a constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制国家, but it *was riddled 充满；充斥 with* weaknesses 充满弱点.

- The _landed nobles_ 拥有土地的贵族 exploited (v.) the peasantry 剥削农民 /and made a habit of 养成习惯 defying (v.) the king 违抗国王.  +
- Additionally 此外, they did not have the robust bureaucracy 强大的官僚机构 like Britain /to unite (v.) the country 团结国家, and they had been weakened (v.) by almost constant decades of war 几十年持续不断的战争削弱.  +
- Now *add (v.) to that* 除此之外 the Commonwealth of Poland's monarch 君主 was relatively weak (a.)  when *compared to* the absolute states 专制国家 that surrounded it -- which were Russia *led by* Catherine II 叶卡捷琳娜二世统治的俄罗斯, Prussia *led by* Frederick II 腓特烈二世统治的普鲁士, and Austria *led by* Joseph II 约瑟夫二世统治的奥地利.  +

If there's anything you don't want to be in this period, it's a weak state 弱国 situated (v.)坐落在……的，位于……的 right in the middle of three strong states with  expansionist (a.)扩张主义的 appetite (食欲，胃口；欲望，爱好) 有扩张野心的强国. +

Now the balance of power between those three states `系` was initially 开始，最初 unbalanced (a.)失衡 by Russia's victory against the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国, which made Russia the stronger nation in this central European sphere 中欧地区.  +
So Frederick II of Prussia about *pooped (v.)拉屎；大便 his pants* (裤子)（俚语，吓得屁滚尿流） at this development 因此，普鲁士的腓特烈二世对这一发展感到震惊. He could see that *the more* Turkish territory Russia *gobbled 吞虎咽地吃，大口吞食 up* 吞并, *the stronger* they would become.  +
And so his proposal (n.)提议，建议；提案 to Russia was that /they should *expand into* Poland /*instead of* continuing (a.) expansion into the Ottoman Empire.

So in 1772, Russia, Austria, and Prussia *signed (v.) a treaty* which *was ratified* (v.) by 由……批准 the Polish legislature 波兰立法机构 -- because you know _what else could they do_ 他们还能做什么呢 -- that granted (v.) about half of Poland's territory *to be divided* among these three paths 三方.  +
A similar agreements *took place* over the next 25 years, and eventually all of Poland *was annexed (v.)强占，并吞（国家、地区等） into* 被吞并 these three rival powers 敌对势力 /and disappeared from the map. Bad for Poland, but it was an example of states 后定 using (v.) diplomacy *instead of* war /to maintain (v.) the balance of power in Europe. +

Now `主` this need 后定 to maintain (v.) the balance of power across Europe `谓` also increasingly *led to war* among various states 各国之间的战争, and I reckon 认为 /we ought to talk about a few of them.

First let's consider (v.) the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国. The Ottoman Empire was massive 巨大的；大而重的；结实的 in the 17th century /and held (v.) possessions 领地 in southeastern Europe 东南欧. They had ambitions 野心 *to push (v.) further* into central Europe 进一步向中欧推进, and so they attempted to invade (v.) Austria 入侵奥地利 in the Battle of Vienna 维也纳之战 -- which was the capital of the Habsburg Empire 哈布斯堡帝国的首都 -- in 1683 in order to secure (v.) better trading routes 确保更好的贸易路线 along the Danube River 多瑙河.  +
Now in order to *keep* this expansion *from happening* 为了防止扩张发生 /and upsetting (v.)打翻；使倾覆 the balance of power in Europe 破坏欧洲权力平衡, the Austrian Habsburgs 奥地利哈布斯堡王朝 and then Poland (before they got all *gobbled up* 狼吞虎咽；贪婪地吃 by Russia, Prussia, and Austria) and the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国 united (v.) /to stop (v.) the invasion 联合阻止入侵 and did so successfully.  +
This became a major _turning point_ 转折点 in European history /because after this defeat, the Ottomans officially ceased (v.) their expansion into eastern Europe 停止向东欧扩张. +

But it wouldn't be a complete explanation 完整说明 of maintaining the balance of power through war /if we didn't talk about the French monarch Louis XIV 法国君主路易十四. Dude （俚语，家伙） engaged in 参与 almost constant (a.) warfare 持续不断的战争 /in order to pursue (v.) his own dynastic (a.)王朝的；朝代的 and state interests 王朝和国家利益.  +

There are three reasons Louis did this:

- first, because he wanted to expand (v.) the territory of France 扩张法国领土;
- second, he wanted to weaken (v.) Habsburg influence across Europe 削弱哈布斯堡王朝在欧洲的影响力 (*prior to* this period /Habsburg empowered (v.)增加（某人的）自主权；使控制局势 dang（等于damn） near everywhere in Europe 此前哈布斯堡王朝几乎在欧洲各地掌权, and that's _no bueno_ 不好 for the balance of power 这对权力平衡不利);
- and third, the man just wanted to increase (v.) his own glory 增加自己的荣耀. And *that's crazy to me* /because if `主` that hair `谓` don't *make your cup overflow* (v.)(漫出，泛滥 )极度满足、荣耀满溢 with personal glory （俚语，头发都不能彰显荣耀的话）, I don't know what else would. +

[.my1]
.案例

.no bueno
不好：源自西班牙语，用于表示某事物不好或不理想。

.that hair don’t *make your cup overflow* with personal glory
- that hair"​​指路易十四著名的​​长卷假发​​（当时欧洲贵族流行戴夸张的假发，象征地位和时尚）。
- cup overflow"​​：源自《圣经》短语 "my cup runneth over"（我的福杯满溢），比喻​​极度满足、荣耀满溢​​。
- "personal glory"​​：指路易十四对​​个人荣耀的追求​​（他自称“太阳王”，认为自己是国家的中心）。

字面意思是：​​“如果那顶假发还不能让你的荣耀感爆棚，我真不知道还有什么能了！”​  +
作者用反讽语气说：路易十四的假发已经夸张到极致了，如果连这都无法满足他的虚荣心（personal glory），那他的自恋程度简直不可救药。
呼应前文路易十四发动战争的第三个理由——纯粹为了​​个人荣耀​​（而非国家利益）。

.Louis XIV
image:/img/Louis XIV.avif[,50%]

路易十四,也被称太阳王, 在位时间为 72 年零 110 天，是历史上在位时间最长的君主 。 +
作为欧洲专制主义时代的象征， 路易十四的遗产包括:

- **他巩固了法国的"君主专制"制度，这种制度一直持续到法国大革命 。**路易十四信奉"君权神授"，他继承了路易十三的事业，建立了一个由首都统治的中央集权国家 。路易十四强迫许多贵族成员居住在奢华的凡尔赛宫， 以消除法国部分地区封建主义的残余。
- 他在天主教会领导下实行宗教统一。废除了"南特敕令" ，剥夺了胡格诺派"新教"少数派的权利.
- 哈布斯堡王朝三十年战争的结束
- 法国的殖民扩张
- 将凡尔赛宫改建成王室权力和政治中心。

在路易长期统治期间，法国成为欧洲主要强国 ，并经常发动战争。

根据菲利普·德·库尔西永的日记 ，路易在临终前对他的继承人说了这样的话：

Do not follow (v.) the bad example which I have set you; I have often *undertaken (v.)从事；开始进行 war* too lightly /and have sustained (v.)维持，保持 it for vanity 虚荣（心），自负. Do not imitate (v.)模仿，仿效 me, but *be* a peaceful prince, and *#may 祝，愿（用于表达愿望） you#* *apply (v.) yourself principally 主要地；大部分 to* the alleviation (n.)减轻，缓和；镇痛物 of the burdens of your subjects.

不要效仿我给你们树立的坏榜样；我常常轻率地发动战争，并为了虚荣而维持战争。不要效仿我，而要做一个爱好和平的君主，愿你主要致力于减轻臣民的负担。

**一些历史学家指出，#在那个年代，夸大自己的罪孽是虔诚的惯常表现。因此，他们在评价路易十六的政绩时，并不太重视他的临终遗言。相反，他们更关注军事和外交上的成就，#**例如他如何将一位法国王子扶上西班牙王位。他们认为，这结束了历史上"干涉法国内政的侵略性西班牙"的威胁。 +
这些历史学家还强调了**路易十六的战争, 在扩张法国疆域和建立更易防御的边界方面, 所发挥的作用，这些边界在法国大革命之前, 一直保护法国免遭入侵。**

路易的批评者认为，他巨额的外交、军事和国内开支, 使法国陷入贫困和破产。

Anyway, Louis fought (v.) the Dutch War 法荷战争 *to gain (v.) territory* in the Spanish Netherlands 西属尼德兰 /and to weaken (v.) the Habsburgs, which was ultimately unsuccessful 最终失败. But that didn't *keep* Louis XIV *from* remaining the most powerful monarch in Europe 保持欧洲最强大君主的地位.  +
Then Louis fought (v.) the Nine Years' War 九年战争 in which he tried *to push into* the Holy Roman Empire 进军神圣罗马帝国 to gain (v.) territory there.  +
Seeing how Louie's relentless (a.)坚韧的，不屈不挠的；残酷无情的，不留情面的；不停的，不间断的 expansionism 无情的扩张主义 would seriously disrupt (v.) ) the balance of power 严重破坏权力平衡 -- *shifting (v.) it* in Louie's favor 向路易有利的方向倾斜 -- several states *formed (v.) the Grand Alliance* 大同盟 to oppose (v.)反对.  +
_The Grand Alliance_ included the Habsburgs in the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国的哈布斯堡王朝 and the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国 and England and Spain and Sweden and Portugal 葡萄牙. And with that kind of stiff resistance 顽强抵抗, the Nine Years' War *did not go so well* for Lewis 路易. +

But `主` the most significant of Louie's wars concerning (v.)关于，涉及 the balance of power `系` was the War of Spanish Succession 西班牙王位继承战争, fought from 1701 to 1713. And this war was *less* about territorial expansion 领土扩张 *than* it was about Louie's dynastic interest 王朝利益.

这场战争**与其说是**为了领土扩张，**不如说是**为了路易的王朝利益

So when Charles II of Spain 西班牙的查理二世 died, it was arranged that Philip V 腓力五世 would succeed 继承王位. The saucy part 有趣的部分 was that Philip was actually Louis XIV's grandson 路易十四的孙子. Several European nations feared this arrangement /because *it meant that* potentially France and Spain could be combined (v.) and ruled by a single throne (（君王的）宝座) 由一个君主统治 -- namely Louis XIV's throne -- and *that would mean that* the balance of power in Europe would be, to use (v.) the technical term 用专业术语来说, wonky (a.)靠不住的；摇晃的，动摇的 as hell （俚语，混乱不堪）.  +
Like _not only_ *would* the consolidation 合并 of France and Spain *be worrisome* (a.)令人担忧的 on the European continent 欧洲大陆, _but_ then throw in 加上;添加，投入 all the _colonial holdings_ (n.占有的财产；所持股份) 殖民地 across the world 后定 that belonged to these two states, and well, you know (v.), not good.  +
If that consolidation happened, there will be no one in Europe who could *stand against* 公開反對 that _magnificently 壮丽地，宏伟地；壮观地 quaffed （俚语，发型考究的）, tights-wearing 穿紧身裤的 absolutist monarch_ 专制君主 Louis XIV. +

[.my2]
这一安排让欧洲多国深感不安，因为这意味着法国和西班牙可能合并，并由同一个王权统治（即路易十四的王权）。用专业术语来说，欧洲的均势将因此​​“彻底崩坏”​​。 +
想想看：​​法西合并​​不仅会让欧陆各国忧心忡忡，若再加上两国遍布全球的殖民地……嗯，懂的都懂，​​绝对是大灾难​​。倘若成真，欧洲将无人能抗衡那位​​头戴华丽假发、身穿紧身裤的绝对主义君主​​——路易十四。

And so war immediately *broke out* /to prevent (v.) the scenario 设想，可能发生的情况, with England, the United Provinces 联合省, Austria, and Prussia against France, Spain, and Bavaria 巴伐利亚. Now up against 面对 all those other states, you would think that France would lose (v.)  quick, fast, and in a hurry 很快失败. But this is Louis we're talking about, and although he lost a few decisive battles 决定性战役, he was able *to fight well enough* to bring the rest of those states to the negotiating table 谈判桌 in what was ultimately a draw 平局.  +
The war ended (v.) in 1713 in the Treaty of Utrecht 乌得勒支和约, which did a lot of things, but for our purposes 但就我们的目的而言 /we just need *to point out that* the treaty stipulated (v.)规定；保证 that Philip the Fifth would remain (v.) on the Spanish throne /but that France and Spain must remain (v.) separate entities 保持独立实体. So _the Treaty of Utrecht_ maintains (v.) the balance of power in Europe 维持了欧洲的权力平衡. +

Now I've been *dancing (v.) around* 绕圈子；回避 this key development 关键发展 for a few minutes now, so let's talk directly about how the military of various states changed (v.) /during this period. Prior to this period, states would *declare (v.) war* on 向……宣战 each other /and then go raise (v.) their arms 召集军队. But now states *commissioned* (v.)委任,任命…为军官 and *paid for* 支付费用 professional standing armies 专业常备军. What was especially notable 显著的 was the increasing size of these armies 军队规模扩大.  +
Louis XIV gets the prize here for the largest standing army 最大的常备军, *coming in* at nearly 400,000 soldiers 接近40万士兵 -- which is something that had never been seen before 前所未见. But every absolute estate 专制国家 increased (v.) the size of their army as well 也扩充了军队规模. +

Notable 显要的，值得注意的 during this period was the military genius 军事天才 of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden 瑞典的古斯塔夫·阿道夫. Adolphus built a massive professional standing (a.) army 庞大的专业常备军 which was highly organized into _ascending 上升的，增长的；升（序）的 rank_ 等级分明 /so that the hierarchy of authority 权力等级制度 was clear.  +
Additionally 此外, new military technology was developed 开发 -- *from* firearms 火器 *to* mobile cannon 移动火炮 *to more* elaborate (a.)复杂的，详尽的；精心制作的 fortification (碉堡，防御工事) 更复杂的防御工事. +

All this expansion, of course, had to *be paid for* 支付费用. Adolphus and other military expansionists 军事扩张者 in Europe *paid for* these armies /with increased taxes 增税 and an expanding bureaucracy 扩大官僚机构 to administrate (v.)管理，经营 that /in _increased (a.) revenue_ 管理增加的收入. Altogether 完全地；总共；总之 `主` *this development `系` was* something of a military revolution 军事革命 across Europe. +

[.my2]
当然，所有这些扩张都需要付出代价。阿道夫斯和其他欧洲的军事扩张主义者, 通过增加税收和扩大官僚机构, 来管理这些军队，从而增加了收入。总的来说，这一发展是一场席卷欧洲的军事革命。

This is important to understand /because it affected (v.) the balance of power in Europe significantly 极大地影响了欧洲的权力平衡.  强调句 *It was* those nations who expanded their military in the ways that I just mentioned /*that* found themselves on the winning side of that balance of power 处于权力平衡的有利一方. +

== 中文释义

在美国大学预修课程欧洲历史的上一个时期，各国一直都在相互争斗，而**在这个时期，**这种情况并没有改变。但是**#各国之间的紧张关系, 以及所有争斗的原因, 却发生了变化。在上一个时期，是"宗教"让所有人都躁动不安，但在这个时期，各国为了维持欧洲的"权力平衡"(势力均衡政策)，开始进行外交活动并发动战争。#**所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。哦，如果你想要这个视频的笔记指南，描述里有链接。  +

**#在1648年《威斯特伐利亚和约》有效地结束了战争的"宗教动机"之后，各国之间紧张关系有了一个新的原因，那就是"维持权力平衡"。#**在这个时期，各国在很大程度上是基于自身利益原则行事的，**主要目标是##确保每个国家都拥有大致相同的权力，这样就没有一个国家能够统治其他国家(一家独大, 变成秦并六国)。##**然而，这听起来好像欧洲各国在这个时期都在寻求和平，但实际上，**为了维持权力平衡，统治者们开始扩充他们的军队。**他们会说这么做是出于防御目的，但实际上他们也经常将军队用于进攻。我们一会儿会谈到这一点。  +

但是，这种"维持权力平衡"的努力, 不仅引发了战争，还催生了新的外交努力。如果你不知道的话，**外交就是各国通过谈判达成协议，而不是在战场上互相开火。这个时期的外交, 在很大程度上集中在"王朝利益"上，也就是说，统治者达成协议的动机, 是为他们的继承人确保权力和土地。#(在"维持权力平衡"的目的方面,)总的来说，那些能够在君主的领导下巩固权力, 并建立庞大常备军的国家, 在这个时期比那些做不到的国家发展得更好。#**一个典型的例子就是波兰的瓜分。  +

这种"维持权力平衡"的理念, 决定了波兰的命运，基本上让波兰从地图上消失了大约150年。"波兰立陶宛联邦"（Commonwealth of Poland）幅员辽阔，包括立陶宛、白俄罗斯, 和拉脱维亚等地区。但是，*尽管波兰当时是欧洲领土最大的国家之一，它却存在一些问题。波兰本身是一个"君主立宪制"国家，但它存在诸多弱点。① 拥有土地的贵族, 剥削农民，并且习惯于违抗国王。② 此外，波兰没有像英国那样强大的官僚机构来统一国家，③ 而且几十年来, 一直因战争而被削弱。④ 再加上与周边的"专制国家"相比，"波兰立陶宛联邦"的君主相对软弱*——这些"专制国家"包括叶卡捷琳娜二世（Catherine II）领导的俄罗斯、腓特烈二世（Frederick II）领导的普鲁士, 和约瑟夫二世（Joseph II）领导的奥地利。在这个时期，最不想成为的, 就是处于三个有扩张野心的强国中间的弱国。  +

当时，这三个国家之间的权力平衡, 最初因为俄罗斯对奥斯曼帝国的胜利, 而被打破，这使得**俄罗斯在中欧地区成为更强大的国家。所以普鲁士的腓特烈二世（Frederick II）对这一发展感到十分紧张。他看到俄罗斯吞并的土耳其领土越多，就会变得越强大。**于是，他向俄罗斯提议，他们应该向波兰扩张，而不是继续向奥斯曼帝国扩张。所以**在1772年，俄罗斯、奥地利和普鲁士签署了一项条约，波兰议会也批准了这项条约——因为他们也别无选择——根据该条约，大约一半的波兰领土被这三个国家瓜分。在接下来的25年里，类似的协议不断出现，最终整个波兰被这三个敌对国家吞并，从地图上消失了。**这对波兰来说很糟糕，但这是各国通过外交手段而不是战争, 来维持欧洲权力平衡的一个例子。  +

**#这种维持"欧洲权力平衡"的需求, 也日益导致各国之间爆发战争 (就跟现在的中美贸易战一样. 美国要平衡掉中国的变得强大带来的威胁)，#**我觉得我们应该谈谈其中的一些战争。首先让我们来看看奥斯曼帝国。**17世纪的奥斯曼帝国非常庞大，在东南欧拥有领土。他们有野心进一步向中欧推进(犹如中国的战国时期, 各国都想要对外扩张领土)，**所以在1683年，他们试图通过"维也纳之战"（Battle of Vienna）入侵奥地利，维也纳是"哈布斯堡帝国"（Habsburg Empire）的首都，他们这么做是为了确保沿着多瑙河有更好的贸易路线。为了阻止这种扩张, 并维护欧洲的权力平衡，奥地利哈布斯堡王朝，以及当时还未被俄罗斯、普鲁士和奥地利吞并的波兰，还有神圣罗马帝国, 联合起来成功地阻止了入侵。这成为了欧洲历史上的一个重大转折点，因为**在这次失败之后，奥斯曼帝国正式停止了向东南欧的扩张。**  +

但是，如果我们不谈谈**法国君主路易十四**（Louis XIV），对于通过战争"维持权力平衡"的解释就不完整。这家伙为了追求自己的王朝和国家利益，**几乎不停地发动战争。路易十四这么做有三个原因：首先，他想扩张法国的领土；其次，他想削弱"哈布斯堡王朝"在欧洲的影响力（在这一时期之前，哈布斯堡王朝在欧洲几乎无处不在，这对权力平衡可没好处）；第三，这家伙只是想增加自己的荣耀。**对我来说这很疯狂，因为如果那样的发型（暗指路易十四的发型很夸张）都不能让他的个人荣耀感爆棚，我不知道还有什么能做到。  +

不管怎样，路易十四发动了荷兰战争（Dutch War），试图在"西属尼德兰"（Spanish Netherlands）获得领土, 并削弱哈布斯堡王朝，但最终没有成功。但这并没有阻止路易十四成为欧洲最强大的君主。然后路易十四又发动了九年战争（Nine Years' War），在这场战争中，他试图进入"神圣罗马帝国"获取领土。**看到路易十四无情的扩张主义会严重破坏"权力平衡"——而且这种平衡, 朝着对路易十四有利的方向倾斜——几个国家组成了大联盟（Grand Alliance）来反对他。**大联盟包括神圣罗马帝国的哈布斯堡王朝、荷兰共和国、英国、西班牙和瑞典。由于遭到如此强硬的抵抗，九年战争对路易十四来说并不顺利。  +

但是，路易十四的战争中，*与"权力平衡"最相关的, 是"西班牙王位继承战争"*（War of Spanish Succession），这场战争从1701年打到1713年。这场战争与其说是为了领土扩张，不如说是为了路易十四的王朝利益。所以当西班牙的查理二世（Charles II of Spain）去世时，安排菲利普五世（Philip V）继承王位。有意思的是，**菲利普实际上是路易十四的孙子。几个欧洲国家担心这种安排，因为这意味着法国和西班牙有可能联合起来，**由同一个王位统治——也就是路易十四的王位——这意味着欧洲的"权力平衡"，用专业术语来说，会变得一团糟。因为法国和西班牙的合并, 不仅在欧洲大陆上令人担忧，**而且考虑到这两个国家在世界各地的殖民地，情况就更不妙了。**如果这种合并发生，欧洲将没有人能够对抗那个有着华丽发型、穿着紧身裤的专制君主路易十四。  +

所以为了阻止这种情况发生，战争立即爆发了，英国、联合省（United Provinces）、奥地利和普鲁士, 对抗法国、西班牙和巴伐利亚。面对这么多其他国家，你可能会认为法国会很快战败。但我们说的是路易十四，尽管他输掉了几场决定性的战役，但他还是能够顽强抵抗，最终让其他国家坐到了谈判桌前，战争以平局告终。1713年，**这场战争以《乌得勒支和约》（Treaty of Utrecht）结束，**该和约做了很多事情，但就我们的目的而言，我们只需要指出**该和约规定, 菲利普五世将继续坐在西班牙王位上，但法国和西班牙必须保持独立实体。所以《乌得勒支和约》维护了欧洲的权力平衡。**  +

我刚才一直在绕着一个关键的发展打转，所以让我们直接谈谈这个时期, 各国的军事是如何变化的。在这个时期之前，各国会相互宣战，然后征兵参战。但**现在各国开始组建并供养专业的"常备军"。**尤其值得注意的是这些军队规模越来越大。路易十四拥有近40万士兵的庞大常备军，这是前所未有的，他因此在这方面拔得头筹。但每个"专制国家"也都增加了自己军队的规模。  +

这个时期，瑞典的古斯塔夫·阿道夫（Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden）展现出了军事天赋。阿道夫建立了一支庞大的专业常备军，军队组织严密，等级分明，指挥层级清晰。此外，新的军事技术得到了发展——从火器到移动大炮，再到更复杂的防御工事。当然，所有这些扩张都需要资金支持。阿道夫和欧洲其他军事扩张主义者, 通过增加税收, 和扩大官僚机构, 来管理增加的收入，以此为军队提供资金。总的来说，这一发展可以说是欧洲的一场军事革命。  +

理解这一点很重要，因为它对欧洲的"权力平衡"产生了重大影响。正是那些以我刚才提到的方式扩充军事力量的国家，在"权力平衡"中占据了优势。  +

So back in the previous period of AP Euro, states fought each other all the dang time, and that is not going to change in this period. But the reason for the tension between states and all the fighting is going to change. The last period it was religion that got everybody all hot and bothered, but in this period, states are going to engage in diplomacy and go to war in order to maintain a balance of power in Europe. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. Oh, and if you want note guides for this video, link in the description.

So after the Peace of Westphalia effectively ended the religious motivation for warfare in 1648, a new reason for tensions among states arrived, namely the maintenance of the balance of power. States during this period operated largely on the principle of self-interest, and the main goal was to make sure that each state held roughly the same amount of power so that no one state could dominate the rest. However, that makes it sound like European states were all about seeking peace during this period, but at noon -- in order to maintain that balance of power -- rulers began building up their armies. They would say that they did it for defensive purposes, but they often used them offensively as well. And you know, we'll talk about that in a moment.

But this effort to maintain the balance of power not only led to war, it also led to new efforts in diplomacy. In case you don't know, diplomacy is when states come to agreements by talking instead of shooting lead into each other's bodies on the battlefield. Diplomacy during this period was largely focused on dynastic interest, which is to say rulers' motivations for making agreements was to secure power and land for their heir. Now in general, those states that were able to consolidate power under the monarch and raise large standing armies fared better in this period than those that did not. Occasion point: the partition of Poland.

This idea of maintaining the balance of power sealed the fate of Poland and essentially wiped it off the map for 150 years. The Commonwealth of Poland was massive and included Lithuania, Belarus, and Latvia and more. But despite being the largest territorial state in Europe at the time, Poland had some problems. Poland itself was a constitutional monarchy, but it was riddled with weaknesses. The landed nobles exploited the peasantry and made a habit of defying the king. Additionally, they did not have the robust bureaucracy like Britain to unite the country, and they had been weakened by almost constant decades of war. Now add to that the Commonwealth of Poland's monarch was relatively weak when compared to the absolute states that surrounded it -- which were Russia led by Catherine II, Prussia led by Frederick II, and Austria led by Joseph II. If there's anything you don't want to be in this period, it's a weak state situated right in the middle of three strong states with expansionist appetite.

Now the balance of power between those three states was initially unbalanced by Russia's victory against the Ottoman Empire, which made Russia the stronger nation in this central European sphere. So Frederick II of Prussia about pooped his pants at this development. He could see that the more Turkish territory Russia gobbled up, the stronger they would become. And so his proposal to Russia was that they should expand into Poland instead of continuing expansion into the Ottoman Empire. So in 1772, Russia, Austria, and Prussia signed a treaty which was ratified by the Polish legislature -- because you know what else could they do -- that granted about half of Poland's territory to be divided among these three paths. A similar agreements took place over the next 25 years, and eventually all of Poland was annexed into these three rival powers and disappeared from the map. Bad for Poland, but it was an example of states using diplomacy instead of war to maintain the balance of power in Europe.

Now this need to maintain the balance of power across Europe also increasingly led to war among various states, and I reckon we ought to talk about a few of them. First let's consider the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire was massive in the 17th century and held possessions in southeastern Europe. They had ambitions to push further into central Europe, and so they attempted to invade Austria in the Battle of Vienna -- which was the capital of the Habsburg Empire -- in 1683 in order to secure better trading routes along the Danube River. Now in order to keep this expansion from happening and upsetting the balance of power in Europe, the Austrian Habsburgs and then Poland (before they got all gobbled up by Russia, Prussia, and Austria) and the Holy Roman Empire united to stop the invasion and did so successfully. This became a major turning point in European history because after this defeat, the Ottomans officially ceased their expansion into eastern Europe.

But it wouldn't be a complete explanation of maintaining the balance of power through war if we didn't talk about the French monarch Louis XIV. Dude engaged in almost constant warfare in order to pursue his own dynastic and state interests. There are three reasons Louis did this: first, because he wanted to expand the territory of France; second, he wanted to weaken Habsburg influence across Europe (prior to this period Habsburg empowered dang near everywhere in Europe, and that's no bueno for the balance of power); and third, the man just wanted to increase his own glory. And that's crazy to me because if that hair don't make your cup overflow with personal glory, I don't know what else would.

Anyway, Louis fought the Dutch War to gain territory in the Spanish Netherlands and to weaken the Habsburgs, which was ultimately unsuccessful. But that didn't keep Louis XIV from remaining the most powerful monarch in Europe. Then Louis fought the Nine Years' War in which he tried to push into the Holy Roman Empire to gain territory there. Seeing how Louie's relentless expansionism would seriously disrupt the balance of power -- shifting it in Louie's favor -- several states formed the Grand Alliance to oppose. The Grand Alliance included the Habsburgs in the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic and England and Spain and Sweden and Portugal. And with that kind of stiff resistance, the Nine Years' War did not go so well for Lewis.

But the most significant of Louie's wars concerning the balance of power was the War of Spanish Succession, fought from 1701 to 1713. And this war was less about territorial expansion than it was about Louie's dynastic interest. So when Charles II of Spain died, it was arranged that Philip V would succeed. The saucy part was that Philip was actually Louis XIV's grandson. Several European nations feared this arrangement because it meant that potentially France and Spain could be combined and ruled by a single throne -- namely Louis XIV's throne -- and that would mean that the balance of power in Europe would be, to use the technical term, wonky as hell. Like not only would the consolidation of France and Spain be worrisome on the European continent, but then throw in all the colonial holdings across the world that belonged to these two states, and well, you know, not good. If that consolidation happened, there will be no one in Europe who could stand against that magnificently quaffed, tights-wearing absolutist monarch Louis XIV.

And so war immediately broke out to prevent the scenario, with England, the United Provinces, Austria, and Prussia against France, Spain, and Bavaria. Now up against all those other states, you would think that France would lose quick, fast, and in a hurry. But this is Louis we're talking about, and although he lost a few decisive battles, he was able to fight well enough to bring the rest of those states to the negotiating table in what was ultimately a draw. The war ended in 1713 in the Treaty of Utrecht, which did a lot of things, but for our purposes we just need to point out that the treaty stipulated that Philip the Fifth would remain on the Spanish throne but that France and Spain must remain separate entities. So the Treaty of Utrecht maintains the balance of power in Europe.

Now I've been dancing around this key development for a few minutes now, so let's talk directly about how the military of various states changed during this period. Prior to this period, states would declare war on each other and then go raise their arms. But now states commissioned and paid for professional standing armies. What was especially notable was the increasing size of these armies. Louis XIV gets the prize here for the largest standing army, coming in at nearly 400,000 soldiers -- which is something that had never been seen before. But every absolute estate increased the size of their army as well.

Notable during this period was the military genius of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Adolphus built a massive professional standing army which was highly organized into ascending rank so that the hierarchy of authority was clear. Additionally, new military technology was developed -- from firearms to mobile cannon to more elaborate fortification. All this expansion, of course, had to be paid for. Adolphus and other military expansionists in Europe paid for these armies with increased taxes and an expanding bureaucracy to administrate that in increased revenue. Altogether this development was something of a military revolution across Europe.

This is important to understand because it affected the balance of power in Europe significantly. It was those nations who expanded their military in the ways that I just mentioned that found themselves on the winning side of that balance of power.
