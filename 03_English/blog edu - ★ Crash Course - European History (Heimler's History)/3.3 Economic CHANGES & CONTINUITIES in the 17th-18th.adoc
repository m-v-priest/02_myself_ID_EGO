== 释义

At the end of the 17th century, a massive 巨大的 revolution in farming occurred and is known as the Agricultural Revolution 农业革命. So this video is all about how that happened and how it shifted 改变 the economic foundations 经济基础 of Europe. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked Jethro Tull's style, then let's get to it. +

Prior to 在……之前 this period, about 80 percent of the people in Europe lived and died by farming 以务农为生. England and the Dutch Republic being accepted -- and we'll get to that in a minute -- and while the farming techniques 农业技术 we've talked about elsewhere, like the two field system 二圃制 and the three field systems 三圃制, were able to feed a lot of people, for the most part 在大多数情况下 crops yielded 产出 only enough to survive and certainly not an abundance 大量. Additionally 此外, about every eight to ten years, some insane climate event 极端气候事件 caused crop failures 作物歉收 in large portions of people went hungry, and many of them died. +

But by the turn of the 18th century, farming in Britain and the Dutch Republic began to shift, and the methods that they pioneered 开创 would eventually spread to the rest of Europe. But what's crazy is that in those places, only about half the population was devoted to 致力于 farming, and yet the output 产量 of their farms tripled 增至三倍. If you want to know how they did it, I'm about to tell you. +

First of all, they abandoned 放弃 the three field system. For all the benefits it brought, it still required a third of the land to lie fallow 休耕 each year. The reason is because the constant threat to farmers was soil exhaustion 土壤肥力耗尽, meaning that in order to grow food, the soil gave up its nutrients 养分 to the plants, and if you plant enough crops in the same soil, all the nutrients will eventually be gone. But now what the English and Dutch discovered is that if they alternated 交替 grain crops 谷物, which leached nutrients from the soil 从土壤中吸取养分, with other crops which restored nutrients to the soil like potatoes and clover 三叶草, then their fields could produce crops with no yearly fallow period 无需每年休耕. And clover was especially important because it put nitrogen 氮 back in the soil, which was perhaps one of the most important nutrients 养分. Who cares? What's the point? The point is, my dear interlocutor 对话者, is that with this innovation 创新 in farming, the food output 产量 rose significantly 显著地, which also led to a population increase 人口增长, and that's going to become significant later. So put that in your pocket, and we'll come back to it later. +

Now along with 连同 new ways of planting, new technologies for farming also helped increase crop yield 作物产量. For example, Jethro Tull's seed drill 条播机 and mechanical hoe 机械锄头. The seed drill made sure that the seeds were planted at exact intervals 精确间隔 and then covered them with dirt 覆土, while the mechanical hoe was able to increase efficiency 效率 with which the weeds were removed from the soil 除草. But wait, there's more. Remember the Columbian Exchange 哥伦布大交换 from the last period? That was the result of European exploration 探索 in the Americas, and one of the big items being exchanged was food. Many different kinds of beans came into Europe as a result of it. Maybe the most significant American crop to be transferred 引进 was the potato 土豆. Originally 最初, Europeans felt like they were too good for potatoes. Like they reckoned 认为 it was good food for livestock 牲畜 but not for their table. But in time 随着时间推移, the potato became a staple 主食 of the peasantry 农民, and it significantly improved their lives because it was packed with nutrition 富含营养, and a small crop could feed a family heartily 丰盛地. +

So all of this taken together 综上所述 is what we call the Agricultural Revolution, and it both increased the amount of food available in Europe and contributed to 有助于 longer life spans 寿命 among the population. Now this population explosion 人口激增, combined with 与……相结合 the fewer people needed for farming, meant that a lot of people didn't have enough work, and that reality contributed to another significant economic change during this period, namely 即 the rapid expansion 快速扩张 of the cottage industry 家庭手工业. +

Now you probably know what a cottage 小屋 is -- it's a little house -- and you probably know what industry means -- it means making goods for sale 生产商品用于销售. So put them together, and what do you get? Making goods for sale in your little house, and that is the cottage industry. With fewer and fewer people needed for farming, rural households 农村家庭 needed to supplement 补充 their earnings with the cottage industry. Now the cottage industry was organized according to the putting-out system 外放制, and here's what that means: Merchant capitalists 商人资本家 would provide raw materials 原材料 to rural workers, who would then manufacture 制造 those materials into finished goods 制成品. Merchant would pay the worker and then go sell the finished goods on the market 市场. This arrangement 安排 laid the groundwork for 为……奠定基础 the Industrial Revolution's factory system 工业革命的工厂制度, but we'll get to that in another video. +

Now the cottage industry in rural areas was creating a significant stir 引起轰动, not least because it began competing with urban guild workers 城市行会工人 in the cities. If you were an artisan 工匠 and wanted to get paid for your work, you had to be a guild member 行会成员, and if you were a member, you had a certain amount of prestige 声望 and protection for your wage 工资保障. And if you were not a member -- in typical non-members included women and immigrants and Jews -- then you had to scratch out a living 勉强维持生计 on the margins of society 社会边缘. But with the putting-out system, those folks who were previously consigned to 被置于 the margins could work, albeit 尽管 for pretty low wages, apart from membership in a guild 无需加入行会. So that was a significant way in which labor and trade were increasingly freed from traditional restrictions 传统限制 imposed by governments and corporate entities 政府和企业实体. +

The growth of this kind of market economy 市场经济 led to an increasing demand for manufactured goods 制成品, which meant there was a push to get manufacturing out of people's homes and into these new buildings called factories 工厂. And nowhere was this shift 转变 more pronounced 明显的 than in England. The British wool industry 英国羊毛产业 was second to none 首屈一指. The putting-out system enabled many workers to specialize in their trade 专注于各自的工作. Some raised sheep, others processed wool, and still others wove fabric 织布, and then still others dyed 染色. And as Europeans began demanding more and more wool, Britain increased its production 产量, which led to more people working and earning decent wages 可观的工资 to boot 此外. Now the merchants paid the workers directly 直接支付工资, and that led to a growing money economy 货币经济 -- which, in case you couldn't discern 辨别, is an economy that runs on money -- and the growing money economy worked hand in hand with 与……携手 the growing market economy to create a seismic economic shift 巨大的经济变革 in Europe. +

Now market economy 市场经济 is one in which production and prices are determined strictly by competition between privately owned businesses 私营企业之间的竞争. Remember that after this period, mercantilism 重商主义 was the dominant economic system 主导经济体系 of Europe. This system was driven by the state 由国家主导, so it was the state who set prices and determined production schedules 生产计划. But in 1776, Adam Smith published the book The Wealth of Nations 国富论, in which he critiqued 批判 mercantilism and argued for 主张 an unregulated market 自由市场 which would be governed by the forces of supply and demand 由供求关系调节. To be clear 明确地说, there is not a hard line 明确界限 where mercantilism stopped and market economies started, but in this period we're in that muddy transition phase 模糊的过渡阶段. +

Regardless 无论如何, the growth of the market economy led to new financial practices and institutions 金融实践和机构, and I'm going to tell you about two. First was the introduction of insurance 保险. For monthly premium 月保费, insurance companies would recoup 弥补 an entrepreneur's losses 企业家的损失 if something catastrophic 灾难性的 happened, like a fire destroying a factory. With this kind of security 保障, entrepreneurs, especially in England, gained the confidence to invest metric but loads of money 大量资金 into the factories and growing inventories of goods for sale 不断增加的待售商品库存. Second was the rise of banks and venture capital 风险资本. Prior to 在……之前 1750, if you were an entrepreneur and wanted to build a factory, for example, they would have to borrow money from family or have a fortune of their own 依靠自己的财富. But with this explosion of commerce 商业繁荣 and the rise of the factory system 工厂制度兴起, specialty banks 专业银行 arose which kept only some of the money people deposited 保留部分存款 and then loaned the rest out as venture capital 贷出其余资金作为风险资本 to be paid back with interest 还本付息. +

And so with this development of the market economy, Europe had laid a foundation for 为……奠定基础 its expanding global role 不断扩大的全球角色, of which more in another video. Okay, right here the rest of my unit 3 videos, so get that clicky finger out and click. Additionally 此外, if you need help getting an A in your class and a five on your exam, then grab my note guides 笔记指南 for these videos right here. Thanks for coming along, I'll catch you on the flip-flop. I'm Laurent out. +

== 中文释义

**在17世纪末，一场大规模的农业革命发生了，**这场革命被称为"农业革命"。所以这个视频就是关于这场革命是如何发生的，以及它是如何改变欧洲的经济基础的。所以，如果你准备好像杰思罗·塔尔（Jethro Tull）那样充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

*在这一时期之前，欧洲大约80%的人靠农业为生和死亡。英国和荷兰共和国是例外情况*（我们马上会讲到）。并且，虽然我们在其他地方谈到的农业技术，比如两田制和三田制，能够养活很多人，但**在大多数情况下，农作物的产量仅够维持生计，绝对称不上富足。此外，大约每8到10年，一些极端的气候事件会导致大部分地区农作物歉收，许多人挨饿，其中不少人还会死亡。**  +

**但在18世纪初，英国和荷兰共和国的农业, 开始发生转变，**他们开创的农业方法, 最终会传播到欧洲其他地区。但令人惊讶的是，**在这些地方，只有大约一半的人口从事农业生产，然而他们农场的产量, 却增长到了原来的三倍。**如果你想知道他们是怎么做到的，我这就告诉你。  +

**首先，他们放弃了"三田制"。**尽管三田制带来了一些好处，但它仍然要求每年有三分之一的土地休耕。原因是农民一直面临着土壤肥力耗尽的威胁，这意味着为了种植粮食，土壤会将养分供给植物，如果你在同一块土地上种植足够多的作物，最终所有的养分都会流失。但**现在英国人和荷兰人发现，如果他们将从土壤中吸取养分的谷物作物，与像土豆和三叶草这样能恢复土壤养分的其他作物, 交替种植，那么他们的田地, 就可以在没有"每年休耕期"的情况下, 生产作物。**三叶草尤其重要，因为它能将氮元素重新补充到土壤中，而氮元素可能是最重要的养分之一。谁会在意呢？重点是什么呢？重点是，我亲爱的对话者，**随着这种农业创新，粮食产量大幅提高，这也导致了人口的增加，**而这一点在之后会变得非常重要。所以记住这一点，我们稍后还会提到。  +

除了新的种植方式，新的农业技术也有助于提高作物产量。例如，杰思罗·塔尔的"条播机"和"机械锄头"。**"条播机"能确保种子以精确的间隔种植，然后用泥土覆盖种子，而"机械锄头"能够提高从土壤中清除杂草的效率。**等等，还有更多。还记得上一时期的**"哥伦布大交换"**（Columbian Exchange）吗？那是欧洲对美洲探索的结果，其中一项重要的交换物品就是食物。**许多不同种类的豆类, 因此进入了欧洲。**也许从美洲转移过来的最重要的作物是土豆。**起初，欧洲人觉得土豆配不上自己。他们认为土豆是给牲畜吃的好食物，而不适合摆上他们的餐桌。但随着时间的推移，土豆成为了农民的主食，**它极大地改善了农民的生活，因为土豆富含营养，一小片土豆地的产出就能让一个家庭吃得丰盛。  +

所以所有这些合起来就是我们所说的农业革命，它既增加了欧洲的粮食供应量，也有助于提高人口的寿命。*现在，##人口的爆炸式增长，加上从事农业所需的人数减少，这意味着很多人没有足够的工作可做，而这一现实促成了##这一时期另一个重大的经济变化，也就是##家庭手工业的迅速扩张。##*  +

现在你可能知道“cottage”（小屋）是什么意思，也可能知道“industry”（产业）意味着什么，那么把它们放在一起，你得到了什么呢？**##在你的小屋里生产用于销售的商品，这就是"家庭手工业"（cottage industry）。##由于从事农业的人越来越少，农村家庭需要通"过家庭手工业"来补充收入。#"家庭手工业"是按照"外放制"(类似外包制)（putting-out system）组织起来的，这意味着：商业资本家会向农村工人提供原材料，然后农村工人将这些原材料加工成成品。商人会支付工人工资，然后将成品拿到市场上销售。这种安排为"工业革命"的"工厂制度"奠定了基础，#**但我们会在另一个视频中讲到这一点。  +

现在农村的**"家庭手工业"**引起了很大的轰动，这在很大程度上是因为**##它开始与城市的"行会工人"竞争。如果你是一名工匠，想要靠工作获得报酬，你就必须成为"行会成员"，如果你是成员，你的工资会有一定的声望和保障。如果你不是成员（通常非成员包括女性、移民和犹太人），那么你就只能在社会边缘艰难谋生。但有了"外放制"，那些以前被边缘化的人可以工作，尽管工资相当低，而且无需加入行会 (即低成本取代高成本. 相当于如今的国际产业链, 向劳动力成本低的地方转移了)。##所以，劳动力和贸易, 越来越多地摆脱了政府和企业实体施加的传统限制，**这是一个重要的方面。  +

**##这种市场经济的增长, 导致对"制成品"的需求不断增加，这意味着人们推动将制造业从"家庭"转移到被称为"工厂"的新建筑中 (相当于专业化了, 产业升级了)。##这种转变在英国表现得最为明显。**英国的羊毛产业无人能及。"外放制"使许多工人能够在自己的行业中"专业化"。有些人养羊，有些人加工羊毛，还有些人织布，另外一些人负责染色。随着欧洲人对羊毛的需求越来越多，英国增加了羊毛的产量，这使得更多的人有工作可做，并且能挣到可观的工资。*现在商人直接向工人支付工资，这导致了"货币经济"的增长*（以防你不明白，货币经济是指以货币为运行基础的经济），而不断增长的货币经济, 与不断发展的"市场经济"携手合作，在欧洲引发了巨大的经济变革。  +

现在，**市场经济是一种生产和价格, 严格由私营企业之间的竞争决定的经济模式。**记住，*在这一时期之后，重商主义（mercantilism）是欧洲的主导经济体系。这个体系是由"国家"驱动的，所以是国家设定价格, 并决定生产计划(相当于中国的"计划经济")。但在1776年，#亚当·斯密#（Adam Smith）出版了《国富论》*（The Wealth of Nations），在这本书中，*##他批评了重商主义，并主张建立一个不受监管的市场，这个市场将由"供求关系"来调节。##需要明确的是，"重商主义"的结束和"市场经济"的开始, 并没有一条明确的界限，但在这个时期，我们正处于这个模糊的过渡阶段。*  +

无论如何，**市场经济的增长, 导致了新的"金融实践"和"机构"的出现，**我要告诉你其中的两个。

- 首先是**"保险业"的引入**。如果发生像火灾摧毁工厂这样的灾难性事件，保险公司会收取每月的保费，并弥补企业家的损失。**有了这种保障，企业家，尤其是英国的企业家，有信心将大量资金投入到工厂和不断增加的待售商品库存中**。
- **其次是"银行和风险资本"的兴起。**在1750年之前，如果你是一名企业家，想要建造一个工厂，例如，你必须向家人借钱或者自己拥有财富。但随着商业的蓬勃发展和工厂制度的兴起，专业银行出现了，它们只保留人们存入的一部分钱，然后将其余的钱作为"风险资本"贷出，并收取利息。  +

**所以随着市场经济的发展，欧洲为其在全球(经济与政治势力方面)不断扩大的角色, 奠定了基础，**关于这一点, 我们会在另一个视频中详细讲述。好的，我的第三单元的其他视频就在这里，所以伸出你的手指点击吧。另外，如果你想在课堂上得A，在考试中得5分，那就获取我为这些视频准备的笔记指南吧。感谢你的关注，我们下次再见。我是劳伦特，下线了。  +
