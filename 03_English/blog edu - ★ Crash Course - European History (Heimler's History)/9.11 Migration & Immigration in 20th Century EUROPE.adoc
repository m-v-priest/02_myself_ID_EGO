== 释义

So in the 1950s and the 1960s, the European population was getting older 变老, and the birth rate 出生率 was declining, and yet the overall population of Europe was increasing significantly. "I don't understand how that's possible." Well, me from that side of the screen, that's because you're not considering the metric buttloads of migrants 移民 that entered Europe during that period, and that's what this video is all about. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So as you _no doubt_ 毫无疑问 know by now 所以你现在肯定知道了, `主` Western Europe's economic recovery 经济复苏 after World War II `系` was pretty staggering 大得惊人的，令人吃惊的,令人震惊的. As I mentioned in another video, it was dubbed (v.)被称为;把…戏称为；给…起绰号 an economic miracle 经济奇迹, with the economy booming 繁荣；兴旺. Tons 吨；大量；许多 of new jobs were opening 机会，机遇；空缺的职位；开放，开业, and there were not enough Europeans to fill them. Now in the video on second-wave feminism, I also mentioned that /women began filling some of those jobs, but `主` even that `系` wasn't enough to fulfill 满足；实现 the demand. +




So beginning in the 1950s and 60s, because of this labor shortage 劳动力短缺, European countries began *relying on* what they called _guest workers_ 客工,外籍劳工 to help fill (v.) all the jobs -- and guest workers is just another term for immigrants. Now with the worldwide movement of decolonization 去殖民化 that was occurring during this period, many people from former colonies 前殖民地 began moving to their former imperial parents' country for work. So what I mean is Indians came to work (v.) in Britain, North Africans came to France, etc. But not only that, Europeans *migrated (v.)迁移；移居 to* other European states for work (v.) as well. For example, `主` Southern Europeans of various stripes 条纹；线条 `谓` came *to find work* in Germany. +

.案例
====
.Southern Europeans of various stripes `谓` came to find work in Germany.
"stripe"​​ 原意是“条纹”，但在此处为​​比喻用法​​，引申为 ​​“类型”​​ 或 ​​“背景”​​（类似中文的“花色”或“门类”）。 +
"of various stripes"​​ = ​​“各式各样的”​​（of various kinds/types），强调多样性。

When I say `主` _a metric buttload of_ immigrants `谓` came to work in Europe, I mean a metric buttload. By the 1980s, they constituted 构成；组成 about five percent of the European population. You know, when these immigrants came, they weren't just cogs (n.)齿轮；无足轻重的人 in Europe's industrial machines. They brought (v.) their culture with them, and maybe _more to the point_ 更重要的是, they brought their religion with them. `主` The most prolific 丰富的；多产的 growth (n.) in religion 宗教信仰；宗教 during this period `谓` came from Muslim immigrants 后定说明 practicing (v.) Islam 伊斯兰教 in their new homes, and `主` that huge influx 涌入；流入 of Muslims `谓` *led to* debate (n.) about _the proper role_ of religion in the public sphere 公共领域. +

[.my2]
当我说有大量移民来到欧洲工作时，我指的是“大量”这个程度。到了 20 世纪 80 年代，他们约占欧洲人口的 5%。要知道，这些移民并非只是欧洲工业机器中的普通零件。他们还带来了自己的文化，更重要的是，他们还带来了自己的宗教信仰。在这一时期，宗教方面最显著的增长, 来自在新居地信奉伊斯兰教的穆斯林移民，而大量涌入的穆斯林人群, 引发了关于宗教在公共领域中应扮演何种角色的讨论。

But for that debate, let's talk about resistance (n.)抵制；反抗 to immigrants. Now since Europe had always been historically Christian, `主` _the steady (a.)平稳的，稳步的，持续的 growth_ of Islam as a minority religion 少数派宗教 `系` became unwelcome in certain places. For example, in some countries, Muslims were given free access *to run (v.) for* 竞选；谋求（职位等）office 竞选公职, but others erected (v.)建立；竖立 significant barriers 障碍；栅栏；篱笆墙. Additionally, some Europeans believed that /where the practice of Islam *clashes (v.)与……冲突  with* 与……冲突 European laws, then `主` the religious practices `谓` ought *to bend (v.)  to* 屈服于；顺从 the law. This was especially true /when it *comes to* _traditional head coverings_ 传统头巾 for girls in school. +

[.my2]
但先不谈那场关于移民问题的辩论，咱们来谈谈对移民的抵制现象。由于欧洲自古以来就是基督教地区，伊斯兰教作为少数宗教的持续增长, 在某些地方变得不受欢迎。例如，在一些国家，穆斯林可以自由竞选公职，但在其他地方则设置了重重障碍。此外，一些欧洲人认为，当伊斯兰教的宗教实践与欧洲法律发生冲突时，宗教实践应当服从法律。这一点在涉及学校女生的传统头巾佩戴问题时尤为明显。

Now if you've been with me throughout Unit 9, you'll *remember* -- hopefully -- that during the 1970s, *that* `主` European economic miracle `谓` turned into kind of an economic recession 经济衰退. And so /during that decade, when the number of available jobs was declining, some groups *turned to* anti-immigrant rhetoric 反移民言论 and policies as an explanation for their woes 苦恼，痛苦;困境；灾难.  +
For example, in France, the National Front 国民阵线 attempted *to cut off* 切断；中断 all immigration /and restrict (v.) current immigrants from assimilating (v.)（使）同化;透彻理解；消化；吸收 to 融入 French society. You know, `主` National Front candidates 候选人；申请者 `谓` never really made it into power, but they did get a sizable 相当大的 amount of votes, and `主` that kind of success `谓` led (v.) other conservative parties to adopt (v.) their anti-immigrant proposals. +

如果在第九单元的学习过程中, 您一直与我保持同步的话，那么您应该还记得（希望您还记得吧）——在 20 世纪 70 年代，那个欧洲经济奇迹, 最终演变成了某种经济衰退。因此，在那十年间，由于可用工作岗位数量的减少，一些群体便转而采用反移民的言论和政策, 来解释他们所面临的困境。 +
例如，在法国，国民阵线试图全面禁止移民，并限制现有移民融入法国社会。要知道，国民阵线的候选人从未真正掌权，但他们确实获得了相当多的选票，这种成功促使其他保守党派也采纳了他们的反移民主张。

A similar party in Austria, known as the Freedom Party 自由党, was more successful in attempting to get candidates elected (v.) /but still lost.  +

The point is, `主` something like _15 million new immigrants_ `谓` entered (v.) Europe /_over the course 经过一段时间 of_ the second half of the 20th century, and in doing so /have begun to fundamentally 根本地 change (v.) the fabric 结构；构造 of European society and economics. +

[.my2]
在奥地利也有一支类似的政党，名为“自由党”。该党在争取候选人当选方面更为成功，但最终还是落败了。 +
关键在于，在 20 世纪后半叶，约有 1500 万新移民进入欧洲，这一过程从根本上改变了欧洲社会和经济的结构。

== 中文释义

*在20世纪50年代和60年代，欧洲人口逐渐老龄化，出生率不断下降，然而欧洲的总人口却在显著增加。*“我不明白这怎么可能。” 屏幕这边的我告诉你，那是因为你没有考虑到**这一时期大量涌入欧洲的移民，**而这就是这个视频要讲的内容。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

毫无疑问，你现在知道，第二次世界大战后**西欧的经济复苏相当惊人。**正如我在另一个视频中提到的，它被称为 “经济奇迹”，经济蓬勃发展。大量新的工作岗位涌现，**却没有足够的欧洲人来填补这些岗位。**在关于第二次女权运动的视频中，我也提到女性开始填补其中一些岗位，但即便如此，仍不足以满足需求。 +

所以从20世纪50年代和60年代开始，**由于劳动力短缺，欧洲国家开始依赖他们所谓的 “客工” 来填补所有这些工作岗位 —— “客工” 其实就是移民的另一种说法。在这一时期，随着全球去殖民化运动的开展，许多来自前殖民地的人开始前往他们以前的宗主国工作。**我的意思是，**印度人前往英国工作，北非人前往法国工作，**等等。但不仅如此，欧洲人也前往其他欧洲国家工作。例如，不同地区的南欧人前往德国找工作。 +

当我说**大量移民**来到欧洲工作时，真的是数量庞大。到20世纪80年代，**他们占到了欧洲人口的大约5%。**你知道，这些移民到来后，他们不仅仅是欧洲工业机器上的齿轮。他们带来了自己的文化，更重要的是，**他们带来了自己的宗教。**这一时期，宗教的显著增长来自于在新家信奉**伊斯兰教**的穆斯林移民 (*#历史上欧洲把"伊斯兰教"赶出去, 现在又通过移民带回来了#*)，大量穆斯林的涌入引发了关于宗教在公共领域应扮演何种适当角色的争论。 +

但关于这场争论，我们来谈谈对移民的抵制。从历史上看，欧洲一直以基督教为主，作为少数派宗教的伊斯兰教的稳步发展, 在某些地方并不受欢迎。例如，**##在一些国家，穆斯林被赋予了竞选公职的自由权利，##但在其他国家，却设置了重大障碍。**此外，*##一些欧洲人认为，当伊斯兰教的实践, 与欧洲法律发生冲突时，宗教实践应该服从法律。##当涉及到女孩在学校佩戴传统头巾的问题时，这种情况尤为明显。* +

如果你一直跟着我学习第9单元的内容，你应该还记得 —— 希望你记得 —— **在20世纪70年代，欧洲的 “经济奇迹” 变成了一场经济衰退。所以在那个十年里，当可提供的工作岗位数量下降时，一些团体开始**用**反移民**的言论和政策, 来解释他们的困境。例如，**在法国，国民阵线（the National Front）试图切断所有移民途径(需要劳动力时, 想要移民. 经济差时, 敌视移民来抢工作. 只可同患难, 不可同富贵)，并限制现有移民融入法国社会。**你知道，"国民阵线"的候选人从未真正掌权，但他们确实获得了相当数量的选票，这种成功促使其他保守党采纳了他们的反移民提案。 +

奥地利有一个类似的政党，即自由党（the Freedom Party），他们在试图让候选人当选方面更为成功，但最终还是失败了。关键是，*在20世纪后半叶，大约1500万新移民进入了欧洲，他们的到来开始从根本上改变欧洲社会和经济的结构。* +

So as you no doubt know by now, Western Europe's economic recovery after World War II was pretty staggering. As I mentioned in another video, it was dubbed an economic miracle, with the economy booming. Tons of new jobs were opening, and there were not enough Europeans to fill them. Now in the video on second-wave feminism, I also mentioned that women began filling some of those jobs, but even that wasn't enough to fulfill the demand.

So beginning in the 1950s and 60s, because of this labor shortage, European countries began relying on what they called guest workers to help fill all the jobs -- and guest workers is just another term for immigrants.

When I say a metric buttload of immigrants came to work in Europe, I mean a metric buttload. By the 1980s, they constituted about five percent of the European population. You know, when these immigrants came, they weren't just cogs in Europe's industrial machines. They brought their culture with them, and maybe more to the point, they brought their religion with them. The most prolific growth in religion during this period came from Muslim immigrants practicing Islam in their new homes, and that huge influx of Muslims led to debate about the proper role of religion in the public sphere.

But for that debate, let's talk about resistance to immigrants. Now since Europe had always been historically Christian, the steady growth of Islam as a minority religion became unwelcome in certain places. For example, in some countries, Muslims were given free access to run for office, but others erected significant barriers. Additionally, some Europeans believed that where the practice of Islam clashes with European laws, then the religious practices ought to bend to the law. This was especially true when it comes to traditional head coverings for girls in school.

Now if you've been with me throughout Unit 9, you'll remember -- hopefully -- that during the 1970s, that European economic miracle turned into kind of an economic recession. And so during that decade, when the number of available jobs was declining, some groups turned to anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies as an explanation for their woes. For example, in France, the National Front attempted to cut off all immigration and restrict current immigrants from assimilating to French society.
