== 释义

So the French Revolution was, to put it mildly 委婉地说, uh, chaotic 混乱的 for France. So after the smoking (a.) _cultural and social rubble 废墟 of the revolution_ settled, a new leader *would come to power* 掌权 by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte. And he was kind of a dictator 独裁者. So it would seem that `主` all the gains 成果 of the revolution and all the equality 平等 that they fought for `系` was for nothing. But that is not quite true. So if you're ready to get that brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now, not only was the revolution concerned 有关，关于；涉及 *to enact (v.)颁布；实施 the liberal 自由的 reforms* 改革 后定 demanded by the revolutionaries 革命者, you have to remember that /this was a revolution about _how France would become a nation_ -- like how it would *hold together* socially, politically, and economically 如何在社会、政治和经济上团结在一起.  +
And so in the throes 剧痛；挣扎 of _the Reign of Terror_ 恐怖统治 and _the new calendar_ 日历 and _the complete removal_ 移除 of ancient cultural institutions 机构 like the Catholic Church 天主教会, `主` the people of France `谓` felt (v.) chaotic (a.)混乱的，无秩序的 and unstable 不稳定的 /and *yearned (v.) for* 渴望 a return to stability 稳定. +

[.my2]
现在，这场革命不仅涉及实施革命者所要求的自由主义改革，你必须记住，这场革命是关于法国如何成为一个国家的革命，比如它如何在社会，政治和经济上团结在一起。因此，在恐怖统治和新历法的阵痛中，在天主教会等古老文化机构被完全移除的情况下，法国人民感到混乱和不稳定，渴望回归稳定。

And good news for them, because here comes Napoleon Bonaparte. +

Now, Napoleon *rose to* the rank of 升到…军衔 general 将军 in 1794 /and won a glowing 光辉的；卓越的 reputation 声誉 during the revolution for his leadership 领导 of the French army in Italy. He was *so* successful *that* the French Directory (指导的，咨询的) 督政府 sent him to fight (v.) the British in Egypt. Now, in those campaigns 战役, Napoleon pretty squarely 明确地;直接了当；明确无误；毫不含糊地 failed. But before _news of those failures_ reached the home front 后方, he returned to France /and led a coup 政变 to overthrow (v.)推翻 the Directory /and put himself into leadership. +

And in doing so, he established a three-member consulate (领事馆；领事职位) 执政府 and was named _First Consul_ 第一执政, which in effect 实际上 meant (v.) that /he ruled France without rival 对手. A new constitution 宪法 was drafted 起草 to solidify (v.)巩固 these changes /and was adopted 采纳 in 1799. +

Well, at first, among three was apparently not enough for Napoleon. In 1804, he crowned 加冕 himself _Emperor  皇帝 Napoleon the First_ 拿破仑一世. But *hold on* 等待 just a hot minute 请稍等片刻 -- if memory serves (v.)记忆没错的话, during the radical 激进的 phase 阶段 of the French Revolution, they *went ahead* and cut off Louis XVI's head /because he was judged (v.)裁决；审理 a tyrannical 专制的；暴虐的 ruler, and they declared France a republic 共和国 -- the consent of the government 政府的同意 and all that Enlightenment 启蒙运动 stuff. +

So why are the French people *not only* not rebelling (v.) against 反抗 Napoleon *but* actively embracing (v.)拥护 his rise to power as a dictator? Well, remember what I said just a moment ago -- `主` long-standing 长期存在的 French social and cultural institutions `谓` had been abolished 废除, and that was very destabilizing 使不稳定的 for the French people.
And so especially after the violent bloodletting 流血冲突 of the Reign of Terror, people longed (v.)渴望，很想 to return to some sense of normalcy 常态. And Napoleon promised to do so because, according to his own reckoning 据他自己估计, he embodied 体现；代表 the principles 原则 of the revolution. +

So you get everything you fought for in the revolution, and you get a strong ruler who can bring back order 恢复秩序 to the nation. Uh, yes please. +

But let's see just how much Napoleon embodied the revolution in his role. And for that, let's *focus on* his domestic 国内的 reforms. +

First, he instituted 制定；实行 the Napoleonic Code 拿破仑法典, which reasserted (v.)重申;重新断言，再次声明 three key principles of the revolution.  +
First, the equality of all citizens before the law 法律面前人人平等. And by all citizens, Napoleon meant (v.) all citizens with XY chromosomes 染色体 -- you know, women not so much.  +
Second, _the Napoleonic Code_ issued (v.) protections for wealth and private property 私有财产.  +
And third, it *introduced* (v.) a degree of _religious toleration_ 宗教宽容 *to* France. +

Napoleon's second domestic reform 对内改革 was the centralizing 集权化 of the government and the bureaucracy 官僚机构. Napoleon *consolidated (v.)巩固 power* by creating a bureaucracy that would implement (v.)执行 the tenets 原则；信条；教义 of the Napoleonic Code. *Instead of* reserving (v.) those positions for those _who had the right ancestry_ 血统 or _who had inherited (v.)继承 them_, Napoleon awarded (v.) those offices *on the basis of* 根据，按照 merit 功绩；才能 -- which is to say, the most qualified 有资格的；能胜任的 person would receive (v.) the bureaucratic job. +

And the third domestic reform to know `系` is the religious reform that came in the Concordat of Bologna 博洛尼亚教务专约 in 1801. *Remember that* in the revolution, Church lands were confiscated (v.)没收；充公 _in the name of_ 以……的名义 the state, and Catholicism 天主教 was one of the chief 主要的 enemies of the new order 新秩序. *Remember that* under the leadership of _Maximilien Robespierre_ 罗伯斯庇尔, Catholicism was basically abolished (v.) in favor of 支持；赞同 a French secular 世俗的 state. +

[.my1]
.案例

.confiscate
-> con-, 强调。#-fisc, 篮子，钱篓#，词源同 basket,fiscal.
====

But Napoleon rectified (v.)纠正 some of this lingering (a.)持续的,拖延的，迟迟不结束的 animosity 敌意,憎恶，仇恨 in _the Concordat 协定；宗派间的协约 of 1801_, which *asserted 宣称 that* French Catholics could worship (v.)礼拜；敬神 freely. However, Napoleon *retained (v.)保留 the right* to nominate (v.)提名 and pay (v.) bishops 主教 and priests 神父, so the Church was still subservient (a.) to 屈从于；服从于 the state. +

Now, Napoleon claimed that /his main goal was to extend (v.)扩展 and promote (v.)推广 the principles of the revolution -- liberty, equality, and fraternity 博爱. And certainly he made some progress on that front 方面 with his domestic reforms. But in order to maintain (v.) his power, he also diminished (v.)削弱 the rights of the people. +

The first way he did so `系` was through his use of a secret police 秘密警察. Under the leadership of _the minister （英国及其他许多国家的）部长，大臣 of police_ 警察部长, Joseph Fouché, Napoleon's secret police worked (v.) tirelessly 不知疲倦地 *to sniff (v.)嗅 out* 发现；查出 conspiracies 阴谋 and any plot 密谋 to threaten (v.) the established order 既定秩序. And the secret police were everywhere, sometimes executing (v.)处决 innocent people *in order* to send a message to other would-be (a.)（形容想要成为…的人）未来的 conspirators 潜在的阴谋者. +

#The second way# 后定说明 Napoleon diminished (v.) the rights of the people `系` #was# through censorship 审查制度. `主` The freedom of the press 新闻自由 gained (v.) during the revolution `谓` was summarily 迅速地；即刻地 curtailed (v.)限制；缩短；减缩;削减 under Napoleon's rule.  +
*The more* criticism was leveled (v.)瞄准，对准 at 针对…提出批评 Napoleon's actions, *the more* he sought to remove (v.) that freedom. And he did this by installing 安置 state-sponsored 赞助（活动、节目等） censors 国家支持的审查员 in the staff 全体员工，全体雇员 of every major French newspaper. +

And `主` the third way Napoleon diminished the rights of the people `系` was his marginalization (n.)边缘化 of women. Women lost (v.) many of the rights they had gained (v.) during the revolution. They *were reduced to* the status 法律地位（或身份）；（尤指在社会中的）地位，身份  of dependence (n.) on 依赖 their husbands and fathers. And under _the Napoleonic Code_, women could no longer *enter (v.) into contracts* 签订合同 or *hold (v.) property* 拥有财产 后定说明 apart from 与…分离,无关 their husbands. +

[.my1]

.women could no longer enter into contracts or hold property _apart from their husbands_.
"apart from"​​ 在这里表示 ​​“与…分离/无关”​​，强调女性在法律上无法拥有 ​​独立于丈夫​​ 的财产权或契约权。 +
直译：“女性不能再签订契约或持有财产——如果这些权利与她们的丈夫无关（即独立行使）。” （女性权利）不能脱离丈夫单独存在.
====



Okay, now *no* _discussion of Napoleon would be complete_ /without talking about how he basically conquered (v.)征服 the whole dang （非正式，用于强调） European continent in the Napoleonic Wars 拿破仑战争. +

[.my2]
关于拿破仑的讨论，如果不谈到他是如何在拿破仑战争中征服了整个欧洲大陆的话，那就不完整了。

In *waging (v.)始，发动，进行，继续（战争、战斗等） these wars*, Napoleon's stated (a.)正式表明的 aim 宣称的目标 `系` was *to spread* the ideals 理想 of the revolution *throughout* Europe. But _it was kind of hard_ to tell `宾`  if that was the reason 后定说明 Napoleon went to war /or if he just wanted to rule (v.) all of Europe. +

====

So by 1806, Napoleon had won (v.) wars of conquest 征服战争 against Austria, Prussia, and Russia, and the map of Europe began to change (v.) significantly 显著地. By 1810, Napoleon had expanded even further, so that he began *to see* himself *not as* the emperor of France *but as* the emperor of Europe. +

As he went out conquering 出去征服, *it's true that* he did spread the ideals of the revolution into these various lands. Church lands *were transferred (v.) to* 转移到 peasants 农民, and slavery 奴隶制 was abolished, and the inherited (a.) privileges 世袭特权 of the aristocracy 贵族,贵族阶级 were stripped (v.)剥夺. So he wasn't lying (v.)说谎 when he said that /he wanted *to spread* the ideals of the revolution *to* all of Europe. +

Okay, now the question is, how did Napoleon administer (v.)管理，治理 this vast 庞大的 empire 帝国? He did it *through* direct and indirect means 方式. So his empire could basically *be broken down* into 分解为 three parts. +

_The first part_ here *was known as* 被称为 the Grand Empire 大帝国, and it *centered on* 以…为中心 France and the lands 后定说明 that Napoleon had conquered around France /and were under his direct control 直接控制. +

The second part of the empire `谓` included technically _independent kingdoms_ whom Napoleon kept (v.) faithful to 使…忠于 him /by *installing*   安装；（使）就任；安顿（某人） members of his family *on* their thrones 王位. +

[.my2]
帝国的第二部分, 包括一些在技术上保持独立的王国，拿破仑通过让自己的家族成员登上这些王国的王位，来确保它们对他保持忠诚。

And the third part `谓` included those nations that *were allied with* 与…结盟 France, including Austria, Prussia, and Russia. +

The one place Napoleon couldn't seem to conquer `系`  was Great Britain. So he used (v.) his influence on the European continent /to establish the Continental System 大陆封锁体系, which *amounted to* 相当于 a blockade 封锁 of British shipping 航运. *It mandated (v.)命令;强制执行；委托办理 that* British ships could not dock (v.)（使船）靠码头，进港 at 停靠 any port 港口  后定说明 controlled by the French. And you know, that was, you know, basically all of them. +

Now, Napoleon couldn't conquer (v.) every dang thing in Europe /without *stirring 搅拌；激发 up* 激起 some consequences 后果. So let's talk about that. +

First, nationalistic 民族主义的 responses *arose to* Napoleon's dominance 统治. And nationalism 民族主义, in case you don't know, is a strong identification 鉴定；辨认;确认；确定 with 认同 one's own people and one's own cultural heritage 文化遗产. And when a foreigner invades (v.)入侵, it usually has the effect of *stirring up* national sentiments (（基于情感的）观点，看法；情绪) 民族情绪, as it did _first of all_ in Spain 就像最初在西班牙发生的那样. +

In 1808, Napoleon *led a campaign* 军事行动 to make Spain a satellite state 卫星国 of France. And in response, a group of Catholics and Spanish patriots 爱国者 resisted (v.)抵抗 the invasion of the French army. After the French occupied 占领 the capital city, these patriots *fled to* the hills where they *waged (v.)进行 brutal 残酷的 guerrilla (n.)游击队员;游击战；游击队 warfare* 游击战 against the French -- a clear indication 迹象 that French imperialism 帝国主义 was unwelcome 不受欢迎的. +

Now, in 1812, Napoleon *turned (v.) his sights on* 把目光投向 Russia, claiming that /he wanted *to free* (v.) Poland *from* Russian dominance 优势，支配地位. He invaded (v.) Russia with an army of something like 600,000 soldiers. The Russians were smart 聪明的，明智的, though. All they did `系` was keep (v.) retreating 撤退 back into Russia /and thus very rarely  (ad.)罕有，很少 came into _pitched 用力扔；投；抛 battle_ 激战 with Napoleon's troops 军队. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.pitched battle
在军事语境中，"pitched battle" 指的是一场精心策划、双方军队都准备充分，并选择在特定地点和时间进行的大规模正面对决。
====

And as they retreated, they followed a scorched-earth (a.)焦土政策的 policy 焦土政策, which means that they just burned everything in sight 视野内的一切, *which further meant that* 这进一步意味着 Napoleon's army was unable *to live off* 靠……生活;依赖，依靠 the land 靠土地为生. So seeing that /`主` pursuing (v.)追击 the Russians further `谓` would lead to disaster 灾难, he ordered a great retreat 大撤退. But it was too late. Russian winters are, to use the technical term, butt cold （非正式，非常寒冷）. +

== 中文释义


可以说，**法国大革命对法国而言，呃，是混乱的。所以在这场革命带来的文化和社会动荡尘埃落定之后，一位名叫拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoleon Bonaparte）的新领袖掌权了。而且他有点像个独裁者。**所以看起来这场革命所取得的所有成果，以及革命者为之奋斗的平等，都白费了。但事实并非完全如此。所以如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

现在，这场革命不仅致力于实施革命者所要求的自由改革，你还得记住，这是一场关于法国如何成为一个国家的革命——比如它如何在社会、政治和经济上团结起来。所以在恐怖统治的动荡时期，在新历法实施, 以及像天主教会这样的古老文化机构被彻底清除的情况下，法国人民感到混乱和不安，渴望恢复稳定。  +

对他们来说，好消息是拿破仑·波拿巴出现了。  +

拿破仑在1794年晋升为将军，并在革命期间因在意大利领导法国军队, 而声名远扬。他非常成功，*督政府（French Directory）派他去埃及与英国作战。在那些战役中，拿破仑相当失败。但在这些失败的消息传回国内之前，#他回到了法国，并领导了一场政变，推翻了"督政府"，自己掌握了政权。#*  +

通过这样做，*他建立了一个由三人组成的执政府，自己被任命为"第一执政"，这实际上意味着他统治法国，没有对手。一部"新宪法"被起草出来，巩固了这些变革，并于1799年被通过。*  +

嗯，一开始，*对拿破仑来说，三人执政显然不够。1804年，他加冕自己为拿破仑一世*（Emperor Napoleon the First）。但是等一下——如果没记错的话，在"法国大革命"的激进阶段，他们处决了路易十六（Louis XVI），因为他被判定为暴君，并且他们宣布法国成为一个"共和国"——遵循政府的同意, 以及所有那些启蒙思想的理念。  +

那么为什么法国人民不仅不反抗拿破仑，反而积极接受他成为"独裁者"呢？嗯，还记得我刚才说的吗——法国长期存在的社会和文化机构被废除，这对法国人民来说非常不稳定。所以特别是在恐怖统治的血腥杀戮之后，人们渴望恢复某种正常状态。而拿破仑承诺会这样做，因为据他自己的说法，他体现了革命的原则。  +

所以你得到了在革命中为之奋斗的一切，并且你有了一个强大的统治者，他能让国家恢复秩序。呃，是的，求之不得。  +

但让我们看看拿破仑在他的统治中, 在多大程度上体现了革命。为此，让我们关注他的国内改革。  +

首先，*他制定了《拿破仑法典》（Napoleonic Code），重申了革命的三个关键原则。第一，#所有公民在法律面前平等。而这里的所有公民，拿破仑指的是所有拥有XY染色体的公民——你懂的，女性不算在内。第二，《拿破仑法典》对财富和私有财产提供了保护。第三，它在法国引入了一定程度的宗教宽容。#*  +

拿破仑的第二项国内改革, 是政府和官僚机构的集权化。**拿破仑通过建立一个能实施《拿破仑法典》原则的官僚机构, 来巩固权力。**他没有把这些职位, 留给那些有合适血统或者通过继承获得职位的人，而是根据功绩, 授予官职——也就是说，最有资格的人会得到官僚职位 (相当于中国在商鞅变法时做的改革, 用军功, 而非仅凭世袭贵族, 来获得官职)。  +

需要了解的第三项国内改革, 是1801年《教务专约》（Concordat of Bologna）中的宗教改革。还记得**在革命期间，教会土地被国家没收，**天主教是新秩序的主要敌人之一。还记得在马克西米连·*罗伯斯庇尔（Maximilien Robespierre）的领导下，天主教基本上被废除，支持建立一个法国世俗国家。*  +

**但拿破仑在1801年的《教务专约》中, **纠正了一些这种长期存在的敌意，该专约**宣称法国天主教徒可以自由礼拜。然而，拿破仑保留了提名和支付主教及牧师的权利，所以教会仍然服从于国家。**  +

现在，*#拿破仑声称他的主要目标, 是推广和弘扬革命的原则——自由、平等和博爱。而且他确实通过国内改革, 在这方面取得了一些进展。但为了维护自己的权力，他也削弱了人民的权利。#*  +

他这样做的第一个方式, 是通过使用秘密警察。在警察部长约瑟夫·富歇（Joseph Fouché）的领导下，*拿破仑的秘密警察, 不知疲倦地搜寻阴谋,和任何威胁既定秩序的密谋。秘密警察无处不在，有时为了向其他潜在的阴谋者传递信息，他们会处决无辜的人。*  +

**拿破仑削弱人民权利的第二个方式, 是##通过"审查制度"。革命期间获得的新闻自由, 在拿破仑的统治下被迅速削减。##**对拿破仑行为的批评越多，他就越想剥夺这种自由。*他通过在法国每一份主要报纸的工作人员中安插国家支持的审查员, 来达到这个目的。*  +

拿破仑削弱人民权利的第三个方式, 是**他对女性的边缘化。#女性失去了她们在革命期间获得的许多权利。#**她们沦为依赖丈夫和父亲的地位。*根据《拿破仑法典》，女性不能再签订合同, 或拥有与丈夫分开的财产。*  +

好的，现在如果不谈论拿破仑在拿破仑战争（Napoleonic Wars）中基本上征服了整个欧洲大陆这件事，对拿破仑的讨论就不完整。  +

*在发动这些战争时##，拿破仑宣称的目标, 是将革命的理想传播到整个欧洲。但很难说这是不是拿破仑开战的原因，或者他只是想统治整个欧洲。##*  +

所以到1806年，**拿破仑在与奥地利、普鲁士和俄罗斯的征服战争中, 取得了胜利，**欧洲地图开始发生重大变化。到1810年，*拿破仑进一步扩张，以至于他开始不把自己看作法国皇帝，而是欧洲皇帝。*  +

*#在他征服的过程中，确实他将革命的理想, 传播到了各个地区。教会土地, 被转让给农民，奴隶制被废除，贵族的世袭特权被剥夺#*。所以他说他想把革命的理想传播到整个欧洲，这并非谎言。  +

好的，*现在的问题是，拿破仑是如何管理这个庞大的帝国的？他通过直接和间接的方式来管理。所以他的帝国, 基本上可以分为三个部分。*  +

第一部分被称为大帝国（Grand Empire），以法国和拿破仑征服的法国周边, 并在他直接控制下的土地, 为中心。  +

*帝国的第二部分, 包括名义上独立的王国，拿破仑通过在这些王国的王位上安插自己的家族成员, 来让它们忠于自己。*  +

第三部分, 包括与法国结盟的国家，包括奥地利、普鲁士和俄罗斯。  +

**拿破仑似乎无法征服的一个地方是英国。**所以他利用他在欧洲大陆的影响力, 建立了大陆封锁体系（Continental System），这**相当于对英国航运的封锁。它规定英国船只不能停靠在任何法国控制的港口。你知道，基本上所有港口都在法国控制之下。**  +

现在，拿破仑无法在不引发一些后果的情况下, 征服欧洲的每一个地方。所以让我们谈谈这些后果。  +

首先，*对拿破仑统治的"民族主义"反应出现了。如果你不知道，民族主义是对自己的民族和文化遗产的强烈认同。当一个外国人入侵时，通常会激起民族情绪，西班牙就是如此。*  +

1808年，拿破仑领导了一场战役，想让西班牙成为法国的卫星国。作为回应，一群天主教徒和西班牙爱国者, 抵抗法国军队的入侵。法国占领了首都后，这些爱国者逃到山区，对法国发动了残酷的游击战——这清楚地表明法国的帝国主义不受欢迎。  +

现在，1812年，**拿破仑将目光投向俄罗斯，声称他想把波兰从俄罗斯的统治下解放出来。**他率领一支约60万人的军队入侵俄罗斯。不过，*俄罗斯人很聪明。他们所做的就是不断向俄罗斯境内撤退，因此很少与拿破仑的军队进行激烈战斗 (犹如中国抗日, 用空间换时间)。*  +

*在他们撤退时，他们采取了焦土政策*，这意味着他们烧毁了能看到的一切，这进一步**意味着拿破仑的军队无法依靠当地资源生存。**所以当拿破仑意识到继续追击俄罗斯人会导致灾难时，他下令大规模撤退。但为时已晚。用专业术语来说，俄罗斯的冬天极其寒冷。  +

所以在与零下的气温, 和周围一片焦土作斗争后，拿破仑的军队从60万人锐减到只有大约4万人。  +

所以到1814年，拿破仑的力量被过度消耗。**在入侵俄罗斯遭受惨败后，他听说国内有人试图发动政变。结果，他在1814年退位，**被流放到地中海的厄尔巴岛（Elba）。  +

**1815年他逃脱了，回到法国，组建了一支军队，试图推翻他的继任者路易十八（Louis XVIII）。但其他国家联合起来对抗拿破仑，1815年他在滑铁卢战役（Battle of Waterloo）中被击败。**在那之后，他被流放到圣赫勒拿岛（Saint Helena），在那里度过了余生。  +

So the French Revolution was, to put it mildly, uh, chaotic for France. So after the smoking cultural and social rubble of the revolution settled, a new leader would come to power by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte. And he was kind of a dictator. So it would seem that all the gains of the revolution and all the equality that they fought for was for nothing. But that is not quite true. So if you're ready to get that brain cows milked, let's get to it.

Now, not only was the revolution concerned to enact the liberal reforms demanded by the revolutionaries, you have to remember that this was a revolution about how France would become a nation -- like how it would hold together socially, politically, and economically. And so in the throes of the Reign of Terror and the new calendar and the complete removal of ancient cultural institutions like the Catholic Church, the people of France felt chaotic and unstable and yearned for a return to stability.

And good news for them, because here comes Napoleon Bonaparte.

Now, Napoleon rose to the rank of general in 1794 and won a glowing reputation during the revolution for his leadership of the French army in Italy. He was so successful that the French Directory sent him to fight the British in Egypt. Now, in those campaigns, Napoleon pretty squarely failed. But before news of those failures reached the home front, he returned to France and led a coup to overthrow the Directory and put himself into leadership.

And in doing so, he established a three-member consulate and was named First Consul, which in effect meant that he ruled France without rival. A new constitution was drafted to solidify these changes and was adopted in 1799.

Well, at first, among three was apparently not enough for Napoleon. In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor Napoleon the First. But hold on just a hot minute -- if memory serves, during the radical phase of the French Revolution, they went ahead and cut off Louis XVI's head because he was judged a tyrannical ruler, and they declared France a republic -- the consent of the government and all that Enlightenment stuff.

So why are the French people not only not rebelling against Napoleon but actively embracing his rise to power as a dictator? Well, remember what I said just a moment ago -- long-standing French social and cultural institutions had been abolished, and that was very destabilizing for the French people. And so especially after the violent bloodletting of the Reign of Terror, people longed to return to some sense of normalcy. And Napoleon promised to do so because, according to his own reckoning, he embodied the principles of the revolution.

So you get everything you fought for in the revolution, and you get a strong ruler who can bring back order to the nation. Uh, yes please.

But let's see just how much Napoleon embodied the revolution in his role. And for that, let's focus on his domestic reforms.

First, he instituted the Napoleonic Code, which reasserted three key principles of the revolution. First, the equality of all citizens before the law. And by all citizens, Napoleon meant all citizens with XY chromosomes -- you know, women not so much. Second, the Napoleonic Code issued protections for wealth and private property. And third, it introduced a degree of religious toleration to France.

Napoleon's second domestic reform was the centralizing of the government and the bureaucracy. Napoleon consolidated power by creating a bureaucracy that would implement the tenets of the Napoleonic Code. Instead of reserving those positions for those who had the right ancestry or who had inherited them, Napoleon awarded those offices on the basis of merit -- which is to say, the most qualified person would receive the bureaucratic job.

And the third domestic reform to know is the religious reform that came in the Concordat of Bologna in 1801. Remember that in the revolution, Church lands were confiscated in the name of the state, and Catholicism was one of the chief enemies of the new order. Remember that under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre, Catholicism was basically abolished in favor of a French secular state.

But Napoleon rectified some of this lingering animosity in the Concordat of 1801, which asserted that French Catholics could worship freely. However, Napoleon retained the right to nominate and pay bishops and priests, so the Church was still subservient to the state.

Now, Napoleon claimed that his main goal was to extend and promote the principles of the revolution -- liberty, equality, and fraternity. And certainly he made some progress on that front with his domestic reforms. But in order to maintain his power, he also diminished the rights of the people.

The first way he did so was through his use of a secret police. Under the leadership of the minister of police, Joseph Fouché, Napoleon's secret police worked tirelessly to sniff out conspiracies and any plot to threaten the established order. And the secret police were everywhere, sometimes executing innocent people in order to send a message to other would-be conspirators.

The second way Napoleon diminished the rights of the people was through censorship. The freedom of the press gained during the revolution was summarily curtailed under Napoleon's rule. The more criticism was leveled at Napoleon's actions, the more he sought to remove that freedom. And he did this by installing state-sponsored censors in the staff of every major French newspaper.

And the third way Napoleon diminished the rights of the people was his marginalization of women. Women lost many of the rights they had gained during the revolution. They were reduced to the status of dependence on their husbands and fathers. And under the Napoleonic Code, women could no longer enter into contracts or hold property apart from their husbands.

Okay, now no discussion of Napoleon would be complete without talking about how he basically conquered the whole dang European continent in the Napoleonic Wars.

In waging these wars, Napoleon's stated aim was to spread the ideals of the revolution throughout Europe. But it was kind of hard to tell if that was the reason Napoleon went to war or if he just wanted to rule all of Europe.

So by 1806, Napoleon had won wars of conquest against Austria, Prussia, and Russia, and the map of Europe began to change significantly. By 1810, Napoleon had expanded even further, so that he began to see himself not as the emperor of France but as the emperor of Europe.

As he went out conquering, it's true that he did spread the ideals of the revolution into these various lands. Church lands were transferred to peasants, and slavery was abolished, and the inherited privileges of the aristocracy were stripped. So he wasn't lying when he said that he wanted to spread the ideals of the revolution to all of Europe.

Okay, now the question is, how did Napoleon administer this vast empire? He did it through direct and indirect means. So his empire could basically be broken down into three parts.

The first part here was known as the Grand Empire, and it centered on France and the lands that Napoleon had conquered around France and were under his direct control.

The second part of the empire included technically independent kingdoms whom Napoleon kept faithful to him by installing members of his family on their thrones.

And the third part included those nations that were allied with France, including Austria, Prussia, and Russia.

The one place Napoleon couldn't seem to conquer was Great Britain. So he used his influence on the European continent to establish the Continental System, which amounted to a blockade of British shipping. It mandated that British ships could not dock at any port controlled by the French. And you know, that was, you know, basically all of them.

Now, Napoleon couldn't conquer every dang thing in Europe without stirring up some consequences. So let's talk about that.

First, nationalistic responses arose to Napoleon's dominance. And nationalism, in case you don't know, is a strong identification with one's own people and one's own cultural heritage. And when a foreigner invades, it usually has the effect of stirring up national sentiments, as it did first of all in Spain.

In 1808, Napoleon led a campaign to make Spain a satellite state of France. And in response, a group of Catholics and Spanish patriots resisted the invasion of the French army. After the French occupied the capital city, these patriots fled to the hills where they waged brutal guerrilla warfare against the French -- a clear indication that French imperialism was unwelcome.

Now, in 1812, Napoleon turned his sights on Russia, claiming that he wanted to free Poland from Russian dominance. He invaded Russia with an army of something like 600,000 soldiers. The Russians were smart, though. All they did was keep retreating back into Russia and thus very rarely came into pitched battle with Napoleon's troops.

And as they retreated, they followed a scorched-earth policy, which means that they just burned everything in sight, which further meant that Napoleon's army was unable to live off the land. So seeing that pursuing the Russians further would lead to disaster, he ordered a great retreat. But it was too late. Russian winters are, to use the technical term, butt cold.

And so contending with sub-zero temperatures and a bunch of scorched land all around, Napoleon's army returned with only about 40,000 men -- down from 600,000.

So by 1814, Napoleon was stretched too thin. After suffering a crushing defeat trying to invade Russia, he heard of an attempted coup back home. As a result, he ended up abdicating the throne in 1814 and was exiled to the Mediterranean island of Elba.

He escaped in 1815 and returned to France and raised an army and sought to dethrone his replacement, Louis XVIII. But other states united against Napoleon, and he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. And after that, he was exiled to Saint Helena, where he lived the rest of his days.
