== 释义

Oh hey, welcome to Unit 9 of AP Euro. So the Second World War is over, and a lot of Europe is not much more than (不比一堆冒烟的废墟多多少)不过是，仅仅只是，不超过 a smoking pile of rubble 瓦砾；碎石, which is to say `主` post-war Europe is firmly seated (v.)牢牢坐在...上,深陷...之中 on the struggle bus 陷入困境、举步维艰的状态(比喻像坐上一辆破旧巴士，颠簸难行，引申为“日子不好过”). So how are they going to rebuild everything /when they already spent all their dang money on destroying it? Well, that's what this video is about. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked Marshall Plan 马歇尔计划 style, then let's get to it. +

[.my2]
第二次世界大战已经结束，欧洲大部分地区只剩下一片熊熊燃烧的废墟，也就是说，战后的欧洲已经完全陷入了重建的艰难历程中。那么，当他们已经把所有的钱都花在破坏上之后，又该如何进行重建呢？接下来的这个视频就将解答这个问题。所以，如果你准备好以马歇尔计划的方式让他们“开动脑筋”进行重建工作，那我们就开始吧。

So before we talk about what the Marshall Plan was, let me give you some context 背景. After World War II was over, two global superpowers 超级大国 emerged from the wreckage 残货，残骸: the Soviet Union and the United States. And the conflict 冲突 between these two superpowers, known as the Cold War 冷战, will define global events /until the last part of the 20th century. Now we'll talk all about the Cold War in other videos, but for now /all you need to know is that /much of the conflict between these two powers *had to do with* 与……有关，与……有联系 their political and economic worldview 世界观.  +
The Soviet Union was organized as an authoritarian 独裁的；专制的 communist state 共产主义国家, while the United States was organized as a democratic capitalist state 民主资本主义国家. And each of these powers wanted to remake 重塑；改造 the entire world into the image *either* of communism (n.)共产主义 *or* democracy (n.)民主政体. +

And hey, if you got that National AP Euro exam *breathing (v.) down your neck* 紧逼；威胁 at this point, you might want to check out my AP Euro review pack, which has everything you need to study for and score a 5 on that exam. Link in description. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.breathing (v.) down your neck
*字面意思是 ​​“（某人）在你脖子后面呼吸”*​​，实际含义是：
​​*“某人或某事紧逼着你，让你感到压力、威胁或紧迫感”*​​，类似于中文的 ​​*“步步紧逼”​​、​​“如芒在背”​​ 或 ​​“催命似的”*​​。
====

Okay, so when World War II was finally at an end, the democratic states of Western Europe were, as I mentioned, in a bad way 处于糟糕的状态或情况. Their infrastructure 基础设施 had been destroyed by bombing, and their populations -- especially the male populations -- had been decimated 大批杀死；大幅削减;抽杀……十分之一的人；十中抽一 by the fight.  +
When states and populations are in real economic trouble, they might *be sorely (ad.)非常；极其;疼痛地；剧烈地 tempted* (v.)诱惑；引诱 to give communism a try. After all, under the dictates 命令；规定；指令 of a communist state -- at least in theory -- everyone would have enough food /and everyone would have gainful 有利益的；赚钱的 employment 有报酬的工作. But `主` the idea of _these Western democracies *falling to* the influence of communism_ `谓` stank (v.)有臭味；有难闻的气味 profoundly 极大地，深刻地；严重地，完全地 in the nostrils 鼻孔 of the United States. +

[.my2]
但若任由这些西方民主国家倒向共产主义的影响，美国可是​​一万个不乐意​​（字面直译：在美国的鼻孔里臭不可闻）。

[.my2]
当国家和民众面临严重的经济困境时，他们可能会非常渴望尝试一下共产主义。毕竟，在共产主义国家的统治下（至少在理论上是这样）——所有人都会有充足的食物，所有人都能获得有报酬的工作。但"这些西方民主国家会受到共产主义影响"的想法，在美国人心中却臭名昭著，令人深恶痛绝。

So `主` big daddy (爸爸)同类中最大；最重要的人；最重要的物 America `谓` decided to get involved in Western Europe's economic recovery. And _side note_ 旁注 -- if you're wondering why they didn't get involved in Eastern Europe's recovery, it's because much of Eastern Europe was already under the thumb (n.)拇指;控制；支配 and authority of the Soviet Union, and they did not want any of that _filthy (a.)十分肮脏的，污秽的;卑鄙的，不道德的 democratic money_. More on that /in another video. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.filth
->#来自 foul#, 恶臭的，污秽的。
====

Anyway, `主` the U.S. proposal 提议 to help (v.) in Western Europe's economic recovery `谓` became known as _the Marshall Plan_, which was implemented 实施；执行 in 1947. This plan *allocated* 分配；拨出 13 billion dollars in _economic aid_ (n.)经济援助 *to* Western nations /seeking (v.) to rebuild (v.). Just _in case_ `主` your knowledge of the 1947-1951 U.S. federal budget 联邦预算 `系` is a little shaky (a.)颤抖的,不牢靠的，不稳固的；不确定的, let me just tell you that /13 billion was about 10 percent of _the entire federal budget_ during those years. _In case_ you haven't fallen out of your chair 从椅子上摔下来 just yet 恰好现在, that is a lot. `主` 10% of _all U.S. spending_ 美国总支出 for those years `谓` *was sent to* Western European states for their recovery. +


[.my1]
.案例
====
.shaky
(a.)not firm or safe; not certain 不稳固的；不牢靠的；摇晃的；不确切的 +
•That ladder looks a little shaky.这梯子看来不大牢靠。 +
( figurative) +
•Her memories of the accident are *a little shaky*. 那次事故她记不太清楚了。 +
( figurative) +
•The protesters are *on shaky (a.) ground* (= it is not certain that their claims are valid) . 抗议者未必站得住脚。 +

And I emphasize 强调 that /because the first question you have to ask is: why would the United States *send* so much stinking money *to* countries /that are not themselves? Well, it's because there was a very real fear /that if communism began to spread (v.) throughout Western Europe, then communism would *take over* the whole world. So if it takes 13 billion dollars to stop communism, you betcha (= you bet (v.)打赌，赌博；<非正式>敢肯定 your ... 你尽管放心,绝对没错) sweet bippy <美，俚>屁股，臀部 /we're spending 13 billion.  所以，如果花130亿就能阻止共产主义，那特么必须砸这130亿啊！(若需130亿美元阻止共产主义，我们定会不惜代价投入。) +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.you betcha
**= "you bet your..."**的俚语缩略形式（美国中西部/北方方言），意思是 ​​*“你尽管放心”、“绝对没错”​​。*
类似中文的 ​​“这还用说！”​​、​​“必须的！”​​、​​“妥妥的！”​​。

"sweet"​​：
字面是“甜美的”，但在这里是​​加强语气的调侃词​​，类似中文说 ​​“你的宝贝（某物）”​​ 或 ​​“你可爱的（某物）”。

"bippy"​​：
这是一个​​无实际意义的虚构词​​，源自1960-70年代美国电视综艺《Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In》中的搞笑用语（类似中文网络梗“绝绝子”）。 +
它本身无含义，但作为 ​​"you bet your [body part]"​​ 的幽默替代（原句可能是 "you bet your ass"，但用 "bippy"更文明且搞笑）

*"you betcha sweet bippy"​​ = ​​“这还用问吗！绝对要干啊！”​*​ 或 ​​“豁出去了也得干！”​​ +
它传递的是一种 ​​“不惜一切代价、毫不犹豫”​​ 的决心，同时用滑稽的用词弱化严肃性，带点自嘲或调侃。

So the question now is: did it work? And the answer is: yeah, it worked phenomenally 现象上地；从感官认识到;极其；十分;惊人地；非凡地. So in that case 考虑到那个情况，因此, let's have a look at some of the effects of the Marshall Plan. +

The first effect was rapid (a.)快速的 economic recovery in Western Europe. `主` This massive influx 大量涌入 of American money `谓` helped Western European states quickly rebuild (v.) cities and roads and bridges, since 因为，由于 they now had the money to purchase (v.) the raw materials 原材料 that they needed. This _in turn_ 作为回应，作为回报 got the industrial sector 工业部门 humming (v.)嗡嗡作响,活跃；兴旺 again, and factories roared (v.)咆哮 back to life 重获新生,恢复生机 to produce (v.) the goods /needed for reconstruction 重建. In fact, it worked *so* well /*that* by 1950, `主` European industry _on the whole_ `谓` surpassed (v.)超过；超越 its pre-war output 战前产量. +

And perhaps `主` the _poster child_ 典型代表,代表性人物 of post-war recovery `系` was West Germany. And you're like: hold on Heimler 等等，海姆勒, what's West Germany? Well after the war, Germany was essentially split (v.)（使）分裂 into two halves, _with Western European states and the United States_ aiding (v.) the Western half 西欧国家和美国,援助西半部(西德), and the Soviet Union aiding (v.) the Eastern.  +
Anyway, as `主` funds from the Marshall Plan `谓` flooded (v.) into West Germany, `主` their recovery `系` was *so* profound 深刻的；深远的 /it was dubbed (v.)把…戏称为；给…起绰号;被称为 an economic miracle 经济奇迹.  +
By 1955, just _the Western half_ of Germany had increased (v.) its economic output *so* much /*that* it was larger than _all of Germany's output_ before the war. Now to be clear 现在澄清一下, `主` the economic miracle `谓` *applied to* 适用于 all of Western Europe, but it was especially pronounced (a.)明显的；显著的 in West Germany. +

[.my2]
无论如何，随着马歇尔计划的资金涌入西德，他们的复苏是如此深刻，以至于被称为经济奇迹。到1955年，仅德国西半部的经济产出就大幅增长，超过了战前德国的总产出。需要说明的是，经济奇迹适用于整个西欧，但在西德尤为明显。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.their recovery was *so* profound (*that*) it was dubbed an economic miracle. 他们的复苏**如此**显著，**以至于**它被称为经济奇迹。
原文中省略了一个 that.  在英语中，​​##**"so...that..."​​ 结构中的 ​​"that"​​ 在非正式语境或口语中​​经常被省略​​，尤其是当句子较短、意思明确时。**##例如： +
•​正式/书面​​：The movie was *so* scary ​​/*that​​* I couldn't sleep. +
•​口语/非正式​​：The movie was *so* scary /I couldn't sleep.（*省略that*）

类似的省略现象：​​ +
英语中许多连接词在口语中可省略，例如： +
•​​"I know (that) you're right."​​ +
•​​"He said (that) he would come."​​ +
•​​"It's so cold (that) my hands are numb."​​ +
====

The second effect was _the increased (a.) importance_ 日益增加的重要性 of consumerism 消费主义. Now `主` consumerism 消费主义, by definition, `系` is the idea /that the well-being 福祉；幸福 of a nation's economy *is dependent (a.)依赖的，依靠的；取决于 on* people buying consumer goods 消费品. And `主` those goods `谓` included (v.) things like _cars_ and _washing machines_ and _clothing_ and _**darn (ad.a.)非常（同 damn） near** 几乎,差不多 anything else_ you could think of. And _as a result of_ 由于，因为 people buying more and more manufactured (a.)制造的，已制成的 goods 制成品, wages 工资；报酬 began to rise (v.)  significantly /and the middle class 中产阶级 expanded. +

[.my2]
第二个影响是, 消费主义日益重要。

So _in terms of_ 就……而言 economic recovery in Western Europe, did the Marshall Plan work (v.)? And the answer is a resounding (a.)响亮的；强有力的;巨大的；令人瞩目的 uh-huh （表示同意、理解或给出肯定答案）嗯-哼. +


[.my1]
.案例

== 中文释义

哦，嘿，欢迎来到AP欧洲史的第9单元。第二次世界大战结束了，欧洲的很多地方成了一片废墟，也就是说，战后的欧洲深陷困境。既然他们把钱都花在战争破坏上了，那他们要怎么重建一切呢？嗯，这就是这个视频要讲的内容。所以，如果你准备好以“马歇尔计划”（Marshall Plan）的视角来获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

在我们谈论"马歇尔计划"是什么之前，我先给你们讲讲背景。第二次世界大战结束后，从战争废墟中崛起了两个全球超级大国：苏联（the Soviet Union）和美国（the United States）。这两个超级大国之间的冲突，也就是所谓的“冷战”（the Cold War），将影响着全球局势，这种影响一直持续到20世纪后期。我们会在其他视频里详细谈论冷战，但现在你们只需要知道，这两个大国之间的冲突, 很大程度上与它们的政治和经济世界观(即价值观, 意识形态)有关。苏联是一个专制的共产主义国家，而美国是一个民主的资本主义国家。这两个大国都想把整个世界改造成符合自己的样子，要么是共产主义模式，要么是民主模式。 +

嘿，如果全国AP欧洲史考试已经迫在眉睫，你可能想看看我的AP欧洲史复习资料包，它包含了你备考所需的一切，能让你在考试中得5分。简介里有链接。 +

好的，所以当**第二次世界大战最终结束时，**正如我提到的，**西欧的民主国家处境艰难。**它们的基础设施被轰炸破坏了，人口，尤其是男性人口，在战争中大量减少。**当国家和民众陷入严重的经济困境时，他们可能会非常想尝试共产主义。**毕竟，在共产主义国家的体制下，至少从理论上来说，每个人都能有足够的食物，每个人都能有一份有收入的工作。但这些西欧民主国家受到共产主义影响的想法，让美国非常反感(担忧)。 +

**所以美国这个“老大哥”决定参与西欧的经济复苏。**顺便说一下，如果你想知道**为什么他们不参与东欧的经济复苏，那是因为东欧的大部分地区已经在苏联的控制之下，**而且东欧地区也不想要美国那些“肮脏”的民主资金。我们会在另一个视频里详细讲这个。 +

不管怎样，美国提出的帮助西欧经济复苏的计划, 被称为**"马歇尔计划"，该计划于1947年实施。**这个计划为寻求重建的西欧国家, 分配了130亿美元的经济援助。如果你对1947年至1951年美国联邦预算不太了解，我告诉你，**130亿美元大约占那些年美国联邦预算的10%。**如果你还没被这个数字震惊到，我告诉你，这是一笔巨款。*美国那些年支出的10%都被用于西欧国家的经济复苏。* +

我强调这一点, 是因为你首先要问的问题是：为什么美国要把这么多钱送给其他国家呢？嗯，这是因为人们非常担心，*如果共产主义开始在西欧蔓延，那么共产主义就会接管整个世界。所以，如果花130亿美元能阻止共产主义，那肯定得花这笔钱。* +

那么现在的问题是：这个计划奏效了吗？答案是：是的，效果非常显著。所以在这种情况下，我们来看看马歇尔计划的一些影响。 +

第一个影响是西欧经济的快速复苏。**美国大量资金的涌入, 帮助西欧国家**迅速重建城市、道路和桥梁，因为**它们现在有钱购买所需的原材料。这反过来又让工业部门重新活跃起来，**工厂恢复生产，制造重建所需的商品。事实上，这个计划效果非常好，*到1950年，整个欧洲的工业产出超过了战前水平。* +

战后复苏的典型代表是西德（West Germany）。你可能会问：等等，海姆勒，西德是什么？嗯，战后德国基本上被分成了两半，西欧国家和美国援助西德，而苏联援助东德。不管怎样，随着马歇尔计划的资金涌入西德，西德的复苏非常显著，被称为“经济奇迹”。到1955年，仅西德的经济产出就大幅增长，超过了战前整个德国的产出。需要明确的是，*经济奇迹适用于整个西欧，但在西德尤为明显。* +

第二个影响是, 消费主义的重要性日益增加。从定义上来说，消费主义认为一个国家的经济状况取决于人们购买消费品。这些消费品包括汽车、洗衣机、服装以及几乎你能想到的所有东西。由于人们购买的制成品越来越多，工资大幅上涨，中产阶级也在扩大。 +

所以，就西欧的经济复苏而言，马歇尔计划奏效了吗？答案是：那当然。 +

Oh hey, welcome to Unit 9 of AP Euro. So the Second World War is over, and a lot of Europe is not much more than a smoking pile of rubble, which is to say post-war Europe is firmly seated on the struggle bus. So how are they going to rebuild everything when they already spent all their dang money on destroying it? Well, that's what this video is about. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked Marshall Plan style, then let's get to it.

So before we talk about what the Marshall Plan was, let me give you some context. After World War II was over, two global superpowers emerged from the wreckage: the Soviet Union and the United States. And the conflict between these two superpowers, known as the Cold War, will define global events until the last part of the 20th century. Now we'll talk all about the Cold War in other videos, but for now all you need to know is that much of the conflict between these two powers had to do with their political and economic worldview. The Soviet Union was organized as an authoritarian communist state, while the United States was organized as a democratic capitalist state. And each of these powers wanted to remake the entire world into the image either of communism or democracy.

And hey, if you got that National AP Euro exam breathing down your neck at this point, you might want to check out my AP Euro review pack, which has everything you need to study for and score a 5 on that exam. Link in description.

Okay, so when World War II was finally at an end, the democratic states of Western Europe were, as I mentioned, in a bad way. Their infrastructure had been destroyed by bombing, and their populations -- especially the male populations -- had been decimated by the fight. When states and populations are in real economic trouble, they might be sorely tempted to give communism a try. After all, under the dictates of a communist state -- at least in theory -- everyone would have enough food and everyone would have gainful employment. But the idea of these Western democracies falling to the influence of communism stank profoundly in the nostrils of the United States.

So big daddy America decided to get involved in Western Europe's economic recovery. And side note -- if you're wondering why they didn't get involved in Eastern Europe's recovery, it's because much of Eastern Europe was already under the thumb and authority of the Soviet Union, and they did not want any of that filthy democratic money. More on that in another video.

Anyway, the U.S. proposal to help in Western Europe's economic recovery became known as the Marshall Plan, which was implemented in 1947. This plan allocated 13 billion dollars in economic aid to Western nations seeking to rebuild. Just in case your knowledge of the 1947-1951 U.S. federal budget is a little shaky, let me just tell you that 13 billion was about 10 percent of the entire federal budget during those years. In case you haven't fallen out of your chair just yet, that is a lot. 10% of all U.S. spending for those years was sent to Western European states for their recovery.

And I emphasize that because the first question you have to ask is: why would the United States send so much stinking money to countries that are not themselves? Well, it's because there was a very real fear that if communism began to spread throughout Western Europe, then communism would take over the whole world. So if it takes 13 billion dollars to stop communism, you betcha sweet bippy we're spending 13 billion.

So the question now is: did it work? And the answer is: yeah, it worked phenomenally. So in that case, let's have a look at some of the effects of the Marshall Plan.

The first effect was rapid economic recovery in Western Europe. This massive influx of American money helped Western European states quickly rebuild cities and roads and bridges, since they now had the money to purchase the raw materials that they needed. This in turn got the industrial sector humming again, and factories roared back to life to produce the goods needed for reconstruction. In fact, it worked so well that by 1950, European industry on the whole surpassed its pre-war output.

And perhaps the poster child of post-war recovery was West Germany. And you're like: hold on Heimler, what's West Germany? Well after the war, Germany was essentially split into two halves, with Western European states and the United States aiding the Western half, and the Soviet Union aiding the Eastern. Anyway, as funds from the Marshall Plan flooded into West Germany, their recovery was so profound it was dubbed an economic miracle. By 1955, just the Western half of Germany had increased its economic output so much that it was larger than all of Germany's output before the war. Now to be clear, the economic miracle applied to all of Western Europe, but it was especially pronounced in West Germany.

The second effect was the increased importance of consumerism. Now consumerism, by definition, is the idea that the well-being of a nation's economy is dependent on people buying consumer goods. And those goods included things like cars and washing machines and clothing and darn near anything else you could think of. And as a result of people buying more and more manufactured goods, wages began to rise significantly and the middle class expanded.

So in terms of economic recovery in Western Europe, did the Marshall Plan work? And the answer is a resounding uh-huh.
