== 释义

If you want to know *what* the French Revolution *was all about* 到底是怎么回事, it's this: the people of France *wanted an equal seat* at the table of power 权力地位. And `主` the symbol 象征；标志 of that power `系` is _this head_ 头 right here. This is an important head. You got to know this head 你得了解这个脑袋, and I'm going to tell you all about it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked Guillotine-style, then let's get to it. +

Now, when I say the people of France, *I don't mean* all the people of France. I'm talking about the average 普通的，平常的 French citizen 公民. Like, if you were among the 97% of French people in the 18th century who were not the king or part of the nobility 贵族 or the clergy 神职人员, then your life was *not* going to be easy, *nor* was it going to be just (a.)公平的；公正的. Moreover 此外；而且, you would have *had precisely 恰好；精确地 zero power* to change (v.) your circumstances 环境；状况, because all the power for political change was held (v.) by those other groups I just mentioned. +

Now, it had been this way /for centuries 好几个世纪以来都是这样. But during this period, several factors 因素 are going #to converge (v.)聚集；汇聚# and rouse (v.)唤醒；激起 the people to claim (v.)宣称；要求 their rightful 正当的；合法的 seat at the table of power. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.converge
[ V]
1.~ (on...) : ( of people or vehicles人或车辆 ) to move towards a place from different directions and meet 汇集；聚集；集中 +
•Thousands of supporters *converged (v.) on London* for the rally. 成千上万的支持者从四面八方汇聚伦敦, 举行集会。 +
 +
2.( of two or more lines, paths, etc.多条线、小路等 ) to move towards each other and meet at a point （向某一点）相交，会合 +
•There was a signpost where *the two paths converged* (v.). 两条小路的相交处有一路标。 +
 +
3.if ideas, policies, aims, etc. converge , they become very similar or the same （思想、政策、目标等）十分相似，相同 +
OPP diverge +
====

First were economic crises 危机. Remember (v.) our boy Louis XIV *fought (v.) nearly endless wars* to establish (v.) his dominance 统治；控制 on the continent 大陆. But those wars were expensive and *plunged* (v.)使陷入；使遭受 France *deep into debt* 债务.
And you would think that /since all of France *would potentially 潜在地；可能地 benefit (v.) from* Louis's territorial 领土的 expansion 扩张, that everyone would shoulder (v.)承担 the cost of those wars. But here's where I tell you: you so crazy. No, the nobles and the clergy *were exempted (v.)免除；豁免 from* these taxes 税. And that meant that /`主` the entire economic burden 负担 of Louis's wars `谓` *fell (v.) on the shoulders of* the commoners 平民；百姓. +

So `主` _the very people_ who could afford (v.) *to have* their taxes *raised* (v.)提高，增加 `谓` were exempt (v.a.)免除，豁免, and `主` the people who struggled (v.) just to get the next meal in their bellies 腹部；肚子 `谓` *were saddled (v.)给……装马鞍；承受；使负担 with* 使承担；使负重担 new taxes. And the worst part? The people could do (v.) precisely nothing about it. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.saddle
-> ##sad-部分同 sit，##而-dle部分实际表工具，因saddle是你能够坐到马背上的工具。类似，needle缝针是缝纫的工具，和net网（编织而成）相关，再如spindle ['spɪnd(ə)l] n.轴；纺锤；细长的人或物，adj.锭子的，是spin纺纱的工具。

====

And why is that? So glad you asked, because *that leads (v.) us to* the second cause of the French Revolution. +

The second cause was _the imbalance 不平衡；失衡 of the Estates 财产,不动产 General_ 三级会议. Now, the _Estates General_ 三级会议 was a representative 有代表性的；典型的 body 团体；机构 of France which was made up of 由…组成 three estates <旧>社会阶层: the clergy （总称）神职人员, the nobility, and then everyone else. +

Under the growing pressure of France's economic crisis, Louis XVI called _the Estates General_ into #session （某项活动的）一段时间，一场；（议会等的）会议;开会；召开会议# to approve (v.)批准；同意 an increase in taxes. And you might be wondering: wasn't this during the age of _absolute monarchs_ 君主；帝王? Like, why didn't Louis just say, "Everybody's getting taxed 被征税, and if you don't like it, you can kiss my #croissant 羊角面包，新月形面包#"? +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Everybody’s getting taxed

1.句式结构：​​*#[主语] + ​​be getting​​ + [过去分词]#* +
*#这是一个​​"被动语态"​​的变体，表示​​“正在被施加某种行为”​​，强调​​“即将发生”或“被迫接受”​​。#*

- ​​"Getting taxed"​​ = ​​“被征税”​​（tax 是及物动词，过去分词形式表被动）。
- ​​"Be getting"​​ 代替传统被动语态 ​​"be taxed"​​，增添了一种​​“即将强制执行”​​的紧迫感。

2.为什么用 "getting" 而不是 "is/are"？​​ +
​​"Be getting + 过去分词"​​ 比 ​​"be + 过去分词"​​ 更口语化，*且隐含以下含义：* +
- ​*动作即将发生​​（类似 ​​"going to be taxed"​​）。* +
- ​带有强制或不可抗拒性​​（“你们没得选”）。 +
- ​*动态感更强​​（强调过程, 而非状态）。* +

3.对比​: +
- "Everybody #is taxed#."	#单纯陈述现状（中性）。# +
- "Everybody’#s getting taxed#."	​​“所有人##马上要交税了##”​​#（强制+进行感）#。 +
- "Everybody #will be taxed#."	#未来时，但缺少紧迫感。# +
- "Everybody’#s about to be taxed#."	接近，但不如 "getting" 口语化。 +

4.类似表达​​ +
- "You’*re getting fired*!" （“你马上要被开除了！”） +
- "The car’*s getting repaired*." （“车正在被修。”） +
- "We’*re getting married* next week." （“我们下周结婚。”） +

5.其他 "get + 过去分词" 的用法​​

- 表被动​​（口语中替代 "be"）： "My phone *got stolen*." （手机被偷了。）
- 表状态变化​​：
"*She got married* last year." （她去年结婚了。）
- 表意外事件​​：
"*He got hit* by a bike." （他被自行车撞了。）

6.总结​​ +
​​"Getting taxed"​​ = ​​“被征税”​​（口语化被动，强调强制+动态）。 +
​​与 "is taxed" 的区别​​：前者更生动，后者更静态。 +
​​翻译关键​​：中文需用​​“要/马上/给我”​​等词传递原文的强势语气。 +



.croissant
-> 来自crescent, 新月形。因形似新月而得名。来自PIE*ker , 创造，生长，##词源同 create。-esce, 表起始。##最早指月相由亏转盈的阶段，但后来错误的用来指这一阶段的形状。

image:/img/croissant.jpg[,15%]

.Kiss my croissant
"Kiss my croissant"​​ 直译为 ​​“亲我的可颂面包”​​，但显然不是字面意思。 +
这是一个​​幽默改编的粗俗表达​​，原型是英语里的 ​​"Kiss my ass"​​（字面“亲我的屁股”，实际意思是 ​​“去你的/滚蛋”​​）。

为什么用 "croissant"（可颂面包）？​​
​​文化梗​​：可颂面包（羊角包）是​​法国标志性食物​​，作者用“可颂”替换“屁股”（ass），既保留了原短语的挑衅语气，又增添了​​法国特色幽默​​。 +
用 "kiss my croissant" 这种“软绵绵”的威胁，暗示路易十六​​缺乏真正"专制君主"的魄力。


.Louis XVI
image:/img/Louis XVI.avif[,20%]

路易十六 （Louis-Auguste； 法语： [lwi sɛːz] ；1754 年 8 月 23 日-1793 年 1 月 21 日）是法国大革命期间君主制垮台前的最后一位法国国王 。

**路易十六统治初期，他尝试按照启蒙运动的思想, 对法国政府进行改革。**这些尝试包括增加对非天主教徒的宽容, 以及废除对逃兵的死刑。*法国贵族对提议的改革持敌意态度，并成功地阻止了改革的实施。*

路易在他的"经济自由主义"大臣杜尔哥的倡导下，**实施了放松对粮食市场的管制 ，但这却导致面包价格上涨。**在歉收时期，这导致粮食短缺，而在 1775 年的一次特别歉收期间， 甚至引发了群众的起义 。

从 1776 年起，**路易十六积极支持北美殖民者 ，他们寻求脱离英国而独立 ，**并于 1783 年签署了《巴黎条约》 。**随之而来的债务和金融危机, 加剧了旧制度不得人心。这导致了 1789 年三级会议的召开。**法国中下层阶级成员的不满情绪, 加剧了对法国贵族和君主专制的反对，路易十六和他的妻子Marie Antoinette 玛丽·安托瓦内特, 就是其中的代表。诸如攻占巴士底狱等事件加剧了紧张局势和暴力冲突，*巴黎骚乱迫使路易十六最终承认"国民议会"的"立法权"。*

**路易的优柔寡断和保守主义, 导致部分法国民众将他视为旧制度暴政的象征，**他的支持率逐渐下降。1791 年 6 月，在"君主立宪制"宣布前四个月，*他逃往瓦伦失败，这似乎证实了有关"国王将其政治救赎的希望, 寄托在外国干预的前景上"的谣言。他的信誉被严重损害.* 废除君主制 、建立共和国的可能性越来越大。革命者中"反教权主义"的兴起, 导致废除宗教土地税, 和几项旨在法国非基督教化的政府政策。

在内战和国际战争的背景下，路易十六在1792 年 8 月 10 日起义期间, 被停职, 并被捕。一个月后，"君主制"被废除，**"法兰西第一共和国"于 1792 年 9 月 21 日宣告成立。这位前国王成为了一名去神圣化的法国公民，**被称为 Citoyen Louis Capet （公民路易斯·卡佩），以纪念他的祖先休·卡佩。 +
**路易十六受到"国民公会"（为此而自行设立的法庭）的审判，被判犯有叛国罪，并**于 1793 年 1 月 21 日**被送上断头台。**路易十六的去世, 结束了法国一千多年的连续君主制。 +

他的两个儿子都在波旁复辟之前的童年时期去世。他唯一成年的孩子玛丽·特蕾莎 (Marie Thérèse ) 被送给她的奥地利亲戚，以换取法国战俘，最终于 1851 年无儿无女地去世。


.Marie Antoinette
玛丽·安托瓦内特( 1755 年 11 月 2 日 - 1793 年 10 月 16 日）是法国大革命和法兰西第一共和国成立前的最后一位法国王后 。她是路易十六的妻子。

1792 年 9 月 21 日，法国宣布为共和国， 君主制被废除 。  +
路易十六于 1793 年 1 月 21 日被送上断头台 。 +
玛丽·安托瓦内特的审判于 1793 年 10 月 14 日开始；两天后，她被革命法庭判定犯有叛国罪，并于 1793 年 10 月 16 日在革命广场被送上断头台处决。
====


Well, *as it turns out* 结果是；事实证明, Louis was a #timid (a.)胆小的；胆怯的# kind of guy, and the nobles and the clergy *asserted (v.)宣称；声称 their power* 维护；坚持自己的权利（或权威等）and weakened (v.)削弱 the monarchy 君主制；君主政体. So when Louis did try to impose (v.)推行；强制实行 new taxes by his own authority 权力；权威, the noble judges 法官 of the Parliament of Paris *shut him down* 关闭他, 使停止；使结束. So Louis was forced (v.) *to call (v.) this body*, the Estates General, *into session* /to get approval for new taxes. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.timid
-> 来自拉丁语 timere,使恐惧，可能来自 PIE*teme,黑暗的，词源同 temerity,tenebrous.


====

Okay, but here's the imbalance that I was talking about. The #Estates General （法国旧制度中的）三级会议#, as I said, *was made up of* 由…组成，由…构成 France's three #estates <旧>社会阶层#. The First Estate, the Catholic clergy, made up about 1% of the population 人口. The Second Estate, the nobility, made up about 2% of the population. And then the Third Estate represented (v.) everyone else in the kingdom. +

But within 在里面，在内部 the Estates General, each estate only got (v.) one vote 投票；表决. And since the First and Second Estates had similar interests, they always voted (v.) together. So #*get this right* 把这一点搞清楚,听好了,注意这一点#: 3% of the population *decided* (v.) _how life would go_ *for* the other 97%. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Get this right
"Get this right"​​ 直译为 ​​“把这一点搞清楚”​​ 或 ​​“听好了”​​。
这是一个​​口语化表达​​，用于强调接下来的信息​​很重要、很惊人，或者需要特别注意​​。 +
**"Get this right"​​ 带有一种​​“你必须明白这一点”​​的紧迫感，**暗示接下来的内容​​颠覆常识​​。


====


So the people wanted a place at the table of power, and the Estates General *prevented* (v.)阻止；阻碍 them *from* that. +

And the third _immediate (a.)直接的; 立刻的，即时的；目前的 cause (n.)直接原因_ of the French Revolution was _bread 面包 shortages_ 短缺. #*If it wasn't bad enough /that* 如果…还不够糟糕的话;情况已经很糟了，但更糟的是…# the people of France *were bowed down* 压弯；压垮;鞠躬 under the weight of _unfair tax policies_ 政策, and they had no power in the Estates General to fix it, now by 1788, famines 饥荒 had made _bread ##scarce##_ #缺乏的；不足的#, and _a large bulk 大部分 of_ the French lower classes 阶层 were suffering (v.) hunger and #want (n.)缺少；缺乏；不足;贫困；匮乏#. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.If it wasn’t bad enough that...
​​"If it wasn’t bad enough that..."​​ 直译为 ​​“如果……还不够糟糕的话”​​。
这是一个​​英语惯用表达​​，*用于强调​​“情况已经很糟了，但更糟的是……”​​，通常引出另一个更严重的问题。*

​​第一层问题​​（已经很糟）：
"the people of France were bowed down under the weight of unfair tax policies"
（法国人民被不公平的税收政策压垮。） +
​​第二层问题​​（雪上加霜）：
"they had no power in the Estates General to fix it"
（他们在三级会议中无力改变现状。） +
​​第三层问题​​（最直接的导火索）：
"by 1788, famines had made bread scarce"
（1788年，饥荒导致面包短缺。）

- 为什么用虚拟语气（wasn’t）？​​ +
​​"If it *wasn’t* bad enough"​​（虚拟语气）暗示​​“实际情况确实已经够糟了”​​，但后面还要补充更糟的事。 +
- 对比直陈语气： +
"It was bad that..., but worse..." （中性陈述） +
"If it wasn’t bad enough that..., then..." （情感更强烈，更具戏剧性）。




.want
(n.)LACK 缺少 +
2.[ Using.]~ of sth : formal ) a situation in which there is not enough of sth; a lack of sth缺少；缺乏；不足 +

And their _first order_ 业务的第一顺序;首要任务;第一项议程 of business 首要事务 was to grant (v.)授予；同意 themselves the power over taxation 征税 in France. So hey, victory for the people 人民的胜利, right? They *got their place* at the table of power 他们在权力的桌子上占有一席之地. +

Well, not really 不完全是. In June 1789, the representatives of the Third Estate tried to enter (v.) another meeting of the Estates General /and *were barred (v.)阻挡；拦住 from* 被禁止 getting in. So they went to a nearby tennis court /and #swore (v.)发誓# _the Tennis Court #Oath (誓言，誓约)# 网球场宣誓_, by which they promised _not to leave (v.) that place_ /until they had drafted (v.)起草；制定 a new constitution 宪法 for France. +

====

This event was the first real uprising (n.)起义；暴动 of the French Revolution. People had their place at the table of power, and they refused *to let it go*. +

So now the French Revolution has properly 真正地；实际上 started, and you should know that traditionally 传统上, we talk about two phases 阶段；时期 of the revolution. +

First is the liberal 自由的 phase. During this phase, the National Assembly drafted (v.) the Declaration of _the Rights of Man and Citizen_ 人权和公民权宣言, which *provided for* 规定；提供 _freedom of speech_ 言论自由, _a representative government_ 代议制政府 (which is to say, a constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制), and maybe *most significant 重要的；显著的 of all*, abolished (v.)废除；废止 _##hereditary (a.)世袭的;（特点或疾病）遗传的## privileges_ 特权 of the First and Second Estates. +

And *not to #brag#* #(v.)吹嘘；自夸;自吹自擂# or anything, but you should know that /this document 文件 was deeply inspired (v.) by 受…启发 the American _Declaration of Independence_ 美国独立宣言 and _the Bill of Rights_ 权利法案. So you know, America. +

Anyway, the National Assembly also nationalized (v.)国有化；收归国有 the Catholic Church /by passing (v.) _the Civil Constitution 宪法，章程 of the Clergy_ 神职人员民事组织法 in 1790.  +
The Assembly disbanded (v.)解散，遣散 the Church's monastic (a.)修道院的；僧尼的 orders （按照一定的规范生活的）宗教团体；（尤指）修会, #confiscated (v.)没收；充公# Church lands, eliminated (v.)消除；废除 the #tithe 什一税# (which was a tax the peasants 农民 had to *pay to* the Church), and clergy （总称）神职人员 were placed (v.) under the authority of the state 国家政权. +

[.my1]

.confiscate
-> ##con-, 强调。-fisc, 篮子，钱篓，## 词源同basket,fiscal.

.tithe
-> 特殊用法，#词源同 tenth# 或 tenth 拼写变体。
====

Now, during the liberal phase 自由主义阶段, women *played a big role* as well, specifically 具体地；明确地 in the October March on Versailles 十月凡尔赛游行 in 1789. Now, remember that /bread was scarce  缺乏的，不足的 during this time. And so, *whipped 鞭打；挥动 into* 激起，使兴奋 a fury 激起愤怒 by _the extravagant 奢侈的；铺张的 excesses_ 无节制；过度 of Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette, thousands of women *marched* (v.) in the pouring rain 倾盆大雨 *to* Versailles /and *demanded (v.) that* the king and his wife give them all the bread 后定说明 that they were #hoarding (a.)囤积；贮藏# within the palace walls 宫墙. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.hoard
[ VVN] to collect and keep large amounts of food, money, etc., especially secretly 贮藏；囤积；（尤指）秘藏 +
-> 来自古英语hord,宝藏，藏宝处，来自PIE*skeu,覆盖，隐藏，##词源同 hide,house.## 引申词义贮藏，囤积。


====

Now, of course, they did not do that. And so the women stormed (v.)猛攻，突袭 the palace and, in doing so 在这样做的过程中, killed (v.) several guards and put their heads on #pikes 长矛#. And that's where _the old French saying_ (n.)谚语，格言 *comes from*: if you *mess (v.) with* 惹麻烦，与（某人）作对;干预；惹恼 a woman's bread, she'll *cut off* your head. +

Anyway, the women forced(v.)  the king to accept _the Declaration of the Rights of Man_ as citizens, and they would *have killed* him /if it weren't for _the intervention_ 干涉；干预 of _everyone's favorite (a.)（同类中）最受喜爱的  fighting Frenchman_, the Marquis de Lafayette 拉法耶特侯爵. +

[.my2]
总之，妇女们迫使国王接受了《人权宣言》作为公民的地位，如果不是大家最喜欢的法国战士拉法耶特侯爵的介入，他们可能会杀了国王。

Now, what's kind of astonishing 令人惊讶的 is that /these women did all of this /*despite the fact that* 尽管，虽然 women's rights were not even represented (v.) in the Declaration.  +
Later, Olympe de Gouges 奥兰普·德古热 would craft (v.)精心制作 the Declaration of _the Rights_ of _Woman and the Female Citizen_ 妇女和女性公民权利宣言, which would #articulate (v.)明确表达# and *fight (v.) for* the rights of women in France. +

Due to her work, along with other women's groups at the time, the legal status 法律地位 of women improved (v.). But eventually 最终；最后, much of this would *be overturned* (v.) 推翻；废除, and citizenship 公民身份 would *be restricted to* 限于 men. +

So the people *are* very much *getting their place* at the table of power. But now we get to _the radical 激进的 phase_ of the revolution, and the people are going *to get a little drunk* 喝醉的，陶醉的 on that power 陶醉于权力. +

Now, by 1790, the National Assembly had broken into 分裂成 factions 派别；派系, `主` the most radical of which `系` were the Jacobins 雅各宾派. In 1792, _the National Assembly_ voted (v.) *to dissolve (v.) 解散;（使）溶解 itself* /and create a more permanent 永久的；长期的 parliament 议会 called _the National Convention_ (（某职业、政党等成员的）大会，集会) 国民公会. +

The Jacobins were able *to seize (v.) control of* 夺取对…的控制权 the Convention /and implemented (v.)实施；执行 _a more radical set of_ policies. First, they fundamentally 根本地 reordered (v.)重新安排 time /by *declaring (v.)宣布，声明 that* _Year One_ 史上第一年,公元元年 `系` was *no longer* the year of Christ's birth /*but rather* 1792, which they called _the Era of Liberty_ 自由时代. +

Second, they dissolved (v.) the _constitutional monarchy_ 君主立宪制度 which had been established by _the National Assembly_. They decided #to punt (v.)抛弃；踢走# the king /and declare (v.) France a true republic 共和国. +

Now, when I say "punted (v.) the king," that's just another way of saying /he *went ahead* and *got his head cut off*. That's the head, people. That's the head you gotta know. `主` What you're seeing here `系` is the people of France *holding up* 举起;支撑，支持 the head of King Louis XVI. +

And so the monarchy was done, and _the people_ reigned (v.)统治，支配 _supreme_ (a.)（级别或地位）最高的，至高无上的；主宰一切. But unfortunately for the Jacobins, that's not where the story ends 这并不是故事的结尾. +

​​*"Reign"​​ 在这里是​​状态性动词​​（类似 "be"、"become"、"seem"），表示「处于统治地位」，而非具体的动作。* +
​​"Supreme"​​ 补充说明的是 ​​"the people" 的地位​​（人民是至高无上的），而非修饰 "如何统治"（副词用法）。 +
​​对比例子：​​ +

|Gemini 的说明:
|这里的 supreme 不是修饰 reigned 这个动词的，它也不是副词。

#*这里的 supreme 是一个"主语补语" (Subject Complement)，它补充说明了主语 the people 的状态或性质，而不是修饰动词的动作方式。*#

*#"主语补语"的特征：# +

- 通常跟在系动词（如 be, seem, become 等）后面*：比如 "He is happy" (Happy 是主语补语，修饰 He)。 +
- *但##也可以跟在某些表示“状态改变”、“结果”或“地位”的动词后面：##这类动词被称为"不完全及物动词"或"系动词的延伸"，例如：* +
reign (统治/称王) +
stand (站立/处于某种状态) +
fall (跌落/陷入某种状态) +
come (变成) +
go (变成) +
appear (显得) +
prove (证明是) +
elect (选举为) +
make (使成为) +
call (称呼为) +

"reigned (v.) supreme (a.)" 的具体分析： +
在这个短语中，reigned 这个动词不仅仅表示“统治”这个动作，它还暗示了“以……的身份或状态,进行统治”。supreme 正是用来补充说明这种“状态”——即“人民处于最高统治地位”或“人民成为最高统治者”。 +

你可以将 "reigned supreme" 理解为类似 "became supreme rulers" (成为了最高统治者) 或 "held supreme power" (掌握了最高权力) 的意思。这里的 supreme 描述的是人民所达到的那种最高无上的地位或状态。 +

为什么不用副词 supremely？ +
如果用副词 supremely，the people reigned supremely，那意思会变成“人民以一种至高无上的方式进行统治”，这修饰的是“统治”这个动作的“方式”，听起来会非常奇怪，不符合原句想表达的“人民成为最高权力拥有者”的意思。 +

类似用法： +
He stands tall. (他站得很高/他显得高大。) -- tall 形容 He 的状态。 +
The leaves turn red. (树叶变红。) -- red 形容 The leaves 变后的状态。 +
He fell silent. (他沉默了。) -- silent 形容 He 变后的状态。 +
They elected him president. (他们选举他为总统。) -- president 是宾语补语，修饰 him 变成的状态。 +

所以，"the people reigned supreme" 是完全正确的，supreme 在这里是一个形容词作主语补语，描述了主语“人民”所达到的“最高统治”的状态。 +

== 中文释义

如果你想知道"法国大革命"是怎么回事，是这样的：法国人民想要在权力的餐桌上, 获得平等的一席之地。而这种权力的象征, 就是这个（断头台的）脑袋。这是个重要的脑袋。你得了解这个脑袋，我会告诉你关于它的一切。所以，如果你准备好像断头台行刑那样, 充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

现在，当我说法国人民时，我不是指所有的法国人民。我说的是普通的法国公民。比如说，如果你属于18世纪97%的法国人中的一员，这些人既不是国王，也不是贵族或神职人员，那么你的生活既不容易，也不公平。此外，你完全没有能力改变自己的处境，因为政治变革的所有权力都掌握在我刚才提到的那些群体手中。  +

几个世纪以来一直都是这样。但**在这个时期，几个因素汇聚在一起，唤醒了人们去争取他们在权力的餐桌上应有的席位。**  +

首先是经济危机。还记得我们说的**路易十四（Louis XIV）吧，他打了几乎无休止的战争, 来确立他在欧洲大陆的统治地位。但这些战争耗资巨大，让法国深陷债务之中。**你可能会想，既然整个法国都可能从路易的领土扩张中受益，那么每个人都应该承担这些战争的费用。但我要告诉你：你太天真了。不，*#贵族和神职人员都不用交税。这意味着路易战争的整个经济负担都落在了平民的肩上。#*  +

所以，**#那些有能力承受税收增加的人免税，而那些连温饱都难以维持的人, 却背负着新的税收负担。#**最糟糕的是，人们对此完全无能为力。  +

为什么会这样呢？很高兴你问这个问题，因为这就引出了"法国大革命"的第二个原因。  +

第二个原因是**"三级会议"（Estates General）的不平衡。三级会议是法国的一个代表机构，由三个等级组成：神职人员、贵族和其他所有人。**  +

*在法国经济危机不断加剧的压力下，##路易十六（Louis XVI）召开了三级会议，以批准增加税收。##你可能会想：这不是在"绝对君主制时代"吗？比如说，路易为什么不直接说：“每个人都要交税，如果你不喜欢，那就一边去”？*  +

嗯，**事实证明，**路易是个胆小的人，*贵族和神职人员维护他们的权力，削弱了君主的权力。所以当路易试图凭自己的权力, 征收新税时，巴黎议会（Parliament of Paris）的贵族法官们阻止了他。所以路易被迫召开这个三级会议，以获得新税的批准。*  +

好的，但这就是我所说的不平衡之处。正如我所说，*"三级会议"由法国的三个等级组成。第一等级，即天主教神职人员，约占人口的1%。第二等级，即贵族，约占人口的2%。然后第三等级代表了王国中的其他所有人。*  +

*#但在三级会议中，每个等级只有一票。而且由于第一等级和第二等级, 有着相似的利益，他们总是一起投票 (2票 vs 1票, 获胜)。所以听好了：3%的人口, 决定了其他97%人口的生活走向。#*  +

*所以，人民想要在"权力的餐桌上"有一席之地，而三级会议却阻止了他们。*  +

"法国大革命"的第三个直接原因, 是面包短缺。法国人民不仅承受着不公平税收政策的重压，而且在三级会议中, 他们没有权力改变这种状况，情况还不止如此，到**1788年，饥荒使面包变得稀缺，法国大部分下层阶级都在遭受饥饿和贫困。**  +

*1789年，"三级会议"召开, 以解决这些危机。第一等级和第二等级明确表示，除非符合他们自己的利益，否则他们不会为解决这些问题做任何事情。毕竟，他们是在会议中掌握所有权力的人，他们并不急于把权力交给第三等级的民众。*  +

所以，*#当第三等级的成员看到, 他们的诉求没有希望得到满足，便站了起来，离开了会议，他们以一种前所未有的大胆行为，宣布自己才是法国唯一真正的代表机构。他们将自己命名为"国民议会"#*（National Assembly）。  +

**他们的首要任务, 是赋予自己在法国的"征税批准权"。**所以，这对人民来说是胜利，对吧？他们在权力的餐桌上有了自己的位置。  +

嗯，也不完全是。*1789年6月，#第三等级的代表, 试图进入"三级会议"的另一次会议，但被拒之门外。于是他们去了附近的一个网球场，宣誓了“网球场誓言”，他们承诺在为法国起草出"新宪法"之前, 不会离开那个地方(罢工,罢课, 在政府机构面大门前示威)。#*  +

**当他们最终完成"宪法"起草后，路易十六被迫接受了对他权力的这一新限制，但他却秘密召集法国军队来镇压"国民议会"。这一阴谋被发现后，**一个被称为“无套裤汉”（sans-culottes）的反叛团体, *攻占了象征国王暴政的巴士底狱*（Bastille）。  +

这一事件是"法国大革命"的第一次真正的起义。人们在权力的餐桌上, 有了自己的位置，而且他们不会轻易放弃。  +

所以**现在"法国大革命"正式开始了，**你应该知道，传统上，我们把**这场革命分为两个阶段。**  +

*#首先是"自由派阶段"。在这个阶段，国民议会起草了《人权和公民权宣言》（Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen），该宣言规定了言论自由、代议制政府（也就是说，君主立宪制），最最重要的是，废除了"第一等级"和"第二等级"的世袭特权。#*  +

不是自夸什么，但你应该知道，**这份文件深受《美国独立宣言》（American Declaration of Independence）和《权利法案》（Bill of Rights）的启发。**所以，你懂的，美国的影响。  +

不管怎样，*##"国民议会"##还通过了1790年的《教士公民组织法》（Civil Constitution of the Clergy），将天主教会国有化。议会解散了教会的修道院团体##，没收了教会的土地，取消了"什一税"（这是农民必须交给教会的税），神职人员被置于国家的管辖之下。##*  +

现在，**在"自由派阶段"，女性也发挥了重要作用，**特别是在1789年的“十月进军凡尔赛”事件中。记住，**这个时期面包稀缺。**所以，被路易十六和他的妻子玛丽·安托瓦内特（Marie Antoinette）的奢侈行为激怒后，*数千名女性在倾盆大雨中游行到凡尔赛，要求国王和他的妻子, 把他们囤积在宫殿里的面包都拿出来。*  +

*当然，他们没有这么做。于是这些女性冲进了宫殿，在此过程中，她们杀死了几名卫兵，并把他们的头颅挑在长矛上。#这就是那句古老的法国谚语的由来：如果你动了一个女人的面包，她就会砍掉你的头。#*  +

不管怎样，**这些女性迫使国王接受了《人权宣言》，**要不是拉法耶特侯爵（Marquis de Lafayette）的干预，她们可能就把国王杀了。  +

令人惊讶的是，尽管"女性权利"甚至没有在《人权宣言》中得到体现，但这些女性还是做了这些事情。后来，奥林普·德·古热（Olympe de Gouges）撰写了《妇女和女公民权利宣言》（Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen），该宣言阐述并为"法国女性的权利"而抗争。  +

由于她的努力，以及当时的其他女性团体的努力，女性的法律地位得到了改善。但最终，其中的很多成果都被推翻了，公民身份被限制在男性范围内。  +

所以，人民在权力的餐桌上有了自己的位置。但现在我们进入了革命的激进阶段，人们开始有点沉迷于这种权力了。  +

*到1790年，#"国民议会"分裂成了不同的派别，其中最激进的是雅各宾派#（Jacobins）。1792年，#"国民议会"投票决定解散自己，并成立了一个更永久的议会，称为"国民公会"#*（National Convention）。  +

**雅各宾派得以控制"国民公会"，并实施了一系列更为激进的政策。**首先，他们从根本上重新规定了时间，宣布元年不再是以基督诞生为标志，而是1792年，他们称之为“自由时代”。  +

其次，*#他们解散了由"国民议会"建立的"君主立宪制"。他们决定废黜国王，并宣布法国成为一个真正的"共和国"。#*  +

现在，当我说“废黜国王”时，也就是说**他们把国王的头砍掉了。**就是这个脑袋，各位。这就是你得知道的脑袋。你看到的是法国人民高举着路易十六国王的头颅。  +

**所以"君主制"结束了，**人民至高无上。但对雅各宾派来说不幸的是，故事并没有就此结束。  +

**其他欧洲国家，**这些国家恰好喜欢"君主制"体系，他们对法国人民斩首国王的行为**感到震惊。毕竟，如果法国人砍掉了他们国王的头，那又有什么能阻止我们国家的人民砍掉我们的头呢？**  +

所以**#一些周边国家联合起来反对法国。面对这场危机，雅各宾派和"国民公会"中较为温和的成员, 在解决方案上无法达成一致。#**  +

所以，*#随着他们运动中的裂痕开始显现，并且担心"革命的成果"面临风险，雅各宾派主导的国民公会, 严厉镇压法国民众的任何异议。#*  +

*#革命的这个阶段, 被称为“恐怖统治”#*（Reign of Terror）。与恐怖统治联系在一起的领导人, 是激进的雅各宾派成员 马克西米连·罗伯斯庇尔（Maximilien Robespierre）。  +

事实证明，*罗伯斯庇尔喜欢砍头，因为在他的领导下，由他建立的"公共安全委员会"（Committee of Public Safety）用断头台, 处决了超过4万人。*  +

为了实现这种控制——为了保护法国免受威胁革命的敌国的侵害——**他们通过大规模征兵, 组建了欧洲有史以来最大的军队。**18岁到25岁的男性都必须参军。  +

*这支军队不仅负责在国内保护革命，#还负责将革命理念, 传播到周边的欧洲国家。#*  +

最终，**#恐怖统治变得如此残酷，"公共安全委员会"的行为, 就像一个专制的混蛋，#**委员会的一些反对者, 开始挑战它的行为。  +

**#毕竟，这场革命是为了让人民在"权力的餐桌上"获得平等的地位，#**而现在法国各地的篮子里, 装着四万颗头颅。  +

所以这些挑战者, 终结了恐怖统治，1794年，*他们把送上了断头台。罗伯斯庇尔本人*  +

== pure

If you want to know what the French Revolution was all about, it's this: the people of France wanted an equal seat at the table of power. And the symbol of that power is this head right here. This is an important head. You got to know this head, and I'm going to tell you all about it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked Guillotine-style, then let's get to it.

Now, when I say the people of France, I don't mean all the people of France. I'm talking about the average French citizen. Like, if you were among the 97% of French people in the 18th century who were not the king or part of the nobility or the clergy, then your life was not going to be easy, nor was it going to be just. Moreover, you would have had precisely zero power to change your circumstances, because all the power for political change was held by those other groups I just mentioned.

Now, it had been this way for centuries. But during this period, several factors are going to converge and rouse the people to claim their rightful seat at the table of power.

First were economic crises. Remember our boy Louis XIV fought nearly endless wars to establish his dominance on the continent. But those wars were expensive and plunged France deep into debt. And you would think that since all of France would potentially benefit from Louis's territorial expansion, that everyone would shoulder the cost of those wars. But here's where I tell you: you so crazy. No, the nobles and the clergy were exempted from these taxes. And that meant that the entire economic burden of Louis's wars fell on the shoulders of the commoners.

So the very people who could afford to have their taxes raised were exempt, and the people who struggled just to get the next meal in their bellies were saddled with new taxes. And the worst part? The people could do precisely nothing about it.

And why is that? So glad you asked, because that leads us to the second cause of the French Revolution.

The second cause was the imbalance of the Estates General. Now, the Estates General was a representative body of France which was made up of three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and then everyone else.

Under the growing pressure of France's economic crisis, Louis XVI called the Estates General into session to approve an increase in taxes. And you might be wondering: wasn't this during the age of absolute monarchs? Like, why didn't Louis just say, "Everybody's getting taxed, and if you don't like it, you can kiss my croissant"?

Well, as it turns out, Louis was a timid kind of guy, and the nobles and the clergy asserted their power and weakened the monarchy. So when Louis did try to impose new taxes by his own authority, the noble judges of the Parliament of Paris shut him down. So Louis was forced to call this body, the Estates General, into session to get approval for new taxes.

Okay, but here's the imbalance that I was talking about. The Estates General, as I said, was made up of France's three estates. The First Estate, the Catholic clergy, made up about 1% of the population. The Second Estate, the nobility, made up about 2% of the population. And then the Third Estate represented everyone else in the kingdom.

But within the Estates General, each estate only got one vote. And since the First and Second Estates had similar interests, they always voted together. So get this right: 3% of the population decided how life would go for the other 97%.

So the people wanted a place at the table of power, and the Estates General prevented them from that.

And the third immediate cause of the French Revolution was bread shortages. If it wasn't bad enough that the people of France were bowed down under the weight of unfair tax policies, and they had no power in the Estates General to fix it, now by 1788, famines had made bread scarce, and a large bulk of the French lower classes were suffering hunger and want.

Now, in 1789, the Estates General met to solve these crises. And the First and Second Estates made it clear that they would do nothing to solve these problems unless it was in their own interests. After all, they're the ones who had all the power at the table, and they weren't eager to give it over to the rabble in the Third Estate.

And so, seeing that their cause was futile, members of the Third Estate stood up, left the meeting, and in an act of unprecedented chutzpah, declared themselves to be the one true representative body of France. And they named themselves the National Assembly.

And their first order of business was to grant themselves the power over taxation in France. So hey, victory for the people, right? They got their place at the table of power.

Well, not really. In June 1789, the representatives of the Third Estate tried to enter another meeting of the Estates General and were barred from getting in. So they went to a nearby tennis court and swore the Tennis Court Oath, by which they promised not to leave that place until they had drafted a new constitution for France.

When they had finally completed it, Louis XVI was forced to accept this new limitation on his power but was secretly assembling French troops to crush the Assembly. Once this plot was discovered, a rebel group known as the sans-culottes stormed the Bastille, which was a prison that symbolized the tyranny of the king.

This event was the first real uprising of the French Revolution. People had their place at the table of power, and they refused to let it go.

So now the French Revolution has properly started, and you should know that traditionally, we talk about two phases of the revolution.

First is the liberal phase. During this phase, the National Assembly drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, which provided for freedom of speech, a representative government (which is to say, a constitutional monarchy), and maybe most significant of all, abolished hereditary privileges of the First and Second Estates.

And not to brag or anything, but you should know that this document was deeply inspired by the American Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. So you know, America.

Anyway, the National Assembly also nationalized the Catholic Church by passing the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790. The Assembly disbanded the Church's monastic orders, confiscated Church lands, eliminated the tithe (which was a tax the peasants had to pay to the Church), and clergy were placed under the authority of the state.

Now, during the liberal phase, women played a big role as well, specifically in the October March on Versailles in 1789. Now, remember that bread was scarce during this time. And so, whipped into a fury by the extravagant excesses of Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette, thousands of women marched in the pouring rain to Versailles and demanded that the king and his wife give them all the bread that they were hoarding within the palace walls.

Now, of course, they did not do that. And so the women stormed the palace and, in doing so, killed several guards and put their heads on pikes. And that's where the old French saying comes from: if you mess with a woman's bread, she'll cut off your head.

Anyway, the women forced the king to accept the Declaration of the Rights of Man as citizens, and they would have killed him if it weren't for the intervention of everyone's favorite fighting Frenchman, the Marquis de Lafayette.

Now, what's kind of astonishing is that these women did all of this despite the fact that women's rights were not even represented in the Declaration. Later, Olympe de Gouges would craft the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen, which would articulate and fight for the rights of women in France.

Due to her work, along with other women's groups at the time, the legal status of women improved. But eventually, much of this would be overturned, and citizenship would be restricted to men.

So the people are very much getting their place at the table of power. But now we get to the radical phase of the revolution, and the people are going to get a little drunk on that power.

Now, by 1790, the National Assembly had broken into factions, the most radical of which were the Jacobins. In 1792, the National Assembly voted to dissolve itself and create a more permanent parliament called the National Convention.

The Jacobins were able to seize control of the Convention and implemented a more radical set of policies. First, they fundamentally reordered time by declaring that Year One was no longer the year of Christ's birth but rather 1792, which they called the Era of Liberty.

Second, they dissolved the constitutional monarchy which had been established by the National Assembly. They decided to punt the king and declare France a true republic.

Now, when I say "punted the king," that's just another way of saying he went ahead and got his head cut off. That's the head, people. That's the head you gotta know. What you're seeing here is the people of France holding up the head of King Louis XVI.

And so the monarchy was done, and the people reigned supreme. But unfortunately for the Jacobins, that's not where the story ends.

Other European states, who happened to like the system of monarchy, were truly horrified by the people beheading their king. After all, if the French cut off their king's head, what would stop our people from cutting off our heads?

And so some of these surrounding states allied against France. And in the face of this crisis, the Jacobins and the more moderate members of the National Convention could not agree on a solution.

And so, with the fractures of their movement beginning to show, and fearing that the gains of the revolution were at risk, the Jacobin-dominated Convention clamped down hard on any dissent from the French population.

This phase of the revolution became known as the Reign of Terror. Now, the leader to associate with the Reign of Terror is radical Jacobin Maximilien Robespierre.

As it turns out, Robespierre was a fan of cutting off heads, because under his leadership, over 40,000 people were put to death at the guillotine by a group that he established called the Committee of Public Safety.

Now, to accomplish this kind of control -- in order to protect France from the enemy states that had threatened the revolution -- they built the largest army Europe had ever seen through mass conscription. Any man 18 to 25 was required to serve in the army.

Not only was this army charged with protecting the revolution at home, but also to spread those ideals to surrounding Europe.

Now, eventually, the Reign of Terror became so brutal, and the Committee was acting like such an authoritarian turd, that some detractors of the Committee itself began to challenge its actions.

Like, this whole revolution was fought to give people an equal place at the table of power, and we've got forty thousand heads in baskets all over France.

And so these challengers themselves put an end to the Reign of Terror, which was accomplished by putting Robespierre himself in the guillotine in 1794.
