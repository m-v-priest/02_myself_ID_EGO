== 释义

Okay, now with all this nationalism 民族主义 and unification 统一 and imperialism 帝国主义 dominating (v.)支配；统治；在……中具有最重要（或明显）的特色 this period, you *bet* (v.) your sweet bippy <美，俚>屁股，臀部 *that* `主` the art of this time `谓` is going to reflect (v.) and respond to it 你敢打赌，这个时代的艺术将会反映和回应它. So let's get romantic 让我们浪漫起来 and talk about how Romanticism 浪漫主义 responded to the developments of the age. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now we talked about the emergence 出现；兴起 of _Romanticism 浪漫主义；浪漫精神 way_ back in unit five, but in this period /it's going to come into its full flower. Remember that we talked about how romantic artists rejected (v.)拒绝，驳回；不同意 the cold rationality 理性 of Enlightenment thinking, while simultaneously 同时地 rejecting (v.) the calculated precision 精确性 of neoclassical 新古典主义的 forms of art. Instead, Romanticism *prized* (v.)珍视 the raw emotion 原始情感 and subjectivity 主观性 *as* a higher subject 更高的主题 of artistic expression 艺术表达. +

And *in breaking with* 与……决裂；摒弃；背离 these older forms of art, romantic artists *emphasized* (v.) six themes *as* central to their art form.

The first emphasis was emotion. That way you could see a fresh exuberance (n.)感情洋溢(或慷慨激昂)的言行；(感情等的)过度(或极度)表现 in their works that defied 违抗；挑战 _the cold, hard, predictable lines_ enjoyed by neoclassical art.  +
For example, here's Eugène Delacroix's "Christ  基督 on the Sea of Galilee 加利利（巴勒斯坦北部一多山地区）." You can see that Delacroix 人名 is trading 舍弃、放弃(用A替换B) the almost photorealistic  照相写实主义的；超级现实主义的 precision 超写实精度 of neoclassicism /and tries to convey 传达；表达 the emotion of the scene instead. 德拉克洛瓦​​舍弃了新古典主义近乎照片般的精确性​​，转而试图传达场景的情感。 +

[.my2]
第一个重点是情感。这样，你就能在他们的作品中看到一种新鲜的活力，这种活力与新古典主义艺术中那种冷酷、生硬、可预测的线条截然不同。例如，这是欧格伦·德拉克洛瓦的《加利利海上的基督》你可以看到德拉克洛瓦正在用近乎逼真的新古典主义的精确性来代替，并试图传达场景的情感。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Delacroix is *trading* (v.) the almost photorealistic precision of neoclassicism and tries to convey the emotion of the scene instead.

这里 ​​"trade A for B"​​（用A换B）的句式被简化，隐含的意思是：
​​"Delacroix trades photorealistic precision (A) for emotional expression (B)."​​
即 ​​“德拉克洛瓦用‘精确性’换取了‘情感表达’”​。

类似表达：​​"sacrifice"（牺牲）、"abandon"（放弃）、"replace"（取代）​​。

.Christ on the Sea of Galilee


====

The second romantic emphasis was on nature 大自然. One of the most famous landscape painters of this time was Caspar David Friedrich, and here you can see his "Seashore 海滨；海岸 By Moonlight." And you can almost feel the weight of those clouds on your shoulders.

[.my1]
.案例

.Seashore By Moonlight

====

The third romantic emphasis was on individuality 个性；个人特征. And again, let's consider Friedrich's painting (n.) "Wanderer 流浪者；漫游者 Above 在（或向）较高处；高于  a Sea of Fog." The lone wanderer looks (v.) upon the vast foggy landscape /and *seems* to us *to be equal to* its demands 暗指 ​​大自然（或画中雾海景观）对人类的“挑战”或“压迫感”​​. +

[.my2]
浪漫主义的第三个核心是个体性。让我们再次以弗里德里希的画作《雾海上的流浪者》为例。这位孤独的流浪者凝视着广袤的雾霭笼罩的风景，在我们看来，他仿佛与这片天地势均力敌。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog
image:/img/Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog.jpg[,30%]
====

The fourth emphasis of romantic art was intuition 直觉. This was the idea that `主` a human being `谓` can understand the world immediately /without first reasoning (v.)推理,推论出，推断出 it out.  +
You can see this in lots of artists, but I'll focus on the poet William Wordsworth. His poetry is an ode (n.)颂歌；赞美诗 to the glory 后定说明 hidden in everyday objects -- like a meadow  草地，牧场 or a path or a wildflower or a cliff. Reading his poetry, you get the sense that `主` _the intuitive understanding_ 直觉理解 of the world `系` is far grander 极好的；快乐的；美妙的；出色的 than _the analytical 分析的 understanding_ of the world. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.meadow
image:/img/meadow.jpg[,15%]
====

The fifth emphasis of romantic art was the supernatural (a.n.)超自然的事物. The poet William Blake devoted (v.) nearly all of his poetic work 诗歌作品 to trying to plumb (v.)探索；探究;使垂直 the depths of Heaven and Hell. And he did not do it *in the image of* 以...的方式/模式,遵循...的思想体系 the analytical thinkers like John Calvin or the Puritans, but rather with an emphasis on the feeling of faith.

[.my2]
浪漫主义艺术的第五个核心主题是​​超自然性​​。诗人威廉·布莱克几乎将所有诗作都倾注于探索天堂与地狱的深邃奥秘。然而，他的探索方式既非约翰·加尔文等理性思想家的逻辑推演，亦非清教徒式的教义阐释，而是​​着重于信仰带来的情感震颤​​。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.plumb
plumb line指“铅垂线”，用以量度水深或检测墙壁是否垂直，而plumb则是悬挂于细线上的“铅垂”，它源于拉丁语plumbum‘lead’（铅）。

plumb的派生词plumber指“管子工”，因为管子工的工作是和铅管打交道。

另外，由于plumbline完全或绝对地与水平面相垂直，所以plumb作副词用时就被赋予“完全地”、“绝对地”、“恰恰”等义，常用于plumb mad，plumb crazy，plumb tired这些口头用语中。 短语out of plumb或off plumb用以表示“不垂直的”，也就不难理解了。

plumb还常用作动词，表示“探测”、“查明”，这一用法显然出自于plumb的探测功能。

另一个英语单词plummet也指“铅垂”或“铅垂线”，也出自同一拉丁词源，作动词用时，词义就引申为“骤然跌落”或“垂直落下”。

image:/img/plumb.jpg[,15%]

.He did not do it *in the image of* the analytical thinkers like John Calvin or the Puritans

在原文的语境中，​​"in the image of"​​ 是一个具有宗教渊源的英语短语，这里引申为 ​​"以...的方式/模式"​​ 或 ​​"遵循...的思想体系"​​。


短语源自《圣经·创世纪》"God created (v.) man in his own image"（神照着自己的形象造人），本意为"按照...的形象/样式"。 +
在艺术文化语境中，逐渐演变为 ​​"模仿...的风格"​​ 或 ​​"延续...的传统"​​。

本句中：
​​"in the image of"​​ ≈ ​​"in the manner of"​​（以...的方式）

例​:

- The new cathedral was built _in the image of_ Gothic architecture."  新教堂​​仿照​​哥特式风格建造（此处指建筑风格的延续）
====

And the sixth emphasis of romantic art was national history 民族历史. And not all romantic artists portrayed (v.)描绘；表现 these themes, but there were some 后定说明 deeply inspired by a nationalist sentiment 民族主义情绪 /and sought (v.) to portray (v.)描绘，描写 their national histories _in terms of_ 就……而言；从……角度来看；就……方面而言 emotion and intuition. +

[.my2]
浪漫主义艺术的第六个重点是民族历史。并非所有浪漫主义艺术家都描绘这些主题，但有一些人, 深受民族主义情感的启发，试图从情感和直觉的角度, 来展现本国的历史。

For example, Francisco Goya's "The Third of May 五月三日" depicts (v.)描绘 Spanish rebels being executed 处决 by French forces /in their conflict with Napoleon. This is _a good example_ *not only* _of_ a highly charged (a.)引起强烈感情的，气氛紧张的；充电的，带电的 emotional scene /*but also* romantic artists using (v.) their craft 技艺 *for the sake of* 为了……的利益,目的,原因 glorifying (v.)赞美；颂扬 their national history.

Or you had the Russian composer 创作者，作曲家 Pyotr Tchaikovsky who wrote (v.) symphonies 交响曲 and ballets 芭蕾舞剧 with _interweaving  使交织；使混杂 harmonies_ ( 和声，和弦) 交织的和声 and great variations 变化，变动；变奏曲 of pitch 扔，抛，掷;强度；音准，音高 and volume 音量, which *had a way 特质,能力 of* 有某种独特的能力/方法（达成某种效果） increasing the emotional experience of his audience 这样可以增加听众的情感体验.  +
One of his more famous pieces is the "1812 Overture 前奏曲；提案；序幕," which was written to glorify (v.) the Russians who had successfully held off 抵御；阻挡 Napoleon from his invasion in Russia. +

[.my2]
还有俄罗斯作曲家彼得·柴可夫斯基，他创作的交响曲和芭蕾舞剧, 有着交织的和声，以及音调和音量的巨大变化，这增加了他的听众的情感体验。


However, by the second half of the 19th century, `主` a new art form (n.) known as realism 现实主义 `谓` came to dominate the landscape 形势，情形 Though there is much overlap 重叠；重合 between it and Romanticism, realist artists sought to portray (v.) the world as it was 正如它原来的样子, and more specifically 具体地；具体来说，确切地说 _the world of everyday people_ as it was. 现实主义艺术家试图描绘世界的本来面目，更具体地说，是日常生活的世界的本来面目。  +
And as the "realist" moniker 绰号；名称 suggests, they wanted to portray (v.)  those scenes *as realistically as possible*, which was a kind of rejection 拒绝接受 of romanticism's emphasis on portraying (v.) the world through the lens 透镜，镜片；（相机的）镜头 of emotion. +

[.my2]
然而，到了 19 世纪下半叶，一种被称为"现实主义"的新艺术形式, 开始占据主导地位。尽管它与浪漫主义有很多重叠之处，但现实主义艺术家们力求描绘出真实的世界，更确切地说，是描绘出普通人的日常生活世界。正如“现实主义”这一名称所暗示的那样，他们希望尽可能逼真地描绘这些场景，这在一定程度上是对"浪漫主义通过情感视角来描绘世界的强调"的一种否定。

This movement was begun and led by the French painter Gustave Courbet. Here's his painting titled "The Stone Breakers 碎石者." And you know, it's... it's a couple of 两个（事物）或几个（事物） guys breaking stones. So ordinary (a.)普通的，平常的；平淡无奇的.  +
There was also the French painter Jean-François Millet, whose painting "The Gleaners 拾穗者" portrays (v.) French peasants at their work, but simultaneously 同时地 -- by choosing them as the object （引发某种情感或行为的）对象；客体 of his work -- dignified (v.)使有尊严；使变得崇高 their work in a way that wider society did not. +

[.my2]
这场运动由法国画家古斯塔夫·库尔贝发起并引领。这是他的画作《碎石工》，画的就是……嗯，几个人在敲碎石头，如此平凡。还有法国画家让-弗朗索瓦·米勒，他的作品《拾穗者》描绘了田间劳作的法国农民，但与此同时——通过选择他们作为画作主题——他以一种更广泛的社会所不曾给予的方式，​​赋予了他们的劳作以尊严​​。

And writers also *got in* on the realism party 作家们也加入了现实主义的行列, and you should know a couple. The French writer Honoré de Balzac essentially paved the way for 为……铺平道路 the modern novel. His characters 人物角色 -- even his minor characters -- were both common and complex.  +
And his work influenced the English novelist Charles Dickens, who took _as the subject of many of his stories and novels_ the peasantry 农民阶级 and the working class. Taken as a whole 总的说来, Dickens's world can *be seen as* a critique (n.)批评；批判 of the Industrial Revolution's environmental and social degradation 退化；恶化. +

Now Romanticism and realism *gave way to* 让位于，让步给 the modern art movement around the turn of the century 在世纪之交左右. As the technology of photography 摄影技术 was gaining widespread use, painters *no longer felt (v.) the need* to produce their subjects in realistic fashion, but instead *shifted* (v.) more *to* abstract 抽象的, subjective 主观的 interpretations of their subjects. You can see `主` that pendulum 钟摆 `谓` is always swinging _back and forth_ 来回地，来来回回地，反复地. +

[.my2]
在世纪之交之际，浪漫主义和现实主义, 逐渐让位于现代艺术运动。随着摄影技术的广泛应用，画家们不再觉得有必要以写实的方式, 描绘他们的主题，而是更多地转向对主题的抽象和主观解读。你可以看到这种趋势一直在来回摆动。

Around the late 19th century, impressionism 印象派 began to emerge. This style majored (v.) on 以……为主；专攻 light and color 光与色彩 as the major subjects of its work. Claude Monet's "Haystacks" 干草堆 is a marvelous 非凡的；令人惊叹的 example. You can see that `主` the realism `谓` has disappeared 消失，不见, and instead of 代替，而不是 having a clear sight of the landscape, you have a more emotional response to it -- or one might say an impression 印象，感想 of it 一种瞬间的印象 （双关：既指"印象派"名称由来，又强调​​"瞬时感知"​​的创作理念）.  +
And then came _a reaction to impressionism_ 对印象派的反应, namely post-impressionism 后印象派. There was some overlap 重叠部分 between the two stylistically 在文体上, but post-impressionist artists *moved toward* 朝……移动 a more symbolic 象征的 use (n.) of color and light. +

[.my2]
19世纪末，印象派开始兴起。这一风格以​​光线与色彩​​作为核心表现对象。克劳德·莫奈的《干草堆》便是绝佳范例——你会发现，画中的写实性已然消失，​​风景不再被精确再现​​，取而代之的是一种情感上的共鸣，或者说，一种瞬间的​​印象​​。而后，作为对印象派的反思，后印象派应运而生。两者在风格上虽有重叠，但后印象派艺术家更倾向于将色彩与光线​​符号化​​运用。



The father of this movement was Paul Cézanne, and you could see these emphases in his painting called "Portrait 肖像 of Ambroise Vollard." Under the same heading 在同一标题下, Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night 星夜" is probably one you've seen. This is in no way 决不,一点也不 an accurate representation 描绘，表现 of the scene, but you can feel the movement and the awe 敬畏；惊叹 it provokes 引起；激起 /despite the colors and lines being entirely unrealistic. +

[.my1]

====

But then around the turn of the 20th century, a new form of art arose (v.) called cubism 立体派；立体主义. This movement -- the subject of the paintings became almost nonsensical 无意义的；荒谬的. It was a style that depicted (v.)描绘 three-dimensional objects 三维物体 in two dimensions 二维空间. Pablo Picasso was the most famous of these artists, and here you can see his painting "Woman with a Mustard 芥末酱；芥末黄 Pot (锅；（盛食品的）罐，瓶)芥末瓶." And you can clearly see that /we are getting farther and farther away from the photorealistic 照相写实主义的；超级现实主义的 paintings of the realists 现实主义(者). +

== 中文释义

好的，在这个时期，民族主义、统一和帝国主义占据主导地位，你可以肯定，这个时期的艺术将会反映并回应这些现象。所以，让我们带着浪漫情怀，谈谈浪漫主义如何回应这个时代的发展。如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

我们在第五单元就已经谈到了**浪漫主义**的出现，但**在这个时期，它将全面繁荣。**记住，我们说过"浪漫主义"艺术家拒绝启蒙思想的冷酷理性，同时也拒绝"新古典主义"艺术形式的精于算计的精确性。相反，**浪漫主义珍视"原始情感"和"主观性"，**并将其作为艺术表达的更高主题。  +

在打破这些古老的艺术形式时，**浪漫主义艺术家强调了六个主题，**并将其作为他们艺术形式的核心。**第一个强调的是情感。**从他们的作品中，你可以看到一种全新的活力，这与新古典主义艺术所喜爱的冷酷、坚硬且可预测的线条截然不同。例如，欧仁·德拉克洛瓦（Eugène Delacroix）的《加利利海上的基督》（"Christ on the Sea of Galilee"）。你可以看到，德拉克洛瓦摒弃了"新古典主义"近乎逼真写实的精确性，转而试图传达场景中的情感。  +

浪漫主义强调的**第二个主题是"自然"。**这个时期最著名的风景画家之一是卡斯帕·大卫·弗里德里希（Caspar David Friedrich），在这里你可以看到他的《月光下的海岸》（"Seashore By Moonlight"）。你几乎能感受到那些云朵压在你肩上的重量。

浪漫主义强调的**第三个主题是"个性"。**再以弗里德里希的画作《雾海上的漫步者》（"Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog"）为例。那个孤独的漫步者凝视着广阔的雾景，在我们看来，他与这景的要求是平等的。  +

浪漫主义艺术强调的**第四个主题是"直觉"。**其理念是，人类无需先进行推理, 就能立即理解世界。许多艺术家的作品中都能体现这一点，但我将重点介绍诗人威廉·华兹华斯（William Wordsworth）。他的诗歌是对隐藏在日常事物中的荣耀的颂歌——比如一片草地、一条小路、一朵野花或一座悬崖。读他的诗歌，你会感觉到，对世界的直觉理解, 远比分析性理解更为宏大。  +

浪漫主义艺术强调的**第五个主题是"超自然"。**诗人威廉·布莱克（William Blake）几乎将他所有的诗歌作品, 都用于**探索天堂和地狱的深处。**他不是以像约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）或清教徒那样的分析思想家的形象, 来做这件事，而是强调信仰的感觉。

浪漫主义艺术强调的**第六个主题是"民族历史"。**并非所有浪漫主义艺术家都描绘这些主题，但有些艺术家深受"民族主义情感"的启发，试图从情感和直觉的角度, 描绘他们的民族历史。  +

例如，弗朗西斯科·戈雅（Francisco Goya）的《五月三日》（"The Third of May"）描绘了西班牙叛军在与拿破仑的冲突中, 被法国军队处决的场景。这不仅是一个充满强烈情感的场景的好例子，也是浪漫主义艺术家利用他们的技艺, 来颂扬他们的民族历史的例子。或者看看俄罗斯作曲家彼得·柴可夫斯基（Pyotr Tchaikovsky），他创作的交响乐和芭蕾舞剧交织着和声，音高和音量变化丰富，这能提升观众的情感体验。他的一部比较著名的作品是《1812序曲》（"1812 Overture"），*这部作品是为了颂扬成功抵御拿破仑入侵俄罗斯的俄罗斯人, 而创作的。*  +

**然而，到了19世纪后半叶，一种被称为"现实主义"（realism）的新艺术形式, 开始占据主导地位。**尽管它与浪漫主义有很多重叠之处，但**现实主义艺术家, 试图描绘世界的真实面貌，**更具体地说，是**描绘普通人的世界的真实面貌。**正如“现实主义”这个绰号所暗示的，*他们想要尽可能真实地描绘这些场景，这是对"浪漫主义强调通过情感视角描绘世界"的一种摒弃。*  +

这场运动, 是由法国画家古斯塔夫·库尔贝（Gustave Courbet）发起并引领的。这是他的画作《碎石工》（"The Stone Breakers"）。你知道，画中是几个在碎石的人。非常平凡。还有法国画家让-弗朗索瓦·米勒（Jean-François Millet），他的画作《拾穗者》（"The Gleaners"）描绘了法国农民劳作的场景，但同时，通过选择他们作为作品的对象，他以一种更广泛的社会所没有的方式, 赋予了他们的工作以尊严。  +

作家们也参与到"现实主义"的潮流中，你应该了解几位作家。法国作家奥诺雷·德·巴尔扎克（Honoré de Balzac）从根本上为现代小说铺平了道路。**他作品中的人物——甚至是次要人物——既平凡又复杂。**他的作品影响了英国小说家查尔斯·狄更斯（Charles Dickens），狄更斯以农民和工人阶级作为他许多故事和小说的主题。*从整体上看，狄更斯的作品, 可以被视为对"工业革命导致的环境和社会退化"的批判。*  +

**在世纪之交，浪漫主义和现实主义, 让位于"现代艺术运动"。**随着摄影技术的广泛应用，画家们不再觉得有必要以写实的方式创作他们的主题，而是**更多地转向对主题的抽象、主观的诠释。#你可以看到，这种趋势总是来回摆动(就像钟摆一样, 在理性和感性之间, 来回摆动. 这就是人的"既要又要", 和体现了老子思想的"中庸之道"才不会走极端翻车)。#**  +

在19世纪后期，印象派（impressionism）开始出现。这种风格, 以光和色彩作为其作品的主要主题。克劳德·莫奈（Claude Monet）的《干草堆》（"Haystacks"）就是一个极好的例子。你可以看到，现实主义消失了，人们对风景不再有清晰的视觉认知，而是对它有了更感性的反应——或者可以说，是对它的一种印象。然后出现了对印象派的一种回应，即后印象派（post-impressionism）。在风格上，这两者有一些重叠，但后印象派艺术家更倾向于对色彩和光线, 进行更具象征性的运用。  +

这场运动的先驱, 是保罗·塞尚（Paul Cézanne），你可以在他的画作《安布罗斯·沃拉尔的肖像》（"Portrait of Ambroise Vollard"）中看到这些特点。在同一类别下，文森特·梵高（Vincent van Gogh）的《星夜》（"Starry Night"）可能是你见过的作品。这幅画绝不是对场景的精确描绘，但尽管色彩和线条完全不现实，你仍能感受到其中的动感和它所引发的敬畏之情。  +

Okay, now with all this nationalism and unification and imperialism dominating this period, you bet your sweet bippy that the art of this time is going to reflect and respond to it. So let's get romantic and talk about how Romanticism responded to the developments of the age. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

Now we talked about the emergence of Romanticism way back in unit five, but in this period it's going to come into its full flower. Remember that we talked about how romantic artists rejected the cold rationality of Enlightenment thinking, while simultaneously rejecting the calculated precision of neoclassical forms of art. Instead, Romanticism prized the raw emotion and subjectivity as a higher subject of artistic expression.

And in breaking with these older forms of art, romantic artists emphasized six themes as central to their art form. The first emphasis was emotion. That way you could see a fresh exuberance in their works that defied the cold, hard, predictable lines enjoyed by neoclassical art. For example, here's Eugène Delacroix's "Christ on the Sea of Galilee." You can see that Delacroix is trading the almost photorealistic precision of neoclassicism and tries to convey the emotion of the scene instead.

The second romantic emphasis was on nature. One of the most famous landscape painters of this time was Caspar David Friedrich, and here you can see his "Seashore By Moonlight." And you can almost feel the weight of those clouds on your shoulders. The third romantic emphasis was on individuality. And again, let's consider Friedrich's painting "Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog." The lone wanderer looks upon the vast foggy landscape and seems to us to be equal to its demands.

The fourth emphasis of romantic art was intuition. This was the idea that a human being can understand the world immediately without first reasoning it out. You can see this in lots of artists, but I'll focus on the poet William Wordsworth. His poetry is an ode to the glory hidden in everyday objects -- like a meadow or a path or a wildflower or a cliff. Reading his poetry, you get the sense that the intuitive understanding of the world is far grander than the analytical understanding of the world.

The fifth emphasis of romantic art was the supernatural. The poet William Blake devoted nearly all of his poetic work to trying to plumb the depths of Heaven and Hell. And he did not do it in the image of the analytical thinkers like John Calvin or the Puritans, but rather with an emphasis on the feeling of faith. And the sixth emphasis of romantic art was national history. And not all romantic artists portrayed these themes, but there were some deeply inspired by a nationalist sentiment and sought to portray their national histories in terms of emotion and intuition.

For example, Francisco Goya's "The Third of May" depicts Spanish rebels being executed by French forces in their conflict with Napoleon. This is a good example not only of a highly charged emotional scene but also romantic artists using their craft for the sake of glorifying their national history. Or you had the Russian composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky who wrote symphonies and ballets with interweaving harmonies and great variations of pitch and volume, which had a way of increasing the emotional experience of his audience. One of his more famous pieces is the "1812 Overture," which was written to glorify the Russians who had successfully held off Napoleon from his invasion in Russia.

However, by the second half of the 19th century, a new art form known as realism came to dominate the landscape. Though there is much overlap between it and Romanticism, realist artists sought to portray the world as it was, and more specifically the world of everyday people as it was. And as the "realist" moniker suggests, they wanted to portray those scenes as realistically as possible, which was a kind of rejection of romanticism's emphasis on portraying the world through the lens of emotion.

This movement was begun and led by the French painter Gustave Courbet. Here's his painting titled "The Stone Breakers." And you know, it's... it's a couple of guys breaking stones. So ordinary. There was also the French painter Jean-François Millet, whose painting "The Gleaners" portrays French peasants at their work, but simultaneously -- by choosing them as the object of his work -- dignified their work in a way that wider society did not.

And writers also got in on the realism party, and you should know a couple. The French writer Honoré de Balzac essentially paved the way for the modern novel. His characters -- even his minor characters -- were both common and complex. And his work influenced the English novelist Charles Dickens, who took as the subject of many of his stories and novels the peasantry and the working class. Taken as a whole, Dickens's world can be seen as a critique of the Industrial Revolution's environmental and social degradation.

Now Romanticism and realism gave way to the modern art movement around the turn of the century. As the technology of photography was gaining widespread use, painters no longer felt the need to produce their subjects in realistic fashion, but instead shifted more to abstract, subjective interpretations of their subjects. You can see that pendulum is always swinging back and forth.

Around the late 19th century, impressionism began to emerge. This style majored on light and color as the major subjects of its work. Claude Monet's "Haystacks" is a marvelous example. You can see that the realism has disappeared, and instead of having a clear sight of the landscape, you have a more emotional response to it -- or one might say an impression of it. And then came a reaction to impressionism, namely post-impressionism. There was some overlap between the two stylistically, but post-impressionist artists moved toward a more symbolic use of color and light.

The father of this movement was Paul Cézanne, and you could see these emphases in his painting called "Portrait of Ambroise Vollard." Under the same heading, Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night" is probably one you've seen. This is in no way an accurate representation of the scene, but you can feel the movement and the awe it provokes despite the colors and lines being entirely unrealistic.

But then around the turn of the 20th century, a new form of art arose called cubism. This movement -- the subject of the paintings became almost nonsensical. It was a style that depicted three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. Pablo Picasso was the most famous of these artists, and here you can see his painting "Woman with a Mustard Pot." And you can clearly see that we are getting farther and farther away from the photorealistic paintings of the realists.
