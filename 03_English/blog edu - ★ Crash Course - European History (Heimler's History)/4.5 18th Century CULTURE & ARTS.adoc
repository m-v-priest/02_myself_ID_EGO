== 释义

You know what's weird? It's weird that your parents have their own bedroom, or that you have your own bedroom. You know what else is weird? That you have an opinion about the way things are in the world. Like, we all have a public opinion 公众舆论. And do you know what else is weird? That you invest 投入 at least part of your identity 身份 into things that you buy and the clothes that you wear. +

Now, it wasn't always like that. And here in Unit 4, Topic Five of AP Euro, we're going to find out how that changed. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked （幽默表达，获取知识）, let's get to it. +

Now, as industrialization 工业化 took root （习语，扎根）-- and we'll talk way more about that in the next unit -- the middle classes 中产阶级 and the upper classes 上层阶级 had much more disposable income 可支配收入 than ever before. And the result was increased demand for consumer goods 消费品 that were being manufactured 制造 all over Europe. And this became known as the Consumer Revolution 消费革命. +

People now began buying goods not necessarily 不一定 because they needed them, but because they wanted them. And these goods included porcelain dishes 瓷盘, and cotton and linens 棉麻织物 for home decor 家居装饰, and mirrors 镜子. +

There were some consequences 后果 to this new flurry 一阵热潮 to buy stuff 买东西. First, because these goods were becoming more affordable 负担得起的, the middle class 中产阶级 could purchase 购买 some goods that were previously reserved for （习语，留给；专供）the upper class 上层阶级. And that meant that people were increasingly identifying themselves 认同自己 not merely by their religious affiliation 宗教信仰 or their regional residence 地区居住, but by the things that they bought. And that had the effect of （习语，有……的效果）making the middle class feel a little bit more bougie （俚语，时髦的；高档的）. +

Are the kids saying "bougie" anymore? No? Okay, okay. I'm a 42-year-old bald man. I can't keep up （习语，跟上；赶得上）. +

Second, there was a new concern for privacy 隐私. Now, prior to （习语，在……之前）the Consumer Revolution, homes were smaller and simpler, with only a few rooms in the house. Each room served multiple purposes 多种用途. You know, most people throughout the Middle Ages 中世纪 lived in one-room houses 单间房屋, and the whole family slept together in the same bed. Which, yeah, I'm sure made it awkward 尴尬的 when Mom and Dad... +

Um.

Am I the only one who's getting hung up on this? （习语，被……困扰）+

Anyway, now people began to design homes with more rooms, each of which had its own specific purpose 特定用途. The increasing concern for privacy meant that people were building new kinds of rooms in their houses, such as the boudoir 闺房. This is the room specifically designed for the wife of the house to be apart from her husband 与丈夫分开, either alone or entertaining other women 招待其他女性. +

Now, a third effect of the Consumer Revolution was new venues 场所 for leisure activities 休闲活动. For example, people gathered together 聚集 in coffee houses 咖啡馆. And thanks to the Columbian Exchange 哥伦布大交换, coffee was growing in popularity among Europeans 受到欧洲人欢迎. And they built coffee houses in order to drink. +

In contrast to （习语，与……形成对比）taverns 酒馆, where you got sauced up （俚语，喝醉）and sang loud songs 高声唱歌, coffee houses were open to men of all classes 各阶层男性, and the emphasis was on discussing the revolutionary ideas of the day 当时的革命思想. +

And then, especially in urban areas 城市地区, we can witness 见证 the rise of spectator sports 观赏性体育活动. Some of the most popular were blood sports 血腥的体育活动, which emphasized, you know, blood. And some of the more popular venues 场所 hosted bull baiting 斗牛 and cockfights 斗鸡. +

Now, a subset 子集 of the Consumer Revolution was the Reading Revolution 阅读革命. That's exactly what it sounds like. As literacy 识字率 continued to spread during this period -- thanks in no small part to （习语，在很大程度上归功于）new efforts to educate children 儿童教育 -- and the abundance of printed materials 印刷材料 made available by the printing press 印刷术, more and more people began to read. +

Not only did the amount of books increase, but the kinds of books began to vary 多样化 as well. For example, in France, the number of religious devotional books 宗教虔诚书籍 began to decrease, and books on history, law, science, and the arts began to increase rapidly 迅速增加. +

These reading materials 阅读材料 came in all forms 各种形式. In addition to books, you had newspapers 报纸, and periodicals 期刊, and pamphlets 小册子. And let's not forget the wildly popular Encyclopedia 百科全书 produced by Denis Diderot 德尼·狄德罗. +

But with all these new ideas floating around （习语，四处流传）, and more people exploring ideas outside the bounds of 超出……范围 the Bible 圣经 and religious devotional literature 宗教虔诚文学, censorship 审查制度 increased to keep them in check （习语，控制；抑制）. Mainly, the censors 审查员 were religious. For example, the Catholic Church 天主教会 sanctioned 制裁 Diderot's Encyclopedia for its brazen 大胆的 questioning of religious authority 宗教权威. +

But even with the attempts at censorship, the Reading Revolution took hold （习语，生根；确立）, and people were reading more than ever. +

Okay, now the arts 艺术 also shifted emphasis 转变重点 during this period as well. They shifted from the celebration of religious themes 宗教主题 and royal power 王权 of kings to an emphasis on the private life 私人生活 and public goods 公共利益. +

Remember what we talked about in another video: until about 1750, art in the Baroque style 巴洛克风格 promoted religious feeling 宗教情感. It was employed by （习语，被……使用）monarchs 君主 to illustrate 说明 state power 国家权力. Like, monarchs embraced 接受 Baroque art 巴洛克艺术 and paid for it because it was ostentatious 炫耀的 and made them look powerful 显得强大. +

The church did so as well. Remember how we talked about Gian Lorenzo Bernini's magnificent piazzas 广场, and how he designed ornate chapels 华丽的小教堂 for the renovation 翻新 of Saint Peter's Basilica 圣彼得大教堂 in Rome? +

There was also the composer 作曲家 Johann Sebastian Bach 约翰·塞巴斯蒂安·巴赫, who wrote many of his compositions 作品 to be performed in a royal court 宫廷 or high church service 高级教堂仪式. So all these artists are applying their trade 运用他们的技艺 in service of （习语，为……服务）the church and monarch 君主. +

But in the 18th century, the nature 本质 and subject matter 主题 of art shifted from state and religious themes 国家和宗教主题 to themes that appealed to （习语，吸引）bourgeois society 资产阶级社会. +

Now, what in the fresh heck does "bourgeois" 资产阶级的 mean? I'm not just throwing around （习语，随意使用）weird French terms for funsies. You actually have to know this one. +

So, bourgeois society 资产阶级社会 is essentially 本质上 the middle class 中产阶级, and it emphasizes their materialistic values 物质主义价值观. So art in the 17th and early 18th century in the Baroque style 巴洛克风格 was meant to appeal to bourgeois society 资产阶级社会, whereas now, in the second half of the 18th century, Baroque art was meant to appeal to bourgeois tastes 资产阶级品味. +

A good example of this shift is the work of Rembrandt 伦勃朗. He still painted biblical scenes 圣经场景 -- like you see here in his Storm on the Sea of Galilee 《加利利海上的风暴》-- but compared to the biblical scenes of the High Renaissance 文艺复兴鼎盛时期, you can see that this is way more down-to-earth （习语，务实的；接地气的）. +

But he also depicted 描绘 scenes from everyday life 日常生活场景, like here in this painting called Slaughtered Ox 《被屠宰的牛》. Ain't no king gonna hang that in his bedroom and say, "Ah yes, this pleases me." +

Part of this kind appealed to 吸引 more common folks 普通人. +

== 中文释义

你知道什么很奇怪吗？很奇怪的是你的父母有他们自己的卧室，或者说你有你自己的卧室。你知道还有什么很奇怪吗？那就是你对世界上事物的样子, 有自己的看法。比如，我们都有公众舆论。你知道还有什么很奇怪吗？那就是你会把自己的一部分身份认同, 投入到你购买的东西和你穿的衣服上。  +

现在，事情并不总是这样。在美国大学预修课程欧洲历史的第四单元，第五个主题中，我们将了解这种情况是如何改变的。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

现在，随着工业化扎根——我们将在下一单元更多地谈论这个——*中产阶级和上层阶级, 拥有比以往更多的可支配收入。结果是对在欧洲各地生产的消费品的需求增加。这被称为消费革命。*  +

**人们现在开始购买商品，不一定是因为他们需要(生存需要)这些商品，而是因为他们想要(满足精神需求)这些商品。**这些商品包括瓷盘、用于家居装饰的棉布和亚麻布，以及镜子。  +

这种新的购物热潮, 带来了一些后果。首先，因为这些商品变得更加实惠，中产阶级能够购买一些以前只有上层阶级才能拥有的商品。这意味着人们越来越不仅仅通过他们的宗教归属或居住地区, 来定义自己，而是通过他们购买的东西来定义自己。这使得中产阶级感觉自己更有品味了。  +

现在的孩子们还说“有品味（bougie）”这个词吗？不说了？好吧，好吧。我是一个42岁的秃头男人。我跟不上潮流了。  +

**其次，人们对隐私有了新的关注。**在消费革命之前，房子更小、更简单，房子里只有几个房间。每个房间都有多种用途。你知道，**在中世纪，大多数人住在只有一个房间的房子里，全家人睡在同一张床上。**是啊，我敢肯定，当爸爸妈妈……的时候，会很尴尬。  +

嗯。

难道只有我纠结于这个问题吗？

不管怎样，现在人们开始设计有更多房间的房子，每个房间都有其特定的用途。对隐私日益增长的关注意味着人们在家里建造了新的房间，比如闺房（boudoir）。这是专门为家里的妻子设计的房间，让她可以与丈夫分开，要么独处，要么招待其他女性。  +

现在，消费革命的第三个影响, 是出现了新的休闲活动场所。例如，人们聚集在咖啡馆（coffee houses）里。多亏了哥伦布大交换，咖啡在欧洲人中越来越受欢迎。他们建造咖啡馆是为了喝咖啡。  +

*与酒馆（taverns）不同，在酒馆里人们会喝得酩酊大醉, 并大声唱歌，咖啡馆对各个阶层的男人开放，重点是讨论当时的革命性思想。*  +

然后，尤其是在城市地区，我们可以看到观赏性体育运动的兴起。一些最受欢迎的是血腥运动，你知道，就是强调血腥的运动。一些更受欢迎的场所, 会举办逗公牛和斗鸡活动。  +

现在，**消费革命的一个分支是阅读革命。**这听起来就是字面意思。由于在这个时期识字率不断提高——这在很大程度上要归功于在儿童教育方面的新努力——以及**印刷机带来的大量印刷材料，越来越多的人开始阅读。**  +

不仅书籍的数量增加了，而且书籍的种类也开始多样化。*例如，在法国，宗教虔诚书籍的数量开始减少，关于历史、法律、科学和艺术的书籍数量开始迅速增加。*  +

这些阅读材料有各种形式。除了书籍，还有报纸、期刊和小册子。别忘了狄德罗（Denis Diderot）制作的非常受欢迎的《百科全书》。  +

但是随着所有这些新思想的传播，以及越来越多的人探索《圣经》和宗教虔诚文学之外的思想，"审查制度"加强了，以控制这些思想。主要的审查者是宗教方面的。例如，天主教会制裁了狄德罗的《百科全书》，因为它大胆地质疑了宗教权威。  +

但是，即使有"审查制度"的尝试，阅读革命还是占据了主导，人们的阅读量比以往任何时候都多。  +

好的，*现在艺术在这个时期也改变了重点。艺术从歌颂宗教主题和国王的王权，转向了强调私人生活和公共利益。*  +

还记得我们在另一个视频中谈到的吗：**在大约1750年之前，巴洛克风格（Baroque style）的艺术,促进了宗教情感。**君主们利用它来展示国家权力。比如，君主们接受巴洛克艺术并为此买单，因为它很奢华，能让他们看起来很有权力。  +

教会也是如此。还记得我们谈到吉安·洛伦佐·贝尼尼（Gian Lorenzo Bernini）宏伟的广场，以及他为罗马圣彼得大教堂（Saint Peter's Basilica）的翻新设计的华丽小礼拜堂吗？  +

还有作曲家约翰·塞巴斯蒂安·巴赫（Johann Sebastian Bach），他的许多作品是为在皇家宫廷或高级教堂仪式上演奏, 而创作的。所以所有这些艺术家, 都用他们的技艺为教会和君主服务。  +

*但是在18世纪，艺术的性质和主题, 从国家和宗教主题, 转向了吸引资产阶级社会（也就是中产阶级）的主题。*  +

那么，“资产阶级（bourgeois）”到底是什么意思呢？我可不是为了好玩而随意使用这个奇怪的法语词。实际上你需要了解这个词。  +

所以，**资产阶级社会, 本质上就是中产阶级，它强调他们的"物质主义"价值观。**所以17世纪和18世纪早期的巴洛克风格艺术是为了吸引资产阶级社会，而现在，在18世纪下半叶，巴洛克艺术也是为了迎合资产阶级的品味。  +

这种转变的一个很好的例子是伦勃朗（Rembrandt）的作品。他仍然描绘圣经场景——就像你在他的《加利利海上的风暴》中看到的那样——但是与文艺复兴鼎盛时期的圣经场景相比，你可以看到这个场景更加接地气。  +

但他也描绘日常生活场景，比如在这幅名为《被屠宰的牛》的画作中。没有哪个国王会把这幅画挂在他的卧室里然后说：“啊，是的，这幅画让我很满意。”  +

这种艺术的一部分吸引了更多的普通人。  +

后来，一种新的艺术运动兴起，被称为"新古典主义"（Neoclassicism）。*#与巴洛克风格的奢华和宏伟形成对比，"新古典主义"艺术家推崇简洁和对称。#*  +

例如，考虑由雅克 - 日耳曼·苏夫洛（Jacques-Germain Soufflot）以"新古典主义"风格建造的巴黎万神殿（Panthéon）。虽然它是受路易十五（Louis XV）委托建造的，但由于其简洁和对称，它是新古典主义的一个例子。  +

现在，文学也改变了重点，开始关注启蒙运动, 和资产阶级社会的商业价值观。  +

例如，丹尼尔·笛福（Daniel Defoe）的小说《鲁滨逊漂流记》（Robinson Crusoe），讲述了一个人在岛上遭遇海难后, 学会生存和繁荣的故事。而且他在没有"宗教权威"或"基督教教义"指导的情况下, 做到了这一点。我是说，你能想象吗？  +

或者想想歌德（Goethe）的戏剧《浮士德》（Faust），讲述了一个人为了获得秘密知识和大量财富, 而把自己的灵魂卖给魔鬼的故事。这部戏剧的主要主题是人类对"意义"的渴望——资产阶级社会越来越能感受到这种渴望。  +

And that had the effect of making the middle class feel a little bit more bougie.

This is the room specifically designed for the wife of the house to be apart from her husband, either alone or entertaining other women.

And then, especially in urban areas, we can witness the rise of spectator sports. Some of the most popular were blood sports, which emphasized, you know, blood. And some of the more popular venues hosted bull baiting and cockfights.

Now, a subset of the Consumer Revolution was the Reading Revolution. That's exactly what it sounds like. As literacy continued to spread during this period -- thanks in no small part to new efforts to educate children -- and the abundance of printed materials made available by the printing press, more and more people began to read.

Not only did the amount of books increase, but the kinds of books began to vary as well. For example, in France, the number of religious devotional books began to decrease, and books on history, law, science, and the arts began to increase rapidly.

These reading materials came in all forms. In addition to books, you had newspapers, and periodicals, and pamphlets. And let's not forget the wildly popular Encyclopedia produced by Denis Diderot.

But with all these new ideas floating around, and more people exploring ideas outside the bounds of the Bible and religious devotional literature, censorship increased to keep them in check. Mainly, the censors were religious. For example, the Catholic Church sanctioned Diderot's Encyclopedia for its brazen questioning of religious authority.

But even with the attempts at censorship, the Reading Revolution took hold, and people were reading more than ever.

Okay, now the arts also shifted emphasis during this period as well. They shifted from the celebration of religious themes and royal power of kings to an emphasis on the private life and public goods.

Remember what we talked about in another video: until about 1750, art in the Baroque style promoted religious feeling. It was employed by monarchs to illustrate state power. Like, monarchs embraced Baroque art and paid for it because it was ostentatious and made them look powerful.

The church did so as well. Remember how we talked about Gian Lorenzo Bernini's magnificent piazzas, and how he designed ornate chapels for the renovation of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome?

There was also the composer Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote many of his compositions to be performed in a royal court or high church service. So all these artists are applying their trade in service of the church and monarch.

But in the 18th century, the nature and subject matter of art shifted from state and religious themes to themes that appealed to bourgeois society.

Now, what in the fresh heck does "bourgeois" mean? I'm not just throwing around weird French terms for funsies. You actually have to know this one.

So, bourgeois society is essentially the middle class, and it emphasizes their materialistic values. So art in the 17th and early 18th century in the Baroque style was meant to appeal to bourgeois society, whereas now, in the second half of the 18th century, Baroque art was meant to appeal to bourgeois tastes.

A good example of this shift is the work of Rembrandt. He still painted biblical scenes -- like you see here in his Storm on the Sea of Galilee -- but compared to the biblical scenes of the High Renaissance, you can see that this is way more down-to-earth.

But he also depicted scenes from everyday life, like here in this painting called Slaughtered Ox. Ain't no king gonna hang that in his bedroom and say, "Ah yes, this pleases me."

Part of this kind appealed to more common folks.

Now, later on, a new artistic movement arose known as Neoclassicism. And in contrast to the opulence and grandeur of Baroque, Neoclassical artists prized simplicity and symmetry.

For example, consider the Panthéon in Paris, built in the Neoclassical style by Jacques-Germain Soufflot. Although it was commissioned by Louis XV, it is an example of Neoclassicism because of its simplicity and symmetry.

Now, literature also shifted emphasis to focus on the Enlightenment and commercial values of bourgeois society as well.

For example, you had Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe, which was the story of a man shipwrecked on an island who learns to survive and thrive. And he does all of this without any guidance from religious authority or Christian doctrines. I mean, can you imagine?

Or consider Goethe's play Faust, which is about a man who sells his soul to the devil in order to attain secret knowledge and abundant wealth. And the main theme of that play is the human yearning for meaning -- a yearning that was increasingly felt by bourgeois society.
