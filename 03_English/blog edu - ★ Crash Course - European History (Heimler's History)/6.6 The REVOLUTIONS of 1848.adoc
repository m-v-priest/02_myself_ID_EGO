Let's consider the Greek War of Independence, which began in 1821. Greece was ruled by the Ottomans in the first part 上半叶 of the 19th century, and the Ottomans were very much a conservative 保守的 government. And so for 11 years starting (v.) in 1821 所以从1821年开始的11年里, Greek nationalists 民族主义者 engaged in 参与；从事 a series of rebellions 叛乱 in order to gain their independence. +

And just to remind you, nationalism 民族主义 is the desire of a group of people *to have* their own nation *defined* by their own language and shared (v.) cultural and historical heritage 遗产；传统.

But eventually Britain, France, and Russia allied with 与…结盟 the Greeks /and helped them win their war against the Ottomans.

Anyway, Greece won (v.) their independence in 1832, and this was the first rumble  持续而低沉的声音，震动；隆隆声 that foreshadowed (v.)预示；预兆 the storm of 1848. +

Then there was the Decembrist 十二月党人 Revolt 十二月党人起义 in Russia in December of 1825. _Tsar Nicholas the First_ rose to power 掌权 in Russia.

And so /with this change in the throne 随着王位的更替, `主` a group of Russian officers /who came to be known as the Decembrists -- who were influenced by liberal 自由的 ideals 理想 -- `谓` attempted a coup 政变. But unfortunately for them, Nicholas's forces  势力；武装力量 proved (v.) superior 占优势的；更好的, and the revolt 起义 was quickly crushed. +

But don't worry -- *in response to* this rebellion 叛乱, Nicholas grew even more *desirous (a.)想要的，渴望的 of* 渴望 crush**ing** dissent 异议 /and significantly increased his use of the secret police to do so. +

Then came _the July Revolution_ in France. _Charles the Tenth_ 查理十世 was an extremely conservative (a.) monarch 君主 who wanted *to bring* France *back to* its pre-French Revolution structure 法国大革命前的结构. So *to that end* 为了那个目的, in July of 1830 /he *stripped* 剥夺 much of the middle class *of* voting rights /and made efforts to censor (v.)审查；检查 the press. +

.Workhouse
在英国和爱尔兰， 济贫院 （ 威尔士语 ： tloty ， 字面意思是“贫民院”）是一种**为经济无力自给自足的人提供住宿和就业机会的机构 。**在苏格兰，济贫院通常被称为 “poorhouse”（救济院） 。

济贫院的起源, 可以追溯到 1388 年的《剑桥法令》 ，**该法令试图通过限制劳动力流动, 来解决英国黑死病之后的劳动力短缺问题，并最终导致国家承担起扶持穷人的责任。** +
然而，1815 年拿破仑战争结束后的大规模失业、新技术的引进（尤其是取代农业工人）, 以及一系列的歉收, 意味着到 19 世纪 30 年代初，既定的济贫体系已不可持续。 +

1834 年的新济贫法, 试图通过阻止向任何拒绝进入济贫院的人提供救济, 来扭转经济趋势。**一些济贫法当局希望, 通过利用济贫院囚犯的免费劳动力, 来盈利。**大多数济贫院囚犯被雇来做诸如砸石头、压碎骨头生产肥料, 或用一种被称为大钉子的金属钉子挑麻絮之类的工作。

随着 19 世纪的流逝，**济贫院逐渐沦为老年人、体弱者和病人的避难所，而非健全的穷人的庇护所。**

直到 1948 年《国家援助法》 的出台，《济贫法》的最后残余才最终消失，济贫院也随之消失。

The result was a spontaneous 自发的 uprising 起义 in the streets. And while the military was contending (v.)竞争；争夺 with （不得不）处理问题，对付困境;与…斗争 them, the National Assembly completed a new constitution which provided for 规定；提供 a strong executive 行政部门. And to that office /they elected Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew 侄子，外甥, who _in short order_ 迅速地；迅捷地；快速地;立即；马上 crowned (v.)为……加冕 himself Emperor Napoleon III. +

So the revolution in France in 1848 was deemed (v.)认为；视为 a failure. +

But this revolutionary spirit also erupted 爆发 in the German states as well. Inspired by what they saw in France, revolutionaries 革命者 in Prussia and other German states began to demand (v.) more liberal 自由的 reforms as well, including constitutional 宪法的；章程的 reforms and voting rights -- but most of all, the unification 统一 of the German states. +

Now the heat of this revolution was turned (v.) _up to_ 直到 its hottest in Prussia, who remember 别忘了,要知道 was the strongest of the German states. The King of Prussia, Frederick William IV, suppressed (v.)镇压；压制 the revolution with force /but agreed to make some of the reforms the liberals demanded. +

[.my2]
这场革命的热度在普鲁士达到了顶峰，普鲁士是德意志诸国中最强大的。

So delegates 代表 from the German states *got together* in the Frankfurt 法兰克福市（德国城市） Assembly /and drafted (v.)起草 a new constitution that would unify (v.)统一 the German states. However, the conservative monarchy 君主制；君主政体 was able to *divide* (v.)隔开；使产生分歧 the delegates *along* class and party lines, so they were unable to come to any significant decision. +

[.my2]
然而，保守的君主势力利用阶级和党派分歧, 分化代表，导致议会最终未能达成任何实质性决议。


And _at that_ ​就在那个情况下, Frederick William refused to accept the Frankfurt Constitution /and crushed 镇压；消灭 the remaining 剩下的 protests 抗议，反对. +

And then the revolution *took hold* 抓住，握紧;扎根；固定下来 in Austria  奥地利 as well. The Austrian Empire was home to many different ethnic 民族的；种族的 groups, `主` all of whom, taken by a wave of nationalism, `谓` *longed (v.) for* 渴望 the right of self-rule 自治权. +

Long story short 长话短说, these various groups revolted (v.)（对权威、规定、法律的）反抗，违抗；叛乱，造反 for different reasons, but with Russia's help /Austria was able to defeat them. +

So the point is, during the Revolutions of 1848 /we see a widespread 广泛的 rebellion 叛乱；反抗 against the conservative _status quo_ 现状. At the same time, those revolutions failed, and in the states where they occurred /`主` the response `谓` often involved an increase (n.) in conservative measures. +

[.my2]
与此同时，这些革命失败了，在发生革命的国家，人们的反应往往是采取更多的保守措施。

During this time, Russia began to experience (v.) similar rumblings 震动；传言；传闻；谣传, but their revolution -- which didn't occur until 1905 -- had a different result. +

== 中文释义

所以**#在欧洲历史的这个时期，我们处于"梅特涅时代"，这意味着几乎整个欧洲, 都受到了保守主义的影响。到1848年，欧洲各地的革命将会兴起，挑战这种保守主义，#**而这就是这个视频的内容。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

要记住，由克莱门斯·冯·梅特涅（Clemens von Metternich）在1815年策划的"欧洲协调"，使得欧洲各地保守主义政府纷纷涌现。*保守派领导人厌倦了因人们对"自由改革"的要求而引发的混乱和暴力，所以在最终击败拿破仑后，梅特涅和在"维也纳会议"上与他结盟的领导人, 试图逆转那些改革。*  +

然而，**问题在于，并不是欧洲的每个人, 都对梅特涅毫不客气地强加在欧洲大陆上的这股保守主义浪潮感到兴奋。而这种不满最终在1848年爆发了。**但在19世纪早期，这种不满就已经有了端倪，我认为我们应该先谈谈这些。  +

让我们来看看"希腊独立战争"（Greek War of Independence），它始于1821年。*在19世纪的前半叶，希腊被奥斯曼帝国（Ottomans）统治，而奥斯曼帝国是一个非常保守的政府。所以从1821年开始的11年里，希腊民族主义者发动了一系列叛乱，以争取独立。*  +

提醒一下，民族主义是一群人渴望拥有一个"由他们自己的语言以及共享的文化和历史遗产, 所定义的国家"的愿望。说实话，希腊人根本不是庞大的奥斯曼帝国的对手，一开始奥斯曼人把希腊人打得落花流水。  +

但最终，英国、法国和俄罗斯与希腊结盟，帮助他们打赢了对奥斯曼帝国的战争。*##就像##我们在这门课程中考虑过的##几乎每一场战争一样，英国、法国和俄罗斯帮助希腊, 并不是因为他们多么关心希腊人——不，他们看到了削弱他们共同的敌人奥斯曼帝国的机会，并抓住了这个机会 (自己的实际利益, 大于意识形态的考量. 正如美国对台湾的扶持, 并不是纯粹为了维护民主阵营, 而是为了抑制中国)。##*  +

不管怎样，希腊在1832年赢得了独立，这是预示着1848年风暴的第一声轰鸣。  +

然后是1825年俄罗斯的十二月党人起义（Decembrist Revolt）。沙皇尼古拉一世（Tsar Nicholas the First）在俄罗斯掌权。尼古拉从他的哥哥亚历山大一世（Alexander the First）那里继承了王位，而亚历山大在其统治后期变得越来越保守。  +

随着王位的更迭，**一群被称为十二月党人的俄罗斯军官——他们受到了自由理想的影响——试图发动政变。**但对他们来说不幸的是，尼古拉的军队实力更强，起义很快就被镇压了。  +

但别担心——作为对这次叛乱的回应，尼古拉更加渴望镇压异见，并且大幅增加了对秘密警察的使用来达到这个目的。  +

接着是法国的七月革命（July Revolution）。**查理十世（Charles the Tenth）是一位极其保守的君主，他想让法国回到"法国大革命"前的结构。**所以为了实现这个目标，在1830年7月，*他剥夺了中产阶级的许多投票权，并努力审查新闻媒体。*  +

**作为回应，中产阶级的自由主义者和工人阶级的人们, 涌上首都的街头，发动了起义。**三天里，街头发生了骚乱和战斗，当查理十世清楚自己处于危险之中时，他逃走了，并退位。  +

然后路易·菲利普（Louis Philippe）继位，他恢复了查理十世剥夺的一些权利，但除此之外，他几乎和他的前任一样保守。  +

所以这就是1848年之前欧洲大陆的局势。但现在我们来看看这一年，欧洲各地同时爆发了革命。  +

**1848年的革命始于法国。由于路易·菲利普维持着保守的现状，许多人开始要求建立一个更加自由的政府。**接着出现了面包短缺的情况，这让人们更加愤怒。  +

他们走上街头，国王则用军事力量进行回应，杀死了大约50人。作为回应，巴黎人涌上街头，建造了大量的街垒来保护自己。*在冲突结束时，路易·菲利普退位，一个临时政府恢复了"法兰西共和国"，并颁布了人民所要求的自由条款。*  +

*然而，在这个临时政府内部，阶级分歧几乎立刻就削弱了它。其中一个主要的分歧是"自由主义者"和"社会主义者"在贫困问题上的分歧。*  +

社会主义者推动建立由政府资助的济贫院，为失业者提供就业机会，由于他们的努力，法国各地建立了许多这样的济贫院。但在下一次选举中，大多数中产阶级男性当选为"国民议会"成员，他们关闭了大部分济贫院。  +

结果是街头自发的起义。*当军队与起义者对峙时，"国民议会"完成了一部新宪法，规定了一个强大的行政机构。他们选举拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoleon Bonaparte）的侄子担任这个职位，他很快就加冕成为拿破仑三世*（Emperor Napoleon III）。  +

*#所以1848年法国的革命, 被认为是失败的。#*  +

但这种革命精神也在德意志各邦爆发了。*受到法国革命的启发，普鲁士（Prussia）和其他德意志各邦的革命者, 也开始要求更多的自由改革，包括"宪法改革"和"投票权"——但最重要的是，德意志各邦的统一。*  +

现在，这场革命的热度在普鲁士达到了顶峰，要记住，普鲁士是德意志各邦中最强大的。普鲁士国王腓特烈·威廉四世（Frederick William IV）用武力镇压了革命，但同意进行一些自由主义者要求的改革。  +

所以**德意志各邦的代表们在法兰克福议会（Frankfurt Assembly）相聚，并起草了一部新宪法，旨在统一德意志各邦。然而，保守的君主制能够按照阶级和党派分歧分化代表们，所以他们无法做出任何重大决定。**  +

在这种情况下，腓特烈·威廉拒绝接受《法兰克福宪法》，并镇压了剩余的抗议活动。  +

然后**革命也在奥地利爆发了。奥地利帝国（Austrian Empire）是许多不同民族的家园，所有这些民族都受到"民族主义"浪潮的影响，渴望"自治权"。**  +

长话短说，这些不同的群体, 因不同的原因发动了起义，但在俄罗斯的帮助下，奥地利能够击败他们。  +

所以重点是，**在1848年的革命中，我们看到了对保守现状的广泛反抗。与此同时，这些革命失败了，**在发生革命的国家，回应往往是增加保守措施。  +

在这个时期，俄罗斯也开始出现类似的动荡，但他们的革命——直到1905年才发生——有不同的结果。  +

抱歉，亚历山大二世（Alexander II）是沙皇，他意识到俄罗斯在克里米亚战争（Crimean War）中的失败，认为俄罗斯必须进行变革。为此，亚历山大二世颁布了一些有力的自由改革措施。  +

通过这些改革，他解放了俄罗斯的农奴，建立了一个独立的法庭，确保俄罗斯公民在法律面前平等。他还通过提高俄罗斯的工业能力, 使俄罗斯的军事现代化。  +

但亚历山大二世后来被暗杀了，他的继任者亚历山大三世（Alexander III）对"自由改革"不感兴趣。然而，他对俄罗斯的强大很感兴趣，因此在俄罗斯的工业化方面取得了进展。  +

亚历山大的财政大臣谢尔盖·维特（Sergei Witte）通过颁布"保护性关税"来促进国内消费，使俄罗斯的经济现代化，并将俄罗斯货币置于金本位制之下。  +

**俄罗斯人**欣赏更好的经济，但许多人仍然生活在专制沙皇的统治下，处于赤贫状态，这导致了1905年的革命。  +

*他们要求建立一个更加自由的政府，在压力下，亚历山大任命维特起草一些改革措施，这些措施被编纂成《十月宣言》（October Manifesto），其中包括：男性公民的普选权、言论自由以及一个名为杜马（Duma）的代表机构。*  +

*即便如此，沙皇仍然保留了对任何法律的绝对否决权，并最终逆转了宣言中确立的一些改革措施。*  +

So we're in the Age of Metternich during this period of European history, and that means dang near all of Europe has fallen under the influence of conservatism. By 1848, revolutions across Europe will rise to challenge that conservatism, and that's what this video is all about. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

Now remember that the Concert of Europe, which was engineered by Clemens von Metternich in 1815, led to a surge of conservative governments across Europe. Conservative leaders were tired of the chaos and violence that arose because of people's demands for liberal reforms, and so having defeated Napoleon at last, Metternich and the leaders aligned with him at the Congress of Vienna sought to roll back those reforms.

The problem was, however, that not everyone in Europe was stoked about this conservative tsunami that Metternich had so unceremoniously laid upon the continent. And that discontent will eventually erupt in 1848. But there are rumblings of this discontent early in the 19th century as well, and I reckon we ought to talk about them first.

Let's consider the Greek War of Independence, which began in 1821. Greece was ruled by the Ottomans in the first part of the 19th century, and the Ottomans were very much a conservative government. And so for 11 years starting in 1821, Greek nationalists engaged in a series of rebellions in order to gain their independence.

And just to remind you, nationalism is the desire of a group of people to have their own nation defined by their own language and shared cultural and historical heritage. Now the Greeks were, to be honest, no match for the massive Ottoman Empire, and in the beginning the Ottomans mopped the floor with the Greeks.

But eventually Britain, France, and Russia allied with the Greeks and helped them win their war against the Ottomans. As with almost every war we've considered so far in this course, Britain, France, and Russia did not help the Greeks because they cared so much about the Greeks -- no, they saw an opportunity to weaken their shared enemy, the Ottoman Empire, and took it.

Anyway, Greece won their independence in 1832, and this was the first rumble that foreshadowed the storm of 1848.

Then there was the Decembrist Revolt in Russia in December of 1825. Tsar Nicholas the First rose to power in Russia. Now Nicholas inherited the throne from his brother Alexander the First, and Alexander had grown increasingly conservative later in his rule.

And so with this change in the throne, a group of Russian officers who came to be known as the Decembrists -- who were influenced by liberal ideals -- attempted a coup. But unfortunately for them, Nicholas's forces proved superior, and the revolt was quickly crushed.

But don't worry -- in response to this rebellion, Nicholas grew even more desirous of crushing dissent and significantly increased his use of the secret police to do so.

Then came the July Revolution in France. Charles the Tenth was an extremely conservative monarch who wanted to bring France back to its pre-French Revolution structure. So to that end, in July of 1830 he stripped much of the middle class of voting rights and made efforts to censor the press.

In response, middle-class liberals and working-class folks flooded the capital streets and staged an insurrection. For three days there was rioting and fighting in the streets, and when it was clear that he was endangered, Charles the Tenth fled, abdicating his throne.

And then in his place came Louis Philippe, and he did restore some of what Charles took away, but other than that he was kind of just as conservative as his predecessor.

So that's the mood of the continent in the years before 1848. But now we turn to that year which saw simultaneous revolutions springing up across Europe.

The Revolutions of 1848 began in France. With Louis Philippe maintaining the conservative status quo, many people began demanding a more liberal government. Then there was a bread shortage which got people fired up even more.

They took to the streets, and the king responded with military force, killing about 50 of them. In response, Parisians flooded the streets and built massive barricades for protection. At the end of the skirmish, Louis Philippe abdicated the throne, and a provisional government restored the French Republic and enacted liberal provisions demanded by the people.

However, within this provisional government, class division began to weaken it almost immediately. One of the major disagreements was between the liberals and the socialists concerning the poor.

The socialists pushed for government-sponsored workhouses which would give employment to those out of work, and as a result of their efforts many of these were established across France. But in the next election, a majority of middle-class men were elected to the National Assembly, and they shut down most of those workhouses.

The result was a spontaneous uprising in the streets. And while the military was contending with them, the National Assembly completed a new constitution which provided for a strong executive. And to that office they elected Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew, who in short order crowned himself Emperor Napoleon III.

So the revolution in France in 1848 was deemed a failure.

But this revolutionary spirit also erupted in the German states as well. Inspired by what they saw in France, revolutionaries in Prussia and other German states began to demand more liberal reforms as well, including constitutional reforms and voting rights -- but most of all, the unification of the German states.

Now the heat of this revolution was turned up to its hottest in Prussia, who remember was the strongest of the German states. The King of Prussia, Frederick William IV, suppressed the revolution with force but agreed to make some of the reforms the liberals demanded.

So delegates from the German states got together in the Frankfurt Assembly and drafted a new constitution that would unify the German states. However, the conservative monarchy was able to divide the delegates along class and party lines, so they were unable to come to any significant decision.

And at that, Frederick William refused to accept the Frankfurt Constitution and crushed the remaining protests.

And then the revolution took hold in Austria as well. The Austrian Empire was home to many different ethnic groups, all of whom, taken by a wave of nationalism, longed for the right of self-rule.

Long story short, these various groups revolted for different reasons, but with Russia's help Austria was able to defeat them.

So the point is, during the Revolutions of 1848 we see a widespread rebellion against the conservative status quo. At the same time, those revolutions failed, and in the states where they occurred the response often involved an increase in conservative measures.

During this time, Russia began to experience similar rumblings, but their revolution -- which didn't occur until 1905 -- had a different result.

Sorry, Alexander II was the tsar that Russia's loss in the Crimean War and realized that Russia had to transform itself. To this end, Alexander enacted some potent liberal reforms.

In doing so, he emancipated the serfs of Russia, created an independent court which ensured the equality of Russian citizens before the law. He also modernized Russia's military by increasing Russia's industrial capacity.

But Alexander II went ahead and got himself assassinated, and his successor Alexander III was not interested in liberal reform. However, he was interested in Russian greatness and therefore made gains on industrializing Russia.

Alexander's finance minister, Sergei Witte, modernized Russia's economy by enacting protective tariffs to boost domestic purchases and placed the Russian currency on the gold standard.

Now Russians appreciated a better economy, but many of them were still living in absolute poverty under an authoritarian tsar, and that led them to the revolution of 1905.

They demanded a more liberal government, and under pressure Alexander appointed Witte to draft some reforms which were codified in the October Manifesto, which included the following: universal suffrage for male citizens, freedom of speech, and a representative body called the Duma.

Even so, the tsar retained the absolute right to veto any law and eventually rolled back some of the reforms established in the manifesto.
