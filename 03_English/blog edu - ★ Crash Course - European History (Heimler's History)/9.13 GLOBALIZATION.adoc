== 释义

Okay, starting in the last decades of the 20th century, Europe essentially became globalized 全球化的 in its economy and society, and I reckon 认为 we ought to talk about how that happened /and what that means. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Okay, now globalization 全球化 is a word /that describes the increasing economic, political, and social interconnectedness (n.)互联性;相互关联；相互依存 of the world. And as you know, this phenomenon 现象 didn't begin during this period. In terms of 就……而言,从……角度来看 European history, some iteration 迭代；版本 of globalization had been occurring /since the beginning of this course  课程；过程；道路 /with the first wave of imperialism 帝国主义. But in the 20th and 21st centuries, globalization became more widespread, and `主` the process /by which  *it occurred* (v.) 借助这个过程,全球化发生了 /`谓` was happening _at a much greater speed_ than it ever had before. 其发生的过程比以往任何时候都要快得多。 And there are three reasons for this. +

First was the proliferation 激增；扩散 of _multinational corporations_ 跨国公司. Now by definition, a multinational corporation is an entity 实体 which is incorporated (v.)组成公司,注册成立 in one country /but *manufactures (v.)（用机器）大量生产，成批制造 and sells (v.) goods* in other countries. And the architecture 架构 of these corporations is _as follows_ 如下所示: the corporations employ (v.) _knowledge workers_ 知识工作者 in their own countries, *manufacture (v.)（用机器大量）生产，制造 goods* for sale in other countries, and then sell (v.) those goods on a global market 全球市场.  +
A good example of a multinational corporation is Nestlé 雀巢. This company is headquartered (v.)总部设在 in Switzerland, purchases (v.)购买；进货 and manufactures (v.) their chocolate 巧克力  with low-wage work in West Africa -- and _in some cases_ child and _enslaved labor_ 童工和奴役劳动 -- and sells (v.) their _glorious 光辉的、令人愉悦的 treats_ (n.)乐事；乐趣；款待 on the world market. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.glorious treats
"glorious"​​： 光辉的、令人愉悦的 +
"treats"​​： 美味零食（特指巧克力等甜食）

但词典中, treats 好像没有零食的意思? +
​​“treats”​​ 这个词是英语中一个典型的​​"通过语境赋予特定含义"​​的例子。
在传统词典中，​​“treat”​​ 作为名词的核心含义确实是 ​​“款待，请客；乐事”​​，指一件让人感到愉悦或特别的事情。 +
然而，在这个具体的句子中，​​“treats”​​ 的含义通过上下文被​​具体化和缩小​​了。

词义的具体化 (Semantic Narrowing):​​ +
​​**“Treat”​​ 的本义是广义的“令人开心的事物”。它可以指一顿大餐、一次旅行、一件礼物，**当然也可以指​​一块巧克力​​。 +
​​*在特定语境中​​：当整个段落都在讨论巧克力（chocolate）的生产和销售时，treats 的指代范围就立刻被缩小了。读者能清晰地意识到，这里的 treats 就是指前文提到的 ​​“巧克力制品”​​。*

​​中文的类似现象​​：就像中文说“好吃的”，在讨论零食的语境下，它自然就是指“零食”，而不需要每次都说出“零食”这个词。 +

​​所以，在这个句子里，treats = sweet food products (specifically, chocolate products)，即“甜食，零食（特指巧克力产品）”。​

Now `主` the second reason /globalization occurred (v.) so rapidly in the late 20th century /`系` was the rise of international governing bodies 国际管理机构. Here you can think about _the European Union_ or the United Nations. These bodies often enact (v.)制定；颁布 policies /that *are made* _for a global community_  社区，社会;（多个国家的）共同体 *over policies* /that would benefit (v.) a single state.

[.my2]
这些机构制定的政策, 通常是为全球共同体服务的，而非仅仅为了某个单一国家的利益。


And the third reason /globalization occurred so rapidly in the 20th century /`系` was the rapid rise of communication 交流,通讯 and transportation 运输，运送 technologies 通信和运输技术. And for that, let's move on to the next point. +

So `主` new communication and transportation technologies `谓` multiplied (v.) connections _across time and space_ 跨越时空. For example, the telephone increasingly connected (v.) people in distant locations. This kind of technology also made migration and immigration more palatable 宜人的；可意的；可接受的;可口的；味美的, since `主` those who moved away 已搬走 `谓` could easily stay (v.) _in contact with_ 与……接触 their families back home.  +

And during the 1930s, the radio *rose to prominence* 变得突出, and during the 1950s, the television. And the television especially democratized (v.)使民主化;使大众化；使普及 entertainment 娱乐. Prior to this, if people wanted to see moving pictures, they went to the theater, and _in general_ because it was expensive, this was an elite activity 精英活动. However, with the decreasing （使）减少，（使）降低 cost of the television throughout the 50s and 60s, more and more the average people could watch (v.) television programming 电视节目 in their homes. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.palatable
(a.) 1.( of food or drink食物或饮料 ) having a pleasant or acceptable taste 可口的；味美的

2.~ (to sb) : pleasant or acceptable to sb 宜人的；可意的；可接受的 +
•Some of the dialogue has been changed /to make it more palatable to an American audience. 有些对白, 有所修改, 以适应美国观众的口味。

-> #来自palate,腭，可口。#

But what does that *have to do with* globalization? Well, especially in the beginning, much of the programming came from the United States, and *I'll talk more about that* in a moment 我一会儿会详细讲这个.

Then in the late 90s and early 2000s, `主` the rise of the internet `谓` *connected (v.) the world* in a way /that had never been seen before. People could *log (v.)把…载入正式记录；记录 on to* 登录 the World Wide Web 万维网 through those newfangled (a.)新奇的;新奇怪异的；时髦复杂的 devices called computers, and the entire world was open to them. This meant that /ideas from all over the world could influence  (v.) people. And with the rise of online retailers 在线零售商 like Amazon.com, commerce 贸易，商业 increased (v.) rapidly as well. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.newfangled
-> ##new,新的，fang,牙齿，咬。##引申词义##咬住最新的，与时俱进的，新奇时髦的。##
====

Now as I say /in about every video, that all sounds (v.) really great, right? But there were some objections 反对意见 to these new communication technologies.  +

And in Europe, one of the main gripes 抱怨 was that /much of their entertainment was being imported (v.) from the United States. This was done in the 1930s /mainly through the export of American movies, and then /as the television was adopted (v.)收养；领养 in more and more homes /through the 50s and the 60s, this was done through television programs.  +
American media producers *sold* (v.) their shows *to* European broadcasters 广播公司 /for _a fraction 小部分，微量 of_ what it would cost (v.) them to produce (v.) the programs on their own. 美国的媒体制作人将他们的节目卖给欧洲的广播公司，价格只是他们自己制作节目的一小部分。 This seemed like a good thing -- like _after all_ 毕竟, people really liked (v.) these shows -- so what's the problem?  +
The problem is that /entertainment is not neutral 中立的. Every movie or television show `谓` is written according to _the values 后定说明 that culture holds_ 每一部电影或电视节目,都是根据文化所持有的价值观编写的, and so /as Europeans were digesting (v.)吸收 American entertainment by the metric buttload, they were also metabolizing (v.)新陈代谢（将食物、矿物质等通过化学过程转换成新细胞、能量和废料）;吸收；接受 American values /that in some cases were contradictory (a.)相互矛盾的，对立的 to 与……矛盾 their own. So this tension 紧张关系 grew (v.) *between* enthusiasm 热情 for new technology *and* criticism 批评 against this kind of American imperialism 帝国主义；势力扩大，扩张主义 by entertainment 娱乐领域的美国帝国主义. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.metabolism
-> ##meta-,改变，-bol,扔，投，##词源同hyperbole,ballet,ballistic.即改变扔的方向，使发生变化，并用于生物学术语新陈代谢。比较anabolism.

Okay, now `主` everything I've said so far `谓` *has to do with* communication technologies, but transportation technologies 交通运输技术 were equally innovative (a.)革新的，创新的. In the first half of the 20th century, people mainly got around 四处走动；流传 by riding (v.) trains 乘火车. Starting in the 1930s, Europeans began to adopt (v.)收养；采取，采纳，接受 the automobile 汽车 more and more. By the end of the 20th century, entire 全部的，整个的 cities and suburbs 郊区 and rural areas 农村地区 were completely remade (v.) into the image of the car. What I mean is /roads were now the primary way to get anywhere you needed to go. 现在，公路是你到达任何地方的主要方式. With this kind of ease 容易；舒适，自在 of transportation, migration 迁移 *took place* more easily as well. +

[.my2]
20世纪上半叶，人们的出行主要依靠火车。从1930年代起，欧洲人开始越来越多地使用汽车。到20世纪末，整个城市、郊区和乡村地区都被彻底改造，以适应汽车的需求——我的意思是，道路成为通往任何目的地的首要途径。随着交通便利度的提升，人口迁移也变得更加频繁。

During this period, we also saw the rise of green parties 绿党 across Western and Central Europe /who made it their aim to challenge (v.) the effects of increasing consumerism (消费主义) 日益增长的消费主义的影响 and its corresponding 相应的，相关的 environmental degradation 环境恶化. And toward the end of the 20th century, they began to challenge (v.) globalization.

We've already talked _in this course_ about how the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 affected the environment, which is to say /it was nasty 恶劣的;令人不快的，令人厌恶的. In those days, unrestrained (a.)自然的；无限制的；放纵的 capitalism 不受约束的资本主义 *led to* the pollution of the air, the fouling  污染；污垢 of _the water supplies_ 水源污染, and the severe strain 严重压力 on the Earth's _natural resources_ 地球的自然资源. And that reality increased (v.) by a factor 系数;（增或减的）数量，倍数 of a metric buttload /in the age of globalization. +

[.my2]
在这门课程中，我们已经探讨过工业革命对环境造成的影响，也就是说，其后果是十分恶劣的。在那个时代，不受约束的资本主义导致了空气污染、水源污染, 以及对地球自然资源的严重消耗。而在全球化时代，这一状况更是加剧了，程度甚至达到了一个难以想象的程度。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.factor
(n.)
3.[ C] the amount /by which sth increases or decreases （增或减的）数量，倍数 +
•The real wage of the average worker has increased _by a factor of over ten_ in the last 70 years. 近70年来工人的实际工资, 平均增长超过了十倍。 +

4.[ C] a particular level on a scale of measurement 系数 +
•a suntan lotion with _a protection factor_ of 10. 防护系数为10的防晒油 +
•_The wind-chill factor_ will make it seem colder. 风寒系数大，会使人觉得比实际温度更冷一些。 +

====

By the 1970s, it became apparent 明显的 in Western and Eastern Europe /that `主` the globalizing effect 全球化效应 of commerce 商业 `谓` was *taking its toll* (（战争、灾难等造成的）毁坏；伤亡人数) 造成损害,产生不良影响 environmentally. For example, the Rhine River 莱茵河 was polluted and stank (v.)有臭味；有难闻的气味 worse than an elderly monkey's armpit (腋窝；<美，非正式>最差劲的地方，龌龊的地方) 老猴子的腋窝. Also, oil spills 石油泄漏 spoiled (v.) ecosystems 破坏生态系统 /and destroyed the natural beauty 自然风光 of Brittany 地名 in France, and on and on. And so /as a result, green parties arose (v.) /whose goal was *to get politicians 政治家，政客 elected* 让政治家当选 /who would *enact (v.) policy* to fix these problems. +

Now at first, green party candidates didn't gain (v.) much traction 吸引力；支持, but eventually they did. The first real success came from the German Green Party 德国绿党, who ran (v.) on a platform 纲领 of opposing (v.)反抗，阻碍 nuclear energy 反对核能 /and became especially prominent 突出的 after the Chernobyl disaster 切尔诺贝利灾难 in the Soviet Union, which deposited (v.)存放；储存；放置 untold 数不清的；未说过的；未透露的；无限的 amounts of radioactive (a.)放射性的，有辐射的 material 放射性物质 into the environment. By the end of the 20th century, every European state had its own version of a green party, and they are still rallying (v.)召集；集合 against 反对 globalization policies /that degrade (v.)降低，削弱（尤指质量） the environment 破坏环境的全球化政策. +

[.my2]
起初，绿党候选人并未获得太多支持，但最终他们还是取得了成功。第一个真正的突破来自德国绿党，该党以反对核能为竞选纲领，并在苏联切尔诺贝利灾难之后, 表现得尤为突出。那次灾难向环境中排放了大量放射性物质。到 20 世纪末，每个欧洲国家都有了自己的绿党组织，并且这些组织仍在反对那些破坏环境的全球化政策。

== 中文释义

好的，从20世纪的最后几十年开始，欧洲在经济和社会方面基本上实现了全球化，我觉得我们应该谈谈这是如何发生的, 以及这意味着什么。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

好的，全球化这个词描述的是: 世界在经济、政治和社会方面, 日益紧密的相互联系。如你所知，这种现象并不是在这一时期才开始的。就欧洲历史而言，自本课程所讲内容开始，**随着第一次帝国主义浪潮，"全球化"的某种形式就已经在发生了。**但在20世纪和21世纪，全球化变得更加广泛，而且这一过程发生的速度比以往任何时候都要快。这有三个原因。 +

第一个原因是"跨国公司"的大量涌现。根据定义，**跨国公司是一种在一个国家注册成立，但在其他国家生产和销售商品的实体。**这些公司的架构如下：公司在本国雇佣知识型员工，在其他国家生产商品，然后在全球市场上销售这些商品。雀巢公司（Nestlé）就是跨国公司的一个很好的例子。这家公司总部位于瑞士，在西非利用低薪劳动力（在某些情况下还存在童工和奴役劳动）采购和生产巧克力，然后在世界市场上销售这些美味的产品。 +

20世纪后期全球化迅速发展的第二个原因, 是"国际管理机构"的兴起。在这里，你可以想到欧盟（the European Union）或联合国（the United Nations）。**这些机构经常制定面向全球社会的政策，而不是制定只对单个国家有利的政策。**

20世纪全球化迅速发展的第三个原因, 是通信和交通技术的迅速崛起。基于此，我们接着看下一点。 +
新的通信和交通技术, 在时间和空间上成倍地增加了联系。例如，电话让身处远方的人们联系更加紧密。这种技术也让移民变得更容易被接受，因为那些搬走的人, 可以很方便地和家乡的家人保持联系。在20世纪30年代，收音机开始流行起来，到了20世纪50年代，电视出现了。电视尤其让娱乐变得更加大众化。在此之前，如果人们想看电影，他们得去电影院，而且一般来说，因为看电影很贵，这是一种精英活动。然而，随着20世纪50年代和60年代电视成本的降低，越来越多的普通人可以在家里观看电视节目。 +

但这和全球化有什么关系呢？嗯，特别是在一开始，很多节目内容来自美国，我一会儿会更多地谈到这一点。然后在20世纪90年代后期, 和21世纪初，互联网的兴起, 以前所未有的方式将世界连接起来。人们可以通过那些被称为计算机的新奇设备, 登录万维网，整个世界对他们来说都触手可及。这意味着来自世界各地的思想, 都可以影响人们。随着像亚马逊（Amazon.com）这样的在线零售商的兴起，商业活动也迅速增加。 +

就像我在几乎每个视频里说的那样，这一切听起来真的很棒，对吧？但人们对这些新的通信技术, 也存在一些反对意见。在欧洲，主要的不满之一是, 他们的很多娱乐内容是从美国进口的。在20世纪30年代，主要是通过美国电影的出口来实现这一点，然后随着20世纪50年代和60年代, 越来越多的家庭拥有电视，这种情况通过电视节目得以延续。美国媒体制作商以比他们自己制作节目成本低得多的价格, 将节目卖给欧洲的广播公司。这似乎是件好事 —— 毕竟，人们真的很喜欢这些节目 —— 但问题是什么呢？**问题是"娱乐并非是中立的"。每一部电影或电视节目, 都是根据某种文化所秉持的"价值观"来制作的(犹如中共在tiktok上推广中共意识形态)，所以当欧洲人大量接受美国娱乐节目的同时，他们也在吸收美国的价值观，而在某些方面，这些价值观与他们自己的价值观是相矛盾的。**所以，对新技术的热情和对这种美国娱乐帝国主义的批评之间的矛盾日益加剧。 +

好的，到目前为止我所说的一切, 都与通信技术有关，但"交通技术"同样具有创新性。在20世纪上半叶，人们主要通过乘坐火车出行。从20世纪30年代开始，欧洲人越来越多地使用汽车。到20世纪末，整个城市、郊区和农村地区, 都完全按照汽车时代的形象进行了改造。我的意思是，道路成了人们前往任何地方的主要出行方式。随着交通的便利，移民也变得更加容易。 +

在这一时期，我们还看到**西欧和中欧各地出现了绿党（green parties），他们的目标是挑战日益增长的"消费主义", 及其带来的环境恶化的影响**。在20世纪末，他们开始挑战全球化。在本课程中我们已经谈到"工业革命"对环境的影响，可以说情况很糟糕。在那个时代，*不受约束的资本主义, 导致了空气污染、水源污染，以及对地球自然资源的严重压力。在全球化时代，这种现实情况变得更加严重。* +

**到20世纪70年代，在东欧和西欧，"商业全球化"对环境造成的影响已经十分明显。**例如，莱茵河（the Rhine River）被污染了，而且臭气熏天。此外，石油泄漏破坏了生态系统，摧毁了法国布列塔尼（Brittany）的自然美景，诸如此类的情况还有很多。因此，绿党应运而生，他们的目标, 是让那些"会制定政策来解决这些问题"的政治家当选。 +

起初，绿党候选人并没有获得太多支持，但最终他们取得了一些成果。第一个真正的成功来自德国绿党（the German Green Party），他们以反对"核能"为竞选纲领，并且在苏联切尔诺贝利（Chernobyl）灾难后变得尤为突出，那场灾难将大量放射性物质释放到了环境中。*到20世纪末，每个欧洲国家都有了自己的绿党，而且他们仍在反对那些破坏环境的全球化政策。* +

Okay, starting in the last decades of the 20th century, Europe essentially became globalized in its economy and society, and I reckon we ought to talk about how that happened and what that means. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

Okay, now globalization is a word that describes the increasing economic, political, and social interconnectedness of the world. And as you know, this phenomenon didn't begin during this period. In terms of European history, some iteration of globalization had been occurring since the beginning of this course with the first wave of imperialism. But in the 20th and 21st centuries, globalization became more widespread, and the process by which it occurred was happening at a much greater speed than it ever had before. And there are three reasons for this.

First was the proliferation of multinational corporations. Now by definition, a multinational corporation is an entity which is incorporated in one country but manufactures and sells goods in other countries. And the architecture of these corporations is as follows: the corporations employ knowledge workers in their own countries, manufacture goods for sale in other countries, and then sell those goods on a global market. A good example of a multinational corporation is Nestlé. This company is headquartered in Switzerland, purchases and manufactures their chocolate with low-wage work in West Africa -- and in some cases child and enslaved labor -- and sells their glorious treats on the world market.

Now the second reason globalization occurred so rapidly in the late 20th century was the rise of international governing bodies. Here you can think about the European Union or the United Nations. These bodies often enact policies that are made for a global community over policies that would benefit a single state. And the third reason globalization occurred so rapidly in the 20th century was the rapid rise of communication and transportation technologies. And for that, let's move on to the next point.

So new communication and transportation technologies multiplied connections across time and space. For example, the telephone increasingly connected people in distant locations. This kind of technology also made migration and immigration more palatable, since those who moved away could easily stay in contact with their families back home. And during the 1930s, the radio rose to prominence, and during the 1950s, the television. And the television especially democratized entertainment. Prior to this, if people wanted to see moving pictures, they went to the theater, and in general because it was expensive, this was an elite activity. However, with the decreasing cost of the television throughout the 50s and 60s, more and more the average people could watch television programming in their homes.

But what does that have to do with globalization? Well, especially in the beginning, much of the programming came from the United States, and I'll talk more about that in a moment. Then in the late 90s and early 2000s, the rise of the internet connected the world in a way that had never been seen before. People could log on to the World Wide Web through those newfangled devices called computers, and the entire world was open to them. This meant that ideas from all over the world could influence people. And with the rise of online retailers like Amazon.com, commerce increased rapidly as well.

Now as I say in about every video, that all sounds really great, right? But there were some objections to these new communication technologies. And in Europe, one of the main gripes was that much of their entertainment was being imported from the United States. This was done in the 1930s mainly through the export of American movies, and then as the television was adopted in more and more homes through the 50s and the 60s, this was done through television programs. American media producers sold their shows to European broadcasters for a fraction of what it would cost them to produce the programs on their own. This seemed like a good thing -- like after all, people really liked these shows -- so what's the problem? The problem is that entertainment is not neutral. Every movie or television show is written according to the values that culture holds, and so as Europeans were digesting American entertainment by the metric buttload, they were also metabolizing American values that in some cases were contradictory to their own. So this tension grew between enthusiasm for new technology and criticism against this kind of American imperialism by entertainment.

Okay, now everything I've said so far has to do with communication technologies, but transportation technologies were equally innovative. In the first half of the 20th century, people mainly got around by riding trains. Starting in the 1930s, Europeans began to adopt the automobile more and more. By the end of the 20th century, entire cities and suburbs and rural areas were completely remade into the image of the car. What I mean is roads were now the primary way to get anywhere you needed to go. With this kind of ease of transportation, migration took place more easily as well.

During this period, we also saw the rise of green parties across Western and Central Europe who made it their aim to challenge the effects of increasing consumerism and its corresponding environmental degradation. And toward the end of the 20th century, they began to challenge globalization. We've already talked in this course about how the Industrial Revolution affected the environment, which is to say it was nasty. In those days, unrestrained capitalism led to the pollution of the air, the fouling of the water supplies, and the severe strain on the Earth's natural resources. And that reality increased by a factor of a metric buttload in the age of globalization.

By the 1970s, it became apparent in Western and Eastern Europe that the globalizing effect of commerce was taking its toll environmentally. For example, the Rhine River was polluted and stank worse than an elderly monkey's armpit. Also, oil spills spoiled ecosystems and destroyed the natural beauty of Brittany in France, and on and on. And so as a result, green parties arose whose goal was to get politicians elected who would enact policy to fix these problems.

Now at first, green party candidates didn't gain much traction, but eventually they did. The first real success came from the German Green Party, who ran on a platform of opposing nuclear energy and became especially prominent after the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union, which deposited untold amounts of radioactive material into the environment. By the end of the 20th century, every European state had its own version of a green party, and they are still rallying against globalization policies that degrade the environment.
