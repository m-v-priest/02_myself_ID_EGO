Okay, starting in the last decades of the 20th century, Europe essentially became globalized 全球化的 in its economy and society, and I reckon 认为 we ought to talk about how that happened and what that means. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Okay, now globalization 全球化 is a word that describes the increasing economic, political, and social interconnectedness 相互关联；相互依存 of the world. And as you know, this phenomenon 现象 didn't begin during this period. In terms of European history, some iteration 迭代；版本 of globalization had been occurring since the beginning of this course with the first wave of imperialism 帝国主义. But in the 20th and 21st centuries, globalization became more widespread, and the process by which it occurred was happening at a much greater speed than it ever had before. And there are three reasons for this. +

First was the proliferation 激增；扩散 of multinational corporations 跨国公司. Now by definition, a multinational corporation is an entity 实体 which is incorporated 注册成立 in one country but manufactures and sells goods in other countries. And the architecture 架构 of these corporations is as follows: the corporations employ knowledge workers 知识工作者 in their own countries, manufacture goods for sale in other countries, and then sell those goods on a global market 全球市场. A good example of a multinational corporation is Nestlé. This company is headquartered 总部设在 in Switzerland, purchases and manufactures their chocolate with low-wage work in West Africa -- and in some cases child and enslaved labor 童工和奴役劳动 -- and sells their glorious treats on the world market. +

Now the second reason globalization occurred so rapidly in the late 20th century was the rise of international governing bodies 国际管理机构. Here you can think about the European Union or the United Nations. These bodies often enact 制定；颁布 policies that are made for a global community over policies that would benefit a single state. And the third reason globalization occurred so rapidly in the 20th century was the rapid rise of communication and transportation technologies 通信和运输技术. And for that, let's move on to the next point. +

So new communication and transportation technologies multiplied connections across time and space. For example, the telephone increasingly connected people in distant locations. This kind of technology also made migration and immigration more palatable 可接受的, since those who moved away could easily stay in contact with their families back home. And during the 1930s, the radio rose to prominence 变得突出, and during the 1950s, the television. And the television especially democratized 使大众化；使普及 entertainment 娱乐. Prior to this, if people wanted to see moving pictures, they went to the theater, and in general because it was expensive, this was an elite activity 精英活动. However, with the decreasing cost of the television throughout the 50s and 60s, more and more the average people could watch television programming 电视节目 in their homes. +

But what does that have to do with globalization? Well, especially in the beginning, much of the programming came from the United States, and I'll talk more about that in a moment. Then in the late 90s and early 2000s, the rise of the internet connected the world in a way that had never been seen before. People could log on to 登录 the World Wide Web 万维网 through those newfangled 新奇的 devices called computers, and the entire world was open to them. This meant that ideas from all over the world could influence people. And with the rise of online retailers 在线零售商 like Amazon.com, commerce 商业 increased rapidly as well. +

Now as I say in about every video, that all sounds really great, right? But there were some objections 反对意见 to these new communication technologies. And in Europe, one of the main gripes 抱怨 was that much of their entertainment was being imported from the United States. This was done in the 1930s mainly through the export of American movies, and then as the television was adopted in more and more homes through the 50s and the 60s, this was done through television programs. American media producers sold their shows to European broadcasters 广播公司 for a fraction of what it would cost them to produce the programs on their own. This seemed like a good thing -- like after all, people really liked these shows -- so what's the problem? The problem is that entertainment is not neutral 中立的. Every movie or television show is written according to the values that culture holds, and so as Europeans were digesting 吸收 American entertainment by the metric buttload, they were also metabolizing 吸收；接受 American values that in some cases were contradictory to 与……矛盾 their own. So this tension 紧张关系 grew between enthusiasm 热情 for new technology and criticism 批评 against this kind of American imperialism by entertainment 娱乐领域的美国帝国主义. +

Okay, now everything I've said so far has to do with communication technologies, but transportation technologies were equally innovative 创新的. In the first half of the 20th century, people mainly got around by riding trains. Starting in the 1930s, Europeans began to adopt the automobile 汽车 more and more. By the end of the 20th century, entire cities and suburbs 郊区 and rural areas 农村地区 were completely remade into the image of the car. What I mean is roads were now the primary way to get anywhere you needed to go. With this kind of ease of transportation, migration 迁移 took place more easily as well. +

During this period, we also saw the rise of green parties 绿党 across Western and Central Europe who made it their aim to challenge the effects of increasing consumerism 消费主义 and its corresponding environmental degradation 环境恶化. And toward the end of the 20th century, they began to challenge globalization. We've already talked in this course about how the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 affected the environment, which is to say it was nasty 恶劣的. In those days, unrestrained capitalism 不受约束的资本主义 led to the pollution of the air, the fouling of the water supplies 水源污染, and the severe strain 严重压力 on the Earth's natural resources 地球自然资源. And that reality increased by a factor of a metric buttload in the age of globalization. +

By the 1970s, it became apparent 明显的 in Western and Eastern Europe that the globalizing effect of commerce 商业 was taking its toll 造成损害 environmentally. For example, the Rhine River 莱茵河 was polluted and stank worse than an elderly monkey's armpit. Also, oil spills 石油泄漏 spoiled ecosystems 破坏生态系统 and destroyed the natural beauty of Brittany in France, and on and on. And so as a result, green parties arose whose goal was to get politicians elected who would enact policy to fix these problems. +

Now at first, green party candidates didn't gain much traction 吸引力；支持, but eventually they did. The first real success came from the German Green Party 德国绿党, who ran on a platform 纲领 of opposing nuclear energy 反对核能 and became especially prominent 突出的 after the Chernobyl disaster 切尔诺贝利灾难 in the Soviet Union, which deposited untold amounts of radioactive material 放射性物质 into the environment. By the end of the 20th century, every European state had its own version of a green party, and they are still rallying against 反对 globalization policies that degrade the environment 破坏环境的全球化政策. +

== 中文释义

好的，从20世纪的最后几十年开始，欧洲在经济和社会方面基本上实现了全球化，我觉得我们应该谈谈这是如何发生的, 以及这意味着什么。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

好的，全球化这个词描述的是: 世界在经济、政治和社会方面, 日益紧密的相互联系。如你所知，这种现象并不是在这一时期才开始的。就欧洲历史而言，自本课程所讲内容开始，**随着第一次帝国主义浪潮，"全球化"的某种形式就已经在发生了。**但在20世纪和21世纪，全球化变得更加广泛，而且这一过程发生的速度比以往任何时候都要快。这有三个原因。 +

第一个原因是"跨国公司"的大量涌现。根据定义，**跨国公司是一种在一个国家注册成立，但在其他国家生产和销售商品的实体。**这些公司的架构如下：公司在本国雇佣知识型员工，在其他国家生产商品，然后在全球市场上销售这些商品。雀巢公司（Nestlé）就是跨国公司的一个很好的例子。这家公司总部位于瑞士，在西非利用低薪劳动力（在某些情况下还存在童工和奴役劳动）采购和生产巧克力，然后在世界市场上销售这些美味的产品。 +

20世纪后期全球化迅速发展的第二个原因, 是"国际管理机构"的兴起。在这里，你可以想到欧盟（the European Union）或联合国（the United Nations）。**这些机构经常制定面向全球社会的政策，而不是制定只对单个国家有利的政策。**

20世纪全球化迅速发展的第三个原因, 是通信和交通技术的迅速崛起。基于此，我们接着看下一点。 +
新的通信和交通技术, 在时间和空间上成倍地增加了联系。例如，电话让身处远方的人们联系更加紧密。这种技术也让移民变得更容易被接受，因为那些搬走的人, 可以很方便地和家乡的家人保持联系。在20世纪30年代，收音机开始流行起来，到了20世纪50年代，电视出现了。电视尤其让娱乐变得更加大众化。在此之前，如果人们想看电影，他们得去电影院，而且一般来说，因为看电影很贵，这是一种精英活动。然而，随着20世纪50年代和60年代电视成本的降低，越来越多的普通人可以在家里观看电视节目。 +

但这和全球化有什么关系呢？嗯，特别是在一开始，很多节目内容来自美国，我一会儿会更多地谈到这一点。然后在20世纪90年代后期, 和21世纪初，互联网的兴起, 以前所未有的方式将世界连接起来。人们可以通过那些被称为计算机的新奇设备, 登录万维网，整个世界对他们来说都触手可及。这意味着来自世界各地的思想, 都可以影响人们。随着像亚马逊（Amazon.com）这样的在线零售商的兴起，商业活动也迅速增加。 +

就像我在几乎每个视频里说的那样，这一切听起来真的很棒，对吧？但人们对这些新的通信技术, 也存在一些反对意见。在欧洲，主要的不满之一是, 他们的很多娱乐内容是从美国进口的。在20世纪30年代，主要是通过美国电影的出口来实现这一点，然后随着20世纪50年代和60年代, 越来越多的家庭拥有电视，这种情况通过电视节目得以延续。美国媒体制作商以比他们自己制作节目成本低得多的价格, 将节目卖给欧洲的广播公司。这似乎是件好事 —— 毕竟，人们真的很喜欢这些节目 —— 但问题是什么呢？**问题是"娱乐并非是中立的"。每一部电影或电视节目, 都是根据某种文化所秉持的"价值观"来制作的(犹如中共在tiktok上推广中共意识形态)，所以当欧洲人大量接受美国娱乐节目的同时，他们也在吸收美国的价值观，而在某些方面，这些价值观与他们自己的价值观是相矛盾的。**所以，对新技术的热情和对这种美国娱乐帝国主义的批评之间的矛盾日益加剧。 +

好的，到目前为止我所说的一切, 都与通信技术有关，但"交通技术"同样具有创新性。在20世纪上半叶，人们主要通过乘坐火车出行。从20世纪30年代开始，欧洲人越来越多地使用汽车。到20世纪末，整个城市、郊区和农村地区, 都完全按照汽车时代的形象进行了改造。我的意思是，道路成了人们前往任何地方的主要出行方式。随着交通的便利，移民也变得更加容易。 +

在这一时期，我们还看到**西欧和中欧各地出现了绿党（green parties），他们的目标是挑战日益增长的"消费主义", 及其带来的环境恶化的影响**。在20世纪末，他们开始挑战全球化。在本课程中我们已经谈到"工业革命"对环境的影响，可以说情况很糟糕。在那个时代，*不受约束的资本主义, 导致了空气污染、水源污染，以及对地球自然资源的严重压力。在全球化时代，这种现实情况变得更加严重。* +

**到20世纪70年代，在东欧和西欧，"商业全球化"对环境造成的影响已经十分明显。**例如，莱茵河（the Rhine River）被污染了，而且臭气熏天。此外，石油泄漏破坏了生态系统，摧毁了法国布列塔尼（Brittany）的自然美景，诸如此类的情况还有很多。因此，绿党应运而生，他们的目标, 是让那些"会制定政策来解决这些问题"的政治家当选。 +

起初，绿党候选人并没有获得太多支持，但最终他们取得了一些成果。第一个真正的成功来自德国绿党（the German Green Party），他们以反对"核能"为竞选纲领，并且在苏联切尔诺贝利（Chernobyl）灾难后变得尤为突出，那场灾难将大量放射性物质释放到了环境中。*到20世纪末，每个欧洲国家都有了自己的绿党，而且他们仍在反对那些破坏环境的全球化政策。* +
