== 释义

So World War One was not _the war to end (v.) all wars_ like everyone wanted it to be. There was in fact a World War II, and in this video /we're going to look at it _straight in the face_ 直面. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now in the last video, I mentioned _all the precipitating (a.)使…突然降临；加速（坏事的发生）;促成的；引发的 factors_ 后定说明 that led to the war, so here /let's just *jump straight into* the fight. There were essentially two theaters 战场；战区 of the war: there was the European theater 战场；战区 and the Pacific theater. When I say _theater of war_ -- maybe you don't know that terminology 术语；专业用语 -- but it's not that hard to understand 这并不难理解. Basically it means that /there were two stages /upon which the events of World War II unfolded: one stage here /and one stage here. +

So the war essentially began in the Pacific theater first, and *for* that /we have Japan *to thank*.  +
Since the last part of the 19th century, continued into the early decades of the 20th century 从19世纪后半叶开始，一直持续到20世纪初, Japan had risen to dominance (n.)优势，支配地位 in the Eastern world 日本已崛起为东方世界的主宰. Driven by _policies of aggressive (a.) expansionism_ (扩张主义) 侵略性扩张主义的政策, Japan had won (v.) victories against China and then against Russia, and then *gobbled 狼吞虎咽地吃 up* 吞并；吞噬 many territories in Southeast Asia. Because Japan was also gripped 紧握；紧抓 by fascist leadership, there was a natural affinity (n.)喜好，喜爱；类同，密切关系；吸引力 between them and Germany and Italy.  +
But anyway, the war on the Pacific essentially began in 1937 /when the Chinese and Japanese forces (n.) clashed (v.)冲突；交战 over the Japanese seizure (n.)占领；夺取 of Manchuria 满洲. +

Anyway, over in the European theater of World War II 在二战的欧洲战场上, the war was triggered 引发；触发 by Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Now you might recall 回想起 from the last video that /Britain and France had been abiding by 遵守；信守 the policy of appeasement 绥靖政策 with regards to 关于；至于 Hitler's expansionism across Europe. But the invasion of Poland was the last straw 最后一根稻草；忍无可忍的事, and with that, Britain and France *declared war* on Germany. And baby, you got another world war /on your hands. +

.you got another world war /on your hands.
字面意思是 ​​“你手上又多了一场世界大战”​​， +
实际含义是：​​“这下可好，又一场世界大战爆发了！”​

Now once the war started, there were two opposing sides. _The Allied Powers_ 同盟国 included Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and then later the United States would join (v.) as well. _The Axis powers_ 轴心国 essentially included Germany, Italy, and Japan.

And the truth is, early in the war, the Axis powers seemed to *be dunking （吃前将食物放入液体中）浸一浸，泡一泡 on* 打败；击败(在篮球比赛中扣篮得分, 并且将球砸在对手头上以示嘲讽或挑衅) the Allied powers profoundly 极大地，深刻地；严重地，完全地. And `主` _no small 不小的 part_ of _said (a.)前述的、上述的 dunking_ (扣篮) 上述的碾压态势 `系` was #due# (a.)由于；因为;应支付；应给予；应归于 -- in the European theater -- #to# Hitler's method of attack /known as blitzkrieg 闪电战；突然袭击. It literally means (v.) lightning war /because when the Germans *showed up* 露面,突然出现,从天而降, it was like, "And we're dead 我们完了." It was called this /because it was a tactic 战术；策略 /designed to crush (v.) an enemy at an incredible speed /using a combination 结合，联合 of air power, tanks, and ground troops.

German forces *plowed (v.)犁（田）；耕（地）；翻（土） through* (突破；冲破)（像犁地一样）强力冲破、碾压式推进 the enemy lines /and then went on /to terrorize (v.) 恐吓；使恐惧 the civilian populations of these countries. +

[.my2]
而事实是，战争初期，轴心国似乎对盟军形成了全面碾压。这种碾压态势的形成——在欧洲战场上——很大程度上要归功于希特勒的"闪电战"攻击方式。其字面意思是"闪电战争"，因为当德军来袭时，对方的反应基本是："我们完了"。这种战术得名于其结合空中力量、坦克和地面部队，以惊人速度击溃敌人的特点。德军会撕裂敌方防线，继而对这些国家的平民百姓实施恐怖统治。

*Not only* did this work /in Eastern European countries like Poland, Yugoslavia, and Greece, *but* it *also* worked in the West too. In 1941, Hitler invaded (v.) France with these same tactics, and they were positively 明确地；明白无误地 dazed (v.)使眩晕；使惶惑;目瞪口呆的；眩晕的 by the Nazi attack.  +
It wasn't long /before France fell to Germany, and `主` Mussolini over in Italy  `谓` *rushed to France* as well /to grab (v.) _a piece of_ that sweet French pie. 意大利的墨索里尼也冲到法国去抢一块法国馅饼。  Now the northern part of France was under _direct occupation_ 占领 by Germany, while `主` a Nazi puppet (n.)木偶；傀儡 government 傀儡政府 known as Vichy France 维希法国 `谓` was established in the south. +

Then in June 六月 of 1941, Hitler turned his sights on 把目光转向 the Soviet Union. You may remember _in the last video_ I talked about the non-aggression pact 互不侵犯条约 /that Hitler signed  (v.) with Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union. It was an agreement /that they would not attack each other. But Hitler never really intended to honor (v.) this pact -- it was just an agreement /to buy him some time to conquer (v.) the rest of Europe /without interference (n.)干涉，干预 from those pesky (a.)讨厌的；麻烦的 Soviets.

But in 1941, Hitler launched (v.)  Operation Barbarossa 巴巴罗萨行动 /in which he sought to conquer the Soviet Union, which he needed  /for 为了,因为(表目的) all the natural resources 后定说明 bound up in that land. 他需要征服苏联,目的是为了​​获取那片土地上的所有自然资源。

Hitler won some early victories in this campaign, but ultimately the Soviets rallied (v.)召集；重整（军队）；使……恢复（或振作）;重整旗鼓；振作起来 and made any further gains very difficult 使(德国的)任何进一步的收获都变得非常困难. In fact, Hitler's troops got *so* bogged (v.)使……陷于泥淖 down 陷入泥沼,陷入困境 *that* they were stationed (v.)驻扎，部署 there through winter -- which, if Hitler had bothered to consult (v.)咨询，请教 Napoleon on, he would know /that was a bad idea. Anyway, Germans were able to hold some Soviet territory, but they were never able to fully conquer (v.) it. +

.Operation Barbarossa
巴巴罗萨行动（Operation Barbarossa）是第二次世界大战中, 纳粹德国于1941年6月22日对苏联发动的一次大规模军事入侵行动。这次行动是历史上规模最大的军事行动之一，也是纳粹德国在东线战场上的关键转折点。

行动目的与背景 +
巴巴罗萨行动的代号, 源自神圣罗马帝国皇帝腓特烈一世（Friedrich Barbarossa），他因其红胡子而得名，象征着德意志民族的扩张精神。希特勒对苏联的入侵主要基于以下几个目的：

- *生存空间（Lebensraum）：希特勒认为德国需要向东扩张, 以获取更多的土地和资源，供“雅利安”民族生存与繁衍。苏联广袤的土地和资源是其主要目标。*

- 意识形态对抗：纳粹主义和共产主义, 是两种根本对立的意识形态。希特勒将苏联视为犹太布尔什维克主义的中心，坚信必须彻底摧毁它。

- 资源掠夺：纳粹德国需要苏联的石油、谷物和矿产资源, 来维持其战争机器的运转。

尽管德国和苏联在1939年签署了《苏德互不侵犯条约》，但希特勒从未放弃入侵苏联的计划。他相信，一旦苏联被击败，英国将被迫求和，从而为他建立一个横跨欧洲的帝国铺平道路。

行动经过: +
德军集结了约380万兵力，分为三个主要集团军群： +
北方集团军群：目标是攻占列宁格勒（今圣彼得堡）。 +
中央集团军群：目标是攻占苏联首都莫斯科。 +
南方集团军群：目标是攻占乌克兰的谷物产区, 和高加索的油田。 +

- 莫斯科（Moscow）: +
莫斯科是苏联的首都. 也是苏联最大的铁路和公路网络中心，四通八达，连接着苏联的各个地区。

- 列宁格勒（Leningrad） +
*海军基地：是苏联"波罗的海舰队"的主要基地，也是波罗的海沿岸最大的港口。攻占它将使德国海军完全控制波罗的海，并消除苏联海军对德国航运的威胁。* +
工业中心：列宁格勒**是苏联重要的工业和军事生产中心，特别是重工业和军火工业。占领它将严重削弱苏联的战争生产能力。**

**#德军必须同时对苏联的政治、军事和经济命脉, 进行全面打击。旨在在一场“闪电战”中瘫痪苏联的所有关键功能，#**使其在冬季来临前就彻底崩溃。

image:/img/Operation Barbarossa.webp[,100%]


行动初期，德军取得了惊人的进展。他们利用闪电战（Blitzkrieg）战术，迅速突破苏军防线，包围了数百万苏军，并在几个月内深入苏联腹地数百公里。苏军在行动初期遭受了巨大的损失，伤亡惨重。

然而，德军的攻势在进入秋冬季节后逐渐放缓。以下几个因素最终导致了行动的失败：

- 严寒的冬季：1941年末，苏联遭遇了极度严酷的寒冬。德军缺乏御寒装备，许多士兵被冻伤，车辆和武器也因低温而无法正常运行。
- 苏军的顽强抵抗：尽管损失惨重，但苏军在斯大林的指挥下进行了顽强抵抗，尤其是在莫斯科战役中，苏军的反攻迫使德军停止了前进。
- *战线过长：德军的补给线被拉得过长，后勤保障变得异常困难，无法有效支持前线部队。*

历史影响: +
*#巴巴罗萨行动的失败，标志着纳粹德国在东线战场上的攻势由盛转衰，是第二次世界大战的关键转折点之一。#*

- 双线作战：**行动的失败, 迫使德国陷入了长期而消耗巨大的双线作战，**这正是希特勒试图避免的局面。
- 苏联的复兴：尽管初期遭受重创，但苏联在战争中逐渐恢复元气，最终在盟军的配合下，成为击败纳粹德国的主力之一。
- 纳粹暴行：在入侵苏联的过程中，德军在占领区实施了残酷的种族清洗政策，对苏联平民和战俘进行了大规模屠杀，这也是大屠杀的重要组成部分。

Now by 1940, `主` _the only real threat_ to Hitler /that was left (v.) on the continent /`系` was Britain 欧洲大陆上对希特勒唯一的真正威胁就是英国了. Like, no other Western state was opposing (v.)反抗，阻碍;与……竞争 him. And under the leadership of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the British people *rallied 召集；重整（军队）；使……恢复（或振作） to the cause* (原因；事业；理由) 团结一致, 团结起来为之奋斗.


Hitler assumed 假定，假设，认为 that /`主` bombing campaigns 轰炸行动 aimed at British civilian populations `谓` would *so* demoralize (v.)使士气低落；使丧失信心 the British *that* they would beg (v.)乞求，恳求 their government to surrender. But those bombing raids 空袭 had the opposite effect. Thanks to the bulldoggish (a.)像斗牛犬的，顽强的 tenacity (n.)顽强；坚韧，执着，坚持；黏性 of Churchill, he organized the resistance  反对，抵制 /and gave moving speeches 发表了感人的演讲 后定说明 that roused 激起；唤起 the British people to continue (v.) the resistance. +

Now I said that /Britain was standing alone, but that's not entirely accurate 并不完全准确. More accurately, Britain was the only Western country /that had officially declared war on Germany /that was continuing the resistance. But there was another Western country /who was undeclared (a.) in war /that was handily 便利地；轻易地;敏捷地；灵巧地 supporting the British cause, namely the United States.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.that *was handily supporting* the British cause
这里的 ​​"handily"​*它远远不止是“方便地”，而是蕴含着​​“轻松地”、“有效地”、“毫无困难地”、“游刃有余地”​​ 等多重含义，强调做某事时毫不费力且效率很高。*

​​"handily supporting"​​中，​​"handily"​​ 的核心意思是：
​​“以一种提供巨大且有效帮助的方式”​​ 或者 ​​“得力地”​​。

After World War One, Americans essentially turned into an isolationist 孤立主义的 nation /with regard to 关于，就……而言 European conflicts. They just needed a little me-time 私人专属时间 after the great European war. However, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt could see that /if Britain fell to the Germans, that would be a bad situation for the United States. So the U.S. had been supplying the British with weapons of war /through their _Cash and Carry program_ 现购自运计划,现金自运计划 and their _Destroyers 驱逐舰 for Bases programs_ 驱逐舰换基地计划, etc. So even though the United States wasn't officially a belligerent (n.a.)交战国；交战方; 敌对的，好战的；<正式> 参战的，交战的 in the war, it was clear to the whole world /where their sympathies 同情 led 通向；通往. +


[.my2]
我之前说英国在孤军奋战，但这种说法并不完全准确。更准确地说，英国是​​唯一一个​​对德国正式宣战并仍在坚持抵抗的西方国家。 +
但是，还有另一个未公开宣战的西方国家，正在​​不遗余力地​​支持英国的事业，那就是​​美国​​。第一次世界大战后，美国在对待欧洲冲突的问题上基本上变成了一个​​孤立主义​​国家。在经历了那场伟大的欧洲战争之后，他们只是需要一点 ​​“自己的时间”（me-time）​​ 来休整。 +
然而，美国总统富兰克林·D·罗斯福很清楚，如果英国被德国击败，那对美国来说将是一个​​非常糟糕的局面​​。因此，美国一直通过 ​​《现购自运》法案（Cash and Carry program）​​ 和 ​​《驱逐舰换基地》协议（Destroyers for Bases programs）​​ 等项目向英国供应战争武器。 +
所以，尽管美国还不是战争中的​​正式交战国（belligerent）​​，但全世界都清楚地知道他们的​​同情心（sympathies）​​ 偏向哪一边。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.belligerent
-> 词根 #bell, 好战#，同 Bellona, 司战女神。#ger, 含有，带来#，同ingest, 消化。



.Cash and Carry Program
现购自运政策

背景：在二战爆发前，美国通过了《中立法案》（Neutrality Acts），旨在避免美国卷入欧洲冲突。该法案禁止向交战国出售武器、弹药或提供贷款。

内容：随着德国入侵波兰，欧洲战火重燃，罗斯福总统意识到需要改变政策以帮助盟国。1939年，*美国国会通过了一项修正案，提出了“现购自运”政策。该政策允许美国公司向交战国出售武器和军事物资，但有两个严格的条件：*

*- 现购（Cash）：必须立即以现金支付，不能赊账或贷款。
- 自运（Carry）：购买国必须使用自己的船只来运输货物，美国船只被禁止进入战区。*

*目的与影响：这项政策表面上是中立的，对所有交战国开放。但实际上，它极大地偏向了英国和法国。因为只有它们拥有庞大的海军和足够的现金来满足这些条件。而德国及其盟友由于被英国皇家海军封锁，根本无法使用海运*。因此，“现购自运”政策有效地规避了《中立法案》，为英国提供了急需的军事物资，同时让美国避免了与德国海军的直接冲突，维持了“中立”的表象。

.Destroyers for Bases Agreement
“驱逐舰换基地”协议

背景：1940年法国战败后，英国独自面对德国的威胁。大西洋上，德国的潜艇（U-boats）对英国的商船队造成了毁灭性打击，英国急需更多的军舰来保护其海上生命线。英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔直接向罗斯福求助，希望获得美国驱逐舰的支援。

内容：1940年9月，罗斯福与丘吉尔达成了一项行政协议（Executive Agreement）。**根据协议，美国将向英国提供50艘老旧的一战时期驱逐舰。作为交换，英国将允许美国在其位于大西洋和加勒比海的八处领土上建立军事基地，并提供99年的租借权。**这些基地包括纽芬兰、百慕大、巴哈马、牙买加等地。

image:/img/Destroyers for Bases Agreement.jpg[,100%]



目的与影响：这项协议, 是美国从“中立”向“非交战盟友”转变的又一个重要标志。

对英国而言，这50艘驱逐舰虽然老旧，但为皇家海军提供了急需的护航力量，加强了其反潜能力，帮助抵御了德国的潜艇威胁。 +
*对美国而言，获得这些战略性军事基地极大地增强了美国在大西洋的防御能力，为保护西半球安全提供了前沿阵地。*

政治意义：**由于该协议是"行政协议", 而非"条约"，罗斯福绕过了国会中强大的孤立主义势力，得以迅速行动。**尽管该协议引发了争议，但它清晰地向全世界表明，美国正在积极地向英国提供援助，尽管其尚未正式参战。

这两项政策和协议，加上后来的《租借法案》（Lend-Lease Act），共同构成了二战初期美国支持盟国、逐步从"孤立主义"走向"参战"的关键步骤。

This loyalty  忠诚，忠贞；忠于……的强烈情感 was abundantly  丰富地；大量地 clear to Japan, who realized that /America's friendship with Britain would eventually bring the industrial giant 巨人,大国 into the war, and they wanted to prevent it. And so on December 7, 1941, Japanese planes bombed (v.) the U.S. _naval base_ at Pearl Harbor 珍珠港 in Hawaii. And with that kind of aggression, the United States declared war on Japan. Germany went ahead /and declared war on the United States, and now we're in. +

战争结束后，人们纷纷统计伤亡人数，这才发现在这场战争中丧生的人数, 比其他任何战争都要多——包括第一次世界大战也不例外。而这场战争中的大量伤亡人数, 正是由新出现且极具破坏性的战争技术所导致的，接下来我会向你们介绍其中的两种技术。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.a large part of that death toll `系` was the new and devastating war technology 后定 employed
这句的主干意思是"很大一部分的死伤是战争科技", 中文说不通, 英语原句里是不是缺少了类似"由什么造成"这类词? 中文应该是"很大一部分的死伤是战争科技造成的"才说得通.

其实, 这个句子在英文里是成立的. 在英语中，特别是口语或非正式的书面语中，这种**“名词-系动词-名词”的结构非常常见，用来表达因果关系或原因/结果**。它是一种简洁的表达方式，省略了像 "caused by"（由…造成）或 "result of"（…的结果）这样的词。

**#在这种语境下，was 扮演的角色更像是“...的原因是...”或“...是由...造成的”#**。

我们可以将原句理解为： +
"A large part of that death toll `谓` was caused by the new and devastating war technology employed."  +
（那部分死伤中的很大一部分, 是由被使用的新式毁灭性战争科技造成的。）
或者更简洁地理解为：那部分死伤的很大一部分, 就是这些新科技造成的。

这种用法在英语中很普遍，例如：

- "The reason for his success was hard work." （他成功的原因是努力工作。）
- "My biggest fear is public speaking." （我最大的恐惧是公众演讲。）

在这两个例子中，“成功”和“恐惧”本身并不是“努力工作”和“演讲”，但它们之间存在因果或等同关系。

- A large part of the death toll ​​was​​ the new technology.
很大一部分死亡人数​​就是​​新技术【本身】. 它隐含的意思是：“新技术​​的运用​​”或“新技术​​所导致的后果​​”是造成巨大伤亡的主要原因。读者会自动在脑中补全这层因果关系。

结论：​​ 原句​​语法上完全不缺成分​​，它是一个地道的、符合英语表达习惯的​​主系表结构​​。您觉得它“缺词”，是因为敏锐地察觉到了​​英汉两种语言在表达逻辑关系时的巨大差异​​。在翻译时，必须按照中文习惯，将英文中隐含的“造成”、“导致”这层意思明确地翻译出来。

根据历史记录，二战中使用的主要燃烧弹（incendiary bombs）的外壳材料通常不是木头，而是能够自身燃烧的金属，特别是镁合金或铝合金。 +
填充物：通常是 铝热剂（thermite） 或 凝固汽油（napalm）。铝热剂是一种混合物，燃烧温度可达数千摄氏度，能够熔化钢铁。凝固汽油则是一种胶状燃油，能附着在物体表面长时间燃烧。

你提到的原文 "These were bombs that were casing wood housing" 中的 "wood housing" 很可能是作者的口误或不准确的描述。最有可能的真实情况是，这些燃烧弹的设计就是为了烧毁目标城市的木结构房屋，而不是它们本身由木头制成。

所以第一次世界大战并非如人们所期望的那样，是一场终结所有战争的战争。事实上，后来还有第二次世界大战，在这个视频中，我们将直面这场战争。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

在上一个视频中，我提到了导致这场战争的所有促成因素，所以在这里，我们直接进入战斗环节。**这场战争本质上有两个战区：欧洲战区和太平洋战区。**当我说“战区”时 —— 也许你不了解这个术语 —— 但这并不难理解。基本上，这意味着第二次世界大战的事件在两个“舞台”上展开：一个在这儿，一个在那儿。 +

所以**这场战争本质上首先在太平洋战区爆发，这得“归功于”日本。**从19世纪后期到20世纪的头几十年，日本在东方世界崛起并占据主导地位。在侵略扩张主义政策的驱动下，日本先是战胜了中国，然后又战胜了俄罗斯，接着吞并了东南亚的许多领土。因为日本也由法西斯势力领导，所以它与德国和意大利有着天然的“亲近感”。不管怎样，太平洋战争实际上始于1937年，当时中日军队因日本对满洲（Manchuria）的占领而发生冲突。 +

不管怎样，在第二次世界大战的**欧洲战区，战争是由阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）1939年入侵波兰（Poland）引发的。**你可能还记得上一个视频中提到的，英国和法国对希特勒在欧洲的扩张主义一直奉行"绥靖政策"。但入侵波兰成了压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草，因此，英国和法国向德国宣战。这下，又一场世界大战爆发了。 +

战争一旦爆发，就有了两个对立的阵营。同盟国（Allied Powers）包括英国、法国和苏联，后来美国也加入了。轴心国（Axis powers）主要包括德国、意大利和日本。事实上，在战争初期，轴心国似乎狠狠地“教训”了同盟国。在欧洲战区，这种“教训”在很大程度上要归因于希特勒的攻击策略，也就是闪电战（blitzkrieg）。这个词字面意思是“闪电战”，因为当德国人出现时，就好像在说：“我们死定了。”之所以叫闪电战，是因为这是一种结合了空中力量、坦克和地面部队，以惊人的速度击溃敌人的战术。德国军队突破了敌人的防线，然后开始恐吓这些国家的平民百姓。 +

这种战术不仅在波兰、南斯拉夫（Yugoslavia）和希腊等东欧国家奏效，在西方也同样有效。1941年，希特勒用同样的战术入侵法国，纳粹的攻击让法国彻底懵了。没过多久，法国就向德国投降了，意大利的墨索里尼（Mussolini）也赶紧跑到法国，想分一杯羹。法国北部被德国直接占领，而在南部建立了一个名为维希法国（Vichy France）的纳粹傀儡政府。 +

**然后在1941年6月，希特勒把目光转向了苏联。**你可能还记得上一个视频中我提到的，**希特勒与苏联领导人约瑟夫·斯大林（Joseph Stalin）签署的互不侵犯条约。**这是一个双方互不攻击的协议。**但希特勒从来没打算遵守这个条约 —— 这只是一个为他争取时间，以便在不受讨厌的苏联干扰的情况下征服欧洲其他地区的协议。但在1941年，希特勒发动了“巴巴罗萨行动”（Operation Barbarossa），试图征服苏联，因为他需要苏联土地上的所有自然资源。**希特勒在这场战役初期取得了一些胜利，但最终苏联进行了反击，让德军很难再取得进一步的进展。事实上，希特勒的军队深陷其中，还在那儿度过了冬天 —— 如果希特勒事先咨询过拿破仑，他就会知道这是个糟糕的主意。不管怎样，德国人虽然占领了一些苏联领土，但始终未能完全征服苏联。 +

一个典型的例子就是这场战役中的"斯大林格勒（Stalingrad）保卫战"。苏联的平民和军队忍受着残酷的条件，但绝不投降，最终德军伤亡达75万人，却始终无法控制苏联的这个据点。所以这么说吧，轴心国 —— 尤其是德国 —— 在战争初期来势汹汹，但最终局势开始逆转。 +

到了1940年，欧洲大陆上对希特勒唯一真正的威胁是英国。其他西方国家都没有反抗他。在首相温斯顿·丘吉尔（Winston Churchill）的领导下，英国人民团结起来抵抗。希特勒认为，针对英国平民的轰炸行动, 会让英国人士气低落，从而乞求政府投降。但这些轰炸行动却适得其反。多亏了丘吉尔顽强的韧性，他组织了抵抗力量，并发表了激动人心的演讲，鼓舞英国人民继续抵抗。 +

我说英国是孤军奋战，但这并不完全准确。更准确地说，英国是唯一一个正式向德国宣战并持续抵抗的西方国家。但还有另一个未正式宣战的西方国家，大力支持英国，那就是美国。**第一次世界大战后，美国在欧洲冲突问题上, 基本上变成了一个孤立主义国家。**在那场伟大的欧洲战争之后，他们只是想给自己一些“独处”的时间。然而，美国总统富兰克林·D·罗斯福（Franklin D. Roosevelt）明白，如果英国向德国投降，对美国来说将是个糟糕的局面。所以美国通过“现购自运”计划（Cash and Carry program）和“以驱逐舰换基地”计划（Destroyers for Bases programs）等，向英国提供战争武器。所以，*尽管美国没有正式参战，但全世界都清楚他们支持哪一方。* +

日本也清楚美国对英国的这种忠诚，他们意识到美国与英国的友好关系, 最终会让这个工业巨头卷入战争，他们想阻止这种情况发生。于是在1941年12月7日，日本飞机轰炸了美国在夏威夷（Hawaii）的海军基地珍珠港（Pearl Harbor）。面对这种侵略行为，*美国向日本宣战。德国也紧接着向美国宣战，这下大家都参战了。* +

多亏了美国强大的工业能力，各种各样的工厂几乎在一夜之间, 就转型为生产战争武器的工厂。美国在短时间内调集的飞机、枪支、坦克以及其他各种武器，对战争产生了重大影响。此外，**英美在诺曼底登陆日（D-Day）对法国的联合入侵，成为了西线战争的转折点。**他们成功地让德国人误以为入侵会从另一个地方发起，然后在1944年6月6日，英美在诺曼底（Normandy）海滩上发动了世界历史上规模最大的两栖登陆行动。尽管他们为此付出了惨重的伤亡代价，但**最终成功地把法国从纳粹占领下解放了出来。** +

**由于苏联的全力以赴，东欧的局势开始扭转。**就像我之前提到的斯大林格勒保卫战一样，**##太平洋战区的战争局势在"中途岛海战"（Battle of Midway）中发生了改变，美国##军队**在这场海战中击败了日本海军，**##然后展开了跳岛作战，##切断了日本的补给线。**最终，盟军不断逼近柏林，希特勒带着他的反犹思想躲进了地堡，还在把德国遭受的所有不幸都归咎于犹太人。他没有承认失败，而是选择了自杀。*1945年5月7日，德国政府投降。这一天在欧洲战区被称为"欧洲胜利日"*（VE Day，Victory in Europe Day）。战争接近尾声。 +

但为了说明太平洋战区是如何结束的，我们需要谈谈这场战争中使用的一些新技术。战争结束后，人们统计了死亡人数，意识到这场战争的死亡人数比其他任何一场战争都多 —— 第一次世界大战也不例外。而死亡人数如此之多，很大程度上是因为使用了新的、具有毁灭性的战争技术，我来给你们介绍其中的两种。 +

第一种是"燃烧弹"的使用。这些炸弹被用来攻击木质房屋，不仅会爆炸，还会引发火灾。美国空军对东京进行的燃烧弹轰炸中，东京16平方英里的区域被大火烧毁，造成10万人死亡。然后英美飞机对德国的德累斯顿（Dresden）也做了同样的事，虽然那里的死亡人数只有东京的四分之一左右，但仍然具有极大的破坏力。 +

但也许第二次世界大战中引入的最具毁灭性的技术, 是原子弹。这是美国人制造的一种炸弹，它能够破坏原子的稳定性，并释放由此产生的破坏性能量。一枚核弹的爆炸力相当于约20000吨炸药。所以，为了结束太平洋战区的战争，美国向日本投下了两颗原子弹：一颗投在了广岛（Hiroshima），另一颗投在了长崎（Nagasaki）。两颗原子弹让这两座城市都被摧毁，造成了10万到20万人死亡。在第二颗原子弹投下几天后，日本投降，这一天被称为"日本胜利日"（VJ Day，Victory in Japan Day）。 +

别误会，战争结束是件好事。但事实上，核武器的出现将在未来引发很多麻烦。关于这一点，我们要等到第9单元再讲。 +

So World War One was not the war to end all wars like everyone wanted it to be. There was in fact a World War II, and in this video we're going to look at it straight in the face. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

Now in the last video, I mentioned all the precipitating factors that led to the war, so here let's just jump straight into the fight. There were essentially two theaters of the war: there was the European theater and the Pacific theater. When I say theater of war -- maybe you don't know that terminology -- but it's not that hard to understand. Basically it means that there were two stages upon which the events of World War II unfolded: one stage here and one stage here.

So the war essentially began in the Pacific theater first, and for that we have Japan to thank. Since the last part of the 19th century in the early decades of the 20th century, Japan had risen to dominance in the Eastern world. Driven by policies of aggressive expansionism, Japan had won victories against China and then against Russia, and then gobbled up many territories in Southeast Asia. Because Japan was also gripped by fascist leadership, there was a natural affinity between them and Germany and Italy. But anyway, the war on the Pacific essentially began in 1937 when the Chinese and Japanese forces clashed over the Japanese seizure of Manchuria.

By the way, if you want help reviewing for all of this and for the national exam coming up, then check out my AP Euro review pack which has everything you need to get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. Link in description.

Anyway, over in the European theater of World War II, the war was triggered by Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Now you might recall from the last video that Britain and France had been abiding by the policy of appeasement with regards to Hitler's expansionism across Europe. But the invasion of Poland was the last straw, and with that, Britain and France declared war on Germany. And baby, you got another world war on your hands.

Now once the war started, there were two opposing sides. The Allied Powers included Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and then later the United States would join as well. The Axis powers essentially included Germany, Italy, and Japan. And the truth is, early in the war, the Axis powers seemed to be dunking on the Allied powers profoundly. And no small part of said dunking was due -- in the European theater -- to Hitler's method of attack known as blitzkrieg. It literally means lightning war because when the Germans showed up, it was like, "And we're dead." It was called this because it was a tactic designed to crush an enemy at an incredible speed using a combination of air power, tanks, and ground troops. German forces plowed through the enemy lines and then went on to terrorize the civilian populations of these countries.

Not only did this work in Eastern European countries like Poland, Yugoslavia, and Greece, but it also worked in the West too. In 1941, Hitler invaded France with these same tactics, and they were positively dazed by the Nazi attack. It wasn't long before France fell to Germany, and Mussolini over in Italy rushed to France as well to grab a piece of that sweet French pie. Now the northern part of France was under direct occupation by Germany, while a Nazi puppet government known as Vichy France was established in the south.

Then in June of 1941, Hitler turned his sights on the Soviet Union. You may remember in the last video I talked about the non-aggression pact that Hitler signed with Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union. It was an agreement that they would not attack each other. But Hitler never really intended to honor this pact -- it was just an agreement to buy him some time to conquer the rest of Europe without interference from those pesky Soviets. But in 1941, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa in which he sought to conquer the Soviet Union, which he needed for all the natural resources bound up in that land. Hitler won some early victories in this campaign, but ultimately the Soviets rallied and made any further gains very difficult. In fact, Hitler's troops got so bogged down that they were stationed there through winter -- which, if Hitler had bothered to consult Napoleon on, he would know that was a bad idea. Anyway, Germans were able to hold some Soviet territory, but they were never able to fully conquer it.

Case in point: the siege of Stalingrad during this campaign. Soviet civilians and military endured brutal conditions but would not surrender, and ultimately the Germans endured three quarters of a million casualties and were never able to control the Soviet stronghold. So all that to say, the Axis powers -- in particular Germany -- came out strong in the beginning, but eventually the tides began to turn.

Now by 1940, the only real threat to Hitler that was left on the continent was Britain. Like, no other Western state was opposing him. And under the leadership of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the British people rallied to the cause. Hitler assumed that bombing campaigns aimed at British civilian populations would so demoralize the British that they would beg their government to surrender. But those bombing raids had the opposite effect. Thanks to the bulldoggish tenacity of Churchill, he organized the resistance and gave moving speeches that roused the British people to continue the resistance.

Now I said that Britain was standing alone, but that's not entirely accurate. More accurately, Britain was the only Western country that had officially declared war on Germany that was continuing the resistance. But there was another Western country who was undeclared in war that was handily supporting the British cause, namely the United States. After World War One, Americans essentially turned into an isolationist nation with regard to European conflicts. They just needed a little me-time after the great European war. However, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt could see that if Britain fell to the Germans, that would be a bad situation for the United States. So the U.S. had been supplying the British with weapons of war through their Cash and Carry program and their Destroyers for Bases programs, etc. So even though the United States wasn't officially a belligerent in the war, it was clear to the whole world where their sympathies led.

This loyalty was abundantly clear to Japan, who realized that America's friendship with Britain would eventually bring the industrial giant into the war, and they wanted to prevent it. And so on December 7, 1941, Japanese planes bombed the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. And with that kind of aggression, the United States declared war on Japan. Germany went ahead and declared war on the United States, and now we're in.

And thanks to the fantastic industrial capacity of the United States, factories of all kinds were transformed almost overnight into factories for producing weapons of war. The amount of planes and guns and tanks and everything else the U.S. was able to muster in a short amount of time had a significant effect on the war. Additionally, a joint British-U.S. invasion of France on D-Day proved a turning point for the war in the West. After having deceived the Germans into thinking that the invasion was coming from another place, on June 6, 1944, the British and Americans executed the largest amphibious invasion in world history on the beaches of Normandy. And though they suffered heavy casualties for the effort, eventually they were successful in liberating France from Nazi occupation.

The tide began to turn in Eastern Europe thanks to the all-out effort from the Soviet Union. As I already mentioned in the siege of Stalingrad, the tide of war changed in the Pacific theater at the Battle of Midway, in which American forces dominated the Japanese Navy and then engaged in an island-hopping campaign to cut off Japanese supply lines. Ultimately, the Allies closed in on Berlin more and more, and Hitler moved his anti-semitic hind parts into a bunker, still casting blame on the Jews for all the misfortunes that Germany had suffered. Hiding down in his bunker instead of admitting defeat, he committed suicide instead. And on May 7, the German government surrendered. It became known as VE Day -- or Victory in Europe Day -- in the European theater. It was close.

But in order to talk about how the Pacific theater was closed, we need to talk about some new technology that was employed in this war. Now after the war was over, everyone counted their dead and realized that more people had died in this war than any other war -- World War One not being excepted. And a large part of that death toll was the new and devastating war technology employed, and I'll tell you about two of them.

First was the introduction of incendiary bombs. These were bombs that were casing wood housing that were meant not only to explode but to start fires. In the firebombing of Tokyo carried out by the U.S. Air Force, 16 square miles of Tokyo were burned in the fire, and a hundred thousand people were left dead. And then British and American planes did the same thing to Dresden in Germany, and though only about a quarter of that number died there, it was still absolutely devastating.

But perhaps the most devastating technology introduced in World War II was the atomic bomb. This was a bomb created by the Americans that was able to destabilize atoms and release the destructive energy that came as a result of that destabilization. A single nuclear bomb was capable of delivering the explosive force of about 20,000 tons of dynamite. And so in order to close the Pacific theater of war, the United States dropped two of these bombs on Japan: one in Hiroshima and the other in Nagasaki. And between the two of these bombs, both cities were destroyed, and somewhere between a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand were killed. Several days after the second bomb was dropped, Japan surrendered in what became known as VJ Day -- or Victory in Japan Day.

Now don't get me wrong, it was great that the war was over. But in truth, the introduction of nuclear weapons is going to cause a lot of trouble going forward. But for that, we'll have to wait for Unit Nine.
