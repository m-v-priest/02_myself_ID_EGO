Now back at the beginning of AP Euro, Europe was basically united by Jesus. The Roman Catholic Church basically held Europe together socially and politically. But then the Protestant Reformation 新教改革 occurred, and since then Europe just fought each other ad nauseam 令人作呕地；不厌其烦地. But in this video, we're going to see how in the 20th century -- after 500 years of fighting -- Europe finally came together again with the establishment of the European Union. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now it's no surprise that after two giant world wars, European states would be looking for a way not to get embroiled in 卷入；陷入 another giant war. In other words, what we've been doing hasn't worked, so let's figure out something else that might lead to peaceful cooperation among European states. Now eventually this push will lead to the establishment of the European Union, but first let's consider the steps it took to get there. +

And as with so many other things, the steps to cooperation were at first economic. When the United States decided to pump 注入；投入 13 billion dollars into the rebuilding of Europe under the auspices of 在……的支持下；由……主办 the Marshall Plan 马歇尔计划, that money came with a stipulation 规定；条款 -- namely that that money be spent cooperatively 合作地. So for example, France couldn't take Marshall Plan funds and build up a big military and go blow up Germany. No, these funds were granted to European states who agreed to give each other a warm hug. +

And speaking of warm hugs, if you're feeling cold and alone with this national AP exam coming up, then you might want to find your way to the embrace of my AP Euro review pack, which is everything you need to absolutely crush 击败；战胜 that exam. Link in the description. Anyway, the first real step toward further economic cooperation was the establishment of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation 欧洲经济合作组织, which was the body that organized the disbursement 支出；支付 and spending of the Marshall Plan funds. It worked out pretty well. +

The next significant step into the economic unification 统一 of Europe came from the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community 欧洲煤钢共同体, which was formed in 1951. It was an agreement between six states to integrate 使一体化；使融合 their steel and coal operations, and those six states included France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The economic union was quickly profitable for all of them involved, and the idea was that if member nations were tied together economically, it would therefore be unthinkable 不可思议的；难以想象的 for them to go to war with one another. +

So as these independent nations worked together to become a kind of singular economic bloc 经济集团, they began reaping 获得；收获 fabulous 极好的；巨大的 profits as a result of their cooperation. Because this worked so well, the six member nations signed a treaty in 1957 to expand the relationship to include goods beyond coal and steel, and the result was the Common Market 共同市场, which was similarly successful. Over the course of the 20th century, more European nations joined this cooperative, and the integration 一体化 of various state economies into a single European economy was slowly occurring. +

This agreement meant that trade restrictions 贸易限制 between European states were almost nil 零；没有, and in light of 鉴于；由于 this cooperation, the economic agreement later expanded into allowing citizens of all of those states to travel freely between them without the need of a passport. And that brings us to 1993 when the Maastricht Treaty 马斯特里赫特条约 was signed, which officially created the European Union. It was originally signed by 12 countries, and there were more to come. +

But this wasn't just an economic integration 一体化 of Europe -- it also had political ramifications 影响；后果 as well. Because the economic blending 融合 of Common Market nations had gone so well, the European Union added some political blending as well. And once the EU was a reality, they established seven bodies that would make policy for EU member nations, including a parliament 议会, an executive body 执行机构, a group of ministers who considered issues like defense and foreign policy. +

Additionally, an international currency called the euro 欧元 was introduced to member nations. No longer would the French use the franc 法郎 or the Italians use the lira 里拉 -- now everyone was using the euro. And this further knit together 使紧密结合；使团结 the member nations. But not everything is puppies and rainbows when it comes to membership in the European Union, and every problem they face basically comes down to a tension that exists along a single axis 轴线；核心问题. And the question is: how do we balance questions of national sovereignty 国家主权 versus 与……相比；而 responsibilities to the union? +

On the one hand, national sovereignty is the idea that each state is its own state with its own interests, and they don't want to give up their distinction 独特性；特殊性 to this union. On the other hand, each state is a member of a union which is arguably 可以说；按理说 stronger economically and politically than they would be alone -- or at least, you know, that's how the argument goes. +

Perhaps the most recent visible manifestation 表现；显示 of this tension came with Great Britain's exit from the European Union in 2016, known as Brexit 英国脱欧. There were a lot of factors that drove this decision, but one of the major driving factors was the EU's very favorable policies towards immigration. Many Brits were growing tired of the growing immigrant population that'd be fair. Great Britain was always an uncomfortable member of the EU, and talks about leaving had begun occurring almost as soon as they joined. +

== 中文释义

在AP欧洲史的开篇，欧洲基本上是由耶稣维系在一起的。罗马天主教会基本上在社会和政治层面将欧洲凝聚起来。但随后"新教改革"发生了，从那以后，欧洲各国就陷入了令人厌烦的相互争斗之中。但在这个视频里，我们将看到在20世纪，在经历了500年的争斗之后，欧洲最终又通过"欧盟"（the European Union）的建立重新走到了一起。所以如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

毫不奇怪，**#在经历了两次世界大战之后，欧洲各国开始寻找一种避免卷入另一场大战的方法。#**换句话说，我们之前所做的并没有奏效，所以让我们找出其他能让欧洲各国实现和平合作的办法。最终，**#这种努力导致了"欧盟"的建立，#**但首先让我们看看实现这一目标所经历的步骤。 +

和许多其他事情一样，**走向合作的第一步, 是先经济层面的。**当美国根据马歇尔计划（the Marshall Plan）决定向欧洲重建投入130亿美元时，这笔钱有一个规定 —— 即这些钱要以"合作"的方式使用。例如，法国不能拿着马歇尔计划的资金, 来扩充军队然后去攻打德国。不，这些资金是提供给那些同意相互友好合作的欧洲国家的。 +

说到友好合作，如果你因为即将到来的全国AP考试而感到孤独无助，那么你可能想要投入我的AP欧洲史复习资料包的怀抱，它包含了你在考试中取得优异成绩所需的一切。简介里有链接。不管怎样，**迈向进一步经济合作的第一个真正步骤, 是建立"欧洲经济合作组织"（the Organization for European Economic Cooperation），这个组织负责马歇尔计划资金的分配和使用。**效果相当不错。 +

**欧洲经济统一的下一个重要步骤, 是欧"洲煤钢共同体"（the European Coal and Steel Community）的成立，**它于1951年成立。这是六个国家之间的一项协议，目的是整合它们的钢铁和煤炭业务，这六个国家包括法国、西德（West Germany）、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡。这个经济联盟让所有参与国迅速获利，*#其理念是，如果成员国在经济上相互绑定，那么它们相互开战将是不可想象的 (中美经济互相深层绑定, 就不太可能开战. 脱钩, 则容易开战)。#* +

所以当这些独立的国家合作成为一个单一的经济集团时，它们开始从合作中获得巨大的利润。因为这种合作效果很好，六个成员国在1957年签署了一项条约，**将合作关系, 扩展到煤炭和钢铁之外的商品领域，结果就是"共同市场"（the Common Market）的建立，**共同市场也取得了成功。在20世纪的进程中，更多的欧洲国家加入了这个合作组织，各个国家的经济逐渐整合为单一的欧洲经济。 +

**这项协议意味着欧洲各国之间的"贸易限制"几乎消失了，**鉴于这种合作，**后来的经济协议进一步扩展，允许所有这些国家的公民在彼此之间自由旅行, 而无需护照。**这就说到了**1993年，《马斯特里赫特条约》（the Maastricht Treaty）签署，正式创建了欧盟。**最初有12个国家签署了该条约，后来还有更多国家加入。 +

**但这不仅仅是欧洲的经济一体化 —— 它也有政治方面的影响。**因为共同市场国家的经济融合进展得非常顺利，*##欧盟也在"政治"上进行了一些融合。##一旦欧盟成为现实，他们建立了七个机构，为欧盟成员国制定政策，#这些机构包括一个议会、一个执行机构，以及一群负责国防和外交政策等问题的部长。#* +

此外，一种名为"欧元"（the euro）的国际货币被引入到成员国中。法国人不再使用法郎，意大利人不再使用里拉 —— 现在每个人都使用欧元。这进一步将成员国紧密联系在一起。**但在欧盟成员国的问题上，**并非一切都那么美好，*他们面临的每个问题基本上都归结为一个核心矛盾。#问题是：我们如何平衡国家主权问题, 与对联盟的责任呢 (集集权与分权的平衡, 正如美国各州与联邦的关系, 如何平衡)？#* +

*一方面，国家主权的概念, 是每个国家都是独立的，有着自己的利益，它们不想放弃自己的独特性而融入联盟。另一方面，每个国家都是联盟的成员，从理论上讲，联盟在经济和政治上比单个国家更强大 —— 至少，争论是这样的。* +

这种矛盾最近最明显的表现, 是**英国在2016年决定退出欧盟，即 “脱欧”**（Brexit）。促成这一决定的因素有很多，但**一个主要因素是欧盟非常宽松的移民政策。许多英国人对不断增长的移民人口感到厌倦，**这也是合理的。英国在欧盟中一直是一个不太自在的成员国，几乎从加入欧盟起就开始有退出的讨论。 +

不管怎样，英国脱欧, 是成员国在"维护自身独立和身份"的愿望, 与"统一的政治经济体系带来的好处"之间, 矛盾的一个很好的例子。所以由于移民问题, 以及一系列其他过于复杂在此不做详述的因素，英国在2020年正式脱离了欧盟。 +

Many Brits were growing tired of the growing immigrant population that'd be fair. Great Britain was always an uncomfortable member of the EU, and talks about leaving had begun occurring almost as soon as they joined.

Regardless, Brexit is a good example of the tension between member states' desire to maintain their independence and identity and the benefits of a unified political economic system. So because of the immigration issue and a whole host of other factors that are too complicated to get into here, the United Kingdom officially left the EU in 2020.
