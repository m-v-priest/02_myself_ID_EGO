== 释义

So in the time period 1648 to 1815, England is going to become the biggest deal 最重要的事物；最有影响力的事物 there is in Europe. So in this video for AP Euro Unit 5, we need to figure out 弄清楚；搞明白 how they did it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So `主` the first way 方法，手段 England became the big cheese 重要人物；大亨 in Europe `系` was by *uniting* (v.)联合；合并 under _one monarchical 君主制的；君主的 banner_ 旗帜 *with* Scotland. _The Acts of Union_ were passed (v.) both by the English and the Scottish parliaments 议会 in 1707, and that created a new entity 实体 called _the United Kingdom of Great Britain_. +

Now, a few years later by 1715, _the Treaty of Utrecht_ was signed (v.) which ended (v.) the War of Spanish Succession 继承. We've talked about that in other videos, so I won't *go into* 深入研究;详细叙述；深入探讨 it here.  +
But essentially 基本上；本质上, that war left (v.) France, the Dutch Republic, and Spain #**gasping （尤指由于惊讶或疼痛而）喘气，喘息，倒抽气 for** 渴望，很想要（尤指饮料或香烟） breath 想要喘气,喘不过气来# /and seriously weakened (v.)削弱；减弱 economically 经济上地. And that was great 很好地，很棒地 for Britain, because France -- especially France -- was Britain's chief (a.)主要的；首要的 rival 对手；敌手 during this time. +


[.my2]
但从本质上讲，这场战争让法国、荷兰共和国和西班牙喘不过气来，严重削弱了经济。这对英国来说是件好事，因为法国——尤其是法国——是这一时期英国的主要对手。

With France busy (a.) figuring out 解决 their own problems, Britain became arguably 可论证地；可争辩地 the most powerful state 国家 in Europe. But you didn't think _the rivalry 竞争；对抗 between Britain and France_ was over now, did you? So crazy -- *not even close* 差得远;甚至还没有接近. +

So now I need to introduce you to the second means 方法；手段 by which Great Britain became so powerful, and that was *because of* the Seven Years' War -- which technically 严格意义上；确切地说 lasted (v.) six years, eight months, four weeks, and a day. Okay, but that's not *as snappy* (a.)漂亮入时的,精练的；简洁的  of a title *as* "the Seven Years' War." +

So first, let's put this conflict 冲突；争执 in context 背景. Recall 记起；回忆起 that _Frederick II of Prussia_ -- *also known as* Frederick the Great -- had seized 夺取；占领 the Austrian territory 领土；地区 of Silesia, and in that act sparked (v.)引发；触发 _the War of Austrian Succession_ which lasted (v.) from 1740 to 1748. Because of alliances 联盟；同盟 between European states, this quickly became__ a much bigger war__ that also included Britain and France, who seized much of each other's territory across their colonial empires 帝国. +

Now, by the end of the war, the _peace treaty_ 和平条约 #stipulated (v.)规定；约定# that /`主` all that territory 后定 seized `谓` be returned to their original owner. But Frederick II of Prussia refused *to return Silesia to Austria* -- a move 行动；举措 which virtually 几乎；差不多 guaranteed (v.)保证；确保 another war. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.stipulate
-> 来自拉丁语 stipulari,交易，订约，达成条款，可能##来自 stipula,草梗，叶柄，茎，##来自 PIE*steip, 刺，词源同 stipule,stipple.其词义演变来自古罗马时期谈判双方达成协议后，会折断一根草 作为象征。这种行为可能类似武侠小说中把箭折断，然后立下重誓言语##“如违此誓，有如此 箭（剑）##”，参照《天龙八部》相关章节。


====

So because of the lingering  (a.)拖延的，迟迟不结束的 tension 紧张局势；紧张状态 over Silesia, _Maria Theresa_, the Austrian monarch 君主；帝王, established new diplomatic 外交的 alliances /and *broke apart* 分裂；解散 old ones. With this new system of alliances formed (v.), the stage *was set for* 为…做好准备 the Seven Years' War, which would *be waged* (v.)进行（战争、运动等） in Europe, India, and North America -- which is why some historians 历史学家 argue that /it was truly the first world war. +

So let's consider (v.) each of _the #theaters 战场；战区# of war_ 战区, and that'll help you see how Britain *came out on top* 出类拔萃,名列前茅；获胜. +

First was the European theater 战场；战区. The fighting in Europe centered (v.) in Prussia, who *was allied 与…结盟 with* Great Britain. And though Frederick II *fought (v.) pretty decently* 尚可地；不错地, he was surrounded (v.)围绕；包围 on three sides by Austrians, Russians, and the French.  +
But _Frederick's bacon 培根，烟熏咸肉片;性命、人身安全 was saved_ by the #ascension 上升；升高；登上;登基；即位# of Peter III to the throne 王位；宝座 of Russia, who -- being a great admirer 爱慕者；赞赏者；钦佩者 of Frederick ("Dude 家伙，小子, I love you") -- *called off* 取消；停止 Russian troops 军队. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Frederick’s bacon was saved

​"Bacon"​​ 直译为​​“培根”​​（猪肉制品），但在这里是​​英语俚语​​，指 ​​“性命、人身安全”​​ 或 ​​“重要利益”​​。 +

- 中世纪的欧洲，猪肉（尤其是腌制的培根）是重要的食物来源，​​“拯救某人的培根”​​（save one's bacon）比喻​​“保住生存所需”​​，后来引申为​​“救某人的命”​​或​​“挽救危局”​​。 +
- 另一种理论认为，"bacon" 可能源自拉丁语 ​​"baco"​​（背部），暗指​​“从危险中脱身”​​（如敌人砍向背部时被救）。

"Save one’s bacon"​​ = ​​“救某人的命”​​/​​“帮某人脱险”​​（非正式表达）。
====


And by 1763, all parties 各方 in the war were exhausted (a.)疲惫不堪的 and ceased (v.)停止；终止 fighting, while Austria #relinquished (v.)（尤指不情愿地）放弃；让出# claims 所有权 over Silesia. So *in terms of* 就…而言 Great Britain's #ascendancy (n.)优势；支配地位#, the European theater 战场 didn't do much. +

[.my2]
到1763年，战争各方都筋疲力尽，停止了战斗，奥地利放弃了对西里西亚的主权。所以就英国的优势而言，欧洲战场并没有发挥多大作用。

[.my1]
.案例

.relinquish
-> 来自拉丁语 relinquere,留下，留给，来自 ##re-,向后，往回，linquere,留下，留给，##词源同 delinquency,relic.引申诸相关词义。

But now let's consider (v.) _the South Asian theater_ of war. In India, Britain and France struggled (v.) mightily 强烈地；竭尽全力地 for *control (v.) over* India. France seized (v.) Madras in the War of Austrian Succession, and that was a big deal 重要的事 because Madras was the center of _British imperial 帝国的 control_ in India. +

But as I mentioned (v.) earlier, _the Treaty of Utrecht_ *#mandated (v.)强制执行；命令;授权# that* `主` all the seized land `谓` be returned, and thus Madras *returned to* British control. But now /as the conflict *erupted (v.)爆发 again* in the Seven Years' War, Britain and France began tangling (v.)纠缠；混战 once again over India. They did this /mainly by supporting (v.) rival 竞争的；敌对的 Indian princes  王子；诸侯. But ultimately 最终；最后, the British *won out* 获胜, and the French withdrew (v.)撤出；撤离 from India, leaving (v.) Britain in control. +

So Britain has India, and that puts (v.) a big _fat (a.)肥的，巨额的 check_ 丰厚的支票 in _the British #ascendancy (n.)优势；支配地位；影响# column_ 栏；列. +

But `主` _the most decisive 决定性的 victory_ for the British in the Seven Years' War  `系` was in the North American theater. And there, the conflict *was known as* the French and Indian War. +

So the prime minister 首相 of Britain, William Pitt the Elder, understood that `主` the greatest #impediment (n.)障碍；阻碍# to the expansion 扩张；扩大 of Britain's empire `系` was the massive (a.)巨大的；大量的 French colonial empire. Therefore, Pitt *concentrated* (v.)集中（注意力、精力等） much of Britain's resources *into* this theater of war. +

It was called _the French and Indian War_ /because the French *allied (v.) with* North American Indians, who *saw* the French traders *as* less of a threat 威胁 to _their way of life_ 他们的生活方式 *than* the British settlers 移民 -- who just couldn't seem *to satisfy (v.)满足 their deep, gaping (a.)（洞）豁开的；（伤口）敞开的；（嘴巴）张大的 want-holes* with enough land. +

[.my2]
这场战争被称为"法印战争"，因为法国人与北美印第安人结盟，他们认为法国商人对他们的生活方式的威胁, 比英国殖民者要小——英国殖民者似乎无法用足够的土地来满足他们深而大的欲望.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Gaping want-holes
- ​gaping​​（形容词）：​​“裂开的、张着大口的”​​（形容空洞、贪婪或无法满足的状态）。
- ​want-hole​​（合成俚语,生造词）： +
​​"want"​​ = 欲望 +
​​"hole"​​ = 洞 → 比喻​​“永远填不满的欲望深渊”​​。

"deep, gaping want-holes"​​ = ​​“深不见底的欲望之洞”​​

====

So despite 尽管 the early successes from the French, the British Navy *ended up* 最终；结果 pounding (v.)连续重击 them, and eventually the British won. +

_As a result of_ the Treaty of Paris, which ended (v.) the war, Britain gained _a metric butt-load of 大量的 land_ from France's colonial empire, including large parts of Canada and all the land 后定说明 east of the Mississippi River. Additionally 此外, Spain -- who was France's ally 盟友 in the war -- *ceded* (v.)割让;屈服；让与 Florida *to* the British as well. +

*Now that* 既然，由于 the Seven Years' War *had come to an end* 结束, out of _the smoking rubble_ (（倒塌的墙或建筑留下的）瓦砾，碎石) 冒烟的瓦砾, Britain became the world's greatest superpower 超级大国. +

But you didn't think that /Britain and France were done fighting, did you? So crazy. +

[.my2]
但你不认为英法之间的战争已经结束了，是吗？

In 1776, Britain's North American colonies 殖民地 *decided that* they wanted independence 独立, and that *led to* 导致 the American Revolution. Now remember (v.), Britain is the world's most powerful nation at this time. Do you really think _these #fledgling （刚会飞的）幼鸟;新兴的；初出茅庐的# little colonies_ *stand (v.) a chance* 有机会；有希望 后定说明 against those odds （事物发生的）可能性，机会；困难，不利条件；投注赔率；（力量、权力或资源上的）优势? +

The answer is no. _There is no way_ that 13 British colonies are going to win (v.) against Britain. +

Yes, the American colonists 殖民者 were well *aware (a.) of* 意识到 this long-lasting 持久的；长期的 rivalry (n.)竞争，较量 between Britain and France, and thus #courted (v.)寻求；设法获得;法院；法庭# France to come /help (v.) *throw Britain off of its back* 摆脱英国的控制.   +
And look, France didn't help /because they, you know, read (v.) _the Declaration of Independence_ and were like, "Oh my, our hearts *beat (v.) fast* at _this call (n.) for liberty_!" (That's not even _a French accent_ 口音，腔调. What was that?) +

== 中文释义

**所以在1648年到1815年这段时间里，英格兰将成为欧洲最有影响力的国家。**所以在美国大学预修课程欧洲历史第五单元的这个视频中，我们需要弄清楚他们是如何做到这一点的。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

英格兰成为欧洲的主导国家的第一个原因, 是与苏格兰在君主制的旗帜下联合起来。1707年，英格兰和苏格兰议会都通过了《联合法案》，这创造了一个新的实体，即大不列颠联合王国。  +

几年后的1715年，《乌得勒支条约》签署，结束了"西班牙王位继承战争"。我们在其他视频中谈到过这场战争，所以我在这里就不详细说了。但从本质上说，那场战争让法国、荷兰共和国和西班牙都喘不过气来，经济上也受到了严重削弱。这对英国来说是件好事，因为法国——尤其是法国——在这个时期是英国的主要竞争对手。  +

法国忙于解决自己的问题，英国可以说成为了欧洲最强大的国家。但你不会认为英法之间的竞争就此结束了，对吧？太疯狂了——远没有结束。  +

所以现在我要告诉你**大不列颠变得如此强大的第二个原因，那就是七年战争**——严格来说，这场战争持续了六年零八个月零四周又一天。好吧，但“七年战争”这个名字更顺口。  +

首先，让我们来了解一下这场冲突的背景。还记得普鲁士的腓特烈二世——也就是腓特烈大帝——夺取了奥地利的西里西亚领土，这引发了**从1740年到1748年的奥地利王位继承战争。由于欧洲各国之间的联盟，这场战争很快变成了一场更大的战争(就如同一战一样, 双方联盟, 把各自联盟国家都拉下水, 结果变成了世界大战)，英国和法国也参与其中，他们在各自的殖民帝国中夺取了对方的很多领土。**  +

战争结束时，和平条约规定所有被占领的领土都要归还原主。但普鲁士的腓特烈二世拒绝将西里西亚归还给奥地利——这一举动几乎注定会引发另一场战争。  +

由于西里西亚问题引发的紧张局势持续存在，奥地利君主玛丽亚·特蕾莎建立了新的外交联盟，并打破了旧的联盟。*随着这个新的联盟体系的形成，七年战争的舞台搭建起来了，这场战争将在欧洲、印度和北美展开——这就是为什么一些历史学家认为这才是真正的第一次世界大战。*  +

所以让我们来分析一下各个战场，这将帮助你了解英国是如何脱颖而出的。  +

第一个是欧洲战场。欧洲的战斗, 主要集中在与英国结盟的普鲁士。虽然腓特烈二世打得相当不错，但他被奥地利人、俄国人和法国人从三个方向包围。但彼得三世登上俄国皇位, 救了腓特烈的命，彼得三世是腓特烈的超级粉丝（“老兄，我爱你”），他下令撤回了俄国军队。  +

到1763年，战争各方都疲惫不堪，停止了战斗，而奥地利放弃了对西里西亚的主权要求。所以就英国的崛起而言，欧洲战场并没有起到太大作用。  +

但现在让我们来看看**南亚战场。在印度，英国和法国为控制印度, 展开了激烈的争夺。**在奥地利王位继承战争中，法国占领了马德拉斯，这是一件大事，因为马德拉斯是英国在印度的帝国控制中心。  +

但正如我之前提到的，**《乌得勒支条约》规定, 所有被占领的土地都要归还，因此马德拉斯又回到了英国的控制之下。但现在随着"七年战争"中冲突再次爆发，英国和法国又开始在印度纠缠不清。**他们主要通过支持印度的敌对王公来进行争夺。但**最终，英国获胜，法国撤出了印度，让英国控制了印度。**  +

所以英国控制了印度，这为英国的崛起增添了重要的一笔。  +

但英国在"七年战争"中最具决定性的胜利, 是在北美战场。在那里，这场冲突被称为"法印战争"。  +

英国首相老威廉·皮特（William Pitt the Elder）明白，英国帝国扩张的最大障碍, 是庞大的法国殖民帝国。因此，皮特将英国的大量资源集中投入到这个战场。  +

之所以称为"法印战争"，是因为法国与北美印第安人结盟，*北美印第安人认为, 法国商人对他们生活方式的威胁, 比英国定居者要小——英国定居者似乎永远无法满足他们对土地的强烈渴望。*  +

所以尽管法国在战争初期取得了一些成功，但英国海军最终重创了他们，最终英国获胜。  +

*作为结束这场战争的《巴黎条约》的结果，英国从法国的殖民帝国那里, 获得了大量土地，包括加拿大的大部分地区, 以及密西西比河以东的所有土地。此外，在战争中作为法国盟友的西班牙, 也把佛罗里达割让给了英国。*  +

随着**七年战争的结束，**从一片废墟中崛起的英国, 成为了世界上最强大的超级大国。  +

**但你不会认为英法之间的战斗就此结束了，对吧？**太疯狂了。  +

**1776年，英国在北美的殖民地决定寻求独立，这引发了美国独立战争。**记住，此时英国是世界上最强大的国家。你真的认为这些新生的殖民地有机会战胜英国吗？  +

答案是否定的。13个英国殖民地根本没有办法战胜英国。  +

哦，但法国来拯救局面了。  +

是的，美国殖民者清楚地知道, 英法之间长期存在的竞争，因此他们争取法国的帮助, 来摆脱英国的统治。听着，**#法国提供帮助, 可不是因为他们读了《独立宣言》#**然后说：“哦，我的天，这个对自由的呼吁, 让我们心跳加速！”（那甚至不是法国口音。那是什么呀？）  +

不，他们就像受伤的小学生一样，*想向英国复仇。*  +

在法国的帮助下，美国殖民地成功击败了英国。但即便如此，这并没有大大削弱英国的实力。他们仍然是世界上最强大的超级大国。  +

So in the time period 1648 to 1815, England is going to become the biggest deal there is in Europe. So in this video for AP Euro Unit 5, we need to figure out how they did it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

So the first way England became the big cheese in Europe was by uniting under one monarchical banner with Scotland. The Acts of Union were passed both by the English and the Scottish parliaments in 1707, and that created a new entity called the United Kingdom of Great Britain.

Now, a few years later by 1715, the Treaty of Utrecht was signed which ended the War of Spanish Succession. We've talked about that in other videos, so I won't go into it here. But essentially, that war left France, the Dutch Republic, and Spain gasping for breath and seriously weakened economically. And that was great for Britain, because France -- especially France -- was Britain's chief rival during this time.

With France busy figuring out their own problems, Britain became arguably the most powerful state in Europe. But you didn't think the rivalry between Britain and France was over now, did you? So crazy -- not even close.

So now I need to introduce you to the second means by which Great Britain became so powerful, and that was because of the Seven Years' War -- which technically lasted six years, eight months, four weeks, and a day. Okay, but that's not as snappy of a title as "the Seven Years' War."

So first, let's put this conflict in context. Recall that Frederick II of Prussia -- also known as Frederick the Great -- had seized the Austrian territory of Silesia, and in that act sparked the War of Austrian Succession which lasted from 1740 to 1748. Because of alliances between European states, this quickly became a much bigger war that also included Britain and France, who seized much of each other's territory across their colonial empires.

Now, by the end of the war, the peace treaty stipulated that all that territory seized be returned to their original owner. But Frederick II of Prussia refused to return Silesia to Austria -- a move which virtually guaranteed another war.

So because of the lingering tension over Silesia, Maria Theresa, the Austrian monarch, established new diplomatic alliances and broke apart old ones. With this new system of alliances formed, the stage was set for the Seven Years' War, which would be waged in Europe, India, and North America -- which is why some historians argue that it was truly the first world war.

So let's consider each of the theaters of war, and that'll help you see how Britain came out on top.

First was the European theater. The fighting in Europe centered in Prussia, who was allied with Great Britain. And though Frederick II fought pretty decently, he was surrounded on three sides by Austrians, Russians, and the French. But Frederick's bacon was saved by the ascension of Peter III to the throne of Russia, who -- being a great admirer of Frederick ("Dude, I love you") -- called off Russian troops.

And by 1763, all parties in the war were exhausted and ceased fighting, while Austria relinquished claims over Silesia. So in terms of Great Britain's ascendancy, the European theater didn't do much.

But now let's consider the South Asian theater of war. In India, Britain and France struggled mightily for control over India. France seized Madras in the War of Austrian Succession, and that was a big deal because Madras was the center of British imperial control in India.

But as I mentioned earlier, the Treaty of Utrecht mandated that all the seized land be returned, and thus Madras returned to British control. But now as the conflict erupted again in the Seven Years' War, Britain and France began tangling once again over India. They did this mainly by supporting rival Indian princes. But ultimately, the British won out, and the French withdrew from India, leaving Britain in control.

So Britain has India, and that puts a big fat check in the British ascendancy column.

But the most decisive victory for the British in the Seven Years' War was in the North American theater. And there, the conflict was known as the French and Indian War.

So the prime minister of Britain, William Pitt the Elder, understood that the greatest impediment to the expansion of Britain's empire was the massive French colonial empire. Therefore, Pitt concentrated much of Britain's resources into this theater of war.

It was called the French and Indian War because the French allied with North American Indians, who saw the French traders as less of a threat to their way of life than the British settlers -- who just couldn't seem to satisfy their deep, gaping want-holes with enough land.

So despite the early successes from the French, the British Navy ended up pounding them, and eventually the British won.

As a result of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war, Britain gained a metric butt-load of land from France's colonial empire, including large parts of Canada and all the land east of the Mississippi River. Additionally, Spain -- who was France's ally in the war -- ceded Florida to the British as well.

Now that the Seven Years' War had come to an end, out of the smoking rubble, Britain became the world's greatest superpower.

But you didn't think that Britain and France were done fighting, did you? So crazy.

In 1776, Britain's North American colonies decided that they wanted independence, and that led to the American Revolution. Now remember, Britain is the world's most powerful nation at this time. Do you really think these fledgling little colonies stand a chance against those odds?

The answer is no. There is no way that 13 British colonies are going to win against Britain.

Oh, but here comes France to save the day.

Yes, the American colonists were well aware of this long-lasting rivalry between Britain and France, and thus courted France to come help throw Britain off of its back. And look, France didn't help because they, you know, read the Declaration of Independence and were like, "Oh my, our hearts beat fast at this call for liberty!" (That's not even a French accent. What was that?)

No, like an injured schoolchild, they wanted revenge on Britain.

With France's help, the American colonies successfully defeated the British. But even so, that didn't much diminish the power of Great Britain. They were still the world's greatest superpower.
