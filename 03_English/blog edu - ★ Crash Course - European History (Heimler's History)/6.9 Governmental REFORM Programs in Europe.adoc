If you had lived in London in the early 19th century, it would have been what historians referred to as a state. There wasn't any indoor plumbing 室内管道系统, and so people did their business and threw it out the window, and it washed away into the River Thames. And as it turns out, it's not a great solution for a whole city to hurl 投掷；扔 their grumpies (这里可能是一种不太正式的说法，可理解为“排泄物”等) into the main source of drinking water. So what to do, what to do? +

Well, Big Daddy government is going to get involved and start fixing this problem and many other problems quick, fast, and in a hurry. So let's consider how governments began to play a bigger role in people's lives during this period of European history. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now in the decades and centuries preceding 在…之前 the Industrial Revolution, those in power essentially wanted governments to stay out of their business. And this is a core idea of liberalism 自由主义 -- namely 即；也就是 that the government should operate according to a laissez-faire 自由放任的 policy. That's just a French word that means "leave alone" or "let alone." +

But in the middle of the 19th century, with the significant problems of overcrowding 过度拥挤 and crime created by urbanization 城市化, people began to demand liberal reforms of their government. In other words, people wanted the government to get involved in solving their problems -- to go from laissez-faire to interventionist 干预主义的. +

You see, as capitalistic 资本主义的 societies grew more complex, it was no longer practical nor desirable for many citizens that the government stay completely out of things. Rather, the government was now seen as the chief mover 主要推动者 of social reform. +

Now let me give you some examples of the kinds of reform enacted 颁布；制定法律 by governments during this period. And let's begin with the reforms in public health. Edwin Chadwick of Britain sought reform for the poor. In his estimation 估计；评价, one of the most significant factors of the poor remaining poor was disease. +

After studying the situation thoroughly, he found that diseases were transmitted 传播 among the poor in such high numbers because of their filthy 肮脏的 and unsanitary 不卫生的 living environment. This became the basis of Britain's first Public Health legislation 立法, by which Britain built modern sanitary 卫生的 systems, including sewers 下水道 and clean water systems. +

Those reforms were massively popular among the peeps (这里可理解为“民众”). The British Parliament 议会 continued enacting reforms because they were popular, and the working class began to trust their government more and decrease the possibility of violent class struggles. Additionally, since many of these reforms were the policies of Britain's Liberal Party 自由党, they grew to have a majority 多数 in the parliament by 1906. +

Second, government pushed for reform in terms of urban planning 城市规划. Napoleon III charged 委托；指控 Georges Haussmann with essentially tearing down 拆除 the old Paris and building it new. The old Paris was overcrowded in the extreme, and especially in the poor sections, disease ran rampant 猖獗的. +

Over the course of 20 years, Haussmann plowed down 推倒 nearly every building in Paris. He widened boulevards 林荫大道 significantly, which in addition to creating more open space also meant that the revolutionaries couldn't build their barricades 路障 so easily. Sorry, guys. +

Anyway, Haussmann built two massive public parks -- one on the rich side of town and one on the poor side of town. Additionally, the city installed sewers and aqueducts 水道；沟渠 to help mitigate 减轻；缓和 disease. And as a result of his magnificent success, the new Paris became a model for new ventures 冒险；尝试 in urban planning all throughout Europe. +

Third, governments developed professional police forces 专业警察部队. Because of the terrific overcrowding in industrial cities, it was no longer tenable 站得住脚的；可行的 to keep order with just a few officers hired by local people. So in the mid-19th century, governments began training and hiring professional police forces to keep the peace. +

And related to this, governments began to reform their prison systems 监狱系统 as well. Motivated by the work of reformers like Elizabeth Fry in Britain, prisons were now segregated 隔离；分开 by gender, and inmates 囚犯 were given opportunities for education and employment. +

And the important point to remember here is this: these reforms were led by governments, although they were inspired by public opinion 公众舆论, prominent 著名的；杰出的 individuals, and charity organizations 慈善组织. +

Now between 1870 and 1914, the majority of European governments passed compulsory education 义务教育 laws to get boys and girls between the ages of 6 to 12 into school. If you're watching this video, you are an inheritor 继承者 of those fair laws. And you may be wondering, why did they do that? +

Well, governments passed compulsory education laws for basically three reasons. First, they passed these to keep public order 公共秩序. Remember what we've seen in previous videos regarding children -- namely that an increasing amount of laws were being passed that made it illegal for them to work below a certain age. +

If you got a bunch of children running around with no jobs and nothing to do but cause trouble, well then you know -- stick them in public school and order's restored. +

The second reason governments passed these laws was because they deemed 认为 schools to be a prime 主要的；首要的 environment to engender 产生；引起 nationalism 民族主义 in their young people. For most states, public education was seen as a way to shape a generation of children into patriots 爱国者 for their state, with everyone learning the same language and the same history. +

This had the effect of creating a more integrated 融合的；整合的 population. +

And the third reason governments passed these laws was for economic growth 经济增长. In the midst of the Second Industrial Revolution, high-paying jobs were becoming more technical and more specialized 专业化的. Therefore, compulsory education prepared students to be more suited for those kinds of jobs. +

So a good example of this kind of reform was the development of kindergartens 幼儿园 in Germany. Now kindergarten was the brainchild 心血结晶；独创的观念 of German reformer Friedrich Fröbel. He believed that very young children ought to be educated primarily through play. +

And to that end, he established kindergartens that provided opportunity for children to build with geometric 几何的 blocks and engage in play-based activities. Now the revolution of 1848 in the German states caused the government to shut down these kindergartens, but by then the idea had spread to other European states who implemented 实施；执行 them with some success. +

== 中文释义

如果你在19世纪初生活在伦敦，那情况就如历史学家所描述的那样。当时没有室内管道设施(如排污水道)，所以人们处理个人事务后, 就把排泄物扔出窗外，然后这些东西就被冲进了泰晤士河（River Thames）。事实证明，对于整个城市来说，把排泄物扔进主要饮用水源, 并不是一个好的解决办法。那么该怎么办呢？  +

嗯，政府这个大家长就要介入, 并迅速开始解决这个问题, 以及其他许多问题。所以让我们来看看在欧洲历史的这个时期，政府是如何开始在人们的生活中发挥更大作用的。如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

*在工业革命前的几个世纪里，掌权者基本上希望政府不要干涉他们的事务。这是"自由主义"（liberalism）的核心思想——即政府应实行"自由放任政策"*（laissez-faire policy）。“laissez-faire” 是一个法语单词，意思是 “不干涉” 或 “放任”。  +

但在**19世纪中期，随着城市化带来的人口过度拥挤和犯罪等重大问题，**人们开始要求政府进行自由主义改革。换句话说，*人们希望政府介入解决他们的问题——从自由放任, 转变为"干预主义"。*  +

你看，随着资本主义社会变得更加复杂，对于许多公民来说，政府完全不干预事务, 既不现实, 也不可取。*相反，政府现在被视为"社会改革"的主要推动者。*  +

现在让我给你举一些这个时期, 政府实施的改革例子。我们先从公共卫生方面的改革说起。英国的埃德温·查德威克（Edwin Chadwick）为穷人寻求改革。据他估计，穷人一直贫穷的一个最重要因素, 是疾病。  +

在彻底研究了情况之后，他发现, 疾病在穷人中大量传播, 是因为他们肮脏且不卫生的生活环境。这成为了英国第一部"公共卫生立法"的基础，通过这部立法，英国建立了现代卫生系统，包括下水道和清洁水系统。  +

这些改革在民众中非常受欢迎。**英国议会继续颁布改革措施，因为这些改革很受欢迎，工人阶级开始更加信任他们的政府，并且减少了暴力阶级斗争的可能性。**此外，由于许多这些改革是英国自由党（Liberal Party）的政策，到1906年，自由党在议会中占据了多数席位。  +

其次，政府推动了"城市规划"方面的改革。拿破仑三世（Napoleon III）让乔治·奥斯曼（Georges Haussmann）负责拆除旧巴黎并重建。旧巴黎极度拥挤，尤其是在贫困地区，疾病肆虐。  +

在20年的时间里，奥斯曼几乎拆除了巴黎的每一座建筑。他大幅拓宽了林荫大道，这除了创造更多开放空间之外，也意味着革命者不能那么容易地建造街垒了。抱歉啦，伙计们。  +

总之，奥斯曼建造了两座大型公园——一座在城市的富人区，一座在穷人区。此外，城市安装了下水道和输水管道, 来帮助缓解疾病。由于他的巨大成功，新巴黎成为了整个欧洲城市规划新项目的典范。  +

第三，**政府发展了专业警察力量。**由于工业城市人口极度拥挤，仅仅依靠当地人雇佣的几个警察来维持秩序已经行不通了。所以在19世纪中期，政府开始培训和雇佣专业警察力量, 来维持治安。  +

与此相关的是，政府也开始改革监狱系统。在英国伊丽莎白·弗莱（Elizabeth Fry）等改革者工作的推动下，监狱开始按性别进行隔离，囚犯有了接受教育和就业的机会。  +

*这里要记住的重要一点是：这些改革是由政府领导的，尽管它们受到了公众舆论、杰出个人和慈善组织的启发。*  +

**在1870年至1914年间，大多数欧洲政府, 通过了"义务教育法"，让6到12岁的男孩和女孩都能上学。**如果你正在观看这个视频，你就是这些公平法律的受益者。你可能会想，他们为什么要这样做呢？  +

嗯，政府通过"义务教育法", 基本上有三个原因。首先，通过这些法律是为了维护公共秩序。还记得我们在之前视频中看到的关于儿童的情况吗——即**越来越多的法律规定，在一定年龄以下工作是违法的。**  +

*如果你有一群孩子到处乱跑，没有工作，除了惹麻烦什么都不做，那么你知道——把他们送进公立学校，秩序就恢复了。*  +

**政府通过这些法律的第二个原因是，他们认为学校是在年轻人中培养"民族主义"的主要环境。**对于大多数国家来说，"公共教育"被视为一种将一代孩子培养成国家"爱国者"的方式，让每个人都学习相同的语言和历史。  +

这产生了使人口更加融合的效果。  +

政府通过这些法律的第三个原因, 是为了经济增长。在第二次工业革命期间，*高薪工作变得更加技术化和专业化。因此，义务教育让学生更适合从事这类工作。*  +

这种改革的一个很好的例子, 是德国幼儿园（kindergarten）的发展。幼儿园是德国改革者弗里德里希·福禄贝尔（Friedrich Fröbel）的创想。他认为非常年幼的孩子应该主要通过玩耍来接受教育。  +

为此，他建立了幼儿园，为孩子们提供了用几何积木搭建, 和参与"基于游戏的活动"的机会。在德意志各邦，1848年的革命, 导致政府关闭了这些幼儿园，但那时这个理念已经传播到其他欧洲国家，并且在这些国家取得了一定的成功。  +
