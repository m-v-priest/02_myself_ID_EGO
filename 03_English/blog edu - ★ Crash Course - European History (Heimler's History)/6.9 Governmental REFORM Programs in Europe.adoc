== 释义

If you had lived in London in the early 19th century, it would have been what historians referred to as a state （某种糟糕的）状态或境况. There wasn't any indoor plumbing 室内管道系统, and so people did their business /and threw it out the window, and it washed away into the River Thames 泰晤士河. And *as it turns out* 事实证明, it's not a great solution for a whole city /to hurl (v.)投掷；扔 their grumpies (a.)脾气坏的；性情暴躁的(这里可能是一种不太正式的说法，可理解为“排泄物”等) into the main source 来源，出处 of drinking water. So what to do, what to do? +

[.my2]
若你生活在19世纪初的伦敦，那正是历史学家所称的"粪城时代"。当时的城市没有室内排水系统，人们如厕后直接将秽物抛出窗外，任其随雨水冲入泰晤士河。而事实证明——整座城市都将排泄物倾倒入饮用水源，这绝非明智之举。当局者该如何破局？

Well, Big Daddy 大老爹,大家长 government is going to get involved /and start *fixing* (v.) this problem and many other problems *quick, fast, and in a hurry*. So let's consider (v.) how governments began *to play a bigger role* in people's lives /during this period of European history. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now in the decades 数十年 and centuries 后定说明 preceding 在…之前 the Industrial Revolution, `主` those in power `谓` essentially wanted governments *to stay out of their business* 别插手他们的事. And this is a core idea of liberalism 自由主义 -- namely 即；也就是 that the government should operate (v.)  according to a laissez-faire (a.)自由放任的；放任主义的 policy. That's just _a French word_ that means "leave (v.) alone" or "let alone." +

But in the middle of the 19th century, with the significant problems of overcrowding (n.)过度拥挤 and crime created by urbanization 城市化, people began to demand (v.) liberal reforms of their government. In other words, people wanted the government *to get involved in* solving their problems -- to go *from* laissez-faire *to* interventionist 干涉主义的,干预主义的. +

You see, as capitalistic (a.)资本主义的 societies grew (v.) more complex, *#it was#* no longer practical (a.)切实可行的 nor desirable (a.)令人向往的，值得拥有的；可取的；性感的 for many citizens /*#that#* the government stay (v.) completely out of things. 对许多公民来说，政府完全置身事外已不再实际，也不可取。. Rather, the government *was now seen as* the chief mover 主要推动者 of social reform. +

Now let me give you some examples of the kinds of reform 后定说明 enacted (v.)颁布；制定法律 by governments during this period. And let's begin with _the reforms in public health_.  +
`主` Edwin Chadwick of Britain `谓` sought (v.) reform for the poor. In his estimation 估计；评价, `主` one of the most significant factors of _the poor 后定说明 remaining (v.) poor_ 持续处于贫困状态的穷人群体 `系` was disease. +

After *studying* the situation *thoroughly* (完全地，极度地；仔细地，认真地，彻底地) 持续处于贫困状态的穷人群体, he found that /diseases were transmitted (v.)传播 among the poor in such high numbers 数量如此之多 /because of their filthy (a.)十分肮脏的，污秽的；淫秽的 and unsanitary (a.)不卫生的 living environment. This became the basis of Britain's first _Public Health legislation_ (法规，法律;立法) 公共卫生法, by which /Britain built (v.) modern sanitary 公共卫生的，公共保健的；干净的，卫生的 systems, including sewers 下水道 and clean water systems. +

Those reforms were massively popular (a.) among the peeps (俚语,这里可理解为“民众”,为 ​​"the people"​​ 的随意缩写形式). The British Parliament 议会 continued enacting (v.)制定，通过（法律） reforms /because they were popular (a.), and the working class began to trust (v.) their government more /and decrease (v.)（使）减少，（使）降低 the possibility of violent class struggles 阶级斗争. Additionally, since many of these reforms were the policies  政策，方针 of Britain's Liberal Party 自由党, they grew to have a majority 多数 in the parliament by 1906. +

Second, government *pushed for* reform _in terms of_ 就……而言；从……角度来看 urban planning 城市规划. Napoleon III *charged* (v.)赋予…职责（或任务）；使…承担责任（或任务） Georges Haussmann *with* essentially 本质上；根本上；基本上 *tearing (v.) down* 拆除 the old Paris /and building it new.

[.my2]
其次，政府强力推动城市规划改革。拿破仑三世授命乔治·奥斯曼对巴黎进行彻底改造——推倒旧城，重建新城。当时的巴黎旧城区拥挤不堪，贫民区更是疫病肆虐。

Over the course of 在一段时间内，经过一段时间 20 years, Haussmann *plowed (v.)犁（田）；耕（地）；翻（土） down* 推倒 nearly every building in Paris. He widened (v.) boulevards 林荫大道 significantly, which ① _in addition to_ 加之,除了……之外 creating (v.) more open space /② *also meant that* the revolutionaries 革命分子 couldn't build (v.) their barricades 路障 so easily. Sorry, guys. +

[.my2]
在20年的时间里，豪斯曼几乎铲平了巴黎的每一栋建筑。他大大拓宽了林荫大道，这不仅创造了更多的开放空间，也意味着革命者无法轻易地建立路障。抱歉了,伙计们。

.boulevard
-> boulevard一词是丹麦语的bulvaerk经过法语演变来的，##bul即“树干”，vaerk即“work”，合起来是“树干筑成的工事”，也就是“壁垒”、“防御工事”，##因为过去的这些防御工事大都是用“树干”建造的。当这些工事不再使用时，##工事的顶部就用来作为人们散步的场所。##或者有的地方就把工事推倒，在原来的地方修建一条宽阔的大道。这种大道，法国人仍袭用了丹麦人的叫法，只是在拼法上略加改变，叫做boulevard.后来，这个词便##用来泛指宽阔的街道，通常两边有树。##

Anyway, Haussmann built (v.) two massive public parks -- one _on the rich side of town_ /and one _on the poor side of town_. Additionally, the city installed (v.) sewers 下水道，阴沟 and aqueducts 渡槽；高架渠;水道；沟渠 to help mitigate (v.)减轻；缓和 disease. And _as a result of_ his magnificent  宏伟的，壮丽的；令人印象深刻的，出色的 success, the new Paris became a model for _new ventures 冒险；尝试 in urban planning_ 城市规划 all throughout Europe. +

[.my2]
总之，奥斯曼建造了两个巨大的公园——一个在城镇富裕区的一边，一个在城镇贫困区的一边。此外，该市还安装了下水道和渡槽，以帮助减轻疾病。由于他的巨大成功，新巴黎成为了整个欧洲"城市规划"新冒险(新实践​) 的典范。

Third, governments developed (v.) professional police forces 专业警察部队. Because of _the terrific 极好的，了不起的；极大的，惊人的 overcrowding_ (a.) in industrial cities, it was no longer tenable (a.)（主张等）站得住脚的；可维持的 *to keep order* 维持秩序 with _just a few officers_ hired by local people. So in the mid-19th century, governments began (v.) training and hiring (v.)  professional police forces *to keep the peace* 维持治安. +

And *related to* 与……有关 this, governments began to reform (v.) their prison systems 监狱系统 as well. Motivated by _the work_ of reformers (n.) like Elizabeth Fry in Britain 受到英国伊丽莎白·弗莱等改革者的启发, prisons were now segregated (v.)隔离；分开 by gender 性别, and inmates （监狱或精神病院等处）同住者；同狱犯人；同病房者 were given opportunities for education and employment. +

====

And `主` the important point to remember here `系` is this: these reforms *were led* by governments, although they *were inspired* by public opinion 公众舆论, prominent 著名的；杰出的 individuals 个人；个体, and charity organizations 慈善组织. +

Now between 1870 and 1914, the majority of European governments passed (v.) _compulsory (a.)必须做的，义务的，强制的 education 义务教育 laws_ /*to get* boys and girls between the ages of 6 to 12 *into school*. If you're watching this video, you are an inheritor 继承者 of those fair 公正的;合理的；恰当的；适当的;相当好的；不错的 laws. And you may be wondering, why did they do that? +

Well, governments *passed (v.) compulsory education laws* for basically three reasons.  +
First, they passed (v.) these *to keep public order* 公共秩序. Remember (v.) what we've seen in previous videos regarding children -- namely that /#an increasing amount of laws# *were being passed* 后定说明 #that# *made it illegal* for them *to work (v.) below a certain age*. +
If you got _a bunch of_ children *running around* with no jobs and nothing to do *but* cause (v.) trouble, well then you know -- stick (v.) them in public school /and order is restored 秩序的恢复. +

The second reason governments passed these laws was because /they deemed 认为 schools to be a prime 主要的；首要的 environment to engender (v.)产生；引起（某种感觉或情况） nationalism 民族主义 in their young people. For most states, public education *was seen as a way* to shape (v.) a generation of children into patriots 爱国者 for their state, with everyone learning (v.) the same language and the same history. +

[.my1]
.title
====
.engender
[ VN] ( formal ) to make a feeling or situation exist 产生，引起（某种感觉或情况） +
•The issue *engendered controversy*. 这个问题引起了争论。
====

This had the effect of creating a more integrated (a.)各部分密切协调的；综合的；完整统一的;融合的；整合的 population. +

And the third reason governments passed these laws `系` was for economic growth 经济增长. In the midst of 在…期间 the Second Industrial Revolution, high-paying jobs were becoming more technical and more specialized 专业化的. Therefore, compulsory (a.)必须做的，义务的，强制的 education prepared (v.) students to be more suited (a.)合适的 for those kinds of jobs. +

So a good example of this kind of reform `系` was the development of kindergartens 幼儿园 in Germany. Now kindergarten was the brainchild 脑力劳动的产物,心血结晶；独创的观念 of German reformer Friedrich Fröbel. He believed that /very young children ought to be educated (v.)  primarily through play 主要是通过游戏. +

And *to that end*, he established (v.) kindergartens /that provided opportunity for children to build with geometric 几何的 blocks /and *engage in* 参与，从事 play-based activities 游戏为主的活动. Now the revolution of 1848 in the German states caused (v.) the government *to shut down* these kindergartens, but by then /the idea had spread to other European states /who implemented (v.)实施；执行 them with some success. +

1848年德国各州的革命, 导致政府关闭了这些幼儿园，但到那时，这个想法已经传播到其他欧洲国家，他们实施了这些幼儿园，取得了一些成功。

== 中文释义

如果你在19世纪初生活在伦敦，那情况就如历史学家所描述的那样。当时没有室内管道设施(如排污水道)，所以人们处理个人事务后, 就把排泄物扔出窗外，然后这些东西就被冲进了泰晤士河（River Thames）。事实证明，对于整个城市来说，把排泄物扔进主要饮用水源, 并不是一个好的解决办法。那么该怎么办呢？  +

嗯，政府这个大家长就要介入, 并迅速开始解决这个问题, 以及其他许多问题。所以让我们来看看在欧洲历史的这个时期，政府是如何开始在人们的生活中发挥更大作用的。如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

*在工业革命前的几个世纪里，掌权者基本上希望政府不要干涉他们的事务。这是"自由主义"（liberalism）的核心思想——即政府应实行"自由放任政策"*（laissez-faire policy）。“laissez-faire” 是一个法语单词，意思是 “不干涉” 或 “放任”。  +

但在**19世纪中期，随着城市化带来的人口过度拥挤和犯罪等重大问题，**人们开始要求政府进行自由主义改革。换句话说，*人们希望政府介入解决他们的问题——从自由放任, 转变为"干预主义"。*  +

你看，随着资本主义社会变得更加复杂，对于许多公民来说，政府完全不干预事务, 既不现实, 也不可取。*相反，政府现在被视为"社会改革"的主要推动者。*  +

现在让我给你举一些这个时期, 政府实施的改革例子。我们先从公共卫生方面的改革说起。英国的埃德温·查德威克（Edwin Chadwick）为穷人寻求改革。据他估计，穷人一直贫穷的一个最重要因素, 是疾病。  +

在彻底研究了情况之后，他发现, 疾病在穷人中大量传播, 是因为他们肮脏且不卫生的生活环境。这成为了英国第一部"公共卫生立法"的基础，通过这部立法，英国建立了现代卫生系统，包括下水道和清洁水系统。  +

这些改革在民众中非常受欢迎。**英国议会继续颁布改革措施，因为这些改革很受欢迎，工人阶级开始更加信任他们的政府，并且减少了暴力阶级斗争的可能性。**此外，由于许多这些改革是英国自由党（Liberal Party）的政策，到1906年，自由党在议会中占据了多数席位。  +

其次，政府推动了"城市规划"方面的改革。拿破仑三世（Napoleon III）让乔治·奥斯曼（Georges Haussmann）负责拆除旧巴黎并重建。旧巴黎极度拥挤，尤其是在贫困地区，疾病肆虐。  +

在20年的时间里，奥斯曼几乎拆除了巴黎的每一座建筑。他大幅拓宽了林荫大道，这除了创造更多开放空间之外，也意味着革命者不能那么容易地建造街垒了。抱歉啦，伙计们。  +

总之，奥斯曼建造了两座大型公园——一座在城市的富人区，一座在穷人区。此外，城市安装了下水道和输水管道, 来帮助缓解疾病。由于他的巨大成功，新巴黎成为了整个欧洲城市规划新项目的典范。  +

第三，**政府发展了专业警察力量。**由于工业城市人口极度拥挤，仅仅依靠当地人雇佣的几个警察来维持秩序已经行不通了。所以在19世纪中期，政府开始培训和雇佣专业警察力量, 来维持治安。  +

与此相关的是，政府也开始改革监狱系统。在英国伊丽莎白·弗莱（Elizabeth Fry）等改革者工作的推动下，监狱开始按性别进行隔离，囚犯有了接受教育和就业的机会。  +

*这里要记住的重要一点是：这些改革是由政府领导的，尽管它们受到了公众舆论、杰出个人和慈善组织的启发。*  +

**在1870年至1914年间，大多数欧洲政府, 通过了"义务教育法"，让6到12岁的男孩和女孩都能上学。**如果你正在观看这个视频，你就是这些公平法律的受益者。你可能会想，他们为什么要这样做呢？  +

嗯，政府通过"义务教育法", 基本上有三个原因。首先，通过这些法律是为了维护公共秩序。还记得我们在之前视频中看到的关于儿童的情况吗——即**越来越多的法律规定，在一定年龄以下工作是违法的。**  +

*如果你有一群孩子到处乱跑，没有工作，除了惹麻烦什么都不做，那么你知道——把他们送进公立学校，秩序就恢复了。*  +

**政府通过这些法律的第二个原因是，他们认为学校是在年轻人中培养"民族主义"的主要环境。**对于大多数国家来说，"公共教育"被视为一种将一代孩子培养成国家"爱国者"的方式，让每个人都学习相同的语言和历史。  +

这产生了使人口更加融合的效果。  +

政府通过这些法律的第三个原因, 是为了经济增长。在第二次工业革命期间，*高薪工作变得更加技术化和专业化。因此，义务教育让学生更适合从事这类工作。*  +

这种改革的一个很好的例子, 是德国幼儿园（kindergarten）的发展。幼儿园是德国改革者弗里德里希·福禄贝尔（Friedrich Fröbel）的创想。他认为非常年幼的孩子应该主要通过玩耍来接受教育。  +

为此，他建立了幼儿园，为孩子们提供了用几何积木搭建, 和参与"基于游戏的活动"的机会。在德意志各邦，1848年的革命, 导致政府关闭了这些幼儿园，但那时这个理念已经传播到其他欧洲国家，并且在这些国家取得了一定的成功。  +

If you had lived in London in the early 19th century, it would have been what historians referred to as a state. There wasn't any indoor plumbing, and so people did their business and threw it out the window, and it washed away into the River Thames. And as it turns out, it's not a great solution for a whole city to hurl its grumpies into the main source of drinking water. So what to do, what to do?

Well, Big Daddy government is going to get involved and start fixing this problem and many other problems quick, fast, and in a hurry. So let's consider how governments began to play a bigger role in people's lives during this period of European history. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

Now in the decades and centuries preceding the Industrial Revolution, those in power essentially wanted governments to stay out of their business. And this is a core idea of liberalism -- namely that the government should operate according to a laissez-faire policy. That's just a French word that means "leave alone" or "let alone."

But in the middle of the 19th century, with the significant problems of overcrowding and crime created by urbanization, people began to demand liberal reforms of their government. In other words, people wanted the government to get involved in solving their problems -- to go from laissez-faire to interventionist.

You see, as capitalistic societies grew more complex, it was no longer practical nor desirable for many citizens that the government stay completely out of things. Rather, the government was now seen as the chief mover of social reform.

Now let me give you some examples of the kinds of reform enacted by governments during this period. And let's begin with the reforms in public health. Edwin Chadwick of Britain sought reform for the poor. In his estimation, one of the most significant factors of the poor remaining poor was disease.

After studying the situation thoroughly, he found that diseases were transmitted among the poor in such high numbers because of their filthy and unsanitary living environment. This became the basis of Britain's first Public Health legislation, by which Britain built modern sanitary systems, including sewers and clean water systems.

Those reforms were massively popular among the peeps. The British Parliament continued enacting reforms because they were popular, and the working class began to trust their government more and decrease the possibility of violent class struggles. Additionally, since many of these reforms were the policies of Britain's Liberal Party, they grew to have a majority in the parliament by 1906.

Second, government pushed for reform in terms of urban planning. Napoleon III charged Georges Haussmann with essentially tearing down the old Paris and building it new. The old Paris was overcrowded in the extreme, and especially in the poor sections, disease ran rampant.

Over the course of 20 years, Haussmann plowed down nearly every building in Paris. He widened boulevards significantly, which in addition to creating more open space also meant that the revolutionaries couldn't build their barricades so easily. Sorry, guys.

Anyway, Haussmann built two massive public parks -- one on the rich side of town and one on the poor side of town. Additionally, the city installed sewers and aqueducts to help mitigate disease. And as a result of his magnificent success, the new Paris became a model for new ventures in urban planning all throughout Europe.

Third, governments developed professional police forces. Because of the terrific overcrowding in industrial cities, it was no longer tenable to keep order with just a few officers hired by local people. So in the mid-19th century, governments began training and hiring professional police forces to keep the peace.

And related to this, governments began to reform their prison systems as well. Motivated by the work of reformers like Elizabeth Fry in Britain, prisons were now segregated by gender, and inmates were given opportunities for education and employment.

And the important point to remember here is this: these reforms were led by governments, although they were inspired by public opinion, prominent individuals, and charity organizations.

Now between 1870 and 1914, the majority of European governments passed compulsory education laws to get boys and girls between the ages of 6 to 12 into school. If you're watching this video, you are an inheritor of those fair laws. And you may be wondering, why did they do that?

Well, governments passed compulsory education laws for basically three reasons. First, they passed these to keep public order. Remember what we've seen in previous videos regarding children -- namely that an increasing amount of laws were being passed that made it illegal for them to work below a certain age.

If you got a bunch of children running around with no jobs and nothing to do but cause trouble, well then you know -- stick them in public school and order's restored.

The second reason governments passed these laws was because they deemed schools to be a prime environment to engender nationalism in their young people. For most states, public education was seen as a way to shape a generation of children into patriots for their state, with everyone learning the same language and the same history.

This had the effect of creating a more integrated population.

And the third reason governments passed these laws was for economic growth. In the midst of the Second Industrial Revolution, high-paying jobs were becoming more technical and more specialized. Therefore, compulsory education prepared students to be more suited for those kinds of jobs.

So a good example of this kind of reform was the development of kindergartens in Germany. Now kindergarten was the brainchild of German reformer Friedrich Fröbel. He believed that very young children ought to be educated primarily through play.

And to that end, he established kindergartens that provided opportunity for children to build with geometric blocks and engage in play-based activities. Now the revolution of 1848 in the German states caused the government to shut down these kindergartens, but by then the idea had spread to other European states who implemented them with some success.
