== 释义


Oh my goodness, get ready *to crack* (v.)破裂；裂开；断裂 them _brain folds_ (皱褶；折痕) 脑褶，脑沟 *wide open* （口语化表达，准备好绞尽脑汁；深入思考） /because in this video I'm going to tell you everything you need to know about the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 for AP European History. And there is a lot. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.*crack* (v.) them _brain folds_ *wide open*
把你的大脑沟回（brain folds）彻底打开

​​"Brain folds"​​（大脑沟回）：指大脑皮层的褶皱（学名“​​脑回​​”），褶皱越多, 通常代表更高的认知能力。 +
​​"Crack... wide open"​​（彻底打开）：字面像“撬开核桃”一样夸张，暗示​​“强行让你的大脑吸收大量知识”​​。

类似表达​​
这种风格在英语教学/科普视频中很常见，比如： +
"Buckle up, we’*re diving deep* 深入探究!"（系好安全带，我们要深入了！） +
"This will *blow your mind* 震撼你的思维!"（这会震撼你的三观！） +
"Get ready *to have your brain melted*!"（准备好让你的大脑融化吧！） +

So as folks like Galileo 伽利略 and Kepler 开普勒 were using _new methods of thinking and observation_ 观察 to #revolutionize (v.)使发生革命性巨变，使彻底变革,彻底改变# humanity's conception 观念 of the natural world, Enlightenment thinkers 启蒙思想家 *started (v.) thinking* (v.), "You know, I wonder if we can *apply* (v.) those same methods of thinking *to* social and human institutions 社会和人类制度." And _spoiler (n.)剧情透漏 alert_ （习语，剧透警告）-- that's what they do.  +
So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked (v.) with a healthy dose of #rationalism 理性主义#, let's get to it. +

-> #spoil,糟蹋，破坏，-er,人。#

(n.) +
1.a part of _an aircraft's wing_ 翅膀，翼 that can be raised (v.) in order to interrupt (v.) the flow of air over it /and so slow (v.) the aircraft's speed（机翼的）扰流片，阻流板.   +
**襟翼：飞机机翼的一部分，可以抬高以阻断其上方的气流，从而降低飞机的速度**

image:/img/spoiler.png[,50%]


2._a raised part_ on a fast car  _that_ prevents (v.) it from being lifted (v.) off the road when travelling (v.) very fast （汽车的）气流偏导器 +
*高速汽车上的凸起部分，在高速行驶时防止汽车被抬离路面* +

image:/img/spoiler 2.jpg[,15%]

At higher speeds, aerodynamic lift can reduce the tyre grip on the road, leading to instability. Spoilers help minimise this by disrupting airflow and reducing turbulence, particularly over the rear of the vehicle. Rear wings, in contrast, generate downforce, pushing the car down to improve traction and cornering performance. +
*##在高速行驶时，空气动力升力, 会降低轮胎的抓地力，导致车辆不稳定。"扰流板"可以扰乱气流，减少湍流，尤其是在车辆后部，从而最大限度地减少空气动力升力。##相比之下，##后翼可以产生"下压力"，将车身向下推，##从而提高牵引力和转弯性能。*

Due to the popularity of aftermarket accessories, a car spoiler and a rear wing are used as interchangeable terminologies although both have specific functions and uses.  +
A car spoiler is an aerodynamic device designed to disrupt or "spoil" unfavourable air movement across a vehicle's body during motion. Typically mounted on the rear, spoilers manage airflow to reduce lift and, in some cases, reduce drag as well. This results in improved grip with stable handling, especially during high-speed driving.  +
由于售后配件的普及，*“汽车扰流板”和“尾翼”经常被混用，尽管它们各自都有特定的功能和用途。##汽车"扰流板"是一种空气动力学装置，旨在扰乱或“阻断”车辆行驶过程中车身的不利气流。扰流板通常安装在车辆后部，用于控制气流以减少升力，##在某些情况下还可以减少阻力。这可以提高抓地力并实现稳定的操控性，尤其是在高速行驶时。*

There are two major categories of car spoilers: +
汽车扰流板主要分为两大类：

- Boot lip spoiler: Usually fitted flush with the vehicle's boot lid, they redirect turbulent air and reduce drag to stabilize the car. +
*#行李箱唇形扰流板： 通常与车辆的行李箱盖齐平安装，可改变湍流空气的方向, 并减少阻力以稳定车辆。#*

image:/img/Boot lip spoiler.webp[,20%]



- Rear Wing: Raised wing-like structure that generates downforce by redirecting air flow upwards, thus effectively pressing the car downwards for better grip. +
*#后翼： 凸起的翼状结构，通过将气流向上重新定向, 来产生"下压力"，从而有效地将汽车向下压, 以获得更好的抓地力。#*

image:/img/Rear Wing.jpg[,20%]



The primary function of a rear wing is to improve traction by generating downforce. As your car speeds up, air moves faster over the curved upper surface of the rear wing than the flatter underside. This difference in air pressure creates a downward force, pressing the rear tyres harder onto the road. Think of it as an inverted wing of an airplane, where instead of lift (thus flight), a rear wing on a car does the opposite to prevent lift. +
尾翼的主要功能是: 通过产生"下压力", 来提升牵引力。随着汽车加速，气流在尾翼弯曲的上表面流动的速度, 会比在平坦的下表面流动的速度更快。这种气压差, 会产生向下的力，使后轮更用力地压在路面上。*#我们可以把它想象成飞机的倒置机翼，只不过汽车上的尾翼不是产生"升力"（从而飞行），而是起到相反的作用，以"抵消升力"。#*

3.( especially NAmE ) a candidate for a political office who is unlikely to win /but who may get enough votes to prevent (v.) one of the main candidates from winning 选举中的搅局者（无望获胜, 但所得选票可能使某主要候选人无法当选） +

4.a person or thing that intends (v.)打算 or is intended to stop sb/sth being successful 阻碍…成功的人（或事物）；搞砸…的人（或事物） +

5.information that you are given about what is going to happen in a film/movie, television series etc. before it is shown to the public （在电影、电视连续剧等公映前的）剧情透漏 +

6.a newspaper story, book, etc. that is produced very quickly /in order *to take attention away* from one 后定 produced (v.) by a competitor that appears (v.) at the same time （为竞争而迅速发表的）抵消影响的报道（或书籍等） +

.rationalism
( philosophy 哲) the belief that all behaviour, opinions, etc. should *be based on* reason /rather than *on* emotions or religious beliefs 理性主义；唯理论
====

So let's start with the definition of the Enlightenment. And hey, if you don't want to write it all down 把所有的东西都写下来, then I've got note guides 笔记指南 for this video and all my videos 后定 you can grab right here.  +
So the Enlightenment was a European intellectual 智力的，理智的 movement 思想运动 in the 18th century /that *applied* (v.) new methods of rational thinking 理性思考 *to* social and human institutions. +

In general, there were three main emphases 重点 of this movement that you need to know.  +
First, `主` the methods of science 后定 pioneered (v.)开创 by Kepler and Newton 牛顿 and Galileo and others `谓` could be used (v.) to improve society.  +
The name for this was #rationalism 理性主义；唯理主义#, and it meant that /everything in human life could and should *be #submitted (v.)顺从；屈服；投降；不得已接受# to* （习语，经受；接受） the process of reason 推理过程. +

Second, Enlightenment thinkers believed that /as the scientific method 科学方法 could be used (v.) to discover the laws of nature 自然规律, it could also be used (v.) to discover the laws of society 社会规律. +

And third, if _both of the first two_ were true, then Enlightenment thought 启蒙思想 could *lead to* progress in the human spirit 人类精神进步. So those are the big ideas 重要观点,思想  of the Enlightenment. +

So now let's **get down and dirty** (v.弄脏) 尽情享受，全身心投入 in the details （习语，深入细节）, and for that, let me introduce you to the major French philosophes 哲学家 -- and you know, that's just the French word for philosopher, don't get confused.  +
And `主` the reason 后定 _Enlightenment thought first *took root in* 扎根于 France_ `系` is because France was kind of _the biggest deal_ there was （习语，最重要的；最有影响力的）in the European continent during this time. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.the biggest deal
是一个口语化的幽默表达，意思是 ​​“最重要/最厉害/最牛的存在”​​，用来强调法国在当时欧洲的 ​​核心地位和影响力​​。 +

"Deal"​​ 通常指“交易”或“事情”，但在俚语中，​​*"a big deal"​​ = 非常重要的人/事物（类似中文的“大咖”“顶流”）。* +
​​*"The biggest deal"​​ 是最高级，相当于 ​​“最重量级的角色”*​​ 或 ​​“当时最牛的国家”​​。

作者解释 ​​“启蒙思想（Enlightenment）首先在法国扎根”​​ 的原因，是因为18世纪的法国确实是欧洲的 ​​文化、思想和政治中心​​（比如伏尔泰、卢梭等哲学家云集)

All right, the first thinker to know is the _Baron 男爵；大亨；巨头 de Montesquieu_ 孟德斯鸠男爵. And as a member of France's noble class 贵族阶级, he was not a big fan 头号迷丝,狂热爱好者 of 不喜欢 the growth of #absolutism 专制主义# under Louis XIV 路易十四. `主` To see the king *consolidating (v.) 巩固 all the power* under himself `系` was unacceptable to Montesquieu, and that #objection 反对的理由；反对；异议# #animated (v.)使具活力；使生气勃勃;激发;把…制作成动画片# the production of one of his greatest works, namely _The Spirit of the Laws_ 《论法的精神》. +

[.my2]
孟德斯鸠看到国王把所有的权力都集中在自己的手中，这种反对促使他写出了他最伟大的著作之一，即《法律的精神》。

[.my1]
.案例

.baron
(n.) +
1.a nobleman of the lowest rank. In Britain, barons use the title Lord ; in other countries they use the title Baron . *男爵（最低一级贵族。#英国男爵头衔为 Lord；其他国家为 Baron#）* +

2.a person who owns or controls a large part of a particular industry 工商业巨头 +
•a press baron报业大王 +
•drug barons毒枭 +

-> "男爵"是贵族爵位中最低的一级。盎格鲁一撒克逊时代英语中已有男爵（baron）一词，但无男爵爵位，而且词义不够确定。似有“自由者”或“国王的臣仆”之意，并无尊贵之意。 当时，所有那些直接从国王那儿得到封地的贵族, 都可称为男爵，但这并非由国王分封。*正因当时男爵在世俗贵族中占了很高比例，以至于“男爵”一词长期作为贵族的集合名词使用。*

11-14世纪，男爵的封号和封地, 可通过血缘和婚姻关系传递，但不得随意出售和转让，历代国王也不随意增加或褫夺贵族封号。 +
1387年，理查二世封约翰·比彻姆为基德敏斯特男爵后，男爵才成为英国贵族的正式爵位，并且始终是人数最多的爵位。

.de Montesquieu
image:/img/de Montesquieu.jpg[,30%]

（1689 年 1 月 18 日－1755 年 2 月 10 日）, 是一位法国法官 、 文学家 、 历史学家和政治哲学家 。

He is the principal source of the theory of separation of powers, which is implemented in many constitutions throughout the world. He is also known for doing more than any other author to secure the place of the word despotism in the political lexicon.[3] His anonymously published The Spirit of Law (1748), which was received well in both Great Britain and the American colonies, influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States in drafting the U.S. Constitution. +

**他是"权力分立"理论的主要创始人，该理论被世界各地的许多宪法所采纳。**他还因在巩固 “专制” 一词在政治词典中的地位方面做出的贡献, 远超其他任何作家而闻名。 [ 3 ] *他匿名出版的 《法的精神》* （1748 年）在英国和美洲殖民地都广受好评，并**影响了美国的开国元勋们起草美国宪法 。**

Montesquieu was highly *regarded* in the British colonies in North America *as* a champion of liberty. According to a survey of late eighteenth-century works by political scientist Donald Lutz, Montesquieu was the most frequently quoted (a.) authority on government and politics in colonial pre-revolutionary British America, cited (v.) *more* by the American founders *than* any source /*except for* the Bible.

Following the American Revolution, his work remained a powerful influence on many of the American founders, most notably James Madison of Virginia, the "Father of the Constitution".  +
Montesquieu's philosophy that "*#government should be set up /so that no man need be afraid of another 政府的建立应该使任何人都不必害怕另一个人#*" reminded (v.) Madison and others that /a free and stable foundation for their new national government required (v.) a clearly defined and _balanced (a.) separation of powers_ 平衡的权力分立.

孟德斯鸠在北美的英国殖民地被高度推崇为自由的捍卫者。根据政治学家唐纳德·卢茨**对十八世纪晚期著作的调查，孟德斯鸠是独立战争前英属美洲殖民地政府和政治领域, 被引用最频繁的权威，除《 圣经》 外，美国建国者引用他的著作的次数, 比任何其他资料都多。**   +
美国独立战争后，他的著作仍然对许多美国建国者产生着强大的影响，其中最著名的是弗吉尼亚州的詹姆斯·麦迪逊 ，他被称为“ 宪法之父”。*#孟德斯鸠的哲学是“政府应该建立在没有人需要害怕他人的基础上” ， 这提醒麦迪逊等人，新的国家政府的自由和稳定基础需要明确界定、平衡的权力分立。#*


Montesquieu *is credited 认为…属（某种类或性质） as* being among the progenitors 先觉者, who include Herodotus and Tacitus, of anthropology—as being among the first to extend comparative methods of classification to the political forms in human societies. Indeed, the French political anthropologist Georges Balandier considered Montesquieu to be "the initiator of a scientific enterprise that for a time performed the role of cultural and social anthropology".[19] According to social anthropologist D. F. Pocock, Montesquieu's The Spirit of Law was "the first consistent attempt to survey the varieties of human society, to classify and compare them and, within society, to study the inter-functioning of institutions."[20] "Émile Durkheim," notes David W. Carrithers, "even went so far as to suggest that it was precisely this realization of the interrelatedness of social phenomena that brought social science into being."[21]

孟德斯鸠被誉为人类学的先驱之一，与希罗多德和塔西佗齐名，*是第一批将"比较分类方法"扩展到人类社会政治形式的人。* +
社会人类学家 D·F·波科克认为，孟德斯鸠的 《法的精神》 是“首次持续不断地尝试考察人类社会的多样性，对其进行分类和比较，并在社会内部研究制度的相互作用”。 +
“埃米尔·涂尔干甚至认为，*正是这种对社会现象"相互关联性"的认识，才促成了"社会科学"的诞生。*

Montesquieu's most influential work divided French society into three classes (or trias politica, a term he coined): the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the commons.  +
[clarification needed] Montesquieu saw two types of governmental power existing: the sovereign and the administrative. #The administrative powers were the executive, the legislative 立法的, and the judicial 法庭的，司法的. These should *be separate (v.) from* and *dependent upon* each other /so that _the influence of any one power_ would not be able to exceed (v.)超过，超出 that of the other two, either singly or in combination 结合体；联合体.#  +
This was a radical idea because it does not follow the three Estates structure of the French Monarchy: the clergy, the aristocracy, and the people at large represented by the Estates-General, thereby erasing the last vestige of a feudalistic structure.

孟德斯鸠最具影响力的作品, 将法国社会划分为三个阶级（或称 trias politica ，这是他创造的一个术语）： 君主制 、 贵族制和平民制 。 [ 需要澄清 ] 孟德斯鸠认为存在两种政府权力： 主权者和行政者 。**#行政权力包括"行政" 、 "立法"和"司法"权力 。这些权力应该相互分离和依赖，以便任何一种权力的影响力都不能超过另外两种权力，无论是单独还是联合。#**这是一个激进的想法，因为**它不遵循法国君主制的三个等级结构： 僧侣 、贵族和由三级会议代表的广大人民，从而消除了封建结构的最后痕迹。**

The theory of the separation of powers largely derives from The Spirit of Law:

"权力分立"理论, 很大程度上源于 《法的精神》 ：

In every state there are three kinds of power: the legislative authority, the executive authority for things that stem from the law of nations, and the executive authority for those that stem from civil law.

*每个国家都有三种权力："立法权"、源于国际法的"行政权"、源于民法的行政权(即"司法权")。*

By virtue of the first, the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws, and amends or abrogates those that have been already enacted. By the second, he makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides against invasions. By the third, he punishes criminals, or determines the disputes that arise between individuals. The latter we shall call the judiciary power, and the other, simply, the executive power of the state.

- 凭借第一项权力(立法权)，君主或行政长官可以颁布临时或永久的法律，并修改或废除已颁布的法律。 +
- 凭借第二项权力(源于"国际法"的行政权)，君主或行政长官可以宣战或媾和，派遣或接收使节，建立公共安全，并防范入侵。
- 凭借第三项权力(源于"民法"的行政权)，君主或行政长官可以惩治罪犯，或解决个人之间发生的纠纷。我们将后者称为"司法权"，而将后者简称为国家的行政权。

Montesquieu argues that each power should only exercise its own functions; he is quite explicit here:

孟德斯鸠认为，每个权力都应该只行使自己的职能；他在这里说得很清楚：

When in the same person or in the same body of magistracy the legislative authority is combined with the executive authority, there is no freedom, because one can fear lest the same monarch or the same senate make tyrannical laws in order to carry them out tyrannically. Again there is no freedom if the authority to judge is not separated from the legislative and executive authorities. If it were combined with the legislative authority, power over the life and liberty of the citizens would be arbitrary, for the judge would be the legislator. If it were combined with the executive authority, the judge could have the strength of an oppressor. All would be lost if the same man or the same body of principals, or of nobles, or of the people, exercised these three powers: that of making laws, that of executing public resolutions, and that of judging crimes or disputes between individuals.

*当立法权与行政权合二为一时，自由便无从谈起，因为人们担心同一位君主或同一个元老院会制定暴虐的法律，并专制地执行这些法律。*

同样，**如果没有将审判权, 与立法和行政权力分开，就没有自由。**如果它与立法权结合在一起，对公民的生命和自由的权力将是专断的，*因为法官将是立法者。*

如果审判权与行政权合二为一，那么法官就拥有了压迫者的力量。

如果由同一个人或同一个首领、贵族或人民团体行使这三种权力：制定法律的权力、执行公共决议的权力, 以及审理个人犯罪或纠纷的权力，那么一切都将失去意义。


image:/img/svg 三权分立.svg[,100%]


If the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers, as Montesquieu indicated, there will be no separation or division of its powers, since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke.

**#如果由立法部门, 来任命行政和司法权力，#**正如孟德斯鸠所指出的那样，*#那么就不会有权力的分离(分立)或划分，因为任命权本身就带有撤销权。#*

The executive authority must be in the hands of a monarch, for this part of the government, which almost always requires immediate action, is better administrated by one than by several, whereas that which depends on the legislative authority is often better organized by several than by one person alone.

*#行政权力必须掌握在君主手中，因为政府的这一部分几乎总是需要立即采取行动，由一个人来管理比由几个人来管理更好(这是为了执行效率). 而依赖于立法权的部门, 通常由几个人来组织比由一个人单独组织更好 (这是为了谨慎和多思考公正)。#*

Montesquieu identifies three main forms of government, each supported by a social "principle": monarchies (free governments headed by a hereditary figure, e.g. king, queen, emperor), which rely on the principle of honor; republics (free governments headed by popularly elected leaders), which rely on the principle of virtue; and despotisms (unfree), headed by despots which rely on fear. The free governments are dependent on constitutional arrangements that establish checks and balances. Montesquieu devotes one chapter of The Spirit of Law to a discussion of how England's constitution sustained liberty (XI, 6), and another to the realities of English politics (XIX, 27). As for France, the intermediate powers (including the nobility) the nobility and the parlements had been weakened by Louis XIV, and welcomed the strengthening of parlementary power in 1715.

*孟德斯鸠认为，政府主要有三种形式，每种形式都由一项社会“原则”支撑：  +
君主制 （由##世袭统治者##领导的自由政府，例如国王、王后、皇帝），其核心是"荣誉"原则；  +
共和制 （由##民选领导人##领导的自由政府），其核心是"美德"原则； +
专制政体（不自由），其核心是##专制君主##，其核心是##"恐惧"原则##。*

**自由政府依赖于建立"制衡机制"的宪法安排。**孟德斯鸠在 《法的精神》 中用一章探讨了英国宪法如何维护自由（第十一章，第 6 节），并用另一章探讨了英国政治的现实（第十九章，第 27 节）。 +
至于法国，包括贵族在内的中间势力（包括贵族）和高等法院, 已被路易十四削弱，并于 1715 年迎来了高等法院权力的加强。

In this book, Montesquieu argued that /`主` *separating (v.) power into* multiple branches of government 政府权力分立 *so that* each branch *can #check (v.)控制；抑制；阻止# the other* 相互制衡 `系` was the only way *to avoid #tyranny (n.)暴政，专横；暴君统治#* and *encourage (v.)支持；鼓励；激励 equality* 平等. +

Voltaire *#cringed (v.)畏缩；怯退;感到尴尬不安；觉得难为情# hard at* （习语，对……感到厌恶）the religious intolerance 宗教不宽容 that he observed in France. And he spent some time in England and saw that because so many competing versions of religion were allowed, they could exist peacefully 和平共处.

Even so, Voltaire was kind of a big fan of absolutism because he believed that ordinary people weren't really capable of governing themselves 管理自己. But he argued that absolutism must be tempered by （习语，被……缓和）Enlightenment thought. +

And third, let me introduce you to Denis Diderot 德尼·狄德罗. He was responsible for cataloging 编纂 the new Enlightenment worldview 世界观 in a work called The Encyclopedia《百科全书》. Now, Diderot didn't write this whole volume 卷 but rather collaborated with 与……合作 many other Enlightenment thinkers to produce over 72,000 articles on every conceivable realm 领域 of human life, filtered through the grid of Enlightenment thought 以启蒙思想为框架筛选. +

It's hard to underestimate the influence of this volume on the spread of the Enlightenment. It sold like madness （习语，畅销）. People began reading it, and it had a significant impact on how they thought about the world. +

Now, in addition to publishing books, the ideas of the Enlightenment spread through a variety of institutions 机构. For example, in France, one of the most popular was the salon 沙龙, which were private meetings 私人聚会 held in opulent houses 豪华住宅 where the intelligentsia 知识分子 openly discussed and debated new ideas of the day 当时的新思想. +

And then for the less well-off 不富裕的人, coffee houses provided a place where folks could gather and buy coffee for a penny 一便士 and discuss the new ideas of the day while drinking enough caffeine to kill a small horse （夸张表达，大量咖啡因）. +

Okay, now one of the major institutions of focus for Enlightenment thinkers was government and politics 政府与政治, and for that, let me introduce you to two other thinkers who contributed their big brains to this endeavor 努力 -- John Locke 约翰·洛克 and Jean-Jacques Rousseau 让 - 雅克·卢梭. +

Now, there are definitely nuanced differences 细微差别 between these two thinkers, but for our purposes, you just need to know the two main concepts on which Locke and Rousseau agree. +

The first political idea these men put forward 提出 was the idea of natural rights 自然权利. And these were rights that people had naturally -- honestly, it's a pretty good name for it. The idea here is that just by virtue of （习语，由于；因为）being a human born into the world, everyone had certain rights to which they were entitled 有权享有. +

For example, Locke wrote in his Second Treatise on Civil Government《政府论（下篇）》that people were born with rights to life 生命权, liberty 自由权, and property 财产权. And those rights were granted by the Creator 造物主. That last phrase is crucial to understand. If those rights are given by the Creator, then that means they are not given by a monarch 君主 and thus cannot be taken away or infringed upon 侵犯 by a monarch. +

And in the environment of absolutism that had gripped Europe 席卷欧洲 during that time, that was some spicy sauce （习语，很有冲击力；很刺激）. +

The second political idea these men put forth 提出 was the idea of the social contract 社会契约论. Rousseau wrote a book called The Social Contract《社会契约论》in which he argued that at the bottom of things （习语，根本上）, the power to govern 统治权 was in the hands of the people 人民手中. In order to protect their natural rights, the people choose to give some of that power over to 交给 a government. +

And then the contract piece of it means that if the government becomes a tyrannical turd （俚语，专制的废物）, then the people have the right -- nay （古语，甚至）, the responsibility -- to abolish that government and establish a new one that upholds their rights 维护他们的权利. +

The idea here is that people can only be governed by their own consent 同意 and that the root of governance 统治的根源 does not reside in （习语，不存在于）the divine right of kings 君权神授. That's also getting even spicier （习语，更有冲击力；更刺激）. +

Now, when I say that Rousseau argued that the power to govern is in the hands of the people, it's not quite accurate. More accurately, all the men have the power to govern. Rousseau believed that men and women were patently 明显地 not equal. He taught that women were by nature to remain subservient 顺从的 and to stay home raising children and making their husbands sandwiches. +

However, in the late 18th century, women like Mary Wollstonecraft 玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特 objected powerfully to 强烈反对 this kind of gendered inequality 性别不平等. Her book A Vindication of the Rights of Women《女权辩护》argued that women by nature should have equal rights to men 与男性平等的权利 and, moreover 此外, that women should be entitled to 有权获得 the same education as men. +

Oh baby, let's keep that Enlightenment thinking train going （习语，继续启蒙思想的进程）and see how it applied to economics 经济学. And for this, I need to introduce you to Adam Smith 亚当·斯密 of the Scottish Enlightenment 苏格兰启蒙运动. +

In his book The Wealth of Nations《国富论》, Smith hacked 抨击 the mercantilist policies 重商主义政策 of European nations. And remember, mercantilism 重商主义 was a state-driven economic system 国家主导的经济体系. Smith argued instead that governments ought to get their filthy hands out of （习语，远离；不干预）the economy and instead let people make the economic decisions based on the laws of supply and demand 供求法则. +

He argued that decisions made in self-interest 自身利益 and not state interest 国家利益 would ultimately lead to a flourishing economy 繁荣的经济. And so Smith's work became the theoretical basis for concepts of the free market 自由市场 and free trade 自由贸易. +

Now, at the same time, French economic thinkers known as the physiocrats 重农学派 were arguing for similar economic principles 经济原则. For example, physiocrat and Robert -- Robert? Isn't it French? It's French, as it wrote Robert. I don't know. I can't imagine a French person saying Robert. We'll say Robert. +

And Robert Jacques Turgot 罗伯特·雅克·杜尔哥 advocated for 主张 laissez-faire economics 自由放任经济学 in France, which, when being translated, means "let alone" （法语，自由放任；不干涉）. He argued that the government should have a minimal role in economics 政府在经济中发挥最小作用 and instead let people decide what they wanted to buy and what kind of work they wanted to contribute to society 决定自己的消费和工作. +

Now, religious and metaphysical beliefs 宗教和形而上学信仰 were also challenged and changed by the Enlightenment. Voltaire popularized a belief called deism 自然神论. This is the idea that there was indeed a God but that God was uninvolved in human affairs 不干预人类事务. +

The God of deism was like a clockmaker 钟表匠 who put all the gears of the universe together 组装宇宙的齿轮 and then wound it up real tight 上紧发条 and then just let it tick away 让它自行运转 without any further interference 不再干预. Now, this of course was a serious challenge to Christianity 基督教, which emphasized the miraculous intervention of God in human history 上帝对人类历史的奇迹干预 -- not least in the centerpiece of the faith 信仰的核心, the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ 耶稣基督的身体复活. +

Another Scottish thinker named David Hume 大卫·休谟 developed the idea of skepticism 怀疑论. The idea here is that all human knowledge -- all our ideas -- are gained through our sense experience 感官经验. Like, we taste things, we touch things, we hear things, we see things, and then our brains cobble all that information together into knowledge about the world （习语，拼凑信息形成知识）. +

And if that's how we get knowledge, then our brains can only really reflect the world as it exists in material reality 物质现实. And that further means that since God or the creation of the universe cannot be mediated through our senses 无法通过感官感知, then they're not legitimate articles of knowledge 合法的知识. +

And finally, Diderot, through his Encyclopedia, popularized atheism 无神论, which is the belief that no God exists 上帝不存在. More to the point （习语，更确切地说）, an atheist 无神论者 is someone who knows about God and consciously rejects God's existence 有意识地拒绝上帝的存在. +

Now, with these very public attacks on religion 公开抨击宗教, religious belief more and more became a matter of private instead of public concern 私人而非公共事务. This way, religious revival movements 宗教复兴运动 emphasized personal piety 个人虔诚 and individual relationships to God 与上帝的个人关系. +

For example, the rise of German pietism 德国虔敬主义 in the 17th and 18th century, led by Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf 尼古拉斯·冯·青岑多夫伯爵, pietism taught that true religious experience was not just about belonging to a church 属于教会 but rather was bound up in （习语，与……紧密相连）the mystical 神秘的, personal religious experience 个人宗教体验. +

Now, in much of Germany, of course, Lutheranism 路德宗 was the accepted religion, but Zinzendorf reacted strongly against the rationalistic approach to Christ 对基督的理性主义态度 that they preached. +

And then, influenced by German pietism, an English Anglican preacher 英国圣公会传教士 named John Wesley 约翰·卫斯理 gave birth to （习语，创立；产生）the Methodist movement 卫理公会运动. After Wesley himself had a powerful personal experience with God, he set out preaching in the streets and in the fields 街头和田野布道 -- acts that were considered very improper by the Anglican establishment 英国圣公会认为不当的行为. +

But Wesley argued that true Christianity was a matter of the heart 内心的事, not any external fact 外在的事. Therefore, to truly know God, a person had to be seized by a great affection 被强烈的情感触动. +

== 中文释义

哦，天哪，准备好打开你的思维吧，因为在这个视频里，我要告诉你关于美国大学预修课程欧洲历史中启蒙运动你需要知道的一切。而且要讲的内容很多。  +

所以，*当像伽利略（Galileo）和开普勒（Kepler）这样的人正在用新的思维和观察方法, 彻底改变人类对自然世界的观念时，启蒙思想家们开始思考：“你知道吗，我在想我们是否能把同样的思维方法, 应用到社会和人类制度上。”* 剧透一下——他们确实这么做了。所以，如果你准备好用大量的理性主义来充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

那么，让我们从启蒙运动的定义开始。嘿，如果你不想把这些都记下来，我这里有这个视频以及我所有视频的笔记指南，你可以点击这里获取。*#启蒙运动是18世纪欧洲的一场知识运动，它将新的理性思维方法, 应用到社会和人类制度上。#*  +

总的来说，这场运动有三个主要的重点，你需要了解。首先，开普勒、牛顿（Newton）、伽利略等人开创的"科学方法", 可以用来改善社会。这被称为"理性主义"，它意味着人类生活中的一切, 都能够且应该接受理性的检验。  +

其次，*#启蒙思想家们相信，既然科学方法可以用来发现"自然规律"，那么它也可以用来发现"社会规律"。#*  +

第三，如果前两点是正确的，那么启蒙思想可以带来人类精神的进步。所以这些就是启蒙运动的重要思想。  +

那么现在让我们深入了解细节，为此，让我给你介绍几位主要的法国哲学家（philosophes）——你知道，“philosophes”是法语中“哲学家”的意思，别搞混了。**启蒙思想首先在法国扎根**的原因是，在那个时期，法国在欧洲大陆上举足轻重。  +

好的，第一个要知道的思想家是孟德斯鸠男爵（Baron de Montesquieu）。作为法国贵族阶级的一员，他非常不喜欢路易十四（Louis XIV）统治下"专制主义"的发展。在孟德斯鸠看来，国王将所有权力集中在自己手中，这种反对意见促使他创作了他最伟大的作品之一，即《论法的精神》（The Spirit of the Laws）。  +

在这本书中，*#孟德斯鸠认为，将权力分散到政府的多个部门，使各部门之间相互制衡，是"避免暴政"并"促进平等"的唯一途径。#*  +

我想介绍的第二位思想家, 是所有法国哲学家中的元老，也就是**伏尔泰**（Voltaire）。他绝对是最著名的哲学家，而且可能是他们作品的最典型代表。*他写了大约70本书，涵盖许多不同的体裁，但它们都有一个共同点——对法国社会和宗教制度的批判。*  +

**伏尔泰对他在法国观察到的"宗教不宽容"现象极为反感。**他在英国待了一段时间，看到因为允许许多不同的宗教版本存在，它们能够和平共处。在法国，天主教被强制施加于民众，伏尔泰认为这是一种压迫。  +

*即便如此，伏尔泰在某种程度上还是支持"专制主义"，因为他认为普通人并不真正有能力管理自己。但他主张"专制主义"必须受到"启蒙思想"的约束。*  +

第三，让我给你介绍德尼·狄德罗（Denis Diderot）。他负责在一部名为《百科全书》（The Encyclopedia）的作品中, 对新的"启蒙世界观"进行编目。狄德罗并没有独自完成整部作品，而是与许多其他启蒙思想家合作，撰写了超过72000篇关于人类生活各个可以想象领域的文章，这些文章都经过了启蒙思想的筛选。  +

很难低估这部作品对启蒙运动传播的影响。它非常畅销。人们开始阅读它，它对人们思考世界的方式产生了重大影响。  +

现在，*除了出版书籍，启蒙思想还通过各种机构传播。例如，在法国，最受欢迎的机构之一是沙龙（salon）(相当于现在的论坛)，这是在豪华住宅中举行的私人聚会，知识分子们在那里公开讨论和辩论当时的新思想。*  +

然后对于不那么富裕的人来说，咖啡馆为人们提供了一个聚集的地方，人们只需花一便士就能买到咖啡，一边喝着足以毒死一匹小马的咖啡，一边讨论当时的新思想。  +

好的，现在启蒙思想家们关注的主要机构之一, 是政府和政治，为此，让我给你介绍另外两位为这方面贡献了他们聪明才智的思想家——约翰·洛克（John Locke）和让 - 雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）。  +

当然，这两位思想家之间肯定有细微的差别，但就我们的目的而言，你只需要知道**洛克和卢梭都认同的两个主要概念。**  +

这些人提出的**第一个政治理念是##"自然权利"的概念。这些权利是人们天生就有的 (如, 天赋人权)##**——老实说，这个名字起得很恰当。这里的理念是，*仅仅因为一个人出生在这个世界上，每个人都拥有某些他们应得的权利。*  +

例如，洛克在他的《政府论（下篇）》（Second Treatise on Civil Government）中写道，**#人们生来就拥有生命、自由和财产的权利。而且这些权利是由"造物主"赋予的。#**最后这句话理解起来至关重要。*#如果这些权利是由"造物主"赋予的，那么这意味着它们不是由"君主"赋予的，因此君主不能剥夺或侵犯这些权利。#*  +

在当时笼罩欧洲的"专制主义"环境下，这可是相当激进的观点。  +

这些人提出的**第二个政治理念是##"社会契约"的概念。##**卢梭写了一本名为《社会契约论》（The Social Contract）的书，他在书中认为，*#归根结底，统治的权力掌握在人民手中。为了保护他们的自然权利，人民选择将部分权力交给政府。#*  +

然后**#契约的意义在于，如果政府变成了一个专制的机构，那么人民有权——不，是有责任——废除那个政府，并建立一个维护他们权利的新政府。#**  +

这里的理念是，**#人民只能在自己同意的情况下被统治#，而且统治的根源并不在于君权神授。**这同样是非常激进的观点。  +

现在，当我说卢梭认为"统治的权力掌握在人民手中"时，这并不完全准确。更准确地说，所有男性拥有统治的权力。卢梭认为男人和女人显然是不平等的。他主张女人天生就应该顺从，应该待在家里抚养孩子和给丈夫做三明治。  +

然而，在18世纪后期，像玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特（Mary Wollstonecraft）这样的女性, 强烈反对这种性别不平等。她的书《女权辩护》（A Vindication of the Rights of Women）认为，女人天生应该和男人拥有平等的权利，而且女人应该有权接受和男人一样的教育。  +

哦，宝贝，让我们继续启蒙思想的进程，看看它是如何应用于经济学的。为此，我需要给你介绍苏格兰启蒙运动时期的**亚当·斯密**（Adam Smith）。  +

**在他的《国富论》（The Wealth of Nations）一书中，斯密批判了欧洲国家的"重商主义"政策。**记住，*重商主义是一种由国家驱动的经济体系。斯密认为，政府应该把手从经济中拿开，而是让人们根据"市场供求规律", 自主做出经济决策。*  +

**他认为，基于"自身利益"而非"国家利益"做出的决策, 最终会带来经济的繁荣。**所以斯密的作品**成为了"自由市场"和"自由贸易"概念的理论基础。**  +

与此同时，被称为"重农学派"（physiocrats）的法国经济思想家们, 也主张类似的经济原则。例如，重农学派的罗伯特（Robert）——罗伯特？这是个法国名字吗？是法国名字，就写罗伯特吧。我不知道。我无法想象一个法国人说“罗伯特”的样子。就说罗伯特吧。  +

罗伯特·雅克·杜尔哥（Robert Jacques Turgot）在法国倡导自由放任的经济学，“laissez-faire”翻译过来就是“放手不管”的意思。他认为政府在经济中应该扮演最小的角色，而是让人们决定他们想买什么，以及他们想为社会贡献什么样的工作。  +

现在，*#宗教和形而上学的信仰, 也受到了启蒙运动的挑战和改变。伏尔泰普及了一种被称为"自然神论"（deism）的信仰。这个观点认为确实存在一个上帝，但上帝不参与人类事务。#*  +

*"自然神论"中的上帝就像一个钟表匠，他把宇宙的所有齿轮组合在一起，然后上紧发条，就让它自行运转，不再进行进一步的干涉。当然，这对基督教是一个严重的挑战，因为基督教强调上帝在人类历史中的奇迹干预——尤其是在基督教信仰的核心，即耶稣基督的肉身复活。*  +

另一位苏格兰思想家**大卫·休谟（David Hume）发展出了"#怀疑主义#"（skepticism）的思想。这里的观点是，#人类所有的知识——我们所有的观念——都是通过我们的感官经验获得的。#**比如，我们品尝东西、触摸东西、听到东西、看到东西，然后我们的大脑把所有这些信息拼凑成关于世界的知识。  +

*##如果我们是这样获取知识的，那么我们的大脑实际上只能反映物质现实中存在的世界。##这进一步意味着，#既然上帝或宇宙的创造, 无法通过我们的感官来验证，那么它们就不是合理的知识范畴。#*  +

最后，狄德罗通过他的《百科全书》普及了无神论（atheism），无神论是指认为上帝不存在的信仰。更确切地说，无神论者是"知道上帝,但有意识地拒绝承认上帝存在"的人。  +

现在，**随着这些对宗教的公开攻击，"宗教信仰"越来越成为"个人"而非"公共"关注的事情 (即, 不是集体信仰, 而是个人信仰)。**这样一来，宗教复兴运动强调个人的虔诚以及个人与上帝的关系。  +

例如，17和18世纪由尼古拉斯·冯·辛岑多夫伯爵（Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf）领导的德国"虔敬主义"（pietism）的兴起，*"虔敬主义"教导说，真正的宗教体验, 不仅仅是属于某个教会，而是与神秘的"个人宗教体验"紧密相连。*  +

在德国的大部分地区，当然，路德教（Lutheranism）是被接受的宗教，但辛岑多夫强烈反对他们所宣扬的对基督的理性主义态度。  +

然后，**受德国"虔敬主义"的影响，一位名叫约翰·卫斯理（John Wesley）的英国圣公会传教士, 开创了"卫理公会"运动（Methodist movement）。卫斯理自己经历了与上帝的强烈个人体验**后，开始在街头和田野布道——这些行为被"圣公会"的当权派认为是非常不恰当的。  +

但**卫斯理认为，真正的基督教是关乎内心的事情，而不是任何外在的事实。因此，要真正认识上帝，一个人必须被强烈的情感所触动。 ** +

Oh my goodness, get ready to crack them brain folds wide open because in this video I'm going to tell you everything you need to know about the Enlightenment for AP European History. And there is a lot.

So as folks like Galileo and Kepler were using new methods of thinking and observation to revolutionize humanity's conception of the natural world, Enlightenment thinkers started thinking, "You know, I wonder if we can apply those same methods of thinking to social and human institutions." And spoiler alert -- that's what they do. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a healthy dose of rationalism, let's get to it.

So let's start with the definition of the Enlightenment. And hey, if you don't want to write it all down, then I've got note guides for this video and all my videos you can grab right here. So the Enlightenment was a European intellectual movement in the 18th century that applied new methods of rational thinking to social and human institutions.

In general, there were three main emphases of this movement that you need to know. First, the methods of science pioneered by Kepler and Newton and Galileo and others could be used to improve society. The name for this was rationalism, and it meant that everything in human life could and should be submitted to the process of reason.

Second, Enlightenment thinkers believed that as the scientific method could be used to discover the laws of nature, it could also be used to discover the laws of society.

And third, if both of the first two were true, then Enlightenment thought could lead to progress in the human spirit. So those are the big ideas of the Enlightenment.

So now let's get down and dirty in the details, and for that, let me introduce you to the major French philosophes -- and you know, that's just the French word for philosopher, don't get confused. And the reason Enlightenment thought first took root in France is because France was kind of the biggest deal there was in the European continent during this time.

All right, the first thinker to know is the Baron de Montesquieu. And as a member of France's noble class, he was not a big fan of the growth of absolutism under Louis XIV. To see the king consolidating all the power under himself was to Montesquieu, and that objection animated the production of one of his greatest works, namely The Spirit of the Laws.

In this book, Montesquieu argued that separating power into multiple branches of government so that each branch can check the other was the only way to avoid tyranny and encourage equality.

The second thinker I want to introduce you to is the granddaddy of all French philosophes, namely Voltaire. He was definitely the most famous of the philosophes and probably the most representative of their work. He wrote something like 70 books in many different genres, but it all had one thing in common -- criticism of the social and religious institutions of France.

Voltaire cringed hard at the religious intolerance that he observed in France. And he spent some time in England and saw that because so many competing versions of religion were allowed, they could exist peacefully. In France, where Catholicism was forcibly imposed upon the population, Voltaire viewed it as oppression.

Even so, Voltaire was kind of a big fan of absolutism because he believed that ordinary people weren't really capable of governing themselves. But he argued that absolutism must be tempered by Enlightenment thought.

And third, let me introduce you to Denis Diderot. He was responsible for cataloging the new Enlightenment worldview in a work called The Encyclopedia. Now, Diderot didn't write this whole volume but rather collaborated with many other Enlightenment thinkers to produce over 72,000 articles on every conceivable realm of human life, filtered through the grid of Enlightenment thought.

It's hard to underestimate the influence of this volume on the spread of the Enlightenment. It sold like madness. People began reading it, and it had a significant impact on how they thought about the world.

Now, in addition to publishing books, the ideas of the Enlightenment spread through a variety of institutions. For example, in France, one of the most popular was the salon, which were private meetings held in opulent houses where the intelligentsia openly discussed and debated new ideas of the day.

And then for the less well-off, coffee houses provided a place where folks could gather and buy coffee for a penny and discuss the new ideas of the day while drinking enough caffeine to kill a small horse.

Okay, now one of the major institutions of focus for Enlightenment thinkers was government and politics, and for that, let me introduce you to two other thinkers who contributed their big brains to this endeavor -- John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

Now, there are definitely nuanced differences between these two thinkers, but for our purposes, you just need to know the two main concepts on which Locke and Rousseau agree.

The first political idea these men put forward was the idea of natural rights. And these were rights that people had naturally -- honestly, it's a pretty good name for it. The idea here is that just by virtue of being a human born into the world, everyone had certain rights to which they were entitled.

For example, Locke wrote in his Second Treatise on Civil Government that people were born with rights to life, liberty, and property. And those rights were granted by the Creator. That last phrase is crucial to understand. If those rights are given by the Creator, then that means they are not given by a monarch and thus cannot be taken away or infringed upon by a monarch.

And in the environment of absolutism that had gripped Europe during that time, that was some spicy sauce.

The second political idea these men put forth was the idea of the social contract. Rousseau wrote a book called The Social Contract in which he argued that at the bottom of things, the power to govern was in the hands of the people. In order to protect their natural rights, the people choose to give some of that power over to a government.

And then the contract piece of it means that if the government becomes a tyrannical turd, then the people have the right -- nay, the responsibility -- to abolish that government and establish a new one that upholds their rights.

The idea here is that people can only be governed by their own consent and that the root of governance does not reside in the divine right of kings. That's also getting even spicier.

Now, when I say that Rousseau argued that the power to govern is in the hands of the people, it's not quite accurate. More accurately, all the men have the power to govern. Rousseau believed that men and women were patently not equal. He taught that women were by nature to remain subservient and to stay home raising children and making their husbands sandwiches.

However, in the late 18th century, women like Mary Wollstonecraft objected powerfully to this kind of gendered inequality. Her book A Vindication of the Rights of Women argued that women by nature should have equal rights to men and, moreover, that women should be entitled to the same education as men.

Oh baby, let's keep that Enlightenment thinking train going and see how it applied to economics. And for this, I need to introduce you to Adam Smith of the Scottish Enlightenment.

In his book The Wealth of Nations, Smith hacked the mercantilist policies of European nations. And remember, mercantilism was a state-driven economic system. Smith argued instead that governments ought to get their filthy hands out of the economy and instead let people make the economic decisions based on the laws of supply and demand.

He argued that decisions made in self-interest and not state interest would ultimately lead to a flourishing economy. And so Smith's work became the theoretical basis for concepts of the free market and free trade.

Now, at the same time, French economic thinkers known as the physiocrats were arguing for similar economic principles. For example, physiocrat and Robert -- Robert? Isn't it French? It's French, as it wrote Robert. I don't know. I can't imagine a French person saying Robert. We'll say Robert.

And Robert Jacques Turgot advocated for laissez-faire economics in France, which, when being translated, means "let alone." He argued that the government should have a minimal role in economics and instead let people decide what they wanted to buy and what kind of work they wanted to contribute to society.

Now, religious and metaphysical beliefs were also challenged and changed by the Enlightenment. Voltaire popularized a belief called deism. This is the idea that there was indeed a God but that God was uninvolved in human affairs.

The God of deism was like a clockmaker who put all the gears of the universe together and then wound it up real tight and then just let it tick away without any further interference. Now, this of course was a serious challenge to Christianity, which emphasized the miraculous intervention of God in human history -- not least in the centerpiece of the faith, the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Another Scottish thinker named David Hume developed the idea of skepticism. The idea here is that all human knowledge -- all our ideas -- are gained through our sense experience. Like, we taste things, we touch things, we hear things, we see things, and then our brains cobble all that information together into knowledge about the world.

And if that's how we get knowledge, then our brains can only really reflect the world as it exists in material reality. And that further means that since God or the creation of the universe cannot be mediated through our senses, then they're not legitimate articles of knowledge.

And finally, Diderot, through his Encyclopedia, popularized atheism, which is the belief that no God exists. More to the point, an atheist is someone who knows about God and consciously rejects God's existence.

Now, with these very public attacks on religion, religious belief more and more became a matter of private instead of public concern. This way, religious revival movements emphasized personal piety and individual relationships to God.

For example, the rise of German pietism in the 17th and 18th century, led by Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf, pietism taught that true religious experience was not just about belonging to a church but rather was bound up in the mystical, personal religious experience.

Now, in much of Germany, of course, Lutheranism was the accepted religion, but Zinzendorf reacted strongly against the rationalistic approach to Christ that they preached.

And then, influenced by German pietism, an English Anglican preacher named John Wesley gave birth to the Methodist movement. After Wesley himself had a powerful personal experience with God, he set out preaching in the streets and in the fields -- acts that were considered very improper by the Anglican establishment.

But Wesley argued that true Christianity was a matter of the heart, not any external fact. Therefore, to truly know God, a person had to be seized by a great affection.
