== 释义

Oh hey and welcome to the first video on my series 系列片，系列节目 on AP European History 美国大学预修课程欧洲历史. And in this video we *begin in the beginning* 从头说起, and we talk about that _massive honking (（使汽车喇叭）鸣响,（鹅）叫) 巨大轰轰烈烈的的 cultural movement_ called _the Renaissance_ 文艺复兴（欧洲14至17世纪）. +

.honking
"honking"​​ 是一个​​非正式、夸张的形容词​​，用来强调某事物的​​规模、程度或显著性​​，类似于中文里的： +
*​​“巨大的”​​（强调体积或影响） +
​​“轰轰烈烈的”​​（强调声势或影响力） +
​​“不得了的”​​（口语化夸张）* +

- 原义​​：拟声词，形容​​汽车喇叭声​​（"honk"）。

- ​​引申义​​（俚语）： +
​​*形容词​​：修饰名词，表示 ​​“非常大的”​​ 或 ​​“引人注目的”​​，带幽默或夸张语气。* +
例：​​"a honking big pizza"​​ → 一张巨无霸披萨 +
例：​​"a honking mistake"​​ → 一个超级离谱的错误 +

- ​​副词​​：修饰形容词，相当于 ​​“非常”​​（类似 "damn" 或 "freaking"）。 +
例：​​"honking expensive"​​ → 贵得离谱 +

为什么这里用 "honking"？​​
作者用这个词是为了： +
​​突出文艺复兴的宏大​​：强调它不仅是“大规模”（massive），而且是​​震撼性、划时代​​的文化运动。 +
​​幽默效果​​：用拟声词（喇叭声）暗喻文艺复兴“响彻历史”。 +
​​口语化风格​​：符合视频讲解的轻松语气，避免过于学术化。 +

"honking" 在此是​​俚语化的强调词​​，无实际负面含义，仅增强语气。类似中文网络用语中的“巨无霸”“超炸裂”，适合非正式场合。在学术写作中应避免.

So if you're ready *to get* them _brain cows_ 大脑奶牛 *milked* (v.)挤奶（比喻“榨取知识”） with them, let's get to it. Oh, by the way, I am Steve Heimler, and if this is our first time meeting /then _mucho gusto_ 很高兴见到你. I'm here to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May, so you know, let's do that. +

.get them brain cows milked with them
这句 “get them brain cows milked with them” 是一种 幽默夸张的比喻 + 不规范语法 + 美国俚语风格 的表达方式，尤其模仿了美国南方或乡村地区说话方式。

*get ... milked：让……被挤奶（这里是隐喻）*。 +
brain cows：字面意思是“大脑的奶牛”，其实是比喻——把人的大脑比作奶牛（潜在的知识源泉）。 +
them（前面那个）：“them brain cows” 中的 them 是不规范用法，本应是 those，但这是一种故意用错来制造幽默。 +
with them（后面那个）：按语法看很混乱，其实是重复了前面的 “them”，为了押韵、节奏和幽默效果。 +

“get them brain cows milked” ≈ “开始用你的脑子努力思考、吸收知识。” 这是一个比喻句，把学习的过程比作挤奶，把你的“知识奶牛”（大脑）挤出“知识奶”（也就是获取知识的过程）。

“So if you’re ready to get them brain cows milked with them...”
“所以如果你准备好用你那‘知识奶牛’的脑子来开始挤知识的奶了……”
—— 就让我们开始吧！

.Mucho gusto
/ˈmu.tʃo ˈɡus.to/ ​​西班牙语. +
​​"Mucho"​​ = 很 +
​​"Gusto"​​ = 高兴 +
直译：​​“很高兴（认识你）。” +
====

All right, the Renaissance. *What in the fresh heck is it* 这到底是什么鬼东西? Well, by definition 从定义上讲, the word itself means (v.) rebirth 重生；复兴. So the Renaissance was a European movement that *grew out of* 发展自，源于 the rediscovery 重新发现 of the classical texts 经典文本 of ancient Greece and Rome. *It was* those texts *that* had died (v.) to Europe /and *were now being*, in a sense 在某种意义上, *reborn*. +

[.my1]
.title
====
.What in the fresh heck is it “这到底是个啥？”​​, ​​“这玩意儿是啥？”​​（带点吐槽语气）
What in the...?​​ → “这到底是……？”（表示疑惑或惊讶） +
fresh heck  → “新鲜的‘heck’”（"heck" 是 "hell" 的委婉替代词）

​​"fresh"​​ 是加强语气的形容词，类似 ​​“全新的”“离谱的”​​，让句子更有趣。 +
"heck"​​ 是 ​​"hell"​​ 的委婉说法（避免直接说脏话），类似中文的“见鬼”“啥玩意儿”。
====

Much of the teaching 教义，学说 of the classical age 古典时代 *had fallen out of* European memory 被欧洲人遗忘 by this point 到这个时候, partly because they lacked (v.) access to 无法获取 them /and partly because they were *busy dying* (v.)忙于死亡 by the millions /*thanks to* the Black Plague 黑死病.  +
Anyway, once the Renaissance *got underway* (a.在进行中的) 开始发生, it constituted 构成 a major change in the political, economic, and cultural fabric 结构;布料，织物 of Europe. +

[.my1]
.title
====
.busy dying
这里是​​黑色幽默​​，直白地说“人们忙着死”（因为黑死病肆虐），实际意思是：
​​“欧洲人当时没空管古典文化，因为黑死病导致数百万人死亡（社会崩溃）。
====

But it wasn't all change (n.) 并非全部的变化 during the Renaissance.
There was _an awful 让人讨厌的，糟糕的;非常的，很多的 lot of_ continuity (n.)连续性 with the Middle Ages 中世纪 that persisted (v.)持续存在, but *we'll talk about that more* in later videos.  +
Now, the Renaissance itself began (v.) in Italy, and since *that was* mostly a phenomenon 现象 后定 that occurred (v.) among _the elite 精英 of that society_, let's start by *talking about* the thinky-thinky (a.)<罕，非正式>趋于思考的；激发思考的 people. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.But it wasn’t all change (n.) during the Renaissance.
这里 "change"​​ 是 ​​名词​​（不可数名词），而非动词。 应为​​"wasn’t"​​（was not）是 ​​系动词​​（linking verb），其后必须接 ​​表语​​（名词或形容词）。 +
如果 "change" 是动词，正确结构应为：
"It didn’t all change (v.) ..."（动词原形需搭配助动词 "didn’t"）。
但原句用了 ​​"wasn’t"​​，因此 "change" 只能是 ​​名词​​。

"All" 在此修饰名词 "change"，强调 ​​“并非全部的变化”​​，类似结构如： +
"It wasn’t all fun."（不全是乐趣。） +
"It wasn’t all bad."（不全是坏事。） +

本句的  But it wasn’t all change (n.) during the Renaissance. 是与上文的 "a major change in the political, economic, and cultural fabric of Europe" 呼应，强调"文艺复兴时期, 并非所有事物都发生了变革。"

====

And *for that* 为此，因此, let me *introduce you to a guy* named Petrarch 彼特拉克. Now, technically 严格来说, Petrarch lived (v.) before 1450, which is the beginning of this course, but still, he'*s considered* by many *to be* the father of the Renaissance /because he *laid* 放；铺设；安排 the intellectual framework 知识框架 *for* it. +

[.my1]

.Petrarch
image:/img/Petrarch.webp[,15%]

Francis Petrarch, 1304- 1374年；活在文艺复兴之前至少50年. 意大利文艺复兴早期的诗人，也是最早的人文主义者之一。他还因第一个提出“黑暗时代”概念而闻名。
====


Specifically 具体来说, he developed a new philosophy called humanism 人文主义, which *focused on* the unlimited potential 无限潜力 of human beings *as an end* 作为目的 in themselves 本身就是目的.  +
He was also the first major figure 重要人物 to go *rooting around* 翻找、搜寻、仔细探索 in  classical texts, and when he found the writings of the ancient Roman orator 演说家 Cicero 西塞罗, he found a model for _the eloquence 雄辩 in Latin_ that would define (v.) the intellectual output 知识成果 of other Renaissance thinkers. +

[.my1]
.title
====
.root around
这个短语原指动物（如猪）用鼻子拱地翻找食物，引申为人类“翻箱倒柜”或“深入挖掘”的动作，常带有随意但专注的意味。 +
例：She *rooted around* in her bag for the keys.（她在包里翻找钥匙。）
====

This emphasis (n.)重要性，强调 would lead to a new discipline 学科 called philology 文献学；语言学, which was an inquiry 探查，探询 into 探究 the history and development of language, especially Latin.  +
And _the poster 海报 boy_  典型代表 for philological studies 语文学研究 was Lorenzo Valla 洛伦佐·瓦拉, who identified (v.)鉴定；辨认 several different stages 不同阶段 in the development of the Latin language. +



Now, that may not *seem (v.) like* a big deal 重要的事或人；（讽刺）没什么大不了的 to you, but because Valla could discern (v.)辨别 the differences /between Latin 后定 written (v.) in the 4th century /*versus* 与…相比 Latin 后定 written (v.) in the 12th century, for example, he was able *to demonstrate (v.)证明；证实；论证 that* `主` #various documents# 各种文献 that *were held as* authoritative (a.)权威的 for the Church -- precisely because of their antiquity (n.)古老性;古代（尤指古希腊和古罗马时期） -- `谓` #were actually written# (v.) closer to the present age, and thus their authority could *be questioned* 被质疑. +

You know, `主` questioning (v.) the authority of documents `系` was kind of a big deal, especially when you'*re dealing with* documents of the Church, which he was.  +
Anyway, eventually, Renaissance thinkers *self-consciously 自觉地 understood* (v.) themselves *as* humanists 人文主义者 *in the vein 静脉；（植物的）叶脉;风格；方式 of* 以…的风格 Petrarch 彼特拉克. +

For example, _Giovanni Pico della Mirandola_ 乔瓦尼·皮科·德拉·米兰多拉 wrote (v.) one of _the most widely read humanistic books_ called _Oration (n.)演说；致辞 on the Dignity of Man_ 《论人的尊严》, in which he *waxed (v.)给…打蜡;说话变得（热情、雄辩、伤感等）起来 eloquently (ad.)善辩地；富于表现力地;滔滔不绝地阐述 about* the unlimited potential 无限潜力 *bound 捆绑；系 up* 捆绑,紧紧束缚在……里;蕴含于 in the human being. +

• He waxed lyrical (a.)抒情的，热情奔放的 on the food at the new restaurant.他对这家新餐馆的菜肴, 越说越来劲。 +
====

Okay, so you're starting to taste (v.) the sauce 酱，调味汁 of the Renaissance. You might even say the Renaissance... oh, that's funny.  +
Anyway, we've got _a revival 复兴 of classical text_ and _the defining (n.)定义,给……下定义 philosophy of humanism_. +

Now, some Renaissance humanists continued *to believe in* God, but others championed (v.)拥护 secularism 世俗主义；现世主义, which *refers to* 指的是 the decoupling 去耦,分离 of religious belief 宗教信仰 from society, and individualism 个人主义, which emphasized (v.) the triumph of the individual 个人的胜利 *as opposed to* （表示对比）而，相对于;而不是 the community 群体. +

•This exercise develops(v.) suppleness (n.)柔软；易弯曲；顺从 *as opposed to (= rather than)* strength. 这项锻炼不是增强力量，而是增强柔韧性的。 +
====

Now, as I mentioned before, all these new ideas were largely confined to 局限于 _a handful of 少数 elite folks_ at the beginning.  +
But in the 1440s, with the invention of the _printing press_ 印刷机, the ideas spread (v.) widely and with great speed, *so much so that* 如此之甚以至于 these new ideas started (v.) challenging the institutional power 机构权力 of universities and other power centers 权力中心. +

[.my1]

.so much so (that)
to the extent that +
- The twins look (v.) alike — *so much so that* even their parents sometimes confuse (v.) them.
====


For example, education *underwent (v.)经历；遭遇（undergo 的过去式） a significant 显著的，相当数量的；重要的，意义重大的 change* during this period.  +
Since humanism was the flavor 情味，风味；香料；滋味 of the age 时代潮流, education became even more important.  +
Remember, humanism was the idea that _human beings had unlimited potential_, but if that potential was going to be reached, you *had to* get yourself educated. 但如果要实现这种潜力，你必须接受教育. +

And if you wanted to get yourself educated, then you needed *to submit (v.)使经受，使受到;顺从；屈服 yourself to* 使自己致力于 the new emphasis on liberal 思想开明的；自由主义的 studies 人文教育.  +
These subjects included rhetoric 修辞学;华而不实的言语；花言巧语, grammar 语法, logic 逻辑学, history, and moral philosophy 道德哲学.  +
The idea was that these disciplines 学科 would *shape* (v.) that _fleshy  (a.)肉的；肉质的；丰满的 ball_ 肉球  in your skull 颅骨，头骨 *into* a virtuous 道德高尚的，品行端正的 thinking machine 有道德的思考机器, and the emphasis on rhetoric *meant (v.) that* you could express (v.) those ideas eloquently 雄辩地. +

Now, this humanistic manner (n.) of thinking also *led to* changes /in how people understood (v.) their interactions 互动，交流 in the public sphere 公共领域.  +
This started among the Italian city-states 意大利城邦, `主` *which* you should know `系` *was* just _a handful of_ 一把；一小撮；少量的 regional kingdoms _at this point_ /and not the unified Italian state 统一的意大利国家 that we know today. +

Anyway, `主` the result of *applying* (v.) humanism *to* the public sphere `谓` *became known as* civic humanism 公民人文主义 (一种强调公民参与和政治责任的思想观念. 主张通过教育和道德修养提高公民素质，以实现公共利益和社会和谐。).  +
The idea here was that `主` #all the work# that a person did *to shape* (v.) their minds *into* a virtuous 道德高尚的，品行端正的 piece of meat `谓` #ought *to be applied to*# the political and economic realities 现实 of the state 后定 in which they live. +

*In this vein* 在这个方面，在这个思路上，按照这个方式;本着这种精神, you had Baldassare Castiglione 巴尔达萨雷·卡斯蒂廖内, whose book _The Courtier_ (朝臣；奉承者；谄媚者) 《廷臣论》 *served as* a guide for how an educated young man should behave (v.) in courtly society 宫廷社会 -- namely 即, to be a gentleman 绅士.  +
Castiglione *argued (v.) that* an educated man should be skilled (a.) in all the humanistic disciplines 训练，锻炼；（尤指大学的）科目，学科, write (v.) and speak (v.) with eloquence (n.)流利的口才，流畅的文笔；雄辩术，修辞, be physically strong 身体强壮, and most of all, mentally awake (a.)思维敏捷. +

Another example was Leonardo Bruni 莱昂纳多·布鲁尼, who wrote _The New Cicero_ 《新西塞罗》, in which he argued that `主` the intellectual man `系` was duty-bound (a.)义不容辞的,责无旁贷 *to 有责任 deploy (v.)运用 his education* in service of the state. +

And then there was our boy Niccolò Machiavelli 尼可罗·马基雅维利. And this guy is going *to show up 使显露; 显露 a lot* throughout  遍及，到处；自始至终，贯穿整个时期 this course, so let's spend (v.) a little time with him.  +
`主` #Machiavelli's preoccupation# (n.)使人全神贯注的事物，使人入神的事物；全神贯注，入神 with 关注 _the proper method_ 正确方法 of _wielding (v.)运用，行使，支配（权力等） political power_ 行使政治权力 `谓` *#was laid out#*  摆放,清晰地表达 in a little book called _The Prince_ 《君主论》. +

[.my1]

.Niccolò Machiavelli
image:/img/Niccolò Machiavelli.jpg[,15%]
====

Here, Machiavelli argued that /a ruler's main goal was to preserve (v.) power 维护权力 at all costs 不惜一切代价, and in that way, the ruler could ensure (v.) order and stability 秩序与稳定. +
And because Machiavelli believed that /human beings were essentially 本质上，根本上 self-interested turds (粪块；可鄙的人) 自私自利的人, the ruler had to wield (v.) power *in accordance with* 依照;与……一致；按照……的规定或要求 their nature. +

So if, to maintain (v.) power, the prince had to be brutal 残忍的, then *so be it* 那就这样吧(表示对某事无能为力，接受现实).  +
If the prince 王子，王孙；（小国的）国君，亲王；佼佼者，名家； （某些欧洲国家的）贵族, on the other hand, had to be kind, you know, so be it 就这样吧.  +
The point is: *maintain (v.) power* at all costs. +

And this was a huge departure 背离；离开，启程 from 与…大相径庭 older writings on _what it took to be a good ruler_, where the ruler's behavior was measured (v.) against 对照 _the virtues 美德 后定 established in the Bible_.  +
Machiavelli was like, "Oh, that's cute. But now, man, if a turd needs (v.) flushing 冲洗, you flush (v.) it."  +
You know, you wrote that in Latin? That was a... you know, rough translation 粗略翻译. +

And of course, the Renaissance marked (v.)赋予特征；给…确定性质 _a new expression 表达，表示 of artistic endeavors_ (n.v.尝试；努力) 艺术创作 as well.  +
And `主` the emphasis 重要性，重点强调 in art `谓` followed (v.) the same contours 轮廓,等高线 as everything else: classical revival 古典文艺复兴 and humanist inspiration 人文主义灵感. +

[.my2]
当然，文艺复兴也标志着一种新的艺术表现形式。艺术的重点和其他一切,都遵循同样的轮廓：古典复兴和人文主义灵感。

Now, artists in the Middle Ages -- before our _time period_ begins -- portrayed (v.)描绘 almost exclusively 仅仅，单独地，专门地；作为唯一的（消息）来源;几乎完全地 religious themes 宗教主题, *rich with* symbolism (象征，象征主义)充满象征意义.  +
And Renaissance artists *also* portrayed (v.)描绘，描述 _religious themes_ *but also* *branched (v.)长出树枝 out into* 扩展到 personal, political, and classical themes as well. +

A Renaissance artist also emphasized (v.) naturalism 自然主义, which was a style that portrayed (v.) the world *as it was* 如实描绘世界, not in ① _the mysteries_ of _symbolic (a.)用作象征的；有象征意义的 figures_ 象征性人物或形象 and ② _the flatness_ 平面感 that usually characterized (v.) art in the Middle Ages.  +
No, Renaissance artists pursued (v.)追求；获得；达到（目标） their realistic depiction (描述，描绘) 写实描绘 of nature *as their primary goal* 作为他们的首要目标, which is why _there's so many dang （非正式）该死的；十足的（等于damn） naked people_ in Renaissance art.  +
Because, you know, what's *more* natural *than* your _birthday suit_ (套装；西装；西服) 赤裸裸的状态,裸体? +

Anyway, *in addition to* 除了……之外 an emphasis on naturalism, there was also a new technique employed 采用, namely _geometric perspective_ 几何透视法.  +
And this was a way to portray (v.) realistic depth 真实深度 in a scene 场景.  +
For example, you see this in _Leonardo da Vinci_'s painting (n.) The Last Supper 《最后的晚餐》.
Notice (v.) how the lines in the room slope (v.)倾斜 /so that it creates (v.) the illusion of depth 深度错觉. +


Now, *in addition to* da Vinci, let me introduce you to a few important artists during this time.  +
You had Michelangelo 米开朗基罗, whose sculpture 雕塑 of _the biblical (a.)《圣经》中的，有关《圣经》的；宏大的，大规模的 David_ 《大卫》 gives you an example of a religious theme, but notice (v.) the humanist influence 人文主义影响.  +
The guy is sculpted (v.)雕刻 like a Greek god, which is to say 换句话说, in the image of perfected humanity 完美的人类形象. +

Also, you should know Raphael 拉斐尔, whose painting _The School of Athens_ 《雅典学院》 *puts* all of this *on display* （特性、情感或能力的）显示，表现，表露 as well 他的画作《雅典学派》也展示了这一切.  +
You've got classical themes 古典主题 -- *not least* 尤其，特别是 with Plato 柏拉图 and Aristotle 亚里士多德 here in the middle -- and notice (v.) the geometric perspective of the whole thing, which suggests (v.) balance and order 平衡与秩序. +

'''

== 中文释义

哦，嘿，欢迎来到我的AP欧洲历史系列的第一个视频。在这个视频中，我们从头开始，谈谈那个庞大的文化运动，即文艺复兴。 +

所以，如果你准备好让自己的大脑运转起来，那我们就开始吧。哦，顺便说一下，我是史蒂夫·海姆勒（Steve Heimler），如果这是我们第一次见面，很高兴认识你。我在这里是为了帮助你在课堂上取得A的成绩，并在五月份的考试中获得5分，所以，我们开始吧。 +

好的，**文艺复兴。**这到底是什么呢？嗯，**从定义上来说，这个词本身意味着重生。所以文艺复兴是一场欧洲运动，它源于对古希腊和古罗马经典文本的"重新发现"。这些文本在欧洲曾一度被遗忘，**从某种意义上说，现在它们重生了。 +

古典时代的很多学说在这时, 已经从欧洲人的记忆中消失了，部分原因是他们无法接触到这些学说，部分原因是由于黑死病，数百万人丧生，人们无暇顾及。不管怎样，*一旦文艺复兴开始，它构成了欧洲政治、经济和文化结构的重大变革。* +

**但在文艺复兴时期，并非一切都发生了变化。中世纪的很多东西依然延续了下来，**不过我们会在后面的视频中更多地谈论这个问题。现在，**文艺复兴本身始于意大利，**而且由于这主要是发生在那个社会的精英阶层中的现象，让我们从谈论那些善于思考的人开始。 +

为此，让我给你介绍一个叫**彼特拉克**（Petrarch）的人。从技术上讲，彼特拉克生活在1450年之前，而1450年是这门课程所涉及时期的开始，但尽管如此，*许多人仍认为他是"文艺复兴之父"，因为他为文艺复兴奠定了思想框架。* +

具体来说，**他发展出了一种新的哲学，叫做"人文主义"，它关注人类自身无限的潜力，并将其作为目的。他也是第一个深入研究经典文本的重要人物，**当他发现古罗马演说家西塞罗（Cicero）的作品时，他找到了一种拉丁语雄辩的典范，这种典范定义了其他文艺复兴思想家的知识成果。 +

这种强调导致了一门新学科的产生，叫做"语文学"，它是对语言，尤其是拉丁语的历史和发展的探究。语文学研究的典型代表是洛伦佐·瓦拉（Lorenzo Valla），他确定了拉丁语发展的几个不同阶段。 +

现在，这对你来说可能似乎没什么大不了的，但因为瓦拉能够辨别4世纪的拉丁语和12世纪的拉丁语之间的差异，例如，他能够证明，教会认为具有权威性的各种文件——恰恰是因为它们的古老——实际上是在更接近现代的时期撰写的，因此这些文件的权威性受到了质疑。 +

要知道，**质疑文件的"权威性"可是件大事，**尤其是当你处理的是教会的文件时，而他处理的正是教会文件。不管怎样，最终，文艺复兴时期的思想家, 自觉地将自己视为像彼特拉克那样的人文主义者。 +

例如，乔瓦尼·皮科·德拉·米兰多拉（Giovanni Pico della Mirandola）写了一本被广泛阅读的人文主义书籍，叫做《论人的尊严》（Oration on the Dignity of Man），在这本书中，*他雄辩地阐述了人类所蕴含的无限潜力。* +

好的，所以你开始领略到文艺复兴的魅力了。你甚至可以说文艺复兴……哦，这很有趣。不管怎样，我们有了经典文本的复兴,和"人文主义"这一决定性的哲学。 +

现在，一些文艺复兴时期的人文主义者仍然相信上帝，但另一些人则倡导世俗主义，*"世俗主义"指的是将宗教信仰与社会脱钩. 还有"个人主义"，个人主义强调个人的胜利，而不是社群的胜利。* +

正如我之前提到的，*起初，所有这些"新思想"在很大程度上只局限于少数精英阶层。但在1440年代，随着印刷术的发明，这些思想广泛且迅速地传播开来，以至于这些新思想开始挑战"大学和其他权力中心"的制度权力。* +

例如，**这个时期的教育, 经历了重大变革。**由于"人文主义"是那个时代的潮流，教育变得更加重要。记住，*"人文主义"认为, 人类有无限的潜力，但如果要实现这种潜力，你就得接受教育。* +

**如果你想接受教育，那么你需要接受对"博雅教育"的新的重视。这些学科包括修辞学、语法、逻辑、历史和道德哲学。**其理念是，这些学科会把你脑袋里的那个肉体大脑, 塑造成一个有道德的思考机器，而**对修辞学的重视, 意味着你能够雄辩地表达那些思想。** +

现在，**这种"人文主义"的思维方式, 也导致了人们对自己在公共领域如何进行互动的理解, 发生了变化。这首先发生在意大利的城邦中，**你应该知道，*那时的意大利城邦只是一些地区性的王国，而不是我们今天所知道的统一的意大利国家。* +

不管怎样，*将"人文主义"应用于公共领域的结果, 被称为"公民人文主义"。其理念是，一个人所做的"将自己的思想, 塑造为有道德的人"的所有努力，都应该应用于他们所生活的国家的政治和经济现实中 (就像中国儒家一样, 学以致用, 要入世)。* +

在这方面，有巴尔达萨雷·卡斯蒂廖内（Baldassare Castiglione），他的书《廷臣论》（The Courtier）为一个受过教育的年轻人在宫廷社会中应该如何表现提供了指导——也就是说，成为一名绅士。卡斯蒂廖内认为，一个受过教育的人, 应该精通所有的人文学科，能够雄辩地写作和演讲，身体强壮，最重要的是，精神清醒。 +

另一个例子是莱昂纳多·布鲁尼（Leonardo Bruni），他写了《新西塞罗》（The New Cicero），在书中他认为，有学识的人有责任运用自己的教育为国家服务。 +

然后是我们的尼可罗·马基雅维利（Niccolò Machiavelli）。这个人在这门课程中会经常出现，所以让我们花点时间来了解他。马基雅维利对"运用政治权力的恰当方法"的关注，在一本名为《君主论》（The Prince）的小书中得以阐述。 +

在这本书中，*马基雅维利认为，统治者的主要目标, 是不惜一切代价维护权力，通过这种方式，统治者可以确保秩序和稳定。而且因为##马基雅维利认为人类本质上是自私的混蛋，统治者必须根据人类的这种本性, 来运用权力 (很像中国的法家, 要利用人性的特点和弱点)。##* +

*所以，如果为了维护权力，君主必须残忍，那就残忍吧。另一方面，如果君主必须仁慈，那也行。关键是：不惜一切代价维护权力。* +

**这与早期关于"成为一个好统治者所需条件"的著作, 有很大不同，在早期著作中，统治者的行为是以《圣经》中确立的美德来衡量的。**马基雅维利就像在说：“哦，那很可爱。但现在，老兄，如果有混蛋需要被清理，那就清理掉。” 你知道，这是……你知道，这是一个不太准确的翻译。 +

当然，文艺复兴也标志着艺术努力的一种新表达。艺术方面的重点与其他方面一样：古典复兴,和人文主义灵感。 +

在我们所讨论的时期开始之前的**中世纪，艺术家们几乎只描绘宗教主题，充满了象征意义。文艺复兴时期的艺术家也描绘宗教主题，但也涉足个人、政治和古典主题。** +

**##文艺复兴时期的艺术家, 还强调"自然主义"，这是一种描绘世界本来面目的风格(即写实风格)，##而不是中世纪艺术中常见的象征人物的神秘性和平板性。**不，文艺复兴时期的艺术家追求对自然的现实描绘, 作为他们的主要目标，*##这就是为什么文艺复兴时期的艺术中有那么多裸体人物。##因为，你知道，#还有什么比赤身裸体更自然的呢？#* +

不管怎样，除了强调自然主义之外，还采用了一种新技术，即"几何透视法"。这是一种在场景中描绘现实深度的方法。例如，你可以在列奥纳多·达·芬奇（Leonardo da Vinci）的画作《最后的晚餐》（*The Last Supper*）中看到这一点。注意房间里的线条是如何倾斜的，从而营造出深度的错觉。 +

现在，除了达·芬奇之外，让我给你介绍这个时期的一些重要艺术家。有**米开朗基罗（Michelangelo），他的圣经人物"大卫"（David）的雕塑, 就是一个宗教主题的例子，但要注意"人文主义"的影响。这个人被雕刻得像一个希腊神，也就是说，是完美人性的形象。** +

你还应该知道拉斐尔（Raphael），他的画作《雅典学院》（*The School of Athens*）也展示了这一切。**画中有古典主题——尤其是中间的柏拉图（Plato）和亚里士多德（Aristotle）——并注意整个画面的几何透视法，**它暗示着平衡和秩序。 +

**在建筑领域，**有菲利波·布鲁内莱斯基（Filippo Brunelleschi），他是佛罗伦萨"圣洛伦佐教堂"（Church of San Lorenzo）重建的首席建筑师。*注意他摒弃了中世纪大教堂的"哥特式"传统，而是用罗马柱和拱门来设计教堂。* +

现在，*这些艺术家大多受到富人或有权势的人的资助，其中最重要的资助者可能是美第奇家族*（Medici family）。但我们会在后面的视频中再谈他们。 +

Oh hey and welcome to the first video on my series on AP European History. And in this video we begin in the beginning, and we talk about that massive honking cultural movement called the Renaissance.

So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with them, let's get to it. Oh, by the way, I am Steve Heimler, and if this is our first time meeting then mucho gusta. I'm here to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May, so you know, let's do that.

All right, the Renaissance. What in the fresh heck is it? Well, by definition, the word itself means rebirth. So the Renaissance was a European movement that grew out of the rediscovery of the classical texts of ancient Greece and Rome. It was those texts that had died to Europe and were now being, in a sense, reborn.

Much of the teaching of the classical age had fallen out of European memory by this point, partly because they lacked access to them and partly because they were busy dying by the millions thanks to the Black Plague. Anyway, once the Renaissance got underway, it constituted a major change in the political, economic, and cultural fabric of Europe.

But it wasn't all change during the Renaissance. There was an awful lot of continuity with the Middle Ages that persisted, but we'll talk about that more in later videos. Now, the Renaissance itself began in Italy, and since that was mostly a phenomenon that occurred among the elite of that society, let's start by talking about the thinky-thinky people.

And for that, let me introduce you to a guy named Petrarch. Now, technically, Petrarch lived before 1450, which is the beginning of this course, but still, he's considered by many to be the father of the Renaissance because he laid the intellectual framework for it.

Specifically, he developed a new philosophy called humanism, which focused on the unlimited potential of human beings as an end in themselves. He was also the first major figure to go rooting around in classical texts, and when he found the writings of the ancient Roman orator Cicero, he found a model for the eloquence in Latin that would define the intellectual output of other Renaissance thinkers.

This emphasis would lead to a new discipline called philology, which was an inquiry into the history and development of language, especially Latin. And the poster boy for philological studies was Lorenzo Valla, who identified several different stages in the development of the Latin language.

Now, that may not seem like a big deal to you, but because Valla could discern the differences between Latin written in the 4th century versus Latin written in the 12th century, for example, he was able to demonstrate that various documents that were held as authoritative for the Church -- precisely because of their antiquity -- were actually written closer to the present age, and thus their authority could be questioned.

You know, questioning the authority of documents was kind of a big deal, especially when you're dealing with documents of the Church, which he was. Anyway, eventually, Renaissance thinkers self-consciously understood themselves as humanists in the vein of Petrarch.

For example, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote one of the most widely read humanistic books called Oration on the Dignity of Man, in which he waxed eloquently about the unlimited potential bound up in the human being.

Okay, so you're starting to taste the sauce of the Renaissance. You might even say the Renaissance... oh, that's funny. Anyway, we've got a revival of classical text and the defining philosophy of humanism.

Now, some Renaissance humanists continued to believe in God, but others championed secularism, which refers to the decoupling of religious belief from society, and individualism, which emphasized the triumph of the individual as opposed to the community.

Now, as I mentioned before, all these new ideas were largely confined to a handful of elite folks at the beginning. But in the 1440s, with the invention of the printing press, the ideas spread widely and with great speed, so much so that these new ideas started challenging the institutional power of universities and other power centers.

For example, education underwent a significant change during this period. Since humanism was the flavor of the age, education became even more important. Remember, humanism was the idea that human beings had unlimited potential, but if that potential was going to be reached, you had to get yourself educated.

And if you wanted to get yourself educated, then you needed to submit yourself to the new emphasis on liberal studies. These subjects included rhetoric, grammar, logic, history, and moral philosophy. The idea was that these disciplines would shape that fleshy ball in your skull into a virtuous thinking machine, and the emphasis on rhetoric meant that you could express those ideas eloquently.

Now, this humanistic manner of thinking also led to changes in how people understood their interactions in the public sphere. This started among the Italian city-states, which you should know was just a handful of regional kingdoms at this point and not the unified Italian state that we know today.

Anyway, the result of applying humanism to the public sphere became known as civic humanism. The idea here was that all the work that a person did to shape their minds into a virtuous piece of meat ought to be applied to the political and economic realities of the state in which they live.

In this vein, you had Baldassare Castiglione, whose book The Courtier served as a guide for how an educated young man should behave in courtly society -- namely, to be a gentleman. Castiglione argued that an educated man should be skilled in all the humanistic disciplines, write and speak with eloquence, be physically strong, and most of all, mentally awake.

Another example was Leonardo Bruni, who wrote The New Cicero, in which he argued that the intellectual man was duty-bound to deploy his education in service of the state.

And then there was our boy Niccolò Machiavelli. And this guy is going to show up a lot throughout this course, so let's spend a little time with him. Machiavelli's preoccupation with the proper method of wielding political power was laid out in a little book called The Prince.

Here, Machiavelli argued that a ruler's main goal was to preserve power at all costs, and in that way, the ruler could ensure order and stability. And because Machiavelli believed that human beings were essentially self-interested turds, the ruler had to wield power in accordance with their nature.

So if, to maintain power, the prince had to be brutal, then so be it. If the prince, on the other hand, had to be kind, you know, so be it. The point is: maintain power at all costs.

And this was a huge departure from older writings on what it took to be a good ruler, where the ruler's behavior was measured against the virtues established in the Bible. Machiavelli was like, "Oh, that's cute. But now, man, if a turd needs flushing, you flush it." You know, you wrote that in Latin? That was a... you know, rough translation.

And of course, the Renaissance marked a new expression of artistic endeavors as well. And the emphasis in art followed the same contours as everything else: classical revival and humanist inspiration.

Now, artists in the Middle Ages -- before our time period begins -- portrayed almost exclusively religious themes, rich with symbolism. And Renaissance artists also portrayed religious themes but also branched out into personal, political, and classical themes as well.

A Renaissance artist also emphasized naturalism, which was a style that portrayed the world as it was, not in the mysteries of symbolic figures and the flatness that usually characterized art in the Middle Ages. No, Renaissance artists pursued their realistic depiction of nature as their primary goal, which is why there's so many dang naked people in Renaissance art. Because, you know, what's more natural than your birthday suit?

Anyway, in addition to an emphasis on naturalism, there was also a new technique employed, namely geometric perspective. And this was a way to portray realistic depth in a scene. For example, you see this in Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper. Notice how the lines in the room slope so that it creates the illusion of depth.

Now, in addition to da Vinci, let me introduce you to a few important artists during this time. You had Michelangelo, whose sculpture of the biblical David gives you an example of a religious theme, but notice the humanist influence. The guy is sculpted like a Greek god, which is to say, in the image of perfected humanity.

Also, you should know Raphael, whose painting The School of Athens puts all of this on display as well. You've got classical themes -- not least with Plato and Aristotle here in the middle -- and notice the geometric perspective of the whole thing, which suggests balance and order.

In the world of architecture, you had Filippo Brunelleschi, who was the chief architect on the rebuilding of the Church of San Lorenzo in Florence. Notice how he tossed out the Gothic conventions of medieval cathedrals and designed it instead with Roman columns and arches.

Now, most of these artists were patronized by wealthy individuals or those in power, and probably the most significant of these patrons was the Medici family. But we're gonna save them for a later video.
