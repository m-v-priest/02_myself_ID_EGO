All right, so World War II is over, and oh man, is it going to be nice just to chill 放松；休息 for a while, not have to deal with all the tensions 紧张局势 that caused the war in the first place? Ah crap, here comes the Cold War. Yes, right on the heels of 紧接着；紧随其后 the close of World War II, another global conflict started brewing 酝酿, and in this video I'm going to tell you all about it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked containment 遏制；牵制 style, then let's get to it. +

Now as you can imagine, after the cataclysmic 大灾难的；灾难性的 proportions of death and destruction that occurred in World War II, everyone wanted to return to normalcy 正常状态. But even before the war ended, a new tension was brewing between the United States and the Soviet Union. Now near the end of the war, the Big Three 三巨头 -- which included Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States -- met in a series of three conferences. And in these conferences, among other things, they negotiated 谈判；协商 what a post-war Europe would look like after their victory. One of the key agreements was that Eastern European nations would be allowed to choose their leaders and governments through democratic elections. That of course was great for the United States and Britain, but over in the Soviet Union, Stalin was like, "But regardless," they made the agreement and went ahead and finished fighting the war. +

And by the way, if you want Unit 9 summarized in a single video along with practice questions and everything you need to get a five on your exam in May, then check out my AP review pack, which is linked in the description. +

Now another one of the major agreements they made was that the League of Nations 国际联盟 was kind of a turd. Now remember that after World War I was over, the victorious powers 战胜国 established the League as an international body 国际机构 that would provide a place for heads of nations to work their problems out through diplomacy 外交手段 instead of war. But just by the fact that there was a World War II -- which was even more destructive than World War I -- should tell you that the League of Nations couldn't really do what it was intended to do. So the Big Three agreed that another international body ought to be created, this time called the United Nations 联合国, which would hopefully be able to do what the League of Nations could not -- namely, avoid another international war. +

But despite the establishment of the United Nations after the war, it could not keep the Cold War from happening. You see, after the war was over, Stalin decided that those Eastern European nations were not really ready for self-determination 自决权. Instead, the Soviet Union absorbed 吞并；吸收 those nations into what became known as the Soviet bloc 苏联集团. These satellite nations 卫星国 became communist, and their economies were made to serve the Soviet Union instead of themselves. But remember, the agreement between the Big Three was that these nations would hold democratic elections. But from Stalin's point of view, these states could act as kind of a buffer zone 缓冲区 between Europe and the Soviet Union. And so as a result of that move, the suspicion 怀疑 and mutual distrust 相互不信任 began. +

And then to add further distrust between the US and the Soviet Union, the handling of post-war Germany further divided the two superpowers. After the war, Germany was divided into four occupation zones 占领区 -- the Soviets, the French, the British, and the US each claiming one quadrant 四分之一；区域. Now this occupation was meant to be temporary 暂时的, but East Germany, dominated by the Soviets, quickly became another communist state. The Soviets wanted to keep Germany weak so that they would be less of a threat. And you know, you could hardly blame Stalin on this count -- like, so far in two world wars, Germany had caused untold destruction and death in Russia. But if you remember from the last video, the US wanted a strong Germany because that would lead to a stable Europe. But Stalin would have none of this, and so instead he tightened his grip on 加强对……的控制 East Germany, and thus more tension. +

So by this point, it was clear that there was a significant ideological 意识形态的 and political tension in Europe -- so much so that former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that an iron curtain 铁幕 had descended across the continent. In other words, the division between democratic Europe and communist Europe was complete. +

Now we're going to talk about how the Cold War was waged 发动；开展 in a moment, but in order to understand why the Cold War took the shape that it did, you have to understand the United States' policy of containment. Now because Stalin appeared to want the whole world made over in the image of Soviet communism, American President Harry Truman articulated 明确表达 what became known as the Truman Doctrine 杜鲁门主义, of which containment of communism was a significant driving force 驱动力. Basically, the Truman Doctrine said that any country who felt itself under the threat of communism could expect financial and military assistance from the United States. +

Now the first test for the Truman Doctrine became a civil war 内战 in Greece. And the two factions 派别；派系 fighting for control in Greece were -- would you know it -- communist and anti-communist forces. So Britain began supporting the anti-communists while the Soviet Union supported the communist cause. However, Britain ended up having to step out and deal with their own problems for a while, and so under the aegis of 在……的支持下；在……的庇护下 the Truman Doctrine, the United States stepped in to provide financial aid 经济援助 to the anti-communist forces so that Greece would not fall to communism. Now as it turned out, the anti-communist forces won, and that victory only further increased the division manifest 明显的；显而易见的 in the Cold War tension. +

Okay, so the Cold War by definition was not an armed battle 武装冲突 between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rather, it was called a cold war because the two nations stood in direct tension with one another and could go to war at any moment, but ultimately they did not. However, that doesn't mean that war was not waged, and here we need to look at how these two powers waged their decades-long standoff 对峙. +

First, the Cold War was waged through propaganda campaigns 宣传运动 on the European continent. Radio Free Europe 自由欧洲电台 broadcast signals into Soviet territories extolling 颂扬；赞美 the virtues of freedom and democracy. And so in order to combat 对抗；抵抗 this, Soviet propaganda emphasized the capitalistic greed 资本主义贪婪 of the West, not to mention 更不用说 the profound racial tension 种族紧张局势 in the United States. Like, how good could democracy be if those realities still exist? +

Second, the Cold War was waged through covert actions 秘密行动. And here we're talking about those juicy made-for-television realities of spying 间谍活动 and espionage 间谍行为. The United States created the Central Intelligence Agency (or CIA) 中央情报局 to handle all of its clandestine operations 秘密行动. The United Kingdom had their Secret Intelligence Service 秘密情报局, and the Soviet Union had the KGB 克格勃. And all these agencies were responsible for sending spies into enemy territory to gather information on the buildup of weapons 武器储备 and to discover what their next steps in the Cold War should be. +

And third, the Cold War was waged in the form of an arms race 军备竞赛, which is to say the buildup of especially nuclear weapons 核武器. Now remember, the United States had developed and deployed 部署 the world's first nuclear bombs at the end of World War II, which devastated 摧毁；毁坏 Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. And as it turns out, Stalin got his authoritarian 独裁的；专制的 feelings hurt when the US used these bombs and never told him that they had such a technology. Again, as I said before, the distrust started before the end of the war. So what's the Soviet Union going to do when the only other superpower in the world has developed this city-destroying explosive technology? Do they realize the horrible implications of nuclear proliferation 核扩散 and refuse to play that game? Don't be crazy. Now Stalin got to work developing the same technology. To that end, the Soviets successfully tested their first atomic bomb 原子弹 in 1949. Not to be outdone 不甘落后, Truman ordered the development of the hydrogen bomb 氢弹, which had something like a thousand times more destructive capacity 破坏力 than an atomic bomb. To which Stalin said, "You know guys, I think this has gone too far, and I don't want to live in a world where hydrogen bombs..." No, the Soviets went ahead and developed a hydrogen bomb too. So the point is, it was very unlikely that either superpower would ever deploy these bombs against one another because to do so would virtually guarantee mutual assured destruction 相互确保摧毁. But regardless, this kind of one-upmanship 争强好胜；互相攀比 was a key feature in how the Cold War was waged. +

And then fourth, the Cold War was waged through a series of proxy wars 代理人战争. Now a proxy war is a war in which major powers support opposing sides of a smaller war. So the US and Soviet Union never officially started firing at each other directly, but they did get involved on opposite sides of smaller conflicts, and therefore could fight each other without actually fighting each other. And you do need to know a couple of these, so let's start with the Korean War 朝鲜战争. +

After Japan was defeated in World War II, its former colony Korea was divided along the 38th parallel 三八线. The Soviets occupied the North and the US occupied the South. And in 1949, both armies withdrew, and North Korea became communist while South Korea was more democratic. In 1950, the communist North invaded the South, and the US and Soviet Union almost immediately got involved with money and troops. And ultimately, after both sides gaining and losing territory, the war ended right where it began, with the two countries divided by the 38th parallel. +

Now another similar proxy war was the Vietnam War 越南战争. And I say similar because Vietnam was also divided into North and South after World War II, with more of a US-friendly government in the South and a communist government in the North. The fighting began, and the South Vietnamese were supported by the United States while North Vietnam was supported by China and the Soviet Union. Ultimately, this war cost millions of lives on both sides, and basically like Korea, it ended in a stalemate 僵局. +

Under this heading, finally let's talk about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 苏联入侵阿富汗. Now in 1979, there was trouble in Afghanistan -- at least from the Soviet perspective. Anti-communist guerrillas 反共产主义游击队 were attempting to overthrow 推翻 the communist government there. So the Soviet Union invaded to support the communists. And while the United States didn't send troops, they did send a metric buttload of weapons to support those who were attempting the overthrow. And this became a long and protracted war 持久战 that really only ended when the Soviet Union withdrew in 1989. +

So the point is, even though the Soviets and the Americans didn't come to blows 发生冲突；大打出手 directly during the Cold War, they did fight each other through these other world conflicts. +

== 中文释义

好的，第二次世界大战结束了，哎呀，能放松一阵子，不用再面对那些引发战争的紧张局势，那该多好啊。哎呀糟糕，冷战来了。是的，就在第二次世界大战结束后，另一场全球冲突开始酝酿，在这个视频里，我会把一切都告诉你。所以，如果你准备好以“遏制政策”的视角来获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

正如你能想象的那样，在经历了**"第二次世界大战"**带来的巨大死亡和破坏之后，每个人都想恢复正常生活。但甚至在战争结束之前，美国和苏联之间就开始酝酿新的紧张局势。**在战争接近尾声时，“三巨头”—— 包括英国、苏联和美国 —— 召开了一系列三次会议(三方会议?)。**在这些会议上，除了其他事项之外，**他们商讨了战后欧洲在胜利之后的样子。其中一个关键的协议是，东欧国家将被允许通过民主选举, 来选择他们的领导人和政府。**这当然对美国和英国来说是好事，但在苏联这边，斯大林心想：“不管怎样”，他们达成了协议，然后继续打完了战争。 +

顺便说一下，如果你想在一个视频里看到第9单元的总结，还有练习题以及在五月考试中得5分所需的一切，那就看看我的AP复习资料包，简介里有链接。 +

*他们达成的另一个重要协议是，*"国际联盟"有点没用。记住，第一次世界大战结束后，战胜国成立了"国际联盟"，作为一个国际组织，为各国领导人提供一个通过外交手段解决问题的地方，而不是通过战争。但从第二次世界大战比第一次世界大战更具破坏性这一事实来看，国际联盟并没能真正做到它原本应该做的事情。所以“三巨头”一致认为应该成立另一个国际组织，这次叫做**"联合国"（the United Nations），希望它能够做到"国际联盟"做不到的事情，也就是避免另一场国际战争。** +

**但尽管战后成立了联合国，它也没能阻止冷战的发生。**你看，战争结束后，斯大林认为那些东欧国家并没有真正做好自决的准备。相反，苏联把这些国家纳入了所谓的苏联阵营。这些卫星国变成了共产主义国家，它们的经济是为苏联服务，而不是为自己服务。但要记住，*“三巨头”之间的协议是, 这些国家将举行民主选举。但在斯大林看来，这些国家可以成为欧洲和苏联之间的缓冲区。所以，这一举措导致了猜疑和相互不信任的开始。* +

然后，美国和苏联之间的不信任进一步加剧，**对战后德国的处理, 让这两个超级大国之间的分歧更大了。**战后，德国被分成了四个占领区，苏联、法国、英国和美国各占领一块。这次占领本应是暂时的，但由苏联控制的东德, 很快变成了另一个共产主义国家。**苏联想让德国保持虚弱，这样德国的威胁就会变小(中国对日本的态度, 也是这样)。**而且你知道，在这一点上很难责怪斯大林，毕竟在两次世界大战中，德国在俄罗斯造成了难以言喻的破坏和死亡。但如果你还记得上一个视频的内容，**美国想要一个强大的德国，因为这将带来一个稳定的欧洲。**但斯大林不这么想，所以他加强了对东德的控制，这进一步加剧了紧张局势。 +

所以在这一点上，很明显欧洲存在着严重的"意识形态"和政治紧张局势，以至于前英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔（Winston Churchill）说，一道“铁幕”降临在了欧洲大陆。换句话说，民主欧洲和共产主义欧洲之间的分裂完成了。 +

我们马上要谈谈"冷战"是如何展开的，但为了理解冷战为什么会是现在这个样子，你必须了解美国的“遏制”政策。因为斯大林似乎想让整个世界都变成苏联共产主义的样子，*美国总统哈里·杜鲁门（Harry Truman）提出了所谓的“#杜鲁门主义#”（the Truman Doctrine），“遏制”共产主义是其中的一个重要驱动力。基本上，杜鲁门主义表示，#任何觉得自己受到共产主义威胁的国家, 都可以期望从美国获得财政和军事援助。#* +

"杜鲁门主义"面临的第一个考验是希腊的内战。在希腊为控制权而战的两个派别，你可能已经猜到了，是"共产主义力量"和"反共产主义力量"。所以英国开始支持反共产主义力量，而苏联支持共产主义力量。然而，英国最终不得不暂时抽身处理自己的问题，所以在杜鲁门主义的支持下，美国介入并向"反共产主义力量"提供财政援助，以防止希腊落入共产主义之手。结果是，"反共产主义力量"获胜，这次胜利进一步加剧了冷战中的紧张局势。 +

好的，从定义上来说，冷战不是美国和苏联之间的武装战斗。之所以被称为“冷战”，是因为这两个国家相互之间存在直接的紧张关系，随时可能开战，但最终并没有真正交战。然而，这并不意味着没有战争行为，在这里我们需要看看这两个大国是如何进行长达数十年的对峙的。 +

首先，冷战在欧洲大陆上通过宣传运动展开。“自由欧洲电台”（Radio Free Europe）向苏联领土广播，颂扬自由和民主的优点。为了应对这一点，苏联的宣传强调西方资本主义的贪婪，更不用说美国严重的种族紧张局势了。想想看，如果这些现实仍然存在，民主又能好到哪里去呢？ +

其次，**冷战通过秘密行动展开。**这里我们说的是那些像电视剧里演的精彩的间谍活动。美国成立了中央情报局（Central Intelligence Agency，CIA）来处理所有的秘密行动。英国有它的秘密情报局，苏联有克格勃（KGB）。**所有这些机构负责向敌方领土派遣间谍，**收集有关武器集结的信息，并**了解他们在冷战中的下一步行动。** +

第三，**冷战以"军备竞赛"的形式展开，**也就是说，特别是核武器的集结。记住，美国在第二次世界大战结束时开发并部署了世界上第一批核弹，这对日本的广岛和长崎造成了巨大破坏。事实证明，美国使用这些核弹,却没有告诉斯大林他们拥有这种技术，这让斯大林作为独裁者的自尊心受到了伤害。再说一次，就像我之前说的，不信任在战争结束前就开始了。那么当世界上另一个超级大国开发出这种能摧毁城市的爆炸技术时，苏联会怎么做呢？他们会意识到核扩散的可怕后果并拒绝参与这种竞赛吗？别傻了。斯大林开始研发同样的技术。为此，**苏联在1949年成功试爆了他们的第一颗原子弹。**为了不被超越，杜鲁门下令研发氢弹，**氢弹的破坏力是原子弹的大约一千倍。**斯大林心想：“你们知道吗，我觉得这太过分了，我不想生活在一个有氢弹的世界里……” 不，苏联也继续研发了氢弹。所以关键是，两个超级大国都不太可能向对方部署这些核弹，因为这么做实际上会导致相互毁灭。但不管怎样，这种相互竞争是冷战的一个关键特征。 +

第四，**冷战通过一系列"代理人战争"展开。所谓代理人战争，是指大国支持一场小规模战争中的对立双方。所以美国和苏联从未正式直接向对方开火，但他们确实参与了一些小规模冲突的对立双方，因此在没有真正交战的情况下相互对抗。**你需要了解其中的几个例子，那我们就从朝鲜战争开始说起。 +

在第二次世界大战中日本战败后，它的前殖民地朝鲜沿着三八线被分割。苏联占领了北方，美国占领了南方。1949年，双方军队都撤离了，北朝鲜变成了共产主义国家，而南朝鲜更加民主。1950年，共产主义的北朝鲜入侵南朝鲜，美国和苏联几乎立即投入资金和军队介入。最终，在双方都有领土得失之后，战争又回到了原点，两国还是以三八线为界分割开来。 +

另一场类似的代理人战争是越南战争。我说它类似，是因为第二次世界大战后, 越南也被分成了北越和南越，南越有一个更亲美的政府，北越则是共产主义政府。战斗开始了，南越得到了美国的支持，而北越得到了中国和苏联的支持。最终，这场战争导致双方都有数百万人丧生，而且基本上和朝鲜战争一样，以僵局告终。 +

在这个主题下，最后我们来谈谈苏联入侵阿富汗。1979年，阿富汗出现了问题 —— 至少从苏联的角度来看是这样。**反共产主义游击队试图推翻那里的共产主义政府。所以苏联入侵阿富汗以支持共产主义者。**虽然美国没有派遣军队，但他们确实提供了大量武器来支持那些试图推翻政府的人。这成了一场漫长而持久的战争，直到1989年苏联撤军，战争才真正结束。 +

所以重点是，尽管在冷战期间, 苏联和美国没有直接交战，但他们确实通过这些其他的世界冲突相互对抗。 +

All right, so World War II is over, and oh man, is it going to be nice just to chill for a while, not have to deal with all the tensions that caused the war in the first place? Ah crap, here comes the Cold War. Yes, right on the heels of the close of World War II, another global conflict started brewing, and in this video I'm going to tell you all about it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked containment style, then let's get to it.

Now as you can imagine, after the cataclysmic proportions of death and destruction that occurred in World War II, everyone wanted to return to normalcy. But even before the war ended, a new tension was brewing between the United States and the Soviet Union. Now near the end of the war, the Big Three -- which included Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States -- met in a series of three conferences. And in these conferences, among other things, they negotiated what a post-war Europe would look like after their victory. One of the key agreements was that Eastern European nations would be allowed to choose their leaders and governments through democratic elections. That of course was great for the United States and Britain, but over in the Soviet Union, Stalin was like, "But regardless," they made the agreement and went ahead and finished fighting the war.

And by the way, if you want Unit 9 summarized in a single video along with practice questions and everything you need to get a five on your exam in May, then check out my AP review pack, which is linked in the description.

Now another one of the major agreements they made was that the League of Nations was kind of a turd. Now remember that after World War I was over, the victorious powers established the League as an international body that would provide a place for heads of nations to work their problems out through diplomacy instead of war. But just by the fact that there was a World War II -- which was even more destructive than World War I -- should tell you that the League of Nations couldn't really do what it was intended to do. So the Big Three agreed that another international body ought to be created, this time called the United Nations, which would hopefully be able to do what the League of Nations could not -- namely, avoid another international war.

But despite the establishment of the United Nations after the war, it could not keep the Cold War from happening. You see, after the war was over, Stalin decided that those Eastern European nations were not really ready for self-determination. Instead, the Soviet Union absorbed those nations into what became known as the Soviet bloc.

But from Stalin's point of view, these states could act as kind of a buffer zone between Europe and the Soviet Union. And so as a result of that move, the suspicion and mutual distrust began.

And then to add further distrust between the US and the Soviet Union, the handling of post-war Germany further divided the two superpowers. After the war, Germany was divided into four occupation zones -- the Soviets, the French, the British, and the US each claiming one quadrant. Now this occupation was meant to be temporary, but East Germany, dominated by the Soviets, quickly became another communist state. The Soviets wanted to keep Germany weak so that they would be less of a threat. And you know, you could hardly blame Stalin on this count -- like, so far in two world wars, Germany had caused untold destruction and death in Russia. But if you remember from the last video, the US wanted a strong Germany because that would lead to a stable Europe. But Stalin would have none of this, and so instead he tightened his grip on East Germany, and thus more tension.

So by this point, it was clear that there was a significant ideological and political tension in Europe -- so much so that former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that an iron curtain had descended across the continent. In other words, the division between democratic Europe and communist Europe was complete.

Now we're going to talk about how the Cold War was waged in a moment, but in order to understand why the Cold War took the shape that it did, you have to understand the United States' policy of containment. Now because Stalin appeared to want the whole world made over in the image of Soviet communism, American President Harry Truman articulated what became known as the Truman Doctrine, of which containment of communism was a significant driving force. Basically, the Truman Doctrine said that any country who felt itself under the threat of communism could expect financial and military assistance from the United States.

Now the first test for the Truman Doctrine became a civil war in Greece. And the two factions fighting for control in Greece were -- would you know it -- communist and anti-communist forces. So Britain began supporting the anti-communists while the Soviet Union supported the communist cause. However, Britain ended up having to step out and deal with their own problems for a while, and so under the aegis of the Truman Doctrine, the United States stepped in to provide financial aid to the anti-communist forces so that Greece would not fall to communism. Now as it turned out, the anti-communist forces won, and that victory only further increased the division manifest in the Cold War tension.

Okay, so the Cold War by definition was not an armed battle between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rather, it was called a cold war because the two nations stood in direct tension with one another and could go to war at any moment, but ultimately they did not. However, that doesn't mean that war was not waged, and here we need to look at how these two powers waged their decades-long standoff.

First, the Cold War was waged through propaganda campaigns on the European continent. Radio Free Europe broadcast signals into Soviet territories extolling the virtues of freedom and democracy. And so in order to combat this, Soviet propaganda emphasized the capitalistic greed of the West, not to mention the profound racial tension in the United States.

The United Kingdom had their Secret Intelligence Service, and the Soviet Union had the KGB. And all these agencies were responsible for sending spies into enemy territory to gather information on the buildup of weapons and to discover what their next steps in the Cold War should be.

And third, the Cold War was waged in the form of an arms race, which is to say the buildup of especially nuclear weapons. Now remember, the United States had developed and deployed the world's first nuclear bombs at the end of World War II, which devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. And as it turns out, Stalin got his authoritarian feelings hurt when the US used these bombs and never told him that they had such a technology.

To which Stalin said, "You know guys, I think this has gone too far, and I don't want to live in a world where hydrogen bombs..." No, the Soviets went ahead and developed a hydrogen bomb too. So the point is, it was very unlikely that either superpower would ever deploy these bombs against one another because to do so would virtually guarantee mutual assured destruction. But regardless, this kind of one-upmanship was a key feature in how the Cold War was waged.

And then fourth, the Cold War was waged through a series of proxy wars. Now a proxy war is a war in which major powers support opposing sides of a smaller war. So the US and Soviet Union never officially started firing at each other directly, but they did get involved on opposite sides of smaller conflicts, and therefore could fight each other without actually fighting each other. And you do need to know a couple of these, so let's start with the Korean War.

And ultimately, after both sides gaining and losing territory, the war ended right where it began, with the two countries divided by the 38th parallel.

Now another similar proxy war was the Vietnam War. And I say similar because Vietnam was also divided into North and South after World War II, with more of a US-friendly government in the South and a communist government in the North. The fighting began, and the South Vietnamese were supported by the United States while North Vietnam was supported by China and the Soviet Union. Ultimately, this war cost millions of lives on both sides, and basically like Korea, it ended in a stalemate.

Under this heading, finally let's talk about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Now in 1979, there was trouble in Afghanistan -- at least from the Soviet perspective.
