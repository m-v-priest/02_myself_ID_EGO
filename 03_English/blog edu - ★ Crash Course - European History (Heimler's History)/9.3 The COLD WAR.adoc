== 释义

All right, so World War II is over, and oh man, _is it going to be nice_ just to chill (v.)放松；休息;冷静；镇静 for a while, not have to *deal with* all the tensions 紧张局势 that caused the war _in the first place_ 首先，最初? Ah crap 糟糕、讨厌的事;屎;废话；胡说；胡扯, here comes the Cold War. Yes, right _on the heels of_ 紧接着；紧随其后 the close of World War II, another global conflict started (v.) brewing 酝酿,策划阴谋, and in this video /I'm going to tell you all about it.  +
So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked containment 遏制；牵制 style, then let's get to it. +

[.my2]
好吧，第二次世界大战已经结束了，哎呀，能暂时放松一下真是太好了，不用再应对那些导致战争的种种紧张局势了。哎呀糟糕，冷战又来了。没错，就在第二次世界大战结束之后不久，另一场全球性的冲突就开始酝酿起来了。

.Ah crap
用来表达 ​​“糟糕！”、“该死！”、“真倒霉！”​​ 之类的负面情绪，通常用于突然意识到坏事发生或遇到挫折时。 +

"Ah"​​： 表示突然的醒悟或感叹，类似中文的 ​​“啊”​​。 +
"crap"​​： 字面意思是“粪便”，但在口语中作为 ​​“shit”（屎）​​ 的委婉替代词，表示 ​​“糟糕、讨厌的事”​​。 +
合起来​​： ​​“啊，糟了！”​​ 或 ​​“靠，完了！”​​（根据语气强弱调整）。 +

Now as you can imagine, after _the cataclysmic 大灾难的；灾难性的 proportions_ 比例；大小 of death and destruction /that occurred in World War II, everyone wanted *to return to* normalcy (n.)常态,正常状态. But even before the war ended, a new tension was brewing *between* the United States *and* the Soviet Union.  +
Now near the end of the war, the Big Three 三巨头 -- which included Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States -- met in _a series of_ 一系列，一连串 three conferences. And in these conferences, among other things, they negotiated (v.)谈判；协商 what a post-war Europe would look like /after their victory. One of the key agreements was that /Eastern European nations would be allowed to choose their leaders and governments through democratic elections. That _of course_ was great /for the United States and Britain, but over in the Soviet Union 在苏联那边, Stalin was like, "But regardless (不顾，不加理会；不管怎样，无论如何)但无论如何,但管他呢, they made the agreement /and went ahead and finished fighting the war. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.But regardless
是一个​​语气强烈的转折短语​​，直译为 ​​“但无论如何”​​ 或 ​​“但管他呢”​​，实际传递的是斯大林对协议的​​轻蔑态度​​和​​单方面无视承诺​​的意图。

regardless"​​ = 不管、不顾（regard是“考虑”，加 -less表示“不考虑”）。 +
*"but regardless"​​ = ​​“但尽管如此”​​ / ​​“但老子才不管”​*​（根据语气强弱）。

And by the way 顺便说一下, if you want Unit 9 summarized in a single video along with practice questions and everything you need to get a five on your exam in May, then check out my AP review pack, which is linked in the description. +

Now `主` another one of the major agreements they made `系` was that /the League of Nations 国际联盟 was kind of a turd 粪，粪便；可鄙的人. Now remember that /after _World War I_ was over, the victorious powers 战胜国 established (v.) the League as an international body 国际机构 /that would provide a place 地点，场所 for heads of nations /*to work* their problems *out* 解决问题 /through diplomacy 外交手段 *instead of* war.  +
But `主` just _by the fact that_ there was a World War II -- which was even more destructive  (a.)破坏性的，毁灭性的 than World War I -- `谓` should tell you that 应该告诉你 the League of Nations couldn't really do _what it was intended to do_. So the Big Three agreed that /another international body ought to be created, this time called the United Nations 联合国, which would hopefully be able to do _what the League of Nations could not_ -- namely, avoid (v.) another international war. +

[.my2]
他们达成的另一项重要协议是，"国际联盟"其实是个糟糕的机构。要知道，在第一次世界大战结束后，战胜国设立了"国际联盟"这一国际组织，旨在为各国首脑提供一个通过外交而非战争来解决分歧的平台。*但仅仅因为第二次世界大战的爆发*（这场战争比第一次世界大战更具破坏性）**就足以让你明白，**国际联盟实际上无法实现其预期目标。所以，这三位元首一致认为应当创建另一个国际组织，这次被称为联合国，希望它能够做到"国际联盟做不到的事情"——即避免再次爆发国际战争。

But despite the establishment of the United Nations after the war, it could not *keep* the Cold War *from* happening. You see, after the war was over, Stalin decided that /those Eastern European nations were not really *ready for* self-determination 自决权. Instead, the Soviet Union *absorbed* (v.)吞并；吸收 those nations *into* what became known as the Soviet bloc 苏联集团. These satellite nations 卫星国 became communist, and their economies were made (v.) to serve the Soviet Union *instead of* themselves. But remember, `主` the agreement between the Big Three `系` was that these nations would hold (v.) democratic elections. But from Stalin's point of view, these states could *act as* kind of a buffer zone 缓冲区 between Europe and the Soviet Union. And so *as a result of* that move, the suspicion 怀疑 and mutual distrust 相互不信任 began (v.). +

image:/img/the Soviet bloc 2.avif[,100%]




And then to add  (v.) further distrust between the US and the Soviet Union, `主` the handling 拿；处理，应付；操纵 of post-war Germany `谓` further divided the two superpowers. After the war, Germany was divided into four occupation zones 占领区 -- the Soviets, the French, the British, and the US each claiming (v.) one quadrant 四分之一圆（或圆周）；象限；区域. Now this occupation was meant to be temporary 暂时的, but East Germany, dominated by the Soviets, quickly became another communist state. The Soviets wanted to keep Germany weak /so that they would be less of a threat. And you know, you could hardly blame Stalin on this count (（讨论或争论的）论点，观点，问题，事项)从这方面来说 -- like, so far 到目前为止 in two world wars, Germany had caused (v.) untold (a.)难以形容的（大、恶劣等） destruction and death in Russia. But if you remember from the last video, the US wanted a strong Germany /because that would lead to a stable Europe. But Stalin would have none of this, and so instead /he tightened (v.) his grip on 加强对……的控制 East Germany, and thus more tension. +

So by this point 到这个时候, it was clear /that there was a significant ideological 意识形态的 and political tension in Europe -- *so much 如此之甚以至于 /so that 以至于*  former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that /an iron curtain 铁幕 had descended (v.)下来，下降 across the continent. In other words, the division between democratic Europe and communist Europe was complete. +

[.my1]
.案例

....so much /so that ...
直译为 ​​“到如此程度，以至于…”​

​​"so much"​​：指代前文提到的“意识形态和政治紧张”（significant ideological and political tension），强调其​​程度之深​​。 +
​*"so that"​​：引导结果状语从句，表示 ​​“以至于…”*​​。 +
合起来​​：​​“紧张局势如此严重，以至于…”​​ → 突出因果关系。

Now we're going to talk about how the Cold War was waged  (v.)进行；开始;发动；开展 in a moment 立刻,立即,一会儿,马上, but in order to understand why the Cold War *took the shape* 呈现出某种形状或特征 that it did, you have to understand the United States' policy of containment 控制，抑制；（对他国力量的）遏制.  Now because Stalin appeared to want the whole world *made over* 改造；修饰；彻底改变形象 in the image of Soviet communism, American President Harry Truman articulated (v.)明确表达 what became known as _the Truman Doctrine_ 杜鲁门主义, of which `主` containment of communism `系` was a significant driving force 驱动力. Basically, the Truman Doctrine said that /`主` any country who felt itself under the threat of communism `谓` could expect financial and military assistance from the United States. +

Now the first test for _the Truman Doctrine_ became a civil war 内战 in Greece.

.Greek Civil War  希腊内战
发生于 1946 年至 1949 年。这场冲突爆发于第二次世界大战结束后不久，**是共产党领导的反抗希腊王国既定政府的起义。叛军**宣布成立人民共和国 ， 即希腊临时民主政府 ，**由希腊共产党 (KKE) 及其军事分支希腊民主军 (DSE) 统治。**叛军得到了阿尔巴尼亚和南斯拉夫的支持。*在英国和美国的支持下，希腊政府军最终取得了胜利。*

这场战争是左右翼意识形态高度两极化斗争的产物，这场斗争始于二战期间轴心国占领期（1941-1944 年）结束后，双方都瞄准了权力真空 。**这场斗争是冷战期间的首场代理人战争 ，**也是盟军战后首次干涉他国内政，这是美国外交官乔治·凯南在 1946 年 2 月的长电报中提出的遏制政策的实施。 **希腊王国政府最终获得了美国的资助（通过 1947 年的杜鲁门主义和 1948 年的马歇尔计划 ），并加入了北约 （1952 年）。** +
与此同时，苏联领导人约瑟夫·斯大林希望结束战争 ，而南斯拉夫领导人约瑟普·布罗兹·铁托则希望战争继续下去。


*1941 年 4 月，轴心国军队逼近雅典 ，* 乔治二世国王及其政府逃往埃及 ，并在那里成立了流亡政府 。与此同时，*德国人在雅典建立了一个缺乏合法性和支持率的通敌政府 。#占领造成的权力真空, 被多个抵抗运动填补，这些运动的意识形态从君主制到共产主义 ，不一而足。#*

希腊内战（1946-1949）是第二次世界大战结束后，在希腊发生的，以意识形态为核心的内战。它被普遍认为是冷战的第一场“热战”，深刻地影响了战后世界的格局。

|前因（起因与背景）
|希腊内战的爆发可以追溯到二战期间国内形成的复杂局面：

- 德国占领时期：1941年德国入侵希腊后，国内形成了多股抵抗力量。其中最主要的是两支：

.. 民族解放阵线（EAM）：由希腊共产党（KKE）主导，拥有强大的军事力量，即希腊人民解放军（ELAS），控制了希腊大部分农村地区。

.. 民族主义力量：主要是以君主制支持者和保皇党为主的非共产党抵抗组织，势力较弱。

- 意识形态分歧：在抵抗德国的同时，EAM和民族主义者之间的意识形态和政治分歧日益加深。EAM希望在战后建立一个左翼政府，而民族主义者则希望恢复君主制，并与西方盟国保持紧密联系。

- 英国的介入：英国担心希腊成为苏联的势力范围，因此支持民族主义者。1944年，英军登陆希腊，协助希腊政府军打击EAM。在雅尔塔协定中，丘吉尔和斯大林私下达成协议，将希腊划为英国的势力范围，这在一定程度上限制了苏联对希腊共产党的大规模直接援助。

|过程（战争发展）
|希腊内战大致可分为两个阶段：

第一阶段（1944-1946）：

德国撤离后，希腊政府军和EAM-ELAS之间爆发了激烈的武装冲突。 +
1945年，双方签署了《瓦尔基扎协定》，要求ELAS解除武装。然而，该协定并未完全解决根本矛盾，许多左翼人士拒绝缴械，转入地下活动。 +
随着政治压迫和报复行动的增加，新的武装冲突于1946年再次爆发，内战正式拉开序幕。 +

第二阶段（1947-1949）：

随着战争的持续，希腊共产党得到了南斯拉夫、阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚等邻国的支持，建立了临时民主政府。 +
转折点：此时，英国因自身经济衰退无力继续提供援助，于1947年宣布将撤出。 +
美国迅速接替了英国的角色。杜鲁门总统发表了著名的杜鲁门主义，宣布美国将向希腊和土耳其提供军事和经济援助，以阻止共产主义扩张。这标志着美国正式介入欧洲事务，开启了冷战。 +
在美国的大量援助下，希腊政府军获得了先进的武器和军事顾问。而共产党游击队则因南斯拉夫与苏联关系破裂而失去主要支持，补给线被切断。 +

|后果（结果与影响）
|- 希腊政府军的胜利：1949年，由于失去了外部援助，希腊共产党游击队最终被政府军击败。内战结束，希腊被牢牢地纳入了西方阵营。

- 杜鲁门主义的成功：这次胜利被认为是美国遏制共产主义扩张政策的首次成功，为后来的马歇尔计划和北约组织打下了基础。

- 冷战格局的固化：希腊内战明确地划清了欧洲的意识形态分界线。它表明美苏两大阵营已进入全面对抗，通过支持各自的代理人来争夺全球影响力。希腊的案例也成为日后冷战中许多局部冲突的模板。

Okay, so the Cold War by definition `系` was not an armed battle 武装冲突 between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rather, it was called a cold war /because the two nations stood in direct tension 处于直接紧张关系状态 with one another /and could go to war at any moment, but ultimately they did not. However, that doesn't mean that /war was not waged 进行；开始, and here we need to look at /how these two powers waged (v.) their decades-long 长达数十年的 standoff 对峙,僵局. +

First, the Cold War was waged through propaganda campaigns 宣传运动 on the European continent. Radio Free Europe 自由欧洲电台 *broadcast* (v.)散布，传播（信息等） signals (n.) *into* Soviet territories /extolling (v.)颂扬；赞美 the virtues of freedom and democracy. And so /in order to combat 对抗；抵抗 this, Soviet propaganda emphasized (v.) the capitalistic greed 资本主义贪婪 of the West, not to mention 更不用说 the profound racial tension 种族紧张局势 in the United States. Like, how good _could democracy be_ 民主能有多好 /if those realities still exist? +

[.my2]
首先，冷战是在欧洲大陆通过宣传攻势展开的。自由欧洲电台向苏联领土播送信号，宣扬自由与民主的种种优点。因此，为了对抗这种宣传，苏联的宣传则强调西方的资本主义贪婪，更不用说美国内部严重的种族矛盾了。比如，如果这些现实依然存在，民主还能有多好呢？

Second, the Cold War was waged (v.) through covert (a.)隐蔽的，秘密的 actions 秘密行动. And here we're talking about _those juicy 多汁的，汁液丰富的；生动有趣的 made-for-television realities_ of spying 间谍活动 and espionage 间谍行为. The United States created _the Central Intelligence Agency_ (or CIA) 中央情报局 to handle (v.) all of its clandestine (a.)秘密的，私下的；偷偷摸摸的 operations 秘密行动. The United Kingdom had their _Secret Intelligence Service_ 秘密情报局, and the Soviet Union had the KGB 克格勃. And all these agencies were responsible for *sending* spies *into* enemy territory /to gather (v.)收集，采集 information on the buildup 增强；发展；形成 of weapons 武器储备 /and to discover (v.)  what their next steps in the Cold War should be. +

[.my2]
其次，冷战是以秘密行动的形式展开的。这里我们所谈论的，是那些适合电视播出的有关间谍活动和情报收集的真实故事。美国成立了中央情报局（简称 CIA）来负责其所有的秘密行动。英国有其秘密情报局，而苏联则有克格勃。这些机构都负责派遣间谍进入敌方领土，收集有关武器部署的信息，并探究在冷战中接下来应采取何种策略。

.the Central Intelligence Agency

image:/img/Central Intelligence Agency.webp[,50%]


The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA /ˌsiː.aɪˈeɪ/) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States tasked with advancing national security through collecting and analyzing intelligence from around the world and conducting covert operations. The agency is headquartered in the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Langley, Virginia, and is sometimes metonymously called "Langley". A major member of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA has reported to the director of national intelligence since 2004, and is focused on providing intelligence for the president and the Cabinet.

中央情报局 （ CIA /ˌsiː.aɪˈeɪ/ ）是美国联邦政府下属的一个**文职对外情报机构，** 其任务是通过收集、分析来自世界各地的情报, 并开展秘密行动, 来维护国家安全 。**该机构总部位于弗吉尼亚州兰利的乔治·布什情报中心 ，有时也被戏称为“兰利”。**作为美国情报界 （IC）的重要成员，中央情报局自 2004 年以来一直**向"国家情报总监"汇报工作，**并致力于为总统和内阁提供情报。

**在美军和美国政府机构的语境中，#"civilian"（文职）通常与 "military"（军事）相对。# +
##军事机构：由军人组成，遵循军事法律和指挥链，##例如陆军、海军、空军等。 +
#文职机构：由非军人（文职人员）组成，遵循民事法律和政府行政管理体系。# ** +

所以，当维基百科说CIA是一个 "civilian foreign intelligence service" 时，它是在说明**：#CIA的员工主要是文职人员，而不是军人。它不属于美国国防部（Department of Defense）的管辖范围，而是一个独立的政府机构，直接向美国总统负责。#** +
这与像"国防情报局"（Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA）这样的机构形成了对比，后者是国防部下属的军事情报机构，其工作人员以军人为主。 +

#*与联邦调查局 (FBI) 不同，中央情报局不具备执法职能，而是专注于海外情报收集， 国内情报收集有限 。*#

The director of the Central Intelligence Agency (D/CIA) is appointed by the president with Senate confirmation and reports directly to the director of national intelligence (DNI); in practice, the CIA director interfaces with the DNI, Congress, and the White House, while the deputy director (DD/CIA) is the internal executive of the CIA and the chief operating officer (COO/CIA), known as executive director until 2017, leads the day-to-day work[8] as the third-highest post of the CIA.[9] The deputy director is formally appointed by the director without Senate confirmation,[9][10] but as the president's opinion plays a great role in the decision,[10] the deputy director is generally considered a political position, making the chief operating officer the most senior non-political position for CIA career officers.[11]

美国情报部门总体预算的细节属于机密。

The role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) in Germany, MI6 in the United Kingdom, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) in Australia, the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) in France, the Foreign Intelligence Service in Russia, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in India, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Pakistan, the General Intelligence Service in Egypt, Mossad in Israel, and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) in South Korea.

And third, the Cold War was waged in the form of an arms race 军备竞赛, which is to say /the buildup of especially nuclear weapons 核武器.

Now remember, the United States had developed and deployed 部署 the world's first nuclear bombs /at the end of World War II, which devastated 摧毁；毁坏 Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.  And as it turns out 事实证明, Stalin *got* _his authoritarian 独裁的；专制的 feelings_ *hurt* /when the US used these bombs /and never told him that they had such a technology. Again, as I said before, the distrust started (v.) /before the end of the war.  +

So what's the Soviet Union going to do /when the only other superpower in the world has developed this city-destroying explosive technology? Do they realize the horrible implications 蕴含，含义；（可能带来的）影响 of nuclear proliferation (（数量的）激增，剧增) 核扩散 /and refuse (v.) to play that game? Don't be crazy 别天真了.

Now Stalin *got to work* 开始工作 developing the same technology. To that end 为了那个目的，为了达到那个目标, the Soviets successfully tested their first atomic bomb 原子弹 in 1949.

*Not to be outdone* (v.)(胜过；优于) 不想被超过;不甘落后, Truman ordered (v.) the development of the hydrogen bomb 氢弹, which had something like a thousand times 倍 *more* destructive capacity 破坏力 *than* an atomic bomb.  +
To which /Stalin said, "You know guys, I think this has gone too far, and I don't want to live in a world /where hydrogen bombs..." No, the Soviets went ahead /and developed a hydrogen bomb too.

So the point is, it was very unlikely /that either superpower would ever deploy (v.) these bombs against one another /because `主` to do so `谓` would virtually 事实上，几乎 guarantee (v.)确保，保证；担保 _mutual assured destruction_ 相互确保摧毁（MAD）. But regardless, this kind of one-upmanship (n.)胜人一筹；能胜人一筹的办法;争强好胜；互相攀比 was a key feature /in how the Cold War was waged. +

[.my2]
第三，冷战以军备竞赛的形式展开，即​​尤其是核武器​​的疯狂扩张。别忘了，美国在二战末期研发并投下了全球首枚核弹，摧毁了日本的广岛和长崎。而事实证明，斯大林对美国使用这种武器却未事先告知, 深感其"威权自尊"受挫——正如我之前所说，双方的猜忌早在战争结束前就已埋下。那么，当全球唯二的超级大国掌握了这种足以抹平城市的毁灭性技术后，苏联会作何反应？他们是否意识到核扩散的恐怖后果, 而拒绝参与这场死亡游戏？别天真了。斯大林立刻下令研发同类武器。为此，苏联于1949年成功试爆首颗原子弹。不甘示弱的杜鲁门随即启动氢弹研发计划，其威力堪比原子弹的千倍。对此斯大林表态："诸位，我认为局势已失控，我绝不接受一个氢弹存在的世……"——想多了，苏联转头也造出了氢弹。关键在于，两大超级大国几乎不可能真正对彼此动用这些武器，因为一旦出手，​​"确保相互毁灭"​​（MAD）的结局将无可避免。但即便如此，这种​​“你强我要更强”​​的攀比, 仍是冷战的核心特征。

And then fourth, the Cold War was waged through a series of proxy wars 代理人战争. Now a proxy war is a war /in which major powers support (v.) opposing sides of a smaller war 一场小规模战争的对立双方. So the US and Soviet Union never officially started (v.) firing at each other directly, but they did get involved on opposite sides of smaller conflicts, and therefore could fight (v.) each other /without actually fighting each other. And you do need to know a couple of these, so let's start with the Korean War 朝鲜战争. +

After Japan was defeated in World War II, its former colony Korea was divided along the 38th parallel （地球的）纬线. The Soviets occupied the North /and the US occupied the South. And in 1949, both armies withdrew, and North Korea became communist /while South Korea was more democratic. In 1950, the communist North invaded the South, and the US and Soviet Union almost immediately got involved with money and troops. And ultimately, after both sides gaining and losing territory, the war ended (v.) right _where it began_, with the two countries divided by the 38th parallel. +

Now another similar proxy war was the Vietnam War 越南战争. And I say similar /because Vietnam was also divided into North and South after World War II, with more of a US-friendly government in the South /and a communist government in the North. The fighting began, and the South Vietnamese were supported by the United States /while North Vietnam was supported by China and the Soviet Union. Ultimately, this war cost (v.) millions of lives on both sides, and basically like Korea, it ended in a stalemate 僵局；陷于困境. +

Under this heading, finally let's talk about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 苏联入侵阿富汗. Now in 1979, there was trouble in Afghanistan -- at least from the Soviet perspective （观察问题的）视角，观点. Anti-communist guerrillas 反共产主义游击队 were attempting to overthrow 推翻 the communist government there. So the Soviet Union invaded to support the communists. And while the United States didn't send troops, they did send _a metric buttload of_ weapons to support (v.) those who were attempting the overthrow. And this became a long and protracted (a.)拖延的 war 持久战 /that really only ended (v.) when the Soviet Union withdrew in 1989. +

这场战争的根源非常复杂，主要有以下几个方面：

- 阿富汗国内的政治动荡：20世纪70年代，阿富汗国内政治动荡不安。**1973年，阿富汗国王被推翻，**成立共和国。1978年，**亲苏联的阿富汗"人民民主党"发动政变，掌握了政权。这个政党试图推行激进的社会主义改革，**如土地改革和男女平等，*但这些改革措施与阿富汗根深蒂固的伊斯兰传统和部落文化格格不入，引发了广泛的抵制和武装反抗。*

- 苏联的担忧：**苏联领导人担心阿富汗的亲苏政权会垮台，**从而失去这个重要的战略盟友，**并可能被一个亲西方的政府取代。此外，苏联也担心阿富汗的伊斯兰原教旨主义运动, 会蔓延到苏联自身的中亚地区，**影响其内部稳定。

- 赫菲佐拉·阿明的上台：1979年，**人民民主党内部发生权力斗争，强硬派领导人赫菲佐拉·阿明夺权**并杀死了前领导人塔拉基。阿明虽然名义上亲苏，但他的独断专行, 和对反对派的残酷镇压, 使得苏联对其产生了疑虑。**苏联担心阿明会背叛他们，**甚至可能倒向美国。*为了重新控制局面，苏联最终决定采取军事行动，推翻阿明政权。*

过程（战争经过） +
1979年12月24日，**苏联出兵入侵阿富汗。**苏军迅速占领了喀布尔，**杀死了阿明，并扶植了一个新的亲苏政权。**然而，苏联的军事行动遭到了阿富汗人民的强烈抵抗。

- 圣战者（Mujahideen）的崛起：在乡村地区，大量阿富汗人组织起来，成立了各种武装组织，统称为“圣战者”。他们坚信这场战争是为信仰而战的“圣战”，因此战斗意志非常顽强。

- 西方国家的援助：美国、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯等国家, 向圣战者提供了大量的武器、资金和培训。其中，美国中央情报局（CIA）提供的“毒刺”地对空导弹, 对苏军的直升机和飞机构成了巨大威胁，极大地削弱了苏军的空中优势。

- 苏联的困境：苏军虽然装备精良，但面对圣战者利用阿富汗复杂地形（多山）进行的游击战，显得束手无策。苏联陷入了一场无法取胜的消耗战，付出了巨大的经济和人员代价，被称为苏联的“越南战争”。

在经历了十年毫无进展的战争后，1989年2月15日，最后一批苏军撤出了阿富汗。

后果（战争的影响） +

- 对阿富汗的影响：长期战乱：**苏联撤军后，阿富汗**并没有迎来和平，而是**陷入了各派圣战者之间的内战。这为后来的塔利班崛起埋下了伏笔。**
- 加剧冷战对抗：苏联入侵阿富汗被西方国家视为其全球扩张的标志，**导致美苏关系急剧恶化。**美国总统吉米·卡特因此抵制了1980年莫斯科奥运会，并恢复了对苏联的粮食禁运。
- 美国在中东的介入：**美国通过援助圣战者，**成功地“流干了”苏联的血液，但**无意中也扶植了日后许多激进的伊斯兰主义组织，其中包括本·拉登的基地组织，**这为后来的9/11事件埋下了隐患。

== 中文释义

好的，第二次世界大战结束了，哎呀，能放松一阵子，不用再面对那些引发战争的紧张局势，那该多好啊。哎呀糟糕，冷战来了。是的，就在第二次世界大战结束后，另一场全球冲突开始酝酿，在这个视频里，我会把一切都告诉你。所以，如果你准备好以“遏制政策”的视角来获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

正如你能想象的那样，在经历了**"第二次世界大战"**带来的巨大死亡和破坏之后，每个人都想恢复正常生活。但甚至在战争结束之前，美国和苏联之间就开始酝酿新的紧张局势。**在战争接近尾声时，“三巨头”—— 包括英国、苏联和美国 —— 召开了一系列三次会议(三方会议?)。**在这些会议上，除了其他事项之外，**他们商讨了战后欧洲在胜利之后的样子。其中一个关键的协议是，东欧国家将被允许通过民主选举, 来选择他们的领导人和政府。**这当然对美国和英国来说是好事，但在苏联这边，斯大林心想：“不管怎样”，他们达成了协议，然后继续打完了战争。 +

顺便说一下，如果你想在一个视频里看到第9单元的总结，还有练习题以及在五月考试中得5分所需的一切，那就看看我的AP复习资料包，简介里有链接。 +

*他们达成的另一个重要协议是，*"国际联盟"有点没用。记住，第一次世界大战结束后，战胜国成立了"国际联盟"，作为一个国际组织，为各国领导人提供一个通过外交手段解决问题的地方，而不是通过战争。但从第二次世界大战比第一次世界大战更具破坏性这一事实来看，国际联盟并没能真正做到它原本应该做的事情。所以“三巨头”一致认为应该成立另一个国际组织，这次叫做**"联合国"（the United Nations），希望它能够做到"国际联盟"做不到的事情，也就是避免另一场国际战争。** +

**但尽管战后成立了联合国，它也没能阻止冷战的发生。**你看，战争结束后，斯大林认为那些东欧国家并没有真正做好自决的准备。相反，苏联把这些国家纳入了所谓的苏联阵营。这些卫星国变成了共产主义国家，它们的经济是为苏联服务，而不是为自己服务。但要记住，*“三巨头”之间的协议是, 这些国家将举行民主选举。但在斯大林看来，这些国家可以成为欧洲和苏联之间的缓冲区。所以，这一举措导致了猜疑和相互不信任的开始。* +

然后，美国和苏联之间的不信任进一步加剧，**对战后德国的处理, 让这两个超级大国之间的分歧更大了。**战后，德国被分成了四个占领区，苏联、法国、英国和美国各占领一块。这次占领本应是暂时的，但由苏联控制的东德, 很快变成了另一个共产主义国家。**苏联想让德国保持虚弱，这样德国的威胁就会变小(中国对日本的态度, 也是这样)。**而且你知道，在这一点上很难责怪斯大林，毕竟在两次世界大战中，德国在俄罗斯造成了难以言喻的破坏和死亡。但如果你还记得上一个视频的内容，**美国想要一个强大的德国，因为这将带来一个稳定的欧洲。**但斯大林不这么想，所以他加强了对东德的控制，这进一步加剧了紧张局势。 +

所以在这一点上，很明显欧洲存在着严重的"意识形态"和政治紧张局势，以至于前英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔（Winston Churchill）说，一道“铁幕”降临在了欧洲大陆。换句话说，民主欧洲和共产主义欧洲之间的分裂完成了。 +

我们马上要谈谈"冷战"是如何展开的，但为了理解冷战为什么会是现在这个样子，你必须了解美国的“遏制”政策。因为斯大林似乎想让整个世界都变成苏联共产主义的样子，*美国总统哈里·杜鲁门（Harry Truman）提出了所谓的“#杜鲁门主义#”（the Truman Doctrine），“遏制”共产主义是其中的一个重要驱动力。基本上，杜鲁门主义表示，#任何觉得自己受到共产主义威胁的国家, 都可以期望从美国获得财政和军事援助。#* +

"杜鲁门主义"面临的第一个考验是希腊的内战。在希腊为控制权而战的两个派别，你可能已经猜到了，是"共产主义力量"和"反共产主义力量"。所以英国开始支持反共产主义力量，而苏联支持共产主义力量。然而，英国最终不得不暂时抽身处理自己的问题，所以在杜鲁门主义的支持下，美国介入并向"反共产主义力量"提供财政援助，以防止希腊落入共产主义之手。结果是，"反共产主义力量"获胜，这次胜利进一步加剧了冷战中的紧张局势。 +

好的，从定义上来说，冷战不是美国和苏联之间的武装战斗。之所以被称为“冷战”，是因为这两个国家相互之间存在直接的紧张关系，随时可能开战，但最终并没有真正交战。然而，这并不意味着没有战争行为，在这里我们需要看看这两个大国是如何进行长达数十年的对峙的。 +

首先，冷战在欧洲大陆上通过宣传运动展开。“自由欧洲电台”（Radio Free Europe）向苏联领土广播，颂扬自由和民主的优点。为了应对这一点，苏联的宣传强调西方资本主义的贪婪，更不用说美国严重的种族紧张局势了。想想看，如果这些现实仍然存在，民主又能好到哪里去呢？ +

其次，**冷战通过秘密行动展开。**这里我们说的是那些像电视剧里演的精彩的间谍活动。美国成立了中央情报局（Central Intelligence Agency，CIA）来处理所有的秘密行动。英国有它的秘密情报局，苏联有克格勃（KGB）。**所有这些机构负责向敌方领土派遣间谍，**收集有关武器集结的信息，并**了解他们在冷战中的下一步行动。** +

第三，**冷战以"军备竞赛"的形式展开，**也就是说，特别是核武器的集结。记住，美国在第二次世界大战结束时开发并部署了世界上第一批核弹，这对日本的广岛和长崎造成了巨大破坏。事实证明，美国使用这些核弹,却没有告诉斯大林他们拥有这种技术，这让斯大林作为独裁者的自尊心受到了伤害。再说一次，就像我之前说的，不信任在战争结束前就开始了。那么当世界上另一个超级大国开发出这种能摧毁城市的爆炸技术时，苏联会怎么做呢？他们会意识到核扩散的可怕后果并拒绝参与这种竞赛吗？别傻了。斯大林开始研发同样的技术。为此，**苏联在1949年成功试爆了他们的第一颗原子弹。**为了不被超越，杜鲁门下令研发氢弹，**氢弹的破坏力是原子弹的大约一千倍。**斯大林心想：“你们知道吗，我觉得这太过分了，我不想生活在一个有氢弹的世界里……” 不，苏联也继续研发了氢弹。所以关键是，两个超级大国都不太可能向对方部署这些核弹，因为这么做实际上会导致相互毁灭。但不管怎样，这种相互竞争是冷战的一个关键特征。 +

第四，**冷战通过一系列"代理人战争"展开。所谓代理人战争，是指大国支持一场小规模战争中的对立双方。所以美国和苏联从未正式直接向对方开火，但他们确实参与了一些小规模冲突的对立双方，因此在没有真正交战的情况下相互对抗。**你需要了解其中的几个例子，那我们就从朝鲜战争开始说起。 +

在第二次世界大战中日本战败后，它的前殖民地朝鲜沿着三八线被分割。苏联占领了北方，美国占领了南方。1949年，双方军队都撤离了，北朝鲜变成了共产主义国家，而南朝鲜更加民主。1950年，共产主义的北朝鲜入侵南朝鲜，美国和苏联几乎立即投入资金和军队介入。最终，在双方都有领土得失之后，战争又回到了原点，两国还是以三八线为界分割开来。 +

另一场类似的代理人战争是越南战争。我说它类似，是因为第二次世界大战后, 越南也被分成了北越和南越，南越有一个更亲美的政府，北越则是共产主义政府。战斗开始了，南越得到了美国的支持，而北越得到了中国和苏联的支持。最终，这场战争导致双方都有数百万人丧生，而且基本上和朝鲜战争一样，以僵局告终。 +

在这个主题下，最后我们来谈谈苏联入侵阿富汗。1979年，阿富汗出现了问题 —— 至少从苏联的角度来看是这样。**反共产主义游击队试图推翻那里的共产主义政府。所以苏联入侵阿富汗以支持共产主义者。**虽然美国没有派遣军队，但他们确实提供了大量武器来支持那些试图推翻政府的人。这成了一场漫长而持久的战争，直到1989年苏联撤军，战争才真正结束。 +

所以重点是，尽管在冷战期间, 苏联和美国没有直接交战，但他们确实通过这些其他的世界冲突相互对抗。 +

All right, so World War II is over, and oh man, is it going to be nice just to chill for a while, not have to deal with all the tensions that caused the war in the first place? Ah crap, here comes the Cold War. Yes, right on the heels of the close of World War II, another global conflict started brewing, and in this video I'm going to tell you all about it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked containment style, then let's get to it.

Now as you can imagine, after the cataclysmic proportions of death and destruction that occurred in World War II, everyone wanted to return to normalcy. But even before the war ended, a new tension was brewing between the United States and the Soviet Union. Now near the end of the war, the Big Three -- which included Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States -- met in a series of three conferences. And in these conferences, among other things, they negotiated what a post-war Europe would look like after their victory. One of the key agreements was that Eastern European nations would be allowed to choose their leaders and governments through democratic elections. That of course was great for the United States and Britain, but over in the Soviet Union, Stalin was like, "But regardless," they made the agreement and went ahead and finished fighting the war.

And by the way, if you want Unit 9 summarized in a single video along with practice questions and everything you need to get a five on your exam in May, then check out my AP review pack, which is linked in the description.

Now another one of the major agreements they made was that the League of Nations was kind of a turd. Now remember that after World War I was over, the victorious powers established the League as an international body that would provide a place for heads of nations to work their problems out through diplomacy instead of war. But just by the fact that there was a World War II -- which was even more destructive than World War I -- should tell you that the League of Nations couldn't really do what it was intended to do. So the Big Three agreed that another international body ought to be created, this time called the United Nations, which would hopefully be able to do what the League of Nations could not -- namely, avoid another international war.

But despite the establishment of the United Nations after the war, it could not keep the Cold War from happening. You see, after the war was over, Stalin decided that those Eastern European nations were not really ready for self-determination. Instead, the Soviet Union absorbed those nations into what became known as the Soviet bloc. These satellite nations became communist, and their economies were made to serve the Soviet Union instead of themselves. But remember, the agreement between the Big Three was that these nations would hold democratic elections. But from Stalin's point of view, these states could act as kind of a buffer zone between Europe and the Soviet Union. And so as a result of that move, the suspicion and mutual distrust began.

And then to add further distrust between the US and the Soviet Union, the handling of post-war Germany further divided the two superpowers. After the war, Germany was divided into four occupation zones -- the Soviets, the French, the British, and the US each claiming one quadrant. Now this occupation was meant to be temporary, but East Germany, dominated by the Soviets, quickly became another communist state. The Soviets wanted to keep Germany weak so that they would be less of a threat. And you know, you could hardly blame Stalin on this count -- like, so far in two world wars, Germany had caused untold destruction and death in Russia. But if you remember from the last video, the US wanted a strong Germany because that would lead to a stable Europe. But Stalin would have none of this, and so instead he tightened his grip on East Germany, and thus more tension.

So by this point, it was clear that there was a significant ideological and political tension in Europe -- so much so that former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that an iron curtain had descended across the continent. In other words, the division between democratic Europe and communist Europe was complete.

Now we're going to talk about how the Cold War was waged in a moment, but in order to understand why the Cold War took the shape that it did, you have to understand the United States' policy of containment. Now because Stalin appeared to want the whole world made over in the image of Soviet communism, American President Harry Truman articulated what became known as the Truman Doctrine, of which containment of communism was a significant driving force. Basically, the Truman Doctrine said that any country who felt itself under the threat of communism could expect financial and military assistance from the United States.

Now the first test for the Truman Doctrine became a civil war in Greece. And the two factions fighting for control in Greece were -- would you know it -- communist and anti-communist forces. So Britain began supporting the anti-communists while the Soviet Union supported the communist cause. However, Britain ended up having to step out and deal with their own problems for a while, and so under the aegis of the Truman Doctrine, the United States stepped in to provide financial aid to the anti-communist forces so that Greece would not fall to communism. Now as it turned out, the anti-communist forces won, and that victory only further increased the division manifest in the Cold War tension.

Okay, so the Cold War by definition was not an armed battle between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rather, it was called a cold war because the two nations stood in direct tension with one another and could go to war at any moment, but ultimately they did not. However, that doesn't mean that war was not waged, and here we need to look at how these two powers waged their decades-long standoff.

First, the Cold War was waged through propaganda campaigns on the European continent. Radio Free Europe broadcast signals into Soviet territories extolling the virtues of freedom and democracy. And so in order to combat this, Soviet propaganda emphasized the capitalistic greed of the West, not to mention the profound racial tension in the United States. Like, how good could democracy be if those realities still exist?

Second, the Cold War was waged through covert actions. And here we're talking about those juicy made-for-television realities of spying and espionage. The United States created the Central Intelligence Agency (or CIA) to handle all of its clandestine operations. The United Kingdom had their Secret Intelligence Service, and the Soviet Union had the KGB. And all these agencies were responsible for sending spies into enemy territory to gather information on the buildup of weapons and to discover what their next steps in the Cold War should be.

And third, the Cold War was waged in the form of an arms race, which is to say the buildup of especially nuclear weapons. Now remember, the United States had developed and deployed the world's first nuclear bombs at the end of World War II, which devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. And as it turns out, Stalin got his authoritarian feelings hurt when the US used these bombs and never told him that they had such a technology. Again, as I said before, the distrust started before the end of the war. So what's the Soviet Union going to do when the only other superpower in the world has developed this city-destroying explosive technology? Do they realize the horrible implications of nuclear proliferation and refuse to play that game? Don't be crazy. Now Stalin got to work developing the same technology. To that end, the Soviets successfully tested their first atomic bomb in 1949. Not to be outdone, Truman ordered the development of the hydrogen bomb, which had something like a thousand times more destructive capacity than an atomic bomb. To which Stalin said, "You know guys, I think this has gone too far, and I don't want to live in a world where hydrogen bombs..." No, the Soviets went ahead and developed a hydrogen bomb too. So the point is, it was very unlikely that either superpower would ever deploy these bombs against one another because to do so would virtually guarantee mutual assured destruction. But regardless, this kind of one-upmanship was a key feature in how the Cold War was waged.

And then fourth, the Cold War was waged through a series of proxy wars. Now a proxy war is a war in which major powers support opposing sides of a smaller war. So the US and Soviet Union never officially started firing at each other directly, but they did get involved on opposite sides of smaller conflicts, and therefore could fight each other without actually fighting each other. And you do need to know a couple of these, so let's start with the Korean War.

After Japan was defeated in World War II, its former colony Korea was divided along the 38th parallel. The Soviets occupied the North and the US occupied the South. And in 1949, both armies withdrew, and North Korea became communist while South Korea was more democratic. In 1950, the communist North invaded the South, and the US and Soviet Union almost immediately got involved with money and troops. And ultimately, after both sides gaining and losing territory, the war ended right where it began, with the two countries divided by the 38th parallel.

Now another similar proxy war was the Vietnam War. And I say similar because Vietnam was also divided into North and South after World War II, with more of a US-friendly government in the South and a communist government in the North. The fighting began, and the South Vietnamese were supported by the United States while North Vietnam was supported by China and the Soviet Union. Ultimately, this war cost millions of lives on both sides, and basically like Korea, it ended in a stalemate.

Under this heading, finally let's talk about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Now in 1979, there was trouble in Afghanistan -- at least from the Soviet perspective. Anti-communist guerrillas were attempting to overthrow the communist government there. So the Soviet Union invaded to support the communists. And while the United States didn't send troops, they did send a metric buttload of weapons to support those who were attempting the overthrow. And this became a long and protracted war that really only ended when the Soviet Union withdrew in 1989.

So the point is, even though the Soviets and the Americans didn't come to blows directly during the Cold War, they did fight each other through these other world conflicts.
