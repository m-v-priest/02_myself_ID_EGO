== 释义

So we've been talking about the shift 转变 towards absolutism 专制主义 in Europe /during the period 1648 to 1815, and if a king or queen is going to be the _big stinky (a.)发恶臭的，十分难闻的；<非正式>令人厌恶的，糟糕透顶的 cheese_ 干酪，奶酪；（拍照时让人微笑的用语）笑一笑；大人物，大亨（俚语，重要人物） of their state 国家；州，邦, then they're going to have to *rake (v.)（用耙子）耙 up some scratch* 耙出一些刮痕（俚语，赚钱） to make it happen.  +
So in this video, we're going to talk about _the economics of absolutism_ 绝对主义的经济基础, namely 即 mercantilism 重商主义.  +
So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked favorable balance of trade 贸易顺差 style, then let's get to it. +

我们一直在讨论1648到1815年间欧洲向绝对主义的转变。如果一个国王或女王想成为国家说一不二的‘大人物’，他们就得想办法搞到钱。所以本期视频，我们要聊绝对主义的经济基础——重商主义。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Big stinky cheese​
字面意思是“发臭的大奶酪”. 在俚语中，big cheese 常用来指“大人物”或“重要角色”（类似中文的“大咖”“头儿”）。加上 stinky（臭的）可能是为了幽默化表达，暗讽绝对主义君主虽然权力很大，但可能专横、惹人厌（比如路易十四的“朕即国家”）。

.Rake up some scratch​
字面意思​​：rake up（耙到一起），scratch（抓挠）。 +

实际含义​​： +
*Scratch 在俚语中常指“钱”（尤其现金），类似 dough 或 bread。* +
*Rake up 这里指“筹集”或“搞到”。* +
*合起来就是​​“搞钱”或“筹集资金”​*​，对应君主需要敛财来维持绝对权力（比如通过重税、垄断贸易等）。 +

例句​​："To build Versailles, Louis XIV had to rake up some serious scratch."
（为了建凡尔赛宫，路易十四不得不搞一大笔钱。） +
====

So first, let's start by defining (v.) mercantilism. By the way 顺便说一下, if you want follow-along notes 配套笔记 for this video, then check the link in the description.

So mercantilism 重商主义 is _a state-driven economic system_ 国家主导的经济体系 which emphasizes (v.)强调 the buildup 积累 of mineral wealth 矿产财富 *by means of* 通过 _a favorable 有利的；良好的 balance_ of trade 贸易顺差. Now there are _three parts to that definition_ that we need to unpack (v.)剖析;打开包裹；分析. +

First, mercantilism is a state-driven economic system. If you've ever taken an economics class 如果你上过经济学课, you know there's a difference *between* what's called a _command economy_ 指令经济;计划经济 *and* a _market economy_ 市场经济.  +
`主` A classic example 典型例子 of a _command economy_ that you'll learn about in that class `系` is Soviet Russia's communist state 苏联共产主义国家. In Soviet Russia, the state set (v.) all the prices 设定所有价格, the state said all the work hours 规定所有工作时长, the state set (v.) all the work days 设定所有工作日, the state decided what should *be manufactured* (v.) and how much 决定生产什么和生产多少, _and on and on_ 等等.
Therefore, in a command economy 指令经济, the state makes all the economic decisions 做出所有经济决策 or _at least_ most of them.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.and on and on
是一个​​非正式的口语表达​​，通常用在列举一系列类似事物之后，表示​​“诸如此类”“以此类推”“没完没了”​​，暗示类似的情况还有很多，但不必一一列举。

替换表达​​： +
and so on（等等） +
and so forth（以及其他） +
et cetera（拉丁语缩写 etc.，意为“等等”） +


====

A _market economy_, on the other hand 另一方面, is one 后定 characterized (V.) by 以……为特征 private economic decisions 私人经济决策 -- like the state isn't guiding (v.) the economics 指导经济, but rather individuals and private entities 私人实体. `主` The classic example here `系` is the United States. +

Now the point is 关键是, when we talk about mercantilism 重商主义, it is likely an economic system 后定 that you have never heard of before, and so it can be helpful *to compare it to* a system that you have heard 与之比较. In that way, a mercantilist state 重商主义国家 is a lot like Soviet Russia economically 在经济上很像苏联 -- the state makes (v.) all the decisions 国家做出所有决策. +

Okay, now `主` _the second part of that definition_ we need to consider `系` is the emphasis on _the buildup 增强；发展；形成 of mineral wealth_. When I say _mineral wealth_, I mean gold and silver 金银. Like the motto 座右铭 of the mercantile estate 重商主义国家 is, "`主` *He* _who dies with the most gold_ `谓` *wins* (v.)."  谁死时金子最多，谁就赢了. +
And here's where we need to talk about pie 馅饼. Think about it for a minute: if wealth is measured (v.) in terms of 以……衡量 gold and silver, then there's only a finite amount 有限数量的 of  wealth in the world. There's only so much gold and silver that you can dig out of the mountains 从山里挖出来.  +
And so under the mercantilist worldview 重商主义世界观, wealth was kind of like a pie, and the pie only has so many slices 切片. And that means (v.) if a _mercantile 贸易的，商业的；营利主义的 estate_ 财产，遗产；大片私有土地，庄园 wants more mineral wealth 矿产财富 -- and you know that was the goal 目标 -- then *that means (v.) that* somebody has to get less pie.  +
And that's why, not surprisingly 不足为奇, mercantilism *led to* intense rivalries 激烈竞争 among European states 欧洲国家 because, hey, who doesn't want more pie? +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Mercantile estate
在上下文中，​​"mercantile estate"​​ 并不是一个标准的历史或经济学术语，而是作者（或演讲者）为了​​形象化表达​​而使用的​​比喻性说法​​，实际指的是​​奉行重商主义（mercantilism）的国家或政权​​。

字面拆解​​： +
Mercantile：形容词，意为“商业的”或“重商主义的”（与 mercantilism 相关）。 +
Estate：通常指“庄园”或“阶层”，但在这里比喻为​​“政治实体”或“国家”​​（类似 kingdom 或 state）。 +
合起来可理解为​​“重商主义国家”​​或​​“追求商业财富的政权”​​。 +
====

All right, now `主` _the third part of that definition_ we need to consider `系` is the means 方法 by which a mercantile estate is going to get more of that pie, namely 即 by maintaining (v.) _a favorable balance_ of trade 维持贸易顺差. And they maintained (v.) a favorable balance of trade /by having more exports than imports 出口大于进口.  +
And it's not hard to understand why 不难理解原因: if the goal is to accumulate (v.)积累 mineral wealth, then exporting (v.) goods 出口商品 is good /because that means (v.) gold and silver are coming into the state 金银流入国家. But if a state imports (v.) lots of goods 进口大量商品, then that means (v.) their gold and silver are leaving and going to other states 金银流向其他国家. +

Now whatever you might think about mercantilism as a system 作为一种体系, it did have the effect of 产生……效果 giving Europe an increasingly dominant position 日益主导的地位 in the world economy 世界经济.  +
And `主` one of the main drivers 主要驱动力 of that system during this period `系` was the expansion of empire 帝国扩张 and the robust trade 繁荣的贸易 that occurred because of it.  +

Establishing (v.) colonies 建立殖民地 was a major goal 主要目标 of mercantilist states 重商主义国家 for two reasons.  +
First, colonies were able *to provide raw materials 原材料 in abundance* 大量地 for the manufacturing of goods 制造商品. For example, the abundant forests in British North America 英属北美 provided (v.) timber 木材 for shipbuilding 造船, and the French colonies in the Caribbean 加勒比海的法国殖民地 provided (v.) sugar and coffee in abundance 大量的糖和咖啡.  +

`主` The second reason _mercantile estates_ were driven (v.) *to 受驱使去 establish (v.) colonies* `系` is that they provided new markets 新市场 for their manufactured goods 制成品.  +
So raw materials were extracted (v.) from the colonies 从殖民地开采, then shipped (v.) back to the parent country 运回母国, and then made into manufactured goods 制成制成品, and then sold right back to their colonial population 再卖回殖民地.
If colonial people are buying a state's goods 殖民地人民购买商品, that maintains (v.) a favorable balance of trade 维持贸易顺差 because gold and silver are remaining (v.)保持不变；遗留；尚待处理 within the possession 拥有，持有 of the imperial state 金银留在帝国手中. +

Now probably one of the clearest examples 最明显的例子 of this `系` was the British Navigation Acts 英国航海条例, which *were first established* (v.)  by Oliver Cromwell 奥利弗·克伦威尔. This series of laws 一系列法律 mandated (v.)授权；命令；托管；强制执行;强制规定 that `主` goods 后定 shipped from Europe to Britain `谓` were required to be transported (v.)运输；搬运 on British ships with British crew 由英国船只和船员运输.  +
Furthermore 此外, that meant (v.) the colonial peoples were required to trade (v.) only with Britain 殖民地人民只能与英国贸易.  +
And this is straight mercantilist 纯粹的重商主义 -- like get _as much of the gold as you can_ by any kind of behavior (任何一种行为) 不择手段获取金银. And that was going to cause (v.) tension 引发紧张关系 because it was not _in the colony's best interest_ 不符合殖民地利益 *to trade (v.) only with* Britain, and that's going to be _one part_ of _what eventually *leads to* the American Revolution_ 美国独立战争. +

All right, now let's consider (v.) the effects 影响 of this kind of economic system *in terms of* 就……而言 worldwide trade 世界贸易.  +
First, there was an increased (a.) demand for 需求增加 New World products 新大陆产品 like sugar and rice. And because new products and new foods were being introduced to Europe from the Americas 从美洲引入欧洲, and because the rise of the middle class 中产阶级崛起 who could afford (v.) such products 买得起这些产品, a new consumer culture 消费文化 was on the rise 兴起.  +

Second, with this increasing demand for goods 商品需求增加 / *came (v.) an increasing demand* for labor 劳动力需求增加, and `主` *that `谓` largely came from* enslaved Africans 主要来自非洲奴隶. As indigenous laborers 土著劳动力 quickly died off 死亡 because of European diseases 欧洲疾病, European plantation owners 种植园主 increasingly *turned to* African slave laborers 非洲奴隶 to work (v.) their land 为他们劳作.  +
And the increased demand on the African slave trade 非洲奴隶贸易需求增加 was one part of the larger economic pattern 更大的经济模式 known as the Triangular Trade 三角贸易, which described (v.) a three-part transmission of goods 商品的三部分流转 across the Atlantic 跨大西洋.  +

And here's how it went 流程如下: `主` finished (a.) European goods 欧洲制成品 like guns and textiles 枪支和纺织品 `谓` would *be shipped (v.) to* Africa 运往非洲 and *exchanged (v.) for* enslaved labor 换取奴隶. Then they would *head (v.) across the Atlantic* through the brutal Middle Passage (中间通道；中央航路) 残酷的跨大西洋航程 where the Africans suffered (v.) malnourishment 营养不良 and disease 疾病, only *to be traded* in the colonies *for* raw materials 原材料 like cotton and tobacco and sugar 棉花、烟草和糖, which would then *be shipped back to* Europe 运回欧洲. +

== 中文释义

所以我们一直在谈论**1648年至1815年期间, 欧洲向"专制主义"的转变，**如果一位国王或女王想要成为他们国家的“大独裁者”，那么他们将不得不敛财来实现这一目标。所以在这个视频中，我们将谈论"专制主义的经济"，也就是"重商主义"。所以如果你准备好以"贸易顺差"的方式充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

所以首先，让我们从定义"重商主义"开始。顺便说一下，如果你想要这个视频的配套笔记，那么查看描述中的链接。*#重商主义是一种由国家驱动的经济体系(就像中国的"计划经济"一样)，它通过"贸易顺差"来强调积累矿产财富(即金银)#*。现在我们需要剖析这个定义的三个部分。  +

首先，重商主义是一种由国家驱动的经济体系。如果你上过经济学课程，你就知道**所谓的"计划经济"和"市场经济"之间是有区别的。**你在那门课上会学到的"计划经济"的一个典型例子是苏联（Soviet Russia）的共产主义国家。**在苏联，国家设定所有的价格，国家规定所有的工作时间，国家决定所有的工作日，国家决定生产什么以及生产多少，等等。因此，在"计划经济"中，国家做出所有的经济决策，或者至少是大部分决策。另一方面，#"市场经济"的特点是由私人做出经济决策#——也就是说国家不指导经济，而是由个人和私人实体来决定生产多少和销售多少。**这里的典型例子是美国。  +

现在重点是，当我们谈论"重商主义"时，它是一种你可能从未听说过的经济体系，所以将它与你听说过的体系进行比较, 是有帮助的。从这个角度看，*重商主义国家在经济上,很像苏联——国家做出所有决策。*  +

好的，现在我们需要考虑这个定义的**第二部分，即强调积累矿产财富(金银)。**当我说矿产财富时，我指的是黄金和白银。*重商主义国家的座右铭是：“谁死的时候拥有最多的黄金，谁就是赢家。”* 在这里我们需要谈谈“馅饼”。想一下：**如果财富是以黄金和白银来衡量的，那么世界上的财富数量是有限的。**从山里能挖出的黄金和白银数量是有限的。**所以在重商主义的世界观中，财富就像一个馅饼(蛋糕)，而且馅饼的切片数量是有限的(他们认为蛋糕没法做大, 只能分蛋糕, 就是零和博弈了)。**这意味着如果一个重商主义国家, 想要更多的矿产财富——你知道这是他们的目标——那么就意味着有人会得到更少的“馅饼”。**这就是为什么重商主义导致了欧洲各国之间的激烈竞争(零和博弈嘛)，**因为，嘿，谁不想要更多的“馅饼”呢？  +

好的，现在我们需要考虑这个定义的第三部分，即**#重商主义国家获得更多“馅饼”的手段，也就是通过保持"贸易顺差"。#**他们通过出口大于进口, 来保持贸易顺差。这不难理解：*#如果目标是积累矿产财富，那么出口商品是有益的，因为这意味着黄金和白银会流入这个国家。但如果一个国家进口大量商品，那么这意味着他们的黄金和白银会流向其他国家。#*  +

现在，无论你如何看待"重商主义"这个体系，它确实使欧洲在世界经济中, 占据了越来越主导的地位。在这一时期，这个体系的主要驱动力之一, 是帝国的扩张, 以及由此产生的蓬勃贸易。**#建立"殖民地"是重商主义国家的一个主要目标，原因有两个。首先，殖民地能够为商品制造提供丰富的原材料。#**例如，英属北美（British North America）丰富的森林, 为造船提供了木材，加勒比地区的法国殖民地, 提供了大量的糖和咖啡。重商主义国家建立"殖民地"的**第二个原因是，#殖民地为他们(即母国)的制成品, 提供了新的市场。 所以, 原材料从殖民地被开采出来，然后运回宗主国，接着被制成制成品，然后再卖回殖民地的民众手中。(相当于母国是处在产业链高端的位置, 殖民地是处在产业链低端的位置)#**如果殖民地人民购买一个国家的商品，这就保持了"贸易顺差"，因为黄金和白银留在了帝国手中。  +

现在，这方面最明显的**例子之一是##英国的《航海条例》##**（British Navigation Acts），它最初是由奥利弗·克伦威尔（Oliver Cromwell）制定的。**这一系列法律##规定，从欧洲运往英国的商品, 必须由英国船只和英国船员运输。此外，这意味着殖民地人民只能与英国进行贸易。##这完全是"重商主义"——就像通过各种行为尽可能多地获取黄金一样。**这会引发紧张局势，因为只与英国进行贸易不符合殖民地的最大利益，而这也是最终导致美国独立战争（American Revolution）的一个因素。  +

好的，现在让我们从世界贸易的角度, 来考虑这种经济体系的影响。 +
首先，对新世界产品，如糖和大米的需求增加了。而且由于从美洲引入了新的产品和食物，**并且由于中产阶级的崛起，他们能够购买这些产品，一种新的消费文化正在兴起。** +
其次，**随着对商品需求的增加，对劳动力的需求也增加了，**而这些劳动力在很大程度上来自被奴役的非洲人。由于欧洲的疾病，当地的劳动力迅速死亡，欧洲种植园主越来越多地转向非洲奴隶劳动力来耕种他们的土地。

对非洲奴隶贸易需求的增加, 是被称为"三角贸易"（Triangular Trade）的更大经济模式的一部分，三角贸易描述了跨大西洋的三部分商品运输。具体过程是这样的：欧洲的制成品，如枪支和纺织品，被运往非洲，用来交换被奴役的劳动力。然后他们会穿越残酷的“中间航程”（Middle Passage），在这段航程中，非洲人遭受营养不良和疾病的折磨，最后在殖民地用这些奴隶交换棉花、烟草和糖等原材料，然后这些原材料被运回欧洲。  +

关于这个话题就讲到这里。这里是第三单元的其他主题视频。你也可以点击这里获取我的美国大学预修课程欧洲历史复习资料包，它对帮助你准备考试非常有用。这样你可以在课堂上得A，在五月份的考试中得5分。我们下次再见。我下线了。  +

So we've been talking about the shift towards absolutism in Europe during the period 1648 to 1815, and if a king or queen is going to be the big stinky cheese of their state, then they're going to have to rake up some scratch to make it happen. So in this video, we're going to talk about the economics of absolutism, namely mercantilism. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked favorable balance of trade style, then let's get to it.

So first, let's start by defining mercantilism. By the way, if you want follow-along notes for this video, then check the link in the description. So mercantilism is a state-driven economic system which emphasizes the buildup of mineral wealth by means of a favorable balance of trade. Now there are three parts to that definition that we need to unpack.

First, mercantilism is a state-driven economic system. If you've ever taken an economics class, you know there's a difference between what's called a command economy and a market economy. A classic example of a command economy that you'll learn about in that class is Soviet Russia's communist state. In Soviet Russia, the state set all the prices, the state said all the work hours, the state set all the work days, the state decided what should be manufactured and how much, and on and on. Therefore, in a command economy, the state makes all the economic decisions or at least most of them. A market economy, on the other hand, is one characterized by private economic decisions -- like the state isn't guiding the economics, but rather individuals and private entities. The classic example here is the United States.

Now the point is, when we talk about mercantilism, it is likely an economic system that you have never heard of before, and so it can be helpful to compare it to a system that you have heard. In that way, a mercantilist state is a lot like Soviet Russia economically -- the state makes all the decisions.

Okay, now the second part of that definition we need to consider is the emphasis on the buildup of mineral wealth. When I say mineral wealth, I mean gold and silver. Like the motto of the mercantile estate is, "He who dies with the most gold wins." And here's where we need to talk about pie. Think about it for a minute: if wealth is measured in terms of gold and silver, then there's only a finite amount of wealth in the world. There's only so much gold and silver that you can dig out of the mountains. And so under the mercantilist worldview, wealth was kind of like a pie, and the pie only has so many slices. And that means if a mercantile estate wants more mineral wealth -- and you know that was the goal -- then that means that somebody has to get less pie. And that's why, not surprisingly, mercantilism led to intense rivalries among European states because, hey, who doesn't want more pie?

All right, now the third part of that definition we need to consider is the means by which a mercantile estate is going to get more of that pie, namely by maintaining a favorable balance of trade. And they maintained a favorable balance of trade by having more exports than imports. And it's not hard to understand why: if the goal is to accumulate mineral wealth, then exporting goods is good because that means gold and silver are coming into the state. But if a state imports lots of goods, then that means their gold and silver are leaving and going to other states.

Now whatever you might think about mercantilism as a system, it did have the effect of giving Europe an increasingly dominant position in the world economy. And one of the main drivers of that system during this period was the expansion of empire and the robust trade that occurred because of it. Establishing colonies was a major goal of mercantilist states for two reasons. First, colonies were able to provide raw materials in abundance for the manufacturing of goods. For example, the abundant forests in British North America provided timber for shipbuilding, and the French colonies in the Caribbean provided sugar and coffee in abundance. The second reason mercantile estates were driven to establish colonies is that they provided new markets for their manufactured goods. So raw materials were extracted from the colonies, then shipped back to the parent country, and then made into manufactured goods, and then sold right back to their colonial population. If colonial people are buying a state's goods, that maintains a favorable balance of trade because gold and silver are remaining within the possession of the imperial state.

Now probably one of the clearest examples of this was the British Navigation Acts, which were first established by Oliver Cromwell. This series of laws mandated that goods shipped from Europe to Britain were required to be transported on British ships with British crew. Furthermore, that meant the colonial peoples were required to trade only with Britain. And this is straight mercantilist -- like get as much of the gold as you can by any kind of behavior. And that was going to cause tension because it was not in the colony's best interest to trade only with Britain, and that's going to be one part of what eventually leads to the American Revolution.

All right, now let's consider the effects of this kind of economic system in terms of worldwide trade. First, there was an increased demand for New World products like sugar and rice. And because new products and new foods were being introduced to Europe from the Americas, and because the rise of the middle class who could afford such products, a new consumer culture was on the rise. Second, with this increasing demand for goods came an increasing demand for labor, and that largely came from enslaved Africans. As indigenous laborers quickly died off because of European diseases, European plantation owners increasingly turned to African slave laborers to work their land. And the increased demand on the African slave trade was one part of the larger economic pattern known as the Triangular Trade, which described a three-part transmission of goods across the Atlantic. And here's how it went: finished European goods like guns and textiles would be shipped to Africa and exchanged for enslaved labor. Then they would head across the Atlantic through the brutal Middle Passage where the Africans suffered malnourishment and disease, only to be traded in the colonies for raw materials like cotton and tobacco and sugar, which would then be shipped back to Europe.

And that's it for this topic. And right here are the rest of the topic videos for unit 3.
