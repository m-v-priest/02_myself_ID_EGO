== 释义

So as European states 欧洲国家 like France, Prussia 普鲁士, Russia, and Austria *were sliding 滑；移动 headlong (ad.)头朝前，头向前地；轻率地 into* 一头扎进；急速陷入 absolutism 专制主义 during this period, there were two very （加强名词的语气）仅仅的，唯独的 significant exceptions 例外 to this trend 趋势, namely 即 the English and the Dutch.   +

And since we already talked about England's constitutionalism 立宪主义 in previous unit 3 videos, I reckon 认为 we ought to give this one to the Dutch. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So where did this contrarian 叛逆的；反对的;背道而驰者 Dutch experiment 尝试 in anti-absolutism 反专制主义 come from?  +
We should know that prior to 在……之前 1648, `主` all this territory 领土 right here `谓` was ruled by the Spanish Habsburgs 西班牙哈布斯堡王朝, and the Dutch were not real happy about that arrangement 安排. And so in the mid-16th century, the 80 Years' War 八十年战争 began (v.) with a Dutch revolt 起义 against their Habsburg ruler 统治者. By the end, that war kind of *got folded 折叠 into* 被折叠进;融入；并入 the 30 Years' War 三十年战争 which we considered in another video, and all of it was ended (v.) in the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约 signed in 1648.  +
As a result of that treaty 条约, the Dutch won (v.) their independence 独立 from the Spanish, and the Republic of _the United Provinces_ of the Netherlands 荷兰联省共和国 was born. Don't get confused 混淆 -- Netherlands 荷兰（国家） is the place, the Dutch 荷兰人 are the people. +

|战争双方
|威斯特伐利亚和约, 结束了神圣罗马帝国的三十年战争 （1618-1648 年）. *战争一方是哈布斯堡王朝 （奥地利和西班牙的统治者）及其天主教盟友; 另一方是与法国结盟的"新教"势力（瑞典和某些神圣罗马公国）*（尽管法国是天主教徒，但在路易十四国王的领导下强烈反对哈布斯堡王朝）。

欧洲在"三十年战争", 和重叠的"八十年战争" （始于 1568 年左右）中, 遭受重创. +
八十年战争: 是"新教徒"占多数的荷兰共和国 （现代尼德兰）在新教徒占多数的英国的支持下，为争取独立, 而与"天主教"占多数的西班牙和葡萄牙进行的长期斗争。 (*即: #新教徒荷兰+英国  ----- vs -----  天主教西班牙+葡萄牙#*) +
三十年战争: 是欧洲宗教战争中最惨重的一场，围绕神圣罗马帝国展开。

|条约内容
|威斯特伐利亚和约的主要原则是：

Ius reformandi was removed: *Subjects were no longer forced (v.) to follow the religion of their ruler.* Rulers were allowed to choose (v.) between Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism. +
改革权被废除：*臣民不再被强迫信奉其统治者的宗教。统治者可以在天主教、路德教和加尔文教之间进行选择。*

|条约意义
|一些国际关系学者认为，威斯特伐利亚和约, 是现代国际关系关键原则的起源，包括"边界不可侵犯," 和不干涉主权国家内政 。这一体系在文献中被称为"威斯特伐利亚主权" 。大多数现代历史学家都质疑这一体系与威斯特伐利亚和约之间的联系. **这些条约的正文中没有包含任何关于宗教自由、主权, 或权力平衡的内容，而这些内容可以被解释为国际法原则。 **  +
神圣罗马帝国的宪法安排, 是正文中唯一提到主权和宗教平等的背景，但在这种情况下，它们并不是新思想。

*虽然这些条约本身并不构成现代国家法律的基础，但它们确实象征着欧洲长期宗教冲突的结束。*

== 中文释义

**#在这一时期，当法国、普鲁士、俄罗斯和奥地利等欧洲国家一头扎进"专制主义"时，有两个非常重要的例外情况，那就是英国和荷兰。#**由于我们在之前第三单元的视频中, 已经讨论过**英国的"立宪主义"，**我觉得我们应该来聊聊荷兰。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

那么，荷兰这种"反对专制主义"的独特尝试, 是从何而来的呢？我们应该知道，**#在1648年之前，这片领土一直由西班牙"哈布斯堡王朝"（Spanish Habsburgs）统治，荷兰人对这种统治安排很不满意。#**于是在16世纪中期，八十年战争（80 Years' War）爆发，*荷兰人反抗"哈布斯堡王朝"的统治。最终，这场战争被卷入了"三十年战争"*（30 Years' War，我们在另一个视频中讨论过），**##所有这些战争, 以1648年签署的《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia）而告终。由于该条约，荷兰从西班牙手中赢得了独立，##荷兰联省共和国（Republic of the United Provinces of the Netherlands）诞生了。**别搞混了——“Netherlands”是指这个国家，“Dutch”指的是荷兰人。  +

很明显，*在长期受到"哈布斯堡王朝"的压迫后，##荷兰人对"君主制"心存反感，所以他们摒弃了"君主制政府"，转而支持"立宪政府"。但荷兰的"立宪主义"与英国的有所不同。英国倾向于"君主立宪制"，##在这种制度下，君主的权力受到"议会两院"权力的法治限制。另一方面，#荷兰完全没有为君主制做任何规定，而是选择了"共和制政府"，这意味着权力掌握在人民手中，政府通过人民代表来运作。#*  +

**在荷兰国内，有省级政府, 和联邦政府，**这大致可以和美国的政府作比较——美国有"州政府"和"联邦政府"。当然，两者也有很多不同之处，但这样的大致比较可能有助于你记忆。**#在荷兰，每个省都有自己的议会，称为"等级会议"（estate），省级"等级会议"掌握着大部分权力。每个省都由"寡头政治"（oligarchy）统治，寡头政治是一种由少数人统治的政府形式，与"由一个人统治的君主制"形成对比。寡头政治通常由富有的商人和乡村地主组成，他们处理该省的所有国内政策。#**此外，每个等级会议都会任命一位"执政"（stadholder），"执政"负责履行礼仪职责, 并承担军事防御责任。  +

*#权力远不及"等级会议"的联邦政府. 被称为"联省议会"（States General），它主要处理外交政策和战争事务。由于权力有限，所有重大问题都必须提交给"省级政府"，而每个省级政府都拥有否决权。这种政府结构对荷兰人来说非常成功，这就是为什么这个时期被称为荷兰的"(民主)黄金时代"（Dutch Golden Age）。他们的成功, 在很大程度上得益于当时荷兰是欧洲最富有的国家这一事实。#*  +

**荷兰在造船业上投入巨大，并且由于其在大西洋上的地理位置，他们能够利用不断发展的"大西洋贸易"带来的财富。更不用说他们在"印度洋贸易"中也占据了重要地位。所有这些加在一起, 意味着荷兰在当时拥有全欧洲乃至世界最高的生活水平。**这意味着当欧洲其他人还在为食物而骚乱时，荷兰人却能坐在餐桌前尽情享用美食。  +

So as European states like France, Prussia, Russia, and Austria were sliding headlong into absolutism during this period, there were two very significant exceptions to this trend, namely the English and the Dutch. And since we already talked about England's constitutionalism in previous unit 3 videos, I reckon we ought to give this one to the Dutch. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

So where did this contrarian Dutch experiment in anti-absolutism come from? We should know that prior to 1648, all this territory right here was ruled by the Spanish Habsburgs, and the Dutch were not real happy about that arrangement. And so in the mid-16th century, the 80 Years' War began with a Dutch revolt against their Habsburg ruler. By the end, that war kind of got folded into the 30 Years' War which we considered in another video, and all of it was ended in the Peace of Westphalia signed in 1648. As a result of that treaty, the Dutch won their independence from the Spanish, and the Republic of the United Provinces of the Netherlands was born. Don't get confused -- Netherlands is the place, the Dutch are the people.

Now clearly the Dutch had kind of a monarchy hangover after so long being trampled upon by the Habsburgs, and so they rejected a monarchical form of government in favor of a constitutional government. But the Dutch flavor of constitutionalism was different from England. England favored a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch was limited by the rule of law by the power of the two houses of Parliament. The Dutch, on the other hand, made precisely no provision for a monarch, and instead opted for a republican government, which means that the power was in the hands of the people, and the government did its work by means of the people's representatives.

Now within the Netherlands, there were provincial governments and there was a federal government, which you might roughly compare to our government here in the U.S. -- we have state governments and we have a federal government. There are also a lot of dissimilarities, but as a general comparison that might help you to remember. In the Netherlands, each province had its own assembly called an estate, and the provincial estates held most of the power. Each of these states was ruled by an oligarchy, which is a form of government in which a few people rule, as opposed to a monarchy in which one person ruled. Now the oligarchy was usually made up of wealthy businessmen and rural landowners, and they handled all the province's domestic policy. Furthermore, each estate appointed a stadholder who performed ceremonial duties and was responsible for military defense.

The federal government, which had a lot less power than the estates, was known as the States General, and it mostly handled foreign policy and war. And because it had so little power, every major issue had to be referred back to the provincial government, all of which had veto power. Now this governmental structure was exceedingly successful for the Dutch, which is why this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. And much of their success rested on the fact that they were about the wealthiest European state during that time.

The Dutch invested heavily in shipbuilding, and because of their geographical position on the Atlantic Ocean, they were able to exploit the riches of the growing Atlantic trade. Not to mention they made a significant footprint in the Indian Ocean trade as well. And all of that taken together meant that the Dutch had the highest standard of living in all of Europe, and arguably the world during this time. That meant that while everyone else in Europe was rioting over food, the Dutch sat at their tables and feasted heartily.
