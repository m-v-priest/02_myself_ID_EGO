== 释义

We've talked about everything in this unit except the rise of absolutist rulers 专制统治者 in the period 1648 to 1850. So let me put it this way 我这么来说吧: if the kings of the Middle Ages were like Charmander 小火龙, and `主` the new monarchs 君主 of the 16th and 17th centuries `系` were like Charmeleon 火恐龙, then the kings of this period are like the first edition shadowless  没有影子的 holographic 全息的；全部手写的 Charizard 喷火龙 -- which is to say that /since the beginning of this course (课程；过程；道路) 从这门课开始, monarchs continue to grow in power, and now we're going to talk about the high _water mark_ (水位标记) 最高点, namely absolutism 专制主义.  +

.案例
====
.*Credit* where credit is due  该表扬的就表扬; 功劳要给予真正值得的人,功劳归功于应得之人
这句话是​​省略形式​​，完整结构可理解为：
​"*Give credit* where credit is due."​​（在应得功劳的地方, 给予功劳） +
- "where"​​：引导状语从句，表示“在…的情况下/地方”。 +
- "credit is due"​​：被动语态（due = 应得的），直译“功劳是被应得的”。

类似结构的例句​​

- "*Give praise* where praise is deserved."（在值得表扬的地方给予表扬。）
- "*Honor* where honor is owed."（荣誉归于应得之人。）

为什么能省略动词？​​
英语谚语/口号常省略动词，使表达更简洁有力。类似例子：

- "*Safety* first."（安全第一。）→ 省略 "put"（Put safety first）。
- "*All’s fair* 公平的；合理的 in love and war."（爱情和战争不择手段。）→ 省略 "is"（All is fair...）。

.that Pokemon example came from O'Hara through the eras over on Tick Tock.
这个宝可梦的比喻, 来自TikTok上的‘O’Hara through the eras’（账号/系列）。 +
- O’Hara​人名（可能是历史博主、学者或内容创作者）。 +
- through the eras​​	“穿越时代”（指其内容涵盖不同历史时期）。 +
- over on Tick Tock​​	“在TikTok上”（*"over on" 强调平台转移，类似中文“在某某那边”*）。

Now let's start with a definition. Absolutism 专制主义 indicates (v.)表明，标示；象征，暗示 the process /by which political power 政治权力 *was transferred away* _from_ 从……转移 the nobility 贵族 and the church /and _toward_ the monarch 君主. And that way, *it was* the monarch *that* held most of the power in these absolute estates 专制国家.  +
Before I *introduce you to* several of these big cheese 干酪，奶酪;大人物，大亨（俚语，重要人物） kings and queens, let's talk about the factors that led to this new form of governance 治理形式. +

The first factor was the weakened (a.) influence 影响力减弱 of the Catholic Church 天主教会 *due to* _a growing acceptance and a tolerance_ of Protestant practice (新教活动) 越来越多的人接受和容忍新教的做法 and a lack of interest in religious warfare 宗教战争 after the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约.  +
The second factor *has to do with* 与……有关 economics 经济. As we've talked about in other videos, merchant classes 商人阶层 were expanding (v.) rapidly 迅速扩张 during this period of global trade 全球贸易, and they _in some measure_ 在某种程度上 desired (v.)渴望 absolute monarchs 专制君主 for the economic and political stability 经济和政治稳定 that they could provide (v.). +

Now `主` one of the main means 主要方式 by which _absolute monarchs_ consolidated (v.) their power 巩固权力 under themselves `系` was by weakening (v.) the nobility 削弱贵族.  +
Prior to 在……之前 this age, the noble class 贵族阶级 in many European states *held a lot of power*, and they did a lot of _the work of administration_ 行政管理工作 in the kingdom 王国.  +
But now, absolute monarchs are going to start (v.) *siphoning (v.)抽取；用虹吸管输送 that power away* 抽取权力 from the nobility /by creating _giant bureaucracies_ 庞大的官僚机构 that handle (v.) most of the administration of the kingdom.  +
And the big difference here is that /the bureaucrats 官僚 were *answerable (a.)向某人（对某事）负责;（为某事）承担责任，承担后果  directly to* 直接对……负责 the king, whereas （表示对比）但是，然而 the nobility was less 更少地，程度较低地  so. +

.siphon
(n.) a tube that is used for moving liquid from one container to another, using pressure from the atmosphere 虹吸管

image:/img/siphon.jpg[,15%]

1.to move a liquid from one container to another, using a siphon 用虹吸管吸（或抽） +
•I siphoned the gasoline out of the car into a can. 我用虹吸管把汽车里的汽油抽到桶里。 +
•The waste liquid needs to be siphoned off. 需要把废液抽走。 +

2.( informal ) to remove money from one place and move it to another, especially dishonestly or illegally （尤指私自或非法）抽走，转移（钱） +
SYN divert +
•She has been accused of *siphoning off* thousands of pounds *from* the company *into* her own bank account. 她被指控把公司的几千英镑转移到了自己的账户里。 +

-> 来自希腊语 siphon,管子，管道，引申词义吸管，虹吸。

Okay, now let's meet (v.) some of these absolutist monarchs 专制君主, and I reckon 认为 we ought to start (v.) in England with _James the First_ 詹姆斯一世.  +
You watched my video on the English Civil War 英国内战, you'll remember that _James the First_ was significantly influenced by the idea of _the divine (a.)神的，天赐的 right of kings_ 君权神授观念. This was the idea that a king had *been granted (v.) political authority* 政治权力 by God /and was thus answerable (a.) only to God -- not to the nobility, not to the people -- God alone.  +
And so James tried to act (v.) *in accordance with* 与……一致；按照……的规定或要求 his divine right /by spending money that was unapproved by Parliament 未经议会批准. But that presented (v.)展现；引起，带来 a problem in England _that won't be a problem_ in any other _attempt (n.) at absolutism_ 专制主义尝试.  +

In England, they had _the Magna Carta_ 大宪章 ratified (v.)批准 in 1215 which officially limited (v.) the power of the monarchy 君主权力. So Parliament *was* always *pushing back against* 反抗，抵制 James's attempts at absolutism.  +
So in the end, England *fought (v.) a civil war* to establish (v.) the limited power of the monarch, and so James the First's attempts (n.) at absolutism -- you know, they were a failure 失败. +

Now over 在（另一个地方） in Spain, absolutism reached (v.) its peak 达到顶峰 in Philip II 腓力二世 in the second half of the 16th century. Philip was able to unite (v.) the Iberian Peninsula 伊比利亚半岛 by capturing (v.)俘获，捕获；夺取，占领 Portugal 占领葡萄牙 /and repulse (v.) 击退 those pesky (a.)讨厌的，麻烦的 Ottomans 讨厌的奥斯曼人 in the Mediterranean 地中海.  +
But unfortunately for Philip, `主` the rebellion 叛乱 in the Spanish Netherlands 西属尼德兰 -- which we talked about in another video -- and the failure of the Spanish Armada 西班牙无敌舰队 to successfully invade (v.) England `谓` led to a decline of Spain's power 西班牙国力衰落 over the next century. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.pesky
-> 来自pest方言变体，-y,形容词后缀。即像害虫一样的，引申词义恼人的，讨厌的。

.Now over in Spain
这里的 ​​"over"​​ 是一个​​口语化的副词​​，主要起到​​空间转移（spatial transition）​​的作用，用于将讨论焦点从​​英格兰​​切换到​​西班牙​​。 +
​*"over"​​ 表示 ​​“在（另一个地方）”​​，强调从当前讨论的国家（英格兰）转向另一个国家（西班牙）。
类似中文的 ​​“而在西班牙那边……”​​ 或 ​​“再看西班牙这边……”*​

为什么用 "over" 而不用 "in"？​

- "in Spain"​​：仅表示“在西班牙”，没有对比或转移的意味。
- "over in Spain"​​：
​​隐含地理距离感​​（英格兰和西班牙是不同国家）。
​​暗示话题的对比​​（前文讲英格兰失败，后文讲西班牙成功）。

口语中更自然流畅，类似 ​​"now turning to..."​​ 或 ​​"now looking at..."​​。

But James and Philip were just the appetizers 开胃菜 of this magnificent (a.)宏伟的，壮丽的；令人印象深刻的，出色的 absolutist meal 一餐, and now we get to the main course 主菜.  +
If there was one monarch that had all the absolutist flavors 风味调料 *baked (v.)（在烤炉里）烘烤 in* 具备所有专制主义特征, it was our boy Louis XIV of France 法国的路易十四. In fact, Louie had a little catchphrase 名言；流行语;口号 that he was fond (a.) of using 喜欢用, namely "L'état, c'est moi," `主` which _when being translated_ `谓` means (v.) "I am the state 朕即国家."  +
In other words 换句话说, by Louie's reckoning (估计；估算；计算) 据路易的理解, the military is not the state, the nobility is not the state, the people are not the state -- *I*, with my _towering (a.)高耸的；卓越的 butt （武器或工具的）粗大的一端 cut_ 高耸的发型 and magnificent tights (紧身衣裤) 华丽的紧身衣, *am the state.* All power *belongs to* me. +

•a rifle butt 步枪的枪托

3.( BrE ) a large round container for storing or collecting liquids （盛液体的）大桶 +
•a water butt 集雨桶

4.( informal ) ( especially NAmE ) the part of the body that you sit on 屁股
====

Now `主` this "I am the state" business `谓` didn't *arise (v.)产生，出现；起源（于） out of thin air* 凭空出现. As a child, Louis was significantly impacted (v.)（对某事物）有影响，有作用 by the rebellion of the nobility and the commoners (平民) 贵族与平民的叛乱 that was known as the Fronde 投石党运动 that began in 1648.  +
Alarmed by the increasingly autocratic 独裁的，专制的；专横的 measures 专制措施 taken by France's chief minister 首席大臣 Cardinal (a.n.)红衣主教;最主要的，基本的 Mazarin 马扎然红衣主教, the judicial nobility 司法贵族 encouraged (v.)鼓励 commoners to riot (v.)煽动平民暴动.  +

And *long story short* 长话短说, the chaos 混乱 forced (v.) young Louis and his mother to flee (v.) Paris for safety 逃离巴黎避难. And while the violence *died down* 逐渐减弱或消失;平息 a few years later, Louis never forgot (v.) the humiliation 屈辱 of fleeing (v.) Paris _at the hands of_ 出自…之手;由某人的行动所导致的 the nobility and the chaotic (a.)混乱的，无秩序的 rabble 乌合之众；暴民；下层社会 of commoners 贵族和平民暴徒. +

投石党运动 （ 法语发音： [fʁɔ̃d] ⓘ ) 是 1648 年至 1653 年间法兰西王国发生的**一系列内战 ，**发生在 1635 年开始的法西战争期间。年轻**国王路易十四的政府面临着诸侯、贵族、贵族地区法院（ 高等法院 ）以及大部分法国民众的联合反对，**并成功制服了他们。*这场争端始于法国政府颁布了七项财政法令，其中六项旨在增加税收。 高等法院进行反抗，质疑国王行为的合宪性，并试图制衡他的权力。*

年轻的路易十四对投石党运动的经历印象深刻，于是他改组了法国作战部队，实行更严格的等级制度，国王可以任命或罢免军队领导人。投石党运动代表着法国贵族对抗国王的最后尝试，并以其屈辱告终。

.rabble
-> 可能来自拟声词，模仿喧闹声，吵闹声，-le,表反复。后用于形容没有组织的乌合之众。

Now *let's take a closer look at* how Louis XIV, once he *came of age* 成年后, *consolidated (v.) power* under himself 巩固权力.  +
The first way he did it `系` was _by means of_ 通过，借助于 the intendant 监督官；管理者；地方行政长官 system 监察官制度. Louis *sent* (v.) bureaucratic agents 官僚代理人 called intendants 监察官 *to* the various districts of France who *acted as* avatars （人或思想的）化身，体现 of Louis himself 路易的化身. And *as such* 因此，如此, whatever policies Louis passed (v.), his intendants would *make sure that* they were obeyed (v.) throughout France 确保在法国全境得到执行.  +
This undermined (v.) the authority of 削弱……的权威 local governors and authorities 当局，官方；官方机构 **to make sure** `主` all parts of Louie's kingdom `谓` *were made* to obey (v.) his will 服从他的意志. +

And `主` the second way Louis *consolidated power* under himself `系` was the construction of his magnificent 宏伟的，壮丽的；令人印象深刻的 Palace of Versailles 凡尔赛宫.  +
*He mandated (v.)授权；命令 that* the nobles live (v.) _at least_ part of the year within the walls of Versailles. And in that way, Louis was able *to keep his eye 监视 on* their behavior.  +
Additionally 此外, by establishing (v.) _an elaborate set_ of court rituals (典礼；宗教仪式；固定程序) 复杂的宫廷仪式, nobles began *to fight* (v.) amongst themselves *over* who would be closest to the king /and thus earn (v.) his favor 赢得他的青睐 *both* for themselves *and* the regions  地区；地域 they represented.

[.my2]
从而为自己和所代表的地区, 赢得国王的青睐。


And just for poops and giggles （俚语，开玩笑地）, the most coveted (a.)垂涎的；梦寐以求的 position 最令人垂涎的职位 -- I kid (v.)欺骗，哄骗 you not （俚语，不骗你） -- *was reserved for* the guy who *got to* _hand (v.) Louie his shirt_ 得以亲手递给路易（国王）他的衬衫 in the morning. And by *creating (v.) this kind of competition* among the nobility 在贵族中制造这种竞争, Louis was able to secure (v.) their loyalty and cooperation (n.合作，协作) 确保他们的忠诚与合作 and thus *consolidated (v.) more power* under himself. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.covet
(v.)[ VN] ( formal ) to want sth very much, especially sth that belongs to sb else 渴望；贪求（尤指别人的东西）；觊觎 +
-> 来自拉丁词cupio, 渴求，词源同Cupid, cupidity, hope.

.Got to hand Louie his shirt
"got to" = 被允许做、有机会做 +
"hand" = 亲手递给 +
"Louie" = 路易（Louis XIV，路易十四的昵称） +
"his shirt" = 他的衬衫 +
→ ​​“得以亲手递给路易国王他的衬衫”​ +
====

`主`  The third way Louis *consolidated power* under himself `系` was by imposing (v.) religious uniformity 强制实行宗教统一 throughout France. +
If you've been around since unit 2, you'll remember that /in France there were a growing number of Huguenots 胡格诺派 -- which is to say Protestant Calvinists 新教加尔文派 -- that caused a lot of trouble in France, none of which I'll rehash (v.)（稍微改动）重新推出；以新形式表达旧内容 here 在此不再赘述.  +

But Henry IV 亨利四世 *put in place* 实施 _the Edict 令；布告 of Nantes_ 南特敕令 which established _an almost unheard (a.未被听的；未听到的) 几乎闻所未闻的 of degree_ of religious tolerance 前所未有的宗教宽容 in France for the Protestant minority 新教少数派.  +
Louis XIV decided that /`主` (强调​​目的或结果) to have a state (n.) whose people did not all *conform (v.)遵守，符合；顺从  to* 符合 his own religious beliefs -- which is to say Catholicism 天主教 -- `系` *wasn't a good look* 体面的形象 for a man who desired (v.) absolute power 对于渴望绝对权力的人来说不是好事.  +
And therefore in 1685, Louis revoked 撤销,废除；使无效 the Edict of Nantes, removing (v.) protection for the Huguenots 胡格诺派. Hundreds of thousands of them *migrated (v.) to* more tolerant states 迁移到更宽容的国家, *robbing* (v.)抢劫；掠夺；盗取 France *of* _a healthy portion 部分 of_ their merchant class 使法国失去大量商人阶层. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.to have a state
"to have"​​ 强调​​目的或结果​​（他想要的是一个统一的天主教国家）。 +
他认为，拥有一个人民不完全遵从他宗教信仰的国家，对一个渴望绝对权力的人来说是不体面的。

.to have a state whose people did not all conform to his own religious beliefs — which is to say Catholicism — *wasn’t a good look* for a man who desired absolute power.

为什么不用 "having"？​​ +

- "to have"​​ 强调​​目的或结果​​（他想要的是一个统一的天主教国家）。
- 如果用 ​​"having"​​（动名词），会变成描述一种状态，但这里更侧重路易十四的​​主观判断和决策​​。

​​例句对比：​​ +
"He decided that *to allow dissent* was dangerous."​​
（他认为允许异议是危险的。）→ 强调他的判断。 +
"He decided that *allowing dissent* was dangerous."​​
语法正确，但弱化了“决定”的意味，更像客观陈述。

.rob
(v.)[ VN]~ sb/sth (of sth) : to steal money or property from a person or place 抢劫；掠夺；盗取 +
•to rob a bank 抢劫银行 +
•The tomb had been robbed of its treasures.这座坟墓里的财宝早已被盗。
====



And the fourth way Louis *consolidated power* `系` was through his endless wars of expansion 无休止的扩张战争. In order to finance (v.)为……提供资金 Louie's endless wars, his finance minister 财政部长 Jean-Baptiste Colbert 让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔 shaped (v.) the French economy *according to* 根据,依照 mercantilist policy 重商主义政策.  +
This had the effect of decreasing (v.)（使）减少，（使）降低 France's debt 减少法国债务, *it breathed (v.) new life 注入新活力,给…注入新的生命 into* domestic industries 国内产业, it expanded (v.) France's colonial holdings 扩大法国殖民地 and created (v.) a favorable balance of trade 贸易顺差.  Well done, Colbert.  +
But Louie's endless wars of French conquest 法国的征服战争 cost (v.) _a metric butt load 一公吨屁股的量 of_ money 花费巨额资金, and most of Colbert's work on this front 活动领域；阵线  was undone (a.)未完成；未竟 to finance (v.) them 为战争提供资金而前功尽弃. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.a metric butt load of money
这是一个​​幽默夸张的表达​​，用来强调​​“极其巨大的数量”

a metric butt load​​	“一公吨屁股的量”,	用荒诞的单位制造夸张效果 +
of money​​	“的钱”,	强调对象是金钱

​​"Butt"​​（屁股）是粗俗词，故意用低俗词汇制造反差幽默。 +
​​"Load"​​ 原指“装载量”（如卡车载重），但搭配 ​​"butt"​​ 后变成无意义的虚构单位。 +
​​"Metric"​​（公制的）是正经计量单位，与 ​​"butt"​​ 形成滑稽对比（类似“科学严谨地测量屁股”） +

.undone
(a.)
1.( especially of clothing尤指衣服 ) not fastened or tied 未扣；未系；松开 +
•Her blouse had come undone . 她的衬衫扣松开了。 +

2.( especially of work尤指工作 ) not finished 未完成；未竟 +
•Most of the work had been left undone. 大部分工作还没有做完。 +

3.( old use) ( of a person人 ) defeated and without any hope for the future 完蛋；一蹶不振；无出头之日 +
====


image:/img/Peter the Great 3.jpg[,100%]


And finally, let's *head (v.) over to* Russia /and see _how absolutism is taking shape 形成 over there_ under Peter the Great 彼得大帝.  +
Now by the time Peter became (v.) Tsar 沙皇 in 1682, Russia was still organized *according to* medieval standards 中世纪标准. `主` Other European nations in the west `谓` had adopted (v.) new technology and new methods of education and finance 教育和金融新方法, while Russia *lagged (v.)掉队，落后于 behind* 落后 with a sort of feudalistic society 封建主义社会.  +
And to Peter, that was about _as acceptable as_ a Russian man with a beard （幽默表达）. 对彼得来说，这就像一个留着胡子的俄罗斯男人一样难以接受。 That joke will *make more sense* in a minute, but trust me, it's hilarious （幽默表达）. +

[.my2]
最后，我们把目光转向俄罗斯，看看彼得大帝如何在那里推行绝对主义。1682年彼得即位时，俄罗斯仍停留在中世纪模式。西欧国家早已采用新技术、新教育和财政制度，而俄罗斯还滞留在封建社会中。对彼得来说，这种情况就像俄罗斯男人留胡子一样‘可接受’。（这个笑话稍后会解释，但相信我，它非常搞笑。）

[.my1]
.案例
====
.And to Peter, that was about _as acceptable as_ a Russian man with a beard.
对彼得来说，这种情况​​就像俄罗斯男人留胡子一样“可接受”​​。 +
​​实际含义​​：这句话是​​反讽​​（irony），表面说“可接受”，实则强调“​​完全不可接受​​”。 作者故意用 ​​"as acceptable as"​​ 达到反讽效果。

原句的 ​​"as acceptable as" + 负面例子​​ 结构，是英语中常见的​​讽刺表达​​，类似： +
"This plan is as solid as a house of cards."
（这计划像纸牌屋一样“稳固”→ 实际极不靠谱。） +
"He’s as honest as a used-car salesman."
（他像二手车销售员一样“诚实”→ 实际不可信。）

|个人理念
|**他认为俄罗斯人民粗鲁、愚昧、固执、懒惰，就像个孩子、懒惰的学生。他高度赞赏国家在社会生活中的作用，认为国家是实现崇高目标的理想工具，**是一个普遍的机构，**借助暴力和恐惧，将人民改造成受过教育、有意识、守法、对整个社会有用的人。 (#即必须用外界环境制度的强制力, 来对抗人性的懒惰和愚昧.#)**

*##他认为"政治家的道德"与"私人的道德"是不同的，他认为，君主为了国家利益可以不择手段，##使用暴力、伪造和欺骗。(#但这样会失去他国对你说话的信任#)*

|业绩
|彼得领导了一场文化革命，用现代、科学、 西化 、以激进启蒙运动为基础的制度, 取代了一些传统主义和中世纪的社会和政治制度。彼得大帝为俄罗斯的现代化建设做出了重要贡献，使其迅速跻身欧洲强国之列。

|夺取出海口
|**为了提升国家在海上的地位，彼得大帝寻求更多的  maritime outlets 海上出口。**当时，他唯一的出口是位于阿尔汉格尔斯克的白海 。**当时，波罗的海北部由瑞典控制，而黑海和里海则分别由南部的奥斯曼帝国和萨法维帝国控制。**由于争夺黑海和波罗的海出海口的战争爆发，国家对金属的需求加剧。

彼得大帝统治的大部分时间都花在了与奥斯曼帝国和瑞典帝国的长期战争中。俄罗斯吞并了波罗的海东海岸的大部分地区.

|建立St.Petersburg 圣彼得堡
|他在涅瓦河畔建立了圣彼得堡 ，这座城市被弗朗切斯科·阿尔加罗蒂称为“通往西方的窗口”。  1712 年，彼得将首都从莫斯科, 迁至圣彼得堡，并一直保留到 1918 年。

[.my2]
他实际上创造了一种时尚警察的形象，他们会在街上走着，剪掉男人的胡子，把男人的外套修剪成西方可以接受的长度.

This wasn't just for funsies 娱乐，消遣；恶作剧（俚语，好玩） -- according to the Russian Orthodox Church 俄罗斯东正教会, _an unshorn 未修剪过的 beard_ 未修剪的胡须 was a sign of piety 虔诚, and thus Peter was challenging (v.) the authority of the church 挑战教会权威 by requiring (v.) the shaving of beards . But don't worry -- if you wanted to keep your beard, then Peter established (v.) a beard tax 胡须税 that allowed anyone *to keep* their _lustrous (a.)有光泽的；光辉的 chin music_ **flowing （**幽默表达，保留胡须）. +

== 中文释义

在这个单元里，我们几乎谈论了所有内容，除了**1648年至1850年期间"专制统治者"的崛起。**所以让我这样说吧：*如果中世纪的国王就像小火龙（Charmander），16和17世纪的新君主就像火恐龙（Charmeleon），那么这个时期的国王, 就像第一版无阴影全息喷火龙*（Charizard）——也就是说，**#自从这门课程开始以来，君主的权力不断增长，现在我们要谈论的是权力的顶峰，也就是"专制主义"。#**嘿，该归功于谁就归功于谁——那个宝可梦（Pokemon）的例子来自TikTok上的奥哈拉（O'Hara）。这个例子太妙了。嘿，如果你想要这个视频以及我所有视频的配套笔记指南，链接在描述里。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

现在让我们从定义开始。**#"专制主义"指的是, 政治权力从贵族和教会手中, 转移到君主手中的过程。#**通过这种方式，**在这些"专制国家"里，君主掌握了大部分权力。**在我向你介绍几位重要的专制国王和女王之前，让我们谈谈导致这种新治理形式的因素。  +

第一个因素是，**由于对"新教"实践的接受和宽容不断增加，以及《威斯特伐利亚和约》之后人们对"宗教战争"缺乏兴趣，天主教会的影响力被削弱。**第二个因素与经济有关。正如我们在其他视频中谈到的，*在这个全球贸易时期，商人阶级迅速扩张，在某种程度上，他们渴望有专制君主，因为"专制君主"能带来经济和政治稳定。*  +

*#"专制君主"巩固自身权力的主要手段之一, 是削弱贵族的权力。在这个时代之前，许多欧洲国家的贵族阶级拥有很大权力，并且他们承担了王国的许多行政工作。但现在，专制君主开始通过建立庞大的官僚机构, 来处理王国的大部分行政事务，从而削弱贵族的权力 (中国在秦朝时就做到了这一点, 建立职业官僚体系)。这里的重大区别是，官僚们直接向国王负责，而贵族则并非如此。#*  +

好的，现在让我们认识一些专制君主，我认为我们应该从英国的詹姆斯一世（James the First）开始。如果你看过我关于英国内战的视频，你会记得詹姆斯一世深受"君权神授"思想的影响。**#"君权神授"的思想, 是指国王的政治权力由上帝授予，因此只向上帝负责——而不是向贵族或人民负责，只向上帝负责。#**所以**詹姆斯一世试图依据他的神授权力行事，花了一些未经议会批准的钱。**但这在英国引发了一个问题，而这个问题在其他专制尝试中不会出现。**#在英国，1215年批准的《大宪章》（Magna Carta）正式限制了君主的权力。所以议会一直在抵制詹姆斯一世的专制尝试。所以最终，英国爆发了内战，以确立君主的有限权力，#**因此詹姆斯一世的专制尝试失败了。  +

**在西班牙，16世纪后半叶，"专制主义"在菲利普二世（Philip II）时期达到了顶峰。**菲利普二世通过占领葡萄牙, 并击退地中海地区讨厌的奥斯曼人，成功统一了伊比利亚半岛（Iberian Peninsula）。但对菲利普二世来说不幸的是，西班牙尼德兰（Spanish Netherlands）的叛乱——我们在另一个视频中谈到过——以及**西班牙无敌舰队（Spanish Armada）入侵英国的失败，导致西班牙在下个世纪权力衰落。**  +

但是詹姆斯一世和菲利普二世, 只是这顿华丽专制大餐的开胃菜，现在我们要谈的是主菜。**如果说有一位君主完全体现了专制主义的特点，那就是法国的路易十四（Louis XIV）。**事实上，路易十四有一句他很喜欢用的口头禅，即“L'état, c'est moi”，翻译成中文就是“*朕即国家*”。换句话说，在路易十四看来，军队不是国家，贵族不是国家，人民不是国家——我，有着高耸的发型和华丽的紧身裤，我就是国家。所有权力都属于我。  +

这种“我即国家”的说法并非凭空产生。路易十四小时候，1648年开始的被称为“投石党运动”（Fronde）的贵族和平民叛乱, 对他产生了重大影响。法国首席大臣马扎然（Cardinal Mazarin）采取的日益专制的措施, 让司法贵族感到震惊，他们鼓动平民叛乱。长话短说，这场混乱, 迫使年轻的路易十四和他的母亲, 为了安全逃离巴黎。虽然几年后暴力事件平息了，但路易十四永远不会忘记被贵族和平民的混乱逼迫, 逃离巴黎的屈辱。  +

现在让我们仔细看看路易十四成年后, 是如何巩固自己的权力的。他采取的第一个方法, 是通过"总督制度"（intendant system）。**#路易十四派遣被称为总督（intendants）的官僚代理人, 到法国的各个地区，这些总督充当路易十四的化身。因此，无论路易十四通过什么政策，他的总督们都会确保这些政策在法国各地得到执行。这削弱了地方总督和当局的权力(有点类似于元朝的"行省"制度, 不信任地方官, 而是中央直接派人去地方管理)，#**以确保路易十四王国的各个部分, 都服从他的意志。  +

路易十四巩固自身权力的第二个方法, 是建造宏伟的凡尔赛宫（Palace of Versailles）。**他规定, 贵族每年至少有一部分时间, 要住在凡尔赛宫的围墙内 (这就和日本德川幕府统一天下后, 执行的"参勤交代"制度, 规定各藩的大名必需前往江户替幕府将军执行政务一段时间，然后返回自己领土执行政务。一年需要前往一次。之后改为3年一次, 1次为100日)。**通过这种方式，**路易十四能够监视他们的行为。**此外，通过建立一套精心设计的宫廷仪式，**贵族们开始相互争斗，争夺谁能最接近国王，**从而为自己和他们所代表的地区赢得国王的青睐。说真的，最令人垂涎的职位——我没开玩笑——是那个早上为路易十四递衬衫的人。通过在贵族之间制造这种竞争，路易十四能够确保他们的忠诚与合作，从而巩固了自己的权力。  +

路易十四巩固权力的第三个方法, 是在法国推行"宗教统一"。如果你从第二单元开始就在关注，你会记得在法国，胡格诺派（Huguenots，也就是"新教"加尔文主义者）的数量不断增加，这在法国引发了很多麻烦，这里我就不再赘述了。但**亨利四世（Henry IV）颁布了《南特敕令》（Edict of Nantes），在法国为"新教"少数派建立了一种几乎前所未有的"宗教宽容"程度。**路易十四认为，对于一个渴望绝对权力的人来说，一个人民不完全服从他宗教信仰（即天主教）的国家看起来不太好。因此，1683年，*路易十四废除了《南特敕令》，取消了对胡格诺派的保护。成千上万的胡格诺派迁移到更宽容的国家，法国的商人阶级也因此失去了很大一部分力量。*  +

路易十四巩固权力的第四个方法, 是进行无休止的扩张战争。为了给路易十四无休止的战争提供资金，他的财政大臣让 - 巴蒂斯特·科尔贝（Jean-Baptiste Colbert）根据"重商主义政策"塑造了法国经济。这一举措减少了法国的债务，为国内产业注入了新的活力，扩大了法国的殖民地，并创造了"贸易顺差"。科尔贝做得很好。但是**路易十四无休止的征服战争, 花费了大量的钱，**为了给这些战争提供资金，科尔贝在这方面的大部分努力都付诸东流了。  +

最后，让我们前往俄罗斯，看看在彼得大帝（Peter the Great）的统治下，专制主义是如何在那里形成的。1682年彼得成为沙皇（Tsar）时，俄罗斯仍然按照中世纪的标准组织。西方的其他欧洲国家已经采用了新的技术、新的教育和金融方法，而俄罗斯则在封建社会中落后了。对彼得来说，这就像一个留着胡子的俄罗斯人一样让人难以接受。这个笑话一会儿你就会明白，相信我，它很有趣。  +

不管怎样，*彼得前往一些西方国家，看看他们是如何做事的，回到家后他深信俄罗斯必须西化*，否则就会被西方国家超越。所以彼得决心改变俄罗斯的政治、文化和宗教机构。**在政治机构方面，彼得要求贵族在军队或民政管理部门服役。他建立了一系列贵族可以晋升的等级制度，**这意味着专家最终会处于高位——这对现代政府来说至关重要。此外，*这使得贵族们要向彼得大帝本人负责，这就是获取绝对权力的方式。*  +

在文化机构方面，彼得发现西欧没有男人留胡子，所以他要求贵族们刮掉胡子，穿上西式服装。他实际上创建了一种“时尚警察”，这些人会在街头走动，剪掉胡子，并把男人们的外套修剪到符合西方标准的长度。这不仅仅是为了好玩——**根据俄罗斯东正教会（Russian Orthodox Church）的说法，"不修剪的胡子"是虔诚的象征，因此彼得要求刮胡子是在挑战教会的权威。**但别担心——*如果你想保留胡子，彼得设立了"胡子税"，让任何想留胡子的人都可以继续留着他们漂亮的胡须。*  +

**在宗教机构方面，彼得重组了俄罗斯东正教会，取消了"牧首"（patriarch，类似于东正教的教皇）的角色，并用"神圣宗教会议"（Holy Synod）取而代之，彼得让那些听命于他的官员和牧师, 来管理"神圣宗教会议"。**为了实现这一切，彼得将税收增加了两倍，这意味着大多数农民都讨厌彼得的改革。然而，**彼得使俄罗斯西化的努力, 让这个国家融入了欧洲发展的主流。这一进程在他的继承人叶卡捷琳娜大帝（Catherine the Great）时期得以延续，**我们会在另一个视频中详细介绍她。  +

We've talked about everything in this unit except the rise of absolutist rulers in the period 1648 to 1850. So let me put it this way: if the kings of the Middle Ages were like Charmander, and the new monarchs of the 16th and 17th centuries were like Charmeleon, than the kings of this period are like the first edition shadowless holographic Charizard -- which is to say that since the beginning of this course, monarchs continue to grow in power, and now we're going to talk about the high water mark, namely absolutism. Hey, credit where credit is due -- that Pokemon example came from O'Hara through the eras over on Tick Tock. It's brilliant. Hey, if you want follow-along note guides for this video and all my videos, the link is in the description. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

Now let's start with a definition. Absolutism indicates the process by which political power was transferred away from the nobility and the church and toward the monarch. And that way, it was the monarch that held most of the power in these absolute estates. Before I introduce you to several of these big cheese kings and queens, let's talk about the factors that led to this new form of governance.

The first factor was the weakened influence of the Catholic Church due to a growing acceptance and a tolerance of Protestant practice and a lack of interest in religious warfare after the Peace of Westphalia. The second factor has to do with economics. As we've talked about in other videos, merchant classes were expanding rapidly during this period of global trade, and they in some measure desired absolute monarchs for the economic and political stability that they could provide.

Now one of the main means by which absolute monarchs consolidated their power under themselves was by weakening the nobility. Prior to this age, the noble class in many European states held a lot of power, and they did a lot of the work of administration in the kingdom. But now, absolute monarchs are going to start siphoning that power away from the nobility by creating giant bureaucracies that handle most of the administration of the kingdom. And the big difference here is that the bureaucrats were answerable directly to the king, whereas the nobility was less so.

Okay, now let's meet some of these absolutist monarchs, and I reckon we ought to start in England with James the First. You watched my video on the English Civil War, you'll remember that James the First was significantly influenced by the idea of the divine right of kings. This was the idea that a king had been granted political authority by God and was thus answerable only to God -- not to the nobility, not to the people -- God alone. And so James tried to act in accordance with his divine right by spending money that was unapproved by Parliament. But that presented a problem in England that won't be a problem in any other attempt at absolutism. In England, they had the Magna Carta ratified in 1215 which officially limited the power of the monarchy. So Parliament was always pushing back against James's attempts at absolutism. So in the end, England fought a civil war to establish the limited power of the monarch, and so James the First's attempts at absolutism -- you know, they were a failure.

Now over in Spain, absolutism reached its peak in Philip II in the second half of the 16th century. Philip was able to unite the Iberian Peninsula by capturing Portugal and repulse those pesky Ottomans in the Mediterranean. But unfortunately for Philip, the rebellion in the Spanish Netherlands -- which we talked about in another video -- and the failure of the Spanish Armada to successfully invade England led to a decline of Spain's power over the next century.

But James and Philip were just the appetizers of this magnificent absolutist meal, and now we get to the main course. If there was one monarch that had all the absolutist flavors baked in, it was our boy Louis XIV of France. In fact, Louie had a little catchphrase that he was fond of using, namely "L'état, c'est moi," which when being translated means "I am the state." In other words, by Louie's reckoning, the military is not the state, the nobility is not the state, the people are not the state -- I, with my towering butt cut and magnificent tights, am the state. All power belongs to me.

Now this "I am the state" business didn't arise out of thin air. As a child, Louis was significantly impacted by the rebellion of the nobility and the commoners that was known as the Fronde that began in 1648. Alarmed by the increasingly autocratic measures taken by France's chief minister Cardinal Mazarin, the judicial nobility encouraged commoners to riot. And long story short, the chaos forced young Louis and his mother to flee Paris for safety. And while the violence died down a few years later, Louis never forgot the humiliation of fleeing Paris at the hands of the nobility and the chaotic rabble of commoners.

Now let's take a closer look at how Louis XIV, once he came of age, consolidated power under himself. The first way he did it was by means of the intendant system. Louis sent bureaucratic agents called intendants to the various districts of France who acted as avatars of Louis himself. And as such, whatever policies Louis passed, his intendants would make sure that they were obeyed throughout France. This undermined the authority of local governors and authorities to make sure all parts of Louie's kingdom were made to obey his will.

And the second way Louis consolidated power under himself was the construction of his magnificent Palace of Versailles. He mandated that the nobles live at least part of the year within the walls of Versailles. And in that way, Louis was able to keep his eye on their behavior. Additionally, by establishing an elaborate set of court rituals, nobles began to fight amongst themselves over who would be closest to the king and thus earn his favor both for themselves and the regions they represented. And just for poops and giggles, the most coveted position -- I kid you not -- was reserved for the guy who got to hand Louie his shirt in the morning. And by creating this kind of competition among the nobility, Louis was able to secure their loyalty and cooperation and thus consolidated more power under himself.

The third way Louis consolidated power under himself was by imposing religious uniformity throughout France. If you've been around since unit 2, you'll remember that in France there were a growing number of Huguenots -- which is to say Protestant Calvinists -- that caused a lot of trouble in France, none of which I'll rehash here. But Henry IV put in place the Edict of Nantes which established an almost unheard of degree of religious tolerance in France for the Protestant minority. Louis XIV decided that to have a state whose people did not all conform to his own religious beliefs -- which is to say Catholicism -- wasn't a good look for a man who desired absolute power. And therefore in 1685, Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes, removing protection for the Huguenots. Hundreds of thousands of them migrated to more tolerant states, robbing France of a healthy portion of their merchant class.

And the fourth way Louis consolidated power was through his endless wars of expansion. In order to finance Louie's endless wars, his finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert shaped the French economy according to mercantilist policy. This had the effect of decreasing France's debt, it breathed new life into domestic industries, it expanded France's colonial holdings and created a favorable balance of trade. Well done, Colbert. But Louie's endless wars of French conquest cost a metric butt load of money, and most of Colbert's work on this front was undone to finance them.

And finally, let's head over to Russia and see how absolutism is taking shape over there under Peter the Great. Now by the time Peter became Tsar in 1682, Russia was still organized according to medieval standards. Other European nations in the west had adopted new technology and new methods of education and finance, while Russia lagged behind with a sort of feudalistic society. And to Peter, that was about as acceptable as a Russian man with a beard. That joke will make more sense in a minute, but trust me, it's hilarious.

Anyway, Peter went on a trip to some of these western nations to see how they did things and returned home convinced that Russia had to westernize or else be overtaken by the western nations. So Peter was determined to transform Russia's political, cultural and religious institutions. In terms of political institutions, Peter required nobles to serve in the army or civil administration. He created a series of ranks that nobles could move through which meant that experts ended up on top -- and this was essential to a modern government. Additionally, this made the nobility answerable to Peter himself, and that's how you get absolute power.

In terms of cultural institutions, Peter didn't see any men sporting beards over in Western Europe, so he required the nobility to shave their beards and wear western-style clothing. He actually created kind of like a fashion police who would walk around the streets cutting off beards and trimming men's coats to an acceptable western length. This wasn't just for funsies -- according to the Russian Orthodox Church, an unshorn beard was a sign of piety, and thus Peter was challenging the authority of the church by requiring the shaving of beards. But don't worry -- if you wanted to keep your beard, then Peter established a beard tax that allowed anyone to keep their lustrous chin music flowing.

In terms of religious institutions, Peter reorganized the Russian Orthodox Church by eliminating the role of patriarch -- which is kind of like the pope of the Orthodox church -- and he replaced it with the Holy Synod which Peter populated with officials and ministers who would do Peter's bidding. Now in order to pull all this off, Peter tripled taxes, and that meant most of the peasantry despised Peter's reforms. However, Peter's work to westernize Russia brought the nation into the mainstream of European development. That process was continued through his heir Catherine the Great, on whom more in another video.
