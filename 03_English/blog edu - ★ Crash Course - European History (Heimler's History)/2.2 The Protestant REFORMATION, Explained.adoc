== 释义

Okay, we're gonna talk about the Protestant Reformation 新教改革, but first the contest 竞赛 (但首先来一场问答比赛).  +
This is the papal palace 教皇宫殿 in Avignon 阿维尼翁, France, and that's weird. Who can tell me why that's weird? Yes, Carl in the back of the room, say it like you mean it. "Don't all the popes 教皇 live in Italy?" *On the nose* (正中鼻子上)准确无误,准确地, Carl. On the nose.  +
So if all the popes have always lived in the Vatican 梵蒂冈 in Rome, why is there a papal palace in France? And can you taste that sauce? Well, if you can, there's time to get that brain cow's milked. Let's get to it. +

I'm not going to give you a bunch of names and places you don't need to know for your exam, so let me just talk _in generalities_ (概述) 泛泛而谈 for this contextualization 背景介绍 piece.  +
In the High Middle Ages 中世纪盛期, there was a series of bitter 激烈的 and ongoing 持续的 disputes 争端 between Roman Catholic popes and European kings, especially the king of France.  +
So in 1309, the king of France pressured (v.)施压 the new pope to establish (v.) the #papacy 教皇职位；教皇权力# in Avignon and away from Italy.  +
`主` The series of popes who lived in Avignon `系` were all kinds of #nasty 极差的；令人厌恶的；令人不悦的;恶劣的#, ① *focusing* (v.) almost none *on* the spiritual well-being 精神福祉 of the church /and all *on* consolidating (v.) power 巩固权力 and wealth /② and *satisfying* (v.) their, uh, #urges 冲动；迫切的要求;欲望#. +

====

Now eventually, the seat of the #papacy 教皇的职位（或权力）;（某教皇）任职的时期#  *moved (v.) back to* Italy in 1377 /under the leadership of a new pope /who was all about 一心想要 *making sure that* such a violation 违背；侵犯 never happened again. He was pretty intense (a.)强烈感情（或意见、想法）的；尖锐的；热切的;坚决的 about it, and that *led to* a lot of fighting.  +
And so back in France, they just elected (v.) another pope to rule (v.) from Avignon. So if you're keeping track 跟踪,记录；关注 at home, in 1377, the Catholic Church in Europe was dominated by two rival popes 对立的教皇 who both claimed (v.) absolute power 绝对权力. This situation lasted (v.) for almost 40 years. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.if you’re keeping track at home
​"keeping track"​​ = 记录、跟进（某事的进展） +
​​"at home"​​ = 字面意思是“在家”，但在这里泛指 ​​“正在听/看的人”​​（比如听众、观众、读者）。 +
字面直译：​​“如果你在家（听/看的时候）一直在跟进（这段历史）……”​ +
====

And so going into the 16th century, the average European 欧洲人的普通人 thought (v.) the church was corrupt 腐败的 and hopelessly flawed (a.)存在严重缺陷的. People *had the general sense* that popes were more interested in consolidating (v.) power *than* guiding (v.) the lives of the faithful (a.n.)信徒. And you know, they were.  +
So by the 1500s, the Catholic Church had gotten *tangled 使缠结；纠结；乱作一团 up in* 卷入 political matters, and it accumulated 积累 a lot of wealth /and *engaged in* 参与 some corrupt practices 腐败行为. +

One of those corrupt practices was simony (n.)买卖圣职, which was _the buying and selling_ of church offices 教会职位.  +
Okay, we've got a bishop position 主教职位 open, so who's _the most spiritually qualified 精神上合格的 priest_ we can find?  Well, my uncle Cletus is about _**as** immoral 不道德的 **as they come**_ 达到某类事物或人的最高程度, but he does have a hankering (n.)渴望；向往 to wear (v.) one of them funny hats, and so he's prepared (v.) to offer (v.) you this much for the office. Well, I'm sure /your uncle Cletus will make a fine bishop. +

[.my1]

."as... as they come"​​
这是一个固定句型，*表示 ​​“达到某类事物或人的最高程度”​​。* +

类似结构： +
"as stubborn as they come"（固执到极点） +
"as cheap as they come"（吝啬到极致） +
​​"immoral"（不道德的）​​ +

这里特指 ​​“道德败坏、品行恶劣”​​（比如贪婪、腐败、渎职等）。 我叔叔Cletus简直是坏得不能再坏了 +


====

But for sure, `主` _the main corrupt practice_ you need to know in the context of the Reformation `系` is _the buying and selling_ of indulgences 赎罪券.  +
Now back in the 12th century, the church developed (v.) the doctrine of purgatory (炼狱；涤罪；暂时的苦难) 炼狱教义, which said that /after death, you went to *neither* heaven *nor* to hell /but to a kind of middle space called purgatory. Here, the soul 灵魂 was to be purified (v.)净化 before it entered heaven, and *depending on* how much of a turd 粪块；粪球;臭狗屎（对不喜欢的人的冒犯语）（俚语，可理解为“坏人”） you were in life, you could spend (v.) longer or shorter in that place. And you know, it wasn't a pleasant place to be. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.purgatory
在基督教中， "炼狱"是指肉体死亡后的一个过渡状态 ，用于净化或涤荡灵魂。只为他们留下“进入天堂喜乐所必需的圣洁”.  +
在艺术作品中，它被描绘成对未悔改的小罪和不完美的忏悔 （烈火炼狱）的一种令人不快的（自愿的，但并非可选的）“惩罚”. +

“炼狱”（purgatory）一词，在历史上和现代，*泛指各种死后痛苦，但不包括永恒的诅咒。*  英语使用者也用该词, 类比地**指任何遭受痛苦或折磨的场所或状态，尤指暂时的痛苦或折磨。**
====

So early in the 16th century, _Pope Leo the 10th_ offered (v.) Catholics indulgences 赎罪券 for purchase (n.) to finance (v.)资助 the completion of Saint Peter's Basilica 圣彼得大教堂. And the deal was, the more you spent (v.) on indulgences, the less time you spent (v.) in purgatory.  +
 Now prior to this, *confession 忏悔 was required* (v.) for the remission 缓解；宽恕；豁免  of sin 罪的赦免, but now if you bought (v.) an indulgence, you could effectively 实际上 have _a sin forgiven_ without ever confessing (v.)忏悔,供认 it. +

Now while all this was going on, an Augustinian monk 奥古斯丁修道士 by the name of Martin Luther 马丁·路德 was right in the struggle bus （俚语，处于困境）. Though he was fastidious (a.)挑剔的；；苛求的，难取悦的;一丝不苟的 about _making confession_ 坦白；忏悔 /and doing his works of penance 苦修, `主` his anxieties 焦虑 concerning (v.)关于，涉及  personal sin 个人的罪 `谓` would not leave (v.) him in peace.  +
But around 1515, a revolution （思想、工作方式等的）彻底变革；（使用武力、暴力的）革命；旋转 occurred (v.) in his thinking /as he was studying the New Testament (证明，证据；遗嘱，遗言；（人与上帝间的）圣约)新约圣经, specifically Romans chapter 1 罗马书第一章.  +

Additionally 此外, he came to see that /even `主` salvation 救赎 itself `系` was a gift of grace 恩典的礼物 /and not a reward for _good works_ 善行的回报. +

当这一切都在进行的时候，一个叫马丁·路德的奥古斯丁修道士, 就在斗争巴士上。虽然他对忏悔和忏悔的工作很挑剔，但他对个人罪恶的焦虑, 并没有让他平静下来。但在1515年左右，他的思想发生了革命性的变化. 当他正在研究新约，特别是罗马书第一章, 他发现，不是忏悔的行为使罪人得到宽恕，而是上帝根据基督完成的工作, 免费宽恕了罪。此外，他也认识到, 救恩本身是恩典的恩赐，而不是对善行的奖赏。

And from there, `主` the reformations 改革（复数形式） in his thoughts `谓` just kept coming. *The further* he studied the Bible, *the more* he saw the conflict with the Catholic Church.  +
He began to hold to 坚持 _the priesthood （总称教会或国家的）全体教士 of all_ believers (信徒；相信的人) 属于所有信徒的祭司职位,所有信徒皆为祭司, which challenged _the entrenched 根深蒂固的，不容易改的 Catholic dogma_ (教条，信条，教义) 天主教教义 of the priesthood of only a few believers.  +
And because the papacy 罗马教皇职位 and the priesthood had been severely demoted (v.)贬低 in many people's estimation 评价 /*thanks to* all the conflicts I mentioned before, this idea of _the priesthood of all believers_ would later become very attractive. +

.treatise

====

And in that treatise 论述；论文；专著, we can see an emphasis on two of Calvin's major innovations 创新 on doctrine.  +
First was _the doctrine of predestination_ (命运；预先注定；宿命论，得救预定论) 预定论, which taught (v.) that /God *had* from before the foundation of the world *decided* (v.) who would be saved /and who would *get all crispy （食物的外皮）松脆的 in hell* （俚语，在地狱受煎熬）.
Therefore 因此，所以, salvation 解救物，救星；解救，拯救；（基督教中）对灵魂的拯救，救赎 and damnation 诅咒；永罚 was *not* a matter of human choice 是人类选择的问题 *but* of God's choice.  +
`主` The second doctrine he formulated 规划；用公式表示；明确地表达 `系` was _the doctrine of the elect_ 选民教义, which is related (a.) to predestination 命运；预先注定；宿命论，得救预定论.
The elect 选民 were those _whom God had chosen to save_, and `主` those _who were truly elect_ `谓` *had no choice* in the matter /and further 更远地，再往前地；进一步；此外，而且 *could never lose (v.) their salvation.* +

[.my2]
在那篇论文中，我们可以看到加尔文对教义的两个主要创新的强调。 +
首先是"宿命论"，它教导说，上帝在创世之前, 就决定了谁会得救，谁会在地狱里被烤得酥脆。因此，救赎和诅咒不是人的选择，而是神的选择。 +
他提出的第二个教义是"选民的教义"，这与"预定论"有关。选民是神拣选来拯救的人，那些真正被拣选的人, 在这件事上没有选择，而且永远不会失去他们的拯救。

Now Calvin's Geneva 日内瓦 was essentially 本质上，根本上；大体上，基本上 run (v.) as a theocracy 神权政治, which is to say that /the Bible was the rule of law 法律准则 in that city.  +
And not surprisingly, that had some upsides 优点 /and it had some downsides 缺点.  +
The upside was that /Calvin *taught (v.) that* financial wealth 财富 was the _proper reward_ for hard work, and so that /*as long as* the elect didn't allow (v.) money to become their god, then `主` the accumulation 积累，堆积 of wealth `谓` could *be seen as* a sign of God's favor 上帝的眷顾.  +
And since *this was going on* in the context of _the economic shift_ 经济转变 in Europe into the Atlantic states, `主` places like Geneva and Amsterdam `谓` grew wealthy *with the support of* such doctrines. +

But the downside is that /if you disagreed with Calvin, you know, he'd *have you burned* (v.) at the stake (桩，标桩,火刑柱) 处以火刑, like he did Michael Servetus 迈克尔·塞尔维特 who disagreed with Calvin on baptism 洗礼.
So that's funny.  +

And then there was _an even further splintering_ 分裂,（使）裂成碎片 of Protestantism 新教 _with_ the rise of the Anabaptists 再洗礼派. They *believed in* the Reformation principles 宗教改革的原则 that Luther and Calvin did, but they separated (v.) from them _on the question of_ baptism 洗礼；严峻考验. And that's a recipe （导致某情况的）因素, as we've already seen, for John Calvin to burn (v.) your crap 质量差的东西；蹩脚货;废话；胡说；胡扯. +

`主` The main beef <美，非正式>犯罪指控，罪名（俚语，主要抱怨） *the Anabaptists  再洗礼派 had* about baptism `系` was that *they believed that* only adults should be baptized (v.)施洗礼 and not infants 婴儿, *on account of* 由于，因为 only adults *could profess (v.)宣称 that* they had faith (n.) and infants could not. +

== 中文释义

好的，我们即将讨论新"教改革"，但首先来看一个问题。这是位于法国阿维尼翁（Avignon, France）的教皇宫殿，这有点奇怪。谁能告诉我这奇怪在哪里呢？是的，坐在教室后面的卡尔，理直气壮地说出来。“难道不是所有的教皇都住在意大利吗？” 说得对，卡尔，说得对。那么，如果所有的教皇一直都住在罗马的梵蒂冈（Vatican in Rome），为什么在法国会有一座教皇宫殿呢？你能理解这其中的缘由吗？嗯，如果你能理解，那就说明你已经准备好获取知识了。我们开始吧。  +

我不会告诉你一堆你考试不需要知道的人名和地名，所以对于这个背景介绍，我就大概讲讲。**在中世纪盛期（High Middle Ages），罗马天主教教皇（Roman Catholic popes）和欧洲各国国王，尤其是法国国王之间，存在一系列激烈且持续的争端。**所以在1309年，法国国王施压, 让新教皇把教皇职位设立在阿维尼翁，而不是在意大利。住在阿维尼翁的这一系列教皇都很糟糕，他们几乎不关注教会的精神福祉，而是一心巩固权力、聚敛财富并满足自己的欲望。  +

最终，在1377年，在一位新教皇的领导下，教皇的座位又迁回了意大利。这位新教皇一心确保这样的违规行为不再发生。他对此非常坚决，这引发了很多争斗。所以在法国，他们又选出了另一位在阿维尼翁统治的教皇。所以，如果你在关注这件事，在1377年，欧洲的天主教会（Catholic Church）被两位相互竞争的教皇统治着，他们都声称拥有绝对权力。这种情况持续了将近40年。  +

所以**到了16世纪，普通的欧洲人认为教会腐败，**而且存在严重缺陷。人们普遍觉得教皇对巩固权力的兴趣, 比对引导信徒的生活更大。而且，事实确实如此。所以在16世纪，天主教会卷入了政治事务，积累了大量财富，并参与了一些腐败行为。  +

其中**一种腐败行为是"买卖神职"（simony），也就是买卖教会职位。**好的，有一个主教职位（bishop position）空缺了，那么我们能找到的最具精神资质的牧师是谁呢？嗯，我的叔叔克莱图斯（Cletus）品行恶劣，但他很想戴上那顶滑稽的帽子，所以他准备为这个职位付出代价。嗯，我相信你的叔叔克莱图斯会成为一名 “出色” 的主教。  +

但可以肯定的是，在宗教改革（Reformation）的背景下，你需要知道的主要腐败行为是**买卖赎罪券（indulgences）。**回到**12世纪，##教会发展出了"炼狱"（purgatory）的教义，教义说人死后，既不会上天堂也不会下地狱，而是会去一个叫做炼狱的中间地带。在那里，灵魂在进入天堂之前要得到净化，##而且根据你生前的恶劣程度，你在炼狱里待的时间有长有短。**而且，那可不是个让人愉快的地方。  +

所以在16世纪早期，教皇利奥十世（Pope Leo the 10th）向天主教徒提供"赎罪券"以供购买，目的是为圣彼得大教堂（Saint Peter's Basilica）的完工筹集资金。*规则是，你在"赎罪券"上花的钱越多，你在炼狱里待的时间就越短。在此之前，要想赎罪,就必须忏悔，但现在如果你购买"赎罪券"，你可以在不忏悔的情况下,有效地让自己的罪过得到赦免。*  +

就在这一切发生的时候，一位名叫**马丁·路德**（Martin Luther）的奥古斯丁修道士（Augustinian monk）陷入了挣扎。虽然他对忏悔和进行苦修非常严谨，但他对个人罪过的焦虑, 让他不得安宁。但在1515年左右，当他研读《新约》（New Testament），特别是《罗马书》（Romans）第一章时，*他的思想发生了一场革命。他发现，让罪人得到赦免的, 不是苦修行为，而是上帝基于基督已完成的工作, 免费给予的宽恕。此外，他开始明白，就连救赎本身也是上帝恩典的礼物，而不是对善行的奖赏。*  +

从那时起，他思想中的改革不断涌现。**他对《圣经》研究得越深入，就越能看到与天主教会的冲突。##他开始坚持"所有信徒皆为祭司"（priesthood of all believers）的观点，##这挑战了根深蒂固的天主教教义，即只有少数信徒能成为祭司。**而且由于我之前提到的所有冲突，*教皇职位和祭司职位, 在许多人眼中的地位大幅下降，所以"所有信徒皆为祭司"的观点(王侯将相, 宁有种乎? 人人皆可当总统), 后来变得非常有吸引力。*  +

**路德还开始形成一个后来成为"宗教改革"（Reformation）信条的观点，即"#唯独圣经"（sola scriptura），意思是只有《圣经》才是最终权威，而不是教皇的教义。(相当于圣经哲学不能再被新思想所发展了, 困成了一潭死水.)#**所以，他在修道士的头脑中形成了这些想法后，撰写了一份名为《九十五条论纲》（95 Theses）的文件，详细阐述了他对天主教会的不满。传说中，他把这些论纲钉在了维滕贝格（Wittenberg）教堂的门上。  +

他用拉丁语（Latin）撰写这些论纲，这意味着他原本只是想在一些受过教育的修道士和牧师中引发讨论。但**由于印刷术（printing press）的出现，《九十五条论纲》迅速在神圣罗马帝国（Holy Roman Empire）的德意志诸邦传播开来，他很快就找到了一群热切的听众，因为显然许多其他德国人对天主教会的弊端也有同感。**  +

一旦路德的抱怨, 和对教义的新解释, 传到教会官员那里，他们正式谴责他为异教徒（heretic）。他们把他传唤到沃尔姆斯帝国议会（imperial Diet of Worms），要求他撤回自己的作品。据说他回应道：“除非我被《圣经》和明确的理由所说服，否则我的良心被上帝的话语所束缚。我不能也不会撤回任何东西，因为违背良心既不正确也不安全。愿上帝帮助我。阿门。”  +

当路德发展他的思想, 并在沃尔姆斯议会后躲藏起来的时候，"新教改革"（Protestant Reformation）开始迅速传播，宗教改革中的下一个重要人物, 是我们所说的**约翰·加尔文**（John Calvin）。他是瑞士日内瓦（Geneva, Switzerland）的一名牧师，**他对"宗教改革"最重大的贡献之一, 是将"新教教义"系统化，**他在一本名为《基督教要义》（The Institutes of the Christian Religion）的长篇论述中做到了这一点。  +

在那本论述中，我们可以看到**加尔文对教义的两大创新的强调。首先是"预定论"（doctrine of predestination），它教导说, 上帝在世界创立之前就决定了谁会得救，谁会在地狱中遭受磨难。因此，救赎和诅咒不是人类选择的问题，而是上帝的选择(#即否定了人的主观能动性, 变成了"命定论"#)。 +
他提出的第二个教义是"选民论"（doctrine of the elect），这与"预定论"有关。选民是指那些被上帝选中得救的人，真正的选民在这件事上没有选择，而且永远不会失去他们的救赎 (#又是"命定论", 相当于"血统论"的变种. 有人天生就能得救, 有人无论他做什么都不会得救#)。**  +

加尔文统治下的日内瓦, 本质上是一个**神权政治（theocracy），也就是说，《圣经》是这个城市的法律。**毫不奇怪，这有好处也有坏处。**好处是加尔文教导说，经济财富是努力工作的合理回报，所以只要选民"不让金钱成为他们的上帝"，那么财富的积累就可以被视为上帝的青睐。**而且由于欧洲的经济重心向"大西洋沿岸国家"转移，像日内瓦和阿姆斯特丹（Amsterdam）这样的地方, 在这样的教义支持下变得富有。  +

**但坏处是，如果你不同意加尔文的观点，他会把你绑在火刑柱上烧死，**就像他对待在洗礼问题上与他意见不合的迈克尔·塞尔维特（Michael Servetus）那样。所以这很荒唐。而且**随着"再洗礼派"（Anabaptists）的兴起，"新教"进一步分裂。**他们相信路德和加尔文的"宗教改革"原则，但在洗礼（baptism）问题上与他们分道扬镳。正如我们已经看到的，这就像是给自己招来约翰·加尔文的惩罚。  +

"再洗礼派"在洗礼问题上的主要观点是，他们认为只有成年人应该接受洗礼，而不是婴儿，因为只有成年人能够宣称自己有信仰，而婴儿不能。  +

Okay, we're gonna talk about the Protestant Reformation, but first the contest. This is the papal palace in Avignon, France, and that's weird. Who can tell me why that's weird? Yes, Carl in the back of the room, say it like you mean it. "Don't all the popes live in Italy?" On the nose, Carl. On the nose. So if all the popes have always lived in the Vatican in Rome, why is there a papal palace in France? And can you taste that sauce? Well, if you can, there's time to get that brain cow's milked. Let's get to it.

I'm not going to give you a bunch of names and places you don't need to know for your exam, so let me just talk in generalities for this contextualization piece. In the High Middle Ages, there was a series of bitter and ongoing disputes between Roman Catholic popes and European kings, especially the king of France. So in 1309, the king of France pressured the new pope to establish the papacy in Avignon and away from Italy. The series of popes who lived in Avignon were all kinds of nasty, focusing almost none on the spiritual well-being of the church and all on consolidating power and wealth and satisfying their, uh, urges.

Now eventually, the seat of the papacy moved back to Italy in 1377 under the leadership of a new pope who was all about making sure that such a violation never happened again. He was pretty intense about it, and that led to a lot of fighting. And so back in France, they just elected another pope to rule from Avignon. So if you're keeping track at home, in 1377, the Catholic Church in Europe was dominated by two rival popes who both claimed absolute power. This situation lasted for almost 40 years.

And so going into the 16th century, the average European thought the church was corrupt and hopelessly flawed. People had the general sense that popes were more interested in consolidating power than guiding the lives of the faithful. And you know, they were. So by the 1500s, the Catholic Church had gotten tangled up in political matters, and it accumulated a lot of wealth and engaged in some corrupt practices.

One of those corrupt practices was simony, which was the buying and selling of church offices. Okay, we've got a bishop position open, so who's the most spiritually qualified priest we can find? Well, my uncle Cletus is about as immoral as they come, but he does have a hankering to wear one of them funny hats, and so he's prepared to offer you this much for the office. Well, I'm sure your uncle Cletus will make a fine bishop.

But for sure, the main corrupt practice you need to know in the context of the Reformation is the buying and selling of indulgences. Now back in the 12th century, the church developed the doctrine of purgatory, which said that after death, you went to neither heaven nor to hell but to a kind of middle space called purgatory. Here, the soul was to be purified before it entered heaven, and depending on how much of a turd you were in life, you could spend longer or shorter in that place. And you know, it wasn't a pleasant place to be.

So early in the 16th century, Pope Leo the 10th offered Catholics indulgences for purchase to finance the completion of Saint Peter's Basilica. And the deal was, the more you spent on indulgences, the less time you spent in purgatory. Now prior to this, confession was required for the remission of sin, but now if you bought an indulgence, you could effectively have a sin forgiven without ever confessing it.

Now while all this was going on, an Augustinian monk by the name of Martin Luther was right in the struggle bus. Though he was fastidious about making confession and doing his works of penance, his anxieties concerning personal sin would not leave him in peace. But around 1515, a revolution occurred in his thinking as he was studying the New Testament, specifically Romans chapter 1. He discovered that it was not acts of penance which rendered forgiveness to the sinner but rather God forgave sins for free based on the finished work of Christ. Additionally, he came to see that even salvation itself was a gift of grace and not a reward for good works.

And from there, the reformations in his thoughts just kept coming. The further he studied the Bible, the more he saw the conflict with the Catholic Church. He began to hold to the priesthood of all believers, which challenged the entrenched Catholic dogma of the priesthood of only a few believers. And because the papacy and the priesthood had been severely demoted in many people's estimation thanks to all the conflicts I mentioned before, this idea of the priesthood of all believers would later become very attractive.

Luther also began to formulate an idea that would later be a tenet of the Reformation, namely sola scriptura, which means scripture alone. The idea here is that the final authority for Christians was the Bible and not the papal dogma. So with all this swirling around in his monkish mind, he composed a document called the 95 Theses, which outlined in detail his complaints against the Catholic Church. And as legend has it, he nailed them to the Wittenberg church door.

Now the fact that he wrote these theses in Latin meant that he was interested in sparking a discussion among a few educated monks and priests. But because of the printing press, the 95 Theses were spread throughout the German states of the Holy Roman Empire with great speed, and he quickly found an eager audience because apparently many other Germans felt the same way about the Catholic Church's abuses.

Now once Luther's complaints and new interpretations of doctrines made it to the church officials, they officially denounced him as a heretic. They called him to stand before the imperial Diet of Worms and demanded that he recant his writings, to which he reportedly said, "Unless I am convinced by scripture and plain reason, my conscience is captive to the word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. God help me. Amen."

Now while Luther was developing his ideas and hiding after the Diet of Worms, the Protestant Reformation began to spread rapidly, and the next most significant player in the Reformation was our boy John Calvin. He was a minister in Geneva, Switzerland, and one of his most significant contributions to the Reformation was to systematize Protestant doctrine, which he did in a lengthy treatise known as The Institutes of the Christian Religion.

And in that treatise, we can see an emphasis on two of Calvin's major innovations on doctrine. First was the doctrine of predestination, which taught that God had from before the foundation of the world decided who would be saved and who would get all crispy in hell. Therefore, salvation and damnation was not a matter of human choice but of God's choice. The second doctrine he formulated was the doctrine of the elect, which is related to predestination. The elect were those whom God had chosen to save, and those who were truly elect had no choice in the matter and further could never lose their salvation.

Now Calvin's Geneva was essentially run as a theocracy, which is to say that the Bible was the rule of law in that city. And not surprisingly, that had some upsides and it had some downsides. The upside was that Calvin taught that financial wealth was the proper reward for hard work, and so that as long as the elect didn't allow money to become their god, then the accumulation of wealth could be seen as a sign of God's favor. And since this was going on in the context of the economic shift in Europe into the Atlantic states, places like Geneva and Amsterdam grew wealthy with the support of such doctrines.

But the downside is that if you disagreed with Calvin, you know, he'd have you burned at the stake, like he did Michael Servetus who disagreed with Calvin on baptism. So that's funny. And then there was an even further splintering of Protestantism with the rise of the Anabaptists. They believed in the Reformation principles that Luther and Calvin did, but they separated from them on the question of baptism. And that's a recipe, as we've already seen, for John Calvin to burn your crap.

The main beef the Anabaptists had about baptism was that they believed that only adults should be baptized and not infants, on account of only adults could profess that they had faith and infants could not.
