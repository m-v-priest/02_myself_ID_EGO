== 释义

Okay, here at the beginning of Unit 5 of AP Euro, we're talking about the rise of global markets 市场 and all the competition 竞争；角逐 that caused between European states 国家. But don't worry, it wouldn't be _true European economic 经济的 competition_ /if it didn't also lead to war and massive 巨大的；大量的 amounts of killing. Ah, I knew that you would be. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

And you know, when we talked about the European Age of Exploration 探索；勘探 and how, due to 由于，因为 the Columbian Exchange and the development of the Triangular Trade, economic competition between European states began to increase. And in that unit, we really focused on European states' efforts in the Americas. But while all that *was going on*, there was a growing competition in the Indian Ocean trade 贸易 as well. +

Hey, if you want video note guides (n.) to follow along with this video and all of my videos, then click here or check the link in the description 描述；说明. +

Anyway, remember that in the Age of Exploration, `主` the main motivation 动机；诱因 for European states to go *exploring (v.) on the sea* `系` was to find a sea-based route 路线；路径 to _the Spice 香料，调味品 Islands_ of Southeast Asia. Nobody *was looking for* two giant 巨大的；特大的 continents 洲；大陆 in the west -- that just sort of 有点儿 happened (v.) by accident 偶然地. The real goal 目标；目的 was to find a way over here. +

And Portugal was the first major 主要的；重要的 player in this #respect （事物的）方面，细节#.

•_In this respect_ we are very fortunate. _在这方面_，我们是很幸运的。 +
•There was one respect, however, in which they differed. 然而，他们在一点上有分歧。

.Vasco da Gama

Cape of Good Hope  好望角, 是南非开普半岛大西洋沿岸的一处岩石岬角。 +
一个常见的误解是"好望角"是非洲的南端，因为人们误以为好望角是大西洋和印度洋的分界点。事实上，**非洲的最南端是**位于东南偏东方向约 150 公里（90 英里）的**" Cape Agulhas 厄加勒斯角"** 。 +
然而，当从赤道沿非洲海岸线西侧航行时，好望角标志着船只开始"向东", 而非"向南"航行。

But during the 17th century and beyond (超出；除…之外) 在17世纪及以后, the Dutch, the English, and the French are going *#to do# their fighting #best#* 尽他们最大的努力战斗 to get _a piece of that juicy 有利可图的 Indian Ocean trade_. And so during this period, we see ① _this globalized (a.)全球化的 economy_ 经济 ② and _the competition_ 后定 that *it created accelerating* 加快；加速 /and *leading to* conflict 冲突；争执 /as _each of these maritime 海的；海事的 powers_ #*vied (v.)竞争；争夺 for*# dominance 统治；控制. +

[.my2]
但在17世纪及以后，荷兰人，英国人和法国人将尽他们最大的努力, 在印度洋贸易中分一杯羹。因此，在这一时期，我们看到全球化的经济, 和它所带来的竞争加速, 并导致了冲突，因为每个海洋大国都在争夺主导地位。

So in order to compete (v.)竞争；对抗 in this maritime (a.) economic climate, the French, the Dutch, and the English *created (v.) companies* to challenge (v.)挑战；对…怀疑（或质疑） the Portuguese. The Dutch formed (v.) _the Dutch East India Company_, *also known as* _the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie_ 公司（等于 company） -- which #mercifully 仁慈地,幸运地# *is abbreviated* 缩写；缩略 /and hereafter 此后；以后 *known* in this video *as* the Dutch VOC. +

The truth is, `主` *investing (v.)投资 in* the VOC `系` was exceedingly 非常；极其 risky 有风险的；危险的, but when it was successful, baby, those investors (n.) *got paid* 获得报酬. +

The VOC was really the first transnational (a.)跨国的 corporation 公司；企业, /and historians 历史学家 have argued that /the VOC was actually _the most profitable 赢利的；有益的 corporation_ in history. +

Anyway, the Dutch became _so dang 非常 profitable_ /because they successfully challenged (v.) the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean trade. But the Dutch did things a little different *than* the Portuguese did. Like, the Portuguese were content (a.)满意的；满足的 to establish (v.) trading posts 贸易站 in all these places /and essentially 基本上；本质上 *treated* (v.) the inhabitants 居民 *as* business partners. In other words 换句话说, they didn't *go full colonial 殖民的；殖民地的 on them* 没有对他们实行彻底的殖民化. +

But by the end of the 18th century, the Dutch VOC was #_in tatters_ (碎布；碎纸) 破烂不堪, 破败；毁坏#, *largely 主要地；在很大程度上 because of* competition from the British East India Company. And I reckon 认为 we ought to talk about them now. +

The British East India Company struggled (v.)挣扎;奋斗；努力 initially 最初；开始 /but eventually 最终；最后 **provided** (v.) #stiff 激烈的；强劲的;不易弯曲（或活动）的；硬的；挺的# competition *to* the Dutch in the Indian Ocean trade.

[.my2]
英国东印度公司最初举步维艰，但最终在印度洋贸易中与荷兰人形成了激烈的竞争。当荷兰人占领东印度群岛时，英国人把目光投向了印度。

Now, as it happened, the Indian Mughal Empire 帝国 was in decline 衰落；衰败, and so whenever 不论何时,每当  *tensions 紧张局势；紧张状态 arose* (v.)出现；发生, the British inserted 插入；加入 themselves /and eventually gained (v.)获得；赢得 the entire 全部的；整个的 subcontinent 次大陆 as a colonial possession 殖民地, transferring (v.)转移 power *from* _the British East India Company_ *to* _the British government_ itself. +

And for our purposes here, one of the big outcomes 结果；后果 of that war in India was the French seizure 夺取；占领 of Madras （印度港市）, which was the British stronghold 据点；要塞 in India. At that point, it looked like France might come to control (v.) trade in all of India. But `主` the peace treaty 条约 that ended the war `谓` *sent* (v.)

Now, while all those economic rivalries (n.)竞争；较量 were occurring in the East, similar 相似的；类似的 developments were happening in the West -- namely 即；也就是, the growing Atlantic Ocean trade. +

As I mentioned in another video, for various 各种各样的；各种不同的 reasons after the end of the Eighty Years' War, the Dutch Republic became _the dominant (a.)占主导地位的；占优势的 maritime (a.)海上的，海事的 trade power_ in the Atlantic.  +
And Britain didn't like this, so they *engaged in* 参与 a kind of economic warfare 战争 by #instituting (v.)建立，制定（体系、政策等）；开始；实行# _the Navigation Acts_ 航海条例, which essentially said that `主` any goods 商品；货品 *being shipped to* Britain or its colonies 殖民地 `谓` had to *be shipped* on British vessels 船；舰. +

And this basically guaranteed (v.)保证；确保 a #monopoly 垄断；专营权# for British merchants 商人 /and made them fabulously 极其；难以置信地 wealthy 富有的；富裕的. On the other hand 另一方面, it *ended up* 最终成为 weakening (v.)削弱；减弱 the Dutch dominance in the Atlantic trade. +

So with the Dutch down, France became England's chief (a.)主要的；首要的 economic rival 对手；敌手 in the West. *And so* with that rivalry, what do you think they're gonna do? They're gonna *hug it out* 以拥抱结束? Oh man, they're gonna fight (v.) each other /because they're Britain and France, and why not? +

So this tension 紧张；紧张局势 is going *to lead to* a series of 一系列的；一连串的 wars, only _one of which_ I'll tell you about in this video, and we'll save the others for the next video. +

Now, recall (v.)记起；回忆起 the War of Spanish Succession, which we talked about before. `主` The great concern 担忧；忧虑 that *led to* this war `系` was about _the balance of power_ 权力平衡 on the European continent.

== 中文释义

好的，在美国大学预修课程欧洲历史的第五单元伊始，我们要谈论**全球市场的兴起，以及由此在欧洲各国之间引发的所有竞争。**但别担心，**如果这种竞争没有引发战争和大量的杀戮，那就不算是真正的欧洲经济竞争。**啊，我就知道你会这么想。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

你知道，当我们谈到欧洲的探索时代，以及由于哥伦布大交换和三角贸易的发展，欧洲各国之间的经济竞争开始加剧。在那个单元里，我们主要关注欧洲各国在美洲的活动。但在这一切发生的同时，印度洋贸易中的竞争也在日益激烈。  +

嘿，如果你想要这个视频以及我所有视频的笔记指南，那就点击这里或者查看描述中的链接。  +

不管怎样，记住**##在探索时代，欧洲各国进行海上探索的主要动机, 是找到一条通往东南亚香料群岛的海上航线。##没人想着要去发现西边的两块大陆——那只是偶然发生的。**真正的目标是找到通往这里的路。  +

**#葡萄牙在这方面是第一个主要参与者#。**葡萄牙水手瓦斯科·*达·伽马（Vasco da Gama）第一个绕过好望角，并在印度洋贸易中确立了葡萄牙的存在。就他而言，他到达的是印度。#在那之后，葡萄牙在印度以及后来在东南亚主导了贸易。#*  +

**但在17世纪及之后，荷兰、英国和法国, 竭尽全力想要在利润丰厚的印度洋贸易中分得一杯羹。**所以在这个时期，我们看到这种全球化经济, 以及它所引发的竞争不断加剧，并导致了冲突，因为这些海上强国都在争夺主导权。  +

所以，*为了在这种海上经济环境中竞争，法国、荷兰和英国成立了公司, 来挑战葡萄牙。荷兰成立了"荷兰东印度公司"*（Dutch East India Company），也就是"联合东印度公司"（Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie）——谢天谢地，在本视频中它被简称为荷兰东印度公司（Dutch VOC）。  +

**这家公司相当具有创新性，因为它是一家"股份制公司"，**这意味着它是一家通过向投资者出售股份来筹集资金的私人公司。**事实上，投资"荷兰东印度公司"风险极大，但一旦成功，那些投资者就能获得回报。 ** +

**"荷兰东印度公司"实际上是第一家跨国公司，**历史学家认为"荷兰东印度公司"实际上是历史上最赚钱的公司。  +

*##不管怎样，荷兰变得非常赚钱，##因为他们在印度洋贸易中成功挑战了葡萄牙。#但荷兰人的做法与葡萄牙人有点不同。比如，葡萄牙人满足于在所有这些地方建立"贸易站"，并基本上把当地居民当作商业伙伴。换句话说，他们没有对当地进行完全的"殖民统治"。#*  +

*相比之下，荷兰人在接管了以前葡萄牙的领地后，征服了当地人民，使他们臣服，并完全控制了东印度的大部分地区。*  +

**#但到了18世纪末，"荷兰东印度公司"陷入了困境，这在很大程度上是因为来自"英国东印度公司"的竞争。#**我想我们现在应该谈谈英国东印度公司。  +

"英国东印度公司"最初举步维艰，但最终在印度洋贸易中, 对荷兰构成了激烈的竞争。*荷兰人接管了东印度，而英国人则把目光投向了印度。*  +

事情是这样的，*印度莫卧儿帝国（Indian Mughal Empire）在衰落，所以每当局势紧张时，英国人就介入其中，并最终将整个次大陆变成了殖民地，并将权力从英国东印度公司, 转移到了英国政府手中。*  +

然后，法国的路易十四（Louis XIV）不甘落后，在他的财政大臣让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔（Jean-Baptiste Colbert）的影响下，成立了"法国东印度公司"。法国公司在印度与英国争夺权力和影响力。  +

还记得我们在第四单元谈到的**"奥地利王位继承战争"**（War of Austrian Succession）吗？在那场战争中，我们关注的是普鲁士和奥地利之间的冲突，但**法国和英国也参与了战斗，**你懂的，毕竟他们是英法，为什么不呢？  +

就我们这里的内容而言，*那场战争在印度的一个重大结果,* 是法国占领了马德拉斯（Madras），那是英国在印度的据点。在那个时候，看起来法国可能会控制整个印度的贸易。但结束战争的和平条约, 又把马德拉斯还给了英国，*英国重新确立了统治地位。所以法国转而将重点放在了"西印度群岛"的贸易上。*  +

现在，*当这些经济竞争在东方发生的同时，西方也在发生类似的情况——也就是"大西洋贸易"的不断发展。*  +

正如我在另一个视频中提到的，由于各种原因，在八十年战争（Eighty Years' War）结束后，*荷兰共和国成为了大西洋上占主导地位的海上贸易强国。英国对此不满，所以他们发起了一种经济战，制定了《航海条例》（Navigation Acts），该条例基本上规定，任何运往英国或其殖民地的货物, 都必须用英国船只运输。*  +

**这基本上保证了英国商人的垄断地位(英国商船垄断了英国外贸航运, 让英国商船赚得盆满钵满)，并使他们变得极其富有。**另一方面，*这最终削弱了荷兰在大西洋贸易中的主导地位。*  +

所以，**#随着荷兰的衰落，法国成为了英国在西方的主要经济竞争对手。#**那么，面对这种竞争，你觉得他们会怎么做呢？他们会友好相处吗？哦，伙计，他们会相互争斗，因为他们是英法，为什么不呢？  +

所以这种紧张局势引发了一系列战争，在这个视频里我只给你讲其中一场，其他的我们留到下一个视频再说。  +

现在，回想一下我们之前谈到的**西班牙王位继承战争（War of Spanish Succession）。引发这场战争的主要担忧, 是欧洲大陆的"权力平衡"问题。**当看起来路易十四要把法国和西班牙以及它们所有的殖民地联合起来时，权力平衡会严重向他倾斜。  +

*所以包括英国在内的一些国家, 组成了联盟, 来反对这种联合，并在1713年达成了《乌得勒支条约》*（Treaty of Utrecht）。就本视频而言，**该条约最重要的结果是: 法国不得不把一些殖民地割让给英国，**包括纽芬兰（Newfoundland）、新斯科舍（Nova Scotia）和哈得孙湾地区（Hudson Bay territory）。  +

**然后，西班牙被要求让英国控制其西非奴隶贸易，也就是所谓的“阿西恩托”（Asiento）。**关于这一发展，最重要的是**它导致了经济权力的巨大转移，对英国有利。**  +

Okay, here at the beginning of Unit 5 of AP Euro, we're talking about the rise of global markets and all the competition that caused between European states. But don't worry, it wouldn't be true European economic competition if it didn't also lead to war and massive amounts of killing. Ah, I knew that you would be. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

And you know, when we talked about the European Age of Exploration and how, due to the Columbian Exchange and the development of the Triangular Trade, economic competition between European states began to increase. And in that unit, we really focused on European states' efforts in the Americas. But while all that was going on, there was a growing competition in the Indian Ocean trade as well.

Hey, if you want video note guides to follow along with this video and all of my videos, then click here or check the link in the description.

Anyway, remember that in the Age of Exploration, the main motivation for European states to go exploring on the sea was to find a sea-based route to the Spice Islands of Southeast Asia. Nobody was looking for two giant continents in the west -- that just sort of happened by accident. The real goal was to find a way over here.

And Portugal was the first major player in this respect. It was Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama who first rounded the Cape of Good Hope and established the Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean trade. And in his case, it was India. And after that, Portugal dominated trade in India and later in Southeast Asia.

But during the 17th century and beyond, the Dutch, the English, and the French are going to do their fighting best to get a piece of that juicy Indian Ocean trade. And so during this period, we see this globalized economy and the competition that it created accelerating and leading to conflict as each of these maritime powers vied for dominance.

So in order to compete in this maritime economic climate, the French, the Dutch, and the English created companies to challenge the Portuguese. The Dutch formed the Dutch East India Company, also known as the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie -- which mercifully is abbreviated and hereafter known in this video as the Dutch VOC.

Now, this company was pretty innovative in that it was a joint-stock company, which means that it was a private company which raised money by selling shares to investors. The truth is, investing in the VOC was exceedingly risky, but when it was successful, baby, those investors got paid.

The VOC was really the first transnational corporation, and historians have argued that the VOC was actually the most profitable corporation in history.

Anyway, the Dutch became so dang profitable because they successfully challenged the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean trade. But the Dutch did things a little different than the Portuguese did. Like, the Portuguese were content to establish trading posts in all these places and essentially treated the inhabitants as business partners. In other words, they didn't go full colonial on them.

The Dutch, by contrast, when they took over previous Portuguese holdings, subjugated the peoples and made them subservient and took full control of much of the East Indies.

But by the end of the 18th century, the Dutch VOC was in tatters, largely because of competition from the British East India Company. And I reckon we ought to talk about them now.

The British East India Company struggled initially but eventually provided stiff competition to the Dutch in the Indian Ocean trade. While the Dutch took over in the East Indies, the British set their sights on India.

Now, as it happened, the Indian Mughal Empire was in decline, and so whenever tensions arose, the British inserted themselves and eventually gained the entire subcontinent as a colonial possession, transferring power from the British East India Company to the British government itself.

And then Louis XIV of France, not to be outdone, established the French East India Company under the influence of his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert. The French company vied for power and influence against the British in India.

And remember the War of Austrian Succession we talked about in Unit 4? There, we focused on the conflict between Prussia and Austria, but France and Britain got in on the fighting as well because, you know, they're Britain and France, and why not?

And for our purposes here, one of the big outcomes of that war in India was the French seizure of Madras, which was the British stronghold in India. At that point, it looked like France might come to control trade in all of India. But the peace treaty that ended the war sent Madras back to England, and British dominance was restored. And so France turned its focus on trade in the West Indies instead.

Now, while all those economic rivalries were occurring in the East, similar developments were happening in the West -- namely, the growing Atlantic Ocean trade.

As I mentioned in another video, for various reasons after the end of the Eighty Years' War, the Dutch Republic became the dominant maritime trade power in the Atlantic. And Britain didn't like this, so they engaged in a kind of economic warfare by instituting the Navigation Acts, which essentially said that any goods being shipped to Britain or its colonies had to be shipped on British vessels.

And this basically guaranteed a monopoly for British merchants and made them fabulously wealthy. On the other hand, it ended up weakening the Dutch dominance in the Atlantic trade.

So with the Dutch down, France became England's chief economic rival in the West. And so with that rivalry, what do you think they're gonna do? They're gonna hug it out? Oh man, they're gonna fight each other because they're Britain and France, and why not?

So this tension is going to lead to a series of wars, only one of which I'll tell you about in this video, and we'll save the others for the next video.

Now, recall the War of Spanish Succession, which we talked about before. The great concern that led to this war was about the balance of power on the European continent. When it looked like Louis XIV was going to unite France and Spain along with all their colonial holdings, the balance of power would have been inordinately tipped in his favor.

So a coalition of states, including Britain, fought against this unification and settled up in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Now, the most significant consequences of that treaty for the purposes of this video were that France had to give up some of its colonial holdings to Britain, including Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the Hudson Bay territory.

And then Spain was required to grant Britain control of its West African slave trade, called the Asiento. And what's most important to remember about this development is that it resulted in a massive economic shift of power into Britain's favor.
