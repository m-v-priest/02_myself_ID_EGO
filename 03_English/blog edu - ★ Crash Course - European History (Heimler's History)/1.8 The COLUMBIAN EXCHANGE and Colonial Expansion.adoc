== 释义

So `主` one of the major effects of the expansion of European maritime empires 欧洲海上帝国的扩张 `系` was the Columbian Exchange 哥伦布大交换. So I reckon 认为；估计 we ought to talk about it.  +
So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then baby, let's get to it 开始吧,我们出发吧,让我们去弄明白. +

All right, let's start with a definition. The Columbian Exchange describes (v.) the global transfer 全球转移 of goods, #flora 植物群#，#fauna （某地区或某时期的）动物群#，cultural practices 文化习俗，and disease 疾病 between the Old World 旧大陆（指欧洲、亚洲和非洲） and the New World 新大陆（指美洲） /as a result of European #imperialism (帝国主义;（商业、文化等向外国的）扩张；扩张主义)# 欧洲帝国主义.  +
So in the last video, we talked a lot about _the various  各种各样的 European states_ that had *#shoved (v.)猛推；乱挤；推撞# out* 挤出去；冲出去 into the Atlantic Ocean 大西洋 /and started the process of *setting up* sea-based empires 建立海上帝国 around the world -- *whether* those empires were more trade-based 以贸易为基础的 like Portugal's *or* more settler-based 以移民为基础的 like England's. +

.flora
-> 来自拉丁语Flora, 花神，词源同flower, flourish.

.fauna
法乌努斯（Faunus） 是罗马神话中的畜牧农林神，相当于希腊神话中的潘（Pan）。他是一个半人半羊的怪物，上半身是人的脸和手，但脸上长有羊角；下半身是羊，长有羊蹄和浓密 的毛发。他掌管森林、放牧、畜牧、植物、原野、丛林，受到农民和牧人的广泛崇拜。法乌努斯擅长吼叫和预言。他的吼声能使人们陷入恐慌，使战场上的军队惊慌 逃跑。他的预言能力更为出名，传说阿波罗的预言能力就是跟他学的。  +
英语单词fauna就来自法乌努斯的名字Faunus，表示“动物群”，常用于学术范畴。

Regardless 不管怎样，as `主` the societies 社会 of the Old World and the New World `谓` *came into* ever-increasing contact 接触越来越频繁，a great exchange occurred (v.) 后定 that would transform (v.)使改观，使变形，使转化 _the lives 生活 and the societies_ of everyone involved 相关的；牵涉其中的.  +
So let's *talk (v.) first about* what kind of things were exchanged 交换, and then we'll talk about the effects of that exchange. +

So *you do have to know* a couple #concrete 具体的；确实的# examples of the things that were exchanged, and I'm only going to name (v.) a few. These aren't the only examples you could use, so if others *make sense to* you, just *stick (v.) with* those. You know, you do you, boo 发嘘声，喝倒彩. +

So first, diseases were exchanged. Now it's #questionable 可疑的；有疑问的# whether indigenous Americans 美洲原住民 *gave* any diseases *to* Europeans to bring home, although some historians *argue (v.) that* #syphilis 梅毒# was one of them.  +
But `主` the main disease you ought to know for the Columbian Exchange `谓` came from Europeans 欧洲人 to the Americas -- namely #smallpox 天花#. +

[.my2]
首先，疾病交换。尽管一些历史学家认为梅毒是其中之一，但土著美洲人是否把任何疾病传染给了欧洲人，让他们带回家，这是一个问题。但是关于哥伦布大交换，你应该知道的主要疾病是从欧洲人传到美洲的，也就是天花

Remember how we *talked* in the last video *about* Spanish #conquistadors# (（16世纪侵占墨西哥和秘鲁的）西班牙征服者) 西班牙征服者 like Hernan Cortez 埃尔南・科尔特斯 *taking over* 掌握,接管 massive empires in the Americas *with* relatively few men? Well, it wasn't by the might 力量；威力 of their swords 宝剑 that they were able to do that, but by the might of their #nasty 不友好的；恶意的；令人不愉快的;危险的；严重的# germs 细菌,病菌.  +
Africans, Europeans, and Asians had been *in contact with* one another for millennia 千年，and therefore had been exposed to 接触到 each other's #filthy (a.)十分肮脏的，污秽的；淫秽的，下流的 cooties 虱子# /and had built up some immunity 免疫力.
But `主` the indigenous peoples of the Americas `谓` possessed (v.)拥有；具有（特质） no such immunity, and so the results were #devastating 毁灭性的，极具破坏力的#. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.filthy
(a.)
1.very dirty and unpleasant 肮脏的；污秽的 +
•*filthy rags/streets* 肮脏的破布╱街道 +
•It's filthy in here! 这里面脏得很！ +
——note at dirty +

2.very rude and offensive and usually connected with sex 下流的；淫秽的；猥亵的 +
•filthy language/words 下流的语言╱言辞 +
•He's got *a filthy mind* (= is always thinking about sex) . 他满脑子淫乱思想。 +

-> #来自foul, 恶臭的，污秽的。#
====

In fact, when natives of the Americas encountered (v.)遇到；遭遇 diseases like smallpox 天花, it created the occasion 特殊（或重大）场合，特殊（或重大）事件 for what became known as the Great Dying 大灭绝，in which indigenous populations #plummeted (v.)骤降；暴跌# -- in some cases by ninety percent.  +
For example, when the Spanish landed (v.) on the island of Hispaniola 伊斯帕尼奥拉岛，both the Arawak and Taino populations had lost (v.) 300,000 of their men, women, and children to smallpox.  +
Or take the #Incas 印加人# -- in 1530 they had a population of something like 9 million, but 100 years later, only half a million (50万). And so, you know, *no wonder* (v.)难怪,怪不得 they called it the Great Dying.  +
And to be clear, smallpox wasn't the only disease *in the mix* 参与其中, but it was #arguably 可论证地；可争辩地# the most deadly. +

Second, food was exchanged between the Old World and the New World. `主` Going from the Americas into Europe `系` were #high-yielding 高产的# and nutrient-packed 营养丰富的 foods like #maize 玉米#，tomatoes 番茄，potatoes 土豆，and #cacao 可可豆#.  +
`主` Coming from Europe and Africa into the Americas `系` were foods like rice and wheat 小麦，which became #staple (a.)主要的；基本的；重要的# foods 主食 in the Americas /and which ultimately changed their diet 饮食.  +
And a better diet means (v.) a healthier population and longer life spans 寿命 -- at least, you know, that was a long-term effect 长期影响 (to see previous point about, you know, the Great Dying). +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.staple
-> 英语单词staple通常表示“订书针”，但还可以表示“主要产品、主要成分、主食”等含义。这两种看似毫不相干的含义怎么存在于同一个单词呢？原来，staple来自古英语，本意就是事物的“#支柱或主干#”，与staff同源。订书针的两个针脚形如两根柱子，所以被称为staple。而古代的市场或仓库通常都立有柱子，所以staple##又衍生出“市场、仓库”之意，##后来##又进一步用来表示市场中销售或仓库中存放的主要物品。##  +
staple：['stepl] n.订书针，主要产品，主要成分，主食adj.主要的，大宗生产的，常用的vt.钉住 stapler：['steplɚ] n.订书机，主要商品批发商

====

And `主` the third thing exchanged `系` was minerals 矿物. And like disease, _the main transfer  （使）转移，搬迁 here_ was one way -- namely from the Americas into Europe.  就像疾病一样，这里的主要转移是单向的，即从美洲到欧洲。 +
Now _what do I mean_ by minerals 我说的矿物质是什么意思呢? Well, I'm talking about that sweet boom boom 模仿爆炸声或撞击声 -- I mean gold and silver 金银.  +
So after the #Incan (a.n.)印加帝国的# and #Aztec (a.n.)阿兹特克帝国的# empires were conquered (v.)征服，the Spanish #plundered (v.)掠夺；抢劫# them for their vast quantities of gold and silver, and that made (v.) Spain wealthy *beyond belief* 难以置信地. In fact, *it's #arguable 可论证的；有论据的# that* if this vast quantity of mineral wealth had not been found, then European #imperializers 帝国主义者# would not have continued (v.) to show up 到达，出现. +

[.my2]
事实上，可论证的是，如果没有发现大量的矿产财富，那么欧洲帝国主义者就不会继续出现。

[.my1]
.案例

.arguable
1.that *you can give good reasons for* 可论证的；有论据的 +
•*It is arguable that* giving too much detail may actually be confusing. 过分详细反而使人糊涂的说法**是有道理的**。 +

2.not certain; that you do not accept without question 无把握的；可疑的 +
SYN debatable +
•*It is arguable* whether the case should have ever gone to trial (= perhaps it should not have) . 这个案件原本是否应该审判还是个问题。 +
====

Now *even though* 尽管，虽然 `主` the minerals themselves `谓` were only flowing one way, `主` that #transfer (n.)转移，转让，调动# `谓` fundamentally transformed both the Old World and the New World.  +
It transformed 使改观，使变形 the Americas /by increasingly attracting (v.)吸引 growing numbers of European colonizers 殖民者 (and I'll talk about the #implications 影响；后果# of that /in a moment), but `主` the wealth flowing (v.) into Europe `谓` had a big effect as well. +

Now in order to understand this effect, we need *to take a step back* 回顾；后退一步 in European history.  +
*Prior to* the Age of Exploration 探索时代，the social, political, and economic system of Europe was known as #feudalism 封建制度#. And this was a system where peasants 农民 lived (v.) and worked on the land of a noble 贵族 in exchange for 以…… 交换 armed protection from the noble.  +
But with this #influx (n.)大量流入；涌入# of New World wealth, some parts of Europe experienced (v.) #unprecedented 前所未有的,史无前例的；（大小、数量、程度等）前所未知的，空前的# economic growth, so that *ended up* 最终成为 #hastening (v.)加速# the end of the feudal system.  +
And `主` what came to replace (v.)取代；（用……）替换 it `系` was an early form of #capitalism 资本主义#，which is an economic system based on private ownership 私有制 and _a free and open exchange_ of goods 自由和公开的货物交换 between property owners 所有者. +

Now to be absolutely clear, this was only the beginning of capitalist influence, and `主` these states `谓` still operated (v.) largely on #mercantilist 重商主义的# assumptions 假设. But the point is, `主` the shift 转变；转移 toward capitalism `谓` had begun. +

Now the fourth major transfer was people. And in the next video, I'm going to talk all about the African slave trade 非洲奴隶贸易，so here I'll just *leave it at that* 到此為止，告一段落 /and move on. +

Okay, in terms of 就……而言；从……角度来看 effects of the Columbian Exchange, let's start with the effects in Europe, because `主` one of the major motivating factors 推动因素 of this age of empire building 帝国建设 `系` was economic. Let's focus (v.) there.  +
So *prior to* this period, `主` a lot of the economic power in Europe `系` was focused in states around the Mediterranean Sea 地中海 and _the #robust (a.)繁荣的；强劲的# trade ports_ 后定 that had arisen (v.)（arise 的过去分词）产生；出现 over centuries of trade.  +
But in this period, economic power in Europe shifted (v.) *from* the Mediterranean states *toward* the Atlantic states 后定 that were busy building (v.) empires across the sea. +

[.my2]
好了，说到哥伦布大交换的影响，我们先从对欧洲的影响说起，因为这个时代帝国建设的主要动力之一是经济。让我们关注这里。在此之前，欧洲的经济力量, 主要集中在地中海周围的国家, 以及几个世纪以来建立起来的强大的贸易港口。但在这一时期，欧洲的经济实力从地中海国家转移到大西洋国家，这些国家正忙着在海上建立帝国。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.empire building
帝国建设：指一个国家或组织通过扩张领土、征服其他地区或建立殖民地等方式来增强自身实力和影响力的行为。
====

For example, during the globalization of the economy and exploration 探索, one of _the #primary 主要的；首要的# trade ports_ in Europe became Antwerp 安特卫普 in the Netherlands, which grew (v.) #exceedingly 非常，极其# prosperous (a.)极其繁荣的 /*due to* its central location 中心位置 to Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English trade routes 贸易路线.  +
Later, Amsterdam 阿姆斯特丹 would replace (v.) it as the major trading port of Europe.  +
And other Atlantic trading cities prospered (v.)繁荣；兴旺 as well, like London and Bristol 布里斯托尔. +

The second effect of the Columbian Exchange -- this time in the Americas -- was the #subjugation 征服；压迫；压制# of people.  +
For example, the Spanish imposed (v.)推行；实施；强制实行 an entirely new societal structure 社会结构 on the Americas called _the casta system_ 卡斯蒂利亚制度，which organized their societies hierarchically 分等级地 based on race 种族 and origin of birth 出身.  +
Additionally 此外，the Spanish established a system of _##coerced 强制，强迫，胁迫，迫使## labor_ 强迫劳动 known as #encomienda 委托监护制#. This was an economic and social system in which Spaniards could, by law, *exact* (v.) #tribute 贡品# and labor *from* indigenous Americans. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Casta
Casta （ 西班牙语： [ˈkasta] ）在西班牙语和葡萄牙语中意为“ 血统 ”，历史上一直被用作种族和社会标识符。在西班牙美洲帝国的背景下，该术语也指一种理论框架，该框架假定**殖民社会在基于种族的等级“ 种姓制度 ”下运作。**

*在历史文献中，种族区分、等级制度和社会地位, 在西班牙殖民时期美洲如何发挥作用, 一直是一个不断发展且充满争议的讨论。*   尽管现代历史分析中使用 sistema de castas （种姓制度）或 sociedad de castas （“种姓社会”）一词来描述基于种族的社会等级制度，西班牙人处于最高层，但**档案研究表明，并不存在一个固定的“制度”来固定个人的位置。相反，存在一个更加流动的社会结构，个人可以从一个类别转移到另一个类别，或者根据情况保持或被赋予不同的标签。**


.encomienda
是西班牙的一种劳动制度: +
-> 殖民者的权力: 将征服者征服的非基督教民族的劳动, 作为奖励。 +
-> 殖民者的义务: 征服者为劳动者提供福利，包括军事保护, 和教育。但实际上，被征服者所受的待遇与强迫劳动, 和奴役非常相似。许多情况下，土著人被迫从事苦役. 如果反抗，将受到极刑甚至死刑。然而， 卡斯蒂利亚女王伊莎贝拉一世禁止奴役土著人口，并视土著人为“王室的自由封臣”。

**"监护制"建立了一种类似于"封建关系"的制度，其中, "军事保护"与"某些贡品或特定工作"交换。**国王通常直接或间接地干预契约，保证协议的公平性，并在出现滥用行为时, 进行军事干预。


encomienda  (监护制)最早在西班牙在基督教"收复失地运动"后建立，并在西班牙殖民"美洲"和"西属东印度群岛"期间, 大规模应用。 +
从 1542 年的新法律开始，监护制在监护人去世时终止，并由 repartimiento (分配制) 取代。
====

Now by law, the #Spaniards 西班牙人# were required to offer (v.) protection to their #coerced 强制，强迫# laborers, but since Spain was so far away /and thus made it difficult *to check up on* 检查；核实 whether the Spaniards were keeping _this end （协议或交易的）一方责任/承诺的部分 of the bargain_ 履行协议，the encomienda system really #degenerated (v.)退化；堕落# into something #*akin (a.) to* 相似的，类似于# slavery 奴隶制. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.this end of the bargain
*"end"​​在此处 ​​不是“结束”​​，而是指 ​​“（协议中）某一方的义务或责任”*​​，属于该词的 ​​引申义​​。 +
*"End" 在此处的用法源自 ​​“协议的两端”​​（two ends of a bargain），即双方各自承担的部分。类似中文说“履行你的那部分协议”。* +

this end of the bargain​​= ​​“协议中西班牙人这一方应履行的责任”​​（即法律要求他们“保护劳工”的义务）。

== 中文释义

所以，欧洲海洋帝国扩张的一个主要影响就是"哥伦布大交换"（Columbian Exchange）。所以我觉得我们应该聊聊这个。所以如果你准备好获取知识，宝贝，那我们开始吧。  +

好的，我们先从定义说起。"哥伦布大交换"描述的是由于欧洲帝国主义，旧世界（Old World）和新世界（New World）之间在商品、植物、动物、文化习俗以及疾病方面的全球性转移。所以在上一个视频中，我们聊了很多关于那些**挺进大西洋（Atlantic Ocean）并开始在世界各地建立"海洋帝国"的欧洲国家——不管这些帝国是像葡萄牙（Portugal）那样以"贸易"为主，还是像英国（England）那样以"定居"为主。**  +

不管怎样，随着旧世界和新世界的社会之间的接触越来越多，一场伟大的交换发生了，这场交换改变了所有相关人群的生活和社会。所以我们先来谈谈交换了哪些东西，然后我们再谈谈这次交换的影响。  +

所以你确实需要知道一些具体的交换物品的例子，我只举几个例子。这些并不是你能举的唯一例子，所以如果其他例子对你来说更有意义，那就用那些例子。你懂的，按你自己的方式来，伙计。  +

首先，疾病被交换了。美洲原住民（indigenous Americans）是否把一些疾病带给了欧洲人并带回欧洲，这是值得怀疑的，尽管一些历史学家认为梅毒（syphilis）就是其中之一。但在哥伦布大交换中你需要知道的主要疾病是从欧洲传播到美洲的，也就是天花（smallpox）。  +

还记得我们在上一个视频中谈到像埃尔南·科尔特斯（Hernan Cortez）这样的西班牙征服者（Spanish conquistadors）, 用相对较少的人就征服了美洲的庞大帝国吗？嗯，他们能够做到这一点，靠的不是他们的武力，而是他们那些有害的病菌。非洲人、欧洲人和亚洲人已经相互接触了几千年，因此接触到了彼此的病菌并建立了一定的免疫力。但是美洲原住民没有这样的免疫力，所以结果是毁灭性的。  +

事实上，当美洲原住民遇到像天花这样的疾病时，就引发了所谓的“大死亡”（Great Dying），在这个过程中，原住民人口急剧减少，在某些情况下减少了百分之九十。例如，当西班牙人登陆伊斯帕尼奥拉岛（Hispaniola）时，阿拉瓦克人（Arawak）和泰诺人（Taino）的人口因天花失去了30万男女老少。再比如印加人（Incas），在1530年他们的人口大约有900万，但100年后，只剩下50万。所以，你懂的，难怪他们把这称为“大死亡”。需要明确的是，天花不是唯一传播的疾病，但可以说它是最致命的。  +

第二，旧世界和新世界之间交换了食物。从美洲传到欧洲的是高产且营养丰富的食物，比如玉米（maize）、西红柿（tomatoes）、土豆（potatoes）和可可豆（cacao）。从欧洲和非洲传到美洲的食物，比如大米（rice）和小麦（wheat），这些食物成为了美洲的主食，最终改变了他们的饮食。更好的饮食意味着更健康的人口和更长的寿命——至少，你知道，这是长期的影响（参考前面关于“大死亡”的内容）。  +

第三，交换了矿物（minerals）。和疾病一样，这里的主要转移方向是单向的，也就是从美洲传到欧洲。我说的矿物是什么意思呢？嗯，我指的是那些诱人的财富，我的意思是黄金（gold）和白银（silver）。所以在印加帝国（Incan）和阿兹特克帝国（Aztec）被征服后，西班牙人掠夺了他们大量的黄金和白银，这让西班牙变得无比富有。事实上，可以说如果没有发现这些大量的矿物财富，欧洲的帝国主义者就不会继续出现。  +

现在，即使矿物本身只是单向流动，这种转移从根本上改变了旧世界和新世界。它通过吸引越来越多的欧洲殖民者改变了美洲（我一会儿会谈到这其中的影响），但流入欧洲的财富也产生了很大的影响。  +

为了理解这种影响，我们需要回顾一下欧洲历史。**在探索时代（Age of Exploration）之前，欧洲的社会、政治和经济体系被称为封建主义（feudalism）。在这个体系中，农民在贵族的土地上生活和工作，以换取贵族的武装保护。但是随着新世界财富的涌入，欧洲的一些地区经历了前所未有的经济增长，所以最终加速了"封建制度"的终结。取而代之的是早期形式的"资本主义"（capitalism），**这是一种基于"私有制"以及财产所有者之间, 自由开放的商品交换的经济体系。  +

需要非常明确的是，这只是资本主义影响的开始，而且这些国家在很大程度上仍然基于重商主义的假设来运作。但关键是，向"资本主义"的转变已经开始了。  +

第四，主要的转移是人。在下一个视频中，我会详细讲述非洲奴隶贸易（African slave trade），所以在这里我就先说到这，继续往下讲。  +

好的，关于哥伦布大交换的影响，我们先从对欧洲的影响说起，因为这个帝国建立时代的一个主要推动因素是经济。我们就关注这一点。所以**#在这个时期之前，欧洲的很多经济力量, 集中在地中海（Mediterranean Sea）周边的国家, 以及经过几个世纪贸易发展起来的繁荣贸易港口。但是在这个时期，欧洲的经济力量, 从"地中海国家", 转移到了那些忙着在海外建立帝国的"大西洋国家"。(财富流在哪边, 繁荣的城市就在哪边出现. 财富是具有吸引力的, 能吸引一切资源向它的方向流动.)#**  +

例如，在经济全球化和探索的过程中，欧洲的主要贸易港口之一是荷兰（Netherlands）的安特卫普（Antwerp），由于它处于西班牙、葡萄牙、法国和英国贸易路线的中心位置，它变得极其繁荣。后来，阿姆斯特丹（Amsterdam）取代它成为了欧洲的主要贸易港口。其他大西洋贸易城市也繁荣起来，比如伦敦（London）和布里斯托尔（Bristol）。  +

哥伦布大交换的第二个影响——这次是对美洲的影响——是对人民的征服（subjugation of people）。例如，*西班牙人在美洲强加了一个全新的社会结构，叫做"等级制度"（casta system），这个制度根据种族和出身, 对社会进行了等级划分(就跟中国阶级划分一样, 把人分成三六九等)。此外，西班牙人建立了一种强迫劳动制度，叫做"委托监护制"（encomienda）。在这个经济和社会制度中，西班牙人依法可以向美洲原住民索取贡品和劳动。*  +

*#从法律上来说，西班牙人被要求为他们的"强迫劳动者"提供保护，但是由于西班牙离得很远，所以很难检查西班牙人是否履行了这个约定，"委托监护制"实际上退化成了类似于奴隶制的制度。#*  +

So one of the major effects of the expansion of European maritime empires was the Columbian Exchange. So I reckon we ought to talk about it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then baby, let's get to it.

All right, let's start with a definition. The Columbian Exchange describes the global transfer of goods, flora, fauna, cultural practices, and disease between the Old World and the New World as a result of European imperialism. So in the last video, we talked a lot about the various European states that had shoved out into the Atlantic Ocean and started the process of setting up sea-based empires around the world -- whether those empires were more trade-based like Portugal's or more settler-based like England's.

Regardless, as the societies of the Old World and the New World came into ever-increasing contact, a great exchange occurred that would transform the lives and the societies of everyone involved. So let's talk first about what kind of things were exchanged, and then we'll talk about the effects of that exchange.

So you do have to know a couple concrete examples of the things that were exchanged, and I'm only going to name a few. These aren't the only examples you could use, so if others make sense to you, just stick with those. You know, you do you, boo.

So first, diseases were exchanged. Now it's questionable whether indigenous Americans gave any diseases to Europeans to bring home, although some historians argue that syphilis was one of them. But the main disease you ought to know for the Columbian Exchange came from Europeans to the Americas -- namely smallpox.

Remember how we talked in the last video about Spanish conquistadors like Hernan Cortez taking over massive empires in the Americas with relatively few men? Well, it wasn't by the might of their swords that they were able to do that, but by the might of their nasty germs. Africans, Europeans, and Asians had been in contact with one another for millennia, and therefore had been exposed to each other's filthy cooties and had built up some immunity. But the indigenous peoples of the Americas possessed no such immunity, and so the results were devastating.

In fact, when natives of the Americas encountered diseases like smallpox, it created the occasion for what became known as the Great Dying, in which indigenous populations plummeted -- in some cases by ninety percent. For example, when the Spanish landed on the island of Hispaniola, both the Arawak and Taino populations had lost 300,000 of their men, women, and children to smallpox. Or take the Incas -- in 1530 they had a population of something like 9 million, but 100 years later, only half a million. And so, you know, no wonder they called it the Great Dying. And to be clear, smallpox wasn't the only disease in the mix, but it was arguably the most deadly.

Second, food was exchanged between the Old World and the New World. Going from the Americas into Europe were high-yielding and nutrient-packed foods like maize, tomatoes, potatoes, and cacao. Coming from Europe and Africa into the Americas were foods like rice and wheat, which became staple foods in the Americas and which ultimately changed their diet. And a better diet means a healthier population and longer life spans -- at least, you know, that was a long-term effect (to see previous point about, you know, the Great Dying).

And the third thing exchanged was minerals. And like disease, the main transfer here was one way -- namely from the Americas into Europe. Now what do I mean by minerals? Well, I'm talking about that sweet boom boom -- I mean gold and silver. So after the Incan and Aztec empires were conquered, the Spanish plundered them for their vast quantities of gold and silver, and that made Spain wealthy beyond belief. In fact, it's arguable that if this vast quantity of mineral wealth had not been found, then European imperializers would not have continued to show up.

Now even though the minerals themselves were only flowing one way, that transfer fundamentally transformed both the Old World and the New World. It transformed the Americas by increasingly attracting growing numbers of European colonizers (and I'll talk about the implications of that in a moment), but the wealth flowing into Europe had a big effect as well.

Now in order to understand this effect, we need to take a step back in European history. Prior to the Age of Exploration, the social, political, and economic system of Europe was known as feudalism. And this was a system where peasants lived and worked on the land of a noble in exchange for armed protection from the noble. But with this influx of New World wealth, some parts of Europe experienced unprecedented economic growth, so that ended up hastening the end of the feudal system. And what came to replace it was an early form of capitalism, which is an economic system based on private ownership and a free and open exchange of goods between property owners.

Now to be absolutely clear, this was only the beginning of capitalist influence, and these states still operated largely on mercantilist assumptions. But the point is, the shift toward capitalism had begun.

Now the fourth major transfer was people. And in the next video, I'm going to talk all about the African slave trade, so here I'll just leave it at that and move on.

Okay, in terms of effects of the Columbian Exchange, let's start with the effects in Europe, because one of the major motivating factors of this age of empire building was economic. Let's focus there. So prior to this period, a lot of the economic power in Europe was focused in states around the Mediterranean Sea and the robust trade ports that had arisen over centuries of trade. But in this period, economic power in Europe shifted from the Mediterranean states toward the Atlantic states that were busy building empires across the sea.

For example, during the globalization of the economy and exploration, one of the primary trade ports in Europe became Antwerp in the Netherlands, which grew exceedingly prosperous due to its central location to Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English trade routes. Later, Amsterdam would replace it as the major trading port of Europe. And other Atlantic trading cities prospered as well, like London and Bristol.

The second effect of the Columbian Exchange -- this time in the Americas -- was the subjugation of people. For example, the Spanish imposed an entirely new societal structure on the Americas called the casta system, which organized their societies hierarchically based on race and origin of birth. Additionally, the Spanish established a system of coerced labor known as encomienda. This was an economic and social system in which Spaniards could, by law, exact tribute and labor from indigenous Americans.

Now by law, the Spaniards were required to offer protection to their coerced laborers, but since Spain was so far away and thus made it difficult to check up on whether the Spaniards were keeping this end of the bargain, the encomienda system really degenerated into something akin to slavery.
