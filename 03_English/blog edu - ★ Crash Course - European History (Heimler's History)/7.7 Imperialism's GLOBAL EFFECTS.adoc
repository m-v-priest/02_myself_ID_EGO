== 释义

All right, if you were here for the last video, we talked about the second wave of European imperialism. Now in part two, we need to talk about the effects /that wave of imperialism had on Europe itself /and the African and Asian peoples /they went out to conquer. So I hope you can already taste the sauce, and if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So once industrialized (a.) European states *set (v.) their sights on* 把目光投向；以……为目标 Africa /as the object of their imperialistic 帝国主义的 impulses 冲动, they got to *carving 雕刻 up* 瓜分 the continent *quick, fast, and in a hurry*. And they did this, as I mentioned in the last video, so that /they could gain access to 获得；接近 more raw materials /to feed (v.) their factories /and to find (v.) new markets /for their manufactured goods.  +
But `主` the greatness of these imperial nations `系` was on the line 处于危险中 too. `主` The slogan 口号 of the era `谓` might as well have been /"`主` *#he#* _who *dies (v.) with* the biggest empire_ `谓` *#wins#* (v.)." +

[.my2]
但这些帝国的伟大也岌岌可危。那个时代的口号或许应该是“谁死的时候帝国最大，谁就赢”。

And so /`主` #the race# to colonize (v.)殖民 Africa, known as _the Scramble 攀爬，爬行；（互相推撞的）争夺，争抢 for Africa_ 非洲争夺战, `谓` #ended up# 最终成为 creating (v.) significant tension between European states /who all wanted (v.) the biggest piece of the African pie /for themselves. And this tension seemed as if /it would lead to war at any moment.  +
Therefore, starting in 1884, Otto von Bismarck called the Berlin Conference, which was a series of meetings /in which the imperial powers 帝国主义列强 of Europe could *carve (v.) Africa up* peacefully /through discussion and negotiation 谈判；协商. +

You know, it actually worked. Like after the Berlin Conference, `主` almost the entire continent of Africa `谓` was claimed by one of the European imperial powers, and they did it peacefully. Well done, Otto, you made everybody happy -- except the entire continent of Africans /whom you did not invite (v.) to the conference, who might have, you know, objected (v.)反对. But you didn't think everybody *lived (v.) happily* ever 一直，始终 after, did you? Don't be crazy. +

但你们该不会以为，每个人就从此过上了幸福的生活了吧？别天真了。

Like even though 即使，纵然 the boundaries 边界 of African colonies were agreed upon at the Berlin Conference, it didn't take long /before those tensions between European states flared up 爆发；突然加剧 again 但欧洲各国之间的紧张局势, 没过多久就再次爆发了. Like `主` it `谓` did, for example, in the Fashoda 地名 Crisis. Both Britain and France wanted to connect (v.) their African empires via railroad, but there was a big fat 厚的，宽的；巨额的 problem for both of them, namely Fashoda, which was owned by neither of them.

在这句话中，"like" 是一个口语化的填充词（filler word），没有实际含义，仅用于表达说话时的思考过程或强调语气。这里的 "like" 并不改变句子的核心意思，而是让表达更自然、口语化，类似于中文的“就是说”“那个”“你看”等语气词。在正式写作中，通常会省略这种 "like"，但在日常对话或非正式文本中很常见.

Both nations ended up sending military forces into Fashoda /and were on the brink of war 处于战争边缘. However, the French knew that they were very much outnumbered  (v.)[计划]数量上超过,人数上占劣势的 and outgunned (v.)在火力方面超过；枪打得比……准；战胜（某人或球队） 火力上占劣势的 by the British, and so they withdrew 撤退, conceding 承认；让步 the territory to Britain. Now the French did this /*not only* because they were outnumbered (v.)数量上超过, *but also* they could see the growing influence of Germany in Africa and in Europe. And in that way, France very much needed a friend in Britain /to fend off 抵御；抵抗 potential future conflicts with Germany. +

So France and Britain signed the Entente  (n.)协约；谅解；协定;（国家间的）友好关系 Cordiale 友好协定 in 1904, which established friendly relations between those two nations.

And there were also the Moroccan  摩洛哥的 Crises. Like if France thought that they needed *to buddy  (v.)与…成为朋友，与…结交 up （为谋私利）亲近（某人），（和某人）结交'结盟；联合 with* Britain /*to fend off* German aggression 侵略, *turns out* they were right.  +
At the Berlin Conference, it was decided that `主` France would control (v.) most of North Africa, including Morocco. But the Germans weren't too keen (a.) on 对……热衷 this, and so in 1905 and 1911, the Germans backed (v.)支持 native (a.)本地出生的 Moroccan rebellions 叛乱 against the French. +

.Entente Cordiale 英法协约,友好协约

协约国（Entente Cordiale）
协约国是英国和法国于1904年签署的一系列协议，旨在解决两国之间长期的殖民地争端，尤其是在埃及和摩洛哥问题上。这个协议的主要影响包括：

- 结束了英法之间的敌对关系：两国在非洲等地的殖民扩张中曾多次发生冲突（例如法绍达事件），关系紧张。协约国的签署标志着两国从竞争对手转变为友好国家，为未来的合作奠定了基础。

- 对抗德国的共同立场：协约国并非一个军事同盟，但它通过解决殖民地摩擦，使英法能够将注意力转向共同的担忧：日益强大的德国。德国的崛起，尤其是在海军方面的扩张，让两国都感到威胁。协约国实际上是两国为对抗德国而建立的“友好联盟”。

- 为三方协约（Triple Entente）铺路：随着英法关系的改善，英国后来也与法国的盟友俄国解决了殖民地问题，于1907年签署了英俄协约。这三个国家（英国、法国、俄国）形成的“三方协约”，成为与德国、奥匈帝国和意大利组成的“三国同盟”相抗衡的主要力量，最终形成了第一次世界大战的两大对立阵营。

Wikipedia 的 讲解:

Entente Cordiale  友好协约. 《英法协约》 （ 法语发音： [ɑ̃tɑ̃t kɔʁdjal] ； 字面意思是 “友好协定” ）由英国和法国于 1904 年 4 月 8 日签署的一系列协议组成 ，英法关系得到了显著改善。*这项协议对两国来说都是一个转折点。*

*法国此前一直被其他欧洲列强孤立，部分原因是拿破仑战争的破坏、 自由主义的威胁.* 德国总理奥托·冯·俾斯麦也利用法国可能为普法战争失败寻求复仇、扭转领土损失并继续施压占领萨尔和鲁尔地区的担忧，成功疏远了法国与潜在盟友。

英国则在欧洲大陆奉行“ 光荣孤立 ”政策，不再关注力量平衡 ，只有在认为有必要保护英国利益时才会干涉欧洲大陆事务。

19 世纪最后十年，英法两国的局势发生了变化。




.英国为什么从“欧洲势力均衡政策”转向“光荣孤立”政策, 其原因是什么?

在19世纪，**#英国#**的外交政策确实经历了一个显著的转变。虽然“光荣孤立”这个词本身是在19世纪末才被广泛使用，但它所描述的**##外交实践，即避免与其他欧洲国家建立永久性同盟，##早在19世纪中期就已经开始成形。**

英国之所以采取这种外交策略，主要有以下几个具体原因：

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|1.英国强大的地理和经济优势
|地理优势：英国是一个岛国，与欧洲大陆隔海相望。这赋予了它天然的安全屏障，使其不像其他大陆国家那样需要担心来自邻国的直接入侵。因此，英国不需要依赖军事同盟来确保自身安全。

经济和海军优势：到19世纪中期，英国已经是“世界工厂”，拥有最强大的工业生产力和世界上最大的贸易帝国。**其海军力量无人能敌，**掌控着全球的航运和贸易路线。这种强大的经济和军事实力使得英国有信心独立行动，不**需要盟友的支持。**

|2.维持"欧洲均势"的根本利益
|*英国的核心外交目标, 一直都是维护欧洲大陆的"势力均衡"。这是为了防止任何一个单一国家变得过于强大，从而威胁到英国自身的安全和全球霸权。*

*#保持灵活性：如果英国与某个国家建立永久同盟，就会束缚自己的手脚。采取“光荣孤立”政策，让英国可以根据具体情况，灵活地支持任何一方，以遏制潜在的霸主#*。例如，当法国或俄国势力过大时，英国可以倾向于支持德国或奥地利，反之亦然。*这种不结盟的立场, 赋予了英国最大的外交自由度。*

**专注于殖民地扩张：**19世纪是帝国主义的黄金时代。英国的主要精力放在巩固和扩张其全球殖民帝国上。*#避免欧洲大陆的永久性同盟, 可以减少英国被卷入不必要的欧洲大陆冲突的风险，使其能够将资源和注意力集中在海外。#*

|3.*#对同盟的根本不信任#*
|*英国的政治家们普遍认为，##永久的军事同盟会带来更多的问题，##而非解决之道。他们担心：*

*#被盟友拖入不必要的战争：一个同盟国可能会因为其自身利益而挑起战争，并期望英国提供军事支持，从而将英国拖入一场与其核心利益无关的冲突。#*

*#限制英国的行动自由：签订同盟条约意味着英国必须履行对盟友的承诺，这会限制其独立决策的能力。#*
|===

从“光荣孤立”到"重新结盟"的转变:

到了19世纪末，德国的崛起（尤其是其海军扩张）开始打破欧洲的势力均衡，直接威胁到英国的海上霸权。这让英国意识到，传统的“光荣孤立”政策已经不再安全。英国不再能通过“坐山观虎斗”来维持欧洲的平衡，而是需要主动寻找盟友来对抗日益增长的德国威胁。

正是这种对德国崛起的担忧，促使英国放弃了“光荣孤立”，转而与日本签署了英日同盟，并最终与法国和俄国建立了协约国，形成了第一次世界大战前的两大对立阵营。这标志着英国外交政策的彻底转变。



“光荣孤立” 一词用于描述 19 世纪英国避免建立永久同盟的外交实践，该实践始于 1815 年至 1902 年。这一理念早在 1822 年英国退出 1815 年后的"欧洲协调"时就已形成，并一直持续到 1902 年英日同盟, 和 1904 年英法协约的签订 。由于欧洲被分裂为两大势力集团 ，英国与法兰西第三共和国和俄罗斯帝国结盟（即所谓的 “三国协约” ），共同对抗德意志帝国 、 奥匈帝国和意大利王国 （即所谓的“三国同盟” ）。


**#19 世纪英国外交政策的特点, 是不愿与其他大国建立永久的同盟关系。#**人们通常认为这种政策仅适用于 19 世纪后期，但一些历史学家认为，这种政策起源于 1822 年的维罗纳会议之后。当时，英国退出了由外交大臣乔治·坎宁主导的 1815 年后的欧洲协调 。坎宁的原则主导了英国外交政策数十年，总结如下：

Non-intervention; no European police system; every nation for itself, and God for us all; balance of power; respect for facts, not for abstract theories; respect for treaty rights, but caution in extending them...England not Europe...Europe's domain extends to the shores of the Atlantic, England's begins there.

这段英文总结了19世纪初期英国外交大臣乔治·坎宁（George Canning）所秉持的外交原则，这些原则奠定了英国“光荣孤立”政策的基础。

下面是逐句的详细解读：

1."Non-intervention; no European police system; every nation for itself, and God for us all"
这几句话是坎宁外交思想的核心。

- *"Non-intervention"：不干涉主义。英国认为其他欧洲国家的内部事务应该由自己解决，英国不应轻易介入。这与1815年后建立的“欧洲协调”机制（Concert of Europe）形成了鲜明对比，后者旨在通过集体干预来维持欧洲的稳定。*

- "no European police system"：反对建立欧洲“警察”体系。坎宁反对“欧洲协调”演变成一个由列强主导、可以随意干预他国事务的超国家机构。他认为这种体系会损害国家主权，并可能将英国拖入与其自身利益无关的冲突。

- "every nation for itself, and God for us all"：“**每个国家为自己，**上帝保佑我们所有人”。这句话是坎宁外交哲学的一句名言，形象地概括了其核心思想：*每个国家都应该以自身利益为首要考量，而不是被所谓的“欧洲大家庭”或集体责任所束缚。*

2."balance of power; respect (v.) for facts, not for abstract theories; respect (v.) for treaty rights, but caution in extending them"
这几句话阐明了坎宁在维护英国利益时的具体策略。

- **#"balance of power"：势力均衡。这是英国外交政策的基石。#**坎宁认为，为了防止欧洲大陆出现任何一个霸权国家，*#英国必须灵活地支持较弱的一方来制衡较强的一方。但与以往不同的是，这种“势力均衡”不再通过永久性同盟来实现。#*

- *"##respect (v.) for facts, not for abstract theories"：尊重事实，而非抽象理论。##坎宁主张, #"外交决策"应基于现实的利益和地缘政治情况，而不是基于诸如“神圣同盟”或“欧洲团结”等空洞的理念。#*

- "respect (v.) for treaty rights, but caution in extending (v.) them"：尊重条约权利，但对扩大条约, 持谨慎态度。这意味着英国会遵守已有的国际条约和义务，但会非常谨慎地签订新的、可能限制其行动自由的条约，尤其是永久性的军事同盟。

3."England not Europe...Europe's domain extends to the shores of the Atlantic, England's begins there."
这是最能体现英国孤立主义精神的一句话。

- "England not Europe"：英格兰不是欧洲。这不仅仅是一句地理上的陈述，更是一种政治和文化上的宣示。*英国认为自己与欧洲大陆是分离的，拥有独特的身份和利益。*

- **"Europe's domain extends (v.) to the shores of the Atlantic, England's begins there"：“欧洲的领地止于大西洋海岸，而英国的领地从那里开始”。这句话生动地描绘了##英国作为岛国，其战略视野和利益范畴是全球性的，而非仅仅局限于欧洲大陆。##**欧洲大陆国家忙于内部事务和陆上争端，而**英国则将目光投向了海洋和广阔的殖民地帝国。**


在 19 世纪的大部分时间里，英国试图维持欧洲现有的权力平衡 ，同时保护通往其殖民地和领地的贸易路线，尤其是那些通过苏伊士运河, 连接英属印度的贸易路线。


1871 年德意志帝国成立后， 俾斯麦认为两线作战对德国来说可能是致命的；他的主要外交政策目标是与俄罗斯建立友好关系，并孤立法国。

历史学家们一直在争论英国的孤立主义是有意为之，还是受当时事件的影响。

As a result, it smelled like war was in the air. But remember, France and Britain *hugged 拥抱；搂抱 it out* 通过拥抱解决问题;化解矛盾，和好 in the Entente Cordiale, and so Germany, without the support of their allies, decided it was a bad move to test (v.) the strength of that alliance. And ultimately (ad.)最终，最后, the conflict was solved (v.) through diplomacy 外交手段, in which `主` France retained (v.)保留 control of Morocco. But `主` what this crisis demonstrated 表明；证明 `系`  was the increasing bond 纽带；联系 between France and Britain /and the increasing antagonism (n.)对抗；敌对;敌意，对立情绪 between them and Germany, which is going to come back around 循环、重现;轮回 in World War I 这种矛盾（英法与德国的对抗）会在一战中再次爆发. +



Now while all this is going on 进行，发生 in Africa /between the heads of European states 欧洲各国首脑, there was a growing objection 反对 among some Europeans /about whether imperialism 帝国主义 was a good thing at all. Now to be clear, this was not a majority voice. Most Europeans saw precisely （用于表示完全同意）的确如此 nothing wrong with 没有什么错,没有什么毛病  imperialism. But there were some 后定 who objected (v.), and that objection *gave rise to* 引起；导致 an increasingly tense debate 辩论；争论 over imperial ventures 帝国主义冒险活动. +

The first objectors 反对者 you should know `系` were artists. British writer Joseph Conrad `谓` traveled to the Belgian 比利时的 Congo 比属刚果（刚果的旧称）, which was arguably 可以说;可论证地，按理 the most brutal 残酷的；野蛮的 of all the European colonial ventures 风险项目，冒险事业, and he *witnessed (v.)目击，亲眼看到 firsthand* (ad.)直接地 the degrading (a.)有辱人格的，贬低身份的 and violent policies 暴力政策 put in place there /by King Leopold II of Belgium.  +

The Congo was a different kind of colony /because Leopold kept it for himself, not for Belgium, and thus he enacted 制定；颁布 exceedingly 极其；非常 savage (a.)野蛮的；残酷的 and cruel policies against the Congolese  刚果人 /in order to enrich (v.) himself. +

So deeply disturbed by what he saw, Joseph Conrad returned and wrote (v.) his novel "Heart of Darkness," which *laid out 阐述；说明 _in graphic  详细的，生动的 detail_* (n.)细节，细微之处；详情，资料 the kinds of abuses 后定说明 the Congolese were experiencing (v.) under the imperial rule of Leopold. And though 虽然，尽管 it was a work of fiction 小说；虚构的事, `主` Conrad's criticism 批评；批判 of _the system of coerced (a.)强制，强迫 labor 强制劳动 and brutality_ 残酷；野蛮 `系` was apparent 明显的. +

And since we're talking about objections 反对，异议 to brutality in the Congo, you should know another British man, Edmund Morel, formed (v.)创立；使成形 the Congo Reform Association 刚果改革协会 to address (v.)处理，设法解决 violence in the Congo. He gathered (v.) many notable 著名的；知名的 writers of the era /and outlined (v.)概述，略述；勾勒 Leopold's violent policies in the Congo.  +
And as a result, these writers `谓` *flooded* 充斥；充满 the European consciousness 意识 *with* _arguments 争论，争吵；论据，理由 against Leopold's imperial venture_ 这些作家用大量反对利奥波德殖民计划的论据，淹没了欧洲人的意识（即广泛影响了欧洲公众的思想）. And ultimately, they forced Leopold *to transfer* (v.)（使）转移，搬迁 imperial rights of the Congo *to* Belgium itself. +

Another manifestation 表现；显示;表现形式 of the debate 讨论，辩论 over imperialism `谓` was concerned (v.) with the economics of the practice. Economist J.A. Hobson published a paper arguing that imperialism was ultimately a detrimental 有害的；不利的 economic system _in the long run_ 从长远来看 /because it *depended on* markets that were inherently 本质上；内在地 unstable. In other words, imperialism was a drag 累赘，拖累;阻力，抗力 on capitalism 资本主义. +

Over in Russia, Vladimir Lenin 列宁, who was certainly no friend of capitalism, found himself at least in partial agreement with Hobson. But while Hobson thought (v.) imperialism was an aberration 偏差；反常 of capitalism, Lenin argued that _it was the fulfillment 实现；完成 of capitalism_, and thus both imperialism and capitalism ought to be thrown out. +

Now as `主` non-Europeans 非欧洲人 who found (v.) themselves under imperial rule `谓` *went to* colonial schools and learned (v.) Western values, they began challenging (v.) European imperialism in various ways.  +
And in order to understand that, let's begin in Africa. In their colonies Natal 地名 and Zululand, the British had forced (v.) the native Zulus into working (v.) diamond mines  矿山, which was hard and dangerous work. +

Eventually, a nationalist 民族主义的 wave 民族主义浪潮 took hold 生效，确立，流行 among the Zulus as well, and they gathered an army of 40,000. The British attacked them, and for about 6 months /the Zulus scored 得到……的分数 many victories. But all it took was time 所需要的只是时间, and eventually the British were successful in crushing 镇压；粉碎 that rebellion. +

But over in Ethiopia, it was a different outcome. When Italy claimed Ethiopia, the Ethiopian king was like, "Oh heck no 绝对不." And remember that `主` one of the main reasons Europeans were so successful in subduing (v.)征服；镇压 the African continent `系` was because of their superior weaponry 先进的武器. So knowing this, the king of Ethiopia, Menelik II, purchased industrial-grade 工业级别的 weapons from France and Russia. So when the Italians *came* traipsing 疲惫地走；拖沓地行走；磨蹭  *in* 大摇大摆地走进 to conquer (v.), they were met with stiff resistance 顽强的抵抗, and the Ethiopians were successful in throwing them off /and remained an independent African state. +

== 中文释义


好的，如果你看过上一个视频，我们谈到了欧洲帝国主义的第二次浪潮。现在，在第二部分，我们需要谈谈这股帝国主义浪潮对欧洲自身, 以及他们试图征服的非洲和亚洲人民所产生的影响。所以我希望你已经能感受到其中的意味了，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

所以，一旦**工业化的欧洲国家, 将非洲**视为其帝国主义冲动的目标，它们就迅速、快速且急切地开始**瓜分这个大陆。**正如我在上一个视频中提到的，**#它们这样做, 是为了获取更多的原材料, 来供应它们的工厂，并为其制成品找到新的市场。#**但这些帝国主义国家之间也存在着激烈的竞争。这个时代的口号可以说是“拥有最大帝国者获胜”。  +

因此，对非洲的殖民竞赛，也就是所谓的“非洲争夺战（Scramble for Africa）”，最终在欧洲各国之间引发了严重的紧张局势，**这些国家都想为自己在非洲这块蛋糕上分得最大的一块。这种紧张局势似乎随时可能引发战争。**因此，从1884年开始，奥托·冯·俾斯麦（Otto von Bismarck）召集了**柏林会议**（Berlin Conference），这是一系列的会议，*#在这些会议上，欧洲的帝国主义列强, 可以通过讨论和谈判, 和平地瓜分非洲。#*  +

你知道，这实际上是起作用的。**#在"柏林会议"之后，几乎整个非洲大陆, 都被欧洲的帝国主义列强所占领，而且它们是和平地完成了瓜分。#**干得好，奥托，你让每个人都开心了—**—除了整个非洲大陆的人民，你们没有邀请他们参加会议，**而他们可能会有所反对。*#但你不会认为此后大家就过上了幸福的生活吧，别天真了。#*  +

即使非洲殖民地的边界在"柏林会议"上达成了协议，但欧洲各国之间的紧张局势, 没过多久就再次爆发了。例如在法绍达危机（Fashoda Crisis）中就是如此。*英国和法国都想通过铁路连接他们在非洲的帝国，但对他们来说有一个大问题，那就是法绍达（Fashoda），这个地方不属于他们任何一方。如果他们任何一方想要连接他们的铁路，这里就是一个关键地点。*  +

两国最终都向"法绍达"派遣了军事力量，并且处于战争的边缘。然而，**法国**知道他们在人数和武器装备上都远远不如英国，所以他们撤退了，**把这块领土让给了英国。**法国这样做不仅是因为他们在人数上处于劣势，还**#因为他们看到了德国在非洲和欧洲日益增长的影响力。从这个角度来看，法国非常需要英国这个盟友, 来抵御未来与德国的潜在冲突。#**  +

所以法国和英国在1904年签署了《友好协约》（Entente Cordiale），在两国之间建立了友好关系。还有摩洛哥危机（Moroccan Crises）。就像法国认为他们需要与英国结盟, 来抵御德国的侵略一样，事实证明他们是对的。*在"柏林会议"上，决定由法国控制包括摩洛哥（Morocco）在内的大部分北非地区。但德国人对此不太满意，所以在1905年和1911年，德国人支持摩洛哥本土的反叛势力对抗法国。*  +

结果，战争的气息弥漫开来。但要记住，**法国和英国通过《友好协约》紧密结盟，所以德国在没有盟友支持的情况下，认为挑战这一联盟的实力, 是一个糟糕的举动。**最终，这场冲突通过外交手段得以解决，法国保留了对摩洛哥的控制权。但**这场危机表明，法国和英国之间的联系日益紧密，而它们与德国之间的对抗也日益加剧，这种情况在"第一次世界大战"中还会再次出现。**  +

当欧洲各国的领导人在非洲的这些事情发生时，**#一些欧洲人, 对"帝国主义是否是一件好事", 提出了越来越多的反对意见。需要明确的是，这并不是大多数人的声音。大多数欧洲人认为"帝国主义"并没有什么错。#**但确实有一些人表示反对，这种反对引发了关于帝国主义冒险行为的日益激烈的辩论。  +

你应该知道的第一批反对者是作家,艺术家。英国作家约瑟夫·康拉德（Joseph Conrad）前往比利时刚果（Belgian Congo），可以说这是所有欧洲殖民冒险中最残酷的地方，他亲眼目睹了比利时国王利奥波德二世（King Leopold II）在那里实施的, 有辱人格和暴力的政策。刚果是一个不同类型的殖民地，因为利奥波德是为了自己占有这块殖民地，而不是为了比利时，因此他对比利时刚果人实施了极其野蛮和残酷的政策, 来使自己致富。  +

约瑟夫·康拉德对他所看到的情况深感不安，他回国后写了小说《黑暗之心》（"Heart of Darkness"），详细地描绘了刚果人在利奥波德的帝国统治下, 所遭受的种种虐待。尽管这是一部小说，但康拉德对强迫劳动和残暴制度的批判, 是显而易见的。  +

既然我们在谈论对比利时刚果残暴行为的反对，你应该知道另一个英国人埃德蒙·莫雷尔（Edmund Morel）, 成立了"刚果改革协会"（Congo Reform Association）, 来解决刚果的暴力问题。他召集了那个时代的许多著名作家，概述了利奥波德在刚果的暴力政策。结果，这些作家向欧洲人的意识中, 灌输了反对"利奥波德帝国主义冒险行为"的观点。最终，他们迫使利奥波德将刚果的统治权, 移交给比利时政府。  +

关于帝国主义的辩论的另一个表现, 是对这种行为的"经济方面"的关注。经济学家J.A.霍布森（J.A. Hobson）发表了一篇论文，认为从长远来看，帝国主义最终是一个有害的经济体系，因为它依赖于本质上不稳定的市场。换句话说，帝国主义是资本主义的拖累。  +

在俄罗斯，弗拉基米尔·列宁（Vladimir Lenin）当然不是资本主义的朋友，他发现自己至少在部分上同意霍布森的观点。但霍布森认为, 帝国主义是资本主义的一种畸变，而列宁则认为, 帝国主义是资本主义的必然结果，因此帝国主义和资本主义都应该被摒弃(结果, 斯大林的苏联成了帝国主义)。  +

现在，那些处于帝国主义统治下的非欧洲人, 进入殖民学校，学习西方的价值观，他们开始以各种方式挑战欧洲的帝国主义。为了理解这一点，让我们从非洲开始说起。在他们的殖民地纳塔尔（Natal）和祖鲁兰（Zululand），英国强迫当地的祖鲁人（Zulus）进入钻石矿工作，这是艰苦而危险的工作。  +

最终，一股民族主义浪潮在祖鲁人中兴起，他们集结了一支4万人的军队。英国对他们发动了攻击，在大约6个月的时间里，祖鲁人取得了许多胜利。但随着时间的推移，最终英国成功地镇压了这场叛乱。  +

但在埃塞俄比亚（Ethiopia），结果却不同。当意大利声称对埃塞俄比亚拥有主权时，埃塞俄比亚国王说：“哦，绝对不行。” 要记住，**欧洲人能够成功征服非洲大陆的一个主要原因, 是他们拥有先进的武器装备。所以埃塞俄比亚国王孟尼利克二世（Menelik II）从法国和俄罗斯购买了工业级别的武器 (以夷制夷)。**所以当意大利人前来征服时，他们遭到了顽强的抵抗，埃塞俄比亚人成功地将他们赶走，保持了自己作为一个独立的非洲国家的地位。  +

All right, if you were here for the last video, we talked about the second wave of European imperialism. Now in part two, we need to talk about the effects that wave of imperialism had on Europe itself and the African and Asian peoples they went out to conquer. So I hope you can already taste the sauce, and if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

So once industrialized European states set their sights on Africa as the object of their imperialistic impulses, they got to carving up the continent quick, fast, and in a hurry. And they did this, as I mentioned in the last video, so that they could gain access to more raw materials to feed their factories and to find new markets for their manufactured goods. But the greatness of these imperial nations was on the line too. The slogan of the era might as well have been "he who dies with the biggest empire wins."

And so the race to colonize Africa, known as the Scramble for Africa, ended up creating significant tension between European states who all wanted the biggest piece of the African pie for themselves. And this tension seemed as if it would lead to war at any moment. Therefore, starting in 1884, Otto von Bismarck called the Berlin Conference, which was a series of meetings in which the imperial powers of Europe could carve Africa up peacefully through discussion and negotiation.

You know, it actually worked. Like after the Berlin Conference, almost the entire continent of Africa was claimed by one of the European imperial powers, and they did it peacefully. Well done, Otto, you made everybody happy -- except the entire continent of Africans whom you did not invite to the conference, who might have, you know, objected. But you didn't think everybody lived happily ever after, did you? Don't be crazy.

Like even though the boundaries of African colonies were agreed upon at the Berlin Conference, it didn't take long before those tensions between European states flared up again. Like it did, for example, in the Fashoda Crisis. Both Britain and France wanted to connect their African empires via railroad, but there was a big fat problem for both of them, namely Fashoda, which was owned by neither of them. Like if either of them were going to connect their railways, this was a key location.

Both nations ended up sending military forces into Fashoda and were on the brink of war. However, the French knew that they were very much outnumbered and outgunned by the British, and so they withdrew, conceding the territory to Britain. Now the French did this not only because they were outnumbered, but also they could see the growing influence of Germany in Africa and in Europe. And in that way, France very much needed a friend in Britain to fend off potential future conflicts with Germany.

So France and Britain signed the Entente Cordiale in 1904, which established friendly relations between those two nations. And there were also the Moroccan Crises. Like if France thought that they needed to buddy up with Britain to fend off German aggression, turns out they were right. At the Berlin Conference, it was decided that France would control most of North Africa, including Morocco. But the Germans weren't too keen on this, and so in 1905 and 1911, the Germans backed native Moroccan rebellions against the French.

As a result, it smelled like war was in the air. But remember, France and Britain hugged it out in the Entente Cordiale, and so Germany, without the support of their allies, decided it was a bad move to test the strength of that alliance. And ultimately, the conflict was solved through diplomacy, in which France retained control of Morocco. But what this crisis demonstrated was the increasing bond between France and Britain and the increasing antagonism between them and Germany, which is going to come back around in World War I.

Now while all this is going on in Africa between the heads of European states, there was a growing objection among some Europeans about whether imperialism was a good thing at all. Now to be clear, this was not a majority voice. Most Europeans saw precisely nothing wrong with imperialism. But there were some who objected, and that objection gave rise to an increasingly tense debate over imperial ventures.

The first objectors you should know were artists. British writer Joseph Conrad traveled to the Belgian Congo, which was arguably the most brutal of all the European colonial ventures, and he witnessed firsthand the degrading and violent policies put in place there by King Leopold II of Belgium. The Congo was a different kind of colony because Leopold kept it for himself, not for Belgium, and thus he enacted exceedingly savage and cruel policies against the Congolese in order to enrich himself.

So deeply disturbed by what he saw, Joseph Conrad returned and wrote his novel "Heart of Darkness," which laid out in graphic detail the kinds of abuses the Congolese were experiencing under the imperial rule of Leopold. And though it was a work of fiction, Conrad's criticism of the system of coerced labor and brutality was apparent.

And since we're talking about objections to brutality in the Congo, you should know another British man, Edmund Morel, formed the Congo Reform Association to address violence in the Congo. He gathered many notable writers of the age and outlined Leopold's violent policies in the Congo. And as a result, these writers flooded the European consciousness with arguments against Leopold's imperial venture. And ultimately, they forced Leopold to transfer imperial rights of the Congo to Belgium itself.

Another manifestation of the debate over imperialism was concerned with the economics of the practice. Economist J.A. Hobson published a paper arguing that imperialism was ultimately a detrimental economic system in the long run because it depended on markets that were inherently unstable. In other words, imperialism was a drag on capitalism.

Over in Russia, Vladimir Lenin, who was certainly no friend of capitalism, found himself at least in partial agreement with Hobson. But while Hobson thought imperialism was an aberration of capitalism, Lenin argued that it was the fulfillment of capitalism, and thus both imperialism and capitalism ought to be thrown out.

Now as non-Europeans who found themselves under imperial rule went to colonial schools and learned Western values, they began challenging European imperialism in various ways. And in order to understand that, let's begin in Africa. In their colonies Natal and Zululand, the British had forced the native Zulus into working diamond mines, which was hard and dangerous work.

Eventually, a nationalist wave took hold among the Zulus as well, and they gathered an army of 40,000. The British attacked them, and for about 6 months the Zulus scored many victories. But all it took was time, and eventually the British were successful in crushing that rebellion.

But over in Ethiopia, it was a different outcome. When Italy claimed Ethiopia, the Ethiopian king was like, "Oh heck no." And remember that one of the main reasons Europeans were so successful in subduing the African continent was because of their superior weaponry. So knowing this, the king of Ethiopia, Menelik II, purchased industrial-grade weapons from France and Russia. So when the Italians came traipsing in to conquer, they were met with stiff resistance, and the Ethiopians were successful in throwing them off and remained an independent African state.

Okay, now another nationalist rebellion occurred in British India. Now in India, where the British East India Company ruled, a private military was established comprised of both British officers and sepoys, which were Indian soldiers that were either Hindu or Muslim. Because of the rapid Westernization occurring in India and the feeling that their native traditions and cultures were being lost or degraded, a surge of nationalism led the sepoys to rebel in an event known as the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857.

Once the rebellion began, it spread rapidly across India, which indicated that the Indians were not too happy with British colonial rule. And at first, the British only had a few troops to crush the mutiny, but eventually they did. And the major consequence of this rebellion is that possession of the colony was transferred from the British East India Company and squarely into the hands of the British government.
