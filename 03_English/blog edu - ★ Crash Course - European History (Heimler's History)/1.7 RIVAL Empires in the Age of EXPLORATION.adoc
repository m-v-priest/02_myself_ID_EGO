== 释义

Okay, now as European states began (v.) establishing Maritime Empires 海洋帝国 across the world, that was going *to lead to* some spicy 刺激的；粗俗的 sauce (辣酱) 激烈冲突；矛盾 between them.  +
And so in this video, I'm going to tell you about their Empires, and then I'm going to tell you about the tension 紧张局势；矛盾 that caused (v.)引起；使发生 between European States.  +
So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked (v.), well then let's get to it. +

Okay, so let's start with the major players 主要参与者 in the Empire game, and just for _poops 拉屎，排便 and Giggles_ (咯咯地笑) 开玩笑地；闹着玩地，let's start with Portugal.  +
Actually, it's not just for _poops and Giggles_ -- like Portugal was the first mover 先行者 in all this 就像葡萄牙是这一切的先行者一样, so you know, let's talk about them.

Now Portugal *is jammed (v.)挤；卡住 right here* in Spain's _bootiest <非正式>屁股，臀部 Maximus_, and *that meant that* they had trouble *conducting (v.) trade 开展贸易 with* other European states /without Spain interfering 干涉. So the Portuguese looked at the sea trade 海上贸易 to make that happen. +

.Spain's bootiest Maximus
"bootiest Maximus" 是一个幽默的改写，作者显然戏仿了拉丁语短语 ​​"_Gluteus Maximus_"​​（臀大肌，即人体最大的臀部肌肉），将其中的 "Gluteus"（臀部）替换为俚语 ​​*"booty"​​（俚语中指臀部，也有“战利品”的双关含义）。* +

​​
在此处的含义​​： +
字面​​：*指葡萄牙被“卡在西班牙的屁股后面”，即地理上紧邻西班牙（伊比利亚半岛的西部），被西班牙三面包围*。 +
"Booty" 在英语中既有“臀部”也有“海盗掠夺物”的意思，可能暗指大航海时代的殖民争夺。 +
"Maximus"（最大）则强化了这种夸张，暗示西班牙是“最强大的障碍”。 +

若需保留幽默，可译为“西班牙的臀大肌位置”或戏仿成“西班牙的尊臀之下”；若求直白，可译为“西班牙的后院”或“紧邻西班牙的角落”。 +

.booty
n.战利品；赃物；获得之物；<非正式>屁股，臀部

One of their chief 主要的；首要的 desires was to gain (v.) access to 获得；接近 the lucrative 利润丰厚的 spice trade 香料贸易 *going on* 进行，发生 in the Indian Ocean 印度洋.  +
And so under the leadership of _Prince Henry the Navigator_ 航海家亨利王子，Portuguese ships began (v.) making their way 前往某处 around the African Coast 非洲海岸.  +
Eventually, an Explorer 探险家 by the name of _Vasco de Gama_ 瓦斯科・达・伽马 *made it* all the way around _the southern tip_ of Africa 非洲南端 and into the Indian Ocean. +

Now once trade relations 贸易关系 were established, the Portuguese returned each year /and established trading ports 贸易港口 all throughout  遍及，到处 the Indian Ocean region.  +
So the term 术语 for this that you should know is that /the Portuguese established a _trade post_ 贸易站 Empire 贸易站帝国.   +
The idea here is that /the Portuguese 葡萄牙人 were not that *interested in* taking over 接管 _whole portions 部分 of land_ and their peoples /to expand (v.) their empire. Rather 相反，they simply established trading ports, and from those trading ports, the Portuguese dominated 主导；控制 the Indian Ocean trade in the 16th century. +

Now not long after the Portuguese *set (v.) sail* 启航 to establish their _trading post Empire_, Spain decided *to get in on* 参加（活动） the Empire game 参与帝国竞争 as well.  +
But instead of sailing around Africa, they commissioned (v.)委托；委任 Christopher Columbus 克里斯托弗・哥伦布 *to sail (v.) west* across the Atlantic 大西洋 *to gain (v.) access* into the Indian Ocean trade.
Well, *as it turned out* 结果是；事实证明，there were two giant honking 巨大的,按喇叭 continents 大陆 that no one in Europe knew (v.) about. +

So Columbus landed (v.) in the Bahamas 巴哈马群岛 and *went on* to explore (v.) parts of Cuba 古巴 and Hispaniola 伊斯帕尼奥拉岛. Eventually, Spain claimed (v.)宣称对… 拥有所有权 much of the Caribbean 加勒比地区，Central America 中美洲，North America 北美洲，and the coastline 海岸线 of South America.  +
Now the question is, how was Spain able to claim (v.) that much land? After all 毕竟，the Conquistadors 征服者；西班牙征服者 they sent -- you know, guys like Hernan Cortez 埃尔南・科尔特斯 -- they didn't have that many men with them *compared to* the huge Empires that the Spanish toppled (v.)（使）失去平衡而坠落，倾覆，推翻 in the Americas. +

Well, there are a lot of interweaving 交织的；错综复杂的 causes, but probably the most significant one was the introduction of European diseases like smallpox 天花 and measles 麻疹，for which the indigenous peoples 土著民族；原住民 of the Americas had no immunity 免疫力.  +
Now we'll talk more about how that happened /in another video, but the short version is that /these diseases wiped out 消灭；摧毁 an enormous percentage of the population in the Americas. But you know, Spain don't care -- they got themselves an Empire now, baby. +

So Portugal and Spain were the first major movers /in the maritime (a.)海上的，海事的 Empire game, but it wasn't long /before the Atlantic nations 大西洋沿岸国家 of France, England, and the Netherlands 荷兰 *joined in* as well.

France ended up 最终；结果是 claiming (v.) large parts of North America and Canada. The Explorer _Samuel de Champlain_ 塞缪尔・德・尚普兰 founded (v.) France's first permanent settlement 永久定居点 at Quebec 魁北克 in 1608. +
 But mainly, the French were *interested in* trade, and so they didn't end up establishing many colonies 殖民地 in which people actually went and lived. Rather 相反，they forged (v.)锻造（金属） alliances 结成联盟 with indigenous 本土的，固有的 groups 土著群体 like The Huron Confederacy (联盟；同盟；联邦) 休伦联盟 throughout their territory 领土 /and *got in on* 参与某事 the lucrative fur trade 利润丰厚的毛皮贸易 there. +

England, on the other hand 另一方面，was all about _the settler colonies_ 移民殖民地 -- which were colonies where English people actually *moved and settled* (v.) to find a new life.  +
Their colonies mainly hugged (v.)拥抱,紧挨着；贴近 the Atlantic coast of North America, and they *established a few* in the Caribbean as well.  +
But they also established these colonies in order *to compete (v.) economically 进行经济竞争 with* the other European states that I mentioned. Maybe `主` one of the biggest contributions to that economic competition `系` was the tobacco trade 烟草贸易. +

Now the Dutch -- *would say* (=that is to say) 也就是说 those people from the Netherlands -- also established colonies in North America during this time, but they, like the Portuguese, were mainly *interested in* trade.  +
So while they did reap (v.)获得；收获；收割（庄稼等） some economic success in their new world colonies, `主` _the main focus_ for the Dutch `系` was competing (v.) with the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean trade. +

[.my2]
因为当时还没有人向西横渡大西洋，所以他们认为在这片区域发现的任何岛屿, 都属于葡萄牙。

== 中文释义

好的，当欧洲各国开始在世界各地建立"海洋帝国"时，这引发了它们之间的一些激烈竞争。所以在这个视频中，我会给你们讲讲这些帝国，然后我会讲讲欧洲各国之间因此产生的紧张局势。所以如果你准备好获取知识，那我们就开始吧。  +

好的，那我们从帝国博弈中的主要参与者开始讲起。只是开个玩笑，我们从葡萄牙（Portugal）讲起。实际上，这可不只是开玩笑——**葡萄牙是这一切的先行者，**所以，我们来聊聊他们。*葡萄牙紧邻西班牙（Spain）,但被西班牙包围，这意味着在没有西班牙支持的情况下，他们在与其他欧洲国家进行贸易时会遇到困难。所以葡萄牙人着眼于海上贸易来实现贸易往来。*  +

**他们的主要愿望之一, 是参与到印度洋（Indian Ocean）利润丰厚的香料贸易中。**所以在航海家亨利王子（Prince Henry the Navigator）的领导下，*葡萄牙的船只开始沿着非洲海岸航行。最终，一位名叫瓦斯科·达·伽马（Vasco de Gama）的探险家一路绕过非洲南端，进入了印度洋。*  +

一旦贸易关系得以确立，葡萄牙人每年都会回来，**并在整个印度洋地区建立贸易港口。**所以你应该知道，**葡萄牙建立的这种帝国, 被称为"贸易站帝国（"trade post Empire）。**这里的理念是，*葡萄牙人对占领大片土地及其人民以扩张帝国(即"殖民地"方法), 并不是那么感兴趣。相反，他们只是建立贸易港口，并且在16世纪，葡萄牙人通过这些贸易港口, 主导了印度洋贸易。*  +

**在葡萄牙人起航, 建立他们的"贸易站帝国"后不久，西班牙也决定加入这场帝国博弈。但他们没有绕过非洲航行，而是委托克里斯托弗·哥伦布（Christopher Columbus）向西穿越大西洋（Atlantic），以进入印度洋贸易。**结果，那里有两块巨大的大陆，而欧洲人对此一无所知。  +

所以哥伦布在巴哈马群岛（Bahamas）登陆，并继续探索了古巴（Cuba）和伊斯帕尼奥拉岛（Hispaniola）的部分地区。**最终，西班牙宣称对加勒比海地区、中美洲、北美洲的大片土地以及南美洲的海岸线拥有主权。现在的问题是，西班牙是如何宣称拥有这么多土地的呢？毕竟，**他们派出的征服者——比如埃尔南·科尔特斯（Hernan Cortez）——与他们在美洲推翻的庞大帝国相比，*他们带的人并不多。*  +

嗯，**原因是多方面交织的，但最主要的一个原因是欧洲的疾病，比如天花（smallpox）和麻疹（measles）的传入，**而美洲的原住民对这些疾病没有免疫力。我们会在另一个视频中详细讲述这是怎么发生的，但简单来说，这些疾病导致美洲的人口大量死亡。但是，西班牙才不在乎呢——他们现在拥有了一个帝国，宝贝。  +

**所以葡萄牙和西班牙, 是"海洋帝国"博弈中的第一批主要参与者，但没过多久，法国（France）、英国（England）和荷兰（Netherlands）这些大西洋国家也加入了进来。法国最终宣称对北美洲和加拿大（Canada）的大片土地拥有主权。**探险家塞缪尔·德·尚普兰（Samuel de Champlain）于1608年在魁北克（Quebec）建立了法国的第一个永久定居点。**但主要是，法国人对贸易感兴趣，所以他们最终并没有建立很多人们真正前往居住的殖民地。**相反，他们与整个领土上的原住民群体，比如休伦联盟（The Huron Confederacy）结成联盟，并参与了那里利润丰厚的毛皮贸易。  +

另一方面，**英国热衷于建立定居者殖民地——也就是英国人真正迁移, 并定居下来开始新生活的殖民地。**他们的殖民地**主要分布在北美洲的大西洋沿岸，**并且他们在加勒比海地区也建立了一些殖民地。但他们建立这些殖民地, 也是为了在经济上与我提到的其他欧洲国家竞争。也许在这种经济竞争中，烟草贸易是最大的贡献之一。  +

现在说说**荷兰人**——也就是来自荷兰的人——在这个时期，**他们也在北美洲建立了殖民地，但他们和葡萄牙人一样，主要对贸易感兴趣。**所以虽然他们在新大陆的殖民地取得了一些经济上的成功，*但荷兰人的主要关注点, 是在印度洋贸易中, 与葡萄牙竞争。*  +

现在，这种在世界各地建立帝国的举动最终导致了几个欧洲国家之间紧张局势的产生。最显著的紧张局势最终引发了像西班牙王位继承战争（the war of Spanish succession）和七年战争（the Seven Years War）这样的战争，但这些战争要到下一个时期才会发生，所以我们会在另一个视频中讲述这些。  +

但在这个时期当中，最显著的紧张局势, 及其解决方案, 发生在葡萄牙和西班牙之间，下面是这个故事。*早在1481年，教皇将加那利群岛（Canary Islands）以南的所有岛屿, 都赐予了葡萄牙。在当时，由于还没有人向西穿越大西洋航行过，他们认为在这个大致区域发现的任何岛屿, 都将属于葡萄牙。*  +

快进到1493年，我们的哥伦布在为西班牙宣称对加勒比海的岛屿拥有主权后，正返回欧洲。在回到西班牙之前，他在葡萄牙停留，并告知葡萄牙国王, 他在加那利群岛的西南部发现了更多的岛屿。由于1481年的教皇诏书，葡萄牙国王说：“好吧，那些岛屿属于我们。” 但西班牙的费迪南德（Ferdinand）和伊莎贝拉（Isabella）说：“你们太疯狂了。” 所以你可以看到，这种对帝国的渴望开始引发紧张局势。  +

所以葡萄牙接着宣布，他们将派遣一支舰队去宣称那些岛屿是他们理应拥有的。而**西班牙知道, 他们无法战胜强大的葡萄牙海军，于是向教皇亚历山大六世（Pope Alexander VI）上诉，让他来决定这些土地归谁所有。最终，缓解紧张局势的结果是《托德西利亚斯条约》（Treaty of Tordesillas），该条约在这里划定了一条分界线。该条约将分界线以西的所有土地赐予了西班牙，以东的所有土地赐予了葡萄牙。**  +

**事实上，葡萄牙和西班牙在建立他们的"海外帝国"时, 并没有太在意这条分界线，**但重点是，它确实缓解了这两个帝国之间的紧张局势。好了，接下来你会想要点击这里观看我第一单元的其他视频——它们会告诉你第一单元你需要知道的所有内容。点击这里获取我的美国大学预修课程"欧洲历史"复习资料包，它包含了你在课堂上取得A以及在五月份的考试中获得5分所需要的一切。回头见。海姆勒下线了。  +

Okay, now as European states began establishing Maritime Empires across the world, that was going to lead to some spicy sauce between them. And so in this video, I'm going to tell you about their Empires, and then I'm going to tell you about the tension that caused between European States. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, well then let's get to it.

Okay, so let's start with the major players in the Empire game, and just for poops and Giggles, let's start with Portugal. Actually, it's not just for poops and Giggles -- like Portugal was the first mover in all this, so you know, let's talk about them. Now Portugal is jammed right here in Spain's bootiest Maximus, and that meant that they had trouble conducting trade with other European states without Spain interfering. So the Portuguese looked at the sea trade to make that happen.

One of their chief desires was to gain access to the lucrative spice trade going on in the Indian Ocean. And so under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portuguese ships began making their way around the African Coast. Eventually, an Explorer by the name of Vasco de Gama made it all the way around the southern tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean.

Now once trade relations were established, the Portuguese returned each year and established trading ports all throughout the Indian Ocean region. So the term for this that you should know is that the Portuguese established a trade post Empire. The idea here is that the Portuguese were not that interested in taking over whole portions of land and their peoples to expand their empire. Rather, they simply established trading ports, and from those trading ports, the Portuguese dominated the Indian Ocean trade in the 16th century.

Now not long after the Portuguese set sail to establish their trading post Empire, Spain decided to get in on the Empire game as well. But instead of sailing around Africa, they commissioned Christopher Columbus to sail west across the Atlantic to gain access into the Indian Ocean trade. Well, as it turned out, there were two giant honking continents that no one in Europe knew about.

So Columbus landed in the Bahamas and went on to explore parts of Cuba and Hispaniola. Eventually, Spain claimed much of the Caribbean, Central America, North America, and the coastline of South America. Now the question is, how was Spain able to claim that much land? After all, the Conquistadors they sent -- you know, guys like Hernan Cortez -- they didn't have that many men with them compared to the huge Empires that the Spanish toppled in the Americas.

Well, there are a lot of interweaving causes, but probably the most significant one was the introduction of European diseases like smallpox and measles, for which the indigenous peoples of the Americas had no immunity. Now we'll talk more about how that happened in another video, but the short version is that these diseases wiped out an enormous percentage of the population in the Americas. But you know, Spain don't care -- they got themselves an Empire now, baby.

So Portugal and Spain were the first major movers in the maritime Empire game, but it wasn't long before the Atlantic nations of France, England, and the Netherlands joined in as well. France ended up claiming large parts of North America and Canada. The Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded France's first permanent settlement at Quebec in 1608. But mainly, the French were interested in trade, and so they didn't end up establishing many colonies in which people actually went and lived. Rather, they forged alliances with indigenous groups like The Huron Confederacy throughout their territory and got in on the lucrative fur trade there.

England, on the other hand, was all about the settler colonies -- which were colonies where English people actually moved and settled to find a new life. Their colonies mainly hugged the Atlantic coast of North America, and they established a few in the Caribbean as well. But they also established these colonies in order to compete economically with the other European states that I mentioned. Maybe one of the biggest contributions to that economic competition was the tobacco trade.

Now the Dutch -- would say those people from the Netherlands -- also established colonies in North America during this time, but they, like the Portuguese, were mainly interested in trade. So while they did reap some economic success in their new world colonies, the main focus for the Dutch was competing with the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean trade.

Now this push to establish Empires all over the world eventually led to tensions arising between several European States. Now the most significant tensions would eventually erupt into Wars like the war of Spanish succession in the Seven Years War, but those don't occur until the next period, so we're gonna leave those for another video.

But in the midst of this period, the most significant tension and its resolution occurred between Portugal and Spain, and here's the story. Back in 1481, the pope granted all the islands south of the Canary Islands to Portugal. Now because no one had yet sailed West across the Atlantic at this point, what they were thinking was that any islands discovered in this general region right here would belong to Portugal.

Fast forward to 1493, and our boy Columbus was sailing back to Europe after claiming islands in the Caribbean for Spain. Before returning to Spain, he stopped in Portugal and let the king know that he had discovered more islands to the southwest of the Canary. And because of that papal bull from 1481, the king of Portugal was like, "Okay, those belong to us." But Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain were like, "Y'all so crazy." So you can see this thirst for Empire starting to cause tension.

So Portugal went ahead and announced that they were sending a fleet to claim the islands that were rightly theirs. So Spain, knowing they could not best the superior Portuguese Navy, appealed to Pope Alexander VI and asked him to decide whose land this was going to be. And eventually, the result that calmed the tension was the Treaty of Tordesillas, which drew a line of demarcation right here. The treaty granted Spain all the land to the West and Portugal all the land to the East.

Now in truth, Portugal and Spain didn't pay too much attention to this line as they built their overseas Empires, but the point is it did calm the tension between the two Imperial States.
