== Ancient Greece




=== 古希腊的政治制度

==== 暴君

In some city-states, the aristoi and the kakoi were not able to resolve their differences peaceably. In such cases, a man who had strong popular support in the city would seize power and rule over the city. The Greeks referred to such populist leaders as tyrants.

在一些城邦， 阿里斯托伊和卡科伊无法和平解决他们的分歧。在这种情况下，一个在该城市拥有强大民众支持的人 就会夺取权力并统治该城市。希腊人将此类民粹主义领导人称为暴君。

|(政府)委员会
|- Each of Athens’s four traditional tribes chose one hundred of its members by lot, including commoners, to sit in the new Council of Four Hundreds and run the government.

雅典的四个传统部落分别通过抽签选出一百名成员（包括平民）进 入新的四百人委员会并管理政府。

|议会
|By the end of the Archaic period, Athens had developed a functioning direct democracy, which differs from modern republics in which citizens vote for representatives who sit in the legislature. All citizens could sit in the Athenian Assembly, which then was required to meet at least ten times a year. All laws had to be approved by the Assembly. Only the Assembly could declare war and approve treaties. Athens had a citizen body of thirty to forty thousand adult males in the Classical period, but only six thousand needed to convene for meetings of the Assembly. Citizens could also be chosen by lot to sit in the Council. Since they were permitted to serve for just two one-year terms over a lifetime, many Athenians had the opportunity to participate in the executive branch of government.

到古风时期结束时，雅典已经发展出一种有效的直接民主制度，这与现代共和国不同，在现代共和国 中，公民投票选举立法机关的代表。所有公民都可以参加雅典议会，当时雅典议会被要求每年至少召 开十次会议。所有法律都必须得到议会的批准。只有议会才能宣战并批准条约。在古典时期，雅典有 一个由三至四万名成年男性组成的公民团体，但只需六千人来召开议会会议。公民也可以通过抽签选 出进入理事会。由于他们一生只能任职两次，任期一年，因此许多雅典人有机会参与政府行政部门的 工作。

|(司法)陪审团
|- All Athenians could appeal the ruling of a magistrate in court and have their cases heard by a jury of fellow citizens.

所有雅典人都可以 在法庭上对地方法官的裁决提出上诉，并让公民陪审团审理他们的案件。

- All citizens also served on juries, which not only determined the guilt or innocence of the accused but also interpreted the way the law was applied.

所有公民还担任陪审团成员，陪审团不仅确定被告有罪或无罪，还解释法律的适用方式。

- Women, enslaved people, and foreign residents could not participate.

妇 女、奴隶和外国居民不能参加(陪审团)。
|===

Solon also set up a hierarchal system in which citizens were eligible for positions in government based on wealth instead of hereditary privilege. Wealth was measured by the amount of grain and olive oil a citizen’s land could produce. Only the wealthiest could serve as a magistrate, sit on the Council, and attend the Assembly and jury courts. Citizens with less wealth could participate in all these activities but could not serve as magistrates. The poorest could only attend the Assembly and the jury courts.


梭伦还建立了等级制度，其 中公民根据财富而不是世袭特权获得政府职位。财富是根据公民土地可生产的谷物和橄榄油的数量来 衡量的。只有最富有的人才能担任治安法官、担任理事会成员、出席议会和陪审法庭。财富较少的公 民可以参加所有这些活动，但不能担任地方法官。最穷的人只能出席议会和陪审法庭。

==== 斯巴达的政治制度

Sparta had two hereditary kings drawn from rival royal families. Their powers were very limited, though both sat as permanent members of the Council of Elders and were priests in the state religion. On occasion, the Spartan kings also led armies into battle. The Assembly of Spartiates passed all laws and approved all treaties with the advice of the Council of Elders. This Assembly also elected five judges every year who administered the affairs of state, as well as the members of the Council of Elders.

When a Spartiate man reached the age of thirty, he could marry, vote in the Assembly, and serve as a judge. Each Spartiate remained in the army reserve until the age of sixty, when he could finally retire from military service and became eligible for election to the Council of Elders.

斯巴达有两位世袭国王，分别来自敌对的王室家族。虽然他们的权力非常有限，但两位国王都是元老委员会的永久成员，并且是国家宗教的祭司。在某些情况下，斯巴达国王还会率领军队出征。斯巴达人大会在元老委员会的建议下通过所有法律并批准所有条约。这个大会还每年选出五位法官，他们负责管理国家事务，并选举元老委员会的成员。

当斯巴达男子年满三十岁时，他可以结婚、在议会投票并担任法官。每个斯巴达人都留在预备役部队 直到六十岁，那时他终于可以退役并有资格当选为长老会成员。

=== 古希腊的学术发展

==== 理性思考

This period saw the birth of science and philosophy because for the first time people critically examined the natural world and subjected religious beliefs to reason.

这一时期见证了科学和哲学的诞生，因为人们第一次批判性地审视自然世界，并将宗教信仰置于理性 之下。


'''

==== 逻辑学

Philosophers questioned not only the traditional views of the gods but also traditional values. Some of this questioning came from the sophists (“wise ones”) of Athens, those with a reputation for learning, wisdom, and skillful deployment of rhetoric. Sophists emerged as an important presence in the democratic world of Athens beginning in the mid-fourth century BCE. They claimed to be able to teach anyone rhetoric, or the art of persuasion, for a fee, as a means to achieve success as a lawyer or a politician. Others worried that speakers thus trained could lead the people to act against their own self-interest.

哲学家不仅质疑传统的神的观点，也质疑传统的价值观。其中一些质疑来自雅典的智者（“智者”），他 们以博学、智慧和巧妙运用修辞而闻名。从公元前四世纪中叶开始，诡辩家成为雅典民主世界的重要 组成部分。他们声称可以付费教授任何人修辞学或说服的艺术，作为律师或政治家取得成功的手段。 其他人担心经过如此训练的演讲者可能会导致人们做出违 背自身利益的行为。

|苏格拉底
|Many thought Socrates was one of the sophists. Socrates publicly questioned sophists and politicians about good and evil, right and wrong. He wanted to base values on reason instead of on unchallenged traditional beliefs. In 399 BCE, an Athenian jury court found Socrates guilty of impiety and corrupting the youth, and he was sentenced to death.

许多人认为苏格拉底是诡辩家之一。他公开质疑智者和政治家的善与恶、对 与错。他希望将价值观建立在理性之上，而不是建立在无可争议的传统信仰之上。公元前399年，雅典陪审法庭判定苏格拉底犯有不敬虔和败坏青少年罪，并被判处死刑.

|柏拉图
|Socrates left behind no writings of his own, but some of his disciples wrote about him. One of these was Plato, who wrote dialogues that featured Socrates in conversation with others. Through these dialogues, Plato constructed a philosophical system. He maintained that the material world we perceive is an illusion, a mere shadow of the real world of ideas and forms that underlie the universe. According to Plato, the true philosopher uses reason to comprehend these ideas and forms.

苏格拉底没有留下自己的著作，但他的一些弟子写了关于他的文章。其中之一是柏拉图，其中以苏格拉底与他人的对话为特色。通过这些对话， 柏拉图构建了一个哲学体系，他坚持认为，我们所感知的物质世界是一种幻觉，仅仅是宇宙背后的思想和形式的现 实世界的影子。根据柏拉图的说法，真正的哲学家使用理性来理解这些思想和形式。

|亚里士多德
| One of his most famous pupils was Aristotle, who came to disagree with his teacher and believed that ideas and forms could not exist independently of the material universe.

他(指柏拉图)最 著名的学生之一是亚里士多德，他不同意他的老师的观点，认为思想和形式不能独立于物质宇宙而存 在。
|===

Modern historians view Plato and Aristotle as the founders of Western (European) philosophy.

现代历史学家将柏拉图和亚里士多德视为西方（欧洲）哲学的创始人.

==== 剧作

Playwrights of the fifth century BCE composed tragedies that featured music and dance. The plots were based on traditional myths about gods and heroes, but through their characters the playwrights pondered philosophical questions of the day that have remained influential over time. For example, Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus, must decide whether to obey the laws or follow her religious beliefs.

公元前五世纪的剧作家，创作了以 音乐和舞蹈为特色的悲剧. 这些情节基于有关神和英雄的 传统神话，但剧作家通过他们的角色思考了当时的哲学问题，这些问题随着时间的推移仍然具有影响 力。例如，(某剧作中,) 俄狄浦斯的女儿安提戈涅必须决定是遵守法律还是遵循 她的宗教信仰。

'''

==== 历史研究

Herodotus and Thucydides are considered the first true historians because they examined the past to rationally explain the causes and effects of human actions.

希罗多德和修昔底德被认为是第一批真正的历史学家，因为他们审 视过去，理性地解释人类行为的原因和影响。

'''

==== 艺术

In the Classical period, Greek artists thus came into their own and no longer borrowed heavily from the art of Egypt and Phoenicia.

在古典时期，希腊艺术家因此形成了自己的风格，不再大量借鉴埃及和腓尼基的艺术。


'''

=== 古希腊的城邦

Each polis had its own government and religious cults, and each built monumental temples for the gods. The most famous of their sacred sites were Delphi, near Mount Parnassus in central Greece and seat of the oracle of Apollo, the god of prophecy, and Olympia in southern Greece, sacred to Zeus, who ruled the pantheon of gods at Mount Olympus.

每个城邦都有 自己的政府和宗教崇拜，并且每个城邦都为众神建造了巨大的神庙. 他们最著名的圣地是德尔斐（Delphi），位于希腊 中部的帕纳索斯山（Mount Parnassus）附近，是预言之神阿波罗（Apollo）的神谕所在地；以及位于 希腊南部的奥林匹亚（Olympia） ，是宙斯的圣地.

As the population expanded during the Archaic period, a shortage of farmland brought dramatic changes. Many Greeks in search of land to farm left their homes and founded colonies. The largest number were on the island of Sicily and in southern Italy, the region the Greeks referred to as Magna Graecia or “Greater Greece.” When Greeks established a colony, it became an independent polis with its own laws.

随着人口的增长，耕地的短缺带来了巨大的变化。许多寻找土地耕种的希腊人离开家园，(去往其他地方)建立 了殖民地。数量最多的是西西里岛和意大利南部，希腊人称该地区为大希腊或“大希腊”。当希腊人建立 殖民地时，它就成为一个拥有自己法律的独立城邦。

=== 古希腊发展与灭亡框架

This era, from 800 to 500 BCE, is called Archaic Greece after arche, Greek for “beginning.”

这个时期从公元前 800 年到公元前 500 年，被称为“古希 腊” ，源自希腊语“arche ”，意为“开始”。

The eighth century BCE was also the period in which the epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed. Historians agree the epics originated in the songs of oral poets in the Greek Dark Ages. In the eighth century BCE, using the Greek alphabet, scribes wrote these stories down for the first time.

公元前八世纪也是史诗《伊利亚特》和《奥德赛》的创作时期，历史学家一致认为史诗起源于希腊黑暗时代口头 诗人的歌曲。公元前八世纪，抄写员首次使用希腊字母写下这些故事。

|起因
|The Persian Wars (492–449 BCE) were a struggle between the Greek city-states and the expanding Persian Empire. In the mid-sixth century BCE, during the reign of Cyrus the Great, Persian armies subdued the Greek city-states of Ionia. The resident Greeks were unhappy with the tyrants’ rule, and in 499 BCE they rose in the Ionian Rebellion, joined by Athens and the Greek cities on the island of Cyprus. The Persian king Darius decided that Athens must be punished.

公元前六 世纪中叶，(波斯)居鲁士大帝统治时期，波斯军队征服了希 腊城邦爱奥尼亚.当地的希 腊人对暴君的统治感到不满，于公元前 499 年发动了爱奥尼亚叛乱，雅典和塞浦路斯岛上的希腊城市 也加入了这场叛乱。波斯国王大流士决定必须惩罚雅典。

==== 伯罗奔尼撒战争 (前431年)


By the late sixth century BCE, Sparta had become the most powerful state in the Peloponnese. Sparta also organized the city-states of this region and parts beyond into a system of alliances that historians refer to as the Peloponnesian League. Its members still had self-government and paid no tribute to Sparta.

到公元前六世纪末，斯巴达成为伯罗奔尼撒半岛最强大的 国家。斯巴达还将该地区及周边地区的城邦组织成一个联盟体系，历史学家称之为伯罗奔尼撒联盟。 其成员仍然拥有自治权，并且不向斯巴达进贡.

In 477 BCE, they organized an alliance of Greek city-states known today as the Delian League, headquartered on the Aegean island of Delos. Over time, it became clear to the other Greeks that the Delian League was no longer an alliance but an empire in which the subject city-states paid a steady flow of tribute.

公元前477年，他们组织了希腊城邦 联盟，即今天的提洛联盟，总部设在爱琴海的提洛岛。随着时间的推移，其他希腊人逐渐 认识到，提洛联盟不再是一个联盟，而是一个帝国，附属城邦不断向其中纳贡。

The rivalry between the two city-states eventually led them into open conflict. Thus, in 431 BCE, the Peloponnesian War began. In 421 BCE, after ten years of war, the Spartans and Athenians agreed to the Peace of Nicias.

两个城邦 之间的竞争最终导致他们陷入公开冲突。公元前431年，伯罗奔尼撒战争开始了. 公元前421年，经过十年的战争，斯巴达人和雅典人达成了《尼西亚斯和约》.

==== 希腊化时期（公元前 323-31 年）

The Classical period in Greece ended when Greece lost its freedom to the Kingdom of Macedon and Macedon’s king Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire. The period that followed Alexander’s death is known as the Hellenistic period (323–31 BCE). Alexander’s empire was divided among his top generals. During this time, the resulting mixture of cultures was neither Greek nor non-Greek but “Greek-like,” or Hellenistic, a term that refers to the flourishing and expansion of Greek language and culture throughout the Mediterranean and Near East during this period.

当希腊因马其顿王国失去自由而马其顿国王亚历山大大帝征服波斯帝国时，希腊的古典时期结束了。 亚历山大死后的时期被称为希腊化时期（公元前 323-31 年）。亚历山大的帝国被他的高级将领瓜分. 在此期间，由此产生的文化混合物既不是希腊文化，也不是非希腊文化，而是“类希腊”或“希腊化”，这个 术语指的是这一时期希腊语言和文化在整个地中海和近东地区的繁荣和扩张。
