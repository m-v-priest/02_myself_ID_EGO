==  the Roman Republic


Many elements of early Roman culture and society resulted from Greek influence on the Italian peninsula. Later, when the Roman state expanded and built an empire, its people transmitted their culture—heavily indebted to Ancient Greece—to the Celtic and Germanic tribes of central and western Europe. The classical civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome were therefore the foundation for what became known as Western civilization.

早期罗马文化和社会的许多元素都是希腊对意大利半岛的影响的结果。后来，当罗马国家扩张并建立 帝国时，其人民将他们的文化（很大程度上得益于古希腊）传播到中欧和西欧的凯尔特和日耳曼部 落。因此，古希腊和罗马的古典文明是西方文明的基础。

According to Roman tradition, the city was founded in 753 BCE by the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars, the god of war.

根据罗马传统，这座城市是由战神马尔斯的儿子罗穆卢 斯和雷穆斯双胞胎兄弟于公元前 753 年建立的.

The Roman city-state free itself from Etruscan domination and establish an independent republic around 500 BCE.

罗马城邦摆脱了伊 特鲁里亚人的统治，并在公元前 500 年左右建立了一个独立的共和国。

In the early republic, Rome was ruled by elected magistrates instead of kings, and by a Council of Elders or Senate. Roman society was divided into two classes or orders, patricians and plebeians. The patricians were the aristocratic elite, who alone could hold public office and sit in the Senate. From the beginning of the republic through the third century BCE, the plebeians, or common people, worked to achieve equality before the law in Roman society.

在共和国早期，罗马由选举产生的地方法官而不是国王统治，并由长老会或元老院统治。罗马社会分 为两个阶级或秩序：贵族和平民。贵族是贵族精英，只有他们才能担任公职并进入参议院。从共和国 初期到公元前三世纪，平民（即普通民众）致力于在罗马社会中实现法律面前人人平等。

When Rome was under threat, the plebeians could gain leverage with the patricians by refusing to fight until their demands were met. In 450 BCE, the plebeians went on strike for the first time. They feared that patrician judges were interpreting Rome’s unwritten laws to take advantage of ignorant plebeians, so they demanded the laws be written down. The patricians agreed. In the Twelve Tables, published in the Forum, Rome’s laws were written for the first time and were then accessible to all citizens.

当罗马受到威胁时，平民可以通过拒绝战斗直到贵族的要求得到满足来获得对贵族的影响 力。公元前450年，平民第一次罢工。他们担心贵族法官会解释罗马不成文的法律来利用无知的平民， 因此他们要求将这些法律写下来。贵族们同意了。在论坛上发表的《十二铜表法》中，罗马法律首次 被制定，随后可供所有公民查阅。

After 450 BCE, the plebeians met in a Plebeian Assembly that annually elected ten officials known as tribunes. These tribunes attended meetings of Rome’s assemblies, the Senate, and the law courts. If they saw any public body or official taking action that would bring harm to plebeians, they could say “Veto” or “I forbid” and stop that action. This power to veto gave plebeians a way to protect themselves and put a check on the power of patrician officials.

公元前 450 年之后，平民召开平民大会，每年选举 10 名官员，称为保民官。这些保民官出席罗马议 会、参议院和法院的会议。如果他们看到任何公共机构或官员采取会给平民带来伤害的行动，他们可 以说“否决”或“我禁止”并停止该行动。这种否决权为平民提供了一种保护自己并限制贵族官员权力的方 法。

In the fourth and third centuries BCE, plebeians won more concessions by again seceding from the patrician state. After 367 BCE, one of the two consuls, the highest officials in the republic, had to be a plebeian. After 287 BCE, the Plebeian Assembly could pass laws for the republic that were introduced to it by the tribunes, and their laws applied to all Roman citizens. By the third century BCE, the Struggle of the Orders had effectively concluded, since it was now possible for plebeians to pass laws, serve as elected officials, and sit in the Senate, equals of the patricians under Roman law. The Struggle of the Orders did not bring equality to everyone in Rome, however. Rather, it gave well-off plebeians access to positions of power.

在公元前四世纪和三世纪，平民再次脱离贵族国家，赢得了更多让步。公元前367年以后，共和国最高 官员、两位执政官中的一位必须是平民。公元前287年之后，平民议会可以通过保民官向其提交的共和 国法律，并且他们的法律适用于所有罗马公民。到公元前三世纪，骑士团的斗争实际上已经结束，因 为现在平民可以通过法律，担任民选官员，并进入元老院，与罗马法下的贵族平等。然而，骑士团的 斗争并没有给罗马的每个人带来平等。相反，它让富裕的平民获得了权力职位。

Romans were a very conservative people who greatly venerated the mos maiorum or “way of the ancestors.” Their political system was a combination of written laws and political traditions and customs that had evolved since the birth of the Republic. By the third century BCE, this system was being administrated by a combination of public assemblies, elected officials, and the Senate.

罗马人是一个非常保守的民族，非常崇敬mos maiorum或“祖先之道”。他们的政治制度是成文法律和 自共和国诞生以来不断演变的政治传统和习俗的结合。到公元前三世纪，这一制度由公共议会、民选 官员和参议院共同管理。

The Roman Republic had three main public assemblies—the Plebeian Assembly, the Tribal Assembly, and the Centuriate Assembly—that elected various officials every year. Only plebeians could attend the Plebeian Assembly, organized into thirty-five regional tribes with a single vote each. It was this assembly that annually elected the ten tribunes, who possessed veto power and could present laws to the assembly for approval. The Tribal Assembly was likewise divided into thirty-five tribes based on place of residence, with each tribe casting one vote, but both plebeians and patricians could attend. Every year, the Tribal Assembly elected the Quaestors, treasurers in charge of public money.

罗马共和国有三个主要的公共议会——平民议会、部落议会和百人议会——每年选举不同的官员。只 有平民才能参加平民大会，该大会分为三十五个地区部落，每个部落有一票。这个议会每年选举十名 保民官，他们拥有否决权，可以向议会提出法律供批准。部落会议同样根据居住地分为三十五个部 落，每个部落投一票，但平民和贵族都可以参加。部落议会每年都会选出财务官，即负责公共资金的 财务主管。

Only the Centuriate Assembly could declare war, though the Senate remained in control of foreign policy. Both plebeians and patricians could attend this assembly, which was organized into blocs. The number of votes assigned to each bloc was based on the number of centuries—meaning a group of one hundred men in a military unit—that bloc could afford to equip with weapons and armor. Wealthier citizens had more votes because they could pay more to support the military. This assembly also elected military commanders, judges, and the censor, whose main task was to conduct the census to assess the wealth of Rome’s citizens.

尽管元老院仍然控制着外交政策，但只有百人会议才能宣战。平民和贵族都可以参加这个以集团形式 组织的集会。分配给每个集团的票数是根据该集团能够负担得起装备武器和盔甲的世纪数（即一个军 事单位中一百人的团体）而定的。富裕的公民拥有更多选票，因为他们可以支付更多费用来支持军 队。该议会还选举了军事指挥官、法官和监察员，其主要任务是进行人口普查以评估罗马公民的财 富。

All elected officials joined the Roman Senate as members for life after their term in office. By far the most powerful institution in the Roman state, the Senate decided how public money was to be spent and advised elected officials on their course of action. Elected officials rarely ignored the Senate’s advice since many of them would be senators themselves after leaving office.

所有当选官员在任期结束后都将成为罗马元老院的终身成员。迄今为止，元老院是罗马国家最强大的 机构，负责决定公共资金的使用方式，并就民选官员的行动方案提供建议。当选官员很少忽视参议院 的建议，因为他们中的许多人在卸任后自己也会成为参议员。

The patron-client system was another important element in the Roman political system. A patron was usually a wealthy citizen who provided legal and financial assistance to his clients, who were normally less affluent citizens. In return, clients in the Roman assemblies voted as directed by their patrons. Patrons could inherit clients, and those with many wielded great influence in Rome.

庇护-附庸制度是罗马政治制度的另一个重要组成部分。赞助人通常是富裕的公民，为他的客户提供法 律和财务援助，而客户通常是不太富裕的公民。作为回报，罗马议会中的客户按照其赞助人的指示进 行投票 (相当于买选票)。赞助人可以继承客户，而那些拥有众多权力的人在罗马拥有巨大的影响力。

The early Romans did not plan on building an immense empire. They were surrounded by hostile city-states and tribes, and in the process of defeating them they made new enemies even as they expanded their network of allies. Thus they were constantly sending armies farther afield to crush these threats until Rome emerged in the second century BCE as the most powerful state in all the lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

早期的罗马人并不打算建立一个庞大的帝国。他们被敌对的城邦和部落所包围，在击败他们的过程 中，他们在扩大盟友网络的同时也结下了新的敌人。因此，他们不断向更远的地方派遣军队来粉碎这 些威胁，直到罗马在公元前二世纪成为地中海沿岸所有土地上最强大的国家。

The Roman Senate developed certain policies in conducting wars that proved quite successful. One was to divide and conquer. The Romans always tried to defeat one enemy at a time and avoid waging war against a coalition. Thus they often attempted to turn their enemies against each other. Another tactic was to negotiate from strength. Even after suffering enormous defeats in battle, Rome would continue a war until it won a major engagement and reach a position from which to negotiate for peace with momentum on its side. Yet another successful strategy was to establish colonies in recently conquered lands to serve as the first line of defense if a region revolted against Rome. Well-constructed roads were also built to link Rome to these colonies, so armies could arrive quickly in a region that rebelled. Thanks to these networks across Italy, the language and culture of Rome eventually spread throughout its empire as well. Romans also transformed former enemies into loyal allies who could enjoy self-government as long as they honored Rome’s other alliances and provided troops in times of war. Some even received Roman citizenship.

罗马元老院制定了一些战争政策，事实证明这些政策相当成功。一是分而治之。罗马人总 是试图一次击败一个敌人，并避免与联盟发动战争。因此，他们经常试图让敌人互相攻击。另一种策 略是通过实力进行谈判。即使在战斗中遭受巨大失败，罗马仍会继续战争，直到赢得一场重大交战， 并占据有利地位进行和平谈判。另一个成功的策略是在最近被征服的土地上建立殖民地，作为某个地 区反抗罗马的第一道防线。还修建了修建良好的道路将罗马与这些殖民地连接起来，这样军队就可以 迅速到达叛乱地区。由于这些遍布意大利的网络，罗马的语言和文化最终也传播到了整个帝国。罗马 人还将昔日的敌人变成了忠诚的盟友，只要他们尊重罗马的其他联盟并在战争时期提供军队，就可以 享受自治。有些人甚至获得了罗马公民身份。

After conquering most of the Italian peninsula, Rome came to challenge the other major power in the region, Carthage. A series of wars ensued, called the Punic Wars, in which Rome and Carthage vied for dominance. the First Punic War (264–241 BCE) ended with Rome annexing Sicily.

在征服了意大利半岛的大部分地区之后，罗马开始挑战该地区的另一个强国迦太基。随后发生了一系 列战争，称为布匿战争，罗马和迦太基争夺统治地位。第一次布匿战争（公元前 264-241 年），战争以罗马吞并西西里岛而结束。

Carthage desired revenge. In the Second Punic War (218–201 BCE), As the Carthaginian general Hannibal’s army was rampaging through Italy, Rome sent an army across the Mediterranean to Africa to attack Carthage, which summoned Hannibal back to defend his homeland.

迦太基渴望复仇。在第二次布匿战争（公元前 218-201 年）中，迦太基将军汉尼拔, 当他的军队横行意大利时，罗 马派遣军队穿越地中海前往非洲进攻迦太基，迦太基召唤汉尼拔回来保卫家园.

Carthage sued for peace and was stripped of all its overseas territory. Rome thus acquired Carthage’s lands in Hispania.

迦太基求和，被剥夺了所有海外领土。罗马因此获得了迦太基在西班牙的土地。

During the war, King Philip V of Macedon made an alliance with Carthage. After Rome’s victory against Carthage, Rome declared war against this new enemy. Philip suffered a defeat and lacked the resources to continue. Consequently, he agreed to become an ally of Rome. Rome also liberated all regions in Greece formerly under Macedonian control.

战争期间，马其顿国王菲利普五世与迦太基结盟。 罗马战胜迦太基后，罗马向这个新敌人宣战。腓力遭受了失败，并且缺乏继续作战的资源。因此，他同 意成为罗马的盟友。罗马还解放了以前受马其顿控制的希腊所有地区。

Rome discovered in the second century BCE that there was no end to the threats from hostile powers. Perseus, the son of Philip V, renounced the alliance with Rome. Roman armies invaded Macedon, which soon afterward became a Roman province.
When the Achaean League in the Peloponnese in Greece challenged Roman control of Greece and Macedon, Rome declared war and sacked Corinth, the League’s largest city.
Roman armies also destroyed the city of Carthage in the Third Punic War.
After 146 BCE, no power remained in the Mediterranean that could challenge Rome

罗马在公元前二世纪发现敌对势力的威胁永无止境。腓力五世的儿子珀尔修斯放弃了与罗马的联盟。罗马军队入侵马其顿，罗马随后解散了马其顿的君主制，马其顿很快成为罗马的一个省. 当希腊伯罗奔尼撒半岛的亚该亚同盟挑战罗马对希腊和马其顿的控制时，罗马洗劫了该同盟最大的城市科林斯。罗马军队还在第三次布匿战争中摧毁了 迦太基城. 公元前146年之后，地中海地区不再有任何力量可以 挑战罗马.

Rome’s constant wars and conquests in the third and second centuries BCE created a host of social, economic, and political problems for the republic.

罗马在公元前三世纪和二世纪持续不断的战争和征服给共和国带来了一系列社会、经济和政治问题。

A number of factors contributed to these problems and transformations. From the foundation of the republic, most Roman citizens had owned and operated small family farms. Indeed, to serve as Roman soldiers, men had to own property. However, the Punic Wars had strained this traditional system. Roman soldiers were often away from home for long periods of time, leaving the women and children to maintain their holdings. When they ultimately did return, many found their property in another’s hands. Others decided to sell their neglected farms and move their families to the expanding city of Rome, where they joined the growing ranks of the landless working class known as the proletariat. By the first century BCE, the population of the city of Rome may have exceeded one million.

从共和国成立以来，大多数罗马公民都拥有并经营小型家庭农场。 事实上，要成为罗马士兵，男人必须拥有财产。然而，布匿战争使这一传统体系不堪重负。罗马士兵 经常长时间离开家，留下妇女和儿童来维持他们的财产。当他们最终返回时，许多人发现自己的财产 落入他人手中。其他人则决定出售他们被忽视的农场，并举家搬到不断扩张的罗马城，在那里他们加 入了不断壮大的无土地工人阶级（即无产阶级）的行列。到公元前一世纪，罗马城的人口可能已超过 一百万。

The traditional patron-client system collapsed, since landless Romans didn’t need the assistance of patrons to settle property disputes. Politicians therefore had to win the support of the urban masses with free food and entertainment, such as gladiatorial combats, and promises to create jobs through public works projects. Some even organized the poor into violent gangs to frighten their political rivals.

传统的赞助人-客户体系崩溃了，因为 没有土地的罗马人不需要赞助人的帮助来解决财产纠纷。因此，政治家必须通过免费食物和娱乐（例 如角斗）来赢得城市群众的支持，并承诺通过公共工程项目创造就业机会。有些人甚至将穷人组织成 暴力团伙，以恐吓他们的政治对手。

罗马人民对元老院和贵族精英的领导越来越不满，他们越来越指望强大的军事领导人来解决问题。(民众开始走极端，他们选择了军事独裁, 取代了民主共和政体)

The Roman people grew dissatisfied with the leadership of the Senate and the aristocratic elite, and they increasingly looked to strong military leaders to address the problems.

These problems also presaged the political transformations Rome was to suffer through in the following decades. Between 60 BCE and 31 BCE, a string of powerful military leaders took the stage and bent the Republic to their will. In their struggle for power, Rome descended further into civil war and disorder. By 27 BCE, only one leader remained. Under his powerful hand, the Republic became a mere façade for the emergent Roman Empire.

这些问题也预示着罗马将在接下来的几十年中经历政治变革。公元前 60 年至公元前 31 年间，一系列强大的军事领导人登上舞台，让共和国屈服于他们的意志。在权力斗争中，，罗马进一 步陷入内战和混乱。到公元前 27 年，只剩下一位领导人。在他的大权之下，共和国变成了新兴罗马帝 国的一个幌子。

Three men in particular eventually assumed enormous dominance. One was Pompey Magnus. Another politician and military commander of this era was Crassus. The third influential figure was Julius Caesar.

The optimates in the Senate distrusted all these men and cooperated to block their influence in Roman politics. In response, in 60 BCE the three decided to join forces to advance their interests though a political alliance known to history as the First Triumvirate (“rule by three men”). But they were all very ambitious and each greatly distrusted the others.

特别是三个人最终取得了巨大的统治地位。其中之一是庞培·马格努 斯. 这个时代的另一位政治家和军事统帅是克拉苏。第三位有影响力的人物是 尤利乌斯·凯撒.

元老院的元老们不信任所有这些人，并合作阻止他们对罗马政治的影响。作为回应，公元前 60 年，三 人决定联合起来，通过历史上称为“第一三头政治”（“三人统治”）的政治联盟来推进各自的利益。但他们都雄心勃勃，而且彼此都非常不信任。

After serving as consul in 60 BCE, Julius Caesar took command of the Roman army in Gaul (modern France). Over the next ten years, his armies conquered all Gaul and launched attacks against German tribes across the Rhine, and on the island of Britain across the English Channel.

公元前 60 年担任执政官后，朱利叶斯·凯撒指挥了高卢（现代法国）的罗马军队。在接下来的十年里，他的军 队征服了整个高卢，并对莱茵河对岸的日耳曼部落和英吉利海峡对岸的不列颠岛发起进攻。

image:/img/0011.jpg[,100%]




The Roman people were awed by Caesar’s military success, and Pompey and Crassus grew jealous of his popularity. In 54 BCE, Crassus invaded the Parthian Kingdom in central Asia, hoping for similar military and political triumphs. The invasion was a disaster, however, and Crassus was captured by the Parthians and executed.

罗马人民 对凯撒的军事成就感到敬畏，而庞培和克拉苏则对他的受欢迎程度感到嫉妒。公元前 54 年，克拉苏入 侵中亚的帕提亚王国，希望获得类似的军事和政治胜利。然而，这次入侵是一场灾难，克拉苏被帕提 亚人俘虏并处决。

After Crassus’s death, Pompey decided to break with Caesar and support his old enemies the optimates. In 49 BCE, the optimates and Pompey controlled the Senate and demanded that Caesar disband his army in Gaul and return to Rome to stand trial on various charges. Instead, Caesar convinced his client army to march on Rome. In January of that year he famously led his troops across the Rubicon River, the traditional boundary between Italy and Gaul. Since Caesar knew this move would trigger war, as it was illegal to bring a private army into Rome proper, the phrase “crossing the Rubicon” continues to mean “passing the point of no return.” In 48 BCE, Caesar defeated Pompey.

克拉苏死后，庞培决定与凯撒决 裂，转而支持他的宿敌优化派。公元前49年，元老院和庞培控制了元老院，要求凯撒解散他在高卢的 军队，并返回罗马接受各种指控的审判。相反，凯撒说服他的客户军队向罗马进军。那年一月，他率 领部队越过卢比孔河，这是意大利和高卢之间的传统边界。由于凯撒知道此举会引发战争，因为将私 人军队带入罗马本土是非法的，因此“跨越卢比孔河”一词仍然意味着“越过不归路”。公元前48年，凯撒击败了庞培。

To prosecute the war against Pompey, Caesar had himself appointed dictator in 48 BCE. Despite the tradition that dictatorship was to be temporary, Caesar’s position was indefinite. In 46 BCE, he was appointed dictator for a term of ten years, and in 44 BCE his dictatorship was made permanent, or for life. These appointments and other efforts to accumulate power unnerved many Romans, who had a deep and abiding distrust of autocratic rulers. Caesar had hoped to win over his former enemies by inviting them to serve again in the Senate and appointing them to positions in his government. However, these former optimates viewed him as a tyrant, and in 44 BCE two of them, Brutus and Cassius, led a conspiracy that resulted in his assassination.

为了对庞培发动战争，凯撒于公元前 48 年任命自己为独裁者。尽管传统上认为独裁统治是暂时的，但 凯撒的地位却是无限期的。公元前 46 年，他被任命为独裁者，任期十年，并于公元前 44 年，他的独 裁统治成为永久性的，即终身独裁。这些任命和其他积累权力的努力让许多罗马人感到不安，他们对 独裁统治者抱有深深而持久的不信任. 凯撒曾希望通过 邀请他们再次在元老院任职并任命他们在政府中担任职务来赢得他以前的敌人的支持。然而，这些前 优化者将他视为暴君，公元前 44 年，其中两人布鲁图斯和卡西乌斯领导了一场阴谋，导致他被暗杀。

From Republic to Principate

从共和制到元首制

Octavian was only eighteen when Caesar was killed, but as Caesar’s adopted son and heir he enjoyed the loyalty and political support of Caesar’s military veterans. Together these three shared the power of dictator in Rome in a political arrangement known as the Second Triumvirate. Unlike the First Triumvirate, which was effectively a conspiracy, the Second Triumvirate was formally recognized by the Senate.

凯撒被杀时，屋大维只有十八岁，但作为凯撒的养子和继承人，他享有凯撒退伍军人的忠诚和政治支 持。屋大维与两位经验丰富的将军和政治家马克·安东尼和雷必达联手，他们都是凯撒的 忠实支持者。这三个人在被称为“第二三头政治”的政治安排中共同分享罗马独裁者的权力。与实际上是阴 谋的第一三巨头不同，第二三巨头得到了参议院的正式承认。

After crushing the remnants of the optimates, the three men divided the Roman Empire between them. Soon they quarreled, however, and civil war erupted once again.

在粉碎了优等派的残余势力后，这三个人瓜分了罗马帝国. 然而 很快他们就发生了争吵，内战再次爆发。

To avoid the fate of his adopted father, he successfully maintained a façade that the Roman Republic was alive and well. Octavian, traditionally referred to as Augustus after 27 BCE, had assumed enormous power. Despite his claim that he had restored the Republic, he had in fact inaugurated the Empire.

为了避免 重蹈养父的覆辙，他成功地维持了罗马共和国还活着、运转良好的假象. 屋大维（传统上在 公元前 27 年之后被称为奥古斯都）已经掌握了巨大的权力。尽管他声称自己恢复了共和国，但实际上 他开创了帝国.

Augustus was keenly aware that the peace and prosperity he had created was largely built upon his image and power, and he feared what might happen when he died. As a result, the last few decades of his life were spent arranging for a political successor. This was a complicated matter since there was neither an official position of emperor nor a republican tradition of hereditary rule. Augustus had no son of his own, and his attempts to groom others to take control were repeatedly frustrated when his proposed successors died before him. Before his own death in 14 CE, Augustus arranged for his stepson Tiberius to receive from the Senate the power of a proconsul and a tribune. While not his first choice, Tiberius was an accomplished military leader with senatorial support.

奥古斯都敏锐地意识到，他所创造的和平与繁荣很大程度上是建立在他的形象和权力之上的，他担心 自己死后会发生什么。结果，他生命的最后几十年都花在了安排政治继任者上。这是一个复杂的问 题，因为既没有皇帝的官方职位，也没有世袭统治的共和传统。奥古斯都没有自己的儿子，当他提议 的继任者先于他去世时，他培养其他人掌权的尝试屡屡受挫。公元14年奥古斯都去世前，他安排他的 继子提比略从元老院获得总督和保民官的权力。提比略虽然不是他的第一选择，但他是一位有成就的 军事领袖，得到了元老院的支持。

Problems with imperial inheritance remained. There were always risks that a hereditary ruler might prove incompetent.

但帝国继承问题仍然存在。世袭统治者无能的风险始终存在。(人治的国家, 非民主选举的国家, 如中国, 皇帝的好坏纯粹是听天由命)

Gladiatorial matches…​ These epic games (and the distribution of free wheat) were meant to distract the people from potential weaknesses in Roman governance. The idea was that those whose immediate needs were being met with food and entertainment were less likely to notice social inequality, become discontented, or foment rebellion.

(角斗比赛,) 这些史诗般的游戏（以及免费小麦的分配）旨在分散人们 对罗马治理中潜在弱点的注意力。这个想法是，那些直接需要食物和娱乐来满足的人不太可能注意到 社会不平等、变得不满或煽动叛乱。

Sea routes facilitated the movement of goods around the empire. Though the Romans built up a strong network of roads, shipping by sea was considerably less expensive. Thus, access to a seaport was crucial to trade. In Italy, there were several fine seaports, with the city of Rome’s port at Ostia being a notable example.

海上航线促进了帝国周围的货物流动。尽管罗马人建立了强大的道路网络，但海上运输的成本要低得 多。因此，进入海港对于贸易至关重要。在意大利，有几个优秀的海港，罗马市的奥斯蒂亚港就是一 个著名的例子.

Taxes fell into several categories, including those calculated with census lists in the provinces, import and customs taxes, and taxes levied on particular groups and communities.

税收分为几 类，包括根据各省人口普查清单计算的税收、进口税和关税以及对特定群体和社区征收的税收。

Despite these attempts at collecting taxes, by the third century CE the empire had entered a period of financial crisis. Constant wars meant a never-ending need to sustain large armies. As less new land was acquired, troop payments came more often from the central treasury than from newly conquered territory.

尽管有这些收税的尝试，但到了公元三世纪，帝国还是进入了金融危机时期。持续不断的战争意味着 永远需要维持庞大的军队。由于获得的新土地减少，部队付款更多地来自中央财政部，而不是来自新 征服的领土。

In early Rome, the army was a volunteer force mustered during times of conflict. By the time of the empire, however, it had become a standing professionalized force. Soldiers served a sixteen-year term, though this was later raised to twenty, and they were paid a set amount at the end of their service.

在早期的罗马，军队是在冲突时期召集起来的志愿部队。然而，到了帝国时代，它已经成为一支常备 的专业化力量。士兵的服役期限为十六年，后 来提高到二十年，并且在服役结束时获得一定数额的报酬。

While earlier in its history, Rome’s soldiers might expect to campaign only part of the year, by the imperial period, conflict had become a regular situation on the frontier. In some situations wars may have seemed endless. There were clearly societal disadvantages to continuous conflict. Conflict abroad disrupted regional markets that Italy depended on.

虽 然在其历史早期，罗马士兵可能只在一年中的部分时间进行征战，但到了帝国时期，冲突已成为边境 的常见情况。战役可能会持续数月，在某些情况下，战争似乎永无休止。持续的冲突显然对社会不利。国外冲突扰乱了意大利所依赖的区域市场

In the first century CE, Christians joined this landscape. Christians generally disapproved of animal sacrifice and worship of the emperor.

公元一世纪，基督徒加入了这片土地. 基督徒普遍不赞成动物祭祀和崇拜皇帝。

Official Roman attitudes to the Jewish people were not consistently hostile, and the Jewish view of Roman treatment also varied depending on the political and cultural climate.

罗马官方对犹太人的态度并不总是敌对的，犹太人对罗马待遇的看法也因政治和文化气候而异。

The Roman Empire was divided into administrative units called provinces. A province was governed by a magistrate chosen by the Senate or personally by the emperor. The term for governing a senatorial province was one year, while that for administering an imperial province was indefinite. Provincial governors had imperium, or jurisdiction over a territory or military legion. They were also relatively autonomous in managing their territory.

罗马帝国被划分为多个称为行省的行政单位. 一个省由元老院或皇帝亲自选出的治安法官管辖。元老省的执政期限为一年，而帝国省的执政期 限则无限期。省长对领土或军团拥有统治权或管辖权。他们在管理领土方面也具有相对自主权，

Romans carried on a perpetual debate about citizenship, or civitas, and whether to extend its benefits to different groups. To gain civitas at birth, a person needed to be the child of two citizens. Citizenship conferred voting rights, the right to perform military service, the right to run for public office, and certain marriage and property rights, among others. The extent to which non-Romans were barred from enjoying these rights was not always clear.

罗马人还就公民权（ civitas ）以及是否 将其福利扩展到不同群体进行了持续不断的辩论。为了在出生时获得公民身份，一个人必须是两个公 民的孩子。公民身份赋予投票权、服兵役的权利、竞选公职的权利以及某些婚姻和财产权等。非罗马 人在多大程度上被禁止享有这些权利并不总是清楚的

The empire shifted its focus eastward, a trend signaled most prominently by its reorientation around its new capital in Constantinople (today’s Istanbul). The Roman Empire’s eastward shift epitomized the major cultural changes occurring during this period. Because of these shifts, Late Antiquity has been characterized as a transitional period between the ancient and medieval worlds that occurred from roughly 150 to 750 CE.

帝国将其重心向东转移，这一趋势最明显的标志是它围绕新首都君士坦丁堡（今天的伊斯坦布尔）进 行的重新定位。罗马帝国的东移集中体现了这一时期发生的重大文化变革。由于这些转变，古代晚期被描述为古代世 界和中世纪世界之间的过渡时期，大约发生在公元 150 年至 750 年。

The third century was a period of upheaval and change for the Roman government, often referred to as the Crisis of the Third Century. From 235 to 284, a span of only forty-nine years, the empire was ruled by upward of twenty-six different claimants to the imperial throne. New emperors were often declared and supported by Roman soldiers. As a result, civil wars—as well as wars on the eastern frontier—were nearly constant.

三世纪是罗马政府的动荡和变革时期，通常被称为三世纪危机。从公元235年到公元284年，仅仅四十 九年的时间里，帝国就被多达二十六个不同的皇位继承者统治着。新皇帝常常得到罗马士兵的宣布和 支持。结果，内战以及东部边境的战争几乎持续不断。

Constantine had effectively ushered in a new era of Christian governance. Rulers for the rest of the empire’s history were explicitly Christian, acting as de facto heads of the church and controlling church policy.

君士坦丁实 际上开创了基督教统治的新时代。帝国其他历史时期的统治者都是明确的基督教徒，他们充当事实上 的教会领袖并控制教会政策。

But while the emperors self-styled themselves as priestly rulers, the bishops sometimes contested this role, and emperors then had to compete with them for religious authority.

但是，虽然皇帝自称为祭司统治者，但主教有时会质疑这一角 色，皇帝就不得不与他们争夺宗教权威。

Germanic Kingdoms. The increasing influx of Germanic peoples into the western empire brought about a fracturing of Roman power as a series of independent kingdoms took control of the Italian peninsula.

日耳曼王国。随着一系列独立王国控制了意大利半岛、高卢（今法国和比利时）、伊比利亚半岛和北非，日耳曼民族不断涌入西 罗马帝国，导致罗马权力瓦解。

Many of the migrations of Germanic peoples during this period were a result of the influx of the Huns. A nomadic group originating in the Eurasian Steppe, the Huns made their way west from central Asia toward Europe around 450. As they reached the edge of Europe, they conquered and occupied the frontiers of the Roman Empire, placing pressure on groups already there to move into the continent’s interior. These migrations eventually pushed Germanic groups and others into Roman territory. The Huns were led by their ruler Atilla. Reaching as far as Gaul, the Hun Empire ultimately collapsed due to Atilla’s death in 454.

这一时期日耳曼民族的许多迁徙都是匈奴人涌入的结果。匈奴人是一个起源于欧亚草原的游牧民族， 大约在 450 年从中亚向西进入欧洲。当他们到达欧洲边缘时，他们征服并占领了罗马帝国的边境，给 已经在那里的民族带来了迁徙的压力。进入大陆内部。这些迁徙最终将日耳曼群体和其他群体推入罗 马领土。匈奴人由他们的统治者阿提拉领导. 匈奴帝国远至 高卢，最终因阿提拉于 454 年去世而崩溃。

Other migratory groups during this period settled in Gaul, including the Franks. A one-time ally of the Roman Empire, the Frankish kingdom eventually expelled the Romans and ruled the region in some form until the ninth century.

Roman troops were likewise pushed out of Britain for the final time by the invasion of Germanic peoples who included the Angles and the Saxons. Coming from modernday southern Denmark and northern Germany, they occupied southern Britain in the late fifth century. Originally two distinct groups, they are more commonly known as Anglo-Saxons, a name applied to them in the eighth century to distinguish them from similarly named Germanic groups on the European continent.

这一时期的其他移民群体在高卢定居，其中包括法兰克人。法兰克王国曾经是罗马帝国的盟友，最终 驱逐了罗马人，并以某种形式统治该地区，直到九世纪。

同样，由于包括盎格鲁人和撒克逊人在内的 日耳曼民族的入侵，罗马军队最后一次被赶出英国。他们来自现代丹麦南部和德国北部，在五世纪末 占领了英国南部。他们最初是两个不同的群体，通常被称为盎格鲁-撒克逊人，这个名称在八世纪应用 于他们，以将他们与欧洲大陆上类似名称的日耳曼群体区分开来。

Historians of Rome have debated what the fall of Rome actually means. As soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. Instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long.

罗马历史学家 一直在争论罗马的衰落到底意味着什么。一旦时间或意外除去了人造支撑物，巨大的织物就会屈 服于自身重量的压力。我们不应该探究罗马帝国为何被 毁灭，而应该惊讶于它竟然存在了这么久。

The period of Late Antiquity witnessed the height of two great competing empires. The Roman Empire morphed into the Byzantine Empire. Meanwhile, in the East, the Sasanian Empire emerged and vied with the Byzantines for supremacy.

古代晚期见证了两个伟大的相互竞争的帝国的鼎盛时期。罗马帝国演变成拜占庭帝国. 在东方，萨珊王朝崛起，并与拜占庭帝国争夺霸权。

Historians have carved out roughly 150 to 750 CE as the period of Late Antiquity and view it as a time of vibrant transformation in the Mediterranean, rather than simply Rome’s decline and fall. People from this period thought of themselves as being different from what was seen in the ancient world.

历史学家将大约公元 150 年至 750 年划定为古代晚期时期，并将其视为地中海充满活力的变革时期， 而不仅仅是罗马的衰落和衰落。这一时期的人们在某些方面认为自己与古代世界不同。

In the late 400s and early 500s, the centralization of imperial power was coupled with intense growth of the empire’s bureaucratic system. The Roman senatorial class in particular had changed. While in earlier centuries the Senate had played an important administrative role for the entire state, it now acted largely as a type of aristocratic “city council” for the city of Rome itself, making few meaningful decisions beyond city management and with many members choosing not even to attend.

在 400 年代末和 500 年代初，皇权的集 中化伴随着帝国官僚体系的迅猛发展. 罗马元老阶 层尤其发生了变化。虽然在早期的几个世纪里，元老院在整个国家中发挥着重要的行政作用，但现在 它在很大程度上充当了罗马市本身的一种贵族“市议会”的角色，除了城市管理之外，几乎没有做出任何 有意义的决定，而且许多成员选择不这样做。甚至参加。

The Sasanians ruled the area of the former classical Persian Empire, including the modern-day country of Iran.

萨珊王朝统 治着前古典波斯帝国的地区，包括现代的伊朗。

Sasanian Persia …​ At its greatest extent in the seventh century, it encroached into once-Byzantine territory through a series of conflicts. They may have been seen as particularly susceptible to Byzantine influence because Byzantine rulers claimed dominion over all Christians, including those outside their empire’s borders. 萨珊波斯, 在七世纪达到鼎盛时期，它通过一系列冲突侵入了曾经的拜 占庭领土。他们可能被认为特别容易受到拜占庭的影响，因为拜占庭统治者声称对所有基督徒 （包括帝国境外的基督徒）拥有统治权。
