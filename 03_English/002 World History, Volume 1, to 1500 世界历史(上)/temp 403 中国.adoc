Japan was not the only nation that turned inward in the seventeenth century. China did so as well.

To prevent the dangerous effect of outside
ideas and potential challenges to his rule, Hongwu decided that Chinese contact with foreign lands
would consist primarily of visits by vassals from tributary states.

In 1371, all private foreign trade was forbidden. Several years later, all
foreign trade officially came to an end when the Maritime Trade Intendancies’ offices in the port
cities of Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Quanzhou, through which all tribute goods were to flow, were
closed. Harbors were filled with rocks and wooden stakes to prevent ships from using them. Ships
were destroyed or left to rot in their docks. A shore patrol was instituted to catch anyone attempting
to engage in trade. Though the punishment was death, smugglers widely violated the rule.

日本并不是 17 世纪唯一一个转向内向的国家。中国也这样做了。为了防止外部思想的危险影响和对其统治的潜在挑
战，(明朝)洪武皇帝决定中国与外国土地的接触主要包括来自朝贡国的附庸国的访问。通过将贸易限制为贡
品交换，中国还希望向其他非常需要其产品的国家施加压力，迫使其满足其要求.  1371年，
所有私人对外贸易被禁止。几年后，随着所有贡品流通的宁波、广州和泉州等港口城市的海事局办事
处关闭，所有对外贸易正式结束。港口里堆满了岩石和木桩，以防止船只使用它们。船只被毁坏或留
在码头里腐烂。建立了海岸巡逻队来抓捕任何试图从事贸易的人。虽然刑罚是死刑，但走私者却广泛
违反了这一规定。


By cutting off access to foreign trade outside the tribute system, the Ming government greatly
reduced its tax revenue, which left it constantly short of funds. Hongwu’s reforms, which were intended to reduce the cost of government, were largely unsuccessful.

通过切断朝贡体系之外的对外贸易，明政府大大减少了税收收入，导致资金不断短缺。(明政府)为了降低政府
成本的改革基本上不成功。

Hongwu’s son, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, dispatched Zheng He, a trusted palace eunuch, on a series of six voyages throughout the Indian Ocean. The purpose of these voyages was to demonstrate the wealth and power of China by
distributing gifts to foreign rulers, thus prompting them to pledge themselves as vassals and offer
tribute to the Ming emperor.

明朝第三位皇帝永乐皇帝，1405 年至 1421 年间，他派遣一位值得信赖的宫廷太监郑和进行了六次穿越印度洋的一系列航行。这
些航海的目的是通过向外国统治者分发礼物来展示中国的财富和实力，从而促使他们臣服于明朝皇帝
并进贡。


In 1430, the Xuande Emperor, the Yongle emperor’s grandson, ordered Zheng He to undertake his
seventh and final voyage. These forays were China’s last significant effort to make contact with
overseas lands for many decades, however. Factions at court worried about the effect of outsiders
and their ideas on the empire, as well as the cost of the trips. Following Zheng He’s death, his charts
and records were destroyed, and the ships of the fleet were left to rot.

1430年，永乐皇帝的孙子宣德皇帝命令郑和进行第七次也是最后一次下西洋。然而，这些尝试是几十
年来中国与海外土地进行接触的最后一次重大努力。宫廷中的各派担心外来者及其想法对帝国的影
响，以及旅行的费用。郑和死后，他的航海图和记录被毁，船队的船只也被任其腐烂。

After the 1449 defeat of the Chinese by western Mongols (known
as the Oirat) at the Battle of Tumu, construction began on a new Great Wall to supplement the
original Great Wall.

1449 年，中国人
在图木之战中被西部蒙古人（称为卫拉特人）击败后，开始修建新的长城，以补充原来的长城


China needed money to pay for this massive project, however, as well as such other projects as the
extension of the Grand Canal to Beijing. In 1567, the Ming dynasty reversed the policy that had prohibited foreign trade, and soon
European merchant ships began arriving again.

然而，中国需要资金来支付这个庞大的项目，以及其他项目，例如将大运河延伸至北
京. 1567年，明朝扭
转了禁止对外贸易的政策，很快欧洲商船又开始抵达。

China’s economy boomed, and many Chinese peasants began to focus on producing goods for the
foreign market.  In Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province, people mass-produced porcelain.

中国经济蓬勃发展，许多中国农民开始专注于为国外市场生产商品。在江西省景德镇，人们大量生产瓷器。


The days of the Ming were numbered. The cost of supporting the imperial family had grown
astronomically.  With the imperial government lacking sufficient funds to pay the army, Chinese
soldiers were laid off. In 1627–1628, hungry, impoverished, and angry soldiers and peasants rose up
in revolt in northern China. By 1632, violence had spread to other provinces. This made it even
harder for government officials to collect taxes, which Beijing had raised in 1639, angering people
even more. In April 1644, Li Zicheng’s peasant army seized Beijing.


明朝的日子已经屈指可数了。供养皇室的成本已成天文数字(朱氏子孙吃白食的太多)。由于朝廷缺乏足够的军饷，中国士兵被解雇。
1627年至1628年，中国北方饥饿、贫困、愤怒的士兵和农民起义。到了 1632 年，暴力事件已经蔓延
到其他省份。这使得政府官员征收税收变得更加困难，而北京在1639年就提高了税收，这更加激怒了
人们。1644年4月，李自成农民军占领北京。


It was not until 1683 that all of China was brought under Manchu control.

直到1683年，全中国才被满族控制。


Local positions in government were usually given to Han Chinese
bureaucrats, but supervisory positions were given to Manchus. All males wore the distinctive Manchu hairstyle. After 1645, men who did not wear their hair in this fashion were subject to execution.

政府中的地方职位通常由汉
族官僚担任，但监督职位则由满族担任。所有男性还必须留着独特的满族发型. 1645年之后，不以这种方式留着头发的男
人会被处决。

Kangxi tolerated other religions, including
Christianity.  The Jesuits’ efforts to
learn the Chinese language and their respect for Chinese culture made them more successful at
winning converts than the Dominicans and Franciscans. But members of these other orders grew
jealous and complained to the Pope about the Jesuits’ willingness to accommodate Chinese
practices. When the Vatican ruled that all church services must be conducted in Latin and that
Chinese Christians must be ordered to abandon their ancestral rites, Kangxi decreed that
missionaries who complied would have to leave China.

康熙容忍其他宗教，包括基督教。耶稣会士学习中文的努力和对中国文化的尊重使
他们比多米尼加和方济各会更成功地赢得皈依。但其他修会的成员开始嫉妒，并向教皇抱怨耶稣会士
愿意迁就中国的做法。当梵蒂冈规定所有教堂仪式必须用拉丁语进行，并且必须命令中国基督徒放弃
祖先仪式时，康熙下令遵守的传教士必须离开中国。


Fearing that the Ming had succumbed to lax moral standards brought on by wealth and luxury, Qing
scholars returned to the teachings of Zhu Xi. Morally suspect plays and novels were banned. Female chastity was encouraged, and
so many memorial arches were erected by communities to commemorate “chaste widows,” women
who had refused to remarry after the death of their husbands.

清朝学者担心明朝已经屈服于财富和奢侈带来的道德标准松懈，于是又回归了朱熹的学说。道德
上可疑的戏剧和小说被禁止. 鼓励女性贞操，社区建立了许多纪念牌坊来纪念“贞洁寡妇”，即在丈
夫去世后拒绝再婚的妇女.


The Qing, however, continued the Ming policy of interacting with other countries as little as possible. Non-Chinese were allowed to reside in
Macao, but after 1759 they could conduct trade only through the port of Guangzhou and trade only
with the Co-hong, the official Chinese merchant guild.

然而清朝仍然延续了明朝尽可能少与其他国家交往的政策。

后，他们只能通过广州港进行贸易，并且只能与官方的中国商人行会进行贸易。



The Qing signed new
treaties with foreign nations, including the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727) with Russia, which opened
China to new European markets.

The Qing government lifted most prohibitions on trade with the
western nations. Under the Canton system, in place from 1759 to 1842, western Europeans were
permitted to trade with China if they agreed to work through the Chinese guilds that enjoyed
monopoly rights to the tea and silk trades. Under this system, all trade was confined to the southern
Chinese port of Canton (Guangzhou) in order to limit contact with Europeans and foreign influence
on China. Only members of the merchant guild authorized to transact business with Westerners
were allowed to have contact with Europeans. All Europeans trading in China were subject to
Chinese law, and they were required to live and do business in a small area outside the city walls.
Europeans were not allowed to bring firearms or warships into the port, and European women were
also prohibited from settling in Canton, which prevented a permanent European community from
taking root there.

清与俄罗斯签订的《恰克图条
约》 （1727 年），该条约为中国打开了新的欧洲市场。
清政府取消了大部分与西方国家的贸易禁令。根据1759年至1842年实行的广州体系，西欧
人如果同意通过享有茶叶和丝绸贸易垄断权的中国行会进行工作，就可以与中国进行贸易。在这种制
度下，所有贸易都仅限于中国南方的港口广州（广州），以限制与欧洲人的接触以及外国对中国的影
响。只有被授权与西方人做生意的商业行会成员才被允许与欧洲人接触。所有在中国进行贸易的欧洲
人都受到中国法律的管辖，他们被要求在城墙外的一小片区域内生活和做生意。欧洲人不得携带火器
或军舰进入港口，欧洲妇女也不得在广州定居，这阻碍了永久的欧洲共同体在那里扎根。

China rejected most European trade goods and insisted on
payment for its exports in silver. Several
million dollars’ worth of silver flowed into China each year. This encouraged European nations to find a way to chip
away at China’s trade advantages.
