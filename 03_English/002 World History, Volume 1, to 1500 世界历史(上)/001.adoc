== Causation and Interpretation in History 历史上的因果关系和解释




What is history? it is a path to knowing why we are the way we are — all our greatness, all our faults — and therefore a means for us to understand ourselves and change for the better.

什么是历史？它是一条了解我们为什么是现在这个样子的途径——我们所有的伟大，我们所有的缺点——因此也是我们了解自己并变得更好的一种手段。

But history serves this function only if it is a true reflection of the past. It cannot be a way to mask the darker parts of human nature, nor a way to justify acts of previous generations. It is the historian’s task to paint as clear a picture as sources will allow.

但历史只有真实反映过去才能发挥这一作用。它不能成为掩盖人性阴暗部分的方法，也不能成为为前几代人的行为辩护的方法。历史学家的任务是在资料来源允许的情况下描绘出尽可能清晰的图景。

Will history ever be a perfect telling of the human tale? No. There are voices we may never hear.

历史会完美地讲述人类的故事吗？不。有些声音我们可能永远听不到。

“Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” Yet because history is an everchanging collection of events influenced and shaped by a variety of causes and outcomes, it never truly repeats at all.

“不从历史中吸取教训的人注定会重蹈覆辙。”然 而，由于历史是由各种原因和结果影响和塑造的不断变化的事件的集合，因此它永远不会真正重复。

The study of history will also enhance your critical-thinking and analytical ability, both of which consistently appear among the top ten skills desired by employers (Figure 1.2). Other skills that have become increasingly important include adaptive thinking, social intelligence, cross-cultural competency, and media literacy. It also hones a creative mindset that is flexible and open to interpretations and ideas outside our own worldview.

历史研究还将增强你的批判性思维和分析能力，这两项能力一直是雇主最期望的十大技能之一。其他变得越来越重要的技能包括适应性思维、社交智力、跨文化能力和媒体素养。它还磨练了一种灵活的创造性思维，对我们自己的世界观之外的解释和想法持开放态度。

Historians must also be effective communicators. Who cares about a story nobody reads or a product nobody buys?

历史学 家还必须是有效的沟通者。谁会关心没人读的故事或没人买的产品？

This text and its assessment questions will encourage you to analyze large amounts of information, to understand a myriad of concepts, and to make connections across topics. Developing cultural awareness and empathy is also critically important. In our workplaces, in our world, we are a diverse people. Learning how to respect, communicate and collaborate with an increasingly diverse work culture is crucial to optimizing a company’s efficiency and productivity. Knowing about the world will prepare you to be a global citizen.

本文及其评估问题将鼓励您分析大量信息，理解无数概念，并建立跨主题的联系。培养文化意识和同理心也至关重要. 在我们的工作场所、我们的世界中，我们是一群多元化的人。学习如何在日益多元化的工作文化中尊重、沟通和协作对于优化公司的效率和生产力至关重要。了解世界将使你做好成为一名全球公民的准备.

It found that in times of prosperity, sentiments favoring a world community grow, while in times of strife, people tend to revert to more local, national identities.

研究发现，在繁荣时期，支持国际社会的情绪会增长，而在冲突时期，人们往 往会回归到更多的地方和国家身份。

In many ways, the idea of global citizenship emerged from the human wreckage of the two world wars. Beginning in 1948, the United Nations (UN) established a series of universal declarations that conceived of all people as deserving of human rights and dignity (Figure 1.3). Three such declarations further affirmed the rights of women (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, also known as CEDAW, 1979), of children (The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959), and of people with disabilities (The Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, 1975). The UN regularly requires that member nations report on progress in these areas.

从很多方面来说，全球公民的理念都是从两次世界大战的人类残骸中产生的。从 1948 年开始，联合国 (UN) 制定了一系列普遍宣言，认为所有人都应享有人权和尊严。三项这样的宣言进一步确 认了妇女的权利（《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》，，也称为《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》， 1979 年）、儿童的权利（《儿童权利宣言》，1959 年）和残疾人的权利（《残疾人权利宣言》， 1975 年）。联合国定期要求成员国报告这些领域的进展

You will engage with firsthand accounts of key people and events — including instances in which people’s recollections of the same events might differ.

。您将接触关键人物和事件的第一手资料，包括人们对同一事件 的回忆可能不同的情况。

Maps are some of the most contested pieces of historical evidence we have because they were almost always made from the perspective of the one making the map, not as an objective practice.

During the Age of Exploration, the Pope arbitrarily divided inhabited territory that was new to Europeans and granted it to Spain and Portugal. Centuries later, European diplomats drew lines on a map of Africa to apportion territory among colonial powers.

地图是 我们拥有的最有争议的历史证据之一，因为它们几乎总是从制作地图的人的角度制作的，而不是作为 一种客观实践。 大航海时代，教皇任意划分欧洲人陌生的居住领土，将其赐给西班牙和葡萄牙。几个世纪后, 欧洲外交官在非洲地图上划线，在殖民国家之间分配领土。

There are two main kinds of historical sources, primary and secondary. A primary source is a gateway to the past because it is an object or document that comes directly from the time period to which it refers. Primary sources might be government documents, menus from restaurants, diaries, letters, and so on.

Primary sources, when we have them, are considered more valuable than other sources because they are as close in time as we can get to the events being studied. Think, for example, of a court trial: The ideal is to have the trial quickly so that witness testimony is fresher and therefore more reliable. With the passage of time, people can forget, they might subconsciously add or take away parts of a memory, and they may be influenced to interpret events differently. A secondary source is one written or created after the fact. Good research requires both types of sources and some attention to historiography, which is the study of how other historians have already interpreted and written about the past.

历史来源主要有两种：一手的和二手的。主要来源是通往过去的门户，因为它是直接来自它所指的时 间段的对象或文档。主要来源可能是政府文件、餐馆菜单、日记、信件等。当我们拥有主要来源时，它们被认为比其他来源更有价值，因为它们与我们所研究的 事件的时间尽可能接近。以法庭审判为例：理想的情况是迅速进行审判，以便证人的证词更新鲜，因 此更可靠。随着时间的流逝，人们可能会忘记，他们可能会下意识地添加或删除部分记忆，并且可能 会受到影响以不同的方式解释事件。 二手资料是事后编写或创建的资料。好的研究需要两种类型的资料来源和对史学的关注，史学是对其他历史学家如何解释和书写过 去的研究。

History technically begins with the advent of writing. For historians, the written word is more accurate evidence for building narratives of the past. For example, imagine a modern magazine with a rock or pop star on the front, dressed for performance in a vibrant or provocative style. If that were the only piece of evidence that existed five hundred years from now, how would historians interpret our era? Without context, interpretation of the past is quite difficult. Studying artifacts is certainly worthwhile, but text offers us greater clarity. Even if the cover of the magazine bore only a caption, like “Pop star rising to the top of the charts,” future historians would have significantly more information than from the photo alone.

从技术上讲，历史始于文字的出现. 对于历史学家来说，书面文字是构建过去叙 事的更准确的证据。例如，想象一本现代杂志，封面上有一位摇滚或流行歌星，穿着充满活力或挑衅 风格的表演服装。如果这是五百年后唯一存在的证据，历史学家将如何解释我们的时代？没有背景， 解释过去是相当困难的。研究文物当然是值得的，但文本可以让我们更加清晰。即使杂志的封面上只 有一个标题，比如“流行歌星登上排行榜榜首”，未来的历史学家也将比仅从照片中获得更多的信息。

Consider the act of reading a poem. You can read the surface of a poem, the literal meaning of the words presented. But that seldom reflects the true meaning the poet meant to convey. You must also look for nuances, hidden meanings, or repeated metaphors. We approach a primary source in a similar way.

考虑读一首诗的行为。你可以阅读一首诗的表 面，即所呈现单词的字面意思。但这很少反映诗人想要传达的真正含义。你还必须寻找细微差别、隐 藏的含义或重复的隐喻。我们以类似的方式接近主要来源。

There are four key areas to consider when interpreting sources: the author, the audience, the intent, and the context. Here are some key questions to ask yourself when exploring a new source:

解释来源时需要考虑四个关键领域：作者、受众、意图和上下文。以下是探索新来源时要问自己的一 些关键问题：

1.What kind of source is it? Government documents have a different purpose than personal diaries. A former president commenting on a political issue has a different view from a comedian doing the same.

它是什么样的来源？政府文件与个人日记的用途不同。前总统对政治问题的评论与喜剧演员的观 点不同。

2.Who authored the source and why? Is the author responsible for simply recording the information, or was the author involved in the event? Is the author reliable, or does the author have an agenda?

来源的作者是谁以及为什么？作者是否只负责记录信息，或者作者是否参与了该事件？作者是否 可靠，或者作者是否有目的？

3.What is the historical context? How does the source relate to the events covered in the chapter?

历史背景是什么？来源与本章中涵盖的事件有何关系？

The internet has just as much misinformation as it has legitimate sources. Historians evaluate the strength of both primary and secondary sources, especially online. How do we decide what a good source is? It is unlikely any truly scholarly material will be found on the first page of a Google search, unless the search terms include key phrases or use targeted search engines such as Google Scholar. Online encyclopedias may be a good place to start your research, but they should be only a springboard to more refined study.

互联网 上的错误信息和合法来源一样多。历史学家评估主要和次要来源的强度，尤其是在线来源。我们如何 确定什么是好的来源？在 Google 搜索的首页上不太可能找到任何 真正的学术材料，除非搜索词包含关键短语或使用 Google Scholar 等有针对性的搜索引擎。在线百科 全书可能是开始研究的好地方，但它们应该只是更精细研究的跳板。

Sites like Wikipedia and Encyclopedia.com offer a quick view of content, but they will not give enough depth to allow for the critical thinking necessary to produce quality work. However, they are useful for introducing a topic with which you might not be familiar. They might spark new lines of inquiry, for instance, or have bibliographic information that can lead you to higher-quality material.

维基百科和 Encyclopedia.com 等网站提供了内容的快速查 看，但它们不会提供足够的深度来允许进行高质量工作所需的批判性思维。但是，它们对于介绍您可 能不熟悉的主题很有用。它们可能会激发新的探究线索，或者拥有可以引导您找到更高质量材料的书目信息。

Always make sure you can tell who is producing the website. Is it a scholar, a museum, or a research organization? If so, there is a good chance the material is sound. Is the information cited? In other words, does the source tell you where it got the information? Are those sources in turn objective and reliable? Can you corroborate the site’s information? This means doing some fact checking. You should see whether other sources present similar data and whether your source fits into the narrative developed by other scholars. Does your school library list the site as a resource?

始终确保您知道谁在制作该网站。是学者、博物馆还是研究机构？如果是这样，那么该材料很可能是 可靠的。是否引用了该信息？换句话说，消息来源是否告诉您从哪里获得信息？这些来源又客观又可 靠吗？您能证实该网站的信息吗？这意味着要进行一些事实核查。您应该看看其他来源是否提供了类 似的数据，以及您的来源是否符合其他学者提出的叙述。您的学校图书馆是否将该网站列为资源？

As you explore world history via this text, you will be asked many times to read and interpret primary sources.

当您通过本文探索世界历史时，您将被多次要求阅读和解释主要来源。

Exterior of Hagia Sophia decorated with Greek iconography. Churches at the time were meant to inspire awe; because most people could not read, stories of religious figures and events were told through highly decorative and symbolic images, and obedience and a desire to join a religious community could be motivated by the buildings’ grandeur. As you study the renderings, reflect on the following questions: What are the key features of the building? What does it make you think about? What would you think about it if you were a poor sixth-century farmer, an urban merchant of some wealth, or a foreign leader?

圣索菲亚大教堂, 装饰有希腊图 像. 当时的教堂是为了激发敬畏。由于大多数人无法阅读，宗教人物和事件的故事 是通过高度装饰性和象征性的图像来讲述的，建筑物的宏伟可以激发服从和加入宗教团体的愿望。当 您研究效果图时，请思考以下问题：建筑物的主要特征是什么？它让你想到什么？如果你是一个六世纪的贫穷农民，一个有一定财富的城市商人，或者一个外国 领导人，你会怎么想？

Textual, or written, primary sources are considered the best possible resource for historians. They tend to offer both far more context and far more information than other types of sources, and sometimes clues about the writer’s intent. But even they must be approached with method and scrutiny. We must evaluate the author, audience, intent, and context in order to accurately interpret a primary source document. Some questions you might ask about the author include the following: Who wrote the piece and what is their background? What was important to the author? Why might the author have written what they did? A deeper inspection might reveal hidden motives.

文本或书面的第一手资料被认为是历史学家最好的资源。它们往往比其他类型的来源提供更多的背景 和信息，有时还提供有关作者意图的线索。但即便如此，也必须有方法和仔细地对待它们。我们必须 评估作者、受众、意图和上下文，以便准确解释主要源文档。您可能会问有关作者的一些问题，包括 以下内容：这篇文章的作者是谁以及他们的背景是什么？对作者来说什么是重要的？为什么作者会写 出他们所做的事情？更深入的检查可能会揭示隐 藏的动机。

You must also take into account the planned audience for a document: For whom was it written? Was it meant to be public or private? Is it a letter to a friend or an essay submitted for publication?

您还必须考虑文档的计划受众：它是为谁编写的？它是公开的还是私人的？是一封写给朋友的信还是 一篇提交发表的文章？

You should think about the intent: Why was the document written? Was it intended to be a factual account of an event? Was it meant to persuade? Is it a complete falsification? Often people write things that present them in the best light rather than reveal weaknesses.

您还应该考虑意图：为什么要编写该文档？它的目的是对一个事件进行事实性的 描述吗？是为了劝说吗？这是完全的伪造吗？通常，人们写的东西都是以最好的方式展示自己，而不 是揭露弱点。

Finally, you should reflect on the circumstances of the document’s creation. What is the general time period of the document, and what was that time like? What was happening when the individual wrote the document? Was there any sort of intimidation or distress? Is it a time of war or peace? Is there religious conflict? Is there an economic crisis? A health crisis? A natural disaster? Could the writer have been fending off an attack or lobbying for one? Are we missing other perspectives or voices we would like to hear?

最后，您应该反思文档创建的情况。该文档的大致时间段是多少？那段 时间是什么样的？当个人撰写该文档时发生了什么？有没有受到任何恐吓或困扰？现在是战争时期还 是和平时期？有宗教冲突吗？有经济危机吗？健康危机？自然灾害？作者可能是在抵御攻击或游说攻 击吗？我们是否错过了我们想听到的其他观点或声音？

The answers to these questions will shape your interpretation of the primary source and bring you closer to its true meaning. Most text-based sources have meanings beyond the obvious, and it is the historian’s job to uncover these. Be sure to keep these questions in mind throughout this course and whenever you undertake historical research or are considering the accuracy of information you encounter.

这些问题的答案将影响您对主要来源的解释，并使您更接近其真正含义。大多数基于文本的资料都具 有超出显而易见的意义，历史学家的工作就是揭示这些意义。在整个课程中以及每当您进行历史研究 或考虑您遇到的信息的准确性时，请务必牢记这些问题.

- To whom is each author writing?

每个作者都在写给谁？

- How do the authors’ different intentions affect what they wrote?

作者的不同意图如何影响他们所写的内容？

- One author was on the side of the victorious and one among the vanquished. How does this context affect the tone of the writing?

一位作者站在胜利者一边，另一位则站在战败者一边。这种背景如何影响写作的基调？

The different types of language used in a source are clues to its interpretation. Linguists call the use of language rhetoric. Rhetorical choices, decisions about the way words are used and put together, are often deliberate and intended to achieve a certain outcome.

来源中使用的不同类型的语言是其解释的线索。语言学家将语言的运用称为修辞。修辞选择，即关于 词语使用和组合方式的决定，通常是经过深思熟虑的，旨在实现某种结果。

President Franklin D. Roosevelt went to Congress and asked for a declaration of war against Japan. The speech he gave, however, was about more than this request. Roosevelt used certain words to highlight that the attack was secret and calculated. He also suggested that God was on the side of the United States. As you read, pay special attention to the words Roosevelt uses. Can you pick out a few key rhetorical choices?

富兰克林·罗斯福总统前往国会要求对日本宣战。然而，他发表的讲话不仅仅涉及这 一要求。罗斯福使用了某些词语来强调这次袭击是秘密的、经过精心策划的。他还表示上帝 站在美国一边。当你阅读时，请特别注意罗斯福使用的词语。你能选出一些关键的修辞选择 吗？

One challenge is that written sources are undeniably valuable but often leave out important details. For example, many speak only of the lives of elites. It is not terribly difficult to find information about kings, queens, and other rulers of the past, but what of their families? Their servants? What of the ordinary people who lived under their rule?

一项挑战是，书面资料无疑很有价值，但往往遗漏了重要的细节。例如，许多人只谈论精英的 生活。找到有关过去国王、王后和其他统治者的信息并不困难，但他们的家人呢？他们的仆人？生活 在他们统治下的普通百姓又怎样呢？

Some groups of people remain hidden in our account of history because few records talk about their lives and experiences. Historians of the 1960s began to revolutionize the discipline by studying history “from the bottom up.” In other words, they began to focus on just those groups that had long been ignored. They used sources like church records, newspapers, and court hearings to illuminate the lives of the poor and illiterate. Court hearings were one venue in which the words of people from all backgrounds were recorded as they served as witnesses and as accused.

These kinds of sources shed light on those whose voices were rarely heard. Great strides have been made in the field of social history, which looks beyond politics to the everyday aspects of life in the past. But it remains difficult, lacking records, to represent women, the poor, and minority communities on an equal footing with those who have traditionally held power.

有些人仍然隐藏在我们的历史记录中，因为很少有记录谈论他们的生活和经历。 20 世纪 60 年代的历 史学家开始通过“自下而上”研究历史来彻底改变这一学科。换句话说，他们开始只关注那些长期被忽视 的群体。他们利用教堂记录、报纸和法庭听证会等资料来阐明穷人和文盲的生活。法庭听证会是记录 来自不同背景的人作为证人和被告的言论的场所之一。这些来源揭示了那些很少听到声音的人. 社会史领域已 经取得了长足的进步，它的目光超越了政治，触及了过去生活的日常生活方面。但由于缺乏记录，要 在与传统上掌权者平等的基础上代表妇女、穷人和少数群体仍然很困难。

In the case of Latin America, the historical record was significantly altered when the Europeans arrived. Believing that much of the writing of Indigenous people that they found spoke of a religion and culture they meant to replace, the conquerors deliberately destroyed it. Writing Africa’s history is complicated by both its size and its diversity, as well as its colonial past. Due to the extremes of climate, surviving written documents and even archaeological evidence are not easily found, and what exists of written history is often tainted by the bias of the colonial observers who wrote it.

就拉丁美洲而言，当欧洲人到来时，历史记录发生了重大改变。征服者相信他们发现的土著人民的大 部分著作都谈到了他们打算取代的宗教和文化，因此故意摧毁了它。书写非洲的历史因其幅员辽阔、 多样性以及殖民历史而变得复杂。由于气候极端，幸存的书面文献甚至考古证据都不容易找到，而现 存的书面历史往往受到书写历史的殖民观察者的偏见的玷污。

Once we know how to muster as many facts as we can, we must consider the next step—understanding causation. What are the forces that shape history, that shift it one way or another, that move people to change on both an individual and a societal level?

一旦我们知道如何收集尽可能多的事实，我们就必须考 虑下一步——理解因果关系. 塑 造历史、以某种方式改变历史、推动人们在个人和社会层面进行变革的力量是什么？

Historians, particularly those trained in recent times, work to eliminate as much bias as they can, but we cannot wholly disconnect ourselves from our environment and beliefs. Bias can even sometimes act as a positive force, allowing us to look at the past in new ways.

历史学家，特别 是近代接受过培训的历史学家，致力于尽可能消除偏见，但我们不能完全脱离我们的环境和信 仰。偏见有时甚至可以充当积极的力量，让我们以新的方式看待过去。

Not all causes are equally significant; we need to rank them in importance. Which causes had the most influence on you, and which were more remote? The primary cause is the most immediate. It is the spark. The secondary cause is once removed. The tertiary cause offers the broader context.

并非所有原因都同样重 要；我们需要对它们的重要性进行排名。哪些原因对您影响最大，哪些影响较小？主要原因是最直接的。这是火花。次要原因一旦消除。第三因提供了更广泛 的背景。

In 1453, Mehmed II laid siege to the city of Constantinople. Why? Mehmed II was the leader of the Ottoman Empire, the sultan. He had been badly treated by his father, and when he ascended the throne, he felt he had something to prove. The Ottomans had tried several times to take Constantinople because it lay at the crossroads of many civilizations. Conquest had long been a reliable mechanism for bringing new people and wealth into the Ottoman Empire and for keeping its economy prosperous. All these factors played a role in the siege undertaken by Mehmed II. Can you order them by importance? This is the point where historians usually disagree, even about events for which most of the facts are clear. A historian who believes powerful leaders are the most influential factor driving events would rank Mehmed’s personal goals first. Base your ranking on the strongest arguments you can make.

1453年，穆罕默德二世围攻君士坦丁堡城。为什么？穆罕默德二世是奥斯曼帝国 的领袖、苏丹。他曾受到父亲的虐待，当他登上王位时，他觉得自己有必要证明一些事情。奥斯曼帝 国曾多次试图占领君士坦丁堡，因为它位于许多文明的十字路口。长期以来，征服一直是为奥斯曼帝 国带来新人口和财富并保持其经济繁荣的可靠机制。所有这些因素都在穆罕默德二世的围攻中发挥了 作用。你能按重要性排序吗？这是历史学家通常意见不一致的一点，即使对于大多数事实已经明确的 事件也是如此。一位历史学家认为强大的领导人是推动事件发生的最有影响力的因素，他会将穆罕默 德的个人目标排在第一位。您的排名基于您能提出的最有力的论据。

There can be more than three causes to any event, of course, and because human choice always plays a role, we sometimes cannot separate events on the big stage from the smallest of personal moments in history. The context of the Ottoman Empire’s continuous expansion set the scene in this example, and Mehmed II’s desire to prove his ability was the spark.

当然，任何事件都可能有三个以上的原因，而且由于人类的选择总是发挥作用，我们有时无法将大舞 台上的事件与历史上最小的个人时刻分开。这个例子的背景是奥斯曼帝国不断扩张的背景，而穆罕默 德二世想要证明自己能力的愿望就是火花。(慈禧脑袋一拍, 就决定宣战八国联军)

One of the early European schools of thought was progressive history, which viewed history as a straight line to a specific destination. Historians with this “progressive” view believed societies were becoming more democratic over time. Their perspective might also be considered a form of teleological history, which proposes that history is moving to a particular end. Progressive historians believed in the betterment of people and of society, so long as it occurred on a European model. Progress looked only one way: the Western way.

欧洲早期的思想流派之一是进步历史学，它将历史视为通往特 定目的地的直线。持有这种“进步”观点的历史学家认为，随着时间的推移，社会变得更加民主. 他们的观点也可能被认为是目的论历史的一种形式，它提出历史正在走向一 个特定的终点. 进步历史学家相信人民和社会会变得更好，只要它是按照欧洲模 式发生的。进步看起来只有一种方式：西方方式。

In the twentieth century, particularly after World War I, the idea of inevitable human progress seemed laughable. People grew more willing to question the authority of elites. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the psychology behind people’s choices. This is one reason for the rise of contemporary intellectual history, which looks at the ideas that drive people to make certain choices and focuses on philosophical questions and the history of human thought.

在二十世纪，特别是第一次世界大战之后，人类不可避免地进步的想法似乎很可笑。人们越来越愿意 质疑精英的权威. 历史学家对人类状况的非理性 方面以及人们选择背后的心理变得更加感兴趣。这是当代思想史兴起的原因之一，它着眼于驱使人们 做出某些选择的思想，并关注哲学问题和人类思想史。

Our belief systems are informed by social constructs, ideas that have been created and accepted by the people in a society, such as the concepts of class distinction and gender. Social constructs influence the ways people think and behave.

我们的信仰体系是由社会建构、社会中人们创造和接受的观念（例如阶级概念）决定的。区 别和性别。社会结构影响人们的思维和行为方式。

Trends in Historical Thought. Historians’ thinking has led from the progressive school of interpretation to the more contemporary fields of intellectual and social history.

To understand history, you must understand the social construction of reality, which is the way people define roles and perceive themselves within a social context. Consider our earlier thought exercise. You believe education is important. Why? Who has said that to you in the past? How did you come to believe it? In other words, what is your social construction of education, and where did it come from?

要理解历史，你必须理解现实的社会建构，这是人们在社会背景下定义角色和感知自己的方式。考虑 一下我们之前的思维练习。您认为教育很重要。为什么？过去谁对你说过这样的话？你怎么会相信它 呢？换句话说，你的教育的社会建构是什么？它从何而来？

Social constructs exist everywhere and inform many decisions we make, often on a subconscious level. For example, consider the following questions:

社会结构无处不在，并影响我们做出的许多决定，通常是在潜意识层面上。例如，考虑以下问题：

1.What do you buy a five-year-old girl for her birthday? What do you buy for a boy the same age? What influenced your decision?

给五岁小女孩买什么生日礼物？给同龄男孩买什么？是什么影响了你的决定？

2.What would you wear to a job interview? What would you wear to a party? Why? 你会穿什么去参加工作面试？你会穿什么去参加聚会？为什么？

3.To which person standing at the front of a classroom would you give more respect: a woman dressed in a tailored suit, or a man wearing jeans and a t-shirt? Why?

你会更尊重站在教室前面的哪个人：穿着定制西装的女士，还是穿着牛仔裤和 T 恤的男士？为什 么？

In the process we call revisionism, each additional lens revised the great man story of history, adding new key players and viewpoints.

在我们 称之为修正主义的过程中，每一个额外的镜头都修正了历史上的伟人故事，增加了新的关键人物和观 点。

How would each school of historical thought approach the story of …​?

每个历史思想流派将如何看待…​的故事？所有这些解释元素帮助我们编织出一幅更完整的过去图景。

the practice of historical empathy, the ability to meet the past on its own terms and without judgment or the imposition of our own modern-day attitudes. Everyone has a set of biases, Historians must investigate these biases and understand how they affect their interpretations. It is not the historian’s job to pass judgment on the past, but to present it as clearly as possible and to preserve that clarity for future generations. This may mean reflecting impartially on historical positions, attitudes, or decisions we might find abhorrent as viewed from today’s world.

历史同理心的实践，即以过去的方式来 面对过去的能力，而不用评判或强加我们自己的现代态度。每个人都有一系列偏见，历史学家必须调查这些偏见并了解它们如何影响他们的解释。历史学家 的工作不是对过去做出判断，而是尽可能清晰地呈现过去，并为后代保留这种清晰度。这可能意味着 公正地反思从当今世界来看我们可能会觉得令人憎恶的历史立场、态度或决定。(即不能用现代人的价值观, 来强求古人.)

The bottom line is that interpretation plays a central role in the field of history. The danger lies in using only one lens. Yes, historians choose some causes as more important than others, but only after considering all the information available.

最重要的是，解释在历史领域发挥着核心作用。危险在于只使用一个镜头。是的，历史学家会选择某些原因比其他原因更重 要，但前提是考虑了所有可用信息。

== (pure)  Causation and Interpretation in History


What is history? it is a path to knowing why we are the way we are — all our greatness, all our faults — and therefore a means for us to understand ourselves and change for the better.


But history serves this function only if it is a true reflection of the past. It cannot be a way to mask the darker parts of human nature, nor a way to justify acts of previous generations. It is the historian’s task to paint as clear a picture as sources will allow.

Will history ever be a perfect telling of the human tale? No. There are voices we may never hear.


“Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” Yet because history is an everchanging collection of events influenced and shaped by a variety of causes and outcomes, it never truly repeats at all.


The study of history will also enhance your critical-thinking and analytical ability, both of which consistently appear among the top ten skills desired by employers (Figure 1.2). Other skills that have become increasingly important include adaptive thinking, social intelligence, cross-cultural competency, and media literacy. It also hones a creative mindset that is flexible and open to interpretations and ideas outside our own worldview.


Historians must also be effective communicators. Who cares about a story nobody reads or a product nobody buys?


This text and its assessment questions will encourage you to analyze large amounts of information, to understand a myriad of concepts, and to make connections across topics. Developing cultural awareness and empathy is also critically important. In our workplaces, in our world, we are a diverse people. Learning how to respect, communicate and collaborate with an increasingly diverse work culture is crucial to optimizing a company’s efficiency and productivity. Knowing about the world will prepare you to be a global citizen.


It found that in times of prosperity, sentiments favoring a world community grow, while in times of strife, people tend to revert to more local, national identities.


In many ways, the idea of global citizenship emerged from the human wreckage of the two world wars. Beginning in 1948, the United Nations (UN) established a series of universal declarations that conceived of all people as deserving of human rights and dignity (Figure 1.3). Three such declarations further affirmed the rights of women (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, also known as CEDAW, 1979), of children (The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959), and of people with disabilities (The Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, 1975). The UN regularly requires that member nations report on progress in these areas.


You will engage with firsthand accounts of key people and events — including instances in which people’s recollections of the same events might differ.


Maps are some of the most contested pieces of historical evidence we have because they were almost always made from the perspective of the one making the map, not as an objective practice.

During the Age of Exploration, the Pope arbitrarily divided inhabited territory that was new to Europeans and granted it to Spain and Portugal. Centuries later, European diplomats drew lines on a map of Africa to apportion territory among colonial powers.


There are two main kinds of historical sources, primary and secondary. A primary source is a gateway to the past because it is an object or document that comes directly from the time period to which it refers. Primary sources might be government documents, menus from restaurants, diaries, letters, and so on.

Primary sources, when we have them, are considered more valuable than other sources because they are as close in time as we can get to the events being studied. Think, for example, of a court trial: The ideal is to have the trial quickly so that witness testimony is fresher and therefore more reliable. With the passage of time, people can forget, they might subconsciously add or take away parts of a memory, and they may be influenced to interpret events differently. A secondary source is one written or created after the fact. Good research requires both types of sources and some attention to historiography, which is the study of how other historians have already interpreted and written about the past.


History technically begins with the advent of writing. For historians, the written word is more accurate evidence for building narratives of the past. For example, imagine a modern magazine with a rock or pop star on the front, dressed for performance in a vibrant or provocative style. If that were the only piece of evidence that existed five hundred years from now, how would historians interpret our era? Without context, interpretation of the past is quite difficult. Studying artifacts is certainly worthwhile, but text offers us greater clarity. Even if the cover of the magazine bore only a caption, like “Pop star rising to the top of the charts,” future historians would have significantly more information than from the photo alone.


Consider the act of reading a poem. You can read the surface of a poem, the literal meaning of the words presented. But that seldom reflects the true meaning the poet meant to convey. You must also look for nuances, hidden meanings, or repeated metaphors. We approach a primary source in a similar way.


There are four key areas to consider when interpreting sources: the author, the audience, the intent, and the context. Here are some key questions to ask yourself when exploring a new source:

1.What kind of source is it? Government documents have a different purpose than personal diaries. A former president commenting on a political issue has a different view from a comedian doing the same.


2.Who authored the source and why? Is the author responsible for simply recording the information, or was the author involved in the event? Is the author reliable, or does the author have an agenda?


3.What is the historical context? How does the source relate to the events covered in the chapter?


The internet has just as much misinformation as it has legitimate sources. Historians evaluate the strength of both primary and secondary sources, especially online. How do we decide what a good source is? It is unlikely any truly scholarly material will be found on the first page of a Google search, unless the search terms include key phrases or use targeted search engines such as Google Scholar. Online encyclopedias may be a good place to start your research, but they should be only a springboard to more refined study.


Sites like Wikipedia and Encyclopedia.com offer a quick view of content, but they will not give enough depth to allow for the critical thinking necessary to produce quality work. However, they are useful for introducing a topic with which you might not be familiar. They might spark new lines of inquiry, for instance, or have bibliographic information that can lead you to higher-quality material.


Always make sure you can tell who is producing the website. Is it a scholar, a museum, or a research organization? If so, there is a good chance the material is sound. Is the information cited? In other words, does the source tell you where it got the information? Are those sources in turn objective and reliable? Can you corroborate the site’s information? This means doing some fact checking. You should see whether other sources present similar data and whether your source fits into the narrative developed by other scholars. Does your school library list the site as a resource?

As you explore world history via this text, you will be asked many times to read and interpret primary sources.


Exterior of Hagia Sophia decorated with Greek iconography. Churches at the time were meant to inspire awe; because most people could not read, stories of religious figures and events were told through highly decorative and symbolic images, and obedience and a desire to join a religious community could be motivated by the buildings’ grandeur. As you study the renderings, reflect on the following questions: What are the key features of the building? What does it make you think about? What would you think about it if you were a poor sixth-century farmer, an urban merchant of some wealth, or a foreign leader?

Textual, or written, primary sources are considered the best possible resource for historians. They tend to offer both far more context and far more information than other types of sources, and sometimes clues about the writer’s intent. But even they must be approached with method and scrutiny. We must evaluate the author, audience, intent, and context in order to accurately interpret a primary source document. Some questions you might ask about the author include the following: Who wrote the piece and what is their background? What was important to the author? Why might the author have written what they did? A deeper inspection might reveal hidden motives.



You must also take into account the planned audience for a document: For whom was it written? Was it meant to be public or private? Is it a letter to a friend or an essay submitted for publication?


You should think about the intent: Why was the document written? Was it intended to be a factual account of an event? Was it meant to persuade? Is it a complete falsification? Often people write things that present them in the best light rather than reveal weaknesses.


Finally, you should reflect on the circumstances of the document’s creation. What is the general time period of the document, and what was that time like? What was happening when the individual wrote the document? Was there any sort of intimidation or distress? Is it a time of war or peace? Is there religious conflict? Is there an economic crisis? A health crisis? A natural disaster? Could the writer have been fending off an attack or lobbying for one? Are we missing other perspectives or voices we would like to hear?


The answers to these questions will shape your interpretation of the primary source and bring you closer to its true meaning. Most text-based sources have meanings beyond the obvious, and it is the historian’s job to uncover these. Be sure to keep these questions in mind throughout this course and whenever you undertake historical research or are considering the accuracy of information you encounter.


- To whom is each author writing?


- How do the authors’ different intentions affect what they wrote?

- One author was on the side of the victorious and one among the vanquished. How does this context affect the tone of the writing?


The different types of language used in a source are clues to its interpretation. Linguists call the use of language rhetoric. Rhetorical choices, decisions about the way words are used and put together, are often deliberate and intended to achieve a certain outcome.


President Franklin D. Roosevelt went to Congress and asked for a declaration of war against Japan. The speech he gave, however, was about more than this request. Roosevelt used certain words to highlight that the attack was secret and calculated. He also suggested that God was on the side of the United States. As you read, pay special attention to the words Roosevelt uses. Can you pick out a few key rhetorical choices?


One challenge is that written sources are undeniably valuable but often leave out important details. For example, many speak only of the lives of elites. It is not terribly difficult to find information about kings, queens, and other rulers of the past, but what of their families? Their servants? What of the ordinary people who lived under their rule?


Some groups of people remain hidden in our account of history because few records talk about their lives and experiences. Historians of the 1960s began to revolutionize the discipline by studying history “from the bottom up.” In other words, they began to focus on just those groups that had long been ignored. They used sources like church records, newspapers, and court hearings to illuminate the lives of the poor and illiterate. Court hearings were one venue in which the words of people from all backgrounds were recorded as they served as witnesses and as accused.

These kinds of sources shed light on those whose voices were rarely heard. Great strides have been made in the field of social history, which looks beyond politics to the everyday aspects of life in the past. But it remains difficult, lacking records, to represent women, the poor, and minority communities on an equal footing with those who have traditionally held power.



In the case of Latin America, the historical record was significantly altered when the Europeans arrived. Believing that much of the writing of Indigenous people that they found spoke of a religion and culture they meant to replace, the conquerors deliberately destroyed it. Writing Africa’s history is complicated by both its size and its diversity, as well as its colonial past. Due to the extremes of climate, surviving written documents and even archaeological evidence are not easily found, and what exists of written history is often tainted by the bias of the colonial observers who wrote it.


Once we know how to muster as many facts as we can, we must consider the next step—understanding causation. What are the forces that shape history, that shift it one way or another, that move people to change on both an individual and a societal level?


Historians, particularly those trained in recent times, work to eliminate as much bias as they can, but we cannot wholly disconnect ourselves from our environment and beliefs. Bias can even sometimes act as a positive force, allowing us to look at the past in new ways.


Not all causes are equally significant; we need to rank them in importance. Which causes had the most influence on you, and which were more remote? The primary cause is the most immediate. It is the spark. The secondary cause is once removed. The tertiary cause offers the broader context.



In 1453, Mehmed II laid siege to the city of Constantinople. Why? Mehmed II was the leader of the Ottoman Empire, the sultan. He had been badly treated by his father, and when he ascended the throne, he felt he had something to prove. The Ottomans had tried several times to take Constantinople because it lay at the crossroads of many civilizations. Conquest had long been a reliable mechanism for bringing new people and wealth into the Ottoman Empire and for keeping its economy prosperous. All these factors played a role in the siege undertaken by Mehmed II. Can you order them by importance? This is the point where historians usually disagree, even about events for which most of the facts are clear. A historian who believes powerful leaders are the most influential factor driving events would rank Mehmed’s personal goals first. Base your ranking on the strongest arguments you can make.



There can be more than three causes to any event, of course, and because human choice always plays a role, we sometimes cannot separate events on the big stage from the smallest of personal moments in history. The context of the Ottoman Empire’s continuous expansion set the scene in this example, and Mehmed II’s desire to prove his ability was the spark.


One of the early European schools of thought was progressive history, which viewed history as a straight line to a specific destination. Historians with this “progressive” view believed societies were becoming more democratic over time. Their perspective might also be considered a form of teleological history, which proposes that history is moving to a particular end. Progressive historians believed in the betterment of people and of society, so long as it occurred on a European model. Progress looked only one way: the Western way.



In the twentieth century, particularly after World War I, the idea of inevitable human progress seemed laughable. People grew more willing to question the authority of elites. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the psychology behind people’s choices. This is one reason for the rise of contemporary intellectual history, which looks at the ideas that drive people to make certain choices and focuses on philosophical questions and the history of human thought.

Our belief systems are informed by social constructs, ideas that have been created and accepted by the people in a society, such as the concepts of class distinction and gender. Social constructs influence the ways people think and behave.

Trends in Historical Thought. Historians’ thinking has led from the progressive school of interpretation to the more contemporary fields of intellectual and social history.


To understand history, you must understand the social construction of reality, which is the way people define roles and perceive themselves within a social context. Consider our earlier thought exercise. You believe education is important. Why? Who has said that to you in the past? How did you come to believe it? In other words, what is your social construction of education, and where did it come from?


Social constructs exist everywhere and inform many decisions we make, often on a subconscious level. For example, consider the following questions:


1.What do you buy a five-year-old girl for her birthday? What do you buy for a boy the same age? What influenced your decision?

2.What would you wear to a job interview? What would you wear to a party? Why?

3.To which person standing at the front of a classroom would you give more respect: a woman dressed in a tailored suit, or a man wearing jeans and a t-shirt? Why?



In the process we call revisionism, each additional lens revised the great man story of history, adding new key players and viewpoints.


How would each school of historical thought approach the story of …​?


the practice of historical empathy, the ability to meet the past on its own terms and without judgment or the imposition of our own modern-day attitudes. Everyone has a set of biases, Historians must investigate these biases and understand how they affect their interpretations. It is not the historian’s job to pass judgment on the past, but to present it as clearly as possible and to preserve that clarity for future generations. This may mean reflecting impartially on historical positions, attitudes, or decisions we might find abhorrent as viewed from today’s world.


The bottom line is that interpretation plays a central role in the field of history. The danger lies in using only one lens. Yes, historians choose some causes as more important than others, but only after considering all the information available.
