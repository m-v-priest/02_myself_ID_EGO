== 政治体制

=== feudalism 封建制度

In the ashes of the Carolingian world, medieval Europe embraced a social system called feudalism.

在(法兰克)加洛林王朝的废墟中，中世纪的欧洲拥抱了一种被称为"封建主义"的社会制度.

|"领主"的权利和义务
|Lords began to grant lands to fighters as their fiefs, whose produce the warriors could enjoy so long as they served the lord.

领主开始将土地授予战士作为 他们的封地，只要战士为领主服务，他们就可以享用他们的农产品。

However, the need to placate their feudal lords ensured that kings gave away lands and privileges, often weakening them. In other cases, crushing rebellious vassals was a way of taking back needed land.

然而，为了安抚封建领主，国王们不 得不放弃土地和特权，这往往会削弱他们的实力. 在其他情况下，镇压叛乱的封臣是夺回 所需土地的一种方式。(削藩)





|"封臣"的权利和义务
|For their part, fighters became vassals of the lord, sworn to perform service in exchange for the land. This service was chiefly military in nature, but it could also include other obligations like advising the lord and attending his court when called.

就战士而言，他们成为领主的附 庸，发誓为土地服务。这项服务本质上主要是军事性的，但也可能包括其他义务，例如向领主提供建 议以及在接到命令时出席他的宫廷。


|农奴
|On their fiefs, the warriors oversaw the work of agricultural laborers. Some laborers might own their own land and be self-directed, but most in western Europe were unfree, servile laborers called serfs who were tied to the land. They were not enslaved and could not be bought or sold, but they occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder.

在(封臣)他们的封地里，战士们监督农业劳动者的工作。一些劳动者可能拥有自己的土地并且可以自我指 导，但在西欧，大多数劳动者都是不自由的奴役劳动者，被称为农奴，他们被束缚在土地上。他们不 是奴隶，不能被买卖，但他们处于社会阶梯的最底层.

Serfs owed their lord `双宾` a set number of days of service a year (these were many) and could not leave the land, marry, or undertake other work without the lord’s permission.

农奴每年要为领主服务一定天数（这些天数 很多），未经领主许可不得离开土地、结婚或从事其他工作。

|===

Bishoprics and monasteries behaved the same way; abbots and abbesses could be lords who were owed service and also owed service to greater lords.

"主教教区"和"修道院"也是如此; 修道院院长和女修道院院长, 既可以是"领主"身份，也可以为更大的领主服务。


While feudalism was not a political system, warriors owed service to lords who owed service to the king, who in theory was the largest landowner in the kingdom and the guarantor of rights and privileges.

虽然"封建制度"不是一种政治制度，但战士们要为领主服务，而领主又要为国王服务，理论上，国王是 王国最大的地主，也是权利和特权的保障者。



'''



=== 经济

Although cities on the coast often maintained commercial or networking ties with each other, society in western Europe was overwhelmingly rural, and production was largely at the subsistence level.

People produced what they were going to consume, and surplus went to the lord or the church as a mandatory tax, usually 10 percent, called the tithe.

尽管沿海城市经常相互保持商业或网络联系，但西欧社会绝大多数是农村，生产主要处于自给自足的水平。人们生产他们要消费的东西，剩余的东西作为"强制税", 交给领主或教会，通常是 10%，称为"什一税"。


'''

=== 宗教

==== 教皇 Gregory 派 Augustine 去英国传教

Pope Gregory (also known as Gregory the Great) commissioned monks from Italy, led by Augustine of Canterbury, to convert the Anglo-Saxons. (Monks are men who do not marry, often live in community with each other, and devote their lives to serving God. Their female counterparts are called nuns.)

教皇格列 高利（也称为格列高利大帝）委托坎特伯雷的奥古斯丁领导的来自意大利的僧侣去改变盎格鲁撒克逊 人的信仰。 （僧侣是不结婚的男性，经常集体生活，一生致力于侍奉上帝。她们的女性同行被称为修 女。）

By the time of the Middle Ages, five ancient seats of Christianity were recognized as the most prestigious: Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople. Each was led by a bishop with the honorary title of “patriarch.”  +
In the tenth century, only Rome and Constantinople were in territory not controlled by Muslims.

到 了中世纪，五个古老的基督教圣地被认为是最有声望的：耶路撒冷、安条克城、亚历山大城、罗马城, 和君士坦丁堡。每个人都由一位享有“族长”荣誉称号的主教领导。 +
十世纪时，只有罗马和君士坦丁堡两城, 处于非穆斯林控制的地区。


'''

==== 教会从领主手中, 获得独立权

The chaotic aftermath of the collapse of the Carolingian Empire led to a complicated situation between secular rulers and the Christian Church. According to German law, lords had the right to control everything on their land, including churches and monasteries. This control even extended to the appointment of officeholders to church positions such as abbot or bishop. To ensure they had the loyalty of church officials, lords staffed these offices with their family members or even sold them to the highest bidder. The consequence was that those without religious vocations, or even familiarity with Christian doctrine, could be installed into church leadership. Even the position of the pope, the bishop of Rome, could come up for sale.

(法兰克)加洛林帝国崩溃后的混乱, 导致世俗统治者和基督教会之间的复杂局面。根据德国法律，领主有权控制 其土地上的一切，包括教堂和修道院。这种控制甚至延伸到任命官员担任教会职务，例如方丈或主 教。为了确保教会官员的忠诚，领主们在这些办公室里配备了他们的家人，甚至将它们卖给出价最高 的人。结果是，那些没有宗教职业，甚至不熟悉基督教教义的人，可以被任命为教会领导层。甚至罗 马教皇、罗马主教的职位也可能被出售。(买官卖官)

Revulsion at this treatment of religious office led to a reform movement intended to remove the influence of secular lords from the management of the church. The movement is often associated with the monastery of Cluny in France, which managed to get independence from the local aristocrat.
The Cluniac movement eventually drew in other clergy who wanted the church to control the election of bishops, independent of secular influence.

对宗教职务这种待遇的反感引发了一场改革运动，旨在消除世俗领主对教会管理的影响。该运动通常 与法国克鲁尼修道院联系在一起，该修道院成功地从当地贵族手中获得了独立。克吕尼 运动最终吸引了其他神职人员，他们希望教会能够独立于世俗影响来控制主教的选举。

罗马主教最终受到克吕尼运动的影响，改革教会。

The bishops of Rome were eventually influenced by the Cluniac movement to reform the church.

|-> 解决"买卖官职"的问题
|They condemned the sale of offices as a sin called simony and insisted that bishops should be elected by clergy, independent of a lord. Any clergy member who had bought an office or had it bought for them could be removed.

他们谴责出售官职是一种被称为买卖圣职的罪孽， 并坚持认为主教应该由神职人员选举产生，独立于领主。任何购买办公室或为他们购买办公室的神职 人员都可以被解雇。

|-> 解决教会体制内"父传子"的问题
|To end the practice of treating church positions like a fief to be passed on to the officeholder’s children, priests were told to practice celibacy and were forbidden to marry.

为了结束将教会职位视为封地传给官员子女的做法，牧师被告知要独身，并禁止 结婚。

|-> 如何区分"战争合法性"问题
|The reformers were also interested in creating a thoroughly Christianized society by distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate warfare. The church argued that Christian soldiers, especially knights, should obey a code of conduct that reflected the church’s values. For example,

- they should not loot monasteries or hold clergy for ransom.
- They should protect the church as well as women and the defenseless.
- They should observe periods of publicly declared truces and not fight on religiously significant days like Easter.

These principles contributed to the ideals of chivalry.

改革者还希望通过区分合法战争和非法战争, 来创建一个彻底基督教化的社会。教会认为基督教士兵， 尤其是骑士，应该遵守反映教会价值观的行为准则。例如，

- 他们不应该抢劫修道院或扣留神职人员勒 索赎金。
- 他们应该保护教会以及妇女和手无寸铁的人。
- 他们应该遵守公开宣布的休战期，不要在复活 节等具有宗教意义的日子里打架。

这些原则促成了骑士精神的理想.
|===

The church declared that a king who tried to appoint a bishop or asked for a bribe could be excommunicated (placed outside the church, its communion, and the sacraments, in hopes of reforming the offender). Excommunication could threaten the king’s position and lead to rebellions.

教会宣布，试图任命主教, 或要求贿赂的国王, 可以被逐出教会(被排除在教会、圣餐, 和圣礼之外，希望能改造罪犯)。 被逐出教会, 可能会威胁到国王的地位, 并引发叛乱。

The reform movement gained the church some moral prestige, but the growing power of the pope also worsened the relationship between the eastern and western halves of the faith.

改革运动为教会赢得了一定的道德威望，但教皇权力的不断增长, 也恶化了东西方(即西欧和东罗马帝国)信仰之间的关系。

In 1054, the pope sent representatives to the patriarch of Constantinople to discuss the differences between the two halves of the church. The pope’s chief representative felt the patriarch was not cooperating with or even recognizing the embassy, so he issued a letter excommunicating the patriarch and his followers. Soon after, the patriarch issued his own letter excommunicating the pope’s representatives. Following this Great Schism of 1054, the eastern church became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the western half the Catholic Church.

1054年，教皇派代表到君士坦丁堡的宗主教那里，讨论教会两部分之间的差异。教皇的首席代表认为，这位宗主教不与大使馆合作，甚至不承认大使馆，因此他发出了一封信函，将这位宗主教及其追随者逐出教会。不久之后，这位宗主教发表了自己的信，将教皇的代表逐出教会。在1054年的大分裂之后，东方教会被称为东正教，而西半部则被称为天主教。

== 中世纪发展与灭亡框架

=== 西欧部分

Western Afro-Eurasia faced a number of challenges in the early Middle Ages, the period from about 500 to 1000 CE. With the collapse of Roman authority came a time of political instability and insecurity. Cities declined, and institutions of learning weakened. Western Europe became increasingly rural. Because there was no longer a strong centralized state to develop and police the roads, travel became more difficult and more dangerous, harming commerce.

西非-欧亚大陆在中世纪早期（大约公元 500 年至 1000 年）面临着许多挑战。随着罗马权威的崩溃， 政治不稳定和不安全的时期到来了。城市衰落，学习机构衰弱。西欧变得越来越乡村化。由于不再有 一个强大的中央集权国家来开发和监管道路，旅行变得更加困难和危险，损害了商业。

==== the Franks 法兰克王国

|-> 墨洛温王朝
|The most successful Germanic kingdom was that of the Franks. Clovis I, a member of the Merovingian dynasty, founded the kingdom in the early sixth century.

最成功的日耳曼王国是法兰克王国。墨洛温王朝成员克洛维一世(法兰克王国奠基人)于六世纪初建立了该王国.

A chief source of conflict was the practice of partible inheritance, whereby each son received an equal share of his father’s estate. Estates thus became smaller with each successive generation unless new lands were conquered, often by being taken from siblings, in-laws, or cousins. Kings without land and resources to offer as reward lost the ability to attract fighters.

Real power lay with the aristocrats, and eventually a new dynasty called the Carolingians took control of the Frankish kingdom.

随着时间的推移，墨洛温王朝的统治者陷入了暴力的内讧. 冲突的一个主要根源是分割继承的做法，即每个儿子均分其父亲的遗产。因此，每一代人 的庄园都会变得越来越小，除非征服了新的土地，通常是从兄弟姐妹、姻亲或表兄弟那里夺取的。没 有土地和资源作为奖励的国王就失去了吸引战士的能力。

真正的权力掌握在贵族手中，最终一个名为 加洛林王朝的新王朝, 控制了法兰克王国。

|-> 加洛林王朝
|With the support of the pope, Pépin le Bref (Pippin the Short) became the first Carolingian king of the Franks, deposing his Merovingian rival. In return, he confirmed a grant of lands in Italy to the pope. This grant, known as the Donation of Pepin, provided the legal basis for the establishment of the Papal States and helped ensure that the papacy, the set of administrative structures associated with the government of the Catholic Church, was not just a religious institution but also a territorial power.

Their alliance with the popes allowed the Carolingian rulers to work independently of the Byzantine Empire.

在教皇的支持下，皮平(矮子"丕平")成为第一位"加洛林王朝"的法兰克国王，废黜了他的"墨洛温王朝"对手。作为回报，他确认将意大利的土地, 授予教皇。这项被称为"佩平捐赠"的拨款，为"教皇国"的建立提供了法律基础，并有助于确保教皇这一与"天主教会"政府相关的行政机构，不仅是一个宗教机构，而且海拥有领土权力。

他们与教皇的联盟, 使得"加洛林王朝"的统治者, 能够独立于"拜占庭帝国"运作。

|-> 查理曼帝国
|
Pépin’s son Charles, known as Charlemagne (“Charles the Great”), was the most influential ruler in the early European Middle Ages. He campaigned nearly every year of his reign, uniting western Europe for the first time since the collapse of Roman authority.

On Christmas Day in the year 800, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III. This coronation angered Byzantine rulers and set the stage for conflict between east and west in their quest for prestige and territory.

丕平的儿子查理，被称为查理曼大帝（“查理大帝”），是欧洲中世纪早期最有影响力的统治者. 他在位期间, 几乎每年都征战，自罗马权威崩溃以来, 首次统一了西欧。

800年圣诞节，查理曼大帝被教皇利奥三世, 加冕为罗马皇帝。这次加冕礼激怒了"拜占庭"统治者，并为东西方之间争夺威望和领土的冲突, 埋下了伏笔。

Charlemagne’s empire did not last. These internal problems were worsened by external ones, especially new invaders emboldened by the collapse of Carolingian strength. From the east came nomadic raiders, the Magyars, a non- Germanic people who migrated from the steppes of central Asia. At the end of the ninth century, they settled in what is today Hungary, and from there they launched devastating raids for plunder into Germany.

查理曼的帝国并没有持续多久。 这些内部问题, 因外部问题而变得更加严重，尤其是由于"加洛林王朝"实力崩溃而引来了胆大妄为的新入侵者。 来自东方的游牧掠夺者马扎尔人, 是从中亚草原迁徙而来的非日耳曼民族。九世纪末，他们定居在今天的匈牙利，并从那里对德国发起毁灭性的掠夺。

'''

==== the Vikings 维京人


Perhaps more famous today than the Magyars and Islamic raiders were the Norse who raided northern Europe from Scandinavia, called the Vikings. The peoples of Scandinavia, who spoke Germanic languages, had a culture similar to that of the Germanic peoples who settled in the Roman Empire.

今天，也许比"马扎尔人"和"伊斯兰袭击者"更出名的, 是从"斯堪的纳维亚半岛"袭击北欧的挪威人，即"维京人"。斯堪的纳维亚半岛的人民, 讲日耳曼语言，其文化与定居在罗马帝国的日耳曼人民相似。


The growth of the population in the eighth century and the relative lack of arable land in Scandinavia compelled groups of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes to travel in search of plunder.

Some made trading connections along the Dnieper River, establishing settlements at Kiev that eventually became one of the first Russian states. They reached Constantinople, and some served as the personal bodyguard to the Byzantine ruler. These Vikings were known as Varangians, and they settled in eastern Europe.

Although violent, they were also traders, interested in paving the way for new settlements and connections beyond western Europe.

八世纪人口的增长, 和"斯堪的纳维亚半岛"耕地的相对缺乏, 迫使丹麦人、挪威人和瑞典人, 向外部世界寻找掠夺品。(他们中)有些人沿着第聂伯河建立贸易联系，在基辅建立定居点，最终成 为俄罗斯最早的国家之一。他们到达君士坦丁堡，其中一些人担任拜占庭统治者的私人保镖。这些维 京人被称为瓦兰吉人，他们定居在东欧。

尽管他们很暴力，但他们也是商人，有兴趣为新的定居点, 和西欧以外的联系, 铺平道路。

In the west, the arrival of the Norse raiders was less benign. The sudden nature of the violent raids, and the inability of Frankish or Anglo-Saxon armies to defeat them, instilled fear in the population of western Europe.

但在西方，挪威入侵者的到来就不那么友好了。他们暴力袭击的突然性，以及法兰克或盎格鲁撒克逊军队无力击败他们，给西欧人民带来了恐惧。


Eventually, the Norse raiders began to settle in regions rather than just raid them.

- In 865, a substantial army of Vikings invaded Britain and destroyed most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except for Wessex.
- In 911, they settled in northern France, establishing the duchy of Normandy.
- By the end of the tenth century, Vikings had also established settlements throughout the British Isles, including Ireland and Scotland, farther west in Iceland and Greenland, and even (though briefly) in North America.

Not just raiders, they promoted trade throughout northern Europe and beyond, extending their trading routes to the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate.

Like the earlier Germanic peoples, they eventually converted to Roman Christianity, and their kings began to build more centralized kingdoms that enabled them to curb the violence of the raiders.

最终，挪威掠夺者开始在一些地区定居，而不仅仅是袭击它们。 865年，维京人大军入侵不列颠，摧毁 了除威塞克斯以外的大部分盎格鲁撒克逊王国。 911年，他们在法国北部定居，建立诺曼底公国。到十 世纪末，维京人还在不列颠群岛各地建立了定居点，包括爱尔兰和苏格兰，更西边的冰岛和格陵兰岛，甚至（尽管短暂）北美。

他们不仅是掠夺者，还促进整个北欧及其他地区的贸易，将贸易路线延 伸至拜占庭帝国和阿巴斯哈里发国。

像早期的日耳曼民族一样，他们最终皈依了罗马基督教，他们的 国王开始建立更加中央集权的王国，使他们能够遏制入侵者的暴力。

By the tenth century, the old Roman Empire was largely forgotten by the general population.

====  夺取耶路撒冷, 建立十字军国家 (第1次十字军东征)

In 1095, facing invasion on all sides, the Byzantine ruler Alexios I sent ambassadors to plead for help from the pope and an opportunity for a reconciliation between the two churches. Urban answered the Byzantine emperor’s call for aid.

1095年，面对四面楚歌的入侵，拜占庭统治者阿莱克修斯一世派遣大使向罗马教皇请求帮助，并为两个教会提供了和解的机会。(东西两个教会已经在1054年时大分裂了). (罗马教皇)乌尔班回应了拜占庭皇帝的援助呼吁.

Pope Urban II was a supporter of church reform, and that put him at odds with German emperors like Henry IV, who insisted on his own right to appoint bishops, even the bishop of Rome.

教皇乌尔班二世是"教会改革"的支持者(即他支持教会独立与王权)，这使他与亨利四世等德国国王产生了分歧，(国王)亨利四世坚持自己能任命主教的权利，甚至是任命罗马主教。

Urban II presented his idea of religious war in response to the Byzantine request for aid at a council in Clermont, France, in 1095. While the council was ostensibly about reform, Urban also issued a call for Christians from all walks of life to undertake an “armed pilgrimage” to liberate the Christian Holy Land (the lands of the eastern Mediterranean associated with the life of Jesus and the biblical prophets, including Jerusalem) from “Turkic” control. Urban’s goal at this point was to free the Holy Land from non-Christian rulers in defense of the Christians living there; it was not a blanket endorsement of violence against Muslims. These limitations were later eased, however, as the popes discovered the power of calling repeated crusades to promote the reforming goals of the church and to compete with political rivals in Europe, like the German emperors.

1095 年，乌尔班二世在法国克莱蒙的一次会议上提出了他的宗教战争想法，以回应拜占庭的援助请 求。虽然该会议表面上是在讨论改革，但乌尔班二世也呼吁各行各业的基督徒开展一项改革。 “武装朝 圣”，旨在将基督教圣地（与耶稣和圣经先知的生活有关的东地中海土地，包括耶路撒冷）从“突厥”控 制下解放出来。乌尔班此时的目标是将圣地从非基督教统治者手中解放出来，以保卫居住在那里的基 督徒。这并不是全面支持针对穆斯林的暴力行为。然而，这些限制后来得到了缓解，因为教皇发现了号召反复十字军东征具有这种力量: 能促进教会改革, 并与德国皇帝等欧洲政治对手竞争.

The popes had no armies, and they often had to depend on the unreliable aristocracy for protection when disagreements over church policy resulted in armed conflict with the princes of Europe. If they were to maintain their control over the church in contests with kings and emperors, it would be useful to see what happened when a pope rallied common Christians to a religious cause as a test of faith.

教皇没有军队，当教会政策上的分歧导致与欧洲诸侯的武装冲突时，他们往往不得不依靠不可靠的贵族来保护。如果他们想在与国王和皇帝的竞争中, 保持自己对教会的控制，那么看看当教皇将普通基督徒召集到宗教事业上以考验信仰时会发生什么，将会很有用。

We do not have an exact copy of Urban’s speech in Clermont that launched the First Crusade, but others grafted their own ideas onto what they had heard, what others said they had heard, or what some people thought Urban should have said.

我们没有乌尔班在克莱蒙发动第一次十字军东征的演讲的精确副本，但其他人将自己的想法 移植到他们所听到的、其他人说他们听到的或一些人认为乌尔班应该说的话上。

|参加十字军的人的目的:
|- Some may have hoped to gain land if they remained in the Holy Land,
- and others were motivated simply to see the earthly Jerusalem as a way of experiencing the heavenly Jerusalem that awaited them when they died, and then returned home.

人们参加十字军的目的:

- 有些人可能希望如果留在圣地，就 能获得土地，
- 而另一些人的动机只是为了将地上的耶路撒冷视为一种体验天上耶路撒冷的方式，天上 的耶路撒冷在他们死后等待着他们，然后返回家园。

Many crusaders' expectation was that they would return home, and many pilgrims and crusaders did so rather than settling in the Holy Land.

(在建立了十字军国家之后,) 许多十字军战士的期望往往是返回家园，而许多朝圣者和十字军战士都这样做了, 而不是在圣地定居。

|十字军本身的目标:
|The earlier notion of crusade expanded to include Muslim kingdoms in Spain or elsewhere, non-Christian settlements in Europe, and even the domains of the pope’s political enemies in Europe.

早期十字军东征的概念扩大到包括西班牙或其他地方的穆斯林王国、欧洲的非基 督教定居点，甚至欧洲教皇政敌的领地。

The crusading ideal was also transformed by practice and experience. The popes now called holy wars not just to liberate Jerusalem but to fight against the enemies of the church. Crusades were called against non-Christians in the Baltic regions, against heretics in France, and even against the pope’s personal enemies in Italy.

(在以后的所有n次十字军行动失败后, 最后,) 十字军理想也因实践和经验而改变。教皇现在称圣战不仅是为了解放耶路撒冷，也是为了对抗教会的敌人。十字军东征的目标是波罗的海地区的非基督徒，法国的异端，甚至意大利的教皇的私人敌人 。

Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the crusading ideal declined in popularity. This was due in part to the decline of the power of the papacy and in part to the revival of royal power in the fourteenth century. The Crusades had been launched by popular popes. Over time, they came to seem more concerned about their own power and prestige and less like the hard-working clerics who had battled kings for the freedom of the church.

中世纪末期，十字军理想不再受欢迎。这部分是由于教皇权力的衰落，部分是由于十四世纪王权的复 兴。十字军东征是由教皇发动的。随着时间的推移，他们似乎越 来越关心自己的权力和威望，不再像那些为教会自由而与国王作战的辛勤工作的神职人员。

|第一次十字军行动, 隐士"彼得"一方的结果:

The Crusades were rarely well organized, however. During the First Crusade, the followers of Peter the Hermit arrived in Constantinople first. They did not wait for other groups to arrive and were ferried over to Anatolia (the Asian part of today’s Turkey) by Alexios, the Byzantine ruler. The Turks destroyed this army, and very few survived to return to Constantinople.

Later crusaders understood that gathering intelligence in Constantinople was crucial to avoiding Peter’s fate.


然而，十字军东征很少组织得很好. 第一次十字军东征期间，隐士彼得的追随者首先到达君士坦丁堡。他们没有等 待其他团体到达，就被拜占庭统治者阿莱克修斯运送到安纳托利亚（今天土耳其的亚洲部分）。土耳 其人摧毁了这支军队，很少有人幸存返回君士坦丁堡。 +
后来的十字军明白，在君士坦丁堡收集情报对 于避免彼得的命运至关重要。

|第一次十字军行动, 贵族军队一方的结果:
|The bulk of the First Crusade was directed by powerful aristocrats whose armies were better organized than Peter’s, even if most of its participants were not the most senior nobles of Western society. Alexios promised them aid in exchange for the return of Byzantine territory held by Muslims, which most initially agreed to.  ... straining the relationships between the crusaders and the Byzantine Empire.

第一次十字军东征的大部分由强大的贵族指挥，他们的军队比彼得的军队组织得更好，尽管大多数参与者并不是西方社会最高级的贵族。阿莱克修斯(拜占庭第二任皇帝)向他们承诺提供援助，条件是换取他们归还被穆斯林占领的拜占庭领土，大多数人最初都同意了。(但他们事后又没兑现承诺,) 这使得十字军与拜占庭帝国之间的关系变得紧张。

The crusading armies then took other important cities in the area, and to secure their control they established the four Crusader States: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. These Crusader States were also called Outremer (literally “overseas”) by the French.

(1099年占领耶路撒冷后,) 随后十字军占领了该地区的其他重要城市，为了确保控制 权，他们建立了四个十字军国家：埃德萨郡、安条克公国、的黎波里郡和耶路撒冷王国。这些十字军 国家也被法国人称为Outremer （字面意思是“海外”）.

The crusaders organized their government in feudal terms, but the native populations never became serfs owing service to their lords. Instead, they paid their taxes in cash or in goods.

十字军以"封建"形式组织了政府，但当地居民从未因为领主服务而成为农奴。相反，他们以现金或货物缴纳税款。



The lack of settlers from Europe ensured that the number of soldiers in Outremer was small. This was why the crusaders built imposing fortresses and castles, like the famous Krak des Chevaliers in Syria.

由于缺乏来自欧洲的定居者，海外地区的士兵数量很少。这就是为什么十字军建造了气势磅礴的堡垒和城堡，比如叙利亚著名的骑士堡.


早期十字军东征的路线。第一次至第四次十字军东征都面临着后勤和其他方面的挑战，并取得了不同程度的成功。

==== 萨拉丁夺取耶路撒冷 (第2次十字军东征时)

The Muslims adapted quickly, however. A Turkic aristocrat named Imad al-Din Zengi managed to take the city of Edessa, in the northernmost of the Crusader States. The loss of Edessa posed a serious threat to the remaining Crusader States, however, and prompted the pope to call the Second Crusade.

然而，穆斯林很快就适应了，一位名 叫伊马德·丁·曾吉（Imad al-Din Zengi）的突厥贵族成功占领了位于十字军国家最北 端的埃德萨市。埃德萨的 丧失对剩余的十字军国家构成了严重威胁，并促使教皇召开了第二次十字军东征。


The Second Crusade, from 1147 to 1149, was heralded by a new generation of preachers like Bernard of Clairvaux. Bernard also wrote the rules for the Knights Templar, one of the new crusading orders, religious orders of monks devoted to protecting Christian pilgrims and fighting to support Outremer.

This crusade was led by powerful rulers, including King Louis VII of France and King Conrad III of Germany. The armies of the Second Crusade were defeated in Anatolia in separate battles, and few soldiers reached the Holy Land. The kings accomplished very little, and many blamed the Byzantine emperor, who had learned to be distrustful of European armies.

1147 年至 1149 年的第二次十字军东征是由克莱尔沃的伯纳德 (Bernard of Clairvaux)等新一代传教士 发起的。伯纳德还为圣殿骑士团制定了规则，圣殿骑士团是新的十字军骑士 团之一，是致力于保护基督教朝圣者并为支持海外领土而战的僧侣宗教团体。

( In the early fourteenth century, the king of France accused the Knights Templar, one of the more popular crusading orders, of committing crimes such as blasphemy and apostasy (the rejection of Christianity). The order’s leaders were executed as heretics, and the popes disbanded the order, largely to please the French king.

("圣殿骑士团"以后的最终结局:) 十四世纪 初，法国国王指控圣殿骑士团（较受欢迎的十字军骑士团之一）犯有亵渎和叛教（拒绝基督教）等罪 行。该骑士团的领导人被作为异端分子处决，教皇解散了该骑士团，主要是为了取悦法国国王。)

这次十字军东征是由强 大的统治者领导的，其中包括法国国王路易七世和德国国王康拉德三世。第二次十字军东 征的军队在安纳托利亚的多次战斗中被击败，很少有士兵到达圣地。国王们几乎没有取得什么成就， 许多人指责拜占庭皇帝，因为他已经学会了对欧洲军队的不信任。

After this loss, the situation for Outremer only became more dire. Imad al-Din Zengi’s successors were well liked, even by crusaders, and they strove to unite the Muslim princes in jihad. The most famous of these successors was Salah al-Din, or Saladin in the Christian world. He was known for being humane, fair-minded, and, in Christians terms, chivalrous. In 1187, after years of gathering allies and eroding the military power of Outremer, he destroyed the crusaders at the Battle of the Horns of Hattin (in today’s Israel). Within months, Jerusalem fell to Saladin.

这次失利之后，Outremer的处境变得更加严峻。(伊斯兰的)伊马德·丁·赞吉的继任者很受欢迎，甚至受到十字军的 喜爱，他们努力团结穆斯林王子进行圣战。这些继任者中最著名的是萨拉丁（Salah al-Din），即基督 教世界的萨拉丁。他以仁慈、公正、用基督徒的话来说，具有侠义精神而闻名. 1187 年，经过多年聚集盟友并削弱海外的军事力量，他在哈丁角战役（位 于今天的以色列）消灭了十字军。几个月之内，耶路撒冷落入萨拉丁之手。

The Christians’ response was the Third Crusade (1189–1192).

基督徒的回应是第三次十字军东征（1189-1192）。

'''

==== 十字军东征 (第3次)


This crusade was prompted both by the fear that Outremer was about to be wiped off the map and by the desire to retake Jerusalem. Kings from England, the Holy Roman Empire, and France as well as other powerful princes answered the call. When they arrived in the last remaining Christian outposts in the Middle East, they quickly fell to squabbling with each other and the aristocracy of Outremer. As a result, the Christians were able to conquer the island of Cyprus and the coastline of the Holy Land but were unable to move farther inland.

这次十字军东征的动机既有对海外领土即将从地图 上消失的恐惧，也有夺回耶路撒冷的愿望。来自英格兰、神圣罗马帝国和法国的国王以及其他强大的 王子响应了这一号召。当他们到达中东仅存的基督教前哨基地时，他们很快就陷入了彼此之间以及海 外贵族的争吵之中。结果，基督徒能够征服塞浦路斯岛和圣地的海岸线，但无法进一步向内陆移动。

Eventually, Richard I of England, known in popular stories as Richard the Lionhearted, negotiated a treaty with Saladin that left Jerusalem under Muslim control but allowed Christian pilgrims to freely visit the city. Both Saladin and Richard were praised as examples of chivalric virtue in Europe and heroes of their respective religions. But this was one of the last successes the crusaders were to have in the Holy Land.


最终，英国的理查一世（在流行故事中被称为狮心王理查）与萨拉丁谈判达成一项条约，将耶路撒冷 置于穆斯林控制之下，但允许基督教朝圣者自由访问这座城市。萨拉丁和理查都被誉为欧洲骑士美德 的典范和各自宗教的英雄。但这是十字军在圣地取得的最后胜利之一。


The crusading movement continued after the Third Crusade, but enthusiasm waned.

第三次十字军东征后，十字军运动仍在继续，但热情减退。

'''

==== 十字军干涉东罗马帝国政治, 东西方关系再次恶化

Pope Innocent III, one of the most powerful medieval popes, called for a new crusade in 1202. The crusaders wanted to avoid the overland routes through Anatolia that had been a problem from the start. They hoped to avoid the Byzantine Empire too, because tensions between crusader leaders and the Byzantine emperors had been worsened by religious conflict and accusations of betrayal.

中世纪最有权势的教皇之一教皇英诺森三 世于 1202 年呼吁发动新的十字军东征。十字军希望避开穿越安纳托利亚的陆路路线，这从一开始就是 一个问题。他们也希望避开拜占庭帝国，因为宗教冲突和背叛指控加剧了十字军领袖和拜占庭皇帝之 间的紧张关系。

The crusaders continued to Constantinople, where they became involved in the internal politics of the Byzantine Empire and attacked the city, sacking it. While the Catholics established the short-lived Latin Empire of Constantinople, considerable damage had been done to the crusading movement and to relations between the Greek Orthodox and Catholic churches.

十字军继续前往君士坦丁堡，在那里他们参与了拜占庭帝国的内部政治，并袭击了这座城市，将其洗劫一空，试图让亲十字军的皇帝登上王位。虽然天主教徒建立了 短命的君士坦丁堡拉丁帝国，但十字军运动以及希腊东正教和天主教会之间的关系受到了相当大的损 害。

'''

==== 法国主导十字军

Later calls for crusades were met with some enthusiasm, but the object of the fight became Egypt, recognized as an important base for controlling the Holy Land. Nevertheless, later crusades became increasingly French and less successful at accomplishing their goals. The French crusader-king Louis IX led the Seventh and Eighth Crusades against Muslim rulers in North Africa and died of illness there. (He was later canonized as St. Louis.)

后来十字军东征的呼声得到了一些热情，但战斗的对象却变成了埃及，被认为是控制圣地的重要基 地。然而，后来的十字军东征越来越法国化，并且在实现其目标方面不太成功。法国十字军国王路易九世领导了第七次和第八次十字军东征，对抗北非的穆 斯林统治者，并在那里病逝。 （他后来被封为圣路易斯。）

When the port city of Acre in present-day Israel fell in 1291, the last of the Crusader States fell with it.

1291 年，当今天以色列的港口城市阿卡陷 落时，最后一个十字军国家也随之陷落。

=== 东罗马帝国(拜占庭帝国)


Constantine had effectively ushered in a new era of Christian governance. Rulers for the rest of the empire’s history were explicitly Christian, acting as de facto heads of the church and controlling church policy.

君士坦丁实 际上开创了基督教统治的新时代。帝国其他历史时期的统治者都是明确的基督教徒，他们充当事实上 的教会领袖并控制教会政策。

But while the emperors self-styled themselves as priestly rulers, the bishops sometimes contested this role, and emperors then had to compete with them for religious authority.

但是，虽然皇帝自称为祭司统治者，但主教有时会质疑这一角 色，皇帝就不得不与他们争夺宗教权威。


Historians have carved out roughly 150 to 750 CE as the period of Late Antiquity and view it as a time of vibrant transformation in the Mediterranean, rather than simply Rome’s decline and fall. People from this period thought of themselves as being different from what was seen in the ancient world.

历史学家将大约公元 150 年至 750 年划定为古代晚期时期，并将其视为地中海充满活力的变革时期， 而不仅仅是罗马的衰落和衰落。这一时期的人们在某些方面认为自己与古代世界不同。


The period of Late Antiquity witnessed the height of two great competing empires. The Roman Empire morphed into the Byzantine Empire. Meanwhile, in the East, the Sasanian Empire emerged and vied with the Byzantines for supremacy.

古代晚期见证了两个伟大的相互竞争的帝国的鼎盛时期。罗马帝国演变成拜占庭帝国. 在东方，萨珊王朝崛起，并与拜占庭帝国争夺霸权。


…, leading this period to be known as the “Byzantine Dark Age” because of the severe lack of historical writing that survived in the seventh and eight centuries.



由于七、八世纪的历史著 作严重缺乏, 导致这一时期被称为“拜占庭黑暗时代”.
