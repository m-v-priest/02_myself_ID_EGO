The fourteenth century was generally an era of chronic conflict and
instability for most of the continent.

对于欧洲大陆的大部分地区
来说，14世纪总体上是一个长期冲突和不稳定的时代


The Fourteenth Century Begins. This map depicts the patchwork of kingdoms and political entities in Europe and beyond
at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The many divisions ensured that political fragmentation rather than centralization defined
the region throughout the medieval period, and many states depicted here still lacked a strong, centralized rule entirely.

十四世纪开始。这张地图描绘了十四世纪初欧洲及其他地区的王国和政治实体的拼凑而成。在整个中世纪时期，许多分裂确保了
该地区的政治分裂而不是集权，并且这里描绘的许多国家仍然完全缺乏强大的集权统治。

In contrast to the stability that had defined much of the thirteenth century for the European Christian
Church, it began experiencing significant destabilization in the beginning of the fourteenth century,
when tensions between the pope and national monarchs led to a weakening of papal authority and
division within the church.

与欧洲基督教会在 13 世纪的大部分时间里保持稳定相反，它在 14 世纪初开始经历严重的不稳定，当
时教皇和国家君主之间的紧张关系导致教皇权威的削弱和教会内部的分裂。


The Hundred Years’ War
(1337–1453) erupted between England and France over claims to French lands held by the English
monarch.

英国和法国之间爆发了百年战争（1337-1453），争夺英国君主所拥有的法国土地。


Another center of political instability during this period was the Holy Roman Empire. In the
fourteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire, which had been founded by Charlemagne in 800,
comprised four main entities—the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Germany (including lands that
now are part of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), the Kingdom of
Burgundy (a region in southeastern France), and the Kingdom of Bohemia (what is now the Czech
Republic and part of Poland) under the nominal control of an elected emperor. Each of these
kingdoms, in turn, was composed of a loose coalition of independent territories with different
hereditary rulers. The emperor was chosen by a handful of these rulers known as electors.

这一时期另一个政治不稳定的中心是神圣罗马帝国。十四世纪，神圣罗马帝国由查理曼于 800 年建
立，由四个主要实体组成：意大利王国、德意志王国（包括现在属于比利时、荷兰、德国、奥地利、
和瑞士）、勃艮第王国（法国东南部的一个地区）和波西米亚王国（现在的捷克共和国和波兰的一部
分）在当选皇帝的名义控制下。这些王国又都是由具有不同世袭统治者的独立领土的松散联盟组成。
皇帝是由少数被称为选举人的统治者选出的。



Rather than adopting a common currency, legal system, or representative assembly, the Holy
Roman Empire remained a patchwork of semiautonomous principalities. Although each of these
became relatively stable, the empire itself was a weak and decentralized political entity. By the end
of the fourteenth century, it included more than one hundred principalities, each with varying
degrees of power and autonomy. The emperor was now beholden to both the rulers who elected him
and the pope, who in theory bestowed the imperial crown.

神圣罗马帝国并没有采用共同的货币、法律体系或代表大会，而是由半自治的公国拼凑而成。尽管这
些都变得相对稳定，但帝国本身是一个软弱且分散的政治实体。到十四世纪末，它包括一百多个公
国，每个公国都拥有不同程度的权力和自治权。皇帝现在既要感谢选举他的统治者，也要感谢教皇，
理论上，教皇授予了皇冠。


Even subtle shifts in climate and
temperature have historically resulted in widespread demographic and ecological transformations.


历史上，即使是
气候和温度的微妙变化也会导致广泛的人口和生态变化.


Perhaps the greatest challenge in grasping the impact of climate change on the past is the
limitations of traditional historical sources. Texts and other written source materials often provide
scant information about environmental fluctuations of earlier centuries.  Historians study references to crop yields and weather fluctuations in weather
journals and tax records, along with scientific data drawn from tree rings and organic material
trapped beneath ice sheets in different parts of the world, which offer information about past
temperature fluctuations and rainfall patterns.

也许理解气候变化对过去的影响的最大挑战是传统历史资料的局限性。文本和其他书面来源材料通常
提供的有关早期几个世纪环境波动的信息很少。历史学家
研究天气期刊和税务记录中有关农作物产量和天气波动的参考文献，以及从世界各地冰盖下的树木年
轮和有机物质中提取的科学数据，这些数据提供了有关过去温度波动和降雨模式的信息.

Because
trees can live for hundreds or even
thousands of years, during which they
experience a variety of environmental
fluctuations, clues about these
changing conditions are often hidden
within the rings in their stumps. The color
and width of tree rings can provide
snapshots of past climate conditions.

由于树木可以存活数百年甚至数千年，
在此期间它们会经历各种环境波动，因
此有关这些变化条件的线索通常隐藏在
树桩的年轮中. 树木年轮
的颜色和宽度可以提供过去气候条件的
快照.


At the beginning of the fourteenth century, subtle shifts in global mean temperature and rainfall had
a profound impact on the climate of the Northern Hemisphere, unleashing devastating famines and
plagues across Afro-Eurasia. In an era during which many people survived on
subsistence agriculture, even the slightest change in seasonal weather patterns could devastate
crops and result in widespread malnourishment and starvation. Poor nutrition weakens human
immune systems, which left many more vulnerable to the ravages of epidemic diseases.
This was especially the case when the bubonic plague struck much of Afro-Eurasia by the middle of
the century.


十四世纪初，全球平均气温和降雨量的微妙变化对北半球的气候产生了深远的影响，在非洲-欧亚大陆
引发了毁灭性的饥荒和瘟疫。在一个许多人靠自给农业生存的时代，即使季节性天气模式发生最轻微的变
化也可能毁坏农作物并导致广泛的营养不良和饥饿。营养不良会削弱人类的免疫系统，使许多人更容易受到流行病的侵袭。当本世纪中叶黑
死病袭击了非洲-欧亚大陆的大部分地区时，情况尤其如此。


Long-term weather fluctuations, during which
periods of relative warmth and cold alternated over hundreds of years, have long been part of Earth’s
ecological landscape and the narrative of environmental history.

长期
的天气波动，即相对温暖和寒冷的时期交替长达数百年，长期以来一直是地球生态景观和环境历史叙
述的一部分。


In the fourteenth century in particular, the Little Ice Age, a period of unusually cold weather that
affected most of the Northern Hemisphere, led to significant variations in normal
rainfall and a general drop in the mean annual temperature. Preceded by a Medieval Warm Period,
a span of more temperate climate across the globe from the tenth through the thirteenth century, the
cool temperatures and, in some areas, droughts radically reduced available resources and food
supplies. Aggravated by rising population levels and declining agricultural productivity, food
shortages caused significant hardship and financial distress as famine became commonplace and
competition for resources intensified.

特别是在 14 世纪，小冰河时期是影响北半球大部分地区的异常寒冷天气时期，导致正常
降雨量发生显着变化，年平均气温普遍下降。在中世纪温暖期之前，从十世纪到十三世纪，全球气候
更加温和，凉爽的气温以及某些地区的干旱极大地减少了可用资源和粮食供应。由于人口数量增加和
农业生产力下降，粮食短缺造成了严重的困难和财政困难，饥荒变得普遍，资源竞争加剧。


The Little Ice Age. This chart depicts the shift in the Northern Hemisphere’s temperature over the last millennium,
including the Medieval Warm Period that began in the tenth century and the Little Ice Age that ran from the fourteenth century to
approximately 1850.

期。

Although a consensus about the causes of the Little Ice Age remains elusive, possible triggers may
have included changes in ocean circulation patterns, shifts in the earth’s orbit, and several massive
volcanic eruptions in the tropics that released clouds of sulfate particles into the atmosphere and
reflected solar energy back into space at the end of the thirteenth century. Ultimately, these
environmental changes resulted in an advance of mountain glaciers and an overall mean global
temperature decrease of 0.6°C (with some areas experiencing as much as a two-degree drop in
annual temperature). This decrease may seem insignificant, but in the absence of modern
agricultural and irrigation techniques, it led to catastrophic crop failures and widespread famine in
many parts of the Northern Hemisphere within the first few decades of the fourteenth century. The
increase in glacier growth, moreover, affected many regions of the world, because the more water
turned to ice, the less was available to evaporate and turn into rain. As a result, even areas far from
glacial mountains suffered prolonged periods of drought.

尽管关于小冰期成因的共识尚未达成，但可能的触发因素可能包括海洋环流模式的变化、地球轨道的
变化以及热带地区的几次大规模火山喷发，火山喷发将硫酸盐颗粒云释放到大气中并反射十三世纪
末，太阳能重新进入太空。最终，这些环境变化导致山地冰川推进，全球平均气温总体下降 0.6°C（某
些地区年气温下降多达两度）。这种减少看似微不足道，但在缺乏现代农业和灌溉技术的情况下，在
十四世纪的最初几十年内，它导致了北半球许多地区灾难性的农作物歉收和大范围的饥荒。此外，冰
川增长的增加影响了世界许多地区，因为更多的水变成冰，可蒸发并转化为雨水的水就越少。结果，
即使是远离冰川山脉的地区也遭受了长期干旱。




Despite their global impact, the effects of the Little Ice Age were not the same everywhere. In the
Mediterranean and West Africa, irregular rainfall and periods of drought dramatically reduced crop
yields, whereas in China and northern Europe, cold weather and the freezing of lakes and rivers were
especially pronounced. Elsewhere in Europe and Asia, in 1314, extraordinary rains began to fall that
introduced a period of abnormally cold and wet winters. This deluge of precipitation resulted in poor
harvests as people struggled to cultivate already overworked land.

尽管影响全球，但小冰河时代的影响在各地并不相同。在地中海和西非，不规则的降雨和干旱使农作
物产量大幅下降，而在中国和北欧，寒冷的天气以及湖泊和河流的结冰尤为明显。 1314年，在欧洲和
亚洲的其他地方，暴雨开始降临，导致了异常寒冷和潮湿的冬季。由于人们努力耕种已经过度劳作的
土地，大量降水导致收成不佳。

Although the Little Ice Age was especially devastating in the 1300s, its effects persisted for many
centuries.

尽管小冰河时期在 1300 年代造成的破坏尤其严重，但其影响却持续了许多个世纪。


The period known as the Great Famine of 1315–1317 was a direct result of the Little Ice Age in much
of Europe north of the Alps, an area of roughly 400,000 square miles. This widespread and prolonged
food shortage prompted one of the worst population collapses in Europe’s recorded history. It is
virtually impossible to know the actual death toll, but it is likely that up to 10 percent of northern
Europe’s population of more than thirty million perished. Even though crop yields began to rebound
in 1317, it took several more years for them to return to prefamine levels.  Prolonged food shortages also led to widespread political and
economic instability. Ultimately, the Great
Famine led many to question the ability of church officials and monarchs to respond effectively to
crises and catastrophes, which had long-term effects on public trust in these institutions.

1315年至1317年的大饥荒时期是阿尔卑斯山以北欧洲大部分地区（面积约40万平方英里）小冰河时期
的直接结果。这种广泛而长期的粮食短缺导致了欧洲有记录以来最严重的人口崩溃之一。实际上不可
能知道实际死亡人数，但北欧 3000 万以上的人口中，很可能有 10% 死亡。尽管农作物产量在 1317
年开始反弹，但又花了几年时间才恢复到饥荒前的水平。长
期的粮食短缺还导致了广泛的政治和经济不稳定。最终，大饥荒导致许多人质疑教会官员和君主有效应对危机和灾难的能力，
这对公众对这些机构的信任产生了长期影响。


hunger grew in the land. Meat and eggs began to run out, capons and
fowl could hardly be found, animals died of pest, swine could not be fed because of
the excessive price of fodder. The land was so oppressed with want that when
the king came to St. Albans on the feast of St. Laurence [August 10] it was hardly
possible to find bread on sale to supply his immediate household. . . .

饥饿在这片土地上蔓延。 。

无法饲养。。这片土地极度匮乏，以至于当国王在圣劳伦斯节（8 月 10
日）来到圣奥尔本斯时，几乎不可能找到出售的面包来供应他的直系亲属。 。 。


The summer rains were so heavy that grain could not ripen. It
could hardly be gathered and used to bake bread down to the said feast day unless it
was first put in vessels to dry.  Bread did not have its usual
nourishing power and strength because the grain was not nourished by the warmth of
summer sunshine. Hence those who ate it, even in large quantities, were hungry
again after a little while.

夏天的雨太大了，谷物无法成

The usual kinds of meat, suitable for eating, were too scarce; horse meat was
precious; plump dogs were stolen. And, according to many reports, men and women
in many places secretly ate their own children.

适合食用的常见肉类太少了；马肉很珍贵；
胖乎乎的狗被偷了。而且，根据许多报道，许多地方的男人和女人偷偷地吃掉了自己的
孩子。


Salt was an important staple for food preservation. How might a significant rise in the
price of salt affect everyday life?

盐是保存食物的重要主食。盐价大幅上涨将如何影响日常生活？


With very few options to remedy the devastation wrought by years of poor weather and famine, most
people had little practical recourse other than migrating in search of better conditions. The
collective anxiety and social tension of the era sometimes led to scapegoating, including
persecutions of supposed witches. Although this type of persecution was by no
means universal.

由于多年来恶劣天气和饥荒造成的破坏，几乎没有什么选择可以补救，大多数人除了迁徙以寻求更好
的条件外，几乎没有其他实际的办法。这个时代的集体焦虑和社会紧张有时会导致替罪羊，包括对所
谓女巫的迫害. 尽管这种迫害绝不是普遍的.




Travel was also a common requirement of religious devotion in the tradition of pilgrimage. Muslims
desired and were even obligated, by one of the “pillars” of Islam, to complete the hajj, a visit to
Mecca and Medina, the holy sites of their faith in modern Saudi Arabia. Many Christian faithful
wanted to travel to sacred sites containing relics of the saints, believed to be imbued with special
power, and also to the Holy City of Jerusalem, believed to be the site of Jesus’s crucifixion and
resurrection. The surrounding area was the birthplace of the Christian Church. Jerusalem was also
the site of the holiest of holies of Judaism, the most sacred of spaces where the Temple of Solomon
had stood until its destruction by the Romans.

旅行也是朝圣传统中宗教信仰的常见要求。穆斯林渴望、甚至有义务，伊斯兰教的“支柱”之一完成朝
觐，访问麦加和麦地那 ，这是他们在现代沙特阿拉伯的信仰圣地。许多基督教徒想去圣地旅行，那里
有圣人的遗物，被认为具有特殊的力量，也想去圣城耶路撒冷，据信是耶稣被钉十字架和复活的地
方。周边地区是基督教会的发源地。耶路撒冷也是犹太教最神圣的地方，所罗门圣殿在被罗马人摧毁
之前一直矗立在那里，是最神圣的地方。


Beyond the demands of trade and religion, however, travel was far less possible for all but a small
elite who could afford the time and expense required.

然而，除了贸易和宗教的需求之外，除了少数能够负担得起所需时间和费用的精英之外，所有人都不
太可能旅行。

At the same time, worsening environmental conditions necessitated travel by many who would
rarely have ventured beyond their immediate surroundings but now migrated in search of the
resources they needed to survive. Leaving behind all that was familiar in the hope of finding a more
stable and hospitable environment, they faced a variety of perils, including regional disputes,
adverse weather conditions, illness, and banditry. It was difficult to arrange travel between the many
different political entities that existed in the fourteenth century, and crossing borders could be
exceptionally risky without the security provided by the presence of established networks or patrons,
especially when it came to bandits and lack of access to safe waystations to rest. Moreover, at a
time when people were struggling to secure basic necessities, travel was very expensive. Horses,
carts, camels, and seafaring vessels were beyond the means of most people, so walking became
the most common means of transportation for those in search of new opportunities and resources.
Walking eight to ten hours a day, on poor roads and at times in poor weather conditions, likely made
the experience all the more grueling for migrants who were already malnourished, weak, and
vulnerable to opportunistic infections.

与此同时，日益恶化的环境条件使得许多人不得不外出旅行，他们很少冒险走出周围的环境，但现在
却为了寻找生存所需的资源而迁移。他们抛弃了一切熟悉的事物，希望找到一个更稳定、更友善的环
境，但他们面临着各种危险，包括地区争端、恶劣的天气条件、疾病和土匪行为。在十四世纪存在的
许多不同政治实体之间安排旅行是很困难的，如果没有既定网络或赞助人的存在所提供的安全保障，
跨越边界可能会异常危险，特别是当涉及强盗和缺乏接触渠道时。安全的休息站。此外，在人们难以
获得基本必需品的时代，旅行非常昂贵。马、马车、骆驼和海船对大多数人来说是无法承受的，因此
步行成为那些寻找新机会和资源的人最常见的交通工具。每天步行八到十个小时，在糟糕的道路上，
有时还要在恶劣的天气条件下行走，对于本来就营养不良、虚弱且容易受到机会感染的移民来说，这
种经历可能会更加艰难。


Although some people traveled back and forth across borders, the difficulties and expense of
fourteenth-century travel made round trips uncommon. Many were forced to abandon their homes
knowing they would likely never return. In times of drought and food shortages, these climate
refugees faced precarious situations and uncertain prospects. They could become “strangers in
strange lands,” foreigners whose unique customs and cultural practices—including religious
traditions, dress, and language—marked them as “other” and worthy of scorn.

尽管有些人跨境旅行，但十四世纪旅行的困难和费用使得往返旅行并不常见。许多人被迫离开家园，
因为他们知道自己可能永远不会回来。在干旱和粮食短缺时期，这些气候难民面临着不稳定的处境和
不确定的前景。他们可能成为“异国他乡的陌生人”，这些外国人的独特习俗和文化习俗——包括宗教传
统、服饰和语言——使他们成为“异类”并值得蔑视。


After the plague had run its course by the 1350s, it recurred in cyclical fashion several times during
the second half of the fourteenth century. It was never fully eradicated.

瘟疫在 1350 年代结束后，在 14 世纪下半叶周期性地复发了几次。它从未被完全根除.



The bubonic plague, the most common variant of the disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia
pestis, raises egg-shaped swellings known as buboes near an afflicted person’s lymph nodes in the
groin, underarm, and upper neck areas.  For the vast majority in the Middle Ages, death generally occurred within
three days.

The disease has a mortality rate ranging from 30 to 80 percent, which is significantly higher than that of the deadliest smallpox, influenza, and polio pandemics of the modern era.

黑死病是由鼠疫耶尔森氏菌引起的最常见的疾病变种，它会在患者腹股沟、腋下和上颈部区域的淋巴
结附近产生蛋形肿胀，称为腹股沟淋巴结炎。对于中世纪的绝大多数人来说，死亡通常发生在三天内。这种死亡率为 30% 至 80% 的疾病, (其致死率)明显高于现
代最致命的天花、流感和脊髓灰质炎大流行。

Although in its
bubonic form the plague could not be spread from human to human, the rat flea became a major
plague vector.  The black rat was one of the most capable animal hosts for the plague-carrying fleas. It was highly
susceptible to the disease itself.

尽管鼠疫在鼠疫形式下无法在人与人之间传播，但鼠蚤成为主要的鼠疫媒介. 黑鼠是携带鼠疫跳蚤的最有能力的动物宿主之一。它本身就很容易感染这种疾病.

Plague-bearing fleas generally preferred to feed on small rodents such as rats and marmots, but
when their rodent hosts succumbed to the plague, they secured their next meal from the nearest
human. Two even deadlier variants of the disease eventually emerged during the fourteenth century:
pneumonic and septicemic. The pneumonic form directly infected the lungs and was spread from
person to person by coughing, with a mortality rate of 95 to 100 percent. The septicemic variant,
which resulted from plague bacteria circulating directly into the bloodstream, was invariably fatal
and, according to contemporary observers, seemed to kill within hours of the first onset of
symptoms. While historians had surmised for many decades that the plague had spread in primarily
one form (bubonic) and in one direction (east to west), new evidence increasingly suggests there
was a far greater diversity of spread.

携带瘟疫的跳蚤通常更喜欢以老鼠和土拨鼠等小型啮齿动物为食，但当它们的啮齿动物宿主死于瘟疫
时，它们会从最近的人类那里获得下一顿饭。在十四世纪，这种疾病最终出现了两种更致命的变种：
肺炎型和败血症型。肺炎形式直接感染肺部，并通过咳嗽在人与人之间传播，死亡率为 95% 至
100%。这种败血症变异是由鼠疫细菌直接循环到血液中引起的，总是致命的，根据当代观察家的说
法，似乎在首次出现症状后数小时内就会死亡。虽然历史学家几十年来一直猜测鼠疫主要以一种形式
（腺鼠疫）和一个方向（从东到西）传播，但新的证据越来越多地表明，鼠疫的传播方式更加多样
化。

The desperation incited by the plague’s relentless assault often
led to scapegoating of marginalized populations.

瘟疫的无情袭击所引发的绝望常常导
致边缘化人群成为替罪羊.


New scientific techniques such as genetic
testing are strongly suggesting that the plague developed far earlier than modern historians had
believed. In its most well-documented form, it ultimately spread along international sea and land
trade routes in the 1340s and by 1409 had reached port cities of the Indian Ocean trade network in
East Africa.

基因测试等新的科学技术强烈表
明，鼠疫的发展远比现代历史学家认为的要早。在其最有据可查的形式中，它最终在 1340 年代沿着国
际海上和陆地贸易路线传播，到 1409 年已经到达东非印度洋贸易网络的港口城市.

Although the exact date of the Black Death’s arrival in China remains unknown, Chinese historical
records first refer to the appearance of a deadly epidemic in the years from 1331 to 1334. For those
living in China, the devastation likely seemed to portend the withdrawal of the Mandate of Heaven
from the rulers of the Yuan dynasty. Epidemics, droughts, and other catastrophes could be perceived
as omens of divine displeasure and an indication that a ruler had lost divine support.

尽管黑死病传入中国的确切日期仍不得而知，但中国的历史记录首先提到了1331年至1334年期间出现
的致命流行病。大约有一千三百万人在这次致命的疫
情中丧生。对于生活在中国的人们来说，这场灾难似乎预示着元朝统治者将收回天命。流行病、干旱
和其他灾难可能被视为神圣不悦的预兆，并表明统治者失去了神圣的支持。

After ravaging China, the plague continued to spread west along trade routes by land and sea that
eventually enabled it to engulf much of the Middle East.  Cities such as Tabriz in Iran that had long served as thriving centers of trade
were largely abandoned by the 1340s, when foreign merchants abruptly fled the city and commerce
plummeted.

在肆虐中国之后，瘟疫继续沿着陆路和海上贸易路线向西传播，最终席卷了中东大部分地区。在肆虐中国之后，瘟疫继续沿着陆路和海上贸易路线向西传播，最终席卷了中东大部分地区。

Although the mortality rate across the Middle East was high, much of our
knowledge of the plague’s impact in the Muslim world comes from historical documentation of its
impact on the Mamluk Empire (1250–1517), which suffered a population loss of roughly one-third.

尽管整个中东地区的死亡率很高，但我们对瘟疫对穆斯林世界
影响的了解大部分来自于它对马穆鲁克帝国（1250-1517）影响的历史记录，该帝国的人口损失了大约
三分之一。
