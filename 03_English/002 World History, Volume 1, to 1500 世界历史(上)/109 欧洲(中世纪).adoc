The fourteenth century was generally an era of chronic conflict and instability for most of the continent.

对于欧洲大陆的大部分地区 来说，14世纪总体上是一个长期冲突和不稳定的时代

The Fourteenth Century Begins. This map depicts the patchwork of kingdoms and political entities in Europe and beyond at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The many divisions ensured that political fragmentation rather than centralization defined the region throughout the medieval period, and many states depicted here still lacked a strong, centralized rule entirely.

十四世纪开始。这张地图描绘了十四世纪初欧洲及其他地区的王国和政治实体的拼凑而成。在整个中世纪时期，许多分裂确保了 该地区的政治分裂而不是集权，并且这里描绘的许多国家仍然完全缺乏强大的集权统治。

In contrast to the stability that had defined much of the thirteenth century for the European Christian Church, it began experiencing significant destabilization in the beginning of the fourteenth century, when tensions between the pope and national monarchs led to a weakening of papal authority and division within the church.

与欧洲基督教会在 13 世纪的大部分时间里保持稳定相反，它在 14 世纪初开始经历严重的不稳定，当 时教皇和国家君主之间的紧张关系导致教皇权威的削弱和教会内部的分裂。

The Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453) erupted between England and France over claims to French lands held by the English monarch.

英国和法国之间爆发了百年战争（1337-1453），争夺英国君主所拥有的法国土地。

Another center of political instability during this period was the Holy Roman Empire. In the fourteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire, which had been founded by Charlemagne in 800, comprised four main entities—the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Germany (including lands that now are part of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), the Kingdom of Burgundy (a region in southeastern France), and the Kingdom of Bohemia (what is now the Czech Republic and part of Poland) under the nominal control of an elected emperor. Each of these kingdoms, in turn, was composed of a loose coalition of independent territories with different hereditary rulers. The emperor was chosen by a handful of these rulers known as electors.

这一时期另一个政治不稳定的中心是神圣罗马帝国。十四世纪，神圣罗马帝国由查理曼于 800 年建 立，由四个主要实体组成：意大利王国、德意志王国（包括现在属于比利时、荷兰、德国、奥地利、 和瑞士）、勃艮第王国（法国东南部的一个地区）和波西米亚王国（现在的捷克共和国和波兰的一部 分）在当选皇帝的名义控制下。这些王国又都是由具有不同世袭统治者的独立领土的松散联盟组成。 皇帝是由少数被称为选举人的统治者选出的。

Rather than adopting a common currency, legal system, or representative assembly, the Holy Roman Empire remained a patchwork of semiautonomous principalities. Although each of these became relatively stable, the empire itself was a weak and decentralized political entity. By the end of the fourteenth century, it included more than one hundred principalities, each with varying degrees of power and autonomy. The emperor was now beholden to both the rulers who elected him and the pope, who in theory bestowed the imperial crown.

神圣罗马帝国并没有采用共同的货币、法律体系或代表大会，而是由半自治的公国拼凑而成。尽管这 些都变得相对稳定，但帝国本身是一个软弱且分散的政治实体。到十四世纪末，它包括一百多个公 国，每个公国都拥有不同程度的权力和自治权。皇帝现在既要感谢选举他的统治者，也要感谢教皇， 理论上，教皇授予了皇冠。

Even subtle shifts in climate and temperature have historically resulted in widespread demographic and ecological transformations.

历史上，即使是 气候和温度的微妙变化也会导致广泛的人口和生态变化.

Perhaps the greatest challenge in grasping the impact of climate change on the past is the limitations of traditional historical sources. Texts and other written source materials often provide scant information about environmental fluctuations of earlier centuries. Historians study references to crop yields and weather fluctuations in weather journals and tax records, along with scientific data drawn from tree rings and organic material trapped beneath ice sheets in different parts of the world, which offer information about past temperature fluctuations and rainfall patterns.

也许理解气候变化对过去的影响的最大挑战是传统历史资料的局限性。文本和其他书面来源材料通常 提供的有关早期几个世纪环境波动的信息很少。历史学家 研究天气期刊和税务记录中有关农作物产量和天气波动的参考文献，以及从世界各地冰盖下的树木年 轮和有机物质中提取的科学数据，这些数据提供了有关过去温度波动和降雨模式的信息.

Because trees can live for hundreds or even thousands of years, during which they experience a variety of environmental fluctuations, clues about these changing conditions are often hidden within the rings in their stumps. The color and width of tree rings can provide snapshots of past climate conditions.

由于树木可以存活数百年甚至数千年， 在此期间它们会经历各种环境波动，因 此有关这些变化条件的线索通常隐藏在 树桩的年轮中. 树木年轮 的颜色和宽度可以提供过去气候条件的 快照.

At the beginning of the fourteenth century, subtle shifts in global mean temperature and rainfall had a profound impact on the climate of the Northern Hemisphere, unleashing devastating famines and plagues across Afro-Eurasia. In an era during which many people survived on subsistence agriculture, even the slightest change in seasonal weather patterns could devastate crops and result in widespread malnourishment and starvation. Poor nutrition weakens human immune systems, which left many more vulnerable to the ravages of epidemic diseases. This was especially the case when the bubonic plague struck much of Afro-Eurasia by the middle of the century.

十四世纪初，全球平均气温和降雨量的微妙变化对北半球的气候产生了深远的影响，在非洲-欧亚大陆 引发了毁灭性的饥荒和瘟疫。在一个许多人靠自给农业生存的时代，即使季节性天气模式发生最轻微的变 化也可能毁坏农作物并导致广泛的营养不良和饥饿。营养不良会削弱人类的免疫系统，使许多人更容易受到流行病的侵袭。当本世纪中叶黑 死病袭击了非洲-欧亚大陆的大部分地区时，情况尤其如此。

Long-term weather fluctuations, during which periods of relative warmth and cold alternated over hundreds of years, have long been part of Earth’s ecological landscape and the narrative of environmental history.

长期 的天气波动，即相对温暖和寒冷的时期交替长达数百年，长期以来一直是地球生态景观和环境历史叙 述的一部分。

In the fourteenth century in particular, the Little Ice Age, a period of unusually cold weather that affected most of the Northern Hemisphere, led to significant variations in normal rainfall and a general drop in the mean annual temperature. Preceded by a Medieval Warm Period, a span of more temperate climate across the globe from the tenth through the thirteenth century, the cool temperatures and, in some areas, droughts radically reduced available resources and food supplies. Aggravated by rising population levels and declining agricultural productivity, food shortages caused significant hardship and financial distress as famine became commonplace and competition for resources intensified.

特别是在 14 世纪，小冰河时期是影响北半球大部分地区的异常寒冷天气时期，导致正常 降雨量发生显着变化，年平均气温普遍下降。在中世纪温暖期之前，从十世纪到十三世纪，全球气候 更加温和，凉爽的气温以及某些地区的干旱极大地减少了可用资源和粮食供应。由于人口数量增加和 农业生产力下降，粮食短缺造成了严重的困难和财政困难，饥荒变得普遍，资源竞争加剧。

The Little Ice Age. This chart depicts the shift in the Northern Hemisphere’s temperature over the last millennium, including the Medieval Warm Period that began in the tenth century and the Little Ice Age that ran from the fourteenth century to approximately 1850.

小冰河时代。这张图表描绘了北半球近千年来的气温变化，包括从10世纪开始的中世纪温暖期和从14世纪到1850年左右的小冰 期。

image:/img/0029.jpg[,100%]

Although a consensus about the causes of the Little Ice Age remains elusive, possible triggers may have included changes in ocean circulation patterns, shifts in the earth’s orbit, and several massive volcanic eruptions in the tropics that released clouds of sulfate particles into the atmosphere and reflected solar energy back into space at the end of the thirteenth century. Ultimately, these environmental changes resulted in an advance of mountain glaciers and an overall mean global temperature decrease of 0.6°C (with some areas experiencing as much as a two-degree drop in annual temperature). This decrease may seem insignificant, but in the absence of modern agricultural and irrigation techniques, it led to catastrophic crop failures and widespread famine in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere within the first few decades of the fourteenth century. The increase in glacier growth, moreover, affected many regions of the world, because the more water turned to ice, the less was available to evaporate and turn into rain. As a result, even areas far from glacial mountains suffered prolonged periods of drought.

尽管关于小冰期成因的共识尚未达成，但可能的触发因素可能包括海洋环流模式的变化、地球轨道的 变化以及热带地区的几次大规模火山喷发，火山喷发将硫酸盐颗粒云释放到大气中并反射十三世纪 末，太阳能重新进入太空。最终，这些环境变化导致山地冰川推进，全球平均气温总体下降 0.6°C（某 些地区年气温下降多达两度）。这种减少看似微不足道，但在缺乏现代农业和灌溉技术的情况下，在 十四世纪的最初几十年内，它导致了北半球许多地区灾难性的农作物歉收和大范围的饥荒。此外，冰 川增长的增加影响了世界许多地区，因为更多的水变成冰，可蒸发并转化为雨水的水就越少。结果， 即使是远离冰川山脉的地区也遭受了长期干旱。

Despite their global impact, the effects of the Little Ice Age were not the same everywhere. In the Mediterranean and West Africa, irregular rainfall and periods of drought dramatically reduced crop yields, whereas in China and northern Europe, cold weather and the freezing of lakes and rivers were especially pronounced. Elsewhere in Europe and Asia, in 1314, extraordinary rains began to fall that introduced a period of abnormally cold and wet winters. This deluge of precipitation resulted in poor harvests as people struggled to cultivate already overworked land.

尽管影响全球，但小冰河时代的影响在各地并不相同。在地中海和西非，不规则的降雨和干旱使农作 物产量大幅下降，而在中国和北欧，寒冷的天气以及湖泊和河流的结冰尤为明显。 1314年，在欧洲和 亚洲的其他地方，暴雨开始降临，导致了异常寒冷和潮湿的冬季。由于人们努力耕种已经过度劳作的 土地，大量降水导致收成不佳。

Although the Little Ice Age was especially devastating in the 1300s, its effects persisted for many centuries.

尽管小冰河时期在 1300 年代造成的破坏尤其严重，但其影响却持续了许多个世纪。

The period known as the Great Famine of 1315–1317 was a direct result of the Little Ice Age in much of Europe north of the Alps, an area of roughly 400,000 square miles. This widespread and prolonged food shortage prompted one of the worst population collapses in Europe’s recorded history. It is virtually impossible to know the actual death toll, but it is likely that up to 10 percent of northern Europe’s population of more than thirty million perished. Even though crop yields began to rebound in 1317, it took several more years for them to return to prefamine levels. Prolonged food shortages also led to widespread political and economic instability. Ultimately, the Great Famine led many to question the ability of church officials and monarchs to respond effectively to crises and catastrophes, which had long-term effects on public trust in these institutions.

1315年至1317年的大饥荒时期是阿尔卑斯山以北欧洲大部分地区（面积约40万平方英里）小冰河时期 的直接结果。这种广泛而长期的粮食短缺导致了欧洲有记录以来最严重的人口崩溃之一。实际上不可 能知道实际死亡人数，但北欧 3000 万以上的人口中，很可能有 10% 死亡。尽管农作物产量在 1317 年开始反弹，但又花了几年时间才恢复到饥荒前的水平。长 期的粮食短缺还导致了广泛的政治和经济不稳定。最终，大饥荒导致许多人质疑教会官员和君主有效应对危机和灾难的能力， 这对公众对这些机构的信任产生了长期影响。

hunger grew in the land. Meat and eggs began to run out, capons and fowl could hardly be found, animals died of pest, swine could not be fed because of the excessive price of fodder. The land was so oppressed with want that when the king came to St. Albans on the feast of St. Laurence [August 10] it was hardly possible to find bread on sale to supply his immediate household. . . .

饥饿在这片土地上蔓延。 。 。 。肉和蛋开始枯竭，阉鸡和家禽几乎找不到，动物死于害虫，猪因饲料价格过高而 无法饲养。。这片土地极度匮乏，以至于当国王在圣劳伦斯节（8 月 10 日）来到圣奥尔本斯时，几乎不可能找到出售的面包来供应他的直系亲属。 。 。

The summer rains were so heavy that grain could not ripen. It could hardly be gathered and used to bake bread down to the said feast day unless it was first put in vessels to dry. Bread did not have its usual nourishing power and strength because the grain was not nourished by the warmth of summer sunshine. Hence those who ate it, even in large quantities, were hungry again after a little while.

夏天的雨太大了，谷物无法成 熟。除非先将其放入容器中干燥，否则很难将其收集起来并用于在上述节日期间烘烤面 包. 面包 没有平常的滋养力和强度，因为谷物没有受到夏日温暖阳光的滋养。因此，吃的人，即 使吃得很多，过了一会儿又饿了

The usual kinds of meat, suitable for eating, were too scarce; horse meat was precious; plump dogs were stolen. And, according to many reports, men and women in many places secretly ate their own children.

适合食用的常见肉类太少了；马肉很珍贵； 胖乎乎的狗被偷了。而且，根据许多报道，许多地方的男人和女人偷偷地吃掉了自己的 孩子。

Salt was an important staple for food preservation. How might a significant rise in the price of salt affect everyday life?

盐是保存食物的重要主食。盐价大幅上涨将如何影响日常生活？

With very few options to remedy the devastation wrought by years of poor weather and famine, most people had little practical recourse other than migrating in search of better conditions. The collective anxiety and social tension of the era sometimes led to scapegoating, including persecutions of supposed witches. Although this type of persecution was by no means universal.

由于多年来恶劣天气和饥荒造成的破坏，几乎没有什么选择可以补救，大多数人除了迁徙以寻求更好 的条件外，几乎没有其他实际的办法。这个时代的集体焦虑和社会紧张有时会导致替罪羊，包括对所 谓女巫的迫害. 尽管这种迫害绝不是普遍的.

Travel was also a common requirement of religious devotion in the tradition of pilgrimage. Muslims desired and were even obligated, by one of the “pillars” of Islam, to complete the hajj, a visit to Mecca and Medina, the holy sites of their faith in modern Saudi Arabia. Many Christian faithful wanted to travel to sacred sites containing relics of the saints, believed to be imbued with special power, and also to the Holy City of Jerusalem, believed to be the site of Jesus’s crucifixion and resurrection. The surrounding area was the birthplace of the Christian Church. Jerusalem was also the site of the holiest of holies of Judaism, the most sacred of spaces where the Temple of Solomon had stood until its destruction by the Romans.

旅行也是朝圣传统中宗教信仰的常见要求。穆斯林渴望、甚至有义务，伊斯兰教的“支柱”之一完成朝 觐，访问麦加和麦地那 ，这是他们在现代沙特阿拉伯的信仰圣地。许多基督教徒想去圣地旅行，那里 有圣人的遗物，被认为具有特殊的力量，也想去圣城耶路撒冷，据信是耶稣被钉十字架和复活的地 方。周边地区是基督教会的发源地。耶路撒冷也是犹太教最神圣的地方，所罗门圣殿在被罗马人摧毁 之前一直矗立在那里，是最神圣的地方。

Beyond the demands of trade and religion, however, travel was far less possible for all but a small elite who could afford the time and expense required.

然而，除了贸易和宗教的需求之外，除了少数能够负担得起所需时间和费用的精英之外，所有人都不 太可能旅行。

At the same time, worsening environmental conditions necessitated travel by many who would rarely have ventured beyond their immediate surroundings but now migrated in search of the resources they needed to survive. Leaving behind all that was familiar in the hope of finding a more stable and hospitable environment, they faced a variety of perils, including regional disputes, adverse weather conditions, illness, and banditry. It was difficult to arrange travel between the many different political entities that existed in the fourteenth century, and crossing borders could be exceptionally risky without the security provided by the presence of established networks or patrons, especially when it came to bandits and lack of access to safe waystations to rest. Moreover, at a time when people were struggling to secure basic necessities, travel was very expensive. Horses, carts, camels, and seafaring vessels were beyond the means of most people, so walking became the most common means of transportation for those in search of new opportunities and resources. Walking eight to ten hours a day, on poor roads and at times in poor weather conditions, likely made the experience all the more grueling for migrants who were already malnourished, weak, and vulnerable to opportunistic infections.

与此同时，日益恶化的环境条件使得许多人不得不外出旅行，他们很少冒险走出周围的环境，但现在 却为了寻找生存所需的资源而迁移。他们抛弃了一切熟悉的事物，希望找到一个更稳定、更友善的环 境，但他们面临着各种危险，包括地区争端、恶劣的天气条件、疾病和土匪行为。在十四世纪存在的 许多不同政治实体之间安排旅行是很困难的，如果没有既定网络或赞助人的存在所提供的安全保障， 跨越边界可能会异常危险，特别是当涉及强盗和缺乏接触渠道时。安全的休息站。此外，在人们难以 获得基本必需品的时代，旅行非常昂贵。马、马车、骆驼和海船对大多数人来说是无法承受的，因此 步行成为那些寻找新机会和资源的人最常见的交通工具。每天步行八到十个小时，在糟糕的道路上， 有时还要在恶劣的天气条件下行走，对于本来就营养不良、虚弱且容易受到机会感染的移民来说，这 种经历可能会更加艰难。

Although some people traveled back and forth across borders, the difficulties and expense of fourteenth-century travel made round trips uncommon. Many were forced to abandon their homes knowing they would likely never return. In times of drought and food shortages, these climate refugees faced precarious situations and uncertain prospects. They could become “strangers in strange lands,” foreigners whose unique customs and cultural practices—including religious traditions, dress, and language—marked them as “other” and worthy of scorn.

尽管有些人跨境旅行，但十四世纪旅行的困难和费用使得往返旅行并不常见。许多人被迫离开家园， 因为他们知道自己可能永远不会回来。在干旱和粮食短缺时期，这些气候难民面临着不稳定的处境和 不确定的前景。他们可能成为“异国他乡的陌生人”，这些外国人的独特习俗和文化习俗——包括宗教传 统、服饰和语言——使他们成为“异类”并值得蔑视。

After the plague had run its course by the 1350s, it recurred in cyclical fashion several times during the second half of the fourteenth century. It was never fully eradicated.

瘟疫在 1350 年代结束后，在 14 世纪下半叶周期性地复发了几次。它从未被完全根除.

The bubonic plague, the most common variant of the disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, raises egg-shaped swellings known as buboes near an afflicted person’s lymph nodes in the groin, underarm, and upper neck areas. For the vast majority in the Middle Ages, death generally occurred within three days.

The disease has a mortality rate ranging from 30 to 80 percent, which is significantly higher than that of the deadliest smallpox, influenza, and polio pandemics of the modern era.

黑死病是由鼠疫耶尔森氏菌引起的最常见的疾病变种，它会在患者腹股沟、腋下和上颈部区域的淋巴 结附近产生蛋形肿胀，称为腹股沟淋巴结炎。对于中世纪的绝大多数人来说，死亡通常发生在三天内。这种死亡率为 30% 至 80% 的疾病, (其致死率)明显高于现 代最致命的天花、流感和脊髓灰质炎大流行。

Although in its bubonic form the plague could not be spread from human to human, the rat flea became a major plague vector. The black rat was one of the most capable animal hosts for the plague-carrying fleas. It was highly susceptible to the disease itself.

尽管鼠疫在鼠疫形式下无法在人与人之间传播，但鼠蚤成为主要的鼠疫媒介. 黑鼠是携带鼠疫跳蚤的最有能力的动物宿主之一。它本身就很容易感染这种疾病.

Plague-bearing fleas generally preferred to feed on small rodents such as rats and marmots, but when their rodent hosts succumbed to the plague, they secured their next meal from the nearest human. Two even deadlier variants of the disease eventually emerged during the fourteenth century: pneumonic and septicemic. The pneumonic form directly infected the lungs and was spread from person to person by coughing, with a mortality rate of 95 to 100 percent. The septicemic variant, which resulted from plague bacteria circulating directly into the bloodstream, was invariably fatal and, according to contemporary observers, seemed to kill within hours of the first onset of symptoms. While historians had surmised for many decades that the plague had spread in primarily one form (bubonic) and in one direction (east to west), new evidence increasingly suggests there was a far greater diversity of spread.

携带瘟疫的跳蚤通常更喜欢以老鼠和土拨鼠等小型啮齿动物为食，但当它们的啮齿动物宿主死于瘟疫 时，它们会从最近的人类那里获得下一顿饭。在十四世纪，这种疾病最终出现了两种更致命的变种： 肺炎型和败血症型。肺炎形式直接感染肺部，并通过咳嗽在人与人之间传播，死亡率为 95% 至 100%。这种败血症变异是由鼠疫细菌直接循环到血液中引起的，总是致命的，根据当代观察家的说 法，似乎在首次出现症状后数小时内就会死亡。虽然历史学家几十年来一直猜测鼠疫主要以一种形式 （腺鼠疫）和一个方向（从东到西）传播，但新的证据越来越多地表明，鼠疫的传播方式更加多样 化。

The desperation incited by the plague’s relentless assault often led to scapegoating of marginalized populations.

瘟疫的无情袭击所引发的绝望常常导 致边缘化人群成为替罪羊.

New scientific techniques such as genetic testing are strongly suggesting that the plague developed far earlier than modern historians had believed. In its most well-documented form, it ultimately spread along international sea and land trade routes in the 1340s and by 1409 had reached port cities of the Indian Ocean trade network in East Africa.

基因测试等新的科学技术强烈表 明，鼠疫的发展远比现代历史学家认为的要早。在其最有据可查的形式中，它最终在 1340 年代沿着国 际海上和陆地贸易路线传播，到 1409 年已经到达东非印度洋贸易网络的港口城市.

Although the exact date of the Black Death’s arrival in China remains unknown, Chinese historical records first refer to the appearance of a deadly epidemic in the years from 1331 to 1334. For those living in China, the devastation likely seemed to portend the withdrawal of the Mandate of Heaven from the rulers of the Yuan dynasty. Epidemics, droughts, and other catastrophes could be perceived as omens of divine displeasure and an indication that a ruler had lost divine support.

尽管黑死病传入中国的确切日期仍不得而知，但中国的历史记录首先提到了1331年至1334年期间出现 的致命流行病。大约有一千三百万人在这次致命的疫 情中丧生。对于生活在中国的人们来说，这场灾难似乎预示着元朝统治者将收回天命。流行病、干旱 和其他灾难可能被视为神圣不悦的预兆，并表明统治者失去了神圣的支持。

After ravaging China, the plague continued to spread west along trade routes by land and sea that eventually enabled it to engulf much of the Middle East. Cities such as Tabriz in Iran that had long served as thriving centers of trade were largely abandoned by the 1340s, when foreign merchants abruptly fled the city and commerce plummeted.

在肆虐中国之后，瘟疫继续沿着陆路和海上贸易路线向西传播，最终席卷了中东大部分地区。在肆虐中国之后，瘟疫继续沿着陆路和海上贸易路线向西传播，最终席卷了中东大部分地区。

Although the mortality rate across the Middle East was high, much of our knowledge of the plague’s impact in the Muslim world comes from historical documentation of its impact on the Mamluk Empire (1250–1517), which suffered a population loss of roughly one-third.

尽管整个中东地区的死亡率很高，但我们对瘟疫对穆斯林世界 影响的了解大部分来自于它对马穆鲁克帝国（1250-1517）影响的历史记录，该帝国的人口损失了大约 三分之一。

The plague spread into the European interior, leaving perhaps as many as twenty-four million dead, roughly 30 percent of the continent’s population at the time.

瘟疫传播到欧洲 内陆，导致大约 2400 万人死亡，约占当时欧洲大陆人口的 30%。

Social responses to the plague in medieval Europe ranged from increased piety to hedonism to resigned acceptance of inevitable death.

Failing to fully grasp how and why the disease was spreading, however, many of the devout turned to the clergy, who were also dying in record numbers, mostly because of their efforts to care for the sick.

中世纪欧洲对瘟疫的社会反应从日益虔 诚到享乐主义，再到放弃接受不可避免的死亡。由于无法完全掌握这种疾病传播的方式和原 因，许多虔诚的信徒转向神职人员，而神职人员的死亡人数也创历史新高，主要是因为他们努力照顾 病人。

The plague left each region it affected with long-term economic and demographic consequences. Old systems of belief came into question, and ancient social hierarchies shifted to accommodate the significant population losses that followed the plague. Peasants, laborers, and those at the lower end of the socioeconomic hierarchy tended to experience the greatest mortality, but for those who survived, pronounced labor shortages led to the demise of some industries and more favorable working conditions in others. The disadvantaged began to question whether social elites really did enjoy God’s privilege, as the social hierarchy generally preached, since they too succumbed to the plague and failed to care for those to whom they bore responsibility.

瘟疫给它所影响的每个地区带来了长期的经济和人口后果，旧的信仰体系受到质疑，古代的社会等级制度也发生了转变，以适应瘟疫后 人口的大量流失。农民、工人和处于社会经济阶层低端的人往往死亡率最高，但对于那些幸存下来的 人来说，明显的劳动力短缺导致一些行业的消亡和其他行业更有利的工作条件。弱势群体开始质疑社 会精英是否真的像社会等级制度普遍宣扬的那样享有上帝的特权，因为他们也死于瘟疫，并且没有照 顾那些他们负有责任的人。

Given massive depopulation, people increasingly chose to leave locations to which they had formerly been anchored. Peasants left the feudal estates on which their families had lived for generations, as landlords elsewhere offered more generous terms of labor to attract workers who could replace the dead. Many peasants also left the countryside to seek wage labor and employment in cities, which began experiencing significant labor shortages as a result of the plague’s staggering death toll. Because the demand for labor was so high, peasants who remained in the countryside, especially males, were now able to press their employers for more money and rights.

由于人口大量减少, 人们越来越多地选择离开他们以前居住的地方。农民们 离开了他们的家人世代居住的封建庄园，因为其他地方的地主提供了更慷慨的劳动条件来吸引可以替 代死者的工人。许多农民也离开农村到城市寻找工资劳动和就业机会，由于瘟疫造成的惊人死亡人 数，城市开始出现严重的劳动力短缺。由于对劳动力的需求如此之高，留在农村的农民，尤其是男 性，现在能够向雇主施压，要求更多的金钱和权利。

With fewer people to work their land and generate income for them, their collective wealth contracted significantly. The power of local nobles and landowners was also being eclipsed by more powerful monarchs and emerging urban economies that bolstered the growth of towns and cities.

由于耕种土地和创造收入的人越来越少，(地主)他们的集体财富大幅萎缩。当地贵族 和地主的权力也被更强大的君主和新兴城市经济所掩盖，这些经济促进了城镇的发展。

The death of many members of the clergy during the Black Death made monarchs more dependent on the merchant class to perform services for which education was required. The rising prominence of the merchant class that resulted, coupled with the growing centralization of monarchical power, gradually eroded some of the traditional privileges and prerogatives of landed elites. Although some regions of the continent, particularly the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire, remained a largely decentralized and fragmented collection of principalities, by the end of the fourteenth century, England and France had begun to lay the foundations of the centralized modern nation-state to replace the power of the nobles.

黑死病期间许多神职人员的死亡使君主更加依赖商人阶级来提供需要教育的服务。由此导致的 商人阶级的地位日益突出，加上君主权力的日益集中，逐渐侵蚀了地主精英的一些传统特权和特权。 尽管欧洲大陆的一些地区，特别是神圣罗马帝国的日耳曼土地，仍然是一个很大程度上分散和分散的 公国集合体，但到十四世纪末，英国和法国已经开始奠定中央集权的现代国家的基础。国家取代贵族 的权力。

Another impetus for the rise of centralized monarchies and the reduction of the nobility’s authority was the Hundred Years’ War. The use of new weapons and tactics rendered the cavalry-focused armies of the feudal era all but obsolete. The growth of professional armies also offered peasants the potential for social mobility,.

中央集权君主制兴起和贵族权力削弱的另一个推动力是百年战争。新武器和战术的使用使得封建时代以骑兵为主的军队几乎已经过时，职 业军队的发展也为农民提供了社会流动的潜力.

As the people of western Europe remade their societies following the collapse of the western half of the Roman Empire, the Byzantines in the east preserved Roman cultural practices for centuries, seeing themselves always as the continuation of a proud and strong Mediterranean empire. By the eleventh century, however, the Byzantines found their power challenged by the arrival of Turkic tribes such as the Seljuks, who settled in the eastern half of their domains and gradually wrested control of the area from them. As different Turkic tribes arrived and settled in the region, one group, the Ottomans, soon rose to prominence over others. The Ottomans eventually deprive the Byzantines of their last remnants of power. The fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 sent many Greek scholars and theologians fleeing to the city-states of Italy.

罗马帝国西半部崩溃后，西欧人民重建了他们的社会，而东部的拜占庭人几个世纪以来一直保留着罗 马文化习俗，始终将自己视为骄傲而强大的地中海帝国的延续。然而，到了十一世纪，拜占庭人发现 他们的权力受到塞尔柱人(后建立奥斯曼帝国)等突厥部落的到来的挑战，塞尔柱人定居在拜占庭领土的东半部，并逐渐从 拜占庭手中夺取了对该地区的控制权。随着不同的突厥部落抵达并定居在该地区，奥斯曼帝国这一部 落很快就在其他部落中脱颖而出。奥斯曼人最终剥夺了拜占庭人最后的残余权力。 1453 年拜占庭帝国的衰落导致许多希腊学者和神学家 逃往意大利城邦

(奥斯曼帝国的)巴耶济德一世很快发现自己面临着一个更强大的敌人：蒙古征服者帖木儿。

Timur was a Mongol from the Barlas tribe. He was born in central Asia, in a part of the Chagatai Khanate (now modern Uzbekistan), in the 1320s or 1330s.

帖木儿是巴拉斯部落的蒙古人，他于 1320 或 1330 年代出生于中亚察合台汗 国（现乌兹别克斯坦）的一部分。

Timur sought to rebuild the empire that Chinggis Khan had controlled at the time of his death. Because he could not establish descent from Chinggis, he could not claim the title of khan himself. In the 1360s, he gained control of part of the Chagatai Khanate.

帖木儿寻求重建成吉思汗死时所控制的帝国。因为他无法证明自己是成吉思汗的后裔，所以他自己也 不能自称为可汗。1360年代，他控制了察合台汗国的部分地区.

Timur soon looked beyond central Asia for lands to control. He taxed the inhabitants of vanquished cities heavily. Cities that did not submit were treated brutally, however.

帖木儿很快就将目光投向中亚以外的地区，寻找可以控制的土地。他向被征服城市的居民征收重税，不服从的城市受到了残酷的对待

Bayezid I had been steadily conquering weaker rulers in Anatolia and forcing them to become his vassals. However, Turkish tribes and Ottoman vassals who Bayezid I believed owed allegiance to him turned to Timur, considering him their means of achieving independence from Ottoman rule. In turn, enemies of Timur turned to Bayezid for assistance. Timur wrote to Bayezid, demanding that the Ottoman ruler cease aiding his enemies.

(奥斯曼帝国的)巴耶 济德一世一直在稳步征服安纳托利亚较弱的统治者，并迫使他们成为他的附庸。然而，巴耶济德一世认为效忠于他的土耳其 部落和奥斯曼封臣不愿屈服于他的统治，他们转向帖木儿，认为他是摆脱奥斯曼统治独立的手段。反 过来，帖木儿的敌人，则向巴耶济德寻求援助。帖木儿写信给巴耶济德，要求奥斯曼统治者停止援助他的 敌人。

In 1400, Timur struck back. He then went on to wage war against the Mamluk sultans in Egypt in Syria, preventing Bayezid from turning to them for help. He also entered into an allegiance with the Byzantines against the Ottomans.

帖木儿发起反击，他继续在叙利 亚对埃及的马穆鲁克苏丹发动战争，阻止巴耶济德向他们寻求帮助。他还与拜占庭人结盟，对抗奥斯 曼人.

One of the great weaknesses of Bayezid’s Ottoman state was revealed. The Ottomans had built their empire in Anatolia by conquering other Turkish states and absorbing their rulers and the rulers’ descendants into their administration. These men, Bayezid’s unwilling vassals, had no wish to risk their lives for their Ottoman overlords. When Timur’s forces attacked at Ankara, therefore, many of Bayezid’s Turkish vassals abandoned the field, happy to be free of Ottoman control.

巴耶济德的奥斯曼帝国的一大弱点被暴露出来。奥斯曼帝国通过征服其他土耳其 国家并将其统治者及其后裔吸收到他们的管理中,在安纳托利亚建立了他们的帝国.这些人是巴耶塞 特不情愿的封臣，他们不想为奥斯曼帝国的宗主冒生命危险。因此，当帖木儿的军队进攻安卡拉时，许多巴耶济德的土耳其封臣放弃了战场，很高兴摆脱了奥斯曼帝国的控制。奥斯曼帝国被击败.

Following his rout of the Ottomans and having conquered most of the domains of Chinggis Khan and his sons and grandsons, Timur turned eastward to claim his last prize—China. In 1368, the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China had come to an end. In December 1404, Timur set out to cross central Asia on his way to China. Within a few months, however, he fell ill, and in February 1405 he died. The invasion of China ended before it had begun.

在击败奥斯曼帝国并征服成吉思汗及其子孙的大部分领土后，帖木儿转向东方，夺取他最后的战利品 ——中国。 1368年，中国的蒙古元朝结束了。1404年 12月，帖木儿出发穿越中亚前往中国。然而几个月后，他病倒了，并于 1405 年 2 月去世。对中国的入 侵还没开始就结束了

At the time of his death, Timur had conquered much of the land claimed in the original Mongol conquests of Chinggis Khan and his descendants. Unlike them, however, Timur made no real effort to rule the places he seized outside Persia. Thus, it was relatively easy for most places that Timur had conquered to regain their independence.

帖木儿去世时，已经征服了成吉思汗及其后裔最初蒙古征服时所声称拥有的大部分土地。然而，与他 们不同的是，帖木儿并没有真正努力统治他在波斯以外夺取的土地。因此，对于帖木 儿征服的大多数地方来说，恢复独立是相对容易的。

The Timurid Empire. By the time of Timur’s death in 1405, his empire stretched from the border of Anatolia in the west to northern India in the east, and from modern Uzbekistan in the north to the Gulf of Hormuz in the south.

帖木儿帝国。到1405年帖木儿去世时，他的帝国西起安纳托利亚边境，东 至印度北部，北起现代乌兹别克斯坦，南至霍尔木兹湾。

Both Mehmed and Murad realized that in order to rebuild the Ottoman state, they had to drive out the Byzantine rulers. The Byzantine emperor Manuel II had assisted Mehmed’s rivals for the Ottoman throne, attempting to keep the Ottomans weak by prolonging the civil war. The Byzantines were also close allies of the Venetians and Genoese, who controlled trade in the Aegean and the Black Seas and whose ships could interfere with Ottoman efforts to control both sides of the Dardanelles.

(奥斯曼帝国的)穆罕默德和穆拉德都意识到，为了重建奥斯曼帝国，他们必须驱逐拜占 庭统治者。拜占庭皇帝曼努埃尔二世曾协助穆罕默德的竞争对手争夺奥斯曼帝国的王位，试图通过延 长内战来削弱奥斯曼帝国。拜占庭人也是威尼斯人和热那亚人的亲密盟友，他们控制着爱琴海和黑海 的贸易，他们的船只可以干扰奥斯曼帝国控制达达尼尔海峡两岸的努力。

At Constantinople’s height, somewhere between 500,000 and one million people had lived within its walls, but the bubonic plague and Ottoman sieges had reduced the number to perhaps fifty thousand. Nevertheless, so long as Constantinople stood on the western shore of the Bosporus controlling access to the Black Sea, the Ottomans could not rest easy in their domains.

君士坦丁 堡在鼎盛时期，大约有 50 万到 100 万人居住在城墙内， 但黑死病和奥斯曼帝国的围攻使这一数字减少到大约 5 万人。然而，只要君士坦丁堡仍然屹立在博斯 普鲁斯海峡西岸，控制着黑海的出海口，奥斯曼人就无法在自己的领土上高枕无忧。

On the morning of May 29, 1453, after a siege of fifty-seven days, the Ottoman guns breached the walls. The last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaeologus, died fighting for his city. The city fell to the Ottomans.

1453年5月29日早晨，经过五十七天的围困，奥斯曼大炮冲破城墙，括最后一位拜占庭皇帝君士坦丁十一世帕拉奥洛古斯，他为自己的城市 而战而死。这座城市落入了奥斯曼 帝国之手。

Mehmed regarded himself not as a usurper but as the rightful successor to the Byzantines. He declared himself Caesar, the heir to the old Roman imperial throne. He appointed a new leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Gennadius II, who in turn recognized Mehmed’s claim as the legitimate heir of the last Byzantine emperor. The last emperor’s actual heirs, his nephews, were taken into Mehmed’s service and occupied important administrative positions in the empire.

穆罕默德并不认为自己是篡位者，而是拜占庭人的合法继承人。他宣称自己是凯撒，是旧罗马帝国王 位的继承人。他任命了东正教的新领袖根纳迪乌斯二世，后者又承认穆罕默德是拜占庭末代皇帝的合 法继承人。最后一位皇帝的实际继承人，即他的侄子，被纳入穆罕默德的手下，并在帝国中担任重要 的行政职务。(这就是用前朝统治者的子孙, 来安抚前朝人心)

He ordered that the Byzantine cathedral of Hagia Sophia be left intact and converted into a mosque. He also ordered a new mosque, the Fatih Mosque (“Conqueror’s Mosque”), to be built in the city.

他下令将拜占庭式的圣索菲 亚大教堂完好无损地保留下来，改建为清真寺。他还下令在城内建造一座新清真寺，即法提赫清真寺（“征服者清真寺”）

As earlier Ottoman rulers had done, Mehmed allowed Christians and Jews in his lands to worship as they pleased. This arrangement was an early appearance of the Ottoman millet system, in which religious communities were allowed a substantial degree of autonomy and were governed by their own leaders and their own law codes.

正如早期的奥斯曼统治者 所做的那样，穆罕默德允许基督徒和犹太人在他的土地上按照自己的意愿进行礼拜。这种安排是奥斯 曼帝国米利特制度的早期出现，其中宗教团体被允许高度自治，并由自己的领导人和自己的法典管 辖。

He issued kanun, laws made by the sultan, as opposed to sharia (religious law) interpreted by Islamic judges, and compiled them in the Kanun-name (“Book of the Law”). Kanun dealt with issues that sharia often did not address, such as taxation or punishment for certain crimes.

他颁布了由苏丹制定的卡努(kanun)法律，与由伊斯兰法官解释的伊斯兰教法(sharia)相反，并以卡努(kanun)的名义编纂了这些法律。卡努处理了伊斯兰教法通常没有涉及的问题，比如税收或对某些罪行的惩罚。

the Ottomans gained control of part of the Silk Roads. The Ottomans commanded Red Sea ports in Egypt after defeating the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517, which gave them additional control over the spice trade. The Ottomans also dominated trade on the Black Sea. The exclusion of Italian merchants from their traditional trade routes, the heavy taxes imposed on goods that traveled overland, many Europeans’ dislike for transacting business with Muslims, and the expense of overland trade led western Europeans to seek all-water oceanic routes to South and East Asia.

奥斯曼人控制了部 分丝绸之路，并在 1517 年击 败马穆鲁克苏丹国后还控制了埃及的红海港口, 这使他们对香料贸易有了更多的控制权。。奥斯曼人还主导了黑海的贸易。意大利商 人被排除在传统贸易路线之外，对陆路货物征收重税，许多欧洲人不喜欢与穆斯林做生意，以及陆路 贸易的费用，导致西欧人寻求通往南半球和南半球的全水路海洋路线。东亚。

The fall of Constantinople was lamented in Europe as signaling that no significant force remained to counter the Muslim advance westward. For many historians, it also marks the end of the European Middle Ages. As the Byzantine Empire collapsed, many Greeks sought refuge in other lands. Many settled in Italy, especially in Venice and Rome.

君士坦丁堡的陷落在欧洲引起了人们的哀叹，因为这表明没有足够的力量来对抗穆斯林向西推进。对 于许多历史学家来说，这也标志着欧洲中世纪的结束。随着拜占庭帝国的崩溃，许多希腊人到其他国 家寻求庇护. 许多人定居在意大利，尤 其是威尼斯和罗马。

Byzantine scholars, theologians, artists, writers, and astronomers also fled westward to Europe, bringing with them the knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome that had been preserved in the eastern half of the Roman Empire after the western half fell. Among the texts they brought were the complete works of Plato and copies of Aristotle’s works in the original Greek. Access to these and other writings, many of which had been either unknown in western Europe or known only in the form of Arabic translations that arrived at the time of the Crusades, greatly influenced the course of the Italian Renaissance.

拜占庭的学者、神学家、艺术家、作家和天文学家也向西逃往欧洲，带来了西半部灭亡后罗马帝国东 半部保存下来的古希腊和古罗马的知识。他们带来的文本包括柏拉图全集和亚里士多德著作的希腊原 文抄本。这些著作和其他著作的获得极大地影响了意大利文艺复兴的进程，其中许多著作要么在西欧 不为人所知，要么仅以十字军东征时期到达的阿拉伯语译本的形式为人所知。

The Renaissance, which means “rebirth” in French. It began in the city-states of northern Italy that had grown wealthy through trade, especially trade with the Ottomans. Beginning in the 1300s, scholars there turned to the works of Western antiquity—the writings of the ancient Greeks and Romans—for wisdom and a model of how to live.

文艺复兴在法语中意为“重生”，它始于意大利北部的城邦，这些城邦通过贸易，特别是与奥斯曼帝国的贸易而变得 富裕。从 1300 年代开始，那里的学者转向西方古代著作——古希腊人和古罗马人的著作——寻求智慧 和生活方式的典范

During the Renaissance, the depiction of scenes from Greek and Roman mythology became common in European art.

文艺复兴时期，对希腊和罗马神话场景的描绘在欧洲艺术中变得很常见。

Petrarch has been called the father of humanism. Humanism was a movement born in Italy in the fourteenth century that focused on the study of human beings, human nature, and human achievements, as opposed to the study of God. Humanists stressed the beauty and dignity of humanity instead of focusing on its sinful, “fallen” nature.

彼特拉克被称为人文主义之父。人文主义是十四世纪诞生于意大利的一场运动，其重点是对人类、人 性和人类成就的研究，而不是对上帝的研究。人文主义者强调人性的美丽和尊严，而不是关注其罪恶 的“堕落”本质。

The first recorded use of gunpowder in battle occurred in China in 919. Western Europeans discovered recipes for gunpowder in Arabic texts brought back from the Crusades or, in the case of Spain, introduced by the Muslims who established kingdoms there from the eighth through the fifteenth centuries. By the fifteenth century, numerous European countries had begun to use gunpowder and guns in battle. By the thirteenth century, European and Ottoman armies were using early cannons called bombards to destroy the walls of cities and fortresses.

历史上第一次在战争中使用火药发生在 919 年的中国. 西欧人在十字军东 征带回的阿拉伯文献中发现了火药的配方，或者就西班牙而言，是由八世纪到十五世纪在那里建立王 国的穆斯林引入的。到了十五世纪，许多欧洲国家已经开始在战争中使用火药和枪支。到了十三世纪，欧洲和奥斯曼军队开始使用称为炮弹的早期大炮来摧毁城 市和堡垒的城墙。

It was the use of cannon that finally allowed the Ottomans to destroy the walls of Constantinople and bring an end to the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Earlier attempts to defeat the city had failed because armies could not break through the walls and were unable to carry on a prolonged siege that could reduce the Byzantines to starvation. The ability to destroy fortifications helped rulers assert power both in battle and at home. Nobles found it difficult to challenge the power of rulers whose cannon could destroy their castles.

正是大炮的使用，最终让奥斯曼人于1453年摧毁了君士坦丁堡的城墙，结束了 拜占庭帝国。早期攻克这座城市的尝试失败了，因为军队无法突破城墙，也无法进行长时 间的围困，从而使拜占庭人陷入饥饿。摧毁防御工事的能力帮助统治者在战争和国内维护权力。贵族 发现很难挑战统治者的权力，因为统治者的大炮可以摧毁他们的城堡。(君主能在军力上, 压制住了封臣贵族的军力)

The use of cannon also changed the nature of military defenses. Fortresses and city defenses were designed in the shape of stars so guns could be aimed in all directions, preventing an enemy from bringing artillery within reach of the walls. Engineers who knew how to build or destroy the new styles of fortress were in high demand. Paying for their expertise and for cannon, gunpowder, and cannon balls was expensive; rulers in societies that adopted guns taxed peasants heavily to pay for this new style of warfare.

大炮的使用也改变了军事防御的性质。要塞和城防被设计成星形(星堡)，这样火炮就可以瞄准各个方向，防止敌人将火炮射入城墙内。 知道如何建造或摧毁新型堡垒的工程师的需求量很大。为他们的专业知识以及大炮、火药和炮弹支付 的费用非常昂贵。采用枪支的社会中的统治者向农民征收重税，以支付这种新型战争的费用。

In most societies, male members of the nobility, often the only ones who could afford to purchase and pay for the upkeep of horses, had formed the core of the fighting forces. Their role as society’s defenders helped to justify the exalted position their class occupied. When handheld guns became common, armed peasant infantrymen supplanted the mounted elite. The loss of their warrior role often marked the beginning of the decline in the power of the aristocracy.

在大多数社会中，男性贵族成员通常是唯一有能力购买和支付马匹保养费用的人，他们构成了战斗力 量的核心。他们作为社会捍卫者的角色有助于证明他们的阶级所占据的崇高地位是合理的。当手持枪 支变得普遍时，武装农民步兵取代了骑兵精英。他们战士角色的丧失往往标志着贵族权力衰落的开 始

As societies adopted the use of guns, some states developed a decisive advantage over others. Rulers who had access to metal to forge guns and the chemicals to make gunpowder were better able to impose their will on societies that did not. Countries with centralized governments and well-developed bureaucracies that were able to effectively tax their populations had the money to pay for these developments and found it easier to locate and recruit soldiers into the army. States with these advantages grew even more powerful. Gunpowder thus helped to develop centralized states in Europe.

随着社会开始使用枪支，一些国家相对于其他国家形成了决定性优势。能够获得金属来锻造枪支和化 学物质来制造火药的统治者能够更好地将自己的意志强加于那些没有金属的社会。拥有中央集权政府和发达官僚机构、能够有效地向其人民征税的国家有钱来支付这些 发展，并且发现更容易找到和招募士兵加入军队。因此，火药有助于欧洲中央集权国家的发展

The adoption of guns by societies in Europe, Asia, and Africa was the beginning of the end for some nomadic cultures. For centuries before this, nomadic societies had often played an important role in world history and were often important agents in bringing about historical change.

欧洲、亚洲和非洲社会采用枪支是一些游牧文化终结的开始。在此之前的几个世纪里，游牧社会常常 在世界历史中发挥重要作用，并且常常是带来历史变革的重要推动者.

Beginning in the early modern era, nomadic societies increasingly began to settle down. The adoption of firearms by settled societies undoubtedly jeopardized the continued existence of nomadic societies.

从近代早期开始，游牧社会开始逐渐定居。定居社会采用火器无疑危及游牧社会的继续存在。

The European knights of the Middle Ages disappeared as a result of the widespread adoption of gunpowder and firearms.

中世纪的欧洲骑士 因火药和火器的广泛采用而消失。

Modern nation-states with permanent borders also objected to nomads crossing at will from one nation into another. They forced them to settle. Modern nation-states also found it easier to tax people who were not always on the move. As industrialization made settled life more comfortable, many nomads willingly abandoned their traditional way of life.

拥有永久边界的现代民族国家也反对游牧民族随意从一个国家进入另一个国家, 并强迫他们定居。对那些不经常流动的人征税更容易.随着 工业化使定居生活变得更加舒适，许多游牧民族自愿放弃他们的传统生活方式。
