==  The ancient Kingdom of Macedon

The ancient Kingdom of Macedon straddled today’s Greece and northern Macedonia. The Macedonians did not speak Greek but had adopted Greek culture in the Archaic period, and their royal family claimed to be descended from the mythical Greek hero Heracles.

古代马其顿王国横跨今天的希腊和马其顿北部。马其顿人不会说希腊语，但在古风时期就接受了希腊 文化，他们的王室自称是希腊神话英雄赫拉克勒斯的后裔。

When he died, Alexander had made no arrangements for a successor. Members of his court and his military commanders thus fought among themselves for control of the empire.

By the middle of the third century BCE, certain generals and their descendants were ruling as kings over different portions of Alexander’s empire (Figure 6.25). Antigonus and his descendants, the Antigonids, ruled Macedon and much of Greece. Some city-states in Greece organized federal leagues to maintain their independence from Macedon. Another Macedonian general, Ptolemy, was king of Egypt. Yet another Macedonian general, Seleucus and his descendants, the Seleucids, ruled as kings over much of the former Persian Empire.

亚历山大并没有为继任者做出安排。因此，他的宫 廷成员和军事指挥官为了争夺帝国的控制权而互相争斗. 到公元前三世纪中叶，某些将军及其后代作为国王统治着亚历山大帝国的不同部分（图6.25 ）。安提 柯和他的后裔安提柯王朝统治着马其顿和希腊的大部分地区。希腊的一些城邦组织了联邦联盟，以维 持独立于马其顿的地位。 另一位马其 顿将军托勒密是埃及国王。另一位马其顿将军塞琉古和他的后裔塞琉古王朝作为国王统治着前波斯帝国的大部分地 区.

A characteristic cultural feature of the Hellenistic period was the blending of Greek and other cultures of the former Persian Empire.

希腊化时期的一个文化特征是希腊文化与前波斯帝国其他文化的融合。

Alexandria in Egypt, founded by Alexander himself in 331 BCE, was the capital of the Ptolemaic kingdom and the largest Hellenistic city, with a population that reached one million.

埃及亚历山大城由亚历山大亲自于公元前331年建立，是托勒密王国的首都，也是最大的希腊化城市， 人口达100万。

Most Greek cities in this period were no longer independent since they were usually under the control of one of the Hellenistic kingdoms. The city-states of the Achaean and Aetolian Leagues in Greece were the exception, fiercely maintaining their independence against the Antigonid rulers of Macedon. Having lost the right of self-government, many Greeks in cities under the rule of kings no longer focused on politics and diplomacy but turned to the search for personal happiness. New religions emerged.

这一时期的大多数希腊城市不再独立，因为它们通常处于希腊化王国之一的控制之下。希腊的亚该亚 同盟和埃托利亚同盟的城邦是个例外，他们坚决反对马其顿的安提柯统治者，维持独立。由于失去了 自治权，许多国王统治下的城市中的希腊人不再关注政治和外交，而是转向寻求个人幸福。新的宗教 出现.

Another religion practiced in Hellenistic cities was Judaism.

希腊化城市中流行的另一种宗教是犹太教.

Some Greeks preferred new philosophies to religion as a means to achieve happiness. Hellenistic philosophy emphasized the search for internal peace and contentment. Stoicism, for example, maintained that the universe was governed by divine reason (Logos), which determined the fate of all people. Happiness therefore resulted from learning how to cope with life and accepting fate while avoiding extreme negative emotions such as fear and anger. Epicureans, however, maintained that the key to happiness was to avoid physical and mental pain by pursuing pleasure. The founders of these two philosophical schools, Zeno and Epicurus respectively, both lived in the early third century BCE and taught in Athens, which continued to be a center of learning in this period.

一些希腊人更喜欢新哲学而不是宗教作为实现幸福的手段。希腊化哲学强调寻求内心的平静与满足。例如，斯多葛主义认为宇宙是由神圣理性（逻各斯）统治的，它决定了所有人的命运。因此，幸福源 于学习如何应对生活、接受命运，同时避免恐惧、愤怒等极端负面情绪。然而，伊壁鸠鲁主义者认 为，幸福的关键是通过追求快乐来避免身体和精神上的痛苦。这两个哲学流派的创始人分别是芝诺和 伊壁鸠鲁，都生活在公元前三世纪初，并在雅典任教，雅典仍然是这一时期的学术中心。
