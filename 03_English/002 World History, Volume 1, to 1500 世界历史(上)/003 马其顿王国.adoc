When he died, Alexander had made no arrangements for a successor. Members of his court and his military commanders thus fought among themselves for control of the empire. By the middle of the third century BCE, certain generals and their descendants were ruling as kings over different portions of Alexander’s empire. Some city-states in Greece organized federal leagues to maintain their independence from Macedon.
