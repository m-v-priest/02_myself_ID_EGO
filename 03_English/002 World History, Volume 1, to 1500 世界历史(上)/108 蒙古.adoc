The first complete Song census showed around fifty-five million people in the early eleventh century. One hundred years later, there were around 120 million. At its height, Song China had at least three cities with populations of more than one million and dozens of cities with more than 100,000 people; in the same period in Europe, no city other than the Byzantine capital of Constantinople even approached these sizes after the fall of the western Roman Empire.

第 一次完整的宋代人口普查显示，十一世纪初约有五千五百万人口。一百年后，这一数字约为 1.2 亿。宋 代中国在鼎盛时期，人口超过百万的城市至少有3个，人口超过10万的城市有数十个；在同一时期的欧 洲，西罗马帝国灭亡后，除了拜占庭首都君士坦丁堡之外，没有任何城市能够达到这样的规模。

Taking advantage of the power vacuum caused by the collapse of the Tang dynasty, two steppe peoples extended their rule from the Inner Asian Steppe into northern China: the Khitan Liao, linguistically a Mongolian people who formed the Liao kingdom, and the Xia, sometimes called the Tangut, linguistically a Tibetan people who formed the Xi Xia kingdom.

利用唐朝崩溃造成的权力真空，两个草原民族将他们的统治从内亚草原延伸到中国北部：契丹辽（语言 上是蒙古民族，形成了辽国）和夏（有时称为辽国）。西夏人，在语言上是一个藏族民族，他们形成了 西夏王国。

The eight tribes of the Khitan Liao…​. Their leader abandoned the traditional elections in favor of a hereditary monarchy. A dual system of administration was adopted, using traditional tribal practices of governance in areas populated predominantly by steppe people, while a system of exams similar to that used by the mandarins selected officials in the majority-Chinese parts of the kingdom.

契丹辽八个部落, 918 年，他们的领导放弃了传统的选举，转而采用世袭君主制。采用了双重行政制度，在草原人 民占主导地位的地区采用传统的部落治理方式，而在王国的华人占多数的地区则采用与官僚相似的考试 制度来选拔官员。

In 1004, the Song and the Liao agreed to the Treaty of Shanyuan. In it, both the Song and the Liao emperors were referred to as Sons of Heaven. The two states were recognized as equals. Tellingly, however, on the issue of tribute, the Song were obligated to give the Liao an annual payment of 200,000 bolts of silk and 130,000 ounces of silver (worth about USD$2.7 million in 2020 prices). No reciprocal obligation of the Liao to give tribute to the Song was specified.

1004年，宋辽签订《山原条约》，宋朝和辽朝的皇帝都被称为天子。两国被认为是平等的. 然而，值得注意的是，在进贡问题上，宋朝有义务每年向辽国 缴纳20万匹丝绸和13万盎司白银（按2020年价格计算，价值约270万美元）。没有具体规定辽朝向宋朝 贡的相互义务。

The Song resented this relationship with the Liao, and in 1120 they bankrolled the revolt of one of Khitan Liao’s tributary states, the Jurchen. Once the Liao and the Jurchen were locked in combat, the Song attacked from the south. Exploiting divisions within the Liao kingdom, the Song and the Jurchen were victorious by 1125. The remnants of the Liao royal family fled west with supporters and founded the Kara-Khitan state. The Jurchen assumed rule of the former Liao lands as the Jin dynasty.

宋朝对与辽国的这种关系感到不满，并于1120年资助了契丹辽朝的一个朝贡国女真人的叛乱。当辽国与女真 国交战时，宋军从南方进攻。利用辽国内部的分裂，宋朝和女真人于1125年取得胜利。辽王室的残余势 力带着支持者西逃，建立了喀喇契丹国。女真人继承了金朝对前辽国的统治。

The Jin were not content to supplant the Liao. The Jin attacked the Song in 1126. Huizong quickly abdicated in favor of his eldest son, Qinzong. Qinzong dispatched a peace mission, led by his halfbrother Gaozong. The Jin took the mission hostage and extracted a hefty ransom and annual tribute to release its members and end the hostilities.

The peace proved short-lived as Qinzong tried to entice the former Liao mandarins, who were now working in service to the Jin, to revolt. They reported Qinzong’s clumsy intrigues to the Jin emperor, who launched a more protracted attack. Bent on conquest and revenge this time, the Jin refused to be bought, and in 1127 they took the Song capital and seized the entire imperial household, goods, and people, including Huizong and Qinzong. In what became known as the Jingkang incident, the Jin went on a three-week rampage of raping and looting throughout the city.

金人并不满足于取代辽人, 于 1126 年进攻宋朝。徽宗很快退位，让位给他的长子钦 宗. 钦宗派遣了由他同父异母的兄弟高宗率领的和平使团。金人将传教团扣为人质，并索取巨 额赎金和年度贡品，以释放其成员并结束敌对行动。

事实证明，和平是短暂的，因为钦宗试图引诱现在为金国效力的前辽朝官员起义。他们向金皇帝报告了 钦宗的拙劣阴谋，金皇帝发起了更持久的攻击。这次金人一心要征服和复仇，不肯收买，于1127年占领 了宋都，并夺取了整个皇室、货物和人民，包括徽宗和钦宗。在后来的靖康事件中，金人在全城进行了 长达三周的奸淫掠夺。

Gaozong, who proved much more politically adept than his father or his brother, had been sent south to lead reinforcements back to the capital. Upon learning of the capital’s fall, Gaozong united the military and mandarins behind him, proclaimed himself emperor, and rallied Song forces to halt the Jin advance. This event is considered the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty. War continued to rage until the 1140s, when the two sides agreed to the Treaty of Shaoxing, in which Gaozong ceded all Song territory north of the Huai River to the Jin, acknowledged the Song’s tributary status to the Jin, and agreed to pay an annual tribute of 250,000 bolts of silk and 325,000 ounces of silver (more than USD$6.7 million today).

事实证明，高宗在政治上比他的父亲或兄弟要熟练得多，他被派往南方，率领援军返回首都。高宗得知 首都失陷后，联合军队和官员，称帝，并集结宋军阻止金军前进。这一事件被认为是南宋王朝的开始。 战争持续激烈，直到1140年代，双方签订了《绍兴条约》 ，高宗将淮河以北的所有宋国领土割让给金 国，承认宋朝对金朝的朝贡地位，并同意每年缴纳贡金。贡品有 25 万匹丝绸和 32.5 万盎司白银（今天 价值超过 670 万美元）。

Within a dozen years of conquering the Liao Empire, the Jin began embracing the institutions and structures of the Song Confucian state. Landed aristocrats, generally descended from tribal chieftains, were replaced by mandarins selected by Confucian exams.

在征服辽帝国的十几年内，金人开始接受宋儒国家的制度和结构。土地贵族通常是部落酋长的后裔，被 儒家考试选拔的官员所取代.

By 1200, the Southern Song population was roughly the same size as it had been under the last census of the Song, despite encompassing much less land, and the economy seemed to have recovered to prewar levels.

到1200年， 南宋人口规模与宋朝上次人口普查时大致相同，尽管土地面积少得多，而且经济似乎已恢复到战前水 平。

While an increasing number of steppe people gathered in settled communities, many still lived as nomads. The clan, a small group of several families that shared an encampment and herded or hunted together, was the basic unit of steppe society. Each clan had a ruling lineage from which leaders were selected and that intermarried with other lineages to avoid in-breeding. Thus, the ruling lineages formed an aristocracy of sorts.

虽然越来越多的草原人聚集在定居社区，但许多人仍然过着游牧生活。氏族是由几个家庭组成的小团 体，共享一个营地，一起放牧或狩猎，是草原社会的基本单位。每个氏族都有一个统治血统，从中选出 领导者并与其他血统通婚以避免近亲繁殖。因此，统治世系形成了某种贵族制。

Given the high mortality among the steppe peoples, the adoption of children and widows was commonplace. Most households included some enslaved people. Children, wives, enslaved people, and livestock were often obtained by raiding weaker, underprepared clans.

由于草原人民的死亡率很高，收养儿童和寡妇是司空见惯的事. 大多数家庭都包括一些奴隶。儿童、妻子、奴隶和牲畜往往是通过袭击实力较 弱、准备不足的部落而获得的。

Clans joined together to form tribes under a single leader to better protect their herds and households, cooperate on resource management and migration, and engage in united actions like raids on other clans. Eurasian tribes were loosely organized, often multiethnic and multilingual, not exclusive to a kinship network, and open to any who were willing to obey the leader. Clans drifted in and out of tribes depending on their needs and wishes. Multiple tribes periodically united around a single skillful or charismatic leader, creating a larger confederation. This unity was very short-lived, rarely lasting beyond a generation or two.

氏族联合起来形成部落，由一个领导者领导，以更好地保护他们的畜群和家庭，在资源管理和迁徙方面 进行合作，并进行联合行动，例如袭击其他氏族。欧亚部落组织松散，通常是多种族和多语言的，并不 局限于亲属关系网络，并且向任何愿意服从领导者的人开放。氏族根据自己的需要和愿望进出部落。多 个部落定期联合在一位有能力或有魅力的领导者周围，形成一个更大的联盟。这种团结非常短暂，很少 能持续超过一两代人。

Many clans and dozens of tribes occupied the Mongolian grasslands in the late twelfth century. Settled peoples like the Jin and Song had long incited these nomadic groups against one another.

In 1161, concerned that a confederation led by Mongolian speakers was growing too powerful, the Jin encouraged and supported a confederation led by Tatars to attack the Mongol-led confederation. Tatar was a Turkish language.

(The fluidity of membership in clans, tribes, and confederations makes it problematic to consider a group led by a speaker of one language as truly having a common ethnic heritage or long-standing communal bond such as a modern nation has. Nevertheless, perhaps for the sake of simplicity, scholars tend to refer to confederations of seminomads by the primary language of their leader.)

12世纪后期，许多氏族和数十个部落占领了蒙古草原（图14.7 ）。金、宋等定居民族长期以来一直煽 动这些游牧民族互相争斗. 1161年，金朝担心蒙古语领导的联盟 变得过于强大，鼓励并支持鞑靼人领导的联盟进攻蒙古领导的联盟。鞑靼语是一种土耳其语.（氏族、部落和联盟成员的流动性使得认为由一种语言的使用者领 导的群体真正具有共同的种族遗产或像现代国家那样的长期社区纽带是有问题的。尽管如此，也许对于 为了简单起见，学者们倾向于用其领导人的主要语言来指称半游牧民族联盟。）

Mongol Tribes and the Three Steppe Kingdoms. This map shows (in yellow) the areas that various Mongol tribes considered their lands in the late twelfth century and where they were in relation to the three settled kingdoms of the Kara-Khitan, Xia, and Jin between the steppe and the Southern Song dynasty.

蒙古部落和三个草原王国。该地图（黄色）显示了 12 世纪末各个蒙古部落认为自己的土地的区域，以及它们与草原和南宋之间的 喀喇契丹、夏和金这三个定居王国的关系。

鞑靼人对蒙古联盟的攻击导致其部族分散.

There are no historical records of Temujin before he became known as Chinggis Khan. A work called The Secret History of the Mongols, likely written after his death, is the most potentially reliable source, though it is suspect because it is based solely on oral history interpreted by non-Mongols.

在铁木真成为成吉思汗之前，没有关于他的历史记录。一本名为《蒙 古秘史》的书可能是在他死后写成的，是最有可能可靠的来源，尽管它值得怀疑，因为它完全基于非蒙 古人解释的口述历史。

At some point in the early 1180s, Temujin broke with his friend and clan leader Jamukha and formed a new clan with himself as head.

1180 年代初的某个时候，铁木真与他的朋友兼部落首领札木合决裂，并组建了一个 以自己为首领的新部落。

As the clans allied with Temujin grew, Jamukha expanded his clan to keep up with him. Soon those in the Mongol-speaking part of the steppe were left with the choice of joining Temujin, joining Jamukha, or risking attack by one or the other.

随着与铁木真结盟的氏族不断壮大，札木合扩大了他的氏族以跟上他的步伐。很快，草原上 讲蒙古语的地区的人们就面临着两种选择：要么加入铁木真，要么加入札木合，要么冒着被其中一方攻 击的风险。

Chinggis Khan believed that without new sources of wealth and glory, people might grow restless and reject the peace he tried to create. His life experience had given him no concept of settled economic development or ways to redirect his people’s energy to that goal. Chinggis knew settled peoples were a source of wealth ripe for the Mongol Empire to take. In his eyes, conquering these peoples or intimidating them into giving tribute was the next logical step.

成吉思汗认为，如果没有新的财富和荣耀来源，人们可能会变得不安并拒 绝他试图创造的和平。他的生活经历没有给他带来稳定的经济发展的概念，也没有给他人民的精力转向 这个目标的方法。成吉思汗知 道定居的人民是蒙古帝国可以夺取的财富的来源。在他看来，征 服这些民族或恐吓他们进贡是下一个合乎逻辑的步骤。

The Kara-Khitan, assuming resistance would not go well, offered tribute to Chinggis Khan. After a coup in 1210, the new Xi Xia ruler accepted tributary status on terms similar to those of the Kara-Khitan.

喀喇契 丹人认为抵抗不会顺利，于是向成吉思汗进贡。 1210年政变后，新的西夏统治者接受了类似于喀喇契 丹的朝贡地位。

The Jin, however, were another matter. In 1210, a new Jin emperor demanded Chinggis Khan submit to him and send tribute, so Chinggis marched his smaller but superior army south to invade (Figure 14.9). A master at exploiting his opponents’ weaknesses, he realized that his linguistic cousins, the Khitan, resented the rule of the Jurchen Jin dynasty, so he portrayed his army as a liberating force for them. With their army swelling with Jin defectors, the Mongols were able to lay siege to Zhongdu, the Jin capital, and eventually seize the starving city. Chinggis Khan ordered the city thoroughly looted, tens of thousands enslaved, and untold numbers of others massacred.

然而金国却是另一回事。 1210年，金新皇帝要求成吉思汗臣服并进贡，于是成吉思汗率领规模较小但 实力雄厚的军队南下入侵。他是一位善于利用对手弱点的高手，他意识到他的语言近亲契丹 人对女真金王朝的统治感到不满，因此他将他的军队描绘成一支解放他们的力量。随着金朝叛逃者的增 多，蒙古人得以围攻金都中都，并最终占领了这座饥饿的城市。成吉思汗下令对这座城市进行彻底洗 劫，数万人被奴役，无数人被屠杀。

The Mongol Empire. This map shows the areas conquered by the Mongol Empire under Chinggis Khan’s leadership from 1207 to 1227. The black arrows depict the paths his army took, including exploratory campaigns outside the empire’s boundaries to the west. In areas of northern China, Chinggis Khan had to invade areas he had already conquered that rebelled.

蒙古帝国。该地图显示了 1207 年至 1227 年间成吉思汗领导下的蒙古帝国所征服的地区。黑色箭头描绘了他的军队所走的路线， 包括向西帝国边界以外的探索活动。在中国北方地区，成吉思汗不得不入侵他已经征服的叛乱地区。

image:/img/0026.jpg[,100%]

Once the spoils from Zhongdu had been gathered, Chinggis Khan and his army headed back to the steppe, leaving the campaign against the Jin mostly in the hands of his Khitan allies. Forces loyal to Chinggis Khan continued to subdue the Yellow River basin and expanded north into the Jurchen homeland, even venturing to the Korean Peninsula. By 1223, these areas were pacified and providing tribute to the Mongol Empire and its allies who occupied them.

中都的战利品收集完毕后，成吉思汗和他的军队返回草原，将对抗金人的战役主要交给了他的契丹盟 友。忠于成吉思汗的军队继续征服黄河流域，并向北扩张到女真故土，甚至冒险进入朝鲜半岛。到 1223 年，这些地区得到平定，并向占领这些地区的蒙古帝国及其盟友进贡。

The absorption of the Kara-Khitan into the Mongol Empire had provided a direct border with the Islamic world through Khwarazmia, a realm stretching from Persia through central Asia. Around 1218, Chinggis Khan sent a caravan to the leader of Khwarazmia, Allah al- Din Muhammad, with a letter requesting the establishment of trade relations.

喀喇契丹并入蒙古帝国，通过花 剌子模（一个从波斯延伸到中亚的领土）与伊斯兰世界建立了直接边界。 1218 年左右，成吉思汗派遣 了一支商队去见花剌子模领袖安拉丁·穆罕默德，并附上一封信，请求建立贸 易关系.

In a grave miscalculation, Allah al-Din Muhammad killed most of the emissaries Chinggis Khan sent to demand compensation, which meant war for Chinggis Khan. This included the decimation of the cities of Herat, Merv, and Nishapur, which for centuries had been three of the most important and prominent cities of the eastern Islamic world.

由于严重误判， 安拉丁·穆罕默德杀死了成吉思汗派去要求赔偿的大部分使者. 这 对成吉思汗意味着战争, 其中 包括对赫拉特、梅尔夫和尼沙布尔等城市的摧毁，这些城市几个世纪以来一直是东部伊斯兰世界最重要 和最著名的三个城市。

The Xi Xia refused to send troops to aid the war against the Khwarazmians, an act Chinggis saw as a betrayal. After defeating the Khwarazmians, he invaded the Xi Xia lands to punish them for this disloyalty. However, he died several months before the completion of his conquest.

西夏拒绝派兵援助对抗花剌子模的战争，成吉思汗认为这是一种背叛。在击败花剌子模人 后，他入侵西夏土地以惩罚他们的不忠。然而，他在 完成征服前几个月就去世了.

To intimidate the tributary states, Ogedei attacked and defeated the Jin by 1234.

为了恐吓朝贡国，窝阔台于1234年进攻并击败金国。

More than pursuing a life of conquest, Ogedei wanted to siphon off wealth as tribute through control of Eurasia’s trade routes. 1235, Ogedei called a kurultai to decide which lands should be conquered to provide it. After much debate, it was decided to attack both Europe and Song China.

窝阔台 不仅追求征服的生活，还想通过控制欧亚大陆的贸易路线来攫取财富作为贡品。1235年，窝阔台召集了库鲁台来决定应该征服哪些土地来提供它。经过多 次争论，决定同时进攻欧洲和宋朝中国。

Ogedei had given no thought to succession, however, and almost a decade of infighting occurred after his death. It took until 1251 for majority support to coalesce around Chinggis Khan’s grandson Mongke. His brother Kublai Khan was sent to Song China.

然而，窝阔台并没有考虑过继承问题，他死后又发生了近十年的内讧. 直到 1251 年，大多数人才支持成吉思汗的孙子蒙哥。 他一个兄弟忽必烈则 被派往(占领)宋朝中国。

解释:
"His brother Kublai Khan was sent to Song China." 里面没有逗号，句子就是暗示说他有多个兄弟，而其中一个是 Kublai Khan。
如果改成 "His brother, Kublai Khan, was sent to Song China." ，中间的两个逗号是为了提供一个附加信息（appositive），即“他的兄弟”是谁——Kublai Khan。这种结构是非限制性的附加信息，表示 Kublai Khan 是唯一被提及的兄弟，读者已经知道“他的兄弟”是谁。

The Four Khanates of the Mongol Empire. This map shows the areas ruled by the four Mongol khanates after the death of Kublai Khan in 1294. For all intents and purposes, these were separate sovereign states.

蒙古帝国的四个汗国。该地图显示了 1294 年忽必烈汗去世后四个蒙古汗国统治的地区。无论从何种角度和目的来看，这些汗国 都是独立的主权国家。

The rulers of three of the four khanates eventually converted to Islam along with many of their people.

四个汗国中的三个汗国的统治者最终和他们的许多人民一起皈依了伊斯兰教

The areas west of the Volga River, populated largely by Orthodox Christians, were the only ones that did not see the majority convert to Islam, and they remain so to this day.

伏尔加河以 西的地区主要是东正教基督徒，是唯一没有看到大多数人皈依伊斯兰教的地区，直到今天仍然如此。

Although Kublai attempted to subdue the Song while fighting Ariq Boke, he did not begin serious efforts to conquer them until 1265. It took over a dozen years, but by 1279, the Song military was broken and its royal family dead or in hiding.

尽管忽必烈试图在与阿里不哥作战的同时征服宋朝，但直到1265年他才开始认真地征服他们。这花了 十几年的时间，但到了1279年，宋军被击溃，其皇室成员死亡或躲藏。

In the year 1279, many Song loyalists, approximately 250,000 people in over a thousand oceancapable boats, anchored off a remote bay near modern Yamen, China. There they prepared for a last stand. Within a few days, the Songs’ supply of fresh water ran out. Morale among the Song collapsed, and most of them committed suicide by jumping into the sea.

1279 年，大约 25 万人乘坐超过 1000 艘可远洋航行的船只，在现代中国衙门附近的一个偏远海湾停 泊, 进行最后的抵抗. 几天之内，宋家的淡 水就用完了。宋 人士气崩溃，大多数人跳海自杀。

Kublai Khan’s most drastic change was to replace the Confucian system of class distinctions based on economic function with one based on ethnicity. At the top of the Yuan class structure were Mongols, followed by non-Chinese people, who were Europeans or previous steppe inhabitants like the Jurchen, Tangut, and Khitan. The bottom two classes were Chinese people: those of Han ethnicity who had been ruled by the Jin in the north, and the remaining Song Chinese who lived in the south. Mongols could not marry people from these bottom two classes.

忽 必烈最彻底的改变是用基于种族的阶级制度取代了儒家基于经济功能的阶级制度。元代阶级结构的顶 端是蒙古人，其次是非汉族人，他们是欧洲人或以前的草原居民，如女真人、西夏人和契丹人。最底 层的两个阶级是中国人：北方曾受金人统治的汉族，以及居住在南方的宋人。蒙古人不能与这两个底 层的人结婚。

Adopting the Khitan idea of ruling different types of people differently, the Yuan dynasty had separate types of administration for its varied peoples. The Song Chinese, who were at the bottom of the four-class system, were governed by two administrators, one a Chinese person and one a Mongol or non-Chinese person. Both were imperial appointees. The Chinese administrator was under the supervision of and responsible to his counterpart. People in all these positions were rotated periodically, so they could not build up a power base. 元朝沿袭契丹人的异治思想

元朝沿袭契丹人的异治思想，对不同的民族实行不同的行政管理方式。宋人处于四阶级制 度的底层，由两名行政人员统治，一名是汉人，一名是蒙古人或非汉人。两人都是皇帝任命的。中方 管理人员受对方管理人员的监督并对管理人员负责。所有这些职位的人员都是周期性轮换的，因此无 法建立权力基础。

Some non-Chinese administrators over the Song had not intended to work in the Yuan government. They came seeking some favor, often the right to trade, in exchange for which the emperors required them to perform administrative tasks. Among these bureaucrats taken as hostages, most were Muslim traders from other parts of the Mongol Empire. Regardless of how well they did their jobs, such bureaucrats were not likely to bond with the population and create a power base from which to challenge imperial authority.

宋朝的一些非华人管理者并不打算在元朝政府工作。他们前来寻求一些好处，通常是贸易权，作为交 换，皇帝要求他们执行行政任务。他们中大多数都是来自蒙古帝国其他地区的穆斯林商人。不管他们的工作做得有多 好，这些官僚不太可能与民众建立联系并建立挑战帝国权威的权力基础。

Following Kublai’s death in 1294, his system’s flaws became apparent. In 1315, his great-grandson Buyantu reinstated the mandarin exam system. Non-Chinese people took different (and shorter) exams than the Chinese people, and between 25 and 50 percent of those who passed had to be non-Chinese people. The effect of this quota was magnified because Song Chinese people made up more than 90 percent of the population, according to Yuan censuses. Between the differences in the exams and the quota system, it was much easier for Mongols and non-Chinese to pass than for Chinese.

1294 年忽必烈去世后，他的制度的缺陷就变得明显了。 1315年，他的曾孙布彦图恢复了官考试制. 非华人参加的考试与华人不同（且时间更短），通过考试的人中有 25% 至 50% 必须是非华人。根据元朝人口普查，宋人占人口的90%以上，这一配额的效果被放大 了。由于考试和配额制度的差异，蒙古人和非汉人比中国人更容易通过。

Yuan China’s economic growth had at best stagnated, thanks to a decline in consumer purchasing power caused by inflation and heavy taxation. The use of paper currency was a major contributor to inflation. While paper money was theoretically convertible to metal or silk, the Yuan government issued much more of it than it had metal or silk to redeem it with. Kublai decreed that currency must be used in transactions with the government. This meant the population could not escape increasing inflation, however, as successive Yuan governments issued more paper currency to pay their bills and forced the population to obtain such money to pay their taxes.

元朝中国由于通货膨胀和重税导致消费者购买力下降，经济增长充其量也停滞了。纸 币的使用是通货膨胀的一个主要因素。虽然纸币理论上可以兑换成金属或丝绸，但元朝政府发行的纸 币远多于可兑换的金属或丝绸。忽必烈颁布法令，货币必须用于与政府的交易，这意味着人民无法逃避日益严重的通货膨胀，因为历届元朝政府发 行了更多的纸币来支付账，并迫使人民获得这些钱来缴纳税款.

The Yuan spent lavishly on grandiose but failed military ventures that bankrupted the government.

元朝在宏伟但失败的军事冒险上投入了大量资金，导致政府破产。

Politically, thirteenth-century Europe was a series of confederations of warriors who had sworn oaths of vassalage, or loyalty, to one of the titular European kings. There were no real centralized governments, courts, or bureaucracies. The real power of kings rested on the willingness of their vassals to provide them with the support they had pledged. Most people saw their parish priest much more often than their feudal lord.

从政治上讲，十三世纪的欧洲是由一系列战士组成的联盟，他们宣誓效忠欧洲一位名义上的国王。不 存在真正的中央集权政府、法院或官僚机构。国王的真正权力取决于封臣是否愿意向他们提供他们所承诺的支持. 大多数人见到教区牧师的次数比见到封建领主的次数要多 得多。

In the 1230s, Pope Gregory IX created an Office of Papal Inquisition to centralize the persecution of heresy throughout Western Christendom. Thus began the Inquisition.

1230 年代，教皇格列高利九世设立了教皇宗教裁判所，集中迫害整个西方基督教世界的异端邪说。宗 教裁判所就这样开始了.

The monarchy established secular political control through the 1231 Constitutions of Melfi, considered the oldest surviving written constitution in the world. The Constitutions of Melfi increased the power of the monarch by replacing vassals and church officials with royal bureaucrats as local administrators and judges. The bureaucracy was funded by revenue from royal monopolies on essential products like salt, iron, and copper, along with tariffs and tolls. The state created by the Constitutions of Melfi resisted church encroachment on its authority better than the Holy Roman Empire had.

君主政体通过 1231部梅尔菲宪法（被认为是世界上现存最古老 的成文宪法）建立了世俗政治控制。梅尔菲宪法通过用皇家官僚取代封臣和教会官员担任地方行政长 官和法官，增强了君主的权力。官僚机构的资金来自皇家对盐、铁和铜等基本产品的垄断收入，以及 关税和通行费。梅尔菲宪法创建的国家比神圣罗马帝国更好地抵制了教会对其权威的侵犯。

A stronger central government also emerged in France over the thirteenth century. Royal bureaucrats replaced vassals and church officials, and the monarchy had sufficient income to pay for their loyalty. Beginning with King Phillip II in the late twelfth century, French monarchs exploited opportunities to add to their royal holdings by taking land from their nobles. These new lands were managed by salaried royal appointees, not vassals who could pass their holdings to heirs. By the early fourteenth century, much of France was under direct royal control, greatly enhancing the resources French kings could call upon in conflicts with their vassals and the church.

十三世纪法国也出现了更强大的中央政府。皇家官僚取 代了封臣和教会官员，君主政体有足够的收入来支付他们的忠诚。从十二世纪末的菲利普二世国王开 始，法国君主利用机会从贵族手中夺取土地来增加自己的王室财产。这些新土地由受薪的皇家任命者 管理，而不是由可以将其财产传给继承人的封臣管理。到了十四世纪初，法国的大部分地区都处于王 室的直接控制之下，这极大地增强了法国国王在与其封臣和教会发生冲突时可以动用的资源。

England developed differently than other European states. The monarch’s power over its vassals and the church was limited from the thirteenth century onward, and the basic rights of commoners were protected. King John’s vassals compelled him in 1215 to reaffirm those rights and expand them in Magna Carta, a document that reiterated existing rights and relationships of vassals. The document confirmed the papal position that the church was above the state and “shall have its rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired . . . by our heirs in perpetuity.” Among the rights spelled out in Magna Carta, perhaps the most important was that “no free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals.” This requirement created a precedent for trial by jury, which remains a staple of the judicial system in the West to the present day.

英国的发展与其他欧洲国家不同。从十三世纪开始，君主对其封臣和教会的权力受到限制，平民的基 本权利受到保护。约翰的封臣迫使他于 1215 年在《大宪章》中重申了这些权利 并扩大了这些权利，该文件重申了封臣的现有权利和关系。该文件确认了教皇的立场，即教会凌驾于 国家之上，“其权利不应受到削弱，其自由不应受到损害……”。 。 。由我们的继承人永久继承。”在 《大宪章》规定的权利中，也许最重要的是“任何自由人不得被扣押或监禁，或被剥夺其权利或财产， 或被取缔或流放，或以任何方式被剥夺其地位，我们也不得对他使用武力，或派遣其他人这样做，除 非得到与他同等的人的合法判断。”这一要求开创了陪审团审判的先例，至今仍是西方司法制度的主要 内容。

The other key development leading toward centralized government with limited and specified powers was the creation of a deliberative body of nobles, clergy, and commoners that replaced the Great Council of the king’s vassals and high clergy. This new body evolved into Parliament, designed to represent the interests of the people. Membership was expanded to representatives elected by the vassals of the king’s vassals, and starting in 1265, selected towns could send representatives to speak for the interests of merchants.

导致权力有限和明确的中央集权政府的另一个关键发展是建立了一个由贵族、神职人员和平民组成的 审议机构，取代了国王封臣和高级神职人员组成的大议会。这个新机构演变为议会，旨在代表人民的 利益。成员资格扩大到由国王的封臣选出的代表，从1265年开始，选定的城镇可以派出代表为商人的 利益代言。

Parliament had two primary powers. One was to approve all tax increases. To establish uniform rule by the monarch, as opposed to a decentralized set of laws from the nobility and a potentially conflicting set from the church, Edward I asked Parliament to also approve laws. Parliamentary approval made the laws England’s laws, not just the king’s laws. Even if the king had drafted them, the nobles, clergy, and wealthy commoners had to agree to them.

议会有两项主要权力。一是批准所有增税。为了建立君主的统一统治，而不是贵族制定分散的法律和 教会制定可能相互冲突的法律，爱德华一世要求议会也批准法律。议会的批准使这些法律成为英格兰 的法律，而不仅仅是国王的法律。即使是国王起草的，贵族、神职人员和富有的平民也必须同意。

The Yuan dynasty…​ Although some Chinese officials maintained their positions at the local level, the most lucrative and prestigious jobs were held primarily by Mongols and non-Chinese outsiders. Mongol leaders supported the ethnic and religious diversity of Yuan China. By developing policies favorable to trade, and expanding the circulation of paper money, Mongol leadership fostered economic expansion and a cosmopolitan spirit that attracted many foreign traders to China.

元朝的政府人员主 要是外国人，而不是中国臣民。尽管一些中国官员保留了地方一级的职位，但最赚钱、最有声望的职 位主要由蒙古人和非华裔外来者担任。蒙古领导人支持元朝中国的民族和宗教多样性. 通过制定有利于贸易的政 策以及扩大纸币流通，蒙古领导层促进了经济扩张和国际化精神，吸引了许多外国商人来 到中国。

In 1368, the Yuan dynasty officially came to an end. 1368年，元朝正式灭亡。

Mongols living in the Il-Khanate had already begun intermarrying with their Muslim subjects. As they gradually became less culturally distinct from them, the Mongols increasingly became part of the sedentary societies they conquered and eventually abandoned their role as military conquerors.

居住在伊尔汗国的蒙古人已经开始与他们的穆斯林臣民通婚，但随着他们在文化上与穆斯林 臣民的差异逐渐缩小, 蒙古人现在 越来越多地成为他们所征服的定居社会的一部分，并最终放弃了军事征服者的角色。(蒙古人和当地人混血后, 在文化上和人种上就逐渐被穆斯林同化了)
