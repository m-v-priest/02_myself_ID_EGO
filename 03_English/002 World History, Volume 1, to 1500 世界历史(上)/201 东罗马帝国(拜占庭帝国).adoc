== 东罗马帝国 (395—1453年) 发展与灭亡框架

=== 建立

Constantine had effectively ushered in a new era of Christian governance. Rulers for the rest of the empire’s history were explicitly Christian, acting as de facto heads of the church and controlling church policy.

君士坦丁实 际上开创了基督教统治的新时代。帝国其他历史时期的统治者都是明确的基督教徒，他们充当事实上 的教会领袖并控制教会政策。

But while the emperors self-styled themselves as priestly rulers, the bishops sometimes contested this role, and emperors then had to compete with them for religious authority.

但是，虽然皇帝自称为祭司统治者，但主教有时会质疑这一角 色，皇帝就不得不与他们争夺宗教权威。


Historians have carved out roughly 150 to 750 CE as the period of Late Antiquity and view it as a time of vibrant transformation in the Mediterranean, rather than simply Rome’s decline and fall. People from this period thought of themselves as being different from what was seen in the ancient world.

历史学家将大约公元 150 年至 750 年划定为古代晚期时期，并将其视为地中海充满活力的变革时期， 而不仅仅是罗马的衰落和衰落。这一时期的人们在某些方面认为自己与古代世界不同。


The period of Late Antiquity witnessed the height of two great competing empires. The Roman Empire morphed into the Byzantine Empire. Meanwhile, in the East, the Sasanian Empire emerged and vied with the Byzantines for supremacy.

古代晚期见证了两个伟大的相互竞争的帝国的鼎盛时期。罗马帝国演变成拜占庭帝国. 在东方，萨珊王朝崛起 (存在于224-651年)，并与拜占庭帝国争夺霸权。


…, leading this period to be known as the “Byzantine Dark Age” because of the severe lack of historical writing that survived in the seventh and eight centuries.

由于七、八世纪的历史著 作严重缺乏, 导致这一时期被称为“拜占庭黑暗时代”.

=== 被 (突厥)奥斯曼土耳其帝国 灭亡


1453 年拜占庭帝国的衰落导致许多希腊学者和神学家 逃往意大利城邦.

The fall of Constantinople was lamented in Europe as signaling that no significant force remained to counter the Muslim advance westward. For many historians, it also marks the end of the European Middle Ages. As the Byzantine Empire collapsed, many Greeks sought refuge in other lands. Many settled in Italy, especially in Venice and Rome.

君士坦丁堡的陷落在欧洲引起了人们的哀叹，因为这表明没有足够的力量来对抗穆斯林向西推进。对 于许多历史学家来说，这也标志着欧洲中世纪的结束。随着拜占庭帝国的崩溃，许多希腊人到其他国 家寻求庇护. 许多人定居在意大利，尤 其是威尼斯和罗马。

Byzantine scholars, theologians, artists, writers, and astronomers also fled westward to Europe, bringing with them the knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome that had been preserved in the eastern half of the Roman Empire after the western half fell. Among the texts they brought were the complete works of Plato and copies of Aristotle’s works in the original Greek. Access to these and other writings, many of which had been either unknown in western Europe or known only in the form of Arabic translations that arrived at the time of the Crusades, greatly influenced the course of the Italian Renaissance.

拜占庭的学者、神学家、艺术家、作家和天文学家也向西逃往欧洲，带来了西半部灭亡后罗马帝国东 半部保存下来的古希腊和古罗马的知识。他们带来的文本包括柏拉图全集和亚里士多德著作的希腊原 文抄本。这些著作和其他著作的获得极大地影响了意大利文艺复兴的进程，其中许多著作要么在西欧 不为人所知，要么仅以十字军东征时期到达的阿拉伯语译本的形式为人所知。
