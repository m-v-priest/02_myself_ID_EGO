==  Islam

The modern monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have a great deal in common
with one another, including a number of traditions and beliefs. At the center of these shared
traditions is the worship of one god, but the leadership of the prophets—individuals who were
chosen to receive messages to humankind from God—is shared, too. Perhaps no prophetic figure is
quite as central in all three faiths as the prophet Abraham. Abraham was a patriarch of
the Israelites in Jewish and Christian tradition. In one of the bestknown
stories from the scripture featuring him, he was willing to sacrifice his own son if necessary in
order to obey his God. Islamic tradition holds that he is also the ancestor of all the Arabs, and the
house of worship he constructed in Mecca, in western Arabia, has become a revered site of
pilgrimage for Muslims around the world.


犹太教、基督教和伊斯兰教等现代一神论宗教彼此有很多共同点. 这些共同传
统的核心是对一位神的崇拜，但先知（被选中从上帝那里向人类传达信息的个人）的领导权也是共同
的。也许没有哪个先知人物像先知亚伯拉罕那样在所有三种信仰中占据中心地位。亚伯拉
罕是犹太教和基督教传统中以色列人的族长，他们是共同的祖先. 在圣经中最著名的关于他的故事之一中，如果有必要，他愿意牺牲自己的儿子来
服从他的上帝。伊斯兰教传统认为，他也是所有阿拉伯人的祖先，他在阿拉伯西部麦加建造的礼拜
堂，已成为世界各地穆斯林崇敬的朝圣地。

The story of Abraham, called Ibrahim, within Islam is an important one. According to Islamic tradition, he was the first person to settle in what later became the city of
Mecca. There
he constructed the Kaaba, considered by Muslims to be the house of God and the most sacred site
in Islam.

亚伯拉罕（又名易卜拉欣）的故事在伊斯兰教中是一个重要的故事。根据伊斯兰传统，他是第一个在后来成为麦加城的地方定居
的人。他在那里建造了天房，穆斯
林认为这是上帝的殿堂，也是伊斯兰教最神圣的地方。

Muslims believe that as generations passed, however, the descendants of Ishmael, the Arabs, forgot
their monotheism and began to worship idols, entering a period of ignorance known as the jahiliyyah.
There they remained until God sent a new prophet, Muhammad, to correct their religious practices
and deliver them from ignorance and disbelief. This lapse and deliverance, according to the faithful,
is the story of Islam.

然而，穆斯林相信，随着世代的流逝，以实玛利的后裔阿拉伯人忘记了他们的一神教并开始崇拜偶
像，进入了被称为“贾希利耶”的无知时期。他们一直留在那里，直到真主派遣一位新的先知穆罕默德来
纠正他们的宗教习俗，并将他们从无知和怀疑中解救出来. 根据信徒的说法，这种失误和拯救就是伊
斯兰教的故事。(本质就是一个"迷失自我, 找回初心"的故事)


Seen from the outside, the Arabian Peninsula of the fifth and sixth centuries CE was a seemingly
marginal space, on the southern fringes of the last great realms of antiquity, the Byzantine (Roman)
and Sasanian (Persian) Empires.

从外部看，公元五世纪和六世纪的阿拉伯半岛似乎是一个边缘地带，位于古代最后一个伟大王国拜占
庭（罗马）和萨珊王朝（波斯）帝国的南部边缘。

七世纪之前阿拉伯半岛的人
民几乎没有统一过。

In the very north of Arabia, along the southern borders of the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires, ... those of northern Arabia were most regularly engaged in harassing the trade caravans
that brought goods to and from the urban imperial centers. To combat this aggression on their
southern borders, both the Byzantines and the Persians opted to employ certain Arab confederations
to create a buffer between the settled peoples and the raiders from the south.

在阿拉伯半岛的最北端，沿着拜占庭帝国和萨珊帝国的南部边界，阿拉伯北部
的部落最经常骚扰往返于城市帝国中心的贸易商队。为了对抗对南部边境的侵略，拜占庭人和波斯人
都选择利用某些阿拉伯联盟在定居人民和来自南方的入侵者之间建立缓冲区。



..., leading this period to be known as the “Byzantine Dark Age” because of the severe lack of
historical writing that survived in the seventh and eight centuries. +

Yet at the same time, the Arabs of western Arabia were being
united for the first time in history, through the leadership of a man named Muhammad and the
religion of Islam, with direct repercussions for the survival of the two ancient empires.



由于七、八世纪的历史著
作严重缺乏, 导致这一时期被称为“拜占庭黑暗时代”.  +

然而与此同时，阿拉伯西部的阿拉伯人在穆罕默德和伊斯兰教的领导下历史上第一次
联合起来，这对两个古老帝国的生存产生了直接影响。

Islam, a word meaning “submission [to the one God].” Islam is a monotheistic faith.

伊斯兰教，这个词的
意思是“服从[独一的真主]”。伊斯兰教是一种一神论信仰


And because many people
were illiterate at this time and not writing their history as it happened, we have less evidence outside
religious scripture to help us reconstruct it. the Arabs transmitted this information primarily through a
process of memorization and oral recitation.

由于当时许多人都是
文盲，也没有按照当时的情况书写他们的历史，因此我们在宗教经文之外没有多少证据可以帮助我们
重建历史。阿拉伯人主要通过记忆和口头背诵的
过程来传递这些信息.


At the center of the founding of Islam are the city of Mecca, the worship of one God—Allah—and the
leadership of the prophets. Even to Muslims today, Allah is not considered to be a god separate from
the God of Judaism and Christianity; Allah is simply the Arabic word meaning “the one God.” In fact,
Christians who live in the Middle East and speak Arabic today refer to the God of the Christian Bible
by using the word “Allah” in their own worship. Belief in the one God and the message of the Islamic
prophet Muhammad is the first and most important of the “Five Pillars of Islam,” known as the
shahada, the profession of faith. To embrace Islam as their religion, adherents must recognize the
creed that “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.” Muhammad, as
recognized by Muslims, was the final prophet in a long list with whom the one God had
communicated throughout history, including figures such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and
Jesus. Muhammad was a divinely chosen man who is not, nor ever has been, worshipped as a God
or as a relative of God himself.

伊斯兰教建立的中心是麦加城、对独一真主安拉的崇拜以及先知的领导。即使对于今天的穆斯林来
说，安拉也不被认为是与犹太教和基督教的上帝分开的神。安拉（Allah）是阿拉伯语，意思是“独一的
神”。事实上，今天生活在中东并讲阿拉伯语的基督徒在他们自己的崇拜中使用“安拉”一词来指代基督
教圣经中的上帝。对独一真主和伊斯兰先知穆罕默德信息的信仰是“伊斯兰教五大支柱”中第一个也是最
重要的，被称为清真言（shahada） ，即信仰的表白。要接受伊斯兰教作为他们的宗教，信徒必须承认
“万物非主，唯有真主，穆罕默德是真主的使者”的信条。穆斯林所承认的穆罕默德是真主在整个历史中
与他沟通过的一长串先知名单中的最后一位先知，其中包括亚当、诺亚、亚伯拉罕、摩西和耶稣等人
物。穆罕默德是神选的人，他没有、也从来没有被当作神或神的亲戚来崇拜。



... ritual fasting, charity, and daily prayer. For Muslims, these acts are specified as daily prayer while
facing the direction of the holy mosque in the city of Mecca; almsgiving, the donation of money and
goods to the community and people in need; fasting (if able) during Ramadan, the holy month during
which the Muslim scripture of the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad; and participating at least
once (if able) in the pilgrimage to Mecca—the hajj—to relive important moments in the life of
Abraham and his family’s arrival in Arabia and to circle the house of God, the Kaaba, in prayer.

...仪式性禁食、慈善和每日祈祷。对于穆
斯林来说，这些行为被指定为每天面向麦加城神圣清真寺的方向进行的祈祷；施舍，向社区和有需要
的人捐赠金钱和物品；在斋月期间禁食（如果可以的话），斋月是穆斯林《古兰经》首次向穆罕默德
启示的圣月；至少参加一次（如果可以的话）麦加朝圣——朝觐——重温亚伯拉罕及其家人抵达阿拉
伯生活中的重要时刻，并绕着上帝的殿堂天房祈祷。


One of the core tenets or “Five Pillars” of Islam is participation in the pilgrimage to the holy
city of Mecca. This event, when undertaken during the month of Dhu al-Hijja, is known as
the hajj. Each year millions of Muslims travel to the holy city to take part in a process that
has been going on for almost fourteen hundred years.

伊斯兰教的核心信条或“五大支柱”之一是参加圣城麦加朝圣。这项活动在 Dhu al-Hijja 月举
行，被称为朝觐。每年都有数以百万计的穆斯林前往圣城参加一个已经持续了近一千四百年
的过程。

While Mecca was the home of the prophet Muhammad, for Muslims the pilgrimage is about
much more. The rituals and events in which they participate are intended to reenact
important events in the life of a different prophet, Abraham.

...the Kaaba, the
black-shrouded cube structure at the center that is believed to be the original home of
monotheism. Some Muslims believe the Kaaba was constructed by Adam,
the first man, and then reconstructed by Abraham.

虽然麦加是先知穆罕默德的故乡，但对于穆斯林来说，朝圣的意义远不止于此。他们参加的
仪式和活动旨在重现另一位先知亚伯拉罕生活中的重要事件。
天房的中心是黑色笼罩的立方体
结构，被认为是一神教的发源地。一些穆斯林认为天房是由第一个人亚当建造
的，然后由亚伯拉罕重建。

In addition to Adam, Abraham, and
Muhammad, other great figures of history have been adopted and associated with worship
at the Kaaba, including Iskandar, more recognizably known as Alexander the Great.

除了亚当、亚伯拉罕和穆罕默德之外，其他伟大的历史
人物也被采用并与天房的崇拜联系在一起，其中包括伊斯坎达尔，更广为人知的名字是亚历
山大大帝。

Islamic law recognizes that the hajj is not a trip every Muslim will be able to take. Some
may not be healthy enough, and Islamic charitable organizations around the world collect
donations to support those who cannot otherwise afford it. Pilgrims may also travel to the
holy mosque during other times of the year, which is not considered as having made the
hajj but is instead called the umra, the “lesser pilgrimage.”

伊斯兰教法承认朝觐不是每个穆斯林都能参加的旅行。有些人可能不够健康，世界各地的伊
斯兰慈善组织收集捐款来支持那些无法负担的人。朝圣者也可以在一年中的其他时间前往神
圣清真寺， 这不被认为是朝觐，而是被称为“umra ”，即“较小的朝圣”。


Muslims have believed throughout their history that Islam and its holy writings are not a new faith
created in the seventh century. Instead, the faith that Muhammad brought to the Arabs in the early
600s was merely a corrective to the monotheistic religions that had come before. From the
perspective of most Muslims, Islam is the same faith as Judaism and Christianity, with adherents of
all three traditions worshipping the same God and recognizing divine intercession in humanity
through the leadership of the prophets. Muslims also recognize the holy scriptures of Judaism and
Christianity as having been given to humans by God but then corrupted over time. Islam thus sees
itself as a purer form of these faiths and directly connected to both. The shared history and lineage
of the three run through the prophet Abraham, whom all list as an ancestor. Many modern scholars
of religion thus refer to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the Abrahamic faiths.

穆斯林在他们的整个历史中一直相信伊斯兰教及其神圣著作并不是七世纪创建的新信仰。相反，穆罕
默德在 600 年代初期带给阿拉伯人的信仰仅仅是对之前的一神论宗教的纠正。从大多数穆斯林的角度
来看，伊斯兰教与犹太教和基督教是相同的信仰，所有三种传统的信徒都崇拜同一个上帝，并承认通
过先知的领导对人类进行神圣的代祷。穆斯林还承认犹太教和基督教的神圣经文是上帝赐予人类的，
但随着时间的推移而被腐蚀。因此，伊斯兰教将自己视为这些信仰的更纯粹的形式，并与这两种信仰
直接相关。三人共同的历史和血统贯穿于先知亚伯拉罕，他们都被列为祖先。因此，许多现代宗教学
者将犹太教、基督教和伊斯兰教称为亚伯拉罕信仰。


For all the influence that other monotheistic worship in the region may have had on the formation of
Islam in the seventh century, however, the faith has many features we might consider uniquely Arab
or Arabian. First, of course, is the setting itself. While the land that is modern Israel and Palestine
played a central role in the narratives of Judaism and Christianity, much of the story of the formation
of Islam as a distinct religion is found in western Arabia, a region of the peninsula known as the
Hijaz. Its holiest sites lie in this region, and the life of its founder was spent almost entirely there. But more influential than
anything, perhaps, was the Muslims’ belief in the leadership and message of the man whom God
chose as his final prophet, an Arab of the early seventh century from the Hijaz of western Arabia.

尽管该地区的其他一神教崇拜可能对七世纪伊斯兰教的形成产生了影响，但该信仰具有许多我们可能
认为是阿拉伯人或阿拉伯人独有的特征。首先，当然是设定本身。虽然现代以色列和巴勒斯坦这片土
地在犹太教和基督教的叙述中发挥了核心作用，但伊斯兰教作为一种独特宗教形成的大部分故事都发
生在阿拉伯半岛西部，即被称为希贾兹的半岛地区。它最神圣的地方就在这个地区，其创始人的一生
几乎都是在那里度过的。但最有影响力的也许是穆斯林
对真主选择作为他最后一位先知的领导和信息的信仰，他是一位七世纪初来自阿拉伯西部汉志的阿拉
伯人。

Muslim tradition tells us that Muhammad was a merchant from a prominent Arab tribe called
Quraysh in the Hijaz region. Born in the city of Mecca, he ...

穆斯林传统告诉我们，穆罕默德是汉志地区一个名为古莱什的著名阿拉伯部落的商人。他出生于麦加
城.

According to Muslim belief, in the year 610 the middle-aged Muhammad, who had traveled to a
cave just outside Mecca for contemplation, received contact from God through the intermediary of
the angel Gabriel (Jabrīl in Arabic). Muhammad was told to recite the first revelations of a scripture
that became the Muslim holy book, the Quran.

根据穆斯林的信仰，公元610年，中年穆罕默德前往麦加郊外的一个山洞进行沉思，通过天使加百利
（阿拉伯语为贾布里尔）的中介得到了真主的联系。穆罕默德被告知要背诵一部后来成为穆斯林圣书
《古兰经》的经文的第一个启示。

His career as a prophet, especially the first twelve years, was
fraught with challenge. His preaching of monotheism upset the political status quo and was often
resisted.

他作为先知的职
业生涯，尤其是头十二年，充满了挑战。他宣扬的一神教扰乱了政治现状，经常遭到抵制。

In 622, Muhammad’s twelfth year of prophecy, his community fled persecution and increasing
aggression by the polytheist Meccans. They were invited to join another community of Arabs in a
city called Yathrib, later known as Medina, “the city” or more specifically “the prophet’s city.”  This hijra,
meaning “emigration,” was a watershed moment for Muhammad’s early community. At a low ebb
and without any certainty of survival, Islam now changed from a small religion mostly confined to
Mecca to a larger community united by Muhammad that solidified its place in world history. The hijra
holds such importance in the history of Islam that the Islamic lunar calendar counts 622 CE as its
first year. (Dates in the Muslim calendar, used by many around the world today, are often labeled in
English with AH, for “After the Hijra.”)

622 年，即穆罕默德预言的第十二年，他的社群逃离了多神教麦加人的迫害和日益加剧的侵略。他们被
邀请加入另一个阿拉伯社区，该社区位于一个名为亚斯里布（Yathrib）的城市，后来被称为麦地那
（Medina） ，“城市”，或更具体地说“先知之城”. 这次希吉拉（hijra ）的意思是“移民”，对于穆罕默德的早期社区来说是一
个分水岭。在低潮时期，没有任何生存的确定性，伊斯兰教现在从一个主要局限于麦加的小宗教，变
成了一个由穆罕默德联合的更大的社区，巩固了它在世界历史上的地位。回历在伊斯兰教历史上占有
如此重要的地位，以至于伊斯兰农历将公元 622 年作为其第一年。 （当今世界上许多人使用的穆斯林
日历中的日期通常用英文标记为 AH，表示“希吉拉之后”。）

Many Muslims throughout history have avoided depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad
in human form in their art, with some feeling that portraying the Prophet could be
misconstrued as idolatrous, or revering something (or someone) besides God.


历史上许多穆斯林都避免在他们的艺术中以人形描绘伊斯兰先知穆罕默德，有些人认为描绘
先知可能会被误解为偶像崇拜，或尊崇真主之外的某物（或某人）.

In Medina, the previously polytheist Arabs, Jewish Arabs, and Muhammad’s ummah formed an
alliance for their common defense. Muhammad served first as an arbiter of disputes between the
tribes and, soon after, as the city’s de facto leader. Under his guidance, the community devised the
Constitution of Medina. Later Muslim rulers saw the
constitution as a blueprint for the creation of a religious society that tolerated those of other faiths.

The phrases most commonly used in the constitution to
describe Muhammad’s followers are “Muslims” (“those who have submitted to God”) and
“believers” (al-Mu’minun). For this reason, some historians have described the earliest ummah as a
“community of believers” that was open to most monotheists. In these earliest decades of Islam,
Muhammad’s new community had much in common with the monotheistic Jewish people and
Christians, and we find little evidence of the distinctive Muslim identity that formed over the next
several centuries.

在麦地那，以前信奉多神教的阿拉伯人、犹太阿拉伯人和穆罕默德的乌玛结成联盟，共同防御。穆罕
默德首先担任部落之间争端的仲裁者，不久之后，成为这座城市事实上的领袖。在他的指导下，社区
制定了《麦地那宪法》. 后来的穆斯林统治者将宪法视为创建宗教社会的蓝图，该社会容忍其他信仰.


宪法中最常用于描述穆罕默德追随者的短语是“穆斯林”（“顺服真主的
人”）和“信徒”（ al-Mu'minun ）。因此，一些历史学家将最早的乌玛描述为对大多数一神论者开放的
“信徒社区”。在伊斯兰教的最初几十年里，穆罕默德的新群体与一神论的犹太人和基督徒有很多共同
点，我们几乎找不到证据表明在接下来的几个世纪中形成了独特的穆斯林身份。


Much of the last ten years of Muhammad’s life was spent with this
new Muslim community in Medina, engaged in conflict with their former brethren in Mecca. Fighting
between the two sides was fierce, and there were also tensions within Medina and the early ummah
as Muhammad’s followers grew in number and prominence at the expense of other Arabs in the city,
in particular, the Jewish contingent. Many on both sides were related by blood even if their religious
beliefs had altered. Muhammad’s community continued to grow and win more supporters until, on
the eve of battle outside Mecca in 630, his former tribe of Quraysh surrendered, and the population
of the city converted to Islam. Muhammad and his followers were then able to return to Mecca,
where he entered the holy sanctuary of the Kaaba, now filled with the polytheist idols worshipped by
the Arabs, and smashed them all. From the perspective of Muslims, the original house of Abraham, which had always
been dedicated to the worship of the one God, was now cleansed.

穆罕默德生命最
后十年的大部分时间是在麦地那这个新的穆斯林社区中度过的，他们与麦加的前弟兄发生了冲突。双
方之间的战斗非常激烈，麦地那和早期乌玛内部也存在紧张关系，因为穆罕默德的追随者数量和地位
不断增长，而牺牲了城市中的其他阿拉伯人，特别是犹太队伍。双方许多人都有血缘关系，即使他们
的宗教信仰发生了变化。穆罕默德的社群不断壮大并赢得了更多支持者，直到 630 年麦加城外的战斗
前夕，他以前的古莱什部落投降，该城的居民皈依了伊斯兰教。穆罕默德和他的追随者随后得以返回
麦加，在那里他进入了天房的神圣圣地，那里现在充满了阿拉伯人崇拜的多神教偶像，并将它们全部
打碎。从穆斯林的角度来看，原来一直供
奉独一真主的亚伯拉罕之家现在已经被净化了。





When Muhammad died in 632 CE, members of the early Muslim ummah needed to immediately
answer several important questions. Who was capable of now leading the community, of following in
the footsteps of a leader who claimed prophecy—the ability to communicate with God—when none
of those who remained could do so? Another critical question was about the survival of the
community: what, exactly, had Muhammad accomplished by uniting the Arab tribes, and where
would they go from here?


当穆罕默德于公元 632 年去世时，早期穆斯林乌玛的成员需要立即回答几个重要问题。现在谁有能力
领导社区，追随一位声称有预言（与上帝沟通的能力）的领导人的脚步，而剩下的人都无法做到这一
点？另一个关键问题是关于社区的生存：穆罕默德通过团结阿拉伯部落到底完成了什么？他们将何去
何从？

Arab tribes had come together for a common cause in the pre-Islamic period, such as a war against
another tribe or recognition of the strength of a chieftain. But once that cause had been
accomplished or that chieftain had died, the confederacy typically disbanded.

在前伊斯兰时期，阿拉伯部落为了共同的事业而聚集在一起，例如与另一个部落的战争或承认酋长的
力量。但一旦这一目标完成或酋长去世，联盟通常就会解散.

In many tribal- and clan-based societies like that of the Arabs, leadership was not
hereditary, meaning it did not immediately pass to the heir upon the death of the leader. Thus, as
Muhammad was dying, two primary claimants for leadership emerged: his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi
Talib, and a friend and confidant of Muhammad’s named Abu Bakr.

In the end, Abu Bakr was chosen to be the first successor to
Muhammad.

在许多以部落和氏族为基础的社会中，
比如阿拉伯人，领导权不是世袭的，这意味着领导权死后不会立即传给继承人。因此，当穆罕默德弥
留之际，出现了两位主要的领导权争夺者：他的女婿阿里·本·阿比·塔利卜，以及穆罕默德的朋友和知己
阿布·伯克尔。
最终，阿布伯克尔被选为
穆罕默德的第一任继承人.


There seems to have been near immediate recognition that things without Muhammad would be
different, not least of which because the caliph was not assuming the mantle of another prophet
capable of communicating directly with God as Muhammad had.

但人们似乎立即认识到，没有穆罕默德，事情将会有
所不同，尤其是因为哈里发没有承担另一位先知的衣钵能够像穆罕默德一样直接与真主沟通。

Tensions arose after Muhammad’s death not just over leadership and inheritance, but also over
whether the alliance was ever intended to last beyond its founder. Some Arab tribes left to return to
their homes, while others may have believed they could discard their commitment to the worship of
the one God and membership in this confederation. From the perspective of the Muslims, however,
this was apostasy, and a conflict known as the Ridda Wars then began in an attempt to force these
Arab tribes to continue to honor their agreements with the Muslims. The Ridda Wars also appear to
have been expansionist, bringing into the fold, whether by treaty or force, Arab tribes that had never
been aligned with Muhammad’s community during his lifetime. This effort was the first step of a
wider movement called the Arab-Islamic or Arab-Muslim conquests, and by 633 the entirety of
Arabia had been brought under the control of this first Islamic state.

穆罕默德去世后，不仅在领导权和继承权问题上出现了紧张局势，而且在联盟是否打算在其创始人之
后继续存在的问题上也出现了紧张局势。一些阿拉伯部落离开返回家园，而其他部落可能认为他们可
以放弃对独一真主的崇拜和加入这个联盟的承诺。然而，从穆斯林的角度来看，这是叛教，随后一场
被称为里达战争的冲突开始了，试图迫使这些阿拉伯部落继续遵守与穆斯林的协议。里达战争似乎也
是扩张主义的，无论是通过条约还是武力，都将在穆罕默德生前从未与他的社区结盟的阿拉伯部落纳
入其中。这一努力是被称为“阿拉伯伊斯兰征服”或“阿拉伯穆斯林征服”的更广泛运动的第一步，到 633
年，整个阿拉伯半岛 已被置于第一个伊斯兰国家的控制之下。




Abu Bakr did not live long after Muhammad, and the conquest movement did not stop with his
leadership, nor with uniting just the Arab tribes under the banner of Islam. The new state’s
expansionist desire seems to have existed from the outset, and the Arab-Muslim armies turned their
attention northward to the old empires of Sasanian Persia and Byzantium.  The Arab-Muslims may have felt
emboldened by their successes in Arabia, seeing them as recognition of God’s favor and of their
destiny to rule the world.


阿布伯克尔在穆罕默德去世后不久，征服运动并没有随着他的领导而停止，也没有仅仅将阿拉伯部落
统一在伊斯兰教的旗帜下。新国家的扩张欲望似乎从一开始就存在，阿拉伯穆斯林军队将注意力转向
北方的萨珊波斯和拜占庭老帝国。阿拉伯穆斯林可能因他们在阿拉伯的成功而感到鼓
舞，认为这是对上帝恩惠和他们统治世界的命运的认可。

Religious belief and zeal are difficult for historians to quantify, but we have seen throughout history
that nomadic and seminomadic societies must forcefully seek the resources they need to survive.


历史学家很难量化宗教信仰和热情，但我们在历史上看到，游牧和半游牧社会必须大力寻求生存所需
的资源

It was not always clear that the Arab-Muslims would be successful against the Byzantines and the
Persians, the last empires of antiquity. Nonetheless, starting in 634 and continuing into the early
eighth century, they found enormous success conquering much of the territory around the
Mediterranean basin and central Asia. The new Islamic state, or caliphate (an area under the control of a
caliph), was larger than the realm of Alexander the Great, the Romans, or the Han Chinese; it was
the largest empire the world had yet seen.

人们并不总是清楚阿拉伯穆斯林能否成功对抗古代最后的帝国拜占庭和波斯。尽管如此，从 634 年开
始一直持续到 8 世纪初，他们取得了巨大的成功，征服了地中海盆地和中亚周围的大部分领土. 新的伊斯兰国家，或称哈里发国（哈里发控制下的
地区），比亚历山大大帝、罗马人或汉人的领土还要大。它是世界上迄今为止最大的帝国。

The crucial early years of Islamic expansion were overseen by the first four caliphs, a group of rulers
who came to be called the “rightly guided” or Rashidun. These four figures—Abu Bakr, Umar,
Uthman, and the originally overlooked son-in-law of Muhammad, Ali—ruled between 632 and 661, a
period when much Byzantine and Persian territory was conquered.

伊斯兰扩张的关键早期岁月是由前四位哈里发监督的，这群统治者后来被称为“正统”或“拉希敦”。这四
位人物——阿布·伯克尔（Abu Bakr ）、欧麦尔（Umar） 、奥斯曼（Othman ）和原本被忽视的穆罕
默德女婿阿里（Ali） ——在 632 年至 661 年间统治，这一时期拜占庭和波斯的大部分领土被征服.




Still, the conquest of Persia proved to be a longer-term process. Sasanian-controlled territory was
vast and geographically diverse, and the independence the Sasanian nobility had wrested from the
central government following the war with the Byzantines meant the Arab-Muslims needed to
negotiate with many local governors and landed elites for the surrender of their territory.

尽管如此，事实证明征服波斯是一个长期的过程。萨珊王朝控制的领土幅员辽阔，地理分布多样，萨
珊贵族在与拜占庭人的战争后从中央政府手中夺取了独立，这意味着阿拉伯穆斯林需要与许多地方总
督和土地精英进行谈判才能交出他们的领土。


By the 650s, the Byzantine Empire
survived the Arab-Muslim conquests, but it never again controlled much of the territory of the old
Roman east. The entirety of the Persian Empire had effectively been brought into the control of
the new Islamic state.

到了 650 年代，拜占
庭帝国在阿拉伯穆斯林的征服中幸存下来，但它再也没有控制过古罗马东部的大部分领土。整个波斯帝国实际上已经被纳入新的伊斯
兰国家的控制之下。

Calling these events the “Arab-Muslim conquests” is somewhat misleading, however. While the first
years of expansion did see several major battles, most of the
territory came under Islamic control through peace agreements. Cities and regions agreed to terms
of surrender that protected their residents, many of their belongings, and their right to practice their
religion. Peaceful agreements made sense for non-Muslim populations. Especially during the
seventh century, the Muslims maintained a policy of noninterference toward the religious practices
of subject populations. As long as they paid taxes to their new Muslim government, the conquered
could live in the Islamic state and still practice their religion somewhat freely.


然而，将这些事件称为“阿拉伯穆斯林的征服”有些误导。虽然扩张的最初几年确实发生了几场重大战
役，但大部分领土通过和平协议受到伊斯兰控制。城市和地区同意投降条
款，以保护其居民、他们的许多财产以及他们信奉宗教的权利。和平协议对非穆斯林人口有意义。特
别是在七世纪，穆斯林对臣民的宗教活动实行不干涉政策。只要他们向新的穆斯林政府纳税，被征服

who lived under their rule. They referred to them as ahl al-kitab, or People of the Book, which
recognized them as monotheists who had received a revealed scripture from God in the past, and
who were worthy of protection by the Islamic state so long as they paid taxes and submitted to
Muslim rule. For many, this situation was an improvement on their earlier lives. Under Byzantine rule,
for instance, those who did not follow the official Christian religion of the empire were often
discriminated against. They could be barred from holding certain jobs, charged extra taxes, and
otherwise be badly treated as heretics. For Jewish populations, the situation had often been even
harsher. Many had been unable to openly practice their faith or gather outside the synagogue. While
they were not officially monotheists and were not seen as having a revealed scripture, Zoroastrians
under the Muslims were still treated as People of the Book, likely for pragmatic reasons owing to
their noble status in Persian society.

穆斯林为生活在他们统治下的犹太人、基督徒和琐罗亚斯德教徒制定了法律分类。他们称他们为“ahl
al-kitab” ，即“有经之人” ，承认他们是一神论者，他们在过去从上帝那里得到了启示的经文，只要他
们缴纳税款和收入，就值得伊斯兰国家的保护。服从穆斯林统治。对于许多人来说，这种情况比他们
早年的生活有所改善。例如，在拜占庭统治下，那些不信奉帝国官方基督教的人经常受到歧视。他们
可能被禁止担任某些工作，收取额外的税款，或者被视为异端分子。对于犹太人来说，情况往往更加
严峻。许多人无法公开实践他们的信仰或聚集在犹太教堂外。虽然他们不是正式的一神论者，也不被
视为拥有天启的经文，但穆斯林统治下的琐罗亚斯德教徒仍然被视为圣书之民，这可能是出于务实的
原因，因为他们在 波斯社会的高贵地位。

The term “Arab-Muslim conquest” has another drawback in that some participants were non-Arabs. Other fighters were Arabs but had not necessarily formally converted to Islam. In the end, the most important differentiator of status in this earliest society was not Arab versus
non-Arab or Muslim versus non-Muslim, but rather conqueror versus conquered.

“阿拉伯-穆斯林征服”一词还有一个缺点，那就是一些参与者不是阿拉伯人. 其他战士是阿拉伯人，但不一定正式皈依伊斯兰教. 在这个最早的社会中，最重要的地位区别不是阿拉伯人与非阿拉伯人，也不是穆斯林与非穆斯
林，而是征服者与被征服者。



The Rashidun caliphs are remembered not just for overseeing the process of conquest in the region
but also for helping to articulate what Muhammad’s ummah should look like, and what made Islam
different from other monotheistic religions such as Judaism and Christianity. The first four caliphs
committed to writing a canonized Quran and helped interpret and articulate the religious law.

Together, the Quran and the hadith make up the bulk of religious law for Muslims to the
present day, and the Rashidun caliphs have long been regarded as interpreters of this material for
later Muslims who were not able to interact with Muhammad themselves.

Among the most important for the hadith was Muhammad’s
youngest wife Aisha, whose achievements as a transmitter and interpreter of Islamic law in the
decades following her husband’s death cannot be understated.

拉希顿哈里发之所以被人们铭记，不仅是因为他们监督了该地区的征服过程，还因为他们帮助阐明了
穆罕默德的乌玛应该是什么样子，以及伊斯兰教与犹太教和基督教等其他一神论宗教的不同之处。前
四位哈里发致力于撰写一部经典的《古兰经》 ，并帮助解释和阐明宗教法。

《古兰经》和《圣训》一起构成了当今穆斯林宗教法的主体，而拉什
顿哈里发长期以来一直被视为这些材料的解释者，为后来无法与穆罕默德互动的穆斯林提供了依据。对圣训最重要的人物之一是穆罕默德最年轻的妻子艾莎，她在丈夫去世后的几十年里作为伊斯兰
法律的传播者和解释者所取得的成就不可低估。

With Ali’s death, the Umayyads, led by Mu‘awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, established Islam’s first hereditary
dynasty. Moving the capital of their state from the Prophet’s city of Medina to the Syrian city of
Damascus.


阿里去世后，穆阿维叶·本·阿比·苏菲扬领导的倭马亚王朝建立了伊斯兰教第一个世袭王朝。他们将国家
首都从先知的城市麦地那迁至叙利亚城市大马士革.

Within the running of the state,
too, many government officials in these early decades—in positions from tax collector to scribe at
the court of the ruler—were non-Muslim holdovers from the Byzantines and Persians. They helped
the early Muslim rulers establish and administer a government the size of which they had never
experienced.

在国家管理方面，在最初的几十年里，许多政府官员——从税
吏到统治者宫廷的抄写员——都是拜占庭人和波斯人的非穆斯林后裔。他们帮助早期的穆斯林统治者
建立和管理一个他们从未经历过的规模的政府。


Little written material of the seventh-century Arab-Muslim conquerors survives. The earliest Islamic caliphs had mimicked the styles and motifs of their Byzantine and
Persian rivals to justify their rule and demonstrate a continuity of government.

The culture started to change after the second Islamic civil war in the early 690s. The
victors, a branch of the Umayyad family, began to make the empire look increasingly Arab.
Their governmental reforms included the gradual removal of signs and symbols associated
with the old Byzantine and Persian rulers, such as Christian crosses on coins ).

关于七世纪阿拉伯穆斯林征服者的书面材料几乎没有留存下来。最早的伊斯兰哈里发模仿拜占庭和波斯竞争对手的风格和主题，以证明他们的统治合理并证
明政府的连续性。

690 年代初第二次伊斯兰内战后，文化开始发生变化。胜利者是倭马亚家族的一个分支，他们
开始使帝国看起来越来越阿拉伯化。他们的政府改革包括逐步取消与旧拜占庭和波斯统治者
相关的标志和符号，例如硬币上的基督教十字架。(如同中国, 去西方化，而凸显中国糟粕，国学, 中医等)

As they worked to establish a new empire that was quickly growing beyond their ability to
administer on their own, the Arab-Muslims relied on the continued employment of former Byzantine
and Persian bureaucrats to help with the running of the state. But by the eighth century they were rapidly being shunned in favor of Arabs. In some cases,
non-Muslims were passed over for the best positions, while in other situations, new converts to
Islam grew increasingly frustrated at not being considered full members of the conquering elite.

当阿拉伯穆斯林努力建立一个迅速发
展超出其自身管理能力的新帝国时，他们依靠继续雇用前拜占庭和波斯官僚来帮助管理国家。但到了八世
纪，他们很快就被阿拉伯人避开。在某些情况下，非穆斯林被排除在最佳职位之外，而在其他情况
下，新皈依伊斯兰教的人因不被视为征服精英的正式成员而变得越来越沮丧。


The last decades of Umayyad rule were defined by factionalism and infighting. There, in the province of Khurasan, Arab-
Muslims had settled after the conquests, often intermarrying with the Indigenous Persians (Figure
11.18). By the mid-eighth century, several generations of these mixed-ethnicity Muslims had come
to feel disenfranchised in the region, and Khurasan became a hotbed of revolutionary activity. Many
who were frustrated with Umayyad rule and ready for a change met to imagine a more open Islamic
community.

倭马亚王朝最后几十年的统治充满了派系斗争和内讧。征服之后，阿拉伯穆斯林在呼罗
珊省定居下来，经常与土著波斯人通婚。到了八世纪中叶，几代混血穆斯林开始感到在
该地区被剥夺了公民权，呼罗珊成为革命活动的温床。许多对倭马亚统治感到沮丧并准备进行变革的
人会面，想象一个更加开放的伊斯兰社会.



This revolutionary group championed the right of the family of Muhammad to hold the position of
caliph. Its members supported the claims of the descendants of Ibn Abbas, a first cousin of
Muhammad, and thus came to be known as the Abbasids. In 749, after several years of growing
dissatisfaction, they rose in rebellion against the Umayyads, overthrowing Islam’s first dynasty
within a year and establishing themselves as the new rulers of the Middle East. Abbasids claimed
the title of caliph from the year 750 through to the early sixteenth century, although the power they
sought waxed and waned over time.

这个革命团体捍卫穆罕默德家族担任哈里发职位的权利。其成员支持穆罕默德的堂弟伊本·阿拔斯后裔
的主张，因此被称为阿拔斯王朝。 749年，经过几年的不满，他们起兵反抗倭马亚王朝，一年之内推翻
了伊斯兰教第一个王朝，成为中东的新统治者。阿拔斯王朝从 750 年到 16 世纪初一直声称拥有哈里发
的头衔，尽管他们寻求的权力随着时间的推移而减弱。

The decision to move the focus of Islamic rule further east also signaled a significant shift in the
region’s politics and economics. The inhabitants of the former Persian Empire had played an integral
role in helping the Abbasids to rise, and they became a major power base for the dynasty as it
advanced.

将伊斯兰统治重心进一步向东转移的决定也标志着该地区政治和经济的重大转变。前波斯帝国的居民
在帮助阿巴斯王朝崛起的过程中发挥了不可或缺的作用，随着王朝的发展，他们成为了主要的权力基
础。


The early Abbasids strongly supported learning and fostered what is now called the Abbasid Translation Movement, or the Greco-Arabic
Translation Movement. The Abbasids’ patronage of scholarly work proved the
catalyst for an explosion of medieval learning.

早期的阿拔斯王朝大力支持学习，并培育了现在所谓的阿拔斯翻译运
动，或希腊阿拉伯语翻译运动。阿拔斯王朝对学术作品的赞助被证明是中世纪学术爆炸式增长的催化
剂。

The Abbasids sought to preserve the knowledge of past societies by translating the works of the
ancient world into Arabic, especially from Greek and Persian, as the Islamic world transitioned from
an oral to a writerly society during the ninth century. Writing and scholarly research were not always
well funded in the premodern world, so wealthy patrons, including the caliph himself, provided
financial support to scholars capable of completing this work.

随着伊斯兰世界在九世纪从口头社会转变为书面社会，阿巴斯王朝试图通过将古代世界的著作翻译成
阿拉伯语，特别是希腊语和波斯语来保存过去社会的知识。在前现代世界，写作和学术研究并不总是
有充足的资金，因此包括哈里发本人在内的富有的赞助人为有能力完成这项工作的学者提供了财政支
持。

The achievements of the translation movement were considerable, preserving many incredibly
important astrological, geographic, mathematical, medical, and other scientific and philosophical
texts in Arabic at a time when non-Arabic copies had become increasingly rare. These texts
included seminal works by the Greek thinkers Aristotle, Dioscorides, Galen, Hippocrates, and
Ptolemy.

翻译运动取得了巨大的成就，在非阿拉伯语副本变得越来越稀有的时候，用阿拉伯语保存了许多极其
重要的占星学、地理、数学、医学和其他科学和哲学文本。这些文本包括希腊思想家亚里士多德、迪
奥斯科里德斯、盖伦、希波克拉底和托勒密的开创性著作.

A major goal of the translation movement was not just to preserve but also to correct and expand
them.

要目标不仅是保存它们，而且是纠正和扩展它们。

The catalyst for the formation of denominations within Islam was a growing divide between the
groups now known as the Sunni and the Shia (sometimes written as Shi‘ite), the two primary
“umbrella sects” within Islam.

伊斯兰教内部形成教派的催化剂是现在被称为逊尼派和什叶派（有时写为什叶派）的群体之间日益扩
大的分歧. 这两个群体是伊斯兰教内部的两个主要“伞教派”。

The role of the caliph as a leader in the Islamic world also began to change dramatically in the
Middle Ages. As the Abbasids
came to power, a religious clerical class also arose within Islam. Known as the ulama (literally “the
scholars”), they came to hold an increasingly important role as the interpreters of Islamic law within
non-Shia, Sunni Islam during the Abbasid period.

哈里发作为伊斯兰世界领袖的角色在中世纪也开始发生巨大变化。随着阿拔斯王朝掌权，伊斯兰教内部也兴起了一个宗教神职人员阶级。他们被称
为“乌里玛”（字面意思是“学者”），在阿拔斯王朝时期，他们在非什叶派、逊尼派伊斯兰教中作为伊斯
兰法律的解释者发挥着越来越重要的作用.

Before the Abbasid period, the early caliphs had successfully made a case for being vested with
both secular and religious authority, including the ability to interpret the scripture and issue religious
proclamations. As the ulama acquired a more prominent role in Abbasid society, however, they
claimed more of this power and authority for themselves, diminishing the religious entitlements that
earlier caliphs had claimed. As the centuries passed, the religious role of the caliph weakened
further, and the decision to compile and write down the hadith, which had been transmitted only
orally for the bulk of the first two centuries, gave further authority to the keepers and teachers of this
material at the expense of the caliph within early Sunni Islam.

在阿拔斯王朝时期之前，早期的哈里发已经成功地获得了世俗和宗教权威，包括解释圣经和发布宗教
公告的能力。然而，随着乌里玛在阿拔斯社会中扮演更重要的角色，他们为自己主张了更多的权力和
权威，从而削弱了早期哈里发所主张的宗教权利。随着几个世纪的过去，哈里发的宗教角色进一步削
弱，而编纂和写下圣训的决定，在前两个世纪的大部分时间里仅以口头形式传播，这给了圣训的守护
者和导师进一步的权威。早期逊尼派伊斯兰教中以牺牲哈里发为代价的物质。

What was it like for Indigenous peoples of captured territories to live under Islamic rule during the
Umayyad and Abbasid periods? What is surprising is that the majority
of these inhabitants were not Muslims themselves. Non-Muslims were allowed to keep their religion and
continue to live under Islamic rule by paying a special tax.

在倭马亚王朝和阿拔斯王朝时期，被占领领土上的原住民在伊斯兰统治下生活是什么样的？令人惊讶的是，这些居民中
的大多数本身并不是穆斯林。非穆斯林可以通过缴纳特别税来保留
自己的宗教信仰并继续生活在伊斯兰统治下。

For example, a Muslim generally could not marry a non-Muslim under Islamic law, but if such a
marriage occurred, a Muslim woman’s future husband had to convert to Islam to marry her, and the
children of a Muslim husband had to be raised as Muslim. Thus, it seems likely that the process of
conversion to Islam at this time was quite slow and that the Muslims remained a numeric minority
for centuries even though they wielded the majority of power in the empire.

根据伊斯兰法律，穆斯林一般不能与非穆斯林结婚，但如果发生这种婚姻，穆斯林妇女未来的
丈夫必须皈依伊斯兰教才能与她结婚，而穆斯林丈夫的孩子必须像穆斯林一样抚养长大。穆斯林。因
此，此时皈依伊斯兰教的过程似乎相当缓慢，尽管穆斯林在帝国中掌握着多数权力，但几个世纪以来
他们仍然是少数。
