The Rise of Mercantilism

重商主义的兴起

Much European exploration was driven by an economic theory known as mercantilism. According to this theory, a nation’s power depended on the
amount of gold and silver it held.  Amassing national wealth, in turn, depended on maintaining
a favorable balance of trade, a situation in which a country exports goods of greater value than it
imports. Mercantilism also assumed that the world’s wealth as measured in gold and silver was
finite, so a gain for one nation was a loss for another. To surpass other nations in power, a country
must possess more gold and silver than others. According to mercantilism, there could be only one
victor in economic competition.

欧洲的许多探索都是由一种被称为重商主义的经济理论推动的. 根据这一理论，一个国家的实力取决于它所拥有的金银数量。反过来，国家财富的积累取决于维持贸易顺差，即一个国家出
口商品价值高于进口商品的情况。重商主义还认为，以黄金和白银衡量的世界财富是有限的，因此一
个国家的收益就是另一个国家的损失(即零和博弈)。一个国家要想超越其他国家，就必须拥有比其他国家更多的金
银。根据重商主义，经济竞争中只能有一个胜利者。


When a nation sold goods abroad, it accumulated gold and silver, but when it imported foreign
products, it had to transfer gold and silver to other nations as payment. Thus, at the heart of
mercantilism lay the need for a nation to maximize its exports and minimize its imports. Indeed, the
ideal was to import nothing and produce everything in the home country, including agricultural
produce. A nation that could not supply all its own needs should import raw materials, transform
them into finished products, and sell them abroad for more money than it had cost to produce them.
Any raw materials a nation possessed should be reserved for domestic manufacturing.

当一个国家向国外出售商品时，它积累了金银，但当它进口外国产品时，它必须将金银转移给其他国
家作为支付。因此，重商主义的核心在于一个国家需要最大化其出口并最小化其进口。事实上，理想
的状态是不进口任何东西，并在本国生产一切，包括农产品。一个无法满足自身所有需求的国家应该
进口原材料，将其转化为成品，然后以高于其生产成本的价格出售到国外。一个国家拥有的任何原材
料都应该保留用于国内制造。


In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, mercantilist theory was embraced by most European
nations, especially France and England. Perhaps as much as religious fervor and a thirst for
knowledge, this premise drove exploration and the establishment of colonies. Mercantilists believed
a colonial empire was necessary for economic domination. Colonies could supply raw materials for
domestic consumption, so there was no need to purchase these resources from others. Colonial
populations, in turn, provided a ready market for goods made in the home country. To ensure that
colonies added to their national wealth, European countries that established them usually required
that they trade only with the home country. Thus, for example, England’s colonies in North America
could sell what they produced only in England.

十六、十七世纪，重商主义理论被大多数欧洲国家，特别是法国和英国所接受。也许与宗教热情和对
知识的渴望一样，这一前提推动了探索和殖民地的建立。重商主义者认为殖民帝国对于经济统治是必
要的。殖民地可以为国内消费提供原材料，因此没有必要从其他国家购买这些资源。反过来，殖民地
人口为本国制造的商品提供了现成的市场。为了确保殖民地增加其国家财富，建立殖民地的欧洲国家
通常要求它们只与母国进行贸易。例如，英国在北美的殖民地只能出售他们只在英国生产的产品。


Most mercantilist theorists believed government regulation of the economy was necessary to
maximize wealth. Governments commonly prohibited certain imports to prevent them from
competing with domestic industry. In 1539, for example, to protect domestic textile manufacturing,
France banned the import of goods made of wool. Governments also imposed high tariffs, or taxes
on imported goods. These made foreign products more expensive and thus promoted development
of a nation’s own industries. Governments might also grant firms monopolies over certain kinds of
domestic production, establish and provide financial support for certain industries to ensure
domestic self-sufficiency, and pay for internal improvements, such as new roads, to promote
domestic manufacturing and commerce. They also maintained large navies to protect international
trade and defend foreign colonies.

大多数重商主义理论家认为，为了实现财富最大化，政府对经济的监管是必要的。政府通常禁止某些
进口，以防止它们与国内工业竞争。例如，1539年，为了保护国内纺织制造业，法国禁止进口羊毛制
品。政府还对进口商品征收高额关税。这些使得外国产品变得更加昂贵，从而促进了本国工业的发
展。政府还可以授予企业对某些国内生产的垄断权，为某些行业建立并提供财政支持以确保国内自给
自足，并支付内部改进费用，例如修建新道路，以促进国内制造业和商业。他们还拥有庞大的海军来
保护国际贸易和保卫外国殖民地。

France provides perhaps the preeminent example of the mercantilist theory in practice. France was
an absolute monarchy. Absolute monarchies appeared in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries as feudalism declined and new countries arose from medieval kingdoms. These new
nation-states were characterized by centralized administrations and codified laws. They were
guarded by professional standing armies, not noble vassals at the head of their own private armies.

法国也许是重商主义理论在实践中的杰出范例。法国是一个绝对君主制国家。十六、十七世纪，随着
封建主义的衰落和中世纪王国中新国家的崛起，欧洲出现了绝对君主制。这些新的民族国家的特点是
中央集权的行政管理和成文的法律。他们由专业的常备军守卫，而不是由贵族封臣率领自己的私人军
队。

At the head of the state stood a monarch (usually a king) who claimed a divine right to rule. The
medieval concept of monarchy had regarded kings as subservient to the pope, but absolute
monarchs considered themselves subordinate to no one. They could rule as they wished with no
need to confer with or seek the consent of others, or to share power with the noble class as
medieval monarchs had done. Absolute monarchs proclaimed their own laws, formulated foreign
policy, administered justice (or appointed those who did so), and imposed taxes as they wished.
They were the sole source of authority in their lands and often took steps to weaken the power of
their nobles so they did not pose a threat to their rule.

国家元首是一位君主（通常是国王），他声称拥有神圣的统治权。中世纪的君主制概念认为国王服从
教皇，但绝对君主认为自己不服从任何人。他们可以按照自己的意愿进行统治，无需与他人协商或寻
求他人的同意，也无需像中世纪君主那样与贵族阶级分享权力。绝对君主宣布自己的法律，制定外交
政策，执行司法（或任命司法人员），并按照自己的意愿征收税收。他们是自己土地上的唯一权威来
源，经常采取措施削弱贵族的权力，以免贵族对其统治构成威胁。(就如同中国皇帝一样)


The most powerful of the absolute monarchies was France, and Louis XIV, who became king of
France in 1643, was the epitome of a divine-right monarch. Unwilling to share power with the higherranked
members of the French nobility, who had been responsible for numerous revolts against the
French monarchy in the decades before he came to the throne, Louis deprived them of any role in
governing or administering the state. He required that they live with him at his magnificent palace in
Versailles, where they were invited to spend their time and money (which might otherwise have been
used to plot revolts) in putting on displays of ostentatious living and competing with one another for
the king’s favor. All state matters were rigorously scrutinized by Louis, and he promulgated legal codes for
France’s colonies. “L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state”), he once famously proclaimed.

君主专制国家中最强大的是法国，1643年成为法国国王的路易十四就是君权神授的典型。路易不愿与
法国贵族中的高级成员分享权力，在他登基之前的几十年里，这些贵族曾多次发动反对法国君主制的
叛乱，路易剥夺了他们在治理或管理国家方面的任何作用。他要求他们和他一起住在他位于凡尔赛的
宏伟宫殿里，在那里他们被邀请花时间和金钱（否则这些钱可能会被用来策划叛乱）展示奢华的生
活，并相互竞争国王的权力。所
有国家事务都受到路易的严格审查，他并为法国
殖民地颁布法律法规。他曾经说过一句著名的话：“ L'état, c'est moi ”（“我就是国家”）。

France embraced
mercantilism under the guidance of Jean-Baptiste Colbert. As the controller-general of finances, Colbert sought to promote French manufacturing and
foreign trade and decrease imports. Under his direction, the government increased tariffs on foreignmade
goods and completely banned the importation of some such as lace.

。法国在让-巴蒂斯特·科尔贝尔 (Jean-Baptiste Colbert)的领导下拥抱重商主义. 作为财政总督，科尔贝尔寻求促进法国制造业和对外贸易并减少进
口。在他的指导下，政府提高了外国制造商品的关税，并完全禁止蕾丝等一些商品的进口。

Colbert established a merchant marine to carry French goods abroad for trade, reducing the nation’s
reliance on ships from other countries. Because the
merchant marine could be called upon in time of war, Colbert had thus also strengthened France’s
ability to engage in armed conflict with foreign powers.

科尔伯特建立了一支商船队，将法国货物运往国外进行贸易，减少了该国对其他国家船只的依赖。由于战时可以调用商
船队，科尔伯特也因此增强了法国与外国列强发生武装冲突的能力。


Mercantilist theory influenced England and the Netherlands too. Although England’s Parliament did
not exert as much control over its economy as the monarchy exerted in France, it nevertheless took
steps to promote English trade and discourage the importation of foreign goods. Tariffs were placed
on foreign products, and in the second half of the seventeenth century, laws were passed requiring
that all ships bringing goods to England have English owners and a predominantly English crew. The
Dutch adopted the mercantilist strategy of exporting high-quality goods to make up for the money the resource-poor country spent on raw materials supplied by
other nations.

重商主义理论也影响了英国和荷兰。尽管英国议会对其经济的控制程度不如法国君主制，但它仍然采
取措施促进英国贸易并阻止外国商品的进口。对外国产品征收关税，并在十七世纪下半叶通过了法
律，要求所有向英国运送货物的船只都必须由英国船主和以英国人为主的船员组成。荷兰采取了重商
主义战略，出口优质商品，以弥补这个资源贫乏国家花在其他国家供应
的原材料上的钱。

Like France, both England and the Netherlands granted monopolies on foreign trade to private
companies—the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. The purpose was to
prevent competition among merchants that might drive up the prices they were willing to pay for
foreign goods and drive down the prices they charged for domestic goods sold abroad. To increase
their access to raw materials and establish new markets for their goods, the Dutch, English, and
French, noting the success of Spain and Portugal, also set out to establish colonies in the Americas.
A colonial empire seemed essential to securing national wealth and power.

与法国一样，英国和荷兰都将对外贸易垄断权授予私营公司——英国东印度公司和荷兰东印度公司。
目的是防止商人之间的竞争，这种竞争可能会抬高他们愿意为外国商品支付的价格，并压低他们在国
外销售的国内商品的价格。为了增加获得原材料的机会并为其商品建立新的市场，荷兰人、英国人和
法国人在注意到西班牙和葡萄牙的成功之后，也开始在美洲建立殖民地。殖民帝国似乎对于确保国家
财富和权力至关重要。



Mercantilism and the Expansion of Empire

重商主义与帝国的扩张



To compete with Spain and Portugal, their rivals England, France, and the Netherlands soon founded
communities in North America. England established colonies on the mainland of North America in
the sixteenth century, and by the middle of the eighteenth century, they stretched from
Newfoundland to Georgia.  The colonies attracted many landless, unemployed young European men and
women, too, who traveled to North America as indentured servants, bound by a contract to work for
an agreed-upon number of years. After the landowner who paid for their passage had been
compensated by their years of labor, indentured servants received their freedom and typically a
grant of land as well.

为了与西班牙和葡萄牙竞争，他们的对手英格兰、法国和荷兰很快在北美建立了社区。英国于十六世
纪在北美大陆建立殖民地，到十八世纪中叶，殖民地从纽芬兰延伸到乔治亚州. 这些殖民地也吸引了许多无地、失业的欧洲青年男女，他们以契约仆人的身份前往北美，并
受合同约束，在约定的年限内工作。在支付旅费的土地所有者通过多年的劳动获得补偿后，契约仆人
获得了自由，通常还获得了土地。

Europe’s Footprint in the Americas. By the early seventeenth
century, Spain, Portugal, England, France, and the Netherlands all had
established colonies in the Americas. Spain’s empire was the largest.

欧洲在美洲的足迹。到了十七世纪初，西班牙、葡萄牙、英国、法国、荷
兰都在美洲建立了殖民地。西班牙帝国是最大的。

France and the Netherlands also founded colonies in North America. In 1535, Jacques Cartier
claimed Canada, also called New France, in the name of King Francis I. Like England, France was
unable to maintain a permanent settlement in North America until the seventeenth century, when
Samuel de Champlain founded one at Quebec. The French established further settlements in what
is now the state of Maine, on the southern coast of Newfoundland, and in Louisiana (named for King
Louis XIV).  Like the
French, the Dutch colonists of New Netherlands were primarily engaged in the fur trade, although
many Dutch farmers also settled in the Hudson Valley, in New Jersey, and on Long Island.


法国和荷兰也在北美建立了殖民地。 1535年，雅克·卡地亚以国王弗朗西斯一世的名义宣称拥有加拿
大，也称为新法兰西。与英国一样，法国直到十七世纪才在北美建立永久定居点，当时萨缪尔·德·尚普
兰在魁北克建立了一个永久定居点。法国人在现在的缅因州、纽芬兰南部海岸和路易斯安那州（以国
王路易十四命名）建立了更多的定居点。与法国人一样，新荷兰的荷兰
殖民者主要从事毛皮贸易，尽管许多荷兰农民也定居在该地区。哈德逊河谷、新泽西州和长岛。


In 1627, the French
government granted a monopoly over the fur trade to the Company of New France. All fur trappers in
Canada were to either work directly for the company or sell their furs to it. Traders had to pay the
government a 25 percent sales tax. In 1663, Louis XIV placed the company under royal control.

1627年，法国政府将毛皮贸易的垄断权授予新法兰西公司。加拿大的所有毛皮捕猎者要么直
接为该公司工作，要么将其毛皮出售给该公司。贸易商必须向政府缴纳 25% 的销售税。 1663 年，路
易十四将公司置于皇家控制之下。


Spain exercised the strictest control over colonial commerce. Trade was limited to only a few ports
in the Spanish colonies and the port of Seville in Spain.  In addition,
those seeking to engage in trade had to procure a license to do so, at considerable expense.

西班牙对殖民地商业实行最严格的控制。贸易仅限于西班牙殖民地的几个港口和西班牙的塞维利亚
港. 此外，那些寻
求从事贸易的人必须花费相当大的费用才能获得许可证。


Although the mainland colonies yielded wealth for the European home countries, the chief prizes
were the islands of the Caribbean where sugar could be grown. Over the course of the seventeenth
century, England, France, and the Netherlands set up colonies throughout the Caribbean on islands
either not claimed by Spain or taken from it. The three attempted to found colonies in Central or
South America as well, but Spanish and Portuguese dominance there either made these efforts
unsuccessful, like the Dutch attempts in Brazil, or they kept the colonies small, such as French
Guiana and Dutch Guiana, now Suriname.

尽管大陆殖民地为欧洲母国带来了财富，但最主要的收获是可以种植糖的加勒比海岛屿。在十七世
纪，英国、法国和荷兰在整个加勒比海地区的岛屿上建立了殖民地，这些岛屿要么未被西班牙声称拥
有主权，要么从西班牙夺取。三人也试图在中美洲或南美洲建立殖民地，但西班牙和葡萄牙在那里的
统治要么使这些努力失败，就像荷兰在巴西的尝试，要么他们保持较小的殖民地，例如法属圭亚那和
荷属圭亚那，现在的苏里南。


Mercantilism also had many critics. Eighteenth-century
Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that as more gold circulated in a country’s economy,
prices would rise, eventually becoming so high that no one would purchase goods. If abundance reduced the value of an item, then the more gold and silver a nation
acquired, the less valuable it would be.

但重商主义也受到了许多批
评。十八世纪的苏格兰哲学家大卫·休谟认为，随着更多的黄金在一个国家的经济中流通，价格将会上
涨，最终变得如此之高，以至于没有人会购买商品。如果丰富性降低了一件物品的
价值，那么一个国家获得的黄金和白银越多，它的价值就越低，



The eighteenth-century philosopher and economist Adam Smith, also a Scot, criticized mercantilism
as well. Smith argued that economic gain for one nation did not mean economic loss for others.
Rather, trade could be mutually beneficial for all.

Smith also opposed government regulation of the economy. In his view,
competition among the producers of goods and the influence of the market (that is, the desires of
buyers and sellers) made for a healthy economy.

十八世纪哲学家和经济学家、苏格兰人亚当·斯密也批评重商主义。史密斯认为，一国的经济收益并不
意味着其他国家的经济损失。相反，贸易可以对所有人都有利。史密斯
还反对政府对经济的监管。在他看来，商品生产者之间的竞争和市场的影响（即买家和卖家的欲望）
有利于经济的健康发展。

Smith also argued that it made little sense for a nation to produce everything it needed.

史密斯还认为，一个国家生产其所需的一切是没有意义的。



Many Europeans argued that the assumptions underlying mercantilist theory were flawed,
and that putting it into practice was often harmful.

许多欧洲人认为，重商主义理论的假设是有缺陷的，将其付诸实践往往是有害的。



Because mercantilist theory saw economic gain for one nation as necessarily a loss for others,
European nations engaged in trade wars as each tried to use tariffs to bar others from its markets. At
times, real wars accompanied trade wars. England and the Netherlands fought four wars over the
course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, partially to gain control of transatlantic trade. England also fought France for access to the markets of India.

由于重商主义理论认为一个国家的经济收益必然会导致其他国家的损失，因此欧洲国家卷入了贸易
战，每个国家都试图利用关税来阻止其他国家进入其市场。有时，真正的战争伴随着贸易战。英国和
荷兰在 17 世纪和 18 世纪期间进行了四次战争，部分原因是为了控制跨大西洋贸易。英国
还与法国争夺印度市场的准入权。

Mercantilism affected the relationship not only between countries but also between classes. For
instance, it elevated the interests of merchants and manufacturers over those of workers and
consumers by arguing that wages should be kept low. More money would thus remain in employers’
hands, and people would be discouraged (or prevented) from buying luxury goods that could instead
be exported for profit. Mercantilists also advocated high taxes to enrich governments. The perceived
need to extract raw materials from colonies to benefit the home country’s interests often led
governments to restrict colonies’ economic growth.

重商主义不仅影响国家之间的关系，而且影响阶级之间的关系。例如，它主张应保持低工资，从而使
商人和制造商的利益高于工人和消费者的利益。因此，更多的钱将留在雇主手中，人们将被阻止（或
阻止）购买奢侈品，而这些奢侈品可以出口以获取利润。重商主义者还主张高税收来充实政府。人们
认为需要从殖民地获取原材料以造福母国的利益，这往往导致政府限制殖民地的经济增长

The nations of Europe planted
them with cash crops Europeans craved but could not produce at home. To maximize profit, they
drove workers hard without regard for their health or safety. When Indigenous peoples and European
servants could not satisfy their demands, they turned to enslaved labor taken from Africa.

欧洲国家在美洲殖民地种植了欧洲人渴望但在国内无法生产
的经济作物。为了实现利润最大化，他们不顾工人的健康或安全，拼命地驱使工人。当原住民和欧洲
仆人无法满足他们的需求时，他们转向从非洲掠夺的奴工。


One of the largest migrations in history took place between the late fifteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, as Europeans forcefully transported approximately twelve million Africans across the
Atlantic Ocean to the Americas to provide labor for Europe’s economic enterprises. Some two
million people died on the voyages across the Atlantic.


历史上最大规模的移民之一发生在 15 世纪末和 19 世纪初，当时欧洲人强行将大约 1200 万非洲人跨
大西洋运送到美洲，为欧洲的经济企业提供劳动力。大约有两百万人在横渡大西洋的航行中丧生。


The majority of Africans brought across the Atlantic were destined to labor on sugar plantations in
the Caribbean and Brazil. Many enslaved Africans were also sent to the Spanish colonies in South
America; relatively few went to the North American mainland, mostly Mexico. European colonists
had originally considered using enslaved Indigenous peoples to perform the difficult and dangerous
labor of harvesting sugar cane and other cash crops, but these efforts failed. Indigenous people died
in large numbers from infectious diseases, leaving too few to labor in the fields.

大多数跨越大西洋被带到的非洲人注定要在加勒比海和巴西的甘蔗种植园劳动。许多被奴役的非洲人
也被送往南美洲的西班牙殖民地；前往北美大陆的人相对较少，主要是墨西哥。欧洲殖民者最初考虑
利用被奴役的原住民来从事收割甘蔗和其他经济作物的艰巨而危险的劳动，但这些努力失败了。土著
人民因传染病大量死亡，只剩下很少的人在田里劳动。

For Europeans, the ideal laborers would be people as unfamiliar with the terrain as they were,
because unlike enslaved Indigenous people who knew the best places to hide, they could more
easily be recaptured if they ran away. In addition, they would be less affected by many of the
infectious diseases from which Europeans suffered.

对于欧洲人来说，理想的劳工应该是不熟悉地形的人，因为与知道最佳藏身之处的被奴役土著人不
同，如果他们逃跑，他们更容易被抓回来。此外，他们将较少受到欧洲人遭受的许多传染病的影响。

European indentured servants would also have fit the bill, but the hot Caribbean climate and
diseases like malaria and yellow fever, brought from Africa with cargoes of enslaved people, led to
high death rates among Europeans within the first year and discouraged most others from
immigrating there. Indentured servitude did not satisfy the labor needs of tobacco planters in Virginia
and Maryland either.

In addition, a French law passed in 1664 that restricted
planters’ right to beat their indentured servants made servants a less desirable form of labor in the
eyes of French colonists. Thus, Europeans eager to extract a profit looked to Africa as the solution, choosing slavery over indentured servitude, as Africans could be enslaved for a lifetime.


欧洲的契约仆人也符合这一要求，但加勒比地区炎热的气候以及从非洲通过奴隶货物带来的疟疾和黄
热病等疾病导致欧洲人在第一年内的高死亡率，并阻止了大多数其他人移民到那里。契约奴役也不能
满足弗吉尼亚州和马里兰州烟草种植者的劳动力需求. 此外，法国1664年通过
的一项法律限制种植园主殴打契约仆人的权利，这使得仆人在法国殖民者眼中成为不太理想的劳动形
式。因此，渴望获取利润的欧洲人将非洲视为解决方案，并寻求奴隶制而不是契约奴役。，而且非洲人也可以终生受奴役，

Some captains, knowing
that 10 to 20 percent would die on the voyage, packed as many people as possible into the hold.

一些船长知道 10% 到 20% 的人会在航行中丧生，因此将尽可能多的人塞进货舱

At
times crews would bring the enslaved Africans onto the deck for fresh air and make them jump and
dance to exercise their muscles, since buyers would not pay high prices for those who looked weak.
Removing captives from the hold was always a risk for the crew, however, since this was the time
when a revolt was most likely to take place.

有时，工作人员会将被奴役的非洲人带到甲板上呼吸新鲜空气，让他们跳跃和跳舞以锻炼肌肉，
因为买家不会为那些看起来很虚弱的人支付高价。然而，将俘虏从货舱中转移出来对于船员来说始终
是一个风险，因为这是最有可能发生叛乱的时间。

Taking enslaved people to the deck was also risky because many used the opportunity to
commit suicide rather than endure the misery on board ship or the uncertain fate that awaited them.
Some captains strung nets below the ships’ rails to catch those who jumped overboard.

将被奴役的人
带到甲板上也很危险，因为许多人利用这个机会自杀，而不是忍受船上的痛苦或等待着他们的不确定
的命运。一些船长在船栏杆下挂网来捕捉跳船的人。


Illness was the slave ship captains’ constant fear. The most
feared of all diseases was trachoma, an infection of the eyes that did not kill but left its victims blind.
Enslaved people who could not see would not be purchased. Even more frightening was the
possibility that the infection would spread to the crew. If the sailors lost their sight, everyone on
board faced a slow death from starvation.

疾病是奴隶船船长们一直担心的事情。所有疾病中最可怕的是沙眼，这是一种眼睛感染，不会致命，但会导致受害
者失明。看不见的奴隶不会被收买。更可怕的是，感染有可能传播到船员身上。如果水手们失明，船
上的每个人都将面临因饥饿而慢慢死亡的危险，

Slave voyages were often heavily insured against loss.

奴隶航行通常都会投保重险以防损失。



The captives purchased by European ship captains were sold by other Africans. Europeans did not
introduce slavery to Africa; it had existed there for centuries before the triangular trade began. It was
different in important ways, however, from the slavery that awaited Africans on the other side of the
Atlantic.


欧洲船长购买的俘虏被其他非洲人出售。欧洲人并没有将奴隶制引入非洲；而是欧洲人将奴隶制引入
了非洲。在三角贸易开始之前，它已经在那里存在了几个世纪。然而，它在一些重要方面与大西洋彼
岸的非洲人所面临的奴隶制有所不同。



Slavery existed in numerous African societies, and there were many ways in which a person could
become enslaved. In some societies, slavery served as punishment for a crime. In others, people
could be enslaved or sell their children into slavery to pay a debt. In times of hardship like famine,
parents might sell children to more prosperous people to earn money to support themselves and
ensure their children would be fed. In many societies, enslaved people were taken as prisoners of
war.

许多非洲社会都存在奴隶制，一个人可以通过多种方式成为奴隶。在某些社会，奴隶制是对犯罪的惩
罚。在其他情况下，人们可能会被奴役或将自己的孩子卖为奴隶以偿还债务。在饥荒等困难时期，父
母可能会将孩子卖给更富裕的人，以赚钱养活自己并确保孩子有饭吃。在许多社会中，奴隶被当作战
俘。

Those enslaved to pay a debt gained their freedom once the debt had been settled. Africans regarded slavery as an unfortunate fate that might befall anyone; being enslaved did not
imply an inherent difference or inferiority.

那些被奴役以偿还债务的人，一旦债务得到解决，
就获得了自由.非洲人认为奴隶制是一种可能降临到任何人身上的不幸
命运。被奴役并不意味着固有的差异或自卑。



Slavery in the Americas was different. It was chattel slavery, in which one person is owned by
another as a piece of property like an inanimate object. The enslaved had no status or legal rights as
persons. They could be bought, sold, inherited, or given to another. They had no right to control their
own bodies or their own labor, and they could be compelled to do whatever the slaveholder wished.
Their status could be passed on to their children; in all the European colonies in the Americas, the
child of an enslaved woman was born enslaved. Although chattel slavery also existed in Africa, this
was the only form of slavery that existed in the Americas.

美洲的奴隶制则不同。这就是动产奴隶制，一个人像无生命的物体一样被另一个人拥有作为财产。被
奴役者没有作为人的地位或合法权利。它们可以被购买、出售、继承或赠予他人。他们无权控制自己
的身体或自己的劳动，他们可能被迫做奴隶主想做的任何事。他们的地位可以传给他们的孩子；在美
洲的所有欧洲殖民地，一名被奴役的妇女的孩子生下来就是奴隶。虽然非洲也存在动产奴隶制，但这
是美洲存在的唯一形式的奴隶制。


Slave traders commonly chained their
captives together on the journey, and devices were sometimes fixed to captives’ necks so that if
they managed to escape, they would die of thirst because they could not lower their heads into
streams to drink. Once they reached the coast, the traders stripped them naked and shaved their
heads to keep them free of lice. The traders then greased their bodies with palm oil to make them
look fit and healthy when buyers came.

奴
隶贩子通常在旅途中将他们的俘虏锁在一起，有时还会在俘虏的脖子上固定一些装置，这样如果他们
成功逃脱，他们就会渴死，因为他们无法低头入溪喝水。当他们到达海岸时，商人们就把他们脱光衣
服，并剃光头以防止虱子。然后，商贩们在自己的身体上涂上棕榈油，以便在买家到来时让他们看起
来健美健康。

A number of slave trading ports flourished on the western coast of Africa from the fifteenth through
the eighteenth centuries. Among them were Ouidah (Whydah), Grand-Popo, Jaquim, and Porto-Novo
in modern Benin; Badagry in Nigeria; and Little Popo in Togo.

Some African city-states and kingdoms became wealthy from the slave
trade.

从十五世纪到十八世纪，非洲西海岸有许多奴隶贸易港口蓬勃发展。其中包括现代贝宁的维达
（Ouidah）、大波波（Grand-Popo） 、雅金（Jaquim ）和波多诺伏（Porto-Novo ）；尼日利亚的巴
达格里；和多哥的小波波。一些非洲城邦和王国通过奴隶贸易致富.


When slave
traders captured young adults, no one remained to care for children and the elderly, and fewer
people were left to reproduce. To compensate for the disappearance of so many young men, who were
the laborers most preferred by plantation owners, many African ethnic groups adopted polygyny.

当奴隶贩子俘虏年轻人时，就没有人留下来照顾儿童和老人，留下来繁
衍后代的人也更少了。为了弥补种植园主最青睐的大量年轻人的消失，许多非
洲民族实行一夫多妻制

The importation of European textiles, according to some historians, spurred the
industrialization of the European textile industry while harming African cloth producers, who could
not compete on quantity or price. Weavers continued to produce goods for local markets, but no
continent-wide market for African textiles ever had an opportunity to develop because Europeans
already dominated the field. There were similar consequences for the African metal industry.

一些历史学家认为，欧洲纺织品的
进口刺激了欧洲纺织业的工业化，同时损害了非洲布料生产商的利益，因为非洲布料生产商无法在数
量或价格上进行竞争。织布工继续为当地市场生产商品，但非洲纺织品的整个大陆市场从未有过发展
的机会，因为欧洲人已经在该领域占据主导地位。非洲金属工业也遭受了类似的后果。(一步落后，步步落后，所以科技竞争绝不能落后，否则就只能从产业链低端做起，跟中国一样，付出代价，才能慢慢向上爬)

These effects have been long-lasting. One scholar has demonstrated that the areas from which the
most enslaved people were taken are today the poorest in Africa.

Other studies have shown that people from ethnic groups most likely to
have been subject to the slave trade are less likely to trust others than are people from less affected

Most of
the crops grown by enslaved Africans in the Americas were labor intensive.

。美洲被奴役的非洲人种植的大部分农作物都是劳动密集型的。


Sugar, the most valuable crop grown by enslaved people, also required the most labor.  The labor was grueling and
dangerous. Sugar cane was densely planted, and undergrowth in the fields could hide snakes that
bit workers. After fertilizing and weeding the cane, workers harvested it by cutting it close to the
ground with machetes and then chopping it into smaller pieces to make it easier to remove from the
fields. Machetes wielded in tired workers’ sweaty hands often slashed legs and feet. Workers might
bleed to death or die when wounds became infected. People who worked too slowly were beaten.

Laborers then transported the cut cane to a mill to be crushed by heavy rollers that often caught and
mangled workers’ hands. This had to be done very quickly, within twenty-four hours of cutting the
cane, because the sap evaporated quickly. The workers boiled the crushed cane to extract a liquid
that was clarified and crystalized into sugar, a process that required hours of standing next to roaring
fires where workers were often scalded. To maximize profits, planters rotated production, so while
sugar cane was growing in one field, it was being harvested in another. Because sugar cane rapidly
depleted nutrients in the soil, laborers frequently also had to clear land for new fields.

糖是奴隶种植的最有价值的作物，也需要最多的劳动力，。这项工作既艰苦又危险。甘蔗种植很密
集，田地里的灌木丛可能隐藏着咬伤工人的蛇。给甘蔗施肥和除草后，工人们用砍刀将其靠近地面切
割，然后将其切成小块，以便更容易从田地中移走，从而收获甘蔗。疲倦的工人出汗的手上挥舞的砍
刀经常割伤腿和脚。工人可能会失血过多而死，或者因伤口感染而死亡。工作太慢的人会被殴打。
然后，工人们将切下的甘蔗运到工厂，用重型滚筒压碎，这些滚筒经常夹住并压伤工人的手。这必须
非常快地完成，在砍断甘蔗后二十四小时内完成，因为汁液蒸发得很快。工人们将压碎的甘蔗煮沸，
提取液体，然后澄清并结晶成糖，这个过程需要在熊熊大火旁站上几个小时，工人们经常被烫伤。为
了实现利润最大化，种植者轮流生产，因此，当甘蔗在一块地里种植时，它就会在另一块地里收获。
由于甘蔗会迅速耗尽土壤中的养分，劳动者还经常不得不清理土地开垦新田。


Because infant
mortality among enslaved people in the Caribbean was rampant, the enslaved population was not
self-reproducing, and slaveholders had to buy more people each year to maintain their labor force.
This differed substantially from the English North American mainland colonies where, because the
work of growing and processing tobacco was less physically grueling, enslaved people did not die in
such high numbers, and the population was able to grow through reproduction.


由于加勒比地区被奴役者的婴儿死亡率很
高，被奴役人口无法自我繁殖，奴隶主每年不得不购买更多的人口来维持劳动力。这
与英属北美大陆殖民地有很大不同，因为(北美的)种植和加工烟草的工作不那么耗费体力，被奴役的人不会死
亡如此之多，而且人口能够通过繁殖而增长。


Largely unmoved by the misery of enslaved Africans, Europeans possessed an insatiable appetite
for sugar that only grew as time passed.  As the demand for
sugar grew, so did the demand for enslaved laborers. Between 1450 and 1600, approximately 2,500
enslaved Africans a year were purchased by Europeans; in the sixteenth century, most of these
people were sent to Hispaniola, Cuba, Brazil, and Venezuela. Beginning in the seventeenth century,
however, as England, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark established sugar plantations in the
Caribbean, the number of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas rose to some 18,680 per year. In the eighteenth century, by which time thousands of sugar mills dotted the coast of
Brazil and the Caribbean islands, 61,330 people traversed the Middle Passage each year. Forty-two
percent were sent to labor in the Caribbean and 38 percent to Brazil. The British colonies of the
North American mainland claimed only 4 to 5 percent of the total.

欧洲人对被奴役的非洲人的苦难基本无动于衷，他们对糖的胃口随着时间的推移而不断增长。
随着对糖的
需求的增长，对奴役劳工的需求也在增长。 1450 年至 1600 年间，欧洲人每年购买大约 2,500 名被奴
役的非洲人；十六世纪，这些人大部分被送往伊斯帕尼奥拉岛、古巴、巴西和委内瑞拉。然而，从 17
世纪开始，随着英国、法国、荷兰和丹麦在加勒比地区建立甘蔗种植园，被带到美洲的非洲奴隶数量
每年增加到约 18,680 人。 18 世纪，巴西和加勒比海岛屿沿岸遍布着数千家糖厂，每年有
61,330 人穿越中间航道。 42% 的人被送往加勒比海地区做劳工，38% 的人被送往巴西。北美大陆的
英国殖民地仅占总数的 4% 至 5%。

糖与大西洋奴隶贸易的增长。随着欧洲对糖的需求增加，巴西和加勒比海
地区对被奴役劳工的需求也随之增加，这两个地区合计约占 18 世纪之交被带到美
洲的非洲被奴役人数的 80%。

Sugar and the Growth of the Atlantic Slave Trade. As the
European demand for sugar increased, so too did the demand for enslaved
laborers in Brazil and the Caribbean, which together would account for
approximately 80 percent of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas at the
turn of the eighteenth century.

The trade in both sugar and enslaved people sustained numerous industries and employed
thousands of people, creating great wealth for some. Shipbuilders, ship captains, and sailors found
employment, as did dock workers, freight drivers, customs agents, and workers in sugar refineries.
Bakers, pastry cooks, candy makers, and grocers all indirectly made money from sugar. People who
made the barrels that held sugar and the other products produced by enslaved people—tobacco,
rice, and indigo—profited, as did those who supplied inexpensive clothing, shoes, and foodstuffs like
salted fish for enslaved people. Banks and insurance companies earned enormous sums as well,
and those who owned large sugar plantations often invested their profits in other industries, built
magnificent mansions, or bought luxury goods.

糖和奴隶贸易维持了众多工业并雇用了数千人，为一些人创造了巨大财富。造船厂、船长和水手找到
了工作，码头工人、货运司机、报关员和糖厂工人也找到了工作。面包师、糕点师、糖果制造商和杂
货商都间接地从糖中赚钱。制造装糖和奴隶生产的其他产品（烟草、大米和靛蓝）的桶的人获利了，
那些为奴隶提供廉价衣服、鞋子和咸鱼等食品的人也获利了。银行和保险公司也赚取了巨额资金，那
些拥有大型甘蔗种植园的人经常将利润投资于其他行业，建造宏伟的豪宅，或购买奢侈品。


Such wealth was easily transformed into political power. Sugar planters in Britain successfully
lobbied Parliament to protect their interests, and many planters went into politics, holding seats in
the House of Commons and, by using their wealth to purchase titles and estates, the House of
Lords. It was thanks to the sugar lobby in Parliament that the British navy began to give its sailors a
daily ration of grog, a mixture of rum, sugar, and lime juice, increasing the profits of British sugar
planters even more.

这些财富很容易转化为政治权力。英国的糖料种植园主成功游说议会保护他们的利益，许多种植园主
进入政界，在下议院占据席位，并利用自己的财富购买头衔和地产，进入上议院。多亏了议会的糖业
游说团体，英国海军开始向水手们提供每日配给的烈酒，一种朗姆酒、糖和酸橙汁的混合物，进一步
增加了英国糖业种植者的利润。
