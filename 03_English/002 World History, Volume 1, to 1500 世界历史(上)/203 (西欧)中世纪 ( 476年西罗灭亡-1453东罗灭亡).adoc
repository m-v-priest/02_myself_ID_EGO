== 政治体制

=== ★ feudalism 封建制度

In the ashes of the Carolingian world, medieval Europe embraced a social system called feudalism.

在(法兰克)加洛林王朝的废墟中，中世纪的欧洲拥抱了一种被称为"封建主义"的社会制度.

|"领主"的权利和义务
|Lords began to grant lands to fighters as their fiefs, whose produce the warriors could enjoy so long as they served the lord.

领主开始将土地授予战士作为 他们的封地，只要战士为领主服务，他们就可以享用他们的农产品。

However, the need to placate their feudal lords ensured that kings gave away lands and privileges, often weakening them. In other cases, crushing rebellious vassals was a way of taking back needed land.

然而，为了安抚封建领主，国王们不 得不放弃土地和特权，这往往会削弱他们的实力. 在其他情况下，镇压叛乱的封臣是夺回 所需土地的一种方式。(削藩)





|"封臣"的权利和义务
|For their part, fighters became vassals of the lord, sworn to perform service in exchange for the land. This service was chiefly military in nature, but it could also include other obligations like advising the lord and attending his court when called.

就战士而言，他们成为领主的附 庸，发誓为土地服务。这项服务本质上主要是军事性的，但也可能包括其他义务，例如向领主提供建 议以及在接到命令时出席他的宫廷。


|农奴
|On their fiefs, the warriors oversaw the work of agricultural laborers. Some laborers might own their own land and be self-directed, but most in western Europe were unfree, servile laborers called serfs who were tied to the land. They were not enslaved and could not be bought or sold, but they occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder.

在(封臣)他们的封地里，战士们监督农业劳动者的工作。一些劳动者可能拥有自己的土地并且可以自我指 导，但在西欧，大多数劳动者都是不自由的奴役劳动者，被称为农奴，他们被束缚在土地上。他们不 是奴隶，不能被买卖，但他们处于社会阶梯的最底层.

Serfs owed their lord `双宾` a set number of days of service a year (these were many) and could not leave the land, marry, or undertake other work without the lord’s permission.

农奴每年要为领主服务一定天数（这些天数 很多），未经领主许可不得离开土地、结婚或从事其他工作。

|===

Bishoprics and monasteries behaved the same way; abbots and abbesses could be lords who were owed service and also owed service to greater lords.

"主教教区"和"修道院"也是如此; 修道院院长和女修道院院长, 既可以是"领主"身份，也可以为更大的领主服务。


While feudalism was not a political system, warriors owed service to lords who owed service to the king, who in theory was the largest landowner in the kingdom and the guarantor of rights and privileges.

虽然"封建制度"不是一种政治制度，但战士们要为领主服务，而领主又要为国王服务，理论上，国王是 王国最大的地主，也是权利和特权的保障者。


(到13世纪时)

Politically, thirteenth-century Europe was a series of confederations of warriors who had sworn oaths of vassalage, or loyalty, to one of the titular European kings. There were no real centralized governments, courts, or bureaucracies. The real power of kings rested on the willingness of their vassals to provide them with the support they had pledged. Most people saw their parish priest much more often than their feudal lord.

从政治上讲，十三世纪的欧洲是由一系列战士组成的联盟，他们宣誓效忠欧洲一位名义上的国王。不 存在真正的中央集权政府、法院或官僚机构。国王的真正权力取决于封臣是否愿意向他们提供他们所承诺的支持. 大多数人见到教区牧师的次数比见到封建领主的次数要多 得多。

'''


=== 君权扩大

==== (意大利) 梅尔菲宪章 (1231年)

The monarchy established secular political control through the 1231 Constitutions of Melfi, considered the oldest surviving written constitution in the world. The Constitutions of Melfi increased the power of the monarch by replacing vassals and church officials with royal bureaucrats as local administrators and judges. The bureaucracy was funded by revenue from royal monopolies on essential products like salt, iron, and copper, along with tariffs and tolls. The state created by the Constitutions of Melfi resisted church encroachment on its authority better than the Holy Roman Empire had.

君主政体通过 1231年的梅尔菲宪法（被认为是世界上现存最古老 的成文宪法）建立了世俗政治控制。梅尔菲宪法通过用皇家官僚取代封臣和教会官员担任地方行政长 官和法官，增强了君主的权力。官僚机构的资金来自皇家对盐、铁和铜等基本产品的垄断收入，以及 关税和通行费。梅尔菲宪法创建的国家比神圣罗马帝国更好地抵制了教会对其权威的侵犯。

'''

==== (法国) 官员由君主直接任命

A stronger central government also emerged in France over the thirteenth century. Royal bureaucrats replaced vassals and church officials, and the monarchy had sufficient income to pay for their loyalty.

十三世纪法国也出现了更强大的中央政府。皇家官僚取 代了封臣和教会官员，君主政体有足够的收入来支付他们的忠诚。

Beginning with King Phillip II in the late twelfth century, French monarchs exploited opportunities to add to their royal holdings by taking land from their nobles. These new lands were managed by salaried royal appointees, not vassals who could pass their holdings to heirs. By the early fourteenth century, much of France was under direct royal control, greatly enhancing the resources French kings could call upon in conflicts with their vassals and the church.

从十二世纪末的菲利普二世国王开 始，法国君主利用机会从贵族手中夺取土地来增加自己的王室财产。这些新土地由受薪的皇家任命者 管理，而不是由可以将其财产传给继承人的封臣管理。到了十四世纪初，法国的大部分地区都处于王 室的直接控制之下，这极大地增强了法国国王在与其封臣和教会发生冲突时可以动用的资源。


'''

==== 武器和战术的变革, 让贵族骑兵逐渐过时了

The first recorded use of gunpowder in battle occurred in China in 919. Western Europeans discovered recipes for gunpowder in Arabic texts brought back from the Crusades or, in the case of Spain, introduced by the Muslims who established kingdoms there from the eighth through the fifteenth centuries. By the fifteenth century, numerous European countries had begun to use gunpowder and guns in battle. By the thirteenth century, European and Ottoman armies were using early cannons called bombards to destroy the walls of cities and fortresses.

历史上第一次在战争中使用火药发生在 919 年的中国 (处于五代十国时期. 唐朝于907年灭亡. 北宋是960年才建立). 西欧人在十字军东 征带回的阿拉伯文献(情报档案)中发现了火药的配方，或者就西班牙而言，是由八世纪到十五世纪在那里建立王 国的穆斯林引入的。到了十五世纪，许多欧洲国家已经开始在战争中使用火药和枪支。到了十三世纪，欧洲和奥斯曼军队开始使用称为炮弹的早期大炮来摧毁城 市和堡垒的城墙。

In most societies, male members of the nobility, often the only ones who could afford to purchase and pay for the upkeep of horses, had formed the core of the fighting forces. Their role as society’s defenders helped to justify the exalted position their class occupied. When handheld guns became common, armed peasant infantrymen supplanted the mounted elite. The loss of their warrior role often marked the beginning of the decline in the power of the aristocracy.

在大多数社会中，男性贵族成员通常是唯一有能力购买和支付马匹保养费用的人，他们构成了战斗力 量的核心。他们作为社会捍卫者的角色有助于证明他们的阶级所占据的崇高地位是合理的。当手持枪 支变得普遍时，武装农民步兵取代了骑兵精英。他们战士角色的丧失往往标志着贵族权力衰落的开 始.

The ability to destroy fortifications helped rulers assert power both in battle and at home. Nobles found it difficult to challenge the power of rulers whose cannon could destroy their castles. Gunpowder thus helped to develop centralized states in Europe.

摧毁防御工事的能力帮助统治者在战争和国内维护权力。贵族 发现很难挑战统治者的权力，因为统治者的大炮可以摧毁他们的城堡。(君主能在军力上, 压制住了封臣贵族的军力). 因此，火药有助于欧洲中央集权国家的发展. (如同现在, 军事科技的发展, 飞机导弹, 只会有利于统治者, 而人民越来越没有能力武器, 来与统治者抗衡了.)

=== 君权受限

==== (英国)

England developed differently than other European states. The monarch’s power over its vassals and the church was limited from the thirteenth century onward, and the basic rights of commoners were protected.

英国的发展与其他欧洲国家不同。从十三世纪开始，君主对其封臣和教会的权力受到限制，平民的基 本权利受到保护。

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 规定: 君权不能削弱教会权利
|King John’s vassals compelled him in 1215 to reaffirm those rights and expand them in Magna Carta, a document that reiterated existing rights and relationships of vassals. The document confirmed the papal position that the church was above the state and “shall have its rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired... by our heirs in perpetuity.”

约翰的封臣迫使他于 1215 年在《大宪章》中重申了这些权利 并扩大了这些权利，该文件重申了封臣的现有权利和关系。该文件确认了教皇的立场，即教会凌驾于 国家之上，“其权利不应受到削弱，其自由不应受到损害……”。 。 。由我们的继承人永久继承。” +

|-> 建立陪审团
|Among the rights spelled out in Magna Carta, perhaps the most important was that “no free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals.” This requirement created a precedent for trial by jury, which remains a staple of the judicial system in the West to the present day.

在 《大宪章》规定的权利中，也许最重要的是“任何自由人不得被扣押或监禁，或被剥夺其权利或财产， 或被取缔或流放，或以任何方式被剥夺其地位，我们也不得对他使用武力，或派遣其他人这样做，除 非得到与他同等的人的合法判断。”这一要求开创了陪审团审判的先例，至今仍是西方司法制度的主要 内容。

|-> 建立议会
|The other key development leading toward centralized government with limited and specified powers was the creation of a deliberative body of nobles, clergy, and commoners that replaced the Great Council of the king’s vassals and high clergy. This new body evolved into Parliament, designed to represent the interests of the people. Membership was expanded to representatives elected by the vassals of the king’s vassals, and starting in 1265, selected towns could send representatives to speak for the interests of merchants.

导致权力有限和明确的中央集权政府的另一个关键发展是建立了一个由贵族、神职人员和平民组成的 审议机构，取代了国王封臣和高级神职人员组成的大议会。这个新机构演变为议会，旨在代表人民的 利益。成员资格扩大到由国王的封臣选出的代表，从1265年开始，选定的城镇可以派出代表为商人的 利益代言。

Parliament had two primary powers. One was to approve all tax increases.

To establish uniform rule by the monarch, as opposed to a decentralized set of laws from the nobility and a potentially conflicting set from the church, Edward I asked Parliament to also approve laws. Parliamentary approval made the laws England’s laws, not just the king’s laws. Even if the king had drafted them, the nobles, clergy, and wealthy commoners had to agree to them.

议会有两项主要权力。一是批准所有增税。

为了建立君主的统一统治，而不是贵族制定分散的法律和 教会制定可能相互冲突的法律，爱德华一世要求议会也批准法律。议会的批准使这些法律成为英格兰 的法律，而不仅仅是国王的法律。即使是国王起草的，贵族、神职人员和富有的平民也必须同意。

== 经济

Although cities on the coast often maintained commercial or networking ties with each other, society in western Europe was overwhelmingly rural, and production was largely at the subsistence level.

People produced what they were going to consume, and surplus went to the lord or the church as a mandatory tax, usually 10 percent, called the tithe.

尽管沿海城市经常相互保持商业或网络联系，但西欧社会绝大多数是农村，生产主要处于自给自足的水平。人们生产他们要消费的东西，剩余的东西作为"强制税", 交给领主或教会，通常是 10%，称为"什一税"。


'''

== 宗教

=== 教皇 Gregory 派 Augustine 去英国传教

Pope Gregory (also known as Gregory the Great) commissioned monks from Italy, led by Augustine of Canterbury, to convert the Anglo-Saxons. (Monks are men who do not marry, often live in community with each other, and devote their lives to serving God. Their female counterparts are called nuns.)

教皇格列 高利（也称为格列高利大帝）委托坎特伯雷的奥古斯丁领导的来自意大利的僧侣去改变盎格鲁撒克逊 人的信仰。 （僧侣是不结婚的男性，经常集体生活，一生致力于侍奉上帝。她们的女性同行被称为修 女。）

By the time of the Middle Ages, five ancient seats of Christianity were recognized as the most prestigious: Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople. Each was led by a bishop with the honorary title of “patriarch.”  +
In the tenth century, only Rome and Constantinople were in territory not controlled by Muslims.

到 了中世纪，五个古老的基督教圣地被认为是最有声望的：耶路撒冷、安条克城、亚历山大城、罗马城, 和君士坦丁堡。每个人都由一位享有“族长”荣誉称号的主教领导。 +
十世纪时，只有罗马和君士坦丁堡两城, 处于非穆斯林控制的地区。


'''

=== 教会从领主手中, 获得独立权

The chaotic aftermath of the collapse of the Carolingian Empire led to a complicated situation between secular rulers and the Christian Church. According to German law, lords had the right to control everything on their land, including churches and monasteries. This control even extended to the appointment of officeholders to church positions such as abbot or bishop. To ensure they had the loyalty of church officials, lords staffed these offices with their family members or even sold them to the highest bidder. The consequence was that those without religious vocations, or even familiarity with Christian doctrine, could be installed into church leadership. Even the position of the pope, the bishop of Rome, could come up for sale.

(法兰克)加洛林帝国崩溃后的混乱, 导致世俗统治者和基督教会之间的复杂局面。根据德国法律，领主有权控制 其土地上的一切，包括教堂和修道院。这种控制甚至延伸到任命官员担任教会职务，例如方丈或主 教。为了确保教会官员的忠诚，领主们在这些办公室里配备了他们的家人，甚至将它们卖给出价最高 的人。结果是，那些没有宗教职业，甚至不熟悉基督教教义的人，可以被任命为教会领导层。甚至罗 马教皇、罗马主教的职位也可能被出售。(买官卖官)

Revulsion at this treatment of religious office led to a reform movement intended to remove the influence of secular lords from the management of the church. The movement is often associated with the monastery of Cluny in France, which managed to get independence from the local aristocrat.
The Cluniac movement eventually drew in other clergy who wanted the church to control the election of bishops, independent of secular influence.

对宗教职务这种待遇的反感引发了一场改革运动，旨在消除世俗领主对教会管理的影响。该运动通常 与法国克鲁尼修道院联系在一起，该修道院成功地从当地贵族手中获得了独立。克吕尼 运动最终吸引了其他神职人员，他们希望教会能够独立于世俗影响来控制主教的选举。

罗马主教最终受到克吕尼运动的影响，改革教会。

The bishops of Rome were eventually influenced by the Cluniac movement to reform the church.

|-> 解决"买卖官职"的问题
|They condemned the sale of offices as a sin called simony and insisted that bishops should be elected by clergy, independent of a lord. Any clergy member who had bought an office or had it bought for them could be removed.

他们谴责出售官职是一种被称为买卖圣职的罪孽， 并坚持认为主教应该由神职人员选举产生，独立于领主。任何购买办公室或为他们购买办公室的神职 人员都可以被解雇。

|-> 解决教会体制内"父传子"的问题
|To end the practice of treating church positions like a fief to be passed on to the officeholder’s children, priests were told to practice celibacy and were forbidden to marry.

为了结束将教会职位视为封地传给官员子女的做法，牧师被告知要独身，并禁止 结婚。

|-> 如何区分"战争合法性"问题
|The reformers were also interested in creating a thoroughly Christianized society by distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate warfare. The church argued that Christian soldiers, especially knights, should obey a code of conduct that reflected the church’s values. For example,

- they should not loot monasteries or hold clergy for ransom.
- They should protect the church as well as women and the defenseless.
- They should observe periods of publicly declared truces and not fight on religiously significant days like Easter.

These principles contributed to the ideals of chivalry.

改革者还希望通过区分合法战争和非法战争, 来创建一个彻底基督教化的社会。教会认为基督教士兵， 尤其是骑士，应该遵守反映教会价值观的行为准则。例如，

- 他们不应该抢劫修道院或扣留神职人员勒 索赎金。
- 他们应该保护教会以及妇女和手无寸铁的人。
- 他们应该遵守公开宣布的休战期，不要在复活 节等具有宗教意义的日子里打架。

这些原则促成了骑士精神的理想.
|===

The church declared that a king who tried to appoint a bishop or asked for a bribe could be excommunicated (placed outside the church, its communion, and the sacraments, in hopes of reforming the offender). Excommunication could threaten the king’s position and lead to rebellions.

教会宣布，试图任命主教, 或要求贿赂的国王, 可以被逐出教会(被排除在教会、圣餐, 和圣礼之外，希望能改造罪犯)。 被逐出教会, 可能会威胁到国王的地位, 并引发叛乱。

The reform movement gained the church some moral prestige, but the growing power of the pope also worsened the relationship between the eastern and western halves of the faith.

改革运动为教会赢得了一定的道德威望，但教皇权力的不断增长, 也恶化了东西方(即西欧和东罗马帝国)信仰之间的关系。

In 1054, the pope sent representatives to the patriarch of Constantinople to discuss the differences between the two halves of the church. The pope’s chief representative felt the patriarch was not cooperating with or even recognizing the embassy, so he issued a letter excommunicating the patriarch and his followers. Soon after, the patriarch issued his own letter excommunicating the pope’s representatives. Following this Great Schism of 1054, the eastern church became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the western half the Catholic Church.

1054年，教皇派代表到君士坦丁堡的宗主教那里，讨论教会两部分之间的差异。教皇的首席代表认为，这位宗主教不与大使馆合作，甚至不承认大使馆，因此他发出了一封信函，将这位宗主教及其追随者逐出教会。不久之后，这位宗主教发表了自己的信，将教皇的代表逐出教会。在1054年的大分裂之后，东方教会被称为东正教，而西半部则被称为天主教。

== 西欧中世纪发展与灭亡框架


Western Afro-Eurasia faced a number of challenges in the early Middle Ages, the period from about 500 to 1000 CE. With the collapse of Roman authority came a time of political instability and insecurity. Cities declined, and institutions of learning weakened. Western Europe became increasingly rural. Because there was no longer a strong centralized state to develop and police the roads, travel became more difficult and more dangerous, harming commerce.

西非-欧亚大陆在中世纪早期（大约公元 500 年至 1000 年）面临着许多挑战。随着罗马权威的崩溃， 政治不稳定和不安全的时期到来了。城市衰落，学习机构衰弱。西欧变得越来越乡村化。由于不再有 一个强大的中央集权国家来开发和监管道路，旅行变得更加困难和危险，损害了商业。

=== the Franks 法兰克王国

|-> 墨洛温王朝
|The most successful Germanic kingdom was that of the Franks. Clovis I, a member of the Merovingian dynasty, founded the kingdom in the early sixth century.

最成功的日耳曼王国是法兰克王国。墨洛温王朝成员克洛维一世(法兰克王国奠基人)于六世纪初建立了该王国.

A chief source of conflict was the practice of partible inheritance, whereby each son received an equal share of his father’s estate. Estates thus became smaller with each successive generation unless new lands were conquered, often by being taken from siblings, in-laws, or cousins. Kings without land and resources to offer as reward lost the ability to attract fighters.

Real power lay with the aristocrats, and eventually a new dynasty called the Carolingians took control of the Frankish kingdom.

随着时间的推移，墨洛温王朝的统治者陷入了暴力的内讧. 冲突的一个主要根源是分割继承的做法，即每个儿子均分其父亲的遗产。因此，每一代人 的庄园都会变得越来越小，除非征服了新的土地，通常是从兄弟姐妹、姻亲或表兄弟那里夺取的。没 有土地和资源作为奖励的国王就失去了吸引战士的能力。

真正的权力掌握在贵族手中，最终一个名为 加洛林王朝的新王朝, 控制了法兰克王国。

|-> 加洛林王朝
|With the support of the pope, Pépin le Bref (Pippin the Short) became the first Carolingian king of the Franks, deposing his Merovingian rival. In return, he confirmed a grant of lands in Italy to the pope. This grant, known as the Donation of Pepin, provided the legal basis for the establishment of the Papal States and helped ensure that the papacy, the set of administrative structures associated with the government of the Catholic Church, was not just a religious institution but also a territorial power.

Their alliance with the popes allowed the Carolingian rulers to work independently of the Byzantine Empire.

在教皇的支持下，皮平(矮子"丕平")成为第一位"加洛林王朝"的法兰克国王，废黜了他的"墨洛温王朝"对手。作为回报，他确认将意大利的土地, 授予教皇。这项被称为"佩平捐赠"的拨款，为"教皇国"的建立提供了法律基础，并有助于确保教皇这一与"天主教会"政府相关的行政机构，不仅是一个宗教机构，而且海拥有领土权力。

他们与教皇的联盟, 使得"加洛林王朝"的统治者, 能够独立于"拜占庭帝国"运作。

|-> 查理曼帝国
|
Pépin’s son Charles, known as Charlemagne (“Charles the Great”), was the most influential ruler in the early European Middle Ages. He campaigned nearly every year of his reign, uniting western Europe for the first time since the collapse of Roman authority.

On Christmas Day in the year 800, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III. This coronation angered Byzantine rulers and set the stage for conflict between east and west in their quest for prestige and territory.

丕平的儿子查理，被称为查理曼大帝（“查理大帝”），是欧洲中世纪早期最有影响力的统治者. 他在位期间, 几乎每年都征战，自罗马权威崩溃以来, 首次统一了西欧。

800年圣诞节，查理曼大帝被教皇利奥三世, 加冕为罗马皇帝。这次加冕礼激怒了"拜占庭"统治者，并为东西方之间争夺威望和领土的冲突, 埋下了伏笔。

Charlemagne’s empire did not last. These internal problems were worsened by external ones, especially new invaders emboldened by the collapse of Carolingian strength. From the east came nomadic raiders, the Magyars, a non- Germanic people who migrated from the steppes of central Asia. At the end of the ninth century, they settled in what is today Hungary, and from there they launched devastating raids for plunder into Germany.

查理曼的帝国并没有持续多久。 这些内部问题, 因外部问题而变得更加严重，尤其是由于"加洛林王朝"实力崩溃而引来了胆大妄为的新入侵者。 来自东方的游牧掠夺者马扎尔人, 是从中亚草原迁徙而来的非日耳曼民族。九世纪末，他们定居在今天的匈牙利，并从那里对德国发起毁灭性的掠夺。

=== the Vikings 维京人


Perhaps more famous today than the Magyars and Islamic raiders were the Norse who raided northern Europe from Scandinavia, called the Vikings. The peoples of Scandinavia, who spoke Germanic languages, had a culture similar to that of the Germanic peoples who settled in the Roman Empire.

今天，也许比"马扎尔人"和"伊斯兰袭击者"更出名的, 是从"斯堪的纳维亚半岛"袭击北欧的挪威人，即"维京人"。斯堪的纳维亚半岛的人民, 讲日耳曼语言，其文化与定居在罗马帝国的日耳曼人民相似。


The growth of the population in the eighth century and the relative lack of arable land in Scandinavia compelled groups of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes to travel in search of plunder.

Some made trading connections along the Dnieper River, establishing settlements at Kiev that eventually became one of the first Russian states. They reached Constantinople, and some served as the personal bodyguard to the Byzantine ruler. These Vikings were known as Varangians, and they settled in eastern Europe.

Although violent, they were also traders, interested in paving the way for new settlements and connections beyond western Europe.

八世纪人口的增长, 和"斯堪的纳维亚半岛"耕地的相对缺乏, 迫使丹麦人、挪威人和瑞典人, 向外部世界寻找掠夺品。(他们中)有些人沿着第聂伯河建立贸易联系，在基辅建立定居点，最终成 为俄罗斯最早的国家之一。他们到达君士坦丁堡，其中一些人担任拜占庭统治者的私人保镖。这些维 京人被称为瓦兰吉人，他们定居在东欧。

尽管他们很暴力，但他们也是商人，有兴趣为新的定居点, 和西欧以外的联系, 铺平道路。

In the west, the arrival of the Norse raiders was less benign. The sudden nature of the violent raids, and the inability of Frankish or Anglo-Saxon armies to defeat them, instilled fear in the population of western Europe.

但在西方，挪威入侵者的到来就不那么友好了。他们暴力袭击的突然性，以及法兰克或盎格鲁撒克逊军队无力击败他们，给西欧人民带来了恐惧。


Eventually, the Norse raiders began to settle in regions rather than just raid them.

- In 865, a substantial army of Vikings invaded Britain and destroyed most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except for Wessex.
- In 911, they settled in northern France, establishing the duchy of Normandy.
- By the end of the tenth century, Vikings had also established settlements throughout the British Isles, including Ireland and Scotland, farther west in Iceland and Greenland, and even (though briefly) in North America.

Not just raiders, they promoted trade throughout northern Europe and beyond, extending their trading routes to the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate.

Like the earlier Germanic peoples, they eventually converted to Roman Christianity, and their kings began to build more centralized kingdoms that enabled them to curb the violence of the raiders.

最终，挪威掠夺者开始在一些地区定居，而不仅仅是袭击它们。 865年，维京人大军入侵不列颠，摧毁 了除威塞克斯以外的大部分盎格鲁撒克逊王国。 911年，他们在法国北部定居，建立诺曼底公国。到十 世纪末，维京人还在不列颠群岛各地建立了定居点，包括爱尔兰和苏格兰，更西边的冰岛和格陵兰岛，甚至（尽管短暂）北美。

他们不仅是掠夺者，还促进整个北欧及其他地区的贸易，将贸易路线延 伸至拜占庭帝国和阿巴斯哈里发国。

像早期的日耳曼民族一样，他们最终皈依了罗马基督教，他们的 国王开始建立更加中央集权的王国，使他们能够遏制入侵者的暴力。

=== 夺取耶路撒冷, 建立十字军国家 (第1次十字军东征)

In 1095, facing invasion on all sides, the Byzantine ruler Alexios I sent ambassadors to plead for help from the pope and an opportunity for a reconciliation between the two churches. Urban answered the Byzantine emperor’s call for aid.

1095年，面对四面楚歌的入侵，拜占庭统治者阿莱克修斯一世派遣大使向罗马教皇请求帮助，并为两个教会提供了和解的机会。(东西两个教会已经在1054年时大分裂了). (罗马教皇)乌尔班回应了拜占庭皇帝的援助呼吁.

Pope Urban II was a supporter of church reform, and that put him at odds with German emperors like Henry IV, who insisted on his own right to appoint bishops, even the bishop of Rome.

教皇乌尔班二世是"教会改革"的支持者(即他支持教会独立与王权)，这使他与亨利四世等德国国王产生了分歧，(国王)亨利四世坚持自己能任命主教的权利，甚至是任命罗马主教。

Urban II presented his idea of religious war in response to the Byzantine request for aid at a council in Clermont, France, in 1095. While the council was ostensibly about reform, Urban also issued a call for Christians from all walks of life to undertake an “armed pilgrimage” to liberate the Christian Holy Land (the lands of the eastern Mediterranean associated with the life of Jesus and the biblical prophets, including Jerusalem) from “Turkic” control. Urban’s goal at this point was to free the Holy Land from non-Christian rulers in defense of the Christians living there; it was not a blanket endorsement of violence against Muslims. These limitations were later eased, however, as the popes discovered the power of calling repeated crusades to promote the reforming goals of the church and to compete with political rivals in Europe, like the German emperors.

1095 年，乌尔班二世在法国克莱蒙的一次会议上提出了他的宗教战争想法，以回应拜占庭的援助请 求。虽然该会议表面上是在讨论改革，但乌尔班二世也呼吁各行各业的基督徒开展一项改革。 “武装朝 圣”，旨在将基督教圣地（与耶稣和圣经先知的生活有关的东地中海土地，包括耶路撒冷）从“突厥”控 制下解放出来。乌尔班此时的目标是将圣地从非基督教统治者手中解放出来，以保卫居住在那里的基 督徒。这并不是全面支持针对穆斯林的暴力行为。然而，这些限制后来得到了缓解，因为教皇发现了号召反复十字军东征具有这种力量: 能促进教会改革, 并与德国皇帝等欧洲政治对手竞争.

The popes had no armies, and they often had to depend on the unreliable aristocracy for protection when disagreements over church policy resulted in armed conflict with the princes of Europe. If they were to maintain their control over the church in contests with kings and emperors, it would be useful to see what happened when a pope rallied common Christians to a religious cause as a test of faith.

教皇没有军队，当教会政策上的分歧导致与欧洲诸侯的武装冲突时，他们往往不得不依靠不可靠的贵族来保护。如果他们想在与国王和皇帝的竞争中, 保持自己对教会的控制，那么看看当教皇将普通基督徒召集到宗教事业上以考验信仰时会发生什么，将会很有用。

We do not have an exact copy of Urban’s speech in Clermont that launched the First Crusade, but others grafted their own ideas onto what they had heard, what others said they had heard, or what some people thought Urban should have said.

我们没有乌尔班在克莱蒙发动第一次十字军东征的演讲的精确副本，但其他人将自己的想法 移植到他们所听到的、其他人说他们听到的或一些人认为乌尔班应该说的话上。

|参加十字军的人的目的:
|- Some may have hoped to gain land if they remained in the Holy Land,
- and others were motivated simply to see the earthly Jerusalem as a way of experiencing the heavenly Jerusalem that awaited them when they died, and then returned home.

人们参加十字军的目的:

- 有些人可能希望如果留在圣地，就 能获得土地，
- 而另一些人的动机只是为了将地上的耶路撒冷视为一种体验天上耶路撒冷的方式，天上 的耶路撒冷在他们死后等待着他们，然后返回家园。

Many crusaders' expectation was that they would return home, and many pilgrims and crusaders did so rather than settling in the Holy Land.

(在建立了十字军国家之后,) 许多十字军战士的期望往往是返回家园，而许多朝圣者和十字军战士都这样做了, 而不是在圣地定居。

|十字军本身的目标:
|The earlier notion of crusade expanded to include Muslim kingdoms in Spain or elsewhere, non-Christian settlements in Europe, and even the domains of the pope’s political enemies in Europe.

早期十字军东征的概念扩大到包括西班牙或其他地方的穆斯林王国、欧洲的非基 督教定居点，甚至欧洲教皇政敌的领地。

The crusading ideal was also transformed by practice and experience. The popes now called holy wars not just to liberate Jerusalem but to fight against the enemies of the church. Crusades were called against non-Christians in the Baltic regions, against heretics in France, and even against the pope’s personal enemies in Italy.

(在以后的所有n次十字军行动失败后, 最后,) 十字军理想也因实践和经验而改变。教皇现在称圣战不仅是为了解放耶路撒冷，也是为了对抗教会的敌人。十字军东征的目标是波罗的海地区的非基督徒，法国的异端，甚至意大利的教皇的私人敌人 。

Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the crusading ideal declined in popularity. This was due in part to the decline of the power of the papacy and in part to the revival of royal power in the fourteenth century. The Crusades had been launched by popular popes. Over time, they came to seem more concerned about their own power and prestige and less like the hard-working clerics who had battled kings for the freedom of the church.

中世纪末期，十字军理想不再受欢迎。这部分是由于教皇权力的衰落，部分是由于十四世纪王权的复 兴。十字军东征是由教皇发动的。随着时间的推移，他们似乎越 来越关心自己的权力和威望，不再像那些为教会自由而与国王作战的辛勤工作的神职人员。

While the Byzantine emperor wanted aid for his realm, Urban instead sent the crusaders to Jerusalem.

当拜占庭皇帝希望为他的王国提供援助时，乌尔班却将十字军派往耶路撒冷。

|第一次十字军行动, 隐士"彼得"一方的结果:
|
The Crusades were rarely well organized, however. During the First Crusade, the followers of Peter the Hermit arrived in Constantinople first. They did not wait for other groups to arrive and were ferried over to Anatolia (the Asian part of today’s Turkey) by Alexios, the Byzantine ruler. The Turks destroyed this army, and very few survived to return to Constantinople.

Later crusaders understood that gathering intelligence in Constantinople was crucial to avoiding Peter’s fate.


然而，十字军东征很少组织得很好. 第一次十字军东征期间，隐士彼得的追随者首先到达君士坦丁堡。他们没有等 待其他团体到达，就被拜占庭统治者阿莱克修斯运送到安纳托利亚（今天土耳其的亚洲部分）。土耳 其人摧毁了这支军队，很少有人幸存返回君士坦丁堡。 +
后来的十字军明白，在君士坦丁堡收集情报对 于避免彼得的命运至关重要。

|第一次十字军行动, 贵族军队一方的结果:
|The bulk of the First Crusade was directed by powerful aristocrats whose armies were better organized than Peter’s, even if most of its participants were not the most senior nobles of Western society. Alexios promised them aid in exchange for the return of Byzantine territory held by Muslims, which most initially agreed to.  ... straining the relationships between the crusaders and the Byzantine Empire.

第一次十字军东征的大部分由强大的贵族指挥，他们的军队比彼得的军队组织得更好，尽管大多数参与者并不是西方社会最高级的贵族。阿莱克修斯(拜占庭第二任皇帝)向他们承诺提供援助，条件是换取他们归还被穆斯林占领的拜占庭领土，大多数人最初都同意了。(但他们事后又没兑现承诺,) 这使得十字军与拜占庭帝国之间的关系变得紧张。
|===


The crusading armies then took other important cities in the area, and to secure their control they established the four Crusader States: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. These Crusader States were also called Outremer (literally “overseas”) by the French.

(1099年占领耶路撒冷后,) 随后十字军占领了该地区的其他重要城市，为了确保控制 权，他们建立了四个十字军国家：埃德萨郡、安条克公国、的黎波里郡和耶路撒冷王国。这些十字军 国家也被法国人称为Outremer （字面意思是“海外”）.

image:/img/0023.jpg[,80%]

The crusaders organized their government in feudal terms, but the native populations never became serfs owing service to their lords. Instead, they paid their taxes in cash or in goods.

十字军以"封建"形式组织了政府，但当地居民从未因为领主服务而成为农奴。相反，他们以现金或货物缴纳税款。



The lack of settlers from Europe ensured that the number of soldiers in Outremer was small. This was why the crusaders built imposing fortresses and castles, like the famous Krak des Chevaliers in Syria.

由于缺乏来自欧洲的定居者，海外地区的士兵数量很少。这就是为什么十字军建造了气势磅礴的堡垒和城堡，比如叙利亚著名的骑士堡.


早期十字军东征的路线。第一次至第四次十字军东征都面临着后勤和其他方面的挑战，并取得了不同程度的成功。

=== 萨拉丁夺取耶路撒冷 (第2次十字军东征时)

The Muslims adapted quickly, however. A Turkic aristocrat named Imad al-Din Zengi managed to take the city of Edessa, in the northernmost of the Crusader States. The loss of Edessa posed a serious threat to the remaining Crusader States, however, and prompted the pope to call the Second Crusade.

然而，穆斯林很快就适应了，一位名 叫伊马德·丁·曾吉（Imad al-Din Zengi）的突厥贵族成功占领了位于十字军国家最北 端的埃德萨市。埃德萨的 丧失对剩余的十字军国家构成了严重威胁，并促使教皇召开了第二次十字军东征。


The Second Crusade, from 1147 to 1149, was heralded by a new generation of preachers like Bernard of Clairvaux. Bernard also wrote the rules for the Knights Templar, one of the new crusading orders, religious orders of monks devoted to protecting Christian pilgrims and fighting to support Outremer.

This crusade was led by powerful rulers, including King Louis VII of France and King Conrad III of Germany. The armies of the Second Crusade were defeated in Anatolia in separate battles, and few soldiers reached the Holy Land. The kings accomplished very little, and many blamed the Byzantine emperor, who had learned to be distrustful of European armies.

1147 年至 1149 年的第二次十字军东征是由克莱尔沃的伯纳德 (Bernard of Clairvaux)等新一代传教士 发起的。伯纳德还为圣殿骑士团制定了规则，圣殿骑士团是新的十字军骑士 团之一，是致力于保护基督教朝圣者并为支持海外领土而战的僧侣宗教团体。

( In the early fourteenth century, the king of France accused the Knights Templar, one of the more popular crusading orders, of committing crimes such as blasphemy and apostasy (the rejection of Christianity). The order’s leaders were executed as heretics, and the popes disbanded the order, largely to please the French king.

("圣殿骑士团"以后的最终结局:) 十四世纪 初，法国国王指控圣殿骑士团（较受欢迎的十字军骑士团之一）犯有亵渎和叛教（拒绝基督教）等罪 行。该骑士团的领导人被作为异端分子处决，教皇解散了该骑士团，主要是为了取悦法国国王。)

这次十字军东征是由强 大的统治者领导的，其中包括法国国王路易七世和德国国王康拉德三世。第二次十字军东 征的军队在安纳托利亚的多次战斗中被击败，很少有士兵到达圣地。国王们几乎没有取得什么成就， 许多人指责拜占庭皇帝，因为他已经学会了对欧洲军队的不信任。

After this loss, the situation for Outremer only became more dire. Imad al-Din Zengi’s successors were well liked, even by crusaders, and they strove to unite the Muslim princes in jihad. The most famous of these successors was Salah al-Din, or Saladin in the Christian world. He was known for being humane, fair-minded, and, in Christians terms, chivalrous. In 1187, after years of gathering allies and eroding the military power of Outremer, he destroyed the crusaders at the Battle of the Horns of Hattin (in today’s Israel). Within months, Jerusalem fell to Saladin.

这次失利之后，Outremer的处境变得更加严峻。(伊斯兰的)伊马德·丁·赞吉的继任者很受欢迎，甚至受到十字军的 喜爱，他们努力团结穆斯林王子进行圣战。这些继任者中最著名的是萨拉丁（Salah al-Din），即基督 教世界的萨拉丁。他以仁慈、公正、用基督徒的话来说，具有侠义精神而闻名. 1187 年，经过多年聚集盟友并削弱海外的军事力量，他在哈丁角战役（位 于今天的以色列）消灭了十字军。几个月之内，耶路撒冷落入萨拉丁之手。

The Christians’ response was the Third Crusade (1189–1192).

基督徒的回应是第三次十字军东征（1189-1192）。

'''

=== 十字军东征 (第3次)


This crusade was prompted both by the fear that Outremer was about to be wiped off the map and by the desire to retake Jerusalem. Kings from England, the Holy Roman Empire, and France as well as other powerful princes answered the call. When they arrived in the last remaining Christian outposts in the Middle East, they quickly fell to squabbling with each other and the aristocracy of Outremer. As a result, the Christians were able to conquer the island of Cyprus and the coastline of the Holy Land but were unable to move farther inland.

这次十字军东征的动机既有对海外领土即将从地图 上消失的恐惧，也有夺回耶路撒冷的愿望。来自英格兰、神圣罗马帝国和法国的国王以及其他强大的 王子响应了这一号召。当他们到达中东仅存的基督教前哨基地时，他们很快就陷入了彼此之间以及海 外贵族的争吵之中。结果，基督徒能够征服塞浦路斯岛和圣地的海岸线，但无法进一步向内陆移动。

Eventually, Richard I of England, known in popular stories as Richard the Lionhearted, negotiated a treaty with Saladin that left Jerusalem under Muslim control but allowed Christian pilgrims to freely visit the city. Both Saladin and Richard were praised as examples of chivalric virtue in Europe and heroes of their respective religions. But this was one of the last successes the crusaders were to have in the Holy Land.


最终，英国的理查一世（在流行故事中被称为狮心王理查）与萨拉丁谈判达成一项条约，将耶路撒冷 置于穆斯林控制之下，但允许基督教朝圣者自由访问这座城市。萨拉丁和理查都被誉为欧洲骑士美德 的典范和各自宗教的英雄。但这是十字军在圣地取得的最后胜利之一。


The crusading movement continued after the Third Crusade, but enthusiasm waned.

第三次十字军东征后，十字军运动仍在继续，但热情减退。

'''

=== 十字军干涉东罗马帝国政治, 东西方关系再次恶化

Pope Innocent III, one of the most powerful medieval popes, called for a new crusade in 1202. The crusaders wanted to avoid the overland routes through Anatolia that had been a problem from the start. They hoped to avoid the Byzantine Empire too, because tensions between crusader leaders and the Byzantine emperors had been worsened by religious conflict and accusations of betrayal.

中世纪最有权势的教皇之一教皇英诺森三 世于 1202 年呼吁发动新的十字军东征。十字军希望避开穿越安纳托利亚的陆路路线，这从一开始就是 一个问题。他们也希望避开拜占庭帝国，因为宗教冲突和背叛指控加剧了十字军领袖和拜占庭皇帝之 间的紧张关系。

The crusaders continued to Constantinople, where they became involved in the internal politics of the Byzantine Empire and attacked the city, sacking it. While the Catholics established the short-lived Latin Empire of Constantinople, considerable damage had been done to the crusading movement and to relations between the Greek Orthodox and Catholic churches.

十字军继续前往君士坦丁堡，在那里他们参与了拜占庭帝国的内部政治，并袭击了这座城市，将其洗劫一空，试图让亲十字军的皇帝登上王位。虽然天主教徒建立了 短命的君士坦丁堡拉丁帝国，但十字军运动以及希腊东正教和天主教会之间的关系受到了相当大的损 害。

'''

=== 法国主导十字军

Later calls for crusades were met with some enthusiasm, but the object of the fight became Egypt, recognized as an important base for controlling the Holy Land. Nevertheless, later crusades became increasingly French and less successful at accomplishing their goals. The French crusader-king Louis IX led the Seventh and Eighth Crusades against Muslim rulers in North Africa and died of illness there. (He was later canonized as St. Louis.)

后来十字军东征的呼声得到了一些热情，但战斗的对象却变成了埃及，被认为是控制圣地的重要基 地。然而，后来的十字军东征越来越法国化，并且在实现其目标方面不太成功。法国十字军国王路易九世领导了第七次和第八次十字军东征，对抗北非的穆 斯林统治者，并在那里病逝。 （他后来被封为圣路易斯。）

When the port city of Acre in present-day Israel fell in 1291, the last of the Crusader States fell with it.

1291 年，当今天以色列的港口城市阿卡陷 落时，最后一个十字军国家也随之陷落。

=== 动荡的14世纪

The Fourteenth Century Begins. This map depicts the patchwork of kingdoms and political entities in Europe and beyond at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The many divisions ensured that political fragmentation rather than centralization defined the region throughout the medieval period, and many states depicted here still lacked a strong, centralized rule entirely.

十四世纪开始。这张地图描绘了十四世纪初欧洲及其他地区的王国和政治实体的拼凑而成。在整个中世纪时期，许多分裂确保了 该地区的政治分裂而不是集权，并且这里描绘的许多国家仍然完全缺乏强大的集权统治。

The fourteenth century was generally an era of chronic conflict and instability for most of the continent.

对于欧洲大陆的大部分地区 来说，14世纪总体上是一个长期冲突和不稳定的时代

In contrast to the stability that had defined much of the thirteenth century for the European Christian Church, it began experiencing significant destabilization in the beginning of the fourteenth century, when tensions between the pope and national monarchs led to a weakening of papal authority and division within the church.

与欧洲基督教会在 13 世纪的大部分时间里保持稳定相反，它在 14 世纪初开始经历严重的不稳定，当 时教皇和国家君主之间的紧张关系导致教皇权威的削弱和教会内部的分裂。

=== Little Ice Age 小冰期

Long-term weather fluctuations, during which periods of relative warmth and cold alternated over hundreds of years, have long been part of Earth’s ecological landscape and the narrative of environmental history.

长期 的天气波动，即相对温暖和寒冷的时期交替长达数百年，长期以来一直是地球生态景观和环境历史叙 述的一部分。

Even subtle shifts in climate and temperature have historically resulted in widespread demographic and ecological transformations. In an era during which many people survived on subsistence agriculture, even the slightest change in seasonal weather patterns could devastate crops and result in widespread malnourishment and starvation.

历史上，即使是 气候和温度的微妙变化也会导致广泛的人口和生态变化. 在一个许多人靠自给农业生存的时代，即使季节性天气模式发生最轻微的变 化也可能毁坏农作物并导致广泛的营养不良和饥饿。

Perhaps the greatest challenge in grasping the impact of climate change on the past is the limitations of traditional historical sources. Texts and other written source materials often provide scant information about environmental fluctuations of earlier centuries.

也许理解气候变化对过去的影响的最大挑战是传统历史资料的局限性。文本和其他书面来源材料通常 提供的有关早期几个世纪环境波动的信息很少。

- Historians study references to crop yields and weather fluctuations in weather journals and tax records, along with scientific data drawn from tree rings and organic material trapped beneath ice sheets in different parts of the world, which offer information about past temperature fluctuations and rainfall patterns.

历史学家 研究天气期刊和税务记录中有关农作物产量和天气波动的参考文献，以及从世界各地冰盖下的树木年 轮和有机物质中提取的科学数据，这些数据提供了有关过去温度波动和降雨模式的信息.

- Because trees can live for hundreds or even thousands of years, during which they experience a variety of environmental fluctuations, clues about these changing conditions are often hidden within the rings in their stumps. The color and width of tree rings can provide snapshots of past climate conditions.

由于树木可以存活数百年甚至数千年， 在此期间它们会经历各种环境波动，因 此有关这些变化条件的线索通常隐藏在 树桩的年轮中. 树木年轮 的颜色和宽度可以提供过去气候条件的 快照.

This chart depicts the shift in the Northern Hemisphere’s temperature over the last millennium, including the Medieval Warm Period that began in the tenth century and the Little Ice Age that ran from the fourteenth century to approximately 1850.

这张图表描绘了北半球近千年来的气温变化，包括从10世纪开始的中世纪温暖期和从14世纪到1850年左右的小冰 期。

image:/img/0029.jpg[,100%]

There had been a global temperature decrease of 0.6°C, with some areas experiencing as much as a two-degree drop in annual temperature. As more water turned to ice, less was available to evaporate and turn into rain. Despite their global impact, the effects of the Little Ice Age were not the same everywhere.

- In the Mediterranean and West Africa, irregular rainfall and periods of drought dramatically reduced crop yields,
- whereas in China and northern Europe, cold weather and the freezing of lakes and rivers were especially pronounced.
- Elsewhere in Europe and Asia, in 1314, extraordinary rains began to fall that introduced a period of abnormally cold and wet winters. This deluge of precipitation resulted in poor harvests as people struggled to cultivate already overworked land.

This led to catastrophic crop failures and widespread famine in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere within the first few decades of the fourteenth century.

全球平均气温总体下降 0.6°C（某 些地区年气温下降多达两度）。更多的水变成冰，可蒸发并转化为雨水的水就越少。尽管影响全球，但小冰河时代的影响在各地并不相同。

- 在地中海和西非，不规则的降雨和干旱使农作 物产量大幅下降，
- 而在中国和北欧，寒冷的天气以及湖泊和河流的结冰尤为明显。
- 1314年，在欧洲和 亚洲的其他地方，暴雨开始降临，导致了异常寒冷和潮湿的冬季。由于人们努力耕种已经过度劳作的 土地，大量降水导致收成不佳。

在 十四世纪的最初几十年内，它导致了北半球许多地区灾难性的农作物歉收和大范围的饥荒。

.案例
====
在这句话中使用 “as” 或 “because” 都可以，但它们有细微的差别，主要体现在句子的语气和重点上：

- “as”：强调两个动作或现象同时发生，或是说明现象随时间的推移逐渐发生变化。它更侧重于过程的自然关联，不一定非常强调因果关系。

例句：“As more water turned to ice, less was available to evaporate and turn into rain.” +
这里的“as”表达的是随着冰的增加，水的蒸发减少，两者几乎是并行的现象。这种表达更侧重于描绘过程中的变化，语气较轻。

- “because”：更直接地强调因果关系，即某个现象明确导致了另一个现象发生。它更明确地回答“为什么”某件事情发生。

例句：“Because more water turned to ice, less was available to evaporate and turn into rain.” +
使用“because”时，重点在于冰的增加是导致水蒸发减少的原因，更加明确地说明了因果关系。它回答了“为什么会有更少的水蒸发”。

总结： +
如果你想轻描淡写地描述两者之间的关联，或将注意力集中在两件事情同时发生的过程中，用 “as” 更为自然。
如果你想更加强调冰的增加直接导致了水的减少，选择 “because” 会更明确。 +
这取决于你想如何引导读者理解两者的关系：是一个自然变化的现象，还是一个因果关系。
====

Ultimately, the Great Famine led many to question the ability of church officials and monarchs to respond effectively to crises and catastrophes, which had long-term effects on public trust in these institutions.

长 期的粮食短缺还导致了广泛的政治和经济不稳定。最终，大饥荒导致许多人质疑教会官员和君主有效应对危机和灾难的能力， 这对公众对这些机构的信任产生了长期影响。

With very few options to remedy the devastation wrought by years of poor weather and famine, most people had little practical recourse other than migrating in search of better conditions.

由于多年来恶劣天气和饥荒造成的破坏，几乎没有什么选择可以补救，大多数人除了迁徙以寻求更好 的条件外，几乎没有其他实际的办法。

At the same time, worsening environmental conditions necessitated travel by many who would rarely have ventured beyond their immediate surroundings but now migrated in search of the resources they needed to survive. Leaving behind all that was familiar in the hope of finding a more stable and hospitable environment, they faced a variety of perils, including regional disputes, adverse weather conditions, illness, and banditry. It was difficult to arrange travel between the many different political entities that existed in the fourteenth century, and crossing borders could be exceptionally risky without the security provided by the presence of established networks or patrons, especially when it came to bandits and lack of access to safe waystations to rest.

与此同时，日益恶化的环境条件使得许多人不得不外出旅行，他们很少冒险走出周围的环境，但现在 却为了寻找生存所需的资源而迁移。他们抛弃了一切熟悉的事物，希望找到一个更稳定、更友善的环 境，但他们面临着各种危险，包括地区争端、恶劣的天气条件、疾病和土匪行为。在十四世纪存在的 许多不同政治实体之间安排旅行是很困难的，如果没有既定网络或赞助人的存在所提供的安全保障， 跨越边界可能会异常危险，尤其是在遇到强盗和缺乏安全的中途休息站的情况下。

Although some people traveled back and forth across borders, the difficulties and expense of fourteenth-century travel made round trips uncommon. Many were forced to abandon their homes knowing they would likely never return. In times of drought and food shortages, these climate refugees faced precarious situations and uncertain prospects. They could become “strangers in strange lands,” foreigners whose unique customs and cultural practices—including religious traditions, dress, and language—marked them as “other” and worthy of scorn.

尽管有些人跨境旅行，但十四世纪旅行的困难和费用使得往返旅行并不常见。许多人被迫离开家园， 因为他们知道自己可能永远不会回来。在干旱和粮食短缺时期，这些气候难民面临着不稳定的处境和 不确定的前景。他们可能成为“异国他乡的陌生人”，这些外国人的独特习俗和文化习俗——包括宗教传 统、服饰和语言——使他们成为“异类”并值得蔑视。

=== 瘟疫 (鼠疫, 黑死病)


The bubonic plague, the most common variant of the disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, raises egg-shaped swellings known as buboes near an afflicted person’s lymph nodes in the groin, underarm, and upper neck areas. For the vast majority in the Middle Ages, death generally occurred within three days.

The disease has a mortality rate ranging from 30 to 80 percent, which is significantly higher than that of the deadliest smallpox, influenza, and polio pandemics of the modern era.

黑死病是由鼠疫耶尔森氏菌引起的最常见的疾病变种，它会在患者腹股沟、腋下和上颈部区域的淋巴 结附近产生蛋形肿胀，称为腹股沟淋巴结炎。对于中世纪的绝大多数人来说，死亡通常发生在三天内。这种死亡率为 30% 至 80% 的疾病, (其致死率)明显高于现 代最致命的天花、流感和脊髓灰质炎大流行。

Although in its bubonic form the plague could not be spread from human to human, the rat flea became a major plague vector. The black rat was one of the most capable animal hosts for the plague-carrying fleas. It was highly susceptible to the disease itself.

Plague-bearing fleas generally preferred to feed on small rodents such as rats and marmots, but when their rodent hosts succumbed to the plague, they secured their next meal from the nearest human.

尽管鼠疫在鼠疫形式下无法在人与人之间传播，但鼠蚤成为主要的鼠疫媒介. 黑鼠是携带鼠疫跳蚤的最有能力的动物宿主之一。它本身就很容易感染这种疾病. 携带瘟疫的跳蚤通常更喜欢以老鼠和土拨鼠等小型啮齿动物为食，但当它们的啮齿动物宿主死于瘟疫 时，它们会从最近的人类那里获得下一顿饭。

Two even deadlier variants of the disease eventually emerged during the fourteenth century: pneumonic and septicemic.

在十四世纪，这种疾病最终出现了两种更致命的变种： 肺炎型和败血症型。

|pneumonic :
|The pneumonic form directly infected the lungs and was spread from person to person by coughing, with a mortality rate of 95 to 100 percent.

肺炎形式直接感染肺部，并通过咳嗽在人与人之间传播，死亡率为 95% 至 100%。

|septicemic :
|The septicemic variant, which resulted from plague bacteria circulating directly into the bloodstream, was invariably fatal and, according to contemporary observers, seemed to kill within hours of the first onset of symptoms.

这种败血症变异是由鼠疫细菌直接循环到血液中引起的，总是致命的，根据当代观察家的说 法，似乎在首次出现症状后数小时内就会死亡。

|传播过程
|While historians had surmised for many decades that the plague had spread in primarily one form (bubonic) and in one direction (east to west), new evidence increasingly suggests there was a far greater diversity of spread.

虽然历史学家几十年来一直猜测鼠疫主要以一种形式 （腺鼠疫）和一个方向（从东到西）传播，但新的证据越来越多地表明，鼠疫的传播方式更加多样 化。

Although the exact date of the Black Death’s arrival in China remains unknown, Chinese historical records first refer to the appearance of a deadly epidemic in the years from 1331 to 1334.

尽管黑死病传入中国的确切日期仍不得而知，但中国的历史记录首先提到了1331年至1334年期间出现 的致命流行病。大约有一千三百万人在这次致命的疫 情中丧生。

After ravaging China, the plague continued to spread west along trade routes by land and sea.

在肆虐中国之后，瘟疫继续沿着陆路和海上贸易路线向西传播.

The plague spread into the European interior, leaving perhaps as many as twenty-four million dead, roughly 30 percent of the continent’s population at the time.

瘟疫传播到欧洲 内陆，导致大约 2400 万人死亡，约占当时欧洲大陆人口的 30%。

After the plague had run its course by the 1350s, it recurred in cyclical fashion several times during the second half of the fourteenth century. It was never fully eradicated.

瘟疫在 1350 年代结束后，在 14 世纪下半叶周期性地复发了几次。它从未被完全根除.

|人们的思想变化
|Social responses to the plague in medieval Europe ranged from increased piety to hedonism to resigned acceptance of inevitable death.

中世纪欧洲对瘟疫的社会反应从日益虔 诚, 到享乐主义，再到放弃接受不可避免的死亡。

|对社会变化的影响
|The plague left each region it affected with long-term economic and demographic consequences. Old systems of belief came into question, and ancient social hierarchies shifted to accommodate the significant population losses that followed the plague.

瘟疫给它所影响的每个地区带来了长期的经济和人口后果，旧的信仰体系受到质疑，古代的社会等级制度也发生了转变，以适应瘟疫后 人口的大量流失。

- The disadvantaged began to question whether social elites really did enjoy God’s privilege, as the social hierarchy generally preached, since they too succumbed to the plague and failed to care for those to whom they bore responsibility. +
Failing to fully grasp how and why the disease was spreading, however, many of the devout turned to the clergy, who were also dying in record numbers, mostly because of their efforts to care for the sick.


由于无法完全掌握这种疾病传播的方式和原 因，许多虔诚的信徒转向神职人员，而神职人员的死亡人数也创历史新高，主要是因为他们努力照顾 病人。 +
弱势群体开始质疑社 会精英是否真的像社会等级制度普遍宣扬的那样享有上帝的特权，因为他们也死于瘟疫，并且没有照 顾那些他们负有责任的人。

- Peasants, laborers, and those at the lower end of the socioeconomic hierarchy tended to experience the greatest mortality, but for those who survived, pronounced labor shortages led to the demise of some industries and more favorable working conditions in others.

农民、工人和处于社会经济阶层低端的人往往死亡率最高，但对于那些幸存下来的 人来说，明显的劳动力短缺导致一些行业的消亡和其他行业更有利的工作条件。

Given massive depopulation, people increasingly chose to leave locations to which they had formerly been anchored. Peasants left the feudal estates on which their families had lived for generations, as landlords elsewhere offered more generous terms of labor to attract workers who could replace the dead. Many peasants also left the countryside to seek wage labor and employment in cities, which began experiencing significant labor shortages as a result of the plague’s staggering death toll. Because the demand for labor was so high, peasants who remained in the countryside, especially males, were now able to press their employers for more money and rights.

由于人口大量减少, 人们越来越多地选择离开他们以前居住的地方。农民们 离开了他们的家人世代居住的封建庄园，因为其他地方的地主提供了更慷慨的劳动条件来吸引可以替 代死者的工人。许多农民也离开农村到城市寻找工资劳动和就业机会，由于瘟疫造成的惊人死亡人 数，城市开始出现严重的劳动力短缺。由于对劳动力的需求如此之高，留在农村的农民，尤其是男 性，现在能够向雇主施压，要求更多的金钱和权利。

With fewer people to work their land and generate income for them, their collective wealth contracted significantly. The power of local nobles and landowners was also being eclipsed by more powerful monarchs and emerging urban economies that bolstered the growth of towns and cities.

由于耕种土地和创造收入的人越来越少，(地主)他们的集体财富大幅萎缩。当地贵族 和地主的权力也被更强大的君主和新兴城市经济所掩盖，这些经济促进了城镇的发展。

- The death of many members of the clergy during the Black Death made monarchs more dependent on the merchant class to perform services for which education was required. The rising prominence of the merchant class that resulted.

黑死病期间许多神职人员的死亡使君主更加依赖商人阶级来提供需要教育的服务。由此导致的 商人阶级的地位日益突出

|构成:
|In the fourteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire, which had been founded by Charlemagne in 800, comprised four main entities—the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Germany (including lands that now are part of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), the Kingdom of Burgundy (a region in southeastern France), and the Kingdom of Bohemia (what is now the Czech Republic and part of Poland) under the nominal control of an elected emperor. Each of these kingdoms, in turn, was composed of a loose coalition of independent territories with different hereditary rulers.

14世纪，查理曼大帝于公元800年建立的神圣罗马帝国由四个主要实体组成:意大利王国、德意志王国(包括现在属于比利时、荷兰、德国、奥地利和瑞士的土地)、勃艮第王国(法国东南部的一个地区)和波希米亚王国(现在的捷克共和国和波兰的一部分)，名义上由一位当选皇帝控制。这些王国依次由独立领土的松散联盟和不同的世袭统治者组成。

Rather than adopting a common currency, legal system, or representative assembly, the Holy Roman Empire remained a patchwork of semiautonomous principalities. Although each of these became relatively stable, the empire itself was a weak and decentralized political entity. By the end of the fourteenth century, it included more than one hundred principalities, each with varying degrees of power and autonomy.

神圣罗马帝国并没有采用共同的货币、法律体系或代表大会，而是由半自治的公国拼凑而成。尽管这 些都变得相对稳定，但帝国本身是一个软弱且分散的政治实体。到十四世纪末，它包括一百多个公 国，每个公国都拥有不同程度的权力和自治权。

|国王来源:
|The emperor was chosen by a handful of these rulers known as electors.

皇帝是由少数被称为选帝侯的统治者选出的。

The emperor was now beholden to both the rulers who elected him and the pope, who in theory bestowed the imperial crown.

皇帝现在既要感谢选举他的统治者，也要感谢教皇， 理论上，教皇授予了皇冠。
