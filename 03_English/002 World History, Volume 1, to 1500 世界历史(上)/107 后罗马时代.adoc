== 007 后罗马时代

Western Afro-Eurasia faced a number of challenges in the early Middle Ages, the period from about 500 to 1000 CE. With the collapse of Roman authority came a time of political instability and insecurity. Cities declined, and institutions of learning weakened. Western Europe became increasingly rural. Because there was no longer a strong centralized state to develop and police the roads, travel became more difficult and more dangerous, harming commerce. However, The Byzantine Greeks maintained some classical traditions, and their capital in Constantinople was a center of global trade for centuries. Germanic kings sought to form new alliances with Christian leaders and participate in world trade and diplomacy.

西非-欧亚大陆在中世纪早期（大约公元 500 年至 1000 年）面临着许多挑战。随着罗马权威的崩溃， 政治不稳定和不安全的时期到来了。城市衰落，学习机构衰弱。西欧变得越来越乡村化。由于不再有 一个强大的中央集权国家来开发和监管道路，旅行变得更加困难和危险，损害了商业。 然而, 拜占庭希腊 人保留了一些古典传统，他们的首都君士坦丁堡是几个世纪以来全球贸易的中心。日耳曼国王寻求与 基督教领袖建立新的联盟，并参与世界贸易和外交。

Western Europe’s political order fragmented under Germanic warlords empowered.

西欧的政治秩序在日耳曼军阀的统治 下支离破碎.

the eastern half of the Roman Empire did not collapse until the fifteenth century. Traditionally, though, the end of the empire is fixed at 476, when a German general named Odoacer deposed the emperor Romulus Augustulus and established himself not as a Roman emperor but as King of Italy. Even that date may be arbitrary, but by the late fifth century, traditional Roman authority had ceased to be the basis of political power in much of western Europe.

罗马帝国的东半部直到十五世纪才崩溃。不 过，传统上，帝国的终结被定为 476 年，当时一位名叫奥多亚塞 ( Odoacer ) 的德国将军废黜了罗穆卢 斯·奥古斯都鲁斯 (Romulus Augustulus)皇帝，并确立了自己的身份，而不是罗马皇帝，而是意大利国 王。即使这个日期可能是任意的，但到了五世纪末，传统的罗马权威已经不再是西欧大部分地区政治 权力的基础。

The Germanic peoples and the Roman population they conquered were able to create a new society by blending cultural traditions—a process called acculturation—in three ways. First, conversion to Christianity helped reduce differences between the two groups. Second, the Christian Church and the Roman aristocracy offered a useful example of bureaucratic organization and diplomacy that the successor kingdoms adopted. Finally, the erosion of Roman society enabled a new society to emerge in the Middle Ages. Although other Germanic kingdoms existed, those established by the Franks, Ostrogoths, and Visigoths demonstrate these three forms of acculturation most vividly.

日耳曼人民和他们征服的罗马人民能够通过三种 方式融合文化传统（这一过程称为文化适应）来创建一个新社会。首先，皈依基督教有助于减少两个 群体之间的差异。其次，基督教会和罗马贵族为后继王国所采用的官僚组织和外交提供了有用的范 例。最后，罗马社会的侵蚀使得一个新社会在中世纪出现。尽管也存在其他日耳曼王国，但法兰克 人、东哥特人和西哥特人建立的王国最生动地展示了这三种文化适应形式。

“German” was the term Romans used for all the peoples beyond their northern borders, and for them, it was interchangeable with “barbarian,” meaning not Romanized, although there was a great deal of cultural exchange between the two groups. The relationship between the term “German” and the peoples to whom it has been applied is complex. Some of those who invaded the Roman Empire did not speak a Germanic language at all, such as the Huns and Avars. There were few rigid ethnic boundaries between the groups, and the armies of any leader often included warriors from other tribes.

“日耳曼人”是罗马人用来称呼北方边界以外的所有民族的术语，对他们来说，它可以与“野蛮人”互换， 意思是没有罗马化，尽管这两个群体之间有大量的文化交流。 “德国”一词与其所适用的民族之间的关 系很复杂。有些入侵罗马帝国的人根本不会说日耳曼语言，例如匈奴人和阿瓦尔人。这些群体之间几 乎没有严格的种族界限，任何领导者的军队通常都包括来自其他部落的战士。

The Germanic peoples generally did not read or write and instead transmitted information and traditions orally. Famous tales that eventually found their way into written form, such as the Song of Hildebrand and the Song of the Nibelungs, had their beginnings as spoken epics.

日耳曼民族一般不读书或写字，而是口头传播信息和传统。最终以书面形式出现的著名故事，例如 《希尔德布兰德之歌》和《尼伯龙根之歌》 ，最初都是口头史诗。

The Anglo-Saxon peoples who settled in the British Isles, a mix of many cultures including Germanic. In particular, they loved riddles.

定居在不列颠群岛的盎格鲁-撒克逊人是包括日耳曼文化在内的多种文化的混合体，他们特别喜欢猜谜语.

Across all Germanic societies, warfare was an important tool for building social prestige. There were no formal hierarchies, so advancement was possible for any willing to serve a powerful chieftain or king. In return, leaders promised loot and the chance to do great deeds. A king who could not ensure material or social resources would lose followers and could not expect to be obeyed.

在所有日耳曼社会中，战争是建立社会威望的重要工具。没有正式的等级制度，因此任何愿意为强大 的酋长或国王服务的人都有可能晋升。作为回报，领导人承诺提供战利品和做大事的机会。一个无法 确保物质或社会资源的国王将会失去追随者，也无法指望得到服从。

The Germans were polytheistic, worshipping various deities.

日耳曼人是多神论者，崇拜各种神祇.

As an example of acculturation, Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, was one of the most dynamic leaders of the post-Roman world. When he became King of Italy in 493, he relied on Roman aristocrats to administer his kingdom. He used diplomacy to secure alliances with other German kings, often through marriages. To form an alliance with the Franks, for instance, he himself wed Audofleda, the sister of Clovis I, king of the Franks, and he gave his daughters in marriage to other Germanic kings. Envisioning himself as the heir to Roman rule in the west, he maintained ties with the eastern Roman emperors and strove to revive trade with the eastern Mediterranean world.

作为文化适应的一个例子，东哥特人国王狄奥多里克大帝是后罗马世界最有活力的领导人之一。当他 于493年成为意大利国王时，他依靠罗马贵族来管理他的王国. 他利用 外交手段与其他德国国王建立联盟，通常是通过联姻。例如，为了与法兰克人结盟，他亲自与法兰克 国王克洛维一世的妹妹奥多弗莱达结婚，并将自己的女儿嫁给了其他日耳曼国王。他将自己视为罗马 在西方统治的继承人，与东罗马皇帝保持着联系，并努力恢复与东地中海世界的贸易。

Toleration was possible in the early Middle Ages, but distrust between religious groups could spark outright violence and persecution.

在中世纪早期，(宗教)宽容是可能的，但宗教团体之间的 不信任可能引发彻底的暴力和迫害。

The most successful Germanic kingdom was that of the Franks. Clovis I, a member of the Merovingian dynasty, founded the kingdom in the early sixth century.

A chief source of conflict was the practice of partible inheritance, whereby each son received an equal share of his father’s estate. Estates thus became smaller with each successive generation unless new lands were conquered, often by being taken from siblings, in-laws, or cousins. Kings without land and resources to offer as reward lost the ability to attract fighters. Real power lay with the aristocrats, and eventually a new dynasty called the Carolingians took control of the Frankish kingdom. With the support of the pope, Pépin le Bref (Pippin the Short) became the first Carolingian king of the Franks, deposing his Merovingian rival. In return, he confirmed a grant of lands in Italy to the pope. This grant, known as the Donation of Pepin, provided the legal basis for the establishment of the Papal States and helped ensure that the papacy, the set of administrative structures associated with the government of the Catholic Church, was not just a religious institution but also a territorial power.

最成功的日耳曼王国是法兰克王国。墨洛温王朝成员克洛维一世于六世纪初建立了王国. 随着时间的推移，墨洛温王朝的统治者陷入了暴力的内讧. 冲突的一个主要根源是分割继承的做法，即每个儿子均分其父亲的遗产。因此，每一代人 的庄园都会变得越来越小，除非征服了新的土地，通常是从兄弟姐妹、姻亲或表兄弟那里夺取的。没 有土地和资源作为奖励的国王就失去了吸引战士的能力。真正的权力掌握在贵族手中，最终一个名为 加洛林王朝的新王朝控制了法兰克王国。

在教皇的支持下，佩平·勒·布雷夫（Pépin le Bref）（矮子皮 平）推翻了墨洛温王朝的对手，成为法兰克人的第一位加洛林国王。作为回报，他确认将意大利的土 地授予教皇。这笔被称为“丕平捐赠”的赠款为教皇国的建立提供了法律基础，并有助于确保教皇权（与 天主教会政府相关的一系列行政机构）不仅是一个宗教机构，而且也是一个宗教机构。领土权力

Their alliance with the popes allowed the Carolingian rulers to work independently of the Byzantine Empire.

他们与教皇的联盟使加洛林统治者能够独立于拜占庭帝国运作.

Pépin’s son Charles, known as Charlemagne (“Charles the Great”), was the most influential ruler in the early European Middle Ages. He campaigned nearly every year of his reign, uniting western Europe for the first time since the collapse of Roman authority.

On Christmas Day in the year 800, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III. This coronation angered Byzantine rulers and set the stage for conflict between east and west in their quest for prestige and territory.

佩潘的儿子查理，被称为查理曼大帝（“查理大帝”），是欧洲中世纪早期最有影响力的统治者. 他在位期间几乎每年都征战，自罗马权威崩溃以来首次统一了西欧。 800年圣诞节，查理 曼大帝被教皇利奥三世加冕为罗马皇帝。这次加冕礼激怒了拜占庭统治者，并为东西方之间争夺威望 和领土的冲突埋下了伏笔。

Charlemagne’s empire did not last. These internal problems were worsened by external ones, especially new invaders emboldened by the collapse of Carolingian strength. From the east came nomadic raiders, the Magyars, a non- Germanic people who migrated from the steppes of central Asia. At the end of the ninth century, they settled in what is today Hungary, and from there they launched devastating raids for plunder into Germany.

查理曼的帝国并没有持续多久。 这些内部问题因外部问题而变得更加严重，尤其是由于加洛林王朝实力崩溃而胆大妄为的新入侵者。 来自东方的游牧掠夺者马扎尔人是从中亚草原迁徙而来的非日耳曼民族。九世纪末，他们定居在今天 的匈牙利，并从那里对德国发起毁灭性的掠夺。

Perhaps more famous today than the Magyars and Islamic raiders were the Norse who raided northern Europe from Scandinavia, called the Vikings. The peoples of Scandinavia, who spoke Germanic languages, had a culture similar to that of the Germanic peoples who settled in the Roman Empire. For example, Scandinavians were polytheistic. The aristocracy practiced polygyny (having many wives), and local chieftains rewarded their followers with lands and gifts. The growth of the population in the eighth century and the relative lack of arable land in Scandinavia compelled groups of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes to travel in search of plunder.

Some made trading connections along the Dnieper River, establishing settlements at Kiev that eventually became one of the first Russian states. They reached Constantinople, and some served as the personal bodyguard to the Byzantine ruler. These Vikings were known as Varangians, and they settled in eastern Europe.

Although violent, they were also traders, interested in paving the way for new settlements and connections beyond western Europe.

今天，也许比马扎尔人和伊斯兰袭击者更出名的是从斯堪的纳维亚半岛袭击北欧的挪威人，即维京 人。斯堪的纳维亚半岛的人民讲日耳曼语言，其文化与定居在罗马帝国的日耳曼人民相似。例如，斯 堪的纳维亚人是多神论者，贵 族实行一夫多妻制（拥有许多妻子），当地酋长用土地和礼物奖励他们的追随者。八世纪人口的增长 和斯堪的纳维亚半岛耕地的相对缺乏迫使丹麦人、挪威人和瑞典人前往寻找掠夺品。有些人沿着第聂伯河建立贸易联系，在基辅建立定居点，最终成 为俄罗斯最早的国家之一。他们到达君士坦丁堡，其中一些人担任拜占庭统治者的私人保镖。这些维 京人被称为瓦兰吉人，他们定居在东欧。尽管暴力，他们也是商人，有兴趣为西欧以外的新定居点和 联系铺平道路。

In the west, the arrival of the Norse raiders was less benign. The sudden nature of the violent raids, and the inability of Frankish or Anglo-Saxon armies to defeat them, instilled fear in the population of western Europe.

在西方，挪威入侵者的到来就不那么友好了。暴力袭击的突然性，以及法兰克或盎格鲁撒 克逊军队无力击败他们，给西欧人民带来了恐惧。

Eventually, the Norse raiders began to settle in regions rather than just raid them. In 865, a substantial army of Vikings invaded Britain and destroyed most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except for Wessex. In 911, they settled in northern France, establishing the duchy of Normandy. By the end of the tenth century, Vikings had also established settlements throughout the British Isles, including Ireland and Scotland, farther west in Iceland and Greenland, and even (though briefly) in North America. Not just raiders, they promoted trade throughout northern Europe and beyond, extending their trading routes to the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate. Like the earlier Germanic peoples, they eventually converted to Roman Christianity, and their kings began to build more centralized kingdoms that enabled them to curb the violence of the raiders.

最终，挪威掠夺者开始在一些地区定居，而不仅仅是袭击它们。 865年，维京人大军入侵不列颠，摧毁 了除威塞克斯以外的大部分盎格鲁撒克逊王国。 911年，他们在法国北部定居，建立诺曼底公国。到十 世纪末，维京人还在不列颠群岛各地建立了定居点，包括爱尔兰和苏格兰，更西边的冰岛和格陵兰 岛，甚至（尽管短暂）北美。他们不仅是掠夺者，还促进整个北欧及其他地区的贸易，将贸易路线延 伸至拜占庭帝国和阿巴斯哈里发国。像早期的日耳曼民族一样，他们最终皈依了罗马基督教，他们的 国王开始建立更加中央集权的王国，使他们能够遏制入侵者的暴力。

In the ashes of the Carolingian world, medieval Europe embraced a social system called feudalism. Lords began to grant lands to fighters as their fiefs, whose produce the warriors could enjoy so long as they served the lord. For their part, fighters became vassals of the lord, sworn to perform service in exchange for the land. This service was chiefly military in nature, but it could also include other obligations like advising the lord and attending his court when called. Bishoprics and monasteries behaved the same way; abbots and abbesses could be lords who were owed service and also owed service to greater lords.

在加洛林世界的废墟中，中世纪的欧洲拥抱了一种被称为封建主义的社会制度. 领主开始将土地授予战士作为 他们的封地，只要战士为领主服务，他们就可以享用他们的农产品。就战士而言，他们成为领主的附 庸，发誓为土地服务。这项服务本质上主要是军事性的，但也可能包括其他义务，例如向领主提供建 议以及在接到命令时出席他的宫廷。主教辖区和修道院的行为方式相同。修道院院长和修道院长可以 是领主，他们应该为更大的领主服务。

While feudalism was not a political system, warriors owed service to lords who owed service to the king, who in theory was the largest landowner in the kingdom and the guarantor of rights and privileges. For example, the late Carolingian king Charles the Simple granted the Duchy of Normandy to the Viking leader Rollo, so long as Rollo protected northern France from other Vikings. However, the need to placate their feudal lords ensured that kings gave away lands and privileges, often weakening them. In other cases, crushing rebellious vassals was a way of taking back needed land.

虽然封建制度不是一种政治制度，但战士们要为领主服务，而领主又要为国王服务，理论上，国王是 王国最大的地主，也是权利和特权的保障者。例如，已故的加洛林国王查理一世将诺曼底公国授予维 京领导人罗洛，只要罗洛保护法国北部免受其他维京人的侵害。然而，为了安抚封建领主，国王们不 得不放弃土地和特权，这往往会削弱他们的实力. 在其他情况下，镇压叛乱的封臣是夺回 所需土地的一种方式。(削藩)

On their fiefs, the warriors oversaw the work of agricultural laborers. Some laborers might own their own land and be self-directed, but most in western Europe were unfree, servile laborers called serfs who were tied to the land. They were not enslaved and could not be bought or sold, but they occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder.

在他们的封地里，战士们监督农业劳动者的工作。一些劳动者可能拥有自己的土地并且可以自我指 导，但在西欧，大多数劳动者都是不自由的奴役劳动者，被称为农奴，他们被束缚在土地上。他们不 是奴隶，不能被买卖，但他们处于社会阶梯的最底层.

The lord was required to protect the serfs, resolve their disputes, and administer their work. Serfs owed their lord a set number of days of service a year (these were many) and could not leave the land, marry, or undertake other work without the lord’s permission. Under manorialism or the manor system, named for the manor house occupied by the lord, serfs (or other varieties of servile, unfree workers) were brought together into villages where their labor could be cooperative. They tended both their own and their lord’s land, sharing draft animals and farm implements to undertake the planting and harvesting of crops. Although cities on the coast often maintained commercial or networking ties with each other, society in western Europe was overwhelmingly rural, and production was largely at the subsistence level. People produced what they were going to consume, and surplus went to the lord or the church as a mandatory tax, usually 10 percent, called the tithe.

领主必须保护农奴、解决他们的纠纷并管理他们的工作。农奴每年要为领主服务一定天数（这些天数 很多），未经领主许可不得离开土地、结婚或从事其他工作。在庄园主义或庄园制度下，农奴（或其 他种类的奴役、不自由的工人）被聚集到村庄，在那里他们的劳动可以合作。他们照料自己和领主的 土地，共享役畜和农具来种植和收获农作物。尽管沿海 城市经常相互保持商业或网络联系，但西欧社会绝大多数是农村，生产主要处于自给自足的水平。人 们生产他们要消费的东西，剩余的东西作为强制税交给领主或教会，通常是 10%，称为什一税。

By the tenth century, the old Roman Empire was largely forgotten by the general population.

到了十世 纪，古老的罗马帝国在很大程度上被普通民众遗忘.

There were three ways in which the church helped transform the old Roman world into the new. First, the institutional church, often under the guidance of the popes, worked to convert the Germanic peoples to Christianity. Second, it helped to preserve the classical tradition. Finally, it worked with the new rulers to help legitimize their rule and Christianize their populations.

教会通过三种方式帮助将旧罗马世界转变为新世界。首先，制度化的教会通常在教皇的指导下， 努力使日耳曼人民皈依基督教。其次，它有助于保存古典传统。最后，它与新统治者合作，帮助他们 的统治合法化，并使人民基督教化。

Pope Gregory (also known as Gregory the Great) commissioned monks from Italy, led by Augustine of Canterbury, to convert the Anglo-Saxons. (Monks are men who do not marry, often live in community with each other, and devote their lives to serving God. Their female counterparts are called nuns.) 教皇格列 高利（也称为格列高利大帝）委托坎特伯雷的奥古斯丁领导的来自意大利的僧侣去改变盎格鲁撒克逊 人的信仰。 （僧侣是不结婚的男性，经常集体生活，一生致力于侍奉上帝。她们的女性同行被称为修 女。）

Monastic communities were often critical to the preservation of learning in the post-Roman world. There, monks copied out books by hand to preserve knowledge they thought was useful from the ancient world.

修道院社区对于后罗马世界的学术保护往往至关重要。在那里，僧侣们手工抄写书籍，保存他们认为来自古代世界的有用知识。

Christians often viewed Jewish people as outsiders. The mistaken belief that Jewish people were to blame for the death of Jesus led to rumors that they wanted to harm Christians. the position of Jewish communities in the Middle Ages was often precarious.

基督徒经常将犹太人视为外 来者，人们错误地认为犹太人应对耶稣的死负责，这导致了他们想 要伤害基督徒的谣言. 中世纪犹太社区的地位常常不稳定。

In 711, however, the armies of the Umayyad Caliphate crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and overran the kingdom. The Umayyad armies that invaded Spain never succeeded in controlling the entire peninsula. Christian kingdoms persisted in the north, though they were weak and often fought with each other. Another reason was that non-Arabic soldiers, like the North African Amazigh (Berbers), always felt shortchanged when Arab leaders divided the spoils of conquest. This ethnic and regional conflict played an important role in the collapse of the Umayyad dynasty.

711年，倭马亚哈里发的军队越过直布罗陀海峡并占领了该王 国。入侵西班牙的倭马亚军队从未成功控制整个半岛，基督教王国在北方仍然存在， 尽管它们很弱并且经常互相争斗。另一个原因是，当阿拉伯领导人瓜分征服的战利品时，非阿拉伯士 兵，如北非阿马齐格人（柏柏尔人），总是感到自己受到了欺骗。这场种族和地区冲突在倭马亚王朝 的崩溃中发挥了重要作用.

Under Islamic law, Christians and Jewish people were considered “protected.” This meant that because they also believed in one God, they could not be compelled to convert so long as they did not challenge the beliefs of Muslims. Some historians have viewed this period of toleration, now called convivencia (“living together”), as a particular example. while toleration was always possible, it depended on the presence of willing leaders for whom peace was desirable. When conflict between Christians and Muslins was exacerbated, religious tensions could make toleration less desirable.

根据伊斯兰教法，基督徒和犹太人被认为是“受保护的”。这意味着，由于他们也信仰 独一真主，只要他们不挑战穆斯林的信仰，就不会被迫皈依。一些历史学家将这段现在称为“共存”（ convivencia ）的宽容时期视为一个特殊例子。虽然宽容总是可能的，但它取决于 是否有愿意和平的领导人的存在。当基督徒和穆斯林之间的冲突加剧时，宗教紧张局势可能会使宽容 变得不那么可取.

When the last Muslim kingdom fell in 1492, Christian rulers reversed course and instituted policies of intolerance to ensure that Catholicism became a central part of Spanish identity.

当最后一个穆斯林王国于 1492 年垮台时，基督教统治者改变了路线并制定了不宽容政策，以 确保天主教成为西班牙身份的核心部分。

Despite the ongoing toleration that rulers of one faith could show to subjects of another, conflicts between rulers of different faiths persisted.

尽管一种信仰的统治者可以对另一种信仰的臣民表现出持续的宽容，但不同信仰的统治者之间的冲突 仍然存在.

The chaotic aftermath of the collapse of the Carolingian Empire led to a complicated situation between secular rulers and the Christian Church. According to German law, lords had the right to control everything on their land, including churches and monasteries. This control even extended to the appointment of officeholders to church positions such as abbot or bishop. To ensure they had the loyalty of church officials, lords staffed these offices with their family members or even sold them to the highest bidder. The consequence was that those without religious vocations, or even familiarity with Christian doctrine, could be installed into church leadership. Even the position of the pope, the bishop of Rome, could come up for sale.

加洛林帝国崩溃后的混乱导致世俗统治者和基督教会之间的复杂局面。根据德国法律，领主有权控制 其土地上的一切，包括教堂和修道院。这种控制甚至延伸到任命官员担任教会职务，例如方丈或主 教。为了确保教会官员的忠诚，领主们在这些办公室里配备了他们的家人，甚至将它们卖给出价最高 的人。结果是，那些没有宗教职业，甚至不熟悉基督教教义的人，可以被任命为教会领导层。甚至罗 马教皇、罗马主教的职位也可能被出售。(买官卖官)

Revulsion at this treatment of religious office led to a reform movement intended to remove the influence of secular lords from the management of the church. The movement is often associated with the monastery of Cluny in France, which managed to get independence from the local aristocrat. Other monasteries around France flocked to be included in the rights and privileges that Cluny had earned, creating a movement called the Cluniac reform. The Cluniac movement eventually drew in other clergy who wanted the church to control the election of bishops, independent of secular influence.

对宗教职务这种待遇的反感引发了一场改革运动，旨在消除世俗领主对教会管理的影响。该运动通常 与法国克鲁尼修道院联系在一起，该修道院成功地从当地贵族手中获得了独立。法国各地的其他修道 院蜂拥而至，希望获得克鲁尼所赢得的权利和特权，从而引发了一场名为“克鲁尼改革”的运动。克吕尼 运动最终吸引了其他神职人员，他们希望教会能够独立于世俗影响来控制主教的选举。

The bishops of Rome were eventually influenced by the Cluniac movement to reform the church. They condemned the sale of offices as a sin called simony and insisted that bishops should be elected by clergy, independent of a lord. Any clergy member who had bought an office or had it bought for them could be removed. To end the practice of treating church positions like a fief to be passed on to the officeholder’s children, priests were told to practice celibacy and were forbidden to marry. These changes caused bitter conflict with the rulers of Europe, so the church declared that a king who tried to appoint a bishop or asked for a bribe could be excommunicated (placed outside the church, its communion, and the sacraments, in hopes of reforming the offender). Excommunication could threaten the king’s position and lead to rebellions.

罗马主教最终受到克吕尼运动的影响，改革教会。他们谴责出售官职是一种被称为买卖圣职的罪孽， 并坚持认为主教应该由神职人员选举产生，独立于领主。任何购买办公室或为他们购买办公室的神职 人员都可以被解雇。为了结束将教会职位视为封地传给官员子女的做法，牧师被告知要独身，并禁止 结婚。这些变化引起 了与欧洲统治者的激烈冲突，因此教会宣布，试图任命主教或索贿的国王可能会被逐出教会（置于教 会、圣餐和圣礼之外，以期改革教会制度）。罪犯）。逐出教会可能会威胁国王的地位并导致叛乱。

The reformers were also interested in creating a thoroughly Christianized society by distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate warfare. The church argued that Christian soldiers, especially knights, should obey a code of conduct that reflected the church’s values. For example, they should not loot monasteries or hold clergy for ransom. They should protect the church as well as women and the defenseless. They should observe periods of publicly declared truces and not fight on religiously significant days like Easter. These principles contributed to the ideals of chivalry.

改革者还希望通过区分合法战争和非法战争来创建一个彻底基督教化的社会。教会认为基督教士兵， 尤其是骑士，应该遵守反映教会价值观的行为准则。例如，他们不应该抢劫修道院或扣留神职人员勒 索赎金。他们应该保护教会以及妇女和手无寸铁的人。他们应该遵守公开宣布的休战期，不要在复活 节等具有宗教意义的日子里打架。这些原则促成了骑士精神的理想.

The reform movement gained the church some moral prestige, but the growing power of the pope also worsened the relationship between the eastern and western halves of the faith. By the time of the Middle Ages, five ancient seats of Christianity were recognized as the most prestigious: Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople. Each was led by a bishop with the honorary title of “patriarch.” In the tenth century, only Rome and Constantinople were in territory not controlled by Muslims.

改革运动为教会赢得了一定的道德威望，但教皇权力的不断增长也恶化了东西方信仰之间的关系。到 了中世纪，五个古老的基督教圣地被认为是最有声望的：耶路撒冷、安条克、亚历山大、罗马和君士 坦丁堡。每个人都由一位享有“族长”荣誉称号的主教领导。十世纪时，只有罗马和君士坦丁堡处于非穆 斯林控制的地区。

While the pope in Rome and the patriarch of Constantinople believed many of the same things, linguistic and cultural differences helped drive a wedge between them. For example, the church in the west operated in Latin, insisted on a celibate clergy, and elevated the pope as the final authority for all matters regarding the church everywhere. The church in the east used Greek, permitted priests to marry (although tradition held that bishops should be unmarried), and believed other patriarchs were just as authoritative as the pope. The reform movement unintentionally made divisions sharper.

虽然罗马教皇和君士坦丁堡宗主教相信许多相同的事情，但语言和文化差异导致了他们之间的分歧。 例如，西方教会以拉丁语运作，坚持独身神职人员，并将教皇提升为各地教会所有事务的最终权威。 东方教会使用希腊语，允许牧师结婚（尽管传统认为主教应该不婚），并相信其他族长与教皇一样具 有权威。改革运动无意中加剧了分歧。

In 1054, the pope sent representatives to the patriarch of Constantinople to discuss the differences between the two halves of the church. The pope’s chief representative felt the patriarch was not cooperating with or even recognizing the embassy, so he issued a letter excommunicating the patriarch and his followers. Soon after, the patriarch issued his own letter excommunicating the pope’s representatives. Following this Great Schism of 1054, the eastern church became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the western half the Catholic Church.

1054年，教皇派代表去见君士坦丁堡宗主教，讨论教会两半之间的分歧。教皇的首席代表认为宗主教 不与大使馆合作，甚至不承认大使馆，因此他发出了一封信，将宗主教及其追随者逐出教会。不久之 后，宗主教发表了自己的信，将教皇的代表逐出教会。 1054年大分裂之后，东部教会被称为东正教， 而西部教会被称为天主教堂。

In 1095, facing invasion on all sides, the Byzantine ruler Alexios I sent ambassadors to plead for help from the pope and an opportunity for a reconciliation between the two churches. Pope Urban II was a supporter of church reform, and that put him at odds with German emperors like Henry IV, who insisted on his own right to appoint bishops, even the bishop of Rome. Urban answered the Byzantine emperor’s call for aid.

1095年，面对四面楚歌的入侵，拜占庭统治者阿莱克修斯一世派遣大使向教皇请求帮助，并为两个教 会提供和解的机会。教皇乌尔班二世是教会改革的支持者，这使他与亨利四世等德国皇帝产生了分 歧，亨利四世坚持自己任命主教的权利，甚至是罗马主教。乌 尔班回应了拜占庭皇帝的援助呼吁.

Urban II presented his idea of religious war in response to the Byzantine request for aid at a council in Clermont, France, in 1095. While the council was ostensibly about reform, Urban also issued a call for Christians from all walks of life to undertake an “armed pilgrimage” to liberate the Christian Holy Land (the lands of the eastern Mediterranean associated with the life of Jesus and the biblical prophets, including Jerusalem) from “Turkic” control. Urban’s goal at this point was to free the Holy Land from non-Christian rulers in defense of the Christians living there; it was not a blanket endorsement of violence against Muslims. These limitations were later eased, however, as the popes discovered the power of calling repeated crusades to promote the reforming goals of the church and to compete with political rivals in Europe, like the German emperors.

1095 年，乌尔班二世在法国克莱蒙的一次会议上提出了他的宗教战争想法，以回应拜占庭的援助请 求。虽然该会议表面上是在讨论改革，但乌尔班二世也呼吁各行各业的基督徒开展一项改革。 “武装朝 圣”，旨在将基督教圣地（与耶稣和圣经先知的生活有关的东地中海土地，包括耶路撒冷）从“突厥”控 制下解放出来。乌尔班此时的目标是将圣地从非基督教统治者手中解放出来，以保卫居住在那里的基 督徒。这并不是全面支持针对穆斯林的暴力行为。然而，这些限制后来得到了缓解，因为教皇发现了 号召反复十字军东征来促进教会改革目标并与德国皇帝等欧洲政治对手竞争的力量。

While the Byzantine emperor wanted aid for his realm, Urban instead sent the crusaders to Jerusalem.

当拜占庭皇帝希望为他的王国提供援助时，乌尔班却将十字军派往耶路撒冷。

The popes had no armies, and they often had to depend on the unreliable aristocracy for protection when disagreements over church policy resulted in armed conflict with the princes of Europe. If they were to maintain their control over the church in contests with kings and emperors, it would be useful to see what happened when a pope rallied common Christians to a religious cause as a test of faith.

教皇没有军队，当教会政策上的 分歧导致与欧洲诸侯的武装冲突时，他们往往不得不依靠不可靠的贵族来保护。如果他们想在与国王 和皇帝的竞争中保持对教会的控制，那么看看当教皇将普通基督徒召集到宗教事业上以考验信仰时会 发生什么，将会很有用。

But the idea of fighting a war against other religions was outside the boundaries of classical Christian thinking. The Christian view of violence was that it should be as limited as possible and justified as defensive. The Crusades made that technical definition problematic, and the earlier notion of crusade expanded to include Muslim kingdoms in Spain or elsewhere, non-Christian settlements in Europe, and even the domains of the pope’s political enemies in Europe. The result of the Crusades was a belief that warfare on behalf of God, even if it was neither defensive nor approved by the people, was a “just war.”

但与其他宗教进行战争的想法, 超出了古典基督教思想的范 围。基督教对暴力的看法是，它应该尽可能受到限制，并作为防御性的合理性。十字军东征使这一技 术定义产生了问题，早期十字军东征的概念扩大到包括西班牙或其他地方的穆斯林王国、欧洲的非基 督教定居点，甚至欧洲教皇政敌的领地。十字军东征的结果是人们相信，代表上帝的战争，即使它既 不是防御性的，也没有得到人民的认可，也是一场“正义的战争”。 There were no newspapers, radio, television, billboards, or social media to promote the Crusades. Preachers needed to speak over and over to multiple crowds and stir the individuals in them to join. To do so, they relied on several tactics to inspire anger, fear, or fervor.

没有报纸、广播、电视、广告牌或社交媒体来宣传十字军东征。传教士需要一遍又一遍地向 多个人群演讲，并激励其中的人加入。为此，他们采用了多种策略来激发愤怒、恐惧或热 情。

We do not have an exact copy of Urban’s speech in Clermont that launched the First Crusade, but others grafted their own ideas onto what they had heard, what others said they had heard, or what some people thought Urban should have said.

我们没有乌尔班在克莱蒙发动第一次十字军东征的演讲的精确副本，但其他人将自己的想法 移植到他们所听到的、其他人说他们听到的或一些人认为乌尔班应该说的话上。

reality was more complicated. Commoners (even poor ones), women, the sick, and the elderly all joined alongside knights, and powerful nobles also answered the call. Many sacrificed their own land and property to gain the resources needed to join the crusading movement. The trek to Constantinople alone was arduous, with few amenities or roads to guide the way. Some may have hoped to gain land if they remained in the Holy Land, and others were motivated simply to see the earthly Jerusalem as a way of experiencing the heavenly Jerusalem that awaited them when they died, and then returned home.

尽管一些历史学家推测，狂热参加十字军东征的只是贵族的小儿子，那些无法从父辈那里继承任何东 西的人，但事实更为复杂。平民（甚至是穷人）、妇女、病人和老人都与骑士一起加入，强大的贵族 也响应了号召。许多人牺牲了自己的土地和财产来获得加入十字军运动所需的资源。仅前往君士坦丁 堡的长途跋涉就很艰辛，几乎没有便利设施或道路可以指引道路。有些人可能希望如果留在圣地，就 能获得土地，而另一些人的动机只是为了将地上的耶路撒冷视为一种体验天上耶路撒冷的方式，天上 的耶路撒冷在他们死后等待着他们，然后返回家园。

Others had less altruistic motives. Crusaders extorted bribes from Jewish communities to leave them in peace. Even those whose motivations were clearly religious, like Peter the Hermit, compelled German Jewish people to render supplies for their crusading bands. Although the church condemned violence, the Crusades mark the beginning of precarious times for Jewish communities in Christian Europe, when they were subject to abuse, expulsion, and sudden violence.

其他人则没有那么利他的动机。十字军向犹太社区勒索贿赂，以使他们享有和平。即使是那些有着明显 宗教动机的人，比如隐士彼得，也迫使德国犹太人为他们的十字军提供物资。尽管教会谴责暴力，但 十字军东征标志着基督教欧洲犹太社区不稳定时期的开始，当时他们遭受虐待、驱逐和突然的暴力。

Unlike classical Christianity, Islam from its earliest days had a concept of holy war called jihad. Jihad, meaning “struggle” in Arabic, can have different meanings or uses.

与古典基督教不同，伊斯兰教从早期就有一个称为圣战的圣战概念。圣战在阿拉伯语中的意思是“斗 争”，可以有不同的含义或用途。

According to Islam, Jewish people and Christians should be tolerated because they are monotheistic. In most instances, though, the idea of endeavoring to realize the will of God meant that armed conflict and conquest were also options. A ruler who was not concerned with striving against non-Muslims was viewed as failing in his duties. Similar ideas began to color Christian views of their own conflicts with Islam, especially in places like Spain. One such thought was that territories that had once been Christian should always belong to Christians, and this was considered particularly true of the Holy Land, even though the area was significant to Muslims and Jewish people as well.

根据伊斯兰教，犹太人和基督徒应该被容忍，因为他们是一神论者。然而，在大多数情况下，努力实 现上帝旨意的想法意味着武装冲突和征服也是选择。一个不关心与非穆斯林斗争的统治者被视为没有 履行职责。类似的想法开始影响基督徒对自己与伊斯兰教冲突的看法，尤其是在西班牙等地。其中一 种想法是，曾经是基督教的领土应该永远属于基督徒，这对于圣地来说尤其如此，尽管该地区对穆斯 林和犹太人也很重要。(零和博弈)

Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all have a concept of pilgrimage. Sacred journeys can be undertaken to enhance a person’s connection with God, as an act of penance, or in gratitude.

犹太教、基督教、伊斯兰教都有朝圣的概念。神圣的旅程可以用来增强一个人与上帝的联系，作为一 种忏悔或感恩的行为。

Jerusalem drew pilgrims from the three monotheistic religions. Pilgrimage had been obligatory for Jewish people until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, but even after that time, the city continued to play a special role in Jewish life. In the earliest decades of the first century, it had also become the location for some of the most dramatic and important scenes in the life of Jesus and the early Christian community. In the time of Constantine, a church had been built over the site of what was believed to be Jesus’s tomb, called the Holy Sepulchre. As the place where it is believed Jesus was crucified and resurrected, Jerusalem was bound up with the most essential Christian beliefs. Even in the ancient world, Christians undertook pilgrimages to this holiest of cities.

耶路撒冷吸引了来自三种一神教的朝圣者。在公元 70 年第二圣殿被毁之前，朝圣一直是犹太人的义 务，但即使在那之后，这座城市仍然在犹太人的生活中继续发挥着特殊的作用。在一世纪最初的几十 年里，它也成为耶稣和早期基督教社区生活中一些最戏剧性和最重要的场景的发生地。在君士坦丁时 代，在被认为是耶稣坟墓的地方建造了一座教堂，称为圣墓。作为耶稣被钉十字架和复活的地方，耶 路撒冷与最基本的基督教信仰息息相关。即使在古代世界，基督徒也会前往这座最神圣的城市朝圣.

Mecca is the holiest city in Islam and the site of the annual pilgrimage called the hajj. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on the old Temple Mount in Jerusalem, is the third holiest site in the faith, and it is believed to be mentioned several times in the Quran as “the furthest shrine.” Muhammad is said to have made a special journey to be able to pray in Jerusalem and to be allowed to glimpse God before he continued his mission to convert others to Islam. Another shrine, called the Dome of the Rock, was also built near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is associated with Muhammad’s journey and with the biblical Abraham, an important figure to Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike. Jerusalem, then, was a city unlike others in its spiritual appeal to people of different faiths. 麦加是伊斯兰教最神圣的城市，也是每年朝觐的地点。阿克萨清真寺建在耶路撒冷 旧圣殿山上，是信仰的第三圣地，据信《古兰经》多次提到它是“最遥远的圣地”。据说穆罕默德在继续 其使他人皈依伊斯兰教的使命之前，进行了一次特殊的旅程，以便能够在耶路撒冷祈祷并能够一睹真 主的风采。另一个被称为圆顶清真寺的圣殿也建在阿克萨清真寺附近，这座清真寺与穆罕默德的旅程 和圣经中的亚伯拉罕有关，亚伯拉罕是穆斯林、基督徒和犹太人的重要人物。因此，耶路撒冷是一座 与其他城市不同的城市，它对不同信仰的人们具有精神吸引力。

Historians have categorized the different crusades for convenience and to distinguish between various developments within the crusading movement. The Crusades were rarely well organized, however. During the First Crusade, the followers of Peter the Hermit arrived in Constantinople first. They did not wait for other groups to arrive and were ferried over to Anatolia (the Asian part of today’s Turkey) by Alexios, the Byzantine ruler. The Turks destroyed this army, and very few survived to return to Constantinople. Later crusaders understood that gathering intelligence in Constantinople was crucial to avoiding Peter’s fate.

历史学家对不同的十字军东征进行了分类，以方便区分十字军东征运动的各种发展 （图13.19 ）。然而，十字军东征很少组织得很好. 第一次十字军东征期间，隐士彼得的追随者首先到达君士坦丁堡。他们没有等 待其他团体到达，就被拜占庭统治者阿莱克修斯运送到安纳托利亚（今天土耳其的亚洲部分）。土耳 其人摧毁了这支军队，很少有人幸存返回君士坦丁堡。后来的十字军明白，在君士坦丁堡收集情报对 于避免彼得的命运至关重要。

早期十字军东征的路线。第一次至第四次十字军东征都面临着后勤和其他方面的挑战，并取得了不同程度的成功。

image:/img/0022.jpg[,100%]

The bulk of the First Crusade was directed by powerful aristocrats whose armies were better organized than Peter’s, even if most of its participants were not the most senior nobles of Western society. Alexios promised them aid in exchange for the return of Byzantine territory held by Muslims, which most initially agreed to. The crusaders crossed Anatolia and, after laying a bloody siege with little help from the Byzantines, took control of the port of Antioch, an ancient seat of Christianity in the Holy Land. After their victory, they felt Alexios was undeserving of either the city or their fidelity. The city was thus given to a Norman crusader who had no intention of delivering it to Alexios, straining the relationships between the crusaders and the Byzantine Empire.

第一次十字军东征的大部分由强大的贵族指挥，他们的军队比彼得的军队组织得更好，尽管大多数参与者并不是西方社会最高级的贵族。阿莱克修斯向他们承诺提供援助，以换取归还 穆斯林占领的拜占庭领土，大多数人最初都同意了。十字军穿越安纳托利亚，在拜占庭人几乎没有帮 助的情况下进行了血腥围攻后，控制了安条克港，这是圣地基督教的古老所在地。胜利后，他们觉得 阿莱克修斯不值得这座城市，也不值得他们的忠诚。因此，这座城市被交给了一位诺曼十字军，但他 无意将其交给阿莱克修斯，这使得十字军与拜占庭帝国之间的关系变得紧张。

The First Crusade finally reached Jerusalem in the summer of 1099. The crusaders then took the city, and in an act that shocked Muslims and Christians alike, they massacred the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants. The crusading armies then took other important cities in the area, and to secure their control they established the four Crusader States: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. These Crusader States were also called Outremer (literally “overseas”) by the French, and they claimed Jerusalem as their capital. Of all the Crusades, this was the only one that accomplished its objective.

第一次十字军终于在 1099 年夏天到达耶路撒冷。十字军随后占领了这座城市，他们屠杀了穆斯林和 犹太居民，此举震惊了穆斯林和基督徒。。随后十字军占领了该地区的其他重要城市，为了确保控制 权，他们建立了四个十字军国家：埃德萨郡、安条克公国、的黎波里郡和耶路撒冷王国。这些十字军 国家也被法国人称为Outremer （字面意思是“海外”），并声称耶路撒冷为首都（图13.20 ）。在所有 的十字军东征中，这是唯一一次实现了其目标的十字军东征。

image:/img/0023.jpg[,100%]

Despite the surprising success of the First Crusade, Outremer suffered some critical problems from the beginning. The crusaders had alienated the Byzantine Empire by not returning to it important cities like Antioch or lands in the Middle East as they had promised. The European aristocrats and knights were eager to acquire lands for themselves.

尽管第一次十字军东征取得了令人惊讶的成功，但海外之地从一开始就遇到了一些严重的问题。十字 军没有按照承诺归还安条克等重要城市或中东土地，从而疏远了拜占庭帝国。欧洲的贵族和骑士渴望 为自己获得土地.

The Muslims adapted quickly, however. A Turkic aristocrat named Imad al-Din Zengi managed to take the city of Edessa, in the northernmost of the Crusader States. The loss of Edessa posed a serious threat to the remaining Crusader States, however, and prompted the pope to call the Second Crusade.

然而，穆斯林很快就适应了，一位名 叫伊马德·丁·曾吉（Imad al-Din Zengi）的突厥贵族成功占领了位于十字军国家最北 端的埃德萨市。埃德萨的 丧失对剩余的十字军国家构成了严重威胁，并促使教皇召开了第二次十字军东征。

The Second Crusade, from 1147 to 1149, was heralded by a new generation of preachers like Bernard of Clairvaux who inspired believers to “take up the cross.” Bernard also wrote the rules for the Knights Templar, one of the new crusading orders, religious orders of monks devoted to protecting Christian pilgrims and fighting to support Outremer. This crusade was led by powerful rulers, including King Louis VII of France and King Conrad III of Germany (Figure 13.21). The armies of the Second Crusade were defeated in Anatolia in separate battles, and few soldiers reached the Holy Land. The kings accomplished very little, and many blamed the Byzantine emperor, who had learned to be distrustful of European armies.

1147 年至 1149 年的第二次十字军东征是由克莱尔沃的伯纳德 (Bernard of Clairvaux)等新一代传教士 发起的，他激励信徒“背起十字架”。伯纳德还为圣殿骑士团制定了规则，圣殿骑士团是新的十字军骑士 团之一，是致力于保护基督教朝圣者并为支持海外领土而战的僧侣宗教团体。这次十字军东征是由强 大的统治者领导的，其中包括法国国王路易七世和德国国王康拉德三世（图13.21 ）。第二次十字军东 征的军队在安纳托利亚的多次战斗中被击败，很少有士兵到达圣地。国王们几乎没有取得什么成就， 许多人指责拜占庭皇帝，因为他已经学会了对欧洲军队的不信任。

After this loss, the situation for Outremer only became more dire. Imad al-Din Zengi’s successors were well liked, even by crusaders, and they strove to unite the Muslim princes in jihad. The most famous of these successors was Salah al-Din, or Saladin in the Christian world. He was known for being humane, fair-minded, and, in Christians terms, chivalrous. In 1187, after years of gathering allies and eroding the military power of Outremer, he destroyed the crusaders at the Battle of the Horns of Hattin (in today’s Israel). Within months, Jerusalem fell to Saladin.

这次失利之后，Outremer的处境变得更加严峻。伊马德·丁·赞吉的继任者很受欢迎，甚至受到十字军的 喜爱，他们努力团结穆斯林王子进行圣战。这些继任者中最著名的是萨拉丁（Salah al-Din），即基督 教世界的萨拉丁。他以仁慈、公正、用基督徒的话来说，具有侠义精神而闻名. 1187 年，经过多年聚集盟友并削弱海外的军事力量，他在哈丁角战役（位 于今天的以色列）消灭了十字军。几个月之内，耶路撒冷落入萨拉丁之手。

The Christians’ response was the Third Crusade (1189–1192). This crusade was prompted both by the fear that Outremer was about to be wiped off the map and by the desire to retake Jerusalem. Kings from England, the Holy Roman Empire, and France as well as other powerful princes answered the call. When they arrived in the last remaining Christian outposts in the Middle East, they quickly fell to squabbling with each other and the aristocracy of Outremer. As a result, the Christians were able to conquer the island of Cyprus and the coastline of the Holy Land but were unable to move farther inland. Eventually, Richard I of England, known in popular stories as Richard the Lionhearted, negotiated a treaty with Saladin that left Jerusalem under Muslim control but allowed Christian pilgrims to freely visit the city. Both Saladin and Richard were praised as examples of chivalric virtue in Europe and heroes of their respective religions. But this was one of the last successes the crusaders were to have in the Holy Land.

基督徒的回应是第三次十字军东征（1189-1192）。这次十字军东征的动机既有对海外领土即将从地图 上消失的恐惧，也有夺回耶路撒冷的愿望。来自英格兰、神圣罗马帝国和法国的国王以及其他强大的 王子响应了这一号召。当他们到达中东仅存的基督教前哨基地时，他们很快就陷入了彼此之间以及海 外贵族的争吵之中。结果，基督徒能够征服塞浦路斯岛和圣地的海岸线，但无法进一步向内陆移动。 最终，英国的理查一世（在流行故事中被称为狮心王理查）与萨拉丁谈判达成一项条约，将耶路撒冷 置于穆斯林控制之下，但允许基督教朝圣者自由访问这座城市。萨拉丁和理查都被誉为欧洲骑士美德 的典范和各自宗教的英雄。但这是十字军在圣地取得的最后胜利之一。

European Catholics also found in the conquered areas native Christian populations with a variety of different creeds. The Christians of the Middle East had also been acculturated by centuries of living under Muslim rule, which meant the Christianity of the east looked very different from that practiced in Europe. The Greek Orthodox Byzantines were unhappy with the establishment of a wellorganized religious rival in the Holy Land. Many native communities distrusted the crusaders not because they were of a different religion but because they arrived with brutality and did not share the cultural practices of the area.

欧洲天主教徒还在被征服地区发现了有着各种不同信仰的本土基督徒。。中东的基督徒也已经在穆斯林统治下生活了几个世纪， 这意味着东方的基督教看起来与欧洲的基督教有很大不同。希腊东正教拜占庭人对在圣地建立 一个组织严密的宗教对手感到不满。许多原住民社区不信任十字军，不是因为他们信仰不同的宗教， 而是因为他们残忍地到来，并且不认同该地区的文化习俗。

Despite the initial violence by crusaders that scarred and scattered some Jewish and Muslim communities, policies of toleration and protection emerged. These had less to do with the crusaders’ growing familiarity with the religious and ethnic groups in Outremer and more to do with the lack of settlers from Europe. Lords needed workers, and if they could not be had, then native communities had to be preserved, not brutalized.

尽管十字军最初的暴力行为使一些犹太和穆斯林社区伤痕累累并四散，但宽容和保护的政策出现了。 这些与十字军对海外地区宗教和种族群体的日益熟悉关系不大，而更多地与缺乏来自欧洲的定居者有 关。领主需要工人，如果没有工人，那么土著社区就必须得到保护，而不是被残酷对待。

The crusaders organized their government in feudal terms, but the native populations never became serfs owing service to their lords. Instead, they paid their taxes in cash or in goods.

十字军以封建形式组织政府，但当地居民从未因为领主服务而成为农奴。相反，他们以现金或货物缴 纳税款。

The lack of settlers from Europe ensured that the number of soldiers in Outremer was small. This was why the crusaders built imposing fortresses and castles, like the famous Krak des Chevaliers in Syria. Many crusaders' expectation was that they would return home, and many pilgrims and crusaders did so rather than settling in the Holy Land.

由于缺乏来自欧洲的定居者，海外地区的士兵数量很少。这就是为什么十字军建造了气势磅礴的堡垒和城堡，比如叙利亚著名的骑士堡. 许多十字军战士的期望往往是返回家园，，而许多朝圣者和十字军战士却这样做了, 而不是 在圣地定居。

The crusading movement continued after the Third Crusade, but enthusiasm waned. Pope Innocent III, one of the most powerful medieval popes, called for a new crusade in 1202. The crusaders wanted to avoid the overland routes through Anatolia that had been a problem from the start. They hoped to avoid the Byzantine Empire too, because tensions between crusader leaders and the Byzantine emperors had been worsened by religious conflict and accusations of betrayal. These crusaders ordered ships from Italian cities to carry them directly to the Holy Land. In return, the Venetian leader asked the crusaders to attack a port city named Zara on the Dalmatian coast, which was Christian but Venice’s rival. When the crusaders agreed, the pope was furious and excommunicated them.

第三次十字军东征后，十字军运动仍在继续，但热情减退。中世纪最有权势的教皇之一教皇英诺森三 世于 1202 年呼吁发动新的十字军东征。十字军希望避开穿越安纳托利亚的陆路路线，这从一开始就是 一个问题。他们也希望避开拜占庭帝国，因为宗教冲突和背叛指控加剧了十字军领袖和拜占庭皇帝之 间的紧张关系。这些十字军命令来自意大利城市的船只将他们直接运送到圣地。作为回报，威尼斯领 导人要求十字军进攻达尔马提亚海岸上一个名叫扎拉的港口城市，该城市是基督教城市，但却是威尼 斯的竞争对手。当十字军同意后，教皇勃然大怒，将他们逐出教会。

The crusaders continued to Constantinople, where they became involved in the internal politics of the Byzantine Empire and attacked the city, sacking it. While the Catholics established the short-lived Latin Empire of Constantinople, considerable damage had been done to the crusading movement and to relations between the Greek Orthodox and Catholic churches.

十字军继续前往君士坦丁堡，在那里他们参与了拜占庭帝国的内部政治，并袭击了这座城市，将其洗劫一空，试图让亲十字军的皇帝登上王位。虽然天主教徒建立了 短命的君士坦丁堡拉丁帝国，但十字军运动以及希腊东正教和天主教会之间的关系受到了相当大的损 害。

Later calls for crusades were met with some enthusiasm, but the object of the fight became Egypt, recognized as an important base for controlling the Holy Land. Nevertheless, later crusades became increasingly French and less successful at accomplishing their goals, at least as far as establishing Christian control of the Holy Land went. The French crusader-king Louis IX led the Seventh and Eighth Crusades against Muslim rulers in North Africa and died of illness there. (He was later canonized as St. Louis.) When the port city of Acre in present-day Israel fell in 1291, the last of the Crusader States fell with it.

后来十字军东征的呼声得到了一些热情，但战斗的对象却变成了埃及，被认为是控制圣地的重要基 地。然而，后来的十字军东征越来越法国化，并且在实现其目标方面不太成功，至少在建立基督教对 圣地的控制方面是这样。法国十字军国王路易九世领导了第七次和第八次十字军东征，对抗北非的穆 斯林统治者，并在那里病逝。 （他后来被封为圣路易斯。）1291 年，当今天以色列的港口城市阿卡陷 落时，最后一个十字军国家也随之陷落。

The crusading ideal was also transformed by practice and experience. The popes now called holy wars not just to liberate Jerusalem but to fight against the enemies of the church. Crusades were called against non-Christians in the Baltic regions, against heretics in France, and even against the pope’s personal enemies in Italy (Figure 13.23). Crusaders came to expect standard privileges like the indulgence, a means to reduce the penance owed for sinning by giving money directly to the church or paying for masses or other clerical services.

The popes frequently called on Christian knights and aristocrats to fight against Muslims in a conflict that now seemed to be waged everywhere, not just in the Middle East, and against non-Christians of all types.

The image of Muslims and Jewish people as perennial enemies of Christian culture that developed in the crusading era had a lasting negative impact in Europe and elsewhere, even to the present day.

十字军理想也因实践和经验而改变。教皇现在称圣战不仅是为了解放耶路撒冷，也是为了对抗教会的 敌人。十字军东征的目标是波罗的海地区的非基督徒，法国的异端，甚至意大利的教皇的私人敌人 。十字军开始期待像赎罪券这样的标准特权，这是一种通过直接向教堂捐钱或支付弥撒或 其他文书服务来减少因犯罪而应受的忏悔的手段。教皇经常号召基督教骑士和贵族在这场冲突中与穆斯林作战，这场冲突现在似乎不仅在中东，而 且还针对所有类型的非基督徒。十字军时代形成的穆斯林和犹太人作为基督教文化的长期敌人的形象对欧洲和其他地方产生了 持久的负面影响，甚至直到今天。

Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the crusading ideal declined in popularity. This was due in part to the decline of the power of the papacy and in part to the revival of royal power in the fourteenth century. The Crusades had been launched by popular popes. Over time, they came to seem more concerned about their own power and prestige and less like the hard-working clerics who had battled kings for the freedom of the church. In the early fourteenth century, the king of France accused the Knights Templar, one of the more popular crusading orders, of committing crimes such as blasphemy and apostasy (the rejection of Christianity). The order’s leaders were executed as heretics, and the popes disbanded the order, largely to please the French king. 中世纪末期，十字军理想不再受欢迎。这部分是由于教皇权力的衰落，部分是由于十四世纪王权的复 兴。十字军东征是由教皇发动的。随着时间的推移，他们似乎越 来越关心自己的权力和威望，不再像那些为教会自由而与国王作战的辛勤工作的神职人员。十四世纪 初，法国国王指控圣殿骑士团（较受欢迎的十字军骑士团之一）犯有亵渎和叛教（拒绝基督教）等罪 行。该骑士团的领导人被作为异端分子处决，教皇解散了该骑士团，主要是为了取悦法国国王。
