In the 1400s, Japan was locked in what seemed to be unending internal strife. The Ashikaga
shoguns (military overlords) who supposedly ruled the country were too weak to prevent their vassals
from fighting one another.  Powerful samurai began to style themselves daimyos (“great lords”) and ruled
their territories as if they were independent kingdoms; they imposed their own laws, collected tolls
from those who entered, and recruited warriors loyal only to them, instead of to the shogun or the
emperor. From this period of chaos emerged a succession of three powerful samurai who came to
be known as “the three unifiers.” Beginning in the 1560s, Oda Nobunaga began to unite Japan under
his rule. He was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.

1400 年代，日本陷入似乎永无止境的内乱之中。据称统治该国的足利将军（军事霸主）太弱了，无法
阻止其封臣相互争斗. 强大的武士开
始自称为大名（“伟大的领主”），并像独立王国一样统治他们的领土。他们制定自己的法律，向进入者
收取通行费，并招募只忠于他们而不是幕府将军或皇帝的武士。从这个混乱时期出现了三位强大的武
士，他们被称为“三统一者”。从1560年代开始，织田信长开始统一日本. 他的继任者是丰臣秀吉和德
川家康。

In 1543, Portuguese ships arrived in Japan. It was the logical end point of a route that had taken
them around the coast of Africa, eastward through the Indian Ocean, and into the Pacific. They
wished to trade. They also wished to win converts for the Roman Catholic Church, as they had done
elsewhere in Asia. The Portuguese were soon followed by the Spanish in 1549, and on the heels of
the Portuguese and Spanish came the Dutch and the English. These last two nations, however, were
less interested in religion than in profit.

1543年，葡萄牙船只抵达日本。这是他们绕过非洲海岸，向东穿过印度洋，进入太平洋的路线的逻辑
终点。他们希望进行贸易。他们还希望为罗马天主教会赢得皈依者，就像他们在亚洲其他地方所做的
那样。 1549 年，西班牙人紧随葡萄牙人之后而来，紧接着葡萄牙人和西班牙人之后又出现了荷兰人和
英国人。然而，最后两个国家对宗教的兴趣不如对利润的兴趣。


Nagasaki, on the southern
island of Kyushu, was the most Christianized community in Japan.

长崎位于九州岛南
部，是日本基督教化程度最高的社区。

Many daimyos became Christian or offered the
missionaries support in an effort to obtain weapons and gunpowder to assist them in their battles
with rival samurai.

许多大名成为基督徒或向传教士提供支
持，以获取武器和火药，以协助他们与敌对武士作战。


Oda Nobunaga made use of this new style of fighting. In 1575, at the Battle of Nagashino,
he and his vassal Tokugawa Ieyasu used companies of samurai armed with European guns to defeat
the warriors of the Takeda clan.

织田信长运用了这种新的战斗方
式。 1575年，在长筱之战中，他和他的封臣德川家康使用装备欧洲枪支的武士连队击败了武田氏族的
武士。


By 1590, Hideyoshi had defeated all the daimyos in Japan and required that
they declare their loyalty to him. He disarmed non-samurai and forbade peasants to leave the land
or become soldiers, while also forbidding samurai to take up any occupation other than war.


到了1590年，秀吉已经击败了日本所有
的大名，并要求他们宣誓效忠他。他解除了非武士的武装，禁止农民离开土地或成为士兵，同时也禁
止武士从事战争以外的任何职业。


Unlike Oda Nobunaga, who had been relatively unconcerned with the activities of Christians,
Hideyoshi was more suspicious of them.  In 1587, Hideyoshi
ordered Christian missionaries to leave Japan. The edict was not enforced, but the Jesuits, alarmed,
asked Christian daimyos to help them attack the shogun, which they refused to do. In 1590, the
Jesuits in Japan resolved instead to refrain from intervening in Japanese affairs, but they secretly
continued to provide funds for Christian daimyos.



与对基督徒的活动相对不关心的织田信长不同，秀吉对他们更加怀疑。1587年，秀吉命令基督教传教士离开日本。该法令没有得到执行，但耶稣
会士感到震惊，要求基督教大名帮助他们攻击幕府将军，但他们拒绝这样做。 1590年，日本耶稣会士
决定不再干预日本事务，但暗中继续为基督教大名提供资金。

Neither approach was completely successful in avoiding Hideyoshi’s ire.

这两种方法都未能完全成功地避免秀吉的愤怒。

Fearing that the Spanish intended to conquer Japan and planned to seek
assistance from Japanese Christians, Hideyoshi ordered the arrest of the missionaries who had
remained in Japan in violation of his 1587 decree.

由于担心西
班牙人意图征服日本并计划向日本基督徒寻求援助，秀吉违反了1587年的法令，下令逮捕留在日本的
传教士。


In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered Christian missionaries to leave Japan. Note the various reasons
he gives for expelling the missionaries.

1587年，丰臣秀吉命令基督教传教士离开日本。请注意他给出的驱逐传教士的各种理由。

When a vassal receives a province, a district, a village, or another form of a fief, he
must consider it as a property entrusted to him on a temporary basis. However, some vassals illegally
[commend part of their fiefs to the church]. This is a culpable offense.

当封臣获得省份、地区、村庄或其他形式的封地时，他必须
将其视为临时委托给他的财产。然而，一
些封臣非法地[将其部分封地赠予教会]。


In 1598 he died, leaving his five-year-old son Hideyori to inherit
his position. However, the five-member council that was to rule until Hideyori came of age was soon
divided, and the two sides made war upon each other. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu, a vassal of
Hideyoshi, defeated his opponents at the Battle of Sekigahara, and he became shogun
in 1603.

1598年他(丰臣秀吉)去世，五岁的儿子秀赖继承了他的职位。然而，一直统治到
秀赖成年为止的五人议会很快就分裂了，双方爆发了战争。 1600年，秀吉的家臣德川家康在关原之战
中击败对手，并于1603年成为将军。

the 1600 Battle of Sekigahara:  +
Approximately 160,000 samurai clashed over a period of six hours.

1600 年的关原之战。大约 16 万名武士在六个小时内发生冲突。

To consolidate power, Tokugawa Ieyasu rewarded loyal daimyos with gifts of land. He allocated 15
percent of Japan’s richest rice-producing land to himself and his heirs. The next-best land, about
half of that available, was given to his “inside daimyos,” samurai who were related to him or who had
declared their loyalty before the Battle of Sekigahara. The remaining land, less fertile or farthest
away from the new capital of Edo (modern-day Tokyo), was given to the “outside daimyos,” samurai
clans that had proclaimed loyalty only after his victory or that had fought against him. Ieyasu
prohibited daimyos from forming alliances, including marriages, without his approval. He also
required them to spend every other year in Edo, where it would be more difficult for them to
formulate rebellion.

为了巩固权力，德川家康向忠诚的大名赠送土地作为礼物。他将日本最富饶的稻米生产地的 15% 分配
给了他自己和他的继承人。第二好的土地，大约一半的可用土地，被给予他的“内部大名”，即与他有亲
戚关系或在关原之战前宣布效忠的武士。剩下的土地，肥沃程度较差或距离新首都江户（现在的东
京）最远，被给予“外部大名”，即在他胜利后才宣誓效忠或曾与他作战的武士氏族。家康禁止大名在未
经他批准的情况下结成联盟，包括婚姻。他还要求他们每隔一年在江户度过一次，在那里他们更难策
划叛乱。

Like Hideyoshi, Ieyasu also feared that Christians posed a threat to Japan.  He
also feared that by adopting the foreign faith, he would give disloyal daimyos opportunities to
conspire against him.

和秀吉一样，家康也担心基督徒对日本构成威胁. 他还担心，通
过接受外国信仰，他会给不忠诚的大名提供密谋反对他的机会。

In 1614, Ieyasu outlawed the practice of Christianity and ordered missionaries to leave the country.
Japanese Christians were warned that if they did not renounce their faith, they would be killed. It
was clear to Ieyasu that the best way to keep Christian influence out
of the country was to ban the entry of foreigners and forbid Japanese to leave.

1614 年，家康宣布基督教信仰为非法，并命令传教士离开该国 (目的是为了杜绝基督教对日本统治阶层的影响)。日本基督徒被警告说，如果他们不放
弃信仰，就会被杀害。家康很清楚，将基督教影响力拒之门外的最佳方法是禁止外国
人入境并禁止日本人离开。

Preventing Japanese
from leaving the country would also keep daimyos from conspiring against him in foreign lands.

阻止日本人离开这个国家也可以防止大名在外国密谋反对他。


In 1624, the Spanish were banned from entering Japan. In 1639, Ieyasu prohibited the entry of the
Portuguese. The Dutch, who had refrained from missionary activity, were still allowed to enter Japan
to trade. However, to limit any harmful influence on their part, Dutch merchants were confined to a
settlement on Dejima Island in the harbor of Nagasaki, in a walled compound they were not allowed
to leave. Only licensed trade officials and translators (a position that became hereditary) could have
contact with them. The English might have been extended the same rights, but finding trade with
Japan not as profitable as they had hoped, they no longer sent ships. Chinese merchants were also
still allowed to enter the country, but their trade was confined to Nagasaki, and they were forced to
live in a special Chinese enclave. In 1635, Japanese were forbidden to leave the country except on
special missions, like transacting trade with Korea, China, and Russia.

1624年，西班牙人被禁止进入日本。 1639年，家康禁止葡萄牙人入境。荷兰人虽然不再进行传教活
动，但仍然被允许进入日本进行贸易。然而，为了限制对他们造成的有害影响，荷兰商人被限制在长
崎港出岛的一个定居点内，在一个有围墙的院落里，他们不准离开。  只有获得许可的贸易官员和翻译
（这一职位后来成为世袭的）才能与他们接触。英国人可能获得了同样的权利，但发现与日本的贸易
并不像他们希望的那样有利可图，因此他们不再派遣船只。中国商人也仍然被允许进入该国，但他们
的贸易仅限于长崎，而且他们被迫居住在一个特殊的中国飞地。 1635 年，日本人被禁止出境，除非执
行特殊任务，例如与韩国、中国和俄罗斯进行贸易。


“Dutch
learning,” knowledge gained from the Dutch on Dejima, played an important part in Japanese life in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

In the early eighteenth century, prohibitions
on books were relaxed, and works on medicine, science, and geography were translated. Thus,
“Dutch learning” provided a foundation for Japanese scientific and technological development and
kept people informed of what was happening in Europe.

但“荷兰学习”，即从出岛荷兰人获得的知识，在 17
世纪和 18 世纪的日本人生活中发挥了重要作用。十八世纪初，书籍禁令放松，医学、
科学和地理方面的著作被翻译。因此，“荷兰学习”为日本科技发展奠定了基础，让人们了解欧洲正在发
生的事情
