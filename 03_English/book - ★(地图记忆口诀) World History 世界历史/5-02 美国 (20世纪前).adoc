Europeans were occasionally victims of their own success, as when economic imperialism inadvertently created societies strong enough to form independent nations that declared independence from the home country. In at least one case, thirteen former colonies formed a nation that became wealthier and more powerful than the empire that preceded it.

欧洲人偶尔也会成为自身成功的受害者，比如经济帝国主义不经意间创造了强大到足以形成独立国家的社会，宣布从母国独立出来。至少在一个案例中，13个前殖民地组成了一个比之前的大英帝国更富裕、更强大的国家。

'''

==  殖民地人民, 与母国英国的矛盾原因

=== (经济上 )母国对殖民地的经济剥削

==== 殖民地生产的产品, 只能卖给母国英国, 不能卖给其他出价更高的国家, 损害了殖民地人民的收入

In the second half of the seventeenth century, England passed a series of Navigation Acts designed to maximize profit from its colonies while denying their resources to other European powers and clamping down on efforts to avoid trade restrictions through smuggling.

The Navigation Act of 1660 listed goods produced in the colonies that could be sold only in England or to its colonial possessions. Thus, English merchants paid American colonists what the merchants thought their goods were worth; the colonists were forbidden to sell to Dutch, French, Spanish, or other merchants who might be willing to pay more. Among these products were furs, tobacco, and sugar, goods for which all of Europe yearned.

In addition, naval stores for building and maintaining ships for trade and war could be sent only to England. Once they arrived in England, these colonial products were heavily taxed, and the revenue went to the English government, not to the colonies that had produced them.

为了从殖民地获取最大利润，英国颁布了一系列航海法案:

- 殖民地生产的产品 (都是整个欧洲都渴望的刚需商品), 只能卖给母国英国, 和英国的其他殖民地. 不允许卖给其他能出价更高的国家, 这导致英国商人能对”殖民地人民的货”压价. 损害殖民地自身的利益.
- 用来制造军舰的材料, 只能出售给英国, 并且销售收入不归殖民地人民所有, 而归英国政府所有. 并且英国政府还要对这种贸易征重税. (那殖民地人民岂不是不但0收入? 还要亏本倒贴缴税?)

Parliament then granted the British East India Company a monopoly on the importation of tea, which angered colonial tea merchants and led to armed conflict, initiating the American Revolution in 1775.

英国议会随后授予”英国东印度公司”茶叶进口垄断权，此举激怒了殖民地茶商，引发了武装冲突，引发了 1775年的美国独立革命。

'''

==== 对所有运往殖民地的货物, 英国都要征税, 税收归英国所有, 而非殖民地所有.

To generate yet more income for the government, the Navigation Act of 1663 mandated that all goods bound for the colonies from outside the British Empire had first to be shipped to England and taxed before they could continue to their final destination. This provision increased the price to the colonists of non-English goods because foreign shippers passed the cost of the English taxes on to them.

为了给政府创造更多收入， 1663 年的《航海法》规定，所有从大英帝国以外运往殖民地的货物, 必须首先运往英国并缴税，然后才能继续前往最终目的地。这一条款提高了非英国商品对殖民者的价格，因为外国托运人会将英国税收的成本, 转嫁给殖民地人民。

'''

====  用不平等的商业竞争, 来压低殖民地的盈利能力.

At the end of the seventeenth century, Parliament also began to prohibit colonists from manufacturing certain goods that were also produced in England, to prevent them from underselling English merchants. Colonists could not sell goods made from wool or iron, either in England or to other English colonies. By allowing the colonists to export only the unfinished furs instead of the finished hats, for which they could have charged higher prices, Parliament limited the amount of wealth the settlers in the English colonies could acquire.

殖民地严禁生产英国拥有的某些商品 (相当于英国禁运了该商品的进口), 以防止殖民地和母国的商人抢生意, 减少母国商人的收入.

殖民地只能生产”半成品”, 不能生产”全部完工的商品”. 意思就是让殖民地只能赚低收入, 母国才能赚高收入.

'''

===  (经济上) 母国对”殖民地人民希望扩张耕地(到"阿巴拉契亚山脉"以西)”的限制

In the wake of the French and Indian War, British colonists in North America greeted with hostility other actions by Britain’s Parliament that they believed unfairly restricted their economic opportunities.

Many had longed to move west of the Appalachian Mountains to establish farms on the rich lands of the Ohio Valley, for instance. New England families were large, and with each generation, parents found it difficult to provide sufficient land for their children. In the southern colonies, the demands of tobacco farming meant that new, fertile land was always in demand. Many colonies claimed territories west of the Appalachians, but this land had been taken by the French and was inhabited by their numerous Native American allies.

With the British victory over the French and their Indigenous allies, the colonists looked forward to finally claiming it. The British government, however, wishing to avoid antagonizing the tribes of the Ohio Valley and seeking to avoid costly new wars, promptly prohibited settlement west of the Appalachians, to the dismay and anger of many colonists who had fought alongside British troops in the recently ended conflict.

由于在"新英格兰"定居的家庭, 子女众多. 因此父母发现, 无法为子女提供足够的耕种土地。殖民地人民就想到"阿巴拉契亚山脉"以西去开拓新土地. 但那里是被法国人占据的, 并且还有法国的众多原住民盟友.

不过, 在七年战争中, 英国打败了法国. 殖民地人民又希望能获取那里的土地. 但英国为了避免引发新的战争, 禁止殖民地人民到"阿巴拉契亚山脉"以西的定居. 这让在七年战争中, 与英国并肩作战的殖民地人民, 感到沮丧和愤怒.

Britain’s Proclamation Line of 1763 declared the Appalachian Mountains the western settlement boundary for the thirteen North American colonies. Its goals were to prevent further conflict with the French and Native Americans there, and to avoid the costs of defending the frontier when Britain was already struggling with debt from the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763). The colonists, some of whom had already received land grants west of the Appalachians, viewed the edict as equivalent to tyranny and disregarded it.

英国在1763年发布公告, 宣布”阿巴拉契亚山脉” 作为北美十三个殖民地的西部定居点的边界. 英国的目的是: ①防止殖民地人, 与法国和美洲原住民发生进一步冲突. ② 英国在七年战争中的花费, 已经背负很多债务, 不想为了保卫北美殖民地的扩张边境, 而再多花钱. 但是, 殖民地人民中, 一些人已经获得了”阿巴拉契亚山脉”以西的土地,  认为该法令等同于暴政，因此无视它。

Proclamation Line of 1763. This map depicts the boundary Britain imposed on westward settlement of its North American colonies in 1763, to save costs and avoid conflict with Native Americans and the French. The colonists viewed it as yet another instance of the tyranny of the king.

1763 年公告线。该地图描绘了 1763 年英国为其北美殖民地向西定居所划定的边界，以节省成本, 并避免与美洲原住民和法国人发生冲突。殖民者将其视为国王暴政的又一实例。

===  (税收上) 殖民地需要更多缴税, 却用来养母国在殖民地的驻军

Furthermore, determined to keep the peace with Native Americans and repay war debts, the British kept troops in North America who policed the frontier, regulated colonial trade, and collected taxes. The need to pay for the army’s maintenance led to attempts to impose new taxes on the colonists or to more vigorously enforce the collection of already existing ones.

'''

===  (税收上) 已完成目的的税种, 却不取消

Tensions were further heightened by the imposition of taxes and commercial regulations. In particular, the Stamp Act of 1765 taxed legal documents and printed materials as a means of generating revenue for Britain, which led to widespread protests. North American colonists had paid taxes imposed by Parliament before, but the intent of those taxes had been to repay debts held by the government. Although this was also the original purpose of the Stamp Act, to pay debts accrued during the Seven Years’ War, the tax remained in place after the debt had been paid. This was the first time the colonists were expected to pay a tax intended solely to generate an ongoing source of revenue for the British government.

英国在北美推出《印花税法》, 目的是为了为七年战争中积累的债务, 筹资还债. 但这个债务还清后, 《印花税法》却不取消, 还在继续征收.

The Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 but merely replaced it with a variety of other taxes and duties that led to general turmoil in the colonies, especially in Boston.

后来, 议会废除了《印花税法》, 却换用其他税收和关税来代替前者, 继续征收.

'''

===  (司法上) 殖民地人民, 没有投票权, 来选出当地的议会成员  (因此 ”无代表, 不纳税”)

Furthermore, colonists were unable to vote for members of Parliament and thus had no representatives to consent to this taxation on their behalf.

殖民地人民无法投票来选出议会成员，因此没有"代理人"来代表他们同意这项征税。(因此 ”无代表, 就不纳税”)

Indeed, in the same year the Stamp Act was repealed, Parliament passed the Declaratory Act, which stated that it had absolute authority to impose taxes on the colonies and to regulate their affairs.

事实上，在《印花税法》被废除的同一年，议会却通过了《宣言法》，规定议会拥有向殖民地”征税”, 和”管理其事务”的绝对权力。

After Parliament took the extreme step of dispatching soldiers to Massachusetts to restore order and threatened customary liberties in the process, support in the colonies for a complete break with Britain intensified.

在议会采取极端措施，派遣士兵前往马萨诸塞州恢复秩序，并在此过程中威胁”传统自由”后，殖民地中要求与英国彻底决裂的呼声更加强烈。

'''

=== (司法上) 殖民地走私者, 在被审判时, 却不通过陪审团

Colonists’ efforts to evade trade restrictions by smuggling were countered with laws that required smugglers be tried in admiralty courts, which lacked a jury. Many colonists felt this practice violated protections guaranteed by the English Bill of Rights.

海事法庭没有陪审团。这种做法违反了英国《权利法案》中对人民的保障.

'''

===  (政治上) 母国直接将俄亥俄河谷授予魁北克管理, 这破坏了殖民地的自治传统.

The 1774 decision by Parliament to grant control of the Ohio Valley to the newly acquired French province of Quebec, to allow Quebec to continue to be governed by French civil law, and to extend religious toleration to the province’s Roman Catholics outraged British colonists, most of whom were Protestant.

This ruling, made at the same time as one that interfered with the century-and-a-half-long tradition of colonial self-government, led many colonists increasingly to regard Britain as hostile to their interests.


Growing resentment of British rule erupted in bloodshed in 1775 and a subsequent declaration of independence in 1776.

对英国统治日益增长的怨恨, 在1775年爆发流血冲突，随后在1776年宣布独立。

'''

==  美国<独立宣言> (1776)

As colonial societies warmed to the idea that political power should be based on the consent of the people, a growing dissatisfaction with the British Crown’s arbitrary rules and taxes propelled the colonies in North America toward revolution.

随着殖民地社会逐渐接受”政治权力应该建立在人民同意的基础上”的观念，对英国王室”专制统治”和”税收”的日益不满, 促使北美殖民地走向革命。

As the crisis escalated, revolutionary sentiment came to a head when the first and second Continental Congresses, assemblies of elected colonial representatives, met in Philadelphia in 1774 and 1775, respectively. The Second Continental Congress adopted the powers of government as a form of resistance to British tyranny and in 1776 approved the Declaration of Independence.

Although support for independence was not universal among the colonists, and a substantial minority remained neutral or actively supported the British, twelve of the thirteen colonies ultimately approved the Declaration of Independence, the only abstention being New York.

随着危机升级，革命情绪在第一次和第二次"大陆会议"期间达到高潮。这些会议分别于1774年和1775年在费城召开，由"殖民地选举代表"组成。第二次大陆会议通过了"将政府权力作为抵抗英国暴政"的一种形式，并于 1776 年批准了《独立宣言》 。

尽管殖民者并不普遍支持独立，并且有相当一部分人保持中立, 或积极支持英国，但十三个殖民地中有十二个最终批准了《独立宣言》，唯一弃权的是纽约。

The Declaration of Independence was modeled on Enlightenment principles of sovereignty and natural rights, particularly the social contract theory of the writer and philosopher John Locke.

《独立宣言》以启蒙运动的"主权"和"自然权利"原则为蓝本，特别是作家和哲学家约翰·洛克的"社会契约论"。

It may be tempting to see the American Revolution as a full-fledged victory for Enlightenment ideals of popular sovereignty and natural rights, but the actual application of these principles was spotty at best. Traditional narratives typically cite the love of liberty as its guiding principle and celebrate its democratic achievements, but its causes were far more complex.

British efforts to consolidate control over the colonies in the years leading up to the war incited resistance from colonists seeking to maintain their autonomy, but the war’s roots lay in a variety of economic, political, and ideological disputes.

- Colonial elites sought the same rights as their counterparts in Britain, and their demands to levy taxes themselves and their resistance to the Crown heavily influenced the initial desire for independence.
- Merchants, however, primarily sought economic freedoms that would release them from British trade restrictions and taxes.
- Still others resisted British attempts to curb westward expansion and appropriate Native American lands.

Ultimately, these diverse motives converged with growing popular protest and incited rebellions and violence, eventually leading to revolution.

人们可能很容易将美国革命, 视为启蒙思想中"人民主权"与"自然权利"理想的全面胜利，但这些原则在当时实际中的使用, 顶多是零散的。传统叙述通常将"对自由的追求"作为其指导原则，并赞扬其民主成就，但革命的真实起因, 远比这一单一解释要复杂得多。

战前几年，英国试图加强对殖民地的控制，激起了殖民者的反抗，他们希望维护自己的自治权，但战争的根源在于各种经济、政治, 和意识形态的争端。

- (上层精英想要的:) 殖民精英们, 寻求与母国人民享有同等的权利，他们对"自行征税"的要求, 和对国王的抵制, 深刻影响了最初的独立愿望。
- (商人想要的:) 然而，商人们主要追求经济自由，从而摆脱英国的贸易限制和税收。
- (土地开拓者想要的:) 还有一些人反对英国"试图遏制殖民地人民向西扩张, 以及夺取美洲原住民土地"的企图。

最终，这些不同的动机, 与日益增长的民众抗议相结合，激发了起义与暴力，最终导致了革命的爆发。(即美国独立战争的支持者中, 存在各种人的不同动机理由)

== 美国独立战争（American War of Independence，1775-1783）

In the military conflict that ensued, Britain initially won most of the battles, but the Continental Army led by General George Washington eventually prevailed, and the British surrendered at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. Some fighting continued until the fall of 1783, but peace was formally declared when representatives of the new United States and King George III of Great Britain signed the Treaty of Paris in September that year, officially ending the war.

在随后发生的军事冲突中，英国最初赢得了大部分战斗，但乔治·华盛顿将军领导的"大陆军"最终取得了胜利，英国人于 1781 年在弗吉尼亚州"约克镇"投降。一些战斗一直持续到 1783 年秋天，但同年9月，当新成立的美国的代表, 和英国国王乔治三世的代表, 签署了《巴黎条约》后 ，就正式宣布战争结束。

'''

==  <邦联条例> (第一部成文宪法, 1781),  <美国宪法> (1789)

Following the war’s conclusion, the first written constitution, known as the Articles of Confederation, was drafted in 1776–1777 and ratified by the thirteen colonies in 1781. Although they named the new nation the United States of America and granted Congress the authority to coin money and make alliances, the Articles of Confederation did not enable the federal government to impose taxes or control foreign policy.

These shortcomings led delegates at the Constitutional Convention to write the Constitution in 1787, which granted the federal government powers such as the authority to tax and to regulate interstate commerce. When the Constitution was officially adopted in 1789, it replaced the Articles of Confederation and significantly strengthened the country’s central governmental authority.

战争结束后，第一部成文宪法，即《邦联条例》，于1776-1777年起草，并于1781年得到13个殖民地批准。虽然他们将这个新国家命名为"美利坚合众国"，并授予"国会"铸币和结盟的权力，但《邦联条例》并没有赋予联邦政府"征税"或"控制外交政策"的权力。

这些缺陷促使参加制宪会议的代表们, 在1787年起草了《宪法》，赋予联邦政府"征税"和"监管州际贸易"等权力。1789年, 宪法正式通过，它取代了《邦联条例》，大大加强了国家的中央政府权威。

'''

==  美国建国时的人权保护, 还很不完善, 只保障了”有财产的白人”. 其他各种人群(妇女, 黑人, 原住民等)的权力保护, 要到以后的漫长岁月中, 一点点的争取到.

In theory, the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution reflected the democratic ideals of the Enlightenment, but in practice, the colonists’ achievements were inherently contradictory, since many of the founders were slaveholders. Political liberty coexisted with the institution of slavery, and full constitutional rights and freedoms extended only to White men of property, a minority of the population, and not to women, African Americans, Native Americans, or many immigrants.

从理论上讲，《独立宣言》和美国宪法, 反映了启蒙运动的民主理想，但在实践中，殖民者的成就本质上是矛盾的，因为许多创始人都是奴隶主。"政治自由"与"奴隶制"并存，宪法赋予的全部权利和自由, 在当时只适用于占人口少数的"有财产的白人"，而不适用于妇女、非裔美国人、美洲原住民, 或许多移民。

Although women had participated in the war by leading charitable organizations and refusing to buy goods on which the British imposed taxes, they were excluded from political rights in the new republic.

尽管妇女通过领导慈善组织, 并拒绝购买英国征税的商品, 来参与战争，但她们在新共和国中, 被排除在"政治权利"之外。

The institution of slavery, moreover, gained protection from the Constitution when members of the Constitutional Convention adopted the Three-Fifths Clause, which counted threefifths of the enslaved population in the calculations on which the taxation and political representation of slaveholding states were based. By effectively implying that enslaved people were less than fully human and denying them voting rights, this clause enshrined racial prejudice in the Constitution’s foundations.

Though the Three-Fifths Clause was eventually repealed in 1868, the political disenfranchisement of Black citizens persisted until the civil rights era and beyond.

此外，当制宪会议成员通过“五分之三条款”时，"奴隶制"获得了宪法的保护，该条款在计算蓄奴 州税收, 和政治代表权的基础上, 计算了五分之三的奴隶人口。通过有效地暗示被奴役的人不是"完全的人", 并剥夺他们的投票权，该条款"将种族偏见"铭刻在宪法的基础中。尽管"五分之三条款"最终于 1868 年被废除，但黑人公民的政治权利被剥夺的情况, 一直持续到民权时代及以后。

'''

==  独立战争时, 原住民帮助英国, 来对抗美国人, 导致原住民在战后被排除在谈判之外. 丧失他们对土地的自治权.

The American Revolutionary War was also an unmitigated catastrophe for Native Americans. Based on the fear that a colonial victory would devastate their lands and betray their interests, Native American leaders such as Mohawk chief Thayendanegea had formed alliances with the British and provided them with strategic military support. Revolutionary armies then destroyed Native American towns and crops in western New York and Pennsylvania.

At the war’s conclusion, Native American representatives were excluded from all negotiations, which ultimately resulted in significant loss of their lands and autonomy.

美国独立战争, 对于美洲原住民来说, 也是一场彻头彻尾的灾难。由于担心"殖民地人民的胜利" 会摧毁原住民他们的土地, 并背叛他们的利益，如莫霍克酋长Thayendanegea，与英国人结成联盟，并向他们提供战略军事支持。随后，革命军队摧毁了"纽约州西部"和"宾夕法尼亚州"的美洲原住民的城镇和农作物。战争结束时，美洲原住民代表被排除在所有谈判之外，最终导致他们严重丧失土地和自治权。

'''

==  逐渐将美国版图变成今天的形状

The United States was particularly active in the Pacific. Unlike the other industrial powers, it had not attempted to claim any parts of Africa or Asia beyond some trading concessions in China. Throughout the later nineteenth century, it was developing the land and exploiting the resources within its North American borders. It pushed steadily westward from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, acquiring territory by purchase, treaty, or conquest from France, Britain, and Mexico on the way.

To clear the land for use by farmers, ranchers, miners, and timber companies, by the end of the century the federal government had confined the Indigenous peoples to reservations. In 1867, it purchased the Russian colony of Alaska. By the 1890s, it had settled all its vast territory and began to look abroad.

美国在太平洋地区尤其活跃。与其他工业强国不同的是，除了在中国的一些贸易特许权之外，它并没有试图对非洲或亚洲的任何地区提出主权要求。在整个十九世纪后期，它一直在北美境内开发土地, 并开采资源。它从大西洋稳步向西, 推进到太平洋，途中通过购买、条约或征服, 从法国、英国和墨西哥获得领土。

为了清理土地供农民、牧场主、矿工和木材公司使用，联邦政府在本世纪末将原住民限制在保留 地。 1867年，它购买了俄罗斯殖民地阿拉斯加。到了1890年代，它已经在其广阔的领土上定居下来，并开始放眼海外。

The United States wanted access to the wealth of China as well as land to grow sugarcane, one of the food commodities it could not produce in a quantity to suit its needs.

美国希望获得中国的财富, 以及种植甘蔗的土地，甘蔗是美国无法生产来满足其需求的粮食商品之一。

==  吞并夏威夷 (1898)

The United States’ first significant move to acquire territory for an empire beyond the North American mainland was to take control of Hawaii. Although it had annexed a number of minor islands in the Pacific, including Baker Island, Howland Island, and Midway Atoll, it had done so only with the intent of collecting guano for fertilizer and did not develop or settle them.

In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii.

美国为建立北美大陆以外的帝国, 而采取的第一个重大举措, 是控制夏威夷。尽管它吞并了太平洋上的一些小岛，包括贝克岛、豪兰岛, 和中途岛环礁，但它这样做的目的, 只是为了收集鸟粪作为肥料，而不是开发或定居这些岛屿。

1898年，美国吞并夏威夷。

==  令中国”门户开放” (1900)

In 1900, several of these nations signed a treaty with the Chinese government at the urging of John Hay, the U.S. secretary of state. The treaty established an Open Door policy in which China agreed to trade with all countries on the same terms. In this way, none of the industrialized powers could gain an advantage over the others. In exchange, they promised not to annex any of China’s territory.

1900年，在美国国务卿海伊（John Hay）的敦促下，其中几个国家与中国政府签署了一项条约。该条约确立了"门户开放"政策，中国同意以同等条件与所有国家进行贸易。这样一来，任何一个工业化国家都无法比其他国家获得优势。作为交换，他们承诺不吞并任何中国领土。

==  美国的影响力进入菲律宾 (1898)

In December 1898, Spain recognized Cuba’s independence, ceded Guam and Puerto Rico to the United States, and allowed the United States to purchase the Philippines.

(美西战争后,) 1898年12月，西班牙承认古巴独立，将"关岛"和"波多黎各"割让给美国，并允许美国购买菲律宾。

The Philippines’ proximity to China attracted those who sought to trade with the latter. Many feared Japan or a European power like Germany would seize control of the islands if the United States did not stake its claim to them. Indeed, Germany attempted to establish a base in the Philippines only a few weeks after the Spanish forces surrendered.

菲律宾毗邻中国，吸引了那些寻求与中国进行贸易的人。许多人担心，如果美国不表明对这些岛屿的主权，日本或德国等欧洲大国 就会夺取这些岛屿的控制权。事实上，西班牙军队投降后仅几周，德国就试图在菲律宾建立基地。

This island empire is the last land left in all the oceans. If it should prove a mistake to abandon it, the blunder once made would be irretrievable.

(美国参议员 Albert J. Beveridge 说): 这个岛屿帝国(指菲律宾)是所有海洋中仅存的最后一块陆地。如果事实证明放弃它是一个错误，那么一旦犯了这个错误就无法挽回了。

More and more Europe will manufacture the most it needs, secure from its colonies the most it consumes. Where shall we turn for consumers of our surplus? China is our natural customer. . . . The Philippines give us a base at the door of all the East.

越来越多的欧洲, 将制造它所需要的大部分产品，并从其殖民地获得其消费的大部分产品。我们该去哪里寻找剩余的消费者呢？中国是我们天然的客户...菲律宾给了我们一个位于整个东方门口的基地。

And just beyond the Philippines are China’s illimitable markets. We will not renounce our part in the mission of our race, trustee, under God, of the civilization of the world. And we will move forward to our work, not howling out regrets like slaves whipped to their burdens but with gratitude for a task worthy of our strength and thanksgiving to Almighty God that He has marked us as His chosen people, henceforth to lead in the regeneration of the world.

就在菲律宾以外，是中国无限的市场。我们不会放弃我们在种族使命中的角色——在上帝之下，作为世界文明的托管者。我们将向前迈进，迎接我们的任务，不是像被鞭打到负担前的奴隶那样哀嚎后悔，而是心怀感激，感谢这个与我们力量相称的任务，并感谢全能的上帝，他将我们标记为他所选的人民，从此领导世界的复兴。
