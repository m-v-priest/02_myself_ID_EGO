Water power had earlier replaced animal power, and steam engines fueled by burning coal had driven the machinery of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

水力较早地取代了畜力，以燃煤为燃料的蒸汽机驱动了十八世纪末十九世纪初的机械。到十九世纪末，电力也取代了蒸汽。

==  内燃机 (1860)

The automobile’s arrival depended on another crucial invention—the internal combustion engine. Internal combustion engines powered automobiles as well as machinery in small workshops, offering an alternative where steam engines, which were large, could not easily fit.

汽车的出现取决于另一项重要的发明——内燃机。内燃机为汽车和小型车间的机械, 提供动力，为大型蒸汽机无法轻易安装的地方, 提供替代方案。

1860年，比利时工程师艾蒂安·勒努瓦以蒸汽机为蓝本，制成了首台燃气发动机（以天然气为燃料），同时也是世界上第一台实用的内燃机，获得了专利并批量生产。尽管这台内燃机的效率仅有2%－3%，但其宣告了蒸汽时代即将结束。

== 巴氏灭菌 (1860年代)

Pasteur’s discoveries also led to the pasteurization of milk beginning in the 1860s, making it safer to drink by heating it to destroy pathogens.

巴斯德的发现还导致从 1860 年代开始对牛奶进行"巴氏灭菌"，通过加热消灭病原体，使其饮用更安全。

== 奎宁 (能防止疟疾) (1870年代)

Malaria was also a significant problem in Britain’s colony of India. It was exacerbated by schemes to dig irrigation canals and clear land for railroads, creating more areas for water to collect in breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that carried the disease.

Quinine, which comes from the bark of the cinchona tree, had been used to treat malaria for years, and in the 1840s the British discovered that taking it before exposure could prevent people from ever contracting the disease. Cinchona trees grew only in the Andes, however, and there were not enough to meet the European demand. Attempts to plant cinchona trees elsewhere often failed, but by the 1870s the Dutch were successfully growing them in their colony of Indonesia and producing additional quinine.

疟疾也是英国殖民地印度的一个严重问题。挖掘灌溉渠, 和清理土地修建铁路的计划, 加剧了这种情况, 为携带这种疾病的蚊子的繁殖地, 创造了更多的积水区域。

"奎宁"来自"金鸡纳树"的树皮，多年来一直被用来治疗"疟疾". 1840 年代英国人发现, 在接触疟疾之前服用"奎宁", 可以防止人们感染这种疾病。然而，"金鸡纳树"只生长在安第斯山脉，不足以满足欧洲的需求。在其他地方种植"金鸡纳树"的尝试常常失败，但到了 1870 年代，荷兰人在印度尼西亚殖民地成功种植了"金鸡纳树"，因此能生产更多的"奎宁".

== 电灯 (1879)

Electricity ran machines in factories and lit streets, workplaces, and homes following the invention of the incandescent light bulb, by Joseph Swan in Britain in 1878 and Thomas Edison in the United States in 1879.

继 1878 年英国的约瑟夫·斯旺 (Joseph Swan), 和  1879 年美国的托马斯·爱迪生 (Thomas Edison)发明白炽灯泡后，电力为工厂的机器提供了动力，为街道、工作场所和家庭提供了照明。
