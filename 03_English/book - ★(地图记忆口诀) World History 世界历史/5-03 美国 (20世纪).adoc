== 美国在第一次世界大战前, 一直维持”孤立主义”

Isolationism had been a consistent practice of U.S. foreign policy, and the United States planned to maintain it, while at the same time selling products to both the Allied powers of Britain and France and the Central powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. It was clear from the outset, however, that “the vast majority of American trade went to the Allies,” partly because of Britain’s substantial role in U.S. naval, merchant, and credit operations but also because the British blockade made it difficult for anyone to trade with Germany.

U.S. banks were soon extending loans and lines of credit to both sides as well, although approximately $2 billion had been extended to the Allies by the spring of 1917 and a mere $27 million to the Central powers.

孤立主义一直是美国外交政策的一贯做法，美国计划维持这一做法，同时向英法联盟, 以及德国和奥匈帝国等联盟国出售产品。然而，从一开始就很明显，“美国的绝大多数贸易, 都流向了英法联盟”，部分原因是, 英国在美国海军、商业和信贷业务中发挥着重要作用，但也因为英国的封锁使任何人都很难与德国进行贸易。

美国银行, 很快也向双方提供贷款和信贷额度，尽管到 1917 年春天已向英法俄提供了约 20 亿 美元，而向德奥提供的贷款和信贷额度, 仅为 2,700 万美元。

Among the American public, there was little support for or interest in entering this European war. Not hampered by censorship of the news as the combatant powers were, American readers could easily learn about the casualty numbers and the horror of the war.

在美国公众中，几乎没有人支持或有兴趣参与这场欧洲战争。美国读者不像交战国那样受到"新闻审查"的阻碍，可以轻松了解战争的伤亡数字和恐怖。

However, his commitment to the freedom of the seas and the rights of neutral nations in times of war soon put him on a collision course with Germany.

In 1917, germany announced in January of that year that it would engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. This meant that any ship in a war zone was a target for sinking even if it were sailing under the flag of a neutral power, so U.S. merchant ships were now subject to being torpedoed.

==  美国决定参战(一战) 的原因

=== ① 德国的无限制潜艇战, 威胁了航海自由.

然而，他(美国伍德罗·威尔逊总统)对保持住战争时期"海洋自由"和"中立国家权利"的承诺, 很快使他与德国发生了冲突。

1917 年，德国于当 年一月宣布, 将进行无限制潜艇战。这意味着, 战区的任何船只, 即使是悬挂中立国旗帜的, 都将成为可能被攻击的目标，因此美国商船现在很容易遭到鱼雷袭击。

Germany made this decision because it felt that Britain would be forced to pull out of the war if the lifeline of cargo coming to it from the United States were cut off. Germany had suffered food shortages beginning in 1915. By 1917, as a result of the British blockade and the enlistment of male farm laborers for war, the nation’s urban population was starving, and its troops were on reduced rations. Unless Britain withdrew from the war soon, Germany would be forced to surrender.

Obviously, Germany knew this decision would anger the United States and could well cause it to enter the war itself, but it was a gamble its leaders were prepared to take. They fully believed that Germany could achieve victory if it could force the British to surrender before the United States could enter the war.

德国做出这一决定是因为它认为，如果从美国运往德国的货物生命线被切断，英国将被迫退出战争。 德国从 1915 年开始就遭遇粮食短缺。到 1917 年，由于英国的封锁, 和征召男性农场工人参加战争，德国的城市人口陷入饥饿，军队的口粮也减少。除非英国尽快退出战争，否则德国将被迫投降。

显然， 德国知道, “无限制潜艇战”这一决定会激怒美国，并很可能导致美国参战，但这是德国领导人进行的一场赌博。他们坚信，如果德国能够在美国参战之前迫使英国投降，德国就能取得胜利。(就跟二战时日本的想法一样, 先优先打下南洋, 就能与美国开战.)

'''

===  ② 德国与墨西哥做交易, 想要用美国领土做回报, 割让给墨西哥

Further exacerbating tensions between Germany and the United States was the publication on March 1, 1917, of the Zimmermann Telegram. This message had been sent to Mexico by Germany’s foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, offering a deal. Germany wanted the Mexican government, in the event of war with the United States, to actively cause more disturbances along the border, keeping even more U.S. troops there and thus unavailable for deployment to Europe.

In return for Mexico’s cooperation, upon its victory, Germany would grant it the region of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, territory it had lost in 1848 as a result of war with the United States.

1917 年 3 月 1 日的"齐默尔曼电报", 德哥外长对墨西哥提出一项交易: 只要德美战争时, 墨西哥在墨美边境制造混乱, 牵制住美军, 让其无法派往欧洲. 德国就在获胜后, 将墨西哥在 1848年美墨战争中, 丧失给美国的领土重新交给墨西哥. 包括: 得克萨斯州、新墨西哥州, 和亚利桑那州地区.

'''

===  ③ 如果德国占领欧洲, 美国银行贷款给欧洲国家的钱, 就收不回来了.

U.S. banks, which realized the loans they had extended to the European Allies would go unpaid if Germany won, already supported their country’s involvement, as did businesses that hoped U.S. assistance would encourage the Allies to grant them greater access to global markets.

美国援助欧洲, 有两个好处: ①美国银行能贷款给欧洲国家, 如果德国占领欧洲, 这些钱美国就收不回来了, ②美国企业的产品能进入欧洲市场 (军源物资, 民生产品等)

Even the victorious nations faced economic problems. Britain and France had borrowed billions to finance the war and had sizable debts to repay, many to the United States.

(一战后,) 即使是战胜国也面临着经济问题。英国和法国借了数十亿美元来资助战争，并有大量债务需要偿还，其中许多债务从美国借入的。


In April 1917, the United States entered the conflict on the side of the Allied powers.

因此, 美国于1917 年 4 月 参战.

'''

==  美国通过 <间谍法>(1917) 和 <煽动叛乱法>(1918)

The U.S. government’s effort to squash criticism of the war began in 1917 with the Espionage Act. It set limits on what could be mailed, banning any type of anti-war newspaper or pamphlet.

美国政府于 1917 年通过《间谍法》, 开始努力压制对战争的批评。它对邮寄物品进行了限制，禁止任何类型的反战报纸或小册子。

In 1918, Congress passed the Sedition Act. This forbade “disloyal, profane, scurrilous, and abusive” language about the decision to enter the war, the draft, the flag, and armed forces’ uniforms. It was not about what might be true, but about what could be seen as disloyal. Anti-war speech was considered disloyal and therefore seditious. People were unable to openly question why the United States was in the war or speak out against it without risking imprisonment or hefty fines.

Today we see the Sedition Act as a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which promises protections for free speech. Despite this, the Supreme Court upheld the act.

1918年，国会通过了《煽动叛乱法》 。该法案禁止在参战决定、征兵、国旗和武装部队制服方面, 使用“不忠诚、亵渎、粗俗和辱骂”的语言。这不是关于什么可能是"真实"的，而是关于什么可能被视为"不忠诚"。反战言论被认为是不忠诚的，因此具有煽动性。人们无法公开质疑"美国为何卷入战争"，也无法"公开反对战争"，否则就会面临监禁, 或巨额罚款的风险。

今天，我们认为《煽动叛乱法》违反了"美国宪法第一修正案"，该修正案承诺"保护言论自由"。尽管如此，(当时的) 最高法院还是维持了该法案.

Poets published work that put the inhumanity and suffering of the war on full display. No heroic charges were celebrated in their stanzas.

诗人的作品充分展现了战争的不人道和苦难。他们的诗节中没有庆祝英雄的冲锋。

'''

== 一战后, 美国经济的繁荣

The United States did not suffer the physical devastation of war that the other Allies did. It emerged from the conflict in a position of economic power, a creditor nation to be repaid for its wartime loans to Britain and France. Thus, the 1920s were a decade of prosperity for the country.

美国没有像其他盟国那样遭受战争的物质破坏。它从一战中崛起，成为经济大国. 20年代是美国繁荣的十年。

'''

==  为了解决大萧条问题, 罗斯福施行新政

In the United States, new president Franklin D. Roosevelt unveiled a comprehensive reform plan in 1933. This New Deal was designed to restore faith in the banking system, create work-relief programs to put the unemployed to work, increase the bargaining and consumer power of industrial workers, and provide an overall enhanced quality of life.

在美国，新任总统富兰克林·罗斯福于 1933 年公布了一项全面的改革计划。这项新政旨在恢复人们对银行体系的信心，创建工作救济计划，让失业者找到工作，提高产业工人的议价能力和消费能力，并提供全面提高的生活质量。

'''

===  保障储户在银行中的存款安全 → 联邦存款保险公司 (FDIC)

Overhauls to the banking system included more regulations on U.S. banks and regular audit controls. The creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 meant that depositors could feel their money on deposit was safe.

银行体系的改革包括, 对美国银行的更多监管, 和定期审计控制。 1933 年联"邦存款保险公司" (FDIC)的成立, 意味着储户可以感觉到他们的存款是安全的。

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was created in 1933 to insure depositor monies in banks. Originally it covered $5,000 per depositor, but it now covers $250,000 per depositor.

"联邦存款保险公司" (FDIC) 成立于 1933 年，旨在为银行存款提供保险。最初它为每位储户提供 5,000 美元的保障，但现在为每位储户提供 250,000 美元的保障。

'''

===  建立”社保养老”工程

The United States also adopted programs that already existed elsewhere. For example, the Social Security Administration was created in 1935 to provide an old-age pension program for the country. Germany had such a program for several decades, and Britain had already enacted many programs as part of its welfare state that the United States was slow to adopt.

美国还采用了在其他国家已经存在的计划。例如，"社会保障管理局"成立于 1935 年，旨在为国家提供养老金计划。德国实行这样的计划已经有几十年了，英国也已经制定了许多计划作为其福利国家的一部分，而美国却迟迟没有采用。

The Social Security program was begun in 1935 to oversee Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), unemployment insurance, and aid to families.

社会保障计划, 始于 1935 年，旨在监督”老年和遗属保险” (OASI)、失业保险, 和家庭援助。

'''

=== 最低工资

The federal minimum wage was established in 1938 as an increase over the minimum wages in many industries, though some workers, such as domestic workers, were left out.

联邦最低工资于 1938 年制定，提高了许多行业的最低工资，但一些工人（例如家政工人）被排除在外。


'''

==  二战前, 美国执行<中立法案>, 禁止向交战国出口武器, 和提供贷款

In the 1930s, the United States wanted to insulate itself from conflicts in the rest of the world. Aroused by dramatic hearings into the causes of the country’s entry into World War I, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts in 1935, 1936, and 1937, forbidding the export of arms and the making of loans to belligerent nations. These acts effectively handcuffed the government.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in 1933 just two months after Hitler became chancellor of Germany, was prevented from rendering much assistance to China against Japan, to Ethiopia against Italy, or to Republican Spain against fascist General Franco. But the 1937 Neutrality Act granted Roosevelt a little leeway. The United States could render nonmilitary assistance such as oil to a belligerent nation if that nation could both pay cash for the goods and carry them home itself.

20 世纪 30 年代，美国希望自己免受世界其他地区冲突的影响。由于对美国参加第一次世界大战的原因进行了激烈的听证会，国会于1935年、1936年和1937年通过了《中立法案》，禁止向交战国出口武器和提供贷款。这些行为有效地束缚了政府。

1933年，就在希特勒就任德国总理两个月后, 富兰克林·罗斯福就任美国总统. 他无法向中国提供大量援助以对抗日本，无法资助埃塞俄比亚来对抗意大利, 或资助共和派西班牙以对抗法西斯佛朗哥将军, 提供太多援助。但1937年的《中立法案》, 给了罗斯福一点回旋余地。美国可以向交战国提供非军事援助，如石油，前提是这个国家既可以用现金购买货物，并自行把货物运回国。

'''

==  为防备二战, 而扩充军备

To beef up the defenses of the United States, Roosevelt pressed Congress to approve a two-ocean navy in 1938 and began to funnel aid to Britain and China within the confines of what was allowable.

为了加强美国的防御，罗斯福于 1938 年敦促国会批准, 建立横跨两洋的海军，并开始在允许的范围内, 向英国和中国提供援助。

'''

==  国会废除<中立法案>, 允许他国以”现购自运”的方式, 购买美国军事装备. (1939.11)

As the world watched Hitler annex Czechoslovakia and then invade Poland, Roosevelt sought to offer more substantial military assistance to Britain and France.
After much debate, in November 1939 Congress repealed provisions of earlier Neutrality Acts and authorized trade in military hardware on a cash-and-carry basis.

当全世界目睹希特勒吞并捷克斯洛伐克，然后入侵波兰时，罗斯福寻求向英国和法国提供更多实质性军事援助。 经过多次辩论，国会于 1939 年 11 月废除了早期"中立法案"的条款， 并授权以"现金购买,自行运回"的方式进行军事装备贸易。

'''

==  租借法案 (1941.3)

In one ten-day period in July 1940, German submarines sank eleven British destroyers, prompting the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, to appeal to the United States for help. Liberally interpreting the Neutrality Act of 1939, Roosevelt agreed to exchange fifty World War I–era destroyers for lease rights at British naval bases in Newfoundland and the Caribbean.

In March 1941, the president persuaded Congress to approve the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the government to “sell, transfer title to, exchange, lease, lend or otherwise dispose of, to any such government any defense article.” The United States could now provide these materials to any country deemed vital to its own defense. It was a way to aid those countries already fighting but without taking direct military action.

1940年7月，在短短十天内，德国潜艇击沉了11艘英国驱逐舰，这促使英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔向美国求助。罗斯福总统灵活解读了1939年的《中立法案》，同意以50艘一战时期的驱逐舰, 换取在"纽芬兰"和"加勒比地区"的英国海军基地的租借权。

1941年3月，罗斯福总统成功说服国会通过了《租借法案》，该法案允许政府“向任何此类政府出售、转让所有权、交换、租借、借贷或以其他方式处置任何防御物资。”美国现在可以向任何被认为对自身防卫至关重要的国家提供这些物资。这是一种"援助那些正在作战的国家，但并不美国自己直接采取军事行动"的方法。

The Lend-Lease program sent material and foodstuffs to forty Allied nations, mainly Britain and the Soviet Union. Government efforts to spur production led to nearly full employment in many nations. In the United States, unemployment dropped from 15 percent in 1939 to 1 percent in 1943 as seventeen million new civilian jobs were created.

租借法案向四十个盟国运送了物资和食品， 其中主要是英国和苏联.
政府刺激生产的努力, 导致许多国家几乎充分就业。在美国，失业率从 1939 年的 15%,  下降到 1943 年 的 1%，创造了 1700 万个新的平民就业岗位。

== 曼哈顿计划 (1942.8) → 研究原子弹 (1945.7月成功)

In December 1938, German physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann accidentally split atoms and discovered nuclear fission.

1938年12月，德国物理学家奥托·哈恩, 和弗里茨·斯特拉斯曼, 意外分裂了原子, 并发现了"核裂变".

By the late 1930s, British and other scientists became convinced that an atomic bomb was possible, and teams of physicists, some of them refugees from Nazi Germany, assembled and began experiments with nuclear chain reactions, the catalysts of an atomic explosion.

In August 1942, the U.S. government boosted this effort with its top-secret Manhattan Project. At dozens of sites across the United States, from Los Alamos in New Mexico to Oak Ridge in Tennessee and Hanford in Washington State, 600,000 workers embarked on a frenetic race to build the world’s first atomic bomb.

到了 20 世纪 30 年代末，英国和其他国家的科学家开始相信, "原子弹"是可能实现的，物理学家组成的团队（其中一些是纳粹德国的难民）聚集起, 来并开始了"核链式反应"（原子爆炸的催化剂）的实验。

1942 年 8 月，美国政府通过绝密的"曼哈顿计划"加强了这一努力。从新墨西哥州的洛斯阿拉莫斯, 到田纳西州的橡树岭, 和华盛顿州的汉福德，在美国各地的数十个地点，600,000 名工人开始了制造世界上第一颗原子弹的疯狂竞赛。

Meanwhile, Germany and Japan were also attempting to build their own.

The German effort was hindered by technical and other problems. For example, top German scientists had fled Germany, and some were assisting the Manhattan Project. Further, Hitler preferred to support the development of V2 bombers for the air war with England rather than an atomic bomb.

In 1941, the Japanese commissioned physicist Yoshio Nishina to begin working on an atomic bomb, calling the project Ni-Go. But lacking any information shared by the Germans and suffering under successful U.S. air raids, the project did not make much progress.

与此同时，德国和日本也试图建立自己的原子弹。

德国的努力受到技术和其他问题的阻碍。例如，德国顶尖科学家纷纷逃离德国，其中一些正在协助"曼哈顿计划"。此外，希特勒更愿意支持开发用于与英国空战的 V2导弹，而不是原子弹。

1941 年，日本委托物理学家仁科芳雄开始研究原子弹，将该项目称为 Ni-Go。但由于缺乏德国人分享的任何信息，并且受到美国成功空袭的影响，该项目并没有取得太大进展。

Eventually, in July 1945, the Manhattan Project bore fruit, and a bomb was successfully detonated in the Trinity Test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. William L. Laurence, the official historian of the project, described this first successful trial of an atomic weapon: “On that moment hung eternity. Time stood still. Space contracted to a pinpoint. It was as though the earth had opened and the skies split. One felt as though they had been privileged to witness the Birth of the World—to be present at the moment of Creation when the Lord Said: Let there be light.”

President Roosevelt had died suddenly in April 1945, succeeded by Vice President Harry S. Truman. It fell to Truman to decide whether to use the new weapon or not.

最终，1945年7月，"曼哈顿计划"取得了成果，一枚炸弹在新墨西哥州"阿拉莫戈多"的三位一体测试中成功引爆。该项目的官方历史学家威廉·L·劳伦斯 (William L. Laurence) 描述了原子武器的首次成功试验： “那一刻是永恒的。时间静止了。空间收缩到了一个点。仿佛大地裂开，天空裂开。人们感觉自己好像有幸见证了世界的诞生——在创世的那一刻，当主说：要有光时，他们就在场。”

1945 年 4 月，罗斯福总统突然去世，副总统哈里·S·杜鲁门继任。是否使用这种新武器由杜鲁门决定。

Truman had known little about the Manhattan Project before becoming president and now relied on the advice of his experts.

杜鲁门在成为总统之前对曼哈顿计划知之甚少，现在依赖于专家的建议。

'''

=== 科学家"对核武器对人类意味着什么"的观点

When it became clear that the Manhattan Project had been successful, a panel of scientists led by Robert Oppenheimer, the project’s head, made recommendations about the weapon they had created in a report dated June 16, 1945.

当曼哈顿计划明显取得成功后，由该项目负责人"罗伯特·奥本海默"(Robert Oppenheimer) 领导的一个科学家小组, 在 1945 年 6 月 16 日的一份报告中, 对他们制造的武器提出了建议。

The opinions of our scientific colleagues on the initial use of these weapons are not unanimous. We can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war.

我们的科学同事, 对于这些武器的最初使用意见, 并不一致。我们不能提出任何可能结束战争的技术演示.

The war has to be brought speedily to a successful conclusion and attacks by atomic bombs may very well be an effective method of warfare. We feel, however, that such attacks on Japan could not be justified, at least not unless the terms which will be imposed after the war on Japan were made public in detail and Japan were given an opportunity to surrender.

If Japan still refused to surrender our nation might then, in certain circumstances, find itself forced to resort to the use of atomic bombs. Such a step, however, ought not to be made at any time without seriously considering the moral responsibilities which are involved.

战争必须尽快取得胜利，原子弹攻击很可能是一种有效的战争方法。然而，我们认为， 对日本的这种攻击是不合理的，至少除非详细公布"对日战争后强加的条款"，并给予日本"投降的机会"。

如果日本仍然拒绝投降，那么，在某些情况下，我们的国家可能会被迫使用原子弹。但是，在没有认真考虑所涉及的道德责任之前，在任何时候都不应该采取这样的步骤。

The atomic bombs at our disposal represent only the first step in this direction, and there is almost no limit to the destructive power which will become available in the course of their future development. Thus a nation which sets the precedent of using these newly liberated forces of nature for purposes of destruction may have to bear the responsibility of opening the door to an era of devastation on an unimaginable scale.

If after this war a situation is allowed to develop in the world which permits rival powers to be in uncontrolled possession of these new means of destruction, the cities of the United States as well as the cities of other nations will be in continuous danger of sudden annihilation.

我们所拥有的原子弹, 只是朝这个方向迈出的第一步，在其未来的发展过程中，其破坏力几乎是无限的。因此，一个开创了"利用这些新解放的自然力量, 来进行破坏"的先例的国家, 可能必须承担为"一个规模难以想象的破坏时代"打开大门的责任。(犹如AI)

如果在这场战争之后，世界上出现一种情况，允许敌对国家, 不受控制地拥有这些新的破坏手段，那么美国的城市, 以及其他国家的城市, 将持续面临突然毁灭的危险。

The added material strength which this lead gives to the United States brings with it the obligation of restraint and if we were to violate this obligation our moral position would be weakened in the eyes of the world and in our own eyes. It would then be more difficult for us to live up to our responsibility of bringing the unloosened forces of destruction under control.

这种领先地位, 给美国带来了额外的物质力量，同时也带来了克制的义务，如果我们违反这一义务，我们的道德地位, 在世界和我们自己的眼中, 就会被削弱。那么我们就更难履行我们的责任，控制未释放的破坏力量。

If you had been President Truman, would you have ordered the bomb to be dropped? Why or why not?

如果你是杜鲁门总统，你会下令投下炸弹吗？为什么或为什么不呢？ (不迷信盲从领导人的选择. 每个领导人都有自己的选择, 正如每界美国总统, 都会在选举时提出自己的政策, 而不是照搬前人的政策, 因为前人的政策已被证明解决不了目前的国家问题. 不然你也不会被选举成新的国家领导人.)
