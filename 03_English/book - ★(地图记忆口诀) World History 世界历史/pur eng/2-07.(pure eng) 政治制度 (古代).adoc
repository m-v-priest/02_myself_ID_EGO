|议员的来源

|Athens had developed a functioning direct democracy, which differs from modern republics in which citizens vote for representatives who sit in the legislature. All citizens could sit in the Athenian Assembly, which then was required to meet at least ten times a year.


Athens had a citizen body of thirty to forty thousand adult males in the Classical period, but only six thousand needed to convene for meetings of the Assembly. Citizens could also be chosen by lot to sit in the Council.

Since they were permitted to serve for just two one-year terms over a lifetime, many Athenians had the opportunity to participate in the executive branch of government.





|议会的权力

|- All laws had to be approved by the Assembly. +


- Only the Assembly could declare war and approve treaties. +

=== (司法)陪审团

All Athenians could appeal the ruling of a magistrate in court and have their cases heard by a jury of fellow citizens.


All citizens also served on juries, which not only determined the guilt or innocence of the accused but also interpreted the way the law was applied.


Women, enslaved people, and foreign residents could not participate.



'''

=== 财富决定从政职位

Solon set up a hierarchal system in which citizens were eligible for positions in government based on wealth instead of hereditary privilege. Wealth was measured by the amount of grain and olive oil a citizen’s land could produce.

== (古罗马) 政治制度

=== 平民从贵族那里获取政治权力的过程.

Roman society was divided into two classes or orders, patricians and plebeians.

|-> 早期的情况: 国家由"法官"和"元老院"来统治. 并且能进入元老院的, 只有贵族.

|In the early republic, Rome was ruled by elected magistrates instead of kings, and by a Council of Elders or Senate.

The patricians were the aristocratic elite, who alone could hold public office and sit in the Senate.



From the beginning of the republic through the third century BCE, the plebeians, or common people, worked to achieve equality before the law in Roman society. When Rome was under threat, the plebeians could gain leverage with the patricians by refusing to fight until their demands were met.


|-> 用文字, 将罗马法律(十二铜表法) 书写下来, 供平民查阅检查, 以免空口无凭

|In 450 BCE, the plebeians went on strike for the first time. They feared that patrician judges were interpreting Rome’s unwritten laws to take advantage of ignorant plebeians, so they demanded the laws be written down. The patricians agreed. In the Twelve Tables, published in the Forum, Rome’s laws were written for the first time and were then accessible to all citizens.


|-> 平民大会, 选出”保民官”, 出席国家议会, 法院, 代表平民阶层来发声, 阻止贵族们做出对平民不利的决策.

|After 450 BCE, the plebeians met in a Plebeian Assembly that annually elected ten officials known as tribunes. These tribunes attended meetings of Rome’s assemblies, the Senate, and the law courts. If they saw any public body or official taking action that would bring harm to plebeians, they could say “Veto” or “I forbid” and stop that action. This power to veto gave plebeians a way to protect themselves and put a check on the power of patrician officials.


|-> 共和国的两名最高官员(执政官), 其中一人的职位, 必须由平民来担任

|In the fourth and third centuries BCE, plebeians won more concessions by again seceding from the patrician state. After 367 BCE, one of the two consuls, the highest officials in the republic, had to be a plebeian.




|-> 平民议会, 有立法权

|After 287 BCE, the Plebeian Assembly could pass laws for the republic that were introduced to it by the tribunes, and their laws applied to all Roman citizens.



|===


By the third century BCE, this system was being administrated by a combination of public assemblies, elected officials, and the Senate.


By the third century BCE, the Struggle of the Orders had effectively concluded, since it was now possible for plebeians to pass laws, serve as elected officials, and sit in the Senate, equals of the patricians under Roman law. The Struggle of the Orders did not bring equality to everyone in Rome, however. Rather, it gave well-off plebeians access to positions of power.


'''

=== 三大公共会议(议会) : ①the Plebeian Assembly 平民大会、② the Tribal Assembly 部族会议, ③ the Centuriate Assembly 百人议会

The Roman Republic had three main public assemblies—the Plebeian Assembly, the Tribal Assembly, and the Centuriate Assembly—that elected various officials every year.


'''

==== -> the Plebeian Assembly 平民大会

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]

|拥有的权力: ①法律提议权, ②否决权

|It was this assembly that annually elected the ten tribunes, who possessed veto power and could present laws to the assembly for approval.


|成员来源: 只能平民

|Only plebeians could attend *the Plebeian Assembly*, organized into thirty-five regional tribes with a single vote each.

==== -> the Tribal Assembly 部族大会

[.small]

|拥有的权力: 能选出负责公共资金的”财务官”

|Every year, the Tribal Assembly elected the Quaestors, treasurers in charge of public money.


|成员来源: 平民,贵族

|The Tribal Assembly was likewise divided into thirty-five tribes based on place of residence, with each tribe casting one vote, but both plebeians and patricians could attend.

|===

'''

==== -> the Centuriate Assembly 百人大会

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]

|拥有的权力: ①宣战, ②选出军事指挥官, 法官, 检察官.

|- Only the Centuriate Assembly could declare war, though the Senate remained in control of foreign policy.


- This assembly also elected military commanders, judges, and the censor, whose main task was to conduct the census to assess the wealth of Rome’s citizens.



|成员来源: 平民, 贵族

|Both plebeians and patricians could attend this assembly, which was organized into blocs. The number of votes assigned to each bloc was based on the number of centuries — meaning a group of one hundred men in a military unit—that bloc could afford to equip with weapons and armor. Wealthier citizens had more votes because they could pay more to support the military.

==== 元老院 the Roman Senate

[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|拥有权力: ①决定公共资金(国家财政)的使用方式, ②对执政的官员提出建议

|By far the most powerful institution in the Roman state, the Senate decided how public money was to be spent and advised elected officials on their course of action.  +
Elected officials rarely ignored the Senate’s advice since many of them would be senators themselves after leaving office.


In the late 400s and early 500s, the centralization of imperial power was coupled with intense growth of the empire’s bureaucratic system. The Roman senatorial class in particular had changed. While in earlier centuries the Senate had played an important administrative role for the entire state, it now acted largely as a type of aristocratic “city council” for the city of Rome itself, making few meaningful decisions beyond city management and with many members choosing not even to attend.


|成员来源: 从官员中来

|All elected officials joined the Roman Senate as members for life after their term in office.

'''

=== civitas 公民权:  罗马公民身份, 享有的权力

Citizenship conferred voting rights, the right to perform military service, the right to run for public office, and certain marriage and property rights, among others.


Romans carried on a perpetual debate about citizenship, or civitas, and whether to extend its benefits to different groups.
The extent to which non-Romans were barred from enjoying these rights was not always clear.


'''

===  "赞助人-接受者"制度 The patron-client system

The patron-client system was another important element in the Roman political system. A patron was usually a wealthy citizen who provided legal and financial assistance to his clients, who were normally less affluent citizens. In return, clients in the Roman assemblies voted as directed by their patrons. Patrons could inherit clients, and those with many wielded great influence in Rome.


The traditional patron-client system collapsed, as landless Romans no longer needed the assistance of patrons to settle property disputes. Politicians therefore had to win the support of the urban masses with free food, entertainment such as gladiatorial combats, and promises to create jobs through public works projects.


These epic games (and the distribution of free wheat) were meant to distract the people from potential weaknesses in Roman governance. The idea was that those whose immediate needs were being met with food and entertainment were less likely to notice social inequality, become discontented, or foment rebellion.


'''

===  行省

The Roman Empire was divided into administrative units called provinces. A province was governed by a magistrate chosen by the Senate or personally by the emperor. The term for governing a senatorial province was one year, while that for administering an imperial province was indefinite.

Provincial governors had imperium, or jurisdiction over a territory or military legion. They were also relatively autonomous in managing their territory.

===  (古罗马) 罗马共和国, 转变成罗马帝国

After 146 BCE, no power remained in the Mediterranean that could challenge Rome.


The Expansion of Rome. This map shows Rome’s expansion in the second century BCE as it responded to perceived threats to its power from neighboring kingdoms.


image:/img/0010.jpg[,100%]

Rome’s constant wars and conquests in the third and second centuries BCE created a host of social, economic, and political problems for the republic.


The Roman people grew dissatisfied with the leadership of the Senate and the aristocratic elite, and they increasingly looked to strong military leaders to address the problems.

These problems also presaged the political transformations Rome was to suffer through in the following decades. Between 60 BCE and 31 BCE, a string of powerful military leaders took the stage and bent the Republic to their will. In their struggle for power, Rome descended further into civil war and disorder. By 27 BCE, only one leader remained. Under his powerful hand, the Republic became a mere façade for the emergent Roman Empire.

==  (日耳曼人) 政体

Across all Germanic societies, warfare was an important tool for building social prestige. There were no formal hierarchies, so advancement was possible for any willing to serve a powerful chieftain or king. In return, leaders promised loot and the chance to do great deeds. A king who could not ensure material or social resources would lose followers and could not expect to be obeyed.
