==  欧洲的区域经济合作组织

As a result, not only was it able to provide funds to war-torn nations to rebuild their economies and their infrastructure as part of the Marshall Plan, but U.S.-manufactured goods also flooded into markets around the world.


Among the forces driving European economic integration was a desire for Europe to be more independent of the United States.


'''

===   英国加入”欧洲经济共同体” (1973)

Although Britain supported the EEC’s economic goals, it was initially not interested in the political cooperation the group represented.

When it did signal its desire to join, Britain wanted special protections for its agriculture and other exceptions for its Commonwealth connections, such as Canada. This meant negotiating with France, then the EEC’s most powerful member. Since decisions at that time were made unanimously and member countries had the power to unilaterally veto, France’s approval was crucial. President Charles de Gaulle of France did not approve, however.

Over the next several years, Britain officially applied for EEC membership twice. Both times de Gaulle worried that admitting Britain, with its strong ties to the United States, would transform the organization into an Atlantic community controlled by Washington. Britain was admitted in 1973 (along with Denmark and Ireland), when de Gaulle was no longer president of France. It took a UK referendum in 1975 to confirm the country’s EEC membership.





'''

=== 欧盟建立 (1993)

By 1993, the EEC had been integrated into the newly created European Union (EU). The EU was conceived as a single market for the free movement of goods, services, money, and people. Citizens of member countries can freely move to other EU countries and legally work there, just as they can in their own country.

In 1999, the EU introduced its own currency, the euro. The euro was not universally adopted by member states, though. The United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, and a few others kept their own currencies.



'''

=== 英国脱离欧盟 (2016)

In 2016, however, 52 percent of the citizens of the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU.

Many also disliked the fact that its membership in the EU made it easier for people from elsewhere in Europe, including recent immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, to enter Britain.

Some also argued that losing the trade advantages that came with belonging to the EU could result in shortages in stores and more expensive products.




In Europe, the European Parliament, the EU’s legislative body, was angry that Brexit might threaten the entire EU project. To show its displeasure and possibly to deter any other member states from leaving, the European Parliament wanted the separation to be as painful for the United Kingdom as possible, and many member countries supported this hardline stance.

In today’s post-Brexit world, there are new regulations on British goods entering the EU and no automatic recognition of British professional licenses in the EU. Britons seeking to make long-term stays in EU countries now must apply for visas.

== 北美的区域经济合作组织

It also encouraged some national leaders to seek regional international economic integration along lines similar to Western Europe’s achievement.


'''

==  美国-加拿大 自由贸易协定 (1988)

Beginning in the 1980s, the United States and Canada entered into negotiations to create their own regional free-trading zone. In 1988, the two countries agreed to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (Canada-US FTA), which eliminated barriers to the movement of goods and services between the two.


'''

===  NAFTA 北美自由贸易协定 (1992) → 美国, 加拿大, 墨西哥

Almost immediately, Mexico signaled its interest in creating a similar free trade agreement with the United States. Ultimately, Canada joined the plan with Mexico as well, and by the end of 1992, all three countries had signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

The intent of NAFTA was to reduce trade barriers and allow goods to flow freely among the three countries. Despite considerable resistance within the United States, largely from industrial workers who feared their factories and jobs would be relocated to Mexico where wages were far lower, the agreement was ratified by all three countries and went into effect in 1994.



The creation of Canada-US FTA and later NAFTA represented an important policy shift for the United States.


'''

===  USMCA 美墨加三国协议 (2020)

The impression that NAFTA and globalization have brought poverty and misery to the working class in the United States remains strong and has influenced the nation’s politics since the 1990s.

Responding to these beliefs, in 2017, President Donald Trump instigated a renegotiation of NAFTA, creating the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The USMCA included strong property rights protections, compelled Canada to open its dairy market more broadly, and required that workers in the automotive sector in all three countries be paid competitive wages. The agreement replaced NAFTA and went into effect in 2020.



'''

===  南美的区域经济合作组织

As the creation of the EU and NAFTA demonstrate, the signing of international trade agreements like GATT, which was ratified by countries on six continents, did not prevent regions from establishing their own free trade blocs like MERCOSUR, the South American trading bloc created in 1991.


'''

==  亚太的区域经济合作组织

Nor have such blocs been confined to the West. The most notable to emerge in Asia are the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).


'''

===  ASEAN  东盟 (1967. 8)

ASEAN had its beginnings in the 1960s when Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand agreed to cooperate economically to foster regional development and resist the expansion of communism in Asia. By the early 2000s, it was openly advocating the creation of EU-style integration in the area.


'''

===   APEC 亚太经合组织 (1989)

APEC, launched in 1989, was in many ways a response to the growth of regional trading blocs like ASEAN and the EEC. It promotes free trade and international economic cooperation among its members.



'''

==   世界性的经济合作组织

Until the early 1980s, the country had largely avoided limited regional trading deals, preferring instead to seek comprehensive global agreements.


'''

===  世界贸易组织 (1995) → 其前身是 “GATT 关税及贸易总协定” (1947)

Such efforts had begun relatively soon after World War II in the form of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed in 1947 by twenty-three countries. Initially conceived as a way to reinforce other postwar economic recovery efforts, GATT was designed to prevent the reemergence of prewar-style trade barriers, to lower trade barriers overall, and to create a system for arbitrating international trade disputes.


The most favoured nation (MFN) principle is based on the idea that countries should treat all their trade partners equally—that no one country should be “more favoured.” It means no country should give special treatment to goods or services coming from one particular trading partner.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has made the most favoured nation principle part of its rules. WTO members are not allowed to favour any one country with, for example, lower tariffs on particular products without giving all members the same benefit.

Countries should also not give preferred treatment to their own products and services—which would be known as national treatment.






In 1995, at the Uruguay Round, GATT transformed itself into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and cleared the path for free trade among 123 countries.

Like GATT, the intent of the WTO was to support international trade, reduce trade barriers, and resolve trade disputes between countries.

Unlike GATT, however, the WTO is not a free trade agreement. Rather, it is an organization that ensures nondiscriminatory trade between WTO countries. This means that trade barriers are allowed, but they must apply equally to all members.



Many observers saw the creation of the WTO as a triumph of globalization, or the emergence of a single integrated global economy.

China joined in 2001, a clear sign of its integration into global market systems.


'''

==  跨国公司 → 对公司管理层有利, 但对底层工人有害 (会因工作转移到低薪国家, 而导致工人失业)

The growing global economic integration represented by the rise of the WTO and regional trading blocs opened new opportunities for multinational corporations (MNC) to extend their reach and influence around the world.

MNCs are not new. Some, like the British East India Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company, exerted great influence during Europe’s imperial expansion in the early modern and modern periods.


'''

===  贸易壁垒降低, 给跨国公司领导层带来的利益 → 工作可外包给低薪国家

Companies in the developed world faced challenges rooted in the high cost of living and resulting high wages they had to pay to their employees. Globalization offered a solution in the form of outsourcing and offshoring.


Multinationals have also benefited greatly from the lowering of trading barriers around the world. In Mexico, for example, workers are paid lower wages than they are in countries like Germany, Japan, South Korea, or the United States. This translates to significant cost savings and thus higher profits for them. And because Mexico is part of a free trade bloc with the United States and Canada, cars made there can be exported for sale in the United States or Canada without the need to pay tariffs.


'''

===  跨国公司, 给本国的底层员工, 带来的伤害 → 工作转移到了低薪外国, 自己失业

Between 1993 and 2021, the United States lost nearly eighteen million manufacturing jobs when some companies found it more profitable to relocate to Mexico. Not all these job losses can be attributed to NAFTA, but many can, as manufacturing that otherwise would have taken place in the United States was moved to maquiladoras, factories in Mexico along the U.S. border that employ people for low wages.

Workers in the automobile industry, once the backbone of the U.S. industrial sector, suffered as jobs and automotive plants were relocated to Mexico.

Some economists, however, argue that the use of inexpensive parts produced in maquiladoras allowed the U.S. automobile industry to survive. Jobs in the clothing industry also declined 85 percent. There were simply fewer obvious advantages to keeping such jobs in the United States.




'''

===  承接外包的低薪国家的公司, 由很难受到监管, 就成为"血汗工厂".

Those hired overseas experienced their own problems, however, because outsourcing often led to the rise of sweatshops, factories where poorly paid workers labor in dangerous environments.


Even when MNCs commit to providing a safe working environment and fair wages abroad, the practice of subcontracting often makes this impossible to guarantee. Foreign companies to whom multinationals send work often distribute it among a number of smaller companies that may also subcontract it, in turn. It is sometimes difficult for MNCs to know exactly where their goods are actually produced and thus to enforce rules about wages and working conditions.


'''

==  对伊斯兰激进主义的打击

In 2011, the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq was completed, eight long years after the invasion. Hopes that peace in Iraq would last were dashed, however, with the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a fundamentalist and militant Islamic group also referred to as the Islamic State.

ISIL leaders proclaimed themselves the heads of a new caliphate, an Islamic state led by a ruler claiming to be a successor to Muhammad, with religious and political authority over all Muslims. This is a claim most of the world’s Muslims reject.


In 2014, it attacked Iraqi security forces and drove them from a number of cities, including Ramadi, Fallujah, and Mosul. In response, a military coalition led by the United States returned to Iraq following a request by the Iraqi government.

Meanwhile, ISIL’s counterpart in Syria, known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, waged war against both the government of Syria and other nonfundamentalist groups that were also seeking to oust Syria’s president Bashar al- Assad. The U.S.-led coalition that returned to Iraq to fight the Islamic State there intervened in Syria as well.
