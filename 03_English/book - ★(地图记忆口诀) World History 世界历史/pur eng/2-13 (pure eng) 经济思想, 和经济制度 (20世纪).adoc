==  20世纪30年代的大萧条

By the 1930s, economic instability had become common as the Great Depression plunged nations into poverty and unemployment. Governments dealt with the downturn in a variety of ways, but solutions in several countries included more authoritarian policies.

===  经济危机的原因

No economic depression is caused by one element alone.

|-> 社会财富分配不均, 造成需求端弱

|Contributing to this financial catastrophe was the unequal distribution of wealth. With consumers both at home and abroad unable to purchase, the twin problems of overproduction and underconsumption ground the economy to a halt.


|-> 互相高关税, 导致贸易战, 又抑制了世界各国的经济发展

|The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was an example of the isolationist and protectionist policies the U.S. government followed in the 1920s. An increased tariff of nearly 40 percent had already been enacted in 1922. Smoot-Hawley raised tariff rates another 20 percent on more than twenty thousand kinds of imported goods, supposedly to protect American farmers and industries from foreign competition. These extreme rates caused other countries to institute their own retaliatory high tariff rates on U.S. goods. Its businesses were unable to recoup any of their monies by selling goods overseas. Smoot-Hawley was the highest tariff the U.S. government has ever enacted. It helped stifle world trade, which decreased 30 percent by the early 1930s.


|-> 美国银行收回对外国的贷款, 造成外国公司资金流断裂, 倒闭, 又抑制了经济发展

|One of the key aspects of the Great Depression was the way it encumbered foreign trade around the globe. Worldwide gross domestic product (GDP)—the value of all the goods and services a country produces in one year—decreased by 15 percent between 1929 and 1932. With trade plummeting, many U.S. banks began recalling loans made to foreign businesses and countries, which caused crises in other places.

|-> 美国人没有储蓄, 造成失业即破产

|When the Depression began, the majority of American families (80 percent) had no savings at all, so a job loss quickly led to homelessness and hunger.


|-> 银行挤兑破产, 导致储户损失所有储蓄, 直接也破产

|The lack of banking regulations meant that if a bank went bankrupt, those who had placed their money on deposit there lost all their savings.


|-> 城市没有农田, 城市人就没有退路, 可以自己种食物吃

|Hunger was a significant problem, particularly in urban areas where there was little chance of having a garden or finding other available foodstuffs. Homeless camps and shantytowns sprang up, but life in such a place was precarious because city officials might force the residents to leave.


|-> 人民越贫穷, 就造成”共产主义”等极端思想盛行

|The inability of capitalist countries to fully solve their economic problems made ideologies such as communism more attractive.  In countries with capitalist systems, the gap between the “haves” and “have-nots” was particularly stark in the 1930s. The appeal of communist ideology grew among some who felt abandoned by the capitalist system, and the prospect of economic equality was its most attractive feature. In other countries, the economic crisis became an opportunity for increased authoritarianism.


The Communist Party experienced substantial growth in many Western democracies in the early 1930s. For some, communism offered not simply economic parity but the prospect of racial parity as well.

=== 如何应对经济危机

There were no easy solutions for any government trying to combat the misery, and different countries adopted different methods to alleviate the suffering of their people.

|-> 放弃金本位制度

|Most countries went off the gold standard—a monetary system in which the value of a currency is tied directly to the value of gold—in the early 1930s, but there was no widespread banking collapse as there was in the United States.


|-> 日本, 执行内循环

|Japan moved into Manchuria in 1931, setting up the state of Manchukuo there the following year. Seizing the region meant Japan would not have to pay for the items it wanted, such as rice, important during a depression that had limited its exports and thus its income from trade.


|-> 发展殖民地经济, 有利于内循环 (让人家富裕起来，他们才有钱买你的商品)

|With the Great Depression came increasing pressure to “do more” with African colonies, as a way for imperial countries to deal with their economic problems. Those that could cultivate greater economic development in the colonies would benefit from increased resources and develop a colonial population with greater buying power for its own goods.

Such development was a slow process in the 1930s, however. The British government enacted a Colonial Development Act at the end of the 1920s that funneled small amounts of money into its African colonies. But larger investments did not flow into Africa until after World War II.

===  经济危机何时结束的

Only the economic stimulation of the onset of World War II brought the world closer to a return of prosperity.


It was only in the late 1930s that the French economy turned around, due to an increase in military equipment production.

==  资源的诅咒

Indeed, they often have more difficulty responding to their domestic needs than countries that are relatively resource-poor. This problem, sometimes dubbed the resource curse, a term coined by British economist Richard Auty in 1993, makes resource-rich countries prone to authoritarianism, high rates of conflict, and low rates of economic growth.

Resource-poor countries typically use citizens’ taxes for the majority of government funding, resulting in greater public scrutiny over how that money is used and governments that are more responsive to public needs.

In contrast, governments in resource-rich countries are able to tap into profit-producing extractive industries like oil production to fund public expenditures. Because that profit is often quite large, opportunities for government corruption abound.



The African country of Angola, rich in diamonds and oil, has struggled with the resource curse. In 2018, oil made up more than 92 percent of its exports, and the oil industry accounted for about a third of its GDP. Much of his power was derived from the oil rents paid to him by oil companies operating in Angola, which he used to oppress his opposition.

==  世界国家的贫富分化情况

As of 2015, approximately 85 percent of the world’s extreme poor (those living on less than $1.90 per day) lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and half of them lived in just five countries: India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ethiopia.


'''

== 游牧民族的消失

The adoption of guns by societies in Europe, Asia, and Africa was the beginning of the end for some nomadic cultures. Beginning in the early modern era, nomadic societies increasingly began to settle down.


原因:

- The adoption of firearms by settled societies undoubtedly jeopardized the continued existence of nomadic societies.


- Modern nation-states also found it easier to tax people who were not always on the move.


- Modern nation-states with permanent borders also objected to nomads crossing at will from one nation into another. They forced them to settle.


- As industrialization made settled life more comfortable, many nomads willingly abandoned their traditional way of life.
