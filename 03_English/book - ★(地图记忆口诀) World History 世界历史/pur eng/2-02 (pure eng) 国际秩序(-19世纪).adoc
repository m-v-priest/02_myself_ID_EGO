== 地理大发现后, 即旧时代的结束, 和全球化的开端 (18-19世纪)

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the world’s great oceans effectively became highways. Communities in Asia, Africa, and the Americas that had once had little or no contact with one another now found themselves enmeshed in a variety of exchanges. Confronted with a changing world, every community made hard decisions.

== 欧洲施行”势力均衡”政策 (1815年后)

The decades before the world erupted into the Great War, as World War I was known, were generally marked by great stability. The work done in 1815 to create a balance of power among European nations in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars had been quite successful. The Concert of Europe — an informal agreement to maintain the status quo—had been able to absorb some internal conflicts and the growth of more liberal political thoughts without incurring political or territorial instability.


There were occasionally military conflicts, but these were usually of short duration and limited in scale. The fighting in these wars was localized, and because they were short, the conflicts did not require the mobilization of a country’s economy or full resources. They did not involve numerous countries either, and the fighting rarely spilled over into other nations’ lands.

== 欧洲形成两大联盟 (德奥意 vs 英法俄, 二十世纪初)

Since he first rose to power in 1862, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck hoped to check the power of Russia and France by developing a series of alliances. A military alliance with Austria-Hungary was created to stand up to Russia. This alliance later grew to include Italy and became formalized as the Triple Alliance.

In 1894, Russia and France signed a treaty pledging military support for one another if attacked and requiring each to mobilize its armies if the other did so. 

In 1907, the Triple Entente was created between Russia, France, and Britain, growing out of a shared distrust of German aims.


By the early twentieth century, then, a series of alliances had effectively divided Europe into two blocs of power. One bloc included Russia, France, and Britain, and the other Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.

While these two groups stood opposed to one another, there were nuances in the arrangements. Britain, for example, had not promised any mutual aid in times of war when it signed its initial agreement with France, nor had it done so in its agreement with Russia, while France was bound to provide military support for Russia if Russia were attacked and not the aggressor.


What these new alliances also did was provide fuel for the German emperor Wilhelm II’s growing concern that he was surrounded by hostile nations. Germany faced a hostile France to its west and Russia to its east.

By the early twentieth century, Europe had achieved outward stability through a series of alliances. Such accords were a hallmark of nineteenth-century diplomacy and had maintained peace for decades on the continent, compressing the wars that did occur into finite conflicts. In the 1900s, these alliances had solidified two opposed groups, each with major powers that allied with one another and then developed relationships with smaller nations.
