==  意大利的早期殖民

Italy was the last European power to establish colonies in Africa.  +
In 1884, an Italian shipping company bought Assab Bay, a port city on the Red Sea, from a local sultan.  +
In 1886, Italy took control of the Egyptian Red Sea port of Massawa at Britain’s urging to prevent France from acquiring more territory in the region.


Italy grasped the parts of Africa that lay unclaimed by other European powers.
