=== feudalism 封建制度

In the ashes of the Carolingian world, medieval Europe embraced a social system called feudalism.

|-> 国王

|However, the need to placate their feudal lords ensured that kings gave away lands and privileges, often weakening them. In other cases, crushing rebellious vassals was a way of taking back needed land.


|-> 封臣

|This service was chiefly military in nature, but it could also include other obligations like advising the lord and attending his court when called.


|-> 农奴

|Some laborers might own their own land and be self-directed, but most in western Europe were unfree, servile laborers called serfs who were tied to the land.

Serfs owed their lord `双宾` a set number of days of service a year (these were many) and could not leave the land, marry, or undertake other work without the lord’s permission.

They were not enslaved and could not be bought or sold, but they occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder.

|===

While feudalism was not a political system, warriors owed service to lords who owed service to the king, who in theory was the largest landowner in the kingdom and the guarantor of rights and privileges.

Politically, thirteenth-century Europe was a series of confederations of warriors who had sworn oaths of vassalage, or loyalty, to one of the titular European kings. There were no real centralized governments, courts, or bureaucracies. The real power of kings rested on the willingness of their vassals to provide them with the support they had pledged.

|-> (意大利) 梅尔菲宪章 (1231年)

|The monarchy established secular political control through the 1231 Constitutions of Melfi, considered the oldest surviving written constitution in the world. The Constitutions of Melfi increased the power of the monarch by replacing vassals and church officials with royal bureaucrats as local administrators and judges.  The state created by the Constitutions of Melfi resisted church encroachment on its authority better than the Holy Roman Empire had.

The bureaucracy was funded by revenue from royal monopolies on essential products like salt, iron, and copper, along with tariffs and tolls.



|-> (法国) 君主直接任命中央官员, 来管理地方 , 而不是将土地交给封臣(诸侯)来管理.

|A stronger central government also emerged in France over the thirteenth century. French monarchs exploited opportunities to add to their royal holdings by taking land from their nobles. These new lands were managed by salaried royal appointees, not vassals who could pass their holdings to heirs.

By the early fourteenth century, much of France was under direct royal control, greatly enhancing the resources French kings could call upon in conflicts with their vassals and the church.

|-> 火药的应用(枪支), 降低了使用武器的难度, 骑士就没落了.

|In most societies, male members of the nobility, often the only ones who could afford to purchase and pay for the upkeep of horses, had formed the core of the fighting forces. Their role as society’s defenders helped to justify the exalted position their class occupied. When handheld guns became common, armed peasant infantrymen supplanted the mounted elite. The loss of their warrior role often marked the beginning of the decline in the power of the aristocracy.


|-> 更高科技武器技术的发展,  将”军费”提高, 让君主与封臣在这场军费竞争中, 君主更有财力胜出, 导致君权扩大.

|Nobles found it difficult to challenge the power of rulers whose cannon could destroy their castles. Gunpowder thus helped to develop centralized states in Europe.

- Western Europeans discovered recipes for gunpowder in Arabic texts brought back from the Crusades +

=== 封建制度的被取代 → 君权受到制约, 民权扩大

==== 英国

England developed differently than other European states. The monarch’s power over its vassals and the church was limited from the thirteenth century onward, and the basic rights of commoners were protected.


[.small]

|-> 规定: 君权不能削弱教会权利

|King John’s vassals compelled him in 1215 to reaffirm those rights and expand them in Magna Carta, a document that reiterated existing rights and relationships of vassals. The document confirmed the papal position that the church was above the state and “shall have its rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired... by our heirs in perpetuity.”


|-> 建立”含有平民代表”的议会

|The other key development leading toward centralized government with limited and specified powers was the creation of a deliberative body of nobles, clergy, and commoners that replaced the Great Council of the king’s vassals and high clergy. This new body evolved into Parliament, designed to represent the interests of the people. Membership was expanded to representatives elected by the vassals of the king’s vassals, and starting in 1265, selected towns could send representatives to speak for the interests of merchants.


|-> 该议会的权力: 批准法律

|Parliament had two primary powers. One was to approve all tax increases.

To establish uniform rule by the monarch, as opposed to a decentralized set of laws from the nobility and a potentially conflicting set from the church, Edward I asked Parliament to also approve laws.

Parliamentary approval made the laws England’s laws, not just the king’s laws. Even if the king had drafted them, the nobles, clergy, and wealthy commoners had to agree to them.




|-> 建立陪审团

|Among the rights spelled out in Magna Carta, perhaps the most important was that “no free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals.” This requirement created a precedent for trial by jury, which remains a staple of the judicial system in the West to the present day.

== (西欧) 君主集权

==== 绝对君主制 (16, 17世纪出现)

Absolute monarchies appeared in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as feudalism declined and new countries arose from medieval kingdoms.


These new nation-states were characterized by


[.small]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|-> 君主不服从教皇, 也不与贵族阶层分享权力

|At the head of the state stood a monarch (usually a king) who claimed a divine right to rule. The medieval concept of monarchy had regarded kings as subservient to the pope, but absolute monarchs considered themselves subordinate to no one. They could rule as they wished with no need to confer with or seek the consent of others, or to share power with the noble class as medieval monarchs had done.


|-> 君主自己一人做出任何政策.

|Absolute monarchs proclaimed their own laws, formulated foreign policy, administered justice (or appointed those who did so), and imposed taxes as they wished. They were the sole source of authority in their lands and often took steps to weaken the power of their nobles so they did not pose a threat to their rule.


|-> 中央进行集权管理

|centralized administrations and codified laws.


|-> 君主自己养军队, 不再靠封臣来提供

|They were guarded by professional standing armies, not noble vassals at the head of their own private armies.

=== 法国的君主集权

The most powerful of the absolute monarchies was France, and Louis XIV, who became king of France in 1643, was the epitome of a divine-right monarch.

|-> 剥夺贵族权力

|Unwilling to share power with the higherranked members of the French nobility, who had been responsible for numerous revolts against the French monarchy in the decades before he came to the throne, Louis deprived them of any role in governing or administering the state.


|-> 削弱贵族的财富

|He required that they live with him at his magnificent palace in Versailles, where they were invited to spend their time and money (which might otherwise have been used to plot revolts) in putting on displays of ostentatious living and competing with one another for the king’s favor.


|-> 君主自己来颁布法律

|All state matters were rigorously scrutinized by Louis, and he promulgated legal codes for France’s colonies. “L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state”), he once famously proclaimed.
