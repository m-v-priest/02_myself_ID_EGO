== 了解历史, 能带给我们什么利益? (以史为鉴)

|-> 了解我们为什么是现在这个样子, 我们的善, 我们的恶.

|It is a path to knowing why we are the way we are — all our greatness, all our faults — and therefore a means for us to understand ourselves and change for the better. But history serves this function only if it is a true reflection of the past. It cannot be a way to mask the darker parts of human nature, nor a way to justify acts of previous generations.


|-> 吸取前人的教训

|“Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” Yet because history is an everchanging collection of events influenced and shaped by a variety of causes and outcomes, it never truly repeats at all.




|-> 提升你的"批判性思维"和"分析能力”

|The study of history will also enhance your critical-thinking and analytical ability. +



Other skills that have become increasingly important include adaptive thinking, social intelligence, cross-cultural competency, and media literacy. +


|-> 令你能保持思想的开放性, 而不是思维局限或走极端

|It also hones a creative mindset that is flexible and open to interpretations and ideas outside our own worldview.


|-> 培养”讲能吸引人的故事”的能力

|Historians must also be effective communicators. Who cares about a story nobody reads or a product nobody buys?

|-> 兼听则明, 偏听则暗. 要从不同背景领域的当事人角度, 同时看他们的评价, 之后再做出你的综合判定.

|The bottom line is that interpretation plays a central role in the field of history. The danger lies in using only one lens. Yes, historians choose some causes as more important than others, but only after considering all the information available.  +

== 寻找"因果关系"的方法


=== 不同原因, 有不同权重影响力 (不同刺激力度)

In 1453, Mehmed II laid siege to the city of Constantinople. Why?  +

- Mehmed II was the leader of the Ottoman Empire, the sultan. He had been badly treated by his father, and when he ascended the throne, he felt he had something to prove.
- The Ottomans had tried several times to take Constantinople because it lay at the crossroads of many civilizations. +
- Conquest had long been a reliable mechanism for bringing new people and wealth into the Ottoman Empire and for keeping its economy prosperous.

All these factors played a role in the siege undertaken by Mehmed II. Can you order them by importance?


This is the point where historians usually disagree, even about events for which most of the facts are clear.

|-> 我们无法知道所有历史事实

|Will history ever be a perfect telling of the human tale? No. There are voices we may never hear.



|-> 不同当事人的认知可能不同, 回忆也可能有扭曲

|You will engage with firsthand accounts of key people and events — including instances in which people’s recollections of the same events might differ.

== 对历史看法的思想 演进

[.small]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|(以前) 进步史学: 认为人类历史是线性发展的, 从低级到高级

|One of the early European schools of thought was progressive history, which viewed history as a straight line to a specific destination. Historians with this “progressive” view believed societies were becoming more democratic over time. Their perspective might also be considered a form of teleological history, which proposes that history is moving to a particular end.

Progressive historians believed in the betterment of people and of society, so long as it occurred on a European model. Progress looked only one way: the Western way.


|(如今) 重视研究”人类是如何做出决策的”

|In the twentieth century, particularly after World War I, the idea of inevitable human progress seemed laughable. People grew more willing to question the authority of elites. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the psychology behind people’s choices. This is one reason for the rise of contemporary intellectual history, which looks at the ideas that drive people to make certain choices and focuses on philosophical questions and the history of human thought.


Our belief systems are informed by social constructs, ideas that have been created and accepted by the people in a society, such as the concepts of class distinction and gender. Social constructs influence the ways people think and behave.


For example, consider the following questions:


- What do you buy a five-year-old girl for her birthday? What do you buy for a boy the same age? What influenced your decision?


- To which person standing at the front of a classroom would you give more respect: a woman dressed in a tailored suit, or a man wearing jeans and a t-shirt? Why?

== 史料

=== 一手史料, 和二手史料

There are two main kinds of historical sources, primary and secondary. +


[.small]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|一手史料 : 来自历史当事人自身 (如, 政府文件, 当事人日记, 信件等)

|Primary sources, when we have them, are considered more valuable than other sources because they are as close in time as we can get to the events being studied.


Think, for example, of a court trial: The ideal is to have the trial quickly so that witness testimony is fresher and therefore more reliable. With the passage of time, people can forget, they might subconsciously add or take away parts of a memory, and they may be influenced to interpret events differently. +


|二手史料 : 来自其他人对历史当事人的研究

|A secondary source is one written or created after the fact.  +

|===



Good research requires both types of sources and some attention to historiography, which is the study of how other historians have already interpreted and written about the past. +


'''

===  文字史料更有价值

History technically begins with the advent of writing. For historians, the written word is more accurate evidence for building narratives of the past.

For example, imagine a modern magazine with a rock or pop star on the front, dressed for performance in a vibrant or provocative style. If that were the only piece of evidence that existed five hundred years from now, how would historians interpret our era? Without context, interpretation of the past is quite difficult. Studying artifacts is certainly worthwhile, but text offers us greater clarity. Even if the cover of the magazine bore only a caption, like “Pop star rising to the top of the charts,” future historians would have significantly more information than from the photo alone.


'''

=== 古代地图的编制, 是带有当事人的主观倾向的

Maps are some of the most contested pieces of historical evidence we have because they were almost always made from the perspective of the one making the map, not as an objective practice.


'''

=== 如何判断史料的真伪, 可信度价值

Historians evaluate the strength of both primary and secondary sources, especially online. How do we decide what a good source is? Always make sure you can tell who is producing the website. Is it a scholar, a museum, or a research organization?


- Does the source tell you where it got the information? +


- Are those sources in turn objective and reliable? +


- Can you corroborate the site’s information? You should see whether other sources present similar data. +


'''

=== ★★ 如何判断”某史料为什么会那样写”? 作者有什么目的意图, 或被迫不得已的背景压力? 才导致他这么说, 这么写.

Consider the act of reading a poem. You can read the surface of a poem, the literal meaning of the words presented. But that seldom reflects the true meaning the poet meant to convey. You must also look for nuances, hidden meanings, or repeated metaphors. We approach a primary source in a similar way.


There are four key areas to consider when interpreting sources: the author, the audience, the intent, and the context.  A deeper inspection might reveal hidden motives. Most text-based sources have meanings beyond the obvious, and it is the historian’s job to uncover these.

|1.作者的身份立场是什么, 作者是谁?
|
    - Who authored the source and why?
    - Is the author responsible for simply recording the information, or was the author involved in the event? +

|2.受众(作者在说给谁听)
|
- For whom was it written?  Was it meant to be public or private? Is it a letter to a friend or an essay submitted for publication?


- What kind of source is it? Government documents have a different purpose than personal diaries. A former president commenting on a political issue has a different view from a comedian doing the same.


|3.意图(作者这样说的目的是什么), 及他所说的是否真实? 而非带有谎言掩饰. 或刻意营造.
|
- You should think about the intent: Is the author reliable, or does the author have an agenda? Why might the author have written what they did? Why was the document written? Was it intended to be a factual account of an event? Was it meant to persuade?  Could the writer have been fending off an attack or lobbying for one?


- Is it a complete falsification? Often people write things that present them in the best light rather than reveal weaknesses.


- The different types of language used in a source are clues to its interpretation. Linguists call the use of language rhetoric. Rhetorical choices, decisions about the way words are used and put together, are often deliberate and intended to achieve a certain outcome.

.案例
====


例:

The exterior of Hagia Sophia was decorated with Greek iconography. Churches at the time were meant to inspire awe; because most people could not read, stories of religious figures and events were told through highly decorative and symbolic images. Obedience and a desire to join a religious community could be motivated by the buildings’ grandeur. +

As you study the renderings, reflect on the following questions: What are the key features of the building? What does it make you think about? What would you think about it if you were a poor sixth-century farmer, an urban merchant of some wealth, or a foreign leader?

.案例
====
例:

President Franklin D. Roosevelt went to Congress and asked for a declaration of war against Japan. The speech he gave, however, was about more than this request. Roosevelt used certain words to highlight that the attack was secret and calculated. He also suggested that God was on the side of the United States. As you read, pay special attention to the words Roosevelt uses. Can you pick out a few key rhetorical choices?


====


|4.上下文(作者发言时所处的背景环境是何种状态)
|
- What is the historical context? What is the general time period of the document, and what was that time like? Is it a time of war or peace? Is there religious conflict? Is there an economic crisis? A health crisis? A natural disaster? +


- What was happening when the individual wrote the document? Was there any sort of intimidation or distress? Are we missing other perspectives or voices we would like to hear? +
