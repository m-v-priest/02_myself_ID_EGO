==  伊斯兰教认为, 自己拥有最正统的上帝经文

From the perspective of most Muslims, Islam is the same faith as Judaism and Christianity, with adherents of all three traditions worshipping the same God and recognizing divine intercession in humanity through the leadership of the prophets.

从大多数穆斯林的角度来看，伊斯兰教, 与犹太教和基督教是相同的信仰，所有三种传统的信徒, 都崇拜同一个上帝，并承认, 通过先知的领导来实现"神在人类中的干预"。

Muslims also recognize the holy scriptures of Judaism and Christianity as having been given to humans by God but then corrupted over time.

Muslims have believed throughout their history that Islam and its holy writings are not a new faith created in the seventh century. Instead, the faith that Muhammad brought to the Arabs in the early 600s was merely a corrective to the monotheistic religions that had come before.

Islam thus sees itself as a purer form of these faiths and directly connected to both.

穆斯林还承认犹太教和基督教的神圣经文, 是上帝赐予人类的，但随着时间的推移逐渐被篡改了。

穆斯林在他们的整个历史中, 一直相信伊斯兰教, 及其神圣著, 作并不是七世纪创建的新信仰。相反，穆罕默德在 600 年代初期带给阿拉伯人的信仰, 仅仅是对之前的"一神论宗教"的纠正。

因此，伊斯兰教将自己视为这些信仰的更纯粹的形式，并与这两种信仰直接相关。

'''

==  但伊斯兰教, 有着许多属于阿拉伯人特有的特征 → (先知)穆罕穆德是阿拉伯人, 他的活动也几乎多在阿拉伯地区.

For all the influence that other monotheistic worship in the region may have had on the formation of Islam in the seventh century, however, the faith has many features we might consider uniquely Arab or Arabian.

First, of course, is the setting itself. While the land that is modern Israel and Palestine played a central role in the narratives of Judaism and Christianity, much of the story of the formation of Islam as a distinct religion is found in western Arabia, a region of the peninsula known as the Hijaz. Its holiest sites lie in this region, and the life of its founder was spent almost entirely there.

But more influential than anything, perhaps, was the Muslims’ belief in the leadership and message of the man whom God chose as his final prophet, an Arab of the early seventh century from the Hijaz of western Arabia.

尽管该地区的其他"一神教"崇拜, 可能对七世纪伊斯兰教的形成产生了影响，但这种信仰有许多我们可以认为是阿拉伯或阿拉伯人特有的特征。

首先，当然是设定本身。虽然现代以色列和巴勒斯坦这片土地, 在犹太教和基督教的叙述中, 发挥了核心作用，但伊斯兰教作为一种独特宗教形成的大部分故事, 都发生在阿拉伯半岛西部，即被称为"希贾兹"的半岛地区。它最神圣的地方, 就在这个地区，其创始人的一生, 几乎都是在那里度过的。

但最有影响力的, 也许是穆斯林对"真主"选择作为他最后一位先知(穆罕默德)的领导和信息的信仰，他是一位七世纪初的阿拉伯人, 来自阿拉伯西部"汉志"。

At the center of the founding of Islam are the city of Mecca, the worship of one God—Allah—and the leadership of the prophets.

伊斯兰教建立的中心, 是麦加城、对唯一的真主"安拉"的崇拜, 以及先知的领导。

'''

==  一神论 → (真主)安拉, 即基督教中的上帝

Islam, a word meaning “submission [to the one God].” Islam is a monotheistic faith.

伊斯兰教，这个词的意思是“服从[独一的真主]”。伊斯兰教是一种一神论信仰.

Even to Muslims today, Allah is not considered to be a god separate from the God of Judaism and Christianity; Allah is simply the Arabic word meaning “the one God.” In fact, Christians who live in the Middle East and speak Arabic today refer to the God of the Christian Bible by using the word “Allah” in their own worship.

即使对于今天的穆斯林来说，安拉也不被认为是与犹太教和基督教的上帝分开的神。安拉（Allah）是阿拉伯语，意思是“独一的神”。事实上，今天生活在中东, 并讲阿拉伯语的基督徒, 在他们自己的崇拜中使用“安拉”一词来指代基督教圣经中的上帝。

'''

==  (先知) 亚伯拉罕

The modern monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have a great deal in common with one another, including a number of traditions and beliefs. At the center of these shared traditions is the worship of one god, but the leadership of the prophets—individuals who were chosen to receive messages to humankind from God—is shared, too.

犹太教、基督教, 和伊斯兰教等现代"一神论"宗教, 彼此有很多共同点. 这些共同传统的核心, 是对一位神的崇拜，但"先知（被选中从上帝那里向人类传达信息的个人）的领导权", 也是共同的。

Perhaps no prophetic figure is quite as central in all three faiths as the prophet Abraham. Abraham was a patriarch of the Israelites in Jewish and Christian tradition. In one of the bestknown stories from the scripture featuring him, he was willing to sacrifice his own son if necessary in order to obey his God.

Islamic tradition holds that he is also the ancestor of all the Arabs.

也许没有哪个先知人物像"亚伯拉罕"那样, 在所有三种信仰中占据中心地位。在犹太教和基督教的传统中，亚伯拉罕是以色列人的族长。在圣经中一个关于他的著名故事中，他愿意在必要时牺牲自己的儿子, 来服从他的上帝。

伊斯兰传统认为, 他也是所有阿拉伯人的祖先。

The shared history and lineage of the three run through the prophet Abraham, whom all list as an ancestor. Many modern scholars of religion thus refer to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the Abrahamic faiths.

三大宗教的共同历史和渊源, 可以追溯到先知"亚伯拉罕"，三大宗教都将其视为共同的祖先。因此，许多现代宗教学者, 称犹太教、基督教和伊斯兰教为"亚伯拉罕宗教"。

'''

==  (最后一位先知) 穆罕默德 (约570-632)

Muslims believe that as generations passed, however, the descendants of Ishmael, the Arabs, forgot their monotheism and began to worship idols, entering a period of ignorance known as the jahiliyyah. There they remained until God sent a new prophet, Muhammad, to correct their religious practices and deliver them from ignorance and disbelief. This lapse and deliverance, according to the faithful, is the story of Islam.

然而，穆斯林相信，随着世代的流逝，"以实玛利"的后裔阿拉伯人, 忘记了他们的一神教, 并开始崇拜偶像，进入了被称为“贾希利耶”的无知时期。他们一直留在那里，直到真主派遣一位新的先知"穆罕默德"来纠正他们的宗教习俗，并将他们从无知和怀疑中解救出来. 根据信徒的说法，这种失误和拯救, 就是伊斯兰教的故事。(本质就是一个"迷失自我, 找回初心"的故事)

Muslim tradition tells us that Muhammad was a merchant from a prominent Arab tribe called Quraysh in the Hijaz region. He was born in the city of Mecca.

According to Muslim belief, in the year 610 the middle-aged Muhammad, who had traveled to a cave just outside Mecca for contemplation, received contact from God through the intermediary of the angel Gabriel (Jabrīl in Arabic). Muhammad was told to recite the first revelations of a scripture that became the Muslim holy book, the Quran.

穆斯林传统告诉我们，穆罕默德是一个商人，来自汉志地区一个著名的阿拉伯部落，名叫"古莱什"。他出生于麦加城.

根据穆斯林的信仰，公元610年，中年穆罕默德前往"麦加"郊外的一个山洞进行沉思，通过天使"加百利" （阿拉伯语为"贾布里尔"）的中介, 得到了与真主的联系。穆罕默德被告知, 要背诵一部后来成为穆斯林圣书 《古兰经》的经文的第一个启示。

His career as a prophet, especially the first twelve years, was fraught with challenge. His preaching of monotheism upset the political status quo and was often resisted.

In 622, Muhammad’s twelfth year of prophecy, his community fled persecution and increasing aggression by the polytheist Meccans. They were invited to join another community of Arabs in a city called Yathrib, later known as Medina, “the city” or more specifically “the prophet’s city.”

他作为先知的职业生涯，尤其是头十二年，充满了挑战。他宣扬的一神教扰乱了政治现状，经常遭到抵制。

622 年，即穆罕默德预言的第十二年，他的社群逃离了"多神教"麦加人的迫害, 和日益加剧的侵略。他们被邀请加入另一个阿拉伯社区，该社区位于一个名为"亚斯里布"（Yathrib）的城市，后来被称为"麦地那" （Medina） ，“城市”，或更具体地说“先知之城”.

This hijra, meaning “emigration,” was a watershed moment for Muhammad’s early community. At a low ebb and without any certainty of survival, Islam now changed from a small religion mostly confined to Mecca to a larger community united by Muhammad that solidified its place in world history.

The hijra holds such importance in the history of Islam that the Islamic lunar calendar counts 622 CE as its first year. (Dates in the Muslim calendar, used by many around the world today, are often labeled in English with AH, for “After the Hijra.”)

这次希吉拉（hijra ）的意思是“移民”，对于穆罕默德的早期社区来说是一个分水岭。在低潮时期，没有任何生存的确定性，伊斯兰教现在从一个主要局限于"麦加"的小宗教，变成了一个由穆罕默德联合的更大的社区，巩固了它在世界历史上的地位。

hijra 在伊斯兰教历史上占有如此重要的地位，以至于伊斯兰农历将公元 622 年作为其第一年。 （当今世界上许多人在使用的"穆斯林日历"中的日期, 通常用英文标记为 AH，就是表示“hijra之后”。）

In Medina, the previously polytheist Arabs, Jewish Arabs, and Muhammad’s ummah formed an alliance for their common defense. Muhammad served first as an arbiter of disputes between the tribes and, soon after, as the city’s de facto leader.

Under his guidance, the community devised the Constitution of Medina. Later Muslim rulers saw the constitution as a blueprint for the creation of a religious society that tolerated those of other faiths. The phrases most commonly used in the constitution to describe Muhammad’s followers are “Muslims” (“those who have submitted to God”) and “believers” (al-Mu’minun). For this reason, some historians have described the earliest ummah as a “community of believers” that was open to most monotheists.

在麦地那，以前信奉多神教的阿拉伯人、犹太阿拉伯人, 和穆罕默德的"乌玛"结成联盟，共同防御。穆罕默德首先担任部落之间争端的仲裁者，不久之后，成为这座城市事实上的领袖。

在他的指导下，社区制定了《麦地那宪法》. 后来的穆斯林统治者, 将宪法视为创建宗教社会的蓝图，该社会容忍其他信仰. 宪法中最常用于描述穆罕默德追随者的短语, 是“穆斯林”（“服从真主的人”）和“信徒”（ al-Mu’minun ）。因此，一些历史学家将最早的"乌玛", 描述为对大多数"一神论者"开放的 “信徒社区”。

In these earliest decades of Islam, Muhammad’s new community had much in common with the monotheistic Jewish people and Christians, and we find little evidence of the distinctive Muslim identity that formed over the next several centuries.

在伊斯兰教的最初几十年里，穆罕默德的新群体, 与一神论的犹太人和基督徒, 有很多共同点. 在他们身上, 我们还几乎找不到"在接下来的几个世纪中, 会形成的独特的穆斯林身份"的证据。

Muhammad spent much of the last ten years of his life with the new Muslim community in Medina, engaged in conflict with their former brethren in Mecca. Fighting between the two sides was fierce, and there were also tensions within Medina and the early ummah as Muhammad’s followers grew in number and prominence at the expense of other Arabs in the city, in particular, the Jewish contingent.

Muhammad’s community continued to grow and win more supporters until, on the eve of battle outside Mecca in 630, his former tribe of Quraysh surrendered, and the population of the city converted to Islam.

Muhammad and his followers were then able to return to Mecca, where he entered the holy sanctuary of the Kaaba, now filled with the polytheist idols worshipped by the Arabs, and smashed them all. From the perspective of Muslims, the original house of Abraham, which had always been dedicated to the worship of the one God, was now cleansed.

穆罕默德生命最后十年的大部分时间, 是在"麦地那"这个新的穆斯林社区中度过的，他们与"麦加"的前弟兄发生了冲突。双方之间的战斗非常激烈.

"麦地那"和早期"乌玛"内部也存在紧张关系，因为穆罕默德的追随者数量和地位不断增长，而牺牲了城市中的其他阿拉伯人，特别是犹太人队伍。

穆罕默德的团体不断壮大，并赢得了更多的支持者，直到公元630年"麦加"城外的战争前夕，他以前的"古莱什"部落投降，该城的居民皈依了伊斯兰教。

穆罕默德和他的追随者们回到了麦加，在那里他进入了神圣的天房，现在到处都是阿拉伯人崇拜的"多神教"偶像，他们把他们都打碎了。从穆斯林的角度来看，亚伯拉罕原来的家，一直致力于崇拜"唯一的上帝"，现在被净化了。

To embrace Islam as their religion, adherents must recognize the creed that “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.” Muhammad, as recognized by Muslims, was the final prophet in a long list with whom the one God had communicated throughout history, including figures such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Muhammad was a divinely chosen man who is not, nor ever has been, worshipped as a God or as a relative of God himself.

要接受"伊斯兰教"作为他们的宗教，信徒必须承认 “万物非主，唯有真主，穆罕默德是真主的使者”的信条。穆斯林所承认的穆罕默德, 是"真主"在整个历史中与他沟通过的一长串"先知名单"中的最后一位先知，名单中包括: 亚当、诺亚、亚伯拉罕、摩西, 和耶稣等人物。穆罕默德是神选的人，他没有、也从来没有被当作神或神的亲戚来崇拜。

Many Muslims throughout history have avoided depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad in human form in their art, with some feeling that portraying the Prophet could be misconstrued as idolatrous, or revering something (or someone) besides God.

历史上许多穆斯林, 都避免在他们的艺术中, 以"人形"描绘伊斯兰先知穆罕默德. 有些人认为, 描绘先知可能会被误解为偶像崇拜，或尊崇到真主之外的某物（或某人）.

Belief in the one God and the message of the Islamic prophet Muhammad is the first and most important of the “Five Pillars of Islam,” known as the shahada, the profession of faith.

==  the Quran 古兰经  &  hadith 圣训

The crucial early years of Islamic expansion were overseen by the first four caliphs, a group of rulers who came to be called the “rightly guided” or Rashidun. These four figures—Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and the originally overlooked son-in-law of Muhammad, Ali—ruled between 632 and 661, a period when much Byzantine and Persian territory was conquered.

伊斯兰扩张的关键早期岁月, 是由前四位哈里发监督的，这群统治者后来被称为“正统”或“拉希敦”。这四位人物——阿布·伯克尔（Abu Bakr ）、欧麦尔（Umar） 、奥斯曼（Othman ）和原本被忽视的穆罕默德女婿阿里（Ali） ——在 632 年至 661 年间统治，这一时期, 拜占庭和波斯的大部分领土被伊斯兰征服.

The Rashidun caliphs are remembered not just for overseeing the process of conquest in the region but also for helping to articulate what Muhammad’s ummah should look like, and what made Islam different from other monotheistic religions such as Judaism and Christianity. The first four caliphs committed to writing a canonized Quran and helped interpret and articulate the religious law.

拉希顿的哈里发们, 之所以被人们铭记，不仅是因为他们监督了该地区的征服过程，还因为他们帮助阐明了穆罕默德的"乌玛"应该是什么样子，以及伊斯兰教与犹太教和基督教等其他"一神论"宗教的不同之处。前四位哈里发, 致力于撰写一部经典的《古兰经》 ，并帮助解释和阐明宗教法。

Together, the Quran and the hadith make up the bulk of religious law for Muslims to the present day, and the Rashidun caliphs have long been regarded as interpreters of this material for later Muslims who were not able to interact with Muhammad themselves.

《古兰经》和《圣训》一起, 构成了当今穆斯林"宗教法"的主体，而"拉什顿哈里发"长期以来一直被视为这些材料的解释者，为后来无法与穆罕默德互动的穆斯林, 提供了依据。

Quran : the holy scripture of Islam, which Muslims believe was given to humanity by God through Muhammad.

古兰经: 伊斯兰教的圣经，穆斯林相信, 它是上帝通过穆罕默德赐予人类的.

hadith : the words and actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his immediate successors that, along with the Quran, form the fundamental basis for Islamic law

圣训: 伊斯兰先知穆罕默德及其直接继承者的言行, 与《古兰经》一起, 构成了"伊斯兰法"的基础.

'''

==  伊斯兰法律的解释权, 从caliph 哈里发手中, 转到了ulama 手中 → ulama  乌理玛; 穆斯林学者、宗教领袖 (相当于美国的大法官, 有权利解释司法)

As the Abbasids came to power, a religious clerical class also arose within Islam. Known as the ulama (literally “the scholars”), they came to hold an increasingly important role as the interpreters of Islamic law within non-Shia, Sunni Islam during the Abbasid period.

随着阿拔斯王朝掌权，伊斯兰教内部, 也兴起了一个宗教神职人员阶级。他们被称为“乌里玛”（字面意思是“学者”），在阿拔斯王朝时期，他们在"非什叶派、逊尼派伊斯兰教"中作为"伊斯兰法律"的解释者, 发挥着越来越重要的作用.

The role of the caliph as a leader in the Islamic world also began to change dramatically in the Middle Ages. Before the Abbasid period, the early caliphs had successfully made a case for being vested with both secular and religious authority, including the ability to interpret the scripture and issue religious proclamations.

"哈里发"作为伊斯兰世界领袖的角色, 在中世纪也开始发生巨大变化。在阿拔斯时期之前，早期的"哈里发"成功地确立了自己同时拥有"世俗"和"宗教"权威的合法性，包括"解释经文"和"发布宗教法令"的能力 (即将"美国大法官"和"美国议会"的功能, 合二为一了)。

As the ulama acquired a more prominent role in Abbasid society, however, they claimed more of this power and authority for themselves, diminishing the religious entitlements that earlier caliphs had claimed.

As the centuries passed, the religious role of the caliph weakened further, and the decision to compile and write down the hadith, which had been transmitted only orally for the bulk of the first two centuries, gave further authority to the keepers and teachers of this material at the expense of the caliph within early Sunni Islam.

然而，随着"乌理玛"（伊斯兰学者）在阿拔斯社会中获得更加突出的地位，他们逐渐把更多这种权力和权威, 归于自己，削弱了早期"哈里发"声称的宗教权利。

随着时间的推移，"哈里发"的宗教角色进一步削弱，而对"圣训"（先知穆罕默德的言行记录）的编纂和书写工作，也使得这些材料的保管者和传授者, 在早期"逊尼派伊斯兰教"中获得了更多权威，进一步削弱了"哈里发"的地位。

'''

==  逊尼派(偏民主派) vs 什叶派(血统继承派)

The catalyst for the formation of denominations within Islam was a growing divide between the groups now known as the Sunni and the Shia (sometimes written as Shi‘ite), the two primary “umbrella sects” within Islam.

Sunni Muslims believed that the leader of the Muslim community should be elected through consensus, while Shia Muslims believed that leadership should be based on hereditary descent from Prophet Muhammad.

伊斯兰教内形成”教派分裂”的催化剂, 是现在被称为逊尼派和什叶派（有时写为什叶派）群体之间日益扩 大的分歧. 这两个群体是伊斯兰教内的两个主要“伞教派”。

逊尼派穆斯林认为，穆斯林社会的领袖应该通过协商一致选举产生，而什叶派穆斯林则认为领导权应该基于先知穆罕默德的世袭血统。

==  (朝圣) 麦加 → 目的是, 角色扮演cosplay亲自体验”先知经历过的人生重要时刻” (即类似于中共的红色旅游, 重走长征路)

The house of worship he constructed in Mecca, in western Arabia, has become a revered site of pilgrimage for Muslims around the world.

One of the core tenets or “Five Pillars” of Islam is participation in the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. This event, when undertaken during the month of Dhu al-Hijja, is known as the hajj. Each year millions of Muslims travel to the holy city to take part in a process that has been going on for almost fourteen hundred years.

While Mecca was the home of the prophet Muhammad, for Muslims the pilgrimage is about much more. The rituals and events in which they participate are intended to reenact important events in the life of a different prophet, Abraham.

(先知亚伯拉罕)他在阿拉伯西部的"麦加"建造的礼拜堂，已成为世界各地穆斯林崇敬的朝圣地。

伊斯兰教的核心信条, 或“五大支柱”之一是, 参加圣城"麦加"朝圣。这项活动在 Dhu al-Hijja 月举行，被称为"朝觐"。每年都有数以百万计的穆斯林前往圣城, 参加一个已经持续了近1400年的过程。

虽然"麦加"是先知穆罕默德的故乡，但对于穆斯林来说，朝圣的意义远不止于此。他们参加的仪式和活动, 旨在重现另一位先知"亚伯拉罕"生活中的重要事件。(就像信徒在cosplay角色扮演 祖先"先知"的伟大时刻一样)

Islamic law recognizes that the hajj is not a trip every Muslim will be able to take. Some may not be healthy enough, and Islamic charitable organizations around the world collect donations to support those who cannot otherwise afford it.

伊斯兰教法承认, "朝觐"不是每个穆斯林都能在经济上负担的起的旅行。有些人可能身体健康不行，世界各地的伊斯兰慈善组织, 会收集捐款, 来支持那些无法负担得起的人。

Pilgrims may also travel to the holy mosque during other times of the year, which is not considered as having made the hajj but is instead called the umra, the “lesser pilgrimage.”

朝圣者也可以在一年中的其他时间, 前往”神圣清真寺”， 这不被认为是朝觐，而是被称为“umra ”，即“较小的朝圣”。

==  天房 (在麦加城中. 天房建造有两种说法: ①由”亚伯拉罕”建造. ②由上帝创造的第一个人类”亚当”建造, 后”亚伯拉罕”重建)

The story of Abraham, called Ibrahim, within Islam is an important one. According to Islamic tradition, he was the first person to settle in what later became the city of Mecca. There he constructed the Kaaba, considered by Muslims to be the house of God and the most sacred site in Islam. The Kaaba is the black-shrouded cube structure at the center, believed to be the original home of monotheism.

Some Muslims believe the Kaaba was constructed by Adam, the first man, and then reconstructed by Abraham.

亚伯拉罕（又名易卜拉欣）的故事, 在伊斯兰教中是一个重要的故事。根据伊斯兰传统，他是第一个在后来成为"麦加城"的地方定居的人。他在那里建造了"天房", 穆斯林认为这是上帝的殿堂，也是伊斯兰教最神圣的地方。天房的中心, 是黑色笼罩的立方体结构，被认为是"一神教"的发源地。

一些穆斯林则认为"天房"是由第一个人"亚当"建造的，然后由"亚伯拉罕"重建。
